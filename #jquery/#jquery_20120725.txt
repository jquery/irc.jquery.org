[00:00:29] <Whirl3d__> fiddle?
[00:00:36] <Whirl3d__> should work
[00:00:48] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/uguyis/edit
[00:01:40] <Andweeeee> that is the coolest shit ever.
[00:01:54] <tw2113> what? jsbin/jsfiddle?
[00:02:27] <Andweeeee> jsbin. jsfiddle is tits too, but does jsbin thing update in real time?
[00:02:37] <tw2113> yup
[00:02:40] <Andweeeee> like if i edit it and you edit it, could we like
[00:02:41] <Andweeeee> do that
[00:02:43] <Andweeeee> dude
[00:02:48] <Andweeeee> that's like a videogame.
[00:02:57] <tw2113> thank @rem on twitter
[00:03:09] <tw2113> or remysharp in here  :D Hi Remy
[00:03:38] <Whirl3d__> So you wanted to update the selector after switching classes.
[00:03:52] <Andweeeee> wait, so do you guys wanna like…. do that….we could make some cool shit. I've got fuck all to do right now, but i call dibs on css.
[00:06:46] <Whirl3d__> tw2113, it works you just tried to switch classes with a class that wasn't there.
[00:07:13] <Whirl3d__> it works like this switch class a to class b  if class a doesn't exist, stop don't do anything
[00:07:21] <tw2113> got a fiddle so i can see?
[00:07:36] <Whirl3d__> http://jsbin.com/uguyis/3/edit
[00:07:36] <FinalAngel> heya does anyone know how I can e.preventDefault an event and then e.unPreventDefault() it again somehow without creating a separate function or knowing what the original event did?
[00:08:03] <tw2113> doh, forgot i did it up myself
[00:09:09] <FinalAngel> I just have to restore event.originalEvent but how do I reassign it to a dom element?
[00:09:30] <Whirl3d__> FinalAngel you could set a variable somewhere and if (prev) {e.preventDefault(); prev=false;}
[00:09:42] <tw2113> i was hoping to leave "three" black, and when you click it, one turns blue or whatever. Oh well :D
[00:09:58] <Whirl3d__> tw2113, that's easy
[00:10:28] <Whirl3d__> I fixed it
[00:10:32] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: thats not the issue, I want to restore it
[00:11:03] <Whirl3d__> restore what?
[00:11:03] <hlve> How would I set multiple="multiple" on a select element using jQ?
[00:11:15] <FinalAngel> the original event, event.originalEvent
[00:11:44] <Whirl3d__> FinalAngel, I have no idea what you are asking or what you are trying to do, I'm sorry.
[00:12:07] <hlve> ^ Whirl3d__, mine was pretty staight forward. ;P
[00:12:25] <tw2113> i'm rambling like a moron
[00:12:35] <Whirl3d__> hive, try $("elem").attr("multiple","multiple");
[00:12:40] <hlve> ahh, attr.
[00:12:43] * hlve slaps self.
[00:12:44] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: when you preventDefault the originalEvent is removed (undefined), I want a timeout that rebinds it after a delay
[00:13:02] <Whirl3d__> or I guess it's better to use .prop in that case if you are using the latest jquery
[00:14:30] <miCSu> I have draggable objects in one div and they're being dropped to another div.. why can't I see the movement while dragging? it only disappears from the first div and appears at the other after the drop
[00:15:17] <Whirl3d__> FinalAngel, I'm sorry I must be retarded but that sentence isn't sinking in for me. If you preventDefault I wasn't aware that the "originalEvent" was a thing.
[00:16:15] <tw2113> i have to think jsbin is hotter than jsfiddle
[00:17:04] <Whirl3d__> var prevent=true; element.click(function ( e) {if (prevent) {e.preventDefault(); var t=setTimeout(function () {prevent=false;},2000);}} do stuff() });
[00:17:46] <Andweeeee> well i think jsfiddle is cooler than jsbin.
[00:17:50] <Andweeeee> touché.
[00:17:53] <Whirl3d__> the first time the element is clicked, it prevents default and then 2 seconds later if you click it enables it
[00:18:12] * Whirl3d__ is on the fence between jsfiddle/jsbin
[00:18:44] <Andweeeee> they should make a plugin together so we can all be friends.
[00:18:46] <Whirl3d__> if either would enable line numbers, it would tend to quickly sway my opinion, though
[00:19:01] <tw2113> a plugin for what Andweeeee ?
[00:19:47] <Andweeeee> it'd be cool to have an collaborative editor where multiple people can collaborate and see what they're all doing in real time.
[00:19:49] <Andweeeee> like.
[00:20:14] <Andweeeee> …there's a program already somewhere but i dont remember what its called.
[00:20:14] <tw2113> ah i think i know what you mean etherpad + jsfiddle mashup
[00:20:16] <Whirl3d__> like piratepad for coding. I swear piratePad used to do that
[00:20:26] <tw2113> mmm piratepad
[00:20:55] <Whirl3d__> google ate etherpad
[00:21:18] <Andweeeee> no idea what those are, but point being- plugin: 5 people. 1 project. same time. the chaos that would cause.
[00:21:21] <tw2113> but the concept is there
[00:21:28] <Andweeeee> wworlds would crumble.
[00:21:31] <Andweeeee> yeah but like
[00:21:36] <Andweeeee> turn it into a videogame.
[00:21:44] <tw2113> http://piratepad.net/QUJOY1JqPH
[00:22:11] <Whirl3d__> Andweeeee, maybe rather than just blathering on, you could check them out. You might have a canniption, though so be careful.
[00:24:09] <Andweeeee> my bad.
[00:26:22] <tw2113> dang, that's kind of hot...remote editing
[00:26:32] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/ovacix/3
[00:26:41] <tw2113> watch the word "hello" in red
[00:26:58] <Andweeeee> whoa.
[00:27:04] <Andweeeee> dude we live in the future.
[00:27:32] <tw2113> i've known for awhile it's awesome to be a web developer right now
[00:28:31] <Whirl3d__> so changes are live then?
[00:28:35] <Andweeeee> It's times like these I wish I had gone to school for something useful rather than static visual design.
[00:29:00] <Andweeeee> seems like it
[00:29:13] <tw2113> not perfect, but yes
[00:29:28] <tw2113> visual design is still important
[00:29:49] <tw2113> i remember being worried that i chose unwisely to go into web anything, back in the day
[00:30:06] <Whirl3d__> almost anyone can learn to code to some extent, but learning to create visually appealing content is not something you can pick up easily.
[00:30:31] <tw2113> Whirl3d__ you should know by now that not everyone can code well :P
[00:30:37] <tw2113> or are at least just starting :D
[00:30:40] <Whirl3d__> trust me.
[00:30:47] <Andweeeee> i feel better
[00:30:55] <tw2113> i suck at design
[00:31:01] <Whirl3d__> and most designer's code is as ugly as most coder's design
[00:31:04] <tw2113> i leave that to the designers
[00:31:11] <Andweeeee> lol
[00:31:35] <tw2113> developers trying to design http://www.inwebson.com/demo/hover-effects-with-css3-animations/#mainholder
[00:32:27] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: http://jsfiddle.net/Hs5Dx/ here a better example, this will not work if click is triggered programmatically (which will be the normal click event on an anchor)
[00:32:34] <Andweeeee> lol. that is a lot of…that's a lot.
[00:33:41] <tw2113> it's like a dev opened up photoshop and found the image effects area
[00:33:58] <Andweeeee> yeah i didnt want to say anything.
[00:34:27] <Andweeeee> it's very uhh…trojan smiley face esque.
[00:34:27] <tw2113> wimp
[00:34:34] <Andweeeee> lol
[00:35:59] <Whirl3d__> but what is the default behavior you are trying to prevent?
[00:36:51] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: the click or submit event (standard browser behavior) but do trigger it after some delay and logic
[00:38:06] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: I do not want to write "window.location.href = ..." again, just trigger the native event thats already there but prevented the first time (through ...trigger('click')) which seems to be almost impossible
[00:44:29] <Whirl3d__> doesn't make any sense to me, though now I see what you are saying.
[00:44:51] <Whirl3d__> whether I prevent default or not, I should be able to trigger the event again from inside itself
[00:45:17] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: sadly not via .trigger()...
[00:47:18] <Whirl3d__> but that's not preentDefault causing the problem
[00:47:21] <blackspotwiggins> FinalAngel, set a data() attribute during the timeout and check for it in the handler
[00:47:26] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Hs5Dx/13/
[00:48:56] <Whirl3d__> wait, I just figured out what I was doing wrong. hold on...
[00:50:43] <FinalAngel> even trying $(e.currentTarget).unbind('click').trigger('click'); does not do it, however, if I click the second time the click event behaves normally again (of course it is dispatched by the unbind but ignored by trigger...)
[00:51:38] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Hs5Dx/19/
[00:52:52] <Whirl3d__> I can get the second click to happen finally, but it doesn't scroll the content like it should. weird
[00:54:36] <Whirl3d__> shoky, you still around? Any insight?
[00:55:23] <Eising> hey there. I need a good (or at least better) idea. I have a page with a <select>. Each option there has a corresponding <div> that I use jquery to .show() and .hide() the rest. This gets rather impractical as I add options. Can anyone help me with a more elegant solution?
[00:56:24] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d__, jut set the location hash manually?
[00:58:06] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: did you test it in firefox? the normal click event is not fired there :D
[00:58:11] <Whirl3d__> blackspotwiggins, I was trying to help FinalAngel....but I think the problem is bigger than just anchor elements. It's form submission, etc. Anywhere you expect to get a default behavior...
[00:58:55] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d__, nah your thing is anchor specific
[00:59:16] <blackspotwiggins> the form thing works fine, ive done it
[01:00:08] <FinalAngel> just run $('a').eq(0).trigger('click'); does not work at all :D
[01:00:10] <Whirl3d__> seriously? Well still can you explain why? I don't understand why I can't trigger the default behaviour?
[01:02:06] <FinalAngel> trigger events programmativally: "You cannot do that in all browsers, supposedly IE does allow it, but Mozilla and Opera do not."
[01:02:23] <blackspotwiggins> ehh
[01:02:30] <blackspotwiggins> ofc you can
[01:03:34] <FinalAngel> it does work however if i do it like that: $('a').eq(0)[0].click();
[01:03:59] <blackspotwiggins> FinalAngel, do you even know what .eq(0) and [0] do on jquery objects?
[01:04:16] <FinalAngel> yeah
[01:04:22] <blackspotwiggins> right.
[01:04:22] <hooloovoo> ...
[01:04:23] <blackspotwiggins> okay then
[01:05:23] <Whirl3d__> but where is the disconnect when between $('a')[0].click()     and $("a").[0][0].click()
[01:05:41] <Whirl3d__> sry
[01:06:03] <Whirl3d__> I meant $("a").eq(0)[0].click();
[01:06:22] <Whirl3d__> how about this: $("a").first().click() and $("a").first()[0].click()
[01:06:31] <Whirl3d__> that's easier to read at least
[01:06:43] <FinalAngel> true
[01:06:52] <blackspotwiggins> [0] gets the first element as well
[01:07:06] <blackspotwiggins> the difference is, eq(0) and first() return jquery objects, [0] is plain dom
[01:07:12] <blackspotwiggins> but you already knew that
[01:07:23] <blackspotwiggins> so your questions must be of rhetorical nature
[01:07:34] <Whirl3d__> how about the 50th one
[01:07:42] <FinalAngel> blackspotwiggins: true, where [0] triggeres the native click event that jquerys click does not
[01:08:14] <Whirl3d__> $("a").eq(50)[0].click()     triggers the default behavior
[01:08:40] <blackspotwiggins> why not [50] ?
[01:08:41] <Whirl3d__> $("a").eq(50).click() triggers the jquery click handler
[01:09:34] <Whirl3d__> I gues you either refuse to answer the quesiton or you don't understand what I am asking.
[01:10:25] <Whirl3d__> I'm not worried about selecting the jquery element or the dom element, I'm worried about triggering the jquery handler or the native handler
[01:10:55] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d__, http://jsfiddle.net/G5DUt/
[01:11:18] <blackspotwiggins> both trigger jquery handlers
[01:12:11] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d__, http://jsfiddle.net/G5DUt/1/
[01:12:14] <blackspotwiggins> and both trigger native events
[01:12:49] <Whirl3d__> in your click handler, I want to prevent the defaultbehavior and wait for 3 seconds, then fire the event again (without preventing the default behavior)
[01:13:10] <FinalAngel> blackspotwiggins: sadly jsfiddle cant show you the click event itself (redirecting to another url)
[01:15:13] <Whirl3d__> So I can get it to prevent the default behavior and even fire the event after a delay, but I can't get it to perform it's default behavior after the delay...
[01:16:27] <Whirl3d__> blackspotwiggins, what you said about it being only anchor elements would be great, I was just hoping to understand why
[01:16:47] <blackspotwiggins> i meant the hash navigation tbh
[01:19:23] <FinalAngel> blackspotwiggins: http://jsfiddle.net/Hs5Dx/23/
[01:20:11] <FinalAngel> blackspotwiggins: there you have a good example where the normal jquery click method fires only the console log (twice by clicking) and the native click the normal click event plus twice the console log
[01:20:28] <FinalAngel> my question there is why?
[01:21:04] <FinalAngel> same goes for buttons
[01:22:56] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__: thank you for your help :)
[01:24:30] <Whirl3d__> unfortunately, I'm afraid I got us sidetracked by making it look like I didn't know the difference between a jquery object and it's dom element because I was paying attention to that part of the issue. LOL
[01:24:45] <FinalAngel> :D
[01:25:28] <Whirl3d__> All I can figure is that jquery is creating closures when it binds handlers, maybe?
[01:25:46] <FinalAngel> yeah will probably check out the source later
[01:26:09] <miCSu> is the only possibility on ui draggable elements to actually see the dragging to either use ie quirks mode or to use absolute positioning? I'd like to drag&drop rows from a table so it's bit of a problem with position: absolute if set to trs
[01:28:33] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Hs5Dx/25/
[01:28:50] <Whirl3d__> FinalAngel, it works the way you want, I think
[01:30:19] <Whirl3d__> which is weird because elem.click() doesn't work.
[01:30:20] <Nancy2012> Good Morning all
[01:30:28] <Whirl3d__> GoodMorning
[01:30:58] <Nancy2012> Since yesterday, I am trying to fix a very simple bug but the problem is that still having the same problem which seems hard to fix…
[01:31:09] <Whirl3d__> lol
[01:31:29] <Whirl3d__> can you tell us the problem?
[01:31:31] <Whirl3d__> lol
[01:31:37] <Nancy2012> actually, i m using jquery tab system and inside the tab system, I am introducing the map
[01:31:41] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/51/
[01:31:45] <Nancy2012> see the code here...
[01:32:20] <Whirl3d__> Are you familiar with developer tools in Chrome?
[01:32:26] <Whirl3d__> or Firebug in Firefox?
[01:32:30] <Nancy2012> yes
[01:32:32] <Nancy2012> i am
[01:32:48] <Whirl3d__> Then I assume you are aware of the error
[01:33:00] <Nancy2012> i have checked it  on the firebug console
[01:33:06] <Nancy2012> there is no error at all...
[01:33:16] <Nancy2012> actually, the problem is very simple…
[01:33:43] <Nancy2012> this tab system wouldn't allow any extra div inside the main div…
[01:34:17] <Nancy2012> do u know what happens inside the rendered code…. it disable the div map...
[01:34:35] <Nancy2012> like others tabs item
[01:35:03] <Nancy2012> the wizard_tab get the map div as a new tab
[01:35:09] <Nancy2012> so it wouldn't work
[01:35:18] <Nancy2012> may anyone please help me out…
[01:35:38] <Whirl3d__> just fyi, I get the error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <  when I look in the console. Second, when setting up a fiddle, if you have external resources you need to load, add them under "addResources" not in the js panel.
[01:35:55] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/VXZYA/62/
[01:35:58] <Nancy2012> but whenever i put or place the map div out of tab div… everything works
[01:36:02] <Whirl3d__> still getting errors in the code
[01:36:44] <Nancy2012> that error doesn't related with my problem...
[01:37:07] <Nancy2012> actually, ignore that error ...
[01:38:14] <Nancy2012> i am using external resources under the "addresources"
[01:38:29] <Whirl3d__> I don't know what you mean by the "wizard tab"
[01:39:35] <Nancy2012> can you see now...
[01:39:36] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/63/
[01:39:44] <FinalAngel> Whirl3d__:  yep got it to work here: to: http://jsfiddle.net/Hs5Dx/24/ (just to show that the normal jquery click does not work)
[01:39:45] <Nancy2012> i fixed few errors
[01:40:00] <Nancy2012> but the problem is that … map div wouldn't work
[01:40:28] <Whirl3d__> Nancy, I don't see any tabs
[01:40:38] <Nancy2012> there are 2 tabs
[01:40:42] <Nancy2012> can't you see
[01:41:10] <Nancy2012> personal details and address details
[01:41:25] <Whirl3d__> I see the bullet list. not tabs
[01:41:25] <Nancy2012> inside the address details … i have added the map div
[01:41:36] <Flo0815> hey guys. problem: $('#el').css('zIndex', '1'); works on event 'click' but not if it's in a setInterval-function. why?
[01:41:55] <Nancy2012> actually, what i said… i just added this to make everything simple for testing
[01:42:06] <Nancy2012> i didn't introduce css
[01:42:08] <FinalAngel> Flo0815: can u send us the code via jsfiddle? it should normally work
[01:42:16] <Nancy2012> but tab system works
[01:42:19] <Flo0815> FinalAngel: sec
[01:42:32] <Nancy2012> when you click on the another link… it loads contents
[01:42:58] <Nancy2012> only problem is that … I WANT TO LOAD MAP DIV INSIDE THE TAB DIV
[01:43:22] <Whirl3d__> Nancy2012, it's not working for me at all. Perhaps someone else will have better luck helping you with this. I keep getting errors like google is not defined or unexpected end.
[01:44:40] <FinalAngel> Nancy2012: also getting errors: ReferenceError: google is not defined
[01:44:53] <Nancy2012> wait.. i am fixing it
[01:45:40] <Whirl3d__> and what you want to do and the limitations of what you want to do are documented all over. It's a known issue that there are some weird things with tabs and Google maps. Look on StackOverflow. there are dozens of articles about ti.
[01:45:46] <Whirl3d__> *it
[01:47:55] <Flo0815> FinalAngel: nvm, i've got it. thx!
[01:49:46] <lvh> Hi
[01:50:05] <lvh> I'm trying to do a file upload in a single page app. There appear to be a gazillion plugins for doing so.
[01:50:14] <lvh> 1) What do they get me over posting in an iframe?
[01:50:32] <lvh> 2) Why does Jquery-File-Upload insist on me responding some JSON for file uploads?
[01:51:36] <NodeX> 42
[01:53:20] <FinalAngel> Flo0815: np :D
[02:01:21] <Kingsy> what is the benefit of putting something inside a function like this --> jQuery(function(){ jQuery("#outerImageContainer").anythingZoomer(); });    <--
[02:01:27] <Kingsy> I see it all the time and I am not sure why
[02:06:05] <Pitel_laptop> is it possible to get source code from completely different web page and bypass same-origin-policy somehow?
[02:07:10] <Whirl3d__> Kingsy, if your javascript is included in the head element of your document, when you try to select other elements using jQuery, they may not have been created yet. By wrapping your code in a jquery function, you ensure that the page is loaded and that all of your elements exist before trying to select against them.
[02:07:50] <Whirl3d__> I'm pretty sure it's the same as putting things in $(document).ready(function () { });
[02:07:54] <Whirl3d__> just a shortcut
[02:10:03] <Kingsy> Whirl3d__: so functions are executed last ?
[02:11:53] <Whirl3d__> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[02:27:18] <eshlox> $("span.countdown").text(s + ' seconds'); when i run this (setInterval) in IE then span is changed onl if i move mouse, ideas?
[02:28:05] <NodeX> err it's bound to a mousemove lol
[02:28:52] <eshlox> no? ;-p
[02:33:08] <NodeX> it must be else it wouldn't do it
[02:34:45] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/797295/ full code
[02:35:10] <eshlox> it works in ff, chrome, etc but not in IE ;-S
[02:35:32] <eshlox> .empty().append(), .html(), .text(), still this same problem
[02:37:18] <NodeX> which IE version?
[02:39:39] <eshlox> NodeX: 8.0
[02:42:03] <NodeX> something else in your code must be messing with it. it works fine for me
[02:43:13] <Depth> hey
[02:43:32] <Depth> I've tried to add a range slider and it works fine - one time!
[02:43:46] <Depth> then he says TypeError: k is not a function
[02:44:12] <Depth> this declaration k is in jqueryui .. how do I correct it?
[02:46:22] <blackspotwiggins> Depth, check http://fixingthesejquery.com/ , if nothing else then http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide47
[02:50:15] <eshlox> NodeX: weird, i removed all js scripts without this and still this same ;-/
[02:50:54] <NodeX> what version of jquery?>

[02:53:48] <Depth> @blackspotwiggins: thx :D
[02:54:01] <Depth> the line garbage in, garbage out was very helpful xD
[02:54:22] <Depth> as well as: why didn't someone else notice that
[02:54:24] <Depth> bye :)
[02:59:47] <sunbeam> how can i check if #user has z-index: 5 with jquery?
[03:02:53] <NodeX> if(parseInt($("#user").css('z-index'),10)==5) { ...
[03:04:09] <sunbeam> parseInt?
[03:04:15] <sunbeam> anyway ill look itup, thanks
[03:11:09] <sunbeam> another question, i have a function, that does this: $("#slide .next").click(function() { return false; }
[03:11:24] <sunbeam> however when that .next is clicked first another event seem to be fired (sliding to the next slide)
[03:11:30] <sunbeam> is there any way i can prevant this?
[03:13:10] <techouse> so i made an each loop around some audio players. now if one ends i get a callback function; what interests me is how to jump to the next element of the each loop to tell it to execute my play function?
[03:13:24] <faraway> sunbeam: function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }  probably will help already
[03:15:01] <sunbeam> faraway: ok, how do I know what event is?
[03:15:01] <faraway> sunbeam: is the #slide.next a "a"-tag with an href ?
[03:15:12] <sunbeam> $slide a.next yes
[03:15:15] <sunbeam> #slide a.next yes
[03:15:54] <faraway> sunbeam: the event is passed by jquery as first argument to your callback function
[03:17:27] <sunbeam> $("#slide a.next").click(function(event) {event.preventDefault();});
[03:17:28] <sunbeam> this?
[03:17:51] <faraway> sunbeam: i know that with standard event handling there is a "return false", to prevent the default browser behavior but not sure if this standard and if it will work with jquery, so i would suggest to use the jquery way
[03:17:57] <faraway> sunbeam: yes
[03:19:13] <faraway> sunbeam: if the element with the element with the class "next" is an "a" tag
[03:19:59] <sunbeam> i tried this, but doesn't work
[03:20:04] <sunbeam> it opens the next slide
[03:20:42] <faraway> sunbeam: could you post a small code sample http://jsfiddle.net/ that shows the problem
[03:22:00] <sunbeam> yes, but i dont know how i can include the slidejs
[03:23:06] <faraway> sunbeam: ah ok, now i probably know what the problem could be, the slidjs also listens to clicks on the "#slide .next" and you would like to prevent loading of the next slide .. right ?
[03:23:35] <sunbeam> yes
[03:24:23] <faraway> so you need to add the listening to the "#slide a.next" before slidejs does and need to use event.stopPropagation()
[03:25:12] <faraway> but i think slidjs creates the elements
[03:25:39] <Kennythehitman> Hey, does anyone have any clue why Python doesnt think [] is an empty list? http://dpaste.org/6omI4/
[03:25:57] <sunbeam> yes it does
[03:25:59] <sunbeam> indeed
[03:26:40] <Kennythehitman> I go through the same method of popping an int list with the interpreter, and it knows [] is an empty list when no integers are left..
[03:26:54] <Kennythehitman> It's driving me insane that it's not working in the above code
[03:26:59] <Kennythehitman> Any help would be greatly appreciated
[03:31:33] <sunbeam> faraway: how can i add listening to slide a.next? or doesn't this make any sense
[03:31:37] <faraway> sunbeam: hmm,  cause the callbacks are called in the order they are registrated you have a problem, i think you cannot solve it without making a patch in the sliders .. sorry .. probably i'm wrong, cause i i only had a short look in the docs of sliderjs
[03:32:27] <davetarmac> Morning
[03:32:46] <sunbeam> faraway: ok, a patch like? in which slider function
[03:32:48] <faraway> sunbeam: you do $("#slide").sliderjs()   right ?
[03:33:52] <davetarmac> I'm trying to expand on what I learnt last time i was here about moving content in to a wrapper <div>, but I need to do it again, but can't figure it out. I've been trying on a jsfiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/wAL5L/) but I keep getting [object Object][object Object] returned and not sure what is going on
[03:34:15] <Kennythehitman> weird :/ I fixed it by using del instead of pop()
[03:34:30] <davetarmac> I'm trying to get two <div>s moved in to a wrapper <div> so I can put them in some tabs
[03:35:09] <sunbeam> faraway: jQuery("#slide").slides({ // options });
[03:35:37] <quicksilver> davetarmac: you don't move convent by turning it into strings and combining it with +
[03:35:41] <quicksilver> davetarmac: content, I mean.
[03:36:06] <quicksilver> davetarmac: you could do somethign more useful with + boxRelated.html() + boxUpsell.html() but that wouldn't move it, it would duplicated it.
[03:36:11] <faraway> sunbeam: try this one : add jQuery("#slide").on("click",".next", function(event){ event.preventDefault() );   before you do the jQuery("#slide").slides({});   probably this will work.
[03:36:30] <Kennythehitman> ffffffffffffffffffff I just realized im in the wrong chan
[03:36:34] <Kennythehitman> disregard me
[03:36:52] <davetarmac> quicksilver: Ideally I need to move it, keeping the box-collateral divs intact so I can use them as separate tabs
[03:37:47] <sunbeam> faraway: tried, but same
[03:38:03] <davetarmac> quicksilver: tried it with .html() on the end of my vars, but it overwrites the .keep-me-here div
[03:38:04] <faraway> sunbeam: sorry, then i can't help you :/
[03:38:22] <sunbeam> ok
[03:38:25] <quicksilver> davetarmac: try this : http://jsfiddle.net/wAL5L/1/
[03:40:35] <davetarmac> you're a gentleman and a scholar, quicksilver
[03:40:44] <davetarmac> I wasn't too far off - yet miles off!
[03:41:10] <quicksilver> davetarmac: using .html() replaces all content, as you noted.
[03:41:19] <quicksilver> davetarmac: append and prepend better for what you're trying to do.
[03:41:26] <quicksilver> (you also had a couple of typos I fixed)
[03:41:39] <davetarmac> which probably didn't help - thanks quicksilver
[03:42:11] <davetarmac> and it works beautifully in situ
[03:42:16] <davetarmac> massive thanks
[03:44:19] <faraway> sunbeam: look in the source (not the minified) for the "// generate next/prev buttons"  before the "// next button" there you could insert you patch code, with the preventDefault
[03:45:24] <faraway> sunbeam: it is not a nice solution, but a quick fix, until you find a better solution
[03:45:46] <faraway> sunbeam: probably you could combine it with an extension of the options
[03:54:25] <sunbeam> faraway: if (option.generateNextPrev) {
[03:54:26] <sunbeam> this?
[03:55:37] <faraway> sunbeam: yes … at this part.
[03:55:53] <sunbeam> faraway: but what should i put in there?
[03:56:02] <sunbeam> i cannot prevent the items being created
[03:58:02] <hoolter> Hi... if I serve a script from my server, can i set a third party cookie for the script?
[03:59:25] <faraway> sunbeam: you don't want to have the next prev buttons ?
[04:00:28] <sunbeam> no i need them
[04:00:39] <faraway> http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9NLB2/
[04:01:24] <faraway> sunbeam: i haven't tested it, but it should work
[04:01:54] <faraway> sunbeam: anyway … i now need to do some other stuff, thats all help i could provide
[04:02:01] <sunbeam> thanks a lot, i will try this
[04:03:06] <tocka> morning guys
[04:03:59] <tocka> I have this piece of code, it calculates the price for the product according to what kind of options you select, but how could I change it that it would count price for 5 products seperately and these products are on the same page
[04:04:01] <tocka> any advice ?
[04:04:02] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/X8tYX/
[04:06:53] <faraway> tocka: e.g. use a class for each product/group of products you want to calculate seperately and include this class to you selector
[04:08:13] <wathek> Hi everybody
[04:08:37] <hoolter> how can i initialize a global variable from within a function?
[04:08:44] <wathek> is it possible using jquery to append value to one CSS property ? append value and remove what was appended
[04:10:05] <tocka> faraway but I will have to copy that script X more times then
[04:11:15] <faraway> tocka: us a function parameter function calcTotal(className) {....}   calcTotal("product1")  calcTotal("product2") ….
[04:11:17] <sunbeam> faraway: if you have time, is there an alternative to stopPropagation or preventDefault?
[04:11:26] <tocka> faraway thanks
[04:11:34] <tocka> Im just going to use form ID's
[04:12:03] <faraway> hoolter: search for javascript scopes and the meaning of "var" statements
[04:12:28] <sente> how can i filter $('img') and keep only images with a style('width') > 300px,
[04:12:32] <faraway> tocka: just was a hint how you could do it
[04:12:34] <sente> and/or another artbirary filter
[04:12:38] <sente> which i can take and run with
[04:13:47] <faraway> sunbeam: whats the problem about preventDefault ?
[04:13:59] <faraway> sunbeam: and stopPropagation ?
[04:15:28] <faraway> sente: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[04:16:26] <sente> faraway: thanks
[04:17:09] <sunbeam> faraway: they don't work on this
[04:17:35] <sunbeam> i added if (option.nextCallback) { $('.' + option.next, elem).click(option.nextCallback);}
[04:17:39] <godlfishh> hey I want to make a convert a percent number to color, and have the color go around the color wheel
[04:17:47] <godlfishh> where should i go to figure this out, i have no clue wher to start
[04:18:03] <godlfishh> like, 0% would be red, and 50% would be half way around color wheel at constant hue
[04:18:06] <godlfishh> something like that
[04:18:36] <faraway> sunbeam: and did you use the nextCallback  with you options as described at usage ?
[04:19:11] <repair> how can i set the background image of <li> when an href is clicked <li><a href='page1.html'>P1</a>
[04:19:26] <sunbeam> faraway: yes exactly
[04:19:42] <sacho> godlfishh, you mean at constant saturation?
[04:20:03] <sacho> at any rate, define what your percentages mean first.
[04:20:24] <tocka> faraway you were having in mind something like this right ? http://jsfiddle.net/X8tYX/1/
[04:20:33] <faraway> sunbeam: sorry, that was all i could do next to my employment
[04:20:57] <repair> problem is that when href is clicked it goes to that page so $(this).css wont work
[04:21:03] <sunbeam> faraway: ok no problem, thanks anwyay
[04:21:24] <repair> any idea?
[04:22:20] <faraway> tocka: yes probably you need add the "formID +"  at other parts of the selectors to .. but thats the thing i had in mind
[04:22:30] <tocka> Alright :)

[04:54:24] <jeffsmykil> How do you get just the ID of an onClick event?
[04:54:38] <jeffsmykil> e.target gives me the whole <div id="foo"></div>

[04:55:34] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, this.id?
[04:55:54] <jeffsmykil> e.target.id im a moron
[04:56:01] <jeffsmykil> sorry figured it out right when i asked
[04:56:07] <quicksilver> it did seem like an odd question :)

[04:59:57] <hoolter> Hi, let's say I have an html document and at some arbitrary point in the body, there's a script element.  inside of this script element is some code that creates a new script element, sets it's @src, and then does a document.body.appendChild(newScriptEl);. will this wait for the rest of the statically-marked-up body to load, and then execute the script? or will it just tack it onto the end of the portion of the DOM that's already bee

[05:09:44] <GhostBear> Hello. I want to walk through each element selected by selector and perform certain action on it, what's the best way to do it?
[05:10:00] <GhostBear> I've tried $(...).each(function(){}); but it doesn't seem to work
[05:11:06] <miCSu> GhostBear: how're u using selector?
[05:11:19] <GhostBear> $('.class').
[05:11:56] <miCSu> that should work if the class's defined to some elements
[05:11:57] <quicksilver> GhostBear: yes, .each is the right way to do that.
[05:12:07] <quicksilver> in what way is not seem seeming to work for you?
[05:13:12] <GhostBear> Alright, it seems that I have found a problem, it wasn't related to improper use of each. I decided to ask for help since it looks like each() documentation refers only to using each to walk through arrays and not elements returned by selector
[05:13:14] <GhostBear> Thanks for help
[05:13:58] <quicksilver> GhostBear: you might have been reading the wrong docs
[05:14:09] <quicksilver> ( http://api.jquery.com/each/ vs http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ )
[05:14:18] <quicksilver> the former is for selectors, the latter is for any array.
[05:14:18] <NodeX> can someone help me install jquery on my windows 98 machine thank you please
[05:14:31] <quicksilver> but jquery objects behave a lot like arrays.
[05:15:57] <miCSu> NodeX: how were u planning on using it?
[05:21:08] <gabriel1> guys
[05:21:42] <gabriel1> I have a select with, let's say, 5 options. I want to sort these options by a custom attribute
[05:22:06] <gabriel1> how can I do this?
[05:22:26] <NodeX> miCSu : in my website
[05:22:45] <tocka> gabriel1
[05:22:45] <tocka> http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/05/jquery-filter-sort-plugins.html
[05:23:05] <miCSu> NodeX: just add the tag <script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script> inside the website's head
[05:23:37] <NodeX> what about to do install on my windows 98 machine for work to make it?
[05:24:19] <gabriel1> tocka, thanks, will check it out!
[05:24:20] <gabriel1> cheers
[05:24:23] <miCSu> u could download the latest jquery locally and change the src to it
[05:24:39] <NodeX> and that make it will work on my laptop also?
[05:25:39] <miCSu> NodeX: if u want to use it on your website, u could either download it to the server running websites or just use directly the url specified above if it's always online
[05:26:06] <NodeX> thanks, you have been most helpful, 1000 thankyou's
[05:26:23] <pachet> windows 98!
[05:26:23] <NodeX> may god bless your goat in the next life
[05:27:17] <tocka> maybe anyone has an idea why its not adding up the sum total "total" ? http://jsfiddle.net/X8tYX/5/
[05:28:37] <NodeX> tocka, try wrapping it in $(document).ready(); incase it's because it's not rendered before the JS is executed
[05:29:43] <tocka> NodeX the thing is jQuery works fine
[05:29:51] <tocka> its just not adding it up to the total sum
[05:31:15] <Lucky--> very stupid easy question, but i always tend to forget when doing a margin/padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px vs margin-left margin-right, etc what order is it? top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right?
[05:31:18] <slikts> what's the groupthink on jquery mvc frameworks?
[05:31:31] <slikts> Lucky--: it's the same as on clocks
[05:31:34] <slikts> starting at 12
[05:31:50] <Lucky--> slikts: thanks, ill be able to remember that
[05:31:51] <Lucky--> :-)
[05:31:53] <NodeX> top,left,bottom,right iirc
[05:32:39] <slikts> rong
[05:34:38] <quicksilver> tocka: several mistakes. Try this : http://jsfiddle.net/X8tYX/11/
[05:35:37] <quicksilver> tocka: the mistakes were : (1) formID parameter on calcTotal() wasn't passed, I just removed the parameter since it can access the outer variable. (2) important space before "select" in the selector on $(formID +" select option:selected") (3) inside the each you want to use $(this) to refer to the current element.
[05:36:59] <tocka> quicksilver thank you <3
[05:43:55] <Depth> I want to get the values of a range slider .. but what is index? .slider( "values" , index , [value] )
[05:46:59] <tocka> quicksilver maybe you are still here?
[05:47:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone familiar with JQuery UI?
[05:47:20] <tocka> I edited the script but still, nothing is being added to var total
[05:47:49] <quicksilver> tocka: the version I pasted worked at startup.
[05:48:03] <quicksilver> it didn't work when you reselected from the drop-downs but I couldn't be bothered to fix that
[05:48:11] <quicksilver> I hoped I had already given enoughc lues.
[05:56:57] <tocka> quicksilver its just strange that calcTotal() is getting the formID, lets say when I print it out from inside the function, its there
[05:58:08] <quicksilver> how is that strange?
[05:58:16] <quicksilver> formID in visble from the enclosing scope
[05:58:31] <tocka> right, ok then, thanks again
[06:06:53] <bnovc> is there any way in jQuery or normal JS that I can get a notification when a variable is garbage collected? I am doing some IPC from C++ <-> JS, and I would like to be able to know when the JS objects are no longer referenced, so they can be freed on the native side
[06:06:57] <wathek> is it possible using jquery to append value to one CSS property ? append value and remove what was appended. for example the property -webkit-transform I can have an element that has that property's value set to rotate(-15deg) and I want to add to that property scaleX(-1)
[06:08:05] <faraway> wathek: depends on the property: e.g. border can be change at once, or just portions with border-color border-size ….
[06:08:32] <wathek> faraway, yes I'm having problem with the transform properties
[06:08:33] <faraway> wathek: that is less a query feature then a css feature
[06:09:42] <wathek> I guess I need to write some piece of code to do that
[06:11:42] <faraway> wathek: i think for the transforms you need to do this .. but isn't there a plugin for query for css transformations ? i currently don't know but i thought i have seen one once
[06:13:00] <wathek> faraway, ok thanks
[06:16:22] <pachet> bnovc: shy of compiling your own hacked up version of one of the open source implementations, no
[06:17:43] <M1k1> hi please
[06:17:50] <M1k1> jquery development status link url?
[06:17:52] <surial> I'm using jqueryUI's draggable/droppable system. I have a simple helpdesk thing going and I want the ability to drag tickets into different priority 'containers'.  I've got 'revert' on for everything, and if you drop a ticket on a valid 'box', it will rehome (.appendTo) the ticket div. Revert works fine, except the point from which the ticket will animate-fly back to its new home is wrong.
[06:18:13] <surial> Am I making any sense? I could NOT revert on a valid drop target but then the ticket is whereever you left it; I want it to fly back to a properly outlined space.
[06:18:34] <pachet> ?g jquery development status @ M1k1
[06:18:38] <surial> Is there anyway I can animate-move an item that has been explicitly positioned due to draggable to its normal location?
[06:18:52] * pachet has a whole in his heart in the shape of bot-t
[06:19:01] * pachet a whole hole
[06:19:04] <M1k1> pachet: next release status?
[06:19:24] <surial> i.e. can I animate-move a position: relative or position: absolute item to position: static?
[06:20:01] <sacho> hmm
[06:20:21] <sacho> you would have to find the positioning of the elements around the positioned item
[06:20:34] <sacho> then animate moving towards that positioning while relative/absolute
[06:20:36] <sacho> then go static
[06:21:04] <surial> Draggable is actually managing that.
[06:21:08] <sacho> that would work for relative
[06:22:02] <surial> Draggable (with revert on in all situations) is actually managing to do this, but the only mistake it makes is that when I move the item's actual DOM location (by appendToing it to a different container div), the div I'm dragging instantly moves to a different location, and then animate-moves from there to its appropriate location. I want exactly this behaviour, except without the jump-to-random-location bug.
[06:23:01] <sacho> hmm
[06:23:31] <sacho> well, I don't know what draggable does under the hood
[06:23:34] <surial> as far as I know draggable works by switching position to relative and then modifying left/top. These are then animated towards 0/0 at which point the animation ends by resetting position back to whatever it was, I guess. So… when the ticket is accepted, I need to take its current position, then rehome it, then take whatever it is at now and change top/left to reflect this. If I do this all in one block of JS, does that cause screen
[06:23:34] <surial> flickering?
[06:23:47] <surial> Sorry, answering my own question here. I should have talked to the bear first.
[06:24:31] <bnovc> pachet: open source implementations meaning the browser in question? I was planning to make a browser plugin if not possible probably
[06:25:22] <sunbeam> if(parseInt($(".slide-2").css('z-index'),10)==5) {}
[06:25:34] <sunbeam> is this the fastest way to check whether this div.slide-2 has z-index 5?
[06:26:03] <NodeX> yes
[06:26:11] <NodeX> else I would not have wrote it that way
[06:26:39] <pachet> bnovc: yeah, the browser. i'd recommend looking at the v8 source, if you're coming from c++ you should be able to navigate the base just fine
[06:26:49] <NodeX> on the class it has to be ... $('.class:first').css(...
[06:27:09] <sunbeam> NodeX: ok
[06:27:13] <M1k1> guys 1.8 status in development url please?
[06:27:23] <bnovc> pachet: this won't be running on a browser using v8, but ya, it should be plenty feasible. Just wanting to make sure I wasn't missing something first
[06:32:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know if it's possible to pass certain "arguments" to an html tag? These arguments should not be visible initially, but I need to retrieve them within a JS file to dynamically populate certain form fields when the form turns visible
[06:32:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> (without using fake attributes)
[06:33:08] <NodeX> eh?
[06:33:38] <NodeX> the actual <html> tag do you mean?
[06:33:50] <NodeX> or any tag
[06:34:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> e
[06:34:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[06:34:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> TDs in this case
[06:35:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm using jquery dialogs with forms in them... I need to prepopulate those with the arguments when a user clicks to open a dialog
[06:36:07] <faraway> ecky--ptang-zoob: what do you mean with not visible ?
[06:36:11] <NodeX> <td data-arguments="{foo:'bar'}">Bleh</td> ... $("your-td").data('arguments');
[06:36:27] <NodeX> that will return {foo:'bar'} as a string
[06:36:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> NodeX: won't the browser get confused by that?
[06:37:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> faraway: only visible in the code, not on display
[06:37:10] <NodeX> ecky--ptang-zoob : no
[06:37:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, i'll look into that, thx
[06:37:26] <faraway> ecky--ptang-zoob: then the way NodeX said is the way to do it
[06:37:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> kk
[06:38:07] <NodeX> data-* is the accepted cross browser format
[06:38:20] <NodeX> where * is your Non spaced name of the data block
[06:38:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> something else: is there a recommended color picker for jquery? I see there are quite a few plugins
[06:39:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need one that's linked to a form field and puts the hex code of the clicked color in the form field
[06:39:38] <faraway> if you want to confuse IE just place a <span/> in your code :D
[06:39:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> lol
[06:40:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what happens then? :p
[06:41:15] <faraway> really strange things … sometimes complete layout failures and bad rendering bugs .. not al the time, but i was able to track it down to a <span/>  if i replaced it with <span></span> everything worked again :D
[06:41:57] <faraway> it just cam back to my mind cause i used a <span data-…. />  for storing infos :D
[06:41:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hehe, only with IE
[06:42:20] <faraway> jep only with ie i think it was ie 7 but not sure anymore
[06:44:12] <gabriel1> weird question but what network are we in?
[06:44:18] <gabriel1> IRC network, freenode?
[06:44:55] <seutje> yesh
[06:45:17] <gabriel1> thanks, my client are a bit.... old
[06:45:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> for some reason the jquery ui color picker is not on the site anymore... anyone knows what happened to it?
[06:46:30] <sunbeam> any idea how I can check whether there is any with class .slide inside #slides that has z-index: 5 ?
[06:48:31] <NodeX> you have to each them sunbeam
[06:49:36] <sunbeam> ok
[06:50:35] <sunbeam> NodeX: how can i put all #slides .slide in an array?
[06:51:30] <NodeX> $("#slides .slide");
[06:51:44] <sunbeam> var slides =  $("#slides .slide");
[06:52:45] <NodeX> you want somehting like this .... function check() {  $("#slides .slide").each(function(){ if(parseInt($(this).css('z-index'),10)==5) {return $(this); } ... var hasFive=check();
[06:53:20] <NodeX> hasFive will be the first element with a z-index of 5
[06:53:55] <sunbeam> ok, and if it hasnt got any hasFive = false right?
[06:54:49] <NodeX> yeh, you can check it with size();
[06:54:54] <NodeX> or length
[06:55:07] <NodeX> if(!hasFive.length) { ...
[06:55:07] <sunbeam> ok thanks again
[06:55:51] <BinaryKitten> NodeX size is deprecated now i believe
[06:56:40] <NodeX> ?size
[06:57:25] <BinaryKitten> NodeX http://api.jquery.com/size/
[06:57:26] <blackspotwiggins> bot is ded
[06:57:38] <BinaryKitten> Categories: Deprecated | Miscellaneous > DOM Element Methods
[07:00:41] <ozyler> how can i get the size (the last index-1) of $.each(data, function(i,item)    , with size/length i only get the "1".....
[07:02:48] <sunbeam> NodeX: weird i keep getting undefined, although at least one time it is true
[07:04:23] <sunbeam> even when i replace return $(this) for return "something";
[07:05:43] <BinaryKitten> urm .each?
[07:06:25] <ozyler> what do  mean, binaryKitten?
[07:06:34] <ozyler> what do u mean..
[07:07:17] <rmill> ?api size
[07:07:17] <b-ot> rmill, .size(): Return the number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/size/
[07:07:29] <BinaryKitten> ozyler actually was referring to sunbeam
[07:07:38] <BinaryKitten> rmill it's deprecated!
[07:07:48] <BinaryKitten> use .length instead
[07:07:54] * rmill shrugs
[07:07:54] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:08:25] <BinaryKitten> the reason for the undefined is that check is not returning anything at all
[07:09:17] <NodeX> sunbeam
[07:09:18] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/x3btd/2/
[07:09:21] <BinaryKitten> var items = $("#slides .slide").filter(function(){ return (parseInt($(this).css('z-index'),10)==5); });
[07:09:42] <NodeX> or that^
[07:10:15] <BinaryKitten> .each is ok .. but no point using .each to build another array just to iterate over that
[07:10:20] <b-ot> BinaryKitten, memorised “:.each”.
[07:10:31] <NoiseEee> herp
[07:10:32] <BinaryKitten> damn b-ot
[07:10:38] <BinaryKitten> ?.each
[07:10:50] <BinaryKitten> ?lart .each
[07:10:59] <NodeX> ?filter
[07:11:02] <BinaryKitten> it's a fake bot-t
[07:11:27] <rmill> b-ot expects 'api'
[07:11:29] <BinaryKitten> ozyler  now for your issue..
[07:11:35] <rmill> ?api filter
[07:11:36] <b-ot> rmill, .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[07:11:39] <BinaryKitten> how do you mean get size?
[07:11:43] <sunbeam> NodeX: thanks again
[07:12:07] <ozyler> ok
[07:12:44] <ozyler> i will create a js fiddle
[07:12:55] <sunbeam> I keep getting undefined NodeX
[07:13:09] <sunbeam> although it should return something (the function)
[07:13:29] <NodeX> then you dont have z-index of 5 in your collection
[07:13:32] <sunbeam> when you alert(check())
[07:13:46] <NodeX> put your code on jsfiddle
[07:13:56] <NodeX> this is a mucg
[07:14:00] <sunbeam> i do have, because it triggers alert("something"); that i put before return $(this)
[07:14:10] <NodeX> much* quicker way because it uses apply  .... var items = $("#slides .slide").filter(function(){ return (parseInt($(this).css('z-index'),10)==5); }); ^^ from Binary Kitten
[07:14:11] <sunbeam> ok i think i edit the one you made, sec
[07:14:29] <sunbeam> ah nice
[07:14:37] <sunbeam> never seen .filter()
[07:14:55] <BinaryKitten> .filter takes in a selector or function
[07:15:01] <NodeX> I didn't know it could do that either
[07:15:07] <NodeX> never really used it tbh
[07:15:14] <ozyler> this code doesnt work, cause the data is missing, it's a json callback, but maybe the problem will be understodd with this code : http://jsfiddle.net/v463t/1/
[07:15:29] <BinaryKitten> if selector, only the ones that mach work.   if function any return true will be kept,
[07:15:39] <NodeX> ozyler : size() is depreciated
[07:15:43] <ozyler> i only need the maximum index/size of the iteration
[07:16:21] <NodeX> use length
[07:16:51] <BinaryKitten> ozyler: http://jsfiddle.net/v463t/2/
[07:17:15] <kreantos> hello
[07:17:25] <kreantos> does anyone of you uses jsRender?
[07:17:57] <kreantos> i would need a callback, which is triggered, whenever a template is rendered
[07:18:14] <sunbeam> whats better to use, length or size
[07:18:32] <ozyler> i put my research in this direction, thx binarykitten, maybe i'll post my success in the next minutes ;)
[07:18:39] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam length
[07:18:45] <BinaryKitten> .size just wraps that
[07:18:48] <sunbeam> ok
[07:19:04] <BinaryKitten> .size = function() { return this.length }
[07:19:09] <BinaryKitten> and is deprecated
[07:28:37] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: ok, but how does .filter() do a foreach?
[07:28:41] <sunbeam> eg. loop through all slides
[07:29:08] <BinaryKitten> it does that internally
[07:29:21] <BinaryKitten> same as .css or .click does
[07:29:39] <BinaryKitten> what you get after filter is the filtered collection
[07:30:01] <BinaryKitten> you could run .each on that .. you could just run something else on that
[07:30:08] <BinaryKitten> it's up to you
[07:34:18] <Drager> Hi, anyone know how to make a download countdown with jquery? Easy
[07:37:29] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: ok
[07:37:36] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: the result, in items var
[07:37:44] <sunbeam> any idea how i can print_r this in jquery?
[07:38:06] <sunbeam> to find out which slide class (slide-1 slide-2) etc the one with z-index: 5 has
[07:41:09] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam that's wher you would use .each
[07:41:11] <Kingsy> if I have jQuery(this).css('background-image', 'url("../../spinner.jpg")');  <-- or whatever.. how do you set values along with that? like no-repeat center center etc etc ?
[07:41:30] <Kingsy> if you just add it to the statement it just doesnt attach any image
[07:41:32] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam install firebug and use console.log
[07:42:08] <BinaryKitten> Kingsy you can't set that on a background image
[07:42:21] <Kingsy> oh yeah its background only right..
[07:42:22] <Kingsy> damn ok
[07:42:24] <BinaryKitten> Kingsy try switching background-image to background
[07:42:29] <BinaryKitten> or
[07:42:30] <Kingsy> yeah got it..
[07:42:32] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: yes, but i mean, when i use var items = $("#slides .slide").filter(function(){ return (parseInt($(this).css('z-index'),10)==5); });
[07:42:42] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: then items will contain the class names of the item right?
[07:42:47] <BinaryKitten> .css({item1: value1, item2: value2});
[07:43:03] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam no
[07:43:15] <BinaryKitten> items contains the items
[07:43:37] <BinaryKitten> it's a jQuery object sunbean
[07:43:45] <BinaryKitten> interact with it the same way
[07:43:55] <Kingsy> one other thing, the fadeTo() function seems to apply a opacity to the child elements its acting upon .. how do you stop it doing that? so the fade effect is only noticable on the background image itself..
[07:44:32] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: i know, but it will only contain the amount of classes that match this?
[07:44:58] <BinaryKitten> no, it will contain all items that have z-index of 5
[07:45:11] <BinaryKitten> there is nothing to do with classes there
[07:45:28] <BinaryKitten> Kingsy you can't
[07:45:45] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: yes but those items, have got a class?
[07:45:54] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam they could have yes
[07:46:09] <sunbeam> ok, how can i get them all ? only looping through them with .each?
[07:46:20] <BinaryKitten> get all the classes?
[07:46:27] <sunbeam> well, i only expect 1
[07:46:30] <sunbeam> 1 item
[07:46:34] <sunbeam> not more than 1
[07:46:35] <BinaryKitten> ?
[07:46:48] <sunbeam> get the class of the one that matches that z-index,y es
[07:47:01] <Kingsy> BinaryKitten: is it impossible in anyway to get ONLY the background to fade out and in and not the child elements? with any jquery method?
[07:47:16] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam "only expect" is where you're going wrong
[07:47:29] <BinaryKitten> Kingsy yes that's impossible
[07:47:37] <Kingsy> ok np thanks
[07:47:45] <BinaryKitten> Kingsy what you could do though
[07:47:57] <BinaryKitten> is have a child element sit behind them?
[07:48:04] <BinaryKitten> then fade that?
[07:48:27] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam if you're sure
[07:48:54] <BinaryKitten> then items.first().attr('class'); will get you the class attribute for it
[07:49:08] <BinaryKitten> and is safe incase there is more than 1 that matches
[07:49:43] <sunbeam> its not possible, unless the user manipulates it
[07:49:50] <sunbeam> but, there is no database or other i/o
[07:50:11] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam: never underestimate the power of people to mess with your code
[07:51:13] <BinaryKitten> if items.attr('class'); would work .. then if you're sure that you only after 1 item then items.first().attr('class') is better
[07:51:23] <Kingsy> BinaryKitten: I cant, the background I need to fade is wider than its child container.. its kinda the desgin
[07:51:26] <Kingsy> design
[07:51:48] <BinaryKitten> Kingsy how are you limiting it then?
[07:51:51] <BinaryKitten> width, height?
[07:51:59] <Buck> is it possible to (pre)load a jqGrid with json data from a server without opening it first?
[07:52:17] <BinaryKitten> having those attributes applied to a child item positioned correctly won't be any differnet
[07:52:17] <Kingsy> we support up to a max width of 2000 or something pixels.. and the height is set.. 400 pixels or so
[07:53:08] <Kingsy> yeah I think your right I need to mess with a child element with a container or some sort I guess
[07:55:02] <mister_m> if I have a td that has an onclick event for the entire td, and then an image with an onclick that lives in that td - how can I have the image onclick fire without the td's?
[07:56:54] <BinaryKitten> mister_m you can't
[07:57:06] <BinaryKitten> but you can tell the td's click to filter it out
[07:57:28] <BinaryKitten> eg if (event.target != this) { ..... }
[07:57:33] <BinaryKitten> something like that
[07:57:37] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to say: If the selected value of eq4 is NOT "None" then console.log, but it just goes wild :x http://pastie.org/4330527
[07:57:38] <mister_m> BinaryKitten: that sounds like what I want
[07:58:37] <BinaryKitten> fRAiLtY- .text('value') sets it to that value
[07:59:04] <fRAiLtY-> Ok so I need to find the text value
[07:59:15] <BinaryKitten> .text() !== 'None'
[07:59:45] <BinaryKitten> if (blah.find(blah).text() !== 'None'
[08:00:21] * BinaryKitten departs for a while
[08:03:40] <Lucky--> oh how i HATE you IE. why can't I just built one or two of the same website? Oh IE tell me why it is that I must build a site just for you and your idiot user base?
[08:04:32] <Depth> hey
[08:04:54] <Depth> I've searched several boards, but nobody seems to have a soluti
[08:04:55] <Depth> on
[08:05:25] <Depth> I have a slider (range) and need to save the actual value of them into a var
[08:05:29] <Depth> How may I do this?
[08:05:47] <HassanS> will $('input[type="checkbox"]').attr('checked')  ever return the boolean true?  Or does it always return 'checked' or 'undefined'?
[08:05:50] <Lucky--> just $("#idofslider").val();
[08:06:54] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: do you know a good way to filter the classes?
[08:07:15] <Lucky--> which site you guys like better? http://247cashnew.azurewebsites.net/ http://www.24-7cashadvance.com/ this is my first foray into really playing with css3 features.
[08:07:21] <sunbeam> eg. items.first().attr('class') = 'slide slide-3'
[08:07:29] <sunbeam> i only need the second one, non .slide
[08:07:54] <Depth> Lucky: Can I also get only the values? They are formatted at the moment, just like: 0 - 86 Euro
[08:08:00] <Depth> But I only need 0 and 86
[08:08:07] <HassanS> you could use split() then get the last index
[08:08:23] <sunbeam> HassanS: thanks
[08:08:55] <Depth> Oh, Lucky-- .. Sorry :D
[08:09:03] <Depth> Thought it would be an arrow
[08:09:28] <Drager> Hi, anyone know how to make a download countdown with jquery? Easy
[08:16:54] <benedikt> http://codepad.org/dmKKQctC # The jQuery functions don't come in effect until the browser enters the if statement. how come?
[08:17:25] <NoiseEee> benedikt: uhh what?
[08:18:31] <HassanS> benedikt we'll probably need more context
[08:19:35] <lduros> if I do:  $.post("test.php", {"name": "paul"}); -- shouldn't the value be available in test.php as $_POST['name'] or is it something else? For some reason I can't get the post value from php
[08:19:36] <benedikt> HassanS: $(#signform).hide() isn't executed until signit() returns and the program enters the if statement. signit depends on user input, thats why i notice.
[08:20:58] <r3v3rb> i feel dirty asking is anyone running IE8 still here ?
[08:21:28] <HassanS> benedikt I have no idea why that's happening. :-\
[08:21:42] <HassanS> hehe
[08:21:58] <r3v3rb> can they test the 'browse' button here: http://31daysofgermanriesling.co.uk/win and see if it fires the file input
[08:22:06] <mister_m> BinaryKitten: thanks for your suggestion, that worked great
[08:22:29] <codepython777> I've a string that has all the raw bytes of a jpeg. How do i convert that to an image element in the body?
[08:23:35] <majd> hey #jquery, given a length, what's the best way to generate an array of strings, whose elements are the same as you would appear in the header of a spreadsheet? i.e. ['A', 'B', 'C', ..... 'Z', 'AA', 'BB', 'CC', .... ]
[08:23:37] <Lindrian> When I use jquery ajax call, should I do my stuff with the data on 'success' or on 'complete'?
[08:24:03] <r3v3rb> Lindrian: i'll hazard a guess in onSuccess
[08:24:12] <fRAiLtY-> is a multi-select box still called 'select' in jQuery
[08:24:12] <Lindrian> hm.
[08:27:59] <ArtificialEX> can someone please recommend to me a very clean simple modal library? jquery tools is buggy
[08:29:02] <imsky> i wear my sunglasses at night so i can so i can
[08:31:03] <faraway> majd: you could do it with module division   length%24 is the last letter (you need to convert the int to the letter) and then (length-(length%24))%24 for the next letter an so on
[08:31:48] <faraway> majd: you can do it with a while loop until your currNumber-(currNumber%24)  is 0
[08:32:24] <faraway> majd: ah sort there is a better way in javascript :D
[08:32:55] <faraway> majd: (your number).toString(24)  and then map the resulting string to a-z
[08:34:52] <majd> faraway: right - then i would need a counter to get the AA, BB, etc...
[08:35:00] <majd> when i go over 24
[08:35:57] <faraway> majd: with the toString you don't need to
[08:38:28] <faraway> majd: you do .toString(24)  then you ned to just map 0=>A, 1=>B , 2=>C … A=>K, B=>l …. the question is which is faster :D  i would guess the module one
[08:39:55] <LindsayMac> Good afternoon
[08:42:20] <faraway> majd: a sorry my fault … spreadsheet is another thing :(
[08:46:39] <faraway> majd: thats way easyer   http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/vBQhn/
[08:48:30] <majd> faraway: wow! awesome!
[08:49:24] <majd> faraway: you're a wizard :)
[08:49:50] <faraway> majd: ;) icy i could read questions as good as i can code :P
[08:49:55] <faraway> majd: if i could
[08:50:48] <faraway> majd: the new Array   join hint is just a fast wa for string repeat. so there wil no need for a loop :D
[08:52:06] <rethus> anybody here working with highcharts? I try to ffind out, how i could change the data of the series
[08:53:51] <faraway> majd: i forgot one thing, N must be converted to integer so that you won't get in trouble if you accidentally pass a string that looks like an integer
[08:53:56] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam ping
[08:54:13] <BinaryKitten> you won't be able to get any item from that collection that doesn't have a .slide class
[08:54:39] <BinaryKitten> if you mean you want the only 1 of the 2 classes you can split the string which would give you an array
[08:55:15] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam if you want to check to see if an item has a particular class, then use .hasClass('classtocheckfor')

[09:26:33] <ychaouche> Depth, or this : https://gist.github.com/2625891
[09:27:49] <ychaouche> Depth, yeah, I used it one of my greasemonkey scripts : http://pastie.org/4330987
[09:27:50] <Depth> Is it possible to execute a js-function when a div-container gets visible using jquery?
[09:28:05] <ychaouche> Depth, ^
[09:48:12] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: dude i got the dynamic dialog to work :) and i saw your post on a site
[09:48:28] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: thanks again
[09:50:57] <rretzbach_> Hi, how come $.map(foo, function(i){return parseInt($(i).val());}) gives [1, NaN] even if foo only selects one element?
[09:52:27] <johnkpaul> rretzbach_: what is foo
[09:53:10] <rretzbach_> $("#mediaLibrary .ui-selected")
[09:53:17] <Brodingo> heh
[09:53:35] <rretzbach_> If I remove "parseInt" I get ["1"]
[09:53:47] <Brodingo> map is for iterating over arrays and objects
[09:53:51] <Brodingo> ?map
[09:54:06] <Brodingo> >:|
[09:54:31] <rretzbach_> I get it. I will read the $.map documentation carefully
[09:55:10] <ajpiano> rretzbach_: if you have a jquery object, you should just use $("#foo").map(fn).get()
[09:55:19] <ajpiano> Aut0Exec: awesome!
[09:56:28] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: may i ask you a nub question... yes? ok thanks... javascript falls under "web design" yes?
[09:56:47] <ravenzz> no?
[09:56:58] <Aut0Exec> no?
[09:57:12] <ravenzz> web development ?
[09:57:27] <gnarf> Aut0Exec: i consider "design" the art of making it look cool - JS is development sure
[09:57:28] <ravenzz> or programming or who cares
[09:57:38] <Aut0Exec> i see
[09:57:56] <Aut0Exec> i figured it was more front end stuff... so... web design
[09:58:00] <Brodingo> maybe if youre using it for canvas or something you could consider it design
[09:58:01] <Aut0Exec> guess not
[09:58:07] <Aut0Exec> yeah thats what i thought
[09:58:12] <Aut0Exec> i guess it depends
[09:58:21] <Brodingo> but for the most part its more a development tool
[09:58:39] <Aut0Exec> ok
[09:58:40] <Aut0Exec> kewl
[09:58:50] <Brodingo> cool beans
[09:58:53] <Aut0Exec> so if your doing server side wed dev... you can do this also?
[09:58:56] <Aut0Exec> as a career
[09:59:00] <Aut0Exec> on projects
[09:59:04] <ravenzz> it is a client side programming language you can (also) use to manipulate the dom
[09:59:13] <Brodingo> you can do anything zombo.com style
[09:59:41] <Aut0Exec> i guess what i mean is...... employers usuallly hire... just server side programmers... and just client side programmers ... or do yo uhave to know both?
[10:00:01] <ravenzz> depends on the vacancy i guess
[10:00:05] <Aut0Exec> ok
[10:00:24] <Brodingo> yeah and probably a bigger company would want more specialized people
[10:00:58] <Brodingo> if they have the overhead to fill a lot of roles to work together
[10:10:51] <therealkoopa> Does jquery provide a way to check xhr request progress? For instance if I'm fetching an image, see how many bytes I have received?
[10:24:34] <xboi209> how can i get part of the url between 4th and 5th slashes?
[10:26:13] <sente> url.split('/')[4] <-- or maybe not at all
[10:29:34] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can suggest a really nice simple auto complete?
[10:32:38] <jds_> Heya
[10:33:20] <jds_> Is there a sensible way of inserting an event handler before other existing event handlers?
[10:33:48] <jds_> ie, usually event handlers fire in the order that they've been bound.  I'd like to insert a new handler at the start of the event-firing sequence
[10:36:08] <jds_> $('div').click(function(){console.log('1')});  $('div').click(function(){console.log('2')});  $('div').insertClickSomehow(function(){console.log('0')});
[10:40:07] <jds_> Hmm. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2360655/jquery-event-handlers-always-execute-in-order-they-were-bound-any-way-around-t
[10:40:52] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I'm trying to understand how this tab animation works.. Again, i am still in the learning process.. but when I look at the transitions and watch in Firebug, there are no changes in the style="display:none;" on each tab.. even though they ARE displaying. IM CONFUSED .. how is this working? http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/guqB2/5/
[10:41:38] <carp3> Hi, is there any jquery plugin for dynamic digit grouping for text box ?
[10:42:23] <chinoto[damian]> Anyone here used this before (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder)? I have several images that when click, open a modal dialog, the dialog has an input with a placeholder in it. The problem is that only the first modal dialog gets a working placeholder. (All I did was include the script, removing it also removed the one working placeholder)
[10:42:46] <jds_> LindsayMac: I see the style changing to display:block in Chrome
[10:42:57] <jds_> Think that might just be Firebug being weird.
[10:43:03] <LindsayMac> Herm.. maybe FF is being weird...
[10:43:21] <chinoto[damian]> I mean, only the first image that opens a modal dialog gets the placeholder working.
[10:43:32] <LindsayMac> jds_: im trying to understand the transitions because I tried to change it from slideUp to FadeIn ... and it stopped working
[10:43:35] <jds_> (Honest question : are there any advantages to Firebug over Chrome Inspector nowadays?)
[10:43:49] <LindsayMac> jds_:  only that I can't seem to get Chrome to install on my imac
[10:44:21] <LindsayMac> apparently theres some bug thats kinda widespread and no matter what I do... chrome will not install without giving me the Aw, Snap error evey other page load
[10:44:31] <jds_> Fun
[10:44:42] <jds_> LindsayMac: This fadeIn() works for me in Chrome - http://jsfiddle.net/guqB2/6/
[10:44:45] <LindsayMac> yea.. i'm downloading Mountain Lion to see if it will fix
[10:45:26] <LindsayMac> jds_:  strange.. thats teh same code I was using. Maybe I need to restart my browser.. there's got to be something strange happening
[10:46:02] <chinoto[damian]> I just use Firefox's built in web developer tools, I think I used Firebug at one time though
[10:46:42] <LindsayMac> Well i am just getting in to javascript so firebug always worked well for me when it comes to inspecting css elements and stuff.. So the js debugging is new..
[10:47:23] <jds_> I used to use Firebug all the time, but IMO chrome surpassed it years ago
[10:48:13] <LindsayMac> jds_:  i've really been wanting to use Chrome... i had it installed on my old cpu but only used it when testing sites on it.. but i wanted to try to switch full time.. but sadly... i cant
[10:48:45] <toddWork> im trying to do an ajax call to a local ip address but my server seems to be adding the name in the front.
[10:49:28] <toddWork> so when i type: "url" : "555.555.555.555", it actually requests "ur" : "www.theservername555.555.555.555"
[10:50:35] <jds_> Maybe url should be "http://555.555.55.555" ?
[10:50:56] <toddWork> jds_: yes, tried that. no luck
[10:54:13] <Afflicto> .length //gives me 0 but it's not empty. Why?
[10:54:23] <Afflicto> It's an array.. I think.
[10:54:36] <jds_> Afflicto: Code would help
[10:55:22] <Afflicto> I console.log'd it and it has 1 element. but doing ".length" on it returns 0. I can do a screenshot
[10:56:13] <Afflicto> there you can see it has an element: http://snpr.cm/pKRN5k.png
[10:58:14] <chinoto[damian]> installing IE6 through Wine... god I hate that thing (IE, not Wine)
[10:59:43] <silverwind> Well.. the company you work for is the problem... not the browser.
[11:00:05] <silverwind> Blaming a 11 year old technology is a bit pointless

[11:30:59] <toddWork> i need to access a php file that is at the same level as my web Directory (set in httpd.conf) for an ajax call; my apache keeps putting me in Directory/ so i can't seem to get above it and over one.
[11:33:06] <bakers_> toddparker: apache shouldn't be doing that
[11:33:34] <toddWork> bakers_: well, i want it to so my /wordpress folder dissappears.
[11:33:52] <NoiseEee> toddWork: / *is* the same level as your "web directory"
[11:34:01] <toddWork> so when a user visits www.mysite.com, they don't see www.mysite.com/wordpress
[11:34:32] <toddWork> but my / is set to /www/wordpress; i'm trying to get to /www/services
[11:34:40] <LindsayMac> toddWork:  what's the issue with installing it in the root?
[11:34:50] <LindsayMac> why does it HAVE to be in /wordpress?
[11:35:07] <toddWork> LindsayMac: is certainly doesn't, that is how it was install.
[11:35:13] <NoiseEee> toddWork: "when a user visits www.mysite.com, they don't see www.mysite.com/wordpress" the only possible reason that is happening is because you've set that to happen.
[11:35:18] <LindsayMac> toddWork:  MOVE IT
[11:35:33] <toddWork> thank you.
[11:35:36] <LindsayMac> toddWork:  moving wordpress is a super simple process and they outline it very clearly in the codex .
[11:35:41] <LindsayMac> toddWork:  hold on i'll get the link
[11:35:52] <LindsayMac> toddWork:  http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress
[11:36:25] <LindsayMac> for the most part it is easy but you maybe have to do a find/replace in your database for the old url in reference to embedded images
[11:49:36] <mikehaas763> is {"success":"success","root":"root","rows":"rows","count":"four"} valid json? because I am passing the url where I got that to jquery-ui .autocomplete as the source option but it is not doing anything. when I use an array of values for the source option it does work however.

[11:59:37] <lotus> hey, what's a great highly customizable jquery slider?
[11:59:49] <lotus> the first few links on google aren't that useful
[12:00:18] <lotus> image slider I do mean
[12:01:38] <lotus> looks like Anything Slider
[12:01:49] <Brodingo> cycle

[12:02:58] <Brodingo> yep
[12:03:12] <palatino> hey guys, hoping you can help me remove some text from a div... so I have <div>blah blah blah<br>ya ya ya<br>zee zee zee</div> and I want to remove only the text before the first <br>. Any ideas?
[12:04:19] <lotus> palatino: one sec, trying something using "content"
[12:04:57] <Penny311> Greetings everyone, jquery newbie here
[12:05:08] <jebaird> hello
[12:05:49] <Penny311> anyone here that might be able to answer an easy question?
[12:05:55] <Penny311> jquery related
[12:05:58] <Brodingo> ask away
[12:06:04] <lotus> palatino: http://jsfiddle.net/5Cqap/
[12:06:15] <lotus> ignore the console.log if you'd like.
[12:06:19] <Brodingo> and paste any relevant code if needed Penny311
[12:06:30] <lotus> palatino: the console.log just shows that it's removing the blah blah blah
[12:06:31] <Brodingo> see topic
[12:07:11] <Penny311> sure...well, I've just downloaded JQueryUI, i've placed my js and css files in the appropriate folders, and the development-bundle folder in my root directory
[12:07:17] <lotus> palatino: the console.log is being output in the browser's javascript console (see firebug's "console" or chrome's dev tool's "console" )
[12:07:32] <palatino> wow lotus, that was epically fast
[12:07:39] <Penny311> i tried adding a simple datepicker, but I can't seem to get it to work
[12:07:41] <lotus> palatino: Tell that to my boss.
[12:08:51] <Penny311> added my references to the js and css files in my header, but I'm assuming I've forgotten a peice of the puzzle
[12:09:31] <Penny311> I have a link to the webpage in question if that helps
[12:10:43] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  it helps
[12:11:10] <Penny311> here's the link: http://www.cpa-ct.org/cms/addnewclient.php
[12:11:35] <LindsayMac> yikes
[12:11:37] <jebaird> anyone know of away to delegate events on direct children? something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/jebaird/qsQgd/9/
[12:11:50] <Penny311> the input box labeled Date at the bottom is the datepicker in question
[12:12:10] <jebaird> doesn't like the leading >
[12:12:10] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  that is some messed up structure! Are you making this in dreamweaver/
[12:12:26] <Penny311> yes, lindsay i am
[12:12:36] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  hire a developer.. that is a mess
[12:13:11] <LindsayMac> and Penny311 - you aren't initializing the script.. so you missed one part in the installation of your datepicker.. i dont know which one you are using.. but overall, i would start over
[12:13:55] <Penny311> thanks lindsay
[12:14:34] <LindsayMac> sheesh... honestly Penny311 .. have you looked at it in firefox?
[12:15:09] <Penny311> Lindsay, I have
[12:15:26] <Penny311> we're a non-profit agency, my tools are limited
[12:15:38] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  i've worked for a few non profit agencies....
[12:15:49] <Penny311> and I'm by no means a professional web developer
[12:16:23] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  thats pretty evident.. No offense.. but that looks like they want a user interface to input inportant user data.. a dreamweaver hack is not going to ever make that work
[12:16:43] <Penny311> the page is presentable in IE, but that's it
[12:17:43] <Penny311> would you recommend using something other than DreamWeaver? or is it my code that's the problem?
[12:17:50] <Penny311> or...both :)
[12:18:09] <xmaddness> Hrmm, I really need a new car, I don't know anything about building a car, but i'm pretty sure I'd feel safe putting my 3 year old in mine once I'm done
[12:18:44] <xmaddness> or maybe I could let a professional build it
[12:18:45] <Penny311> point taken
[12:18:48] <xmaddness> just sayin
[12:19:50] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  i recommend LEARNING CODE
[12:20:05] <LindsayMac> but since you don't have 2-3 years to master it.. its time to hire a proller
[12:20:10] <LindsayMac> pro.. ooops.. ha
[12:20:27] <proller> 8-I
[12:20:30] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  what do you plan on doing with this form after you made it? what are you doing with the data entered? Where is it going
[12:20:33] <LindsayMac> lol proller sorry
[12:20:42] <keirlav87> how can i initialise auto complete on an element that is added to the dom dynamically?
[12:20:50] <Penny311> Lindsay, have it tied to an SQL database
[12:21:15] <xmaddness> Are you writing that part aldo?
[12:21:18] <xmaddness> also*
[12:21:18] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  what about validating and sanitizing form content.. Whats your php script? Is it safe?
[12:21:35] <LindsayMac> probably copy/paste from an online tutorial where you download your php script.
[12:21:55] * xmaddness see sql injections in this companies future
[12:22:36] <Penny311> hmm, maybe i will consider a professional.
[12:22:40] <LindsayMac> sees this never actually turning in to anything otehr than a playground in dreamweaver
[12:22:48] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  no.. you NEED a profession
[12:22:49] <LindsayMac> al
[12:22:55] <LindsayMac> sheesh I can't type today
[12:22:57] <NoiseEee> yeah Al is great
[12:23:02] <jeffsmykil> I'm trying to do a regex replace and the replace text needs to be \' this is creating a small problem
[12:23:04] <jeffsmykil> var test = f[i].Name.replace(/\'/g, "\'");
[12:23:21] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  you are opening up that organization to serious hacks and attacks on the database.
[12:23:38] <LindsayMac> UNLESS you know what you are doing with the form submit, validation, and sanitization
[12:23:39] <chinoto[damian]> [1:00PM] silverwind & LindsayMac: I was installing IE6 to ensure things were working, not because I WANT to use it
[12:23:44] <Penny311> Lindsay, like you said, until now it's just a playgrund
[12:23:48] <Penny311> playground*
[12:23:59] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  and i should stay that way.. that should never be launched live.
[12:24:30] <LindsayMac> this is what I dont understand.. people choose to LEARN on client projects.. ??!! even if the client isn't paying you, this is a project that could have mejor repurcussions if not done correctly.
[12:24:48] <chinoto[damian]> silly people still using IE(6), they should just use a new browser instead of being forced to stick with an old version of the default browser.
[12:24:54] <LindsayMac> I mean sure, there are things you can definitely learn while working.. its common.. but to learn the industry as a whole is crazy
[12:25:12] <LindsayMac> chinoto[damian]:  There are a FEW industries where i would account for IE6 but most i dont even consider it
[12:25:15] <Penny311> you're right
[12:25:20] <chinoto[damian]> LindsayMac: it's kinda of like trying to "learn terminal"
[12:25:27] <LindsayMac> Hahahaha.
[12:25:32] <LindsayMac> and blow up your computer.
[12:25:41] <xmaddness> Or learning to skydive on your opwn
[12:25:56] <xmaddness> "I packed my own chute, it's cool though, I read about it in a magazine once"
[12:26:07] <Penny311> you just pull the cord right?
[12:26:12] <LindsayMac> or learning to drive in your best friends brand new BMW on the highway in rush hour with a parallel parking spot at the end
[12:26:14] <xmaddness> yep
[12:26:23] * xmaddness bbl
[12:26:34] <chinoto[damian]> well the thing about learning things like terminal, is it's "learn the bit you need, when you need it" otherwise you just waste your time
[12:26:36] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  hire a pro. There's plenty of ways to find them.. in fact, theres a bunch right here
[12:26:44] <imsky> pro checking in!
[12:26:56] <LindsayMac> in fact, you are talking to many ..
[12:27:09] <Penny311> I think I'll take that route instead.
[12:27:17] <Penny311> thanks for the dose of reality
[12:27:18] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  i think thats a good idea.
[12:27:25] <Brodingo> then when something goes wrong its not your fault!
[12:27:28] <Brodingo> yay
[12:27:29] <LindsayMac> Penny311:  thanks for being accepting of it. Many people take offense
[12:27:34] <LindsayMac> yay Brodingo
[12:27:51] <Brodingo> um yay!!
[12:28:06] <LindsayMac> weeeee

[12:32:04] <LindsayMac> codepython777:  you gave up on fontawesome/bootstrap ?
[12:32:12] <LindsayMac> why not just do the css tricks one?
[12:32:37] <codepython777> LindsayMac: seemed easier this way, i guess not :)
[12:33:05] <LindsayMac> no.. the css tricks is about the best way to do that in my opinion. Especially since you're using fontawesome already and bootstrap
[12:33:10] <LindsayMac> just follow the tuturial

[12:35:28] <mikehaas763> you said to paste links to code
[12:35:41] <LindsayMac> what?? i dont think i did....

[12:37:39] <mikehaas763> When a String is used, the Autocomplete plugin expects that string to point to a URL resource that will return JSON data. It can be on the same host or on a different one (must provide JSONP).
[12:38:04] <mikehaas763> I took that from jquery-ui autocomplete docs, does that mean it must be jsonp for a remote host or for both?

[13:06:45] <saimon69> hmmm
[13:06:57] <saimon69> need to elaborate more on this then
[13:07:21] <saimon69> how can i recover what classes are assigned to an element
[13:07:23] <saimon69> ?
[13:07:32] <shoky> maybe what you want is smth like: var classes = $(element).attr('class').split(' ');
[13:07:44] <saimon69> can try that
[13:08:00] <shoky> then you can $.each(classes, function..)  or whatever you need
[13:08:18] <shoky> and switch() inside your loop i suppose
[13:09:10] <saimon69> well have already a each loop to check all :input elements
[13:09:34] <saimon69> so will be like another each() inside the first one and then switch
[13:09:48] <saimon69> wonder if i can do it in a more elegant way
[13:09:52] <shoky> yes. one loop for the elements, and an inner loop for each element's classes
[13:10:01] <saimon69> k
[13:10:24] <shoky> don't know why you need to loop through all the classes though
[13:10:41] <shoky> just so you can use a switch?
[13:10:47] <shoky> that is hardly elegant
[13:11:29] <shoky> just use 'if' and 'hasClass'
[13:12:54] <saimon69> shoky: as said am doing my own form validation; that should also include regexp check and stuff and be kinda stand alone so that i can link same file with different forms (made of course in the same way) and work
[13:13:15] <saimon69> i lack knowledge on how to do oop and recursion properly though
[13:13:23] <scalex000> troll-boy, hi
[13:16:03] <shoky> saimon69: sure, but why would a form validator need to know ALL classes that a field has?
[13:16:27] <sunbeam> how can i completely delete a certain div or fieldset with a certain .class?
[13:16:41] <saimon69> my idea was to use classes to recognize the validation
[13:17:04] <saimon69> first check if field is required and so check what kind of regexp i have to compare with
[13:20:27] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: $('.className').remove();  //goodbye everything with .className
[13:20:50] <medicineuk> Hello ladies and gents I have a simple question for you… can you put a loop inside a loop in javascript and if you do will the outer loop wait for the inner loop before it starts again
[13:21:31] <shoky> saimon69: i'd do smth like-  var validationClasses = ['required', 'number', 'etc'];  $('form :input').map(function(input) { return {input:input, results: $.map(validationClasses, function(class) { return ..validation logic on input & class..; }) }; });
[13:22:28] <shoky> well, assign the $('form :input').map(...  to a variable and then i have the validation results for each input/class in that variable
[13:22:56] <shoky> you could play with the object structure of course, to suit your needs
[13:24:09] <shoky> sry should be $('form :input').map(function(i, input) { ...
[13:24:18] <shoky> silly jquery :\
[13:29:56] <bricker88> I'm having what I'm sure is a common problem with propagation. Basically I have a mouseenter event that fades in an element on top of the target. The problem, of course, is that once the image fades in it then immediately registers a mouseleave event. What is the proper way to get around this?
[13:31:27] <gmad> Hi!
[13:33:01] <gmad> Could you advice me good tutorial about jQuery deferred object (other then original docs). I suppose I should use this function, but I do not understand how.
[13:33:18] <shoky> gmad: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[13:34:34] <gmad> Thanks! I will read it. I would like to use it with html5 filesystem api to create function which return string from read file...
[13:35:50] <shoky> no idea about that api, but that sounds like a proper job for deferreds, indeed
[13:38:46] <medicineuk> I'm trying to store items from a loop in a nested array with something like liText[c[b]] = arrayOfli[b].innerHTML; don't seem to work
[13:42:39] <shoky> ?p @ medicineuk
[13:42:39] <bot-t> medicineuk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:42:40] <b-ot> bot-t, you have 2 new messages, just say “read” to me when you wish to read them.
[13:42:40] <bot-t> b-ot, Is that a question?
[13:42:45] <b-ot> bot-t, As I see it, yes.

[13:46:56] <ztaylor> I need a little help with draggable images. I have an image that I'd like to be able to drag and reposition, and I'd like to disable the default browser behavior which allows the image to be dragged (to the desktop, for example). setting draggable to false, or preventing default behavior for mousedown or dragstart events, works to disable the browser dragging but prevents me from capturing drag events as well. Any guidance?
[13:47:35] <medicineuk> I'm trying to get all the text out of each inner ul but grouped in an array
[13:48:45] <medicineuk> would be even better if it was in different arrays but it seems to be flexible i.e so hard-coding the number of ul
[13:49:56] <medicineuk> liText[c[b]] just gets  completely over ridden but the last bit of text that is collected
[13:54:55] <gmad> anybody knows any about html5 filesystem api?
[13:56:15] <frewsxcv> is .each() syncronous?
[13:57:20] <silverwind> Yes sir.
[13:57:28] <eip56> elo
[13:57:36] <shoky> medicineuk your code doesn't make much sense
[13:57:43] <frewsxcv> Does it say that anywhere in the docs?
[13:57:44] <shoky> none at all
[13:57:48] <frewsxcv> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:58:20] <shoky> frewsxcv: it's a loop, it doesn't do anything that it'd have to wait for
[13:58:22] <hootler> hi... if i have a script and a png coming from a server which i control but being called from several other sites which i do not, can the script access a cookie that is set in a header attached to the image?
[13:58:24] <medicineuk> shaky yer thought you might so that sorry it's everywhere been banging my head against a brink wall
[13:58:31] <shoky> like i/o
[13:59:17] <b0bi> Hi, i have the following: <div id="1"><p><div id="2"></div></p></div> , is there any reason why $("#2").parent() will bring the outer div and not the p?
[13:59:42] <dabaR> If I go to a URL in my browser, like http://www.google.ca, it loads fine. If I make a jQuery.ajax or jQuery.get request, firebug shows status 200 OK, empty response, and it is highlighted in red because there is no response body.
[13:59:53] <mhack> you can't have a <div> in a <p>
[13:59:58] <dabaR> I'll make a pastebin with the code.
[14:00:15] <silverwind> IDs cannot start with a number AFAIK...
[14:00:43] <silverwind> dabaR, the same-origin policy forbids you to do that.
[14:00:57] <gmad> anybody knows any about html5 filesystem api? I feel I need to use when() then() to create function which return file content. Am I right?
[14:01:04] <b0bi> silverwind: the id does not start with numbers in my case, i was just showing for the example
[14:01:20] <b0bi> dabaR: so the problem is me having a div inside a p?
[14:01:30] <dabaR> b0bi: talk to mhack
[14:01:38] <silverwind> b0bi, it should work then, browsers are good at dealing with shit markup
[14:01:38] <Brodingo> gmad you could try asking #html5
[14:01:38] <dabaR> silverwind: OK. I need to get some data from some API
[14:01:45] <dabaR> jsonp?
[14:01:46] <b0bi> sorry oops
[14:01:55] <b0bi> mhack: so the problem is me having a div inside a p?
[14:01:55] <mhack> yes sir, AFAIK you shouldn't do that
[14:02:03] <b0bi> I see
[14:02:07] <dabaR> silverwind: make a server-side thingy that does it for me?
[14:02:08] <silverwind> dabaR, that's the usual hack to get data from a different domain
[14:02:14] <mhack> got any code to look at ?
[14:02:14] <dabaR> Thanks
[14:02:19] <silverwind> dabaR, Yeah, a server proxy might be better
[14:02:40] <dabaR> I can't see why it would be better at this time
[14:02:41] <dabaR> You?
[14:02:46] <bricker88> I'm having a problem where a mouseenter event is being fired everytime I mouse my mouse while hovered over the element, causing it to be fired hundreds of time. Is this a common issue?
[14:02:47] <ogk1000> so I have this little snippet I wrote to set an input val to another val... it works sometimes but not everytime.. I am wondering if there is a better way to write it: http://collabedit.com/m72f3 any feedback would be great
[14:02:53] <dabaR> I mean, do you know of any reasons...
[14:03:12] <shoky> medicineuk: anyway, don't make your own loops, use jquery's .each and .map
[14:03:14] <silverwind> dabaR, because jsonp is awful, doesn't support anything but GET.. etc..
[14:03:36] <silverwind> dabaR, jsonp == loading javascript with a <script> tag
[14:03:38] <dabaR> I guess I don't even know anything about jsonp, good enough. Thank you very much
[14:03:51] <jedimind> wiat
[14:03:52] <jedimind> what
[14:04:02] <jedimind> jsonp = loading js with a <script> tag ?
[14:04:03] <medicineuk> shoky so what I'm basically trying do if put a each inside an each is that OK code
[14:04:04] <jedimind> wtf does that mean
[14:04:09] <medicineuk> ??
[14:04:17] <shoky> medicineuk that's ok to do

[14:05:50] <ogk1000> small issue so weird it works sometimes but not others
[14:06:06] <jedimind> ask away man, doesnt have to be directed at me, but i'll help if i can
[14:06:07] <medicineuk> shaky map looks like it might do want I'm want will take a closer look
[14:08:04] <shoky> ogk1000  never do  $this = $(this);
[14:08:15] <shoky> do:  var $this = $(this);
[14:08:20] <shoky> otherwise you are asking for trouble
[14:08:34] <shoky> same for your other local variables
[14:11:35] <ogk1000> my problem is .. if you click begin date and choose a month ahead then end date it only SOMETIMES grabs the actual date

[14:15:11] <ogk1000> any feedback?
[14:15:59] <sunbeam> i'd like to listen if ANY of a certain checkbox is being checked in #form
[14:16:02] <sunbeam> how can i do that?
[14:16:14] <ogk1000> is there a way to do a callback on an input field being changed
[14:16:21] <sente> what do you think?
[14:16:23] <sente> if you had to guess
[14:16:42] <ogk1000> ok then how do you do it
[14:17:11] <sente> oddly enough i wasn't meaning to be snarky
[14:17:31] <ogk1000> sunbeam, if ($("#phone-option").is(":checked")) { // do something }
[14:17:38] <ogk1000> or switch phone option to a class ?
[14:17:49] <ogk1000> sente, how do you do it
[14:18:36] <Pistos> I have some CSS3 transitions, which I am manipulating with toggleClass().  However, it only seems to be working when I have: 1) setup with addClass; 2) alert or breakpoint; 3) toggleClass().  If I remove step 2, the setup doesn't seem to be taking effect.  Does jQuery cache or precompile, or optimize or something along those lines?
[14:18:55] <sunbeam> ogk1000: no i need to listen for it
[14:19:32] <Tronic> I am working on a REST-style API that uses JSON requests for everything. Apparently GET request cannot contain HTTP body (where the JSON would go) so alternative solutions are needed.
[14:19:57] <ogk1000> do you need to listen? it only does something upon an action ?
[14:20:05] <silverwind> Tronic, using GET for queries doesn't really make sense...
[14:20:17] <sente> $('.target').change(function() { alert('Handler for .change() called.');
[14:20:24] <shoky> Tronic i thought we covered this yesterday
[14:20:26] <silverwind> Err
[14:20:26] <Tronic> silverwind: GET for getting documents does not make sense, how?
[14:20:39] <silverwind> Tronic, I said the opposite I wanted to say :D
[14:20:49] <silverwind> Tronic, GET only makes sense for queries..
[14:20:56] <Tronic> Three of the most viable ones seem to be (a) urlsafe base64 encode the JSON as GET parameter, (b) JSON as custom HTTP header, (c) different method (e.g. PROPFIND)
[14:21:24] <silverwind> Tronic, what do you want to do?
[14:21:45] <Tronic> silverwind: Specify my query in JSON (because it is too complex to be put in URL, plus it also contains auth data).
[14:22:09] <silverwind> :/
[14:22:11] <Tronic> Someone on StackOverflow suggested PROPFIND and a bunch of other methods not part of HTTP but with similar semantics (get a document).
[14:22:54] <silverwind> Tronic, for a query, GET should be enough... not sure how it would be too complex. As for the auth data, it should be sent as HTTP headers.
[14:23:01] <styol> Tronic: why not POST?
[14:23:15] <shoky> "its not RESTful semantics"
[14:23:26] <silverwind> REST is impossible in the browser.
[14:23:31] <shoky> "as if a complex GET is"
[14:23:32] <silverwind> Only for APIs.
[14:23:33] <imachuchu> Any advice on attaching jquery events to objects inserted into a div after a get based on shared class (some elements have it, some don't, I want to attach on the ones with the class)
[14:23:39] <Tronic> styol: Because it does not create a new entity on the server (what POST is for). Also it does not modify existing ones (so PUT and DELETE are out of the question too).
[14:24:09] <styol> Tronic: ahh failed to make that correlation indeed
[14:24:58] <evasivx_> Hey guys. For the "Contact Us" link in the navigation. How would i go about getting It's "Careers" sub navigation link and only it to be placed right before "Contact Us"? http://projectomni.com/granite/
[14:25:48] <styol> Tronic: and deducing things into a unique ID is out of the question right? like /rest/get/123
[14:27:18] <Tronic> styol: In the general case, yes. I already use that for things where it is well suited.
[14:27:26] <shoky> his first sentence says it all  "I am working on a REST-style API that uses JSON requests for everything."
[14:28:10] <silverwind> shoky, using JSON for a GET doesn't make sense..
[14:28:19] <styol> JSON responses makes sense
[14:28:24] <silverwind> Of course!
[14:28:26] <shoky> exactly my point, silverwind
[14:28:49] <shoky> he already agreed with me yesterday that POST would be the best option
[14:29:01] <silverwind> Ah...

[14:39:31] <shoky> medicineuk that still doesn't make sense. you have NumberOfLoops which is an integer. but then you do:  ChartText[NumberOfLoops[index]] = $(this).text();
[14:39:40] <jenia> its called unique urls ajax pattern i think
[14:39:47] <shoky> medicineuk:  NumberOfLoops[index] doesn't make sense. NumberOfLoops is not an array

[14:50:28] <medicineuk> shoky oohhh lovely thanks will have to have a look at push
[14:54:12] <shoky> sunbeam: do you care about when a checkbox is being checked by other javascript code (and not by the user)?
[14:54:41] <sunbeam> no doesn't matter

[14:56:33] <GreekFreak> I have a few functions that I use again and again. I would like to have them in one file and include them in other files. or something similar. Any ideas? My file is 1600 lines long and I'm trying to refactor it
[14:56:45] <sunbeam> and if something is visible (other than block) is there a jquery function to check with that?
[14:57:50] <shoky> sunbeam not sure what you mean exactly but there's the :visible selector
[14:58:50] <shoky> GreekFreak for dependency management between different scripts you might wanna check out smth like require.js
[15:00:02] <scotdb> Looking for suggestions on how best to do a rather interesting user request.   They have five mutually exclusive options (the kind you'd normally use radio buttons for) ... but each selection then spawns the need for one or more additional different data entry fields (different types : one wants an additional checkbox and the others want various text entry fields which I will also need to validate).
[15:00:10] * daslicht slaps daslicht around a bit with a large trout
[15:00:41] <daslicht> <--- funny
[15:00:44] <GreekFreak> shoky thank you. And how is that different from creating my own jquery plugin, or namespace?
[15:01:09] <shoky> GreekFreak: there is no dependency management at all with jquery plugins/namespaces
[15:01:13] <sunbeam> shoky: yes, something like isVisible
[15:01:30] <shoky> GreekFreak: you can't say in one plugin 'i depend on another plugin'
[15:02:00] <shoky> you just have to include them in the right order
[15:03:05] <GreekFreak> shoky, the problem with that is that I'm coding in rails, and it encloses each file in a document.ready()  And I need some functions to be used in more than one, rather than copy/paste them. I thought that's what the namespacing does
[15:03:13] <codephobic> I'm new to jQuery (and Javascript as a whole). I would like to know whether it is possible to pass a variable (as a parameter) into an anonymous function which contains within it an ajax function, so that the variable can then be used to query a php page and return some json data?
[15:03:49] <GreekFreak> shoky, I don't need dependency to that level. I can load the files in the right order. I just need to break this file down without copying the first 20 functions
[15:03:52] <shoky> GreekFreak: you can put those functions in one js file and include it first, i guess
[15:04:24] <shoky> oh rails puts it in a dom ready handler.
[15:04:36] <GreekFreak> shoky, ya
[15:05:00] <shoky> um. does it have to?
[15:05:08] <GreekFreak> shoky, so how does this jQuery.fn.  do?
[15:05:18] <shoky> what?
[15:05:19] <GreekFreak> shoky, I don't know and I'd rather not fiddle with it
[15:05:43] <shoky> you can define your own namespace under the global window object i guess
[15:06:07] <GreekFreak> shoky, I'm referring to this "jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function()"
[15:06:11] <shoky> window.myFunctions = {};
[15:06:34] <shoky> GreekFreak, what are you asking about it?
[15:07:02] <shoky> that adds a function to the jQuery object prototype
[15:07:05] <scotdb> codephobic ... yes it must be possible, because that's exactly what I do when getting data with JSON for putting into dataTables
[15:07:19] <shoky> so that you can do $(....).myPlugin(...)
[15:07:25] <GreekFreak> shoky, everyone tells me about require.js, and it seems that might solve my problem, yet noone recommends it
[15:07:47] <shoky> GreekFreak: i told you one way , use the global window object
[15:08:08] <GreekFreak> shoky, ok cool. I'll give it a try. thank you
[15:08:08] <codephobic> scotdb, mind if I ask you a few more questions?
[15:09:07] <scotdb> codephobic ... go ahead but I'm not for ahead of you on the jQuery learning curve

[15:10:45] <shoky> hootler: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[15:11:18] <shoky> hootler: also you are using 'this' inside a nested function, very bad
[15:11:39] <shoky> oh my and a nested loop too
[15:11:45] <shoky> you are asking for a world of hurt
[15:11:49] <hootler> shoky: what's causing the unexpected } though?
[15:12:01] <hootler> well please help me improve then! :)
[15:12:18] <hootler> what's bad about those things?
[15:12:48] <shoky> hootler: 'this' often changes when inside different functions
[15:13:01] <hootler> shoky: oh, really?
[15:13:02] <shoky> hootler: you didn't close the .click(
[15:13:29] <hootler> ahhhh! mannn
[15:13:45] <hootler> http://jsfiddle.net/BjjBc/843/
[15:13:50] <hootler> although it still doesn't work.
[15:14:12] <shoky> hootler: also, your loop is increasing 'i' and calling setTimeout, passing a callback that uses that 'i'. but by the time the callback is called, your loop will already be finished
[15:14:20] <shoky> and 'i' will have its final value by the time the callback is called
[15:14:45] <shoky> you need a local function scope for each loop iteration, in order to save the current 'i' value
[15:15:10] <hootler> shoky: you just went way over my head... ;)
[15:15:45] <shoky> hootler but.. jquery has .fadeOut()  ;)
[15:15:55] <shoky> and .animate()
[15:16:00] <shoky> and other shit ;)
[15:16:02] <hootler> shoky: yes, but i'm using zepto...
[15:16:06] <shoky> ah
[15:16:21] <shoky> why :)
[15:17:17] <hootler> i need it to be as lightweight as possible.
[15:17:53] <shoky> but you don't know javascript ;]
[15:18:49] <sunbeam> how can i get the last index of an array?
[15:18:53] <sunbeam> in jquery
[15:19:05] <hootler> shoky: what do you mean? i'm trying to learn...
[15:19:23] <evasivx_> Hey guys. For the "Contact Us" link in the navigation. How would i go about getting It's "Careers" sub navigation link and only it to be placed right before "Contact Us"? http://projectomni.com/granite/
[15:19:25] <sunbeam> or get the word from a string that looks like slide-* (where * is a number) with regexp?
[15:19:31] <shoky> hootler: ok sorry. fair enough
[15:20:10] <shoky> hootler: your loop also completes in an instant, and all your setTimeouts have a timeout of 5ms
[15:20:18] <shoky> so they all execute at the same time
[15:21:09] <hootler> the effect is supposed to total 250 ms.
[15:21:33] <hootler> shoky: i also felt like it would be a good exercise to learn how the animation functions work internally.
[15:23:16] <hootler> shoky: can you offer me some tips for fixing it / making it work?
[15:24:17] <shoky> hootler: there are so many things wrong :\
[15:24:28] <shoky> hootler: this.style.opacity  gets you an empty string
[15:24:57] <hootler> shoky: should i be using $(this).css('opacity')?
[15:25:07] <shoky> yes
[15:25:13] <shoky> ok i fixed it up for you kinda
[15:25:29] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/BjjBc/845/
[15:25:44] <shoky> but i just added that  delay += 5;  arbitrarily
[15:26:11] <shoky> donno why i did it like that, hold on
[15:26:32] <hootler> shoky: well either way, it helped me understand some things, so thanks.
[15:29:12] <saba> I'm doing $(this).nextAll(':parent').toggleClass('foo'). This is not what I want though. I want to set .foo if any of the :parent elements already has .foo (one or more). If none has .foo I want to remove .foo from all matched elements. Any suggestion on how to do this in a smooth and efficient way?
[15:29:22] <saba> maybe there's some killer jquery function I've missed in the later versions.
[15:31:49] <saba> ehe, I forgot that if *all* elements has .foo - I also want to remove it.
[15:31:59] <hootler> shoky: were you still planning to change it again/
[15:32:02] <getxsick> hi
[15:32:20] <shoky> hootler yea but i gave up :P
[15:32:26] <saba> .. not if none has it. No point of removing if none has it, obviously.
[15:32:30] <hootler> shoky: hah.
[15:32:40] <hootler> shoky: what were you planning to do?
[15:34:05] <shoky> hootler: wanted to make the inner setTimeout callback call setTimeout again , so it'll be a more recursive loop than an iterative loop like you did
[15:34:50] <sunbeam> how can i see whether a certain checkbox with an #some-id is checked?
[15:34:55] <hootler> shoky: ooh, sounds interesting... but what'd the benefit be?
[15:35:33] <shoky> hootler: the way you're doing it now, your loop runs and sets like 50 timeouts
[15:35:39] <shoky> at once
[15:36:00] <shoky> instead of having it only call the next setTimeout when the previous one is finished
[15:36:04] <hootler> shoky: so, what's wrong with that?
[15:36:11] <hootler> shoky: ohhh, i see.
[15:36:21] <hootler> so how would one do that, then?
[15:36:29] <shoky> heh
[15:36:31] <hootler> that's actually pretty interesting.
[15:37:45] <shoky> sec
[15:40:02] <shoky> hootler: http://jsfiddle.net/BjjBc/850/
[15:40:11] <saba> solved in a good way I believe, tell me if you're interested.
[15:45:20] <creature> To answer my own question: it wasn't jquery appending in the wrong place, it was jquery appending not to the DOM but to the code. Because my images were in a div, and the closing div was on a newline, the new image got appended after that newline/whitespace.
[15:48:45] <hootler> shoky: seems like zepto actually has $.animate()... would you use that, or thr /850/ link you just gave?  (thanks, btw)...
[15:49:20] <shoky> hootler if it already has it i'd use that..
[15:49:41] <hootler> ok.
[15:49:44] <hootler> it just doesn't have fade()
[15:49:47] <shoky> hootler: unless you're intent on learning
[15:50:00] <hootler> but i can still use that to do {opacity: 0}
[15:50:20] <hootler> hey, shoky: do you know much about the SOP?
[15:50:34] <shoky> hootler: not much, some :P
[15:50:46] <hootler> i've got kind of a tricky question...
[15:51:43] <shoky> as long as it's not a trick question
[15:52:23] <hootler> shoky: so if i have a script and a png coming from a server which i control but being called from several other sites which i do not, can the script access a cookie that is set in a header attached to the image?
[15:52:28] <hootler> nope, just difficult.
[15:52:31] <hootler> at least for me.
[15:53:16] <shoky> can a script do that to an image, at all?
[15:53:47] <shoky> i mean, if it was all on one server
[15:54:16] <shoky> and assuming the png is loaded as an image resource
[15:54:52] <shoky> i think the answer is no, anyways. may be wrong tho
[15:56:02] <getxsick> is this function correct? http://pastebin.com/p72k6DFN
[15:56:40] <hootler> shoky: i don't have a server to test it on though, that's the problem
[15:57:04] <getxsick> it's working as i want in plain HTML file but for some reasons the callback func for load() method never happen when i use it under WordPress
[15:57:25] <shoky> getxsick it'd make more sense like this.. http://pastebin.com/w2fiPPhb
[15:58:26] <shoky> or maybe the doc.ready makes more sense for you the way you had it before, donno
[15:58:32] <shoky> it would also work
[15:58:48] <shoky> but .load sure needs a url
[15:59:35] <shoky> hootler: i don't think it's possible either way ;P unless your script is fetching the image via ajax
[15:59:38] <SmashingX> Hi guys I was wondering if anyone can help me with this problem. I have a form in where whatever of the values represented as checkboxes, if any of those are clicked the option underneath Amount 1 would be selected, otherwiseif none of the checkboxes are selected Amount 2 must be selected, if someone could help me to figure out 1 of the checkboxes I could fiugre out the rest.
[15:59:44] <SmashingX> The Problem is: http://jsfiddle.net/RQaL8/1/
[15:59:56] <getxsick> shoky: it's working!
[16:00:02] <getxsick> shoky: btw. can i use random URL?
[16:00:07] <shoky> huh?
[16:00:13] <shoky> ohh
[16:00:19] <shoky> #imgMain is an <img>
[16:00:29] <shoky> i didn't realize that, sorry
[16:00:39] <shoky> so .load doesn't need a url :P
[16:00:52] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:01:37] <shoky> getxsick: so.. no idea about wordpress
[16:01:49] <getxsick> shoky: i put a random url and it's working now
[16:01:50] <chovy> how do i detect ie9?
[16:02:23] <shoky> getxsick: no no, forget what i said about the url and disregard my update to your paste
[16:02:31] <shoky> getxsick: you don't need any url anywhere
[16:02:38] <getxsick> shoky: why? it's working now
[16:02:43] <getxsick> even if it's strange
[16:02:54] <shoky> getxsick: i was thinking of a totally different .load ..
[16:03:08] <shoky> er
[16:03:20] <shoky> what is #imgMain  ?
[16:03:37] <getxsick> id of img
[16:03:53] <getxsick> i jsut wanted to put a spinning ball before the image will be completely loaded
[16:04:05] <shoky> yeah.. so having a url there doesnt make sense ;)
[16:04:34] <getxsick> yeah, but for some reason it's required
[16:05:49] <shoky> no idea what's goin on there..
[16:06:17] <OomElvis> Q: $(this).find('input,textarea').parent().parent() <--- for the last parent (which is a <tr>), it should contain a certain class - how do i specify that?

[16:11:18] <fatmandown> if I want to initialize the datePicker class w/ restricted days based on a select menu's value, would I use onChange?
[16:11:59] <Einzig> hello, I created a date picker. When selecting "kwartaal 3" from the drop down menu, the month has MMM instead of the MM  format. The rest neatly shows MM. I have no idea why..  http://jsbin.com/aqedot/8/edit
[16:13:02] <HarryPitfall> interesting... new jQuery.ui version... and jQuery 1.8?
[16:14:33] <hootler> shoky: what code editor do you use?
[16:14:58] <SmashingX> somebody could help me?

[16:16:39] <Ferazel> Question: I have a newbie question. I have a video object, but in front of the video object I want to have a semi-transparent image (like a border frame). Can anyone point me to a way to either forward all mouse events (or better yet) make the transparent image not consume mouse events?
[16:17:27] <sunbeam> how can I prevent a checkbox from being unselected?
[16:17:40] <sunbeam> eg. the user is not able to untick a checkbox?
[16:18:02] <Einzig> disable
[16:18:13] <shoky> hootler: for javascript? either any old text-editor, or webstorm
[16:18:15] <SmashingX> shoky: your solution it's fine but If I add another checkbox that's not related to the radiobuttons it wil also change the radiobuttons
[16:18:33] <shoky> SmashingX: then you'll need to address that
[16:18:56] <mfoxdogg|work> sunbeam: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com.au/2008/12/how-to-disableenable-element-with.html
[16:19:07] <SmashingX> shoky: Im sorry I thought I said that now I notice I didn't
[16:19:29] <shoky> SmashingX: define "related"
[16:19:51] <hootler> hrmph
[16:19:56] <SmashingX> shoky: in the same form but that if I checked it doesn't change the radiobuttons
[16:20:03] <kevinquinnyo> hey guys i just made a bookmarklet that helps me highlight certain divs on a web portal i use for work.  the content that it acts on is refreshed every 30 seconds, should i : make a browser extension for this?
[16:20:05] <shoky> SmashingX: my fiddle selects the checkboxes whose name starts with something. if you need to select other checkboxes, then change the selector...
[16:20:07] <SmashingX> shoky I did this: http://jsfiddle.net/RQaL8/5/ but I think it's too much code
[16:20:15] <sunbeam> mfoxdogg|work: no i want to be able to select it
[16:20:17] <sunbeam> but not unselect it
[16:20:24] <shoky> SmashingX: indeed that is too much code
[16:20:27] <kevinquinnyo> or : figure out another way
[16:20:41] <mfoxdogg|work> sunbeam: put the disable oin the click eventy
[16:20:56] <SmashingX> shoky: and that's just for 2 checkboxes, I need to add the other 3
[16:22:43] <SmashingX> shoky: so if I understand well your code you are saying all the checkboxes that start with "onbehalf[custom_65]" will trigger the change in the radiobuttons
[16:22:51] <SmashingX> shoky: am I right?
[16:24:38] <shoky> SmashingX: http://jsfiddle.net/RQaL8/9/
[16:24:53] <shoky> SmashingX yes that's what my previous fiddle does
[16:25:07] <raj> wutup yo
[16:25:20] <SmashingX> so is that what the ^ symbol does? starting with this string
[16:25:24] <shoky> oi dr.raj
[16:25:38] <shoky> SmashingX: yes http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[16:26:21] <SmashingX> ok thanks shoky let me check that out
[16:26:34] <SmashingX> I appreciate your help man
[16:26:43] <shoky> np
[16:28:08] <joikus> I use this to check if at least one letter in string: /[a-z]/i.test(value)
[16:28:19] <joikus> how can I check if there is at least 2 letters in the string
[16:30:27] <SmashingX> shoky: just one more question: Why did you change the code from 4 to 9? I see more code on 9 but 4 is working
[16:30:44] <SmashingX> shoky: any special addition?
[16:31:02] <shoky> SmashingX: because you complained that if you add more checkboxes it would also select them..
[16:31:15] <shoky> SmashingX: so i made it very specific so you can do whatever you want with it ;P
[16:31:29] <SmashingX> shoky: but if those other checkboxes don't start with the same name I'm out of trouble
[16:31:36] <SmashingX> right¿?
[16:31:37] <shoky> SmashingX: indeed
[16:31:40] <SmashingX> nice
[16:31:50] <SmashingX> thanks shoky I appreciate your help
[16:31:56] <SmashingX> that's exactly what I needed

[16:33:25] <Einzig> check the third answer
[16:33:57] <SmashingX> shoky: this line is like reading chinese to me: var checked = checkboxes.is(':checked') ? 'checked' : '';
[16:34:09] <SmashingX> do you know where I can learn more about what is in it?
[16:34:20] <SmashingX> is that a triple if statement?
[16:35:22] <joikus> Einzig: hmm
[16:35:25] <Einzig> joikus: [^0-9]{2} should match two
[16:35:26] <GreekFreak> I have a button whose click event runs an ajax request. Why would the request be run twice?
[16:35:28] <shoky> SmashingX:  it expands to:   var checked;  if (checkboxes.is(':checked')) { checked = 'checked' } else { checked = '' }
[16:35:53] <SmashingX> wow
[16:35:59] <SmashingX> impressive
[16:36:23] <shoky> ya its useful
[16:36:42] <SmashingX> so it was what I thought it was the triple if statement in one line
[16:37:00] <SmashingX> but I saw it in other anguages and it doesn't look that compicated as this one
[16:37:34] <TelFiRE> I have set up a slidetoggle and whenever I click the trigger it opens for a second but immediately closes

[16:37:45] <joikus> but now if my string is "a1 a1" as in 2 words
[16:38:02] <joikus> it doesn;t count 2 letters
[16:38:10] <joikus> sorry i meants:
[16:38:14] <joikus>  return /[a-z]{2}/i.test(value);
[16:38:40] <Einzig> right, sorry [^0-9] would match other characters as well
[16:39:04] <shoky> x{2}  looks for 'xx'
[16:40:11] <Einzig> Can someone help me with this?> When selecting "kwartaal 3" from the drop down menu, the month has MMM instead of the MM  format. The rest neatly shows MM. I have no idea why..  http://jsbin.com/aqedot/8/edit
[16:40:30] <joikus> ya I don't want 'xx' I want 'x2 x2' as well
[16:42:07] <joikus> unless I get rid of non-letters
[16:42:23] <joikus> and test that, hmm ghetto

[16:44:27] <shoky> joikus:  someString.match( new RegExp('[a-z]', 'ig') )   gets you an array of matches
[16:44:57] <shoky> then you can set the world on fire
[16:45:02] <TelFiRE> well that's just fantastic, the same code that works on a million other sites doesn't work, and for whatever reason jsfiddle and jsbin are both totally hosed right now and mangling the crap out of my html before the js even comes into play

[16:45:32] <joikus> thx
[16:49:52] <itatitat> guys, when you use getJSON, the method is always get no?, but....is there any postJSON?
[16:50:53] <klocatelli> ajax + parse?
[16:51:13] <klocatelli> not same, but might work for your needs
[16:52:00] <itatitat> Im new with json, Im looking for something basic with json
[16:53:37] <notjames> ok, question...
[16:54:15] <notjames> http://jsfiddle.net/xSQBw/ demonstrates my question. I'd like it so that when I drag, the parent from where the box that is being dragged gets droppable disabled.
[16:54:25] <shoky> itatitat: use $.ajax
[16:54:42] <itatitat> ou, yes....good idea
[16:54:42] <itatitat> thanks
[16:54:59] <notjames> but I can't find the way to do that. I tried using the start: and stop: methods for draggable but its quite convoluted and I don't think I'm doing that right...nor does it work.
[16:55:00] <shoky> itatitat: and if you set dataType to 'json' then the returned data will automatically be parsed and you'll just get the object
[16:55:11] <shoky> itatitat: which is exactly what $.getJSON does
[16:56:02] <itatitat> aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!; yes!; I want that.....yeah, so with that my data turn into objet jquery no?
[16:56:14] <itatitat> perfect
[16:58:26] <BFranks> Hmmm when I use tablesorter http://tablesorter.com/docs/ on a table with html5 date inputs (<input type="date" class="datebox" value="2012-08-13" id="db1" >) it sorts them by 'id' not by 'value' .. anyone else found this issue?
[17:02:16] <BFranks> Oh.. wait.. looks like I should just use jQuery UI's datepicker.. ;p
[17:02:55] <imachuchu> I'm having a simple problem with the jquery-ui autocompleter, most likely with pulling the data from an ajax call: http://jsfiddle.net/TdwjZ/
[17:04:08] <coldhead> imachuchu: are you sure that url for the data source is right? it doesn't maybe need a leading / or something?
[17:05:02] <imachuchu> coldhead: not sure, I can try. Like I said the base ".autocomplete({" call works just fine, but I need to also pass some parameters with the post
[17:05:54] <itatitat> and if I made post with json in the end, I need to encode the data with json_enconde from my file .php (this file acces to the DB and return values)??
[17:06:09] <kevinquinnyo> i'm running this on a site via firebug console, but wondering if anyone knows why the loop dies after the first regex match:  http://pastebin.ca/2174726
[17:06:13] <imachuchu> coldhead: nope it's not needed/won't work with it
[17:06:35] <coldhead> damn, i was hoping it would be that simple :(
[17:07:24] <imachuchu> coldhead: (actually works worse, with that change firebug is saying it gets a 404, while before hand it was actually getting the response just not opening the dialog)
[17:07:40] <imachuchu> well I'll start git-bisecting it
[17:08:32] <coldhead> imachuchu: i don't think you can make an async call to get the data like that
[17:08:48] <shoky> notjames: use the 'accept' option of the droppable, passing a function
[17:08:56] <coldhead> like the second form that you say works doesn't have a separate ajax call
[17:09:08] <coldhead> so i imagine you want to find a way to provide params to that working form
[17:09:11] <coldhead> which i bet works
[17:09:14] <teear> 123
[17:09:16] <coldhead> and is possible
[17:09:18] <coldhead> somehow
[17:09:42] <imachuchu> coldhead: here's a bit of an example of using ajax with autocomplete: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[17:10:12] <fatmandown> can someone tell me why this script isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/tEKha/
[17:10:33] <fatmandown> It's pretty simple but I can't seem to get the option:selected as a text value for comparison
[17:10:36] <shoky> notjames for example: http://jsfiddle.net/xSQBw/1/
[17:10:54] <teear> The Script is not working because there is a fat man down
[17:11:07] <imachuchu> coldhead: and I would use .get, but you can't pass parameters to it (but getJSON...)
[17:11:15] <coldhead> imachuchu: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-autocomplete-passing-additional-parameters
[17:11:29] <notjames> shoky: thanks! Checking. brb.
[17:11:33] <coldhead> that links to the same docs but has a little more exegesis
[17:11:42] <BFranks> imachuchu: I had the same damn issue.. took me forever to get the loaded data into the auto-complete 'happily' was something to do with object data vs. array? I promptly lost the HDD I was testing on and never went back to autocomplete.. ;P
[17:12:10] <teear> Theresa fatmandown
[17:12:22] <imachuchu> BFranks: autocomplete looks so good, and is so finicky (try cloning with it, *kaboom*)
[17:12:37] <BFranks> Always worked when I'd feed it a preloaded string.. but when I tried to build the data on the fly it was a cow.. :)
[17:12:37] <imachuchu> coldhead: thanks, looking at it now
[17:13:18] <coldhead> imachuchu: bug ajpiano if you can't get it working, he's some kind of Mr Autocomplete
[17:13:21] <shoky> fatmandown:  $("#location").change(changeLoc);
[17:13:23] <teear> fatmandown yeer a healthy little scottish fella aren't ya?

[17:14:04] <kevinquinnyo> http://pastebin.ca/2174726  <-- can someone help me figure this out, loop dies on first match
[17:14:25] <kevinquinnyo> i know you dont have the code it acts on, but it's a loop control problem i'm sure
[17:14:25] <At0n> as there any way using javascript that a css file can be written to?
[17:14:34] <imachuchu> coldhead: he helped me with my clone problem yesterday (his answer, rightfully don't do it, but I finally got it to work, Mwahhahahahahaha!)
[17:14:35] <fatmandown> shoky: that's weird. it was half-working, all because of the parentheses? either way, thank you
[17:14:57] <shoky> fatmandown: yes, because you were calling changeLoc instead of passing a reference to it
[17:15:12] <DarwinSurvivor> Does anyone know for sure if the jquery color picker has been abandoned? If so I'll look into alternatives later.
[17:15:27] <teear> If I were a fatman I would be down
[17:15:31] <DarwinSurvivor> * jquery-ui color picker
[17:16:26] <teear> Many fatman down dozens still to go, it's the gamification, all around us is a game
[17:17:10] <teear> Games are fun no more, theres too much games in teh intternets
[17:17:35] <teear> Stackoverflow = gamified
[17:17:52] <teear> Lovelesbianhotporn.com = gamified
[17:18:02] <teear> Where's the sites with no games
[17:19:27] <shoky> kevinquinnyo: match() returns null if there's no match
[17:20:12] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: i know, that's why the if () {} works
[17:20:14] <notjames> shoky, you are the man! Thank you for your help!
[17:20:19] <kevinquinnyo> why does it kill the .each()
[17:20:46] <shoky> kevinquinnyo: you are calling .length on null
[17:20:55] <imachuchu> coldhead: so it looks like the problem (according to the article you linked me at least) is that I'm don't have a "success" clause for the ajax call. What would be the correct syntax to say "just return the darn thing response"
[17:21:03] <teear> My penguin got lost, notjames can you help yelp?
[17:21:23] <imachuchu> coldhead: and no "success: function(data) {return data;}
[17:21:34] <imachuchu> does not work

[17:26:41] <coldhead> i'm insufficiently familiar with autocomplete sorry imachuchu
[17:26:59] <danzik17> imachuchu: see ?pipe
[17:26:59] <bot-t> imachuchu, deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[17:27:56] <danzik17> imachuchu: actually, scratch that.  just return the ajax call and use ?done
[17:27:57] <bot-t> imachuchu, deferred.done(doneCallbacks, [doneCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[17:28:30] <imachuchu> danzik17: never heard of it, reading now
[17:29:39] <joikus> is there a way not to show chrome's silly preview print window, and have it use the default print dialog?
[17:31:04] <joikus> I use var w = window.open(..);  w.focus(); w.print();
[17:31:19] <shoky> doubts
[17:43:20] <imachuchu> danzik17: I'm not sure how? attach done on the ajax call?
[17:44:23] <textchimp> hi, i  have a page with some draggable images, using the stop event for one kind of handling, and some droppable target elements, using the drop event for differemt handling. but the stop event seems to prevent the droppable drop event from firing. is this a known thing?
[17:46:10] <danzik17> imachuchu: do you have a jsfiddle example of what you're trying to do?
[17:46:41] <imachuchu> danzik17: yoink: http://jsfiddle.net/TdwjZ/
[17:47:13] <imachuchu> danzik17: it isn't a working fiddle (what with the ajax call and such) but the codes fairly concise
[17:49:33] <shoky> imachuchu:  $.ajax(...).done(function(data) { response( data.theArrayField ) });
[17:49:48] <imachuchu> shoky: I'll give it a shot
[17:49:55] <danzik17> imachuchu: what shoky said.  the corresponding doc page is here:  http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[17:50:10] <imachuchu> danzik17: yeah that page is... complex...
[17:50:23] <textchimp> do i need in the draggable stop event to somehow bubble the event up to the droppable drop event manually?
[17:53:21] <shoky> textchimp: nope
[18:01:49] <shoky> textchimp: btw, the drop event happens _before_ the stop event
[18:02:45] <textchimp> shoky, ok thanks. i don't know why it's not triggering, i've done $('#target-id *').droppable() just to be sure, but it's not firing, though the draggable stop even always is
[18:03:09] <teear> buyakatscha
[18:05:07] <shoky> textchimp: donno, but here's an example where it works fine- http://jsfiddle.net/xSQBw/2/
[18:06:50] <bobdobbs> dumb noob question time. I'm defining two variables: http://paste2.org/p/2083171
[18:07:27] <bobdobbs> It might be a dumb idea, but could I make the second variable definition more efficient, by somehow using the variable 'contactForm' ?
[18:07:41] <shoky> bobdobbs: var contactForm = $('#contact-form'), button = contactForm.find('button');
[18:08:05] <bobdobbs> 'find'. cool.
[18:08:07] <bobdobbs> thanks
[18:10:09] <bobdobbs> shoky: I've just been writing small, light scripts. The solution you've given me... is that kind of thing used to create efficiencies in actual applications?
[18:10:39] <bobdobbs> I'm asking cos I'm pretty clueless when it comes to anything more then really basic js scripting.
[18:11:35] <shoky> bobdobbs: yes that's very common, and efficient
[18:11:50] <bobdobbs> Cool. Thanks :)
[18:11:57] <shoky> ;]
[18:13:21] <imachuchu> I doubt anyone cares, but I fixed my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/TdwjZ/2/
[18:13:36] <imachuchu> thank you shoky danzik17 and coldhead
[18:13:51] <imachuchu> but not BFranks, cause he was right from the beginning ;)
[18:13:52] <coldhead> hey good going, imachuchu !
[18:14:44] <imachuchu> coldhead: yeah, had to mess around with map and the ajax success method (it also helps to sanity test to make sure that the ajax is *actually* returning correctly)
[18:17:06] <shoky> good jerb
[18:17:57] <defaultro> Has anyone of you attended training from TrainingConnection.com?
[18:18:00] <shoky> imachuchu: i'd remove that trailing comma after minLength: 4
[18:18:20] <shoky> imachuchu: or someday some loser with IE7 or smth will say you suck
[18:19:39] <imachuchu> shoky: well if someone comes over with ie7, tough noogies
[18:19:49] <beancurd> oop
[18:19:53] <imachuchu> shoky: but yeah, I'll change it now, and thank you for noticing
[18:20:14] <shoky> well, IE8 too
[18:20:32] <shoky> for poor souls on XP
[18:20:47] <shoky> that forgot to download chrome :\
[18:20:47] <ajpiano> defaultro: were you here yesterday mentioning that you were gonna do a bocoup training but you couldn't get like, funded for it or something ?
[18:21:11] <ajpiano> defaultro: if you can't leave chicago, i would get in touch with Bitovi for js training in that case
[18:21:14] <defaultro> yes, because it was in boston
[18:21:17] <ajpiano> http://bitovi.com/
[18:21:27] <ajpiano> defaultro: your company would pay for the course but not for airfare??
[18:21:29] <defaultro> cool, checking
[18:21:37] <defaultro> maybe my boss
[18:21:53] <defaultro> he doesn't want me to leave. I really dont know why
[18:22:02] <ajpiano> that's weird
[18:22:04] <imachuchu> ooh I have a story! So we have an old mac here and it's before they switched to the x86 architecture so no new OS, firefox won't work anymore, and chrome won't work and he had to do (terrible) required safety training!
[18:22:14] <ajpiano> it's 2 days that you're out of the office, donno why it matters how far from the office you are :p
[18:22:17] <imachuchu> solution: camino
[18:22:32] <defaultro> exactly, maybe he thinks that i'
[18:22:42] <defaultro> i'm going there to have some fun too
[18:22:51] <ajpiano> sounds like a charmer
[18:23:03] <defaultro> what can you say about bitovi?
[18:23:05] <shoky> jquery training is too much fun as it is!
[18:23:07] <ajpiano> are you also not allowed to have fun at night when you're at home and done with work, lol
[18:23:22] <defaultro> exactly, maybe it's really the cost
[18:23:26] <defaultro> additional airfare
[18:23:30] <ajpiano> defaultro: bitovi used to be JupiterIT, they make CanJS/JavaScript MVC and a lot of other open source projects
[18:23:38] <defaultro> k
[18:23:41] <ajpiano> and contribute to jquery, etc
[18:23:46] <defaultro> cool
[18:23:48] <ajpiano> also ralphholzmann works for them :p
[18:23:51] <shoky> ajpiano do you do live training for bocoup?
[18:24:00] <ajpiano> then again me and a bunch of other people work for bocoup
[18:24:05] <ajpiano> but if ya can't get to boston, ya can't get to boston
[18:24:30] <ajpiano> shoky: i don't do trainings at bocoup but 4 people in this channel do :p
[18:24:53] <ajpiano> maybe 5 :p
[18:24:54] <teear_> merci beaucoup
[18:24:55] <shoky> ;] what kinda stuff do you do for them? if i may ask
[18:25:07] <ajpiano> shoky: i work on client projects and do jquery things
[18:25:16] <shoky> neat
[18:25:40] <teear_> french beacoups black hat seo tactics
[18:25:48] <defaultro> so here is my programming status. I've been studying javascript in codeacademy. I'm close to the middle part. I'm in the objects topic now. If I attend Bitovi training, I am thinking to attend jquery since our application are heavily written in jquery. Do you agree that I should attend jquery training?
[18:26:08] <ajpiano> defaultro: a good training can certainly be helpful, for sure
[18:26:18] <teear_> codeyear is free and good
[18:26:18] <defaultro> k
[18:26:25] <ajpiano> good to have access to have someone who's knowledgeable and you can ask questions and is dedicated to answering them for a couple days, in person
[18:26:28] <teear_> Why yeer paying for codeacademy
[18:26:29] <ajpiano> instead of just fighting your way through the internets
[18:26:31] <ralphholzmann> afaik we do remote trainings =)
[18:26:40] <defaultro> ok
[18:27:12] <teear_> ajpiano: do you play piano?
[18:27:31] <defaultro> hey ralphholzmann :)
[18:27:37] <ajpiano> teear_: i do but i am about to kick you out of this chan :p
[18:27:42] <ralphholzmann> hey defaultro
[18:27:44] <defaultro> are you one of the instructors?
[18:27:47] <teear_> Why
[18:28:00] <ralphholzmann> i am not
[18:28:00] <ajpiano> teear_: cause your name rang a bell with me and i just read through the backlog....
[18:28:14] <teear_> If you play piano and not just your nuggets we have something in common yee bastard
[18:28:16] <defaultro> i really need to learn very soon since I am having a hard time supporting our application
[18:28:16] <ralphholzmann> not yet, at least :)
[18:28:29] <defaultro> is it in Chicago area?
[18:28:43] <ajpiano> teear_: i do
[18:28:47] <ajpiano> i made this nickname up when i was 9
[18:28:52] <ajpiano> cause i played the piano then
[18:28:54] <ajpiano> and still do
[18:28:56] <ajpiano> so yea
[18:29:06] <ralphholzmann> defaultro: we can come to you or you can come to us
[18:29:08] <teear_> That's cool
[18:29:19] <defaultro> where is the place?
[18:29:30] <teear_> Yee ar a beethoven without the wings yee bastard
[18:29:40] <defaultro> i would love to not stay in our building so i am free from calls
[18:30:23] <ralphholzmann> defaultro: would it just be yourself?
[18:30:28] <defaultro> yes
[18:30:28] <teear_> Your arse is like a justinbmeyer
[18:30:30] <ajpiano> teear_: i suppose so
[18:30:45] <ajpiano> teear_: ok now i really just have to kick you, you're clearly just kind of trolling the channel
[18:30:59] <teear_> Noo
[18:31:00] <defaultro> so it's fine with me going to your place
[18:31:34] <ajpiano> reading back through the logs it would kind of be negligent for me not to do that i supose
[18:31:35] <ajpiano> :(
[18:31:44] <ralphholzmann> justinbmeyer may be able to answer any additional questions
[18:32:11] <defaultro> ralphholzmann, is that for me?
[18:32:16] <ralphholzmann> yes defaultro
[18:32:21] <defaultro> ok
[18:32:22] <justinbmeyer> well, this is the jquery channel, so if there are questions about it, just email me at justin@bitovi.com or find us on #canjs or #donejs
[18:32:45] <defaultro> justinbmeyer, I would like to attend your jquery training
[18:32:59] <defaultro> let's pm
[18:33:02] <defaultro> is it ok?
[18:33:09] * coldhead faps
[18:33:18] <defaultro> hi coldhead
[18:33:24] <coldhead> hey guy
[18:33:33] <defaultro> coldhead is one of the guy I look up to here :)
[18:33:53] <ajpiano> he is a man truly worthy of your veneration
[18:33:54] <ralphholzmann> its impossible not to
[18:34:06] <coldhead> are you calling me tall?
[18:34:44] <ralphholzmann> dark and handsome, even
[18:37:03] * shoky faps
[18:44:41] <BinaryKitten> but how can i look up to someone who's only been doing jQuery for 1 day?
[18:46:12] * BinaryKitten ponders this riddle until she passes out asleep
[19:07:06] <Rin> hey room, I have a question about the .on() function when dealing with hidden links
[19:09:15] <Rin> .on('click', 'a', function.....) dose not seem to work if the href css is set to display: none. when or how can I access this link when it does become visible. I would like to apply this to all hidden links within the document
[19:09:16] <b-ot> Rin, memorised “css”.
[19:10:42] <Rin> my css skill is not lacking, but my jquery is. thats why I'm here
[19:11:21] <Rin> I have googled, but I am unsure of the way to apply .on() to future elements
[19:12:26] <Rin> especially when I would prefer to apply it to a complete doc, and not have to call the parent using an id or such
[19:12:58] <Rin> even a hint would be helpful at this point
[19:13:13] <goshawk> hi
[19:14:22] <mikehaas763> Hello, I've been having a really hard time with this (I am new to jquery). I am using jquery-ui autocomplete. It works. However I also need to set another field (productId) to the id in the json object. Which is [{"value":"aProduct","productid":"10454"}]. Can someone summarize what I need to do to do this?
[19:15:22] <goshawk> i'm looking for a good carousel, maybe in html5 . There are hundreds of tools around but only something like this fit my needs : http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/02/06/3d-gallery-with-css3-and-jquery/ does anybody have other favorite galleries/carousel ?
[19:15:41] <mikehaas763> So for example when they select aProduct, that fields contents become aProduct, but also a hidden field called productId becomes 10454
[19:17:35] <Rin> would there be another jquery channel better suited to my question?
[19:20:15] <Ernston> hi, does anyone know of a decent countdown timer
[19:22:03] <mikehaas763> I'm confused how there are hundreds of people in this channel but no one is really on
[19:22:52] <Ernston> very misleading isnt it :(
[19:23:06] <imsky> abjorn, yo yo yo
[19:23:10] <beancurd> we're hiding.
[19:23:16] <imsky> i'll hide you yet
[19:23:27] <mikehaas763> figures :/
[19:23:38] <beancurd> hide me harder baby.
[19:23:59] <mikehaas763> hey who knew the channel could go PG
[19:24:09] <abjorn> SUP IMSKY
[19:24:26] <imsky> sop sop
[19:24:54] <abjorn> just got home
[19:24:55] <abjorn> i was like
[19:24:59] <abjorn> "fuck this noise" and left work
[19:25:09] <abjorn> except now i dont have anything to do
[19:25:30] <imsky> you left work at 10 pm?
[19:25:45] <Rin> is it possible to apply the on('click') within a hover of the parent?
[19:25:55] <abjorn> yeah
[19:26:00] <abjorn> I mean, I got there at 1
[19:26:02] <abjorn> so
[19:26:14] <imsky> lol wat
[19:26:25] <abjorn> wut?
[19:26:25] <b-ot> Detect of current browser like server's method
[19:26:34] <abjorn> wut
[19:26:34] <b-ot> Looking at the current offerings it's not very to do better. Ugh.
[19:26:35] <imsky> who goes to work 1-9pm
[19:26:37] <abjorn> wut
[19:26:38] <imsky> 1-10 pm
[19:26:39] <b-ot> Looking at the current offerings it's not very to do better. Ugh.
[19:26:45] <abjorn> wut
[19:26:45] <b-ot> I do believe that everything in the article does in fact still quality as writing JSON.
[19:26:52] <imsky> you're working security guard hours abjorn
[19:26:55] <abjorn> ...anyways
[19:26:58] <abjorn> well
[19:27:01] <abjorn> it varies
[19:27:07] <abjorn> that's just when i happened to get in today
[19:27:16] <Ernston> hi, does anyone know of a decent countdown timer ?
[19:27:18] <itatitat> guys!, i dont know if Im using fine json, I've a very simple code, is this http://snipt.org/vsfi6#expand
[19:27:31] <abjorn> i work programmer hours, sir, also known as "whenever the fuck i feel like it"
[19:27:41] <itatitat> something is not working fine.......but I wont to make sure of the main concepts are fine
[19:28:04] <Rin> abjorn - I with you on that
[19:28:14] <imsky> abjorn, lol if it's sitting in an office somewhere, 9 to 5 is a good standard
[19:28:26] <imsky> 1-10 pm = you're missing the world's evening
[19:28:30] <abjorn> but that's so eeeaarlly in the moornniiinggg
[19:28:36] <imsky> lol you bum
[19:28:49] <abjorn> i caught it from my coworkers
[19:28:51] <imsky> go to bed at 12 am, wake up at 745, good 2 go
[19:28:54] <abjorn> they all work nights
[19:28:59] <itatitat> sometone can tell me something about how I use json in the callback?
[19:29:00] <itatitat> http://snipt.org/vsfi6#expand
[19:29:05] <abjorn> most of them get there between 11 and 1
[19:29:06] <mikehaas763> Does anyone have an example of setting the value of two fields using jquery UI autocomplete? For example, I have a product field autocomplete that works, but I want to also assign the productid to another field based on the selection in product. Any examples or tutorials of this?
[19:30:11] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: do you need an example or will a description of what you have to do work ;)
[19:30:39] <mikehaas763> you can try a description! I'll see if I understand it thanks
[19:30:54] <itatitat> is a very simple code......but something is not fine....
[19:31:01] <Rin> so can anyone help me figure out how to bind to hidden elements with the .on('click') or am I way off
[19:31:05] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: there is a select callback that fires when you choose an item
[19:31:13] <abjorn> imsky: But yeah, that plugin you showed me is pretty cool. Has a jquery ui dependency which is kinda "meeehhhhhh" but I can live with it considering the project is already using jquery ui...though i have been trying to get rid of it little by little
[19:31:13] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-select
[19:31:38] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: inside of that callback there is an item called ui, inside of there you'll be able to find the current value
[19:31:45] <ajpiano> and then you just plop that value into another element
[19:31:55] <ajpiano> Rin: applying handlers to hidden elements works with .on
[19:32:00] <imsky> abjorn, ok, all css for you then: http://www.imaputz.com/cssStuff/bigFourVersion.html
[19:32:06] <ajpiano> if it isn't you are likely doing something wrong and we'd need to see an example of the code you are using
[19:32:10] <Rin> its not working in may case, strange
[19:32:49] <mikehaas763> ajpiano, will the following json work with the description you just gave me? [{"value":"aProduct","productid":"10454"}]
[19:32:54] <tw2113> how can you click on something hidden rin?
[19:33:03] <imsky> use your magic power
[19:33:24] <ajpiano> you mean, as the data source?
[19:33:30] <mikehaas763> yes
[19:33:37] <ajpiano> it can be made to work
[19:33:37] <Rin> I do use magic powers, css. when I hover over the parent they automagically display
[19:33:43] <mikehaas763> well thats what the url string datasource gives back
[19:33:54] <abjorn> Oh, so you don't have real magic powers, Rin?
[19:33:56] <abjorn> Me and imsky do
[19:33:58] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: look at this demo http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[19:34:02] <Rin> no, lol
[19:34:03] * imsky wiggles
[19:34:07] * abjorn wiggles
[19:34:14] <ajpiano> it shows how to have custom data in the data and display it, also how to put random pieces of the data random places in the dom
[19:34:18] <imsky> cause i'm a wiggle brotha, a wiggle brotha
[19:34:23] <abjorn> ^
[19:34:52] <Rin> odd that the .on('click... is working on all other links
[19:35:53] <Rin> just hidden is not working, I read that it should be. So figured I really needed someone with greater jquery experience
[19:36:16] <ajpiano> Rin: whoever that person ends up being you'll have to show them the code that is or isn't working
[19:36:23] <ajpiano> otherwise you're just telling people stories about your website
[19:36:32] <mikehaas763> ajpiano, I think you misunderstood me. What i meant was is that a good format of the datasource? For example by using the select callback like you were describing will I be able to get the "productid" value to "plop" into another element?
[19:36:47] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: yep
[19:36:48] <Rin> $(document).on('click', 'a', function(e) { ...... shouldnt this cover all links on the page
[19:36:52] <imsky> abjorn, hows the weather in balmy austin? we're hitting ass sweat at 102 F over here
[19:36:56] <Rin> will post to bin
[19:37:12] <abjorn> basically the same
[19:37:19] <abjorn> my car is a toaster oven
[19:37:21] <mikehaas763> Thanks for your help ajpiano
[19:37:22] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: in the select callback, you'd just do $("#somewhereElse").val( ui.item.productid );
[19:37:35] <ajpiano> Rin: yes
[19:37:44] <ajpiano> Rin:  it's better to use jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[19:37:48] <ajpiano> to show a working demo
[19:37:49] <imsky> OR CODEPEN
[19:37:51] <imsky> OR CODEPEN
[19:37:53] <Rin> thats what I thought, hmmm
[19:37:59] <Rin> ok, cool
[19:38:05] * imsky wants to be hip
[19:38:15] <Rin> do you prefer one or the other
[19:38:16] <abjorn> you hipster you
[19:38:23] <imsky> i only drink microbrews
[19:38:31] <imsky> that are anagrams of codepen
[19:39:29] <Rin> appreciated - ajpiano been racking my brain for a few hours. will have code up very shortly
[19:39:36] <imsky> abjorn, http://codepen.io/jnaO/pen/gwLJB
[19:39:57] <imsky> his only javascript is adding css classes
[19:40:44] <itatitat> http://snipt.org/vsfi6#expand
[19:41:07] <abjorn> ..werd
[19:41:11] <abjorn> wait
[19:41:11] <imsky> lol oh god for loops in css
[19:41:11] <abjorn> what
[19:41:12] <abjorn> why
[19:41:20] <imsky> HAML AND SASS SKILLS
[19:41:22] <imsky> VERY IN DEMAND
[19:41:41] <abjorn> why is
[19:41:43] <abjorn> ugh
[19:41:46] <abjorn> wergwtregweprguwnergwe
[19:41:52] <imsky> yeah it's sinking in
[19:41:53] <abjorn> mixins and shit
[19:41:54] <abjorn> thats one thing
[19:41:55] <abjorn> but
[19:41:59] <abjorn> LOOPS?
[19:42:02] <abjorn> CONTROL STRUCTURES?
[19:42:07] <imsky> and he uses jquery to add a class
[19:42:16] <imsky> and he does it inefficiently
[19:42:21] <Rin> never used jsfiddle, give me a couple so I know how to link you to it
[19:42:29] <abjorn> imsky: stupid
[19:42:36] <ajpiano> rin you just save and then you give us the url
[19:42:40] <imsky> abjorn, lol get ready for your boss to come in any day
[19:42:44] <Rin> sweet
[19:42:46] <imsky> I NEED CIRCLES DRAWN IN SASS
[19:42:52] <Rin> I will remember this onw
[19:42:54] <abjorn> he'd have to know what sass is
[19:42:56] <imsky> DO IT OR YOU'RE FIRED, YOU OLD FUCK
[19:43:12] <abjorn> he'd also have to know absolutely anything about front-end devving
[19:43:23] <imsky> he'll just go to codepen's front page
[19:43:35] <abjorn> he'd also have to know about anything current
[19:43:36] <abjorn> at all
[19:43:49] <imsky> https://github.com/jnaO
[19:43:55] <imsky> ^ guy who wrote the sass for loops
[19:44:14] <mikehaas763> Question about ui autocomplete. On the server side,nothing matches the filter, but I still want the user to be able to type something in, what would be a good thing to return to the ajax call?
[19:44:22] <mikehaas763> *respond to the ajax call
[19:44:34] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: that's how autocomplete works
[19:44:34] <Brooke> I'm the sassmaster.
[19:44:35] <imsky> lol sometimes i wonder about the current generation of web designers
[19:44:39] <abjorn> imsky: https://github.com/jnaO/virtual-host cause that wasn't easy enough already
[19:44:39] <ajpiano> they get to keep typing if nothing matches
[19:44:50] <imsky> they're kinda smacking of that flash, '99-'00 cluelessness
[19:45:04] <imsky> IT'S YOUR PROBLEM IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU GODDAMN DINOSAUR
[19:45:10] <imsky> abjorn, http://jnao.me/
[19:45:25] <imsky> lol both of his type whatevers fail in my brand new firefox
[19:45:42] <mikehaas763> ah I see I have a lot to learn
[19:45:44] <imsky> chroam works
[19:46:01] <imsky> lol it's some type-mask bullshit and a slider
[19:46:10] <abjorn> test in one browser only, YEEEAAH
[19:46:17] <imsky> well what else can you expect from a guy who writes for loops in his css
[19:46:31] <abjorn> lol
[19:46:52] <imsky> with a custom scrollbar oh my
[19:47:00] <imsky> i remember when you could do that with ie
[19:47:04] <imsky> good times
[19:47:06] <databack> CSS for loops?
[19:47:18] <imsky> databack, why you want some?
[19:47:24] <databack> hell yeah
[19:47:31] <imsky> find a new career
[19:47:47] <Rin> I'm going to write a simple version, so I can figure it out once its working
[19:48:16] <imsky> abjorn, i don't think this guy tested in chrome
[19:48:27] <databack> Eh, say what you want, but it'd be hella easy to animate with CSS if it had for loops
[19:48:28] <imsky> like many so kewl designers, he tested it in trusty safari 5
[19:48:46] <imsky> databack, yeah css transitions are like...not even a thing
[19:49:00] <Rin> safari is going to be the next ie headache
[19:49:06] <imsky> it already is
[19:49:16] <imsky> half of the cool sites look hilariously shitty in firefox/ie
[19:49:34] <imsky> NOT MY FAULT YOU DONT OWN A MAC, YOU JEALOUS POOR HICKS
[19:49:38] <databack> for(i = 0; i> 900px; i++){width =i}
[19:49:48] <databack> bam, im rolling with this
[19:49:54] <imsky> gl with that
[19:50:09] <abjorn> except that's not how a declarative language works
[19:50:17] <databack> Isn't an HTML page just an object?
[19:50:21] <Rin> ya, atleast micro**** finally figured out they dont control the standards, mac think they can now wtf
[19:50:49] <abjorn> I don't see how apple is trying to create web standards
[19:50:57] <abjorn> I see more standards-pushing coming from google
[19:51:13] <Rin> yes, I cant argue with that
[19:51:26] <imsky> lol lets be srs
[19:51:32] <imsky> apple created the current ecosystem
[19:51:39] <Rin> but safari is breaking lots on shit that is years old
[19:51:41] <imsky> google just had a commercial interest in supporting it
[19:51:55] <abjorn> I have a commercial interest in YOUR MOM
[19:52:01] <abjorn> buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrn
[19:52:15] <imsky> lol
[19:52:17] <abjorn> sorry, I just felt like middle school'ing right now
[19:52:23] <imsky> np bro get it out your system
[19:52:53] <coldhead> >: |
[19:53:02] <imsky> html5 hipsters that only test on safari are my bane
[19:53:11] <imsky> they work in my industry so eh, but they suck at their job, so neh
[19:53:57] <fission6> is there a more stylish version of chosen.js
[19:54:03] <tw2113> i'm getting an Air soon, and i'm still going to be using non-safari browsers as my primary tools
[19:54:13] <databack> Designers and their Apples
[19:54:15] <imsky> as you should
[19:54:17] <databack> And tight jeans
[19:54:24] <databack> and Coldplay albums
[19:54:30] <imsky> safari's got like...5% market share
[19:54:30] <tw2113> fuck coldplay
[19:54:33] <tw2113> they suck balls
[19:54:48] <imsky> no wait, 4.7
[19:54:53] <fission6> is chosen.js the way to go?
[19:55:48] <databack> Next thing you know, people will be promoting the use of JavaScript on servers
[19:55:52] <abjorn> coldhead: y the cold face
[19:56:02] <imsky> abjorn, http://codepen.io/bruceape/pen/cLvbj this cool
[19:56:12] <fission6> no recommendations
[19:56:16] <abjorn> neato
[19:56:56] <databack> CSS batman
[19:57:39] <databack> would be much easier with a for loop
[19:57:57] <imsky> 5/10 troll, would read again
[19:58:48] <abjorn> 2/10 troll, would ignore again
[19:58:59] <abjorn> imsky: https://twitter.com/ryah/status/228321606408228864
[19:59:00] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from ryah: New import syntax for #dartlang is horrible.  "import 'foo.dart' as foo &amp; export;" An ampersand - is this a joke? http://t.co/lNgqulCv ★ http://bit.ly/Pquea8
[19:59:16] <imsky> olololol
[19:59:23] <imsky> this is why after years of deliberation
[19:59:25] <abjorn> darts so great guise
[19:59:29] <imsky> i decided to ignore the bleeding edge
[19:59:31] <imsky> and learn c++
[19:59:40] <imsky> YEARS
[19:59:40] <Rin> ajpiano simple version: http://jsfiddle.net/nN62B/
[19:59:48] <abjorn> I started with dat shit
[19:59:52] <abjorn> it's fun to go back to it sometimes
[19:59:56] <imsky> lol yeah make me a calculator bozo
[20:00:00] <abjorn> you feel like a real pro
[20:00:01] <Rin> hope I didnt miss anything stripping it down
[20:00:07] <imsky> abjorn, >:|
[20:00:13] <imsky> your stupid browser's programmed in it
[20:00:20] <abjorn> ?
[20:00:23] <imsky> it's not some valhalla language
[20:00:34] <abjorn> I didn't
[20:00:36] <abjorn> even say anything bad
[20:00:37] <abjorn> wtf
[20:00:51] <imsky> yeah but "fun to go back sometimes"
[20:01:00] <imsky> like it's a journey to g++
[20:01:25] <ajpiano> Rin: you don't need to include <script> in the javascript area http://jsfiddle.net/nN62B/1/
[20:01:27] <abjorn> lol
[20:01:41] <imsky> abjorn, did you ever learn dat clojure?
[20:01:43] <Rin> yeah, I miss some other shit too
[20:01:47] <ajpiano> Rin: i'd need to see something where the behaviour of the handler not working is duplicated
[20:01:47] <abjorn> just for me, its fun when I decide to do something in it
[20:01:56] <abjorn> cause i obviously dont use it for work so its not a regular thing
[20:02:01] <abjorn> imsky: noep
[20:02:02] <ajpiano> Rin:  your ajax won't work here either because it's on jsfiddle not your site obviously
[20:02:08] <imsky> abjorn, i have no choice in cpp matter, writing a bunch of networking code the rest of the year in it
[20:02:09] <abjorn> I was looking at rust a little bit earlier this week
[20:02:13] <abjorn> then i got bored
[20:02:19] <Rin> yeah, I'm fixing it. lol
[20:02:24] <abjorn> imsky: yeah
[20:02:24] <imsky> IM GONNA DEVALOP STACK FRAMES MANG
[20:02:27] <abjorn> dat networkan
[20:02:34] <imsky> also 802.11 protocols
[20:02:36] <Rin> I also forgot to add the hover css
[20:03:04] <ajpiano> Rin: the hover css ostensibly is relatively immaterial to this situation
[20:03:26] <imsky> abjorn, lol that video has them typing dart source in notepad
[20:03:28] <Rin> good way to put it
[20:03:32] <Rin> lol
[20:03:33] <abjorn> lol
[20:03:38] <imsky> like sergey brin wearing crocs on stage
[20:03:39] <imsky> jesus christ
[20:03:44] <abjorn> REAL PROGRAMMERS USE NOTEPAD
[20:03:49] <imsky> real shitty programmers
[20:03:50] <abjorn> sup brodingo
[20:04:07] <Brodingo> playin battlefield
[20:04:14] <abjorn> WERD
[20:04:15] <databack>  Wouldn
[20:04:27] <databack> Programmers who cant use Visual Studio use Notepad
[20:04:29] <Rin> you get the idea of what I was trying though
[20:04:40] <abjorn> wut
[20:04:40] <b-ot> Hy just wondering if you had ever made any images with those tick boxes i.e portrait would look great.
[20:04:42] <databack> But would HTML be considerably more dynamic if it was written in dot notation as an object should be
[20:04:54] <abjorn> ._.
[20:05:00] <abjorn> that's
[20:05:03] <abjorn> not how markup works
[20:05:10] <databack> It doesn't matter how markup works
[20:05:21] <abjorn> well in this case it does
[20:05:22] <databack> The bottom line is that you are defining attributes of an object
[20:05:34] <databack> How that text is interpretted is irrelevant
[20:05:35] <imsky> IN DOT NOTATION
[20:05:38] <imsky> IN DOT NOTATION
[20:05:42] <abjorn> only at an implementation level, databack
[20:05:45] <databack> I didn't mispell
[20:05:53] <imsky> xpath and xquery you damn nub
[20:05:54] <abjorn> imsky lol
[20:06:00] <abjorn> ximsky
[20:06:01] <databack> Why is XML considered the ideal choice for the DOM
[20:06:01] <abjorn> xabjorn
[20:06:07] <imsky> xwiggle
[20:06:10] <abjorn> it's not, anymore
[20:06:21] <imsky> lol xml and dom
[20:06:31] <databack> Is it not
[20:06:34] <imsky> no
[20:06:43] <abjorn> no, xhtml is ded
[20:06:43] <databack> Then I dont know what web you are working with
[20:06:51] <imsky> abjorn, lolwut
[20:06:57] <databack> What are websites using these days?
[20:06:59] <imsky> dom has no tight coupling to xml/html
[20:07:02] <abjorn> imsky: I'm assuming that's what he was referring to
[20:07:17] <databack> I think that is what you are referring too
[20:07:18] <imsky> abjorn, "The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents.["
[20:07:20] <imsky> >:|
[20:07:32] <databack> What I am suggesting is that there is a better way to manipulate the document object model than CSS/HTML
[20:07:35] <imsky> get on mah level
[20:07:48] <abjorn> you manipulate the DOM with javascriptz sirz
[20:07:57] <abjorn> jaboscraptz
[20:07:58] <databack> really
[20:08:00] <imsky> jabocraps
[20:08:58] <imsky> the xml ecosystem is ridiculously advanced
[20:09:17] <imsky> just thinking about xquery, xforms and all that
[20:09:23] <abjorn> imsky: http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/post/27662679253/text-javascript-photograph-of-once-beautiful
[20:09:46] <imsky> abjorn, i dun get it
[20:09:49] <databack> There isn't much to it though...You have a hierarchy, attributes and values
[20:10:20] <abjorn> imsky: I think the implication is that javascript is dying
[20:10:30] <imsky> lol checkin out this dude's other entries
[20:10:35] <imsky> frustrated mediocre codemonkey
[20:10:41] <databack> that site is pretty good
[20:10:48] <imsky> HURR DURR I BREAK SOMETHING EVERY TIME I WRITE CODE
[20:10:57] <databack> one line fix, my ass ...lol
[20:11:07] <imsky> shit man i write for half an hour, refresh dat browser, and everything works as expected
[20:11:24] <databack> I bet you use 55 alerts to debug
[20:11:32] <imsky> ^ lol u mad
[20:12:05] <databack> "Object:Object"
[20:12:09] <databack> wtf
[20:12:35] <imsky> "who the fuck indents with tabs"
[20:12:38] <imsky> olol
[20:12:55] <codepython777> I would like to select at rendering time, CSS file that i want to render (basically i want to give the user a chance to select a theme and based on the selection, use the right CSS). Anyone has any hints on how to do this?
[20:13:17] <sente> as sad as it is, there are a couple popular python packages authored by ppl who use hard tabs
[20:13:29] <sente> always makes it pain when i first fork
[20:13:35] <imsky> it's only sad because python is just lol in general
[20:13:43] <imsky> tab indent 24/7/365, i dont want to guess your space count
[20:14:01] <sente> tabs for the loss
[20:14:01] <abjorn> codepython777: Inserting a <link> into <head> when someone chooses their stylesheet?
[20:14:02] <databack> Python is fun
[20:14:03] <sente> and python for the win
[20:14:04] <imsky> "braces go on the next line" jesus this blog is mediocrity condensed
[20:14:16] <codepython777> abjorn: what happens to the current page, does it change?
[20:14:20] <abjorn> ew, braces on the next line :(
[20:14:28] <abjorn> well yes, that's the idea, codepython777
[20:14:43] <imsky> i can just imagine the MAF "jquery programmer" that writes these things
[20:15:07] <codepython777> abjorn: so  i need to remove a link and add a new link, right?
[20:15:26] <databack> So with the Databack DOM
[20:15:38] <databack> It'd be Html.Css = "NewStyleSheet.css";
[20:15:42] <databack> Boom, new CSS
[20:15:44] <abjorn> imsky: http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/post/27725295734/text-fucking-segfaults-photograph-of-a I kinda chuckled at that one
[20:15:49] <imsky> yeah me too
[20:15:56] <imsky> only one i was like "yeah i know dat feel"
[20:16:01] <abjorn> yeah lol
[20:16:11] <imsky> everything else is just some gritted teeth java programmer at enron
[20:16:30] <abjorn> codepython777: If there's already a stylesheet you can just change the href attribute of the existing one
[20:17:02] <imsky> dont do that though
[20:17:04] <databack> I'd think attaching a style sheet via server would be a more ideal solution
[20:17:09] <imsky> if you have themes, just keep appending <links>
[20:17:16] <imsky> if they're proper themes, they'll keep cancelling out
[20:17:23] <abjorn> y imsky
[20:17:37] <codepython777> Server side is trouble, because mutiple users might be logged in at the same time?
[20:17:49] <imsky> abjorn, you can save a bunch of money on car insurance
[20:18:30] <imsky> lol backbone.js
[20:19:02] <imsky> i'm getting this collection to render and then calling it a night
[20:19:12] <databack> what difference does it make if there are multiple users?
[20:19:21] <imsky> what do you care
[20:19:25] <imsky> python lover
[20:20:19] <codepython777> databack: if i setup something on the server to render another theme
[20:20:35] <databack> imsky puts Brainfuck Programming Expert on his resume
[20:20:46] <imsky> are you trying to beef with me bro
[20:20:49] <abjorn> if only
[20:20:50] <imsky> i don't get it
[20:21:00] <abjorn> I wish I had that on my resume
[20:21:24] <databack> Did you learn Brainfuck?
[20:21:26] <imsky> abjorn, you can put whatever you want on there
[20:21:39] <abjorn> tru nuff
[20:21:55] <imsky> is there a point in backbone dev
[20:21:57] <databack> Code, well, ideally you'd save client preferences in some type of datastore then render the CSS styles they choose based upon preferences
[20:22:03] <imsky> when you stop reading tutorials and blog posts
[20:22:04] <abjorn> imsky: whatchya mean
[20:22:07] <abjorn> oh
[20:22:09] <imsky> and just go "fuck it, i know enough js"
[20:22:13] <abjorn> rofl
[20:22:17] <abjorn> there is, in fact
[20:22:47] <imsky> i just feel like i might be missing some convention or whatever...but oddly i dont care, because i'm developing "photoshop" using assembly over here
[20:23:00] <imsky> so who cares what addy osmani thinks
[20:23:18] <abjorn> just use backbone boilerplate and wing it from there
[20:23:21] <imsky> lol no
[20:23:24] <abjorn> that's what I did
[20:23:25] <imsky> no boilerplates for me sir
[20:23:28] <abjorn> worked out fine for me
[20:23:29] <imsky> i read fundamentals
[20:23:35] <imsky> which is poor quality
[20:23:37] <abjorn> I started and then
[20:23:40] <databack> backbone shipping with MVC4
[20:23:41] <abjorn> I stopped
[20:23:46] <abjorn> because I was so bored and not learning anything
[20:23:54] <imsky> it's pretty useful when you're building right now
[20:23:55] <abjorn> I'm like "yes I know what mvc is already"
[20:24:05] <imsky> backbone isn't even mvc though
[20:24:07] <imsky> god..
[20:24:13] <abjorn> i know
[20:24:14] <abjorn> tis' like
[20:24:15] <imsky> i started doing an ext js project
[20:24:16] <imsky> that's mvc
[20:24:17] <abjorn> *it's
[20:24:32] <abjorn> it tried to be mvc then gave up after half of v
[20:24:37] <databack> that's all I do is MVC
[20:24:38] <imsky> ext js is nice but it's something i could have coded, i expected world-class compactness from these people
[20:24:52] <imsky> instead it's like "hurr here's 1437423 layers of indirection, FIGURE IT OUT"
[20:25:00] <abjorn> c:
[20:25:13] <imsky> but yeah they got views down pat
[20:25:15] <imsky> and controllers
[20:25:23] <imsky> and routers..jesus ext js is nice mang
[20:25:30] <abjorn> Backbone did models then said fuck it
[20:25:34] <imsky> lol
[20:26:01] <imsky> open source is not really free
[20:26:04] <abjorn> even with models they're like "They don't need any way to track changes on composite types, right?"
[20:26:06] <imsky> now that i think about it
[20:26:12] <imsky> it costs precious googlin time
[20:26:17] <imsky> and source-readin' time
[20:26:20] <abjorn> "Surely no one will use arrays or objects as model fields"
[20:26:24] <imsky> lol yeah
[20:26:29] <imsky> actually wait wahat
[20:26:34] <imsky> i use arrays as model fields no prob
[20:26:47] <abjorn> if you just
[20:26:58] <abjorn> model.get("someArray").push("some new value")
[20:27:01] <abjorn> the model won't know it changed
[20:27:12] <imsky> well...kind of obvious, nah?
[20:27:16] <lancealtar> ?on
[20:27:17] <abjorn> of course, but
[20:27:17] <lancealtar> !on
[20:27:25] <abjorn> backbone models need an api for doing that shit so it can track it
[20:27:33] <imsky> no my friend
[20:27:41] <imsky> javascript needs dom-mutate events in every browser
[20:27:41] <abjorn> instead backbone plugins gotta do that
[20:27:46] <imsky> so backbone won't need to exist
[20:27:47] <abjorn> well
[20:27:52] <abjorn> preferably that lol
[20:27:56] <imsky> just store all your shitty data in dom and check for changes there
[20:28:10] <lancealtar> dang it, where's the bot?
[20:28:23] <imsky> lancealtar, i heard it's at bing.com
[20:28:26] <abjorn> wut
[20:28:27] <b-ot> If code right people never know it is there.
[20:28:28] <abjorn> ^ that's that one
[20:28:52] <databack> #
[20:30:02] <abjorn> $
[20:30:40] <lancealtar> imsky: bing? who uses bing?
[20:31:02] <imsky> lancealtar, u seem dumb
[20:31:15] <lancealtar> imsky: you seem trollish
[20:31:33] <imsky> diagnosis confirmed

[20:33:46] <Crimlo> engles you wetback
[20:33:50] <imsky> ^ whoa
[20:33:50] <ajpiano> imsky: abjorn sometimes i wish you guys would just pm each other :p
[20:33:51] <Crimlo> ingles**
[20:33:54] <imsky> ajpiano, we do
[20:34:02] <ajpiano> Crimlo: you on the other hand, i wish would just avoid this channel
[20:34:11] <imsky> poor crimlo
[20:34:20] <imsky> he just wanted some bros to agree with him
[20:34:30] <abjorn> shit just got real

[20:34:39] <imsky> did he mean ingles
[20:34:54] <imsky> MARX & ENGELS: POR QUE ES DIO
[20:35:05] <ajpiano> imsky: abjorn it's just that when the two of you are going on it kind of makes it very difficult for people who are trying to get help to actually get some :(
[20:35:15] <imsky> lol we're barely in this chan
[20:35:21] <imsky> databack tries to troll me
[20:35:28] <databack> Troll you
[20:35:34] <databack> Troll is not a verb, you moron
[20:35:41] <imsky> ^ lol
[20:35:52] <ajpiano> imsky: but when you are it's pretty noticiable....
[20:36:06] <ajpiano> ?offtopic trolling itself
[20:36:13] <ajpiano> damnit bot-t :(
[20:36:18] <abjorn> he died
[20:36:20] <imsky> we were talking about dom storage like 9 minutes ago
[20:36:24] <imsky> you need to be cool ajpiano
[20:36:39] <Aquaguy> Hello
[20:36:42] <coldhead> ajpiano: if neither of them ever helped anyone it would be a different story, but last week imsky did some amazing wizardry from the vaguest possible description of a problem and he's basically a god now
[20:36:42] <imsky> nobody comes here just to be offtopic
[20:36:42] <abjorn> sup
[20:36:44] <ajpiano> you realise me talking to you guys about this and not being a dick about it *is* "being cool
[20:36:49] <ajpiano> coldhead: i know
[20:36:49] <databack> i do
[20:36:51] <imsky> coldhead++
[20:37:09] <abjorn> that sup was directed at aquaguy
[20:37:13] <abjorn> WHY TO SCREW UP MY TIMING COLDHEAD
[20:37:15] <imsky> aquaman in the chan
[20:37:16] <abjorn> why? way
[20:37:18] <imsky> WHY TO GO
[20:37:54] <Aquaguy> I have a jquery object containing a xml structure. I'm trying to post that xml to the PHP server, but it doesn't seem to work. Is there any way to convert "xml" object to a string before posting it with $.post?
[20:38:27] <imsky> Aquaguy, yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyesssssssssss
[20:39:09] <abjorn> I haven't used XML in so long I don't actually remember.
[20:39:18] <imsky> you use xml every day you jerk
[20:39:24] <abjorn> well
[20:39:25] <abjorn> not like that
[20:39:41] <Aquaguy> I tried dictionary = $('<div/>').append(dictionary.clone()).html() but it changes character like < for &lt;
[20:39:48] <Aquaguy> and I dont want that effect
[20:39:56] <abjorn> so do some replace()'s
[20:40:22] <Aquaguy> kjsdb
[20:40:36] <imsky> lol why are you appending
[20:40:46] <Aquaguy> oops sorry for that, a bat just entered through the window and scared the fu** out of me
[20:40:58] <abjorn> lol
[20:41:44] <imsky> this guy's got bigger problems than xml!
[20:42:31] <abjorn> yeah like dracula
[20:43:25] <BaByJuIcE> i think dracula is not real.
[20:43:30] <imsky> Aquaguy, tbh making sure xml is correct is a pain in the butt, just send json using http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/xml-to-json/ and convert into data on php, you can then convert it to xml from php if you need
[20:43:39] <Aquaguy> using replace is kind of crappy for this, isn't there a function to replace html entities back to the original symbols?
[20:44:25] <imsky> yes
[20:44:37] <imsky> http://php.net/manual/en/function.html-entity-decode.php
[20:44:53] <Aquaguy> imsky, I already checked that plugin, it doesn't work as well as I need it to work. When a node has more than one attribute it seems to fail
[20:44:56] <abjorn> you don't say babyjuice
[20:45:16] <imsky> Aquaguy, tough to really be helpful without data mang
[20:45:24] <imsky> ALL I CAN OFFER IS POINTERS
[20:45:31] <abjorn> and references
[20:45:46] <BaByJuIcE> abjorn: that is my belief.
[20:45:54] <imsky> wonder if anyone has K&R tattooed on them
[20:46:00] <abjorn> i am offended by your belief babyjuice
[20:46:50] <BaByJuIcE> abjorn: sorry, but i don't believe in dracula.
[20:46:55] <abjorn> imsky: I do
[20:47:07] <abjorn> babyjuice: well you should...BECAUSE I AM DRACULA
[20:47:10] <imsky> yeah but is it for the C book or for the muffler company abjorn ?
[20:47:17] <abjorn> both
[20:47:18] <imsky> be honest
[20:47:26] <imsky> damn that's an efficient tattoo
[20:47:34] <abjorn> I thought so
[20:47:35] <imsky> worthy of both referents
[20:48:20] <BaByJuIcE> abjorn: Then I am really scared. That means you good at sucking.
[20:48:29] <abjorn> badumtss
[20:48:35] <imsky> BaByJuIcE, are you brazilian
[20:48:51] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: no
[20:49:05] <imsky> BaByJuIcE, ok then mexican
[20:49:11] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: no
[20:49:20] <imsky> ok then you're on /ignore now
[20:49:30] <imsky> I ONLY CARE ABOUT MY FELLOW BRAZILIANS
[20:49:36] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: ok
[20:49:48] <Rin> so, after searching further the hidden element is displayed using java after clicking the parent. would this be the cause of .on('click') not working for the hidden links?
[20:50:21] <imsky> USING JAVA
[20:50:24] <imsky> WHY THE DAY
[20:50:27] <beancurd> SO PRO
[20:50:31] <Rin> yeah, no my code
[20:51:05] <Rin> but I have to deal with it
[20:51:12] <abjorn> i know that feel, sir
[20:51:21] <imsky> abjorn, why the day is now officially sanctioned
[20:52:05] <rodd> imsky fala de onde
[20:52:05] <Rin> I am able to see the hidden links in the html, but that's not helping me here. any ideas?
[20:52:06] <abjorn> porque la dia
[20:52:16] <imsky> rodd, no habla espanol segnor
[20:52:30] <rodd> imsky thought you were brazilian
[20:52:34] <rodd> and that was portuguese
[20:52:39] <imsky> this is too easy
[20:52:41] <Rin> lol, the href="javascript://" ....seriously
[20:52:42] <abjorn> lol
[20:52:53] <abjorn> Rin: YAAAAYY
[20:53:21] <Rin> so there must be something bound to the id or class
[20:53:22] <abjorn> uhhh any way to get an example of what's going on, if you didn't already put one on jsfiddle or something, i might have missed it
[20:53:57] <Rin> its part of vbulletin so jfiddle wouldnt work
[20:55:02] <Rin> I tried to simplify it, and after taking the time to make a simple example...it worked. so what ever vb is doing is the issue
[20:55:05] <abjorn> oic
[20:55:18] <abjorn> idk, hard for me to say without seeing it in action
[20:55:25] <Rin> yeah, I know
[20:55:52] <imsky> abjorn, http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/
[20:55:58] <imsky> this is standard for mobile bros
[20:56:08] <imsky> but man...think of the desktop possibilities
[20:57:46] <Rin> if I was to add a click event to the visible parent, then inside bind the .on....maybe?
[20:58:11] <abjorn> imsky: I CAN SEE UR DOMS?
[20:58:23] <imsky> ya
[20:58:45] <abjorn> idk, when shit starts happening with java, rin, WHO KNOWS
[20:58:50] <abjorn> unless you meant javascript
[20:58:54] * imsky thinks back to the vid of steve jobs unveiling cinema displays
[20:58:54] <abjorn> then i do know
[20:58:59] <Rin> think I need a beer before I go and kill the vb dev's
[20:59:05] <abjorn> do it
[20:59:11] <imsky> *crowd laughs at the size of a geforce* steve: yeah i know
[21:00:22] <Rin> before I start hacking around, is it possible to place a .on inside of a click event?
[21:00:33] <Rin> or even a hove
[21:01:04] <abjorn> imsky: the size of a geforce, soooo the size of a radeon too?
[21:01:19] <abjorn> or...any other non-integrated gpu
[21:01:21] <Rin> I just need anything that will notice once the links are no longer hidden
[21:01:25] <imsky> abjorn, this was in 2005 i think, when the new big-ass dispalys came out
[21:01:33] <imsky> and you had to have dual-head to run one
[21:01:41] <abjorn> lol
[21:01:51] <imsky> apple uses brands indiscriminately, one year it's geforce, next it's radeon
[21:01:54] <imsky> but that vid man
[21:02:01] <imsky> steve: we used to dream about this stuff
[21:02:18] <imsky> kinda cool breh
[21:03:01] <jayant> want to start JQM do i need prior knowledge of Jquery ?
[21:03:50] <BaByJuIcE> JQM is Java Quantum Machanics?
[21:03:57] <imsky> ^ leave
[21:04:04] <jayant> lol jquerymobile
[21:04:16] <BaByJuIcE> ah
[21:04:33] <imsky> abjorn, 2004
[21:04:38] <imsky> wwdc 04
[21:04:45] <Rin> is .watch a bad idea?
[21:04:46] <imsky> 2560x1600 lcd, first one
[21:05:09] <imsky> i don't even have that in 2012
[21:05:12] * imsky so ashamed
[21:05:30] <imsky> $3299
[21:08:06] <abjorn> jayant: I would suggestion having knowledge of jquery beforehand
[21:08:20] <imsky> abjorn, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWQhKJE-h8Y&feature=relmfu
[21:08:35] <imsky> 30" cinema display..
[21:08:41] <jayant> abjorn: thanks, any suggestions on where to start from
[21:09:04] <Rin> anyone suggest a good way to listen/watch for css changes to an element
[21:09:15] <imsky> rin no way to do that
[21:09:21] <imsky> NONE WHATSOEVER
[21:09:29] <Rin> argh
[21:09:50] <abjorn> imsky: "No graphics card could drive this thing." ahahahaha oh man 2004
[21:09:55] <Rin> well, I'm out of ideas then. but not out of beer
[21:10:21] <imsky> abjorn, i remember i had like...some crappy geforce back then, 5600 or something
[21:10:30] <imsky> WHERE DOES THE TIME GO
[21:10:47] <abjorn> I remember when I had a 5600
[21:10:50] <tw2113> ?eval 98+176+172+176+79
[21:10:53] <abjorn> i couldnt play hl2, it made me mad
[21:10:58] <imsky> lolol
[21:11:02] <tw2113> book @ bot
[21:11:15] <abjorn> now i have a 560 gtx ti and can play all da gaems
[21:11:19] <Rin> dual gtx280m on my lappy for almost 4yrs. still happy
[21:11:21] <imsky> nvidia geforce, $599
[21:11:22] <tw2113> boo even
[21:11:31] <imsky> 6800 ultra
[21:11:37] <abjorn> lol
[21:11:50] <Rin> but it weights almost 15lbs, lol
[21:11:52] <imsky> $10 on ebay
[21:12:02] <imsky> a decent one, $70
[21:12:04] <imsky> damn
[21:12:08] <imsky> that is longevity
[21:12:29] <Rin> been looking around lately though
[21:12:41] <imsky> rin you got dual gtx 280s? enjoy frying eggs on that bastard
[21:12:48] <abjorn> lol
[21:13:02] <abjorn> 560 gtx ti is my favorite card on the market atm
[21:13:09] <abjorn> not the most powerful obv, but best value for money
[21:13:10] <Rin> oh yeah, in the summer with out ac it over heats on wow with max settings
[21:13:13] <imsky> abjorn, 550 breh
[21:13:22] <abjorn> nah, 560 ti
[21:13:28] * imsky has 550 ti >:|
[21:13:35] <imsky> FOLLOW ALONG HERE
[21:13:47] <abjorn> c:
[21:13:52] <Rin> get about 10-20min bat time, lol
[21:13:53] <abjorn> we're almost gpu buddies
[21:13:59] <imsky> almost!
[21:14:16] <abjorn> it's a surprising leap up in performance between the 550 ti and 560 ti, though, last i checked
[21:14:19] <Rin> was the shit 2008-09
[21:14:23] <abjorn> and the price isn't that different
[21:14:41] <imsky> yeah amost double
[21:14:47] <imsky> price is about..50% higher
[21:14:52] <shoky> <3 560 gtx ti
[21:15:08] <abjorn> hmm, maybe the 550 price went down since i bought my 560 lol
[21:15:21] <imsky> my next card hasn't come out yet
[21:15:31] <imsky> will be maybe 2-3 years before it does
[21:15:39] <abjorn> it's been awhile since i got mine, i think the 560 hasnt gone down in price because its so popular, so thats probs why
[21:15:58] <Rin> hey if you can make the $$ why not
[21:16:10] <imsky> because it's obsolete the moment you buy it
[21:16:17] <Rin> ya
[21:16:23] <rodd> what am I missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/zLKe4/
[21:16:24] <abjorn> well, it's probably nvidia's most popular card right now
[21:16:32] <abjorn> YAY BOT-T
[21:16:35] * abjorn hugs bot-t
[21:16:40] <Rin> I mean -- if the execs -- can make the $$
[21:16:42] <imsky> ?g gtx 560 ti benchmark
[21:16:50] <imsky> u suck
[21:16:52] <abjorn> lol
[21:16:55] * bot-t hugs abjorn back
[21:16:55] <bot-t> imsky, PassMark - GeForce GTX 560 Ti - Video Card Benchmark Charts - http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce+GTX+560+Ti
[21:17:06] <abjorn> he's still waking up, it's awhile to think
[21:17:07] <imsky> NICE GOOGLING, VENTRILOQUIST
[21:17:11] <abjorn> he hasn't had his coffee yet
[21:17:21] <shoky> rodd: $.data(booya[0], 'count', (booyaCount + 1));
[21:17:25] <Rin> it takes practice
[21:17:32] <imsky> i like my card, it plays errthang
[21:17:33] <shoky> rodd: or better yet booya.data('count', booyaCount+1)
[21:18:13] <Rin> so far I have been able to play all I want.
[21:18:21] <imsky> abjorn, iirc i picked it for tdp/power reasons
[21:18:28] <abjorn> booya.data("count", booyaCount + 1) would be your best bet, like shoky said, rodd
[21:18:29] <rodd> shoky thanks, I heard $.data is faster than el.data, does that information proceeds?
[21:18:39] <shoky> it's not faster
[21:18:44] <shoky> el.data uses $.data internally
[21:18:47] <Rin> but I see the updates slowing down. just about time....
[21:18:59] <shoky> rodd: $.data is for one DOM element
[21:19:08] <imsky> abjorn, 116/170 watts, 550/560
[21:19:14] <Rin> el.data must be the mexican version
[21:19:15] <imsky> i liek my watts
[21:19:24] <abjorn> imsky: not enough on your psu?
[21:19:28] <rodd> shoky gotcha,let me try something else
[21:19:31] <rodd> haha Rin
[21:19:31] <imsky> i like to leave tons of headroom

[21:20:22] <abjorn> c:
[21:20:23] <imsky> i bought a 560w one last year
[21:20:25] <Rin> sweet
[21:20:34] <imsky> WORKIN GOOD
[21:20:35] <abjorn> the psu says it's modular but it's not :(
[21:20:36] <rodd> by using id I shouldn't need to specify the index booya[0]
[21:20:37] <abjorn> but whatever
[21:20:39] <imsky> abjorn, mine is
[21:20:43] <abjorn> nice
[21:20:46] <abjorn> thems expensive
[21:20:47] <rodd> but it doesnt seem to do it without it
[21:20:48] <imsky> it's kinda a wasted feature in a tight case
[21:20:56] <imsky> but still cool
[21:21:10] <rodd> well Ill check the source code for a better understanding
[21:21:11] <rodd> thanks
[21:21:16] * BaByJuIcE is selling Intel Pentium 4 1.66Ghz processor. Msg me in private if you want to buy.
[21:21:22] <Rin> lol
[21:21:23] <shoky> rodd: it doesnt matter if you use id or class. they both return a jquery object
[21:21:24] <abjorn> imsky: It's like half-modular. You can add on some cables on there, but it's all just additional shit, the standard connections you have on a psu are all still there and can't be disconnected
[21:21:28] <imsky> i'll get right on it BaByJuIcE
[21:21:32] <imsky> pentium 4 2.8 is like $3
[21:21:34] <rodd> shoky touche
[21:21:37] <imsky> LETS SEE WHAT DEALS YOU GOT
[21:21:43] <abjorn> I'll give you 1 bitcoin for it
[21:21:45] <imsky> abjorn, lol damn
[21:21:57] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: It's a system with 17inch CRT monitor and 256MB RAM.
[21:22:06] <Rin> awesome
[21:22:07] <abjorn> to be fair, it would take that p4 like a year to mine that one bitcoin
[21:22:11] <Rin> need it
[21:22:14] <imsky> abjorn, current price for 550 is $130, for 560 $229. i think they're the same as when i got my new gpu
[21:22:23] <abjorn> ah
[21:22:32] <abjorn> weird, guess i remembered wrong
[21:22:39] <imsky> yeah i bought a geforce for $260 once
[21:22:41] <imsky> a 5800
[21:22:44] <imsky> yeah
[21:22:49] <imsky> yeah...
[21:22:56] <abjorn> Around $200 is usually as much as I'll spend on any one part
[21:23:08] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: it's worth more then $3
[21:23:16] <imsky> BaByJuIcE, it's worth less than $1
[21:23:31] <abjorn> might as well give that p4 to a museum
[21:23:38] <Rin> yeah, we've all paid obsence amounts for hardware at one point, but it was the shit until next week
[21:23:45] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: if you be silly then i won't sell to you.

[21:24:51] * imsky has looked into old pentium chips before
[21:24:56] <Rin> the city dump has better processing power
[21:25:09] <imsky> lol shut up
[21:25:15] <Rin> lol

[21:27:42] <BaByJuIcE> imsky: $99 with monitor or $49 without
[21:27:53] <imsky> $49 sounds about right, but i can get a 2.8 ghz one for $50
[21:27:56] <imsky> no deal
[21:28:11] <imsky> monitor is useless, extract the cathode and do thangs with it
[21:28:22] <Rin> send it here I'll pay cod

[21:56:04] <codeperl> hello everyone.
[21:58:36] <codeperl> i am not an expert at jquery. but need to know. I have a dynamic form which can be larger or smaller depending on server request. this form is in a div and this div stays on a javascript variable. now i need to know the width and height of that div. How it can be possible?
[22:00:21] <codeperl> another point is the project based on legacy coding. so, the jquery lib is a little bit older. its 1.5
[22:02:12] <Forbidd3n> codeperl: http://api.jquery.com/height/ -- http://api.jquery.com/width/
[22:02:13] <fgh_> $("#id").width()
[22:02:58] <codeperl> even if the div stays at a javascript variable?
[22:03:32] <codeperl> and it has no default width and height?
[22:04:48] <fgh_> Can't get what "the div stays at a javascript variable"... if you have variable = $(something), then try variable.width(), otherwise try $(variable).width()
[22:05:56] <codeperl> ok trying.  thank you fgh_ and Forbidd3n.
[22:26:14] <samholmes> triggerHandle: Where's the extraParameters gone?
[22:26:32] <samholmes> Where does it go? function(ev) { ev.extraParameters }  ?
[22:34:48] <redgetan> anyone know how to escape strings for jQuery selectors?
[22:35:36] <fgh_> ====> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[22:36:02] <fgh_> See "If you wish to use any of the meta-characters" etc.
[22:37:14] <redgetan> cool, thanks
[22:42:09] <pneftali> guys - please check http://jsfiddle.net/SBpMT/1/ my default settings gets overwritten when i pass it to a method.
[22:49:58] <kaushik_> hi all ,
[22:50:34] <BaByJuIcE> kaushik_: hi
[22:53:10] <kaushik_> hi BaByJuIcE ,
[22:53:41] <kaushik_> do you know any library in jquery with which we can create online library
[22:53:51] <kaushik_> online editor
[22:59:59] <kaushik_> hi all does anyone know any jquery library which can be used to create an online editor ?
[23:01:45] <faraway> kaushik_: text editor or code editor ?
[23:01:54] <cubanito_nice> hi everyone
[23:07:28] <kaushik_> faraway , text editor
[23:09:43] <fgh_> then you'd probably want <div contenteditable="true">
[23:09:44] <fgh_> as in http://html5demos.com/contenteditable
[23:13:33] <joaojeronimo> Hi guys, how can I "notice" a used deleting something from an input field with backspace or delete keys ? jQuery's $(element).keypress doesn't catch these...
[23:14:13] <pneftali> try keyup
[23:15:14] <joaojeronimo> pneftali: works :) Thanks !
[23:21:13] <Daniel_35> noob has question, can anyone help?
[23:21:35] <fgh_> how can we know if you don't ask?
[23:21:56] <fgh_> :)
[23:22:05] <Daniel_35> :)
[23:22:18] <Daniel_35> first time here, not sure what is the etiquette
[23:23:26] <cubanito_nice>  he
[23:23:56] <cubanito_nice>  he he
[23:24:19] <cubanito_nice> he he
[23:27:36] <Daniel_35> ONLOAD: I iterate through all images and set a new height to them based on calculations. I need to get the height of the image parent but it keeps returning the original height and not the new one
[23:30:49] <cubanito_nice> of the image parent? $('img').parent().height() i think
[23:31:50] <Daniel_35> i tried it like this img[i].closest("li").width();
[23:32:25] <Daniel_35> sorry .height()
[23:33:05] <Daniel_35> but it returns the original height and not the new calculated height
[23:33:44] <cubanito_nice> but inside the iteration?
[23:34:00] <cubanito_nice> maybe that's the problem
[23:34:28] <Daniel_35> first each() sets the new height values
[23:35:20] <shoky> Daniel_35: jsfiddle/pastebin your code
[23:35:38] <cubanito_nice> try doing it in other each
[23:35:55] <Daniel_35> i have a second .each() that iterates over the parent of the images to check for the new heights
[23:36:04] <Daniel_35> but it returns the original value
[23:36:28] <shoky> try doing it in each other
[23:36:32] <shoky> try doing each other in
[23:36:38] <shoky> it :\
[23:37:09] <cubanito_nice> shits happens, paste your code
[23:42:38] <soee> hi, if i have link like this: #modal - can i somehow trigger it from my script ?
[23:43:00] <soee> so basicly after some operation my modal should show up
[23:43:17] <Daniel_35> http://jsfiddle.net/hg58C/1/
[23:44:57] <fgh_> soee: if I understand you correctly, javascript could check the window.location at page load
[23:45:24] <shoky> Daniel_35: your arrays are all local to that .each
[23:45:43] <shoky> Daniel_35: they start empty on each iteration
[23:48:45] <shoky> Daniel_35: you should probably use .data()
[23:49:15] <Daniel_35> hmmm
[23:49:29] <Daniel_35> need to read about it
[23:49:36] <Daniel_35> not that familiar with it
[23:50:11] <soee> fgh_, <a data-toggle="modal" href="#myModal" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Launch demo modal</a> this is how link looks like to lunch modal window
[23:50:38] <soee> now is it possible to show taht modal not by clicking on link but from inside js code somehow ?
[23:51:23] <fgh_> That link likely has a JS click handler associated
[23:51:29] <fgh_> so you could just trigger that
[23:52:07] <fgh_> I'd try with $("a.btn.btn-primary.btn-large").click()
[23:52:21] <fgh_> ... although it's quite long
[23:52:31] <fgh_> but see if that works
[23:52:33] <soee> fgh_, yes but if i dont want any button
[23:52:47] <fgh_> where did I speak of a button?
[23:52:55] <ENQ> hello
[23:53:04] <ENQ> i have a question about small plugins
[23:53:15] <ENQ> should i use prototyping in them?
[23:53:18] <soee> fgh_, a with this classess  = something like button
[23:53:39] <fgh_> ===> ?? citation needed
[23:57:04] <soee> fgh_, ok sorry for wasting your time, i figure it out, i can lunch modal by simple: $('#myModal').modal({show: 1});
[23:57:53] <godlfishh> $(this).countdown({until:rollDate, format:'YOWDHMS', significant: 2}); I use this to input countdown ticker, but I need to put div tag around it, how do I do it?
[23:59:05] <rsumi_> is there a way to hide the days table in the datepicker() for a specific datepicker() object?
[23:59:53] <su> why does alert($(document).width()) say 980px on my iPhone ...
