[00:06:44] <echofish> http://phpgolf.org/infoscreen_server/ "a is undefined"?
[00:14:47] <rabbi1> which api to use, for displaying the content of a text filed dynamically ?
[00:27:16] <mindis|wurk> hi guys. i need to implement a text input that only allows the input of integers and should have a minimum and maximum value and needs to trigger a function whenever the value changes. i tried the numeric and jstepper plugins but they both have limitations, what's the smart way to approach this?
[00:27:41] <g0rd0n> mindis|wurk: try the jquery validation plugin
[00:28:02] <mindis|wurk> does it restrict input when typing or just validate on submit?
[00:28:34] <g0rd0n> mindis|wurk: i think it validates as you type, but does not restrict
[00:28:56] <mindis|wurk> ah, that won't do then
[00:28:59] <g0rd0n> not 100% sure though
[00:30:45] <Muimi> What's up, everyone?
[00:30:54] <Muimi> Can someone tell me about 'long polling'?
[00:32:42] <coppa> automatic ajax navigation plugin, if interested fork me ;) https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-navigate
[00:32:43] <Muimi> Here's an example of something that I'm looking at: http://www.phpclasses.org/package/1-PHP-HTML-forms-generation-and-validation-.html
[00:42:07] <eshlox> $('ul.pager>li').on("click", "a", {p: $(this).attr("href")}, search); why p is always undefined?
[00:43:13] <Cork> eshlox: and this is an element where you run that line?
[00:43:46] <Cork> that is, this works => console.log($(this).attr("href")); $('ul.pager>li').on("click", "a", {p: $(this).attr("href")}, search);
[00:45:46] <eshlox> j,
[00:45:48] <eshlox> hm
[00:45:51] <eshlox> $('ul.pager>li>a').click(function(){alert($(this).attr('href'))});
[00:45:56] <eshlox> this works
[00:45:57] <eshlox> Cork: ^
[00:46:05] <Cork> thats not how data works
[00:46:12] <Cork> its evaluated when you run the bind
[00:46:15] <Cork> not on each loop
[00:46:44] <Cork> its a way to pass a context or similar to the event handler
[00:47:21] <Cork> eshlox: if you want to run it on each element do it in the event function
[00:47:52] <eshlox> i want pass attr value to search function on click
[00:48:18] <eshlox> href value is set by another function
[00:48:44] <Cork> eshlox: $('ul.pager>li').on("click", "a", function(event) { search.call(this, event, $(this).attr("href")); });
[00:49:38] <Cork> (donno event is optional, but if you want it thats how you do it)
[00:49:47] <Cork> -donno
[00:52:27] <tkr> hi. I got a link to file download. I would like to trigger an event after the download finishes (ie. refresh page). Any suggestions how to do this?
[00:52:53] <eshlox> Cork: i how get this value in function? this return "<a href="#">"
[00:53:01] <Cluber> is there a twitter bootstrap irc channel?
[00:53:36] <eshlox> Cluber: ##twitter-bootstrap
[00:53:49] <Nece228> hi
[00:53:49] <Cork> eshlox: the way i gave you
[00:53:49] <Cluber> eshlox: ty, got it
[00:54:02] <Cork> eshlox: $('ul.pager>li').on("click", "a", function(event) { search.call(this, event, $(this).attr("href")); });
[00:54:26] <Nece228> does $.getJSON perform same sending to server as $.get
[00:54:36] <Cork> eshlox: that'll give function(event, p) {}
[00:54:40] <Cork> opps
[00:54:45] <Cork> eshlox: that'll give function search(event, p) {}
[00:55:03] <Cork> Nece228: yes
[00:56:01] <Nece228> ah thanks
[00:56:12] <eshlox> Cork: i fotgot to add second parameter, thanks
[00:59:22] <Rickardo1> I want to serialize this var _params = new Array({calls: _calls, minutes: _minutes, sms: _sms, data : _data}); but it seems like I only can use serialize() on jquery object..
[00:59:40] <Rickardo1> $(_params).serialize(); don't work either
[01:00:05] <Cork> Rickardo1: JSON.stringify()
[01:00:21] <Cork> you don't serialize json you stringify it :)
[01:01:08] <Cork> Rickardo1: but is that meant to be used for ajax?
[01:01:46] <Whirl3d> Evenin' all. I have a menu that slides down on mouse over and a timer that once you mouseleave the menu, it starts counting down to slide the menu up after a delay. Mousing back over the menu resets the timer. However, if the menu is sliding up and I mouse back over it, how do I know if it is sliding up or down so that I can either stop it, or let it do it's thing...
[01:01:54] <Rickardo1> Cork: In php I have serialize(base64_encode($data));  is there something similar in JS?
[01:02:15] <Cork> Rickardo1: what is it your trying to do?
[01:03:07] <Cork> Rickardo1: php serialize is uniq to php as it builds around its memory structure
[01:03:38] <Nece228> do i need to use ajax if there is jquery?
[01:03:53] <Rickardo1> Cork: I want to pass a string to next page in a get request.. i dont want to expose the vars just an encoded string
[01:03:58] <Cork> Nece228: that question doesn't make sence
[01:04:15] <Nece228> yeah of course
[01:04:35] <Nece228> i meant to use old ajax method, or jquery method
[01:05:11] <Cork> Nece228: no $.ajax/$.get/$.post/$.getJSON is wrapper functions for the normal ajax functions
[01:05:41] <Cork> Nece228: jquery can't do anything normal js can't, its just a framework to make it simpler
[01:06:10] <Nece228> oh, ok
[01:06:13] <Nece228> i knew that
[01:06:14] <Cork> Rickardo1: well serialize it server side, and just host it as a string
[01:06:37] <Nece228> was just wondering if real men use traditional ajax method, not jquery one
[01:06:45] <Cork> lol
[01:06:57] <Cork> it depends if you load the jquery framework or not
[01:07:07] <Cork> if you load it, theres no reason not to use it
[01:07:19] <Nece228> well i guess you are right
[01:07:39] <Nece228> real men dont use any framework or template they write everything by hand
[01:07:58] <poppiez> is browsers like firefox changing code inside a <script type="text/javascript"></script> in <head></head>? I have a variable like var e={};, which gets changed to var e=, that breaks my code
[01:08:26] <Cork> poppiez: no its not modified
[01:08:35] <poppiez> Cork: really weird
[01:08:46] <Cork> poppiez: error correction has never gotten to js thank god
[01:08:56] <Cork> (wish it never got to html either)
[01:09:15] <poppiez> I'm pasting the generated code from: http://modernizr.com/download/#-backgroundsize-csstransforms-csstransforms3d-websockets-geolocation-touch-cssclasses-addtest-prefixed-teststyles-testprop-testallprops-prefixes-domprefixes to my script tag. can you confirm it?
[01:09:29] <poppiez> if I put the code inside a JS file, it works
[01:09:43] <Cork> poppiez: do you have a test link?
[01:09:55] <poppiez> I might be able to create a jsfiddle, one sec
[01:10:08] <seltar> I got an issue with slideToggle snapping/jumping on text without breaks. Made a quick fiddle so you can see what my problem is: http://jsfiddle.net/nTZNK/
[01:10:13] <Cork> poppiez: as its script tags jsbin might be better
[01:11:53] <poppiez> Cork: doesn't happen on jsbin. might be something else on my side then
[01:12:46] <seltar> anybody got an idea with my slideToggle issue? ( http://jsfiddle.net/nTZNK/ )
[01:15:10] <anli_> How do I write a function that will be called whenever I create an element with class foo?
[01:15:23] <anli_> With that or those elements as argument, is that .live?
[01:17:44] <woozly> guys, how to make text fadein?
[01:18:06] <woozly> I want to make some Change text effect
[01:18:22] <Cork> woozly: add it in an element and fade the element
[01:19:16] <woozly> Cork, but I have text in there..
[01:20:24] <Nece228> $.getJSON('json.php',{check: check}, function(data)
[01:20:29] <Nece228> will it send check variable to server?
[01:20:59] <Cork> yes
[01:21:14] <Cork> yay netsplit!
[01:21:24] <Nece228> Uncaught ReferenceError: check is not defined
[01:21:33] <Nece228> for some reason it gives me that error in browser console
[01:22:05] <Cork> Nece228: is check a variable?
[01:22:11] <Nece228> yes
[01:22:24] <Cork> thats not what the error console says :)
[01:23:57] <Hooloovoo> anyone have any ideas how i can make the jquery ui slider step less?
[01:24:31] <Nece228> $.getJSON('json.php',{check: 'check'}, function(data)
[01:24:40] <Nece228> heh i put bracket and it works now
[01:24:43] <Nece228> yay :D
[01:25:44] <Nece228> totally forgot that it is string
[01:26:44] <Cork> :)
[01:27:01] <Cork> Nece228: should prob use true instead
[01:27:15] <Cork> that would make it clearer
[01:27:24] <Nece228> you are right, i need to change
[01:28:08] <Nece228> {check: True}
[01:28:16] <Nece228> no longer works
[01:28:26] <Cork> true not True
[01:28:31] <Cork> js is case sensetive
[01:28:42] <x010100x> hello
[01:28:48] <Nece228> ah right
[01:29:01] <Nece228> i thought that true or false always starts with uppercase
[01:29:32] <Cork> Nece228: in some languages thats true, but not c like ones
[01:30:01] <Nece228> yeah, i guess i need to get used to all this hassle
[01:30:48] <Nece228> programming is so fun
[01:30:54] <Nece228> once you start you cant stop
[01:31:38] <mindis|wurk> it's fun until you run into some ridiculous css limitation and your brain implodes
[01:32:34] <Nece228> mindis|wurk: will CSS 2 help?
[01:32:58] <mindis|wurk> css2 is the problem, css3 helps slightly
[01:35:54] <Nece228> thats why its better to be programmer than web designer
[01:36:08] <catcher> Anyone recommend a plug that can convert format Y-m-d h:m:s to "10 minutes ago", etc.
[01:36:19] <mindis|wurk> Nece228 those aren't mutually exclusive :P
[01:36:24] <catcher> I see a couple, but not sure they'll work on that format.
[01:36:59] <Xotix> hi
[01:37:30] <Nece228> well then you can start programming assembler and go to st or texas instruments and will program micro chips
[01:37:43] <Nece228> there will be no limitations
[01:37:54] <Nece228> :]
[01:38:00] <Xotix> how can i do the following .css('left', '-' + (width - 55)); ? this doesn't work
[01:38:29] <caleon> try "-=" instead of -?
[01:39:15] <mindis|wurk> i don't think you need the ' around -
[01:39:31] <molavy> hi
[01:39:56] <molavy> is there any javascript library for 2d physics on query
[01:40:26] <peiper> hi does someone have a snippet for jquery .load() with error handling and all that stuff?
[01:40:54] <Cork> peiper: .load().error(function() {});
[01:40:59] <Xotix> no, it works without the âˆ’55
[01:41:04] <Cluber> is the javascript var keyword still used?
[01:41:22] <peiper> thats all 0.o thanks Cork
[01:41:23] <Cork> Cluber: uh... its the oposit
[01:41:38] <Cork> Cluber: you can make it so the script crashes without it
[01:41:48] <Cork> Cluber: you should _ALWAYS_ var your variables
[01:43:02] <heoa> I need to check a value of variable during run-time in different spots, is there some easy way for that?
[01:44:34] <Cluber> Cork: ah I see. I noticed a lot of example on the web not using the var keyword, even in jQuery itself?
[01:44:39] <eshlox>  $('ul.pager>li:not(.disabled)') this should work? ;->
[01:44:53] <Cluber> I always have used it was just wondering, thanks.
[01:45:12] <Cork> Cluber: if the variable isn't an attribute, and your not using var
[01:45:28] <Cork> Cluber: the variable you create will be on the window object
[01:45:37] <molavy> there is 2dbox js physics library but it   depend on prototype
[01:45:47] <Xotix> hmm, i don't get it, how can i do this .css('left', '-' + (width - 55)); ?
[01:45:50] <molavy> any idea?
[01:45:50] <Cork> Cluber: new_var = 'something'; is the same as window.new_var = 'something';
[01:46:22] <Cork> Xotix: you've forgot the 'px'
[01:46:33] <Cork> .css('left', '-' + (width - 55) + 'px');
[01:47:38] <Xotix> Cork already tried that. But it seems like there is some different issue then thanks
[01:48:47] <Xotix> Got it, thanks.
[01:49:55] <peiper> is .load asynchronous??
[01:50:09] <Cork> peiper: all network trafic is async
[01:50:20] <peiper> can i put an .success behind it?
[01:50:27] <Cork> sure
[01:50:31] <blackice2999> hi @all. Short Question: $('a.selectme').trigger('click'); dont work because of security right ? i need to go over windows.location ?
[01:51:11] <Nece228> mindis|wurk: lietuvis?
[01:51:51] <molavy> there is no idea?
[01:51:59] <peiper> blackice2999,  $('a.selectme').live("click", function() { window.location = $(this).attr('href'); });
[01:52:05] <peiper> or something like that
[01:53:04] <blackice2999> peiper: the problem is i need to catch a click on a outer div element and trigger the click on the a element on inner. But you confirmed my question with window.location...
[01:53:50] <Nece228> heres an example of json: {"name":"pirmas","date":"2012-04-26 10:53:05"}
[01:54:09] <Nece228> i want actually not to print out all the data, but only whats in date key
[01:54:15] <Nece228> how to do that?
[01:54:38] <peiper> blackice2999, what about binding an onclick on the outer div which uses .find() to get the href?
[01:55:31] <blackice2999> peiper: right this is not the problem. The problem is that $('a').click(); dont work. So i need to catch the href and set window.location (this is what i ask)
[01:55:49] <peiper> k so you know what to do ;D
[01:56:00] <blackice2999> peiper: thanks for your help ;)
[01:56:06] <peiper> no prob
[01:56:45] <peiper> Cork, $("#s2").load("some.html").success is not a function
[01:57:06] <blackice2999> Nece228: you can use parseJson to convert it in to a object
[01:57:20] <blackice2999> ?parseJSON
[01:57:21] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[01:58:32] <Xotix> how can i disable the scrolling of the parent if the child's scrollbar is at its max/min?
[01:59:22] <Cork> peiper: bah load returns the jquery object not the jqxhr :/
[01:59:35] <Cork> peiper: you need to use $.get or $.ajax instead
[02:00:10] <Cork> peiper: $.get('url').success(function(data) { $(elm).html(data); }).error(function() {});
[02:02:19] <Nece228> var jsonderulo = JQuery.parseJSON('{"name":"pirmas"}')
[02:02:21] <peiper> thanks Cork ill try that
[02:02:30] <peiper> jsonderulo 0.o
[02:02:31] <Nece228> Uncaught ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined
[02:02:39] <peiper> j lowercase
[02:02:45] <peiper> or use $.parseJSON
[02:03:05] <Nece228> ah thanks
[02:03:08] <Cork> no its jQuery
[02:03:13] <Cork> or $
[02:03:15] <Nece228> damn i cant get used to that case sensitive thing
[02:03:31] <Cork> ah sorry peiper
[02:03:37] <Cork> missunderstood what you meant :)
[02:03:42] <peiper> :D no prob
[02:04:19] <Nece228> hmm
[02:04:46] <Nece228> is parseJSON a replacement for getJSON?
[02:05:11] <Fuwex> Any tips for making jQuery Cycle work with fading text and image in internet explorer? Getting all kinds of transparency issues..
[02:05:12] <anli_> Can I remove a blur handler for an object?
[02:05:30] <Cork> Nece228: nope
[02:05:42] <peiper> yeah ajax works now, thank you Cork
[02:05:44] <Cork> Nece228: $.getJSON does a ajax call and parses the response text as json
[02:05:55] <Nece228> oh, ok then
[02:06:05] <Cork> Nece228: $.parseJSON takes a string argument and returns a js object
[02:06:20] <Nece228> which i later need to loop right?
[02:06:48] <Cork> that has nothing to do with it
[02:07:05] <Cork> $.parseJSON is used by $.getJSON
[02:07:25] <peiper> anli_, .unbind() ?
[02:07:34] <Nece228> var jsonderulo = jQuery.parseJSON('{"name":"pirmas"}')
[02:07:44] <Nece228> jsonderulo variable outputs me object
[02:07:58] <peiper> now try alert(jsonderulo.name);
[02:07:58] <Cork> Nece228: yes that will give you a js object
[02:08:20] <Nece228> if i want to see its content i need to loop it right?
[02:08:28] <Cork> no its not an array
[02:08:45] <Nece228> then how to do that?
[02:09:02] <Cork> Nece228: use the keys to access the data your interesting in; like peiper said
[02:10:24] <Nece228> ah thanks
[02:10:46] <Nece228> needed to do jsonderulo.name
[02:10:54] * Cork nods
[02:11:14] <peiper> =D
[02:12:24] <Nece228> sorry i couldnt help myself with that variable name
[02:12:39] <Cork> :)
[02:13:05] <Nece228> actually i would prefer jsonnewsted but whatever
[02:13:23] <peiper> we all know now, you're json derulo fan^^
[02:13:29] <peiper> jason* 0.o
[02:13:44] <Nece228> nah im not, but his songs are funny
[02:14:16] <peiper> you mean that rihanna effect repeating 100 times the same word and getting millions of dollars with that shit?
[02:14:37] <Nece228> yeah, every song beginning he says his name
[02:15:05] <peiper> how to song writing rihanna style: write one line, ctrl+c, ctrl+v, profit
[02:15:35] <Nece228> you got it :D
[02:20:37] <gener1c> i am using tiny scrollbar and i am trying to intercept the .scroll event, but for some reason i cant find the right element to check it for
[02:21:08] <anli_> If I foo.focus() will the event handler focus run immediately?
[02:21:26] <Cork> anli_: yes
[02:21:45] <Cork> or...
[02:21:53] <Cork> wait no focus isn't a jquery generated event
[02:22:02] <Cork> so it will run after your function ends
[02:22:04] <catcher> Anyone here used the twitter apis before? Do you have to manually regex replace the urls with actual links?
[02:22:27] <anli_> ah, ok
[02:22:33] <anli_> explains some
[02:23:37] <gener1c> anybody knows tiny scroller?
[02:24:27] <gener1c> this plugin is busting my chops
[02:24:39] <gener1c> http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/
[02:24:41] <peiper> then don't use it :D
[02:25:56] <gener1c> so what should i use?
[02:26:12] <peiper> dunno, whats ur prob with tiny scrollbar
[02:26:23] <gener1c> i am trying to intercept the scroll event
[02:26:29] <gener1c> i tried doing
[02:26:56] <anli_> Is there a way to detect if focus was jquery generated?
[02:27:02] <gener1c> $(selector).tinyscrollbar().scroll(function(){console.log('scroll')})
[02:27:10] <gener1c> nadda
[02:27:50] <gener1c> i read something in the faq about update()
[02:30:09] <NodeX> http://www.nodex.co.uk/blog/26-04-12/mongodb-jquery-php-rating-system-how-to
[02:30:15] <NodeX> oops wrong window
[02:33:38] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/UQSTG/1/
[02:33:43] <Nece228> im pretty sure im doing wrong
[02:34:07] <Nece228> need to find a correct way
[02:34:14] <mtgtnt> Good Morning / Evening to all
[02:35:08] <peiper> yeah what about closing the getJSON function? Nece228
[02:35:19] <Nece228> ignore that
[02:35:32] <Nece228> its not the full code
[02:35:33] <Cork> Nece228: uh...
[02:35:45] <Cork> its way WAY overcomplicated...
[02:35:48] <Nece228> ive just copy pasted part of it
[02:36:24] <mtgtnt> anyone know a workaround for the new bug with FF 12 and .button?
[02:36:26] <peiper> using key and val inside eachother will destroy your soul
[02:36:49] <Cork> Nece228: why do you generate the the jsonderulo at all?
[02:37:02] <Cork> Nece228: you already have it as a js variable
[02:37:34] <Cork> and if you want it var jsonderulo = { name: val };
[02:37:44] <Cork> no need to go the round about way around a json string
[02:38:09] <xec_> Cork: it's called creative programming. do less, write more
[02:38:16] <Cork> :)
[02:38:17] <peiper> hahaha
[02:39:04] <Nece228> what do you mean generate
[02:39:09] <Nece228> put in inside the loop?
[02:39:23] <peiper> please forget everything about loops for a moment
[02:39:47] <peiper> iLoop has joined the channel ... xD
[02:39:55] <xec_> lol
[02:40:03] <peiper> loopception
[02:40:04] <Cork> Nece228: data.name should give you what you want
[02:40:12] <Cork> Nece228: all the rest is unnessesary
[02:40:25] <iLoop> :-)
[02:40:29] <Cork> Nece228: or what ever the name is
[02:40:45] <Cork> Nece228: ah, wait its an array of objets
[02:40:53] <Cork> so the outermost loop is needed
[02:41:03] <Nece228> so?
[02:41:48] <Cork> Nece228: first var jsonderulo = jQuery.parseJSON('{"name:"' + val + '}') is the same as var jsonderulo = {name: val };
[02:41:55] <Cork> no need for all the extra craft
[02:42:23] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/UQSTG/2/
[02:42:31] <Nece228> i removed everythin
[02:42:50] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/UQSTG/3/
[02:43:10] <Cork> key is actually index
[02:43:14] <Cork> val is the object
[02:43:47] <woozly> guys, how to auto append <a> tag for links in text?
[02:44:07] <Cork> woozly: you mean convert text links to real clickable links?
[02:44:16] <woozly> Cork, yeah
[02:44:21] <Cork> woozly: regex
[02:44:48] <Cork> woozly: dom has very little support for text modifications
[02:45:08] <Nece228> ah thanks
[02:45:50] <Nece228> works
[02:46:03] <Nece228> function(key, val)
[02:46:10] <woozly> :(
[02:46:11] <Nece228> need to investigate how this magical line worked
[02:46:17] <mtgtnt> any workaround for no horizontal scrollbar in FF12 with .button and .buttonset?
[02:46:48] <soee> hi. how can i determine if checkbox was checked/unchecked and do something according to current state ?
[02:47:12] <Cork> this.checked or $(this).prop('checked')
[02:47:28] <Cork> or $('selector').prop('ckecked')
[02:47:32] <Cork> *checked
[02:47:52] <mtgtnt> im gonna take it that noone knows of this new bug then :(
[02:48:31] <soee> Cork, but is there something like change() for checkbox and does it work in all browsers ?
[02:48:48] <Cork> soee: no checkboxes uses click
[02:49:11] <Cork> (even when you change it with keyboard)
[02:49:32] <soee> ah thats what i was going to ask :D
[02:49:37] <soee> thank you
[02:49:45] <Cork> np
[02:52:06] <mtgtnt> can someone check this to be sure its FF12 and not just mine
[02:53:05] <peiper> what actually mtgtnt ?
[02:53:07] <Cork> mtgtnt: you have a test link?
[02:53:27] <mtgtnt> i do not have a public server to put one, only intranet :(
[02:53:37] <peiper> jsfiddle?
[02:53:42] <mtgtnt> ah
[02:53:50] <mtgtnt> forgot about that...
[02:59:06] <Cork> man i want to kill the default browser in android 2.3 T_T
[02:59:17] <Cork> its sooo freeking bugy
[02:59:33] <peiper> is there no firefox for android?
[02:59:43] <Cork> ya
[02:59:46] <peiper> <sarcasm> use ie
[02:59:46] <Cork> fennec
[03:00:26] <Cork> peiper: or rather there are
[03:00:31] <Cork> but doens't really help
[03:00:34] <rethus> what would be the best way to add additional lines to the view.
[03:00:34] <rethus> Should i create elemnts by add(), or should i create a html-construct, and paste it anytime with append? http://jsfiddle.net/UTWwt/2/
[03:00:56] <raj> Cork, do you have a few minutes? I have a rather perplexing question
[03:01:05] <Cork> rethus: add doens't add text to the page
[03:01:15] <Cork> raj: give it a shot
[03:01:27] <peiper> rethus, nimm append
[03:01:37] <Cork> if its long might be better to wait to after my lunch that starts now :)
[03:02:50] <rethus> peiper: k, means to create the  select and input fields as html and append this whole "html-sniplet" to the code as new line.
[03:02:57] <raj> k, well, I'll ask, and I'll wait up if you'd like to nosh first
[03:02:59] <raj> :)
[03:03:53] <rethus> and with attr. i can add a own id or name for each input-field
[03:04:09] <MacroMan> Can I have multiple form elements with the same name for use with .each() ?
[03:04:10] <raj> Cork, I'm trying to implement this code ( https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/995 ) into my site, so that I could have single requests carrying multiple files in IE. Basically, it's done by having multiple file input fields, and then collecting them all and POSTing with that. This is my code though, and I'm not sure how to integrate two the two--> http://68.46.138.78:8080/asdf (login is asdf:asdf, and then click on Change Picture link ...

[03:04:16] <raj> ... over the pic)
[03:04:47] <NodeX> [11:04:08] <MacroMan> Can I have multiple form elements with the same name for use with .each() ? : no
[03:04:51] <NodeX> but you can have name[]
[03:05:04] <MacroMan> name[] ?
[03:05:15] <NodeX> name="foo[]"
[03:05:32] <NodeX> foo[]=b&foo[]=c...
[03:05:38] <MacroMan> Ah OK. Then I can do ('foo[]').each() ?
[03:05:55] <NodeX> no because you ahve to escape it
[03:06:21] <NodeX> give them a class ... <input class="bar" name="foo[]" /> ... $(".bar").each...
[03:06:38] <MacroMan> Ah, then do each on the class name
[03:06:48] <NodeX> are you doing a form?
[03:06:56] <NodeX> might be easier to serialize it!
[03:07:06] <MacroMan> No, just some hidden fields and I need to get data from
[03:07:32] <MacroMan> Thanks for your help
[03:07:35] <NodeX> use a class is porbably easiest
[03:07:37] <NodeX> yw ;)
[03:07:49] <peiper> rethus, genau aber geb jedem element das du appendest ne eindeutige id mit durchzählen oder so
[03:08:30] <rethus> peiper: ok, ich versuchs mal in jsfiddle zurecht zu basteln.
[03:09:08] <peiper> rethus, sag bescheid wenn du hilfe brauchst wenn ich nicht antworte bin ich in der mittagspause ^^
[03:09:41] <rethus> peiper: ja, vielen dank. mach ich.
[03:16:00] <batmanian> Can someone suggest a reliable and well maintained drop down button jQuery plugin?

[03:17:04] <peiper> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[03:20:10] <aJacom> I'm having trouble with a website that apparently already has jQuery, and I can't load it again, but I'm not sure if its another type of script or what. How can I test its jquery? doing typeof($) returns "function", but trying to do something as $('#title').html("text"); returns null
[03:20:41] <rethus> aJacom: jsfiddle.com ?
[03:21:43] <rethus> if i use attr. to set an attribute, have the attribute still exist, or will theis function create the needed attribut if it not exist?
[03:22:24] <Flo0815> rethus: it will create it, if it's not existing
[03:23:01] <magentar> i am positioning a lot of divs in my site with jquery on window scroll events. however it always flickers a bit as the elements are then moved around. is there a way to stop that? for example by stopping event dispatching in the browser until the position modifications are finished?
[03:23:33] <Flo0815> aJacom: try $().jquery;
[03:24:33] <aJacom> Flo0815: undefined
[03:24:41] <Flo0815> aJacom: and try using 'jQuery' instead of '$'
[03:24:45] <Wilornel> Is it possible to get an image's width and height when it is in the server?
[03:24:51] <Flo0815> so jQuery.('#sth')....
[03:25:06] <Flo0815> Wilornel: $.load
[03:25:23] <aJacom> Flo0815 just adding the jquery script breaks the page. I don't have anything yet.
[03:25:56] <Flo0815> aJacom: ok i think the '$' gets overwritten by another plugin or script
[03:26:17] <Flo0815> aJacom: so use 'jQuery' instead of '$'
[03:26:34] <Flo0815> aJacom: like i worte: jQuery.('#selector')....
[03:26:57] <aJacom> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ <- that did it
[03:27:20] <rethus> have this script to add newe lines for filter: http://jsfiddle.net/UTWwt/7/
[03:27:20] <rethus> cause the name-Attr. is on ever select-box the same, i got problems to set the id.
[03:27:20] <rethus> What woule be a good way to handle this? maybe check, if name=xy && attr.id !set ?
[03:27:57] <Flo0815> aJacom: thats what i meant
[03:28:01] <Flo0815> $ gets overwritten
[03:28:43] <rethus> but checking for attr('id') while id not exist, will cause an error
[03:29:02] <rethus> thats not state of the art.. isn't it? is there a other clean way?
[03:29:13] <Wilornel> Flo: $('file/path.jpg').load(); ???
[03:29:36] <Flo0815> so your problem is, taht when u wnat to assign the id, it doesnt work all the time because sometimes the od is already existing?
[03:29:55] <Flo0815> Wilornel: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[03:30:00] <Wilornel> dude
[03:30:05] <Wilornel> they only talk about DOM elements
[03:30:40] <Xotix> I'm having some image upload on several elements with the same form in the background. You can't upload the same image twice, why?
[03:31:11] <Wilornel> Xotix: what are the errors?
[03:31:18] <Flo0815> Wilornel: u need a container where to load the image in, but u don't need to show this container. When the load is performed and the image is created, u can get the width or height
[03:31:20] <soee> id it possible to make div slideUp and in the sam etime its content to fadeOut ?
[03:31:31] <Wilornel> alright thanks
[03:31:31] <Xotix> No errors. It works if you choose a different image.
[03:32:02] <Flo0815> Wilornel: other way would be to perform an ajax request to php file, which gives u the image data
[03:32:12] <Flo0815> u can check images width and height in php
[03:32:13] <xec_> soee: if you use .animate() you can specify exactly what you want to happen
[03:32:35] <peiper> rethus, sagmal soll das ganze wirklich so auf javascript laufen? ich habe erst vor einiger zeit eine moduldynamische filterfunktion geschrieben (so wie du das da machen willst) die einstellungen sind als array in ner php session und für jeden weitern ich sag mal parameter wird die seite neugeladen und automatisch neu gefiltert vllt wär das ne idee für dich
[03:32:58] <mtgtnt> argh.. i cant even get a simple button to work in jsfiddle
[03:33:20] <rethus> peiper: ja, wÃ¤re auch ein Ansatz. zur not kÃ¶nnte man das Script ja via Ajax ansteuern.
[03:34:07] <peiper> rethus, naja ob das so die beste lösung wäre (ajax)
[03:34:58] <rethus> peiper: ja, bei mir ist das problem momentan, dass die seite nicht neu geladen werden soll. Es ist eine art Modal-Dialog, in welchen der user einmal alle Einstellungen festlegt und dann speichert
[03:35:34] <rethus> peiper: gibst du denn dein scriptlet so frei raus...?
[03:35:36] <Flo0815> rethus: du willst also einfach nur neue input felder hinzufÃ¼gen?
[03:35:47] <peiper> da würd ich spontan sagen frame auf ne oberfläche dafür (php) die ne session setzt
[03:35:59] <peiper> rethus, kann ich leider nicht (firmen software)
[03:36:00] <xec_> what the fuck just happened? did germany win the war?
[03:36:04] <rethus> ja, der user soll beliebig viele filter aus den vordefineirten werten erstellen kÃ¶nnen
[03:36:09] <Zhy> xD
[03:36:13] <Zhy> @xec
[03:36:22] <peiper> xec, hahaha helping in our own language is a little easier
[03:36:55] <Flo0815> rethus: $.('<input>').create oder sowas
[03:37:14] <peiper> Flo0815, was wird das?
[03:37:30] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/UTWwt/7/
[03:37:58] <peiper> rethus,  zeile 8 macht mir da bauchschmerzen
[03:37:59] <peiper> mom
[03:38:15] <rethus> frglich wÃ¤re jetzt nur der check, ob id gesetzt is. wenn nicht, dann soll er filter_<id> setzen. dann wÃ¤re es ja eigentlich schon fertig, oder?
[03:39:03] <peiper> naja
[03:39:06] <peiper> ist nicht so ganz stabil
[03:39:13] <peiper> ich schreib dich später an, mittagspause :>
[03:39:38] <rethus> ok. guten hunger
[03:39:42] <xec_> peiper: yeah i understand. i didn't mean to mention the war. you exclude about 98% of the channel from participating, though. may i suggest PM or #jquery-de or something?
[03:40:12] <raj> yay, guten hagen
[03:40:33] <magentar> cool, the flickering stops when i use .animate() instead of .css()
[03:51:23] <RA3OR> is there a out() function like $(this).siblings("a.afiseaza-raspunsul").hover(function(){ ?
[03:52:15] <RA3OR> im changing css color on hover, i want to change it back on mouseout
[03:52:25] <Xotix> RA3OR: mouseleave?
[03:53:05] <RA3OR> Xotix: thanks, much appreciated
[03:55:01] <Zhy> RA3OR: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/
[03:59:45] <mtgtnt> i cannot get .button or .buttonset to show the horizontal bug in FF12, anyone care to take a stab at this? all you need to do is create a simple page with a min-width of say 800px and create a jqueryui checkbox. in FF 12 you lose the horizontal scrollbar if you make the browser window smaller then the min-width
[04:01:28] <superdmp> hi, if any of the AnythingSlider crew about: when the user moves backwards and forwards through a slider, the browser registers those clicks as pages in its history, which can quickly fill up the history  - is there some way to avoid this?
[04:06:27] <soee> is it normal that if im using fadeIn and fadeOut all elements inside (that i would like to be hidden) become visible when parent element becomes visible?
[04:06:46] <soee> (well its toggle)
[04:09:12] <Whirl3d> soee, it depends on how you have your selector for the fade events setup
[04:09:28] <D4> var test = $('header'); if(!test) {} <-- how do I check if there's no test?
[04:09:49] <soee> Whirl3d, its animate function on container
[04:09:52] <D4> Do I have to do $(test).length > 0 ?
[04:09:54] <ciluu> .length
[04:10:38] <Aamir> I have many LIs. What will be the selector to show first 5 or 10 Lis and hide rest
[04:10:58] <Whirl3d> ? demo @soee
[04:10:59] <bot-t> soee, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:11:41] <Whirl3d> ? .lt@Aamir
[04:11:42] <bot-t> Aamir, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[04:11:57] <Whirl3d> ?.gt @Aamir

[04:12:02] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  just got it. Thanks :)
[04:13:01] <Poetro> Aamir: slice
[04:13:04] <Whirl3d> D4, you just have to test for length....if ($(sel).length) {do stuff}  you don't need to use $(sel).length>0
[04:13:31] <Aamir> Poetro:  Whirl3d's  solution is way better but thanks any way :P
[04:20:25] <mtgtnt> finally... FF12 .button horizontal scrollbar bug http://jsfiddle.net/JAMTY/embedded/result/
[04:20:34] <shwaiil> hi
[04:21:10] <mtgtnt> div has min-width: 1265px;
[04:21:28] <shwaiil> Q: What's the best way, to get "html" trough one ajax request, grab this data and put it on the DOM ? Thanks!
[04:21:33] <mtgtnt> once you resize browser to less than that, no scrollbar in FF12
[04:22:53] <mtgtnt> can anyone confirm?
[04:24:01] <Cork> mtgtnt: a normal get request and then append it to a dom element
[04:24:28] <mtgtnt> i think you meant that for shwaiil
[04:24:55] <Cork> lol true
[04:25:03] <Cork> man i could have swarn it was you xD
[04:25:18] <mtgtnt> nah. im the one with the new FF12 bu
[04:25:20] <mtgtnt> bug*
[04:25:27] <mtgtnt> driving me crazy
[04:25:30] <Cork> or right
[04:25:32] <mtgtnt> min-width: 1265px;
[04:25:43] <mtgtnt> http://jsfiddle.net/JAMTY/embedded/result/
[04:26:03] <mtgtnt> FF11 its fine
[04:26:27] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for looking. Let's say, I just prevent the submit to happen do the ajax request. The returned data, I'll use a selector just to get the "result" I want (like if I'm doing this unbostructively, sorry the english). Would that work ? I remember last year, there was a plugin because data returned from ajax, sometimes the jquery selector wouldn't work
[04:26:39] <Cork> mtgtnt: looks fine here
[04:26:49] <Cork> Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
[04:26:59] <mtgtnt> Cork: do you have a horizontal scrollbar?
[04:27:05] <Cork> no
[04:27:09] <mtgtnt> you should
[04:27:20] <mtgtnt> the div is 1265px wide
[04:27:40] <Cork> mtgtnt: not if you load the js script
[04:27:41] <mtgtnt> view in any other browser or earlier FF
[04:27:52] <mtgtnt> ?
[04:28:04] <gener1c> what scrollbar decoration plugin is the most robust?
[04:28:13] <gener1c> and has the best doc
[04:28:59] <Cork> mtgtnt: http://imagebin.org/209811
[04:29:27] <mtgtnt> Cork: yes, but as you notice, there is no horizontal scrollbar at the bottom
[04:29:54] <Cork> you mean the bar should be there?
[04:30:00] <mtgtnt> Cork: yes
[04:30:09] <Cork> cause it is if i don't load jquery
[04:30:30] <mtgtnt> right, the .button and .buttonset are not working correctly in FF12
[04:30:36] <Aamir> How to get first 5/10 Lis out of long list (is there any selector, i know i can use array splice etc)
[04:30:59] <mtgtnt> your confirmation is what i needed.. so its either FF issue or jquery ui will need to update
[04:31:00] <Cork> mtgtnt: ok, now i know what i should be looking at; one min
[04:31:13] <peiper> rethus, re
[04:31:14] <Cork> mtgtnt: not sure it is, like i said, one min
[04:31:43] <Aamir> $('li').get().splice(0,5); if there is a better way
[04:35:52] <raj> Senor Cork
[04:35:54] <raj> :)
[04:36:56] <Cork> mtgtnt: ya it looks like a bit of a weird behavior when you have position absolute elements in a table
[04:37:23] <Cork> mtgtnt: its the inputs position: absolute that causes it
[04:37:44] <mtgtnt> Cork: so either mozilla messed something up or jquery ui needs to change?
[04:38:09] <Cork> though left: -1e+8px; is a really weird value
[04:38:43] <mtgtnt> could you report this to the right group? I have never done that before
[04:38:50] <Cork> mtgtnt: so its easy enough to fix
[04:38:52] <mtgtnt> im just good at finding the darn things :(
[04:39:06] <Cork> mtgtnt: change that to a less silly value and it works
[04:39:33] <mtgtnt> Cork: anything I can do now to make it work?
[04:39:36] <Cork> mtgtnt: .ui-helper-hidden-accessible
[04:39:53] <mtgtnt> cork: checking
[04:39:54] <Cork> mtgtnt: left: -1000px;
[04:40:01] <Cork> thats all thats needed
[04:40:06] <peiper> Cork is a 24/7 IRC-jQuery Guru
[04:40:28] <Cork> mtgtnt: or you could just set display: none; on it
[04:40:41] <Cork> not sure if some obsucre old ie breaks on it though
[04:42:09] <mtgtnt> Cork: IE8 or better is required to use the site anyways. Is this left: -99999999px; default?
[04:42:51] <Cork> yup
[04:42:58] <Cork> and its too large for firefox
[04:43:02] <Cork> (in tables)
[04:43:26] <mtgtnt> and the  display: none; works :)
[04:43:32] <Cork> :)
[04:44:39] <mtgtnt> Cork: Thank you.. now to update 26 theme css files and off to a meeting
[04:45:49] <Cork> if only i could fix this stupid android browser as easy >_>
[04:51:09] <anli_> I get a lot of "attempt to run compile-and-go-script on a cleared scope" messages in the error console
[04:51:23] <anli_> Anyone else that also is flooded with them?
[04:54:44] <peiper> anli_, error or warnings?
[04:55:05] <peiper> oh i see them
[04:55:13] <peiper> its firebug they'll need to update to ff12
[05:11:22] <Wabbels> Hello people! I have a question about disable/enable a submit button.
[05:12:08] <pachet> ask and you shall receive
[05:12:09] <pachet> maybe
[05:12:57] <Wabbels> Ehm allright, here it goes.
[05:14:39] <Wabbels> I made a webchat and i got the submit button to be disabled when the textbox is empty and enable when i start typing but...
[05:15:31] <Wabbels> as soon as i hit the submit button, it does not disable the submit button again
[05:15:51] <Wabbels> but in my head it should since the textbox is empty again
[05:16:20] <Cork> Wabbels: what checks that the textarea is empty?
[05:16:22] <pachet> do you set it back to disabled? :[
[05:16:44] <fris> Wabbels are you using a form plugin? most of them have a parameter on success, then you could disable the button
[05:17:19] <Wabbels> $('input[type="submit"]').attr('disabled','disabled'); $('input[type="text"]').keyup(function(){     if($('input[type="text"]').val() == 0){         $('input[type="submit"]').attr('disabled','disabled');     }     else {         $('input[type="submit"]').removeAttr('disabled');     }
[05:17:29] <Wabbels> thats what i use to disable the button
[05:17:48] <Cork> Wabbels: your doing the check in keyup
[05:17:57] <Wabbels> (im kinda new to this)
[05:18:03] <Cork> when you reset it from the submit it doesn't trigger a click
[05:18:07] <Cork> *uh keyup
[05:18:11] <Wabbels> yep
[05:18:32] <raj> Cork, any words for me?
[05:18:47] <Cork> Wabbels: so you need test it on submit too
[05:19:20] <pachet> don't really need to test it
[05:19:22] <pachet> just reset it
[05:19:48] <pachet> you already know you passed the test, because you're able to submit in the first place
[05:20:31] <minna> how do i trigger an inline onblur with jquery?
[05:21:02] <Wabbels> i need the submit button to disable again as soon as i press enter or hit the submit button
[05:21:20] <pachet> inline events with jquery are like trying to run a taxi company with fleet of fighter jets
[05:21:22] <Cork> raj: ugg that as indepth
[05:21:29] <Cork> raj: don
[05:21:47] <Cork> don't think i can take enough time to dig into that now
[05:22:03] <minna> Nvm, it was easy
[05:22:32] <raj> well, honestly, I just don't undestand the concept of how they want to accomplish creating multiple input fields with this https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/995

[05:26:27] <ThiefMaster> thought this was #python

[05:26:54] <Xotix> ThiefMaster: thanks i^ll check it out
[05:32:40] <Xotix> is there an array function which is like push but after the specified index?

[05:36:47] <babelawra> hi everybody, i'm stuck so i need ur help please. Here is the problem: I have a template with ajax navigation menu with anchor (index.html#contact for example). One of these pages is the contact form but it's not js validating, and does the php way like js is off. how can i solve this path or url problem? js is in the js folder and the load_page.php is at the root thanks :)
[05:36:48] <gener1c> you can json decode it
[05:36:59] <sviatovigt> I am decoding it
[05:37:11] <Cork> sviatovigt: its null
[05:37:13] <gener1c> then its js
[05:37:26] <sviatovigt> but if I try if(decodedData == null) {do smth}

[05:41:40] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any way to use jQuery's '.on' functionality to return the events it had previously before I use '.off'?
[05:41:51] <Cork> no
[05:41:57] <anli_> Is getComputedStyle() standard?
[05:42:09] <Cork> in modern browsers
[05:42:25] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: That was directed at me? Is there any way to accomplish what I want?
[05:43:04] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: the last was for anli_
[05:43:13] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Ok thanks, was a little confused lol
[05:43:19] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: not really, you can get all the events created by jquery
[05:43:27] <Cork> but there isn't really any list of all events
[05:43:49] <pachet> !
[05:43:50] <pachet> i object
[05:43:52] <jelly1> hi
[05:43:54] <pachet> $(foo).data('events')
[05:44:27] <jelly1> i have an issue with my radiobutton, i have a .live('click') event on the radiobutton with an AJAX request and the button get's unckecked after the ajax request is finished
[05:44:38] <anli_> Is it like window.getComputedStyle(input.get(0)).getPropertyValue("border");
[05:44:38] <anli_> ?
[05:44:51] <pachet> $.each($(foo).data('events'),function(i,e){$.each(e,function(i,h){console.log(h.toString());});});
[05:44:54] <pachet> DeltaHeavy^
[05:45:05] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: What I want is I have a bunch of stuff under .click and .hover for a couple of classes. Depending on certain conditions I want these events to be turned on or off, but when I turn it on I want the events to have the same functionality as they previously did without having to redelcare everything or make a function for it all.
[05:45:14] <Cork> anli_: document in gecko, webkit, and opera and elm.currentStyle in ie
[05:45:34] <anli_> document instead of window?
[05:46:00] <DeltaHeavy> Sorry if I wasn't clear. I don't want a list of all possible events, just the ability to turn a block of '.click'/'.hover' on or off.
[05:46:16] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: customarily you'd do that within the callback
[05:46:29] <Cork> anli_: but why do you need it?
[05:46:37] <Cork> jquery uses it already
[05:46:52] <pachet> $(foo).on('click.mynamespace', function () { if ( some_value ) { return; } /* do stuff * / });
[05:47:32] <anli_> Cork: I am replacing an input type="text" with an input type="password"
[05:47:38] <anli_> Then I want to have the same border style
[05:47:44] <Cork> anli_: you can't
[05:47:53] <Cork> at least if you want ie support
[05:48:02] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Is there any way to not redeclare everything I want to do and just turn a bunch of stuff on and off? Like I want this click event to work when this equals this, but not when it equals this?
[05:48:19] <anli_> Cork: ok?
[05:48:26] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: sure, what i said
[05:48:29] <Cork> i told you that yesterday
[05:48:34] <pachet> make your bound event do that conditional logic for you
[05:48:35] <anli_> What if I write style="border: inherit" on the input?
[05:49:02] <Cork> anli_: i mean you can't swap password elements in an out freely
[05:49:10] <Cork> ie will stop you
[05:50:45] <anli_> I am doing that
[05:50:49] <anli_> I swap the entire element
[05:51:02] <anli_> Already done so apparently, its possible
[05:51:36] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Sorry, I think I'm either not understanding how that would accomplish my task or I'm just communicating things wrong. I have ~5 click/hover functions declared in some function. Other functions that swap menus I want to be able to turn these events on or off. When I turn something off, I just wanted to run "$('.class').on('click');" and have those click events just work again. Is this not possible? Would it be easier to just create a function that gi
[05:52:04] <jelly1> hello?
[05:52:25] <i3ooi3oo_> olleh
[05:53:39] <jelly1> i have an issue with my radiobutton, i have a .live('click') event on the radiobutton with an AJAX request and the button get's unckecked after the ajax request is finished
[05:54:00] <jelly1> well when the $.ajax() starts its unchecked somehow
[05:54:41] <peiper> provide a jsfiddle please jelly1
[05:54:45] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Ok, I guess I just need to walk myself through it
[05:54:59] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Thank you for your help!
[05:55:11] <jelly1> peiper: http://dpaste.org/WocWg/
[05:55:24] <jelly1> peiper: could it be because i load the 'radiobutton with AJAX too?'
[06:10:18] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: late response, but maybe you meant something like this:
[06:10:19] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/RG2JM/
[06:14:21] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: I'm not really sure what it's doing. I'm clicking on #foo but nothing is happening. I'm pretty new to JS and jQuery all together so I'm pretty unknowlegable about this stuff
[06:14:38] <rethus> does a image not have a click() event?
[06:15:05] <rethus> i have an image with class=del, and try to do $('.del').click()
[06:15:13] <rethus> seems not to fire an click-event
[06:15:56] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: it binds two events to foo, then immediately disables them
[06:16:00] <DeltaHeavy> rethus: It does, there must be an error in your code somewhere.
[06:16:02] <pachet> then 3 seconds later, re-enables them
[06:17:44] <nFFF> Could someone do me a masssive favour and add http://www.safeguardclothing.co.uk/ballistic-helmets/pas-tac-level-iiia-ballistic-combat-helmet-olive-drab/ this item to cart, and click checkout, and see if when it goes to https version its ok
[06:17:52] <nFFF> Im getting invalid cert, but sys admin isnt
[06:17:56] <nFFF> need to confirm its not my comp
[06:18:39] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: I'm not getting anything in my console log. I'm not framiliar with a lot of the code you're using so if you want to stop trying I understand. I'm not even sure if this is what I want.
[06:21:30] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: no events in console? hrm. which browser are you using? and you're waiting three seconds before you click?
[06:21:45] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Firefox with Firebug
[06:22:05] <DeltaHeavy> And I tried clicking a bunch of times over a fair period of times, during multiple refreshes
[06:23:01] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Derp, had to press run -_-
[06:23:30] <smykes> I have a peculiar issue:  if (($("body").find("#alertId").length) == 1)    Where length is 0 in the debugger isn't going to the else it's going into the if
[06:23:36] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: :[

[06:24:52] <imanc> has anyone noticed that fading opactiy in IE 8/9 looks screwy?  http://www.cloudninehair.com/media/new/img/home_tab/g3.png
[06:27:40] <smykes> pachet you have any idea?
[06:28:21] <Hooloovoo> smykes: skip the parantesis around the jquery statement
[06:28:59] <Hooloovoo> if ( $("body").find("#alertId").length == 1 ) { console.log("yay") } else { console.log("nope") }
[06:29:05] <Hooloovoo> maybe?
[06:30:29] <smykes> Hooloovoo I know that it is hitting the if
[06:30:37] <smykes> but the value is clearly 0 in firebug
[06:31:24] <Hooloovoo> smykes: hmm
[06:32:09] <Hooloovoo> if ( $("body").find("#alertId").length === 1 ) { console.log("yay") } else { console.log("nope") }
[06:32:12] <Hooloovoo> try that
[06:33:59] <pachet> find('#some_id') is redundant in 99% of cases
[06:34:00] <smykes> Hooloovoo still hits it lol
[06:34:01] <smykes> wtf
[06:34:22] <Hooloovoo> smykes: ummm... that's weird
[06:34:22] <pachet> var foo = $('#alertId').length; if ( foo ) { console.log(foo); }
[06:34:29] <smykes> is there a better way to do whether it eists or not
[06:35:01] <smykes> and if it doesn't exist it will return 0 pachet?
[06:35:38] <gho5t> it's a length so yes. he is using some hackery to equate > 0 to true
[06:35:46] <pachet> its technically not returning anything
[06:35:55] <pachet> a function returns something
[06:36:09] <pachet> a variable accessing a property ( .length ) is set to a value
[06:36:28] <smykes> so if the selector doesn't eixst the value will be 0
[06:36:35] <pachet> ...that's wasn't worded very well. a variable is assigned to a property value*
[06:36:49] <rethus> DeltaHeavy: you see my error? http://jsfiddle.net/5tCnd/1/
[06:37:32] <pachet> if the element specified by the selector doesnt exist, the returning jquery object will have a length property of 0
[06:39:21] <pachet> rethus: i see your error
[06:39:30] <pachet> inside your bound event, you use the generic selector, instead of $(this)
[06:39:53] <pachet> so it returns the parent element of the first element found via that selector
[06:40:14] <pachet> not technically an error, but i'm assuming that's what you mean
[06:41:49] <rethus> k, thanks, but this doesn't fix my problem
[06:42:04] <rethus> wonder why... in jsfiddle it works
[06:42:09] <rethus> in my code it doesn't work
[06:42:48] <pachet> oh you're still having that issue with click not firing
[06:43:12] <pachet> there are a lot of possible reasons why the event isnt being bound
[06:43:17] <pachet> do you have any errors in your console?
[06:44:09] <rethus> no errors
[06:45:06] <smykes> pachet even doing it your way it makes it into the if
[06:45:09] <smykes> so strange
[06:45:33] <MikeH> When using .prepend() what does it return?
[06:45:47] <MikeH> I assumed it would return the element identifier for the new element
[06:47:06] <pachet> smykes: log $('#whatever_your_element_is').get(0).innerHTML inside your if block
[06:47:06] <Carlitta87> im trying to call an ajax function. reason being is that my table(html) has data i wud like to delete, but its on another php page (not the main page). i have written a snippet that i thought could work but it only returns the link i place on the onclick attribute. my question is, what can i do to make this work?
[06:47:09] <rethus> pachet: if i encapsulate it into an a href, i got a click event of the href.
[06:47:21] <rethus> but the image doesn't fire an click event
[06:48:08] <smykes> oh i see my problem
[06:48:09] <smykes> duh
[06:48:13] <smykes> don't mind me
[06:48:27] <rethus> is there a way to simulate a click on firebug console?
[06:51:20] <peiper> rethus, not with javascript ^^
[06:51:56] <rethus> even if i do a href... onclick="return false" i got NO event fired

[06:57:19] <dbugger> Hey guys. How could I move the first 2 paragraphs of a div#container to the end of it?
[06:59:11] <smykes> rethus you can simulate a click
[06:59:20] <smykes> just do $("#foo").click()
[06:59:54] <rethus> ah, great, thanks

[07:02:01] <burg> hello. how can i check/uncheck a checkbox with jquery?
[07:02:27] <dbugger> thanks!
[07:02:55] <pachet> burg: $('input[type="checkbox"]').attr('checked', true).attr('checked', '')
[07:03:28] <burg> pachet, thanks
[07:04:16] <smykes> pachet should that be .prop for IE 7 sake?
[07:05:36] <smykes> I know IE 7 doesn't care for .attr when referring to disabling buttons pachet
[07:10:41] <shoky> it should be .prop
[07:11:08] <pachet> eh, yeah, that should be prop
[07:11:16] <pachet> sigh
[07:11:46] <pachet> $(foo).get(0).checked = true

[07:15:09] <jelly1> is fetching some table via ajax (with a button ) and then fetching another page with ajax on the button press no recommended?
[07:15:38] <shoky> it really depends on your app
[07:15:45] <shoky> and what you want happening
[07:15:58] <jelly1> shoky: answering me?
[07:16:00] <snimavat> How do i prevent autocomplete select event from firing, when key is pressed inside autocomplete
[07:16:01] <shoky> ya
[07:16:22] <jelly1> shoky: well ok let me describe my problme
[07:16:38] <sisb> snimavat http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[07:17:24] <snimavat> I want to stop autocompleteselect event from firing - can u expand how keuyp can be useful ?
[07:17:50] <sisb> $('element').keyup(function() { return; });
[07:17:53] <sisb> I think
[07:18:03] <jelly1> shoky: i have a table with  radiobuttons and an .live('click' on the radiobuttons to fetch another table, the fetching works but the button doesn't "stay" selected
[07:18:11] <sisb> Or don't bind autocomplete to that element in the first place
[07:19:17] <sanova> hi
[07:19:37] <snimavat> Let me explain my issue - we have an autocomplete, which has a custom keypress event bound as well. so when user enter some thing in autocomplete text box and press enter... it is used as new value to enter, if used chooses some thing exsiting from suggestions... its used as existing
[07:20:04] <snimavat> now when user chooses a suggestion and press enter, both autocomplete suggest, and keypress is triggered
[07:20:09] <snimavat> i want to stop one of them
[07:20:19] <shoky> jelly1: i dont see how fetching something with ajax would deselect a radiobutton? unless you did something with the ajax response that unchecked/replaced the radio button
[07:20:45] <jelly1> shoky: well yes I suppose it should work but it doesnt, somehow the ajax request messes it up
[07:20:56] <sisb> snimavat Sounds like your autocomplete code sucks.  I need a demo on jsfiddle.net
[07:21:03] <shoky> i dont think it's the request, it's what you're doing with the response
[07:21:13] <jelly1> shoky: http://dpaste.org/NSHFI/
[07:21:22] <jelly1> shoky: i load it in a div, and its not the same div
[07:21:59] <jelly1> shoky: even uncommeting the .append functions on success doesn't let the radiobutton checked
[07:22:53] <sanova> i have some issues with a remote json for autocomplete search. It responds to me with correct json, but it returns me also a "parsererror". Comparing the correct json of example-demo i can see that it contains jquery Id of request. Can error be caused by that ?
[07:23:06] <snimavat> sisb: you are right, its crap, existing code
[07:24:46] <jelly1> shoky: disabled ajax caching too
[07:26:23] <chuwiey> hi all, is it possible to use $('element[attr="value"]') where value is case insensitive?
[07:26:49] <shoky> jelly1: and when commenting the whole success callback ?
[07:26:57] <jelly1> shoky: let me see
[07:27:34] <shoky> and what do you mean it doesnt 'stay' selected? it gets selected and then deselected?
[07:27:58] <jelly1> shoky: yes
[07:28:11] <jelly1> i can see the 'red' dot and then it directly gets deselected
[07:29:19] <jelly1> shoky: and if i comment /* $.ajax() */ it works
[07:30:04] <shoky> and if you comment just the success callback contents?
[07:30:24] <chuwiey> anyone?
[07:30:44] <jelly1> shoky: same issue
[07:30:44] <shoky> chuwiey: it's not possible out-of-the-box
[07:31:00] <chuwiey> shoky: k, thanks :)
[07:31:30] <shoky> jelly1: huh.
[07:31:37] <jelly1> shoky: o?
[07:31:53] <shoky> so nothing happens on success but it still gets deselected?
[07:32:44] <jelly1> shoky: yes
[07:33:24] <shoky> i'd have to see more code/demo ...
[07:33:27] <jelly1> shoky: yeah its pretty annoying
[07:33:29] <jelly1> shoky: ok
[07:34:04] <Flo0815> someone's here with experience in Flowplayer in dynamically added elements?
[07:34:16] <jelly1> shoky: http://dpaste.org/39Oj8/ the whole JS,  i fetch the radiobuttons from loadData
[07:34:23] <jelly1> shoky: then let me show you an example radiobutton

[07:41:23] <shoky> wri0ip0ikfp0
[07:41:29] <shoky> s0lved.
[07:41:34] <timing> OMG I switched to workspace 4
[07:41:57] <shoky> jelly1: sorry something is missing... im not seeing the full picture
[07:42:03] <jelly1> shoky: hmm
[07:42:15] <shoky> also , what red dot? ;p
[07:42:33] <jelly1> shoky: i mean the 'red' dot that Firefox shows when you select a radiobutton
[07:42:35] <jelly1> ;0
[07:42:40] <shoky> oh ff
[07:42:47] <sisb> #redDot {position:fixed;bottom:10px;right:10px;font-size:1px;color:red;}
[07:42:56] <DeltaHeavy> I'm using jScrollPane on a div that has a dynamic level of overflow. I want the user to go 'back', select another option, go forward and then that div will have more/less overflow. This kill jScrollPane as the bar doesn't appear. How can I go about fixing this?
[07:43:13] <shoky> jelly1: there is no reason why an ajax request that does nothing on callback would deselect a radio button...
[07:43:13] <jelly1> shoky: even in chrome it doesnt wrok
[07:43:20] <jelly1> shoky: i know
[07:43:28] <jelly1> shoky: but if the radiobutton comes from an ajax source?
[07:43:40] <shoky> once its in the DOM, its just a checkbox in the DOM
[07:43:50] <raj> shoky, lemme know if we can tackle the upload thing whenever you get a chance
[07:44:00] <shoky> raj i'll give it another shot in a bit
[07:44:14] <jelly1> shoky: ok
[07:44:14] <raj> cool
[07:44:31] <jelly1> shoky: hmm fun i just added the checkbox to the page without ajax and that works
[07:44:35] <EdwardIII> hrm, there sure are a lot of colour picker plugins. how do i know which one doesn't suck heh?
[07:45:00] <jelly1> EdwardIII: the one with the best documentation
[07:45:21] <shoky> jelly1: you getting any console errors maybe?
[07:45:27] <jelly1> shoky: nope
[07:45:30] <shoky> derp
[07:45:55] <jelly1> shoky: it must be somehow that the button comes from an ajax source hrrm
[07:46:24] <snimavat> sisd: This is my exact problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/875643/how-can-i-prevent-a-later-binding-on-a-jquery-autocompleter-from-firing
[07:46:27] <shoky> but you said even when it does come from ajax, if you comment out the other ajax request, it stays checked
[07:46:32] <snimavat> but i still dont get the solution mentoined there
[07:46:40] <snimavat> it doesnt work somehow
[07:46:54] <jelly1> shoky: yes
[07:47:06] <jelly1> shoky: that still applies
[07:47:11] <shoky> are you sure you commented out the whole success callback?
[07:47:12] <snimavat> sisd: in my case, keypress is being called before the select event
[07:47:16] <jelly1> so the request i do interferes with the button
[07:47:42] <jelly1> shoky: yup
[07:49:18] <shoky> i have no idea then
[07:49:36] <gho5t> so in my ajax success function I take my object and apply a template to it (Mustache js). It contains an anchor in the html that I want to bind a click function to. Is the right way to do this to search for the link and bind the click handler? e.g. var html = Mustache.to_html($("#template").html(), value); html.find("a").bind(...
[07:49:52] <shoky> i've never used .live, it's recommended to use .on instead, delegating the event handling to a container element
[07:49:59] <shoky> .live just uses .on though
[07:50:07] <shoky> so i assume that's not the problem
[07:50:24] <shoky> but you can try anyway ;S
[07:50:29] <shoky> otherwise i have no idea
[07:50:52] <jelly1> ok
[07:52:46] <shoky> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token function
[07:52:51] <shoky> what the hell does that mean
[07:53:47] <raj> maybe a dangling comma after vars are declared
[07:53:49] <shoky> ah nm
[07:53:54] <shoky> missing comma :P
[07:54:07] <jelly1> shoky: nice how on doesnt work on that table hrrm
[07:54:27] <shoky> how are you calling it
[07:54:44] <shoky> and, does the table exist in the DOM when you're making the .on call
[07:56:26] <jelly1> shoky: hwo do i check it?
[07:57:01] <jelly1> i have firebug
[07:57:30] <shoky> dont check it
[07:57:35] <shoky> be sure of it
[07:57:55] <shoky> is it a table that you create in the raw html?
[07:57:58] <jelly1> i need .live() since the button doesn't exists yet since I load it from ajax
[07:58:07] <shoky> or do you build the table after an ajax request
[07:58:25] <shoky> you should delegate the .on to something that exists already in the DOM and wont get destroyed/replaced
[07:58:37] <nFFF> shoky
[07:58:41] <shoky> 'body' or document are also options
[07:58:44] <jelly1> shoky: hmm ok
[07:58:46] <nFFF> if your console log of your page showed these messsgaes : http://jsfiddle.net/kBZQm/
[07:58:51] <nFFF> what would you presume was happening?
[07:59:15] <jelly1> shoky: ok i have a page, then call a AJAX request and fetch a table in a div ( the one with buttons ) and i have a .live event on those buttons that load another table
[08:00:00] <jelly1> but the event happens, and the ajax too
[08:00:07] <shoky> nFFF are you asking if it looks like something fishy?
[08:00:11] <jelly1> just the button doesnt stay selected or gets selected shoky
[08:00:40] <jelly1> rawr i can't find anything on google either
[08:01:05] <nFFF> shoky yes
[08:01:18] <MacroMan> When using .each() to loop DOM elements, what order will they be in? The order they appear in the DOM?
[08:01:20] <nFFF> shoky, http://www.safeguardclothing.com/15-bullet-proof-vests/
[08:01:22] <shoky> jelly1 you should either delegate the .on to an element that is just there from the beginning. or, you only call .on AFTER adding the table to the DOM,
[08:01:25] <nFFF> if you look at the console.log
[08:01:32] <nFFF> do you see some wierd requests at the bottom
[08:02:26] <shoky> nFFF as a developer, i'd just assume it's a technical problem with the website
[08:02:46] <shoky> not handling SOP right or whatever
[08:03:07] <shoky> oh you gave a link
[08:03:31] <shoky> er yea that doesn't look nice at all
[08:04:30] <shoky> MacroMan: i believe so, yes
[08:05:01] <nFFF> shoky, you see the shit at the bottom?
[08:05:05] <shoky> yah
[08:05:14] <shoky> and at the top ;p
[08:05:33] <shoky> com.issuu:Hijacking links on page
[08:05:37] <shoky> :\
[08:07:37] <MacroMan> shoky: Thanks. I'll assume that for now, but definately do a test later
[08:07:37] <nFFF> com.issu is fine
[08:07:42] <nFFF> its the unsafe javascript
[08:09:32] <shoky> MacroMan: im not really sure what the order is if you just have a jq collection of different random elements from different parts of the DOM
[08:09:48] <shoky> so yah, test if its important
[08:10:40] <shoky> nFFF i don't see anything about unsafe javascript
[08:10:56] <shoky> just com.issuu stuff
[08:11:53] <jelly1> shoky: even with .on or .delegate it doesnt work
[08:12:06] <jelly1> it HAS to be that silly ajax request that is blocking the onclick event
[08:13:24] <Chopps> hey guys, is there any way to append a value to an attribute without deleting the old attribute value? eg. name="cars", i want to append the value "homes", and i want the final attribute value to be name="cars homes". ive only managed to replace the value, not append it: http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/WgQZm/
[08:13:30] <snimavat> here's the jsfiddle for the autocomplete keypress event issue http://jsfiddle.net/W6Sz4/2/
[08:13:37] <snimavat> The issue is just in firefox
[08:14:43] <johnkpaul> Chopps: not with a single easy jquery function, but you can just check the attr first
[08:15:13] <chuwiey> hi all, a newb question: I'm getting "Uncaught ReferenceError: src is not defined" because i'm trying to define array[foo][bar] inside a loop without having defined it originally. I'm doing this because the bar index name is created dynamically. What is the proper way of doing this?
[08:15:17] <chuwiey> Also, how do I set a var to an array which is the product of a function. pastie-> http://pastebin.com/LWtHfrDJ (for both questions)...
[08:15:45] <johnkpaul> Chopps: $(this).attr("name",$(this).attr("name")+" homes");
[08:15:55] <johnkpaul> cache the jquery object though, but that's the idea
[08:17:24] <snimavat> sisd: ?
[08:17:24] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: you don't define the variable "src" that you use on line 16
[08:17:29] <johnkpaul> what is src supposed t obe?
[08:17:29] <Chopps> oh i see, let me try it :D
[08:17:44] <johnkpaul> also, what is a product of a function, chuwiey?
[08:17:53] <snimavat> sisb : http://jsfiddle.net/W6Sz4/3/
[08:18:11] <Chopps> johnkpaul http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/WgQZm/1/ :D very simple answer, thanks man
[08:18:11] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: src should be the src attr of the img...
[08:18:16] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: no problem
[08:18:34] <johnkpaul> Chopps: no problem, :)
[08:18:39] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: so use this.src
[08:19:11] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: what I meant by product of a function is for instance what happens with imgArray - how do i set it to be the value of all those img[x] arrays that i created inside the each() function... ?
[08:19:17] <chuwiey> and thank you!
[08:19:37] <shoky> jelly1: you're not using async:false or anything dumb like that?
[08:19:48] <jelly1> shoky: nope
[08:19:58] <jelly1> well chache: false now
[08:20:14] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: so, what you have as the variable imageArray, should actually be an object, not an array
[08:20:20] <johnkpaul> because you're using string indexes, not integer indexes
[08:20:30] <jelly1> shoky: also tried a $.post()
[08:20:41] <gho5t> in jquery widgets, this.element is wrapped in jquery, right? why isn't this wrapped too?
[08:20:50] <ven0m> Hey guys, I've wrote a simple lightbox using jQ. The ligthbox is opened using jQuery extention function. Everything works fine in all browsers except IE8. http://jsfiddle.net/rd8wb/
[08:20:59] <shoky> jelly1: sry no idea.. if you want you can pastebin the whole thing (including html...) and i'll take a look in a bit
[08:21:04] <shoky> or someone else might
[08:21:09] <jelly1> shoky: aslo when the function doesnt return anything nothing happens
[08:21:12] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: so imgArray = { .. } ?
[08:21:12] <jelly1> i mean the ajax cal
[08:21:15] <jelly1> *call
[08:21:17] <jelly1> shoky: i will
[08:21:18] <ven0m> The error i am getting is ""Object doesn't support property or method 'openLightbox'"
[08:21:25] <jelly1> shoky: but i am taking a break
[08:21:30] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: yes, nothing in the {}
[08:21:34] <shoky> k ;]
[08:21:51] <jelly1> shoky: maybe i have some silly double var somewhere or js
[08:22:17] <shoky> what did you mean by-  <jelly1> shoky: aslo when the function doesnt return anything nothing happens
[08:22:36] <jelly1> shoky: when i just make an AJAX call but return "";
[08:22:40] <jelly1> shoky: as in the data
[08:22:59] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: ok fixed. but it still says that src isn't defined... ?
[08:22:59] <shoky> return that from where
[08:22:59] <jelly1> shoky: you know what, i will try a scatch page with minimal JS/html
[08:23:04] <jelly1> shoky: php
[08:23:07] <shoky> ah
[08:23:08] <johnkpaul> did you change it to this.src?
[08:23:27] <jelly1> shoky: i think trying stuff from scratch a bit might work
[08:23:54] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: and how do i set multiple objects within the imgArray objects?
[08:24:13] <jelly1> shoky: thanks for the help btw ;)
[08:24:18] <snimavat> Can any one help me with jquery autocomplete and event gotachas
[08:24:18] <snimavat> http://jsfiddle.net/W6Sz4/5/
[08:24:23] <shoky> jelly1: np
[08:24:24] <johnkpaul> sorry, actually, chuwiey, imageArray should have been a []
[08:24:31] <johnkpaul> but imageArray[i] should have been an object
[08:24:37] <johnkpaul> because that's where you're using string indexes
[08:24:58] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: it might be helpful to go through a javascript refresher, did you write this code from scratch
[08:25:46] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: yup...
[08:26:48] <ven0m> The error i am getting is ""Object doesn't support property or method 'openLightbox'"
[08:26:52] <ven0m> Hey guys, I've wrote a simple lightbox using jQ. The ligthbox is opened using jQuery extention function. Everything works fine in all browsers except IE8. http://jsfiddle.net/rd8wb/
[08:29:20] <jelly1> shoky: yes
[08:29:34] <jelly1> $("#left").ajaxComplete(function(event, request, settings)
[08:29:36] <jelly1>     {
[08:29:50] <jelly1> shoky: that was the whole problem
[08:30:36] <jelly1> ugh never steal silly code from the interents
[08:32:15] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: k, i read a refresher. Better understanding of stuff now. I do have a question in regards to trying to set an object property name dynamically ie. fb.propertyName should be set to the value of this.property ?
[08:33:30] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: I don't know anything about the fb api if tha'ts what you're asking
[08:34:27] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: nope.. what i'm asking is how would i set an object property using a dynamic name? ie. obj.property where property is dynamic ?
[08:35:09] <shoky> jelly1: yes i was about to ask about that ajaxComplete , forgot ;)
[08:40:52] <poppiez> I have this slideshow jquery plugin where I preload images in advance. each image is hosted on Amazon S3 each with an ETag. when I show the preloaded images, chrome makes a new request for the images and gets a 304 not modified back resulting in the images "blinking" in chrome, which is the time from when the requests starts to it finishes. how can you prevent this?
[08:44:27] <johnline3> thug life!
[08:44:40] <EdwardIII> hah
[08:44:56] <DeltaHeavy> Can anybody help me out with jScrollPane? I can't get it to reinitialize.
[08:46:59] <johnline3> <img src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/malsup/cycle/beach1.jpg" />

[08:47:41] <johnline3> hello i have a return function reading from the above <img src= line, i am now changing the img src line to <div><p>Image 01</p><img src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/malsup/cycle/beach1.jpg" /></div>
[08:48:10] <johnline3> not wure what to modify in the + slide.src + area
[08:48:35] <johnline3> *-* sure
[08:55:19] <ven0m> Hey guys, I've wrote a simple lightbox using jQ. The ligthbox is opened using jQuery extention function. Everything works fine in all browsers except IE8. http://jsfiddle.net/rd8wb/
[08:55:22] <ven0m> The error i am getting is ""Object doesn't support property or method 'openLightbox'"
[09:02:05] <nod_> hello, got questions about the future/roadmap of jQuery, who might be able to answer? :)
[09:02:39] <NodeX> support will cease on april 1st 2013
[09:03:22] <ajpiano> nod_: ask away
[09:03:56] <nod_> I'd like to know what's the timeline on making jquery modular
[09:04:14] <ajpiano> there isn't a set plan in place
[09:04:21] <nod_> or if it's even planned
[09:04:54] <nod_> oh well, is there some event that might catalyze that? like a big jquery conference soon?
[09:05:12] <ajpiano> there's a conference in late june
[09:05:17] <ajpiano> but we aren't going to be announcing modularity
[09:05:42] <gnarf> nod_: lets just say, we are definitely interested in exploring how we can break up the components, but its not slated for 1.8 release
[09:05:50] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:06:00] <nod_> so that won't be happening next year pretty much?
[09:06:34] <gnarf> nod_: I would think that in the next year, most of the work will be done - a lot of it depends on the build tool supporting modular compilation
[09:07:11] <gnarf> nod_: i might be overly optimistic on that topic, but I think it will prove accurate.
[09:07:18] <nod_> well the timeline i'm looking at is early next year, so it looks like it definitely won't be stable by then
[09:07:51] <nod_> well early is april/may, so in 12 months
[09:09:38] <nod_> where can I follow this kind of things without subscribing to yet another mailing list? :)
[09:10:53] <gnarf> nod_: weekly meeting perhaps?
[09:11:02] <gnarf> nod_: mondays, noon Eastern, #jquery-meeting
[09:11:43] <gnarf> nod_: http://jquery.org/updates - its a firehose of meeting notes, but its useful
[09:12:01] <ajpiano> you can also lurk in #jquery-dev :)
[09:12:10] <ajpiano> and follow the bug reports and git commits
[09:13:07] <gnarf> nod_: and I'm not sure if there is anyone on the team who's taken charge of this push yet, although we all pretty much want to see it happen
[09:13:12] <nod_> all right, thanks for the info guys :)
[09:14:14] <nod_> gnarf: yeah well me too actually, full disclosure I've launched https://drupal.org/node/1541860 that on the drupal side, jQuery is getting too fat for what we use of it.
[09:14:37] <ajpiano> nod_: oh you're THAT nod_ :)
[09:14:45] <ajpiano> i knew that name seemed familiar
[09:15:00] <nod_> actually i'm curious about what you think of that over here
[09:15:14] <nod_> (not sure that the good kind of fame though :p)
[09:15:26] <ajpiano> most of the folks i talked to about it were pretty taken aback, including me
[09:15:33] <nod_> and eventually fix misconceptions there are
[09:16:35] <ajpiano> "What I don't understand right now is if you'd like to trade 35kb of jQuery with 25kb of other libraries." resonated with me
[09:16:39] <nod_> for the record I'm not against jquery at all, i love it
[09:16:46] <ajpiano> not to mention how long the process of creating that other 25kb and sourcing whatever else you want to use
[09:16:48] <ajpiano> i know
[09:17:00] <nod_> ajpiano: well i'm looking at 5-8k lib certainly not 25
[09:17:21] <gnarf> nod_: do you use events, traversal, ajax, effects?
[09:17:41] <nod_> and my main issue is events, we're not really doing crazy stuff with dom and we underuse ajax and ajax events so much it's not funny
[09:17:59] <nod_> and for events i came across bean that does exactly what I want
[09:18:27] <ajpiano> i think that concerns about you guys spending a long time ripping out jQuery
[09:18:35] <fourcolo1s> wow
[09:18:36] <ajpiano> and then everyone in userland putting it back in
[09:18:41] <fourcolo1s> exit
[09:18:43] <fourcolo1s> dang
[09:18:43] <nod_> and i found out in the process that for custom events jquery is not broadcasting real events, so that's all jQuery specific callbacks that can be run
[09:18:44] <ajpiano> are also merited
[09:18:59] <gnarf> ajpiano: eh - if drupal core doesn't depend on it, then any version is safe in userland...
[09:19:17] <ajpiano> right, but many many many folks are going to end up including jQuery anyways after
[09:19:29] <gnarf> ajpiano: of course, it is jQuery after all ;)
[09:19:37] <ajpiano> because they need it for their own site
[09:19:44] <nod_> ajpiano: we've effectively shut out any developer not using jQuery, that's one of my concerns as well.
[09:19:54] <ajpiano> nod_: isn't the drupal admin heavily dependent on jqueryui as well?
[09:20:04] <nod_> hahaha that's the best part, no.
[09:20:15] <ajpiano> it was the last time i used drupal
[09:20:24] <nod_> and the only part using jquery ui is a module that almost got removed for D8
[09:20:41] <nod_> ajpiano: where?
[09:20:55] <ajpiano> there used to be a fair bit of draggable sortable type stuff iirc
[09:21:07] <nod_> overlay is custom code with an iframe, tabledrag is a totally custom script
[09:21:22] <nod_> yeah that's tabledrag. and it's horrible code
[09:21:24] <ajpiano> nod_: who are you worried about shutting out? people who use other libs, or people who prefer straight JS
[09:21:29] <nod_> but it's accessible at least
[09:21:37] <xmaddness> Does jQuery have a global "an event has been fired" event?
[09:21:49] <ajpiano> xmaddness: no
[09:21:53] <xmaddness> doh
[09:21:55] <nod_> ajpiano: other libs mainly,
[09:22:12] <ajpiano> nod_: you know what the marketshare # for libs looks like, yes?
[09:22:20] <nod_> but I'm guessing we'll have more and more of the second type of people by D8 release
[09:22:33] <xmaddness> Doyou think its possibly to extend the jQuery base event trigger system to catch all events?
[09:22:46] <nod_> ajpiano: no, but I want to use YUI and don't want to have to load jQuery at the same time
[09:22:48] <nod_> :p
[09:22:48] <xmaddness> like to log all events fired
[09:24:23] <ajpiano> nod_: fair enough, i suppose
[09:24:41] <nod_> gnarf: do you mind if I quote you in the drupal issue about the timeline to get jquery modular?
[09:24:46] <ajpiano> but also seems like a really heavy lift for a relatively marginal benefit
[09:25:04] <Abbas5> guys, is it possible to hide a certain div within an iframe on pageload?
[09:25:31] <nod_> ajpiano: well, we'll only support IE8 so we can boost perf quite a bit if we stay careful about querySelector
[09:25:40] <ajpiano> nod_: numbers i saw from march are that no library is about 47% of sites, jQuery is about 45% of sites, Mootools is about 5%, Prototype 4%, YUI 2%
[09:26:18] <nod_> ajpiano: thanks for the numbers :) that's pretty interesting. also, well done.
[09:26:24] <ajpiano> heh
[09:26:29] <gnarf> nod_: so long as you include the fact that its just my personal guess... I suppose
[09:26:32] <ajpiano> that's why i asked who you are trying to avoid shutting out
[09:26:54] <gnarf> nod_: i don't want to sound like an authority on the issue, but its my take that it will be a definite goal in this next year
[09:27:12] <ajpiano> xmaddness: it strikes me as a bad design decision to have an app that would require to do it
[09:27:20] <nod_> gnarf: sure, i'm not using it as an argument, don't worry, just people have been a pain in the ass about that topic, just relaying the information
[09:27:40] <xmaddness> ajpiano: this is for a dev logging system
[09:27:45] <ajpiano> mm
[09:27:48] <xmaddness> it will not go into production
[09:27:54] <nod_> gnarf: and by your guess, with production-ready results by april ?
[09:28:20] <xmaddness> basically I am looking to console.log all events fired
[09:28:30] <xmaddness> if(console) of course
[09:28:45] <ajpiano> nod_: on the other hand, i can see why it would be useful to get it out of core
[09:28:53] <ajpiano> the whole jquery_update thing is a real pain in the arse for everyone, i imagine
[09:28:58] <gnarf> nod_: hard to say - I'd hate to "promise" and be wrong, we still might not do it
[09:29:11] <ajpiano> nod_: you have no idea how often people come along still using jQuery 1.2.6 or 1.3.2 and then "can't upgrade"
[09:29:17] <gnarf> nod_: but I would hope we do something....
[09:29:21] <gnarf> soon
[09:29:21] <gnarf> :)
[09:29:32] <Whirl3d> Good morning all.  I create an image element, bind a loadsuccess handler that, among other things, records the image's height and then appends it to the dom. Why is the height sometimes 0 if it is measuring it in the success handler?
[09:29:33] <johnkpaul> xmaddness: if you really need this, you can override jQuery.fn.trigger and wrap with whatever logic you want
[09:29:50] <xmaddness> johnkpaul: yeah thats what I am thinking
[09:31:31] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I don't know if there is any guarantee that the image is loaded until the element is in the DOM
[09:31:42] <johnkpaul> perhaps using the Image constructor would avoid that
[09:32:18] <Whirl3d> that's what I do. I say var image=new Image(); var img=$(image); img.load(successhandler).attr("src", url);
[09:35:08] <Carlitta87> i wud like to make all the elements in a div with an ID and concatenate a number to each one....how can i do that?
[09:35:19] <johnkpaul> oh, I see, Whirl3d, I thought you just created the dom element
[09:35:25] <ajpiano> Carlitta87: just put a number at the beginning of the html ?
[09:35:27] <johnkpaul> this might have some answers http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4285042/can-jquery-ajax-load-image
[09:35:29] <ajpiano> is what you want to do ?
[09:36:30] <ajpiano> Carlitta87: $("#foo").children().prepend(function(i, html) { return i; }); should do the trick
[09:37:05] <Carlitta87> ajpiano: the fields are dynamically displayed
[09:37:27] <Carlitta87> nad the use can add a set at each click of a button
[09:37:47] <ajpiano> Carlitta87: you have to program a little. :)
[09:37:56] <johnkpaul> haha
[09:38:05] <johnkpaul> where's the jquery-lance channel
[09:38:16] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, the problem with that solution is that it applies the src attribute before the load handler. So on small images or cached images (particularly in IE), the load handler never fires. You have to follow their solution with a statement like if (image.complete) {img.trigger("load");} to ensure that the load handler is successfully triggered.
[09:38:45] <Whirl3d> Still, it doesn't solve the mystery of 0 height?    width appears to be showing up, just not height?
[09:38:50] <Carlitta87> ajpiano: they can be duplicated just fine...but i need to add unique id fields
[09:38:53] <nod_> ajpiano: gnarf: thanks a lot, you've been super helpful to me. Also gnarf i've quoted you here: https://drupal.org/node/1541860#comment-5922582 let me know if you want me to change/remove things.
[09:38:57] <Carlitta87> for them to be inserted into the db
[09:39:20] <ajpiano> Carlitta87: all the setter functions accept a function that does iterate
[09:39:48] <michaelfavia> is there a decent way to swap out the <head> elements from a $.ajax() call into my current document?  append() seems to strip to the <head> tag via .domManip
[09:39:48] <ajpiano> so you can do $("someElems").attr("id", function(i, id) { return id+"_"+i; });
[09:40:53] <gnarf> nod_: I think its still waiting for approval or something, can't find that comment
[09:41:02] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: swap out? what are you trying to remove?
[09:41:19] <nod_> gnarf: our pages takes a long time to load
[09:41:23] <nod_> it's at the very end
[09:41:27] <Whirl3d> michaelfavia, did you try setting yoru dataType to "text" and then using String methods to extract the head. Then append it to the current head?
[09:41:28] <johnkpaul> just beacuse you remove a link to css, or script tag, it won't actually remove the changes to the page that were caused by those elemenets
[09:41:30] <nod_> there is no delay usually
[09:41:43] <ajpiano> nod_: i'm sure jQuery.each is to blame for all the slow load time, right ;)
[09:41:47] <gnarf> nod_: the last comment is #57
[09:41:54] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, im trying to fetch a htmlpage via ajax and load its page bod and head in the current page.
[09:42:11] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, for reason beyond my control. trust me
[09:42:14] <nod_> ajpiano: no, it's eval and onscroll this time :d
[09:42:19] <Carlitta87> ajpiano: i did this "newElem.children(':first').attr('id', 'name' + idnum).attr('name', 'name' + idnum);" but, it only gets the first html element
[09:42:29] <nod_> gnarf: oh wow, i see
[09:42:30] <ajpiano> Carlitta87: why does that surprise you
[09:42:32] <michaelfavia> Whirl3d, im about to do just that but i was hoping there might be a better non regexy way
[09:42:40] <nod_> that sucks i'll see what's going on
[09:42:44] <ajpiano> you explicitly selected the first element only
[09:43:23] <Whirl3d> I have been told that you can manipulate the returned text as html using jquery before you append it to the dom. But the secret is, you have to get the text, not the html
[09:43:35] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: why does it _need_ to be in the head?
[09:43:53] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, because i need the css and js elelments in the head of the remote document
[09:43:58] <michaelfavia> so i can replace the local ones.
[09:44:11] <johnkpaul> so that's what I don't believe works as you expect
[09:44:15] <johnkpaul> you can't "replace" the local ones
[09:44:25] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, i can appen to head right?
[09:44:26] <johnkpaul> if you remove a link rel=stylesheet
[09:44:30] <johnkpaul> those styles don't leave
[09:44:43] <Whirl3d> but you could define a new style over them, right?
[09:44:57] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, interesting and understandable
[09:45:10] <michaelfavia> Whirl3d, that would make for a memory hog :)
[09:45:12] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: what do you mean?
[09:45:25] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, hes implying that i could just keep ovelaying styles
[09:45:34] <Whirl3d> so, if my remote content has a "goofy" style and my local content has a "goofy" style, and I load the remove doc, I'd want the remote "goofy" style to overwrite the local
[09:45:35] <johnkpaul> oh, sure, you can add more to it
[09:45:40] <johnkpaul> right, yes, you can do tht
[09:45:43] <Whirl3d> or redefining
[09:45:44] <johnkpaul> it would cascade
[09:46:07] <Whirl3d> load the remote* doc, sorry
[09:46:49] <Whirl3d> but you would have to append the style to the head of the local document, wouldn't you?
[09:47:10] <johnkpaul> no, it doesn't have to be in the head
[09:47:31] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, apparently through jquerymobile this is a way to affect chaneg between transitions. pageBeforeCreate(0 or something
[09:48:14] <nod_> gnarf: it's up, sorry it was drupal.org cache taking 10 minutes to refresh
[09:48:23] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, im being told this not finding it on my own.
[09:48:41] <johnkpaul> hm, michaelfavia, I don't know much about jquery mobile beyond the hello world
[09:49:23] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, ok i can selecttively import only NEW stylesheets..
[09:49:32] <michaelfavia> which just mean s i need ot compare before append.
[09:49:43] <michaelfavia> so i dont have to worry about that issue.
[09:50:18] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: they don't have to be new, but if they area already on the page, nothing will change
[09:50:34] <johnkpaul> all I'm saying is that you can't remove the styles just by removing the elements in the head
[09:50:41] <johnkpaul> but if they are new, and they're intended to be that way, you should be fine
[09:51:00] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, i can insure they will be.
[09:51:03] <michaelfavia> new that is
[09:51:19] <michaelfavia> so im left with trying to fetch them and append.
[09:51:44] <michaelfavia> which im doing via ajax.. perhaps load('src.html link')?
[09:53:54] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: using the default load, I think youll get everything you're looking for
[09:54:05] <johnkpaul> $("#your-jquery-mobile-page").load("src.html")
[09:54:12] <johnkpaul> that will execute scripts and add all of the styles
[09:54:46] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, thats a problem because i only want it to add link/script elements that dont exist :(
[09:54:58] <johnkpaul> that's where I'm confused, why do you care?
[09:55:55] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, wont it just keep layering stylesheets ina  memory hog nightmare if they get loaded more than once?
[09:56:03] <michaelfavia> the ame stylesheet that is.
[09:56:08] <michaelfavia> s/ame/same
[09:58:11] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: I don't think that's how browser rendering works
[09:58:34] <johnkpaul> there is actually a how css works in the browser presentation on lanyrd somewhre that I'm trying to find for you
[09:58:42] <johnkpaul> I watched it months ago, does anyone know what this is?
[09:58:59] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, you dont see a problem adding <link>s with the same src url over and over again?
[09:59:05] <michaelfavia> it wont load them all but only the first?
[09:59:12] <johnkpaul> once a css file is interpreted (or whatever the right word is), only the data structure that is created is held in memory
[09:59:16] <michaelfavia> i woudl think that it should key the ayyar off of the source.
[09:59:26] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: it will load them each time, but it won't keep them in memory three times
[09:59:42] <johnkpaul> because each css file changes this data structure that I dont' remember
[10:00:03] <johnkpaul> for example, if you add the same exact rule 1000 times in your css, I don't thnk that the memoryrequired is increased by 1000 times
[10:00:10] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, yes so after 10 pages though it has to reapply the 1 css file 10 times right?
[10:00:15] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, interedsting
[10:00:51] <johnkpaul> it would be interesting for you to test, michaelfavia
[10:01:25] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul, yeah imay have to. thank you for all your help and time much appreciated. johnkpaul++
[10:01:34] <johnkpaul> sure, no problem
[10:01:37] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm#CSS_parsing might help
[10:01:42] <michaelfavia> thanks
[10:01:43] <johnkpaul> definitely let me know if you learn more
[10:01:50] <michaelfavia> i will. the least i can do :)
[10:01:52] <michaelfavia> johnkpaul,
[10:06:00] <johnkpaul> michaelfavia: this is what I was looking for http://lanyrd.com/2012/sxsw-interactive/spmbt/
[10:06:36] <michaelfavia> hah. i live across the street here in austin :)
[10:06:38] <michaelfavia> thx
[10:08:23] <johnkpaul> np
[10:12:23] <heoa> I have coordinates as [object object] like [(0,0),(1,2)] -- from <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,160,160" <---- how can I access them?
[10:12:56] <heoa> Used each -function and then split(',') but getting type-error...
[10:18:59] <Whirl3d> so, here's a weird one: I am loading my images by creating the image element, applying a loadhandler and then defining the "src" attribute. In my anonymous load handler function, I log the image element (not the jquery object) and the images clientWidth and clientHeight properties. THEN I call my formatting function. However, the log results show the image post-formatting...how is that possible?
[10:21:46] <Whirl3d> heoa, coordsx=source[0].split(","); coordsy=source[1].split(",");
[10:25:13] <Whirl3d> or evenvar coords= $("area").prop("coords").split(","); var xmin=coords[0], xmax=coords[2], ymin=coords[1], ymax=coords[3];
[10:27:36] <tjmehta> when I am using $.ajax({contentType:'applicationJSON', data:data, ....}) shouldn't data be converted to a json string internally.. it appears to still convert the data object to form-urlencoded (the default contentType).
[10:27:53] <tjmehta> sorry, contentType:'application/json' ****
[10:29:12] <Carlitta87> i was doing a test with children, but the string that i was testing for append isnt working, i was hoping sumone cud help me identify where i went wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/frT9b/ thanks in advance.
[10:33:06] <heoa> Whirl3d: How can I see which attributes/properties the area -thing have? (I am getting undefined so I need to verify whether I input the values correctly...
[10:35:00] <heoa> I have tried alert($('areaThing')) and it throws [object object] -- but cannot see what it contains...
[10:35:01] <Whirl3d> Carlitta87, if you meant to append the link when the "testing" button was clicked, you need to use: $("a").click(....
[10:35:26] <Whirl3d> heoa, are you familiar with dev console?
[10:36:06] <heoa> CTRL+Shift j in GoogleChrome, I use that and there the console
[10:37:04] <Whirl3d> Then don't use alert to debug. It's bad. Use console.log($('.areathing')); and you will see a little expanding arrow that lets you see the properties of the thing you just logged
[10:38:37] <Whirl3d> Carlitta87, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/frT9b/7/
[10:38:53] <Whirl3d> you were close...
[10:47:08] <heoa> console.log(world)
[10:47:08] <heoa> <img style=â€‹"width:â€‹ 500px;â€‹ height:â€‹ 500px;â€‹ background-color:â€‹ yellow;â€‹" usemap=â€‹"#world" id=â€‹"world">â€‹
[10:47:35] <Lyfesaver> Hey everyone =) I asked a question on stackoverflow, and as I am not a jQuery guy, I dont understand his question. Can anyone shine some light on this issue?
[10:47:36] <Lyfesaver> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10328622/set-varible-on-mouseover
[10:47:57] <Lyfesaver> i dont understand his "answer" not question
[10:48:01] <heoa> The map #world has the coordinates, how can I access the coordinates now? $('world').prop('coords') returns undefined Whirl3d
[10:50:06] <cordoval> is jquery.live the right way to call again some js code from an external file that was run on load?
[10:50:11] <Jon47> Lyfesaver: jquery uses CSS notation for selectors, so when a string is preceded by a period that means it's an html class name
[10:50:35] <cordoval> basically im ajax getting/refreshing a form and need to regenerate some buttons i did initially
[10:50:38] <cordoval> what is the way?
[10:50:53] <Whirl3d> ? demo @ heoa
[10:50:53] <bot-t> heoa, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:51:22] <Lyfesaver> jon47 thats what I was thinking, and that makes sense for sure, but i dont understand WHY a CSS class would be placed there
[10:51:39] <Whirl3d> cordoval, I would say that it is never a good time to use live. It has been deprecated and tends to be a problem.
[10:51:44] <Lyfesaver> I guess it would help if i had a better groundwork knowledge of jQuery and I understood it's scope
[10:51:54] <Lyfesaver> but i dont =(
[10:51:54] <cordoval> Whirl3d: what then?
[10:52:09] <Whirl3d> ? .on @ cordoval
[10:52:10] <bot-t> cordoval, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:54:43] <woopawoop> hey, I'm trying to get the price of an amount that doesn't have a specific identifier, eg "<h3 id="text">for only $12.00 you can ...</h3>" is there a way I can use find and contains to get just the $12.00?
[10:55:02] <cordoval> but Whirl3d did you understand my problem?
[10:55:23] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, notice that there is no accepted answer to your stackoverflow quesiton. The answer presented doesn't make sense.
[10:55:43] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d, THAT makes sense =)
[10:55:45] <Lyfesaver> lol
[10:56:14] <Whirl3d> cordoval, if you wish to use a function that generates buttons on some content, name the function and then in your success handler, run the function again.
[10:56:45] <Whirl3d> However, if your funciton is a "handler" function that handles events for certain elements, than use .on on the parent element
[10:56:46] <heoa> Whirl3d: http://koti.kapsi.fi/he/Bugs/k.html <-- here is a bug that I am trying to solve with references.
[10:58:37] <Whirl3d> heoa, the problem is that your map element contains the coordinates. not world
[10:59:47] <Whirl3d> so, to select the map element, give it an id, like id='worldMap' and then you can select the area elements inside the map element to get your coordinates
[11:02:19] <Whirl3d> woopawoop, you will have to use regex and String to get to your information
[11:03:29] <Whirl3d> but the regex should be pretty straight forward:  something like /($[0-9]*\.[0-9]{2}/ might work.
[11:04:07] <heoa> Whirl3d: is there some function to get only one element from the map -thing? like $(map1)[1]?
[11:04:25] <heoa> or do I need to use the each -function for fast debugging...
[11:04:29] <woopawoop> thanks Whirl3d
[11:04:32] <woopawoop> you're the man
[11:05:08] <heoa> I am now able to access the world-map
[11:05:22] <Whirl3d> $("map area").first()
[11:06:04] <Whirl3d> or $("map area").eq(num)   for some number (0-based) of the element in the list
[11:06:46] <knapper_tech> are jquery selector sets able to be cast as arrays in any way?   i wanted to run .shift() and was disappointed
[11:10:33] <knapper_tech> i want to run $('.class').shift()
[11:11:24] <HardFu> anyone knows a plugin that does this: http://www.ifo.dk/
[11:11:28] <HardFu> the blue unfolding
[11:11:32] <johnkpaul> ?toArray @knapper_tech
[11:11:32] <bot-t> knapper_tech, .toArray(): Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set, as an array. http://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[11:12:13] <knapper_tech> johnkpaul:   righto
[11:15:20] <morteza_ipo> hi
[11:16:41] <woopawoop> hey Whirl3d, I tried a 			alert($('h1').text().replace(/([^0-9].*)/g, ""));
[11:17:38] <mathew_boston> I'm still stuck on the slideToggle and Sortable weirdness. Anyone want to take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/BNJzB/52/
[11:17:57] <mathew_boston> If you do the three steps, you should see it
[11:19:33] <heoa> Whirl3d: $(world2.firstElementChild).prop('coords').split(',')[2] <--- works in console but cannot get it working on the test site...
[11:20:03] <heoa> I mean when I write it as javascript/qQuery...
[11:20:17] <Whirl3d> woopawoop, gimme a second and I'll get you the right regex...
[11:20:40] <Whirl3d> heoa, wtf is .firstElementChild?
[11:22:08] <heoa> Whirl3d: It works in Google Chrome's console
[11:22:24] <heoa> (it gets me the first element in the map thing
[11:22:49] <heoa> I pressed TAB in Google Chrome's console and it suggested me the cmd and it worked there
[11:22:58] <heoa> (but not in javascript...)
[11:23:17] <K3|Chris> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Element.firstElementChild
[11:23:55] <Whirl3d> woopawoop, try this (it's ugly, but it should work: /\$[0-9]{1,3}(?:,?[0-9]{3})*(?:\.[0-9]{2})?/
[11:24:27] <Whirl3d> heoa, do it like I suggested earlier if you want it to work.
[11:24:49] <woopawoop> yup, that rempved the price from the string
[11:24:55] <woopawoop> how do i put what was removed into a variable?

[11:27:20] <james13433> its been 4 hours since I joined prototype and not one other person has said a word, other than me :(
[11:27:30] <johnkpaul> james13433: Object.extend
[11:27:36] <johnkpaul> that's how you extend in prototype
[11:27:42] <johnkpaul> there are examples in the docs, I'm pretty sure

[11:30:33] <heoa> (google chrome's console and the javascript/jQuery seem to work totally differently)
[11:31:02] <johnkpaul> james13433: so you don't want to subclass, you just want to override an existing property?
[11:31:24] <johnkpaul> just overwrite/wrap initAutocomplete
[11:31:25] <james13433> Yeah johnkpaul, so asif I was just directly editing it.
[11:31:51] <heoa> err env vars...
[11:31:57] <johnkpaul> james13433: I really wish I could just tell you to go to the Magento forums ;)
[11:31:58] <tjmehta> When using $.ajax({contentType:'application/json', data:data, ....}) shouldn't data be converted to a json string internally.. it appears to convert the data object to a form-urlencoded string instead (the default contentType).
[11:32:19] <tjmehta> ?
[11:32:33] <james13433> johnkpaul our good friend danslo told me a while back that not the best way to do it. and sent me a simple line of code that does, but I've lost it :(
[11:33:07] <johnkpaul> hm, you should ask him for it again, I don't think prototype has any better way to monkey patch
[11:33:38] <james13433> johnkpaul, indeed he's not around I don't think I can't see his name atleast
[11:35:53] <woopawoop> hey Whirl3d, figured someout more simple out
[11:35:54] <woopawoop> 			var element = $('h1').text().split(" ");
[11:35:55] <woopawoop> thanks
[11:37:29] <heoa> Whirl3d: or $("map area").eq(num)   for some number (0-based) of the element in the list <--- this I cannot understand.
[11:37:41] <heoa> Do I have list?
[11:38:01] <heoa> I have specied it like <area ...> ...<area ...>...
[11:38:07] <heoa> in the map thing
[11:38:27] <Whirl3d> $("map area').eq(0) will give you the first one.
[11:38:40] <cob> anyone have any idea how a $("#my-small-form").serialize() could pick up data from #my-large-form ?
[11:39:15] <heoa> Whirl3d:  $(world2).eq(0) <--- when I triy this in console, it does not work like that...
[11:39:21] <heoa> It returns the whole data structure
[11:43:40] <Whirl3d> you are going to have to create a fiddle if you want me to help. Go to jsfiddle.net and setup an example that we can work on togheter and I'll help more. Otherwise, we are just going to keep chaing our tails here.
[11:53:08] <jedimind> so if i have an img element, and i want to remove its src so no image displays, but i still have that IMG element to play with in the dom...
[11:58:16] <heoa> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/GFWHp/8/ <-- I have tried to do it as simple as possible
[12:02:08] <heoa> Fixed a bug [9].

[12:03:00] <knapper_tech> don't understand how to call click or on with a dom element instead of a matched set
[12:04:52] <knapper_tech> wait....is each() chainable?
[12:05:04] <knapper_tech> i still need the indexes though
[12:05:34] <chris_n> I have some code like this: http://paste.koha-community.org/366
[12:05:46] <knapper_tech> trying to write $('.class').each(function(i,ele){ ele.click(foo(i))});
[12:06:04] <Whirl3d> heoa, there are lots of problems with your code. I am commenting on it right now and will give you a link in just a minute
[12:06:21] <chris_n> however, when I click the input button multiple times, the event handler triggers every time
[12:06:37] <chris_n> rather than once as the .one method advertises
[12:06:57] <chris_n> what am I missing?
[12:07:07] <NoiseEee> knapper_tech: $('#commonParentID').on('click','.class',function(el) { el = $(el); alert('yoink! you clicked '+el.prop(id)); }
[12:07:32] <NoiseEee> knapper_tech: don't assign event handlers to .each element you find....
[12:08:07] <knapper_tech> NoiseEee:   got it
[12:09:04] <NoiseEee> knapper_tech: also, s/el.prop(id)/el.prop('id')
[12:10:37] <knapper_tech> sed syntax should be illegal on irc lol

[12:22:49] <heoa> I removed headers etc as instructed in the docs
[12:23:43] <Whirl3d> heoa, listen here...the area tag defines a clickable area in an image map. It doesn't change the box at all.
[12:24:22] <heoa> yes but #world2 does not exists!?
[12:24:53] <Whirl3d> it works fine in my code
[12:25:49] <Whirl3d> it's just that there is nothing toappply the map to
[12:26:23] <Whirl3d> you can look at the values in the console to see that it is working, but it doesn't scale the image, just the area you can click within
[12:27:02] <entropy-> I have a question.
[12:27:37] <entropy-> How do I change the default vertical scrollbar to scroll to the bottom auto?
[12:27:42] <entropy-> Of a div.
[12:28:07] <entropy-> I am using a 5 second tier to refresh a divâ€™s contents.
[12:28:10] <entropy-> Timer*
[12:28:21] <entropy-> It always starts out at the top.
[12:28:29] <entropy-> I want it to start out at the bottom.
[12:28:54] <heoa> Whirl3d: I cannot understand how, can I somehow downlead this code ? When I am in console, world displays nothing.
[12:29:33] <sarspazam> just having a look at how this site works
[12:29:34] <sarspazam> http://www.mosandbows.com.au/
[12:29:40] <thang> ?scroll
[12:29:40] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[12:30:05] <sarspazam> can you do the same as curtains js with scrollTop()
[12:30:20] <Whirl3d> heoa, the reason that world displays nothing is that world is defined inside the scaleTheBox function as a local variable. You won't see it outside that function.
[12:30:55] <Whirl3d> heoa, http://jsfiddle.net/GFWHp/27/
[12:31:06] <Whirl3d> now, log outerWorld
[12:33:03] <rorx> I'm trying to figure the broken image example on http://api.jquery.com/error/ .. I get the missing.png for both missing valid images.

[12:33:23] <apassi> hi, if i have wrapped my dom object with jquery "var tmp = $(domObject);", is there a way to unwrap the tmp?
[12:33:26] <Whirl3d> I guess console can't log "map" elements
[12:34:25] <Whirl3d> ? demo @rorx
[12:34:26] <bot-t> rorx, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:34:58] <Whirl3d> ?.get() @ apassi
[12:34:59] <bot-t> apassi, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:36:05] <apassi> Whirl3d: thanks, for the performance, i think this does new search for dom tree, instead just taking the wrapped object out from jquery..
[12:36:07] <michaelfavia> are "unchained" jquery statements executes serially or at the same time?
[12:37:10] <Whirl3d> var elem=$("#theDiv") returns a dom element wrapped in jquery. $("#theDiv").get() returns the DOM element, not wrapped in jquery
[12:37:34] <apassi> thanks
[12:37:54] <Whirl3d> michaelfavia, serially
[12:38:00] <Whirl3d> *sequentially
[12:38:33] <Whirl3d> though not always. Depends on if its asynchronous or not
[12:39:35] <Whirl3d> for example, $("el").animate(bunch of stuff).addClass("test")  will add the class "test" to the element before the animation ends
[12:42:16] <heoa> Whirl3d: why does it not change the size of the image?
[12:42:28] <heoa> When I press run...
[12:43:31] <Whirl3d> heoa, you need to spend some time understanding html elements first. map does not change the size of the img, only the clickcable area. Look it up.
[12:45:45] <p3rsist> Hi guys. I'm looking for a good templating library for backbone. You guys are using underscore.js micro templating? How is it?
[12:46:02] <p3rsist> sorry wrong channel*
[12:49:02] <ShaunR> i have a bunch of inputs with a names customfield[1], customfield[2], etc... i want to match all these, i tried $('input[name=customfield]') but it doesnt seem to be working, any ideas what i'm doign wrong?
[12:50:27] <BillCriswell> How would you guys approach this: I have a list of links on the left. Each link on the left corresponds to a point on the image on the right. I'd like to drew a line from the list item to that point.
[12:51:06] <BillCriswell> I'm wondering if I could get away without the line and just having a marker hidden over the image display...
[12:51:19] <NoiseEee> try $('input[name^="customfield"]
[12:51:25] <NoiseEee> try $('input[name^="customfield"]') ShaunR
[12:51:36] <I3ooI3oo> ShaunR: I don't think you can use [] in id names
[12:51:59] <zanberdo> I have an <a> node that I need to check for disabled. I had thought I could check the field directly a'la: $('#foo').attr('disabled') but all I get for this is 'undefined' even when disabled='disabled' in the <a> node. How should one check if a specific element is disabled?
[12:52:10] <ShaunR> NoiseEee: that did it, whats the ^ do?
[12:52:15] <NoiseEee> zanberdo: <a> tags can't be disabled!
[12:52:22] <zanberdo> NoiseEee, that explains it
[12:52:22] <NoiseEee> ShaunR: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/
[12:52:23] <BillCriswell> zanberdo: You can't disable a.
[12:52:30] <zanberdo> gotcha. my bad
[12:52:32] <BillCriswell> Damn, I'm slow.
[12:53:16] <ShaunR> NoiseEee: oh, nice it's simular to regex
[12:54:22] <ShaunR> only problem is i would really rather the match be more specific and not match other fields that may be named somthing like customfieldother
[12:54:53] <NoiseEee> ShaunR: then give the input's a class name that identifies them / groups them
[12:55:00] <I3ooI3oo> ShaunR: Then use Customfeild_1 Customfeild_2 ...
[12:55:15] <NoiseEee> ShaunR: or confine the selector to a parent element
[12:55:16] <BillCriswell> ShaunR: You might be able to do $('input[name^="customfield["]')
[12:55:26] <BillCriswell> It would all be better if you just added a class, though.
[12:55:44] <ShaunR> cant, i'm not controlling the html out
[12:55:51] <ShaunR> just trying to style it.
[12:55:53] <sarspazam> is .top() a jquery function?
[12:55:55] <ShaunR> using addClass
[12:55:59] <sarspazam> or is it just norm js
[12:55:59] <sarspazam> ?
[12:56:13] <BillCriswell> ShaunR: Try $('input[name^="customfield["]')
[12:57:51] <ShaunR> BillCriswell: that works too
[12:58:42] <BillCriswell> That'll keep customfieldfoo from being selected.
[12:58:54] <ShaunR> yep
[12:59:17] <shoky> my selecta
[12:59:48] <heoa> Whirl3d: el.prop("coords", [x1, y1, x2, y2].join(", ")); <-- what does this do? Is this an assignment with join?
[13:00:06] <heoa> el = el + join_the_new_vals?
[13:00:18] <shoky> it joins those 4 into a string, seperating them with commas
[13:00:30] <shoky> and sets that as the coords property of el
[13:01:30] <shoky> and boom
[13:01:46] <heoa> el.prop('coords') gets the values while this is an assignment, ok.
[13:02:06] <shoky> u r into it
[13:02:20] <shoky> get more into it
[13:02:26] <shoky> ?prop @ heoa
[13:02:27] <bot-t> heoa, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[13:02:38] <shoky> r u innit
[13:04:44] <Whirl3d> sorry, .join concats an array. It basically turns the array of coordinates into the string format needed for the area coords property
[13:04:47] <BillCriswell> ShaunR: $('input').filter(function(){ var $this = $(this); return /^customfield\[\d+\]$/.test($this.attr('name')); }).addClass('customjawn'); will do the trick as well
[13:05:15] <Whirl3d> shoky, sorry. Didn't see you had already answered. LOL
[13:05:31] <shoky> LoL
[13:08:59] <Emn1ty> So does anyone know a good way to the buttons beneath the slider animate the grey box (such as sliding out)? I looked into a few sliding methods but the only one that works wraps the text when it shrinks the div width. http://tinyurl.com/dxhhc92
[13:12:12] <shoky> can you repeat your first sentence. you kinda some words
[13:12:49] <thin> Emn1ty: white-space: no-wrap ?
[13:12:54] <Emn1ty> a good way to get the buttons to animate
[13:12:59] <Emn1ty> sich as slide out
[13:13:39] <Emn1ty> thin: It was colliding with the edge of a div, just decided to use no-wrap and a break to push the line down.
[13:14:51] <Emn1ty> shoky: essentially I want the grey box to slide out from the button.
[13:15:27] <Emn1ty> ah...
[13:15:38] <shoky> and what do you want to see behind the box while its sliding
[13:15:39] <Emn1ty> thin: you are a genious
[13:15:43] <shoky> ah
[13:16:02] <Emn1ty> genius*
[13:16:20] <ZeuZ> Hey all, I'm having troubles with a <td> element, that is being converted to a <input>, the previous .text() pased as value for <input>, and managing the keypress event (enter) so that it would read the modified text as a <td> again. However, something in the code is broken so hard, sometimes it even spits out 'undefined'. Live Prove: http://190.16.86.49 user:test password:test
[13:17:05] <shoky> replacing a <td> with an <input> .. ?
[13:17:20] <NoiseEee> bbbbbut... td's are table cells.
[13:17:23] <ZeuZ> shoky, just check it
[13:17:32] <NoiseEee> <tr><input> makes no sense / is invalid
[13:17:57] <koden> hey all can you take a look at this and tell me how to replace the language instead of just appending it to the link... http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:17:58] <ZeuZ> however it does "kind of" works
[13:18:08] <koden> http://jsfiddle.net/xQSKD/
[13:18:11] <koden> sorry about that
[13:19:09] <shoky> ZeuZ: and what do you want?
[13:19:26] <Emn1ty> koden: such as changing "test link" to its spanish translation?
[13:19:53] <koden> Emn1ty http://www.google.com/material/tipsheet/build?language=spanish should become http://www.google.com/material/tipsheet/build?language=english not http://www.google.com/material/tipsheet/build?language=spanish?language=english
[13:20:20] <ZeuZ> shoky, the idea is that after modifying the value it be shown
[13:20:24] <koden> so what is happening is that it is just appending to the link instead of replacing the parameter
[13:22:08] <ZeuZ> shoky, to be able to see the <table> you need to click "Inventario"
[13:22:31] <ZeuZ> then click the text in any of the <td> and it'll turn into a <input>
[13:22:47] <ZeuZ> with it's value passed from what it was in the td
[13:23:33] <shoky> ZeuZ it is very simple to do
[13:23:33] <koden> sorry if that is confusing Emn1ty
[13:23:42] <shoky> unless you are turning a <td> into an <input>
[13:23:46] <shoky> then you're on your own
[13:23:57] <ZeuZ> shoky, I'm in for advice then :P
[13:24:01] <ZeuZ> what would you suggest?
[13:24:11] <shoky> a simple way is
[13:24:16] <shoky> IN your <td>
[13:24:25] <shoky> to have a visible div, and an invisible one
[13:24:35] <shoky> and just switch between em from your code
[13:25:07] <shoky> or, you can just change the html or contents or whatever of the <td> into whatever you want
[13:25:13] <shoky> just DONT replace the <td> with something else
[13:25:18] <shoky> replace it's contents
[13:25:22] <shoky> its
[13:26:18] <ZeuZ> well the function currently replaces it, yes. But the idea of having two divs sounds like more practical
[13:27:27] <vork> fadeIn seems to require the element to be invisible to start with (display: none), but such an invisible element takes up no space. I want the element to take up space (visibility: hidden) before it is faded in. How can I do that?
[13:27:29] <shoky> go for it then
[13:31:29] <sorahn> if i have a variable that is an HTMLDivElement, is it possible to turn it into a jquery object?
[13:31:46] <vork> sorahn: $(x)
[13:31:54] <sorahn> that doesn't seem to be working.

[13:41:21] <sorahn> oh
[13:41:40] <Bertl> that is whit jquery 1.7.2
[13:41:45] <vork> sorahn: Maybe alert "$" to make sure that function's actually from jQuery.
[13:41:51] <shoky> sorahn: foo.find(...

[13:43:54] <shoky> you had strong
[13:44:01] <sorahn> yea
[13:44:06] <sorahn> i'm trying to change the one inside the tip element
[13:46:36] <Bertl> any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?
[13:47:15] <nFFF> what is $tip?
[13:47:39] <sorahn> nFFF: It's a HTMLDivElement created by bootstraip.  The element that it's going to show for the popover.
[13:48:49] <sorahn> oh hmm...  It's not putting the content in $tip when it creates it...
[13:49:15] <shoky> yah
[13:49:56] <ZeuZ> shoky, I'm following your advice of two divs, first problem rises because it's like it takes much more space than before. But that I can work around.
[13:49:59] <rosieres> how is a snip and append done ? is there a short solution ? Like: snip('#myArticle').append('#otherContainer'); ?
[13:50:27] <ZeuZ> shoky, the deal is: how do I refer to the proper div wich is hidden in the same td as the one that's visible?
[13:50:43] <Renacor> anybody here familiar with eventsource?
[13:51:09] <shoky> ZeuZ: put some class like 'active' on the active one
[13:51:25] <ZeuZ> shoky, not following you there
[13:51:32] <shoky> and you can refer to it with $('#myTable td .active')
[13:52:42] <shoky> like: $('#myTable td .active').removeClass('active').next().addClass('active')
[13:52:57] <shoky> and the active class could just be:  { display: block }
[13:53:10] <shoky> and by default you put on those divs display: none
[13:53:17] <shoky> whatever..
[13:55:32] <Bertl> can anybody read me?
[13:56:19] <sorahn> interesting
[13:56:33] <sorahn> it looks like the $tip html is empty until the popover is visible.

[14:02:06] <Renacor> Anybody know why an EventSource object would constantly fire an "open" event?
[14:02:18] <Alex83> hi. could someone take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/cKvvT/ bg isn't fading
[14:02:35] <Bertl> nFFF: the type="submit" already has a different name
[14:04:28] <dabear_> akahn: .nextAll(".bg").first()
[14:04:42] <akahn> thanks dabear_
[14:04:56] <cordoval> how to test if the value is null>? if ($hForm.find('select').attr('value')) { ?
[14:05:39] <johnkpaul> ?tias @cordoval
[14:05:39] <bot-t> cordoval, Try It And See
[14:06:01] <cordoval> ?tias?
[14:06:02] <bot-t> cordoval, Couldn't find "tias?" in jQuery Docs.
[14:06:05] <cordoval> oh
[14:06:25] <johnkpaul> ;)
[14:06:43] <Alex83> dabear_: works fine. thanks for help!
[14:06:57] <aksnowman> http://jsfiddle.net/QxeS2/2/ <-- in IE 9 the submit: event is not firing for me, anyone have any ideas why? :(
[14:07:06] <dabear_> Alex83: .next() only selects the immediately following sibling
[14:07:53] <aksnowman> erm, rather it doesn't fire in IE9 that hasn't entered developer console/bar/mode/whatever
[14:08:07] <ent0camel> Hi. I successfully made a JSONP request (cross domain). I receive the response (I can print it to the FireBug console), but I'm not able to embed it to the DOM. I'm not sure how I have to parse it or whatever. Any ideas? Tell me what information you need to help.
[14:08:25] <aksnowman> nvm, ignore me
[14:09:04] <nFFF> ?append @ ent0camel
[14:09:05] <bot-t> ent0camel, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:09:48] <heoa> how can I do "pause 5 seconds" here[11]?
[14:09:52] <Alex83> dabear_: ok. sometimes the selectors are confusing
[14:09:54] <heoa> [11] http://koti.kapsi.fi/he/Bugs/t.html
[14:09:58] <someprimetime> why are css pseudo selectors so damn slow?
[14:10:40] <pandeiro> why doesn't jquery have a $.trigger() for custom events that aren't bound to a specific dom element?
[14:10:50] <ent0camel> nFFF: : Yes, actually I would use $('#template').clone().append(...) - however, my problem is parsing the output to append it as a actual string
[14:11:30] <aksnowman> someprimetime: because they aren't being run as pure compiled code as true css selectors are, w/ the pseudo-selectors jquery cycles through *every* single object in the context you specify and checks for the pseudo-selector values/presense/whatever, if I remember correctly
[14:11:41] <nFFF> ent0camel, what is the server returning?
[14:11:50] <nFFF> what do you see in the console
[14:12:01] <ent0camel> nFFF: server response would look sth. like that
[14:12:03] <ent0camel> jQuery23({"article":{"barcode":977235},"article_master":{"name":"Book Master 7"},"student":{"name":"Cremin"}})
[14:12:21] <ent0camel> where jQuery23 is the callback
[14:12:22] <someprimetime> so it's basically because the js engine has to do the work twice?
[14:12:26] <Bertl> dabear_, nFFF: http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/bug.html
[14:12:44] <someprimetime> also, how come shit like -webkit-transition:all .4s; in pure css is also equally slow
[14:13:11] <aksnowman> someprimetime: that part I don't know, lol
[14:13:29] <aksnowman> I haven't done so much w/ css as I have javascript/PHP/etc
[14:14:05] <nFFF> ent0camel, ok so it returns a normal JSON
[14:14:15] <nFFF> what from the object do you want to access?
[14:14:23] <ent0camel> yes, but wrapped into a method
[14:14:46] <ent0camel> nFFF: e.g. I would like to add the barcode number to the DOM
[14:14:56] <ent0camel> nFFF : Any idea how to access that?
[14:15:04] <nFFF> ?parsejson @ ent0camel
[14:15:04] <bot-t> ent0camel, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:15:05] <ent0camel> I tried parseJSON and stuff
[14:15:40] <ent0camel> So I was right? Hm, okay. I'll try a little bit more with it.
[14:17:22] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/PRVAW/
[14:17:23] <ent0camel> Thanks so far, at least I know now that I'm using the correct method.
[14:17:24] <nFFF> works fine for me
[14:17:29] <dabear_> Bertl:  <input id="update" name="submit" type="submit" value="Update"><--wrong
[14:17:38] <dabear_> Bertl: name cannot be "submit"
[14:19:00] <nFFF> <Bertl> nFFF: the type="submit" already has a different name
[14:19:01] <nFFF> lol
[14:19:02] <nFFF> :>
[14:19:12] <ent0camel> nFFF: Thanks
[14:22:39] <Bertl> dabear_: ah, okay, I thought I already changed that, but obviously not ... thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
[14:33:44] <heoa> How can I make 5 second pause?

[14:36:24] <nFFF> pass your css as an object
[14:36:26] <ZeuZ> nFFF, care to share some light?

[14:44:22] <justspamjustin> Here is a question about jquery with iframes.  Why can't I use jquery to trigger a click event on an element in a child frame on the same domain? http://jsfiddle.net/pPnhV/
[14:45:44] <johnkpaul> justspamjustin: .click() will only trigger events that are added using jquery
[14:46:08] <johnkpaul> if you want to do that, you'll need to progrmaticaly create a click event
[14:46:11] <justspamjustin> johnkpaul:  That's good to know.  I didn't know that.
[14:46:27] <johnkpaul> well actually, what I said is a little imprecise
[14:46:40] <johnkpaul> .click() will not trigger a native action
[14:46:53] <johnkpaul> like you can't .click an anchor tag and have the page change
[14:47:03] <johnkpaul> and that is an anchor tag
[14:47:10] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery.simulate @justspamjustin
[14:47:11] <bot-t> justspamjustin, eduardolundgren/jquery-simulate · GitHub - https://github.com/eduardolundgren/jquery-simulate
[14:47:25] <johnkpaul> use that plugin, and you'll be able to .simulate("click")
[14:47:28] <johnkpaul> and that should work
[14:47:47] <ZeuZ> Ok, so now I'm definetly lost.
[14:47:51] <justspamjustin> That looks like a good solution.  I'll try it out.  Thanks.
[14:48:05] <ZeuZ> I've got a td, wich has two divs inside, one visible, the other not visible.
[14:48:11] <ZeuZ> What I've done is:
[14:48:45] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/ht64S/
[14:48:59] <Cluber> What's the syntax for creating my own function in jQuery. instead of the traditional function myname(){ blah {
[14:49:03] <Cluber> *}
[14:49:17] <ZeuZ> But this causes all kind of undesired effects when clicking other <td>s divs
[14:50:01] <ZeuZ> I'm out of clues. At first, I was matching the 'td' on 'click' and .html('<input>')
[14:50:16] <ZeuZ> That seemed a bad approach.
[14:50:30] <johnkpaul> Cluber: you mean a jquery plugin? jQuery.fn.yourPlugin =
[14:50:42] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery pluggin patterns addy @ Cluber
[14:50:44] <bot-t> Cluber, addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns · GitHub - https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[14:50:50] <ZeuZ> Now someone pointed out that I could just switch the divs, having one hidden.
[14:50:58] <ZeuZ> But I kind of not get how to do it
[14:53:16] <johnkpaul> ZeuZ: that jsfiddle doesn't really explain what you're trying to do
[14:53:32] <Cluber>  johnkpaul: I mean, in standard javascript I write functions. Instead of writing them the traditional way and calling them with functionName(argument1, argument2);
[14:54:07] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't stop you from being able to do that, Cluber
[14:55:00] <Cluber> johnkpaul: I know it doesn't, but I was asking if jQuery has another syntax for this
[14:55:14] <Cluber> for you to define your own functions
[14:55:43] <johnkpaul> another syntax? jquery doesn't change the javascript language
[14:55:43] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs @ Cluber
[14:55:44] <bot-t> Cluber, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[14:55:49] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: are you going to the thing tonight
[14:55:56] <johnkpaul> :D, of course the bot has something!
[14:55:59] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: yes, I am
[14:56:07] <ajpiano> lol
[14:56:08] <ajpiano> me too
[14:56:10] <ajpiano> leaving here shortly
[14:56:24] <johnkpaul> yeah, me too
[14:56:27] <johnkpaul> I don't have a laptop though
[14:56:33] <johnkpaul> uhoh
[14:56:33] <ajpiano> UR GONNA BE IN BIG TRUBZ
[14:56:42] <ZeuZ> johnkpaul, the idea is one of the divs to become invisible, and the previously invisible one to become visible
[14:56:52] <johnkpaul> I might get kicked out, I'll make a scene
[14:56:53] <ZeuZ> both divs are inside a <td>
[14:57:43] <johnkpaul> ok, what I'd probably do is something like $("td").toggleClass("active")
[14:57:48] <johnkpaul> and then use your css to hide and show what you need to
[14:58:38] <ZeuZ> that obligates me to define an "active" class on the stylesheet, I follow that
[15:00:29] <ZeuZ> in any case, allready been there, I might be doing something wrong but that goes to no avail
[15:00:36] <ZeuZ> Live test here:
[15:01:02] <ZeuZ> http://190.16.86.49 user:test password:test
[15:01:12] <ZeuZ> I should remove the login until I get the hang of this thing
[15:04:45] <johnkpaul> ZeuZ: firs tthing I notice is that you have multiple tables with the same id
[15:04:54] <johnkpaul> you can only have one element with one id per page
[15:05:57] <ZeuZ> johnkpaul, yeah I just changed that to refer to a class inside the stylesheet
[15:06:13] <johnkpaul> so that might be the cause of some of your issues
[15:06:17] <johnkpaul> I actuall y need to head out
[15:06:22] <johnkpaul> but keep working at it
[15:29:11] <ZeuZ> Ok, so I'm either stupid or too baffled by this.
[15:29:24] <azk> is someone willing to take a look at this
[15:29:26] <azk> http://tiger.iriscouch.com/csv/_design/Siggi/index.html
[15:30:22] <ZeuZ> I've got two divs, one with display:none, and the other with display:block. inactive, and active, respectively. Both divs are inside a td. Upon click, I want the active one wich is shown first to be removed, and the inactive one to be shown
[15:32:11] <ZeuZ> How, by the love of God, can I toggle the currently shown so that the other one appears?
[15:33:14] <ZeuZ> Or, in other words, how can I "swap" the classes they belong to?
[15:33:45] <gener1c> make a function
[15:34:48] <gnarf> ZeuZ: toggle both of them?
[15:35:02] <gnarf> $(".inactive,.active").toggleClass("active inactive") ?
[15:35:40] <ZeuZ> gnarf, the inactive class is defined as display:none;
[15:35:54] <gener1c> why not simply use toggle?
[15:36:14] <gnarf> you could use .toggle, but so long as you have classes that are already descriptive of state, why not use them
[15:36:43] <gener1c> because there is a puedo class for that
[15:37:35] <gener1c> $(".togglers").toggle();
[15:37:54] <gener1c> and if you want in any state to turn em both on
[15:38:17] <gener1c> $(".togglers").filter(:hidden).show()
[15:38:37] <gnarf> gener1c: .toggle( true )
[15:38:51] <gener1c> true?
[15:38:58] <gnarf> .toggle( true ) === .show()
[15:39:06] <gnarf> .toggle( false ) === .hide()
[15:39:17] <gener1c> why would i choose to be a ninja and make my code unreadable?
[15:39:37] <gnarf> also, why bother with the .filter(":hidden")
[15:39:40] <gnarf> just .show()
[15:39:44] <gener1c> plus you could simply do
[15:39:53] <gener1c> $(".togglers").filter(:hidden).toggle()
[15:39:57] <gnarf> gener1c: .toggle( bool ) isn't unreadable
[15:40:04] <gener1c> or show on both
[15:40:36] <ZeuZ> Just gimme a break to try to catch my brain-air and explain the situation.
[15:41:01] <ZeuZ> The script takes an AJAX request and upon success, creates a table.
[15:41:03] <gener1c> i cant argue with that logis gnarf
[15:41:08] <gener1c> logic*
[15:41:28] <ZeuZ> That table has one visible div, and one not visible.
[15:41:34] <gener1c> ok
[15:41:57] <ZeuZ> The idea is swap them, the visible one make it invisible, and the invisible one make it visible
[15:42:14] <ZeuZ> (for each td that is clicked, that is)
[15:42:37] <ZeuZ> the visible one is defined by display:block;
[15:42:40] <gnarf> ZeuZ: select both and .toggle()
[15:42:43] <gnarf> ?toggle
[15:42:44] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[15:42:55] <ZeuZ> Tried that
[15:43:09] <ZeuZ> $(this).toggle('inactivo activo');
[15:43:12] <gener1c> do it inside the success callback
[15:43:13] <ZeuZ> and it removes the element
[15:43:18] <gnarf> ZeuZ: thats wrong
[15:43:20] <gener1c> what?
[15:43:23] <gnarf> ?toggleClass
[15:43:24] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[15:43:29] <ZeuZ> Also tried that
[15:43:34] <gnarf> also you are only operating on one of them
[15:43:35] <gener1c> just empty toggle
[15:43:37] <gnarf> you need to select both
[15:43:41] <ZeuZ> remember that the inactive class css is defined by just display:none
[15:43:56] <gener1c> ZeuZ:
[15:44:04] <gener1c> make em have the same class
[15:44:11] <gener1c> something like
[15:44:28] <gener1c> class="toggleme"
[15:44:43] <gener1c> $('.toggleme').toggle()
[15:44:53] <ZeuZ> The thing is that then BOTH will be shown upon first load, and I DON'T want that to happen.
[15:44:58] <gener1c> yeah i know
[15:45:05] <gener1c> you can choose one of em
[15:45:15] <ZeuZ> how?
[15:45:26] <gener1c> $('').eq(index)
[15:45:31] <gener1c> $('').first()
[15:45:39] <gener1c> $('').last()
[15:45:41] <gener1c> u name it
[15:45:47] <gener1c> read the api man
[15:46:00] <gener1c> you can even select em without a class
[15:46:28] <ZeuZ> ?
[15:46:49] <gener1c> $('table#blah td')
[15:46:58] <jn_> Hi I use the following snippet to resize my div on document load, is it possible to resize the div when the window is resized ? http://pastebin.com/qkYpmpJD
[15:46:59] <gener1c> css is magic
[15:47:03] <gnarf> ZeuZ: http://jsfiddle.net/5EQMy/ -- notice that if you use the .toggle() first, the classes don't work because it manually sets style properties
[15:47:16] <gener1c> nice
[15:48:28] <ZeuZ> That confused the hell out of me, worse
[15:48:39] <ZeuZ> Just let me get this straight:
[15:48:47] <ZeuZ> the PHP script will output both as the same class.
[15:49:04] <ZeuZ> That makes them both VISIBLE upon first request. Wich is not what I want.
[15:49:05] <gnarf> no, one should still be hidden on page load right?
[15:49:12] <ZeuZ> Exactly
[15:49:15] <gnarf> you do realize you can have more than one class on a single element right?
[15:49:24] <gnarf> <div class="inactive toggler">
[15:49:28] <ZeuZ> eh, nope :P
[15:49:41] <gnarf> <div class="active toggler">
[15:49:57] <gnarf> $(".toggler").toggleClass( "active inactive" ) is one way to do it
[15:50:02] <gnarf> that still uses your CSS to handle display
[15:50:24] <gnarf> if you just use .toggle() you will end up setting style="display: none;" or style="display: block" on the elements
[15:50:47] <gnarf> which will probably work, but then they will still have the wrong inactive/active state class on them
[15:51:16] <gnarf> which is why I suggested, if you already had an inactive and active class, that you use .toggleClass( "active inactive" )
[15:51:54] <gnarf> also, you really don't need the second class
[15:51:55] <ZeuZ> tried that just now, and to the same effect
[15:52:01] <gnarf> you can just select things...
[15:52:07] <gnarf> ZeuZ: thats cuz you are doing $( this )
[15:52:09] <gnarf> still
[15:52:11] <gnarf> probably
[15:52:21] <ZeuZ> yes sir xD
[15:52:24] <gnarf> you need to select both the active and inactive items
[15:52:26] <ZeuZ> what should I be doing?
[15:52:49] <ZeuZ> just $.toggleClass() ?
[15:52:56] <gnarf> no
[15:52:56] <gener1c> :P
[15:53:02] <gnarf> select the elements you want to toggle
[15:53:30] <gnarf> it might be something like $( this ).closest( ".container" ).find( ".active,.inactive" ).toggleClass( "active inactive" )
[15:53:34] <gnarf> ?closest
[15:53:34] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:53:35] <gnarf> ?find
[15:53:35] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:54:26] <gener1c> wow i didnt know it existed
[15:54:40] <gener1c> i always used .parents().filter(selector)
[15:54:49] <gener1c> thanks gnarf
[15:54:50] <ZeuZ> You did mention I didn't really need another class. How would that work out?
[15:54:55] <gnarf> gener1c: thats super dangerous
[15:55:15] <gener1c> because if the parent doesnt exist it will be O(N)?
[15:55:20] <gnarf> ZeuZ: .find( ".active,.inactive" ) <-- that selects things that match ".active" or ".inactive"
[15:55:40] <gnarf> gener1c: 1) it has to traverse all the way up every time, 2) it can have multiple matches
[15:55:49] <gnarf> gener1c: closest stops on the first match
[15:56:01] <gnarf> ?comma selector

[15:56:19] <gnarf> ^^^^ @ZeuZ
[15:56:30] <ZeuZ> What I don't understand is how if .inactive is defined as display:none how togglin' it will result in it SHOWING UP?
[15:56:56] <gener1c> it swaps the classes between the elements
[15:57:02] <jn_> How can adjust div width when the browser window is resized ?
[15:57:05] <gnarf> ZeuZ: really? toggleClass will remove any listed classes that already exist, and add any listed classes that don't
[15:57:26] <gnarf> so something that is "active" when you .toggleClass( "active inactive" ) will lose active, and gain inactive
[15:57:30] <ZeuZ> gnarf, the other class is set to NOT show, that's how it's defined in the stylesheet
[15:57:40] <ZeuZ> oh
[15:57:46] <ZeuZ> I think I begin to understand heeh
[15:58:06] <gnarf> good, now let me attack you with these standard "welcome to jQuery" links:
[15:58:07] <gnarf> ?101
[15:58:08] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[15:58:09] <gnarf> ?learn
[15:58:09] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:58:27] <gnarf> all three of those resources are excellent
[15:58:40] <gener1c> nice!
[15:58:44] <gener1c> you use MDC
[15:58:58] <gnarf> gener1c: MDN? :)
[15:59:02] <gener1c> sorry
[15:59:04] <gener1c> MDN
[16:00:12] <gener1c> is there a more elaborate read about some of the functions mentioned in the jquery api?
[16:00:29] <gener1c> or maybe more elaborate examples
[16:00:38] <gnarf> gener1c: the documentation is pretty damn solid on api.jquery.com
[16:00:50] <gener1c> some of the examples dont cover it all the way
[16:00:54] <gener1c> like .data()
[16:01:01] <gener1c> or some of the ajax methods
[16:01:14] <gnarf> ask?
[16:01:33] <gnarf> jqfundamentals has a lot of that
[16:01:50] <gener1c> well i have an issue right now with a plugin rather than the standard stuff
[16:02:27] <ZeuZ> $("inactivo").toggleClass("activo"); ---> x'D Nope, no workie, I think I just need to take a break, and look again at the .toggle() reference
[16:02:33] <gener1c> tinyscrollbar
[16:02:46] <gener1c> ZeuZ: are you trolling?
[16:02:47] <gnarf> ZeuZ: a) "inactivo" is a selector that looks for a <inactivo> tag
[16:03:07] <gnarf> ZeuZ: b) you need to toggle BOTH CLASSES so that you shut off inactivo, and turn on activo
[16:03:12] <ZeuZ> gener1c, no, I'm just retarded enough
[16:03:21] <gnarf> ?demo @ZeuZ
[16:03:21] <gener1c> listen
[16:03:22] <bot-t> ZeuZ, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:03:27] <gener1c> go to gnarf's code
[16:03:31] <gener1c> it hits the spot
[16:03:41] <gener1c> JQuery === $
[16:03:55] <gener1c> so no worries about his explicit use of the name
[16:03:58] <ZeuZ> gener1c, if I could understand what that did, but back then, I allready had an answer for that: I don't
[16:04:20] <gener1c> ok
[16:04:42] <gener1c> do you know css selector basics?
[16:05:31] <ZeuZ> I would beleave so, but right now, after so much fiddling, scrubling, and dwidling, I'm like lost
[16:05:39] <blindMoe> do you guys recommend using jqueryboilerplate.com or stegan gabos' version for plugin boilerplate template?
[16:05:40] <gener1c> ok
[16:05:40] <ZeuZ> so gimme a second to take back some air
[16:05:53] <gener1c> then all you need to know in this case is
[16:05:58] <blindMoe> or is there yet another version that is even better ?
[16:06:10] <gener1c> when you want to use the same css for alot of selectors
[16:06:24] <gener1c> you just seperate them with commas and write the block after that
[16:06:25] <gener1c> like so
[16:06:46] <gener1c> .class1, .class2, #id1, #id2 {}
[16:06:52] <gener1c> its that simple
[16:07:16] <gener1c> what jquery does is that it uses the same syntax css uses to grab those elements
[16:07:48] <gener1c> so to grab both active and inactive all you need to do is
[16:08:03] <gener1c> $('.active, .inactive')
[16:08:27] <gener1c> the result here is an array of all elements that have 1 or both of those classes
[16:08:57] <gener1c> in your case its 2 elements
[16:09:10] <gener1c> then all you need to do is
[16:09:38] <gener1c> $('.active, .inactive').toggleClass('active inactive')
[16:09:45] <gener1c> which will swap the 2 classes around
[16:10:08] <gener1c> and move the corresponding css to each of those elements accordingly
[16:10:23] <ZeuZ> Ok, now I get that.
[16:11:03] <ZeuZ> However, then, if I refer to them as $(".activo, .inactivo").toggle() all elements in all <td> will be changed, and I just need the clicked one to change
[16:11:32] <gener1c> if you use toggle() something else will happen
[16:11:40] <gener1c> toggle() != toggleClass()
[16:12:10] <gener1c> now i understand what you are talking about
[16:12:18] <gener1c> you have more than 2
[16:13:14] <gnarf> ZeuZ: we really need to see this html / the issue
[16:13:24] <gnarf> it will make it 100* easier to tell you what needs to happen
[16:13:27] <gnarf> ?demo @ZeuZ
[16:13:28] <bot-t> ZeuZ, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:13:41] <ZeuZ> here goes:
[16:13:54] <gnarf> don't you DARE paste the whole thing here
[16:13:54] <ZeuZ> http://190.16.86.49
[16:13:56] <gnarf> :)
[16:13:59] <gnarf> okay good
[16:14:01] <ZeuZ> user:test pass:test
[16:14:50] <gnarf> that just gets me to a mostly empty document
[16:14:52] <gener1c> ok i dont understnad what im seeing here to tell you the truth
[16:15:08] <shoelessone> anybody know if you can make a jsonp cross site ajax call from a secure (https) to an unsecure (http) site? Or visa versa?
[16:15:22] <ZeuZ> gener1c, just click "Inventario"
[16:16:18] <gnarf> okay so ZeuZ I assume your "click" event is tied to a TD?
[16:16:36] <ZeuZ> right
[16:16:43] <gnarf> then you want to use jQuery( this ).find( ".activo,.inactivo").toggleClass("activo inactivo")
[16:16:49] <gnarf> ?find @ZeuZ
[16:16:50] <bot-t> ZeuZ, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[16:17:01] <gnarf> the TD ( this ) contains those other two elements
[16:17:03] <gnarf> so search for them
[16:20:08] <ZeuZ> Now the idea would be that if it has been clicked once, it shouldn't swap again (I'll bind a keypress event for that later)
[16:20:35] <ZeuZ> can I just: if(this.data('clicked'))return; ?
[16:21:28] <gnarf> ?one @ZeuZ
[16:21:28] <bot-t> ZeuZ, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[16:21:59] <gnarf> but yes, you could also use .data('clicked') and store a boolean
[16:22:32] <gnarf> although it should probably be on jQuery( this ) not just this
[16:34:15] <ZeuZ> gnarf, yeah, I meant to write: if ($(this).data('clicked')) return;
[16:34:49] <ZeuZ> On top of the $(this).find(....)
[16:34:56] <ZeuZ> But it won't work.
[16:35:12] <ZeuZ> It'll keep switching them. Tried forcing cache flush but to no avail.
[16:37:10] <gnarf> did you ever set $(this).data('clicked') ?
[16:37:20] <gnarf> did you ever set $(this).data('clicked', true) rather?
[16:37:44] <gnarf> before you try getting all crazy with a function call as a LHS assignment
[16:42:05] <ZeuZ> gnarf, this time I can finally say: Yes I did ^_^
[16:42:23] <ZeuZ> Tried it in another browser just to make sure and it worked
[16:42:36] <ZeuZ> so, firefox is perhaps tired of me? he
[16:42:49] <gnarf> Chrome for the win
[16:42:56] <ios_software_eng> Hi
[16:43:00] <gnarf> ?devtools
[16:43:00] <bot-t> Paul Irish - A Reintroduction to the Chrome Developer Tools - http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[16:43:04] <gnarf> watch that
[16:44:44] <ZeuZ> I do have one problem with two mobile browsers, since they use tap to zoom, the click-to-change doesn't work
[16:45:00] <ZeuZ> but screw that, this is me getting to know jQuery basically
[16:45:07] <blindMoe> ?boilerplate
[16:45:11] <bot-t> blindMoe, #10828 (attr("coords") returns undefined in IE7) – jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 5 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10828
[16:56:28] <blindMoe> anyone mind taking a look at this and see if they can shed light on why in my hover() the $(el).children(defaults.selDesc) is returning null in the console?  I think my eyes are fried and I am probably missing something easy  http://jsfiddle.net/LhXAr/
[16:57:21] <blindMoe> do I have to do a .each() on it and apply the css while iterating through the array?  Figured it wouldn't be needed
[16:58:16] <shoelessone> blindMoe: clicking...
[16:59:00] <blindMoe> shoelessone: thanks
[17:00:40] <blindMoe> oh jeez
[17:00:52] <blindMoe> shoelessone: I got it? I just switched $(el) to $(element) and it works
[17:01:13] <blindMoe> apparently I was wrong in understanding how (el) was being passed in by the hover function
[17:01:20] <blindMoe> oh event
[17:01:22] <shoelessone> gotcha
[17:01:41] <blindMoe> thanks for taking the time to look though
[17:01:42] <shoelessone> I would have thought "this" would have been something
[17:01:48] <shoelessone> Yeah of course! sorry I wasn't any help!
[17:01:59] <blindMoe> I tried 4(this) initially but it was acting odd
[17:02:24] <blindMoe> oh wtf? $(this) is working now as well
[17:02:31] * blindMoe needs to grab a beer and get some sleep :)
[17:02:47] <gnarf> blindMoe: I'm not a big fan on that widget pattern
[17:02:52] <shoelessone> Yeah, I don't know. I think the first parameter is the index
[17:02:57] <shoelessone> though I could be wrong
[17:02:59] <gnarf> blindMoe: (var) element = element; ????
[17:03:26] <gnarf> blindMoe: element is a function parameter, its already a "scoped variable"
[17:03:36] <blindMoe> it was the Stefan Gabos boilerplate template
[17:03:43] <gnarf> blindMoe: you should look at the UI Widget Factory
[17:03:47] <blindMoe> http://stefangabos.ro/jquery/jquery-plugin-boilerplate-revisited/
[17:03:48] <gnarf> ?widget factory
[17:03:49] <bot-t> gnarf, UI/Developer Guide - ui.core.js provides a factory method to create widget classes. The signature is $.widget(String name, Options prototype). http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[17:04:05] <blindMoe> i'll check it out
[17:04:06] <blindMoe> thanks
[17:04:12] <gnarf> ?g adam sontag widget factory
[17:04:12] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery UI Widget Factory - adam j. sontag - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[17:04:34] <blindMoe> man I knew aj had one
[17:04:45] <blindMoe> couldn't remember where it was.. when I asked in here no one answered :)
[17:04:49] <blindMoe> I'll conver it over right now
[17:10:30] <gener1c> so where is adam j?
[17:24:02] <azk> https://gist.github.com/2504452 am I going the wrong way about assigning this variable
[17:25:47] <devnill> does anyone know how to make .on() bind to future elements similar to .live()?
[17:26:27] <systemfault> Sure
[17:26:49] <devnill> I've been trying to figure it out with no luck
[17:26:51] <systemfault> $(parentElement).on('click', 'selectorHere', function(){});
[17:26:58] <gnarf> devnill: so $( selector ).live( "click", handler ) is the same as $( document ).on( "click", selector, handler )
[17:27:05] <gnarf> using document is probably overkill
[17:27:23] <gnarf> it is best to .on() on some parent element that you know won't change -  see @systemfault ^^^
[17:27:29] <azk> anyone look at my example?
[17:28:29] <devnill> my statement is $("input,a").on("click",function(event){
[17:28:33] <gnarf> azk: I have no idea -- a) I know not what an expected "data" response looks like, b) I know not how you are planning on using said "variable"
[17:29:01] <gnarf> devnill: so jQuery( "input, a" ) <--- that is looking for all inputs and a's currently in the page when it runs
[17:29:05] <gnarf> you want to do something like
[17:29:20] <azk> gnarf: data is a json object, I'm getting errors telling me that the value of said object is undefined
[17:29:26] <gnarf> jQuery( "#ajaxArea" ).on( "click", "input, a", handler );
[17:29:33] <gnarf> azk: see a)
[17:29:45] <gnarf> console.log( data1 )
[17:29:54] <devnill> so the second param is what to trigger?
[17:30:01] <devnill> that makes sense!
[17:30:18] <gnarf> devnill: .on( eventName, [ selector, ] handler );
[17:30:38] <gnarf> ?on @devnill
[17:30:38] <bot-t> devnill, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:31:10] <devnill> I was looking at that and the .live page but missed the selector param
[17:31:23] <systemfault> devnill: If you want to understand how it works then read on event delegation and event bubbling  (Just saying...)
[17:34:14] <devnill> I appreciate the help
[17:41:55] <blindMoe> is there a method to get the offset of an item based off the actual top / left of the parent item w/o the parent item's padding involved?
[17:42:31] <blindMoe> ie: if the parent padding is 10px, the first element seems to return 0 as position.top instead of 10
[17:44:46] <cheako> Hello, I don't think jquery is the right tool for this, but several have said so.  I'm looking to send SYN packets to trigger a Port Knocker written for a browser.
[17:45:33] <cheako> This big error(punn) I'm having is that in this case port closed is success and timed out is fatal(start over)
[17:45:55] <cheako> Can jquery do this, simply?
[17:47:11] <cheako> I've a good start using XMLHttpRequest, but it's not being fruitful as of late.  http://184.106.181.61/PortKnock.htm
[17:49:24] <gnarf> blindMoe: subtract the .offset() of each?
[17:51:06] <myke> noob here, using validationEngine, one of my fields is also tied to a calendar popup, both by way of the input's class: class="validate[required] datefield text-input", but when a date is picked validationEngine still sees the field as empty, how do i properly set this up so the input field is changed before validation is attempted?
[17:52:34] <ndimatteo> anyone interested in helping me debug some javascript?
[17:52:44] <ndimatteo> I'm willing to throw some beer money at you if you are.
[17:52:47] <StevenCodes> ndimatteo,  for 99 cets
[17:52:56] <ndimatteo> haha
[17:53:18] <gnarf> ?ask @ndimatteo
[17:53:18] <bot-t> ndimatteo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:53:19] <gnarf> :)
[17:53:31] <gnarf> describe issue?
[17:53:46] <StevenCodes> ?love @StevenCodes
[17:53:47] <bot-t> StevenCodes, â™¥ U
[17:53:51] <StevenCodes> LOL!
[17:54:01] <ndimatteo> thanks bot-t, new here :)
[17:54:10] <StevenCodes> hey was talking to me
[17:54:13] <StevenCodes> thats my baby
[17:54:15] <StevenCodes> lol
[17:54:18] <gnarf> thanks bot-t
[17:54:18] <bot-t> ;)
[17:54:26] <devnill> so it turns out that the $.on() function was also being killed because i had event.stopPropagation() on another selector that affected the same element
[17:54:30] <StevenCodes> bot-t how old are you ?
[17:54:38] <StevenCodes> hmm
[17:54:39] <ndimatteo> using a modified version of this history.js gist: https://gist.github.com/854622
[17:54:52] <gnarf> bot-t: how old are you?
[17:54:53] <bot-t> gnarf, Don't count on it.
[17:54:57] <ndimatteo> to power a wordpress site, having some errors with it in ie
[17:55:11] <ndimatteo> you can check it out here: marmaras.nickdimatteo.com
[17:55:41] <gnarf> "some errors" ?
[17:55:43] <systemfault> ndimatteo: What is the error....
[17:56:01] <systemfault> My crystal ball is out of service.
[17:56:24] <ndimatteo> '5' is null or not an object (main.js Line: 527)
[17:56:54] <ndimatteo> seems to be erroring on my regex to pull the first piece of the string after the '/'
[17:57:24] <ndimatteo> there's another bug happening where instead of using clean urls for the window.location it's throwing hashes in, which I'm wondering if that's playing a part in the first error
[17:57:39] <ndimatteo> ie. it should be /our-team, but in ie. it'll spit out /#our-team
[17:57:47] <gnarf> so um
[17:57:52] <gnarf> main.js is totally minified for me
[17:58:01] <jrockjiggz> its this error:
[17:58:01] <jrockjiggz> var exp = window.location.href.split(/^(([^:\/?#]+):)?(\/\/([^\/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?/);
[17:58:01] <jrockjiggz> 		var firstPortion = exp[5].split("/")[1];
[17:58:12] <systemfault> gnarf: There's two "main.js"
[17:58:17] <ndimatteo> and then if you go to another page from /our-team, it appends it after that, rather than replacing (/#our-team/#financial-planning
[17:58:18] <jrockjiggz> exp[5] i would think is a single char, so how are you to split it?
[17:58:18] <gnarf> aha!
[17:58:51] <chicocvenancio> does regex work in atribute selectors?
[17:59:05] <ndimatteo> i grabbed that regex from a stack overflow question
[17:59:08] <ndimatteo> let me see if I can find it
[17:59:14] <jrockjiggz> chicocvenancio: you'd have to use $('el').filter( function(){ this.match('regex') });
[17:59:54] <gnarf> so that means that exp doesn't match
[18:00:09] <chicocvenancio> jrockjiggz: thanks, its just 3 cases, I think its better to write them out
[18:00:26] <gnarf> trying to unroll that location.href.split regexp...
[18:00:43] <ndimatteo> if I console.log that it gives me an output
[18:01:01] <gnarf> ndimatteo: exp?
[18:01:33] <ndimatteo> yes
[18:02:02] <ndimatteo> exp. length returns 11
[18:02:21] <ndimatteo> both exp and firstPortion return a value
[18:02:43] <jrockjiggz> ndimatteo: can you paste what value exp is
[18:03:31] <gnarf> what is exp[5] in particular
[18:03:40] <gnarf> compare it to what exp[5] is in chrome
[18:03:46] <ndimatteo> ok
[18:03:47] <ndimatteo> hold on
[18:04:09] <batmanian> I already have a Web app designed for desktop browsers. If I want to support a rich experience on mobile devices using jQuery Mobile without affecting the way my site looks on desktop browsers, do I have to create a seperate set of html pages?
[18:04:13] <gnarf> thats a pretty silly regular expression though
[18:04:23] <gnarf> you are trying to get the "page" right?
[18:04:46] <ndimatteo> yes, the issue is that on sub pages I need it to know it's parent
[18:04:57] <ndimatteo> that's what that regex was for, to break it apart and get it
[18:05:20] <gnarf> ndimatteo: from the current page location?
[18:05:30] <ndimatteo> using my local copy at smith.site/, exp returns: ,http:,http,//smith.site,smith.site,/,,,,,
[18:06:04] <ndimatteo> on our clear value proposition it returns:
[18:06:04] <ndimatteo> ,http:,http,//smith.site,smith.site,/our-clear-value-proposition/,,,,,
[18:07:41] <gnarf> .split ??
[18:08:03] <gnarf> that seems like a very very strange "split"
[18:08:13] <gnarf> should that maybe be .exec() ?
[18:08:18] <gnarf> or .match()
[18:08:25] <gnarf> ?g mdn String.match
[18:08:26] <bot-t> gnarf, match - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[18:09:18] <gnarf> the window.location.href.match( re )
[18:09:23] <gnarf> ndimatteo: ^^^
[18:11:16] <ndimatteo> so I should replace .split with .match?
[18:11:29] <gnarf> ndimatteo: it seems more like what you want
[18:11:37] <gnarf> ndimatteo: not sure that will fix any problems
[18:11:43] <gnarf> ndimatteo: or maybe create its own
[18:11:48] <ndimatteo> i can give it a try :)
[18:12:17] <gnarf> but the docs on String.split() mention that the .split( re ) with capturing groups isn't supported in "all browsers"
[18:12:25] <gnarf> lame that there isn't a support graph for it
[18:13:05] <ndimatteo> shit.
[18:14:08] <gnarf> but it seems .match() is really what you meant
[18:14:27] <gnarf> you didn't need to find more than one of them
[18:14:35] <lorph> can i add variables to jquery instances? like $('#foo')._something = 123
[18:14:52] <gnarf> ?data @lorph
[18:14:52] <bot-t> lorph, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[18:14:59] <lorph> oh ok thanks
[18:15:28] <gnarf> $('#foo') !== $('#foo') --- they are not the same object so setting a property on it is kinda pointless
[18:15:37] <gnarf> so use .data()
[18:16:03] <lorph> thank you
[18:16:56] <ndimatteo> ok back
[18:17:06] <ndimatteo> so that's definitely an improvement :)
[18:17:13] <ndimatteo> the site actually loads without any errors
[18:17:21] <ndimatteo> but it's unleashed a few new ones.
[18:18:16] <ndimatteo> big one is that the slider and active state of the nav (sliding blue bar) doesn't update on page change.
[18:18:22] <ndimatteo> but I think it's because of the hash
[18:18:27] <gnarf> ndimatteo: btw - you might want to consider setting overflow-x: hidden on the body during that transition
[18:18:46] <ndimatteo> ok!
[18:19:12] <ndimatteo> when you do a page change in IE, the url is /#our-team
[18:19:16] <ndimatteo> instead of /our-team
[18:19:23] <gnarf> yeah
[18:19:27] <ndimatteo> everything updates with /our-team
[18:19:30] <gnarf> it doesn't have window.history()
[18:19:36] <gnarf> ndimatteo: what handles that?
[18:20:09] <gnarf> ndimatteo: because you could do window.location.href.replace("#", "") instead of just href
[18:20:23] <ndimatteo> good idea.
[18:21:09] <ndimatteo> not exactly sure where to implement that though
[18:21:35] <ndimatteo> anything to do with this: document.location.href = url;
[18:21:53] <gnarf> ndimatteo: prolly not thats the other way around ;)
[18:22:05] <gnarf> its the stuff that updates the "active" class I take it?
[18:22:13] <ndimatteo> yes
[18:22:14] <ndimatteo> :)
[18:22:32] <gnarf> you're looking for something that uses "location.href"
[18:22:39] <gnarf> to match the current link
[18:22:45] <gnarf> or something similar
[18:23:03] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[18:23:40] <gnarf> ndimatteo: https://gist.github.com/6f9793d829cf149aabfb
[18:23:45] <gnarf> ndimatteo: that section seems wrong
[18:24:00] <jackp10> can someon explain to me why the following code: alert($(this).attr("class")); right after the .click event returns the actual class, whether if i place the same line within the $.ajax "success" status it returns "undefined" ?
[18:24:32] <gnarf> ndimatteo: that href attribute match is kinda bad
[18:24:45] <ndimatteo> yea, it's super dirty haha. any suggestions?
[18:24:48] <gnarf> ndimatteo: also, because of the # you have issues
[18:25:54] <gnarf> ndimatteo: that regexp is stripping the # part into a different place than exp[5]
[18:26:34] <ndimatteo> damn.
[18:26:56] <gnarf> ndimatteo: you could prolly do .replace("#","").match( re )
[18:27:23] <jackp10> any idea ?
[18:27:35] <gnarf> jackp10: this
[18:27:45] <gnarf> jackp10: "this" in an ajax callback is the jqXHR
[18:28:03] <gnarf> jackp10: in the click event, var elem = jQuery( this ); then reference elem in the callback
[18:29:43] <gnarf> ndimatteo: you could probably do $( "a" ).filter( function() { this.pathname == firstPart } ) to be "safer" than the $( "a[href=....]" ) test
[18:30:23] <gnarf> ndimatteo: you could probably do $( "a" ).filter( function() { this.pathname.indexOf( firstPart ) > -1 } ) to be "safer" than the $( "a[href=....]" ) test
[18:30:58] <azk> gnarf: thx for pointing me in the right direction
[18:31:03] <jackp10> gnarf: so to be able to reference the "this" taken right after the .click event, but from the inside the $.ajax call, i need to assign it to a variable like : var ref = $(this); and then from inside the $.ajax just do: ref.attr("class") right ?
[18:31:36] <ndimatteo> any chance you could issue a pull request for that?
[18:31:46] <ndimatteo> I have all of this up on github
[18:31:57] <jackp10> gnarf: here is the code i am using: http://pastebin.com/V11ugLrB
[18:31:58] <ndimatteo> I feel like I'd entirely screw up implementing what you just said.
[18:32:53] <gnarf> ndimatteo: https://gist.github.com/5bedab1802fe3f4daed9
[18:34:50] <ndimatteo> gnarf: thanks, what about for the .match up higher in the file?
[18:35:02] <ndimatteo> line 440 of main.js
[18:35:39] <gnarf> you could prolly do the same "safeHref" thing there too
[18:36:25] <gnarf> ndimatteo: btw - thats indicative of a place to refactor code ;)
[18:37:13] <ndimatteo> yea, it kills me seeing it like that. I had to rush the shit out of this project, I'm not even sure at this point how to fix that.
[18:37:46] <gnarf> ndimatteo: avoid copy pasta ;)
[18:38:48] <gnarf> function currentPath() { var safeHref = location.href.replace("#", ""), match = safeHref.match( /^(([^:\/?#]+):)?(\/\/([^\/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?/ ); return match[5]; }
[18:39:06] <ndimatteo> where should I throw that?
[18:39:40] <gnarf> it doesn't need access to anything else, so long as it is in scope of where you use it you'll be fine
[18:40:03] <gnarf> inside the outer closure is probably safe
[18:40:23] <ndimatteo> ok, how about up top by the other functions I've defined?
[18:40:39] <gnarf> makes sense
[18:42:29] <ndimatteo> ok, it's in there, now how do I replace the repetitive code?
[18:42:46] <gnarf> well you were using exp[5] in both instances
[18:43:12] <gnarf> you can just call that var path = currentPath(); then like var firstPart = path.split("/")[1];
[18:46:06] <ndimatteo> ok done.
[18:46:45] <ndimatteo> except now sub pages don't update the nav bar :/
[18:48:31] <gnarf> ndimatteo: that seemed to be what the $("a").filter() stuff should be doing right?
[18:48:38] <gnarf> ndimatteo: try adding some logs around that area
[18:48:47] <gnarf> ndimatteo: (I'd do it but I don't wanna start up my IE VM ;) )
[18:49:45] <ndimatteo> it's only on dom load :)
[18:49:57] <ndimatteo> ajax works perfectly
[18:50:34] <gnarf> ndimatteo: put the code that does that in a function, and call it from the ajax response and at dom ready?
[18:50:42] <tjmehta> When using $.ajax({contentType:'application/json', data:data, ....}) shouldn't data be converted to a json string internally..? it appears to convert the data object to a form-urlencoded string instead (the default contentType).
[18:51:30] <ndimatteo> well the thing is on ajax it's fine
[18:51:38] <ndimatteo> it's only on domload of a subpage
[18:52:12] <ndimatteo> which is weird because it's definitely grabbing the right thing, just console.logged firstPortion to make sure it was grabbing the right one
[18:54:04] <ndimatteo> do you think it's because the sub nav is separate from the main nav?
[18:54:16] <ndimatteo> it's not applying an active class to the main nav
[18:54:24] <ndimatteo> (if it's a subnav item)
[18:54:29] <ndimatteo> I feel like that's what it is
[18:56:08] <ndimatteo> does that make sense? That's why I had this up around line 440:
[18:56:12] <ndimatteo> /parse home page
[18:56:12] <ndimatteo> 					$menuHome = $menuChildren.first();
[18:56:14] <ndimatteo> 					
[18:56:15] <ndimatteo> 					//parse sub-menu root
[18:56:17] <ndimatteo> 					var path = currentPath();
[18:56:18] <ndimatteo> 					subUrl = path.split("/")[1];
[18:56:20] <ndimatteo> 					
[18:56:21] <ndimatteo> 					
[18:56:23] <ndimatteo> 					
[18:56:24] <ndimatteo> 					//parse sub-menu piece
[18:56:26] <gnarf> ndimatteo: STOP! :)
[18:56:26] <ndimatteo> 					subPart = path.split("/")[2];
[18:56:27] <ndimatteo> 					
[18:56:29] <ndimatteo> 					$menuChildren = $menuChildren.has('a[href^="'+relativeUrl+'"],a[href^="/'+relativeUrl+'"],a[href^="'+url+'"],a[href^="'+subUrl+'"],a[href^="/'+subUrl+'"]');
[18:56:30] <ndimatteo> 					if ( $menuChildren.length === 1 ) {
[18:56:32] <ndimatteo> 						$menuChildren.addClass(activeClass);
[18:56:33] <ndimatteo> 					} else { //account for home page link
[18:56:41] <gnarf> send me a privmsg when you get caught up
[18:56:47] <gnarf> sorry to mute you

[18:56:51] <bot-t> ndimatteo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:56:56] <gnarf> or a gist
[18:57:24] <gnarf> ndimatteo: remember that filter i wrote?
[18:57:32] <gnarf> ndimatteo: you probably want to apply the same idea there
[18:57:53] <gnarf> lets see if you've stopped pasting...
[18:58:00] * gnarf cheers
[19:00:02] <ndimatteo> i can talk nao?
[19:00:59] <ndimatteo> woo! sorry I hurt the internet.
[19:01:23] <Bankzilla> you spammed the channel
[19:04:51] <ndimatteo> gnarf: so the filter function you wrote adds active to the parent, but it needs to add it to the main nav link with the same href attribute's parent as well
[19:04:56] <ndimatteo> any ideas?
[19:06:43] <gnarf> ndimatteo: need to write a better filter that checks for all those cases you wrote out
[19:06:50] <gnarf> remember "this.href" is available
[19:06:55] <gnarf> inside the filter function
[19:06:57] <ndimatteo> true
[19:07:01] <gnarf> it will likely include the ENTIRE url though
[19:10:47] <ndimatteo> shit. more i.e. bugs now
[19:10:57] <ndimatteo> still adding the hash after
[19:13:14] <ndimatteo> only does it for subpages again
[19:13:17] <ndimatteo> fucking sub pages haha

[19:41:23] <Cluber> if i'm creating a form using jQuery to send the form with ajax, am I still requried to put the action and method attributes in the form element even though it isn't going to be using it?
[19:41:48] <ndimatteo> yes
[19:42:50] <ndimatteo> the form should still function without ajax. Also, ajax will be using the action selector to submit the form.
[19:45:30] <Cluber> ndimatteo: action selector? I am using this on the onclick button event, http://pastebin.com/dLGudjZ5
[19:50:15] <olinux> whats the difference between $(function() { ... and ... (function($) {
[20:33:01] <ndimatteo> anyone around?
[20:34:04] <ndimatteo> IE8 is throwing an invalid argument for jquery 1.7.2. I pulled an unminified version of query to pinpoint the error, which pointed to line 8988: fx.elem.style[ fx.prop ] = fx.now + fx.unit;
[20:34:52] <ndimatteo> this happens when I click a link that initiates a slideToggle with a callback function
[20:40:17] <gnarf> ndimatteo: what are the values of fx.prop / fx.now / fx.unit during the error? or does ie8 not have a "pause on error" option
[20:43:31] <ndimatteo> gnarf: let me check
[20:44:48] <gnarf> Cluber: see ?ajaxForm
[20:44:49] <bot-t> Cluber, ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[20:44:53] <gnarf> Cluber: thats really really useful
[20:45:08] <gnarf> Cluber: it can use the action= and method= of the form to submit it easily
[20:46:17] <Cluber> ah thanks gnarf
[20:47:47] <Cluber> gnarf: from what I understand it just reads what is in action and method on the form, and provides a way for you to handle the response
[20:48:07] <gnarf> Cluber: yup
[20:48:09] <Cluber> which is perfect for usability incase the user somehow cannot support ajax, it falls back to the form fields
[20:48:27] <gnarf> Cluber: its a really old plugin - but it is still SUPER useful
[20:48:54] <Cluber> gnarf: yeah I have been confused on how to go about it, to support both oldskool and ajax
[20:49:15] <ndimatteo> gnarf: I don't think I can
[20:49:32] <slide> I'm calling $('#id').click(function(){console.log('Clicked!');}); but it simply isnt being called, i know its the right ID? how can I see any of the callbacks associated with that object?
[20:49:37] <gnarf> Cluber: the trick is detecting the X-Requested-With header on the server side
[20:49:43] <gnarf> to respond differently for the ajax
[20:49:56] <gnarf> so you don't have to send as much "fluff" with the payload ;)
[20:51:07] <lorph> how do I detect if a jquery object doesn't have anything in it
[20:51:32] <lorph> when I use firefox it says the element is [ ]
[20:52:16] <tw2113> check if the object has length? console.log it?
[20:52:26] <lorph> oh ok the length is 0
[20:55:27] <clu3> is it possible to make sure a event handler 1 to always gets executed before event handler 2 ?

[21:03:28] <coldhead> clu3: if you bind them in the right order, that should cover you
[21:03:55] <coldhead> if not you can have callback1 set a flag and have callback2 poll for it before running
[21:05:35] <clu3> coldhead, thanks
[21:07:05] <ndimatteo> anyone have any ideas with jquery & ie8 error?
[21:09:01] <Cork> ndimatteo: you need to specify that question a lot more
[21:09:27] <Cork> "anyone have any ideas about cars and problems" :/
[21:10:02] <tw2113> you have IE8 installed, problem 1
[21:10:20] <tw2113> you have to have IE8 installed because other IE users aren't smart enough to get a good browser
[21:11:10] <clu3> coldhead, order of binding works as specified. http://api.jquery.com/bind/ says "If there are multiple handlers registered, they will always execute in the order in which they were bound"
[21:11:11] <Cork> tw2113: it wasn't meant to be an ie rambling, just that the question could match almost anything
[21:11:16] <clu3> thanks
[21:11:39] <tw2113> rules of life cork, bash IE any chance you get
[21:22:03] <ndimatteo> hey all sorry about that
[21:22:09] <ndimatteo> i posted the question earlier:
[21:22:27] <ndimatteo> IE8 is throwing an invalid argument for jquery 1.7.2. I pulled an unminified version of query to pinpoint the error, which pointed to line 8988: fx.elem.style[ fx.prop ] = fx.now + fx.unit;
[21:22:37] <ndimatteo> this happens when I click a link that initiates a slideToggle with a callback function
[21:22:46] <coldhead> clu3: i was just explaining how to do it when you couldn't control the order of binding
[21:22:54] <ndimatteo> for anyone still interested. I pinpointed that slideToggle() doesn't play nice with IE
[21:23:05] <ndimatteo> I changed the animation to fadeTo() and it works like a charm.
[21:24:11] <clu3> coldhead, i understand. Also i just kinda confirmed your 1st method works, coz you just said "should cover"
[21:25:49] <mappum> I am catching page-wide key events by listening for them on the body element, and returning true in my handlers, but it still scrolls the page. what can i do to prevent scrolling?
[21:29:18] <ndimatteo> can anyone check this page for me on firefox: marmaras.nickdimatteo.com
[21:29:24] <shoky> mappum: try listening on the document
[21:29:50] <mappum> with $(document) ?
[21:29:53] <shoky> yea
[21:30:19] <shoky> wait you're returning true?
[21:30:38] <mappum> I was, now i'm not
[21:30:48] <mappum> it scrolls whether i do nor not
[21:31:09] <mappum> it scrolls on document, too
[21:31:46] <shoky> didja try event.preventDefault()
[21:32:08] <mappum> yeah, and if I do that on the keydown event it prevents the up and press events from firing
[21:32:42] <shoky> you know, catching key events is not the proper way to prevent scrolling
[21:33:22] <mappum> what is the proper way then?
[21:33:28] <mappum> i mean preventing scrolling on key events
[21:33:29] <shoky> proper CSS
[21:33:56] <shoky> with proper overflow
[21:33:57] <mappum> when my app is running, people use key input, and i dont want that input to scroll tehem away from the app
[21:34:47] <shoky> pastebin your $(document) key handler
[21:35:10] <mappum> https://gist.github.com/2505802
[21:35:57] <shoky> ok and now with preventDefault and returning false
[21:36:06] <mappum> oh, return false?
[21:36:11] <shoky> yeah
[21:36:13] <mappum> i thought you return true when you handle it
[21:36:18] <gnarf> eh
[21:36:28] <gnarf> return false / vs / event.preventDefault()
[21:36:28] <mappum> i think that will solve it, let me see
[21:36:51] <gnarf> just FYI - return false ALSO does event.stopPropagation
[21:36:53] <shoky> returning false is the mozilla way i think?
[21:37:20] <gnarf> event.preventDefault() is usually all you really mean
[21:37:37] <gnarf> and sometimes all you really mean is event.stopPropagation()
[21:38:02] <shoky> in mappum's case it's event.preventDefault() ?
[21:38:13] <mappum> im doing e.preventDefault() on the keydown event, and it stops the ip and press from firing
[21:38:30] <mappum> i guess i'll try stopPropagation
[21:38:50] <mappum> nope
[21:39:03] <mappum> or should i be doing it on keyup too?
[21:39:14] <mappum> or keypress?
[21:39:16] <shoky> keydown is supposed to be enough i think
[21:39:39] <shoky> but it's probably browser-dependant anyway i'd say
[21:40:03] <mappum> on all 3 it still scrolls
[21:40:30] <kenperkins> ok I have a doozy.
[21:40:47] <mappum> what a doozy
[21:41:43] <shoky> mappum can you pastebin latest
[21:41:47] <shoky> with preventDefault
[21:42:06] <mappum> i did it with stopPropagation
[21:42:07] <mappum> https://gist.github.com/2505802
[21:42:34] <shoky> and if its outside the if block?
[21:42:52] <shoky> preventDefault, that is
[21:42:56] <mappum> I know the if block is being executed because I can see the code inside it working
[21:43:26] <mappum> I GOT IT
[21:43:34] <mappum> preventdefault, only on keypress
[21:43:39] <mappum> :D
[21:43:54] <shoky> werd, now try on other browsers
[21:44:00] <mappum> hopefully keyup is still being fired though D:
[21:45:37] <mappum> yep, it's good
[21:46:32] <mappum> up fires, too
[21:46:36] <mappum> thank you
[21:46:45] <mappum> why dont the docs say anythign about preventDefault?
[21:49:17] <shoky> ?event.preventDefault
[21:49:18] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[21:49:27] <mappum> oh.

[22:38:24] <Cork> but i don't think that should matter in this case
[22:38:47] <Cork> Rahul_: does the button callback work?
[22:39:07] <Rahul_> yes Cork it is working perfectly
[22:39:09] <Cork> (do you get the alert('in')
[22:39:14] <Rahul_> yes
[22:39:33] <Cork> and if you do alert($('[id="pop"]').length)
[22:39:37] <Rahul_> I get In out both alert
[22:39:39] <Cork> what number does it show=
[22:39:41] <Cork> *?
[22:39:52] <Rahul_> okey cork wait
[22:40:47] <Cork> (in the button callback)
[22:41:02] <Rahul_> i get 1
[22:41:04] <Rahul_> in alert
[22:41:08] <Cork> :/
[22:41:25] <Cork> and your using it in the NewButton callback?
[22:41:46] <Cork> (instead of dialog('close')
[22:42:36] <Rahul_> yes
[22:42:53] <Cork> that is => http://paste.pocoo.org/show/587909/
[22:43:44] <Rahul_> i am doing the same that you told me
[22:43:59] <Rahul_> but still the dialog is not closing
[22:44:00] <Cork> are you doing the same as in the pb?
[22:44:21] <Rahul_> yes cork the same that you did in thepb?
[22:44:43] <Cork> no clue then
[22:44:51] <Rahul_> listen cork
[22:45:49] <Cork> the only reason i can think of that the close could fail, is if you have multible id's in your page
[22:47:01] <Rahul_> Multiple id's like
[22:47:36] <Cork> the length test should have shown that if that was the case
[22:48:16] <Rahul_> Cork when i am not using the load method in dialog then it is working the close method
[22:49:06] <Cork> Rahul_: try making the Default4.aspx return an empty fragment and see if that helps
[22:49:25] <Cork> .load by it self doens't affect this
[22:49:55] <Rahul_> okey
[22:57:04] <Rahul_> cork it is working dude
[22:57:37] <Rahul_> you are right there is multiple id's that why it is not closing
[22:58:12] <ParadoxQuine> hey, i'm calling draggable('destroy') on a draggable after it's dropped, and receiving a typeerror 'can't ready property options of undefined' immediately after. could anyone suggest a reason for that? (i am assuming its looking for the draggable part of the jquery element still, but i dont know why it would)
[23:22:31] <gameboxer> I come a broken man, in need of help.  Anyone have a second?
[23:23:07] <beancurd> what did you break?
[23:23:10] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[23:23:14] <mindis|wurk> never ask to ask
[23:23:16] <coldhead> what will occur in the second?
[23:23:22] <gameboxer> Yeah, wanted to see if anyone was awake
[23:23:29] <gameboxer> Apparently you guys are lively here
[23:23:30] <coldhead> does it matter that i am covered in vegetable oil?
[23:23:34] <beancurd> mutilation...
[23:23:37] <gameboxer> coldhead:  Go for it
[23:23:37] <beancurd> potentially.
[23:23:44] <coldhead> LETS DO THIS
[23:24:10] <gameboxer> Have you ever had an issue with Date.setMinutes?
[23:24:23] <gameboxer> Date.setMinutes() I mean
[23:24:40] <gameboxer> I'm trying to narrow down a problem that I can't crack
[23:25:00] <beancurd> go.
[23:25:31] <coldhead> gameboxer: is this possibly a good excuse for you to use moment.js?
[23:25:43] <coldhead> because native JS datetime is such a bleak nightmare?
[23:26:00] <gameboxer> I have a group of select boxes which I use to let the user create a date for an event.  I then, on submission, use those fields' values to create a Date() object
[23:26:10] <gameboxer> coldhead:  Go on...
[23:28:09] * gameboxer is reading Moment.js docs
[23:29:36] <Xotix> gameboxer why don't you just use the calender?
[23:30:36] <gameboxer> Xotix:  Here's the issue, I'm building this all in Angular(built on jQ), and I just don't want to build a directive to run it
[23:31:28] <gameboxer> Xotix:  Trying to stay lean, that will definitely be on the docket as we come out of beta, but for now we just need to get to beta and start iterating
[23:31:56] <gameboxer> Plus, I think the issue is an Angular issue.  But not sure
[23:33:24] <gnarf> Real boredom: https://gist.github.com/bb4d8fbf36b0d493c698
[23:34:29] <snimavat> Can any one help me with jquery autocomplete, and keypress event gotchas in firefox, here's the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/W6Sz4/6/
[23:37:02] * gameboxer realizes mistake he spent last hour and a half one, commits seppuku
[23:37:30] <snimavat> Any one ?
[23:42:50] <mappum> snimavat: i just did stuff with key events
[23:43:13] <mappum> why do you not want it to be called certaint imes? you can just not handle it if you dont need to
[23:43:20] <mappum> just put an if in the handler
[23:43:54] <snimavat> Because when enter is pressed, we are using it as new item to be saved
[23:44:32] <snimavat> So the same text field is used as eiather autocomplete, if item exist, or use to enter new item (by pressing enter)
[23:44:43] <snimavat> can u plz fork the jsfiddle and show me how do u handled it
[23:44:50] <snimavat> mappum ?
[23:45:07] <coldhead> ircjsbot: tell gameboxer NO U
[23:45:07] <ircjsbot> coldhead, OK, I will tell gameboxer if I see them.
[23:45:13] <coldhead> thanks ircjsbot
[23:46:25] <snimavat> mappum  - here's the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/W6Sz4/6/ - may you fork it
[23:47:25] <mappum> when you say you "dont want this to be called", do you mean you don't want enter to close the autocomplete thing?
[23:48:44] <snimavat> Either keypress should not be called, or inside keypress handler, i need a way to figureout weather an item was selected from suggestion.
[23:48:55] <snimavat> Yes, i want autocomplete to close down
[23:49:57] <snimavat> Inshort - my goal is to have keypress work as saving new item, and autocomplete selct work as choosing existing item from suggestion
[23:51:52] <snimavat> mappum - do u think there's anyway ?
[23:54:03] <snimavat> mappum - are you trying it ?
[23:56:34] <mappum> snimavat: sorry, i'm a bit busy :P
[23:57:04] <snimavat> Np.. may be some one else can help..
[23:59:35] <soee> hi, how can i get selected index value ?
