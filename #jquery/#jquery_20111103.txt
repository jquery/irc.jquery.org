[00:19:35] <root9> !help
[00:20:25] <coldhead> that was baffling
[00:26:22] <iavana> hi
[00:27:02] <Hierofant> hi
[00:27:09] <seancurtis> hi
[00:27:32] <Hierofant> I'm teaching myself how to select chars in a string
[00:27:44] <Hierofant> whats everyone else doing?
[00:30:31] <iavana> does anyone could give me a script such as coverflow on itunes
[00:31:00] <iavana> i realy need please
[00:31:09] <seancurtis> is google down?
[00:33:21] <seancurtis> iavana: there's this one http://www.jcoverflip.com/demo
[00:33:26] <seancurtis> seen some CSS versions too
[00:33:28] <seancurtis> depends what you want
[00:33:32] <seancurtis> but google is your friend
[00:35:13] <iavana> yes yes google is my best friend, but on channel irc jquery is best especially comunity
[00:36:05] <root97> who am I
[00:38:07] <juha_> hitler
[00:56:44] <helpcrypto> hi all
[00:57:13] <helpcrypto> any of you know a way to cancel an ajax dataType script ?
[00:57:58] <nVee> hey guys. I want to work with multiple id's within an image map with an id. How can I use the each function on this form of selector? $("#imageMapID id").each() ?
[00:58:32] <seancurtis> umm don't iterate over IDs?
[00:58:39] <seancurtis> what are the IDs on?
[00:58:47] <nVee> the image map areas
[00:58:57] <nVee> each area has a unique id
[00:59:13] <seancurtis> $('#imageMapID').find('area')...
[00:59:34] <seancurtis> $('#imageMapID').find('area').each(...)
[00:59:58] <seancurtis> then just do $(this).attr('id') if you need it within the each()
[01:06:08] <helpcrypto> can anyone tell me why $.ajax timeout with dataType script: "In Firefox 3.0+ only, script and JSONP requests cannot be cancelled by a timeout; the script will run even if it arrives after the timeout period."
[01:07:45] <CodeZombie> jquery... I'm making ajax requests to api.myproject.com... I've authenticated via http authentication myproject.com... document.domain is set to myproject.com on the client app (myproject.com)... Shouldn't the ajax request include the cookie for myproject.com to api.myproject.com?
[01:07:59] <CodeZombie> heh, that jquery, was supposed to say "question"
[01:08:42] <CodeZombie> in my browser (without ajax) I can view both pages as authenticated, but ajax isn't authenticating with the cookie
[01:13:16] <clir-in> hi.. when i use $('#div1') it should call all element with that id right?
[01:21:48] <juha_> yes and no, id's are unique, you should use class instead
[01:21:58] <nail_> clir-in: only the first one (which should be the only one...)
[01:25:10] <clir-in> ok.. tnx. it explains why. :)
[01:25:17] <clir-in> i should use class then
[01:27:04] <clir-in> is it appropriate to use the $( '[id$="div1"]' ) in programming?
[01:27:40] <juha_> why would you do that? is the div1 dynamic?
[01:32:17] <clir-in> no. it is static
[01:32:41] <clir-in> but.. yea i should use class
[01:32:44] <clir-in> tnx
[01:33:56] <CodeZombie> okay, so jquerys $.ajax doesn't allow for subdomain calls at all with cookies... You guys are just going out of your way to annoy people now
[01:34:17] <CodeZombie> If the cookie authenticates, and the base domains are the same... wtf is the problem?
[01:35:25] <juha_> CodeZombie: have you tested jsonp?
[01:35:41] <CodeZombie> juha_: jsonp doesn't work for CRUD actions
[01:35:52] <CodeZombie> it's read only
[01:36:17] <juha_> well, you could give attributes that your backend will then perform
[01:36:20] <juha_> or something
[01:37:11] <CodeZombie> juha_: I need a RESTful interface to my api... my authentication cookie is setup for the entire domain
[01:37:19] <CodeZombie> I'm just going to have to fallback to auth_tokens
[01:49:46] <gnarf> CodeZombie: are you sure its not a restriction of XHR / see ?sop ?
[01:49:47] <bot-t> CodeZombie, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[01:50:43] <CodeZombie> gnarf: I've got Cross Origin Resource Sharing setup, my server returns that it's okay to send the cookie
[01:51:02] <CodeZombie> http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[01:51:27] <CodeZombie> I would think that jquery could respect the response headers
[01:51:52] <gnarf> CodeZombie: are you trying in 1.7?
[01:52:10] <gnarf> CodeZombie: i know we have been working on adding CORS support in 1.7
[01:52:46] <CodeZombie> looks like 1.6.4
[01:53:02] <CodeZombie> I'll try 1.7 and see
[01:53:14] <CodeZombie> would be really nice not to have to send the auth key every request
[01:53:47] <CodeZombie> hmm, 1.6.4 is what's on the side
[01:53:48] <CodeZombie> site*
[01:54:01] <CodeZombie> even when selecting development
[01:55:09] <Chetic> what's the easiest way to get jquery autocompletion? I've tried 0xFFFF different plugins for eclipse that don't work
[01:56:19] <sasori> question: how to pop this thing out just like a native jquery confirm box ? http://jsfiddle.net/zG9z8/1/
[01:56:28] <CodeZombie> gnarf: doesn't look like it's sending the cookie with 1.7pre
[01:57:10] <CodeZombie> gnarf: response headers https://gist.github.com/1336078
[02:08:10] <helpcrypto> hi again to everyone
[02:08:22] <helpcrypto> im doing my "hello world" plugin for jquery
[02:08:38] <helpcrypto> i succeded in creating a plugin which receives a callback
[02:08:43] <helpcrypto> and execute it
[02:09:02] <helpcrypto> now, ill like to have "a private" method inside the plugin
[02:09:12] <swe_ET> I. T
[02:09:15] <Zxurian_> so can anyone explain why on http://bit.ly/ujJ5aI, (login: test@user.com/test) when viewing in IE <= 8, clicking the edit links, causes the form element to be removed from the dom?
[02:09:48] <helpcrypto> more or less like: $.myPlugin("#myDiv", {'callback':callbackFn}) ---> internalfunction ---> callbackFn.call()
[02:10:04] <swe_ET> I'm trying to add a stored optgroup to a select but it doesn't seem to work.
[02:10:24] <helpcrypto> could you point me to the correct doc url?
[02:16:18] <poppiez> hi, is this legit? myImage.attr('src', 'R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==');?
[02:16:55] <Cork> its legit jquery, but not legit html
[02:18:47] <DanGer> hello guys, I have this http://dpaste.org/y7B1E/ but somehow it doesn't seem to toggle the class on IE, any ideas?
[02:18:56] <poppiez> Cork: so how would I go about doing this?
[02:19:22] <Cork> poppiez: what is it you want to do?
[02:19:45] <Cork> your trying to load a data-uri?
[02:19:56] <poppiez> yeah, a base64 encoding of an image
[02:20:46] <poppiez> Cork: myImage.attr('src', 'data:image/gif;base64,' + 'R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==');
[02:20:50] <helpcrypto> im doing my "hello world" plugin for jquery. i succeded in creating a plugin which receives a callback and execute it. now, ill like to have "a private" method inside the plugin
[02:20:57] <helpcrypto> more or less like: $.myPlugin("#myDiv", {'callback':callbackFn}) ---> internalfunction ---> callbackFn.call(). could you point me to the correct doc url?
[02:21:11] <Cork> poppiez: yapp, that should work
[02:21:36] <poppiez> Cork: ok, thx :)
[02:22:17] <Cork> helpcrypto: nothing magical about it, jst take it as a second parameter
[02:22:22] <Cork> *just
[02:22:43] <helpcrypto> hmmm, i dont understand what you mean
[02:22:57] <Cork> jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function(selector, options) {}
[02:23:08] <helpcrypto> sure
[02:23:24] <helpcrypto> and now...to exec an internal function, how i declare it and where?
[02:23:45] <Cork> a callback isn't an internal function
[02:23:56] <helpcrypto> jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function(selector, options) { // foo ...internalmethod() //bar}
[02:24:04] <helpcrypto> im not talking about callback
[02:24:06] <Cork> and as long as you don't attach a function to fn and its in the scoping, its internal
[02:24:09] <helpcrypto> callback is properly working
[02:24:44] <helpcrypto> jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function(selector, options) { function internal(){...} } should work?
[02:25:06] <Cork> (function($) { function this_function_does_not_exist() {} jQuery.fn.myplugin() })(jQuery)
[02:25:11] <Cork> opps
[02:25:21] <Cork> (function($) { function this_function_does_not_exist() {} jQuery.fn.myplugin = function() {} })(jQuery)
[02:25:33] <helpcrypto> let me test
[02:26:17] <Cork> or you could define it inside the myPlugin function
[02:26:21] <Cork> same thing
[02:26:41] <Cork> (except it becomes one function per instance instead of one for all)
[02:27:51] <helpcrypto> ok...not working
[02:27:59] <helpcrypto> let me another sec to check...
[02:28:04] <Cork> ?p @ helpcrypto
[02:28:05] <bot-t> helpcrypto, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:28:38] <clir-in> hi.. how to select the element li from list? i have this code <ul class="myclass"><li>li1</li><li>li2</li></ul>
[02:29:05] <Cork> "the element"?
[02:29:08] <Cork> you have two
[02:29:09] <clir-in> yes
[02:29:15] <Cork> you mean all?
[02:29:18] <clir-in> yes
[02:29:21] <clir-in> i mean all
[02:29:28] <Cork> $('.myclass li')
[02:29:50] <clir-in> should i not call the ul first?
[02:30:09] <Cork> if you have the class on other elements yes
[02:30:15] <Cork> else its not needed
[02:30:32] <clir-in> how should i do that?
[02:30:33] <helpcrypto> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/at2XH/  ?
[02:30:42] <clir-in> ul .myclass li ?
[02:30:49] <Cork> ul.myclass
[02:30:52] <Cork> no space
[02:31:07] <Cork> space mean a new element in css selectors
[02:31:13] <clir-in> oh ok
[02:31:15] <clir-in> tnx cork
[02:31:20] <Cork> or rather a new level
[02:32:01] <Zxurian_> can anyone reset a password on a jqueryui bugs account?
[02:32:18] <Cork> helpcrypto: url is undefined
[02:33:14] <Cork> Zxurian_: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/reset_password
[02:33:31] <HardPhuck> http://www.unidrain.dk/sv/konsument/ is there a way I could reproduce the small, clickable circles, with jquery?
[02:33:50] <Zxurian_> cork: filled it out twice, still awaiting email as of 15 minutes ago
[02:33:55] <helpcrypto> Cork: solved, but still doesnt work
[02:34:36] <Cork> Zxurian_: bivs and border-radius or svg
[02:34:42] <Cork> i would prob go with svg my self
[02:35:10] <DanGer> anyone can tell me why this is not working in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/MyVmU/
[02:35:26] <Zxurian_> cork: come again?
[02:37:43] <helpcrypto> Cork: ?
[02:37:44] <Zxurian_> cork: not sure if that was a miss type, but does bivs / svg have anything to do with awaiting a password reset for jquery ui bugs?
[02:38:31] <Cork> helpcrypto: http://jsfiddle.net/at2XH/7/
[02:39:46] <helpcrypto> Cork: THX!!! going to check was i miss
[02:39:59] <Cork> number of parameters basically
[02:40:07] <swe_ET> Never mind got it to work with .detach()
[02:40:09] <Cork> you gave the object to selector not to settings
[02:53:01] <DanGer> http://jsfiddle.net/MyVmU/1/ - doesn't work on IE, anyone?
[02:53:52] <helpcrypto> Cork: ok...i now realized what happend
[02:54:08] <helpcrypto> my problem was i was sending url instead of config.url
[02:54:12] <helpcrypto> DAMN IT
[02:54:32] <helpcrypto> anyway...if i now want a settimeout, can i use config.timeout ?
[02:55:58] <HardPhuck> anyone knows how i would create and animate 20px circle (which would become 25px circle and back to 20px, kind of pulsating effect) with jquery?
[02:56:54] <HardPhuck> and needs to work in IE7+ :)
[02:57:03] <Cork> then your out of luck
[02:57:17] <helpcrypto> Â¿?
[02:57:27] <helpcrypto> http://jsfiddle.net/at2XH/11/
[02:57:48] <Cork> ie doesn't provice a compatible way to create rounded elements
[02:57:54] <Cork> *provide
[02:58:21] <Cork> you would have to create vml elements and animte them for ie
[02:58:38] <HardPhuck> I can do that as long as it works
[02:58:47] <Cork> on the other hand...
[02:59:20] <Cork> you could try using rapahel
[02:59:28] <Cork> ?g javascript parahel
[02:59:29] <bot-t> Cork, cirugiayendoscopia's Channel - YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/user/cirugiayendoscopia
[02:59:30] <Cork> bah..
[02:59:39] <Cork> ?g javascript rapahel
[02:59:40] <bot-t> Cork, Raphaël—JavaScript Library - http://raphaeljs.com/
[03:02:25] <HardPhuck> Cork: thanx I'll have a look
[03:05:49] <helpcrypto> Cork: are the parameters/arges the problem? should i crate a function to wrap the call?
[03:05:59] <helpcrypto> http://jsfiddle.net/at2XH/13/
[03:08:16] <helpcrypto> seems to be that...now looks like working
[03:08:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/at2XH/15/
[03:08:33] <Cork> helpcrypto: never, ever EVER use strings in setTimeout
[03:08:44] <helpcrypto> lesson learned XD
[03:08:53] <helpcrypto> btw
[03:08:55] <Cork> and you misspelled a lot of variables
[03:09:31] <Cork> oh wait, i did ;P
[03:09:31] <helpcrypto> do you know if it is possible to abort a jquery script ajax request?
[03:09:40] <Cork> you just missed to add config. infront of url
[03:09:46] <Cork> sure
[03:10:04] <Cork> just catch its xhr object and call .abort() on iy
[03:10:06] <Cork> *it
[03:11:39] <helpcrypto> dosnt work
[03:12:15] <helpcrypto> afaik ajax requests using dataType script doesnt raise an error or an exception
[03:12:33] <helpcrypto> what im trying its the following:
[03:12:44] <Cork> type script isn't really an ajax call
[03:12:47] <helpcrypto> open a conection to a https using ajax+script
[03:12:53] <Cork> it just adds a script tag to the header
[03:13:06] <helpcrypto> if succeed->ssl cert already imported on trusted cas
[03:13:13] <Cork> but yes it races connection errors
[03:13:21] <helpcrypto> if timeout-> ca its probablyt not on the ca db
[03:13:52] <helpcrypto> theres no exception, error or anything when the cert is not installed and the connection is aborted (by firefox)
[03:14:02] <helpcrypto> do you want the code?
[03:14:32] <Cork> helpcrypto: i know they throw exceptions i use them my self
[03:14:39] <Cork> so its something with your code if it doesn't
[03:15:04] <necolas> is there a way to use the 'change' event without it being deferred until focus is lost?
[03:15:30] <helpcrypto> Cork...do u use ff?
[03:15:39] <Cork> yes
[03:15:45] <Cork> necolas: you would have to fake it a bit
[03:16:40] <necolas> Cork: ok. there appears to be a native event - input - that does that in modern browsers
[03:17:11] <helpcrypto> Cork: please DONT ALLOW this exception: enter https://www.agenciatributaria.gob.es and tell me if you have ssl warning or the cert its already on your trusted certs db
[03:17:27] <Cork> necolas: $('input').change(function() {}).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $(this).change(); }, 0); });
[03:17:28] <helpcrypto> (safe website from the tax ministry of spain)
[03:17:41] <Cork> bah type again...
[03:17:47] <Cork> necolas: $('input').change(function() {}).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.change(); }, 0); });
[03:18:11] <necolas> Cork: thanks. i'll give that a spin
[03:19:01] <NoNoNo> Cork: what's this for? .change(function() {}).
[03:19:36] <aaronmcadam> ?change @ NoNoNo
[03:19:37] <bot-t> NoNoNo, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[03:20:01] <aaronmcadam> what's the point in that Cork
[03:20:19] <Cork> you bind the change event and trigger it on keypress
[03:20:33] <aaronmcadam> yea yea but the change event will fire anyway if u type something in
[03:20:35] <Cork> for example pasting from the mouse doesn't trigger keypresses
[03:20:39] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[03:20:43] <Cork> aaronmcadam: not always
[03:20:46] <NoNoNo> so it's not literaly .change(function() {}). but .change(function() { .... fill here ... }).
[03:20:56] <Cork> input was a bad example, but select elements trigger on .blur
[03:21:03] <aaronmcadam> haha NoNoNo you need somethin in ur callback
[03:21:15] <calvinmcgee> I have som prob styling this jQuery UI slider, http://wp.wallmanderco.se/andrens/. I have made the slider smaller than the background image to make the handle fit, but that results in that the end points ain't clickable.
[03:21:55] <aaronmcadam> that code looks like it could be done better tho
[03:22:28] <Cork> go heady find a way that will catch all situations
[03:22:35] <Cork> *ahead
[03:23:43] <helpcrypto> Cork: please DONT ALLOW this exception: enter https://www.agenciatributaria.gob.es and tell me if you have ssl warning or the cert its already on your trusted certs db ?
[03:24:28] <Cork> helpcrypto: sorry i don't have the time to disect your webpage
[03:24:30] <Xotix> hi
[03:24:41] <apollo13> helpcrypto: don't think you are a bit offtopic here?
[03:25:03] <apollo13> for what it's worth that cert is surely in no cert dbâ€¦
[03:26:43] <helpcrypto> Cork: apollo13 that not my webpage, and thats a very jquery related issue
[03:27:06] <helpcrypto> Cork: thx a lot for your help
[03:27:46] <helpcrypto> the problem im having here seems to be that jquery is not filling response headers properly when using datatype script on ajax
[03:28:14] <helpcrypto> and ill like to know if its a know limitation, a bug...there is any tricky way of solving it...
[03:29:02] <helpcrypto> if the used cert for the webpage https is not on the cert db, should ajax return with an error or throw an exception?
[03:29:23] <apollo13> if the cert is not in the cert db I won't even get as far as issuing a ajax request :Ã¾
[03:29:32] <helpcrypto> in fact, using firebug when the cert is trusted, i get a 200 response, but headers seem to be unset
[03:29:49] <apollo13> unset by jquery or already before? and which header?
[03:30:04] <helpcrypto> and when the cert is not trusted, i expect an error or something
[03:30:35] <apollo13> out of curiosity, if the certificate isn't trusted how will you be on that page to issue an ajax request in the first place?
[03:30:59] <helpcrypto> im not on that page
[03:31:38] <apollo13> so what do you use to circumvent the same origin policy, probably something there doesn't like you ;)
[03:31:53] <helpcrypto> from http://foo.com i want to access https://bar.foo.com but, displaying a warning if the user dont have thge needed/trusted cert
[03:32:24] <helpcrypto> if the cert is trusted, the ajax succeed method is xecuted :)
[03:32:34] <helpcrypto> if the cert is NOT trusted, nothing happens
[03:32:51] <helpcrypto> (i expect an error, exception...something)
[03:33:04] <Xotix> On jquery ui draggable. If i start dragging something. How do i get the dragged element? How can i manipulate it? So when i drop it, it is different.
[03:33:21] <helpcrypto> firefox shows a 200 response code for the trusted cert and "empty+aborted" for the nont-trusted case
[03:33:35] <ravenzz> helpcrypto what error cames from the xhr request?
[03:33:36] <apollo13> sounds plausible
[03:33:51] <ravenzz> do you have a demo?
[03:34:07] <helpcrypto> doesnt work on me.... ravenzz without trusted cert, never "returns"
[03:34:13] <helpcrypto> sure...let me paste the code
[03:34:24] <apollo13> helpcrypto: which callback handlers did you attach? did you try complete?
[03:34:43] <apollo13> although error should get aborted too
[03:34:51] <ravenzz>  anyway
[03:34:53] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ helpcrypto

[03:34:56] <helpcrypto> let me paste and comment :P
[03:35:22] <ravenzz> helpcrypto it could be better if you could provide a working one

[03:35:34] <ravenzz> I mean not just a paste
[03:36:24] <DarsVaeda> hi, I fetch an xml via $.get() with jquery, I want to offer the return as download, can I do that with jquery and if so, how?
[03:36:26] <ravenzz> sooner or later I would take an english course, i promise
[03:36:54] <ravenzz> is it an url?
[03:38:24] <helpcrypto> Cork: ravenzz apollo13  here it goes: http://jsfiddle.net/at2XH/19/
[03:38:34] <helpcrypto> i can comment, answer or whatever you need
[03:38:59] <helpcrypto> using firefox and whatching firebug headers you will notice the ajax request is not returning
[03:39:13] <helpcrypto> (and i have set a timeout to consider it failed)
[03:40:16] <Xotix> When having e.G.  draggable with sortable. So you drag something and drop it somewhere. How can i manipulate what get's dropped?
[03:40:47] <helpcrypto> Xotix: can you know it since you start draggin?
[03:41:05] <helpcrypto> start drag->get name->drop (name)
[03:41:10] <apollo13> helpcrypto: I get "ajax" first and then "no" what do you get?
[03:41:19] <Xotix> helpcrypto: what?
[03:41:23] <helpcrypto> apollo: same
[03:41:34] <cook1es> Anyone have a clue why I can't select a class element with .<class> when I can select body and I can select both in firebug console?
[03:41:51] <helpcrypto> apollo: as you dont have trusted ca cert for the ssl conection, should that raise an exception or error on ajax call?
[03:42:02] <helpcrypto> (you can ignore the "no" alert
[03:42:23] <helpcrypto> Xotix: you want to know which object yopu dropped, right?
[03:42:52] <Xotix> i want to manipulate the element im dragging. e.G. wrap into a div and when droped, the div should still be there.
[03:43:33] <helpcrypto> Xotix: afaik, you can start dragin on an element...and get the object dom "id", right?
[03:43:49] <helpcrypto> when you drop...you still have the id, isnt it?
[03:44:33] <helpcrypto> ravenzz: any clue?
[03:44:47] <Xotix> Isn't there something like a temporarily copy in an objet of my dragged element i just can manipulate?
[03:44:55] <superos> Hi, I got some reports that when some of (all?) my user are using their back button and particular script does not run as intended. Could that be true and how do make sure the script runs again when user use the back button?
[03:45:01] <Xotix> or another question
[03:45:39] <helpcrypto> Xotix: afaik when you drag an object...you drag it. not a copy of it.
[03:46:08] <helpcrypto> you can clone it on the start drag event
[03:46:11] <DarsVaeda> hi, can I offer something as download via jquery?
[03:46:11] <apollo13> helpcrypto: looks somewhat buggy, I just got an error in the console like "CERT_PROMPT_ABORTED_BY_USER"
[03:46:21] <clir-in> hi! i am wondering why the elements(supposed to be dragable in main page) iveloaded from other page is not working. ?
[03:46:24] <Xotix> atm im understanding it liek that
[03:46:42] <clir-in> like i have my main page. and item_list page
[03:47:05] <clir-in> i used $('#div1').load("item_list.html")
[03:47:08] <apollo13> helpcrypto: if I remove dataType script my error handler is called *gg*
[03:47:39] <apollo13> might be time to look into the jquery source code ;)
[03:47:40] <helpcrypto> apollo13: buggy?....whats buggy?. when you try to enter a ssl secured page, firefox shows a warning message, but the request still should "answer", right?
[03:47:45] <clir-in> after its loaded the dragging is not working
[03:48:09] <clir-in> but if i put the item list directly in my main page. its working...
[03:48:15] <helpcrypto> apollo13: if you remove the datatype...the xhr object its always "empty
[03:48:19] <helpcrypto> in other words
[03:48:28] <helpcrypto> a normal (not script) datatype request
[03:48:44] <helpcrypto> is "the same" when there is or there is not a trusted cert
[03:48:48] <Xotix> helper is the visible thing you see while dragging. then you hovering over the sortable. a placeholder gets created. Then, it puts event.target in there. If it is a copy or a link, i don't know. I wasnt able to manipulate it. Seems like a copy.
[03:48:55] <helpcrypto> so, theres no way to know if its installed or not
[03:49:14] <Xotix> Can i somehow defined the placeholder which is used? i know i can specify it's class, but i want to defined what HTML is used for it.
[03:49:18] <apollo13> helpcrypto: jhr.isRejected() tells me firefox rejected the request
[03:49:53] <helpcrypto> jhr = $.ajax... or its an epsecial object?
[03:50:39] <apollo13> the first element of the ajax.error callback
[03:50:49] <apollo13> jqXHR
[03:50:51] <helpcrypto> let me check...
[03:51:05] <apollo13> if datatype != script
[03:51:12] <apollo13> no idea what happens for script
[03:51:29] <helpcrypto> hold a sec
[03:52:16] <helpcrypto> apollo13: could you modify the jsfiddle?
[03:53:04] <apollo13> http://jsfiddle.net/wvS5k/3/
[03:53:41] <james13433> I have a number like 10, but I need to make it 10.00 so it looks like currency, whats the best wya?
[03:54:59] <apollo13> helpcrypto: but that request is doomed to fail anyways due to the same origin policy, isn't it?
[03:55:16] <helpcrypto> apollo13...depending on the fail
[03:55:36] <helpcrypto> remember what im looking for: guess if user has trusted the cert already
[03:55:49] <helpcrypto> trying to merge your code...give me a sec
[03:55:53] <helpcrypto> (and thx a lot)
[03:56:22] <apollo13> even if a user accepted it the jsfiddle should fail
[03:56:45] <apollo13> which makes me wonder how useful it is to use jsfiddle for testing^^
[03:58:00] <helpcrypto> apollo13: in fact....jsfiddle its failing, but my code locally isnt
[03:58:29] <helpcrypto> my code is returning sucess, but the object was empty, as far as i remmebr
[03:58:33] <helpcrypto> going to check again
[04:02:01] <helpcrypto> apollo13: ok...when running locally, the success is raised, the jqXHR its an XMLHttpRequest, but when adding .isRejected() js stops working
[04:02:55] <helpcrypto> cant i do the following: success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {alert("S "+jqXHR.isRejected()); } ?
[04:07:44] <helpcrypto> apollo13: ?
[04:08:01] <apollo13> no idea, I still think every request should fail no matter what
[04:09:10] <helpcrypto> apollo13: i agree. it should fail, considering same origin policy
[04:09:34] <helpcrypto> but the error should be raised, not (as in my case) the succeed function :P
[04:09:42] <apollo13> something like that
[04:10:14] <apollo13> actually the browser should make the request, ignoring sop to check for the x-allow-* headers
[04:10:19] <apollo13> but then it should fail
[04:10:57] <helpcrypto> well...its not.
[04:11:02] <Xotix> helpcrypto: i meant that: http://tinyw.in/pA32 maybe you are intrested in knowing that too.
[04:11:15] <helpcrypto> i have listed all the properties for the jqhxr object to compare between calls
[04:11:19] <apollo13> Access-Control-Allow-Origin it was -- either way that's way over my head :)
[04:11:44] <helpcrypto> Xotix: thx. ill look later on it
[04:12:44] <helpcrypto> apollo13: the jqXHR object doesnt have a isRejected property on succeed
[04:12:53] <helpcrypto> Â¿?
[04:13:24] <apollo13> helpcrypto: probably, wouldn't make sense after all, would it?
[04:13:48] <helpcrypto> i still dont understand what is happening
[04:14:09] <helpcrypto> lets back to the target: know when the cert is present or not
[04:14:40] <apollo13> I have no idea sry ;)
[04:23:15] <helpcrypto> after adding the cert to the trusted certs
[04:23:28] <helpcrypto> the jqXHR object properties have the same value
[04:23:57] <helpcrypto> so, no difference visible, altough it returned (visible on firebug) a 200 document header, instead of aborted one
[04:24:00] <helpcrypto> :S
[04:28:34] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[04:34:16] <helpcrypto> ill continue my battle against the gods: i want to know if the user has a trusted "myca" installed on the browser, before redirecting hinm to a https page that use it
[04:35:30] <helpcrypto> as ajax error handler says: "Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests. This is an Ajax Event. ", how could i do it?
[04:38:31] <Layke> I was on a website yesterday, but I forgot to bookmark. I want to create something where I can have two "Left" and "Right" button/panels that scroll as I scroll through an element.
[04:38:44] <Layke> Is there anything native that will help me?
[04:44:25] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[04:45:21] <Shwaiil> Q: If I'm loading html to the dom, while having all scripts already loaded on header. How can I have a script executed when placing the html in dom ? Placing <script> on that HTML with an anonymous function  is not making it work. Any tips ? tks for looking
[04:45:31] <wgo> I've been trying for a couple of days to achieve a flip+grow effect but I can't seem to nail it. Does anyone know of anything similar already implemented.
[04:46:08] <wgo> I'm struggling to get my two stretches of the element to run synchronously
[04:47:59] <Antaranian> Shwaiil: are you using jQuery $.getScript method for that ?
[04:48:29] <Antaranian> oh, or the script you need to execute is already loaded ?
[04:48:45] <Shwaiil> Antaranian, tks for looking.
[04:48:49] <Shwaiil> It's already loaded
[04:49:20] <Antaranian> can you show your code ?
[04:50:33] <Shwaiil> this is the html that's going to be loaded to the body
[04:50:34] <Shwaiil> http://pastie.org/2803961
[04:51:07] <Shwaiil> and this is the script loaded on header http://pastie.org/2803963
[04:52:21] <Antaranian> actually it isn't the best practice to combine js and html
[04:52:25] <Shwaiil> if I call it trough the console will work
[04:52:37] <Shwaiil> Antaranian, yeah I know that..but for this case I didnt remember anything else
[04:52:50] <Shwaiil> can I use live or delegate for onload of this element ?! or something ?!
[04:53:37] <Antaranian> how are you getting it? $.ajax or something like that ?
[04:53:45] <Shwaiil> Antaranian, yeah
[04:54:20] <Antaranian> there is a callback function for loading complete event
[04:54:51] <Shwaiil> Antaranian, can u show an example of it ? I would appreciate it :)
[04:58:07] <Antaranian> Shwaiil: something like this http://pastie.org/2803994
[05:00:25] <helpcrypto> ill continue my battle against the gods: i want to know if the user has a trusted "myca" installed on the browser, before redirecting hinm to a https page that use it
[05:01:00] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[05:01:10] <Double_Rainbow> there is an easter egg on this website: http://www.lematinal.com/
[05:01:21] <Double_Rainbow> but i cannot a .show() with it
[05:01:36] <Double_Rainbow> it says element not found
[05:02:13] <Shwaiil> Antaranian, tks ;) I'm taking a look
[05:02:49] <Shwaiil> Oh yeah, I could do that, but I have a general class for this ajax call
[05:04:16] <Double_Rainbow> anyone?
[05:04:46] <Antaranian> Double_Rainbow: can you show your code ?
[05:05:14] <Antaranian> Õ·Õ¡Õ¿ Õ¿Õ¡ÖƒÕ¡Õ¯ Õ¡Õ¦Õ£ Õ¡ Õ§Õ¬Õ«
[05:05:21] <Antaranian> sorry
[05:06:10] <nail_> Double_Rainbow: jQuery('#akashsecret').show() that works, what are you calling show() on ?
[05:06:17] <nail_> $ is not mapped to jQuery on this page
[05:06:33] <Double_Rainbow> http://pastebin.com/d0VwrhkS
[05:06:48] <Double_Rainbow> nail_: what do you mean not mapped?
[05:07:24] <nail_> $ is not jQuery
[05:07:43] <AdvoWork> how come, if im doing: new_event_: $('#un').val()  it basically shows as "On" no matter if ticked or not ticked?
[05:08:05] <Double_Rainbow> nail_: oh yeah, jQuery('#akashsecret').show() worked ;)
[05:08:19] <Double_Rainbow> but i still do not know how to activate it
[05:11:27] <seutje> AdvoWork: coz that's its value, try using .is(':checked') or something similar
[05:11:57] <Famic> Double_Rainbow: stop trying to cheat :p
[05:19:38] <marekw2143> how to get all elements with style "color" set to red?
[05:21:23] <xec> $("*").css("color", "red"); ? :D
[05:22:06] <workmad3> marekw2143: you want to do a css selector based off css attributes?
[05:22:19] <marekw2143> workmad3: yeah
[05:23:00] <workmad3> marekw2143: pretty sure you can't... css lets your select based off html attributes, not css stylesheets applied to the elements
[05:23:35] <marekw2143> workmad3: I'm considering using .filter(function(idx){ if $(this).css('color') === 'red' { ....
[05:23:41] <HardPhuc> can i target the .mydiv:before with jquery?
[05:23:58] <workmad3> marekw2143: if you filtered all elements, that might do it
[05:24:13] <workmad3> marekw2143: but that isn't a CSS selector ;)
[05:28:43] <clir-in> hi! i am wondering why the elements(supposed to be dragable in main page) iveloaded from other page is not working. ?
[05:28:43] <clir-in> like i have my main page. and item_list page
[05:28:43] <clir-in> i used $('#div1').load("item_list.html")
[05:28:43] <clir-in> after loading the dragging is not working
[05:29:40] <Antaranian> clir-in: you need to initialize that elements as draggables after loading
[05:32:57] <theylmz> #j php
[05:34:30] <marekw2143> is it possible to make event for changing div value?
[05:34:32] <clir-in> Antaranian: how?
[05:35:05] <Antaranian> clir-in: how are you initializing it for the main elements on the page ?
[05:35:34] <clir-in> i have this code
[05:35:43] <clir-in> 		$("ul.itemslist li").draggable({
[05:35:43] <clir-in>             revert: true
[05:35:43] <clir-in>         });
[05:35:43] <clir-in> 		
[05:35:54] <clir-in> ??
[05:36:09] <clir-in> Antaranian: im not sure
[05:36:27] <clir-in> sorry.. im new to this
[05:37:54] <obfuscatr> is there any problem removing the object which has triggered the code where the remove runs?
[05:39:07] <Antaranian> clir-in: ok, then use callback function on load to make li-s in the #div1 draggable, as you had done it for #ul.itemslist
[05:39:36] <Antaranian> marekw2143: google for javascript watch method implementation for DOM with jQuery
[05:41:30] <Antaranian> obfuscatr: like removing link that triggers removal function when clicked ? No, it's ok
[05:44:04] <Shwaiil> Q: Is this valid ? $("body").delegate("#someID", "ready", function(){});
[05:44:26] <Shwaiil> Let's say the element is not present in the DOM and I want to execute a script when its ready
[05:47:28] <brothertuck> hi, got a little question: this works fine on IE: $('[name="pictag['+c+'][id]"')[0].val;  but not working on webkit based browser... it not find the element
[05:48:04] <jubby> Shwaiil, what is instantiating the element #someID?
[05:49:44] <jubby> Assuming you're creating the element some time after onReady?
[05:50:21] <Shwaiil> jubby I've placed the element trough ajax. I've got a general method for that, that I place in elements by placing its class name
[05:50:50] <Shwaiil> instantiating the element #someId, I guess I didnt understood the question
[05:52:10] <clir-in> thank you Antaranian
[05:52:24] <jubby> To summarize, you have an existing function that you would like to execute once the element is created?
[05:52:44] <Shwaiil> yeh :)
[05:53:09] <Antaranian> clir-in: :)
[05:53:13] <Shwaiil> and I dont want to call it trough .ajax success
[05:53:22] <clir-in> another question. in my droppable div.
[05:53:24] <jubby> You should be able to do that with a callback once the ajax load is complete
[05:53:37] <clir-in> example i draged items there. then i will be cloned there.
[05:53:41] <Shwaiil> jubby cant I do it diferently without the callback ?
[05:53:48] <jorenl_> Hey all, what's the best way to bind events to elements added to the DOM by .html() ? Can I do it right afterwards, or is the DOM-adding asynchronous?
[05:54:16] <jubby> To me, the callback would make the most sense. Is there a reason that wouldn't work for you?
[05:54:34] <clir-in> the cloned ones should be removed if drag outside the container
[05:54:39] <clir-in> how will i do that?
[05:56:09] <Myx0x3> is it possible to scroll down a bit on a site without achors? with jquery?
[05:56:56] <lucasw> Hi, looking for a simple plugin which imitates the old html tag <marquee>
[05:57:13] <luite_> Myx0x3: you can modify the scrollHeight of an element
[05:57:26] <jubby> Shwaiil assuming your using the jquery ajax method: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#callback-functions
[05:57:37] <jorenl_> lucasw: http://remysharp.com/demo/marquee.html ?
[05:57:51] <webguynow> Uggh My work is still supporting IE6 IE7 and I think I have to use this style:
[05:57:54] <webguynow> $(document).ready()
[05:58:05] <webguynow> even then  it seemed like I was getting errors
[05:58:22] <Myx0x3> luite_: how? :)
[05:58:37] <webguynow> I was using IETester  ( for previous versions ) as a simulator,
[05:58:44] <webguynow> also played with FireBug Lite
[05:58:49] <Shwaiil> jubby, thanks. I was thinking in something like delegate, live or bind, when the element was ready, but I see that this is the best practice.
[05:59:04] <webguynow> any comments on using jQuery with older IE versions  ?
[05:59:29] <luite_> Myx0x3: it's a DOM attribute, I think you need to change it for body to scroll the whole page
[06:00:00] <jorenl_> webguynow: psst, punctuation marks work too :) returns are quite annoying in IRC.
[06:00:07] <Myx0x3> luite_: *sigh* well ill see what i do..
[06:00:20] <jubby> Shwaiil, anytime.  :D
[06:00:50] <luite_> Myx0x3: but it's a pixel value, if you need to scroll some specific element into view, you probably need to do a bit more querying to find the element's position relative to the element that you're scrolling
[06:01:11] <jorenl_> webguynow: I have no experience with jQuery in older browsers, but the homepage claims it should be IE6.0+ compatible.
[06:02:36] <jorenl_> webguynow: what errors are you getting with what code?
[06:04:42] <webguynow> I believe at work, we're stuck on jQuery 1.3
[06:05:20] <webguynow> I'm getting a lot of   function not found, and Object expected, from the get go
[06:05:20] <obfuscatr> if array.a = [1,2,3] gives me: {a:[1,2,3]}, how can I append refer to array.a given a variable id that contains "a". I want something like array.($id)
[06:05:30] <obfuscatr> -append
[06:07:45] <Morkel> How can i acces from a ajax callback the dom object so that i can write in an dom html object?
[06:10:15] <jorenl_> Morkel: Just use a selector? callback(data) { $('#element').html('dataFromAjaxCall') } ? or am I misunderstanding your question?
[06:11:09] <Morkel> jorenl_: https://gist.github.com/1336432 Yes but the div dont change
[06:11:59] <jubby> Morkel: do you need to write an object inside an existing object? You would start with the selector for the DOM object as joren_l stated. Then use something like the append method: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[06:14:06] <Morkel> jubby: i will fill the div with the data from the ajax request. But append dont work to
[06:14:51] <jubby> Morkel are you throwing any javascript errors?
[06:15:00] <Morkel> jubby: no
[06:15:35] <Morkel> i think the problem is the callback. it dont find the right div
[06:16:04] <jorenl_> Morkel: is there a script executed? If you have a div with id="results" it should work.
[06:16:31] <Morkel> jorenl_: i have this div but it dont work.
[06:16:44] <jorenl_> Morkel: it doesn't really seem like dataType: 'script' is relevant in this context. What are you trying to do?
[06:17:50] <Morkel> jorenl_: the data comes from the server to the browser. I can see this in the server log and firebug net panel. I will fill a fancy box with ajax content when i click on the link
[06:18:47] <jorenl_> Morkel: why are you using dataType: 'script' then? Try doing $.get('url', callback (data) {...})
[06:20:22] <fr4nk> hi there
[06:21:41] <fr4nk> i slide down an input, which has a value and give focus on it, after that i check if focus is given i remove the default value, works fine in FF but not in IE8 :-|
[06:21:57] <fr4nk> any suggestions?
[06:22:22] <fr4nk> any IE not only 8
[06:22:26] <fr4nk> >.<
[06:22:53] <jubby> fr4nk: solution = #occupymicrosoft
[06:22:53] <Xotix> hi
[06:23:00] <fr4nk> :D
[06:27:43] <Xotix> http://tinyw.in/XK60 if you drag an element from the left to the right, the control elements (red X) are wrong created. there will be 4. this is, because im getting tthe  children and then add theses X in a loop. The 3 beginning element's aren't deleted when the function get's called which creates there X elements. How can i solve this? Look at the script on line 3 functions removePlaceholder() and updateControlElements()
[06:29:26] <obfuscatr> if i have a="person", b="jim", c="cats", is there a single line like array[a] = {b: c} to achieve an array like {person: {jim: cats}}
[06:30:01] <TeslaFuture> I need to find a an element out of a list which has its background set, whats the best way to do think?
[06:30:03] <TeslaFuture> this*
[06:31:21] <osmosis_paul> Good evening
[06:31:51] <osmosis_paul> i was trying to remember how can i get the value of one list if i have that list inside another list???
[06:32:19] <osmosis_paul> well just for resume how can i get the value of the selected value of one list?
[06:32:22] <Aquaguy> Hey there!
[06:32:24] <osmosis_paul> one select i mean
[06:33:26] <Aquaguy> I have a div element containing a span, both have .click events, is there any way to cancel the click event of the div when you click the span?
[06:37:10] <Aquaguy> anyone?
[06:37:29] <jubby> Hey Aquaguy!!! LULZ!
[06:37:47] <GoSox> i'm trying to do a slideDown() but only if the element is not already visible. this is the code I have but it doesn't seem to work. It always does the slideDown(), even if the #holdbox is not hidden. http://pastebin.com/NyBV8gDd
[06:38:34] <ravenzz> ?unbind @ Aquaguy
[06:38:35] <bot-t> Aquaguy, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[06:39:20] <Aquaguy> ravenzz, I dont want to unbind the click event, but i don't want it to work when you click its children
[06:39:30] <phlp> ?event.stopPropagation @Aquaguy
[06:39:31] <bot-t> Aquaguy, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[06:39:49] <Aquaguy> phlp, thank you!
[06:39:55] <Aquaguy> ravenzz, thank you too.
[06:40:48] <ravenzz> oh sorry Aquaguy, I misunderstood you
[06:45:58] <nVee> hey, how can I capture the coodinates of the location of my last click
[06:46:52] <Cork> nVee: only way is to bind a click handler on the document or body and storing its cordiants in a global variable
[06:48:01] <pentarex> hey guys how I can make my text fields look like this in twitter http://twitter.com/
[06:48:26] <pentarex> I mean when I click username it is glowing and the username its also there untill i enter some text
[06:48:33] <nVee> Cork: So $("body").click(function() { how do I get the coordinates? });
[06:51:09] <xec> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/07/identifying-locating-mouse-position-in.html
[06:59:20] <Xotix> If i have 2 functions. one does something like $("x").remove() (remove everything in there) and on does like $("x").children.each(//add something for each child); how  can i make sure that the second function just get's called, when the dom manipulation the first started, has finished?
[07:01:56] <kborchers> Xotix: i'm not sure i totally understand you but if you do $("x").remove();, that will remove x and its children from the dom meaning $("x").children().... will not work since x nolonger exists
[07:02:59] <Xotix> sry i mean of course something like #controls > div ;)
[07:04:46] <Xotix> kborchers: if you go to http://tinyw.in/XK60 you see 3 blue placeholders. if you drag something, they get deleted. now the controls (red X) should be updated. They first get deleted at all and then i count, how much children are there and create an X for each. So after droping, it should be one X and not 4, thats because it still thinks, the 3 placeholders are there. Why? Look at line 3 in the code.
[07:05:32] <scar2> I copied the code directly from the index.html file generated by themeroller (mine is at airdorableballoons.com/jquery) for the Highlight feature, and it doesn't show up properly. Any idea why?
[07:07:50] <Xotix> i think i got it
[07:14:03] <phlp> Xotix did you figure it out?
[07:14:21] <Xotix> phlp: yes, was my fault
[07:20:43] <afeijo> hi all
[07:21:21] <afeijo> I need an autocomplete plugin that let me feed 1 extra parameter dinamically, example for STATE > CITY fields
[07:21:35] <anli_> Can the fullcalendar be configured to provide the feedback of automatically adding events by clicking on a day?
[07:21:41] <afeijo> so the autocomplete path handler would bring from my PHP the cities from the informed State
[07:21:41] <anli_> oops, strange way to express it
[07:23:42] <afeijo> nah, I'll use a <select> field ¬¬

[07:37:42] <GoSox> hmm upgrading jquery seems to have solved the problem, for the most part

[07:42:05] <osmosis_paul> hiryu_, hi but still dont response me any value
[07:42:22] <osmosis_paul> the select is like this <select id="publishLocationType" name="${destination.id}_publishLocations" class="type">
[07:44:53] <ccmonster> anyone around
[07:45:15] <pifantastic> osmosis_paul: Im not sure you understand how string interpolation works in javascript
[07:45:19] <pifantastic> ?p @ osmosis_paul
[07:45:31] <pifantastic> damnit, bot-t
[07:45:49] <pifantastic> osmosis_paul: can you recreate the problem in a fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:46:44] <queso> Has something change in a newer version of jQuery in terms of using . (periods) in selectors?  This used to work, $('input[name=person.id]'); but now it gives me a syntax error.
[07:48:10] <pifantastic> queso: try $('input[name="person.id"]');
[07:48:11] <LabRaTT> you have to escape it
[07:48:45] <LabRaTT> $('input[name=person\\.id]');
[07:48:48] <queso> pifantastic: ah, that's it. I didn't know you had to put it in quotes. I just realized that from the api.jquery.org examples. Interesting, because it used to work.
[07:48:59] <osmosis_paul> pifantastic, here you have the resume of the code http://jsfiddle.net/nMyRu/1/
[07:49:10] <queso> LabRaTT: That works, too, thank you.
[07:49:46] <LabRaTT> Error:
[07:49:46] <LabRaTT> Problem at line 2 character 42: Missing semicolon.

[07:49:57] <LabRaTT> thats what i get on that fiddle
[07:51:02] <osmosis_paul> pifantastic, dont worry man, i had the mistake to use the name instead of the id of the select
[07:51:08] <pifantastic> LabRaTT: can you use the HTML that your templates output in the fiddle? Because obviously jsfiddle cannot interpret whatever templating language you are using.
[07:51:09] <osmosis_paul> pifantastic, thanks!
[07:51:16] <osmosis_paul> hiryu_, thanks!
[07:51:17] <pifantastic> ah, okay

[08:28:30] <NaBro> shorthand?
[08:28:35] <supsup> to be more terse?
[08:28:44] <PrgmrBill> is there any difference?
[08:28:48] <supsup> around these parts
[08:28:51] <PrgmrBill> or is it just a shorter way to do the sam ething
[08:28:55] <supsup> we don't take kindly to excess characters
[08:29:10] <supsup> it does the same thing except with less
[08:29:33] <PrgmrBill> cool
[08:29:39] <supsup> its kind of like the light version of beer less calories but will still fuck u up
[08:29:51] <NaBro> light beer =\
[08:29:54] <PrgmrBill> I like that explanation
[08:30:11] <supsup> well it's kind of bad tho because yah it tastes bad where these 2 functions taste the same ~
[08:30:54] <Morkel> does anyone know a good tool to plot line charts with javascript?
[08:31:00] <supsup> yah i do
[08:31:23] <supsup> high charts -- free if your not making a profit off what you doing
[08:31:34] <xec> jqPlot ?
[08:31:35] <supsup> read the license .. it's cheap too
[08:31:50] <supsup> http://www.highcharts.com/
[08:31:52] <EyePulp> high charts is really nice
[08:32:07] <Morkel> Thx i will try high charts
[08:32:17] <Morkel> the website looks greate
[08:32:18] <EyePulp> A couple companies we use for services are using them, and I think we'll be buying a license shortly too.
[08:33:02] <supsup> i made a high chart that was 420 px wide yo

[08:35:52] <supsup> why not just use css straight up?
[08:36:32] <scar2> supsup: bc of a non websafe font
[08:37:37] <supsup> yah never used Cufon
[08:40:27] <scar2> yeah why wont my hoverstate work lol

[08:46:21] <scar2> nvm i fixed it
[08:52:36] <trose> How do most people implement a live password verification score? I'm trying to replicate that. I want text next to my form that will live update "your password is not strong enough" or have a scale for the strength of the password
[08:53:58] <NaBro> trose: http://labs.rnzmedia.co.za/password-strength
[08:54:03] <NaBro> something like how that works?
[08:54:12] <ravenzz> trose that's made by checking the value the user insert on the input field
[08:54:21] <ravenzz> throught an ajax request
[08:54:31] <ravenzz> through*
[08:54:35] <trose> okay
[08:54:37] <trose> cool
[08:54:45] <ravenzz> it's pretty simple
[08:55:18] <ravenzz> anyway I doesn't make sense, or I would better say that it could be unsafe
[08:55:37] <ravenzz> you could check if an e-mail address is already taken
[08:56:23] <ravenzz> or if your password must follow some guidelines you can check for it in js
[08:56:40] <ravenzz> anyway you'll need to validate it on the backend side as well
[08:57:02] <jasonabird> Have a very odd issue with .animate and IE8
[08:57:05] <jasonabird> well..8 and 7
[08:57:22] <jasonabird> it seems to be delaying 20-30 seconds before doing the animation
[08:57:25] <jasonabird> any ideas?
[08:57:28] <ravenzz> trose sorry, you asked for a "password  verification score"
[08:57:45] <ravenzz> ?demo @ jasonabird
[08:57:46] <bot-t> jasonabird, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:57:54] <ravenzz> I am still sleepy :)
[08:58:21] <jasonabird> its in a .net buildâ€¦.let me see if I can't do a quick reproduction with just that bit of code
[08:58:35] <ravenzz> yep

[09:02:10] <ccmonster> anyone used ben almans simple php proxy?
[09:03:58] <Hopsy> anyone here is familiar with televisions?
[09:04:17] <tomasm-> Hopsy, used to. threw it out.
[09:04:39] <tomasm-> anyone know how i can get a list of event handlers for a DOM (form) element?
[09:05:47] <CrashTest_> I have to ask, is there really no way to detect changes to visibility or attributes in a live fashion?
[09:05:48] <Hopsy> I have a new tv in my room (YEAHH) with hdmi inputs (no vga etc.), I would like to connect my old pc to my tv. but having some trouble
[09:06:08] <CrashTest_> Using just jquery?
[09:06:15] <xckpd7> question: let's say I do a .each() loop. if I only do the each loop once, is there any use of caching the wrapped set I'm calling it with?
[09:06:18] <ravenzz> :D
[09:06:30] <Hopsy> someone suggested me this cable: http://www.dealextreme.com/p/vga-to-component-cable-5-ft-4681
[09:06:46] <ravenzz> Hopsy that is a totally unrelated topic :p
[09:07:08] <Hopsy> Andd I have order one, but my tv shows resolution problems
[09:07:13] <Hopsy> ow yes :(
[09:07:19] <Hopsy> didn't mentioned
[09:07:20] <ravenzz> I don't have a tv anyway
[09:07:49] <ravenzz> those kind of cables are not hdmi
[09:07:59] <Hopsy> I know
[09:08:37] <necromancer> anyone have a recommendation for an edit-in-place plugin for jQuery that's simple and easy to get up?
[09:08:42] <Hopsy> I have used an other input
[09:08:43] <devc> I create an array of jQuery objects with var elements = $('#page').find('.class1, .class2'); then I want to look for a classname in the elements of that array, but apparently I can't use elements.find('.loading'); even though the elements in the array DO have the class loading as well?
[09:09:12] <CrashTest_> I would like to detect when a jquery plugin makes an element visible, and do something when it does, without hacking the plugin
[09:09:21] <CrashTest_> Is that possible?
[09:09:23] <Hopsy> and I dont know what I should doo now, ravenzz help me out of this crap
[09:09:48] <Zeph88> How can I see if "data" is empty (as there may not be results), and handle the error myself rather than javascript blowing up? http://pastebin.com/Ps5Jb6YW
[09:09:53] <Hopsy> I dont even have a cool monitor like you :(
[09:10:32] <ravenzz> Hopsy I have no experience on those kind of stuffs, anyway the pc resolution should be the higher it supports
[09:10:56] <devc> Zeph88: Can you do something like... with if(item.lname){ alert(item.lname); }
[09:11:11] <drjones69> Zeph88: Check against data.length?
[09:11:27] <Hopsy> ravenzz: how should I know what it supports?
[09:11:43] <devc> Zeph88, drjones69: offered a better option
[09:11:55] <ravenzz> Hopsy did you ask on some hardware support channels?
[09:12:07] <Hopsy> do we have that?
[09:12:14] <Hopsy> what channel is that?
[09:12:16] <ravenzz> /list
[09:12:20] <Hopsy> #hardware ?
[09:12:30] <Hopsy> list is too big
[09:12:38] <ravenzz> you can filter it
[09:12:47] <Hopsy> it's a samsung tv
[09:13:26] <Hopsy> ravenzz: cant find any samsung
[09:13:36] <ravenzz> I told you I have a crappy old tv, I watch tv during the launch/dinner that's all
[09:13:44] <ravenzz> I dunno
[09:14:05] <ravenzz> this is a jquery related channel
[09:14:13] <ravenzz> so you are offtopic
[09:14:21] <Zeph88> Hopsy /join ##hardware

[09:43:37] <ccmonster> bahh
[09:46:19] <devc> hey guys.. I'm loading an image, then re-setting the src to another image and I don't want the load to fire twice... I tried writing $('.image').load(function() { $(this).load(function() { return false; }); }); and it's not working -- I dunno how else to go about it.
[09:46:57] <devc> I also tried setting the image's data() and then in .load(function() { /* here */ }); having an if statement, but that's not working either.
[09:47:09] <devc> Short of a global variable, I dunno how to do it?
[09:47:40] <quicksilver> devc: unbind
[09:47:58] <quicksilver> calling .load() again just sets a second handler
[09:48:02] <quicksilver> unbind to remove handlers
[09:48:16] <devc> You're the man. Thanks.
[09:48:39] <NaBro> HardPhuc: does SVG work in any version of IE?
[09:48:40] <eddiemonge> devc: you might want to look at see ? one
[09:48:40] <bot-t> devc, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[09:48:58] <HardPhuc> NaBro yes, every version of IE
[09:49:34] <devc> quicksilver: so am I doing .unbind(load)
[09:50:36] <quicksilver> devc: unbind('load')
[09:50:57] <devc> okay cool. Thanks... The documentation focused on unbinding click events mostly.
[09:54:01] <Dr4g> binding question; If i have two existing binds on $.bind('scroll') and I want to remove the second bind registered for a new bind. How should i approach this ?
[09:54:14] <Dr4g> atm, i register both with $(window).scroll(function() { ... });
[09:54:33] <Dr4g> Where is the distinction here? How can i setup my binds to be uniquely referencable.
[09:55:00] <devc> Throughout the day and my trials and tribulations with JavaScript, I start out with some amy winehouse, soul, funk stuff... move into some light hiphop, then heavier gangster rap... further on as I get on a roll I switch over to dubstep, then get stuck ... throw on some Pantera, and eventually need to calm myself down and put on Mozart or Pavarotti
[09:55:39] <devc> That's the music cycle day in and day out it seems. HAHA
[10:00:12] <eddiemonge> Dr4g: use named functions instead of anonymouse functions
[10:00:50] <Dr4g> eddiemonge: you mean $(window).scroll(callbackOne) and $(window).scroll(callbackTwo); - correct ?
[10:00:58] <eddiemonge> yes
[10:01:13] <Dr4g> eddiemonge: how would i specifically unbind the second bind
[10:01:17] <Dr4g> that's the missing key to my puzzle
[10:01:35] <eddiemonge> $(window).unbind('scroll', callbackTwo)
[10:01:39] <datlap> I m using a slide.jquery.js plugin. whenever i refresh the width value gets changed . sometimes its 666px sometimes its 0px. <<ul class="ad-thumb-list" style=â€‹"width:â€‹ 666px;â€‹ ">  any idea?
[10:01:41] <Dr4g> ah, my bad. super simple.
[10:05:11] <nathggns> Hey. Err do you know if jQuery.resize works with a normal element, so say I have an element, and it's height changes (because an element inside it, height changes), would the elements resize handler be called?
[10:06:12] <Dr4g> devc: see your pms
[10:08:04] <devmikey> Question: If you write a click() function for an element, does it get executed when the element gets onClick()'ed?
[10:09:53] <supsup> you should not have both but yes they do the same thing
[10:10:24] <devmikey> i have a div element that I want to disappear when closed
[10:10:29] <devmikey> when clicked i mean
[10:10:32] <devmikey> ffs
[10:10:52] <supsup> .click(function(){$("#someselector").hide()})
[10:11:07] <nathggns> Or
[10:11:20] <supsup> this yah
[10:11:20] <nathggns> $("#someselector").click(function(){$(this).hide()
[10:11:22] <nathggns> err
[10:11:22] <supsup> use this lolz
[10:11:25] <nathggns> $("#someselector").click(function(){$(this).hide()});
[10:11:50] <supsup> that way is better ~
[10:12:10] <nathggns> Anyone know how I can detect when an arbitary element resizes?
[10:12:19] <nathggns> Like $("#someselector").resize
[10:12:21] <nathggns> but
[10:12:26] <nathggns> It actually works >.<
[10:12:33] <nathggns> I need this
[10:12:33] <nathggns> bad
[10:13:04] <supsup> you would have to keep checking it i think, like polling to cehck the dims vs old dims
[10:13:47] <supsup> resize only works when the browser is resized not an elem
[10:14:09] <supsup> you must already have some way in tho if u have the ability for someone to resize your elem
[10:14:09] <nathggns> Ugh
[10:14:26] <supsup> what is causing the elem to resize anyway?  fluid css or some other javascript?
[10:14:39] <devmikey> how do i add an alert to see if its getting executed
[10:14:39] <nathggns> css, when a textarea has focus, it gets bigger
[10:14:41] <devmikey> not working
[10:14:50] <nathggns> CBA adding to the focus event

[10:15:54] <supsup> so add a focus event perhaps

I'm trying to find a way to dinamically resize some divs on hover - http://jsfiddle.net/EE8CD/7/ - the wrapper should be constant width height, but on hover, the hovered div should expand and adjacent divs should contract. I don't know if I'm explaining this right. Anyone  can share some insight?
[10:55:12] <BFranks> Is there anything special, or is it just not possible, to use jQuery within a WordPress post? .. I've used Javascript in a post before without issue.. but never tried calling jQuery
[10:55:26] <Woet> why wouldn't it be possible?
[10:55:29] <Woet> everything is possible.
[10:55:59] <BFranks> Woet: Pretend all you have is 'edit' writes to the blog posts.. no behind the scenes work.. ?
[10:56:51] <BillCriswell> Hmm.
[10:58:15] <ajpiano> BFranks: i'm not sure what issues you are having, but there is no special rule preventing jQuery from working in a wordpress blog post - assuming jQuery is in the page
[10:58:29] <ajpiano> BFranks: by default, Wordpress removes the $ alias, so you can only use jQuery, not $
[10:58:44] <BillCriswell> Hmm....
[11:03:30] <jaequery> i have  <a href="#">a</a>  <a href="#">b</a>  <a href="#">c</a>   , how can i select just the a element with a value of "b" using css selector ?
[11:03:57] <jrockjiggz> $('a').contains('b'); i believe
[11:04:03] <sarkis> is it always a bad idea to have a form submitted via js?
[11:04:11] <sarkis> seems like it would be :P
[11:04:14] <jaequery> but using css selector only
[11:04:30] <DanV> jaequery: css doesn't know what content your elements have.
[11:04:30] <sarkis> i mean automatically submitting a form
[11:04:33] <jrockjiggz> $('a:contains(b)');
[11:05:01] <jaequery> jrock: is that a css selector or jquery thing
[11:05:06] <jrockjiggz> jquery
[11:05:16] <jrockjiggz> like DanV said. css doesn't know
[11:05:25] <jaequery> that's too bad
[11:05:28] <danheberden> sarkis: that's dependant on a lot of factors - how you handle the submission, communicating validation/feedback, etc
[11:05:39] <danheberden> but it's not bad at all
[11:05:45] <BillCriswell> jaequery: You cantry :content() ?
[11:05:48] <jaequery> but bad for me
[11:06:18] <jaequery> im creating a jasmine unit test and none of these hyper links have any classes or id's on it
[11:06:48] <jaequery> only thing i can do is maybe select them by "nth" but im not sure how practical that would be in an evolving app
[11:06:58] <sarkis> danheberden: i have a form framework written in this app via js, theres one form i'd like to have autosubmit upon clicking something... so is it ok then to do form submit via js upon clicl?
[11:07:02] <sarkis> click*
[11:07:52] <jrockjiggz> jaequery: why not $('a').each( function(){ //build a list here });
[11:07:53] <sarkis> danheberden: there is basically an extra step right now where the user clicks then has to submit the form without entering data.. would like to just skip ahead and submit the form once the first click happens..
[11:08:01] <danheberden> sure - it's all about making a good ui - so if it feels natural, and you handle the communications, validation, feedback, blah blah blah well then you'll be good to go
[11:08:13] <danheberden> yeah, sounds good sarkis
[11:08:16] <sarkis> thanks danheberden
[11:09:18] <jaequery> believe it or not, ii cant use jquery in my jasmine unit tests
[11:09:40] <jaequery> we have an anti-jquery guy on our team and wants to be free from js frameworks
[11:10:16] <Ezek2k4> I have an autocomplete field and i want that when the autocomplete is selected (from the drop down menu) depending on the selection i get from my db using json some info.. what would be the best to do it?
[11:10:18] <danheberden> too bad he doesn't want to be free from the variances, bugs and overall poor api of various browsers
[11:10:58] <danheberden> Ezek2k4 did you look at the events for the autocomplete widget?
[11:11:07] <danheberden> you can attach a function to run when the user selects something
[11:11:12] <Ezek2k4> well i think that this would be select: function(event, ui)
[11:11:20] <Ezek2k4> i call ajax there no?
[11:11:29] <BillCriswell> jaequery: loop through document.getElementsByTagName('a') and add classes dynamically?
[11:11:30] <danheberden> yeah, so from there you can get whatever more detailed info you want/need
[11:11:41] <Ezek2k4> ok ty :)
[11:12:00] <Ezek2k4> i'm just trying to figureout if it was the best way
[11:12:19] <jaequery> dont think that'd work for my needs
[11:12:55] <danzik17> jaequery: does this really have to be pure CSS, or can you do an initial selector and then just run a loop to check innerText or innerHTML?
[11:13:29] <jaequery> it's just a unit test, i dont think i'd want to jump all that much hoops for this
[11:13:38] <jaequery> it'd be a waste of time :/
[11:16:42] <jaequery> anyone here use jasmine unit test?  how would i capture double clicks?
[11:21:14] <NivenHuH> hey all.. is there a way to target a :before or :after css pseudo selector?
[11:22:22] <eggnogg> I haven't tried but maybe $('#id:before')
[11:22:27] <eggnogg> If not, don't think so
[11:22:31] <NivenHuH> yeah, that doesn't work
[11:22:33] <NivenHuH> :/
[11:22:45] <Jon47> so you want to target the pseudo-element?
[11:22:52] <NivenHuH> correct
[11:23:20] <NivenHuH> #myid:after (is what i'm trying to target to set css on)
[11:23:48] <danheberden> the only way to do that would be to introduce a new style/psuedo-selector rule
[11:23:58] <Jon47> never done it before, but the question has been asked before apparently - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5814810/target-before-and-after-pseudo-elements-with-jquery
[11:24:13] <danheberden> they aren't available in the dom to target
[11:24:33] <NivenHuH> ah okay
[11:24:42] <NivenHuH> thanks!
[11:24:48] <jaequery> is it not possible to have a dom element with an id of "id" ?
[11:24:52] <danheberden> those chrome (i think) will serve the text content for you
[11:25:02] <danheberden> jaequery why on earth would you ever want that?
[11:26:26] <jaequery> because i have a list of columns which all have an id associated with the fields from db table
[11:26:36] <BFranks> ajpiano: What did you mean about Wordpress removing the $ alias? .. I have taken working examples into a WP post and most don't work at all, this one worked in a very broken way (showed all the content and then centers on the larger image version when the thumbnail is clicked, totally hiding all the DIVs (includign the thumbnail) after the image is closed): http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/index.htm
[11:26:38] <jaequery> and currently all my primary tables have id of "id"
[11:26:50] <jaequery> i just wanted to keep it consistent  , you know?
[11:26:58] <ajpiano> BFranks: i mean that Wordpress calls jQuery.noConflict()
[11:27:21] <ajpiano> BFranks: i don't have time to get into debugging a specific issue right now
[11:27:37] <ajpiano> i was just explaining that jQuery should work just fine in any place regular JS does on a wordpress page
[11:27:41] <danheberden> jaequery but why would you be using id="id"? wouldn't that be a name="id" thing?
[11:27:45] <Mads> Wauw! The jQuery forum actually seems dead, compared to this channel :D
[11:27:48] <BFranks> ajpiano: Pretend you're talking to a decrepit old 40ish fart who started his life in Turbo Pascal on a Mac Plus.. ;)
[11:27:49] <ajpiano> assuming you're doing the right things like using jQuery and waiting for doc ready and everything is defined
[11:27:59] <BFranks> (coding life)
[11:27:59] <bjhaid> hi, i would like to know if its possible to capture screenshots with js?
[11:28:04] <danheberden> Mads - well, this IS chat vs posting messages, so it should feel a little more lively
[11:28:08] <bjhaid> or jquery
[11:28:35] <jaequery> well that would be for input,  i'm using it for my table header,  <th id="user_name">....</th>   <th id="id">...</th>
[11:28:45] <Mads> danheberden, of course… but i was just amazed over the high number of users here ;)
[11:28:49] <BFranks> ajpiano: yeah the part I think is failing is this: $(document).ready(function() {  ... which is using a $ .. :p
[11:29:08] <ajpiano> BFranks: use jQuery(document).ready(function($) { }) and then inside of that func, you can use $ as normal
[11:29:49] <danheberden> bjhaid i think there's a lib that parses html and recreates it in a canvas... canvas has drawWindow() and getImageData(), but drawWindow isn't normally available

[11:38:41] <BFranks> If you look at http://pastebin.com/K8BKdzDX .. ajpiano's been trying to help me get jquery into a Wordpress post and told me "BFranks: use jQuery(document).ready(function($) { }) and then inside of that func, you can use $ as normal" so I adapted the first call to that and I think I did it right but the next one isn't inside the function and I'm not sure of the syntax for including it (1st day with jquery and a javascript newb) ..

[11:42:51] <jubby> "Waaah"?
[11:43:49] <ajpiano> Mads: you can use event delegation - take a look at this demo which has an infinte amount of randomly generated elements and only one 'remove' handler for all of them: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/v8U3W/
[11:43:50] <danheberden> BFranks that's fine, though i prefer (function($){  $( document ).ready( fn ); })(jQuery);
[11:44:34] <ravenzz> soee if you put a function within it will be defined on document ready that's all
[11:44:43] <danheberden> soee: yeah, if you define your click handler on the button along side the function, they'd both be in scope
[11:45:10] <danheberden> but then you're defining stuff on docReady, which isn't always awesome
[11:45:11] <ravenzz> eheh ^^ his english is better than mine
[11:45:18] <BFranks> Guess I better learn jQuery outside of Wordpress a bit more .. this is a bad way to waste 2hrs

[11:47:15] <phishbot> oh awesome
[11:47:22] <phishbot> i'd be really interested in that :D
[11:47:29] <Cade> >>edit:  I'm animating the height of the areas to 0px when the page loads.
[11:47:42] <Mads> ravenzz i was just unsure how to split it up(should i include the <style> tag for instance :) finally my fiddle works http://jsfiddle.net/madskonradsen/5ULCn/3/
[11:48:21] <ravenzz> danheberden it is hard to me to explain things, due to my horrible english :)
[11:49:03] <danheberden> well looks like you're still doing well so keep up the good fight :D
[11:50:13] <ravenzz> :p I will try ;)
[11:50:19] <ravenzz> I have to go, see you
[11:51:16] <soee> how can i add some contetn into div tag but not at the dn but at the begining?

[11:55:22] <soee> LabRaTT, thank you
[11:55:55] <Mads> ajpiano i actually think that i can't use delegate in my case :O http://jsfiddle.net/madskonradsen/5ULCn/3/
[11:55:59] <sadmicrowave> ?bot
[11:55:59] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[11:56:35] <ajpiano> Mads: why can't you
[11:57:08] <Mads> Haha! Actually, i don't know, i guess that my jQuery skills not are that good ;)
[11:57:12] <danheberden> ?prepend @ soee
[11:57:13] <bot-t> soee, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[11:57:17] <ajpiano> Mads: that's not a reason
[11:57:25] <ajpiano> ;)
[11:57:29] <danheberden> bot-t?
[11:57:36] <Cade> If I have animated an element's height to 0, how do I animate it back to its natural height if I'm not sure what it is?
[11:57:57] <danheberden> http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[11:58:04] <Cade> "auto" doesn't work
[11:58:59] <Mads> but, i should also append the remove button to the tables :O
[11:59:14] <ajpiano> Cade: it's kind of gnarly, but there are ways to do it http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7641 http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7641
[11:59:25] <kenyabob> opdeck
[11:59:48] <kenyabob> Is there a way to use $(this) with child-selector? http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[12:01:43] <ajpiano> yes, but they might not be what you're looking for
[12:01:57] <ajpiano> $("> .foo", this) is the same as $(this).children(".foo")
[12:02:39] <Cade> ajpiano, would it be easier to just store the heights before I initially hide them?
[12:03:03] <ajpiano> you could do that
[12:03:25] <Cade> Is it possible to do with with data() with a group of elements at the same time?
[12:03:35] <ajpiano> it's possible to set
[12:03:39] <ajpiano> data on multiple items
[12:03:41] <ajpiano> just not get it
[12:04:21] <kenyabob> what would be the easiest way to get the first ul of many decendant ul's if i have a $(this)
[12:04:37] <Cade> I only need to get one at a time. I'm just not sure how to set them.
[12:04:52] <ajpiano> kenyabob: $(this).find("ul").first()
[12:05:08] <Cade> $("ul.accordion").data("myheight", ???.height);
[12:05:12] <ajpiano> Cade: $(".aBunchOfThings").data("allHave", "thisDataNow");
[12:05:19] <ajpiano> Cade: you need a loop in that case
[12:05:25] <ajpiano> cause you need to measure each element's own height
[12:05:30] <Cade> Ok, that's what I needed to know
[12:06:24] <Cade> I'm kind of new to jquery. How do I iterate through the elements in a matched set?
[12:07:12] <ajpiano> $("foo").each(function(i, el) { });
[12:07:24] <Cade> cool
[12:07:31] <phishbot> i is the count, el is the object
[12:07:50] <ajpiano> $("ul.accordion").each(function(i, el) { var t = $(this);  t.data("originalHeight", t.height(); } )
[12:07:57] <ajpiano> $("ul.accordion").each(function(i, el) { var t = $(this);  t.data("originalHeight", t.height()); } ) even
[12:08:23] <soee> any idea why my button (input type button) is disabled all the time? i didnt set it to be disabled
[12:10:06] <eddiemonge> soee: whats the inspector say about it? is some other code disabling it?
[12:13:14] <soee> eddiemonge, no
[12:13:38] <eddiemonge> so you have no other javascript code on the page?
[12:20:40] <Techdeck> hey guys, how do I select every element, that has an attribute "data-translate" but does not have an attribute "data-current-translation"?
[12:21:43] <Techdeck> $("[data-translate]").not("[data-current-translation]") ?
[12:21:50] <eddiemonge> yes
[12:22:00] <Techdeck> is there a way to do it in one selector?
[12:22:03] <mehale> hi
[12:22:23] <eddiemonge> Techdeck: you can but the way you have is faster i believe
[12:22:31] <Techdeck> got it, thank you
[12:22:37] <k1ng> how do i access jquery and jquery ui from iframe?
[12:22:50] <eddiemonge> $("[data-translate]:not([data-current-translation])")
[12:22:58] <mehale> say I have:  var this = [<span> blah </span>] ---- should $(this).val() return blah?
[12:23:31] <eddiemonge> ?text @ mehale
[12:23:31] <bot-t> mehale, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[12:23:38] <mehale> ah, thanks
[12:28:10] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I'm triggering an event on an element that doesn't exist when I want to bind an action to the event. How would I fix this problem?
[12:29:27] <eddiemonge> ?delegate @ min|dvir|us
[12:29:27] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:30:29] <min|dvir|us> So can I use $.delegate()?
[12:31:14] <k1ng> parent.$( ".text" ).tooltip();
[12:31:30] <k1ng> can anyone tell me how do i accss jquery ui function from iframe?
[12:31:34] <k1ng> parent.$( ".text" ).tooltip(); does not work
[12:31:46] <sarkis> hmm hey guys, for some reason running a button.click() from firebug console and from my js file are doing two different things?
[12:31:47] <k1ng> ncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tooltip'
[12:32:11] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: read the docs
[12:32:20] <sarkis> there is a loading message that only comes up via firebug console button.click()
[12:32:35] <sarkis> when i do this from the js file, the interstitial loading message doesn't show up?
[12:32:37] <eddiemonge> k1ng: what is parent?
[12:32:39] <sarkis> somehow its just skipped?
[12:32:46] <eddiemonge> k1ng: are you loading jquery and ui in the iframe?
[12:32:48] <k1ng> iframe parent
[12:32:59] <k1ng> eddiemonge, yes
[12:33:08] <eddiemonge> k1ng: where is the javascript call at? in the iframe or in the parent window?
[12:33:15] <k1ng> iframe
[12:35:21] <eddiemonge> sarkis: a script after where you have the call might be affecting it
[12:35:32] <eddiemonge> k1ng: can you paste some code to jsfiddle?
[12:37:22] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, I guess I didn't read the docs thoroughly enough.
[12:41:52] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: $(parent element or one that exists at the time of the call).delegate('yourselector', event, callback)
[12:42:10] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, so I can't use $.delegate()?
[12:42:17] <min|dvir|us> Because that would make a lot of sense.
[12:42:29] <min|dvir|us> I don't see why I need to give two selectors.
[12:42:45] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: you could use .live but its going away
[12:42:58] <eddiemonge> $('body').delegate('yourselector' ....
[12:43:11] <min|dvir|us> Yeah.
[12:43:13] <min|dvir|us> I guess.
[12:43:23] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: you cant bind to an element that doesnt yet exist
[12:47:24] <abstrakt> are there any better answers to this question yet? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3191179/generate-xml-document-in-memory-with-javascript
[12:47:38] <abstrakt> as in does jQuery yet have a decent interface for building XML? (as opposed to parsing it)
[12:47:49] <abstrakt> or will I have to write/adapt my own?
[12:51:49] <skrewt> stupid selector question
[12:51:57] <skrewt> how do you just select everything on the page?
[12:52:04] <skrewt> i tried $('body') but it was a no go
[12:52:05] <eddiemonge> abstrakt: write your own
[12:52:37] <eddiemonge> abstrakt: although using json would be so much easier
[12:54:02] <scar2> How can I have a :hover trigger added to #foo that will change the color of the cufon text on #bar ?
[12:54:45] <eddiemonge> skrewt: $('*') but why would you want to do that?
[12:54:51] <abstrakt> eddiemonge, yeah except that I don't have the choice, I didn't build the API, the API uses XML
[12:54:56] <skrewt> eddiemonge, im replacing all instances of specific keywords on a page
[12:54:58] <eddiemonge> ?hover @ scar2
[12:54:58] <bot-t> scar2, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[12:55:11] <skrewt> in my testing environment im targeting the div #container, but thats not always on a page
[12:55:20] <eddiemonge> abstrakt: well thats a crappy api. one that sounds like its meant for server to server
[12:55:40] <skrewt> scar2, also make sure to use cufon.refresh
[12:55:45] <eddiemonge> skrewt: ew. why? why not do it server side?
[12:55:45] <skrewt> at the end of your function
[12:55:56] <skrewt> i agree, very ew
[12:56:00] <abstrakt> yeah, well... being crappy doesn't change that I still have to use it :(
[12:56:01] <skrewt> but its a script used on multiple sites
[12:56:03] <abstrakt> anyway, thx for the input
[12:56:12] <scar2> skrewt: so it will revert back to the old color, without having to do a mouseout ?
[12:56:12] <skrewt> i built it first in PHP, but that leaves out our non-php clients
[12:56:29] <skrewt> scar2, no, cufon won't change colors on hover without invoking the cufon.refresh call
[12:56:57] <skrewt> eddiemonge, its a JS function hosted on our CDN that we can embed into any site we wish to quickly link specific keywords to specific url's from a simple text file
[12:57:09] <scar2> skrewt: ahh ok i was thinking of just using the jQuery I got to on mouseover/hover of one ID, it will change the cufon color, then refresh. and on mouse out, change back then refresh?
[12:57:19] <skrewt> correct
[12:57:26] <skrewt> scar2, care if I PM you?
[12:57:29] <scar2> skrewt np
[12:58:15] <eddiemonge> skrewt: you mean like those "context ad links" that popup something when you hover over certain words?
[12:58:28] <skrewt> same concept, but not as stupid
[12:58:37] <context> google: do a barrel roll
[12:58:58] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, I have `jQuery('#code').trigger('offerpopchange');` and `jQuery('*').delegate('*', 'offerpopchange', function() { alert('blah'); });`. The trigger is definitely called. The delegate is definitely called.
[12:58:59] <skrewt> the idea isnt to spam people with links and ads, but to ensure that when our clients edit their content on their site, they still retain the SEO links that we established
[12:59:03] <min|dvir|us> However I never get an alert box.
[12:59:12] <min|dvir|us> And the delegate is called before the trigger, obviously.
[12:59:48] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: wtf is that?
[12:59:54] <snover> scar2: Itâ€™s almost 2012, time to join us here in the 21st century and stop using cufÃ³n
[13:00:15] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, I used * because you can't go wrong with *.
[13:00:30] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: using * and creating your own event?
[13:00:44] <min|dvir|us> Yes, I need to use a custom event.
[13:00:59] <eddiemonge> why? whats wrong with using a class or a data attribute?
[13:01:01] <min|dvir|us> And I used * because I tried jQuery('body').delegate('#code', ...)
[13:01:14] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, I need it to do something.
[13:01:29] <eddiemonge> it can still do something
[13:01:34] <NackNick> what the jquery command for changing a tag, like to turn a h1 into h2, i forgot what function it is to do it
[13:01:40] <eddiemonge> but that body delegate should have worked
[13:01:42] <joshsmith> I've got a button that a hover event is currently active on, and then I have a .click() event that's registered and removes the class that the .hover() is acting on
[13:01:48] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, it did not.
[13:01:54] <joshsmith> why when I mouse out is the .hover() still working?
[13:02:03] <eddiemonge> NackNick: theres not really a function to do that. you have to create a new element and replace the old one
[13:02:16] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: see ? pe
[13:02:16] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[13:02:30] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, there's a lot.
[13:02:50] <Ezek2k4> url: "http://192.168.2.11/admin/genlist.php?username=" + ui.item.value ,
[13:03:00] <Ezek2k4> why this dont works when the value has a "
[13:03:13] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: because you are binding to the hover to the element that has that class. removing the class doesnt remove the binding
[13:03:16] <Elephant> it needs to be URL encoded?
[13:03:21] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: it binds to the element, not the class
[13:03:40] <Ezek2k4> i need to urlencode it here or on php?
[13:03:41] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: distill it down to its most basic form that represents your problem
[13:03:51] <Ezek2k4> i mean on js
[13:04:03] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, I'm using various plugins.
[13:04:04] <NackNick> I remember seeing somewhere where it is possible without replacing the whole element
[13:04:23] <eddiemonge> Ezek2k4: why would the username have a quote in it?
[13:04:44] <context> ezek2k4: cause you need to escape/encode it
[13:04:44] <NackNick> i want to keep the content thats still inside the div, i dont think replaceWith is it, is it?
[13:04:46] <Ezek2k4> eddiemonge im just testing i wont allow it but i wanna know how i could make it works
[13:04:50] <context> it wont work if it contains & either
[13:05:38] <Ezek2k4> so i can encode it in js or i need to encode it on php?
[13:05:41] <eddiemonge> NackNick: look at the docs for that. it will replace the content but if you only want to change the tag its a bit of work
[13:06:00] <NackNick> ok ill google a little more, thanks
[13:06:21] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: ah, I got you. How do I unbind that event inside the click?
[13:06:35] <eddiemonge> ?unbind @ joshsmith
[13:06:35] <bot-t> joshsmith, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[13:06:41] <joshsmith> just $('.class').unbind('click') ?
[13:06:45] <eddiemonge> Ezek2k4: js since its being generated client side
[13:07:00] <Ezek2k4> ok ty ill try it
[13:07:01] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: that will unbind all click handlers so if thats what you want then yes
[13:07:12] <intellilogic> .live() -> .delegate() -> .on()  Yikes!  Replacing my .live stuff w/ .on should just work?
[13:07:13] <joshsmith> oh I didn't mean click, I meant hover
[13:07:22] <joshsmith> but yeah, I feel ya
[13:08:42] <intellilogic> Where can I get jQuery 1.7?
[13:08:52] <eddiemonge> intellilogic: the future
[13:08:53] <joshsmith> Google?
[13:09:10] <joshsmith> I don't even know the versioning
[13:09:16] <intellilogic> But I need  .on()   LOL
[13:09:18] <ajpiano> intellilogic: later this afternoon i believe
[13:09:31] <scar2> how do i get a trigger to do something to the parent?
[13:09:36] <scar2> so when u hover over the child, it changes the parent?
[13:09:47] <eddiemonge> intellilogic: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/01/jquery-1-7-rc2-released/
[13:09:57] <intellilogic> Ahh, just found that.  Thank you.
[13:10:04] <eddiemonge> scar2: .parent()
[13:10:04] <scar2> $(this).parent()?
[13:10:21] <scar2> hmm
[13:12:11] <scar2> eddiemonge: www.airdorableballoons.com -- i have the code in the <head> for my selectors. my this.parent changed everything
[13:13:05] <CannedCorn> guys how would you trigger the jquery-ui autocomplete to re-pull the source/search on an already displayed autocomplete dialog
[13:13:15] <CannedCorn> $.trigger?
[13:13:21] <eddiemonge> scar2: i love how many jquery's you have there
[13:13:25] <CannedCorn> if so, a little guidance would help me a ton
[13:14:16] <scar2> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/bbDif3bf -- i want the childnav hover to affect only the PARENT. the example i just gave only has 1 parent, but imagine more.
[13:14:26] <scar2> eddiemonge: and yeah i havnt cleaned it up. scripts and plugins are adding the meta code to it
[13:14:30] <scar2> ima fix it all up first hten remove the jqueries lol
[13:15:32] <eddiemonge> you should remove the jqueryies first as that is going to cause issues
[13:15:46] <scar2> i see 3
[13:16:04] <anvandare> is there a jquery plugin to figure out of a mouse/element is within another element?
[13:16:20] <anvandare> i wrote my own (using mousemove events and calculating the dimensions of the element) but it's not as good
[13:16:31] <friedbyte> is there a channel specific to jquery ui?
[13:16:31] <anvandare> keeps taking a while before it triggers, for some reason
[13:16:55] <Ezek2k4> url: "http://192.168.2.11/admin/genlist.php?username=" + encodeURIComponent(ui.item.value) , doesnt works for " works for everything else but not the username with " or' any idea
[13:17:47] <Ezek2k4> the value is "test digitazxzzxxl's"
[13:18:06] <Ezek2k4> it includes the " at the start and at the end :)
[13:18:17] <eddiemonge> friedbyte: no
[13:18:57] <friedbyte> maybe I can get help here then . . .
[13:19:57] <friedbyte> I'm using jquery-ui-tabs and I'm wondering how, if it is possible, to have two sets of ui-tabs-nav(s) that control the same tabs-panel(s)
[13:24:25] <Ezek2k4> escape doesnt do the thing either :/
[13:25:20] <anvandare> does javascript do an abortive &&? meaning: if you have a && b && c && ..., and a fails, it doesn't bother testing the others?
[13:25:48] <NackNick> $("#block-views-new_home_front-block_1 .title").replaceWith($('<h1 class="title">' + $("#block-views-new_home_front-block_1 .title").html() + '</h1>'));
[13:26:06] <NackNick> eddiemonge: wasnt that hard
[13:27:07] <anvandare> short-circuit evaluation, that's the name
[13:28:23] <ajpiano> anvandare: yes
[13:28:38] <anvandare> hmm, that's not helping then :\ there's still a huge lag in the mouseover
[13:28:39] <nathggns> Fixed a bug with jQuery.resize - https://github.com/nathggns/jQuery-Resize/
[13:28:42] <anvandare> err, mousemove
[13:31:06] <intellilogic> I have 2 JS files, one loads after the other and attempts to get a variable from the first.  It has if(!Example){} stuff so it won't fail, but I always get a console error telling me its not defined, how can I suppress / resolve it?
[13:31:43] <evaluate> Hello.
[13:32:52] <evaluate> I'm having a div which is initially set to 'display: none' and I want it to fade in using jquery. .show() pretty much does what I want, but I wouldn't want the height/width to change. What would you recomment using in this case?
[13:33:10] <anvandare> evaluate: fadein
[13:33:23] <anvandare> http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[13:34:24] <evaluate> anvandare, works, thank you very much!
[13:34:36] <anvandare> np
[13:37:11] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to loop an animation without running into a recursion error?
[13:40:29] <dogarrhea2> hmm animating a div from  100% to 0 doesn't really "animate" it just disappears as if someone set the background to nothing
[13:41:20] <jedimind> you cant animate %s as far as i know
[13:41:46] <jedimind> should calculate its pixel height first, feed that as the starting point
[13:43:01] <ajpiano> jedimind: that's not true
[13:43:06] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/jLRdS/
[13:43:19] <dogarrhea2> .animate({'height': '0%'}); this seems to be a discontinuous animation
[13:43:24] <jedimind> fair enough
[13:43:27] <jedimind> my mistake
[13:43:31] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: use the magical animate({height: "hide"})
[13:43:40] <jedimind> did it always support animation of % ?
[13:43:45] <jedimind> i dont know why i thought that
[13:44:06] <dogarrhea2> the magical animate???
[13:44:08] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/jLRdS/ dogarrhea2
[13:44:22] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: yeah, animate supports the magical strings "show" and "hide" for dimensions
[13:45:15] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: also it's working fine with width: "0%" and width: 0
[13:45:16] <ajpiano> for me
[13:45:24] <asdasd> how do i do this: when i select a value in a specifc select menu it does an action?
[13:45:35] <dogarrhea2> hm. is there a way to make the magicla animation go from top to bottom
[13:45:58] <asdasd> I need it so when a user selects a specific value ina  dropdown it will do an action such as adding a class to another element or something.
[13:47:10] <Cade> Is there some special way to find out if two references point to the same element, because == keeps returning false
[13:47:49] <ajpiano> Cade: you have to compare the elements, not the jquery objects
[13:49:05] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: there has to be some sort of height context for the element to calculate its height off of
[13:49:07] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/jLRdS/3/
[13:50:47] <dogarrhea2> hmm i was thinking instead of a wipe from bottom to top, maybe a wipe from top to bottom
[13:51:09] <held> any idea's why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/rWc6B/1/

[13:52:40] <necromancer> held: missing ); @ end of $.each call
[13:53:40] <anvandare> i don't get it, the sortable algorithm in jquery is the same as mine, yet that one works instantly, while mine lags behind
[13:53:49] <anvandare> is it because of optimization? or am i missing something else
[13:56:07] <Cade> I found a way to add an equals() function to a reference
[13:56:38] <jedimind> shouldnt $obj.scrollLeft return the pixel value from the left side ?

[13:59:25] <nospinzy> there is no one in that channel
[13:59:26] <olivvv> I am looking at some code and it contains $(d).closest(":rd(fooBar)");
[13:59:31] <olivvv> I never used that before
[14:00:22] <olivvv> can someone tell me if "rd" is a jquery thing ?
[14:03:20] <mephux> self.$item = $('<IndicatorItem />'); will always return <indicatoritem />
[14:03:30] <mephux> does anyone know how to stop jquery from messing with the case?
[14:03:52] <phishbot> waht do you want it to return??
[14:04:02] <mephux> <IndicatorItem />
[14:04:08] <mephux> the way i input it
[14:04:34] <phishbot> self.$item.html()
[14:05:25] <mephux> phishbot: that doesn't do anything
[14:05:29] <mephux> ?
[14:05:35] <phishbot> that's a string
[14:05:42] <phishbot> alert(self.$item.html());
[14:05:45] <phishbot> will show you the contents
[14:06:13] <mephux> phishbot: dude.. i am trying to get the format the same
[14:06:22] <mephux> IndicatorItem vs indicatoritem
[14:07:25] <phlp> $($.parseXML('<IndicatorItem />').firstChild)
[14:08:12] <phishbot> XHTML demands lowercase tags
[14:09:03] <mephux> phlp: epic.. thank you
[14:09:49] <phishbot> that doesn't work for me

[14:12:28] <scar2> mmm sweet tea
[14:13:02] <Ezek2k4> is there a urldecode function in js?

[14:15:08] <jirwin> ?
[14:15:28] <Ezek2k4> os its encodeURIComponent decodeURIComponent
[14:21:03] <xarxer> Can I use variables to find an element with that ID? I.e var i = $(this).find("td.num").text();   $(this).parent().find("tr#i"), where i is the variable..
[14:23:09] <smplstk> xarxer: WAT
[14:23:25] <smplstk> all you're doing there is assigning a text() value to i
[14:23:45] <xarxer> smplstk: It seemed to work with find("tr#" + i);
[14:23:51] <smplstk> yah
[14:23:53] <smplstk> that works.
[14:24:00] <xarxer> smplstk: WAT
[14:25:00] <phlp> xarxer: you should just do $('#' + i)
[14:25:06] <smplstk> xarxer: you understand why it works when you concatenate vs when you don't though?
[14:29:07] <Spikes> Ok, guys, that new .on() event handler works a bit dodgy. I have a fixed box that is being appended to the body on certain event. Before, i was using live('click') to bind event to an element in that fixed box. With .live() everything works fine. WIth .on() i have to use something among these lines $('body').on('click', '#fixed-element .inner-element'..); What's up with that?
[14:36:27] <Spikes> ahh, found where was a problem
[14:36:49] <Spikes> should have used $(document).on(blah blah
[14:37:02] <intellilogic> Anyone know if there is a firebug channel?
[14:39:16] <Spikes> try to join?
[14:39:22] <Zeph88> I'm not seeing one.
[14:40:13] <intellilogic> Oh well, thanks.  Maybe someone here knows, I select an element that has hover CSS, I try to edit the CSS for testing, but when I mouse out... (Its no longer hovering, can't edit it)
[14:40:32] <intellilogic> OH
[14:40:35] <intellilogic> I found it, derrp
[14:41:22] <necromancer> intellilogic: yeah sometimes it's finicky
[14:41:32] <necromancer> but you have to enable :hover in the menu
[14:42:07] <Ezek2k4>  $("[id=excontact]").val(decodeURIComponent(data[0].contact))); why this doesnt works inside success: function(data)
[14:42:15] <Ezek2k4> its ajax
[14:42:27] <intellilogic> After I did it, I realized I knew that and had done it before, just a brain fart.  Thanks :)
[14:42:58] <Ezek2k4> is that normal? is there another way to do it
[14:43:03] <arex\> Can I do var w = window.open(...); and then find/manipulate elements inside w?
[14:43:25] <devc> Why are width & height returning 0 sometimes? http://jsfiddle.net/SPuTJ/
[14:44:55] <devc> The first tiem it loads they seem to have their numbers in this example, but after that (if you click Run a couple times) they just say 0 and 0 which is exactly what is happening in my unisolated code.

[14:55:35] <jedimind> i have an existing .click event on some elements (think primary nav) that triggers some scroll animations on html,body
[14:55:48] <jedimind> these click events work just fine, even when i .trigger('click') in console for them
[14:56:14] <jedimind> however, when i do the exact same thing as part of the bbq plugin, ie using the haschange event, i .trigger('click') on said elements
[14:56:17] <jedimind> the animation doesnt happen

[14:58:18] <pentarex> hey guys can anyone tell me where I can find tutorial to load different content on a same url page with ajax (or how to google it, because I dont know the definition).. thank you

[14:59:09] <eddiemonge> smsfail: eww flash. how would you normally resize it?
[14:59:16] <pentarex> jirwin: yes with ajax
[14:59:21] <CodeZombie> does cross domain ajax not work in ie9 w/ jquery?

[15:09:38] <labratt_> whats calling it after you store it.. if it connects to a database then yes
[15:09:57] <Ezek2k4> wich format should i use to encode the values in my json file if i use urlencode in php when i use decodeURIComponent in js i get a + where i had white spaces

[15:12:33] <Ezek2k4> ty
[15:12:36] <chilversc> Ezek2k4: why are you using urlencode for json data in the first place?
[15:12:58] <Ezek2k4> because i have some '"
[15:13:00] <sulo> noone want to help with my problem? ^^
[15:13:09] <chilversc> Ezek2k4: right, so you need to encode for json, not urls
[15:13:12] <labratt_> sully whats your problem
[15:13:20] <labratt_> sulo
[15:13:30] <chilversc> Ezek2k4: and ' shouldn't be a problem for json

[15:14:30] <vladikoff> Hopsy, hello!
[15:14:38] <Hopsy> hi vladikoff
[15:14:39] <Ezek2k4> any idea if php has an internal function to encode it?
[15:14:46] <chilversc> Ezek2k4: though most languages these days have a library that can encode/decode json
[15:14:48] <Hopsy> It's not my day now
[15:14:50] <devc> Anyone know anything about .width() and why it may be returning 0 sometimes? http://jsfiddle.net/SPuTJ/

[15:15:20] <Hopsy> and the things I should know is dumb

[15:23:24] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:23:41] <aaronmcadam> i find using ajax inside my css works amazingly
[15:23:49] <devc> eddiemonge: I don't understand how the width key in the image object can be set but jquery can't find it when it looks ??
[15:23:52] <aaronmcadam> and writing jQuery with SASS is amazing too
[15:24:07] <`ini> i'll take that as a 'no'
[15:24:15] <aaronmcadam> what are u talking about anyway?>
[15:24:19] <`ini> lol
[15:24:39] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[15:24:49] <`ini> school's video page - shows 4 at a time, loads the next for via ajax. when clicked, the videos on the ajax'd page don't keep the CSS
[15:25:01] <aaronmcadam> ooh
[15:25:07] <`ini> the css files are too huge to put inline
[15:25:15] <aaronmcadam> nice :D that's a feature
[15:25:21] <`ini> that's what i hear
[15:25:24] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[15:25:28] <aaronmcadam> is ur css in the head?
[15:25:30] <pifantastic> `ini:
[15:25:31] <pifantastic> T
[15:25:31] <`ini> i was hoping the feature had an upgraded version
[15:25:34] <pifantastic> That should work fine
[15:25:38] <pifantastic> it means something is wrong
[15:25:38] <pifantastic> like
[15:25:39] <`ini> the link is, yes
[15:25:41] <aaronmcadam> I'm only jokin
[15:25:49] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:25:52] <pifantastic> the HTML that you are "ajaxing" in does match the selectors
[15:25:56] <pifantastic> that your css was written for
[15:26:02] <pifantastic> doesnt*
[15:26:12] <`ini> hm.. can you explain further?
[15:26:19] <aaronmcadam> this isn't a jQuery mobile project is it?
[15:26:24] <`ini> nope
[15:26:27] <aaronmcadam> ok
[15:26:28] <pifantastic> `ini: just a sec, I'll fiddle it for you
[15:26:34] <arcanine> I keep getting event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future. is there a new alternative to these that I can use?
[15:26:39] <`ini> ok
[15:26:41] <aaronmcadam> well yeah if your css matches the content in your ajax
[15:26:52] <eddiemonge> arcanine: blog.jquery.com
[15:26:55] <aaronmcadam> yep
[15:26:57] <aaronmcadam> mentions just that
[15:27:06] <arcanine> okay, thank you
[15:27:11] <Spikes> crap, rewriteng large projects to work with .on() even handler would be pain in the ass
[15:27:11] <aaronmcadam> event.originalEvent.layerX
[15:27:20] <aaronmcadam> why are u using non standard stuff anyway
[15:27:33] <aaronmcadam> what exactly *is* layerX/Y?
[15:27:38] <arcanine> it's a part of someone elses code
[15:27:53] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: its not that its not standard, thats not the issue
[15:28:01] <aaronmcadam> Spikes: that's why the blog says "on new projects"
[15:28:04] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: it affects a lot of jquery code
[15:28:09] <Spikes> apparently, .on('mouseup' works faster then jquery ui sortable mouseup which leads to some problems if you need to do something with sortable element on mouseup
[15:28:12] <aaronmcadam> what is it?
[15:28:17] <aaronmcadam> i've never used it
[15:28:22] <Spikes> aaronmcadam, yeah, i've seen it. just saying
[15:28:28] <arcanine> I'm not 100% what's going on in the code: http://pastebin.com/0sNrhxXG
[15:28:39] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: wtf is layerX for?
[15:29:03] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: no idea
[15:29:04] <arcanine> x and y coords relative to the element that it's called from I think

[15:29:31] <`ini> ok, brb
[15:29:59] <aaronmcadam> what does jq ui draggable use
[15:30:01] <Spikes> any news on jquery ui update?
[15:30:50] <`ini> pifantastic, im looking at it now
[15:30:53] <guspe> Hi, I'm a newbie in jQuery and I need some help...
[15:30:55] <eddiemonge> arcanine: thatssome bad code
[15:31:02] <guspe> ... could you help me?
[15:31:20] <guspe> I'm sure it's something very dumb I didn't grasp.
[15:31:35] <pifantastic> `ini: You see how the HTML that is dynamically added with Ajax is still styled by the CSS that was initially loaded?
[15:31:36] <aaronmcadam> ikr eddiemonge
[15:31:49] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ guspe
[15:31:49] <arcanine> lol :( I want to upgrade it to 1.7 compatable code so I don't get warnings and so it works a bit better with browsers other than chrome
[15:31:50] <bot-t> guspe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[15:31:57] <aaronmcadam> ah u got there first :D
[15:32:05] <guspe> Oh, ok...
[15:32:10] <aaronmcadam> fire away
[15:32:13] <`ini> yes
[15:32:16] <eddiemonge> arcanine: read that blog post. it mentions what to use
[15:32:33] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't offer a standard way to do it
[15:32:38] <aaronmcadam> looks like it's firefox specific
[15:32:48] <pifantastic> `ini: So use Firebug or Chrome Inspector or something and inspect the HTML after the Ajax request.  Make sure that the CSS is correctly targeting it
[15:32:57] <arcanine> yeah I'm having a read at the moment I tried using the .on() event before but I think I'm not implementing it right
[15:33:01] <aaronmcadam> it's part of Gecko
[15:33:07] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.layerX
[15:33:29] <eddiemonge> arcanine: how did you try using it before unless you were using beta 1.7 since 1.7 was only released about an hour ago
[15:33:49] <guspe> I have a function and I have an anchor that calls the function, like this <a href="javascript:myfunc()">. I want the function to change an atrribute of an input when it runs.
[15:34:16] <aaronmcadam> don't do it that way guspe
[15:34:23] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ guspe
[15:34:24] <bot-t> guspe, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[15:34:31] <`ini> pifantastic - i'll go do that
[15:34:32] <guspe> Oh, thanks.
[15:34:39] <arcanine> I've been reading around on the internet trying things for a while now tried it before I joined, upgraded the jquery version using the cdn and then tried just writing on instead of live but nothing ran, I think I need to properly understand the parameters they must be different
[15:35:07] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: I'd suggest going to look how the jq ui draggable widget works
[15:35:08] <eddiemonge> arcanine: they are
[15:35:29] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: event.layerX and event.layerY: We have removed these non-standard properties in version 1.7. Although we normally would have gone through a deprecation notice period for these, Chrome version 16 generates a flood of console warning messages on the page. Because of this, we decided to remove them immediately. On platforms that still support these properties, they are available through event.originalEvent.lay
[15:35:29] <aaronmcadam> erX and event.originalEvent.layerY.

[15:35:56] <bot-t> arcanine, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:35:58] <aaronmcadam> but I don't understand why you'd wanna use Gecko DOM specific properties
[15:36:38] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: I'm using backbone so I won't get a chance to play with $.fn.on much, but the api is lovely
[15:37:07] <jedimind_> bah i cant for the life of me figure out why this wont animated :(
[15:37:10] <jedimind_> -d
[15:37:18] <aaronmcadam> use the force?
[15:37:23] <aaronmcadam> tried that already?
[15:37:34] <`ini> pifantastic - the new content is not styled
[15:37:39] <jaz-dev> hey, I was wondering if anyone could recommend me some rating/comment plugins for jquery.
[15:37:46] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: what does backbone have to do with on()?
[15:37:53] <aaronmcadam> jaz-dev: what's wrong with disqus?
[15:37:59] <eddiemonge> `ini: in that example it was
[15:38:10] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: the fact that backbone handles my events, not jquery...
[15:38:15] <pifantastic> `ini: but is it _supposed_ to be styled
[15:38:17] <jaz-dev> Nothing, I was just looking for anything people feel even slightly strong about recommending.
[15:38:20] <`ini> eddiemonge - i know, i meant for what i'm working on
[15:38:38] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: and I like on's api is all :o
[15:38:39] <`ini> is the .load call what keeps the styles?
[15:38:45] <eddiemonge> `ini: then something else on your page is broken or not working correctly
[15:38:56] <`ini> oh i don't doubt that
[15:39:02] <`ini> it was coded quickly
[15:39:05] <eddiemonge> `ini: no, css keeps the styles
[15:39:19] <aaronmcadam> `ini: you sure you're not using overly-specific selectors and replacing a parent div that's got styles on it?
[15:39:36] <eddiemonge> `ini: a live example would probably be helpful
[15:39:59] <`ini> can i post here?
[15:40:04] <`ini> or is it considered spam
[15:40:18] <aaronmcadam> jaz-dev: yeah, i get u, but disqus does everything
[15:40:30] <eddiemonge> `ini: you can post the link to your site
[15:40:34] <`ini> http://www2.wou.edu/pls/wou2/woutv.home2
[15:40:40] <`ini> Most Popular
[15:40:42] <aaronmcadam> jaz-dev: and I've never seen a jq plugin that does what u want
[15:40:56] <`ini> is the channel im working with
[15:41:14] <`ini> sorry.  if you nav to page 2, thats when videos start to go full screen
[15:41:54] <eddiemonge> `ini: that has nothing to do with css at all
[15:42:06] <eddiemonge> thats your modal box that stops working
[15:42:25] <`ini> i don't even know what that means lol
[15:42:31] <aaronmcadam> ah he's not binding it properly
[15:42:40] <arcanine> with the new update for layerX being event.orignalEvent.layerY what does orginalEvent mean? prior to update it was just event.layerX
[15:42:44] <eddiemonge> `ini: that means you need to hire a developer
[15:42:46] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ `ini
[15:42:46] <bot-t> `ini, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[15:43:06] <aaronmcadam> haha, delegate :D
[15:43:12] <`ini> boss is working on something else, asked if i could help figure this part out
[15:43:18] <`ini> im just a new student worker :)
[15:43:26] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: It's non-standard GECKO
[15:43:30] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: that's whyt
[15:43:47] <`ini> so my knowledge is basic.  is binding it hard?
[15:44:01] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: non-standard, Firefox-specific
[15:44:02] <arcanine> yeah I understand the old way was bad, I'm asking what the second parameter means I'm trying to update :p
[15:44:12] <eddiemonge> `ini: onclicks? wow looks like a rewrite is needed
[15:44:14] <jaz-dev> aaronmcadam thanks for letting me know, I'll look into it.
[15:44:23] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: it looks like it was added to hit platform specific events
[15:44:35] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: which you should never do anyways
[15:44:52] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/6/   adding  position: absolute; bottom: 0;  to the img1 class no longer causes "wiping" behavior. how do I make it do the wiping behavior it was doing without this css?
[15:44:55] <aaronmcadam> jaz-dev: no worries u shouldn't have much of a problem
[15:45:21] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: take off the css?

[15:45:35] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, bigdude's Following - GitHub - https://github.com/bigdude/following
[15:45:35] <dogarrhea2> i want it to wip from bottom to top
[15:45:38] <dogarrhea2> not from top to bottom
[15:45:40] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals :@`ini:
[15:45:41] <bot-t> `ini:, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[15:46:04] <dogarrhea2> thanks for trying the css isn't even there.
[15:46:17] <jaz-dev> aaronmcadam: well I'm doing research for a company I'm working for and I'm just trying to find what is out there and determine if I need to motion towards handcrafting our system or not. But I'll definitely take note of disqus, and dev into its worth. Thanks again though.
[15:46:28] <`ini> thanks guys, ill look into delegate and see if i can take it from there
[15:46:39] <guspe> Instead of calling a function like <a href="javascript:foo()">, should I bind a function to a click event? That's the correct thing to do?
[15:46:56] <arcanine> so just e.e.layerX? I don't understand what the 'originalevent' tangibly is, there's only been the one event that I can see in this code, unless I'm misreading it which is possible, if it helps the legacy code is here: http://pastebin.com/0sNrhxXG
[15:47:00] <ravenzz> guspe yes
[15:47:01] <aaronmcadam> jaz-dev: disqus is industry standard js powered commenting. But nothing wrong with going with a proper backend powered one, it's up to u
[15:47:12] <guspe> Oh, I see... Thanks.
[15:47:21] <devc> hey guys, is it not possible to customize toggle's
[15:47:29] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: just console.log it, e.originalevent
[15:47:31] <eddiemonge> arcanine: its literal
[15:47:39] <devc> I'm basically jsut looking to fade a bunch of objects to individual alpha numbers.
[15:47:43] <eddiemonge> as in "e.originalevent"
[15:47:48] <arcanine> oh okay
[15:48:04] <devc> but .toggle() doesn't look like it can take two anonymous functions
[15:48:05] <eddiemonge> not as in e.somethingyouwanttocallit
[15:48:22] <eddiemonge> ?fadeTo @ devc
[15:48:22] <bot-t> devc, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[15:48:23] <aaronmcadam> yeah it does
[15:48:24] <chovy> is there a way to hash a string with jquery?
[15:48:38] <chovy> i need to generate a unique html id attribute from a string.
[15:48:46] <devc> eddiemonge: But that doesn't toggle?
[15:48:55] <aaronmcadam> devc: try reading the docs: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[15:49:06] <aaronmcadam> before ya make assumptions :D
[15:49:23] <ravenzz> chovy there is a javascript implementation of the md5 algorithm
[15:49:33] <aaronmcadam> chovy what's wrong with just using jQuery.now()
[15:49:40] <dogarrhea2> bah. i can't get a "wipe" effect when the element is aligned to the bottom with transitions. only a "slide" effect where everything is just pushed in one direction
[15:49:43] <devc> aaronmcadam: oCome on, no need to be like that... I did read the documentation on .toggle() http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[15:49:44] <aaronmcadam> it's what $.ajax uses for cache bursting
[15:49:55] <devc> I didn't realize there was something different for a toggle event.
[15:49:58] <aaronmcadam> it says right there, 3 callbacks can be passed
[15:50:07] <aaronmcadam> toggle *is* toggle event
[15:50:16] <devc> Well go read the page I linked then
[15:50:20] <devc> Before you make assumptions
[15:50:29] <arcanine> hmm so I've changed it to e.originalEvent.layerX and I'm still getting console log spam from chrome is that to be expected?
[15:50:51] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: dude, read this: layerX is Mozilla Gecko specific
[15:51:01] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: now tell me who develops Chrome?
[15:51:11] <pentarex> guys can I execute function with window.location for example Â¨window.location = test(Â¨blah.htmlÂ¨); Â¨
[15:51:14] <arcanine> is there a mutli platform alternative for the same attribute?
[15:51:17] <aaronmcadam> that's what you're getting errors
[15:51:23] <chovy> aaronmcadam: that might work.
[15:51:24] <`ini> .delegate - can i just put this in the <head> ?
[15:51:25] <eddiemonge> devc: it links to toggle-event in there
[15:51:35] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: that's why I said: look at how jquery UI's draggable widget works
[15:51:36] <eddiemonge> arcanine: did you upgrade to jquery 1.7?
[15:52:00] <arcanine> yeah I'm using http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js
[15:52:10] <aaronmcadam> chovy: yep, definately would make it unique if that's all u care about, i.e. if you're not actually trying to encrypt something
[15:52:12] <eddiemonge> ? getting started @ `ini
[15:52:12] <bot-t> `ini, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[15:52:14] <chovy> aaronmcadam: that might work...except i need them to be unique. It's possible two get generated within 1 second.
[15:52:21] <devc> Damn, you guysare touchy today.
[15:52:24] <arcanine> okay I'll have a look through the draggable widget
[15:52:28] <aaronmcadam> chovy: *really*?
[15:52:37] <eddiemonge> arcanine: jsfiddle your code?
[15:52:41] <aaronmcadam> chovy: I guess it's possible alright
[15:52:45] <chovy> sure. A for loop with jQuery.now() could run in less than 1 second.
[15:53:07] <aaronmcadam> well hang on what are u trying to do?
[15:53:18] <chovy> unless it is milliseconds
[15:53:23] <aaronmcadam> a datestamp along with a pseudorandom number might work
[15:53:33] <chovy> yeah.
[15:53:45] <cook1es> like \n is for newline, what is space?
[15:53:54] <aaronmcadam> though there's always the *possibility*, depending on how many concurrent users you have, etc etc
[15:54:14] <eddiemonge> cook1es: " "
[15:54:16] <aaronmcadam> cook1es: what exactly are u trying to do
[15:54:28] <arcanine> http://jsfiddle.net/b5K5W/
[15:54:44] <aaronmcadam> surely he can't mean that?
[15:54:48] <cook1es> I have a variable with blank spaces that I want to remove, so I am using .replace(" ", "") but it's not working
[15:54:49] <arcanine> is what I have at the moment, though doesn't look like jsdiffle has been upgraded for 1.7 yet
[15:55:06] <eddiemonge> cook1es: that will work unless they arent blank spaces
[15:55:09] <aaronmcadam> cook1es: you might need a tighter regex than that
[15:55:28] <aaronmcadam> "/g" etc etc
[15:55:40] <aaronmcadam> they could be &nbsp;
[15:55:43] <aaronmcadam> who knows
[15:55:56] <ravenzz> cook1es are you sure that you have spaces there? aren't them tabs?
[15:55:58] <chovy> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/FPAYY/
[15:56:04] <aaronmcadam> arcanine: just use jquery (edge)
[15:56:19] <cook1es> .replace(/ /g, ""); worked thanks guys <3
[15:57:03] <aaronmcadam> u must have had many spaces
[15:57:23] <cook1es> yeppers
[15:57:46] <cook1es> does .replace(" ", "") only do it once?
[15:57:46] <aaronmcadam> that's why u need the g
[15:57:51] <aaronmcadam> yerps
[15:58:00] <cook1es> ahh didnt know that one hehe
[15:58:48] <eddiemonge> arcanine: i dont know what that code is doing but this is at least prettier and cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/b5K5W/2/
[15:59:14] <arcanine> it's a multi user canvas
[15:59:20] <arcanine> using node.js and socket.io
[15:59:52] <arcanine> I think that section of code is sort of recording what has happened to emit it to the server
[16:00:21] <chovy> aaronmcadam: what do you think? http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/FPAYY/4/
[16:00:47] <arcanine> based off http://wesbos.com/html5-canvas-websockets-nodejs/ the section called canvas drawing event
[16:00:56] <aaronmcadam> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MZjpj/#base
[16:01:59] <aaronmcadam> chovy: pretty much the same, though I always use Array.prototype.join for string concats if I *Really* need them
[16:02:14] <aaronmcadam> I'd use templating for that problem
[16:02:41] <chovy> aaronmcadam: i have two repeats
[16:02:41] <chovy> id-13203613017644
[16:02:42] <chovy> id-13203613017644
[16:02:57] <aaronmcadam> chovy check mine, i don't
[16:03:05] <aaronmcadam> though you'd need unit tests to be sure
[16:03:07] <chovy> that is yours
[16:03:18] <aaronmcadam> nope, yeah I've just noticed one
[16:03:27] <aaronmcadam> random is actually random anyway
[16:03:42] <aaronmcadam> chovy when will these ids be generated?
[16:03:49] <`ini> if anyone is free - i understand how .delegate works, i think, but i don't konw how to properly implement it
[16:03:57] <dogarrhea2> is there actually a way to animate an elements right edge or left edge or bottom/top?  Pretend that the image is just rolled up to one edge and you unroll it.
[16:04:15] <chovy> aaronmcadam: well. I'm doing something in PHP on page request, and then I dynamically add to a list and then it will be done in javascript.
[16:04:21] <aaronmcadam> `ini: did u read the API docs
[16:04:50] <eddiemonge> chovy: aaronmcadam technically it should be like this http://jsfiddle.net/MZjpj/1/
[16:04:52] <aaronmcadam> chovy, what do these links do?
[16:04:53] <`ini> yes i did
[16:05:19] <aaronmcadam> hmm eddiemonge yeah fors don't give scoping
[16:05:20] <`ini> but im also somewhat stupid
[16:05:40] <chovy> it's for drag-n-drop. I have some dynamica widgets which will add objects into each <li> so I need a unique id to refer to it.
[16:06:14] <aaronmcadam> chovy: are the widgets doing anything with data?
[16:06:26] <aaronmcadam> chovy: if you used ids from the db, they'd be unique
[16:06:27] <chovy> eddiemonge: not sure what the diff is there, and I still see dups in yours.
[16:06:34] <devc> Is there a more efficient way to do this? http://pastebin.com/gLeHgpxY
[16:06:37] <opra> what is the best way to loop through all "p" elements on a page and insert their text into a json array to send to php
[16:06:44] <eddiemonge> chovy: yeah, it was mostly for how to construct the list
[16:06:45] <aaronmcadam> chovy: he's just tidied up the actual code, not the algorithm
[16:06:46] <chovy> aaronmcadam: that's the problem. I'm using an api, and I don't get an id back.
[16:06:46] <acidjazz> how do i remove an element from an array but shorten its order as well
[16:07:12] <chovy> it's the title of a book, so my first thought was just hash the title, but that's not easy to do in js.
[16:07:12] <aaronmcadam> chovy: what's wrong with just using the list item's index?
[16:07:18] <acidjazz> like if i delete bob[i] taht becomes 'undefined'
[16:07:34] <eddiemonge> chovy: whats wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/MZjpj/2/
[16:07:37] <aaronmcadam> chovy: aren't u using some php templating?
[16:07:39] <chovy> eddiemonge: i think [] is faster than +=
[16:07:46] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: splice
[16:07:51] <danzik17> @ acidjazz see ?mdn splice
[16:07:51] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with id="listitem1"?
[16:07:52] <bot-t> danzik17, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[16:08:06] <aaronmcadam> yes it is
[16:08:08] <danzik17> bah i never remember the freaking bot commands.
[16:08:13] <eddiemonge> chovy: no. array manipulation vs string manip
[16:08:16] <aaronmcadam> join is faster than string concats
[16:08:31] <chovy> eddiemonge: i will be dynamically adding (js) to the original list (php)
[16:08:39] <aaronmcadam> and easier to manage when people use it for fuckin html building
[16:08:45] <chovy> i think timestamp+random is the way to go.
[16:08:55] <aaronmcadam> chovy: what's wrong with just using the loop index?
[16:08:59] <ajpiano> eddiemonge:  array is def faster and neater than a lot of string concating imo as well
[16:09:09] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano++ :D
[16:09:21] <acidjazz> graci .. i thoguth splice took the vlaue of the element not its index
[16:09:30] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: when u see somebody building html strings with \ to deliminate a line of code :S
[16:09:33] <acidjazz> aslso danzik17 / eddiemonge isnt splice not workin in IE?
[16:09:45] <danzik17> acidjazz: works just fine
[16:10:52] <aaronmcadam> chovy: am i missing something? http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MZjpj/

[16:12:10] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: you use .ajaxsetup or .ajax itself
[16:12:15] <PhonicUK> ah okay
[16:12:16] <aaronmcadam> it's part of ajax's options PhonicUK
[16:12:46] <PhonicUK> if the request times out, does the callback still fire?
[16:13:04] <aaronmcadam> PhonicUK: the Error callback will fire
[16:13:08] <PhonicUK> righto
[16:13:09] <eddiemonge> concat vs join is a toss up here http://jsperf.com/join-vs-concat
[16:13:11] <class24> ciao
[16:13:16] <aaronmcadam> PhonicUK: the very same as it returning a 404 or 500
[16:13:27] <PhonicUK> works for me
[16:13:33] <dogarrhea2> argh.  so when you animate from the bottom to the top via height, why are the effects different from when you animate from top to bottom via height?
[16:13:44] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: cool, I think readability and maintainability trumps the perf either way anyways
[16:14:24] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: oh, you're using the concat function?
[16:14:31] <aaronmcadam> I meant the + operator way
[16:15:10] <aaronmcadam> I've actually never seen or used the concat func! haha :D
[16:15:13] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/FPAYY/7/
[16:15:47] <aaronmcadam> chovy: why can't it be simply index based?
[16:15:58] <aaronmcadam> chovy: why does it need to be crazy random?
[16:16:08] <chovy> i don't really want to count them all up.
[16:16:16] <aaronmcadam> hm? count them all up??
[16:16:26] <aaronmcadam> chovy: what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MZjpj/
[16:16:43] <aaronmcadam> chovy: sorry if I'm confusing what you're doing?
[16:16:58] <chovy> aaronmcadam: i have to parse it out when adding to it.
[16:17:09] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: ajpiano http://jsperf.com/inline-concat-vs-join
[16:17:12] <aaronmcadam> adding to waht?
[16:17:37] <eddiemonge> chovy: i dont think you are explaining what your end goal is very well
[16:17:44] <aaronmcadam> sure isnt :)
[16:18:15] <aaronmcadam> that's a crazy perf test
[16:18:20] <PhonicUK> if i pass a key/value pair array to data for .ajax
[16:18:27] <sarkis> if i need to toggle between two buttons (add favorite/remove favorite) is it best to have both in separate divs and show/hide via a custom toggle function?>
[16:18:31] <PhonicUK> will that just do ?key=value&key2=value2 appended to the URL?
[16:18:36] <sarkis> is there some better way of doing this?
[16:18:37] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: that perf test doesn't illustrate anything
[16:18:51] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: why not?
[16:18:59] <dogarrhea2> i guess animate doesn't work
[16:18:59] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: you have a better test for concat vs join?
[16:19:05] <aaronmcadam> PhonicUK: don't manually build the string, use see ?serialize
[16:19:05] <bot-t> PhonicUK, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[16:19:09] <chovy> eddiemonge: i just need unique ids.
[16:19:10] <ajpiano> because it doesn't at all get to why arrays are a perf boost there
[16:19:11] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: it does if you do it right
[16:19:19] <chovy> something i can generate in both php and javascript.
[16:19:23] <eddiemonge> chovy: ok then whats wrong with using "i" in the counter?
[16:19:27] <trumpetmic> hey guys, is it better to animate using classes or something else?
[16:19:29] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: give me a few minutes
[16:19:30] <aaronmcadam> chovy: a simple list counter will give u unique ids?
[16:19:31] <dogarrhea2> it has some seamingly asymmetrical behavior
[16:19:39] <chovy> because in javascript i have to parse them all to find out where to start counting.
[16:19:42] <dogarrhea2> when animating top down and bottom up
[16:20:00] <PhonicUK> aaronmcadam, I wasn't going to - what I'm basically asking is if the value passed to data is serialized automagically
[16:20:01] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: that's what I've been asking the past 10mins
[16:20:12] <eddiemonge> chovy: why not explain from start to finish what you want to accomplish without saying things like unique ids or generate ids
[16:20:22] <aaronmcadam> ohh sorry PhonicUK :)
[16:20:40] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: thats css, not animate
[16:20:51] <dogarrhea2> ok infinite loop
[16:20:54] <teleject> hey, all. Wanted to let you guys know about the jQuery Summit - http://jquerysummit.com
[16:20:55] <dogarrhea2> i suppose no one really knows
[16:21:00] <dogarrhea2> they keep telling me to come here
[16:21:08] <dogarrhea2> and people in here tell me to go there
[16:21:09] <aaronmcadam> teleject: ssh we know already :)
[16:21:13] <teleject> heh
[16:21:15] <teleject> :)
[16:21:15] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: if its an key value object then yes
[16:21:15] <dogarrhea2> it's the same jsfiddle o well
[16:21:44] <aaronmcadam> teleject: are u part of the organising team?
[16:21:45] <PhonicUK> cool
[16:22:02] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: the issue is how css works, not how you are manipulating that css using jquery
[16:22:19] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge: i'm using the animation class
[16:22:34] <dogarrhea2> so.... the way it displays has to do with how jquery animates
[16:23:10] <dogarrhea2> what's the difference between moving something physically from off stage(theatre) and raising the curtains?
[16:23:14] <sneakyness> aaronmcadam: so, homie
[16:23:16] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: i know that. if you took javascript out of the question entirely, and tried doing the animation frame by frame you would see what i mean
[16:23:20] <aaronmcadam> yo, homie? hah :D
[16:23:23] <teleject> aaronmcadam yes
[16:23:37] <teleject> third year doing it
[16:23:38] <aaronmcadam> sneakyness: right. one of the number one rules I preach is maintainability :)
[16:23:47] <aaronmcadam> teleject: wow, awesome :D
[16:23:53] <sneakyness> aaronmcadam: I've got this coworker, and he wasn't even really aware you could profile or debug javascript, and he doesn't understand why our current codebase is so disgustingly fucked up
[16:23:57] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: animate changes the css value only so if you manually change the css values its no different
[16:24:10] <aaronmcadam> teleject: the time zones are against me tho, can't work out which time zone it is, I'm in england, GMT/UTC
[16:24:30] <eddiemonge> sneakyness: point him at see ? ftj
[16:24:31] <bot-t> sneakyness, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[16:24:38] <aaronmcadam> sneakyness: i'm in the same boat, tho my team are attentive
[16:24:49] <dogarrhea2> so... then how do I get the same effect if the animation is from bottom to top..
[16:24:59] <teleject> aaronmcadam the sessions are all recorded. so if you get a ticket, you can watch the recordings later
[16:25:14] <aaronmcadam> teleject: true, tho I'd like to ask questions along the way
[16:25:22] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: work out in css first then working it out with animate will be easy
[16:25:23] <teleject> we've even had people in Australia stay up all night for it :)
[16:25:40] <sneakyness> that's a great start
[16:25:43] <teleject> totally agree about asking questions live. I think it's the coolest part
[16:25:44] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge, i tried position:absolute bottom:0
[16:25:52] <dogarrhea2> what else can I possible try?
[16:26:06] <sneakyness> but how can I teach him about things like "please don't add 50 elements to the dom every time someone makes a comment because that is bad too"
[16:26:09] <dogarrhea2> this is for an image that is scrunched up at the bottom of the screen.
[16:26:09] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: i mean work out the start and end and some in betweens to see how it will work
[16:26:23] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: this article has a breakdown of what i was talking about http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[16:26:25] <eddiemonge> sneakyness: i found 2x4s work best
[16:26:39] <aaronmcadam> teleject: would it be possible to offer the recordings for cheaper in a few months or so? ;)
[16:26:44] <sneakyness> goddamnit that's not funny, I've almost punched this kid too many times
[16:26:52] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge:  that seems too general
[16:27:05] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: your test was weird just because like, it was comparing a bunch of string concatting inside of an array vs. string concatting outside of an array - instead of using the fact that you can concat by just listing all the things in the array....
[16:27:36] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[16:28:15] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: I think a *lot* of people don't realise that array literals are objects just like any other and forget there are methods
[16:28:31] <sneakyness> like, in some places we are literally joining huge arrays of html elements and then appending them to the document
[16:28:32] <dogarrhea2> eh i'll just download some extra code where the functionality works and forget about using jquery
[16:28:47] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: they tend not to realise that "two".length returns 3
[16:29:05] <dogarrhea2> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/wipe.html at the very bottom there's some wipe bottom wipe top stuff.
[16:29:11] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: the other point with using an array for it is that i find it's easier to format the "html" - indentation wise, etc
[16:29:18] <aaronmcadam> sneakyness: mustache.js, underscore templating, etc show him that
[16:29:19] <dogarrhea2> well it doesn't quite work though when u switch tabs things mess up
[16:29:23] <danzik17> sneakyness: if it's all done in a detached fragment and appended in a single call, it's not *too* terrible.
[16:29:29] <ajpiano> cause you don't have all those concatenation operators and the same variable floating around over and over again
[16:29:37] <sneakyness> naw man there is no justifying the bullshit that we are doing
[16:29:58] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: as i said also, using \ to indent the code too in a massive string is awful
[16:30:00] <PhonicUK> will .ajax be upset if you pass success:null ?
[16:30:10] <sneakyness> TIAS PhonicUK
[16:30:16] <PhonicUK> also true
[16:30:23] <aaronmcadam> PhonicUK: you *don't* want a success callback?
[16:30:29] <PhonicUK> correct
[16:30:32] <danzik17> PhonicUK:  why don't you just not pass anything
[16:30:39] <ajpiano> PhonicUK: use $.noop when you need an empty function
[16:30:44] <aaronmcadam> point
[16:30:47] <ajpiano> or just don't pass anything
[16:30:55] <PhonicUK> because I use the same method to make the request regardless of whether I wanta  callback
[16:31:17] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: http://jsperf.com/crazy
[16:31:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah, $.noop is really handy
[16:31:25] <danzik17> PhonicUK: then you probably should return a deferred and attach a .done if needed
[16:31:59] <PhonicUK> if (!callback) { callback = $.noop; } xD
[16:32:17] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: im getting string is faster in chrome still
[16:32:21] <aaronmcadam> callback && callback || $.noop PhonicUK
[16:32:24] <eddiemonge> which goes against that article
[16:32:28] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: yeah i'm getting that string concatting is really fucking fast in chrome no matter what
[16:32:34] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: you wouldn't do it that way
[16:32:57] <PhonicUK> callback = (callback) ? callback : $.noop ?
[16:32:59] <aaronmcadam> what we're talking about is simple concating
[16:32:59] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: then how?
[16:33:14] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: jsperf.com or it didnt happen
[16:33:56] <aaronmcadam> so many times it's just: '<a href=' + link + '</a>, where ['<a href=', link, '</a>'].join('') is easier to read
[16:33:58] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: what's true of really new versions of chrome isn't the same as IE, etc.
[16:34:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:34:21] <aaronmcadam> PhonicUK: you don't need ternaries there
[16:34:27] <ajpiano> some of the tried and true perf "tricks" backfire in new chrome cause it's so fast on everything no matter whta
[16:34:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah, chrome is mental haha
[16:34:57] <danzik17> and as i found out, some odd edge cases in chrome just don't make sense =P
[16:35:07] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: i think the string version is easier to read and fewer characters to boot
[16:35:24] <aaronmcadam> it can get messy very fast tho
[16:35:52] <aaronmcadam> as I said, I've seen code written by my team which creates whole divs of stuff in one big string
[16:36:02] <eddiemonge> there is no difference in the messy getting
[16:36:07] <aaronmcadam> using \ to go to another line
[16:36:16] <eddiemonge> why would you do that?
[16:36:23] <E289> how do i submit a form with <input type="button" onclick="" /> using jquery?
[16:36:27] <aaronmcadam> cuz u can't break lines in js strings
[16:36:34] <danzik17> aaronmcadam: doesn't that break minifiers? recall reading that somewhere
[16:36:38] <eddiemonge> why would you?
[16:36:44] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[16:36:59] <aaronmcadam> danzik17: unfortunately there's no build process on anything yet
[16:37:04] <sulo> i still have the problem... please could someone help to get it right and give some tips: http://jsfiddle.net/yaR9g/1/
[16:37:44] <aaronmcadam> danzik17: I'm dealing with guys who get caught on see ?ajax101
[16:37:44] <bot-t> danzik17, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[16:38:06] <aaronmcadam> they don't know js well enough
[16:38:43] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: are you talking about something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/wbh3K/?
[16:38:44] <aaronmcadam> so it's just one of many things I have to deal with :D
[16:38:49] <danzik17> that's not a JS specific problem, that's more of an understading of async stuff problem
[16:38:53] <danzik17> you can have the same issue in C#
[16:39:11] <danzik17> or PHP, or whatever with async stuff
[16:40:02] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: i think the former is preferable to the latter here http://jsfiddle.net/5dVkD/
[16:40:34] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/wbh3K/1/
[16:41:00] <danzik17> ajpiano: usually i wouldn't do += though, i'd simply do + and then indent as needed on the next line
[16:41:14] <danzik17> ajpiano: closure compiler will automatically remove the string concats and make it a single string
[16:41:24] <ajpiano> that's terribs aaronmcadam
[16:41:26] <ajpiano> bottom line is
[16:41:27] <aaronmcadam> yup
[16:41:32] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/wbh3K/3/
[16:41:32] <ajpiano> ... use templating :/
[16:41:36] <aaronmcadam> yup
[16:41:40] <aaronmcadam> I say it all the time
[16:42:04] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: yes, yes, but the code is there deployed like my example
[16:42:13] <aaronmcadam> mainly for jq dialog content n shit like that
[16:42:42] <aaronmcadam> it's getting better, but people just aren't aware of templating enough on the js side. maintainability seems to get forgotten
[16:43:13] <aaronmcadam> that's a problem in general, the guys I'm with are awesome python guys but all their programming skills seem to get lost when they write js
[16:43:17] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: yeah i wouldnt do something like that. i prefer http://jsfiddle.net/5dVkD/1/
[16:43:57] <danzik17> eddiemonge: +1
[16:43:59] <aaronmcadam> right eddiemonge, but the point is, we should use templating for that stuff in the end, much easier to deal with
[16:44:00] <Mn3m0NiC> hello everyone, can someone help me? how I can check with jquery if there is less than 3 characters typed on input field?
[16:44:23] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: when possible but i have yet to see a good enough templating engine, although i havent tried them all
[16:44:30] <aaronmcadam> especially if you're building whole dom structures
[16:44:36] <aaronmcadam> really?
[16:44:44] <aaronmcadam> underscore templating is awesome, or mustache?
[16:44:46] <danzik17> isn't jsrender supposed to be awesome?  (when it finally comes out )
[16:44:48] <eddiemonge> Mn3m0NiC: this.val.length
[16:44:54] <eddiemonge> Mn3m0NiC: this.value.length
[16:44:59] <aaronmcadam> I've stopped recommending and using jqTmpl tho
[16:45:08] <Mn3m0NiC> thnx eddiemonge
[16:45:26] <aaronmcadam> seeing as I haven't heard anything from the jqui guys about where they're gonna go with it
[16:45:35] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: well thats because its still beta but no i havent tried underscore or mustache. seemed like too much downsides at the time i looked
[16:45:44] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: i think its being rolled in for 2.0
[16:45:48] <aaronmcadam> which downsides were they?
[16:45:55] <eddiemonge> dont remember atm
[16:45:59] <aaronmcadam> heh
[16:46:00] <notanumber> Been trying to figure this out for a few hours.  How can I remove the text bits from this: http://dpaste.com/646953/
[16:46:01] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:46:08] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: handlebars, mustache, underscore... any of these are pretty much preferable to a crapload of string concat, etc.
[16:46:10] <notanumber> I just want to remove the "Mon"
[16:46:10] <aaronmcadam> i've never had a problem with underscore
[16:46:13] <ajpiano> once you have a highly dynamic app
[16:46:32] <ajpiano> with a lot of ... templates
[16:46:38] <aaronmcadam> hell yeah
[16:47:00] <ajpiano> having actual template functions stored somewhere makes a huge difference to how you approach the app instead of the markup being somewhere in the js, no matter how "templatey" it is
[16:47:20] <aaronmcadam> the only toss up with that is where you load them from. I'm putting them in script tags with the template type,  seems to be the best option at the moment
[16:47:43] <ajpiano> i am so not into that aaronmcadam :/
[16:47:45] <aaronmcadam> on one app ages ago I loaded them from files async
[16:47:55] <ajpiano> i rly don't like writing markup inside of script tags, it syntax highlights like crap
[16:47:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah, I'm reading the new o reilly book on js
[16:48:19] <aaronmcadam> that's true ajpiano, but for deployment?
[16:48:22] <ajpiano> i prefer bootstrapping in the templates via ajax using jammit or requirejs or some simple roll-yr-own thing
[16:48:25] <aaronmcadam> how do u deal with it?
[16:48:26] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:48:49] <ajpiano> this is a pretty sweet approach here http://quickleft.com/blog/precompiling-jquery-templates
[16:49:00] <aaronmcadam> thanks :D
[16:49:35] <aaronmcadam> I'm not a rails guy tho
[16:49:52] <aaronmcadam> sooo much stuff nowadays is all rails lol
[16:50:05] <aaronmcadam> django has like zero buzz
[16:50:37] <supertrue> Why is .remove('body') ignored when I test this?:  var myvar = jQuery("html").remove('body');
[16:50:56] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: what about a build process that would append the templates in?
[16:51:45] <eddiemonge> supertrue: because remove doesnt take a parameter see ? remove
[16:51:46] <bot-t> supertrue, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:51:53] <eddiemonge> lol just kidding
[16:52:10] <supertrue> right... that's why I'm confused
[16:52:21] <ajpiano> append them in where?
[16:52:29] <eddiemonge> supertrue: its because "body" is not in the matched set of "html"
[16:52:29] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't make sense to remove the body anyway lol
[16:52:45] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: before the closing body or something
[16:52:54] <supertrue> can you explain what you mean eddiemonge?
[16:52:58] <eddiemonge> this cant be the best way: http://jsfiddle.net/XaEW5/ cc notanumber
[16:53:11] <aaronmcadam> i'll have a look at this jquery-tmpl-jst
[16:53:29] <eddiemonge> supertrue: $('findsomelement').remove('remove-one-of-those-elemements')
[16:53:44] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: there's no need to put 'em in the DOM if you can just have them all stuck into a js object in memory
[16:53:48] <aaronmcadam> hmmm couldn't use that in production tho
[16:53:53] <eddiemonge> supertrue: $('find-some-elements').remove('remove-one-of-those-elemements')
[16:54:02] <notanumber> eddiemonge: If it works, I'll take it. hehe.  I just want to be done for hte day.
[16:54:48] <eddiemonge> supertrue: $('ul').children('li:first').remove();  removes the first li child of ul
[16:54:54] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: yeah just trying to think how I'd make it work for my app at the moment
[16:55:06] <supertrue> eddiemonge - what way would you recommend to remove DOM elements from variable of $('html')?
[16:55:15] <sulo> noone? :-( http://jsfiddle.net/yaR9g/1/
[16:55:27] <eddiemonge> sulo: $('find-your-element').remove()
[16:55:35] <eddiemonge> you dont need to bother with $('html')
[16:55:45] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: do u suggest a getScript call then pass that to underscore?
[16:56:14] <sulo> eddiemonge: what do you mean? where wo i use $('html')?
[16:56:50] <ajpiano> you don't need a getScript, per se - just ajax in a page that has all your templates concatted together
[16:56:52] <eddiemonge> sulo: umm, never
[16:56:58] <ajpiano> and then iterate through that, and store the compiled templates in memory
[16:57:15] <eddiemonge> sulo: that was meant for supertrue
[16:57:24] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[16:57:26] <sulo> ah ok
[16:57:39] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: maybe in the initialize function for the given view
[16:57:39] <eddiemonge> sulo: there are way too many "this"'s in that script
[16:58:10] <sulo> but does this has anything to do with the problem?
[16:58:29] <supertrue> eddiemonge: I need to submit the full page to a web service I'm using (to generate a PDF out of a webpage, using all linked css and javascript files, etc). that's why (think I) have to use $('html').  Is there a way to remove certain elements from the variable?
[16:58:30] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:58:37] <eddiemonge> sulo maybe since they are different scopes everywhere
[16:58:49] <aaronmcadam> ?proxy @ sulo
[16:58:49] <sulo> what i want to acomplish is on klick on a link i want to replace it by a form field... and on blur get the link back
[16:58:49] <bot-t> sulo, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[16:59:07] <eddiemonge> supertrue: wtf, say that again
[16:59:16] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: oh yeah, I've started using _.bind for my ajax done callbacks in backbone, works awesomely :D
[16:59:35] <eddiemonge> sulo: and thats your solution for that problem?
[16:59:56] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: lol
[17:00:07] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: scope manipulation: Works Every Timeâ„¢
[17:00:29] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: haha well, I was sort of abusing the var self = this; shit
[17:00:40] <aaronmcadam> or passing around closures
[17:00:59] <chovy> this is odd.
[17:01:00] <sulo> aaronmcadam: what do you mean with proxy?
[17:01:00] <sulo> eddiemonge: that's what i tryied but as i said.. i suck at javascript/jquery ^^
[17:01:08] <chovy> according to the spec, and html id can contain a '.'
[17:01:12] <aaronmcadam> I've got my own framework of stuff that I'm using to pass around funcs in my backbone views, so scope is an issue yea
[17:01:19] <eddiemonge> chovy: it can but dont do it
[17:01:21] <chovy> but if I use that id with jQuery selector, it is a problem.
[17:01:28] <chovy> it thinks its a class.
[17:01:31] <aaronmcadam> sulo: you *need* to read up on what "this" is
[17:01:48] <aaronmcadam> chovy yeah of course it would
[17:01:49] <sulo> this is the current instance of the class after new
[17:01:56] <sulo> like in any other language?
[17:02:05] <sulo> and makes public variables
[17:02:05] <aaronmcadam> sulo: this is like a "context" pointer
[17:02:16] <supertrue> eddiemonge: I need to create a button that submits the full contents of a webpage to a webservice, from <html> to </html>.  but I need to take out a few elements before submitting.
[17:02:34] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: is there something wrong with my pattern?
[17:03:10] <eddiemonge> supertrue: so dirty but var myHTML = $('html').clone(); myHTML.find('elements-to-remove').remove();
[17:03:25] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: wat?
[17:03:28] <ajpiano> i'm not sure :p
[17:03:36] <eddiemonge> sulo: read the book javascript patterns
[17:04:00] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: as in using _.bind() so that I can pass callbacks to my own library of functions?
[17:04:05] <sulo> i will check it.. but i still need a solution for that problem ^^
[17:04:07] <supertrue> eddiemonge I will try that. thanks very very much
[17:04:07] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: from my backbone views?
[17:04:23] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge++
[17:04:27] <aaronmcadam> excellent book
[17:04:32] <ajpiano> that seems perfetly reasonable....
[17:04:49] <aaronmcadam> sulo: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[17:04:49] <eddiemonge> sulo:  hold on a minute sheesh
[17:05:14] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: cool, just wanted to make sure i wasn't missing something I could be doing better
[17:05:48] <sulo> aaronmcadam: thx
[17:05:49] <ajpiano> assuming you know about _.bindAll, then i'm not too worried :)
[17:06:29] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: well yeah I do, but I'm only binding one function within a function callback
[17:06:36] <ajpiano> ok
[17:06:45] <aaronmcadam> I mean when u set the funcs as properties of the view
[17:06:45] <dogarrhea2> so there is no possible way to show only the bottom half of an image without extra divs..
[17:06:53] <dogarrhea2> heigh and other things don't really let u do that
[17:07:05] <dogarrhea2> i have to make an "occluding" div and some other things bah
[17:07:14] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: I've made my views' functions sort of "interfaces" so the implementation can change at any time instead of calling my library directly
[17:07:14] <dogarrhea2> what a yucky hacky way of doing things.
[17:07:44] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: there's probably a name for the pattern I'm trying to describe heh
[17:08:42] <aaronmcadam> dogarrhea2: not without maybe mutilating the image itself, css won't help u there
[17:08:44] <ajpiano> haha
[17:08:56] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: hard for me to think of it right now - i'm on my way out now as is :)
[17:09:03] <ajpiano> catchya later man
[17:09:10] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: see ya thanks man :)
[17:09:31] <dogarrhea2> why can't standards actually be easy to work with :(
[17:09:51] <aaronmcadam> maybe it's a Facade :)
[17:10:02] <dogarrhea2> i have to redesign all the animation stuff
[17:10:13] <dogarrhea2> because nothing will let you emulate drawing curtains upwards
[17:10:18] <aaronmcadam> dogarrhea2: how long have u been a web dev for :D
[17:10:39] <dogarrhea2> long enough to know everything is a hack for simple things
[17:10:44] <dogarrhea2> (like drawing curtains upwards)
[17:10:57] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[17:11:09] <danzik17> dogarrhea2: if your users are html5 compat, you might be able to use canvas ( i'd imagine you can do image processing like what u want in there )
[17:11:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah was just thikin that danzik17
[17:11:39] <aaronmcadam> and also, the good libs out there use vml for ie
[17:11:42] <dogarrhea2> i was just hoping i could grab the top edge and do it that way but that simulates having an overflow hidden container and your'e just moving the object from out of the overflow area
[17:11:57] <aaronmcadam> yes
[17:12:21] <aaronmcadam> you'd think that'd be plausible
[17:12:45] <aaronmcadam> in fact i've done something like that before
[17:12:57] <aaronmcadam> a tab of content that slides up from an overflow hidden area
[17:13:06] <aaronmcadam> on hover, then slides back down on mouseout
[17:13:17] <dogarrhea2> yea i was more envisioning some kind of flat image that's rolled up into a scroll, and you hold down a particular edge and unroll the scroll
[17:13:41] <aaronmcadam> right, but you'd need a bounding div probably
[17:13:59] <aaronmcadam> or display:block on the image
[17:14:14] <dogarrhea2> it only works when you unroll downwards
[17:14:20] <dogarrhea2> i'll think of some hack to make it work upwards
[17:14:24] <aaronmcadam> dogarrhea2: http://www.thankyoufromwalls.co.uk/
[17:14:34] <aaronmcadam> that get Started tab
[17:14:44] <aaronmcadam> apologies if it's completely unhelpful
[17:15:47] <dogarrhea2> oops! Google Chrome could not find www.thankyoufromwalls.co.uk
[17:16:05] <dogarrhea2> eh my network sucks ok i can access now
[17:16:23] <aaronmcadam> as i say it's very simple
[17:16:25] <eddiemonge> sulo: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yaR9g/2/ ?
[17:17:05] <sulo> eddiemonge: yes exactly ^^
[17:17:11] <sulo> and with much less code ^^
[17:17:14] <dogarrhea2> hrm css people are offering an alternative using clip
[17:17:20] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: any chance you could draw out what you want done?
[17:17:23] <dogarrhea2> i wonder if you can animate a clip rectangle
[17:17:33] <dogarrhea2> i had some js fiddle earlier
[17:17:33] <eddiemonge> sulo: i left parsing the query string up to you
[17:17:42] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/zGmCH/9/
[17:17:44] <aaronmcadam> ?bbq @ sulo
[17:17:44] <bot-t> sulo, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[17:17:48] <sulo> yes but that's just a little to add
[17:17:52] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: and you might want to, if this is a new project, look into see ? on
[17:17:52] <bot-t> dogarrhea2, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:17:54] <LaFlamaBlanca> does the .offset method give you the coordinates relative to the margin of the element?
[17:18:21] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: good man spreading the new api :D
[17:18:36] <sulo> eddiemonge: thx.. will check what the delegate methods does other then the direct methods
[17:18:52] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ sulo
[17:18:52] <bot-t> sulo, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[17:18:57] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: you have no idea how long ive been looking at that documentation page and not being able to link people to it because it wasnt published yet
[17:19:23] <aaronmcadam> tehee, there's still more to be pubbed
[17:19:32] <eddiemonge> sulo: if you can use jquery 1.7, you will be using .on() instead of delegate
[17:19:51] <aaronmcadam> it's so easy that it's the same method sig too
[17:19:55] <dogarrhea2> can i modify css clip by .css("clip",{1,2,3,4});
[17:20:11] <aaronmcadam> is clip supported properly?
[17:20:34] <aaronmcadam> is this background-clip

[17:21:41] <eddiemonge> http://www.ibloomstudios.com/articles/misunderstood_css_clip/
[17:21:48] <aaronmcadam> which module is that under dogarrhea2
[17:22:15] <aaronmcadam> ah right it's a proper top level property
[17:22:16] <dogarrhea2> don't know. what kind of module haha
[17:22:22] <LaFlamaBlanca> can anyone tell me what .offset is relative to (margins, padding, content area)?
[17:22:49] <eddiemonge> ?offset @ LaFlamaBlanca
[17:22:49] <bot-t> LaFlamaBlanca, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[17:22:56] <aaronmcadam> i've never used it
[17:23:01] <aaronmcadam> http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/clip
[17:23:09] <aaronmcadam> partial ie support
[17:23:24] <aaronmcadam> Internet Explorer for Windows versions up to and including 8 do not support the recommended syntax for the rect() notation. However, they do support a deprecated syntax where the arguments are separated by whitespace rather than commas.
[17:23:40] <LaFlamaBlanca> @bot-t but the documentation does not make it clear which part of the element it starts with
[17:23:55] <aaronmcadam> LaFlamaBlanca: you are talking to a non-sentient being
[17:23:57] <dogarrhea2> ok ill explore 2 ways of blocking out the top half of an image
[17:24:05] <LaFlamaBlanca> oh haha
[17:24:09] <dogarrhea2> hahahaaaaa
[17:24:20] <LaFlamaBlanca> should've read the name a bit more closely
[17:24:22] <eddiemonge> LaFlamaBlanca: i thought that one liner was pretty clear
[17:24:25] <aaronmcadam> tehehe :D
[17:24:33] <jrobey_> really? so if i say... ask about .bind() it will....
[17:24:33] <eddiemonge> Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document
[17:24:48] <LaFlamaBlanca> right but which part of the box
[17:24:58] <jrobey_> guess not :)
[17:24:59] <LaFlamaBlanca> does it include margins, padding, or is it the offset of the content area
[17:25:05] <aaronmcadam> top left i'd gues
[17:25:18] <aaronmcadam> yes jrobey_
[17:25:21] <aaronmcadam> observe
[17:25:27] <aaronmcadam> ?bind @ jrobey_
[17:25:27] <bot-t> jrobey_, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[17:25:57] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[17:25:57] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[17:26:09] <Jayflux> why did jQuery have its own NaN function?
[17:26:15] <eddiemonge> LaFlamaBlanca: it grabs the offset of the element. margin padding and borders are not part of the element but applied to them
[17:26:17] <Jayflux> when this is native
[17:26:29] <aaronmcadam> i think the native one has confusing semantics
[17:26:36] <eddiemonge> LaFlamaBlanca: it follows the basic css box model
[17:26:38] <aaronmcadam> should probably read into it
[17:26:40] <jrobey_> hey thanks! i realize it's to take care of common quetsions, but it is neat!
[17:26:53] <aaronmcadam> and jq's had different semantics
[17:26:57] <coldhead> dear jQuery, why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/c7VVr/
[17:27:02] <eddiemonge> Jayflux: because somethings made sense at the time but not in hindsight
[17:27:21] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[17:27:50] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: http://jsbin.com/uruzo
[17:27:51] <LaFlamaBlanca> it's confusing because in css positioning the padding and margin are included for the offset
[17:28:03] <aaronmcadam> it's the computed style
[17:28:11] <LaFlamaBlanca> i.e. offsetting occurs from the margins
[17:28:24] <aaronmcadam> the DOM's widths will obviously be effected by box model css properties
[17:28:59] <acidjazz> starting to use js try/catch alot more
[17:28:59] <acidjazz> pretty useful
[17:29:00] <coldhead> please some answer me halp halllp
[17:29:05] <aaronmcadam> why do u think inspecting elements in firebug shows the padding n stuff in yellow
[17:29:22] <LaFlamaBlanca> so you could tell which part was padding :)
[17:29:23] <aaronmcadam> acidjazz: I've never had to use it
[17:29:36] <aaronmcadam> acidjazz: maybe for geolocation you might need it
[17:29:49] <coldhead> try catch is good when you work with insane people who mess shit right up. you can keep calm and carry on
[17:29:51] <acidjazz> well lets say you have code
[17:29:56] <acidjazz> u konw will fail for one specific reason
[17:30:01] <LaFlamaBlanca> so just to summarize: element is always just the content area
[17:30:15] <aaronmcadam> can u raise custom exceptions?
[17:30:36] <aaronmcadam> with throw of course
[17:30:56] <eddiemonge> LaFlamaBlanca: not really. thats why when you have margins on things they push up against each other because its margin to element not margin to margin
[17:31:34] <LaFlamaBlanca> just to clarify i'm very familiar with the box model
[17:31:57] <LaFlamaBlanca> i'm just not quite clear as far as what this method is using as it's reference
[17:32:30] <aaronmcadam> which method is it LaFlamaBlanca ?
[17:32:39] <LaFlamaBlanca> .offset() and .position()
[17:32:44] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn
[17:32:45] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[17:32:52] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc offset
[17:32:57] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, outline-offset - MDN - The outline-offset CSS property is used to set space between an outline and the edge or border of an element. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the border edge. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/outline-offset
[17:33:02] <aaronmcadam> christ
[17:33:38] <aaronmcadam> right
[17:33:49] <aaronmcadam> there's the notion of offset parent in the DOM api u see
[17:34:00] <aaronmcadam> Note: jQuery does not support getting the offset coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element.
[17:34:01] <LaFlamaBlanca> familiar with it
[17:34:17] <LaFlamaBlanca> well position is relative to the offset parent
[17:34:21] <LaFlamaBlanca> and offset is relative to the window
[17:34:22] <aaronmcadam> so you'd need to substract ur box model props to get the actual position
[17:34:24] <LaFlamaBlanca> the only question is
[17:34:27] <LaFlamaBlanca> when computing the distances
[17:34:38] <ionelmc> hello
[17:34:43] <LaFlamaBlanca> for the returned {top: x, left: x}
[17:34:56] <LaFlamaBlanca> are they the distance to the margin edge, padding edge, or content edge
[17:35:04] <jedimind_> oh! i played with .offset all day today
[17:35:07] <jedimind_> that was fun
[17:35:13] <coldhead> IS IT OKAY TO ASK JQUERY QUESTIONS HERE
[17:35:16] <aaronmcadam> it looks like it's the whole box included
[17:35:20] <coldhead> IMA PM YOU ALL
[17:35:26] <aaronmcadam> fuck off padwan :P
[17:35:28] <coldhead> dear jQuery, why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/c7VVr/
[17:35:29] <jedimind_> coldhead, YES BUT ONLY IF YOUR NICK IS NOT coldhead
[17:35:37] <ionelmc> is there a gallery plugin that can make the effect from the google plus galeries ? (crop uneven images)
[17:35:39] <eddiemonge> why doesnt event.load() not listen to when iframes are loaded?
[17:35:43] <coldhead> this is the 2nd worse jQuery channel on freenode
[17:35:47] <coldhead> worst*
[17:35:51] <coldhead> wurst**
[17:35:56] <nikhgupta> I am trying to use a recursive function to do ajax via $.post.. but all these ajax calls are getting fired simultaneously.. Is there some way I can make them queue up?
[17:35:57] <jedimind_> i was having the weirdest issue today :(
[17:36:00] <jedimind_> and i still cant figure it out
[17:36:11] <coldhead> do you know how to make it go, eddiemonge ?
[17:36:13] <eddiemonge> nikhgupta: use the callback
[17:36:22] <nikhgupta> thanks eddiemonge
[17:36:36] <eddiemonge> coldhead: no. i was hoping to load another iframe on iframe load with the live listener but it no worked for me
[17:36:37] <coldhead> ryry: why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/c7VVr/
[17:36:44] <ryanneufeld> does anyone know of a wysiwyg text editor that supports drag and drop?
[17:36:51] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: ?
[17:36:54] <coldhead> microsoft word, ryanneufeld
[17:37:02] <aaronmcadam> lol
[17:37:10] <aaronmcadam> drag and drop for what
[17:37:14] <coldhead> drag those pictures of your grand kids right in there
[17:37:23] <LaFlamaBlanca> aaronmcadam: so are you saying it measures the offset  to the margin edge
[17:37:30] <aaronmcadam> i think so dude
[17:37:34] <LaFlamaBlanca> cool thanks
[17:37:35] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: is that your fiddle?
[17:37:38] <aaronmcadam> I remember having issues myself
[17:37:48] <aaronmcadam> pretty sure I had to account for margins/padding
[17:37:56] <coldhead> ryanneufeld: it is a cow orkers
[17:37:57] <LaFlamaBlanca> ok, i guess ill fuck around with it and see what happens
[17:38:00] <LaFlamaBlanca> if it uses margins
[17:38:13] <LaFlamaBlanca> i'll just use outerheight for my other calculations
[17:38:26] <ryanneufeld> cow orkers.. shit orks breading with cows.... no wonder they can't code right...
[17:38:26] <aaronmcadam> yup
[17:39:01] <coldhead> can you fix it ryry
[17:39:06] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: my assumption would be that you can't bind to a load event on live, or that you can't bind to the load event of an iframe cause it's within the iframe
[17:39:06] <aaronmcadam> my god
[17:39:06] <coldhead> and make me look like a hero
[17:39:22] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: u trollin me?
[17:39:24] <jedimind_> does anyone know off hand why triggering a click event w/ bbq plugin would prevent animations inside that event from happening ?
[17:39:28] <aaronmcadam> you're assumption is correct ryanneufeld
[17:39:36] <coldhead> man, if you have to ask you'll never know
[17:39:38] <jedimind_> onchange event from bbq that is
[17:39:38] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: whic one?
[17:39:43] <coldhead> trolling is like jazz
[17:39:47] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: binding to load with delegate
[17:39:57] <patrick99e99> if I do:  $('#foo').css({'opacity': 0.5});
[17:40:03] <patrick99e99> why can I not do $('#foo').fadeIn(); ?
[17:40:13] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: troll all you want, I'm sitting in a massage chair
[17:40:13] <patrick99e99> It doesn't do anything......
[17:40:19] <coldhead> you monster
[17:40:25] <aaronmcadam> patrick99e99: did u set a duration?
[17:40:29] <aaronmcadam> ?fadeIn

[17:40:39] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: perks of the job
[17:40:42] <jedimind_> coldhead, trolling is like jazz in that you're horrible at playing jazz too?
[17:40:43] <coldhead> css() doesn't take a duration
[17:40:53] <patrick99e99> aaronmcadam: no.. but why would I need to..  I want it to fadeIn.. which would mean if it were a duration issue it would atleast become opaque
[17:40:53] <aaronmcadam> fadeIn does dummy

[17:42:36] <coldhead> lemme load skype
[17:42:37] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: http://www.explosm.net/comics/2599/
[17:43:04] <coldhead> god that's upsetting
[17:43:54] <coldhead> at least they're TALKING about it
[17:44:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:45:15] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking for a wysiwyg text editor that is compatible with jquery-ui's draggableif anyone knows of one
[17:45:30] <coldhead> MS MICROSOFT WORD
[17:46:07] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: that's not gonna work
[17:46:40] <coldhead> two types of people in the world, ryanneufeld: people who solve problems and people who whine
[17:46:51] <coldhead> people who solve problems use microsoft word
[17:46:53] <coldhead> 6.0
[17:47:11] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: you got into the hallowe'en candy didn't you?
[17:47:57] <coldhead> not poisonous enough apparently
[17:50:32] <coldhead> worst #jquery ever
[17:50:38] <aaronmcadam> what's happend you coldhead u used to be such a nice wee boy
[17:50:42] <coldhead> you should all be ashamed
[17:50:55] <coldhead> aaronmcadam: i grew up. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TOO
[17:51:38] <aaronmcadam> sucks
[17:51:47] <ryanneufeld> only if you ask nice
[17:53:04] <ionelmc> is there a gallery plugin that can make the effect from the google plus galeries ? (crop uneven images)
[17:54:05] <ryanneufeld> ionelmc: you don't need a plugin for that
[17:54:14] <ryanneufeld> ionelmc: css can do it
[17:54:31] <ryanneufeld> unless you want to actually edit the image, in which case, there is serverside code involved
[17:55:22] <unruthless> ionelmc: ryanneufeld is right. the relevant css property is overflow: hidden;
[17:57:15] <ionelmc> nah that's not the effect they have
[17:57:46] <ryanneufeld> ionelmc: what effect are you talking about?
[17:57:53] <ryanneufeld> link me to an image on gplus
[17:57:56] <ionelmc> https://plus.google.com/photos/106436370949746015255/albums/5454200710094111393
[17:57:59] <ionelmc> check that out
[17:58:03] <ionelmc> it looks great
[17:58:12] <ionelmc> though they crop the images
[17:58:20] <ionelmc> and some images appear bigger
[17:58:33] <ryanneufeld> that's css
[17:58:49] <ryanneufeld> with a hover binding that removes the overflow
[17:59:06] <ionelmc> yeah that easy as pie
[17:59:17] <ionelmc> though matching the crops is not ?
[17:59:50] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:59:59] <ryanneufeld> that's a little harder
[18:00:03] <ionelmc> so is there any plugin that does that?
[18:00:08] <ionelmc> i'm very lazy :)
[18:00:08] <ryanneufeld> masonry
[18:00:19] <ryanneufeld> will do a similar effect
[18:00:28] <ryanneufeld> *note* SIMILAR
[18:00:35] <ryanneufeld> it expects a column width
[18:00:49] <ryanneufeld> so items can be wider than a given column, etc
[18:01:05] <ryanneufeld> but they must be a multiple of them
[18:01:05] <ionelmc> i can start with that i think
[18:01:17] <ryanneufeld> yeah, what google it seems is doing is actually serving two images
[18:01:21] <ryanneufeld> one in a hidden div
[18:01:28] <ryanneufeld> that they show when you mouse over
[18:01:29] <nikhgupta> is it possible to use a while loop with a condition that is modified via the ajax calls?
[18:01:34] <ryanneufeld> at least thats' ahat I think
[18:01:37] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: no
[18:02:00] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: well, kinda, but mostly no.
[18:02:27] <ryanneufeld> ionelmc: i'm on a 13" screen at the moment so I could be wrong, but that's what it seem to be doing to me
[18:02:57] <ionelmc> ryanneufeld: well yeah they calculate the ordering and cropping in their backend - but i'm sure something a bit more lousy can be done with javascript
[18:03:29] <nikhgupta> ryanneufeld, so lets say I have a function which pushes new results to a list and removes the top element of the list... is there a way I can loop through each of the element? every element of this list may give rise to more elements depending on result of ajax calls
[18:04:10] <ryanneufeld> ionelmc: yeah, you prolly wanna do it on the back end though, then you can cache the order, and the browser doesn't have to do it every time
[18:05:27] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: so you have a FIFO queue?
[18:06:05] <nikhgupta> no... last in, first out... but its being modified via ajax calls
[18:06:19] <ryanneufeld> so you have push and pop
[18:06:35] <ryanneufeld> you have a stack?
[18:06:39] <jrobey_> push and pop are the only way to go in that case - in a while loop, yep.
[18:06:49] <nikhgupta> hmm
[18:06:53] <ryanneufeld> ?p nikhgupta
[18:06:54] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:07:04] <jrobey_> while((item=list.pop()){do something with item...}
[18:07:22] <ryanneufeld> jrobey_: but he wants list to be modified by ajax calls
[18:07:27] <ryanneufeld> which is scary
[18:07:38] <ryanneufeld> could end up in an infinite loop
[18:07:44] <ryanneufeld> which would be blocking, and bad
[18:08:03] <nikhgupta> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/502612/
[18:08:07] <jrobey_> it can be modifed in loop. This comes up - when deleting items sometimes - which is why i know it right away. I imagine he wants to loop continaully based on newly received results
[18:08:31] <ryanneufeld> jrobey_: I get that
[18:08:41] <ryanneufeld> I'm saying basing that off an ajax call is a bad idea
[18:08:45] <jrobey_> but just adding to a list while removing in a loop isn't bad - even from ajax. Where's the infinite loop coming from?
[18:09:13] <jrobey_> just curious - not that i can think of a good reason to do it myself :)
[18:09:15] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: what you have done is FIFO not FILO
[18:09:35] <ryanneufeld> ?mdc shift @ nikhgupta
[18:09:37] <bot-t> nikhgupta, shift - MDN - Removes the first element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift
[18:09:47] <nikhgupta> ?mdc push
[18:09:48] <bot-t> nikhgupta, push - MDN - Mutates an array by appending the given elements and returning the new length of the array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[18:09:56] <ryanneufeld> right
[18:10:03] <nikhgupta> right.
[18:10:07] <nikhgupta> sorry. :/
[18:10:10] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: you want pop()
[18:10:16] <ryanneufeld> if you want a stack
[18:10:21] <jrobey_> i forgot about shift! i'll go use it now, actually. heh.
[18:10:26] <ryanneufeld> lol
[18:10:38] <ryanneufeld> shift, unshift, pop, push
[18:10:40] <ryanneufeld> all very handy
[18:11:08] <jrobey_> is shift less efficient then pop (for having to alter indexes unlike removing the last element?
[18:11:11] <ryanneufeld> where's coldhead to make an inappropriate comment when you need him?
[18:11:33] <ryanneufeld> jrobey_: I'm not sure, but if it is, it's insigificant for most tasks
[18:11:40] <aaronmcadam> if u want the last element removed, use pop yeah
[18:12:00] <ryanneufeld> jrobey_: it's really good if you want to get the first element from the array AND remove it
[18:12:10] <jrobey_> i may have thousands of elements use either shift or pop depending on the UI... i do def. def. wonder if it takes more time or not!
[18:12:21] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: I'm looking at your code  little more
[18:12:26] <ryanneufeld> jrobey_: jsperf.org
[18:12:43] <danzik17> yes, shift is less efficient than pop
[18:13:10] <nikhgupta> ryanneufeld, i have removed a bunch of lines from the function, which is in reality making use of the iterations on ajax calls..
[18:13:38] <jrobey_> i would have guessed as much, but the confirmation is well received!
[18:13:47] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: yeah, well, it's hard to help if i can't see exactly what you are doing
[18:14:33] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: that seems really really inefficient what you're doing there
[18:14:34] <nikhgupta> for the retrieved ajax, the other data is list of files, which I am simply outputting in a div element.
[18:14:48] <nikhgupta> hmm.. can you point me to somewhere?
[18:14:52] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: mind if I ask what problem this is supposed to solve?
[18:15:08] <danzik17> nikhgupta: whats the goal here - you just want to keep getting directories (or whatever dir is) and render some element until there are no more dirs?
[18:15:18] <nikhgupta> exactly.
[18:15:21] <ryanneufeld> it looks like you're attempting to recurse through directories till you reach the end
[18:15:26] <nikhgupta> yes
[18:15:31] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: you're really better off doing that server side
[18:15:32] <nikhgupta> prepare a list of all files
[18:15:55] <ryanneufeld> if you're using PHP it has commands that will just give you an array of the dir contents
[18:15:57] <ryanneufeld> in one shot
[18:16:08] <ryanneufeld> then you can json encode it and return it
[18:16:13] <jrobey_> why not recurse on the server side entirely and send it as json? Yesh - what ryanneufeld said. If the list is TRULY that big, then "lazy load".. make an ajax call to fill in a directory on reveal, not load
[18:16:22] <nikhgupta> yes, I know.. I am efficient with PHP only :P but thing is I need to do that on client side.
[18:16:50] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: so if you have a directory of 100 files, you're doing to do 100+ http round trips?
[18:16:59] <ryanneufeld> when you could do it in one?
[18:17:00] <nikhgupta> jrobey_, can you please elaborate on "make an ajax call to fill in a directory on reveal, not load"
[18:17:28] <nikhgupta> thing is
[18:17:40] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.scandir.php
[18:17:45] <jrobey_> well it has to do with your UI - but you could, say, only load the contents of the root dir '/' and only load the children when (for example) the disclosure triangle of that folder is clicked
[18:18:12] <jrobey_> why load the listing from directories your client will never look at?
[18:18:34] <nikhgupta> I am working in a subsidiary company to a larger company.. and, hence do not have server side control... and I am novice when it comes to jquery
[18:19:31] <nikhgupta> so for the moment, if i may ask, can I somehow loop over this list?
[18:19:47] <jrobey_> well - i would recommend you look at jquery templates and think about using json or xml to paint results recursively. if it's all client side, it sounds like that approach makes sense.
[18:20:04] <jrobey_> (i LOVE templates)
[18:20:15] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_++++++++
[18:20:29] <ryanneufeld> nikhgupta: what is probe? can you share the kind of data it returns?
[18:20:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[18:20:48] <aaronmcadam> his boss kicked him
[18:20:54] <aaronmcadam> "you told them too much"
[18:21:54] <ryanneufeld> lol
[18:21:57] <jrobey_> lol, templates (aside from accessiblity issues) are way too powerful for the traditioal business. you can't reliably charge by the hour when it's that easy!
[18:22:18] <aaronmcadam> accessibility?
[18:22:32] <blognewb> hi guys... i just could not figure out what data type i would put in doing a $.post.. im trying to pass a date mm-dd-yyyy but it has GMT etc, and the MySQL value i want to update to be replaced is in "datetime" data type.. :'(
[18:22:53] <aaronmcadam> you could still fall back to something, anything that will be better than string concat
[18:23:12] <ryanneufeld> ?$.post @ blognewb
[18:23:13] <bot-t> blognewb, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[18:23:14] <jrobey_> yah - most screen readers and the like are never going to see what you draw from client side templates - that requires execution, not loading. The entire "semantic web" thing is kicked in the nuts by tempating - and that's okay, for what it does
[18:23:40] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: it's not going to be semantic in those terms anyway
[18:23:59] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: tho ARIA is meant to help with that
[18:24:09] <jrobey_> quite right - i just mean that human input chooses what to show, so a screen reader would be out of luck. Huh, i don't know what ARIA is
[18:24:13] <NackNick> can someone point me in the right direction im trying to change one word in a url thats being used multiple times
[18:24:24] <aaronmcadam> ?g ARIA @ jrobey_
[18:24:25] <bot-t> jrobey_, Las Vegas Hotels - ARIA Rooms at CityCenter - http://www.arialasvegas.com/
[18:24:28] <aaronmcadam> ha!
[18:24:32] <ryanneufeld> blognewb: you can pass an object or a query string
[18:24:35] <aaronmcadam> ?g ARIA standard @ jrobey_
[18:24:36] <bot-t> jrobey_, WAI-ARIA Overview - http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria
[18:24:55] <blognewb> ryanneufeld ok ryanneufeld thank you i'll do a little more reading
[18:25:01] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: it's a standard for specifying ajax content
[18:25:02] <ryanneufeld> yup
[18:25:08] <ryanneufeld> blognewb: if you can't sort it out ?p
[18:25:10] <ryanneufeld> ?
[18:25:13] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ blognewb
[18:25:14] <bot-t> blognewb, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:25:21] <jrobey_> ?replace @ NackNick
[18:25:21] <bot-t> NackNick, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[18:25:24] <blognewb> oh
[18:25:26] <blognewb> ok
[18:25:27] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: so you'd add aria attrs ur static html parent nodes saying "this content will change"
[18:25:44] <jrobey_> (i tried, it put repace with instead of replace. ah well)
[18:26:07] <jrobey_> @aaronmcadam reading...
[18:26:18] <aaronmcadam> jrobey_: jqmobile uses it
[18:27:47] <ryanneufeld> so does a lot of jquery-ui
[18:28:00] <aaronmcadam> yeah, same guys, filament
[18:28:09] <aaronmcadam> their book on prog enhancement is awesome
[18:28:19] <aaronmcadam> still haven't read it all tho, like most of my bookshelf
[18:28:24] <aaronmcadam> which is too small lol
[18:28:42] <jrobey_> well - that is very cool. And good to know! still doesn't make templates work - and i don't know if it's widespread in use - but anything in that direction is fantastic. to hell with 508!(ahem, I mean, i hope we get good enough to not need it!)
[18:28:59] <aaronmcadam> 508?
[18:29:27] <ryanneufeld> ?g standard 508
[18:29:28] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Section 508 - http://www.section508.gov/
[18:29:29] <jrobey_> section 508 is the restriction set by the US government that websites MUST be accessbile to those with disabnilities
[18:29:30] <aaronmcadam> templates just make your app more maintainable
[18:30:04] <aaronmcadam> they're not gonna solve any issues around a11y
[18:30:23] <aaronmcadam> because js content right now already ignores that
[18:30:28] <jrobey_> like any JS, they make the page harder for acceibility and search. I WISH i could use it anywhere. I have a friend who works on the website at NatGEO, and the very idea of templates was laughed out of the room, because of those issues
[18:30:46] <aaronmcadam> they're missing the whole point
[18:31:09] <aaronmcadam> templates are for consuming APIs n such
[18:31:14] <aaronmcadam> they're not for static content
[18:31:46] <aaronmcadam> they're for content that would have been buried in js anyway
[18:31:51] <jrobey_> correct - except that - say - painting craigslist postings in realtime is quite useful, but can't be done for accessibility reasons on any site that the general public would hit
[18:32:03] <jrobey_> not true, it's not just for obscure code
[18:32:28] <aaronmcadam> I meant built with strings
[18:32:39] <aaronmcadam> horrible masses of concatted html
[18:32:48] <jrobey_> but it's 6 of one half dozen of the other. I just wish screen readers would show what's been evaluated, not what came down the wire first!
[18:33:10] <aaronmcadam> it's cuz screen readers are just bots
[18:33:15] <aaronmcadam> they don't have dom parsers ;)
[18:33:20] <aaronmcadam> well maybe they do
[18:33:23] <aaronmcadam> but no js engines
[18:33:26] <aaronmcadam> maybe?
[18:33:29] <aaronmcadam> hehe :D
[18:33:29] <ryanneufeld> anyone worked with CL-editor?
[18:33:39] <ryanneufeld> http://premiumsoftware.net/cleditor/
[18:33:40] <ryanneufeld> ?
[18:33:43] <aaronmcadam> Cloud9 is awesome
[18:33:44] <jrobey_> i agree - but being who I am (an ex-laszlo aficionado) i want templates everywhere. Hey.. even our freaking phones have DOM parsers all over the place :)
[18:33:58] <aaronmcadam> laszlo? don't get the ref
[18:33:59] <ryanneufeld> cloud 9 is not what i'm after here...
[18:34:06] <jrobey_> openlaszlo.org
[18:34:09] <labratt> i like tinyMCE
[18:34:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah, some sort of drag n drop thing?
[18:34:18] <aaronmcadam> that supports ui?
[18:34:28] <aaronmcadam> don't get it
[18:34:29] <jrobey_> a RIA toolkit that rocked it, before I found jquery templates (true story, that was a big find, for me)
[18:34:47] <aaronmcadam> kk
[18:34:49] <jrobey_> it's a long story :)
[18:35:11] <aaronmcadam> it all depends on how the readers even parse the html
[18:35:21] <jrobey_> so ryanneufeld http://jsperf.org/ doesn't load?
[18:35:27] <labratt> what is cloud9
[18:35:38] <aaronmcadam> ?g cloud9 @ labratt
[18:35:39] <bot-t> labratt, Cloud9 - Your code anywhere, anytime - http://c9.io/
[18:35:41] <ryanneufeld> jrobey_: so you didn't google it?
[18:35:48] <ryanneufeld> I mistyped the url
[18:35:50] <ryanneufeld> it's jsperf.com
[18:36:03] <labratt> i use jsfiddle
[18:36:09] <labratt> like that
[18:36:11] <aaronmcadam> labratt: you can run it locally on node. awesome code inspection
[18:36:20] <labratt> cool
[18:36:21] <jrobey_> believe it or not, i'm on a phone - i didn't google :)
[18:36:24] <labratt> i'll check it out
[18:36:29] <aaronmcadam> labratt: console integration is nice too
[18:36:36] <aaronmcadam> labratt: and debugging
[18:37:10] <jrobey_> huh, cool! thx. this is the first public IRC channel i've been on in years, today. Nice to meet you all, l8r!
[18:37:12] <aaronmcadam> and jslint integration with the inspection, really nice
[18:40:14] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: I've been meaning to play with it more
[18:40:24] <ryanneufeld> now that I found that bitbucket does free private repos
[18:40:28] <ryanneufeld> i"m using that for my projects
[18:40:39] <ryanneufeld> and github for open source stuff I want to work with
[18:41:18] <ryanneufeld> AND then I get this: "You need a Premium account to be able to clone a private bitbucket project." Fuuuuu
[18:41:29] <aaronmcadam> lol
[18:41:42] <aaronmcadam> I just pay the measly amount to github every month
[18:41:56] <ryanneufeld> $15/month?
[18:41:58] <ryanneufeld> fuck that
[18:41:58] <labratt> aww i really wanted to try the clone feature on Cloud9 but its not working right now
[18:41:59] <ryanneufeld> lol
[18:41:59] <coldhead> sucker
[18:42:12] <aaronmcadam> it's only £9
[18:42:14] <aaronmcadam> that's nothing
[18:42:32] <aaronmcadam> dollars are crap :P
[18:42:45] <RaviJK> Hi
[18:42:58] <ryanneufeld> $7/month for github... nah
[18:43:02] <RaviJK> Looking for some help with JSONP & Jquery.
[18:43:03] <ryanneufeld> I can host my own for less :p
[18:43:06] <aaronmcadam> can't expect everything for free
[18:43:10] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @RaviJK
[18:43:11] <bot-t> RaviJK, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:43:15] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: I don't
[18:43:16] <aaronmcadam> github's features are awesome tho so bleh
[18:43:21] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: I just can't afford it right now
[18:43:23] <aaronmcadam> worth paying for
[18:43:34] <aaronmcadam> sorry to hear that
[18:43:34] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: when I have my own servers at home
[18:43:38] <RaviJK> I am trying to implement cascading cross domain requests
[18:43:48] <RaviJK> can i post code here for you to review ?
[18:43:52] <ryanneufeld> NO
[18:43:57] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ RaviJK
[18:43:57] <bot-t> RaviJK, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:43:59] <aaronmcadam> is there an equivalent of hg serve for git?
[18:44:06] <aaronmcadam> surely somebody has worked on one?
[18:44:15] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: ask in #git
[18:44:26] <aaronmcadam> u kno what i'm talkin bout tho?
[18:44:52] <ryanneufeld> yes
[18:44:53] <aaronmcadam> there are some mac only apps out there
[18:45:01] <aaronmcadam> but they suck when I tried em
[18:45:08] <aaronmcadam> back on linux nowadays
[18:45:21] <RaviJK> ryanneufeld http://paste.pocoo.org/show/502620/
[18:45:51] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: have you used git dude yet?
[18:45:56] <RaviJK> essentially i need to make multiple requests , not sure if that is allowed
[18:46:04] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: yes, it is
[18:46:08] <ryanneufeld> but that's a shitty way
[18:46:15] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: yes, I'm using it now
[18:46:23] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: it's cool isn't it
[18:46:27] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: working on getting people at work moved over from SVN
[18:46:32] <ryanneufeld> git svn will make that easier
[18:46:40] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: I'm on a jqmobile app so need to know when changes are pushed
[18:46:50] <RaviJK> the problem is, i am trying to implment CAS client in javascript
[18:46:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah not too sure on how deep the support goes with git svn tho
[18:47:12] <aaronmcadam> i was pushing for git but then they went with hg
[18:47:15] <aaronmcadam> which is fine
[18:47:22] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: CAS?
[18:47:22] <aaronmcadam> pretty much the same
[18:47:30] <aaronmcadam> just without staging which i never used anyway
[18:47:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:47:39] <RaviJK> Central Authentication Service
[18:47:57] <aaronmcadam> aah
[18:48:02] <aaronmcadam> that's inception right there
[18:48:19] <aaronmcadam> nested ajax woweeee alice in wonderland stuff
[18:48:28] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: looking at your code, the first one is jsonp, which is correct
[18:48:33] <ryanneufeld> the second one isn't
[18:48:38] <aaronmcadam> heheh
[18:48:48] <ryanneufeld> but you don't need jsonp unless the domain is different
[18:48:56] <RaviJK> they are
[18:49:21] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: wouldn't what you're doing be better suited to a node app?
[18:49:37] <aaronmcadam> if you need all these requests going
[18:49:49] <RaviJK> they are being called from Drupal
[18:49:54] <RaviJK> js lives on Drupal
[18:49:57] <aaronmcadam> oh.kay.
[18:50:03] <RaviJK> and requests goto Jasig-CAS
[18:50:15] <aaronmcadam> and why do u need ajax?
[18:50:22] <coldhead> can i just say that listening to Dev-o LIVE is the best debugging aid to jquery ever?
[18:50:23] <aaronmcadam> to login without a reload?
[18:50:32] <coldhead> ajpiano should mention it in fixing theses jqueries
[18:50:35] <RaviJK> for setting up a cross domain Single Sign ON
[18:50:42] <aaronmcadam> haha coldhead was just bout to say that to ye
[18:50:57] <coldhead> ajpiano: do it or i'll kill you
[18:50:58] <RaviJK> aaronmcadam, did some metrics and looks like we were going to struggle with scalability
[18:51:03] <aaronmcadam> right RaviJK we were looking at doing something like that at my place
[18:51:05] <RaviJK> so plugged in Varnish
[18:51:09] <aaronmcadam> yep
[18:51:13] <aaronmcadam> is it nice?
[18:51:16] <RaviJK> and that got us trapped
[18:51:32] <RaviJK> we cannot do cookies validations on each request
[18:51:37] <aaronmcadam> i think if ur arch is flawed, varnish might not help that much
[18:51:42] <RaviJK> so trying to do user authentication on the edge
[18:52:00] <aaronmcadam> and you're gonna depend on js for auth?
[18:52:09] <labratt> is anyone else having issues using cloud9 right now
[18:52:21] <RaviJK> initial auth is done by Drupal
[18:52:22] <aaronmcadam> labratt: clone the repo and run it
[18:52:41] <RaviJK> subsequent authentication is done by Jasig-Cas which is seperate server
[18:52:55] <RaviJK> with REST interfaces
[18:52:59] <aaronmcadam> right
[18:53:08] <aaronmcadam> and can u do that from your php?
[18:53:17] <RaviJK> so i was trying to do auth on the edge using js and cas
[18:53:25] <RaviJK> so never have to hit drupal again
[18:53:28] <aaronmcadam> just wondering where u *need* js
[18:53:36] <RaviJK> its on the edge
[18:53:44] <aaronmcadam> on the edge?
[18:53:46] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean
[18:53:47] <RaviJK> basically requests go from browser to varnish and back
[18:54:02] <RaviJK> Edge is varnish, which sits in front of Apache
[18:54:08] <aaronmcadam> right ok
[18:54:10] <RaviJK> Reverse proxies
[18:54:13] <aaronmcadam> k
[18:54:27] <aaronmcadam> does it work without js
[18:54:44] <RaviJK> the plan is ..when page is published by Drupal, page along with JS is cached by Varnish
[18:55:10] <aaronmcadam> right but you're still depending on js for your actual app
[18:55:16] <aaronmcadam> that's always a bit dangerous
[18:55:22] <aaronmcadam> specially if it's auth?
[18:55:25] <RaviJK> subsequent requests from browser reach varnish, then JS on the page goes to CAS which is external sytem on RESt and does validation
[18:55:42] <RaviJK> yes, we did  abit of analysis
[18:55:45] <RaviJK> and are okay with it
[18:55:48] <aaronmcadam> if u ran that on node tho
[18:55:53] <aaronmcadam> that's a server side process
[18:55:54] <RaviJK> as it does not give then any specific function
[18:56:08] <RaviJK> all they get to see is, buy now buttons
[18:56:09] <aaronmcadam> right ok
[18:56:21] <aaronmcadam> so it's an ancillary feature?
[18:56:23] <ryanneufeld> wait, so every time a user does something there is an ajax call to your server?
[18:56:30] <RaviJK> if they are not registered it says login
[18:56:31] <RaviJK> yes
[18:56:34] <aaronmcadam> sounds like a lot of work for something ur not bothered about not working
[18:56:48] <ryanneufeld> I sure hope I don't have to use that site
[18:56:53] <RaviJK> :)
[18:56:58] <ryanneufeld> sounds slow....
[18:57:03] <RaviJK> its all prototype
[18:57:06] <aaronmcadam> can't you use server side sessions
[18:57:09] <RaviJK> we did a lot of metrics
[18:57:16] <RaviJK> and this was 200 times faster
[18:57:20] <RaviJK> than doing on server side
[18:57:29] <aaronmcadam> right...
[18:57:39] <aaronmcadam> but depending on js for something that *should* be server side
[18:57:44] <RaviJK> specially with Drupal, authenticated users are slow
[18:57:48] <aaronmcadam> i dunno... sounds dodgy
[18:57:59] <aaronmcadam> well change ur server stack then?
[18:58:17] <aaronmcadam> what about security?
[18:58:20] <ryanneufeld> is there an easy way to get the cursor position in a textarea?
[18:58:24] <aaronmcadam> anyone can see the ajax call that you make
[18:58:25] <RaviJK> security is not a problem
[18:58:40] <ryanneufeld> then why are you authenticating them?
[18:58:54] <RaviJK> when they click on buy now buttons, they are taken to external system (Experian) which deals with security and payment process
[18:59:00] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: .select() i *think* or focus
[18:59:28] <aaronmcadam> so what are u pushing to the external system
[18:59:30] <aaronmcadam> in the ajax?
[18:59:34] <RaviJK> we need to show them some personalized content. things like Hello X
[19:00:02] <RaviJK> "Buy now" instead of "Register"
[19:00:11] <RaviJK> "You can watch these vidoes" etc
[19:00:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah but that's silly
[19:00:17] <RaviJK> but they cannot do anything further
[19:00:27] <aaronmcadam> that;s just an auth check that should be in a session
[19:00:30] <RaviJK> as there is a third party system that takes care of actual streaming etc etc
[19:00:40] <RaviJK> cannod do sessions
[19:00:51] <RaviJK> as varnish will not cache pages with session cookies
[19:00:51] <aaronmcadam> man that's fucked up
[19:01:10] <aaronmcadam> you're using varnish to paper over ur arch
[19:01:29] <RaviJK> if you look at any CMS, these are challenges
[19:01:30] <aaronmcadam> in turn crippling your options
[19:01:48] <RaviJK> specially when we are looking at traffic which is like 8,000 requests per sec
[19:01:58] <aaronmcadam> sounds pretty stupid that varnish can't do that
[19:02:18] <RaviJK> none of reverse proxies do it
[19:02:27] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: Akamai does :)
[19:02:28] <aaronmcadam> also sounds like drupal can't handle it, or your load balancing is whacked
[19:02:33] <ryanneufeld> well, that's a CDN
[19:03:02] <aaronmcadam> what about nginx or haproxy?
[19:03:06] <RaviJK> either ways, the plan is to never reach Drupal
[19:03:23] <RaviJK> we don't want to hit Drupal once the page is published
[19:03:30] <ryanneufeld> any plan that prevents reaching drupal is one I support :p
[19:03:37] <aaronmcadam> haha good man
[19:03:49] <RaviJK> :)
[19:03:55] <aaronmcadam> are u dealing with some legacy code or something
[19:04:02] <RaviJK> Drupal does all the hard work, renders content and publishes
[19:04:10] <aaronmcadam> i mean if you're trying to avoid drupal cuz it's so shit then wtf
[19:04:18] <coldhead> i'm sorry i thought this was the jQuery channel
[19:04:23] <RaviJK> after that, we want to use JS to do some personalization, getting data from different sources and compiling the page
[19:04:27] <RaviJK> blocks on page
[19:04:32] <RaviJK> coldhead it is
[19:04:36] <aaronmcadam> right
[19:04:40] <RaviJK> what we are discussing is JS issues
[19:04:44] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: he's just trolling
[19:04:48] <RaviJK> and root cause bhind them
[19:04:50] <RaviJK> behind
[19:04:52] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: nevermind him
[19:05:11] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: $('textarea').get(0).selectionStart if no text is selected will give me what I want
[19:05:14] <ryanneufeld> :)
[19:05:29] <coldhead> how dare you, aaronmcadam
[19:05:30] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: and the reason for trying to avoid returning to drupal is what specifically?
[19:05:32] <RaviJK> aaronmcadam ryanneufeld trust me , we spent ages on this doing benchmarking with differnent systems etc
[19:05:43] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: did u try just triggering focus?
[19:05:49] <RaviJK> Drupal bootstrap is the very very heavy process
[19:06:00] <RaviJK> it just cannot handle the kind of loads we are looking at
[19:06:11] <aaronmcadam> so why bloody use it then :D
[19:06:16] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: my assumption is that there is focus, I want to know where in the text area the cursor currently is
[19:06:24] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[19:06:26] <aaronmcadam> shit
[19:06:27] <RaviJK> using other products meant, we will loose all the good things that Drupal provides, its easily the best CMS out t here
[19:06:42] <aaronmcadam> fuck i dunno dude
[19:06:50] <aaronmcadam> wha? are u mad?
[19:07:04] <aaronmcadam> ok don't wanna get into a big offshoot
[19:07:09] <RaviJK> no :)
[19:07:11] <Mn3m0NiC> any idea someone how is possible to do such "double" input? http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/89/forme.gif/
[19:07:15] <aaronmcadam> but ee is awesome
[19:07:18] <ryanneufeld> Drupal !== CMS
[19:07:20] <aaronmcadam> just pity it's on php
[19:07:33] <RaviJK> Drupal is awsome
[19:07:43] <RaviJK> some of the largest websites are moving to Drupal  now
[19:07:56] <aaronmcadam> heheee
[19:08:01] <ryanneufeld> we get 45million uniques
[19:08:03] <RaviJK> Twitter dev network, ebay devloper networks, sony etc .. anyways not here to drum drupal
[19:08:06] <RaviJK> need help with JS
[19:08:11] <ryanneufeld> and we're moving to Codeiginiter
[19:08:16] <aaronmcadam> yumyum
[19:08:26] <ryanneufeld> We got bought by CBS
[19:08:30] <ryanneufeld> they run on wordpress
[19:08:34] <ryanneufeld> Wordpress == CMS
[19:08:37] <ryanneufeld> Drupal !== CMS
[19:08:40] <RaviJK> so back to my problem
[19:08:47] <ryanneufeld> Drupal === framework
[19:08:49] <RaviJK> any help ?
[19:09:03] <kborchers> Drupal === makes your code a huge mess
[19:09:08] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: I already answered your question
[19:09:13] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: nested ajax is the wrong path
[19:09:22] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: you *can* do it
[19:09:29] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: but you should find a less shitty way
[19:09:37] <aaronmcadam> it's a rabbithole
[19:09:42] <RaviJK> ryanneufeld .. how ?
[19:09:52] <aaronmcadam> async
[19:10:01] <ryanneufeld> we just had huge discussion about how
[19:10:07] <ryanneufeld> where were you?
[19:10:09] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[19:10:18] <aaronmcadam> he was trying to explain the why
[19:10:33] <ryanneufeld> and we told him "how" was a bad way
[19:10:37] <RaviJK> ryanneufeld .got lost in arch discussion
[19:10:41] <aaronmcadam> huh
[19:10:46] <aaronmcadam> uhuh*
[19:11:01] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: basiacally, you're fucked. You have an arch that is in your way
[19:11:10] <aaronmcadam> bingo
[19:11:12] <ryanneufeld> and you either can't or refuse to change it
[19:11:30] <RaviJK> ryanneufeld , we have two options
[19:11:33] <ryanneufeld> you can make the code prettier
[19:11:38] <RaviJK> one find a solution to get it work on the edge
[19:11:52] <RaviJK> or change it bottom up
[19:12:01] <RaviJK> maybe use akamai instead of varnish could be work
[19:12:05] <aaronmcadam> some sort of view that can handle one request
[19:12:14] <ryanneufeld> we use akamai, and it lets cookies through
[19:12:25] <ryanneufeld> it's super configureable
[19:12:35] <RaviJK> either ways, the real problem is .. serving content on the edge
[19:12:44] <ryanneufeld> edge of what?
[19:12:48] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: they are the "world leaders" after all :D
[19:12:48] <ryanneufeld> edge use case?
[19:12:53] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: he means varnish
[19:13:08] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: edge of sanity?
[19:13:12] <aaronmcadam> just about
[19:13:15] <RaviJK> think of it in way that key part of page is served by Drupal .. some of the blocks are compiled by JS
[19:13:18] <aaronmcadam> the whole thing is fucked
[19:13:46] <RaviJK> because content comes from systems that is not Drupal
[19:13:56] <aaronmcadam> and with all your research
[19:14:02] <aaronmcadam> have u thought about accessibility at all?
[19:14:14] <RaviJK> don't need accessibility
[19:14:28] <ryanneufeld> so blind people aren't paying customers?
[19:14:28] <aaronmcadam> or how that content is indexed? or do u need it?
[19:14:37] <aaronmcadam> the law?
[19:14:47] <RaviJK> indexed by search engines ?
[19:15:05] <aaronmcadam> if you're getting your crazy thousands per sec, purely one of them has a visual impairment
[19:15:11] <aaronmcadam> surely*
[19:15:22] <ryanneufeld> indeed, 8000/s is a shit load of traffic
[19:15:28] <aaronmcadam> basically, you're trying to use js as one big hug fuckin hack
[19:15:32] <ryanneufeld> ACTUALLY
[19:15:35] <ryanneufeld> Tripple that
[19:15:53] <ryanneufeld> you're taking 8000/s and making it 24000/s the way you want to handle this
[19:16:06] <ryanneufeld> you're adding two additional round trips
[19:16:10] <aaronmcadam> shit you;re right!!!
[19:16:14] <RaviJK> yes
[19:16:15] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: fuck!
[19:16:15] <warrenparsons> What's an extra 16k requests between friends?
[19:16:24] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: I even have the shirt ;)
[19:16:25] <RaviJK> but the round trips don't go to same servers
[19:16:59] <RaviJK> couple of varnish servers will serve 8K pages per sec quite easily
[19:17:05] <RaviJK> we can add another if required..
[19:17:12] <aaronmcadam> ok so what you want to do RaviJK, is chain two deferreds together
[19:17:13] <ryanneufeld> and one node server can handle 700k easily
[19:17:30] <aaronmcadam> one ajax request that depends on another
[19:17:35] <RaviJK> JASIG-CAS wit memcache can handle 8K auth easily
[19:17:43] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: that's how you could chain ajax requests
[19:17:43] <RaviJK> we do have a node.js in there..
[19:17:56] <aaronmcadam> why aren't u using it?
[19:18:01] <RaviJK> but i don't fully know what it does
[19:18:09] <aaronmcadam> oh god haha :D
[19:18:16] <RaviJK> maybe i need to find out
[19:18:20] <aaronmcadam> it's gonna handle your problem way better than client side js
[19:18:23] <aaronmcadam> u sure do
[19:18:26] <RaviJK> we are doing a mad mad project
[19:18:43] <RaviJK> large team with many many components
[19:18:48] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: but look up deferreds
[19:19:04] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: #node.js
[19:19:06] <RaviJK> aaronmcadam , node.js + deferreds
[19:19:18] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: nope
[19:19:50] <aaronmcadam> RaviJK: jquery deferreds on the front end but you *Don't* want to do it that way
[19:20:14] <aaronmcadam> node shits this sorta shit out easily
[19:20:24] <aaronmcadam> right i gtg to bed fuck's sake
[19:20:55] <RaviJK> will look up further .. thanks for your time
[19:20:59] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[19:21:14] <aaronmcadam> night guys
[19:21:23] <Ezek2k4> crap the json_encode in php doesnt works with jquery :( parse
[19:21:34] <Ezek2k4> any idea of a simple solution
[19:21:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah it does, if it's producing decent json
[19:23:23] <Ezek2k4> i have some ""username 's" and it doesnt works for some reason
[19:24:06] <kborchers> ?doesn't work @ Ezek2k4
[19:24:06] <bot-t> Ezek2k4, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[19:24:10] <Ezek2k4> i tried to validate it with a json validator and it give me errors where i have "

[19:49:15] <Iarfen> Hi
[19:50:21] <Iarfen> I have a strange error with jQuery: When I use the $.get function I get the html source code of the actual page instead of the data that should be received from the file, what can be the cause of this error?
[20:00:16] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I'm trying to use images as backgrounds instead of cropping them, Here is my attempt, It works everywhere except IE9,

[20:04:37] <ryanneufeld> ?tell Iarfen you might have a problem on your server side, chances are you're hitting the wrong url
[20:04:37] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[20:05:01] <ryanneufeld> ?g IE9 background position @ Nicolas_Leonida2

[20:08:34] <Nicolas_Leonida2> ryanseddon: I've seen that it says it's supported in IE9
[20:13:16] <Nicolas_Leonida2> does jsfiddle turn on some kind of compatibility mode?

[20:23:45] <cratos> Everyone, I implemented a wizard-based flow using the JQuery Wizard plugin and it works just fine. I'm want to send some data to a PHP for backend processing -- i'm stuck at a very basic problem. I've used jQuery variables to store context data - and the wizard is built dynamically
[20:23:53] <cratos> What is the best way to transfer the data to the PHP?
[20:25:12] <SerpentX> hey cratos
[20:25:22] <cratos> Hello SerpentX
[20:25:25] <SerpentX> u know how to pull a website and stuff it into a jquery ui dialog box
[20:25:34] <SerpentX> webpage*
[20:25:41] <SerpentX> with get
[20:25:48] <buhman> what is google doing to accomplish https://www.google.com/search?q=do+a+barrel+roll?
[20:26:49] <cratos> SerpentX, why don't you GET the page and then store it into the appropriate UI elelent?
[20:53:14] <SerpentX> god i just can't figure this shit out
[20:53:40] <SerpentX> like i don' even know what to look up to read
[20:54:25] <labratt> whats the prob
[21:13:10] <abjorn> cold
[21:13:11] <abjorn> head
[21:13:12] <abjorn> coldhead
[21:13:13] <abjorn> coldbro
[21:13:15] <abjorn> bro of cold
[21:13:16] <abjorn> head of cold
[21:13:18] <abjorn> headcold
[21:13:19] <abjorn> brocold
[21:15:34] <coldhead> wtf
[21:16:34] <abjorn> coldhead: its been a long day
[21:17:29] <ryanneufeld> headcold
[21:17:31] <ryanneufeld> I like it
[21:18:45] <coldhead> i'm calling my lawyers
[21:24:32] <coldhead> why did portishead keep making albums
[21:31:30] <ekkis> can anyone tell me how to set the height of my tabs when using the jQuery-UI tab system?
[21:31:45] <ekkis> it automatically resizes and I don't want it to
[21:32:02] <b0x> css?
[21:32:12] <coldhead> i'm gonna go with CSS too
[21:32:17] <coldhead> ?hi5 b0x
[21:32:18] <deahdloc> coldhead: have you lawers call mine
[21:32:18] <bot-t> âµ b0x
[21:32:26] <b0x> o/
[21:32:26] <ekkis> b0x: well... no.  whatever I set gets reset when the tabs get generated
[21:32:34] <coldhead> deahdloc: email okay?
[21:32:36] <deahdloc> ekkis: edit the css file that comes with it
[21:32:39] <ekkis> so that the tab height is specific to the content of the tab
[21:33:01] <deahdloc> coldhead: no, i insist on carier pigeon
[21:33:16] <deahdloc> ekkis: that's just silly
[21:33:40] <deahdloc> ekkis: you could also just add a unique class for each tab
[21:33:42] <ekkis> deahdloc: it's annoying
[21:33:54] <deahdloc> and make sure that it's in the css file AFTER the jquery-ui settings
[21:34:43] <ekkis> deahdloc: I don't think editing the css file is going to help as this is behaviour driven
[21:34:55] <ekkis> i.e. the library dynamically changes the height
[21:36:07] <abjorn> pidgin shows coldhead and deahdloc as the same color, its confusing me :(
[21:36:21] <deahdloc> lol
[21:36:35] <abjorn> I have yet to figure how how pidgin calculates username colors
[21:36:46] <deahdloc> abjorn: I think it's cyclic
[21:36:49] <abjorn> like has something to do with what letters are in the name, and how many
[21:36:57] <abjorn> but its the same no matter what
[21:37:05] <deahdloc> interesting
[21:37:05] <coldhead> i'll just shutup until this bozo goes away
[21:37:12] <coldhead> so you won't be confused
[21:37:16] <ryanneufeld> better?
[21:37:21] <coldhead> sup ryan
[21:37:22] <abjorn> yeah should just do that anyways coldhead
[21:37:26] <ryanneufeld> lol
[21:37:29] <coldhead> too true, abjorn
[21:37:29] <abjorn> <3
[21:37:43] <coldhead> you sound like my wife/boss/neglected child
[21:38:08] <abjorn> maybe if he/she/it/THING wasn't neglected
[21:38:11] <abjorn> it wouldn't say such things
[21:38:32] <abjorn> well, it's your offspring so I can only assume it's gender is swamp thing
[21:38:45] <coldhead> its*
[21:38:57] <abjorn> I know shut up god
[21:39:09] <ekkis> scheisse.  I'm going to need to debug the -ui.  means get the non-min
[21:39:35] <coldhead> can't you just throw some !importants around?
[21:39:39] <coldhead> that's what the pros do
[21:39:47] <coldhead> !important all the things
[21:39:49] <abjorn> coldhead: I keep trying to help them with javascripts at work, devs no let me :( they're all so very very bad at it, they keep breaking our support chat
[21:40:03] <abjorn> but when I say I'm good at javascript noooo one believes meee
[21:40:07] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: or they're doing to piss u off
[21:40:08] <ryanneufeld> lol
[21:40:18] <abjorn> no they're just fucking idiots
[21:40:28] <abjorn> they don't even properly test before going to products
[21:40:28] <coldhead> let me fax them, abjorn
[21:40:30] <abjorn> *production
[21:40:44] <abjorn> so they put out a release to production and it's all fucking broken
[21:40:57] <coldhead> i'll send them this in crayon: "LISTEN TO THIS DUDE ABJORN: HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT"
[21:41:03] <abjorn> ratings don't work, messages getting repeatedly, people getting disconnected all the time
[21:41:06] <abjorn> and so what do they do
[21:41:10] <coldhead> and they'll know it's from bill&teds
[21:41:13] <abjorn> they leave it like that for 2 weeks while they try and fix it
[21:41:13] <coldhead> and obey you
[21:41:27] <abjorn> so customers keep having to use the broken system
[21:41:36] <abjorn> even though the bug fixes it was fixing were less than the ones they created
[21:41:46] <abjorn> it's like they don't know how to fucking write produce software
[21:41:53] <abjorn> write produce?
[21:41:59] <abjorn> whatever
[21:42:04] <abjorn> my devs make me mad
[21:42:27] <coldhead> all devs suck
[21:42:34] <coldhead> most sysadmins are shitheads
[21:42:35] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: fuck you, I'm awesome
[21:42:39] <coldhead> someone told me that in the 90s
[21:42:44] <coldhead> it's truer than ever
[21:42:48] <abjorn> our sysadmins are good
[21:42:56] <coldhead> YOU WOULD SIDE WITH THEM
[21:42:57] <abjorn> and they're mostly all cool people
[21:43:16] <abjorn> we have 2 competent devs, and one of them is a blind perl programmer
[21:43:25] <coldhead> awesome
[21:43:30] <botfather>  wauw ;]
[21:44:11] <scar2> which option in the examples ensures the accordion does NOT ever produce a scrollbar?
[21:51:22] <ryanneufeld> if I have an element returned by .get(), how can get the html for that as a string? would I just wrap it and .html()?
[21:51:47] <ryanneufeld> $('div').find('img').get(0) for example
[21:52:06] <wookiehangover> ?mdc tostring
[21:52:31] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: that doesn't do it
[21:52:44] <ryanneufeld> I get [Object #HTMLelementsomeshit]
[21:52:48] <wookiehangover> ugh
[21:52:51] <wookiehangover> its late
[21:52:55] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[21:52:58] <ryanneufeld> I tried that :p
[21:53:03] <ryanneufeld> hence why I'm asking here :p
[21:53:14] <ryanneufeld> I need to pass it in to TinyMCE so it will add it properly
[21:54:06] <wookiehangover> outerHTML
[21:54:20] <wookiehangover> $('body').get()[0].outerHTML
[21:55:06] <wookiehangover> FYI just run console.dir( $('body').get()[0] ) to see all of the methods on an object
[21:55:33] <wookiehangover> omfg
[21:55:41] <ryanneufeld> outerHTML' of object #<HTMLImageElement> is not a function
[21:55:58] <wookiehangover> duh $('body').html()
[21:56:00] <ryanneufeld> ah
[21:56:11] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: that won't work the way I want
[21:56:15] <wookiehangover> wat
[21:56:21] <ryanneufeld> there is no innerHTML of an img tag
[21:56:22] <ryanneufeld> :P
[21:56:42] <wookiehangover> hold on, you want this for an image tag
[21:56:46] <ryanneufeld> .outerHTML worked when I didn't call it as a function
[21:56:55] <ryanneufeld> .find('img').get(0).outerHTML;
[21:57:01] <ryanneufeld> works
[21:58:02] <wookiehangover> ya its a prop
[21:58:15] <ryanneufeld> thx wookiehangover
[21:58:33] <wookiehangover> $('div').find('img').prop('outerHTML')
[21:58:37] <wookiehangover> BOOM
[21:59:27] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[21:59:28] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[21:59:44] <wookiehangover> exact
[22:13:29] <scar2> how can i have the accordion auto switch items
[22:13:33] <scar2> on a timer
[22:14:54] <ryanneufeld> thx again wookiehangover, I'm off for the night
[22:14:59] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: <3 later
[22:31:07] <nospinzy> $name = ($_GET['name']) ? $_GET['name'] : $_POST['name'];
[22:31:13] <nospinzy> what does the ? and : stand for
[22:31:28] <nospinzy> i know its php just wondering what those items are called
[22:31:48] <context> no. JS has it also probably
[22:31:56] <Eviltwin> JS has it
[22:32:00] <context> ?: is ternary operator
[22:32:01] <bot-t> context, JQuery Core Style Guidelines - Strict equality checks ( === ) should be used in favor of == wherever possible. http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[22:32:07] <wookiehangover> yes
[22:32:09] <context> (if blah blah) ? (then) : (else)
[22:32:23] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation
[22:32:50] <nospinzy> thanks
[22:33:23] <nospinzy> how didnt i know about this!
[22:34:09] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:
[22:34:50] <nospinzy> lol
[22:39:36] <clir-in> hi
[22:39:45] <clir-in> i need help http://jsfiddle.net/VMSpS/
[22:40:56] <context> heh
[22:41:13] <clir-in> first you need to click the yellow box then the flight list will display
[22:41:26] <clir-in> the list is dragable to the yellow box
[22:42:16] <clir-in> once there is selected flight you can drag now the yellow box. dragging it outside the box. should remove the selected flight
[22:42:50] <clir-in> but after removing the div. its not clickable anymore
[22:42:57] <clir-in> can you me please
[22:44:15] <sente> mylist.filter(function(elem){if(elem) return true;})  // is this the ideal way to remove empty strings and null values form a list?
[22:44:37] <sente> not jquery releated
[22:44:46] <sente> *related
[22:44:48] <context> clir-in: you are removing #selected_flight, than appending a new one
[22:44:56] <clir-in> yes
[22:45:01] <context> clir-in: this new #selected_flight is neither draggable nor droppable.
[22:45:28] <clir-in> should be like the old #selected_flight
[22:45:29] <clir-in> same function
[22:45:30] <context> you need to add the click/droppable/watever calls to this new element.
[22:45:44] <context> but its not THE same element
[22:45:45] <clir-in> how?
[22:45:47] <context> the events/triggers are attached to the element
[22:46:02] <context> if you put gas in your car and buy a new car your gas doesn't magically go to your new car
[22:46:51] <clir-in> how will i put the events/triggers to the new one?
[22:46:58] <context> the same way you did the old one ?
[22:47:23] <clir-in> sorry context. i really have no idea how i do that
[22:47:44] <context> you did $('blah').draggable(...) from what i see
[22:47:50] <clir-in> yes
[22:47:53] <context> yes.
[22:47:59] <context> so you need to do this to the new element...
[22:48:16] <context> $().draggable() puts gas in the car
[22:48:33] <context> .append() is putting a new car in the garage (container)
[22:48:37] <context> no gas in said car
[22:49:22] <clir-in> hmm
[22:50:16] <bobsomebody> http://pastebin.com/aQ3qQzAx having a little js trouble with replace(), pattern test is good
[22:50:20] <clir-in> context.. i really dont know how i will do it.
[22:50:30] <context> clir-in: one sec
[22:52:39] <Eviltwin> bobsomebody: Works just fine here
[22:52:49] <Eviltwin> Keep in mind that replace doesn't modify the original string
[22:52:55] <Eviltwin> But returns a modified version of the string
[22:53:03] <Eviltwin> You likely want href=href.replace(patt,'-350x350.');
[22:53:06] <bobsomebody> yeah it just dawned on me
[22:53:29] <bobsomebody> i was trying to fully facepalm myself and you beat me to the punch
[22:53:43] <context> clir-in: http://jsfiddle.net/VMSpS/1/
[22:54:04] <context> err wait
[22:54:17] <clir-in> ok
[22:54:35] <context> clir-in: http://jsfiddle.net/VMSpS/2/
[22:54:37] <context> there thats better
[22:54:49] <context> jsfiddle needs line numbers, and auto-indent
[22:55:32] <context> oh... its got the tidyup button
[22:56:15] <context> clir-in: moving all modifications to a function, then call said function when new item is put there
[22:57:18] <clir-in> that was fast. :) tnx context
[22:57:35] <clir-in> i now i know how to do it.. tnx
[22:58:54] <clir-in> i mean. now i know.. tnx again
[23:29:06] <SerpentX> somebody shoot me
[23:38:04] <cook1es> Hihi, with my selector --- $('  body > table > tbody > tr > td > table:nth-child(3)   '); --- I am getting this: http://localhostr.com/files/EjBs3Yd/capture.png from this debug: http://localhostr.com/files/4tEEwUm/capture.png any ideas?
[23:39:12] <Cork> cook1es: create a test page instead
[23:39:16] <Cork> ?p @ cook1es
[23:39:16] <bot-t> cook1es, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:48:35] <yuwang> --help
[23:50:48] <cook1es> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/JRU9v/ works fine. :/
[23:52:08] <Cork> cook1es: run your page through a validator, might be the answer
[23:52:27] <cook1es> Cork: I should also say that it works in Firebug console.
[23:52:41] <cook1es> On the page where I am running the script
[23:52:50] <coldhead> BLIND PEOPLE RULE
[23:52:55] <Cork> your running the script direct in the header?
[23:53:13] <Cork> what i mean, you might run it before the dom is ready
[23:53:36] <cook1es> It's a greasemonkey script so I guess no. Nah I don't think I run it before DOM is ready because it returns the 5 first values right
[23:53:52] <cook1es> seen in http://localhostr.com/files/EjBs3Yd/capture.png
[23:53:57] <Cork> that doesn't mean the entire dom is ready
[23:54:23] <Cork> cook1es: images is pointless
[23:54:24] <cook1es> I also run it inside .ready() =P sorry
[23:56:36] <cook1es> It feels like it's something with nth-child, is there another method to get the child within a selector? I know about .children() but that's quite a circuit
[23:58:29] <cook1es> coldhead: any ideas? :)
