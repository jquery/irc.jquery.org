[00:00:07] <Cork> noaXess: you can append strings to dom but not the other way around
[00:01:30] <noregret> Cork: can it be converted to a string? is there a jquery function for that
[00:01:32] <noaXess> Cork: ok.. thanks. but.. why? hehe.. thing you answered to the wrong guy..
[00:02:19] <noaXess> noregret: what s in your DOM
[00:02:30] <noaXess> or is dom just a variable?
[00:03:08] <noregret> noaXess: it's a var
[00:04:25] <noaXess> noregret: what is $(x), or what is behind x? any field id?
[00:04:58] <tw2113> oh behave Cork http://jakiestfu.github.com/Behave.js/
[00:05:14] <foo> Cork: just shot you a PM, sorry, if not, no problem. Figured I'd ask just in case. I guess i could just share the URL publicly too
[00:05:22] <noregret> noaXess: x is an img element
[00:06:54] <noaXess> noregret: so dome is your image element and you can do something like: dom.css("display", "none")... but why you want convert your image element into a string?
[00:07:23] <foo> I'm going on 16 hours today and I cannot figure out why you have to click submit twice on this page. /me screams
[00:08:05] <noregret> noaXess: check this http://pastie.org/5853892 on lines 11-12..
[00:08:47] <noregret> noaXess: i'm not getting what's expected on lines 11-12
[00:08:59] <noregret> noaXess: instead im getting what's commented
[00:09:00] <noaXess> noregret: gimme a second
[00:16:04] <foo> $("#gform_submit_button_1").click(check_blank_fields(event.target.id)); - if I call a handler like that, does the event object get passed as the second arg? Doesn't seem to.
[00:16:20] <foo> or, do event handler's typically not have args passed like I'm doing?
[00:16:28] <xec> the latter
[00:16:45] <foo> interesting
[00:17:01] <xec> you can do .click(function(e) { check_blank_fields(e.target.id) }) though
[00:17:29] <foo> xec: thanks, I tried that, no bueno. Have a minute to take a look at a page? You have to click submit twice for it to work, can't figure out why
[00:18:01] <xec> if you're listening for a form submit you should try .submit() instead of .click()
[00:18:08] <xec> (on the form)
[00:18:17] <foo> xec: interesting, I'll try that.
[00:18:35] * foo tries $(e.srcElement).submit()
[00:19:10] <foo> xec: gah, nope.
[00:20:57] <xec> i meant .submit(handler) - as a listener
[00:21:45] <foo> xec: code looks like this: http://screencast.com/t/0HFLJ6Du , gets called like this on click: submit_gravity_form(e); , first iteration through function, it saves some data, at the end of that, it should initiate click again to ...
[00:21:50] <foo> wait one darn minute.
[00:21:54] * foo checks something
[00:23:58] * foo sighs
[00:24:00] <foo> nevermind
[00:27:15] <foo>                    $(gravity_form_event.srcElement).submit(function() { submit_gravity_form(gravity_form_event) });
[00:27:21] <foo> xec: for some reason, that isn't working.
[00:27:29] <foo> submit() or click() - what would cause that not to work?
[00:33:01] <foo> xec: why did you suggest submit() over click() ?
[00:34:29] <noregret> isn't there some global event I can use to apply anything to dynamically added content? because currenty, i have to re-run e.g. $('.whatever').datepicker() or any other other method right after the content is added and in .ready()
[00:35:26] <xec> foo: as i understood it, you are trying to listen to a form submit? by attaching a click handler to the submit button?
[00:35:40] <foo> xec: may I link you to a URL?
[00:35:44] <xec> sure
[00:39:25] <foo> xec: http://www.aeri.com.php53-12.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/request-quote/?addToQuote=1603827 - scroll down and click SUBMIT RFQ. Notice you have to click it twice. In the markup, ctrl+f for $("#gform_submit_button_1").click(function(e) { check_blank_fields(event.target.id,e) }); - that's the function that gets called (I added a wrapper to check the fields, I'm not original dev). Upon no errors, this gets run: if (id == 'gform_submit_button_1') { ...
[00:39:31] <foo> ... submit_gravity_form(e); }; You'll see inside submit_gravity_form(), it should save some data the first run through, then at the end of submit_gravity_form() it submits the form again with click() and then it should submit the form.
[00:39:53] <foo> xec: I have been working on this for around 3 hours now, and am going on working 17 hours today... I really should go to sleep, but I really want to get this knocked out. I appreciate any help.
[00:40:38] <xec> foo: i get a "missing quantity" error when clicking the submit button
[00:40:46] <xec> (on first click)
[00:41:14] <foo> xec: my mistake, add QTY - I forgot to mention that.
[00:41:23] <foo> up on top row where text input type is
[00:41:34] <foo> that's check_blank_fields() validating the form
[00:42:39] <xec> in that code you just pasted in the channel, you do function(e) and then refer to 'event'
[00:42:59] <xec> maybe it's supposed to be e.target.id ?
[00:44:07] <foo> xec: I don't believe so, no, that's so we can figure out which form it is. (another dev added that)
[00:45:04] <xec> how sure are you about that :P
[00:45:22] <xec> if so, where is 'event' defined?
[00:45:32] <foo> hmm, /me adds an alert to check for that
[00:45:37] <foo> I'm pretty sure that's what this other guy did
[00:45:47] * foo nudges him to see if he's still around, gah 3 devs on this
[00:46:39] <nesoi> hm... so anyone here use jquery-mobile?
[00:47:34] <foo> xec: yeah, that's good, just added alert() - that helps us determine the form
[00:48:55] <xec> event is a global in some browsers, which are you using?
[00:49:26] <foo> xec: chrome
[00:49:43] <foo> xec: interesting, I didn't realize that.
[00:49:46] <foo> I could manually specify it
[00:49:57] <foo> although, I don't think that's affecting the submit twice issue
[00:50:58] <xec> probably not - i would still fix it though
[00:51:08] <relipse> anyone want to talk about the bible? colossians 2?
[00:51:29] <foo> xec: good idea, thanks. /me does
[00:51:52] <xec> ?ask @ nesoi
[00:51:53] <bot-t> nesoi, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:53:17] <foo> xec: fixed, thanks. any thoughts on this submit twice issue? darn strange.
[00:54:06] <nVee> hey guys, can someone perhaps help me on how I would set a selector to a div which has a rel property? I tried $("div[rel='rel_name']") but no luck
[00:54:26] <xec> haven't realy found the flow of logic - a lot of code to just jump into
[00:54:27] <foo> nVee: try $("div[rel=rel_name]")
[00:54:38] <nesoi> thanks xec. I am new to jquery and jqm and I am wondering how easy or difficult it would be to change the arrow on the right in a listview to be a checkbox so that multiple rows could be selected
[00:55:29] <nesoi> or make it so that if you click on a row, it becomes selected and changes color, etc., then the selected rows are passed back when a submit button for the page is clicked
[00:55:53] <xec> nesoi: i have never used jqmobile, sorry - if you don't direct the question to me, there's probably better chance someone else will see it
[00:56:11] <noaXess> noregret: sorry... but have you solved?
[00:56:16] <foo> xec: this was original code: http://screencast.com/t/OYyvRmX5SEE - when you clicked on that submit button, it would run function once to save data, then run it again... but it's like the way it currently is, it can't submit it again. very weird.
[00:57:17] <nesoi> I am new to jquery and jqm and I am wondering how easy or difficult it would be to change the arrow on the right in a listview to be a checkbox so that multiple rows could be selected or make it so that if you click on a row, it becomes selected and changes color, etc., then the selected rows are passed back when a submit button for the page is clicked
[00:57:34] <noaXess> noregret: how does aimg really look?
[00:57:34] <xec> foo: aha, i get it
[00:57:57] <foo> xec: yeah, that was original code, but I'm not sure how mine broke it
[00:58:04] <noregret> noaXess: yep, solved it in another way
[00:58:06] <xec> foo: the gravity_form_ready var, when false, will prevent submission (the preventDefault() call)
[00:58:17] <noaXess> noregret: :) fine
[00:58:25] <djQuery> noregret, user thats on here some named GNARF had a little plugin that would do this.
[00:58:47] <xec> foo: right?
[00:58:52] <djQuery> tried hunting it down but it was stored in a ghist
[00:59:04] <noregret> djQuery: waht ?
[00:59:14] <foo> xec: yes, so after data gets saved first time function gets called, it click()'s it at the end, calls function again, but the second time the form gets submitted since for isn't prevented
[00:59:32] <noregret> djQuery: do what exactly ?
[01:00:39] <xec> foo: so the ajax is not for posting data, just checking for validity?
[01:01:12] <foo> xec: what ajax are you referring to?
[01:01:20] <xec> the $.get()
[01:01:23] <djQuery> noregret, https://gist.github.com/1003630
[01:01:59] <djQuery> you were askin for something that would monitor element creates so that you could apply the datepicker etc to them right?
[01:02:06] <foo> xec: that part is where the data does get saved
[01:04:23] <noregret> djQuery: ah right, this looks nice, thanks!
[01:04:46] <zulu-gula> why this does not work http://jsfiddle.net/6H8KE/1/ ? I would like to hide optgroup depend on what string s is
[01:04:56] <djQuery> noregret, now if its just datepicker
[01:06:52] <sacrilicious> good morning, i have my code like this: $('#superdiv').show()
[01:06:53] <djQuery> $(document).on('focus', 'input:[type="datetime-local"]', function(){ $(this).datepicker();  });
[01:07:02] <djQuery> off the top my head
[01:07:04] <sacrilicious> however, i want to delay  the div from showing immediately
[01:07:15] <noregret> djQuery: not really, several other stuff :)
[01:07:15] <relipse> sacrilicious: google
[01:07:17] <sacrilicious> i want to delay it by say 3 seconds, after mouse hover
[01:07:51] <sacrilicious> relipse: if i am here, its because i did not find the answer on google, dumbo
[01:07:53] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy   delay tooltip display on hover
[01:07:55] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=delay+tooltip+display+on+hover
[01:08:12] <sacrilicious> djQuery: its not a tooltip, its a div
[01:08:42] <xec> foo: this is really confusing code, why would you re-trigger the click handler instead of just trigger submit on the form
[01:09:04] <djQuery> sacrilicious, and you cant extrapolate showing the div from the example given there?
[01:09:06] <foo> xec: so, use submit instead - I can try that.
[01:10:04] <sacrilicious> i tried $('#superdiv').show().delay(9000), but i do not see the 9 seconds delay...
[01:10:15] <foo> xec: didn't seem to work (I did already try this per your first request). I wonder if there is something wrong with this: $(gravity_form_event.srcElement).submit(submit_gravity_form);
[01:10:29] <foo> xec: actually, I guess I don't need to use that handler
[01:10:49] <djQuery> sacrilicious, there is also ?hoverIntent
[01:11:15] <foo> xec: $("#gform_submit_button_1").submit(); doesn't seem to work either
[01:11:34] <xec> foo: yeah you need to call .submit() on the form element, see ?submit
[01:11:36] <bot-t> foo, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[01:12:11] <foo> xec: gotcha, so $("#gform_submit_button_1").submit(); should work I believe
[01:12:12] * foo checks
[01:12:31] <noregret> djQuery: too bad, didn't work out in the future :/
[01:12:32] <foo> xec: oh...
[01:12:38] <foo> xec: id of form. /me checks
[01:12:49] <djQuery> noregret, ?
[01:12:50] <xec> no, the form is #gform_1
[01:13:07] <foo> xec: right, so I need to use that
[01:13:14] <foo> unless I read this wrong
[01:13:16] * foo checks again
[01:13:32] <relipse> anyone want to talk about the bible? colossians 2?
[01:13:37] <noregret> djQuery: that plugin i mean
[01:14:05] <foo> relipse: that's not appropriate here.
[01:14:49] <_sCoRpi> hi guys
[01:14:59] <_sCoRpi> any way to get rid of the double click event fired when clicking on a label?
[01:15:27] <relipse> i'm just asking
[01:15:33] <foo> xec: looks like submit() worked, but now data isn't being saved
[01:15:34] <foo> hmm
[01:15:36] * foo checks
[01:15:58] <xec> relipse: "just asking" if people want to talk about the bible in here is still very inappropriate
[01:16:22] <_sCoRpi> solved my issue
[01:20:08] <BadCodSmell> When doing $('<script type="text/javascript">console.log('hi');</script>'); is there a way to execute the script or access it before appending to the dom?
[01:21:14] <foo> xec: sigh, I'm about to give up. submit() worked, but now the data is not getting saved. I don't get how changing and adding submit() breaks data from getting saved.
[01:25:11] <xec> foo: are there multiple click handlers perhaps?

[01:25:17] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[01:25:35] <djQuery> ?hoverintent@sacrilicious
[01:25:37] <bot-t> sacrilicious, hoverIntent - jQuery Plugins - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[01:26:01] <BadCodSmell> or does it just do $('script').each(exec($(v).remove().text());});?
[01:26:22] <BadCodSmell> $('script', tobeinserted) I mean
[01:26:45] * djQuery thought it read Bad CODE smell
[01:26:45] <seutje> ?exec
[01:26:46] <bot-t> seutje: Syntax: ? exec <javascript code>
[01:27:03] <seutje> ?mdn exec
[01:27:04] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "mdn exec" in jQuery Docs.
[01:27:16] <seutje> SCREW YOU BOT-T
[01:27:18] <foo> xec: nope, just one
[01:27:18] <xec> ?g mdn exec
[01:27:20] <bot-t> xec, exec - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec

[01:27:27] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[01:27:30] <BadCodSmell> eval
[01:27:35] <foo> xec: well, for this submit button, anyway
[01:27:41] <seutje> yeah, that's what I thought
[01:28:02] <djQuery> BadCodSmell, you cant eval it the way that you appened it with a script tag
[01:28:12] <seutje> BadCodSmell: what's this exec function ur using?
[01:28:30] <xec> and - does it return a function intended for the each call?
[01:28:40] <BadCodSmell> jquery executes js when you insert into the dom
[01:28:48] <seutje> WAT?
[01:28:49] <BadCodSmell> I would like to know if there is any way I can control that
[01:29:17] <djQuery> noregret, got example
[01:29:34] <foo> xec: why does it need to return something, can I just call the function? eg. it's this: $("#gform_submit_button_1").click(function(e) { check_blank_fields('gform_submit_button_1',e) });
[01:29:48] <BadCodSmell> yes jquery has something like function append(dom){$('script', dom).each(eval($(v).remove().text());});this.reallyAppend(dom);}
[01:30:13] <BadCodSmell> where dom might be var dom = $('<script type="text/javascript">console.log("hi");</script>');
[01:30:24] <BadCodSmell> except $('script', dom) returns nothing.
[01:30:35] <mattyh88> hey, i'd like to add another div after the closing tag of the given div with this code, but the text that's being added is added directly after the <div> opening tag instead of the closing tag. What can I do? http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Eur/
[01:30:39] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: it only executes if you append directly to the DOM IIRC
[01:30:53] <seutje> BadCodSmell: cause it tries to find the script INSIDE the script
[01:31:00] <BadCodSmell> Yes, it seems that way, but I would like to know if I can control that
[01:31:13] <seutje> it would work if ur dom var was like '<script><script></script></script>'
[01:31:14] <gnarf> $(html).find('script').remove().end() ?
[01:31:17] <xec> foo: that message wasn't for you ;)
[01:31:32] <djQuery> hey gnarf we were just talkin bout u
[01:31:39] <foo> xec: ah
[01:31:47] <foo> xec: I think I got it, actually, /me is about to cry if this is true, ha
[01:31:54] <seutje> which actually doesn't work, I think, since script tags are block-level and auto-close iirc
[01:32:37] <djQuery> ?newContent
[01:32:38] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[01:32:49] <gnarf> its brokenish now
[01:32:52] <gnarf> i should rewrite that
[01:34:05] <ggherdov> Hi all. In this (utterly funny and very short) talk, https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat , the guy uses a Javascript REPL. He launch it from a terminal with the command "jsc". Do you know that REPL? where can one get it? (REPL: read-eval-print loop, it's a js console, so to speak)
[01:35:26] <mattyh88> got it, never mind :)
[01:35:29] <Cork> ggherdov: you get that from any of the console implementations, like v8 console or greasemonkey console
[01:35:54] <root4> Hey, I'd like to add another effect on this blog. Does anyone have any ideas? http://smapro.org/blog
[01:36:41] <ggherdov> Cork: sure, but I looked for something "stand alone", that would not require me to launch a browser.
[01:36:58] <Cork> ggherdov: thats not a browser
[01:37:09] <ggherdov> Cork: ah.
[01:37:24] <Cork> ggherdov: v8 is the javascript interpreter used by chrome, greasemonkey is the javascript interpreter used by mozilla
[01:37:34] <Cork> its not a browser
[01:37:48] <djQuery> isnt it used by node as well
[01:37:57] <Cork> both are
[01:38:00] <Cork> you can choose
[01:38:23] <djQuery> thought FF was using a new one
[01:38:45] <Cork> well if you want to be strict firefox uses many enterpreters
[01:38:59] <ggherdov> Cork: uhm... I see. Whenever I hear "greasemonkey" I think of https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ , which isn't what you're referring, I guess
[01:39:08] <Cork> it has greasmonkey, tracemonkey, jägermonkey and ionmonkey
[01:39:15] <ggherdov> Cork: you mean the FF engine
[01:39:25] <Cork> but they'r collectively called greasemonkey
[01:39:37] <Cork> ggherdov: ff js engine, theres other engins in a browser
[01:39:57] <ggherdov> Cork: sure, like Gecko is the rendering engine
[01:40:05] <Trisox> cork!   \o/
[01:40:07] <Cork> oh btw sunspider is what safari uses
[01:40:10] <Trisox> o//
[01:40:12] <Cork> not sure what opera uses actually
[01:40:14] <Cork> o/
[01:40:20] <Trisox> :D
[01:41:31] <_sCoRpi> ok i'm back with my question
[01:41:39] <_sCoRpi> if you click a label in ie
[01:41:45] <_sCoRpi> it fires twice
[01:41:59] <Trisox> :D
[01:42:13] <_sCoRpi> i now prevented that behavior by checking if the element actually is a label or not
[01:42:27] <Trisox> label input /label?   or label /label  input
[01:42:38] <_sCoRpi> label containing an input
[01:42:42] <_sCoRpi> as a checkbox replacement
[01:42:46] <Trisox> e.target ?
[01:42:57] <Trisox> ? e.target
[01:42:58] <bot-t> Trisox, event.target | jQuery API Documentation - The DOM element that initiated the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[01:43:03] <_sCoRpi> using that
[01:43:05] <Trisox> you mean that
[01:43:17] <_sCoRpi> what i got now is this
[01:43:19] <_sCoRpi> wait
[01:43:28] <Cork> _sCoRpi: one of the best way to solve that is to use the for attribut and have the label separated from the input element
[01:43:31] <Trisox> js fiddle of codepen it lzz
[01:43:45] <_sCoRpi> trisox: doing that
[01:43:55] <_sCoRpi> Cork: ok that's true
[01:43:57] <Cork> <label for="password">Password:</label><input name="password" id="password">
[01:44:00] <Trisox> Cork:  thats wy i asked the label input /label?   or label /label  input
[01:44:11] <Trisox> :>
[01:44:15] <_sCoRpi> Cork: let me quickly try that if it will solve the 2nd issue
[01:45:19] <_sCoRpi> nope
[01:45:23] <_sCoRpi> ok preparing fiddle
[01:45:36] <Cork> you would not get event bubbling problems with that
[01:46:33] <djQuery> _sCoRpi, wouldnt you just tell the click not to bubble?
[01:47:06] <_sCoRpi> djQuery: i need  the click on the label, not on the nested input
[01:47:12] <_sCoRpi> actually the nested input is even hidden
[01:47:59] <_sCoRpi> http://jsfiddle.net/nVw7w/
[01:47:59] <lobbin> Any ideas how to solve a "smart grid" on jQuery Mobile? I'd like to use css to have one or two columns based on screen width.
[01:48:45] <_sCoRpi> Trisox, Cork: check that fiddle. the actual problem isn't the double event firing anymore (kind of) but rather that in IE a double-click event will be fired if you click rapidly
[01:48:49] <_sCoRpi> i tried to stop it, but to no avail
[01:49:12] <_sCoRpi> i made the checkbox visible again so you can see what happens
[01:49:24] <_sCoRpi> the fake box will change, but it will become async with the real one
[01:49:37] <_sCoRpi> if you simply double click on the fake on
[01:49:38] <_sCoRpi> one
[01:49:51] <ggherdov> and this could be close: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino/Shell?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Rhino_Shell (mozilla rhino schell)
[01:49:54] <_sCoRpi> since it somehow registers the singleclick aswell
[01:51:06] <Trisox> wy not do <lable> </label> input?
[01:51:14] <Trisox> and use a for=""
[01:51:20] <_sCoRpi> Trisox: it doesn't make a different
[01:51:26] <Trisox> then on click label set checked
[01:51:32] <Trisox> or not checked
[01:51:40] <Trisox> does surently matter
[01:51:40] <_sCoRpi> the Double-click issue persists
[01:54:41] <Trisox> wy is jsfiddle so damn slow
[01:55:44] <_sCoRpi> i don't nkow
[01:55:49] <_sCoRpi> it's weird
[01:56:20] <Trisox> right
[01:56:37] <seba4> someone knows how to see what is wrong with the code.. i am trying to figure it out but...
[01:56:42] <seba4> this is the code
[01:56:42] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/4632771
[01:56:48] <_sCoRpi> Trisox: remember it was like this a few weeks ago
[01:56:52] <_sCoRpi> then it was fine, now again
[01:57:04] <seba4> the problem is in the last part ... update .... serialize
[01:57:16] <seba4> error Error: cannot call methods on sortable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'serialize'
[01:57:16] <seba4> [Break On This Error]

[01:57:47] <seba4> i suspect it is taking data from wrong div....

[02:01:25] <johanwallberg> hi. i'm using a scroll button to scroll down to elements on my page. i want to hide the button if scrolling _manually_ and show it if scrolling back to the top. how?
[02:01:25] <Cork> seba4: your sure serialize can handle dubble dashes?
[02:02:19] <Cork> johanwallberg: you would have to show what your talking about
[02:02:25] <Trisox> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/#docs
[02:02:36] <Trisox> something like that johanwallberg
[02:03:07] <Trisox> check examples
[02:04:11] <marcules> hi there
[02:04:16] <root4> hi
[02:06:39] <johanwallberg> looks great Trisox
[02:07:15] <johanwallberg> do you know if its possible to hide it when scrolling manually?
[02:10:04] <aishwarya> i want to check on page load, if a form has any value set
[02:11:38] <aishwarya> it should check only once, when the page is loaded
[02:11:55] <Cork> aishwarya: just select out the form field and check it
[02:12:08] <Cork> $('#input_field_id').val()
[02:12:47] <aishwarya> that works, but it checks everytime a value on the form is changed, which is not what i want
[02:13:00] <aishwarya> it should be checked only once, on page load
[02:13:17] <Cork> uh
[02:13:23] <Cork> no that check when you run that line
[02:13:48] <Cork> if you want to do it on load do it in document ready for example
[02:14:27] <Cork> $(function() { if($('#input_field_id').val() == 'value') { /* do something */ } });
[02:15:38] <aishwarya> yes, i have placed a code which checks if any input filed in the form has been changed in document ready function, but it fires everytime i change a value in the form
[02:15:47] <aishwarya> input field*
[02:15:51] <seba4> cork kinda solved it ... had to define where it reads data from ...  this is almost working:) $.post($("#sorted").data('update-url'), $("#sorted").sortable('serialize'))
[02:16:08] <Cork> aishwarya: then you've bound an event on the input field instead of doing that
[02:16:23] <Cork> something like $('#input_field_id').change(function() {})
[02:16:26] <seba4> but i have another question i am looking at jquery api   and this is writen ... but dont know what it means...
[02:16:33] <seba4> jQuery.post( url [, data ] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR) ] [, dataType ] )
[02:16:52] <seba4> why ... there is a comma inside ...before lets say data ...
[02:17:02] <Cork> cause the comma is conditional
[02:17:06] <Anticom> seba4 arguments in [] brackets are optional
[02:17:15] <Anticom> so you only have to use the comma when using that parameter
[02:17:20] <Cork> you don't have to write $.post(url, , function() {})
[02:17:31] <Anticom> so it's .post(url) OR .post(url, data) OR ...
[02:17:32] <Cork> data is conditional
[02:17:35] <Cork> including its comma
[02:17:58] <seba4> oh thx
[02:17:59] <Anticom> haha Cork high five on tag team explenation :D
[02:18:20] <seba4> i suspected but had to ask to be sure..
[02:18:35] <Anticom> it's a common syntax seba4
[02:18:55] <aishwarya> cork: http://pastie.org/5854204
[02:18:55] <seba4> havent seen it in other languages... but new in jquery
[02:19:03] <aishwarya> this is what i have done
[02:19:11] <Anticom> seba4 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/de/select.html
[02:19:13] <Anticom> e.g.
[02:19:16] <Cork> seba4: webstandards use it, command lines use it and so on
[02:19:36] <Anticom> it's kind of EBNF isn't it?!
[02:19:38] <seba4> havent noticed it:) but better later then never:)
[02:19:56] <Cork> aishwarya: ya, so you bind an event listener to #form :inputs, and when that event fire you show an alert
[02:20:11] <Cork> aishwarya: nothing is triggered on page load there
[02:20:55] <aishwarya> how do i trigger on page load? it should happen only once
[02:21:05] <Anticom> $(window).load()
[02:21:15] <Cork> if you want it to happen only once you shouldn't use the change listener at all
[02:21:32] <Cork> just select the input field you want to check and check the value
[02:21:39] <Cork> no need to use event
[02:21:49] <aishwarya> okay.. like there are many input fields in the form
[02:21:56] <Cork> so if($("#form :input").val() == 'something') {}
[02:22:06] <makin> Hi people, what is the best plugin for truncate text?
[02:22:13] <Cork> aishwarya: so you would have to check everyone of them if you want whats in them
[02:22:28] <Cork> makin: why not just let dom do it?
[02:22:50] <aishwarya> yes, i want to check if any input field in the form has been changed
[02:22:58] <makin> Cork, what you mean?
[02:22:59] <Cork> on load??
[02:23:24] <Cork> makin: put the text in an element and set a max size on the element
[02:23:25] <makin> do you know how to do it?
[02:23:53] <aishwarya> cork: yes
[02:24:19] <Cork> aishwarya: that makes no sense, the user can't have changed the content on load so there is no event to check
[02:24:50] <Cork> aishwarya: or do you mean you want to bind an event listener and only get it once and then remove the listener?
[02:24:50] <aishwarya> it happens when back is clicked
[02:25:11] <Cork> there is no change event on history change
[02:25:41] <Cork> you would have to store what "was" in the input fields
[02:25:52] <Cork> and on load loop over each input field and see if it differ
[02:26:03] <Cork> dom events can't help you
[02:26:10] <aishwarya> my form fields are persistent when back button is clicked, so i just want to submit the form if any fields have been changed
[02:26:30] <Cork> sure, but you have to keep track on if they have
[02:26:35] <Cork> there is no event
[02:26:46] <aishwarya> yes, that is what i want to achieve!
[02:26:54] <aishwarya> okay
[02:26:55] <Cork> uh...
[02:27:44] <Cork> makin: or is there a reason why you need to do the crop in js?
[02:28:23] <makin> Cork, I can crop with css, but css only allows to crop one line, not multiple line.. So.. I will do something like that: trim(title).substring(0, 10)     .split(" ").slice(0, -1).join(" ") + "...";
[02:28:33] <makin> Or.. what you suggest?
[02:28:47] <Cork> hmm
[02:29:42] <Cork> http://pvdspek.github.com/jquery.autoellipsis/ ?
[02:30:46] <Anticom2> makin sec i wrote a plugin sometime back
[02:30:54] <Anticom2> maybe i'll be able to find it again :D
[02:31:03] <makin> ok, Anticom2 :)
[02:31:10] <makin> Thanks Cork, I will take a look
[02:33:45] <Anticom2> makin sorry, seems like i've only got it on my home pc
[02:33:46] <Anticom2> :/
[02:33:50] <Cork> makin: there is -o-ellipsis-lastline and -webkit-line-clamp that works with pure css
[02:33:54] <Anticom2> but it's fairly simple
[02:33:56] <Cork> but only in those two browsers
[02:34:16] <makin> Cork.. mm interesting but I have lot of IE traffic ...
[02:34:35] <Anticom2> just get the whole text in one string and go from index 0 to whatever length you want to cut it... then go back till you find a white space and replace it with a NL
[02:34:42] <Cork> makin: you could use the js solution as a fallback if its not supported in css
[02:34:43] <Anticom2> repeat that process untill you're at the end of your string
[02:34:54] <Cork> but the plugin should really be able to solve it
[02:35:31] <makin> Cork, how I can use the plugin as a fallback? Counting the chars? Searching the "..." in the string?
[02:35:42] <makin> characters*
[02:35:49] <Cork> makin: set the css rules to do it
[02:36:02] <Cork> when the page loads to a feature sniffing for the css support
[02:36:12] <Cork> if its not there call the plugin
[02:36:57] <makin> ok thank i will try it
[02:40:43] <Cork> makin: something like like $(function() { var test = document.createElement('span'); if(test.style.webkitLineClamp !== undefined) { $.browser.support.lineClamp = true; }; test.style.textOverflow = '-o-ellipsis-lastline'; return test.style.textOverflow == '-o-ellipsis-lastline'; });
[02:40:48] <Cork> should get you going
[02:41:01] <Cork> opps shouldn't be using return
[02:41:07] <Cork> but i hope you get the point
[02:42:08] <xpe> Is there a way to asynchronously load an image and at the same time be able to handle responses where the server sends an xml file (in case of an error) instead of the image? I currently just set the src attribute of an img tag and call load(), but I am not able to handle a returning xml document this way.
[02:42:24] <makin> thanks!
[02:43:27] <Cork> makin: then when you want to call the plugin you can just wrapp it with if(!$.browser.support.lineClamp && $.browser.support.ellipsislastLine) or something like that
[02:43:44] <Cork> * if(!$.browser.support.lineClamp && !$.browser.support.ellipsislastLine) or something like that
[02:45:48] <makin> Cork, I'm getting this error: http://pastebin.com/FnPaX85f
[02:46:23] <Cork> you need to run the code i gave you at the beginning of the page
[02:46:28] <Cork> and its not for adding the css
[02:46:35] <Cork> do that in your css file
[02:46:46] <Cork> the checks is for using the fallback plugin
[02:46:54] <makin> in the css file I can add js?
[02:48:41] <scarlet_razor> im trying to modify css property with jquery
[02:48:49] <scarlet_razor> but not know where's the problem

[02:49:11] <scarlet_razor> thanks by the way
[02:50:16] <Cork> makin: http://pastebin.com/NWqhbD87
[02:50:19] <Cork> something like taht
[02:50:20] <greek> Hi fellas. I've got an event that's firing when I click on a link. Inside this event, I'm executing an Ajax call. For some reason, this Ajax call is getting executed multiple times. I've stuck an alert in the line directly above the Ajax call, but the alert on gets called once, despite the Ajax call firing 2, 3 sometimes up to 5 or 6 times What gives? Thanks.
[02:51:38] <makin> ah ok, Cork!
[02:52:09] <Cork> makin: remember though, that code is untested, so you might have to fix it for it to really work
[02:52:17] <Cork> but it shouldn't be too far from the target
[02:52:26] <makin> yes, i know, don't worry. tahnk you so much
[02:52:30] <Cork> np
[02:59:30] <SugaSlide> im asuming since 1.9 this channel musta been a blaze :P
[02:59:45] <SugaSlide> the migrate plugin is really really really nice
[02:59:49] <SugaSlide> thanks guys
[03:00:00] <SugaSlide> (if any of the devs who worked on it are here)
[03:00:46] <makin> Cork, one more thing. I have infinite scroll, so I need to ellipse the new elements in the dom. This plugin have live option but I don't know how to use the params. http://pvdspek.github.com/jquery.autoellipsis/
[03:02:06] <makin> Now Ia have it, and is working fine: $('.games-desc').ellipsis(); But I need to add the live option for the new items.
[03:03:09] <Cork> makin: the first selector should be the parent
[03:03:47] <Cork> $('parent').allipsis('.games-desc', { setTitle: 'something });
[03:03:54] <Cork> *$('parent').ellipsis('.games-desc', { setTitle: 'something });
[03:04:19] <makin> thanks!
[03:08:12] <scarlet_razor> hai.. again.. can someone help me by checking this.....http://jsfiddle.net/PT5sz/
[03:08:17] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/PT5sz/
[03:09:05] <discorpia> any jquery mobile users here? where should i put event binds on new page loads? pageinit seems to be called before the new content is added
[03:09:52] <discorpia> or should i use live() in the jquery ready() function to have it executed once and be applied to all pages loaded by ajax?
[03:10:15] <Cork> discorpia: can't help you with mobile; but you should NEVER use .live
[03:10:31] <Cork> use .delegate or .on's delegate syntax if you need that feature
[03:10:48] <Cork> discorpia: live is deprecated in 1.7+ and removed in 1.9
[03:11:10] <greek> Hi fellas. I've got an event that's firing when I click on a link. Inside this event, I'm executing an Ajax call. For some reason, this Ajax call is getting executed multiple times. I've stuck an alert in the line directly above the Ajax call, but the alert on gets called once, despite the Ajax call firing 2, 3 sometimes up to 5 or 6 times What gives? Thanks.
[03:11:11] <Cork> and it performs poorly, and there is no reason to use it
[03:11:53] <Cork> greek: code plese
[03:16:43] <noregret> I have this structure http://jsfiddle.net/QtRDL/ but the parts added dynamically are from class="spams index" onwards, so the jquery part is not selecting '.isAnalyzed', any ideas ? (it is selected correctly in jsfiddle just because nothing is dynamic here)
[03:19:03] <discorpia> Cork: hmm, i think my problems with using on() might have been related to the fact that pageinit happens before the new page is loaded (or seem to atleast)
[03:20:17] <dannNiel> Hi. Is there a plugin to change the textcolor vom left to right as animation?
[03:25:29] <xec> dannNiel: not that i know of. but you can change the text color from red to blue, for instance
[03:26:25] <dannNiel> xec: ok. Animating the color change I've already. but I was looking for an animation, which changes the color vom left to right, not every letter at the same time
[03:26:37] <dannNiel> xec: i will try another solution, thank you
[03:27:23] <xec> you could probably make one yourself, loop through the letters and put them each in their own element, then animate each of them the same, with a slight delay between
[03:33:29] <le_gars> Hey I have a question...
[03:34:26] <scarlet_razor> sorry fellas... i really stuck.. i know this is very simple...
[03:34:26] <scarlet_razor> but it take a while to find the solution
[03:34:26] <scarlet_razor> can someone spare time to give some solution http://jsfiddle.net/PT5sz/3/
[03:34:38] <nebmo88> hi im trying to make a table row clone itself but doesnt seem to work (http://jsfiddle.net/NCM7A/1/).
[03:34:38] <le_gars> If I have a <a href> which is styled as a button and I when I click it want an alert to fire how would I go about
[03:34:47] <le_gars> ?
[03:35:17] <le_gars> I  mean the element just returns a prevDefaultObject
[03:35:48] <le_gars> I can do it fine in the browser but in my application impossible.
[03:36:13] <le_gars> Im on jquery 1.4.4 (in my company we have that)
[03:36:56] <noregret> scarlet_razor: what are you trying to do
[03:37:48] <noregret> scarlet_razor: i mean why tes = $().attr()... why no params to attr() ?
[03:37:53] <scarlet_razor> make css background changed if the val() or attr() of a class is on spesific value
[03:38:25] <noregret> scarlet_razor: what do you mean, you are already selecting the .tes class..
[03:38:44] <noregret> you want to compare the class 'tes' to another string ? it IS 'tes' ...
[03:38:52] <scarlet_razor> noregret: but the tr css not chnage
[03:39:12] <scarlet_razor> i want to check the tes class
[03:39:24] <scarlet_razor> if found the spesific value the td become colored
[03:40:15] <noregret> scarlet_razor: http://jsfiddle.net/PT5sz/4/
[03:40:25] <noregret> scarlet_razor: their class is dynamic ?
[03:41:04] <nFFF> scarlet_razor, your elements have no attributes ?
[03:41:49] <nFFF> your code doesn't make sense on a few levels
[03:42:57] <scarlet_razor> i think my problem is about the selector...
[03:43:02] <scarlet_razor> im checking on it...
[03:43:08] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/PT5sz/5/
[03:43:14] <nFFF> is this what you want to achieve?
[03:43:18] <Cork> noregret: did you get your event problem fixed?
[03:43:19] <noregret> scarlet_razor: like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/PT5sz/6/
[03:43:59] <scarlet_razor> thanks... noregret
[03:44:06] <scarlet_razor> the each function
[03:44:10] <scarlet_razor> i forget it...
[03:44:18] <scarlet_razor> and the wrong element select
[03:44:31] <noregret> Cork: not raelly, i was select 'body' and no idea why that didn't work, so i selected a lower tree. i wanted body though to apply it to the whole page, since the lower tree is in a single tab so the rest of the tabs won't get afffected
[03:44:43] <le_gars> Anyone got a clue?
[03:44:50] <Cork> noregret: does this work for you http://jsfiddle.net/QtRDL/1/ ?
[03:45:12] <scarlet_razor> once again thank.... sorry for my basic question... im not getting used to jquery...
[03:46:16] <le_gars> How would one select a a href element in jquery an have it alert something on click?
[03:46:33] <Cork> le_gars: href isn't an element
[03:46:43] <le_gars> ok
[03:46:49] <Cork> le_gars: do you mean bind an event to a link with a specific href on it?
[03:46:50] <noregret> Cork: nope, it didn't
[03:46:53] <SugaSlide> $("*[href]').on("click",function(){ alert
[03:46:57] <Cork> noregret: are you clicking the link?
[03:47:08] <SugaSlide> but its seriously costly.. dont do it
[03:47:17] <Cork> noregret: or are you actually clicking the checkbox
[03:47:17] <le_gars> yes like that
[03:47:41] <noregret> Cork: the checkbox, .isanalyzed is the checkbox
[03:47:42] <le_gars> so thats why it is returning a prevObject??
[03:47:50] <le_gars> the fact that it is not an element??
[03:47:56] <Cork> $('a[href]') is a bit better
[03:48:20] <Cork> le_gars: you can't select attributes; period
[03:48:28] <le_gars> hm
[03:48:28] <Cork> you can select elements with attributes
[03:48:33] <noregret> Cork: and the select that's working is .spams.index which is a lower div
[03:48:39] <noregret> selector *
[03:48:54] <Cork> noregret: if i click the checkbox i get a console.log message
[03:49:02] <Cork> noregret: what isn't working for you?
[03:49:08] <noregret> i'm still confused why 'body' wno't work.. even though it won't change
[03:49:20] <Cork> body works for me
[03:49:29] <le_gars> ok and then adressing the class of that href how would I do then?
[03:49:33] <Cork> you had two in your original jsfiddle; that was all i changed
[03:49:40] <noregret> Cork: yeah, the .isanalyzed is dynamically added, i mentioned that above, it's not static as in jsfiddle
[03:49:50] <Cork> le_gars: uh... class of an href?!?
[03:49:59] <noregret> I have this structure http://jsfiddle.net/QtRDL/ but the parts added dynamically are from class="spams index" onwards, so the jquery part is not selecting '.isAnalyzed', any ideas ? (it is selected correctly in jsfiddle just because nothing is dynamic here)
[03:50:02] <noregret> Cork: ^
[03:50:04] <Cork> le_gars: again an element can have a class, an attribute can't
[03:50:41] <Cork> noregret: could you try making a working example (working in the form that it does the dynamic actions your talking about
[03:50:46] <Cork> )
[03:50:48] <le_gars> well this a tag do.
[03:50:48] <noregret> I created teh jsfiddle just to show the html structure and find out why 'body' selector isn't working
[03:50:56] <noregret> hmm
[03:50:56] <Cork> le_gars: no href isn't a tag
[03:50:57] <noregret> i'll try
[03:51:21] <SugaSlide> a is a tag with href being the attribute
[03:51:31] <Cork> le_gars: if you add <href> to your page you're creating invalid html
[03:51:33] <le_gars> sorry sorry thanks
[03:51:34] <SugaSlide> <a href="
[03:51:42] <le_gars> I mean the a got a class
[03:51:51] <le_gars> not the href of course :(
[03:52:06] <Cork> le_gars: and you want to select the a tag based on the href to get its classes?
[03:52:18] <Cork> s/and you/so you/
[03:52:50] <Cork> $('a[href="url"]').attr('class')
[03:53:05] <Cork> but i would say that feels backwards >_>
[03:53:18] <le_gars> I want to select the class that I give when a condition is met and make a alert fire on click. So I have the a and when condition is met set the class and make an alert go of when you click it
[03:53:23] <Cork> you should be selecting on class to find href not the other way around :(
[03:53:24] <le_gars> did that make sense :)
[03:53:25] <Cork> *:)
[03:53:54] <Cork> le_gars: do you have a class for the target link?
[03:53:58] <root4> quit
[03:54:01] <Cork> that will always be there?
[03:54:12] <Cork> or id would work too
[03:54:23] <le_gars> it has a default class that is always there yes
[03:54:37] <le_gars> so in this scenario Im merely adding a class
[03:54:50] <le_gars> if the customer has a certain label
[03:55:00] <Cork> so $('a.default-class').on('click', function() { $(this).addClass('other-class'); }) ?
[03:55:20] <Cork> or even $(document).on('click', 'a.default-class', function() { $(this).addClass('other-class'); }) ?
[03:56:52] <le_gars> well I'm already the adding of the class in my view. It's a haml view so Im dealing with ruby. So there I have like if @blabla.something add class
[03:57:25] <le_gars> so then I have it. Then in my jquery I want to make the alert go of on click when I have that class.
[03:57:37] <Cork> you will have to converting it from js to yaml your self
[04:02:34] <rasu> hello i get an error on my doctype line when i use newline in textareas and klick send button. works if i dont user newline
[04:02:43] <rasu> anybody knows why?
[04:03:39] <le_gars> Cork: I did not ask for converting any js to haml. I was wondering about the logic how to adress a class on a tag and make an alert go of on click.
[04:03:53] <le_gars> The haml part I got covered.
[04:31:39] <Darkstar1_> the slide toggle function? How can I specify that it be in the closed/up position by default?
[04:38:14] <Cork> Darkstar1_: run .hide() on domready
[04:38:39] <xec>  you can run, but you can't hide
[04:38:51] <Haprog> :D
[04:39:09] <Darkstar1_> 0_o? explain.
[04:39:11] <Haprog> just set the elements tyle to display:none by default in CSS
[04:39:19] <Haprog> *element style
[04:47:14] <libin> Hi, I am tring to use a Autocomplete plugin in jsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vq6MH/146/ . It is working fine. But when i try to use it in my project it is not working properly. here is my code http://pastebin.com/aQdQLJDW  Thanks
[04:47:34] <vmassuchetto> I would like to build a multiple e-mail "to" field that validate, itemize and apply styles to the completed e-mails. Is there any plugin that can offer a functionality similar to that?
[04:48:19] <vmassuchetto> Pretty much like the Dropbox e-mails field on the "Share" window".
[04:53:31] <libin> Hi, I am tring to use a Autocomplete plugin in jsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vq6MH/146/ . It is working fine. But when i try to use it in my project it is not working properly. here is my code http://pastebin.com/aQdQLJDW  Thanks
[05:01:34] <zulu-gula> I have big issue with ajax call - it works perfectly under firefox/chrome/opera, but IE does not work, becouse I'm using special chars in ajax call
[05:04:18] <zulu-gula> the code looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yezmH/
[05:09:50] <Sonderblade> How do you override a function in a jquery plugin?
[05:11:12] <philhutchinson> use $.extend();
[05:14:23] <philhutchinson> or use something like http://jsfiddle.net/KC77F/
[05:18:02] <Sonderblade> not sure how to do that since the function names are only visible inside a local scope
[05:43:04] <cola_> *syntax
[05:43:06] <cola_> plz, anyone give the synatx for registration
[05:57:06] <noregret> how can I add next to $(this) ?
[05:57:50] <marcules> $(this).append($(this).next());
[05:57:51] <marcules> ?
[06:00:24] <noregret> marcules: i dont want to append inside $(this), i want to add next to it..e.g <div id=x></div><div id=y></div> i want to add <div id=z></div> after x, not inside it
[06:00:52] <noregret> where $(this) is x for example
[06:00:55] <marcules> $(this).append($(this).parent().next());
[06:01:02] <marcules> Wait, I have to read that again
[06:01:02] <marcules> ^^
[06:01:10] <noregret> lol
[06:01:41] <noregret> closest one is $(this).parent().append()
[06:01:49] <marcules> noregret, .after()
[06:01:52] <noregret> but that won't put it next to this, it will be put at the end
[06:01:54] <noregret> ah
[06:01:54] <marcules> ?after
[06:01:56] <noregret> let me check
[06:01:57] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[06:01:58] <noregret> it
[06:11:29] <noregret> I'm trying to fadein an icon then wait for 1 sec then fadeout, this is hiding it all, the whole selector. .append('<span class="ui-icon ui-icon-check"></span>').hide().fadeIn('slow').delay(1000).fadeOut('slow'); any ideas
[06:15:44] <shoky> var span = $('<span..></span>');  whatever.append(span);  span.hide().fadeIn().delay(1000).fadeOut();
[06:15:59] <shoky> (or span.appendTo(whatever).hide().fadeIn()... )
[06:32:23] <Bruno`> Hello !
[06:33:50] <Bruno`> I am very stuck here. I am using JQuery to do some ajax requests, to a homemade c++ server. Works fine on safari, firefox, chrome. With IE, i get the error "No transport". If I add the line "jQuery.support.cors = true;" I get the error :TypeError: Access is Denied"
[06:33:54] <juria_roberts> Hi why is this giving an error in console http://jsfiddle.net/TRJmW/
[06:33:54] <Bruno`> Any idea ?

[06:40:11] <Miki> anyone help please?
[06:41:03] <juria_roberts> I cant understand why instance is coming undefined
[06:42:28] <Miki> qtip2
[06:42:33] <Miki> why not work in jquery 1.9.0??
[06:42:44] <juria_roberts> Miki: it gives the same error
[06:43:22] <Miki> juria_roberts: what you think will fix in the future?
[06:43:39] <juria_roberts> Miki: didnt understand
[06:43:53] <Miki> juria_roberts: when will fix the problem :)?
[06:44:24] <juria_roberts> Miki: i dont know im hoping someone here might see whats wrong in the code
[06:45:35] <Miki> juria_roberts: okey thanks
[06:45:37] <Mottie1> Miki: qtip2 is still using $.browser.msie in the code, which jquery 1.9.0 doesn't support
[06:45:58] <Miki> Mottie1: ah thanks for info :X
[06:46:13] <Miki> Mottie1: what you think this is will be fixed?
[06:46:38] <Mottie1> no clue, I'll submit an issue with the plugin now
[06:46:50] <Miki> okey :)
[06:46:52] <juria_roberts> Miki: sorry i know u were talking to qtip2
[06:46:57] <Mottie1> errr never mind: https://github.com/Craga89/qTip2/issues/459
[06:46:57] <b-ot> Mottie1, issue #459 by ludwiczakpawel (1w 2d ago): qtip2 doesn't work with jQuery 1.9.0

[06:47:25] <Miki> :)
[06:47:42] <Miki> thanks guys for info and help :P
[06:50:10] <Mottie1> varnie: yes
[06:51:45] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: I see that same error on the home page where you got that script
[06:52:07] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: yeah strange suddenly it stopped working
[06:52:36] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: check out chosen http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/, maybe it'll work as an alternative?
[06:52:48] <shoky> Bruno` you shouldn't set $.support.cors yourself.
[06:52:57] <shoky> Bruno` what IE are you talking about
[06:53:06] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: i cant change it, it will be too much effort
[06:53:45] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: it's not that much different in set up
[06:54:16] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: ok will take a look
[06:54:30] <Mottie1> wait
[06:54:46] <Mottie1> try an updated version from here https://github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget
[06:57:23] <Bruno`> shoky: 8
[06:58:14] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: it looks like the newest code doesn't have the same error: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/TRJmW/1/
[06:58:52] <delight> @Mottie1 @juria_roberts before you go for chosen I'd suggest rather using select2 http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[06:58:55] <b-ot> suggestratherusingselect2http:ivaynberggithub.com - â˜º AVAILABLE
[06:58:56] <shoky> Bruno`:  try including this  https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[06:59:02] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: wow u fixed it
[06:59:22] <shoky> Bruno`: IE8 only supports CORS using the XDR transport
[06:59:24] <Brodingo> rmill
[06:59:33] <Mottie1> I didn't fix it :P
[06:59:38] <Bruno`> shoky: Amazing, seems to work
[07:04:04] <shoky> Bruno` cool. read the bottom post here http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283
[07:04:55] <hariom> I have some html inside a div with style=display:none along with some other html content in other div (these divs are visible). After the document ready, I am fetching the html content by .html() method on div which is display:none and embedding that html into another div which was visible before.
[07:05:15] <hariom> I see that a select box appears twice. Rest of the things are rendered fine
[07:05:21] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: its working in fiddler only
[07:05:27] <hariom> Any clues why is so?
[07:05:32] <shoky> ?demo @ hariom
[07:05:33] <bot-t> hariom, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:05:59] <hariom> bot-t: unfortunately I can't as it has server side code which is running locally
[07:06:01] <bot-t> hariom, Stored "unfortunately I can't as it has server side code which".
[07:06:01] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: did you download the updated plugin?
[07:06:02] <Bruno`> shoky: it really works. Thanks again.

[07:08:24] <the_kick> hi i want to take my jquery skills to the next level, and ive been following some good jQuery plugin tuts, however, not much of it makes sense to me, such as things like _proto and init() functions.
[07:08:25] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: thanks will see
[07:08:49] <the_kick> would you agree that its best for me to build a better foundation in Javascipt OOP first.
[07:09:02] <the_kick> and THEN go back to looking at plugins etc
[07:09:06] <shoky> ?learn @ the_kick
[07:09:06] <bot-t> the_kick, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:09:40] <iman> are all of you use sublime for jquery and js ?
[07:09:50] <the_kick> got a good video tut actually on object oriented JS
[07:09:55] <the_kick> iman: yes
[07:10:05] <the_kick> i say all, i mean me
[07:10:32] <iman> the_kick: what is different between free or license version ?
[07:10:55] <Mottie1> iman: sublime 2 is a great text editor, but I'm used to my old clunky one
[07:11:14] <the_kick> iman: with the license version, the developer who made it gets to feed his kids
[07:11:22] <Mottie1> iman: I think it says on the web site... I don't think there is one
[07:11:29] <the_kick> ^^
[07:11:31] <Mottie1> a difference I mean
[07:11:48] <Mottie1> LOL besides what the_kick said :P
[07:12:12] <the_kick> you get nagged on the free one, its not expensive though, why not just contribute ?
[07:12:45] <derbie> Hello
[07:13:03] <iman> the_kick: i live in a private country over millions sanctions with any international relation, no visa, no master, no ......
[07:13:04] <iman> damn
[07:13:29] <the_kick> iman: which?
[07:13:35] <derbie> I am a javascript/jqeury noob. Is it possible to use jquery to add <input> fields to a form ?
[07:13:55] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: the demos itself in the zip have the same error
[07:14:00] <derbie> when you click an <a> element?
[07:14:00] <Mottie1> derbie: yep, $('<input>').appendTo('form')
[07:14:16] <derbie> Thanks Mottie1i'll search around try it out
[07:14:24] <iman> the_kick: what plugins do you use with sublime ?
[07:14:31] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: hmm, is it using jQuery 1.9 and jQuery UI 1.10?
[07:14:43] <Mottie1> like the jsFiddle?
[07:14:47] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: no seems to be using 1
[07:15:07] <Mottie1> 1 will target the latest version
[07:15:11] <Mottie1> what about UI?
[07:15:26] <juria_roberts> 1
[07:15:33] <Mottie1> hmmm
[07:15:35] <the_kick> iman: the main plugins i use are
[07:16:10] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: sec, let me download it and try
[07:16:26] <the_kick> the enhanced sidebar
[07:16:27] <juria_roberts> Mottie1: ok thanks please try the demo filter
[07:16:34] <the_kick> package control, and thats about it
[07:16:57] <Mottie1> iman: there are lots of blog posts out there about useful plugins
[07:17:23] <the_kick> plus there is also #sublimetext, right here on freenode
[07:17:27] <iman> I am a java developer, and  so depend to IDE, unfortunately
[07:18:11] <toxz> hi! why do i get different behaviour with this: http://jsfiddle.net/CsG9a/ in chrome & ff. I thought chrome is doing right and firefox wrong!? Or do i miss something?
[07:20:49] <shoky> toxz: you're missing the event argument to the event handlers
[07:21:05] <lombrozo> this is driving me crazy, how do I prevent a anonymous user from accessing a page and display login form instead please?
[07:21:09] <shoky> toxz: and you're depending on the global event object, which you shouldn't do
[07:21:52] <toxz> shoky - youre right
[07:21:55] <toxz> ive missed that one
[07:21:58] <toxz> thx
[07:22:24] <johnkpaul> damn, I've been bit by that so much toxz
[07:22:37] <johnkpaul> using a linter is the only thing that helps
[07:22:44] <johnkpaul> it would warn you that event is coming out of nowhere
[07:22:54] <shoky> or calling it something other than 'event' by default ;p
[07:22:57] <shoky> 'e' is great ;D
[07:23:24] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: well it looks like only the very latest, non-labeled version has fixed the error, there isn't an easier way to download it other than saving it from these pages directly: https://raw.github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/master/src/jquery.multiselect.js and https://raw.github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/master/src/jquery.multiselect.filter.js
[07:23:30] <johnkpaul> shoky: sure, but I am usually as verbose as possible
[07:23:45] <Fenikkusu> Can anyone explain to me why an object created using Object.create would not have a prototype?
[07:23:49] <shoky> gotcha
[07:23:57] <juria_roberts> Mottiel:how did u get those files
[07:23:58] <johnkpaul> shoky: especially because I oven use function(i,e){}
[07:24:06] <johnkpaul> often*
[07:24:20] <johnkpaul> Fenikkusu: would not have a prototype, or would not have __proto__?
[07:24:23] <Mottie1> juria_roberts: directly from github
[07:24:31] <shoky> aye. lint/ide helps a ton
[07:24:44] <johnkpaul> Fenikkusu: Object.create does not return a function,, only functions have the .prototype property
[07:25:05] <johnkpaul> what Object.create(obj) does is return a new object that has it's __proto__ pointing at obj
[07:30:05] <HardFu> $waiting = $('<span id="waiting" />');
[07:30:06] <HardFu> if($link.parent().is($waiting)) {
[07:30:08] <Fenikkusu_> johnkpaul, O={a:1};b=Object.create(O);alert b.a
[07:30:11] <HardFu> what is wrong with this
[07:30:31] <HardFu> basically I'm wrapping clicked element and want to check whether already wrapped
[07:30:39] <johnkpaul> ?eval O={a:1};b=Object.create(O); b.a;
[07:30:43] <bot-t> johnkpaul: TypeError: Object.create is not a function
[07:30:46] <Fenikkusu_> opps alert b.prototype.a
[07:30:52] <Mottie1> HardFu: check the ID instead
[07:31:02] <johnkpaul> ha, bot has a very old version of js
[07:31:12] <johnkpaul> Fenikkusu_: why do you want it on the prototype property? it doesn't exist
[07:31:16] <johnkpaul> that's not what object.create is for
[07:31:21] <HardFu> Mottie1: i thought it would be more 'clean' to refer to same var which corresponds to dom el
[07:32:51] <Mottie1> HardFu: I mean it looks like it should work... I don't know about cleaner
[07:33:01] <nebmo> hi, i'm trying to duplicate a table row but its not working (http://jsfiddle.net/NCM7A/5/) whats wrong here?
[07:33:37] <Mottie1> HardFu: what does $link.parent() return, try adding a console.log
[07:34:19] <HardFu> [p, prevObject: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1], context: a, jquery: "1.9.0", constructor: function, init: functionâ€¦]
[07:34:19] <HardFu> :)
[07:34:31] <HardFu> the <a>
[07:35:34] <Mottie1> HardFu: what does your HTML look like?
[07:36:25] <HardFu> <p><a href="/some/url">Are you sure</a></p>
[07:36:37] <HardFu> when clicked i want it to become
[07:36:45] <Mottie1> so the parent() is a p instead of the span
[07:36:50] <HardFu> <p><span id="waiting"><a href="/some/url">Are you sure</a></span></p>
[07:36:57] <Mottie1> maybe you could use closest
[07:37:21] <HardFu> don't get me wrong, I got it working, but I have a feeling there's a nicer way to write it :)
[07:37:24] <Mottie1> HardFu: if($link.closest('span').is($waiting)) {
[07:37:29] <HardFu> just want to expand the knowledge
[07:37:46] <Mottie1> oh nm
[07:37:59] <Mottie1> that would work anyway LOL
[07:38:54] <Mottie1> "nicer" way to write it is user dependent
[07:39:48] <HardFu> $waiting = $('<span id="waiting" />');
[07:39:56] <HardFu> I want to refer to $waiting always
[07:40:03] <Mottie1> actually
[07:40:19] <Mottie1> that will point to an element detached from the dom
[07:40:33] <Mottie1> $waiting = $('#waiting'); is what you need
[07:40:47] <HardFu> but i don't have the span in the dom yet
[07:40:49] <HardFu> at that point
[07:42:59] <HardFu> http://pastie.org/5858230
[07:43:00] <HardFu> here
[07:43:16] <HardFu> the working version
[07:43:52] <Mottie1> nebmo: the row need to be appended to the tbody: addTableRow($("#tableitems tbody"));
[07:44:02] <Mottie1> HardFu: sec
[07:45:47] <Mottie1> HardFu: honestly, I think all of that can be accomplished with just adding and removing class names from the link
[07:45:56] <shoky> HardFu it's because .wrap clones
[07:46:18] <HardFu> I'm wrapping because i need to position the html
[07:46:45] <Mottie1> class can position the HTML too... and thanks shoky, I didn't realize that either! :P
[07:47:10] <cola_> how to create auto pagination under existing slideshow ??
[07:47:31] <HardFu> Mottie, basically, this is inline confirmation
[07:47:49] <HardFu> user clicks the link and some html is shown just above the clicked link
[07:48:00] <HardFu> basically 'are you sure?' :)
[07:48:07] <Mottie1> yeah I get it
[07:48:18] <Mottie1> cola_: that is way too general of a question
[07:48:57] <Mottie1> HardFu: maybe append it to the dom before doing all of that manipulation
[07:49:43] <Fenikkusu> johnkpaul, Apologies, had something come up. Ulitimatly, I'm trying learn at this point, and nothing I'm finding is explaining this stuff to me. I'm trying to understand/learn multiple inheritance with js and I think that I'm supposed to be using Object.create, and my understanding is that the parent is .prototype, so doing this.prototype.apply(this) should work I would think.
[07:49:47] <shoky> or just  do .is('#waiting')  and stop trying to be clever
[07:50:23] <Fenikkusu> I come from a background in PHP OOP, so I'm having to unlearn a bit, but still.
[07:52:11] <cola_> @mottiel: wt?
[07:52:12] <shoky> Fenikkusu there's a big difference between an object/function's "prototype" property, and that object's actual prototype
[07:52:26] <shoky> Fenikkusu: regular objects don't have a "prototype" property
[07:53:23] <Fenikkusu> shoky, do you have any verbage explain this? As I said, I'm trying to learn proper plugin development within js/jquery
[07:53:28] <Mottie1> cola_: What slideshow? Isn't there one built-in to the slideshow? What have you tried?
[07:54:38] <cola_> @mottiel: i have slideshow with me.i want auto pagination under tht.can i share  my  fiddle wid  u?
[07:54:49] <Mottie1> share away!

[07:57:23] <bot-t> Fenikkusu, jQuery Boilerplate - http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[07:57:36] <johnkpaul> Fenikkusu: johnkpaul: http://killdream.github.com/blog/2011/10/understanding-javascript-oop/index.html summarizes Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, using concepts from ECMAScript 5, and relating them back to older paradigms from ECMAScript 3
[07:57:40] <shoky> Fenikkusu:  objects have a prototype chain but it's not accessed using a "prototype" property
[07:57:55] <johnkpaul> disregard the boilkerplate link Fenikkusu, that's not what I was thinking of
[07:58:06] <johnkpaul> Fenikkusu: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[07:58:27] <johnkpaul> how much I wish we had better jargon to explain this to people
[07:58:29] <johnkpaul> there are two prototypes
[07:58:33] <johnkpaul> they mean completely differnt things
[07:58:45] <johnkpaul> I'd rather call one the prototype property and one dunderproto, but that's not gaining any traction
[07:58:57] <Fenikkusu> lol
[07:58:57] <johnkpaul> all object have dunder proto
[07:59:08] <johnkpaul> only functions have prototype propertyes

[08:00:30] <johnkpaul> which is what I said
[08:00:37] <Fenikkusu> Okay, I'll read through them and see if I can make heads or tails of this stuff.

[08:52:02] <andrepadez_> hi, i haven't used jquery for a while... is there an equivalent to jquery.live() that listens to objects that come into the DOM later?
[08:52:14] <Lichurec> Hi there ;)
[08:52:26] <BillCriswell> andrepadez_: You can just use .on()
[08:52:33] <Lichurec> Fast question - did the jQ team change the way .data() is handled?
[08:53:12] <Lichurec> it used to be possible to view jQ's events data attached to a element by using $(el).data('events')
[08:53:43] <Lichurec> but apparently its not anymore (unless I'm doing sth wrong here)
[08:53:45] <andrepadez_> BillCriswell:  i am using form-owner').on('submit', function(e){  but it doesn't fire
[08:53:45] <BillCriswell> andrepadez_: You could do like... $('.iHoldAjaxLoadedStuff').on('click', '.iAmAjaxLoadedThing', function(){ // Wooo });

[08:58:01] <Lichurec> Shit :/
[08:58:10] <Lichurec> that was a nifty dev solution
[09:02:36] <Mottie1> DJDan: that's a lot to ask... can you use css to align them? And you can disable a question and/or a dropped answer after it has been dropped (see the docs http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/)

[09:56:41] <sven_oostenbrink> I use JQM for my mobile site, and for the design we have, all pages load an empty div data-role="page", which then loads the data-role="header" data-role="content" and data-role="footer" HTML though ajax, which is then inserted into  div data-role="page" using $().html(data), but it seems that JQM is not picking up on that HTML, I see near plain text instead of the JQM interface.. How can I make JQM aware of these HTML updates?
[09:59:24] <otiuk> i need a little help with:  http://jsfiddle.net/gE6J2/ .. i'm just looking to focus on in input field and flash the background color a few times to draw attention.. and for some reason it isn't working
[09:59:39] <hugo_moss> can someone tell me how i can use settimeout on fancybox? i want it so that when i click an image link, it shows the preloader img through $.fancybox.showLoading for about 2 seconds, and then loads the image, because otherwise for some reason, with my easing function, the easeopen doesnt show, instead its very jerky

[10:14:35] <VinSpee> I'm trying to write a simple toggle class that I can reuse. What i have so far looks like this: https://gist.github.com/4636551
[10:15:10] <VinSpee> The problem: Toggle.doToggle is being executed immediately upon initialization, I can;t figure out why. any ideas?
[10:17:00] <Eviltwin> Can you compile this to JavaScript
[10:17:06] <VinSpee> yes
[10:17:08] <Eviltwin> And link that in another gist
[10:18:39] <VinSpee> Eviltwin https://gist.github.com/4636634
[10:19:07] <Eviltwin> Not sure how familiar with are with JavaScript
[10:19:15] <Eviltwin> But do you understand what's happening here? this.$toggler.on("click", this.doToggle(this.$togglable));
[10:19:36] <VinSpee> Well, I think that I am, but I am not haha.
[10:20:24] <Eviltwin> So if you do a("click", b(c))
[10:20:28] <VinSpee> when this object's var $toggler is clicked, execute it's method called "doToggle", and pass into it youtr $togglable property
[10:20:34] <Eviltwin> That calls b on c then passes that to the call to a
[10:21:07] <Eviltwin> In this case that means this.doToggle is being called and passed to this.$toggler.on
[10:21:32] <Eviltwin> Let me look up the CoffeeScript syntax for what you need to do
[10:23:38] <Eviltwin> Okay, I think the syntax is @$toggler.on("click", (event) => @doToggle(@togglable));
[10:23:48] <Eviltwin> But I'm not 100% on the CoffeScript
[10:24:37] <VinSpee> so is the only way to that by using the "fat arrow" (binds this)
[10:24:57] <VinSpee> doesn't that duplicate the function for each instance?
[10:29:13] <chronos> how I can o with $.proxy to change context of a trigger?
[10:30:20] <johnkpaul> chronos: you cannot, that's not what $.proxy is for
[10:30:52] <chronos> there is something to force it?
[10:31:16] <johnkpaul> chronos: not at the time of triggering
[10:31:27] <VinSpee> thanks Eviltwin
[10:31:30] <johnkpaul> but you can at the time of adiding the handler
[10:31:40] <chronos> I can make a closure?
[10:32:25] <johnkpaul> chronos: no, I mean instead of something like $().trigger('click', handler, contextObj), you can use $().on('click', $.proxy(handler, contextObj);
[10:32:38] <Eviltwin> VinSpee: If you don't do that, you won't have a handle to your object in doToggle
[10:32:52] <VinSpee> ah
[10:33:11] <chronos> johnkpaul: I triggering a event from a plugin, dont have control about binded functions :)
[10:33:19] <Eviltwin> If you can work without that (and only with the $toggler element itself) then you're fine
[10:33:38] <Eviltwin> And can do @$togler.on("click", @doToggle);
[10:33:44] <johnkpaul> chronos: oh, you don't provide the callback eiher?
[10:33:55] <Eviltwin> Then refer to "this" inside the doToggle function and it will be @$toggler
[10:34:12] <chronos> johnkpaul: on this trigger I just fire the event
[10:34:32] <chronos> $("input", container).trigger("custonEvent")
[10:35:25] <VinSpee> Eviltwin, nope I think I have to pass the object in as well so it knows what togglable is

[10:35:49] <Eviltwin> VinSpee: Probably, yeah

[10:44:31] <Eviltwin> Well I'm not sure what this is supposed to do
[10:44:35] <Eviltwin> So I can't fix it any more than that
[10:45:16] <otiuk> uncomment the alert and you will see it working just with alerts between the timeout's
[10:46:07] <Eviltwin> If you mean the effect in the Result pane is different than without it, then I'm not seeing it
[10:46:19] <Eviltwin> If you mean alerts are happening then yes, yes they are
[10:46:48] <Caelum> is there a url for latest 1.x -ui?
[10:47:02] <otiuk> go to the example i posted (http://jsfiddle.net/gE6J2/8/ ) and then uncomment the alerts.. and then you should see in the results the alert happens along with the background of the text field changes colours

[11:11:47] <alyis> I know you can choose something based on id or class what about by name?
[11:11:59] <alyis> so if like <input name="this">

[11:22:34] <sven_oostenbrink> Seems $('element').trigger('create') can be used to force JQM to evaluate the contents of the selected element, but results look different from what it looks like if I load HTML directly.. is this normal?

However, on some pages the ... is present, on others it isn't - any ideas how to get around this?
[11:33:34] <alyis> So I am accessing an object as messages[0][k].fieldname
[11:33:46] <alyis> var sort = $('select[name="risk_filter"]').val();
[11:33:49] <alyis> is the name of the field
[11:35:26] <GLaDOSv2> any idea guys?

[11:47:01] <hugo_moss> how can i fix a conflict between 3 plugins using their own jquery library?
[11:48:40] <Phoenixz> hugo_moss: IIRC, with a construction, more or less, like this (function($){  plugin here  })(jquery);
[11:48:55] <iman> is it true? $("#buyProductDialog input[name=isDealingAvailable]").val()
[11:49:26] <iman> i mean in burProductDialog what input that's is DealingAvailable
[11:49:39] <iman> it return  undefined
[11:50:26] <djQuery> $("#buyProductDialog input[name='isDealingAvailable']")
[11:50:43] <djQuery> iman, you left out the inner 's
[11:51:23] <stewbydoo> why when I use toggle it chooses inline-block rather than just block?
[11:51:54] <hugo_moss> Phoenixz: can you explain how that code works?
[11:52:00] <djQuery> stewbydoo, so that it will work correctly
[11:52:14] <iman> djQuery: doesn't work yet, snippet code is here http://jsfiddle.net/4KdcU/
[11:52:46] <stewbydoo> i just looked at the API and the way toggle works is its just changing display property to none then back to what it was before
[11:54:01] <stewbydoo> or if it was none originally then it should default to block
[11:54:06] <stewbydoo> not inline-block
[11:54:14] <stewbydoo> am I going crazy?!?1
[11:54:47] <hugo_moss> Phoenixz: what about $.noconflict
[11:55:47] <djQuery> you do know that the attribut selector is very slow right?
[11:56:20] <djQuery> how many diffent types of buttons are in the grand parent of the button?
[11:56:28] <djQuery> iman, ^^
[11:57:46] <wongon> I have a <meta charset ..> inside the head tag.  When I run in the console: jQuery("head meta[charset]").after("blah"), it doesn't insert 'blah' right after that meta tag.
[11:58:09] <djQuery> iman, http://jsfiddle.net/4KdcU/1/
[11:58:22] <wongon> this is in IE
[11:58:51] <djQuery> iman, something I do as well is add a class with the same as the name of the element
[11:59:09] <djQuery> then I can use the much faster class selector
[12:00:06] <wongon> doing the same thing in Chrome works
[12:04:51] <djQuery> wongon, so what part is it faling on?
[12:05:56] <djQuery> wongon, what if you just do jQuery('head meta')?
[12:07:19] <djQuery> wongon, or jQuery('head').find('meta').filter('[charset').after('whatever');
[12:07:44] <wongon> let me try that
[12:08:21] <djQuery> wongon, or how about $('head script').first().before('testin')
[12:18:51] <wongon> jQuery('head').find('meta[charset]')  seems to locate that meta tag, but adding a: .after('blah') or .insertAfter('blah') does not do anything
[12:23:23] <dougb> is it possible to increase the 'drop' area for sortable connected lists?
[12:24:35] <dougb> for example, on this page: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists if everything is moved over to column 1, you can't drag anything over to column 2 because the height of that UL is now 0

[12:36:09] <djQuery> iman, either \ all of them  your last selector worked it spit 1 out to the console

[12:37:21] <iman> djQuery: thank you, I really like JQuery and JS, although I am freshman in JS
[12:39:58] <chovy> how come <script src="//cdn.com/jquery.js"></script> doen't work?
[12:39:59] <djQuery> iman, http://jsfiddle.net/4KdcU/4/
[12:40:19] <noregret> I have a list of items to display, what is the best element to use for that where it won't take much space and look nice, i crossed out a <select> coz it's ugly.. any ideas ?
[12:41:26] <djQuery> noregret, ul?
[12:42:13] <djQuery> chovy, have you tried hitting that url with your browser
[12:42:25] <djQuery> are you using http or https ?
[12:42:33] <noregret> djQuery: it will have a space issue.. if the items are many (and they are)
[12:42:36] <djQuery> does CDN.com support both
[12:42:38] <chovy> djQuery: it's supposed to work, protocal-less url
[12:43:17] <chovy> yes
[12:43:22] <chovy> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js
[12:43:29] <chovy> works with http
[12:43:34] <djQuery> chovy, yes I know but if the page that you are accessing is using https the the url gets turned into https://cdn.com.....
[12:44:10] <chovy> oh that is probably the reason
[12:44:11] <djQuery> I prefer the google one as more comps use it so that more visitors are likely to have it cached
[12:44:15] <chovy> i'm using file://
[12:44:18] <chovy> to look at the page
[12:44:28] <djQuery> lol
[12:44:32] <wongon> anyone know why this would not work in ie? jQuery('head').find('meta[charset]')Â  seems to locate that meta tag, but adding a: .after('blah') or .insertAfter('blah') does not do anything
[12:45:37] <djQuery> wongon, have you searched the bugs, what version of IE are you having this issue with? what version of jquery?
[12:45:45] <nbt> noregret, you could use <ul> (or another element) with a set height and overflow set to scroll
[12:46:31] <djQuery> noregret, also ul can be set to go across the page not just up and down. essentially turning it into a grid
[12:46:41] <chovy> wongon: fiddle?
[12:46:59] <wongon> I'm using jQuery 1.9.0, and it's ie9
[12:47:28] <noregret> nbt: well, i'll use the jquery-ui dialog in this case
[12:47:31] <djQuery> chovy, he allready said it works correctly in other browsers so its most likely not his code but some edge case IE bug
[12:48:14] <djQuery> wongon, have you tested chrome and FF?
[12:49:15] <chovy> oh. until IE gets a real debugger, it will never "suck less"
[12:51:53] <wongon> y, this inserts 'blah' in Chrome: jQuery('head').find('meta[charset]').after('blah');
[12:52:21] <Eviltwin> ?after @ wongon
[12:52:22] <bot-t> wongon, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[12:54:45] <djQuery> chovy, ie's debugger is no chrome debugger but I used to use it effectively
[12:55:08] <djQuery> chovy, just the stupid errors that you get from console.log when you dont have the debugger open yet
[12:55:37] <djQuery> chovy, hit F12 while in IE then navigate to the page
[12:56:03] <Eviltwin> Do they finally have proper object support for console.log?
[12:56:50] <chovy> i don't have IE
[12:57:50] <wongon> I'm sorry, I don't understand how I'm misusing .after().  Example of correct usage please?
[12:58:02] <Eviltwin> ?after @ wongon
[12:58:02] <bot-t> wongon, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[12:58:05] <chovy> wongon: out of curiousity, does it work w/ a div in the body?
[12:58:07] <Eviltwin> Open that link
[12:58:09] <Eviltwin> And see
[12:58:12] <chovy> Maybe ie doesn't like manipulating <head>
[12:58:31] <Eviltwin> (I think he thinks it does something else)
[12:58:42] <Eviltwin> (Like a type of filter or something)
[12:58:53] <chovy> try .after('<meta name="author" />');
[13:00:15] <rindolf> Hi all.
[13:00:53] <rindolf> Does anyone know of a jQuery plugin that implements a mock-object wrapper around localStorage? Or should I write one myself?
[13:01:06] <lil-murph> Should it be alright to pass "success: null" to jQuery.ajax?
[13:01:25] <rindolf> Well, mock object is more like the null object refactoring.
[13:01:31] <Eviltwin> Just don't pass anything
[13:02:07] <lil-murph> Eviltwin: yeah, i'm working on some code that wraps it. I'm curious if I should check if my user passed in a null callback.
[13:03:29] <Eviltwin> I don't remember so I recommend you try paasing it
[13:03:33] <Eviltwin> passing*
[13:03:56] <lil-murph> Basically, the current developer has this code and I think it's silly: http://paste2.org/p/2796988 :)
[13:05:18] <Eviltwin> You can do both of those test with != null
[13:05:47] <Eviltwin> It's probably fine to just pass in successCb
[13:05:52] <lil-murph> mmkay :)
[13:05:55] <Eviltwin> But it will get called with the other args
[13:06:09] <Eviltwin> Not sure if you want to pass that along or not
[13:08:48] <wongon> In the console window of ie9, $('head') does not return anything, but jQuery('head') does.  Why?
[13:09:52] <Eviltwin> ?noconflict @ wongon
[13:09:52] <bot-t> wongon, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[13:09:58] <Eviltwin> Probably because of that
[13:14:03] <Kottizen> Hi everyone. Is the comment on line #1 true? Will line 2-4 increase/save performance? http://paste.kde.org/656624
[13:14:15] <DukeDrake> !
[13:14:23] <Kottizen> Assuming I use those variables instead of $('#...') each time I wan to call/change something.
[13:15:24] <Eviltwin> Kottizen: Yes but for ID lookups it will be marginal
[13:15:51] <Kottizen> I see, thank you! :)

[13:34:31] <xpe> has anyone ever tried to receive raw image data, base64 encode it and use it as image src with a data uri? I tried to, but the window.btoa function to base64 encode the data results in an InvalidCharacterError. Any ideas?
[13:41:37] <wongon> chovy: it doesn't seem to work with a div in the body.
[13:42:36] <wongon> in fact, jQuery('#id); and jQuery('#id').append('blah'); gives back a {...} of stuff, and the append does not work
[13:43:12] <wongon> this is in ie9's console window.
[13:44:07] <d4rklit3> hey in jqui sortable, i have some flash objects. it seems that the jqui is intercepting the click i put on them? is there a workaround for this?
[13:47:15] <d4rklit3> the flash clicks is using filerefernce so the user MUST click on it
[13:53:52] <d4rklit3> isnt there some way to make some object inside a sortable cancel the drag

[15:45:48] <benlieb> This line $('.gets_spinning_wheel').live('click', function() is producing this error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'live' . I'm upgrading a siteâ€¦ is live() a jQuery method?
[15:53:46] <benlieb> seems to be because of the upgrade from 1.7 to 1.9.
[16:05:42] <shoky> benlieb: yea live() is old and has been deprecated for a long time, removed in 1.9
[16:06:02] <benlieb> what should I replace it with?
[16:06:12] <benlieb> on() or bind() or delegate()
[16:06:36] <shoky> on() or delegate()  but its not just simply replacing the method name
[16:06:51] <shoky> read about it here
[16:06:55] <shoky> ?live @ benlieb
[16:06:55] <b-ot> benlieb: deprecated
[16:06:55] <bot-t> benlieb, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:07:40] <benlieb> shoky: I need to keep the "in the future" part.
[16:07:53] <benlieb> shoky: still not sure exactly how to do that...
[16:08:07] <shoky> benlieb: read about it here http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:08:22] <benlieb> shoky: been reading that for the last 20 mins...
[16:08:53] <shoky> ok..  $(document).on('click', '.gets_spinning_wheel', function(){...})
[16:09:00] <shoky> that would mimic .live()
[16:09:29] <benlieb> shoky: ok, that's what I wasn't sure about. tnx.
[16:10:17] <shoky> how hard is it to understand  $(selector).live(events, data, handler);  -->  $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);
[16:12:02] <Caelum> shoky: hi! I got it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/bbmdW/2/ https://github.com/rkitover/load-js
[16:12:36] <benlieb> actually this is more direct:   $('.gets_spinning_wheel').on('click', function() {
[16:13:36] <shoky> benlieb: that is different and is the same as .bind
[16:14:08] <shoky> hi Caelum
[16:16:55] <hugo_moss> shoky, can you help me understand something.  now when you have a script tag that includes the latest jquery version, and then another script tag that is executed in some callback, or event that fires it, and then you have another jquery script tag inserted after that. i dont understand what jquery version it would use, or how the javascript would load and execute?
[16:17:02] <relipse> any of you mysql guys see a problem with this? http://paste.ee/r/kUgSU - execute() is returning false for some reason but errorInfo() is empty
[16:17:42] <Caelum> hugo_moss: you don't want to load jquery twice
[16:17:50] <benlieb> shoky: i see. that's kind of not obvious. I guess you have to attach the on() to something higher up the tree for 'new' elements to get that functionality.
[16:17:52] <hugo_moss> right
[16:17:52] <Caelum> hugo_moss: anything linked to $ gets wiped out
[16:18:01] <hugo_moss> im just trying to understand what would happen exactly
[16:18:04] <hugo_moss> out of curiousity
[16:18:17] <shoky> benlieb: what matters is if you pass a selector as 2nd argument to .on or not
[16:18:23] <hugo_moss> what do you mean?
[16:18:25] <Caelum> hugo_moss: also for jquery.min.js for 1.9.0, if you load it twice the source map breaks IE
[16:19:13] <hugo_moss> can you explain
[16:19:42] <Caelum> hugo_moss: e.g., jquery-ui gets installed into jQuery.ui, if you do this: load jqueryu, load -ui, load jquery a second time, the second jquery load overwrites jQuery and there's no more jQuery.ui
[16:20:20] <Caelum> hugo_moss: the source map thing I don't really understand myself, but switching to jquery.js "fixed" it
[16:20:39] <Caelum> hugo_moss: I wrote this to deal with this problem: https://github.com/rkitover/load-js
[16:23:06] <svcghost> Hey guys
[16:23:48] <svcghost> How would I most easily check if any input / select / etc. of a form gets clicked or focus
[16:24:13] <svcghost> I want to be able to do it using the form ID instead of having to check each individual input element gets focus
[16:27:33] <shoky> $('#myform').on('focusin', ':input', function(e) { ... })
[16:28:44] <bambu> This really doesn't work as
[16:29:00] <bambu> I expected it to: http://bambuseae.org/index.html  anyone notice why?
[16:29:58] <speakingcode-wor> i'm tryingt o send a json object as extra payload data in a POST request using $.post()... call looks like... $.post('/api/prl_processor/' + type, { bsids: [120, 119] }, function(data) {
[16:31:11] <speakingcode-wor> the problem i'm having is the post request ends up having multiple params... bsids[] 120, bsids[]] 119. and the api i'm hitting returns back an error that it can't parse it (as json)... bsids%5B%5D=120&bsids%5B%5D=119
[16:31:46] <bambu> oh lol
[16:31:49] <speakingcode-wor> why is it enumerating the values in the array in the json object i'm sending in the request
[16:32:17] <speakingcode-wor> or rather, how can i make it not? :-\
[16:33:06] <bambu> It's a little sketchy  still, if anyone wants to look: bambuseae.org bambuseae.org/main.js
[16:33:11] <speakingcode-wor> when i make the request with curl, all is fine... curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"bids" : [120, 119] }' localhost:9292/api/prl_processor/bid
[16:33:19] <bambu> It's a little sketchy  still, if anyone wants to look: http:/bambuseae.org http://bambuseae.org/main.js
[16:33:22] <shoky> speakingcode-wor:  JSON.stringify the data object
[16:33:36] <speakingcode-wor> shoky thanks, i'll try it
[16:33:44] <shoky> speakingcode-wor: or the part you want as JSON
[16:34:18] <speakingcode-wor> worked. thanks.
[16:36:03] <daftspunk> is it possible to set request headers using $.post? (setRequestHeader)
[16:36:53] <shoky> bambu you should put the fadeIn  inside the .load() callback
[16:37:01] <speakingcode-wor> you can pass an object as the data field daftspunk
[16:37:08] <speakingcode-wor> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[16:37:47] <daftspunk> i think i need the beforeSend event which has the request object i need
[16:37:57] <shoky> daftspunk use $.ajax for full customization of a single request
[16:38:20] <shoky> dont think you can set any headers with $.post alone
[16:38:22] <daftspunk> shoky: thanks , im gonna try ajaxSettings
[16:38:33] <shoky> that might work too ya
[16:38:45] <daftspunk> sending custom headers defeats the purpose of $.post (elegant/simple)  :)
[16:38:53] <daftspunk> just thought i'd ask!
[16:39:06] <bambu> shoky: Jquery makes it simple, I gotta remember its helping me :)
[16:39:09] <bambu> Thank you
[16:39:26] <phishy> What's a general term for what happens when for example, a modal appears, and the rest of the screen fades to grey to indicate where to interact?
[16:39:57] <phishy> Oh i Just remembered what i wanted, http://jquery.malsup.com/block/
[16:42:22] <phishy> Hm, maybe there's something less ugly..
[16:42:25] <speakingcode-wor> phishy: overlay?
[16:42:48] <phishy> speakingcode-wor, yeah kinda, specifically to block user interaction and contain it to a particular element
[16:42:57] <phishy> was wondering if there was some jargon for it
[16:43:12] <speakingcode-wor> well i guess it's not an overlay unless it's z value is above the rest of the stuff and it actually lays over the rest, hehe
[16:43:31] <speakingcode-wor> maybe focus or something, but i'm no designer so i dunno
[16:43:43] <shoky> block user interaction and contain it to a particular element === modal
[16:44:56] <shoky> modal as in modes, as in "now we're in the dialog mode"
[16:46:15] <bambu> This may not be a question to ask here, but is there anyway to keep the page from making a real reload, I thought bind(window,'statechange',function() would do that.
[16:46:37] <disappearedng> I have a queue of pictures. Any recommendations for a plugin that allows me to display one picture at a time and I can go forward and backward with it with callbacks?
[16:47:05] <shoky> bambu your page isn't doing a real reload. because of the "return false" in your click handler
[16:47:27] <bambu> shoky: I mean for when someone presses f5 or clicks refresh.
[16:47:38] <shoky> bambu: that means they want a real refresh
[16:48:00] <bambu> So 'statechange' doesn't handle refresh?
[16:48:08] <shoky> and you ain't gonna stop em, cause that would be super dumb
[16:48:38] <bambu> shoky: More importantly, when someone directly visits about.html
[16:49:08] <phishy> shoky, yeah except i'm not displaying a model, i'm freezing user interaction while a date picker is up
[16:49:23] <shoky> phishy: modal date-picker, then ;p
[16:49:34] <phishy> shoky, oh you're fresh
[16:49:40] <shoky> lol
[17:32:12] <svcghost> Can anyone explain why     $('#firstname').focus(function() {
[17:32:12] <svcghost> 		alert('focus has been gained');
[17:32:13] <svcghost> 	});            causes infinite amount of alerts?
[17:36:51] <shoky> svcghost: the alert causes blur, then closing the alert causes a re-focus, and so on.
[18:01:30] <svcghost> thanks shoky
[18:01:34] <svcghost> I caught on eventually haha
[18:02:01] <svcghost> Hey, in this code    $('[id^=color][value=0]').length     what are the inner bracket elements called?
[18:02:17] <svcghost> I want to look this method up and find what other things u can filter on, not just id and value
[18:02:37] <svcghost> But I don't know what to call it in my search
[18:04:42] <jost> svcghost, these things are called 'predicates', at least in XPath
[18:07:56] <svcghost> thanks man
[18:09:18] <codezombie> I've got a loop that does a series of synchronous ajax calls. However, only the success/complete callbacks of the last request seem to fire. Is there a reason for that, or should I be looking for bad code?
[18:27:25] <someprimetime> make them asynchronous
[18:36:36] <Caelum> codezombie: if you're making synchronous calls, you don't need callbacks, you can just check the return of .ajax
[18:38:57] <Caelum> actually I'm not sure you can
[18:40:40] <Whirl3d_> Good evenin' all. Would someone mind telling me why I am unable to register click events on my li elements?
[18:40:46] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/7Tx5D/
[18:41:10] <Whirl3d_> sorry, I mean http://jsfiddle.net/7Tx5D/2/
[18:42:29] <crazyzurfer> hi guys... i've got a problem... I've got a select with options inside each option has a value (a number) and then the text, like this <option value="1">John</option> is there a way to get "john" inside another input (text)?
[18:44:13] <Whirl3d_> I miss the old jsfiddle.
[18:45:12] <Whirl3d_> crazysurfer, you mean you want the text of the current selected option?
[18:45:47] <crazyzurfer> yep
[18:46:06] <crazyzurfer> whirl3d: .val() doesn't work because it gives me the number (value), not the text
[18:46:17] <Whirl3d_> var val=$("select").find("option:selected").text();
[18:46:50] <Whirl3d_> it may not be selected....I'm a bit rusty. Get the .text() value of the option selected
[18:48:11] <crazyzurfer> :Whirl3d_: It works just great!, thanks!
[18:49:24] <Whirl3d_> np
[18:50:17] <Whirl3d_> I tell you what, the single best thing about taking a break from programming is that when you return, everything seems much clearer than before. I'm amazed at my age that I can still remember anything...
[18:51:52] <Whirl3d_> So I guess all the big kids grew up and have social lives now instead of just manning #jquery and saving the world...hmmpf
[18:52:59] <Caelum> Whirl3d_: if I remove your css the click handler works
[18:53:11] <Caelum> Whirl3d_: so something in your css is screwing it up
[18:53:17] <Whirl3d_> I was just doing that. lol...I hate css
[18:53:26] <Whirl3d_> thanks for your help. I should've done that first.
[18:54:07] <Caelum> social lives are highly overrated
[18:54:33] <Caelum> I'd rather talk to other geeks on irc than discuss the weather or the latest dumb movie
[18:55:28] <Caelum> though we end up doing that on irc anyway
[18:55:43] <Whirl3d_> it has been nice out lately. LOL
[18:55:51] <Caelum> heh
[18:56:29] <Whirl3d_> so it's something with my first class.
[18:56:57] <Whirl3d_> z-index....
[19:24:09] <guide_X> any idea why this wouldn't work? <a href="#guide1" rel="prettyPhoto" title="guide 1"><img id='guide1' alt='' src='guide1.jpg' /></a>
[19:24:28] <guide_X> and by not work I mean, nothing happens except what looks like a postback, then i'm on the same page
[19:24:46] <guide_X> i've included the prettyPhoto.js and .css
[19:24:52] <guide_X> and there's no javascript error
[19:25:47] <guide_X> oh wait it's not a postback
[19:25:52] <guide_X> the page just moves up a little
[19:26:56] <Whirl3d_> guide_X, did you initialize the pretty photo?
[19:28:25] <Whirl3d_> It sounds like your anchor element is trying to scroll your content to the #guide1 target element (which is the default behavior for an anchor in that context). Once you initialize pretty photo, it likely modifies that behavior
[19:28:43] <guide_X> hmm
[19:28:46] <guide_X> I did not initialize it
[19:28:52] <guide_X> that must be the problem
[19:30:16] <Whirl3d_> So at the head of your document, include a script tag and something like this: $("document").ready(function () { $(".photoHolder").prettyPhoto();});   or something like that. You'll have to read the plugins documentation to get the exact syntax
[19:30:42] <Whirl3d_> but it has to be done in a $(document).ready(funciton ()  { init code here });  after jquery and the plugin load.
[19:31:41] <hugo_moss> why is it that if you go to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js and inspect it in chrome inspector, and look at the file, the code is cut off?
[19:32:08] <guide_X> cool
[19:32:12] <guide_X> i'm working on that now thanks :)
[19:32:19] <guide_X> it;'s not working yet, but it probably will
[19:32:29] <greg5green> hugo_moss, chrome just doesnt want to display that much text
[19:32:39] <greg5green> if you right click and hit edit as html, you can see all the code is still there
[19:32:56] <greg5green> a better question, why would you ask this?
[19:33:17] <hugo_moss> its complaining that there is no .on method in jquery 1.8.3
[19:33:23] <Es0teric> i have this -> http://pastie.org/private/lldgdtfa5ei8hnr61iklnq and i want to add a .song class to the <li> how do i accomplish that? because append($(<li>).addClass('song')) is not adding the class
[19:33:45] <Whirl3d_> $("li").addClass("song");
[19:33:47] <greg5green> then you arent loading something right
[19:34:12] <Es0teric> Whirl3d_ but what if i have more than one list item on the page?
[19:34:17] <hugo_moss> hmm yea
[19:34:18] <Es0teric> as in more than one ul
[19:34:24] <hugo_moss> hmm
[19:34:37] <Whirl3d_> Es0teric, you have to find the li that you want. then .addClass("song");
[19:34:44] <greg5green> also, you should be loading it from http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js
[19:34:59] <Whirl3d_> how do you decide which li gets the song class?
[19:35:10] <guide_X> Whirl3d, can I show you code?
[19:35:25] <guide_X> I get no errors, but it still doesn't work, now the browser "thinks" for a sec
[19:35:25] <Es0teric> Whirl3d_ i can just do $('ul.someclass').find('li').addClass('song'); correct?
[19:35:31] <Whirl3d_> I don't know pretty photo, but if you paste it to jsfiddle, I could look at it.
[19:35:37] <guide_X> ok 1 sec
[19:36:02] <Whirl3d_> Es0teric, if you want to add it to all li in ul.someclass
[19:36:15] <Es0teric> Whirl3d_ yes thats what i want to do
[19:36:22] <Whirl3d_> should work for ya
[19:36:57] <hugo_moss> greg5green: why
[19:37:13] <guide_X> www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39063
[19:37:37] <hugo_moss> greg5green: if i sort the loading of all the resources by end time, does that show the execution order of the scripts?
[19:37:41] <Es0teric> lol Whirl3d_ i've been doing it to the wrong file... i just realized now why it is not working
[19:37:51] <Whirl3d_> guide_X that's not jquery...or even js
[19:38:06] <Es0teric> damn i feel stupid as hell right now
[19:38:36] <guide_X> well the code is pretty short
[19:38:38] <greg5green> hugo_moss, <Script> tags load sequentially and synchronously, so as long as you list the jquery.min.js before your scripts that use the .on method, it will be ready by the time you call .on
[19:38:49] <guide_X> I haven't actually looked at the prettyphoto jquery
[19:39:24] <Whirl3d_> guide_X, I can help you with the jquery part, but I don't know C# at all
[19:39:44] <hugo_moss> then im at a loss
[19:39:45] <guide_X> oh maybe i gave you the wrong link
[19:39:48] <hugo_moss> i dont know whats goin on here
[19:40:02] <hugo_moss> because thats what im doing, yet its complaining that there is no .on method
[19:40:10] <guide_X> oh sorry I gacve you the wrong link
[19:40:14] <guide_X> I don't know how that happened
[19:40:27] <greg5green> hugo_moss, is it live
[19:40:28] <greg5green> ?
[19:40:33] <hugo_moss> yea
[19:40:35] <guide_X> www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39065
[19:40:38] <guide_X> sorry about that :)
[19:40:49] <guide_X> my clipboard rewrote my url for me heh
[19:41:03] <guide_X> clipboard url rewriting
[19:41:27] <Whirl3d_> guide_X, do you have jquery loaded ?
[19:41:33] <guide_X> yeah
[19:41:38] <guide_X> jquery is working
[19:42:13] <guide_X> I just get a browser movement, like something is about to load
[19:42:19] <guide_X> but then nothing happens
[19:42:28] <hugo_moss> however greg, there in the body tag before the closing
[19:42:28] <Whirl3d_> then I am afraid this is a pretty photo thing...
[19:42:36] <hugo_moss> that might have something to do with it?
[19:42:40] <guide_X> hmm ok
[19:42:47] <guide_X> well thanks for looking ;)
[19:43:20] <guide_X> - evil
[19:44:00] <Whirl3d_> it looks from the pretty photo docs like you are doing it right.
[19:45:03] <guide_X> the funny thing is, on another page with the same jquery/prettyphoto, it works
[19:45:13] <guide_X> and when I delete everything else on this page, it doesn't work
[19:45:16] <Whirl3d_> I would do this:  inside your docready, do:   var photos=$("a").filter(function () {return $(this).attr("rel")=="prettyPhoto"?$(this):null;}); console.log(photos.length);
[19:45:25] <guide_X> ok cool 1 sec
[19:46:51] <Whirl3d_> and it looks like your #href has to be pointed at the fullsize image url for pretty photo to work.
[19:46:58] <guide_X> it says 10
[19:47:03] <greg5green> hugo_moss, im looking at it now, playing around with breakpoints real quick
[19:47:26] <hugo_moss> now, i know its because of the multiple jquery libraries
[19:47:28] <guide_X> so it's picking up the images..
[19:47:34] <hugo_moss> because i didnt have them in there before
[19:47:41] <hugo_moss> but out of curiousity i was testing something
[19:47:48] <Whirl3d_> sure. Now, you have to change the href from #guide1 to wherever the full size image is
[19:48:00] <guide_X> ok let me try that
[19:48:05] <hugo_moss> i wanted to know what jquery library would be used if i included all of those
[19:48:23] <hugo_moss> and i had console.log with $.fn.jquery, telling me what version was being called
[19:48:45] <guide_X> same thing
[19:48:57] <hugo_moss> but from my understanding, it will basically use the overwritten version of jquery
[19:49:18] <Whirl3d_> Yeah then I would say triy an older version of jquery?? I don't know. It seems like you are doing it all correctly.
[19:49:49] <guide_X> pretty strange indeed, well thanks :)
[19:53:15] <greg5green> wait
[19:53:18] <hugo_moss> its pretty weird
[19:53:22] <greg5green> you out here loading multiple jqueries
[19:53:32] <greg5green> and got me going thru your code with breakpoints trying to figure out where it breaks?
[19:53:33] <hugo_moss> yea just to see what happens
[19:53:34] <greg5green> ugh
[19:53:46] <hugo_moss> im curious
[19:53:58] <hugo_moss> can you explain
[19:54:13] <greg5green> 1.4.2 doesn't have .on
[19:54:28] <hugo_moss> but why does that overwrite jquery1.8.3?
[19:54:44] <hugo_moss> isn't the on binding firing before 1.4.2 is added?
[19:54:48] <greg5green> you are also loading 1.7.2
[19:54:53] <hugo_moss> yea
[19:54:57] <nesoi> so in jquery mobile, is there a recommended way to speed up something like displaying a list of 2000 items with a listview? It seems to take about 1 second per 100 items on my phone.
[19:55:04] <hugo_moss> on was added in 1.7
[19:55:06] <greg5green> your jcarousel is loading 1.4.2 after you load 1.8.3
[19:55:23] <hugo_moss> how do you know the execution order?
[19:55:39] <greg5green> because im looking in the network tab and seeing it is loaded after you load 1.7.2 and 1.8.3
[19:55:59] <hugo_moss> what sort are you using? by end time?
[19:56:55] <hugo_moss> oh shit
[19:56:58] <hugo_moss> i wasnt thinking
[19:57:29] <hugo_moss> i didnt realize the call to document.onready was firing after executing the scripts
[19:57:41] <hugo_moss> thats why its using 1.4.2
[19:57:43] <hugo_moss> my bad
[19:57:58] <hugo_moss> thanks greg
[19:57:59] <greg5green> you i hadnt worked back for enough to get to that
[19:58:10] <greg5green> but i just found that out with the default chrome network tab
[19:58:16] <greg5green> where it shows what order stuff loads in
[19:58:27] <greg5green> unless your stuff won't work with a newer version, just use the newer version
[19:58:31] <greg5green> don't load more than one version
[19:58:35] <hugo_moss> yea
[19:58:37] <greg5green> its too much extra weight to deal with it
[19:58:42] <hugo_moss> no i was just wondering what would happen
[19:58:43] <greg5green> kB weight
[19:59:02] <hugo_moss> i even had this answered on SO
[19:59:07] <hugo_moss> and he said the same thing you did
[19:59:18] <hugo_moss> but ive been on the computer the whole day, i need a break
[19:59:30] <greg5green> you're killing me, smalls
[19:59:33] <hugo_moss> im like zoning out
[20:00:14] <nesoi> no one here is familiar with a jquery mobile listview?
[20:01:04] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14532481/what-happens-if-you-include-three-versions-of-jquery-and-have-a-script-included
[20:01:29] <hugo_moss> lol that was SO question answered, and i accepted the answer hours ago
[20:01:48] <hugo_moss> i think the radiation is gettin to me
[20:02:00] <greg5green> :>
[20:02:40] <dblosevn> amh
[20:02:44] <dblosevn> grr
[20:08:45] <Whirl3d_> is there any way to constrain motion in jqueryUI sortable to vertical only?
[20:12:06] <codepython777> how hard is it to make this: http://www.dpreview.com/galleries/736212358/photos/slideshow?start=4 ?
[20:12:13] <codepython777> anyone has any pointers for me to get started?
[20:12:21] <codepython777> perhaps a plugin similar to this
[20:12:55] <codepython777> oh! Its done in flash. not JS. unfortunately.
[20:14:29] <codepython777> any ideas on how to do this?
[20:17:17] <kerozene> codepython777: http://galleria.io/themes/azur/
[20:20:16] <codepython777> kerozene: just mising a few buttons
[20:20:23] <codepython777> kerozene: is this free open source code?
[20:20:38] <kerozene> no. but it's just one of a zillion options you have
[20:20:48] <kerozene> and I don't know anything about any of them
[20:21:50] <codepython777> kerozene: looks good, thanks for the pointer
[20:21:57] <kerozene> np
[20:22:32] <nesoi> so in jquery, when you append to to dom, is it faster if you append a bunch of stuff at once rather than multiple append operations?
[20:22:36] <codepython777> kerozene: what others could / should i look at? I'm looking at bsd/mit licensed code.
[20:22:49] <kerozene> no idea
[20:26:53] <xxx> #webdesign
[20:31:27] <thisboy> hey what do u call the opposite of mobile?
[20:31:34] <thisboy> desktop and pc just doesn't sound right
[20:31:57] <kerozene> immobile
[20:31:59] <thisboy> i.e. "we have one mobile version and one ??? version"
[20:32:02] <thisboy> hehe
[20:32:12] <thisboy> :D
[20:32:51] <thisboy> kerozene: really?
[20:33:36] <kerozene> not really
[20:33:44] <thisboy> lol
[20:33:53] <thisboy> well its the best one ive seen so far
[20:34:29] <greg5green> desktop is the current vernacular
[20:34:52] <greg5green> if you have an interface for tvs, you could throw  and one for "ten foot interfaces"
[20:35:27] <thisboy> cool yeah i guess ill just keep calling it desktop then
[20:35:36] <thisboy> never considered tv interfaces before
[20:35:40] <thisboy> thanks for the heads up greg
[20:38:36] <thisboy> greg5green: i guess a tv interface would be just like the desktop interface except it supports split screen so u can watch the telly while u browse?
[20:39:00] <greg5green> no, the text is bigger
[20:39:09] <greg5green> so you can read it from ten feet away
[20:39:12] <thisboy> oooh yeah
[20:39:20] <greg5green> 16pt text is hard to read on 1080p tvs from 10 feet away
[20:39:27] <thisboy> :D
[20:39:33] <greg5green> so its kind of like mobile, but BLOWN UP :D
[20:39:39] <thisboy> my god
[20:39:42] <thisboy> that is brilliant greg5green
[20:40:31] <relipse> i have an input box and i'm using ajax to check if username is available, how can i use css to show a green checkbox in the right-hand side of the input i guess using background-image() ?
[20:52:30] <linda> how to implement pagenation  for slideshow which is auto-advanced?
[21:28:18] <dblosevn> relipse: ya background-image, background-repeat and backgournd-postion would work you could also just float a span to the right of it
[22:15:30] <halfie> hi, I am getting "TypeError: this._hoverable is not a function
[22:15:30] <halfie> http://127.0.0.1:8000/site_media/ui/jquery.ui.button.js
[22:16:49] <halfie> I am using stable version of jquery ui, 1.10.0
[22:17:33] <kerozene> http://127.0.0.1/ <3
[22:17:41] <dblosevn> halfie: how is pasting us a link to localhost going to do anything for us?
[22:17:56] <Whirl3d_> halfie, whenever you have an ip address that is 127.n.n.n it's not accessible from the internet
[22:18:32] <Whirl3d_> Those numbers are reserved for local use only. So on your network, you can test it. But outside of your gateway, no luck.
[22:18:59] <dblosevn> watch next he will paste 192.168.1.101:8000 lmao
[22:19:15] <kerozene> also, linking to the plugin without the context of where it is in use is of dubious benefit
[22:20:01] <dblosevn> man i passed out last night while i was doing something pretty cool for amh345 got done with it too lol
[22:20:29] <dblosevn> http://techbydoug.org/ :-)
[22:21:13] <halfie> yea, I know that. My paste buffer was messed up. sorry about that
[22:21:15] <Whirl3d_> yes?
[22:21:41] <dblosevn> reverse mask over a video using gd
[22:22:18] <dblosevn> to render html on with transparent text on a black background
[22:22:24] <Whirl3d_> Your demo needs to have something happening in the foreground. Right now it looks like a black png with transparency over a view
[22:22:37] <kerozene> dblosevn: I'm seeing bad aliasing. png problem or video issue?
[22:22:45] <dblosevn> bad font choice
[22:22:46] <kerozene> +anti-
[22:23:11] <dblosevn> i hade issues targeting the shading on the edges to make it transpent
[22:23:17] <dblosevn> *transparent
[22:23:47] <Whirl3d_> so you are saying that I could type anything and you could make it reverse mask.
[22:23:52] <dblosevn> ya
[22:24:03] <kerozene> but the png's alpha pixels should just overlay smoothly, no?
[22:24:14] <dblosevn> http://techbydoug.org/get.php?html=THIS%20IS%20HTML%20%3Cbr/%3ETHIS%20IS%20HTML%20%3Cbr%3ETHIS%20IS%20HTML%20%3Cbr%3ETHIS%20IS%20HTML%20%3Cbr%3ETHIS%20IS%20HTML%20%3Cbr%3ETHIS%20IS%20HTML%20%3Cbr%3E&width=800&height=600
[22:24:23] <kerozene> makes me think the browser can't blend it with the video
[22:24:31] <Whirl3d_> That's impressive.
[22:24:34] <dblosevn> no the image really looks like that
[22:24:56] <kerozene> ah. are you using gd?
[22:25:00] <dblosevn> i need to find a ttf that uses block letters with smooth edges and no shading
[22:25:04] <dblosevn> ya
[22:25:11] <kerozene> tried imagick?
[22:25:21] <dblosevn> dont have it installed on this box
[22:25:32] <kerozene> might be smoother. I can't quite remember
[22:26:08] <dblosevn> was just a quick throw together if i actually needed it for something id clean it up lol
[22:26:18] <dblosevn> was just liek 20 mins of goofing off
[22:26:44] <dblosevn> i really couldnt figure out how to make the text transparent on a black background
[22:27:08] <dblosevn> so i made black text on a transparent canvas and inverted it
[22:27:51] <dblosevn> maybe enabling alpha transparency might clean it up a bit
[22:32:31] <halfie> I am trying out http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/dialog/modal-form.html example. Sometimes the form fields which should be displayed in modal window are displayed *briefly* in the base page itself when loading. Any tips to fix this?
[22:33:04] <dblosevn> wrasp it in a div with display:none
[22:33:08] <dblosevn> *wrap even
[22:33:31] <dblosevn> do it inline though so it doesnt rely on the stylesheet to be loaded
[22:33:54] <halfie> dblosevn: tried that, then the modal windows doesn't have any fields!
[22:34:01] <dblosevn> ya it will
[22:34:15] <dblosevn> put the wrapper around the entire modal black
[22:34:26] <dblosevn> not inside of the modal block
[22:34:55] <dblosevn> eg... <div style="display:none;"><div id="modal">.......</div></div>
[22:35:23] <halfie> dblosevn: thanks, it works!
[22:35:32] <dblosevn> :-)
[22:37:16] <Whirl3d_> so jqueryUI doesn't allow constraining for the sortable method?
[22:38:13] <dblosevn> of course it does
[22:38:33] <dblosevn> sortables are already contrained to there list
[22:38:35] <Whirl3d_> I just read 4 stack overflows that said it doesn't. Google is not my friend
[22:38:49] <Whirl3d_> But I can drag my sortable all across the screen
[22:38:59] <dblosevn> you have to make them sortable/draggable to drag between lists
[22:39:00] <Whirl3d_> I need it to only drag up and down
[22:39:10] <Whirl3d_> I want them inside one list
[22:39:24] <dblosevn> you cant drop them anywhere else on the page
[22:39:36] <dblosevn> you can drag them around the page though outside the list
[22:39:47] <Whirl3d_> yup
[22:39:48] <dblosevn> but they will reset to the last position when dropped
[22:40:25] <dblosevn> make it a sortable/draggable with contraint to the list
[22:40:32] <dblosevn> should kill that behavior
[22:40:57] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/7Tx5D/19/
[22:41:11] <dblosevn> be warned though its a bitch to drag something to the top or bottom of the list when you do that
[22:41:35] <Whirl3d_> apply focus to the subtitle block and grab the yellow handle and you'll see what I am talking about.. it looks goofy to drag it all around
[22:42:34] <Whirl3d_> on the yellow handle, I will have up and down arrows to move up one or down one, but the dragging has to stay vertical...So I will try it with sortable/draggable. Thanks.
[22:48:19] <Whirl3d_> Yeah it appears that it is either sortable or draggable.
[22:49:00] <Whirl3d_> wait. I have to make the indivual pieces draggable and their ul sortable.
[22:52:54] <Whirl3d_> even worse. I'm going to write my own .sortable and rely on the constrain parts of draggable.
[22:56:29] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/F75Wc/
[22:56:53] <dblosevn> that seems to work
[22:57:12] <Whirl3d_> not the sortable part. Just the draggable part
[22:57:32] <dblosevn> it sorts and wont let it leave its parent when sdragging
[22:57:46] <dblosevn> thought that was the goal here?
[22:58:58] <Whirl3d_> Actually all of the elements should only drag up or down and should remain within their parent element. So any ul li ul li elements stay within thieir parent
[22:59:15] <dblosevn> thats what its doing
[22:59:32] <dblosevn> i waas scared when i noticed it wasnt allowing you to drag between lists
[22:59:37] <Whirl3d_> There is never an instance where two fields can overlap. period.
[22:59:51] <Whirl3d_> except while dragging
[22:59:53] <dblosevn> lol but if thats the desired behavior then thats good
[23:00:10] <Whirl3d_> on your fiddle,  you can drop the fields on top of each other
[23:00:23] <Whirl3d_> and drag them left to right about 2 em
[23:00:42] <dblosevn> well the parent is wider then the li so you can drag left and right
[23:01:07] <Whirl3d_> Right. unles syou constrain the draggable to y-axis then it drags perfectly.
[23:01:23] <Whirl3d_> But then it doesn't fire the sortable()
[23:02:25] <Whirl3d_> dblosevn, I really appreciate your help, btw. If I sound combattive, it's just cause I am frustrated. Don't mistake it for a lack of grattitude, please.
[23:02:27] <dblosevn> which is weird the docs clearly say that draggable is compatible with sortable
[23:02:39] <dblosevn> and ive done it before
[23:02:50] <dblosevn> i combined a draggable/droppable/sortable
[23:02:52] <Whirl3d_> Must be something I am doing wrong. Probably with css
[23:04:01] <dblosevn> http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/product-type.php?tmpadmin=true
[23:04:19] <dblosevn> thats a draggable/droppable/sortable
[23:04:42] <dblosevn> can drag from the left list drop to the right list as well as sort
[23:04:49] <Whirl3d_> That's just what I want.
[23:05:20] <c00lways> hi, anyone encounter issue with mobile for jquery.load? it shows filename instead of the file
[23:05:25] <dblosevn> feel free to pown my code :-)
[23:05:55] <dblosevn> havent had time to finish this site yet
[23:06:08] <Whirl3d_> I love the fact that you used the right click to delete!
[23:06:41] <dblosevn> doing it for a buddy of mine kind of a pro bono type project so it ets work when i have time
[23:07:05] <dblosevn> everything uses ajax as well
[23:07:25] <dblosevn> and blockui for the loading
[23:07:28] <c00lways> its really weird that jquery.load stop working for all local files, and its showing "filename.html" instead of actual file content
[23:08:40] <dblosevn> thing i had the most issue with was making the pane on the right scroll with the page
[23:09:04] <nights`> more like a js or html5 question, but ... anyone knows a way to autoplay audio on safari or mercury on iOS6? :S
[23:09:39] <Whirl3d_> which pane on the right?
[23:09:48] <dblosevn> ?g html5 mp3 autoplay
[23:09:49] <bot-t> dblosevn, HTML5 audio autoplay Attribute - http://www.w3schools.com/html5/att_audio_autoplay.asp
[23:09:50] <Whirl3d_> Oh I see
[23:11:17] <dblosevn> that was the best i could come up with for shared meta keys
[23:11:50] <dblosevn> oh didnt see ios6 im scared to upgrade so i dont know
[23:12:33] <dblosevn> not positive i wont eventually want to jailbreak my device
[23:13:21] <dblosevn> oh thats something else they just passed a law to make it illegal to unlock or jailbreak a phone
[23:13:33] <dblosevn> effective in less then 30 days
[23:13:52] <Whirl3d_> Why do you handle everything ajax as opposed to getting your fields how you wan them and getting a confirmation then posting?
[23:14:58] <dblosevn> never really thought about it, it was super easy to hook into the actions and post with ajax
[23:17:09] <relipse> can someone please help me, i used mp3splt to split a 56 minute mp3 into 5 minute segments, but for some reason infrarecorder says inappropriate audio coding and it won't burn to audio cd, how do i make sure the mp3 files are converted to a valid cd format wav?
[23:21:03] <dblosevn> mp3 shouldnt have an issue at all being ripped to cda
[23:23:06] <dblosevn> the mp3s might be at a weird bitrate or something
[23:23:37] <dblosevn> or the metadata might be jacked
[23:24:14] <dblosevn> id just use lame to do it
[23:46:25] <djQuery> hey Whirl3d_  long tim
[23:46:34] <djQuery> e
[23:47:30] <djQuery> relipse, or this might not be related to jquery at all
[23:53:32] <djQuery> I see how it is I get here and everything stops
