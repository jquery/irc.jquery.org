[00:08:48] <axscode> http://pastebin.com/L59vgmpJ <-- hi guys, i was wondering how can i define this that it will only effect  on div with class="selection" or class="node-story" ? because right now its now working global.
[00:18:41] <aro> is there a jquery function for when a form field is auto filled?
[00:18:51] <aro> either using form field history, or browser auto fill
[01:35:25] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/KXnv7/27/
[01:36:09] <joshualibrarian> clicking on the red div should make the blue div black... the alert shows it's instance has the wrong data somehow.
[01:42:21] <red_square> your missing the declaration of self
[01:42:25] <red_square> so its a global var
[01:42:41] <red_square> joshualibrarian ^^
[01:43:18] <gloomer> nice catch :)
[01:43:42] <joshualibrarian> red_square: oh, much better!  good eye.  okay, now I can get this fiddle to the actual problem I'm trying to represent!  ;)
[01:46:00] <TurboDumper> i have a <p> tag inside a div,on each div i have a function $("div").click(
[01:46:00] <TurboDumper>         function (evt)
[01:47:31] <TurboDumper> i'm trying to change the background of the p to red $(this).css("background-color", "red"); works but $(this).children(p).css("background-color", "red"); doesn't
[01:47:37] <TurboDumper> anyone an idea?
[01:48:12] <red_square> TurboDumper children means the first child only
[01:48:28] <red_square> it takes a selector but you dont need it - and it needs to be in quotes
[01:49:53] <TurboDumper> when i try $(this).children(); it returns an empty array
[01:50:26] <red_square> paste your markup
[01:50:31] <red_square> or do a jsfiddle
[01:50:37] <TurboDumper> ok thx
[01:55:29] <TurboDumper> http://jsfiddle.net/YSbJ7/
[01:55:35] <TurboDumper> it's in mvc3
[01:57:51] <red_square> can you not put a css classname on the div
[01:58:00] <red_square> move all the inline style into it
[01:58:33] <red_square> $("div[style]") is an odd slow selector
[01:59:35] <TurboDumper> just $("div")
[01:59:45] <red_square> well div.className
[01:59:57] <red_square> i assume u have other divs on the page
[02:00:01] <TurboDumper> yes
[02:00:13] <red_square> so you dont want to select them also
[02:00:41] <TurboDumper> i'm trying to build a cms each page contains different divs for the zones
[02:01:35] <TurboDumper> each div for the zone has a different classname
[02:03:39] <TurboDumper> i could select the divs of the container page div
[02:04:54] <red_square> well I would use the container and use .on
[02:05:14] <red_square> ? .on @TurboDumper
[02:05:30] <red_square> ah no bot
[02:05:56] <someprimetime> yeah where has bot-t been lately
[02:06:08] <red_square> http://api.jquery.com/on/ @ TurboDumper
[02:06:10] <someprimetime> it was actually someone typing earlier from the acct
[02:06:44] <red_square> temp01 turned his machine off
[02:07:51] <joshualibrarian> Okay... now why isn't it updating my callback function after initilization?
[02:07:51] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/KXnv7/35/
[02:07:54] <someprimetime> trying to save money probably
[02:10:35] <red_square> joshualibrarian need to call self.options.callback
[02:11:21] <joshualibrarian> awesome!
[02:13:16] <someprimetime> joshualibrarian: i see you're using the plugin method now
[02:13:17] <someprimetime> nice
[02:13:56] <joshualibrarian> someprimetime:  yes, the widget structure solves all of the problems I was having with the $.fn plugins!
[02:14:07] <someprimetime> hell yeah man i'm doing the same myself for some tabs
[02:14:08] <joshualibrarian> someprimetime:  I am so close to being done with this project.
[02:14:15] <someprimetime> joshualibrarian: this for work?
[02:14:32] <someprimetime> i know the feeling for certain projects
[02:14:36] <magegu> hi guys, I'm struggling with a static method call - i basically want to call $.pluginName.close() from wherever i want - is this possible?
[02:14:50] <joshualibrarian> someprimetime: work/learning...
[02:14:58] <someprimetime> right on
[02:15:07] <someprimetime> how long have you been using jquery?
[02:15:09] * joshualibrarian is obviously new to jquery... and misses strong types.
[02:15:30] <joshualibrarian> someprimetime: I dove right in with this one.
[02:16:05] <someprimetime> you aren't doing that bad it seems.
[02:16:51] <joshualibrarian> someprimetime: finally starting to feel almost comfortable with this funny syntax of anonymous functions and these javascript 'objects'.
[02:17:06] <joshualibrarian> thanks to all the help in this channel anyway!
[02:17:17] <someprimetime> ah yes. i recommend reading javascript: the good parts if you ever get a chance
[02:17:36] <someprimetime> gives a good insight into the language
[02:18:26] <joshualibrarian> I'll check that out, thank you very much.
[02:19:12] <TurboDumper> thx red_square ill try it
[02:29:51] <angelazou> is there an equivalent of empty() in jquery/javascript?
[02:32:02] <someprimetime> .remove()?
[02:32:09] <someprimetime> http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[02:32:30] <angelazou> doesn't that delete stuff?
[02:32:49] <angelazou> someprimetime: I just need to check if the variable has no values
[02:33:08] <angelazou> but I know that the variable will definitely be set
[02:33:41] <someprimetime> so why not just do if(!var || var === undefined) { // var has no value }
[02:33:52] <someprimetime> empty() and remove() get rid of DOM elements
[02:34:00] <someprimetime> not check for the truthiness of a variable
[02:34:08] <angelazou> oh, i'm from php...
[02:34:21] <angelazou> jquery is nice though, much easier and less complicated than javascript
[02:34:23] <someprimetime> no worries same here
[02:34:33] <someprimetime> well it is still javascript (technically)
[02:34:34] <red_square> jquery is javascript
[02:34:38] <someprimetime> but yeah, it's a lot less to remember
[02:35:20] <angelazou> very handy, i just read about it today, very interesting (although the syntax looks a bit weird)
[02:35:32] <angelazou> have to adjust to not assigning a function name...
[02:35:45] <rue> No technically about it, jQuery is a Javascript library.
[02:35:53] <someprimetime> right
[02:35:58] <angelazou> oh, i thought it's a framework
[02:36:09] <someprimetime> you probably should break your stuff into functions though angelazou
[02:36:17] <someprimetime> otherwise it'll get sloppy, quickly
[02:36:20] <angelazou> what's the difference between framework and library?
[02:36:31] <angelazou> well, i'll definitely do that
[02:37:17] <angelazou> and I've seen some people write it as $(document), where others wrote jQuery(document), are there any difference?
[02:38:20] <someprimetime> framework is more of a skeleton (like any MVC based framework you'd find in php like cake, CI, lithium, etc. but a library are more definitions which you can use as you need
[02:38:34] <someprimetime> so in cakephp, you have to use the entire framework to build something
[02:38:44] <someprimetime> in jquery, you can pick and choose what you want to use to enhance your application
[02:38:45] <gloomer> angelazou no
[02:39:03] <someprimetime> jQuery is the same as writing $
[02:39:08] <someprimetime> $ maps to jQuery
[02:39:21] <gloomer> $(function() { is same as $(document).ready(funciton () {
[02:39:26] <someprimetime> and $(function() {}); is another way to initialize jquery which i prefer
[02:39:28] <ish10> hey guys I am trying to run my click function before a hyperlink redirects. i.e $('#myLink').click(function().. How can I disable so the function runs and it doesnt redirect?
[02:39:29] <angelazou> but that should avoid any conflicts with javascript stuff using $, right?
[02:39:51] <someprimetime> ish10: return false?
[02:40:06] <someprimetime> angelazou: not always, you can still run into issues if other libraries claim $
[02:40:27] <someprimetime> which is a good reason to wrap it in a closure with a plugin
[02:40:43] <angelazou> and i'm having a bit of trouble understanding callback functions
[02:40:52] <ish10> someprimetime, lol it works. Did not expect that
[02:41:25] <angelazou> i know they are functions that execute when an event has ended, and i know they don't have a function name. But I still don't get their significance
[02:41:55] <angelazou> what do you mean with "wrap it in a closure with a plugin"
[02:42:07] <someprimetime> it has to wait until the function completes until it runs
[02:42:24] <someprimetime> say if you have a callback on the ajax() function.. you want it to do something after it completes
[02:42:35] <someprimetime> putting it within that method allows you to do it immediately after
[02:42:43] <someprimetime> like say you wanted it to say "Sucess!"
[02:42:45] <someprimetime> or something
[02:43:17] <angelazou> i see, thanks
[02:43:19] <someprimetime> it makes more sense to put it inside of the callback instead of outside of the function, otherwise it'll run before ajax()
[02:43:21] <someprimetime> Success* rather
[03:46:43] <nVee> I need to add a delay to a very simple fadein fadeout script. I am using each() to iterate through the array, but there is no "pauses". Any help?
[03:46:44] <nVee> http://jsfiddle.net/LCtcj/
[03:49:55] <red_square> nVee use the callback
[03:55:27] <nVee> red_square: Do I check if the callback is set before continuing?
[03:55:41] <nVee> and, my existing code appears to fadein() all the photos at once
[03:57:48] <red_square> it will because the each is very quick
[03:57:53] <manixor> Hello guys. I've import the latest jquery min file in eclipse and I get 3 errors and  97 warnings. Do you know what can be the reason. I need to install some plugin on eclipse to be compatible with jquery?
[03:58:34] <mansoor> manixor, don't use eclipse :)
[03:59:20] <manixor> mansoor: Can you suggest other editor for a static website with html, jquery, php?
[04:00:09] <red_square> nVee see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6718172/running-jquery-animations-serially
[04:00:16] <mansoor> manixor, what platform?
[04:01:34] <manixor> mansoor: For Windows XP. I want something with intellisense and error and warnings.
[04:02:17] <mansoor> ohh... I don't know of any that does that.. I'm working on one but its not finished :D
[04:03:27] <red_square> visual studio manixor
[04:03:50] <mansoor> ahh yes there is one
[04:16:42] <manixor> red_square: Pff, I really don't want to go with VS, I'm hopping to find a solution for eclipse, or to switch to another editor that is compatible with Linux too.
[04:17:17] <mansoor> manixor, you code c++? :D
[04:17:54] <manixor> mansoor: On daily base yes. + python, but in weekend html, jquery, php
[04:18:10] <manixor> For c++ and python I use eclipse on Linux
[04:19:14] <manixor> mansoor: red_square What do you think about komodo?
[04:19:35] <mansoor> manixor, its my editor of choice for javascript
[04:19:49] <mansoor> although having trouble with it under KDE :(
[04:21:14] <mansoor> manixor, done any Qt developement?
[04:22:50] <manixor> mansoor: No.
[04:23:41] <mansoor> You should :D
[04:25:19] <red_square> manixor never used it
[04:25:38] <manixor> red_square: Qt?
[04:25:50] <mansoor> komodo
[04:26:16] <manixor> red_square: komodo? What you think about it?
[04:26:28] <red_square> yup, never heard of it, till know
[04:26:44] <red_square> i used visual studio as I am a c# dev mostly
[04:26:49] <red_square> use*

[04:59:38] <puccio> hi all, is there a method to execute the first alert before the second alert? --> http://pastebin.com/XABFSrv0
[05:00:41] <red_square> puccio no because the ajax call is async
[05:01:06] <puccio> red_square, but in the option there is async: false,
[05:01:14] <puccio> but didin't work
[05:01:15] <red_square> dont do that
[05:01:38] <red_square> ? async
[05:01:39] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[05:02:14] <red_square> puccio use deferreds
[05:02:34] <red_square> $.when(someAjaxCall).then(......

[05:43:41] <Vorspire> (red_square): thanks for your advice yesterday when you mentioned the iframe, apologies for being stubborn on yor answer - it turns out that for some reason jQuery would not normalize the "scrolling" attribute of an IFrame if set to "true" or "false" when calling .attr with an array of options - it only seems to happen within the bounds of my site - I tried to replicate it with jsFiddle to no avail.
[05:44:48] <red_square> no worries Vorspire
[06:01:21] <johanhar> For a select multiple, what kind of event do I want to bind to? If I click an element, then drag my mouse over more elements, and let go of the mouse-button, then the elements that was "draged over" but not clicked will be ignored, if you understand... hmm
[06:01:48] <johanhar> For .click that is
[06:02:40] <VarunBatra>     Which is better? To have 10 global variables or having one global array with associative values or having global object? Does javascript stores all variable into dom element?
[06:02:40] <VarunBatra>     If my code has many for loop and I am using variable 'i', should I take it as global or I take it as local, (Considering fact that I will be initializing it as 0 within loop which means I will be careful what does it has to avoid any logical error)
[06:04:19] <dabear> VarunBatra: as few global variables as possible. use an object to store key/values, or use .data()
[06:04:59] <dabear> VarunBatra: if you have an ordinary loop with a variable increasing inside the loop + event binding in the loop, the value of the variable will be the same for all event handlers
[06:06:13] <dabear> e.g. if for(var i=0; i<10;i++){  foo[i].bind("click", function(){  /* the variable i will always be 10 here*/  }   )}
[06:10:10] <aaairc> i have a div that may begin on page load either hidden or visible. the very first time it is visible i'd like to trigger a function to occur... i'm not really sure how to do that... anyone have any ideas?
[06:10:55] <Vorspire> for(var i=0; i<10;i++){ var x = i; foo[i].bind("click", function(){ /* i == 9, x == 0<>9 */ } )}
[06:12:12] <Vorspire> (aaairc): $("#div").is(":visible").someFunction()
[06:12:16] <johanhar> If "this" is an option element in a select, how can I ask to get all option elements after this one as they are listed in the template?
[06:12:39] <dabear> ?nextall @ johanhar
[06:12:40] <bot-t> johanhar, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/

[06:14:27] <aaairc> Vorspire: but i don't know when the div is going to be visible... meaning it might happen on page load, or 2 minutes in when a user clicks one of 5 different buttons that could make it visible... and then when those clicks occur an animation occurs before it is fully visible.
[06:14:44] <aaairc> Vorspire: so i don't know when to do the check to see if it is visible
[06:14:49] <VarunBatra> Thanks dabear
[06:15:25] <Vorspire> if( selection.is(":visible") ){ selection.animate( ... ); }
[06:15:41] <VarunBatra> Any javascript editor that can help me out in not only coding hints but also in taking performance into account?
[06:15:41] <Vorspire> or selection.stop(); //to stop current animations
[06:17:10] <aaairc> Vorspire: was that a response to me?
[06:17:41] <dabear> ?ask @ VarunBatra
[06:17:42] <bot-t> VarunBatra, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:20:13] <aaairc> Is there a way to trigger an event when a div has a specific set of attributes/style set on it... for example left: 200px; position: absolute;
[06:21:17] <johanhar> I've got a pretty complicated regex question, where do I go ask? Stackoverflow maybe?
[06:22:05] <dabear> aaairc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4561845/firing-event-on-dom-attribute-change
[06:22:33] <dabear> johanhar: or in ##javascript
[06:22:37] <astropirate> johanhar: define complicated... and  probably #javascript
[06:23:17] <aaairc> dabear: would you recommend using the Mutation Events plugin for jQuery... says in the StackOverflow response it says there is poor browser support for it
[06:23:42] <dabear> aaairc: I would reccomend finding another solution to your problem
[06:23:59] <dabear> i.e. a workaround
[06:24:16] <dabear> think hard about why you need to check for certain properties..
[06:25:11] <aaairc> dabear: yeah thats good advice... trying to think about other approaches to a solution right now
[06:35:26] <kaneda^> hey guys, i'm trying to vertical-align some dynamic content
[06:35:35] <kaneda^> but i've tried everything and it won't stay aligned
[06:35:46] <kaneda^> what do you suggest?
[06:39:40] <sodhi> I call upon thee, jQuery gods: I have a problem with .click, specifically .click does not register an event for me the very first time it is clicked. I've taken the liberty uploading a sample @ http://jsfiddle.net/EuPma/ - the problemarea is in the jQuery code where the comment is. To reproduce: Click the white button, then click inside the popupmenu. It closes. Now click the white button again,
[06:39:40] <sodhi> and click inside the popupmenu; it now stays open. I want output #2 to be the constant one :)
[06:42:19] <sodhi> kaneda^: largely depends on the content. I'd need to see some source.
[06:42:27] <moesti> hi, is there a plugin where i can drag and drop multiple files in a input-file field
[06:42:30] <moesti> ?
[06:42:32] <sodhi> also, vertically-aligning is hardly a jQuery question ;-)
[06:42:50] <kaneda^> sodhi, true, and it doesnt work regardless
[06:42:56] <kaneda^> sodhi, i've tried it in plain js too

[06:43:19] <moesti> ty
[06:43:20] <sodhi> kaneda^: vertically aligning is a css issue
[06:43:23] <kaneda^> yep
[06:43:45] <kaneda^> i've tried dynamically valigning the row, the cell, the div, parts of the div, the container
[06:43:50] <kaneda^> it just doesnt seem to listen to me :|
[06:43:53] <sodhi> Give us some source :-)
[06:44:31] <kaneda^> sodhi,  is triggering the update event necessary?
[06:44:47] <sodhi> excuse me?
[06:46:43] <kaneda^> sodhi, the answer, yes it is, and i forgot to do it
[06:46:46] <kaneda^> fixed it
[06:48:27] <sodhi> alright. :P

[07:53:39] <ninmorfeo74> ok
[07:54:08] <chee> kaneda^: there is a #css, you know :3
[07:55:05] <ninmorfeo74> why if i use this code, my counter at end of animation give me 5 value ?
[07:55:30] <ninmorfeo74> var counter=0
[07:55:30] <ninmorfeo74> $j('a.menu_btn').on('mouseenter',function(){
[07:55:30] <ninmorfeo74>                 $j('a.menu_btn').off()
[07:55:30] <ninmorfeo74>                                   $j('ul.menu li').not(":animated").animate({

[07:55:34] <stefunz> hello. does anybody know a good looking wizard plugin for jquery (i saw jWizard and "jquery form wizard" but i think they are not really good looking) - so are there any alternatives? any ressource would be very appreciated
[07:55:48] <ninmorfeo74> and not 1
[07:56:25] <stefunz> ninmorfeo74: can you host the example file ?
[07:56:44] <chee> ninmorfeo74: don't paste in here ! paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net
[07:56:48] <ninmorfeo74> ok i give you addres wait
[07:57:09] <ninmorfeo74> sorry im newbuy
[07:57:38] <astropirate> yes you are a newbuy :p
[07:57:44] <astropirate> i'm a newbie
[07:57:46] <stefunz> :D

[08:00:18] <ninmorfeo74> http://www.eye-artdesign.it/home.html and code is here http://www.eye-artdesign.it/js/anim_menu3.js
[08:00:34] <ninmorfeo74> if you go on mouseover on menu voice
[08:00:49] <ninmorfeo74> you can see the counter in page
[08:05:19] <stefunz> ninmorfeo74: just taking a guess - maybe it's 5 because there are 6 <li> elements (so count from 0 to 5)… i really don't understand your code because it's not indented
[08:07:13] <stefunz> ninmorfeo74: write in channel :)
[08:08:15] <ninmorfeo74> so
[08:08:32] <ninmorfeo74> .its because he animate 6 element so callback end function 6 time ?
[08:10:03] <ninmorfeo74> sorry for my bad english im italian
[08:10:40] <victoire> Hi, quick question. Let's say I have two JQ objects: 'var a=$('.foo'),b=$('.bar');'
[08:11:07] <victoire> Is there a way to replace the elements in set A with those in B, within a chain?
[08:11:29] <victoire> a.show().swapWith(b).hide()
[08:11:34] <pifantastic> wat
[08:11:41] <pifantastic> why not just do a.show(); b.hide() ?
[08:12:00] <dabear> a.show().replaceWith(b.hide())
[08:12:14] <pifantastic> ?replaceWith @ pif
[08:12:15] <bot-t1> pif, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[08:12:20] <pifantastic> ohhh
[08:12:23] <pifantastic> literally replace in the DOM
[08:12:25] <victoire> No, I don't want to manipulate the DOM
[08:12:42] <dabear> pushstack
[08:12:46] <pifantastic> oh, then why do you need to replace them in the chain?
[08:12:46] <dabear> ?pushstack
[08:12:46] <bot-t1> .pushStack(elements): Add a collection of DOM elements onto the jQuery stack. http://api.jquery.com/pushStack/
[08:13:12] <victoire> I'm doing property assignment to a JQ object, and I don't want to do 'this.active.hide(); this.active=b.show();' if there's a way to consolidate that into a single line
[08:13:39] <pifantastic> uhm
[08:13:48] <pifantastic> sometimes
[08:13:50] <pifantastic> it's okay
[08:13:54] <pifantastic> to have 2 lines of code
[08:14:05] <dabear> yep
[08:14:26] <victoire> Oh no shit? Man, I've been living in a bubble. Been writing 1 line programs for years
[08:14:54] <pifantastic> well damn!
[08:15:03] <pifantastic> Looks like I just changed your life.
[08:15:24] <pifantastic> victoire: doing it the way you want is going to be less performant, inherently
[08:15:37] <dabear> I actually wrote the entire logic in jquery in a single line once
[08:15:43] <dabear> just for the kicks
[08:15:56] <pifantastic> iNsAnItY
[08:18:33] <destryalhmns> insantiy is a criminal justice system that puts people in prison for life for posessing weed
[08:19:48] <victoire> Would it really be dramatically less performant? :> If so, why?
[08:20:27] <djQuery1> any word on UI i.9?
[08:20:43] <victoire> Also, a better example of where this would be useful is in enumerating an object literal
[08:20:55] <destryalhmns> well i wrote this test last night which shows a spectacular difference between $ and straight js www.seanmchugh.info/compare.htm
[08:21:12] <victoire> You could just do var foo={bar:$('#one').action().swapWith('#two')}
[08:22:07] <pifantastic> victoire: you're just making the code way harder to follow
[08:22:25] <pifantastic> $('#one').action(); var foo = { bar: $('#two') };
[08:22:43] <pifantastic> I don't know why you want to ruin the readability of code just to save a single line
[08:23:16] <moldy> hi
[08:23:18] <victoire> destryalhmns: That's not really a fair comparison
[08:23:26] <pifantastic> why stop there? var foo = $('$one').action().swapWith('#two').andMakeitAn(Object).withKey('bar');
[08:23:37] <victoire> You should create an anon function in your vanilla for loop
[08:23:51] <red_square> http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-for-loop/65
[08:24:24] <red_square> jq each is alot slower
[08:24:43] <pifantastic> that is a ridiculous test
[08:24:53] <victoire> No shit? Function declaration will always be slower
[08:25:14] <victoire> Show me a JS Perf of $.each vs .map -- that might start to be worth looking at
[08:25:49] <red_square> eh?
[08:25:57] <pifantastic> wat
[08:26:00] <pifantastic> if anything
[08:26:06] <pifantastic> compare $.each to native forEach
[08:31:05] <palok> hello there... I am trying to port a wordpress theme plugin to the newest version of jquery, and I am experiencing a JS error that I don't understand. The site is http://galerie-armania.fr/?page_id=228 and I get this error: "Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function". Any clue ? This seems to be related to .ready() but syntax seems to be OK.
[08:33:11] <pifantastic> palok: use jQuery instead of $
[08:33:12] <victoire> palok: Probably a namespacing issue
[08:33:27] <palok> thanks, i'll try this right now
[08:33:33] <pifantastic> palok: if you notice, the file you are using to load jQuery has a `jQuery.noConflict() at the end
[08:33:36] <victoire> Or one of your scripts is releasing $ via .noConflict()
[08:33:39] <victoire> ^
[08:33:42] <pifantastic> which returns $ to its original value
[08:33:47] <pifantastic> which in your case is undefined
[08:33:49] <palok> OK I understand
[08:52:52] <nisseni> is there a way to empty the value of a field on click?
[08:53:15] <PyDon> hi
[08:53:58] <aidan_> How could I extract the values from a class of li's like so: http://jsfiddle.net/bSBdp/
[08:54:09] <aidan_> Ideally I'd like to end up with an array of their values.
[08:55:54] <palok> pifantastic, where did you see there was a call to noConflict() ? I can't find it in any of the files
[08:56:05] <destryalhmns> question about jquery-ui - is there a way to apply their backgrounds to my divs? and how do you get their buttons?
[08:58:25] <PyDon> can anyone help me? via query i create checkboxes by time and need a function that is triggered when one these checboxes is triggered
[08:58:30] <red_square> ? .map @ aidan_
[08:58:31] <bot-t> aidan_, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:00:03] <aidan_> red_square: thanks!
[09:00:31] <red_square> not sure that is what you want actually aidan_
[09:00:46] <red_square> but li's dont have values so not sure what you mean
[09:01:29] <zfmf1> he guys, how can i call this method from another js file ? http://pastebin.com/ahAAEt2t i get always runit is not defined
[09:01:45] <aidan_> red_square: I want to get the value showed inbetween the <li> and </li> tags.. In my example it would return an array = ["item 1","item 2"]
[09:02:02] <red_square> zfmf1 you need to define it on the window object, at the moment it is in a anon func closure
[09:02:30] <red_square> zfmf1 but dont pullute the window object better to use an app namespace then use that
[09:04:14] <destryalhmns> nm you can use use ui-widget-content
[09:04:31] <victoire> aidan_: http://jsfiddle.net/XSgEj/
[09:05:24] <aidan_> victoire: Thanks! :) exactly what I was looking for
[09:08:21] <zfmf1> red_square:  thanks, but i have no idea what you mean :D
[09:12:12] <red_square> zfmf1 well very basically http://pastebin.com/Hg1e1LEU
[09:12:49] <red_square> creates an App object on the window object, that you assign things to, like a function
[09:15:14] <Noeble> question: my jquery script seems to remove my slahes.. I added a css style background in a div that I append.. but it ends up "http:  url..."  anyone know why?

[09:31:33] <Noeble> question: my jquery script seems to remove my slahes.. I added a css style background in a div that I append.. but it ends up "http:  url..."  anyone know why?
[09:33:07] <dwatts> Noeble: do you need to preceede quotation marks with a back slash in your jquery?

[09:36:36] <devmikey> Question: When using .attr() to change an image, it caches the old image.  Only way to currently get around it is with +'?'+Date.now() appened to the end of the script.  Is there a way I could use something within jquery itself?
[09:39:46] <pifantastic> devmikey: npoe
[09:39:47] <pifantastic> nope*
[09:40:16] <devmikey> :(
[09:40:34] <pifantastic> Noeble: yeah, you're quotes are messed up in several places
[09:40:38] <pifantastic> your*
[09:41:33] <Noeble> pifantastic: hmm but rest seems to work fine
[09:41:43] <Noeble> pifantastic: where is it messed up?
[09:41:56] <pifantastic> Noeble: the div's class attr isn't closed
[09:42:11] <pifantastic> the easiest thing to do is remove the double quotes in url()
[09:42:14] <pifantastic> you don't need them
[09:43:26] <Noeble> pifantastic: ty, got it working now
[09:44:16] * HardFu announces that Carmivore has been updated, to check your stats, see http://carmivore.com/your-nickname
[09:46:33] <devmikey> Can I use .ajax() to do what .attr does?
[09:46:50] <pifantastic> what do you mean?
[09:46:54] <pifantastic> they are completely different
[09:48:28] <devmikey> i guess not then
[09:49:01] <Cherrum> Question, say I pass a global to a function that in turns returns a modified version of it -- will it by default by working with the real global.. or?
[09:49:54] <dwatts> devmikey: have you tried removing the attribute and then adding it again. It may get around the image cache issue although I am speculating.
[09:50:04] <pifantastic> Cherrum: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/bKbbQ/
[09:50:33] <pifantastic> devmikey: you can do $('img').attr('src', 'some new source');
[09:50:49] <pifantastic> if that's what you mean
[09:52:06] <puccio> pifantastic, can you help me please?
[09:52:14] <pifantastic> ?ask @ puccio
[09:52:14] <bot-t> puccio, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:52:28] <zfmf1> red_square:  it woked thanks ;)
[09:52:29] <puccio> I want to change href value ---> http://pastebin.com/Gm6Vg3pB
[09:53:52] <pifantastic> $ajax is asynchronous, so you are setting the attr() before the success callback is executed
[09:53:55] <pifantastic> puccio: ^
[09:54:01] <pifantastic> which is why your current code will not work
[09:54:01] <puccio> I know that problem , in this case, is async, but is there a method? thank you
[09:55:04] <puccio> pifantastic, if I change the value as you say, the link clicked is not followed
[09:55:25] <devmikey> pifantastic: It still caches that if the new source is a script
[09:55:41] <pifantastic> puccio: http://pastebin.com/FXGL6VMg
[09:55:56] <puccio> I want change the value of href, with a value returned by ajax call, and after follow that link
[09:56:01] <pifantastic> puccio: oh
[09:56:04] <pifantastic> hmm
[09:56:06] <pifantastic> that is harder to do
[09:56:18] <devmikey> apparently even if that script's headers specifically say not to cache in the image it generates
[09:56:20] <devmikey> bastards
[09:56:24] <puccio> pifantastic, like you say, the link followed is http://blablabla/#
[09:56:31] <puccio> doesn't work
[09:56:47] <pifantastic> puccio: try this maybe: http://pastebin.com/Wqha3fFr
[09:57:01] <pifantastic> devmikey: yeah, I had to deal with this issue last week too
[09:57:09] <pifantastic> devmikey: it won't cache cross-pages
[09:57:09] <puccio> wait, I try
[09:57:13] <puccio> 1 minuts
[09:57:14] <pifantastic> but during the current page, it will cache
[09:57:19] <dwatts> puccio: Why not just use window.location?
[09:57:31] <pifantastic> devmikey: easiest thing to do is add a cache busting param every ittime

[09:59:30] <puccio> this is the old methos I done
[10:00:02] <puccio> I don't want to use window.open, for the popup advise

[10:00:12] <pifantastic> puccio: I don't think there is any other way
[10:00:15] <victoire> Methos is Deathos
[10:00:21] <pifantastic> puccio: you can imagone the security concern
[10:00:29] <puccio> yes I know pifantastic
[10:00:29] <pifantastic> of changing the href of a link after someone clicks it
[10:00:38] <puccio> yes , you reason
[10:00:49] <pifantastic> in fact
[10:00:55] <pifantastic> it looks like whateever you're doing
[10:00:56] <puccio> but my thinking is in good
[10:01:06] <pifantastic> might be a bit manipulative
[10:01:09] <pifantastic> :P
[10:01:22] <puccio> yes

[10:05:55] <ari5av> good afternoon internet friends.  I'm having an issue with jquery ui, and googling is not giving me any answers that are helping me.  disclaimer: yes, I've tried every solution that seems right on stackoverflow and the first couple of pages of google results
[10:06:12] <pifantastic> destryalhmns: are you loading the jQuery UI CSS?
[10:06:19] <destryalhmns> yep, get it
[10:06:27] <destryalhmns> hold on ill upload to prove
[10:06:56] <pifantastic> ari5av: sup?
[10:07:21] <ari5av> I'm using twitter bootstrap as an overall layout guide for my site, and I'm also using jquery ui datepicker.  but the datepicker itself seems to be completely unstyled (no background image or shade, etc)
[10:07:44] <ari5av> it works when I don't have bootstrap included, but that's something I definitely need
[10:07:52] <victoire> pifantastic: javascript doesn't pass anything by reference
[10:08:00] <victoire> It passes references by value
[10:08:11] <destryalhmns> www.seanmchugh.info/hellowrld.htm
[10:08:12] <ari5av> so I was wondering if anyone has any experience making the two work together well
[10:08:22] <destryalhmns> i want the icon
[10:08:35] <theBrettman> damn, they stripped a lot of styling out of the newer ui themes... pain in the ass now but I guess I can understand why they did it...
[10:09:27] <pifantastic> destryalhmns: http://jqueryui.com/themes/base/ui.all.css
[10:09:32] <pifantastic> click that link bra ^
[10:09:42] <destryalhmns> i did an hour ago
[10:09:47] <pifantastic> victoire: "It passes references by value", what do you mean?
[10:10:14] <pifantastic> destryalhmns: it's a 404 for me
[10:10:31] <Marko_> Guys I get error in my code which become error inside of jquery code. How I can find more info about this error? error I get is:   Object required  jquery.min.js, line 16 character 15511
[10:10:38] <destryalhmns> i just checked it on the server and it worked

[10:11:24] <Marko_> in my dev toolbar  in debug mode I have two local variabloes availbe  one is HTML object called e and second is someobject call f
[10:11:24] <theBrettman> anyone know if there's a way to get themeswitcher to use older versions of the themes?
[10:11:48] <destryalhmns> so how can you display a jquery ui-icon?
[10:11:50] <victoire> pifantastic, if JS was really passing the object by reference, original.myVal would return false
[10:11:56] <destryalhmns> n characters or less
[10:12:43] <dwatts> Marko_: can you post your code?
[10:12:51] <theBrettman> destryalhmns, you just have to have the stylesheet for the ui-theme it comes from and then you add the classes you need for the buttons
[10:13:01] <destryalhmns> true
[10:13:03] <theBrettman> one for ui-icon
[10:13:05] <Marko_> dwatts: actually no, because I have no idea which part of code is producing error and there is a lot of code.
[10:13:08] <destryalhmns> but then you get into maybe they will change it
[10:13:10] <theBrettman> and one for the name of the icon
[10:13:12] <destryalhmns> im looking for the official way
[10:13:16] <pifantastic> victoire: ah, I see
[10:13:31] <theBrettman> that's why you use the styles
[10:13:34] <dwatts> Are you getting JSON?
[10:13:51] <Marko_> I would love to find out which code is that. I can if I debug whole code from the start. I am just curious if I can find what code is wrong from place in jquery code where actually error is thrown.
[10:14:01] <destryalhmns> in my scenario i could go unicode but ..i tried the example in their documentation and it wont work. now i am confused
[10:14:08] <theBrettman> of course, just cuz you do it the official way, don't mean you won't have problems like I'm having now
[10:14:26] <destryalhmns> back in a minute, ill figure this crap out
[10:14:47] <theBrettman> I have my stuff on an older version of the styles and I want the themeswitcher but they stripped a lot of styles out of the newer version so my stuff is all screwed up
[10:16:42] <Marco-123> ive got hierarchical data stored in a table n the Nested Interval fashion. is there a jquery tool you are aware of for making a treeview of it directly?
[10:16:45] <theBrettman> oh, if you want the stylesheet, which one you want?
[10:17:01] <Marko_> dwatts: are you asking me about json?
[10:17:03] <theBrettman> you could use the themeswitcher, then you get all of them
[10:18:10] <theBrettman> then you don't have to get any stylesheets cuz it gets them for you. all you do is run themeswitcher() on an element
[10:20:52] <theBrettman> ha, nvm. I see why the styles are stripped. you have to have that main style someone linked to above that is 404 or some style for a base
[10:21:12] <theBrettman> I just used one of the older stylesheets that I had
[10:21:22] <theBrettman> it has what the themeswitcher is missing. fixed!
[10:21:29] <lacrymology> I'm trying to make a plugin, and it's not working, it says the method I added to $.fn doesn't exist. The script is included, and not raising any errors at least on the console. What's a good way of debugging what's going on?
[10:21:46] <theBrettman> you don't have jquery

[10:22:58] <theBrettman> oh, the @ is supposed to have a space after it! how do you know all the commands to send the bot?
[10:23:12] <tw2113> Eviltwin that slideshow has an awesome first image
[10:23:53] <chee> theBrettman: Eviltwin is also a bot
[10:24:03] <theBrettman> rofl @ chee
[10:24:10] <tw2113> i figured bot-t was but not Eviltwin :P
[10:24:17] <theBrettman> he's joking
[10:24:35] <tw2113> damn, he forgot to globalize var sarcasm
[10:24:38] <tw2113> my bad
[10:24:42] <theBrettman> lol

[10:25:13] <theBrettman> we need a fembot in here, lol
[10:25:35] <theBrettman> that will come in handy!

[10:26:00] <chee> Eviltwin was written by coldhead  in one afternoon
[10:26:04] <chee> he had a hangover
[10:26:19] <lacrymology> I know all of those, I'm trying to figure out why is it not working. My best guess is that maybe i'm loading jQuery twice?
[10:26:34] <destryalhmns> http://coolvibe.com/page/2/?s=bot
[10:27:10] <destryalhmns> creepy yes, awesome insightful art... YES
[10:31:06] <destryalhmns> okay i cant figure it out
[10:31:19] <destryalhmns> as far as i can tell i am following the c\docmentation exactly and yet still no icon
[10:32:46] <Marko_> Guys I get error in my code which become error inside of jquery code. How I can find more info about this error? error I get is:   Object required  jquery.min.js, line 16 character 15511
[10:32:57] <Marko_> in my dev toolbar  in debug mode I have two local variabloes availbe  one is HTML object called e and second is someobject called f.
[10:33:03] <destryalhmns> debugger;
[10:33:12] <Marko_> I cant provide the code because there is too much code and I don't know where is error exactly.
[10:33:41] <Marko_> destryalhmns: ? I did use debugging.
[10:33:47] <destryalhmns> you have to put debigger in the right spot and figure it out
[10:34:13] <destryalhmns> no one is going to learn all that and figure it out for you.... that is for you to do
[10:34:16] <Marko_> and how do I know where is right spot? That's what I try to figure out and I hope that jquery and debug could help me.
[10:34:34] <destryalhmns> you have to think about it
[10:34:51] <Marko_> *facepalm"
[10:34:58] <Marko_> nevermind.
[10:35:02] <destryalhmns> k good
[10:35:05] <destryalhmns> i hope you die
[10:36:54] <Marko_> Anyone else with some usefull tip rather than being bad mannered? I tried to debug from the start and I find the place where does code skipps to jquery and I got error , but I compared this code with  last working version and nothing changed there.
[10:37:34] <Marko_> I think there some html element was deleted or it's id was changed and jquery is calling some method on this object(non existing) object. but I am not sure.
[10:37:42] <pifantastic> ?p @ Marko_
[10:37:43] <bot-t> Marko_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:38:23] <Marko_> pifantastic: I would love to show the code but there is too much code and don't know which to past. I can past the code from which debuggers jumps to jquery and error is thrown...
[10:38:50] <pifantastic> Marko_: what debugger are you using? It should have a stack trace
[10:39:05] <Marko_> IE 8 toolbar(I have to use IE :( )
[10:39:21] <pifantastic> :(
[10:39:28] <pifantastic> it doesn't provide a stack trace?
[10:39:41] <Marko_> and it place of error where debugger stops I have three entries in call stack all refers inside of jquery.
[10:40:16] <pifantastic> Marko_: where in jQuery is the error occurring?
[10:40:20] * tw2113 petitions to get Marko_ a job that doesn't require IE
[10:40:27] <Marko_> ;)
[10:42:16] <Marko_>   Object required  jquery.min.js, line 16 character 15511 ->  http://imageshack.us/f/832/debugger.jpg/
[10:42:40] <pifantastic> Marko_: see that tab that says "Call stack"?
[10:42:40] <pifantastic> what does that show?
[10:42:47] <destryalhmns> i need a brilliant female coder to sit on my lap and solve problems
[10:42:51] <pifantastic> also, it may be easier if you use a non-minified jquery
[10:43:00] <diegoviola> hi
[10:43:08] <diegoviola> any good slideshow plugin you could recommend?
[10:43:13] <diegoviola> for jquery
[10:43:17] <pifantastic> destryalhmns: let's avoid misogyny plz
[10:43:22] <lacrymology> I've got a whole bunch of these: $(this).find(".paging").show(); $(this).find(".paging a:first").addClass("active"); var imageWidth = $(this).find(".window").width();  << any way of not repeating $(this).find... over and over?
[10:43:29] <destryalhmns> k sry
[10:43:40] <destryalhmns> was just pointing out a problem
[10:43:48] <Marko_> pifantastic:  as I mensioned it shows calls inside of jquery
[10:43:51] <Marko_> mentioed
[10:43:55] <Marko_> mentioned...
[10:44:06] <pifantastic> Marko_: yes, but at some point your code has to call jQuery code
[10:44:22] <pifantastic> so the call stack should find it's way back to your code
[10:44:35] <Marko_> yes call stack does not show that and ps last working code(after which i go inside of jquery and I get error is) $(document).ready(function() { 		$("#tabsTable td").click(function(event) { and  $("#tabsTable td") returns 11
[10:44:49] <Marko_> $("#tabsTable td") .size() returns 11
[10:44:56] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[10:46:06] <pifantastic> Marko_: it's almost impossible for us to debug your code without seeing it. You need to set some break points. Try to pinpoint where the error is happening
[10:47:43] <Marko_> pifantastic: i pasted all what I see I set debugger on line   $("#tabsTable td").click(function(event) { some code }  then it goes to line where code for listener is endidng (}); ) and from there it goes right to jquery where I get error which I have whon you
[10:48:42] <pifantastic> Marko_: do you still get errors if you change it to: $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#tabsTable td").click(function(event) { return });
[10:48:47] <pifantastic> god damnit colloquy
[10:49:00] <pifantastic> ignore the freenode link
[10:49:03] <pifantastic> my client auto inserts that
[10:49:46] <Marko_> yes I do
[10:49:50] <destryalhmns> ill post later
[10:49:59] <destryalhmns> awesome idea but cant express it yet, thx for your help all
[10:51:18] <pifantastic> Marko_: switch to using non-minified jquery
[10:51:25] <pifantastic> and the show me that stack trace
[10:53:40] <zivester> is there a preffered jquery plugin to create entry points for my 100% ajax application... something that will make /#users /#products /#categories ... i guess something to read # on page load, and trigger them when certain areas of my app are clicked
[10:54:23] <pifantastic> zivester: jQuery does not do that
[10:54:37] <zivester> similar to how gmail has #inbox, #starred, etc
[10:54:41] <pifantastic> zivester: but you might want to check out Backbone.js, or Spine.js
[10:54:57] <pifantastic> or Knockout.js
[10:55:00] <pifantastic> or Sproutcore.js
[10:55:05] <pifantastic> or JavascriptMVC
[10:55:15] <pifantastic> they are all framework for building javascript applications
[10:55:29] <Marko_> pifantastic: ok i shows only three entries - each is anonymous function and first points to this code http://pastebin.com/fJn9YJwF ( jquery.ready() )
[10:55:52] <zivester> thats a lot of options... i guess ill just see which one i can throw into my existing application easily
[10:56:13] <Marko_> pifantastic:  seconds points to http://pastebin.com/PEYdk0wb readyList.resolveWith
[10:56:14] <pifantastic> Marko_: that anonymous function is probably the function you are binding to document.ready
[10:56:32] <pifantastic> Marko_: so what's in your document.ready ?
[10:56:51] <Marko_> and third potins to http://pastebin.com/BcHXjeeq finally { (this is line 1011)
[10:57:01] <pifantastic> zivester: none of them. if you are looking for something more low level, ben alman's bbq has an onhashchange polyfill
[10:57:10] <pifantastic> ?g ben alman bbq @ zivester
[10:57:11] <bot-t> zivester, Ben Alman  jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[10:57:42] <Marko_> pifantastic:  what do you mean? there is that listnerer...
[10:58:06] <Marko_> pifantastic:  I think I will have to just replace all changes  which were made until the code will work
[11:02:40] <zivester> ahh pifantastic... bbq is what I think im looking for, tx!
[11:02:45] <pifantastic> np
[11:07:11] <ari5av> any official jquery-ui developers online?
[11:22:15] <grkblood> cached form fields are screwing up my mouseenters and mouseleaves, its counting these cached lists as being new elements. how do i compensate for this?
[11:25:56] <Seanmcn> Could someone help me out with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9055744/passing-id-to-selector-jquery
[11:26:46] <theBrettman> how can I do a click function in an iframe?
[11:27:47] <destryalhmns> theBrettman, i spent 2 days on that problem
[11:28:02] <destryalhmns> not just a single iframe but an infinite number of iframes nested
[11:28:18] <destryalhmns> let me see...
[11:28:51] <theBrettman> so were you successful?
[11:29:16] <destryalhmns> yep
[11:29:24] <destryalhmns> wrote some BADASS code
[11:29:28] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[11:29:42] <destryalhmns> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9024617/weird-infinite-loop-only-in-ie and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9034672/is-there-any-way-to-get-global-events-when-working-with-nested-iframes
[11:29:44] <theBrettman> I have a lot of that too but I need more! lol
[11:30:06] <destryalhmns> but it never let me post the solution because i wanted to post the answer too soon
[11:30:21] <destryalhmns> the code is at work, ill post it tommorow
[11:30:29] <theBrettman> oh damn
[11:30:38] <theBrettman> well maybe u can point me in the right direction tho
[11:30:47] <destryalhmns> for my problem all i needed was a copy and paste, but i wrote some cool code in like 5-6 lines
[11:30:56] <theBrettman> I'm not gonna have nested ones, just one I want to work with
[11:31:11] <theBrettman> it will load the page I want to edit and then I will save the page when done
[11:31:42] <Seanmcn> Hi can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/dRRRd/ Trying to dynamically pass an ID to the Jquery selector
[11:31:50] <destryalhmns> what event are you trying to attach?
[11:32:04] <theBrettman> I'm lazy so I'm making a chrome extension so I can use chromes inspector to edit styles and then save the revision it makes. smart, huh?
[11:32:53] <destryalhmns> attaching an event to an iframe
[11:33:00] <destryalhmns> thats what i can help with
[11:33:27] <theBrettman> oh, I said click()
[11:33:28] <theBrettman> lol
[11:33:47] <PyDon> can anyone help me? I use $('.test').click(..) to register a function which is triggered when a checkbox is clicked. Does anyone know why this does not work if a checkbox loaded with query later?
[11:34:02] <destryalhmns> k so like id you want to do click, googling tells you it is different cross browser but basically you use
[11:34:07] <aaronmcadam> ?on @ PyDon
[11:34:07] <bot-t> PyDon, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:34:10] <theBrettman> I tried $('iframe body').click();
[11:34:22] <destryalhmns> jquery to get your iframes in the document
[11:34:53] <destryalhmns> and then straught up dom to attack the handler myElement.onclick = function() { alert("hello world"); }
[11:35:05] <oojacoboo> umm, jquery will have to be loaded in the iframe and called in there for that
[11:35:08] <theBrettman> I actually gave the iframe an id of canvas so it's $('#canvas body').click();
[11:35:09] <destryalhmns> remember that second post, ill put it up... its good stuff
[11:35:21] <oojacoboo> that's two different DOMs
[11:36:07] <destryalhmns> just wait 24 hours
[11:36:08] <PyDon> hm, strange.. it just seems to work when a checkbox is in the html code on startup
[11:36:32] <destryalhmns> i will have a solution up at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9034672/is-there-any-way-to-get-global-events-when-working-with-nested-iframes which dominates iframes, trust me
[11:36:45] <aaronmcadam> PyDon: you need to learn how event binding works
[11:36:49] <theBrettman> yeah but I need it now to go any further
[11:36:55] <fraxture> Can one load jquery in the footer?  I'm thinking no, and I just moved mine to the footer and a number of elements that are modified via jquery in the body were not transformed.  Is this just not possible to do, or am I missing something?
[11:37:23] <theBrettman> yes, you can put it in the footer. it will load last that way
[11:37:41] <aaronmcadam> no need for a doc.ready either
[11:37:47] <theBrettman> yep
[11:38:24] <Seanmcn> Hi can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/dRRRd/ Trying to pass an ID to the Jquery selector
[11:39:11] <fraxture> theBrettman: what's confusing me is that when I moved my code, it clearly wasn't available when called by some scripts in the body of the page.
[11:39:25] <theBrettman> oh, I also had a problem when I moved my code into a wordpress page, (function($){}(jQuery)); wouldn't work. had to use $(window).load(function(){}); don't know why...
[11:39:47] <theBrettman> that's cuz those scripts are loading before jquery
[11:39:54] <PyDon> thx, it works
[11:39:55] <theBrettman> you need to set them to load on ready
[11:40:04] <Marco-123> hi all. on my client side, ive got javascript that sends an ajax post to my php. problem is, i need to access an object from javascript from within the success function. i know this break the asynchronous structure of it. but i was wondering if there was a way?
[11:41:04] <theBrettman> pass it as a parameter to the php
[11:42:24] <Marco-123> theBrettman: the object?! i didnt know you could do that.
[11:42:45] <Marco-123> could i then pass it to the success function?
[11:42:46] <theBrettman> no, just the info that needs passed
[11:42:48] <Marco-123> gonna try
[11:42:57] <theBrettman> you're going to have to show some kind of example
[11:43:40] <theBrettman> I'll have to see what you're trying to do in order to tell you the best way to do it...
[11:44:31] <fraxture> theBrettman: hmmmm they are, at least they look like they are: http://pastebin.com/gbDQcvrg
[11:44:35] <fraxture> that's one example
[11:45:51] <theBrettman> fraxture, you silly! what is $?
[11:45:56] <theBrettman> that is short for jQuery
[11:46:04] <aaronmcadam> Seanmcn: just add the right css: http://jsfiddle.net/dRRRd/9/
[11:46:05] <theBrettman> you can't call that till document ready
[11:46:21] <fraxture> ahhhh
[11:46:33] <Seanmcn> aaronmcadam : thank you so much
[11:46:42] <aaronmcadam> np
[11:46:50] <fraxture> meaning it needs to be... jquery(document)...
[11:46:51] <fraxture> ?
[11:47:39] <theBrettman> you have to use (document).ready(function(){}); cuz jquery isn't available yet
[11:48:12] <theBrettman> no, you would use straight javascript cuz jQuery is the same as $. neither is available till jQuery is run
[11:48:15] <Marco-123> theBrettman: http://pastebin.com/CU1bsW8Z thats my code. its for jsTree
[11:48:35] <joshualibrarian> If I remove an item from the DOM, what happens to it's click handlers?
[11:48:37] <theBrettman> what you should do is move all your scripts to the bottom of the page below jquery
[11:48:42] <Marco-123> any help would be greatly appreciated
[11:49:00] <destryalhmns> marco
[11:49:13] <destryalhmns> ....ive used jstree and i hate it
[11:49:14] <fraxture> ahh ok
[11:49:15] <theBrettman> is there any reason you can't move your scripts below jquery, fraxture
[11:49:18] <destryalhmns> dynatree
[11:49:34] <fraxture> yeah the only reason is that this is a wpblog and that script comes in a widget...
[11:49:56] <destryalhmns> dynatree actually works
[11:50:13] <Marco-123> destryalhmns: i was thinking about that. i think now is the point to switch
[11:50:22] <destryalhmns> seriolsy do it
[11:50:33] <Marco-123> ok destryalhmns ive heard that more than a few times
[11:50:37] <destryalhmns> i spent 2 weeks trying to make jstree work
[11:50:40] <Marco-123> thanks for being the catalyst
[11:50:44] <theBrettman> um, I would think you return the php data and run jstree on it
[11:51:21] <Marco-123> destryalhmns: maybe you can provide some insight.
[11:51:33] <destryalhmns> jstree makes it impossible to attach event handlers to individual nodes
[11:51:39] <destryalhmns> if you can ever get that far
[11:52:06] <theBrettman> what's the php look like?
[11:52:31] <Marco-123> my problem here is that, when jstree creates a new node, i need to write it to my db. no problem. however, the ID is generated by the db write, so then i need to GET THAT and replace the new jstree node id with the actual db one
[11:52:39] <Marco-123> thnk thats any easier in dynatree
[11:52:57] <destryalhmns> dynatree is easier
[11:53:11] <gloomer> destryalhmns jstree can attach event handlers to nodes
[11:53:18] <destryalhmns> no it cant
[11:53:24] <Marco-123> hmm. well i have to switch even because its still supported while jstree hasnt been touched in a year
[11:53:36] <theBrettman> there is a php function for getting the id of a newly created record
[11:53:38] <gloomer> .bind("select_node.jstree", function (event, data)
[11:54:21] <destryalhmns> i promise, jstree needs to die
[11:54:30] <destryalhmns> dynatree works, lets all move on
[11:54:47] <theBrettman> so does yui tree, lol
[11:55:00] <theBrettman> but they all work different
[11:55:19] <theBrettman> I've only used yui tree so...
[11:55:20] <Marco-123> theBrettman: getting the id back isnt the problem. finding the newly created jstree node is (without the object passed from the original function)
[11:55:52] <Marco-123> im gonna try dynatree
[11:56:01] <theBrettman> ok then
[12:03:10] <destryalhmns> dynatree! dynatree! dynatree!
[12:08:02] <devmikey> WHat would http://pastebin.com/ke5U2XHL do?
[12:08:20] <intellilogic> I'm having a case of the sunndayyss....  if($('[name="lbltr_type"]').val == "SLT"){console.log("SLT");}  <--?
[12:08:54] <devmikey> intellilogic: Where I'm from you'd get your ass kicked for saying something like that
[12:08:55] <intellilogic> It's not returning SLT, how am I supposed to write that if $(selector)value == "foo"?
[12:09:12] <destryalhmns> put a picutre in logo?
[12:09:16] <destryalhmns> do it man
[12:09:27] <theBrettman> you know, I just realized, I don't have to use an iframe... but how can I get the body of a page and display it in a div?
[12:09:30] <destryalhmns> except it wouldnt
[12:09:42] <devmikey> yeah, apparently it wouldnt
[12:09:49] <destryalhmns> because if you could do value on images or backgrounds people would already be doing it
[12:10:14] <devmikey> .src then?
[12:10:25] <destryalhmns> thats what i would do
[12:10:41] <destryalhmns> or do it in a sprite or something... sprites are cool in 2012
[12:11:02] <gloomer> ohh sprites
[12:11:22] <devmikey> I think I found a way to get around doing ?Timestamp
[12:11:34] <devmikey> Or does that do that behind the scenes
[12:12:07] <robertcarter> Hi all, new to jQuery and have a question if you'd be so kind.    How do I apply in a single block of code mouse-event driven behavior to a bunch of elements in a class such that hovering/clicking etc on one doesn't activate the behavior for all elements?
[12:12:08] <devmikey> (I used to do $("#Logo").attr("src", "/images/logo.png.php"+'?'+Date.now());  )
[12:12:27] <intellilogic> Whats wrong with this?  if($('[name="lbltr_type"]').val == "SLT"){
[12:13:08] <atula> .val() ?
[12:13:13] <intellilogic> ^
[12:13:38] <intellilogic> Thanks, I just woke up, not thinking straight
[12:13:42] <destryalhmns> if you $(selector) it effects all elements that match the selector
[12:13:44] <theBrettman> ?p @ robertcarter
[12:13:44] <bot-t> robertcarter, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:14:31] <robertcarter> @bot-t will do
[12:14:32] <devmikey> atula: THat's what the original code I copied for used
[12:14:40] <devmikey> didnt know what to change
[12:14:45] <theBrettman> lol, he's talking to the bot
[12:15:03] <MariusKarthaus> I'm selecting N dom nodes and call fadeOut() on the selection. All of those fadeOuts fire their own callback once ready, i want to 'group' those callback together and fire a single callback once all the objects have faded out. What it the 'jquery-way' to do that ?
[12:15:05] <destryalhmns> im talking to text
[12:15:15] <robertcarter> ah fool me once. :P
[12:15:26] <destryalhmns> ask a question, i have the answer, speed of light 186,000 mps
[12:15:36] <gloomer> speed of sound?
[12:15:44] <destryalhmns> 627?
[12:15:48] <atula> robertcarter: you're probably thinking of event delegation where you bound to parent element and then check if the event is affecting a certain selector inside that parent element... there are perhaps a few ways to skin the cats, but it mostly starts with understanding the event structure... once you got it, it shouldn't be a big deal.
[12:15:52] <destryalhmns> 729! 729!
[12:15:59] <gloomer> :)
[12:16:02] <destryalhmns> churches
[12:16:07] <toothr> speed of light?
[12:16:07] <atula> robertcarter: pasting markups (html) and your js is also a good start too.
[12:16:12] <theBrettman> atula, there's no way to know what he's really trying to do till we see the code
[12:16:33] <theBrettman> robertcarter, that's why we need you to use jsfiddle
[12:16:37] <lacrymology> I'm doing some stuff on $(document).ready that depends on image sizes, and apparently that doesn't wait for all images to be loaded, so my dom element sizes get all messed up, any ways of walking around that?
[12:16:42] <robertcarter> ok, so pls bear with me, where should I paste said code?
[12:16:46] <Krinkle> devmikey: Just an unrelated side note, I'd recommend never using case sensitive IDs and classes. i.e. use #logo instead of #Logo
[12:16:55] <theBrettman> there are many different ways to do things depending on what you're trying to do
[12:17:08] <theBrettman> jsfiddle.com
[12:17:15] <atula> robertcarter: try pastie.org or jsfiddle.com
[12:17:17] <theBrettman> preferably
[12:17:28] <robertcarter> ok
[12:17:31] <theBrettman> never tried the pastie yet
[12:17:49] <theBrettman> yuck, no likey pastie
[12:17:54] <sodhi> Is there any way I can use .animate() and toggle to mimic the effects of minimizing within most OS (particularly, Windows 7)? Basically it defaults to toggle towards the upper left corner, can I change that?
[12:17:55] <atula> http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:17:57] <theBrettman> fiddles r way better
[12:17:59] <devmikey> How does http://pastebin.com/TG570E8C work?
[12:18:05] <devmikey> I'd like to understand that
[12:19:04] <gloomer> devmikey calls ajax replaces src with returned value
[12:19:09] <theBrettman> devmikey, look up the functions it uses
[12:19:23] <devmikey> i have
[12:19:31] <devmikey> I still dont understand
[12:19:38] <Marco-123> destryalhmns: dynatree. up and running in....5 min? amazing
[12:19:54] <destryalhmns> lol ^yeshhhhh
[12:20:01] <theBrettman> cool
[12:20:04] <devmikey> I think I understand .attr but caching was preventing it from working
[12:20:16] <destryalhmns> easy and now you can get real stuff done
[12:20:22] <atula> devmikey: I cringed a little... I'm still under the assumption that dataType: Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)
[12:20:28] <destryalhmns> jstree is all about blowing itself
[12:21:17] <devmikey> .ajax appears to generally be about making ajax calls, as in something that .attr might call itself to handle the request I made of it
[12:21:39] <atula> devmikey: it seems a little "odd" in my opinion... but it seems like you'd just need to do set the caching on the server side and then set the src in the markup...
[12:21:57] <atula> again... it's in my opinion but the piece of codes you're showing is quite odd.
[12:22:03] <devmikey> It works
[12:22:10] <devmikey> whereas neither part worked alone
[12:22:56] <atula> in term of understanding it... it's just doing an ajax call to backend... grab the image that would generate the image... THEN setting the src would work.
[12:23:16] <atula> that's why without the ajax generating it... it wouldn't work...
[12:23:26] <atula> oh gosh... that's weird... it shouldn't work that way...
[12:23:37] <atula> let's start from the beginning
[12:23:43] <atula> what is the problem you're trying to solve?
[12:23:46] <atula> devmikey: ^
[12:24:12] <devmikey> I was trying to do the equivalent of:
[12:24:27] <devmikey> $("#Logo").attr("src", "/images/logo.png.php"+'?'+Date.now());
[12:24:30] <devmikey> some other way
[12:24:59] <devmikey> That code seems straightforward to me
[12:25:00] <atula> logo.png.php what does that do?
[12:25:09] <devmikey> it generates an image
[12:25:13] <atula> yah.. it should be straight forward
[12:25:21] <atula> so that just generate the image
[12:25:30] <atula> can you go to it via the url and the image shows up?
[12:25:37] <techouse> devmikey you're mixing double quotes and single quotes together up there
[12:25:41] <devmikey> That code does yes, and it works
[12:25:43] <atula> as in go to browser... enter permanent url
[12:25:51] <atula> and an image shows up?
[12:25:54] <devmikey> yes
[12:26:20] <atula> alright. what about <img src="/img/logo.png.php" />
[12:26:22] <atula> that's not working?
[12:26:26] <devmikey> the "problem" was only that I dont like doing that Date.now bullshit
[12:26:40] <atula> you're trying to do cache busting?
[12:26:43] <devmikey> Yes
[12:26:51] <atula> -_-
[12:26:55] <atula> heh
[12:27:02] <devmikey> And that ajax thing apparently does it too
[12:27:08] <atula> I know I know
[12:27:14] <atula> but I think it's silly to do it that way
[12:27:20] <atula> why not generate the cache busting in the backend?
[12:27:29] <atula> are you using a framework or just straight up php?
[12:27:40] <devmikey> All I wanna know is, does it do ?Date.now() or something similar behind the scenes
[12:27:45] <devmikey> stright php
[12:27:50] <koulchilebaiz> hey all, i would like to know if its possible to do that : http://www.lateralcode.com/slideshow-with-buttons/  but replace the buttons with images and place it where ever i want on the page ?
[12:27:54] <devmikey> I tried doing cache busting via the headers
[12:27:58] <devmikey> nothing owrked
[12:28:01] <devmikey> worked*
[12:28:24] <devmikey> that logo.png.php has about 5 headers saying, "Dont cache this, asshole"
[12:28:41] <atula> you can just generate the <img id="Logo" src="/img/logo.png.php?<?php Date function echo here>" /> (don't mind the quote problem)
[12:28:56] <atula> you don't want to do that?
[12:28:56] <devmikey> cache control, pragma, expires
[12:29:04] <devmikey> no I dont
[12:29:22] <atula> alrighty then.
[12:29:46] <robertcarter> Ok, pasted code in pastie.org   http://pastie.org/3278060
[12:33:26] <devmikey> Besides a style issue IMO, it also makes traffic analysis a pain if you sometimes want to view different GET vars as distinct links
[12:33:41] <atula> well, devmikey... I think you're using javascript to solve the problem a bit awkwardly as you can do a timestamp in the backend to deal with the cache the darn thing. but I understand you want to do things your way so all I cay say regarding your question is that the ajax call you're making is simply generating the image again and place it in the browser cache I think
[12:35:58] <destryalhmns> jquery is in desperate need of new recruits who care about archaic js
[12:36:51] <atula> destryalhmns: oh? I'd love to hear more about what you think.
[12:36:53] <atula> do share
[12:37:02] <destryalhmns> k
[12:37:10] <destryalhmns> well i think the government is insane
[12:37:21] <destryalhmns> i think child support is harmful to children
[12:37:23] <atula> the government of js?
[12:37:32] <destryalhmns> and i think jquery is slower than straight js
[12:37:39] <destryalhmns> and
[12:37:41] <atula> I was under the assumption that we're dealing with archaic js thoughts
[12:37:52] <destryalhmns> i have some awesome ideas abou the future of the internet
[12:38:10] <gloomer> ohh me too :)
[12:38:11] <devmikey> I have some dirty thoughts
[12:38:21] <atula> destryalhmns: most frameworks do have overheads but you are sacrificing one thing for others... and the arguments have been made countless times with many frameworks in many other languages
[12:38:23] <gloomer> i think it will get censored and distributed
[12:38:27] <destryalhmns> jq vs js : http://www.seanmchugh.info/compare.htm
[12:38:41] <destryalhmns> ive posted that like 5 times on irc but its worth posting
[12:38:49] <robertcarter> @atula, thanks for the direction.  Cheers :)
[12:39:02] <atula> jquery is a javascript framework I thought
[12:39:11] <devmikey> destryalhmns: Well anyone can suck my nutz if they want me to do ajax with straight JS
[12:39:44] <destryalhmns> no no
[12:39:54] <destryalhmns> ajax with straight js might be difficult
[12:39:57] <atula> robertcarter: your codes seem to be quite rough... tell me what you're trying to do. describe it in normal english using your elements
[12:40:26] <destryalhmns> i was just pointing something out. ....network time and db hits are probably the real bottleneck
[12:40:31] <atula> devmikey: I'm an older kid here... but I bet there are other younger folks in here.. could we keep the language to a nicer tone? thank you
[12:40:50] <destryalhmns> does anyone else get so tired of being upfront that they just dont care anymore?
[12:41:02] <atula> destryalhmns:db hits?
[12:41:07] <destryalhmns> atula, no
[12:41:08] <atula> destryalhmns: dont' care about what?
[12:41:12] <destryalhmns> i have been booted here before
[12:41:24] <chee> i should fix my irc so i don't get highlighted when people says cheers
[12:41:26] <atula> destryalhmns: relax... we've all been there
[12:41:35] <atula> chee: cheers :)
[12:41:41] <chee> :D
[12:41:44] <destryalhmns> i have a gay older brother and i have called im gay to his face and even asked him what he thought and he said as long as i wasnt being personally offensive
[12:42:05] <robertcarter> hehe.  I have a bunch of questions on a page.  You click on the text that is the question and below it expands a video.    So I'd rather avoid duplication of having to specify each and every question/video combo.
[12:42:06] <atula> destryalhmns: I'm a bit confused... this is a jquery channel :)
[12:42:11] <destryalhmns> so if you dont lie the word gay invent a pascal time machine... in my opinion
[12:42:17] <chee> destryalhmns: everybody is not your older brother
[12:42:31] <chee> this is a tip that will help you in all of your life
[12:42:38] <atula> robertcarter: oh okay. let's see. you want to think about it like this. your markups has to be in synch of course...
[12:42:42] <someprimetime> how about let's keep all offtopic discussion out of #jquery?
[12:42:43] <destryalhmns> well he is gay... and i asked him if it was okay to say gay.. and he said yes
[12:42:50] <ApeShot> Hi #jquery - I'm sort of a noob - is this a reasonable place to ask questions?
[12:42:57] <someprimetime> ?offtopic @ destryalhmns
[12:42:57] <bot-t> destryalhmns, While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of  is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[12:43:05] <chee> atula: there is the benefit that i get highlighted anytime somebody is talking about cheerleaders
[12:43:06] <gloomer> robertcarter use children etc selectors
[12:43:09] <destryalhmns> fine
[12:43:10] <gloomer> easy peasy :)
[12:43:15] <gloomer> sure ApeShot
[12:43:16] <ApeShot> I've read through "Jquery Compressed" but now that I look into my client's source code there are queries I don't recognize
[12:43:17] <gloomer> noobs welcome
[12:43:31] <gloomer> such as...
[12:43:32] <ApeShot> eg: what does $("</select >") do
[12:43:44] <ApeShot> Or rather, why would someone write it this way?
[12:43:52] <atula> yeah... I'm all for talking about other stuff but there are quite a few others needing jquery help... which is distracting when we're all trying to help them
[12:44:03] <ApeShot> It seems to grab all the select elements
[12:44:11] <ApeShot> But why write it such?
[12:44:36] <atula> ApeShot: $() actually generate DOM element on the fly too... although what you have there is a bit weird $('<select />')
[12:44:48] <atula> would be more like create a select element
[12:45:11] <robertcarter> @atula, ok, I go read now thanks again :)
[12:45:14] <ApeShot> Could you elaborate?  We are actually having some issues with mysterious elements appearing
[12:46:38] <theBrettman> anyone know a way I could get the contents of a page and display it in a div without an iframe?
[12:46:43] <lacrymology> ApeShot: you can create an element by doing $("<tag></tag>"), or $("<tag />") ( $("</tag>") doesn't seem to work on my chrome)
[12:46:49] <theBrettman> like I just want what's in the body
[12:46:59] <lacrymology> ApeShot: it won't get added to the DOM tree automatically, tho
[12:47:03] <atula> robertcarter: basically you want to do something like... when I act on 1 element, I should be able to get to ther elements using the information I already have from this element... using traversal, attribute etc.  $('.question').hover(function () { $(this).find('.answer').show();}, ... something liket hat
[12:47:26] <theBrettman> nvm, I think I will use json
[12:47:45] <atula> theBrettman: good idea... there's also .load but json is a fine thing to do
[12:47:57] <devmikey> Krinkle: Just for that, I'm ucfirsting all my class names too from now on
[12:48:14] <devmikey> How you like me now?
[12:48:40] <Krinkle> devmikey: I'd fire you on first opportunity ;-)
[12:48:44] <joshualibrarian> How can I get all the active event handlers on a page?
[12:49:07] <Krinkle> devmikey: And will laugh every time you're spending 10 minutes debugging to find you forgot a ucfirst somewhere
[12:49:25] <Krinkle> anyway, I honestly don't care how you do your stuff. Just personal preference :)
[12:49:27] <ApeShot> lacrymology: I've located the related portion of the jquery docs
[12:49:37] <ApeShot> lacrymology: thanks, it as a hint, but it was helpful, I think
[12:50:03] <devmikey> Krinkle: I will be crediting you as my muse
[12:50:40] <atula> joshualibrarian: that would be a bit intensive... what is the problem you're trying to solve? there is .data('events') or something like that.. let's look
[12:52:07] <joshualibrarian> atula:  I have a situation where I have links on a set of div's which I switch out between eachother.
[12:52:13] <Krinkle> devmikey: lovely ;-)
[12:52:47] <atula> joshualibrarian: so you want events to work on the new links?
[12:53:09] <atula> I got to run, but perhaps you're looking at something like .delegate/.live I'm guessing
[12:53:25] <atula> play nice everyone
[12:53:29] <joshualibrarian> atula:  thanks, I'll try that direction.
[12:59:39] <ApeShot> suppose I create some elements using $('<select />')
[12:59:46] <ApeShot> And later want to select them?
[12:59:52] <ApeShot> What sort of query would suffice?
[13:10:10] <ApeShot> Do I have to do anything to find elements whose class attribute is a string with many elements seperated by spaces?
[13:10:37] <ApeShot> And I want to find all elements which match, including those which match just one of the space-delimited elements in the class field?
[13:11:03] <ApeShot> or does $('.classname') suffice
[13:11:19] <ApeShot> It doesn't seem to, but I admit to a significant ignorance in this area
[13:12:50] <atula> ApeShot: are you trying to select an element that has more than 1 class?  $('.class1') would work $('.class1.class2') means only classes 1 that has class2
[13:13:08] <atula> ApeShot: should be pretty straight forward depends on your cases.
[13:14:08] <ApeShot> atula: That is what I thought
[13:14:13] <ApeShot> atula: thanks, though
[13:22:38] <theBrettman> atula, check this out: http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
[13:22:41] <PeterPan-> what is the best approach building a menu based on different states?
[13:23:30] <theBrettman> I found something the other day that uses it but I can't remember what...
[13:24:11] <atula> theBrettman: I am a simple man
[13:25:32] <theBrettman> yeah, it was something simple...
[13:25:37] <theBrettman> grr. wish I could remember
[13:27:58] <nFFF> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null
[13:27:59] <nFFF> jQuery('.wrapper').load('http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/staging/index.php/checkout/cart/');
[13:28:11] <nFFF> anyone know why Chrome is throwing this error
[13:28:16] <nFFF> and why the page is crashing
[13:28:19] <nFFF> beucase of the above code
[13:30:55] <theBrettman> it's trying to set innerHTML of something it can't find
[13:31:59] <nFFF> theBrettman, does that mean it can't find .wrapper or the url?
[13:32:53] <theBrettman> .wrapper
[13:33:35] <theBrettman> it's trying to set the innerHTML of .wrapper
[13:33:59] <theBrettman> but it can't find any .wrapper
[13:35:17] <nFFF> but .wrapper definately exists
[13:35:22] <nFFF> So I'm perplexed
[13:36:15] <theBrettman> you'll figure it out, I've been there, lol
[13:36:28] <nFFF> the code is literally: jQuery('.wrapper').append('<span class="lightbox"></span>'); jQuery('.wrapper').load('http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/staging/index.php/checkout/cart/');
[13:36:37] <nFFF> it appens .lightbox fine
[13:36:40] <theBrettman> and it will be followed by a facepalm when u do usually
[13:36:42] <nFFF> then throws that error
[13:37:05] <nFFF> I think perhaps its the destination url
[13:37:55] <theBrettman> you can't chain btw... instead of doing jQuery('.wrapper').load() you can just pint the .load() to jQuery('.wrapper').append('<span class="lightbox"></span>')
[13:38:22] <theBrettman> like: jQuery('.wrapper').append('<span class="lightbox"></span>').load('http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/staging/index.php/checkout/cart/');
[13:38:52] <theBrettman> save ya 8char
[13:39:22] <nFFF> hanks
[13:40:17] <nFFF> Same error though
[13:40:24] <nFFF> I really don't get it
[13:40:54] <nFFF> It's appending the html, and then trying to tell me the element doesn't exist?
[13:42:00] <theBrettman> idk but it would replace what you appended
[13:42:16] <stew-a> the getJSON api page says 'If the URL includes the string "callback=?" (or similar...', does that mean if i request example.com/blah?jsonp=? that jquery will use jsonp to provide the callback on it's own or do i need to tell it somehow that the jsonp wrapper name goes in the jsonp get variable?
[13:42:49] <theBrettman> if u append() in .wrapper and then html() .wrapper, the html() will replace all contents of .wrapper
[13:45:09] <nFFF> theBrettman, that'd be fine f it actually worked
[13:45:17] <nFFF> but it's not loading the new html
[13:45:42] <theBrettman> I'll have to see an example ?p @ nFFF
[13:46:32] <theBrettman> ?p @ nFFF
[13:46:32] <bot-t> nFFF, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[13:49:01] <ish10> hey guys I have a neat problem. I am receiving a string of a HTML form element. Any cool ways to create a form from it?
[13:50:31] <dabear> ish10: $(yourstring).appendTo("#somewhere")
[13:50:57] <ish10> dabear, woah didnt expect that would work. Cool browsers. I'll try it on a <div> tag
[13:52:56] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/M4ZLm/
[13:58:29] <grkblood> im having an issue at joeshowradio.com where if you scroll over LOGIN and click in the username field and get a dropdown list generated from your cache then scroll over the list the parent div will disappear because the browser thinks my mouse has scrolled off the div. does anyone know how to fix this?
[14:00:09] <johnkpaul> grkblood: that does not happen in chrome or FF on osx
[14:00:18] <johnkpaul> what browsers are you seeing this problem for
[14:00:26] <grkblood> it happens in FF for me

[14:02:00] <grkblood> johnkpaul, did you get a list generated from your cache?
[14:02:03] <johnkpaul> yeah
[14:02:10] <grkblood> hrm
[14:02:14] <johnkpaul> when you say cache, you mean the usernames I use on other sites, right?
[14:02:19] <grkblood> ya
[14:02:23] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/M4ZLm/ theBrettman
[14:02:26] <nFFF> ANY IDEAS?
[14:02:27] <grkblood> whats the technical name for that generate list
[14:02:29] <johnkpaul> then yes, have you tried adding a delay?
[14:02:33] <grkblood> generated*
[14:02:39] <johnkpaul> form autofill
[14:02:44] <johnkpaul> (I think)
[14:03:36] <grkblood> johnkpaul, thats my current code http://pastebin.com/7c84PjpM
[14:03:45] <grkblood> where do you suggest i add a delay?
[14:04:00] <grkblood> oops
[14:04:04] <grkblood> pastebin messed that up
[14:05:55] <johnkpaul> grkblood: in mouseleave
[14:06:22] <grkblood> thanks, that worked
[14:06:27] <grkblood> i wonder why though
[14:06:39] <grkblood> actually
[14:06:49] <johnkpaul> you could try http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[14:06:51] <grkblood> that might not have worked
[14:06:52] <grkblood> one sec
[14:07:00] <johnkpaul> I always use that instead of manually figuring out mouseleave and mouseenter
[14:31:35] <lsone> I'm having problems adding nested divs to a document in JQuery Mobile =/
[14:32:04] <lsone> I can get listitems and list view.refresh to work dynamically without a problem
[14:32:34] <lsone> but when they are created i am also wanting div's that create inline pages to be added to the end of the document
[14:33:01] <lsone> i've tried appending to the body, appending to new div tags that I class/id separately, and nothing is working
[14:33:34] <lsone> and i've tried variations of .append, .appendTo, and .html

[14:38:30] <aaronmcadam> josh9: you don't need a ; at the end of a block
[14:38:33] <lsone> Eviltwin: By what I am reading, append *should* do the trick, but it just isn't
[14:38:38] <aaronmcadam> }; is invalid josh9
[14:38:47] <josh9> aaronmcadam: oh. thank you
[14:39:05] <aaronmcadam> use jsfiddle so we can be sure ur code doesn't have syntax errors
[14:39:25] <collinIII> comparison of extensions for libraries does jquery have a widget extension comparable to digit
[14:39:29] <collinIII> dijit
[14:39:53] <josh9> aaronmcadam: are u talking to me regarding jsfiddle?
[14:39:53] <aaronmcadam> you mean jquery ui?
[14:39:57] <aaronmcadam> and the widget factory
[14:40:00] <aaronmcadam> yeah josh9

[14:40:27] <josh9> aaronmcadam: i was not sure how to paste it into jsfiddle, since it's only the template.
[14:40:43] <aaronmcadam> it's not hard to include sources

[14:41:35] <josh9> ok. btw, how do u validate your js? external website or an editor extension?

[14:47:25] <aaronmcadam> don't you know about SOP?
[14:47:33] <aaronmcadam> ?sop @ nFFF
[14:47:34] <bot-t> nFFF, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop

[14:48:04] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/gLU7T/
[14:48:14] <lsone> There it is
[14:48:46] <lsone> I commented out the phone gap stuff, but that part was working as far as I could tell, unless I am trying to do these appends at the wrong time
[14:49:23] <lsone> the list part works like a champ, the page part, no matter how i twist it, break it apart, whatever, it will not create the page divs
[14:49:47] <aaronmcadam> are u trying to create data-role pages?
[14:49:51] <lsone> right
[14:50:03] <lsone> 1 index.html with multiple pages embedded, created dynamically
[14:50:15] <aaronmcadam> ok
[14:50:28] <aaronmcadam> are you sure you're not appending ur pages /inside/ a data-role container?
[14:50:55] <lsone> the .append SHOULD be going to the end of the "body", if i am looking at that right
[14:51:07] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:51:13] <lsone> which would mean after the last div
[14:51:15] <aaronmcadam> and then are you triggering refresh on that?
[14:51:27] <lsone> how do i refresh after that append?
[14:51:34] <aaronmcadam> it's chainable
[14:51:41] <aaronmcadam> trigger('refresh')
[14:52:24] <aaronmcadam> sorry
[14:52:27] <aaronmcadam> it's         .trigger( 'create' );
[14:52:31] <nFFF> aaronmcadam, basically Im adding a class ligthbox to the DOM and trying to load a page
[14:52:36] <nFFF> but i's throwing that error
[14:52:40] <nFFF> any ideas
[14:52:51] <nFFF> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null -> lightbox does exist
[14:52:54] <aaronmcadam> why are u pulling in data from another domain?
[14:53:05] <nFFF> it's the same domain on my site
[14:53:10] <aaronmcadam> you can't do that
[14:53:23] <nFFF> it's same site just different page
[14:53:40] <aaronmcadam> get rid of that load
[14:53:50] <lsone> triggering create made my list disappear
[14:54:03] <aaronmcadam> what about refresh?
[14:54:11] <nFFF> basically, I'm loading a lightbox (just a white background), and trying to load the 'cart' page from the site into he ligthbox
[14:54:19] <nFFF> Whats the best way to do this?
[14:54:26] <nFFF> I thought load() was what I wanted?
[14:54:37] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna keep getting errors on jsfiddle because of SOP
[14:55:04] <nFFF> sure
[14:55:08] <lsone> actually, that append itself makes my list disappear, forgot i had it commented out while i cleaned up my list view
[14:55:11] <nFFF> But I'm getting them on my site
[14:55:15] <lsone> even without the trigger it disappears
[14:55:23] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:55:24] <lsone> if i comment out the append, the list shows up
[14:55:26] <aaronmcadam> of course u are
[14:55:34] <nFFF> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null is from the live site
[14:55:49] <aaronmcadam> that's not the point
[14:56:17] <nFFF> whats the point then? :>
[14:56:31] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/M4ZLm/1/
[14:56:34] <nFFF> Im just lost as what to do, it should work
[14:57:08] <aaronmcadam> you need delegation
[14:57:29] <nFFF> can you expand on that
[14:58:37] <aaronmcadam> nFFF http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/M4ZLm/3/
[14:59:28] <nFFF> ok and where would the load go?
[14:59:44] <aaronmcadam> where i appended "something"
[14:59:56] <nFFF> It throws the error though
[15:00:14] <aaronmcadam> i don't get why ur using a span either
[15:00:25] <spersaud> what are some good sites to make a logo ?
[15:01:26] <aaronmcadam> nFFF have u copied the new code
[15:02:05] <nFFF> yes
[15:02:13] <aaronmcadam> myfirstlogo.com
[15:02:22] <aaronmcadam> fisherpricewebsite.com
[15:02:50] <nFFF> Exact same result
[15:02:50] <samuelvasy> Hi. Can someone give some help to me. I have table rows that I want to toggle. Everything else works nice, but I also have links in few cells, which I want to exluce. How I can do that?
[15:02:56] <nFFF> page crashes
[15:03:01] <nFFF> and get the null error

[15:04:20] <nFFF> Or perhaps the null error doesn't load now, but page crashes and the background goes white
[15:24:22] <theBrettman> why did jquery use end() instead of pop()?
[15:29:08] <coldhead> it's not a pop, theBrettman
[15:29:18] <coldhead> it's more like an undo()
[15:33:28] <chee> coldhead: from api.jquery.com 'If we need an older element set, we can use end() to pop the sets back off of the stack.'
[15:33:33] <chee> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
[15:39:17] <coldhead> chee: those docs are misleading
[15:39:23] <coldhead> the stack is jQuery internals
[15:39:33] <coldhead> from the USER'S point of view it is an undo
[15:41:03] <theBrettman> what does pop() then, coldhead?
[15:41:54] <coldhead> ?eval [1,2,"lol","aids"].pop()
[15:41:59] <bot-t> coldhead: "aids"
[15:42:36] <systemfault> ?eval var x = [1,2,"lol","aids"]; x.pop(); x;
[15:42:38] <bot-t> systemfault: [1, 2, "lol"]
[15:42:50] <systemfault> (Might help you to understand it better)
[15:43:38] <coldhead> ?eval $('<code>lol</code><code>aids</code>').pop()
[15:43:39] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: div is undefined
[15:43:45] <coldhead> >: |
[15:43:47] <theBrettman> oh, there is a pop()?
[15:43:57] <coldhead> $() returns something arraylike
[15:44:05] <coldhead> so you can call the array pop method
[15:44:13] <coldhead> never seen it used in practice though
[15:44:20] <coldhead> but it's my first day using jQuery
[15:44:36] <systemfault> Of course.
[15:45:17] <theBrettman> weird. I couldn't find pop() in the dox
[15:45:25] <coldhead> it's not jQuery
[15:45:28] <coldhead> it's javascript
[15:45:29] <theBrettman> ohhhh
[15:45:32] <coldhead> ?mdc pop
[15:45:33] <bot-t> coldhead, pop - MDN - Removes the last element from an array and returns that element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop
[15:47:03] <theBrettman> but I guess pop() is prolly called by some jquery functions
[15:47:15] <coldhead> oh no doubt
[15:47:58] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/gLU7T/ any clues as to why my pageCreate isn't working?
[15:48:14] <coldhead> 5 times
[15:48:45] <lsone> on the actual phone gap app that append for pageCreate actually causes my list to disappear as well
[15:52:39] <kristofer91> hello everyone
[15:52:50] <kristofer91> i'm in a bit of a freaking situation
[15:53:14] <oojacoboo> the jquery forums look like a bbs from the 50s
[15:53:15] <kristofer91> My site is being scanned as having a malware, so i will not ask you to go on it :P, but i think it is coming from a js file being loaded somewhere and i can see it in the header
[15:53:28] <kristofer91> but when looking in the header file, that script is no where to be find
[15:53:51] <kristofer91> so i'm guessing that malware shit or whatever is injecting it in the header i guess o.O kinda lost, but how can i track the source of that js file ?
[15:53:58] <techouse> does anyone here have any experience with jquery + ajax + history?
[15:54:04] <pifantastic> lsone: I2 things
[15:54:06] <pifantastic> 2 things*
[15:54:16] <pifantastic> lsone: 1) You are closing the page div early
[15:54:45] <pifantastic> lsone: 2) It's working, but JQM only shows 1 data-role="page" at a time, if you want to see the second page, you have to explicitly show it
[15:55:04] <StyxLT> hi everyone :) I want to constrain a draggable element to a div#container once it reaches it. basically i've got a list of draggable elements and when a user drags it around and reaches #container I wan't to restrict the draggable area to that #container div, but untill the user reaches it - it doesn't constrain the movement, what's the simplesest way to do it?
[15:55:19] <pifantastic> kristofer91: are you displaying data from a database?
[15:55:53] <kristofer91> it's a wordpress site
[15:56:05] <lsone> pifantastic: i forgot to update the jsfiddle on the closing the div, i had moved those around when i was trying to do multiple appends based on divs. so those divs are closed properly now
[15:56:16] <kristofer91> and from using firebug, and the site that scanned my website
[15:56:17] <lsone> pifantastic: shouldn't clicking the li associated to it, show it?
[15:56:35] <lsone> when i take it out of the function and just paste that html back into the page itself, it shows up just fine
[15:56:45] <pifantastic> lsone: it's working for me
[15:56:51] <kristofer91> it showed me the javascript code and i found it in the header of the site, but once i'm looking into the header.php file i cannot find it so i'm wondering how i can find the source of the javascript being loaded from
[15:57:03] <pifantastic> lsone: once I fixed the closing div
[15:57:29] <pifantastic> kristofer91: show us the contents of your header.php file
[15:57:56] <lsone> which i have commented out around the function calls on that jsfiddle
[15:58:36] <pifantastic> lsone: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/gLU7T/1/
[15:59:19] <StyxLT> anyone? :/
[15:59:48] <lsone> ^^ got that working on jsfiddle as well. i think it has to do with the .live or page create part.
[16:03:37] <StyxLT> nevermind :)
[16:09:02] <lsone> yea, 'document not found' still popping up on the sim and device. meh.
[16:11:14] <lsone> bbl
[16:20:25] <Agbeladem> I'm basically puting a lot of data on a hidden div that is shown on $(document).ready. The problem a lot of facebook like iframe of plugins are inside it and $(document).ready is called 10 seconds after the page has started loading. What would you recommend ?
[16:20:42] <xsamurai> anybody using jquery validate know how I can remove or not have the default generate label tags http://dpaste.com/694916/
[16:21:52] <theBrettman> guyz, how to I get a url from a text for load? ie: $('#canvas').load('$fileURL body');
[16:22:28] <theBrettman> I set the $fileURL to the val of the text input
[16:22:43] <theBrettman> but I don't know the correct syntax to put it in there...
[16:23:55] <theBrettman> tried to find an example... failed! lol
[16:35:45] <rasmusth> can I include a conflict safe jquery from my own javascript?
[16:38:51] <chee> theBrettman: do you mean you've done something along the lines of
[16:39:11] <chee> var $fileURL = $('#lolhiiamatextbox').val()
[16:39:36] <chee> so you want to do, $('#canvas').load($fileURL)
[16:39:51] <eddiemonge> ?noconflict @ rasmusth
[16:39:52] <bot-t> rasmusth, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[16:39:59] <chee> somebody is typing a url into the textbox, is that what is happening?
[16:45:00] <rasmusth> hmmm
[16:48:24] <coldhead> hmmm
[16:52:07] <eddiemonge> hmmm
[16:52:14] <rasmusth> I need to load jquery from my javascript, if it has not yet been loaded
[16:52:36] <rasmusth> http://www.pastie.org/3279357
[16:53:04] <rasmusth> I've made this, but the jquery code isn't actually loaded when it gets to the jquery part, even though it's inserted before this javascript
[16:53:07] <eddiemonge> 1.2.6???
[16:53:58] <rasmusth> version doesnt matter
[16:54:00] <rasmusth> lol
[16:54:06] <chee> lassic
[16:54:06] <eddiemonge> rasmusth: look at https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L54
[16:54:12] <chee> it's a classic
[16:54:38] <coldhead> 1.2.4 is my favourite classic
[16:56:10] <rasmusth> <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/libs/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[16:56:13] <rasmusth> that?
[16:56:38] <rasmusth> I really don't see why that is of use, my conditional is fine
[16:59:37] <eddiemonge> really? is it?
[16:59:45] <eddiemonge> because if it was, you wouldnt be here right?
[17:00:44] <rasmusth> .........
[17:00:51] <rasmusth> please re-read my question
[17:01:08] <chee> now now gentleman let's not get upset
[17:01:15] <chee> gentlement
[17:01:40] <rasmusth> "I've made this, but the jquery code isn't actually loaded when it gets to the jquery part, even though it's inserted before this javascript"
[17:02:04] <eddiemonge> rasmusth: your lines 1-6 are not blocking
[17:02:33] <eddiemonge> "even though it's inserted before this javascript" !== "loaded before this javascript"
[17:02:48] <eddiemonge> hence the "rasmusth: look at https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L54"
[17:03:45] <chee> i feel like i'm watching groundhog day
[17:04:04] <rasmusth> so if I write it to the document, it will be loaded before the next code in my javascript file is executed?
[17:05:21] <eddiemonge> chee: that was on tv yesterday or friday
[17:05:48] <eddiemonge> rasmusth: depends on where it is at and how you are writing it. why cant you do like the example?
[17:10:52] <rasmusth> eddiemonge: it's an api I provide for others
[17:11:10] <eddiemonge> your api is is providing jquery code?
[17:11:23] <rasmusth> yes
[17:12:16] <eddiemonge> thats not optimal
[17:13:00] <rasmusth> I am aware of that
[17:18:54] <lsone> oy back.
[17:18:59] <lsone> and still no luck
[17:19:02] <eddiemonge> yay!
[17:25:06] <coldhead> ?that that @ chee
[17:25:06] <bot-t1> chee, thank a lot yu deserve a great that that
[17:27:53] <chee> thankyou for my that
[17:27:58] <chee> i will wear it proudly
[17:29:05] <coldhead> yu deserve it
[17:30:07] <olarf> hello
[17:30:16] <olarf> i hope to get a little hint here
[17:31:04] <olarf> right now i do my website navigation by switching the content by changing the "display" atribute of certain div-elements inside my index.html
[17:31:30] <olarf> is there a better way to load new content into my page?
[17:32:21] <joshualibrarian> how can i hold off execution of something until another function has finished?
[17:33:04] <chee> olarf: you could use ajax to .load the stuff into the element, but that's not really necessary unless it's a huge amount of content that's being loaded in the page
[17:33:15] <eddiemonge> olarf: thats kind of a loaded question witout more info
[17:33:22] <chee> olarf: .show() and .hide() are good enough and very suitable usually
[17:33:23] <eddiemonge> joshualibrarian: add it as a callback
[17:34:00] <joshualibrarian> eddiemonge:  hm... I already have callbacks, but I have two instances of the same plugin callbacking eachother.  :(
[17:34:25] <eddiemonge> joshualibrarian: then perhaps more info is in order
[17:34:57] <joshualibrarian> hmm... eddiemonge:  you give me an idea though... testing...
[17:35:01] <olarf> ah i see ...
[17:35:14] <chee> ∞
[17:35:44] <olarf> so what is "huge" ?
[17:35:51] <lsone> i want to dynamically add divs with page data-roles, when the page loads, so that when links are clicked they point to the new divs. why won't it work? lol
[17:36:00] <olarf> if i have something like a picture gallery with like 100 pictures
[17:36:05] <olarf> is this already huge?
[17:36:40] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/gLU7T/4/  <-- that works on jsfiddle, but once i uncomment on the page live part for phonegap it no longer works on things like the simulators.
[17:37:38] <olarf> i do have one problem with the ".show() and .hide()" method
[17:38:10] <olarf> if i want to post direct links to certain contant ... i have to make some strange javascript "workarounds" right?
[17:39:04] <pifantastic> olarf: are you talking about anchors?
[17:39:07] <pifantastic> because if so, no
[17:39:09] <pifantastic> that''s just HTML
[17:39:22] <pifantastic> ohh
[17:39:31] <pifantastic> you mean load stuff based on the hashtag
[17:39:33] <pifantastic> probably
[17:39:35] <pifantastic> in which case
[17:39:39] <pifantastic> you do need javascript
[17:39:55] <olarf> lets say i have a page with "home, about, news" or so ..
[17:40:08] <olarf> and then i would like to post a direct link to the "news" page
[17:40:42] <olarf> i did this by http://mywebsite#news
[17:41:01] <olarf> and than i parsed the string after # to find out what content to show
[17:41:16] <olarf> it worked but i dont feel good by doing this kind of stuff ^^
[17:41:41] <olarf> so i thought there has to be a "correct" way
[17:41:43] <lsone> at least you can say 'it worked' lol
[17:41:51] <lsone> better than 'error loading document' D:
[17:42:05] <olarf> hehe no it actually works fine
[17:42:19] <olarf> but i have to do some more webpages now
[17:42:32] <lsone> >.<
[17:42:32] <olarf> and i really dont want to do them all a "wrong way"
[17:43:34] <joshualibrarian> You see.... I have written a slideshow program which creates an instance of a widget and .clones each slide into a collection and doles them out one at a time based on what link is clicked on....
[17:43:45] <joshualibrarian> but the links of ONE instance of the plugin are ON the slides of another.
[17:45:07] <olarf> joshualibrarian: was your answer to me?
[17:45:13] <joshualibrarian> But if the second instance would just WAIT until the first instance is actually loaded and THEN instantiate....
[17:45:28] <olarf> ah ok no ^^
[17:45:32] <joshualibrarian> olarf:  no, pardon, I am ranting about my problem.
[17:46:12] <chee> olarf: you could use the hash anchors as actual named anchors too on the page
[17:46:35] <chee> olarf: and you could use modernizr ( http://modernizr.com/ )
[17:46:38] <olarf> probably it will not help you but if you know how long your first "function" takes you can use setTimeout(); function ^^
[17:46:44] <chee> and set
[17:47:07] <chee> html.no-js .my-sexy-images { display: block }
[17:47:16] <joshualibrarian> olarf: hm.. good as a last resort.  :)
[17:47:23] <chee> so that they are all displayed by default in a list if the person does not have javascript
[17:47:46] <chee> and the anchors will bring them to the one in question
[17:47:57] <chee> but then if they do have javascript, they get a much sexier page
[17:48:03] <chee> full of sexy
[17:48:59] <joshualibrarian> how can I loop to just keep trying until it works?  sounds risky.
[17:49:53] <olarf> chee: i heard about the modernizr thing .. i feel a like it is a little to much isnt it?
[17:50:54] <olarf> joshualibrarian: i dont know about your function .. but is it possible to use a flag variable?
[17:50:59] <chee> yes it probably is too much, if you would only be using that part of the functionality you could do that with a single line of jQuery
[17:51:11] <chee> olarf: on page load make the first thing that runs
[17:51:22] <chee> $('html').removeClass('no-js')
[17:51:30] * joshualibrarian perks up... perhaps...
[17:52:01] <eddiemonge> olarf: you can make your own version of modernizr
[17:52:20] <eddiemonge> chee: thats a bad idea because then you have to wait for jquery to load too. lots of fouc
[17:53:07] <olarf> really guys .. who does not have JS ;)
[17:53:36] <eddiemonge> about 2.5% of worldwide users
[17:53:43] <eddiemonge> dumb phones
[17:53:56] <chee> olarf: i thought by the way you referred to 'strange javascript "workarounds"' that you were concerned about how your page was going to behave for people without javascript
[17:55:45] <chee> most of the people i know browse the web with javascript disabled most of the time. because they are freaks
[17:56:00] <coldhead> those people don't deserve the web
[17:56:13] <chee> i don't think they want it
[17:56:25] <olarf> chee: no i thought with all the new developement in the web-dev department there has to by a "reddy to go" way
[17:56:31] <coldhead> we don't want them either, they are the demographic least likely to enter their credit card details
[17:56:46] <chee> least likely to have credit card details
[17:56:51] <sasori> his, is it correct to add an onsubmit=javascript stuff in within this line? <input type="image" src="images/submit-btn.png" border="0" id="confirmpolicy" disabled="disabled" >
[17:56:55] <sasori> hi*
[17:56:57] <eddiemonge> olarf: "reddy to go" way to do what?
[17:57:12] <chee> they are all using amigas and running unix v1 on their grandmother
[17:57:29] <olarf> having a navigation on a webpage which is fully integrated with JQuery ^^
[17:57:45] <eddiemonge> sasori: inline js is very rarely a good thing
[17:57:56] <sasori> ok
[17:58:08] <eddiemonge> olarf: if you dont care about people who have no js then sure why not. but its so easy to have a nonjs fallback
[17:58:29] <eddiemonge> and if this is for a corporation then having the non-js fallback is crucial so you dont get sued
[17:58:35] <olarf> eddiemonge: i just red about the "no-js" thing .. sounds good to me
[17:58:43] <olarf> i will include this into my boilerplate
[17:59:00] <sasori> thanks eddiemonge
[17:59:39] <eddiemonge> olarf:  you know there already is a boilerplate you can/should use right?
[17:59:57] <olarf> hmm the modernizr?
[18:00:17] <chee> olarf: http://html5boilerplate.com/
[18:00:41] <chee> it includes modernizr in it and has people involved who have exotic admirers
[18:01:17] <olarf> thanks i will take a look .. last time i spend some time exploring different kind of boilerplate stuff for html/css and so on .. but at the end i wrote my own ..
[18:01:52] <olarf> chee: yes exactly this link was where i was looking at the last time
[18:02:00] <olarf> i was not comfortable with it ..
[18:02:06] <olarf> can you really recommend this?
[18:02:21] <chee> olarf: yes. very highly. with all of my might.
[18:03:24] <eddiemonge> olarf: what arent you comfortable with about it? a lot of really smart people have put a lot time into it
[18:03:26] <chee> olarf: watch a couple of the introductory videos, they will calm your nerves and probably improve your dreams
[18:07:35] <olarf> to answer why i was not comfortable:
[18:07:43] <olarf> i did not like the whole css thing
[18:07:57] <eddiemonge> the whole css thing?
[18:08:22] <olarf> yeah i dont want to have to learn what other people have declared in their css
[18:08:29] <olarf> all i need to style i can style myself
[18:08:36] <olarf> so i deleted it ..
[18:08:43] <olarf> and what was left then ?
[18:08:45] <olarf> not to much
[18:08:56] <olarf> an my problem was still not solved
[18:09:08] <eddiemonge> olarf: you know the h5bp css is meant to be a normalizer
[18:09:16] <eddiemonge> and that you can overwrite it.
[18:09:23] <eddiemonge> olarf: what problem do you have
[18:09:48] <olarf> to switch content using jquery
[18:10:04] <olarf> i am not sure if .hide() and .show() is enough
[18:10:14] <chee> olarf: that's normalize.css, it means you know that people will all be looking at pretty much the same thing in most browsers. your styles go after that, with the confidence they will look the same in one place as another
[18:11:06] <olarf> i am just browsing the style.css out of the boilerplate
[18:11:20] <olarf> and i see lines like : legend { border: 0; *margin-left: -7px; padding: 0; }
[18:11:32] <eddiemonge> ....and?
[18:11:33] <olarf> i will never use a "legend" tag
[18:11:36] <eddiemonge> what chee said
[18:11:44] <eddiemonge> olarf: then delete that section
[18:11:49] <chee> olarf: best practices that have come about because a lot of smart people spent a lot of their time making the world easier for everybody else is not just 'what other people have declared in their css'
[18:11:58] <chee> it's a really good thing to have
[18:12:13] <chee> but that's just me
[18:12:28] <olarf> the legend tag is a good thing to have?
[18:12:39] <chee> are you being glib
[18:12:42] <eddiemonge> it is when you use it right, yes
[18:13:29] <olarf> but then why it is "*margin-left: -7px"
[18:13:34] <olarf> it looks random to me
[18:14:16] <olarf> but lets stop this i really do not want to say anything bad about the html5 boilerplate
[18:14:33] <olarf> i just thing i work another way ..
[18:14:41] <tw2113> i'm sure paul irish and the rest of them would love feedback
[18:14:51] <tw2113> and what's stopping you from changing it?
[18:15:09] <coldhead> determinism
[18:15:17] <tw2113> the whole point of it is to be a starting spot that you customize to your needs
[18:15:44] <olarf> i cannot change things which i dont know and dont use
[18:16:00] <olarf> i can just delete them
[18:16:11] <tw2113> deleting technically equals changing :P
[18:16:33] <tw2113> or equates to
[18:16:38] <eddiemonge> you know coldhead wrote all of html5boilerplate right?
[18:16:49] <olarf> dont you understand .. lets say i make a "button" - tag into my website
[18:16:58] <olarf> no i dont
[18:17:07] <olarf> but good to know ^^
[18:17:27] <olarf> further with the button
[18:17:54] <olarf> how can i know that its set to have the atribute "*vertical-align: middle"
[18:18:21] <tw2113> look at the resulting files? view it with firebug?
[18:18:35] <chee> olarf: it will probably say so in style.css
[18:18:36] <NoiseEee> why do you care, whats the purpose of knowing
[18:18:42] <chee> olarf: those things *aren't* random
[18:19:05] <chee> olarf: what you know is that what your button looks like in your browser is probably going to be what it looks like in other browsers
[18:19:13] <chee> without having to write all the magick yourself
[18:19:45] <chee> because all of the magick has been performed by the chaps who did normalize.css and the wonderful people behind html5 boilerplate
[18:19:54] <chee> your styles go after that
[18:20:11] <chee> with the confidence they will look the same in one place as another
[18:20:21] <eddiemonge> olarf: think of the h5bp css as the jquery of the css world
[18:20:23] <NoiseEee> welcome to web development
[18:20:44] <NoiseEee> load up about 6 browsers and have fun
[18:20:45] <someprimetime> is david banner in here?
[18:21:02] <olarf> i am trying to fight my way into the boilerplate :)
[18:21:07] <someprimetime> wrong room
[18:21:08] <chee> olarf: perhaps you can use something fancy like this instead of showing and hiding divs: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[18:21:25] <chee> someprimetime: if i see david banner i will tell him you are looking for him
[18:21:53] <someprimetime> ?david banner @ chee
[18:21:58] <bot-t> chee, #2226 (serious appendTo bug)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2226
[18:22:03] <someprimetime> bot-t doesn't know how to handle that
[18:25:02] <smplstk> chee, what's david banner's actual nick?
[18:25:35] <NoiseEee> hulkBro
[18:25:36] <olarf> chee: thanks .. looks like something i am looking for but its not the way "everyone" is doing it right now isnt it?
[18:25:48] <chee> olarf: who knows
[18:26:01] <olarf> do you?
[18:26:02] <chee> olarf: if it was would you be less likely to do it?
[18:26:19] <olarf> no i would love to use it then
[18:26:20] <eddiemonge> olarf: why do you have to fight everything?
[18:26:28] <chee> is this why you do not want to use 5h5bp. are you some kind of web developing hipster
[18:26:33] <chee> *h5bp
[18:26:39] <olarf> no not at all
[18:26:58] <chee> olarf: html5 boilerplate is a collection the ways everyone is doing everything
[18:27:08] <chee> that's why we were suggesting it
[18:27:21] <olarf> ok so it has to be ...
[18:27:45] <chee> it seems odd that best practices only appeal to you for how to reveal and obscure content
[18:27:49] <chee> you are an odd fish
[18:27:57] <olarf> should i use all the tags like "pre, code, kbd, samp" and so on in my html markup?
[18:28:04] <olarf> or is this just kind of additional stuff?
[18:28:21] <eddiemonge> if it fits use it
[18:28:24] <eddiemonge> if it doesnt dont
[18:28:34] <chee> ^
[18:28:54] <olarf> odd fish ... hehe
[18:29:22] <olarf> i think i made some statements here which let me look like an kind of idiot
[18:29:36] <olarf> but i am just exploring possibilities
[18:31:41] <chee> that's fair enough behaviour. why don't you watch some of the introductory videos for h5bp? that'll give you some insight
[18:31:56] <theBrettman> wow, have u guys seen jquerymx?
[18:32:05] <theBrettman> it pwns ui
[18:32:11] <chee> i myself watch divya's video every night before i sleep, after i put on my slippers but before i have my warm milk
[18:32:38] <theBrettman> u guys should checkout javascriptmvc.com
[18:32:59] <eddiemonge> why? and thats pretty old news
[18:34:39] <lsone> if i want to append a few divs with different data-roles, with a table nested in the middle of them to the end of <body>, what is the best route to go?
[18:34:59] <lsone> a long string that would be the actual html of it, doesn't seem to work when plugged into .append()
[18:35:52] <theBrettman> well it's better than anything I've seen
[18:35:53] <olarf> chee: ok you got me ... i will watch those vids now ..
[18:36:01] <eddiemonge> lsone: that works if you do it right
[18:36:15] <lsone> apparently i'm not doing it right. lol
[18:36:31] <lsone> ('body').append('long string of html')
[18:37:26] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ lsone
[18:37:26] <bot-t> lsone, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:37:37] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/gLU7T/4/
[18:37:46] <lsone> it works on that.
[18:38:08] <lsone> once it is tossed into a document.ready is when it doesn't work
[18:38:39] <lsone> i get 'Error Loading Page' as if it isn't producing that html at all
[18:39:40] <eddiemonge> lsone: then you should fix that error
[18:40:34] <lsone> most helpful comment all day :D i feel speshul.
[18:41:00] <eddiemonge> well "Error loading page" means there was an error loading that page. nothing usually to do with js
[18:41:10] <lsone> it has everything to do with the js.
[18:41:27] <lsone> the pageCreate function is dynamically appending the 'page' to the end
[18:41:45] <lsone> when i take it out of the function and just plug it into the html it works.
[18:42:42] <eddiemonge> lsone: where do you see that error message?
[18:45:43] <eddiemonge> lsone: oh its a jqm page. doc.ready() doesnt work for that
[18:48:53] <lsone> i did it with page create as well, no luck there eitehr
[18:48:55] <lsone> either*
[18:49:17] <lsone> i knew it was either an event or append issue, just no idea where to even start
[18:50:19] <eddiemonge> you should start where the error message tells you the problem is occurring
[18:50:45] <lsone> that is my appoint.
[18:51:00] <lsone> 'Error Loading Page' is pointing to the page that is supposed to be created.
[18:51:06] <lsone> The page is not being created.
[18:51:15] <eddiemonge> where are you seeing that error message?
[18:51:20] <eddiemonge> what is the console telling you?
[18:51:31] <lsone> That function is firing, I have tested that with alerts and logs, but the append is not happening.
[18:51:59] <lsone> The console is telling me that #page2 which is a data-role"page" is not there.
[18:52:14] <lsone> which, it is supposed to be created when pageCreate() runs.
[18:52:55] <lsone> pageCreate runs on doc ready, but something isn't working somewhere because the links are not reaching the new html, or the new html just isn't there.
[18:54:06] <zivester> whats the best event(s) to use to detect every change/keypress/paste of an input box? I want to do perform a function everytime the input box changes (not just on .change();
[18:55:05] <eddiemonge> lsone: what happens when you console.log page2 in the pageCreate?
[18:55:44] <eddiemonge> zivester: then you have to bind to all the events that can change it although watching if something was pasted in it isnt always accurate
[18:57:28] <zivester> ok outside of the pasting, does "keypress" cover everything?
[18:57:35] <mansoor> zivester, you have to use the key keypress
[18:57:56] <mansoor> but you have to make sure you have a "flag" that is enabled when the CTRL key is pressed
[18:58:06] <mansoor> and then when the V button is pressed
[18:58:07] <humper> hey everyone -- haev a quick question about replaceWith -- if the HTML being replaced in contains javascript, and that javascript throws an exception, is it possible to catch that exception in a way that allows the html to still be bolted in (understanding that a portion of the new HTML might not work)
[18:58:14] <mansoor> youdo your thing
[18:59:13] <eddiemonge> mansoor: what about right click pasting?
[18:59:27] <smplstk> humper, how bout don't have inline js?
[18:59:38] <smplstk> problem solved!
[18:59:39] <humper> :) sounds lovely, but not an option
[19:00:10] <smplstk> inline js makes angels cry
[19:00:31] <humper> if I concede that point, can you help me make my thing work??
[19:00:32] <humper> :)
[19:00:37] <mansoor> eddiemonge, i dont' know honestly
[19:00:58] <eddiemonge> mansoor: exactly. there is no case that covers all input types for all browsers/devices
[19:01:37] <lsone> hmmm
[19:01:51] <lsone> it looks as though it is trying to load www/page2
[19:02:03] <lsone> not sure if that is what it is supposed to do, but i don't think so
[19:04:51] <glupo> may i ask for a little help with empty() ?
[19:05:49] <mansoor> glupo, no
[19:05:56] <glupo> i need to cut off sth like <div class="well" id=some_int>...</div>
[19:06:44] <mansoor> glupo, so remove the sth  div  being returned from a sslector?
[19:08:18] <glupo> i didn't understood =(
[19:08:37] <chee> eddiemonge: how does google instant do it
[19:08:43] <eddiemonge> do what?
[19:08:44] <glupo> i just watched on jquery.com for a method empty()
[19:08:51] <chee> oh yes
[19:08:58] <glupo> but cant really figure out how to realize this
[19:09:00] <eddiemonge> ?remove @ glupo
[19:09:01] <bot-t> glupo, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[19:09:05] <chee> eddiemonge: it reacts to right click pasting
[19:09:26] <chee> oh there is a paste event
[19:09:53] <eddiemonge> paste event doesnt work everywhere
[19:10:52] <chee> so it listens on all keypresses and mouseup and mousedown and paste and that covers most but not all cases
[19:11:15] <chee> is that about the height of it
[19:11:46] <eddiemonge> chee: it might also do polling
[19:14:54] <eddiemonge> plus i dont think google instant works everywhere. .... does it?
[19:16:39] <chee> no probably not
[19:21:29] <lsone> ok, new development on my problem. the html is 'there' it just isn't being seen when the link is clicked on?
[19:22:44] <lsone> the new page div IS there, it just isn't loading.
[19:23:28] <lsone> yet if i pull it out, put it directly into the html, it still looks exactly the same when i load it up, except it DOES load.
[19:23:31] <lsone> weird.
[19:24:10] <eddiemonge> lsone: you should ask in #jquerymobile since its a jqm problem
[19:24:28] <abjorn> :o
[19:24:31] <lsone> ah! didn't realize they had a channel also :D tried phone gap with no luck
[19:24:43] <chee> :o
[19:28:15] <eddiemonge> the best time to ask for jqm help though is during the day
[19:33:10] <bulate> testing
[19:34:54] <eddiemonge> system error: total failure
[20:02:19] <coldhead> you're an electronic girl and i'm a rock guy, i don't think we have a chance
[20:04:53] <Bearcat> folks, i need some basic best-practice help on loading jquery and jqueryui for a website that i'm building for someone else. I've been reading that using the google CDN is the best way. However, then i have to get a key for each site. Is that not as much of a pain as it sounds like? What if i don't know what the final url of the site is going to be?
[20:06:33] <Bearcat> if i just use <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-min.js"></script> then the cache expires very quickly yes?
[20:16:59] <eddiemonge> Bearcat: you dont need a key to use google api
[20:17:26] <eddiemonge> if you dont specify a version number the cache is 1 hour. the more specific version you have the longer the cache
[20:18:55] <tash> is there some reason why $("#id").html(data); works in firefox, but in IE it seems to hate me?
[20:21:50] <eddiemonge> tash: what is data? whats the error?
[20:22:41] <Bearcat> eddiemonge: ahh thank you. You only need the key for google specific apis? (google maps, google search ect?)
[20:23:05] <Symbolic> tash: post example on jsfiddle.net
[20:23:56] <eddiemonge> Bearcat: right. https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L53
[20:28:54] <tash> eddiemonger: data is a table
[20:29:26] <tash> there's too much crap code to put on jsfiddle.  I got handed this old stale crappy project ...
[20:30:14] <eddiemonge> tash: but what is data? a string, dom object, jquery object?
[20:32:34] <tash> eddiemonger: it's literally a table <table> with some <tr>'s, <td>'s ... I'm trying to connect to a div whose id is "invitems" and .html the data there.
[20:33:16] <tash> I'm going .get() to pass data to the server, and returning the html/table ... so when I alert(data) all you see is the table elements etc
[20:33:53] <diegoviola> any slideshow plugin you would recommend?
[20:44:20] <Shai-Tan> How can I have jquery ui tabs, forward to an external url?
[20:46:20] <chuck_tes> im trying to change the section titles in this website (Introduction, Our Company, Products, ect) but I can't figure out how to do it?
[20:46:20] <chuck_tes> http://www.flashmo.com/preview/flashmo_244_diamond_cafe
[20:48:07] <chuck_tes> can someone please help?
[20:52:04] <Symbolic> Chuck: look like those titles are in flash?
[20:52:10] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ tash
[20:52:10] <bot-t> tash, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:52:19] <eddiemonge> use a simplified demo
[20:52:58] <eddiemonge> chuck_tes: thats flash not jquery
[20:53:18] <chuck_tes> i know i can't change it form the css. i checked the html and i can't change them from in there. there are xml files associated with each section but im not sure if that is where to change the section titles. there is also included a flash fi.......
[20:53:31] <chuck_tes> yeha i know. i figured someone in here would knwo though.
[20:53:46] <chuck_tes> i can't find a room dedicated to flash. been looking on google.
[20:56:00] <kanja> Is there a way I can execute a focus/blur event for an element and all it's children?
[20:56:13] <kanja> so if focus passed from one child to the next, nothing would happen
[20:56:47] <eddiemonge> kanja: whats happening now?
[20:57:19] <kanja> I don't know how to phrase it
[20:57:51] <kanja> I can focus on say a div with a tabindex, but then if focus passes to one of it's children the blur event is fired
[20:58:19] <kanja> can I prevent that blur from firing until focus moves to something that's not the div or any of it's kids?
[21:09:17] <kd`> hellp
[21:09:25] <kd`> s/p/o/
[21:10:20] <kd`> what would people recommend as an unobtrusive jquery date picker.  Assume that all I can do with the html is to set the class="something" attr on the input type="text"
[21:10:45] <kd`> but other than that I have complete control over the css and javascript
[21:12:12] <kd`> bonus points for works on legacy platforms (i.e. IE)
[21:13:54] <codepython777> can anyone help me with this script please: http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/dynamic_javascript.html -- I would like to put the carousel centered on the rendering screen with percentages in height and width
[21:14:09] <codepython777> Cant figure out how to change the height/width/placement of the jcarousel
[21:14:31] <codepython777> or is it hardcoded?
[21:17:01] <kd`> doesn't look hard coded from the source of the demo page
[21:17:20] <kd`> this.wh=!this.options.vertical?"width":"height";
[21:17:35] <kd`> but I'd like to look at the uncompressed source to make a firmer prediction :)
[21:19:57] <codepython777> kd`: so if i want the carousel to have width = 70% of the page and height = height of the images inside, what would i do?
[21:20:23] <chuck_tes> can someone help me?
[21:20:37] <kd`> codepython777: not sure, but it seems that it's not hard coded
[21:21:13] <kd`> but more reading of the source is required.  If you need something in % and it expects pixels I guess you have to do some calculations to get pixels from %
[21:30:23] <codepython777> kd`: what part of the code should i look at?
[21:31:42] <bob_cobb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9059640/custom-jquery-plugin-only-targeting-specific-container if anyone gets a sec to check this out let me know what you think
[21:48:53] <pifantastic> bob_cobb: you aren't using 'var' for $thisContainer and $contentContainer
[21:48:55] <pifantastic> so those are global
[21:49:04] <pifantastic> that's going to be problematic
[21:53:12] <chee> i wish i had had some warning that that page was going to start playing jazz when i opened it. people are in bed and i very nearly underwent cardiac arrest
[21:53:41] <chee> oh and he's gone anyway so it was pointless
[21:54:09] <destryalhmns> anyone have any idea why unicode characters get pwnd when you put them in a jquery-ui button?
[21:54:42] <chee> destryalhmns: is your charset set to utf-8?
[21:54:49] <destryalhmns> ahh
[21:54:54] <destryalhmns> let me try
[21:56:17] <chee> ok i will let you but just this once
[21:58:24] <destryalhmns> like this <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">?
[21:59:14] <chee> party like it's 1999
[21:59:37] <chee> i mean yes
[21:59:43] <destryalhmns> doesnt work
[21:59:56] <chee> doesn't work
[22:00:00] <chee> ?demo @ destryalhmns
[22:00:00] <bot-t> destryalhmns, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:00:16] <destryalhmns> it works outside the button but the exact second you call.button() it stops working
[22:00:42] <b1lly> is there a way to break a string into an array based on a character?
[22:01:38] <chee> b1lly: .split
[22:02:06] <chee> "i like dogs".split(' ') => ["i", "like", "dogs"]
[22:03:05] <tw2113> ooh, sort of like php's explode
[22:03:19] <chee> php explodes dogs
[22:03:41] <tw2113> the nerve!
[22:04:00] <b1lly> thanks
[22:05:56] <destryalhmns> its not working http://jsfiddle.net/Aa9xY/1/
[22:05:56] <chee> yw ^^
[22:06:19] <destryalhmns> but when it does work locally, once you call .button the unicode turns into a square
[22:06:40] <chee> destryalhmns: have you checked that that isn't a documented feature
[22:06:42] <destryalhmns> actually the play button works
[22:07:08] * destryalhmns shrugs, looks stupid, blinks
[22:09:03] <b1lly> is there a string containers function
[22:10:56] <chee> containers, b1lly ?
[22:11:28] <chee> if you meant contains then
[22:11:43] <chee> "dogs on film".indexOf('on') => 5
[22:11:49] <chee> "dogs on film".indexOf('girls') => -1
[22:11:53] <chee> so:
[22:13:27] <chee> if ( she.indexOf('herpes') > -1 ) { /* do nothing */ }
[22:13:41] <chee> if ( she.indexOf('herpes') ) > -1 ) { /* do nothing */ }
[22:13:43] <tw2113> and i thought i had fun
[22:13:45] <chee> was missing a parens
[22:13:53] <chee> *paren
[22:14:14] <b1lly> indexof -1 means it wasnt found
[22:14:24] <chee> yes
[22:14:36] <tw2113> need to involve paris hilton somehow
[22:14:40] <tw2113> or obama
[22:15:15] <chee> if ( club.indexOf('paris hilton') > -1 ) { /* find another club */ }
[22:15:21] <chee> i wasn't missing a paren at all
[22:15:23] <chee> i was just tired
[22:15:32] <destryalhmns> screw it, will just use <>
[22:15:45] <seraphim> could anyone help me with my script? :( http://jsfiddle.net/fSdUA/ is what i have so far but it doesnt seem to be posting to my file
[22:16:06] <seraphim> if i take away the .val() itll show the vars ready to post but will give me an error:[object Object]
[22:18:03] <seraphim> any help is appreciated :)
[22:19:51] <chee> destryalhmns: you could try using the html entities instead and se gos for you
[22:20:09] <chee> destryalhmns: &#8634; instead of ↺
[22:25:28] <seraphim> anyone? XD
[22:34:11] <chee> seraphim: instead of
[22:34:42] <chee> site: ("<?php echo $i_am_a_little_teapot ?>").val(),
[22:34:51] <chee> i would imagine you might like to try
[22:34:57] <chee> site: "<?php echo $i_am_a_little_teapot ?>",
[22:35:24] <seraphim> alright ill giver a try
[22:36:34] <seraphim> I got Error:[object Object] ;(
[22:36:41] <chee> perhaps you could ask the crack team of nerds
[22:36:51] <seraphim> I wish Xd
[22:36:58] <seraphim> that crack teams of nerds is me XD
[22:37:03] <seraphim> team*
[22:37:04] <chee> did you remove the parentheses
[22:37:08] <seraphim> yeah i did
[22:37:32] <seraphim> http://jsfiddle.net/fSdUA/1/ changed it
[22:38:04] <chee> you realise you have pasted that al into the javascript box
[22:38:13] <seraphim> yeah
[22:38:20] <seraphim> because the script won't work standalone either way
[22:38:25] <chee> i don't mean to be pernickety
[22:38:49] <seraphim> its somewhere to paste the code XD
[22:38:59] <chee> mm
[22:39:01] <chee> yes it is
[22:41:01] <seraphim> i guess i can just describe what im trying to do.. basically make it so they have to stay on the page until they entered in the captcha for voting..
[22:41:11] <seraphim> if they leave the page nothing will get posted
[22:43:57] <seraphim> I'm guessing its a mystery as to how to fix this though XD
[22:44:32] <chee> what line is the error on
[22:44:57] <seraphim> i cant find it thats the problem o.o its just going to the error reporting i have in the code
[22:45:11] <seraphim> and there are nothing in the logs on my server..
[22:45:18] <seraphim> there is nothing*
[22:47:13] <seraphim> and i cant find out what the object Object error is
[22:47:31] <chee> it's exactly what it sounds like
[22:47:35] <bob_cobb> pif: ar eyou the same as pifantastic?
[22:47:43] <bob_cobb> are, rather
[22:49:11] <seraphim> hmm

[23:23:02] <joshualibrarian> Okay, I am so close, and have put the whole nifty widget with a test case into this fiddle...
[23:23:02] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/p46vL/20/
[23:23:14] <joshualibrarian> why does it loose the currentSlide object at the completion of the animation.
[23:23:16] <joshualibrarian> ?
[23:23:52] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ joshualibrarian
[23:23:53] <bot-t> joshualibrarian, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[23:25:34] <joshualibrarian> sheesh I'm trying!  It's not conducive to splitting that chunk.  The problem seems like it's something to do with how I'm tossing objects around in the animation.
[23:30:24] <chee> sheesh
[23:35:51] <is_null> hi all, when the user clicks on an element (A) it shows another element (B). Question: how to detect that the user clicks outside element (B) to hide it ?
[23:36:28] <is_null> (like in gmail search, click to show advanced options, then click elsewhere in the page: it closes advanced options)
[23:37:55] <joshualibrarian> aha... somehow I am loosing the scope of "self" once I go into the animation callback function!
[23:37:59] <joshualibrarian> how can I pass it in and keep hold of it?
[23:39:45] <rookie84> is there a simulation software or something I can check jquery mobile code with?
[23:41:03] <bage> Is there any way to integrate pretty photo with zurb orbit slider?
[23:47:39] <progrock`> man jsut foudn out about vi mode in zsh, I am happier than I should be
[23:47:46] <progrock`> now all I need is vi mod in irssi
[23:51:42] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/rfql1qx5kxfqmx7plxle5w - I have this, when I click the submit button, I would like to remove the values of two fields, how is that possible?
[23:52:12] <progrock`> wow
[23:52:19] <progrock`> you know you can use whitespace in your code...
[23:53:06] <progrock`> man, shits too messy for me to acually edit the code
[23:53:18] <beasty> mornings
[23:53:29] <progrock`> I se your makign an ajaz request on submit, do you need the results to knw what inputs to erase?
[23:53:33] <beasty> is there a way to decode htmlspecialchars in javascript ?
[23:55:48] <nisseni> progrock`: you talking to me or?
[23:56:43] <progrock`> yea
[23:57:27] <nisseni> progrock`: yeah, but those inputs have an id, so that shouldnt be too difficult
[23:57:56] <progrock`> k, so you ned to have the response?
