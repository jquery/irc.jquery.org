[00:25:10] <relipse> what is a decent drop down menu, i tried jquery ui menu() but it did not suffice
[00:39:24] <vockav> i am using multi select...and on click of clear button i want to remove the selected values..it works fine..but if i have any preselected values it does not work
[00:42:40] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/ytWyUTDc this only works in chrome
[00:42:42] <Rinthe> not ff or ie
[00:42:44] <Rinthe> any ideas?
[00:44:11] <tankblergh> Hi guys! I have a DIV containing a DIV of a larger size than itself. When I do a .height() of the outer DIV it returns the size of the larger inner DIV. How can I get the size of the outer div?
[00:47:09] <xec_> Rinthe: hi again :) it's a bad idea to have selectors inside the scroll event handler (save them in a var outside and use those) - i also thought the scroll event was fired on window (not document, but i could be wrong) - and is there any reason you're omitting the {} brackets of the if and else?
[00:48:49] <fabioportieri> tankblergh: the outer div adapt to its inner, so you are already getting the size of the outer div
[00:49:01] <sacho_> tankblergh, http://jsfiddle.net/BGSacho/UNuHC/
[00:49:03] <sacho_> test case, please.
[00:49:29] <Rinthe> xec_ they're just 1 line so i dont need {} right?
[00:50:29] <xec_> Rinthe: true, but same logic goes for the semicolons (not needed, but best practice is to use them to avoid edge case bugs)
[00:51:10] <Rinthe> xec_ okay i'll add them
[00:51:29] <Rinthe> let me work on the seelctor thing too
[00:53:00] <Rinthe> xec_: do you know why it wouldn't load all of my images on tumblr? it always stops after certain post, i know there are way more posts
[00:53:18] <xec_> sorry, not familiar with tumblr
[00:54:13] <shoky> Rinthe: you don't want to call .slideUp or .slideDown on EVERY scroll event..
[00:54:47] <xec_> thats true too
[00:54:53] <Rinthe> xec_ its not the platform, its just my code haha ;p
[00:54:59] <Rinthe> shoky: oh hmmm
[00:55:01] <xec_> and scrollTop() on body doesnt work in chrome
[00:55:06] <xec_> err firefox
[00:55:11] <Rinthe> shoky: how do i only call that once?
[00:55:24] <Rinthe> it doesnt work in IE FF
[00:55:35] <Rinthe> where do i scroll then?
[00:55:37] <Rinthe> document?
[00:59:04] <xec_> hmm
[00:59:14] <xec_> does jsfiddle have issues with ie10?
[00:59:27] <xec_> i tried this http://jsfiddle.net/kkgD7/1/ but IE says $ is undefined :P
[00:59:36] <xec_> fine in chrome and ff :P
[01:00:31] <xec_> oh shit, 2.x doesnt work in IE at all? i was under the impression they only left *old* ie behind
[01:00:45] <ravenzz> it should be like that I guess
[01:01:09] <ravenzz> no support for IE7/8
[01:01:23] <xec_> but IE 10 ...
[01:01:28] <Rinthe> xec: the button #up doesnt show in both IE and FF
[01:01:30] <Rinthe> only in chrome
[01:01:49] <xec_> Rinthe: i'm discussing that link i gave
[01:02:01] <Rinthe> xec_ oh ops
[01:02:38] <xec_> which works in ff and chrome, but not IE10 - except if i change to jquery 1.9.1 (1.x edge doesnt work either)
[01:03:55] <xec_> Rinthe: what jq version are you using?
[01:04:06] <Rinthe> xec_ latest
[01:04:10] <xec_> as in
[01:04:24] <Rinthe> 2.0.0
[01:04:32] <Rinthe> i guess thats teh latest
[01:04:38] <xec_> you don't know?
[01:04:49] <Rinthe> well i checked not toooo long ago
[01:04:50] <Rinthe> :p
[01:04:54] <ravenzz> edget now is 2.0.3-pre
[01:05:11] <xec_> latest is 1.10.1 and 2.0.2 i believe
[01:05:23] <Rinthe> why is there 2 different versions?
[01:05:32] <sacho> xec_, it's working just fine for ie10.
[01:05:33] <xec_> one that supports old IE
[01:05:42] <xec_> sacho: the link i gave?
[01:05:44] <Rinthe> which is that?
[01:05:49] <sacho> yes.
[01:06:05] <sacho> Oh, sorry, it doesn't.
[01:06:12] <xec_> that is weird, doesn't on my machine
[01:06:46] <Rinthe> ok the button shows up now
[01:06:56] <Rinthe> but how can i not call slideup everytime i scroll?
[01:07:22] <ravenzz> xec_ did you get this error too? SCRIPT5: Access is denied. jquery-2.0.2.js, line 1378 character 2
[01:07:22] <xec_> Rinthe: you could add a class to the element when it is open, and check if it's already opened
[01:07:48] <sacho> xec_, this shouldn't be a problem
[01:07:58] <relipse>  any idea how i can get google tabs like these: http://goo.gl/cKlvz
[01:08:10] <xec_> ravenzz: almost, SCRIPT5: Access is denied. jquery-git2.js, line 1341 character 2
[01:08:26] <xec_> sacho: yeah i'm thinking it's a jsfiddle issue, not a jq one
[01:08:35] <ravenzz> xec_ well yeah.. that's jQuery 2.x (edge)
[01:09:19] <Rinthe> xec_: Oh i could just search itself! is visible
[01:09:28] <Rinthe> xec_ I keep typing sex as your name
[01:09:38] <xec_> sex is my *middle* name
[01:10:33] <Rinthe> lol
[01:10:41] <xec_> Rinthe: i think, performance-wise, .hasClass('open') is faster than .is(':visible')
[01:11:14] <sacho> xec_, well actually, that code is supposed to avoid the problem that is happening in the first place, so I'm not so sure
[01:12:24] <Rinthe> xec_: so i haev to add another condition to remove the class?
[01:12:45] <Rinthe> wait no
[01:12:52] <sacho> that's probably a bug.
[01:13:04] <xec_> Rinthe: no, you can remove in the same condition as you hide it. the new condition is to check if it's already open
[01:13:12] <Rinthe> right:p
[01:14:00] <MindSpark> hello guys, I am looking for a plugin like this one http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/ but I 'd rather want to use it for tagging. This means that multiple areas should be selectable and resizable as well. Most image tagging plugins don't allow resizing and this plugin doesn't look like it actually supports multiple tagging. Any suggestions?
[01:15:58] <Rinthe> xec_ mind if i pm u a link?
[01:16:07] <xec_> no
[01:21:16] <Abhijit> hi. i have var data = '{"events":[{"id":"evt1","eventtype":"Voltage Fluctuation","name":"Voltage Event 1 and so on and then i am doing data = $.parseJSON(data); then how can i access name property of the object "events"? can i do data.events.id.name
[01:22:05] <Cork> Abhijit: yes
[01:22:29] <Cork> Abhijit: and just set the ajax to json and jquery should do the parsing for you
[01:22:54] <Cork> the server needs to say that it sends json basically
[01:23:11] <vockav> hi! how do u remove preselected values in jquery?
[01:24:14] <Abhijit> ok
[01:26:08] <sacho> "remove preselected values"?
[01:27:42] <vockav> yes i have a select box...and im using chosen for multi select. Basically, i have some values which are selected on page load. When i click the clear button, i want the selected values to be removed.
[01:28:59] <sacho> xec_, funnily, if you bypass that bypass, jquery will boot fine and work
[01:29:28] <sacho> (place a breakpoint on line 1341, set parent to undefined when you hit it, and run - you'll get your scroll script running)
[01:29:30] <jkarsrud> I can't seem to remember, but jquery.fn.remove fail silently if it doesn't match the given selector, and continues down the chain, right?
[01:29:58] <Abhijit> Cork, alert(data.events.divid.name); is not working where divid is resurt of other calculation which result in one of the id of the "events" array
[01:30:02] <sacho> jkarsrud, huh?
[01:30:19] <sacho> remove() removes each element in the collection - if the collection is empty, it's not a "failure" condition
[01:30:27] <jkarsrud> no, that's what I mean
[01:31:07] <jkarsrud> basically $('somecollection').remove('.selector').append('<div class="selector" />')
[01:32:40] <jkarsrud> but yes, I just answered my own question, so it's all good
[01:32:45] <sacho> okay.
[01:35:48] <vockav> sacho: any idea?
[01:37:34] <sacho> I'm not sure what the question is
[01:41:19] <vockav> i have a multi select. On page load, a few values are selected. When I click the clear button, all the selected values should be removed(no values should be selected).
[01:42:41] <Rinthe> http://erichu.tumblr.com/ if you keep scrolling down, it'll stop loading posts (I have wayy more) at some point and when you go back up, a bunch of posts are stacked up together. can anyone find the problem? there are no errors or anything
[01:42:47] <mpavel> hey, does anyone know of a script for implementing a gallery where the pictures change when you hover the mouse from left to right (and in reverse from left to right) ?
[01:44:49] <sunbeam> what do you guys think is the best framework, 960gs, bootstrap, foundation or any other?
[01:45:19] <sacho> vockav, just use val("")
[01:45:41] <mogaj> How do give alternate close button for jquery dialog box?
[01:48:00] <anli> Will $('#parent').stop(true, true); propagate to children?
[01:49:31] <sacho> no
[01:49:50] <anli> So I have to use $('#parent *").stop(true, true); then?
[01:49:52] <sacho> jquery's animation functions work only on the queue of the selected element
[01:50:06] <sacho> possibly
[01:50:14] <vockav> sacho: its not working..the value from view side gets removed, but when i inspect, it still shows selected values
[01:50:22] <anli> It doesnt matter if I stop an element thats not animated then?
[01:50:36] <sacho> no
[01:50:47] <sacho> although you should consider having a list of the animations you need to stop
[01:50:52] <sacho> instead of selecting *all* elements..
[01:50:57] <anli> Thats error prone
[01:51:02] <anli> Another error source
[01:51:27] <anli> prune
[01:51:38] <sacho> vockav, test case please.
[01:51:47] <sacho> anli, it's error prone how?
[01:52:03] <anli> That I have another set of variables in the code
[01:52:21] <anli> Instead of having a guarantee that nothing is animated
[01:52:33] <sacho> are you afraid of variables or something?
[01:52:34] <mogaj> How do i give an alternate close button for jquery dialog box?
[01:52:39] <Rinthe> anyone?
[01:53:11] <anli> No, I am not afraid of something, but my code style builds upon not adding error sources
[01:53:35] <anli> div.find('*').stop(true, false); is a no discussion way of coding, there will be no animations
[01:56:04] <anli> But I would never seek for * other than in a limited set of elements
[01:57:57] <vockav> sacho, i found the soln. used selected as false. and called .trigger('liszt:updated');
[01:57:58] <vockav> thanks
[01:58:08] <sacho> ...ok
[02:03:33] <Rinthe> is ti better to pack all the js plugin's into 1 file?
[02:03:52] <Rinthe> like masonry waypoint infinite scroll etc.
[02:07:50] <seutje> Having a weird issue with canvg where hovering the generated canvas element cause it to endlessly create new canvas elements with a certain shape
[02:16:52] <Cork> Rinthe: yes, have a server script manage the script
[02:16:53] <Cork> +s
[02:17:13] <Cork> Rinthe: one of the bigger overheads for js is actually the separate http requests
[02:17:57] <Rinthe> cork: okay
[02:21:30] <seutje> fixed the canvg issue: don't use height 100% on patterns
[02:29:52] <Elrinth> jquery ui drag with helper function and appendTo doesn't seem to work
[02:32:14] <Cork> ?p @ Elrinth
[02:32:25] <Cork> aaand the bot is down again
[02:32:41] <Cork> Elrinth: put the code in jsfiddle and post a link
[02:37:09] <ktwo> hi, i have a annoying problem, i am using primefaces which itself uses JQuery. Now i got a component which triggers an ajax() call. I cannot change the parameters of this, but only the "HTML" part. Now i need to call a JS function after the ajax is done. Any idea how to do it?
[02:37:26] <ktwo> because if i call it in an inline script tag - it is too early
[02:37:33] <ktwo> because the browser hasnt rendered some items yet
[02:38:03] <Cork> ktwo: use the callbacks
[02:38:24] <ktwo> Can i use them inline ? (beacuse i dont want to rewrite primefaces components)
[02:38:29] <Cork> $.ajax().done() or the success: function() {} in the option object
[02:40:20] <ktwo> The function to be called is being defined in the payload of that ajax request , can i use this ajax().done() there too?
[02:40:56] <Cork> payload?
[02:41:06] <Cork> you mean the data: {} section?
[02:41:10] <Cork> then no
[02:41:24] <ktwo> i mean, the response (when server finished, i get back the stuff which is to be updated)
[02:41:33] <Cork> the options can $.ajax({ data: {}, success: function() {} }
[02:41:42] <Cork> ktwo: not really
[02:41:59] <Cork> if you send html you can include a script tag and that will somewhat work
[02:42:18] <Cork> but other then that; no
[02:42:22] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/UtT77MBN is my syntax correct?
[02:42:30] <ktwo> yea exactly thats what im doing now, the function is called - but unfortunately too early
[02:42:34] <Rinthe> unexpected } somehwer.e..
[02:42:55] <ktwo> maybe ill just try to add a timeout
[02:43:23] <Cork> Rinthe: you have one }); to many
[02:43:41] <Rinthe> at the end?
[02:43:45] <Cork> align the blocks and it should be easier to see
[02:44:08] <Cork> Rinthe: http://jsfiddle.net/P7HmE/
[02:44:35] <Cork> also you're mixing quotes left and right, you prob want to fix that
[02:44:40] <Cork> pick one and stick with it
[02:45:25] <Rinthe> oh yah
[02:45:28] <Rinthe> i copied some codes
[02:45:38] <Rinthe> any ideas why my images are not stacking correctly? http://erichu.tumblr.com
[02:47:15] <Cork> sigh
[02:47:29] <Cork> man i hate the tumbler; why does it need javascript to show a freeking image >_<
[02:47:39] <Rinthe> does it?
[02:47:42] <Cork> ya
[02:47:58] <Cork> it's like the jquery forums
[02:47:59] <Rinthe> thats on their side right
[02:48:40] <Cork> haven't digged that much into it no
[02:48:54] <Cork> Rinthe: what do you mean stacking?
[02:49:05] <Rinthe> cork: scroll down
[02:49:13] <Rinthe> the new posts are stacked
[02:49:22] <Rinthe> with the old ones ont he top
[02:49:37] <Cork> scroll down?
[02:49:41] <Cork> there is no scrolls
[02:50:06] <motaka2> cork i have function a() in file a.js and function b() which uses function a $("#content-in").on("click", 'a', function(e) { a();} in file b.js and I fist <scrpt src="a.js" .../> and then <script b.js > but console says a() is undefined, what should I do ?
[02:50:24] <Rinthe> cork: lol make the browser smaller :p
[02:50:54] <Cork> motaka2: sounds like your calling functions out of scope
[02:51:18] <motaka2> Cork: Yes, but what should I do, How can I make a() gloval
[02:51:19] <motaka2> ?
[02:51:24] <motaka2> global*
[02:51:25] <Cork> Rinthe: uh... fails...
[02:51:37] <Cork> motaka2: window.a = function();
[02:51:49] <Rinthe> cork: i know...
[02:52:02] <motaka2> Cork: a file is a scope ?
[02:52:11] <Cork> motaka2: no
[02:52:27] <motaka2> so why function a() doesnt make a global ?
[02:52:39] <Cork> motaka2: can't tell without seeing the code
[02:52:48] <motaka2> wait ...
[02:53:25] <Cork> Rinthe: your stacking them through float
[02:53:32] <Cork> Rinthe: and that is a limitation to float
[02:53:47] <Cork> the wrapped float will align with the longest element on the previous line
[02:54:20] <Rinthe> cork, nah i found why
[02:54:29] <Rinthe> cork, a wrong selector in the js :(
[02:54:33] <Rinthe> refresh now
[02:56:57] <motaka2> Cork: here you go:  http://jsfiddle.net/QvPEg/    in the second file I call requestUrl() but console says it is undefined
[02:59:22] <Cork> motaka2: a text search doen't find the two requestUrl instances
[02:59:29] <Cork> can't see why though...
[03:01:30] <Cork> motaka2: so ya, it looks like you've got some unprintable characters in there
[03:01:45] <motaka2> Cork: Idk
[03:02:19] <motaka2> Cork: You were right a typo , thank you
[03:02:34] <motaka2> Cork: You always help people with js ?
[03:02:44] <Cork> heh not only
[03:02:48] <Cork> :D
[03:03:03] <Cork> and ya, i sit here and code day on end anyway
[03:03:34] <motaka2> Cork: You do always great, you're a nice person. Thank you
[03:03:43] <Cork> thx
[03:03:49] * xec_ makes a cake for Cork
[03:04:00] <motaka2> :0
[03:04:02] <motaka2> :)
[03:04:41] <xec_> i hope you're not allergic to awesome, because it's an awesome cake
[03:05:04] <Cork> LOL
[03:22:50] <Rinthe> is it possible to see where #infscr-loading actualyl is? http://erichu.tumblr.com/
[03:29:02] <krad> hi.  i have a jquery element, how to select all its children of type button
[03:29:11] <krad> element.children("button") doesn't work
[03:29:40] <krad> element.children("#element_id button") works but the element doesn't have an id in my example
[03:30:22] <sacho> what's "type button"?
[03:30:38] <krad> <button ...
[03:30:38] <sacho> 'button' will select all button elements.
[03:30:53] <sacho> perhaps you don't want children() but rather find().
[03:30:58] <krad> oh ok
[03:31:04] <sacho> children is direct descendants.
[03:31:17] <krad> yup. that works
[03:31:51] <krad> thanks
[03:33:08] <zulu-gula> can I use find but in parent elemenets? for example: http://jsfiddle.net/Qwjxw/
[03:34:02] <Cork> $().closest('.parent').find()
[03:34:35] <Cork> or if you just want the parent see ?.closest
[03:34:36] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:34:39] <IainKay> hey can I ask a question about a bit of jquery code im using… at the moment I've got this adding a class to a list item but I really want to add the class to a href below the list item but cant seem to modify it and get it working
[03:35:23] <Cork> ?p @ IainKay
[03:35:24] <bot-t> IainKay, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:35:42] <Rinthe> is it possible to move where the infinite scroll loading thing shows up?
[03:36:41] <IainKay> http://fixee.org/paste/o5qlvsg/ - so essentially I have a html element, a href link, that when clicked fires this function
[03:36:45] <Trudko> Guys I have simple table http://jsbin.com/asaboq/2/edit and  I want to delete  rows. Lets say 1 st 3rd and4th . What is selectior for that?
[03:38:34] <mazoqui> it seems that google CDN is not serving jquery themes after 1.10.1 - anybody can confirm that?
[03:39:47] <mazoqui> working version: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[03:40:04] <mazoqui> 1.10.2 and 1.10.3 are not served.
[03:43:21] <Cork> mazoqui: loads fine here http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.min.js
[03:53:04] <mazoqui> Cork the js file loads, but not the related css theme
[03:53:20] <Cork> ah
[03:53:28] <Cork> so use the 1.10.1 one
[03:54:23] <Cork> mazoqui: or use http://code.jquery.com/
[03:54:26] <mazoqui> yes, but I believe ui js and css are related therefore most of applications build the href based on same version.
[03:54:45] <lemonsparrow> how to make select list point to "saab" ? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/yALT5/1/
[03:55:30] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/yALT5/2/
[03:55:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks :)
[03:57:12] <Nephro> Is it possible to query for elements by class name using some sort of wildcards? E.g. I have elements of classes "buttonA" and "buttonB", can I query for "button*" or smth?
[03:57:57] <Cork> no
[03:58:08] <Cork> just add an additional class
[03:58:30] <Cork> or well you can but then you lose all the points of using a class
[03:58:41] <Cork> (it becomes an attribute selector)
[04:01:22] <IainKay> quick question, .attr('id', 'new_id') is there anything special required to make that work?
[04:01:29] <^^jfc^^> hello there, I have this code to work as an accordion and it does. It expands the first element, and then, when clicking on a new one, it collapses the remaining expanded.... The problem is that for any reason, sometimes when I just access to the website, it doesnt load the javascript and I need to refresh. http://pastebin.com/rShN4XxT
[04:01:40] <mazoqui> thank you Cork - the http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css loads fine
[04:01:52] <Cork> IainKay: depends on how many elements you try to do it on
[04:02:02] <IainKay> $("ul tagcloud li:nth-child(14)").attr("id", "more_categories");
[04:02:09] <IainKay> i would have thought that would only operate on the 14th LI element
[04:02:31] <Rinthe> how come when i put all the files like infinitescroll, masonry, waypoints etc into the same file, things gets messed up?
[04:02:41] <Cork> IainKay: try $("ul tagcloud li").eq(13).attr("id", "more_categories");
[04:03:09] <Cork> Rinthe: missing semicolon most likely
[04:03:25] <^^jfc^^> maybe with jQuery(document).ready(function($) { I can fix it? http://pastebin.com/84Sa8vkw
[04:03:46] <Rinthe> cork: but i didnt touch a thing
[04:03:49] <Rinthe> just copy paste
[04:03:57] <Rinthe> i was careful too haha
[04:04:04] <mazoqui> strange 'smoothness' release 10.0.1, 10.0.2 and  10.0.3 are ok. but 'base' only works on 1.10.1
[04:04:23] <Cork> Rinthe: what does the browser console say?
[04:05:08] <Rinthe> i ddint get a chance to check
[04:05:10] <Rinthe> ill do it again soon
[04:05:29] <IainKay> @cork: still doesnt seem to apply :(
[04:06:08] <Cork> IainKay: wait a min... you have an element tagcloud in the page?
[04:06:19] <Cork> or did you mean ul.tagcloud ?
[04:06:58] <IainKay> doh
[04:07:00] <IainKay> i missed a dot
[04:07:09] <IainKay> thank you :p
[04:07:13] <Cork> :D
[04:09:00] <pikapika> Hey, can someone tell me how can I achieve a dynamic input option from the user which does not require me to go to another page or opens a pop up window. basically say I have a Add button which when clicked upon displays a small text input box in which I can enter stuff and submit which gets updated to the database. Sorry if it sounds noobish, I am one :P
[04:09:53] <Cork> pikapika: just add the form to the page
[04:10:12] <Cork> set the outer most parent to display: none;
[04:10:27] <Cork> or even better visible and in place and .hide() on page load
[04:10:47] <Cork> then bind an ajax for submit on it (with an http post fallback for none js use)
[04:11:44] <Nephro> If I generate a list of checkbox-inputfield pairs, and the needed functionality is "if checkbox checked, disable input field", what is a good way of accessing the proper inputfield when handling the event of the checkbox?
[04:11:58] <pikapika> Cork: Ok I understand what you describes but have very less clue how to achieve it
[04:12:13] <pikapika> can you pont me in the right direction please
[04:12:35] <Cork> pikapika: just write a normal form with a server that handles that
[04:12:50] <Cork> and when that is done come back and we can make the js niffy parts
[04:12:57] <Cork> (it should be fairly easy)
[04:13:17] <Cork> Nephro: how is the checkboxes related to the input fields?
[04:13:28] <Cork> in the dom i mean
[04:13:46] <Rinthe> corK:Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function js.libraries.min.js:15
[04:13:46] <Rinthe> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'waypoint' gritty.js:273
[04:13:46] <Rinthe> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'masonry'
[04:13:48] <Nephro> That's what I am trying to figure out, how would I do it properly
[04:14:49] <Cork> Nephro: there is several ways, if the checkbox is related right next to the input you just do something like $(this).prevAll('input').last().toggle()
[04:15:41] <Cork> Nephro: if they are in two lists not really related unless through order do something like inputlist.eq(checkboxlist.index(this)).toggle()
[04:17:56] <shoky> you'd wanna .first() on prevAll :P
[04:19:33] <Cork> shoky: does prevAll return them in revert order?
[04:19:41] <shoky> yap
[04:19:41] <Cork> i always forget
[04:19:54] <Cork> i was sitting and tried to remember as i typed it :D
[04:20:55] <shoky> ;D
[04:48:01] <anli> Is there some function that can be used in a keydown handler to calculate the resulting text in a textbox?
[04:48:11] <anli> When a keypress has been applied
[04:48:38] <fabioportieri> what do you mean by calculate the resulting text?
[04:49:11] <anli> What would the textbox contain afterwards
[04:50:30] <fabioportieri> .val() ?
[04:52:13] <anli> That is the text before the keypress has been applied
[04:52:38] <anli> Hm, maybe I could just create a dummy textbox and have it hidden
[04:53:11] <anli> And put all keypresses there
[04:55:14] <fabioportieri> anli: keyUp
[04:55:34] <anli> But I need also need to cancel the keypress
[04:56:52] <fabioportieri> then val(). + String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode)
[04:57:03] <Rinthe> what takes up most resources when your loading a blog with infinite scrolling?
[04:57:12] <anli> fabioportieri: In a very simplified world
[04:58:12] <fabioportieri> uh?
[04:58:31] <anli> A key press isnt necessarily a character
[04:59:33] <seutje> and a character isn't necessarily a keypress
[04:59:48] <fabioportieri> and mymoma isn't necessarily yomoma
[04:59:55] <seutje> webdev is so deep
[05:00:04] <fabioportieri> ahah
[05:01:49] <anli> lol :)
[05:10:41] <krad> hi.  how to print all html that is inside <body> ?
[05:13:48] <seutje> document.body.innerHTML
[05:14:28] <krad> seutje.. you sure it's that?
[05:15:15] <seutje> `mdn element.innerHTML
[05:15:16] <b-ot> seutje: element.innerHTML - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.innerHTML
[05:18:26] <anli> Will the variable this contain something else if I call a function?
[05:18:48] <Cork> anli: depends on how you call it
[05:18:57] <mogaj> how to change dialog content to  render directly in page
[05:19:22] <Cork> mogaj: what?
[05:20:02] <anli> http://pastebin.com/qesctaBE , sorry for the big indentations, seems like box.val() causes problems
[05:20:04] <fabioportieri> anli: you can use $.proxy for keeping the old reference to this
[05:20:12] <anli> ah
[05:20:17] <anli> should try that
[05:20:45] <Cork> anli:  use .call
[05:20:56] <anli> ah
[05:21:07] <anli> To not have to use $.proxy?
[05:21:09] <Cork> calc_text.call(this, e.charCode);
[05:21:11] <Cork> no
[05:21:18] <anli> Whats the reason?
[05:21:30] <Cork> cause you want to forward the current this object
[05:21:52] <Cork> proxy is to add a wrapping function around the function that sets a static this variable
[05:21:52] <anli> I thought that was what $.proxy did
[05:21:57] <anli> ok
[05:22:07] <Cork> and never changes
[05:22:07] <fabioportieri> no proxy prevents you to do so
[05:22:52] <anli> ok
[05:23:02] <anli> I am getting g.nodeName is undefined
[05:23:04] <Cork> also normally it's better to just store the this variable in a variable if you need it
[05:23:06] <krad> seutje, but i'm printing html inside html, how will that work?  i need to escape the code.  what's the html tag for that
[05:23:12] <Cork> cause $.proxy is really slow
[05:23:25] <anli> It does not matter if it is slow
[05:24:24] <mogaj> Cork : right now i have a dialog box which opens when click a link ... how can i change it show in the page itself without opening as dialog when i click the link?
[05:25:00] <Cork> mogaj: are you talking about a popup or, jquery dialog, or?
[05:25:31] <mogaj> Cork : jquery dialog
[05:25:46] <Cork> ok, then you have a click handler that opens the content in a dialog instead
[05:25:50] <Cork> add an exception to that
[05:25:56] <Trisox> o/
[05:27:04] <mogaj> Cork : click handler for the link?
[05:27:21] <Cork> yes
[05:27:31] <Cork> and no i can't give you a "how does it look"
[05:28:07] <mogaj> Cork : thank you i will take it from here
[05:28:34] <seutje> krad: var foo = document.createElement('div'); foo.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML; document.body.appendChild(foo); should work fine
[05:30:35] <krad> seutje, this would interpret the html
[05:30:53] <seutje> oh
[05:31:05] <seutje> foo.innerText = document.body.innerHTML then, I guess
[05:32:09] <Cork> innerText isn't cross browser!
[05:32:21] <Cork> i would recommend using $().text()
[05:32:38] <Cork> or you would have to use innerText and txtContent
[05:32:55] <krad> text() would print the text only and not all inner tags
[05:32:56] <Cork> *textContent
[05:33:06] <seutje> `mdn innertext
[05:33:06] <b-ot> seutje: Node.textContent - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.textContent
[05:33:08] <Cork> for setting
[05:33:28] <seutje> well I'll be damned, IE8 again
[05:37:13] <Cork> sadly innerText is prob the ie specific value that has stuck most in ppls mind
[05:37:37] <Cork> and the fact that most browsers try to emulate ie innerText ...
[05:37:43] <Cork> sucks
[05:37:48] <seutje> yeah, never had it fail tbh
[05:38:17] <seutje> so... turns out nesting <svg> tags is kinda bad
[05:38:51] <seutje> none of the svg to canvas libraries I've tried seem to support it properly
[05:40:07] <Cork> seutje: means you either never use it in live sites, or you don't test in gecko (ouch)
[05:40:32] <seutje> what if it's both? :P
[05:40:45] <Cork> 1>&2
[05:40:47] <seutje> it's all about those POCs in chrome canary :P
[05:41:01] <seutje> -webkit- all the things!
[05:41:22] <Cork> chrome is becoming worse and worse as a browser if you want your page to be standard complient
[05:41:27] <Cork> *compliant
[05:41:43] <seutje> I'm jk, most of the production sites I've worked on already have a dependency on the jQueries
[05:41:55] <Cork> seutje: and i'm actually serious
[05:42:10] <seutje> fixing broken markup is near impossible in chrome nowadays
[05:42:19] <Cork> blink team put forward serious commitment to standards, but chrome is "we do what we want"
[05:42:41] <seutje> Cork: I generally don't test all that much, got dedicated ppl for that
[05:42:52] <Cork> seutje: damn your lucky
[05:43:00] <seutje> I only fire up FF when they file an issue
[05:43:03] <paul_briggs> I was reading through core.js, and noticed a "};" was tabbed over too much (line 74)... is something like that "worthy" of a pull request, or is something like that too trivial?
[05:43:28] <Anticom> hi all
[05:43:34] <Cork> paul_briggs: core.js?
[05:43:40] <Cork> for jquery you mena?
[05:43:52] <paul_briggs> yeah... https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js
[05:44:04] <Anticom> i've got an input[type=text] which should filter a table for a certain columns cell
[05:44:09] <Anticom> how would i do that?
[05:44:13] <Anticom> regex?
[05:44:28] <Cork> paul_briggs: where?
[05:44:45] <seutje> paul_briggs: what makes u say it's tabbed too far?
[05:44:51] <Anticom> the search should be performed like "%myTerm%" in MySQL syntax... don't know how else i could explain it
[05:45:01] <seutje> matches the "completed =" indentation
[05:45:01] <Cork> can't see anything wrong there
[05:45:02] <paul_briggs> tabbed:  line 74 the "};" here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js
[05:45:24] <seutje> u can link straight to the line https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L74
[05:45:24] <Cork> it alines perfectly with completed = function() {
[05:45:52] <Anticom> oh :contains() seems to be what i want^^
[05:47:03] <Cork> man i get irked every time i see someone derides to use :contains...
[05:47:38] <Anticom> how do i select the second td of every tr?
[05:47:44] <Anticom> can i do that in one query?
[05:47:48] <paul_briggs> cork:  ahh... your right... I was connecting it higher... I see line 74 is fine.  thanks.

What would be the best way in jquery to get this list as a js object like  products: { foo: 1, bar: 23, baz: "zomg"} ? 1,23 and "zomg" are the respective values of the text inputs
[06:42:37] <webstenno> let it be "1" instead of 1 for convenience
[06:46:48] <webstenno> hmm, i will try serializeArray() i think
[06:52:05] <webstenno> ahh, i can make the rest with underscore i think, serializeArray() works fine for now

I do this with $('#input_text').prop('disabled', false); but when I hit f5 now, the text fi
[07:28:22] <Rinthe> am i doing this right? http://jsbin.com/ibasic/1/
[07:32:15] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: could you please fiddel this. so I can actually see what you are doing
[07:32:47] <c4ptnh00k> Rinthe: must not be I justget a white page lol
[07:33:06] <Rinthe> its a part of a infinitescroll
[07:33:14] <Rinthe> can you help me out?
[07:33:32] <Schonert> is there some way to get around jquery overriding inline styles?
[07:34:21] <c4ptnh00k> Rinthe: I can not see you jsbin. it just takes me to a blank page
[07:35:22] <Rinthe> c4ptnh: http://jsbin.com/ibasic/1/ click javascript
[07:35:22] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: it looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qfSAc/ but refreshing the page will disable the box again, on my local machine it still is enabled
[07:35:25] <c4ptnh00k> Schonert: this an animation?
[07:37:05] <Schonert> no just raw css c4ptnh00k
[07:37:09] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: try adding a link that disables the text again. But if it works in jsfiddle and not on your page then that doesnt help us much. We need to be able to reproduce the error
[07:39:20] <c4ptnh00k> Schonert:  if you use the !important tag in your css it will override the jquery rule
[07:40:24] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: are you using any postbacks?
[07:40:33] <Schonert> c4ptnh00k i generate divs with backgrounds, so that i can take advantage of the cover size. When i do $(el).css(somthign), it just makes a new style="somadsd"
[07:41:06] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: nope give me a sec ill try to give a better example
[07:42:26] <c4ptnh00k> Schonert: Just overide the .css you dont have to rewrite the whole thing but if there are some jquery styling you want to change then just add it and use the !important tag. Otherwise you can just go into the jquery.css file and change it there
[07:43:30] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: http://imatestpage.bplaced.net/test.php hit the link -> the text box will be enabled -> refresh, textbox still enabled
[07:44:42] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: nope it is disabled everytime i refresh. try clearing your cache
[07:45:24] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: What browser are you using
[07:46:58] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: im using firefox
[07:47:09] <anli> Can I turn off pasting of text in a textbox?
[07:47:14] <TheHatHatter> now thats weird

[07:47:41] <mentoc> anli: I believe you can.. you just need to catch the character codes and do nothing
[07:48:07] <fabioportieri> anli: try  $('#txtInput').bind("cut copy paste",function(e) {           e.preventDefault();       });
[07:48:21] <anli> cool
[07:48:27] <fabioportieri> s/bind/on
[07:48:28] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: still enabled for me
[07:48:29] <mentoc> fabioportieri: whoa, that's awesome
[07:48:38] <Rinthe> http://codebin.org/view/321974e4 is this the most efficient way to get currentPage ?
[07:49:01] <anli> Why not bind?
[07:49:08] <proudbeard> Hello! Does anyone know if it's possible to resize a "resizable div" from a number input?
[07:49:18] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: do you use firefox, too?
[07:49:36] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: not usually but for this one im grabbing it now
[07:50:03] <mentoc> proudbeard: take the input value and adjust the div accordingly through height and width style attributes
[07:51:18] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: alright so i tried it with chrome and it does indeed disable the box after refresh
[07:51:30] <fabioportieri> As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document
[07:52:18] <mentoc> How do I apply a bind to each one of my tags that contain the same class?
[07:52:28] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: yup just confirmed this is a firefox related problem
[07:52:31] <fabioportieri> $(".class").bind
[07:52:39] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: so any workaround?
[07:52:43] <mentoc> fabioportieri: you are awesome
[07:52:51] <fabioportieri> lol
[07:53:29] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: working on it
[07:53:30] <Rinthe> aynone?
[07:53:33] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: because i also tried adding a <input type="hidden"> and give it a value like <input type="hidden" value="enabled"> but once i refresh the page it still has the value "enabled"
[07:53:53] <TheHatHatter> thanks man
[07:54:25] <fabioportieri> TheHatHatter: try using a document.ready and reset the value in it
[07:54:58] <TheHatHatter> fabioportieri: im not sure i understand what you mean
[07:55:07] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: Well firfox has a known problem of caching values. it has nothing to do with dom being ready
[07:55:32] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: alright
[07:55:52] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: press ctrl+f5
[07:56:11] <fabioportieri> $(document).ready(function(){     $("#yourInput").attr("disabled","disabled");  });
[07:57:16] <c4ptnh00k> fabioportieri: if you look at his code he actually already does that.
[07:57:32] <fabioportieri> oh, i didn't look
[07:57:41] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: okay yea thats working. fabioportieri: that works, thanks ;)
[07:58:39] <c4ptnh00k> The Problem is firefox caching form values. Another reason use chrome
[07:59:18] <TheHatHatter> c4ptnh00k: well, i cant just code for the chrome users :)
[07:59:19] <fabioportieri> can't you decache them?
[07:59:42] <fabioportieri> i mean reset all the form values
[08:00:07] <c4ptnh00k> TheHatHatter: No you can not but you can code for the greatest common denominator which is chrome and ie.
[08:00:08] <TheHatHatter> well, the $('#input').attr('disabled','disabled') in the document.ready solved the problem though
[08:00:25] <TheHatHatter> hm..
[08:00:53] <TheHatHatter> i grew up with firefox and it always did a good job for me :x
[08:01:00] <c4ptnh00k> its a string property with a string value... just because it looks like it does the job doesnt mean its right
[08:01:29] <Josh_> can anyone help me please :)
[08:01:35] <Josh_> Its been long my question is gone
[08:01:38] <Josh_> Let me resay it
[08:01:43] <Josh_> So, Tabs from Jquery UI ... I am trying to add a tab but for adding it you need to call tabs("refresh");
[08:01:46] <Josh_> which refreshes entire page.
[08:01:49] <Josh_> How to avoid that?
[08:01:50] <TheHatHatter> $("#input_text").prop('disabled', true); works just as fine
[08:02:13] <Rinthe> http://codebin.org/view/321974e4 is this the most efficient way to get currentPage ?
[08:02:17] <Josh_> TheHatHatter, Help me too : )
[08:02:18] <Josh_> please.
[08:02:49] <fabioportieri> Josh_: look here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14702631/in-jquery-ui-1-9-how-do-you-create-new-tabs-dynamically
[08:02:54] <TheHatHatter> Josh_: I'm sorry I think I cant help you :x
[08:03:07] <c4ptnh00k> Bah humbug. dont want the best answer then I wont help.
[08:03:41] <fabioportieri> oh, it uses refresh nvm
[08:04:56] <TheHatHatter> thanks guys, i gotta go, bye :)
[08:05:22] <Josh_> fabioportieri, Exactly.
[08:05:26] <fabioportieri> Josh_: you could use this as a hack, instead of refresh you do tabs.tabs("destroy");  and tabs.tabs();
[08:05:33] <Josh_> Ah
[08:05:35] <Josh_> fabioportieri, True.
[08:05:49] <fabioportieri> and see what happens
[08:05:52] <Josh_> :D
[08:05:55] <Josh_> Alright
[08:06:17] <mentoc> Is there any way to see the status of a fade toggle?
[08:06:26] <Rinthe> http://codebin.org/view/0907f7d9 anyone know why this onyl works in chrome, and not FF or IE?
[08:11:04] <fRAiLtY-> How to make this fire the valid e-mail check before sending the form http://jsfiddle.net/YSGpM/1/
[08:13:20] <koskoz> hi, I've got a weird behavior. I do this: $("#popin-login, #veil").fadeOut("slow");  then this: $("#popin-login, #veil").fadeIn("slow"); but inside #popin-login a h2 keeps it's display: none after the fadeIn oO
[08:14:27] <BillCris_> fRAiLtY-: Check it on the submit event of the form.
[08:14:29] <c4ptnh00k> fRAiLtY-: you would need to stop the submit event or "catch" it
[08:14:57] <Anticom> Rinthe $(document) inside $(document) ?!
[08:15:05] <c4ptnh00k> MrCriswell, how goes it?
[08:15:21] <Anticom> irrc $(document) is a shortcut for $(document).ready()
[08:15:30] <BillCris_> It's all right. Working.
[08:15:31] <BillCris_> You?
[08:15:39] <c4ptnh00k> same. New alias?
[08:16:11] <BillCris_> Ah shit, logged in from home.
[08:16:14] <BillCris_> Didn't even notice.
[08:16:23] <pachet> $(document) wraps the document node as a jquery object
[08:16:27] <fRAiLtY-> The form is submitted via ajaxForm, does this have the functionality to do what I want?
[08:16:28] <Rinthe> Anticom: changed it to this, now it doesnt work in chrome
[08:16:37] <pachet> $(function(){}) is a shortcut to what you're describing
[08:17:22] <shoky> Rinthe: im not sure but i remember that to animate scrollTop you might need $('body,html')  to get it workign in all browsers. but again, not sure at all :P
[08:17:41] <shoky> Rinthe: that is, to animate scrollTop on body,html
[08:17:54] <c4ptnh00k> fRAiLtY-: are you using a submit button or a regular input button? the jsfiddle has no ajax call
[08:18:13] <Rinthe> shoky: hmm okay i'll test it out
[08:18:17] <Rinthe> thanks for the tip
[08:18:19] <shoky> Rinthe: er also that animate call is wrong
[08:18:30] <Rinthe> it is?
[08:18:31] <shoky> Rinthe:  scrollTop is an animated property,  duration is an animation option
[08:18:44] <shoky> they're not supposed to be in the same object argument to .animate
[08:18:53] <fabioportieri> bye
[08:18:54] <banisterfiend> anyone here familiar with bacon.js ?
[08:19:10] <Rinthe> shoky: so how do i set how long it'll be?
[08:19:13] <shoky> Rinthe:  .animate( properties, options )
[08:19:25] <Rinthe> shoky: ur right: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8149155/animate-scrolltop-not-working-in-firefox
[08:20:08] <shoky> .animate({scrollTop:0}, {duration:300})   or just  .animate({scrollTop:0}, 300)
[08:20:16] <shoky> Rinthe ^
[08:21:42] <Rinthe> shoky: dang how can u keep track of all this haha
[08:22:23] <fRAiLtY-> c4ptnh00k:  Sorry, no ajax thinking of something else. Just a standard input type="submit"
[08:23:28] <shoky> Rinthe: heh probably mostly from helping folks out here ;p
[08:23:29] <c4ptnh00k> fRAiLtY-: Then use $('#target').submit(function() {alert('Handler for .submit() called.');return false;});
[08:23:30] <Rinthe> shoky: yay works! thanks :)
[08:23:35] <Rinthe> shoky heehe:)
[08:23:48] <shoky> np
[08:24:41] <justpie> Hey all, does anyone know if jquery confilicts with prototype.js ?

[08:25:00] <c4ptnh00k> justpie: well I have google

[08:27:13] <IHT> Guys, what's up with this? I'm using .replaceWith function <a></a> tag that also has a new ID. After the replacement, why can't JavaScript run the function with the new ID?
[08:27:19] <justpie> c4ptnh00k : I found that as well. i am using $ rather than jquery. Maybe ill switch it and see if it works
[08:27:51] <c4ptnh00k> cwatson: That's pretty cool
[08:28:08] <cwatson> c4ptnh00k: :)
[08:28:39] <cwatson> c4ptnh00k: So use jquery for browser quirks, not performance. In this case, create dom elements.
[08:30:17] <c4ptnh00k> cwatson: performance is relative. There are many things that can trump it in modern web design.
[08:31:43] <cwatson> c4ptnh00k: which one is faster and slower than the other? HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I know it depends, but in general.
[08:35:49] <c4ptnh00k> cwatson: Oh you are def right. I am not arguing that point. I am merely saying that jquery might sacrifice a little speed but it adds more than it takes away an a lot of cases.
[08:36:04] <c4ptnh00k> in a*
[08:37:04] <sam452> join #ios
[08:37:08] <cwatson> c4ptnh00k: Right. jQuery is good at what it does. Cross-browser compatibility, not exactly performance.
[08:37:27] <cwatson> c4ptnh00k: So write less, load more
[08:37:28] <cwatson> :-P
[08:37:36] <jedimind> cwatson that's where jquery 2.0 comes into play
[08:37:45] <jedimind> performance vs cross-browser
[08:37:54] <cwatson> jedimind: Oh, snap. Good point.
[08:38:03] <cwatson> jedimind: I think it's still slow.
[08:38:12] * jedimind shrugs
[08:38:16] <c4ptnh00k> Tis why we are padawan to jedi
[08:39:01] <cwatson> lol
[08:39:05] <cwatson> http://jsfiddle.net/VWkS2/2/
[08:39:50] <cwatson> Numbers don't lie. ;)
[08:40:25] <jedimind> to be fair, it is beta, but also probably wont be the same as vanilla, ever
[08:40:28] <jedimind> its unpossible
[08:40:43] <cwatson> Right.

[09:22:07] <driip> Hello, i was wondering if anyone have any experience with handling a DataTable filter which is supposed to filter by numbers. IE if i have the number 7 it would not include the number 17 its result
[09:22:09] <Rinthe> there's .replaceWith()
[09:22:12] <Rinthe> is there a copy?
[09:22:27] <Rinthe> like .copy()
[09:22:58] <BillCris_> .clone()
[09:23:05] <Rinthe> billcris: thanks
[09:23:18] <Rinthe> billcris; does replaceWith() actaully gets rid of the original content?
[09:24:08] <BillCris_> Yes. You can save them by using it like this though... var old = $('.foo').replaceWith('.bar'); and old will contain the old html.. I believe.
[09:24:35] <Rinthe> billcris: I mean is the content that replacewith() TOOK FROM removed?
[09:24:45] <BillCris_> Rinthe: Yes.
[09:25:28] <BillCris_> Rinthe: http://jsbin.com/otolac/1/edit
[09:25:29] <Rinthe> i see, i could just use clone
[09:25:53] <Rinthe> problem is i need to use this data in 2 very different places
[09:26:45] <BillCris_> Rinthe: Hard to know the best thing to do ( maybe ) without all the details haha
[09:27:46] <Rinthe> can i create a variable in one function that i can use in another
[09:28:05] <Rinthe> nm

[09:33:21] <juicebocks> Hi, I'm creating a panel in jqm 1.3.1 creating the panel when each page is created in order to create a custom panel for  each page, but without having a bunch of cut and paste for each page.  Everything works great except the data-rel="close" doesn't close the panel and return to the current page.  Any initial thoughts?
[09:34:13] <juicebocks> I'm doing a "pagecreate" in the pagebefore show.  If I didn't the same html statically for the menu it works fine.

[09:56:36] <jim_j> hi
[09:57:02] <jim_j> what's the most compact way to force a user to check a checkbox with the error message if they submit without it?
[09:58:55] <rb-> make no checkbox?
[10:00:29] <jim_j> rb-, what if I have a checkbox, like a 'user agreement' checkbox
[10:01:01] <rb-> you can write "by submiting this form you agree to our terms and blah blah"
[10:01:19] <rb-> because checkbox is when user has a choice
[10:01:31] <rb-> otherwise there's no reason to put in there
[10:01:35] <rb-> IMO
[10:01:50] <jim_j> but is there a 'required' parameter for checkboxes
[10:02:22] <rb-> try to add required="required"
[10:02:40] <rb-> and then check with jquery
[10:02:55] <jim_j> rb-, cool thanks
[10:04:40] <rb-> jim_j, oh, you don't need jquery actually
[10:04:54] <jim_j> rb-, you mean with just required = "required"?
[10:05:17] <rb-> <input type="checkbox" required="required">
[10:05:27] <jim_j> rb-, what about the custom message?
[10:05:56] <rb-> then you need to use jquery
[10:06:27] <jim_j> or maybe placeholder="" ?

[10:22:26] <clov3r> not sure
[10:22:33] <clov3r> never used jq ui tabs
[10:23:51] <clov3r> what's the context?
[10:23:59] <rb-> Josh_: well, it shouldn't do that. Have you checked this example? http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#entry-examples
[10:24:46] <Josh_> rb-, You don't add new tabs in that example
[10:24:53] <Josh_> rb-, http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation
[10:25:04] <rb-> oh yeah, my bad
[10:25:05] <Josh_> Line 62
[10:28:57] <clov3r> Josh... doesn't appear to be refreshing the entire page here...
[10:29:51] <clov3r> i know little...
[10:30:05] <clov3r> but i don't see in the api for refresh that it page refreshes...
[10:30:22] <clov3r> refresh()
[10:30:22] <clov3r> Process any tabs that were added or removed directly in the DOM and recompute the height of the tab panels. Results depend on the content and the heightStyle option.
[10:30:44] <clov3r> certainly i don't get any net requests logged when adding tabs in the example
[10:41:34] <finnnnnnnnnnn> anyone know if there's a library/plugin I can use to convert numbers from 1 to 1st, 2 to 2nd and so on?
[10:43:45] <BillCris_> Could you just grab the last number and use a switch case on that?
[10:45:19] <clov3r> (remember to include the case 11th, 12th, 13th
[10:46:09] <BillCris_> Ah, there goes my idea.
[10:46:13] <BillCris_> Doesn't sound like fun.
[10:46:26] <BillCris_> Well, still relatively close.
[10:46:36] <BillCris_> clov3r: What do you call the "th", "st", "nd" etc?
[10:47:08] <BillCris_> ah, ordinal.

[10:49:00] <BillCris_> I wonder why they do: var ordinal = function ordinal(){ ... }

[10:57:06] <RSDRSDRSD> I have built a chat using jquery
[10:57:11] <RSDRSDRSD> But now I want to optimize
[10:57:16] <RSDRSDRSD> what can i best do
[10:57:54] <houser> RSDRSDRSD, delete it ;)
[10:57:55] <RSDRSDRSD> save all references to dom elements or use constantly something like $(.messagelist,messagelists)
[10:58:13] <houser> RSDRSDRSD, use $
[10:58:36] <RSDRSDRSD> or do something like this.messagelist = $(.messagelist,messagelists)
[10:58:43] <RSDRSDRSD> and use this.messagelist
[10:59:00] <RSDRSDRSD> I have a lot of different messagelist divs
[10:59:03] <RSDRSDRSD> with all messages
[10:59:20] <RSDRSDRSD> and people can do private chat with each other and every private chat is a div
[11:00:17] <_jo_> Ohai #jquery.
[11:00:31] <RSDRSDRSD> so should I save all references to the different $ or is it better to create the $ on the fly
[11:01:48] <clov3r> i think its faster to $(element) = $element; if you're going to be accessing it a lot
[11:03:28] <banister`shop> clov3r: dont u mean $element = $(element) ?
[11:03:39] <clov3r> oh
[11:03:41] <clov3r> yes yes i do
[11:03:47] <RSDRSDRSD> also if I have about 300 elements in it?
[11:03:57] <RSDRSDRSD> and 300 elements of that kind
[11:14:21] <BillCris_> Tried in #javascript, no insight.... So I'll try here: I just came across a function written like var ordinal = function ordinal() {...}.. Is there a reason for that over var ordinal = function(){ ... } or function ordinal(){ ... } ?
[11:15:00] <clov3r> BillCriswell, I asked the author too, no response
[11:15:24] <BillCris_> They're keeping javascript secrets from us. ='(
[11:16:19] <clov3r> :P
[11:16:34] <clov3r> is #javascript, like, waaaaay cooler than ##javscript?
[11:16:36] <clov3r> i bet it is
[11:16:46] <clov3r> :p
[11:16:54] <murftown> BillCris_: I don't know of any difference.
[11:17:15] <BillCris_> clov3r: I meant ## haha.
[11:17:17] <BillCris_> murftown: Hm
[11:17:56] <murftown> BillCris_: but there could easily be some subtle difference I'm not aware of
[11:18:25] <BillCris_> murftown: That's what I'm thinking. I'm just wondering why the author would repeat himself.
[11:19:05] <s5fs> BillCris_: var blah = function() is assigning an anonymous function to a variable, yes?
[11:19:19] <s5fs> BillCris_: so var blah = function named() is assigning a named function a variable, yes?
[11:19:43] <s5fs> so.. in theory (i have not tried).. if you are debugging, you'll see the function name in your call stack, if you name the function.
[11:20:48] <BillCris_> s5fs: That could be a good reason.
[11:21:18] <s5fs> BillCris_: a while ago i was doing some derpy stuff loading anon functions into an array, and lemme tell you, naming those guys was a lifesaver.
[11:22:12] <dcherman2> BillCris_: the difference is explained in the spec ( Function Declaration vs Function Expression ) - http://es5.github.io/#x13
[11:23:07] <BillCris_> s5fs: dcherman2: Very interesting. Thanks!
[11:23:34] <dcherman2> BillCris_: in short, they're similar in use but are initialized differently and have slightly different semantics - you can't use .call on a function declaration for example, but you can on an expression ( hence the term immediately invoked function expression )
[11:24:41] <BillCris_> dcherman2: That's way more than I knew of.
[11:25:17] <BillCris_> I still can't read specifications as clearly as I'd like.
[11:28:32] <clov3r> you and me both
[11:28:53] <BillCris_> I'd read the hell out of them if I did haha.
[11:29:00] <clov3r> for some reason, i can't even focus get my eyes to focus on the words in specs...
[11:31:00] <BillCris_> clov3r: Understood totally.
[11:33:58] <dcherman> BillCris_: you're only going to get better at reading the spec by reading the spec :/
[11:34:59] <BillCris_> dcherman: That's what I'm afraid of :)
[11:39:53] <RSDRSDRSD> there is a difference
[11:40:19] <RSDRSDRSD> if you want to reference your function in your own function it is sometimes not possible
[11:42:16] <lroe> will an 'animate' function survive a reload?
[11:42:24] <RSDRSDRSD> if your local variable ordinal is not accessible, in the function ordinal than you can access it if you use function ordinal()
[11:44:13] <RSDRSDRSD> if your local variable var ordinal = function() {} is not accessible in the function itself than you can access it if you use var ordinal = function ordinal() {} than it is always accessible
[11:45:09] <RSDRSDRSD> if you use var thisfunc = function otherfunc() {}   than otherfunc(); isnt wokring in the outer scope
[11:45:31] <RSDRSDRSD> you can just use thisfunc() in the outher scope
[11:46:18] <RSDRSDRSD> everything is rebuild ater a reload
[11:46:27] <RSDRSDRSD> so I don think it will survive
[11:48:37] <Pritchard> We're using jQuery UI 1.10.2's autocomplete feature and have discovered that when used in a dialog, when CLICKING an autocomplete item, focus returns to the first input in the dialog in IE 8.
[11:49:42] <Pritchard> This is a project for the state and they use IE exclusively.  IE8 is their primary browser.  Forms being auto-scrolled back to the top in IE8 after clicking an autocomplete suggestion is currently our biggest complaint from users.
[11:52:42] <HarryPitfall> I have another oddity about autocomplete and dialogs...
[11:53:08] <HarryPitfall> the menu of autocomplete inside a dialog sometimes 'go crazy' and don't position correct
[11:53:21] <HarryPitfall> even with the parameters to adjust
[11:54:01] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[11:54:22] <Germanaz0> I have 2 timezones, i need to convert one timestamp in both of them
[11:54:24] <Pritchard> Strange.  We never encountered that issue, sorry.  Autocomplete has been working great for us overall.  However, UI issues have appeared in IE8 since we upgraded jQuery UI about a month ago.
[11:54:35] <Germanaz0> anyone knows how to deal with timezones and JS ?
[11:56:17] <thujone> yeah, you probably want to use a timezone library
[11:56:52] <thujone> you don't want to do it yourself, it's too much work
[11:57:00] <thujone> you have daylight savings time and other issues
[11:57:30] <Rikle_S> Hi
[11:57:31] <Germanaz0> ok
[11:57:32] <Germanaz0> thnx
[11:59:19] <Rikle_S> i am in a div, and in the same level, i'd like to select another div, whitch has a class, but not all same classes in others div
[11:59:33] <Rikle_S> how can i do it with jquery ?
[12:01:37] <Pritchard> Rikle_S:  I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but $(div).siblings(".className") may work for you.
[12:01:46] <clov3r> $(this).siblings('.your-class')
[12:01:52] <clov3r> yep ^^
[12:01:53] <clov3r>  :)
[12:04:56] <jlang> Hi all, would anyone have any input on fixing some problems related to Jquery Mobile and android 2.x phones not triggering the  event on the element that was touched but one nearby similar to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3073?
[12:05:02] <Rikle_S> Pritchard clov3r http://paste.laravel.com/uPh
[12:05:49] <Rikle_S> is it more clear ?
[12:07:23] <Pritchard> Rikle_S:  No, not for me.
[12:08:33] <Rikle_S> Pritchard: in this code, i'd like to select div.collornext to add a class on it
[12:08:53] <Qiller> hi all, i have two rows with 4 columns each. Total 8 items. im using .odd to set background color. its work fine! but, i need invert color start when go to a new row. anyone can help me?
[12:09:13] <Pritchard> Rikle_S:  Your code looks fine to me.
[12:09:33] <Rikle_S> it doesn't work :/
[12:09:45] <Pritchard> Rikle_S:  I'm not sure what jQuery does in that instance, but you may need to do a forEach.
[12:09:59] <wilkinsmc> since when is $60 to repair a computer expensive
[12:10:01] <Pritchard> And add that class to each and every instance of ".colornext"
[12:10:11] <wilkinsmc> i mean, this is one of my first customers, but i won't work for bubble gum
[12:10:37] <Qiller> any ?
[12:10:51] <clov3r> wilkinsmc: not expensive at all
[12:11:36] <clov3r> i had to pay over $100 just for someone to install LINUX on my comp
[12:12:18] <clov3r> :S
[12:12:33] <clov3r> should have spent that money on a USB cd drive and done it myself
[12:12:37] <Qiller> hi all, i have two rows with 4 columns each. Total 8 items. im using .odd to set background color. its work fine! but, i need invert color start when go to a new row. anyone can help me?
[12:12:37] <clov3r> but there you go
[12:13:27] <Qiller> Pritchard: can u help me?
[12:13:39] <Pritchard> Qiller:  I don't understand your problem.
[12:14:22] <Pritchard> Please use jsfiddle or jsbin and post fully-functional, minimal examples of the problems you are having.
[12:14:52] <Qiller> Pritchard: two rows, 4 columns = 8 items. ok? i'm using .ODD to colorize a background. But, i want colorize reverse order when go to row 1 to row 2
[12:15:08] <Pritchard> Qiller:  I know basic arithmetic.  Don't insult me.
[12:15:32] <Pritchard> Post a functional, minimal example and I or someone else can help.
[12:15:56] <Qiller> Pritchard: Sry, i dont speak english, i say my detailed problem
[12:16:11] <Qiller> [1][2][1][2] - NEW LINEM WITH REVERSE COLORS. [2][1][2][1][2]
[12:16:21] <Qiller> sry caps
[12:16:33] <Pritchard> Qiller:  So you want to recolor everything?
[12:16:48] <clov3r> qiller: probably you want some css rules, like row.odd col.odd {bg-color: red} row.even col.even {bg-color: red}
[12:17:58] <Qiller> Pritchard: yep, recolor with reverse color order. if im going to new line, reverse color order - green - gray - green - gray (new line) reverse gray - green - gray - green
[12:18:15] <Qiller> clov3r: hmm, testing.
[12:20:08] <Qiller> help me Christopher =D
[12:29:11] <wilkinsmc> in what universe is 60 bucks too much for repair
[12:30:49] <wilkinsmc> granted, i'm just flashing the bios, but good luck getting best buy to do it for 60
[12:30:52] <wilkinsmc> or doing it herself
[12:31:26] <clov3r> well i bet she'd learn a lot :D
[12:31:36] <clov3r> might take six months to get the computer running again
[12:31:40] <clov3r> that's how i learned?

[12:46:14] <diamonds> hey
[12:46:15] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/kuKXQ/
[12:46:41] <diamonds> I'm trying to demonstrate an issue I'm having with the LocalScroll plugin but I can't get either plugin to load properly in jsfiddle
[12:48:00] <c4ptnh00k> diamonds: you need to click external resources and add the url to the js there
[12:48:15] <diamonds> c4ptnh00k» what url?
[12:48:27] <diamonds> I tried the location on github but jsfiddle does not like that
[12:49:07] <diamonds> ok it's loading now, let me attempt to recreate my issue
[12:50:23] <diamonds> shiiit. can't reproduce on jsfiddle of course
[12:50:40] <BillCris_> diamonds: jsfiddle is great because of that.
[12:51:25] <diamonds> aargh.
[12:51:38] <diamonds> anyway my onAfter function isn't running in my local application
[12:51:58] <diamonds> I set a breakpoint before it enters $().animate() to ensure that the function is intact
[12:52:15] <diamonds> from there on in it's jquery internals and I don't really want to chase it around there, plus I ASSUME it works
[13:13:38] <diamonds> can anything cause the `after` callback not to be called in $().animate?
[13:16:44] <Nytician> hi there, I'm using require js and its awesome but one thing, often when I refresh the page I get 'undefined' errors with my scripts.. but other times they will work fine! Any idea whats up? Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/pSpmcjyU
[13:19:13] <bil> Nytician: i've only been using requires for about a week, but maybe your dependencies aren't established properly?
[13:19:22] <Nytician> oh?
[13:19:26] <Nytician> how would I do that?
[13:21:05] <bil> Your paste bin doesn't really show what you're trying to do
[13:21:43] <Nytician> I have two other files that I want to include thats pretty much it, what info do you need I can give it np
[13:24:15] <porton> I need to send data from my JavaScript to the server. Can jQuery encode it as JSON?
[13:24:31] <NoiseEee> porton: uh yeah
[13:24:38] <porton> NoiseEee: How?
[13:24:59] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ @ porton
[13:25:37] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't do that AFAIK.
[13:25:48] <systemfault> In fact… it's one of the only things it doesn't do..
[13:27:12] <HarryPitfall> to encode data as json, you need a  3rd party library
[13:27:40] <HarryPitfall> there is a json.js free to use, that detects if the browser have json built-in abilities
[13:27:40] <systemfault> HarryPitfall: Only for old browsers
[13:27:46] <systemfault> Right :)
[13:28:10] <HarryPitfall> I have my own encode/decode json modules...
[13:28:25] <systemfault> HarryPitfall: If you use jQuery… why?
[13:28:42] <systemfault> I mean, it has $.parseJSON… and if you need JSON.stringify, use a polyfill
[13:29:17] <HarryPitfall> parse a json is easy
[13:29:38] <HarryPitfall> if you want some safety, you can just test with regular expression
[13:29:52] <systemfault> It's not easy to do it properly… see json2.js
[13:30:54] <HarryPitfall> new Function('return '+json)()
[13:31:33] <HarryPitfall> is fine as long you have control of the source of the json data
[13:37:46] <whatever_42> hey guys. how do i keep $.parseJSON from reordering the data?
[13:38:06] <NoiseEee> whatever_42: there is no 'order' to objects.
[13:39:02] <whatever_42> well the result that is shown in the console differs from the order that is processed by jquery
[13:40:13] <NoiseEee> whatever_42: fiddle/pastebin an example?
[13:40:23] <NoiseEee> the bottom line is there is no ordering to objects really
[13:41:13] <whatever_42> this is an example result http://pastebin.com/B5Hd4egj
[13:41:24] <whatever_42> they are ordered by php according to amount
[13:41:52] <whatever_42> http://pastebin.com/7PDN3APL
[13:41:59] <whatever_42> this is the javascript code
[13:42:23] <whatever_42> and it is basically about the function getResults
[13:46:36] <whatever_42> and this right here is the result from the console.log line http://pastebin.com/pC51wTsM
[13:53:17] <whatever_42> NoiseEee?
[13:53:43] <NoiseEee> whatever_42: yeah i don't understand that example?
[13:54:38] <whatever_42> you mean the code?
[13:54:44] <whatever_42> or the example result?
[13:55:02] <clov3r> oh boi
[13:55:08] <NoiseEee> whatever_42: again, objects have no order.  when it comes back from your xhr call, its not going to be iterated in any particular order. if you want it in a particular order, consider arrays or a means of tracking the object order via another object
[13:55:20] <clov3r> don't you just hate it when you find out that all the little console.logs that you've been leaving in your scripts
[13:55:22] <NoiseEee> (truthfully, i think just chrome goes a-z on it)
[13:55:32] <clov3r> are breaking ie all across your portfolio
[13:55:40] * clov3r smacks head in palm
[13:57:21] <whatever_42> NoiseEee: in the example i posted item 4 was the first one. how ever in here http://pastebin.com/pC51wTsM it's not
[13:59:37] <NoiseEee> whatever_42: honestly i have no idea what that pastebin is reflecting
[13:59:53] <NoiseEee> whatever_42: and again, there is *no order* to objects
[14:00:53] <whatever_42> ok then how does js decide which item is first when i loop through them?
[14:01:28] <NoiseEee> it depends on the browser really, chrome will always go a-z by key
[14:03:18] <whatever_42> hmm. then apparently firefox changed it's behavior from the given order to numeric
[14:03:36] <whatever_42> can i force the browser to process them differently?
[14:04:28] <whatever_42> you are right. safari still does it the way i want it to be
[14:04:44] <abes> Hello! I have a question: how can I get all input elements BUT skip the one of type password? $('input[!=password]').function(); ???
[14:05:50] <systemfault> input:not([type="password"])    ?
[14:06:50] <abes> input:not(:password) worked
[14:06:59] <abes> :D
[14:07:05] <hazardous> hi, anyone know how i can 'fade out' an background-image (opacity: 0.4) or so while having a <h1> on top be opacity:1?
[14:07:09] <hazardous> this doesn't seem doable with css alone
[14:08:15] <pythonirc1011>  I need a container where one can drag and drop images from a page. Anyone knows how to do this?
[14:08:35] <systemfault> hazardous: It's probably possible.
[14:08:51] <hazardous> if it is i haven't figured it out :v
[14:08:51] <systemfault> hazardous: You would probably need a pseudo-element though
[14:08:57] <hazardous> yeah, i need this to work on IE
[14:09:04] <systemfault> hazardous: IE what?
[14:09:06] <hazardous> all
[14:09:08] <hazardous> at least 7
[14:09:17] <systemfault> Ah :/ Then forget it.
[14:09:20] <hazardous> i'm using angularjs/emberjs atm so the site doesn't even load without js,
[14:09:25] <hazardous> so that's why i figured i might as well use javascript for it
[14:09:39] <hazardous> systemfault: yeah, it sucks but i still have ~24% IE userbase
[14:09:42] <hazardous> <1% IE10
[14:09:42] <systemfault> Does ember even support IE7 ? :(
[14:09:52] <hazardous> it does with an absurd amount of shiv/shim/helpers!
[14:10:06] <systemfault> IE7 is the last shitty IE
[14:10:32] <systemfault> And probably the shittiest of them all..
[14:10:52] <hazardous> as far as i can tell, it seems like ie6 just straight up tells you no while ie7 tries to support stuff and then does it broken and halfassed
[14:11:28] <systemfault> hazardous: Yeah… but IE6 was wonderful when it was just released while IE7 was already an outdated browser the day of its birth
[14:11:54] <hazardous> interestingly enough ie10 appears to support <progress> and it actually looks nice
[14:12:12] <hazardous> a lot nicer than chrome or ff's
[14:12:23] <systemfault> IE8 is a good CSS2 browser :P IE9 is and IE10 are fine
[14:12:39] <hazardous> also that being said
[14:12:47] <hazardous> any idea how i can resize and grab a 'slice' of an image
[14:13:09] <hazardous> or would i be better off generating that with some kind of server side script and serving it
[14:14:08] <systemfault> hazardous: What means "grab" in that case, displaying?
[14:14:17] <wizbit> what can i do if 2x jquery libs conflict with eachother?
[14:14:20] <hazardous> displaying a slice, yeah
[14:14:39] <hazardous> like i need to resize it, grab a section of it, then apply opacity to it
[14:15:03] <systemfault> hazardous: If it's a background-image, it's impossible on older browsers
[14:15:24] <systemfault> background-size only works on newer browsers..
[14:15:26] <SproutDB> hey everyone, I am doing some research on database-as-a-service, would you please take my survey, giving away a $50 amazon gift card surveymonkey.com/s/C57JP8W
[14:17:12] <hazardous> systemfault: im more or less looking for somethin like this, if it's even possible in a sane way client-side http://i.imgur.com/zHNObt6.png
[14:18:13] <systemfault> hazardous: You could do it with JS and a <img> element
[14:18:45] <hazardous>  /win 493
[14:19:31] <hazardous> hm, what if i just drop ie7 support
[14:19:44] <hazardous> it's a gaming oriented site and a large majority of my users are on firefox and chrome
[14:21:04] <systemfault> hazardous: You won't get background-size on IE8… but you would be able to use pseudo-elements, which is great
[14:29:50] <d0100> anyone know why appending html to a sourceless iframe only works in chrome?
[14:32:59] <optiqal> Isn't there a security issue with accessing an iframe from the parent document in most browsers?
[14:33:25] <systemfault> optiqal: No, because of the same-origin policy.
[14:33:38] <systemfault> optiqal: You can only access content of frames that are on the same domain
[14:54:47] <d0100> concerning my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/LbFPu/2/ see how html only shows inside the frame when viewed with Chrom
[14:55:08] <d0100> I believe it has something to do with each browsers way of writing into the DOM?
[14:58:25] <hazardous> everypony

[15:10:40] <funhouse> plugin*
[15:11:13] <hazardous> i'm looking for one too
[15:11:20] <hazardous> i'd like something that implements ie10/metro's scrollbars or osx scrollbars on divs
[15:11:24] <hazardous> :V
[15:19:11] <funhouse> hazardous: what do you think of this --> http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/  I get errors tho,
[15:21:33] <diamonds> is it possible to `break` .each()?
[15:28:05] <funhouse> diamonds: return false
[15:28:22] <funhouse> just return will do a continue
[15:30:18] <diamonds> funhouse» that will stop all further exectution of the the callback function on any of the remaining elems?

[17:05:40] <Rinthe> if (postID = parseHtml.find('article.single')) {} would this condition return false, if it doesn't find article.single ?
[17:09:08] <_rgn> Rinthe: figure out what the return value is for .find() that doesn't find anything, then you can see if it evaluates to false
[17:09:45] <Rinthe> rgn: how about if (postID = parseHtml.find('article.single').attr('id')) {}
[17:12:51] <systemfault> jQuery never returns false for finding elements
[17:13:12] <systemfault> You get an empty jQuery (array-like) object

[17:55:51] <jrockjiggz> its a project management tool run from terminal. it allows you to build new projects with components (jquery, twitter bootstrap, angular, etc).
[17:55:56] <systemfault> yeoman?
[17:55:58] <systemfault> bower?
[17:56:01] <rmurphey> require?
[17:56:08] <systemfault> browserify?
[17:56:21] <jrockjiggz> yeoman :)
[17:56:33] <systemfault> Where's the R? :P
[17:56:37] <jrockjiggz> i'm just putting together some standard component a new projects SHOULD have at least
[17:56:49] <jrockjiggz> R is my memory going up in smoke lol
[17:57:40] <jrockjiggz> I'm also expecting for php backend minimum framework Zend, CakePHP or Symfony.. any others that make a good OOP framework for a new project?
[17:58:37] <jrockjiggz> front end: jquery / twitter bootstrap (or angular/backbone / twitter bootstrap).  maybe SASS, and something like YEOMAN
[18:01:31] <jrockjiggz> do you think a new web application should use PHP?
[18:03:42] <rmurphey> jrockjiggz: that is an unanswerable question
[18:03:51] <rmurphey> what's the project? what's the team? what's the existing stack?
[18:08:35] <jrockjiggz> rmurphey: friend seeking a web application/site to be developped.. has no idea, i'm trying to steer him in the right direction
[18:08:55] <jrockjiggz> https://www.freelancer.com/projects/PHP-Website-Design/Website-custom.html
[18:09:32] <jrockjiggz> i'm trying to prevent him going with a bid that isn't somewhat 'with it'
[18:09:41] <jrockjiggz> as in, uses jquery
[18:21:16] <rmurphey> jrockjiggz: no language will protect you from an incompetent dev
[18:21:47] <coldhead> well said, i can be incompetent in any language
[18:22:01] <rmurphey> i hear you're especially incompetent at php tho
[18:22:33] <rmurphey> also if the budget is $250 ...
[18:22:35] <rmurphey> good luck
[18:22:44] <jrockjiggz> thanks :)
[18:22:54] <coldhead> only because i can get my PHP to parse so my incomepetence can wreak actual havoc
[18:23:03] <tfevens> hey folks - I've got a question, which likely has a simple answer that I'm just overlooking...  anyone got a few min?
[18:23:10] <coldhead> my haskell incompetence never even compiles
[18:23:20] <rmurphey> how's that ruby working out for you coldhead
[18:23:35] <coldhead> OH SHIT I COMPLETELY FORGOT
[18:23:38] <coldhead> BRB LEARNING RUBY
[18:23:50] <coldhead> getting an entire set of keys replaced is a fulltime job
[18:24:12] <rmurphey> tfevens: ?ask
[18:24:19] <rmurphey> er
[18:24:22] <jrockjiggz> stupid windows, as I restart before a metting it decided todo updates.. while I have all my code
[18:24:24] <rmurphey> ?ask @ tfevens

[18:26:43] <tfevens> I'm succesfully creating a form and populating a select input. Using .on() I'm able to submit the second form, via ajax, and get results... trouble is, it's only submitting the form on the 2nd click - any thoughts?
[18:27:10] <rmurphey> ?demo @ tfevens
[18:27:11] <b-ot> tfevens: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:27:11] <bot-t> tfevens, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:27:11] <tfevens> http://pastebin.com/ha7BXiVt
[18:27:29] <tfevens> that's the JS anyway
[18:28:13] <tfevens> just local at the moment, and uses a third party API...  not sure jsfiddle would be able to handle it
[18:28:40] <coldhead> i think you want the ajaxForm() call inside your submit() to occur somewhere else
[18:28:52] <coldhead> possibly at the point where you are adding additional form fields
[18:29:11] <coldhead> because what you have now isn't going to add that ajaxForm functionality until you submit
[18:29:16] <coldhead> as you described
[18:29:38] <rmurphey> what coldhead said
[18:29:58] <tfevens> would adding it in the success callback of the first form make sense?
[18:30:46] <coldhead> sure, tfevens
[18:30:52] <coldhead> that sounds like a good thing to try
[18:31:22] <tfevens> bam, working like a charm
[18:31:40] <coldhead> huzzah
[18:31:47] <tfevens> well, at least I was right about it being a simple answer  ;-)
[18:32:00] <tfevens> thanks!!
[18:32:49] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life, tfevens
[18:33:44] <tfevens> and to you as well
[18:34:21] <coldhead> i fear i don't have long to live
[18:34:23] <coldhead> but thanks
[18:37:24] <tfevens> well, make the best of what you have left...
[18:37:30] <coldhead> good advice
[18:37:35] <tfevens> more erlang and less ruby though
[18:37:48] <coldhead> ew erlang is gross
[18:37:52] <tfevens> :-)
[18:37:56] <coldhead> it's as ugly as prolog
[18:38:28] <tfevens> I'll be honest... I've never even seen it... I'm just talking senseless
[18:38:50] <coldhead> brutal
[18:41:55] <tylercipriani>  /join #httpd
[18:59:21] <codepython777> anyone using wrtc here?
[19:14:49] <snkcld> when i attempt a post, I get back "Access to restricted URI denied". What do i need to set in jquery to white list the URI?
[19:15:57] <crashley> Using AJAX?
[19:16:09] <snkcld> yes
[19:16:47] <snkcld> crashley, also, the source URI is an IP address, if that matters
[19:17:01] <crashley> You will have to whitelist it on your server
[19:17:06] <crashley> Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[19:17:19] <crashley> 1 moment
[19:18:03] <crashley> Try adding this to the .htaccess on the server you are loading from
[19:18:04] <snkcld> crashley, i have this set. and i can confirm that it is set correctly because i can do a GET and get back data with no problem
[19:18:11] <crashley> Oh no
[19:18:14] <crashley> Well that was my solution :(
[19:18:18] <snkcld> >_<
[19:18:25] <crashley> <IfModule mod_headers.c>
[19:18:25] <crashley>     Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
[19:18:25] <crashley>   </IfModule>
[19:18:31] <crashley> Solved it for me in the htaccess
[19:18:51] <snkcld> solves the inability to POST?
[19:19:19] <Kimse> Hi
[19:19:44] <crashley> Hmm
[19:19:53] <Kimse> Anyone got an example of how to reset elements that matches :input to their default state?
[19:20:28] <Kimse> i wanna do what reset() does for a form, but only for fields inside a specific div
[19:27:43] <jasonthesensei> try to learn jQuery but i am having problems getting the value of input field i'm trying this var newItems = $('input#items').val(); console.log(newItems); but its not working can anyone help
[19:28:01] <jasonthesensei> heres the actual code:
[19:30:16] <jasonthesensei> $('a.btn).click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('input#items').val(); console.log(newItems) });
[19:31:43] <Eviltwin> So... you're not setting newItems to anything?
[19:31:57] <Eviltwin> "$('input#items').val();" by itself has no effect
[19:34:15] <Eviltwin> A true sensei would know this
[19:36:26] <jasonthesensei> after user input im entering data in the text field but its coming back as undefined
[19:37:20] <jasonthesensei> If i were teaching jQuery instead of martial arts of course i would
[19:38:49] <jasonthesensei> and a genius such as yourself should assume by the click event handler that i would require input in order to need to click to continue
[19:39:40] <jasonthesensei> but thanks anyway fixed it
[19:44:16] <coldhead> how rude
[19:45:39] <angelazou> hi guys, I need to modify a link here http://www.mychinaroots.com/
[19:45:56] <angelazou> if you use the left right key to move to beijing and click view detail
[19:46:17] <angelazou> actually any of the posts and click view detail, you will notice that it doesn't do anything
[19:46:38] <angelazou> I have chosen to console.log the clicked element
[19:47:52] <angelazou> but the console log shows up at least a dozen elements
[19:48:29] <angelazou> even though they seem to be the correct elements
[19:48:42] <angelazou> I don't really understand why markerLink.click would fail
[19:52:05] <coldhead> probably some kind of bug?
[19:54:27] <Eviltwin> You should file a bug with jQuery. It's probably jQuery's fault.
[20:11:18] <omg|its|otr> I have a div class summary, but it's got a div class grid within it. I want to have an .summary onclick function, but the inner div seems to be "blocking" some of my clicks. Is there a selector that is "This div, or any of its children that get in the way?"
[20:16:39] <tylercipriani> omg|its|otr: do you have a page we can look at?
[20:16:54] <omg|its|otr> Sorry yeah.
[20:16:56] <omg|its|otr> http://depotwarehouse.net/diplomacy/#current
[20:17:13] <omg|its|otr> If you click on the summary bubble above or below the text it extends as expected
[20:17:25] <omg|its|otr> If you click in line with the text, where the pure grid is, it does not
[20:17:27] <omg|its|otr> Thanks tylercipriani
[20:21:44] <relipse> is get(0) better than [0]
[20:22:28] <coldhead> it depends
[20:22:37] <coldhead> get(0) takes more typing
[20:22:41] <coldhead> and increase the filesize
[20:22:45] <relipse> lol
[20:22:51] <relipse> seriously
[20:22:54] <coldhead> but if you get paid per byte then you want the longer one
[20:24:19] <omg|its|otr> coldhead, is neglecting that [0] looks more complex than get(0). If you're picking up chicks at parties you're going to want to use [0] because then you're like a super mad hacker, yo.
[20:27:43] <coldhead> girls who are impressed by that are probably not worth the effort you put into the guacamole you made for the party
[20:28:14] <abjorn> :o
[20:28:18] <Curiousity> Hi ^^; I heard you come in here for support/help?
[20:28:56] <coldhead> in theory you can, Curiousity
[20:29:05] <coldhead> in practice it's just mostly people asking if they can ask here
[20:29:27] <Curiousity> oh. Well, umm... I have an odd issue. See, everything works...but for some reason while loading, the load image doesn't show up.
[20:29:38] <Curiousity> It used to show up--the link is all correct too, but it just...doesn't show up anymore
[20:30:04] <coldhead> it's working fine in my imagination
[20:30:09] <coldhead> do you have a demo somewhere?
[20:30:29] <Curiousity> http://pinkwaters.crystal-dreams.us Clicking the tabs on top of the right side of the layout bring up the box.
[20:30:58] <Curiousity> We didn't use a plugin and installed it through some of the tutorials floating around for jquery which is why I'm here instead of asking on like a plugin site or something.
[20:31:33] <tylercipriani> omg|its|otr: try $(this).children('.extend');
[20:32:23] <omg|its|otr> tylercipriani, It worked, I love you
[20:32:24] <omg|its|otr> thanks
[20:32:52] <wilornel> Hey guys, what if you edit a $(body).html(); is it normal that $(document).ready triggers?
[20:40:57] <wilornel> Anybody ?
[20:52:32] <Curiousity> ^^;;
[20:54:21] <r_user> hello, I've been studying jQuery and I noticed it won't work on firefox, is their something I need to do
[20:55:06] <HEMI> Check Firefox console to see *why* it's not running on Firefox?
[20:56:53] <Eviltwin> I heard jQuery wasn't designed to work in Firefox
[20:57:16] <HEMI> ...
[20:57:23] <HEMI> heheh.
[20:59:13] <Curiousity> update: The loading image shows in Firefox, but not Google Chrome. Ironically. @-@
[22:11:47] <Abhijit> hi. this is my json http://paste.ubuntu.com/5731583/ i am trying to access its array element by this loop http://paste.opensuse.org/86401245 but it fails. help please
[22:12:52] <Cork> Abhijit: you can't use this in line 24
[22:12:58] <Cork> use evt.id
[22:13:40] <Abhijit> Cork, changed. not working
[22:14:02] <Cork> Abhijit: also you have a long list of global variables at the top, that is a bad idea
[22:14:42] <Cork> also tmp["name"] won't work
[22:14:52] <Cork> tmp is an array, not an object
[22:15:00] <Abhijit> ok
[22:15:13] <Abhijit> Cork, tmp.id.name is also not working
[22:15:18] <Cork> it should be evt.name
[22:16:03] <Josh_> So, I am adding some tabs at runtime
[22:16:11] <Josh_> in JQuery UI Tabs.
[22:16:18] <Josh_> But, I got a little problem
[22:16:25] <Josh_> I'll link you to the page.
[22:16:45] <Abhijit> Cork, evt.name works but it gives name of only firrst array element by default. its not going to next array element
[22:16:51] <Josh_> If anyone is interested, I can pm them the link, I wont paste it in channel, sorry :\
[22:17:03] <Josh_> Mostly because it has my ip.
[22:17:36] <Cork> Abhijit: ah you have the same problem on line 20
[22:17:49] <Cork> eh...
[22:17:56] <Cork> man theres so many problems...
[22:18:08] <Josh_> Cork, You wish to see the problem?
[22:19:07] <Abhijit> Cork, changed it to $.each(json, function(j,evt1) {$.each(evt1,function(i,evt) still gives name if first array element only
[22:19:16] <Abhijit> of*
[22:19:21] <Cork> Abhijit: http://jsfiddle.net/t6E2G/
[22:20:30] <Cork> actually http://jsfiddle.net/t6E2G/1/
[22:20:46] <Abhijit> ok
[22:23:56] <Cork> ?ask @ Josh_
[22:23:56] <b-ot> Josh_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[22:24:05] <Josh_> Cork, I already asked it.
[22:24:07] <Josh_> Read above.
[22:24:15] <bobbobbins> hey, i need to make a full page width image carousel…anyone know a good jquery plugin for that?
[22:24:16] <Josh_> If its ok to paste a link in your pm
[22:24:18] <Josh_> I will.
[22:24:20] <Josh_> Else I wont.
[22:24:54] <Josh_> I just want to paste my own HTTP server's link thats it.
[22:26:27] <relipse> is $('<input/>')[0]; the jquery way of doing document.createElement('input');
[22:27:16] <Josh_> In JQuery Tab UI... If I add 2+ tabs, I can't basically click them and make them work.
[22:28:05] <coldhead> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/nM73C/
[22:30:22] <Cork> relipse: yes
[22:30:53] <Cork> relipse: well actually it's $.parseHTML('<input>')
[22:31:02] <relipse> parseHTML?
[22:31:05] <relipse> never heard of that
[22:31:12] <Cork> `api jquery.parseHTML
[22:31:13] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[22:31:16] <Cork> ?jquery.parseHTML
[22:31:17] <relipse> lol
[22:31:19] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery.parseHTML() | jQuery API Documentation - Parses a string into an array of DOM nodes. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseHTML/
[22:31:23] <Cork> stupid bots...
[22:31:50] <relipse> i dont understand everyone else i know uses $('<div />')
[22:31:56] <relipse> why use parseHTML?
[22:32:09] <Cork> relipse: $() uses $.parseHTML internally
[22:32:21] <relipse> so parseHTML is slightly faster?
[22:32:25] <Cork> and $() currently has some bugs that might cause it to fail
[22:32:44] <Cork> relipse: eh, ya, but not to a meaningful extent
[22:32:58] <Cork> relipse: if you really want speed just use document.createElement
[22:33:15] <relipse> because jquery's parseHTML will do that anyway?
[22:33:20] <relipse> i want agility
[22:33:21] <relipse> lol
[22:33:34] <Cork> no parseHTML will use fragments
[22:34:20] <Cork> hmm actually i haven't checked if the $() overlay is doing the createElement shortcut or if it's parseHTML doing it
[22:34:22] * Cork checks
[22:34:50] <relipse> how do i set a bunch of attributes at once again?
[22:34:51] <coldhead> Cork: i think the latest point release fixed $('  <notbroken>')
[22:34:53] <relipse> coldhead knows
[22:34:53] <Cork> ok, so ya .parseHTML will use document.createElement
[22:35:02] <coldhead> .attr({ foo: bar, aids: lol })
[22:35:10] <relipse> coldhead: what the heck <notbroken>???
[22:35:14] <Cork> coldhead: nice
[22:35:20] <coldhead> ignore the tagname, relipse
[22:35:26] <coldhead> i was talking aboot the leading spaces
[22:35:26] <relipse> coldhead: thanks
[22:35:30] <relipse> oh i see
[22:35:35] <Cork> relipse: earlier 1.9 versions couldn't handle '   <div></div>'
[22:36:25] <Cork> which was kinda silly
[22:38:33] <relipse> what is the appendChild jquery equivalent?
[22:38:40] <relipse> .append()
[22:38:41] <relipse> nm
[22:38:55] <Cork> yes
[22:39:22] <noaXess> good morning
[22:39:30] <Cork> or appendTo if you want to revert the relation
[22:39:47] <relipse> can you guys tell me if these 2 blocks are equivalent: https://pastee.org/dhe3q
[22:39:55] <relipse> (other than the word "sub"
[22:40:19] <noaXess> i need to upgrade a suggestSearch from a customer with uses autocomplete.. i saw that .data() is the problem but can't figure out what really to change, that code is running with new jquery, here is the code to upgrade: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5731629/
[22:40:23] <noaXess> any hint willb e nice
[22:40:26] <relipse> i think i'm going to use .appendTo
[22:40:36] <Cork> relipse: no value: subcat <--
[22:40:44] <noaXess> this code gives this error: TypeError: $autocomplete.data(...) is undefined
[22:40:56] <relipse> Cork: what?
[22:41:07] <Cork> relipse: no value: subcat vs setAttribute('value',cat);
[22:41:32] <relipse> i said ignorning the word 'sub'
[22:41:41] <Cork> ah, missed that
[22:41:43] <Cork> then yes
[22:42:06] <matt_kula> hello there
[22:42:20] <matt_kula> can somebody help me with a small problem I am having?
[22:42:38] <relipse> https://pastee.org/crarn <-- is this better Cork,coldhead
[22:42:48] <matt_kula> hello?
[22:43:00] <relipse> paste your problem
[22:43:03] <relipse> and someone may help you
[22:43:06] <relipse> probably coldhead
[22:43:07] <Cork> relipse: heh ya, it was exactly what i was about to paste :)
[22:43:18] <relipse> looks friendlier anyway
[22:43:32] <Cork> relipse: actually https://pastee.org/94pqw
[22:43:41] <Cork> just saw that it wasn't exactly the same
[22:43:46] <coldhead> guys i can't help with any problems, i am having a nosebleed
[22:43:59] <relipse> oh i see, you arent adding a $() to the div
[22:44:02] <Cork> ya
[22:44:10] <matt_kula> So on my website mattkula.com, I am using the slideDown but it seems to jump at the end. Can you guys help me find the div or whatever causing the problem?
[22:44:40] <b1lly> whats jumping dowb
[22:44:58] <b1lly> what browser
[22:45:05] <matt_kula> When pressing the links, the content slides down. Internet explorer and chrome
[22:45:09] <Cork> relipse: also not sure if you prefer name: 'transactions[' + [action, aid, 'subcategory'].join('][') + ']',
[22:45:15] <Cork> relipse: but i find it easier to read
[22:45:25] <b1lly> matt_kula: i'm looking at chrome
[22:45:30] <b1lly> and I don't see a problem?
[22:45:36] <matt_kula> Hmmm.
[22:45:49] <relipse> why use .join ?
[22:46:00] <relipse> lol no its ok as is + +
[22:46:02] <matt_kula> To me in chrome it appears smooth until the last like 1/4th, then it just jumps down
[22:46:15] <Cork> relipse: it takes the [][] craft out of the variable list
[22:46:22] <matt_kula> Only when you press home and work
[22:46:29] <relipse> cork: ok thanks
[22:47:28] <b1lly> matt_kula: I think your seeing a performance issue
[22:47:32] <Cork> matt_kula: are you using display: none; to hide the element through css?
[22:48:29] <Cork> ah, no
[22:48:47] <b1lly> Cork:  he is
[22:48:52] <b1lly> but why is that problematic
[22:49:10] <Cork> cause jquery depends on .hide()
[22:49:34] <Cork> else it doesn't know the display type it's working with, and animations fail sporadically
[22:50:01] <matt_kula> how would you solve that?
[22:50:04] <Cork> (it also means that ppl with js disabled can't read the page, and thats another bad part)
[22:50:14] <Cork> set the correct display: value
[22:50:24] <Cork> and on .ready run $('elements').hide()
[22:50:25] <Ramon_Bautista> does anyone still disable their js??
[22:50:28] <Cork> that should be all
[22:50:39] <Cork> Ramon_Bautista: i do, for one :)
[22:50:44] <Cork> and yes many do
[22:51:00] <Cork> Ramon_Bautista: not for the entire browser, but they enable it selectively

[22:51:30] <Cork> (those two arn't related btw)
[22:52:03] <matt_kula> what would the correct value for display be if I want them to be hidden?
[22:52:20] <Cork> that's the point you shouldn't hide it in the css
[22:52:23] <Cork> like i said
[22:52:54] <matt_kula> then what's the best way?
[22:53:04] <beg> >>> $(".tbl_courses_courselength")[0]
[22:53:04] <beg> <td class="tbl_courses_courselength" value="100">100</td>
[22:53:12] <tw2113> craft an experience for people who live miserably without js enabled
[22:53:16] <beg> How would I get the value from it?
[22:53:30] <Cork> matt_kula: read what i typed less then 2 mins ago
[22:53:43] <matt_kula> Ohhh I see
[22:53:46] <Cork> uh ok 4 mins :P
[22:53:53] <tw2113> is "value" a valid attribute for td ?
[22:54:14] <Cork> beg: to start with by creating a valid html string
[22:54:32] <tw2113> doesn't look like it from mdn
[22:54:36] <Cork> it isn't
[22:54:55] <Cork> beg: prefix custom attributes with data-
[22:55:03] <tw2113> i'm winning with Cork, it's a good night
[22:55:43] * tw2113 makes "you're going down" motions at that n00bsauce coldhead 
[23:22:08] <tw2113> jk coldhead... Cork & I <3 you
[23:22:44] <Cork> O_o what's with all the affection?
[23:22:45] <coldhead> open up your open up your open your throat
[23:22:59] <coldhead> i think he's been drinking, Cork
[23:23:01] <tw2113> just trying to get us in trouble
[23:23:11] <Cork> heh
[23:24:41] <coldhead> whoo
[23:32:28] <coldhead> sometimes i wish for the long way home
[23:58:05] <SomeoneWeird> Does anyone know any good jquery "timeline" libraries? I really like http://timeline.verite.co/ but I need it to have events that I can listen for so I can externally set stuff, any ideas?
