[00:03:49] <diverdude> How do i invoke a timer in jquery?
[00:06:09] <Zerpy> hey guys, if I have created a little script with jquery, that target a checkbox to see if it's checked or not, and then change color of the parent element if it's checked, how can I make a "fading effect" for that in jquery? my following code is like this: http://pastebin.com/Wv4jkabM
[00:27:41] <chrisvtx1> have you tried to append .fadeIn()
[00:27:45] <chrisvtx1> ?
[00:27:47] <diverdude> if nodes are added end removed etc. in javascript as a consequence of user interactions, how do i see the current DOM? In firebug it seems it only shows the DOM as it was at load-time.
[00:28:52] <cypha> what's this error about? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl/issues/52
[00:28:52] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #52 on jquery-tmpl, reported by pagles (8m, 1w ago): Template composition fails with compiled templates using the jQuery.template( name, template ) method
[00:28:57] <cypha> i keep getting it with my script
[00:30:41] <chrisvtx1> diverdude: what firebug panel are you looking at when you try to view these new dom elements?
[00:30:56] <chrisvtx1> i never have a problem viewing dom elements created on the fly
[00:31:10] <Zerpy> chrisvtx1: How do I do that :s
[00:31:41] <diverdude> chrisinajar, HTML
[00:32:34] <chrisvtx1> Zerpy: in the HTML tab within firebug
[00:32:45] <Zerpy> yeah
[00:33:04] <chrisvtx1> open firebug, invoke an event with your mouse, watch the dom elements change
[00:33:29] <chrisvtx1> diverdude: and are you sure your code fires when the events are triggered?
[00:34:10] <chrisvtx1> when i add a dom element using ajax or another jqery method, firebug will highlight the new dom elements in yellow
[00:34:23] <chrisvtx1> and then show the updated content within the HTML tab
[00:35:23] <Zerpy> but chrisvtx1: How can I add the .fadeIn() function to that elemnet :o
[00:35:52] <diverdude> chrisinajar, ok, my bad
[00:38:40] <diverdude> wauw...firebug is impressive
[00:39:08] <chrisvtx1> Zerpy: i have not tested this, but try
[00:40:04] <Zerpy> that I want, is that when I click the checkbox, a class appends to the parent element, but I want the new color to fadeIn / Animate, so it just just change, but it fades.. yeah :S
[00:40:15] <chrisvtx1> $(this).parent().toggleClass('checked', 1500);
[00:40:52] <chrisvtx1> diverdude: yes, firebug definitely makes web dev manageable
[00:41:12] <chrisvtx1> i remember coding css with no tools like firebug.  it was a nightmare
[00:42:18] <diverdude> chrisinajar, yeah...i had an error i could not understand just now...but with the help of firebug i found out in less than 1 minute
[00:42:46] <chrisvtx1> sure
[00:43:12] <Zerpy> chrisvtx1: doesn't work :S
[00:43:13] <chrisvtx1> yes, you will see the error on the bottom right in firebug.  just look in the console to see the exact problem.
[00:43:54] <chrisvtx1> firebug will always show the "state" of the dom as events fire in the browser.
[00:44:13] <chrisvtx1> Zerpy: did you try to do the fadeIn() instead?
[00:44:33] <Zerpy> yeah
[00:45:54] <diverdude> if im doing: parent.append($('<input type="text"/>')); How do i add a change() event to that textbox?
[00:46:30] <diverdude> nvm
[00:46:35] <diverdude> ihave an idea
[00:46:37] <diverdude> :)
[00:47:18] <chrisvtx1> Zerpy, can you put the html up with the js so i can see what you are doing?
[00:49:22] <Zerpy> http://pastebin.com/Giw92nMY there you go.. When clicking the checkbox, the parent (label) should switch from red to green, animated
[00:53:05] <chrisvtx1> Zerpy: firebug shows an error...the "$" is not defined
[00:53:31] <diverdude> how do react on the event "textfield is changed" change() seems to only fire on blur actually
[00:53:32] <Zerpy> if it wasn't defined, it shouldn't even be able to switch the colors :P
[00:53:36] <chrisvtx1> you probably want to load that with document ready
[00:54:16] <chrisvtx1> i'm not able to switch colors by clicking on the checkbox
[00:54:40] <chrisvtx1> never mind
[00:54:42] <chrisvtx1> i have it now
[00:54:44] <chrisvtx1> --
[00:55:02] <chrisvtx1> your jquery resource link was blocked by my server
[00:55:06] <diverdude> keypress() is almost what i want, but this event does not fire if user paste a value with the mouse?
[00:55:30] <Zerpy> lolz, ur server is blocking a cdn network then :o
[00:59:32] <chrisvtx1> yes, i have sensitive data on it
[00:59:59] <chrisvtx1> we are going to need the .animate method to solve your problem
[01:00:00] <chrisvtx1> http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[01:01:15] <Zerpy> I tried doing $(this).parent().animate({backgroundColor: 'yellow'}, 1000); but doesn't seem to work :S
[01:02:19] <chrisvtx1> do you have the jquery ui javascript?
[01:02:23] <Zerpy> :$
[01:02:39] <chrisvtx1> need to include jquery.ui
[01:03:46] <chrisvtx1> i got it to work
[01:03:48] <chrisvtx1> prefectly
[01:03:48] <chrisvtx1> now
[01:04:02] <chrisvtx1>     <script src="http://cdn.hosting4real.com/js/jquery.js"></script>

[01:04:03] <chrisvtx1>             //$(this).parent().addClass("checked");
[01:04:04] <chrisvtx1> 				$(this).parent().animate({backgroundColor: 'lightgreen'}, 'slow');
[01:04:04] <chrisvtx1>         } else {
[01:04:05] <chrisvtx1>             $(this).parent().removeClass("checked");
[01:04:05] <chrisvtx1>         }
[01:04:06] <chrisvtx1>     });
[01:04:06] <chrisvtx1> 	
[01:04:07] <chrisvtx1>     </script>
[01:06:15] <cypha> can anyone explain the error seen when selecting a file? http://68.198.22.26:8000/test
[01:07:36] <Zerpy> Chrisvtx1: if I then, click it again, then it should go back to the red color :o, in the else I did same animation, just changing color to red again :S
[01:07:51] <Hierofant> cypha I get no error
[01:08:16] <cypha> Hierofant, after selecting the file, check your firebug Console
[01:08:28] <Hierofant> yeah nothing.
[01:08:34] <chrisvtx1> Zerpy: just change it back to red in the "else" block
[01:08:43] <MyNameisUser> can someone help me with reading $.post variables in PHP ? :(
[01:08:52] <Hierofant> Console -> all -> [blankd]
[01:08:53] <chrisvtx1> $(this).parent().animate({backgroundColor: 'red'}, 'slow');
[01:08:56] <cypha> Hierofant, everyone's seen the error with both ff and chrome so far! :)
[01:09:01] <cypha> ur the only one not seeing an error
[01:09:03] <Hierofant> well okay
[01:09:09] <Hierofant> THEN ITS FIXED
[01:09:11] <Hierofant> YOU ARE DONE
[01:09:14] <cypha> haha
[01:09:19] <chrisvtx1> cypha, i see no error
[01:09:31] <cypha> chrisvtx1, did you browse to select a file?
[01:09:35] <Hierofant> cypha - I did shift-reload and there was an error for a second
[01:09:37] <chrisvtx1> yes
[01:09:43] <Hierofant> then it disappeared like ajax
[01:09:48] <chrisvtx1> and i didn't notice anything in firebug
[01:09:51] <Zerpy> christvtx1: I do like this: http://pastebin.com/MSmX7b1q - and ain't changing back :S
[01:09:58] <cypha> there should be an error in fb console
[01:10:13] <Hierofant> cypha -  "Reload to activ ate window console"
[01:10:22] <cypha> ya
[01:10:45] <Hierofant> OKay I got the error
[01:10:50] <Hierofant> its huge
[01:10:56] <cypha> ya
[01:11:22] <chrisvtx1> i click "browse" i see my image file path in the text input box
[01:11:25] <chrisvtx1> then that's it
[01:11:31] <Hierofant> http://pastebin.com/H0VcaVmA
[01:11:42] <Hierofant> thats the error I get
[01:12:04] <cypha> yup
[01:12:15] <Hierofant> cypha are you working with a template that you didn't author?
[01:12:23] <cypha> no
[01:12:31] <chrisvtx1> sorry, can't help with this one
[01:12:34] <Hierofant> whats your question then?
[01:12:53] <cypha> but i didn't author jquery.tmpl
[01:13:04] <cypha> jquery.tmpl.js
[01:13:21] <cypha> chrisvtx1, maybe reload console
[01:13:26] <cypha> the error is definitely there
[01:13:28] <cypha> 100% of the time
[01:13:33] <Hierofant> jQuery.tmpl( template, [data,] [options] ) Returns: jQuery
[01:13:33] <Hierofant> Description: Render the specified HTML content as a template, using the specified data.
[01:13:35] <chrisvtx1> i did that
[01:13:46] <Hierofant> ?tmpl @cypha
[01:13:49] <Hierofant> ?tmpl @ cypha
[01:13:56] <Hierofant> ?.tmpl
[01:13:59] <Hierofant> ?.tmpl()
[01:14:06] <Hierofant> shit,   bot
[01:14:35] <Hierofant> cypha well, looks like you're using a template after all
[01:14:45] <Hierofant> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[01:15:44] <cypha> oh
[01:15:53] <Hierofant> oh?
[01:15:55] <cypha> Hierofant, what template are they referring to?
[01:16:00] <Hierofant> yeah it has .TMPL in the name
[01:16:10] <Hierofant> html
[01:16:10] <cypha> that's the name of the library
[01:16:52] <Hierofant> what's a library?
[01:16:56] <Hierofant> place with books?
[01:17:40] <Hierofant> maybe ask these people what this does:  <script src="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.templates/beta1/jquery.tmpl.min.js"></script>
[01:17:57] <Hierofant> someone at "aspnetcdn
[01:17:58] <cypha> ?
[01:18:10] <Hierofant> looks like they wrote it
[01:18:18] <cypha> someone on github asked the developer about the c.tmpl error
[01:18:37] <cypha> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl/issues/93
[01:18:37] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #93 on jquery-tmpl, reported by ericwebster (5m, 3w ago): Cannot use dynamic template name
[01:18:39] <Hierofant> cypha do you know what you're doing?
[01:18:44] <cypha> nope
[01:18:47] <Hierofant> yeah it shows
[01:18:49] <Gorkyman> hm... I want to create somekind of drawing board... anyone with an idea ?
[01:18:53] <Hierofant> tell others in the future
[01:19:05] <cypha> tell others that I dunno what I'm doing?
[01:19:06] <cypha> haha
[01:19:10] <diverdude> nice...i have a jquery chain of 9 elements :D
[01:19:20] <diverdude> i love chaining hehe
[01:19:41] <Hierofant> cypha ask smart questions.  http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:21:03] <cypha> Hierofant, relax
[01:21:09] <cypha> was definitely appreciating your help
[01:21:16] <cypha> till you realized i'm a js newb
[01:22:05] <Hierofant> cypha the error you are getting indicates that you are implementing basic shit incorrectly.
[01:22:20] <Hierofant> jquery is not in the habit of spitting out mile-long functions as its error stream
[01:22:37] <Hierofant> especially not minified ones, whic nobody can read or parse
[01:22:53] <Hierofant> not me, not the guy who leads jquery
[01:23:26] <Hierofant> and all your code thus far looks like ajax/server side function calls that are not available as source
[01:23:53] <Hierofant> and it looks like a blob you down loaded from somewhere that was a "fre upload files script" that you unzipped, ran out of the box, and cant decipher
[01:24:15] <Hierofant> which could also mean you don't have server permissions, or correct config somehow, files/folder,s paths, etc
[01:24:22] <Hierofant> none of which are jquery problems
[01:24:31] <Hierofant> they are specific to the TEMPLATE you are using
[01:24:41] <Hierofant> which is why the first thing I asked was, "are you using a template?"
[01:24:56] <Hierofant> because that effects the kind of diagnosis anyone can offer
[01:25:37] <Zerpy> there should be a site, where you could search for what you wanted in jquery UI, and it would tell u what parts of the UI u should have :P
[01:26:07] <Hierofant> Zerpy, make that site :D
[01:26:15] <Zerpy> I will :P
[01:26:20] <Hierofant> u could probably sell lots of advertising
[01:26:23] <cypha> Hierofant, this is the code: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[01:27:05] <cypha> and that's all I have
[01:27:18] <cypha> so why should here be any issue?
[01:27:49] <Hierofant> I dunno man, sorry
[01:28:05] <Hierofant> do you have an upload.php?
[01:28:16] <Zerpy> hierofant, I'm already on the way creating the site lol
[01:29:06] <cypha> i have /pic_upload
[01:29:53] <Hierofant> cypha it is saying c.tmpl is not a function.  So something isn't getting defined for that which should be.
[01:30:03] <Hierofant> thats what it seems like
[01:30:36] <Hierofant> so either c is missing
[01:30:52] <Hierofant> or the function wants some arguments which are missing?
[01:31:19] <Hierofant> c.tmpl("pic_upload", 2, jigsaw)
[01:31:31] <Hierofant> instead of c.tmpl() maybe, I am just guessing
[01:35:37] <Hierofant> What is "c"?
[01:36:08] <cypha> Hierofant, but I'm not supposed to edit the jquery.tmpl.min.js file, right?
[01:36:15] <Hierofant> nope
[01:36:20] <Hierofant> not typically
[01:36:22] <cypha> right
[01:36:31] <cypha> so I'm not sure where/how to provide the necessary arguments
[01:36:50] <Hierofant> me neither.  It must be AJAX, which I don't know
[01:38:29] <hExDJ> anyone using AnythingSlider?
[01:39:05] <Hierofant> cypha - "If uploading files doesn't work, make sure that the files and thumbnails directories permissions allow your server write access."
[01:39:12] <Hierofant> did you make sure of that?
[01:40:23] <cypha> i don't have a thumbnails directory setup
[01:40:31] <cypha> only the upload stuff server-side
[01:41:32] <Hierofant> okay well
[01:41:34] <Hierofant> read the manual
[01:54:02] <Gorkyman> hm... I'm thinking of creating a "line drawing"... onmousedown is the starting point, onmouseup is the end point... though I need to draw a line in between on mousemove live
[01:54:21] <Gorkyman> I was thinking maybe doing it with canvas? any other idea ?
[02:39:54] <wgo> Is there any way to get json out of the result of sortable? In the same way as you can "serialize" or "toArray"
[02:41:37] <bencc> is there a plugin to show a popup with buttons next to a button on click?
[02:42:31] <bencc> something like the ui datepicker but with only buttons
[02:50:36] <Dollz> I have block <span> with text inside block <a> when I set a click event on the <a> and click on white space of the span , the click is not triggered
[02:50:41] <Dollz> any solution for this ?
[02:52:15] <astropirate> Dollz, because you have the click event listening on the 'a' and not the 'span'?
[02:52:38] <Dollz> astropirate, the span is inside the <a>
[02:52:51] <Dollz> event capturing ?
[02:54:10] <Dollz> I've binded a click event as well on the span now with same handler
[02:54:15] <Dollz> no thing happens
[02:54:32] <ravenzz> is the span child of the anchor element?
[02:54:45] <Dollz> yes
[02:54:59] <Dollz> <a href="javascript:;" class="btn_white" style="position: absolute;top: 41px;left: 285px;"><span style="padding:0 10px">UPDATE</span></a>
[02:56:36] <Dollz> <Span> height is 23px , which is greater than the height of the 'update' word
[02:57:07] <Dollz> when I click anywhere above or below the word 'update' , event is not triggered
[02:57:40] <Dollz> but is triggered when I click on the word
[02:59:02] <Dollz> demo : http://firstconverter.com , then click on youtube on the sidebar , update button is in the middle
[03:03:58] <Dollz> back
[03:05:40] <Dollz> tried setting line-height:23px , didn't solve
[03:17:14] <Dollz> solved with mousedown event instead of click
[03:17:45] <Dollz> mouseup is not fired on the button when user clicks on the button
[03:17:55] <Dollz> becuase it moves to another place
[03:33:21] <Zerpy> will the last-child selector in CSS work in IE6,7,8 if using it via jquery like: $("#my_menu li:last-child").addClass("last");
[03:33:33] <dabear> Zerpy: yes
[03:33:49] <Zerpy> I love jquery
[03:33:50] <dabear> but it will be slower
[03:33:59] <Zerpy> I don't care :P
[03:34:19] <dabear> but your mom cares
[03:34:35] <RobertV> haha
[03:34:37] <Zerpy> yeah, and ur sister :p
[03:35:06] <coppa> hi there
[03:36:02] <dirtycockroach> coppa: hi
[03:41:47] <coppa> guys if you want to play around with a plugin I'm doing http://jquery-css.com/magic-jquery
[03:42:49] <coppa> theres layout features (position/align/limit elements) and UI features (menus/messages/popIn)
[04:14:56] <adtaylor> Does anyone know why `this.hFlag["el"] = myState;` does not preserve its state when `this.hFlag.el = myState;` does?
[04:21:34] <coppa> does not understand too much the question, both should be kindof same ..no ?
[04:23:21] <adtaylor> completely, I thought there was no difference ‚Äî¬†but the one does not preserve state change out of that function. I've never seen it before but wondered if it was something I just didn't know about
[04:33:51] <dabear> adtaylor: there is no difference; you must be PEBKACing
[04:35:39] <adtaylor> dabear : yep, pretty sure thats the case

[06:24:39] <sean`> zerok, .is (':checked')
[06:24:49] <sean`> .prop ('checked') === true
[06:24:56] <sean`> and there are  a lot more
[06:25:53] <Zerpy> http://pastebin.com/KZfWFTW6 having this, and it should check onload :S
[06:26:43] <sean`> that is very koole code
[06:26:52] <sean`> unfortunately it doesn't make any sense
[06:27:13] <Zerpy> Nope :P
[06:27:52] <sh_sh> pachet: thanks
[06:27:58] <sean`> $(function () { $('input:checkbox').each (function () { var $this = $(this); if ($this.is (':checked')) { animate the shit out of it } else { } }); });
[06:28:21] <dabear> how do you animate its shit?
[06:28:36] <dabear> $(this).animateShit() ?
[06:29:31] <sean`> is NEW HTML6!
[06:29:43] <sean`> window.requestShitFrame

[07:29:29] <deoxy000> does anyone have any experience with the following: Trying to enable some elements to be droppable after a draggable has started to be dragged....
[07:29:51] <imsky> you can find me in the club
[07:30:10] <deoxy000> my elements don't seem to accept it, can this theoretically be done? am i probably just doing it wrong?
[07:33:22] <deoxy000> http://jsfiddle.net/aT9ML/ ?
[07:37:03] <deoxy000> can be done, should have debugged more before resorting to asking! peace all
[07:37:26] <netytan> :) next dumb question. How does one prevent the focus from leaving an element?
[07:38:22] <tktiddle> Hi is there a selector for next sibling?
[07:38:43] <kborchers> ?next @ tktiddle
[07:38:43] <bot-t> tktiddle, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[07:41:32] <tktiddle> i just found .nextElementSibling is that a vanilla js thing?
[07:43:21] <Dave_Stein> tktiddle: node.nextSIbling
[07:43:24] <Dave_Stein> nextSibling
[07:44:37] <Dave_Stein> tktiddle: native may give back a textnode, however jquery would not
[07:44:49] <pachet> nextSibling selects comment nodes, i think

[07:49:50] <bencc> when creating a ui widget $.widget("my.tabs", {...}} I still need to call it with $('myid').tabs()
[07:50:03] <bencc> so how does the namespace my help?
[07:50:14] <bencc> is it possible to instantiate it differently?
[07:51:38] <Dave_Stein> bencc: doesn't it make it  trigger the events differently?
[07:51:50] <Dave_Stein> bencc: so you can bind to my.change instead of change?
[07:51:59] <netytan> Is there a way to stop tab selecting the addressbar?
[07:52:21] <Dave_Stein> netytan: not without stopping tab from working at all
[07:52:36] <netytan> :) Ok thanks
[07:53:03] <netytan> If I'd like tab to insert a tab character what would you recommend?
[07:53:52] <Dave_Stein> bind to the input field and on keyPress see the keycode, if its tab, event.preventDefault and add it into the inputs value
[07:53:59] <bencc> Dave_Stein: all I know that you still start the widget with $("myid").tabs() so jquery ui can't distinguish between my widget and the original widget ui.tabs
[07:54:44] <Dave_Stein> bencc: oh i misunderstood you before, why dont you rename it to mytabs if you're extending over tabs?
[07:55:27] <netytan> thanks
[07:55:27] <salomonv> hi, using the slidedown-function with text and images, the images go smooth but the text 'jumps' at the end, is there any way to circumvent that?
[07:55:54] <Dave_Stein> salomonv i've had that issue before ugh i can't remember how i fixed it offhand
[07:56:05] <Dave_Stein> salomonv: make a fiddle and i can take a look
[07:56:14] <salomonv> Dave_Stein: fiddle?
[07:56:29] <Dave_Stein> ?jsfiddle @ salomonv
[07:56:30] <bot-t> salomonv, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[07:57:00] <salomonv> Dave_Stein: thanks, will do that
[07:57:08] <bencc> Dave_Stein: so what's the point with the ui.mytabs if ui doesn't mean anything?
[07:57:32] <bencc> Dave_Stein: if mytabs() is the part that is accessible to the end user
[07:57:49] <salomonv> actually looking at it again the image is on the end position immediately and the text jumps... but i'll make a fiddle
[07:58:10] <Dave_Stein> id give you the answer but i think im reading it right now
[07:58:11] <Dave_Stein> bencc: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[07:58:33] <Dave_Stein> salomonv: its probably something having t odo with inline elements popping around when there's  space
[07:59:18] <Dave_Stein> bencc: so the namespace seems to be for storing it in the correct place in prototype, nothing to do with using .tabs() without overwriting it, if your plugin is named the same
[08:00:12] <bencc> Dave_Stein: why do I care where it stores it? let it store under ui. and give me a namespace with: $("myid").myns.tabs()
[08:00:27] <bencc> doesn't make any sense
[08:00:44] <bencc> you can have a new namesapce but it conflicts with the default namespace
[08:00:53] <pachet> Dave_Stein: i'm not there, work conflicta
[08:00:55] <pachet> *-a
[08:01:10] <Dave_Stein> bencc: namespacing the widget and naming it the same thing as another widget are two different things
[08:01:20] <Dave_Stein> pachet: so you're not spanish? ;)
[08:01:46] <Dave_Stein> bencc: you want to have control where new objects are living and that's what namespacing is for
[08:02:19] <bencc> Dave_Stein: so the namespace is attached to the element dom for using live() ?
[08:02:22] <pachet> no, pero puedo comprenderlo suficientamente para conversar
[08:02:28] <Dave_Stein> ugh i took french
[08:02:29] <Dave_Stein> :)
[08:02:53] <Dave_Stein> bencc: I THINK if a widget fires blah, it will also fire namespace.blah
[08:02:54] <bencc> Dave_Stein: even if that's the case, if you have a conflict with ui.tabs, it's useless and confusing
[08:02:57] <Dave_Stein> pachet: do you know for sure?
[08:04:00] <pachet> know what? i never know anything for sure :[
[08:04:21] <Dave_Stein> if you namespace a widget, does the event fire namespace.event AND event or am I making that up
[08:04:30] <bencc> who cares?
[08:04:36] <bencc> you still have to give it a unique name
[08:04:45] <Dave_Stein> because if .tabs() and .mytabs() fire change
[08:04:46] <bencc> so why can't use just call it mytabs and done with it
[08:04:52] <Dave_Stein> you want to make sure you are binding to the right one
[08:05:21] <Dave_Stein> but like i said im not sure, but i know thats why binds are dropstop instead of stop, for a droppable for instance
[08:05:42] <bencc> you bind to the widget not to the element so you know which one fired it
[08:06:04] <Dave_Stein> that's not true
[08:06:08] <Dave_Stein> $('#blah').draggable()
[08:06:12] <Dave_Stein> you then bind to $('#blah')
[08:06:21] <Dave_Stein> .draggable() returns your element
[08:07:04] <bencc> Dave_Stein:  that's not true. look at this page: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[08:07:15] <bencc> click on the Events tab on the bottom and see how it is used
[08:07:24] <bencc> $( ".selector" ).bind( "buttoncreate", function(event, ui)
[08:07:29] <bencc> no use of namespace
[08:08:00] <Dave_Stein> a) i was saying im unsure if you can bind to namespace in the way i was suggesting. b) they are binding to the element when using .bind
[08:08:18] <Dave_Stein> i was also saying that they do another kind of namespacing meaning its buttoncreate, not just create
[08:08:25] <Dave_Stein> unlike the coupled callback where its just create
[08:08:35] <Dave_Stein> the coupled callback goes to the widget and the uncoupled one goes to the element
[08:08:46] <Dave_Stein> uncoupled is always better to use anywho
[08:09:06] <bencc> do you see the namespace anywhere?
[08:09:07] <bencc> I don't
[08:09:59] <Dave_Stein> nope so i was unsure and its not there
[08:10:24] <Dave_Stein> but the namespace is definitely used on the elements
[08:10:26] <Dave_Stein> in widget:
[08:10:26] <Dave_Stein> widgetEventPrefix: $[ namespace ][ name ].prototype.widgetEventPrefix || name,
[08:10:33] <Dave_Stein> and then all the ui plugins use that
[08:10:47] <bencc> whatever
[08:11:13] <Dave_Stein> bencc: you can be upset about the way an open source thing is working but i don't see why you'd be. just name your plugin mytabs and everything works
[08:11:40] <salomonv> Dave_Stein: trying to create a fiddle but it works like a charm there...
[08:12:00] <Dave_Stein> salomonv: somethign is going on your site that isnt in the fiddle then
[08:13:20] <Dave_Stein> im off for now
[08:14:06] <bencc> Dave_Stein: another option - I won't use an open source project with a bad design
[08:17:03] <widoz> hei anyone help me about lavalamp? http://wido.altervista.org/test/demo.html the first position of background hover is not correct

[08:32:52] <Innocentus> hi
[08:33:16] <Innocentus> I would like to get the real width and height of a collapsed (by css width: 0; height: 0;) div
[08:33:32] <tktiddle> How can i get the value of an element's attributes?
[08:33:58] <tktiddle> e.g <tr data-num="1">
[08:34:13] <tktiddle> how do i get the value of data-num?

[08:36:19] <nmee> Hi, I'm pretty new to jQuery and want to use .live() to bind the click event of many links to a single function. What is the best/proper way of passing a parameter from the link to the function? (i.e. each link has some additional data I want to be available in the click event)
[08:36:46] <Innocentus> Lochlan: this will also work when the div / element has been collapsed by css?
[08:37:10] <Lochlan> try it and see, remember to use console.log
[08:37:25] <Lochlan> nmee, do you know how to pass a variable to a function?
[08:40:00] <nmee> Lochlan: sure, but let me elaborate:  I have used $('.my-link').live('click', function(){ ... }); for binding the event, but how can I put my own data in each link selected by the .my-link selector? I could possibly use e.g. <a myparam="123" class="my-link"...>, but this would break conformance to the html standard
[08:40:40] <Lochlan> you can use the html5 data attribute to store additional info
[08:41:05] <Lochlan> like what tktiddle was asking above
[08:41:24] <nmee> Lochlan: perfect, thanks, did not know about that :)
[08:42:20] <tktiddle> How can i append an element as the nextSibling to the current element?
[08:46:47] <Lochlan> .append() tktiddle?
[08:47:03] <Lochlan> or
[08:47:05] <Lochlan> oh
[08:47:08] <Lochlan> next to it
[08:47:10] <Lochlan> after() ?
[09:00:09] <tktiddle> How can i select all the siblings to an element?
[09:00:17] <K1ng`> how do i click() a button in iframe?
[09:00:34] <K1ng`> $("#iframe").find('#iframe_btn') returns null

[09:06:01] <guy> I am playing with a custom scrollbar here, but I am getting an issue, because $(function(){ $(window).resize(function(){  }).trigger('resize'); }); does not return correct height on initial page load.
[09:06:01] <guy> http://anuary.com/#!/blog
[09:06:15] <guy> however, if you try to resize the browser window, it will start to work.
[09:08:21] <K1ng`> guy, $(window).width()
[09:08:30] <guy> window width what?
[09:08:38] <K1ng`> $(window).height()
[09:08:43] <guy> ...
[09:08:45] <guy> what abou tit?
[09:08:47] <guy> it*
[09:09:07] <K1ng`> its will give you currect window size
[09:09:24] <guy> right..
[09:09:28] <guy> anyone else?
[09:11:38] <guy> ah! I found the problem. I was checking the element height before AJAX loaded.
[09:11:48] <cbobo> what is the best way to stream content to a webpage?

[09:14:24] <guy> cbobo: see Node.js and socket.io
[09:14:52] <guy> tomasm-: ajaxForm() is not native jquery framework function.

[10:17:31] <DualDetroit> If $("...")[0] bad form?
[10:19:53] <BinaryKitten> yes DualDetroit
[10:20:10] <BinaryKitten> since it's not actually retuning a jquery object
[10:20:25] <BinaryKitten> it returns the actual element
[10:20:44] <DualDetroit> BinaryKitten: But that's what I want.
[10:20:56] <DualDetroit> Is there a better way to get the actual element via the jQuery selector?
[10:21:11] <BinaryKitten> urm you want the native domNode?
[10:21:19] <BinaryKitten> or the single item from the selector?
[10:24:35] <DualDetroit> BinaryKitten: The native domNode I think
[10:25:03] <DualDetroit> So I have all of the garden variety .insertBefore(), .appendChild(), cloneNode(), etc.
[10:25:21] <BinaryKitten> they are jquery methods
[10:25:23] <BinaryKitten> arn't they?
[10:25:37] <BinaryKitten> or at least have equivelents
[10:27:17] <minond> DualDetroit: will you be reusing that element in your code?
[10:28:04] <ajpiano> DualDetroit: you use .get(index) or index the jquery object like an array $(".bar")[0]
[10:35:34] <DualDetroit> ajpiano: I an indexing the jquery ike an array currently.
[10:35:38] <DualDetroit> *like
[10:38:41] <ck> so i'm reading the docs on .delegate() and i want to make sure i understand something said. From the API:
[10:38:42] <ck> Since the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events. Similarly, events handled by .delegate() will propagate to the elements to which they are delegated; event handlers bound on any elements below it in the DOM tree will already have been executed by the time the delegated event handler is called.
[10:38:42] <ck> These handlers, therefore, may prevent the delegated handler from triggering by calling event.stopPropagation() or returning false.
[10:40:05] <ck> Is this saying that if I do something like $(body).delegate('a', 'click', function(){}); that all the other events in the child elements will fire before the click event on the <a> will fire?

[11:28:34] <pachet> too much recursion @ 7206 :O
[11:29:12] <eddiemonge> wtf are you trying to do?
[11:29:51] <eddiemonge> did you try to use what i just wrote in some actual code?
[11:30:33] <snover> a function that calls itself unconditionally every time causes infinite recursion? no way!
[11:31:13] <pachet> was just surprised it took that many loops ;o
[11:33:12] <eddiemonge> im confused by what you are trying to accomplish

[12:25:42] <bullines> Are there any benefits in loading jQuery in the document's HEAD rather than the end of the BODY?
[12:31:27] <Jayflux> bullines it depends what scripts you are going to run, if half of them rely on jQuery or you would like to visually change something before pageload you should keep it in the head really.
[12:38:28] <cbobo> How can I get the height of an iframe?

[12:41:08] <maximedt> someone can help me pls ?
[12:41:18] <gar_onn> is it the class H4 ?
[12:41:30] <maximedt> <h4 class="h4">
[12:41:32] <richardr> Are there any jQuery libraries that can help me (AJAX) navigate down *very* large category trees. Each category has a id, parent_id, name. For example; click highest level, ajax call, children are displayed. Categories, nesting levels, etc are all arbitrary

[12:41:46] <maximedt> i have this

[12:42:53] <diverdude> Jayflux, are there any performance gains by keeping in jquery in the head?
[12:42:54] <gar_onn> and next('p') ?
[12:43:11] <gar_onn> diverdude, nope
[12:43:26] <gar_onn> it will stop the bvrowser from parseing HTML
[12:43:31] <gar_onn> *browser
[12:43:59] <Jayflux> diverdude nope but if you have other scripts using it obv you should load it first
[12:44:08] <maximedt> it doesn't work too gar_onn
[12:44:15] <diverdude> Jayflux, ah, yeah ok
[12:45:08] <gar_onn> maximedt, got a fiddle?
[12:45:48] <maximedt> i don't understand (i'm not english) sorry
[12:46:01] <maximedt> what is a fiddle?
[12:46:09] <ale_-_> Hello, how can I send textarea values thorugh $.ajax?
[12:46:17] <ale_-_> it has some line breaks
[12:46:31] <maximedt> ale_-_ "\n"
[12:46:40] <ale_-_> But how?
[12:46:43] <diverdude> ale_-_, you can do anything you want
[12:47:34] <ale_-_> but it's not being sent
[12:48:09] <ale_-_> Just the last line is being sent
[12:48:12] <ale_-_> diverdude
[12:48:47] <diverdude> you could urlencode it
[12:51:40] <maximedt> http://jsfiddle.net/78MK2/1/

[12:55:56] <petermanser> hey there. is there an event like "added" or "changed" so if I add new "div.foobar" elements, it gets triggered?
[12:56:50] <maximedt> yes gar_onn
[12:56:54] <maximedt> that seems strange
[12:57:10] <maximedt> i can't delete pre
[12:57:25] <maximedt> in fact i have <pre><xmp>
[12:57:30] <maximedt> after <p>
[13:02:39] <eddiemonge> petermanser: just do what ever it is you want to happen in the function that adds the stuff
[13:02:56] <gar_onn> esd≥
[13:04:17] <eddiemonge> maximedt: pre tags don't go into paragraph thags. inspect the element in console and you will see
[13:05:54] <maximedt> how I can fix this?
[13:06:30] <maximedt> i have no error in my conseil
[13:06:33] <maximedt> console

[13:08:12] <maximedt> working with $(this).next("pre").hide();
[13:08:15] <maximedt> and no <p> tags
[13:08:21] <maximedt> can I do
[13:08:25] <maximedt> $(this).next("pre, p").hide();

[13:10:39] <sean`> dotwired, you can use that on your a tags, see if the href tags match an extension of jpg,png etc.
[13:10:50] <sean`> Or use .filter and do it yourself
[13:10:52] <eddiemonge> dotwired: really? seems like it could be inefficient to do that. there isny a better way to select the links? like with a class or something?
[13:11:28] <sean`> ^^ that too
[13:12:17] <petermanser> eddiemonge‚Ä¶ well this isn't a very nice way, imo.
[13:12:18] <dotwired> hmm okay‚Ä¶ :) thanks =)
[13:12:51] <petermanser> if I want to remove this "feature" once, I've to scan all my code? Otherwise, removing some lines of code are enough.
[13:16:12] <eddiemonge> petermanser: huh?
[13:16:56] <petermanser> eddiemonge: I've three options/functions where such elements could be added‚Ä¶ so I would have to add to all of them a function which does the stuff?
[13:17:10] <petermanser> instead of waiting for such elements and then trigger the function?
[13:17:53] <eddiemonge> petermanser:  it would be faster to call it directly then to add some listener, i think
[13:18:18] <petermanser> right. but is there such a listener/event?
[13:19:40] <eddiemonge> i think see ? livequery

[13:55:00] <yogiWiM> I'm having trouble with controlling event bubbling when I click on an image in an <a> and show a div that was also in that &lt;a&gt;
[13:56:33] <yogiWiM> I tried 'stopeventpropagation' but that forced a screen redraw, so it wasn't so useful.
[13:58:29] <yogiWiM> I've bound the click event to the two events, now I'm trying to bind it to one event and test to see the source, but event.target.parent is an object, so I can't compare to the text name of the object. Anysuggestions on how to get the object?

[14:25:17] <Cokegod> oh nvm, thought on a solution
[14:25:38] <yogiWiM> Sean: So that works for a single <img> used in an <a> (so ie will still :hover it if no js). But how am I going to do this for multiple <img>s in a row of icons? They all will report the same thing. What is the 'normal way of doing this?

So far it doesn't work the same as on localhost. Either i've failed to copy something, or it reacts differently to clicks....

[17:29:04] <webroasters> hi everyone. I've got a little issue. I don't know how to explain it, except show you the code and tell you the parts where it's not working... http://pastebin.com/GgGf772b  The problem is at line s 36-51
[17:29:20] <webroasters> I'm trying to develop a portion of an administration area to insert product options.
[17:30:04] <webroasters> like if the customer wants Ground Coffee or Bean Coffee, they can select that from the specific product, and it will add a price to the checkout.. That's the idea behind what you're looking at
[17:31:27] <webroasters> basically, when I add a sub-node for a particular dropdown list, I can't remove it
[17:31:47] <webroasters> the unix timestamp is being used as a unique id for every node
[17:32:05] <webroasters> it's not exactly a unix timestamp, but you know what I mean..
[17:36:11] <webroasters> anyone?
[17:41:49] <webroasters> OK.... found a problem with the code. The unixtm variable is not incrementing.. can someone tell me why>
[17:41:52] <webroasters> *?
[17:42:11] <webroasters> well, i don't mean incrementing, i mean it's not changing
[17:42:46] <webroasters> some help?
[18:06:06] <Mage_Dude> webroasters: I'll take an uninformed and essentially random guess...
[18:07:51] <Mage_Dude> Pulling the time may not happen exactly as you want it to. Depending on when browsers let JS execute you may not get exact timing. So two statements may be executed at the 'same time' (as far as JS is concerned), or some time apart.
[18:08:43] <Mage_Dude> But if it's not incrementing at all, I suggest a little experiment. Create a blank document with only that statement appending the value to an element within a loop to see if that's the correct statement to use.
[18:09:13] <webroasters> ok 1 sec
[18:09:53] <tomasm-> hey theres some piece of code somewhere that is disabling a button and i cant seem to figure out where.... is there a way to figure out what's causing it?
[18:14:08] <webroasters> i've narrowed it down and did what you said, but I can't seem to see what's going wrong. Here's the narrowed code to just the basics http://pastebin.com/xd0ZEBd8
[18:14:08] <Mage_Dude> Search through the code for either the ID or class and possibly calls to disable()?
[18:14:26] <webroasters> it's just 50 lines now
[18:16:16] <webroasters> OK... i have a better question now... the guy who was helping out this noob (that would be me btw), started this off with this line "(function( $ ){"   ... if I have the same line inside of that one, wouldn't that create the problem>
[18:16:19] <webroasters> *?
[18:16:22] <Mage_Dude> webroasters: Can you do me a favor (since you have more of the code), can you put it into jsfiddle? That way I can see relevant HTML, JS...so on.
[18:16:33] <webroasters> ok, 1 sec
[18:17:13] <webroasters> you want the whole thing, or just the part from that last pastebin??
[18:17:59] <webroasters> just wondering though, one can have this kind of code "(function( $ ){"   "(function( $ ){"  and it doesn't conflict?
[18:18:12] <webroasters> in other words, that line inside of the other line
[18:18:41] <coldhead> no, you can't nest those
[18:18:48] <webroasters> http://jsfiddle.net/gCWAa/
[18:18:55] <webroasters> ok, well, there's the problem
[18:19:07] <webroasters> how do i do what I'm trying to do then
[18:21:42] <webroasters> ok, well, that's what I need to do, is find a way to nest that kind of thing together
[18:23:46] <Mage_Dude> webroasters: That's pretty nice looking
[18:24:18] <webroasters> ...you're being sarcastic, aren't you
[18:24:21] <webroasters> :D
[18:25:28] <Mage_Dude> No, that's actually pretty neat. But I see the issue with it not removing itself
[18:25:45] <webroasters> well, thank you, i appreciate that
[18:26:13] <webroasters> this has been a painful thing I knew I'd have to come across, but I finally decided to take it head on, and get it done
[18:26:25] <webroasters> but it's obviously the nesting issue
[18:27:14] <webroasters> i know this can be done because I've seen it done in Magento Commerce
[18:27:33] <Mage_Dude> What's the purpose of the outer function($)?
[18:28:09] <webroasters> that's a good question, I didn't really know why the guy who helped me re-arrange my code, did that
[18:28:14] <webroasters> let me test it real fast.
[18:29:29] <webroasters> yeah, it fails big time if you take that out
[18:30:48] <Mage_Dude> I'll play for a minute and see what I can do.
[18:31:44] <webroasters> thanks Mage Dude
[18:34:21] <Mage_Dude> I see a few things. One: You've nested DocumentReady, there shouldn't be a need to do that. Two: When dynamically adding elements you can't use .bind(), you have to use .live(). Bind only works on elements that exist at the time the script runs. Live works on elements now and those that exist (and match the selector) in the future as well.
[18:34:35] <Mage_Dude> First try replacing the .bind() with .live()
[18:35:20] <Mage_Dude> I bet it works now ;)
[18:35:36] <Mage_Dude> Just tried the .bind()->.live() and that seems to work.
[18:38:21] <Mage_Dude> webroasters: Also, is it possible to update to a newer version of JQ?
[18:38:41] <webroasters> ok 1 sec, thanks
[18:39:25] <webroasters> it does work!! Thanks dude!!
[18:39:29] <sec_> hi
[18:39:31] <webroasters> I'll look into what else you were saying
[18:39:42] <sec_> how to make nice menu bar?
[18:40:38] <Mage_Dude> sec_: I'd google for 'smashing magazine menu bar' and you'll see nice examples
[18:41:11] <sec_> Mage_Dude: let me see. thx
[18:46:10] <Mage_Dude> Hi sec_, please read the Channel Topic. No PMs. Ask in the channel and if anyone has time they'll help you

[19:41:53] <dogarrhea2> i am having trouble figuring out what the ui variable in $( ".selector" ).draggable({ start: function(event, ui) { ... }});   is ... any ides?
[19:43:12] <chrisvtx1> isn't that a reference to the jquery ui object?\
[19:45:09] <dogarrhea2> am unfamiliar with that
[19:45:37] <Heshanh> why is it that when i set a default date for a datepicker input box it doesnt show
[19:45:56] <Heshanh> like value="2011-11-11" on the inputbox
[19:46:44] <dogarrhea2> hrm. alert(ui.draggable) is undefined
[19:47:07] <chrisvtx1> ui is the current jquery ui instance
[19:47:24] <chrisvtx1> .draggable is the jquery ui method related to your current ui instance
[19:47:35] <chrisvtx1> if it is not defined
[19:47:52] <chrisvtx1> double check your code to make sure you created a ui object
[19:48:03] <chrisvtx1> before invoking .draggable
[19:50:17] <dogarrhea2> hrm. http://jsfiddle.net/DUnvU/  <---- i'm doing a draggable intialization and using start at the same time..
[19:56:04] <chrisvtx1> that code has a syntax error
[19:56:58] <chrisvtx1> after your "start" function is defined, you don't end the object inside of your draggable method
[19:57:00] <meinmkv> any suggestions as to plugins to modal out a google map area while information is loading? it seems like a simple enough task to do myself but if someone/something has already dealt with all the cross browser stuff, i am all ears.
[19:59:14] <meinmkv> also something i would use app wide for consistency - not just with a map area
[19:59:22] <sec_> anyone remember name of plugin that allow edit content of site? (chrome, firefox)
[20:00:46] <chrisvtx1> meinmkv: i use jquery ui for all modal features.  it works perfectly.
[20:00:50] <dogarrhea2> chrisvtx1, sure there's going to be a syntax error but the point is that it alerts "undefined"
[20:01:39] <chrisvtx1> then i would look at your selector
[20:01:48] <meinmkv> you can modal out (disable) an item with jUI?
[20:01:54] <woopwoop> hi, I have a json object with html code in it (<div), but when I use .html(json.object), it doesn't print out any of the html tags
[20:02:02] <woopwoop> is that some security thing?
[20:02:03] <meinmkv> i know they have the modal window
[20:02:10] <BobHolt> dogarrhea2: it alerts undefined because draggable is not a property of ui
[20:02:15] <chrisvtx1> if there is no valid selector, then there is nothing to drag
[20:02:29] <dogarrhea2> it drags ok.
[20:02:32] <meinmkv> woopwoop: you try escaping the tags?
[20:02:37] <BobHolt> the properties of ui are helper, offset, originalPosition, and position
[20:02:39] <dogarrhea2> i'm just trying to get the id of the div i'm dragging
[20:02:49] <woopwoop> how do I escape it?
[20:02:57] <dogarrhea2> i've tried $(ui.draggable).attr("id") and that is undefined too
[20:03:07] <meinmkv> you trying to output the html?
[20:03:10] <meinmkv> that you receive
[20:03:36] <meinmkv> ah yea you are
[20:03:40] <woopwoop> i've copied the html from the json obj, into a plain html file and it looks fine
[20:03:44] <meinmkv> (reread your comment)
[20:04:05] <BobHolt> dog: ui.helper[0].id
[20:04:24] <meinmkv> hmm - escaping the carrots < > with their ascii equivalents
[20:04:41] <meinmkv> feel like there _should_ be a cleaner route
[20:04:50] <woopwoop> oh wait, it's actually - when it's in the json those tags were converted to \u00a0
[20:04:57] <BobHolt> better: ui.helper.context.id
[20:05:05] <meinmkv> http://www.asciitable.com/
[20:05:13] <woopwoop> and it's getting the obj from mysql where it's actually using html code
[20:05:42] <meinmkv> yea, im willing to bet its an escaping issue
[20:05:44] <woopwoop> so i guess it's more a php question? 	$woop = strip_tags(json_encode($rows));
[20:08:54] <fructose> coldhead: I didn't realize earlier that solution you gave doesn't return the full set of elements, nor does it work properly on an empty set
[20:10:10] <fructose> If anyone else wants to give it a try, I'm trying to join/implode a set of elements with, for example, <br/>
[20:14:42] <fructose> But maybe I'm going about it the wrong way... I want to construct a list of names and insert it in a page, all in one table cell, separated by <br/>. I have the names and was going to do nameLIst = nameList.add(jQuery('<span></span>').text(name)) to each one
[20:15:03] <fructose> Then comes adding <br/> and somehow inserting the list as one
[20:15:41] <woopwoop> why not just do a list? <li></li>
[20:15:51] <chrisvtx1> yes
[20:15:58] <BobHolt> when in doubt: use semantic markup
[20:16:05] <chrisvtx1> an ordered, or unordered list
[20:16:35] <chrisvtx1> or in the span, you can set the style rule for "display:block"
[20:17:23] <fructose> Can't really see a reason why not... I'll give it a try, thanks
[20:19:19] <fructose> And how would I take a set of those and be able to insert that into a cell? When I was just doing one element, I could use .html('blah blah <img src="...">')
[20:20:22] <coldhead> fructose: http://jsfiddle.net/3EBQG/
[20:20:42] <coldhead> the list is a better idea though
[20:20:45] <coldhead> >_>
[20:22:25] <coldhead> listy http://jsfiddle.net/3EBQG/1/
[20:23:15] <fructose> coldhead: I guess my main issue with that is that I don't want to append, I want to replace
[20:23:29] <coldhead> just use html() instead of append
[20:23:39] <coldhead> oh and reverse the src and destination
[20:24:02] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/3EBQG/2/
[20:27:03] <fructose> coldhead: Ah, thanks. Does a set of jQuery elements process as an HTML string or something? The docs don't say html() accepts anything else
[20:27:41] <coldhead> jQuery usually works pretty well when you pass other jQuery objects as arguments
[20:27:55] <coldhead> you can usually get away with it :)
[20:32:57] <woopwoop> so I have a json object i got from mysql and outputted through php as echo "<script> var test = {"stuff": " . $jsonObj . " };</script>"
[20:33:03] <woopwoop> how do I use jquery to decode it?
[20:33:45] <woopwoop> json_encode from php adds \u00a0 before every html tag
[20:35:48] <coldhead> is all that var test stuff necessary, woopwoop?
[20:36:01] <coldhead> if you can get the PHP to emit pure valid JSON
[20:36:06] <coldhead> then you can tell jQuery to expect that
[20:36:20] <coldhead> and it will parse it for you and re-construct your object
[20:38:20] <woopwoop> i'm new to it, intially I thought I had to encode it through php since it's fetching from mysql, print it out as a js object and let jquery manipulate the json itself
[20:38:50] <woopwoop> but what you said sounds mor logically
[20:39:40] <abjorn> what do you know, coldhead, its your first day
[20:44:02] <woopwoop> thanks guys
[21:01:24] <hasenj> question: when I try to rebind "click" on a button, it seems to just add yet another handler instead of clearing the old handler and adding the new one, is this by design or am I doing something wrong?
[21:01:39] <hasenj> http://jsfiddle.net/bCXuQ/
[21:02:23] <hasenj> I'm trying to make a button "toggle" between two states
[21:04:45] <hasenj> it does get fixed when I unbind('click') first,
[21:05:17] <hasenj> but the docs don't say anything about that: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[21:07:11] <coldhead> it doesn't clear existing handlers, hasenj
[21:07:16] <coldhead> you can add as many as you like
[21:07:29] <coldhead> and unbind whichever you don't
[21:07:48] <hasenj> oksushi, thanks coldhead
[21:07:51] <hasenj> wops
[21:07:53] <hasenj> sorry
[21:08:00] <oksushi> yw
[21:08:01] <hasenj> hit tab at the wrong place, hehe
[21:08:09] <hasenj> meant to say ok :P
[21:08:23] <coldhead> couldn't have done it without you, oksushi
[21:08:30] <hasenj> hahaha
[21:08:34] * oksushi glows with pride
[21:08:53] <oksushi> either that or Radium
[21:35:04] <dogarrhea2> hrm. what is this undocumented ui.helper feature
[21:36:07] <diverdude> If i have a reference to this, and i know its a span residing inside a list (ul,li), how do i get the first node of this list?
[21:38:38] <coldhead> it's not soo undocumented, dogarrhea2
[21:39:08] <coldhead> i've used it in draggables, when you drag a clone of an item, rather than the item itself
[21:39:18] <coldhead> the helper is a reference to the clone
[21:39:30] <dogarrhea2> hmm
[21:39:43] <coldhead> diverdude: $(this).closest('ul').find('li:first')
[21:40:58] <diverdude> thx
[21:43:33] <glaksmono> hello, how do you submit a form in JS, that will act something like input type=submit ?
[21:43:49] <glaksmono> in jQuery i meant, i tried using $('#form_id').submit() it doesn't seem like doing what it's suppose to
[21:43:58] <glaksmono> or what i thought it's suppose to be doing
[21:44:43] <hesh> im appending a inputbox to a div on Click. how do i live bind datepicker to that?
[21:45:18] <hesh> the input box have a .datepick class i need to attach the date picker to that
[21:45:53] <coldhead> glaksmono: http://jsfiddle.net/ZdXfv/
[21:45:57] <coldhead> submit works for me there
[21:46:11] <coldhead> you'll see it submit and a new jsfiddle page come back
[21:46:59] <coldhead> hesh: you can't really live bind like that, you need to call datePicker() or whatever on the new content to make it work
[21:47:08] <coldhead> at the same time you're inserting it
[21:47:25] <coldhead> i guess inside the click() handler
[21:47:39] <glaksmono> coldhead: hmm... what if u use id?
[21:47:43] <glaksmono> form id="foo"
[21:47:50] <coldhead> if the id is correct it will work!
[21:47:52] <coldhead> try it on my demo
[21:47:59] <coldhead> $('#foo')
[21:49:21] <glaksmono> coldhead: hmm seems like it's still working, yes, but for me it doens't work for some reason
[21:49:30] <glaksmono> i put the submit on the callback function
[21:49:44] <glaksmono> when i console.log the thing, it returned me the form
[21:50:55] <coldhead> paste your code somewhere?
[21:51:09] <coldhead> ?p @ glaksmono
[21:51:09] <bot-t> glaksmono, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:51:30] <glaksmono> it's too much of a paste, ther'es a complex templates etc..
[21:51:46] <coldhead> there-in may lie your problem /
[21:52:01] <coldhead> does it work if you do $('#id').submit() at the console?
[21:58:21] <dogarrhea2> hrm.. so i ahve a div within a div.  i want every part except the div with the highest z value draggable.
[22:00:14] <glaksmono> coldhead: well, submit doesn't do anything :-/
[22:00:24] <glaksmono> coldhead: not sure why..
[22:01:34] <coldhead> glaksmono: try the native submit maybe
[22:01:45] <coldhead> in case there's some validator blocking your submit or something
[22:01:53] <coldhead> $('#id')[0].submit()
[22:05:48] <Taggnostr> I have "var links = $('#foo .bar a'); var current = links.filter(':first')", if I do "current.prev('a')" will it jump to another link that is not in links? is there a way to restrict .prev() to the content of 'links' only?
[22:06:53] <Taggnostr> or should I just use indexes?
[22:08:31] <dogarrhea2> does anyone have a strategy for making the children of divs undraggable when the parent is draggable?
[22:09:49] <dogarrhea2> hrm. will try the .draggable( "disable" ) method
[22:13:14] <glaksmono> omg, i can now use $('form').submit
[22:13:16] <glaksmono> but not with ID
[22:13:19] <glaksmono> what is going on lol
[22:13:52] <Taggnostr> can I do $(...)[3] to get the fourth element or do I have to use some function to get it?
[22:14:37] <dogarrhea2> hrm. making a child draggable('disable") doesn't work. it stil drag
[22:23:35] <dogarrhea2> hrm. seems like it would be a common functionality. don't drag the item when the item selected is the exit button..
[22:23:40] <dogarrhea2> why is jquery making it hard
[22:23:55] <dogarrhea2> or is my design not good enough and requires hundreds of lines of addtional code
[22:24:14] <coldhead> glaksmono: do you have a duplicate ID maybe?
[22:24:21] <dogarrhea2> would seem simple.. the exit button is a child of the parent window
[22:24:36] <dogarrhea2> let everything but the exit button allow draggable interaction
[22:25:55] <dogarrhea2> guess i will be writing a hack in the start function to see if the thing being dragged is the exit button
[22:27:01] <juha_> guten tagen
[22:31:12] <Taggnostr> why $(...).first() works but $(...)[0] doesn't? what should I use to get e.g. the second element?
[22:33:10] <Taggnostr> it's probably something obvious but googling I find every kind of unrelated things, like :nth-child, .slice, .index
[22:33:34] <gf3> Taggnostr: jQuery#first != [0]
[22:34:11] <Taggnostr> yes, that I figured out, I need something like .first() that allows me to get the second, third, etc too
[22:34:28] <gf3> Taggnostr: jQuery#eq
[22:35:05] <Taggnostr> gf3, that looks like what I was searching for, thanks
[22:36:45] <gf3> np
[23:08:05] <ExpFist> Man so frustrated. setInternal is not accurate at all
[23:08:16] <ExpFist> There arn't altneratives for accurate timing are there?
[23:13:32] <gf3> ExpFist: requestAnimationFrame
[23:15:59] <ExpFist> gf3: That works cross-browser?
[23:16:13] <gf3> no sir
[23:16:38] <Woet> ExpFist: it works cross-proper-browser
[23:16:59] <ExpFist> More specifically, will it work across any browser HTML5 Canvas is supported in?
[23:17:32] <Woet> it's supported by chrome >= 10, firefox >= 4 and IE >= 10
[23:17:39] <Woet> not supported in opera or  safari
[23:17:45] <Woet> so i guess that means no :)
[23:17:51] <ExpFist> Haha, crap
[23:18:16] <Woet> according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.mozRequestAnimationFrame#AutoCompatibilityTable that is
[23:19:19] <ExpFist> Damn, not even IE9
[23:19:21] <ExpFist> Funny enough: http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Graphics/RequestAnimationFrame/Default.html#
[23:19:33] <ExpFist> In IE9 it gives an error about unsupported. So horrible
[23:19:37] <Woet> that's why i said proper browsers :P
[23:19:43] <ExpFist> I guess for now I can create a hack for it
[23:20:06] <ExpFist> Check system time change then subtract the ms gained or lost from the next setInternal
[23:20:10] <ExpFist> But that's ugly as hell
[23:20:24] <ExpFist> setinterval rather
[23:20:32] <Woet> i found a workaround somewhere
[23:20:41] <Woet> that implements it for browers that dont have it
[23:22:51] <Woet> ExpFist: try http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/#comment-67367
[23:23:25] <ExpFist> Hmm
[23:23:47] <ExpFist> I guess I could use the standard method for new browers than my hack for 'non-proper' browsers
[23:23:59] <Woet> sounds good
[23:24:05] <ExpFist> Thanks woet
[23:24:47] <red> How do I get $ to work in jQuery in Drupal 7? (remove jQuery noConflict basicly)
[23:25:00] <red> I'm embedding some 3rd party plugins via form_alter and I don't want to edit those files
[23:25:27] <Woet> red: surely there is a reason drupal 7 uses noconflict?
[23:25:36] <Woet> and that disabling it will break it because of that reason? :)
[23:27:37] <red> woet: I know how I can override it myself
[23:27:43] <red> I need to override it on a file basis
[23:28:03] <red> (function ($) { })(jQuery); // works
[23:28:17] <red> BUT as said, I don't want to edit those 3rd party plugins every time they get updated
[23:28:25] <red> there needs to be (and probably is) a way around this
[23:28:48] <Woet> not using drupal? :)
[23:29:51] <Woet> red: http://drupal.org/node/171213
[23:29:57] <Woet> "In Drupal 7 jQuery.noConflict() is called to make it easier to use other JS libraries, so you'll either have to type out jQuery() or have the closure rename it for you."
[23:31:34] <red> no shit
[23:31:38] <virtualint> hi
[23:31:48] <red> I've read the docs
[23:31:57] <virtualint> i have delegated a live jquery event and how may i trigger the event
[23:32:05] <Berzerrkerrr> hi, im having a problem when i fetch a .php file,wich i with .load()
[23:32:22] <Berzerrkerrr> hi, im having a problem when i fetch a .php file,with require inside, with .load()
[23:32:32] <red> As I said, I do NOT want to start editing 3rd party plugins (aka: add closures to them), it's a hindurance when they get updated, and I know the plugins wont collide with anything.
[23:32:56] <virtualint> how to trigger a live jquery event
[23:33:44] <gorkha> I have a problem with JQuery.post caching results, so my live search is only working when first letter is pressed
[23:35:20] <gorkha> url = ROOT_URL+"search/";
[23:35:20] <gorkha> $.post(url, $("#input-supportlist-autofield").serialize(), function(data){
[23:35:20] <gorkha> 	  $('#tab2').html(data);
[23:35:20] <gorkha> 	  showTab(2);
[23:35:20] <gorkha> 	});
[23:37:02] <gorkha> It's not standard behaviour caching results from post because it doesn't make sense. I wonder why I does that in this case?
[23:42:09] <bambanx> i am new guys , i am testing code on local , how i can simulate latency ?
[23:42:16] <bambanx> i mean like a load time
[23:43:21] <pootietang> use deffered
[23:43:39] <pootietang> I'm new as well so I can't help you much!
[23:43:56] <pootietang> testing it as we speak and having trouble with it
[23:47:02] <dogarrhea2> cool. solved earlier problem with stopprogation
[23:47:59] <Nuck> this.data('tagInput').tagHolder.children() <-- this returns an empty array, yet if I log tagHolder, it shows me an element with children
[23:48:18] <Nuck> Is there some way to get an update on that DOM node?
[23:53:21] <waseem_> Why does $('#header') gives me [div#header] instead of div#header. It wraps the element inside an array. Is it expected?
[23:53:50] <coldhead> yes, waseem_
[23:53:51] <Nuck> waseem_: Aye, 'tis how jQuery objects work
[23:54:01] <coldhead> it's for consistency
[23:54:09] <waseem_> Okay.
[23:54:13] <coldhead> it always returns an array, usually with many elements
[23:54:33] <Nuck> It's actually nice.  I can handle one or many elements with the same code
[23:55:06] <waseem_> Okay. I will ask another question but first let me make some gists with relevant code.
