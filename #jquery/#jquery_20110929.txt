[00:04:18] <zulu-gula> how to read .scrollTop and wait for some value, and if reached - run animation?
[00:04:32] <DEADBEEF_> Hey guys, what's the best method to run a selector which returns a live list of elements which are updated as the page changes?
[00:04:55] <Cork[home]> DEADBEEF_: re run the selector
[00:05:01] <Cork[home]> there is no live update
[00:05:50] <Cork[home]> zulu-gula: you can lisen for the scroll event
[00:06:05] <Cork[home]> then check this.scrollTop
[00:10:33] <DEADBEEF_> So there's no way at all to get a sort of live nodelist based on a selector?
[00:11:34] <Cork[home]> DEADBEEF_: sure, create a global variable
[00:11:34] <sean`> DEADBEEF_, take a look at livequer
[00:11:35] <sean`> y
[00:11:44] <Cork[home]> and update it with the a selector run in a timer
[00:11:45] <sean`> Also, live for events
[00:12:11] <Cork[home]> DEADBEEF_: whats the problem with just using the selector?
[00:13:15] <DEADBEEF_> Nothing in principle, but if it's possible (and fairly straightforward) to get a live list it'll save a bunch of code.
[00:13:45] <Cork[home]> DEADBEEF_: simplest would prob be to create a small wrapper function that does the selection
[00:13:53] <Cork[home]> and return the generated jquery object
[00:14:30] <Cork[home]> DEADBEEF_: might as well tell why this is needed
[00:14:48] <Cork[home]> many browsers doesn't have a way to tell js if the dom has changed
[00:15:06] <Cork[home]> so there is nothing to trigger it on, so it would have to go on a constant timer update
[00:15:19] <Cork[home]> thats a waist of process time
[00:34:35] <sasori> is this correct way of counting the anchor tags inside a div using jquery ? $('div#educmaininfo a').length
[00:35:51] <koszi> imho, yes, nothing wrong with it
[00:36:14] <sean`> sasori, no, the correct way would be $('#educmaininfo a').length
[00:36:31] <sean`> semantically speaking
[00:36:57] <sasori> is it also ok to use that inside a for loop like this? for(i = 0; i < $('#educmaininfo a').length  ; i++)
[00:37:20] <Cork[home]> sasori: it is, but it will be slower then needed
[00:37:30] <Cork[home]> as the selector will run each iteration
[00:38:03] <Cork[home]> a better choice is to store the length in a variable, and use that instead
[00:38:25] <nail_> or use each()
[00:38:28] <sasori> my problem is, i have this div, it has a dynamic data,.it has atleast maximum 3 rows of data, now each row has an ID..i don't know what's the best way to put a unique ID on each
[00:39:22] <Cork[home]> sasori: most of the time an id isn't needed, as long as you store references to the elements in variables
[00:39:38] <blackspotwiggins> at least maximum?
[00:39:49] <Cork[home]> lol
[00:39:54] <sasori> blackspotwiggins: sorry grammar nazi :P
[00:40:16] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, because that was obviously a grammar issue
[00:40:32] <Cork[home]> rather a contradiction :)
[00:43:38] <richardr> I have two arrays, I want to put every value of the array through a regular expression. I don't care about the old values. What is the easiest way to achieve this? Thanks.
[00:44:27] <coldhead> ?map @ richardr
[00:44:38] <coldhead> come on bot-t
[00:44:45] <richardr> Haha
[00:44:47] <Eviltwin> ?.map
[00:44:47] <blackspotwiggins> bot-t, wake up!!
[00:44:59] <blackspotwiggins> he can be so lazy
[00:45:15] <richardr> Haha, .map() - thanks
[00:47:02] <Clorith> Can the .change() event be used to get the old value of a select box, hoping to trigger a "readonly" like functionality to a form
[00:47:44] <fatninja> Color animation in query 1.6 anyone ?
[00:48:40] <arnold_mad> anyone can help with the following: I need to preload > 1000 images to the browser with javascript so that they are available fast but the problem is that it is filling up too much ram
[00:48:46] <arnold_mad> is there a way to avoid that (so that they are preloaded but Image object is not used) ?
[01:01:23] <richardr> What is the most efficient way of calculating all margin, padding, and borders on an element? When I place an element on the page, I want to set the outerWidth, not width -- and I need to calculate all of those to do so.
[01:02:55] <sean`> richardr, outerWidth(true) - width ()
[01:03:23] <Nasga> anyone know a good way to improve debug via window.onerror
[01:03:52] <richardr> sean`: I don't want to include the width.
[01:04:04] <richardr> sean`: only margin, padding & border widths.
[01:04:07] <sean`> richardr, I know, that's why I'm substracting it
[01:04:08] <Nasga> with full ajax application, when errors occurs, it's a pain to see how it happen
[01:04:22] <richardr> sean`: ah, smart.
[01:04:26] <richardr> sean`: thanks...
[01:04:37] <richardr> sean`: can I rely on the accuracy of this result?
[01:04:39] <gerryvdm> morning all, say i start 2 separate async $.ajax requests, whats the most elegant way to execute a callback when both have completed?
[01:04:49] <blackspotwiggins> Nasga, use firebug?
[01:04:55] <sean`> richardr, everyone else does
[01:05:10] <Nasga> blackspotwiggins: i already use, but this is more to debug in production
[01:05:32] <Nasga> on each window.onerror, i send mails via an ajax query
[01:06:06] <Nasga> this work nice, but i need more traces...
[01:06:37] <ajpiano> gerryvdm: $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax() ).then( function(data, data) { });
[01:06:38] <sean`> gerryvdm, $.when ($.get (..), $.get (..)
[01:06:42] <johanhar> I have a div with 5 tables. $("div").find("table").each(function() { console.log(this); }); It only logs one table, not all of them....
[01:06:47] <sean`> omg, sof ast
[01:06:57] <ajpiano> ok well looks like sean`'s got it from here, bedtime for me
[01:07:06] <sean`> NN <#
[01:07:07] <sean`> <3
[01:07:20] <gerryvdm> ajpiano, sean`, thx never saw that function before, should keep better track of jquery :)
[01:07:25] <Nasga> johanhar: did you have checked your dom ?
[01:07:36] <johanhar> Nasga: what do you mean?
[01:08:05] <Nasga> johanhar: with firebug, check that your tables are in the div
[01:08:22] <Nasga> on the dom, not in the source
[01:08:27] <arnold_mad> arnold_mad: anyone can help with the following: I need to preload > 1000 images to the browser with javascript so that they are available fast but the problem is that it is filling up too much ram
[01:08:27] <arnold_mad> [09:48] arnold_mad: is there a way to avoid that (so that they are preloaded but Image object is not used) ?
[01:08:55] <blackspotwiggins> arnold_mad, set the url as src, it should fetch them
[01:09:02] <blackspotwiggins> they are going to use ram anyway tho
[01:09:19] <arnold_mad> the problem is that in ram there is not the jpeg but the decompressed version
[01:09:20] <johanhar> Nasga: nvm, found the bug
[01:09:23] <johanhar> thanks anyway
[01:09:24] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[01:09:40] <arnold_mad> blackspotwiggins: so my > 1000 images will use 1.5GB ram
[01:09:52] <blackspotwiggins> well, that's what you get if you want to load > 1000 images
[01:10:09] <uchuff> long shot but does anyone know the name of that javascript library (can't remember for sure if it was a jquery plugin) for fitting text into a box? like say you have a square with 4 words of varying length on different lines it kinda adjusts their font size so they make a square
[01:10:23] <uchuff> bad explanation (which is why my google searches are failing!)
[01:10:45] <uchuff> * so they fill a square
[01:10:56] <richardr> I'm appending an element, simply to grab the outerWidth of it. I'm just wondering while appending an element, how can I store that element instance to [a] work on it, and [b] destroy it after I get the outerWidth? I need to be sure I destroy the one I create
[01:10:59] <blackspotwiggins> uchuff, text-align:justify ?
[01:11:01] <arnold_mad> blackspotwiggins: is there a possibility to use only 1 image object and that the preloaded image resides on the harddisk of the browser
[01:11:21] <uchuff> lol blackspotwiggins, thanks but no :)
[01:11:21] <blackspotwiggins> arnold_mad, cache limit hits way before 1.5gtb
[01:11:22] <arnold_mad> blackspotwiggins: the goal is to have a loop that goes through the images very fast
[01:11:22] <blackspotwiggins> gb
[01:11:40] <blackspotwiggins> i wouldnt want a site load a ton of shit to my cache
[01:11:50] <mookoo> hi all, I'm using jquery ui tabs with a spinner to show if content gets loaded or not. prolem is, that the spinner does not disappear when the content finished loading. I tried to pass $( "#tabs" ).tabs( "option", "spinner", "" ); with the content retrieved, but that has no effect on the spinner.
[01:11:56] <uchuff> if you imagine the "Frankie says relax" logo http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yXT9-FolIFk/TH2kNfxwolI/AAAAAAAAAHM/oeHiBFhzhek/s200/Frankie+says+relax_small.gif
[01:11:57] <arnold_mad> blackspotwiggins: its for a special application that needs to do that
[01:12:03] <uchuff> how the text is resized to fill the box perfectly
[01:12:07] <blackspotwiggins> arnold_mad, well, develop a custom app then?
[01:12:14] <uchuff> there was a javascript library for doing that
[01:12:21] <uchuff> can't remember the name
[01:12:43] <arnold_mad> blackspotwiggins: thats what I want to do but my app is web based so I can only use javascript for preloading

[01:28:27] <Anticom> hi all
[01:29:17] <Anticom> let's say i've got a table containint 10 tr's... now i want to select 3rd to last (10th) tr and iterate through them... what would be the smartest way to do that?
[01:33:54] <quicksilver> Anticom: $('#tableid tr:gt(2)')
[01:34:29] <quicksilver> actually :gt(1)
[01:35:03] <Anticom> no 2 would be right... i want to skipp no. 1 and 2
[01:35:13] <Anticom> ah right
[01:35:15] <Anticom> i got it
[01:35:16] <Anticom> sure
[01:50:59] <Anticom> by using each(selector, function(i, val) {...}); i'm iterating over the various tr's... now i want to kind of subselect td's of the current tr... how to do that? simply $(val).('td:first') ??
[01:52:19] <quicksilver> Anticom: $(val).find('td:first')
[01:52:27] <Anticom> k thanks
[01:53:03] <ravenzz> $('tr').each(function(){ $(this).find('td') });
[01:53:28] <ravenzz> first selects the 1st matched element
[01:54:43] <ravenzz> or just $('tr td').foo(); depends on what are you trying to do
[01:54:47] <sejo> is there a slideshow plugin (two boxes one with images, one with text for that image) that you guys use?
[01:55:01] <sejo> I've found a lot of tools but not one with separated text/image
[01:55:08] <sejo> or I see it wrong?
[01:55:58] <ravenzz> sejo flexslider ?
[01:56:11] <ravenzz> you have the image and the caption
[01:56:40] <sejo> is that jquery based?
[01:56:42] <ravenzz> I think that most of the provide you the ability to include a caption

[02:31:09] <Flizzo> hi ! I'm using jquery autocomplete and I juste have a question about the format of the url : indeed when I do url : "/myapp/url.do" it works but if I put "url.do" it doesn't ; I would like to know if it's possible to avoid specifying the context "/myapp" ?
[02:36:58] <bjensen> Flizzo: Um..how would it then know where to post to?
[02:37:09] <bjensen> sorry fetch from
[02:37:32] <xec> dytrivedi: good question, i'm not sure if that's possible, seeing as all events bound with .live() are attached to the same element, and return false; or stopPropagation will only stop events on parent elements afaik
[02:38:10] <dytrivedi> yeah, I tried stopImmediatePropagation as well but of no use

[02:51:24] <c2c> Hello, Is it possible to "catch" a default event in a .click() function, like event.preventDefault(); var default = event.getDefault(); [code with ajax and async code] default.trigger();

[03:02:54] <Slartibart> Hi. I'm using $('...').appendTo('body').fadeTo(300,1). Sometimes the fadeTo() doesn't happen, is this because it can't be done like that, or somehow because of firebug? Animations in general seem to work not so well when debugging/stepping through things.
[03:05:34] <axle3d> c2c: thanks that worked
[03:07:31] <Slartibart> Also $('input:eq(0)') works, but what about if I'd like to have the first form element, even if that was f.ex. a select? Is that possible?
[03:08:56] <quicksilver> Slartibart: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[03:09:30] <NodeX> monring guys, quick performance question .. in CSS it's quicker for the parser to not include the node name in a query .. i.e a.foo is slower than .foo .... is jquery the same ?
[03:09:54] <Slartibart> Ahh, ok, didn't know about that one. Thanks quicksilver
[03:10:02] <NodeX> I assume it's faster to include the node name but just want to be sure !
[03:11:41] <quicksilver> NodeX: depends on the browser, I believe.
[03:11:52] <NodeX> in general what's best practise?
[03:11:54] <quicksilver> '.node' should be faster on browsers which have a fast get elements by class
[03:12:04] <quicksilver> benchmark if you need to care, stop worrying if you don't :
[03:12:06] <quicksilver> :)
[03:12:30] <NodeX> I didn't want to be using useless memory - I use node.class for my own sanity really
[03:12:38] <NodeX> if it was a major performance drain I was going to stop
[03:12:51] <Nomikos> Does the UI .removeClass(class, duration) not animate colours?
[03:13:54] <Nomikos> Gah, nm, works, wrong library 3 times in a row >.<
[03:18:27] <NodeX> db.jobs.find({id:1226123});
[03:18:30] <NodeX> oops sorry
[03:19:15] <Slartibart> $('...').appendTo('body').fadeTo(300,1) is still *highly
[03:19:22] <Slartibart> * unreliable for me
[03:20:21] <Slartibart> Could it be that fadeto attempts to animate before the element has finished attaching itself to the tree? But then I guess it should appear as having opacity 1 instead :-/
[03:20:23] <Nomikos> Slartibart: if you're fading to 1, why not use fadeIn ?
[03:20:32] <axle3d> Am trying to achieve something like $('element').myFunction() using JQuery
[03:20:32] <Slartibart> Nomikos: Have tried that as well
[03:20:45] <Slartibart> Thanks for suggestion though.
[03:20:49] <axle3d> how is this done?
[03:21:08] <Nomikos> Slartibart: and the element is hidden initially?
[03:21:08] <NodeX> google "jquery plugin authoring" axle3d
[03:21:25] <NodeX> it's a great read on the jquery site which will get you started
[03:21:26] <Slartibart> Nomikos: Yes, opacity 0 in CSS.'
[03:21:30] <axle3d> NodeX: ok
[03:22:28] <Nomikos> Slartibart: I seem to remember I've done things like hide(), then append() then fadeIn
[03:22:52] <Slartibart> Nomikos: So when I browse the tree after those jquery calls the element seems to be there, always. But A lot of times the opacity hasn't been changed, so it's invisible.
[03:23:04] <Slartibart> Good idea, I'll try that right away :)
[03:23:35] <Nomikos> Slartibart: maybe display or visibility properties are still set to none, or something like that?
[03:24:56] <NodeX> you need to quickly unhide then hide after getting the property - it's the same concept as getting widths/heights from hidden elements
[03:26:18] <Slartibart> Nomikos: According to firebug display and visibility are ok, 'block' and 'visible'.
[03:26:27] <Nomikos> :-/
[03:27:56] <Nomikos> Haven't played with css opacity much, prefer using the fade*/hide/show stuff
[03:28:15] <Nomikos> Can you reproduce it in jsfiddle?
[03:31:49] <Nomikos> Ok, this /should/ be simple - I'm clicking to animate something, then clicking something that sets a class on it, but then the animation finishes *after* and the class is gone again
[03:31:56] <Nomikos> What was the solution for that again?
[03:32:08] <Slartibart> Nomikos: You know, it seems to work now =).. When you said that prefer thing I thought I'd try removing opacity 0 from CSS, and just do $(...).hide().appendTo('body').fadeIn..() .
[03:32:20] <Nomikos> Slartibart: cool :-)
[03:32:28] <Slartibart> Nomikos: callbacks?
[03:32:59] <Nomikos> Hmno, they're two clicks, I just have to check that it's not still animating or something, or que the class-switch after the animation somehpw
[03:33:07] <Slartibart> ah, ok
[03:33:54] <Nomikos> I know it's a common problem :-p /me googles some more
[03:43:34] <ThoMe> hello.
[03:43:53] <ThoMe> when the user write in a input-field "blub" then i would like change this to "blaa"
[03:44:01] <ThoMe> i think onchange  && regex?
[03:44:06] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[03:44:28] <Nomikos> yes, definitely
[03:44:38] <Nomikos> do you want to do it onBlur?
[03:44:59] <Nomikos> or while the user is still typing?
[03:46:02] <ThoMe> still typing
[03:46:53] <Nomikos> Then you'd have to have a function running with a setInterval I think, and remove it as soon as the user leaves the text input again
[03:47:15] <Nomikos> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval
[03:47:40] <ThoMe> not with jquery?
[03:49:02] <quicksilver> you could run it on keypress instead
[03:49:05] <quicksilver> up to you.
[03:49:13] <quicksilver> nothing wrong with setInterval, btw :)
[03:49:14] <Nomikos> ah, yeah, that's probably better
[03:49:20] <quicksilver> just because something isn't in jQuery doesn't mean it isn't good.
[03:49:24] <Nomikos> setInterval would need more useless CPU cycles
[03:49:29] <quicksilver> jQuery doesn't need to reimplement things which work.
[03:50:00] <quicksilver> Nomikos: not very many, if you only turn it on on focus, and turn it off on blur, but still - keypress is more elegant.
[03:50:10] * Nomikos nods
[03:50:58] <Ankabout> can anyone help me solve a sliding problem where it jumps. I've read all the docs and stuff about the jumping 'bug' but I can't seem to solve it in my case
[03:51:40] <Ankabout> http://www.merelvanbeukering.com/news   the "read more" and "read less" links make the paragraph jump by exactly 24px, which is double the margin of the <p> element.
[03:55:03] <Nomikos> ThoMe: in a quick test keyup() works better still, it also works if you click outside the field after finishing the trigger word
[03:56:45] <styol> Ankabout: there appears to be an empty <p> </p> at the top of each that it doesn't like
[03:57:00] <styol> Ankabout: when its removed from the element, the jumping doesn't occur
[03:57:16] <Ankabout> ahhhhh yes now I see
[03:57:17] <Ankabout> thanks!
[03:58:52] <Ankabout> solved it. thanks!
[03:58:57] <ThoMe> Nomikos: ok... i test it
[03:59:16] <styol> no problem
[04:02:17] <ThoMe> Nomikos: how i can use regex?
[04:02:37] <ThoMe> i wuld like change the domain vom "test.de" to "blub.de" (with keyup(works fine))
[04:02:40] <ThoMe> but how?
[04:03:55] <Nomikos> ThoMe: with string.replace() ? someVar.replace(/test.de/, 'blub.de')
[04:04:29] <Nomikos> hrm. I guess the . is a wildcard there..
[04:05:34] <Nomikos> ThoMe: if you can keep it simple, keep it simple and do foo.replace(/test/, 'blub'); :-) if you need trickier things, please check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[04:05:56] <Nomikos> it's a bit outside the scope of this channel, and definitely outside my area of expertise
[04:16:04] <jacof> jQuery("div.notitle .header-left, div.notitle .header-middle, div.notitle .header-right").remove(); <- good ?
[04:17:54] <slavka`> hey guys... using the following to inject jquery into a page... and then im trying to select something but its failing i.e. not selecting anyting... if (jQuery) returns true so im at a loss here....
[04:18:25] <NodeX> whats "the following"
[04:18:27] <Nomikos> jacof: does it work?
[04:18:56] <jacof> Nomikos: i dont know
[04:19:29] <Nomikos> uh.. well. are the target elements removed?
[04:21:06] <inad922> hello
[04:21:38] <slavka`> so does anyone know how i can actually select something?
[04:21:40] <inad922> If in a script tag I have variable definitions outside a $() function why can't I access them from the inside?
[04:21:43] <slavka`> after i inject jquery
[04:21:44] <inad922> or how can I?
[04:21:44] <slavka`> ?
[04:22:17] <NodeX> slavka` : pastebin your code
[04:22:18] <inad922> selected="selected" for a chosen element
[04:22:45] <NodeX> $("the-seelct-box").val('what-you-want-to-select')
[04:34:02] <jhine> $(function() { $('td.c_info-r').each(function() {  $(this).insertAfter('td.c_last'); }); $('tr.c_info').each(function() { $(this).hide(); }); });  - Just started learning so I apologise in advance. http://s1.zetaboards.com/James/index/ - If you run that in console you'll see my problem. It appears to copy EVERY td.c_info-r instead of just the nearest and moving it to the nearest td.c_last
[04:34:44] <NodeX> give it a context
[04:34:56] <jhine> How?
[04:35:07] <NodeX> $(selector,context)
[04:35:28] <NodeX> for example ... $('.foo',$("#bar")) .. get's all .foo's in #bar
[04:37:58] <jhine> I get the same issue, NodeX.
[04:38:45] <jhine> Here's what I'm trying to achieve, http://i56.tinypic.com/2h4dhlh.jpg - Obviously a different theme but the concept is there.
[04:39:23] <MaxMeents> http://jsfiddle.net/b5qPY/3/ - downloaded, installed pidgin so I could talk, simple enough question but I can't give a better example than this - hope someone can help see why current solution is not working
[04:40:19] <bjensen> are there jquery plugins that transforms your submit button of a form into a spinner ?
[04:41:18] <coldhead> to quote gandalf the wise, be the change you want to see in the world
[04:41:27] <coldhead> YOU make the submit a spinner
[04:41:30] <coldhead> YES YOU CAN
[04:41:35] <MaxMeents> LOL
[04:47:51] <Nomikos> Wasn't that Abraham Lincoln?
[04:51:04] <ThoMe> Nomikos: emm
[04:51:14] <ThoMe> $('#Umleitung').value.replace('/blub/','blah');
[04:51:17] <ThoMe> is this incorrect?
[04:51:27] <ThoMe> i would like change ithe input attribute in my input-field
[04:51:32] <jeffsmykil> I'm getting a strange error from this: room[room.length() + 1] = new facilities(registerRooms[y], null, null, null);
[04:51:41] <jeffsmykil> the error is this: TypeError: '7' is not a function (evaluating 'room.length()')
[04:52:31] <Nomikos> ThoMe: nearly there
[04:52:33] <ThoMe> Nomikos: $('#Umleitung').val().replace('/test/','blub');
[04:52:34] <ThoMe> hm
[04:52:39] <ThoMe> but doesnt works, also no error
[04:52:40] <Nomikos> even closer :-)
[04:52:49] <MaxMeents> is there anything to help you create buttons from oddly shaped graphics so that they run over smooth with the handlers?
[04:52:55] <Nomikos> it gets the value, and does the replace, but it doesn't update it in the field
[04:53:07] <ThoMe> Nomikos: can you help me? :-()
[04:53:10] <ThoMe> :-)
[04:53:24] <Nomikos> ThoMe: try $('#Umleitung').val($('#Umleitung').val().replace(/test/,'blub'));
[04:53:28] <jeffsmykil> if I add the semi colon i then get a syntax error
[04:53:54] <ThoMe> ah, works fine :-)
[04:54:04] <Nomikos> ThoMe: as you can see the val() get is nested in the val() set; also, regex requires no quotes around the pattern
[04:54:22] <ThoMe> ah ok
[04:54:50] <MaxMeents> I thought png's were supposed to do that
[04:55:29] <Nomikos> png has no special side effect, it's just an image format
[04:56:01] <guy> I have a problem with the following two methods. $(this).fadeTo(200, .8).animate({bottom: 130}, 200); Both are synchronous, therefore first it fades to, then it animates.
[04:56:10] <guy> is it possible to use fade in animate()?
[04:56:31] <guy> (CSS option 'opacity' is not cross-browser compatible and therefore not an option)
[04:56:46] <ThoMe> Nomikos: is it posible to check, if the use tipping  in the input field the sign "@" then replace to .. blbu
[04:56:49] <ThoMe> ?
[04:56:53] <skotsj> I've got a jquery selector in an js object, and i need to access a field of the object, but if i use "this.something" i access the jquery selected element, how do I avoid this ?
[04:57:08] <jeffsmykil> man it's busy in here this morning
[04:57:17] <Nomikos> ThoMe: should be, in the same way. is it not working?
[04:58:13] <ThoMe> Nomikos: works fine, thanks, i mean, i would like when the use tipping: thome@ then replace to thome@mail.de (mail.de is the default domain). he can change the domain
[04:58:19] <ThoMe> but default is always mail.de
[04:58:42] <ThoMe> i think i must check not when he tipping, only when tipping an @
[04:58:43] <ThoMe> hm?
[04:58:50] <Nomikos> ah, yes
[04:58:55] <guy> anyone>
[04:59:03] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7596983/animate-fadeto-both-synchronous
[04:59:10] <ThoMe> Nomikos: can you help me?
[05:00:45] <Nomikos> ThoMe: to see which character was typed (so you can check for it), you want to pass the event in your function, and .. do magic to it
[05:01:26] <Nomikos> it'll look like foo.keyup(function(event) { .. check if the event.keyCode is the code for '@' here, do something if it was
[05:02:07] <Nomikos> ThoMe: there's an example down the page at http://api.jquery.com/keyup/ that you can play with
[05:04:56] <jhine> http://meh.ltdev.im/~lustra/test.html - explains all.
[05:08:55] <Nomikos> guy: good one, can't figure it out :/ usually the problem is the other way round
[05:09:25] <guy> I know.
[05:09:43] <Nomikos> does http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2344804/how-can-i-execute-multiple-simultaneous-jquery-effects help?
[05:09:43] <guy> and, I also find it strange that first parameter in fadeTo is duration rather than opacity.
[05:09:56] <ravenzz> same
[05:10:19] <NodeX> I thought jquery normalised "opacity"
[05:10:38] <coldhead> it is backwards, guy
[05:10:45] <coldhead> even john resig admits it
[05:10:53] <coldhead> but what are you gonna do
[05:10:59] <coldhead> build your own library?
[05:11:04] <coldhead> with blackjacl?
[05:11:06] <coldhead> and hookers?
[05:11:10] <coldhead> i'd like to see that!
[05:11:12] <Nomikos> I'd use that
[05:11:26] <coldhead> me too, brother
[05:11:27] <coldhead> testify
[05:11:47] <coldhead> NodeX: it should...
[05:11:55] <domcat> what is wrong with this snippet? http://pastie.org/2610762 It changes the opacity to 0.7 when checked, but not change it back when not checked.
[05:11:55] <coldhead> it does, as far as i know
[05:12:06] <Genesis730> coldhead: you were the one I was talkin to earler?
[05:12:23] <NodeX> so the "opacity os not cross browser so is not an option" on guy's post is irrelevant
[05:12:30] <NodeX> os -> is
[05:12:58] <guy> Nomikos: why?
[05:13:03] <coldhead> Genesis730: we were talking about how we hadn't talked earlier, yes?
[05:13:12] <guy> Are you referring to: "13:10 NodeX: I thought jquery normalised "opacity""
[05:13:28] <coldhead> yes, jQuery makes opacity work across browsers
[05:13:28] <Genesis730> that you're new here
[05:13:34] <NodeX> guy : ... if jquery normmalises opacity to cross browser then just use opacity
[05:13:35] <guy> oh, I see.
[05:13:39] <coldhead> it stil doesn't work in CSS
[05:13:42] <NodeX> or opacity in animate
[05:13:45] <guy> NodeX: I misread that the first time.
[05:13:52] <domcat> any ideas why this not works http://pastie.org/2610762 ?
[05:14:14] <guy> though, I am pretty sure that animate({opacity: }) will still effect only CSS directly.
[05:14:21] <krad> is there an easy way to read a query string parameter's value from the URL?
[05:14:25] <guy> or so my tests show so far
[05:14:57] <NodeX> domcat: why so many calls to $(this) and we need to see your markup
[05:15:07] <Nomikos> domcat: it works for me, in a quick test
[05:15:17] <Nomikos> so it's not in that snippet
[05:15:47] <domcat> NodeX: what is wrong with this calls? here is the markup http://pastie.org/2610781
[05:15:56] <Nomikos> code != markup
[05:15:56] <skotsj> anyone able to help me with this "this" issue: http://jsfiddle.net/kMzCp/
[05:16:13] <Nomikos> ahrg. ignore that>.<
[05:16:14] <NodeX> domcat .. create a reference for $(this) and use it - it's far better
[05:16:29] <domcat> NodeX: better in - performancE?
[05:16:34] <NodeX> var element=$(this); .. if(element.is(""...
[05:16:49] <NodeX> better in performance, memory useage
[05:17:30] <Nomikos> domcat: I think it's because the change() event isn't triggered when the previous radio button loses it's "checked" status
[05:17:31] * NodeX wonders what is better $("#id input.class") or $("input.class",$("#id"))
[05:17:41] <atula> I like using var _self = $(this); heh
[05:17:51] <NodeX> domcat : use "click"
[05:18:19] <Nomikos> that still won't reset the previously clicked item, will it/
[05:18:23] <atula> NodeX: the second selector perform a .find
[05:18:29] <domcat> NodeX: click does the same
[05:18:33] <NodeX> i use "element" because it's faster!
[05:18:37] <NodeX> faster to type**
[05:18:37] <atula> generally the fastest is still input.class
[05:18:46] <domcat> if you meant to replace the change
[05:18:51] <NodeX> from what I read the "context" makes it faster
[05:18:56] <atula> it doesn't mattter... anything you're comfortable with is good, NodeX
[05:19:12] <Nomikos> domcat: set them all to opacity 1, and /then/ the clicked one to 0.7
[05:19:14] <NodeX> but then I thought how can it be if it's 2 init's and 2 dom lookups
[05:20:13] <NodeX> domcat : are you hoping to change them all .. because $(this) in that6 instance refers to the clicked element not the whole inpit.radio
[05:20:17] <NodeX> input.radio *
[05:20:50] <Nomikos> domcat: http://pastie.org/2610798
[05:20:52] <Nomikos> try that
[05:21:38] <Nomikos> and you can probably lose the else clause, since it'll never fire for radiobuttons
[05:21:47] <Nomikos> s/clause/branch/
[05:21:59] <Nomikos> (or whatever the technical phrase is :p)
[05:22:03] <domcat> :)
[05:22:04] <Genesis730> coldhead: about how you are new here and I mistook you for someone else I was trying to find :P
[05:22:30] <domcat> Nomikos it works, the last remaining thing is to have opacity 0.7 on the element that is checked by default
[05:23:15] <NodeX> do it on doc ready .. grab the list and see which one is checked and apply the opcity to it
[05:23:57] <jhine> Is there an 'insertAfter closest node'?
[05:24:07] <Nomikos> domcat: what NodeX said, or $('input.radio:checked').parent().css('opacity', 0.7);
[05:24:41] <NodeX> jhine .. $("selector").closest().insertAfter()
[05:24:48] <domcat> got it working, thanks guys
[05:25:18] <jhine> thanks NodeX
[05:27:03] <jeffsmykil> interesting im getting different erros from different consoles
[05:27:11] <jeffsmykil> and by interesting i mean annoying
[05:27:31] <Nomikos> The joys of webdev
[05:28:52] <jhine> Any reason why this isn't doing anything, NodeX, $(function() { $('td.c_info-r').closest('td.c_last').insertAfter('td.c_last'); });
[05:29:12] <jhine> I want it to take the 'replies' and put them after the cloest td.c_last
[05:29:22] <NodeX> can you pastebin your markup jhine?
[05:29:32] <ccmonsters> ?demo @ jhine
[05:29:32] <bot-t> jhine, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:30:16] <jhine> I made a live working example but it was poor. http://s1.zetaboards.com/James/index/ - is the forum url. would it be easier for me to upload the js to the forum or use console?
[05:32:23] <NodeX> I can't find the markup on the page soryr
[05:32:25] <ccmonsters> I'm not sure what 'replies' you are talking about on that example page.
[05:32:34] <NodeX> nor me ^^
[05:33:01] <jhine> http://i56.tinypic.com/2h4dhlh.jpg - This is what I'm trying to achieve.
[05:33:06] <ccmonsters> you got two people here in the early morning willing to help you man. So give us something and you are going to get help it seems.
[05:33:37] <ccmonsters> i like the original arrangement better :|
[05:34:11] <ccmonsters> And isn't that something you do with the PHP code, or whatever builds the pages?
[05:34:24] <NodeX> you have to remove some dom elements jhine to do that
[05:34:41] <jhine> I can't access the PHP code because it is hosted elsewhere. Just one of those free forums.
[05:35:00] <ccmonsters> well, you can probably achieve this with css, to be honest.
[05:35:19] <ccmonsters> You could do some display:none , and mangle it into place
[05:35:39] <jhine> o okay, i'll have a look. thanks :)
[05:36:32] <NodeX> or a mixture .. find your element and apply hide()
[05:36:48] <NodeX> reading and writing the nodes is a huge waste of memory :D
[05:36:59] <ccmonsters> it looks like I could just do a display none on td.c_info-v, td.c_info-t
[05:37:17] <NodeX> $('td.c_info-v, td.c_info-t').hide();
[05:38:01] <ccmonsters> yea, i'd just do it with CSS, and skip the JS processing
[05:38:02] <jhine> I'd need to remove the <tr> between td.c_last and td.c_info-r right?
[05:38:25] <jhine> Because I can't access that.
[05:38:30] <ccmonsters> display none on td.c_info-v, td.c_info-t, then width:100% on td.c_info-r and BAM, done
[05:38:59] <ccmonsters> you can't access the CSS?
[05:39:24] <ccmonsters> why are you using this forum software again? ?
[05:39:41] <jhine> I can access the CSS, not HTML and to put the c_info-r next to c_last id have to remove <tr>
[05:39:44] <skotsj> mordof: =)
[05:39:58] <ccmonsters> ok, if you can access the css, do what I showed you and it will work.
[05:40:04] <ccmonsters> you dont even have to mess with the JS then
[05:40:38] <jeffsmykil> it always amazes me that i can write one line of javascript that brings my quad core machine to its knees
[05:40:42] <mordof> skotsj: that's because the `this` inside the .click is the `this` that belongs to the event
[05:40:49] <mordof> skotsj: hold on, i'll update it to work
[05:40:52] <NodeX> lmfao @ jeffsmykil
[05:41:01] <skotsj> yea i know the problem i just couldn't figure out how to fix it
[05:41:05] <mordof> skotsj: http://jsfiddle.net/kMzCp/1/
[05:41:18] <mordof> skotsj: that should solve your issue
[05:41:57] <ccmonsters> gotta write better js lol jeffsmykil
[05:42:00] <skotsj> ok, i'll test it out
[05:42:02] <jhine> ccmonsters: okay, i've done that http://s1.zetaboards.com/James/index/ but the <tr> is stopping them being side by side.
[05:42:11] <jeffsmykil> ccmonsters: or get a faster machine!
[05:42:34] <ccmonsters> lol, quad core? you don't need a six-core for JS development haha
[05:42:37] <ccmonsters> but a nice thought! :)
[05:42:47] <jeffsmykil> I NEED MORE RAMMSSS
[05:42:48] <ccmonsters> so you want what side by side jhine ?
[05:43:01] <jhine> please :P
[05:43:01] <jeffsmykil> 3gb doesn't cut it on any platform anymore
[05:43:20] <ccmonsters> ha jeffsmykil , naw. 3gb is fine for js dev.
[05:43:31] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster i also do design
[05:43:34] <ccmonsters> it's all that OTHER shit you're running that brings it to it's knees
[05:43:39] <jeffsmykil> and I run OS X and Windows 7 side by side
[05:43:49] <ccmonsters> Well there's your issue, not the JS :)
[05:43:49] <ScottO_> how would i invalidate a field using the jquery validation plugin?
[05:43:51] <jeffsmykil> IN A VM
[05:43:56] <gnarf> mornin #jquery
[05:43:59] <jeffsmykil> no this was def the js lol
[05:44:01] <ccmonsters> follow the docs ScottO_
[05:44:09] <ccmonsters> morning gnarf
[05:44:10] <ScottO_> im trying to trigger a message when one of 2 fields is not filled
[05:44:16] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: invalidate is not an option
[05:44:18] <skotsj> ah yes mordof, works with that, I tried having this.me = this; but then i couldn't access "me" within the jquery
[05:44:21] <skotsj> thanks
[05:44:36] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: maybe you should listen before answering
[05:45:03] <jeffsmykil> I wish I could just communicate with the debugger, and convince it it's wrong, that the variable really does have a value if it looked harder
[05:45:04] <ccmonsters> there is a invalid class, use that, and do $('.mymessagefield').text(myMessage).show('slow') or something
[05:45:19] <ScottO_> oh so not even using the validation plugin for it
[05:45:19] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: :-)
[05:45:26] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: thats not in the docs :P
[05:45:41] <ccmonsters> you expect me to help out after that? ......
[05:45:42] <ScottO_> was hopuing i could trigger a message
[05:45:51] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: after what? honesty?
[05:46:07] <ScottO_> sorry you have an aversion to the truth
[05:46:07] <gnarf> ScottO_: you seriously giving someone shit for saying RTFM?
[05:46:09] <ccmonsters> nope, after you read the docs, apparently.
[05:46:18] <ScottO_> gnarf: especially when its not in the manual, yes
[05:46:23] <ScottO_> is there a problem with that?
[05:46:39] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: ive read the validation plugin docs many many times
[05:47:03] <Nomikos> Well, good luck fixing it :-)
[05:47:09] <jeffsmykil> ccmonsters: does this piece of totally out of context code look right to you?
[05:47:11] <jeffsmykil> ccmonsters: if ($.inArray((registerRooms[y], room[i]) == -1))
[05:47:12] <ScottO_> nowhere in those docs does it specify triggering an invalid field
[05:47:19] <ScottO_> Nomikos: fixing what?
[05:47:19] <gnarf> ScottO_: eh - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/showErrors#errors
[05:47:26] <gnarf> ScottO_: like that?
[05:47:27] <ScottO_> gnarf: thats to show the current errors
[05:47:35] <ccmonsters> Ok. Then you've not read enough of the docs, or comprehended enough. Almost positive it's there.
[05:47:36] <gnarf> so make a current error?
[05:47:42] <ScottO_> yep
[05:48:04] <ccmonsters> lol @ totally out of context code...why do you say that?
[05:48:05] <ScottO_> im using the submit handler to check 2 fields to make sure that at least one is filled out
[05:48:11] <jeffsmykil> AHA
[05:48:14] <jeffsmykil> IM MISSING A )
[05:48:19] <gnarf> ScottO_: .showErrors({ "fieldname": "error message" });
[05:48:21] <ccmonsters> ta-da!
[05:48:24] <ccmonsters> good eye :)
[05:48:24] <gnarf> according the the manual
[05:48:24] <ScottO_> and id like to use the validation plugin to do the message display
[05:48:25] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: debugger was right again?
[05:48:34] <Nomikos> or just misleading?
[05:48:58] <gnarf> ScottO_: i have to agree with ccmonsters here, RTFM :)
[05:49:03] <ccmonsters> gnarf...did you perhaps JUST put that in the manual!? Cmon now, you can admit it!...you pulled a fast one on ScottO_ , didn't you?
[05:49:06] <ScottO_> gnarf: "Show the specified messages." is misleading then
[05:49:19] <gnarf> ScottO_: bullshit, its called "showErrors"
[05:49:24] <gnarf> ScottO_: that sounds like the method you want
[05:49:25] <NodeX> hahahahaha
[05:49:25] <jo_> +1
[05:49:26] <mordof> skotsj: be careful when you use `this` - the scope is only of the current object you're in
[05:49:30] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: i dnot want to show all the errors
[05:49:32] <mordof> skotsj: as soon as you jump scope it changes
[05:49:32] <gnarf> ScottO_: totally deserves a "full read"
[05:49:41] <jo_> hello
[05:49:48] <mordof> skotsj: are you familiar with the scope rules of javascript?
[05:49:52] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: and besides, since when is rtfm not a dickish anser?
[05:49:56] <ScottO_> *answer
[05:50:02] <jo_> could this work ?
[05:50:02] <jo_> $("#content").load("index.htm");  $("#Title").load("index.htm");  $("#Link").load("index.htm");  var str = $(#Title).text();  var str = $(#Link).text();  $("#content").append('<a class="example6 cboxElement" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/617ANIA5Rqs?rel=0&wmode=transparent" title="Title</a>');
[05:50:11] <ScottO_> :P
[05:50:12] <pachet> since they published the manual
[05:50:12] <gnarf> ScottO_: so you expect him to RTFM for you?
[05:50:13] <ccmonsters> i didn't even say, RTFM. Actually i said that it's in the docs.
[05:50:20] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: same thing
[05:50:25] <gnarf> ScottO_: he was much more polite about it
[05:50:36] <jo_> ?car
[05:50:38] <ccmonsters> ^ exactly.
[05:50:41] <bot-t> jo_, Jetinject | jQuery Plugins - Jetinject is a very small jQuery plugin that enables simple dependency injection in object oriented JavaScript solutions. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jetinject
[05:50:51] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: yes and im on freenode, but that doesnt specify where on freenode does it?
[05:51:08] <jo_> ?1
[05:51:09] <bot-t> [#1] SPAM (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/1
[05:51:26] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos if it would just hear my side of the argument I would be more open to it being right
[05:51:40] <ScottO_> its liek when i ask my gf for her keys, and she says "they are in the house"
[05:51:43] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: leave it a message in the comments
[05:52:06] <ccmonsters> ScottO_: i was more than polite about it. I merely said that it's in the docs in case you might have thought it wasn't, or it wasn't where you thought it should be.
[05:52:11] <ccmonsters> And i'm not your gf.
[05:52:13] <ScottO_> i didnt thinkit wasnt
[05:52:14] <jo_> ?jquery validate
[05:52:14] <gnarf> ScottO_: so now that I've read the manual and proved that there was the answer you were looking for, I think you owe ccmonsters an apology, jerk....
[05:52:15] <bot-t> jo_, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[05:52:19] <ScottO_> and i didnt NOT read the docs
[05:52:29] <ScottO_> its was merley a misinterpretation
[05:52:35] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: some day someone is going to make a JS debugger that doesn't suck, and make MIIIIILLIONS of dollars
[05:52:41] <gnarf> :)
[05:52:42] <ScottO_> gnarf: im the jerk?
[05:52:45] <ScottO_> lol
[05:52:45] <Nomikos> That'll be the day
[05:52:55] <ccmonsters> well, I can clearly say that I did not misinterpret your remarks.
[05:53:01] <jo_> ?
[05:53:04] <gnarf> ScottO_: in this case? yeah -
[05:53:05] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: you assumed i didnt read at all
[05:53:06] <ccmonsters> And yet YOU are the one asking ME for help.
[05:53:06] <gnarf> ccmonsters: maybe you should listen before answering
[05:53:13] <jo_> could it work
[05:53:19] <jo_> ?will it work?
[05:53:20] <bot-t> jo_, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:53:26] <ScottO_> what do assumptions do?
[05:53:27] <gnarf> that was a quote btw there ScottO_
[05:54:11] <ccmonsters> ScottO_: you were helped. Kill it. I never said anything directly negative to you. yet you sniped at me directly. Move along unless you have another issue, in which case someone will help you.
[05:54:18] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: jslint is wonderful, if you can integrate it with your editor somehow
[05:54:22] <jo_> ?assumptions
[05:54:30] <jeffsmykil> anyone have a link for error^2 i cant find it in the addons section
[05:54:30] <bot-t> jo_, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[05:54:58] <jo_> does jslint work with jslint?
[05:54:59] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: ok it seems youve spend too much time in here. seem to think short curt answers that point to the docs are acceptable
[05:55:03] <jo_> sry
[05:55:09] <jo_> does jquery work with jslint
[05:55:14] <Nomikos> ScottO_: give it a rest already
[05:55:26] <ScottO_> Nomikos: why do i have to be the one to give it a rest
[05:55:30] <Nomikos> jo_: well, jQuery is JavaScript, so yes
[05:55:53] <jo_> $("#content").load("index.htm");  $("#Title").load("index.htm");  $("#Link").load("index.htm");  var str = $(#Title).text();  var str = $(#Link).text();  $("#content").append('<a class="example6 cboxElement" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/617ANIA5Rqs?rel=0&wmode=transparent" title="Title</a>'); will it work?
[05:56:03] <jeffsmykil> fighting on the internet is pointless
[05:56:06] <gnarf> ScottO_: i think they are perfectly acceptable, when they are right, and you are wrong
[05:56:07] <Nomikos> ScottO_: because you're older and wiser
[05:56:11] <Nomikos> Right?
[05:56:13] <ScottO_> Nomikos: am i?
[05:56:13] <jeffsmykil> if you disagree just dont talk to one another
[05:56:22] <Nomikos> Right.
[05:56:30] <jeffsmykil> am i showing my age?
[05:56:33] <Nomikos> (besides, you were being a dick about it)
[05:56:39] <ScottO_> Nomikos: meaning both sides, not jst one
[05:56:51] <gnarf> you started the dickwaving
[05:56:54] <gnarf> im just waving it back
[05:56:55] <gnarf> :)
[05:56:59] <NodeX> ScottO_ : this is a help chan for a "free" piece of software where people donate their time to help others out .. if you don't want to use someone's help/advice then /ignore
[05:57:03] <pachet> *yawn*
[05:57:05] <jeffsmykil> ScottO_: if you want to see some real dick heads try #css!
[05:57:17] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: try #mysql
[05:57:18] <Nomikos> oh, oh, or #web, they're wonderfully mature
[05:57:22] <ccmonsters> lol
[05:57:40] <NodeX> or ##php lol
[05:58:00] <jeffsmykil> i really think #css might be the worst
[05:58:13] <NodeX> I've never been in there lol
[05:58:28] <jeffsmykil> it's awful
[05:58:35] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: itsnot that bad
[05:58:43] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: what did you do ti set them off?
[05:58:47] <ccmonsters> it's far worse than this. promise.
[05:58:57] <jeffsmykil> I think I entered the room
[05:58:59] <jeffsmykil> IM not sure though
[05:59:02] <ScottO_> haha
[05:59:02] <ccmonsters> lol jeffsmykil ha
[05:59:06] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: ah. bad move.
[05:59:12] <ccmonsters> maybe it depends on the time of the month
[05:59:13] <ccmonsters> :|
[05:59:14] <jeffsmykil> and believe me as far as dick heads in here go ccmonsters is really low on the list
[05:59:20] <ScottO_> arent a lot of jquery peeps also in #css?
[05:59:42] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: well different things trigger for different people
[05:59:56] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: a dick is in the eye of the beholder
[05:59:57] <gnarf> 1.7 beta btw people
[05:59:57] <ccmonsters> i'm probably far more chatty and conversational than most. I do very little arguing. It's not worth my time.
[06:00:00] <gnarf> check it out
[06:00:01] <ccmonsters> OooOOoh
[06:00:11] <gnarf> im out for a bit, gotta head into work
[06:00:15] <ccmonsters> ScottO_: i need to tell my gf that :)
[06:00:16] <jeffsmykil> i think i know a dick when i see one
[06:00:35] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: im sorry i felt you were being a dick to me, i may have been too sensitive
[06:00:42] <ccmonsters> is that so jeffsmykil lol...
[06:00:53] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: typically you hear dicks
[06:00:54] <jeffsmykil> ScottO_:  its easy to get frustrated and feel like someone is being a jerk
[06:00:55] <jhine> ccmonsters, I've taken the jQuery approach because I can't remove the </tr> required so I'm using this: $(function() {  $('td.c_info-t, td.c_info-v').css('display', 'none');  $('td.c_info-r').insertAfter('td.c_last'); });   - however, it's copying all the replies forum all forums shown in this example: http://s1.zetaboards.com/James/index/
[06:00:56] <ccmonsters> it's not a problem. over it.
[06:01:08] <ScottO_> can someone look like a dick?
[06:01:25] <ccmonsters> yes, but typically they are bald, and wrinkly.
[06:01:29] <Nomikos> There are costumes. I think they're offtopic though >.>
[06:01:48] <jeffsmykil> is anyone using jslint with a mac?
[06:01:52] <Tudrum> hi all
[06:02:02] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: yeah, bundle for TextMate
[06:02:13] <ccmonsters> blah. I use eclipse/aptana plugin.
[06:02:17] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: eww
[06:02:18] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: is it idiot proof to install?
[06:02:35] <ccmonsters> but then again I have to do Java and what not all the time so it's easier to just have one IDE
[06:02:35] <Tudrum> i have a question about .outerHeight()
[06:02:39] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: it's uh.. been a while. I think it's download and doubleclick
[06:02:53] <ccmonsters> Eclipse/Aptana is actually quite nice.
[06:03:01] <ccmonsters> Just gotta customize it.
[06:03:11] <jeffsmykil> i think my eclipse liscense ran out
[06:03:13] <ccmonsters> which is a pain the first time around.
[06:03:19] <ccmonsters> eclipse is free.99
[06:03:29] <jeffsmykil> wait is that the java one>
[06:03:36] <ccmonsters> open source motherfuckers :)
[06:03:51] <ccmonsters> it was originally a java IDE, yes.
[06:03:57] <jeffsmykil> i use textedit++ on pc
[06:04:00] <jeffsmykil> which is the win
[06:04:02] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: try https://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle
[06:04:02] <NodeX> jhine: without seeing the markup in a pastebin I dont think you will get much help
[06:04:04] <CantUnplug> or netbeans
[06:04:12] <Tudrum> im trying to .append() some html to div and then im trying to get .outerHeight() of appended element but it only returns height of element qitout border and padding
[06:04:12] <NodeX> notepad++ ftw
[06:04:14] <ccmonsters> I've got notepad ++ somewhere
[06:04:23] <jeffsmykil> thats what im eant notepad++
[06:04:26] <jeffsmykil> im a fan
[06:04:30] <ccmonsters> notepad++ is solid.
[06:04:35] <ccmonsters> But Eclipse gives me so much more.
[06:04:46] <torbjorn> I typically use notepad++ when on windows
[06:04:54] <ccmonsters> then again i do svn/git/jira tracking in there.
[06:04:59] <NodeX> I had to learn java for an Android app :(
[06:05:07] <jeffsmykil> ugh we use turtle svn its aswful
[06:05:11] <ccmonsters> and when I have to go into java it's very handy
[06:05:11] <NodeX> had -> has
[06:05:14] <blackspotwiggins> tortoisesvn
[06:05:22] <Tudrum> how can i try to force jquery to apply css to newly appended html?
[06:05:23] <jeffsmykil> yeah what ever its called
[06:05:27] <ccmonsters> tortoisesvn is decent for a shell svn client on windows
[06:05:28] <jeffsmykil> little turtle for a logo blackspotwiggins
[06:05:35] <NodeX> Tudrum : select it
[06:05:45] <Tudrum> how?
[06:05:51] <Nomikos> Tudrum: maybe you want .live() ?
[06:05:54] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, so we call things by their logos now? :)
[06:05:54] <juha_> we print out every codechange and then we archive it in our company library.
[06:05:57] <ccmonsters> I use subclipse on eclipse. It's quite nice
[06:06:08] <aaronmcadam> a tortoise is a turtle
[06:06:12] <blackspotwiggins> the big white f on blue think
[06:06:12] <ccmonsters> that's different juha_
[06:06:16] <blackspotwiggins> thing*
[06:06:17] <NodeX> $('<p></p>').attr("id","foo").appendTo('body'); .... $("#foo").css()
[06:06:18] <aaronmcadam> I use pycharm, based on eclipse
[06:06:18] <jeffsmykil> there are some nice svn clients for mac
[06:06:22] <jeffsmykil> Versions is really nice
[06:06:27] <ccmonsters> haven't used pycharm.
[06:06:31] <aaronmcadam> it's awesome
[06:06:36] <aaronmcadam> if you've got the memory
[06:06:44] <blackspotwiggins> the tragedy of svn is their lack of branches
[06:06:48] <juha_> ccmonsters: if i need to revert, i go and get the old print, then rewrite the code based on that
[06:06:50] <ccmonsters> versions is nice. my coworker uses versions, and bbedit lol
[06:06:59] <jeffsmykil> i use textwrangler lol
[06:07:02] <jeffsmykil> because its free
[06:07:05] <ccmonsters> that's very, very, unique juha_
[06:07:08] <jeffsmykil> and my work is cheap
[06:07:09] <NodeX> ms wordpad ftw
[06:07:11] <NodeX> lmfao
[06:07:11] <Nomikos> textwrangler beats TM for large logfiles
[06:07:12] <ccmonsters> ha
[06:07:21] <ccmonsters> notepad! not wordpad
[06:07:22] <ccmonsters> :)
[06:07:29] <jeffsmykil> i cant get more ram ffs
[06:07:33] <blackspotwiggins> sublime text 2, try it
[06:07:35] <jeffsmykil> and I run two OS all the time
[06:07:38] <ccmonsters> Textmate is horrible for large files right? isn't it terribly slow?
[06:07:43] <CantUnplug> no
[06:07:45] <NodeX> reason number 99 why macs blow horse c**k
[06:07:46] <ccmonsters> or is that Coda I am thinking of.
[06:07:53] <CantUnplug> checkout Kod for mac too.. simple free for big files
[06:08:03] <jeffsmykil> coda is decent , havent tried it for big files though
[06:08:09] <Nomikos> ccmonsters: it's bad, yes. But by the time your code files are large enough for TM to have trouble with it, you should probably be splitting them up anyway
[06:08:14] <ccmonsters> Back in the day I ran some komodoEdit too. Which honestly was quite solid
[06:08:19] <Nomikos> ccmonsters: or .. did you say you wrote Java? :)
[06:08:28] <ccmonsters> I do write java, why?
[06:08:34] <orl> Hi guys!
[06:08:36] <aaronmcadam> you need hugs :)
[06:08:39] <Nomikos> large files, I guess :p
[06:08:47] <ccmonsters> Naw, the files don't get too large.
[06:08:48] <jeffsmykil> ooh kod looks interesting
[06:08:53] <jeffsmykil> who recomended this?
[06:08:56] <aaronmcadam> gedit :D
[06:08:57] <CantUnplug> me
[06:08:59] <pachet> eclipse or bust
[06:08:59] <pachet> ;o
[06:09:14] <jeffsmykil> CantUnplug: this have jslint pligin?
[06:09:14] * CantUnplug recommends kod.. for now
[06:09:17] <ccmonsters> eclipse is bueno
[06:09:25] <orl> Take a look here: http://www.sebkhachott.net/spip/?article30, and then just try to go to another page ot that website (using that big circle on the left)
[06:09:26] <jeffsmykil> if you arent coding in pico you aren't coding
[06:09:26] <Nomikos> TextMate said to be releasing an alpha before Christmas, fwiw
[06:09:31] <ccmonsters> komodoedit might be my backup for web languages
[06:09:39] <ccmonsters> VIM
[06:09:44] <ccmonsters> fuck pico, i want shortcuts :)
[06:09:46] <CantUnplug> i use Espresso not for 99% - textmate just out of habit
[06:09:47] <ccmonsters> emacs baby!
[06:09:53] <NodeX> nano ftw
[06:09:59] <CantUnplug> kod is cool free one i found - handles huge files nicely
[06:09:59] <NodeX> nano-light ftw
[06:10:00] <CantUnplug> and fast
[06:10:03] <jeffsmykil> although I use lynx for website debugging
[06:10:07] <ccmonsters> i love nano actually
[06:10:12] <jeffsmykil> CantUnplug: can it do jslint?
[06:10:19] <orl> I'm using $.ajax() for the navigation, and get that weird thing: when coming *from* a page containing many media (<video> <audio>), the load of the next page is very long (~ 60s)
[06:10:22] <ccmonsters> ctrl+O , ctrl+x all day
[06:10:22] <aaronmcadam> cloud9 :D
[06:10:24] <whateverb> how can I get this slider to work no matter how many slide boxes there are? http://jsfiddle.net/PnRVe/
[06:10:25] <NodeX> I hate every linux editor except nano
[06:10:30] <ccmonsters> i havent tried cloud9 yet
[06:10:34] <NodeX> nano is super fast
[06:10:42] <aaronmcadam> gedit is great when u install the plugins
[06:10:47] <ccmonsters> i think i signed up, but havent messed with it
[06:10:52] <orl> emacs is great when you believe
[06:10:55] <jeffsmykil> i love conversations like this, my day goes so much faster and i get no work done
[06:10:57] <aaronmcadam> I keep meaning to set it up locally
[06:11:00] <NodeX> I nver use linux in a GUI env
[06:11:03] <ccmonsters> i love gedit on linux
[06:11:06] <ccmonsters> quick, out of the box.
[06:11:07] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[06:11:08] <ccmonsters> or GEANY
[06:11:16] <aaronmcadam> it's quick even with plugins
[06:11:19] <NodeX> I used kedit before .. and kate? is it
[06:11:23] <jeffsmykil> remember smultron?
[06:11:26] <jeffsmykil> for mac
[06:11:27] <jeffsmykil> oh man
[06:11:27] <aaronmcadam> i liked kate ages ago
[06:11:28] <ccmonsters> kate is solid on kde
[06:11:34] <ccmonsters> but geany beats it
[06:11:42] <aaronmcadam> but now i don't want the kde packages
[06:11:43] <CantUnplug> effsmykil - don't think so..
[06:11:48] <CantUnplug> maybe a sugar for it.
[06:11:50] <ccmonsters> kate is like notepad+, geany is like notepad++
[06:11:51] <ccmonsters> :)
[06:11:52] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: that's ages ago :D
[06:11:57] <jeffsmykil> IM OLD
[06:12:02] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: subethaedit?
[06:12:05] <NodeX> tbh I thought myself in dreamweaver and only use the code view and I don't mind it at all
[06:12:06] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: ed?
[06:12:07] <jeffsmykil> ive  been using OS X since like the PR
[06:12:07] <aaronmcadam> :D
[06:12:10] <Nomikos> don't worry, I'm probably older :-p
[06:12:15] <NodeX> nice and easy fopr development
[06:12:19] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: that was fun
[06:12:20] <ccmonsters> go kill yourself NodeX  :)
[06:12:26] <ccmonsters> you've gone to the dark side
[06:12:30] <ccmonsters> save yourself
[06:12:30] <CantUnplug> subethaedit wow.. that brings it back.. pair programming over bonjour ftw
[06:12:32] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: remember MacOS 7.5.3r2?
[06:12:35] <NodeX> each to thier own :)
[06:12:40] <aaronmcadam> ed!
[06:12:42] <aaronmcadam> aha
[06:12:47] <ccmonsters> if you like dreamweaver, use Eclipse.
[06:12:50] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: ran it on my 6400 bitch!
[06:12:53] <pachet> does dreamweaver still do that thing
[06:12:54] <Nomikos> haha
[06:12:58] <NodeX> I can't get on with it and it's eats my ram
[06:13:00] <ccmonsters> the combo view?
[06:13:03] <pachet> where it wont remove the syntax error coloring until you click out
[06:13:23] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: I have a MacTV in my closet!
[06:13:24] <NodeX> I use codeview and nothing else .. I just like the way it shows the code and the font's / colors it uses
[06:13:31] <Tudrum> i still dont get it, what do you mean by "select it" ? im appending '<ul id=someid'></ul>' and then $('#someid').outerHeight() dont get border from css file
[06:13:38] <ScottO_> :( cant call showErrors from inside the submitHandler...
[06:13:40] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: aren't those.. recent?
[06:13:44] <jeffsmykil> NO
[06:13:44] <NodeX> the FTP manager comes in handy from time to time
[06:13:47] <jeffsmykil> THE MacTV
[06:13:52] <jeffsmykil> the one that ran 7.5
[06:13:55] <jeffsmykil> it had a tv tuner
[06:13:58] <jeffsmykil> only 10k ever made
[06:14:03] <jeffsmykil> released mostly in japan
[06:14:04] <Nomikos> oh.. hmmm.. haven't heard of it
[06:14:15] <NodeX> Tudrum :@ check the docs on outerHeight();
[06:14:16] <jeffsmykil> its basically a performa painted black with a tv tuner
[06:14:19] <Nomikos> I know the 5400 had an optional tv card
[06:14:29] <Nomikos> yeah, that one
[06:14:33] <aaronmcadam> ?outerHeight @ Tudrum
[06:14:33] <bot-t> Tudrum, .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[06:14:47] <ccmonsters> Download Aptana NodeX . If you like dreamweaver, it's got the dreamweaver syntax hilighting and coloring, but much better
[06:14:52] <ccmonsters> it's a step in the right direction.
[06:15:08] <aaronmcadam> i didn't really like aptana 3 tho
[06:15:09] <blackspotwiggins> every ide that runs on java is slow
[06:15:13] <aaronmcadam> they removed a lot
[06:15:15] <NodeX> I might try it ... I've been using DW for 10+ years or however long it's been out and can get round it mega fast
[06:15:19] <blackspotwiggins> including eclipse, aptana, jetbrains, netbeans
[06:15:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah blackspotwiggins, but if you've got the ram
[06:15:26] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: I also have a prototype Apple STB in my closet
[06:15:30] <blackspotwiggins> i got the ram
[06:15:32] <blackspotwiggins> it's still slow
[06:15:35] <ccmonsters> lol
[06:15:37] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/computers/mactv.html
[06:15:42] <aaronmcadam> pycharm on my 8gig i5 machine is fast as fuck
[06:15:48] <ccmonsters> haha
[06:15:50] <blackspotwiggins> changing tabs takes multiple seconds
[06:15:51] <blackspotwiggins> not usable
[06:15:56] <ccmonsters> My work laptop isn't that beastly, and it works fine
[06:15:57] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: ok ok you win :)
[06:16:02] <aaronmcadam> not seen that myself
[06:16:05] <jeffsmykil> danm right SON
[06:16:08] <ccmonsters> my home machine is a BEAST, and it flys
[06:16:14] <Nomikos> I'm sitting next to a Mac Classic but it ain't mine..
[06:16:30] <NodeX> ccmonsters : does it use redbull heat compound ? :P
[06:16:38] <blackspotwiggins> having tons of ram does not make things magically fast
[06:16:50] <ccmonsters> aaronmcadam: i sort of agree on the Aptana3. They moved shit around. i think it will be a few months till they have all the old fans happy and give them the features they really miss.
[06:16:55] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: I respectfully disagree
[06:17:00] <ccmonsters> :)
[06:17:07] <orl> OK, guys, does anybody have an idea about the problem I talk about a bit before
[06:17:08] <Tudrum> i know how outerheight is working, after resizing div in some nexy sunsequend call outerHeight is working fine for me, it is not working fine only after .append()
[06:17:10] <NodeX> if your env is full of crap then it will not be fast no matter what
[06:17:11] <ccmonsters> yes, i used that as my CPU compound.
[06:17:14] <jeffsmykil> Nomikos: I have a mac classic that's a fish tank!
[06:17:15] <ccmonsters> :)
[06:17:20] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, so you are one of those people who buys 2gb geforce 6200 and thinks its the best gpu ever?
[06:17:21] <aaronmcadam> i did like the git integration ccmonsters
[06:17:36] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: my macpro has a 1gb gpu
[06:17:36] <ccmonsters> Yes. they throught that in there quite nicely.
[06:17:38] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: has no method 'showErrors'
[06:17:42] <NodeX> Tudrum : it's because it's asynch .. you need to defer
[06:17:44] <ScottO_> not sure why its behaving this way
[06:17:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:17:46] <jeffsmykil> and im pushing two cinema displays
[06:17:53] <NodeX> or callback after append (if it supports it(
[06:17:56] <ccmonsters> I personally prefer Eclipse 3.7 with the Aptana plugin instead of the aptana stand-alone
[06:18:04] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, and i have a bag of potatoes, so what?
[06:18:08] <ccmonsters> lol
[06:18:11] <ccmonsters> snap son!
[06:18:23] <jeffsmykil> i dont know i have no ram so i just wanted to brag about my work setup :-p
[06:18:24] <ccmonsters> ScottO_: you got a demo"?
[06:18:34] <jeffsmykil> my four year old home setup has more ram then my quad core mac pro at work
[06:18:56] <Tudrum> .append() doesn't have any callbacks
[06:18:57] <CantUnplug> wow.. i dont keep a computer more than a year or two.. i just got a quad i7 with 8gigs
[06:18:58] <blackspotwiggins> that's like saying the amount of wheels a car has indicates how fast it is
[06:19:00] <ccmonsters> I wouldn't mind a brand new mac pro at work.
[06:19:04] <ccmonsters> just for the hardware
[06:19:07] <whateverb> how can I get this slider to work no matter how many slide boxes there are? http://jsfiddle.net/PnRVe/
[06:19:14] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: my car has 13 wheels, it's wicked fast
[06:19:28] <ccmonsters> mines got 4 engines. one per wheel.
[06:19:31] <NodeX> for the money a MAC costs you can build a PC 5 times better performing
[06:19:43] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: dont start a flame war
[06:19:43] <CantUnplug> NodeX..  um.. no you cant
[06:19:44] <NodeX> I realy don't get why (apart from the look) people buy macs
[06:20:01] <jeffsmykil> who ever recomended Kod recomended an app with no code folding
[06:20:02] <CantUnplug> i can built a crap go-kart, but id rather buy a porsche that just works
[06:20:02] <jeffsmykil> YOU LOSE
[06:20:03] <kborchers> whateverb: this only goes in one direction but should get you going http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/PnRVe/9/
[06:20:06] <ccmonsters> whateverb: you dont need live because you aren't creating dom elements, according to that demo
[06:20:13] <kborchers> also, you should think about using delegate instead of live
[06:20:18] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[06:20:23] <NodeX> do MAC's run the worlds servers ... no lol
[06:20:27] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:20:35] <ScottO_> whats the proper format for an object again?
[06:20:36] <blackspotwiggins> ?cc
[06:20:37] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[06:20:38] <pachet> another educational day in #jq
[06:20:41] <orl> NodeX: was that sentence destined to15:17 < NodeX> if your env is full of crap then it will not be fast no matter what me:
[06:20:50] <orl> destined to me (sorry)
[06:20:52] <ScottO_> i swore it was {"":"","":""}
[06:20:54] <Xotix> hi, which jquery ui components would you use for that. You have list A and list b. You can copy elements from A to list b but not vice versa. List A is not sortable but list b is. List b elements are deletable but not list A. List a is like a bunch of elements and list b like a container.
[06:20:54] <NodeX> no m8
[06:21:05] <NodeX> it was on the "if you have enough ram your machine will be fast"
[06:21:07] <jeffsmykil> ok I don't care if you hate Apple kit, but for the love of God NodeX don't say MAC's it makes you look ignorant
[06:21:07] <ccmonsters> it all depends ScottO_ , what sort of object
[06:21:07] <whateverb> thanks kborchers, but how can it move back when I click item on the left?
[06:21:19] <Nomikos> ScottO_: looks good, yeah. throw a typeof at it?
[06:21:22] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: the one im supposed to be supplying ti showErrors
[06:21:32] <NodeX> jeffsmykil : I don't hate them, I just don't understand why people waste the money
[06:21:32] <ScottO_> im gettign type errors with that format
[06:21:33] <CantUnplug> i didnt say Kod was best of best.. or for code.. i said for large files.. and its free.
[06:21:34] <ccmonsters> ah, I haven't been looking at it.
[06:21:40] <ScottO_> uincaught type errors
[06:21:50] <jeffsmykil> understand first NodeX that it is not an acronymn
[06:21:56] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: I like the OS
[06:21:58] <NodeX> I used MAC's for my sound engineering degree for 5 years and they do a good job .. but they are sooo expensive
[06:21:59] <ccmonsters> ?demo @ ScottO_
[06:21:59] <bot-t> ScottO_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:22:01] <kborchers> whateverb: you'll need to play with the math using the elements' indexes to calculate which direction to go probably
[06:22:03] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/showErrors#errors
[06:22:20] <NodeX> Lets be honest until a linux underpin mac OS was badddd
[06:22:29] <jeffsmykil> i still used it
[06:22:29] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, stop now
[06:22:30] <jeffsmykil> heh
[06:22:32] <ScottO_> Nomikos: Horrible
[06:22:37] <orl> NodeX: Actually I'm teaching sound ingeneers how to use GNU/Linux for audio production
[06:22:41] <ScottO_> Nomikos: bad is an understatement
[06:22:42] <Nomikos> ScottO_: .. what?
[06:22:47] <NodeX> orl : nice
[06:22:48] <jeffsmykil> ccmonsters: where is my syntax error?  if ($.inArray((registerRooms[y]), room[i]) == -1)) {	
[06:22:49] <orl> no waste of money/time anymore, and so better and modular solutions
[06:22:56] <Nomikos> ScottO_: oh, you're talking to NodeX
[06:23:05] <ScottO_> oh lol
[06:23:06] <NodeX> plus you can write pretty much anything you need with the libs available]
[06:23:08] <ccmonsters> I will be back shortly guys. i have a doctors appt. Gotta do the ol' turn and cough bit.
[06:23:12] <ccmonsters> catch you guys in a bit
[06:23:19] <jeffsmykil> think of me
[06:23:19] <NodeX> enjoy
[06:23:25] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: dont bend over!
[06:23:33] <whateverb> kborchers, can you give me an example to learn from that?
[06:23:34] <Nomikos> Stay classy..
[06:23:34] <ccmonsters> Turning only, no bending.
[06:23:35] <jeffsmykil> pachet: if ($.inArray((registerRooms[y]), room[i]) == -1)) {	 syntax error?
[06:23:37] <orl> OK, got to go
[06:23:38] * ccmonsters crosses self
[06:23:42] <NodeX> some people get so defensive over MAC/PC .. it's like religion lol
[06:23:47] <orl> if someone has got some times to take a look at what I told before
[06:23:49] <jeffsmykil> ITS NOT MAC
[06:23:55] <jeffsmykil> its Mac for the love of god Mac
[06:24:03] <ccmonsters> NeXt
[06:24:04] <orl> www.sebkhachott.net/spip?article30
[06:24:14] <NodeX> it's w/e I wanna write seeint as I have freedom of speech :P
[06:24:15] <ScottO_> isnt it an apple?
[06:24:16] <orl> and just try to navigate through the website
[06:24:17] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, and it's not based on linux. i agree with what you are saying, but try to sound plausible at least
[06:24:17] <NodeX> seeing *
[06:24:19] <Nomikos> jeffsmykil: one ) too many
[06:24:20] <ScottO_> the OS is mac
[06:24:24] <jeffsmykil> and Mac isn't even the name of the company
[06:24:26] <jeffsmykil> its Apple
[06:24:30] <ccmonsters> it's based on bsd, i believe
[06:24:31] <ScottO_> you can have a mac with ubuntu
[06:24:38] <ScottO_> err i mean an apple with ubuntu
[06:24:46] <CantUnplug> NodeX - not flaming.. and not defensive.. but if you can build a 17" quad i7 with 8 gigs ram, in a 1inch form factor with 10 hour battery life that looks as sexy as my macbook pro.. ill buy it
[06:24:52] <NodeX> mac = faster to type and you all know what I mean when I say it lol
[06:25:04] <jeffsmykil> when i run ubuntu in vmware it doesnt fill the screen and it pisses me off
[06:25:08] <ccmonsters> which was the basis for the NeXt OS that Jobs worked on after getting canned at Apple. it later became the foundation for MacOS. That was what I've always thought, but could be wrong
[06:25:09] <Nomikos> Guys, guys,   ---------> #hardware, #OS
[06:25:17] <NodeX> CantUnplug : I didn't deny that they look good ... just very expensive
[06:25:19] <jeffsmykil> it was bsd
[06:25:23] <ccmonsters> that's a vmware thing. Guest additions and some other shit fixes that, i think
[06:25:23] <jeffsmykil> more specifically darwin
[06:25:23] <ScottO_> NodeX: i love apple fanboys
[06:25:34] <NodeX> hehe
[06:25:39] <juha_> please, poor people, get off my intertubes
[06:25:46] <CantUnplug> i prefer o have a linux laptop.. but i dotn want to carry a plastic brick around that lasts 2 hours
[06:26:01] <ccmonsters> and ive never owned a mac. make great hardware and have awesome ideas. Hate their psychology and there approach at times. Mostly hate the price gauging.
[06:26:07] <kborchers> whateverb: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/PnRVe/13/
[06:26:14] <krad> how to parse 2011-09-29T00:00:00Z to javascript Date?
[06:26:17] <NodeX> my HP 17" 6gb ram lasts about 5 hours and was 1/4 of the price of a macbook - or is is APPLEbook
[06:26:21] <NodeX> haha
[06:26:22] <krad> does jquery help with date conversion?
[06:26:33] <ccmonsters> yes there are date format handlers.
[06:26:42] <krad> url ?
[06:26:42] <ccmonsters> i think they can be found somewhere around the datepicker piece
[06:26:45] <ScottO_> NodeX: not to mention the hardware is cheaper to replace
[06:26:54] <krad> ccmonsters, those are part of a plugin or?
[06:27:05] <ScottO_> ccmonsters: dont you have somewhere to be?
[06:27:06] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: and like 3 times thicker and heavier?
[06:27:11] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: and made out of cheap plastic
[06:27:20] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: and doesnt have an ips screen?
[06:27:23] <NodeX> it's 1.5 inches
[06:27:35] <NodeX> yes but I dont care about all that stuff
[06:27:36] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: i serisouly doubt theres that big of a gap in laptop technology in general
[06:27:46] <NodeX> I care about teh 1500 I just saved and can now go on vacation
[06:27:53] <jeffsmykil> nope thats why the little things matter
[06:27:55] <ScottO_> if apple can do it, then anyone else can too
[06:28:10] <jeffsmykil> then why arent they?
[06:28:18] <ScottO_> maybe you arent l;ooking hard enough
[06:28:22] <ScottO_> or not at all
[06:28:36] <xec> hi guys, i'm trying my hand at creating a custom jquery plugin, and got it working locally, but not in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hf9pf/2/
[06:28:39] <NodeX> because the market for pretencious computer buyers is only so big hahahahaah
[06:28:46] <NodeX> Just Kidding before you all cry
[06:28:49] <troubleman> sup yall
[06:28:51] <xec> it is supposed to hide the bullet list
[06:28:53] <CantUnplug> best attempt i saw were the dell adamo's and they got rid of the super thin ones
[06:28:56] <ScottO_> NodeX: liar, you aren't kidding :P
[06:29:20] <jeffsmykil> ScottO_: http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2011/09/ultrabook-intels-300-million-plan-to-beat-apple-at-its-own-game.ars
[06:29:21] <NodeX> The MacBooks are nice .. If I had to have an Apple it would not be a desktop
[06:29:48] <whateverb> kborchers, and one easy question more, how can I set default first item opacity 1 and all other 0.3...... if clicked then clicked item has opacity 1 and all the other have 0.3
[06:30:02] <xec> inside the plugin 'this' doesn't seem to contain the collection for some reason
[06:30:03] <NodeX> but they are expensive and I dont really care about a little more weight, height, girth etc etc
[06:30:18] <kborchers> whateverb: if it was easy, couldn't you do it? ;) just a sec
[06:30:21] <sadmicrowave> heh, girth...
[06:30:22] <CantUnplug> NodeX - then its not the same..
[06:30:24] <NodeX> anyway I'm done with this debate .. each to their own
[06:30:28] <jeffsmykil> if im going to use something all day everyday i want it to be nice
[06:30:30] <Nomikos> YES
[06:30:49] <jeffsmykil> i could sleep on a cardboard box but i chose to have a mattress
[06:30:50] <NodeX> before the winblows / OSx debate starts lol
[06:31:11] <whateverb> kborchers, it seems its easy for you, but Im still learning basis...and example is the best way for me to understand what affects what :)
[06:31:17] <NodeX> jeffsmykil : that is futher away form the analagy than it could possibly be
[06:31:19] <troubleman> hey im working on this beat.. anybody into some far out visualization stuff and wanna create something to compliment it?
[06:31:31] <NodeX> you are inferring that anything that is not an Apple of bad
[06:31:40] <jeffsmykil> man my cod e is crashing browsers
[06:31:41] <pachet> troubleman: we're all nerds here. what is a beat?
[06:31:44] <jeffsmykil> this is bad
[06:31:49] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:31:53] <ablomen> jeffsmykil, buy a dell xps 15z then, aluminum, better screen then a macbook 15" (1920x1060 on a 15" screen) and a 1000 euro's cheaper then the same specked macbook ;)
[06:31:58] <NodeX> jeffsmykil : does it crash Apple and PC ? lol
[06:32:09] <jeffsmykil> what's a "Euro"
[06:32:10] <blackspotwiggins> haha
[06:32:12] <blackspotwiggins> well timed quit
[06:32:19] <jeffsmykil> is that that funny clown money?
[06:32:19] <NodeX> lmfao
[06:32:23] <NodeX> bash.org ^^
[06:32:38] <ablomen> jeffsmykil, that that money that still has some value
[06:32:43] <troubleman> pachet: muuuuuuuuuuuuuuusic man:P:P
[06:32:50] <jeffsmykil> ablomen: canadian?
[06:32:54] <NodeX> lmao .. here comes the USA / EUro debate
[06:32:57] <jeffsmykil> or the money the greeks use?
[06:32:59] <jeffsmykil> lol
[06:33:03] <ScottO_> jeffsmykil: whoo ultrabook
[06:33:10] <ablomen> lol yes the greeks use it too
[06:33:11] <sadmicrowave> we don't want that money
[06:33:18] <blackspotwiggins> quick, gnome/kde ; sc2 race wars
[06:33:23] <blackspotwiggins> any other hot subjects?
[06:33:30] <ablomen> religion?
[06:33:32] <jeffsmykil> i get excited now when i get a canadian quarter in my change
[06:33:32] <NodeX> we could always try religion
[06:33:34] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[06:33:39] <NodeX> might be lesss flamey :P
[06:33:41] <CantUnplug> wow.. the xps is ugly
[06:33:45] <jeffsmykil> im agnostic because i hate being wring
[06:33:45] <ScottO_> blackspotwiggins: dont ask dont tell?
[06:33:45] <CantUnplug> .. opinion of course
[06:33:49] <blackspotwiggins> #jquery is pretty much #nerdflamewars anyway
[06:34:02] <NodeX> omg goto #css (apparently)
[06:34:06] <blackspotwiggins> with occasional php questions and google-disabled folk wandering
[06:34:09] <jeffsmykil> CantUnplug:  you told me to use a text editor without code folding?!?!?!
[06:34:10] <CantUnplug> YUI is soo much better than jquery will ever be..  :)
[06:34:17] <NodeX> haahahahaha
[06:34:21] <blackspotwiggins> CantUnplug, keep going :)
[06:34:30] <jeffsmykil> mootools because it's like cows and i like cows
[06:34:31] <CantUnplug> just trying to change tiopic
[06:34:34] <xec> anyone feel like helping me debug my plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/hf9pf/2/ <-- why doesn't the .each() iterate through anything
[06:34:35] <sadmicrowave> blackspotwiggins, google-disabled folk <- lol
[06:34:37] <Nomikos> This is why we can't have nice things!
[06:34:54] <ablomen> lol
[06:35:02] <NodeX> err
[06:35:04] <CantUnplug> jeffsmykil - i only said.. hey checkout Kod its free and fast - good for big files
[06:35:13] <jeffsmykil> NO CODE FOLDING LOSE
[06:35:15] <NodeX> xec .. 'hide' is not a selector
[06:35:21] <xec> oh fuck me
[06:35:23] <NodeX> try .hide lkmfao
[06:35:28] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:35:32] <NodeX> palm to face
[06:35:46] <blackspotwiggins> face.apply(palm)
[06:35:47] <NodeX> I bet that's been bugging you for hours too ... I do it all the tiem
[06:35:56] <jeffsmykil> really jslint? with all the problems in my code you have a problem with spaces between my >?
[06:36:04] <NodeX> face.apply(palm,[eggs]);

[06:36:23] <xec> NodeX: thanks.. you're right, i have been staring at that way too long
[06:36:28] <NodeX> jeffsmykil : is it not easier to write valid code than debug it later ?
[06:36:33] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, i'd like to add a "<li>FOO</li>" to an <ul>, but the contents of FOO may be unsafe. I have a way to do it but it seems kind of inefficient. $('#mydiv ul').append("<li></li>");    $('#mydiv ul li:last').text('<script>alert("test")</script>');
[06:36:33] <CantUnplug> k, back to work.. need to go pay for my fancy, overpriced porn viewer
[06:36:37] <aple> Is it possible to grab all the inputs of a form with AJAX and ship them over together via JSON?
[06:36:40] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, try jshint
[06:36:46] <NodeX> xec - I always go for a walk when I can't solve stuff .. and it comes to me
[06:36:47] <aple> Serialization or something?
[06:36:59] <NodeX> aple : yes - excatly that
[06:37:19] <NodeX> except you need to split the serialised string
[06:37:21] <kborchers> whateverb: this should give you something to work with http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/PnRVe/16/
[06:37:41] <NodeX> CantUnplug : lmfao
[06:37:45] <MariusKarthaus> And the question is: what is a more efficient way to do that
[06:37:52] <sadmicrowave> MariusKarthaus, you have a way to do what? what are you needing help doing?
[06:37:55] <whateverb> nice, kborchers, thank You!
[06:37:58] <sadmicrowave> ok
[06:38:15] <MariusKarthaus> sadmicrowave: Hi, i'd like to add a "<li>FOO</li>" to an <ul>, but the contents of FOO may be unsafe.
[06:38:28] <sadmicrowave> no no, don't repeat
[06:38:29] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: hey, i don't remember. you going to the conference?
[06:38:30] <sadmicrowave> I can read up
[06:38:33] <NodeX> MariusKarthaus : sanitise ?
[06:38:40] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, nope
[06:38:52] <MariusKarthaus> of better yet i want this :  add a "<li>"+var+"</li>" to an <ul>, but the contents of FOO may be unsafe
[06:39:13] <sadmicrowave> MariusKarthaus, in what way may the contents be 'unsafe' ?
[06:39:13] <NodeX> unsae to who
[06:39:20] <kborchers> too bad ... gonna be a blast
[06:39:28] <NodeX> the user using it or injecting will be the only one affected lol
[06:39:34] <blackspotwiggins> MariusKarthaus, $("<li>", {text: unsafeshit}).appendTo("#list")
[06:39:54] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, yea, don't have the money, time, etc...tried to get my company to pay for it...but they laughed in my face and spit on my dreams (figuratively)
[06:40:06] <MariusKarthaus> var="<script>alert('foo');</script>"  ; $(ul).append("<li>"+var+"</li>");
[06:40:40] <NodeX> MariusKarthaus : the only person who can affect the unsafe is the user
[06:40:47] <NodeX> so he/she will be alerting themselves lol
[06:40:52] <MariusKarthaus> blackspotwiggins: that seems like what i needcx
[06:40:59] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yeah, i hear that. should be some pretty interesting discussions with the 1.7 beta just being released
[06:41:00] <sadmicrowave> can I get some clarification (from anyone at this point) as to what 'unsafe' means
[06:41:01] <NodeX> == internet arguing (pointless excersise)
[06:41:13] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, yea I looked at the agenda...looks pretty good
[06:41:21] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, ever heard of xss? xsrf?
[06:41:23] <NodeX> unless it's a remote XSS in which case your app should be sanatising
[06:41:25] <MariusKarthaus> NodeX, ehm that kind of depends on where var comes from
[06:41:50] <NodeX> blackspotwiggins : yes but I also sanitise everything lol - and I assumed everyone does
[06:42:05] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:42:09] <blackspotwiggins> that's exactly what MariusKarthaus is doing
[06:42:38] <sadmicrowave> ?unsafe
[06:42:39] <bot-t> http://www.flickr.com/photos/rj3/5640480733/in/set-72157626384536705
[06:42:50] <MariusKarthaus> NodeX: I hope that by "I sanitize everything" you do not only mean server-side right?
[06:42:53] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:42:57] <NodeX> in javascript lol, ok...
[06:43:02] <NodeX> each to their own
[06:43:22] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, if you are consuming data in clientside, why not?
[06:43:34] <NodeX> MariusKarthaus : why would I need to sanatise client side if I contreol the input ...
[06:43:40] <jeffsmykil> jshint seems to hate my code
[06:43:42] <sadmicrowave> Thank you!
[06:43:52] <sadmicrowave> NodeX^
[06:44:10] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, still doing XML importing?
[06:44:11] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, yea jslint hurts your feelings, jshint uses a bit more sane requirements
[06:44:24] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: thank god done with that
[06:44:33] <sadmicrowave> lol, thats all I heard from you for weeks
[06:44:45] <sadmicrowave> (or more)
[06:44:50] <jeffsmykil> it was like a week tyvm
[06:44:58] <jeffsmykil> do traversing xml is THE WORST
[06:45:50] <NickASloan> is there a way to use .live to bind a plugin function to an element?
[06:46:04] <MariusKarthaus> blackspotwiggins: thank you it works like a charm at less computations
[06:46:05] <NickASloan> or something similar
[06:46:19] <NodeX> NickASloan : how do you mean
[06:47:28] <NickASloan> NodeX: I have a plugin .validateForm() which sets up a  bunch of handlers on the form element, but the forms are being created by an ajax call themselves
[06:47:49] <aple> NodeX: Do I serialize or serializeArray?
[06:47:51] <NickASloan> probably better to just call .validateForm() on the forms in the ajax callback
[06:48:07] <NodeX> open the plugin and change submit( to live('submit'
[06:48:23] <jhine> NodeX, finally wrote it up :P http://jsfiddle.net/ta9gZ/ - Using jQuery, how can I move the td.c_info-r next to td.c_last without this happening http://meh.ltdev.im/~lustra/test.html
[06:48:23] <aple> NodeX: serializeArray for passing JSON around right?
[06:48:38] <NodeX> aple : check the docs
[06:48:40] <sadmicrowave> f.y.i - awesome plugin = HighCharts
[06:49:41] <ScottO_> omg
[06:49:44] <ScottO_> formObject.validate.showErrors({"short": "At least one of these fields needs to be filled out."});
[06:49:48] <ScottO_> is there anythnig wrong with that?
[06:49:53] <NickASloan> NodeX: yeah. that hit me as I was going to move the function call
[06:50:03] <NodeX> hehe
[06:50:06] <ScottO_> i keep getting 'has no method showErrors'
[06:50:31] <NodeX> I am suprised that in the world of ajax loading pages more plugin dev's dont use live instead of the normal bindings
[06:50:47] <ScottO_> NodeX: i use live most of the time
[06:50:52] <NodeX> m,e too
[06:50:56] <NodeX> just incase!
[06:51:13] <NodeX> jhine : I'm just making it for you
[06:51:26] <jhine> NodeX: thank you :)
[06:51:27] <ScottO_> anyone familiar with validation plugin?
[06:51:32] <ScottO_> this is irritating
[06:52:21] <MariusKarthaus> NodeX: to answer your qeustion: I always escape things that I know will never be html. Even if I'm sure that I will always control the input and that the input will never be html. If I have a serverside int, that I want to output, I first htmlspecialchars() it serverside, send it to the browser in json, and when I add the json data to the code I add that using .text(). I know very redundant when you *know* the data is never going
[06:52:21] <MariusKarthaus> to be anything else than an int. But again every XSS bug out there is made because some programmer thought he had it under control
[06:52:54] <NickASloan> NodeX: well on top of that, the guy who wrote this plugin was using an unnecessary .each over the selected elements, and binding them inside of that.
[06:52:57] <NickASloan> no reason for that.
[06:53:54] <NodeX> MariusKarthaus : I wans't attacking your code dude ..
[06:53:54] <NickASloan> :w
[06:55:26] <g0bl1n> I have a GET $.ajax call that receives a PDF file. What should I insert in the success callback so that the browser opens it ? The response headers are  Connection:close
[06:55:26] <g0bl1n> Content-Transfer-Encoding:binary
[06:55:26] <g0bl1n> Content-Type:application/pdf
[06:56:00] <g0bl1n> the browser doesn't open it via jquery. Is I insert the URL in the browser, it opens the pdf
[06:56:27] <blackspotwiggins> g0bl1n, just dont use ajax
[06:57:05] <g0bl1n> blackspotwiggins, but the server may return an error, and via Ajax I can handle it
[06:57:14] <g0bl1n> success / error
[06:57:34] <MariusKarthaus> Sorry I always get on edge when I hear a programmer say " i don't need to escape, because I control the input". I've seen too many programmers be correct about that in 99.99% of the time, and than being suprised that the one time they were wrong let to the defacement of their clients site
[06:57:44] <blackspotwiggins> g0bl1n, you cant, in that case
[06:57:50] <m4xx> anyone have an idea why this float doesnt display properly next to the tabs? http://jsfiddle.net/Ksnm8/
[06:57:52] <blackspotwiggins> btw it also depends on the plugin configuration
[06:57:59] <blackspotwiggins> it might not display inside the browser
[06:58:26] <g0bl1n> blackspotwiggins, can't ??!
[06:58:58] <jugstah> how can I find all nested divs within a div so I can hide them all and only just one?
[06:59:13] <g0bl1n> can't an Ajax call receive an attachment ??
[06:59:24] <m4xx> jugstah:  try $('div',$target_div).hide();
[06:59:26] <NodeX> jhine : My brain is not working - I cannot work out how to do such a simple query :S
[06:59:30] <sadmicrowave> jugstah, .children
[07:00:17] <jugstah> cool thx ill go look it up
[07:01:17] <g0bl1n> the browser receives it, Chrome tells me
[07:02:21] <NodeX> did anyone in here write the lightBox() plugin by any chance
[07:02:34] <sadmicrowave> ?children @ jugstah
[07:02:34] <bot-t> jugstah, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[07:03:19] <ScottO_> weird, im being told that my element type is undefined
[07:03:24] <m4xx> float's next to tabs? anyone?
[07:03:32] <ScottO_> in firefox and chrome
[07:03:47] <starsinmypockets> Good morning all - I'm trying to find a solution for a scheduling block UI - mockup: http://tinypic.com/r/2udu9n4/7 anyone done similar? point me at some good resources? tnx :)
[07:04:32] <blackspotwiggins> g0bl1n, you can't display it without navigating to it
[07:04:33] <ScottO_> iots a textarea, yet jquery validation plugin is telling me that the type is undefined
[07:04:36] <blackspotwiggins> thus making ajax pointless
[07:04:42] <ScottO_> do i have to set a type on the textarea also?
[07:04:52] <blackspotwiggins> better make sure that you dont display links to errored pdfs
[07:05:22] <NodeX> ScottO_ : textareas don't havea  type!
[07:05:33] <dckur> https://gist.github.com/1250785 where id the data saved? I see nothing in firebug
[07:05:34] <ScottO_> NodeX: so its a bug in the validation plugin?
[07:05:38] <ScottO_> great....
[07:05:49] <dckur> *where is
[07:05:57] <m4xx> anyone? ;[ http://jsfiddle.net/Ksnm8/
[07:06:05] <krad> anyone familiar with date.js?  i just can't get it to parse 2011-09-29T00:00:00Z
[07:06:21] <NodeX> ScottO_ : pastebin the line it moans about
[07:06:39] <FNTom> Anybody know a good site with a lot of nice jQuery UI widgets for handling data? Multi select boxes, tree views etc
[07:06:55] <dckur> I have a question about .data , I curious where it is saved, for example this https://gist.github.com/1250785 is it saved as div attribute?
[07:07:01] <m4xx> i can put a margin on it to achieve the effect i'm looking for.
[07:07:03] <dckur> cause i see nothing in firebug
[07:07:04] <ScottO_> NodeX: if (element.type === 'radio') {
[07:07:09] <ScottO_> no need for pastebin
[07:07:29] <NodeX> yuck ... perhaps a swicth would be better
[07:07:34] <NodeX> switch *
[07:07:37] <ScottO_> :/
[07:07:46] <hrwath> m4xx, http://jsfiddle.net/Ksnm8/1/
[07:07:47] <ScottO_> any of the validation plugin devs in here?
[07:07:52] <hrwath> m4xx, add margin
[07:08:03] <NodeX> ScottO_ : are you sanitising app side aswell ?
[07:08:06] <jugstah> .children().hide(); is good stuff
[07:08:07] <ScottO_> id rather not hack the validation plugin :/
[07:08:07] <jugstah> thx
[07:08:24] <Xotix> can i combine drag/dropable with sortable somehow?
[07:08:28] <m4xx> hrwath: that's closer, but i want the top of the float to be even with the top of the tab widget
[07:08:32] <ScottO_> NodeX: whats that got to do with js?
[07:09:02] <NodeX> because if you just need to check empty then you can use mine which is about 10 lines
[07:09:08] <NodeX> and do the rest app side
[07:09:14] <ScottO_> no not just check empty
[07:09:22] <ScottO_> im trying to trigger a showErrors
[07:09:32] <ScottO_> to show custmo erros for 2 fields if both of them are empty
[07:09:34] <hrwath> m4xx, so change the amount of margin pixels ;-)
[07:09:44] <m4xx> that's what i'm trying not to do
[07:09:47] <NodeX> I've never used it so I can't help
[07:09:53] <ScottO_> :(
[07:10:09] <NodeX> pasting the line and the error perhaps .. element.type=='radio doesnt really help'
[07:10:12] <NodeX> oops
[07:10:24] <ScottO_> NodeX: ?
[07:10:26] <m4xx> hrwath: i dont see anything in the tab widget that's actually setting the width
[07:10:39] <m4xx> when i look at it with firebug
[07:10:51] <NodeX> you posted if(element.type=='radio') .. that really doesn't help to help you
[07:11:00] <ScottO_> thats in the plugin
[07:11:21] <ScottO_> im just using http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/showErrors#errors
[07:11:29] <ScottO_> on 2 textareas
[07:11:45] <hrwath> m4xx, I don't know then - gotta go
[07:12:04] <NodeX> and do they have a name and id attribute
[07:12:09] <ScottO_> yes
[07:12:28] <NodeX> what exactl;y is the error message
[07:12:38] <ScottO_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined
[07:12:41] <ScottO_> thats in chrome
[07:13:10] <ScottO_> in firefox its element is undefined
[07:13:10] <ScottO_> http://dealers.umasolar.local/js/jquery.validate.js
[07:13:12] <NodeX> hmmz... can you pastebin the lines surrounding the code it refers to so I dont have to download it
[07:13:12] <ScottO_> Line 242err
[07:13:25] <ScottO_> i hate firebug
[07:13:29] <NodeX> I can't access that URL lol
[07:13:36] <ScottO_> i know
[07:13:42] <ScottO_> it cant just copy a url
[07:13:48] <ScottO_> err i mean an error
[07:13:57] <ScottO_> "element is undefined"
[07:13:59] <ScottO_> in firefox
[07:14:57] <gnarf> ScottO_: the answer to that one isn't in the docs
[07:14:59] <gnarf> just want you to know
[07:15:00] * gnarf grins
[07:15:07] <ScottO_> gnarf: LOL thanks
[07:15:12] <NodeX> lmfao
[07:15:13] <ScottO_> gnarf: so i can bitch now?
[07:15:21] <ScottO_> :P
[07:15:27] <NodeX> bitch about a free tool ... not a great idea :P
[07:15:33] <ScottO_> is it free?
[07:15:43] <ScottO_> do you count time wasted on bugs?
[07:15:58] <ScottO_> nothing is ever free
[07:15:59] <NodeX> you got it for free and accepted the liscnece when using it
[07:16:08] <NodeX> which stated "software is "As is"
[07:16:16] <ScottO_> EVERYTHING comes at a price
[07:16:23] <NodeX> no doubt ...
[07:16:33] <ScottO_> but yeah i accepted as is
[07:16:37] <ScottO_> i guess ill modify it
[07:16:43] <NodeX> best way
[07:16:58] <NodeX> I have a similar thing with a plugin .. I'll just edit it
[07:17:03] <gnarf> damn topic length lmits....
[07:17:15] <pachet> m4xx: http://jsfiddle.net/q3e3U/
[07:17:44] <ScottO_> gnarf: so what changed?
[07:18:08] <NodeX> It's normaly why I write my own rather than use someone else's
[07:18:16] <m4xx> pachet: thank you, someone has already suggested this solution.
[07:18:26] <m4xx> i want it to be outside of the tab widget
[07:18:35] <m4xx> i'de also like to do it with out having to sent a margin
[07:18:40] <m4xx> *margin-right
[07:18:44] <pachet> oh, woops, must've missed it
[07:19:11] <ScottO_> whats the best way to check if type exists first?
[07:19:32] <ScottO_> im not familiar with the js way
[07:19:40] <NodeX> typeof
[07:19:42] <ScottO_> normally id make sure its set
[07:19:47] <NodeX> oh sorry ..
[07:20:00] <m4xx> element.type != undefined
[07:20:07] <NodeX> if(typeof(element.type)!='undefined') { ...
[07:20:09] <ScottO_> ah undefined check
[07:20:12] <ScottO_> coolt hansk
[07:20:17] <NodeX> wrap it up around your code
[07:20:41] <ScottO_> oh i was gonna modify the validation plugin itself
[07:21:20] <m4xx> anyone else want to take a stab at it? ;p
[07:22:12] <gnarf> damnit!
[07:22:24] <ScottO_> wait, is it sayign that the type is missing? or that my element doesnt exist?
[07:22:25] <m4xx> lawl
[07:22:29] <gnarf> I guess i'm removing the heart
[07:22:43] <gnarf> needed its 2 chars
[07:22:44] <NodeX> element doesnt exist
[07:22:48] <ScottO_> thats what i thought
[07:22:52] <ScottO_> proba anaming issue
[07:22:59] <NodeX> if(element.size()>=1) { ...
[07:23:18] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, â™¥
[07:23:28] <ScottO_> ah
[07:23:32] <m4xx> plz? margin-left is so hacky
[07:23:35] <m4xx> ;[
[07:23:41] <m4xx> *margin-right
[07:23:48] <ScottO_> had to use the 'data[name]' as the name of the field
[07:24:22] <m4xx> yay!
[07:26:40] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, there is a possiblity of further optimizing by moving the dev channels to their versions/links.. but meh
[07:27:00] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: i stopped caring as soon as I got it fitting
[07:27:02] <gnarf> :)
[07:27:14] <blackspotwiggins> hehe
[07:27:16] <juha_> hmm
[07:27:24] <blackspotwiggins> maximize lazyness :)
[07:27:44] <juha_> four different event apis on 1.7b.. jquery starting to resemble php
[07:28:07] <juha_> couple years from now, we'll have 10 differently spelled functions to do the same things
[07:28:19] <blackspotwiggins> juha_, with different naming styles
[07:28:30] <blackspotwiggins> CamelCase to snake_case to WTF_Is_This
[07:28:38] <juha_> indeed
[07:28:39] <discorpia> juha_: idd. the extremely restrictive apple model makes more and more sense
[07:28:43] <gnarf> juha_: actually, there is only one
[07:28:50] <gnarf> juha_: just 6 shortcuts

[07:30:47] <albertosh> what's the reason why an image is not triggering the click event???
[07:31:00] <juha_> wrong selector.
[07:31:15] <albertosh> no, the selector is the right one :S
[07:34:10] <jugstah> rere pachet :-)
[07:34:41] <jhine> How can I do "selector append to the closest td.c_last"
[07:34:42] <juha_> it's crazy how fast jquery has evolved in the last 18 months
[07:35:12] <jugstah> jquery in asp.net is fun if not a roya PITA :-)
[07:35:17] <jugstah> royal even
[07:37:40] <Baribal> Hi. I'm a bit confused by a piece of code that I'm working on, one that works with .dialog. So... Form items are created in HTML and buttons in jQuery code, is that corrent? And usual? And if so, how do I style the buttons? Right now, my dialog looks like crap.
[07:38:50] <pachet> m4xx: sorry for the delay... blame jsfiddle
[07:38:56] <pachet> maybe http://jsfiddle.net/cgz4w/ is closer to what you want
[07:40:42] <m4xx> pachet: that's close also, but i want the tabs to be resizeable
[07:43:10] <sphinxxx> does having console.log in your code on production do something bad for SEO or something? or does it trigger errors on some browsers?
[07:43:33] <NodeX> browsers that' dont have console.log will not exec the JS
[07:43:43] <NodeX> because it's calling a function that's not there!
[07:44:00] <NodeX> wrap your console.log .. if (window.console) {console.log(....
[07:44:25] <j0ls0n> @sphinxx it will cause errors
[07:44:29] <sphinxxx> whats the point? if it can't run  it, it just won't run no?
[07:44:39] <NodeX> no
[07:44:40] <sphinxxx> oh it will put out errors
[07:44:44] <NodeX> :D
[07:44:53] <sphinxxx> well anyway, i have a console.log line on one of my sites by accident
[07:45:01] <sphinxxx> just wondering the repurcussions
[07:45:24] <NodeX> IE will die
[07:45:56] <Baribal> IE *should* die. IE *has to* die.
[07:46:12] <pachet> m4xx: resizable in what way ;o
[07:46:16] <NodeX> DOn't let bill gates hear you say that
[07:46:19] <pachet> based on the amount of text visible in ui-tabs-panel?
[07:46:25] <NodeX> he might try and revive it :P
[07:48:09] <Baribal> I'm working for a social media analytics company, and one rather big client of ours has a rather display bug on our site because they're still using IE... 7, I think. Maybe even 6.
[07:48:26] <bottom_feeder> dang!
[07:49:33] <Baribal> I'm amazed how much their IT department must suck.
[07:50:59] <PhanLord> anyone with jquery.mobile experience ? im trying to put a select as a button on header (but it alwasy goes into 2nd line and not on the edge , any way around it)
[07:51:07] <dckur> !g api
[07:51:16] <dckur> sry...
[07:51:29] <jugstah> I hate people who define static height on modular layouts
[07:51:31] <jugstah> drive me crazy
[07:52:19] <FNTom> Is there a recommended approach to polling data via AJAX for multiple datasets?
[07:52:43] <FNTom> E.g. I want one poll every x seconds and the server could return several events that have happened in one response
[07:52:57] <RuAfo> Hello
[07:53:04] <FNTom> Such as "New message recieved, new project listed" etc
[07:53:39] <RuAfo> Is there anyone that would be willing to help me with a jquery question? I've been racking my brain for 2 days now and I can't get it wrapped around this
[07:53:58] <pachet> if you absolutely have to do polling, then poll for a compiled event list object
[07:54:00] <FNTom> RuAfo: Best thing is to ask and see if somebody knows
[07:54:10] <pachet> events in that object trigger a followup call to whatever service you need
[07:54:13] <RuAfo> ok
[07:54:25] <FNTom> pachet: Why the negative connotation on polling?
[07:55:23] <fuchstronaut> whats the maximal width i should use for web layouts?
[07:56:30] <booboonathan> Does anyone know of the plugin that does the same effect as the www.me.com
[07:56:35] <booboonathan> the floating particles
[07:56:42] <booboonathan> it looks incredible
[07:56:59] <jugstah> fuch- what kind of layout?
[07:57:00] <RuAfo> I am working on a page that has a select option box. You select someone's name and it shows a div layer and fades out the background (like lightbox). In that div it will populate with the user's data from the database.
[07:57:01] <RuAfo> I can get my head around how to get the select box to open the div (using the OnClick() or Change() but I can't get my head around how for it to pass the information to the layer so that it can pull the information it needs to to populate the div.
[07:57:03] <eddiemonge> fuchstronaut: 100%
[07:57:04] <jugstah> a typical website or?
[07:57:22] <fuchstronaut> (eddiemonge): touche!
[07:57:37] <jugstah> to cater to the typical user and also the dumbass still using a CRT tube monitor... 960px wide is good
[07:57:45] <fuchstronaut> thanks
[07:57:52] <fuchstronaut> guess ill stay with 960px then
[07:57:53] <jugstah> that way there's no horizontal scroll
[07:58:01] <eddiemonge> fuchstronaut: im serious, use 100%. dont stretch your text conent that wide but make your site responsive
[07:59:02] <FNTom> eddiemonge: I think he means the actual design aspect of it :o
[07:59:32] <RuAfo> Any ideas?
[08:00:14] <eddiemonge> FNTom: me too
[08:00:47] <booboonathan> anyone?
[08:00:58] <eddiemonge> RuAfo: is the information already on the page or are you fetching it with ajax?
[08:01:11] <RuAfo> was thinking of fetching it with ajax
[08:01:16] <Xeon06_> Does anyone know off the top of their head why a submitted form would behave differently if submitted using enter instead of clicking on a button?
[08:01:35] <RuAfo> Xeon06: What browser? all of them?
[08:02:12] <jugstah> i think you need to use bind and click to cover all browsers, no?
[08:02:13] <eddiemonge> Xeon06_: different how? sometimes the submit value wont get sent when using enter from an input field
[08:02:21] <RuAfo> eddiemonage: was thinking of fetching it with ajax
[08:02:28] <Xeon06_> RuAfo: Yeah, pretty much
[08:02:50] <ccmonster> back. yaya
[08:02:55] <eddiemonge> RuAfo: have the ajax success callback load the new div with the information whether by returning a dom fragment and appending that to the div or by returning json and contructing the content and then adding it
[08:03:26] <RuAfo> Xeon06: Maybe your submit is using "keyup" instead of "click"?
[08:04:15] <RuAfo> eddiemonge: Appending it to the DIV, that's a good idea. Not sure why I didn't think about that.
[08:04:17] <RuAfo> I'll try that
[08:04:18] <Xeon06_> eddiemonge: My validation isn't working for a particular field. For some reason a promise isn't working, but it's working fine on click
[08:04:19] <RuAfo> thanks
[08:04:22] <Xeon06_> RuAfo: It's on submit
[08:05:09] <RuAfo> eddiemonage: Thank you
[08:05:27] <eddiemonge> Xeon06_: how is it bound? code?
[08:06:47] <Xeon06_> eddiemonge: It's allright, I'll try debugging more. It would take too much time to try and reproduce it minimally and probably might not work. I got something in there. I just wanted to know whether it was a known issue. Thanks
[08:08:01] <pachet> booboonathan: google for jquery particles ;(
[08:08:13] <booboonathan> packet, i tried that
[08:08:17] <eddiemonge> make sure you bind the validation to the $(form).submit() and not to $(submitbutton).click()
[08:08:25] <booboonathan> but they're all over ally complicated
[08:08:28] <booboonathan> and nothing replicates it
[08:10:02] <jugstah> i love how this kid spends a hour trying to figure out something and asks me for help so i go to his desk and i see a misspelling and it works
[08:10:03] <jugstah> classic
[08:10:17] <jugstah> happens to the best of us.
[08:10:36] <pachet> anything that tries to replicate something written for canvas is going to involve a lot of overhead ;(
[08:11:11] <booboonathan> :(
[08:14:41] <jugstah> is it remotely possible that jquery can reorder unordered listings? :-)
[08:15:01] <NodeX> how do you mean ..
[08:15:12] <NodeX> do they have some kind of index or identifier ?
[08:15:55] <jugstah> not really.. its just <ul><li></li> thats it... but if i can reorder based on finding the first letter in H4 of the <ul><li><h4>whatevergoeshere</h4>
[08:15:56] <Xeon06_> eddiemonge: It is bound that way
[08:16:06] <pachet> FNTom: i've built up a healthy skepticism for people using polling as a solution to push dynamically
[08:16:15] <pachet> but thats mostly just from experience with devs implementing it poorly
[08:16:29] <pachet> i can take it on faith that you know what you're doing! ;o
[08:19:39] <FNTom> Hah pachet, I like comet / server pushing or event subscribing methods
[08:20:04] <FNTom> But not really the right solution for this I don't think
[08:20:42] <NodeX> nginx push module + jquery ftw
[08:20:51] <NodeX> no noticable load
[08:22:41] <ccmonster> mk, im actually here now, if it matters to anyone
[08:24:53] <NodeX> did you cough for the doc ?
[08:25:56] <test> Hi i am a newbie can you let me knw is it necessary to know javascript to learn jquery
[08:26:09] <pachet> debatable ;o
[08:27:05] <jugstah> not really
[08:27:16] <jugstah> but useful to know the difference
[08:27:34] <jugstah> but dont listen to me, im a relative newbie compared to the others in here :-)
[08:27:35] <test> is the jquery site only the way to learn jquery
[08:27:56] <test> thanks
[08:28:01] <m4xx> pachet: sorry, was on the phone. width should resize with the page
[08:28:11] <jugstah> no.. there are books, sites and all that
[08:29:12] <m4xx> anyone else? floats next to tabs with out margin-top or margin-right hacks? http://jsfiddle.net/Ksnm8/
[08:29:42] <FNTom> NodeX: I'm considering push (allows more flexability in the future) but it would have to be something along the model of
[08:30:01] <FNTom> PHP Script is run, if something notable happens send the results to Redis for queuing
[08:30:14] <FNTom> Then NodeJS pulls from Redis and pushes via HTTP
[08:31:03] <m4xx> got it!
[08:31:15] <m4xx> apply overflow hidden to the #tabs div
[08:33:16] <m4xx> as seen here http://jsfiddle.net/Ksnm8/2/
[08:35:09] <pachet> what happens if a tab element has an exceeding width ;o
[08:35:34] <m4xx> quite frankly i don't give a damn
[08:35:35] <m4xx> ;x
[08:36:07] <bung> if I have <a href="javascript:someFunc()">link</a> and I have var foo = $('a').attr('href'); how can I run the function having $foo ?
[08:36:26] <bung> assuming i substr out 'javascript:'
[08:36:36] <eddiemonge> bung ew dont do that
[08:36:50] <bung> eddiemonge: client has those links, cant change it
[08:36:56] <bung> :'(
[08:37:29] <eddiemonge> why not? that is really dirty
[08:37:51] <dabear> bung: get the name of the function, here "someFunc" and then run window["someFunc"]()
[08:38:04] <bung> fascinating
[08:38:25] <eddiemonge> yay for xss!
[08:38:42] <dabear> sure
[08:38:53] <pachet> m4xx: http://jsfiddle.net/A2VeL/
[08:39:00] <pachet> hack and half, if you ask me
[08:39:00] <dabear> he has to validate that someFunc is safe to run
[08:40:27] <eddiemonge> $5 says he wouldnt have
[08:41:08] <aaronmcadam> roll on 1.7
[08:41:14] <aaronmcadam> it fuckin rulezzzz
[08:41:40] <bung> this is only getting run on (href.substr(0,19)=='javascript:someFunc') where someFunc is already existing and working
[08:41:49] <aaronmcadam> what in the fuck
[08:42:05] <aaronmcadam> do it right ffs
[08:42:15] <bung> is there some other validation?
[08:42:34] <aaronmcadam> don't call your js funcs like that
[08:42:51] <bung> cant be helped, like i said
[08:42:53] <snover> what in the fuck indeed
[08:42:53] <bot-t> (10 hours 30 mins ago) <coldhead> tell snover YOU FEEL ME, BRO?
[08:42:55] <eddiemonge> bung: why are you even trying to do that when the function will run when clicked anyway?
[08:43:01] <aaronmcadam> ?lunch?

Originally inspired by the JSON-REST plugin by Nathan Bubna, this takes it a step furth... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/rails-rest
[08:43:30] <aaronmcadam> what exactly are you trying to do bung
[08:44:08] <bung> eddiemonge: a lot of other stuff has to happen
[08:44:12] <bung> new layer on top of existing site
[08:44:39] <snover> you know there is this amazing concept called aspect-oriented programming
[08:44:59] <snover> you can replace old functions with new functions
[08:45:05] <eddiemonge> why are you making things hard on yourself? teach the client the right way of doing it and they will be grateful. hesitant and stubborn but eventually grateful
[08:47:12] <bung> eddiemonge: no time :(
[08:47:21] <enjoycrf> hahaha
[08:47:41] <enjoycrf> wats up yallz
[08:48:16] <pachet> jquery's maturity and coherence indeces
[08:48:20] <pachet> oh wait, now they're dropping
[08:48:22] <jugstah> client calls and complains that we're not doing their site 'fast enough' so my boss goes "ok, want us to make it live?"
[08:48:28] <jugstah> they reply "yes please"
[08:48:35] <jugstah> then two hours later, they call back bitching
[08:48:47] <jugstah> "site's broken"... well, we told you it isnt ready to go live!!
[08:48:48] <jugstah> idjits
[08:49:01] <enjoycrf> thats cause ur slow
[08:49:08] <jugstah> now this guy's boss is mad at him cuz now its billable
[08:49:09] <jugstah> hahaha
[08:49:10] <enjoycrf> give it to me
[08:49:11] <xec> yeah, you need to be fast
[08:49:54] <jugstah> 'fast' doesnt mean "done right"
[08:50:03] <enjoycrf> actually
[08:50:09] <enjoycrf> that depends
[08:50:13] <xec> you need to do it right, and fast
[08:50:13] <jedimind_> fast, cheap, quality, pick two
[08:50:15] <xec> :D
[08:50:21] <jugstah> granted, none of you know the background on this :-)
[08:50:32] <enjoycrf> yes
[08:50:38] <enjoycrf> but
[08:50:52] <enjoycrf> every since site i work on is horrible
[08:50:53] <pachet> slow, slow, lunch, pick two
[08:50:56] <enjoycrf> single
[08:51:00] <jugstah> no buts.. there's 100+ of content pages coded by some amateur idiot
[08:51:07] <xec> i pick "slow" and "lunch"
[08:51:20] <enjoycrf> the only code ive seen that was good is professional packages
[08:51:28] <xec> do i win something?
[08:51:35] <enjoycrf> so that makes it kinda scary
[08:51:41] <jugstah> enjoycrt- you'd be charging them more if you saw their 'tables' :-)
[08:52:05] <enjoycrf> ppl talk a lot
[08:52:17] <enjoycrf> oop this
[08:52:24] <enjoycrf> module that
[08:52:37] <enjoycrf> but everything is still procedural
[08:52:40] <enjoycrf> lol
[08:52:58] <pachet> sounds like you work somewhere shitty
[08:53:01] <jugstah> its dumb when this kid is an intern webmaster at a large medical company
[08:53:09] <enjoycrf> or ive seen ppl atempt to use classes but dont use them properly
[08:53:32] <jugstah> work beckons, brb in a jif.
[08:53:37] <enjoycrf> well ive been doing this for over 10 yrs
[08:53:56] <enjoycrf> so ive seen all types of sites in all kinds of languages
[08:54:05] <ccmonster> procedural is wackness :)
[08:54:15] <enjoycrf> my code is like this
[08:54:24] <enjoycrf> $form->fields
[08:54:29] <enjoycrf> $form->display()
[08:54:43] <enjoycrf> $grid->display
[08:55:03] <enjoycrf> like a full on page is like 10 lines max
[08:55:07] <g0bl1n> ... so no downloads with Ajax calls...
[08:55:42] <ccmonster> who?
[08:56:15] <m4xx> pachet: getting rid of some of the useless styles will fix the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/A2VeL/1/
[08:56:21] <enjoycrf> or i do shit like
[08:56:30] <enjoycrf> $db->edit($_POST)
[08:56:39] <enjoycrf> super sick

[09:05:57] <aaronmcadam> haven't used svg in 3 years tho hah
[09:07:06] <s34n> aaronmcadam: in svg, transform does things like rotate, scale, or move position of an item
[09:07:17] <aaronmcadam> yes
[09:07:30] <aaronmcadam> i dunno what he was trying to do
[09:07:30] <enjoycrf> u know file upload ->browse
[09:07:38] <enjoycrf> <input type=file

[09:16:39] <aaronmcadam> that'll guide u thru it ck
[09:16:45] <ck> thanks
[09:16:48] <aaronmcadam> np
[09:16:51] <ck> first time seeing this site
[09:16:58] <aaronmcadam> ah right it's not too bad
[09:17:07] <aaronmcadam> just gotta make sure u select the right libs to use
[09:17:45] <ccmonster> bah. i need a new charger for my damn galaxy tab.
[09:17:47] <ccmonster> boo
[09:18:58] <Anticom> i'm feeling so dumb
[09:18:59] <Anticom> if(keyPath.substring(0,4) != "/_2/" AND keyPath.length == 3) {
[09:19:02] <Anticom> what's wrong about that one?
[09:19:15] <Anticom> firebug console is telling me "missing ) after condition"
[09:19:16] <aaronmcadam> AND?
[09:19:23] <aaronmcadam> use &&
[09:19:23] <ccmonster> that means it's missing
[09:19:28] <Anticom> ah okay
[09:19:29] <ccmonster> &&
[09:19:30] <ccmonster> yea
[09:19:30] <ccmonster> damn
[09:19:33] <ccmonster> beat me to it :)
[09:19:34] <jbrokc> how can I get .append('<some html code'>') to fade in?     .append('<some html code>').fadeIn(200) doesn't quite work
[09:19:36] <aaronmcadam> haha
[09:19:42] <Anticom> i hate those kind of bugs :D
[09:19:47] <aaronmcadam> bugs?
[09:19:50] <ck> aaron i'll get this setup and come back when i have a link
[09:19:52] <jak> jbrokc, .hide().fadeIn() ?
[09:19:53] <ccmonster> that's certainly not a bug.
[09:19:55] <aaronmcadam> that's just invalid syntax bro :P
[09:20:11] <ccmonster> bro-heim
[09:20:20] <ccmonster> it is roshashana today (sp?)
[09:20:24] <ccmonster> :)
[09:20:26] <Anticom> nice, works (:
[09:20:26] <aaronmcadam> wtf is that?
[09:20:31] <s34n> anybody from DAER hanging out here?
[09:20:42] <ccmonster> rosh hashanah lol
[09:20:47] <Anticom> fuu... gotta go
[09:20:48] <ccmonster> jewish holiday
[09:20:49] <Anticom> bye guys
[09:20:53] <Anticom> thanks for support (:
[09:20:56] <aaronmcadam> ur either mixing up SQL or PHP there i think
[09:21:06] <aaronmcadam> we'll never know :D
[09:21:36] <ccmonster> :)
[09:21:38] <jbrokc> jak: not quite
[09:21:58] <aaronmcadam> do u still have to do hide().fadeIn(0
[09:22:08] <aaronmcadam> would have thought that would be fixed by now
[09:22:59] <jak> ?append
[09:23:00] <bot-t> .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[09:25:08] <helpcrypto> hi all
[09:25:37] <helpcrypto> today im really having a headhache, and after hours googling and trying, i decided to come
[09:25:45] <jak> eek
[09:25:46] <antihero> is $.get somehow different form $.getJSON when it comes to access control?
[09:25:49] <jak> didnt want to know that
[09:26:00] <antihero> I want to get the contents of a page on my server but under a different domain
[09:26:03] <aaronmcadam> antihero: getJSON just sets the data type to json for u
[09:26:08] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[09:26:10] <aaronmcadam> ?sop @ antihero
[09:26:10] <bot-t> antihero, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[09:26:13] <helpcrypto> i want to send some POST info though ajax to another domain (cross-domain post then)
[09:26:16] <aaronmcadam> ?sop workarounds @ antihero
[09:26:17] <bot-t> antihero, workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[09:26:29] <aaronmcadam> use YQL it's handy
[09:26:39] <helpcrypto> i have tried jsonp, but as the server doesnt like jsonp, my call never "returns"
[09:26:48] <antihero> XMLHttpRequest cannot load XXX. Origin XXX is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:27:03] <erichynds> JSONP isn't actually ajax
[09:27:08] <erichynds> it just loads a script tag
[09:27:13] <aaronmcadam> yesyes
[09:27:22] <aaronmcadam> antihero: read those links
[09:27:39] <antihero> aaronmcadam: So I *can* fetch stuff if it's actually JSON?
[09:27:45] <helpcrypto> so...more or less...i trying to do a cross-domain post ajax call, but seems i cannot use jsonp (cause the server just answers html, not jsonp) and my success function is never raised
[09:27:51] <aaronmcadam> it's not the fact of the data type
[09:27:54] <zaf-Coral> Am using flot to generate bar graph, but the bars are always about 1-5px thick ... I have tried setting the barWidth, any ideas ?
[09:27:55] <aaronmcadam> it's the workarounds
[09:27:56] <antihero> so if I simply encapsulate my HTML in json?
[09:28:02] <antihero> ok
[09:28:06] <aaronmcadam> might be best to use a proxy, depending on ur situation
[09:28:31] <aaronmcadam> zaf-Coral: you sure it's not a css specificity issue
[09:28:44] <helpcrypto> dont know if antihero and i need "the same"
[09:29:02] <helpcrypto> im trying to do a cross-domain post ajax call, but seems i cannot use jsonp (cause the server just answers html, not jsonp) and my success function is never raised
[09:29:06] <zaf-Coral> aaronmcadam: Hmm, I don't think it is, if I have 1 bar, the bar spans the entire graph
[09:29:27] <aaronmcadam> cool
[09:29:35] <mbroadst> is there a plugin that provides a drop down menu for a button, as in a <button> element, not a custom list (for example).  I want to be able to define a hidden list on the page, and to show that list below the button on its click event, styled to look like a drop down menu.
[09:30:12] <mbroadst> most solutions I've seen want you to create the button using some method they define, but I'd prefer to keep the look and feel that I'm getting from other <button> elements next to this button
[09:31:51] <enjoycrf> omfg
[09:31:57] <helpcrypto> in fact, using firebug i see the servers answers
[09:32:05] <enjoycrf> im about to explode w diareah
[09:32:11] <helpcrypto> but as isnt a jsonp response, my method is never raised
[09:33:43] <ajpiano> helpcrypto: you can't do a cross-domain post
[09:33:56] <ajpiano> your best bet is to use some kind of server-side proxy that does the actual posting for you
[09:33:57] <helpcrypto> ajpiano: theres no way?
[09:34:06] <ajpiano> and request the local resource
[09:34:12] <ajpiano> ?sop workaround
[09:34:12] <bot-t> workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[09:34:13] <helpcrypto> its https, so i dont know if the server will like it
[09:34:22] <helpcrypto> (i.e.= headhache
[09:34:33] <ajpiano> as opposed to "doing something impossible?"
[09:34:40] <ajpiano> i'd go with the "something that might actually work" approach
[09:34:48] <ajpiano> that's just me though
[09:34:50] <snover> donâ€™t be such a realist ajpiano.
[09:34:53] <snover> a guy can dream!
[09:35:55] <helpcrypto> and...then...whats $.support.cors for?
[09:36:08] <ajpiano> does your server support CORS?
[09:36:38] <pachet> speaking of things that might actually not work
[09:36:39] <ajpiano> CORS, like JSONP, is not "magically turn on cross-domain support and make my life easy"
[09:36:45] <pachet> enjoycrf: http://jsfiddle.net/VMrus/
[09:36:53] <pachet> tested in ff, chrome, and ie9
[09:36:59] <pachet> probably breaks in earlier versions
[09:37:12] <ajpiano> pachet: enjoycrf is muted for the day
[09:38:06] <pachet> ++
[09:38:26] <helpcrypto> ajpiano: you think will be easier to request from the java server to a page that uses https???
[09:38:40] <helpcrypto> (which, by the way, is not mantained by us, so...no much control
[09:38:55] <ajpiano> helpcrypto: i assumed you had some sort of server that you could proxy it through
[09:38:59] <helpcrypto> using normal ajax+cors gives a permission denied error
[09:39:10] <ajpiano> if you don't have any control over the server, jsonp nor cors will just be a magic bullet
[09:39:25] <helpcrypto> using jsonp simply works, but the success function is never raised
[09:39:52] <ajpiano> helpcrypto: JSONP does a get, not a post
[09:39:55] <helpcrypto> i used firebug and noticed the server answer the proper html...
[09:40:37] <helpcrypto> its GET cross-domain allowed or either not?
[09:40:45] <helpcrypto> its GET cross-domain allowed or either? (*-not)
[09:40:47] <ajpiano> it's not an ajax request
[09:40:56] <ajpiano> so no, a cross-domain AJAX get is not allowed either
[09:40:57] <helpcrypto> Â¿?
[09:41:07] <ajpiano> read about what JSONP does i have to go celebrate the jewish new year apparently
[09:41:09] <ravenzz> it could be
[09:41:20] <ajpiano> helpcrypto: JSONP is creating a script tag on the fly
[09:41:21] <helpcrypto> ajpiano: have fun
[09:41:26] <zaf-Coral> Am using flot to generate bar graph, but the bars are always about 1-5px thick ... When I have 1 bar, its width takes up the whole canvas width.. I have tried setting the barWidth, any ideas ?
[09:41:41] <helpcrypto> ajpiano: then, thers no place to return the POST data
[09:42:07] <helpcrypto> ajpiano: could a "traditional" xmlhttprequest do the trick?
[09:42:09] <ravenzz> helpcrypto if the target server you are requesting allows you, It could be possible
[09:42:10] <ajpiano> no
[09:42:22] <ajpiano> all traditional XHRs cannot do cross-domain
[09:42:36] <helpcrypto> ravenzz: the target server its waiting for a simple POST form
[09:42:47] <ajpiano> JSONP is a workaround but it requires the server to actually return JSONP and it still doesn't simulate a POST
[09:43:08] <ajpiano> and the JSONP and CORS options to $.ajax are not "magically make the server do what it needs to do "
[09:43:12] <ravenzz> basically you should set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to yourdomain.com
[09:43:25] * helpcrypto sees the target=_bank"  approaching
[09:43:27] <ravenzz> on the target server
[09:43:33] <helpcrypto> *_blank
[09:43:55] <antihero> aaronmcadam: Wow, JSONP is just such a hilariously awesome trick.
[09:44:02] <antihero> Is most XSS done with something like that now?
[09:44:20] <ravenzz> it is not a tirck :|
[09:44:24] <ravenzz> trick
[09:44:25] <antihero> ravenzz: Oh okay :)
[09:44:43] <jugstah> I love how people call the office wanting to talk to me
[09:44:46] <jugstah> only to find out im deaf
[09:44:48] <antihero> tricks are what hoes do for money.....THIS IS AN ILLUSION
[09:44:49] <helpcrypto> mydomain.com is trying to send to https://cert.otherdomain.com some POST data, and receive the answer and parse the result
[09:45:10] <ravenzz> helpcrypto is cert.otherdomain.com yours?
[09:45:15] <helpcrypto> nop
[09:45:47] <ravenzz> then you can't, you need to setup a php/serverside proxy
[09:46:04] <helpcrypto> ravenzz: https on server side sux
[09:46:33] <ravenzz> Do they privide any kind of JSONP api?
[09:46:50] <ravenzz> provide
[09:47:04] <helpcrypto> nop...but the page is properly created with a jsonp request (using firebug)
[09:47:21] <ravenzz> which page? yours or their?
[09:47:29] <helpcrypto> my page send
[09:47:46] <helpcrypto> using firebug i see their page answered 200 (correct data on html)
[09:47:58] <helpcrypto> but my success function is never raised
[09:48:13] <snover> helpcrypto: no shit. jsonp requires the server to return a jsonp structure.
[09:48:26] <snover> it canâ€™t be used to retrieve whatever the fuck you feel like at a particular moment
[09:48:27] <snover> please read about it.
[09:48:33] <helpcrypto> snover: they dont do it...or my code will work
[09:48:49] <ravenzz> you can't retrieve data from them
[09:48:57] <snover> that sentence is not intelligible.
[09:49:24] <ravenzz> mine?
[09:49:33] <gnarf> snover: "they don't have jsonp, or my jsonp call would work" <--- my attempted translation
[09:49:41] <helpcrypto> mines
[09:50:01] <snover> landmines.
[09:50:15] <helpcrypto> anyway...i now see whts the problem
[09:50:18] * gnarf asplodes
[09:50:44] <helpcrypto> i think ill open that url on a new window
[09:50:55] <ravenzz> poor
[09:51:00] <helpcrypto> bastard
[09:51:02] <helpcrypto> :P
[09:51:11] <gnarf> OMG YOU KILLED KENNY
[09:51:15] <ravenzz> mahuhua
[09:51:20] <rgr> is there a way in jquery to set the min-height of an element to the size of any bg image applied to that element?
[09:51:41] <helpcrypto> ravenzz: ajpiano thx both of you
[09:51:58] <ravenzz> helpcrypto at this point is better tu use something like, fancybox instead of the new window solution
[09:52:03] <helpcrypto> you didnt solved my problem, but defined it as impossible by now
[09:52:10] <ravenzz> at least the visitors will not leave your website
[09:52:20] <helpcrypto> ravenzz: fancybox->iframe?
[09:52:26] <ravenzz> yes
[09:52:35] <robin_sz> so, I have this web page and want some jquery to do some stuff, which I havent quite decided what it is yet, can you write it for me?
[09:52:51] <gnarf> robin_sz: hell no
[09:53:01] <helpcrypto> ok...thx again
[09:53:05] <ravenzz> rgr i don't think so
[09:53:06] <helpcrypto> and have a good day
[09:53:40] <ravenzz> robin_sz #css-lance
[09:54:24] <jedimind_> lol robin_sz
[09:54:55] <pachet> rgr: you can, but you'd have to load the image independently and check the default height
[09:55:06] <pachet> then set the element min to that
[09:55:10] <rgr> thats what I thought. No, its set in css. No worries.
[09:55:13] <ravenzz> so he can't
[09:55:35] * robin_sz sighs
[09:55:45] <robin_sz> there went my development budget
[09:56:06] <rgr> ah yeah, I see. query the css for the background image name, the load it etc. Nah, too slow.
[09:56:25] <jedimind_> robin_sz, you ended up buying a coffee instead?
[09:56:43] <robin_sz> coke
[09:56:56] <robin_sz> more efficient, doesnt need to be heated
[09:57:08] <jedimind_> well, at least you'll be awake for a couple of days - plenty of time to code
[09:57:24] <robin_sz> days? ... you are crazy?
[09:57:33] <robin_sz> no one codes in the day
[09:57:39] <robin_sz> nights are where it is at!
[09:57:52] <pachet> my office doesnt put out coffee at night
[09:58:11] <robin_sz> how awful
[09:58:50] <robin_sz> presumbly they are worried the developers woudl stay all night and drink maybe $2 of coffee?
[09:58:57] <jedimind_> i meant with the amount of coke you bought, you keep yourself up and awake
[09:59:07] <robin_sz> jedimind_, exactly
[09:59:13] <jedimind_> ohh cocacola!
[09:59:19] <robin_sz> but not days, they are for sleeping
[09:59:51] <robin_sz> is now a good time to mention how great jsfiddle.net is?
[10:00:09] <pachet> i think its more just that the staff responsible for putting out the coffee go home
[10:00:17] <pachet> i cant be bothered to learn how to operate that damned coffee machine
[10:00:20] <pachet> it takes a wizard's skills
[10:00:31] <robin_sz> best avoided, order it in
[10:01:00] <kinga> if i have both complete and error function callbacks in .ajax()
[10:01:08] <kinga> and if a script error occurs (500 for eg)
[10:01:14] <kinga> will it fire both complete and error ?
[10:01:16] <kinga> or only error ?
[10:01:59] <mxms> Hey, i'm creating a page, where a wide div has to slide off the page to the left, and another one has to slide in from the right, any advice on doing this efficiently? without creating the div multiple times, and worrying about it being hidden or glitches?
[10:03:06] <robin_sz> mxms, so they just cycle through, one ofter the other, repeating the two divs?
[10:03:22] <mxms> more than 2, but yes.
[10:03:27] <pachet> kinga: both
[10:03:30] <pachet> error first, then complete
[10:06:34] <kinga> ok thanks, and i ahve another question
[10:07:26] <kinga> if i have a multiple selection from $() will the elements be in order like in the dom hierarchy  ?
[10:08:24] <pachet> depends on what your selector was
[10:08:31] <pachet> if it was a single class selector, then yeah
[10:09:04] <pachet> $('.foo,.bar') would add all the foos first, then the bars
[10:11:54] <Boosh1> Greetings.  I have a form that uses a link to submit.  Client asked for the form to submit when the user presses enter.  However, if the user is selecting a value previously entered and they press enter to select the value the form submits prematurely.  Anyone know of a way to stop that behavior?
[10:12:34] <kinga> pachet, single class selecter and thanks for the answer :)
[10:12:41] <kinga> selector*
[10:15:08] <pachet> yw :]
[10:16:35] <ck> ok i'm back with my fiddle
[10:16:37] <antihero> grr, trying to do regex string.replace on something but it seems to only do the first thing on a line
[10:16:37] <ck> http://jsfiddle.net/qV98D/
[10:16:41] <antihero> even if I use the /g switch
[10:17:33] <ck> i need this to not encode the < and > when setting the href attribute
[10:18:30] <csotelo> hello coders.... I would like to know if could be possible do an exteral js with this content $(document).ready(function(){/* My sentences go here */);
[10:19:25] <Paul_B_Hartzog> is there an IRC channel for JQuery UI ?
[10:19:42] <csotelo> hello? some one is here?
[10:20:10] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i is here
[10:20:11] <Paul_B_Hartzog> sup?
[10:20:13] <ck> nobody here
[10:22:30] <pachet> Paul_B_Hartzog: #jquery-ui
[10:22:39] <Paul_B_Hartzog> lol, thx
[10:22:39] <pachet> thats for development though
[10:22:46] <pachet> support questions should be asked here
[10:23:09] <Paul_B_Hartzog> k. i'll stay in here for the foreseeable future
[10:25:32] <antihero> nvm got it my regex was too greedy
[10:37:53] <Kronuz> hello
[10:38:24] <ck> anyone know how jquery handles encoding of values when using $(this).attr('href')?
[10:39:09] <Kronuz> I'm having this problem in IE7â€¦ in which I'm getting an exception from jQuery that says "e.type" can't be used â€¦this is because e is undefined. When or how can an event handler be (elemData.handle) be called with an undefined "e" parameter?
[10:47:39] <pachet> ck: jq doesnt encode
[10:47:44] <pachet> its probably your browser
[10:48:11] <ck> i don't think so
[10:48:21] <ck> i think it's happening when setting the href attr
[10:48:33] <ck> if the value has invalid tags
[10:49:49] <gnarf> Kronuz: version?
[10:52:05] <pachet> ck: http://jsfiddle.net/RZrMq/
[10:52:08] <pachet> the links look fine to me in FF
[10:52:13] <pachet> unencoded, that is
[10:52:21] <pachet> in IE9 they're encoded for both
[10:52:22] <pachet> hence
[10:52:30] <pachet> browser is applying the encoding
[10:52:30] <ck> even when mousing over the link? the url is okay?
[10:52:41] <pachet> yep
[10:52:45] <ck> odd
[10:53:00] <ck> ok well that explains it :)
[10:53:51] <kinga> anyone knows a composed logical expression (between two operands) that would yield the next table 0 1 1 0
[10:54:15] <kinga> 1*1 = 0; 1*0 = 1; 0*1 = 1; 0*0 = 0
[10:54:49] <kinga> ah, i think that would be XOR negated ?
[10:55:45] <ck> this is the scenario (it may help it makes sense). what i have is a search on our sites FAQ. i'm wrapping each found element with a <q></q> so i can style it. if the found string is in a URL I need to remove that tag from the href. I was using regex to do this, but in chrome it was encoding the < and > so my regex wasn't finding a match. i updated to this, which is now working, but wanted to
[10:55:45] <ck> know why...
[10:56:01] <kinga> oh, that's actually normal XOR lol
[10:56:03] <ck> url = $(this).attr("href");

[10:57:17] <Kronuz> gnarf: it's jQuery 1.5.3
[10:57:51] <Kronuz> but the event is being called with undefined (or no) parameter 'e'
[10:57:59] <Kronuz> (under IE7)
[10:58:22] <gnarf> Kronuz: try on 1.6.4 ?
[11:06:28] <g0bl1n> still wondering on why the browser won't open an attachment pulled via Ajax call, with all the headers well set...
[11:07:25] <g0bl1n> the url generates a pdf on the server, that is opened if inserted on the browser URL. If called with an ajax GET call, nothig happens
[11:08:13] <g0bl1n> the url may return a PDF or an error response, that ajax can manage very well. Only if it opened the PDF...
[11:08:52] <g0bl1n> success: function(data) {console.log(data);}  shows me the pdf data
[11:09:19] <g0bl1n> no solution here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[11:09:22] <ck> could be a cross domain issue?
[11:09:26] <g0bl1n> no
[11:09:35] <g0bl1n> same origin
[11:09:38] <ck> k
[11:09:41] <g0bl1n> ;)
[11:10:35] <g0bl1n> the browser receives the PDF data on the success callback. I can see it on the js console. I wonder why won't the browser deal with it. Chrome developer tools show the PDF application/pdf being downloaded.
[11:15:13] <pachet> wont work that way
[11:15:45] <pachet> best you can do is send back a link to where the temp file is remotely stored, or error out
[11:16:02] <pachet> then your ajax callback can window.location to that file link
[11:17:11] <g0bl1n> pachet, thanks, will go that approach. That way will be able to maintain error management
[11:17:50] <Guest12335> hi
[11:29:03] <tga> hello
[11:29:20] <pachet> +hi
[11:29:46] <tga> when I remove the focused element, the focus is just lost instead of passing to the next one
[11:30:09] <tga> is there some way I could fix that generically, without focusing something manually?
[11:31:42] <iroxoru> anyone know of a good way to create a custom scroller with jquery? or plugin?
[11:31:52] <iroxoru> so that a div can stay a certain size but you can scroll up/down
[11:31:58] <iroxoru> i was thinking about doing it in an iframe maybe
[11:32:05] <iroxoru> but the scroller won't look as good as jquery can usually do
[11:32:33] <tga> the iframe does sound like a good idea, a custom javascript scroller will be less usable
[11:32:49] <iroxoru> Hrmmm
[11:33:00] <Tmorrish> Anyone know if Jqurry has isses with Firefox 7 ?
[11:33:12] <iroxoru> im trying to copy http://www.pendaslaw.com/business_negligence.php
[11:33:25] <iroxoru> they have a little custom scroller there but I can't seem to copy/use the script myself
[11:33:36] <tga> iroxoru: that's exactly what I mean, that's a horrible scroller
[11:33:45] <iroxoru> ok so just iframe it
[11:33:46] <iroxoru> i guess
[11:34:18] <tga> best is to let it flow with the page
[11:34:22] <iroxoru> well
[11:34:26] <iroxoru> im actually upgrading that website
[11:34:27] <pachet> tga: not really a way to focus to next element programmatically
[11:34:28] <tga> in this case there is no reason for having a scroller/iframe
[11:34:33] <iroxoru> converting any flash to jquery
[11:34:33] <pachet> browsers dont generally expose the tab index
[11:34:51] <iroxoru> tga if you notice theres more text though
[11:34:54] <iroxoru> then the size of that box
[11:35:02] <iroxoru> and that box equals the size of the content selector to its left
[11:35:05] <tga> iroxoru: what I'd do is just keep the format but let the page flow naturally
[11:35:17] <iroxoru> would you extend the blue bar also?
[11:35:28] <tga> not necessarily
[11:35:32] <iroxoru> hmm
[11:35:33] <tga> but you could
[11:35:42] <iroxoru> ok well thanks for your opinion
[11:35:45] <iroxoru> much appreciated
[11:35:51] <tga> np
[11:36:16] <tga> pachet: then what options do I have for keeping my page usable after removing the focused element?
[11:39:09] <tga> http://imgur.com/QgMU9
[11:39:26] <tga> this is what my form looks like, the second row is actually a text input
[11:40:01] <tga> I am removing the buttons, and losing the focus too
[11:41:44] <aple> Do I need to use return false on .submit() or does it do it by itself?
[11:43:19] <nbst> Hey everyone.  I am using jKey (http://oscargodson.com/labs/jkey/) to detect certain key presses which I use to slide in and out certain divs.  In one of the divs is a form, and key presses in the input and textarea boxes that match the keys used for opening divs interfere and open the div in the middle of typing (and the key isn't actually inserted into the text boxes).  How can I fix this?
[11:43:27] <nbst> Am I doing something wrong with this :not() selector?
[11:43:28] <nbst> $(document + ':not(input)').jkey(
[11:43:42] <adrianp> aple: you need to return false if you want to prevent the form from submitting
[11:45:26] <adrianp> nbst: document?
[11:45:45] <nbst> document allows the key to be pressed anywhere the focus is in the document
[11:45:52] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i need a php script to only accept get/post from a specific jquery submit button
[11:45:54] <nbst> but I want except input's and textareas
[11:46:02] <Paul_B_Hartzog> does jquery ajax send any identifying info?
[11:46:51] <Raydiation> how do you organize your code? it seems that the more i write the uglier it gets
[11:48:46] <muzone> Raydiation: object literal styyyyyyyyyyyyle
[11:49:23] * muzone is now playing: Hugh Mundell - Can't Pop No Style 12" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FA1pTzZD9ox)
[11:50:18] <adrianp> nbst: $(document).is(":not(:input))").jkey...
[11:50:30] <pachet> tga: sorry for the late response
[11:50:32] <Raydiation> muzone: ?
[11:50:44] <pachet> you could override the default method for remove()?
[11:50:52] <pachet> something like http://jsfiddle.net/VVnjp/
[11:51:37] <pachet> that just focuses the next element of the same type as the removed element, but wouldnt be hard to make it a little smarter
[11:51:55] <muzone> Raydiation: http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2009/10/15/using-objects-to-organize-your-code
[11:52:24] <aple> Hey guys, I'm trying to use jQuery to serialize a form, then use AJAX to send it to a 2nd page, flip two words, and send it back. Anyone see what I'm doing wrong? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484661/
[11:52:30] <Tmorrish> anyone else know if there are issues with Datepicker and Firefox 7 ?
[11:52:30] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484659/
[11:53:00] <pachet> tga: what would be cleaner is to make your own jq method that focuses the next element, then call remove() within that
[11:53:24] <Ojje> Hi there. How can i make an eventlistener for textfield value change?
[11:53:29] <tga> interesting, focusing the next element automatically is probably what I want
[11:53:34] <nbst> adrianp: Hm now no keys work.  It seems you put an extra ending parentheses?  I tried it without that too
[11:53:41] <tga> I'll go try to adapt it
[11:53:43] <Ojje> tried .change, without success
[11:53:56] <adrianp> lol yeah
[11:54:15] <adrianp> nbst: $(document).is(":not(:input)").jkey(...
[11:54:27] <adrianp> or .not(":input")
[11:54:44] <tga> pachet: is there a way of catching .change() BEFORE .blur()?
[11:55:47] <adrianp> nbst: $(document).ready(function($){ $("#form_id").is(":not(:input)").jkey(...)});
[11:56:17] <nbst> Are you sure :input is a valid selector?
[11:56:18] <muzone> Vaerros :D
[11:56:20] <nbst> Wouldn't it just be input
[11:56:26] <Vaerros> muzone: hey
[11:56:26] <muzone> sup dude
[11:56:31] <Vaerros> nm
[11:56:37] <adrianp> nbst: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[11:56:45] <Vaerros> going to a concert later today(van hunt -- my fav. artist)
[11:56:48] <Raydiation> muzone: isnt that a perverted way to do clean coding?
[11:57:00] <muzone> awesome man
[11:57:11] <muzone> Vaerros: whens the new season of treme coming out you know?
[11:57:17] <Vaerros> lol
[11:57:20] <pachet> tga: not really, change depends on the blur event
[11:57:22] <muzone> Raydiation: perverted?
[11:57:30] <Vaerros> just b/c I live in southern louisiana, I'm supposed to know that?
[11:57:36] <adrianp> nbst: you should be using the ready() function to detect when DOM has fully loaded
[11:57:37] <muzone> hhhhhhhh :)
[11:57:41] <Raydiation> muzone: using objects as namespaces
[11:57:43] <tga> pachet: yeah, that screws me up with the focus because I add the "save" button only if the text is changed
[11:57:46] <pachet> ie, the js event "blur" is triggering the jq method "change"
[11:57:58] <muzone> Raydiation: i think it looks mighty fine
[11:58:07] <tga> pachet: so I have to add it on focus() no matter what because after change() the focus is gone
[11:58:09] <muzone> Raydiation: sexy as a matter of fact
[11:58:19] <Ojje> Is it possible to have an .change eventlistener on a hidden textifield?
[11:58:27] <muzone> ccmonster: tell it like it is bruh
[11:58:47] <jbrokc> i want to navigate to a sibling of a parent element. why doesn't $(this).closest("a.sibling") work? I guess closest only goes straight up the heirarchy. do I have to do $(this).parent().sibling("a.sibling") ?
[11:58:49] <pachet> tga: not sure without seeing your code. keyup maybe? ;o
[11:59:03] <nbst> adrianp: None of it is working. :/ Thanks for your help though
[11:59:12] <tga> pachet: humm, that would be an idea
[11:59:58] <adrianp> nbst: pastebin your code
[12:02:36] <nbst> http://pastebin.com/9Gh7sTMZ
[12:02:48] <nbst> jQuery 1.6.4 is being called in a header file
[12:03:50] <nbst> So to test it, you'll have to get all the files
[12:04:06] <nbst> I'm not really using any jQuery UI yet
[12:04:10] <nbst> so you'll just need jKey
[12:05:38] <aple> Can anyone help me? I'm trying to learn AJAX and I'm trying to serialize some form fields, send them to a php script, do stuff to them, send them back. It seems like it's going through, but it's not displaying in my #output div. serial.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484669/ flip_names.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484670/
[12:05:52] <aple> Would really appreciate any help. Can repay someone with some design work.
[12:06:57] <nbst> @aple Maybe the PHP isn't returning any data?
[12:07:46] <adrianp> nbst: http://pastebin.com/FSFR3Qu1
[12:07:49] <adrianp> put your stuff in the header
[12:08:01] <adrianp> <script>/<link>
[12:11:18] <adrianp> aple: add an alert("something " + data); in the ajax success callback
[12:11:31] <nbst> I tried the updated code and it doesn'tw ork
[12:12:30] <adrianp> nbst: install firebug and see if any scripts are throwing exceptions
[12:12:43] <Clex> adrianp: this kind of debug is better with a "dbg" <div> and $('#dbg').append()
[12:13:23] <adrianp> Clex: sure whatever works
[12:13:53] <aple> adrianp: I figured it out
[12:13:57] <adrianp> what was it?
[12:14:00] <aple> adrianp: I was trying to pass it as JSON
[12:14:00] <Clex> Sorry I really hate alert() :p
[12:14:04] <aple> dataType: 'json'
[12:14:18] <aple> Apparently when you serialize something, it's not turning it into JSON
[12:14:20] <aple> TIL
[12:14:31] <pachet> alert is situationally useful
[12:14:33] <pachet> quick and easy!
[12:14:43] <hdon_> hi all :) is jquery-ui included in jquery-mobile? does jquery-ui "compress" (concatenate?) all my HTML and JS into a single file for deployment?
[12:15:10] <Clex> pachet: only when you want to break the execution of your code.
[12:15:43] <pachet> exactly!
[12:16:04] <hdon_> (and css?)
[12:16:18] <Clex> hdon_: nope.
[12:17:30] <adrianp> aple: ah
[12:17:57] <hdon__> Clex: is it the general pattern of jquery-ui use that developers use their own tools to compress/concatenate their css and javascript? what do people usually do for HTML? the examples i've seen all author HTML using $('<htmlsnippets>') which seems like an underwhelming solution
[12:19:17] <Clex> hdon__: jquery and jquery-ui provide ".min" version of their libraries.
[12:19:19] <aple> What's the best way to do error handling with jQuery AJAX?
[12:19:30] <Connor__> More of a JS question but, is there a fully functioning cross browser version of window.requestAnimationFrame?
[12:19:43] <aple> $.ajax({ error: ????profit; });
[12:19:50] <Clex> hdon__: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js
[12:20:09] <aple> That is, what's the best way to return whatever error occurred via AJAX?
[12:20:50] <hdon__> Clex: sure, and i can minify my js as well, but what i wonder is what is the usual use case? do people use $('<htmlsnippets>')? CSS and JS concatenation and minification is pretty trivial i think i only asked out of an expectation that jquery-ui would have a single tool to do it all
[12:20:56] <pachet> Connor__: https://gist.github.com/838785
[12:21:25] <Connor__> Thanks Pachet
[12:22:07] <Clex> Oh, there's a bunch of js compressors on the internet.
[12:22:34] <pachet> hdon__: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-minifying
[12:22:46] <pachet> linkbot is linkbot ;o
[12:22:56] <hdon__> i'm not having trouble with JS or CSS. HTML is my main concern. i don't want my HTML to be inside my JS. it's a worse workflow :(
[12:23:17] <hdon__> pachet: that code looks a little silly. do you really need the inner function?
[12:23:38] <hdon__> window.requestAnimationFrame = (function(){...})()
[12:23:50] <hdon__> everything inside the dots should work without wrapping it in another function right?
[12:23:55] <erichynds> hdon__: use a templating system like handlebars or jquery templates
[12:24:02] <pachet> i didnt write it ;o
[12:24:08] <pachet> just fetched the link
[12:24:09] <hdon__> erichynds: thanks :) i will google that immediately!
[12:25:59] <hdon__> my solution before was a shell script that would wrap each HTML snippet file in a <div id=$filename style="display:none"></div> and concatenate it to one file, then duplicate the HTML i needed from the DOM, unless i had a singleton then i would just move the node and display it
[12:26:22] <hdon__> it's a crappy solution for various reasons :|
[12:27:24] <grange> I try to integrate imgAreaSelect and LightBox in my project. So the code from the developers page include calls on $('a[rel=lightbox]').lightBox(); and $('a[rel=lightbox]').click(show); But as I need to change the links dynamically, I tried a live-function like this: $("a[rel=lightbox]").live("click", function(){  It works so far, but I have no idea how to call lightBox() and show() inside the
[12:27:24] <grange> live function. Any help would be highly appreciated! thanks
[12:29:00] <pachet> hdon__ actually looked at the github link
[12:29:08] <pachet> that closure is a html5 polyfill
[12:30:23] <hdon__> pachet: i haven't heard that term before. it looks like feature-testing regular javascript to me
[12:32:16] <hdon__> return window.requestAnimationFrame = (window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame||window.mozRequestAnimationFrame||window.oRequestAnimationFrame||window.msRequestAnimationFrame||(function(cb){window.setTimeout(cb,1000/60)}))
[12:32:27] <hdon__> but, meh
[12:32:28] <hdon__> who cares
[12:32:47] <aple> Anyone know how to grab exceptions when errors are thrown in ajax?
[12:33:59] <hdon__> aple: you mean handle asynchronous errors? error objects are not typically used for asynchronous errors, neither is throwing.
[12:34:31] <hdon__> since the stack has unraveled by the time you can handle the next event (the asynchronous error)
[12:37:21] <Connor__> Hi guys. I have an animation, however when Ichange tabs the animation pauses and when I return to the page it screws up. I took a look at requestAnimationFrame but I am not sure if that is going to help me
[12:37:46] <timmywil> Connor__: which version of jQuery?
[12:37:53] <Connor__> 1.6.2
[12:38:02] <timmywil> updating to 1.6.4 will fix it
[12:39:37] <Connor__> Hm, its better but hasn't completley fixed the issue
[12:40:13] <aple> hdon_: I mean, any old error. I'd like to display it
[12:40:28] <timmywil> Connor__: it's up to the browser at that point
[12:40:31] <hdon__> aple: ok in $.ajax() there is a callback you can assign for errors
[12:40:33] <aple> Trying to figure out how to trouble shoot my ajax stuff while I'm learning it
[12:40:47] <Connor__> Argh, is there anyway i can detech when I am on another tab easily?
[12:40:48] <aple> hdon_: Yes, "error"
[12:40:58] <Connor__> I would just reset the animation to the beginning if I could
[12:41:12] <hdon__> aple: but there is no error object, not like "throw new Error('..')"
[12:41:19] <hdon__> aple: instead you have this: error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)Function
[12:41:28] <hdon__> whoops, didn't mean to copy Function
[12:41:31] <hdon__> aple: instead you have this: error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[12:41:41] <Eviltwin> hdon__: throw "Hello, World!" will work
[12:41:51] <timmywil> you can bind to window focus, but there's no way to tell the difference between the browser losing focus and switching tabs
[12:42:07] <hdon__> Eviltwin: don't know what that really accomplishes. don't really know where aple is going with his line of inquiry
[12:42:20] <Connor__> Hm okay
[12:42:21] <Connor__> Thanks
[12:42:33] <timmywil> and make sure to schedule new animations with complete callbacks rather than using setTimeouts
[12:43:56] <Connor__> Problem is, I want my animations calls to overlap
[12:44:02] <Connor__> I don't want them to call once it's finished
[12:44:08] <Connor__> Which I think is one of the bigger issues
[12:44:31] <timmywil> yea, that may have timing issues in the most modern browsers
[12:45:04] <aple> hdon_: I'm just trying to figure out if something is going wrong in my AJAX request, or if something's wrong in my .php script
[12:45:15] <Connor__> God dang it
[12:45:24] <aple> hdon_: Pretty much just trying to return whatever error ajax throws
[12:45:33] <gnarf> ?g page visibility api @Connor__
[12:45:35] <bot-t> Connor__, Using the Page Visibility API - Google Chrome - Google Code - http://code.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/pagevisibility.html
[12:45:40] <hdon__> aple: that's my point. XHR does not throw an error if it's asynchronous
[12:45:51] <hdon__> aple: it will provide you with error data if you provide an error callback
[12:45:54] <aple> Bleh, crap. What does "error" do then?
[12:46:07] <aple> Hm, so I need to provide functions for each possible error?
[12:46:09] <Connor__> Ooo
[12:46:09] <hdon__> aple: it gives you error data. it is not a thrown exception
[12:46:12] <Connor__> Thanks gnarf
[12:46:24] <gnarf> Connor__: its WG draft so
[12:46:25] <gnarf> ...
[12:46:35] <gnarf> use at risk - but where supported it should work well
[12:46:37] <hdon__> aple: that's up to you. you could handle all errors the same if you want. there's also a place in jquery where you can catch all .ajax errors with thes ame function
[12:46:42] <Connor__> It's definatly a start
[12:46:49] <gnarf> and luckilly, where its supported is also where you'll have issues with out of frame timeouts
[12:47:05] <hdon__> aple: if you are just troubleshooting, i highly recommend using your browser's built-in XHR debugging features. what browser are you using?
[12:47:18] <mikesm_> Anyone know how I can change an event.which to something else? i.e. if I user pressed 'a' say I wanted it to press 'b' instead
[12:48:10] <aple> hdon_: FF for dev
[12:48:24] <hdon__> aple: ok are you using Firebug?
[12:48:41] <mikesm_> event.which = .... wouldn't work, but something that gives the same functionality
[12:49:34] <grange> Could anybody help me with the following problem? what should the call $('a[rel=lightbox]').lightBox(); look like inside a live-function? messing around for ages now :/
[12:51:21] <hdon__> aple: are you using firebug or firefox's new built-in developer tools?
[12:51:26] <aple> hdon_: Firebug ;)
[12:51:29] <aple> Console
[12:51:58] <hdon__> aple: ok, click on the little drop-down menu triangle/arrow next to the word Console in the console tab. there is an option to display XHRs. make sure that is enabled
[12:52:14] <hdon__> aple: when you use $.ajax(), if it gets as far as making an XHR request, it will show up as a line in your console
[12:52:24] <Dave_Stein> i have 8 minutes to help out
[12:52:26] <Dave_Stein> help me help you
[12:52:26] <hdon__> aple: after it shows up as a line, you can inspect it to see exactly what happened by interacting with its user interface
[12:52:27] <Dave_Stein> :)
[12:52:38] <hdon__> Dave_Stein: how do you /quit ?
[12:52:53] <Dave_Stein> ha
[12:54:58] <aple> hdon_: Well, just realized my question was silly and any error handling needs to be done server side
[12:55:06] <aple> hdon_: But thanks for sticking it out with me
[12:55:23] <hdon__> aple: np. it can suck to debug that stuff until you get the hang of it. then that part is easy :)
[12:56:07] <aple> Anyone know if there is a plugin or something to actually show progress of an operation?
[12:56:22] <aple> Something like Flash's download bars - for JS though
[12:56:46] <Dave_Stein> apl: there is a progress bar in jquery ui

[12:57:25] <Dave_Stein> widths of a tab?
[12:57:30] <jeffsmykil> no the widths of like the space between tabs
[12:57:35] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[12:57:48] <Dave_Stein> settings -> preferences -> language Menu / tab settings
[12:57:57] <Dave_Stein> i check off replace by space and make tab size 2
[12:58:00] <iroxoru> oh the actual program notepad ++
[12:58:28] <jeffsmykil> somehow mine got set to 8 :/
[12:58:30] <jeffsmykil> ugh
[12:58:43] <Dave_Stein> ouch
[12:58:51] <Dave_Stein> any im off for now
[12:58:57] <jeffsmykil> ty
[13:17:51] <Raydiation> is xml preferred over json?
[13:18:20] <Raydiation> plus is this the right way to parse xml? kinda looks fishy : $(xml).find('site').each(function(){
[13:21:12] <sean``> Raydiation, I prefer json
[13:31:00] <jedimind_> hey, im trying to pass a regexp from a data- attribute on an element into my js function, but it doesnt know to treat it as a regular expression
[13:31:03] <jedimind_> what am i missing
[13:32:49] <jedimind_> <input ... data-validate='{"regexp":" .... "}'> and then just validate.regexp as a crude example
[13:35:39] <richardr> If I use .append(), to append a '<div class="block"></div>', is there any way I can track this specific element so I can destroy it after a couple of operations? (note: there might be other <div class="block"></div> in the DOM
[13:35:47] <pachet> how are you using the expression? .match()? new RegExp()?
[13:38:32] <pachet> richardr: can you assign it to a variable?
[13:38:42] <ravenzz> it is not a good idea to use a link to submit the form
[13:39:06] <ravenzz> oh sorry bad channel
[13:40:16] <kadnare> Hello, how can I get all of the classes of an element in an array?
[13:40:46] <AliG1000> I'm trying to daisy-chain two lines of jQuery and put a delay on one so that it shows up for longer.  But the following doesn't work:
[13:40:51] <AliG1000>         $('#slider_result').delay(5000).html('<img src="/images/loading.gif" /> Checking...');
[13:40:57] <AliG1000> 		$('#slider_result').html('<img src="/images/tick.png" /> <span class="is_available">updated</span>');
[13:41:16] <AliG1000> anyone have any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[13:41:36] <AliG1000> it's like the first line gets ignored completely
[13:42:16] <kanzie> so if I understand the module-pattern correctly I have my application as one module, in this module I define each class I have as a function to get a class-based index in my jsDoc. In each file I extend these classes with additional functions and local fields. Then I use a shorthand for my namespace to not get to long handlers for my different classes. Since Im trying to have a MVC separation should I do this in each class like,
[13:42:16] <kanzie> MyModule.View.User.init MyModule.Model.User.bar or MyModule.User.init give MyModule.User.View.foo MyModule.User.View.bar etc.
[13:43:06] <Tobsn> kanzie, and all abstract from a base class ;)
[13:43:43] <pachet> AliG1000: delay works on the animation queue by default, which html() isn't a part of
[13:44:31] <AliG1000> pachet: is there any way I can display that loading.gif for a giveb time period?
[13:44:38] <ravenzz> richardr http://jsfiddle.net/SGfRF/ ?
[13:44:49] <AliG1000> given
[13:45:56] <kanzie> does jQuery still have a set of unit-tests that you can run
[13:46:00] <kanzie> last I found was for 1.3.2
[13:46:32] <richardr> ravenzz: thank you, that's what I was after.
[13:47:08] <richardr> ravenzz: (just creating this element so I can get elements off CSS and do some calculations, i dont need the actual element)
[13:48:48] <AliG1000> kadnare: i think the answer to your question lies somewhere in the comments section of here: http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[13:49:08] <pachet> kadnare: http://jsfiddle.net/KtfTV/
[13:50:38] <pachet> or http://jsfiddle.net/eWVQg/ probably makes more sense
[13:51:24] <Connor__> how can I set a var so it never changes?
[13:51:44] <AliG1000> pachet: damn you're fast! :)
[13:54:15] <pachet> AliG1000: you should use setTimeout i guess
[13:54:23] <pachet> something to the effect of: http://jsfiddle.net/6fDCH/
[13:56:13] <kadnare> How come something like $("p")[i].attr(); won't work?
[13:56:30] <pachet> Connor__: constant variables arent part of the current ecmascript
[13:56:42] <Connor__> Hm okay
[13:57:17] <Connor__> Just trying to write a little caching system for my plugin but it's not going well :P
[13:57:24] <ericslaw> I am trying to use the minimum about of jquery code to accept a drop event on an object on a page.   The object dropped is from another browser (like an image url or html link)
[13:57:27] <Connor__> At the moment it's crasing chrome and now the page won't even load :D
[13:57:46] <AliG1000> pachet: works perfectly, thankyou
[13:57:50] <ericslaw> any way to prevent the dropped link from replacing my entire browser page?
[13:58:08] <pachet> kadnare: because the jquery object isnt an array
[13:58:18] <pachet> and there's no property i
[13:58:40] <pachet> use eq() instead, $('p').eq(i).attr()
[13:59:29] <kadnare> Thanks pachet
[14:00:45] <Connor__> Hey Pachet, think you could help me out?
[14:01:06] <rt10k> if i have <div class="thingname"><span>text i don't want</span>text i want</div> <-- how can i grab only "text i want"
[14:01:23] <pachet> i'll try ;D
[14:01:29] <pachet> running back and forth between offices
[14:01:35] <pachet> almost yabba dabba doo time ;o
[14:01:43] <Connor__> Fair enough :P Thanks! Here is a demo of my current plugin
[14:01:44] <Connor__> http://development.connorburton.com/Half-Carousel/
[14:02:04] <Connor__> The logic of my new parts of code is that if you return to this tab with the animation on
[14:02:07] <rt10k> $('.thingname').text() contains the contents of the span, too, which i don't want. i want to omit the contents of the span
[14:02:08] <Connor__> It resets the plugin
[14:02:37] <Connor__> However, as the image dimensions are pretty much constantly animating I need to cache them and then animate (when you return to the page)
[14:02:55] <Connor__> However if you change tabs and return to my page, and then view the console log
[14:02:58] <Connor__> I get an error
[14:03:06] <Connor__> Which is the bit I am stuck on
[14:06:05] <kadnare> attr("class") returns all the classes as a string, is there a method similar to attr("class") that returns an array instead?
[14:06:40] <Connor__> Does it return them with spaces inbetween?
[14:06:42] <pachet> Connor__: browser tabs, you mean? i'm having a hard time replicating the issue : /
[14:06:51] <Connor__> Yes sorry, only works on Chrome
[14:07:14] <Connor__> @rt10k you can try detatching span, grabbing .text() and then re-inserting the span
[14:08:00] <ericslaw> ahh, found nuance in answer here: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/01/10/cross-browser-html5-drag-and-drop/ looks like I must have a dragover event before 'drop' will work
[14:08:58] <kadnare> Connor, thanks. I forgot all about the split method. :)
[14:09:07] <Connor__> :)
[14:09:37] <Connor__> I literally used it like 10 mins ago so ^^
[14:11:21] <acidjazz> .split ftw
[14:17:41] <Kre10s_> OK! so i'm working on a library browser... I have a fixed width div that is supposed to hold the library contents, with a scrollbar to look at more...
[14:18:15] <pachet> Connor__ : back, sorry
[14:18:20] <Connor__> No probs
[14:18:24] <Kre10s_> the library holds lots of items, and I want to use ajax to load them dynamically. how would i go about doing this?
[14:18:31] <Connor__> I was investigating my dogs ability to hunt spiders
[14:18:32] <pachet> it looks like you're not returning anything from cacheOriginalDimensions
[14:18:35] <Connor__> So it's all good
[14:18:39] <Connor__> Oh wow
[14:18:42] <Connor__> I am an idito :P
[14:18:42] <pachet> so when you set wrapperChildrenCachedDimensions
[14:18:47] <pachet> it just gets set to the array :D
[14:18:48] <pachet> er
[14:18:50] <pachet> function rather
[14:19:02] <Connor__> I see, I shall try returning the array. Thanks! :d
[14:19:03] <Connor__> :d
[14:19:07] <Connor__> ...
[14:19:09] <Connor__> :D
[14:19:12] <pachet> np :D
[14:19:29] <khmer> anyone ever used jquery.postMessage?
[14:19:56] <brl0> does jquery ui intentionally fire $(document).ready() events inside of tab panes when the tab gets focus?
[14:20:27] <pachet> bbl
[14:21:17] <Raydiation> why do i get missing : after property id at line 100 http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484753/
[14:21:21] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile 1.0 RC1 Released! Our first stable release candidate is now out for final testing. http://t.co/7vggwLJk â˜… http://bit.ly/q4MrKj
[14:21:32] <Connor__> Apparently trying to cache and animate the same property at once crashes tabs :)
[14:21:49] <VeXii> Raydiation remove the , at like 104
[14:22:09] <VeXii> IE gets emo if you finish youre object literrals whith a ,
[14:22:34] <VeXii> ohh and youre using wrong syntax in the obj aswell
[14:24:05] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Thanks to all hard-working contributors and the core team members for closing such a massive list to bugs in just 3 weeks since Beta 3. â˜… http://bit.ly/nE5xXL
[14:24:17] <Raydiation> VeXii: wrong syntax, where?
[14:24:47] <VeXii> look at my replay on the site
[14:25:43] <VeXii> object litterals is { fu: bar(), fa: baz()}
[14:26:35] <Raydiation> VeXii: sry, cant see a reply
[14:27:11] <Raydiation> VeXii: you mean: progress_query_init: function() {
[14:28:08] <Kre10s_> How would i make a library viewer, where items are loaded dynamically?
[14:28:55] <Kre10s_> say there are 2000 items in the library. i can only show 6 at a time. but need a scrollbar for all 2000...
[14:30:01] <dogarrhea2> hrm alert($(#someelement).offset()); <------ prints out null. google chrome in mac
[14:30:59] <ravenzz> dogarrhea2 the selector should be quoted
[14:31:06] <ravenzz> $('#someelement')
[14:31:14] <dogarrhea2> yea it's got quotes.
[14:31:20] <dogarrhea2> in the real code. but still prints null
[14:31:27] <dogarrhea2> it wouldn't even print anything without them
[14:31:34] <airstrike> hello everyone
[14:31:49] <airstrike> i'm facing a strange error that i can't quite put my finger on
[14:32:17] <ravenzz> dogarrhea2 also offset() returns an object
[14:32:25] <airstrike> i have a function called group_rows() which basically does an aggregate of values in a table, and adds a new row with the resulting sum. all works fine the *first* time i call it..
[14:32:35] <airstrike> but if i call it again, the page reloads and i see a weird message that starts with "function (selector, context)..."
[14:32:43] <dogarrhea2> ravenzz, apparently in this case it returns null
[14:32:55] <ravenzz> can you provide a  ?demo
[14:32:57] <ravenzz> ?demo
[14:32:57] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:33:25] <airstrike> @ravenzz who, me?
[14:33:52] <ravenzz> both of you
[14:34:15] <khmer> okay why can't i get window.postMessage to work on chrome
[14:35:31] <airstrike> fixed!
[14:35:49] <airstrike> i was trying to implement a new function for arrays by setting using Array.prototype
[14:35:53] <VeXii> Raydiation: sry where afk for a sek :p
[14:36:04] <airstrike> it wasn't working for some reason, so I just made it a function that takes an array as its first argument
[14:36:19] <VeXii> Raydiation its youre config object thats wrong
[14:36:50] <riyonuk> How would I test $(document).ready without refreshing the page each time?
[14:37:11] <necromancer> riyonuk: what are you trying to test?
[14:37:27] <Raydiation> VeXii: what would be the correct syntax? i got it form http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2009/10/15/using-objects-to-organize-your-code
[14:37:28] <VeXii> Raydiation: set the proppertys like {scanUpdInterval : 5000, $scannedScanned : $("#scanned"))
[14:37:28] <riyonuk> necromancer: im trying to get images to fade in, once the page loads.
[14:37:35] <airstrike> assuming I have strings 'Bus Trip', 'Bus Driver', 'Bus Disc', what's the fastest way to fetch 'Bus D' (meaning the part of the string which they have in common)?
[14:37:50] <airstrike> sorry, "Bus" would be the correct answer
[14:37:51] <airstrike> :S
[14:37:59] <VeXii> Raydiation: youre almost right on whith it
[14:38:47] <airstrike> guess what, found an amazing link for my question
[14:38:47] <airstrike> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1916218/find-the-longest-common-starting-substring-in-a-set-of-strings
[14:38:48] <necromancer> riyonuk: well, $(document).ready *works*. there's no need to test that. what you can do is open up Firebug and paste the line of JS that fades in the images inside the console, and see what happens
[14:39:00] <dogarrhea2> ok fixed it ravenzz
[14:39:05] <dogarrhea2> was missing an identifier
[14:39:10] <riyonuk> necromancer: that's an idea. alright :p
[14:39:26] <necromancer> riyonuk: if firebug returns jQuery ( )
[14:39:31] <necromancer> then your selector is blank
[14:39:43] <necromancer> err, meaning you didn't select anything. so your selector isn't working
[14:39:55] <Raydiation> VeXii: i dont see the difference, thats what i fixed http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484758/ error is the same. am i not allowed to make linebreaks?
[14:40:21] <VeXii> youre using = and not :
[14:40:33] <riyonuk> necromancer: woah
[14:40:34] <Raydiation> VeXii: ty!
[14:40:37] <riyonuk> necromancer: $('img').fadeTo("slow", 0.6); = awesome XD
[14:40:55] <VeXii> while betwen { } youre in objLit syntax land :p
[14:42:01] <necromancer> yup :)
[14:42:07] <Raydiation> VeXii: oversaw the = im used to this from oop :)
[14:42:31] <VeXii> Raydiation: you get used to it dw :)
[14:42:40] <Raydiation> well error messages could be better too :)
[14:43:16] <VeXii> well think only visual studio gave me "good" error messages when i where leaning code
[14:43:37] <VeXii> but it gets better the 15x time you fix it
[14:43:47] <gnarf> jQuery Mobile - RC 1 http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/09/29/jquery-mobile-1-0rc1-released/
[14:44:35] <celestius> Do the animation functions make heavy use of clone() ?
[14:44:45] <celestius> (doing some profiling)
[14:44:54] <gnarf> celestius: um
[14:44:59] <gnarf> celestius: what animations functions?
[14:45:12] <gnarf> celestius: jQuery core animation does not .clone() ever
[14:45:29] <celestius> we're doing a bunch of CSS repositioning, mostly
[14:45:40] <gnarf> .animate() never clones
[14:45:54] <sean`> clonamiate
[14:46:07] <gnarf> grep clone src/effects.js -- no results
[14:46:16] <celestius> ok, that's good, i should probs be able to optimize this then
[14:46:51] <celestius> ty gnarf
[14:46:54] <gnarf> celestius: on the other hand, if you're using certain jQuery UI effects, there might be some .clone()s
[14:47:00] <celestius> oh ok
[14:47:06] <gnarf> like explode
[14:47:06] <celestius> hm
[14:47:14] <gnarf> um
[14:47:22] <celestius> no, just dropping some pins on a map and fading some things in and out
[14:47:38] <gnarf> yeah - only explode
[14:49:23] <dogarrhea2> is there any feature that allows you to find the mouse coordinates relative to a particular element you have clicked?
[14:49:54] <dogarrhea2> it looks like jquery is telling us to use pageX and pageY, but I just wanted to confirm.
[14:51:24] <gnarf> dogarrhea2: yeah, use those event props, compare to see ?offset
[14:51:25] <bot-t> dogarrhea2, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[14:54:48] <riyonuk> necromancer: I don't see anything wrong with this code, yet it doesn't work. http://d.pr/yA0q
[14:55:53] <dogarrhea2> this functionality has probably done to death: how do you addchild to where the user clicks ?
[14:56:11] <necromancer> ?append
[14:56:11] <bot-t> .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:56:25] <necromancer> $('where-the-user-clicks').append(anotherElement);
[14:57:00] <dogarrhea2> necromancer, that's too coarse
[14:57:03] <necromancer> or, in better terms: $('clickable').click(function() { $(this).append(anotherElement); });
[14:57:10] <necromancer> "coarse"?
[14:57:20] <necromancer> i have never heard that term applied to programming before
[14:57:22] <necromancer> what does that mean
[14:57:28] <dogarrhea2> the image might be to the right or the left of the mouse
[14:57:33] <dogarrhea2> i want it right where the mouse is.
[14:58:26] <dogarrhea2> say, the middle of the image/element i want to add is under the mouse pointer after i click.
[14:59:05] <necromancer> dogarrhea2: you'd probably have to absolutely position it
[14:59:19] <necromancer> then just give it a top/left value equal to the mouse pos on the screen
[15:00:08] <bencc> when using $(#some-el).append('html...') how can I know when the dom is updated and I can use the appended element?
[15:07:20] <mastermaw> hello all
[15:07:23] <mastermaw> i'm going mental
[15:07:39] <mastermaw> i'm using jquery + form plugin
[15:07:48] <mastermaw> posting to my php page
[15:07:53] <mastermaw> hang, will pastebin
[15:08:32] <mastermaw> actually, just simply, using json to return some values from my php page
[15:08:43] <mastermaw> $jsonArray["html"] = "There has been an error";
[15:08:52] <mastermaw> that works
[15:09:11] <mastermaw> $jsonArray["html"] = "<div class=\"success\"><img src=\"gfx/tick.png\"/> You have updated your details</div><BR/>";
[15:09:15] <mastermaw> gives me a parseerror
[15:09:31] <SEJeff_work> I'm assuming you're doing that from php?
[15:09:34] <mastermaw> yes
[15:09:42] <SEJeff_work> Doesn't php have a json serializer?
[15:09:50] * SEJeff_work is a python and django guy, not a php guru
[15:10:51] <SEJeff_work> mastermaw, http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[15:12:18] <mastermaw> had a look
[15:12:25] <mastermaw> still can't see what the problem is
[15:12:48] <SEJeff_work> You haven't explained your problem fully
[15:13:01] <SEJeff_work> Getting a parse error in php? If so, you're in the wrong place
[15:13:10] <mastermaw> no, a parse error in jquery
[15:13:33] <SEJeff_work> mastermaw, Ok, please put a reproducer up on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[15:13:46] <mastermaw> righto
[15:15:01] <dogarrhea2> cool that works necromancer
[15:15:23] <dogarrhea2> btw coarse means too approximate. not specific enough
[15:15:32] <dogarrhea2> well not really
[15:15:39] <SEJeff_work> mastermaw, In your php, why don't you use single quotes? Then you wouldn't have to escape all of the double quotes, right?
[15:16:02] <dogarrhea2> but imagine grinding pepper.  how small do you want the ground up pieces to be?  the bigger the pieces are in general, the more coarse it is
[15:18:03] <oojacoboo> where am I screwing up with this?
[15:18:04] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/gZgKq/
[15:18:32] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: that's not really enough code for us to know
[15:18:38] <oojacoboo> I'm trying to use that var in another if statement below, but getting undef var
[15:18:56] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: only declare the variable once
[15:19:17] <pifantastic> although the way you have it shouldnt hurt anything
[15:19:28] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: thats because the value is neither of those two caes
[15:19:28] <oojacoboo> OH, soâ€¦. var structureTitle = if(
[15:19:32] <eddiemonge> *cases
[15:19:41] <pifantastic> you also dont need a semicolon the if statement
[15:19:51] <oojacoboo> ok
[15:19:59] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: why's that?
[15:20:05] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: yeah, the way you have it, this = window
[15:20:09] <oojacoboo> how would I go about writing this correctly :/
[15:20:17] <eddiemonge> you are saying if this ... else if this ... else (nothing)
[15:20:17] <oojacoboo> oh...
[15:20:21] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: what are you trying to do?
[15:20:39] <oojacoboo> change the value of the var I am setting based on the rel of the trigger
[15:20:59] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: so how about you start by showing us all of the code
[15:21:05] <pifantastic> instead of this out of context snippet
[15:21:10] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/gZgKq/1/
[15:21:50] <pifantastic> getting closer!
[15:21:55] <pifantastic> need a bit of HTML
[15:22:08] <oojacoboo> <a href=" rel="whatever">this</a>
[15:22:09] <pifantastic> and how about including jQuery using the sidebar
[15:22:23] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: if you want good help, you have to make good fiddles
[15:22:43] <oojacoboo> yea, thought this would be a quick answer
[15:22:44] <oojacoboo> one min
[15:22:46] <eddiemonge> why are you using rel anyway
[15:22:48] <eddiemonge> ?
[15:23:06] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I didn't make that call, prob should just use a random attr
[15:23:14] <pifantastic> oojacoboo: yeah, using data-FOO would be cleaner
[15:23:18] <eddiemonge> like data-attr="
[15:23:23] <oojacoboo> not my call
[15:23:30] <oojacoboo> agreed though
[15:23:33] <eddiemonge> pifantastic: damnit stop being such a fast typer
[15:23:56] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: like i tell everyone else, make it your call. dont propagate using bad stuff. be the catalyst for change
[15:24:11] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/gZgKq/2/
[15:24:22] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: that sounds nice
[15:24:28] <oojacoboo> I have too many things that are my call already
[15:24:35] <oojacoboo> I can't micro manage to this level
[15:26:47] <eddiemonge> you also have a typo = hide-strucutre
[15:27:00] <oojacoboo> fuck
[15:27:02] <oojacoboo> :P
[15:27:18] <oojacoboo> still not the issue
[15:27:57] <oojacoboo> actuallyâ€¦ it's working now...
[15:28:27] <oojacoboo> bingo
[15:28:44] <oojacoboo> for the recordâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/gZgKq/3/
[15:29:16] <oojacoboo> thanks eddiemonge  et pifâ€¦ (left chan I can't autocomplete now)
[15:29:52] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: curious though, surely there is a better way to write that
[15:29:58] <oojacoboo> two if statements seems nasty!
[15:32:47] <dogarrhea2> shoot. ie 8 has some unintended consequences of adding an absolutely positioned element as a child.
[15:33:05] <eddiemonge> well if you were using something like data-foo then you could do:  var struct = $('ele').data('foo') === 'hidestruct' ? true : false;
[15:33:23] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: is the parent positioned relatively?
[15:33:32] <starsinmypockets> Can anyone recommend a jquery plugin to help achieve this: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2udu9n4&s=7
[15:34:25] <IamTrying> How can i on click make the image waves or shakes ? e.g : $('img').click(function() { });
[15:34:58] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge, there is no explicit positioning applied to it. the element is inline-block
[15:35:19] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: slightly better but not much http://jsfiddle.net/gZgKq/4/
[15:35:21] <dogarrhea2> (the parent that is)
[15:35:52] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: add position: relative; or do you want the child element positioned in relation to the window and not the parent?
[15:36:51] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yea, I see, you just put it within the original if
[15:36:58] <oojacoboo> I thought about that...
[15:37:13] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge, the goal is to put the child element where the mouse clicks.
[15:37:15] <oojacoboo> not really any cleaner
[15:38:32] <dogarrhea2> right now i'm doing this by adding child to the element that i click
[15:42:02] <dogarrhea2> i will try adding child using absolute positioning to the outside div that contains all the hit targets rather than adding child to the hit targets themselves
[15:45:04] <widoz> hi some one help me about fancybox? i want to set elastic and swing, i'm done, but effect don't work
[15:46:10] <dogarrhea2> ok adding child to the outside div seems to work.  hopefully i won't find trouble in other browsers
[15:54:47] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[15:58:49] <ericslaw> I'm trying to drop an anchor link from another browser onto a dom object, how do I get the URL of the dropped link? I cannot find it in the event structure
[16:00:09] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. I have a simple hover animation that fades a div in and out based on mouse position, but it ends up queuing up multiple instances of the animation if you mouse over it quickly.
[16:00:43] <Whirl3d> Any good suggestions for stopping that? I tried to use dequeue, but it's not really working for me.
[16:01:32] <eddiemonge> ericslaw: you want to do what now?
[16:02:02] <Whirl3d> sorry, nvm. it's stop(true) ....
[16:02:14] <ericslaw> I want to drag anchor links (a href=...) from one browser window to another... I can get the drop event fine, but dont know what was dropped
[16:03:01] <ericslaw> I have little to no control over the remote window, but know that it contains images or anchors that represent URLs... I just need to know which URL was dropped on my object
[16:04:07] <ericslaw> many browsers will expand an anchor or image into the URL for input elements, but this is just a div in my case
[16:11:52] <eddiemonge> then use an input
[16:14:19] <ericslaw> the object I'm dropping on isnt an input, it is a canvas div which also accepts other events... maybe overlap it with a transparent textarea that bubbles up all other events?  I"m not sure that is going to work
[16:19:20] <ericslaw> hmmmm found demo of drop code that does what I want without an input: http://jsbin.com/uzovu  lets hope I learn something
[16:24:44] <ericslaw> darn, learned that the jsbin drop demo only works on chrome (not FF3.6)

[16:52:08] <bakers> Can I not use timeout with async: false in ajax?
[16:52:24] <abjorn> well
[16:52:25] <abjorn> i mean
[16:52:25] <imsky> abjorn: lolol
[16:52:26] <abjorn> you CAN
[16:52:27] <abjorn> but
[16:52:32] <abjorn> it wont work like you expect bakers
[16:52:39] <abjorn> unless you know what to expect in which case
[16:52:42] <abjorn> itll work exactly like you expect
[16:53:05] <abjorn> hell, for all I know you are jesus, so maybe you know everything
[16:53:10] <abjorn> im tired
[16:53:12] <bakers> I want to make a request to a port I KNOW is blocked, with a timeout of 1000 and have it error after that
[16:53:20] * bakers is not Jesus
[16:53:25] <abjorn> that seems like
[16:53:28] <abjorn> an odd thing to want to do
[16:53:35] <abjorn> I mean, call me crazy but
[16:53:39] <abjorn> that just seems like wanting an error
[16:53:45] <bakers> abjorn: I agree it's odd, but I'm trying an HTML based port knocking thing
[16:53:52] <abjorn> oic
[16:53:53] <abjorn> makes sense the
[16:53:54] <abjorn> n
[16:53:55] <bakers> connect to port 100, get denied
[16:53:56] <bakers> try 200
[16:53:57] <bakers> etc
[16:54:04] <imsky> you're building a portscanner?
[16:54:05] <bakers> abjorn: http://www.web-ster.com/bakers/knock.html
[16:54:11] <abjorn> no, no imsky
[16:54:12] <bakers> Not a port scanner, a port knocker
[16:54:12] <abjorn> a port
[16:54:13] <abjorn> "knocker"
[16:54:18] <abjorn> big difference
[16:54:21] <imsky> is there?
[16:54:21] <abjorn> big big difference
[16:54:25] <abjorn> no, no there is not.
[16:54:28] <bakers> No there isn't :P
[16:54:40] <bakers> Why you click on that button it knocks
[16:54:41] <imsky> damn script kiddiez
[16:54:58] <bakers> it SHOULD timeout after 1000 ms but it doesn't seem to be working?
[16:55:39] <imsky> you probably want synchronous requests, amirong?
[16:55:54] <abjorn> I'd help you but I think I'd end up just having to give support for someone your application is knocking on.
[16:56:03] <bakers> imsky: I don't think so... I want to knock on port 100, wait 1 second, then knock on port 200, etc
[16:56:06] <abjorn> "sir plz this ip is spamming my websights"
[16:56:07] <imsky> he's writing a chat app, abjorn
[16:56:20] <abjorn> SURE HE IS
[16:56:20] <abjorn> SURE
[16:56:46] <abjorn> lol someone came in today
[16:56:46] <imsky> bakers: wat about latency
[16:57:07] <abjorn> sir plz my some ip is spamming /myadmin, /phpmyadmin, bla bla trying to access
[16:57:19] <bakers> imsky: latency?
[16:57:38] <imsky> i mean does this whole device depend on there being literally 1 SECOND between requests
[16:57:48] <imsky> or can it be anywhere from 1 second to 65 years
[16:58:14] <abjorn> 65 years? what about 56k users
[16:58:18] <bakers> imsky: 1 to 60 seconds
[16:58:41] <imsky> bakers: are you using ben alman's elegant doTimeout?
[16:58:54] <imsky> i spoke to crockford, they're gonna replace setTimeout with alman's stuff
[16:59:06] <imsky> ben alman is taking over the future
[16:59:10] <Spadeski> sweet got pagination setup woh woh
[16:59:10] <bot-t> (37 hours 30 mins ago) <coldhead> tell Spadeski sorry i couldn't help with your logic problem! when i finally had time to ask about it you were gone :(
[16:59:17] <abjorn> ben alman you say?
[16:59:33] <bakers> imsky: doTimeout?
[16:59:38] <imsky> bakers: ye ye
[16:59:51] <Spadeski>  coldhead its kewl
[17:00:02] <imsky> coldhead can't read you

[17:00:21] <abjorn> coldhead cant read
[17:00:24] <imsky> shorthand: dSWTTTTTMWYDODODRCDWYWGGMAS();
[17:00:39] <bakers> omg
[17:00:39] <imsky> MINIFIED SIZE: 0.1K
[17:00:39] <abjorn> yeah but it's more semantic to use the full version, imsky
[17:00:42] <Spadeski> Why not ?
[17:00:50] <imsky> Spadeski: he's not here
[17:00:54] <imsky> he's probably eating doritos
[17:01:05] <abjorn> eating doritos and learning jquery cause its his first day
[17:01:16] <velts_> if i have a div with a bunch of children nodes and i have to clone that with the children nodes is that possible
[17:01:22] <imsky> i wanna get down at the first niiiiight
[17:01:27] <Spadeski> ahhh
[17:01:30] <velts_> right now in IE .clone() is not copying any children
[17:01:43] <abjorn> assuming it's not some broken html5 element, yes velts
[17:02:08] <Spadeski> imsky Wana take a look at this wierd bug i get when i hover an itme and show another item after the hover
[17:02:23] <abjorn> ben alman wants to
[17:02:30] <imsky> i should make a move but i wooon't
[17:02:36] <abjorn> imsky stop ghosting omggggg
[17:02:39] <imsky> i know you probably think that something is wrooong
[17:02:42] <imsky> abjorn: tell that to comcast
[17:02:43] <abjorn> i do
[17:02:45] <abjorn> lol
[17:02:52] <imsky> here's my network status: ping google.com /t
[17:03:02] <imsky> whenever REQUEST TIMED OUT, i take a shot
[17:03:12] <abjorn> LOL
[17:03:15] <velts_> how...right now i have the following http://pastebin.com/QnGpKdDA
[17:03:17] <abjorn> take a shot for every failed ping
[17:03:19] <imsky> srsly
[17:03:21] <velts_> and its not working in IE
[17:03:53] <abjorn> ?clone
[17:03:53] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[17:04:17] <imsky> WITH EVENTS DAMMIT
[17:04:18] <abjorn> ^ I did this to get a quick link to the docs, dont mind me
[17:04:23] <imsky> WITH EVENTS
[17:04:27] <imsky> pootis pootis
[17:04:28] <abjorn> I refuse
[17:04:34] <abjorn> fuck events
[17:04:37] <abjorn> events are so passe
[17:04:40] <imsky> lol
[17:04:45] <imsky> how do i cloned events
[17:04:57] <abjorn> also, using the squigly over the w in passe is passe
[17:05:01] <abjorn> *e
[17:05:02] <imsky> future archeologists will think we were really deep
[17:05:08] <imsky> "they talked about _cloning events_"
[17:05:11] <imsky> "did they have time travel?"
[17:05:11] <abjorn> I am so fucking deep
[17:05:24] <abjorn> jQuery: The Philosophers Library
[17:05:32] <imsky> jQuery: a good way to make pesos
[17:05:37] <abjorn> philosoQuery
[17:05:52] <imsky> abjorn: have you seen the webgl photoshop?
[17:05:59] <abjorn> no
[17:06:01] <imsky> http://evanw.github.com/webgl-filter/
[17:06:16] <abjorn> still looking at your code btw velts_
[17:06:33] <abjorn> badass imsky
[17:06:45] <imsky> try the swirl filter
[17:06:59] <abjorn> velts_: what is $player.clone().length ?
[17:07:05] <imsky> photoshop has had the same swirl filter for like 13 years :(
[17:07:31] <abjorn> lol
[17:07:34] <abjorn> it has
[17:07:42] <abjorn> why fix what is already perfected for all time
[17:07:49] <imsky> look at the swirl filter there
[17:07:53] <imsky> you can move the swirly
[17:07:54] <velts_> 1
[17:08:46] <abjorn> velts_: So it's cloning something at least
[17:09:00] <abjorn> and $player.clone().children().length ?
[17:10:28] <abjorn> holy crap the Edge Work filter on this lags like shit, imsky
[17:10:36] <imsky> get a new gpu
[17:10:45] <abjorn> ...I have a 560 GTX TI
[17:10:54] <imsky> time to SLI
[17:11:06] <abjorn> I can play every game ever at the highest settings with at least 30 fps...
[17:11:09] <imsky> edge filters are sooper hardcoar
[17:11:16] <abjorn> apparently
[17:11:20] <abjorn> at least when done in jaboscripts
[17:11:35] <abjorn> and with webgl's naive port of opengl
[17:11:51] <imsky> opengl es 2.0 you philistine
[17:12:25] <abjorn> Saying OpenGL is not inaccurate, just not specific.
[17:12:29] <imsky> which edge filter are you talking about
[17:12:29] <abjorn> homo
[17:12:31] <imsky> edge work?
[17:12:33] <abjorn> yeah
[17:13:45] <imsky> i think it's broken
[17:14:04] <velts_> 4
[17:14:47] <velts_> but in IE its 0
[17:14:49] <velts_> wtf
[17:14:55] <imsky> welcome to web development
[17:15:29] <imsky> to laymen, it appears that we work with highly abstract software to create interactive applications
[17:15:43] <abjorn> yeah thats IE for you
[17:15:51] <abjorn> what are the elements, velts_
[17:15:56] <abjorn> gimme a snippet
[17:15:58] <imsky> but to those in the know, the bulk of web development work consists in getting shit faced because of IE's inherent failure
[17:16:00] <abjorn> of the html
[17:16:10] <abjorn> imsky is 100% factual
[17:16:32] <imsky> a pint of vodka a day, that's what dr. imsky recommends
[17:16:36] <abjorn> It's almost annoying to complain about IE now because it's done every minute of every day
[17:16:46] <abjorn> So I try not to even complain anymore lest I hate myself
[17:16:48] <imsky> you forget, there are new people entering the field all the time
[17:16:57] <imsky> to them, ie's brokenness is just a meme, not a reality
[17:17:03] <abjorn> lol true
[17:17:23] <imsky> i should make a move but i woooon't
[17:17:41] <imsky> i know you probably think that something is wroooong
[17:17:45] <imsky> doo do doo
[17:18:18] <imsky> abjorn: you should reset the passwords of your problem customers to "test" some time
[17:18:36] <imsky> when they call you, be like "have you tried "test"?"
[17:18:45] <abjorn> lol
[17:18:46] <abjorn> yeah cant do that
[17:19:01] <abjorn> we reset it to a random password
[17:19:02] <Kre10s_> hmm... I have a div with overflow:scroll; I need to find all the children that are visible. can i do this?
[17:19:14] <imsky> abjorn: just fiddle with the cpu so the random gen always returns "test"
[17:19:19] <abjorn> lol
[17:19:26] <imsky> Kre10s_: you want...uhhhh..this new thing that just came out
[17:19:31] <abjorn> I can't do that brah
[17:20:50] <Kre10s_> irm wah?
[17:21:11] <imsky> Kre10s_: http://larsjung.de/fracs/
[17:21:16] <abjorn> was that even english?
[17:21:20] <imsky> that'll be $10 plz, paypal in PM
[17:22:14] <abjorn> ooo thats neato
[17:24:04] <imsky> abjorn: i forget, do you go to school?
[17:24:24] <abjorn> not right now
[17:24:33] <abjorn> got tired of it, takin a break
[17:24:53] <imsky> gotcha, good times
[17:26:55] <imsky> giving firefox the chrome theme automatically makes it feel more lightweight
[17:27:12] <imsky> just a brotip
[17:30:04] <abjorn> i like how we got firefox 6 on our computers at work the day that firefox 7 comes out
[17:30:39] <imsky> oh goddammit
[17:30:46] <imsky> i just opened mine up to see what version it was
[17:30:50] <imsky> DOWNLOADING UPDATE 1.9MB
[17:31:00] <abjorn> lol
[17:34:05] <imsky> 7.0.1, where are my future sunglasses
[17:39:59] <domino14> hey guys, i have code that looks like:    var sd = $('<select id="dropdown" name="services"></select>');
[17:40:16] <domino14> is sd a selector, or will it actually create that dom element?
[17:40:21] <domino14> if it doesnt exist
[17:40:27] <[M]ax> hum ...
[17:40:29] <[M]ax> nop
[17:40:47] <[M]ax> var sd = $('#dropdown')
[17:41:41] <domino14> yeah i like that, but 'dropdown' doesnt seem to exist in the DOM before this is called
[17:42:39] <domino14> then the code does stuff like sd.append($('<option value="0">something</option>'))
[17:43:34] <domino14> and then sd itself gets appended to a DOM element so we see a dropdown. ive just never seen the element be created like that inside a selector $()
[17:56:20] <ch3mical> Is it possible to prototype a jQuery plugin? heh
[17:56:49] <ch3mical> I'm probably overthinking this
[17:56:55] <ajpiano> nope, you have to build it so that it's ready for mass consumption and production immediately
[17:56:57] <ajpiano> no prototyping allowed

[17:57:23] <ch3mical> So is it possible to extend a plugin?
[17:59:26] <pachet> yes
[18:01:46] <ch3mical> So basically if I extend a plugin it would allow me to set default values (by settings the values of existing properties) using $.extend() ?
[18:02:00] <aple> Anyone know of a jQuery plugin for scrolling content within a div? So it looks static but moves down with the page.
[18:02:10] <aple> Usually used in a table of contents or something
[18:02:17] <ch3mical> aple: do you mean position:fixed?
[18:03:10] <ch3mical> Or you mean when it gets a negative position value it changes to position:fixed;left/top:0 ?
[18:04:53] <aple> Something like this one: http://kitchen.net-perspective.com/sf-example-1.html
[18:04:59] <aple> But what's everyone's favorite?
[18:05:08] <aple> I've seen really good looking ones but can't find them.
[18:30:15] <aple> How do I remove all whitespace from a value?
[18:30:27] <aple> $.trim just trims off ends
[18:33:09] <snover> ?jsisjs @ aple
[18:33:09] <bot-t1> aple, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[18:45:08] <miketaylr> ?isjsjs @ miketaylr
[18:45:09] <bot-t1> miketaylr, Couldn't find "isjsjs" in jQuery Docs.

[18:49:54] <bekabug> How do I get .text to stop eating my line breaks?

[18:56:05] <fructose> Any ideas on how to reload the current page after changing (or, if empty, setting) a get parameter?
[19:00:27] <CalvadoS> is there a way that i can toggle a div class to hover state on jquery onClick event ?
[19:01:18] <atula> CalvadoS: could you rephrase that? when you click on something you want it to have a hover look?
[19:01:23] <atula> I'm a bit confused.
[19:03:40] <CalvadoS> atula, ok let me try to give an example
[19:04:55] <CalvadoS> i am using gmap and making polgyram overlays on it, gmap has events like onMouseOver etc . and i got a text menu at left. Text menu has default css variables like a:hover etc, what i want is when someone mouse over map overlay that gmap event handler catches and i want to make a link to change a:hover state (css)
[19:12:34] <atula> CalvadoS: oooh... you could bind a hover event on the same area
[19:13:18] <atula> CalvadoS: .hover(function () { //over: change css} ,function () { //out: reset css });
[19:13:31] <atula> if I understand what you're trying to do correctly
[19:21:14] <bencc> how can I get the select tab in jqueryui tabs?
[19:23:20] <pachet> $('.ui-tabs-selected')
[19:24:14] <bencc> pachet: thanks
[19:24:27] <bencc> pachet: I think there should be helper function for this
[19:42:25] <domino14> i have a dropdown.change(function (e) {. .. } )
[19:42:35] <domino14> inside the event handler there's this
[19:42:39] <domino14> does 'this' refer to dropdown?
[19:47:16] <_Brun0_> domino14, AFAIK it should, show us the code.
[19:47:53] <bencc> domino14: maybe you need to use $.proxy(function(){}, this) if this is wrong
[19:51:19] <Heshanh> when i click on a link how can i select the first parent div that has the class name 'date_single'?
[19:54:38] <pachet> $(this).closest('.date-single')
[19:55:52] <paul_irish> sup jquery
[20:06:48] <atula> paul_irish: supsup
[20:14:09] <Heshanh> so quite.....
[20:18:03] <atula> Heshanh: quite quiet indeed ^^
[20:22:59] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/LRnVj60B how could I do this samething but using jquery?  I believe it is in mootools
[20:32:20] <danzik17> anyone know if there's going to be any youtube vids or anything of the jquery conf that's going on?
[20:59:54] <danstever> Hi everyone - I know there is a simple answer to this - but need some direction - I am trying to execute a function when a user hovers over a different element than the target.
[21:03:05] <cpgo> how can I add html next to a tag, not inside of it <div><p>1<p><p>2<p></div> I have <p>1<p> as the selector and I want to add content in between that and <p>2<p>
[21:04:29] <CantUnplug> cpgo: http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[21:04:43] <cpgo> sweet
[21:04:45] <cpgo> thanks
[21:05:48] <CantUnplug> danstever - you mean fire event when someone hovers every element on page but the target?
[21:06:10] <CantUnplug> bind to all?
[21:06:15] <danstever> CantUnplug: no
[21:07:10] <Spadeski> sup people
[21:07:17] <danstever> CantUnplug: I have a span that i want, when someone hovers over it, to change one other specific element.
[21:08:05] <danstever> CantUnplug: i'm wanting to make a button (the target element) appear as if someone were hovering over it by hovering over a different element.
[21:10:53] <Spadeski> 	parent.animate({'backgroundColor':'#fb6c6c'},300).animate({ opacity: 0.35 }, "slow");;
[21:13:45] <danstever> Spadeski: was that an answer for me? Sorry - lost it in this mass exodus of people.
[21:14:33] <Spadeski> yeah im still figuring how to exactly do what you want
[21:16:56] <danstever> Spadeski: I have a button that is behind a transparent image, so I can't actually 'rollover' the button - So, I put an empty span over the image where the button is - inside a link - expanded the span with padding. Now - I want the button to change state when the span is hovered.
[21:17:37] <Spadeski> umm i think i got you waitup
[21:18:31] <danstever> Spadeski: i'm getting something up on JSfiddle right now too...
[21:18:48] <Spadeski> here i got it
[21:20:12] <Spadeski> 		$(".file_download").hover(
[21:20:12] <Spadeski> 				function() {
[21:20:14] <Spadeski> 					$("#pagination li:first").css({'display' : 'block'});
[21:20:16] <Spadeski>              });
[21:20:45] <danstever> Spadeski: JSfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/aPGRx/
[21:21:36] <Spadeski> danstever I cant goto websites atm not my computer it has vision and has blocked web browser access
[21:24:57] <danstever> Spandeski: well shoot... I follow your code, but I don't think it really addresses what I need, hover it is the concept i'm trying to go for
[21:25:37] <danstever> Spandeski: ok - how about this. instead of where you have ".css" and on, I want to run a function here.
[21:26:07] <FNTom> Can anybody recommend a plugin for LocalStorage?
[21:34:47] <IndustrySlave> I have a question about saving and entire JSON string to a file. I currently have this code http://pastebin.com/qmygZcSn but I am just starting out with JSON and not sure how it is passed as a POST variable and how to access it properly. Anyone have any experience with this?
[21:36:53] <coldhead> IndustrySlave: $.post('someurl', {ur_string: var_with_json_string});
[21:36:59] <coldhead> that should be all you need on the client side
[21:37:16] <coldhead> what happens on the serverside will depend on your setup
[21:37:29] <coldhead> but you should be able to access it as a string there somehow to
[21:37:55] <coldhead> the dataType: 'json', in your code is unnecessary
[21:38:01] <IndustrySlave> yeah ... I think the client side is doing okay. I put it in $.ajax so I could get more error info out of it.  I think my real problem is on the PHP side and how to get the whole post value without a key/index
[21:38:08] <coldhead> that refers to the datatype you're getting back from the server
[21:38:17] <coldhead> the fact you're sending json doesn't matter
[21:38:25] <IndustrySlave> oh... okay .. thanks!
[21:38:29] <IndustrySlave> removed
[21:38:29] <coldhead> it's just a string
[21:38:47] <IndustrySlave> but is it a named string?
[21:39:10] <coldhead> it will be a post variable called "data"
[21:39:11] <IndustrySlave> Like if I wanted to access a post value from a form I could do that easily ... ajax is a bit trickier for me at the mooment
[21:39:18] <coldhead> so it'll be $_POST["data"] in PHP
[21:39:50] <IndustrySlave> okay ... awesome. That is what I need to know. NOw I can work my way back from that
[21:39:53] <IndustrySlave> thank you
[21:40:00] <coldhead> no problem!
[21:40:17] <coldhead> IndustrySlave: don't forget to use the network tab in firebug or web inspector
[21:40:25] <coldhead> you can see exactly what is being sent and received
[21:40:56] <IndustrySlave> I am getting an undefined index error in the php file
[21:41:35] <coldhead> IndustrySlave: i shudder to give you PHP advice in #jQuery but try print_r($_POST);
[21:41:46] <coldhead> and see what keys have what values
[21:41:57] <IndustrySlave> heh .. I am in #php as well .. but I think they are having a flame war :)
[21:42:06] <coldhead> oh how unusual
[21:42:17] <coldhead> that place is a ghetto
[21:42:43] <coldhead> are you trying to access something IN the json you sent back?
[21:42:59] <coldhead> you need to use json_decode($_POST['data'])) probably
[21:43:06] <coldhead> to turn it back into an object
[21:43:19] <Mafiay2k> hi
[21:43:31] <IndustrySlave> I am actually just trying to save the entire string to a file
[21:43:31] <Mafiay2k> morning
[21:43:39] <IndustrySlave> I use it for highcharts data
[21:43:54] <IndustrySlave> and I am buiding a quick frontend to update the chart data
[21:44:20] <coldhead> oh then ignore me
[21:44:34] <coldhead> it should just be $_POST['data']
[21:44:47] <coldhead> and print_r will help you figure out wtf if it's not in 'data'
[21:45:00] <IndustrySlave> k
[21:49:09] <Mafiay2k> hi... need some help on ui.selector
[21:49:43] <coldhead> can you be more specific, Mafiay2k ?
[21:49:50] <coldhead> maybe paste your code at jsfiddle?
[21:49:58] <coldhead> ?p @ Mafiay2k
[21:49:58] <bot-t> Mafiay2k, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:50:05] <Mafiay2k> http://todolimpieza.yxconproyectos.com/ <-- the select transformed by jquery ui.selector
[21:50:25] <Mafiay2k> does not allows me to use the scrollbars on that selects , is like there is something over it
[21:50:39] <coldhead> INTERESTING
[21:51:05] <Spadeski> anyone hey coldhead
[21:51:21] <Mafiay2k> it is veryweird
[21:51:54] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: i don't think it is something over it
[21:52:22] <coldhead> it has a lot of event handlers bound to it, to close the list again
[21:52:32] <coldhead> and clicking the scrollbar must be triggering one of those events
[21:52:56] <Mafiay2k> is there any solution?
[21:53:35] <Spadeski> hello
[21:53:49] <coldhead> it is probably something you can disable with the settings, Mafiay2k
[21:53:53] <coldhead> hello Spadeski
[21:54:20] <Spadeski> got pagination now was hard as hell to make
[21:54:46] <Mafiay2k> coldhead : mmm I am not good at .js :( you mean something here is causing it http://todolimpieza.yxconproyectos.com/js/site.js
[21:55:05] <coldhead> i'm sorry Spadeski
[21:55:09] <coldhead> you're brave to even try
[21:55:40] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: yes, you probably need something like $('thingy'),selectmenu({some:settings, go:here})
[21:55:42] <Spadeski> nah was totally worth it but now two of my animations are making the page go out of sync
[21:55:48] <coldhead> i am trying to find the docs
[21:56:57] <coldhead> sorry Mafiay2k, i don't know this library at all
[21:58:51] <Spadeski> coldhead is a onhover event supposed too change width settings of anything?
[22:00:00] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: comment out line 155 of selectmenu.js
[22:00:01] <Mafiay2k> coldhead ok... I am reading it and there is not quite info :/ http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[22:00:22] <coldhead> make it // self.close(event);
[22:00:25] <coldhead> that should fix it
[22:00:34] <Mafiay2k> selectmenu or site.js
[22:00:35] <Mafiay2k> ?
[22:01:03] <Mafiay2k> aps ok
[22:01:03] <coldhead> selectmenu
[22:01:09] <Mafiay2k> the ui.selectmenu.js ;)
[22:01:20] <coldhead> maybe that won't fix it >: |
[22:01:53] <coldhead> Spadeski: it certainly shouldn't by itself, but there may be something in the CSS that is linked to :hover
[22:02:11] <Mafiay2k> hehe it worked ;)
[22:02:25] <coldhead> i am a genius
[22:02:31] <Mafiay2k> but
[22:02:31] <Mafiay2k> :)
[22:02:36] <Mafiay2k> there is only a small bug now
[22:02:44] <Mafiay2k> cant close the open list :)
[22:02:45] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: if you want to be a good citizen you should write a comment on that page explaining the problem and how you fixed it
[22:02:51] <coldhead> so it is easier for someone else

[22:03:07] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: is your fix live?
[22:03:11] <Mafiay2k> yes
[22:03:14] <Mafiay2k> just //
[22:03:27] <coldhead> yes
[22:03:47] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: i don't see a simple way to fix this
[22:04:13] <coldhead> you will have to add some more code there that only sometimes runs that self close line
[22:04:17] <coldhead> when you want it to run
[22:04:47] <coldhead> that's a matter for yourself :D
[22:05:13] <coldhead> breakit: this is a jQuery channel, not a google support channel
[22:05:22] <coldhead> they should be paying someone to help you with that :)
[22:05:57] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: let's just say it works perfectly now and get on with our lives
[22:05:59] <coldhead> okay?
[22:06:00] <coldhead> okay

[22:06:02] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:06:14] <Mafiay2k> hehe ;) thanks coldhead anywhere, I will try to find it out. By the way, is there any solution also for that disturbing borders above and below <OPTION> things ?
[22:06:41] <Mafiay2k> on scroll all the select colors seems disturbing
[22:06:59] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: probably something to do with the CSS
[22:07:10] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: if you're not in a terrible rush, ask ajpiano when he's around
[22:07:23] <coldhead> he's the official "fix everything in jQuery UI for you" guy

[22:17:17] <coldhead> gimme a few minutes, Spadeski
[22:17:23] <coldhead> pushing some stuff live
[22:17:32] <Spadeski> kk
[22:19:22] <coldhead> what ya got, Spadeski
[22:19:52] <Spadeski> coldhead on the right where the three music blocks are shown
[22:19:53] <Spadeski> http://209.172.30.93/WWWRoot/?gp=home
[22:20:15] <Spadeski> you hover and padding and margin rules dont apply checked css got nothin
[22:22:26] <coldhead> i'm not seeing it, Spadeski
[22:22:51] <Spadeski> Where it says Drake?
[22:23:05] <coldhead> the boxes with the music notes? that one and the other ones in that column don't change when i hover
[22:24:36] <Spadeski> hmm
[22:25:10] <coldhead> i'm in chrome on linux
[22:25:16] <coldhead> so perhaps i am a weirdo
[22:25:21] <Spadeski> oh idk if it will work for chrome
[22:25:32] <coldhead> lemme try fx
[22:25:48] <Spadeski> yeah works in that
[22:29:29] <coldhead> okay
[22:29:42] <coldhead> what i think you're seeing there is that jQuery sets display:block
[22:29:45] <coldhead> to animate things
[22:29:53] <coldhead> and that is probably messing with your layout
[22:30:01] <coldhead> try setting it to display:block in the first place
[22:30:08] <coldhead> and style it like that
[22:30:15] <coldhead> then all should be well
[22:30:27] <coldhead> and if that's not it, i'm sorry, it's my first day using jQuery
[22:30:45] <Spadeski> hmm
[22:31:31] <DJ_UNA> im trying to make a banner change using jQuery.cycle here: http://b1.specific.dk - but im having a problem with the z-Index, can i change it while the banner changes?
[22:31:32] <Spadeski> i set it to display:none and im fading in
[22:31:56] <coldhead> it's something to do with the display, i'm pretty sure
[22:34:07] <Spadeski> nah dont think so
[22:34:42] <IndustrySlave> coldhead: Thanks for your help this evening. The errors all came from escape characters being generated in the JSON. Fixed and working now!
[22:35:00] <coldhead> good work, IndustrySlave
[22:35:03] <coldhead> onward and upward
[22:35:13] <coldhead> Spadeski: that's all i got, i'm sorry
[22:35:17] <coldhead> first day etc
[22:35:26] <Spadeski> nah its kewl lol
[22:35:51] <IndustrySlave> Absolutely! Have a good night!
[22:39:46] <Spadeski> coldhead I got it just showed the items :D
[22:41:08] <coldhead> \o/
[23:12:59] <irees> Hi. I have something like this: <div><input type="checkbox"></div> with $('div').click(function(){blah}); which toggles the checkbox based on a click anywhere in the div. Works great, except if I actually click the checkbox, which seems to trigger both the bound click handler and the checkbox click native handler, so two toggles = no change in state. event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() don't seem to do the trick...
[23:14:19] <irees> maybe if I disable the checkbox's click handler
[23:14:43] <paul_irish> no
[23:14:55] <irees> that worked, but seems inelegant
[23:15:08] <paul_irish> irees: inside the click handler. check $(event.target).is('input:checkbox')
[23:15:21] <irees> ok
[23:17:00] <irees> thx, that worked fine
[23:17:49] <irees> i skip setting the checkbox state if the event is the checkbox. Otherwise the rest of the click handler runs (it does other things as well)
[23:18:39] <irees> (said that backwardsâ€¦ the rest of the handler runs in both cases, just skips setting the checkbox state)
[23:21:20] <paul_irish> baller
[23:23:05] <sasori> hi, is it valid to put php stuff in a variable inside an external jquery file ? like e.g var stuff = "<?php echo $_SESSION['hello']; ?>"     ?
[23:25:09] <irees> use json
[23:25:30] <irees> otherwise you run the risk of evil things happening
