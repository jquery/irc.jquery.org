[00:02:24] <GoSox> i'm on vacation, so for the past two weeks, all web dev i've done has been tested on one browser, safari 5 for mac
[00:02:48] <GoSox> i can't wait to get home and run this all through the 25 browser gauntlet and see what really works
[00:03:38] <K3|Chris> well if it works in safari it should work fine in other stuff, as long as you're not one of them idiots that think -webkit- is all you need
[00:03:54] <K3|Chris> though safari does render fonts wrong, can cause layout issues
[00:06:03] <GoSox> i haven't yet decided how much IE support this website is going to have
[00:06:09] <GoSox> ill have to see how it performs
[00:06:30] <tw2113> IE8+
[00:06:33] <GoSox> but i think my layout is going to be total fail in everything below IE9, since I use :nth-child() to map out my layout....
[00:06:34] <tw2113> screw the rest
[00:06:39] <GoSox> just realized i'm not in #css :O
[00:06:52] <tw2113> ?selectivizr
[00:06:53] <bot-t> tw2113, Tutorials:PNG Opacity Fix for IE6 - How to make transparent PNGs possible in Internet Explorer 6 http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:PNG_Opacity_Fix_for_IE6
[00:07:03] <GoSox> on whatsmyip.org, i block IE6 and IE7, i may also block IE8 on *this* website
[00:07:06] <tw2113> how do you make the bot google something?
[00:07:12] <elfrancesco_> could someone explain me the difference beetween sibling (~) and next (+) selectors please ? i am a bit confused with their respective meanings...
[00:07:51] <tw2113> GoSox http://selectivizr.com/
[00:08:22] <GoSox> oh sure, if i'm welling to spend the time, i could probably make everything work in IE too
[00:08:23] <GoSox> but i'm not
[00:08:34] <K3|Chris> GoSox: also jQ can do :nth-child in browsers that don't support it it seems
[00:10:16] <GoSox> deep down, i really just want to block IE6-8 and not waste a minute of my time recoding existing stuff for them
[00:10:31] <K3|Chris> ditto
[00:10:48] <GoSox> 6+7 are definitely out, 8 accounts for 16.6% of my total traffic. That is a little high.
[00:11:03] <K3|Chris> should just send you to a page saying "if you're on vista/7 get IE9, if not, get firefox/chrome you caveman"
[00:11:07] <mindis|wurk> add a nag message for IE users
[00:11:23] <mindis|wurk> something that flies around the screen and keeps playing annoying sounds
[00:11:42] <GoSox> a nag message isn't enough, my website in IE8 is going to (probably) look like it will in IE6, which is, not even like a website
[00:12:05] <GoSox> on my other site, i send 6 + 7 users here: http://www.whatsmyip.org/browser-upgrade/
[00:12:29] <tw2113> i say read what selectivizr does and see how much it ends up fixing automatically
[00:13:12] <GoSox> i may look into it, 6+7 = 5%, that is negligible. But 8 = ~17%, that's kind of high.
[00:26:33] <waako> hello
[00:26:52] <waako> any chance of help with this: Given ul with nested ul and title div for each li, how do you pass value of nested li item to the div within the same container li?
[00:27:15] <Columcille> Why would I be able to .hide() an element but not .hide(500) it? I can .fadeIn() but not .fadeOut(). Quite puzzled.
[00:27:53] <tw2113> wouldn't .hide().fadeOut(500) work?
[00:28:21] <Columcille> can't get element to fadeOut at all
[00:28:39] <Columcille> First wrote it as .fadeOut(500); thought nothing of it. Was surprised when it didn't work
[00:28:50] <Columcille> then tried .hide() and it worked, so I know the selector is fine
[00:29:04] <Columcille> just when I try to fade it, either with fadeOut or hide with a duration, that it won't work
[00:29:18] <Columcille> and again, it fades in fine
[00:29:51] <Columcille> writing a simple slider, nothing complicated
[00:32:30] <K3|Chris> Columcille: tired animating opacity?
[00:32:59] <Columcille> not directly, I'll give it a try, though that's essentially what fade should do for me...
[00:33:02] <K3|Chris> btw define "won't work" also a fiddle would be nice
[00:33:05] <K3|Chris> yeah it should
[00:33:22] <Columcille> heh "won't work" as in "element remains visible"
[00:33:26] <K3|Chris> kk
[00:37:28] <waako> for http://pastie.org/3425673 how do I print, in the div.header, the title value of last li.nested.one
[00:37:34] <waako> I can't work it out :(
[00:37:39] <waako> please?
[00:41:50] <D4> Is scrollTo() a plugin or is it usable within jQ by default?
[00:42:16] <nathanb> why wouldn't my click handerly work in ie7 when its working fine in ff :(
[00:42:33] <Hooloovoo> D4: i think it's a plugin. scrollTop() is built in
[00:42:45] <nathanb> J('.delete_product').click(function () { alert('test'); });
[00:42:48] <nathanb> thats all it is :/
[00:43:12] <waako> ah well nevermind

[00:59:45] <gajanan> i want create a dashboard like this https://www.gosquared.com/demo
[00:59:58] <gajanan> how can i start doing this
[01:01:07] <john-dev> by using jquery (sortable for example)
[01:01:14] <tw2113> my word
[01:01:24] <gajanan> jonh-dev: ya
[01:01:26] <john-dev> you need ajax, css of course and stuff like that
[01:01:35] <gajanan> ya
[01:01:50] <gajanan> so how can i start this pls help out of this
[01:01:59] <john-dev> by leaving this channel..
[01:02:02] <aaronmcadam> haaha
[01:02:05] <john-dev> start with <html>
[01:02:11] <aaronmcadam> then <head>
[01:02:17] <john-dev> maybe <body>
[01:02:23] <avizion> Ctrl-U in some browsers...
[01:02:29] <john-dev> we forgot the title NOOO
[01:02:35] <aaronmcadam> yeahhhh
[01:02:49] <aaronmcadam> oh noes, meta viewport!
[01:02:57] <aaronmcadam> Mobile First! ;)
[01:03:14] <john-dev> you can add the meta viewport later.. who cares about ipads :P
[01:03:28] <aaronmcadam> more like mobiles
[01:03:32] <tw2113> i should consider something besides google analytics
[01:03:38] <john-dev> ipads for example, sry
[01:03:49] <aaronmcadam> it's growing
[01:03:51] <john-dev> tw2113, why? it's great :-/
[01:04:07] <aaronmcadam> it's nice when a site has a tablet-suitable layout
[01:04:21] <tw2113> a case of them not wanting to know TOO much
[01:04:24] <aaronmcadam> tw2113: you willing to pay?
[01:04:33] <john-dev> they will find out anyway..
[01:04:40] <aaronmcadam> why don't u just give them a hit counter?
[01:04:42] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[01:04:45] <tw2113> the pay part is what holds me back
[01:04:51] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:04:57] <tw2113> at least at the moment
[01:04:59] <aaronmcadam> that's always the way
[01:04:59] <tw2113> maybe in the future
[01:05:24] <tw2113> how the heck did it turn into 3am?
[01:05:27] <aaronmcadam> hummingbird is cool
[01:06:54] <aaronmcadam> What's that new analytics app called
[01:06:59] <aaronmcadam> with the sexy design
[01:07:03] <aaronmcadam> all green n shit
[01:07:07] <tw2113> dunno
[01:07:13] <aaronmcadam> think github own it
[01:08:08] <gajanan> john-dev: ?
[01:08:26] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ gajanan
[01:08:28] <bot-t> gajanan, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[01:08:45] <tw2113> hmm hummingbird, if i have the right one, looks to be hosted on github
[01:09:39] <aaronmcadam> it's a node app
[01:09:53] * tw2113 got Node installed a couple days ago
[01:10:04] <aaronmcadam> really? like 2 years late?
[01:10:06] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:10:10] <tw2113> mostly for local LESS work
[01:10:17] <aaronmcadam> cool
[01:10:21] <tw2113> yup, i'm a late comer
[01:10:35] <aaronmcadam> I haven't really tired less, I like sass
[01:10:39] <aaronmcadam> tried*
[01:11:04] <tw2113> i figure, at least for my own stuff that I'm not putting inside of WordPress, develop locally and with LESS, push the end result files to the server
[01:11:19] <aaronmcadam> yea
[01:11:33] <aaronmcadam> neverrrr use the js parser on your actual siteeee
[01:11:36] <tw2113> and i don't know of any hosting companies that provide Node by default
[01:11:54] <aaronmcadam> joyent
[01:12:08] <tw2113> i'd be really surprised if Dreamhost did
[01:12:10] <aaronmcadam> https://no.de/
[01:12:40] <aaronmcadam> what?
[01:12:46] <aaronmcadam> any VPS will do
[01:13:00] <tw2113> then that'd be my next step, get off of shared :P
[01:13:04] <aaronmcadam> just install it your self
[01:13:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah of course you can't have node on shared
[01:13:22] <aaronmcadam> with the other companies

[01:20:19] <Silencer> Hello, I'm trying to replace some text within a tag with a image - E.g. < a href="mysite.com"> ENG Hello world</a> - I want "ENG" to be replaced with a image - Can someone point me in the right direction?
[01:20:49] <Silencer> I tried a:contains, yet that didn't work well :) - Tried replace too
[01:21:12] <Cork> elm.html(elm.html().replace('ENG', '<img src="url">'))
[01:21:50] <Cork> Silencer: css selectors can't replace text in the page
[01:21:57] <Cork> only content of nodes
[01:22:53] <redheadphones> can i use jquery/jqueryui stuff in an open source project under the bsd 3 clause license?
[01:23:33] <Silencer> Hmm.. right, so I'd need to manipulate the a tag html right?
[01:23:47] <elfrancesco_> i have troubles using nth-child selector  http://jsfiddle.net/S4EfJ/6/ if someone can help...
[01:24:18] <Cork> Silencer: no you need to manipulate the raw text, and reparse the html to dom elements again
[01:24:50] <Cork> Silencer: preferably reduce the amount of elements you affect, as its slow to serialize and parse the html again
[01:25:25] <Cork> redheadphones: don't think either mit or gpl fitt into bsd
[01:25:47] <Cork> the oposit direction works though
[01:26:04] <redheadphones> hrm, so the project would need to be under the mit license?
[01:26:12] <Cork> ya
[01:26:16] <Cork> mit or gpl
[01:26:28] <Cork> http://jquery.org/license/
[01:26:31] <Silencer> 1 sec, I'll try something
[01:26:59] <redheadphones> sorry, new to software licensing. and mit allows modification so long as we include the license text, right?
[01:27:14] <Silencer> Cork: http://pastebin.com/EkrWnAz0 - Would that be a solution?
[01:27:27] <Cork> redheadphones: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
[01:28:04] <Cork> Silencer: no this.html() would fail
[01:28:37] <Silencer> I can see :( - Just tried it
[01:29:07] <sweb> i need JSONP for subdomains also ?
[01:29:24] <Cork> sweb: yes
[01:29:31] <Silencer> Cork: I believe there's a html inner? Could that perhaps be used? a.html().inner ?
[01:29:36] <sweb> Cork: ty
[01:29:43] <Cork> Silencer: one min
[01:29:47] <Silencer> Sure
[01:30:37] <redheadphones> Cork, http://t.wits.sg/jquery-progress-bar/ says it uses bsd. would that work then?
[01:31:12] <Cork> Silencer: http://pastebin.com/6yugrby0
[01:32:03] <Cork> redheadphones: sure as long as you don't load the main jquery lib :)
[01:32:32] <Cork> redheadphones: joke aside, jquery's main lib is mit and gpl, so what ever license you use has to be compatible with either of them
[01:32:49] <tw2113> WTFPL
[01:33:00] <redheadphones> Cork, i see how they get around it then, thanks for the insight
[01:33:23] <Cork> redheadphones: the plugin for jquery is bsd
[01:33:42] <Cork> redheadphones: as i said its more permissive
[01:34:04] <Cork> redheadphones: the bsd license basically becomes gpl or mit when you load it along side of jquery
[01:34:19] <Cork> (tanting licenses)
[01:34:45] <redheadphones> i don't think that'd work for us then, considering we load jquery in our app we want to license
[01:35:13] <Silencer> Cork: Thanks for the script, however it seems it doesn't work? :/
[01:35:35] <Cork> Silencer: doens't work?
[01:35:59] <Cork> ?p @ Silencer
[01:35:59] <bot-t> Silencer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:36:21] <Cork> and make sure it has everything needed for the code to run

[01:44:05] <Bjornet> Hi is there a way to set a session cookie via jQuery?
[01:44:24] <Bjornet> something like $.session('key', 'value')
[01:44:43] <palanivel> @xec : thank u so much
[01:45:14] * udp thinks someone should add a strong warning to the `async` option in the docs for $.ajax and friends
[01:45:33] <Silencer> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/NWBrC/1/ - correction sorry :)
[01:45:35] <udp> as in, it is strongly recommended not to set this to false
[01:47:05] <udp> in bold, and possibly even red
[01:47:10] <sanzante> how can I distinguish between two ajax calls answers? I mean, I launch two $.ajax call that its answer is handled by the same function (say it's a image updating function, for example)... how I can know which answer corresponds with which request?
[01:48:32] <Pupeno_W> I have a method that goes through all the inputs for dates in a page and adds a date picker to them. At some point, I add more date inputs to the date. Is there a problem if I call that method, that is, calling datepicker again on an input in which I already called it?
[02:14:53] <sjobidoo> hi guys :) anyone who could point me in the right direction as to why i keep getting "null" when i try getting the height of elements with this code: http://pastebin.com/Sr1CLQFW  ? :)
[02:27:26] <Xotix> hi
[02:29:15] <Zogot> Ahoy all.  Would really like some feedback to this JS http://groenkerk.nl/js/js.js , used on http://groenkerk.nl  If there may be something wrong with me writing JS like this, and wether there could be something I could improve apon
[02:29:47] <Xotix> i'm using fancybox and need to dynamically load content into it but somehow i don't get it. i can set the content at initiialisation but afterwards i can't.
[02:29:51] <Zogot> The JS looks better here http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/qunkL/ :p
[02:31:11] <mirceas17> sjobidoo: can you show me the html structure for that?
[02:31:49] <mirceas17> i think you're not targeting the element the right way
[02:32:32] <mirceas17> use http://jsfiddle.net/ please
[02:34:02] <Ghan> mornin'
[02:34:04] <mirceas17> sjobidoo: i found the solution
[02:34:51] <mirceas17> in the alert, remove .hoyreKolonne from the selector and it will work
[02:35:17] <Ghan> Problem: i got a SOAP server on another domain and i would like to show a loading notice until a specific value is returned from the SOAP server
[02:35:21] <Ghan> any idea?
[02:39:04] <Qalqi> how to create form field whose drop down list is dependant on other form fireld
[02:39:05] <Qalqi> ?
[02:39:26] <Ghan> isset
[02:39:35] <Ghan> oh.. jquery :D
[02:39:45] <mirceas17> Qalqi: use jquery to populate the second drop-down
[02:40:30] <Xotix> if i have a textarea and a button. The button gota click and takes textarea.val() and outputs it (console.log); if i change the content in the textarea and press the button. the output should be equal to what's inside of the box. correct?
[02:40:37] <Xotix> box=textarea
[02:41:05] <mirceas17> ni
[02:41:07] <mirceas17> no
[02:41:25] <Xotix> why?
[02:41:44] <mirceas17> it's not the same as with a input type=text where the value changes as you type
[02:42:04] <Xotix> so how do i get the newest value ofa textarea?
[02:42:17] <mirceas17> it has <textarea> </textarea> tags, and the text goes between those tags
[02:42:37] <Xotix> aha
[02:42:43] <mirceas17> use .html() or .text()
[02:42:46] <mirceas17> to get the value
[02:42:56] <Xotix> html didn't work e ither and i forgot about text...
[02:44:41] <mirceas17> well, .val() should work actually
[02:44:41] <Vespakoen> Hey guys, I have a draggable that connects to multiple sortables, when i drag the draggable over 1 sortable, it adjusts it's size to it, then, when i continue to move it, to another sortable, the size doesnt adjust
[02:44:53] <mirceas17> so maybe it's a problem with other pieces of code
[02:44:57] <Vespakoen> so it only workds for the first sortable it "sees" any clues what this could be ?
[02:45:31] <Vespakoen> ze code: http://pastie.org/3426169
[02:48:12] <Xotix> mirceas17: I'm weird. http://jsfiddle.net/6PE5p/
[02:50:59] <toxz> has anyone experience with proxy problem with json ajax requests?
[02:51:18] <toxz> some proxies do not allow json requests
[02:52:43] <mirceas17> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/6PE5p/1/ , as you'll see, only the .val works with the current value
[02:54:49] <Xotix> mircease probably codemirror, a plugin, create the strange behavior I'm experiencing. If i have 2 files, each go a document.ready. in the first one i define a var, how can i access it on the second one?
[02:56:08] <Vespakoen> A fiddle =) http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/15/ so i can drag the texteditor / facebook / shario onto a region, it adjusts its size, wich is nice, but when i move on to the other region, it doesnt adjust? any clues ?
[02:59:20] <Xotix> How can i make something like this working? http://jsfiddle.net/6PE5p/2/
[03:00:21] <mirceas17> Xotix: my first guess is you can't, only if you define the var before you execute the document.ready
[03:01:15] <mirceas17> you can't use variables from a function in another function
[03:01:30] <anoc> could somebody test that does http://www.louhi.fi/ work or do i have problem with my carrier Dns ??
[03:02:05] <Xotix> mirceas17: hmm, thinking of a function's scope, it make sense.
[03:02:21] <mindis|wurk> anoc yep, works
[03:02:56] <Vespakoen> louhi.fi doesnt work for me
[03:03:03] <Vespakoen> (netherlands)
[03:05:53] <Vespakoen> http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/17/
[03:10:15] <kakeman> anoc: doesn't work in Kuopio
[03:10:59] <Xotix> how can i do something like $(this img)  whereas this is an jquery object of an element e.g. $(#foo); so i want to get all img's withing foo. like $(#foo img)
[03:11:10] <anoc> so its not just my isp.. thankyou for the info :)
[03:12:06] <anoc> $(this).find('img').each(function()  // automaattinen titletagi linkkeihin
[03:12:07] <anoc> {
[03:12:11] <anoc> lol
[03:18:58] <Dirkos_> Im work with bootstrap-collapse.js v2.0.1. But it seems there is somekind of bug and i dont know if its jquery or bootstrap
[03:19:17] <Dirkos_> due some odd reason the thing adds a height:88px to the inline style in IE when collapsing
[03:19:25] <Dirkos_> in firefox it stays on AUTO which works ofc
[03:21:29] <Ghan> How do i check this over and over again until there is a response from the URL? http://jsfiddle.net/tNAbc/
[03:21:53] <Ghan> now it's getting no response
[03:22:01] <Ghan> so it shows the loading
[03:22:22] <Ghan> but if the url php script get's a result
[03:22:24] <Ghan> it should
[03:26:00] <Xotix> how can i check if someone has set a with with css?
[03:26:17] <mirceas17> Ghan: to me it shows Dat ging perfect!
[03:26:21] <mirceas17> so it's getting a response
[03:26:47] <Ghan> yeah cause i changed the php document
[03:26:54] <Ghan> but this script only runs once
[03:27:04] <Ghan> a i need it to run every couple of seconds
[03:27:18] <Ghan> to look for changes in the SOAP message
[03:27:24] <Ghan> that's the job of the PHP
[03:27:46] <mirceas17> use setInterval
[03:27:51] <Ghan> cause it's cross domain
[03:28:11] <Bid>  hi, anyone have example for how facebook do the "more feeds" when scrolling down?
[03:28:16] <Ghan> and i can't make a SOAP call cross domain with javascript
[03:28:26] <K3|Chris> Bid: it's called ajax
[03:28:40] <Bid> yes, what triger the event
[03:29:09] <K3|Chris> most likely scrolling, comparing the scroll position with the height of the page or something
[03:29:34] <Ghan> or does someone have a solution on how to check a SOAP XML for changes without reloading the page?
[03:29:39] <mirceas17> Bid: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=load+content+while+scrolling+with+jquery
[03:29:51] <Bid> thanks
[03:30:15] <Bid> nice
[03:31:16] <mirceas17> Ghan: won't calling it with ajax every 5 seconds or so work?
[03:32:03] <Ghan> and how would i do that?
[03:32:09] <Ghan> i'm more a PHP man
[03:32:11] <Ghan> .....
[03:32:33] <K3|Chris> ...
[03:34:11] <mirceas17> hmm...maybe like this, store the current value returned with ajax in a var, and check it against the new data retrieved, using .ajaxComplete and .setInterval
[03:34:31] <mirceas17> cause you said you were checking for changes
[03:34:36] <Ghan> yeah
[03:34:50] <Ghan> from NoFile to something else
[03:36:57] <Dreamstiffler> i know this is not #html but here
[03:37:02] <Dreamstiffler> ...can anyone view this : http://jsfiddle.net/UMjHD/ and please explain where does b2 and c went to?
[03:37:37] <Dreamstiffler> and what does == Cannot send to channel: #html means?
[03:38:16] <mirceas17> Dreamstiffler: close the iframe tag
[03:38:26] <Dreamstiffler> crap hold on
[03:38:41] <mirceas17> not with /> but with </iframe>
[03:38:53] <Dreamstiffler> ok hold up
[03:41:14] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:41:24] <jomofcw> How can I return the outerHtml of an element ?
[03:41:34] <jomofcw> without calling its parent.
[03:45:47] <mirceas17> jomofcw: that doesn't make sense...what are you trying to do?
[03:45:53] <Dreamstiffler> my actual code has </iframe>
[03:46:05] <Dreamstiffler> but some how it has that affect where it hides those 2
[03:46:14] <Dreamstiffler> what cold be possible
[03:47:21] <mirceas17> check if all your divs are closed or if you have extra </div>
[03:49:51] <jomofcw> mirceas17 I'm trying to get the HTML value of an element that isn't attach to DOM.
[03:51:48] <jomofcw> mirceas17 other case : trying to get the outerHTMl of an element that has siblings. So I can't call parent().html() because it will return me the HTML of my element and its siblings.
[03:54:08] <mindis|wurk> you could clone the parent, remove the elements you don't want and then get the html
[03:54:38] <Aamir> its working but just wondering if there is a better way to check if the image i am trying to display does exists http://gyazo.com/49cab01be11f47fabdf9ed80c0a3674d.png?1329825149
[03:55:09] <mirceas17> jomofcw: well, I would store the value of the element in a variable, get all the values of the siblings and exclude by comparison
[03:56:18] <mirceas17> but mindis|wurk's solution is better
[04:01:01] <Dreamstiffler> bl try to figure it first
[04:18:45] <slartsa> has anyeone had to count the amount of dynamically created elements?
[04:19:46] <K3|Chris> slartsa: .size() ?
[04:20:14] <slartsa> how is .size relevat to amount of elements?
[04:20:19] <slartsa> relevant
[04:20:23] <K3|Chris> just read the api
[04:20:37] <K3|Chris> http://api.jquery.com/size/
[04:21:28] <m1chael> does anyone know of any scripts where i can move my mouse over a thumbnail and have a larger image pop-up as i move my mouse over the thumbs?
[04:28:06] <slartsa> K3|Chris: thanks, it really was size(), pretty confusing name I have to say :)
[04:28:23] <K3|Chris> it's the size of the selector
[04:28:39] <K3|Chris> m1chael: only millions, but you're kinda vague
[04:29:21] <Iarfen> Hi!!!
[04:29:39] <Iarfen> the ajax methods of jquery uses the http parameter: X-Requested-With??
[04:29:41] <K3|Chris> O_o
[04:30:40] <Zogot> Should do Iarfen
[04:31:31] <Iarfen> Zogot: But everytime it do it??? I need to know if it everytime, it doesn't depend on the browser right??
[04:32:18] <liampotter> what do you mean?
[04:32:31] <Zogot> Ive just had my PHP detect for HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH and not had issues with it across browsers
[04:33:24] <Zogot> but just make a function in PHP that checks if an ajax request, so even if in the future it doesn't, or it doesn't now, its just adding to that function the other name of the header
[04:34:09] <Iarfen> ok ty
[04:38:58] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[04:39:47] <sjobidoo> not sure if this is just javascript in general or if jquery has a sollution, but is there a way to get the biggest value of an array with jquery? :)
[04:41:23] <jackp10> I have a problem that i cannot figure out how to solve.. I have a field set with autocomplete, and the date source is an external json file. I am trying to match only the beginning of the word, instead of searching across the whole word.
[04:41:28] <jackp10> here is what i have so far: http://pastebin.com/EZSeHAiA
[04:42:27] <jackp10> what am I doing wrong in there ?
[04:44:06] <jackp10> if I set the source like this â€¦. source: holidex_codes, it does work, but if I type "os" it also returns "cost"
[04:57:31] <jeffsmykil> I'm looking for an autocomplete plugin that can use json dats
[04:58:29] <jeffsmykil> oh there is one in UI
[04:58:31] <jeffsmykil> nic
[05:04:45] <sjobidoo> http://pastebin.com/EsaAvWZD   anyone know what i'm doing wrong in this little snippet? :)
[05:05:34] <sjobidoo> i'm basically trying to get the height of an element which exist inside another div and change it if needed..perhaps i'm going about it from the wrong angle :)
[05:05:56] <Cork> sjobidoo: this isn't a selector
[05:06:06] <Cork> you can concat it with a string and get a working selector
[05:06:12] <Cork> use ?.find
[05:06:12] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[05:06:30] <Cork> $(this).find('.midImg')
[05:06:44] <sjobidoo> aww..thanks. I'll have a go at it :D
[05:10:17] <sjobidoo> problem solved. Thanks alot cork :D
[05:17:51] <FinalAngel> is there somewhere a good regex tester for javascript (online and not flash ;)
[05:19:15] <aaronmcadam> FinalAngel: http://rubular.com/
[05:19:35] <aaronmcadam> don't come back and say "that's Ruby" cuz the syntax should be the same
[05:19:51] <FinalAngel> yeah yeah I know...
[05:19:58] <aaronmcadam> give it a go
[05:20:09] <aaronmcadam> sorry too used to noobs here :D
[05:20:20] <FinalAngel> hehe ;)
[05:20:35] <FinalAngel> do you have an in depth know how of regex?
[05:21:12] <aaronmcadam> a little bit
[05:21:19] <aaronmcadam> learning more
[05:21:44] <aaronmcadam> what are u trying to do
[05:22:13] <FinalAngel> I always wonder whe some people write it like that: /\.(blahblabha)?$/i whats the beginning and end for?
[05:22:20] <FinalAngel> *why
[05:22:54] <aaronmcadam> hm?
[05:22:59] <Cork> \. is searching for a dot and $ is end of string
[05:23:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah escaping the .
[05:23:22] <aaronmcadam> looking for a class or something
[05:23:30] <aaronmcadam> in a selector maybe who knows
[05:23:40] <aaronmcadam> or maybe a file ext
[05:23:46] <FinalAngel> I don't understand ?$/i
[05:23:58] <Cork> FinalAngel: its ()? not ?$
[05:24:06] <aaronmcadam> that's the group
[05:24:14] <Cork> FinalAngel: it basically mean whats in the group is optional
[05:24:48] <aaronmcadam> then the i is case insensitive?
[05:24:49] <Cork> /i means case insensetive
[05:24:54] <aaronmcadam> heh :)
[05:24:57] <Cork> :)
[05:25:09] <aaronmcadam> Thanks for jumpin in Cork
[05:25:09] <FinalAngel> ah kay :)
[05:25:15] <FinalAngel> thanks
[05:25:19] <Cork> it could have a g too and that would mean global match
[05:25:23] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:25:40] <aaronmcadam> used to it from vim
[05:26:08] <aaronmcadam> strangely enough, vim's probably helping me relearn regexes and also ruby guard files
[05:26:42] <FinalAngel> any good book recommendations about regex? (I'm only using javascript)
[05:26:48] <aaronmcadam> the o reilly one
[05:27:02] <Cork> the regex website is quite nice
[05:27:04] <aaronmcadam> regex syntax is pretty standard
[05:27:09] <aaronmcadam> so any book would do
[05:27:22] <Cork> http://www.regular-expressions.info/
[05:27:29] <FinalAngel> yeah but IE can screw up anything
[05:27:31] <aaronmcadam> there was a reg ex library site somewhere
[05:27:51] <FinalAngel> thanks
[05:29:02] <aaronmcadam> FinalAngel: http://regexlib.com
[05:29:30] <aaronmcadam> O Reilly Regular Expression Pocket Reference
[05:29:53] <FinalAngel> thanks, and ordered ;)
[05:30:35] <aaronmcadam> http://www.ultrapico.com/Expresso.htm looks ok, looks windows only tho so fail

[05:35:05] <geekbuntu> aaronmcadam, i get work done on windows, but using win7 to get to my ubuntu box ;-)
[05:35:11] <aaronmcadam> FinalAngel: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/regular-expression-tools-resources/
[05:35:24] <geekbuntu> aaronmcadam, you're looking for a regex tool?
[05:35:24] <aaronmcadam> tut tut
[05:35:25] <aaronmcadam> :D
[05:35:32] <FinalAngel> yeah looking through that atm
[05:35:34] <aaronmcadam> just browsing
[05:35:39] <geekbuntu> i just tried everything
[05:35:45] <aaronmcadam> but would like a gnome one
[05:35:50] <fof> there are some browser regexp editor add-ons also
[05:36:03] <geekbuntu> aaronmcadam, i ended up at gskinner.com
[05:36:04] <aaronmcadam> and not that fuckin awful Flex app
[05:36:07] <geekbuntu> go to blog
[05:36:11] <geekbuntu> look for regex link
[05:36:17] <geekbuntu> and he has an adobe air download
[05:36:18] <aaronmcadam> it's shit
[05:36:20] <geekbuntu> so can have local
[05:36:28] <aaronmcadam> yeh yeh Flex sucks balls
[05:36:33] <geekbuntu> i'm kinda sold on it because it's portable
[05:37:09] <geekbuntu> if you get technical - adobe sucks balls
[05:37:21] <Cork> very tecnical...
[05:37:23] <geekbuntu> even their web deployment is build like a jenga tower
[05:37:37] <aaronmcadam> But Flex *is* fucking awful
[05:37:46] <geekbuntu> luckily - never got into it
[05:37:54] <sjobidoo> i'm trying to count the number of elements which exist inside another class...but obviously doing something wrong :P   any ideas?  --> http://pastebin.com/dmQ2v3m4
[05:37:59] <aaronmcadam> I've worked on a CMS that used it
[05:38:00] <geekbuntu> coldfusion was 'memorable' tho
[05:38:08] <geekbuntu> hm, cms with flex?
[05:38:12] <geekbuntu> interesting
[05:38:13] <xec> sjobidoo: you're missing a .
[05:38:26] <xec> sjobidoo: assuming midtImg is a class
[05:38:26] <Cork> sjobidoo: midtImg would be an element
[05:38:28] <aaronmcadam> and PHP with XSLT backend
[05:38:34] <aaronmcadam> that was fuckin horrible too
[05:38:37] <Cork> sjobidoo: you forgot the dot
[05:38:41] <sjobidoo> *Cough*...haha../hide
[05:38:43] <sjobidoo> thanks :P
[05:38:52] <geekbuntu> i used a javascript cms when i worked at SU - all frontend was xslt
[05:38:59] <geekbuntu> painful
[05:40:05] <aaronmcadam> hmm this ff addon might do
[05:40:17] <geekbuntu> what did you find?
[05:40:27] <geekbuntu> aaron - aren't you in mass?
[05:40:41] <aaronmcadam> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2077

[05:41:06] <Qalqi> How to select an element from a variable whose type is html?
[05:41:14] <aaronmcadam> whaaa/
[05:41:24] <Cork> qual: $(var_name).find
[05:41:25] <geekbuntu> worked there for a while
[05:41:31] <geekbuntu> good beer place
[05:41:35] <Cork> *Qalqi:
[05:41:39] <geekbuntu> beer places hard to find
[05:41:41] <aaronmcadam> I don't live in ireland
[05:41:41] <geekbuntu> here
[05:41:52] <aaronmcadam> and I don't believe in religion
[05:42:04] <geekbuntu> o.0
[05:42:09] <geekbuntu> beer is good
[05:42:12] <geekbuntu> mantra
[05:42:13] <aaronmcadam> yes
[05:42:17] <Qalqi> oh wow
[05:42:39] <aaronmcadam> fuckin mass, what cheek
[05:42:44] <Xotix> do you know a good, basic coverflow style plugin which isnt outdated?
[05:42:50] <geekbuntu> i heard or read jquery tmpl was going away... anyone else heard that?
[05:42:59] <geekbuntu> or maybe getting absorbed into something else?
[05:43:00] <Cork> geekbuntu: yes,
[05:43:03] <aaronmcadam> uh like  a year ago
[05:43:07] <Cork> it got dropped over to jquery-ui
[05:43:11] <aaronmcadam> jq ui was taking it on
[05:43:13] <geekbuntu> i'm old - memory bad
[05:43:15] <aaronmcadam> but it's been frozen
[05:43:25] <geekbuntu> nvm - never heard taht
[05:43:28] <aaronmcadam> they're reviewing what features they actally want
[05:43:29] <geekbuntu> took a sec to process
[05:43:41] <geekbuntu> i wish they would/could keep it more string replace
[05:43:45] <Cork> ?.jqote2 is nice too
[05:43:45] <geekbuntu> drop a few features
[05:43:50] <aaronmcadam> the guy who did jq-tmpl has jsrender
[05:43:51] <bot-t> Cork, node insertion | jQuery Plugins - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/node-insertion
[05:44:01] <Cork> uh... no
[05:44:10] <geekbuntu> no jsrender?
[05:44:13] <geekbuntu> boris korloff?
[05:44:23] <aaronmcadam> can't remember his name
[05:44:24] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[05:44:25] <bot-t> Cork, jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[05:44:40] <aaronmcadam> I use underscore templates but that's cuz I use backbone
[05:44:42] <Cork> its the fastest templater around for the moment
[05:44:47] <aaronmcadam> but handlebars looks good
[05:44:57] <geekbuntu> a buddy of mine gave me a revamp of underscore templates he made
[05:45:01] <geekbuntu> for require
[05:45:17] <geekbuntu> after using jquery-tmpl so long - brain won't twist back straight
[05:45:31] <geekbuntu> i'm boris-cized
[05:45:33] <aaronmcadam> u should have dropped it ages ago
[05:45:42] <geekbuntu> luckily, have the sense to ask now
[05:45:45] <geekbuntu> will check out cork
[05:45:47] <geekbuntu> s idea
[05:45:51] <geekbuntu> (ty cork)
[05:45:57] <geekbuntu> and look at handlebars again
[05:46:10] <aaronmcadam> handlebars or mustache have more users but it can't be that different
[05:46:20] <geekbuntu> was going ot check out knockout - but heard a rumor it may be toast too
[05:46:30] <aaronmcadam> that's an mvc framework
[05:46:38] <geekbuntu> yes, but was using jquery-tmpl
[05:46:39] <aaronmcadam> only one small part would be templating
[05:46:42] <geekbuntu> true
[05:46:52] <geekbuntu> maybe should go look at their source code
[05:46:56] <aaronmcadam> dunno, as I said I'm a backbone guy
[05:46:57] <geekbuntu> see which way they went/are going
[05:47:13] <geekbuntu> requirejs is working for me so far
[05:47:19] <geekbuntu> but i do a lot of python
[05:47:20] <geekbuntu> web
[05:47:22] <aaronmcadam> you using r.js?
[05:47:27] <geekbuntu> just started using it
[05:47:29] <geekbuntu> this week
[05:47:34] <aaronmcadam> I mean the compiler

[05:47:36] <geekbuntu> yes
[05:47:39] <aaronmcadam> cool
[05:47:46] <geekbuntu> compression really makes a diff

[05:55:03] <Qalqi> http://dpaste.com/706315/
[05:55:09] <Qalqi> nyone help me with this
[05:55:24] <Qalqi> var j doesnt get added atall
[05:57:11] <Vespakoen> Anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/17/
[05:57:59] <Vespakoen> Qalqi, what do you get when you do console.log(html);
[05:58:08] <Vespakoen> or console.log($(html));
[06:00:55] <Qalqi> i get a complete html page
[06:01:22] <Vespakoen> hmz
[06:01:42] <Vespakoen> so try $('#element') in stead of $(html).find('#element')
[06:01:45] <klawd> hi! can i stop the user from leaving the site in an $('
[06:01:46] <Qalqi> but console.log(j) gives an empty array
[06:01:52] <klawd> hi! can i stop the user from leaving the site in an $('a').onclick?
[06:02:16] <klawd> i want to have him confirm the action
[06:02:34] * faithlove is away (Gone fishing!)
[06:03:12] <Xotix> when trying to use http://www.jcoverflip.com/ i get Cannot call method 'create' of undefined. Can someone give me more infos about create()?
[06:07:20] <jeffreylevesque> is $($.trim(currentGrants) + ":empty").hide(); proper syntax?
[06:07:31] <jeffreylevesque> actually $($.trim('.currentGrants') + ":empty").hide();
[06:09:04] <jomofcw> Is there a way to apply a style to an element that will be add in future ?
[06:09:21] <jomofcw> I try with a delegate event "load" but it doesn't work :/
[06:15:53] <NET||abuse> hmm, why isn't this finding errheading? http://jsfiddle.net/lukeab/fZLcK/4/
[06:16:14] <NET||abuse> and this code sucks, would rather refactor it
[06:16:33] <NET||abuse> but not sure how
[06:16:35] <aaronmcadam> jomofcw: don't forget CSS. add a class in ur stylesheet and apply it with ur js
[06:17:02] <aaronmcadam> jomofcw: and yes, u can't delegate the load event
[06:17:05] <skyer2000> i have 3 elements sprinkled around a page, is there a way to search through the entire page and select the 1st occurence, 2nd occurence, etc of those elements? (not worried about performance in this situation)
[06:17:56] <aaronmcadam> skyer2000: what happens when do u do $('.class').eq(0/1/2)
[06:18:07] <aaronmcadam> 0 = 1st, 1 = 2nd, etc
[06:18:34] <NET||abuse> skyer2000: var items = $('.class'); console.log(items);  should be an array of your elements wherever they are around the page.
[06:18:51] <aaronmcadam> ?eq @ skyer2000
[06:18:52] <bot-t> skyer2000, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:19:15] <NET||abuse> hmm, hadn't used eq() before,
[06:19:27] <aaronmcadam> it's very useful
[06:19:36] <aaronmcadam> also see ?index
[06:19:36] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[06:19:45] <skyer2000> eq is what I needed!
[06:19:53] <aaronmcadam> ha that's the wrong description
[06:19:56] <skyer2000> thank you for the heads up on that function
[06:20:00] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[06:20:10] <fof> jomofcw: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:20:19] <fof> look at direct & delegated events
[06:20:23] <aaronmcadam> try reading the API every now n then
[06:21:27] <NET||abuse> so how can i improve the the getErrorDiv method in this fiddle?
[06:21:29] <NET||abuse> http://jsfiddle.net/lukeab/fZLcK/4/
[06:21:41] <aaronmcadam> or "bound" events, to give them their proper title
[06:21:53] <NET||abuse> first of all, it's not finding the h2 like it should.
[06:22:08] <NET||abuse> second, it's kind of ugly method, if anyone had an optimisation sugggestion, i'd love it.
[06:22:48] <AdvoWork> Is there a way I can delete all table rows with a class name on the tr? so if all are <tr class="test"  can I delete all with test?
[06:22:49] <NET||abuse> the idea is to have a common method across various form doms that will have many of the element classes/types as in that getErrorDiv method.
[06:23:05] <NET||abuse> $('table tr.test').remove()
[06:23:14] <aaronmcadam> first of all
[06:23:21] <aaronmcadam> that function is too big
[06:23:33] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: ok, so abstract some parts of it out.
[06:23:38] <aaronmcadam> also repeating predicates
[06:25:02] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: how do you mean repeating predicates?
[06:25:14] <aaronmcadam> u know what logic is
[06:25:29] <aaronmcadam> the statement `a < b` is a predicate
[06:25:35] <NET||abuse> ok
[06:25:47] <aaronmcadam> if(errtrap.length==0){
[06:25:53] <NET||abuse> ok
[06:26:07] <aaronmcadam> is repeated 5 times in that function
[06:26:30] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: yes, as if one item doesn't exist, then we have to try searching for another one, if it isn't there, we search again for something different
[06:26:41] <jeffreylevesque> will this replace the current text if there is blank space: $('.currentGrants').text( $('.currentGrants').html().name.value.trim() );
[06:26:48] <aaronmcadam> oh god right
[06:26:48] <AdvoWork> NET||abuse, can you repaste the code you did for the row please?
[06:26:54] <aaronmcadam> that's really bad coding practice
[06:27:20] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: yes, it felt bad, but i'm not sure of a better pattern for achieving this case by case search.
[06:27:39] <NET||abuse> AdvoWork: $('table tr.test').remove();
[06:27:43] <aaronmcadam> yucky
[06:28:01] <NET||abuse> AdvoWork: or did you want to remove any tr that has any class at all, regardless of the class name?
[06:28:25] <AdvoWork> NET||abuse, basically, if a tr exists with that class name(which it may not all the time), remove them
[06:28:38] <Xotix> i have a plugin which throws 	.	Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'create' of undefined can someone help me on that? Maybe there have been some changes which causes create() to break?
[06:29:29] <aaronmcadam> plugin isn't being included properly
[06:29:38] <sphinxxx> i need to write a javascript function that checks whether a string is a valid URL or not
[06:29:44] <aaronmcadam> it's not create that's the problem there Xotix
[06:29:46] <NET||abuse> ok, AdvoWork if you want the tr class name to be totally variable, then $('table tr[class]').remove(); so if any class name is set it will be removed
[06:29:59] <aaronmcadam> Xotix: it's that it's not creating the plugin object
[06:30:29] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: so what were you saying there, how can i fix this yucky code?
[06:31:20] <domcat> any ideas why jQuery cycle is not working when called inside of .load() ?
[06:32:21] <AdvoWork> NET||abuse, i've got a few <tr id="new_row"> yet when I do:  alert($("table tr.new_row").length);  it says 0. And then wont remove any rows, any ideas?
[06:32:45] <NET||abuse> AdvoWork: id's are not classes
[06:33:09] <AdvoWork> doh, tr#new_row ?
[06:33:11] <warrenparsons> NET||abuse: Details...
[06:33:26] <NET||abuse> warrenparsons: oh, i posted js fiddle already, here
[06:33:34] <NET||abuse> http://jsfiddle.net/lukeab/fZLcK/4/
[06:33:54] <sjobidoo> http://pastebin.com/91y0jP5q    Any clue as to why only the first occurance of this div gets the class i wish to add?  :/
[06:33:58] <NET||abuse> warrenparsons: so basically, the h2 should be found by the getErrorDiv
[06:34:03] <warrenparsons> NET||abuse: Either you responded to the wrong person or my joke didn't fly.
[06:34:07] <NET||abuse> but it's not being found, also the code is rotten.
[06:34:26] <NET||abuse> warrenparsons: oh, sorry , got you now
[06:34:42] <Xotix> Does someone know a good coverflow plugin? or an gallery which such a feature?
[06:34:46] <NET||abuse> id's/classess, what's the difference! yeh, i get it now
[06:35:04] <NET||abuse> Xotix: google is great for that kinda thing
[06:35:37] <sveajobb> NET||abuse, but we are better
[06:36:10] <Xotix> NET||abuse:  i know...
[06:38:15] <sjobidoo> I'm trying to check every occurrance of a certain class on my page..which again contains 2 other classes..check the 2 classes' heights and compare them..if one is larger than the other...resize the smallest to the larger div's height..then go on to the next "parent" class and check it's same 2 classes etc..until no more "parent" classes.. any idea how to go about this task? :P
[06:38:52] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: so do you have any suggestion of how to reduce the repeating predicates in this case, as you can see i have to search for previous siblings, then go up a level (parent) and search for previous siblings again.
[06:39:10] <NET||abuse> then change the header class/element i'm looking for a repeat
[06:39:37] <nFFF>  errheading=elementwrapper.prev('span.address-heading');
[06:39:44] <nFFF> does this element even exist in your html? :<
[06:40:04] <NET||abuse> then search for wrappers if the headers aren't found, it's ugly, but the problem is smop'sy, and i can't think of a simpler approach
[06:40:34] <NET||abuse> nFFF: in this example no, but this code is run on several different forms, and they can have that element
[06:40:49] <NET||abuse> so this code checks for each case
[06:40:56] <nFFF> Well your if statements can't you condense them to one
[06:41:02] <nFFF> and use the || or operator
[06:41:02] <ethciF> hi guyz, i have a strange problem with the IE9: the user have to click several times until $.click event fires..   same with .blur event                 any clues?
[06:41:06] <nFFF> on the variable
[06:41:22] <warrenparsons> sjobidoo: We use this plugin pretty regularly for that kind of thing. http://www.cssnewbie.com/equalheights-jquery-plugin/
[06:41:27] <NET||abuse> ... hmm, can i assign in an iff?
[06:41:31] <NET||abuse> if
[06:41:50] <sveajobb> NET||abuse, if ( (var=something) > 0 )
[06:41:51] <nFFF> no but; var x = object || object1 || object2; it hink
[06:42:03] <nFFF> I think the above is legal
[06:42:06] <NET||abuse> hmm, that's only for undefined, not ==0
[06:42:12] <NET||abuse> i think
[06:42:14] <NET||abuse> i can try it.
[06:42:18] <sveajobb> nFFF, really? isn't my syntax above legal javascript? works in c anyways :)
[06:42:40] <nFFF> sorry wasnt replying to you sveajobb
[06:42:54] <nFFF> NET||abuse, you have identical if statements
[06:42:55] <nFFF> why?
[06:43:12] <sveajobb> nFFF, yeah but we were both trying to help NET||abuse on the question "hmm, can I assign in an if"
[06:45:36] <nFFF> Yea I've enver seen it recommended before
[06:48:56] <NET||abuse> nFFF:  sveajobb: aaronmcadam : how about this then http://jsfiddle.net/lukeab/wFd4x/5/
[06:49:02] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't be assigning anything in an if
[06:49:48] <aaronmcadam> not so sure they're going to be actually equal
[06:49:56] <NET||abuse> hahaha aaronmcadam that's just what i was wondering, and if you read up the question i'm trying to answer.
[06:50:01] <aaronmcadam> still horrible
[06:50:04] <NET||abuse> anyway
[06:50:09] <aaronmcadam> you have to compare dom nodes
[06:50:10] <NET||abuse> yes, it's not beautiful.
[06:50:34] <aaronmcadam> very far from it :D
[06:50:55] <NET||abuse> so.. how do you mean compare them, i don't do any comparisons, i only check if length is 0 or not
[06:51:07] <aaronmcadam> u can compare dom nodes i just said
[06:51:14] <aaronmcadam> use [0] to get the dom node
[06:51:23] <NET||abuse> but i don't need to compare dom node?
[06:51:27] <aaronmcadam> out of a jquery set
[06:51:39] <NET||abuse> in which bit, i don't see what you mean,
[06:51:56] <aaronmcadam> ok
[06:52:44] <aaronmcadam> can someone else jump in here i'm having lunch
[06:55:59] <NET||abuse> hmm, ok, i'm getting an empty set array for errtrap, but the if statement is returning true, so assignment is happening on searching through the $element.parents(something) list
[06:56:11] <NET||abuse> but not in the case of the elementwrapper.prev(something) list
[06:56:36] <nFFF> Im not going to lie, I don't even know what you are trying to do
[06:56:57] <nFFF> Just a custom form validation?
[06:57:25] <NET||abuse> nFFF, this code will be called from validation methods of forms throughout a site, and search for the appropriate point to insert the error list
[06:57:31] <aaronmcadam> he's making life very difficult for himself that's for sure
[06:58:20] <nFFF> NET||abuse but half your code doesn't even apply to the HTML so its hard ot follow
[06:59:45] <NET||abuse> there are forms with different structures in the site, some examples <form><div class="form-wrapper"><h2>   or <form>stuff and element <span class="address-header"><div class="form-wrapper"><div class="element-wrapper"><input>
[07:00:15] <aaronmcadam> do u have control over the html
[07:00:23] <NET||abuse> so the code has to search upward through the dom tree of the form to a certain degree to find the appropriate points to insert the errors
[07:00:28] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: yes
[07:00:37] <aaronmcadam> then standardise
[07:00:40] <nFFF> lol :>>
[07:00:42] <aaronmcadam> stop coding for a minute
[07:00:47] <aaronmcadam> and think about what ur doin
[07:00:48] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: but it would take longer to do that as there are dozens of forms
[07:01:00] <nFFF> Have a standard form markup?
[07:01:03] <nFFF> Like most sites would
[07:01:03] <NET||abuse> i didn't do the origional work
[07:01:17] <who_are_you> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[07:01:19] <nFFF> Ok, so where do you want to insert the errors?
[07:01:26] <who_are_you> the "distance" argument, how do I pass it here? I must be missing something
[07:01:31] <aaronmcadam> it's taken u longer to do it with js than just changing the html
[07:01:33] <NET||abuse> there are just various edge cases that were coded for in zend that produces regular markup in each of the edge cases.
[07:01:34] <nFFF> Just find the <form> element and insert there
[07:01:57] <aaronmcadam> I'm willing to bet that even u trying to explain that mess of code has taken longer
[07:02:00] <nFFF> really you should just insert before the label
[07:02:07] <domcat> any ideas why jQuery cycle is not working when called inside of .load() ?
[07:02:16] <NET||abuse> nFFF: no i can't, the forms are too big, with 20 errors in a list at the top relevant to form elements 2 page lengths down the page.
[07:02:19] <aaronmcadam> or usr jQuery Validate for god's sake
[07:02:37] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: i am using jquery validate
[07:02:47] <NET||abuse> this is a method called to position the error messages jquery validate emits
[07:02:51] <nFFF> NET||abuse, just add a class to the labels, like 'error' and then in css: .errory { background-color:red; color;white:}
[07:03:03] <NET||abuse> nFFF: i do that too
[07:03:12] <NET||abuse> the form elements get a border-color set to red
[07:03:26] <nFFF> Im confuzzled :|
[07:03:28] <NET||abuse> =but then we need specific errors grouped under their form subsection headers
[07:03:42] <nFFF> And what is the form subsections
[07:03:44] <aaronmcadam> god
[07:03:45] <nFFF> h2 elements?
[07:04:15] <NET||abuse> nFFF: well yeh, someone thought it would be a good idea to put h2's in some cases, span class="address-header" in other cases
[07:04:31] <NET||abuse> this is a year of work done by an external contractor who was, frankly, terrible
[07:04:40] <aaronmcadam> basically invest your time in changing the html
[07:04:51] <nFFF> NET||abuse, and this sub header is always within a <form>
[07:04:51] <nFFF> ?
[07:04:53] <aaronmcadam> instead of trying to hack something that probably won't cover all ur edge cases
[07:04:57] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: well i would if i were let, but my boss says no, do it this way now
[07:05:10] <aaronmcadam> u need to tell ur boss no
[07:05:12] <NET||abuse> nFFF: yeh, at least that much is consistent
[07:05:13] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:05:25] <nFFF> $('form h2')
[07:05:29] <nFFF> Why not just use this?
[07:05:51] <NET||abuse> as there are 4 or 5 h2's or <span class="address-header"   elements through out the forms, they are big big forms
[07:05:55] <NET||abuse> with many subsections.
[07:06:02] <nFFF> var x = $('form h2') || $('form .address-header"');
[07:06:11] <nFFF> x.each(function(){
[07:06:15] <aaronmcadam> "big big forms" misses the whole point of froms
[07:06:17] <aaronmcadam> forms*
[07:06:31] <aaronmcadam> your poor users :D
[07:06:45] <aaronmcadam> is this consumer facing?
[07:06:51] <nFFF> NET||abuse, do you understand what I wrote?
[07:07:07] <nFFF> Just assignt he objects to a variable and iterate through them with each()
[07:07:27] <aaronmcadam> nFFF that won't work
[07:07:32] <aaronmcadam> the way u think it will
[07:08:04] <aaronmcadam> var x = $('form h2').length ?  $('form h2') : $('form .address-header"');
[07:08:04] <domcat> any ideas why jQuery cycle is not working when called inside of .load() ?
[07:08:33] <aaronmcadam> otherwise, x will always only just hold £('form h2'
[07:08:40] <aaronmcadam> $('form h2')
[07:08:55] <aaronmcadam> domcat man that's impossible to know without seeing your code u know
[07:09:19] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/wFd4x/13/
[07:09:38] <nFFF> aaronmcadam even if form h2 doesn;t exist?
[07:09:43] <domcat> aaronmcadam:  here is the code http://pastie.org/3427500
[07:09:57] <nFFF> Perhaps, but the idea is there :D
[07:10:27] <domcat> aaroncadam, now I was experimenting with .live(), but it not helped too..
[07:10:56] <aaronmcadam> look
[07:11:03] <aaronmcadam> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/wFd4x/14/
[07:11:11] <aaronmcadam> always returns true
[07:11:35] <aaronmcadam> check your logic before you tell people what to do ;)
[07:12:05] <aaronmcadam> nFFF remember, jQuery selections fail silently
[07:12:16] <aaronmcadam> they always return true
[07:12:22] <johnkpaul> aaronmcadam: totally off topic, but is the pound sign the same key as the $ sign for you?
[07:12:31] <aaronmcadam> it's beside
[07:12:36] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[07:12:40] <johnkpaul> also, what are you trying to do with that fiddle?
[07:12:47] <aaronmcadam> hm?
[07:13:02] <johnkpaul> are you asking why the second console.log is true
[07:13:03] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: these forms are defined by a standards body in our industry, so they have to be presentable at length, we have some options to cut them up by the subsectioning we do to have multi step forms, but what we do requires the lengthy user input isde to it.
[07:13:06] <aaronmcadam> I'm showing him that $() returns true no matter what
[07:13:08] <aaronmcadam> no
[07:13:12] <aaronmcadam> i'm telling him
[07:13:22] <nFFF> aaronmcadam, yea my bad, minor thing, my code logic in how to solve his problem is ok
[07:13:37] <aaronmcadam> not really minor, it was wrong
[07:13:55] <aaronmcadam> he would have always selected just the high level h2s within that form
[07:13:57] <JonathanCutrell> Hey folks...
[07:14:07] <NET||abuse> well, this will likely be a bit better now.. http://jsfiddle.net/lukeab/wFd4x/15/
[07:14:16] <JonathanCutrell> I'm looking for a plugin that works similarly to jquery masonry,
[07:14:20] <JonathanCutrell> except in BOTH directions.
[07:14:29] <NET||abuse> except that  elementwrapper.prev('h2')   should be hitting on the element in the markup in that fiddle, and it's not
[07:14:47] <JonathanCutrell> so in other words, no column widths.
[07:14:51] <nFFF> yea I thought it would return undefined, wierd that it doesnt
[07:15:14] <aaronmcadam> no it's not!
[07:15:18] <JonathanCutrell> Hoping to make the result look something like this: http://cl.ly/472u071i2z3y1c3x3k10
[07:15:20] <aaronmcadam> it's *very* good
[07:15:37] <aaronmcadam> otherwise you'd need to check whether els exist all the bloody time
[07:15:56] <johnkpaul> Aragon: ooh I ee, it returns an object that is not empty
[07:16:06] <johnkpaul> sorry, aaronmcadam^^
[07:16:11] <johnkpaul> it doesn't reutn true
[07:16:17] <johnkpaul> it returns something that js coerces to true
[07:16:24] <johnkpaul> $() !== true
[07:16:28] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[07:16:34] <aaronmcadam> !!x
[07:16:38] <aaronmcadam> that's what I was doing
[07:16:41] <johnkpaul> yeah, I see
[07:16:49] <johnkpaul> I always forget this, is ther a js botin here with jQUery

[07:26:05] <JonathanCutrell> aaronmcadam: ah ok.
[07:26:15] <aaronmcadam> it's really simple actually
[07:26:19] <aaronmcadam> when u break it down
[07:26:39] <aaronmcadam> just boolean and unary operator stuff
[07:27:31] <JonathanCutrell> aaronmcadam: Glad we have time to do these things.
[07:28:43] <aaronmcadam> it's very useful to know
[07:28:50] <aaronmcadam> I use the unary operator all the time
[07:28:57] <aaronmcadam> instead of using parseInt all the time
[07:30:34] <Amanda19> can sombody tell me how to use this hack?   http://www.hagenburger.net/BLOG/HTML5-Input-Placeholder-Fix-With-jQuery.html
[07:30:45] <Amanda19> should i just paste the code in my .js file?
[07:30:48] <Amanda19> is that enough?
[07:31:18] <aaronmcadam> is there no blog post with that
[07:31:21] <LukeNukem> Amanda19, yes use the code
[07:31:24] <aaronmcadam> no small tutorial?
[07:31:27] <LukeNukem> add the css too for the place horder text
[07:31:30] <LukeNukem> holder*
[07:32:09] <Amanda19> you mean this  .placeholder
[07:32:22] <LukeNukem> yep
[07:32:24] <nFFF> Lol be funny if that was ever an interview question :D
[07:32:24] <Amanda19> i pasted the first piece of code, but it does not work

[07:33:54] <LukeNukem> Amanda19, hold on, this is pretty easy..i will prepare the fiddle for you
[07:34:06] <Amanda19> no fiddle
[07:34:14] <Amanda19> can you just please the code?
[07:34:34] <LukeNukem> ok give me a minute
[07:34:38] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:34:40] <gehsekky> i often like to please my code
[07:34:43] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[07:34:45] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:34:57] <aaronmcadam> It loves it when I refactor it
[07:35:14] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: you laughing at what i needed to do to get it working?
[07:35:16] <NET||abuse> :)
[07:35:23] <aaronmcadam> hm?
[07:35:23] <aaronmcadam> no
[07:35:25] <NET||abuse> or your own code?
[07:35:26] <NET||abuse> oh, ok
[07:35:30] <aaronmcadam> I gave up lookin at ur code ages ago dude
[07:35:33] <aaronmcadam> was too upsetting
[07:35:46] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: yeh, but you know it happens, rock|me|hardplace
[07:36:11] <NET||abuse> anyway, works now
[07:36:23] <aaronmcadam> I'll take ur word for it then so
[07:38:28] <NET||abuse> aaronmcadam: :) cool, cheers for the feedback, just sounding out th eproble here in irc somtimes helps me reach my own conclusion
[07:40:00] <nFFF> NET||abuse your code is horrible :|
[07:40:11] <nFFF> You were even pretty much given the solution :\
[07:40:37] <DJTrey> can somone help with with this each() issue where i'm trying to set the values of images in another div. http://jsfiddle.net/BmTdT/1/
[07:44:51] <rahmen> Hi! JSONP requests do not call the error handler ("Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests.") Is there any way of knowing when the request fails? I've tried adding timeout but it doesn't seem to help. I would like to know if the server is down or not. So how should I do this? Thanks!
[07:45:44] <nFFF> DJTrey, whats the issue?
[07:46:26] <DJTrey> nFFF: the thumbnails should be image1, image2, image3 from the slideshow
[07:46:33] <fof> aaronmcadam: you must be a pleasure to work with :)
[07:47:03] <aaronmcadam> fof oh yeah I am :D
[07:49:27] <xckpd7> question: where is a site that will give me an outline for making a todo app?
[07:49:33] <nFFF> DJTrey, so you want to map them basically
[07:49:56] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: todomvc
[07:49:59] <xckpd7> usually to learn javascript, a site will give an outline for what you should be doing... and how to progressively improve it
[07:50:06] <DJTrey> nFFF: yes
[07:50:15] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc
[07:50:25] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: I'm looking at todomvc but that doesn't look like an outline, it's just a finished product where you can browse the source
[07:50:48] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean you want a tutorial
[07:50:51] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: it's just a way to cheat... I want an outline to be able to do it myself... I know there was a site with instructions before
[07:51:02] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: not a tutorial... like I want like
[07:51:05] <johnkpaul> hmm, I don't know one of f the top of my head
[07:51:20] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: ok first, make an input and have the ability to add todos with checkmarks... step 1
[07:51:42] <xckpd7> now add a way to delete 1 of them... now add a way to mark them as done... maybe with some hints, maybe not
[07:51:52] <johnkpaul> :) is this for you? it seems like you've already got it down
[07:52:55] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: who me? no... I'm looking at todomvc and it's tough because there is so much code for such a seemingly simple app
[07:53:06] <fof> something lile this? http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html
[07:53:08] <fof> like
[07:53:09] <xckpd7> so i figure if I try to do one myself, then that code will actually make sense

[07:56:20] <nFFF> aaronmcadam
[07:56:21] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/BmTdT/2/
[07:56:24] <DJTrey> yes
[07:56:26] <nFFF> Make this work :D
[07:56:36] <nFFF> I think you can do soething like that
[07:56:46] <DJTrey> whoaa
[07:56:59] <DJTrey> i thought mine was doing a better job
[07:57:02] <DJTrey> lol
[07:57:19] <aaronmcadam> sorry I got work to do
[07:57:22] <xckpd7> whatever... I'll try to completely do it myself and then refer to their applications for ideas
[07:57:32] <xckpd7> it'll probably work out best that way anyway
[07:57:51] <xckpd7> just going to start on a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gGVxF/
[08:01:26] <dorgan> ok i have added a click handler to a link..and I am using preventDefault()   is there a way after I am done doing what I need to do to resumeDefault??
[08:04:42] <johnkpaul> dorgan: there is nothing to do _exactly_ what you want
[08:04:47] <johnkpaul> but this post on SO might help you
[08:04:47] <johnkpaul> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1164132/how-to-reenable-event-preventdefault/1164177#1164177
[08:05:28] <dorgan> If i add a click handler to a link and dont use preventDefault() then inside the click handler i have an ajax request will the processing of the default link event wait until the ajax request is complete?
[08:05:42] <dorgan> maybe thats the better question
[08:06:38] <johnkpaul> dorgan: you can use a synchronous request, but I don't know if that's the best way to do it either
[08:06:43] <johnkpaul> is this on a link?
[08:06:46] <johnkpaul> anchor tag?
[08:06:48] <Bheam> hi
[08:06:54] <dorgan> johnkpaul: yes
[08:07:11] <johnkpaul> dorgan: then why not just use your response from the ajax call to change window.location?
[08:07:12] <nFFF> DJTrey
[08:07:12] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/BmTdT/3/
[08:07:15] <nFFF> :>>
[08:07:20] <dorgan> yeah i could do that
[08:07:22] <johnkpaul> do you really care that all of the other events are fired, or that the page changes
[08:07:29] <Bheam> i'm polling every 30ms $('#someimage').get(0).width, and sometimes randomly it returns 0, any clues?
[08:07:47] <johnkpaul> dorgan: the other option is to use the async:False option in your ajax request
[08:07:51] <Bheam> so yea while caching the width would work, i would still like to know what's going on
[08:07:53] <johnkpaul> but that will freeze the UI until the ajax call returns
[08:08:31] <dorgan> but using the response to change window.location would have the same effect
[08:08:41] <dorgan> well not really
[08:08:42] <johnkpaul> no it wouldn't
[08:08:43] <dorgan> it wouldnt freeze
[08:08:46] <johnkpaul> yeah
[08:08:50] <dorgan> sorry brain fart
[08:09:08] <johnkpaul> :) it happens

[08:21:14] <johnkpaul> hold on, will find the docs
[08:21:28] <johnkpaul> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.getComputedStyle
[08:21:38] <johnkpaul> I don't beliee you can _modify_ them
[08:21:40] <johnkpaul> but you can query for them
[08:21:59] <johnkpaul> so you can call window.getComputedStyle(myElement,"after")
[08:22:12] <johnkpaul> and you will be returned an object that is of type CSSStyleDeclaration
[08:22:23] <johnkpaul> which has AFAIK only one useful method called getPropertyValue()
[08:22:31] <johnkpaul> which you can pass "content" to
[08:22:51] <NodeX> they are readonly proeprties
[08:22:55] <NodeX> properties*
[08:22:59] <johnkpaul> yeah, I thought so
[08:23:06] <NodeX> hence the "get" part!!
[08:23:11] <johnkpaul> I actually wrote a blog post about a IE shim a few weeks ago http://johnkpaul.tumblr.com/post/17380987688/shim-for-javascript
[08:23:40] <johnkpaul> If you want to modify it to work with pseudoelements, that'd be great :D
[08:23:49] <aaronmcadam> this is a question for #jquery-dev really
[08:24:05] <aaronmcadam> be nice to see the roadmap around this
[08:27:44] <klotski> hi guys, is it possible to have an accordion menu but with only one section being expanded and the other main list items just work as normal links?
[08:27:53] <dorgan> does .post()   encode values?
[08:30:37] <johnkpaul> dorgan: yes, the normal www/form-encoded-ly
[08:30:46] <johnkpaul> .get() url encodes them IIRC
[08:33:52] <xckpd7> ajpiano: thanks
[08:34:07] <xckpd7> sorry, was working on getting that working
[08:34:37] <xckpd7> I was overthinking it... I just put the wrapping directly in the selector: http://jsfiddle.net/gGVxF/9/
[08:35:46] <ajpiano> great
[08:38:11] <Vespakoen> WANTED: jQuery hero! http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/19/
[08:39:20] <jedimind> are people still trying to build their own WYSIWYG cms's ?
[08:39:21] <jedimind> damn
[08:39:45] <NodeX> why wouldnt they ?
[08:39:48] <Vespakoen> =D
[08:39:53] <Vespakoen> http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/20/ (cleaned up version)
[08:39:54] <NodeX> what's on offer is a load of toilet currently
[08:40:05] <Vespakoen> right you are!
[08:40:12] <Vespakoen> my cms will be simple and powerfull =D
[08:40:18] <Vespakoen> hopefully
[08:40:40] <NodeX> mine is lol
[08:41:17] <NodeX> Vespakoen : you will have to resize on the fly
[08:41:23] <Gnagno> hello all
[08:41:23] <kkuno> hi
[08:41:28] <Vespakoen> yeh but.. i thought jquery would do that for me (A)
[08:41:31] <Vespakoen> it does, initially
[08:41:32] <NodeX> and if you want yours to be powerful stay away from bloated javascript!
[08:41:45] <Vespakoen> yah this is all the JS i will do
[08:41:53] <Vespakoen> and i will let other refactor it later =P
[08:42:06] <NodeX> i.e don't use jquery UI unless you intend to use it all else it's an overkill just for drag/drop/sort
[08:42:08] <kkuno> I'm using ajax to load content.. the problem is that I cannot use hashtag to jump through the page
[08:42:09] <Vespakoen> i just need to get the base right? / working
[08:42:32] <kkuno> what can I do?
[08:42:36] <Gnagno> I have an image positioned over another bigger image, I'd like to capture the click on the image behind and do something, and on the image on the front and do something else, but when I click on the image on the front both actions get triggered...
[08:43:04] <kkuno> do I have to use js instead of the classic browser function?
[08:43:05] <Vespakoen> kkuno there is http://www.google.nl/#sclient=psy-ab&hl=nl&site=&source=hp&q=browser+history+plugin&pbx=1&oq=browser+history+plugin&aq=f&aqi=g-vL1&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=638l3509l0l3621l22l16l0l5l5l0l141l1297l11.4l20l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=fcaf413c3007f9ec&biw=1680&bih=942
[08:43:07] <Vespakoen> oops
[08:43:13] <Bauer> guys, I have a problem with this piece of code: http://pastebin.com/T6j17Ub3 when I aadd it to the source of the page, the page is not rendered at all, when I add the code via Console in Chrome or Firebug, it works... :S
[08:43:16] <Vespakoen> https://github.com/balupton/jquery-history
[08:43:25] <Vespakoen> that mabye ?
[08:43:44] <johnkpaul> Gnagno: can we have a jsfiddle example?
[08:43:55] <kkuno> Vespakoen, yeah I know that I can use pushstate and javascript
[08:44:09] <johnkpaul> Bauer: that code should be inside document ready
[08:44:13] <kkuno> but I wonder if I can still use the old hashtag jump function of browsers
[08:44:24] <Gnagno> johnkpaul, I will try to make an example
[08:44:31] <NodeX> History.js reverts and degrades
[08:44:35] <Bauer> johnkpaul: ohhh, riiiight! lol thanks.. been a long time I didnt use jquery
[08:44:45] <NodeX> it uses history.pushStae() if it's there else it uses hash tags
[08:44:54] <nFFF> Gnagno, bind the blick to the bigger image and check the target
[08:44:57] <DJTrey> nFFF: sorry had my window closed
[08:45:05] <xckpd7> I know I just started this, but any early critiques? making a todo app
[08:45:08] <xckpd7> http://jsfiddle.net/gGVxF/11/
[08:45:10] <kkuno> mmh
[08:45:13] <nFFF> DJTrey did you get the fiddle?
[08:45:26] <Gnagno> nFFF, sorry, I didn't get you... what do you mean exactly?
[08:45:27] <Vespakoen> gtg
[08:46:17] <nFFF> $('.biggerimage').click(function(e) { console.log(e.target); });
[08:49:06] <Bauer> johnkpaul: it still is not working: http://pastebin.com/i1EqjLTi
[08:49:13] <Bauer> what else could be causing it?
[08:50:00] <johnkpaul> Bauer: can you put the example into jsfiddle? that code seems fine
[08:51:15] <Gnagno> nFFF, as target I get the smaller image in overlay.... not the biggerimage!
[08:51:26] <andrew91831> is there something like autoviewer but free, preferably done in jquery ?
[08:52:20] <Bauer> johnkpaul: How? the page where I am trying to add it is internal, and pretty complex with lot of other scripts loaded etc
[08:52:25] <Bauer> :(
[08:52:41] <nFFF> Gnagno
[08:52:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/DkL77/
[08:52:47] <nFFF> Like this is what I meant
[08:53:27] <johnkpaul> try to remove as much code as possible to still maintain the issue, find a minimal test case
[08:54:25] <DJTrey> nFFF: yes, after I fixed mine. i believe you overcomplicated it =)
[08:54:34] <DJTrey> just one line would have been fine
[08:54:37] <DJTrey> $('#slideshow .pagers a img').eq($('.slides a img').index(this)).attr('src', src);
[08:55:29] <Gnagno> nFFF, I did it like that... I get as output in console the smaller icon
[08:55:56] <nFFF> DJTrey, one line?
[08:56:01] <nFFF> You mean one line in an each?
[08:56:18] <DJTrey> i mean, i only changed one line
[08:56:24] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/BmTdT/1/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/BmTdT/3/
[08:56:31] <Gnagno> this is my fiddle, can someone please help me? http://jsfiddle.net/6UkLg/
[08:57:28] <nFFF> Pretty much as complicated as each other :P
[08:57:37] <DJTrey> lol
[08:57:41] <DJTrey> yeah maybe so
[08:58:18] <nFFF> curious to know which would be faster
[08:58:22] <nFFF> doa jsperf :D
[08:58:31] <Eviltwin> Gnagno: http://jsfiddle.net/6UkLg/3/
[08:58:33] <nFFF> Gnagno, thats nothing like what I did
[08:58:34] <alexr2> Gnagno add a return false at the end of the click function
[08:58:52] <nFFF> Eviltwin wizardy
[08:59:10] <Gnagno> Eviltwin, I love you! :)
[08:59:11] <johnkpaul> Gnagno: both are being called, but the event is bubbling up and the thumbnail container handler is called last
[08:59:37] <johnkpaul> don't return false, event.stopPropagation()
[08:59:42] <Gnagno> I didn't know about stopPropagation
[08:59:52] <NodeX> it's the best thing ever!
[09:00:00] <Eviltwin> ?event.stopPropagation @ Gnagno
[09:00:00] <bot-t> Gnagno, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[09:00:35] <johnkpaul> returning false calls both stopPropagation _and_ preventDefault
[09:08:40] <_dave_h_d> hi anyone knows how to remove this: data-role="page" div created by jquery mobile
[09:09:51] <johnkpaul> _dave_h_d: jquery mobile doesn't add that to any document AFAIK
[09:10:05] <johnkpaul> you add that to your html to let jquery mobile know what you sondier a page
[09:10:13] <Zzaichik> Gnagno: it's working as it should, actually.
[09:10:32] <_dave_h_d> johnkpaul: what is sounder?
[09:10:48] <_dave_h_d> sounder rather?
[09:10:53] <johnkpaul> ha, sorry, somehow that was supposed to be consider
[09:11:13] <_dave_h_d> johnkpaul: i did not add this to my page
[09:11:31] <_dave_h_d> it only started occurring since i included j query mobile
[09:33:24] <thomedy> quick question my ajax call is saying it cant find its url i gave it... but i dont know why because i have the php file it just prints yes right now but it cant even find the file
[09:33:34] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/27UCJ/3/
[09:33:49] <Eviltwin> Do you know what same origin policy is?
[09:34:06] <jedimind> or cross domain policies
[09:34:21] <thomedy> are yo uasking me...
[09:34:25] <jedimind> yes
[09:34:32] <thomedy> oh your talking about the google url
[09:34:36] <thomedy> yeah i do i just dont know
[09:34:39] <thomedy> the key in it
[09:34:45] <thomedy> my url in the file
[09:34:57] <thomedy> is in my domain
[09:35:00] <thomedy> sorry i forgot about that
[09:35:03] <xckpd7> any critiques on my Todo App? http://jsfiddle.net/gGVxF/18/
[09:35:06] <thomedy> one sec let me give you the actually file
[09:35:26] <xckpd7> it's still rough but I'm excited with the progress
[09:35:46] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: it looks pretty good
[09:35:47] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/27UCJ/4/
[09:35:54] <johnkpaul> my only immeidate reaction is that I expect the enter key to ork
[09:35:56] <johnkpaul> work*
[09:35:57] <thomedy> sorry bout that
[09:35:58] <sphinxxx> thomedy: most likely your path to the file is off by a directory, or something like that
[09:36:08] <thomedy> so everything else looks fine
[09:36:18] <thomedy> granted i dont have success: right now
[09:36:26] <thomedy> but i stopped short of that because its not finding the url
[09:36:49] <sphinxxx> thomedy:  is this javascript running in your main html file, or is it in its own javascript file somewhere
[09:37:03] <elb0w> Is there a way to do something like. $('div').attr('id','someid').each(obj,function(i,k){ $(this).append('<span>' + k + '</span>'); } ).appendTo('#something');
[09:37:06] <elb0w> would that work?
[09:37:11] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: ok I'm working on that now, also trying to get the input to clear once a todo is added
[09:37:29] <thomedy> seperate js file
[09:37:36] <thomedy> but in the same directory
[09:37:46] <thomedy> oh wait that makes sense because its deep in the directory of my tree
[09:37:51] <thomedy> okay that might bfix it
[09:37:52] <thomedy> one sec
[09:37:53] <thomedy> thank you
[09:38:08] <Seubeu> Hi all, I need some information about send form values containing FILE. How do you send information through Ajax for a form element of type='file' ??? because $('element').serialize() just doesn't work :p
[09:38:11] <thomedy> so its being called at root index but my php file is way down there
[09:38:15] <thomedy> that totaly makes sense
[09:38:20] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: another comment would be that I'd expect that if this was supposed to be a widget that I can include elsewhere, that I could pass a selector into App.init that would scope all of those lookups to a partulacr part of my dom
[09:38:33] <johnkpaul> I don't know what your goal is with this though, as jsut a learning exercise, it's really good
[09:39:40] <yannickoo> hey guys can anybode tell me why i don't get the "foo" every time i call http://fiddle.jshell.net/spxAN/show/light/#foo ?
[09:39:57] <yannickoo> the fiddle url is http://jsfiddle.net/spxAN
[09:40:28] <yannickoo> i think the dom is not ready when i check the location hash and the dom
[09:40:36] <thomedy> yep that fixred it
[09:40:42] <thomedy> thanks i totally wasn't paying attention
[09:41:03] <sphinxxx> np
[09:41:09] <sphinxxx> its easy to overlook
[09:41:17] <thomedy> okay so quick question about security... cuz to be honest im not so pro yet.. im teaching myself and i havent been doing it taht long
[09:41:34] <thomedy> first context
[09:41:58] <thomedy> im taking the html() out of <option> and using some regex to search alphabetically
[09:42:02] <thomedy> theres no input other than taht
[09:42:08] <thomedy> im using that to query the db
[09:42:15] <thomedy> i should be fine security wise
[09:42:16] <thomedy> correct?
[09:42:17] <johnkpaul> yannickoo: hash is empty string
[09:42:20] <johnkpaul> which is coereced to false
[09:42:28] <johnkpaul> so your alert never runs
[09:43:07] <kara_sweets> hey guys, can anyone help identify whats wrong with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/W24WT/
[09:43:07] <sphinxxx> thomedy:  you should always have some code that runs client side (javascript) to prevent unnecessary calls to the server,  but the server should be able to handle incorrect strings without crashing
[09:43:25] <sphinxxx> meaning you should write code on both ends for validation
[09:43:39] <thomedy> oh thank you for clarifying
[09:43:45] <thomedy> so some error correction and validation
[09:43:54] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: just as a learning exercise.... I don't know the exact tangible benefits of organizing my code with something like Backbone... and usually stuff I've done on the web has never been application level like a Todo App
[09:43:57] <thomedy> im coming to web from c++ and java so the concepts are not entirely foreign to me
[09:43:59] <thomedy> thank you
[09:44:02] <johnkpaul> kara_sweets: div.innerHTML isn't a function
[09:44:06] <thomedy> by the way i love web...
[09:44:07] <johnkpaul> it's a property that you set
[09:44:16] <thomedy> art/math/code/
[09:44:19] <thomedy> sweet!
[09:44:25] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: so I figure for experience and to really understand the benefits of backbone and other stuff that organizes my code, I have to try to code it vanilla first, and then I could vividly see the benfits
[09:44:36] <johnkpaul> ah I see, that's a good way to learn
[09:44:38] <kara_sweets> so do i just remove the portion that opens a closes a new function?
[09:44:42] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to save image using jquery?
[09:44:51] <Tomashe> i mean save new image
[09:44:55] <NodeX> save image to what ?
[09:44:59] <Tomashe> a combination betwen 2 images
[09:45:24] <Jon47> whoa weirdâ€¦ Date constructor takes a year, month, and day, and *only* the month field is zero-indexed
[09:45:26] <Jon47> that's hella confusing
[09:45:36] <Tomashe> lets say i have square and i'm placing 2 images inside using jquery there is a way to save them in current positions?
[09:46:09] <kara_sweets> johnkpaul, do you have any suggestions on how to fix it?
[09:46:17] <NodeX> you can save the positions but not the resulting image
[09:46:25] <Tomashe> i c
[09:46:41] <Tomashe> so i will have to do this in php then using the images positions i guess
[09:46:46] <NodeX> correct
[09:47:03] <johnkpaul> kara_sweets: set div.innerHTML as you would set a variable
[09:47:10] <johnkpaul> div.innerHTML = "your text here"
[09:47:32] <johnkpaul> first, are you checking your error console/firebug kara_sweets?
[09:48:07] <kara_sweets> ahh no I'm not, didnt know you could do that
[09:49:12] <johnkpaul> yeah, you can
[09:49:16] <johnkpaul> that's where I saw that error
[09:49:44] <kara_sweets> cool thanks for pointing that out
[09:49:51] <darcyclarke> does anyone know when browsers will support jquery natively?
[09:50:09] <kara_sweets> i changed the variable the way you said, i still cant figure out how to get it to set to the div on click
[09:50:44] <snover> darcyclarke: opera already does
[09:51:14] <darcyclarke> snover wicked.. so my jquereez will just work right?
[09:51:31] <snover> yep! no need for scripts, just jump right in
[09:51:56] <Bauer> johnkpaul: I found out that if I put the jquery script (which shows blank like I told you before), in a seperate .js file instead of the HTML file, it works ok - why could that be?
[09:51:57] <z0n3d> anyone worked with google maps api before? how would i store the result of polygon.getPaths() in a database TEXT column?
[09:52:14] <z0n3d> so that i can retrieve it later and call polygon.setPaths
[09:52:29] <johnkpaul> kara_sweets: preventDefault in your click handler, because you are submitting the form every time it's clicked
[09:52:41] <johnkpaul> Bauer: that's very hard to diagnose without more information, it could be a millon reaons
[09:53:38] <Bauer> johnkpaul: well, tomorrow we'll move it to production, so maybe then you could help look what causes this :)
[09:54:10] <johnkpaul> :)
[09:56:57] <deeathstar> Can I use jquery on an ajax response?
[09:57:43] <xckpd7> ok I added in enter key support, and the input clears / focuses now: http://jsfiddle.net/gGVxF/22/
[09:57:59] <xckpd7> the code is starting to get very tangled though
[09:58:41] <deeathstar> I am essentially trying for jQuery.ajax(success: function(result) { jQuery(result, "#DivToSelect").html(); });
[10:01:09] <sphinxxx> deeathstar:  of course
[10:01:25] <sphinxxx> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:01:58] <Trisox> how do you guys mock/stub json?
[10:02:28] <Zzaichik> like this "neener neener". Okay bad joke.
[10:09:51] <itsgreen> JqueryUI: can I attach (through a secondary script) a function on sortable's stop
[10:10:20] <itsgreen> script 1 has the sortable script I don't want to edit this script
[10:10:45] <itsgreen> script2.js needs to run a function when that sortable is stopped
[10:10:50] <itsgreen> is that possible?
[10:11:27] <ajpiano> itsgreen: $("#whatever").bind("sortstop", fn), i believe
[10:12:11] <ptrin> hey all. I need to do several animations one after another (with different elements) and currently I'm using nested callbacks but it's starting to feel a little dirty... What's the best way to accomplish this without 8 levels of indentation?
[10:13:35] <ryanneufeld> I have a non-jquery question here but I know some experts hang out here. http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Y8ZNU/
[10:14:06] <ryanneufeld> given that, a) how could it be improved, and b) how could I make that into an extension of the Array Prototype
[10:16:44] <nick_h> hey guys. why does this not list div#foo ?:  $('<div id="foo"> <div id="bar"> text </div> </div>').find('div')
[10:17:18] <ryanneufeld> nick_h: it's gonna take the first div as the parent
[10:17:25] <ryanneufeld> and search its children
[10:19:29] <nick_h> ryanneufeld: that seems odd to me. why wouldn't it search everything?
[10:20:59] <ryanneufeld> nick_h: what you've asked it to do is the same as this: $('div#foo').find('div');
[10:22:59] <ShaunR> with the jquery ui is there anyway to do icons with simple a href links?
[10:23:13] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: you don't need jqueryui for that
[10:23:19] <ryanneufeld> you can do it with just cdss
[10:24:28] <nick_h> ryanneufeld: hm. so .find() will look inside of all top-level elements? for example, this lists div#bar and div#bbq : $('<div id="foo"> <div id="bar" /> </div>  <div id="baz"> <div id="bbq" /> </div>').find('div')
[10:24:38] <ShaunR> ryanneufeld: jqueryui already there and it's icons are available so why not..
[10:25:01] <ajpiano> ShaunR: just put a <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-whatever"> inside your anchor
[10:26:35] <LukeNukem> anybody here with chrome?
[10:26:38] <LukeNukem> browser
[10:28:52] <nick_h> LukeNukem: what question do you really want to ask?
[10:29:00] <LukeNukem> nevermind forget it
[10:29:12] <LukeNukem> just that a piece of jquery code wasn't working in chrome
[10:33:44] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: how's it going?
[10:34:34] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: reasonable!
[10:34:35] <ajpiano> busy busy
[10:34:39] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I hear yea
[10:34:55] <itsgreen> Is it possible to do execute a certain function if the class is changed of an item , something like $('.someclass').classesarechanged(function({}))
[10:35:22] <itsgreen> ie. when someone removes, adds, toggles a class
[10:35:37] <Eviltwin> itsgreen: No, that's called a DOM mutation
[10:35:48] <Eviltwin> And we know now it's a bad idea to have events for those
[10:35:56] <Eviltwin> Because event handlers are likely to make DOM mutations
[10:36:03] <Eviltwin> Which would in turn trigger more events
[10:36:09] <itsgreen> infinite loops and such ;)
[10:36:19] <Eviltwin> You can use cumton events if you want
[10:36:37] <ravenzz> you can extend the addClass, removeClass, toggleClass function maybe
[10:36:50] <Eviltwin> Do $(".myelements").bind("classchanged", function(e) { ... }) and whenever you do .addClass, .removeClass, or .toggleClass, you do .trigger("classchanged");
[10:37:41] <itsgreen> hmmm
[10:38:26] <cyberrog> I'm trying to make a simple POST request (not to retrieve json, just send data), to a url like: http://url.com but I have the error Origin http://localhost:8000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Any Idea?
[10:38:54] <Eviltwin> It's a violation of Same Origin Policy
[10:39:10] <cyberrog> Eviltwin what do u mean?
[10:39:44] <Eviltwin> ?g Same Origin Policy @ cyberrog
[10:39:45] <bot-t> cyberrog, Same origin policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[10:39:47] <Eviltwin> Read that page
[10:39:57] <cyberrog> ok
[10:40:13] <LucaS05> hi
[10:41:16] <cyberrog> Eviltwin so.. how can I solve this??
[10:41:28] <Eviltwin> You can't always
[10:41:55] <Eviltwin> If you're just sending data, you can create a <form> with a target of a hidden frame
[10:41:58] <Eviltwin> And submit it
[10:42:15] <Eviltwin> Otherwise you need to look into XSS like JSONP
[10:42:34] <cyberrog> got it
[10:43:09] <xckpd7> alright I think my todo app is done guys.... could I politely request a code review / critique?
[10:43:13] <xckpd7> http://jsfiddle.net/gGVxF/34/
[10:43:26] <xckpd7> satisfied with how it came out
[10:43:49] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Have you used the widget factory before? see ?wf
[10:43:49] <bot-t> xckpd7, The jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[10:44:05] <Eviltwin> Might be a nice way to let JavaScript manipulate the list
[10:44:28] <Eviltwin> Unless your plan is to only have one of these
[10:44:38] <ajpiano> xckpd7: you should also learn to cache your element references as part of the app/component
[10:44:46] <LucaS05> do you know why assigning the result of the next() function to a variable and then initialize an element with the html() function usign that variable causes moving the element found with the next() function into the element initialized with the html() function? is it normal?
[10:44:48] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: this was just to learn
[10:45:07] <xckpd7> ajpiano: yeah I should have made a object literal for caching
[10:45:15] <ajpiano> xckpd7: none of the app frameworks you're considering will have you doing crazy things like $("input[type='text']") every other second
[10:45:26] <ajpiano> ya
[10:45:46] <xckpd7> ajpiano: ideally I would have just used the id that's already on there, and cached that once...
[10:45:52] <ajpiano> sorta
[10:46:19] <xckpd7> but everything else is good?
[10:46:52] <ajpiano> it's a good stepping stone
[10:46:55] <ajpiano> :)
[10:47:17] <ajpiano> if you step into one of those frameworks you'll learn the importance of separating your data from the view layer
[10:47:43] <LucaS05> i'm sorry ....do you have answered to my question? I got some connection problems
[10:47:55] <ajpiano> like, imo, the notion of the way destroyDude works is odd
[10:48:10] <ajpiano> because you don't have the logical concept of a single Todo item
[10:48:22] <ajpiano> so the app just ends up pushing around a bunch of dom elements, same as any other jquery app
[10:48:30] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ LucaS05
[10:48:30] <bot-t> LucaS05, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:48:36] <xckpd7> ajpiano: I totally lost you on that one
[10:48:57] <xckpd7> ajpiano: wait I think I know what you mean
[10:49:09] <xckpd7> ajpiano: well... no I don't :)
[10:49:11] <ajpiano> there's no notion of a logical Todo, just a dom element.
[10:49:20] <ajpiano> in this app
[10:49:47] <ajpiano> xckpd7: like i said, this is a good stepping stone in terms of organisation
[10:49:50] <xckpd7> ajpiano: so what if in my caching portion I do var todo = <li> or something like that
[10:49:59] <ajpiano> no that's not what i'm talking about at all
[10:50:07] <ajpiano> xckpd7: you just have to like, try the other frameworks and read about mvc etc
[10:50:16] <ajpiano> the idea that you're gonna pick this all up in 3 hours
[10:50:25] <ajpiano> is not viable :p
[10:51:43] <xckpd7> ajpiano: fair enough. onto Backbone!
[10:51:48] <ajpiano> exactly :)
[10:51:52] <xckpd7> thanks for the critique
[10:51:56] <ajpiano> xckpd7: ping me when you have that eureka moment
[10:52:03] <Eviltwin> "It's terrible, learn to code." :P
[10:52:07] <ajpiano> and you realise the difference between the model/data and how it's presented :)
[10:54:54] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I've used widget factory once... it's nice for sure, but sometimes I get caught up in the fancy implementations of things without knowing what it brings to the table as opposed to implementing it vanilla
[10:55:23] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: so I figure I use jQuery as a base, try to build out as much as possible, then I will actually "grok" the benefits of using widget factory / backbone / whatever
[10:55:32] <Eviltwin> ?wf @ xckpd7
[10:55:33] <bot-t> xckpd7, The jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[10:55:37] <Eviltwin> Those slides tell you what it brings
[10:56:54] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: yeah I know... "state" and all that jazz... I remember I used it once based on your recomendation, and when I did it, you said it was probably too simple to justify using the widget factory
[10:57:30] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: again, cementing that I need to learn the basics before I fully "grok" the benefits (the slides are clear but I don't fully understand)
[10:58:42] <killer11> are high and low pass rc/rl filters only good for sound? or can they be used for radio aswell? there is attenuation on the cuttoff frequency which leads me to believe you cant use them for radio because it cant give you an extact frequency?
[10:58:45] <Eviltwin> The widget factory is designed aroung the idea of being able to make a particular element be an instance of your widget, make it no longer be an instance of your widget, and (arguably most importantly), make it easy to trigger methods on that widget instance
[10:59:05] <Eviltwin> killer11: I'm not sure you're in the right room for that question
[10:59:24] <killer11> ahhh
[10:59:32] <killer11> jquery
[10:59:42] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: you're either sure or not sure
[10:59:42] <killer11> i thought i was in a differnt channel sorry
[11:00:27] <ajpiano> xckpd7: both what i was saying and the widget factory indeed cement the fact that you need to learn to separate Things from how they are presented in the DOM. whether it's a Todo or a Slider or whatever... separating the stateful data object from the "View" .  either way, you'll be a better programmer for it afterward
[11:00:50] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Okay...
[11:01:00] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: I think that covers all the possibilities...
[11:01:27] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Also, I think ajpiano might know a thing or two about the widget factory :P
[11:03:07] <xckpd7> ajpiano: understood.
[11:04:17] <skitrees> how should I go about extending a UI widget?
[11:04:21] <skitrees> such as UI Sortable
[11:04:27] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: it sounded funny to me at the time
[11:04:31] <skitrees> I would like to add another method, similar to toArray, but my own version
[11:05:02] <skitrees> I see this definition syntax with $.widget('ui.sortable', $.ui.mouse, { ...
[11:05:02] <Eviltwin> skitrees: I believe it is described here: see ?wf
[11:05:02] <bot-t> skitrees, The jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[11:05:04] <skitrees> in the source
[11:05:10] <skitrees> Eviltwin, thanks
[11:06:41] <skitrees> Eviltwin, hmm, ok so I'm not sure what syntax to use here
[11:07:04] <skitrees> I have tried just adding $.widget('ui.sortable', $.ui.mouse, { myMethod: function(foo) {...} });
[11:07:05] <Eviltwin> I'd be surprised if you'd found the right slide already
[11:07:07] <skitrees> but that "doesn't work"
[11:07:20] <skitrees> hehe, ok so it's a ways in there, ok I'll keep going
[11:09:29] <skitrees> hrm, ok so I got to the end of the slides, it's still not clear (without taking the time to follow his complete sequence and test and debug and play with everything, time I don't have) what syntax to use just to simply add a new method to an existing UI object
[11:10:11] <ajpiano> skitrees: $.ui.sortable.prototype.whatever = function() { }; is the easiest
[11:10:31] <Eviltwin> I was wondering if that worked
[11:10:39] <Eviltwin> But does that take care of the bridging?
[11:11:09] <ajpiano> there's nothing to bridge, you directly modified the prototype
[11:11:30] <Eviltwin> Oh, nevermind, I was looking at the _super / _superApply code
[11:11:50] <ryanneufeld> speaking of directly modifying prototypes
[11:11:51] <ajpiano> that is only 1.9 stuff anyway, where i'm not sure if it'll work tbh
[11:12:00] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Y8ZNU/ how can I make this an extension of the Array prototype ?
[11:12:00] <creati29> hi, could anyone please tell me why when i have a variable that logs like this - ft and i am trying to use that as a case in a switch why this doesnt work - case 'ft': ?
[11:12:53] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: You mean something that extends Array?
[11:13:01] <ryanneufeld> yes
[11:13:25] <ryanneufeld> but in such away that I can create distinct instances of it
[11:13:27] <Eviltwin> Make your prototype a []?
[11:13:31] <skitrees> ajpiano, cool thanks, that works great :)
[11:13:43] <skitrees> and that's exactly what I wanted
[11:13:47] <skitrees> awrsum XD
[11:14:08] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: ... I'm missing some knowledge here
[11:15:42] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: hmm I posted on stackoverflow too
[11:15:59] <ryanneufeld> looks like that might get me in the right direction
[11:16:00] <ryanneufeld> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9382953/how-can-i-convert-this-to-be-an-extension-of-the-array-prototype
[11:16:51] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/tNdAU/
[11:17:10] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:17:31] <Eviltwin> Notice how on new instances of Q, I can use Array's push method
[11:17:40] <Eviltwin> But I can also use my new function that I add
[11:18:09] <ryanneufeld> right
[11:18:13] <ryanneufeld> that makes sense
[11:18:19] <ryanneufeld> so in foo
[11:18:44] <ryanneufeld> if you wanted to access some property of Q, how would you do that
[11:18:59] <ryanneufeld> is the context of this the instance?
[11:19:23] <Eviltwin> Here's a more useful example: http://jsfiddle.net/tNdAU/1/
[11:19:24] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[11:19:25] <ryanneufeld> so it is
[11:19:41] <ryanneufeld> Ah, yeah
[11:19:45] <ryanneufeld> thanks, that totally helps
[11:19:55] <ryanneufeld> so in my example then
[11:20:02] <ryanneufeld> I need to bind my functions to the prototype
[11:20:11] <Eviltwin> Yup
[11:20:17] <ryanneufeld> and not inside the constructor as I am now
[11:20:44] <Eviltwin> JavaScript has a ton of different ways to make objects
[11:20:50] <Eviltwin> Objects with methods
[11:20:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I know
[11:20:59] <Eviltwin> Some of them have different features / conveniences
[11:21:38] <ryanneufeld> i see
[11:22:08] <ryanneufeld> would you recommend the path i'm going down now for a simple queue ?
[11:22:35] <Eviltwin> Is this like a work queue?
[11:22:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah kinda
[11:23:06] <ryanneufeld> the intent is that various scripts on the page can _q.push([],[],[])
[11:23:17] <ryanneufeld> where each array is a series of commands to execute
[11:23:40] <ryanneufeld> and the Queue once initialized will execute any that are in it
[11:23:46] <LucaS05> does the remove() function is not allowed in jsfiddle?
[11:24:01] <ryanneufeld> and then catch any further .push() to the array
[11:24:42] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: I got the idea from how Google ga.js appears on the surface to work
[11:24:46] <oxez> Hello. I'm using $("#element").append(data), where data is a huge block of html retrieved in ajax. It works fine in IE9, FF (latest), chrome and opera. To make it work with IE7/8 I have to use: document.getElementById("element").innerHTML += data . Is there somethign I can do to make it work with jQuery().append too?
[11:25:17] <ajpiano> oxez: IE does not like putting in malformed HTML with .append()
[11:25:24] <ajpiano> i'll bet you dollars to donuts you've got something wrong with your HTML
[11:26:17] <oxez> ajpiano: I have <script> tags as well, they work fine under other browsers, could that be a problem with IE as well?
[11:26:32] <ajpiano> script tags usually aren'ta  problem from this perspective
[11:27:10] <oxez> Ok, thanks I'll go verify the generated html
[11:27:50] <lyscer> is there a way to assign an input mask to an element in the html and not have it in the document.ready definition?
[11:28:59] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Maybe something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/y8usd/
[11:29:10] <lyscer> or is there a particular input mask plugin that everyone prefers?
[11:29:11] <Eviltwin> Still lets you manipulate the queue freely
[11:29:17] <Eviltwin> The new functionality doesn't replace the old
[11:29:42] <skitrees> so, now that I've solved my problem the hack way, I'm hoping maybe one of you kind folks can shed some light on why I couldn't get sortable.serialize to work as I wished
[11:29:59] <skitrees> we've got a custom attribute on our elements called data-id rather than just id
[11:30:12] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yeah, that's kinda what I'm going for
[11:30:13] <skitrees> i noticed in the docs that supposedly, I could pass attribute to the options param for serialize
[11:30:26] <skitrees> and it would use a custom attribute instead of id, but I just couldn't get this to work
[11:30:32] <skitrees> my syntax was basically this...
[11:30:34] <ryanneufeld> but the function could be different for each queued item
[11:31:04] <skitrees> var fooData = $('#mySortableThingie').sortable('serialize', {'attribute': 'data-id'});
[11:31:19] <skitrees> and, while I was not getting any syntax errors in the firebug console, neither was I getting any actual output
[11:31:30] <skitrees> ajpiano, Eviltwin, any ideas what I was doing wrong there?
[11:31:57] <skitrees> (as I said, I "fixed" the problem with a hack by just extending the prototype and adding a custom function that was a duplicate of toArray but with 'id' changed to 'data-id' and everything works nicely
[11:32:01] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: but for some reason, not immediately apparent to me, the "xxx" isn't logging
[11:32:13] <skitrees> but, being the stickler that I am for process, I was hoping to get this working "properly" so to speak
[11:32:24] <ryanneufeld> OH
[11:32:27] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: I see it now
[11:33:50] <chisler> am trying to find a string in a comment in the html of a page
[11:34:08] <chisler> don't know which element it might be in (obv it's in body somewhere ;) )
[11:34:10] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: I would probably do something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/y8usd/1/
[11:34:22] <Eviltwin> Where each pushed thing is a function
[11:34:22] <chisler> any ideas how to use jQuery to find it?
[11:34:29] <Eviltwin> And each call specifies the arguments to it
[11:34:47] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Yeah, the point is you could still use .shift() to manipulate the queue without running it
[11:34:58] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:35:03] <ryanneufeld> which is what I was after
[11:35:17] <Eviltwin> Oh, oops, accidentally put the params in the shift too
[11:35:20] <Eviltwin> This instead: http://jsfiddle.net/y8usd/2/
[11:36:54] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: okay, so that's good
[11:37:08] <creati29> if im using a switch statement inside an each iteration will the case only be determined once? don't see why it would but I have 2 cases - 'ft' and 'type' the first to be iterated over is case 'type' and this fires correctly, but case 'ft' refuses
[11:37:54] <Jon47> creati29 fiddle please
[11:38:31] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: but it's not quite what i'm getting at...
[11:40:10] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Y8ZNU/13/ maybe that will help illustrate the goal
[11:41:28] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: also not the q1 and q2 at the top of the page. I need to figure out how to maintain those existing values
[11:43:43] <verdoc> is .ajaxError() without a selector the same as .ajaxSetup({error: function(){}}) ?
[11:43:59] <fatninja> in the document.ready function I have an alert('welcome')  <--- test purposes. In my html file I perform an ajax post and set a div with the data I got from it , ex : $.post( postTo, form.serialize() , function(data) { $( "#showRaport" ).empty().append(data); });          . Seems ok, but after it's posted the alert('welcome') is called again. Why?
[11:44:13] <sven_oostenbrink> While inside an $('object').blur(function(){}); how can I find out what element got focus?
[11:47:28] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/y8usd/3/
[11:47:58] <Eviltwin> Gotta go
[11:47:59] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[11:48:11] <dangerousdave> would someone kindly give me a code review please? http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/9214/first-jquery-project-a-simple-lightbox
[11:48:34] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:53:22] <poppiez> how do you inject inline CSS declarations using JS?
[11:54:36] <LucaS05> i've this situation http://jsfiddle.net/wB7Qy/ retrieving an element with the next() function and then using the html() function to initialize another element using the result of the next cause the "next" element moving in the html
[11:55:45] <LucaS05> you can see there how the ul that i use with the next() are moved from the original list and than moved in the div element
[11:57:08] <ajpiano> LucaS05: it's not valid to have something nested directly inside a <ul> that's not an <li>
[11:57:23] <ajpiano> wait nm, misread
[11:57:59] <LucaS05> ok :D
[11:58:32] <fatninja> in the document.ready function I have an alert('welcome')  <--- test purposes. In my html file I perform an ajax post and set a div with the data I got from it , ex : $.post( postTo, form.serialize() , function(data) { $( "#showRaport" ).empty().append(data); });          . Seems ok, but after it's posted the alert('welcome') is called again. Why?
[11:58:42] <LucaS05> anyway don't worry about the visual effects that are not good try to see what i'm saying with firebug ;)
[11:59:14] <LukeNukem> why isnt jquery working in jsfiddle?
[11:59:28] <ajpiano> LucaS05: the way you're doing it now, it physically moves the elements,
[11:59:39] <ajpiano> LucaS05: this might be what you want http://jsfiddle.net/wB7Qy/1/
[12:00:06] <ajpiano> LucaS05: you want to copy the html of the thing, not move the actual elements
[12:00:09] <ajpiano> i assume?
[12:00:14] <LucaS05> yes
[12:00:24] <LucaS05> is what i want to do ;)
[12:00:39] <ajpiano> LucaS05: look at what i posted above
[12:00:42] <LucaS05> LukeNukem: do you choose onDomReady on the left?
[12:00:50] <LucaS05> yes i'm trying it on my website ;)
[12:00:53] <ajpiano> LucaS05: also var currList = $(this).next().clone(); will also work
[12:01:13] <LucaS05> thanks ;)
[12:01:30] <LukeNukem> LucaS05, i did now
[12:01:33] <LukeNukem> but still does not work
[12:02:13] <LukeNukem> anyways, i have no option other than to explain my problem them
[12:02:20] <LucaS05> but why using the next() and the html() with the next() element caused the element to move the actual element?
[12:02:27] <ajpiano> LucaS05: because that's how it works
[12:02:37] <ajpiano> when you pass an actual jquery object or element to .html()
[12:02:38] <LucaS05> ok good to know!
[12:02:43] <ajpiano> or append, or prepend, etc.
[12:03:15] <LucaS05> i will read about the .html() function on the doc!
[12:03:17] <LukeNukem> ok, so i have a div which is hidden..lets call it topBar
[12:03:27] <LukeNukem> then i have a div called toggleBar
[12:03:31] <LucaS05> LukeNukem sorry i got to go
[12:03:38] <LukeNukem> when toggleBar is clicked, toggleBar is hidden and topBar is shown
[12:03:40] <LucaS05> see you later maybe!
[12:03:48] <LukeNukem> but as soon as i click on toggleBar and take my mouse off there
[12:03:55] <LukeNukem> topBar comes but disappears
[12:05:10] <LukeNukem> LucaS05, see ya
[12:05:14] <LukeNukem> so anyone can help me out?
[12:08:27] <WebDragon> so with www.w-m-t.com/ the Products mega-menu is managed entirely by css (no jquery involved) except for an IE fix that vanishes the homepage slidebar when the menu's dropped because it persisted in appearing above the navmenu no matter what I did
[12:09:33] <WebDragon> however, at the client's insistence that it's "too sensitive" (meaning it's too fast) I'd like to know if there's an accepted method to slow down the existing visibility changes on the dropdowns when the navbar is hovered
[12:09:50] <rock_star> Got a cool Jquery effect going with ~animated stars over a logo (client request)... so, how do I get the span overlaying the div with the logo img in it?
[12:10:11] <WebDragon> myself I think of it as "responsive" but the client is always right, so 'too fast' it is
[12:11:49] <WebDragon> position relative on containing div around logo, display:block on span, with height-width set to same as div/logo, and position absolute top left and z-index it higher than the logo
[12:11:56] <WebDragon> rock_star: ^
[12:11:58] <WebDragon> that was to you
[12:13:02] <danzik17> WebDragon: you can use something like ?fadeIn if you wanted, but it's not pure CSS of course -  i'm assuming you need to target a larger # of browsers than currently support CSS transitions
[12:13:20] <sven_oostenbrink> While inside an $('object').blur(function(){}); how can I find out what element got focus?
[12:13:30] <sven_oostenbrink> As in, object lost focus, but which one got the focus?
[12:13:37] <fatninja> $(document).ready() gets called , or reloaded after an ajax post, why ?!
[12:14:01] <WebDragon> danzik17: we've got a large footer too, to handle some of the issues with mobile browsers in this context, since there's no click-lock on the dropdowns
[12:15:20] <CodeZombie> is there a way to detect when someone tries to drag an element that isn't draggable?
[12:16:05] <WebDragon> danzik17: I'm primarily interested in finding out what the prevailing method of 'enhancing' a pure css hover-state affecting visibility would be .. just a .hover( function { fade-in}, function {fade-out} ) ?
[12:16:13] <LukeNukem> someone please take a look
[12:16:13] <WebDragon> and then tweak speed according to taste ?
[12:16:14] <LukeNukem> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9384501/jquery-hide-show-weird-glitch
[12:16:20] <LukeNukem> its tough to explain over chat without jsfiddle working properly
[12:16:40] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: tried checking with #jsfiddle ?
[12:16:58] <LukeNukem> my problem is jquery
[12:16:59] <LukeNukem> not jsfiddle
[12:17:07] <danzik17> WebDragon: if i had to do it, that's probably how i'd try it.  see if maybe modernizr can feature detect CSS transitions, and provide a JS equivalent for browsers lacking it.
[12:17:15] <WebDragon> 'jsfiddle not working properly' should be reported to #jsfiddle channel
[12:17:19] <danieliser> not sure why this click event inside .load() callback isnt working.. $(data).find('#cancel-comment-reply').click(function()
[12:17:20] <LukeNukem> can you please check that so link WebDragon
[12:17:23] <danieliser> any ideas?
[12:18:09] <LukeNukem> ok now please check my link WebDragon , i've reported
[12:18:49] <WebDragon> your css may additionally be affecting the visibility, particularly if something else is z-indexed high enough that it interferes
[12:18:57] <fatninja> $(document).ready() gets called , or reloaded after an ajax post, why ? The thing is I have a group function that increments the index with 1, ( before the ajax post ) , now it increases it with 2 when I click next. The function within .ready() gets called twice. wtf ?
[12:19:37] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: at www.w-m-t.com the Products Mega-Menu until today had a small barely visible problem : the z-index on the slidebar pick-it nav (the little boxes) was z-indexed to 200 while the mega-menu was z-indexed to 199 -- I never noticed
[12:20:13] <WebDragon> thus, moving the mouse to the mega-menu's 'white area' instinctively moving the mouse out of the way of the text but leaving the megamenu visible, caused it to immediately vanish the second the mouse touched the pick-it nav
[12:20:24] <phronline> hello, can somebody help me with php?
[12:20:30] <WebDragon> it's not zindexed to 195 - barely-visible finicky problem solved
[12:20:37] <phronline> i have an array: Array ( [0] => 210112 [1] => 040212 [2] => 070112 [3] => 110212 [4] => 140112 [5] => 280112 )
[12:20:42] <phronline> those numbres are dates in this format: ddmmyy
[12:20:49] <phronline> i want to sort the array by the month and day, is it possible?
[12:20:58] <WebDragon> check z-index on nearby elements to make sure you're not accidentally mousing over the wrong thing, causing the normal css to unhover the element
[12:21:00] <LukeNukem> phronline, ##php
[12:21:04] <LukeNukem> this is #jquery
[12:21:25] <phronline> LukeNukem i cant join :(
[12:21:36] <WebDragon> phronline: /msg nickserv help register
[12:21:43] <LukeNukem> phronline, yeah do that
[12:21:53] <LukeNukem> you can try using the now function or something in php
[12:22:19] <dddbmt> Hey guys I have a question which requires a little more space - I've written it here: http://pastie.org/3429385
[12:22:21] <WebDragon> many freenode channels require that you register with nickserv before joining the channel
[12:22:26] <LukeNukem> WebDragon, so my topbar is z-index: 1;
[12:22:58] <WebDragon> some other z-indexed element nearby may be interfering with the layers you're mousing through causing css to fire off an onmouseout or similar
[12:23:23] <LucaS05> LukeNukem you have resolved with jsfiddle?
[12:23:25] <WebDragon> this is just a guess, having gone through this just today myself with something else -- that little pickit was the wrong z-index for weeks
[12:23:42] <WebDragon> I never saw it because the blue of the pickit was so close to the white bg and I wasn't looking for it
[12:23:44] <LukeNukem> LucaS05, no
[12:23:45] <igcewieling> I'm having an odd issue -- not sure if it is a jquery issue, html issue, or css issue.   I have some buttons which hightlight when hovered.  My issue us that if the pointer is near the edge of the button the button highlights, but does not do anything when clicked.  move the pointer closer to the center of the button and it work just fine.  does anyone have any suggestions?
[12:24:00] <LukeNukem> WebDragon, is that your website
[12:24:26] <elb0w> So im trying to do http://pastie.org/3429400 cm is in its parent functions scope. For some reason it seems to be hitting the method twice
[12:24:30] <WebDragon> igcewieling: your css on the A: element hasn't given it enough height/width to fill the button area completely. your hover works, but your nav's not yet hovered so it can't be clicked
[12:24:31] <igcewieling> My first thought was to wrap every button in a span and attach the .click() to the span not the button, but that seems like an ugly hack.
[12:24:33] <elb0w> any idea?
[12:24:38] <LukeNukem> WebDragon, only my topbar has z-index
[12:24:38] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: one of our clients
[12:24:39] <LukeNukem> set to 1
[12:24:50] <LukeNukem> none of the other elements have z-index property
[12:25:02] <igcewieling> WebDragon: I do not have an A element.  I have <button> with .click()
[12:25:06] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: is anything else on the page being managed by jquery plugins that may be adding wrappers with their own zindexes
[12:25:13] <pace_t_zulu> so i'm doing multiple ajax posts ... i want an event to fire after all of them have completed ... normally with $.post i'd just attach a .complete(function(){}) but i can't have the event happen until *all* posts have completed ... any ideas?
[12:25:20] <LukeNukem> WebDragon, nope
[12:25:24] <LukeNukem> nothing that uses zindexes
[12:25:32] <LukeNukem> and nothing is being added either
[12:25:44] <LucaS05> remember that z-index elements must have a position property like position:relative if this could help :D
[12:25:50] <WebDragon> igcewieling: oh so you're using <button> not <li><a /></li>
[12:25:55] <WebDragon> my bad
[12:25:59] <elb0w> nvm
[12:25:59] <WebDragon> hmmm
[12:26:15] <igcewieling> WebDragon: correct.  <button id="dashboard_btn"><b> DASHBOARD </b></button>
[12:26:17] <WebDragon> that's a new one. igcewieling is that consistent across browsers? (opera firefox chrome in current versions) ?
[12:26:38] <igcewieling> WebDragon: This is an internal app, only tested with chrome
[12:26:53] <WebDragon> igcewieling: see if it's happening in FF9 and Opera 11.61
[12:27:18] <WebDragon> this will help confirm whether the bug's specific to chrome or not
[12:27:20] <igcewieling> WebDragon: it seems like if I'm within a few pixels of the edge it doesn't work.  The button depresses, as it should according to the css.   WebDragon, I'll check the other browsers.
[12:27:27] <snover> pace_t_zulu: this is why promises exist
[12:27:31] <WebDragon> ok, good luck
[12:27:43] <pace_t_zulu> snover: ?
[12:27:45] <igcewieling> WebDragon: I would be surpized if the page worked in any other browser.
[12:28:15] <WebDragon> I'd suggest developing with opera and chrome both -- obviating the need to fix in firefox 99% of the time)
[12:28:54] <mathi> when I wrap html data in a jquery object using $(), what affects the performance most, the length of the html data to wrap, or the number of elements that the html data contains?
[12:28:55] <igcewieling> WebDragon: in IE (*8) same issue.
[12:29:00] <WebDragon> I've discovered that when I develop with Opera as the primary browser I have fewer cross-browser bugs to fix later in testing than I do if I develop with chrome/ff/ie as the primary testing browser
[12:29:08] <WebDragon> igcewieling: weird issue indeed
[12:29:09] <pace_t_zulu> snover: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ ?
[12:29:19] <igcewieling> WebDragon: This is an internal app.  It will only be used with Chrome
[12:29:31] <WebDragon> igcewieling: how many pixels from the edge can you mouse in and get the hover effect before the click starts to work
[12:29:41] <WebDragon> igcewieling: future-proof your apps anyway
[12:29:46] <igcewieling> WebDragon: hard to tell, 1 - 3 pixels.
[12:29:51] <WebDragon> google "technical debt"
[12:29:53] <JAAulde> I am looking at upgrading a major production system from jQuery 1.6.2 to jQuery 1.7.1.  I generally try to include UI in such upgrades. I'm currently on UI 1.8.14, and the latest available seems to be 1.8.17.  Is 1.8.17 considered stable with jQuery 1.7.1?
[12:30:45] <pace_t_zulu> snover: thanks for the 'promises' clue ... helped me google
[12:31:07] <davidangel> Hi everyone. I'm using jQuery tools in a WordPress theme and my slideshow is not auto playing
[12:31:12] <WebDragon> igcewieling: 1-3 pixels .. tough to say whether that's bug-worthy -- that really depends on your design's intent and complexity at that point. are you cramming several buttons next to each other in a very confined space?
[12:31:13] <davidangel> Instead I'm getting this error: TypeError: Object #<r> has no method 'bind'
[12:31:17] <WebDragon> like a calendar or somesuch ?
[12:31:38] <igcewieling> WebDragon: no, the buttons are not all crammed together.  the intent is to recognize the click when the button is highlighted.
[12:31:58] <WebDragon> igcewieling: and the click isn't firing through to jquery either then?
[12:32:16] <igcewieling> WebDragon: How would I tell?  put an alert() in the click handler?
[12:32:23] <Zzaichik> davidangel: can you recreate a working example in jsfiddle or something por favor?
[12:32:33] <WebDragon> igcewieling: have it increment a nearby span with a counter
[12:32:35] <LukeNukem> WebDragon, damn the guys at SO are gods
[12:32:41] <davidangel> http://retrofoam.com/ Anyone care to check that error?
[12:32:43] <LukeNukem> i figured why its disappearing
[12:32:47] <WebDragon> igcewieling: easiest visual clue without having to click-away alert dialogs by the hundreds :D
[12:32:53] <JAAulde> LukeNukem: we try :P
[12:32:57] <LukeNukem> because the page is reloading, i forgot to add # or e.preventDefault();
[12:33:02] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: heh
[12:33:06] <LukeNukem> JAAulde, i know :)
[12:33:06] <igcewieling> when a button is selected, it has a thin dotted border just inside the edge of the button.  It seems if I click on or outside that border it does not register.
[12:33:26] <LukeNukem> WebDragon, the toggle bar is an href, i set it to blank so page was reloading.
[12:33:37] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: also know the diff between preventDefault stopPropagation and stopImmediatePropagation
[12:33:42] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: doh
[12:34:04] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: also return false would be a good idea ;)
[12:34:13] <WebDragon> depending on what you're doing with it
[12:34:24] <igcewieling> WebDragon: something like: counter = $('#mydiv).val(); counter = counter + 1;
[12:34:31] <JAAulde> WebDragon: returning false is generally bad
[12:34:33] <WebDragon> igcewieling: try setting outline:0 on the css for the button
[12:34:38] <igcewieling> ah, sorry, that would be .text() not .val() right?
[12:34:45] <WebDragon> JAAulde: depends on the circumstances of what you're trying to do
[12:35:39] <igcewieling> WebDragon: that made the line go away, but that is all
[12:35:44] <WebDragon> igcewieling: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2418905/jquery-incrementing-an-id-and-var-on-click
[12:35:58] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to do a IF statement with an event
[12:36:00] <danieliser> can you initialize responseText as a jquery object? i cant seem to search it for children
[12:36:17] <yamahaalex37> like if (#id1 || #id2).click
[12:36:19] <johnkpaul> danieliser: do you mean that your repsonsetext is a html string?
[12:36:19] <JAAulde> WebDragon: perhaps, but return false covers a VERY narrow set of intentions, and is generally misused
[12:36:29] <WebDragon> igcewieling: I found that outline: css property is considerably annoying when not accounted for, HOWEVER I do occasionally use it over border: property when I don't want to add 1px to dimensions of whatever I'm playing with
[12:36:32] <johnkpaul> yamahaalex37: do you want it to add the click handler to both elements?
[12:36:34] <JAAulde> WebDragon: A good article on the matter: http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[12:36:35] <johnkpaul> if so, you can use comma
[12:36:45] <WebDragon> JAAulde: good to know about. bookmarking
[12:36:48] <danieliser> johnkpaul: yes  several elements inside a div. i need to add a click event to the close element
[12:36:51] <johnkpaul> $("#id1, #id2").click
[12:36:55] <yamahaalex37> john yes, cool! thanks
[12:37:25] <johnkpaul> danieliser: you need to add that text to the dom first, and then you can add a click
[12:37:42] <rzec> is jQuery.tmpl still under active development, I though I heard that is was dead?
[12:37:49] <johnkpaul> $(responseText).appendTo(document.body).children("your_element_selector").click()
[12:37:52] <danieliser> i thought that .load() loaded it to the dom automatically before its callback.
[12:38:21] <johnkpaul> oh, I idn't realize you were using .load
[12:38:22] <yamahaalex37> johnkpaul, that doesnt seem to work
[12:38:23] <johnkpaul> yes, it does
[12:38:27] <yamahaalex37> $("#btnSwitchRegister", "#btnSwitchOneRegister").click(function(){
[12:38:35] <danieliser> my mistake..if thats the case i can just use the parent that i appended to to find the first close element
[12:38:47] <JAAulde> Is UI 1.8.17 considered stable with jQuery 1.7.1?
[12:38:54] <yamahaalex37> johnkpaul, as soon as I remove either one, it does work
[12:39:07] <yamahaalex37> oh sorry
[12:39:12] <yamahaalex37> thought i had to seperate the ", "
[12:39:14] <danieliser>  $("#btnSwitchRegister, #btnSwitchOneRegister"
[12:39:27] <yamahaalex37> thanks
[12:40:01] <danieliser> johnkpaul: does that change things? using .load() i mean
[12:40:15] <johnkpaul> well, you don't need to append child, it will already be there
[12:40:39] <JAAulde> yamahaalex37: making them separate parameters causes the second selector to be used as context (and improperly so, as selectors shouldn't be used as context)
[12:40:56] <yamahaalex37> ok, i apprecaite that
[12:41:00] <johnkpaul> danieliser: but you do need to query $(this).find("your_selector_here").click
[12:41:17] <danieliser> johnkpaul im loading into a jquery object that isnt in the dom yet
[12:41:27] <danieliser> var commentForm = $('<div id="comment-form">').load()
[12:41:52] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[12:41:55] <danieliser> then in the callback i .after('.the-comment-body')
[12:42:03] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't believe that you can attach events to elements not in the dom
[12:42:10] <johnkpaul> but someone else would have to confirm that, I don't know
[12:42:27] <danieliser> ok.. i can do it the other way $parent.find('cancel:first')
[12:42:53] <WebDragon> JAAulde: "Top, Bottom or Somewhere in the Middle" was worth the price of the ticket
[12:43:00] <danieliser> i believe you are right.. cause nothing ive tried has worked so far.. soon as i do it differently though it works fine
[12:43:17] <WebDragon> thanks bunches for that link. very useful info for me, and I can see I've got more than a few scripts to refactor now
[12:43:23] <JAAulde> WebDragon: what?
[12:43:35] <WebDragon> JAAulde: http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/ <-- from this
[12:44:05] <davidangel> Just upgraded jQuery Tools, can anyone look at this and guess why the strange 'extra flash' on transition? http://retrofoam.com/
[12:44:08] <JAAulde> WebDragon: ahh, cool
[12:44:11] * WebDragon hands the carafe of DragonCoffeeâ„¢ to JAAulde so he can expand his attention span with the kind of awareness that only comes after a fresh cuppa
[12:44:18] <WebDragon> =)
[12:44:20] * WebDragon runs

[12:44:36] * WebDragon hides a chuckle in his dragon sized mug of coffee
[12:45:15] <WebDragon> your link hadn't even scrolled off the xchat page when I responded. xD
[12:45:31] <WebDragon> (I read pretty fast)
[12:45:53] <JAAulde> WebDragon: I know, and I assumed you were mentioning something from the article, but "worth th eprice of the ticket" confused me
[12:46:02] <WebDragon> ahh
[12:46:23] <Carlitta87> how can i do this with jquery http://amanoka.com/?
[12:46:38] <WebDragon> 'price of the ticket' basically meaning "I had to go somewhere else and read something of some technical detail requiring understanding of the subject as the 'price of the ticket'"
[12:46:47] <JAAulde> lol @ "do this with jQuery" followed by a hyper link
[12:47:02] <JAAulde> WebDragon: cool, cool
[12:47:03] <Carlitta87> the white part that is?
[12:47:18] <WebDragon> Carlitta87: can you be slightly more specific as to what exactly you wish you could make jquery do?
[12:48:12] <johnkpaul> WebDragon: it all
[12:48:21] <johnkpaul> Carlitta87 wants it all
[12:48:34] <WebDragon> I remember that guy
[12:48:39] <johnkpaul> it's $(document.body).create("amanoka")
[12:48:40] <Carlitta87> sry, i shud have been more specifis... on the page, wen u click on the link, i wud like the slide effect...where the content comes out....WebDragon
[12:48:45] <Carlitta87> i figured out everything else
[12:48:49] <Carlitta87> its just that part
[12:48:54] <WebDragon> in the commercials, with the squeezy-tux or whatever, stressed out executive who "wants it all"

[12:49:26] <WebDragon> davidangel: FOAC ?
[12:49:32] <WebDragon> err FOUC
[12:49:37] <johnkpaul> flash of unstyled content
[12:50:02] <rock_star> Thanks WebDragon.
[12:50:08] <Carlitta87> johnkpaul thank u :)
[12:50:12] <davidangel> WebDragon: eh?
[12:50:37] <rock_star> actually... I got something working using left:-500px type method... the span is relative and zindex set to 2
[12:50:43] <WebDragon> rock_star: welcome :) glad I was able to be of assistance
[12:50:49] <johnkpaul> Carlitta87: no problem, have fun
[12:51:19] <WebDragon> davidangel: not sure what's flashing transition.. which specific element do you refer to?
[12:51:24] <rock_star> WebDragon: now my deal is... its working fine in Firefox, but not at all in Safari... and I am not sure what to change to make it work in Safari
[12:53:29] <davidangel> WebDragon: http://pastebin.com/Q4QdmuA1
[12:53:32] <WebDragon> rock_star: this is why debugger exists :) tried looking in firebug lite in safari? or using whatever debugger safari has? (does it? I don't know for sure)
[12:54:00] <rock_star> safari has a built in Inspector just like fb
[12:54:00] <JAAulde> WebDragon: Safari has a full blown developer tool set built in
[12:54:08] <WebDragon> davidangel: I don't know exactly what element you're referring to that's flashing -- it works fine here on opera 11.61 from what I can see
[12:54:13] <WebDragon> JAAulde: sweet
[12:54:19] * WebDragon files that away for reference
[12:55:03] <davidangel> WebDragon: Oh, I see. It's happening on Chrome and Safari. The slider on the top of page is like, transitioning twice rapidly instead of once.
[12:55:56] <WebDragon> hm
[12:55:57] <rock_star> welp, I think Im gunna havta do more like you mentioned webdragon... cuz inspector is showing the stars offscreen to the left..   so my -500px like stuff is breaking Safari
[12:56:13] <WebDragon> davidangel: like it'd accepted a double-click? or the transition is firing twice?
[12:56:46] <davidangel> WebDragon: it's like it's firing twice
[12:56:59] <WebDragon> rock_star: does your page validate 100% clean html5 and css3 ?
[12:57:06] <davidangel> and then later on it syncs up
[12:57:08] <davidangel> really strange
[12:57:16] <WebDragon> davidangel: *nod* yeah there's ways to prevent it from double-queueing
[12:57:24] <rock_star> hah, I doubt it... havent checked lately
[12:57:46] <davidangel> WebDragon: Know where I could learn about those ways?
[12:57:48] <WebDragon> you might have a quirky mouse that one browser intercepts as separate clicks when others only think it as one, because they were too close together for humans to click that fast
[12:58:01] <WebDragon> (just a guess there)
[12:58:43] <WebDragon> davidangel: google up jquery event queueing
[12:59:30] <WebDragon> there's tons of various things written about it to prevent a series of clicks or a series of circular hovers from making a slider fire 'waytoomanytimes'
[13:01:18] <davidangel> WebDragon: would that apply even before a user clicks or hovers?
[13:02:59] <Mattias> does jquery have regex in the selectors? say a cms generates link-0, link-1 etc, can I do something like 'link-#' then with the .each, that will actually do real counting each loop?
[13:03:18] <Mattias> maybe not regex, just something for numerals
[13:03:45] <Mattias> ah nvm,
[13:03:47] <Mattias> found it
[13:03:49] <amalvagomes> If I am writing a plugin function and want to have the function take another jQuery object as a parameter, how might I accomplish this?  I just get errors now.
[13:03:51] <john-dev> you mean wildcard
[13:04:09] <Mattias> john-dev: .each does have a counter,  .each(function(index) {});
[13:04:11] <Mattias> the index one :)
[13:04:18] <Mattias> just found it
[13:05:21] <WebDragon> davidangel: because the 2nd transition fires before the browsr finishes doing somethin so it appears to fire twice in rapid succession?
[13:05:25] <WebDragon> are you preloading images ?
[13:05:57] <Mattias> I have one more question though, which is faster to use for moving dom around:  .insertBefore()   or   .detach().prependTo()   ?
[13:06:16] <Mattias> if anyone did any benchmarking :)
[13:09:09] <john-dev> Mattias, thats what you are looking for
[13:09:10] <john-dev> $('#myEle\\S*').each();
[13:09:25] <rock_star> ok, now I got it to work in safari, although now in firefox the span is to the right of the div
[13:09:57] <Mattias> john-dev: thanks
[13:10:05] <rock_star> almost there! but something I am missing to make it work in both browsers (havent tested chrome yet)
[13:10:23] <john-dev> Mattias, try it first.. looks like it's an old no more available way..
[13:11:07] <amalvagomes> Anyone?
[13:11:42] <Mattias> john-dev: just realized, why make it so complex.. [class^=link]  this should work I guess.
[13:12:19] * Mattias is so tired -.-
[13:12:23] <john-dev> y
[13:12:24] <john-dev> $("div[id^=pnl]").hide();
[13:12:26] <john-dev> thats it
[13:14:52] <Carlitta87> WebDragon: still there?
[13:22:30] <Chopps> quick question, can i add a function to the load method?? i have something like this: $("#parent_div").load('consult.php?action=load'); and i want to append something after the load is done completely
[13:22:40] <xckpd7> so I've been mucking around with Backbone for the past 2 hours.... there is a lot of stuff here to learn... any tips for moving forward?
[13:23:01] <xckpd7> I was looking at the Peepcode screeencasts but they're based on version 0.5 and it's already approaching 1.0....
[13:23:19] <danzik17> xckpd7: https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals
[13:23:35] <john-dev> Chopps, .load only has an on complete event, not an on success event.. so you have to build that success stuff on your own
[13:23:54] <john-dev> so yes, you can..
[13:24:28] <Chopps> thanks john-dev, thats what i wanted to know :D
[13:24:33] <john-dev> :-)
[13:24:56] <john-dev> $.ajax fe has an onSuccess callback
[13:28:09] <xckpd7> danzik17++
[13:28:11] <Chopps> i dont need ajax for this john-dev, the on complete event its enough for what im doing, thanks again
[13:28:20] <john-dev> ok, yaw!
[13:41:13] <radiaz> Ciao a Tutti!!!
[13:41:17] <radiaz> !list
[13:41:21] <radiaz> !list
[13:42:45] <keirlav87> can anyone please tell me why alert('hi'); is firing on every iteration of my each function, but alert('hello') is only firing once? < http://jsfiddle.net/N8zdG/7/
[13:43:12] <WeezzZ> hi chan
[13:43:53] <qom2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9385635/add-automation-to-a-jquery-content-slider
[13:43:56] <snover> ?alert @ keirlav87
[13:43:57] <bot-t> keirlav87, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[13:44:30] <keirlav87> sorry, I was just making it obvious :P
[13:44:58] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/N8zdG/8/ <- heres console.log instead of alert
[13:45:27] <spectre^> When I get frustrated I often use alert too. :P
[13:45:34] <LukeNukem> how can i margin top in animate?
[13:45:35] <LukeNukem> marginTop?
[13:47:24] <john-dev> y
[13:47:35] <john-dev> next time just try it before you ask :-)
[13:48:11] <LukeNukem> i want jquery to scroll down a div of mine
[13:48:13] <keirlav87> can anyone please explain why my first switch is firing on each iteration but the nested switch only fires once?
[13:48:15] <LukeNukem> how do i fuckin do this shit?
[13:48:39] <LukeNukem>        $("#topBar").animate({         marginTop: "10px"    });
[13:48:41] <LukeNukem> why u no work
[13:50:15] <WebDragon> LukeNukem: is the item in question not display: block ? if it's display: inline natively then the margin might not have any effect
[13:50:31] <LukeNukem> its block
[13:50:39] <WebDragon> also if the content is positioned, that might affect things too
[13:50:54] <LukeNukem> its position:fixed
[13:51:33] <WebDragon> http://jqapi.com/#p=animate for some examples
[13:51:39] <WebDragon> you might need to animate its wrapper
[13:52:02] <WebDragon> you'll have to play with it a bit after you check out the examples there
[13:53:09] <LukeNukem> ok, the div should be up above the screen and hidden
[13:53:15] <LucaS05> sorry how can i see which line gives me uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #
[13:53:18] <LukeNukem> on click of another button, it should scroll down
[13:53:18] <LucaS05> ?
[13:53:20] <LukeNukem> how can i do that
[13:55:18] <Kambfhase> jslint.com @ LucaS05
[13:55:31] <Kambfhase> paste your code there
[13:56:10] <Majicpanda> whats a way to include jquery calls to items that you bring in with an ajax call?
[13:56:20] <Majicpanda> if i populate a div with a new form field, i want to make a call on it
[13:56:21] <Mattias> keirlav87: because there are 9 ft's and only one type's
[13:56:48] <john-dev> Majicpanda, .on
[13:57:16] <LucaS05> ok
[13:57:33] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: i'm about to take off
[13:57:33] <ajpiano> but
[13:57:38] <ajpiano> here is how you scroll a div in jquery
[13:57:39] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/mUJfA/
[13:57:39] <keirlav87> no thats not the problem, if that were the problem then console.log('wont fire!') would be executed
[13:57:42] <keirlav87> check this http://jsfiddle.net/N8zdG/11/
[13:57:43] <ajpiano> click the button
[13:58:01] <Majicpanda> john-dev: is that very browser friendly
[13:58:17] <LukeNukem> thanks ajpiano
[13:58:18] <Majicpanda> as long as javascript is enabled obviously
[13:58:30] <Mattias> keirlav87: case 1: always matches because there is only one element hourlyTarget, jobType then fetches all elements with class .hidden and goes through them.  9 of those are "ft" while 1 is "type"
[13:58:32] <john-dev> Majicpanda, sure, as long as js s enabled
[13:58:42] <john-dev> why would you go to #jquery else?
[13:58:47] <keirlav87> mattias I see what you are saying, but thats not what the problem is
[13:58:48] <xckpd7> how do you unbind jQuery validate?
[13:58:49] <hlveheart> o:
[13:58:50] <hlveheart> How would I go about using Javascript/jQuery to look through the contents of a DIV for an A tag by its' anchor text, and adding a class to said A tag?
[13:58:57] <keirlav87> place a console.log inside of case 'ft':
[13:59:03] <keirlav87> you'll see that it won't execute
[13:59:07] <LucaS05> Kambfhase it gives me a lot of error about jquery...qny chance to include it?
[13:59:23] <Mattias> ah
[13:59:23] <john-dev> hlveheart, .find .each
[13:59:27] <keirlav87> the problem is that the nested switch is only being executed on the first iteration but i'm not sure why
[13:59:27] <Majicpanda> john-dev: still encapsulate it in the document ready function?
[13:59:37] <Kambfhase> ?:contains @ hlveheart
[13:59:37] <Majicpanda> its still not firing for some reason, no errors
[13:59:38] <bot-t> hlveheart, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[13:59:38] <john-dev> Majicpanda, as you like
[14:00:04] <john-dev> hlveheart, you can use $(this) after you found it to addClass
[14:00:08] <Majicpanda> can you use this on input type=submit ?
[14:00:13] <Majicpanda> if it has an id and name
[14:00:17] <hlveheart> Hm!
[14:00:20] <hlveheart> thanks guys.
[14:00:34] <hlveheart> I might stick around just incase I run into any issues ;P
[14:00:51] <Majicpanda> or should i just make my buttons as href links with a class
[14:00:58] <Majicpanda> not sure what jquery plays most friendly with
[14:01:06] <john-dev> any html tag can have an id
[14:01:23] <john-dev> so just give it an id and listen to $(#theid).on('click'..
[14:01:35] <john-dev> $('#theid')..
[14:02:18] <john-dev> Majicpanda, but your version will work too
[14:03:25] <Majicpanda> neither are firing with 	$("#shop_purchase_confirm").on("click", function(event){
[14:03:48] <john-dev> does your button have that id=".."?
[14:04:00] <Mattias> keirlav87: tried a console.log(jobType); under 'hi'?
[14:04:06] <Kambfhase> Majicpanda: do you do ajax?
[14:04:11] <Mattias> keirlav87: might give you a hint ^.^
[14:04:15] <Majicpanda> id="shop_purchase_confirm"
[14:04:27] <Majicpanda> Kambfhase: not in this specific call
[14:04:29] <john-dev> Do you use jquery > 1.7?
[14:04:30] <Majicpanda> wait yes
[14:04:37] <Kambfhase> Majicpanda: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[14:04:41] <Majicpanda> the div content is populated with an ajax call
[14:04:42] <Kambfhase> try that
[14:04:45] <Majicpanda> if thats what you were asking
[14:04:56] <Majicpanda> yes but its minified
[14:05:01] <Majicpanda> that the issue?
[14:05:09] <john-dev> That's no problem
[14:05:10] <Mattias> keirlav87: or just ignore me :P I'm very tired right now :)
[14:05:20] <john-dev> .on is available in jquery 1.7 and aove
[14:05:25] <keirlav87> mattias: i get the full list of each item - type ft ft ft ft ft ft etc :P
[14:05:37] <Majicpanda> yea 1.7.1
[14:05:47] <Majicpanda> min.js
[14:05:51] <john-dev> k, but .on is fine here..
[14:06:15] <Majicpanda> so i make an ajax call to a php file which fills a div .html(data)
[14:06:24] <Majicpanda> and then try to make a call on that input id
[14:06:43] <john-dev> y
[14:07:27] <dangerousdave> hi, can anyone give me a code review please? http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/9243/am-i-using-jquery-correctly-in-my-first-simple-project/9244#9244
[14:07:28] <Majicpanda> hmm.. yea i dont know it should all be ok
[14:07:33] <hlveheart> Hmpfh
[14:07:37] <hlveheart> Still can't seem to get it
[14:07:58] <john-dev> Majicpanda, even if its deprecated, add .live instead of .on just for texting purposes
[14:08:04] <john-dev> testing*
[14:08:09] <Majicpanda> http://pastebin.com/VWSAaPSs
[14:08:17] <LucaS05> there's any bug related to anchor links?
[14:08:19] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me get this updated on a ajax reload? $("form.jqtransform").jqTransform();
[14:08:41] <Majicpanda> live worked fine..
[14:09:08] <LucaS05> cause if i add the class href="#" it gives me the
[14:09:16] <LucaS05> error
[14:09:39] <Kambfhase> ?p @ LucaS05
[14:09:40] <bot-t> LucaS05, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:09:55] <dangerousdave> I know whats wrong if your pee smells of sugar puffs
[14:09:57] <Majicpanda> john-dev: no need to look at that code, .live works.. and definitely minified vs uncompressed doesnt matter?
[14:10:09] <Tomas--> LekeFly: looks. I would just echo the recommendations already posted
[14:10:12] <Majicpanda> not sure why .on fails but .live works
[14:10:17] <Tomas--> LekeFly: looks good that is
[14:10:43] <john-dev> Majicpanda, it doesnt matter..
[14:10:49] <john-dev> Strange :-/
[14:11:04] <Majicpanda> :(
[14:11:06] <LekeFly> Tomas--: huh? : ) .live?
[14:11:10] <rock_star> How can I generate a random number and use it in a fade timer?   this is what I have so far: var s1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 400)); jQuery('#Sparkle1').fadeOut(s1).fadeIn(s1);  and it not working :/
[14:11:37] <Kambfhase> rock_star: you have to use a callback, iirc.
[14:11:48] <Tomas--> LekeFly: sorry I must be replying to the wrong person
[14:11:53] <john-dev> try: $("div").on("click", '#shop_purchase_confirm', function(event){
[14:12:21] <Mattias> keirlav87: http://jsfiddle.net/UQcsv/
[14:12:59] <Mattias> keirlav87: you have to trim whitespace away
[14:14:34] <john-dev> Majicpanda, .on is working different than .live, check out jquery for it's exact syntax..
[14:14:38] <john-dev> try: $("div").on("click", '#shop_purchase_confirm', function(event){
[14:14:44] <Majicpanda> john-dev: that fired it twice
[14:14:55] <john-dev> hehe
[14:14:56] <john-dev> ^^
[14:15:07] <john-dev> let me guess, you have 2 div's?
[14:15:14] <keirlav87> the whitespace between case and the statement?
[14:15:34] <Majicpanda> well its in a ton of divs
[14:15:47] <john-dev> hm ok.. doesn't sound that bad..
[14:15:57] <Majicpanda> <div class='ac'><buttonhere with id></div>
[14:16:07] <Majicpanda> nothing fancy..
[14:16:14] <Majicpanda> input type=submit wrapped in a div
[14:16:16] <keirlav87> no i see what you've done
[14:16:27] <keirlav87> mattias: thank you very much :)
[14:16:33] <hlveheart> Errrh. so this is what I'm trying to do in a nutshell
[14:16:33] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/848KD/13/
[14:16:40] <john-dev> hm, well i don't know the exact way of using .on..
[14:16:54] <john-dev> mabye someone else can help you.. until than, use .live *duck*
[14:17:04] <rock_star> Kambfhase: ok, I see... so assuming this: $(selector).fadeIn(speed,callback)  what would I put in the callback function?
[14:17:32] <Kambfhase> function(){ $(this).fadeIn(s1)}
[14:18:06] <hlveheart> Anyone? ^^
[14:18:07] <keirlav87> mattias: thats been annoying me for like an hour  and a half lol, much appreciated :)
[14:18:07] <hlveheart> :P
[14:18:26] <Mattias> keirlav87: that's about for how long I've known jquery :P
[14:19:10] <khmer> hlveheart: there are a couple of things wrong here
[14:19:29] <khmer> hlveheart: one is that you're not looking in your console for the simple errors :) like that you've terminated your lines with colons instead of semicolons
[14:19:37] <Mattias> Had to use jQuery now for a simple task of re-arranging dom though ^.^
[14:20:25] <keirlav87> mattias: quick learner then :P do you write in anything else?
[14:20:52] <hlveheart> Yeah, I just saw that
[14:20:54] <hlveheart> :S
[14:21:02] <khmer> hlveheart: the second is that your HTML has whitespace around the inner text of your <a> tags, but you aren't trimming your .text() function with $.trim()
[14:21:07] <khmer> hlveheart: third, you're running the same loop three times
[14:21:29] <hlveheart> AH
[14:21:34] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/848KD/22/
[14:21:42] <hlveheart> You are a fucking gorgeous, gorgeous person.
[14:21:44] <Mattias> keirlav87: yeah, I've used a lot of languages, not mastered many but I've learned how to program well. C, C++, haskell, python, ruby, php, C# with asp.net, as3, etc :) haven't done much js though
[14:21:45] <hlveheart> Thank you
[14:21:54] <Mattias> I really love haskell :)
[14:22:09] <khmer> hlveheart: :)
[14:22:15] <Mattias> I wonder if anyone has ever mastered C++ :)
[14:22:17] <hlveheart> Thank you, my eyes are tired, excuse my sloppiness.
[14:22:18] <hlveheart> :P
[14:23:51] <khmer> hlveheart: http://jsfiddle.net/848KD/23/ ;)
[14:24:19] <Dyg> Hello, I'm a jquery newbie and was hoping that someone wouldn't mind helping me with a (hopefully) straight forward question. I have a form on a web page, and the input name for a particular field includes "validate[required]" as part of the class. I've decided that I would no longer like to validate this field, and was wondering what the proper command/syntax would be? For example: "validate[false]" or something along those lines?
[14:24:37] <LukeNukem> hello
[14:24:49] <hlveheart> Ooh.
[14:24:53] <LukeNukem> i have a div with magin-top set to -40px so its above the screen, i want to make it look asif it scrolls down onto the screen
[14:24:57] <LukeNukem> how can i do that?
[14:24:59] <hlveheart> You sir, are a jQuery wizard.
[14:25:05] <hlveheart> how did you do that?
[14:25:14] <ryanneufeld> LukeNukem: see .animate
[14:25:18] <khmer> hlveheart: the text happens to be the same as the classnames
[14:25:20] <ryanneufeld> LukeNukem: ?see .animate
[14:25:30] <LukeNukem> i did
[14:25:33] <ryanneufeld> ?animate
[14:25:34] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:25:37] <LukeNukem> how do i do it in animate
[14:25:42] <hlveheart> Ah, that's a great point
[14:25:48] <LukeNukem> whats the syntax for margin-top?
[14:25:50] <khmer> js> ("  Site   A   ").replace(/\s/g,'')
[14:25:51] <hlveheart> Thank you so much!
[14:25:55] <khmer> hlveheart: np
[14:26:00] <ryanneufeld> LukeNukem: start by reading the docs, and trying stuff
[14:26:05] <khmer> hmm, thought i was in #javascript
[14:26:10] <ryanneufeld> margin-top is the property your changing
[14:26:11] <khmer> `eval ("  Site   A   ").replace(/\s/g,'')
[14:26:16] <khmer> hmmm
[14:26:26] <pflock> can anyone tell me why this code ( http://jsfiddle.net/vMhFY/ ) works in JSFiddle, but on my PC the JQuery function just isn't executed when you click the button? I'm sitting on this problem since yesterday already..
[14:26:26] <khmer> ?eval ("  Site   A   ").replace(/\s/g,'')
[14:26:28] <bot-t> khmer: "SiteA"
[14:27:05] <khmer> pflock: "on your PC"? are you simply opening the web page in your browser, so it's coming from a file:// URL, or are you running a local web host?
[14:27:30] <pflock> khmer: yes, I'm running xampp
[14:27:57] <pflock> khmer: the javascript onload alert is executed as it should but the jquery part just isnt working
[14:28:36] <khmer> pflock: there's no such thing as ../php/poster.php at jsfiddle.com
[14:29:00] <pflock> khmer: yes I know, I just copied the code, that is how I link the file on my pc
[14:29:52] <LukeNukem> ryanneufeld, http://paste.ubuntu.com/851941/
[14:29:52] <pflock> khmer: I know that the function won't work in Jsfiddle, but at least I get the alert when I click on the button. Local I don't get the alert or anything
[14:30:07] <LukeNukem> i cant post on jsfiddle because my net is really slow my brother is downloading and jsfiddle wont load
[14:30:56] <khmer> pflock: any console errors in local?
[14:31:19] <pflock> I don't work in the console
[14:31:34] <pflock> I have the files on the server and just call them in the browser
[14:33:04] <rock_star> i How would I fadein() hold for some time then fadeOut() ?
[14:33:19] <LukeNukem> ryanneufeld, so topBar is hidden
[14:33:24] <LukeNukem> would i need to unhidden it first?
[14:33:39] <kamoricks> I'm attempting to do tabs with jquery-ui. I cribbed most of http://jsfiddle.net/jmmL5/ from the JQueryUI website, but it's not showing the same pretty tabs. Any ideas why?
[14:33:55] <kamoricks> (Yes, UI.Tabs is in my minified download, no, there are no javascript errors, yes, it's loading the scripts.)
[14:34:32] <k1t> could someone push forward an admin sandbox request i just put it? i just wanna see how your active_shipping is configured on 1.0.0
[14:34:36] <k1t> in the admin interface
[14:34:46] <k1t> mine's acting up on 1.0.0 but it clearly works on 1.0.0 lol
[14:34:49] <k1t> =P
[14:34:58] <khmer> pflock: i mean a js console
[14:35:02] <khmer> pflock: chrome inspector or firebug
[14:35:07] <khmer> pflock: open one up and learn to use it
[14:35:39] <nick_h> why does this cause the JavaScript to be executed, despite not being added to the DOM?:  $('<html>').html('<script type="text/javascript">alert("js executed");</script>')
[14:35:55] <pflock> khmer: I have chrome and firebug installed. can you give me a hint to the error log or something? :D
[14:36:11] <khmer> pflock: in the "Console" tab of both firebug and the chrome web inspector!
[14:36:30] <mathi> hi
[14:36:36] <mathi> what does "$.fn." mean?
[14:36:59] <nick_h> mathi: "$.fn" grabs the "fn" property on the "$" object
[14:37:11] <pflock> khmer: Yes, thanks. Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined. That sounds as if he wouldn't recognize the jquery?
[14:37:32] <mathi> and what kind of property is "fn"?
[14:38:00] <khmer> pflock: sounds like jquery isn't coming in correctly!
[14:38:04] <khmer> pflock: make sure it's loaded
[14:38:19] <khmer> mathi: it's an old abbreviation for "function"
[14:38:19] <pflock> khmer: I solved that by putting the link to the jquery before the links to the other scripts
[14:38:41] <pflock> khmer: seems like that worked, don't know why. but I still don't get the allert
[14:39:00] <khmer> mathi: basically the convention is for static jQuery utility functions, like .ajax() or .trim(), to live in the $. namespace
[14:39:09] <mathi> khmer, but why do you need to do something like: "$.fn.myNewPlugin = function() {
[14:39:09] <mathi> ", and not directly $.myNewPlugin ?
[14:39:18] <khmer> mathi: when you put something in the $.fn namespace, it becomes a jquery plugin, a method that is added to every jquery collection
[14:39:18] <mathi> mm
[14:39:31] <k1t> getting undefined method `available_to_order?' for nil:NilClass with a fresh spree install w/ sample data and all i did add spree_active_shipping to gemfile, and setup a shipping method
[14:39:38] <khmer> mathi: $.myPlugin will not result in $('selector').myPlugin becoming available
[14:39:42] <khmer> mathi: $.fn.myPlugin will
[14:39:57] <nick_h> mathi: doing $.myNewPlugin will polluate jQuery's properties. making it $.fn.myNewPlugin ensures that all plugins are located in $.fn , and aren't mixed up with jQuery's other properties
[14:40:01] <khmer> k1t: you're not in #ruby
[14:40:17] <k1t> and i know my info is right since i have this -all- working on 4 0.11 install
[14:40:27] <k1t> khmer: wow
[14:40:31] <pflock> khmer: Now I have no errors and it still doesn't work :D
[14:40:33] <k1t> sorry bout that guys!
[14:40:40] <khmer> np :)
[14:40:41] * k1t smh
[14:40:45] <k1t> lol
[14:41:14] <mathi> khmer, but you said it's for static jquery utility functions. Though $.ajax or $.trim don't work with $('selector')....
[14:41:57] <khmer> mathi: i wasn't clear, sorry
[14:41:59] <mathi> then you say that it has to be written like this for it to work for $('selector')....
[14:42:18] <khmer> mathi: $.someFunction is for static methods that don't work on a jquery instance
[14:42:28] <khmer> mathi: $.fn.someFunction is for plugin methods that should be available on every jquery instance
[14:42:40] <khmer> mathi: it's generally not recommended to add more static methods to jquery
[14:42:49] <khmer> mathi: they call it "polluting the namespace" and they're right, basically
[14:42:51] <mathi> jquery instance, is jquery elements that you get through a selector like $('selector') ?
[14:43:01] <khmer> mathi: exactly. a "jquery object".
[14:43:49] <kamoricks> So anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/jmmL5/1/ doesn't display my tabs like it should? Is jquery not able to grab the CSS somehow? This is copied straight from the documentation.
[14:44:43] <pifantastic> kamoricks: yes, you are referencing a css file
[14:44:47] <pifantastic> that does not exist
[14:44:49] <mathi> khmer, is it just something I should know by heart, or is there a good reason why the function has to be preceeded by fn. for them to work with jquery instances?
[14:45:11] <kamoricks> pifantastic: Okay, but the documentation says that JQuery applies the CSS elements to the tabs itself. Shouldn't it display the default theme, then?
[14:45:33] <pifantastic> kamoricks: not without the base css
[14:45:45] <pifantastic> kamoricks: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[14:45:51] <pifantastic> add that as a resource in your fiddle ^
[14:46:19] <pifantastic> http://jsfiddle.net/5YGyt/1/
[14:46:22] <khmer> mathi: well, there's a good reason why to do it, because that's how jquery knows which methods to make available!
[14:46:24] <pifantastic> kamoricks: ^
[14:46:31] <el_toledo> hi, i try to append a button to a specific div. what do i wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/fK7ue/
[14:46:34] <khmer> mathi: jquery uses the .fn property as a prototype for jquery objects
[14:46:47] <kamoricks> pifantastic: Ah. That fixes it, thanks.
[14:47:09] <coldhead> cheers!
[14:47:13] <nick_h> hey guys. why does this cause the JavaScript to be executed, despite not being added to the DOM?:  $('<html>').html('<script type="text/javascript">alert("js executed");</script>')
[14:47:13] <pifantastic> khmer: http://jsfiddle.net/9fsF4/1/
[14:47:28] <chee> coldhead: >:Â±
[14:47:34] <pifantastic> nick_h: because it does get added to the DOM
[14:47:43] <khmer> pifantastic: hi
[14:48:52] <nick_h> pifantastic: how is that being added to the DOM? there's no call to insert(), append(), etc
[14:49:08] <pifantastic> nick_h: that's what html() does
[14:49:20] <mathi> khmer, so .fn is an object that contains methods for jQuery?
[14:49:40] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to js/jquery and wonder if there is a way to check when $(window).scroll ends? is there a callback? or an event? id like to ad a specific class to my sections when the users scrolls there. maybe someone has a hint for me :) thx in advance
[14:50:07] <pifantastic> nick_h: when you call hmtl() with an HTML string, jquery does this: this.empty().append( value );
[14:50:14] <pifantastic> html()*
[14:51:35] <nick_h> pifantastic: ah, i see. but if "this" hasn't been added to the DOM yet, then i would think that "value" isn't actually added to the DOM, either
[14:51:59] <pifantastic> nick_h: the html element has definitely been added to the DOM
[14:52:04] <el_toledo> can anyone say me how i can append a button to a div? http://jsfiddle.net/fK7ue/
[14:52:10] <khmer> pifantastic: but explain to him where on the tree it's appended
[14:52:17] <khmer> pifantastic: ;)
[14:52:36] <khmer> that <html> tag...where in the document is it being appended!?
[14:52:54] <pifantastic> ?
[14:53:06] <pifantastic> if you don't have an HTML tag the browswer is going to create one for you
[14:53:43] <khmer> pifantastic: if i'm in a document that already has an html tag, and i go $('<html>'), what do i have
[14:54:07] <khmer> pifantastic: how is it different from, say, $('html')
[14:54:11] <yamahaalex37> im not able to call this function later at all
[14:54:13] <yamahaalex37> jQuery(document).ready(function booboo(){
[14:54:14] <pifantastic> ohhh
[14:54:15] <nick_h> pifantastic: right, but i'm not selecting the HTML tag. i'm building a new one: $('<html>') vs $('html')
[14:54:19] <pifantastic> I didnt notice the brackets!
[14:54:27] <yamahaalex37> trying to call it with $booboo();
[14:54:28] <khmer> pifantastic: i didn't notice your face
[14:54:32] <pifantastic> nick_h: jQuery is going to create a documentFragment in that case
[14:54:52] <nick_h> pifantastic: that document fragment isn't in the DOM, though, right?
[14:54:53] <khmer> yamahaalex37: your named function expression does not register its name in the global context, since it's being argued as an expression and not a declaration
[14:55:02] <khmer> yamahaalex37: you'll be able to call booboo inside itself, but not outside itself
[14:55:12] <yamahaalex37> khmer, how could i do it outside/
[14:55:27] <khmer> yamahaalex37: declare function booboo above the jQuery(document).ready()
[14:55:28] <pifantastic> nick_h: You will find that things don't have to be in the DOM for their resources to be fetched. For instance, create a new Image() and set the src
[14:55:44] <pifantastic> you will see that your browser will fetch the image, even if you dont add it to the dom
[14:55:46] <yamahaalex37> function booboo = jQuery(document.ready(function(){ etc ?
[14:55:49] <nick_h> pifantastic: hmmm
[14:55:51] <khmer> yamahaalex37: ...no
[14:56:01] <yamahaalex37> oh i see what you mean
[14:56:11] <khmer> yamahaalex37: function booboo() { }; jQuery(document).ready(booboo);
[14:56:25] <nick_h> pifantastic: thanks for explaining how this all fits together. i understand why the JS is executed now, though i don't agree that it should be executed until it's added to the DOM
[14:57:58] <pifantastic> nick_h: then don't set the src until you're ready
[14:58:12] <Orphis> Hi ! I've loaded a XML document with jQuery and I'd like to walk through the DOM
[14:58:28] <yamahaalex37> khmer, if i wanted it to be a jquery specific function
[14:58:34] <yamahaalex37> would it be function$booboo()
[14:58:35] <Orphis> But it seems that XPath isn't supported (NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: DOM Exception 9)
[14:58:39] <yamahaalex37> function $booboo
[14:58:58] <Orphis> So instead I used getElementsByTagName and it returns me the node that I want
[14:59:01] <pifantastic> Orphis: right, jQuery does not xupport XPath
[14:59:09] <nick_h> pifantastic: if only the problem was as easy as that  =P  i'm using jquery-pjax to load a portion of a page, but am finding that JavaScript that shouldn't be executed, is being executed
[14:59:11] <khmer> yamahaalex37: that convention isn't really used for functions, but for jquery objects
[14:59:15] <nick_h> bbiab
[14:59:24] <Orphis> But then at some point, I'd like to get the text node and I can't find any way to do it
[14:59:42] <pifantastic> ?p @ Orphis
[14:59:42] <bot-t> Orphis, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:59:53] <yamahaalex37> khmer, ok, im having trouble calling my function
[14:59:57] <pifantastic> Orphis: $(some_xml_string).find('sometag').text()
[14:59:58] <yamahaalex37> i dont want it to be in a document ready
[15:00:02] <Orphis> pifantastic: It's ok, jQuery is returning me a Document object
[15:00:03] <khmer> yamahaalex37: jsfiddle it!~
[15:00:06] <yamahaalex37> i just want it to be in a line of code,
[15:00:08] <yamahaalex37> its just one line i need
[15:00:08] <Orphis> And that is working just fine
[15:00:11] <yamahaalex37> functionname();
[15:00:15] <yamahaalex37> should that call it?
[15:00:24] <pifantastic> Orphis: right, but you can easily use jquery to traverse the document
[15:00:43] <Orphis> pifantastic: what functions ?
[15:00:54] <pifantastic> ?g jquery traversal
[15:00:56] <bot-t> pifantastic, Tree Traversal – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[15:01:14] <yamahaalex37> khmer, your example was jQuery(document).ready(booboo);
[15:01:21] <yamahaalex37> what if i just want to call booboo anywhere
[15:01:29] <khmer> yamahaalex37: then you call it like a function
[15:01:29] <yamahaalex37> booboo();
[15:01:35] <khmer> yes
[15:01:45] <khmer> if that doesn't work, then you have a scope problem
[15:01:45] <Orphis> Oh, sorry textContent
[15:01:49] <khmer> and you need to show us some code context
[15:01:51] <Orphis> Not text()
[15:01:51] <yamahaalex37> its not working... maybe because my function is inline html
[15:01:54] <khmer> that's what jsfiddle is for
[15:02:05] <yamahaalex37> its pretty long program, im not sure i could do it in jsfiddle
[15:02:11] <yamahaalex37> ill try
[15:04:09] <Orphis> pifantastic: The API looks fine, but how can I use it with the "Document" that jQuery returns to me ? $.get("someurl.xml", function (data) { ... }, "xml");
[15:04:45] <pifantastic> $.get("someurl.xml", function (data) { $(data).find('sometag').text() }, "xml");
[15:05:00] <Orphis> Ah $(data), right
[15:05:25] <Orphis> So obvious that I couldn't find it with my bad headache
[15:06:14] <Orphis> pifantastic: Thanks a lot !
[15:07:26] <rock_star> Hey I got the starfader to work! and I just added random delays. check out the results: http://sb.opensitebuilder.com/
[15:08:23] <markmarkoh> rock_star
[15:10:43] <someprimetime> hey i want to know if it's possible to remove a specific file from being uploaded when using .files so I can allow a user to manually remove a file from being uploaded (before they upload)
[15:11:18] <someprimetime> I know it's readonly, and one way is to just set the value of the input file field to nothing e.g. $('input[type=file]').val(''); but say i want to just remove one of them?
[15:11:20] <someprimetime> possible?
[15:11:47] <pflock> can anyone tell me why this http://jsfiddle.net/BwaNJ/ works in jsfiddle but with the same construction I don't get an alert on my local webserver?
[15:12:48] <someprimetime> pflock: did you include jquery?
[15:12:53] <markmarkoh> pflock - jsfiddle loads things in order, your webserver probably isn't loading things in the right order
[15:13:01] <someprimetime> make sure to wrap it in $(function() {});
[15:13:03] <markmarkoh> or you are binding the click to an element not yet in the DOM
[15:13:05] <pflock> someprimetime: yes of course
[15:13:05] <WebDragon> rock_star: nice job :)
[15:13:47] <pflock> markmarkoh: how can I prevent JS from binding it to the element before it is in the DOM?
[15:14:03] <someprimetime> pflock: does this work: http://jsfiddle.net/BwaNJ/1/ ?
[15:14:09] <pflock> markmarkoh: and what is the right order?
[15:14:13] <markmarkoh> pflock, wrap it in $() like someprimetime mentioned
[15:15:38] <pflock> markmarkoh: no, still isnt working. Is $() the same thing as document.ready?
[15:15:59] <pflock> someprimetime: no, that isn't working
[15:16:28] <someprimetime> what other code do you have on the page>
[15:16:33] <markmarkoh> pflock, yeah, same as document.ready. is it possible this script tag is above jquery's script tag?
[15:17:40] <pflock> markmarkoh: no, JQuery is first and this document is last
[15:19:27] <hlveheart> kk, last question before I get out of here.
[15:19:34] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/848KD/102/
[15:19:55] <pflock> I'm already having this problem since yesterday, I even opened two new files and copied only parts of the code, but I can't find what isn't working and why it is working in jsfiddle
[15:20:53] <hlveheart> i don't know the best way in getting it to add a class to the 3rd item based upon its' href
[15:20:56] <keirlav87> thanks for your help guys, off now, cheers!
[15:22:43] <hlveheart> ^^? Anyone?
[15:22:54] <someprimetime> ? attr() @ hlveheart
[15:22:55] <bot-t> hlveheart, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[15:22:55] <testox> subway rocks
[15:23:15] <pflock> I just found the error. I had some weird whitespace sign in the last line of the JS element, and that seems just to shut down the whole thing..
[15:23:28] <hlveheart> Hmmfh
[15:23:32] <hlveheart> One sec :)
[15:23:33] <hlveheart> Thanks
[15:23:51] <someprimetime> check to see if the attr('href') == 'domain.com'
[15:23:57] <someprimetime> if it does, addClass()
[15:27:28] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/848KD/108/ I'm missing something I think
[15:27:29] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/848KD/108/
[15:27:38] <hlveheart> Erm, sorry for the double paste. long day
[15:27:38] <hlveheart> lol
[15:27:45] <someprimetime> hlveheart: why are you looping that many times?
[15:27:52] <someprimetime> why don't you just have one .each()
[15:28:08] <hlveheart> becasue they're an example, they don't reflect the actual id's and whatnot on the site itself
[15:28:19] <rock_star> Ok, lets say I want to change the position of a div... whats the best technique to change its position?
[15:28:33] <pflock>  
[15:28:36] <someprimetime> rock_star: .css('position', '');
[15:28:41] <someprimetime> absolute, relative, fixed
[15:28:43] <someprimetime> pick one
[15:29:03] <hlveheart> but yeah, lol. that's why i looped it so many times.
[15:29:22] <hlveheart> The actual site has obscure ID names and whatnot, so this is merely to teach myself
[15:29:32] <rock_star> I see.. ok, that rhymes with what I looked up.. thx for the confirmation
[15:30:44] <hlveheart> anything standing out to you in that last jfiddle other then the excessive looping?
[15:30:45] <hlveheart> =x
[15:30:58] <someprimetime> hlveheart: you are comparing the href value to the src value of the image
[15:31:01] <someprimetime> you know that right?
[15:31:15] <hlveheart> AH jesus
[15:31:34] <hlveheart> I went back too many times, because I was originally trying to target the src of the image, but with no luck.
[15:31:48] <someprimetime> you can just use attr('src')
[15:32:39] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to js/jquery and wonder if there is a way to check when $(window).scroll ends? is there a callback? or an event? id like to ad a specific class to my sections when the users scrolls there. maybe someone has a hint for me  thx in advance

[15:36:18] <someprimetime> .text() @ zduffy

[15:48:31] <art341> is it possible to scroll the content of a div inside jquery ui tab?
[15:48:57] <kkuno> hi
[15:48:58] <kkuno> I need some hints on ajax+pushstate. I want to use cleaner urls, instead of the classic    /#page   for changing page with ajax, like /page/par1/par2
[15:48:58] <kkuno> I tried to use url rewriting, so   /page ---> /#page
[15:48:58] <kkuno> but the browser is forced to refresh the page every time... how can I avoid this?
[15:49:45] <kkuno> while sites like google+ don't refresh
[15:49:58] <kkuno> I mean if I write the link directly in the url bar
[15:50:48] <kkuno> mmmh
[15:51:19] <kkuno> maybe rewrite to ---> javascript:...
[15:51:24] <kkuno> is it correct?
[15:52:38] <mathi> what is the difference between a "stateless" plugin and "stateful" plugin?
[15:59:58] <bobsomebody> is there an easy way to adjust the default animation behavior used in show(),hide(),toggle() [and others im sure] id just like to remove the left: -=0 part (or whatever is actually going on there just pseudo code to help understand the aspect id like to change)
[16:00:53] <bobsomebody> the element in question does not have height set so replicating the behavior as desired is eluding me
[16:02:02] <bobsomebody> i do have a working model if that helps. That about covers it, ill stfu now and cross my fingers lol
[16:03:11] <solidus-river> my complete function is getting called before the animation is complete
[16:03:14] <solidus-river> why would this happen?
[16:04:10] <ancanta> hm somewhere in the code i guess there is a hover that destroys what i do. How do i disable hover ?
[16:05:18] <danieliser> doing a hover on nested lists.. how can i stop the effects from bubbling up to the parent li when i hover over an li inside another?
[16:05:54] <bobsomebody> solidus-river, because thats how jquery behaves, if its .animate() double check the docs on calling things after animation is done, its not always perfect, a sloppy solution if all else fails is to use setTimeout on an anonymous function
[16:06:29] <bobsomebody> and wrap your events to trigger after the same number of ms as the animation
[16:06:55] <solidus-river> bobsomebody: ah, so if my duration is 500 i should delat 520ms and run a function?
[16:07:30] <bobsomebody> no i think you add another argument to it but the next argument would be a function
[16:07:40] <bobsomebody> double check animate help page, its in the example code
[16:07:48] <bobsomebody> the second or third block i want to say
[16:09:02] <bobsomebody> danieliser, got code?
[16:09:26] <bobsomebody> (the js + the UL LI snip would help, or a link)
[16:10:35] <solidus-river> bobsomebody: yeah i'm doing it right but it gets called early (selector).animate({ hash of stuff to animate }, 500, funciton_to_call_when_done);
[16:10:44] <solidus-river> calls the function right after the animation kicks off, not when it is done
[16:11:34] <crankharder> where do I bind keypress events (left/right arrow) if I want them to be active regardless of where the mouse is?
[16:12:18] <bobsomebody> solidus-river, i had this issue recently also, if you do (pseduo code here->) settimeout(function(){/*jquery here*/}, 520);
[16:12:25] <danieliser> bobsomebody: got it working.. attatched it to the comment body rather than the comment container
[16:12:27] <bobsomebody> it should work
[16:15:08] <bobsomebody> danieliser, i do stuff like that all the time, the one i love is when you forget its an ID not a class...
[16:15:51] <zulax> i am using accordian, and it works fine until i have just 1 level of menu
[16:16:15] <zulax> if i make 2 level menu then after the first expansion, when i try to expand the child, it collapses to parent
[16:16:46] <solidus-river> bobsomebody: wow, set timeout is returning immediately no matter what, what is this
[16:16:58] <solidus-river> setTimeout(console.log('DAMNIT'), 5000);
[16:17:02] <solidus-river> returns damnit immediately
[16:18:34] <kurol> try setTimeout("console.log('DAMNIT')", 5000);
[16:18:57] <bobsomebody> put something like.... setTimeout( function() { alert('Damnit, i should 5 seconds late'); }, 5000);
[16:19:37] <bobsomebody> string wont pass jquery right afaik, anonymous function wrappers are the way to go from what i gathered on google a 3am wtf'ing my code
[16:20:00] <bobsomebody> *at 3am
[16:20:15] <solidus-river> haha! well, that shows me, i was giving code not a function
[16:21:02] <kkuno> is there a way to avoid loading a page typed in the url bar?
[16:22:15] <bobsomebody> kkuno, that sounds like a rather frustrating feature to add
[16:22:18] <danieliser> any way to combine slideUp and fadeOut?
[16:23:06] <kkuno> bobsomebody, i'm trying to understand why sites like google+  don't refresh the page if a url is typed in the url bar
[16:23:16] <kkuno> I can't replicate that behaviour
[16:23:22] <solidus-river> kkuno: thats a browser thing not a page thing
[16:24:02] <solidus-river> you can opt in for quick load in chrome
[16:24:15] <solidus-river> where once you type a url as you type it it will google what youve typed and start loading that page
[16:24:25] <bobsomebody> danieliser, slideToggle is a step in the right direction
[16:24:43] <solidus-river> kkuno: what behavior? are you talking about the google+ search bar or the actual browser url bar?
[16:25:31] <kkuno> no
[16:25:41] <bobsomebody> id just wget all the **** js files and grep away for the right keywords
[16:25:55] <kkuno> solidus-river, if you are inside google+, and you type a g+ url in the bar the page won't refresh
[16:26:09] <kkuno> but it seems to be loaded with ajax maybe
[16:26:48] <kkuno> and it's not a classic hashtag url (like    /#page)
[16:27:01] <kkuno> but a standard   url
[16:27:52] <bobsomebody> but to out right disable typing in the address bar or at least loading whats typed....
[16:28:09] <bobsomebody> that worries me a little if it is actually code lol
[16:28:20] <bobsomebody> last thing i want is spam sites "trapping" my tabs...
[16:29:23] <z0n3d> what's the best way to remove an item from an array if you know the index?
[16:29:28] <z0n3d> array.removeAt(6);
[16:30:40] <ancanta> so there isnt a way to disable mouseover for some specific boxes ?
[16:31:49] <kkuno> solidus-river, mmh actually, if I disable the cache, the page is refreshed
[16:32:23] <kkuno> so the cache is so fast that it seems an ajax loading
[16:33:14] <kkuno> ok, solved ^^
[16:34:35] <danieliser> bobsomebody: i mean simultaneously.. i want it to slide up while fading out
[16:35:40] <danieliser> i guess animate the opacity and height
[16:39:49] <nonotza> could someone tell me why this regex is not returning a match? http://pastebin.com/mjidU0zh

[16:43:46] <aaronmcadam> what was it
[17:02:24] <cybersholt> anybody here know of a site preferably that will scan and count the number of pages for a given domain???
[17:05:30] <someprimetime> cybersholt: i'd say google is your best bet
[17:05:37] <someprimetime> google.com search "site:domain.com"
[17:05:52] <cybersholt> yea but it's showing duplicate content
[17:06:10] <cybersholt> thanks tho

[17:17:50] <intellilogic>  if(pData.match(/\[.*[:,].*\]/gi)){   ///Error: pData.match is not a function
[17:21:44] <Majicpanda> anyone know why $("#shop_purchase_confirm").live("click", function(){ would work but not .on with the same parameters?
[17:21:51] <Majicpanda> jquery 1.7.1
[17:22:58] <Eviltwin> Because that's not how .on works?
[17:23:09] <Majicpanda> well i was just going off what someone was trying to say earlier
[17:23:12] <Majicpanda> what is it now?
[17:23:21] <Eviltwin> It uses delegate-style syntax
[17:23:26] <Eviltwin> With a slightly different order
[17:23:50] <Eviltwin> $("selector").live("event", function() { ... }) can be done as $(document).on("event", "selector", function() { ... })
[17:24:10] <Majicpanda> ah just document? yea i didnt understand the $() part
[17:25:40] <Majicpanda> what is the purpose of $(document)?
[17:25:44] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to see if number of #idname is > 1
[17:25:47] <Majicpanda> or what would be another example.. not understanding it
[17:25:53] <yamahaalex37> if #id exists more than once?
[17:26:00] <Eviltwin> Majicpanda: Because that's what the event listener actually gets bound to
[17:26:03] <Eviltwin> Just like in .live
[17:26:06] <Eviltwin> Except .live doesn't show it
[17:26:24] <Eviltwin> The purpose is to make the event delegation syntax clearer
[17:27:42] <yamahaalex37> hey hple, im having a problem
[17:27:42] <joikus> what jquery uploader would you guys recommend
[17:28:00] <yamahaalex37> on a xml module parameter, if checked="1", it is checked
[17:28:04] <yamahaalex37> hoever, then you cant uncheck it
[17:28:12] <yamahaalex37> if you uncheck, save, its still checked after refresh
[17:28:32] <yamahaalex37> sorry
[17:28:34] <yamahaalex37> wrong channel
[17:28:37] <Majicpanda> yamahaalex37: var count=0; $("#idame").each(function() { count++ }); and alert it or whatever? i guess is your question?

[18:04:34] <chovy> how do i get position of an element (it's offset() ) relative to it's parent.

[18:34:01] <[Renegade]> anyone able to help me out with simpleModal plugin? im looking to use the demo on it and run it on page load. http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/
[18:35:25] <[Renegade]> anyone? :(
[18:37:35] <Es0teric> how do i change an element and rever it back after hover?
[18:40:08] <amalvagomes> Callbacks
[18:42:06] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: You could bind to the mouseenter event and then to the mouseexit
[18:42:46] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, so i catch it in a var on mouseenter, then use that var on mouseout?
[18:43:02] <amalvagomes> Why not just bind to the same element twice?
[18:43:31] <amalvagomes> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[18:43:46] <amalvagomes> Check this out.  You pass in one function for the entry and then another for the exit
[18:43:53] <amalvagomes> This way you can change things, and then reset them.
[18:44:01] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, right now i caught it to a placeholder element and on mouseout when i checked it in console.log, its the changed element without reset
[18:44:37] <amalvagomes> Look at that link I sent you.  I think it may become your friend.
[18:45:03] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i checked that.. i know how the functions work but the logic escapes me
[18:45:11] <amalvagomes> What are you aiming to do?
[18:46:17] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i already have a <p> tag that has an element in it.. so when an image is hovered, i want it to change to the text i tell it to.. but i want to find a certain text IN the <p> tag (which i know how to do) my problem is that on hover it changes the element, but on mouseout i dont know how to reset it
[18:47:31] <amalvagomes> Oh, try cacheing the old state of the element in a global variable and then replacing the new stuff with the global from before the hover.
[18:47:56] <dyjytyl> if there's a <p> element and it has nested within it an <a> tag, what would the jquery look like to wrap a <div class="wrapper"> around the <p> and it's child <a>? end result: <div class="wrapper"> <p>hello</p> <a href="#">link</a> </div>
[18:48:22] <dyjytyl> i figured something like $("p > a").wrap("<div class='wrapper'>"); but that's only wrapping the <p> tags in the div
[18:50:45] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i get this -> Uncaught Error: HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: DOM Exception 3 when i put the original state out of the hover function..
[18:51:03] <amalvagomes> Can you paste bin the code?
[18:52:39] <Es0teric> yeah sure, amalvagomes.. give me a minute
[18:56:16] <Es0teric> amalvagomes -> http://pastebin.com/83ByVPYH
[18:56:38] <aqeel> hi room
[18:58:32] <aqeel> if i have class .abc {display:none}...........and js $(this).removeClass("abc");....will this display block do i have to explicitly specify it.......$(this).removeClass("abc").css("display","block");
[19:01:21] <Eviltwin> aqeel: If it has display: none only because of the class "abc" and you remove that class, then it will no longer display block
[19:01:30] <Eviltwin> Unless you set it through some other means
[19:02:10] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: http://pastebin.com/d3QFRm2s
[19:02:13] <amalvagomes> How about that?
[19:03:00] <wiel> on a particular page i submitted a form.the page takes me to a page where it tells me to "please wait" then takes me to a completely different page.how do i handle waiting and getting to the completely different page?
[19:03:09] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i dont see what you did..
[19:04:28] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: look at lines 24 and 37
[19:04:36] <amalvagomes> Does it work?
[19:06:33] <aqeel> thanks
[19:07:13] <aqeel> no wonder my code was not working as wanted...though no visible error was there
[19:08:07] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, no its not working...
[19:08:34] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: What does it give you?
[19:08:38] <amalvagomes> Can you firebug it?
[19:09:22] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i have the js console running on chrome
[19:09:50] <Es0teric> on the mouseout, i do a log on placeholder, it shows me the reset element
[19:10:28] <Es0teric> but when its mixed with unavailable.html(placeholder); it stays the same.. it doesnt change the element, amalvagomes
[19:11:08] <aqeel> i have all links by default set to hidden via css....and when i hover over it must display its sub contents else hide it.....when clicked must show the sub contents......well hover was working fine but when clicked....it seems nothing was happening
[19:13:56] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: http://pastebin.com/nXKmRCt3
[19:14:12] <amalvagomes> What is the function of the evnt_wrp anyways?
[19:15:02] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, its the parent divâ€¦ so when the parent div has mouseout, it reverts back to the original content
[19:15:46] <amalvagomes> Then why not make the hover call on the parent div and then select for its children to edit them?
[19:16:28] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, because i dont want it that wayâ€¦ i want it so when the image thats in the parent div to hover to change the <p> tags
[19:16:39] <Es0teric> *thats hovered
[19:17:08] <amalvagomes> So you want the image to be for the hover in event and the message to go away on the hover out of the parent div?
[19:17:23] <Es0teric> yes, amalvagomes
[19:18:02] <amalvagomes> OHHHH, I see.  Let me look at the code now that I understand it.
[19:18:56] <Es0teric> alright, amalvagomes
[19:22:24] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: Your issue is definitely related to scope.
[19:22:55] <Es0teric> amalvagomes lol.. yeah i know.. i am not used to the scope in js - i have been coding in php too much man
[19:22:57] <amalvagomes> When you are in the hover in function, you declare your variable placeholder.  It gets assigned there but is null later when the hover out is called due to scoping.
[19:23:17] <amalvagomes> I think you should declare placeholder on the global scope.
[19:23:24] <amalvagomes> var placeholder
[19:23:26] <amalvagomes> ;
[19:23:32] <amalvagomes> Then just use it later in those functions.
[19:23:50] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, placeholder is in the same scope as unavailable
[19:23:59] <Es0teric> ontop of the hover function
[19:24:34] <amalvagomes> Yeah, I don't think that they evaluate out in the other scope.  Try logging them from the hover out.  This will help us determine if the hover out is being called at all anyways.
[19:24:43] <amalvagomes> Let me know what it tells you.
[19:25:38] <Es0teric> well, amalvagomes - it seems that initially, the placeholder var is the reset elementâ€¦ but then it changes back to edit event
[19:30:41] <amalvagomes> Es0teric: AHAH!  It appears that javascript fires the mounseenter event while you're still in it.
[19:30:48] <amalvagomes> We should make a fired flag.
[19:31:42] <Es0teric> yeah, amalvagomes.. it happens on mouseout though
[19:31:56] <amalvagomes> It changed after you fired the first one, I think.
[19:32:08] <amalvagomes> You fire the mouse enter, it captures and changes it.
[19:32:22] <Es0teric> i see
[19:32:25] <amalvagomes> Then, while you're still on the element, the mouse enter gets fired again, and captures the current information.
[19:32:40] <Es0teric> oh ok
[19:32:43] <amalvagomes> It "changes" it, but puts the same thing back in.
[19:33:00] <amalvagomes> Then, you leave and you "reset" it back to the thing it got changed to.
[19:33:39] <Es0teric> so then i should doâ€¦ if(placeholder == unavailable) { //something here } else { reset element } ?
[19:34:33] <amalvagomes> Ehâ€¦ maybe something like declare a boolean variable with it and flip it to true in the hover in function only if it is false.  Then, on the hover out, set it to false.
[19:35:13] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, what?
[19:35:14] <Es0teric> lol
[19:35:48] <amalvagomes> http://pastebin.com/ympGjE0Q
[19:35:51] <amalvagomes> Check this out.
[19:35:56] <amalvagomes> Something similar to that.
[19:38:36] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, the mouseout for the parent element, i just do evnt_wrap.each() ?
[19:40:00] <Es0teric> and amalvagomes its still doing the same thing
[19:40:23] <amalvagomes> I guess?
[19:40:38] <amalvagomes> Damn!  We need to know how much these guys get called.
[19:40:43] <amalvagomes> I think it has to do with that.
[19:40:55] <Es0teric> well i passed it once
[19:40:57] <Es0teric> it said 56
[19:41:01] <amalvagomes> Can you like append an "a" to the diagram each time?
[19:41:12] <amalvagomes> See if it gets reset more times than you enter.
[19:41:21] <Es0teric> actually
[19:41:48] <Es0teric> 8Nova Ranoff is <b>Unavailable</b> today.			184wschedule2.php:254Edit event for <b>Unavailable</b>
[19:42:09] <Es0teric> you see, amalvagomes - the first one just get 8 and the second one always increases...
[19:42:22] <Es0teric> everytime i hover over the image
[19:43:20] <amalvagomes> Damnâ€¦ so it is getting called more times than the hover out is.
[19:43:34] <amalvagomes> That's what I was trying to stop with the flag.
[19:43:40] <amalvagomes> Maybe try moving the flag to the global scope?
[19:44:26] <Es0teric> amalvagomes - global as in.. above assignment right?
[19:45:01] <amalvagomes> Yeah, I think that will do.
[19:45:10] <Es0teric> amalvagomes i did that, it still does the same
[19:46:23] <amalvagomes> Hmmmmâ€¦ do you have any ideas as to what might fix this?
[19:46:31] <amalvagomes> I'm stumped too.
[19:48:15] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, noneâ€¦ lol
[19:48:21] <Es0teric> if it was PHP, i would have a better idea
[19:48:54] <amalvagomes> Hmmmâ€¦ well, I think we've at least identified the problemâ€¦ but I'm afraid I can't help you any further.
[19:49:13] <Es0teric> its alright amalvagomes.. thanks though
[19:52:03] <_zoggy_> for the autocomplete jquery ui widget, can i change the keyword of the passed data from 'term' to something else?
[19:53:35] <Es0teric> _zoggy_, is whitney houston dead?
[19:55:42] <_zoggy_> i heard she died a long time ago
[19:55:49] <_zoggy_> but now its offical yes
[19:57:19] <Es0teric> _zoggy_ then thats probably the answer you wanted for your problem lol
[19:59:59] <_zoggy_> so helpful you are
[20:00:17] <_zoggy_> for the autocomplete jquery ui widget, how can i change the keyword from 'term' to something else?
[20:11:45] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i figured it outâ€¦ i had to put placeholder above the hover method because the hover method changes it no matter what
[20:12:08] <amalvagomes> Excellent.  I thought it was scope related.
[20:12:59] <Es0teric> man, the hard part is for me to alternate between php syntax and jquery syntax
[20:14:47] <deeprogram> hi ?
[20:14:56] <deeprogram> I create dom with query and then bind click event on it
[20:15:24] <deeprogram> but click handler can not be triggered
[20:15:34] <deeprogram> I appended this dom on body
[20:16:39] <deeprogram> do you have any idea ?
[20:17:26] <Es0teric> amalvagomes, i have another problem nowâ€¦ the hover out is working for the hover in item, not the parent item i specified
[20:18:00] <Vaerros> deeprogram: link or test case?
[20:18:28] <amalvagomes> Oh, if you want that, you should make the hoverout function of the call you are making do nothing and take the code from it, binding it to the parent element's hoverout.
[20:19:47] <Es0teric> how do i bind it to the parent element though..
[20:23:12] <Es0teric> nvm
[20:30:12] <inpho> i;m trying to do a simple jquery+ajax request, I can get it to call the function no problem
[20:30:19] <inpho> but what am i supposed to pass back or whatever
[20:30:25] <inpho> to indicate a success or error ??
[20:30:37] <inpho> ive tried everythign i can think of
[20:39:36] <inpho> here is a basic example
[20:39:38] <inpho> http://jsfiddle.net/SNA6X/
[20:39:47] <inpho> do i just totally misunderstand ?
[21:10:16] <aqeel> well this jquery chain is really something......if i switch the position of hover() and click()...gives totally different results......y? $("#ID).click().hover(); and  $("#ID).hover().click();
[21:11:26] <aqeel> what is the best practice of placing these commands in chaining....
[21:13:31] <Es0teric> you know.. the one thing i dont like about js now is the fact that it doesnt let me use variables OUTSIDE the scope
[21:14:58] <coldhead> so just global all the things
[21:17:17] <tw2113> isn't that a security thing?
[21:21:53] <aqeel> well if i want to apply both situations and conditions regarding hover and click.....which must i put before....hover or click....
[21:22:04] <nickelnick> yea why not global
[21:22:43] <aqeel> logically should be hover followed by click....but then hoverout negates click events...
[21:28:55] <Es0teric> wtf...
[21:32:08] <Es0teric> i have an array, i want to loop through the array and apply the value to the variable given.. and the same variable is being used in two different places.. how do i get that variable to work outside the scope of the $.each()?
[21:32:37] <Cork> Es0teric: define it before you call each
[21:32:57] <Cork> var my_var; $.each(function() { my_var = something; }); my_var
[21:33:19] <Es0teric> Cork, i did that
[21:33:25] <Es0teric> and it tells me its undefined
[21:33:43] <Cork> Es0teric: you have a fiddle?
[21:34:26] <Es0teric> no, cork
[21:35:23] <Es0teric> Cork, i know what this is doing now thoughâ€¦ the $.each() is looping inside but on the outside, its only applying one
[21:35:41] <Cork> uh
[21:35:44] <tw2113> are you concatenating?
[21:35:50] <tw2113> stuffing into an array?
[21:36:08] <Es0teric> yes, tw2113
[21:36:13] <Cork> Es0teric: we really need to see the code to be able to telly why its not working
[21:36:42] <Es0teric> cork, i'll pastebin but not fiddle

[21:42:53] * tw2113 boogies
[21:43:09] <Es0teric> so what my $.each() method is doing is logging the last item in the array and feeding it to the var outside the method
[21:43:28] <tw2113> could you repaste the pastebin link?
[21:43:42] <Es0teric> tw2113, i didnt make a pastebin yet.. lol

[21:48:44] <aqeel> well room got to go ....bye
[21:48:48] <aqeel> have nice day
[21:51:15] <tw2113> that be a lot of looping
[21:51:39] <Es0teric> tw2113, it isâ€¦ i will localize it later to just fire the loop inside the element thats hovered over
[21:53:31] <hlve> Hey dudes, so I've gotten myself stuck again
[21:53:46] <Es0teric> hive, welcome to the club
[21:53:49] <hlve> ;)
[21:53:59] <Es0teric> why doesnt your name highlight?
[21:54:08] <hlve> Mine?
[21:54:11] <hlve> it's hlve, not hive :P
[21:54:21] <tw2113> halve without the A?
[21:54:26] <Es0teric> OHH
[21:54:29] <hlve> haha
[21:54:31] <Es0teric> hlve
[21:54:39] <Es0teric> lmao my client text is so small man...
[21:54:39] * hlve beep, beep.
[21:54:46] <hlve> I have mine set at 7px
[21:54:46] <hlve> lol
[21:54:52] <Es0teric> mine is at8
[21:54:53] <eddyb> hi
[21:54:59] <eddyb> I want to remove focus from an element
[21:55:00] <Es0teric> but im not squinting my eyes
[21:55:08] <hlve> =P
[21:55:13] <ngharo> Es0teric: your code is confusing.  You're looping over the same selection inside another loop.. why?
[21:55:13] <eddyb> .blur() works fine, except for the first element in the page
[21:55:18] <hlve> I like your name btw, please tell me it has something to do with the rapper?
[21:55:19] <hlve> :P
[21:55:28] <Es0teric> ngharo, you know.. i have NO idea
[21:55:35] <Es0teric> lol
[21:55:37] <Cork> eddyb: you can't really remove focus, only put it somewhere else
[21:55:48] <Cork> eddyb: something always has focus
[21:55:52] <eddyb> $(document.focus) doesn't really work
[21:55:55] <Es0teric> ngharo, i guess its because i know there are multiple elements of the same name (generated by a php loop(
[21:56:01] <eddyb> err
[21:56:15] <eddyb> $(document).focus()
[21:56:21] <eddyb> should I try focusing the body?
[21:56:23] <ngharo> Es0teric: you know you can bind to a collection of elements, and not just one at a time
[21:56:43] <Es0teric> ngharo, the elements have the same tags.. just different text
[21:56:44] <Cork> eddyb: don't remeber if its window, document or body that can have focus
[21:56:55] <Cork> eddyb: you'll just have to try them
[21:57:25] <Cork> eddyb: btw you don't need $()
[21:57:34] <Cork> eddyb: just do document.body.focus()
[21:57:40] <eddyb> damn... doesn't work
[21:58:40] <eddyb> I have some desktop-application-like menus, the ones that you click to open and click somewhere else (or an element in the menu) to close
[21:59:50] <Es0teric> i need to get some coffee from costcoâ€¦
[22:00:01] <Es0teric> cuz everyone knows that costco keeps the costs low...
[22:00:29] <ngharo> eddyb: document.activeElement.blur() work?
[22:01:03] <ngharo> Es0teric: same name as in class?
[22:01:10] <eddyb> I did .attr('tabindex', 0) so I could have focus on those menus, but now it seems like I should have done it the hard way...
[22:01:20] <Es0teric> yes, ngharo.. because its the parent element
[22:01:43] <ngharo> Es0teric: and you want to bind hover to each one of the same class?
[22:02:06] <eddyb> ngharo: that works :)
[22:02:50] <Es0teric> ngharo, no.. i want to bind a hover to the class assignmt_img and show/hide the <p> contentâ€¦ and when the mouse is out of the parent class (evnt_wrap) to show the original content
[22:04:13] <Es0teric> ngharo, not show hide - display the text "Edit event for (evnt_type)"
[22:05:10] <Mariaa> is there a jquery plugin that would let you rotate divs containing html in a carousel the way its done here http://www.marriott.com/default.mi ?
[22:05:31] <tw2113> hi Mariaa
[22:06:33] <Es0teric> Mariaa, the source for that isâ€¦ sooooooooooo spread out
[22:08:01] <ngharo> Es0teric: is there only one <p> instead each .wrkwk?
[22:08:47] <Es0teric> ngharo, there is a .wrkwk and a .wknd
[22:09:17] <Es0teric> ngharo, its a <ul> that seperates the workweek from the weekend
[22:09:56] <Es0teric> so theres a .wrkwk for every event
[22:10:12] <Mariaa> hi tw2113
[22:10:21] <tw2113> long time no see :P
[22:10:40] <Mariaa> yeah, was busy at school :/
[22:10:58] <Mariaa> how have you been?
[22:11:07] <ngharo> Es0teric: yeah gonna need to see markup.  this shit is bonkers
[22:11:09] <tw2113> eh same-o
[22:11:50] <Mariaa> Es0teric: can you point me to a similar jquery script or plugin?
[22:13:12] <Es0teric> ngharo i'll show you the mark up real quick...
[22:13:14] <Es0teric> i gotta get the source
[22:13:25] <Es0teric> because i have HTML/PHP tags in my stuff
[22:13:33] <hlve> can I borrow somebodies knowledge for a sec to let me know what I'm screwing up lol
[22:13:34] <Es0teric> and Mariaa idk
[22:13:34] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/JSRfT/
[22:14:13] <raj> how can I get the registration popup to fit its contents? http://68.46.138.78:8080/
[22:16:17] <hlve> :/
[22:18:31] <hlve> Anybody?
[22:21:16] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/JSRfT/ ?? ;/
[22:21:30] <Es0teric> ngharo -> http://pastebin.com/zjzBm1kE
[22:22:03] <ngharo> hlve: select jquery from the pulldown on the left
[22:22:28] <hlve> oh I feel really stupid.
[22:22:31] <hlve> Jesus
[22:22:33] <hlve> thank you
[22:22:34] * hlve blushes
[22:23:21] <hlve> now that it's actually loading that piece, i can get to my question lol
[22:24:01] <Es0teric> ngharo, the class thats .wrkwk_op is diff because it has more padding due to the numbers, but i want to treat it the same as .wrkwk
[22:24:50] <hlve> What would be the best way to have http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/JSRfT/11/ to check if a number is greater than zero in either of the a tags, and if it is, add a class?
[22:25:09] <hlve> i've been at this all night, google hasn't been much help :9
[22:26:06] <hlve> Hmph
[22:26:27] <ngharo> if (parseInt($(this).text(), 10) > 0) {
[22:27:02] <Es0teric> manâ€¦ i am starting to appreciate PHP more now..
[22:27:48] <ngharo> Es0teric: can you change your markup to put the "type" in the <p> tag, like <p data-type="Option">...</p>
[22:28:20] <Es0teric> ngharo.. alittle HTML5 magic eh?
[22:28:31] <ngharo> then we can grab type easily via $(p).data('type')
[22:29:00] <Es0teric> ngharo, what about browsers that arent upgraded for HTML5?
[22:29:11] <ngharo> Es0teric: jquery will take care of it
[22:29:17] <Es0teric> hmm
[22:29:20] <Es0teric> alright then.. give me a min
[22:30:47] <Es0teric> ngharo -> http://pastebin.com/pfZe3PHm
[22:32:43] <Mapper99> Is there a way I can replace all the tooltips (title="...") with a better looking tooltip/baloon without a lot of work?
[22:34:03] <Es0teric> Mapper99, use tipsy
[22:35:08] <Shanu> hi
[22:35:11] <Shanu> all
[22:35:11] <ngharo> Es0teric: your markup is busted btw.  you have <li><li></li></li>
[22:36:04] <Es0teric> ngharo, actually i have  <li>parent content<li>child content</li></li>
[22:36:38] <ngharo> then you need a <ul></ul> between
[22:37:06] <ngharo> its causing shits to breaks
[22:37:10] <Es0teric> i see...
[22:38:18] <Es0teric> ngharo, nested <ul>'s have always been a problem for me
[22:38:21] <Es0teric> because i forget
[22:38:51] <Es0teric> ngharo, so i can replace <div class="evnt_wrap"> with <ul class="evnt_wrap">
[22:39:24] <Mapper99> <Es0teric> - I need something more rounded and balloon like
[22:39:48] <Es0teric> Mapper99, then idk.. lol tipsy is all i really need for my projects
[22:43:07] <ngharo> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/hWD2W/2/
[22:43:23] <ngharo> Es0teric: only works on first one, because i fixed the markup
[22:43:32] <Es0teric> i see, ngharo
[22:44:54] <Es0teric> ngharo, that looksâ€¦ so much
[22:44:55] <Es0teric> cleaner
[22:44:57] <Es0teric> lol
[22:45:22] <ngharo> uh yeah, loops aren't cool bro
[22:46:19] <Es0teric> ngharo, yeah on js they arentâ€¦ but im so used to looping through everything on PHP
[22:46:26] <tw2113> i was kind of curious if the class aspect would auto-apply to each one
[22:49:25] <Es0teric> ngharo, what you wrote applies to anything as long as it has the data type right?
[22:50:27] <ngharo> ya
[22:50:31] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/hWD2W/3/
[22:51:11] <Es0teric> lol.. ballsack
[22:51:36] <ngharo> PEE DATATYPE BALLSACK
[22:51:53] <ngharo> i should goto bed
[22:52:54] <Es0teric> lol
[22:52:57] <Es0teric> but thanks, ngharo
[22:53:57] <tw2113> haven't quite figured out a killer use for data-type*
[22:55:13] <hlve> what on earth is wrong with this line?
[22:55:13] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/QuskAW6U
[22:55:19] * hlve is about to give up for the night
[22:56:00] <Es0teric> no rest for the weary man...
[22:56:02] <Es0teric> sleep is not needed
[22:56:09] <ngharo> hlve: is that code inside an event handler?
[22:56:23] <hlve> that's where this gets tricky.
[22:56:30] <hlve> I'm writing a greasemonkey script lol
[22:56:41] <ngharo> hlve: do you expect 'this' to be 'a.GUEST' ?
[22:56:49] <ngharo> because it's not
[22:56:53] <hlve> no i know it's not
[22:57:04] <hlve> i've ripped the code to pieces in hopes to get it working
[22:57:57] <ngharo> less than zero?
[22:58:30] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/FbKYMme1
[22:58:39] <hlve> that's the code that I had when it was working in jsfiddle
[22:58:52] <hlve> but when I brought it over to Greasemonkey, it just didn't function
[22:59:21] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/JSRfT/20/ ^^ That's the JSFiddle
[23:00:00] <ngharo> alert($.fn.jquery); in your gmonkey script
[23:00:06] <ngharo> whats it say?
[23:00:20] <hlve> 1.3.2
[23:02:22] <hlve> I wonder if it's just an incompatibility between jQuery and Greasemonkey... I have no idea what else it could be.
[23:04:51] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/JSRfT/21/
[23:05:27] <ngharo> you dont have to ID stuff you already have a reference to
[23:05:39] <ngharo> dunno if that helps your problem at all though
[23:06:33] <hlve> Oh I love you
[23:06:44] <hlve> I've spent the past few hours on this damn code man
[23:06:48] <hlve> Thank you SO much
[23:08:48] <ngharo> yay
[23:18:03] <Qalqi> i have .ajax() fn with html datatype. How do I search for an element in this data
[23:18:17] <Qalqi> seems like html datatype is a text document
[23:19:24] <ngharo> $(data).find( ... )
[23:21:06] <dunkel2> hello
[23:26:03] <elfrancesco> hi i am reading http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide57 i am not sure to understand why checkFoo will always write that foo is false... is it  because the second declaration of checkFoo overwrite the preceding one ?
[23:27:04] <elfrancesco> umm forget it i didn't read the next slide.... sorry for disturbing
[23:28:46] <ngharo> ajpiano is full of tricks
[23:29:35] <elfrancesco> ajpiano: thanks for your great site (fixingthesesjquery.com)
[23:52:47] <AQEEL> hi room
[23:53:30] <Es0teric> data-type
[23:53:34] <Es0teric> is garbage
[23:53:55] <mindis|wurk> huh?
[23:54:53] <Es0teric> i am using data-type right now
[23:55:15] <Es0teric> and for some freakin reason, eventhough there are multiple elements with different data-types, jquery is reading JUST ONE
[23:55:24] <Es0teric> its not actively changing the data-type
