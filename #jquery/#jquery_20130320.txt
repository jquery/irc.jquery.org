[00:04:38] <sylock> Hello guys. I don't know how/understand how can I use traversing selector to process a range of table rows from start to end (say that I would want to process with each() the row 4 to row 6.
[00:05:56] <sylock> concretely, I want to make a selection in a table with the SHIFHT key to select a range of items. I already store the last click item DOM reference into a variable, and I know of course the DOM element when I click on with SHIFT
[00:06:11] <sylock> but I don't understand, with these two DOM in hands how to deal with them
[00:31:01] <iGive> whoaa
[00:31:08] <iGive> hello all
[00:31:45] <iGive> this is my firstime, joining jquery irc channel :D
[00:37:58] <grafi> woohoo
[00:44:52] <Hilton> I have set up a form using the change() event to trigger an ajax save of every field as its edited. The only time the ajax isn't fired is if the field isn't changed (obviously). Is there any way I can have an "escape to cancel" functionality which will return the input to its previous value?
[00:48:20] <AdamPDotty> You would have to save the previous value, like data-prev="I was".
[00:52:13] <pixelBash_> hmm... wondering if there is a way to have multiple attributes like classes
[00:52:42] <AdamPDotty> not multiple class attributes, but multiple classes
[00:53:10] <pixelBash_> as in hasClass('class1') would find <div class="class1 class2"></div> but with hasAttr('attr1') <div data-attr="attr1 attr2"></div>
[00:54:08] <pixelBash_> only way i can think of right now is string split attribute on " " and do an each, but messy
[00:55:55] <AdamPDotty> you could copy that data-attr to a blind divs class, but still not nice
[00:56:23] <pixelBash_> yeah not ideal
[00:57:56] <pixelBash_> $('input[data-attr~="attr1"]')
[00:58:23] <pixelBash_> I think. yay selector engine
[00:58:51] <AdamPDotty> $(element).find('data-attr~="attr1"']).length
[00:58:59] <AdamPDotty> ah not quite
[00:59:07] <pixelBash_> if(length > 0)
[00:59:19] <AdamPDotty> length already is falsy
[00:59:28] <pixelBash_> size()?
[00:59:31] <AdamPDotty> but find goes deeper in hierarchy
[01:00:03] <AdamPDotty> so it should be filter()
[01:00:03] <pixelBash_> yeah needs to be that specific depth but answers close enough to use
[01:00:16] <pixelBash_> sweet
[01:11:10] <Yatekii> He folks! Does anyone know an answer to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15518289/jquery-how-to-read-and-format-data-for-autocomplete-using-ajax ?
[01:12:45] <tdignan> Yatekii: do  " source: function() { },
[01:12:46] <tdignan> "
[01:12:57] <tdignan> that's how you pass an anonymous function as the source parameter.
[01:13:14] <tdignan> then in that function you'll likely have to populate the autocomplete
[01:13:38] <tdignan> oh you have that already -- never mind.
[01:14:09] <Yatekii> Ye thanks anyways man!
[01:14:39] <tdignan> on your function
[01:14:53] <tdignan> I believe you should have: function(request, response) {  response([1,2,3]) }
[01:14:56] <tdignan> try that.
[01:15:06] <tdignan> then later substitute your ajax code to work that way
[01:18:34] <joelataylor> anyone tell me why the RegExp for this isn't valid? var pat = new RegExp('soundcloud\.com\/[a-zA-Z][\w-]*\/([a-zA-Z][\w-]*)?\/?$');
[01:18:34] <joelataylor> 		var pat = /soundcloud\.com\/[a-zA-Z][\w-]*\/([a-zA-Z][\w-]*)?\/?$/;
[01:18:56] <joelataylor> (the second straight regex pattern works)
[01:57:48] <anli> jquery-animate-colors-min.js causes d.Tween is undefined, why?
[01:59:43] <rabbi1> how to add a class to the parent element which has a class ( the parent element is not the immediate parent of the element) ?
[02:00:14] <seutje> anli: how ancient is that and what version of jquery are you trying to use it with?
[02:00:49] <BarisW> Can I use multiple attribute selectors at once?
[02:01:00] <seutje> sure
[02:01:17] <seutje> $('[attr=val][otherattr=otherval]')
[02:01:20] <BarisW> Eg: $('li[data-id="id1" data-class="class1"]')
[02:01:29] <BarisW> ah, so not combine them in brackets?
[02:01:42] <BarisW> thanks!
[02:01:54] <seutje> $('li[data-id="id1"][data-class="class1"]')
[02:01:59] <BarisW> seutje: By the way, do you live here? :D
[02:02:03] <seutje> iz like css
[02:02:15] <seutje> BarisW: only during DB imports and PSD load times ;)
[02:02:22] <BarisW> Hahaha :D
[02:02:23] <seutje> oh, and svn checkouts
[02:03:23] <BarisW> svn? What's that? :D
[02:04:38] <rabbi1> $('.myclass form[name="formname'"]').parent().find('div').hasClass('myclass').addClass('something');  This isn't working...
[02:05:43] <seutje> BarisW: something that makes branches a royal pain in the ass
[02:06:35] <seutje> rabbi1: hassClass returns a boolean
[02:06:44] <seutje> booleans don't have a method addClass
[02:06:58] <seutje> the console could have told you that of course
[02:07:10] <rabbi1> yeap
[02:07:34] <seutje> and don't ask me why I always type an extra s in hasClass
[02:07:38] <rabbi1> set a variable ?
[02:07:44] <seutje> I think it has to do with Mr Hasselhoff
[02:08:36] <rabbi1> hassClass ?
[02:08:42] <rabbi1> curious
[02:08:47] <seutje> var $foo = $('.myclass form[name="formname'"]').parent().find('div.myclass'); if ($foo.length) { $foo.addClass('something'); } ?
[02:09:12] <seutje> that traversal is a bit awkward though
[02:09:53] <seutje> like .myclass is both a parent and a child to this form
[02:10:15] <rabbi1> seutje: one more thing to note here, that form is checked from .myclass itself, so any other way then ?
[02:10:39] <seutje> checked?
[02:10:49] <rabbi1> nope. .myclass is a parent of form, but there are 2 more parent to form after .myclass..
[02:11:14] <rabbi1> seutje: ignore checked, i meant jquery call ...
[02:11:45] <seutje> wait, are you looking for $('form[name="formname"]').closest('.myclass').addClass('something'); ?
[02:12:17] <rabbi1> seutje: yeap, i guess so… that should be the one i hope..
[02:12:26] <seutje> as in "find this form and stick this class to its closest parent that has the myclass class" ?
[02:12:38] <rabbi1> yeap, will try this
[02:13:12] <seutje> anli: seems to be updated versions of this, did not know, but seem to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/v8nua/ also note that jQuery UI can do this for you if you have need for it for other components
[02:14:01] <rabbi1> seutje: yeap, great that what i was looking for 'closest' …..
[02:14:30] <rabbi1> thank you
[02:14:43] <seutje> yeah, parent is only direct parent and parents matches all elements going up in the chain
[02:14:59] <seutje> closest does the same as parents but stops after finding one
[02:18:08] <anli> seutje: So I will not need any plugins other than jquery+jqueryui to animate text color?
[02:18:50] <seutje> anli: exactly!
[02:18:51] <seutje> http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[02:19:02] <seutje> anli: hell, jquery UI can even animate classes
[02:19:04] <anli> must check
[02:19:19] <anli> thats cool, would be nice to get colors from the css file btw
[02:19:28] <anli> Can do that with classes then?
[02:19:51] <seutje> http://jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[02:20:02] <seutje> http://jqueryui.com/switchClass/
[02:20:34] <anli> Maybe I have an old version of jqueryui
[02:21:03] <anli> It is 1.8.14
[02:21:19] <seutje> not sure
[02:21:40] <anli> cool stuff
[02:26:46] <rabbi1> seutje: i got a list of elements, say <ul><li>….. 10 <li>'s ….. </li></ul> and i need to add class for the last 4 <li> dynamically.. How can i target only those last 4 <li> ? is there a way ?
[02:27:02] <Trudko> Guys why isnt the div cloned? http://jsbin.com/oruyid/1/edit
[02:27:04] <DarsVaeda> how do I bind stuff to feature elements without an event?
[02:28:10] <AdamPDotty> rabbi1: there was something with nth-child, I do not recall the details
[02:28:46] <rabbi1> Trudko: you have mentioned class and in js it is for 'id'
[02:28:57] <DarsVaeda> I mean future elements...
[02:29:07] <Trudko> rabbi1: lol ofc i did *facepalm*
[02:30:02] <DarsVaeda> I have jquery plugin (tipsy) and I want to bind it to future rows in a table
[02:30:08] <rabbi1> AdamPDotty: will look for it… i have used it, but never tried for last 4 elements …
[02:30:50] <marcules> Good morning :)
[02:31:56] <seutje> ?gt @ rabbi1
[02:31:56] <bot-t> rabbi1, :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[02:32:19] <marcules> I should be able to use $('.someClass').on('click', callbackFunction); in jQuery 1.8.2, right? I do not have to rely on .live?
[02:32:53] <seutje> rabbi1: don't think it supports negative numbers though
[02:33:12] <seutje> but u could just use the length of the matched set
[02:34:00] <seutje> var $foo = $('ul li'); $foo.gt($foo.length - 5).addClass('meh'); or something
[02:34:29] <rabbi1> seutje: ok, actually i am using angularjs's ng-repeat. so, i think negative might not be required, i can set for the first 6 elements and ignore the rest 4.. hope it works …. thanks
[02:34:49] <seutje> ?lt @ rabbi1
[02:34:49] <bot-t> rabbi1, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[02:35:21] <rabbi1> before this, let me check how indexing is done here …. :)
[02:35:27] <seutje> shit, I didn't mean to link to the sizzle selector extensions
[02:35:32] <seutje> use the methods instead
[02:35:53] <seutje> it's 0-indexed
[02:36:27] <rabbi1> brb, too late for lunch … .
[02:36:39] <rabbi1> very hungry
[02:42:26] <john-dev> hey there, i try to animate a text using marginRight, but somehow it changes the margin-top value, without animation.. any ideas?
[02:45:55] <john-dev> http://v2.wepixel.de check the right navigation
[02:47:32] <john-dev> got it, thanks :)
[02:48:25] <anli> I can use switchClass from one class to another, but not after a while switch back again
[02:48:52] <anli> I assume it can be used how many times I want?
[02:53:52] <blackout> could someone help me to access the input field? I'm not experienced with this hierarchical stuff jet     --  thx ----http://www.zimagez.com/miniature/screenshot-03202013-105111am.php
[02:55:30] <rabbi1> seutje: the example in the link you gave works, but when i change it to $("tr:gt(4) td").css("color", "red"); doesn't work :(
[02:56:19] <blackout> http://en.zimagez.com/full/b779775670fb6fa0329a618ec91320d45124079bc822dfab6924c0fb25bf0a9def5065f0fdbb8bec995a4c719df3a8b34ab69cd7096b40b1.php
[02:59:07] <seutje> rabbi1: odd, can't reproduce: http://jsfiddle.net/CmA5j/
[02:59:11] <anli> a.switchClass("cl1", "cl2", 1000, "easeInOutQuad", function() { console.log("foo");}); works, but not
[02:59:19] <anli> a.switchClass("cl2", "cl1", 1000, "easeInOutQuad", function() { console.log("foo2");});
[02:59:20] <seutje> rabbi1: are you sure you're not running the query before the elements exist?
[02:59:23] <anli> will never print foo2
[02:59:34] <anli> And I will never get cl1 back again
[02:59:47] <rabbi1> seutje: nope, that is the problem I have with DOM (angularjs) will rework…
[03:00:25] <seutje> anli: are you trying to switch back and forth?
[03:00:29] <anli> yes
[03:00:35] <anli> Not at the same time of course
[03:00:43] <seutje> u have to switch back in the callback, or use deferreds
[03:00:57] <seutje> right now, ur running them at the same time?
[03:01:08] <anli> But I dont want to switch back directly after switching
[03:01:24] <anli> I switch back after 7 seconds, a long time after the first switch
[03:01:36] <seutje> oh u ran these manually?
[03:01:47] <anli> yes
[03:01:55] <anli> What is manually?
[03:01:56] <anli> :)
[03:02:52] <xhoy> i have a design pattern question, i have data that i would like to display something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/nvP3E/
[03:03:34] <xhoy> problem is that with collapsing and expanding the 'table' gets really spagettiesch
[03:04:15] <xhoy> with nested tables i stil need to collaps the hole TR/TD instead of the table?
[03:05:49] <seutje> anli: weird, can't reproduce: http://jsfiddle.net/J5gVA/
[03:10:31] <anli> http://jsfiddle.net/J5gVA/1/ seems to work ok
[03:10:35] <anli> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/J5gVA/1/
[03:11:13] <anli> Cant reproduce the error... :)
[03:11:25] <seutje> anli: don't use onclick attributes :(
[03:11:30] <anli> hy not?
[03:11:33] <anli> why not
[03:11:37] <seutje> tight coupling
[03:11:48] <seutje> ur functions need to be defined in a global scope this way
[03:11:56] <anli> I disagree, it is tighter if you specify the click action in the link
[03:12:05] <anli> hm
[03:12:34] <anli> It is a global action on the other hand to click on a link
[03:13:23] <anli> I think it is tighter to use the attributes, maybe I should write a blog about it ;)
[03:13:25] <mmlac> How can I trigger a mouseover on an area but only trigger the mouse out / mouse leave when I leave the area EVEN THOUGH another element moves in between the mouse and the triggering element?
[03:13:30] <mmlac> I get a flickering using hover
[03:13:41] <mmlac> and a high z-index kills the click event on the lower element
[03:14:24] <seutje> anli: so ur using attributes cause u think attributes are tighter coupled ?
[03:14:48] <anli> I dont need to search to see which handlers that are connected to a certain element
[03:14:54] <anli> I see it instantly
[03:15:01] <anli> Without opening the js file
[03:15:05] <seutje> now bind multiple to a single element
[03:15:08] <seutje> now delegate them
[03:15:13] <seutje> u can't
[03:15:13] <anli> There is no magic in other words
[03:15:41] <anli> I never have the need of multiple event handlers on click, I think such constructs are causing problems btw
[03:16:01] <anli> The simpliest way I can think of is to only run one method when an event occurs
[03:16:03] <seutje> anli: ever dealt with dynamic content?
[03:16:13] <anli> I do it ever day, no need to be rude
[03:16:16] <anli> every
[03:16:22] <seutje> how?
[03:16:44] <anli> It is a question that I translate to "are you really doing what you preach?"
[03:16:54] <seutje> <body onclick="elGrandoClickHandler()"> ?
[03:17:19] <anli> I would not put a click handler there, body is btw a good candidate for adding a click handler in script
[03:18:00] <anli> Because the purpose often is to close down some dialog etc
[03:18:08] <seutje> but then u end up with handlers and attributes, all over the place
[03:18:14] <seutje> not necessarily
[03:18:17] <anli> I do not have that problem
[03:18:22] <anli> I never sais necessarily
[03:18:25] <anli> said
[03:18:52] <seutje> $('body').on('click', 'a.dynamically-added-link', function() { /* always works */ });
[03:19:06] <seutje> it's on the body
[03:19:16] <anli> The best way of keeping track of which click handlers you are using is to use attributes, then you know that exactly one thing is happening on an event
[03:19:27] <zarac> What's a good way to get an elements ancestor matching whichever comes first of one of two selectors. E.g. <section><article><button class="toggle">toggle</button></article></section> would give me the article while <article><section><button class="toggle">toggle</button></section></article> would give me the section.
[03:19:43] <anli> The tighter way is to add an event handler to "a" itself instead of going via body
[03:19:56] <anli> I also find it strange that people use "live"
[03:20:03] <seutje> it's deprecated
[03:20:14] <anli> ok
[03:20:31] <seutje> so u define all ur handlers in the global scope and never have a conflict?
[03:20:42] <seutje> your coworkers don't come strangling u in ur sleep?
[03:20:56] <anli> There is no reason, now you are rude and possibly stupid
[03:21:14] <anli> I like that live is deprecated
[03:21:16] <seutje> how so?
[03:21:38] <anli> handlers are different from other functions
[03:21:53] <anli> They should mosly only calll other functions, they only thing they need to do
[03:21:57] <anli> -l
[03:22:08] <anli> They are the interface to the real code
[03:22:11] <seutje> I disagree
[03:22:17] <anli> "real"
[03:22:26] <seutje> I've often ran a function through each and then re-used it as a handler
[03:22:36] <anli> "I disagree" is  better than "your coworkers will strangle you"
[03:22:52] <seutje> to set initial state
[03:23:00] <seutje> I didn't even say that, I asked if they did
[03:23:00] <anli> It is better to only use a handler as a handler, I think
[03:23:15] <seutje> cause if I had a coworker that use onclick attributes, I'd consider taking time off to strangle him
[03:23:20] <seutje> used*
[03:23:43] <DansVC> hi
[03:23:48] <anli> If you want to know what happends on click and you dont want to read the js, the attribute is a good place
[03:24:14] <seutje> I use my browser for that
[03:24:20] <seutje> it knows about all handlers
[03:24:24] <anli> And as I say, there is no magic, and you know only one thing will happen, instead of having a zillion of handlers, you have one, a tight straw where your flow can pass
[03:24:43] <anli> But code is for people, not browsers
[03:25:08] <anli> I need to continue, thanks for chatting
[03:25:19] <seutje> I shouldn't need to dig through the entire CMS to figure out what elements have this attribute
[03:25:39] <seutje> so u'd need to use the browser anyway
[03:25:58] <anli> A handler should only be run from one element
[03:26:27] <anli> Then you can give your handler a good name
[03:26:33] <seutje> o.O
[03:26:49] <seutje> so no modular components?
[03:26:55] <seutje> just 1 close button for the entire site?
[03:27:21] <anli> No, what I am saying is that one handler should only be the result of one event in one element
[03:27:40] <anli> So one handler is not run from two or more places
[03:28:21] <seutje> that essentially means u can't have 2 slideshows on the same page
[03:28:37] <seutje> cause the "next" button of slideshow 1 cannot trigger the same function of slideshow 2
[03:29:02] <seutje> the same function of the "next" button of slideshow 2
[03:29:05] <rabbi1> seutje: that code works very well, not in my case.. will check out angularjs. coz they have clearly said not to manipulate DOM dynamically using jquery when using angularjs, should there be some alternate… thanks a lot for your time.
[03:29:13] <anli> I dont follow the slideshow example
[03:29:23] <seutje> prototypal inheritance makes instanciable objects so powerful, why not use it?
[03:29:40] <seutje> u said 1 handler per element
[03:29:44] <anli> yes
[03:29:53] <anli> No, one element per handler
[03:30:28] <seutje> so I cannot have <div class="slideshow"> ...... <a class="slideshow-next" onclick="slideshowNext()">Next</a></div> <div class="slideshow"> ...... <a class="slideshow-next" onclick="slideshowNext()">Next</a></div>
[03:30:34] <seutje> as they are both calling the same function
[03:30:40] <seutje> 2 elements, 1 handler
[03:30:57] <seutje> why should I reproduce the exact same function just for the sake of having a separate function?
[03:31:10] <anli> Well, they are from the same component, its a bit different, however, I would never create a slideshow in html, but create it entirely with script
[03:31:46] <seutje> but then the handlers are "magic" and u need to open the script to find em?
[03:32:08] <seutje> or do u generate html with onclick attributes from js?
[03:32:09] <anli> I can show you how I would do a slideshow if I get the time
[03:32:25] <anli> No, I manipulate the dom
[03:32:31] <seutje> $('body').append('<a onclick="magic()"
[03:32:35] <anli> Will not use attributes at all in a js component
[03:32:46] <anli> Never appending to body
[03:32:57] <anli> I append to a $(this), which uses to be a div
[03:33:02] <anli> Well, see ya
[03:34:22] <seutje> that doesn't even matter, but ok, I hope I never have to deal this mix-and-match shit
[03:35:32] <anli> Wow, how that did not make sense, but lets end with saying that then
[03:35:38] <Dcarlier> Hey
[03:36:07] <Dcarlier> I've got a question regarding jQuery UI, maybe someone knows the solution
[03:37:04] <Dcarlier> When i start dragging with the Draggable Widget, the ui object is being snapped to the bottom off my containment
[03:37:12] <Dcarlier> Does anyone know what coud cause this?

[03:59:57] <Braden`> How do I change the style of an element?
[04:00:07] <Braden`> $('div#element'). ?
[04:01:42] <NoWired> Braden`, with .css: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:05:40] <anli> seutje: I like how switchClass could animate between font sizes stepless
[04:05:47] <anli> It was a nice tip
[04:07:30] <Ice_Strike> Do you know any good jQuery plugin that allow me to put number of sales in each day on the monthly calenders?
[04:10:24] <benjick> var html = dom.filter('.wrapper').html(); - this gives me undefined, but there is a class named wrapper on the page
[04:10:34] <benjick> var title = dom.filter('title').text(); - this works, np
[04:11:34] <Braden`> How do I determine the jquery ajax response using firebug?
[04:11:47] <Braden`> I am not seeing an error, but not getting the desired results.
[04:12:04] <Cork> Braden`: do you have the content in the response section?
[04:12:49] <Braden`> I have it json encoded
[04:12:58] <Braden`> But
[04:13:10] <Braden`> I am not sure where the content of the response action is stored
[04:22:01] <benjick> http://pastebin.com/bhDTfSq4 this is my complete code. title gets set, but when i do stuff with .html instead of .text it just returns undefined
[04:23:15] <Cork> benjick: you almost guaranteed want find not filter
[04:23:37] <Cork> benjick: filter only works if the element your looking for is the outer most element in data
[04:23:59] <benjick> oh, hence why title is working
[04:24:10] <Cork> like data = "<title></title><div id='site-navigation'"
[04:24:16] <Cork> * like data = "<title></title><div id='site-navigation'></div>"
[04:24:23] <Braden`> How do I determine the jquery ajax response using firebug?
[04:24:53] <benjick> Cork: that solved it. thank you!
[04:25:10] <Cork> Braden`: all you can see is the raw response content
[04:25:22] <Cork> Braden`: you need to check the rest in the callbacks
[04:25:35] <Braden`> Where do I find the callbacks?  (the DOM section is huge)
[04:26:14] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function() { /* here */ }).fail(function() { /* or here */ })
[04:26:22] <Cork> as an example
[04:26:34] <Cork> its not part of the dom
[04:31:54] <Dcarlier> I've got a question regarding jQuery UI, maybe someone knows the solution
[04:31:56] <Braden`> var request = $.ajax({ url: "/scripts.php", type: "post", data: serializedData });  <-- That is all I would need to submit an ajax query, right?
[04:31:57] <Dcarlier> When i start dragging with the Draggable Widget, the ui object is being snapped to the bottom off my containment
[04:32:06] <Dcarlier> Does anyone know what could cause this?
[04:32:25] <Cork> Braden`: yes, as long as you don't care about what happens
[04:33:01] <Braden`> Cork:  Well, I have callbacks in place
[04:33:12] <Cork> on the request object then?
[04:33:29] <Braden`> Aye
[04:33:35] <Braden`> Let me paste to pastebin
[04:33:36] <Braden`> One sec
[04:36:05] <Braden`> http://ideone.com/FYqhOV <-- the .done() is not getting called, but the .always() is.
[04:36:44] <Cork> and fail isn't?
[04:37:00] <Braden`> Nay
[04:37:10] <Cork> btw jQuery.parseJSON(response); most likely fails
[04:37:25] <Cork> as long as your sever sends the correct content-type at least
[04:37:25] <Braden`> Though, I am not sure which console it is writing to
[04:37:31] <Braden`> Nothing shows in firebug though regarding it
[04:38:03] <Cork> it will show up in the console, unless the built in console gets in the way (happens some times)
[04:38:09] <Cork> you can check ctrl+shift+k too
[04:38:32] <Cork> Braden`: anyway jQuery.parseJSON(response); isn't needed if the server says it sending json
[04:38:49] <Cork> header('Content-Type: application/json')
[04:39:18] <Cork> and ajax.innerHTML is most likely wrong too if you get json
[04:40:11] <Braden`> hmm
[04:40:17] <Braden`> innerHTML is a var I created
[04:40:29] <Braden`> and then json_encoded in php
[04:40:38] <Cork> you call your in your json innerHTML??
[04:40:53] <Cork> possible not the best name, but ok :)
[04:56:26] <nardev> Why variable cost doesn't preserve it's value out of callback function in $.get request? Here is what i do:    $.get(loadUrl, {}, function(response){ cost = response.replace(/\"/g,"");}, "html" );
[04:56:55] <Cork> nardev: callbacks are async
[04:57:10] <Cork> they are called after the code later in the outer function
[04:57:22] <nardev> Cork, is there any way i to get that value?
[04:57:28] <nardev> for later use?
[04:57:33] <Cork> write the code in the callback
[04:57:47] <nardev> cork, ok, thank you.
[04:58:07] <Cork> nardev: you can use deferred if you prefer
[04:58:33] <Cork> $.get(loadUrl, {}).done(function(response){ cost = response.replace(/\"/g,"");});
[04:58:50] <nardev> Cork, thank you i think i will
[04:59:11] <Cork> nardev: you can also forward the return value from $.get
[04:59:13] <nardev> Cork, i have few consecutive requests
[04:59:17] <Cork> and bind .done later
[05:00:01] <nardev> Cork, thank you v.m.
[05:01:59] <BadCodSmell> I have <div><span/><span/></div><div><span/><span/></div>, what selector gets the second child of each one?
[05:02:15] <BadCodSmell> I thought it was nth child but my experimentations show weirdness
[05:02:36] <miCSu> try :eq
[05:02:47] <Cork> BadCodSmell: you mean the second span of each div?
[05:02:53] <miCSu> the indexes are different
[05:03:35] <BadCodSmell> its actually my test selector that sucks
[05:03:45] <BadCodSmell> i cant nth-child(4..7) ?
[05:05:07] <BadCodSmell> my selector is huge/unrolled and hard to debug :)
[05:06:05] <Cork> BadCodSmell: i would suggest trying to simplify then then :)
[05:06:38] <BadCodSmell> I guess it might just be an unavoidable hazard with CSS/js selectors
[05:07:27] <Cork> $('div span:eq(3)').(function() { return $(this).nextAll(); }); ?
[05:08:26] <Cork> BadCodSmell: no, you can always build your site to keep the selectors simple
[05:15:34] <nardev> Cork again, when i add response value to some global variable, i can't use it further in code :(
[05:15:44] <nardev> It's only usable inside .done(...)
[05:16:00] <Cork> nardev: you can't get data out of the callback
[05:16:10] <Cork> cause then your in a race condition
[05:16:23] <nardev> Cork, :( and i need it :(
[05:16:36] <Cork> as your code continues, and when the net responds it gets called, and the code don't wait
[05:16:48] <Cork> nardev: then you should redactor your code
[05:17:03] <nardev> Cork,  :( feel so sad for hearing that :D
[05:17:05] <nardev> :(
[05:17:08] <nardev> oki
[05:17:08] <Cork> return the response from $.get and everywhere you need to use it use the callback
[05:17:09] <nardev> thank you
[05:17:30] <Cork> nardev: alternatively you can define a callback before the $.get call
[05:17:42] <Cork> and then call those callbacks from inside the callback
[05:17:49] <Cork> if you want to preprocess the data
[05:18:40] <nardev> Cork, i understand, i'll just call the function that is defined outside
[05:19:36] <Cork> var dataCall; $.get().done(function(data) { /* preprocess */ data.fire(data); }); return dataCall; ...dataCall.add(function(data) { /* work with the data */ });
[05:19:43] <Cork> opps
[05:19:49] <Cork> var dataCall; $.get().done(function(data) { /* preprocess */ dataCall.fire(data); }); return dataCall; ...dataCall.add(function(data) { /* work with the data */ });
[05:19:56] <Cork> fail again...
[05:19:57] <nardev> thank you you are so kind
[05:20:01] <Cork> var dataCall = $.Callbacks; $.get().done(function(data) { /* preprocess */ dataCall.fire(data); }); return dataCall; ...dataCall.add(function(data) { /* work with the data */ });
[05:20:12] <Cork> bah... just read http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.fire/
[05:20:15] <Che-Anarc> How can I set> $(my_checkbox").prop("checked", false);  ?? I've set that on click action to diselect selection based on another buttons action.
[05:20:24] <Cork> apparently my coding sucks today :/
[05:20:47] <Cork> Che-Anarc: are you preventing the click default action?
[05:20:57] <Cork> event.preventDefault() in the click callback
[05:21:21] <Che-Anarc> Cork - hmm actually not... but the click is not being invoked from the checkbox rather from another button  -  so would I still need to do that?
[05:21:31] <Cork> no
[05:21:49] <Cork> and the $(my_checkbox") actually match the checkbox?
[05:21:54] <Che-Anarc> Cork - I have another sort of method from the checkbox div container itself to self close an any single choice that works.
[05:22:00] <Cork> console.log($(my_checkbox").length)
[05:22:18] <Che-Anarc> Cork 1 sec I try.... i get values - just cant seem to set.
[05:22:27] <Cork> Che-Anarc: an event listener you mean?
[05:22:32] <Cork> prop doesn't trigger events
[05:24:52] <Che-Anarc> Cork: http://pastebin.com/esjQwANj
[05:25:06] <ravenzz> can someone think of a way to do this counter update with as less as selection as possible (maybe thanks to events) http://jsfiddle.net/mBUtL/
[05:25:21] <ravenzz> -as
[05:25:51] <MaDiNfO_> hi
[05:25:57] <MaDiNfO_> can somebody help me
[05:25:57] <MaDiNfO_> ?
[05:25:59] <Cork> Che-Anarc: you don't need if ($("#btnSave").length > 0)
[05:26:02] <MaDiNfO_> http://socios.jsrclubetiro.pt/teste.php
[05:26:06] <Cork> Che-Anarc: jquery will handle that for you
[05:26:06] <MaDiNfO_> why does this not work ?
[05:26:26] <Che-Anarc> Cork - so should I ommit it entierly?
[05:26:30] <Cork> yes
[05:26:53] <Cork> ?.ready @ MaDiNfO_
[05:26:53] <bot-t> MaDiNfO_, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[05:27:06] <MaDiNfO_> ?
[05:27:14] <Che-Anarc> Cork makes sense actually in that it wouldnt get on.click action?
[05:27:25] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: also your running in quirks mode, define a full html document
[05:27:43] <MaDiNfO_> how ?
[05:27:57] <Che-Anarc> Cork - any idea about the check issue? -
[05:28:15] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: uh <!doctype html><html><head></head><body></body></html>
[05:28:34] <MaDiNfO_> done
[05:28:40] <MaDiNfO_> still not working
[05:28:41] <Cork> Che-Anarc: if you want to trigger events on the check use trigger('click')
[05:28:58] <Cork> you still haven't added the missing function
[05:29:15] <Che-Anarc> Cork  missing function?
[05:29:17] <seba4> hi i got a question... i have a link that opens new form in a dialog.  The problem is that if i scroll down enough dialog is positioned ok, but if i see a link at the bottom of browser and click on it ... part of dialog is missing..
[05:29:20] <Cork> <bot-t> MaDiNfO_, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[05:29:25] <seba4> why this happends?
[05:29:59] <Braden`> Thank you Cork for the assistance :)
[05:30:08] <Cork> Braden`: yw
[05:30:21] <Braden`> Good night
[05:31:02] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: sorry i am not understanding
[05:31:15] <MaDiNfO_> new on jquery
[05:31:23] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: your code is running before the selct elements are in the dom
[05:31:29] <Cork> so your selectors doesn't find them
[05:31:38] <Cork> and cause of that; no option elements are added to them
[05:31:54] <Cork> so, delay you main function call through ready
[05:32:20] <Cork> so that it waits until the browser has loaded the html completely into the dom
[05:33:02] <ravenzz> Cork any idea?
[05:33:20] <Cork> ravenzz: didn't even see your question
[05:33:29] <Cork> oh up there
[05:35:06] <Che-Anarc> Cork - I like your trigger("click"); solution :-) only issue is that it inverts choices - but in my case I need them box's to be unchecked :-|
[05:35:38] <Cork> Che-Anarc: so prop('checked', true).trigger('click')
[05:35:51] <ravenzz> .prop('checked', false) ?
[05:35:57] <Cork> true
[05:36:03] <Cork> the click switches it to false
[05:36:17] <Cork> if you set it to false it will be true in the click
[05:36:26] <ravenzz> well when he says "Unchecked I suppose they are already checked"
[05:36:37] <Cork> well they might be
[05:36:44] <Cork> or they might be unchecked
[05:36:46] <Che-Anarc> Cork  indeed they might be  :_D
[05:37:11] <Cork> so so prop('checked', true).trigger('click') will set all to false
[05:37:56] <Che-Anarc> Cork  worked like charm!
[05:38:00] <Cork> if you want to be a bit cheaper you can try .filter(':checked').trigger('click')
[05:38:18] <Che-Anarc> Cork  in what way cheaper (for my own comprehension)
[05:38:35] <Cork> it won't trigger a lot of pointless events
[05:38:49] <Cork> it will only trigger it on the elements that is actually checked
[05:39:01] <Cork> the selector is a bit heavier though
[05:39:19] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: solved that changed the form
[05:39:21] <Che-Anarc> Cork - check... makes perfect sense - thanks for the insight
[05:39:27] <MaDiNfO_> to the beggining of document
[05:39:34] <MaDiNfO_> probably not the best
[05:39:38] <MaDiNfO_> but it works
[05:39:39] <MaDiNfO_> now
[05:39:44] <Cork> uh..
[05:40:02] <Cork> well ya, if you add the script at the bottom of body it works the same as ready
[05:40:11] <MaDiNfO_> :)
[05:40:24] <MaDiNfO_> but is not working on my main code... only on that test
[05:40:28] <MaDiNfO_> brb
[05:40:45] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: your script is prob not at the end of the document
[05:41:47] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: brb i will talk to you in one hour
[05:42:18] <seutje> should we sync watches?
[05:42:25] <Cork> lol
[05:42:56] <Che-Anarc> 1 other - effect I am tring to achieve (using jQM) - is to have checkbox's in place of default ui-icons... I can substitute icons and such - but is there anyway I can bind on click action to ui-icons only?... trying to achieve dynamic select and delete.
[05:45:17] <seutje> Che-Anarc: like $('body').on('click', '.ui-icon', fn); ?
[05:47:11] <jtbowlin> can someone please help me with a jquery ui tooltip question?
[05:47:28] <Cork> jtbowlin: not until you ask the question
[05:47:50] <jtbowlin> I want the tooltip to display the image that's in my title, but it's just displaying the text of img src
[05:47:51] <aMoniker> Cork: offer some advice anyway, there's a small chance it applies to him
[05:47:52] <Che-Anarc> seutje>  dont does seem to work since its already in a <li><a href=...>  which I e.preventDefault(); -  and then restor accordingly on another action but I just cant seem to get action on that specific element.
[05:48:55] <Cork> jtbowlin: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[05:49:28] <Yatekii> Guys, can someone of you help me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15518289/jquery-how-to-read-and-format-data-for-autocomplete-using-ajax ?
[05:49:34] <seutje> Che-Anarc: preventDefault doesn't stop bubbling, so it should still fire on the body
[05:49:54] <seutje> stopPropagation would
[05:50:14] <jtbowlin> yes, i've looked there.  I still don't get it as that's not really what I want.  I just simply want it to display the image html that's in my title attribute.  that custom-content demo is about google maps and other stuff
[05:51:55] <Che-Anarc> seutje  I do: http://pastebin.com/DwzQqqcd
[05:52:12] <jtbowlin> Cork: it just says to return an img code for google maps, which seems to work, but i just want to use the image code I have in my title attribute.  I don't understand why it's not working.
[05:52:20] <Che-Anarc> Maybe its the order by which I am preventDefault?
[05:52:58] <Cork> jtbowlin: you prob have to store the url in a separate attribute
[05:53:11] <Cork> cause i think tooltip actually removes the title attribute
[05:53:36] <ravenzz> Cork what do you think about this solution? http://jsfiddle.net/mBUtL/1/
[05:53:47] <ravenzz> $counter = $target.closest('ul[id]').prev('a').find('.component-menu-count'); is a pain in the ass :\
[05:54:12] <jtbowlin> Cork: It's displaying the title, but just the raw text instead of the image referenced.... this is what a line looks like for example: title="<img src='Img/Research/VR_Assailant_Prototype.png' />"
[05:54:27] <jtbowlin> It displays "title="<img src='Img/Research/VR_Assailant_Prototype.png' />" in the tooltip
[05:54:31] <Che-Anarc> http://pastebin.com/nPFBpfhm
[05:54:34] <Cork> jtbowlin: yes, cause you need to use custom content
[05:54:48] <Cork> jtbowlin: check the example on the link i gave you
[05:55:37] <Cork> jtbowlin: 1. don't put urls in the title, if its not something that works as a tooltip it shouldn't be in title
[05:55:50] <Cork> the example explains how to do it properly
[05:56:36] <jtbowlin> Cork: this is because most other plugins say to do it that way... i've been trying for two hours now.. let me test some more...
[05:56:40] <Cork> ravenzz: why are you going all the way around events?
[05:56:58] <Cork> ravenzz: just call an update function with the form as an argument
[05:57:49] <Cork> jtbowlin: i would say they don't know how to write proper html
[05:58:53] <ravenzz> Cork how should it update the filter count in question?
[05:59:14] <Cork> ravenzz: send the function the target element
[05:59:51] <ravenzz> still I don't understand ..
[06:00:00] <ravenzz> the target element is the checkbox
[06:00:03] <dd5> hi guys
[06:00:14] <ravenzz> the counter is a child of .filter
[06:00:18] <dd5> anyone used quicksand plugin before?
[06:00:32] <ravenzz> there is no real relation (link) between the two
[06:07:14] <Cork> jtbowlin: http://jsfiddle.net/trPRk/1/
[06:07:24] <adman65> hey. Given a selector can I do something like this: $("selector").parentIs("#sidebar") or $('selector').parentIs("#main") ?
[06:07:54] <Cork> you want any parent or just the direct parent?
[06:08:22] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[06:08:33] <masentinel900> A question!!
[06:08:39] <Cork> adman65: $("selector").closest('#sidebar').length if you want to know if it has the parent
[06:08:57] <Cork> adman65: $("selector").parent('#sidebar').length if you want to know if the direct parent matches
[06:09:37] <adman65> Cork: direct meaning foo > bar ?
[06:09:38] <masentinel900> On url fancybox can I set the new page and a specific div of that page like :: FunctionContent.#uno
[06:09:59] <clone1018> Does anyone know of a plugin that'll allow me to add controls to a div like Photoshops box/free rotation tools?
[06:10:15] <Cork> adajad: <div id="sidebar><span></span></span> vs <div id="sidebar><div><span></span></div></span>
[06:10:32] <adman65> ah
[06:10:33] <adman65> k

[06:16:25] <dd5> anyone knows how to setup callback between two plugins?
[06:17:38] <dd5> i've got quicksand plugin (http://razorjack.net/quicksand/) which i want to make it work with lazyloader (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload)
[06:18:28] <dd5> anyone got them working together?
[06:20:15] <Che-Anarc> OMG!  it was the z-index - thats why the click action on my icons where not working  :-p
[06:26:53] <soee> hi, how can i trigger some action if Enter key was pressed on input ?
[06:30:35] <Rchristiani> Soee: .keydown() or .keypress() events
[06:30:44] <Rchristiani> api.jquery.com/category/events/keyboard-events/
[06:33:48] <scar> i have a trigger using .on('click', function() {}) and i am disabling the trigger on click, then re-enabling once the action is done taking place... however if the user double clicks the item, it still makes it go whack. any other ideas besides .attr('disabled', true) ?
[06:34:19] <scar> i even attempted checking if disabled then return true
[06:34:25] <dd5> anyone for help with callback? :)
[06:34:39] <Cork> scar: check if its disabled in the handler, and exit early if it is
[06:35:36] <scar> aif($('.toggle').attr('disabled')) { return false; } ?
[06:35:41] <scar> if*

[06:39:02] <shwaiil> hi
[06:39:10] <Che-Anarc> aMoniker   I tried that but no luck and I think I cant remove this from parent and reinsret?.... I also toggle()  but no luck yet
[06:41:00] <shwaiil> Q: I want to access some data through a resftul api. So, /api/method/param1/param2 returns data. Using jQuery.get how to set the params properly without hard typing in the url ? $.get('api/method/', { 1 : param1, 2 : param2 }, fn) ? Tks for looking!
[06:42:59] <iurimm> anybody portuguese?
[06:43:56] <shwaiil> I can speak pt
[06:48:22] <shwaiil> Using jQuery.get() unless placing the param values directly in the url, it's not possible to use non named params ?
[06:48:59] <Cork> shwaiil: $.get(url, data <--
[06:50:04] <seutje> I can never get used to these shorthand methods
[06:50:19] <shwaiil> Cork: tks for looking! That will consume /api/method/param1/param2 by doing $.get('/api/method/', data, fn) ? I know about the data param, but only named params. Didnt tried []
[06:50:34] <Cork> uh, no
[06:50:37] <Cork> thats not params
[06:50:40] <seutje> those aren't query params
[06:50:48] <Cork> params is ?key=value&key=value
[06:51:16] <seutje> and there's no unnamed params there, just value-less keys
[06:51:19] <shwaiil> Cork: nice point, I see. I'm basically stripping data from the url with mod rewrite
[06:51:26] <shwaiil> seutje: I see
[06:51:29] <shwaiil> my bad
[06:51:56] <seutje> from the frontend, u can just address them as regular URLs
[06:52:11] <shwaiil> so, my solution would be $.get('/api/method/' + param1 + '/' + param2, fn)
[06:52:12] <seutje> server handles the translation with mod_rewrite
[06:52:17] <seutje> yesh
[06:52:26] <shwaiil> seutje: ok thanks guys! sorry about the trolling ;)
[06:52:46] <seutje> lol, hardly
[06:52:58] <seutje> this channels gets worse trolling that that, trust me
[06:53:07] <seutje> yeah, singular will do though
[07:14:49] <MaDiNfO_> hi
[07:16:35] <pachet> hi
[07:17:58] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: u there ?
[07:18:03] <Cork> ya
[07:18:31] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: so got my test.php
[07:18:32] <MaDiNfO_> working
[07:18:40] <MaDiNfO_> now on my script
[07:18:41] <MaDiNfO_> doesnt
[07:19:01] <MaDiNfO_> pastbin
[07:19:45] <MaDiNfO_> http://pastebin.com/hLCzNtGn
[07:19:46] <MaDiNfO_> check it out
[07:20:25] <MaDiNfO_> same thing... but nothing on boxes...
[07:20:48] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: check if your selectors find the elements your looking for
[07:20:57] <MaDiNfO_> how can i check that ?
[07:21:49] <jtbowlin> I'm using the tooltip plugin with an image as the tooltip, but on the middle of the left/right padding when showing an image, the color changes to white for like 100px or so.  Any ideas???
[07:22:18] <jtbowlin> i should say I've changed the background color to black, it was white by default
[07:22:33] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: console.log($('selector').length);
[07:23:18] <iateadonut> in firebug, in the javascript console, is there a way to assign an element clicked on by 'inspect' - assign it to a varialbe like 'this'?
[07:23:38] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: only thing i get on console
[07:23:39] <MaDiNfO_> is
[07:23:41] <MaDiNfO_> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[07:24:03] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: did you use your selector or the actual text "selector"?
[07:24:05] <topriddy> hi guys...i need an action button such that when clicked shows pops up a list of menu that could be different actions with icons just to the right of it. not sure exactly how to proceed?
[07:24:12] <MaDiNfO_> ?
[07:24:39] <BillCriswell> topology: Like a tooltip with buttons?
[07:25:01] <BillCriswell> You could jack these: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers
[07:25:49] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: did you took a look at the pastbin ?
[07:26:00] <Cork> MaDiNfO_: just skimmed it
[07:26:14] <MaDiNfO_> please take a look
[07:27:04] <jtbowlin> no-one has any advice on my issue?
[07:27:07] <seutje> Cork: this isn't milk!
[07:27:51] <BillCriswell> jtbowlin: Pretty impossible without something to look at.
[07:30:51] <ipot> hi
[07:31:21] <ipot> how do you replace an element with another by jquery
[07:31:51] <BillCriswell> jtbowlin: Just isolate it to jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com example. Half the time doing that tells you if it's the plugin or something in your parts of the code throwing the plugin off.
[07:32:01] <Cork> ?.replaceWith @ ipot
[07:32:02] <bot-t> ipot, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[07:32:33] <BillCriswell> ipot: While Cork is fast, google could have done it quicker. =p
[07:32:47] <seutje> he *is* fast, isn't he?
[07:32:53] <MaDiNfO_> Cork: found ittttttttt
[07:33:01] <MaDiNfO_> wierd char on the code
[07:33:04] <seutje> I don't even try to help when he's around, he'll beat me to it anyway
[07:33:32] <BillCriswell> seutje: I had "re" typed when I looked up and saw it sent 12 minutes ago.
[07:33:59] <seutje> so where were you looking at, hm? :P
[07:34:28] <BillCriswell> Where I was typing haha.
[07:42:55] <_mak> where can I find the docs about 'ui.combobox'?
[07:43:06] <ipot> billcriswell but the events on new replaced element dont work
[07:44:02] <BillCriswell> ipot: Well you're completely replacing the element. What's your main goal?
[07:44:14] <ph88> does somebody know a good jQuery scroller ? All i find are these sliders. But i want a continuous scroll: steady speed and then the end is reached it will just keep scrolling with the contect of the start
[07:44:46] <BillCriswell> <marquee> has some crazy legacy browser support.
[07:44:46] <ipot> yes its items of an unordered list
[07:45:09] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[07:45:10] <ipot> so i am setting the page size from a drop down list .. and getting data making an ajax call
[07:45:42] <ph88> this looks good  http://nettuts.s3.amazonaws.com/300_jquery/image%20Scroller/imageScroller.html   but there is a gap between images
[07:45:45] <masentinel900> http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/server_side/row_details.html
[07:45:49] <ipot> the new data tahts returned after successful ajax call is in html format string type
[07:46:04] <ipot> and its an underorded list again
[07:46:12] <ipot> unordered i mean
[07:46:29] <BillCriswell> ipot: Are you replacing the entire container with an updated container with more items?
[07:46:43] <masentinel900> Guys how can I load info from an php array in the hidden row?
[07:47:09] <Randomage> Hi, I'm tinkering a bit with the native drag and drop, and I managed to get chrome and opera to behave, but when I use the setDragImage with a transparent png, the ghost/handle/thingie has a white matte background instead of the image transparent one. IS this working as intended?
[07:49:15] <BillCriswell> ipot: Also, are all the list items needing the same click event? You could do  $('.container').on('click', '.item', function(){ // It doesn't matter when / how item was added, it'll run this code. });
[07:49:21] <ph88> found what i wanted: http://www.smoothdivscroll.com
[07:55:06] <seutje> when were issues turned off for jquery ui repo? o.O
[07:55:17] <Che-Anarc> I have .click() on .ui-icon that resides within a <li><a>  is there anyway I can do $(this).parent().remove() ?   trying to do delete for dynamic menu system.
[07:55:34] <seutje> pretty sure I was looking at one yesterday...
[07:55:47] <Che-Anarc> or maybe $(this).parent('li').remove() ?
[07:56:27] <BillCriswell> Che-Anarc: .closest('li')
[07:57:02] <BillCriswell> If you just want to go one up, .parents('li') would get ALL parent lis. .parent('li') would only get an immediate parent... I believe.
[07:57:32] <pachet> BillCriswell: that's correct
[07:58:26] <BillCriswell> It seems when I doubt myself I'm right, when I don't doubt myself I'm usually wrong.
[07:58:48] <pachet> that's how it goes :]
[08:00:28] <opie-wrk> IE8 requires me to use XDomainRequest, not sure what to check $.support to know when to use this?
[08:03:35] <opie-wrk> i guess i'll use !jQuery.support.cors
[08:03:59] <Che-Anarc> I tried $("#ul_layer .ui-icon").closest("li").remove();  but that seems to delete everthing... m LI's dont have an ID is that an issue?
[08:07:08] <didiergm> What would be the best option to add a clickable icon to an input field ?
[08:07:27] <Randomage> type?
[08:08:22] <didiergm> Randomage was it a question to me ?
[08:08:30] <Randomage> yes.
[08:09:55] <didiergm> randomage :) could be a stock Icon. I need to give users the hability on one field to click and get a popup window showing a summary of what was previoulsy entered in the form that field belong to
[08:10:12] <Randomage> What type of input are we tanking to.
[08:10:19] <Randomage> *talking about.
[08:10:30] <didiergm> randomage oops. text
[08:10:39] <didiergm> standard
[08:10:53] <lenswipe2> hey guys
[08:10:55] <lenswipe2> anyone around?
[08:10:56] <itatitat> guys, im receiving data in php from a shell, from an script running, I'd like to print that info in the html without waiting the finish of the process, in real time
[08:11:01] <itatitat> is possible'¿?
[08:11:35] <Randomage> add some padding where you want to create space for the icon, inject some dom element (possibly one that tabstops, button, a, input) that is positioned right onto the white space you created, bind the click event to it.
[08:12:03] <Randomage> itatitat, it is, in several ways.
[08:12:09] <itatitat> cool
[08:12:11] <Randomage> Websockets for instance.
[08:12:12] <itatitat> can you tell me any?
[08:12:21] <itatitat> is js?
[08:13:06] <didiergm> randomage that need to be done at page creation right ?
[08:13:09] <Randomage> it's a html5 feature.
[08:13:25] <Randomage> didiergm, uh?
[08:13:47] <Randomage> didiergm, you can inject the clickable icon whenever you want to.
[08:13:56] <Randomage> On hover, on focus, on page load
[08:14:03] <Randomage> in response to another button click.
[08:14:18] <didiergm> randomage w/o conflicting with whatever JQM adds to enhance the form fields ?
[08:14:21] <itatitat> Randomage: another way?
[08:15:03] <Randomage> itatitat, I'd have to study your situation more than I care to, but there's websockets, and there are fallback libraries.
[08:15:30] <itatitat> ok. thx a ñpt
[08:15:38] <itatitat> lot
[08:15:44] <Randomage> I'm not sure if ajax functions can interpret partial results.
[08:16:02] <Randomage> I think jquery doesn't fire a callback until it's done.
[08:16:16] <Randomage> try googling ajax data stream partial whatever
[08:16:29] <Randomage> I have no idea what JQM is.
[08:16:54] <didiergm> JQM Jquery mobile.
[08:18:11] <Randomage> I have no idea.
[08:18:26] <Randomage> But you're really just adding a dom node and setting a class with more padding.
[08:18:31] <Randomage> It's not rocket surgery.
[08:21:35] <pishposh> hey everyone!
[08:21:38] <masentinel900> Someone here could help me?
[08:22:16] <Randomage> Absolutely not.
[08:22:24] <Randomage> Considering we have no idea what your problem is.
[08:24:38] <vernonk> didiergm this would probably be a great use for JQM's icon buttons too.  Just inject it into the same fieldcontain div as the form input so you can position easily.
[08:25:36] <masentinel900> Guys !! just of to find a problem with my jquery script?
[08:26:24] <Randomage> masentinel900 don't make this a game of 20 questions, state your problem.
[08:26:45] <masentinel900> I have a paginate table with more than 200 records, I just view 10 per each page. I have a Jquery script that allow me open a modal window when onclick some table element
[08:27:41] <pishposh> i'm stumped trying to compare 'src' . I have a variable this_src = this_img.attr('src') . I have a window alert that reads out this_src . I'm putting two at a time into an array and then comparing array[0] with array[1] . I have another window alert to tell me if they're the same. Even when the window alerts for this_src read out the same value the other alert says they're not the same. Does the src somehow depend on path even though it
[08:27:42] <pishposh> doesn't print that way? http://jsfiddle.net/JZ9rA/1/
[08:27:46] <masentinel900> Just works with the first page of the table, If I go to page 2..3...4..5...... dont works
[08:27:56] <didiergm> vernonk, thanks mate, I'll give it a go ;) I was trying to "spy" on what JQM does for a search input type but can't find anything obvious ???
[08:28:33] <SCIF> Hello quys!
[08:28:43] <didiergm> vernonk, they are using an anchor for the clear field button, but for the serarch icon on the left ....  I am at loss
[08:28:43] <SCIF> * guys
[08:29:07] <SCIF> Can anyone help me to understand some select2 features?
[08:29:24] <vernonk> didiergm checking it out myself right now
[08:32:06] <didiergm> vernonk their trick is on the div surrounding the input & the A there is a class ui-icon_searchfield bet it is the cookie (for left-hand- side icon)
[08:33:17] <vernonk> didiergm interesting.
[08:34:47] <vernonk> didiergm looks like JQM is catching the `type="search"` and wrapping it in the necessary markup to have all the classes, etc.
[08:35:42] <didiergm> vernonk yes that's likely how they do it. I am currently looking at the css - thanks for your input
[08:36:55] <vernonk> didiergm sure is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/textinput.js#L67
[08:37:20] <vernonk> didiergm anytime. Love looking into stuff like that.
[08:38:38] <didiergm> vernonk I am guilty as not looking enough into JQM source code - thanks for the pointer ;)
[08:44:32] <dd5> hy guys, been here before, hope i'll have better luck now :) anyone got a minute for a callback help with some jquery plugin?
[08:46:19] <J4M> I don't know javascript so I'd like to ask for an answer to my stupid question. I'd like to edit this -> $('#video').html($('#video2').html()); so it could have text I'll specify in it. ie: -> $('#video').html("<div>"$('#video2').html()"</div>");
[08:48:45] <scar> J4M, that syntax is wrong
[08:49:35] <J4M> I know with javascript it's something like + 'texthere'
[08:51:28] <imsky> don't concatenate strings to create Dom nodes
[08:51:55] <crem> if .toggle() supposed to remember display property. I have an element which has display:inline-block; (both inline and in .css file) and toggling twice sets it to "block".
[08:52:02] <imsky> use .replace or .empty().append
[08:52:03] <crem> s/if/is
[08:52:21] <crem> s/ty./ty?/
[08:52:34] <imsky> crem: manage it manually
[08:54:03] <dd5> @scar you familiar with callbacks? :)
[09:02:24] <thin> I have a collection of checkboxes. How can I make them all "checked"
[09:02:51] <NoiseEee> collection.prop('checked',true);
[09:08:39] <dobalina> Anyone got any idea of how i could best solve this problem (i've detailed it here ->  http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2231421 ) would jquery/js be the way to go with something like this?
[09:08:42] <zarac> How can i clear the contents of the console buffer? (alerting does what i expect while console.log doesn't)
[09:09:42] <zulu-gula> I have mehtod $.get(some_url) and this url displays string in content
[09:10:05] <zulu-gula> when I log to console whole object returned by get I can see that result.responseText is expected string
[09:10:35] <zulu-gula> but when I try to log to console just result.responseText it is undefined
[09:11:02] <zulu-gula> if I log both result and result.responseText I have whole object with response text for the first one, and undefined value for second
[09:11:05] <BadCodSmell> use the debugger
[09:11:19] <BadCodSmell> luke
[09:11:56] <dougb> since $.browser is depreceated, is there a different way to call $.browser.msie?
[09:14:06] <scar> dd5, callbacks for what
[09:14:07] <snover> dougb: it is deprecated because if you use it, you’re doing it wrong.
[09:15:01] <dd5> i'm trying to combine quicksand plugin and lazy loader
[09:15:20] <dd5> and i'm stuck with callback for them to work properly.
[09:15:45] <dd5> quicksand: http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[09:16:23] <dd5> would like to add lazy loader couse i'll have 30+ images
[09:17:52] <dd5> it's working ok at first page load, all images show and lazy loader works. But problem occurs when i try to filter the images, they become blank until i move the mouse (up/down), then images load again
[09:18:54] <dd5> i guess it has to do something with a callback or something, to prevent lazyloader to be active again on those images
[09:30:22] <scar> dd5, i am not familiar with lazy loade. do u have a url?
[09:35:45] <my-cool-nickname> 1 OP on 945 users. That's weird.
[09:36:11] <scar> if you count chanserv as an op....
[09:36:12] <scar> lol
[09:36:12] <Che-Anarc> Is there any easy / lazy way of reverting a sortable.() back to an original state?
[09:36:40] <sacho> i dont think so
[09:36:42] <scar> Che-Anarc, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10217490/reset-positions-from-jquery-ui-sortable
[09:36:48] <scar> you can store the initial state ,maybe?
[09:37:20] <Che-Anarc> scar  sure - thanks for the link - see I can replicate someone else's hardwork quickly :-p
[09:37:50] <sacho> if the sortables aren't modified, saving the initial state is a great solution
[09:38:13] <dd5> @scar sure: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[09:39:33] <dd5> this is demo (with fade): http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/enabled_fadein.html
[09:39:54] <dd5> i'm using this with quicksand, which sorts images
[09:40:21] <scar> dd5, doesnt look like they have callback options for that
[09:40:30] <scar> dd5, the callback abilities would be outlined in the doc.
[09:41:02] <scar> dd5, check this though: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11398005/jquery-lazyload-callback
[09:42:31] <jokke> hello! Can i somehow make lightbox use a thumbnail i provide?
[09:42:38] <dd5> scar thx for the link
[09:43:52] <jokke> or is there a script that would do that? I have a rails app where i have images in three different sizes. In a slideshow i wrote i want the user to be able to enlarge the image with a mouseclick just like lightbox does it
[09:46:02] <anew> hey guys stupid question, but is it frowned upon to put php inside javascript ?
[09:46:08] <anew> well any server side language ...
[09:47:31] <thin> If I do $('td.label').first().parent().data() I get my data.
[09:48:19] <thin> but if I instead traverse from a checkbox in that table and up to the same parent table row I don't get any data
[09:48:26] <thin> any idea why?
[09:52:03] <bluesm> Is there a way
[09:52:12] <bluesm> to make Jquery UI slider in html ?
[09:52:39] <bluesm> I mean to don't have to make it create it on client side
[09:53:59] <shoky> `demo @ thin
[09:53:59] <b-ot> thin: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:54:08] <bluesm> (I have to make it fadeIn And FadeOut  and this would make my code cleaner.
[09:54:09] <shoky> bluesm: what?
[09:54:56] <bluesm> shoky:  To make the particlar div slider without having creating object in javascript.
[09:55:06] <bluesm> shoky:  I have several hidden sliders..
[09:55:14] <shoky> and have it work?
[09:55:28] <shoky> without javascript?
[09:55:33] <bluesm> shoky:  That I make the visible or not (depending on user action)
[09:55:44] <bluesm> shoky:  Right.
[09:56:04] <shoky> short answer: no
[09:56:16] <bluesm> shoky: But I have to make from every div slider...
[09:56:18] <shoky> or maybe i dont understand what you mean at all..
[09:56:23] <bluesm> shoky: On the beginning.
[09:56:46] <shoky> make a jsfiddle, maybe i'll understand..
[09:56:51] <ladislaw> any tutorial about popup windows?
[09:59:28] <bluesm> shoky: Ok. I think that what I could do is not to "create" all the sliders on the beginning.. But insert it and remove it.
[09:59:55] <shoky> shrugs
[09:59:55] <b-ot> shoky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[10:22:54] <djQuery> M4d3L-Rabbit, not in particular
[10:25:35] <tubbo> is there a way i can 'test' whether a jQuery object has some element bound to it?
[10:25:50] <bluesm> djQuery: But I will return only 1 element.
[10:25:58] <tubbo> so lets say i did $('#el').on('click', .., is there a way to find all elements with 'click' bound to them?
[10:26:34] <djQuery> tubbo, what do you want to do with them after you have found them?
[10:27:24] <djQuery> tubbo, espcialy seeing as how there $('#el').on('click', 'childfilter', function(){});
[10:28:02] <djQuery> tubbo, the click is actualy on the #el   but realy affects the child elements not #el it self
[10:31:42] <djQuery> so anyone see anything wrong with this template? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/JfVr6/
[10:32:34] <tubbo> i'm just curious, doing some testing to try to catch this dumbass bug

[10:36:58] <topriddy1> is this the right place to ask?
[10:37:13] <Tsd_> mydomain.com#page?id=1
[10:37:19] <Tsd_> doesn't work
[10:37:56] <Tsd_> @topriddy1 what do you want to di?
[10:38:26] <j_wright> shouldn't it be the other way round?
[10:38:39] <j_wright> mydomain.com?id=1#page

[11:40:22] <bluesm> And keydown don't take "first" last value
[11:40:40] <PatrickMello> iurimm, portuguese from portugal, portuguese from brazil or portuguese on general? ;)
[11:40:45] <bluesm> eddiemonge: Key down fire before it insert something.
[11:40:55] <anew> what is portuguese on general ?
[11:41:23] <eddiemonge> bluesm: how is keyup too late then? what is it you are looking to do?

[11:43:15] <iurimm> ahahaha ok
[11:43:23] <bluesm> eddiemonge:  It's to late.
[11:43:28] <eddiemonge> how so?
[11:43:37] <bluesm> eddiemonge:  User should instantly view the "changes"
[11:43:45] <bluesm> eddiemonge:  not after key is "up"

[11:52:32] <abes> Is this the right spot to ask some foundation questions?
[11:52:38] <myosotis> I want to construct a dom tree via jquery and append it to the dom somewhere. Can somebody point me at the docs that descript creating dom elements?
[11:53:22] <bluesm> eddiemonge: Not.
[11:53:37] <sacho> you can use $() to create elements
[11:53:41] <bluesm> eddiemonge:  Press long key, then you will have "lag" in inserting :)
[11:53:48] <myosotis> yes, I would like to find the docs that describe that.
[11:53:51] <sacho> !api jquery
[11:53:52] <b-ot> sacho: jQuery(): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[11:54:25] <eddiemonge> donics: where you looking for something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/j8rEk/1/
[11:54:37] <myosotis> I know that jQuery(htmlstring) will do it. I'm curious about the specifics, for example, is it better to include the class="whatever" inside the htmlstring, or use addClass on the constructed element, etc...
[11:54:40] <eddiemonge> abes: which foundation?
[11:55:23] <abes> eddiemonge: 4
[11:55:52] <sacho> myosotis, if you're talking about preference, I prefer to load html snippets from the server or if creating them is really needed, using document.createElement piece by piece
[11:56:34] <abes> eddiemonge: I have a predefined CSS that has classes for me to use to style my elements, but when I apply these classes to my <li>s and <ul>s the functionality is broken, so what I am trying to understand is how does class="anything" relate to styling and to functionality in Foundation and how can I apply a different class name to an element that has the right styling without breaking the
[11:56:34] <abes> functionality
[11:56:45] <bluesm> eddiemonge:  All I can come up with is :  http://jsfiddle.net/9FfHD/1/
[11:56:49] <myosotis> thanks, I think I found the docs I was looking for finally
[11:57:05] <sacho> generally, adding the classes later is more work than before.
[11:57:28] <eddiemonge> abes: oh you mean css foundation
[11:57:45] <abes> eddiemonge: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/top-bar.html
[11:59:40] <donics> eddiemonge: yes, actually that works. would you call that a workaround or was I using destroy incorrectly? The only thing i would need is to reattach later potentially
[11:59:57] <eddiemonge> bluesm: is it super important that the other fields get the value instantly?
[12:00:23] <eddiemonge> donics: i feel like it might have targeted all the children when it was destroyed but not sure
[12:00:45] <bluesm> eddiemonge: Maybe not. But i just make "super small thing" And want to make it super "responsive" and intuitive :)
[12:01:22] <microhxo> Guys, im attaching to a Dropdown .change event using jquery, but the HTML for that dropdown exists in a partial view which gets replaced with an updated partial view containing the same structure.

[12:21:22] <Yatekii> shoky I just put the aditional header info in my php and it did not change shit ..
[12:21:32] <Yatekii> eddiemonge: tks, I'll take a look at it :)
[12:22:33] <shoky> Yatekii:  why are you doing "return data"
[12:22:39] <shoky> Yatekii: do what the guy told you to do
[12:23:11] <shoky> Yatekii:  and your response should look like:  ["Test","Test2"]
[12:23:24] <Yatekii> ah '' is not allowed?
[12:23:27] <shoky> no
[12:25:03] <Yatekii> uhh

[12:32:37] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone are there good plugins to create multiple collapse / expand states?
[12:37:13] <donics> djQuery eddiemonge appears to be a known issue: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8344 is there anything I can do to move it along faster?
[12:37:31] <B|aster> djQuery: thanks
[12:37:31] <donics> it's tagged as haspatch, not sure what that means
[12:37:40] <B|aster> is there also an asynchronous callback appraoch?
[12:38:04] <eddiemonge> donics: ask in #jquery-dev
[12:38:12] <donics> sure, thanks again guys!
[12:38:29] <PhanLord> can i download into my script a file from ftp ?
[12:38:36] <PhanLord> qith jquery ?
[12:38:52] <NoiseEee> PhanLord: no
[12:42:35] <hip2p> Is there a way to select elements based on a part of a class? For example, I have classes that look like f1, f2, f3, f4, f5. Is there a way to make a generic selector like $('.f').click() and then get the number part after?
[12:42:45] <gotwig> dblosevn: hey there
[12:42:54] <gotwig> dblosevn: nice to see you, how its going
[12:43:17] <shoky> hip2p: yes but it's not recommended
[12:44:05] <B|aster> hip2p:  Maybe assign class="f" id="1" ...etc
[12:44:29] <shoky> hip2p: better to have class="f" and select them all, then filter, but depends on what your usecase is exactly
[12:44:35] <shoky> not id="1"
[12:44:38] <shoky> maybe data-id="1"
[12:45:27] <hip2p> The issue I'm having is that I have mouseover and mouseout functions to trigger a popover. They generally work because I created a generic class 'f' that's selected. After selection, I split the classes until I find 'f-type1' and go from there. The problem is that for some reason on the mouseout, if I move the mouse too quickly, the popover claims it can't destroy an undefined popover.
[12:45:29] <roger_padactor> hello.. so I do console.log($(this).attr('class'))   where this is an a tag  and it spits out "class1 class2 class3"  but when I do  console.log($(this).hasClass('class3')) I get false… WHY?
[12:45:52] <masentinel900> Guys!!, Someone here has experience working with datatables plugin for jquery?
[12:45:56] <shoky> `demo @ hip2p
[12:45:57] <b-ot> hip2p: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:47:06] <shoky> roger_padactor ^^
[12:47:30] <gotwig> dblosevn: are you there?
[12:47:36] <gotwig> dblosevn: ping me please if you are there
[12:53:08] <roger_padactor> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/L6Zdx/
[12:53:41] <shoky> roger_padactor: what's the problem?
[12:54:07] <roger_padactor> hasClass("class3") returns false
[12:54:14] <shoky> right, it's supposed to
[12:54:20] <shoky> you didn't even console.log anything..
[12:54:23] <roger_padactor> even though its been added?
[12:54:28] <shoky> check yourself
[12:54:42] <roger_padactor> oh jesus!
[12:54:57] <roger_padactor> anyways…
[12:55:10] <shoky> ;p
[12:55:14] <roger_padactor> it still doesn't work for me on my site.  odd
[12:55:14] <deed02392> hi all I've got the deferred.done function running when an ajax call comes back... this ajax call is made on the click event of an element - how should I pass that element on to the .done() handler so it can modify the element?
[12:55:54] <shoky> deed02392: can you put it in a fiddle
[12:56:32] <deed02392> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/DkBPy/
[12:57:19] <roger_padactor> shoky:   console.log($(this).attr("class"),$(this).hasClass("paypal"));  ->  pay-chekerz rpay-chekerz paypall act false
[12:57:31] <hip2p> Ok, I'm not sure why popover isn't working, but this is basically how my code looks. The problem comes when I get to mouseout to destroy the popover. In my code, if I mouseout very quickly, I get an error saying it cannot destroy undefined. If I go slowly, I never get the error. http://jsfiddle.net/hQKNu/3/
[12:57:33] <roger_padactor> riddle me that
[12:57:49] <shoky> deed02392: well, you're already accessing the clicked button just fine, no?
[12:58:00] <shoky> deed02392: with var elem = jQuery(this)
[12:58:20] <deed02392> yea, but i wasn't sure if that would be in the namespace of the deferred fuinction?
[12:58:35] <shoky> roger_padactor: did you paste the actual string?
[12:58:43] <deed02392> i only just added that at a guess, then i thought i should check here before trying it
[12:58:44] <shoky> roger_padactor: and if so, are you serious? ;p
[12:59:21] <roger_padactor> whats wrong with pasting my console log...
[12:59:22] <shoky> deed02392: that should work fine
[12:59:31] <shoky> roger_padactor:  check yourself :\
[12:59:49] <deed02392> thanks shoky
[13:00:31] <roger_padactor> shoky:  i think I'm going to kill myself.
[13:00:44] <shoky> now now
[13:01:07] <shoky> valuable lesson ;p
[13:01:49] <mattaf123> ok i'm using jQuery ui to do an "addClass" animation. during this, i need a custom animate() method to run as well. currently they run sequentially, how can i combine them? addClass() is for some styling, and animate() is for the position.
[13:03:40] <shoky> mattaf123:  they should already be in parallel, addClass is instantaneous.. unless you're talking about css transitions.. in which case it'd still run in parallel
[13:04:14] <shoky> or maybe i dunno what you mean buy an addClass animation
[13:04:59] <mattaf123> shoky: in query ui, you can have an addclass() method (or switchClass() or removeClass()) that calculates the animation and takes care of it. no css transitions needed.
[13:05:06] <mattaf123> * jquery ui *
[13:05:32] <shoky> oh, forgot about that
[13:07:01] <masentinel900> Someone here?
[13:07:03] <masentinel900> plz!!
[13:07:16] <masentinel900> table tools is not working!!

[13:09:53] <gotwig> dblosevn: I've got some problems with your code, that you wrote for me to serialize the grid
[13:10:09] <gotwig> dblosevn: It works fine for when dragging starts, but I need a few more usecases
[13:10:20] <gotwig> *stops
[13:10:57] <gotwig> dblosevn: how can I properly serialize the data? You see my other usecases as well in my file: https://github.com/gotwig/draganddrool/blob/master/project.php
[13:11:31] <gotwig> currently it works somehow only for the second action, meaning if a user e.g resizes a box, it doesnt work for the first, if he resizes a second box, the action for the first box gets send, but not for the second
[13:11:44] <gotwig> its clientside, jQuery/Javascript problem I guess
[13:12:03] <shoky> mattaf123:  one easy way would be to put queue:false on the .animate()  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Kjzde/1/
[13:13:00] <mattaf123> shoky: ah perfect, thanks
[13:19:22] <pishposh> does an 'src' obtained through attr() somehow contain the path? i'm trying to compare 2 src and i know from window alerts that they are the same but my code doesn't recognize that they're equal. please help. I'm baffled. http://jsfiddle.net/JZ9rA/1/
[13:20:25] <thin> Hi. Could somene explain jquery's ajax behaviour to me regarding passing data as {} vs []?
[13:20:30] <thin> In this example code: http://pastie.org/pastes/6642737/text
[13:20:48] <thin> i have 2 copies of the same function. There is only 1 difference between the 2 (highlighted line)
[13:21:13] <thin> the first one works as needed. the 2nd one does something different that doesn't match what I need.
[13:21:25] <thin> I included the response from my server for both methods below the code.
[13:21:30] <shoky> pishposh: first of all, dont alert, use console.log
[13:21:43] <thin> the only difference is 1 has {} and the other has []
[13:22:14] <eddiemonge> pishposh: what does     console.log( temp_pusher[0], this_src) give you?
[13:22:46] <pishposh> eddiemonge: 1 sec
[13:23:09] <say2joe> you should send post data as an object… not array. though you could do something like { myValues: [arrayData] }
[13:23:43] <shoky> thin: if you pass an array it needs to be of objects that have 'name' and 'value'. see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[13:23:47] <shoky> thin:  and [] is an array
[13:23:51] <say2joe> you could also look into serializeArray method
[13:24:11] <deed02392> it worked shoky - so how come var elem was visible to the deferred function?
[13:24:25] <shoky> deed02392:  that's how javascript works
[13:24:26] <thin> serialize array doesn't work with the way I'm defining the values in newdata[i] within the for loop
[13:24:38] <shoky> deed02392:  the inner function is what's called a closure
[13:24:49] <thin> my code works I just need to know what the {} [] difference was
[13:25:00] <deed02392> even though it's a lambda function?
[13:25:29] <thin> because it drove my mad
[13:25:32] <shoky> deed02392: irregardless
[13:25:47] <shoky> regardless :\
[13:25:50] <deed02392> oooh. so every subsequent enclsoure inherits all the vars
[13:25:54] <pishposh> eddiemonge: wow, uuh: "[img.deep_img, prevObject: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[16], context: document, selector: ".deep_img.filter(function () {↵ for ( i = 0, l … this ) ) {↵ return true;↵					}↵				}↵	})", constructor: function, init: function…]
[13:25:55] <deed02392> of the parent namespace?
[13:26:23] <shoky> deed02392: yah i think you could say that
[13:26:26] <eddiemonge> pishposh: so not exactly what you want
[13:27:02] <deed02392> haha. i expect there's a better way of describing it but for now that seems to be true
[13:27:11] <deed02392> i'll stay suspicious of that working every time then
[13:27:22] <shoky> read about closures ;p
[13:27:31] <pishposh> eddiemonge: not really sure what that is. how do i get object.src = "images/1.jpg" ??
[13:27:36] <deed02392> will do :)
[13:27:39] <thin> so even if the structure and key within the object & within the array are identical
[13:27:50] <thin> the fact that one is an array will cause the post params to be built differently?
[13:28:12] <deed02392> shoky, here's a good definition: "Whenever you see the function keyword within another function, the inner function has access to variables in the outer function."
[13:28:22] <eddiemonge> pishposh: sounds like your first thing is a jquery object and not actually the string for src
[13:28:55] <shoky> thin: yes
[13:29:05] <pishposh> eddiemonge: so maybe attr() is the wrong way to go?
[13:29:39] <eddiemonge> pishposh: what does this give you; http://jsfiddle.net/JZ9rA/2/
[13:29:40] <thin> shoky: useful addition to that, click event handlers replace the original `this` with the element that was clicked. To keep a refernce to the original objects `this` you can define that=this and from within event handlers you can use `that` to call other methods from the main object while `this` is the clicked event element.
[13:29:53] <shoky> deed02392: sounds good
[13:30:16] <shoky> thin: uhh.. thanks, i know ;p
[13:34:11] <pishposh> eddiemonge: won't go. "object has no method 'attar'"
[13:34:22] <shoky> pfahaa..
[13:35:25] <eddiemonge> attar? or attr?
[13:35:27] <eddiemonge> pishposh
[13:35:35] <eddiemonge> do you have this up somewhere?
[13:35:46] <pishposh> eddiemonge: sorry attr
[13:36:16] <pishposh> eddiemonge: github. one sec
[13:40:43] <pishposh> eddiemonge: https://github.com/desmondrawls/Game_Memory/blob/master/index.html
[13:49:18] <pishposh> eddiemonge: live - www.mycodinghoneymoon.dreamhosters.com
[13:51:49] <jedimind> wat is that
[13:52:17] <tw2113> it's a url
[13:53:05] <eddiemonge> pishposh: i think you need to rethink things a bit
[13:53:35] <pishposh> eddiemonge: how so?
[13:54:07] <jedimind> well, that was the wrong button
[13:54:14] <eddiemonge> what is this for anyway? a project, work or for fun?
[13:54:25] <pishposh> eddiemonge: fun/learning
[13:55:05] <pishposh> eddiemonge: so i don't really care if its not lean and mean i just want it to work
[13:56:24] <eddiemonge> pishposh: you should be checking the binding to the cards themselves, or more accurately delegating the event handlers
[13:57:36] <pishposh> eddiemonge: but won't i still have the same problem when its time to compare the two images? i need to get at the src somehow
[13:59:01] <eddiemonge> $(this).find($('.deep_img')) would be better as $(this).find('.deep_img')
[14:00:27] <eddiemonge> but if thats the actual code then src should work
[14:03:01] <pishposh> eddiemonge: you mean if i drop the $ then i should be able to compare src no problem?
[14:03:25] <Che-Anarc> How can I do $("#layer li") = old_oder; <-- get invalid left-assignment.
[14:03:54] <tw2113> you're trying to assign old_oder to a selector?
[14:05:53] <Che-Anarc> tw2113  its bind to a key... I 1st do: order = $( "#layer li" ); ... then prior to : $("#layer").sortable("cancel");  the above... but cancel doest seem to position it back correctly thus my quest  :-)
[14:22:20] <pishposh> : eddiemonge: check out the console log on this one www.mycodinghoneymoon.dreamhosters.com
[14:26:04] <Che-Anarc> http://jsfiddle.net/86qxp/12/  I have this sortable but trying to restore order based on cancel action but I think I am going about it wrongly via: $( "#sortable li" ) = order;
[14:26:21] <rainabba> I'm trying to do an OR (select elements matching either ID pattern but can't figure the syntax out. Help?  :)   Here's what I have so far: $('input[id$=_UpdateButton] input[id$=_CancelButton]')
[14:27:20] <rainabba> HA!
[14:27:39] <rainabba> nm :)   $('input[id$=_UpdateButton],input[id$=_CancelButton]')  I knew it had to be simple and I was close.
[14:42:02] <streever> hi all! is this a good place to ask about a jquery based slider I found on the web?
[14:44:56] <streever> (basically I'm trying to figure out how to use a "method call"
[14:45:51] <shoky> streever: ask.. if someone feels like helping they will
[14:46:20] <streever> thanks shoky, wanted to make sure it was ok!
[14:47:32] <streever> I'm using the SlidesJS (v3) jquery module to do a simple fade slideshow. The author has included functionality to let me "advance" The slides in a manual link, but I'm not sure how to implement it. I have a small example line of code that looks like this: $("#slideshow").slidesjs("goto", intValue);
[14:47:44] <streever> I'm not sure how to use that: Do I write a function? Or do I put it into an a href?
[14:50:41] <shoky> streever: where do you see a "goto" method?
[14:50:56] <streever> it is in a big chunk of code, I'll paste it in fiddle
[14:51:34] <streever> http://jsfiddle.net/UeFkE/
[14:51:38] <shoky> thought you said its included in the plugin
[14:52:00] <shoky> huh, what is that...
[14:52:06] <streever> One of the plugin devs gave it to me, it was in version 2, but they didn't include it in version 3
[14:52:16] <streever> so they told me to just paste it at the bottom of the file
[14:52:23] <shoky> what does it have to do with slidesjs..
[14:52:45] <shoky> and i'll ask again.. where do you see a "goto" method?
[14:52:54] <streever> sorry, that is what they called it:
[14:53:04] <streever> they told me to replace the last few lines of it with these,
[14:53:06] <streever> and said,
[14:53:09] <shoky> why?
[14:53:14] <streever> "now you can call the goto method directly with an argument (slide number as integer), eg."
[14:53:31] <streever> the goal is to link directly to a slide with a manual link
[14:54:23] <streever> I asked in the google group, and was told to paste that in, and given the bit of advice
[14:54:37] <streever> I asked a follow-up question but haven't heard anything, so I wanted to check here if there was some basic tutorial or something I should read
[14:55:59] <shoky> a basic tutorial on how to modify SlidesJS source code?
[14:56:09] <rainabba> Anyone know of a library/module/snippet that will let me queue up json calls, set a timeout, and fire a callback if the timeout is met (because the calls weren't successful) or something along those lines? I have a UI that will recieve a lot of interaction and I want to send updates in the background to keep the UI flowing but I want a robust way to deal with a situation where the user looses
[14:56:09] <rainabba> connectivity, the server becomes unresponsive, etc..
[14:58:55] <sacho> !api ajax @ rainabba
[14:58:55] <b-ot> rainabba: No matches.
[14:59:00] * sacho sighs
[14:59:01] <sacho> !api ajax
[14:59:02] <b-ot> sacho: No matches.
[14:59:21] <sacho> well that's just dandy.
[14:59:23] <sacho> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:59:25] <rainabba> Here's what I have so far but it's getting pretty daunting: http://pastebin.com/dEdqZHAZ
[14:59:29] <sacho> you'll find what you asked for.
[15:01:03] <rainabba> Heh, didn't realize it was quite that robust. I know it and intended on using it for my actual calls, but wanted to wrap it up nice and tidy.
[15:02:07] <rainabba> There's nothing to make it try multiple times though so I'd need to wrap in in a setTimeout() with a counter right? It has a timeout but that's only for a single request?
[15:02:46] <rainabba> .... which pretty much brings me back to where I was :)
[15:04:01] <sacho> why would you need to wrap it in a timeout?
[15:07:27] <averyvery> darkmutt: try bool && dostuff();
[15:10:22] <pishposh> what's the best way to create a pause halfway through an on click function??
[15:12:40] <shoky> pishposh: what?
[15:13:39] <sacho> wrap the rest of the code in a function, call it later via a timeout
[15:13:46] <pishposh> shoky: check this out: www.mycodinghoneymoon.dreamhosters.com
[15:14:04] <pishposh> shoky: when you disable the windows you'll see what i mean
[15:14:07] <bergamot_> if opt.text has a <span>blahblah</span in it, why does $('<option value="' + opt.id + '">' + opt.text + '</option>').appendTo(select); remove it? does appendTo automatically remove html tags? how can I keep html tags and inline stuff on opt.text?
[15:14:35] <shoky> pishposh: huh??
[15:14:58] <pishposh> sacho: makes sense
[15:15:00] <averyvery> bergamot - could be that spans are not allowed in options
[15:15:12] <pishposh> shoky: huh?? what? be more specific
[15:15:16] <bergamot_> averyvery I can do it manally in the console, and it works
[15:15:19] <shoky> you be more specific...
[15:15:32] <averyvery> oh, huh....
[15:15:36] <pishposh> shoky: did you try disabling the alerts on that page?
[15:15:42] <shoky> pishposh: disabling alerts? wtf?
[15:16:17] <averyvery> can you just not pass nested tags into $()? that would make sense
[15:16:26] <averyvery> maybe not
[15:16:28] <pishposh> shoky: did you go to the page? sorry needs some instruction. hit reset then click the cards
[15:16:38] <sacho> averyvery, you can
[15:16:47] <shoky> pishposh: yes i went to the page
[15:17:13] <pishposh> shoky: sorry i forgot to mention hit reset and then click the playing cards
[15:17:18] <shoky> pishposh: did it.
[15:17:27] <shoky> i see alerts..
[15:17:38] <shoky> even though you've already been told not to use them
[15:18:07] <pishposh> shoky: then disable the windows and you'll see that when two cards are different they immediately flip back over before you can see whats there
[15:18:12] <shoky> wtf is disable the windows
[15:18:16] <pishposh> shoky: i'm using them in place of pauses now
[15:18:24] <shoky> pishposh: DONT
[15:18:26] <pishposh> shoky: there are console.logs too
[15:18:38] <shoky> dont use alerts for anything :\
[15:18:44] <pishposh> shoky: its for demonstration purposes so you can see what's going on
[15:18:48] <shoky> then , come and ask your question again
[15:18:59] <shoky> i can see console logs, you dont need to alert
[15:19:21] <shoky> anyway ... wtf is disable the windows
[15:19:23] <sadtaco> I have an long serious of numbers, and these get translated into rows and columns.  For example I have column rows, and I have the number 45(starting at 0).  That means 3rd row, 6th over.  But what's the formula to actually figure out how many sets of 20 I need to subtract for the column, and to figure how many rows down I went?
[15:19:23] <sadtaco> Is there no formula and I just need to loop?
[15:19:38] <pishposh> shoky: the alert allows the card to flip over so you can see how its supposed to be. it works.
[15:21:08] <averyvery> bergamot: http://jsfiddle.net/YY22V/ looks like it works with the div, not with the option
[15:21:09] <shoky> pishposh: you don't pause stuff. if you want something to happen in X seconds, use setTimeout with X seconds
[15:21:12] <averyvery> hmm
[15:21:23] <pishposh> shoky: cool
[15:25:24] <sadtaco> Oh.  % is divide and returns remainder.
[15:26:27] <sadtaco> I think plugins aren't usually supported here, unless it's jquery ui
[15:32:36] <basiclaser> hey guys can anyone point me to a tutorial which explains how to take input value and turn it into a variable? thanks
[15:34:47] <relipse> how can i check if all elements hasClass('foo') ?
[15:35:02] <relipse> $('.myclass').hasClass('foo')???
[15:35:11] <relipse> what if 1 doesn't?
[15:36:25] <Che-Anarc> Is there no way i can do $("#layer li") = existing_object  ?
[15:37:05] <Che-Anarc> Spending forever on a simple re-order problem... I have original orders and want to resort back based on a cancel action.
[15:38:32] <sacho> relipse, !$('.myclass').not('.foo').length
[15:39:19] <sacho> I suppose you could straight up use a not filter, e.g. $('.myclass:not(.foo)')
[15:49:06] <anew> how can i load a div specifically after another div is loaded in the dom
[15:51:31] <averyvery> loaded meaning appended>
[15:53:46] <shoky> Che-Anarc:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pNCqU/
[16:13:28] <vrs> when I iterate over a bunch of elements, I get raw elements (I think) and not jquery objects. should I jquery() those elements or is there a built-in function that does that automatically? Or am I totally wrong?
[16:13:54] <sacho> depends what you want to achieve.
[16:14:47] <vrs> I'm passing them to a function and I want to call .find() on them
[16:15:16] <vrs> so I need jquery extended ones
[16:17:02] <averyvery> you mean your 'this' is a raw DOM element inside the loop>
[16:18:47] <averyvery> usually, you just do $(this) in that case
[16:19:02] <vrs> ok thanks, that's what I needed to know
[16:32:55] <vrs> .each gives index first and element second... that's something I'll need to get used to
[16:34:14] <ipengineer> Can someone help me determine why my json is not being encoded correctly it is just a random bunch of strings and numbers.. http://paste.laravel.com/l0o
[16:35:41] <portishead> hey guys if I want to address a <dd> through an event of clicking a link in that tag how do I do that?
[16:36:58] <sacho> ipengineer, that's not what contentType is for, and also, the data you are sending is bogus.
[16:37:10] <sacho> why are you stringifying those arrays before passing them?
[16:37:41] <ipengineer> sacho: I am not calling those anymore. I was just trying that. I am calling hardwareModel instead of hardawrePayload
[16:37:49] <sacho> ipengineer, the data parameter is already serialized properly when it's a plain object
[16:38:21] <ipengineer> Ok.. so do I need to drop the contentType and just pass url, type and data?
[16:38:27] <sacho> yes
[16:41:00] <ipengineer> sacho: So if I do data:JSON.stringify(hardwareModel) I get a json array if I don't then I get: hardware%5B0%5D%5BhardwareName%5D=1&hardware%5B0%5D%5BhardwareQuantity%5D=&hardware%5B0%5D%5BhardwareBYOD%5D=
[16:42:41] <sacho> "I get"?
[16:43:27] <ipengineer> sacho: A long string of text
[16:43:55] <sacho> what do you mean by "I get"\
[16:44:53] <ipengineer> sacho: Im sorry.. When I post I am looking in my browsers console. I am looking at the POST source and if I stringily I am sending a json object. If I don't I am sending that long string of text.
[16:45:05] <sacho> Of course.
[16:45:13] <sacho> That's url encoded form data.
[16:46:17] <sacho> If your application expects something else, then perhaps that's not what you want.
[16:46:26] <sacho> (server-side application, that is)
[16:47:30] <ipengineer> On the server side I am doing a json_decode
[16:47:39] <sacho> on what?
[16:48:05] <sacho> It seems you're having problems establishing the protocol of communication between your client and server.
[16:48:33] <sacho> What does your server expect as post data?
[16:51:04] <ipengineer> I don't know… here is what I know. If I use JSON.stringify I can see the array in my browser console and my php app recognizes that. Where I am having the problem is I want to send two arrays. A service and a hardware array so I can work with them independently. Sorry.. i am new to JS/JSON..
[16:51:55] <ipengineer> i am using laravel and they have a method called Input::json that I get I can then loop through this data and insert into db or whatever else I need to do with it. Again the problem is I am wanting two arrays so I can do this independently
[16:53:39] <sacho> put them in an object
[16:54:01] <sacho> stringify { array1: [...], array2: [...] }
[16:54:24] <sacho> I see what you mean, then the contentType might actually be correct(or not matter at all, depending on what your framework does)
[16:55:59] <sacho> what your framework seems to expect is a json-encoded string in post data, so obviously you'd need to provide such(via stringify). The "default" way of serializing $.ajax() data encodes it as "form data" - you may have worked with it if you've used $_POST['xyz'] in php, and so on.
[16:56:50] <ipengineer> OK makes sense.
[16:56:58] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take five
[16:57:28] <ipengineer> Thank you for your help

[17:24:56] <lenswipee> tw2113: been busy these past couple of days :)
[17:25:06] <tw2113> good
[17:25:21] <lenswipee> tw2113: i mean you since you haven't been in #wordpress

[17:49:39] <MistuhKurtz> how can I remove a style that was set with javascript?
[17:50:40] <LocalPCGuy> MistuhKurtz, .attr('styleName', '')
[17:50:55] <MistuhKurtz> pscht, but that's too easy :P
[17:50:57] <MistuhKurtz> thanks LocalPCGuy
[17:51:01] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[17:51:02] <LocalPCGuy> np
[17:51:41] <LocalPCGuy> if you want to remove the entire style attribute you can use removeAttr('style')
[18:20:44] <sully_> Hey folks. I'm looking at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ and not setting jsonpCallback, so the function creates a callback function name for me. I know I can set that function name but I'm curious, how would I use the random function?
[18:22:48] <Capt_Blackwood> hello.
[18:23:00] <Capt_Blackwood> anybody know how to get the jquery video backgrounds to work?
[18:26:25] <Capt_Blackwood> anybody?
[18:28:39] * crickets` chirps
[18:30:31] <Capt_Blackwood> ???
[18:30:36] <Andrew_R> Capt_Blackwood: I haven't used it. Have you looked at http://georgepaterson.github.com/jquery-videobackground/ ?
[18:30:46] <Capt_Blackwood> I did, couldn't get that to work
[18:30:47] <lenswipee> hi, how do you do the click on something and you get a circle spinning around telling you to wait that it's loading up in jquery? what is this technology called?
[18:31:23] <tw2113> loader image?
[18:31:37] <tw2113> Capt_Blackwood, did you check for any errors in console?
[18:31:38] <LocalPCGuy> lenswipee on click you show the loader, and then once your action completes, hide it
[18:31:45] <Andrew_R> spinner image?
[18:32:14] <lenswipee> LocalPCGuy: Bingo! where do I get this loader?
[18:32:21] <Capt_Blackwood> ncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'videoBG'  <<<<
[18:32:30] <Capt_Blackwood> Uncaught*
[18:32:39] <LocalPCGuy> http://www.ajaxload.info/
[18:33:10] <Capt_Blackwood> http://alexandersdesigns.net/awv7/ <<< I'm here if you want to help
[18:34:35] <lenswipee> anyone else care to recommend loader image?
[18:34:40] <lenswipee> or code
[18:34:40] <Andrew_R> you are calling .videoBG(), but the demo shows .videobackground()
[18:35:05] <Andrew_R> plus, I don't think you can put it directly on the body, you'll need to have a div at the top of the body
[18:35:25] <john-dev> lenswipee: it's calling .css('display','inline').. (not really)
[18:35:42] <Capt_Blackwood> I'm not using the one by george patterson
[18:35:45] <coldhead> he saiiid he alwaaays knewwww herrrr alonnnngg the shorrrrrelinnne
[18:36:08] <Andrew_R> oh I see, which plugin are you using?
[18:36:10] <Capt_Blackwood> http://syddev.com/jquery.videoBG/ <<< http://syddev.com/jquery.videoBG/
[18:36:13] <Capt_Blackwood> That one
[18:36:32] <tw2113> Capt_Blackwood, the only script file i see loaded is jQuery itself
[18:38:06] <Capt_Blackwood> what browser are you in?
[18:38:52] <Andrew_R> I agree with TW, the URL http://alexandersdesigns.net/awv7/js/jquery.videoBG.js doesn't resolve to a JS file.
[18:39:25] <Capt_Blackwood> how does that work out
[18:39:54] <Andrew_R> it redirects to www.alexandersdesigns.net/register/
[18:40:07] <coldhead> bummer
[18:40:52] <Capt_Blackwood> heh. bad file name. try now
[18:42:23] <tw2113> no console errors any more at least
[18:42:44] <Capt_Blackwood> true
[18:42:47] <Andrew_R> wrap your $('body').videoBG call in $(document).ready()
[18:44:30] <Capt_Blackwood> did i do it right?
[18:45:01] <Andrew_R> the correct format is $(document).ready(function() {  $(body).videoBG()..... });
[18:45:39] <coldhead> i'm getting very bored with this videoBG trial
[18:46:05] <Capt_Blackwood> trial?
[18:46:13] <coldhead> ordeal?
[18:46:21] <lenswipee> coldhead: recommend me a loader image please.
[18:46:25] <Capt_Blackwood> I'm hearing audio?
[18:46:38] <Capt_Blackwood> I've got audio...but no visual
[18:47:07] <coldhead> lenswipee: every single person on god's green earth uses the ajaxload.info link LocalPCGuy gave you already
[18:47:17] <coldhead> i have met people in their 90s who use that
[18:47:54] <lenswipee> coldhead: since you put in that way then i will use that one :)
[18:48:20] <tw2113> use one that works
[18:48:23] <tw2113> ;)
[18:48:27] <lenswipee> :D
[18:48:52] <lenswipee> And all HAIL coldhead as he is the ultimate jquery warrior
[18:48:58] <Andrew_R> lenswipee: you have lots of options on that site, choose the indicator type you want and pick your colors
[18:49:02] <Capt_Blackwood> so you're sayin pull the one from patterson?
[18:49:29] <lenswipee> Andrew_R: No worries. The site looked new and dodgy :)
[18:49:31] <Andrew_R> Capt_Blackwood: no he was talking about something else (load/spinner icons)
[18:49:37] <coldhead> poor patterson
[18:49:41] <Capt_Blackwood> mybad
[18:49:59] <Capt_Blackwood> so, we've got audio...how about the video?
[18:50:01] <Andrew_R> HTTP "Content-Type" of "text/plain" is not supported. Load of media resource http://alexandersdesigns.net/awv7/video/big-buck-bunny.webm failed.
[18:50:11] <Andrew_R> that's what I got
[18:50:32] <Andrew_R> I think your jquery issues are solved, now you have some Content-Type issues with your webserver
[18:51:20] <Capt_Blackwood> yeah, cos it works on IE
[18:51:31] <Capt_Blackwood> I'd say Issue with server and FF
[18:51:38] <Capt_Blackwood> Wouldn't you agree?
[18:51:59] <coldhead> absolutely
[18:52:01] <coldhead> ?cc
[18:52:01] <b-ot> coldhead: CASE CLOASED >:|
[18:52:02] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[18:52:07] <Andrew_R> your server is sending the wrong content-type header for .webm files
[18:52:31] <coldhead> damn that's good debugging Andrew_R
[18:52:35] <coldhead> this just got less boring
[18:52:35] <Capt_Blackwood> ah
[18:52:40] <Capt_Blackwood> just audio in chrome
[18:53:05] <Capt_Blackwood> i'm getting everything in ie
[18:53:10] <Capt_Blackwood> nothing in ff
[18:53:36] <Capt_Blackwood> or safari
[18:54:27] <Andrew_R> yup, you'll need to make sure your server is sending the correct content-type for .mp4, .ogv, and .webm files
[19:00:47] <Capt_Blackwood> the thing is, that's not my server
[19:00:51] <Capt_Blackwood> it's a webhosts
[19:02:28] <Capt_Blackwood> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> <<< What should that say then?
[19:07:50] <coldhead> that data is in your HTML file
[19:08:05] <coldhead> you can't add mimetype meta data to binaries in the same way
[19:08:23] <coldhead> you need the server to actually do the right thing and include the right type in the http header
[19:08:28] <Capt_Blackwood> chrome is working now
[19:08:50] <Capt_Blackwood> but what does chrome call up?
[19:09:29] <Capt_Blackwood> webm O.o
[19:12:38] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9Vzv/
[19:12:50] <initself> how do i get access to the original 'this' in the second subroutine?
[19:13:14] <initself> what is $(this) inside the success function?
[19:13:23] <coldhead> window, i think
[19:13:30] <coldhead> or possibly some XHR bollocks
[19:13:53] <initself> i'd like to it to be the button originally clicked
[19:14:11] <LocalPCGuy> add var orgThis = this; to the outer function, the success will have access to it
[19:14:21] <coldhead> initself: http://jsfiddle.net/Y9Vzv/1/
[19:14:21] * initself tries.
[19:14:38] <initself> jesus
[19:14:39] <coldhead> just save a reference when it refers to the thing you want and use that later
[19:14:42] <initself> can't wait to try it
[19:14:55] <initself> is var $this = $(this); something people do?
[19:15:01] <coldhead> it's very common, yes
[19:15:16] <coldhead> and on that bombshell, fuck all this i am going to lunch
[19:15:18] <LocalPCGuy> that is a way to cache the jquery lookup of $(this) so you don't have to look it up over and over
[19:16:53] <initself> coldhead++
[19:16:58] <initself> LocalPCGuy++
[19:17:13] <initself> Local to where tho

[19:19:58] <Capt_Blackwood> I must've borked something
[19:20:01] <lenswipee> LocalPCGuy: i didn't know id is an attribute. thanks
[19:20:23] <obert> lenswipee: do you know what p is?:P
[19:20:41] <lenswipee> p = paragraph
[19:20:51] <obert> heh i meant tag
[19:20:55] <Andrew_R> Capt_Blackwood: that works in FF, but I do get a message in the console: Specified "type" attribute of "video/mp4" is not supported. Load of media resource index.files/html5video/Metaliq_480p2997anamorphic16x9_copyrightdownloopscom.m4v failed.
[19:21:05] <lenswipee> how to grab id if i'm already at $(this)
[19:21:22] <Andrew_R> $(this).attr('id')
[19:21:31] <Capt_Blackwood> just tested in IE, FF, Chrome, Safari and the video plays
[19:21:43] <obert> lenswipee: easily by using my tool hehe http://csser.alwaysdata.net/
[19:22:40] <LocalPCGuy> lenswipee, this.id
[19:22:44] <LocalPCGuy> lenswipee, no jQuery needed
[19:23:00] <lenswipee> right
[19:23:19] <lenswipee> what is faster?
[19:23:36] <LocalPCGuy> this.id is marginally faster than $(this).id
[19:23:42] <LocalPCGuy> this.id is marginally faster than $(this).attr('id')
[19:23:57] <LocalPCGuy> first one was typo
[19:25:02] <lenswipee> ok
[19:25:50] <obert> ot: feedback about my pycsser design?
[19:26:27] <obert> decent==a, horrible==d
[19:27:55] <lenswipee> d
[19:28:06] <obert> :(
[19:28:16] <lenswipee> dd
[19:28:27] <obert> why
[19:29:08] <lenswipee> looks boring
[19:29:24] <lenswipee> add some more color, more wow factor
[19:29:34] <Andrew_R> disagree, simple != boring
[19:29:35] <obert> it is a tool
[19:30:21] <lenswipee> tool that does what? enter html and checks it >
[19:30:33] <obert> try it
[19:30:43] <obert> paste <p id="foo">
[19:30:56] <obert> or read the about page
[19:31:40] <CaptBlackwood> hey, got the video to load
[19:31:41] <obert> thanks Andrew_R btw :p
[19:33:23] <Andrew_R> Python is great, I wish I got a chance to use it more.
[19:33:42] <CaptBlackwood> i think the damn thing needs formatting
[19:33:43] <obert> heh i heard that all whole night
[19:35:12] <lenswipee> obert: "Paste HTML source to be inspected:" <--- make that white, not black!
[19:35:19] <obert> and i assume that lenswipee doesnt got usability skills ;)
[19:35:55] <obert> black??
[19:36:17] <lenswipee> obert: shows up black on IE9
[19:36:26] <obert> ie9???
[19:36:43] <Andrew_R> I think your HTMLParser object could be better though, Python has a built in HTMLParser so you don't have to do the string and regex finding.
[19:36:46] <lenswipee> obert: yes IE 9.0 by BIll GatEs
[19:37:12] <obert> this is ridiculous
[19:37:49] <obert> Andrew_R: i dont use regex there
[19:38:07] <Andrew_R> nope, I brought up my Windows VM to check, looks white to me.
[19:38:10] <obert> lenswipee: i doubt that someone who is writing css is using ie9
[19:38:26] <lenswipee> i am
[19:38:43] <lenswipee> Andrew_R: your VM has ie9?
[19:38:47] <obert> Andrew_R: no regex at all in the parser https://github.com/Obert/PYCSSer/blob/master/pycsser.py
[19:38:48] <Andrew_R> yep
[19:39:14] <lenswipee> definately black on my end
[19:39:22] <lenswipee> who cares anyway
[19:39:46] <CaptBlackwood> hey Andrew_R I got it working. webms aren't going but it's getting close to doing what I want
[19:39:54] <CaptBlackwood> now I just need the thing to resize
[19:40:13] <Andrew_R> obert: gotcha, I was looking at the wrong file, HTMLParser.py is a library I guess
[19:40:13] <obert> lenswipee: still black?
[19:40:31] <obert> Andrew_R: yep, it is the built-in thingy
[19:40:41] <lenswipee> obert: yes
[19:41:11] <obert> lenswipee: did you refreshed the page and checked if legend { color: #fafafa; } is added in my css?
[19:41:40] * Nonyaz takes a number
[19:41:43] <lenswipee> obert: no, and i'm busy sorry.
[19:42:03] <lenswipee> obert: well yes i did refresh, and it was black
[19:42:06] <obert> well, i added that rule. if it is still black i've no idea
[19:42:13] <lenswipee> obert: that is all i'm prepared to do
[19:42:44] <obert> no idea
[19:42:47] <lenswipee> just make it white
[19:42:52] <obert> ie9 bug
[19:42:56] <Andrew_R> looks fine on my IE9
[19:42:57] <obert> it is white.
[19:43:11] <obert> legend { color: #fafafa; } more than that i dunno
[19:43:41] <lenswipee> man i got my own problems to solve right now
[19:44:10] <obert> who is stopping you?;)
[19:44:24] <obert> and thanks for now btw
[19:46:06] <obert> Andrew_R: i wish i could had wrote that HTMLParser heh
[19:46:16] <initself> will this have a length if it doesn't match the selector at all?
[19:46:17] <initself> if ( $('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"] option[value="Y"]:selected').length === 0 ) {
[19:47:01] <LocalPCGuy> initself, no, and because 0 is falsey you can eliminate the === 0 in the if
[19:47:12] <initself> cool
[19:47:20] <initself> no wonder i got away with it all this time!
[19:47:24] <lenswipee> i confirmed that i cannot register a click event on <option> but i can for <select>
[19:47:58] <lenswipee> so how do i get the id of an <option> that user selected?
[19:48:25] <lenswipee> is this a bug also?
[19:48:34] <obert> $this.id.prop('checked')
[19:48:41] <obert> -$
[19:49:02] <obert> or something like that anyway
[19:49:04] <LocalPCGuy> lenswipee, maybe $('select').click(function() { $(this).find(':selected').attr('id')?
[19:49:10] <LocalPCGuy> });
[19:49:24] <ngharo> ?change @ lenswipee
[19:49:24] <bot-t> lenswipee, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[19:49:52] <LocalPCGuy> errr yah, change
[19:50:05] <lenswipee> should change be select an option or select level?
[19:50:11] <ngharo> select
[19:50:29] <lenswipee> i'll give it a try
[19:50:52] <lenswipee> still i reckon registering an event at <option> would be better not sure it doesn't allow it
[19:50:59] <ngharo> then inside the handler, this.value will be the value of the option selected; or this.currentIndex for the index of the option
[19:51:14] <ngharo> err this.selectedIndex
[19:51:28] <lenswipee> ok
[19:52:47] <initself> $('form[name="list_attempt"]').submit(function() { return false; });
[19:52:53] <initself> won't that prevent a form submit?
[19:54:24] <obert> gnite
[19:54:41] <Andrew_R> initself: yes that should prevent the form submit
[19:55:24] <initself> well then why t f isn't it!
[19:55:37] <PAGO> hello is here anybody who worked with SoundManager 2?
[19:57:30] <lenswipee> <option value"foo">, how to get "foo"? this.selectedIndex
[19:57:45] <Andrew_R> $('select').val()
[19:57:58] <ngharo> lenswipee: i told you man :) this.value
[19:58:22] <PAGO> hello is here anybody who worked with SoundManager 2?
[19:58:25] <lenswipee> ahh, you did too :)
[19:58:57] <coldhead> no there isn't, PAGO but if you can ask a more specific question we may be able to help you anyway
[19:59:38] <lenswipee> it this valid to have spaces
[19:59:46] <lenswipee> <option value "foo bar baz">
[19:59:58] <PAGO> mh no then its ok because i dont know why its not working :P
[20:00:15] <ngharo> lenswipee: yes, assuming you mean value="foo bar baz"
[20:00:24] <Andrew_R> if it's javascript and it's not working, check the console
[20:00:25] <lenswipee> yes
[20:00:25] <coldhead> PAGO: do the demos work for you on the SM2 site?
[20:01:23] <PAGO> no i am doing somethin wrong. i bet something basic because i am not that experienced with js
[20:01:51] <lenswipee> thanks guys
[20:01:55] <lenswipee> gotta run
[20:01:59] <lenswipee> bye
[20:02:48] <coldhead> lenswipee, i will never forget you
[20:03:03] <coldhead> PAGO: are you seeing any error messages in the console?
[20:04:20] <PAGO> no... so its something missing... i cant tell you something specific i will just keep on trieing. when i got a problem i can name i will tell you ^^. thx anyway
[20:04:33] <Nonyaz> Question: how would I get the access log tab to load from a tagged url like http://nonyaz.net/tabs#logg?
[20:06:04] <Andrew_R> Nonyaz: see http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-active
[20:07:25] <Nonyaz> Not quite sure how I would connect the dots on that, urltag > index > setter?
[20:07:34] <Andrew_R> and also see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11662693/how-do-i-get-the-value-after-hash-from-a-url-using-jquery#11662717
[20:09:15] <Andrew_R> so you get the hash from like the example on SO, then call $('#tabs').tabs('option', 'active', <tab number>) based on the hash
[20:09:25] <CaptBlackwood> YES! I got it http://alexandersdesigns.net/aw/
[20:10:08] <coldhead> way to be CaptBlackwood
[20:10:11] <coldhead> our hearts go out to you
[20:10:31] <CaptBlackwood> cross checking browsers
[20:11:01] <CaptBlackwood> ah, trip up on ie
[20:11:16] <coldhead> i don't think anyone really uses IE, don't worry about it
[20:11:21] <coldhead> all the IE users are on facebook
[20:11:26] <CaptBlackwood> safari doesn't support it
[20:11:27] <CaptBlackwood> look
[20:11:30] <coldhead> they don't know there is anything else on the internet
[20:11:31] <CaptBlackwood> poster trips up
[20:11:42] <coldhead> yeah let me just load safari on one of my many macs
[20:12:20] <macbleser> Hi All, anyone in here have any experience working with jQuery Isotope, more specifically using it with a fluid width container?
[20:12:28] <tw2113> good video choice CaptBlackwood
[20:12:39] <CaptBlackwood> just a test
[20:12:46] <CaptBlackwood> I'm looking for loops that i can use
[20:15:33] <LocalPCGuy> macbleser, I have
[20:18:23] <macbleser> LocalPCGuy so I'm probably being too nit-picky here but I really dislike the way the gutters between divs expand/contract while resizing your browser window
[20:19:49] <LocalPCGuy> if it is in a responsive size, the gutters have to be percentage based so that it doesn't break
[20:20:12] <LocalPCGuy> do you hvae an example?
[20:21:01] <macbleser> yeah so even on the default example here http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/fluid-responsive.html
[20:22:11] <macbleser> see how if you widen the window the gutters increase un proportionally to the columns until you stop resizing and it realigns the divs
[20:22:22] <LocalPCGuy> well, you don't have to use percentage based widths
[20:22:43] <LocalPCGuy> you can have fixed width elements and just let them realign as the browser resizes
[20:23:09] <CaptBlackwood> lol
[20:23:14] <CaptBlackwood> safari
[20:23:19] <CaptBlackwood> why do you FAIL!?! :P
[20:23:23] <CaptBlackwood> oh yeah...
[20:23:25] <macbleser> what I am looking for is fluid width elements with gutter fixed at 10px
[20:23:34] <LocalPCGuy> macbleser, I don't care for the fluid width elements at all, personally
[20:24:21] <pixelBash> you can have padding inside the element and no gutter...
[20:25:18] <LocalPCGuy> I would probably look at doing that (what pixelBash said)
[20:25:25] <macbleser> pixelBash that's exactly what I just tried but it still looks weird while you are resizing your browser
[20:25:27] <LocalPCGuy> probably the easiest way to accomplish your goal
[20:26:06] <pixelBash> what looks weird macbleser?
[20:26:07] <macbleser> I realize its an edge case considering us devs are the only people sitting here resizing out windows to test responsiveness
[20:26:47] <macbleser> let me see if i can grab an example
[20:27:30] <tw2113> firefox has built in tools to resize a window to test RWD breakpoints
[20:27:41] <LocalPCGuy> so does chrome ;P
[20:28:00] <pixelBash> yeah I've been having a similar issue with isotope, id like to center the column when it breaks down to one but for the life of me cant figure out how to do that
[20:28:03] <LocalPCGuy> not as easy to access
[20:28:06] <LocalPCGuy> though
[20:30:17] <pixelBash> LocalPCGuy do you think you could help quickly tidy up a responsive isotope? I think im just misunderstanding how the container works
[20:30:43] <tw2113> i'm continually impressed by the tools given to us to do our thing
[20:30:51] <tw2113> 5-10 years ago would be pink with envy
[20:31:02] <LocalPCGuy> if you have an example, I'll take a look.  can't promise I can fix it
[20:31:26] <pixelBash> no worries, essentially I just want to center the coumns in the container div on joeswann.co.nz/inspiration/
[20:32:25] <pixelBash> I'm considering just ditching isotope and making something more specific
[20:35:13] <LocalPCGuy> pixelBash, really looks like a CSS problem, not JS or isotope
[20:35:47] <LocalPCGuy> you need to adjust the width of the containing div as your page gets smaller.  You can either make it percentage based, so it adjusts automatically, or your can adjust the width of the pixel values in your breakpoints
[20:36:16] <pixelBash> oh so center the container as opposed to the things in the container
[20:36:31] <LocalPCGuy> for instance, when it goes to 2 columns, and in your breakpoint around liine 820, width 535px re-centers the container
[20:36:35] <LocalPCGuy> right
[20:37:58] <pixelBash> is it possible to make the image heights responsive without using reLayout on window resize?
[20:38:55] <macbleser> img width should be 100% with height auto
[20:39:26] <pixelBash> and isotope will watch the height?
[20:40:07] <tw2113> people worry about height in RWD?
[20:40:44] <macbleser> thats how i'm doing it but i have fluid width divs so it might be a little different than your example
[20:41:56] <herbnerder> no, that's worrying about aspect ratio, not a specific height
[20:42:03] <pixelBash> my example preloads each image before displaying it, makes it a little hard to assign an auto height
[20:42:24] <pixelBash> until the window has fully loaded
[20:42:56] <macbleser> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/help.html#imagesloaded_plugin
[20:43:17] <herbnerder> err, nvm. I thought you were talking about macbleser's "height auto" comment
[20:44:11] <pixelBash> macbleser well yes if I wanted to wait till all the images load before isotope appears
[20:44:34] <pixelBash> hmm could append each image as it loads. I'll try that
[20:45:10] <macbleser> yeah i hear you. the plugin is great but it definitely has some specific limitations
[20:46:14] <pixelBash> haha yeah its inherent in the way it uses position absolute to place the divs I guess
[20:51:36] <limpc> hi.. im writing a jquery extension, and am also using another jquery extension on a page, called MediaElement.  How do I trap events from MediaElement such as timeupdate, stopped, loaded, etc in my plugin?
[20:59:03] <limpc> nobody knows?
[21:04:27] <initself> limpc: you should show some code
[21:04:41] <limpc> for what?
[21:04:55] <limpc> im asking how you bind events between 2 plugins
[21:06:09] <Andrew_R> just like you would any other way, use .on()
[21:06:23] <limpc> no, that wouldnt work.
[21:07:51] <Andrew_R> why not?
[21:08:51] <limpc> the plugin uses a trigger to fire the event internally
[21:09:00] <limpc> methods = {  func.. func.. }
[21:09:48] <limpc> the plugin is MediaElement.js - cross platform media player. im trying to listen for its timeupdate event and update something in my plugin accordingly
[21:10:27] <limpc> I cant modify MediaElement.js - it needs to remain upgradeable
[21:11:46] <limpc> and I cant just listen for media timeupdate events.  The MediaElement.js uses either html5 (<video>), flash, or silverlight to display media, depending on browser support
[21:12:35] <Andrew_R> so depending on the type of playback it uses, it may or may not fire the 'timeupdate' event?
[21:13:07] <limpc> mediaelement has some maps that map each player type to the same timeupdate event
[21:13:20] <limpc> so from js, its transparent
[21:15:06] <Andrew_R> have you tried just doing $('#playerid').on('timeupdate', function(){ // do something });  ?
[21:15:11] <Andrew_R> it seems like that should work
[21:15:43] <limpc> would that work on flash and silverlight players?
[21:16:58] <Andrew_R> you said the mediaelement maps each player type to fire the same timeupdate event, so yeah it should
[21:17:34] <limpc> $('#playerid') binds to the video element though, not the mediaelement object
[21:18:48] <limpc> to bind to the mediaelement object I'd have to do var $player = new MediaElement('#playerid');  $('#playerid').myplugin({playerObj: $player});
[21:19:30] <limpc> however doing $player.on('timeupdate', function(timestamp) { }); yields no results
[21:20:11] <limpc> is there no way to directly listen to the plugin's internal firings?  perhaps a $player.extend or something?
[21:21:21] <Andrew_R> I haven't used this MediaElement plug in before so I'm not familiar with it, but binding events should work as long as you are binding the correct element
[21:22:04] <Andrew_R> Yes you can extend the MediaPlayer object, but I don't know what to tell you to add right now
[21:24:43] <Andrew_R> the demo has a success: function that binds to the mediaElement and sets a span tag, can you trigger another event on $(document) from there to make it easier to catch in your plugin?
[21:42:09] <shoky> .on('timeupdate'  works fine  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KBdq9/
[21:42:17] <shoky> limpc: ^^
[21:49:12] <limpc> shoky: i have something like this in the mediaelement's success:() function: $(media).mediapanel({media:media,node:node,player:player});
[21:49:29] <shoky> limpc: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KBdq9/1/
[21:49:43] <limpc> but when I bind to the event in my plugin via $(defaults.player).on('timeupdate', function(timestamp) {}); i get nothing
[21:50:00] <limpc> player is the mediaelement object
[21:50:10] <shoky> it doesnt need to be the object..
[21:50:14] <shoky> follow my example
[21:50:20] <shoky> it's the element
[21:50:47] <limpc> well the thing im concerned about is when it's not a html5 video element
[21:50:57] <limpc> mediaelement will use silverlight or flash if the browser does not support html5
[21:51:10] <shoky> thats what you're using it for
[21:51:13] <shoky> so you dont have to care
[21:51:21] <limpc> hrm so I can just listen on media?
[21:51:32] <shoky> why not?
[21:51:39] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KBdq9/3/
[21:51:44] <shoky> (to clarify..)
[21:52:32] <limpc> interesting. learn something new :)
[21:52:46] <shoky> next time listen to what people tell you at first ;]
[22:02:30] <limpc> http://jsfiddle.net/hkcU7/ i cant seem to use getters on it though
[22:02:43] <limpc> I also tried it on the player object. both return an error that its not a function
[22:03:32] <shoky> eh they put methods on the element too?
[22:04:51] <shoky> limpc: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hkcU7/1/
[22:05:32] <limpc> oh its not a method. durr.. okay
[22:13:47] <xboi209> jquery.org defaults to ssl but still loads content from http
[22:13:57] <xboi209> anyone wanna pass that on to whoever can fix this?
[22:15:36] <shoky> it's just jquery.migrate that's blocked..
[22:15:49] <shoky> i doubt anybody gives a feck
[22:16:47] <xboi209> no
[22:16:50] <xboi209> a lot more is blocked
[22:17:08] <xboi209> the whole page is just text without all the js libraries loaded
[22:17:47] <shoky> not here
[22:18:02] <vladikoff> xboi209, thanks!
[22:18:09] <xboi209> https://jquery.org/updates/
[22:18:30] <shoky> that page yep
[22:20:34] <vladikoff> xboi209, reported, will fix soon :)
[22:20:41] <xboi209> k
[22:54:52] <fresh> It would be neat if the docs had jsfiddle links
[22:55:16] <fresh> Like this one, for the first example it would be perfect. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[22:57:04] <Cork> fresh: what would jsfiddle links give that they don't get inline?
[22:57:19] <Cork> (btw .browser isn't supported anymore)
[22:58:07] <tw2113> the world ended once .browser was removed
[22:58:13] <tw2113> oh wait, it didn't
[22:58:38] <fresh> It only did for badly written software
[22:58:44] <fresh> so nbd
[22:59:59] <fresh> Cork: For that example in particular, it would be useful if I could click on a link, and then see the output. It doesn't need to be jsfiddle, if I could run the example inline, that'd be cool too.
[23:00:30] <Cork> fresh: they normally have demos in the page
[23:00:39] <Cork> combined with the source for it
[23:01:21] <Cork> fresh: http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/#entry-examples
[23:01:57] <fresh> Ah yes, that works
[23:02:50] <fresh> why not add these for all code snippets? You could automate in your doc generator
[23:04:40] <Cork> i don̈́'t think there is a doc generator
[23:04:49] <Cork> i think they're written by hand page for page

[23:28:01] <Hilton> Hallo. I'm dabbling in my first Ajax project. My working code is here -> http://pastebin.com/4iFgJa7H - Yes I'm sure it's ugly.
[23:28:06] <Hilton> My problem is with textareas.
[23:28:58] <Hilton> Inputs work fine - click a value, and it disappears and the input shows up; click out and it disappears. Make a change and click it and it disappears and calls .change() and updates perfectly.
[23:29:17] <Hilton> TEXTAREAS, however, are stubborn. They won't disappear unless you click out, click back in, then click out again.
[23:29:19] <Hilton> WHY
[23:32:34] <limpc> how do you get jquery to ignore divs/spans that are on top of another div?
[23:32:52] <limpc> sorry i mean for mouseover/mousedown
[23:33:59] <Hilton> Like, you have <div with mouseover>/r/php<div child blocks mouseover>foo</div></div> ?
[23:34:47] <limpc> nm i figured it out
[23:34:56] <limpc> have to make the elements children of the div
[23:38:50] <shoky> Hilton: seems fine to me: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gabM8/1/
[23:39:21] <shoky> Hilton: now with a delay http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gabM8/3/
[23:39:25] <Hilton> I just figured out my problem, actually. When the input is shown, it focuses. The textarea does not.
[23:39:35] <shoky> yep
[23:39:48] <Hilton> I'm clicking outside the textarea expecting it to disappear, when it hasn't gotten focus for .blur to work
[23:40:01] <shoky> aye
[23:40:21] <Hilton> because of find('input:first')
[23:41:12] <Hilton> NOW it works.
[23:42:12] <Hilton> Now I just need to figure out how to match this functionality with a multi-select that has an item toggle function (select multiple items without pressing ctrl).
[23:49:13] <Hilton> shoky: Any other comments on my amateur code?
