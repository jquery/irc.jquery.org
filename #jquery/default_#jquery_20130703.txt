[00:19:09] <tff> Anyone know of a clean way to check of an instance of $.Callbacks?
[00:19:19] <tff> Right now i'm just checking if obj.add is defined
[00:19:54] <tff> (I have a recursively defined Object, within which each element is either another Object or an instance of $.Callbacks)
[00:20:17] <tff> Couldn't figure out how to get the constructor name or whatever for $.Callbacks, for use in instanceof
[00:30:00] <Cork> tff: the function Callbacks is using is anonymous, so you can't check it
[00:30:55] <Cork> tff: i would prob look for fireWith or fire rather then add though
[00:40:39] <martisj_> when creating named functions to use as event handlers; what is the best way to define them? function myEventHandler() {};   or var myEventHandler = function () {};
[00:40:46] <martisj_> are there other ways of declaring them
[00:40:49] <martisj_> ?
[00:41:34] <ravenzz> either are fine if you know the difference
[00:41:54] <martisj_> ha
[00:41:59] <martisj_> ravenzz: i guess i don't really then
[00:42:09] <martisj_> what are they called?
[00:42:22] <martisj_> what is the correct terminology?
[00:43:11] <martisj_> so i can google for it.
[00:43:18] <martisj_> function expression and named funciton?
[00:43:56] <ravenzz> martisj_ http://www.dustindiaz.com/javascript-function-declaration-ambiguity/
[00:44:10] <martisj_> ravenzz: merci
[00:44:44] <ravenzz> martisj_ yeah http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/
[00:46:41] <martisj_> thanks again
[00:46:52] <ravenzz> you're welcome ;)
[00:48:54] <martisj_> are there any performance related issues with eithe?
[00:49:17] <Olive6767> Hi There :)
[00:50:33] <ravenzz> martisj_ I don't think so
[00:51:03] <martisj_> ravenzz: hmmm i guess i'll go with the declaration then
[00:51:08] <martisj_> so it's available off the bat
[00:52:05] <anton164> I'd like to try to highlight elements one by one with a 500ms interval, the following is the selector: $("#visualPaneTabs li:eq(0) a").effect("highlight", { color: "#66A4F2"});
[00:52:58] <Olive6767> I filling an array (myarray) with numeric ids like 123456, when I iterate on that array using for(var id in myarray), the order in whitch ids are comming is the one in witch I filled the array in firefox (wich is what I want), but the order is different numericaly sorted under chrome. How can I make sure to get my ids inthe same order I filled the array?
[00:53:00] <anton164> eq(0) would be where I could use an index and put it all in a for loop, but the problem is that it wouldn't have that 500ms interval, I'm guessing there's a good jQuery method for this?
[00:53:38] <ravenzz> martisj_ actually seems like that the function declaration is faster. Indeed if I would have bet to one of the two I'd have choose that one http://jsperf.com/function-declaration-vs-function-expression
[00:54:16] <martisj_> ravenzz: sweet thanks :)
[00:54:20] <martisj_> ravenzz: legend
[00:55:45] <noregret> anybody uses the jquery vaildation plugin ?
[00:56:13] <ravenzz> martisj_ but you may want to ask #javascript for further opinions
[00:57:02] <martisj_> ravenzz: yours is more than enough :)
[00:57:04] <martisj_> thanks
[01:01:01] <Olive6767> nobody?
[01:02:21] <tff> Olive, i'm no expert but perhaps you should index the items separately
[01:02:44] <tff> Oh, actually i read your question wrong
[01:03:03] <tff> this might be a subtlety in the implementation of for..in, but the behavior you described is surprising
[01:03:07] <Cork> Olive6767: you should never use for in on arrays
[01:03:25] <tff> Oh, and Cork thanks i will use fireWith
[01:03:55] <Cork> Olive6767: for in will loop whats in prototype too, not just the values in the array
[01:04:24] <Cork> Olive6767: a better option is to use for(var i=0; i < arr.length;i++) { arr[i] }
[01:04:58] <Olive6767> Cork: i had initially an object, I replaced it with an array to be able to try sort() to fix my problem but without success
[01:05:22] <ravenzz> eheh
[01:05:27] <ravenzz> objects are not sorted
[01:05:29] <Cork> Olive6767: so remove for in and you should be set
[01:05:31] <ravenzz> or sortable
[01:05:39] <Cork> well they are; if you create a new one
[01:05:56] <tff> Aren't they stored internally without regard to order?
[01:06:04] <ravenzz> yteah
[01:06:05] <ravenzz> -t
[01:06:25] <Cork> uh.. they are unordered ;)
[01:06:33] <Olive6767> Ihave same behavior with the object I initialy used: for in gave back my ids in the filling order under ff, but in ids order in chrome
[01:06:38] <Cork> sorted without regard to order isn't sorted :D
[01:06:38] <Olive6767> I need filling order
[01:06:47] <tff> Cork, stored!
[01:06:57] <ravenzz> Cork yeah they are unordered
[01:07:00] <Cork> tff: opps, missed that :)
[01:07:06] <tff> I was unsure about what you meant about the ability to 'create a new one' that is sorted, thats why i mentioned
[01:07:27] <Cork> tff: if you loop the existing object, and create a new one with the order you want
[01:07:32] <Cork> it gets "sorted"
[01:08:01] <tff> with the order you want, you mean an artificial ordering like { n:  A_n } ?
[01:08:09] <Cork> yes
[01:08:11] <ravenzz> yeah but sometimes that's something coming from the server
[01:08:25] <ravenzz> and you don't know how to sort it client side
[01:08:32] <Cork> ravenzz: well i said sorting, so i meant in js
[01:09:04] <Cork> Olive6767: anyway, what you need to do is to not use for in
[01:09:51] <Olive6767> Cork: ok, then how can I iterate on my array/object to get all the ids it contains in the filling order?
[01:10:13] <Cork> ole`01: look up a few lines, i wrote the code here
[01:10:21] <Cork> 6 mins ago
[01:10:49] <Cork> *Olive6767:
[01:13:55] <Olive6767> COrk: my array, object is filled this way: myarray[id] = {some object properties};
[01:14:16] <Cork> ok?
[01:14:51] <Cork> Olive6767: how are you adding the objects to the array?
[01:14:57] <Olive6767> for(var i=0,; i< arr.length; i++) won't target my ids
[01:15:06] <Cork> Olive6767: sure they will
[01:15:10] <Olive6767> ho
[01:15:11] <Cork> arr[i] == id
[01:15:36] <Olive6767> ho, yes there will be many unecessary iterration
[01:15:38] <Olive6767> no?
[01:15:47] <Cork> no
[01:16:05] <Cork> it will be one iterration for each array member
[01:16:24] <Olive6767> ok, got to try then
[01:16:29] <Cork> while for in will be one iteration for each property on the object or the array object
[01:16:42] <Cork> so if anything you will get less iterrations
[01:16:44] <Olive6767> there is something I don't get, trying now
[01:17:29] <Cork> Olive6767: that is if the array is something like [{key1:value, key2:value},{key1:value, key2:value},{key1:value, key2:value},{key1:value, key2:value}]
[01:17:57] <Cork> and id should be {key1:value, key2:value}
[01:28:29] <Olive6767> doesn't work: arr[i] != id
[01:28:31] <Olive6767> my array is in this format: [id1: {}, id2: {}, ... idn:{}]
[01:28:42] <Cork> uh
[01:28:46] <Olive6767> where id is 6 digit number
[01:28:47] <Cork> thats not a valid array
[01:29:07] <Olive6767> it's an array with holes
[01:29:09] <Cork> your creating an object from an array
[01:29:13] <Olive6767> none contigus
[01:29:19] <Cork> and array can't have holes
[01:29:24] <Olive6767> ok
[01:29:34] <Olive6767> that's why I initialy used an object
[01:29:45] <Cork> if you need to store it like that you need to use an object, ya
[01:30:02] <Olive6767> so my object is in this format: {id1: {}, id2: {}, ... idn:{}}
[01:30:05] <Cork> else store it like [{id:6dg-number},{id:6dg-number},{id:6dg-number},{id:6dg-number}]
[01:30:53] <Cork> Olive6767: but ya, you would have to store it in an object and then create a new object where the numbers is ordered if you want to do it that way
[01:31:22] <Olive6767> humm, so I have to synch 2 things....
[01:31:36] <Cork> either that or change the structure
[01:31:51] <Cork> you can sort an array based on a value inside an object
[01:32:50] <Cork> something like arr.sort(function(a,b) { return a.id < b.id ? -1 : a.id > b.id ? 1 : 0; })
[01:33:30] <srikat> Figured out how to apply the "equal height blocks in rows" jQuery code in WordPress.
[01:35:18] <Olive6767> Cork: ok, so an array with this format [{id: id1, ...}, {id: id2, ...}, ... {id: idn, ...} ] and a custom sort would do the trick
[01:35:27] <Cork> yes
[01:35:48] <Olive6767> ok, fair enough, thx a lot Cork :-)
[01:35:52] <Cork> np
[01:59:43] <Spacesoul> hi
[02:03:27] <ak5>  /j it
[02:03:32] <Spacesoul> Im searching a stable way of submitting an object form from jquery to a php server script. I have found some json scripts which converts the form to json format, but I have read some cases where the conversion fails. Is it there any known stable way of sending the form which works for most cases even with a complex form?
[02:04:14] <Spacesoul> I have also seen the posibility of serializing the form and send it as a string, but I would have to parse it later in my php
[02:05:00] <xec_> and you would not have to parse the json?
[02:23:24] <lmatteis> hi
[02:23:33] <Leo___> morning guys
[02:23:38] <lmatteis> how do i build a selector to get all the <a> tags in my html, but more specifically the HREF of these tags?
[02:24:24] <Cork> you mean you want all the link urls from all the link tags in the page?
[02:24:45] <lmatteis> can i use attr?
[02:24:54] <lmatteis> or prop
[02:25:15] <Cork> var links = $.map($('a[href]'), function() { return this.href });
[02:25:42] <Cork> ow wait map doens't use this
[02:25:42] <lmatteis> i mean:  $html.find('.publicationBox h4.title a').each(function(a){ ... // why isn't 'a' a jQuery object?
[02:25:52] <Cork> var links = $.map($('a[href]'), function(elm) { return elm.href; });
[02:26:08] <Cork> lmatteis: it is the dom element
[02:26:16] <lmatteis> Cork: wrong, it's the inded
[02:26:17] <lmatteis> *index
[02:26:21] <Cork> you need to wrapit your self if you need it
[02:26:22] <lmatteis> the second arg is the dom elem
[02:26:33] <lmatteis> but is there a native function that returns the jQuery obj instead of having to wrap it?
[02:26:45] <Cork> no
[02:26:53] <Leo___> need some help with form validation
[02:26:53] <Cork> lmatteis: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[02:27:09] <Cork> lmatteis: don't confuse $.map with $().map
[02:27:20] <lmatteis> anyway can i use .prop or attr?
[02:27:23] <lmatteis> for getting the href
[02:27:59] <Cork> sure if you want to change them just do $(this).attr('href', 'new url');
[02:28:07] <lmatteis> i wanna just get it
[02:28:09] <lmatteis> weird
[02:28:12] <Cork> Leo___: don't ask for help; ask the question
[02:28:19] <lmatteis> it automatically appends file:// if the href doesn't start with HTTP
[02:28:21] <lmatteis> why!??
[02:28:37] <Leo___> sure
[02:28:42] <Cork> lmatteis: i does it if you use prop and is from a local file
[02:28:59] <lmatteis> i just want the raw content
[02:29:02] <Cork> lmatteis: prop gets the property not the attr
[02:29:08] <lmatteis> ah thanks!
[02:29:12] <lmatteis> then attr is what i need ;)
[02:29:13] <Cork> attr gives you the plain attribute
[02:29:17] <lmatteis> yep
[02:29:35] <Leo___> http://pastie.org/8106146
[02:29:56] <Leo___> heres my code
[02:30:29] <Leo___> but i need it in functions so i can validate each field more like this http://pastie.org/8106089
[02:35:15] <ebol4> I'm using .ajax() to GET a large string full of HTML which I am then appending to a page
[02:35:27] <Spacesoul> I was out xec_ sorry, yes I would have to parse the json form later too
[02:35:44] <ebol4> The problem is, or at least, I think the problem is, the string of HTML also contains <script> and </script>'s
[02:36:40] <ebol4> And I'm not sure how to handle it. Currently when I try to append the string, I get the error "Cannot call method 'call' of undefined"
[02:36:49] <ebol4> And none of the Javascript on the page functions
[02:41:18] <airdem> hi guys
[02:41:39] <ebol4> Hello
[02:42:48] <airdem> i have a problem with jeditable. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/efa95832869975703f66/raw/fd51795c82ff3d775affd2a284b575b5303afbda/gistfile1.txt
[02:43:11] <airdem> the "id" option return undefined but the last console.log is working. any ideas why?
[02:43:18] <airdem> *returns
[02:45:07] <airdem> or how to find out why?
[02:46:17] <Cork> airdem: console.log($('.editable:first').length)
[02:47:24] <airdem> Cork: returns 1
[02:47:27] <noregret> is there an any plugin that can do such graphs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:6n-graf.svg ?
[02:47:57] <Cork> airdem: then the plugin you're using doesn't set an attribute id
[02:48:39] <airdem> Cork: the 3rd line is working and treturning the correct attribute id
[02:48:45] <airdem> but the 4th line doesnt
[02:49:11] <Cork> airdem: check the dom structure and make sure the first element with the .editable class has an id attribute
[02:49:33] <airdem> the last two lines are also working as expected
[02:50:09] <airdem> every element that has .editable has also an id
[02:50:57] <airdem> but .parent() and .closest() do not seem to work in the lines 3 and 4
[02:51:58] <Cork> airdem: you would have to check the dom structure; it is what matters for the last two lines
[02:52:18] <Cork> if the options for the first one you would have to check what the plugin does with them
[02:52:22] <Cork> uh...
[02:52:43] <Cork> you would have to check what the plugin does with the options
[02:52:54] <airdem> alright
[02:53:01] <Cork> as it might not have anything to do with the normal dom
[02:53:56] <airdem> console.log($(this)) returns a dom element
[02:54:12] <wagtag> Is there a way to detect browsers (like iOS) that don't support fixed body background images?
[02:54:12] <Cork> not sure why that would matter
[02:54:16] <airdem> but there are so many properties. i dont know what to look for
[02:54:54] <Cork> wagtag: try creating an element and set the property, then check if the property is set when you read it again
[02:56:59] <Cork> something like $.support.fixedbackground = (function() { var elm = document.createElement('div'); elm.style.backgroundAttachment = 'fixed'; return elm.style.backgroundAttachment == 'fixed'; })()
[02:57:26] <wagtag> Cork: Thanks! Good idea. I'll give that a shot
[03:03:11] <ph88> how can i make a json from a html form (with values)  ??
[03:05:27] <ph88> .serializeArray()  ??
[03:06:49] <wagtag> Dang. The backgroundAttachment property always comes back as 'fixed' in iOS even though the background does not stay fixed. Even tried checking the property directly from the body.
[03:31:51] <Leo___> hay guys were is my syntax going wrong in this code

[04:07:39] <boo> Hi! Is there a way to prevent clickthrough on an android device? http://pastebin.com/QBKn7hNs enables a dropdown list when you press on a link. An android tablet ignores that, and just activets tha  a href... iOs and pc works fine with that..
[04:14:22] <ldexterldesign> hey
[04:16:40] <CaptainHeavy> hey :)  I have an issue with "append" I believe.  Works fine in one web app but not in another, the code is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7d0208aa2498375c2a77
[04:17:01] <CaptainHeavy> essentially, the counter isn't being appended.  The correct element is being targeted.
[04:19:49] <ravenzz> CaptainHeavy line 38?
[04:20:25] <CaptainHeavy> ravenzz: the counter append line?
[04:21:07] <CaptainHeavy> ravenzz: the keyup works I believe, if I stick an alert in there it shows up
[04:21:27] <ravenzz> CaptainHeavy can you arrange a testcase on jsfiddle.net ? just static html and js  (no php)
[04:21:45] <CaptainHeavy> ravenzz: will give it a go!  Hang tight...
[04:22:49] <CaptainHeavy> AH
[04:22:57] <CaptainHeavy> got it, there's no counter div specified
[04:29:55] <CaptainHeavy> thank you for helping me point that out :)
[04:31:02] <ravenzz> np
[04:50:05] <theForce> hi
[04:53:20] <theForce> i set a data value like this: $('div.test').data('test', 1). is it now possible to search for all dom nodes that have data('test') set?
[05:05:47] <seutje> theForce: not afaik, u'll have to grab a set and .filter() them
[05:05:52] <boytoy_> At this Masonry "click-to-see-photos-only" thing - http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NEK4n/ - I'm using jQuery to restructure the HTML. But is there a way to achieve the same thing without restructuring the HTML?
[05:06:41] <seutje> theForce: if u wanna be able to use a selector, u'll have to .attr('data-test', '1')
[05:06:53] <seutje> then u can $('[data-test]')
[05:07:16] <seutje> thing is, jQuery keeps those data things internal, as to avoid DOM manipulation when it isn't necessary
[05:07:45] <sunbeam> is it possible to somehow draw the text within another <area>?
[05:07:48] <sunbeam> draw text within the specified coordinates
[05:07:50] <sunbeam> its important the text will always be inside the area shape
[05:08:52] <seutje> sunbeam: could you elaborate what you're talking about?
[05:09:29] <sunbeam> seutje: i have an <area> shape
[05:09:36] <sunbeam> shape="poly"
[05:09:46] <seutje> oh, this is svg?
[05:09:50] <sunbeam> no
[05:10:02] <sunbeam> coords="370,60, 372,65, 378,68, 383,65, 386,60, 383,54, 378,51, 372,54, 370,60"
[05:10:20] <burdpewpewp> Hi, im trying to use .each() on a array i created by exploding the windows url. i get .each is not a function any1 kno why this could happen?
[05:10:50] <seutje> sunbeam: ur trying to have text in a different element match the dimensions of the area?
[05:10:57] <seutje> or at least not protrude from it?
[05:11:04] <sunbeam> it should be inside that shape yes
[05:11:06] <sunbeam> the text
[05:12:36] <burdpewpewp> http://pastie.org/8106532#2, why does this error??
[05:13:21] <seutje> burdpewpewp: arrays don't have an each method
[05:13:40] <seutje> holy poop jsfiddle is slow today
[05:14:57] <burdpewpewp> <seutje> ok ty:P
[05:15:13] <moijk_> $.each(exploded...
[05:17:58] <Leo___> is this how a check if my val is empty
[05:18:00] <Leo___> if (email.test(emailvalue) == "")
[05:18:28] <Brutick> if ($("element").val() == "")
[05:18:29] <sunbeam> nobody knows if this is possible?
[05:18:36] <sunbeam> to contain simple text inside an <area> shape?
[05:19:04] <Brutick> sunbeam: I'm not familiar with the area tag
[05:19:51] <seutje> sunbeam: this might be helpful http://www.mathopenref.com/coordpolygonarea2.html
[05:19:56] <Leo___> Brutick: thats whats being passed
[05:20:11] <seutje> it's just basic maths rly, but there doesn't seem to be an API to make it easy
[05:20:56] <Brutick> Leo__: Then yes, what you have should work, I think
[05:21:22] <Brutick> Leo__: assuming that email.test(emailvalue) returns null
[05:22:07] <sunbeam> seutje: this is not what im looking for
[05:22:21] <seutje> it's polygon coords to x/y
[05:22:49] <seutje> no wait lol, my bad
[05:23:49] <Leo___> heres my expression var email = /[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}/;
[05:24:02] <Leo___> i want it to work for all lower case too
[05:26:05] <Brutick> Leo___: I'm not very good with RegEx, I don't want to steer you in the wrong direction. Someone else should be able to help you with your RegEx.
[05:28:40] <_Mounir_> hi guys
[05:28:44] <_Mounir_> i need your help plz
[05:29:05] <_Mounir_> i am new to the jquery world, i'm using ajax
[05:29:19] <_Mounir_> i have to extract some data from a json_decode
[05:29:32] <_Mounir_> what is the best way to get those data to use an auto completion ?
[05:44:55] <interop_madness> i need to ensure two things inside head: a favicon and <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'> for encoding purposes. since javascript may rely on the encoding specified in the meta tag for XHR requests, i suppose $(document).ready() is too late for meddling with the <head> section. is there any event suitable for my purposes?
[05:46:21] <Cork> interop_madness: the meta line doesn't have to be that long
[05:46:27] <Cork> <meta charset="utf-8"> should be enough
[05:47:09] <Cork> interop_madness: and yes meta is to late when ever javascript can run
[05:47:32] <Cork> interop_madness: btw why don't you just set those values in the server?
[05:47:36] <Cork> like htaccess?
[05:48:46] <interop_madness> this would be the lesser desired solution as the js code is a web control library which would ensure it cross-application-wide, regardless of server, once deployed
[05:48:58] <interop_madness> i.e. i could do it once and forget about it forever
[05:49:18] <interop_madness> the web applications in question will be deployed on several servers for several customers
[05:49:30] <Cork> interop_madness: eh.. implementing server code in js is doing it the wrong way
[05:50:06] <interop_madness> the problem is the application has to ensure UTF-8 or die starting
[05:51:11] <interop_madness> non-utf-8 configuration, even by mistake is unacceptable. i rather have the application not starting at all unless the proper entries in <head> are made. with JS i could(?) at least enforce it, without i would have to implement some hack in the global application class of ASP.NET
[05:51:34] <seutje> sunbeam: this sucks :( http://jsbin.com/iwureb/1/
[05:51:35] <Cork> interop_madness: you could try document.characterSet
[05:51:52] <Cork> not sure how cross browser it is though
[05:53:19] * Cork thinks servers should just default to utf8 if nothing else it set
[05:53:22] <interop_madness> Cork,  the problem is not how to change the encoding but when. in $(document).ready(), all resources have already been loaded and are probably being executed. XHR may already be on the way, possibly adhering to wrong charsets
[05:53:45] <Cork> interop_madness: you can't reliably change it
[05:53:50] <interop_madness> utf-8 is not always the default for german servers
[05:53:54] <Cork> the document has already been loaded
[05:53:59] <interop_madness> ok, damn
[05:54:03] <Cork> interop_madness: i know, most server doesn't
[05:54:09] <Cork> what i meant is they SHOULD
[05:54:47] <Cork> it's idiotic that most servers still default to ascii or similar
[05:55:00] <interop_madness> i agree. i consider the use every encoding other than UTF-8 a severe bug, notwithstanding the circumstances
[05:55:13] <Cork> ya, me too
[05:55:28] <Cork> same for sql server character table
[05:56:04] <interop_madness> we had so many encoding problems with web applications its unbelievable. i currently have a pre-build step running which flat out refuses to continue unless all files are file-encoded to utf-8 with BOM
[05:56:21] <interop_madness> i guess i will add <meta> parsing to that pre-build step
[05:56:50] <microcode> interop_madness: it may be worthwhile to look at the code chromium and firefox use to detect character encoding
[05:57:34] <Cork> microcode: that is byte sniffing, and it is complex and error prone
[05:57:39] <microcode> I'm going to be looking into it, as I've been receiving source code packages and documentation from japanese individuals and companies, encoded with a variety of incompatible encodings
[05:57:52] <microcode> (of course tweaking it for source code)
[05:58:12] <microcode> Cork: less error prone than just hoping for the best
[05:58:22] <Cork> microcode: not really
[05:58:34] <Cork> cause if you sniff you will get false positives
[05:58:37] <interop_madness> microcode, yes. from what i suspect, IIS also does some horristics (sic) based on the actual file encoding of aspx pages. at least we got rid of our encoding problems once we ensured <meta utf8>, file-utf8 and request/response utf-8, both server-side and for XHR
[05:58:44] <Cork> and those are sometimes ppl going it right
[05:59:03] <Cork> it's better to just demand the server end to actually fix there stuff
[05:59:04] <microcode> hopefully from a few hundred k of code, I can get a working encoding
[05:59:09] <microcode> and if it's wrong, I can do it manually
[05:59:47] <microcode> it's better than testing all the time whether it's EUC-JISX0213, SJIS-WIN SJIS-OPEN or any number of encodings
[06:00:16] <Cork> microcode: just check that the encoding is utf8 or throw an error
[06:00:59] <microcode> sometimes you have to accept something else, Cork
[06:01:13] <Cork> microcode: not really
[06:01:32] <microcode> I don't know what planet you're on, but on Earth, people write Japanese in Japanese encodings, Russian in Russian encodings, and latin alphabets are shoved into ASCII
[06:02:07] <interop_madness> microcode, what encoding are you talking about? i.e. what entities are encoded that way?
[06:02:12] <Cork> microcode: this are sites that still write for a standard that was used back in the 90's
[06:02:12] <microcode> and there's nothing you can do about that
[06:02:13] <aFeijo> good morning. Giving a group of 5 <li>, one of them has a 'active' class. I try to use .eq() to return its position number, but .eq() returned nothing. How can I do that?
[06:02:21] <interop_madness> i can have them enter kanji and still deliver it utf-8 from/to server
[06:02:50] <microcode> interop_madness: I'm talking more specifically about items which are not tagged with an encoding by any of the participating protocols
[06:02:58] <Cork> microcode: yes there are a few languages that isn't covered by unicode, latin and japanese isn't two of them though
[06:03:10] <microcode> I figured you may be having that issue, since normally encoding isn't an issue
[06:03:14] <interop_madness> microcode, concrete example?
[06:03:38] <microcode> interop_madness: like I said, people submitting source code files from Japan and Russia
[06:04:03] <microcode> where EUC, JIS, and KOIR encodings still reign supreme
[06:04:30] <microcode> s/KOIR/KOI8/
[06:04:34] <aFeijo> index() !
[06:04:43] <interop_madness> if these files are part of the web application, they can be transcoded to utf-8 upon build. if they are objects of transfer for the application, encoding should not matter
[06:05:12] <microcode> interop_madness: yup, I just figured you couldn't get the clients to agree what to send to the server
[06:05:30] <microcode> seems you were talking about an issue that you had already resolved with the standard methods
[06:05:47] <microcode> heuristic matching is the only option for untagged files
[06:05:56] <interop_madness> yes
[06:06:14] <microcode> and chromium/firefox do a decent job of it
[06:06:29] <ihaveaQuery> http://pastebin.com/hM2z6Bwp, http://pastebin.com/guq1cDnx .. I have these two codes, it seems like a simply problem but for some reason i can't get pass it .. Now what is happening is that when I select an option from the first drop down menu (id: sides) all the following drop downs change accordingly (fetch values from the database, all good there). But the issue arises when I am trying to update the price, now the algo is..
[06:06:30] <microcode> anyway
[06:06:30] <ihaveaQuery> supposed to go through each option selected in the form and extract the right price from the database but instead of taking the latest choices of dropdown options ( as can be seen on the display ) it takes the previous one which would give us the price of the last choice of dropdown options selected.
[06:07:00] <ihaveaQuery> all the jQuery in a test.html with getter.php called for some PHP functionality
[06:07:23] <microcode> ihaveaQuery: you're probably setting the options before the source map is updated
[06:07:40] <ihaveaQuery> Disclaimer: I am a newbie
[06:07:50] <microcode> check your javascript console then
[06:07:54] <wibby> parsing an xml schema doc, is there a reason that one has to declare the namespace in the selector for children, but must not for find? xsd.find('schema').children('xs\\:element')
[06:07:58] <wibby> ?
[06:08:03] <microcode> see if you're getting any silly errors
[06:09:41] <hemangpatel> jQuery.parseJSON not working in IE 9
[06:11:36] <hemangpatel> any choice ?
[06:13:23] <ihaveaQuery> microcode: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
[06:15:14] <seutje> hemangpatel: version?
[06:15:34] <hemangpatel> jquery ?
[06:16:22] <seutje> hemangpatel: yeah
[06:16:31] <Deviad> Hello
[06:16:33] <hemangpatel> it's new version
[06:17:40] <ph88> how do i create this header with jQuery.ajax() ?   "Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01"
[06:17:41] <hemangpatel> Problem is i get json with slash elements
[06:17:54] <xec_> hemangpatel: "new" is not a version number
[06:17:56] <xec_> ;)
[06:17:57] <Deviad> I am using wordpress and I am trying to implement a plugin I have on the static version of my website which is a mod version of lavaLamp called spasticNav. Unfortunately I am having this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'left' of null
[06:18:10] <Deviad> I read it is related to something called font-face and when it is rendered
[06:18:12] <Cork> ph88: dataType: 'script'
[06:18:14] <Deviad> can you please help me?
[06:18:33] <Deviad> This is the thread on stackoverflow that I opened: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17438955/wordpress-and-jquery-still-no-luck/17448605#17448605
[06:19:25] <xec_> Deviad: do you have a live url to a page where the issue happens?
[06:20:26] <xec_> Deviad: oh and, that answer you posted on SO isn't an answer, you should edit the original question and add the information there
[06:21:53] <ph88> thx Cork
[06:22:09] <hemangpatel> 1.7.1 version
[06:22:15] <Deviad> xec_ unfortunately not...
[06:22:24] <Deviad> is there a free host where I can upload my site?
[06:22:58] <xec_> Deviad: if you can pinpoint the issue (looks like you have) you can create a pared-down testcase at jsfiddle.net
[06:23:15] <hemangpatel> xec_ : 1.7.1 version
[06:24:23] <Deviad> xec_ it is a wordpress website
[06:24:55] <xec_> Deviad: but it is not a wordpress related bug, is it?
[06:25:19] <Deviad> xec_ the problem is that I don't have this in the static version
[06:25:51] <j3lte> Finally got some sleep, hi all, back here to solve the jquery mysteries ;)
[06:26:01] <Deviad> but I used also this: http://headjs.com/
[06:27:00] <Brutick> Welcome back j3lte :P
[06:27:27] <MindSpark> hi, I couldn't find a better place to ask this. I am using jquerymobile and am having trouble scaling the page to test it on a desktop browser.
[06:28:09] <arschmitz> MindSpark: scaling it? jquery mobile automaticly fits whatever screen its on
[06:28:10] <MindSpark> the background images are kind of large, 2000+px, and I am using this line <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=0.5, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1">. Can someone tell me what the best way is to test?
[06:28:59] <arschmitz> MindSpark: why do you have the scale set to .5?
[06:29:31] <MindSpark> arschmitz: because the images are bigger than my screen, so I was trying to scale things down in order to see the entire screen. But that is not working
[06:30:01] <j3lte> shouldnt you scale the images down using things like max-width:100%
[06:30:04] <arschmitz> you should always set inital-scale to 1
[06:30:17] <MindSpark> I mean there has to be a way to kind of trick the browser into thinking it is smaller than it actually is, no?
[06:30:40] <MindSpark> ok, I set it back...
[06:30:51] <arschmitz> MindSpark: you should not need to if you just set your scale to 1 and as j3lte use 100% for images it will jsut fit whatever screen its on
[06:30:53] <j3lte> I'm used to Foundation, I think it's better than jQuery Mobile (hope I'm not cursing right now in this channel ;) )
[06:31:14] <arschmitz> j3lte: what do you like better about foundation?
[06:31:24] <Coin-coin> Hi guys
[06:31:46] <j3lte> well to me it's more intuitive, but than again, I haven't used jQuery mobile that much
[06:31:47] <arschmitz> ( Disclaimer im one of the JQM devs ) but id like to know what you like better about foundation we are trying to improve
[06:31:55] <MindSpark> arschmitz: yes, but I think that jqmobile sets the body/html to overflow hidden and therefore I can not scroll down
[06:31:59] <Coin-coin> Do you know if webkit recognizes this kind of css selector : &:first-child + span + .div
[06:32:07] <Coin-coin> It works on FF opera IE but not Chrome
[06:32:29] <j3lte> arschmitz: good one, I will dig into that next week, I'll get back to you on that!
[06:32:29] <arschmitz> MindSpark: you cant scroll down because you have height=device-height
[06:32:53] <arschmitz> j3lte: cool we would really like to know what you like and dont like
[06:33:20] <j3lte> I'm here to help :), I come to love this IRC channel. Will do :)
[06:33:33] <seutje> Coin-coin: you have an element with a class of "div" ?
[06:33:37] <MindSpark> arschmitz: ok, I just removed the device-height part and still no difference :S
[06:33:43] <seutje> like <div class="div">...</div> ?
[06:33:45] <Coin-coin> remove the dot :p
[06:33:54] <Coin-coin> It's about the logic of this kind of selector
[06:34:00] <j3lte> MindSpark, do you have an example on jsFiddle?
[06:34:01] <arschmitz> MindSpark: jqm prevents horizontal scroll for the most part but not vertical
[06:34:09] <seutje> Coin-coin: "&" isn't recognized
[06:34:13] <MindSpark> j3lte: yes, one moment
[06:34:26] <Coin-coin> It's SCSS syntax, I forgot to say that
[06:34:59] <seutje> are you asking if webkit understands scss syntax?
[06:35:07] <Coin-coin> Nah
[06:35:32] <Coin-coin> I'm wonderinf if webkit supports :first-child + span + div syntax
[06:35:39] <seutje> sure
[06:36:39] <seutje> Coin-coin: http://jsbin.com/aretod/1/ works in my webkits
[06:36:54] <Coin-coin> Hmm
[06:37:06] <MindSpark> j3lte: http://jsfiddle.net/6PKz7/
[06:37:08] <seutje> Coin-coin: it's probably because webkit does more broken-markup-fixing than the average browser
[06:37:22] <MindSpark> there's not much to test really
[06:37:36] <MindSpark> it's just a very primitive attempt to test out jqmobile
[06:38:17] <nVee> hey guys, is there a way I can use just the name='somename' as a selector without indicating say textarea[name='somename']?
[06:38:29] <arschmitz> MindSpark: it does not scroll because you have no content
[06:38:36] <Cork> nVee: remove the textarea part if you want
[06:38:41] <Cork> it will be slower though
[06:39:17] <seutje> MindSpark: jsfiddle already adds head and body elements, the html field is for what goes inside the body
[06:39:38] <j3lte> MindSpark: I agree with arschmitz, this is not a real working example
[06:39:47] <nVee> ahhhh
[06:39:53] <nVee> I must learn to test before I ask
[06:39:55] <nVee> sorry about that
[06:41:16] <MindSpark> j3lte, arschmitz , ok, maybe I've misunderstood this, but shouldn't the viewport meta tag automatically increase the body to the size to the device height?
[06:42:07] <j3lte> MindSpark: not to my knowledge, but arschmitz is clearly the expert on this topic
[06:42:28] <arschmitz> MindSpark: your issue is that your pages have no content
[06:42:34] <MindSpark> then what exactly does the viewport meta tag do?
[06:42:46] <arschmitz> the viewport tag is all about scale
[06:42:48] <MindSpark> arschmitz: what if I want a page with nothing in it but a background image?
[06:43:03] <arschmitz> you need to set the size of your page with css then
[06:43:17] <arschmitz> you have no content in your pages
[06:43:28] <arschmitz> and css will not expand an element to show a background image
[06:43:45] <arschmitz> your elements are all collapsed because they have no content
[06:44:26] <nVee> Cork: If I want to fine tune the selection by providing the form ID along with the name part? I tried: var field_value = $(selected_form+" [name='"+field_name+"']").val();
[06:44:35] <arschmitz> if you just want a bunch of pages that are just images dont use background
[06:44:50] <Cork> nVee: .find()
[06:44:58] <arschmitz> just put the imgage as an img tag in the page with width:100%;
[06:45:13] <arschmitz> just like j3lte suggested
[06:45:32] <MindSpark> arschmitz: alright, I'll try to add some content and will let you know if I face issues
[06:46:03] <arschmitz> MindSpark: may i suggest you start with this http://jsbin.com/uzaret/1/edit
[06:47:14] <MindSpark> arschmitz: oh, thanks!
[06:49:33] <jerojasro> hi all. is there any way of defining explicitly the execution order of the event handlers for an event?
[06:50:20] <Cork> jerojasro: the execution order is in the reverse order they where added
[06:50:34] <Cork> and only way to change that order would be to remove the listeners
[06:51:15] <jerojasro> Cork: hum. eww. thanks.
[06:51:58] <Cork> jerojasro: that is as long as the event listeners are on the same element though
[06:52:11] <jerojasro> document.ready ...
[06:52:13] <Cork> apart from that you have the bubble order
[06:52:19] <Cork> ah
[06:52:27] <Cork> that isn't really a pure event though
[06:52:31] <Cork> but ya it is in queue order
[06:54:26] <jerojasro> Cork: I have a couple of event handlers, and I've seen them execute in any order
[06:54:51] <Cork> jerojasro: .ready isn't an event handler
[06:55:11] <Cork> it is a queue function backed by two events; but it isn't only triggered by events
[06:55:24] <Cork> jerojasro: and it will be in queue order
[06:55:40] <Cork> if you get mixed order you run it in async loaded scripts
[06:55:48] <Siecje> I am trying to add drag and drop functionality https://dpaste.de/KB0AQ/ when I try to add update code it stops working
[06:56:02] <Siecje> in fact if I just have items it doesn't work
[06:56:46] <motaka2> can anyone give me an idea why sometimes $.script works sometimes not ?
[06:57:02] <Cork> motaka2: not generically no
[06:57:26] <motaka2> Cork: Does that happen to you too ?
[06:57:31] <Cork> motaka2: it tries to use ajax when possible so that might have to do with it (and i suspect you mean .getScript())
[06:57:36] <jerojasro> Cork: yep; the "event handlers" are loaded in different js files
[06:57:38] <Cork> motaka2: no not really
[06:57:54] <Cork> jerojasro: that doesn't really matter
[06:58:03] <Cork> jerojasro: where you load the files in the html does though
[06:58:22] <Cork> or rather resources
[06:58:29] <motaka2> jerojasro: Is that related to my question ?
[06:58:35] <Cork> motaka2: no
[06:58:37] <j3lte> Siecje: where do you try to add update? This code is a bit of a mess imho
[06:58:53] <j3lte> Oh wait, never mind. Let's see
[06:58:54] <motaka2> Cork: From where do u suggest me to debug ?
[06:59:12] <Cork> motaka2: check what kind of request it makes, and go from there
[06:59:28] <Cork> check if it is cross domain or not and so on
[07:01:34] <motaka2> Cork: It just happens on page which loads a heavy js for a persian calendar. sometimes it says Calendar.Setup is not a function but - it just sometimes says that. Even if I reboot my laptop. it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt.
[07:01:54] <Siecje> j3lte: .sortable({}); makes it drag and drop but .sortable({items: "tr.module"}); does not work
[07:01:56] <Cork> motaka2: so your code is racy
[07:02:06] <Cork> motaka2: are you using the callback function?
[07:02:13] <motaka2> Cork: What does racy means?
[07:02:37] <Cork> motaka2: that you arn't waiting for the resource to be loaded, so if the connection or server is slow
[07:02:45] <Cork> you will execute before the script is loaded
[07:03:20] <j3lte> Siecje, can you provide a better example on jsfiddle, with items? Let's figure this out
[07:03:26] <motaka2> I am using deffereds
[07:04:25] <Cork> from the getScript call?
[07:05:18] <motaka2> Cork: lemme show you the code
[07:07:27] <motaka2> Cork: http://codepaste.net/m132bt   - please check a function called - render
[07:10:34] <Cork> motaka2: uh... oook you base your code around async ajax calls
[07:10:48] <motaka2> shouldnt I ?
[07:10:51] <Cork> motaka2: and that is known to cause bugs as the browser has to fake move events to make it work
[07:10:51] <Siecje> j3lte: http://jsfiddle.net/rD4hY/
[07:11:05] <Cork> motaka2: async ajax is left for legacy support
[07:11:20] <Cork> motaka2: it gets no new features, and it has know bugs (that is very hard to fix)
[07:11:30] <Cork> *has known
[07:11:41] <motaka2> Cork: So what should I do ?
[07:11:43] <Cork> so ya, you should NEVER user async: false
[07:11:54] <Cork> motaka2: base your code around callbacks or deferred instead
[07:11:54] <slax0r> can css mess up jquery. width()/innerWidth()?
[07:12:02] <Cork> and not return values from ajax calls
[07:12:34] <motaka2> Cork: I dont understand you.
[07:12:51] <Cork> motaka2: and not to forget that sync ajax calls can lock up the browser for minutes if your unlucky (the entire browser that is)
[07:13:20] <Cork> motaka2: Confs should return the jqxhr object from $.ajax
[07:13:47] <Cork> motaka2: and every caller that wants the data from it should use .done(function(data) {}); handler
[07:15:45] <motaka2> can u please change some parts of the code- so I can better get waht you say? Should I change aync:false in Confs to async:true ?
[07:16:24] <Cork> you should yes, but that means you have to rewrite the entire structure of the page
[07:18:56] <Brutick> Cork/j3lte: Do you remember the problem I was having yesterday? I'm referring to this code that I've rewritten to not be as terrible as it was: http://jsfiddle.net/ANNdt/1/ -- If you don't remember the problem, the issue I am apparently still having in IE9 is that when a user clicks Page2 and redirects to that page, the jQuery dialog no longer works. But on refresh of Page2, the jQuery dialog magically works again.
[07:19:13] <motaka2> Cork: And then whenever i need confs.get('imgAjax'), I should first do confs.done.get('imgAjax')   ?
[07:19:25] <Cork> motaka2: no
[07:19:36] <motaka2> Cork: ?
[07:20:32] <Cork> motaka2: you would have to do variable.done(function(data) { /* do something with data['imgAjax']; */ })
[07:20:47] <Cork> where something does NOT include setting a variable for access outside the callback function
[07:20:57] <Cork> motaka2: that is what async means
[07:21:03] <Cork> you don't know when the data comes
[07:21:28] <Cork> motaka2: alternatively you can have events not bound until the ajax call is triggered, and then "start" the page
[07:22:02] <j3lte> Siecje this problem is a pain in the a** ;-). Diving into it
[07:22:03] <motaka2> Cork: I dont have any idea what you are saying. What should I read to learn ?
[07:22:13] <Cork> motaka2: async javascript
[07:22:19] <JimmyXander> does anyone know a way, or can you point me to a way to detect when the mouse leaves an object via the top?
[07:22:44] <motaka2> Cork: Do you know of a good tut which looks at it from the point of jquery ?
[07:22:53] <sammich> mousemove -> track points
[07:22:53] <Cork> not really no
[07:23:04] <sammich> mouseout -> record points at the event
[07:23:08] <Cork> man why do so many think it's a good idea to have element#id...
[07:23:28] <Cork> Brutick: don't have element names infront of your id selectors; it only makes them slower
[07:23:46] <lamarus> I have a div with padding of 60px … When i do a slideUp() on it … it seems it is adjusting the top style down from 60px while it does the slide up.. is there a way to prevent this?
[07:23:48] <Brutick> Cork: Okay, haha. That's an easy change
[07:23:53] <amph1bius> I've used it in the past because I used a general id name and didn't want to collide
[07:23:55] <jedimind> Cork wait what?
[07:24:02] <jedimind> how does defining the element type prior to the ID make it slower?
[07:24:04] <Cork> Brutick: but it most likely won't fix your problem
[07:24:10] <Cork> yes
[07:24:20] <Brutick> Cork: I can upload a full example of what I'm experiencing. I managed to replicate it on a small 2-page local site
[07:24:28] <Cork> jedimind: element#id means look up all elements of type element; then filter it by the page uniq id
[07:24:37] <Cork> instead of grab the element matching the #id from the id hash
[07:24:55] <jedimind> doesnt that do the same thing only it goes through every single element
[07:25:01] <jedimind> and not just the one youre specifying
[07:25:44] <Cork> jedimind: it does the difference between var ids = []; ids[id]; and a compleate walk though the dom
[07:25:55] <amph1bius> what if the id hash is bigger than the number of elements of that type ?
[07:25:58] <jedimind> Cork shit sorry
[07:26:04] <Cork> jedimind: the browser already has a hash table fo all the id's in the page
[07:26:09] <jedimind> i just realized you're talking about the way sizzle processes it
[07:26:14] <jedimind> i thought i was in #css
[07:26:15] <jedimind> my bad
[07:26:19] <Cork> amph1bius: it is still faster as the browser already has it in memory
[07:26:26] <Siecje> j3lte: var result_active = $('#sortable tbody').sortable('serialize'); doesn't contain anything ,
[07:26:30] <Cork> jedimind: it is the same for css
[07:27:04] <j3lte> Siecje... somehow this code locks up for me
[07:27:05] <sammich> except css is run on native code
[07:27:16] <Cork> jedimind: sizzle just does document.querySelectorAll('element#id') compared to document.getElementById('id') (though document.querySelector('#id') is about as fast)
[07:27:26] <Cork> sammich: so does sizzle most of the time
[07:27:41] <sammich> this is true
[07:27:52] <Cork> sammich: it only runs in js when you combine arrays or make the : special queries
[07:27:58] <Siecje> j3lte: what do you mean locks up? stops dragging and dropping?
[07:28:01] <Cork> like :eq()
[07:28:03] <jedimind> Cork i dont suppose you have any links handy to support this? sorry it just sort of goes against what i always thought was more efficient in respect to perf
[07:28:41] <sammich> jquery run a 'feature select' before running :not?
[07:28:49] <Cork> jedimind: the look up speed for css is id, class, element, attribute
[07:28:54] <Cork> jedimind: and no i don't have a link handy
[07:29:11] <sammich> jedimind: look up jsperf tests on selectors
[07:29:15] <jedimind> i know but given that its a compound selector, i imagine it wont look for id as a first pass, then the element as a second pass
[07:29:24] <jedimind> but rather look for elements with that id vs any element with that id
[07:29:39] <jedimind> anyway im not saying im right
[07:29:47] <jedimind> its just how i understood it
[07:29:52] <jedimind> im often wrong though
[07:29:52] <Cork> jedimind: combound looks from left to right; separate selectors look from right to left
[07:30:06] <Cork> element #id is fine
[07:30:10] <Cork> element#id isn't
[07:30:17] <j3lte> Siecje, this might be a problem with jQuery, you are using the last version right? I tried this in jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rD4hY/2/
[07:30:26] <roy_raider> hi guys, how can i load a function after a defined time and after the document.ready ?
[07:30:29] <j3lte> And that seems to alert the correct sorted array
[07:30:51] <sammich> roy_raider: window.setTimeout(function, time)
[07:31:26] * sammich pounces on the LHF
[07:31:27] <roy_raider> ty sammich i will try
[07:31:29] <jedimind> http://jsperf.com/jquery-performance-bn/3
[07:31:30] <Cork> roy_raider: that sounds like you are doing something network related and tries to solve it with a timer
[07:31:31] <jedimind> yeah i guess that proves it
[07:31:57] <Siecje> j3lte: I included the jquery in the html at the top of the html panel maybe try a different version there?
[07:32:09] <sammich> I can see how that could be the case
[07:32:23] <jedimind> though in opera it looks like its about the same, in fact maybe even better perf by type
[07:32:26] <jedimind> but who cares about opera
[07:32:28] <Cork> roy_raider: if you are, you shouldn't
[07:32:39] <j3lte> Siecje: for jsFiddle you include jQuery on the left (Frameworks & Extensions)
[07:32:49] <Cork> jedimind: you mean the browser that has gotten eol?
[07:32:49] <roy_raider> no i'm not, i'm using a jquery script
[07:32:52] <Cork> :)
[07:32:53] <jedimind> haha
[07:32:59] <roy_raider> when i use it after document ready, shit happen
[07:33:01] <jedimind> TYL!
[07:33:03] <jedimind> err TIL
[07:33:04] <roy_raider> when i do it in my console
[07:33:07] <amph1bius> haha
[07:33:07] <roy_raider> or later
[07:33:08] <roy_raider> it's ok
[07:33:09] <roy_raider> =(
[07:33:11] <Cork> jedimind: opera-next is just a chromium theme
[07:33:15] <jedimind> yeah
[07:33:30] <sammich> whoa, that by Class selector just demolishes jQ
[07:33:57] <amph1bius> are you guys switching to FF now that its the fastest browser, lol.
[07:34:00] <jedimind> more on the topic https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Writing_efficient_CSS
[07:34:03] <Cork> roy_raider: that sounds like your in different scopes and that is what breaks it for you
[07:34:27] <jedimind> thx Cork
[07:35:03] <Siecje> j3lte: but how do you include more than one I am also using jqueryui
[07:35:49] <Cork> sammich: oh, right i did this one a bit back; found it interesting http://jsperf.com/idlookup
[07:36:15] <sammich> divtastic
[07:36:15] <j3lte> Siecje: "External Resources", put the url of the jquery ui script there
[07:37:26] <Cork> especially the difference between $('#1-foo, #2-foo') and $('#1-foo').add('#2-foo')
[07:37:50] * sammich dies
[07:38:06] <sammich> or the two sep getByIds
[07:38:14] <Cork> heh
[07:38:31] <Cork> $([document.getElementById('1-foo'), document.getElementById('2-foo')]) :D
[07:38:31] <ph88> when i put some more elements in a div the div could get bigger ... how do i calculate the new div size before i put the actual elements in ?
[07:38:55] <Cork> ph88: why do you need to?
[07:39:04] <Cork> just put them in and then grab the new height
[07:39:10] <ph88> because i want to enlarge the box first with a nice effect and then fade in the elements
[07:39:34] <Cork> so add them with visibility: hidden
[07:39:37] <sammich> well, you could built it in a mirror div
[07:39:37] <j3lte> ph88 than you should now the sizes of the elements beforehand
[07:39:39] <ph88> ok easy
[07:39:41] <Cork> and then animate the height to auto
[07:39:42] <ph88> thx again Cork
[07:39:49] <Cork> then fade them in
[07:39:59] <j3lte> Cork is it tht easy? damn
[07:40:10] <Cork> j3lte: ya
[07:40:17] <ph88> i think i can make it :)
[07:40:17] <motaka2> Cork: Give me a tut please
[07:40:48] <Cork> ph88: don't forget to set the height of the element to a static value BEFORE you add the element though
[07:41:23] <Cork> motaka2: i don't have a collection of tutorials sorry
[07:41:47] <motaka2> Cork: Would u please search for me ?
[07:41:49] <Cork> i rarely look for tutorials my self, i prefer reading code
[07:41:57] <Cork> for the async js?
[07:42:17] <ph88> Cork:  already got that covered :)
[07:42:30] <Cork> motaka2: try googling how asynchronous javascript works
[07:42:37] <j3lte> motaka2.... they invented something like search engines ;)
[07:42:56] <motaka2> Cork: google doesnt work here, and bing seems not get good results
[07:43:23] <j3lte> lolwut... Google doesnt work?
[07:43:24] <horacsio> Hi. testing. 1… 2...
[07:43:25] <horacsio> ok
[07:43:45] <jedimind> motaka2 where is "here" that google doesnt work ?
[07:43:54] <j3lte> China!
[07:44:13] <jedimind> it works there too, just different results :)
[07:44:25] <Cork> well "googling" normally just means search for it in a search engine in your browser
[07:44:27] <horacsio> I need to toggle a div hide and show, but instead of going up or down, I need it retract it self to its height center point.
[07:44:39] <Cork> at least here it means that
[07:44:54] <motaka2> everything in firefox seems to be bigger
[07:45:27] <jedimind> thats what she said
[07:45:39] <Cork> O_o
[07:45:42] <j3lte> ROFLOL
[07:46:00] <shoky> wat
[07:46:19] <tdignan> Hi. When I redirect back to the current page again to display an error message, my javascript does not run. I have looked in to pageshow, pageinit, and pageload events, and none of them fire: they only seem to fire if I land on a different page than I started. Is there any way to solve this, or did I miss something?
[07:47:28] <Cork> tdignan: are you using a framework that makes navigating ajax based?
[07:47:46] <tdignan> Cork: I'm using jquerymobile. I didn't realize I just got redirected to the main channel when I joined there.
[07:48:14] <Cork> tdignan: check popState, it MIGHT work for you
[07:48:14] <wolfehr> hey all, I'm trying to remove an event handler with off(), however it appears I can't pass an object to it, I have to pass an actual selector. Any ways around this so I can unbind just a specific object rather than everything?
[07:48:27] <tdignan> Cork: cool thanks. I'll give it a try.
[07:48:39] <Cork> wolfehr: use a namespace
[07:48:40] <arschmitz> tdignan: pageshow fires every time a page is shown
[07:48:56] <Cork> wolfehr: .off('event.my-special-name-space')
[07:49:03] <arschmitz> tdignan: pageinit and pageload only fire the first time
[07:49:06] <Cork> wolfehr: .on('click.my-special-name-space', function() {})
[07:49:45] <wolfehr> Cork, I've got $(document).on('.my_handler'), and I'm unbinding like $(document).off($myObject);
[07:49:55] <shoky> motaka2: this might help you some, tho it goes deeper than what you seem to want.  http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[07:50:14] <motaka2> shoky: Thank you
[07:50:23] <wolfehr> all of the elements have the same class, so unbinding based on the selector is a no go. I don't understand what you're saying regarding a namespace?
[07:50:28] <Cork> wolfehr: no you most likely have $(document).on('event', '.my_namdler', ...)
[07:50:40] <Cork> wolfehr: the .name-space goes in the event type string
[07:50:41] <tdignan> Cork: so, popstate is not jquerymobile specific. it's standard js, right?
[07:50:47] <Cork> tdignan: yes
[07:51:00] <Cork> it gets triggered if you have used pushState
[07:51:09] <Cork> if you haven't it's pointless
[07:51:18] <arschmitz> tdignan: be careful using popstate its not supported in all browsers
[07:52:20] <seutje> aw man, I gotta wake up, totally read prostate
[07:52:27] <Cork> wolfehr: a full example could be: $(document).on('click.dialog', '.ui-dialog a', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }).off('.dialog')
[07:52:43] <Cork> seutje: procrastinate? ;)
[07:52:56] <seutje> any time, any where
[07:53:28] <wolfehr> I don't think I've got my point across right, This is what I'm doing:  $(document).on('click','.form_submit_button',function(){} . I then have an instance when a .form_submit_button is clicked, whereby I need to do $(document).off('click',$instance_of_form_submit_button)	
[07:53:45] <tdignan> nope, popstate does not work.
[07:53:50] <tdignan> not for this, anyway.
[07:53:51] <wolfehr> I can only apparently supply a selector to the second argument, I can't supply an object
[07:54:04] <tdignan> I am surprised this is not simpler..
[07:54:06] <Cork> wolfehr: yes, so add a namespace when you bind the event
[07:54:19] <Cork> wolfehr: you got your point a cross
[07:54:41] <shoky> he wants to disable the click event only for one of the .form_submit_button elements, it seems
[07:54:54] <wolfehr> but I'm binding to all .form_submit_button's, I only want the one being clicked to be unbound
[07:55:04] <Cork> yes, but to do that he needs to bind it with a namespace
[07:55:07] <momomomomo> wolfehr: Long story short, you need a way to uniquely identify that element. Either by knowing its position on the page, or something.
[07:55:18] <shoky> but he's binding to document anyway
[07:55:29] <Cork> at least that is the most reliable way to do it
[07:56:43] <Cork> wolfehr: there is one alternative to what i took your question for; and if that is the question
[07:56:55] <wolfehr> if I have an id attached to that element, I'm still a bit stuffed aren't I? As the off() would only unbind based on the class, not the id?
[07:56:56] <Cork> the answer is: there is only one event listener when you delegate them
[07:57:11] <Cork> so you can't remove it from one event that it bubbles from
[07:57:25] <wolfehr> I guess I could $.each() through all elements with that class, then on() based on their id
[07:57:30] <shoky> wolfehr:  one way is..  $(document).on('click', '.form_submit_button.clickable', fn)       $instance_of_form_submit_button.removeClass('clickable')   or something like that
[07:59:28] <wolfehr> shoky, if you've clicked it, then I remove the class (in a new click handler) won't the origianl event still be triggered?
[07:59:58] <amph1bius> can you just disable the button using the disabled attribute
[07:59:59] <shoky> wolfehr:  if you remove the class, it will no longer match the selector, so no it won't trigger the handler
[08:00:30] <shoky> wolfehr: because it's a delegated event handler on the document element
[08:01:08] <Brutick> Cork/j3lte: Figured out the cause of the problem. Apparently <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> on IE9 causes jQuery to go wonky. Setting "IE=8" fixes the problem... but I have no clue why we cannot use "IE=edge".
[08:01:36] <Cork> Brutick: edge works just fine here
[08:01:48] <amph1bius> i bevelie IE=edge makes it use the most updated version of IE on your computer
[08:01:50] <amph1bius> so it depends
[08:02:00] <amph1bius> believe
[08:03:04] <Brutick> Cork: I have an isolated example of my issue using IE 9.0.8112.16421 (I don't really have any options to upgrade, due to work policies)
[08:03:21] <Brutick> Cork: I could upload a .zip to dropbox or something with the files to show you the issue.
[08:03:35] <Cork> Brutick: try making the example work in jsfiddle
[08:04:09] <Brutick> Cork: How can I demonstrate page changes in jsfiddle?
[08:05:05] <Cork> Brutick: you can have two fiddles and have them change the fiddle.jshell.net backend url
[08:05:20] <shoky> you can upload it unzipped to dropbox. at least that worked for me once
[08:05:20] <shoky> (and give a public link)
[08:08:55] <tdignan> Cork: is there another way I should be handling the form? If I want to return a 400 error code from my web service, is there a way to catch that before the ajax form completes? So far, I've had to write no code to get the ajax form with jquery mobile, so I'm  having trouble figuring out how to hook the error handling mechanism, if one exists.
[08:17:17] <Sirisian|Work> In jquery I'm animating an easting for a faded css mask. .css("-webkit-mask-image", "linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) 5%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) 95%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0))"); Basically I'm going to go from 0 to 1 on the alpha. Can I use the step option in the animate function for this? It looks like animate requires a numeric property
[08:20:19] <Sirisian|Work> hmm maybe I should be using css3 animations.
[08:21:03] <tdignan> \o/, my problems are solved
[08:21:13] <tdignan> i was hooking pageshow incorrectly.
[08:21:31] <Brutick> shoky: http://db.tt/3gO46mW4 - Download the pages, and throw them in the same folder.
[08:25:13] <Saaether> Brutick works in IE9 for me
[08:25:56] <Brutick> Saaether: Try to switch from page1 to page2 and then click the dialog link
[08:26:04] <Saaether> yup works fine
[08:26:28] <Brutick> Saaether: this is very frustrating :(
[08:29:53] <Brutick> Oh well, screw it. I'm making X-UA-Compatible IE=8 for now
[08:30:10] <Brutick> This isn't a public site anyways
[08:35:49] <horacsio> I need to toggle a div hide and show, but instead of going up or down, I need it retract it self to its height center point.
[08:36:14] <Maffelu> If I want to use removeclass and have a dot in the class name is there a function already for that? Like "removeClassWithDot" or so in jQuery?
[08:37:11] <shoky> Brutick: you're missing a doctype
[08:37:25] <Whirl3d> Anybody got a good modular date preference plugin? I keep having to allow my client to setup the date in his how format and it just seems like should be reusable code.
[08:37:53] <Sirisian|Work> horacsio, you can use .animate and define a step function. I'd imagine the div would need to be position absolute maybe and use top and bottom from 0 to 50%? Don't quote me, but it might work.
[08:38:22] <Sirisian|Work> actually that wouldn't work since the height would be fixed. hmm hard problem.
[08:38:57] <Whirl3d> sometimes he was 06/05/13 sometimes 05-04-2013 sometimes June 5, 2013 sometimes Thursday, July 4, 2013  I keep having to write these little patches
[08:40:23] <horacsio> Sirisian|Work: ever saw any example of the code?
[08:40:28] <shoky> Brutick: but yeah it works here too
[08:41:01] <Sirisian|Work> what code? To do what you want? I've never seen anyone write it.
[08:41:15] <amph1bius> why not use a date picker ?
[08:41:55] <Whirl3d> It's not the input that is a problem. It's the output. THanks for the reply amph1bius
[08:42:03] <lhunath> I'm doing e.fadeOut().removeClass('foo'); - how can I perform the removeClass only after the fadeOut animation completes?
[08:42:30] <fuchstronaut> fadeOut('slow',function(){ removeClass()
[08:42:58] <fuchstronaut> check the documentation, theres a callback function for every animation that is fired after the animation is doen
[08:43:00] <fuchstronaut> *done
[08:44:00] <lhunath> hmm; alright.  is there no way to do it inline, that would be prettier and nicer to chain multiple animations.  e.fadeOut().removeClass().addClass().fadeIn()
[08:44:49] <Whirl3d> You could use a deferred object?
[08:45:43] <Whirl3d> or use css animations
[08:46:10] <theCole> does jquery have a method that returns the current version?
[08:46:32] <shoky> theCole: $.fn.jquery
[08:47:31] <theCole> awesome shoky tyvm
[08:50:16] <koskoz> what's the counterpart of $('.foo > .bar') with $('.foo').find()?
[08:51:51] <shoky> .find('> .bar')  or .children('.bar')
[08:52:25] <koskoz> shoky: does children will select only the first level of child or all nested levels?
[08:52:46] <shoky> only first
[08:53:24] <koskoz> thanks shoky :)
[08:54:31] <Bothering> -.-
[08:57:54] <Siecje> j3lte: I don't think I can do drag and drop on update with ajax how can I run that code when you click a button
[09:10:28] <boytoy_> At this Packery "click-to-see-photos-only" thing: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/ -- I'm using jQuery to put all photos in its own div before initiating Packery.
[09:10:31] <boytoy_> But is there a better way of doing it? Ie. using CSS to hide everything except the photos, and still getting Packery to initiate without restructuring the HTML?
[09:12:49] <sadmicrowave> hey all, wondering what is up with this functionality, could someone help? http://jsfiddle.net/cVGY4/
[09:13:16] <sadmicrowave> all-in-all divs #_1 and #_2 should be excluded from turning red
[09:26:47] <Sirisian|Work> horacsio, If you haven't found a solution yet that's elegant you might be able to use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip with percentages somehow.
[09:28:59] <horacsio> well i found something but… I don't know if I can manage :D
[09:31:13] <horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/theguywholikeslinux/87f4Y/
[09:31:56] <jedimind> why not use css3 transitions for that horacsio ?
[09:32:09] <horacsio> css transitions?! :S
[09:32:12] <horacsio> not aware :S
[09:36:34] <sadmicrowave> jedimind +1 for css transitions
[09:37:13] <Bothering> css transition is prety cool
[09:37:38] <Bothering> jus beware there r sum hanus ways to do it
[09:37:49] <Bothering> and gud ways
[09:39:39] <horacsio> Bothering: but I need to make the div to be reduced both sides at same time! :S
[09:40:00] <Bothering> width?
[09:40:39] <horacsio> height. and with a click
[09:40:49] <horacsio> http://www.w3schools.com/css3/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_transition1
[09:41:35] <horacsio> well it didn't sent my code :S
[09:41:57] <horacsio> but i need the bottom go up and the top go down
[09:42:20] <horacsio> and all inside content disappears with the main div
[09:43:09] <jedimind> ugh w3schools
[09:43:28] <WebDragon> there has to be a better site for playing with css3 transitions than that
[09:43:50] <vsync_> w3schools imba
[09:44:01] <Bothering> quit biching
[09:44:04] <Bothering> jeeesh
[09:44:09] <vsync_> y
[09:44:16] <Bothering> like a bunch of bag ladies
[09:44:56] <Bothering> DEAL W IT
[09:45:33] <horacsio> ok transitions won't work because it won't hide the main div content.
[09:45:34] <Bothering> http://gifstumblr.com/images/deal-with-it_1505.gif
[09:45:43] <Bothering> horacsio: chek my link
[09:45:53] <horacsio> as animate. toogle hide and show the content.
[09:47:16] <Bothering> maybe transition the content to transparent
[09:49:10] <sadmicrowave> you could still do css transitions, just make a wrapper div around the one you are actually trying to animate and perform the transition effect on the wrapper div padding property.  This will give the effect that the inner div has it's height reduced on both top and bottom (and left and right sides if you want too)
[09:49:52] <sadmicrowave> so, on click your transition effect would fire and change the padding of the wrapper div from x to y
[09:56:41] <Siecje> I am trying to get this just a list of numbers https://dpaste.de/o3sv2/
[09:57:52] <Bothering> friken sadmicrowave

[10:46:42] <garbagegod> Question, I'm making a slider and I'm wondering about the best way to actually move the slides. Right now I'm using margin-left on the first slide (this is a slider containing 3 slides at a time for example). My question is, what's the smoothest way to move the slides? Right now I'm using .animate({ 'margin-left': 'Xpx' }, 10); and it works okay, but I feel like there's a better way I don
[10:46:48] <garbagegod> 't know about
[10:47:02] <sadmicrowave> Siecje you should probably be more specific about what you are trying to do if you want help...
[10:47:25] <Spork2013> How can I make this slide-out contact div hide the form and submit button and slide back in when a user clicks "Submit?" http://jsfiddle.net/49VpX/1/
[10:48:07] <jonkri> will jquery's .ready handler be executed before <script> elements in the body?
[10:49:38] <BillCriswell> sadmicrowave: This is a bit confusing to me. What's your goal, to just exclude elements form a collection?
[10:53:48] <andrewSC> I'm trying to figure out the deferred and promise functions and I'm getting a little lost
[10:54:57] <andrewSC> basically I want to have two ajax calls run async then if one returns before the other, the one that is finished waits for the second ajax to complete. Once both are complete a final function is called using data from both of the calls
[10:55:46] <horacsio> i need this div's, called MAIN, bottom go up and the top go down and hide the div content - anyone?
[10:55:48] <s5fs> andrewSC: promises won't address your concern, go back to just counting how many times the same function is called (as I suggested in ##javascript)
[10:56:08] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Why not just wait for them both to complete.?
[10:56:11] <andrewSC> s5fs: oh so $.when won't really address the issue?
[10:56:44] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: $.when.apply(null, arrayOfRequests).done( doThings );
[10:56:52] <s5fs> andrewSC: in my opinion, no. you can accomplish this more easily by just having both ajax calls execute the same callback and increment a counter. when the counter hits two (or whatever), call your final processing function and reset the counter back to zero.
[10:57:45] <BillCriswell> sadmicrowave: http://jsfiddle.net/cVGY4/1/ will this work for you?
[10:59:28] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: http://jsfiddle.net/wXP3B/
[11:00:31] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/wXP3B/1/ Weee
[11:01:22] <BillCriswell> Actually, here is some variety so you can see all the requests happening: http://jsfiddle.net/wXP3B/2/
[11:01:37] <andrewSC> s5fs: where is the data stored from the first ajax request until the other ajax request is completed? The counter has to be outside the scope of the final callback but where does the data get put? does it also get assigned to some var outside the ajax request?
[11:01:54] <andrewSC> I'm getting a little confused by the scope of things here
[11:02:32] <sadmicrowave> BillCriswell: thats great, I'll need to reverse the logic to exclude #_1 and #_2 from being colored, I'd like the others colored and the items within the exclude array actually excluded from the operation
[11:03:15] <BillCriswell> sadmicrowave: return !pass; instead of return pass
[11:03:51] <sadmicrowave> BillCriswell: yep, thats what I changed it to! thanks for the help dude
[11:03:52] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Did you see the example I gave you?
[11:04:01] <BillCriswell> No problem sadmicrowave.
[11:04:09] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: Yup, I'm also looking at :http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/
[11:04:25] <andrewSC> and he's using pips and deferreds and promises and I'm losing it haha
[11:04:38] <andrewSC> I assume I don't need all this..
[11:05:14] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: It's from 2011. jQuery has evolved a lot since then.
[11:05:28] <horacsio> can anyone help me at least to find out some solutions? I need to click and resize div height from top and bottom and from bottom to top. please take a look to this gif simulating what I need to do:http://img818.imageshack.us/img818/1755/l0o.gif

[11:06:40] <Th0masR0ss> It's not working.
[11:06:40] <Th0masR0ss> er
[11:06:44] <Th0masR0ss> &nbsp;*
[11:07:10] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: It's still a good read, but I'd definitely look up some newer information afterwards.
[11:07:28] <FrEaKmAn_> hi.. do you suggest any plugin for translations/i18n?
[11:07:39] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: so I could technically do something like $.ajax({stuffhere:yesetc}).done(function(data, status, etc){return data;})); and have another one with the done function call returning a second value then have the $.while with a callback that takes two arguments?
[11:08:09] <andrewSC> errr

[11:09:52] <BillCriswell> That should clear it up I think.
[11:10:22] <andrewSC> oh interesting
[11:10:28] <andrewSC> I'll give this a go, thanks BillCriswell
[11:10:32] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[11:11:45] <sadmicrowave> BillCriswell: couldn't I use $.inArray() rather than iterating with $.each()?
[11:12:25] <BillCriswell> sadmicrowave: If you're only testing ids sure, but if the array can be any selector I'm not sure how much it would help.
[11:12:52] <BillCriswell> $.inArray( this.id, idArray ) for example
[11:12:57] <BillCriswell> Not sure how to work tht in with .is

[11:13:17] <sadmicrowave> good point

[11:13:43] <Coin-coin> I keep searching but I find no clue
[11:14:33] <Coin-coin> A margin or outerwidth or whatever
[11:17:15] <horacsio> Coin-coin could you help?
[11:17:56] <Coin-coin> I guess you could do that using two divs
[11:18:00] <Coin-coin> an upper div and an lower div
[11:18:45] <Coin-coin> I don't know much about jquery :p

[11:23:32] <dfrey> I'm new to js and jquery and thus have a dumb question.  If I have something like this: var hostSelected = $('select[name=host]').find('option:selected'); What type of object is hostSelected?  It seems like it must be some sort of iterable collection of results.  How can I test whether it's empty?
[11:24:03] <blindMoe> pretty good starter sentence
[11:24:26] <blindMoe> dfrey: .length would help you out
[11:24:47] <blindMoe> also get in the habit of sending objects like that to console.log() or console.dir() so you can just see what it is returning
[11:24:53] <BillCriswell> It's a jQuery collection.. which is kind of an array.
[11:25:52] <dfrey> ahh ok, that makes sense.  I'm an experienced programmer, I just haven't done much web stuff
[11:25:56] <glosoli> Hey is there some way to prevent other element event from happening  ?
[11:27:27] <thujone> .stopPropagation() might be what you're looking for
[11:28:20] <glosoli> thujone: though I am not quite sure for the path of accessing stopPropagation on the element hmm is there some easy way to find ? It's button element
[11:36:02] <markgm> I've got a problem with jqm, is this the right place to ask
[11:36:35] <Brutick> markgm: You're in the right channel, yes.
[11:37:59] <markgm> I'm trying to dynamically set the selected option for a dropdown, i've tried many things with no luck, either the jquery mobile markup renders correctly and the option is selected in the html but not the dropdown button...
[11:38:23] <BillCriswell> dfrey: I am the opposite... I think.
[11:38:25] <markgm> ...or the correct option is displayed and the jqm markup isnt rendered
[11:38:31] <markgm> any reason for this?
[11:38:51] <SporkSpork> How can I put a black border around this slide-out div element? http://jsfiddle.net/49VpX/4/
[11:39:06] <markgm> i don't really have any readable code to show because of the complexity unfortunately
[11:39:22] <BillCriswell> markgm: Are you doing $('select').val('optionValue') or $('select').val('optionText')?
[11:39:55] <markgm> BillCriswell, yes i have tried both
[11:41:29] <BillCriswell> markgm: Would be hard to know without looking at the code sadly. Is there a function populating the select?
[11:41:55] <BillCriswell> Not 100% familiar with jQuery mobile.
[11:42:15] <markgm> BillCriswell: yes i'm using templates with underscore and backbone
[11:42:59] <BillCriswell> You just have to make sure you select the option after it's populated.
[11:43:33] <Brutick> SporkSpork: This is closer to working. http://jsfiddle.net/49VpX/5/ (sort of)
[11:43:59] <markgm> BillCriswell: yes it appears that the right element is selected because when I open the dropdown the correct element is highlighted, however, the button text does not reflect this
[11:45:45] <SporkSpork> Brutick: Thanks. That looks cool in its own right!
[11:46:20] <Brutick> SporkSpork: I like that the border transitions with the rest of it, so it looks kind of cool to me.
[11:46:30] <NaOH> how can i get access to a widget in jquery mobile? for example i want to call updatePagePadding() on a fixed toolbar widget

[11:54:26] <JamShady> Hi guys, I've got a really basic question... but for the life of me I can't find the answer anywhere. I've created a new theme using ThemeRoller, downloaded the files and referenced them on my page. Now obviously it's not going to work by magic, but are there some jQuery helpers that'll apply the relevant classes, etc, to existing items on the page
[11:54:26] <JamShady> , or do I have to add the classes to everything manually? Or am I missing something obvious?
[11:54:57] <SporkSpork> Brutick: Ah, okay. Thanks for the help with the border, though!

[12:27:35] <Saaether> brilliant
[12:32:59] <NaOH> is there a jquery mobile event that fires when everything is completely done loading and adjusting? the docs say pageinit, but apparently i need something later than that
[12:33:22] <arschmitz> NaOH: no pageinit is a replacment for document ready
[12:33:33] <arschmitz> it is not when everything is done rendering
[12:33:40] <arschmitz> NaOH: that is pageshow
[12:33:48] <SporkSpork> How can I get this slide-out to thank the user for submitting? At this point, there's no visual indication that the form was processed? http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/2/
[12:34:04] <Cyclohexane> i have a .bind() event and then a new Class( with an ajax call inside how do I use $(this) meaning the thing bind() triggered on inside the newClass ajax call?
[12:34:07] <NaOH> arschmitz: would i bind that to $(document)?
[12:34:07] <Saaether> NaOH: try pageload
[12:34:34] <NaOH> arschmitz: or $(":jqmData(role='page')")?
[12:34:56] <arschmitz> Saaether: pageload is when the when the page has finished loading via ajax
[12:35:49] <arschmitz> NaOH: $.mobile.document.on("pageshow", ":jqmData(role='page')", function(){ ....
[12:36:35] <arschmitz> NaOH: that is fired every time the page is actually shown there are a couple small things that happen after that like hiding urlbar and such if you want after EVERYTHING use pagechange
[12:37:07] <arschmitz> but its mostly just scrolling that happens between pageshow and pagechange
[12:38:34] <NaOH> arschmitz: you seem like an expert, so maybe i should present my real problem rather than asking about my hack fix. i have a fixed header toolbar, but the padding is not being correctly calculated on the page so the content goes behind it. my hack idea was to wait until everything rendered and then trigger updatelayout on the header, which would work. but is there someway i can figure out the real problem?
[12:38:48] <arschmitz> NaOH: im one of the jquery mobile devs
[12:39:06] <NaOH> arschmitz: i suppose that would make you an expert hahaha
[12:39:28] <arschmitz> NaOH: that sounds like a css problem
[12:39:46] <arschmitz> the fixed toolbars adjust the page padding to account for the header and footer
[12:40:08] <NaOH> arschmitz: do you think there is some padding set somewhere that is overriding it?
[12:40:53] <arschmitz> NaOH: probably not since its set on the element directly so unless you use !important somewhere
[12:41:12] <arschmitz> NaOH: however there are many things that could effect it besides just that
[12:41:33] <arschmitz> if you can make a simple jsbin testpage demonstrating the issue ill be happy to look
[12:41:56] <NaOH> might the actual page be simple enough? http://cdhp-app.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
[12:42:00] <NaOH> or do you need it simpler?
[12:42:09] <arschmitz> oh and make sure you dont have data-fullscreen="true"
[12:42:35] <arschmitz> NaOH: ill look real quick and see if i see the issue right off
[12:42:49] <NaOH> arschmitz: oh yeah, and it only shows up when you refresh, not when you navigate directly to the page
[12:44:23] <Saaether> NaOH hmm interesting, when you click skip login and then go back your padding issue is gone
[12:44:43] <NaOH> Saaether: yeah, even if you just resize the window it fixes
[12:46:15] <arschmitz> thats because of the function updatePagePadding which fires everytime a page is shown or the window is resized
[12:47:12] <SporkSpork> How can I get this slide-out contact form to thank the user for submitting? At this point, there's no visual indication. http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/2/
[12:47:30] <NaOH> arschmitz: do you recommend i simply fire that event on pageshow?
[12:47:33] <Bothering> ye ye
[12:47:41] <Saaether> NaOH i actually dont even have the issue when i view the site on my phone
[12:47:48] <Saaether> its only on my desktop
[12:47:51] <Bothering> ye ol matey went to the pub
[12:47:59] <Bothering> went to the pub
[12:48:00] <NaOH> Saaether: i'm getting it on my iphone emulator
[12:48:01] <Bothering> went to the pub
[12:48:06] <arschmitz> NaOH: it already is something weird is going on with your inital pageload
[12:48:47] <NaOH> arschmitz: is it weird that it happens when you refresh the page, but if you go back to the address bar and hit enter it is fine?
[12:49:15] <NaOH> arschmitz: that really baffles me
[12:49:26] <arschmitz> NaOH: im not super familier with ember but at what point is the view rendered in terms of JQM events?
[12:51:17] <NaOH> arschmitz: i'm not sure :/
[12:51:53] <arschmitz> what it seems like is that the header has no height when updatePagePadding is fired initally
[12:52:22] <arschmitz> because its running and setting 2 px
[12:52:46] <ner0x> https://gist.github.com/5922079 So when you use this actionConfirm modal the first time and select cancel then use it a second time and hit submit it fires but function references. Is this something in JS or jQuery I'm unaware of? It seems like a very odd problem. Any help would be appreciated.
[12:52:49] <arschmitz> which is just the top and bottom border
[12:54:23] <arschmitz> NaOH: i think the reason for the difference between enter and refresh is its a race condition between ember and JQM
[12:54:51] <ebol4> I'm using .ajax() to GET a page of HTML from elsewhere, which I then append to the current page. When the HTML is appended, it all appears to append correctly, but I get a "TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined" error in the Javascript console. The error mentions    at jQuery.fn.extend.domManip (...), 6298:16) so I think it might have something to do with some Javascript that's mixed in with the HTML I'm appending.
[12:55:08] <arschmitz> on enter only 286B are downloaded on refresh its 10.9KB
[12:56:04] <NaOH> arschmitz: very interesting!
[12:56:15] <NaOH> arschmitz: that's brilliant
[12:57:37] <arschmitz> so without knowing more about ember the quick fix is to trigger updatePagePadding on pagechange go as late as possible to hopefully avoid the race condition
[12:58:47] <arschmitz> NaOH: just my 2 sense of client side MVC on mobile though is i think your placing a lot of processing load on the client on potentially slow devices
[12:59:38] <NaOH> arschmitz: i regret it very much
[12:59:59] <sacrebleu> on http://www.cliquevodka.com/index/ I am trying to implement http://workshop.rs/2011/09/news-ticker-in-4-lines-of-jquery/ and if you in firebug place a breakpoint on line 12 of the script, this never happens for some odd reason, version 1.8.0 .. line 12 runs, but the thing it is doing does not work, thoughts?
[13:01:09] <sacrebleu> line is in function ticking_twitter()
[13:08:20] <andrewSC> I wrote 300LOC today, am I lightweight?
[13:08:29] <andrewSC> LIGHT WEIGHT BABY
[13:08:37] <Bothering> umm
[13:08:46] <Bothering> my code is only 5 lines
[13:09:25] <Bothering> var code = moerCode.extend({ 5 lines });
[13:16:45] <boytoy_> At this Packery "click-to-see-photos-only" thing: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/ - I'm using jQuery to restructure the HTML by putting all photos in its a single div before initiating Packery.
[13:16:49] <boytoy_> But is there a better way of doing it? I tried using CSS to hide everything except the photos, but couldn't get Packery to initiate without restructuring the HTML.
[13:23:42] <sacrebleu> on http://www.cliquevodka.com/index/ I am trying to implement http://workshop.rs/2011/09/news-ticker-in-4-lines-of-jquery/ and if you in firebug place a breakpoint on line 12 of the script, this never happens for some odd reason, version 1.8.0 .. line 12 runs, but the thing it is doing does not work, thoughts?
[13:23:49] <sacrebleu> line is in function ticking_twitter()
[13:24:07] <sacrebleu> i'm aware of a bug report on jquery.com claiming 1.8.0's sliding is broken
[13:27:18] <SporkSpork> How can I get this slide-out contact form to thank the user for submitting? At this point, there's no visual indication. http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/2/
[13:31:36] <ebol4> SporkSpork: You could select the div of the form $('#slideout_inner') and do append() to append a thank you message
[13:31:56] <ebol4> Or you could have a hidden div containing a thank you message inside that slideout
[13:32:05] <ebol4> and then you could just make it not hidden anymore after the user submits
[13:33:52] <SporkSpork> ebol4: Thanks. I'm fairly new, but is there any way to hide the form field and the text above it and show a thank you message? Also, how would I go about making the slider slide back in a few seconds after the "thank you?"
[13:35:42] <ebol4> To hide an element you've selected in jQuery, just do something like, $('.TheThingIamHiding').hide();
[13:36:08] <ebol4> To 'unhide' something, use the .show() function
[13:36:32] <ebol4> So you could have a thank you message that starts out hidden, then use show() to show it once you need to thank the user
[13:36:52] <SporkSpork> And I would just put that in the "submitHandler" section?
[13:37:39] <ebol4> Yeah, after the $.post() part
[13:37:56] <SporkSpork> ebol4: Cool, thanks! I'll try it.
[13:38:37] <ebol4> To do a three second delay (or however many seconds), look at using .delay() http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[13:38:51] <thin> hi
[13:38:59] <thin> could someone explain this line of code to me $(el).siblings(".section.details, .details")[(effect||"slideToggle")]((!effect)?"fast":null)
[13:40:54] <ebol4> SporkSpork: Set timeout like you've got could also work, but delay() would probably be simpler in this situation
[13:41:14] <ebol4> for the hiding it after submitting anyway
[13:42:07] <SporkSpork> ebol4: Right. I'm going to see if I can get the hide/show function to work first
[13:44:12] <beshoo> hi
[13:44:17] <ebol4> Hello
[13:49:59] <DarkGhost`> how come for textareas .val() or .html() doesn't work?
[13:51:16] <ebol4> What is your code that isn't working?
[13:51:20] <ebol4> @DarkGhost
[13:54:16] <ebol4> When using .load(), can you edit the data before it gets loaded into the element?
[13:59:28] <SporkSpork> ebol4: I almost have it working. The input field and submit button hide when I click it. However, the "thank you" div does not show...
[13:59:56] <SporkSpork> Is $("#1").hide(); the correct way to start out hiding the div (right below $(document).ready(function () {
[14:00:45] <eddiemonge> display: none is better
[14:00:47] <ebol4> You can also set that div to be hidden by default in the CSS
[14:00:52] <ebol4> ^
[14:00:57] <eddiemonge> #1 is also not a great id
[14:01:33] <SporkSpork> eddie: I figured. I'll probably change it once it's working... but I think I'm doing something wrong.
[14:02:06] <beshoo> i have to dives http://jsfiddle.net/esPce/1/show/ #2 overlay #1 , now when i want to get the id of the #1 but in the region that #1 contact #2 ,  #jquery return #1 and #2 while mose moving over the #1. i need to return the id of #1 while the mouse is in the one region regadless the overlap , sorry for my english
[14:02:09] <SporkSpork> When I later run the function $('#1').show(); it remains hdiden
[14:02:12] <SporkSpork> *hidden
[14:02:21] <ebol4> SporkSpork: Are you hiding the div that contains the Thank You message?
[14:02:25] <ebol4> like, slideout?
[14:02:31] <SporkSpork> the very same way, yes
[14:02:35] <ebol4> If you hide the parent, the child will be hidden too
[14:03:05] <ebol4> So if you have a div inside a div, if you hide the outer div, everything inside is hidden
[14:03:13] <SporkSpork> oh, that's it
[14:03:59] <beshoo> please advice
[14:05:34] <andrewSC> KILL ME NOW
[14:05:42] <andrewSC> TRYING TO OAUTH WITH PHP IS EPIC FAIL
[14:05:49] <andrewSC> USING CURL WITH HTTPS IN PHP IS EPIC FAIL
[14:06:02] <andrewSC> FUCK CA CERTS
[14:06:17] <Bothering> lool
[14:06:21] <Bothering> comon
[14:06:37] <eddiemonge> si thought oauth in php was rather easy
[14:06:55] <andrewSC> eddiemonge: it would be if the place i worked for actually implemented it by the book
[14:07:20] <andrewSC> instead they the want you to post to an endpoint with a json payload then you get an access token back
[14:08:16] <andrewSC> sounds too simple right?
[14:08:57] <eddiemonge> isnt that what oauth is? post to an endpoint and get an access token back
[14:09:23] <andrewSC> I don't know anymore...
[14:09:44] <andrewSC> I can't even breathe--I'm hysterical
[14:14:22] <dfrey> I have a web page for performing a test on the server.  The user will fill out a bunch of parameters for the test and then press the "go" button.  Then the server will process the request and begin the test.  The client will periodically poll the test status from the server and update a status textarea of the test page until the test completes.  How should I deal with the form data?  If I simply do <form
[14:14:24] <dfrey> action=... then a new page will be loaded when the user presses submit right?  I guess I want to send an ajax request attached to the "go" button, but I would like to submit the form data easily in that request.  Is that possible?
[14:15:17] <fr4nk> hi guys!
[14:15:35] <fr4nk> i have an animation of a div, animating the marginLeft
[14:16:07] <fr4nk> after animation completes, the width() of that div is 0
[14:16:09] <fr4nk> why??
[14:16:54] <Toerkeium> hello guys. I have an .click even which is not working for some reason. How can I troubleshoot this? I have firefox and I'm using the console but it doesn't show anything about this
[14:17:45] <ebol4> Toerkeium: Can I see the .click?
[14:18:00] <ebol4> fr4nk: What animation is causing this?
[14:18:36] <mentoc> Is there any way i can loop through an array without for()?
[14:18:42] <fr4nk> marginLeft: new_head_container.width()
[14:19:00] <fr4nk> where new_head_container is my selector of jquery, just want it selecting once..
[14:19:00] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm having an oddball error happen, Im making a jquery ajax call, and its returning a 200 response, but in the console its highlighted red, and breaks the script…if i change the url in the call and remove the www it works for me, but then other people are complaining it breaks…so either way, its all busted…any idea what this could be?
[14:19:02] <ebol4> mentoc: myArray.forEach(
[14:19:04] <fikst> mentoc, each()
[14:19:04] <Toerkeium> ebol4: sure, I'll post it
[14:19:51] <mentoc> foo = [ {a:'b'} ]; would it be foo.each ?
[14:20:27] <Toerkeium> ebol4: http://www.pastebin.ca/2416189
[14:20:51] <ebol4> fr4nk: I dunno if I'm understanding you correctly, but instead of new_head_container.width(), did you try $(this).width()?
[14:21:20] <fr4nk> jeah i did, but then i got the wrong width, i think if the parent element, dunno
[14:22:07] <Toerkeium> ebol4: the click event should close the dialog, but it sometimes does and sometimes don't
[14:22:17] <ebol4> fr4nk: what about $('new_head_container').width()
[14:22:19] <Toerkeium> I tried many browsers, and all the same behavior
[14:22:58] <mentoc> How would you code a closure that can access a variable outside the scope of the function?
[14:23:17] <fr4nk> ebol4: nope 0 too :-/
[14:23:31] <ebol4> mentoc: It might be better just to pass that variable to the function as an argument
[14:24:32] <ebol4> fr4nk: is new_head_container a div's class? Or what exactly?
[14:25:27] <fr4nk> it is a div's ID   var new_head_container = $('#new_head_container');
[14:26:21] <ebol4> And if you do alert(new_head_container); then what do you get?
[14:26:33] <beshoo>  i have tow dives http://jsfiddle.net/esPce/1/show/ div #2 overlay div #1 , now when i move mouse over #1 but in the region that #1 contact #2 , javascript return #1 and #2. i need to return the id of #1 id ... and when mose over div #2 it return div #2 id and so on ..
[14:27:48] <ebol4> Toerkeium: I'm not seeing anything wrong with the javascript, I dunno what the problem might be, I'm sorry
[14:28:28] <fr4nk> ebol4: Object[div#new_head_container] (console.log())
[14:29:02] <fr4nk> dunni i'm trying actually build it with fiddle, but there the width is correct o.O
[14:29:13] <ebol4> fr4nk: And if you alert(new_head_container.width()) does that give you 0, or the actual width?
[14:29:47] <fr4nk> console.log gives 0
[14:33:37] <ebol4> fr4nk: just a shot in the dark, but I guess some people have problems reading the width if they're using $(document).ready(function(){, and fixed it by using $(window).load(function() { instead
[14:34:01] <bobbobbins> any idea whats up with mine?
[14:35:52] <Toerkeium> ebol4: I open dialog1, from dialog1 I do a click on a button to open dialog2, I click on dialog2 and close dialog2. If I close dialog1 and open it again, dialog2 won't close on click
[14:35:53] <fr4nk> ebol4: hm i dont use ready...i use a button with onclick to start the animation..strange, in jsfiddle it works.... '-.-
[14:35:53] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins: whats the response type? whats the response? is it what the ajax call is expecting?
[14:36:06] <Toerkeium> ebol4: can you imagine where could be the problem?
[14:36:26] <bobbobbins> its a 200 response type, thats what it expects i would imagine
[14:36:26] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: you are doing a dialog from a dialog? eww
[14:36:39] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins: i meant the mime type
[14:36:50] <Toerkeium> I have to mention that I put some alerts in the same place where the dialog.close goes and the alerts works
[14:36:57] <eddiemonge> what kind of ajax call is it? and you might be running into sop
[14:37:20] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: yes, it's one dialog with a form (dialog1) and inside that form, I retrieve data from google which is shown inside another dialog (dialog2)
[14:37:45] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: you cant imagine any other way to represent that?
[14:37:57] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: what do you mean?
[14:38:05] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: its just text/html, as it should be
[14:38:19] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: i mean that doesnt sound like the best ui
[14:38:28] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: why not?
[14:39:19] <eddiemonge> a modal over a modal is weird.
[14:39:50] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: it's a form to fill in hotels information. You open a dialog with an html form, to fill all hotel information, but you fill in the hotel name first, and click on a button aside of the text field, it triggers a google search and it shows the results on another dialog. If you find your hotel, you click the hotel and it fills up all hotel information
[14:40:37] <eddiemonge> why does the first form need to be a modal?
[14:41:04] <fr4nk> ebol4: http://jsfiddle.net/ceSm4/ fyi, my intention was to make a right slide out, get new content into that div and slide it back in from right... well i am out, gn8, thx 4 help :)
[14:41:15] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: you mean why not a pure html link to the form?
[14:41:22] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: it's all working with ajax
[14:41:23] <fr4nk> *from left.. just see jsfiddel XD
[14:42:03] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: ajax has nothing to do with that choice
[14:42:18] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: I can show you if you like...
[14:42:35] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: I don't get what you mean then
[14:42:38] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: if you want. im still going to say its bad
[14:43:00] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: what other way would you present a form to the user?
[14:43:19] <eddiemonge> by presenting a form to the user
[14:43:35] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: heh, I'm not arguing you.. I'm just trying to get your point
[14:43:48] <eddiemonge> link?
[14:43:57] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins: link to your example?
[14:47:17] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: liquidaciones.dnsba.com you must to log in with usr eddie pass eddie
[14:47:31] <Toerkeium> and click on "Agregar Hotel"
[14:48:06] <Bothering> haihaiahi
[14:48:06] <Toerkeium> then put an hotel name on the "Nombre del hotel" text box and click the button with the search icon

[14:50:19] <Toerkeium> bad thing?
[14:50:35] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: i didnt know those were clickable elements without my cursor changing
[14:50:37] <Konda> drugs? I wanna make an variable equal to an image!
[14:50:50] <eddiemonge> and yeah, that modal should be content in the center pane
[14:50:51] <Bothering> Konda: dafuq
[14:51:01] <Toerkeium> ahhh sure, yes, it's just the begining
[14:51:02] <eddiemonge> Konda: what? why?
[14:51:14] <Bothering> nono not what why who
[14:51:16] <Konda> Don't know how to write it out
[14:51:20] <Bothering> just dafuq
[14:51:43] <Bothering> a image is not a variable
[14:52:01] <Konda> Id like to set the image equal to a variable
[14:52:11] <eddiemonge> Konda: var img = "<img src='/path/to/img.jpg' alt='but why mommy?' />"; BOOM done
[14:52:39] <eddiemonge> Konda: or do you mean var img = $("img#havingThisId");  ?
[14:52:44] <Bothering> thats a html image tag
[14:52:48] <Konda> to later use it in an array and make a slideshow :) Thanks! Im gonna try it
[14:53:02] <Bothering> Konda: thats an image tag
[14:53:04] <Bothering> not image
[14:53:16] <Bothering> stop confuz
[14:54:08] <Konda> like var img = $("img#myimage.jpg"); ?
[14:54:16] <Bothering> omfg
[14:54:23] <graphettion> Coke is a hell of a drug.
[14:54:37] <Bothering> just do var img = $('img');
[14:54:37] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s18/sh/11721785-61d2-4873-aa48-6f6f9888d0d6/c595aef0e504a1b5b93c701d640e33de/deep/0/liquidaciones.dnsba.com/index.php.png
[14:55:28] <Bothering> wil that return an array if he has many <img?> tags
[14:55:34] <Bothering> ?
[14:55:37] <eddiemonge> yes
[14:55:40] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: don't get you.. why should be at the left upper corner?
[14:55:41] <eddiemonge> it will return all images
[14:55:43] <Bothering> ok see
[14:55:46] <Konda> Id like it like this: pictures[0] = "C:\xampp\htdocs\myimage.jpeg";
[14:55:57] <Bothering> thats a path
[14:55:58] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: there is no reason for that form to be a modal. it should be the content
[14:56:11] <Bothering> it would be img[0].src
[14:56:12] <eddiemonge> Konda: thats not an image. thats an image path
[14:56:15] <Bothering> no wait
[14:56:15] <Konda> and I would like to print out the image
[14:56:30] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: but you could be doing something else in "content"
[14:56:31] <Bothering> it wud be $(img).attr('src');
[14:56:34] <Bothering> there
[14:57:01] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: why you resist to using 2 level dialogs? is it that bad?
[14:57:08] <eddiemonge> yes
[14:57:24] <eddiemonge> i have to click twice to get back to the content
[14:57:34] <Bothering> nono wait
[14:57:35] <eddiemonge> $(img)[0].src
[14:57:43] <Bothering> ya
[14:57:49] <Bothering> i fukd up
[14:58:00] <eddiemonge> Konda: print to a printer? or display on a screen?
[14:58:02] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: but you're talking from a UI point of view of from a scripting pov?
[14:58:03] <Bothering> no eddiemonge u also fukd up
[14:58:05] <Bothering> lol
[14:58:13] <bobbobbins> eh, its an iis issue, stupid iis

[15:00:27] <Bothering> ya
[15:00:29] <Konda> thanks tho
[15:00:38] <Bothering> thx
[15:01:32] <Toerkeium> so eddiemonge, can you give me a hand with this ? I'm not good with jquery at all as you can see, I'v been all day with this issue with 0 progress
[15:01:44] <Toerkeium> I'm sure it's something silly, but I can't find it
[15:02:29] <eddiemonge> what problem?
[15:02:34] <Toerkeium> lol
[15:02:54] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: the problem with the click event
[15:03:46] <Bothering> ok show us the wizardry
[15:04:23] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge:  I open dialog1, from dialog1 I do a click on a button to open dialog2, I click on dialog2 and close dialog2. If I close dialog1 and open it again, dialog2 won't close on click (all this doing a search on the form, filling the text field "nombre del hotel") and clicking no the search icon
[15:05:17] <Toerkeium> I removed lot of code for testing purposes, but fills the form with the information about the hotel found in google (I'm using the google places api)
[15:08:37] <Toerkeium> it's really strange
[15:09:09] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: seems fine to me
[15:09:12] <eddiemonge> slow
[15:09:34] <Toerkeium> have you tried closing the form and opening it again and doing a search, and clicking on a result?
[15:09:51] <eddiemonge> probably because you arent caching anything, your code is all over the place instead of neat, tidy chunks and you are creating tons of elements instead of re-using
[15:10:24] <Toerkeium> I checked that, it happens even with all data retrieved
[15:11:08] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: wtf, how do i get rid of the alert: http://note.io/166GMIP
[15:11:46] <Toerkeium> lol, with scape
[15:12:28] <eddiemonge> escape doesnt work until i click it.
[15:12:39] <Toerkeium> yes sorry, click on the alert and scape
[15:12:43] <Toerkeium> I have to put a button
[15:12:57] <eddiemonge> the other thing is still working fine for me
[15:13:57] <Toerkeium> if I close the "agregar hotel" form and open it again and I do a search, when I click on a result the dialog containing the result don't close
[15:14:17] <Toerkeium> and don't know what it is and don't know how troubleshoot it
[15:14:53] <Toerkeium> there is nothing being logged in the console, while the alers (both) works. Just the dialog.close in the middle of the alerts is not working
[15:14:57] <Toerkeium> a real pita
[15:15:35] <Toerkeium> I think I'll have to make a new script separated from the proyect, and go step by step
[15:17:52] <ebol4> I'm getting this error when I use load(): Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined
[15:18:05] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: or you could step through the code
[15:18:08] <ebol4> However, the page appears to load everything just fine, but the script stops
[15:18:13] <eddiemonge> ebol4: how are you using it?
[15:18:41] <ebol4> $('.posts').load(pageToGet)
[15:18:59] <ebol4> Where pageToGet = "http://www.theSameWebsite.com/something"
[15:19:16] <ebol4> It seems to be working fine, I don't know why that error happens, but that error causes the script to stop abruptly
[15:20:11] <Toerkeium> ok thanks eddiemonge for your patience, I'll see what I can do
[15:22:27] <eddiemonge> ebol4: have you tried using a relative link?
[15:22:34] <ebol4> I'll give that a try
[15:22:46] <eddiemonge> ebol4: where does the error point to?

[15:26:03] <aleray> hi, I would like to select the element with a [data-exemple] attribute which aren't nested in any other element with the same attribute. How can I do this?
[15:28:11] <eddiemonge> $("[data-example]").filter(function () { return !$(this).closest("[data-example]").length; });
[15:28:49] <eddiemonge> although thats not performant. id look at giving those elements a class or an additional attribute like data-has-no-parent=true
[15:30:45] <Cyclohexane> if i dynamically add content to a table that i have bind events for how do i add bind events to the dynamically added rows?
[15:31:04] <aleray> eddiemonge, thanks
[15:31:28] <eddiemonge> Cyclohexane: delegate the events
[15:32:48] <eddiemonge> Cyclohexane: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:34:04] <Cyclohexane> eddiemonge: i tried using .on() it didn't seem to change anything
[15:35:17] <eddiemonge> did you delegate? did you read that article i sent you? i rewrote it so it should be clear on what delegation is. if its not let me know

[15:46:22] <beshoo> i nned to get id of each elemnt
[15:46:26] <beshoo> jqm
[15:46:55] <eddiemonge> you mean like drag select?
[15:47:01] <SporkSpork> eddiemonge: Thanks. I'm testing it now... somehow I can't see where the hide/show happens.
[15:47:18] <beshoo> yes some thing like that
[15:47:48] <eddiemonge> beshoo: this should answer all of your life questions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Touch_events

[15:49:07] <eddiemonge> ?
[15:49:52] <beshoo> <eddiemonge> the page did not help me much
[15:51:49] <SporkSpork> eddiemonge: Ah, I see. It pops the div back in. Thanks! Any idea, though, how to hide the input box and Submit button and reveal "Thank You" before the window pops back in?
[15:51:55] <beshoo> on native android system we can do that , 10 elemnt , you can tuch the screen and move your finger over the elmeints each elemnts will interact with you , how can i do that in jqm
[15:52:15] <eddiemonge> beshoo: it should have. so you want this but with touch events? http://jsfiddle.net/8ycW9/1/
[15:52:43] <eddiemonge> SporkSpork: use a timer, show the thank you and then after x amount of time call slideOut()
[15:53:54] <beshoo> <eddiemonge> try to open this on your mobile and test
[15:53:59] <beshoo> it will not work
[15:54:01] <SporkSpork> eddiemonge: when I tried this, I was able to hide the input and button but not show the Thank You, because I nested inside the Divs that I was hiding. Where would I insert the Thank You div?
[15:54:27] <beshoo> hover will not work on mobile
[15:59:08] <eddiemonge> beshoo: something like this: ?

[16:06:22] <horacsio> I need to make that with jquery. I know how to toggle a div hide and show… but normally the div hides/shows up or down. I need to both sides go as the gif goes.
[16:06:24] <eddiemonge> you could try asking your teacher
[16:06:33] <horacsio> from top to bottom and bottom to top
[16:06:46] <eddiemonge> ? animate @ horacsio
[16:06:47] <bot-t> horacsio, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/

[16:07:19] <sheilablackrose> hi guys anyone alive?
[16:07:53] <vladikoff> sheilablackrose, no everyone died during the jquery zepto war
[16:08:18] <sheilablackrose> i have multiple <div class="newPage"></div>    how can i say that eact time i click a button it will scroll to the closest newPage
[16:08:21] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:08:31] <sheilablackrose> so this is a zombie appocolypse!
[16:08:32] <eddiemonge> horacsio: it can
[16:08:42] <eddiemonge> vladikoff: who won that?
[16:08:51] <vladikoff> eddiemonge, we all lost :(
[16:09:01] <horacsio> well I can't find the way for that. could you help?
[16:09:08] <eddiemonge> vladikoff: time to go back to prototype?
[16:09:46] <eddiemonge> sheilablackrose: with a log of logic and offset and viewing the click event location
[16:10:04] <eddiemonge> horacsio: hint: opacity with a .hide() in the callback
[16:10:23] <sheilablackrose> ic
[16:10:27] <horacsio> thats not the way… that opacity trick is not a good solution!
[16:10:43] <horacsio> it only dissolves/fades thediv!!!
[16:14:02] <rbs> hey there. I know we have (and I use) .serializeArray() function, so I create a data = form.serializeArray() and POST to the server, but I'm wondering how am I supposed to Load JSON that came from a .get() on the Form
[16:15:12] <shoky> rbs: what do you mean, a .get() on the form?
[16:15:55] <horacsio> so anyone to help?
[16:15:58] <horacsio> anyone can help me doing this toggle: http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/6237/jxz.gif ignore the fade since it's only part of the simulation, ok?
[16:16:54] <eddiemonge> horacsio: you have to animate the height and top position
[16:17:33] <eddiemonge> rbs: there isnt a way. you have to loop through the response, setting the values for each element
[16:17:36] <horacsio> eddiemonge: I have this http://jsfiddle.net/t9yJD/54/ but the div goes down only :(
[16:18:25] <ebol4> eddiemonge: I've written up my problem and provided an example Greasemonkey script that demonstrates my problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17459564/jquery-load-in-greasemonkey-script-produces-cannot-call-method-call-of-unde
[16:18:35] <eddiemonge> horacsio: easy peasy http://jsfiddle.net/t9yJD/55/
[16:18:42] <mentoc> is it possible to chain events to a single function? for example: $("#foo").change.keyup.click(function(){ blah; }); ?
[16:19:07] <eddiemonge> .on('change keyup', function()
[16:19:49] <mentoc> eddiemonge: thanks, I actually found bind can do that as well.. would there be a speed diff?
[16:20:24] <horacsio> eddiemonge: you just move the top! :D this should be a div with the availability to be toggled! can you press the click again? :D
[16:21:23] <eddiemonge> horacsio: im not doing everything for you. unless you want me to. i charge $75 an hour
[16:21:34] <eddiemonge> ?on @ mentoc
[16:21:34] <bot-t> mentoc, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:21:45] <toxz> what is the difference here? http://jsfiddle.net/u2wAy/
[16:21:56] <eddiemonge> bind =  bind: function() { on() };
[16:22:02] <horacsio> eddiemonge how much time you need to do that?
[16:22:22] <eddiemonge> toxz: one is anonymouse, the other isnt
[16:22:32] <eddiemonge> lol anony mouse
[16:22:38] <mentoc> I've noticed bind doesn't always bind in my code
[16:22:48] <rbs> eddiemonge well. on this case, since the variable name from the server side is the same of the field name on form client-side, maybe I can simply write up a functiion that receive the json result and load it up automatically.... makes sense?
[16:23:36] <toxz> eddiemonge: but it works the same? http://jsfiddle.net/u2wAy/1/
[16:24:34] <toxz> eddiemonge: sorry this it better - http://jsfiddle.net/u2wAy/3/
[16:26:09] <toxz> eddiemonge: sorry this is even better - http://jsfiddle.net/u2wAy/4/
[16:26:50] <horacsio> eddiemonge how much time you need to do that?
[16:27:04] <eddiemonge> horacsio: that much time http://jsfiddle.net/t9yJD/56/
[16:27:17] <eddiemonge> mentoc: bind call on internally
[16:27:49] <eddiemonge> toxz: yes, there is no difference in that regard
[16:28:08] <horacsio> eddiemonge: that was a fraction of an hour...
[16:28:55] <toxz> eddiemonge: mmmmm thx. so there is just a "semantic" difference
[16:29:31] <eddiemonge> horacsio: i charge a minimum one hour. then round to quarter hour after that
[16:29:48] <eddiemonge> toxz: no. there are differences in when/how they are used
[16:30:22] <eddiemonge> toxz: http://kangax.github.io/nfe/
[16:30:50] <eddiemonge> "In a nutshell, named function expressions are useful for one thing only — descriptive function names in debuggers and profilers. "

[16:40:09] <eddiemonge> Goopyo: do you know what history.pushState does?
[16:40:22] <Goopyo> adds to the history...
[16:40:32] <eddiemonge> Goopyo: have you read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history ?
[16:40:54] <Goopyo> Briefly yes
[16:41:56] <Goopyo> eddiemonge: know something I dont?
[16:42:07] <Goopyo> please shed light
[16:43:31] <eddiemonge> are you using history.pushState('state', 'title', 'url')?
[16:51:05] <ebol4> eddiemonge: Are you still there?

[17:37:15] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have multiple <div class="newPage"></div>    how can i say that eact time i click a button it will scroll to the closest .newPage
[17:39:34] <jtal> I'm no expert here but you could set something like ID to be a number 1,2,3, etc... when a .class is clicked, you could get the id, increment it, then try to scroll there?
[17:39:55] <jtal> or maybe you could use anchors and just make each div link to the next anchor
[17:40:00] <jtal> yeah that sounds good
[17:40:12] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:40:14] <sheilablackrose> ok ill try that
[17:40:22] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[17:44:39] <jtal> then you just have to style that stuff
[17:58:19] <sheilablackrose> how do i get the current position of an element in the screen?
[18:03:10] <CWSpear> sheilablackrose, there are position and offset methods that return and object with x and y positions
[18:03:27] <CWSpear> $('.selector').offset(); // { x: 100, y: 150 }
[18:03:30] <CWSpear> something like that
[18:04:14] <sheilablackrose> i did try offset but it gives the position of the element to th etop right? but if i'm like in mid screen (while scrolling) it still returns the same values
[18:04:22] <sheilablackrose> i used offset().top
[18:04:48] <sheilablackrose> or even better is there a way to stop scrolling when a classs is reached
[18:04:48] <sheilablackrose> ?
[18:05:18] <sheilablackrose> i have a button than automaticly scrolls the page i just want it to stop when a specific class is reach
[18:05:25] <sheilablackrose> is that possible?
[18:05:54] <tw2113> i'd probably grab the offset for the button
[18:06:01] <tw2113> and then compare the offset values
[18:06:39] <sheilablackrose> let me read up on offset i think i might be using the wrong one. offset().top
[18:06:43] <CWSpear> I've seen addons that do that
[18:06:59] <CWSpear> trigger events when you scroll to a certain part
[18:07:13] <CWSpear> and maybe you're picking the wrong element? and it should count up from the top left, which is 0, 0
[18:07:27] <CWSpear> and yeah, I can never remember position vs offest, lol
[18:07:44] <sheilablackrose> cwsspear something like when u scroll down a page it will stop or pause at specific locations
[18:07:45] <sheilablackrose> ?
[18:07:52] <sheilablackrose> is there like a jquery method to do that?
[18:08:53] <CWSpear> not by default, but you can compare the offset and the scroll position and stuff
[18:09:07] <CWSpear> I was just saying I've seen plugins that have scroll callbacks.
[18:09:14] <sheilablackrose> ahh position let me try that
[18:10:52] <CWSpear> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/ <— sheilablackrose
[18:10:57] <CWSpear> I think that's what you're looking for
[18:11:04] <sheilablackrose> let me check
[18:11:32] <CWSpear> when you scroll to that item, it triggers that function (in this case, when you scroll to .thing, it will alert "Top of thing hit top of viewport.")
[18:12:38] <sheilablackrose> ic ill download that and play around with it
[18:12:39] <sheilablackrose> thank you
[18:12:53] <CWSpear> yeah, let me know
[18:14:31] <sheilablackrose> yupp
[18:23:21] <zim> Hi all. Got a strange one. I am changing the value of a data attribute with attr() then trying to use it with a var data = $(this).data() but the value in data is the old value. hope that makes some sense :-)
[18:24:04] <CWSpear> yes, I've ecountered this, too
[18:24:15] <CWSpear> [data-attr] != .date('attr')
[18:25:05] <CWSpear> necessarily
[18:25:27] <CWSpear> zim, I've always just been consistent with out I set/get it. Always use 'attr' or 'data'
[18:27:24] <zim> so if I $('.foo').attr('data-path', 'new value'); then var data = $(this).data(); why is data.path != new value?
[18:27:29] <shoky> zim: .data() only reads the data-* attributes the first time you use it on an element
[18:28:23] <zim> I get that but I am using it after I change it with a on('click')
[18:28:48] <CWSpear> Right. So the value won't update, so you need to access it with .attr('data-path')
[18:29:07] <sheilablackrose> cwspear how do i stop a scroll?
[18:29:15] <shoky> zim: if you don't have a special reason why it should be an attribute and not just data, just use .data()
[18:30:10] <CWSpear> sheilablackrose, body: { overflow: hidden; }?
[18:30:18] <CWSpear> but that's bad UX
[18:30:26] <zim> can I change an elements data with .data() ?
[18:30:33] <shoky> of course
[18:30:43] <zim> TY will go RFM
[18:30:44] <shoky> (but not its attribute)
[18:30:49] <sheilablackrose> not disable scrolling. just stop a scroll
[18:32:22] <CWSpear> sheilablackrose…? what do you mean stop a scroll?
[18:32:32] <CWSpear> how is that different then disabling it?
[18:32:56] <sheilablackrose> like when a user is scrolling down a site. using that plugin  $('.homePageHeaderDiv').waypoint(function (direction) {
[18:32:57] <sheilablackrose>                 alert('Top of thing hit top of viewport.');
[18:32:57] <sheilablackrose>             });
[18:33:03] <sheilablackrose> instead of alert i want it to stop scrolling
[18:33:06] <sheilablackrose> momntarilly
[18:33:08] <sheilablackrose> like pause
[18:34:14] <CWSpear> $('body').css('overflow', 'hidden');
[18:34:14] <CWSpear> setTimeout(function() {
[18:34:14] <CWSpear>     $('body').css('overflow', 'auto');
[18:34:14] <CWSpear> }, 2000);
[18:34:17] <CWSpear> but that's so bad
[18:34:26] <CWSpear> but that would "pause it" for 2 seconds (2000 miliseconds
[18:36:32] <xyxne> sheilablackrose, that sounds like frustrating UI
[18:37:02] <dismist> or tactful marketing if they are hunting immediately for something below the fold
[18:37:23] <sheilablackrose> probably not what i was looking for
[18:37:40] <sheilablackrose> i think what i want is simple but im confusing you guys
[18:37:49] <sheilablackrose> wait let me try explaining in a different way
[18:39:51] <SporkSpork> Why is it that when I click "Submit," this slider stops responding to my cursor position and stays in its slide-out position? http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/4/
[18:40:39] <CWSpear> SporkSpork, it appears to be working fo rme
[18:40:41] <CWSpear> for me*
[18:41:18] <SporkSpork> CWSpear: Really? Does it slide back in after you click "Submit?"
[18:41:51] <CWSpear> after I move my mouse away, yes
[18:41:56] <SporkSpork> On my end, once it submits the form data and says "Thanks," the form stays slid-out.
[18:41:57] <SporkSpork> huh
[18:42:18] <CWSpear> what browser are yo uusing?
[18:42:29] <shoky> SporkSpork: it stays slid-out because you're still hovering it
[18:42:54] <SporkSpork> Actually, I know what's going on. It doesn't show the error on jsfiddle, because its unable to submit the form data to MySQL
[18:43:16] <SporkSpork> *it's
[18:43:57] <CWSpear> It does what you describe if my console it's closed… but it works if my console is open?
[18:44:02] <SporkSpork> but on a working page, the text changes to say "Thanks," the input field and submit button are hidden, and the div remains in slide-out position, even when the cursor goes away.
[18:44:24] <CWSpear> I think something weird was happening
[18:44:30] <CWSpear> what does your callback do in the jQuery?
[18:44:59] <SporkSpork> CWSpear: Not sure what you mean. I'm very new to this
[18:45:23] <CWSpear> so is there an error when it does the stuff that changes the text to say "Thanks?
[18:45:23] <CWSpear> "
[18:45:55] <SporkSpork> No error, I just haven't put in any code to tell the slider how to react.
[18:45:56] <sheilablackrose> guys please check this out http://jsfiddle.net/55jnk/3/
[18:46:08] <SporkSpork> And I'm not sure where to put that code, or even what code to put in.
[18:46:20] <shoky> SporkSpork: i think it's just the timing issue
[18:46:27] <shoky> SporkSpork: if you submit it in the first 3 seconds
[18:46:38] <shoky> then your timeout adds back the active class after the submit removes it
[18:46:52] <SporkSpork> shoky: Ah, you're right.
[18:47:13] <SporkSpork> any way to fix that?
[18:47:20] <shoky> clear the timeout?
[18:47:29] <SporkSpork> upon submit?
[18:47:33] <shoky> sure
[18:47:40] <shoky> or upon hover if you want
[18:47:57] <SporkSpork> what would I type to clear upon hover?
[18:49:14] <shoky> you can use .hover or .on('mouseenter'  i suppose
[18:49:27] <SporkSpork> ah, cool. Thanks!
[18:50:01] <CWSpear> sorry guys, gotta go
[18:50:13] <SporkSpork> Bye CWSpear. Thanks for the help.
[18:54:26] <SporkSpork> shoky: Just tried .on('mouseenter'... but now the tab never pops out at all: http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/5/
[18:59:23] <shoky> SporkSpork:  .on is a method of jquery objects
[18:59:54] <shoky> you're just calling it on nothing, or on the setTimeout return value. also you're clearing the wrong timeout
[19:01:32] <ebol4> Still having this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17459564/
[19:01:59] <shoky> SporkSpork: you're also missing a comma.. check your console
[19:02:31] <ebol4> I've tried ajax(), get(), load(), and even gm_xmlHttpRequest, all produce that error when appending the response to a div
[19:05:31] <SporkSpork> shoky: .on('mouseenter', '#slideout', function() {
[19:05:53] <shoky> SporkSpork:  method of a jquery object means you call it on a jquery object.  $('#slideout')  is a jquery object
[19:06:03] <SporkSpork> oh
[19:06:10] <shoky> ?on
[19:06:10] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:17:13] <sheilablackrose> hi guys if i have a couple of div with the same class how can i get the closest one using scroltop
[19:31:12] <delinquentme> if im calling a function like this:
[19:31:13] <delinquentme> $(this).measurementList('editMeasurementId');
[19:31:26] <delinquentme> and editMeasurementId ... accepts in an argument
[19:31:33] <delinquentme> how can I send that arg in
[19:37:50] <SporkSpork> shoky: I think I have it right now... can you please confirm? Sorry for my newness; I'm learning, I think. http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/7/
[19:45:47] <tw2113> gross, i'm hearing a lot of booms outside
[19:52:44] <SporkSpork> Can someone tell me why line 17-20 is not working correctly? http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/8/
[21:03:26] <ebol4> After my GreaseMonkey script runs in Firefox, I get the error TypeError: window.eval is undefined @ jquery-1.10.0.js:612
[21:03:33] <ebol4> That line in jQuery.js points to....
[21:03:47] <ebol4> 				window[ "eval" ].call( window, data );
[21:27:10] <warden23> Hello, is it possible to do something like this website effect when you click on a profile: http://appear.dk/ but I want it so when someone enters my domain it shows 2 div like panels with my logo in the middle and they pull apart and fade upto top and bottom as the website finishes load?
[21:27:40] <warden23> Plus only does it if they key in the domain in the URL bar not when they click on the 'home' button.
[21:32:38] <warden23> Or in simple terms: On frontpage first load 2 div's are shown and then disappear within 2 seconds? Is that possible
[21:33:42] <ebol4> Sure, you'd just load the two divs, and then run a timer for two seconds before hide()'ing them
[21:36:05] <warden23> Can I make it only show on first load?
[21:36:20] <warden23> Because I don't want it to appear everytime they hit the 'home' button when navigating the website.
[21:39:14] <ebol4> What are you using server-side?
[21:41:53] <warden23> php
[21:42:07] <warden23> I think that's what you mean? Sorry still learning, what do you mean by 'server-side'
[21:42:30] <warden23> HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP
[21:43:22] <warden23> Building my site alongside Wordpress also.
[21:43:42] <warden23> I know the basics of jQuery just still learning, hence why here.
[21:45:23] <warden23> I know I have to implement a jQuery script with cookies.
[21:45:56] <warden23> Because that way it'll only load the once and as long as they don't kill their cookies it'll be happy. If they do it'll just load on first load again, which is fine.
[21:46:57] <warden23> Trying everywhere to find advice and a tutorial but I'm stumped.
[21:51:53] <warden23> hmm maybe if i can reverse this some how: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/hide-div-only-the-first-time but the cookie.js he links no longer exists sigh...
[22:18:25] <ebol4> warden: Are you still around?
[22:19:38] <ebol4> warden23: You can use cookies from Javascript: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp
[22:20:06] <ebol4> Just set up a cookie that tracks whether or not the user has seen the div disappear or not
[22:27:37] <warden23> ebol4: thanks)
[22:39:24] <user_corrupt> Im using fancybox to open youtube videos on my site, but I'm having difficulties in figuring out how to make the video player smaller, while keeping the aspect ratio accurate... simply adding "width:600px" when I call fancybox reduces the width, but the height satys the same... here is the site: www.libertycrusaders.com
[22:41:55] <therealklanni> Well this is a bit baffling. I added a jqueryui spinner to my page and it's there, but for whatever reason it came up as 2px by 2px
[22:42:14] <tw2113> my type of content user_corrupt
[22:42:34] <therealklanni> I am using another spinner elsewhere on the page and that one is fine, so I can't imagine why this one shows up only 2px square
[22:42:50] <user_corrupt> tw2113: awesome man, contribute some comments and help spread the word!
[22:43:36] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2398420/fancybox-resize-width
[22:44:23] <therealklanni> Can anyone offer any suggestion why a jqueryui spinner might show up as only 2px square?
[22:45:32] <tw2113> css affecting it?
[22:46:28] <therealklanni> nope
[22:47:37] <therealklanni> the only css is on the input and that's set to 4mm by 11mm
[22:48:48] <cmckinnel> hey all, i'm using ajaxStart() to show a loading gif but i have more than one loading gif on the same page. when the second and subsequent loading gifs show, the ones before it show at the same time as they're still listening to the ajaxStart() event. how can i tell them to stop listening to the event?
[22:49:08] <therealklanni> jqui wraps your input in a span for the spinner widget, and it's that span that (for whatever reason) is getting set as 2px square
[22:49:22] <therealklanni> Though, like I said, the other spinner on the page doesn't do this
[22:53:32] <therealklanni> Actually, if I look at the calculated styles, that says width/height 0px
[22:53:52] <therealklanni> The tooltip on the element from devtools says 2px though
[22:54:00] <therealklanni> Probably irrelevant
[22:55:42] <therealklanni> computed style*
[22:57:34] <hemangpatel> Hi..
[22:59:57] <hemangpatel> jquery.parseJSON not working in IE 9
[23:01:05] <Cork> hemangpatel: jquery 2.0?
[23:01:25] <hemangpatel> Cork : let me check version
[23:03:06] <hemangpatel> Cork : It's v1.7.1
[23:03:50] <Cork> hmm
[23:04:33] <hemangpatel> it's working in IE 10
[23:04:39] <hemangpatel> IE sucks
[23:05:18] <hemangpatel> Cork : do i try new one ?
[23:05:55] <Cork> it's up to you
[23:06:01] <Cork> 2.0 doesn't have ie8 support
[23:06:18] <tw2113> 2.0 is prejudiced against dinosaurs
[23:06:53] <hemangpatel> I need IE 9 support
[23:07:03] <lenswipee> ie8 is still very important
[23:07:51] <tw2113> only to people who value the people still on the browser version
[23:08:39] <Cork> hemangpatel: http://jsbin.com/azocon/3 works just fine here
[23:08:57] <Cork> tested in ie9 that is
[23:14:48] <hemangpatel> Cork : I have json like this , http://pastie.org/private/vpkc0c4lxyebrrpyrlzpq
[23:14:53] <hemangpatel> may be that's problem
[23:15:10] <Cork> don't think so
[23:15:21] <Cork> hemangpatel: try updating the jsbin
[23:16:09] <hemangpatel> Cork : http://jsbin.com/azocon/4/edit
[23:16:16] <hemangpatel> not working
[23:18:08] <Cork> hmm
[23:18:09] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/azocon/6/edit
[23:19:55] <hemangpatel> Cork : what can i do ?
[23:21:13] <Cork> hemangpatel: this is not something you would get problem with in a normal json sent from a server
[23:21:33] <Cork> hemangpatel: but you need to double escape when you put it inside javascript
[23:21:58] <Cork> meaning \" becomes '\\"'
[23:22:07] <nafg_> Hi, I have a question that's not about jquery. It's about using https. Where should I ask it?
[23:22:35] <Cork> nafg_: is it about certs or what?
[23:23:00] <nafg_> Cork: No, about which parts should use it. site planning.
[23:23:23] <Cork> nafg_: in my book, either you use it or you don't
[23:23:31] <Cork> jumping back and forth is kinda silly
[23:23:59] <Cork> nafg_: but basically, if there is a login you should use https
[23:24:10] <Cork> (from when you start the login)
[23:25:15] <nafg_> Cork: okay, this site is 95% static, only one page lets you make a donation by submitting a credit card.
[23:25:23] <nafg_> Would you still say to make the whole site https?
[23:25:36] <nafg_> No login.
[23:25:45] <nafg_> No cookies
[23:25:50] <Cork> not necessary
[23:26:10] <nafg_> meaning?
[23:26:13] <Cork> but from where you let the user enter the information you SHOULD be https
[23:26:36] <Cork> or should probably say MUST there...
[23:26:53] <nafg_> Does the page that renders the form need it, or only the page that it submits to?
[23:27:04] <Cork> both
[23:27:19] <nafg_> okay, curious what is the benefit of the first?
[23:27:22] <Cork> when the user starts typing, everything loaded needs to be https
[23:27:30] <Cork> nafg_: else you don't protect anything
[23:27:45] <nafg_> How is that?
[23:27:48] <Cork> a third party could inject a sniffing script and grab the content
[23:27:59] <Cork> http can be modified in transit
[23:28:08] <Cork> (and many do)
[23:28:16] <nafg_> nothing sensitive is being rendered (server->client), only submitted (client->server)
[23:28:33] <Cork> nafg_: are you trying to protect you or the client? :D
[23:28:55] <nafg_> just trying to understand the danger of rendering the form in http and submitting https
[23:28:57] <Cork> if the client loads a form with a sniffing script in it and start to type in there information
[23:29:01] <Cork> how are they safe?
[23:29:07] <nafg_> Ah now I understand
[23:29:20] <nafg_> I didn't realize what "sniffing script" meant at first, okay got it
[23:29:43] <Cork> nafg_: and remember https means images, scripts, css everything
[23:30:00] <Cork> one resource loaded over http is enough to make a risk
[23:30:25] <nafg_> okay, so as long as the server can do anything on https, and images etc. have relative paths, that would be easy to do
[23:30:38] <Cork> yes
[23:30:53] <nafg_> So basically what I have to do is the donate page should redirect to https if it's accessed via http
[23:31:12] <nafg_> Anything else to do (besides provisioning)
[23:31:23] <hemangpatel> Cork : will str_replace in php thanks
[23:31:40] <Cork> hemangpatel: why don't you just use json_encode?
[23:31:53] <Cork> nafg_: make sure you don't store information you don't need in the database
[23:32:16] <hemangpatel> Cork : it's output of json_encode. that creates slashes
[23:32:42] <nafg_> okay, check, I just forward straight to authorize.net
[23:32:56] <Cork> hemangpatel: yes, and it should be correct without the need for str_replace
[23:33:13] <nafg_> "synchronously"
[23:33:15] <Cork> hemangpatel: are you storing the json in a <script> tag?
[23:33:38] <Cork> nafg_: nice, then ya you should be fairly safe
[23:34:09] <Cork> nafg_: be sure to escape the content in the form elements if you putput things in the html
[23:34:20] <nafg_> Great, thanks Cork, I really appreciate it!
[23:34:20] <Cork> ex for refill the form on validation failure
[23:34:50] <nafg_> what?
[23:34:52] <Cork> nafg_: else you could get something like a post from a third party with a script in one of the fields and you would xss your self
[23:35:24] <nafg_> oh I missed one line
[23:35:28] <hemangpatel> Cork : no
[23:36:11] <Cork> nafg_: something like https://example.com/doante.php?message=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27injection%27)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cspan%20id%3D%22
[23:36:34] <nafg_> Cork: okay, check on that too. I use Scala/Lift so the html is not done as a string but a dom structure, and strings are automatically escaped
[23:37:01] <Cork> nafg_: if the page does <input name="message" value="<?php echo $_GET['message']; ?>"> it can be quite ugly
[23:37:20] <Cork> hemangpatel: then you don't need it; it's not the problem
[23:37:22] <nafg_> So you would get &lt;script&gt;
[23:37:32] <nafg_> Cork: I didn't understand the last reference
[23:37:42] <nafg_> Oh yes
[23:37:46] <Cork> :)
[23:37:56] <Cork> nafg_: that is a basic example of xss
[23:38:17] <Cork> so make sure to html escape the values for the fields
[23:38:20] <nafg_> sorry I'm a bit slow, also it's confusing because sometimes my messages go between two of yours, and so I don't realize it's a continuation
[23:38:45] <nafg_> So like I said, that couldn't happen here since we're not doing low-level raw strings
[23:39:13] <Cork> nafg_: i'm just listing things you should take extra care of
[23:39:23] <Cork> how you do it is your problem :)
[23:40:07] <nafg_> scala> val msg = "<script>alert('')</script>"; <input value={msg}/>
[23:40:07] <nafg_> msg: java.lang.String = <script>alert('')</script>
[23:40:07] <nafg_> res0: scala.xml.Elem = <input value="&lt;script&gt;alert('')&lt;/script&gt;"></input>
[23:40:13] <b-ot> nafg_: No output.
[23:40:32] <Cork> ok good
[23:40:38] * therealklanni pats b-ot's head
[23:40:39] <nafg_> Okay thanks a million
[23:40:42] <Cork> except for the extra </input> but anyway :)
[23:41:15] <nafg_> yes I'm not actually using that code, just illustrating how scala's type safety works
[23:41:27] <Cork> ya, i understand
