[00:00:49] <molavy> i want create confirmbox, this it anywhere i need. i showup confirm box but dont return 0 or 1 for act in main function,at second i dont know how to prevent loop in form submit and how to really submit form whether if confirm box return true
[00:01:09] <Lundy> what im trying to do is when you click on a Product, it checks to see if the hidden input is there and if it isnt make it, else +1 into the value
[00:02:48] <ServerSage> molavy: Why not use a modal popup instead?
[00:06:54] <Lundy> misterm ?
[00:07:32] <misterm> hm?
[00:07:53] <molavy> for beauty style
[00:08:25] <molavy> please don't ask unrelated question
[00:10:02] <misterm> molavy: it sounds like what you need to do is store the result of the confirm box somewhere
[00:10:22] <Deeply> so in jquery var $newtext; ?
[00:10:27] <misterm> caprtue form submit, check if theyve comfirmed, if so submit the form, otherwise make them confirm
[00:11:52] <misterm> Deeply: in jquery what?
[00:12:59] <Trudko> Guys I need to remove next element but only if it is <br />
[00:12:59] <amit_usual> hi all how can I submit a form in jquery
[00:13:29] <amit_usual> is something like this valid document.getElementsByName("approve_purchase_form" + counter).submit is not a function

[00:14:31] <L4suicide> does anyone here use jquery latest with greasemonkey? I'm having trouble getting gm to require jquery..
[00:14:43] <misterm> amit_usual: are you using jQuery?
[00:14:55] <amit_usual> misterm : yes
[00:14:59] <L4suicide> and can anyone suggest a neat test to see if jquery is included properly :/
[00:15:20] <molavy> when i change "return true" to alert(true); it really show alert box,but i can use it in main function for submit form
[00:15:36] <amit_usual> misterm : document.getElementsByName('approve_purchase_form'+counter).sumit will this work
[00:15:42] <molavy> sorry, i can't use ...
[00:15:49] <Deeply> trying to get the other one to run
[00:15:56] <Deeply> hang on
[00:15:58] <misterm> amit_usual: then why are you using document.getElementsByName?
[00:17:11] <amit_usual> misterm $getElementsByName('approve_purchase_form'+counter).submit would this work
[00:17:20] <misterm> L4suicide: you mean in a script, or that you yourself can do to check?
[00:17:38] <misterm> amit_usual: no
[00:17:42] <Trudko> Guys I need to remove next element but only if it is <br />
[00:18:13] <L4suicide> im trying to write a script in gm, i've copied the line which should include jquery from a script that works, but it seems my script (which works on jsfiddle) doesnt work past anything which has $() in it
[00:18:37] <Lundy> how can I check to see if a hidden input has been created?
[00:18:51] <L4suicide> not sure how to confirm my suspicions about whether jsquery just hasnt been referenced properly
[00:19:18] <molavy> any idea?
[00:19:26] <Lundy> iv got this at the moment but I just get alert("test"); http://jsfiddle.net/dXa88/2/
[00:19:41] <misterm> L4suicide: you can check for the jQuery object
[00:20:21] <misterm> that is the "jQuery" object, I wouldnt check for $ because thats not neccesarily jQuery
[00:20:49] <misterm> Lundy: you seem to have the right idea, write a selector for it and see if its there
[00:21:46] <Prot> Can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/peRvp/2/
[00:21:47] <Prot> not sure why siblings/filter/children work differently than find()
[00:22:24] <eml> I'm trying to make a <div id="table"> .selectable(). $("#table").selectable(); yields Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'selectable' - suggestions?
[00:22:35] <Lundy> misterm: what do u mean sorry

[00:22:58] <Bodanski> I am building multiple slide out panels for my website, I currently have them disappear when the others clicked but the problem I am face is having the button return to the open state. Anyone have any idea on how to fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/Gxtek/
[00:23:13] <misterm> Lundy: it's just like how you would find out if your feet are there...you just look at them
[00:23:28] <molavy> how can i small this code .parent().parent().parent().remove(
[00:23:33] <misterm> Lundy: find some property of the input you are looking for, and use that to write a selector for it
[00:24:04] <misterm> maybe the input has a certain id, then you would try $("#someid") and see if it contains anything
[00:24:47] <molavy> how can i small this code $(this).parent().parent().parent().remove()
[00:27:03] <Deeply> ok
[00:28:49] <Deeply> here is the one that works: http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Nvutn/
[00:29:18] <Deeply> here is the one that doesn't: http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/86GRF/
[00:30:05] <Deeply> in the one that works if you type aa|bb@ in the barcode field, it fills in the other 2 boxes and pops up an alert
[00:30:27] <Deeply> in the other one you type the same thing and nothing happens
[00:32:04] <eml> http://jsfiddle.net/jMDVm/2/ should this not make the div draggable?
[00:32:52] <eml> I'm getting errors that I don't quite understand.
[00:33:39] <molavy> who can i after use event.preventDefault(); then if need tell do Default
[00:33:58] <molavy> who can i after use event.preventDefault(); then if need tell do Default event
[00:34:38] <eml> I was missing jquery-ui of course.
[00:35:28] <molavy> any idea?
[00:36:11] <misterm> molavy: whats the problem exactly?
[00:36:22] <misterm> molavy: if you want the default to happen, don't do preventDefault
[00:36:37] <misterm> molavy: if you want it to happen sometimes and not others, you need to have some sort of check
[00:37:01] <misterm> molavy: if( whatever_you_want) { event.preventDefault() }
[00:37:10] <molavy> all about this code:http://jsfiddle.net/mUpAm/
[00:37:42] <misterm> yea, you want them to confirm before submitting right?
[00:38:03] <misterm> so check if theyve confirmed or not, and if they have confirmed dont display the confirm and dont prevent default
[00:38:26] <molavy> i want create confirmbox, use it anywhere i need. it showup confirm box and return 0 or 1 for act in main function but i can't use it form submitting or prevent submitting a delete form,at second i dont know how to prevent loop in form submit and how to really submit form whether if confirm box return true
[00:39:15] <misterm> molavy: you might want to find some javascript tutorials and work your way through them
[00:39:35] <misterm> molavy: that should give you the foundation you need to do that

[00:47:36] <Deeply> yep
[00:47:53] <Deeply> i changed one thing and ran it and then it wouldn't let me edit the code anymore
[00:57:03] <adamramadhan> ok how about ip ?
[00:57:09] <Deeply> hmmm found one problem
[00:57:20] <Trudko> guys how to find out what tage name element(jquery) object has?

[00:58:43] <Deeply> ok
[01:00:11] <Deeply> $newtxt = $('barcode').val(); is the jquery equivalent of     newtxt = document.getElementById('barcode').value; right?
[01:01:17] <ablomen> Deeply, $('#barcode').val()
[01:01:29] <ablomen> but yes
[01:01:32] <seutje> yea, think css

[01:04:02] <Deeply> ok i'm trying to figure out what I broke
[01:06:15] <dodfr> hi
[01:06:30] <dr0id> hi
[01:07:48] <fire> Hi, is there a tutorial how can i create an jquery/ajax pagination with prev/next button?
[01:08:22] <dodfr> I am using $.cookie plugin and notice a problem with cookie size limitation baceuse it do encodeURIComponent before saving it, so question is, is the encode URI needed if I JSON.stringify what I need to save ? I did a $.cookie_no_URI_encode and it seems to work fine.
[01:08:34] <dodfr> s/baceuse/because
[01:09:02] <adamramadhan> btw who owns jsonip.appspot.com ?
[01:09:15] <Lundy> heya guys, anyone know how I could do a "onclick" insert a hidden input, but if its already set then just update the value?
[01:10:36] <Lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/gLrCa/ this is what iv got at the moment but am not sure
[01:10:49] <Lundy> it just keeps making more hidden inputs
[01:11:03] <dodfr> Lundy : not sure to understand what you mean ? you want to call onClick event when field is hidden ?
[01:11:27] <fire> Lundy: if - else, $(<my-hidden>).length, $('<input type="hidden" />').attr('id', 'newHidden');, $(<my-hidden>).val(<new-val>)
[01:11:45] <Deeply> ok changing things one at a time until i find out where it breaks :)
[01:12:36] <Lundy> dodfr: when a staff member clicks on a Package, I want a hidden input to be created with id_(PACKAGE_ID) and value=1 then if they click it again it just updates the value to 2
[01:14:01] <dodfr> Lundy : ok I understand now
[01:14:28] <fire> Lundy: if ($(yourhidden).length) { $(yourhidden).val(newval); } else { $('<input id="newHidden" type="hidden" />').attr('val', newval); }
[01:18:49] <cheater_> hi
[01:19:09] <cheater_> is get() a standard function in jquery objects?
[01:20:32] <Lundy> fire: http://jsfiddle.net/gLrCa/2/
[01:21:05] <dodfr> Lundy : why do you '$' in your append ? this will move and not add
[01:22:05] <Lundy> the append has been quotes out
[01:22:22] <Deeply> ok now i have to click the alert twice but it sort of works
[01:23:20] <Lundy> :(
[01:24:23] <Lundy>  dodfr: what do u mean
[01:24:29] <fire> Lundy: try to append the new checkbox to your document.
[01:25:16] <Lundy> fire: http://jsfiddle.net/NmAgY/1/ thats the code im currently using
[01:26:01] <sikor_sxe> hello, i have  problem, that i as an ajax response i got an xml string of which i extract an element: "var test = $(xml).find("body").children();" won't show in google chrome when using "$(".editor").html(test);". There is no problem in firefox however. anyone knows what could be the issue?
[01:26:08] <pigiman> Lundy, sorry I wasn't here. what are you trying to do ?
[01:26:26] <Deeply> heh
[01:26:28] <Deeply> ok
[01:26:29] <cheater_> hmm i guess it isn't
[01:26:33] <sikor_sxe> "$(".editor").html("<b>bla</b>");" works fine in chrome, btw
[01:26:37] <Deeply> look like I'm not going to get this to work at all.
[01:26:51] <fire> $('#target').append($('<input id="id_' + $(this).attr('name') + '" type="text" />').attr('val', "1")); try something like this
[01:27:14] <pigiman> Deeply, can you share you problem again?
[01:27:32] <Deeply> I have a barcode scanner
[01:27:48] <Deeply> let me get my working URL
[01:28:32] <fire> now it works
[01:28:50] <fire> Lundy: use this $('#target').append($('<input id="id_' + $(this).attr('name') + '" type="text" />').attr('val', "1")); in your else statement
[01:29:12] <Deeply> pigiman
[01:29:14] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Nvutn/
[01:29:32] <Deeply> in the barcode field, put ID|PW@
[01:29:41] <Deeply> and it should pop up a window right away
[01:30:10] <dodfr> sikor : "$(".editor").html(test);"   do you really mean double quote everywhere ? try single quote "$('.editor').html(test);"
[01:30:33] <pigiman> Deeply, ok and whats your problem ?
[01:30:46] <Deeply> I tried converting it to jQuery
[01:30:50] <Deeply> and I broke it
[01:31:09] <pigiman> can you show the broken code to?
[01:31:10] <Deeply> the alert doesn't work right, and there are a couple of other problems
[01:31:12] <Deeply> yes
[01:31:14] <Deeply> one moment
[01:31:17] <Deeply> let me upload it
[01:31:20] <pigiman> ok
[01:31:53] <sikor_sxe> dodfr: the surrounding quotes are of course not in the code
[01:32:07] <sikor_sxe> and changing it to single quotes produces the same behaviour
[01:32:09] <sikor_sxe> :/
[01:32:44] <dodfr> sikor_sxe: ok I thought double quote was inside the original quote, so changing to single quote is useless
[01:33:27] <sikor_sxe> i noticed, btw. while it shows in the browser in firefox, in firebug the element is greyed out: "/html/body/div[2]/p (null)". what could that mean?
[01:33:36] <sikor_sxe> i guess that is why chrome isn't showing it
[01:34:08] <Deeply> pigiman
[01:34:10] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Debex/
[01:34:18] <Deeply> the alert box doesn't disappear at the end
[01:34:37] <Deeply> and I'm not sure I got everything converted to jquery
[01:34:52] <pigiman> ok let me a minute
[01:34:56] <pigiman> give *
[01:36:03] <dodfr> sikor : what do an alert($(xml).find("body").children()); show ?
[01:36:06] <sikor_sxe> is maybe "var test = $(xml).find('body').children();" producing a (single-sized, as there is only 1 child) list of elements?
[01:36:16] <pigiman> I think that demo1-jQuery.js is missing (probably all of your functions ?)
[01:36:32] <Deeply> i thought I added it
[01:36:34] <Deeply> one second
[01:37:03] <sikor_sxe> dodfr: it displays an "[object Object]" dialog
[01:37:12] <dodfr> so there is womething returned
[01:37:12] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Debex/1/
[01:37:34] <dodfr> sikor : what do an alert(JSON.stringify($(xml).find("body").children())); show ?
[01:38:22] <sikor_sxe> dodfr: "{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"context":{},"length":1},"context":{},"selector":"body","0":{}},"context":{},"selector":"body.children()"}"
[01:39:27] <pigiman> Deeply, are you sure you've uploaded your file ?
[01:39:31] <SpecialEmily> stringify.... nice method name
[01:39:40] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Debex/1/
[01:39:46] <Deeply> yes
[01:39:54] <dodfr> ok so your object contains "something" as an object, problem is that your whant to add an object inside an html
[01:40:26] <dodfr> you must convert it into strinified html or xml string beofre adding it
[01:40:36] <Deeply> wrong url :)
[01:40:37] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/Debex/3/
[01:40:39] <juha___> yo dawgs
[01:40:39] <Deeply> try that one
[01:40:49] <pigiman> ok 1 minute
[01:41:27] <sikor_sxe> dodfr: any hint to a function on how to create an html string out of an children() result?
[01:41:57] <dodfr> sikor : buy stringified I mean convert your object into string containing a real html/xml structure
[01:42:09] <dodfr> s/buy/by
[01:43:05] <sikor_sxe> yeah, i figured and i googled around a bit, but didn't find anything. so i guessed the transformation was happening implicitely
[01:45:35] <dodfr> sikor : look at saveHTML() function from DOMDocument() class
[01:46:15] <sikor_sxe> var xmlString = (new XMLSerializer()).serializeToString(xml); works for the unmodifien function argument
[01:46:54] <dodfr> XMLSerializer class may help too
[01:46:56] <sikor_sxe> but  "var xmlString = (new XMLSerializer()).serializeToString($(xml).find('body').children());" does not
[01:48:19] <dodfr> sikor : oups...need to go, but now you know why it don't work and what you need to do, just find a way how ...
[01:48:43] <sikor_sxe> thanks
[01:49:06] <sikor_sxe> hmm "alert($(xml).find('body').children().saveHTML());" does not work either
[01:51:52] <pigiman> Deeply, back-looking on it
[01:52:22] <Deeply> ok
[01:55:10] <cheater_> hey guys
[01:55:17] <cheater_> what's the difference between this and $(this) ?
[01:56:34] <sikor_sxe> what do i have to to use with a jquery xml object to use it in "(new XMLSerializer()).serializeToString()"?
[01:56:40] <L4suicide> how would I be able to do .closest() in older versions of jquery, eg. 1.2.6
[01:56:50] <sikor_sxe> or is there any other way to make an jquery xml node into a string?
[01:56:54] <gnarf> cheater_: depends on the situation, or more accurately - depends on "this"
[01:57:26] <gnarf> cheater_: in an event handler for instance - "this" is a DOMElement - and $(this) is a new jQuery containing only "this"
[01:57:49] <gnarf> cheater_: if "this" is already a jQuery element - calling $(this) is pointless, don't do it :)

[01:58:28] <bot-t> adamramadhan, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.

[02:02:32] <spir> Hi. How do you get an image height? $('img#myImg').height(); Is that correct?
[02:02:44] <Deeply> so the variables don't have to be changed to $variable then?
[02:02:47] <gnarf> spir: if the image is loaded, sure
[02:02:48] <Deeply> like $txt etc?
[02:03:11] <gnarf> Deeply: in fact, don't use $ on vars
[02:03:11] <spir> gnarf>Doesn't work on Chrome so I guess image wasn't loaded
[02:03:49] <Deeply> gnarf: so then the url that pigiman posted is converted to jquery then?
[02:03:51] <cheater_> gnarf: i'm trying to figure out how to modify a jquery element to make some internal information available on the outside.. basically it defines $.fn.whatever, and i do something like $('#div').whatever() to run it
[02:03:59] <gnarf> Deeply: although, by naming convention, I'll commonly use var $div = $("<div></div>"); for instance...
[02:04:00] <pigiman> Deeply, nope , you don't need $vars
[02:04:00] <adamramadhan> gnarf: can we format it ? like 2011-03-16 12:01:08 ?
[02:04:02] <cheater_> gnarf: i need to be able to access an internal variable
[02:04:27] <gnarf> Deeply: i.e., I only use $varName when the variable holds something jQuery

[02:04:57] <bot-t> gnarf: 111
[02:05:02] <gnarf> ?js (new Date()).getMonth()
[02:05:03] <bot-t> gnarf: 4
[02:05:07] <gnarf> etc
[02:05:10] <Deeply> ah so i guess that's why it wasn't working
[02:05:15] <spir> How do you get image height? $(document).ready(function(){ $('img#myImg').height();  });  Is that correct?
[02:05:18] <cheater_> i've identified the variable, and the setter for it, but i'm not sure how to make it available to other javascript functions that are unrelated
[02:05:18] <adamramadhan> wew. thats alot. ok let me try
[02:05:29] <Deeply> ok let me load my original js and make your changes here manually
[02:05:43] <cheater_> i would probably need to have an instance of whatever jquery instantiates when i do $('#div').reel()
[02:05:50] <gnarf> spir: if the image has loaded, sure....
[02:05:58] <gnarf> ?load event
[02:06:00] <bot-t> gnarf, .load() - Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[02:06:12] <cheater_> is there a standard solution in jquery to do this? as in keep track of instances of objects
[02:06:17] <pigiman> ok , if you want to use all jQuery methods, don't forget to use $.each(... { $(this)...
[02:06:49] <Deeply> well I'd like to get as much of it converted to jquery as possible
[02:07:14] <pigiman> of course, if you are loading jQuery you need to use its power
[02:07:48] <gnarf> ?widget factory @cheater_
[02:07:50] <bot-t> cheater_, UI/Developer Guide - ui.core.js provides a factory method to create widget classes. The signature is $.widget(String name, Options prototype). http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[02:07:54] <gnarf> hrm
[02:08:11] <cheater_> gnarf: i don't have a problem creating a widget
[02:08:13] <gnarf> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory @cheater_
[02:08:14] <srk9> I am trying to extract information from my university's course registration system via a bookmarklet. Searching requires several page loads. Is it possible to load the search page into a hidden iframe and then do the manipulations on that?
[02:08:32] <tarzeau> good morning
[02:08:36] <srk9> Good morning.
[02:08:40] <cheater_> gnarf: jquery reel is a fully functioning jquery plugin, i just need to be able to extract information from it
[02:08:43] <cheater_> no idea how to do it :X
[02:09:01] <tarzeau> i have got a problem with jquery+galleria, so that the the pictures only load after a refresh/reload of the page. can that easily be fixed?
[02:09:02] <gnarf> cheater_: store an instance of your plugin in .data() as shown in that slideshow I sent you
[02:09:17] <gnarf> cheater_: or use the jQuery UI widget factory and gain a bunch of free shit
[02:09:37] <tarzeau> the page in question, also doesn't display right on IE, www.kerstindittmar.ch - any help welcome
[02:10:08] <L4suicide> Anyone have any ideas why a script using jquery 1.6 works on jfiddle, but in greasemonkey things in .data() can't be used in other functions/parts of the script?
[02:10:17] <L4suicide> And have any work around for this
[02:10:17] <gnarf> cheater_: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide5 in particular
[02:10:29] <cheater_> thanks a lot, looking at it
[02:10:40] <cheater_> gnarf: but tbh i'm not sure what the "instance of the plugin" is
[02:10:52] <gnarf> cheater_: aka... use .data()
[02:11:29] <gnarf> cheater_: you have some "stateful data" right? store it on $(this).data()
[02:11:41] <gnarf> you need to have a setter getter?
[02:12:19] <gnarf> cheater_: there is a video of that talk that might help explain some of the concepts
[02:12:41] <gnarf> cheater_: http://vimeo.com/22686559
[02:13:00] <cheater_> ok, that makes sense what they're talking about in the slides
[02:13:03] <cheater_> what is this.each() for though?
[02:13:52] <LSshock> anyone know the best approach to making a html5 video player auto-playing playlist using a <lu> list?
[02:13:59] <gnarf> cheater_: remember, jQuery elements can contain MULTIPLE elements
[02:13:59] <cheater_> does it iterate over the variables defined in "this" and do something with them?
[02:14:19] <LSshock> i got the list and the code to have it play a new video, just need a good way of using the list items
[02:14:22] * cheater_ 's javascript is rusty, but i've known it for like 10 years now
[02:14:29] <gnarf> cheater_: $(".somethings").myPlugin() should start up a myPlugin() for each '.somethings'
[02:14:29] <cheater_> ok so each() is just a looping construct?
[02:14:34] <L4suicide> was setter/getter comment at me?
[02:14:36] <gnarf> ?$.each @cheater_
[02:14:38] <bot-t> cheater_, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:14:45] <cheater_> thanks
[02:15:23] <gnarf> cheater_: almost all plugins return this.each(function() { // do shit };
[02:15:23] <ThiefMaster|work> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7322 - please reopen, that commit did not fully fix it (see the last comment)
[02:18:34] <adamramadhan> hello i cant format the date , http://jsfiddle.net/jSWXH/1/ heres what im up to.
[02:19:21] <gnarf> ThiefMaster|work: #jqueryui-dev
[02:21:21] <jovrtn> adamramadhan: remove the extra parens from this line:  var dh = new Date().getHours()().toString();
[02:21:46] <adamramadhan> ah i see
[02:21:48] <jovrtn> also you don't need the <script> tag in jsfiddle
[02:21:54] <jovrtn> but you probably just pasted that from your actual page
[02:21:59] <adamramadhan> anyway cant we do something like alert("dy-dm-dd-dh-dm-ds"); instead?
[02:22:16] <adamramadhan> ++ signs does make it ugly.
[02:22:28] <dirkpennings> adamramadhan: http://jsfiddle.net/jSWXH/2/
[02:22:55] <jovrtn> not as far as I know
[02:23:03] <Deeply> pigiman:
[02:23:14] <Deeply> did you change the html form any?
[02:23:26] <adamramadhan> ?js (new Date()).getYear()
[02:23:28] <bot-t> adamramadhan: 111
[02:23:31] <adamramadhan> wew
[02:23:35] <adamramadhan> it should be 2011
[02:24:07] <jovrtn> ?js (new Date()).getFullYear()
[02:24:08] <bot-t> jovrtn: 2011
[02:24:09] <Deeply> but it's only been 111 years since the coming of the great white handkerchief
[02:24:10] <pigiman> I changed only on function
[02:24:22] <Deeply> ok
[02:24:27] <pigiman> you don't need to send this.form
[02:24:28] <Deeply> it's broke :)
[02:24:38] <pigiman> if you get your form with $("#FORM_ID")
[02:24:49] <adamramadhan> ah i see
[02:24:51] <pigiman>  clean your html from JS if you are using jQuery
[02:25:04] <diegoviola> how to trigger an ajax call when clicking a select tag and changing its options?
[02:25:07] <pigiman> $(document).ready(function(){ CLICK EVENTS });
[02:25:16] <pigiman> OR any other events
[02:25:30] <Deeply> did you see what my original code did?
[02:25:35] <spir> gnarf> Thanks you. Using load made the trick
[02:25:41] <pigiman> yeah
[02:25:57] <Deeply> if you type in id|pw@ it would pop up an alert
[02:26:04] <Deeply> i made your changes, and now it does not
[02:26:11] <Deeply> looking to see if I can figur it out
[02:26:27] <diegoviola> pigiman: thanks
[02:27:02] <pigiman> diegoviola, hehe it wasn't for you but I think you can use it
[02:27:23] <gnarf> ThiefMaster|work: reopened (finally saw the bug ;))
[02:27:25] <pigiman> you need http://api.jquery.com/change/ for select changes
[02:27:33] <Deeply> aha, it's not focusing on the barcode field when I reload the page
[02:27:42] <pigiman> Deeply, so just add
[02:27:45] <pigiman> inside your .ready
[02:27:54] <pigiman> $("BARCODE ID ").focus()
[02:28:08] <adamramadhan> ?js (new Date()).getSeconds()
[02:28:09] <bot-t> adamramadhan: 53
[02:28:19] <adamramadhan> ?js (new Date()).getSeconds()
[02:28:20] <bot-t> adamramadhan: 4
[02:28:24] <adamramadhan> aha!
[02:28:33] <adamramadhan> how can we make it 04?
[02:28:35] <gnarf> adamramadhan: you can use your debugger console too
[02:29:08] <adamramadhan> sory nice bot :| i wish i have one at my home.
[02:29:14] <Deeply> ok
[02:29:18] <pigiman> Deeply, I`m going to eat something, its working ?
[02:29:55] <gnarf> ?js var seconds = 4; console.log( seconds < 10 ? "0" + seconds : seconds );
[02:29:56] <bot-t> gnarf: "04"
[02:30:02] <gnarf> ?js var seconds = 10; console.log( seconds < 10 ? "0" + seconds : seconds );
[02:30:03] <bot-t> gnarf: 10

[02:30:30] <bot-t> adamramadhan, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[02:30:37] <Deeply> hmmm I see no ready
[02:30:40] <Deeply> looking that up
[02:31:01] <diegoviola> ok so, how can i trigger an ajax event when clicking on a select tag and changing its options please?
[02:31:04] <adamramadhan> okay.
[02:33:07] <diegoviola> anyone please?
[02:34:27] <Deeply> heh pigiman: nope
[02:37:22] <Aamir> ?change @diegoviola
[02:37:23] <bot-t> diegoviola, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[02:37:45] <cheater_> hmm
[02:38:21] <pigiman> Deeply, OK send a message if there is a problem (write my name I will see it) . bbl
[02:38:43] <diegoviola> Aamir: thanks
[02:38:50] <Aamir> np
[02:38:53] <Deeply> thank you
[02:39:04] <Deeply> not working. but I'm trying to fix it
[02:40:45] <The_Fly> anybody here making use of a javascript templating engine?
[02:40:59] <The_Fly> ive been searching for a few and am yet to settle on one for a project
[02:42:03] <The_Fly> most seem to return flat html or insert the generated DOMElement hierarchy into a container
[02:42:54] <Aamir> ?template @The_Fly
[02:42:55] <bot-t> The_Fly, Templates - These documentation topics concern the jQuery Templates plugin (jquery-tmpl), which can be downloaded from: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl . http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[02:43:00] <The_Fly> and id like to save certain domelements as the template is being generated
[02:43:14] <cheater_> gnarf: do the plugins return this.each(function() {   }) in order to implement a fluent interface etc?
[02:43:18] <Aamir> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.template/ ?
[02:43:26] <cheater_> gnarf: why do they need to return it? what is this function for?
[02:43:29] <gnarf> cheater_: chainable
[02:43:33] <cheater_> yeah
[02:43:35] <cheater_> that's what i meant
[02:43:48] <gnarf> $el.myPlugin().addClass("boo")
[02:43:50] <Aamir> cheater_:  for chaining purpose
[02:43:52] <cheater_> thanks
[02:43:57] <cheater_> that's what i meant by fluent
[02:44:16] <Deeply> pigiman: i reverted to the original file, making your changes one at a time
[02:44:31] <cheater_> i guess chainable is a better word for it :)
[02:46:08] <The_Fly> Aamir: thanks, im still not quite sure that it does what i want
[02:47:15] <The_Fly> for example, a template which generates a navigation heirarchy but also returns a nested JSON object with the DOMElements which were created during processing
[02:47:33] <The_Fly> im wanting to avoid selecting elements after processing a template
[02:48:24] <The_Fly> because in my case I'm generating a rather dense DOM and want to avoid innefficiencies
[02:48:44] <Deeply> pigiman: i found what was causing the alert box to stay up
[02:49:11] <Deeply> document.getElementById('submitbutton').click(); i had changed it to $('#submitbutton').click();
[02:57:19] <Deeply> had to revert again
[02:57:30] <Deeply> seems if I change things, the damned thing stops working
[02:59:37] <DRagonRage> hi $(this).prop('checked') returns true when unselected is this normal?
[03:00:32] <DRagonRage> hi guy's?
[03:00:42] <DRagonRage> jquery 1.6 here...
[03:01:28] <DRagonRage> ?
[03:02:01] <ablomen> DRagonRage, "According to the W3C forms specification, the checked attribute is a boolean attribute, which means the corresponding property is true if the attribute is present at all"
[03:02:28] <DRagonRage> Oo
[03:02:31] <ablomen> so you either need is(":checked") or attr("checked")
[03:02:37] <DRagonRage> but when it is unchecked it is true....
[03:02:57] <DRagonRage> and when it is checked it is false...
[03:03:23] <pigiman> Deeply, ok it works ?
[03:03:39] <ablomen> og and "The code if ( $(elem).attr("checked") ), on the other hand, will retrieve the attribute, which does not change as the checkbox is checked and unchecked. It is meant only to store the default or initial value of the checked property."
[03:03:43] <DRagonRage> oh wait does it check before or after the click event?
[03:03:44] <ablomen> *oh
[03:03:51] <ablomen> so you want is(":checked")
[03:04:35] <DRagonRage> ok but does it check (makes it true) before or after the event click and can i be sure across browsers....
[03:06:28] <ablomen> it should be fine, its fired after you release the mouse button
[03:07:23] <DRagonRage> ok
[03:07:26] <DRagonRage> say i have
[03:07:48] <DRagonRage> .click(function () { console.log($(this).is(':checked'));})
[03:07:57] <DRagonRage> what fires first?
[03:08:09] <seutje> first? out of 1 thing?
[03:08:19] <DRagonRage> click / prop('checked', 'checked') ?
[03:08:35] <ablomen> ..
[03:08:39] <DRagonRage> the browser checks the checkbox  or the click event....
[03:08:48] <seutje> u lost me
[03:08:54] <DRagonRage> uh
[03:08:57] <DRagonRage> ok
[03:08:59] <DRagonRage> iil try again
[03:09:07] <DRagonRage> once i click a checkbox
[03:09:13] <DRagonRage> things happen
[03:09:17] <DRagonRage> one of them
[03:09:29] <DRagonRage> is the actual browser changes the checked prop
[03:09:31] <seutje> u should
[03:09:32] <seutje> put less
[03:09:34] <seutje> words
[03:09:37] <seutje> on
[03:09:38] <DRagonRage> and one of them is the click event
[03:09:39] <seutje> each
[03:09:40] <coldhead> does anyone want to talk about altjs.org?
[03:09:41] <seutje> line
[03:09:44] <DRagonRage> which comes first....
[03:10:07] <DRagonRage> seutje, huh ?
[03:10:07] <coldhead> seutje: fewer*
[03:10:14] <DRagonRage> why
[03:10:14] <seutje> coldhead: sorry :(
[03:10:16] <coldhead> XD
[03:10:31] <DRagonRage> common guys cut me some slack
[03:10:43] <DRagonRage> did you get the point
[03:10:45] <coldhead> how much do you want? i have two whole days
[03:10:46] <seutje> DRagonRage: it'll return true when checking it, false when unchecking it
[03:10:46] <DRagonRage> ?
[03:10:48] <Deeply> I think I'm going to be talking to my client this morning and telling him it can't be done in jquery
[03:10:58] <seutje> but it's funky
[03:11:04] <coldhead> maybe try flash Deeply ?
[03:11:18] <Deeply> coldhead: it works in javascript
[03:11:25] <coldhead> flash is good if you need stuff In A Flash
[03:11:29] <coldhead> it's great for deadlines
[03:11:30] <DRagonRage> <seutje> ok how about toggle
[03:11:45] <seutje> $(':checkbox').bind('click', function() { console.log($(this).is(':checked')); return false; }); will always return true, but will never leave the checkbox checked
[03:12:04] <seutje> unless it was checked onload ofc
[03:12:16] <DRagonRage> omg this is bad...
[03:12:18] <seutje> DRagonRage: how about u tell me what ur trying to do?
[03:12:28] <seutje> while I go have a smoke
[03:12:34] <DRagonRage> a grid with selection
[03:12:39] <coldhead> hapy smoak seutje !
[03:12:39] <DRagonRage> lol
[03:12:51] <DRagonRage> ye i will also
[03:12:56] <coldhead> ME TOO
[03:13:02] <coldhead> LET'S ALL GET BAKED
[03:13:14] <Deeply> I only smoke when I set myself on fire.
[03:13:51] <ablomen> DRagonRage, http://jsfiddle.net/YRwhs/
[03:14:53] <dakota> Good day. Is this the best/most efficient way to acheive this result: http://jsfiddle.net/GQkXQ/
[03:17:22] <coldhead> dakota: http://jsfiddle.net/GQkXQ/2/
[03:18:47] <coldhead> you could probably optimise the selector itself but i am too baked for that right now
[03:18:49] <LSshock> Could someone please help me out figuring out how to turn this list into an array i can use the title and url from http://jsfiddle.net/ft57c/
[03:19:12] <ablomen> dakota, the fastest thing would be to just give them a different class
[03:19:16] <Trudko> Guys I need to run tihs script to run faster, I have table and inside it are many inputs which values I need to reset http://pastebin.com/kiQKMDA3
[03:19:24] <dakota> coldhead: The main thing I'm looking at is the selector. the .css() is just there to show the result.
[03:19:36] <dakota> ablomen:  probably, will look at possibly doing that rather
[03:21:53] <ablomen> Trudko, use native functions in the each loop
[03:22:07] <ablomen> and at least cache $(this);
[03:22:41] <Trudko> ablomen what do you mean by native functions?
[03:22:58] <cheater_> gnarf: thanks for your help! i have figured it out!
[03:23:05] <Deeply> 3 in the morning and my boss will be here in less than 2 hours :)
[03:23:06] <ablomen> Trudko, non-jquery functions, so if (this.checked)  etc
[03:23:11] <Deeply> :)
[03:23:20] <Deeply> he'll probably fire my fat ass
[03:23:26] <coldhead> LSshock: http://jsfiddle.net/ft57c/1/
[03:23:26] <pigiman> Deeply, you still need help ?
[03:23:42] <Deeply> i had to revert back to my original file
[03:23:49] <pigiman> why?
[03:23:58] <Deeply> i honestly don't think what I'm doing can be done in jquery
[03:24:13] <Trudko> ablomen why not write all of that in native code?
[03:24:17] <pigiman> I will help you
[03:24:27] <pigiman> where is my latest changes?
[03:24:38] <pigiman> I think I closed it :O
[03:24:39] <ablomen> Trudko, well you can, but that would not give you a huge speed difference
[03:24:48] <ablomen> Trudko, only stuff that is repeated many times
[03:25:32] <Deeply> http://jsfiddle.net/Nvutn/2/
[03:25:35] <Deeply> is that it?
[03:25:42] <pigiman> yea
[03:25:42] <pigiman> h
[03:25:44] <LSshock> coldhead: thanks a lot, but seems to return [object object] couple times?
[03:25:44] <pigiman> give me few minutes
[03:26:21] <coldhead> LSshock: moofies[0].title and moofies[2].url etc
[03:26:31] <coldhead> the object has the properties you wanted
[03:26:44] <LSshock> oh i see now, my bad
[03:26:49] <LSshock> got it
[03:26:54] <LSshock> thanks coldhead !
[03:27:52] <Trudko> ablomne and how to do that?  sorry for lame question I am newbie into js with object to check if it has property it is this['property'] right? but with element.. ?
[03:30:29] <coldhead> Trudko: don't worry about the native functions until you need to, they're tricky. cacheing $(this) is the quickest optimisation
[03:31:02] <coldhead> var $this = $(this) and then replace all your $(this)s with $this
[03:31:09] <coldhead> save you calling $() over and over

[03:36:35] <coldhead> read the code, moofies is an array and each of its entries is an {} object

[03:45:16] <dr0id> ok ?
[03:45:27] <Trudko> thats what I was planning :)
[03:45:36] <dr0id> next day
[03:45:42] <muzone> Can somebody suggest a script?
[03:45:44] <Trudko> something like that
[03:45:51] <Trudko> coldhead so any tips?
[03:47:17] <ablomen> Trudko, you are still not caching $(this)
[03:48:03] <coldhead> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/1/
[03:48:10] <coldhead> did you try something like that?
[03:48:23] <coldhead> where you actually reuse $this?
[03:48:31] <coldhead> because that should defo be faster
[03:48:57] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?01E - how do I make "Categories" and "Designers" expandable? So that they are contracted by default, and one has to click on them to expand and see its links?
[03:49:03] <Trudko> sorry abolomen coldhead I used this http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/2/
[03:49:05] <muzone> Can somebody recommend a script for this?
[03:49:12] <coldhead> also Trudko it looks like you are just trying to reset a form?
[03:49:17] <coldhead> isn't there some kind of reset?
[03:49:23] <coldhead> ?mdc reset
[03:49:25] <bot-t> coldhead, form.reset - MDC Docs - reset resets the form to its initial state. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/form.reset
[03:49:26] <Trudko> coldhead part of form
[03:49:31] <coldhead> oh okay
[03:50:02] <ablomen> Trudko, $this.value = "" does not work btw
[03:50:08] <Trudko> I have huge form separated into several sections as you can see and I need to hide them and reset them. Reset because otherwise the values will be sent on server side
[03:50:14] <ablomen> remove the $
[03:50:54] <Trudko> ablomen where exactly?
[03:51:03] <Trudko> and I should suse val shouldnt I?
[03:51:18] <ablomen> no, no need, this.value works fine, and is faster
[03:51:57] <coldhead> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/2/
[03:52:18] <coldhead> sorry, that is the previous version
[03:52:26] <coldhead> jsfiddle is slow as shit
[03:52:31] <coldhead> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/3/
[03:52:35] <coldhead> see if that is faster?
[03:53:25] <Trudko> coldhead why did you add comments around first section?
[03:53:39] <coldhead> to show you the code my code is replacing
[03:54:10] <coldhead> can you put the html on jsfiddle too so we can actually test it?
[03:54:42] <Trudko> coldhead ...uf ok
[03:54:58] <coldhead> only if it's no trouble!
[03:56:19] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?01E - how do I make "Categories" and "Designers" expandable? So that they are contracted by default, and one has to click on them to expand and see its links?
[03:56:24] <muzone> Can somebody recommend a script for this?
[03:56:25] * muzone will keep trying
[03:56:27] <ablomen> Trudko, https://gist.github.com/968317 << this should be fastest, you should test it in ie etc but it should work
[03:56:36] <hello44> hi.. is there a way to fake hoverIntent? one of my functions is triggered by it.. but i'd like to call it via script
[03:56:53] <hello44> ie. instead of the user actually mousing over...
[03:59:12] <coldhead> check the source, hello44
[03:59:26] <coldhead> it might let you trigger() a custom event
[03:59:44] <coldhead> and if it doesn't, you could probably add it pretty easy
[04:02:20] <hello44> coldhead: thanks.. had a search. no luck. i think it's beyond me @ this stage!
[04:02:20] <crashev> anyone knows if sortable plugin (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable) can somehow handle tables or do I have to use another plugin for sorting tables?
[04:02:26] <hello44> i'll try for a work around
[04:02:52] <hello44> what im trying to do is.. i have 6 divs on a page.. and i want to run effects on each of those sequentially
[04:03:05] <hello44> namely. jquery.cycle
[04:04:17] <coldhead> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/4/
[04:04:29] <coldhead> doubt that works but it's much shorter <3
[04:04:58] <coldhead> hello44: you wanna maybe try to write it up in pseudcode?
[04:05:09] <coldhead> pseudo*
[04:05:21] <coldhead> how you think it should work?
[04:05:37] <Trudko> coldhead I tried it it was shorther so great that but not much faster and ablomen you forgot something like var $this = $(this); didnot u because my code will fail(ie7) on 		if (this.hasAttribute('checked')) {
[04:06:15] <hello44> coldhead: i've been searching / trying things for days. this is the most promising... http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-easy-sequential-animations-in-jquery/
[04:06:16] <ablomen> ok then ie7 does not follow that standard, what a suprise
[04:06:43] <hello44> i've got it going.. but not for the jquery cycle part of it
[04:06:58] <coldhead> show us what you got?
[04:07:41] <hello44> 2mins.. ill try and undo my last changes :P
[04:07:58] <coldhead> Trudko: might it be faster to duplicate the form in the HTML and clone it?
[04:08:09] <coldhead> it sounds like a pretty big form
[04:09:03] <Trudko> coldhead its is above avarage  , strill trying to get all the code so we can test it
[04:09:19] <ablomen> Trudko, you could try replacing hasAttribute with getAttribute btw
[04:10:47] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?01E - how do I make "Categories" and "Designers" expandable? So that they are contracted by default, and one has to click on them to expand and see its links?
[04:10:58] <muzone> Can somebody recommend a script for this?
[04:11:10] <hello44> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/1wrU9ghJ
[04:11:40] <hello44> part of interest is line 50... that indeed fades out the divs 1 at a time.. i only got that going this afternoon
[04:12:14] <ablomen> muzone, google for jquery accordion
[04:12:28] <ablomen> or just use the jquery ui one
[04:13:02] <coldhead> sorry hello44 this is beyond me but hang on to the paste and someone should be able to help
[04:13:13] <coldhead> bonus marks for getting a working demo up on jsfiddle
[04:13:40] <hello44> coldhead: all good. i reckon i will resolve this myself within the next week and learn a heap in the process
[04:13:50] <hello44> and ill be on the jsfiddle bandwagon too =)
[04:14:20] <coldhead> i wanna see what you come up with if it's any good
[04:15:00] <coldhead> i've had too much xanax to help now :|
[04:15:38] <hello44> haha. i just took extra strength cold n flu.. gotta be good for a meeting tomorrow :(
[04:16:01] <hello44> not related to this thankfully
[04:16:14] <muzone> ablomen: thanks a lot man =)
[04:16:21] <muzone> ablomen: wait, jquery ui one? which one is that?
[04:16:29] <Trudko> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/5/ this is one part(the biggest one)
[04:16:42] <Trudko> there is still some js inside html i ope that does not matter
[04:16:55] <muzone> MAN !! awesome script ablomen :))
[04:17:12] <Trudko> but w8 i think there is vesrion of script which edoest work
[04:17:49] <iamtony> Hey - does anyone know about jstree on here? I have a function bound to the 'open_node.jstree' event, but  how do I get the ID of the node that's been opened?
[04:20:23] <Trudko> coldhead ablomen this wwas is right http://jsfiddle.net/rBUb6/6/ on jsfilddle it seems to find but on my pc its pretty slow , for like sec. it freezes before it shows time
[04:21:14] <ablomen> Trudko, that example is slow for you, in jsfiddle?
[04:21:28] <Trudko> thats not slow but in application it self
[04:21:38] <Trudko> it is
[04:22:17] <Trudko> I hide that section and then reset it hiding is fast but reseting is the slow part
[04:22:39] <Trudko> as you can see the whole code has something like 2000 lines(with some javascript in it)
[04:23:33] <ablomen> Trudko, but it's exactly the same source locally? this form is not shorter?
[04:23:57] <Trudko> ablomne i only pasted the biggest the slowest form
[04:24:06] <Trudko> its not whole code
[04:24:16] <ablomen> well then your problem is somewhere else... this only takes 3 ms for me
[04:24:20] <Trudko> but i can past that oo
[04:24:32] <iamtony> Ha found it in data.args[0], not data.inst - confusing :-)
[04:25:09] <ablomen> and again, $this.value = ""; does not work
[04:25:32] <Trudko> actualy no i cant past the whole thing jsfiddle seems to have problem with that
[04:25:56] <ablomen> either do this.value = ""; or $this.val(""); .value is an attribute of the dom element, .val() is a jquery function
[04:31:38] <jkies00> hi all,
[04:32:14] <jkies00> i've recently inherited some jquery code, and they call all of their methods using call, like this:  $('.button-login').click(function(event){ handleClickLoginButton.call(this,event); });
[04:32:16] <jkies00> $('.button-login').click(function(event){ handleClickLoginButton.call(this,event); });
[04:32:18] <eml> http://jsfiddle.net/PBYys/5/ why is neither addClass nor removeClass "happening" during draggable stop & start events?
[04:32:36] <jkies00> is this a good practice to call methods?
[04:34:40] <Trudko> ablomen yeap true isnt the traversing part slow? $("#accountProfile").find("select,input,textarea").each( function() {
[04:35:49] <seutje> Trudko: u can always do some a/b testing on jsperf.com
[04:36:33] <Trudko> seutje I can do testing on my own pc
[04:36:42] <sac> eml, they are happening
[04:36:44] <jovrtn> jkies00: #draggable is a more specific selector than .beingdragged
[04:36:46] <coldhead> you can always do it in flash from adobe.com
[04:36:49] <sac> eml, you have beingdragged and beendragged
[04:36:59] <jovrtn> o wrong person
[04:37:15] <jovrtn> the background declaration on #draggable is overriding .beingdragged
[04:37:17] <Trudko> seutje ou sorry i thought u are talking about something else
[04:37:24] <jovrtn> change it to #draggable.beingdragged
[04:37:26] <sac> but yeah that too what jovrtn said
[04:37:41] <Trudko> and how would I write that whole thing in Javascript?
[04:38:49] <sac> eml, http://jsfiddle.net/PBYys/6/
[04:38:55] <marktuk> what is the best way to use a variable in the options for a function?
[04:39:04] <Deeply> ? download jquery
[04:39:05] <bot-t> Deeply, Downloading jQuery - The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document. If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it on the Development mailing list... http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[04:39:22] <ablomen> Trudko, take your code appart and see what the slow part is, it is fast in jsfiddle so i'm almost sure your problem lies somewhere else
[04:39:42] <eml> sac: Oh.. Thanks!
[04:42:25] <Trudko> ablomen slow part is $("#partyDetailsSectionId").find("select,input,textarea").each( function() because if i delete that it is fast enoug
[04:46:16] <marktuk> i need to do something like $('a.link').modalbox({ href: $(this).attr('href')+" #element" })
[04:46:23] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E - I am trying to do an expand/contract thing with my menu using http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion - but what am I doing wrong?
[04:46:28] <marktuk> i think that's wrong though :S
[04:47:03] <Trudko> ablomen thats why I hink I should wwrite traversing of dom in pure JS
[04:50:15] <marktuk> anyone? correct way to do this $('a.link').modalbox({ href: $(this).attr('href')+" #element" })
[04:51:40] <gnarf> Trudko: you have other issues in your each
[04:51:50] <gnarf> Trudko: .value = "" should be .value( "" )
[04:51:53] <gnarf> er sry
[04:51:57] <gnarf> .val( "" )
[04:52:06] <jovrtn> marktuk: what's the console say?
[04:52:28] <gnarf> Trudko: also, in jQuery 1.6+ - you shouldn't be using attr('checked')
[04:52:32] <marktuk> missing : after property id
[04:53:12] <gnarf> Trudko: if (this.checked) { $this.prop( "checked", false ) }
[04:53:26] <gnarf> or even
[04:53:29] <muzone> ablomen: May I bribe some of your time for http://www.zshare.net/download/552763591f4802ce/ ?:)
[04:53:36] <gnarf> if ( this.checked ) { this.checked = false; }
[04:53:43] <muzone> youre gonna love it i promise
[04:53:45] <gnarf> works in all versions of jQuery
[04:54:23] <gnarf> Trudko: but as far as speed goes, that fiddle reports to execute in 1ms
[04:55:24] <marktuk> jovrtn: the problem isn't using $(this).attr('href') to specify an functions option, i can wrap it in an anonymous function and it works, it's just i need to append " #element" to the result
[04:55:52] <marktuk> i know this is wrong     href: function(){$(this).attr('href')}+' div#resourceForm',
[04:56:46] <philip_> hi, when using chrome having the debugger open, it always breaks at two points... is this some known issue?
[04:58:29] <gnarf> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rBUb6/8/ -- updated with those fixes
[04:59:16] <Gruni> Hey hey guys. :)
[04:59:26] <philip_> hey hey ;)
[04:59:58] <Gruni> Quick question, couldn't find the right answer on google (and I'm not that into jquery selectors...)
[05:00:19] <jovrtn> marktuk: $('a.link').modalbox({ href: $(this).attr('href')+"irc://irc.freenode.net/#element" }); doesn't work?
[05:00:30] <jovrtn> er
[05:00:33] <jovrtn> whatever the hell I just pasted
[05:00:47] <djQuery> gnarf: wouldn't be easier to just call reset on the form?
[05:00:54] <jovrtn> $('a.link').modalbox({ href: $(this).attr('href')+"#element" });
[05:00:56] <gnarf> djQuery: prolly
[05:01:06] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E - I am trying to do an expand/contract thing with my menu using http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion - but what am I doing wrong?
[05:01:06] <Trudko> gnarf seems better but still slow I mean its like 0.3s on IE7 but I have to run on IE6 which I dont have so I cant test it
[05:01:25] <gnarf> Trudko: see djQuery's suggestion
[05:01:59] <Gruni> How can I access dynamically other <a>-Attributes (like href) from within tipsy()? -> $('a[rel*=ficuser]').tipsy({ })
[05:02:16] <gnarf> Gruni: you don't
[05:02:49] <Gruni> Hmmm. Too bad, gnarf. :/
[05:02:54] <gnarf> Gruni: $('a[rel*=ficuser]').each(function() { $(this).tispy({ prop: a.href }); });
[05:03:00] <gnarf> Gruni: in that form you can ;)
[05:03:00] <Starchaser> hi. is there way to get know if {{each}}{{/each}} iteration the last in jquery-template ?
[05:03:01] <djQuery> gnarf: Trudko  well maybe if there was a form on the page.
[05:03:06] <Trudko> djQuery not I cant call reset form because I am resting part of form
[05:03:18] <Trudko> resting just part of form
[05:03:45] <Trudko> basicly depeneding on value of one dropdown I need to show or hide part of form and when I hide it I need to reset values of all input fields in it
[05:03:49] <Trudko> in that  part of form
[05:03:56] <djQuery> ?:input
[05:03:56] <bot-t> :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[05:08:53] <staffang> Hi, I'm trying to call a java servlet when using a Jquery Ui Tab by eg. setting: <li><a href="servlet?id=1">tab1</a></li> but it is not being called... I would then also like to just have the tabs, not the underlying div which contain the pages, I want the tabs to be used as a menu which is implemented on each page and then when clicking a tab redirect to another page.
[05:09:29] <staffang> the reason for not building the tabs my self is that we also need paging on the tabs since there needs to be no limit on the number of tabs availabe...
[05:10:16] <staffang> and the paging plugin for jquery ui tabs is nice. :)
[05:10:28] <Gruni> gnarf, thank you. $(this).prop did the trick <3
[05:11:37] <jovrtn> marktuk: try this: var link = $('a.link'); link.modalbox({ href: link.attr('href') + '#element' });
[05:22:41] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[05:22:50] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E - I am trying to do an expand/contract thing with my menu using http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion - but what am I doing wrong?
[05:23:25] <marktuk> jovrtn: that did the trick
[05:23:28] <marktuk> many thanks :)
[05:23:31] <jovrtn> np
[05:23:42] <muzone> marktuk: thank him by helping me out
[05:23:45] <muzone> hehe
[05:23:55] <muzone> come on y'all its a simple problem - and ill pay whoever helps
[05:26:23] <CPNL011> Can someone explain me why i get this problem. When i move the items from the left to the right box everything is ok. but when i try to sort the items on the right they duplicate. this is my link: http://jsfiddle.net/e42cU/1/
[05:26:49] <jovrtn> muzone: call accordion() on #side_menu instead of .header
[05:26:52] <jovrtn> works fine
[05:30:27] <muzone> jovrtn: really? cool man
[05:31:49] <muzone> jovrtn: here - http://www.zshare.net/download/552763591f4802ce/
[05:33:12] <dravekx> is there something like this in jQuery? http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex6/clock3.htm
[05:33:41] <dravekx> I just want to display live time and date on a toolbar
[05:35:24] <jovrtn> CPNL011: not sure what you're trying to accomplish exactly, but it seems like a lot of this behaviour could be achieved with the built-in draggable/droppable/sortable callbacks
[05:35:36] <jovrtn> rather than manually appending items
[05:36:29] <jovrtn> #rss-list and #right-content-container could be connected sortable lists, for example
[05:36:36] <jovrtn> to freely drag items between them
[05:38:25] <CPNL011> What i try to accomplish is to move video 1, video 2, video 3 (for example) to the right box and then in the right box sort the list
[05:40:23] <CPNL011> but when i sort them now in the right box it duplicates the items, very strange
[05:41:33] <jovrtn> CPNL011: using only sortable connected lists: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/e42cU/2/
[05:42:07] <CPNL011> Jovrtn: wow!!
[05:42:14] <jovrtn> you can use the sortable callbacks to animate the fading
[05:42:51] <jovrtn> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[05:42:54] <jovrtn> all you need really
[05:43:02] <lucasw> Hi, have anyone used uniformjs here?
[05:43:24] <CPNL011> jovrtn: thank you very much for your help.
[05:43:28] <jovrtn> sure thing
[05:44:00] <muzone> jovrtn: nice no?
[05:44:25] <muzone> CPNL011: give jovrtn something that means a lot to you
[05:44:42] <jovrtn> oh I missed the link, what is it?
[05:45:39] <muzone> jovrtn: its a mixtape http://www.zshare.net/download/552763591f4802ce/
[05:45:44] <muzone> the author passed away in 2006 though
[05:45:54] <jovrtn> ahh i'll check it out
[05:47:09] <SPYGAME> hey, im using jQuery("#contact_first_name").trigger("focus") in my page, it works for FF but not for IE 8, what's wrong, please suggest
[05:48:42] <Cork> SPYGAME: just use .focus()
[05:48:46] <Cork> that should work just fine
[05:51:05] <dravekx> anyone have a simple jQuery script that does date and time?
[05:52:31] <Cork> dravekx: "does date and time"?
[05:52:38] <Cork> do what with it?
[05:53:05] <Cork> display a dialog/picker, parse it, modify it, change timezone
[05:53:07] <Cork> or what?
[05:53:14] <dravekx> Cork, Something simple that does date and time.
[05:53:27] <dravekx> i dont want a "picker".. just a simple text display
[05:53:54] <Cork> ?eval Date.toString()
[05:53:54] <bot-t> Cork: "function Date() {\n    [native code]\n}"
[05:54:45] <dravekx> I found jClock, and it has the date options, but not sure how to make them display.
[05:55:10] <shwetank> click function not working properly with link class
[05:55:17] <Cork> dravekx: until you state what you want to do with the date time, its imposible to answer
[05:55:36] <Cork> dravekx: you can do simple date time displaying with (new Date).toString()
[05:55:38] <staffang> Is it possible to only use the tab-menu section of jquery ui tabs?
[05:55:41] <Cork> but i don't think thats what you want
[05:56:11] <ablomen> DragoneneWork, (function ( ) { $(".someClass").text((new Date()).toString()); setTimeout(arguments.callee, 1000); }()); << this is about as simple as it gets
[05:56:19] <ablomen> woops
[05:56:30] <ablomen> dravekx ^ that was for you
[05:56:49] <dravekx> ah
[05:57:21] <dravekx> yeah. I want a simple text display like: Thursday, May 12, 2011 7:57:06 AM
[05:57:46] <dravekx> no fancy graphics
[05:58:00] <shwetank> I've been trying to trigger the click event on a class but that is not working properly. Calling the function from firebug works perfectly
[05:59:10] <Cork> dravekx: you most likly want to format the default date output so http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format
[05:59:18] <Cork> the rest is farly simple
[05:59:28] <dravekx> Cork, ah cool. thanks!
[05:59:46] <muzone> At my expandable jQuery side menu at http://www.webdevout.net/test?0F - how do I apply the .expanded and .contracted classes to "Test 1" and "Test 2"?
[06:01:07] <kryl> what's wrong in this json format please : {"0x00":[{"Mode":{"0x19","0x18","0x13","0x1B"}}]} ?
[06:01:15] <metap0d> Hi everyone, I am trying to grab the value of a <select> drop down with jQuery and I don't know why my simple function isn't working ... any ideas? http://pastebin.com/L8WkvCkm
[06:01:27] <jovrtn> muzone: accordion already applies classes for those states
[06:01:38] <jovrtn> .ui-accordion-content-active when it's expanded
[06:01:58] <kryl> I want to have some data like : {"0x00":["Mode",{"0x19","0x18","0x13","0x1B"}]} (won't work too)
[06:01:58] <muzone> lemme try that jovrtn
[06:02:00] <muzone> and thanks
[06:02:58] <muzone> jovrtn: i havent tried it yet - but the problem was that the a's already had a black background set to them and setting those arrow backgrounds would cancel out the black
[06:03:13] <jovrtn> ohh
[06:03:14] <jovrtn> the anchors
[06:03:15] <jovrtn> sec
[06:03:36] <jovrtn> try
[06:03:43] <jovrtn> .ui-state-default and .ui-state-active
[06:03:48] <jovrtn> on the anchors
[06:04:07] <jovrtn> rather than .contracted and .expanded
[06:04:35] <muzone> will do 2 sec
[06:05:10] <jovrtn> metap0d: extra semicolon you have there
[06:05:51] <muzone> jovrtn: nope didnt seem to work http://www.webdevout.net/test?0G
[06:09:19] <srk9> I am trying to count the number of rows in a table with jquery. I can select the containing table via an id. The table contains nested tables, so if I select based on tr, I would likely be counting the nested rows as well, which I don't want. Is there any way to just count the immediate rows?
[06:09:29] <metap0d> jovrtn: I'm sorry that was added after the fact, it wasn't actually in my code. I still can't seem to output a value ... I tried 2 different ways as documented by jQuery .. no success :( http://pastebin.com/KX6iphM9
[06:10:41] <Anitox> $('#my_table_id > tr').length
[06:11:01] <playr1983> varÂ valueÂ =Â $("#printers").val();
[06:11:12] <playr1983> try varÂ valueÂ =Â $(this).val(); ?
[06:11:38] <jovrtn> muzone: I see the arrows: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/Sj9YC/
[06:11:46] <jovrtn> only on hover though, not sure if I pasted your css correctly
[06:12:39] <ablomen> srk9, $('#my_table_id > tbody > tr').length, some (if not all?) browsers add a tbody by default
[06:12:49] <muzone> jovrtn: i dont see nothing im afraid
[06:12:55] <playr1983> OR varÂ valueÂ =Â $("#printers")[0].val();  <<
[06:13:02] <srk9> ablomen: Thanks.
[06:13:43] <Anitox> np
[06:13:50] <ablomen> so make sure you define it btw, if it's not all browsers you will run in to trouble, or if there are no sub-tables just do $("#tableID tr") without the >
[06:14:00] <jovrtn> metap0d: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/nqQgR/
[06:14:03] <jovrtn> works for me
[06:15:05] <_foobar> Maybe a stupid question but I'm not afraid to ask :)
[06:15:05] <_foobar> is there a jQuery way to do the following? http://pastebin.com/2JGcMp7K
[06:15:05] <_foobar> It simply loads the trunk object with load/junk object or rights over the trunkobject if they both have the same attributes
[06:15:17] <_foobar> attributes ??
[06:15:22] <_foobar> I dont know
[06:15:32] <_foobar> but u probleblu understand
[06:17:01] <_foobar> Why I ask is for a plugin I'm working on.. We usuly let the user send options to the plugin so..
[06:17:43] <metap0d> playr1983,jovrtn: I tried all of your options and some of my own but unfortunately nothing wants to work. The option you had working for you won't even fire my alerts anymore
[06:19:45] <rachelw_> Any chance someone could help me with (I think) a basic jquery question?
[06:20:12] <ablomen> rachelw_, if you ask a question, there is a chance, yes :)
[06:20:19] <rachelw_> I've got a loop using .each(); and I want somehow to pass in some data to the callback. is this possible?
[06:21:09] <rachelw_> a longer explanation of what I'm trying to do...
[06:21:16] <playr1983> metapod: http://jsfiddle.net/nqQgR/3/  << this works for me (google chrome at least)
[06:21:27] <muzone> At my expandable jQuery side menu at http://www.webdevout.net/test?0F - how do I get those arrows inside my a.headers? http://www.webdevout.net/test?0G
[06:21:44] <_foobar> rachelw_: u can use the same variables in the same scope
[06:22:27] <rachelw_> _foobar, I'm using Firebug. It looks like my $data variable disappears inside the .each()
[06:22:36] <rachelw_> do I need to do something magic to get at it?
[06:22:50] <_foobar> please use pastebin
[06:22:55] <_foobar> @ rachelw_
[06:23:03] <rachelw_> sure...
[06:24:22] <Aamir> ?p
[06:24:23] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[06:24:57] <jovrtn> rachelw_: something like: var $test = 'test'; $('li').each(function() { $(this).text($test); }); ?
[06:25:04] <jovrtn> rachelw_: that works fine for me
[06:25:06] <srk9> Does anyone know why I am getting "SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" from chromium when I do $('table#ACE_$ICField104$1").length
[06:25:09] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/RpXsN/10/<-- anyone got idea how to fix this if i click on the ui button and select something it should resize now it resizes only when i click again
[06:25:10] <rachelw_> http://pastie.org/1893021
[06:25:49] <rachelw_> ah! does the $ at the start of the variable do something magic... (I'm a javascript newbie, in case you can't tell...)
[06:26:04] * rachelw_ scurries to get book...
[06:26:09] <Trisox> $ stands for jQuery
[06:26:22] <rachelw_> at the start of $test, I mean
[06:26:48] <jovrtn> oh, no
[06:26:48] <Aamir> ?valid id
[06:26:49] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[06:26:58] <Aamir> ^ srk9
[06:27:14] <jovrtn> I misused it there, it's usually used keep track of which variables are referring to jquery objects
[06:27:17] <jovrtn> one sec, peeking at your codes
[06:27:20] <srk9> Thanks, but it seems that the issue is that I had a single quote on one side and a double quote on the other. :/
[06:27:31] <metap0d> playr1983,jovrtn: Found it ... yet another semi colon where it shouldn't have resided
[06:27:38] <srk9> As for illegal names, this is a bookmarklet, so I can't do much about the illegal names in the page content.
[06:27:44] <jovrtn> hehe, sweet
[06:28:24] <Aamir> srk9:  yeah noted that just now
[06:29:17] <jovrtn> rachelw_: data is logging to the console just fine from inside the each loop
[06:29:18] <jovrtn> for me
[06:29:27] <rachelw_> hmm...
[06:30:52] <jovrtn> rachelw_: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/nqQgR/5/
[06:31:06] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/RpXsN/10/<-- anyone got idea how to fix this if i click on the ui button and select something it should resize now it resizes only when i click again
[06:31:06] <jovrtn> commented out a few things
[06:31:39] <rachelw_> jovrtn, you're right. how strange, I must have a different bug to what I thought then
[06:31:43] <rachelw_> thanks for looking...
[06:31:51] <jovrtn> sure thing
[06:33:35] <jovrtn> package_selected isn't defined in your original code
[06:33:40] <srk9> One more thing. I now have $("#ACE_\\$ICField104\\$1").length, which returns 1. I There are actually several IDs suffixed by numbers from 0 to n - 1. Is there any way to select all of them at once?
[06:34:29] <jovrtn> in the autocomplete callback
[06:35:33] <metap0d> jovrtn: A bit of an odd question ... but the end result of that function is to send the value of the dropdown to a php script, is there an easy way to tell it to not do it the very first time?
[06:35:52] <metap0d> jovrtn: Under current circumstance as soon as the page loads it will make a request needlessly
[06:36:30] <srk9> I am still new to this. It seems that I can do $("[id^=ACE_\\$ICField104\\$]").length
[06:36:39] <jovrtn> why's that?
[06:36:48] <srk9> Disregard my previous question.
[06:36:50] <jovrtn> change() has to be triggered by something
[06:37:01] <jovrtn> user input or a deliberate onready/onload trigger
[06:37:40] <metap0d> jovrtn: It is triggered by any change to the drop-down and since I use selected=selected on the first element ... I assume that is when it gets triggered the first time
[06:37:58] <jovrtn> ahh
[06:38:01] <jovrtn> let me try that
[06:38:36] <jovrtn> are you applying selected="selected" via jquery? or just in the html
[06:39:01] <metap0d> jovrtn: Just in the HTML
[06:40:33] <jovrtn> not triggering a change() on load for me
[06:42:39] <muzone> jovrtn: At http://www.webdevout.net/test?01H - are you sure I got the accordion classes right?
[06:42:50] <muzone> (that's a slightly improved version btw)
[06:45:28] <jovrtn> yes they're right
[06:45:45] <jovrtn> do a simple colour test before adding your background images
[06:46:02] <jovrtn> set these: #side_menu .ui-state-active { background: red; } and #side_menu .ui-state-default { background: blue; }
[06:46:08] <jovrtn> you can see for yourself that the states are correct
[06:47:55] <muzone> yeah i just firebugged it too, damn
[06:48:04] <muzone> i dont understand why my arrows wont show up though
[06:50:27] <diegocn> hello ppl.... is possible open a modal with jquery UI and  when hit close this modal the box animate to a fixed point in the page and then close?
[06:53:34] <Anitox> Has anyone used the datepicker with jQuery Mobile?
[06:54:02] <Anitox> wondering if it's in a usable state
[06:55:28] <dravekx> <33333333333333333333333333333 YOU
[06:55:30] <Trisox> http://dev.jtsage.com/blog/jqm-datebox
[06:55:33] <dravekx> just sayin
[06:55:53] <Anitox> thats interesting, thanks
[06:55:56] <jtsage> hmmm?
[06:56:04] <Raverix> dravekx: Not you again...
[06:56:27] <dravekx> Raverix, Im in a good mood today.
[06:56:31] <Raverix> :)
[06:56:44] <Raverix> dravekx: I'm sure I can fix that
[06:56:52] <dravekx> I'm going to break down and get into c5 hardcore this weekend.
[06:57:14] <dravekx> Raverix, hahah.
[06:59:06] <Raverix> G'luck.
[07:00:20] <sero|work> Having trouble figuring out why IE7 does not like this jQuery $('.programOptions li, .programOptions img').click(function(e){ ... }   however, it likes this $('.programOptions li').click(function(e){ ... }
[07:00:25] <dravekx> wishlist: jsfiddle makes a FF addon like pastebin
[07:00:59] <Anitox> ?
[07:00:59] <sero|work> is using the comma considered bad jQuery in any browser version?
[07:04:32] <frangio> does $('.programOptions').find('li, img') work?
[07:04:38] <codebeaker> I'm fairly new to javascript, but I think the author of http://fancybox.net/ is missing a paradigm that I think must come up more than onceâ¦ I ajax some elemets into the page, and naturally they are not there at dom-ready, so they don't get the initial $().fancybox() bindingâ¦ is there something like "live" that will bind to any element ever being introduced to the page ?
[07:05:31] <Anitox> cant you just use live or delegate on the 'load' event?
[07:05:42] <codebeaker> Anitox: honestly, I couldn't tell you
[07:05:50] <Anitox> i think that will work
[07:06:02] <codebeaker> the plugin author would have to use .live though, if I understand it
[07:06:22] <codebeaker> or, I could put the fancybox options into a global, and simply call it on each item as it's introduced to teh dom
[07:07:25] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/RpXsN/10/<-- anyone got idea how to fix this if i click on the ui button and select something it should resize now it resizes only when i click again
[07:09:27] <frangio> codebeaker: i think you're better off calling .fancybox() on the element on the ajax success event or something
[07:09:45] <Anitox> i agree
[07:10:15] <phlp> i concur
[07:10:17] <codebeaker> frangio: unfortunately, there's already some in the pageâ¦ and then I add some more
[07:10:22] <codebeaker> (bad design, I knowâ¦)
[07:11:21] <codebeaker> but, would it not be appropriate for the plugin author to implement this $live() thing?
[07:12:01] <frangio> no i don't think so. it might not be the wisest thing, performance-wise
[07:12:07] <codebeaker> ah, right enough
[07:12:18] <frangio> but if you wanna do it on your code you definitely can
[07:12:53] <codebeaker> I guess I could do itâ¦ yeah, right, at the moment it looks like this https://gist.github.com/04ddc75d764a2bafd0b8 I guess I can use .live()
[07:14:19] <crashev> I've got strange behaviour under IE8 -> $('#some').hide() does not hide the div, it hides all elements inside this div, but not this certain div - anyone experienced something similar ?
[07:15:00] <Anitox> IE8 is awesome ...
[07:15:22] <Anitox> you know you love it
[07:15:26] <staffang> it is?
[07:15:30] <phlp> <3
[07:15:39] <Anitox> everyone secretly loves it
[07:15:48] <crashev> right :)
[07:15:56] <crashev> life would be so easy if not ie
[07:16:03] <codebeaker> Anitox: what "Event" do I have here, is there a "loaded" event?
[07:16:14] <Anitox> it's like that stinky fat kid who cant fit in his own chair and keeps spilling over into your chair
[07:16:21] <phlp> i love how the default setting is to have every intranet site in compatibility mode
[07:16:23] <codebeaker> seems like I can't use live() to execute an arbitraty function
[07:16:39] <frangio> codebeaker: you could use the DOMNodeInserted event
[07:16:50] <codebeaker> cool, smoething to try :)
[07:17:09] <frangio> but it's apparently not compatible with any version of IE... http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/index.html
[07:17:28] <codebeaker> damn

[07:18:02] <r3v3rb> itssssss frrrrrreeeeeeeee
[07:18:13] <r3v3rb> not sure if that makes a difference ;)
[07:18:16] <phlp> it's a trap!
[07:18:17] <Anitox> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:18:34] <arian> Anitox, load events don't bubble, so it's a bit difficult to delegate them
[07:18:34] <r3v3rb> trap?
[07:18:43] <arian> also they don't have a target property
[07:18:46] <arian> (or it's null)
[07:18:49] <arian> check http://jsfiddle.net/S7xQf/1/
[07:19:08] <phlp> r3v3rb: only kidding, sounded like you were giving out free candy
[07:19:18] <r3v3rb> muhahahahahahaaaaaaa
[07:19:28] <r3v3rb> come in to my car... i have sweeties
[07:19:56] <codebeaker> I dunno what to do :(
[07:21:01] <arian> Anitox, also see this ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7702
[07:21:24] <Babbage_> hey all :)
[07:21:35] <codebeaker> https://gist.github.com/04ddc75d764a2bafd0b8 < that's the closest I can get (and yeah, I should use jsfiddle, but I dont think it can load fancybox)
[07:22:01] <VictorCl2> Hallow
[07:22:30] <Babbage_> <iframeelement>.load(function () { xyz(); }); <iframeelement>.attr("src", "about:blank"); should call a function xyz() after an iframe I have has completely loaded a new page shouldnt it?
[07:22:35] <VictorCl2> what is faster ...   "     thisTd.find("div.event div").html();   "  or   "  $("div.event div",thisTd).html();   "
[07:23:22] <phlp> VictorCl2: i believe the find is
[07:24:40] <Aamir> codebeaker:  you add external js files to jsfiddle http://gyazo.com/2af546db394d80d1a52f8cb00bddfcf9.png
[07:24:47] <codebeaker> ah, cool
[07:26:29] <paq> wierd thing.  I am trying the jquery.cookies.2.2.0.min.js pluging.  And I tested the $.cookies.test() function, and it is returning false as in my browser is not accepting cookies ie. disable, but when I check my browser settings, it is set to accept cookies
[07:26:32] <VictorCl2> how can I make this faster  ==    $("tr.tr_"+i+" td",$table).eq(index);
[07:26:40] <Aamir> Babbage_:  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/iframe-onload-in-webkit-browser
[07:28:51] <Aamir> VictorCl2:  if 'i' is different in loop than it should be an ID instead of Class?
[07:29:09] <codebeaker> just for the record, I'm going to use livequery, looks much simpler
[07:29:51] <VictorCl2> is in a loop
[07:30:02] <Aamir> codebeaker:  why not live or  delegate ?
[07:30:15] <VictorCl2> I have this loop on a table  .. tryhing to make it faster
[07:30:24] <codebeaker> because I can't get live to work
[07:30:31] <codebeaker> â¦ and delegate, I don't understand
[07:30:32] <Aamir> ?p @VictorCl2

[07:31:18] <Gruni> Hmmm. Weird. Can anybody take a short look at this and tell my, why tmptitle is only changed when I run this thing the second time? -> http://pastebin.de/17274
[07:31:21] <Aamir> codebeaker:  not a good reason but anyway the choice is yours. You can paste ur code on fiddle so people here can here a look n fix it for u
[07:31:23] <Gruni> Thanks in advice
[07:31:34] <VictorCl2> ok wait
[07:32:23] <codebeaker> Aamir: I'll try and make a fiddle for it, should be easy enough, I hope

[07:37:22] <Aamir> ahh
[07:37:27] <Aamir> chaw:  ^
[07:37:41] <chaw> i.e. I have an AJAX call that returns to me (adds to the DOM) new elements.. the new element that comes in, I want to make sure it adds a slider
[07:37:45] <chaw> ty Aamir :)
[07:38:21] <Aamir> chaw:  you can apply the slider after you create them in your ajax callback function ?
[07:38:24] <Rich_> Aamir, yeah but I can't maniuplate the code that way. It only works for me when i reload the whole document with document.body.load()
[07:39:15] <Aamir> Rich_:  your question is not clear :(
[07:39:28] <Aamir> .....mainpulate the html-elements that was loaded into the div...... ?
[07:40:12] <na3r> http://pastebin.com/57N5Bm1k
[07:40:39] <na3r> how can i access to "test" in p tag
[07:40:47] <na3r> by clicking on a tag
[07:42:46] <Rich_> Well, I have file called index.php. In the file there's a div with ID header. In that div i want to include a file called header.php which will be a login/logout kind of file. So when I press a loginbutton I want the button to change to a logoutbutton and set a session, but I don't want to update the whole page, only reload my header.php in the div.
[07:45:15] <m4xx> gnarf you still awake?
[07:45:19] <m4xx> *awake
[07:45:42] <Aamir> Rich_:  to reload, simply make it empty and than reload the header.php again?
[07:45:43] <Whirl3d> Good Mornin all. Anybody know why a jquery object, when passed from an ajax handler to a function loses it's jqueryness?
[07:46:13] <pachet> na3r: $('a').click(function(e){e.preventDefault();var pvalue=$(this).parent().children('p').html();//do whatever with pvalue//});
[07:46:33] <Aamir> Whirl3d: ?? it shouldn't  :|
[07:46:37] <pachet> or just $(this).prev('p')
[07:47:11] <Rich_> Aamir, ok I'll give it a try, because right now this: http://richardblilja.com/Skola/DD2390/Projekt/admin.js works, but it reloads the whole index.php file
[07:47:25] <phlp> VictorCl2: http://jsperf.com/vic-table-test
[07:47:43] <Whirl3d> in my ajax handler, i use a jquery object to place the ajax response in and set attributes and all that nice stuff. Then I call  configureMenu(jqueryobject) and in the first line of configureMenu(menujquery) it throws an error saying that Dom does not have the .attr method...?
[07:47:55] <chaw> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/tyW3X/
[07:48:15] <chaw> i have an array of divs that come in (depending on what exists in the database)
[07:48:30] <chaw> those divs, get sliders added properly... because they exist in the DOM on load
[07:48:39] <VictorCl2> ohh cool site
[07:48:48] <na3r> pachet, hi, it returns null
[07:49:07] <chaw> however, new similiar elements (with the same div class) should also get turned into a slider
[07:49:25] <VictorCl2> thanks gonna test my stuff there
[07:50:24] <m4xx> i'm trying to get the following code to work: http://jsfiddle.net/rkGjJ/ it should set the second option to selected. when alerting the val it works, but if you look at the .html() it doesn't
[07:50:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6gaun/15/
[07:51:17] <pachet> na3r: try just using $('p') as your selector
[07:51:20] <pachet> stepping out for a moment
[07:51:26] <Whirl3d> bye pachet
[07:52:19] <na3r> pachet, tnx it's working
[07:52:32] <m4xx> it works in 1.6 but 1.6 breaks a few of widget's i'm using =[
[07:52:36] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  try   console.log(mnu);
[07:52:57] <VictorCl2> phlp,  $table.find("tr").eq(i).children().eq(index);   that works pretty much faster .. thanks
[07:53:04] <na3r> pachet, what does e.preventDefault(); do ?
[07:53:12] <Prot> Can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/peRvp/2/
[07:53:12] <Prot> not sure why siblings/filter/children work differently than find()
[07:53:19] <phlp> VictorCl2: no problem :)
[07:53:22] <chaw> really simple question that im sure someone smarter than me can answer... i have a new dom element that shows up
[07:53:24] <Aamir> ?preventDefault @na3r
[07:53:24] <bot-t> na3r, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[07:53:27] <na3r> pachet, i removed it but nothing happend
[07:53:27] <Whirl3d> na3r, that stops propogation of the event
[07:53:31] <chaw> how do i ensure that when this new dom element comes in
[07:53:37] <chaw> a slider gets applied to it
[07:53:42] <Whirl3d> na3r, pachet went away for a minute.
[07:53:54] <D[4]ni> hi, i need to animate an image into another one - like fadeOut() the first one and fadeIn() the other one. but at exactly the same location
[07:53:58] <D[4]ni> how to do that? :o

[07:54:21] <chaw> :\
[07:54:29] <chaw> i've been trying live and load
[07:54:35] <chaw> :(
[07:54:47] <Whirl3d> chaw, how is the new dom element coming in
[07:54:55] <chaw> via an ajax call
[07:54:58] <chaw> and a .prepend
[07:55:17] <Aamir> D[4]ni:  something like  $('div').find('img').fadeOut('slow',function(){  $('otherImg').fadeIn('slow')  })
[07:55:39] <Whirl3d> in your ajax call, apply the method
[07:55:43] <Brammm> Hi guys
[07:55:50] <Whirl3d> hi Brammmm
[07:56:06] <Brammm> I'm building a facebook style To: input field
[07:56:06] <chaw> Whirl3d: I'm thinking I might just do that :\
[07:56:16] <D[4]ni> the first image should NOT go away completely before the other one starts to fade in
[07:56:23] <chaw> but then i have to call that method both there... and elsewhere.. suppose I could :\
[07:56:25] <D[4]ni> the animations should be at the same time
[07:56:36] <Brammm> but to catch all the clicks on the wrapper, the elements inside etc, I'm guessing I'll have to work with event bubbling etc
[07:56:43] <Brammm> anyone got any good reads/links on that?
[07:56:57] <Whirl3d> Brammm, lemee just tell you that we have someone who comes in here every day trying to do the same thing and he has not had any success, so I don't know if we can help
[07:57:16] <Brammm> hehe, thanks Whirl3d
[07:57:26] <Brammm> It doesn't need to be big, the basic problem I'm having at the moment is
[07:57:34] <Brammm> A div with a few spans in it and an input
[07:57:41] <Brammm> if i click on the div, the inptu gets focusse
[07:57:46] <Brammm> (oh and some links in the spans)
[07:57:48] <Whirl3d> Brammm, but that's not saying that you won't figure it out. LOL You already are approaching it differently..he just wanted everyone to do it for him. LOL

[08:01:04] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6gaun/15/
[08:01:08] <codebeaker> I've seen an implementation that binds `click` using live, and then triggers `click` âÂ but it then opens the popup, and redirects the user anyway
[08:01:13] <phlp> m4xx: http://jsfiddle.net/rkGjJ/1/
[08:01:21] <Brammm> Hmm, Whirl3d, don't think .trigger is going to help me.
[08:01:31] <codebeaker> I guess I should remove the href from the link, when it gets fancyboxedâ¦
[08:01:44] <Whirl3d> Brammm, drats! can you paste an example?
[08:01:47] <Brammm> I need to be able to catch a click on a div and a click on a child link in that div
[08:01:49] <Brammm> yeah sure
[08:02:11] <systemfault> codebeaker: I can't help much.. I'm just familiar with jQuery and Javascript, not fancybox :(
[08:02:18] <codebeaker> np
[08:02:33] <codebeaker> it's simply that it's not binding with live() so when I ajax elements into the page, they're not bound to fancybox
[08:02:58] <Brammm> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/xvV6v/
[08:03:14] <cybin> anyone knows the datatable plugin? I've got a problem when selecting the first row by clicking in the first column. If I know try to remove this row by using the default event handler provided in the examples, I get the error "Result of expression 'aoData' [undefined] is not an object". But only when I try remove the first row and it has been selected by clicking the first column. If I use the second column to select the row, everything is fi
[08:03:44] <bdiu> i need some help optimizing something...  http://rideamigos.com/events/rides/LIB2011  If you click the 'filter by' in the table header, you can hide/show various rows in a table.. but i have ~1000 rows in the table and it is CHOKING

[08:04:48] <_dave_h_d> hi all: I am looking for a good JavaScript documentor, can someone recommend one?
[08:04:51] <codebeaker> Aamir: thanks, that's as far as I got :)
[08:04:54] <Whirl3d> Bramm, explain in plain english what you want it to do.
[08:05:09] <codebeaker> regrettablyâ¦ that also makes the browser follow the /actual/ link, too - so the click trigger is unfortunate somehow
[08:05:13] <codebeaker> can you make up arbitrary events
[08:05:16] <Whirl3d> Bramm, click on an x and the option disappears, then focus on the input, right?
[08:05:29] <Brammm> Lol Whirl3d I solved it myself :' ) I just needed to replace the clicks and live functions with .bind()
[08:05:39] <codebeaker> so I could live-bind the fancyboxify to a non-existant event, and catch the click, and throw my own?
[08:05:40] <Whirl3d> lol, good news.
[08:05:46] <Aamir> codebeaker:  better http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/w2U6G/17/
[08:05:52] <phlp> bdiu: i think you need some paging on the table.. the page alone without the filtering is choking
[08:05:57] <Aamir> codebeaker:  u mean u already got this? :)
[08:05:59] <Brammm> What I want it to to do: when i click anywhere in the div, focus on the input, click on the X and the span disappears (not focussing on the input)
[08:06:10] <Brammm> click on the span itself, select it
[08:06:23] <codebeaker> I got as far as .live('click', function(){}).trigger('click);
[08:06:31] <codebeaker> â¦ but your unbind in the last is smart, that's perfect :)
[08:06:48] <Karai> Quick question for y'all: I have a table with the id of "songList". when i drag files onto the webpage, the table populated with rows and columns with the files's meta data. i have a .click() on #songList td to react to clicks (currently just posting to the console) but it only seems to react to hard coded tds, not dynamically appended oned from the drag/drop... is this intended?
[08:06:50] <Brammm> It works as I want it, though when clicking on a span, it also focusses on the input
[08:06:50] <juc0> Hi, i'm having an issue with nested templates when using the jQuery templater: http://jsfiddle.net/BQcaR/ Any ideas?

[08:07:45] <codebeaker> Cork[home]: you way, way lost me there, but I'll make a note of it
[08:07:47] <chaw> the issue with calling my addSlider method after my AJAX call is that it is going to re-apply the sliders
[08:07:50] <chaw> to the existing divs
[08:07:52] <Brammm> Cork[home]: I think that was meant for me? :p
[08:07:56] <chaw> as well as the new ones that I have added
[08:08:12] <Cork[home]> codebeaker: sorry was for Brammm
[08:08:16] <Karai> Brammm: http://k17.me/player/
[08:08:53] <Brammm> Karai: just use the .live() function instead of .click
[08:08:57] <Karai> oooooh
[08:09:05] <D[4]ni> Aamir: can't i define functions in jsfiddle?
[08:09:06] <Karai> sorry, I thought you were asking for a live demo haha
[08:09:08] <bdiu> I'll look into the pagination.. that's a good suggestion phlp... in the meantime, anyone have any suggestions for my filter code? Here's a gist with the relevant js
[08:09:09] <bdiu> https://gist.github.com/5f46f4205b26a5b507dc
[08:09:20] <Whirl3d> bramm, don't forget to select jquery in jsfiddle.
[08:09:21] <Aamir> D[4]ni:  why not :)
[08:09:44] <D[4]ni> it doesn't work for me.
[08:09:51] <Aamir> D[4]ni:  link?
[08:09:55] <D[4]ni> sec
[08:10:06] <m4xx> why would the val() of an element not be reflected in the .html()?
[08:10:08] <Cork[home]> Brammm: did you follow what i meant btw?
[08:10:27] <bdiu> thanks for looking by the way
[08:10:35] <Aamir> m4xx:  .val for inputs and .html for other elements
[08:10:39] <D[4]ni> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/XJQp7/
[08:10:56] <D[4]ni> ff4 web console says "start_grp_remove not defined"
[08:11:06] <Brammm> Yeah, I tried, didn't appear to work, but that solved itself, at the moment, I need to stop event propagation on my .selectable() elements
[08:11:25] <Aamir> D[4]ni:  u defined it but u need to call them ?
[08:11:33] <Karai> thanks, it worked :D
[08:11:42] <D[4]ni> in the onclick attribute..
[08:11:48] <m4xx> Aamir: can you look at the following please http://jsfiddle.net/VsaVw/
[08:11:54] <Aamir> D[4]ni:  ahh ok
[08:11:57] <phlp> bdiu: one suggestion is if it is that slow, drop the animation and just do show() and hide()
[08:12:07] <Cork[home]> Brammm: if you bind click on the div, it will react to all clicks even on elements inside it, if you then bind click on the x and stop the popagation there, div won't get the click event
[08:12:13] <m4xx> sorry didn't realize everyone was hitting you up
[08:12:18] <chaw> Whirl3d: :) if i apply the same method after my ajax call (which makes sense) .. it will apply it to all of the elements of that class...
[08:12:26] <phlp> m4xx: http://jsfiddle.net/rkGjJ/1/
[08:12:37] <chaw> i suppose i could get the last index of the item of that class and apply it only to that.. talking out loud helps solve problems :)
[08:12:55] <Brammm> Cork[home]: In the div are spans, in the spans are the links. I'm also clicking on the spans (combined with jquery ui selectable). The clicks on the spans are also focussing the input
[08:13:03] <m4xx> phlp: wow
[08:13:17] <juc0> Does anyone have any experience with the jQuery templater that can help?
[08:13:21] <m4xx> any chance of explaining why that works?
[08:13:24] <bdiu> phlp: thanks, i'll try that... i'm going to do pagination asap
[08:13:55] <na3r> text="test <br/>ajsd pajspja sp"
[08:14:05] <na3r> how can i remove <br/>
[08:14:20] <phlp> m4xx: it gets the dom element and uses the dom setattribute, not sure what jquery does differently
[08:14:20] <Aamir> m4xx:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/g7QrD/1/
[08:14:34] <Whirl3d> chaw, plus you might be able to use the $(this) scope in your ajax call to specify the currently loaded element.
[08:15:09] <Brammm> Cork[home]: I guess I could just defocus the input with every click on the span, but that just seems silly.
[08:15:14] <Aamir> m4xx: to get html u need to use $('select').find(':selected').html()
[08:16:20] <m4xx> Aamir, my objective was to create the list, set the value, then get the full html. phlp was kind enought to submit this if you're interested: http://jsfiddle.net/rkGjJ/1/

[08:18:03] <Aamir> Whirl3d: add jQUery than u will see a checkbox to add UI
[08:18:22] <D[4]ni> Aamir i see what the problem is - jsfiddle puts $(window).load(function(){ ... }) around the js source

[08:20:18] <phlp> Aamir: he wanted the full html that shows selected="selected" on the option element .attr wasnt updating it
[08:20:46] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: $().filter('[value=""]')
[08:20:48] <D[4]ni> and fade in at the same time as the cross fades out (it's doing that at the moment)
[08:21:04] <Aamir> tomasm-:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/rkGjJ/3/

[08:21:56] <ch3mical> industrial: it's probably not set
[08:21:57] <Aamir> phlp:  ahh sorry, got it :P
[08:22:04] <industrial> ch3mical: no, no, it is.
[08:22:07] <Cork[home]> industrial: border is a shorthand, try the longhand instead
[08:22:18] <industrial> I've set it with border: aswell
[08:22:20] <Aamir> industrial:  try borderWidth / borderColor
[08:22:24] <ch3mical> industrial: then it's not set using the shorthand border style

[08:23:31] <sdfsdf> bamccaig> will it be IENumberable type ?

[08:26:11] <Karai> Aamir: Thank you so much! <3
[08:26:22] <tomasm-> Cork[home], just once, actually
[08:26:53] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: if so then you can just add [value=Foo] at the end of the normal selector
[08:26:59] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: no need to run filter on it
[08:27:24] <Aamir> Karai: $('<tr/>').is a jQuery object not a normal js object so u cannot simply do something like u did in ur code :)
[08:30:14] <Karai> Aamir: Thanks for the tip, I really appreciate the help I get from everyone in this channel. :)
[08:31:04] <Aamir> :)
[08:31:05] <sraka1> hi
[08:32:18] <sraka1> does anyone know why this: http://pastebin.com/0bCHgpts doesn't work?
[08:32:29] <sraka1> it sends over the stuff over post
[08:32:44] <sraka1> but, doesn't return the html output to
[08:32:59] <sraka1> <div id="stanje">
[08:32:59] <sraka1>                 <p></p>
[08:32:59] <sraka1>         </div>
[08:33:27] <sraka1> :(
[08:33:56] <tomasm-> is using a click() handler sufficient for reacting to changes to a radio set? or is some other handler better?
[08:34:07] <spir> Aamir>many thanks
[08:35:16] <phlp> tomasm-: change() so the keyboard can be used
[08:35:52] <Aamir> spir :)
[08:36:05] <Aamir> ?p sraka1
[08:36:05] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:37:14] <Aamir> sraka1: just paste the code which has the problem. Dont copy paste your entire page :|
[08:37:58] <sraka1> but other sections of the page are relevant to the code
[08:37:58] <sraka1> !
[08:38:00] <sraka1> :)
[08:38:31] <Aamir> sraka1:  check ur ajax response in firebug
[08:38:54] <Aamir> ahh its not ajax :/
[08:39:37] <Aamir> it is :X
[08:40:23] <Aamir> sraka1:  yes, inspect the request and response in firebug or alert(data)
[08:41:22] <sraka1> did that
[08:41:27] <sraka1> and also
[08:41:28] <sraka1> http://jsfiddle.net/p8RdU/
[08:41:38] <sraka1> here's the weird thing
[08:42:00] <D[4]ni> you should possibly include all the <script> tags.
[08:42:05] <Aamir> ?down jsfiddle.net
[08:42:12] <bot-t> Aamir, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[08:43:13] <sraka1> anyways, it's sends a response
[08:43:20] <sraka1> but doesn't return anything back
[08:43:28] <sraka1> and the only http request is the request
[08:43:49] <sraka1> here's the site http://www.lajkaj.si/novipoll2.php
[08:43:56] <Aamir> sraka1:  if it does not return anything than whats the problem?
[08:44:16] <sraka1> the site it POSTs to returns data
[08:44:28] <sraka1> but the script doesn't print that data out
[08:44:32] <sraka1> even though it's supposed to
[08:44:50] <Aamir> sraka1:  http://www.lajkaj.si/pollpost.php
[08:44:56] <chaw> is there a way to recursively get children? i.e. i element.children('.className')  even if theyre not a direct child (could be a great or grand child )
[08:45:09] <Aamir> sraka1: this page does not exists
[08:45:20] <Gruni> Hmm. How can I access object attributes / parameters? (I need to get "responseText" from $.get(someurlquery) as a direct return.
[08:46:01] <Aamir> Gruni:  there is a callback function to get responseText
[08:46:29] <bartek> Hi there. Currently I attach ajaxStart and ajaxStop to a "spinner" div that is hidden to give the user some feedback to know they should be waiting for something. The code is simple: $("#spinner").hide().ajaxStart(function() { $(this).show(); }).ajaxStop(function() { $(this).hide(); }));
[08:46:43] <sraka1> AAmir: yes?
[08:46:48] <sraka1> sure it does
[08:46:57] <bartek> Problem is, this happens on every request and I don't want it to happen on the small, simple JS requests. Any other tips on how to do a global spinner like htis, but restrict it at times?
[08:47:05] <sraka1> it exists
[08:47:12] <Aamir> sraka1: first thing
[08:47:16] <Aamir> ?serialize @sraka1
[08:47:17] <bot-t> sraka1, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:47:23] <codebeaker> bartek: http://webification.com/wait-with-style-neteye-activity-indicator
[08:47:41] <Aamir> sraka1:  second http://www.lajkaj.si/pollpost.php
[08:48:07] <chaw> mmmmmm, trying to do myElement.find('.class') to get all elements at any level (child, grandchild, great grandchild) of that class
[08:48:27] <sraka1> Aamir: http://www.lajkaj.si/pollpost.php what's wrong with that?
[08:48:31] <Edler> anyone here understands javascript prototypes ?
[08:48:42] <donaldpcook> bartek, you should be able to set global to false for those small ones
[08:48:51] <Gruni> Aamir, could you please take a shot look at this? -> http://pastie.org/1893457
[08:48:51] <Aamir> sraka1:  can't u see :| Notice: Undefined index: prvaopcija in /home/lpusnik1/lajkaj/pollpost.php on line 3
[08:49:09] <blindMoe> eww pastie.org
[08:49:14] <blindMoe> can't stand their color schemes
[08:49:28] <donaldpcook> that prevents ajaxStart from triggering
[08:49:42] <bartek> donaldpcook: Yah, just saw that. Think I might go that route, cheers
[08:49:46] <Gruni> Aamir: Problem: I want to set "title" via the response from the .get-query. But the way I do it there, it's always "wrong". For the first try, title is empty. On the second try title is the response from the first try...

[08:57:01] <Guest34861> hi
[08:57:45] <Guest34861> .is() return true if at least one element matches selector. Is there way to check if all element matches a selector( .are() :) )
[08:57:58] <drecute> how can I slide a jquery slider automatically, http://codepad.org/NCodjOmk?
[08:58:02] <Fogin[Work]> is it posiable to use a selector like this ? $(form[value="inputform"])
[08:58:08] <sraka1> Aamir: I deleted that
[08:58:13] <sraka1> it was causing trouble
[08:58:21] <Aamir> sraka1:  try onError as well to the .post
[08:58:25] <drecute> how can I slide a jquery slider automatically? http://codepad.org/NCodjOmk
[08:58:26] <Gruni> Hmmmm. I'm nearly going apeshit with this .get-thingy >_<
[08:58:31] <Cork[home]> Guest34861: you would have to loop over the values to do that
[08:58:31] <sraka1> but thanks, a PHP script in my post file was creating a 404 http header
[08:58:39] <sraka1> didn't see that
[08:58:52] <Marz> Fogin[Work]: $('form[value="inputForm"]') yes
[08:59:06] <Cork[home]> value on a form??
[08:59:13] <Aamir> sraka1:  ahhhhhhhhh :/
[08:59:31] <Guest34861> Cork[home]: thx, just thought that there is other solution
[08:59:44] <Fogin[Work]> whole form but i sometime it wont have ID just a name
[08:59:58] <Fogin[Work]> And i want to catch all forms
[09:00:20] <MatthewG> /l/w 20
[09:00:31] <Cork[home]> Guest34861: $.inArray(false, $.map($(selector), function(elm) { return elm.is(selector); }))
[09:01:09] <askhader>  $('#aPasswordField').val('') does not have the desired effect but giving it any other string will.
[09:01:14] <askhader> Why can I not pass .val the empty string?
[09:01:41] <Cork[home]> askhader: setting the value to empty should work just fine
[09:02:06] <askhader> Cork[home]: I can set it to anything but empty. Setting it to empty has no effect.
[09:02:16] <Cork[home]> one min
[09:02:22] <askhader> I know because the default value="" is not being cleared
[09:02:59] <drecute> how can I slide a jquery slider automatically? http://codepad.org/NCodjOmk
[09:03:20] <phlp> askhader: are you wanting removeAttr('value')
[09:03:21] <Fogin[Work]> hmm $('form[value="inputForm"]').FormObserve(); does not work
[09:03:27] <askhader> phlp: I will try it
[09:03:56] <askhader> phlp: No effect
[09:04:09] <askhader> I am trying to clear a browser's cached password
[09:04:12] <askhader> From the form
[09:04:44] <Cork[home]> askhader: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/gx3DP/
[09:05:06] <Fogin[Work]> I am Trying to do $('#inputform').FormObserve(); but useing the name selector instead any tips ?
[09:05:12] <Marz> Fogin[Work]: in firebug type $('form[value="whatev"]'); and see what u get
[09:05:13] <askhader> Cork[home]: That's nice, but it's not working within my context for the empty string
[09:05:21] <Cork[home]> askhader: try setting autocomplete="off" on the input
[09:05:34] <Cork[home]> askhader: it is with an empty string
[09:06:00] <Cork[home]> askhader: sorry read wrong
[09:06:03] * askhader tries
[09:06:20] <askhader> Cork[home]: That worked, thank you
[09:06:34] <Marz> Fogin[Work]: also $('form').is('[name=whatev]') should work
[09:06:47] <Cork[home]> askhader: so you have your password stored :)
[09:06:57] <Gruni> Why are all examples always using damn alert()... :/ Need to pass a simple variable and it keeps me busy for 2 hrs now...
[09:07:23] <Cork[home]> Gruni: old habbits die hard
[09:07:34] <Gruni> :D
[09:07:39] <Cork[home]> Gruni: you can always overide window.alert
[09:08:05] <drecute> did anyone see my post?
[09:08:08] <Gruni> Nah, it's probably quite simple (but I'm not that kneedeep into jquery and its callback-functions)
[09:08:18] <Cork[home]> window.alert = function() { console.log.apply(console, arguments); };
[09:08:20] <Cork[home]> :)
[09:08:36] <Fogin[Work]> marz how do i do that in Firebug never done that befor
[09:08:40] <Cork[home]> hmm btw that can be even simpler
[09:08:46] <Cork[home]> window.alert = function() { console.log(arguments); };
[09:08:56] <Gruni> I simply need to return the response from $.get() right on that place where it runs.
[09:09:54] <Gruni> All examples work fine when using alert, but not when I try to use this respone within a tipsy tooltip. :D
[09:10:26] <Cork[home]> Gruni: sounds like it might be a race problem
[09:10:27] <Gruni> I know I'm doing something basically wrong, but I can't figure it out....
[09:10:42] <Cork[home]> Gruni: alerts stops the execution of js, other things doesn't
[09:11:09] <drecute> jquery with css: http://codepad.org/z7cvQR7F
[09:11:49] <drecute> how do I make the slider to start sliding automatically?
[09:12:35] <Gruni> Cork[home], could you please take a look at this? -> http://pastie.org/1893557
[09:12:40] <Fogin[Work]> ahh
[09:13:08] <Gruni> Cork[home]: I want to set tipsy's attribute "title" with the response from $.get()....
[09:13:27] <Gruni> On the first run, title is undefined, on the second run it shows the result from the first run.
[09:13:39] <Cork[home]> Gruni: you can't use return after an async call
[09:14:02] <Cork[home]> Gruni: the callback from .get will execute after return
[09:14:18] <Cork[home]> not before it, so you will return undefined to tipsy
[09:14:42] <chaw> can someone help me understand something for optimization... http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#chapter-9 look for the section titled Don't Act on Absent Elements
[09:14:52] <Cork[home]> Gruni: you have to revert your code, so that you call .get, and in its callback call tipsy instead
[09:14:54] <chaw> in there they have this example: http://pastebin.com/DzGiSjSa
[09:15:04] <chaw> I am trying to understand how the heck that last method works..
[09:15:29] <Gruni> Ah okay... Well, I'll try that. Thanks so far, Cork[home].
[09:15:32] <chaw> the 'doOnce' plugin
[09:15:33] <Fogin[Work]> Marz I dont get anything
[09:17:50] <Cork[home]> chaw: it works by adding it self to the same object as jquery
[09:18:26] <chaw> Cork[home]: hmmm
[09:18:30] <Gruni> Cork[home]... Hmm. It seems like I have to use another way to bind tipsy and get to my <a href rel=bla..>s, right?
[09:18:38] <chaw> I don't see where the function to be fired is included though
[09:18:51] <chaw> i.e. .slideUp()
[09:18:55] <Cork[home]> chaw: but i don't agree with them, cause the cost of just calling slideUp is for 99% of the time nothing to care about
[09:19:31] <chaw> hehe, i have been implementing the second 'good' method though
[09:19:35] <chaw> for larger functions/hooks
[09:19:45] <chaw> like.. if a page doesn't have element X.. don't try to act on element X
[09:19:53] <Cork[home]> chaw: ah...
[09:20:24] <Cork[home]> ya, look and see if tipsy has a way to restond with a title in the form of a callback
[09:20:35] <Cork[home]> chaw: what version of jquery are you using?
[09:20:52] <chaw> most recent
[09:21:00] <Cork[home]> in 1.6 there is a nifty solution you can use
[09:21:04] <Cork[home]> ?promis
[09:21:06] <bot-t> Cork[home], deferred.promise() - Return a Deferred's Promise object. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[09:21:11] <chaw> ...1.6
[09:21:15] <Dmbekker> I have a question about load(), I like to get contents of another file at the same server, but i want to send some POST variables with it (Service and url)
[09:21:36] <Cork[home]> chaw: you can use promise as the variable for return
[09:21:50] <Cork[home]> chaw: and then give the value in the callback
[09:21:51] <drecute> jquery with css: http://codepad.org/z7cvQR7F
[09:21:57] <Dmbekker> but i dont understand the docs (api.jqeury.com)
[09:22:02] <drecute> how do I make the slider to start sliding automatically?
[09:22:49] <Cork[home]> chaw: btw please use jsfiddle or jsbin instead of paste or anyother of those sites
[09:23:01] <Cork[home]> chaw: its alot easier to help if you do
[09:23:14] <Dmbekker> I think it is something like $("#url").load("short.php", {limit: 25} but i dont get where stands limit: 25 for
[09:23:19] <Dmbekker> or is that the post var?
[09:23:19] <chaw> :) sweet, thanks Cork[home]
[09:23:48] <Cork[home]> chaw: it solves it through some interesting js trickery :)
[09:24:02] <Cork[home]> it does something thats fundamentaly imposible XD
[09:25:48] <Dmbekker> any1 who can help me?
[09:26:17] <arian> Dmbekker, depends with what
[09:26:34] <Dmbekker> with my question i asked
[09:26:38] <ccmonster> hey giuys, on load I want to parse this XML file then create an object out of it but make it accesible to my JS going forward.
[09:26:44] <ccmonster> whats the best manner to do this.
[09:26:46] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/1893584
[09:29:25] <arian> Dmbekker, why not just use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ and set the type option to POST
[09:29:35] <Dmbekker> hmm
[09:29:40] <Dmbekker> will take a look at it
[09:29:56] <phlp> ccmonster: var $t = $(this), category = { name: $t.attr('name').trim(), ison: $t.attr('on'), .... };
[09:30:49] <ccmonster> did you see my pastie
[09:30:49] <ccmonster> ?
[09:31:01] <ppl> hi. I'm using the json2xml jQuery plugin. I also need to transform from xml2json so I used the other plugin with that name. However it seems that an empty element will be converted to an attribute when calling var s = $.xml2json(xml); $.json2xml(s); Any idea if there's a plugin that i can use which is compatbile with json2xml?
[09:31:19] <phlp> yes
[09:31:49] <phlp> (to ccmonster)
[09:32:25] <ccmonster> sodhi, i sorta did that , no ?
[09:32:38] <ccmonster> sorta*
[09:32:47] <jedimind_> hey, what are currently best ways to get standalone IE7/8 ?
[09:32:51] <jedimind_> assuming IE9 is installed
[09:33:04] <phlp> ccmonster: i was just suggesting a better syntax and caching $(this)
[09:33:11] <jedimind_> excluding VM
[09:33:14] <ccmonster> ah. i see.
[09:33:51] <ccmonster> i dont know jedimind, there might be extensions, or browsershots or that adobe product.
[09:33:57] <ccmonster> but i have no clue, as far as on one machine
[09:35:11] <phlp> ccmonster: you probably need to put the pages var in navigation (not the func) then use navigation.pages to refer to it if you want to use it other places
[09:35:45] <ccmonster> yea. i will
[09:36:00] <ccmonster> good catch. Just hadnt ported it all out of this other function i wrote.
[09:36:00] <VovaZaycev> Hi
[09:36:09] <VovaZaycev> can anyone explain this: INHERIT <a style = "color:red"> RED <a style = "color:green"> GREEN </a> INHERIT </a> INHERIT ?
[09:36:22] <ccmonster> im sorta recoding this very functional page loading into a more object literal setup
[09:36:25] <drecute> i have been able to present it well at http://jsfiddle.net/pbv9b/1/
[09:36:27] <VovaZaycev> Why one </a> clothes all tags?
[09:36:27] <SEJeff_work> So I've got a $.getJSON() running in a $(document).ready() block and it is running before some of the images on the page are loaded
[09:36:42] <SEJeff_work> How can I load the images before the javascript tries to get the json (which might take 3-4 seconds)
[09:36:46] <drecute> i'll appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks
[09:37:10] <ccmonster> whats the best format for that phlp , do i have to do pages:{}
[09:37:16] <ccmonster> or what?
[09:37:42] <ccmonster> or do i have to use this.pages[] or something
[09:37:53] <donaldpcook> SEJeff_work, $(window).load
[09:37:57] <phlp> var navigation = { pages: [], getPagesAndCSE: function() { ... } };
[09:38:03] <donaldpcook> callback runs after all images are loaded
[09:38:04] <drecute> please if you check the link, kindly refresh
[09:38:29] <SEJeff_work> donaldpcook, Thanks!
[09:38:33] <donaldpcook> np
[09:39:13] <Gruni> Cork[home], okay, I found a simpler way...
[09:39:14] <drecute> http://jsfiddle.net/pbv9b/2/
[09:39:20] <Gruni> .ajax has the option "async: false" <3
[09:39:20] <Gruni> :D
[09:39:33] <Gruni> Hail to the King, baby, it works!
[09:39:57] <SEJeff_work> Gruni, You can also do $.ajaxSetup() to do it for all $.ajax requests
[09:40:22] <Gruni> SEJeff_work yeah, but right now I'm not sure if I need async requests later... ^^
[09:40:53] <ccmonster> phlp, pages : [], init : function(){
[09:40:53] <ccmonster> navigation.pages = [];navigation.getComputedStyle();
[09:40:53] <ccmonster> }, // more functions...
[09:41:10] <ccmonster> does tha tlook about right? its working, but wasnt sure if that's proper.
[09:41:52] <phlp> looks good
[09:42:12] <ccmonster> can another object literal on the page access the navigation.whatever ?
[09:42:26] <ccmonster> so searcher.setupSearch(navigation.pages);
[09:42:27] <phlp> yes
[09:42:28] <ccmonster> for instance
[09:42:31] <ccmonster> ok cool
[09:43:39] <Yo0> I'm trying to use fancybox along with jquery functions, i seem to be gettting errors such as object doesn't support this property or method and b.opaticy is null ... is there a way to avoid conflicts with 2 scripts ?
[09:43:53] <ccmonster> opacity*
[09:43:58] <ccmonster> incase you just have a typo
[09:44:14] <Yo0> thanks ^^ i'm tired :P
[09:44:22] <Yo0> but it's correct in the code :)
[09:44:27] <ccmonster> no worries, we all know how it is.
[09:44:45] <ccmonster> pastie or jsfiddle the revelent piece of code and someone can help you debug if available
[09:44:48] <Jon47> Yo0 - the issue might be easier to troubleshoot with a fiddle
[09:45:10] <Jon47> more likely, the process of simplifying it in order to jam it into a fiddle will fix the bug
[09:45:42] <Yo0> i like it :) well i was working on it at work, i'm home now, so i will try and recreate it and come back on :)
[09:45:57] <ppl> Is there a jQuery plugin that can pretty print an xml string?
[09:46:49] <ccmonster> google for it. perhaps there is
[09:46:58] <ccmonster> or just use a chrome / firebug extension
[09:47:06] <sunsean> ppl: I recommend google-code-prettify
[09:47:12] <ppl> I search for one but didn't find anything satisfying so far.
[09:47:14] <ccmonster> if you just need to view it occasionally.
[09:47:48] <ppl> right now my xml is all one-line, i simply want it to be indented when i present it to the user as part of the html content
[09:50:55] <Jayflux> afternoon
[09:51:44] <ppl> I guess this somewhat work: http://refactormycode.com/codes/161-format-to-readable-xml
[09:52:01] <ppl> sunsean: Thanks for the suggestion but that's more then what I really need.
[09:57:24] <LSshock> as an idea, what if i wanted to test someone's internet speed really quickly, could i using some jQ magic? its for a video player to determine which quality should be downloaded
[09:58:12] <sunsean> LSshock: you could test how long it takes to for an image with a known file size to download.
[09:58:29] <LSshock> sunsean: that would work, how would i time such a thing?
[09:59:09] <drecute> hello
[09:59:38] <drecute> please I'll appreciate some help here: http://jsfiddle.net/pbv9b/2/
[10:00:35] <drecute> i want the slider to slide onLoad
[10:01:04] <LSshock> drecute: think you need jQuery UI for that
[10:01:24] <drecute> LSshock: I am using ui.slider
[10:01:35] <drecute> see http://guideboard.biz
[10:01:46] <LSshock> drecute: but you didnt add it to your example
[10:02:00] <LSshock> http://jsfiddle.net/pbv9b/3/ now it has
[10:02:19] <ch3mical> drecute: That is a very tiny person in that image
[10:02:25] <anebg> is there any way to serialize a javascript into a php serialzie variable ?
[10:03:56] <drecute> LSshock: did you say it si sliding?
[10:04:13] <LSshock> uhh no
[10:04:24] <ccmonster> phlp, is something like that code snippet, which turns xml into a js array best to be appended to the Dom via data(), or is it fine in the current arrangement where it's just accessed within the navigation obj?
[10:04:35] <LSshock> its really weird, but no error is put out, not really familiar with using the UI slider sorry
[10:05:40] <drecute> LSshock: ok. But one more thing, do you know how I can make it slide automatically?
[10:05:46] <drecute> LSshock: onLoad
[10:06:12] <LSshock> drecute: not sure what you mean, make it slide to the right slowly over time?
[10:06:12] <drecute> LSshock: i'm trying to use the change event, but don't get it yet
[10:06:30] <phlp> ccmonster: i dont see any reason to use data unless you have multiple versions of it related to different elements on the page
[10:06:44] <drecute> LSshock: i mean automatically do a slideshow onLoad
[10:06:58] <drecute> slide to the right, when gotten to the end, begin again from 1
[10:07:08] <ccmonster> Noobz, it's one parent obj i want to hold, then reference to build elements on the page as user requirements deem it neccessary
[10:07:18] <LSshock> drecute: uhm you need a slideshow plugin not the UI slider for a slideshow
[10:07:33] <drecute> LSshock: not slideshow per se
[10:07:56] <drecute> LSshock: i mean allow the slider to slide the image one by one
[10:08:12] <anebg> thanks
[10:08:34] <drecute> LSshock: setTimeout, then slide
[10:08:42] <LSshock> drecute: yeah
[10:09:15] <binni> using jquery and ajax I add things to a page, but if I leave the page and then return to it through the back button the changes have been undone unless I refresh 2 times (chrome), how can I keep the changes on "back"?

[10:17:47] <mustefaj> can i concatenate $(this) with classes
[10:18:09] <mustefaj> so $(this + " span.classname") ?
[10:18:55] <sunsean> mustefaj: are you looking for children elements?
[10:19:01] <gnarf> mustefaj: maybe you meant $(this).find("span.classname")  see ?find
[10:19:01] <bot-t> mustefaj, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[10:20:23] <mustefaj> hmmm
[10:20:36] <LSshock> drecute: sorry dont see how to use this but how about finding a plugin that can do what you want?
[10:20:56] <drecute> doesn't exist at the moment

[10:23:31] <drecute> LSshock: far from what i want
[10:23:45] <drecute> LSshock: but thanks anyway
[10:23:58] <moshtaghi> how can i change the Attributes of Cloned element before append it to page?
[10:24:42] <LSshock> moshtaghi: got any code to show, think it's $(this) once you got this to be the cloned element
[10:24:50] <sunsean> moshtaghi: see ?attr
[10:24:50] <bot-t> moshtaghi, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[10:24:54] <LSshock> drecute: then you're very vague on what you want ;o
[10:25:07] <LSshock> drecute: unless you got some kind of link showing it or close to it
[10:25:42] <moshtaghi> sunsean: tnx dude! ;)
[10:25:52] <drecute> LSshock: see http://jqueryfordesigners.com/demo/slider-gallery.html
[10:26:07] <drecute> LSshock: that's exactly what I've done at http://guideboard.biz
[10:26:23] <LSshock> drecute: they got a tutorial screencast how can you not make that work :o
[10:26:26] <drecute> LSshock: so the only thing I need now is to make it slide automatically
[10:26:49] <drecute> LSshock: i did make it work
[10:27:04] <drecute> LSshock: they did not make it slide automatically
[10:27:10] <LSshock> yours work way buggier
[10:27:13] <LSshock> true
[10:27:15] <drecute> LSshock: so I need to do that
[10:27:51] <drecute> LSshock: don't worry about the fact that the slider is not moving
[10:28:04] <drecute> LSshock: I don't really care about that
[10:28:13] <LSshock> :p hm
[10:28:38] <drecute> LSshock: my concern is that it should auto slide
[10:29:13] <LSshock> if you dont care about the slider then why why why are you using one?
[10:29:35] <drecute> i mean the handle
[10:29:44] <drecute> the scroller, whatever
[10:30:06] <moshtaghi> sunsean: pls sea this code! http://pastie.org/1893797 - i wanna change the name of select elements before append to page
[10:32:58] <sunsean> moshtaghi: What are you trying to change the names of the <select> elements to?
[10:33:41] <moshtaghi> sunsean: yep!
[10:34:06] <sashthebash> is there a good jquery plugin that i can use in forms to let users add/remove/edit multiple values? (e.g. user can add three email addresses to a list, and edit/remove them as well) It would be great if it plays along with Rails.
[10:36:02] <zw|w0rk> i have a callback that is being loaded via $.post, and in this call back I need to select something that loaded after the DOM has already been rendered..
[10:36:22] <sunsean> moshtaghi: Perhaps this is a start: http://pastie.org/1893810
[10:36:44] <zw|w0rk> I'm assuming, of course, this is my problem.  I could be wrong, but when I put <div id="test'></div> into the body with static code, I could select it, but I can't select it from the callback
[10:37:41] <zw|w0rk> is there something I need to do to select via $('#id') ?
[10:39:08] <moshtaghi> sunsean: hohoooooooo! tnx dude! it' work! ;)
[10:39:17] <Zerxer> zw|w0rk: if it's in the dom, should work fine
[10:39:20] <zw|w0rk> ah I must be doing something wrong, this can't be right.. hehe
[10:39:39] <muley> zw|w0rk: make sure your HTML is valid... i.e. check for duplicate IDs or something
[10:39:41] <zw|w0rk> I think i know the problem... I'm populating the element on a mouse click, it doesn't exist otherwise
[10:39:52] <zw|w0rk> so my design pattern is fundamentally flawed hehe
[10:41:22] <zw|w0rk> thanks for your time zerxer,muley!
[10:41:43] <RobW> hey what menu are they using: http://www.foofighters.com/us

[10:42:00] <muley> :D
[10:42:14] <Snerf> I am using a draggable/droppable, and I have 2 divs, one on top of the other (and smaller) with z-index. I want to drag an item, but when its over the smaller div on top of the bigger div, to drop onto that div, and not the one underneath it. any help appreciated
[10:44:16] <tauame> Hello, is there a way to validate an entire form without setting each field?
[10:44:46] <RobW> tauame: http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/
[10:44:50] <tauame> im using jquery.validate
[10:46:26] <tauame> can I do that only using jquery.validate.js?
[10:46:27] <sunsean> RobW: they are using CSS transitions
[10:46:47] <sunsean> moving the position of the background graphic
[10:47:18] <Bodanski> Does anyone know how to switch all button classes back to orignal state except  the one clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/7yYQ2/
[10:47:46] <RobW> sunsean: I see that but it's animated
[10:48:13] <knat> in jquery 1.6 attr('scrollHeight') is returning 'undefined', the exact same call with jquery 1.5 returns the scroll height, is this a bug or a feature?
[10:48:21] <sunsean> RobW: yes, the animations are inside the css file. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/
[10:48:32] <RobW> oh it's a css3 trans
[10:48:45] <RobW> is there a jquery equivalent?
[10:48:55] <RobW> (that you know of)
[10:49:30] <sunsean> RobW: something like $(...).animate({backgroundPosition:200})
[10:50:09] <joikus> how can i find my parent <li>
[10:50:19] <joikus> $(this).parent().parent() instead of doing that
[10:50:37] <sunsean> joikus: $(this).closest("li")
[10:50:48] <tauame> is there a way to validate an entire form without setting each field (using jquery.validate.js)?
[10:51:46] <joikus> i cant seem to get this work you guys,
[10:52:38] <joikus> line 10
[10:52:39] <joikus> http://pastebin.com/A4X6XPby
[10:52:45] <joikus> it doesn't dump the html in the element
[10:52:51] <joikus> but the html is there
[10:52:52] <sean`> "You were a dick and then you got radiation poisoning and now you're a giant dick"
[10:52:58] <joikus> is it because of nexted ajax posts?
[10:53:00] <samuel_> how do i get the value of an input field?
[10:53:00] <joikus> context issue?
[10:53:06] <sean`> ?val @ samferry
[10:53:07] <bot-t> samferry, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:53:08] <sunsean> knat: you might try using .prop('scrollHeight') I know they were just changing some things around that
[10:53:15] <sean`> samuel_, ^^ read what bot-t said
[10:53:20] <samuel_> $("#myInput").text() doesnt work?
[10:53:30] <joikus> nested*
[10:54:40] <joikus> obj.closest("li") is an [object Object]
[10:54:45] <joikus> but obj.closest("li").html() is null
[10:54:51] <joikus> but it cant be null how weird
[10:55:02] <sunsean> joikus: that's because you blow away obj online 7 when you do .html('Added!')
[10:55:52] <samuel_> is there something besides Date in jquery to hold ONLY A TIME VALUE?
[10:55:57] <samuel_> like TimeSpan in c#
[10:56:26] <sunsean> samuel_: time as in second since something happened?
[10:56:35] <samuel_> no time like
[10:56:39] <samuel_> 19:56
[10:57:13] <sunsean> why not use Date and just ignore everything but the time component?
[10:57:35] <samuel_> actually i need something to get a time value from a textbox like 15:00 and then set the other textbox to that time +2 hours
[10:57:49] <joikus> oh
[10:57:50] <samuel_> but don't really know how to
[10:58:35] <tauame> i would manipulate the string
[10:58:39] <tauame> without jquery
[10:58:48] <samuel_> thats an option yes
[10:59:02] <samuel_> but then i have to write my own method
[10:59:07] <tauame> yes
[10:59:20] <samuel_> like when the entered value is 23:00 and it ads +2 it should be 01:00
[10:59:27] <tauame> sure
[10:59:38] <tauame> this and the 22:00 case are the only problems
[10:59:46] <phlp> samuel_: http://www.datejs.com
[10:59:52] <samuel_> true
[11:00:43] <joikus> sunsean, you're right thx hmm

[11:03:04] <Fogin[Work]> var node = $(this); var myname = node.attr("name"); var ishidden = node. ???
[11:04:05] <Edler> you do
[11:04:18] <Edler> $("#inputId").attr('type') === "hidden"
[11:05:33] <Fogin[Work]> thanks
[11:06:11] <NiX8357Moonanemo> Fogin[Work], you can also use .is(':visible')
[11:06:36] <NiX8357Moonanemo> which'll also work for inputs of other types which are hidden using display:none or something
[11:08:11] <sunsean> samuel_: Does this work for ya? http://jsfiddle.net/Zj94V/embedded/result,js,html/
[11:08:12] <Fogin[Work]> so this should work var myname = node.attr("name"); 	var isHidden = node.is(':visible') if(myname != "somethingChanged" && isHidden){ blah ...}
[11:09:14] <phlp> isHidden = node.is(':hidden')
[11:09:58] <Fogin[Work]> right thanks :)

[11:46:42] <Prot> Can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/peRvp/2/
[11:46:43] <Prot> not sure why siblings/filter/children work differently than find()
[11:46:59] <Prot> my guess is its a jquery bug, but I wouldn't want to assume that
[11:49:31] <sunsean> Prot: I'm not sure why they would be different, but I believe technically settings an attribute to an empty string is like it not existing in the first place
[11:49:48] <LSshock> please check this line for me, var startTimer = setInterval(function(){ FirstTime(); clearInterval(startTimer); }, 2000); it wont clear it
[11:49:53] <Prot> sure, but why would filter() do one thing and find() do another
[11:49:54] <Prot> thats the question
[11:49:55] <sunsean> most boolean attributes like readonly use this style: readonly="readonly"
[11:50:01] <ccmonster> is there any jquery that just converts xml to json
[11:50:01] <Prot> yep
[11:50:05] <ccmonster> that is pretty solid?
[11:50:09] <Prot> i want to know which can be relied upon
[11:50:38] <sunsean> Prot: but that depends on how to you define if an attribute exists
[11:50:45] <Prot> no it doesn't
[11:51:04] <Prot> we're talking about find() and filter() working differently on the same element/attrib
[11:51:41] <sunsean> ok I see what you're saying, you mean regardless of how it's defined it should be consistent
[11:51:44] <Prot> yep
[11:51:55] <Prot> in which case I have to assume its a jquery bug, and report it
[11:52:00] <Prot> but usually when I think that I'm wrong
[11:52:33] <ajpiano> Prot: that's definitely weird, file a bug!
[11:52:40] <sunsean> line 3 looks like it might have been intentional to find empty string attributes, but I think line 2 might be a bug
[11:53:34] <b1nd3r> Hello. Why some jquery methods return to the main function and some others not? Like the each and the ajax? Ajax returns but each not, seens to only return to the each function. Maybe a bug?
[11:53:35] <Prot> awesome
[11:53:37] <Prot> do I get a prize?
[11:53:59] <Prot> whats a better way to display a jquery set than console.log() for purposes of showing the bug
[11:54:18] <sunsean> Prot: yes: http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt112/ausador/win-one-internet.jpg
[11:54:47] <ajpiano> Prot: console.log is fine for a testcase like this
[11:55:09] <Prot> k
[11:55:11] <Prot> how exciting!
[11:55:14] <ajpiano> the other option is to like create some css classes and apply  them to the elements as they're matched so you can see visually
[11:57:00] <ianez> Hello, I was looking at jQuery but noticed that the latest version has some open bugs so my question is: is there a bug-free / stable version of jQuery (maybe an old one)? thanks :)
[11:58:33] <Snerf> ianez, you can easily use older versions. http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.min.js , just pick the version you want in place of 1.5.2
[11:59:08] <Prot> my solution is to use [data-info=] every time
[11:59:10] <Prot> looks ugly tho
[12:00:08] <sunsean> Prot: Hey that's offensive to robot happy faces.
[12:00:12] <ianez> Yes but how do I know what's the best version of jQuery to use (stable/bug-free) ? I dont see a "stable" release on the website :\
[12:00:53] <Snerf> ianez, maybe a better solution is, what is the problem that you are having, maybe it is not a bug
[12:01:30] <sunsean> ianez: in general the last minor release of ever major version is stable. so 1.5.2, 1.4.4, 1.3.2, 1.2.6
[12:01:41] <ianez> I have no particular problems.. I was just wondering .. cause "latest version" doesn't always mean it's perfect
[12:02:10] <Snerf> ianez, by that thought, no version would be perfect, or there would never be future releases
[12:02:22] <ianez> true :)
[12:02:25] <ajpiano> ianez, 1.6.1 is out today, should address a lot of the issues in 1.6
[12:03:25] <ianez> I usually get the latest version of jQuery every time I start a new project.. but I noticed some regression-bugs so I'm starting to think that maybe I should stick to a "stable" release :)
[12:03:53] <Snerf> I use 1.5.2, more then happy with it
[12:04:23] <Prot> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9261 pwnt
[12:04:33] <ajpiano> ianez: historically, people seem to tend to wait after a major release has a point release or two to clean up after itself
[12:04:39] <ajpiano> what happens is that we do RC's and betas
[12:04:49] <ajpiano> but there is not really a critical mass of testing
[12:04:52] <ajpiano> and then the final comes out
[12:04:58] <Prot> hmm wikicode is not applied n the ticket for some reason
[12:04:59] <ajpiano> and then people like omg BUGZ
[12:05:21] <ajpiano> not a critical mass of people* testing
[12:05:22] <daleharvey> whats the correct way to get the content type from an ajax request? $.ajax({success:function(res, stat, xhr) { xhr.getResponseHeader("Content-type" ?
[12:05:45] <LSshock> please check this line for me, var startTimer = setInterval(function(){ FirstTime(); clearInterval(startTimer); }, 2000); it wont clear it
[12:06:27] <Prot> i don't think startTimer variable has a value when the function is called
[12:06:35] <Prot> i may be wrong tho
[12:07:08] <sunsean> LSshock: in that situation you would just use setTimeout, but assuming you've cut out something else important, that looks like it should work
[12:07:59] <LSshock> firsttime() works, but the interval keeps calling it
[12:08:31] <samuel_> var regexp = new RegExp("/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/");
[12:08:32] <samuel_>             if ($(this).val().match(regexp))
[12:08:32] <samuel_>                 alert("match");
[12:08:39] <samuel_> why dont I get a match on "08:15"
[12:09:26] <samuel_> anyone?
[12:09:35] <sunsean> LSshock: works here: http://jsfiddle.net/sunsean/d8zvM/embedded/js,result/
[12:10:14] <samuel_> ?
[12:10:37] <phlp> samuel_: if (/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/.test('08:15')) alert("match");
[12:10:37] <sunsean> samuel_: did you try regexp.test( $(this).val() ) ? and is $(this).val() what you expect it to be?
[12:10:51] <LSshock> sunsean: dang thats so weird, swear i got the same thing here but so far it has run it 480x :p
[12:11:09] <LSshock> sigh, something silly taking me 30min already
[12:11:45] <pifantastic> samuel_: http://jsfiddle.net/c2Nrf/
[12:12:37] <samuel_> huh, doesnt it return a bool on success/failure?
[12:13:34] <LSshock> can i get a reminder how i can use a variable in two quotes, like if i want to add a variable number to a id name of a div i make, $('#boxes').append('<div id="box$variable"'); <- just to illustrate what i mean, resulting in id="box1" so on
[12:14:04] <sunsean> LSshock: "box'+variable='"'
[12:14:05] <phlp> samuel_: .match returns the matched strings, .test returns bool
[12:15:19] <samuel_> ty
[12:17:44] <LSshock> arg
[12:20:55] <gnarf> samuel_: you don't want the "/" on the new Regexp
[12:21:03] <gnarf> ?js new RegExp("/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/");
[12:21:04] <bot-t> gnarf: /\/^d{2}:d{2}$\//
[12:21:36] <gnarf> ?js re = new RegExp("^\d{2}:\d{2}$"); "08:15".match( re )
[12:21:36] <bot-t> gnarf: null
[12:22:13] <gnarf> ?js "08:15".match( /^\d{2}:\d{2}$/ )
[12:22:14] <bot-t> gnarf: ["08:15"]
[12:22:43] <LSshock> sunsean: what i if i need to wiggle trailersQ[playIndex].url + qualitySetting + 'p.mov' into the id (without box that was an example) i was hoping i could get it too work but i cant no matter how i throw around the quotes
[12:22:48] <gnarf> samuel_: easier (unless something is dynamic) to define regexps with just /re/
[12:23:01] <LSshock> sunsean: it works when i try it out in the log (the line creating the url)
[12:23:40] <sunsean> do you have a jsfiddle of this?
[12:23:56] <gnarf> LSshock: why are you setting so much in the id?
[12:23:57] <gnarf> ?valid id
[12:23:58] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[12:24:01] <abjorn> i have a jsfiddle of everythign
[12:24:48] <LSshock> gnarf: sorry, src :x id was about my example (sheesh i complicate things more when trying to simplify it)
[12:25:33] <LSshock> iv been at this thing for 12hrs solid just 2 more bugs and i can rest
[12:26:01] <LSshock> if it wasnt for this channel probably more hours
[12:32:57] <sshaginyan> Hi guy on this page http://www.kgbcustoms.com/tracking when I refresh the page jquery-ui tabs will first display the links to the tabs and then snap to the tabs. Is there anyway we can get rid of this?
[12:33:23] <sshaginyan> Tell me if I'm not clear
[12:33:41] <airstrike> does this work in ie6? http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#default
[12:33:47] <airstrike> i'm guessing no
[12:34:10] <sshaginyan> I think what I'm trying to say is there anyway I can load my javascript first before I load the html?
[12:35:22] <gnarf> ?tias @airstrike
[12:35:23] <bot-t> airstrike, Try It And See
[12:35:50] <gnarf> airstrike: it should...
[12:36:19] <LSshock> he might not have IE :p
[12:36:21] <misterm> sshaginyan: there's a bunch of stuff you can do to minimize it
[12:36:37] <sshaginyan> misterm: Like what?
[12:37:00] <gnarf> LSshock: then why does he care if it works in IE?? I would assume any of us to have an IE6 VM if we need to support it
[12:37:14] <misterm> sshaginyan: tweak the css to get the base page as close to the final result as possible
[12:37:38] <misterm> or you can just hide it until everything is loaded and ready
[12:38:05] <LSshock> gnarf: fair enough ;]
[12:38:37] <sshaginyan> misterm: What do you mean base page?
[12:38:38] <enapupe_> Anyone knows a plugin to report a error in a page? Something that grabs a screenshot and description? Like youtube's
[12:38:56] <airstrike> gnarf: i'm on linux...
[12:39:11] <airstrike> can't try right now
[12:39:36] <airstrike> so i was wondering if one of the thousands of #jquery users could tell me
[12:39:43] <misterm> sshaginyan: the page before any javascript is run
[12:39:48] <LSshock> here's the actual example i meant http://jsfiddle.net/4HyEZ/ trying to get the created link in the href
[12:41:09] <renancoelho> Hi there, can anybody tell me their opinion on a good jquery plugin to slide li* just text in it. Thanks!
[12:43:05] <fission6> what a simple tool tip plugin
[12:43:19] <fission6> jquery can do that renancoelho
[12:43:57] <renancoelho> as in a function? sorry, I'm a noobie...
[12:44:04] <outer_space> inside of a $(document).ready() function using $('#adiv').width() always returns 0, if i do it manually after the page loads it works
[12:44:21] <outer_space> is it possible to get a div width in $(document).ready() ?
[12:44:27] <enapupe_> Is it possible to grab a printscreen of the page?
[12:44:54] <enapupe_> I'm looking for a tool to report erros in page, where the user can select an area of the page and submit with a comment..
[12:45:51] <Snerf> I have 2 droppables, one smaller on stacked on top another. Is there a way to make it only drop on the smaller when that is selected? it is always dropping on the larger lower one
[12:46:22] <blk_panther> can I give an array of functions to a function and loop through them and execute them?
[12:47:52] <blk_panther> or like, give the names of the function and do an $eval or something?
[12:48:34] <phlp> anyone know why i'm getting this garbage ï»¿ at the beginning when i do jsmin <file.js >> newfile.js in windows
[12:50:33] <Prot> looks like my bug was accepted
[12:50:41] <Prot> now maybe they'll hire me over at jquery
[12:50:48] <jinxdone> blk_panther, just add () to execute the function when you loop through your list?
[12:51:24] <jinxdone> blk_panther, something like for(var i = 0; i < funclist.length; i++) { funclist[i](); }
[12:51:42] <sunsean> Prot: you can come work at BioWare with me. We have a front-end position open =)
[12:51:42] <blk_panther> I'll try
[12:51:53] <Prot> you're joking right?
[12:52:02] <sunsean> no joke
[12:52:10] <Prot> bioware?
[12:52:16] <sunsean> the one
[12:52:17] <Prot> like the bioware?
[12:52:37] <sunsean> Yup, I bang on swtor.com all day.
[12:52:58] <Prot> no shit. i know one of the guys who did the music
[12:54:02] <jinxdone> phlp: why the double >> when redirecting to newfile.js?
[12:54:35] <ThemNuts> sup, when selecting an <option> i want an <input type='text'> to appear so i can add a method that is not included in the options. I have everything working except when i enter a value in the <input type='text'> it replaces the <option>text but not the value (as it still sends trough 'andere'). This is the code -> http://pastebin.com/dfPDzqGm
[12:54:38] <phlp> jinxdone: i'm appending multiple jsmin calls to the same file
[12:55:10] <jinxdone> phlp, so what is the 'garbage' ?
[12:55:29] <phlp> ï»¿
[12:55:51] <phlp> whatever that is
[12:56:57] <b3ngt> Hi, I've got an event (mousewheel) that I've coded to change an Image. The image is preloaded when the site loads (NET-tab says so aswell in firebug), but when I change src it takes, time to change. It goes white and then changes. Any common misstake or should I paste code?
[12:57:10] <phlp> i guess i'll just generate multiple .min.js files then copy /b them all. seems to work that way
[12:57:20] <sshaginyan> misterm: Thank you so much
[12:57:30] <Zerxer> ThemNuts: update the .val() of the option too then instead of just the .html
[12:57:31] <blk_panther> hmm, a working example would be great jinxdone ... getting functionlist[i] is not a function :/
[12:58:08] <SirFunk_> is there a way to tell if an element is attached to the dom or not?
[12:58:10] <blk_panther> perhaps executeFunctionByName will help, I'll try
[12:58:33] <jinxdone> phlp, does jsmin make unicode files? might be the unicode tag you're getting in between there
[12:59:14] <ThemNuts> Zerxer: how would i do this? The Html doesn't really has to be changed, its te val i want changed
[12:59:37] <b3ngt> SirFunk_: $('some_element).length, if that gives > 0 the element is in the DOM.
[12:59:47] <SirFunk_> good call, thanks
[13:00:18] <Zerxer> ThemNuts: .val(new value)
[13:00:48] <Zerxer> ThemNuts: if that doesn't actually update the value of the selected option, because of it not actually being the main input, do .attr('value', 'new value')
[13:01:01] <noregret> is there any JQuery plugin to use for input validation?
[13:01:08] <ThemNuts> thanks man
[13:01:17] <b3ngt> noregret: yes
[13:01:22] <timmywil> any require users here? http://jsbin.com/awoze5/edit  Trying to load jquery from the cdn and have it continue working after using the optimizer
[13:02:09] <b3ngt> noregret: Take a look here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[13:02:24] <noregret> b3ngt: thanks
[13:05:13] <zatan> Hi I am trying to run jquery through chrome Inspect Element but, then I tried to $("#nav").hide()  i Got ,TypeError: Cannot call method 'hide' of null    what can be wrong?
[13:05:41] <ravenzz> there is no #nav element
[13:05:43] <ravenzz> ?
[13:06:54] <b3ngt> The problem I have, can it be because I delete all the images in the div, and then adds a new one instead of changing the src of the existing one?
[13:06:57] <blk_panther> ok got it
[13:07:28] <djQuery> zatan open onsole and try console.log($); and see what u get
[13:08:28] <zatan> djQuery, http://dpaste.com/541758/
[13:13:37] <djQuery> zatan:  now try the same thing with jQuery instead of $
[13:14:23] <phlp> jinxdone: you were right, some files were utf-8. made them ansi and the garbage is gone

[13:24:46] <e-lena> why don't css people ever respond ?
[13:24:59] <e-lena> on #css channel that you recommended
[13:25:01] <jinxdone> LSshock: http://jsfiddle.net/4HyEZ/1/ like so?
[13:26:42] <LSshock> jinxdone: my bad forgot to add the variables, http://jsfiddle.net/4HyEZ/2/
[13:27:05] <LSshock> uhh wait
[13:28:38] <LSshock> jinxdone: yours worked, thanks a bunch!
[13:32:45] <wookiehangover> wat
[13:45:52] <LSshock> if i have a variable like 142.128936198236 how can i just use whats in front of the period?
[13:46:11] <fission6> int
[13:46:20] <fission6> woops wrong channel
[13:46:50] <atula> LSshock: parseInt(142.128936198236, 10) would give you what you need.
[13:46:56] <misterm> LSshock: what type do you want it to be? (also not really a jquery question)
[13:48:28] <fission6> LSshock, does parseInt(s) work
[13:48:50] <misterm> LSshock: if you want a number you can do Math.floor(var), Math.round(var), or var >> 0
[13:49:12] <misterm> LSshock: if you want a string, you can do var.split(".")[0], amongst other things
[13:49:13] <LSshock> its a result of seconds from a plugin just need the rough normal seconds number

[13:54:09] <friskd> Issue:  I have an element, i hover over it.   When i hover over it, i have a tooltip load(the tooltip is note inside the hovered element) i just dynamically place it in the correct location.   Now my mouse is hovering over an element that i placed under it. I want to get the id of the element my mouse is hovering over at any given time.
[13:54:10] <ch3mical> friskd: You would have to bind a hover event on every element with an ID that sets a global var, probably
[13:54:21] <orolo> the question is in the fiddle link. but i think its: "how do you add option event callbacks to a jQuery plugin?"
[13:54:24] <Deeply> heh
[13:54:34] <Deeply> misterm is the name I couldn't remember. :)
[13:54:49] <ch3mical> orolo: too vague
[13:54:58] <orolo> ch3mical: an example:
[13:55:12] <friskd> ch3mical:  so there is no getMouseOverElement ? hehe
[13:55:25] <ch3mical> friskd: not that I ever heard of
[13:55:34] <friskd> which essentially would say, where is the mouse, what element is it directly over..
[13:55:38] <friskd> return that element.
[13:55:55] <ch3mical> You might look into jQuery UI for a solution, it does things like that
[13:56:06] <friskd> ok.
[13:56:16] <orolo> (from jqueryui) $('#div').datepicker(function({ open: function(){}, close: function(){}, someOtherEvent: function(){}); how do you add 'open', 'close' and 'someOtherEvent' to a plugin?
[13:56:17] <ch3mical> So there's probably some function you could just use as an example
[13:56:31] <misterm> orolo: you just add an argument for the callback, and then call the callback at the appropriate time
[13:57:08] <ryanneufed> how do I get the name of a function that's been passed as a parameter?
[13:57:20] <misterm> orolo: you might want to .apply() the callback and set the context to the relevent element as well
[13:57:22] <orolo> misterm: i hear you, but i don't understand. in my fiddle, when a user clicks toggle and a div has a certain class then i want the callback to be fire. but i don't know how to impolement.
[13:57:43] <ch3mical> orolo: I would try using .extend or .fn.extend
[13:57:56] <orolo> ch3mical: well.. . it's my plugin.
[13:58:06] <misterm> orolo: when do you want the callback to fire?
[13:58:31] <ch3mical> orolo: ok
[13:58:33] <orolo> misterm: when ($('#toggle-on').hasClass('dimmed') === false) and the oposite.
[13:58:51] <misterm> orolo: ok, and how does that happen?
[13:58:55] <orolo> misterm: so the user can 'doStuff' when the toggle is switched.
[13:59:07] <orolo> misterm: on ('#toggle-on, #toggle-off').mousedown(function()
[13:59:14] <misterm> orolo: how does the class "dimmed" get changed?
[13:59:24] <orolo> misterm:                 $('#toggle-on, #toggle-off').toggleClass('dimmed', 50);
[13:59:41] <orolo> misterm: ah. i think i'm starting to get it.
[13:59:49] <misterm> orlo: ok, so accept a function (or functions) as arguments
[14:00:12] <misterm> orlo: and right after you change the class, or when its done, call the callback provided
[14:01:09] <ralc> hey guys. I have a page with a lot (~100) of checkboxes. When the user hits a checkbox, some field should appear. My idea is to loop over the objects for the checkboxes, and attach an onclick or onchange hander, but since there's so many im wondering if what im about to do is wrong. Any thoughts?
[14:01:14] <orolo> misterm: so how do i roll that into an option? like $('div').plugin({ callback: function() }); ? or will that work? "callback" is my parameter?
[14:01:24] <misterm> in
[14:01:44] <misterm> orolo: *in that case you're taking an object as an argument that contains the options
[14:02:12] <potatode1on> Hey Y'all.  I want to build a HTML form dynamicly using jQuery from a JSON object.  Are there any tools for doing this ?
[14:02:26] <misterm> orolo: so your function definition would be something like: plugin = function(options){}
[14:02:47] <misterm> orolo: and insite the function, you access options.callback, or options.whatever
[14:03:05] <orolo> misterm: ah. dot notation.
[14:03:26] <orolo> misterm: ok. thank you. that was helpful.

[14:04:02] <Deeply> heh
[14:04:05] <misterm> orolo: might want to check out that tutorial
[14:04:09] <Deeply> misterm, this is still kicking my butt :)
[14:04:21] <misterm> Deeply: what is?
[14:04:34] <Deeply> the same thing that I was working on yesterday.
[14:04:52] <Deeply> I just don't get why jquery isn't letting this work
[14:05:30] <Deeply> perhaps I'm asking it to do an impossible task :
[14:07:05] <misterm> Deeply: hah, I doubt jQuery isn't "letting" it work :-)
[14:07:15] <misterm> or not
[14:07:51] <Deeply> I dunno. I'm still trying to figure it out
[14:07:55] <ch3mical> Man, I love jquery.cookie.js
[14:08:25] <Deeply> in js, i can scan a barcode, it finds the @ at the end of the string, and splits it, fills the other 2 text boxes, and pops up an alert
[14:08:37] <opie-x> ch3mical: i bet you love this http://goo.gl/1qHWr , don't you?
[14:08:50] <Deeply> my barcode scanner sees ID|PW%V but the output is ID|PW@
[14:09:10] <Deeply> when I try converting this thing to use jquery no dice
[14:09:48] <misterm>  Deeply: you're probably doing something wrong
[14:09:56] <misterm> though Im sure you realize that
[14:10:05] <Deeply> I've had other people try
[14:10:42] <misterm> do you have a working example?
[14:10:49] <Deeply> in js? yes
[14:10:56] <Deeply> one moment
[14:11:14] <Deeply> and I know the barcode scanner is putting out the correct value because i can scan it here in channel and it works
[14:11:16] <Deeply> ID|PW@
[14:11:18] <Deeply> ID|PW@
[14:12:37] <ch3mical> opie-x: lolz
[14:12:49] <ch3mical> opie-x: I'm printing that one

[14:14:19] <misterm> 't see any jQuery
[14:14:58] <sven_oostenbrink> If I $.load() a .html file which contains jquery javascript, do I need to place these also in a $(document).ready(function(){.......}); function? because, AFAIK, the document is ready, so the .ready() function won't fire again, will it?
[14:15:28] <Deeply> there is none. that's the js version so you can see what it does
[14:15:50] <misterm> Deeply: oh I was asking because you said "jQuery isn't letting this work"
[14:15:53] <Deeply> if you type in ID|PW@ into the barcode box it should pop up an alert and fill in the other 2 boxes
[14:16:22] <Deeply> I tried doing the same thing using jQuery, as have other people on here, and it's just not doing what it does when it's straight js
[14:16:34] <milardovich> Hello guys
[14:16:41] <milardovich> I'm trying to apply some effects to a div
[14:16:50] <milardovich> but the problem is that I have 2 other divs in that div
[14:16:57] <milardovich> something like this:
[14:16:58] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/JVMzHWwc
[14:17:27] <misterm> Deeply: they're doing it wrong probably
[14:17:34] <milardovich> I want to apply an opacity change in "main", but "first" and "second" shouldn't be affected
[14:17:39] <milardovich> is that possibly?
[14:18:32] <Abjorn> milardovich: you'll have to explicitly state the opacities of the two inner divs
[14:18:49] <Deeply> well, i've noticed if I change the barcodechange routine it messes up quite nicely :)
[14:19:35] <phlp> any idea why all my ajax would stop working in ie after jsmin? works in ff4 and no errors in jslint. ie doesnt even attempt the connection
[14:20:02] <misterm> Deeply: what barcode method, and change how?
[14:20:08] <karega> xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=ISO-8859-1"); isn't changing the request headers
[14:20:10] <milardovich> Abjorn: I have sth like this: http://pastebin.com/vLHPkfZ0
[14:20:18] <milardovich> Where should I put the other states?
[14:20:29] <Abjorn> in CSS
[14:20:33] <Deeply> even changing this line document.getElementByID.('submitbutton').click(); to use jquery causes it to mess up
[14:20:49] <Abjorn> set the CSS of the two inner divs so that they have opacity explicitly set to 100%
[14:20:56] <milardovich> aha
[14:20:58] <milardovich> ok
[14:21:01] <milardovich> let's see
[14:21:59] <milardovich> Abjorn: it doesn't seem to work properly :-P

[14:22:50] <misterm> Deeply: the vanilla version has an error
[14:23:10] <Deeply> oh?
[14:23:18] <amirite> whats the proper way to change the width of a ui-dialog
[14:24:20] <Deeply> which vanilla version and where do I get a proper version?
[14:24:28] <misterm> Deeply: yea, tho its probably just from you copying it to the fiddle, initform is not defined
[14:24:38] <misterm> Deeply: it's not great practice to put your js in the markup btw
[14:25:20] <LSshock> trying to make a pause/play button but it only works on the first press http://jsfiddle.net/rJMss/
[14:25:35] <LSshock> also tried the normal click, not live, either one wont work can't spot whats wrong
[14:26:40] <Deeply> js in the markup?
[14:27:16] <misterm> yea, like event handlers, you should attach them in your script rather than inside the tags
[14:27:41] <amirite> how come jquery ui's positioning is so terrible w/ fixed width layouts?
[14:27:45] <amirite> is there a way to overcome?
[14:28:56] <misterm> Deeply: that might be why your jQuery version doesn't work incidentally
[14:29:35] <Deeply> not sure what you mean, but I'm looking at what i posted
[14:29:59] <misterm> Deeply: you can't just change document.getElementById('submitbutton').click(); and expect it to work
[14:30:12] <misterm> Deeply: you also have to change  the handler
[14:30:44] <misterm> $("#submitbutton").click(function(){ showFormData(this.form) })
[14:30:52] <misterm> see, the one binds the event and the other fires it
[14:31:58] <Deeply> hang on, listening to my output
[14:32:33] <Deeply> that's in the barcode changeroutine that document.getElementByID('submitbutton').click();
[14:32:58] <misterm> note that this.form will be different in jQuery than vanilla JS as well
[14:34:25] <Deeply> right, i'm calling showformdata from the hidden button on the form
[14:34:40] <donaldpcook> LSshock, you're removing the bPlay class in that handler
[14:34:44] <misterm> well what I mean is in vanilla JS, in the click handler "this" will be different
[14:35:00] <misterm> in jQuery event handlers are applied to the relevent element, so "this" refers to the element
[14:35:10] <LSshock> arg
[14:35:14] <LSshock> -___-
[14:35:24] <Deeply> ok so I should just call my barcodechange routine from that button then?
[14:35:45] <misterm> Deeply: I'm not sure what you mean
[14:36:03] <LSshock> donaldpcook: no hm thats not it though its not correct either
[14:36:23] <misterm> Deeply: you'd do whatever you're doing now, just change it to use jQuery

[14:37:46] <ajpiano> i'm working on transitioning the book to the other project

[14:42:26] <LSshock> sean`: impressive, thanks a billion (im so freaking tired)
[14:42:32] <misterm> Deeply: inside your html, inside the tags...you have Javascript code, ideally, the ONLY place you should have JS is inside script tags, or inside a JS file
[14:42:51] <gnarf> ?inline @Deeply
[14:42:52] <bot-t> Deeply, don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[14:43:57] <SEJeff_work> Has anyone who has used jquery ui tabs seen a time when the separate divs for different tabs aren't hiding like they should?
[14:44:02] <TonkaTruck> If I keep using getScript() to pull in fairly simple object literals, will these just pile up in memory?  Is there anything I can do to destroy the object literal?  Also, will the subsequent calls to that script be called or will they be cached?  I'm wondering if I should convert what I have to javascriptmvc or backbone.

[14:48:35] <mixmasterxp> is there a way I can define an object as an ajax object without actually executing the ajax
[14:48:41] <sean`> mixmasterxp, why abort ?
[14:48:47] <sean`> are you doing an autocomplete like tihngy/
[14:48:49] <mixmasterxp> yes
[14:48:56] <sean`> you should debounce
[14:49:04] <mixmasterxp> ok, i'll google that
[14:49:07] <mixmasterxp> jquery debounce right?
[14:49:08] <Deeply> misterm do you mean this?
[14:49:13] <sean`> no, it's a normal term
[14:49:13] <Deeply> onChange="BarCodeTextChange();" onFocus="BarCodeTextChange();" onBlur="BarCodeTextChange();" onkeypress="searchKeyPress(event);
[14:49:19] <sean`> you create a timeout, like 300ms

[15:22:22] <sean`> err.

[15:22:43] <sean`> loop through that, and wrap each element with an <li>, and remove the tags

[15:28:11] <Prot> no need for that, if you're just trying to debug
[15:28:21] <Prot> if you're using chrome, do ctrl shift i
[15:28:27] <Prot> and look at the network tab as ajax happens
[15:28:32] <maxfreeze> sean` thanks, my code was a crap :)
[15:28:59] <Deeply> misterm: http://jsfiddle.net/deeplyshrouded/XGax5/
[15:29:02] <sean`> maxfreeze, some code are ceo's, some code are toilet cleaners
[15:29:07] <sean`> still, their code
[15:29:18] <Prot> ceo code sucks
[15:29:28] <misterm> Deeply: yea, but I mean, what is it you are doing that you are not sure is right or not?
[15:29:45] <Deeply> not sure, just wanted to be sure it looked ok to you
[15:29:46] <Deeply> also
[15:29:56] <misterm> Deeply: theres still js in your HTML and a bunch of stuff in the script needs work
[15:29:56] <Deeply> i see a line and was wondering if it could be changed
[15:30:11] <Deeply> i thought I took all the js out
[15:30:26] <Deeply> looking, maybe i uploaded the wrong file
[15:30:35] <misterm> Deeply: nope, theres still some in the hidden button it looks like
[15:31:02] <opalepatrick> thanks Prot I am using exactly that but being a novice with JavaScript and console was looking in the wrong place
[15:31:14] <Prot> which browser?
[15:31:23] <Prot> i really think chrome is best for dev at this point
[15:31:28] <Prot> i have issues with all the other consoles
[15:31:33] <Deeply> ya i found it
[15:31:33] <Prot> best part is its built in
[15:31:39] <Deeply> ok testing again
[15:32:28] <sipsniffa> what's the best way of setting a value on a html element from server-side code that will then be accessed by jquery code (kind of like passing a values to jquery from the server)?
[15:32:30] <Deeply> ok i took the onclick out and it broke :)
[15:32:52] <misterm> Yea, I love FF, but I use Chrome for dev...the remote debug is sweet
[15:32:54] <opalepatrick> Saying that, I can see the url on action that I am posting to, but not the posts? THat where I start debugging?
[15:33:23] <Prot> sipsniffa: best way is having the javascript handle the gritty details, and the server simply pass it JSON data with an instruction string
[15:33:46] <Prot> like {action:'updateLogin', data{user:... }}
[15:33:54] <jaequery> hello
[15:34:10] <sipsniffa> Prot: thanks, but this isn't an ajax call
[15:34:34] <Prot> then same deal, pass it in a <script> or have an initialize script that checks for data in certain place
[15:34:40] <Deeply> now i have to figure out how i broke it
[15:34:42] <sipsniffa> Prot: i'm outputting a list of elements, each with a click handler
[15:34:46] <Deeply> the barcode scans but nothing else happens
[15:35:07] <Prot> so you just want to pass data to an element?
[15:35:13] <Prot> so the click handler can access it?
[15:35:16] <sipsniffa> yep
[15:35:21] <sipsniffa> you got it!
[15:35:24] <Prot> make an attribute in the element
[15:35:33] <Prot> to stay strict, use 'data-[name]'
[15:35:42] <Prot> data- is the only prefix allowed by some standards
[15:35:44] <sipsniffa> yeah, wondering what attrib to use
[15:35:44] <Deeply> <tr><td colspan="2"><input type="button" class="buttonSubmitHide" id="submitbutton" name="submit" value="Submit Barcode" ></td></table>
[15:35:48] <Prot> and then again put json code in it
[15:35:54] <Prot> and unserialize the json with jquery
[15:36:00] <sipsniffa> ah, ok
[15:36:05] <Deeply> i took out the onclick event there
[15:36:13] <sipsniffa> thanks, Prot
[15:36:17] <Prot> i like to make an onInit attribute
[15:36:29] <Prot> that will always run for any element that has it. not the most efficienty, but definitely clean
[15:36:48] <sipsniffa> could you explain a bit more about the onInit attrib?
[15:37:54] <Prot> does nothing, i just like to put initialization info in some attributes
[15:37:56] <Prot> like
[15:38:15] <Prot> <table data-oninit="setupTable(this);" >....
[15:38:22] <Deeply> hmmmmmm
[15:38:29] <Prot> and then $('table[data-oninit]').each(....
[15:38:31] <sipsniffa> hm, interesting
[15:38:36] <Prot> during initialize
[15:39:06] <Prot> i do it that way to avoid having to use identifiers and messiness. simply any element with oninit will do something on page load
[15:39:27] <Deeply> so misterm, when I have the button as it is now, it's supposed to call that function at the top of the js?
[15:39:35] <sipsniffa> yes, that does look rather nice/clean
[15:39:58] <Prot> the attribute 'oninit' is actually a real attribute used in ie for that purpose
[15:40:06] <Prot> but doesn't work anywhere else. always use data-
[15:40:29] <sipsniffa> thanks for the suggestions
[15:40:45] <Prot> ka-blamo
[15:40:48] <xsamurai> if i have a form with dynamic selects , how do i pass the value for all of those along with a form as hidden fields
[15:41:01] <xsamurai> right when i ask a question the net decides to split
[15:41:09] <Prot> 'all of those' ?
[15:41:19] <Prot> you mean the highlighted values?
[15:41:25] <xsamurai> err all of the dynamically created selects
[15:41:33] <xsamurai> well value for the selects
[15:41:34] <friskd> how can i hide something... have a delay, but not have it animate shut...
[15:41:40] <xsamurai> Prot: yes
[15:41:46] <friskd> i just want it to wait a few seconds before it hides...
[15:42:31] <Prot> good question
[15:42:34] <Prot> i know how the browser does it
[15:42:37] <Prot> but not sure how jquery does it
[15:43:00] <pifantastic> ?delay
[15:43:14] <pifantastic> ?delay @ friskd
[15:43:25] <friskd> o yea. Duh.  tnx pifantastic
[15:43:30] <pifantastic> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[15:43:36] <friskd> just built the coolest little tooltip plugin.
[15:43:42] <friskd> tnx.
[15:44:11] <blindMoe> friskd: gonna share it with the community? ;)
[15:44:21] <friskd> yea. thats the plan.
[15:44:25] <friskd> i'm gonna open source it.
[15:44:51] <Deeply> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155188/trigger-button-click-with-javascript-on-enter-key-in-text-box
[15:45:03] <Deeply> i take it a button needs the onclick event?
[15:45:05] <friskd> super flixible.   working on this last piece which allows for a dynamically positioned arrow... so you know what the tooltip is referring too...
[15:45:15] <Deeply> or did I misunderstand you misterm?
[15:49:07] <Deeply> wow
[15:49:14] <Deeply> I haven't seen a netsplit in years :)
[15:51:49] <Deeply> hmmmm do I really need the button on my form?
[15:52:17] <serio> you don't need anything!
[15:52:45] <Deeply> well i took out the js on the form as misterm said, now the barcode scans into the box but nothing else happens
[15:53:51] <Deeply> lemme try to fix it :|
[15:53:53] <Deeply> heheheheh
[15:55:01] <Deeply> fixed it! :)
[15:55:09] <Deeply> the button isn't needed at all now
[15:55:10] <Deeply> :)
[15:55:40] <Deeply> wow!
[15:55:48] <Deeply> I have to say I'm impressed.
[15:59:04] <pg57> Bonsoir Ã  tous.

[15:59:33] <pg57> Speak you French ?
[16:02:36] <Deeply> yes! it works!

[16:04:08] <RobW> if I have this code:         $("body").click(function() { if($("#pop-email").is(":visible")) { $("#pop-email .btn_close").trigger("click"); } });
[16:04:19] <RobW> how do I disable the trigger if click is within the #pop-email element?
[16:04:46] <pg57> Is there a French jQuery users who spend time on the show ? Thank you.
[16:05:19] <opalepatrick> using chrome console  - I take it that the response headers under Headers in Network should contains the response to my request?
[16:09:14] <RobW> nevermind, used a global var for hover events

[16:26:10] <ericb_> hey, i have a js ?
[16:27:00] <Deeply> o dpm
[16:27:09] <Deeply> I don't know much but I'll try to help
[16:27:42] <ericb_> i've wrapped a radio btn within an a href, and use the href's onclick event to trigger the checked value
[16:28:05] <ericb_> but the radio btn itself is then broken
[16:34:46] <Deeply> and you are using jquery?
[16:35:09] <ericb_> ...actually, it's just a javascript question.
[16:35:15] <ericb_> is there a better channel i should go to?
[16:35:56] <Deeply> I'm not really a javascript programmer, but there is #javascript on efnet, that's the only other channel I know of
[16:36:02] <seus> question: I'm probably doing this wrong, but why is it when I do an ajax load, this isn't reloading the function? is it not possible for the callback function to reload itself? http://jsfiddle.net/XqKdE/
[16:42:53] <fffffuuuuuuu> ok guys major headache here
[16:43:26] <fffffuuuuuuu> i'm trying to figure out exactly how the accordion buttons are called on this site
[16:43:28] <fffffuuuuuuu> http://www.east-manchester.com/
[16:43:41] <fffffuuuuuuu> the ones saying more ways to get connected etc...
[16:44:17] <fffffuuuuuuu> what am i missing here.... there seems to be no obvious javascript that links the button classes to events or whatever?
[16:44:38] <mustefaj> what's the best way to toggle a checkbox?
[16:45:00] <mustefaj> should i manually remove and add the attr after checking if its checked or not?
[16:45:42] <fffffuuuuuuu> dude can you help me
[16:45:52] <Deeply> not sure to be honest
[16:46:14] <fffffuuuuuuu> who you talking to?
[16:46:54] <fffffuuuuuuu> i'm used to working with things like jquery tools etc, so i expect extra code on top of calling the jquery library
[16:47:01] <fffffuuuuuuu> so why are those buttons confusing me
[16:47:11] <mustefaj> what are you talking about?
[16:47:15] <fffffuuuuuuu> http://www.east-manchester.com/
[16:47:26] <fffffuuuuuuu> down on the left column, some accordion buttons
[16:47:43] <fffffuuuuuuu> i have no idea how they work, i'm trying to emulate that kind of thing on my own page
[16:48:00] <mustefaj> do it
[16:48:13] <tonnez> http://pastebin.com/88CwdBA8 ... if i click one of the <li> under ul.subsections it will call base.displayPane() for each <li>, why?
[16:48:22] <mustefaj> you can do slideup and slidedown fffffuuuuuuuu
[16:48:37] <fffffuuuuuuu> ok but how are those buttons calling the slideup etc
[16:48:42] <mustefaj> http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[16:49:01] <mustefaj> when that element is clicked â¦. $(this)
[16:49:11] <mustefaj> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[16:49:17] <fffffuuuuuuu> where in the code does it say that is my question
[16:49:25] <fffffuuuuuuu> i'm trying to find that whole bit of code
[16:49:30] <mustefaj> so you can copy paste?
[16:49:32] <mustefaj> lol
[16:49:35] <mustefaj> that's bad karma maan
[16:49:39] <fffffuuuuuuu> well not exactly
[16:49:43] <fffffuuuuuuu> just figure out the workings
[16:49:49] <mustefaj> are you using firefox?
[16:49:53] <fffffuuuuuuu> yeah firebug
[16:49:57] <fffffuuuuuuu> and i still am having trouble
[16:50:14] <fffffuuuuuuu> i can see the jquery.min.js obviously
[16:50:48] <fffffuuuuuuu> i'm basically trying to search for the button's class in the javascript
[16:51:02] <fffffuuuuuuu> css class
[16:51:10] <fffffuuuuuuu> probably the wrong thing to do, i dunno
[16:51:31] <tonnez> $('.foo').click(function() { $(this).slideUp(); });
[16:51:52] <mustefaj> what tonnez said
[16:52:04] <mustefaj> where .foo = the class
[16:52:36] <fffffuuuuuuu> ok .foo, looking for it
[16:52:41] <fffffuuuuuuu> oh wait.
[16:52:41] <mustefaj> no dude
[16:52:44] <fffffuuuuuuu> i can't find the class man
[16:52:44] <mustefaj> .foo isnt the class
[16:52:46] <fffffuuuuuuu> that's the problem
[16:52:55] <mustefaj> .foo is whatever class you make for the element you want to toggle the slideup on
[16:52:58] <fffffuuuuuuu> accordion-toggler js-accordion-toggler
[16:53:03] <fffffuuuuuuu> those are two css classes on the button
[16:53:07] <tonnez> $('body').click(function() { $(this).slideUp(); });
[16:53:10] <mustefaj> thats mootools man
[16:53:10] <tonnez> :)
[16:53:15] <mustefaj> rofl
[16:53:23] <fffffuuuuuuu> i don't see mootools scripts being called
[16:53:32] <mustefaj> you don't have to use accordion
[16:53:32] <fffffuuuuuuu> that's what i find confusing
[16:53:39] <mustefaj> just do what tonnez said
[16:53:58] <fffffuuuuuuu> alright will have a crack
[16:53:59] <mustefaj> $('.yourclasshere').click(function() { $(this).slideUp(); });
[16:54:53] <fffffuuuuuuu> wait a minute, it's difference
[16:54:55] <fffffuuuuuuu> different
[16:54:59] <fffffuuuuuuu> there are two divs
[16:55:12] <fffffuuuuuuu> when one is clicked, it slides up and the other one goes display:none
[16:55:20] <fffffuuuuuuu> is that all just jquery???
[16:55:24] <mustefaj> yeah
[16:55:26] <mustefaj> should be
[16:55:54] <mustefaj> but it should be on the same div
[16:56:04] <mustefaj> not sure why its two
[16:56:27] <mustefaj> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[16:56:28] <mustefaj> just use that
[16:56:50] <mustefaj> that way you don't need to make it go up and display none, you just toggle it up and down
[16:57:18] <fffffuuuuuuu> alright
[16:57:36] <mustefaj> i think you can even just give it a class with display:none on doc load
[16:57:55] <mustefaj> and when you click the title or "button" it toggleclasses
[16:58:12] <mustefaj> fffffuuuuuuu^^
[16:58:20] <mustefaj> now if only someone can tell me: is there a toggleCheckBox
[16:59:39] <z1000> http://pastie.org/1895092
[17:00:01] <z1000> what is the best way for instead of .more ... I want next .more but tried few diff things didnt work, any suggestions?
[17:00:44] <z1000> so its a sibling of the parent? hmm
[17:00:49] <tonnez> next .more ?
[17:00:54] <advorak> heya - I am trying to find //a[href] , where the href contains "pdf" ... Google is proving to not be of much help for me right now :-) Any clues?
[17:01:02] <z1000> I did that... didnt work
[17:01:22] <tonnez> what do you mean by next more?
[17:02:12] <advorak> $("//a[href*='pdf']") :-)
[17:02:14] <z1000> 			$(this).next().find('.more').slideDown(600);
[17:02:14] <advorak> thanks! found it!
[17:02:18] <z1000> is that incorrect ?
[17:02:35] <z1000> yes next() .more
[17:03:47] <z1000> this worked 			$(this).parent().next('.more').slideDown(600);
[17:03:54] <advorak> is there an easy way to do $("//a[href*='pdf']") with a regular expression -- say, /^.*\.pdf$/ ?
[17:04:30] <z1000> 			$(this).parent().next('.more').slideDown(600); is that optimized syntax ?
[17:05:00] <tonnez> z1000: instead of using parent().next('.more') use closest()
[17:05:14] <tonnez> closest('.more')
[17:05:29] <specto> next already IS next() to your button (if i read that code right)
[17:05:30] <z1000> doesnt work
[17:06:08] <derektumolo> im trying to trigger a jquery ui dialog from within a jquery-tmpl area, and it doesnt seem to be able to find the div, so the div is visible on page load, and clicking my dialog button doesnt work.  how do i make them play nice?
[17:06:38] <specto>  * '.more' already IS next() to your button (if i read that code right)
[17:06:43] <z1000> its not though
[17:06:46] <z1000> they are not siblings
[17:07:16] <z1000> does closest move fwd in the code or only backward?
[17:07:19] <specto> uh, yeah... that <p> is the sibling
[17:07:34] <z1000> yea so the parent of more is a sibling
[17:07:39] <z1000> more-btn rather
[17:08:25] <specto> doesn't $(this).parent().next() work for you?
[17:08:34] <z1000> 			$(this).parent().next('.more').slideDown(600);
[17:08:35] <z1000> yes
[17:08:44] <z1000> that works but 			$(this).closest('.more').slideDown(600);
[17:08:47] <z1000> does not
[17:08:49] <tonnez> z1000: http://jsfiddle.net/wGx7S/
[17:09:09] <z1000> ya that works fine... the thing is I have multiple instances :P
[17:09:15] <z1000> to be triggered independently
[17:10:17] <z1000> .parent().next('.more') worked... just weird .closest() didnt
[17:11:56] <specto> what if you took that p containtainer and add the click handling to it, so next() will be that .more (would make things easier, wouldnt it)
[17:12:09] <z1000> no cause only the button is clickable
[17:12:27] <z1000> you can see it working here: http://p7dev.com/equity/the-team
[17:12:31] <z1000> click More >>
[17:13:08] <tonnez> z1000 one sec
[17:24:51] <seus> question: I'm probably doing this wrong, but why is it when I do an ajax load, this isn't reloading the function? is it not possible for the callback function to reload itself? http://jsfiddle.net/XqKdE/
[17:27:47] <gnarf> seus: can you reduce the problem?
[17:27:57] <seus> to what?
[17:28:17] <gnarf> i think i might have a pattern that might help you solve this...
[17:28:21] <seus> i want the callback function to fire that function everytime it loads a new ajax page
[17:28:33] <gnarf> seus: make a plugin
[17:28:45] <seus> so that it "connects" to those id tags everytime
[17:38:56] <tonnez> z1000: http://jsfiddle.net/bsyNx/ meh sloppy and unfinished but you get the point
[17:39:23] <gnarf> seus: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/yGGyv/
[17:39:33] <tonnez> wait no
[17:39:39] <tonnez> very broken
[17:39:43] <tonnez> ignore it
[17:41:03] <seus> i gotta put my son to bed...i'll check out your function in a second gnarf and get back to you shortly
[17:41:15] <tonnez> z1000: there thats a little better: http://jsfiddle.net/bsyNx/2/
[17:41:16] <gnarf> seus: i might not be around to explain it
[17:42:14] <seus> ok, well i'll see if i can figure it out...
[17:42:22] <seus> if anything i'll step through it
[17:49:08] <Deeply> how can I step through my javascript?
[17:50:43] <ericb_> deeply, what are you using to debug?
[17:50:58] <Deeply> i have something called firebug but I never used it before
[17:51:12] <systemfault> Learn it.
[17:51:15] <coldhead> watch some screencasts, Deeply, they'll get you running pretty quick
[17:51:15] <ericb_> yup.
[17:51:22] <Deeply> ok
[17:51:28] <Deeply> systemfault, it's working :)
[17:51:35] <systemfault> :D
[17:51:57] <Deeply> now i'm trying to get it to work with another login form
[17:52:00] <ericb_> basically, you can open firebug, click on Script tab, and then you should have access to any javascript on your page.
[17:52:07] <Deeply> that's why i wanted to step through the javascript
[17:52:08] <Deeply> okie
[17:52:09] <ericb_> you can insert breakpoints in your code
[17:53:29] <Deeply> ok looking
[17:53:37] <Deeply> it says script panel was inactive
[17:53:40] <superjacaman> console.log() is allway useful
[17:53:43] <Deeply> trying ot get it active now
[17:57:21] <Whirl3d> Good Evening Rockstars.
[17:58:03] <Deeply> hi
[17:58:23] <Deeply> systemfault, it works with my form, now trying to get it to work with another form.
[17:59:15] <Deeply> oForm.elements[2].value = null;
[17:59:36] <Deeply> instead of that can i go formid.elementid.value?
[18:00:08] <Deeply> er
[18:00:15] <Deeply> formid.elementid = value;
[18:01:49] <alexparker> so for really heavy dom magical web apps, is it better to write your own junk with prototype?
[18:02:26] <Whirl3d> * gasp *
[18:02:38] <coldhead> prototype is the right answer IN THE 1980s
[18:08:00] <ericb_> finally figured it out
[18:08:53] <ericb_> fyi, for mobile styling, you can wrap radio buttons into a href tags and make them look like button bars and all...
[18:09:21] <ericb_> but if the radio btn is inside an a href and you tie an onclick event to the a href to trigger the checked value of the radio btn,
[18:09:58] <ericb_> you need to utilize ontouchstart instead of onclick in the a href so the radio btn's click doesn't get confused with the overriding a href onclick
[18:10:15] <ericb_> probably nobody cares, i
[18:10:24] <ericb_> am just glad i finally figured itout
[18:23:04] <Deeply> heheheheh
[18:27:06] <Deeply> instead of accessing a form via a loop, how can i access an element directly?
[18:27:07] <vrtigo1> quick question, are the animation methods Deferred objects?
[18:27:08] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:27:18] <lenswipe> can someone tell me something..
[18:27:23] <vrtigo1> or derived from Deferred objects?
[18:27:23] <Whirl3d> can you namespace functions?
[18:27:36] <lenswipe> $('#news').load("http://www.google.com"); should load http://www.google.com and display it in #news - correct?
[18:27:55] <coldhead> ?sop @ lenswipe
[18:27:55] <bot-t> lenswipe, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[18:28:09] <lenswipe> coldhead i dont understand....
[18:28:21] <coldhead> your code would work if you were hosting it on google.com
[18:28:26] <lenswipe> ah i see
[18:28:36] <coldhead> but for anyotherdomain.com it won't
[18:28:39] <lenswipe> right
[18:28:45] <lenswipe> is that to prevent XSS?
[18:28:50] <coldhead> well spotted!
[18:28:59] <ch3mical> lenswipe: Google provides a search API for such things
[18:29:08] <ch3mical> As well as many other useful APIs
[18:29:10] <lenswipe> thats not what im trying to do
[18:29:12] <lenswipe> :p
[18:29:17] <lenswipe> i was using google.com as a test
[18:29:22] <coldhead> i think google is just an example
[18:29:26] <lenswipe> yeah
[18:29:27] <coldhead> it's meant to be about #news, i bet
[18:29:35] <lenswipe> yes it is
[18:29:43] <lenswipe> my real intention is to reload a div from another place on my site
[18:29:46] <ch3mical> Pfft... reading stuff
[18:29:48] <lenswipe> wonder if you could help out with that
[18:29:53] <lenswipe> mind if i pastebin what i have so far?
[18:30:05] <lenswipe> ch3mical http://openpaste.org/27585/inline/
[18:30:31] <ch3mical> lenswipe: if this is all on your site, why not just store data in a database or XML or even a JSON file?
[18:30:38] <lenswipe> that code sort of works, in that if i do alert(msg) straight after $('#news')etc etc it displays what its supposed to
[18:30:48] <lenswipe> because its dynamic data
[18:31:05] <lenswipe> and its not stuff i can store in a database
[18:31:07] <ch3mical> All of those examples are designed to store dynamic data
[18:31:11] <lenswipe> its gonna be external RSS feeds
[18:31:24] <lenswipe> i cant store those in a database
[18:31:30] <ch3mical> You can store RSS in a database
[18:31:32] <lenswipe> well i can but it would be hude
[18:31:35] <lenswipe> huge*
[18:31:46] <ch3mical> Databases are designed to handle "huge"
[18:31:46] <coldhead> that's what she said
[18:31:47] <lenswipe> im making an rss aggregator for the public
[18:32:03] <lenswipe> ch3mical asin the overhead would be absolutely MASSIVE
[18:32:07] <ch3mical> It's been done ;p
[18:32:11] <lenswipe> yeah
[18:32:14] <lenswipe> by google or facebook
[18:32:23] <lenswipe> not be someone with a shitty little $5 VPS
[18:32:24] <ch3mical> lenswipe: Google and about 20000 other companies do it with no problem
[18:32:32] <lenswipe> ch3mical see above
[18:32:42] <coldhead> i think google has a delxue $7 VPS
[18:32:44] <ch3mical> Get a better server?
[18:33:03] <lenswipe> either way, even if i was store it in a DB i would still have to output it somewhere
[18:33:24] <coldhead> lenswipe: can you paste the actual generated JS, after PHP has had its way with it?
[18:33:25] <ch3mical> Trust me, if the data is too big for a database, it will be MUCH too big to try to load with AJAX straight from the source
[18:33:31] <lenswipe> sure
[18:33:35] <lenswipe> coldhead gladly
[18:33:42] <ch3mical> The browser will just run out of memory
[18:35:48] <Whirl3d> if I define a function inside another function, the internal function has access to the local variables defined in the outer function, right?
[18:35:56] <lenswipe> coldhead http://pastebin.com/zE5YYwBm
[18:36:32] <lenswipe> ch3mical i dont mean this exact peice of data is too big, i mean that this is going to be a public site, and storing the RSS feeds of every user is not an option.
[18:37:35] <ch3mical> It just seems like a waste of time, because then every time every user accesses any feed it's going to pull the feed... that's going to generate a lot of bandwidth
[18:38:21] <ch3mical> Plus it will be very slow T_T
[18:39:39] <coldhead> lenswipe: are you accessing this code via localhost or file:/// ?
[18:39:50] <lenswipe> coldhead localhost of course
[18:39:52] <lenswipe> why?
[18:40:01] <coldhead> cool so SOP won't fuck you up
[18:40:06] <lenswipe> SOP?
[18:40:09] <lenswipe> oh right
[18:40:09] <lenswipe> no
[18:40:28] <coldhead> what about if you just run line 8 from the console in firebu?
[18:40:35] <coldhead> firebug* or your local equivalent
[18:43:01] <lenswipe> i use chrome debug thing
[18:43:36] <coldhead> that's fine
[18:43:42] <coldhead> try its console
[18:44:15] <lenswipe> ok
[18:44:32] <lenswipe> ch3mical im using the simple pie js library - it caches
[18:44:49] <ch3mical> You should also turn on XMLHttpRequest Logging
[18:44:55] <Deeply> script panel was inactive
[18:44:58] <Deeply> how do i turn that on?
[18:45:12] <coldhead> right click and look for the relevant option
[18:45:13] <ch3mical> Deeply: that was for lenswipe
[18:45:16] <coldhead> right click in the console
[18:45:23] <lenswipe> coldhead it works btw if i run that
[18:45:24] <lenswipe> :D
[18:45:26] <coldhead> everyone should turn on XHR logging :)
[18:45:32] <ch3mical> coldhead: inded
[18:45:34] <ch3mical> +e
[18:45:38] <coldhead> OKAY so the load bit is fine
[18:45:55] <lenswipe> yep
[18:46:00] <coldhead> it must be the success handler not firing
[18:46:00] <lenswipe> coldhead well sort of
[18:46:07] <coldhead> for some reason
[18:46:07] <coldhead> oh?
[18:46:10] <lenswipe> coldhead the load doesnt fire when i click the checkbox
[18:46:18] <lenswipe> so yeah it could be some kind of event handler not firing
[18:46:41] <lenswipe> coldhead although whats strange is if i put a js alert after the load it fires
[18:46:42] <coldhead> okay we need to jsfiddle this
[18:46:47] <lenswipe> ok
[18:50:48] <coldhead> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/QnR6U/
[18:50:51] <coldhead> that works for me
[18:51:00] <coldhead> if you click the button it loads robots.txt into the #news div
[18:51:13] <coldhead> so i think that means your JS is fine
[18:51:28] <coldhead> something might be fucked with your POST request
[18:51:45] <Deeply> 'k
[18:52:09] <Deeply> msg += oForm.elements[i].value + "\n"; <-how to do it with a loop....got that working.
[18:52:10] <Deeply> msg += oform.elements.userid.value + "\n"; is this how to do so directly?
[18:52:35] <lenswipe> coldhead that works for me too
[18:53:29] <coldhead> lenswipe: can you see the post() in the chrome console and does it say 200 OK or similar?
[18:53:45] <coldhead> i believe it needs to get a 200 to fire the success handler
[18:53:50] <coldhead> 500 won't do it
[18:54:06] <lenswipe> isnt 500 internal server error?
[18:54:10] <coldhead> yes
[18:54:25] <coldhead> you want the opposite of that
[18:54:44] <coldhead> 200 OK: internal server awesome
[18:55:19] <lenswipe> ok lemme try
[18:55:22] <coldhead> lenswipe: any chance you can get your localhost online?
[18:55:29] <lenswipe> coldhead sure
[18:55:33] <lenswipe> lemme go find my public IP
[18:55:43] <coldhead> good luck
[18:55:48] <lenswipe> coldhead 95.146.94.17/readr
[18:56:01] <lenswipe> lemme get u an accouint
[18:56:18] <lenswipe> coldhead username: test
[18:59:08] <coldhead> i'm gettin a not authenticated error signing in
[18:59:17] <coldhead> sure looks nice though
[18:59:27] <lenswipe> dammit really?
[18:59:31] <lenswipe> try again
[18:59:33] <lenswipe> it should work now
[19:00:12] <lenswipe> coldhead it should work now
[19:01:23] <coldhead> what password am i using?
[19:01:27] <coldhead> test/test isn't it
[19:02:10] <lenswipe> no
[19:02:12] <lenswipe> test/abc
[19:02:15] <coldhead> ah
[19:02:17] <lenswipe> :)
[19:02:30] <coldhead> you didn't mention that vital thing
[19:03:12] <lenswipe> i did
[19:03:14] <lenswipe> i sent you a notice
[19:03:17] <lenswipe> <lenswipe> coldhead username: test
[19:03:17] <lenswipe> >coldhead< password: abc
[19:03:29] <coldhead> hmm i didn't get that
[19:03:33] <lenswipe> meh
[19:03:49] <coldhead> NEVER MIND
[19:04:02] <lenswipe> nded
[19:04:05] <lenswipe> indeed*
[19:04:26] <coldhead> now where do i click?
[19:04:37] <lenswipe> add a feed to your account in "Manage feeds"
[19:04:43] <lenswipe> news.bbc.co.uk should do the job
[19:04:54] <lenswipe> and then go into "Feed" and click "Settings" and then click the checkbox
[19:07:37] <coldhead> just as i suspected
[19:07:42] <coldhead> 500 internal server error
[19:08:02] <coldhead> http://95.146.94.17/readr/ajax/feedchecks.html
[19:08:06] <coldhead> so much error goodness
[19:08:31] <coldhead> fix that and all shall be well
[19:08:40] <coldhead> jsfiddle proved it
[19:09:59] <lenswipe> right thanks
[19:12:16] <superjacaman> hi guys
[19:12:36] <superjacaman> i'm have a problem with $.post
[19:12:37] <lenswipe> coldhead bear in mind though, those errors are appearing becuase there is no post data
[19:13:06] <coldhead> they also appear when i click the checkbox and do the post() request
[19:14:15] <lenswipe> coldhead meaning?
[19:14:23] <coldhead> beg your pardon, there's a different 500 error "The action you have requested is not allowed."
[19:14:33] <lenswipe> oh i see...
[19:14:47] <lenswipe> that would seem to be the XSS protection kicking in....
[19:15:10] <coldhead> as long as that's a 500 error jquery isn't going to  run your success handler
[19:15:22] <lenswipe> ah
[19:15:57] <lenswipe> coldhead is it possible to post multiple things with jquery?
[19:16:22] <coldhead> i can think of several interprations of that question and the answer to all of them is yes
[19:16:36] <lenswipe> i want to post the hidden XSS protection input
[19:16:49] <coldhead> you can have .post() and .post() and .post()
[19:17:15] <coldhead> and you can have .post('someurl', {foo: 'bar', lol: 'aids'})
[19:18:16] <lenswipe> so is it 1 $.post per feild?
[19:18:24] <coldhead> no
[19:19:09] <lenswipe> coldhead my csrf protection field is called: ci_csrf_token
[19:19:15] <lenswipe> how would i have that post too?
[19:19:16] <coldhead>  .post('someurl', {foo: 'bar', lol: $('#fieldid').val(), boobs: $('#someother').val()})
[19:19:23] <lenswipe> ok
[19:19:37] <lenswipe> problem is i cant set an ID on the csrf field...
[19:19:58] <coldhead> {ci_csrf_token: $('input[name=ci_csrf_token]').val(), ...}
[19:20:48] <lenswipe> http://openpaste.org/27587/inline/
[19:21:01] <lenswipe> thats my post() line, where does that fit in with that?
[19:21:22] <munderwo> Hi all. I've got a way of rendering a DOM element or not depending on some condition. What I want to do is if that element is loaded, trigger a javascript function.. Is there a way to do this?
[19:23:56] <coldhead> fuck openpaste >: |
[19:24:21] <lenswipe> ?
[19:24:25] <coldhead> lenswipe: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/387902/
[19:24:28] <coldhead> something like that
[19:24:38] <coldhead> openpaste just error 500ed at me >: |
[19:24:39] <lenswipe> i only use openpaste because it integrates with netbeans
[19:24:47] <lenswipe> lmao
[19:24:52] <lenswipe> maybe they're having csrf problems
[19:25:01] <coldhead> maybe you are cursed, lenswipe
[19:25:08] <lenswipe> it seems that way....
[19:25:09] <coldhead> can you keep plants or small animals alive?
[19:25:29] <lenswipe> my rabbits died a number of years ago, and the spider plant behind me doesnt look great
[19:26:02] <lenswipe> by the way....the "message" asin (message:msg)...does that mean that i retrieve the value of msg using $_POST['message'] ?
[19:26:33] <coldhead> yup
[19:26:38] <lenswipe> cool
[19:26:47] <coldhead> read the docs but that's basically how the stuff in the {} works
[19:27:00] <lenswipe> ok thats it sort of working :p
[19:27:18] <coldhead> {name: 'value'} => $_POST['name'] == 'value'
[19:27:22] <lenswipe> im still getting errors but its only bitching about array_intersect which i can deal with
[19:27:25] <lenswipe> :)
[19:27:36] <coldhead> that is definitely a matter for yourself :)
[19:27:52] <coldhead> i need to go take some pills for my anxiety, good luck lenswipe
[19:27:59] <coldhead> sorry about the curse and all
[19:28:00] <lenswipe> thanks
[19:28:05] <lenswipe> i need to go take some pills for my code
[19:32:19] <superjacaman> hey boys
[19:33:09] <superjacaman> i'm having a strange issue with $.post
[19:33:30] <coldhead> some of us are girls, jerk
[19:33:39] <superjacaman> sorry
[19:34:04] <coldhead> what is your post trouble/
[19:34:14] <superjacaman> getting a error 500
[19:34:17] <superjacaman> =[
[19:34:31] <coldhead> that is happening on the server side
[19:34:37] <coldhead> it's not jQuery
[19:34:54] <coldhead> do you know what is causing it?
[19:35:11] <superjacaman> no i can access via browser normally
[19:35:24] <superjacaman> don't know why the 500 thing
[19:35:30] <coldhead> is it online?
[19:35:40] <coldhead> maybe it doesn't liek the data you are posting to it?
[19:36:25] <superjacaman> yeah
[19:36:57] <coldhead> you should be able to see what is being returned in the firebug console
[19:37:00] <coldhead> or chrome console
[19:37:01] <lenswipe> coldhead still got a strang qurk, i think its to do with my ,val
[19:37:06] <coldhead> if you have XHR logging enabled
[19:37:13] <lenswipe> coldhead is it possible to get the value of several checkboxes?
[19:37:24] <coldhead> ?serialize @ lenswipe
[19:37:24] <bot-t> lenswipe, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:37:30] <lenswipe> coldhead wut?
[19:37:32] <lenswipe> hmm
[19:37:36] <coldhead> you probably want to use that if you have several elements
[19:37:43] <coldhead> check the docs and the examples
[19:37:49] <coldhead> it's pretty simple
[19:37:57] <lenswipe> coldhead FYI: http://openpaste.org/27588/inline/
[19:37:59] <lenswipe> ok
[19:38:01] <lenswipe> ill go look
[19:38:10] <superjacaman> the console don't show much
[19:38:11] <lenswipe> before i do - am i doing the rest of that stuff right?
[19:38:45] <coldhead> superjacaman: if you click on the URL in the console it will usually show you the data received from the server
[19:38:48] <superjacaman> checking my htaccess
[19:39:25] <superjacaman> yeah but the post don't access my page with the action
[19:39:44] <coldhead> lenswipe: $('input[name=ci_csrf_token]').val()
[19:39:51] <coldhead> try that at the chrome console
[19:39:54] <lenswipe> ok
[19:39:55] <coldhead> make sure it find what you expect
[19:40:09] <superjacaman> codification issue i think
[19:40:55] <lenswipe> coldhead yeah thats fine - it lets me submit the form, its just when the form is submitted PHP complains about array_intersect() parameter 2 not being an array(turns out its a boolean - False)
[19:41:00] <ch3mical> Fuck, I hate dataTables
[19:41:19] <superjacaman> coldhead: codification
[19:41:35] <coldhead> maybe ask in ##php, lenswipe, where happily you will not find me
[19:41:47] <coldhead> on account of i am banned
[19:42:01] <lenswipe> ouch
[19:42:02] <lenswipe> why?
[19:42:23] <coldhead> for my controversial views on the the holocaust and 9/11
[19:42:35] <coldhead> which basically i am saying PHP is worse than
[19:42:50] <lenswipe> lmao
[19:43:00] <lenswipe> whats your problem with PHP?
[19:43:06] <lenswipe> is it the lack of structure and stuff?
[19:43:06] <superjacaman> coldhead:  don't like server side things?
[19:43:23] <coldhead> PHP only just got anonymous functions and closures
[19:43:24] <lenswipe> superjacaman he probly prefers Django or Rails
[19:43:31] <coldhead> it's very barbaric
[19:43:38] <lenswipe> hmm
[19:43:38] <coldhead> also the library inconsistencies etc
[19:43:41] <superjacaman> maybe
[19:43:48] <lenswipe> coldhead ever give CodeIgniter a try?
[19:43:51] <superjacaman> php is awesome =]
[19:43:52] <lenswipe> its quite a nice way to use PHP
[19:43:55] <TomWork> hey, lets say I copied a div with clone(), how can I navigate into the div to change the name of an input for instance ?
[19:43:59] <coldhead> codeigniter makes it suck less, sure
[19:44:08] <coldhead> but it can't make it a joy
[19:44:12] <lenswipe> no
[19:44:15] <lenswipe> but it makes it better :)
[19:44:16] <coldhead> and that's what i am after now
[19:44:27] <coldhead> anyway its a matter for yourself
[19:44:28] <lenswipe> im using codeigniter because i dont have time to learn another language at present :p
[19:44:29] <coldhead> you do whatever works for you
[19:44:30] <lenswipe> indeed
[19:44:35] <coldhead> and i will pray for your immortal soul
[19:44:46] <lenswipe> just out of interest, what is your server side language of choice?
[19:44:54] <lenswipe> Java? Python? Ruby?
[19:45:00] <lenswipe> ColdFusion?
[19:45:05] <lenswipe> ASP?
[19:45:06] <coldhead> i like ruby most of those guys
[19:45:09] <lenswipe> ah
[19:45:15] <lenswipe> i was hoping you wouldnt say ASP
[19:45:16] <coldhead> but i'm not a fanatic
[19:45:18] <lenswipe> or CF
[19:45:31] <coldhead> i've used all of those except ASP
[19:45:46] <coldhead> you know you're supposed to learn a new language every year, right?
[19:45:51] <coldhead> better make time!
[19:46:34] <bgranger> Any estimate of the timescale for jquery ui 1.9?
[19:46:46] <coldhead> ajpiano: ^^?
[19:47:06] <ajpiano> dog years
[19:47:18] <coldhead> damn
[19:47:37] <lenswipe> coldhead is var feedID = $('.feed').serialize(); the correct syntax?
[19:47:51] <bgranger> how many dog years?
[19:47:58] <ajpiano> about 11 or 2
[19:48:01] <ajpiano> 1 or 2
[19:48:10] <lenswipe> bgranger new language every 20 years
[19:51:45] <coldhead> i think that;s okay but try it and see, lenswipe
[19:51:49] <coldhead> these pills are kicking in, sorry
[19:51:53] <coldhead> everything is getting fuzzy
[19:52:17] <coldhead> and non-threatening
[19:55:10] <lenswipe> coldhead can i have some?
[20:03:31] <Deeply> heh
[20:03:33] <Deeply> :)
[20:04:03] <ch3mical> Has anyone ever used the dataTables plugin?
[20:04:08] <Deeply> i miss b-trees
[20:05:03] <ch3mical> It's a POS T_T
[20:10:26] <Deeply>       $('[name=userid]').val(txt.substring(0, idx));
[20:10:34] <Deeply> that works, but is it the correct way to do it
[20:22:19] <lenswipe> coldhead Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'serialze'
[20:22:21] <lenswipe> any ideas?
[20:24:05] <ajpiano> lenswipe: the word "serialize" has an i before the z
[20:24:11] <lenswipe> ah.
[20:24:51] <lenswipe> ajpiano so now i have what i presume to be a json array - correct?
[20:25:17] <ajpiano> i don't know what yo'ure doing, i just looked at only that line of text
[20:25:31] <lenswipe> does serialize() produce a json array?
[20:25:41] <ajpiano> no
[20:25:46] <ajpiano> it produces a querystring
[20:26:09] <progrock> so, just found out that jQuery selector's in chrome (havent tested otehrs yet) perform soemthing liek 25% better with an html5 doctype, as opposed to an xhtml
[20:27:02] <lenswipe> right....so how do i send that to my controller?
[20:27:29] <ajpiano> i don't know
[20:27:37] <ajpiano> it's your controller
[20:27:43] <ajpiano> can it parse a standard querystring?
[20:27:52] <lenswipe> i have no idea
[20:27:58] <lenswipe> its a PHP controller
[20:27:59] <ajpiano> well that makes two of us
[20:28:19] <lenswipe> ajpiano http://openpaste.org/27590/inline/
[20:28:43] <ajpiano> this doesn't help me at all
[20:29:25] <progrock> what do you guys use for performance testing?.. I've been messing around with JSLitmus.. seems pretty legit
[20:30:02] <lenswipe> ajpiano do you know PHP?
[20:30:07] <ajpiano> nope
[20:30:20] <ajpiano> i mean i've dabbled
[20:30:27] <lenswipe> right...
[20:30:33] <ajpiano> and i know that php like, does normal ?foo=bar&baz=bat shit
[20:30:36] <ajpiano> if that's what you're trying to do
[20:30:44] <ajpiano> or if you just don't bother seralizing
[20:30:50] <ajpiano> and let jquery send a data object
[20:30:56] <ajpiano> it should "just work"
[20:31:50] <ajpiano> also this is #jquery, we send the data to whereever, we don't care about what your server's doin
[20:35:42] <no-gooder> how can i access dom element's value which has stored in string ?
[20:38:12] <lenswipe> ajpiano what im trying to figure out is what serialize() produces?
[20:38:15] <lenswipe> is it a JSON object?
[20:38:31] <ajpiano> a string
[20:38:42] <ajpiano> you legitimately have no idea what a query string is?
[20:39:00] <ajpiano> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string
[20:40:36] <lenswipe> i know what a query string is
[20:40:41] <lenswipe> it just looks alot like JSON
[20:42:23] <diegoviola> hi
[20:43:24] <diegoviola> i have a <select> element with a few <option>, is there a way to trigger an ajax call whenever i pick a different option? if so, how please?
[20:47:11] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[21:02:38] <letterpress> diegoviola: $("#idOfSelectElement").bind("change",function() { $.ajax({ ... }); });
[21:15:26] <boxbeatsy> hi, how do i bind a click event to an element that has a specific class that is visible when there are many elements with that same class name (but only one of which is visible)?
[21:16:17] <ryanseddon> $(".class:visible").click()
[21:16:18] <boxbeatsy> actually, i guess an easier way to fix my problem is: how do i select an element that has a specific class name that is within a div with a specific id?
[21:16:25] <boxbeatsy> ooo cool, perfect
[21:16:25] <boxbeatsy> thanks
[21:16:45] <Cork> no that won't most likly work
[21:17:20] <Cork> boxbeatsy: you most likly want live or delegate, as i guess what your looking for is for it to work as the classes change
[21:17:21] <lenswipe> any dab jquery hands in her?
[21:17:25] <lenswipe> im having SERIOUS issues
[21:17:38] <Cork> ?ask
[21:17:38] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:17:47] <ryanseddon> yeah Cork would be right
[21:18:15] <lenswipe> Cork http://openpaste.org/27592/inline/ im trying to get a lod of checkboxes (each with the class "feed") and having the value of an integer, to post in some meaningfull form to a PHP controller: http://openpaste.org/27592/inline/
[21:18:18] <lenswipe> Cork any ideas?
[21:18:48] <Cork> lenswipe: make them arrays
[21:18:57] <lenswipe> Cork how?
[21:19:25] <lenswipe> Cork if you mean by doing name="id[]" then i already did it
[21:19:36] <boxbeatsy> Cork: ooo, does live do the same thing as click except also rebinds if you copy the html somewhere else with js?
[21:19:37] <Cork> ok?
[21:19:50] <lenswipe> Cork however when i print out $_POST i get an empty array
[21:20:11] <Cork> boxbeatsy: live and delegate binds another element then the one your looking for, and then try to match the event bubbling up from the intended element
[21:20:29] <Deeply> night :)
[21:20:34] <Cork> boxbeatsy: this results in it not depending on the element matching when you bind, and will work as the dom changes
[21:21:07] <boxbeatsy> Cork: interesting, will look linto it more.  thank you!
[21:21:53] <Cork> lenswipe: could you give it a go, and paste your code for it?
[21:22:09] <lenswipe> give what a go?
[21:22:15] <Cork> lenswipe: and preferable jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com so the code can be updated
[21:22:30] <lenswipe> give what a go?
[21:22:40] <Cork> using [] names
[21:22:45] <lenswipe> ok
[21:23:10] <Cork> lenswipe: when you paste at jsfiddle, please include the form part of the html
[21:24:29] <lenswipe> Cork heres something
[21:24:30] <lenswipe> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/wKV52/
[21:24:48] <lenswipe> its quite hard to jsfiddleise it because its supposed to post to a different page, but you get the idea
[21:25:01] <Cork> k one min
[21:25:45] <Cork> you want to post all the fields or just the one clicked?
[21:26:44] <Cork> lenswipe: ^
[21:27:10] <lenswipe> just the clicked ones
[21:27:46] <Cork> ah, that makes the name completly none vital :)
[21:28:06] <fr0stbyte> are there any jquery ui themes similar to cocoa?
[21:28:29] <dr0id> Hi All.!!!!!!!
[21:29:23] <Cork> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/wKV52/1/ should give you what your after then
[21:30:15] <lenswipe> um
[21:30:23] <lenswipe> Cork you realise that $('input[name=ci_csrf_token]') isnt a checkbox right?
[21:30:42] <Cork> yes
[21:30:54] <lenswipe> ok
[21:31:04] <Cork> but i suspect you want the data on the same post?
[21:32:13] <lenswipe> yep
[21:32:20] <lenswipe> Cork what format will that post the checkboxes in?
[21:32:57] <Cork> lenswipe: it will post the value from the checkbox, but i remembered one more thing to verrify, so i might come with an update in a few secs :)
[21:33:07] <lenswipe> uh...
[21:33:14] <lenswipe> Cork theres more than one checkbox...
[21:34:00] <Cork> lenswipe: ya but $(this) is always the checkbox you click
[21:34:08] <Cork> and you said you only want the one that was changed
[21:34:17] <lenswipe> no i said only the ones that were checked
[21:34:21] <lenswipe> not at all the same thing
[21:34:26] <Cork> ok
[21:34:37] <Cork> then back to the first plan :)
[21:36:09] <Cork> lenswipe: there you go http://jsfiddle.net/wKV52/2/
[21:36:54] <Cork> lenswipe: if your not interested in supporting plain html post you don't need the [] in the name
[21:37:09] <Cork> but it is needed if you want to support that fallback
[21:37:34] <lenswipe> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 's'
[21:37:58] <Cork> lenswipe: thats your code not mine, line 4
[21:38:05] <lenswipe> i think it means  var feedID = $('.feed').s();
[21:38:12] <lenswipe> should that be "serialize" ?
[21:38:37] <Cork> donno thats what you pasted
[21:39:11] <lenswipe> i did?
[21:39:13] <lenswipe> hmm
[21:39:15] <Cork> ya
[21:39:32] <Cork> what i used is on line 9
[21:39:41] <Cork> thats all i added
[21:39:55] <lenswipe> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'val'
[21:39:56] <lenswipe> hmm
[21:40:21] <Cork> where?
[21:40:53] <lenswipe> it wont say
[21:41:17] <lenswipe> im guesing its checked: $.map($('input[name=feed\[\]]:checked'), function(elm) { return elm.val(); })
[21:43:56] <Cork> lenswipe: interesting looks like something changed in 1.6 (i haven't updated the code i normally use yet)
[21:44:05] <Cork> just wrap elm with $() and it should work
[21:44:34] <Cork> that is $.map($('input[name=feed\[\]]:checked'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val() })
[21:45:40] <lenswipe> im using v1.3.2
[21:46:04] <lenswipe> ill try 1,6
[21:46:25] <Cork> lots change in 1.6 so tha might actually break your site
[21:47:51] <lenswipe> it does
[21:48:56] <lenswipe> uh oh
[21:49:00] <lenswipe> no its fine
[21:49:16] <lenswipe> cowhat format do thse ints post as?
[21:49:30] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[21:49:31] <Cork> strings
[21:49:31] <lenswipe> is it a json array?
[21:49:34] <lenswipe> o
[21:49:41] <lenswipe> how do i get em?
[21:50:04] <Cork> $_POST['feed'][x]
[21:50:08] <Cork> opps
[21:50:14] <Cork> no i added it to checked
[21:50:21] <Cork> if you want it in feed use it htere
[21:50:23] <Cork> *there
[21:50:31] <lenswipe> so just $_POST['feed']
[21:50:41] <Cork> no $_POST['checked']
[21:50:45] <lenswipe> ok
[21:50:47] <Cork> as i wrote it
[21:51:15] <Cork> but as i'm not exactly sure how you want it on the server side, i added a new value
[21:51:27] <Cork> you can rename that as you please, shouldn't matter
[21:51:42] <lenswipe> its just that a var_dump($_POST) gives: array(0) { }
[21:51:54] <Cork> no post at all???
[21:52:55] <lenswipe> nope
[21:53:19] <lenswipe> zlich post
[21:53:32] <wkmanire> phphphphp
[21:53:54] * lenswipe yawns at wkmanire 
[21:54:03] * wkmanire dodges
[21:55:30] <lenswipe> Cork any ideas?
[21:55:37] <Cork> lenswipe: your sure you want the load in the success?
[21:55:45] <lenswipe> huh?
[21:56:01] <Cork> lenswipe: i suspect this is what you want http://jsfiddle.net/wKV52/3/
[21:56:09] <Cork> (don't forget to change the url
[21:56:10] <Cork> )
[21:57:18] <Cork> gah a typo...
[21:57:38] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wKV52/4/
[21:58:10] <lenswipe> nope
[21:58:13] <lenswipe> not what i want
[21:58:19] <lenswipe> it doesnt do anything at all
[21:58:27] <Cork> it does
[21:58:50] <Cork> what you did was do a post to the server, when it respond
[21:59:02] <Cork> send a NEW request to the server with no params
[21:59:36] <Cork> i suspect you want to just append the response from the server to the page
[21:59:43] <lenswipe> indeed
[21:59:55] <Cork> and thats what the changed code does
[22:00:02] <lenswipe> except it doesnt
[22:00:10] <Cork> just check over the names and urls
[22:00:12] <lenswipe> oh wait
[22:00:26] <lenswipe> yep still no post data
[22:00:29] <Cork> i updated so it works on jsfiddle, thats why you need to
[22:00:36] <Cork> then your server is broken
[22:00:43] <lenswipe> my server is fine
[22:00:46] <lenswipe> your code is broken :p
[22:00:48] <Cork> cause jsfiddle reports posted data
[22:01:53] <lenswipe> really?
[22:01:57] <lenswipe> im not seeing any posted data
[22:02:31] <Cork> ci_csrf_token	8473b0cef1198341f14946626db79031
[22:02:31] <Cork> feed[]	50
[22:02:31] <Cork> feed[]	51
[22:02:31] <Cork> feed[]	52
[22:02:48] <Cork> thats what the server reseaves, as an example
[22:04:40] <lenswipe> Cork your jsfiddle isnt showing me post data
[22:05:48] <Cork> lenswipe: it doesn't give any putput if thats what you mean, cause the server script doens't echo the params
[22:05:57] <Cork> but it does get them
[22:06:00] <lenswipe> hmm
[22:06:09] <lenswipe> tonowhere (~Adium@78-105-3-181.zone3.bethere.co.uk) has joined #jquery
[22:06:09] <lenswipe> <Cork> but
[22:06:11] <lenswipe> ewps
[22:06:20] <lenswipe> Cork http://openpaste.org/27595/inline/
[22:06:23] <lenswipe> thats my code
[22:07:06] <Cork> ya, and that sends data, i've verified it several times
[22:07:31] <Cork> $_POST['feed'] is an array with the checked checkboxes values
[22:08:23] <lenswipe> Cork interesting
[22:08:49] <lenswipe> Cork if i put var_dump($_POST) at the start of my front controller it shows the crsf token
[22:10:30] <Cork> lenswipe: how this works is that jquery stringify the data
[22:10:55] <lenswipe> it clearly isnt doing becuse its not being sent
[22:11:03] <Cork> lenswipe: it detects that feed is an array, and loops over each value and converts it to feed[]=<val>&feed[]=<val>
[22:11:09] <Cork> and thats what php expects
[22:11:22] <Cork> lenswipe: the client side does
[22:11:23] <lenswipe> but its not being sent
[22:11:31] <Cork> and if hte server does what it should it does too
[22:11:44] <lenswipe> see above
[22:11:47] <Cork> well the code i've seen and touch works
[22:12:03] <Cork> i can't say anything about the rest
[22:12:06] <lenswipe> if i do var_dump($_POST) in index.php my crsf token is shown, but nothing else
[22:16:28] <lenswipe> Cork what is "elm"
[22:17:07] <Cork> lenswipe: $.map loops over the values returned by $(), that is elm
[22:17:19] <Cork> so its each instance of the input elements
[22:17:25] <lenswipe> so any thoughts on how i can debug this?
[22:18:07] <Cork> lenswipe: the debug console and verify the selectors
[22:18:26] <Cork> and then trach the network trafic and see that the data comes through
[22:18:39] <Cork> and finally debug your server config/scripts
[22:19:15] <Cork> trach==track
[22:19:40] <lenswipe> my server config is fine
[22:19:43] <lenswipe> never had any issues before now
[22:19:48] <lenswipe> and post data defo works
[22:27:19] <lenswipe> Cork poke
[22:29:09] <lenswipe> Cork i put console.log(data) into the code
[22:29:10] <lenswipe> Cork it spat out: feed: Array[0]
[22:29:10] <lenswipe> length: 0
[22:29:10] <lenswipe> thought youd like to know
[22:29:10] <lenswipe> :)
[22:35:46] <Cork> lenswipe: data?
[22:35:54] <Cork> as far as i know we never use data in the post
[22:40:11] <lenswipe> Cork  $.post("<?= site_url('ajax/feedchecks') ?>", data, function(data) {
[22:40:29] <lenswipe> Cork var data = {
[22:40:30] <lenswipe>                         feed: $.map($('input[name=feed\[\]]:checked'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val(); }),
[22:40:30] <lenswipe>                         ci_csrf_token: $('input[name=ci_csrf_token]').val(),
[22:40:30] <lenswipe>                     };
[22:41:58] <Cork> lenswipe: then you need to verify that your names/selectors match whats in use on the jsfiddle example
[22:42:08] <Cork> cause something differ in your live code
[22:42:23] <lenswipe> they do
[22:47:07] <lenswipe> Cork the guy from #codeigniter reconed it was something to do with the :checked selector
[22:47:32] <Cork> it isn't
[22:50:29] <Cork> lenswipe: the example on jsfiddle works, use that as a base, and check where your code differ
[22:50:52] <Cork> lenswipe: then make sure that the difference is handled correctly, and your code should work
[22:51:10] <Cork> heres the link if you lost it http://jsfiddle.net/wKV52/4/
[22:51:21] <lenswipe> what version of jquery is your jsfiddle using?
[22:51:31] <Cork> its listed on the left
[22:54:54] <lenswipe> Cork i changed the version of jquery
[22:54:56] <lenswipe> its posting now
[23:00:49] <diegoviola> can i use coffeescript with jquery?
[23:02:12] <wkmanire> diegoviola: http://geekiriki.blogspot.com/2010/08/jquery-meets-coffeescript.html
[23:02:14] <wkmanire> seems like it
[23:02:21] <ralc> hey guys. I added some code today, but comparing with an old version i realize that my site has slowed to a crawl. Is there any performance tests i can do to pin-point the problem?
[23:02:23] <diegoviola> nice
[23:02:24] <wkmanire> I just kind of perused that, I didn't verify anything

[23:07:31] <matter> Hi Guys, I would like to make the same time of navigation as this website : http://www.nikeskateboarding.com/apparel#/filter/all  when you click on an item, it show up a div, then scroll to the content...any idea to do something like that ? cheers
[23:08:46] <lenswipe> Cork i have another question
[23:09:06] <lenswipe> Cork how do i use another page as the content to fill the div with?
[23:12:37] <codejunkee> Just upgraded to jquery v1.6 and found removeClass with animation (setting duration value) no longer works. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/Q7ejjwua
[23:12:42] <wkmanire> well crap, I broke it. *sigh*
[23:17:18] <wkmanire> there, working again.
[23:19:33] <matter> no one ?
[23:20:27] <wkmanire> matter: There is a lot going on there
[23:20:44] <wkmanire> matter: scroll position, hash manipulation
[23:20:49] <wkmanire> matter:just to name a couple
[23:21:05] * abjorn wiggles
[23:21:07] <matter> thanks wkmanire
[23:21:08] <wkmanire> I think there is a plugin for messing with scroll position.
[23:21:21] <wkmanire> There are a few libraries out there for dealing with the hash
[23:21:27] <wkmanire> matter: check out microjs.com
[23:21:39] <wkmanire> abjorn: Howdy
[23:21:53] <abjorn> sup sup

[23:24:45] <abjorn> neato :o
[23:25:29] <wkmanire> I hate having to use nth-child like that, but not sure how else to ensure the correct element gets selected.
[23:25:54] <wkmanire> Other than maybe looking for unique attributes.
[23:26:51] * lenswipe pokes Cork

[23:38:20] <aLinux> hi, can i ask question ?
[23:38:31] <wkmanire> aLinux: You can ask any question except for that one.
[23:38:45] <aLinux> the jquery is not working, http://bpaste.net/show/16187/ , is there any error here ?
[23:39:36] <wkmanire> aLinux: $this-> is invalid.
[23:39:57] <wkmanire> aLinux: Javascript doesn't use -> to dereference instance members.
[23:40:21] <wkmanire> aLinux: do this instead $(this).css("border", "13px solid red");
[23:40:56] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16188/
[23:41:03] <sshaginyan> I have a problem with http://www.kgbcustoms.com/tracking. When jquery-ui tabs loads ups it does this a snap movement from anchor links to tabs. How can I solve this problem?
[23:41:15] <wkmanire> aLinux: still wrong $(this).css(/*snip*/)
[23:41:25] <wkmanire> aLinux: the dollar sign is not special syntax
[23:41:38] <wkmanire> aLinux: In javascript the dollar sign $ is a valid character for a variable name
[23:41:55] <aLinux> still doesn't work, http://bpaste.net/show/16189/
[23:41:57] <wkmanire> aLinux: To help declutter jQuery syntax, they use the $ as an alias for jQuery
[23:42:14] <wkmanire> aLinux: so $(this).doSomething() is the same as jQuery(this).doSomething()
[23:42:22] <aLinux> still doesn't work, http://bpaste.net/show/16189/
[23:43:03] <wkmanire> aLinux: Your syntax is valid. If it doesn't work then there is another problem somewhere else in your page.
[23:44:10] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: I see what you're saying
[23:44:20] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: thanks
[23:44:42] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: I tried moving the css to the base page but it didn't help
[23:45:02] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: closer to the base page
[23:45:55] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: The css is being loaded in the header correct?
[23:46:01] <sshaginyan> yes
[23:46:19] <wkmanire> Then it should be available for the DOM draws...
[23:46:24] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: What do you mean by correctly?
[23:46:46] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: I was request affirmation.
[23:46:48] <wkmanire> requesting*
[23:47:04] <wkmanire> correct !== correctly
[23:47:28] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: yes
[23:47:54] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: Do you want me to show you?
[23:48:10] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: I'm not sure how to get around it to be honest. It seems as though this is happening as the tabsare being initialized.

[23:49:32] <wkmanire> I can see that on this page a lot of CSS is being applied via Javascript
[23:49:55] <wkmanire> every single one of those CSS manipulations is going to cue up a redraw.
[23:49:58] <wkmanire> a browser reflow
[23:50:00] <wkmanire> Which is slow.
[23:50:08] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: I did use html to load the ui (css) but it didn't help
[23:50:27] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: only the ui (css)
[23:50:51] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: What do you suggest?
[23:51:18] <wkmanire> There are techniques for queuing up lots of DOM manipulations to avoid reflow issues.
[23:51:24] <wkmanire> I'm googling right now for an article for you.
[23:52:30] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: I can't find a good article for you
[23:52:41] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: :(
[23:52:53] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: Come back and ask your question again a little bit later. There are some other people that fequent this channel that are more knowledgable than I on this subject.
[23:53:09] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: What time?
[23:53:15] <wkmanire> I really don't know.
[23:53:25] <wkmanire> The regulars tend to come and go throughout the day.
[23:53:32] <sshaginyan> what are some key terms for my problem?
[23:53:44] <wkmanire> DOM reflow, efficient DOM manipulations
[23:53:49] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: DOM manipulation reflow issues?
[23:53:53] <sshaginyan> I see
[23:53:53] <wkmanire> yes
[23:53:54] <sshaginyan> thanks
[23:53:59] <wkmanire> No problem
[23:56:02] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: If I put the ui (css) as a <link rel="stylesheet" ....  just below the head of my document would that solve my problem?
[23:56:15] <wkmanire> no
[23:56:16] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: I did try that and it didn't. But shouldn't it have?
[23:56:53] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: Everytime CSS is manipulated by javascript the browser has to reconsider some or all of the DOM and rerender itself.
[23:57:16] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: I see
[23:57:25] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: So $('#foo').css('width', '10px'); has a performance cost
[23:57:39] <wkmanire> usually it is not noticeable because we don't do that many manipulations as the page is loading.
[23:57:46] <wkmanire> But in your case you have hundreds of lines of DOM manipulations
[23:57:54] <wkmanire> Just in that one script I looked at.
[23:58:13] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: :(
[23:59:55] <aLinux> is there any error here, ? http://bpaste.net/show/16192/
