[00:00:12] <ak5> Cork: fluid width :D
[00:00:29] <Cork> ak5: doesn't matter
[00:00:37] <Cork> ?.offset()
[00:00:37] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[00:03:26] <ak5> Cork: ok, thanks that works
[00:03:48] <ak5> it's a little tougher, since I am dragging the things from one <div> to another <div>
[00:04:06] <ak5> so I am now changing the html ith jquery, then adding position relative
[00:04:13] <ak5> but it seems to work, thanks
[00:06:18] <Thorn> hello
[00:06:56] <Thorn> I have mouseover/mouseout events on an element. is there a way to prevent them from firing when mouse goes over child elements within that element?
[00:07:25] <Cork> thorie: see ?.mouseenter and see ?.mouseleave
[00:07:25] <bot-t> thorie, .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[00:07:26] <bot-t> thorie, .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[00:08:18] <Thorn> seems to work, thanks
[00:14:42] <ak5> does anyone know how to get jplayer to display milliseconds in current timestamp and duration?
[00:31:13] <Thorn> is there any way to remove an element from the flow and have it remain where it was? (and not create a gap for following elements to flow into...)
[00:32:18] <Cork> Thorn: you want the element to keep the area clean you mean?
[00:32:37] <Cork> ?mdc visibility @ Thorn
[00:32:42] <bot-t> Thorn, visibility - CSS | MDN - The visibility CSS property has two purposes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/visibility
[00:35:21] <Thorn> I want it to become a popup basically.
[00:35:37] <Thorn> I guess I can duplicate it and position it absolutely
[00:36:37] <Thorn> imagine an image gallery, you move mouse over an image and it expands (I think google image search does that)
[00:39:20] <seutje> Thorn: you could use transforms, they don't manipulate the bounding box of the element
[00:39:52] <Thorn> can they do an equivalent of height:auto; overflow:auto; ?
[00:44:31] <seutje> Thorn: http://jsfiddle.net/ucgyB/
[00:45:47] <seutje> (you prolly also wanna set position to relative and manipulate the z-index on hover)
[00:46:33] <w00tner> hi guys im working with images and i upload an image and append it to a div call crop container
[00:46:37] <w00tner> $('#crop_container').append('<img style="DISPLAY: block; FILTER: glow(color=black)progid filter:alpha(opacity=70); /* IE */ -moz-opacity:0.5; /* Firefox, Opera, ... */ opacity: 0.5; /* CSS 3*/ MARGIN: 0 0 0 0; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" id="cropTarget" src="images/'+data+'. File Name: '+dataArray[index].name+' />');
[00:46:43] <Thorn> that is nice but not actually what I want. thanks anyway, might be useful later
[00:47:26] <w00tner> how do i store the src of the image in a variable  and pass it to a function   that initiate the cropping plugin
[00:54:02] <ak5> does anyone know how to get jplayer to display milliseconds in current timestamp and duration?
[00:56:50] <w00tner> how can i pass a variable value to a custom function ???
[00:58:43] <p3lim_> Cork: I got a bigger snippet of my whole code if you want to help me understand what I'm doing wrong, I get errors that an element is missing a method (basically means the element is wrong)
[00:58:46] <p3lim_> http://jsfiddle.net/XGZAA/
[00:59:45] <p3lim_> had a little typo, http://jsfiddle.net/XGZAA/1/
[01:00:39] <ak5> can someone point me in the right direction starting a timer on event and reading values from this timer in JS?
[01:01:19] <Cork> p3lim: everything you're doing on audio won't work
[01:01:36] <Cork> src isn't a jquery variable you need prop('src', url)
[01:01:42] <Cork> same for type
[01:01:49] <Cork> use bind instead of addEventListener
[01:02:04] <Cork> don't use live
[01:02:08] <Cork> its depricated
[01:02:23] <Cork> audio.play(); needs to be audio[0].play();
[01:02:26] <Cork> same for pause
[01:02:49] <seutje> Thorn: aw man, u didn't like my turd? :(
[01:03:04] <Cork> p3lim: audio.currentTime won't work same with duation
[01:05:12] <w00tner>  i upload a file and append it to a div  and append it using: $('#crop_container').append('<img style="DISPLAY: block; FILTER: glow(color=black)progid filter:alpha(opacity=70); /* IE */ -moz-opacity:0.5; /* Firefox, Opera, ... */ opacity: 0.5; /* CSS 3*/ MARGIN: 0 0 0 0; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" id="cropTarget" src="images/'+data+'. File Name: '+dataArray[index].name+' />');
[01:05:14] <w00tner> i want to store src="images/'+data+'. File Name: '+dataArray[index].name+' n a variable  so i can pass it to a function that initiate the croping tool .... in the function you have this  image:{           source: image.jpg,    i want to raplace it for the src after the appending the function is called using as source the data stored in a variable
[01:07:07] <AL13N_work> shoky: thanks, that was it... i've overlooked it
[01:09:37] <MiracleBlue> Hey guys :)
[01:18:24] <R00tk3y> Hello I have a question
[01:18:46] <R00tk3y> How do I do a self invoking function after chained command
[01:21:12] <w00tner> i append a uploaded file into a div and it does this var realData = '<li><a href="images/'+dataSplit[0]+'">'+fileName+'</a> '+dataSplit[1]+'</li>';
[01:21:26] <w00tner> how can i store the href value
[01:21:29] <w00tner> into a variable
[01:21:53] <w00tner> i've tried var cropSource = 'images/'+dataSplit[0]+'';  but nothing happens
[01:22:18] <w00tner> i just want to store the url relative path like that and then pass the variable to a function
[01:22:19] <se-lite_> w00tner: upload a file into a div?
[01:22:26] <w00tner> i upload the file into the server
[01:22:57] <w00tner> then append it using $('#draggable').append('<img alt="" id="cropTarget" src="images/'+dataSplit[0]+' "/>');
[01:23:06] <w00tner> it works great
[01:23:30] <w00tner> but the thing is i want to start the crop tools using a function but the function needs a "image path"
[01:23:33] <se-lite_> what is dataSplit?
[01:25:24] <R00tk3y> Splits a string into an array
[01:26:02] <R00tk3y> He probably used .split, and he's referring to it via datasplit variable
[01:26:31] <se-lite_> w00tner: you realize that you already use the path to the file in your code?
[01:26:41] <w00tner> yes
[01:26:47] <w00tner> but i cant retrieve it
[01:26:53] <R00tk3y> W00tner
[01:26:55] <R00tk3y> Show me the code
[01:27:03] <se-lite_> var path = 'images/'+dataSplit[0];
[01:27:29] <R00tk3y> Okay and dataSplit[0] has .jpg/.png or whatever extension it is?
[01:27:50] <se-lite_> however, this seem like a very basic java script question, non related to #jquery :/
[01:28:02] <w00tner> yeah!!
[01:28:02] <R00tk3y> W00tner try alerting (dataSplit[0])
[01:28:05] <w00tner> it worked
[01:28:06] <R00tk3y> and see what is in it
[01:28:09] <w00tner> var path = 'images/'+dataSplit[0];
[01:28:10] <R00tk3y> What worked?
[01:28:29] <R00tk3y> Excellent.
[01:29:23] <R00tk3y> Anyone know how to do self invoking fucntion after chained command?
[01:29:41] <w00tner> so i initialize this function
[01:29:42] <w00tner> http://pastebin.com/rw6Hh6f4
[01:29:46] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: not sure if i understand the question
[01:30:00] <w00tner> there is a line image:{           source: cropSource,
[01:30:11] <w00tner> how do i pass it ?
[01:30:17] <R00tk3y> $('#header').slideUp('easy').$(function() { } ); ...
[01:30:19] <R00tk3y> doesn't work
[01:30:36] <w00tner> function initCrop(cropSource)
[01:30:38] <w00tner> ?
[01:30:50] <w00tner> i want to pass the value of the variable to the function
[01:31:20] <R00tk3y> Look at that beautiful JSON object
[01:31:21] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: you probably have to use the callback if you want something to happend after the slide
[01:31:58] <R00tk3y> se lite, well the im using $('#header, #otherdiv').slideUp(...)
[01:32:04] <R00tk3y> so it runs the function twice
[01:32:10] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: type: slideUp('easy', function () { // Do stuffÂ }
[01:32:33] <se-lite_> and a ) at the end :p
[01:32:33] <R00tk3y> Yeah se-lite, I want to chain the command so that it only performs it after it ran it both times on the two divs
[01:32:45] <R00tk3y> Maybe I just can't
[01:33:22] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: i would think the call back would work, tho i don't know what exactly what you try to do
[01:33:39] <se-lite_> callback get executed when animation is done
[01:36:04] <R00tk3y> Why does this not work
[01:36:04] <R00tk3y> $('#register-header h1').slideUp('slow').$('#register-header span').slideUp('slow', function()
[01:36:16] <R00tk3y> Maybe I should have used .end
[01:36:47] <seutje> there is no $.fn.$ method, is there?
[01:36:55] <R00tk3y> Nope
[01:36:59] <R00tk3y> Didnt work either
[01:37:05] <seutje> so that's why that doesn't work
[01:37:08] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: jsfiddle
[01:37:15] <R00tk3y> Seutje, what?
[01:37:26] <R00tk3y> Self invoking function seutje?
[01:37:44] <seutje> u asked why it doesn't work, it doesn't work cause there is no jQuery.fn.$ method
[01:38:24] <darkangel> I'm going insane ... why would my layout be loading inside a jQuery UI tab? I don't even want it to use AJAX. I used the default example here: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#default and it still does it.
[01:38:31] <R00tk3y> $(function(){...});
[01:38:35] <R00tk3y> Is valid seutje?
[01:38:44] <seutje> just like $('.randomshit').woezelwaazel() doesn't work cause there is no $.fn.woezelwaazel method
[01:38:54] <R00tk3y> Unless you define it
[01:38:58] <seutje> R00tk3y: sure
[01:39:56] <seutje> R00tk3y: ur prolly looking to use a deferred
[01:40:02] <R00tk3y> Explain
[01:41:17] <darkangel> Figured it out :D ... was bc I was using: <base href="" />
[01:41:36] <R00tk3y> jQuery.Deferred() provides flexible ways to provide multiple callbacks, and these callbacks can be invoked regardless of whether the original callback dispatch has already occurred.
[01:41:44] <R00tk3y> I don't want that functionality
[01:42:04] <seutje> var $wrap = $('#register-header'); $.when($wrap.find('h1').add($wrap.find('span')).slideUp('slow')).then(function(){ console.log('ALL DONE!'); }); or something?
[01:42:04] <R00tk3y> I want something to occur after a slideUp
[01:42:06] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: is there many animations at the same time, or just one at the time?
[01:42:17] <R00tk3y> Umm thats pretty ugly
[01:42:38] <R00tk3y> But I see what your saying
[01:42:50] <ravenzz> anyone familiar with requirejs?
[01:42:52] <seutje> at least I'm not repeating a selector
[01:43:13] <seutje> but yeah, good luck with that attitude
[01:43:28] <R00tk3y> Seutje, I did that because it wouldn't run it the way I wanted to
[01:43:54] <R00tk3y> I orignally had $('#selector, #selector')
[01:44:53] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: http://jsfiddle.net/4V9VF/1/ is also an animation.. But, as long as you don't post what you want, only how you try to do it, its not easy to help you
[01:45:46] <R00tk3y> Se-lite now what if I have two selector, and I only want a function to be ran after both animations
[01:46:11] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: both animate at the same time, but only do stuff when both are done?
[01:46:27] <R00tk3y> Oh should I just
[01:46:30] <seutje> I'ma time this
[01:46:31] <R00tk3y> Put the other one inside it
[01:46:50] <R00tk3y> Alright that should work
[01:47:01] <R00tk3y> But now im curious about that $.when stuff seutje was talking about
[01:47:19] <R00tk3y> But seutje is butt hurt b/c I told him that the code was ugly
[01:47:30] <R00tk3y> So he's gonna be a little piss pot about it and make cryptic comments in the chat
[01:48:04] <se-lite_> R00tk3y: http://jsfiddle.net/4V9VF/4/
[01:48:06] <se-lite_> like that?
[01:48:25] <seutje> nah, I'm butt hurt cause of ur general attitude
[01:48:35] <R00tk3y> Se-lite perfect!
[01:48:48] <R00tk3y> Didn't know there was a css3 selector for that
[01:48:54] <seutje> that's sizzle
[01:48:57] <seutje> enjoy the perf
[01:49:25] <seutje> compare it to a deferred ;)

[01:58:48] <AL13N_work> is this about jslint settings?
[01:58:52] <seutje> 1. you aren't using 'use strict' at the top
[01:59:03] <AL13N_work> heh, javascript has that too?
[01:59:23] <seutje> 2. your function declarations are leaking into the global scope

[02:06:03] <aro> anyone know why this: http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/A4588/1/ fails with jquery ui enabled?
[02:06:25] <R00tk3y> Aro
[02:06:29] <R00tk3y> It could be because of the $
[02:06:37] <R00tk3y> Try Jquery.
[02:06:51] <seutje> AL13N_work: what do u mean? u just wrap it around the whole to create a scope
[02:07:13] <aro> still fails
[02:07:15] <aro> i tried that already
[02:07:23] <R00tk3y> Im thinking it because of the two libraries
[02:07:25] <aro> besides
[02:07:27] <R00tk3y> Both use the $
[02:07:32] <aro> jquery tends to work well with jquery ui
[02:08:05] <R00tk3y> Does it ever call that function, at all?
[02:08:17] <R00tk3y> What errors did you get in console (via firebug, etc)
[02:08:19] <aro> what function?
[02:08:34] <R00tk3y> The one you just fiddled
[02:08:40] <aro> ???
[02:08:48] <R00tk3y> Aro
[02:08:48] <aro> are you asking me if that function is called?
[02:08:57] <R00tk3y> No...
[02:08:58] <R00tk3y> http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/A4588/1/
[02:09:04] <aro> yes i am there
[02:09:16] <R00tk3y> What is this? You are calling a self invoking function
[02:09:22] <aro> no offense, but are you insane?
[02:09:35] <aro> you *have* used jquery before, right?
[02:09:39] <R00tk3y> Yes
[02:10:09] <aro> ok, then you know that this is the same as $(document).ready(function() { }
[02:10:11] <aro> );
[02:10:14] <R00tk3y> Yes
[02:10:18] <R00tk3y> Its the shortcut method
[02:10:28] <R00tk3y> The anonymous function
[02:10:36] <R00tk3y> Put (jQuery)
[02:10:39] <R00tk3y> at the very end of it
[02:10:41] <R00tk3y> And see if that works
[02:10:45] <aro> it wont
[02:11:05] <AL13N_work> seutje: oooh, like that
[02:11:07] <aro> it will break it
[02:12:20] <R00tk3y> So if you take out jquery ui
[02:12:21] <R00tk3y> it works fine?
[02:12:27] <aro> correct
[02:12:40] <R00tk3y> Okay
[02:12:46] <aro> look in your console, you will see that height is returned as NaN
[02:12:53] <R00tk3y> Correct
[02:12:55] <seutje> aro: odd, that outerHeight call seems to be returning a jquery object for some reason
[02:13:02] <R00tk3y> Did you trying taking out all that code
[02:13:05] <R00tk3y> and just putting an alert in there
[02:13:19] <aro> an alert in place of what?
[02:13:31] <R00tk3y> Inside the function
[02:13:45] <aro> i *know* it works
[02:13:45] <R00tk3y> It deffinately seems due to a namespace conflict
[02:13:57] <aro> its nothing to do with namespaces

[02:14:15] <R00tk3y> Well you know what i mean
[02:14:30] <aro> i dont really :)
[02:14:37] <seutje> added a false in that outerheight to excluse marging (it's the default), which somehow made it not return a jquery object anymore
[02:14:46] <seutje> alse took the liberty of keeping ur variables scoped
[02:14:52] <seutje> hope u don't mind
[02:15:24] <aro> what?
[02:15:38] <seutje> do I just press up arrow and return?
[02:16:23] <aro> i cant tell if you are talking to me
[02:16:23] <R00tk3y> Seutje, I dont think thats his problem
[02:16:37] <R00tk3y> His problem is the libraries don't want to work together
[02:17:04] <R00tk3y> The code works if he doesn't include the other library
[02:17:18] <AL13N_work> seutje: so, there's an error about h, it seems; (next to complaining that $ is undefined) i do var h = (m < 5); and later if (h) ? but doesn't that mean h should be boolean? why would it give an error?
[02:17:22] <seutje> I didn't remove the exclusion
[02:17:30] <seutje> inclusion*
[02:18:09] <seutje> aro: I was
[02:18:27] <aro> is this a bug? or am i doing something wrong?
[02:18:29] <AL13N_work> how do i use jshint instead of jslint on jsfiddle?
[02:18:34] <seutje> don't really know
[02:18:46] <R00tk3y> Why dont you just use document ready
[02:18:54] <seutje> he is using document ready
[02:18:55] <AL13N_work> seutje: should i use something else rather than jsfiddle?
[02:19:04] <seutje> AL13N_work: fiddle does linting now?

[02:19:26] <R00tk3y> Hmm
[02:19:54] <AL13N_work> seutje: ok, so i'm clearly using the wrong site; what should i do to try such things?
[02:20:02] <seutje> aw snap, I never even noticed that button
[02:20:21] <seutje> AL13N_work: I dunno, I just jshint in my sublime
[02:20:21] <R00tk3y> Okay
[02:20:26] <R00tk3y> I think I might have found the answer
[02:20:37] <AL13N_work> seutje: where can i find this sublime?
[02:20:46] <R00tk3y> Aro
[02:20:49] <R00tk3y> Put this in the function

[02:20:50] <aro> yes
[02:21:08] <R00tk3y> Like before it

[02:21:25] <R00tk3y> Aro
[02:21:26] <seutje> sorry, dupe of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12293
[02:21:41] <R00tk3y> You have your <script src="jqueryui.js"/>
[02:21:53] <R00tk3y> and then your jquery
[02:22:00] <R00tk3y> And then do this
[02:22:05] <R00tk3y> <script> jQuery.noConflict() </script>
[02:22:06] <R00tk3y> Okay?
[02:22:17] <aro> hang on
[02:22:28] <R00tk3y> And actually for the time being
[02:22:46] <R00tk3y> You can actually put that in your script file to be honest aro
[02:22:48] <aro> that throws an error
[02:22:53] <R00tk3y> Whats the error?
[02:22:58] <aro> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function
[02:23:20] <R00tk3y> Okay did you include it inside of you
[02:23:22] <R00tk3y> script file?
[02:23:26] <aro> yeah
[02:23:32] <R00tk3y> At the very beginning I assume

[02:26:40] <R00tk3y> ?
[02:26:41] <jaydev> which has search results.
[02:26:42] <jaydev> http://dev.jumpcatch.com/tigermom/school-search/
[02:26:44] <jaydev> in the perticular school, there is one compare button, by clickinig that school can be added to the compare bar.
[02:26:45] <jaydev> this works perfectly for this page. but I want this functionality to work in all the pages. and there i am facing the problem
[02:27:14] <R00tk3y> Jaydev im lost
[02:27:24] <jaydev> pls go through the matter I entered
[02:27:32] <R00tk3y> Okay this guy is from india
[02:27:41] <R00tk3y> Paris, FR
[02:27:47] <R00tk3y> Nope thats the node
[02:27:54] <seutje> aro: found it?
[02:27:55] <jaydev> india.
[02:28:11] <aro> nope
[02:28:11] <R00tk3y> Yeah jaydev
[02:28:11] <aro> not yet
[02:28:16] <jaydev> dev.jumpcatch.com/tigermom/
[02:28:19] <R00tk3y> Why do you freelance if you don't know jquery lol
[02:28:21] <seutje> "Please upgrade jqueryUI to 1.8.22, as that's the one that's compatible with jQuery 1.8"
[02:28:31] <R00tk3y> Whenever I found a freelancer for jquery
[02:28:36] <R00tk3y> they never knew how to do anything
[02:28:41] <seutje> also: "Well it doesn't work with jquery-ui-1.8.20/ui/minified/jquery.ui.core.min.js but it works with jquery-ui-1.8.22/ui/minified/jquery.ui.core.min.js."
[02:29:10] <jaydev> I am here to know something
[02:29:23] <R00tk3y> Yeah you are
[02:29:25] <seutje> aro: and it looks like ur trying to use jQuery UI 1.8.18
[02:29:36] <jaydev> just for guidance
[02:29:40] <R00tk3y> JayDev, what is the name of your js file you're writing your jquery in
[02:29:51] <jaydev> script.js
[02:29:55] <seutje> aro: which means you need to explicitly pass true/false or it'll return a jQuery object instead of an int
[02:30:20] <R00tk3y> Still using .live jaydev?
[02:30:37] <seutje> which is what I did for you, about 15 mins ago
[02:30:47] <seutje> before the whole noconflict circlejerk
[02:30:48] <jaydev> yes I am using in this
[02:31:22] <R00tk3y> Okay so you want to reuse functionality of what
[02:31:54] <jaydev> yes
[02:32:03] <R00tk3y> Yes.
[02:32:07] <jaydev> my problem is that when I go to the other page
[02:32:29] <jaydev> this functionality, not work
[02:32:38] <R00tk3y> Great
[02:32:48] <R00tk3y> Mind telling me what functionality
[02:32:48] <jaydev> I know the reason
[02:32:58] <jaydev> I can not find the real logic to solve it
[02:33:02] <R00tk3y> Jaydev
[02:33:09] <R00tk3y> Do you mean the search criteria
[02:33:10] <R00tk3y> ?
[02:33:15] <jaydev> no no
[02:33:21] <R00tk3y> Okay tell me where to look
[02:33:26] <jaydev> in that page
[02:33:32] <R00tk3y> Okay
[02:33:37] <jaydev> there are compare buttons
[02:33:55] <R00tk3y> Oh yes
[02:33:56] <R00tk3y> I see now
[02:33:59] <jaydev> for adding the perticular schools in compare bar
[02:34:11] <R00tk3y> Okay
[02:34:27] <R00tk3y> Now you want to compare these schools?
[02:34:33] <R00tk3y> When someone clicks compare now?
[02:34:36] <jaydev> by adding the school to campare bar
[02:34:50] <R00tk3y> Yeah it added them for me, so whats wrong
[02:35:11] <jaydev> I am adding the button id (same as schoolid) i added it to cookie
[02:35:21] <jaydev> named 'query'
[02:35:28] <R00tk3y> Why dont you add it with a data attr?
[02:36:02] <jaydev> I need this for through out the site
[02:36:09] <R00tk3y> Oh okay
[02:36:18] <R00tk3y> Okay so they are added now what
[02:37:04] <jaydev> by adding and removing, buttons are enabled and disabled as well
[02:37:15] <R00tk3y> Okayu
[02:37:20] <R00tk3y> So what is the problem.
[02:38:04] <jaydev> do have schools added in compare bar?
[02:38:22] <R00tk3y> Yep
[02:38:58] <jaydev> now pls click on "more details" link, near to compare button
[02:39:14] <jaydev> you will get another page
[02:39:25] <R00tk3y> Okay
[02:40:05] <jaydev> when you remove schools from this page
[02:40:30] <jaydev> all the three school and again go to previous page
[02:40:49] <jaydev> and try to add school , the problem arise
[02:41:03] <R00tk3y> I see
[02:41:55] <R00tk3y> After cookie amount = 3 it shows disabled button
[02:42:18] <R00tk3y> And it seems when we go to the other page it somehow increases the amount because it reloads the page and then readds the school count
[02:42:58] <jaydev> yes
[02:43:06] <jaydev> that is wrong count
[02:43:23] <jaydev> because it is based on a class
[02:43:29] <jaydev> "schoolfilled"
[02:43:36] <R00tk3y> right
[02:44:03] <jaydev> which I am adding run time , and can not be font again in other page
[02:44:12] <jaydev> when page reloads
[02:44:24] <R00tk3y> Right
[02:44:25] <jaydev> I want a perfect logic to do this
[02:44:29] <R00tk3y> Well
[02:44:37] <R00tk3y> You need to sit down and think out how you did it
[02:44:47] <R00tk3y> Because I can really read through 800 lines of code
[02:44:51] <R00tk3y> And figure it out
[02:45:06] <jaydev> right
[02:45:18] <R00tk3y> It seems when you reload the page it readds the count
[02:45:25] <jaydev> yes
[02:45:39] <R00tk3y> You should have one cookie
[02:45:47] <R00tk3y> containing the count, and another containing an array
[02:45:52] <R00tk3y> of the school ids
[02:46:04] <lars_> Hi folks, in the $.on() method, there is no way to pass the context/scope in which to execute the callback handler. I wonder if there's a good reason for this? I know of the options to e.g. use $.proxy() for this, but life would be so much easier if you can just pass the context for this.
[02:46:18] <jaydev> okay
[02:46:24] <R00tk3y> And when you remove the school from the list
[02:46:31] <R00tk3y> it should reenabled the disabled compare button
[02:46:38] <R00tk3y> and then remove it from the cookie query or w/e you named it
[02:47:29] <jaydev> so i have to make another cookie to store this count.
[02:47:36] <jaydev> right?
[02:47:45] <R00tk3y> Yes
[02:48:01] <R00tk3y> And then add an event to that little x out button in the compare dialog box
[02:48:05] <R00tk3y> compare box
[02:48:40] <R00tk3y> #containe-compare-1
[02:48:48] <R00tk3y> Ill pm you ok
[02:49:06] <jaydev> thanks
[03:50:55] <_MagePsycho> do you guys know which jquery slider does this job: http://snag.gy/ZlEez.jpg
[03:51:43] <dblosevn> _MagePsycho: be a lot easier to determine if it wasnd an image of the slider
[03:51:53] <dblosevn> *wasnt
[03:52:15] <_MagePsycho> dblosevn: can you explain plz
[03:52:45] <dblosevn> _MagePsycho: you pasted an image of the slider if we cant see the actual slider we cant possibly tell you what they used...
[03:53:04] <NodeX> lol
[03:53:23] <_MagePsycho> thats an psd .. a new requirement :)
[03:53:24] <dblosevn> some peoples kids
[03:53:46] <_MagePsycho> if i  have the website i would have grabbed from source view ;)
[03:53:56] <dblosevn> _MagePsycho: your making your self look worse by the minute
[03:54:22] <dblosevn> any jquery slider can do that, you just need to style it with css appropriately
[03:54:23] <xec> dblosevn: the slider doesn't exist yet - he's looking for ways to make one
[03:54:43] <_MagePsycho> dblosevn: any idea which slider slides two images at once (vertically)
[03:55:43] <dblosevn> just tweak the css make the ul 2 images wide and 3 tall, and use a slider that supports vertical sliding
[03:56:45] <dblosevn> it should just work you may have an issue if theres an odd number of images but it should be fine
[03:57:00] <dns-away> how I can insert on #('.img').attr(src) this .load('ext/page.html' .element-image img.attr(src))
[03:58:43] <dblosevn> dns-away: me === lost
[03:58:57] <dns-away> any ways
[03:59:27] <dblosevn> that isnt even valid code, and i cant quite see what your trying to acomplish
[03:59:53] <dns-away> yes , I know this is a just structure of my login
[03:59:58] <dns-away> logic *
[04:01:34] <dblosevn> src isnt an attr so if your using the latest version of jquery that may be the issue your having try .prop('src', src);
[04:02:09] <xec> what?
[04:02:23] <dblosevn> src is a property, not an attribute
[04:02:29] <xec> i beg to differ
[04:02:55] <dns-away> thats true
[04:02:57] <dns-away> thanks
[04:03:04] <xec> it's not true
[04:04:01] <dns-away> i don't know
[04:04:03] <dns-away> I usnig attr
[04:04:11] <dns-away> because it work fine
[04:04:14] <dblosevn> src is not a user defined attribute, its a built-in property of img
[04:04:56] <dns-away> byt my questions is not about that .)
[04:05:26] <xec> dblosevn: it's both - what do you think an attribute would be, exactly
[04:06:10] <dns-away> attr(Jquery) also work fine
[04:06:14] <dns-away> .-)
[04:07:20] <dblosevn> i started having issues in 1.8 with some of the things i used to use attr for, i never tried with src, but a lot of the mappings that used to be made with attr to props arent made anymore
[04:07:23] <xec> dns-away: you seem even more confused than dblosevn. what are you trying to do?
[04:07:25] <BadCodSmell> What happened to the Event pseudo selector?
[04:08:02] <xec> dblosevn: yes, this is correct - but src is still an attribute (and a property) http://jsfiddle.net/jy7G7/
[04:08:34] <dblosevn> xec: i think attr should always work because in essense it is an attribute of the tag, but jquery oviously doesnt agree with me lol
[04:09:06] <_MagePsycho> dblosevn: i m usng jcaraousel
[04:09:41] <dns-away> maybe something like var mysrc = .load('ext/page #image).attr(src) then  $(something).attr(mysrc)
[04:10:13] <xec> dblosevn: essentially, properties exist writable in the DOM, while attributes are what you wrote in the html
[04:10:23] <BadCodSmell> I need this: target.closest(':Event(click)') but jquery says no.
[04:11:15] <xec> dblosevn: there are a lot of properties on dom elements that does not exist in html
[04:12:01] <dblosevn> going by the docs though, .attr will give you the attribute that was used when the tag was created, eg... img src="image.jpg" but if you change the src later via code, the prop and the attr get out of sync as seen with the checked attr
[04:13:08] <BadCodSmell> do I need :data(event.click)?
[04:13:35] <xec> BadCodSmell: i can't make sense of your code, what are you trying to do?
[04:15:27] <xec> dns-away: same goes for you, what are you trying to do?
[04:16:19] <dns-away> xec, I'll try to solve this with php
[04:18:34] <xec> o.O
[04:22:14] <leogitimate> hi, i'm having trouble trying to access jquery.com from my provider, i've tried hardcoding this ip in my hosts file : 70.32.120.34, to no avail.  is there any other ip for it?
[04:24:23] <dns-away> xec, $('.someClass image').attr('width','15px') is correct ?
[04:24:43] <xec> no, you probably want .css()
[04:25:04] <dns-away> thanks
[04:25:10] <xec> also, the selector is probably wrong ;p
[04:26:52] <dns-away> ok, how I can define image is in .someClass.
[04:27:32] <xec> dns-away: there is no <image> tag
[04:28:16] <dns-away> but that know, what I want
[04:28:20] <dns-away> work true
[04:28:27] <dns-away> :)
[04:28:45] <xec> if you're trying to match <div class="someClass"><img></div> you could do it with $(".someClass img")
[04:28:49] <dns-away> maybe~ ..
[04:28:55] <dns-away> really
[04:29:00] <dns-away> img :-) Thank you.
[04:29:23] <xec> if you're trying to match <img class="someClass"> you could do it with $("img.someClass")
[04:30:04] <dns-away> because I fetching ready images with php, Just I should change only their width, height.
[04:30:28] <dns-away> there images no have own classes
[04:32:46] <xec> speaking of classes, have you considered attending some english classes?
[04:32:48] <dns-away> but css() no work for me. I should modify image attribute
[04:33:29] <dns-away> no need
[04:33:45] <xec> yes need
[04:35:16] <dns-away> yes, css work, because I have mistake #( instead  $('
[04:35:25] <dns-away> thank you

[05:18:24] <JZA> xec: yes thats why I said this is my html code
[05:18:29] <dblosevn> JZA: id just use json_encode in php if your using php 5.3 +
[05:18:53] <dblosevn> ?g php json_encode @JZA
[05:18:54] <bot-t> JZA, PHP: json_encode - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[05:18:54] <JZA> dblosevn: I read about json_encode and got some snippet but not sure how to use it in my example
[05:19:11] <JZA> sorry through the example I saw
[05:19:47] <dblosevn> way are you using remote sources for your autocomplete?
[05:19:51] <dblosevn> *arent
[05:19:57] <xec> why*
[05:20:06] <dblosevn> that too
[05:20:07] <dblosevn> lol
[05:20:08] <xec> :D
[05:20:11] <Cork> lol
[05:20:36] <JZA> dblosevn: I have jquery.autocomplete on the header of the document yes
[05:20:39] <dblosevn> i may need sum ingles class too
[05:21:13] <Tyvara> hey guys i have a little problem: i can dynamically add a svg-element (group) to a canvas based on a type and i want to add this type to the group... if i do it like this: $('g').attr("data-element-type", id); then it works perfect for the first but if i add another one, every group gets updated with the new id... how can i say that only the newly added group should get its type-id? :S
[05:21:21] <JZA> but besides that, I want to first write the js inline and then move it as searchform.js or something like that
[05:21:28] <dblosevn> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote @ JZA
[05:21:50] <sunbeam> I'm trying to add a marker with google maps, isn't this as simple as specifying icon: "url" in the addmarker function?
[05:22:54] <JZA> oh ok, might look cleaner that way
[05:23:03] <dblosevn> might? lol
[05:23:38] <dblosevn> especially if you plan to move it to a js include you example would force it to be .js.php
[05:24:01] <dblosevn> *your whats wrong with my keyboard today
[05:24:47] <dblosevn> think i am going to order a new one I know im pressing the keys its just not registering
[05:26:41] <xec> have you tried bashing on it with a sledgehammer?
[05:26:54] <xec> it didn't work for me, but maybe it will for you :)
[05:26:56] <dblosevn> just paid 3k for the machine not gonna do that lol

[05:31:17] <NodeX> err
[05:31:22] <NodeX> no lol
[05:31:29] <NodeX> the actual value of data-id="....."
[05:31:53] <boulet101010_> o_O
[05:31:54] <Anticom> $('[data-id="..."]').data('id');
[05:32:09] <Anticom> hmm no, that won't work, will it?
[05:32:11] <NodeX> no
[05:32:20] <NodeX> and you're not understanding what I'm saying
[05:32:29] <boulet101010_> you want the value of data-id ?
[05:32:57] <boulet101010_> $("..").attr("data-id")?
[05:33:04] <Anticom> $('[data-id="..."]').map(function(v, k) { return $(v).data('id'); });
[05:33:06] <NodeX> No lol
[05:33:14] <Frosty> Hi guys.
[05:33:17] <Anticom> howdy
[05:33:18] <NodeX> <a class="foo" data-id="bar">Bar</a> <a class="foo" data-id="baz">Baz</a> ... now without using each() I want to have {bar,baz}
[05:33:28] <NodeX> more like {"bar","baz"}
[05:33:29] <Anticom> $("[data-id]")
[05:33:33] <Frosty> I need help with a page that I'm creating
[05:33:39] <NodeX> forget it
[05:33:40] <Anticom> @ NodeX
[05:33:51] <Anticom> Frosty go ahead
[05:33:53] <NodeX> that's NOT what I'm after
[05:33:58] <Anticom> it is
[05:34:04] <NodeX> No it's not
[05:34:07] <Frosty> Ok, it's a page that creates surveys...
[05:34:29] <NodeX> $("[data-id]") <--- gives me a list of jquery Objects which is NOT what I am after
[05:34:31] <Frosty> What I need to know is how I can make a button create questions on top of it
[05:34:38] <xec> NodeX: $.map() could do the job.
[05:34:52] <NodeX> map() it is then, thanks xec
[05:34:58] <NodeX> I forgot all about map()]
[05:35:10] <Frosty> I'm using Dreamweaver CS5 - php with HTML5
[05:35:37] <xec> NodeX: i am assuming you meant ["bar", "baz"] though
[05:35:42] <kavisiegel> hey guys. I'm about to submit a bug report for this - does it look like a valid bug, or should I not spend the time doing a writeup? Easy to work around, but still a bug - http://jsfiddle.net/WphwV/3/
[05:36:06] <NodeX> yeh sorry, used to Bson which allows {"bar","baz"}
[05:36:19] <NodeX> I want a json object at the end of it
[05:36:40] <xec> NodeX: so you want {"bar": "baz"} ?
[05:36:54] <xec> as in key/value pair?
[05:36:58] <NodeX> not key value
[05:37:21] <xec> so you want a json array, not a json object?
[05:37:28] <boulet101010_> Frosty: uninstall this program.
[05:37:29] <Anticom> NodeX http://jsfiddle.net/8K6Ta/
[05:37:31] <Anticom> IT IS
[05:37:34] <Anticom> -.-
[05:37:35] <NodeX> the whole thing is a Json object
[05:37:51] <NodeX> Anticom : I love how you tell me it is what I want when you dont know what I want
[05:37:55] <NodeX> it's awesome
[05:38:07] <NodeX> [13:33:20] <Anticom> $("[data-id]")
[05:38:07] <Anticom> just look at the fiddle and get happy with it
[05:38:12] <NodeX> that's what you said I wanted
[05:38:20] <NodeX> which it's not
[05:38:40] <boulet101010_> NodeX: stop raging, look at the fiddle
[05:38:58] <Anticom> Frosty look at jquery-ui's dialog
[05:38:58] <NodeX> I dont care about the fiddle, I care about being told that I want somehting I dont
[05:39:22] <boulet101010_> so just kick yourself, because it's exactly what you looked for
[05:39:29] <NodeX> Omg lol
[05:39:37] <Anticom> ty
[05:39:41] <NodeX> that fiddle is NOT the same as [13:33:20] <Anticom> $("[data-id]")
[05:39:46] <NodeX> wtf, are you blind?
[05:39:50] <JZA> I still cant get it to work :(
[05:40:02] <Anticom> i've even posted it before in here: (14:33:04)<Anticom>$('[data-id="..."]').map(function(v, k) { return $(v).data('id'); });
[05:40:04] <xec> NodeX: no need for namecalling or swearing
[05:40:22] <Anticom> (although i've messed with k,v ;) )
[05:40:26] <NodeX> xec : evidently not
[05:40:36] <xec> Anticom: $.map() is not the same as $(sel).map()
[05:40:40] <Anticom> oh hi xec, how's it going? :)
[05:40:48] <NodeX> and boom we have a winner
[05:40:50] <xec> Anticom: check out http://jsfiddle.net/8K6Ta/1/
[05:40:57] <Anticom> xec, basically it's just a different syntax for the same thing
[05:41:02] <xec> Anticom: no, it's not
[05:41:06] <Anticom> :O
[05:41:20] <Anticom> so what's the difference there?
[05:41:23] <xec> Anticom: $().map() returns a jquery collection, $.map() returns an array
[05:41:29] <NodeX> now you get why it's not what I want?
[05:41:31] <NodeX> ;)
[05:41:37] <Anticom> .toArray(), problem solved xec :P
[05:41:44] <Anticom> :D
[05:41:49] <xec> Anticom: not really
[05:41:55] <Anticom> still not?
[05:41:56] <Anticom> damn
[05:41:57] <NodeX> definatley "not really"
[05:42:01] <Frosty> Anticom, I'm a noob, what do you mean with "jquery-ui's dialog"?
[05:42:16] <xec> Anticom: that would be an array of DOM elements (not of strings)
[05:42:17] <NodeX> anyway, thank's xec - I found a quicker way to do it anyway
[05:42:22] <Anticom> Frosty http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[05:42:34] <JZA> xec: can you please look at my code autocomplete seems to just not work or maybe I have a stupid syntax error?
[05:42:50] <JZA> http://ooo.pastebin.ca/2289314
[05:42:58] <Anticom> Frosty register click-event on you'r buttons press and show the dialog there... then you can use the dialog's button callbacks to do whatever you want
[05:43:08] <JZA> xec: line 60
[05:43:16] <Anticom> JZA pls use jsfiddle instead next time
[05:43:33] <JZA> ok
[05:43:48] <Anticom> JZA u got firebug?
[05:43:59] <JZA> Anticom: yeah
[05:44:01] <Anticom> get it, and look at what your console tells you
[05:44:18] <Frosty> Anticom, what I meant was more in line with "after() Method"
[05:44:48] <Anticom> Frosty so what exactly you want? when someone clicks your button a question should pop up, right?
[05:45:39] <w00tner> if i have two js files and in both i have a $(document).ready( function() {
[05:45:42] <w00tner> does it affect ?
[05:45:59] <Frosty> No, not at all. Whe you press the button, it should be to insert a new editable question bellow the previous question but above the button itself
[05:46:34] <JZA> Anticom: it says Unhandled Error: Undefined variable: JQuery on the jquery.autocomplete.min.js
[05:46:47] <Anticom> oO
[05:46:57] <Anticom> JZA what version r u using?
[05:47:09] <JZA> this is on line 1 of the file, (function(c) {
[05:47:21] <Frosty> Lol, ok let me see if I can get a snippet of code for you as an example.
[05:47:43] <Frosty> form()
[05:48:02] <Frosty> Ignore that last one...
[05:48:05] <Frosty> :P
[05:48:19] <JZA> Anticom: not sure, it doesnt say.
[05:48:31] <JZA> Anticom: you mean of jquery.autocomplete?
[05:48:40] <Anticom> no of whole jquery lib
[05:48:51] <JZA> I have jquery-ui-1.8.18
[05:49:34] <Anticom> JZA i got 1.8.3 should work there
[05:49:48] <Anticom> you might want to check, wether it's an internal jq bug
[05:49:53] <Anticom> and upgrade ur jq version
[05:49:55] <JZA> well the error looks pretty generic.
[05:50:00] <Frosty> <script>
[05:50:03] <Frosty> function afterText()
[05:50:07] <Frosty> {
[05:50:11] <Frosty> form();
[05:50:15] <Frosty> $("img").after(form);
[05:50:21] <Frosty> }
[05:50:23] <JZA> is line 1 for (function(c) {
[05:50:25] <Frosty> </script>
[05:50:28] <Anticom> xec what's the bot's name again?

[05:51:24] <boulet101010_> ^^
[05:51:28] <Anticom> muchas gracias
[05:51:57] <Frosty> Correction: $("Button").after(form);
[05:53:31] <Frosty> Sorry: $("previous form").after(form);
[05:53:51] <Frosty> Sorry about the mess Anticom.
[05:54:57] <Frosty> But the idea is that the button is used to spawn a new form after a previous one... But the button always stays below all of the forms.

[06:10:12] <JZA> Anticom: wait, what did you do?
[06:10:20] <Anticom> negev although it's not related to jq, i'd just build an object like {Jan: 1, Feb: 2, Mar: 3, ...} and go for var number = myConversionArray[monthString];

[06:10:29] <Anticom> JZA nothing to the code
[06:10:32] <JZA> except for the whitespace
[06:10:49] <Anticom> you've got to add jquery-ui's js and jquery-ui's css files

[06:18:36] <Mickroz> how can i edit dynamicly build up element? they are not showing in source
[06:19:21] <NodeX> firebug
[06:19:28] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: lol "q-tip"
[06:19:36] <BillCriswell> It doesn't take much.
[06:20:03] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, ??
[06:20:44] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: It looks like you want bottomRight oddly enough?
[06:20:45] <Anticom> Krambiorix q-tip 1 or 2?
[06:20:48] <Mickroz> NodeX: i need to edit it with javascript or jquery, i know firebug
[06:21:02] <BillCriswell> Wow... http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/position/corner# very confusing.
[06:21:16] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, at the left of the div
[06:21:18] <Krambiorix> Anticom, 2
[06:21:27] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I know, but the documentation is weird with it.
[06:21:54] <Anticom> Krambiorix http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/position/
[06:21:59] <Krambiorix> ooow i see
[06:22:09] <Anticom> Krambiorix use my, at and target
[06:22:13] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: The L might have to be capitalized.
[06:22:38] <Krambiorix> ok let's try that
[06:22:45] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/tutorials/#position Aw yeah.
[06:23:23] <Anticom> BillCriswell that
[06:23:26] <Anticom> 's v1 docs
[06:23:38] <Anticom> i've posted the link already
[06:23:50] <Guest69102> I have a button like this <input id="someid" data_piece="some piece of data"> How can I retreive the value of data_piece and put that into a variable?
[06:23:51] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[06:23:54] <Krambiorix> hmmm but the whole qtip div should be at the left of my div
[06:24:18] <NodeX> var a =element.data('piece');
[06:24:35] <NodeX> and you must use "data-foo" -<hyphens not underscoers
[06:24:40] <Anticom> Guest21470 if you want to use html5's data it's got to be data-piece instead of data_piece... if you do so, you can access it using .data('piece'), otherwise you'd have to use .attr('data_piece')

[06:24:59] <Guest69102> Ahh, sweet. Thank you.
[06:25:03] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: In that case, what Anticom said lol.
[06:25:18] <Krambiorix> lol
[06:25:19] <BillCriswell> That's a pretty radical change.
[06:25:22] <NodeX> for html5 data then yes he does as the whole point is to stop circular memory leaks
[06:25:52] <Anticom> agree :P
[06:26:36] <BillCriswell> I love that I need to get into work early before my boss so I can actually get things done.
[06:26:41] <Anticom> oh btw does anyone know, what happened to pines notify webpage?
[06:27:20] <Anticom> is it just like temporary or has it been shut down permanently?
[06:28:36] <Krambiorix> Anticom, BillCriswell -->  target: 'topRight',tooltip: 'topRight',  at:'bottom left' still shows the qtip at the right side of my div....
[06:29:50] <Anticom> Krambiorix i already said it, and if you would read the docs you should get it from there too.... target has to specify a dom element. e.g. $('div#mydiv')
[06:30:34] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: If you don't read the docs you'll drive yourself and everyone else insane haha.
[06:30:56] <Anticom> my: 'right', at: 'left', target: $('#mydiv')
[06:31:20] <Krambiorix> ow hell
[06:31:26] <Anticom> right center, left center*
[06:31:47] <Anticom> oh btw... target should be optional... you can leave that out i think
[06:31:56] <Krambiorix> Anticom, BillCriswell you guys have to communicate clearer
[06:31:57] <Krambiorix> :p
[06:31:59] <Krambiorix> :D
[06:32:04] <Anticom> Krambiorix  just go for my: 'right center', at: 'left center'
[06:32:26] <Anticom> Krambiorix it's very easy... ignore what BillCriswell says and only listen to me ;)
[06:32:28] <Anticom> :D
[06:32:49] <Krambiorix> lol
[06:32:54] <Anticom> jk
[06:33:08] <Anticom> but seriously... go for the config i told you some lines ago
[06:33:19] <BillCriswell> Anticom: If you want to get anywhere with web development, you should definitely follow Anticom's advice.
[06:33:20] <Krambiorix> yes , trying that now
[06:33:29] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: *
[06:33:32] <Anticom> i know the positioning system of qtip is a little confusing but once you get it it realy makes sense
[06:33:44] <Krambiorix> Anticom,  my: 'right center', at: 'left center' --> still at the right of my div
[06:33:49] <BillCriswell> It's "heavily based on" this: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position
[06:33:53] <Anticom> DAFUQ
[06:34:12] <Anticom> okay qtip sucks :D
[06:34:14] <Anticom> hahaha
[06:34:36] <Krambiorix> ow hell
[06:35:08] <Anticom> reload using CTRL + SHIFT + R to make sure you're not consuming cached crap
[06:35:25] <Krambiorix> Anticom, is that the same as CTRL + F5 ?
[06:35:28] <Anticom> i don't know why that happens sometimes, but my ff somtimes likes to bug me with that
[06:35:34] <BillCriswell> position: { my: "left top", at: "left top", of: "#targetElement" } almost reads like a sentence. I love that.
[06:35:35] <Anticom> Krambiorix think so
[06:35:35] <Anticom> yea

[06:40:02] <aqeel> hi room
[06:41:51] <aqeel> i have two plugins, aautoscroll and tiny scrollbar and am trying to have it merged....
[06:42:09] <aqeel> can some one help me as i have manage to do some bits and pieces...
[06:42:27] <mandarks> hey guys, anybody know howto user on mouseleave as a callback for on hover
[06:43:08] <aqeel> aautoscrollbar have been edited by me to support jquery 1.8 and remove all dependencies
[06:43:29] <aqeel> and as for tiny scrollbar here it is...http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/
[06:43:38] <aqeel> i am trying to combine the two..
[06:43:58] <BillCriswell> mandarks: You want to trigger the mouseleave event inside a mouseover?
[06:44:47] <aqeel> hover(mouseenter,mouseleave)
[06:45:07] <shankey> hey I am trying to load a carousel when click on a link via ajax call which loads carousel from individual html page
[06:45:08] <mandarks> BillCriswell: correct
[06:45:37] <Anticom> re
[06:45:45] <BillCriswell> mouseout, sorry.
[06:45:50] <shankey> how can i load carousel from another html via ajax
[06:45:52] <aqeel> hover(function(){/*mouseenter*/},function(){/*mouseleave*/});
[06:46:21] <BillCriswell> If you want to do the same thing in both you can do $('el').on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(){ // Whatever });
[06:46:32] <Anticom> just in theory... is it possible to register key events, before the dom is ready to be manipulated? i've got a php script constantly streaming output and i want to enable some kind of auto-scroll feature
[06:46:49] <mandarks> aqeel: the only thing is i need to use an on('hover'
[06:47:05] <aqeel> yes but hover is 2 states
[06:47:19] <aqeel> either same for both or on and off
[06:47:20] <BillCriswell> mandarks: You can also do $(this).trigger('mouseout') instead the over.
[06:47:25] <BillCriswell> hover*
[06:47:28] <shankey> Anticom: Hi can u help me on this to load a dynamic carousel from html using ajax
[06:47:36] <BillCriswell> mandarks: It sounds confusing though.
[06:47:59] <mandarks> heres my block
[06:48:04] <mandarks> 		   $("body").on('hover', "*", function(ev) {
[06:48:06] <mandarks> 				ev.stopImmediatePropagation();
[06:48:07] <mandarks> 				$('.hoverAction').removeClass('hoverAction');		   	 	
[06:48:09] <mandarks> 		   		if(elementSelector == true && inCommentMode == false){
[06:48:11] <mandarks> 					if(typeof $(this).hasParent('[ignore]').html() === 'undefined'){
[06:48:13] <mandarks> 						$(this).addClass('hoverAction');
[06:48:14] <mandarks> 					}
[06:48:16] <mandarks> 		        	return false;
[06:48:16] <Anticom> STOP IT
[06:48:17] <mandarks> 		       	}	
[06:48:18] <tra> stop
[06:48:19] <mandarks> 		   })
[06:48:21] <BillCriswell> mandarks: Use a paste service.
[06:48:22] <danzik17> mandarks: please use jsfiddle.  don't paste code here.
[06:48:23] <Anticom>  ?demo
[06:48:28] <Anticom> argh my irc client won't let my
[06:48:30] <mandarks> sorry
[06:48:30] <Anticom> me*
[06:48:47] <Anticom> shankey howdy... so what carousel r u using?
[06:48:53] <Anticom> mandarks use jsfiddle.net
[06:49:12] <shankey> bootstrap
[06:49:49] <Anticom> shankey link?!
[06:49:51] <Anticom> ._.
[06:50:37] <shankey> Anticom: http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/dynamic_ajax.html this is using links to load url of image
[06:50:51] <mandarks> http://jsfiddle.net/sEwbW/
[06:50:53] <shankey> Anticom: but i need to load it from html
[06:51:29] <Anticom> what do you mean by loading it from html?
[06:52:19] <shankey> Anticom: in the link it is using a plain text file which contains urls
[06:52:21] <BillCriswell> mandarks: Using hover is deprecated.
[06:52:22] <Anticom> mandarks so what is your problem there?
[06:52:48] <hlve[workaholic]> =)
[06:52:58] <shankey> Anticom: ok this is my problem statement  Each navigation link has a corresponding carousel, that have to be individual HTML's which get called thru ajax on click of the navigation links. [the carousel on screen is for the 1st link - Distinguished Tech Program, the other 3 carousels will be html's called thru ajax on using the navigation links on the left.]
[06:53:31] <Anticom> what?!
[06:53:38] <Anticom> sorry my brain isn't working properly today
[06:53:44] <mandarks> Anticom: Whenever I hover hover nested elements, i find and then out one level.. it doesn't seem to be reapplying the hover state class unless i totally leave the element
[06:53:47] <Anticom> so you're using this carousel plugin
[06:53:52] <mandarks> *over
[06:53:57] <shankey> Anticom: :) yes
[06:54:11] <Anticom> mandarks try mousemove
[06:54:28] <Anticom> shankey and you got links pointing where?
[06:54:53] <Anticom> to webpages and you want to extract the images and display them when clicking on the links?
[06:55:46] <mandarks> mouse move fixes that nicely, thanks
[06:56:05] <Anticom> mandarks welcome
[06:56:30] <DanYWalker> hi guys, i have a problem
[06:56:53] <Anticom> haha me too. i'm still @work :D
[06:56:55] <shankey> Anticom: ok i have a left side bar which has 4 links which has there own individual html pages having carousels . so when i click on any of the link requirement is to load corresponding crousel in the container div
[06:57:00] <mandarks> loool
[06:57:40] <Anticom> shankey and the carousels are completly done on the individual html pages?
[06:58:11] <shankey> yes
[06:58:14] <DanYWalker> i load a page with a $.ajax() , all ok, but when y load in a div who must refresh every 10 seconds(to refresh the grid like gmail). I load another data in the same grid, then before 10 seconds load the back data
[06:58:15] <DanYWalker> why?
[06:58:21] <Anticom> shankey well then you've got to register a click-handler on the links stopping the eventPropagation. then get the html via ajax call and set the div's html to what you're getting back
[06:58:58] <BillCriswell> shankey: You'll also have to get the CSS if you haven't loaded it.
[06:59:18] <BillCriswell> Then you'll have to load the JavaScript.
[06:59:36] <Shado> Hi, I have some questions about Jquerry, can someone helps me?
[06:59:42] <BillCriswell> DanYWalker: Was that a riddle?
[07:00:02] <shankey> how can i load the whole content of html page in another html do i need to use iframe for that
[07:00:07] <aqeel> Shado: shoot your questions
[07:00:28] <BillCriswell> shankey: $('.foo').load('/bar.html')
[07:00:38] <aqeel> not necessary any element can do..... shankey
[07:00:52] <shankey> BillCriswell: but it is mentioned i need to use ajax call for it
[07:01:01] <aqeel> .load is ajax
[07:01:05] <BillCriswell> shankey: That is technically an ajax call.
[07:01:22] <shankey> BillCriswell: this is the problem statement .) Each navigation link has a corresponding carousel, that have to be individual HTML's which get called thru ajax on click of the navigation links. [the carousel on screen is for the 1st link - Distinguished Tech Program, the other 3 carousels will be html's called thru ajax on using the navigation links on the left.]
[07:01:29] <Shado> First of all I must tell you i'm french, so my english may be not ok. A friend of mine is actually building a website and wanted to know if he can use JQuery legaly. I mean does he get the right to use it, is it free-to use? (know what I mean?)
[07:01:33] <BillCriswell> It's basically $.get('bar.html', function(r){ $('.foo').html(r); });
[07:01:56] <BillCriswell> Shado: totally free.
[07:02:31] <Anticom> shankey you could use on
[07:02:31] <Shado> So my friend won't have problem with some kind of royalties or with law, using this program to help him code his website?
[07:02:35] <Anticom> just let me finish my fiddle
[07:02:44] <BillCriswell> Shado: No.
[07:02:49] <R00tk3y> wut up room
[07:02:57] <BillCriswell> Shado: He can use it however he'd like.
[07:03:01] <Shado> thx a lot! I go tell him
[07:03:07] <shankey> Anticom: :)
[07:03:08] <NodeX> Shado : your friend MUST include a copy of the licenese iirc
[07:03:13] <NodeX> or a link to it
[07:03:16] <BillCriswell> Shado: http://jquery.org/license/
[07:03:20] <NodeX> ^^
[07:03:21] <R00tk3y> ok

[07:03:34] <hlve[workaholic]> :/
[07:03:46] <Shado> Nodex : how must he do that?
[07:04:11] <hlve[workaholic]> let's be fair here
[07:04:20] <hlve[workaholic]> a lot of people don't include the license
[07:04:20] <BillCriswell> Shado: It's already in there more than likely. Don't worry about it. Go have fun!
[07:04:21] <hlve[workaholic]> lol
[07:04:33] <NodeX> it's normaly included in the file
[07:04:52] <Shado> I'm afraid my english isn't good enough to understand..
[07:04:59] <hlve[workaholic]> ._.
[07:05:08] <Shado> (plus the fact i don't understand anything in coding :p)
[07:05:16] <BillCriswell> This is at the top, so you're good: /*! jQuery v1.8.3 jquery.com | jquery.org/license */
[07:05:28] <BillCriswell> Shado: Go tell friend to code.
[07:05:51] <aqeel> shado http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js
[07:05:59] <Shado> what's about "including the license" ?
[07:06:02] <R00tk3y> DWORD* shado = ((DWORD)*)lolbro;
[07:06:07] <aqeel> top comment leads to liceensce
[07:06:32] <R00tk3y> Shado you don't need a license to use jQuery
[07:06:36] <shankey> Anticom: you there?
[07:06:38] <R00tk3y> Just use it, your not going to be sued ffs
[07:06:45] <Anticom> shankey um lol... ther's nothing in the output: http://jsfiddle.net/xtufQ/

[07:10:05] <shankey> Anticom: can i have your email id so that i can send u the actual problem statement and code that i made
[07:10:07] <Anticom> shankey i thought, the carousel was loaded via the html from the other page?
[07:10:08] <shoky> i think you'd be surprised ;p
[07:10:11] <R00tk3y>  Alexa Traffic Rank: 23,472 United States Flag Traffic Rank in US: 12,899
[07:10:18] <BillCriswell> I want to create the "copyright footer".
[07:10:19] <R00tk3y> what the fu--

[07:10:51] <R00tk3y> "HEY THERE, DUDE YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT THIS RANDOM ADVERTISMENT, ITS COOL, AND ITS MAKES US MONEY!"
[07:10:52] <shoky> you'd probably be too late ;]
[07:11:09] <BillCriswell> shoky: you took my idea that quick?!
[07:11:11] <aqeel> guys i need penetration help
[07:11:12] <R00tk3y> On porn sites they always have the ads in the middle of the video
[07:11:15] <shoky> hehh
[07:11:17] <shankey> Anticom: ?
[07:11:18] <R00tk3y> aqeel SQL?
[07:11:27] <shoky> aqeel that sounds nasty
[07:11:28] <aqeel> no two plugins
[07:11:35] <R00tk3y> Security penetration?
[07:12:05] <R00tk3y> This hellobar site needs to go.
[07:12:09] <aqeel> no penetrate into the coding of these two plugins and come up with universal functional plugin
[07:12:18] <R00tk3y> Uhh what?
[07:12:22] <mdedetrich> hey my slidedown effects are failing on an absolutely positioned div
[07:12:29] <mdedetrich> anyone have any idea how this is being caused?
[07:12:41] <R00tk3y> Yeah mdede
[07:12:44] <BillCriswell> R00tk3y: I mean, to each their own. I just feel like it's robbery. They do provide analytics and stuff but still..
[07:12:46] <R00tk3y> Use animate instead
[07:12:56] <Anticom> shankey http://jsfiddle.net/xtufQ/4/
[07:13:01] <Anticom> that's all i'm gonna do for ya
[07:13:13] <hlve[workaholic]> why do i feel R00tk3y is in here solely to troll all of us
[07:13:16] <hlve[workaholic]> lol
[07:13:20] <shoky> how is it robbery if you dont have to pay :\
[07:13:30] <BillCriswell> Well, IF you choose to pay haha.
[07:13:33] <R00tk3y> Sorry mdede, thats not the correct function
[07:13:37] <shoky> then you rob yourself
[07:13:42] <mdedetrich> this only started happening when I made the div absolute (something I had no choice over)
[07:13:57] <BillCriswell> shoky: I guess robbery is the wrong word... How about scam?
[07:14:07] <shoky> i don't see it as scam either
[07:14:26] <shankey> Anticom: really thanks a lot for your time its really very important for me
[07:14:29] <shoky> i dont really have  aproblem with that site ;)
[07:14:36] <R00tk3y> Mdede, post code

[07:16:08] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Are you recreating the marqee tag?
[07:16:09] <R00tk3y> Evasivx i cant believe you
[07:16:10] <shoky> is that they say its a site for 'developers' :P
[07:16:18] <aqeel> nope
[07:16:22] <R00tk3y> Evasivx NEVER EVER EVER pay for "Code Made in India"
[07:16:40] <shoky> and calling someone who needs to use such a service a developer is evil
[07:16:41] <shankey> Anticom: i can understand that still really thanks for your help :)
[07:16:47] <BillCriswell> evasivx: http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[07:16:55] <Anticom> no problem
[07:16:57] <evasivx> R00tk3y, hahaha, I'm sure you're probably right about the source of most code canyon stuff
[07:17:07] <R00tk3y> Yeah
[07:17:07] <BillCriswell> evasivx: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[07:17:13] <R00tk3y> And the india guys, they come in here and ask us lol
[07:17:30] <aqeel> if you see the source you might get the idea what i am talking about
[07:17:34] <evasivx> R00tk3y, :P you must all be flattered then...right??
[07:17:43] <R00tk3y> No, we help them ofcourse
[07:18:04] <dan2k3k4> how would I 'execute' some JQuery for a specific div? if I do <div id="s"></div> <script>myScript</script> - then it works, but if I move the script above the <div> (to place in head) then it stops working
[07:18:18] <shoky> having facebook and twitter icons on every single webpage on the interwebs, now that's evil.
[07:18:27] <Pilate> dan2k3k4: wait for the page load event
[07:18:31] <R00tk3y> dan2k3k4, spelling your name out takes more time than answering your question
[07:18:37] <aqeel> use documnet onload.....are you using jquery or javascript
[07:18:39] <evasivx> shoky, every wordpress site ever
[07:18:55] <shoky> much more than that, i'm sure
[07:19:14] <dan2k3k4> Pilate: can I add multiple calls to the page load event?
[07:19:16] <aqeel> dan2k3k4: are you using jquery ?
[07:19:48] <dan2k3k4> aqeel: yes (though for my simple example, that's just js)
[07:20:16] <R00tk3y> Dan, are you from China?
[07:20:25] <aqeel> wrap your MyScript in $(function(){}); nd put in your head section
[07:21:07] <aqeel> js will foloow the flow, if you call stuf before execution of things then they will miss and nothing seems to work
[07:21:10] <R00tk3y> Dan2k, you need to use document.ready
[07:21:22] <dan2k3k4> I tried with document.ready :(
[07:21:31] <R00tk3y> $(document).ready(function() { <INSERT CHINA CODE> });
[07:21:33] <aqeel> jsfiddle?
[07:21:37] <dan2k3k4> $(document).ready(function() {}
[07:21:42] <R00tk3y> Wrong
[07:21:51] <R00tk3y> $(document).ready(function() {} );
[07:22:07] <BillCriswell> (function(){ ... }); is the same thing.
[07:22:23] <R00tk3y> Yeah, but this guy might go insane if he has to try to understand what that does
[07:23:00] <R00tk3y> If its obviously his first day free lancing.
[07:23:02] <evasivx> '
[07:23:05] <evasivx> insane in the membrane
[07:23:42] <R00tk3y> So who here is a web designer, i don't mean that HTML and css shit, i mean actuall photoshoper?
[07:24:10] <aqeel> dan2k3k4: $(function(){ alert('i didi it');});     just put this and see if it works
[07:24:31] <R00tk3y> Aqeel you should of told him to use console.log, he would never KNOW lol
[07:24:40] <BillCriswell> R00tk3y: I try to not be that guy, but it happens sometimes.
[07:24:59] <R00tk3y> Bill, I am web designer, i do the sql, php, jquery html/css
[07:25:00] <aqeel> i rather doubt if he even knows about console and logging stuff
[07:25:03] <R00tk3y> err, myself is easy
[07:25:07] <R00tk3y> my life*
[07:25:52] <firstclassfunc> I'm using requirejs (already asked in their channel) and my requirejs.config() call takes too long (it's located inside of main.js), so my require call inside a script tag always times out. If I move the require.config() call into the script tag also, I get no timeout errors.

[07:36:50] <R00tk3y> lol
[07:37:20] <shoky> wat
[07:37:23] <warbler> Would anyone happen to know of that WP Super Popup, but for websites?
[07:37:26] <BillCriswell> Why is that funny?
[07:37:35] <R00tk3y> Its not
[07:37:40] <warbler> I need to use it on pointstackers.com for stuff like news, new offers, etc
[07:37:44] <R00tk3y> Its very inspiring
[07:37:52] <BillCriswell> "Super Popup" sounds like nightmare material.
[07:37:55] <warbler> hey shoky good morning =)
[07:38:02] <warbler> BillCriswell it's just a jquery overlay
[07:38:05] <shoky> ey warbler
[07:38:16] <R00tk3y> warbler like the facebook overlay
[07:38:17] <R00tk3y> ?
[07:38:26] <warbler> R00tk3y yes similar to that I suppose
[07:38:31] <R00tk3y> Look up lightbox
[07:38:39] <warbler> im on it, thanks
[07:38:42] <R00tk3y> np
[07:39:11] <mdedetrich> shoky: I almost got it, it seems I need to use top/bottom and it works
[07:39:52] <warbler> I'm like 3 days into jQuery and im falling in love with it
[07:40:03] <warbler> doing as much as I can for my rewards site pointstackers.com =)
[07:40:10] <warbler> any suggestions would be most welcome! :D
[07:40:40] <R00tk3y> Warbler, hows that working for ya pal?
[07:40:48] <warbler> its working well so far
[07:40:54] <R00tk3y> A lot of traffic?
[07:40:57] <warbler> i havent even BEGUN to drive traffic to it yet
[07:41:09] <R00tk3y> I used to run a PTC to site
[07:41:12] <warbler> i have around 30k uniques perday on my 50+ other wordpress gaming related websites
[07:41:35] <warbler> I figure when i fiinish up pointstackers ill setup SuperPopup on all my WP sites to advertise pointstackers
[07:41:37] <R00tk3y> Oh you have like blog thats you use to drive traffic to the pointstackers?
[07:41:48] <R00tk3y> Yeah thats good idea
[07:42:11] <R00tk3y> Then just use php
[07:42:20] <R00tk3y> to include it inside of the blogger header.php
[07:42:24] <DrDank> Just wondering.. when downloading jquery examples/demos.. --- is it important to get the css file?? or just code your own css into your site/page? ex. jquery site has /resources/style.css or something.. -- just not worry about that and code my own css into it? (using their css template?)
[07:43:07] <R00tk3y> Warbler, btw how much monet you making from the site
[07:43:08] <shoky> DrDank: jquery itself doesnt need any special css
[07:43:19] <R00tk3y> DrDrank, yes sometimes it can be important
[07:43:22] <warbler> probably around $50/day
[07:43:22] <shoky> DrDank: jquery UI needs the jquery UI css
[07:43:32] <R00tk3y> Well thats good, keep up the good work
[07:43:39] <warbler> purely organic traffic with no advertisements yet
[07:43:56] <warbler> i have to sign up with more affiliate companies
[07:44:02] <warbler> to offer users more ways to comp;lete offers
[07:44:10] <DrDank> Alright, thanks.. first timer. :-x
[07:44:22] <BillCriswell> i really need a dedicated IE8 machine. BrowserStack isn't cutting it today.
[07:44:22] <warbler> just a bit confusing because all of their SQL exports do not match my database structure
[07:44:34] <R00tk3y> Warbler, SQL exports for what
[07:44:51] <warbler> to populate the 'surveys' section
[07:45:42] <Timmeh> so, you guys have a good day, and take good care of kentaromiura and arian
[07:47:03] <AL13N_work> say, is it possible in javascript/jquery to get the value of a parameter that might be set in the url?
[07:47:20] <AL13N_work> ie: a ?page=x parameter
[07:47:23] <kentaromiura> yes sir
[07:47:47] <AL13N_work> crossbrowser of course
[07:47:56] <kentaromiura> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.location
[07:47:58] <aqeel> anything that is html and or css, javascript and jquery can grab it
[07:49:05] <matteu> AL13N_work:  I would take a look at jQuery URL Praser, http://allmarkedup.com/post/27695941846/jquery-url-parser-v2-0
[07:56:13] <Reflow> anybody there?
[07:56:20] <lazaros> hello, i have a form here which updated the custom field value of a post in wordpress from the front end, how can we use ajax so that it doesn't the page, and just saves and shows the output or next action, here is the code sir http://pastebin.com/cCz0QnR9
[07:59:25] <William|i7> anyone know of a jquery plugin site you can submit a new plugin to?
[07:59:31] <William|i7> or possibly some tips to advertise a new plugin
[08:00:00] <William|i7> i created a jquery ui live chat plugin/app @ http://juichat.com/ and am having a hard time finding a good way to promote it
[08:00:12] <William|i7> most plugins on the web are on some authors website that is already established
[08:00:45] <lazaros> William, this is not an internet marketing chat
[08:01:01] <lazaros> but i would suggest you try out the million jquery forums out there
[08:01:15] <lazaros> keep your site in the signature, help people make them visit you site
[08:01:42] <William|i7> but there is not an alternative plugin site? i know of jqueryplugins.com but there is no submission button
[08:02:02] <docmur> Are there any good dropdown style libraries like select2 and chosen, I've had issue getting either to work correectly
[08:02:02] <William|i7> and jquerys plugins site is still offline
[08:02:06] <lazaros> contact the site through contact form ?
[08:02:37] <William|i7> there isnt one
[08:02:53] <William|i7> docmur to convert an existing select list to a css drop down or what?
[08:03:35] <docmur> yep sorry, should of been more clear.  I want to take my existing select boxes and change the look and feel of them to something more streamed line or facebook style
[08:03:50] <William|i7> docmur i like gentleselect
[08:03:56] <William|i7> i use it on a fairly large project
[08:04:04] <William|i7> http://shawnchin.github.com/jquery-gentleSelect/
[08:04:12] <DrDank> one more lame question.. When you download a jQuery plugin... how do you know if its jQuery UI or just regular jQuery?
[08:04:50] <William|i7> DrDank maybe you can look at the code for refrence to ui features
[08:05:10] <NodeX> normaly they have a header with a depends section
[08:05:12] <William|i7> or see if it links to the ui css/js or include sit
[08:05:33] <William|i7> NodeX do you have an example of that?
[08:05:39] <NodeX> sorry no
[08:05:56] <DrDank> and if it doesnt its just regular jQuery? --- and that does NOT need a style sheet?? --- Im trying to work with 'Slideouts' and I dont see how it can be done without a style sheet.
[08:07:43] <William|i7> DrDank i would suspect a slide out needs a css file
[08:07:54] <firstclassfunc> are scripts loaded synchronously on a page by default?
[08:09:06] <DrDank> Uhm, I guess Ill try it with just the regular css file from jquery.com.. --- it didnt come with any documentation or anything.. blah.. :-\ Im going to have to google a tutorial or something
[08:09:24] <William|i7> DrDank whats the plugin youre using?
[08:13:03] <w00nzs> do you know any technique to just capture a a bunch of divs within another one? i have this div where you can drop  images and text contained in a layer
[08:13:12] <w00nzs> when the user is done customizing it
[08:13:28] <w00nzs> is there any way to just capture the whole area
[08:13:50] <kreature> jQuery Mobile is adding some classes when I click a button. I want to find out which classes get applied but I goes by so fast that I can't see
[08:14:00] <kreature> is there any sane way to track the addition/removal of classes?
[08:14:57] <DrDank> Slideouts is all I know so far.
[08:15:06] <DrDank> 'slideout tips'
[08:15:30] <William|i7> http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/04/slideout-context-tips-jquery-css3/demo.html
[08:15:32] <William|i7> ?
[08:15:50] * William|i7 dunno
[08:15:54] <alexparker> Hey i have found that if you create a custom event inside a $(document).ready(function(){ /*context*/ }); that binding is not available elsewhere - is that default behavior? or should i be looking for something i might have done wrong
[08:15:59] <DrDank> Yeah, thats it.... but thats not where I got it from...
[08:16:10] <DrDank> thanks William|i7, you the man! :)
[08:16:25] <William|i7> youre welcome
[08:16:31] <William|i7> css is on the main example page
[08:16:31] <DrDank> Now, if you coud help me get my first jQuery experince working.. you would really be the man! lol lol
[08:16:34] <William|i7> http://tutorialzine.com/2010/04/slideout-context-tips-jquery-css3/
[08:16:36] * DrDank -> first timer.
[08:16:42] * William|i7 old timer
[08:17:02] <William|i7> but ofc been coding long before jquery was around
[08:18:17] <alexparker> why can't i call $(document).trigger('custom.event'); in a separate $(document).ready(function(){ than it is defined?
[08:18:22] <William|i7> alexparker i suspect you may try to use whatevers in there before the document is ready
[08:18:52] <William|i7> so if your function only exist when the doc is ready
[08:19:01] <William|i7> but you want to call it before that statement
[08:19:02] <William|i7> it wont work
[08:19:30] <alexparker> William|i7: that's what one might guess, but it's actually getting called inside a different event
[08:19:34] <alexparker> a click
[08:23:59] <alexparker> ok i think something else is wrong, i just fiddled it and it seems to work, so back to the code grr
[08:30:29] <DrDank> William|i7, when I load the CSS file (from slideout tips) --- it messes up my design on the page.. Any way to fix this.. ?
[08:38:50] <William|i7> DrDank maybe you have some conflicts with their css
[08:39:28] <William|i7> the only think that looks like it would conflict is this:
[08:39:28] <William|i7> .main > p{ display:none; }
[08:39:35] <William|i7> is you have a class thats .main with a paragraph
[08:39:45] <William|i7> but itd be hard to speculate beyond that
[08:40:17] <DrDank> I done cleared it out.. Im thinking I need to go with a dialog anyways (sign up form) for a news letter for our lawn mower racing track. -
[08:40:21] <firstclassfunc> index.html has three scripts: jquery, init, and main. init loads several scripts with $.ajax({..., async:false}). will all these scripts be loaded by time main (the third script on the page) is run?
[08:42:45] <William|i7> firstclassfunc i dont think there is any guarentee of that
[08:43:05] <William|i7> only way to make sure that occurs is by doing code in the ajax's success
[08:43:31] <William|i7> ajax -> success > ajax -> succces -> ajax success -> main
[08:43:57] <William|i7> but im not 100% positive as i dont typically not do async requests
[08:44:15] <firstclassfunc> William|i7: yeah, I was just curious
[08:49:49] <ShooterMG> Would anybody be willing to look at this tiny pastebin and tell me why that .first() call fails? (can't call method first() on Object #<Object>)  http://pastebin.com/6mJYUPC0
[08:50:55] <eydaimon> I've got an on('change') event added to an element which comes into exitence on a user action. But I actually want to trigger it when it is first loaded, not just when the selector (in this case) is changed. I've tried on('load' but to no avail. How can I trigger when the item is loaded?
[08:51:43] <eydaimon> ShooterMG: does it work to access it with [0] instead of first?
[08:52:03] <ShooterMG> hmm lemme check
[08:53:27] <ejo> eydaimon: your question is almost answerable but still needs more specificity IMO... it's still not easy to interpret exactly what you're saying, either the problem statement or desired outcome.  Perhaps a long version in a pastebin?
[08:54:04] <ejo> i mean it's close but still requires a lot of guessing/interpretation at this point
[08:55:12] <eydaimon> ejo: thanks. I'll try to clarify. The user clicks 'add to cart' and an item is loaded (which color does the buyer want) and there's a selection option. Some options are invalid however. I can check the selection on change, btu I can't seem to attach anything to the selector on first load. Does that make sense?
[08:55:33] <ejo> can you clarify what you mean exactly by "an item is loaded"
[08:55:33] <morfin> hello
[08:56:14] <ejo> eydaimon: by "item is loaded" some people would mean it is fetched from the server via AJAX, others would mean just the act of inserting the item into the DOM for the first time, etc
[08:56:24] <eydaimon> ejo: when you click 'add to cart' I send an ajax call to figure out which options. This works fine:  $('body').on('change', 'select.option', (event)
[08:56:31] <ejo> also when you say "there's a selection option" you mean it's part of the 'item'?
[08:56:36] <ejo> mm ok that helps
[08:56:51] <eydaimon> (coffee-script )
[08:56:56] <morfin> why can this break: for(key in fields_dependencies_local) { ... } keys looks like "custom[somefield]"
[08:57:17] <morfin> when i try to do fields_dependencies_local[key] it says it's undefined
[08:57:51] <eydaimon> ejo: the problem is the default select option is invalid, but I can only seem to do the check on('change' as opposed to trigger the check when the select option first appears.
[08:58:04] <eydaimon> ejo: sorry that i"m having trouble explaining clearly :/
[08:58:19] <ejo> eydaimon: seems to me you need some action, X, to occur, and you are wanting it to happen when that data is fetched from the server via AJAX.  Since you know (if I'm not mistaken) exactly WHEN you want X to happen, why not just program it to happen in the success callback of the AJAX call (or similar location) rather than trying to make part of the event system fire it?
[08:58:37] <marc_v92> I just upgraded from Cycle to Cycle2, and I've changed one of my slideshows to use the HTML tag declarations as opposed to defining my slideshow in a script...but I can't seem to find the "fit" option in Cycle2...am I missing it, or is it not there?
[08:58:58] <ejo> eydaimon: events are more for things where you can't possibly know in advance /when/ they should occur, but this doesn't seem to be a case of that.
[08:58:59] <eydaimon> ejo: hm. you're right. that may work well.
[08:59:33] <ejo> eydaimon: i'm often tempted to wire everything into events too (curses upon the coolness of jQuery leading us to try everything!) but you gotta draw a line somewhere
[09:00:20] <eydaimon> ejo: :)
[09:00:28] <ejo> marc_v92: not sure what the % chance may be of current audience being fully versed in Cycle2... how about a link to its docs?
[09:00:46] <marc_v92> ejo: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/
[09:00:58] <ejo> :)
[09:01:28] <marc_v92> Cycle2 still supports Cycle, but unfortunately the slideshow I've working with needs to leverage some of Cycle2's new features, and you can't use Cycle and Cycle2 on the same page.
[09:01:42] <ejo> morfin: are you using a good js debugger like Chrome Dev Tools or Firebug?  If so I'm sure you can trace through that one pretty quickly
[09:02:13] <ejo> morfin: in any case doesn't sound like a jQuery question but a ##javascript question
[09:02:39] <eydaimon> ejo: ok, looked at the code. The problem is the ajax call loads the select option, but at that time I don't have a target :/
[09:02:43] <ejo> darn... the Cycle2 author lost me at misspelling "versatile" in the 1st line :|
[09:03:16] <eydaimon> ejo: at least with the event I can use the target: http://pastie.org/5479703
[09:03:40] <ejo> eydaimon: ok... but don't you have any other way to reach the DOM element on which you need to operate?
[09:04:14] <ejo> Cycle2 does look nice though :)  reading on...
[09:04:36] <eydaimon> ejo: looks like it's a new sibling element in the DOM
[09:04:49] <eydaimon> ejo: so I guess yes :P
[09:05:04] <ejo> hooray
[09:10:45] <ejo> marc_v92:  seems like Cycle2's "auto-height" option should get you pretty close, possibly with a little helper code and/or its ability to specify a ratio?
[09:12:30] <eydaimon> ejo: crossing fingers for this: $(this).next().trigger('change')  since it's a sibling element
[09:13:26] <eydaimon> hmm
[09:14:49] <ejo> eydaimon: make sure you're staying fully aware of asynchronous stuff when dealing with that
[09:15:29] <ejo> like what needs to be done in a callback (etc) since all ajax operations are usually handed off to async and your script goes on regardless of how they turn out
[09:15:57] * ejo could possibly help more with a more complete pastebin
[09:19:02] <hariom> how to clear cached data like text box entries
[09:20:29] <hariom> if i revisit the same page abain, i don,t want see text boxes filled with previous values
[09:21:16] <hlve[workaholic]> á¶˜ áµ’á´¥áµ’á¶…
[09:21:33] <hariom> how to clear cached data like text box entries
[09:22:44] <ejo> hariom: IIRC that's browser-dependent
[09:23:18] <ejo> you may be able to script it but might have to call browser-specific code?  but I know nothing more about it
[09:24:04] <slite> hariom: basicly say that the browser can't cache the page content in any way
[09:24:34] <katsh> when the user has a select file dialog open, how do i detect which button was clicked? (open, cancel)
[09:25:24] <ejo> katsh, if you have the click event, it would be event.target
[09:25:34] <hariom> slite: then from where the old values appear in the text boxes when i revisit the page again
[09:25:43] <ejo> sorry nvm, misread question
[09:25:54] <katsh> okay

[09:26:29] <hlve[workaholic]> ooops wrong chan
[09:57:10] <DrDank> ugh!! --- this is starting to irk me.. --- using 'simple modal 1.4.3' --- ericmmartin.com --- Ive got the CSS and ALL the scripts loaded.. ---> using <a href="#" class="basic">Demo</a> (as it shows in the demo) and I get a big fat nothing... can someone help?
[10:00:30] <Guest21584> have something to look at?
[10:01:10] <DrDank> Guest21584, ?
[10:01:43] <Guest21584> testsite, fiddle something that illustrates your error?
[10:03:46] <DrDank> there is no error.. I copied and paste the whole thing. only thing I didnt do was 'demo.css' I used the other two basic.css and basic_ie.css.. (demo.css) was messing up my layout.. conflicting I guess.. --- it was so easy in the demo. <a href="#" class="basic">click</a> would display the dialog --- that just isnt working once i got it all setup in my web folder.. --- yes all the scripts are
[10:03:46] <DrDank> embeded.
[10:07:01] <DrDank> ah, finally got it.. --- hell it looked so easy in the 'demo.html' --- just use class='basic' to call it.... Didnt know you had to use 'actual scripting' to use it.. thanks for the help anyways.
[10:09:20] <sunbeam> how can i append a new <div id="something></div> at the begin of body{} ?
[10:09:42] <sunbeam> or better yet, at the end of body{}
[10:09:50] <sunbeam> i need it to be an absolute positioned overlay
[10:09:53] <shoky> sunbeam: prepend, append..
[10:10:34] <nerk> is there any plans on building out a x-domain json method for jquery.mobile as $.getJSON() fails for blackberry?
[10:10:47] <nerk> not that I need it anymore, I have built my own via xhr.
[10:11:21] <sunbeam> shoky: $("body").append("<div id='overlay'></div>");
[10:11:24] <sunbeam> simple as this?
[10:11:32] <shoky> ?tias
[10:11:32] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:12:54] <nerk> secondly, Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true don't work together.. so I have built my own getJSON method to append a &site parameter to the call with a value of window.location.origin.  Is there any issue with this?
[10:13:26] <sha1sum> Hey all. I have a long (800 records) list of things that I have a sort of live search/update for, and I've made some script that turns the search results' rows into accordion entries. The problem is that, with the code I have, the entries are turned into accordions on the first search, but after the first search, the results are filtered but the results are not turned into an accordion. See the code here: http://pastie.org/5479993
[10:14:17] <sha1sum> I'm assuming that this is sort of something like why the live() method is used, but since this isn't an event I'm not sure how to do this
[10:14:19] <nerk> eg.  I set a header on my json calls of Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <?php echo $_GET['site']; ?>
[10:14:56] <eydaimon> ejo: got it sorted with abunch of refactoring. thanks for your help
[10:15:15] <Caelum> I am getting intermittent "object does not this property or method" errors from jquery in IE8, the code in question is nothing particularly strange: var top_level = $('.main-nav > li[class=active] > a').text().trim();
[10:15:42] <sha1sum> If I knew what he hell to google for I could probably have the answer, but I'm not even sure what search terms to use for my problem
[10:20:11] <shoky> Caelum: IE8 doesn't support .trim()
[10:21:04] <shoky> ?g mdn trim @ Caelum
[10:21:06] <bot-t> Caelum, Trim - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim
[10:22:04] <sha1sum> OK, so I'm thinking that this has something to do with the fact that if I search once, it turns the accordion's div into an according using the visible items as the accordion header, but it doesn't work after that because the div is already an accordion. How would I "remove" the accordion from the div and create another one? Or is that even possible?
[10:22:50] <sha1sum> nevermind, just found accordion('destroy')
[10:23:00] <William|i7> also has refresh
[10:25:12] <gavri> I'd like for all the 302 responses that I get as a result of AJAX calls to cause a window.location.href navigation so that the full page is redirected to the url specified in the Location header
[10:25:19] <gavri> is that possible with jQuery?
[10:25:46] <gavri> I don't want to have to handle this in the response handler of each AJAX handler individually
[10:27:42] <William|i7> gavri i think you would need to detect that in the ajax success
[10:27:56] <William|i7> could write your own ajax handler to do it globally
[10:27:58] <gavri> William|i7: I was hoping there would be a cross cutting way to deal with this
[10:28:20] <gavri> it's possible to add a global ajax handler?
[10:28:28] <gavri> does it run before the individual handlers?
[10:28:38] <shoky> don't think you can detect 302 with ajax
[10:28:58] <shoky> it's handled transparently by the browser
[10:29:09] <William|i7> the web-server doesnt throw a 302 page?
[10:30:17] <William|i7> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call
[10:30:19] <William|i7> seems similar
[10:30:19] <gavri> I guess I can not use 302
[10:30:27] <gavri> and instead use a custom response header
[10:30:31] <William|i7> other method is using custom e..
[10:30:38] <William|i7> custom error pages
[10:30:44] <shoky> that SO solution doesn't use 302
[10:31:36] <gavri> I don't mind this solution
[10:31:42] <gavri> it's just that I'd like to handle it globally
[10:31:45] <shoky> go for it ;p
[10:31:52] <shoky> you can, i think
[10:32:32] <gavri> hmm, I have another problem here
[10:32:34] <shoky> ?ajaxSuccess
[10:32:34] <bot-t> .ajaxSuccess(handler): Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[10:33:00] <gavri> shoky: thanks. that's exactly what I want
[10:33:05] <gavri> but there's one more problem here
[10:33:33] <gavri> how would this work if it's not an AJAX call that meets a session timeout
[10:33:40] <gavri> what if it's a non-AJAX call?
[10:33:51] <gavri> in that case, I'd like the 302
[10:33:59] <shoky> hm? not sure what you're asking
[10:34:23] <gavri> I mean I'd like to redirect to a new page if the session times out either during an AJAX call or a non-AJAX call
[10:34:41] <gavri> with common code for both of these cases as much as possible
[10:35:14] * William|i7 thinks the answer on the stack link is likely the solution for both
[10:35:19] <nerk> there is a failure and timeout global as well as far as I know
[10:35:20] <William|i7> looking for a common element on success
[10:35:39] <William|i7> dont show the element if the session has expired, and ofc errors wont show it either
[10:36:11] <gavri> William|i7: the SO solution seems it'll only work for AJAX calls
[10:36:20] <gavri> the non-AJAX calls require a 302, right?
[10:37:03] <William|i7> i think the non ajax calls should be handled by your backend scripting language
[10:37:09] <William|i7> but maybe im confused to that term
[10:37:16] <William|i7> non-ajax means you browsed to the page
[10:37:19] <gavri> yeah
[10:37:25] <William|i7> your php would detect if session expired
[10:37:27] <William|i7> and redirect
[10:37:29] <William|i7> or asp, or w/e
[10:37:36] <gavri> yeah, so with a 302
[10:37:46] <gavri> so the backend code can't have a common session handling filter
[10:37:57] <gavri> it needs to be different for AJAX and non-AJAX calls
[10:37:58] <gavri> right?
[10:38:08] <William|i7> thats how i do it
[10:38:09] <gavri> AJAX calls: custom header or data
[10:38:17] <gavri> non-AJAX calls: 302
[10:38:42] <psilo3> How do I toggle the display property between 'whatever' and 'none' ?
[10:39:08] <psilo3> I can .hide() but then I've lost the initial value, and can't restore it unless I save it first.
[10:40:16] * William|i7 not sure how .hide would erase anything
[10:40:21] <William|i7> afaik hide just sets a display to none
[10:40:22] <gavri> William|i7, shoky, thanks a lot. I'll go with this solution
[10:40:28] <William|i7> gl gavri
[10:40:37] <gavri> thanks
[10:41:27] <Zzaichik> .css('display', 'whatever') or attr('style', 'display: whatever')
[10:41:52] * William|i7 votes .css method
[10:42:29] * shoky votes .toggleClass('whatever')
[10:42:35] <William|i7> ya
[10:42:36] <William|i7> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3337621/jquery-toggle-css
[10:43:13] <psilo3> Yeah I am using toggleClass with a .nodisplay class for now.
[10:43:19] <Zzaichik> I like that better - addClass() / removeClass()  and then handle the display property in the classnames.
[10:43:24] <shoky> psilo3: that's the best way
[10:43:33] <psilo3> Zzaichik: .hide removes the display properly entirely is the issue, so I can't restore it with .show
[10:44:06] <psilo3> .show just sets it to 'block' -- unless things have changed. I should get up to speed on the newer versiosn
[10:44:32] <shoky> well
[10:44:44] <Zzaichik> psilo3: I'd use .toggleClass()  and then handle the display property in your CSS
[10:44:55] <Zzaichik> â€¦attached to said classname
[10:45:48] <psilo3> so I will stick with what I got :)  Just seemed kinda hacky to have a .nodisplay { display: none; } class
[10:46:26] <Zzaichik> psilo3: that way is actually the less hacky. You're keeping styles, scripts, etc all contained to their own files.
[10:46:35] <shoky> psilo3: give it a class to begin with..   .whatever { display: whatever }   then .hide() and .show()   or .toggle()
[10:46:58] <shoky> psilo3: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5Pqkw/
[10:49:51] <psilo3> shoky: I know, I was not asking how to solve the problem, that's what I already do
[10:49:55] <psilo3> I was literally asking the question I asked
[10:50:18] <shoky> and i was answering it, no?
[10:50:50] <psilo3> shoky: oh true, I went off on the tangent afterwards, sorry
[10:51:06] <psilo3> I clarified that I already knew your solution :)  thanks for writing it out though
[10:51:22] <psilo3> I guess it is less hackish though, as Zzaichik said.  I will stick with it
[10:52:09] <tklun> psilo3: you could give .nodisplay a more sematic name if you wanted
[10:53:42] <tklun> that way, if you decide later that toggling that class should do something other than switch display you're not stuck renaming the class as well
[10:54:01] <Caelum> shoky: oh I see, thank you! But I thought .trim() was a jquery function?
[10:57:11] <Caelum> shoky: ah so .text() doesn't return a jquery object, I have to call $.trim: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3439316/ie8-and-jquerys-trim
[11:19:36] <jrockjiggz> is there a jquery function to determine if string is alphanumeric
[11:20:37] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(string)
[11:21:10] <BillCriswell> Anyone know of a service to set up a quick contact form?
[11:23:26] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: /^[a-z0-9]+$/i.test(string) might be a little easier to understand
[11:24:41] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: that will work, thank you
[11:24:47] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: Sweeeeet.
[11:25:39] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: i was using http://dpaste.org/fCyee/ I wonder what hh>47 && hh<58 is all about
[11:27:15] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: a would be 97, b would be 98, c would be 99, etc.
[11:27:59] <BillCriswell> This one is probably a lot faster than mine, but less readable ( in my opinion ).
[11:28:05] <wachpwnski> this is pretty basic, but how do you make a function that you can chain of another function?
[11:28:30] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: It returns the unicode.
[11:29:27] <wachpwnski> like if you have a function that  this.foo = function() { â€¦ }  do I declare another function as this.foo.bar = function()
[11:29:52] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: I was using at if( alphane(str) ){ //do } as the function returned true or false.. not very readible, just was causing issues because if string was NULL it was crashing
[11:30:07] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: Ah, no good.
[11:31:35] <ColKurtz> wachpwnski, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Maintaining_Chainability
[11:36:08] <hateIE> does any one here know if facebook has a callback mechinisim that contacts your server when a user authenticates via the fb app
[11:37:58] <hateIE> I can connected the fb account and the account on my site with the fb user id.. then if facebook could report that user logged in to a script on your server then you could syncronize the authentification securely
[11:42:44] <zduffy> what selector should I use to select the correct class in a while loop that increases by 1 each new span
[11:42:51] <zduffy> for instance span1 span2 span3
[11:43:23] <mohadib> hello, I'm trying to grab some json using jsonp. This all seems to work fine, but the response is not parsed into json. Am I doing something wrong? http://pastebin.com/CrRVfTPP  thanks.
[11:44:01] <bricker> In jquery-ui, I have two separate "sortable" divs working fine, but I want to actually share elements between them. Is there a solution for this? Does it even make sense?
[11:44:38] <halcyon1234> zduffy: What's wrong with $(".span" + loop)?
[11:45:05] <zduffy> halcyon1234: Thats the problem I didn't know how to write the selector. I will try that thank you
[11:45:21] <BD--> is it really ugly / frowned upon to use both jquery and regular javascript ?
[11:45:30] <BD--> i mean, on the same page
[11:45:50] <ajpiano> no, it's encourage
[11:45:54] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs
[11:45:55] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[11:46:02] <ajpiano> jquery is a javascript library not a javascript replacement
[11:46:55] <BD--> so i shouldn't use a jquery equivalent just because it exists :p
[11:47:07] <BD--> for consistency's sake
[11:47:52] <ajpiano> it's really dependent on the situation
[11:48:05] <ajpiano> but in general yes it makes sense to use elem.id instead of $(elem).attr("id")
[11:48:10] <wachpwnski> ColKurtz: I was more talking about chaining off of my existing namespace?
[11:48:21] <DrDank> what are some of yalls' favorite or must used plugins?? ;)
[11:48:31] <ColKurtz> wachpwnski, well the concept is the same. you need to return your object.
[11:48:47] <BD--> for instance, when i copy/paste a piece of code from another website or tutorial which doesn't use jquery, i tend to rewrite it using jquery selectors, for instance
[11:49:01] <BD--> but i dunno if it's looked down upon if you don't
[11:49:03] <bricker> I should learn to RTFM... jQueryUI/Sortable already provides an option to connect two lists: connectWith
[11:49:24] <ColKurtz> jquery has it standardized so that you return the jquery collection. but you can return whatever you want to chain your next function onto
[11:50:03] <wachpwnski> Let me past some code so you know what I am doing.
[11:50:13] <NoiseEee> BD--: there's no point including jquery if you're not going to use it.
[11:50:21] <shoky> mohadib: it seems your server is passing the jsonp callback a JSON string instead of an object
[11:50:32] <NoiseEee> BD--: thats frowned upon much more
[11:51:49] <BD--> hmm, so you shouldn't just use it for ease of development, but only if you really need to get stuff done that's substantially more difficult without it ?
[11:51:51] <R00tk3y> mohadib echo json_encode($json_response);
[11:52:02] <shoky> no..
[11:52:08] <NoiseEee> BD--: you should be using it, period
[11:52:09] <R00tk3y> Yes...
[11:52:12] <shoky> well, not only
[11:52:13] <BD--> ^_^
[11:52:18] <R00tk3y> Well what then
[11:52:26] <shoky> needs the jsonp callback..
[11:52:34] <NoiseEee> BD--: nobody's giving you points for document.getElementById('dog') instead of $('#dog')
[11:52:34] <R00tk3y> Never used it
[11:52:43] <shoky> then why are you answering ;]
[11:52:53] <NoiseEee> BD--: in fact, both return completely different things as far as jquery goes, so if you're including/using jquery, use it :)
[11:52:54] <R00tk3y> Cause my method is easier
[11:52:56] <BD--> i dunno, potential customers or other people who might be evaluating my code might be :)
[11:53:09] <shoky> R00tk3y: huh :\
[11:53:14] <R00tk3y> BD-- sound like you are a perfectionist
[11:53:22] <BD--> haha, isn't any developer :p
[11:53:25] <vacho> <a href="search.php">Search</a>
[11:53:35] <R00tk3y> Shoky
[11:53:41] <R00tk3y> Okay so what function would you use
[11:53:46] <NoiseEee> BD--: honestly whats worse is including a library and not taking advantage of it.
[11:53:47] <R00tk3y> to send back the json?
[11:53:50] <vacho> <a href="search.php">Search</a> ........ a:contains('search').remove();
[11:53:52] <vacho> what am I doing wrong?
[11:53:56] <BD--> yea i understand
[11:53:58] <shoky> R00tk3y: its not a JSON request, it's a JSONP request
[11:54:23] <R00tk3y> vach $('a [href="search.php"]). BLAH BLAH
[11:54:28] <BD--> btw, is the underscore.js library widely accepted and tested performance-wise ?
[11:54:34] <wachpwnski> ColKurtz:  https://gist.github.com/0801c9b8575526d77ad5  like this...
[11:54:50] <BD--> it seems to have handy tools that jquery doesn't offer
[11:54:54] <R00tk3y> BD, when I first started my website project, I was a perfectionist too
[11:54:58] <BD--> for working with collections and stuff
[11:55:07] <DrDank> any users of SimpleModal lurking around here? :-D
[11:55:14] <R00tk3y> But I think what you really want is to finish the project that you're working on, and never have to work on it again
[11:55:16] <mohadib> R00tk3y: thanks, i just need to remove the quotes i had around the reponse, on the server side
[11:55:22] <R00tk3y> If anything is further from the truth, that is
[11:55:33] <R00tk3y> No problem mohadib
[11:55:49] <BD--> huh ?
[11:55:50] <ColKurtz> Sorry wachpwnski I'm afraid I don't have time to dive in and figure this out with you, good luck
[11:56:05] <BD--> you're kidding ?
[11:56:06] <R00tk3y> BD-- I am trying to say, don't be a perfectionist, just do what you gotta do
[11:56:16] <BD--> i don't agree :')
[11:56:24] <R00tk3y> Then you will never finish on time
[11:56:32] <BD--> i believe i will :)
[11:56:33] <shoky> BD--: underscore is widely accepted ya
[11:56:36] <BD--> ok tnx
[11:56:55] <vacho> beautiful thanks
[11:56:57] <R00tk3y> Yeah, BD--, is it about getting it right?
[11:56:59] <vacho> can I make this more beautiful: $('a[href="'+window.location.pathname.substring(window.location.pathname.lastIndexOf('/')+1)+'"]').parent().addClass('active');
[11:57:08] <R00tk3y> Because you won't get it right the first time, the second time, the third time, etc etc
[11:57:12] <R00tk3y> Nothing will ever be perfect
[11:57:21] <BD--> disagree :)
[11:57:27] <BD--> well, maybe in js that's true ;)
[11:57:38] <BD--> i'm a professional c# developer though
[11:57:43] <BD--> just learning js now in my spare time
[11:57:46] <R00tk3y> Yeah, BD--
[11:57:57] <BD--> and in c#, there are definitely practices which are better than others :p
[11:58:02] <R00tk3y> Im talking about projects
[11:58:03] <BD--> all depending on the situation, of course
[11:58:08] <R00tk3y> Anyone can learn a programming language lol.
[11:58:25] <R00tk3y> I know ASM/C++/SQL/PHP/VB
[11:58:34] <BD--> and the situation might include an impossible deadline, in which perfectionism isn't the best solution, of course :p
[11:58:43] <misteroneill> BD--: the same is true of javascript - there are best practices and there are bad practices. perfection, by definition, is impossible because we're all humans, but we sure do try :)
[11:58:48] <shoky> R00tk3y: you sure are babbling
[11:58:49] <BD--> in which case* - damn i'm drunk :p
[11:58:58] <R00tk3y> All im saying is don't waste your time thinking about the problem, just complete the problem
[11:59:03] <R00tk3y> Shoky, you are still mad from earlier
[11:59:11] <BD--> ^^
[11:59:17] <shoky> you're showing the same behaviour
[11:59:22] <shoky> so, sure :P
[11:59:23] <R00tk3y> Shoky you also never gave me that function
[11:59:35] <BD--> sure, and by researching solutions to the problem, you get wiser, and will be more likely to use the 'good practice' to solve it than using a 'bad practice' ;Ã 
[11:59:42] <misteroneill> i disagree. programming is mostly thinking. typing code into an editor is a small part of it
[11:59:50] <BD--> and in time, using only good practices will come as natural and easy :)
[11:59:50] <shoky> R00tk3y it's not some function.. also i dont know php ;p
[11:59:51] <R00tk3y> True BD--
[11:59:55] <misteroneill> (disagreeing with "don't waste your time thinking")
[12:00:09] <R00tk3y> Im not saying DONT think on how to do the problem
[12:00:14] <R00tk3y> Im saying don't think about it being perfect
[12:00:28] <R00tk3y> And then scraping code because it doesn't feel like you've done it to the best standards
[12:00:28] <BD--> well it's an iterative process, for sure :)
[12:00:31] <BD--> which never ends, probably :p
[12:00:35] <R00tk3y> Exactly, thats all im saying
[12:00:41] <BD--> k then we agree ;)
[12:00:43] <R00tk3y> Im not trying to insult you
[12:00:45] <zduffy> Would this be the correct syntax for including a php variable? $('#Hide' + <?php echo $num; ?> ).removeClass('hide');
[12:00:50] <BD--> none taken :)
[12:00:59] <R00tk3y> No Zduffy
[12:01:11] <R00tk3y> What does $num contain?
[12:01:20] <BD--> that said, i still got like a few thousands of coding js to go before i'll consider myself to be proficient :p
[12:01:29] <BD--> thousands of hours *
[12:01:43] <zduffy> $num = 1;
[12:01:48] <R00tk3y> I google things
[12:01:58] <R00tk3y> I know the concepts
[12:02:22] <R00tk3y> So if you didn't have the php zduffy
[12:02:23] <R00tk3y> would it be
[12:02:26] <shankey> hey can any one help me on how to read local file in come
[12:02:38] <R00tk3y> $('#Hide 1'), $('#hide 2') ??
[12:02:44] <zduffy> COrrect
[12:02:55] <zduffy> well no. php makes it increment by 1
[12:02:57] <shankey> How to read local file in chrome?
[12:03:01] <R00tk3y> I know
[12:03:05] <zduffy> thats how the selectors would read lol
[12:03:32] <ronson> Why is this input not focusing? http://jsfiddle.net/Q6Set/
[12:04:03] <shoky> uh
[12:04:04] <R00tk3y> $outputJS = "$('#hide".$num."' ).removeClass('hide')";
[12:04:04] <shankey> zduffy: hey hi do u know how to read local file in chrome?
[12:04:19] <systemfault> ronson: How about actually using a <label>?
[12:04:29] <R00tk3y> then you can just echo out the outputJS
[12:04:31] <zduffy> what do you mean shankey?
[12:04:40] <R00tk3y> Shankey, what are you talking about lol
[12:04:41] <ajpiano> shankey: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[12:04:48] <shoky> ronson: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Q6Set/1/
[12:05:07] <zduffy> R00tk3y: why would I set a php variable like that?
[12:05:18] <R00tk3y> You dont hav eto
[12:05:48] <relipse>  what is the best way to do the Text label inside the input feature (like http://basecamp.com/)
[12:05:49] <shankey> zduffy: i am trying to read a txt file in my local machine using ajax it works fine in firefox but in crome its showing error
[12:06:30] <R00tk3y> Relipse, however that is not a jQuery question
[12:06:38] <R00tk3y> Relipse, you should use a background image
[12:06:43] <Eviltwin> ...
[12:07:07] <Eviltwin> relipse: Try inspecting their elements
[12:07:19] <Eviltwin> You'll see they have a <label><span/><input></label> configuration
[12:07:28] <R00tk3y> After inspecting they have a span, I guess you could do it that
[12:07:28] <Eviltwin> With some CSS that styles spans and inputs inside of labels
[12:07:29] <shankey> ajpiano: thanks actually i am trying to read a txt file in my local machine using ajax it works fine in firefox but in crome its showing error
[12:07:35] <ajpiano> cool
[12:07:53] <ajpiano> are you trying to do read a local file using $.ajax... are you on file:/// or are you running a local web server?
[12:07:56] <R00tk3y> Shankey, you are using .ajax
[12:07:56] <R00tk3y> ?
[12:08:09] <R00tk3y> Yeah Shankey, are you on file:// or localhost?
[12:08:21] <shankey> ajpiano: m on file://
[12:08:29] <R00tk3y> Thats why
[12:08:29] <ajpiano> you can't do ajax over file:/// reliably
[12:08:31] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/ how do i get the number buttons to add their respective digit to the selected text input?
[12:08:58] <ronson> shoky i cant use ids
[12:09:01] <shankey> R00tk3y: i am on file://
[12:09:04] <ronson> which is why im doing it programmatically
[12:09:15] <R00tk3y> Shankey, you have to be on a webserver
[12:09:29] <R00tk3y> Is your files in xampp or wampp?
[12:10:08] <shankey> R00tk3y: actually requirement is file is in the same folder where my main html is
[12:10:30] <shankey> its a kind of mini assignment
[12:10:37] <shankey> on web server
[12:10:45] <shankey> sorry no web server
[12:10:48] <shoky> ronson: use click instead of mousedown
[12:11:19] <R00tk3y> Shankey, you can't some browser it won't work
[12:11:25] <misteroneill> ronson: why can't you use ids? also, you could just put the input inside the label.
[12:11:45] <shankey> ajpiano: but ajax is working fine to read local file in firefox problem is with chrome
[12:11:52] <ronson> shoky: strange but works, thx
[12:11:56] <R00tk3y> Different browser, different problems
[12:11:57] * hlve[workaholic] slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[12:12:06] <Eviltwin> shankey: The browsers are inconsistent in how they handle it
[12:12:12] <shoky> ronson: not strange, click event happens after mousedown, which then cuases input to lose focus again
[12:12:13] <ronson> misteroneill: I can't guarantee there wont be duplicate ids
[12:12:21] <shoky> oi hlve[workaholic]
[12:12:24] <ronson> shoky: oh makes sense
[12:12:26] <Eviltwin> shankey: If I remember correctly, Firefox lets you request anything in file:///
[12:12:38] <Eviltwin> Safari only lets you request stuff in the current directory or subdirectories
[12:12:44] <shankey> Eviltwin: yes in firefox it works fine
[12:12:44] <Eviltwin> And Chrome only lets you request the current file
[12:12:57] <misteroneill> ronson: you could if you generated them programmatically, but regardless you can put the input inside the label
[12:13:01] <Eviltwin> By changing certain config, you can make them be more lax
[12:13:17] <Eviltwin> But you have no way of doing that from within the browser
[12:13:24] <shankey> Eviltwin:  the file that i am trying to read is in the current directory only
[12:13:35] <Eviltwin> shankey: Please read above
[12:13:42] <Eviltwin> And Chrome only lets you request the current file
[12:14:44] <ajpiano> shankey: the specifics of your particular situation and assignment are irrelevant.  ajax to local files is a fundamentally broken thing and you should look into running a simple local webserver. the behaviour in chrome is by design: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40787&q=ajax%20local&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Feature%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS
[12:15:05] <ronson> misteroneill: i could have sworn that putting the input inside the label didnt work for me in the past
[12:22:12] <Heather_> can I collect val like this? $("select[name=category"+id+"]").val();
[12:22:47] <NoiseEee> Heather_: what happened when you tried?
[12:24:20] <Heather_> and suddenly its working thanks anyway.
[12:26:29] <halcyon1234> Heather_ Make sure id is not null, or the selector will fail (I assume)
[12:40:17] <BillCriswell> Heather_: Just blame the caching.
[12:40:35] <BillCriswell> "Must have been cached or something" is my favorite reason.
[12:52:17] <katsh> this.style.background;  how do i use that with a background-image instead of width?

[13:00:36] <warbler> err
[13:00:44] <warbler> http://willjessup.com/sandbox/jquery/rotator/rotator.html
[13:00:57] <warbler> would that have harmful side effects if I changed the text to images?
[13:01:03] <Zzaichik> I'd totally poop my pants
[13:01:07] <warbler> haha
[13:01:16] <warbler> i have like, a 12 year old audience
[13:01:17] <warbler> cmon now
[13:01:23] <Zzaichik> hahahh
[13:01:24] <warbler> dont be so sarcastic hahaha
[13:01:39] <warbler> seriously though, can it be done?
[13:01:40] <Zzaichik> literally poop my pants
[13:01:41] <warbler> im a jquery nooblet
[13:01:46] <warbler> 3 days into it
[13:01:52] <warbler> and eating it like bacon
[13:02:00] <Zzaichik> (I didn't even look at your post yet) hah
[13:02:04] <warbler> nice
[13:02:09] <Zzaichik> I know.
[13:02:19] <warbler> well im gonna grab something to drink while you mull it around a little
[13:06:25] <Zzaichik> I don't see why not - it would be cool, quite a bit different than that side scroll/carousel. It looks like that script is changing font size, so you'd have to switch it from font-size to width. How easy that would be, I'm not sure.
[13:10:51] <microhxo> Is this possible?  $("#somediv").load('http://www.google.com').dialog({modal:true});
[13:11:00] <microhxo> google is not loading in the modal..
[13:12:36] <Caelum> try: $('#somediv').load('http://www.google.com/', function() { $('#somediv').dialog({modal:true}); });
[13:13:59] <microhxo> thanks, ill try that.
[13:14:01] <davoclavo> correct me if im wrong, but you can't load cross domain urls
[13:14:18] <microhxo> i just want to load a new page into a modal, not possible?
[13:14:27] <davoclavo> if it is in your domain, it is possible
[13:14:36] <Caelum> oh right
[13:14:42] <davoclavo> try this: $("#somediv").load('/');
[13:14:49] <davoclavo> and it'll load your root url into that div
[13:15:16] <davoclavo> if you want to load an external url, you can use an iframe
[13:15:39] <davoclavo> but you won't be able to access its contents with jquery
[13:17:35] <ColKurtz> KIND OF FALSE: I have implemented something with Ben Alman's postMessage plugin that allowed me to communicate between an external iframe and its parent document
[13:19:55] <Caelum> why do these stupid restrictions exist anyway
[13:19:57] <DrDank> anyone suggest a good scripting tutorial? ;)
[13:20:29] <Caelum> DrDank: I really like the book "jquery in action"
[13:20:54] <DrDank> Caelum, times are hard man.. cant really afford 20-35 bucks for a book.. i can barely afford internet. lol
[13:23:22] <ColKurtz> Caelum, security reasons
[13:24:02] <Caelum> ColKurtz: like what kind of security reasons? it seems just arbitrary limitations
[13:24:37] <Caelum> ColKurtz: I can do .load("/get.cgi?url=www.google.com") so what's the difference?
[13:26:46] <ColKurtz> well going into it enough to properly understand it would be a big exercise that would require me to do a good chunk of reading, so I'll leave that to you :P but the jist of it is to limit XSS (Cross-site scripting) vulnerabilities and other client-side vulnerabilities like a CSRF attack
[13:26:51] <warbler> Zzaichik I think I just pooped a lil, I shall name it awesome: http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/carousel.htm
[13:28:22] <Zzaichik> much better
[13:28:30] <davoclavo> for example, you could fill out forms programmatically, without having CSRF issues
[13:30:31] <sunbeam> i'd like to hide a div when ANYwhere outside the div is clicked
[13:30:35] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[13:30:54] <Caelum> davoclavo: well the solution to XSS/CSRF etc. it seems to me would just to do the ajax requests in a sandbox (without cookies etc.) no? not disable it alltogether?
[13:36:16] <Caelum> sunbeam: maybe something like: $('body').click(function() { $('#div').hide(); return true; }); $('#div').click(function() { return false; });
[13:37:35] <sunbeam> Caelum: thx
[14:30:49] <warbler> carousel success! 4 days into jquery im loving it...now to make it the BEST it can look... check it out though http://pointstackers.com/
[14:31:01] <warbler> i know I gotta change all the images but ive been meaning to do that anyway
[14:31:24] <warbler> for some reason my shoutbox is failing due to that carousel installation though....
[14:31:33] <warbler> and im a rookie jquery debugger
[14:31:34] <warbler> meh
[14:32:26] <`d3m0n> Error: TypeError: $("a#example1").fancybox is not a function Line: 66
[14:33:29] <`d3m0n> interesting carousel too, Im used to pointing my cursor in the direction I want the carousel to turn
[14:34:13] <`d3m0n> And are you trying to rip of the style of Game Center on iPhone :P
[14:36:15] <warbler> oO
[14:36:22] <warbler> wait what am I ripping off?
[14:36:40] <warbler> is that a challenge </best mufasa voice>
[14:37:11] <warbler> seriously though... i need to make it better (image size changing.....long and TEDIOUS work...bleghsdlhglhalhb)
[14:37:26] <ColKurtz> warbler, what could "canybox is not a function" mean
[14:39:32] <warbler> adding that carousel broke my shoutbox for some reason and i have NO IDEA why
[14:39:36] <warbler> it's destroying my soul
[14:39:46] <warbler> is there no messiah who will come and save me

[14:40:31] <prasanth_g> i'm having trouble in calling the tipsy function
[14:41:38] <katsh> when the user has a select file dialog open, how do i detect which button was clicked? (open, cancel)
[14:41:47] <shoky> prasanth_g: ok, first turn the computer on
[14:42:03] <shoky> unless it's already on. is it on
[14:42:09] <prasanth_g> lol shoky
[14:44:13] <prasanth_g> i found out that js files aren't correctly included. will be back with update
[14:48:54] <prasanth_g> ok. the supporting files are correctly included. now how to call the tipsy function to replace all the title tags on the site?
[14:50:11] <Caelum> katsh: you can't script file inputs, IE does not allow it
[14:57:12] <hugo_moss> hi, im trying to do a series of animations with promises, when i do a chain of promises var promise1= fadein promise2= fadeout promise3= whatever, i do all of this in a function, and i do return promise1.then(promise2).then(promise3).promise();
[14:57:29] <hugo_moss> each animation doesnt wait for the other animation to fully complete
[14:57:31] <hugo_moss> why is that?
[14:58:53] <shoky> prasanth_g: there are examples on that link..
[14:59:34] <prasanth_g> yes, but i cant figure out how to use
[15:00:07] <prasanth_g> i'm having many ids and how can i include all of them?
[15:00:42] <shoky> you can select all of them (seperated by comma in a selector) but.. use a class
[15:01:32] <shoky> $('.myclass').tipsy()
[15:02:22] <hugo_moss> hey shoky
[15:02:33] <shoky> hi hugo_moss
[15:04:07] <hugo_moss> can you tell me why a series of then(promise) and returning the completed chains promise (of animations), doesnt allow time for each animation to fully complete?
[15:04:33] <prasanth_g> can i make it overwrite the title tags automatically? without defining classes?
[15:05:07] <prasanth_g> as we usually have title tags in <a href, is it possible to make it work for all <a href title tags?
[15:07:08] <hugo_moss> let me try pipe
[15:07:27] <shoky> hugo_moss: in 1.8  .then and .pipe are the same
[15:07:58] <shoky> hugo_moss:  make a jsfiddle
[15:12:31] <prasanth_g> http://shortefilms.com
[15:12:43] <prasanth_g> shoky can you suggest which classes can i include?
[15:12:48] <gavri> I'd like to use this http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[15:12:57] <gavri> but it looks like it has to be called on a specific object
[15:13:02] <gavri> which one do I call it on?
[15:13:14] <gavri> I want to do "window.location.href=newurl"
[15:13:29] <hugo_moss> fuck it works :)
[15:13:51] <hugo_moss> i wonder why the other way with then didnt work
[15:15:47] <hugo_moss> shoky, i had it like this function() { var promise1= $(something).fadeIn(); var promise2 $(something_else).fadeIn(); var promise3= $(last_something).fadeIn(); return promise1.then(promise2).then(promise3).promise();
[15:16:12] <hugo_moss> it wouldnt wait for all the animations to complete
[15:16:35] <shoky> prasanth_g: $('.title > a').tipsy()
[15:16:57] <shoky> prasanth_g: donno where you want the tooltips.. thats on the movie titles
[15:17:16] <prasanth_g> everywhere where the title tags are displayed
[15:17:18] <prasanth_g> :)
[15:17:39] <prasanth_g> title tags are displayed for movie titles, username, contact us links and all
[15:17:42] <shoky> hugo_moss: uhh but .fadeIn() doesnt return a promise
[15:17:49] <hugo_moss> now i did return $(something).fadeIn().promise().pipe( function(){ return somethingelse.fadeIn(); }).pipe( function(){ return something.fadeIn();});
[15:17:55] <hugo_moss> and it worked
[15:17:59] <hugo_moss> anybody know why?
[15:18:04] <shoky> now you used the .promise()  ..
[15:18:17] <hugo_moss> oops sorry in the original i used .promise
[15:18:27] <shoky> see this is why i said, fiddle ;]
[15:18:31] <hugo_moss> lol
[15:18:32] <hugo_moss> yes
[15:19:27] <shoky> prasanth_g: what's a title tag?
[15:19:53] <shoky> there's a title tag only in <head> ;p
[15:19:56] <prasanth_g> i mean title element in <a href :P
[15:20:05] <prasanth_g> sorry :)
[15:20:07] <shoky> attribute
[15:20:26] <shoky> $('[title]') could work for that..
[15:20:36] <synapt> Is it possible to use the .load() method to detect when an object of some form is 'loaded'?
[15:21:02] <synapt> I'm running into horrible race condition issues with the facebook API where it's not fully loaded before $(document).ready() is
[15:26:16] <abjorn> :o
[15:27:45] <prasanth_g> damn, don't know what the problem is. it isnt showing though i had used $('[title]')
[15:30:41] <vending> hello guys, anyone had tried to put googlecharts inside tabs? it seems something else puts the chart without its styled width.
[15:34:32] <shoky> prasanth_g: works for me.. $('[title]').tipsy()
[15:34:49] <prasanth_g> O_o
[15:34:58] <prasanth_g> how come i don't see
[15:40:10] <shoky> maybe you are running it before the elements exist?

[15:58:25] <shoky> call the tipsy function in the ajax callback
[15:58:29] <codygman> What jquery can I use to notify a jqxhr object that the request failed?
[15:58:51] <shoky> to notify the object..?
[15:59:01] <codygman> you know .error, how do I trigger it?
[15:59:03] <shoky> isn't it the one that notifies you
[15:59:26] <codygman> I'm doing a post and wondering how to communicate that there was an error. Does it rely on there being a 403 or something?
[15:59:50] <shoky> not only 403..
[16:00:19] <codygman> How would I make my login return json to trigger .error?
[16:00:29] <codygman> it currently returns a json with error details
[16:00:40] <shoky> you dont, there was no error with the request
[16:00:48] <shoky> you can make your own $.Deferred() if you want
[16:00:52] <codygman> okay, so xhr deals with things like server errors
[16:01:00] <codygman> sorry, bad wording

[16:40:42] <cyounkins> coldhead: Right. Is jQuery UI supposed to mess with it in this way? It seems to be causing problems with plugins not being recognized.

[17:40:01] <andromedian> how can i replace a character inside many h1  by using query?
[17:42:25] <Caelum> andromedian: $('h1.class').each(function() { $(this).html($(this).html().replace("foo", "bar")); });
[17:53:13] <andromedian> Caelum, it doesn't seem to work am i doing something wrong?
[17:53:48] <andromedian> sorry i am newbie when it comes to jquery
[18:00:14] <andromedian> Caelum, http://jsfiddle.net/W4FyV/2/
[18:01:32] <tester9000> Looking for advice. I have 10 inputs and each has a validator stored in an an array, so when input 1is clicked, I get the id and call the function at validators[ id ]. Is there a better way to associate them without using attributes?
[18:02:56] <shoky> ?data @ tester9000
[18:02:56] <bot-t> tester9000, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[18:04:19] <shoky> andromedian: the <h1> doesn't have a class called 'class'
[18:05:49] <tester9000> shoky: OK, I just thought of that too.. thanks. I read this is bad practice to store data in the DOM. is that true?
[18:05:52] <shoky> andromedian: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/W4FyV/4/
[18:06:19] <andromedian> thanks shoky and Caelum
[18:07:05] <shoky> tester9000: to store it in the DOM itself is bad practice yes, but here with .data only a reference to the data is stored in the DOM
[18:07:08] <wroathe> tester9000: It can be bad. The way jQuery handles it internally is by creating a property on the element with an ID for the internal cache of jQuery
[18:07:30] <tester9000> ok good, thanks guys
[18:08:22] <DrDank> Which 'form' design/enhancement plugin do you guys prefer? -- Im about to start mine and dont wanna have to redo it two or three times..
[18:08:35] <tester9000> initally I was going to add an event to all 10 inputs but using delegation and storing data with jquery should be good
[18:08:53] <shoky> sounds good yup

[18:39:26] <shankey> hey  trying to read external html using ajax it giving an error
[18:41:54] <defaultro> hi folks, need some help referencing to the value. I would like to start from the input. Here is the html, http://pastebin.com/52b1JALR
[18:43:52] <defaultro> $("input[name="text"] .inputValue").val(), like this?
[18:59:48] <shoky> defaultro: what exactly do you want to get?
[19:00:06] <shoky> Restaurant?
[19:00:12] <defaultro> yes
[19:00:24] <defaultro> grab the Restaurant value
[19:00:54] <shoky> for that.. $('input[name=type]').next().text()
[19:01:00] <shoky> .val() is for getting the value of inputs
[19:01:09] <defaultro> k
[19:01:19] <defaultro> what does next() do?
[19:01:26] <shoky> goes to the next sibling element
[19:01:31] <defaultro> awesome! :D
[19:01:33] <shoky> (inputs dont have children)
[19:01:43] <defaultro> learned new things today. Thanks shoky :)

[19:28:45] <feathersanddown> where can I find information about a "jquery object"?
[19:28:48] <feathersanddown> what is ?
[19:29:34] <astropirate> feathersanddown, the source code
[19:29:41] <astropirate> its hosted on github
[19:33:58] <shoky> feathersanddown: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jQuery  and  http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[19:40:12] <Idealien> Can anybody suggest why in http://pastebin.com/dAwLALPU row 24 (doing a .find on a pre-existing data of <li> elements) would not work or log anything to console?
[19:40:46] <Idealien> The .find logic it's using works a few rows above with a different data-set.

[19:43:16] <shankey> how can i load external html content using ajax in chrome
[19:44:03] <JZA> shankey: same way you load an XML
[19:44:10] <JZA> or a textfile
[19:45:57] <otherj> can anyone help me understand how to make this demo: http://alittlecode.com/files/jQuery-Validate-Demo/ not show the success: bit for fields that aren't required?
[19:47:10] <otherj> when i dumplicate it and add other fields they end up having the success class added to them as well even though they're not required
[19:51:01] <shankey> JZA: it works fine with xml but m trying to load content of another html file
[19:52:08] <shankey> JZA: it works fine in case of firefox but in crome it gives me an error XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///home/shankey/Downloads/st1/html5canvas.html. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[19:52:09] <Idealien> Issue was .find vs .filter syntax use.

[20:10:44] <mdedetrich> does anyone know if you can do blocking events in jquery
[20:11:20] <mdedetrich> that is, when an event fires (on lets say a button click), another event will not fire on that button until the original callback has finished?
[20:12:59] <shoky> mdedetrich: javascript is single-threaded, no other events will fire while your current callback is running
[20:13:17] <mdedetrich> uh, that has nothing to do with what im saying
[20:13:32] <mdedetrich> javascript is non blocking
[20:13:38] <shoky> "another event will not fire on that button until the original callback has finished"
[20:13:43] <shoky> that is given..
[20:13:58] <mdedetrich> shoky: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10722988
[20:14:00] <mdedetrich> that is what I mean
[20:14:23] <mdedetrich> however a solution that is nicer (i.e. doesn't involve having to add classes all the time)
[20:15:34] <mdedetrich> if you have multiple callbacks registered on a single event, they will all occur asynchronously
[20:16:17] <shoky> one will not be fired until another has completed
[20:20:25] <mdedetrich> that doesn't make sense, if a cb that is registered on a event is asynchronous
[20:20:37] <mdedetrich> it has no way of knowing when the first one is completed
[20:21:41] <shoky> the cb doesnt need to know..
[20:21:45] <shoky> the javascript engine knows
[20:21:52] <shoky> because its the one handling the _single_ event loop
[20:23:16] <shoky> and that SO link doesnt really help me understand what you mean
[20:23:26] <shoky> and what your real problem is
[20:25:41] <shoky> also what makes you say that "javascript is non blocking"
[20:34:01] <shoky> er. of course , i didnt take into account what happens when you trigger an event from within your callback
[20:34:29] <shoky> which was silly of me
[20:34:38] <shoky> gnight
[20:41:36] <Guest82845> hello guys anyone
[20:42:28] <w00tner> i have a div that works as a sidebar and inside of it i have this tabs from jquery ui ... but when the tabs are inside the cointainer it changes the syles
[20:42:33] <w00tner> outside the divs works fine
[20:42:44] <davemo> mdedetrich: see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[20:43:21] <davemo> mdedetrich: which interplays nicely with http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[20:44:03] <w00tner> how i tell jquery to ignore the parent div style ?
[20:44:18] <mdedetrich> davemo: cheers
[20:46:52] <coldhead> that's a CSS problem, not a jQuery problem w00tner
[20:46:59] <coldhead> you might have to add !important
[20:48:10] <w00tner> in wich element ?
[20:49:06] <coldhead> the one where the styles are wrong
[20:49:11] <coldhead> so probably the jquery-ui.css
[20:49:36] <coldhead> or you can make the parent CSS more specific so it doesn't mess with the children
[20:51:13] <w00tner> how ??
[20:51:17] <w00tner> adding a class ?
[20:51:40] <coldhead> yes
[20:51:56] <coldhead> so if you have #sidebar div {background-colour: pink}
[20:52:05] <coldhead> and that's affecting the tabs
[20:52:20] <coldhead> then change it to #sidebar div.someclass {background-colour: pink}
[20:52:27] <coldhead> so it won't affect the tabs
[20:52:33] <w00tner> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpe5V/1/
[20:53:12] <w00tner> the div #columna2 is messsing with #tabs
[20:53:23] <w00tner> if i put the tabs outside the container it works fine
[20:59:21] <oojacoboo> does onMouseOver event fire if you're dragging a file?
[21:01:14] <oojacoboo> the answer appears to be no
[21:01:21] <w00tner> :P
[21:01:31] <oojacoboo> anyone know if there is an event for this?
[21:02:27] <w00tner> try to add  ondragover="return false"  to the div
[21:02:50] <oojacoboo> or use that event instead...
[21:10:33] <oojacoboo> ugh
[21:22:41] <d3nial> hi guys, im a n00b to all this, hoping someone might be able to suggest their favourite php framework, or perhaps another framework they like to code in :P
[21:23:08] <d3nial> *when I say n00b, i dont mean complete n00b, but recovering civil engineer ;)
[21:24:18] <w00tner> google like a mofo
[21:25:00] <d3nial> lol thanks :P went through google, everyone has their opinions :p thought you guys might have something more insightful then the blogosphere. all good tho, happy to keep digging and find something i like
[21:25:34] <matteu> d3nial: django
[21:26:08] <w00tner> im trying to get into python and django and a little bit of symfony too
[21:26:16] <w00tner> jquery ftw
[21:26:24] <w00tner> and mongodb
[21:26:57] <d3nial> w00tner, thanks, a good mate suggested I ween myself off of php and get into django
[21:27:03] <d3nial> w00tner, are you liking it
[21:27:04] <d3nial> ?
[21:27:24] <w00tner> im more into frontend right now workign with jquery ui too
[21:27:49] <d3nial> yeah me too, building enterprise apps - need something that can scale better
[21:29:03] <w00tner> mobile dev
[21:30:08] <d3nial> cool
[21:30:14] <xsamurai> how does one assign to a variable which contains a number and hyphens ?, http://jsfiddle.net/8ULVB/
[21:30:18] <d3nial> pyquery seems clumsy and unfinished?
[21:31:01] <w00tner> html5 + css3 + jquery + mongodb + json data + restful web services & phonegap
[21:32:34] <tw2113> you forgot cobol w00tner
[21:34:05] <w00tner> im naked i dont remember cobol right now
[21:36:01] <xsamurai> naked is the only way one programs cobol
[21:40:37] <Hans_Henrik> xsamurai: was cobol inspired by brainfuck or something?
[21:40:57] <Hans_Henrik> (just checked a hello world program, and it looks worse than java :p)
[21:42:33] <xsamurai> Hans_Henrik: I havent touched cobol since college, just did the assignments and erased everything from memory after that, all I remember is that it was very ugly
[21:45:03] <coldhead> those aren't valid characters in a symbol, xsamurai
[21:45:22] <xsamurai> coldhead: thanks , i forgot about using []
[21:45:23] <coldhead> - will be interpreted as subtraction
[21:45:31] <coldhead> oh good
[21:47:44] <MeMReS> I thought $("#myelement") was short for getElementById("#myelement") how do i access the properties like i would on get element by id using jQuery style selecting?
[21:48:00] <Cork> $("#myelement")[0]
[21:48:27] <Cork> if you want the raw dom element that is
[21:48:37] <Cork> and its getElementById("myelement") not getElementById("#myelement")
[21:49:46] <MeMReS> >.< typo.. thanks Cork
[21:50:50] <MeMReS> I haven't seen a Dev chat since AOL, this make me happy :)
[21:54:39] <ak5> hi guys, I have a div with an id of #text. Inside the div, I have Lorem ipsum. I want to highlight the next word, starting at word 1, everytime a key is pressed. Do I need to add <span></span> around each word?
[22:00:12] <MobCat> wat?
[22:00:39] <MeMReS> your refreshing the content in the div everytime anyway aren't you?
[22:03:04] <ak5> No
[22:03:09] <aqeel> hi room
[22:03:19] <ak5> It's kinda like a karaoke thing
[22:04:40] <MeMReS> I'd imagine you'd stick the lyrics in an array using space as your delimiter
[22:05:07] <ak5> yes
[22:05:53] <ak5> then I identify the word, then hilight it inside the div, however, there may be multiple instances of the same word
[22:07:02] <MeMReS> they're in sequence, why identify them at all.. use the index value
[22:11:46] <coldhead> good work everyone, let's all take five
[22:12:11] <abjorn> way ahead of you
[22:12:18] <MobCat> lol
[22:13:57] <fotoflo> hi all, simple question, can i use jQuery.get or some other function to pull a whole remote page ?
[22:14:19] <abjorn> yeah
[22:14:25] <abjorn> ajax request is just an http request
[22:17:34] <aqeel> fotoflo: you cannot pull the head section and yes the entire body you can
[22:17:43] <ak5> MeMReS: I understand I can use the sequence value, I just don't understand how I can then hilight the nth word in a div
[22:18:35] <fotoflo> aqueel: with $.get?
[22:19:42] <Cork> fotoflo: you can fetch a full html page, the problem is with what to do with it
[22:19:54] <fotoflo> cork: let me worry about that :-)
[22:20:02] <Cork> fotoflo: you can't add a full page to you're current page, cause that would be invalid
[22:20:07] <w00tner> i want to die
[22:20:40] <MeMReS> use a loop to reconstruct the lyrics, wrap some span tags around the word and drop it into the div, then clear the div and repeat for the next word
[22:20:45] * Cork gives w00tner a toon hammer
[22:21:04] <fotoflo> Cork: i don't want to do thatâ€¦ i just want to get some info from the pageâ€¦ but the problem I'm having is I'm never getting to debuggers in either function: $.get({url:url, success: function(){}, error:function(){}})
[22:21:18] <ak5> MeMReS: oh, yeah ok
[22:21:27] <Cork> ?.ajax @ fotoflo
[22:21:27] <bot-t> fotoflo, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:22:14] <Cork> fotoflo: get doesn't handle the error key
[22:22:43] <Cork> you could do $.get(url).done(function(){}).fail(function(){}}) though
[22:24:55] <fotoflo> Cork: cross origin...
[22:25:33] <Cork> heh
[22:25:35] <Cork> ya
[22:25:45] <Cork> that was my next guess :)
[22:27:20] <fotoflo> jsonp can't be used to get the full text of a web page can it?
[22:27:56] <coldhead> it can if the remote server supports it
[22:28:08] <coldhead> wikipedia does, for example
[22:32:04] <abjorn> >mfw netflix isn't loading
[22:32:07] <abjorn> WHAT HAS MY LIFE BECOME
[22:32:13] <MobCat> you are finished

[22:33:02] <MobCat> wat
[22:33:10] <MobCat> is that your code?
[22:33:29] <davemo> fotoflo: ? $.load
[22:34:02] <davemo> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[22:35:11] <fotoflo> don't want the html placed anywyere
[22:35:30] <MobCat> huh?
[22:36:37] <ak5> should I use a ternary operator if I just want to return if false? what do I tell it to do when true?
[22:37:24] <coldhead> ternary's aren't great for readability and they're especially bad to return from
[22:37:32] <davemo> if(false) { return true; } ?
[22:37:45] <coldhead> return ?: is okay; ? return sdsd : returen asdasd; is awful
[22:37:53] <ak5> so I need to wrap my entire code in if {} ?
[22:38:08] <coldhead> i don't know which code you're talking about
[22:38:19] <ak5> of course you don't :D
[22:38:36] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[22:38:38] <davemo> wrap all the codes
[22:38:39] <davemo> in ifs
[22:38:41] <davemo> all the time
[22:38:44] <davemo> #bestpractice
[22:38:50] <ak5> It's my second :D also I met you here yesterday :D
[22:38:55] <coldhead> that's a kind of haiku
[22:39:04] <davemo> :D
[22:39:07] <coldhead> i think i'd remember if i was here yesterday, ak5
[22:39:22] <ak5> you helped me with my problem yesterday :D
[22:39:33] <coldhead> that hardly sounds like the kind of thing i'd do
[22:39:42] <coldhead> but thank you for thinking so
[22:40:59] <ak5> if (counter > text.len) { return }; <-- can I do something like this within a codeblock that executes on('click')
[22:41:11] <ak5> so that the rest of the code below is NOT exectued?
[22:41:36] <davemo> you can always return early
[22:42:42] <Cork> ak5: yes, that's totally valid
[22:43:00] <Cork> ak5: and is actually the only time you should be using return in event handlers
[22:43:57] <noregret> any ideas of a FF plugin where I can send ajax requsts ?
[22:44:22] <Cork> ctrl + shift + k ?
[22:44:27] <MobCat> ya
[22:50:44] <coldhead> OH GOD @ EVERYTHING
[22:51:17] <abjorn> I KNOW
[22:51:18] <abjorn> ;-;
[22:53:42] <deanclkclk> I have a question
[22:53:53] <deanclkclk> how can I accomplish vertical scroll with jquery?
[22:54:04] <MobCat> in what context?
[22:54:13] <MobCat> you want to make a div scrollable with content inside?
[22:56:50] <MobCat> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[22:56:55] <MobCat> I really like this plugin does it very smoothly
[22:57:11] <MobCat> if you're trying to make scrolls occur after some event
[22:57:52] <vladikoff> MobCat, that plugin is older than some of the users in this channel
[22:58:31] <MobCat> lol
[22:58:49] <MobCat> what should I use instead?
[22:59:40] <deanclkclk> yeah MobCat that's the idea
[22:59:44] <deanclkclk> let me see the plugin
[23:01:58] <MobCat> http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[23:02:11] <MobCat> older than dirt but works for me
[23:12:53] <ak5> Cork: thanks
[23:12:55] <coldhead> old but good
[23:13:06] <coldhead> much like myself or someone i guess idk

[23:13:51] <coldhead> There is a blacksmith and there is a shepherd and there is a butcher-boy
[23:13:51] <coldhead> And there is a barber who's cutting and cutting away at my only joy
[23:13:57] <Cork> MobCat: ya scrollTo is really old, and really good
[23:14:14] <MobCat> i was feelng lonely here
[23:14:36] <frewsxcv> Is it common to have a class that manages all the ui aspects for large scale websites? Is it common to break them up across several classes?
[23:15:08] <frewsxcv> I feel like my UI logic is coupled too much with my core logic
[23:15:15] <frewsxcv> Any ideas?
[23:16:17] <ak5> I am trying to figure out why jplayer doesn't reset head when I click on stop, even after adding the function to reset head I found in docs
[23:17:30] <MobCat> ask in jwplayer forum
[23:17:32] <MobCat> not here
[23:17:50] <MobCat> er jplayer
[23:24:13] <coldhead> frewsxcv: i link to think of the CSS as a tool i use when building elements
[23:24:36] <coldhead> so i think "oh okay, i need a box with a form in it here... which classes do i need to add to make it style itself"
[23:25:00] <coldhead> whether that's global decisions or module decisions depends on the application
[23:25:13] <coldhead> mostly i just like not having to write or rewrite much
[23:27:49] <w00tner> i have this div where i drag and drop images and text... is there anyway to just capture the whole are into an image ??
[23:28:18] <MobCat> huh?
[23:33:32] <w00tner> i have this div where i drop and overlay divs, color... images and text.. customized .. is there anyway to just capture the area ?
[23:37:54] <coldhead> $('#capturing_div').html() should return the contents WITH the style attributes jQuery would have added
[23:37:58] <coldhead> if you styled via jQuery
[23:38:09] <coldhead> but that won't get any styles from stylesheets
[23:38:24] <coldhead> you're doing a tricky thing, excuse me if i misunderstand the question
[23:40:19] <w00tner> im doing this: http://www.ivanmartinez.net/w0rk/per0412/
[23:40:42] <w00tner> you can upload you image and drag and drop it to a preview div containing images
[23:40:49] <w00tner> you can change color text, etc
[23:41:32] <w00tner> is there anyway when the user finishes to customize his case take a picture of the divs ??
[23:41:46] <w00tner> because if its not i lost 4 days of my life
[23:42:18] <coldhead> No lo entiendo
[23:42:27] <coldhead> oh right
[23:42:29] <coldhead> client side?
[23:42:32] <coldhead> i don't think there is
[23:42:34] <w00tner> yes Â¨
[23:42:48] <w00tner> is there anyway ?
[23:42:59] <coldhead> http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/
[23:43:02] <coldhead> something like that
[23:43:06] <coldhead> haven't tried it
[23:43:24] <w00tner> im actualy there
[23:43:35] <MobCat> it won't work with flash or other plugins I don't think
[23:43:54] <w00tner> so is like html2canvas and then canvas2image
[23:43:59] <coldhead> yes!
[23:44:06] <w00tner> holy shrimp
[23:44:08] <coldhead> getting a png from canvas is easy
[23:44:17] <coldhead> but getting stuff into canvas ...
[23:44:21] <coldhead> a matter for yourself
[23:44:26] <w00tner> hehehe
[23:44:28] <coldhead> and on that bombshell
[23:44:48] <w00tner> i have been trying for like 24 hours straight
[23:45:35] <w00tner> http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/tests/z-index3.html
[23:46:31] <w00tner> i have like a 20 secs brain lag
[23:46:40] <MobCat> lul
[23:47:10] <w00tner> sudenly i realized that im staring to the same spot
[23:47:15] <w00tner> just staring
[23:47:30] <MobCat> right on
[23:47:46] <w00tner> someday
[23:58:19] <w00tner>  i will pay two dollars to the first that helps me capturing the stage
