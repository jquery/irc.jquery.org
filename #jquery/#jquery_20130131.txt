[00:00:00] <djQuery> this way you aren't applying datepicker repeated to items that dont need to have it
[00:00:24] <djQuery> removeing datepicker on those ones that have not been cloned might lead to memory leaks
[00:00:53] <gf3> If you're cloning them, could you not just store a reference to the new element?
[00:00:59] <gf3> vs. looking them up again
[00:01:11] <djQuery> gf3 good point
[00:01:23] <djQuery> raver1, ^^^^^^
[00:02:33] <mooseware> someone who is familiar with IE 8, $.ajax and 'Object doesn't support this property or method' issues?
[00:02:57] <djQuery> which property or method?
[00:03:38] <djQuery> greek, do you use javascript unit testing
[00:03:40] <mooseware> djQuery: this is the error which IE 8 gives me
[00:03:44] <mooseware> Object doesn't support this property or method
[00:03:56] <djQuery> popup or in console
[00:03:57] <ravenzz> ?demo
[00:03:57] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:04:18] <mooseware> will create a demo
[00:04:20] <ravenzz> morning :p
[00:04:39] <djQuery> ravenzz, is 2 am considered morning?
[00:05:01] <raver1> sorry, was afk.. djQuery good suggestion, i'll apply the class suggestion, cannot use templates to to dinamically added elements from php, so i never know what's inside, so i must repliace the first div and then replace ids and field names
[00:05:14] <mooseware> djQuery ravenzz do you have IE 8 available?
[00:05:29] <raver1> going afk again, have a shitload to do and only 3 hours until presentation :/
[00:05:30] <ravenzz> oh no that's late late night I guess :f
[00:05:35] <ravenzz> mooseware I have
[00:05:39] <greek> djQuery, nope, how come? A bit of  a newbie so please enlighten me
[00:05:56] <mooseware> ok, then please go to https://demo.crefocloud.de
[00:06:08] <mooseware> username and password is both "demo"
[00:06:13] <djQuery> greek, are you familar with unit testing at all?
[00:07:22] <ravenzz> mooseware ok, how can I reproduce the issue?
[00:07:50] <mooseware> ravenzz: try to log in with ie 8 and mentioned credentials
[00:07:55] <djQuery> ravenzz, well evidently you need ie to start with lol ie8 at that
[00:07:59] <ravenzz> mooseware done
[00:08:09] <mooseware> it works?
[00:08:13] <ravenzz> yes?
[00:08:19] <mooseware> no way!!
[00:08:39] <ravenzz> I can try one more time
[00:08:53] <djQuery> what browser are u using ravenzz
[00:08:55] <greek> djQuery, I am vaguely familiar with it. Will that help me make the decision with regards to whether I should bite the bullet and upgrade all our custom modules now or later?
[00:09:02] <ravenzz> what is the dutch for logout?
[00:09:09] <mooseware> are you sure you have a real IE8? I mean, we have several VMs here which have a real IE 8 installed and it doesnt work
[00:09:13] <mooseware> "Abmelden"
[00:09:14] <geiregjo> Is there a way to open the new jquery mobile panels by default?
[00:09:17] <ravenzz> djQuery ie9 > ie8 mode
[00:09:27] <mooseware> ravenzz: ok, thats the issue
[00:09:31] <djQuery> greek, you could develop unit tests for you diffent items pluck the new version of jquery in it and run th etests
[00:09:34] <geiregjo> Maybe with some data attribute (data-open="true")
[00:09:35] <mooseware> IE 9 is working
[00:09:46] <ravenzz> but I am testing in IE8 mode
[00:09:55] <mooseware> thats no real IE 8, sorry
[00:10:03] <djQuery> greek, but what error are you having with it right now
[00:11:33] <greek> Well from version 1.8 to 1.9 our dialogues in jqueryui aren't opening, and _many_ of our draggable widgets have had their events revamped as well
[00:11:34] <djQuery> greek, this is what jquery ui uses to test with  http://qunitjs.com/
[00:11:43] <greek> Ok thanks I'll check that out
[00:12:38] <djQuery> greek, yes ther have been some breaking changes that have been announced for a while in jquery ui
[00:12:50] <ravenzz> mooseware I don't get why would you do the login in ajax though
[00:13:38] <greek> djQuery, our fault for not tracking the jquery news! :)
[00:13:42] <greek> thanks for the tips
[00:14:26] <djQuery> give me reproducable demos and I probably give you some solutions
[00:14:30] <djQuery> greek, ^^
[00:14:34] <mooseware> ravenzz frankly, we are thinking about removing this, right. so you do not have an explanation why this fails?
[00:14:55] <ravenzz> I am not able to reproduce the issue
[00:14:57] <ravenzz> :(
[00:15:14] <djQuery> greek, but unit testing will allow you to know where your issues are without having a large QA team or that your customers are calling you
[00:16:24] <ravenzz> mooseware try to wrap your js with an IIFE eg. (function ($) { /* your code */ }(jQuery));
[00:16:42] <ravenzz> also use .on instead of .bind
[00:17:16] <djQuery> mooseware, is this a credit fixing agency?
[00:17:36] <mooseware> djQuery: this is the top one german credit rating agency, yes.
[00:18:08] <djQuery> Dear Customer, We believe securing your date is one of our most important tasks. We have detected that you are not running blah blah blah
[00:18:26] <djQuery> please follow this link to upgrade your browser
[00:19:00] <mooseware> djQuery: Creditreform uses IE 8… unf. we are not able to change their IT dep meaning…
[00:19:12] <djQuery> lolololol
[00:19:12] <mooseware> eh, not meaning… view
[00:19:45] <djQuery> mooseware, not saying its the answer but it sure would help
[00:20:01] <ravenzz> that's crazy :s
[00:20:05] <mooseware> djQuery: yes, imagine how much grey hair I now have...
[00:20:41] <ravenzz> you see these companies that invest an huge amount of money in security and then uses IE8
[00:20:53] <mooseware> ravenzz exactly
[00:21:15] <litenull> :)
[00:21:18] <djQuery> ravenzz, I used to support a call tracking package that only ran on IE
[00:21:25] <romano> :)
[00:21:37] <ravenzz> it is its own business anyway
[00:22:55] <ravenzz> djQuery which is not nice. I am sick of those kind of developers
[00:23:17] <marcules> Morning
[00:23:28] <djQuery> ravenzz, im not nice?
[00:23:53] <ravenzz> you are :p did you code that?
[00:24:07] <djQuery> well at least in germany ie8 seems to only have about 7 to 8% market share
[00:24:23] <ravenzz> well it is not about IE7/8
[00:24:24] <djQuery> ravenzz, no I only worked the help desk
[00:24:43] <djQuery> I know, used to have to field this call all the time
[00:25:11] <mooseware> HA!
[00:25:23] <mooseware> guys, found it… Date.now() caused that...
[00:25:46] <djQuery> "I am sorry which military branch did you say you were with? What do you mean you can't upgrade to IE whatever
[00:25:55] <ravenzz> you can always support it... I am complaining about people whom code for specific browsers or don't follow progressive enhancement practises, semantic html and stuff
[00:26:21] <ravenzz> mooseware new Date();
[00:26:24] <ravenzz> :?
[00:26:36] <djQuery> ravenzz, this was back when browsers were all about doing new stuff on thier own without standards
[00:26:41] <ili> hi everyone! not sure if this is the right place to ask - but if you click the contact button on this webpage you should have a form open up. I know the it's working but it seems to go off the page when it opens. this is non-technical language because i'm not sure of the best way to describe what's happening, but i don't want it to go of the page. would appreciate a bit of a push in the right direction. i drastically changed the them
[00:26:41] <ili> e code to get a full-page background happening. http://olamedia.no-ip.org/ladyfestbrisbane/
[00:26:51] <mooseware> yeah, changed that ravenzz thanks. but that so annoying!
[00:26:53] <zenoamaro> ravenzz: also it's more often than not a call from upper management...
[00:27:00] <ravenzz> mooseware remember to parseInt
[00:27:27] <mooseware> sure
[00:28:28] <zenoamaro> ravenzz: or down below from the IT crypt
[00:28:38] <litenull> ili: your top css property is weird
[00:28:52] <djQuery> ili, looks like someone decided to roll thier own modal dialog
[00:29:00] <litenull> are you dynamically incrementing the top ?
[00:29:01] <ravenzz> eh right
[00:29:34] <ravenzz> I should start to work I guess
[00:29:40] <ravenzz> bbl
[00:30:26] <djQuery> did they set the top to exactly 50%?
[00:30:29] <djQuery> of the page?
[00:30:41] <djQuery> nopers nm
[00:30:44] <ili> oh maybe thats what i did - the background images?
[00:31:00] <litenull> how are you setting the top ?
[00:31:49] <ili> sorry - the top? i don't know what that means - just using modal from zurb
[00:31:53] <murtaza_> hello sir i am using jquery choosen and i want to select particular option how i can do it
[00:31:57] <swz> hello, i made a horizontal scrolling website with jQuery (http://www.eskuvoi-video.hu/) and im trying to optimize it (caching, chaining, merging) but its still laggy when using the site controls (arrows or menu items)..is it because im using html5 player, external js gallery too and its heavy to load?
[00:31:58] <ili> have i set a css class called top?
[00:32:08] <litenull> ili: the top property of your dialog
[00:32:26] <murtaza_> hello sir i am using jquery choosen and i want to select particular option how i can do it
[00:32:43] <Trisox> hey djQuery and litenull o/
[00:32:46] <swz> http://www.eskuvoi-video.hu/js/engine.js <- This is link of the engine
[00:32:50] <litenull> hi :)
[00:32:55] <djQuery> Trisox, hey
[00:32:58] <Trisox> heyz
[00:33:07] <ili> ohhh just using what i hope is zurb standard code
[00:33:19] <djQuery> litenull, he is using this plugin http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin
[00:33:58] <Trisox> murtaza_: define select
[00:34:17] <noregret> is there any recommended paginatin plugin?
[00:34:20] <ili> http://pastebin.com/QUHVEBEX
[00:34:30] <litenull> djQuery: yes but this is working fine
[00:34:47] <litenull> ili: did you add your own stuff to this addon ?
[00:34:54] <Trisox> i always use jquery ui dialog or fancybox
[00:35:04] <ili> i added shortcode for the form
[00:35:31] <litenull> the top property is too high.. dunno what is causing this :)
[00:35:39] <djQuery> the form is appearing partialy off the screen because it is so big, even for my screen resolution
[00:36:02] <ili> ah so if i re-size the form that might fix it?
[00:36:04] <djQuery> try reducing the space between form fields?
[00:36:15] <djQuery> ili potentialy
[00:36:28] <djQuery> put labels beside the inputs
[00:36:48] <ili> ok yeah thanks i'll go do that and see if it fixes it cheers
[00:37:38] <djQuery> Trisox, whatcha been up to
[00:37:56] <Trisox> not much doing some psd to html conversion
[00:37:56] <djQuery> never had so much of issue making a unit test fail before
[00:38:04] <Trisox> meaning writing some pages
[00:38:16] <Trisox> nothing special :)
[00:39:06] <djQuery> Trisox, sorry whats psd
[00:39:27] <Trisox> photoshop file
[00:39:55] <djQuery> have allways tried to stay away from those
[00:40:58] <litenull> i hate this :) converting psd to html is always frustrating
[00:40:59] <djQuery> well I have figured out how to fix a bug in ui.dialog but I can submit the pull request till I figure out how to right a unit test
[00:41:08] <djQuery> that shows it failing in the first place
[00:41:09] <litenull> especially on IE
[00:41:21] <Trisox> djQuery: haha :)
[00:41:33] <Trisox> i do interaction design and frontend
[00:42:41] <litenull> no backend ? :)
[00:42:48] <Trisox> no ;)
[00:43:06] <Trisox> i like to stay away form that
[00:43:09] <litenull> thats cool, here we make everything on our own :)
[00:43:34] <litenull> apis, frontend
[00:43:40] <litenull> cross platform html5
[00:43:42] <litenull> etc
[00:43:45] <Trisox> sweet
[00:44:05] <Trisox> i want to learn more mvc stuff
[00:44:13] <Trisox> angularjs for instance
[00:44:17] <litenull> its sweet till you use third party stuff, like paid apis
[00:44:28] <Trisox> :p
[00:44:35] <Trisox> brb geting some coffee
[00:44:51] <litenull> i usually flood the support on every f*ing third party stuff
[00:44:51] <litenull> :)
[00:45:00] <litenull> its always buggy
[00:46:37] <litenull> its funny how the slogan of the api is: "STATE OF ART, SIMPLE, COMMPACT"
[00:47:31] <litenull> its always lies
[00:47:57] <litenull> spent 2 months per each "hipster" framework, api
[00:49:58] <alex88> hi guys, I'm in this case http://jsfiddle.net/Cwjm7/ where I want to make a link clickable, is there a way to do that without changing the #container z-index?
[00:50:13] <alex88> since the parent has a lower z-index, overlay is placed above
[00:51:14] <djQuery> alex88, well you could track the exact movements of the mouse and fire of the click on the overlay
[00:51:45] <alex88> djQuery, so you mean find when it clicks on the same position of the <a>?
[00:51:56] <greek> djQuery, we're busy researching that unit testing tip you gave us, thanks. Could I pick your brain a little further? With the jquery / jqueryui updates, we can see that from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0 we'll need to update our code, but when it's from 1.8.0 to 1.8.1, to 1.8.2... are we still safe using 1.8.0? In other words, is it an ok strategy to only plan upgrades from one base version "1.8" (not sure what it's called) to "1.9"?
[00:52:04] <djQuery> then if they clicked in the same general are that the link is in you could $('a').trigger('click');
[00:52:07] <Cork> alex88: depends on how much cross browser support you need
[00:52:31] <alex88> oh, cork, here also :) btw, ie 7+?
[00:52:35] <alex88> asking too much? :)
[00:52:45] <djQuery> alex88, what I am trying to say is yes you can but don't
[00:52:52] <Cork> alex88: then no there isn't a way
[00:53:07] <alex88> ok, so let me play more with css
[00:53:12] <litenull> why are you guys supporting ie 7 ? educate your client
[00:53:15] <alex88> thanks anyway guys
[00:53:31] <Cork> but if you can live with newer browsers you have pointer-events
[00:53:36] <Cork> ?mdc pointer-events
[00:53:40] <bot-t> Cork, pointer-events - CSS | MDN - The CSS property pointer-events allows authors to control under what circumstances (if any) a particular graphic element can become the target of mouse events. When this property is unspecified, th... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/pointer-events
[00:53:41] <alex88> litenull, web service, so everyone can be a client.. and educate all of them can be a PITA :)
[00:54:08] <alex88> Cork, thanks for the tips, I'll check that!
[00:54:16] <litenull> alex88: we actually fire the IE7 thing right away, "install a new browser, its a security issue" and thats it
[00:54:18] <djQuery> http://saveie6.com
[00:54:30] <Cork> alex88: pointer_events: none; on the covering element and it would work
[00:54:34] <Cork> but not on ie < 9
[00:54:35] <djQuery> greek, in most cases yes but not in all
[00:54:59] <djQuery> greek, it would be a good idea to subscribe to the jquery ui and the jquery blogs
[00:55:10] <alex88> Cork, sorry, forgot to mention, events like click, touch etc, needs to work on the covering element outside the <a> place
[00:55:21] <Cork> ah
[00:55:22] <djQuery> most breaking changes are announced weeks if not months ahead of time
[00:55:33] <litenull> djQuery: your link made me sad
[00:55:33] <Cork> then no that would make it impossible without z-index
[00:55:37] <litenull> :)
[00:55:53] <Cork> alex88:
[00:55:55] <litenull> im going to ddos this site
[00:55:55] <djQuery> litenull, go through the download wizard to make yourself happy
[00:55:58] <Cork> alex88: http://jsfiddle.net/Cwjm7/1/
[00:55:59] <alex88> Cork, can I pm you an example link? (don't want to share publicly)
[00:56:08] * Cork hits his keyboard
[00:56:34] <Cork> ok
[00:57:14] * djQuery watches Cork become personal support rep for free
[00:57:15] <greek> djQuery, ok will do. And then secondly, is it silly thinking that these major version upgrades (1.8 -> 1.9) follow a general schedule (ie: quarterly / bi-annually), or is it totally random?
[00:57:37] <Trisox> Cork: o/
[00:57:39] <djQuery> greek, they are trying to release more often and smaller
[00:58:21] <djQuery> but in my experience they havent paid much attention to schedules in the past
[00:58:28] <djQuery> think its getting better now
[00:58:47] <Cork> alex88: well, you won't be able to make that work anyway
[00:58:55] <djQuery> think they have all the blockers done for 1.9.10 and allready working on 1.9.11
[00:58:57] <Cork> ie will ignore the covering element as its transparent
[00:59:11] <greek> djQuery, that's great if one only works on a handful of sites. We have a couple hundred custom modules, so our scheduling the time to conduct an upgrade would be ideally suited to "January and July" as opposed to the 1st day of each month, if that makes sense.
[00:59:32] <alex88> Cork, with pointer-events none or the actual state of the page?
[00:59:56] <Cork> alex88: ie checks for transparency on an element
[00:59:59] <greek> In other words, upgrading jQuery across all our modules is going to take a lot of time, so I'd rather we do it once or twice a year for each major version change as opposed to all the time
[01:00:00] <djQuery> greek, some of the sites that run jquery would be = to a couple hundred
[01:00:06] <djQuery> some big sites use it
[01:00:07] <alex88> Cork, but that page works on ie
[01:00:09] <Cork> and if its completely transparent it will ignore it
[01:00:10] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, I've had some success, http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/CQkL8/8/ now correctly counts down the hours to 11am, however it still effectively "restarts" the countdown from the whole hour (currently 4) on each refresh, why?
[01:00:17] <alex88> or at least, some older versions were working
[01:00:19] <alex88> also on ie6
[01:00:19] <greek> djQuery, fair point
[01:00:35] <litenull> fRAiLtY-: omg stilllll :)
[01:00:37] <greek> I guess this is more of a project management question :) I don't mean to bug you with such things
[01:00:38] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: did you compleatly miss the link i sent you yesterday?
[01:00:50] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  eugh, I might have done
[01:00:54] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Do you still have it
[01:01:00] <fRAiLtY-> litenull:  I'm afraid so, think how I feel!
[01:01:10] <litenull> fRAiLtY-: i know
[01:01:11] <litenull> :)
[01:01:14] <Cork> different comp, though i might find it in the log
[01:01:18] <djQuery> aren't there enough count down timers out there
[01:01:35] <fRAiLtY-> litenull:  I wish I'd have been a tradesman, I now hate the internet and all associated things
[01:01:42] <litenull> :D
[01:02:08] <Cork> [18:59:22] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/9/
[01:02:34] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I could kiss you
[01:02:38] <litenull> fRAiLtY-: how much time are you developing
[01:02:39] <litenull> ?
[01:03:02] <fRAiLtY-> litenull:  Currently around 12hrs a day, although I'm new to JS. I used to love it, but now I just can't wait to go home
[01:03:07] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Can you explain what you did?
[01:04:00] <litenull> fRAiLtY-: get used to the flow, in my 12 years i have seen it all. just take it easy, its always gonna be bugz :))
[01:04:21] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you want to count to hole hour so you need to zero out minutes, seconds and miliseconds (141 - 143)
[01:04:52] <Cork> if you don't you will count from the offset your currently at
[01:05:03] <Cork> and that was why it reset each reload
[01:05:29] <djQuery> IK think it is running too fast on my machine
[01:06:19] <Cork> djQuery: its based on your computer clock so...
[01:07:11] <djQuery> Cork,  remember those old clocks before digital
[01:07:19] <Cork> heh
[01:07:47] <djQuery> but still displayed like digital    big wheel of numbers that would flip down constantly
[01:07:49] <litenull> its working fine for me
[01:07:55] <Cork> do you remember those clocks that came after digital clocks? :D
[01:08:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  It was that simple?
[01:08:44] <djQuery> here is one http://yoshimichi.blogspot.com/2012/07/big-flip-old-digital-display-clock-from.html
[01:09:01] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes :)
[01:09:18] <fRAiLtY-> Jeez I've got so much to learn, how long have you been working with JS/jQuery
[01:10:22] <Cork> djQuery: have you ever heard of byte time?
[01:10:33] <Cork> (also known as internet time)
[01:11:11] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time
[01:11:28] <litenull> wow, never heard of this
[01:11:49] <Cork> a day is from 0 - 1000
[01:11:55] <Cork> :)
[01:12:13] <litenull> yes im reading
[01:12:15] <litenull> cool
[01:12:16] <litenull> :)
[01:12:17] <Cork> 2 pm was ca @600
[01:12:30] <Cork> (gmt +1)
[01:13:07] <Cork> the time format was based on Switz
[01:13:13] <Cork> instead of gmt

[01:17:52] <brantje> if you ise $(  'body'  ).airport([ 'moscow', 'berlin', 'stockholm' ]);
[01:17:57] <brantje> it uses the body
[01:18:21] <litenull> brantje: i hope this is only the fiddle :)
[01:18:31] <fattest> brantje: do i need another js file for the airport
[01:18:31] <brantje> litenull me too :P
[01:18:48] <brantje> No, but you need to specify the target class or id
[01:18:52] <litenull> fattest: where are you appending the airport
[01:18:59] <litenull> on your website
[01:19:05] <litenull> on body
[01:19:05] <litenull> ?
[01:19:18] <fattest> litenull: yes on my website
[01:19:26] <fattest> litenull: yes body
[01:19:30] <brantje> ...
[01:19:30] <litenull> its wrong
[01:19:30] <litenull> :)
[01:19:35] <brantje> indeed
[01:19:37] <litenull> make a div
[01:19:37] <fattest> i put it in my body
[01:19:44] <brantje> fattest
[01:19:48] <litenull> <div id="yolo">
[01:19:48] <brantje> do it like this
[01:19:58] <brantje> <div id="airport">
[01:19:59] <litenull> $('#yolo').airport()
[01:19:59] <fattest> <script type='text/javascript' src='Includes/Javascript/Airport/Java.js'></script>         <script type='text/javascript' src="Includes/Javascript/Airport/Airport.js"></script>
[01:20:04] <brantje> indeed :P
[01:20:16] <litenull> :D
[01:20:19] <Cork> uhh include Java?!?
[01:20:27] <litenull> hahaha
[01:20:31] <fattest> do i need these: <script type='text/javascript'>//<![CDATA[  window.addEvent('load', function() {
[01:20:33] <litenull> Java VM ? XD
[01:20:33] <brantje> O_o
[01:20:42] <fattest> do i need it
[01:20:57] <litenull> fattest: do the div thingđ
[01:20:59] <litenull> thing*
[01:21:03] <fattest> um
[01:21:10] <fattest> litenull: doin it now
[01:21:11] <litenull> add a div where you want the air..
[01:21:14] <HexSquid> Shouldn't need the type='text/javascript' anymore
[01:21:26] <litenull> and
[01:21:30] <litenull> then append the airport
[01:21:32] <Cork> depends on how you look at it
[01:21:38] <fattest> litenull: whats the code for the airport
[01:21:39] <Cork> the browsers have a fallback for it
[01:21:49] <Cork> but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be there
[01:21:49] <litenull> fattest: <div id="yolo"></div>
[01:21:59] <brantje>  $('#yolo').airport()
[01:22:01] <fattest> litenull: not the div, t he airport
[01:22:02] <litenull> yes
[01:22:07] <fattest> ok
[01:22:48] <Trisox> :D
[01:22:49] <fattest> <div id="yolo"> $('#yolo').airport() </div>
[01:22:57] <litenull> no
[01:22:58] <litenull> :)
[01:23:00] <fattest> ??
[01:23:05] <fattest> im confused
[01:23:13] <litenull> fattest: <div id="yolo">YOLO</div>
[01:23:23] <litenull> fattest: and in js
[01:23:40] <litenull> fattest: $('#yolo').airport()
[01:23:53] <litenull> fattest: $('#yolo').airport('lala', 'lala')
[01:23:53] <fattest> <div id="yolo">YOLO</div> $('#yolo').airport() </div>
[01:23:56] <seutje> wtf happened to this channel?
[01:24:13] <fattest> <div id="yolo">YOLO</div> $('#yolo').airport('lala', 'lala') </div>
[01:24:16] <Cork> fattest: do you know how to write javascripts for webpages at all?
[01:24:20] <litenull> omg i cant do this anymore
[01:24:24] <fattest> cork: no im new
[01:24:32] <seutje> please stop
[01:24:34] <Cork> you should prob start looking at the basics
[01:24:35] <fattest> cork: i know how to copy and paste though
[01:24:43] <greek> djQuery, we are busy discussing another option here at work - that of never upgrading our custom modules. For example, if wrote a module for a client back in 20012 using jQuery 1.8, and that module never changes, then there's no pressing need to upgrade jQuery for that module. The question then becomes more a case of browser compatibility, because nothing stops our customer from upgrading to IE 15 in 5 years time. How serious is the risk of
[01:24:43] <greek>  future browsers not working with older version of jQuery?
[01:24:46] <Cork> fattest: sadly no, you don't
[01:24:54] <fattest> i do! from jsfiddle
[01:24:57] <Cork> as you don't know where you should paste it
[01:25:22] <seutje> copy skills won't get u anywhere without the paste skills to match them
[01:25:22] <Cork> fattest: you should start getting to know how javascript interacts with the dom of a page
[01:25:33] <fattest> litenull: when i opened my site in firefox, it showed tihs  YOLO $('#yolo').airport('lala', 'lala')
[01:25:36] <Cork> before you know that, you can't make a working ajax page
[01:25:40] <fattest> cork: is there online tutorials?
[01:25:43] <litenull> fattest: youre doing it wrong
[01:25:45] <Cork> sure
[01:25:55] <fattest> litenull: i put everytihng that you told me to
[01:25:56] <litenull> the JS is separated
[01:26:06] <fattest> <div id="yolo">YOLO</div> $('#yolo').airport('lala', 'lala') </div>
[01:26:07] <litenull> the script is separated from the dom
[01:26:12] <litenull> just do a div
[01:26:19] <litenull> <div id="someth"></div>
[01:26:21] <HexSquid> Woah woah woah, IE15 is 5 years time?
[01:26:26] <Cork> fattest: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery     http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[01:26:33] <HexSquid> I don't buy it
[01:26:40] <HexSquid> Maybe IE11
[01:26:55] <litenull> ands then do <script>$('#someth').airport('lala', 'lala')
[01:26:57] <Cork> HexSquid: and firefox ad chrome will hit 100 around that time
[01:27:00] <litenull> </script>
[01:27:01] <Cork> *and
[01:27:05] <seutje> fuck it, I'ma start filling ye olde ignore list with these yolo toddlers
[01:27:11] <fattest> litenull: <div id="yolo">YOLO</div> <script type="text/javascript">  </script> </div>
[01:27:17] <seutje> score!
[01:27:21] <litenull> are you trolling ?
[01:27:25] <Cork> prob
[01:27:27] <fattest> litenull: trolling?
[01:27:35] <litenull> im done :)
[01:27:37] <fattest> litenull: no its airport text
[01:27:42] <seutje> any more takers?
[01:27:45] <fattest> litenull: pls help, im new
[01:28:02] <fattest> litenull: can u do it in a jsfiddle please?
[01:28:09] <Cork> ignore fattest* all
[01:28:11] <Cork> opps
[01:28:19] <fattest> ?
[01:31:48] <NodeX> trololol
[01:31:57] <fattest> litenull: are u there
[01:32:05] <litenull> he's gone
[01:32:09] <fattest> litenull: 	$('#yolo').airport('lala', 'lala')
[01:32:37] <fattest> litenull: <div id="yolo"></div>
[01:32:49] <fattest> litenull: how about that?
[01:33:23] <fattest> what do u think
[01:34:23] <thedavidmeister> hey, I have a question about the jquery license
[01:34:37] <thedavidmeister> does anyone here know about that?
[01:34:50] <Cork> isn't just a normal mit license?
[01:34:58] * Cork googles
[01:35:03] <Cork> yup
[01:35:56] <mary__> hi there, does anyone know how to use .post() to write to a .css file on the serverside?  i.e. after an event, get some values and write to the .css file http://pastebin.com/kur7kRs8
[01:36:35] <Cork> mary__: you can't modify a server file from a website
[01:36:37] <litenull> mary__: why are you doing that ?
[01:36:58] <Cork> mary__: you can change changes to a server script that modifies server files; though thats quite often a bad idea
[01:37:04] <thedavidmeister> you would need to post to a script that does the modification for you
[01:37:05] <Cork> *you can send changes
[01:37:11] <mary__> hmm...
[01:37:17] <mary__> i'm using jquery with ExtJs
[01:37:24] <Cork> thats client side
[01:37:25] <mary__> via adobe CQ
[01:37:37] <litenull> why are you changing the css ?
[01:37:38] <is_null> hi all, is there a way to select all third <td> of a table ? I tried $('table td:eq(2)') but it only selects the third td of the first row
[01:37:41] <is_null> i need all rows
[01:38:02] <mary__> so the item i need to change the CSS to is a resizable/repositionable div
[01:38:05] <is_null> all third td of all rows of this table*
[01:38:24] <mary__> so after the user resizes/respositions it, i want to save that to the .css file...
[01:38:30] <mary__> i was wondering if that's possible with .post()
[01:39:50] <litenull> mary__: you must make a json api on the server side so you can transfer the changes, however you could save to localStorage
[01:39:58] <greek> The jqueryui blog has a convenient "Releases" category, whereas the jquery blog does not. Is there a reason? It would be really great if I could subscribe to a feed that only announces new releases and nothing else.
[01:40:24] <Cork> $('table td:nth-child(3)')
[01:40:35] <Cork> is_null: ^
[01:45:56] <brantje> mary__
[01:46:17] <brantje> like this: http://v3.friendstream.net/1index.html
[01:46:30] <is_null> Cork: nice, thanks !!
[01:46:46] <is_null> is there a function like html(), but that will also return the tag HTML ?
[01:47:12] <Cork> $('<div>').html($(selector).clone()).html()
[01:47:12] <is_null> ie. $('td').html() will only return contents of <td></td>, i need like '<td>foo</td>' instead of just 'foo'
[01:47:18] <is_null> nice, thanks
[01:47:20] <Cork> and no there isn't one
[01:47:31] <Cork> cause there isn't a cross browser method to get it
[01:47:41] <is_null> fantastic
[01:48:55] <fattest> Can someone please hlp me use airport javascript its soo hard
[01:57:04] <serdem> hi guys

[02:04:53] <greek> The jquery-ui blog has a convenient "Releases" category, whereas the jquery blog does not. Is there a reason? It would be really great if I could subscribe to a feed that only announces new releases and nothing else.
[02:05:58] <litenull> serdem: Response.AppendHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");

[02:07:17] <litenull> np
[02:08:19] <granden> Hi, if I got a table and on each row (<tr>) I got a few fields, like amount, percentage, price for example. I did $('.rowSum').on('keyup', '.price,.amount,.percentage', function(event){ how would I sum those three fields?  }
[02:10:51] <Cork> granden: you can't really sum through a delegated selector
[02:11:04] <Cork> you would have to loop over the matched elements and sum them
[02:12:29] <boulet101010> Wtf with jQuery.event.handle between 1.8.3 and 1.9.0???
[02:12:57] <Cork> boulet101010: if you mean global events; they've been dropped
[02:13:24] <turbi> anyone speak spanish?
[02:13:40] <granden> Cork: Ok, but If I got like that, and got 5 rows. How do I sum just those 3 fields for the current row?
[02:14:06] <Cork> granden: current based on what?
[02:14:08] <granden> maybe like .parent().each(){}?
[02:14:15] <granden> based on where the keyup is made
[02:14:20] <granden> in which text field
[02:14:30] <granden> that rows all those 3 fields
[02:14:32] <granden> I want to sum
[02:14:33] <Cork> ah those classes are input fields in td's ?
[02:14:55] <granden> Yes
[02:15:14] <granden> going to add more input fields later, but start with three, then the logic is there :)
[02:15:32] <litenull> do you have ids for these fields ?
[02:15:38] <Cork> $.map($(this).closest('tr').find('.price,.amount,.percentage'), function() { return $(this).val() });
[02:15:45] <boulet101010> what i meant is that when i use jquery-ui's accordion example with the "hoverintent" event definition, i don't know how to convert the "jQuery.event.handle.apply( that, args );" to the new system? i tried with "jQuery.event.handlers.apply( that, args );" but that doesn't work.
[02:16:04] <litenull> yep the closest.
[02:16:10] <litenull> as Cork said.
[02:16:10] <Cork> granden: that will return you an array with the different values
[02:16:16] <granden> Cork: Nice, thanks.
[02:16:42] <Cork> var values = $.map($(this).closest('tr').find('.price,.amount,.percentage'), function() { return $(this).val() }); values[0] * values[1] * values[2]
[02:17:35] <granden> Yeah, thanks a lot. One more thing just. :) I got a <span class='total'></span>
[02:17:40] <granden> in a td on the same row that I want to update
[02:17:52] <granden> how do I update just that total for the correct row?
[02:20:27] <granden> TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'elem.nodeName.toLowerCase')
[02:20:33] <granden> I get that using that .map
[02:20:41] <boulet101010> with 1.8.3 : http://jsfiddle.net/YceCV/ , with 1.9.0 : http://jsfiddle.net/YceCV/1/
[02:21:01] <Cork> did you do $.map($()) or $().map ?
[02:21:03] <boulet101010> may somebody tell me how to do the transition?
[02:21:15] <Cork> or $.map()
[02:21:42] <granden> $.map($(this).closest('tr')
[02:22:07] <greek> .attr() is deprecated, and will eventually be dropped, so how do we set custom attributes in the future?
[02:22:13] <Cork> granden: that should work
[02:22:40] <Cork> granden: what version of jquery?
[02:22:49] <Kambfhase> attr() is deprecated?
[02:22:53] <Cork> no
[02:23:13] <Cork> attr was split into command in 1.6
[02:23:15] <greek> Maybe I read it wrong:
[02:23:16] <greek> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#attr-versus-prop-
[02:23:31] <Cork> properties was moved out of attr into its own function
[02:23:46] <greek> Oh ok
[02:23:59] <greek> "jQuery 1.6 introduced the .prop() method for setting or getting properties on nodes and deprecated the use of .attr() to set properties. However, versions up to 1.9 continued to support using .attr() for specific situations." <- so .attr() is still here to stay, for those specific situations
[02:24:12] <Cork> ex. $('a').attr('href') will get the attribute (read on the html tag) value
[02:24:25] <Cork> ex. $('a').prop('href') will get the property from the dom element
[02:24:35] <Cork> as in what the browser corrects the value to
[02:24:41] <Cork> or what updates automatically
[02:24:54] <Kambfhase> You should not use custom attributes anyway. That leads to memory leaks in old IE (if you care about those)
[02:24:56] <Cork> like .checked on checkboxes
[02:25:05] <Cork> doesn't work on .attr, but works in .prop
[02:25:13] <greek> Ok interesting
[02:25:20] <greek> Kambfhase, noted
[02:25:24] <noregret> i got x=$(whatever).serializeArray(), how can I add to x another name:value pair ? i tried x.name = 'a' and x.value = 'b' but that didn't work out.. x is an array.. how can I add to it ?
[02:25:26] <Cork> Kambfhase: that is true in < ie7 not after
[02:25:44] <greek> Cork does this specific use of .attr() mean it's no longer deprecated
[02:25:52] <greek> For reading HTML
[02:25:55] <greek> as opposed to DOM
[02:25:55] <Kambfhase> Ok, not much of an issue then.
[02:25:55] <Cork> noregret: x.push({ name: '', value: '' })
[02:26:25] <Cork> greek: attr has never been depricated
[02:26:37] <Cork> greek: and its not reading dom vs readin dom
[02:26:45] <Cork> its reading dom attributes vs dom properties
[02:26:46] <noregret> Cork: great thanks, didn't know that exists
[02:27:05] <Cork> noregret: serializeArray returns an array with objects
[02:27:18] <greek> Cork well that attribute in the HTML that is parse into the DOM is what I meant
[02:27:20] <greek> but yeah I understand
[02:28:17] <Cork> they where split up into two separate functions cause depending on what situation your in you want one or the other
[02:28:28] <Cork> so if both are in the same command your screwed
[02:28:40] <Cork> thats why it was moved into a separate function
[02:29:21] <greek> Ok cool
[02:29:39] <greek> thanks for the insight. I totally misinterpreted that upgrade note.
[02:30:02] <Kambfhase> I can't think of a case, where you might want to set the attribute, but not change the property
[02:30:54] <Kambfhase> .attr() was fine, even though it might not have been technically correct
[02:31:29] <Kambfhase> This change just adds needless complexity
[02:32:01] <Cork> Kambfhase: add a <a href="#find-this-id">click me</a>
[02:32:07] <Cork> then select that one with .prop
[02:32:10] <Cork> and you see the problem
[02:32:28] <Cork> you will get http://www.example.com/full/path/to/file.html#find-this-id
[02:32:51] <Cork> so in that case you want .attr('href')
[02:34:43] <Kambfhase> I just mean, having to ways of doing nearly the same thing, fells kinda unjQueryish
[02:34:55] <Cork> your not doing the same thing
[02:35:01] <Cork> its quite different
[02:35:54] <Kambfhase> On a technical level, yes.
[02:35:54] <Cork> the problem is that attr made ppl think it was
[02:36:02] <mazzachre> Can anyone help me with this in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/p8jkW/2/ It only ever gets to the "single" event... Apparently the second time I click, $(this).data(..) does not return the value I set?!
[02:36:09] <mazzachre> It works in chrome and firefox
[02:37:15] <Cork> mazzachre: ie loses scope when you use timeout
[02:38:11] <Nancy2012> any idea guys related with this error  "SyntaxError: missing exponent" on following line…..  var tipo = [{cat: 'tigre'},{cat: 'l'elefante'}];
[02:38:16] <mazzachre> Ya, but I don't use the data in the timeout...
[02:38:32] <mazzachre> Does it loose scope for the funtion outside too?!
[02:38:39] <Cork> Nancy2012: 'l'elefante' <--
[02:38:44] <Nancy2012> yes
[02:38:52] <Nancy2012> problem is there..
[02:39:02] <Cork> Nancy2012: change that to "l'elefante" or 'l\'elefante'
[02:39:04] <Nancy2012> i need to know how can i cope with this conflict
[02:39:21] <mazzachre> Use double quotes or escape with \
[02:39:26] <Nancy2012> you mean.. i need to use addslashes() función
[02:39:54] <Nancy2012> do u  know it comes from DB
[02:40:06] <anli> Can I force open a datepicker?
[02:40:07] <mazzachre> Then yes, addslashes would help
[02:40:16] <anli> tried foo.click()
[02:40:24] <Nancy2012> thanks.. let me try
[02:40:39] <mazzachre> Cork: I found that trippleclick actually works in my example!
[02:40:49] <Cork> Nancy2012: you should be using json_encode if your doing that in php
[02:40:49] <HexSquid> 'l\'elefante'
[02:41:04] <Nancy2012> i am doing it on PHP
[02:41:11] <mazzachre> anli: You need to delay your click... so setTimeout(function() {$('foo').click();}, 100); would work
[02:41:12] <Nancy2012> thanks
[02:41:20] <anli> aha
[02:41:23] <anli> cool
[02:41:26] <anli> trying
[02:43:24] <anli> Hm, the delay did not help
[02:43:34] <anli> no datepicker popup
[02:44:26] <philhutchinson> anli: $("#element").datepicker('open');
[02:44:37] <anli> tried that before, trying in a delay func then
[02:44:49] <philhutchinson> or rather
[02:45:14] <anli> Error: TypeError: a.datepicker[(("_" + b) + "Datepicker")] is undefined
[02:45:26] <philhutchinson> $("#element").live('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $("#element").datepicker('show'); });
[02:45:38] <philhutchinson> what the hell is that (("_" + b) + "Datepicker")]
[02:45:53] <anli> datepicker("show") was the shit
[02:45:54] <anli> thanks!
[02:46:00] <anli> trying without delay
[02:46:16] <philhutchinson> $("#element").live('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $(this).datepicker('show'); });
[02:46:18] <anli> did without without
[02:46:20] <philhutchinson> should be able to use that
[02:46:21] <anli> oops
[02:46:23] <anli> did work without
[02:46:32] <anli> many thanks
[02:46:35] <philhutchinson> no worries
[02:46:39] <anli> :)
[02:50:00] <NodeX> live() is depreciated
[02:50:10] <turbi> anyone speak spanish?
[02:50:22] <NodeX> people in spain probably
[02:50:54] <Cork> s/depredated/dropped/
[02:51:04] <Cork> live was deprecated
[02:51:10] <Cork> not its removed
[02:54:40] <reloadz> hi! i use .ajax to send data - how can i make "waiting icon" to appear while data is being send! and when i get response back then waiting icon disapears?
[02:57:09] <Cork> relipse: you could bind a global ajaxStart and AjaxStop listener (think its .Stop)
[02:57:13] <Cork> ?.ajaxStop
[02:57:14] <bot-t> .ajaxStop(handler): Register a handler to be called when all Ajax requests have completed. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/

[02:57:39] <koopajah> Hi everyone! I'm having some issues when migratin to jQuery 1.8.3 in Chrome. I'm setting the width of a div to an integer value (example 802) but then, if I retrieve it's outerWidth/innerWidth it returns double value instead of integer : 804.9999997615814 . Does anyone have a clue on what can be the cause of this ?
[03:02:52] <jackjackw> guys what is the best way to capture the result of a getJSON call? store it as an array?
[03:03:12] <jackjackw> or just a global variable?
[03:04:03] <Phil-Work> jackjackw, how is the scope of the variable related to the type of data it stores? :S
[03:04:27] <Phil-Work> getJSON returns a parsed object or array
[03:04:34] <Phil-Work> store it in whatever scope is relevant to your application
[03:05:11] <noregret> anybody uses a good pagination plugin ?
[03:05:30] <jackjackw> Phil-Work, im creating a flickr CMS using jquery, im also a major noob with about a weeks experience under my belt, excuse my idiotic questions
[03:05:59] <anew> phil-work i thought the json object is an array
[03:06:25] <jackjackw> i call flickrs api for one set of values, and then for each of those values (photoset ids) i then call flickrs api again to get image data and then construct html from that
[03:06:53] <Phil-Work> anew, it's definately usually an object
[03:06:57] <Phil-Work> in fact, it might never be an array
[03:07:09] <anew> ah that's what i meant
[03:07:12] <Phil-Work> perhaps only if it's sequential numeric keys
[03:07:13] <steveccc> hi all - whats the nicest looking jquery lightbox solution which will display web pages in an iframe
[03:07:19] <anew> yeah object
[03:07:36] <anew> been doing to much perl lately
[03:07:40] <anew> #perlfail
[03:07:41] <Phil-Work> or, I assume, if the original representation was an array
[03:08:05] <Phil-Work> I get confused with it and PHP most of the time
[03:08:41] <koopajah> steveccc > i'm currently using colorbox
[03:09:52] <steveccc> koopajah: that looks good thanks - can you customise the background colour so its a dark semi transparent background?
[03:10:40] <jackjackw> steveccc yeah you can
[03:10:49] <jackjackw> just edit the colorbox css
[03:12:33] <koopajah> Sorry to ask again : anyone has a clue as to why chrome returns non integer inner/outerwidth ? i'm a bit lost here ^^'
[03:12:44] <anew> noninteger
[03:12:47] <anew> you mean like 1.34242
[03:12:51] <anew> for outer width
[03:12:53] <koopajah> anew > yeah
[03:13:01] <anew> dunno try #css
[03:13:15] <koopajah> k thanks
[03:15:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  You around?
[03:16:11] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: sure
[03:16:34] <granden> Cork: Jquery 1.8.3
[03:17:30] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  It was going so well, http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/9/ When 11am arrives, the counter doesn't restart from 24hrs, it then suffers the refresh issue again :x
[03:18:16] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: where do you restart the timer?
[03:18:40] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I just assumed that once 11am passes it would begin again as it's checking for 11am, right?
[03:19:06] <Cork> no it starts calculating negatively as the time is passed
[03:19:15] <amcsi_work> hi
[03:19:29] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Shit, how to remedy?
[03:19:29] <Cork> you take a fixed point in time and calculate down to that
[03:19:47] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: in the ticker check if you pass the target; and grab a new date
[03:19:56] <amcsi_work> what's a good pattern to make it so the change event for a radio triggers even if the value hasn't changed from its last value, but the user has selected it by click/keyboard on the radio/label?
[03:19:58] <fRAiLtY-> Needs to countdown to 11am everyday though
[03:20:10] <Cork> might be best to do that in a separate function and call the same code at start
[03:21:09] <fRAiLtY-> Eugh this is a nightmare
[03:21:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it was you writing this; shouldn't you know how it works?
[03:22:32] <Trisox> you got to love grid's
[03:22:34] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  No it's a modified script unfortunately, I thought it would be simple, I feel I'm real close now and then it went wrong grrrr
[03:22:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: not really
[03:22:59] <Cork> you just have to take the part where you generate the ts
[03:23:16] <Cork> move that into a functon that takes a date and fixes it up as a target
[03:23:23] <Cork> call that when the page starts
[03:23:40] <Cork> and then check in the ticker if its passed that date, and fetch a new date if you have
[03:23:44] <Cork> should be a few mins of work
[03:24:29] <Cork> and you shouldn't be using it if you don't feel you know the lib enough to fix that
[03:24:57] <Cork> cause if anything breaks in the future you will be standing there with your pants down
[03:37:21] <litenull> has anyone integrated the jqm with a mvc like backbone ? id like to hear whats the best practice to model an app
[03:38:38] <varnie> good day.
[03:38:46] <geiregjo> litenull,
[03:38:50] <geiregjo> I dead
[03:38:56] <geiregjo> *did
[03:39:13] <geiregjo> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/backbone-require.html
[03:39:22] <litenull> nice
[03:39:26] <litenull> ill check it out
[03:39:28] <litenull> thanx
[03:39:29] <geiregjo> :)
[03:39:30] <geiregjo> yw
[03:39:57] <varnie> what might cause the webpage to reload having the following code: $(document).bind('fooEvent', function() { someFunc(); });
[03:40:06] <varnie> where someFunc performs ajax request
[03:40:11] <varnie> and returns $.Deferred
[03:42:20] <litenull> geiregjo: is there some nice advanced documentation like a book ? do you have any to recommend ?
[03:43:12] <geiregjo> litenull, no sorry
[03:43:33] <litenull> tnx anyw
[03:43:34] <litenull> ay
[03:43:36] <geiregjo> I'm working on a project that combines jqm with backbone. And I figured it all out based on that documentation.
[03:43:37] <litenull> :)
[03:44:06] <is_null> hi all, with jquery ui droppable accept callback: how to get the element that is currently being hovered ?
[03:44:09] <geiregjo> You basically prevent jqm from handling hashchanges and stuff like that and let backbone take care of the routing
[03:44:20] <litenull> i see
[03:44:26] <geiregjo> From then on everything is pure backbone views and models
[03:44:26] <is_null> for some reason, i get the parent element as $(this)
[03:45:02] <litenull> geiregjo: i like the way of books anyway, its clean and semantic. i asked because of that
[03:45:33] <geiregjo> Hmyeah
[03:45:37] <litenull> and because nowadays you have books for everything lol
[03:45:39] <geiregjo> I don't think you'll find one
[03:46:06] <geiregjo> I googled quite a bit when I started the project ...
[03:46:16] <geiregjo> Didn't came across any books
[03:46:22] <geiregjo> so I did my own thinkg
[03:46:32] <geiregjo> with some jqm special router
[03:47:01] <geiregjo> then 2 months later the JQM team added some documentation (the one I linked you) and I updated my project
[03:47:23] <litenull> mhm
[03:47:37] <litenull> well thanks :)
[03:47:38] <geiregjo> But I don't use static HTML, everything is build from html templates
[03:47:47] <litenull> yes thats what i will do
[03:47:54] <geiregjo> Hehe
[03:48:50] <litenull> geiregjo: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh377172.aspx
[03:49:05] <timmillwood> Hi,
[03:49:06] <litenull> those google guys are amazing
[03:49:16] <litenull> how do they do all this :D
[03:49:22] <geiregjo> That's not JQM
[03:49:23] <geiregjo> its JQ
[03:49:24] <geiregjo> :)
[03:49:38] <litenull> no he's using jqm also
[03:49:38] <geiregjo> ow wait
[03:49:43] <geiregjo> yes srr
[03:49:54] <timmillwood> I have a from item in an <li> I would like to duplicate and increment the numbers by one, this is what I have http://pastie.org/private/9feve4ukkpvwg5kxfniedq it works, but seems messy. any ideas of a way to do it better?
[03:50:30] <geiregjo> Can't load the webpage, some JS script is blocking
[03:50:36] <litenull> i see it
[03:50:39] <litenull> oh sorry
[03:50:59] <litenull> nevermind :D
[03:51:02] <geiregjo> :)
[03:51:10] <geiregjo> If you wan't I can work out some example
[03:51:40] <litenull> geiregjo: actually i have to work, but i appreciate your help :)
[03:52:05] <geiregjo> Allright, poke me if you want my input on something
[03:52:14] <litenull> thanks :)
[03:52:18] <litenull> i will
[03:53:46] <litenull> i still dont understand how these guys (paul irish, addy osmani) have time to do all these tutorials, are they aliens ?
[03:58:52] <dismist> i am having an issue with a "speed test" function I have created.... when I run it in async, it doesnt perform the next ping unti lthe previous one finishes... however it locks up the browser completely until the loop is done.  but when i run it regularly, it sends all the requests at the same time.  how can i get the async effect without locking the browser?
[03:59:02] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Can you assist at all?
[04:00:10] <litenull> dismist: setTimeout(function, 0) ?
[04:02:37] <varnie> is the following code correct? "$(document).bind('fooEvent', function() { doAJAX(); });"  //?
[04:06:37] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've done a bit more debugging, it only "doesn't work" between 11am and 12, now 12 has passed it's calculating correctly again?
[04:06:44] <fRAiLtY-> Is that expected?
[04:07:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: is this with or without a restart?
[04:07:54] <Cork> s/restart/reload/
[04:08:16] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I refreshed the fiddle before I started but did some console.logs to see what was what and noticed it was correct… ?
[04:08:32] <fRAiLtY-> I also have this live on a page elsewhere, unedited, which now works, so it's not something changed in the fiddle?
[04:08:59] <Cork> sounds like the "passed check doens't work
[04:09:12] <Cork> ah, ofcourse
[04:10:32] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ts.setHours(11 + (ts.getHours() >= 11 ? 24 : 0));
[04:10:38] <Cork> ^^'
[04:10:52] <Cork> the simplicity of that fix i a bit silly :)
[04:11:15] <Cork> (one char change)
[04:12:03] <fRAiLtY-> Victory!
[04:12:25] <litenull> :)
[04:13:47] <vnl> hi people
[04:13:48] <vnl> http://neverbland.com/
[04:13:55] <vnl> is that a jquery plugin
[04:14:00] <vnl> the page scrolling
[04:14:08] <vnl> any idea how it is done?
[04:14:14] <litenull> nice website
[04:14:43] <vnl> I know litenull
[04:14:58] <vnl> just wondering how to come up with scrolling like that
[04:15:20] <Cork> vnl: yes
[04:15:38] <Cork> http://neverbland.com/js/neverbland.min.js
[04:15:45] <litenull> the script is minified
[04:15:58] <litenull> so.. dunno
[04:15:58] <Cork> no not minified
[04:16:03] <Cork> its onfuscated
[04:16:14] <Cork> but you can still find its references to jquery
[04:16:26] <vnl> I saw jquery in it..
[04:16:47] <Cork> })(jQuery); good prof that it is ya
[04:16:47] <vnl> as I am just beginning web design...still a huge nove at it
[04:17:10] <vnl> novice*
[04:19:36] * Cork hates ppl that obfuscates code...
[04:19:58] <vnl> I can imagine
[04:20:12] <dismist> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3384983/how-can-i-keep-the-browser-from-locking-up-or-show-wait-symbol-when-making-a-s   <--- i am trying to essentially ping the server 20 times.  the only way i can make the pings go sequentially is to use async jquery.  however it locks up the browser... i'd like to somehow implement the code above (if you scroll down towards middle of page) so that it
[04:20:12] <dismist> loops 20 times.  how would i go about doing this?
[04:20:19] <Cork> its not that it prevents you from getting the code
[04:20:24] <dismist> im still trying to understand how callbacks work fully
[04:20:29] <Cork> it just means you will have to jump through some extra hoops for it
[04:20:35] <Cork> and that annoys me
[04:21:12] <Cork> dismist: solution; don't make syncronus ajax calls
[04:21:26] <Cork> you should NEVER do syncronus ajax calls
[04:21:37] <vnl> Cork: So the scrolling can be recreated like in the website
[04:21:58] <Cork> vnl: sure
[04:22:14] <Cork> documentation on how you use the plugin might be a bit hard to find though
[04:23:11] <vnl> Yes, I can just copy the codes but that would not like
[04:23:20] <vnl> I would not like I mean
[04:23:28] <Cork> vnl: it looks like that files includes the plugin and site specific code
[04:23:54] <Cork> so you would prob have to deobfuscate it grab the part you want and use that
[04:24:12] <vnl> Thank you cork for the suggestion
[04:24:18] <vnl> I think I saw a firefox addon
[04:25:25] <vnl> Cork: Do you advice using a IDE for building jquery websites
[04:25:31] <vnl> or a text editor is best
[04:28:33] <Cork> vnl: up to you; i never have, and prob never will
[04:29:46] <brantje> NOtepad++ ftw :D
[04:29:52] <vnl> okay...I think I will do this a bit easier...
[04:30:12] <dismist> im trying to avoid doing synchronous calls but what i want is to make sequential ajax calls.... i want to loop the request 20 times but only start the next one once the previous one finishes
[04:30:12] <Cork> brantje: any real developer use vim ;P
[04:30:18] <brantje> whahaha :p
[04:30:24] <Cork> j/k
[04:30:28] * brantje isn't on linux
[04:30:36] <brantje> altrough i know vim ;p
[04:30:57] <Cork> discorpia: so put the calls in an array
[04:31:11] <Cork> make the next call when you get a success callback from the earlier one
[04:31:26] <Cork> there is no need to lock the process for that
[04:32:52] <anew> anyone can help with an xpath query in here ?
[04:33:46] <Cork> anew: it is way off topic
[04:34:06] <anew> really someone just told me to come in here for xpath lol
[04:34:15] <litenull> vnl: i found the part that triggers the scroll
[04:34:15] <Cork> have you tried asking in #xpath?
[04:34:24] <anew> will check there, thanks cork
[04:34:26] <vnl> woah awesome
[04:34:33] <litenull> let me paste it somewhere
[04:34:39] <vnl> litenull: Thank you
[04:34:50] <dismist> cork: im confused on how i do it 20 times though on the success call
[04:34:53] <litenull> its just a part but it will get you the idea
[04:34:55] <otherj> anyone have an idea why this would make mobile safari lock up when i hit submit? https://gist.github.com/b86e121ac6e68715fa66
[04:35:36] <Cork> otherj: your submit event handler triggers it self
[04:35:37] <anew> is mechaniZe offtopic here also ?
[04:35:37] <vnl> Well true, somewhere to start atleast
[04:35:39] <anew> cork ?
[04:35:44] <Cork> so you end up in an eternal loop
[04:36:11] <Cork> anew: if it a jquery plugin?
[04:36:17] <anew> no nevermind
[04:36:24] <anew> this guy i'm talking to over here is retarded
[04:36:30] <otherj> LOL
[04:36:36] <otherj> takes a second pair of eyes, i guess. thanks Cork
[04:36:45] <otherj> i changed it from .click to .submit and forgot that was there :P
[04:36:59] <Cork> otherj: btw DON'T use return false;
[04:37:14] <Cork> take event as the first argument to the callback
[04:37:18] <Cork> and do even.preventDefault()
[04:38:05] <Kingsy> anyone in here use cloud zoom ?
[04:40:04] <otherj> https://gist.github.com/b86e121ac6e68715fa66
[04:40:05] <otherj> like that?
[04:47:28] <fRAiLtY-> When I click the little image, how can I make it replace the large image? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing/
[04:48:44] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do the large and small image have similar urls?
[04:49:10] <fRAiLtY-> Up until a point
[04:49:10] <Cork> if not; add a data-large="url" on the small image
[04:49:32] <Cork> bind a delegated click event that sets the data-large as src on the big image
[04:49:39] <noregret> does anyone use https://github.com/infusion/jQuery-paging ? i'm facing a bug and wondering if it's teh same
[04:50:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: if its very similar up till ex. a -large or something in the file name that could be done without sending duplicate data
[04:51:10] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Hmm no the first situation, so the thumbnails need data-large adding to the <img> tag?
[04:51:40] <Cork> that's how i would do it yes
[04:52:43] <Cork> preferably a class that identifys it as beeing a thumb or something too
[04:53:21] <Cork> and then $('.more-views').on('click', 'img.thumb', function() { $('#big-picture').attr('src', $(this).data('large')); });
[04:53:50] <Cork> but i guess $('.more-views').on('click', 'img', function() { $('#big-picture').attr('src', $(this).data('large')); }); would work too
[05:01:56] <Beam> is it just me or is animation broken in 1.9 ?
[05:11:49] <DaFyre> Hey All!
[05:12:25] <Kambfhase> ?hi@ DaFyre
[05:12:27] <bot-t> DaFyre, #13009 (Hi ticker error)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 8 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13009
[05:13:36] <DaFyre> Has anyone had any recent reports of show() doing odd things in Chrome?
[05:14:46] <systemfault> Why would it do that? .show() does nothing special.
[05:15:00] <DaFyre> Ha ha ha.  Agreed.
[05:15:35] <litenull> if you see unicorns, prolly time to go take a coffe :D
[05:15:52] <DaFyre> However, when I have a particular div that starts out as hidden, and I do the $('#divName').show() -- the divName will not show until I try to resize the browser window.
[05:16:11] <litenull> which chrome are you using
[05:16:14] <DaFyre> Just woke up a little while ago (got big jar of coffee read already.
[05:16:24] <DaFyre> Windows 24.1312.57
[05:16:30] <philhutchinson> when binding on keydown, is there a way I can chain wildcard inputs?
[05:16:43] <litenull> DaFyre: thats strange
[05:16:55] <philhutchinson> ie $("input[name='qty_*']").live('keyDown', function () { });
[05:16:56] <DaFyre> Indeed.
[05:17:11] <DaFyre> Works fine in Firefox  (I haven't tested in Internet Exploder yet).
[05:17:40] <litenull> debug the thing
[05:17:45] <litenull> use timeline
[05:17:53] <litenull> and check the paint methods
[05:18:10] <DaFyre> @litenull, I can't make heads or tales of the Timeline.
[05:18:17] <DaFyre> The JS Console isn't reporting any errors to me.
[05:18:47] <litenull> :)
[05:18:59] <litenull> click 'record' do the show
[05:19:04] <litenull> and then stop the record
[05:19:09] <litenull> and check what is going on
[05:19:13] <DaFyre> Yea, I got that far yesterday.
[05:19:31] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Wahey! Works! One thing though, I have a zoom which zooms the "previous" image even though it's replaced? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing/
[05:19:49] <DaFyre> After I have the data, I am not sure at all what I am looking at, lol.
[05:19:51] <litenull> DaFyre: id dig further but i dont have much time
[05:20:23] <DaFyre> Is all good.  Thanks for pointing me in the timeline direction.  I will see what I can dig up.
[05:20:25] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ah, hmm, do you start it on the img tag?
[05:20:27] <litenull> maybe theres some strange recalculation going on, do you have any other event handlers binded ?
[05:20:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: if so you might want to replace the img tag instead
[05:20:45] <Cork> and call the plugin again
[05:20:47] <Kambfhase> philhutchinson: You might want to approach that differently.
[05:20:49] <DaFyre> But I can see where it is actually firing the events when I click on stuff.
[05:21:27] <litenull> yes
[05:21:29] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I think so, it fires like so: jQuery('.product-view .product-img-box .product-image-zoom img').addpowerzoom({
[05:21:30] <fRAiLtY->         magnifiersize:[200, 200]
[05:21:31] <fRAiLtY->     });
[05:21:58] * Cork nods
[05:22:02] <litenull> DaFyre: gotta go.
[05:22:05] <litenull> brb
[05:22:10] <Cork> so replace the img tag instead of changing its src
[05:22:18] <Cork> then call the plugin again
[05:22:20] <DaFyre> And I see where it recalculates the style after I click the link that should show it.
[05:22:23] <DaFyre> Thanks for the input!
[05:22:27] <DaFyre> See yas @litenull.
[05:23:35] <philhutchinson> Kambfhase: why?
[05:23:47] <Kambfhase> philhutchinson: $("input").live("keydown", function(){ if( /^qty_/.test( $(this).attr("name")){ …  }})
[05:24:03] <philhutchinson> As opposed to: $("input[name^=qty_]") ??
[05:25:34] <Kambfhase> If you want to do more complex tasks than just checking the beginning of a string, use my method
[05:26:28] <mwic> Hey guys, I'm pasting one of the collapsible-set divs from http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html , but it doesn't function. I have jquery-latest and jquery.mobile linked. What else is required ?
[05:27:16] <mwic> There's no error in the console; I assume I need a container div with the right selector on it or something?
[05:27:27] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Am I right in thinking I'll have to do something like $(this).html('<img src.....);
[05:27:38] <fRAiLtY-> instead of attr
[05:27:51] <Cork> $(this).replaceWith()
[05:27:58] <Cork> if this is the img tag
[05:30:42] <MrThanatos> Hi. Does anybody know why a custom theme wont download? It starts to download, and then just sticks.
[05:31:12] <raygerrard> anyone know any free tools to convert an flv for mediaelements?
[05:31:48] <mwic> raygerrard, ffmpeg?
[05:32:32] <raygerrard> thanks mwic
[05:35:32] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Tried it and not sure I've got it right, here's my snippet. You see the image tag above the JS I tried copying/pasting the <img tag within the replaceWith() function and it didn't' work that well :x http://pastie.org/5986027
[05:38:01] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: var newImg = $('<img/>').attr({ src: $(this).data('large') });  $('#image').replaceWith(newImg); newImg.addpowerzoom();
[05:38:09] <Cork> ioos
[05:38:15] <Cork> *opps
[05:38:33] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: var newImg = $('<img/>').attr({ id: 'image',  src: $(this).data('large') });  $('#image').replaceWith(newImg); newImg.addpowerzoom();
[05:38:35] <Cork> there
[05:38:46] <ShishKabab> Is there any way I can see the event handlers attached with .on() ? I'm unit testing my JS with Selenium and only in my unit tests a certain event handler does not get called.
[05:38:54] <Afflicto> Hey all. I created a .slider() and it starts at 1 and goes down as I move it to the right. It's the wrong direction. Why?
[05:39:39] <Cork> ShishKabab: you can get a list of the events jquery knows about; but it is internal stuff so it changes almost every version
[05:40:09] <Cork> the dom doesn't provide a way to query event listeners, so you can't ever get all
[05:40:38] <ShishKabab> Cork: Is it documented so I can use it for debugging? Of course I won't use it in production.
[05:40:40] <Cork> ?p @ Afflicto
[05:40:41] <bot-t> Afflicto, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:40:54] <Cork> ShishKabab: no, like i said its internal stuff
[05:41:06] <Cork> $._data('events', elm)
[05:41:26] <Cork> and elm is the dom element; not a jquery selector
[05:41:47] <ShishKabab> Cork: Just what I wanted to ask :) Thanks!
[05:42:06] <Cork> ShishKabab: and i'm not guaranteeing that works in 1.9
[05:42:09] <Cork> haven't tested that yet
[05:42:22] <Cork> so the base line is; you can't count on it
[05:42:30] <Cork> but for debugging its enough
[05:42:56] <ShishKabab> Cork: I'm still using 1.7 :$. Yeah, I understand.
[05:43:23] <Cork> ShishKabab: one of my biggest sites is still on 1.4.x
[05:43:25] <Cork> :)
[05:43:31] <mattyh88> hey, this https://gist.github.com/4682942 is Tablesorter's shortDate parser. I'd like to use the dateFormat "ddmmyyyy". But it's not working with error Invalid date at the "new Date(s)" bit
[05:43:38] <Cork> couldn't get past 1.5 cause everything broke
[05:44:06] <mattyh88> (I added the 3rd else if clause btw in that parser)
[05:44:18] <ShishKabab> Cork: Yeah, that's real life :)
[05:45:05] <Cork> mattyh88: what does s look like after the parsing?
[05:45:22] <mattyh88> Cork: ddmmyyyy
[05:45:33] <Cork> date can't understand that
[05:45:57] <mattyh88> Cork: eh sorry 04/11/2011
[05:46:34] <mattyh88> but 04 is day not month
[05:46:55] <Cork> mattyh88: you mean like it should be :)
[05:46:56] <mattyh88> i've got ones like 31/01/2013 too for example
[05:47:19] <mattyh88> new Date(31/01/2013) is giving me an Invalid date error
[05:47:39] <Cork> ya, as the Date expects the first value to be month in that format
[05:48:09] <Cork> i suggest parsing it to the iso standard instead
[05:48:13] <Cork> js> new Date('2011-11-04')
[05:48:16] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:48:24] <Cork> js> print(new Date('2011-11-04'));
[05:48:26] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[05:48:30] <Cork> O_o
[05:48:34] <Cork> hmm
[05:48:41] <Cork> that's weird
[05:48:45] * Cork starts another browser
[05:49:14] <Cork> ...
[05:49:37] <Cork> that works in both chrome and firefox for me...
[05:49:50] <systemfault> Perhaps it's locale related :/
[05:49:51] <Cork> mattyh88: do you also get an error with new Date('2011-11-04') ?
[05:49:53] <systemfault> js> print(new Date('04-11-2011'));
[05:49:58] <b-ot> systemfault: Invalid Date
[05:50:07] <mattyh88> Cork: ah got it now :) with 2011-11-04 :)
[05:50:13] <Cork> js> print(new Date('11/04/2011'));
[05:50:15] <b-ot> Cork: Fri Nov 04 2011 00:00:00 GMT+0000
[05:50:24] <Cork> stupid bot
[05:50:45] <mattyh88> :P
[05:50:56] <Cork> expects the date to be the only broken format >_<
[05:51:23] <Cork> well its not completely broken
[05:51:33] <Cork> 11/04/11 is even worse
[05:52:25] <Cork> js> print(new Date('2011-11-04T00:00:00'));
[05:52:28] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[05:52:31] <Cork> LOL
[05:52:40] <jrajav___> Why are you parsing arbitrarily formatted strings into Date objects, anyway?
[05:53:03] <jrajav___> And if you need to, then why are you not using datejs?
[05:53:05] <Cork> jrajav: its not arbitarary strings
[05:53:12] * jrajav___ eyes jrajav
[05:53:23] <Cork> the last one is a full iso 8601 date string
[05:53:33] <Cork> its the STANDARD for date strings...
[05:53:50] <Cork> but the bots date parser only accepts us date format
[05:53:53] <jrajav> If you try that in a console I'm sure you'll find that it works
[05:54:03] <jrajav> I don't know why it doesn't work on the bot
[05:54:07] <Cork> ya, and that was the point
[05:54:09] <jrajav> >> new Date('2011-11-04T00:00:00')
[05:54:16] <Cork> wrong channel
[05:54:26] <Cork> thats for ##javascript
[05:54:27] <litenull> :)
[05:54:40] <Cork> ?eval new Date('2011-11-04T00:00:00')
[05:54:44] <bot-t> Cork: <2011-11-03T18:30:00.000Z>
[05:54:50] <jrajav> js> Date
[05:54:53] <b-ot> jrajav: No output.
[05:54:53] <Cork> hmm so that bog can handle it
[05:54:59] <Cork> *bot
[05:55:22] <Cork> jrajav: b-t only outputs what you put into print();
[05:55:42] <jrajav> js> (new Date()).__proto__
[05:55:44] <b-ot> jrajav: No output.
[05:55:55] <Cork> js> print(new Date()).__proto__)
[05:55:57] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:56:02] <Cork> lol
[05:56:08] <Cork> opps
[05:56:12] <Cork> js> print((new Date()).__proto__)
[05:56:15] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[05:56:45] <litenull> haha :)
[05:57:00] <Cork> bot-t: slap b-t
[05:57:00] * bot-t slaps b-t around a bit with a large trout
[06:21:08] <tomasm-> is there an easy way to find out the closest ancestor of an object that has scrollbars enabled? ie scrollHeight > clientHeight . I'm trying to implement a hashchange to jump to an object, but the scrollbars arent on the window, so it wont work by default. the object with the scrollbars could vary. wasnt sure if there was a generic way to check for scrollable ancestors
[06:23:40] <gnarf> tomasm-: you could loop over .parents() with a filter
[06:24:32] <tomasm-> actually i'm realizing now that i'd probably have a class set on the container, so there's really only two to check
[06:24:54] <gnarf> tomasm-: if you're using jquery ui core, you have .fn.scrollParent: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L70-L83
[06:25:03] <gnarf> tomasm-: if not, you can always steal it :)
[06:25:42] <tomasm-> w00t!
[06:25:47] <tomasm-> that works even better than my hackjob
[06:28:50] <tomasm-> hmmm, i wonder if there's a way to do a scrollTop() based on a delta, rather than an absolute number, ie -200 back from current position
[06:29:37] <jrajav> If only there were some way to do basic arithmetic on values that you retrieve in programs
[06:29:42] <gnarf> tomasm-: .animate({ scrollTop: "-=200px" }, { duration: 0 });
[06:29:58] <tomasm-> hmm
[06:30:21] <litenull> nice
[06:30:27] <gnarf> sure
[06:30:32] <gnarf> its a lot of extra work
[06:30:35] <tomasm-> whats with the '=' sign?
[06:30:45] <tomasm-> ie why not -200px
[06:30:58] <jrajav> That would be ambiguous with the actual position -200px
[06:30:58] <gnarf> .css( "scrollTop", function( index, value ) { return parseFloat( value ) - 200; });
[06:31:14] <gnarf> what jrajav said
[06:31:15] <jrajav> Read it more as "assign the current scroll position to this"
[06:31:24] <litenull> yep
[06:32:02] <ShishKabab> I've traced down a quite vague error to a mysterious problem using jQuery 1.7. I have a script with the standard (function($){  })(jQuery); pattern. In that script, I attach an event handler to an element with $(selector).on() and later check with $field.data("events") or $(selector).data("events") I see the event handler. If I do jQuery(selector).data("events") immediately after that, I see no event handlers. How is that possible?
[06:32:09] <tomasm-> but that shorthand animate() version works too?
[06:32:26] <sweb> is jquery ui officialy support `rtl` right to left page layout ?
[06:32:59] <gnarf> sweb: we don't do any testing with rtl
[06:33:14] <gnarf> tomasm-: the animate() does a lot more work than is needed to do that tho, but yes, it works
[06:33:21] <sweb> gnarf: why ? why dont think i18n ?
[06:33:37] <sweb> until 1.9 0.o
[06:33:48] <gnarf> sweb: because we haven't had reports of things failing so we haven't written any specific test cases for it
[06:34:02] <gnarf> I mean, I assume everything we do is agnostic of the text direction
[06:35:50] <kostodo> Im trying to use height() and width() to get the specs of an <img>
[06:36:04] <gnarf> kostodo: gotta wait for the image to actually load before you can read those
[06:36:07] <kostodo> Which is sitting inside a div which has overflow: hidden
[06:36:09] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[06:36:09] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[06:36:19] <kostodo> yeah exactly thats what I'm struggling with
[06:36:22] <kostodo> thought it was overflow hidden
[06:36:40] <kostodo> is there no other way to do that?
[06:36:53] <gnarf> you have to wait for the image to load
[06:36:56] <gnarf> thats the safest way
[06:36:59] <rmill> img.load
[06:37:09] <gnarf> considering some browsers are unreliable about the load event on cached images
[06:37:13] <gnarf> i suggest that mini-plugin
[06:37:21] <rmill> YEH
[06:37:26] <gnarf> but you could just use .on( "load", ... ) yourself too
[06:38:20] <tomasm-> thanks all
[06:39:02] <kostodo> thanks guys
[06:41:05] <sweb> gnarf: it's not just about text direction. think about non georgian calendar type.
[06:42:09] <gnarf> sweb: i'm pretty sure our datepicker only works on georgian, but thats just a failing of its design... It hasn't hit the rewrite phase yet (all the ui widgets are being refactored over the last and next few releases)
[06:49:46] <noregret> does anyone use https://github.com/infusion/jQuery-paging ? i'm facing a bug and wondering if it's teh same
[07:13:45] <Beam> is there any easy way to make events that affect anywhere *except* on a list of selectors?
[07:17:36] <computer2000> what is the recommended way to offer a flash fallback player for html5 videos? im looking for a slim and lightweight flash player... recommendations?
[07:22:14] <katsh> Does anyone know if there's a browser plugin that lets me see if an element has jquery binded to it/
[07:22:17] <bil`_> Beam: WHy don;t you just make your event Handler check against the list and do nothing in that case
[07:22:39] <katsh> so id hover over an a tag anf it would show me if theres jquery that handles that a's click or hover, etc
[07:23:08] <raboof> katsh: there's a firebug plugin - not sure if it's EventBug or Firefinder (I have them both installed)
[07:23:19] <katsh> ill install both. thanks raboof
[07:23:20] <raboof> oh, or FireQuery :)
[07:23:24] <johnkpaul> Beam: you can delegate from the body, or some other ancestor
[07:23:38] <johnkpaul> and then check if it is :not() what you want to exclude
[07:23:42] <johnkpaul> ?delegate @ Beam
[07:23:42] <b-ot> Beam: Older/Non-recommended way to do event delegation with jQuery. For new projects, use the second form of .on, .on(event, selector, handler) instead.
[07:23:44] <bot-t> Beam, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:24:30] <johnkpaul> Beam: oops, use .on() using the delegating signature
[07:24:31] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  You around?
[07:24:49] <Cork> sure
[07:31:41] <fRAiLtY-> Img all works fine (thank you) trying to swap the product label (or alt tag) now too http://pastie.org/5987920
[07:32:20] <fRAiLtY-> So when the img swaps it swaps the alt tag  also
[07:32:30] <fRAiLtY-> as well as the img tag which works well
[07:33:14] <litenull> nice :)
[07:33:32] <litenull> didnt know about replaceWith
[07:33:52] <fRAiLtY-> Me neither :D
[07:38:40] <fRAiLtY-> Cork ^^
[07:39:34] <Cork> ok
[07:39:47] <lil-murph> If i have a differed object, def and i do def.done(..).fail(..), then use $.when(def).then(...), will the when always run after the done/fail handlers?
[07:40:12] <Cork> replaceWith basically inserts the new element before the old, and removes the old element
[07:41:39] <fRAiLtY-> Right, well I have a div ('#product-label-text') which contains the alt tag
[07:41:45] <fRAiLtY-> It's this I'm trying to update on the onclick
[07:43:43] <Cork> alt isnt a tag
[07:43:56] <Cork> and is product-label-text an image?
[07:44:33] <computer2000> offtopic, can anyone recommend an small and light flash player for use as html5 video fallback?
[07:49:56] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: #product-label-text is a div with text in
[07:50:07] <fRAiLtY-> I want to change that text, on click, with the alt tag of the newly loaded img
[07:50:21] <Cork> what does alt have to do with it then?
[07:50:56] <Cork> or are you looking for title?
[07:51:49] <fRAiLtY-> When I click the thumbnail, it replaces the main image with the thumbnail right?
[07:51:50] <pusewicz__> Hi
[07:51:56] <Cork> sure
[07:52:04] <fRAiLtY-> I also have a div hovering the image echo'ing the alt tag
[07:52:11] <fRAiLtY-> So when I change the image, I  need the alt tag to swap also
[07:52:28] <Cork> alt tag??
[07:52:31] <Cork> you lose me there
[07:52:41] <pusewicz__> guys
[07:52:42] <Cork> there is no alt tag
[07:52:59] <pusewicz__> I have a table, and I listen to a click event on a table row to expand it
[07:53:07] <pusewicz__> but also, in one of the rows I do have a simple link
[07:53:20] <pusewicz__> how can I make it so that clicking that link won't trigger the tr click?
[07:53:20] <lil-murph> Cork: he obviously means the alt attribute.
[07:53:44] <Cork> lil-murph: on a div; that still doesn't make sense
[07:53:54] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Sorry I'm not being very clear
[07:54:13] <fRAiLtY-> Those images have "labels" or "alt" attributes, i.e. <img src="gsgsdfsdf" alt="SFDSFSF" />
[07:54:21] <lil-murph> Cork: he swaps the image (by changing it's src i assume) and wants to change it's "alt" attribute (on the img tag) as well
[07:54:22] <fRAiLtY-> So when you click on the image it swaps it out in the main
[07:54:28] <fRAiLtY-> lil-murph:  is right
[07:54:47] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes alt is for alternative test, its not a label
[07:54:53] <Cork> its a fallback if the image is missing
[07:55:16] <Cork> title give you tooltips
[07:55:56] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: is what lil-murph says what your looking for?
[07:56:25] <fRAiLtY-> Yes essentially, because I can then append this to the div, right?
[07:56:33] <Cork> yes
[07:56:53] <Cork> but i guess you want to replace rather then append
[07:57:11] <Cork> just $(target).html($(this).attr('alt'))
[08:00:30] <fRAiLtY-> Thanks Cork, sorry for the confusion
[08:00:40] <Cork> np
[08:00:45] <blk_panther> hello everyone - the .load() function with one parameter is asynchonous?
[08:03:10] <Cork> blk_panther, everything ajax based is async by default in jquery
[08:03:40] <Cork> you have a callback that is called when .load is done
[08:03:44] <blk_panther> if I .load() a resource that is ~300kb firefox (18.0.1) freezes for 2 minutes; firebug says it's loaded in a few seconds, still firefox and firebug freeze
[08:04:22] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: perhaps you've misidentified your issue
[08:04:23] <Cork> might be while it processes the string
[08:05:20] <blk_panther> perhaps, I tried to split the file in 7 to load lesser chunks, still same problem - feel free to take a look http://blk-panther.de/fw/test/talentcalculator2.html
[08:05:55] <^Lestat> Im having a template issue Im trying to work out here... http://pastebin.com/H5AzzwZ1 my console gives me Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined (anonymous function)
[08:06:09] <lundy> hi folks, quick question...... for some reason in my work when play the radio it plays for so long then it cuts out. How can I add a script into the background which checks for internet connection or if a website is running. and then refresh page
[08:06:12] <lundy> if its down
[08:06:25] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... what is a "jQuery ecosystem"?
[08:06:53] <^Lestat> ..there is only one line of jq for a datepicker
[08:07:03] <blk_panther> what processing does .load() do? all I want it to do is: put html (I want to postload) in a div (so the initial dl of the website is faster)
[08:07:22] <Cork> blk_panther: sidenote, your selectors for the load finders is way over complicated
[08:07:23] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: what kind of content?
[08:08:03] <Cork> '#hiddenPreload>#tooltips>#Krieger' could just be '#Krieger' the rest is overkill and will only slow down the selector
[08:08:11] <blk_panther> Cork: yes - "production" won't have it that way (ty nontheless)
[08:08:16] <^Lestat> do I need to load jq in the head of my doc?
[08:08:37] <Cork> ^Lestat: if you want to us dom ready yes
[08:10:10] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: for the "tooltips" (cluetip) of the other "tabs" of my "aplication" - it's basically lot's of <div> with text in it
[08:10:31] <^Lestat> tadaaaaaa
[08:10:45] <^Lestat> for some reason I was thnking it 'should be' in the footer
[08:11:02] <lundy> anyone able to shed some light on my problem?
[08:11:26] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: tbh, i'd skip the extra XHR call.  since they're static (i presume), i'd load those tooltips into a JS object (instead of DOM elements) and then render the DOM elements when you need, with the info from the object).   Just an alternative to making a network request for info that's always the same.
[08:11:55] <^Lestat> aye how-jquery-works/
[08:12:05] <^Lestat> oh man I love the redesign. (Its been a while for me)
[08:12:54] <computer2000> offtopic, can anyone recommend an small and light flash player for use as html5 video fallback?
[08:13:26] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: I don't know what's tbh means, I don't know what an XHR call is and how do I load them into an JS obj.? (and yes, thay're static)
[08:13:43] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: tbh = to be honest.  XHR call is AJAX.
[08:14:01] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: your backend would write the JS object.
[08:14:10] <blk_panther> okay
[08:14:31] <blk_panther> any info on that method where I can read and understand it?
[08:15:47] <blk_panther> what I could do (ofc.) is put that 300kb div in my site and it loads slow like hell - but works
[08:16:07] <^Lestat> Cork: Thanks man ;-)
[08:16:14] <Cork> np
[08:16:16] <blk_panther> but I try not to - every solution will work for me
[08:16:49] <Cork> blk_panther: most of the time its more costly to do extra network calls then it is to send the data
[08:17:39] <scar> is there a jquery function to grab a random integer between 1 and 9? lol
[08:18:28] <blk_panther> the load time increases drastically - I thought if I load it after the site finished loading, it's in the background and (even if it's a call more with http overhead) it will not influence the user
[08:18:57] <Cork> scar: scar isn't Math.random() good enough for you? :D
[08:19:22] <blk_panther> sca
[08:19:27] <blk_panther> scar: Math.random()
[08:19:32] <Cork> ?eval Math.round(Math.random() * 10)
[08:19:35] <bot-t> Cork: 2
[08:20:17] <Cork> oh wait you said 9 not 10
[08:20:21] <Cork> ?eval Math.round(Math.random() * 9)
[08:20:22] <bot-t> Cork: 8
[08:20:51] <Cork> aaand thats 0 to 9
[08:20:57] <Cork> ?eval Math.round(Math.random() * 8) + 1
[08:20:58] <bot-t> Cork: 8
[08:21:43] <scar> hm
[08:22:00] <Cork> opps round can go the wrong way
[08:22:07] <Brodingo> ?eval Math.floor(Math.random() * (9 - 1 + 1)) + 1
[08:22:07] <bot-t> Brodingo: 8
[08:22:09] <Cork> ?eval Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) + 1
[08:22:10] <bot-t> Cork: 7
[08:22:14] <Brodingo> ?eval Math.floor(Math.random() * (9 - 1 + 1)) + 1
[08:22:14] <blk_panther> .ceil? :)
[08:22:14] <bot-t> Brodingo: 2
[08:22:50] <Cork> (9 - 1 + 1) ??
[08:22:54] <Brodingo> heh
[08:22:59] <Brodingo> was just copying from SO
[08:23:02] <Cork> that's... meaning full :)
[08:23:04] <Brodingo> didn't really look
[08:23:05] <scar> lol
[08:23:11] <scar> ?eval Math.round(Math.random() * 9)
[08:23:12] <bot-t> scar: 6
[08:23:14] <scar> ?eval Math.round(Math.random() * 9)
[08:23:18] <scar> hm
[08:23:27] <codepython7771> I need a tool that will move all my JS to minified JS , same for CSS in a production environment. What could I use?
[08:23:29] <Brodingo> use floor and +1
[08:23:30] <Cork> that will be 0 to 10 though
[08:23:35] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: any more infos for js obj. and/or my problem?
[08:23:39] <Cork> you want Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) + 1
[08:23:47] <scar> hm
[08:24:02] <Cork> rand give you a decimal number between 0 and 1
[08:24:04] <scar> interesting. crazy how all the examples online i saw wer wrong lol
[08:24:21] <lundy> ?eval Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) + 1
[08:24:21] <bot-t> lundy: 4
[08:24:25] <Cork> the number you multiply with gives the highest number
[08:24:28] <blk_panther> codepython7771: bash scripting?
[08:24:34] <lundy> ?eval Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) + 1
[08:24:34] <bot-t> lundy: 8
[08:24:36] <Cork> and then you add to push up the lowest
[08:24:56] <lundy> hi folks, quick question...... for some reason in my work when play the radio it plays for so long then it cuts out. How can I add a script into the background which checks for internet connection or if a website is running. and then refresh page
[08:25:22] <Cork> and then you floor that to remove the decimals
[08:25:32] <codepython7771> blk_panther: CSS/JS/html minification for production - is that how you do it?
[08:25:44] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: you can do XHR if you want, or you can load all the tooltips into a <script> element in the page and query that when you render your toolips.
[08:26:27] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: ho'd I load them into <script>?
[08:26:31] <blk_panther> *w
[08:26:38] <lundy> would it be ok to run XHR or longpoll to make sure a website is up / internet is running ok ........ and if it goes down then refresh a page?
[08:27:01] <Cork> blk_panther: better option is to have the server send json
[08:27:11] <Cork> and you just pull in that and store that in a variable
[08:27:16] <codepython7771> blk_panther: whats the recommended way for minification?
[08:27:40] <Cork> $.getJSON(url. function(json) { window.tooltips = json; })
[08:28:50] <blk_panther> Cork: ty - I'll look into that
[08:30:00] <blk_panther> codepython7771: our minifying scripts developed over time and are called on build from svn (depends on switch) - I thought you have minifying scripts already - else use google and a system that fits you
[08:31:10] <codepython7771> blk_panther: Do you have a pointer for me for a minifying script?
[08:32:13] <NoiseEee> codepython7771: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2
[08:33:04] <codepython7771> NoiseEee: does not work on html/css
[08:33:27] <NoiseEee> codepython7771: you can concat your css and serve it as a single file if you choose
[08:35:31] <blk_panther> codepython7771: not using it myself, but I'd say html tidy
[08:41:08] <lundy> hi guys, iv got a localhost page here... is there anyway of grabbing something from my server "http://lundy.me.uk" ?
[08:41:17] <lundy> or do I need to enable something?
[08:42:35] <NoiseEee> http://enable-cors.org/ @ lundy
[08:44:15] <lundy> do i need to install this? or can I edit my htacces?
[08:45:22] <NoiseEee> did you read the link?
[08:46:49] <lundy> iv added header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');   to my PHP page
[08:46:51] <Heath_> Hey, I have jquery mobile and it is adding classes to my body tag, which I don't want. how do I avoid this?
[08:56:01] <tomasm-> what is the recommended way to implement browser history entries (ie back button) in ajax? I have a modal dialog that I have links jump around to different sections, etc and I want the back button to work properly
[08:56:30] <tomasm-> I see the hashchange plugin, but nothing about how to load the previous content when back is pressed
[08:58:45] <Saaether> tomasm- you could do a hashchange bind on window
[08:59:15] <tomasm-> Saaether, but i'm assuming that the 'state' is saved somewhere, either added to the browser history or in some data var
[08:59:58] <tomasm-> my understanding is that hashchange is just for event handling, not loading content
[09:02:05] <Saaether> tomasm- say you start with hash #1 and click a link changing it to #2, you hit the backbutton which changes it back to #1 and in the hashchange event listener you would catch the event and load the data for hash #1
[09:02:45] <tomasm-> Saaether, yes but where is this loading the data from hash #1? do I Need to hand code that?
[09:03:20] <Saaether> its not saving the data or anything from before, you would need to reload that data
[09:03:40] <tomasm-> are you talking about a specific plugin, or in general?
[09:03:46] <Saaether> general
[09:04:08] <Saaether> dont know about that specific plugin
[09:05:10] <jrockjiggz> ?index
[09:05:10] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[09:05:27] <tomasm-> so am I supposed to store the html content of the container in a specific variable (a queue), when it initially loads/fires, so when I press back, it checks the queue and loads that content already saved?
[09:07:58] <Saaether> you could possibly do it that way, or just load the page data based off the hashtag
[09:08:05] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: why is my firefox freezing when I .load() alot of dom elements (after the ajax call was successful)?
[09:08:07] <Saaether> no need to track history that way
[09:08:17] <tomasm-> Saaether, sorry, I dont follow
[09:08:21] <BillCriswell> I hate when something doesnt work, then as soon as I call for some support the thing I just did 12 times works.
[09:09:04] <blk_panther> BillCriswell: are you my dad?
[09:09:17] <BillCriswell> blk_panther: I might be.
[09:09:29] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: how are you creating the DOM elements?  and again: why create them all at once?  why not create them when the tooltip is asking for the content?
[09:10:00] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: 10000 tooltips should not results in 10000 elements.  there should be *one* tooltip element that gets its content changed and location changed according to need
[09:10:04] <chrisbolton> I've got two columns of data and I've got an ajax call to remove one of the items in the columns when I click delete. Is there any way for the table to adjust for the blank space I just created?
[09:10:59] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: I could use seperate ajax calls on every tooltip, but then the tooltip would be delayed
[09:11:17] <tomasm-> Saaether, what do you mean by "just load the page data based off the hashtag"? does that mean I need to store that data somehow beforehand (once the content in the dialog loads)?
[09:11:55] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: thats not what i'm saying!  have the tooltip content ready to be queried based off that initial XHR call.  var allTooltips = $.getJSON;   tooltip.content = allTooltips.someLookupID
[09:13:03] <blk_panther> right, I'll try that - needs to work with the cluetip plugin - I'm on that
[09:13:26] <blk_panther> but my tester say's if he loads my page it's not freezing or anything
[09:13:58] <blk_panther> so I wondered why my firefox freezes for 2 min, while others don't
[09:14:24] <blk_panther> if it's working on every other machine out there - I don't need to change a thing
[09:14:59] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: could be how you're making the DOM elements, could be that he has a much faster computer than yours.
[09:15:57] <blk_panther> okay - another question NoiseEee: won't the garbage-collector of the new fancy js-engines collect(destroy) my variable?
[09:16:17] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: uh, no
[09:16:18] <tomasm-> if I use $(container).load(url) , and I add that url to the window hash, ie http://www.domain.com/iamhere#container_url, am I supposed to save the container.html() somewhere in memory so when hashchange happens (ie someone presses back, assuming to this previous state),  that the container fills with this older state of content?
[09:16:46] <blk_panther> I red that "preloaded" img objects were destroyed by them
[09:17:14] <NoiseEee> blk_panther: not an issue
[09:17:16] <tfitts> blk_panther: you really think they're going to update the engines and have it break all the existing js code written like that?
[09:17:59] <blk_panther>  Ifeared that browserwars could have such undesired results
[09:18:29] <Qbix1> hey guys
[09:18:35] <tfitts> not a very good way to win a browser war by making a bunch of webpages not work anymore in your browser.
[09:18:35] <Qbix1> I have a big suggestion to simplify jQuery
[09:19:05] <Qbix1> right now you have $.extend and other functions call isPlainObject, which does some magic with blacklists, by trying to make sure what an object is NOT
[09:19:09] <blk_panther> :)
[09:19:27] <Qbix1> instead, you can simply have isPlainObject call Object.prototype.toString.apply(obj) === '[Object object]' and poof!
[09:19:32] <Qbix1> it's called the something device, I forgot what
[09:19:36] <Qbix1> anyone remember?
[09:19:39] <Qbix1> guy from google
[09:19:44] <Qbix1> in any case, it would make jQuery code a lot simpler
[09:20:15] <Qbix1> although it needs to be tested whether all browsers do immediate garbage collection on the strings created by toString.apply when it goes out of scope, othewise it might take up too much memory
[09:20:57] <alicefreak> Hi guys, alert() function is not working in bootstrap popover windows. Here is a js fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/4FujN/2/. can anyone help me? thanks
[09:21:06] <alicefreak> Am i missing something?
[09:23:45] <tomasm-> is the $(container).load(url) related at all to $(container).bind('load') ? ie will the event get triggered when i load content in a container?
[09:40:53] <djQuery> alicefreak, I get the alert when clicking on the numbers
[09:42:07] <someprimetime_> lyke dis if u cry evrytim
[09:45:08] <anew> like like like
[09:46:51] <Ziber> I want to get the contents from a remote PHP file into a div. Can I just $("#element").load("url/to/file")?
[09:57:14] <raygerrard> yes
[09:57:25] <Ziber> Doesn't seem to work...
[09:59:25] <Ziber> Console error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://static.x.jkode.us/dropdown.js. Origin http://x.jkode.us is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[10:01:03] <blk_panther> NoiseEee: if my fx don't freeze anymore - can I leave my script as is? or any objections
[10:02:54] <BadCodSmell> IS there a filter that checls each child element too?
[10:03:26] <HarryPitfall> anyone knows why jQuery remove the $.browser in latest versions?
[10:06:00] <BadCodSmell> Better question
[10:06:17] <BadCodSmell> how do I create a custom jquery function to act on a set?
[10:06:27] <BadCodSmell> Or a dom node
[10:06:46] <BadCodSmell> you'll either get domnode or [domenode, domenode,..] right?
[10:10:42] <bambu> When you use $("#this").load("page.html #that");
[10:11:20] <bambu> does it return the entire <div id="that">that</div> or just the content inside #that?
[10:11:46] <BadCodSmell> the whole div
[10:11:49] <BadCodSmell> http://pastebin.com/3cLCDCcJ
[10:11:52] <Saaether> if i recall it doesnt include the div tags though
[10:11:53] <BadCodSmell> how can I get this to work?
[10:12:01] <bambu> That explains quite a bit :)
[10:12:29] <BadCodSmell> The selector the whole div the loader the content of the div
[10:12:52] <bambu> What?
[10:13:12] <BadCodSmell> I would imagine it's .html not .replace
[10:14:19] <BadCodSmell> How do I add more shit to jquery wrapper?
[10:14:25] <bambu> $("#this").load("page.html #that *");  seems to work, but there must be a better way.
[10:14:44] <BadCodSmell> proved a success function
[10:14:47] <BadCodSmell> provide*
[10:14:50] <tomasm-> i'm looking at scrollParent() and it uses some arcane syntax, ie " $.curCSS(this, 'position', 1) " instead of " $(this).css('position')" ... anyone know why? even though there is a scrollable parent, it ALWAYS returns #document, ie the tests dont pass. the $(this).css() syntax works ,though
[10:14:59] <BadCodSmell> unless you tell it exactly what to do, it could do anything
[10:19:09] <zmbmartin> I am trying to pass data from swf to javascript. This is what console.log shows as the returned data -> Object {bytesAvailable: 274476, objectEncoding: 3, endian: "littleEndian", length: 274476, position: 0…}
[10:19:21] <zmbmartin> How do I add that to FormData() so I can send to server?
[10:19:33] <zmbmartin> Add the actual bytes
[10:20:02] <zmbmartin> I am trying to pass sound data from actionscript back to javascript
[10:20:15] <jfisk1987> hey all
[10:21:44] <tomasm-> anyone know what the heck $.curCSS() is? and why it might still be used?
[10:23:21] <tomasm-> or perhaps what $.css(container, 'position',1) differs from $(container).css('position') ?
[10:23:28] <gnarf> tomasm-: its internal, undocumented
[10:23:44] <gnarf> tomasm-: i think its just jQuery.css() now too
[10:23:46] <bambu> http://bambuseae.org/  any tips to smooth out the animations?  http://bambuseae.org/main.js
[10:23:47] <gnarf> but yeah
[10:24:11] <gnarf> jQuery( element ).css( ... ) -> jQuery.css( element, ... )
[10:24:26] <gnarf> for the most part
[10:24:28] <tomasm-> gnarf, ok but what about that odd syntax for $.css(container, 'position', 1) ? ie the 3rd parameter?
[10:24:41] <gnarf> that would be used as a setter
[10:24:44] <gnarf> the 1 doesn't make any sense tho
[10:25:14] <tomasm-> gnarf, its right in that scrollParent() in jquery.ui that I think you suggested earlier
[10:26:11] <gnarf> might be a hold over from a newer version
[10:26:18] <gnarf> and actually i was wrong , css is a getter only
[10:26:20] <gnarf> for that
[10:26:24] <BadCodSmell> ok I got deep filter working
[10:26:58] <gnarf> and i meant hold over from older version
[10:27:08] <gnarf> .style seems to be the getter/setter version
[10:27:14] <gnarf> either way
[10:27:19] <gnarf> both are undocumented internals
[10:27:30] <djQuery> dang I wish I could find a developement ide that support lint as you type and git for ubuntu
[10:27:42] <gnarf> djQuery: sublime text 2
[10:27:58] <gnarf> djQuery: install sublimelinter and git via package control
[10:28:12] <gnarf> and it's cross-platform too
[10:28:35] <djQuery> using aptana right now but don't like its lint support
[10:28:48] <gnarf> sublimelinter will use .jshintrc files too
[10:28:51] <gnarf> i think
[10:28:55] <gnarf> if you set it up right
[10:29:19] <djQuery> does it support autocomplete for jquery?
[10:29:44] <tomasm-> gnarf, ok seems the fixed scrollParent to use $.css(this, "position") in the newer version.... I have 1.8.24
[10:30:27] <tomasm-> ooh, are there any serious changes between jquery 1.8.2 and 1.9 ? ie to watch out for code breaking
[10:30:44] <bambu> The slide effect seems a tad nicer, I'm going to mess around with this a bit.
[10:33:43] <Mottie> gnarf: are you there? can I ask a quick question if you're not in a meeting?
[10:35:08] <gnarf> Mottie: sup
[10:35:11] <BadCodSmell> http://pastebin.com/xkijD28J how do I make this not crash jquery?
[10:35:32] <gnarf> ?g jQuery 1.9 upgrade guide @tomasm-
[10:35:33] <bot-t> tomasm-, jQuery Core 1.9 Upgrade Guide | jQuery - http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[10:35:36] <Mottie> it's about the jquery html string issue... that it must start with a "<"
[10:35:45] <BadCodSmell> oh this[i] is not liked
[10:35:56] <BadCodSmell> still doesn't work though
[10:36:35] <Mottie> gnarf: when I use ajax to grab content, it almost always starts with a tab... so if I want to search the ajax data, I have to do $( $.trim(data) ) everytime now.
[10:37:12] <Mottie> can't the html() function at least $.trim the data before rejecting it?
[10:37:15] <gnarf> Mottie: correct - there is a duck punch for that in jquery-migrate
[10:37:17] <gnarf> and/or
[10:37:21] <gnarf> use $.parseHTML
[10:37:25] <gnarf> ?jQuery.parseHTML
[10:37:29] <bot-t> gnarf, Define a $.parseHTML method for creating HTML fragments - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11617
[10:37:42] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseHTML/ @Mottie
[10:37:51] <djQuery> jsfiddle is now completly busted for me. the javascript window got minimized and I cant get it back open
[10:37:56] <gnarf> $($.parseHTML( data ))
[10:38:10] <Mottie> $.parseHTML doesn't work for me because there are numerous elements inside... so if I do $( $.parseHTML(data) ).find('.selector')... it almost always returns empty
[10:38:34] <gnarf> .filter(".selector") ?
[10:38:49] <Mottie> hmmm
[10:38:50] <Mottie> LOL
[10:38:51] <gnarf> $( data ) should give the same result in 1.8 as $( $.parseHTML(data) ) in 1.9
[10:39:00] <BadCodSmell> ok it turns out jquery is just screwed up and I've exceeded it
[10:39:14] <BadCodSmell> gnarf: Filter does not work that way and jquery has inconsistent behaviour
[10:39:23] <Mottie> good point, I'll use filter. But the $.trim is still kinda annoying
[10:39:36] <gnarf> Mottie: parseHTML is better anyway
[10:39:37] <gnarf> use it
[10:39:40] <gnarf> more explicit
[10:39:41] <gnarf> :)
[10:40:03] <tomasm-> im getting a gateway timeout when trying to download a custom build of jquery ui
[10:40:11] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: you don't know what your talking about, filter is exactly what Mottie wants if the goal is to find top layer elements in an html string parsed
[10:40:48] <gnarf> tomasm-: hrm, retry? the service is running and I got one alright
[10:40:57] <gnarf> tomasm-: and/or send me a link to your download?
[10:40:58] <BadCodSmell> not for me
[10:40:58] <Mottie> gnarf: thanks!

[10:41:21] <tomasm-> OOPS SORRY
[10:41:27] <gnarf> tinyurl that shit? :)
[10:41:41] <ryanneufeld> no kidding
[10:42:00] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: what is the goal of your deepRemove function?
[10:42:04] <tomasm-> didnt know. but http://jqueryui.com/download/ times out also, when i click "DOWNLOAD" at the bottom
[10:42:12] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: I can barely understand what it's trying to do
[10:42:30] <tomasm-> and I see this odd word "Theme" at the bottom, but nothing next to it, ie no theme picker, etc
[10:43:04] <callumacrae> Hoorah, my book has been published! :D
[10:43:24] <gnarf> tomasm-: i just restarted the download builder
[10:43:27] <gnarf> not sure what was broken
[10:43:49] <santamaria> what is the order of events fired in jquery sortable when moving an item from one list to another?
[10:44:23] <bambu> Sometimes when I activate the button too fast, the $on() doesn't catch
[10:44:34] <gnarf> tomasm-: it takes it a bit to rebuild cache when it first starts up
[10:44:40] <gnarf> tomasm-: but i think it should be working soon
[10:44:53] <xec> callumacrae: congratulations sir!
[10:45:23] <callumacrae> Have I talked about it yet in here? I have in every other channel at some point in the last six months xD
[10:45:55] <zmbmartin> Anyone have an idea how I can turn this into post data http://pastie.org/5991918
[10:46:19] <zmbmartin> I am passing back recorder.output from swf to js and this is what I get.
[10:46:20] <bambu> Using event.stopPropagation(); seems to mitigate this. Ignore me :p
[10:46:20] <xec> callumacrae: not that i have seen. link?
[10:46:32] <callumacrae> http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026280.do
[10:47:20] <BadCodSmell> How can I find out what exactly jquery is actually wrapping?
[10:47:56] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: it's an array, you can .get() to get the raw array, or just .each() or for(....) it
[10:48:25] <gnarf> chrome will print the elements in an array if you console.log it
[10:48:27] <BadCodSmell> I can understand why $('<div></div>') might differ from $('<div><div></div></div>') but why $('<div><div></div><div></div></div>') works the same as $('<div></div>') ?
[10:48:45] <BadCodSmell> ops
[10:49:33] <BadCodSmell> $('div', $('<div><div></div><div></div></div>'))
[10:50:18] <tomasm-> gnarf, it downloads now, but what about themes? are all themes included? or do I go elsewhere to get those?
[10:50:54] <xec> BadCodSmell: i would expect that last one to contain a collection of two (empty) divs...
[10:51:01] <gnarf> tomasm-: i think there is a link on the download page to download all of them, or you can build with the one you want, or themeroller it
[10:51:03] <xec> BadCodSmell: what are you getting?
[10:51:53] <tomasm-> gnarf, yeah, the first time i went there, the 'theme' section of the page was totally blank, now it offers a dropdown list of themes.
[10:53:49] <BadCodSmell> xec: its performing subsequent stuff that differs
[10:53:50] <BadCodSmell> $('div', $('> div', $('<div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div>')))
[10:54:38] <BadCodSmell> When it's derived from a search it magically works with find, when I create, it needs filter
[10:54:46] <BadCodSmell> I don't really get the difference.
[10:55:25] <gnarf> tomasm-: yeah, it loads that from download builder which was down(or something)
[10:55:42] <tomasm-> gnarf, thanks!
[10:56:09] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: so $( html ) gives you an array, $( "<div><span></span></div><div><span></span></div>" ) for example here
[10:56:33] <xec> BadCodSmell: find is for searching recursively through descendants (not looking at rool level element(s)) while filter will only look at root level elements
[10:56:45] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: [ <div>​…​</div>​, <div>​…​</div>​ ]
[10:57:09] <gnarf> so stuff.filter( "div" ) will find those, but .find( "div" ) looks at CHILDREN
[10:57:23] <gnarf> if you want to look for BOTH
[10:57:37] <xec> wra-wra-wrap it!
[10:57:47] <gnarf> I would suggest doing $( "<div>" + html + "</div>" ).find( ... )
[10:57:50] * xec makes scratching sounds
[10:58:02] <gnarf> that
[10:58:04] <gnarf> or
[10:58:18] <gnarf> .find( selector ).addBack( selector )

[11:03:01] <Scalabanga> Is there a plugin so it masks the input field with (___) ___-____ for phone, but the mask stays there as they type in the number?
[11:03:41] <Forbidd3n> Sorry, was signed in a 2nd name
[11:03:53] <Forbidd3n> plugin question was mine
[11:05:22] <Saaether> Forbidd3n http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/

[11:09:26] <BadCodSmell> How do I get jquery to not try to correct generated html fragments?
[11:09:41] <BadCodSmell> I want to put some stuff into a table but jquery appears to be meddling with it
[11:10:05] <bambu> Any comments http://pastie.org/5992405?
[11:10:30] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: The HTML valid?
[11:11:04] <BadCodSmell> appears to be
[11:11:24] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: Have a fiddizzle of it?
[11:11:45] <BadCodSmell> MAybe it's because it doesn't like <script>
[11:11:47] <BadCodSmell> hmm yes
[11:12:09] <BadCodSmell> I need a tag I can put anywhere that has no visual effect
[11:12:24] <BadCodSmell> I wonder if comment tags are the only thing
[11:12:56] <BadCodSmell> hmm jquery does pick them up rather than ignore them
[11:13:11] <BadCodSmell> I guess I might have to switch from script to that
[11:14:37] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: whats this html look like?
[11:14:42] <gnarf> this situation seems smelly
[11:14:52] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: Why do you need to do that? Can you use data- attributes and apply the data to that in a logical manner?
[11:14:54] <gnarf> maybe you should be using a data-* attrib on a tag?
[11:15:02] <BadCodSmell> It's templating
[11:15:08] <BadCodSmell> The script is used for bulk data
[11:15:25] <BadCodSmell> obviously needs to be comment so not to trach the dom but now I need to figure out how to get jquery to select/work with that
[11:15:35] <gnarf> are you using a templating library, or like rolling your own?
[11:16:09] <BadCodSmell> I have my own, it works and does so very well apart from these peculiarities in jquery that I have never had to worry about before
[11:16:36] <BadCodSmell> and the browser deciding to take it upon its self to fix html
[11:16:39] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: jQuery will ignore <script> tags unless it is injected directly into the dom ... i.e. via .append()
[11:16:47] <BadCodSmell> I don't really get why you can't have a script in those places.
[11:16:58] <gnarf> you shouldn't have non-standards compliant html in the first place
[11:17:29] <Drager> BadCodSmell: Which templating language are you using?
[11:18:26] <BadCodSmell> Nope, when you have $('<script></script><td></td>') see what happens
[11:18:38] <BadCodSmell> the td is stripped
[11:18:48] <djQuery> Drager, he is using the roll your own   or the re-invint the wheel one
[11:18:52] <BadCodSmell> I actually strip the script myself after so it's kind of redundant
[11:19:14] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: well, generating td outside of a tr is actually a tricky thing to do
[11:19:16] <BadCodSmell> But it does it anyway, it's either jquery or the browser when it make a dom structure
[11:19:23] <gnarf> we fix it
[11:19:26] <BadCodSmell> It gets appended to a tr
[11:19:28] <gnarf> if the <td> is the first tag
[11:19:37] <gnarf> yeah, but the way we convert strings to dom
[11:19:44] <BadCodSmell> So put the script at the end?
[11:20:01] <Drager> djQuery: haha alright
[11:20:01] <gnarf> would probably help, but thats not a valid location for a <script> in the first place ;)
[11:20:10] <gnarf> whats inside the <script>
[11:20:14] <gnarf> is it actually JS?
[11:20:21] <BadCodSmell> json, strict
[11:20:27] <BadCodSmell> at the end works
[11:20:33] <BadCodSmell> how unintuitive
[11:20:38] <gnarf> <td data-json="...."></tD>
[11:20:48] <gnarf> probably better for everyone if you did something like that ^^^
[11:20:55] <BadCodSmell> The problem with that is that it really fattens up the html
[11:21:01] <BadCodSmell> I do
[11:21:02] <sorahn> is there a better way to write this find statement:  $inactiveTabs = $navTabs.find(':not(.active) a'),
[11:21:08] <BadCodSmell> But sometimes it's too epic
[11:21:16] <gnarf> BadCodSmell: well, if you are generating it
[11:21:20] <gnarf> you could also do
[11:21:23] <BadCodSmell> and unreadable, and a horror with escaping
[11:21:30] <BillCriswell> sorahn: How deep does .find() have to look?
[11:21:30] <gnarf> $("<td>...</td>").data("json", data)
[11:21:38] <gnarf> then it's not in the inspector
[11:21:43] <BadCodSmell> Nothing is generated, the templating is pure static
[11:22:00] <sorahn> BillCriswell: just 2 levels.  $navTabs is a ul, and the .active could be on a li.
[11:22:01] <BadCodSmell> pure js then pure html and data to tell templating exactly what to do
[11:22:23] <BadCodSmell> Anyway I think I've solved all the complications I was having, thanks
[11:22:24] <BillCriswell> sorahn: Not getting much better than that then.
[11:22:32] <sorahn> ul > ( li > a )*4
[11:22:48] <BillCriswell> Zen Coding?
[11:23:00] <sorahn> no, i was just trying to explain the layout
[11:23:00] <BillCriswell> Which was renamed to Emmet why I was sleeping.
[11:23:02] <BillCriswell> while*
[11:23:29] <sorahn> my coworker seems to think that using .not instead of :not would be faster
[11:23:43] <BadCodSmell> There's a person for each roll and code mixed with templating was really making working like that unfeasable
[11:23:47] <BadCodSmell> in theory it would be
[11:23:53] <BadCodSmell> because it is not having to parse it
[11:23:59] <BadCodSmell> but just profile it on different browsers
[11:24:11] <sorahn> well, i can't get .not to return the same matches
[11:24:14] <BadCodSmell> except ie because no one care too much about ie as long as it is fast enough to not be considered broken
[11:24:27] <sorahn> if i do .not('.active').find('a');
[11:24:28] <gnarf> sorahn: so, the selector is prolly best
[11:24:35] <gnarf> thats not really the same
[11:24:45] <gnarf> its more like
[11:25:07] <gnarf> .find( "a" ).filter( function() { return !$(this).closest(".active").length; })
[11:25:13] <gnarf> the find
[11:25:24] <gnarf> is looking for children that match selector
[11:25:38] <sorahn> right, oh, but not is looking for that in the selector
[11:25:39] <gnarf> where $navTabs.not( ".active" ) filters the navTabs
[11:25:44] <sorahn> right
[11:25:46] <BillCriswell> sorahn: It'll all take just about the same amount of time. No reason to worry about it at that level.
[11:25:46] <sorahn> i see
[11:26:06] <gnarf> sorahn: .find( "li" ).not( ".active" ).find( "a" )
[11:26:14] <gnarf> sorahn: at which point
[11:26:16] <gnarf> you ask yourself
[11:26:23] <sorahn> right, it would only be faster if I already had a local object of *all* the tabs, and i just wanted to pull the non-active ones
[11:26:25] <gnarf> is this really a performance issue? :)
[11:26:31] <BillCriswell> "Why am I complicating the fuck out of this?"
[11:26:40] <sorahn> because my code reviewer asked me to :(
[11:26:49] <BadCodSmell> One is going up, one is going down?
[11:26:56] <sorahn> Thanks!
[11:26:59] <gnarf> fair, is this in a tight loop, or whatever?
[11:27:16] <gnarf> if it runs like once, the "speed" will be unnoticable
[11:27:40] <gnarf> your prolly talking like <1ms difference
[11:27:52] <sorahn> gnarf: no it's not, but it has to run on shitty mobile devices
[11:27:52] <BadCodSmell> Profiling tools on firefox and chrome are pretty easy to use and good, people shouldn't really have these questions very often
[11:28:11] <sorahn> we're just trying to optimize where we can (if possible)
[11:28:16] <gnarf> sorahn: if it only runs once on a click event, its not your bottleneck no matter what
[11:28:36] <sorahn> its not a click event, it's in response to a server command, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a problem
[11:28:47] <sorahn> but cool. I'm glad to know I was right :)
[11:28:49] <gnarf> sorahn: yeah, i mean, really having the "li"'s already found
[11:28:54] <sorahn> yayay!
[11:29:05] <gnarf> and a quick .filter() on those would probably be the most performant
[11:29:14] <gnarf> not having to .find() at all is your best bet ;)
[11:29:14] <sorahn> who what
[11:29:41] <gnarf> performance wise, storing refs to things like that when they aren't dynamic
[11:29:52] <gnarf> always fastest
[11:30:01] <gnarf> if you can avoid traversing DOM, do so
[11:30:08] <sorahn> hmm
[11:30:17] <sorahn> let me paste the whole thing into gist
[11:30:55] * sorahn prepares for public shaming...
[11:30:56] <sorahn> https://gist.github.com/b9462f2a045e1e0c2669
[11:33:16] <gnarf> sorahn: this.el ?
[11:33:38] <sorahn> oh, sorry, this.el is the div right above the ul
[11:33:40] <sorahn> me edits
[11:34:16] <gnarf> yeah, thats pretty solid
[11:34:23] <gnarf> aren't gonna save a lot of time there
[11:34:40] <gnarf> unless you already had something like this.tabs = this.el.find('.nav-tabs')
[11:34:47] <gnarf> you could skip the query again
[11:34:57] <sorahn> thats the only place
[11:34:59] <gnarf> but really, it shouldn't be any trouble
[11:35:03] <sorahn> awesome
[11:35:04] <sorahn> thanks
[11:35:14] <gnarf> only suggestion
[11:35:19] <sorahn> refresh if you want to see the html
[11:35:30] <gnarf> $inactiveTabs.each( fn ) instead of $.each( $inactiveTabs, fn )
[11:35:43] <sorahn> :o
[11:35:56] <sorahn> thats to save starting a new instance of $ right?
[11:36:08] <gnarf> nope, just looks cleaner imo
[11:36:15] <gnarf> less typing too
[11:36:16] <gnarf> :)
[11:36:32] <sorahn> oh
[11:36:46] <sorahn> can I drop it in wholesale?
[11:36:59] <sorahn> $inactiveTabs.each( this.proxy(function(i, tab) {
[11:37:19] <gnarf> yup
[11:37:26] <sorahn> sweet
[11:51:19] <scriabin> can I load a js file into the DOM from the inspector?
[11:52:19] <RA3OR> help, $.format.date(new Date(), "M d, Y KK:mm:ss:SSS a") is not returning anything
[11:52:46] <RA3OR> TypeError: $.format is undefined
[11:53:19] <RA3OR> $.now() returns timestamp, how can i format it?
[11:53:39] <scriabin> strftime?
[11:53:43] <pavelkukov> $.datepicker.formatDate( format, date, settings )
[11:53:44] <scriabin> just a guess
[11:53:55] <santamaria> Guys, in jquery sortable's update handler func(ev, ui), how can I find out if the current handler is running for the source list and not the target list?

[11:55:40] <deanclkclk> anyone here familiar with webKitTransitionEnd?
[11:55:58] <savid> I'm wanting to set the value of a specific form field by name. Currently I'm using $($("#the_form")[0].the_field).val().  Is there a cleaner way to do this?

[11:57:10] <Mottie> savid: try $("#the_form [name='the_field']").val()
[11:58:37] <pmercado> I have this issue: http://www.devaffair.com/2011/09/new-datezerotime-is-not-function-jquery.html   i'm wondering if jqueryui depends from this file
[11:59:04] <pmercado> I'm using last jquery and jqueryui files
[12:01:08] <gnarf> pmercado: um
[12:01:47] <gnarf> there are no instances of .zeroTime in jquery-ui.js
[12:01:56] <gnarf> so thats not in jQuery
[12:02:42] <pmercado> uhm
[12:02:49] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/jquery-ui.js -- search for zeroTime
[12:03:04] <gnarf> where is the error?
[12:03:14] <gnarf> file/line number?
[12:03:51] <gnarf> santamaria: does it run for both?
[12:04:10] <gnarf> santamaria: console.log( this, event, ui );
[12:04:28] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure something in one of those three will point at which is source and which is target
[12:04:36] <gnarf> i remember tackling that once
[12:04:47] <BillCriswell> gnarf, code hunter.
[12:05:00] <BillCriswell> Oh, read that as "tracking".
[12:05:11] <gnarf> even better
[12:05:12] <fission6> whats your peferred way to check if an object has a key?
[12:05:21] <gnarf> fission6: depends on the situation
[12:05:27] <santamaria> I was looking inside them. I'm glancing through them again.
[12:05:36] <gnarf> if the value should also be truthy: object.key
[12:05:43] <gnarf> if you want to know if its there
[12:05:46] <gnarf> "key" in object
[12:05:55] <santamaria> Also came across this check on the forum: this === ui.item.parent()[0]
[12:06:03] <gnarf> if you want to know its not inherited from a prototype object.hasOwnProperty( "key" )
[12:07:04] <pmercado> gnarf: thanks, i've checked and find the error
[12:07:06] <pmercado> :)
[12:07:06] <fission6> gnarf http://dpaste.org/KwjZi/
[12:09:46] <gnarf> fission6: is 0 going to be an id?
[12:10:01] <gnarf> then you need "id" in object && object.id
[12:10:05] <gnarf> but like it will return false
[12:10:13] <gnarf> which isn't really what you want either
[12:10:39] <fission6> well the real is is that all objects should have an id if they exist
[12:10:42] <fission6> so i redid it as
[12:10:59] <fission6> http://dpaste.org/KHcAc/
[12:11:33] <gnarf> can't you just _.uniq( _.pluck( list, "id" ) ) ?
[12:12:44] <gnarf> or wait
[12:13:03] <gnarf> you want to remove dupes from list where they have the same id
[12:13:07] <gnarf> not get a list of ids
[12:13:08] <gnarf> right?
[12:14:35] <markalanevans> Is there a way i can delay the click that a users does that should take them off the site.
[12:14:47] <markalanevans> For example, they click a button, I want to track it.
[12:15:02] <markalanevans> But it has to register w/ my tracking tool before the redirect of the href happens.
[12:15:26] <gnarf> fission6: you could reuse your iterator there and _( list ).filter( iterator ).uniq( iterator ).value()
[12:16:26] <fission6> i don't think you can chain like that can you
[12:19:17] <gnarf> fission6: with _( list ) yeah
[12:19:30] <gnarf> fission6: http://underscorejs.org/#chaining
[12:19:53] <NickNack> question...
[12:20:12] <NickNack> what function can i use to get the width of a image that hasnt been loaded...
[12:20:23] <gnarf> NickNack: none
[12:20:30] <gnarf> NickNack: you ahve to wait for it to be loaded
[12:20:34] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[12:20:34] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[12:20:52] <NickNack> hmm
[12:21:12] <fission6> gnarl did you try that? i don't think that works
[12:21:32] <NickNack> well... im in a pickle now
[12:22:23] <NickNack> what if i load the image, does it have to be in a div or something to get the width of it?
[12:22:33] <NickNack> can i use load() to do it?
[12:22:35] <gnarf> fission6: nope i didn't but it should
[12:22:42] <NickNack> or am i going into ajax now
[12:22:54] <gnarf> fission6: lemme load up a jsbin
[12:27:58] <gnarf> fission6: http://jsbin.com/ojafor/1/edit
[12:28:03] <gnarf> fission6: sorry, _.chain( list )....
[12:28:07] <fission6> yea
[12:28:13] <fission6> that makes sense
[12:28:14] <fission6> thanks
[12:31:48] <NickNack> fixed my problem =)
[12:32:08] <alaing> what is the most popular minifier
[12:32:23] <gnarf> alaing: we use uglify
[12:32:34] <Daghdha> lo
[12:32:41] <gnarf> alaing: closure compiler is a close second
[12:32:53] <ryanneufeld> we us closure in production
[12:32:57] <ryanneufeld> *we use
[12:33:03] <gnarf> alaing: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
[12:33:08] <ryanneufeld> as long as it works, and doesn't mangle your code
[12:33:15] <ryanneufeld> any minification is good minification
[12:33:27] <ryanneufeld> IMHO
[12:33:31] <gnarf> we actually use uglify2 on jquery now
[12:33:42] <gnarf> but its still in progress
[12:33:44] <gnarf> totally usable
[12:33:49] <gnarf> and gives you source maps
[12:33:51] <gnarf> which is hot
[12:34:00] <alaing> url?
[12:34:07] <gnarf> https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2
[12:34:42] <gnarf> npm install -g uglify-js
[12:35:20] <alaing> is closure compiler an only compiler?
[12:35:34] <gnarf> closure has a ton of crazy options
[12:35:52] <gnarf> its java
[12:35:53] <alaing> doh i cant install applications on my server
[12:36:09] <gnarf> alaing: you can install without the -g
[12:36:10] <gnarf> and get
[12:36:18] <alaing> sorry I meant to say is closure an online compiler?
[12:36:36] <alaing> I dont have admin right
[12:36:37] <gnarf> you won't find a "minify my code" service you want to use in production
[12:36:39] <gnarf> thats silly
[12:36:45] <gnarf> just write a build step
[12:36:55] <gnarf> before you upload the code, it builds the minified
[12:37:34] <dcherman> alaing: i'd personally recommend not even using a minifier directly.  use grunt ( a javascript build framework ), and cherry pick one of the minification tasks available for it
[12:37:45] <dcherman> then when you want to make your build process smarter, it'd dead simple.
[12:38:21] <Daghdha> . is selector for classes right?
[12:38:34] <alaing> gnarf out of interest i tried your install and it complained saying :"install:missing file operand
[12:38:57] <Daghdha> I am trying this: $("#movedLegendHere").html($(".highcharts-legend").html("")); $(".highcharts-legend").html("");
[12:39:02] <gnarf> alaing: do you have npm ?
[12:39:25] <gnarf> alaing: using linux/mac or windows?
[12:39:29] <alaing> dcherman: so are there tools to automatically minify when your save/upload to a server?
[12:39:38] <alaing> gnarf. redhat
[12:40:05] <gnarf> alaing: do you have nodejs?
[12:40:06] <gnarf> node -v ?
[12:40:27] <alaing> no.
[12:40:27] <dcherman> alaing: to automatically?  probably not out of the box, but you can just write a grunt task that minifies and then uploads your file.   automation ftw.
[12:40:55] <gnarf> git clone https://github.com/isaacs/nave.git ; sudo nave/nave.sh usemain stable; sudo npm install -g uglify-js
[12:40:58] <gnarf> alaing: ^^^
[12:41:05] <alaing> that would be ideal for work. I
[12:41:45] <alaing> unfortunately no git either
[12:42:04] <gnarf> alaing: rpm install it?
[12:42:17] <gnarf> yum install git
[12:42:21] <gnarf> yeh?
[12:42:26] <gnarf> i forget my redhat
[12:42:30] <alaing> Ok, without all the restriction I have at work
[12:42:40] <alaing> let me try it on my home machine
[12:43:14] <Ziber> So, I know iframe's are frowned upon. I'm trying to get a similar result that an iframe provides, but without the need for redudant page requests for a CSS file. Thoughts?
[12:43:23] <alaing> I have clone a jquery plugin repo. I've done changes to it and I would like to provide a minified version. Whats the best way. I'm using Adobe dreamweaver
[12:43:32] <gnarf> seriously, on a side note.  If your employer doesn't let you install software on your own development environment...
[12:43:56] <alaing> gnarf working for a gov department its difficult to get things installed on the server
[12:44:08] <gnarf> you don't install this on the server
[12:44:13] <gnarf> you install it on your computer
[12:44:29] <gnarf> and seriously, using dreamweaver?
[12:44:32] <alaing> the server is controlled by a 3rd party IT supploer
[12:44:54] <gnarf> i thought you were using linux
[12:44:57] <gnarf> forget the server
[12:44:59] <alaing> ok well on my home computer its win 7
[12:45:03] <gnarf> okay
[12:45:25] <alaing> Sorry forget the whole work example for the moment
[12:45:35] <gnarf> then you should install nodejs from http://nodejs.org/download/
[12:46:04] <Heath__> Hey, I have a scale from 1 to 10 in a ui slider, I want the animation to be smooth when dragging but lock to the closest round number when released, is this possible?
[12:46:14] <alaing> I have github and clone a jquery plugin and did a fix to a bug but I would like to now minify it
[12:46:34] <gnarf> alaing: we get that
[12:46:38] <gnarf> you need a minified
[12:46:41] <gnarf> minifier
[12:46:48] <gnarf> uglify-js runs on nodejs
[12:46:50] <gnarf> install nodejs
[12:46:58] <gnarf> then open your command prompt
[12:47:03] <gnarf> npm install -g uglify-js
[12:47:04] <alaing> ok just downloading nodejs
[12:47:26] <gnarf> uglify-js -o file.min.js file.js
[12:47:30] <gnarf> http://freshbrewedcode.com/jonathancreamer/2012/01/10/minify-javascript-using-uglifyjs-and-nodejs/
[12:49:29] <alaing> Thanks gnarf just working through that excellant guide
[12:50:20] <alaing> gnarf out of interest do you reckon you would need admin rights on a machien to install node js or is there a standalone version
[12:50:57] <gnarf> alaing: generally you should be an administrator
[12:52:16] <gnarf> alaing: but like i said before -- developers shouldn't be censored from their tools
[12:52:49] <alaing> gnarf I agree!!!! thats the one thing I hate about my job
[12:53:08] <alaing> gnarf.....we still on IE7
[12:53:14] <alaing> and win xp
[12:53:34] <alaing> we had to fight tooth and nail to get FF
[12:53:38] <alaing> and then its only 3.5
[12:53:59] <BillCriswell> IE7... they must hate you.
[12:54:09] <gnarf> alaing: chrome
[12:54:32] <alaing> they only just starting to "investigate" on the impact of upgrading to win7
[12:54:34] <litenull> oh my hof
[12:54:36] <litenull> god*
[12:54:42] <gnarf> alaing: run away
[12:54:52] <BillCriswell> I remember my IE5 and IE6 days... if I made it through that I can make it through a 5 hour water boarding session.
[12:54:55] <alaing> some days its tempting
[12:55:01] <ghs> Someone knows a API for to edit input field ?
[12:55:09] <Mottie> litenull: oh my hasselhoff?
[12:55:15] <litenull> XD
[12:55:16] <alaing> its only been about 4 years since we moved to IE7
[12:56:08] <litenull> alaing: gov and using outdated browsers.. thats cute..
[12:56:41] <litenull> i wonder whats the security department doing
[12:56:50] <gnarf> alaing: or tell your IT director to get his head out of his ass and let you have a machine you have admin on... http://serverfault.com/questions/12830/is-locking-down-a-developers-machine-more-effort-than-its-worth
[12:57:20] <gnarf> alaing: also, check out http://browserstack.com - great service for developers that need to test on wide variety of browsers
[12:57:28] <alaing> litenull: tell me about it. at one stage they were looking at taking FF away from us because it caused a secruity risk
[12:57:41] <alaing> as if IE7 is any safer
[12:57:45] <gnarf> alaing: just get a better job
[12:58:24] <litenull> hahah omg
[12:58:51] <alaing> gnarf - fortuantely we only developing internal websties so we know our websites only have to support IE7
[12:59:04] <alaing> although we do ensure it works in FF as well
[12:59:08] <ravenzz> today.. what about tomorrow?
[12:59:42] <alaing> ravenzz: Oh I'm helping our team keep up with it
[12:59:51] <alaing> already got them to start usign jquery
[13:00:03] <litenull> what version
[13:00:06] <litenull> 0.1 ?
[13:00:08] <alaing> and I'm now the front-end lead developer
[13:00:09] <litenull> :)
[13:00:20] <alaing> lol no 1.8
[13:00:23] <litenull> jk
[13:01:03] <alaing> ok hold your breath.........we dont use svn or git
[13:01:18] <ravenzz> but ftp!
[13:01:51] <alaing> yip we have sftp
[13:02:02] <ravenzz> wu-ftp 2.6.0
[13:02:06] <ravenzz> +d
[13:02:13] <Mottie> alaing: don't you get tired making punch cards to program the computer?
[13:02:22] <litenull> :D
[13:02:23] <Ziber> So, I know iframe's are frowned upon. I'm trying to get a similar result that an iframe provides, but without the need for redudant page requests for a CSS file. Thoughts?
[13:02:35] <alaing> pmsl
[13:02:41] <Ziber> I want to show a page on a remote URL.
[13:03:23] <Daghdha> i can't get it to work :/
[13:06:12] <Daghdha> How can i fill a div with the value of another div when that source div only has a class and not an ID?
[13:06:16] <scriabin> Brodingo: if you're still here - I made use of $.getScript("https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-popover.js") but I got an error
[13:06:25] <scriabin> maybe I don't understandhow to use it
[13:07:18] <Brodingo> that is a website
[13:07:44] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: Grab it using $('.className')
[13:08:17] <alaing> just a question about uglify
[13:08:52] <alaing> uglifyjs -o myFile.build.js myFile.js  (is myFile.build.js the output or input file?)
[13:09:22] <Ziber> why is there a script called uglify?
[13:09:26] <dcherman> gnarf: question for you ( though this might be a jaubourg thing ):  is this considered a part of the public jqXHR api?  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L396-L403
[13:09:38] <Ziber> probably output. -o = output.
[13:09:39] <shoky> alaing: i'd imagine -o means output
[13:10:25] <shoky> Ziber: it's a javascript minifier
[13:10:37] <shoky> jquery uses it
[13:10:46] <Ziber> oh, to make them reduce lines/
[13:10:48] <Ziber> *?
[13:10:58] <shoky> to reduce filesize, yah
[13:11:02] <Ziber> gotcha
[13:11:08] <gnarf> dcherman: not documented
[13:11:13] <gnarf> dcherman: so i would say no
[13:11:28] <Ziber> anyone here able to help me reproduce the result of an iframe (loading a remote page into a div) without an iframe?
[13:11:42] <gnarf> dcherman: but might wanna mail julian on that one
[13:12:00] <gnarf> or tweet him
[13:12:12] <NoiseEee> Ziber: but then you'd have two <html>,<body>, <head> tags etc
[13:12:22] <gnarf> maybe it just never got documented
[13:12:23] <gnarf> :)
[13:12:32] <Ziber> In the remote URL (which I control, too), it'd just be an HTML snippet.
[13:12:36] <dcherman> gnarf: yea, i'll tweet @ him - i'm tinkering with it to support a smart ajax retry plugin
[13:12:49] <dcherman> if it really isn't public, the first case in that if statement will never be true either, so its dead code
[13:12:55] <Daghdha> Bill: I am, i can't get it to fill somehow
[13:12:56] <alaing> brb just rebooting to enable uglifyjs
[13:13:05] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/load/ @ Ziber
[13:13:27] <Ziber> NoiseEee: will that allow an external domain?
[13:13:57] <Ziber> I've been having problems with that.
[13:15:42] <NoiseEee> Ziber: do whatcha gotta do to enable CORS
[13:15:48] <Ziber> cors?
[13:16:15] <NoiseEee> http://enable-cors.org/
[13:17:30] <Qbix1> hey guys
[13:17:32] <Qbix1> what about my suggestion
[13:17:39] <Qbix1> right now you have $.extend and other functions call isPlainObject, which does some magic with blacklists, by trying to make sure what an object is NOT
[13:17:44] <Qbix1> instead, you can simply have isPlainObject call Object.prototype.toString.apply(obj) === '[Object object]' and poof!
[13:17:48] <Qbix1> in any case, it would make jQuery code a lot simpler
[13:18:24] <Daghdha> BillCriswell: My classname has a - in it, can that cause issues
[13:18:39] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: Nope.
[13:19:48] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: $('.class-a').html($('.class-b').html());
[13:20:36] <Daghdha> Looks like i  tried that before.. i will try though
[13:23:10] <Daghdha> don't work here. Hmm, accidental colours/stylet here. sorry
[13:23:19] <fairuz_> Hi guys. I have a button like this. <button id="button1"  disabled> MyButton </button> . How to re-enable this button? I use $('#button1').removeAttr('disabled') but it didn't work. Thanks
[13:24:53] <Ziber> Alright, so I enabled cors (with the header on my remote page), now there's no JS error, but no content shows up.
[13:28:08] <Daghdha> when copy/move HTML does it also move child elements?
[13:28:15] <litenull> Ziber: tell more. what do you mean no content shows up
[13:29:35] <thang> fairuz_: looks like it works fine here: http://jsfiddle.net/pbn6b/
[13:30:16] <Daghdha> aw i se what's going on
[13:30:52] <anew> what is the backbone channel again ?
[13:31:29] <shoky> #documentcloud
[13:31:54] <anew> thx shoky
[13:31:55] <Daghdha> BillCriswell: It's all rendered with javascripts
[13:32:01] <anew> thug life
[13:32:02] <fairuz_> thang: thanks, found the issue. binding with click works and not with tap. (this is jqm).
[13:32:11] <Daghdha> I think it is empty when i copy it.. nvm, thanks for your help :)
[13:32:18] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:32:53] <scriabin> Brodingo: ok I got a clue and gave it a url which is only the js file
[13:33:44] <Brodingo> yay
[13:36:37] <scriabin> Brodingo: so now when I use a jquery selector and add the popover function, am I supposed to see a popover in the browser?
[13:36:58] <Brodingo> i have no idea
[13:37:15] <amh345> is it possible to use a live event on a toggle?   $('.some_class').live("toggle", function() { ….  ?
[13:37:30] <amh345> im getting zero results on my test. so im guessing it's not.
[13:40:07] <thang> amh345: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10864353/on-toggle-working-together
[13:41:29] <amh345> thang: hrm. i dont think that will work with what im trying to do.   the toggle actually replaces the parent div with new content.
[13:41:47] <amh345> the new content has the same div class name though.
[13:42:08] <amh345> i just need my toggle to pick up the new dom
[13:42:38] <thang> ok lets back track a second,
[13:44:25] <thang> live() has been deprecated in favor of on(), and 'toggle' isnt an actual event that can be bound by those methods
[13:44:34] <thang> what exactly are you trying to do
[13:45:29] <Forbidd3n> Is there anyway to clear input fields when you clone an element that contains them?
[13:45:43] <litenull> amh345: i suggest you make your own toggle and use on (you can write the status in .data())
[13:45:50] <litenull> use .on()
[13:45:53] <litenull> *
[13:45:55] <litenull> :)
[13:46:08] <amh345> im trying to paste my js in a gist. but the formatting is off
[13:46:08] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, you can just set .val('');
[13:46:27] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: yeah if I was cloning just an input
[13:46:38] <Forbidd3n> I am cloning a div with input within it
[13:47:10] <Forbidd3n> item = $('div').clone();
[13:47:21] <Forbidd3n> item.find('input').val('');
[13:47:24] <amh345> here's a jsfiddle of only the jquery.   it's a bit crude right now.  but the more important point is it doesnt work. http://jsfiddle.net/w2tsT/
[13:47:26] <Forbidd3n> something like that
[13:47:34] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, that should do it
[13:47:46] <chovy> how do i check if an variable is a jquery object or not
[13:48:07] <djQuery> might want to test radio, checkboxes and selects though
[13:48:43] <litenull> amh345: which version of jquery are you using
[13:49:03] <amh345> litenull: 1.7.2
[13:49:30] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: that worked
[13:50:11] <djQuery> chovy if(obj.jquery)
[13:50:43] <djQuery> chovy, jquery objects have a jquery property that returns the version of jquery
[13:50:47] <chovy> thatnks
[13:52:16] <litenull> amh345: look at http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:52:32] <litenull> check the section where there is .live, .on
[13:55:11] <amh345> litenull: .on toggles it's once, but not again.
[13:55:37] <litenull> amh345: write your own toggle, and append the status with .data()
[13:57:22] <samholmes> How do I make a jquery mobile button it's original input?
[13:57:36] <samholmes> I want to make a custom button of my own, without jquery getting in the way
[13:58:05] <litenull> amh345: .on ( function() { var status = $(this).data('status'); if (status == 'on') { dosomething } and so on
[13:58:58] <alaing> how do you submit changes to a jquery pluing on github
[13:59:04] <alaing> I've cloned the repo
[13:59:07] <alaing> done the changes
[13:59:49] <litenull> alaing: using a git client ?
[14:00:00] <litenull> :P
[14:00:07] <alaing> I am. I'm using the github one for windows

[14:03:24] <litenull> alaing: are you trying to push changes on the official plugin repo ?
[14:03:24] <alaing> it opened up the Github app for windows

[14:04:12] <alaing> so how can I submit my changes
[14:04:36] <DavidSullivan> alaing, you probably need to fork it, make your changes to the fork then submit pull request of your change
[14:05:04] <javalover> hi guys i know this is wrong channel, but does anyone here know how to use a hex editor?
[14:05:13] <alaing> how do you fork it?
[14:05:18] <alaing> from github
[14:05:44] <DavidSullivan> alaing, you go to the project page in git then click the fork button
[14:05:46] <javalover> the reason i ask is that i'm trying to just select all using xvi32 but I don't see how to do it...
[14:05:55] <NoiseEee> alaing: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
[14:05:56] <alaing> i clicked the "Clone in Windows" button on that repo page
[14:06:32] <alaing> I dont see a fork option
[14:06:54] <DavidSullivan> alaing, are you actualy logged into github?
[14:06:59] <NoiseEee> alaing: its the icon with the "18" beside it.
[14:07:09] <alaing> I am....do I need to create a repo?
[14:07:17] <alaing> oh ok
[14:07:37] <alaing> ok done that
[14:07:46] <alaing> do I then pull that one?
[14:08:01] <DavidSullivan> alaing, make your changes to your fork
[14:08:01] <NoiseEee> alaing: read the page i linked
[14:08:37] <DavidSullivan> then go to your change in github and submit a pull request

[14:22:36] <Forbidd3n> is it possible to get the parent node of an element and then get the index of which it is within the parent
[14:22:52] <Forbidd3n> simplified, just get the index of the element with it's parent node
[14:25:13] <Jakobud_> var parent = $(this).parent();  $(parent).children().each(function(){
[14:25:42] <Jakobud_> if ( $(this) == index ) { // match found }}
[14:25:47] <Jakobud_> something along those lines maybe
[14:26:05] <Jakobud_> sounds like it is possible

[15:03:06] <Forbidd3n> anyway to get the first child of a parent without using children(’:first-child’).
[15:03:23] <ericandrewlewis> looks like full calendar is good for a large one, but doesn't come widget sized http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[15:03:51] <Forbidd3n> I thought this would work - .children(0).
[15:10:04] <coldhead> Forbidd3n: .find('> *:first')
[15:10:07] <coldhead> ericandrewlewis: transfrom: scale(50%) ?

[15:19:47] <jost> In my application, there is an iframe, and the document it shows has some input fields. Since I've upgraded to jQuery 1.9.0 (from 1.7.2), the input fields don't get focus events anymore when clicking on them.
[15:19:54] <jost> Why, and how to fix that?
[15:20:52] <jost> the "click" events come through. Also, this happens *not* in IE7 + IE8. Can anyone point me to a way where the "focus"-event might get lost?
[15:24:00] <grafi> dont get focus? that would be a general problem then?
[15:24:38] <ThoMe> emm

[15:25:02] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[15:27:08] <jost> grafi, yes, it seems general, and as far as I can say, it is triggered by jQuery... I've just found a bug report which reports a similar problem, but in IE: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12319
[15:27:18] <grafi> blub is the domain with .com etc pp ThoMe ?
[15:27:36] <jost> focussing the input elements is actually possible, but only when using the tab key
[15:27:56] <grafi> that sounds very strange jost
[15:29:41] <jost> pushing buttons, checkboxes and radiobuttons works

[15:40:10] <danheberden> bil`: no
[15:40:31] <bil`> bummer
[15:40:48] <danheberden> bil`: but you could USE inArray to do that yourself
[15:41:02] <danheberden> or just loop and do it yourself
[15:41:21] <danheberden> bil`: or flatten the array

[16:19:15] <Tiwg> Hi, is anyone online at this time of night?
[16:19:47] <Tiwg> I need to ask if there is any resource out there that I could read in order to learn properly how to extend JQuery, i.e. generate a plug-in
[16:20:01] <coldhead> did you read the plugin author tutorial?
[16:20:16] <coldhead> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[16:20:35] <Tiwg> Hey there coldhead, thanks... that is exactly what I was lokking for
[16:20:38] <Tiwg> *looking
[16:21:12] <coldhead> it's the standard guide :)
[16:21:16] <coldhead> good luck!
[16:21:27] <Tiwg> Could not find it... must have been dropped on the head as a child
[16:21:39] <hateIE> having some trouble with datetimepicker again.. http://jsfiddle.net/fmc7b/
[16:22:40] <coldhead> happens to the best of us
[16:23:07] <garbagecollectio> anyone heard of Zepto
[16:23:36] <gf3> No, is it new?
[16:23:45] <Tiwg> Well, I am off to consume this knowledge then... once again thanks coldhead... Cheerz all
[16:24:09] <coldhead> isn't zepto that library which is 100% compatible with jQUery but much smaller and faster?
[16:24:15] <coldhead> *100%*
[16:25:14] <snover> i think it’s actually over 100% compatible coldhead
[16:25:34] <DavidSullivan> says its for modern browsers so to make it faster they probably just dropped all the old browser support
[16:25:35] <grafi> hm the homepage gives of a gay vibe to me ... not that thats a bad thing ...
[16:25:42] <coldhead> i wouldn't be surprised
[16:25:50] <coldhead> it's bad that you're using gay in a pejorative sense, grafi
[16:26:00] <grafi> yeah i know
[16:26:48] <grafi> but still
[16:26:49] <grafi> :P
[16:26:49] <DavidSullivan> zepto stays lean by not attempting to fix ancient "browsers"
[16:26:56] <hateIE> nm i worked it out lol :) date.parse's default output is the correct format for setting the date + time confusion tried to reign
[16:27:34] <DavidSullivan> no matter how small zepto is, if you are useing a CDN for jquery most likely the jquery download will be smaller
[16:27:40] <DavidSullivan> ie allready cached
[16:28:35] <hateIE> whats a cdn again?
[16:28:54] <coldhead> it's like the cloud, man

[16:29:22] <hateIE> cloud developer network?>

[16:29:36] <DavidSullivan> Content Delivery Network
[16:30:04] <hateIE> kk
[16:31:56] <nextime> DavidSullivan : there are pro and cons in using a cdn, anyway
[16:31:59] <tomasm-> hi, with $.browser removed in jquery 1.9, some of my plugins are broken.... specifically, "$.browser.msie" for IE detection. what am I supposed to use now?
[16:32:14] <nextime> and there are special cases in which a cdn isn't applicable at all
[16:33:04] <nextime> tomasm- at least to make it work *now* with nothing to fix there is a migration library that make 1.9 retro-compatibile
[16:33:16] <nextime> and the you can take your time and read the changelog
[16:33:22] <coldhead> tomasm-: you can use the jQUery migrate plugin, you can fix the plugins or you can use an older jQuery
[16:33:35] <coldhead> i like option 3 because laziness is awesome
[16:33:42] <tomasm-> well i'd prefer to fix them, but how does one detect IE browsers now?
[16:33:53] <tomasm-> coldhead, most agreed
[16:34:07] <tomasm-> $.browser.msie => ???
[16:34:11] <coldhead> you don't detect browsers, you detect features
[16:34:27] <coldhead> which is why .browser was removed
[16:34:35] <coldhead> to discourage browser racism
[16:35:03] <laver3787> !list
[16:35:20] <tomasm-> okay so then what do I use in it's place for $.browser.msie ? that's all there is in a few of my plugins
[16:35:59] <coldhead> you need to find out WHY they're looking for IE
[16:36:04] <tomasm-> i dont know why the heck it's checking for MSIE, or what IE is deficient in...
[16:36:10] <coldhead> detect the specific feature they're working around
[16:36:12] <coldhead> and detect that
[16:36:18] <coldhead> instead of detecting the browser itself
[16:36:40] <coldhead> or you can just test the user agent string
[16:36:56] <coldhead> and carry on with your browser facism
[16:37:10] <coldhead> in which case you might just use the migrate plugin adn stick with .browser
[16:37:12] <tomasm-> coldhead, well in jquery.autogrow.js, it just says "IE and Opera should never set a textarea height of 0px"
[16:37:27] <coldhead> so you'd need to test for that, somehow
[16:38:17] <tomasm-> I honestly dont have the interest in debugging browser quirks, I wouldnt have a clue, since i wasnt the developer
[16:38:34] <coldhead> so migrate plugin to the rescue!
[16:38:47] <coldhead> it's everything you love about the new jquery with your precious $.browser
[16:41:50] <tomasm-> coldhead, ok well github seems to have what appears to be a source code version, ie a bunch of js files.... not sure if there's a compiled one
[16:42:01] <tomasm-> I dont see any build instructions on the readme
[16:42:27] <tomasm-> oh i see the min.js , nm
[16:43:02] <jost> tomasm-, its on the jQuery download page
[16:43:08] <coldhead> of course there's a compiled one :)
[16:43:25] <coldhead> migrate is targeted at the lowest common denominator
[16:44:44] <tomasm-> I would imagine that until all these plugins are upgraded for jquery 1.9 (which may be a few years, if ever), that I'd not be able to figure out what these browser quirks are, in order to detect them, and even then some may not be detectable. wouldnt even know where the heck to start.
[16:44:55] <tomasm-> so I hope the jquery migrate isnt going anywhere soon
[16:46:04] <jost> tomasm-, you could use a library for  that... modernizr for example
[16:46:34] <tomasm-> how does one detect the browser, for example with modernizr?
[16:47:16] <coldhead> tomasm-: is there any reason not to use an older jquery which works fine with the plugins?
[16:47:23] <coldhead> spare yourself the heartache?
[16:48:00] <tomasm-> coldhead, well I upgraded jquery ui, and saw core was new too
[16:48:12] <smallfoot-> if I have a something in a TD and I want the 3 td before, should I do $(this).parent().prev().prev().prev().find('span') or is that bad? It could be done with an #id too
[16:49:10] <coldhead> .prevAll(':nth(3)') might work
[16:49:21] <coldhead> i can't remember what order it goes in
[16:49:28] <coldhead> maybe .prevAll().eq(3)
[16:49:54] <tomasm-> how hmmm, whats the point of jquery-migrate if it echos a warning of your use of deprecated code?
[16:50:08] <tomasm-> im gonna probably roll back. =(
[16:50:10] <coldhead> it's to help you migrate from the old version
[16:50:18] <coldhead> if you want to use the old version, use the old version
[16:50:33] <tomasm-> coldhead, but you already went out of your way to install it proactively
[16:50:55] <tomasm-> a plugin you manually installed shouldnt be saying "dont use me"
[16:51:05] <coldhead> maybe the path of least resistance is to beg your plugin authors to upgrade :\
[16:52:31] <tomasm-> coldhead, actually it's probably downgrading. unlink jquery.js and then symlink jquery-1.8.2.js to jquery.js .... but anyway, a lot of these plugins are open source code where people work on it for 6 months and then abandon the project.
[16:52:36] <DavidSullivan> I am looking for something to do what plugins are you using
[16:52:52] <SirFailzAlot> ok so i suck.. i dont know wtf im doing... but googling just has a crap ton of hits on how to put the google jquery in to word press. Any one know were there is a tutorial on how to add a library like http://terminal.jcubic.pl/ to wordpress?
[16:53:57] <tomasm-> the upside of open source is people do a lot of work FOR you. the downside, is they usually only do it for a short period of time before they abandon the project and do something else, so you have to skip around every few years and keep upgrading to different plugins
[16:54:01] <DavidSullivan> tomasm-,
[16:54:37] <coldhead> but then new people can take over, tomasm-
[16:54:43] <SirFailzAlot> guess i should by a book or something. ;-(
[16:54:46] <coldhead> you can patch the damn things yourself if no one else will
[16:55:01] <coldhead> SirFailzAlot: tw2113 is your man
[16:55:02] <DavidSullivan> SirFailzAlot, a book about what?
[16:55:05] <coldhead> but he's offline
[16:55:11] <tomasm-> coldhead, one would hope.
[16:55:23] <tomasm-> coldhead, meh
[16:55:26] <DavidSullivan> SirFailzAlot, see ?eloquent
[16:55:27] <bot-t> DavidSullivan, Couldn't find "eloquent" in jQuery Docs.
[16:55:43] <MraAlbertina> hi. do you know of any plugin that would act like a speed dial, for instance, having 0 - 9 numbers and tapping on 5,6,7 and 'GO' do something... (like go to to a page)?
[16:55:49] <DavidSullivan> http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[16:55:55] <coldhead> the thing with $.browser  is it has been deprecated for years... so people have had a LOT of time to remove it
[16:56:16] <coldhead> it's painful but it was expected
[16:56:46] <DavidSullivan> coldhead, well expected if you paid attention at all
[16:57:22] <tomasm-> well im just grabbing plugins to help my project out.... a lot of these neat rich UI plugins are short lived
[16:57:34] <ronson> MraAlbertina: That's a pretty unique idea.  I've never seen something like it but I wouldn't mind helping code it
[16:57:38] <SirFailzAlot> im trying to figure out how to add all this http://terminal.jcubic.pl/#download to a wordpress install were i can use it on some pages every once in awhile...
[16:57:40] <DavidSullivan> tomasm-, oh and there is 1.10 of migrate coming out today
[16:58:33] <DavidSullivan> tomasm-, have you submitted bugs to the plugins at are not working?
[16:58:51] <DavidSullivan> have you even gone and look to see if there are compatability bugs submited?
[16:58:55] <coldhead> DavidSullivan++
[16:59:03] <coldhead> where the fuck is tw2113
[16:59:06] <tomasm-> DavidSullivan, no, just found out about them in the last 20 minutes. i'm deciding to downgrade. dont have the time
[16:59:15] <coldhead> SirFailzAlot: are you on twitter?
[16:59:41] <MraAlbertina> ronson: :) i would appreciate. in my case i would like to have something that enable an user to click (better touch enable) on a code (of numbers) and go to a page. In a fancy way, a circular speed dial like on the old phones would be a nice idea too :9
[16:59:45] <DavidSullivan> tomasm-, every time you say you dont have the time to document an issue you loose the right to complain about the issue
[16:59:45] <coldhead> no shame in downgrading
[16:59:52] <coldhead> lose*
[16:59:59] <DavidSullivan> whatever
[17:00:13] <ronson> MraAlbertina: Circular is more complex.
[17:00:23] <tomasm-> i'll complain about it when i decide to upgrade again, when i have time and money
[17:00:23] <ronson> But basically do the HTML + CSS
[17:00:24] <SirFailzAlot> yea
[17:00:33] <ronson> then use Jquery to bind onclick and keydown events
[17:00:44] <ronson> when youre happy with the look
[17:00:54] <DavidSullivan> when was 1.9 released?
[17:00:55] <coldhead> SirFailzAlot: ping @tw2113 on twitter and summon him to IRC. or ask him for a link. he knows WP like a mofo
[17:01:14] <MraAlbertina> ronson: i believe it is. do you really go ahead of coding one? suare, rectangle, whatever?
[17:01:25] <MraAlbertina> suare/quare
[17:01:31] <MraAlbertina> err square
[17:02:17] <tomasm-> thanks guys, gotta go
[17:03:30] <DavidSullivan> I always loved customers that would not participate in the beta problem but had no problem complaining when release came out and thier bug was not addressed or new ones introduced
[17:05:58] <ronson> MraAlbertina: http://codepen.io/TheSisb/pen/lAmga
[17:06:02] <ronson> fork it
[17:06:43] <ronson> Improve the look
[17:06:46] <MraAlbertina> ronson: nice :)
[17:06:49] <ronson> until you are super happy
[17:06:52] <DavidSullivan> ronson, I was thinking of something that would attach itself to a input
[17:06:53] <ronson> then add basic JS
[17:07:08] <ronson> Attaching can be done after - do the design first
[17:07:22] <DavidSullivan> should be fun to do as a ui plugin
[17:08:03] <ronson> yeah cool for phone number inputs
[17:08:07] <ronson> thats why im helping :P
[17:08:24] <MraAlbertina> ronson: for the circular one start point idea -> http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/       ----  + think of something like a safebox dial where the numbers are memorized on pause.
[17:08:25] <DavidSullivan> ronson, MraAlbertina  darn someones done it allready http://keith-wood.name/keypad.html
[17:09:04] <ronson> DavidSullivan: It isn't keyboard accessible
[17:09:08] <ronson> also uglers
[17:09:16] <MraAlbertina> the safebox would be a nice project too...
[17:09:50] <DavidSullivan> ronson, get rid of the buttons on the right and it would be ok
[17:10:03] <MraAlbertina> safebox dial. ppl would start using to input passwords, for instance, or munic codes, or... whatever
[17:10:10] <ronson> MraAlbertina: thats a cool project, the x cursor one looks decent
[17:10:19] <ronson> but it shouldnt be hard to do ourselves
[17:13:16] <guideX> is there any usual reason why when i .append, what I .appended isn't visible, but it is visible in the inspector in google chrome?
[17:13:21] <DavidSullivan> MraAlbertina, that knob one is pretty cool
[17:13:43] <MraAlbertina> ya, i like that too
[17:15:30] <DavidSullivan> ronson, you wanna work together and knock this out tonight as a plugin?
[17:16:45] <ronson> Sure.  Fork my pen and ill track your progress and we can both work side by side
[17:16:47] <MraAlbertina> hehehe
[17:16:50] <ronson> make something sexy
[17:17:12] <ronson> im going to be afk in a few but ill make one last change to it and let you know before i go
[17:18:10] <DavidSullivan> ronson, actualy that keypad one has a lot of nice features just ugly and not keyboard compliant
[17:19:42] <ronson> DavidSullivan: hm is it well coded?
[17:19:55] <DavidSullivan> havent looked at the code itself
[17:20:01] <DavidSullivan> http://keith-wood.name/keypad.html
[17:20:07] <ronson> thx
[17:20:14] <MraAlbertina> DavidSullivan: indeed, i were just noticing that too
[17:20:20] <DavidSullivan> got to the tryling and switch to one of the jquery ui themes
[17:21:41] <MraAlbertina> so what's the name you are going to give it?
[17:22:11] <MraAlbertina> Safe Dial? if you start with the theme 'safe knob'?
[17:22:38] <DavidSullivan> I am not great at css so I doubt I could make a dial one
[17:23:08] <MraAlbertina> i have plenty of ideas but no code skils to fill them up :)
[17:23:22] <nextime> well
[17:23:29] <tomasm-> why the hell does jquery-ui.css have to declare a color for "a" tags? that's cramping all my css that references 'a' alone
[17:23:31] <ronson> DavidSullivan: It's actually very well coded
[17:23:51] <nextime> this keypad is *exactly* what i need for a thing
[17:23:58] <nextime> thanks to make me discover it :)
[17:24:01] <ronson> :)
[17:24:24] <ronson> I guess we could make a round one then, CSS3 only
[17:24:33] <ronson> so no old browser support
[17:24:39] <ronson> unless you actually want this for production
[17:25:44] <DavidSullivan> only thing I dont like One popup keypad is shared by all instances, so this setting allows you to apply different CSS styling by adding an extra class to the keypad for each instance.
[17:25:46] <nextime> ronson : i want to use it in production, but in environments where i have full control on browsers or i can anyway count on recent and updated mobile browsers
[17:25:48] <nextime> :)
[17:27:04] <MraAlbertina> ronson: do what you feel comfortable with and ppl like and use it a lot, i don't care. it is indeed for production, i'm putting together a web radio site
[17:27:25] <coldhead> web radio, cool
[17:27:38] <DavidSullivan> oh so they can type in 97.1 and go to the radio statio?
[17:27:51] <MraAlbertina> lol
[17:28:20] <nextime> what i like is the randomized keypad
[17:28:48] <MraAlbertina> DavidSullivan: each news spot, music, article has a code - ppl listen to it and if they want to know more about it they dial de code
[17:29:01] <nextime> as i want to use it to insert pin codes on a tablet + jquerymobile gui for home automation
[17:29:07] <ronson> dialing to navigate is just a cool concept
[17:29:12] <nextime> (tablet and smartphone )
[17:29:20] <MraAlbertina> cool
[17:29:40] <DavidSullivan> ronson, yeah that whole clicking a link thing was just a fad anyway
[17:29:56] <ronson> Automated messages annoying you on the phone?  Please choose one of these 700 options on my website haha
[17:31:26] <nextime> an ivr web site: you enter, an <audio> tag spell something like "press 1 home, 2 for gallery, 3 for about, 4 for shop, 5 for privacy policy"
[17:31:26] <MraAlbertina> DavidSullivan: got the idea? someone is listening to some sort of news, scrolling or somewhere in the interface there is a code for the news spot. if someone dials that code goes to a more extensive article/news
[17:31:31] <nextime> and the popup the keypad
[17:31:33] <nextime> lol
[17:31:33] <nextime> :D
[17:32:43] <MraAlbertina> nextime: and press 0 to speak to an operator :P
[17:33:06] <coldhead> hahahahah
[17:33:20] <nextime> MraAlbertina : press 0 to send an email to the webmaster
[17:33:21] <nextime> :D
[17:34:06] <MraAlbertina> hehehe
[17:34:15] <MraAlbertina> nice one
[17:34:52] <DavidSullivan> this is pretty cool http://keith-wood.name/signature.html
[17:34:53] <nextime> anyway: /me loves jquerymobile 1.3.0
[17:35:17] <DavidSullivan> use this in a phone app to have customers sign for stuff
[17:35:21] <nextime> it is a lot better than the old one i was using right now, and has also some new very usefull things
[17:35:55] <nextime> my new smartphone/tablet gui will be a lot more user friendly
[17:53:41] <ipalaus> morning
[17:54:18] <ipalaus> I'm doing a $('div.video').mouseover(); and I dont know why but the event is executed two times… :\
[18:11:57] <MraAlbertina> ronson: i don't know if this could help in any way http://anthonyterrien.com/kontrol/
[18:13:46] <coldhead> hey DrShoggoth
[18:14:07] <coldhead> ?p @ ipalaus
[18:14:08] <guzzlefry> Hello
[18:14:08] <bot-t> ipalaus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:14:49] <guzzlefry> My book states that each() takes an annonymous function, but is there any reason I can't name the function and then pass it to each()?
[18:16:23] <coldhead> you sure can name it, guzzlefry !
[18:16:28] <coldhead> some people say that's best practice
[18:16:38] <coldhead> i don't generally because naming things is hard
[18:16:42] <coldhead> but if you have a good name, go nuts
[18:16:43] <guzzlefry> heh
[18:16:54] <guzzlefry> okay, wasn't sure why the book phrased it that way then.
[18:16:56] <coldhead> name one ater me
[18:17:04] <coldhead> it's conventionally anonymous
[18:17:06] <systemfault> can even name it in-place
[18:17:18] <coldhead> but it's more correct to say it can take a function, anonymous or otherwise
[18:17:55] <guzzlefry> ah I see, thank you
[18:18:02] <omarx9> any guys want a quick $50 bucks for fixing a jquery problem
[18:18:27] <omarx9> on this url: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position - it pretty much shows how to get the coordinates, where i am having trouble is, if coordinates = 0,0 then SHOW X, else Show Y
[18:21:42] <guzzlefry> omarx9: if-else statement? :P
[18:22:07] <omarx9> guzzlefry: i'm old, i onlyh learned vb3
[18:23:32] <coldhead> like this omarx9 http://jsfiddle.net/aG5BB/ ?
[18:24:42] <guideX> anyone ever worked with fineuploader? is it supposed to work with ipad?
[18:24:51] <guideX> I have it working everywhere except ipad :/
[18:25:00] <guideX> and probably iphone
[18:27:00] <ronson> I've worked with it, but never tested on those devices.
[18:27:06] <guideX> hmm i see
[18:27:07] <ronson> That thing is a b*~ to work with
[18:27:27] <guideX> fineuploader? I found it incredibly good to work with compared to the alternatives
[18:27:33] <guideX> it works really great actually
[18:27:56] <ronson> If you don't plan on modifying it too much, yes it does.
[18:28:30] <guideX> well all I added was some oncomplete stuff, I want to show thumbnails in my sites layout using isotope, worked great
[18:28:44] <guideX> I also changed the css a lot to make it look like my site/colors
[18:29:18] <ipalaus> i'm looking for a plugin that rotates an image. I've a group of thumbnails and when someone hovers and image I want to loop em… any idea? thanks in advance!

[18:42:14] <hateIE> I want a selector to select the img that is before the a
[18:44:13] <guzzlefry> $("#img").before('a') I think >_>
[18:45:08] <guzzlefry> not really a selector as much as it is as function to pull the object. And that may not work. I have a total of 50 minutes experience with JQuery so far. :)
[18:45:08] <jrockjiggz2> I have an ajax event with callback in the success function.  I want to use $(document).ajaxComplete() to perform application wide js, but i'm finding ajaxSuccess() will fire before the callback.  I've tried ajaxStop() and no luck either

[18:47:02] <bambanx> hi
[18:47:39] <Ghost1227> I'm trying to trigger a function on field change and it works for input, textarea, and select, but jQuery('hidden').change(function() {}); doesn't work. any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong?
[18:48:23] <jrockjiggz2> what is changing?
[18:48:35] <coldhead> Ghost1227: that seems to be selecting <hidden></hidden>
[18:48:39] <coldhead> i don't think that's a thing
[18:49:39] <bambanx> guys my project failed i need make a slider of images with 200 images , i used edge animate and fail , can u suggest me any plugin or some for do this, im just reading lazy load plugin
[18:50:31] <Ghost1227> doh
[18:50:38] <Ghost1227> good point coldhead
[18:51:02] <Ghost1227> it's input type="hidden" not hidden >_<
[18:52:08] <guzzlefry> so, $('a + img') is to $('a ~ img') as $('ul > li') is to $('ul li')? As least as far as the latter selectors only check that the element is immediately after?
[18:52:17] <bambanx> hey coldhead
[18:52:33] * guzzlefry wonders if that made any sense at all. :)
[18:53:36] <Ghost1227> that changes the parameters of the question. why does it not trigger when defined as 'input' and a input of type hidden is changed?
[18:53:45] <jrockjiggz2> guzzlefry: not exactly

[18:58:40] <sheilablackrose> hi guys
[18:58:43] <sheilablackrose> been a while
[19:05:02] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone take a look at this. i just want the checkbox that is currently being set to change the attribute
[19:11:32] <hariom> When I submit a form, I see "Submit Query" text showing on the screen for 1 or 2 seconds. How to remove that text. I haven't written that anywhere
[19:12:44] <lanken> I've got a situation where a div is holding some UI controls which are drawn onto a <canvas>
[19:13:20] <lanken> the controls are a radial menu, so, a circle
[19:13:49] <lanken> the div was intercepting click events around the periphery, where the corners are
[19:14:17] <lanken> so I set it to css "pointer-events:none;"
[19:14:37] <lanken> but this causes clicks to also fall through the radial menu
[19:15:20] <lanken> I am hoping that jquery can "catch" the clicks onto the div, process them if they hit the radial menu, and pass them down to the next layer if not
[19:16:45] <lanken> hmm, I guess it's "$(document.elementFromPoint(x, y)).click();  "
[19:17:09] <lanken> but I would probably have to move the intervening div out of the way first, that's annoying.
[19:18:09] <lanken> I take it back, obviously I would have to do that, unless jquery had some kind of built-in click-through option..I wonder if this comes with jquery UI?
[19:23:38] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone take a look at this. i just want the checkbox that is currently being set to change the attribute http://jsfiddle.net/AdQFG/5/
[19:31:10] <DavidSullivan> sheilablackrose, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/AdQFG/6/
[19:35:31] <DavidSullivan> sheilablackrose, there is also toggleclass http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/AdQFG/7/
[19:40:13] <hariom> When I submit a form, I see "Submit Query" text showing on the screen for 1 or 2 seconds. How to remove that text. I haven't written that anywhere. How to remove this text?
[19:45:16] <DavidSullivan> are u using some kind of form submission plugin?
[19:45:31] <DavidSullivan> hariom, ^^
[19:48:23] <sheilablackrose> DavidSullivan hi thanks sorry for the late reply
[19:48:34] <sheilablackrose> but is there away to change the class it self
[19:48:40] <sheilablackrose> cuz the checkbox also has a background
[19:48:48] <sheilablackrose> so the hwole checkbox is an image
[19:49:14] <DavidSullivan> sheilablackrose, the 2nd example
[19:49:33] <DavidSullivan> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/AdQFG/8/
[19:50:08] <sheilablackrose> ill paste the whole code give me a sec.
[19:52:13] <sheilablackrose> DavidSullivan: http://jsfiddle.net/AdQFG/9/   but it wont work as the image is not there. so basically there currently 3 state to the checkbox, checked uncheck n indeterminate. all has it own image n color.
[19:52:29] <sheilablackrose> so on the checkbox that is recently checked will have a diff colour all together
[19:52:30] <hariom> DavidSullivan: no
[19:54:53] <hariom> DavidSullivan: I have check all files using: find * -name "*.*"|xargs grep ' type="submit" ' | grep -v value    but I didn't find any type="submit" where value is not defined
[19:55:17] <DavidSullivan> sheilablackrose, http://shamsmi.blogspot.com/2008/12/tri-state-checkbox-using-javascript.html
[19:55:23] <goddard> how can i get a specific class for something that was clicked
[19:55:47] <goddard> so like $(this).$('.myclass')
[19:55:48] <goddard> ?
[19:56:10] <DavidSullivan> goddard, $(this).class() will return all the classes
[19:56:26] <goddard> DavidSullivan, i can't pick one ?
[19:56:53] <DavidSullivan> goddard, what do you want to do with it once you have it
[19:57:14] <goddard> DavidSullivan, change some text inside it
[19:57:27] <DavidSullivan> ?removeclass
[19:57:28] <bot-t> .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[19:57:48] <Forbidd3n> I have the plugin included, .validate(...); but the form submits anyways
[19:57:54] <DavidSullivan> goddard, there is also see ?toggleclass
[19:57:54] <bot-t> goddard, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[19:57:58] <Forbidd3n> even though rules are not met
[19:58:14] <Forbidd3n> does validate automatically return false on submit or do you have to do that in jquery?
[19:58:27] <sheilablackrose> DavidSullivan: the code i have works when i do $('.tagCheckbox + label').css('color','blue');  it works but it changes every checkbox. i need something along the lines of $(this).$('.tagCheckbox + label').css('color','blue');
[19:58:30] <sheilablackrose> is that possible?
[19:59:20] <DavidSullivan> sheilablackrose, the best way would be to have the label have a class called something like labelForID
[20:00:28] <DavidSullivan> var chID = this.id;  $('.labelFor' + chID).css or .class or whatver
[20:01:20] <DavidSullivan> or do $('[for="' + this.id + '"]').whatever
[20:01:35] <DavidSullivan> but using the attribute selector is a lot slower
[20:02:28] <DavidSullivan> sheilablackrose, or are you trying to change the checkbox when the label is clicked
[20:02:48] <DavidSullivan> gotta go get the wifey
[20:03:31] <hariom> Is there a way to capture a particular string and its DOM when displaying on the screen while page loads? There is a particular string coming up on the screen but I am not able to locate where is that and the page is heavily nested not a single file
[20:03:47] <sheilablackrose> ic
[20:03:49] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[20:04:04] <sheilablackrose> yup when the label is clicked
[20:04:07] <sheilablackrose> basically is like this
[20:04:13] <sheilablackrose> all the checkbox are dynamic
[20:04:29] <sheilablackrose> when loaded the onw that are checkd have diff image n color
[20:04:36] <sheilablackrose> the indeterminate diff image n color
[20:04:41] <sheilablackrose> n the uncheked diff image n color
[20:04:57] <sheilablackrose> so when u check a new checkbox it will have the color that is specifed in jqury
[20:05:12] <sheilablackrose> but when loaded again it will take the value that is set in the css
[20:05:41] <Forbidd3n> anyone on the validate question?
[20:06:47] <hariom> Is there a way to capture a particular string and its DOM when displaying on the screen while page loads? There is a particular string coming up on the screen but I am not able to locate where is that and the page is heavily nested not a single file
[20:30:48] <hariom> Is there a way to capture a particular string and its DOM when displaying on the screen while page loads? There is a particular string coming up on the screen but I am not able to locate where is that and the page is heavily nested not a single file
[20:31:03] <hariom> or after page load?
[20:33:08] <coldhead> hariom: you can assign a "break on subtree mofication" breakpoint to a parent element
[20:33:14] <coldhead> in chrome web inspector
[20:33:20] <coldhead> i can't think of another way
[20:34:41] <hariom> coldhead: "Submit Query" string is appearing on the page when a page is submitted. From where is this originating is what I want to know so that I can remove it. Some have suggested that if there is no 'value' attribute on input type 'submit' this will appear but I don't have any submit without value attribute.
[20:45:01] <sheilablackrose> cn anyone send me a link for browser detection?
[20:45:44] <Forbidd3n> why does - highlight: function(element) { $(element).wrap('<span class="error" />'); }, - wrap the element and then wrap the wrap of the element - basically wrapping twice
[20:46:28] <getschomp545> does anybody know how to integrate parallax scrollign?
[20:48:07] <coldhead> hariom: something is probably adding that submit button then
[20:48:46] <gf3> Submit buttons are included in the form post data
[20:48:53] <gf3> Er
[20:48:55] <gf3> Form data
[20:49:05] <coldhead> hariom: i would try to nuke it with CSS: #someparent input {font-size: 0/0}
[20:49:35] <gf3> coldhead: You need the fake font, non?
[20:49:38] <gf3> font: 0/0 x
[20:50:11] <coldhead> yeah look i've never ever done that in my life
[20:50:15] <coldhead> i saw it on a slide one time
[20:50:19] <hariom> coldhead: Is it possible to make font size 0 for input type submit?
[20:50:23] <coldhead> i didn't understand then and i don't care now
[20:50:24] <hariom> only
[20:50:36] <gf3> coldhead: I'm tired of life
[20:50:38] <coldhead> hariom: i don't think you can just select that one
[20:50:56] <coldhead> i'd give all the others a class and then do #something input.someclass {font-size: whatever}
[20:51:09] <coldhead> and the one without the class gets special general attention
[20:51:43] <gf3> JUST LIKE MY EX
[20:52:49] <coldhead> sad story boss
[20:52:50] <systemfault> hariom: add overflow: hidden and text-indent: -9999em; on it if you want to hide the text.
[20:53:58] <gf3> font: 0/0 x; color: transparent;
[20:54:17] <hariom> systemfault: the problem is I don't know from where it is coming. Most probably its due to not having value= attribute on some input submit element. There are hundreds of that as I have wordpress plugins integrated
[20:56:28] <gf3> hariom: You could select all submit inputs that don't have a value
[20:57:29] <hariom> gf3: And then place value="" for all of them. A good thing but doing it manually will be too much work
[21:00:35] <JBlitzen> Is it okay to add a jquery script block inside the body of an HTML page?
[21:00:53] <JBlitzen> I'm trying to find the specific rules about that if there are any
[21:01:00] <gf3> JBlitzen: Of course
[21:01:16] <gf3> JBlitzen: I usually do all my javascript-ing just before the end of the body
[21:01:27] <Forbidd3n> why does - highlight: function(element) { $(element).wrap('<span class="error" />'); }, - wrap the element and then wrap the wrap of the element - basically wrapping twice using jquery validate
[21:01:28] <JBlitzen> So if I have a datepicker input thing, I can put the script block which sets its stuff right before the input tag itself?
[21:01:40] <JBlitzen> <script> ... </script><input id="datepicker"> ?
[21:01:43] <gf3> JBlitzen: Right *after*
[21:01:48] <JBlitzen> Mm
[21:01:55] <JBlitzen> Critical nuance, ty
[21:01:57] <gf3> JBlitzen: You want the element to exist before you try and find it
[21:02:02] <JBlitzen> Gotcha
[21:05:42] <JBlitzen> Not getting called at all
[21:05:44] <JBlitzen> Fucking wordpress
[21:05:50] <JBlitzen> jquery evidently not loaded
[21:05:56] <JBlitzen> So much for wp_enqueue_script
[21:06:12] <gf3> MORE LKE WORSTPRESS
[21:06:39] <JBlitzen> Oh
[21:06:41] <JBlitzen> Wait
[21:06:53] <JBlitzen> I have to specify the type of script, don't I, not just use <script>
[21:07:36] <guzzlefry> Wordstress
[21:07:49] <guzzlefry> meh...that one wasn't that good :P
[21:08:15] <gf3> JBlitzen: You do not
[21:08:26] <gf3> JBlitzen: <script> is acceptable for HTML5
[21:09:36] <JBlitzen> Does anything actually use HTML 5
[21:10:35] <gf3> JBlitzen: Yeah, man
[21:10:59] <JBlitzen> Well, IE 9 doesn't
[21:11:11] <JBlitzen> In any event, I still can't get this thing to recognize
[21:11:17] <guzzlefry> It doesn't?
[21:11:27] <JBlitzen> It does?
[21:12:03] <JBlitzen> Is HTML 5 even finalized yet?
[21:12:07] <guzzlefry> no
[21:12:10] <Forbidd3n> anyone that can look at this validate - when you click submit it is wrapping the element into 2 span tags - http://jsfiddle.net/ucEfM/
[21:12:19] <guzzlefry> but most browsers have implemented the draft portions
[21:12:33] <JBlitzen> IE 9 just scored a 138 out of 500
[21:12:38] <JBlitzen> In HTML 5 support
[21:12:46] <JBlitzen> So, yeah, let's discuss that
[21:12:50] <guzzlefry> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/hh410106.aspx
[21:13:32] <guzzlefry> JBlitzen: what test are you running?
[21:13:50] <Forbidd3n> update jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/ucEfM/1/
[21:14:10] <JBlitzen> http://html5test.com/
[21:14:56] <gf3> It's kind of a BS test
[21:21:05] <Forbidd3n> anyone that can help with the .wrap twice, please?
[21:22:03] <sheilablackrose> if i write a msg on jquery how do i display it on a div? can i use a span?
[21:30:55] <Forbidd3n> uggh
[21:31:06] <Forbidd3n> why the hell is it wrapping twice on highlight
[21:42:50] <Qbix1> hey guys
[21:42:54] <Qbix1> does John Resig sometimes come here?
[21:43:37] <grafi> [01:03:13] <Qbix1> does John Resig ever come in here?
[21:43:37] <grafi> [01:03:21] <coldhead> not lately
[21:45:40] <amh345> whats the best method to prevent someone for rapidly clicking a button that sends requets to the server over andover again?
[21:45:54] <amh345> button, div, submit form etc
[21:46:21] <Qbix1> ah okay
[21:46:35] <Qbix1> sorry I asked the other thing here too, but somehow the logs have disappeared and I never saw the answer:
[21:46:40] <Qbix1> right now you have $.extend and other functions call isPlainObject, which does some magic with blacklists, by trying to make sure what an object is NOT
[21:46:45] <Qbix1> instead, you can simply have isPlainObject call Object.prototype.toString.apply(obj) === '[Object object]' and poof!
[21:46:50] <Qbix1> in any case, it would make jQuery code a lot simpler
[21:46:55] <Qbix1> did anyone answer that one?
[21:48:39] <dcherman> Qbix1: Object.prototype.toString.call( (new function f() {}) ).  that's not a plain object.
[21:49:54] <Qbix1> >> Object.prototype.toString.call( (new function f() {}) )
[21:50:44] <Qbix1> why not? It creates a new object using constructor f
[21:51:28] <dcherman> that's not a plain object per the documentation for the function.
[21:51:43] <Qbix1> where is the documentation of the function
[21:51:58] <Qbix1>  (created using "{}" or "new Object"). ?
[21:52:27] <Qbix1> Why is that definition of plainness there? It seems to me that an object created with new Constructor() is also a plain object
[21:52:47] <Qbix1> the reason jQuery tests for plain objects is so that they can deep-extend them, etc.
[21:53:10] <Qbix1> but regardless, if you want to exclude objects like the one you mentioned, just check the prototype.constructor property
[21:53:10] <gf3> js> print(Object.prototype.toString.call( (new function f() {}) ))
[21:53:13] <b-ot> gf3: [object Object]
[21:53:16] <gf3> NAICE
[21:53:27] <Qbix1> that's supposed to be that way
[21:53:43] <Qbix1> that IS an object
[21:53:55] <Qbix1> jquery should be happy to extend it, why not
[21:53:57] <gf3> `mlu @ Qbix1
[21:53:57] <b-ot> Qbix1: much like urself
[21:54:09] <Qbix1> ?
[21:54:51] <amh345> is .bind .unbind the preferred method for stopping rapid clicks on a div/form/etc?
[21:55:06] <Qbix1> Object.prototype.toString.apply(obj) === '[Object object]' && obj.prototype.constructor === 'Object'
[21:55:43] <Qbix1> js> print((new function f() {}).prototype.constructor)
[21:55:46] <b-ot> Qbix1: No output.
[21:56:15] <Qbix1> js > print ( {}.prototype.constructor )
[21:56:31] <Qbix1> js> print ( {}.prototype.constructor )
[21:56:33] <b-ot> Qbix1: No output.
[21:56:34] <gf3> Ideone is pretty limited
[21:56:46] <gf3> `eval “wat"
[21:56:51] <gf3> Yeahhhh
[21:57:57] <Qbix1> how is ideone > codepad
[21:58:06] <Qbix1> or geordi
[22:14:09] <ntgcsa> Could somebody please help me integrate some jquery into wordpress? I'm getting this in my console:  jQuery is not defined
[22:14:34] <yefim323> you aren't adding the script tag correctly maybe
[22:15:23] <ntgcsa> yefim323: I'm adding it like this: <script type="text/javascript" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/js/ntgcsaa.js"></script>
[22:15:57] <ntgcsa> It is loading the file, its just not executing.
[22:15:59] <yefim323> are you adding jquery in a script tag above that?
[22:16:05] <Taggnostr> I have <ul><li>some text<ul><li>...</li></ul></li></ul>, how can I select 'some text' (i.e. the first textnode of the li)?
[22:16:25] <yefim323> $('ul li:first')
[22:17:16] <ntgcsa> yefim323: No, jquery comes in wordpress. If I specifically add it then I can get it to work, but having two instances of jquery breaks my plugins.
[22:17:41] <yefim323> why do you need two instances of jquery?
[22:19:08] <Taggnostr> yefim323, that seems to select only the first li, not the textnode
[22:19:18] <ntgcsa> I don't, but when I add a script line above it with jquery.min.js, its loading a second instance, as wordpress has already loaded one. So no I don't have a script tag above it, but jquery is being loaded (I think).
[22:19:39] <systemfault> Taggnostr: Nobody works with textnodes…. and jquery doesn't
[22:19:45] <yefim323> $('ul li:first').text()
[22:19:56] <systemfault> Taggnostr: What do you want to do with that text?
[22:20:26] <yefim323> open a javascript console and run $.fn.jquery
[22:20:39] <Taggnostr> .text() also returns the text in the inner ul
[22:20:45] <yefim323> yes
[22:21:40] <Taggnostr> systemfault, before I had the text wrapped in a p, and I was doing $('li p'), but now I found out that adding all the <p> takes 5s (the page takes 10s to load overall), so I removed them and I'm trying to figure out how to still get that text
[22:21:41] <Cork> Taggnostr: dom don't really have a way to select on text nodes
[22:22:07] <Taggnostr> can't I do something like children[0]?
[22:22:22] <yefim323> $('ul').children()[0]
[22:22:30] <Cork> wait 5s to add a p element??
[22:22:39] <yefim323> apparently
[22:22:46] <Cork> and no that will still just get you the li
[22:22:47] <Taggnostr> it's a long list, so hundred of <p>
[22:22:48] <ntgcsa> yefim323: I get: $ is undefined, but when I look in firebug I see the jquery script.
[22:23:09] <yefim323> it's not loading correctly
[22:23:09] <Cork> Taggnostr: html expects you to have elements when you want to do things
[22:23:20] <Cork> Taggnostr: though p elements inside li elements isn't valid
[22:23:31] <Cork> do you get same problem if you add a span?
[22:23:51] <ntgcsa> yefim323: How can I find the problem?
[22:23:57] <Taggnostr> let me try
[22:24:13] <yefim323> ntgcsa, I don't know :/
[22:24:31] <ntgcsa> yefim323: If I give you a link could you take a look?
[22:25:10] <yefim323> umm sure
[22:25:12] <yefim323> msg me
[22:25:29] <Taggnostr> firefox crashed :)
[22:25:32] <yefim323> wooo
[22:25:39] <yefim323> why is your page so big?
[22:25:50] <Cork> O_o
[22:26:08] <ntgcsa> \mSg: yefim323 Hello
[22:26:12] <Cork> what the heck are you doing...
[22:26:22] <yefim323> ...
[22:26:27] <yefim323> it's /msg
[22:26:34] <Taggnostr> I have half MB of data in json, and I'm listing them and have a form at the top to filter them
[22:26:42] <yefim323> right, Cork?
[22:26:54] <Cork> yefim323: my comment was for Taggnostr
[22:27:12] <ntgcsa> I know, I'm on the webchat, I typed /m <tab> and somehow autocompleted to that...
[22:27:27] <Cork> Taggnostr: possibly you shouldn't add all the elements to the dom from the start
[22:27:43] <yefim323> ntgcsa, I'm going to bed, sorry. Can't fix
[22:27:43] <coldhead> yes well nobody is perfect
[22:27:46] <ntgcsa> yefim323: Maybe you can't pm on webchat?
[22:27:53] <Cork> Taggnostr: and only add the visible elements instead
[22:28:04] <Cork> and when its filtered replace the list
[22:28:25] <Taggnostr> with spans it runs in 8.5s apparently
[22:28:36] <Cork> compared to?
[22:28:40] <Taggnostr> Cork, I was considering that
[22:28:41] <systemfault> Taggnostr: What is your loop?
[22:28:55] <Taggnostr> 5.5 without anything, 10.5 with the <p>
[22:29:00] <systemfault> If you're doing millions of useless reflows.. it's going to be slow.
[22:29:11] <Cork> Taggnostr: how are you adding the span element?
[22:29:13] <Taggnostr> http://wolfprojects.altervista.org/issues.html
[22:29:24] <Taggnostr> here's the page, the js is inlined
[22:30:03] <Cork> Taggnostr: build an html string and append it all in one go to the parent
[22:30:14] <Cork> line 22 - 34
[22:30:29] <Taggnostr> ok, let me try
[22:30:47] <Cork> recommended is to use an array and then join(''); it
[22:31:30] <systemfault> Reflow problems :P
[22:32:52] <Cork> systemfault: you shouldn't get reflow from an unattached element
[22:33:04] <Cork> its just slowness in adding dom elements
[22:33:30] <systemfault> Cork: ul#content is attache..
[22:33:36] <Cork> ah, true
[22:33:43] <systemfault> So for every file… you get a useless reflow.
[22:33:54] <Cork> so it reflows once each turn in the each loop
[22:33:57] <Cork> ya
[22:34:29] <systemfault> jquery says that his list has 8525 <li>s…
[22:34:33] <systemfault> A lot of reflows :P
[22:34:41] <Cork> :)
[22:38:29] <Taggnostr> 2.6s
[22:38:35] <Cork> :)
[22:38:46] <Cork> are you still appdending to the ul?
[22:38:57] <Cork> or do you do that after the loop?
[22:39:08] <Cork> (all li's in one go)
[22:39:14] <goddard> my button set has some links that I want the page to go to but it just hides the menu and nothing happens
[22:39:26] <goddard> how can i make the windows go to the page of my menu item
[22:39:28] <Taggnostr> yes, still appending to ul#content in the .each()
[22:39:44] <Taggnostr> do you think I should do it outside?
[22:39:48] <Cork> yes
[22:39:53] <Cork> it triggers reflow
[22:40:14] <Cork> you want to trigger reflow as few times as possible
[22:40:20] <Cork> cause thats expensive
[22:40:50] <Cork> (the browser basically loops over all elements in the dom, and calculates there new dimensions)
[22:41:07] <systemfault> Taggnostr: You could clone $('ul#content')… fill it out of DOM with with loop with replace the old one with the clone
[22:41:09] <Taggnostr> 1.2s :)
[22:41:15] <systemfault> Ah :D
[22:41:19] <systemfault> You got it with a string
[22:41:20] <Cork> systemfault: not needed
[22:41:23] <systemfault> Good
[22:41:36] <Cork> Taggnostr: and there you have the span now :)
[22:41:47] <Cork> and its 4x faster too !
[22:43:09] <Taggnostr> yep, thanks!
[22:43:18] <Taggnostr> can the search be improved too?
[22:43:48] <Taggnostr> currently I get the text in the span, .test() it with a regex, and then call .show() or .hide()
[22:44:48] <goddard> you see here
[22:44:49] <goddard> http://jqueryui.com/button/#splitbutton
[22:44:55] <goddard> my links don't work
[22:44:56] <kostodo> Hello there: Trying to centre an imagine in a fixed sized div - http://jsfiddle.net/myntk/2/
[22:45:01] <goddard> yoyo
[22:45:30] <Cork> Taggnostr: $('#content > li').show().filter(function() { return query.test($(this).find('span').text()); }).hide()
[22:45:44] <kostodo> My code is working fine but I also have media queries set up on the page and if you were to resize the window quickly it seems that $('body').width() gets confused
[22:45:52] <kostodo> when the media query shuffles the CSS
[22:45:56] <Cork> Taggnostr: not sure that becomes faster though
[22:46:09] <Cork> it depends on jquery a bit
[22:46:19] <kostodo> or maybe thats not the issue, but definitely when i resize the window quickly across the media query step i end up with a white space on the right hand side of my image
[22:46:25] <kostodo> not possible to see thats on jsfiddle tho
[22:46:37] <Cork> opps
[22:46:45] <Cork> Taggnostr: meant $('#content > li').show().filter(function() { return !query.test($(this).find('span').text()); }).hide()
[22:47:57] <Taggnostr> Cork, given that there are usually few matches, wouldn't the opposite be more efficient? (i.e. hide them all and then show the ones that match)
[22:48:16] <Taggnostr> can I do .hide().filter(...).show()?
[22:48:22] <Cork> Taggnostr: its just setting a css value
[22:48:37] <Cork> but ya, that should work too
[22:48:59] <Cork> Taggnostr: a way to make it faster would be to base it on a class instead
[22:49:42] <Cork> $('.hide').removeClass('hide'); $().filter(...).addClass('hide');
[22:50:16] <Taggnostr> 3.8s -> 1.5s using the method you suggested with hide() first and show() later
[22:50:18] <gf3> BASS it on a class
[22:50:22] <gf3> UNCE UNCE UNCE
[22:51:01] <Taggnostr> Cork, I think this should be fast enough (at least for now)
[22:51:06] <Taggnostr> thanks again for the help!
[22:51:07] * Cork nods
[22:51:10] <Cork> np
[22:51:59] <gf3> Okay, ignore my amazing joke
[22:52:01] <gf3> Dicks
[22:52:50] <kostodo> Cork: any idea on my problem here: http://jsfiddle.net/myntk/3/
[22:53:07] <Cork> and that is?
[22:54:20] <kostodo> Im trying to centre an image inside a fixed height div
[22:54:52] <kostodo> And the code on jsfiddle is working well as you can see if you resize the isndow
[22:54:56] <kostodo> window*
[22:55:03] <Cork> why not just set the image as background-image?
[22:55:13] <kostodo> no possible
[22:55:13] <Cork> then you don't need js at all
[22:55:18] <Cork> why?
[22:55:27] <kostodo> its dynamically generated from a CMS
[22:55:32] <Cork> so?
[22:55:38] <Cork> ah the img tag is?
[22:55:41] <kostodo> yes
[22:55:53] * Cork just got a flashback of the pain called cms...
[22:55:58] <Taggnostr> kostodo, can't you use something like http://reisio.com/examples/deadcenter/ ?
[22:56:11] <Cork> should be doable
[22:56:21] <kostodo> Listen my code is working well
[22:56:23] <Cork> and ya that is the second best alternative
[22:56:38] <ProLoser> what's the best way to toString a dom element?
[22:56:40] <ProLoser> for debugging
[22:56:46] <Cork> kostodo: except that you depend on js for layout
[22:56:47] <kostodo> but I am also using media queries to switch layouts depending on screen resolution
[22:56:52] <ProLoser> i want to throw an error but i want to identify what DOM element it was on
[22:57:22] <Taggnostr> kostodo, that sounds like one more reason to do it with pure css to me :)
[22:57:25] <Cork> ProLoser:  $('<div/>').html($(elm).clone()).html()
[22:57:27] <kostodo> and it seems that when the media query fires (i.e. if you resize the window across the media query it loses the BODY.width() i think
[22:57:39] <ProLoser> Cork: seriously?
[22:57:50] <ProLoser> why am i cloning?
[22:58:00] <Cork> else you remove the element from the dom
[22:58:30] <ProLoser> what? .html() doesn't remove from dom
[22:58:31] <kostodo> Taggnostr: I doubt this problem is solvable by css. The image size is responsive. width: 100%, height: auto
[22:59:02] <Cork> ProLoser: $('<div/>') creates a div ..html($(elm)) appends the element to the div
[22:59:09] <Cork> aka, removes it from the original position
[22:59:16] <Cork> .html() serializes the content of the div
[22:59:24] <Cork> === the original element is removed
[22:59:58] <kostodo> Cork: any idea why $('body').width() might be calculating slow? or a better way to get viewport width?
[23:00:10] <kostodo> "page" width
[23:00:16] <Cork> body is the width of the content
[23:00:25] <Cork> you most likely want $(window).width()
[23:01:11] <kostodo> I get the same issue
[23:01:20] <kostodo> with $(window).width()
[23:01:29] <Cork> or possibly document.documentElement.clientWidth
[23:01:44] <kostodo> maybe its the img.width() and img.height() which are being calculated slowly
[23:02:18] <Cork> kostodo: javascript is triggered with intervals so you will always lag
[23:02:27] <Cork> thats the cost of doing it through js
[23:02:40] <Cork> and is another reason why you should do it through css
[23:02:55] <kostodo> you think that problem is solvable through CSS?
[23:02:58] <kostodo> I would absolutely LOVE to see that
[23:02:59] <Cork> yes
[23:03:28] <Cork> ex. with max-width and margin: auto;
[23:03:42] <Cork> or min-width; and margin: auto; of you prefer that solution
[23:03:47] <Cork> depending on what you want
[23:04:08] <Cork> of==if
[23:04:43] <kostodo> Cork, can you update the fiddle to show me what you mean please?
[23:04:47] <kostodo> feel free to remove the JS
[23:05:05] <Cork> how do you want to center the image?
[23:05:14] <kostodo> i want to show the exact centre of the image
[23:05:22] <Cork> so it crops or if its too small that its centered with borders?
[23:05:25] <kostodo> so i want clipping to be down on all sides
[23:05:28] <Cork> ok so cropping
[23:08:59] <kostodo> Cork?
[23:09:28] <gf3> http://jsfiddle.net/hE888/
[23:10:21] <gf3> Nope
[23:11:14] <gf3> kostodo: Do you know the image size?
[23:11:20] <kostodo> nope
[23:13:12] <kostodo> Cork, did your idea work?
[23:15:01] <kostodo> BTW: this is a working JS solution: http://jsfiddle.net/myntk/3/
[23:15:23] <kostodo> But bugs a little when there is quickly resizing across media queries
[23:15:42] <kostodo> Would love to be proved otherwise and shown a CSS -only solution
[23:20:18] <Cork> kostodo: http://jsfiddle.net/myntk/6/
[23:20:28] <Cork> thats what i have time to fiddle together right now
[23:20:45] <Cork> it is possible to make it more dynamic, but i fail to remember it right now >_<
[23:21:00] <Cork> (and i'm at work so i can't place more time on it then this)
[23:21:13] <kostodo> its stretching the image
[23:21:22] <kostodo> aspect ratio is changing
[23:21:34] <Cork> kostodo: min-width: 1280px; <--
[23:21:36] <kostodo> unfortunately not the same result as the js one
[23:21:41] <Cork> i suspect at least
[23:21:55] <Cork> kostodo: if you want more help try asking in #css
[23:21:59] <Cork> it IS doable
[23:22:08] <kostodo> DON'T believe you ;)
[23:22:16] <Cork> i've done it, so i know it is
[23:23:58] <kostodo> Cork: thanks anyway
[23:24:09] <Cork> np
[23:34:29] <gf3> kostodo: It would be easier (and more performant) to copy the image’s src and use that as a background image
[23:34:35] <gf3> kostodo: Then hide the image element
[23:35:14] <kostodo> Unfortunately not possible in this case.
[23:35:14] <kostodo> As per the specs
[23:36:09] <noregret> does anyone use https://github.com/infusion/jQuery-paging ? i'm facing a bug and wondering if it's teh same everywhere
[23:39:15] <the_dark_knight> Hi, This is how my js method to delete feedback looks like - http://www.bpaste.net/show/sbxe3jhXevOMbAj2kRSk/. My controller and model methods are here- http://www.bpaste.net/show/6XPSbIGPdplYp4GmBJOe/ . As you can see I am not returning anything from model to controller and from controller to jquery. So in jquery when I print data with alert, it is empty. In jquery I want to be sure that this record with id is deleted and then I want to remove t
[23:42:31] <guzzlefry> Is it common practice to have many $(document).ready(); calls?
[23:42:38] <gf3> No
[23:47:54] <XtremeWiz> Hi everyone, how can I check whether a link returns 404 using jquery?
[23:48:21] <gf3> XtremeWiz: See HTTP HEAD requests
[23:54:02] <XtremeWiz> gf3: It's a link in another website, not mine. Will it work?
