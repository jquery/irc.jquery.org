[00:00:11] <tw2113> and no, not one that offers unique urls like you showed earlier
[00:00:19] <yen_> hmm//
[00:00:29] <yen_> but i need something that will work in wp
[00:00:33] <tw2113> i tested this with this one personally http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[00:00:39] <tw2113> i know what you need it in
[00:00:46] <tw2113> i also know this would be agnostic
[00:01:41] <tw2113> anyways
[00:01:56] <yen_> is it free?
[00:01:56] <yen_> the plugin?
[00:02:12] <tw2113> that slider specifically, has this for a callback api:          after: function(){}, //Callback: function(slider) - Fires after each slider animation completes
[00:02:28] <tw2113> aka each time the slide changes
[00:02:29] <tw2113> yes on free
[00:02:49] <yen_> sweeeeeeet
[00:03:15] <tw2113> now, this isn't tested at all, because i don't use google analytics, and the results wouldn't necessarily show up right away
[00:03:32] <tw2113> after: function(slider){ var img = $(slider).find('.flex-active-slide img').attr('src'); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', img]); }
[00:03:33] <yen_> yeah but thats why its a challenge for all of us!
[00:04:02] <tw2113> use the after: part, create an anonymous function, pass in the slider event, just like their demo shows
[00:04:29] <tw2113> inside the function, use a touch of jQuery to descend into the slider variable
[00:04:59] <tw2113> $(slider).find('.flex-active-slide img') <----finds the image of the currently active slide
[00:05:22] <tw2113> .attr('src');
[00:05:36] <tw2113> retrieve the src attribute of that current image
[00:05:45] <tw2113> all gets assigned into a variable of "img"
[00:06:03] <yen_> that sounds pretty awesome and accurate. hope it does work
[00:06:18] <tw2113> then, after that is created, pass that into the _gaq.push() and it should be triggered for the specific image
[00:06:21] <yen_> so are  u saying that each image will be a new page view like this?
[00:06:35] <tw2113> because the function gets called every time the slide changes
[00:06:47] <yen_> hmmm...but thenentire page does not re-load?
[00:06:52] <tw2113> no need
[00:07:29] <yen_> so it kinda loads the into an iframe
[00:07:34] <tw2113> i had console.log(img) in my test setup and watched firebug
[00:07:40] <yen_> not literally but the same idea.
[00:07:43] <tw2113> each time it was different, other than repeating every 4 slides
[00:08:26] <yen_> sorry i mean, so its kinda loads each image in an iframe -- and therefore counts as a page view...
[00:08:35] <yen_> somehting along those lines ?
[00:08:37] <tw2113> <ul class="slides" style="width: 1200%; transition-duration: 0.6s; transform: translate3d(-1548px, 0px, 0px);">
[00:08:43] <tw2113> huge ass width
[00:09:13] <tw2113> think of what you see as the image, being a window and something just moving images back and forth
[00:09:33] <tw2113> shitty explanation right there
[00:09:47] <ivankuzev> yeah i have a carousel for that :)...
[00:09:49] <yen_> all sounds awesome in theory.
[00:09:53] <ivankuzev> let me dig up the url
[00:10:01] <yen_> i wonder if we can actually do this.
[00:10:10] <tw2113> i did without testing
[00:10:20] <yen_> got somethnig to share?
[00:10:28] <tw2113> already explained it all above
[00:11:03] <yen_> shall i download flexslider?
[00:11:10] <tw2113> \if you want
[00:11:18] <tw2113> i dunno your schedule :D
[00:11:30] <yen_> i am a slave :(
[00:11:40] <tw2113> the man has many
[00:11:51] <yen_> hmm..
[00:11:53] <yen_> true
[00:12:23] <yen_> is ivankuzev suggesting another slider?
[00:12:31] <ivankuzev> http://del3.kaprizbg.com/carousel/demos
[00:12:42] <ivankuzev> not really ..i just wanted to show one i made
[00:12:51] <yen_> ok sweet let me chec
[00:13:40] <yen_> v cool
[00:13:52] <yen_> it's sorta like those scroll content boxes that news sites have..
[00:14:10] <yen_> so u have show many images or articles and keep scrollin..right?
[00:14:30] <ivankuzev> yeah thats what this one does
[00:14:53] <ivankuzev> but you probably want somethin that works only on button press
[00:15:01] * tw2113 notes down that my stuff above isn't limited to flexslider
[00:15:10] <tw2113> just any tht offer callbacks after slides move
[00:15:23] <slartsa> http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/ what am I doing horribly wrong? I want to load htm-pages to a single div but instead they just open
[00:15:54] <yen_> tw2113 but i'll try it since u recco'd it.
[00:16:03] <yen_> i cant seem to find it in wp plugin search
[00:16:16] <yen_> man, its 3:16am! sick
[00:16:48] <tw2113> you may have to add the files yourself
[00:17:01] <yen_> really?
[00:17:02] <yen_> :-s
[00:17:07] <yen_> ugh. never done that before..
[00:17:27] <yen_> always think something like that will break wp.
[00:18:06] <yen_> would this work? jcarousel Horizonal slider
[00:18:24] <tw2113> you won't break WP
[00:19:09] <yen_> jcarousel Horizonal slider -- no?
[00:19:24] <yen_> tw2113 do u own any plugins?
[00:19:29] <yen_> i would love to use
[00:19:33] <yen_> or try
[00:19:43] <tw2113> probably not
[00:21:02] <yen_> where shall i ftp over the entire folder? into plugins?
[00:22:15] <tw2113> i'd probably put them in your theme folder, then follow the instructions for using wp_enqueue_script
[00:23:25] <yen_> inside the theme or in the root of theme?
[00:23:55] <coldhead> do you chaps want to take this to ##wordpress?
[00:24:03] <tw2113> i dunno about the url loading part slartsa but i have this part working:    $(document).ready(function(){ $(".lowermenu a").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('#shop_articles').load(this.href); }); });
[00:24:17] <tw2113> *whines* do i have to?
[00:25:14] <yen_> slarta?
[00:25:34] <tw2113> was helping someone else for a moment
[00:25:47] <yen_> ha ha how dare you?
[00:25:50] <yen_> lol j/k
[00:26:03] <yen_> i added the folder inside the theme
[00:26:09] <yen_> nw i doing the other stuff
[00:26:23] * tw2113 refuses to listen to coldhead 
[00:26:39] <coldhead> i'm just being curmudgeonly, please carry on
[00:26:53] <tw2113> i was going to stop with the WP help in here though
[00:26:59] <tw2113> but i wasn't going to go to the room
[00:27:09] <slartsa> yen_: yes?
[00:27:39] <yen_> tw2113 where exactly is does #1. in the instructions go?
[00:27:43] <yen_> <link rel="stylesheet" href="flexslider.css" type="text/css"> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="jquery.flexslider.js"></script>   ??
[00:28:25] <ivankuzev> that looks ok yen_
[00:29:08] * tw2113 has a blog post to type
[00:29:18] <yen_> yes he does
[00:29:24] <freazy> hi, can anyone help me pls. i want that the content slide out of the screen ( maybe to top: -999 ), but it wont work http://jsfiddle.net/v9v5a/2/
[00:30:03] <slartsa> uh oh, tw2113 was helping me there, sorry missed it :)
[00:30:47] <tw2113> i was able to console.log the href with that slartsa
[00:31:36] <yen_> http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/ -- lost of #2
[00:31:43] <yen_> are these wp instructions?
[00:32:27] <tw2113> the add markup spot?
[00:32:33] <tw2113> no, that's an html step
[00:33:24] <slartsa> tw2113: oh ok, your version loaded the page! but why does it load the content to .lowermenu as well as in #shop_articles?
[00:33:39] <yen_> yes step 2
[00:33:45] <yen_> does that go into the footer
[00:34:10] <tw2113> that goes where you want your slider to appear yen_
[00:34:17] <tw2113> dunno on the rest slartsa
[00:34:24] <tw2113> never said it was a full solution :D
[00:34:49] <yen_> ah in the post page?
[00:34:54] <hirsty> Hey jquery warriors ive a problem with my jquery now it works flawlessly on both chrome and firefox but my slidetoggle command only seems to run once on the dreaded IE
[00:35:13] <hirsty> using jquery 1.7.1
[00:35:18] <slartsa> I demand a full solution for my money! err wait.. :)
[00:35:45] <tw2113> pay me first so i can refund you
[00:37:28] <hirsty> basically ive a popup onSelect on a datepicker and using the slidetoggle on three menu options in the popup div and for the first popup it works fine but on choosing a different date it doesnt seem to want to slide open my divs
[00:37:52] <yen_> tw2113 i wan the slider to appear in a post. but i dont think u meant that
[00:38:38] <yen_> tw2113 post page or single.php or footer.php?
[00:38:56] <tw2113> i don't know where you want the slider itself to appear
[00:39:17] <yen_> i will be inserting slideshows inside a post
[00:39:23] <yen_> like any other slideshow...
[00:39:44] <yen_> so my question is, does this go in the single.php or new post?
[00:41:14] <tw2113> the markup part?
[00:41:18] <tw2113> it goes with the slideshow
[00:41:33] <tw2113> post editor in your case if you're putting them in posts
[00:42:05] <tw2113> knowing me, i'd put that part in the single.php part and use custom fields to store the image urls
[00:42:18] <tw2113> but that's getting into a different can of worms
[00:42:23] <yen_> thats what i was askn
[00:42:34] <tw2113> and is off topic for this room
[00:42:51] <yen_> that entire html goes inside post editor
[00:44:09] <tw2113> it goes wherever you need it when setting up your slider
[00:44:30] <tw2113> and there are many many ways you can handle that part
[00:45:32] <yen_> ok i added it in post editor for now and there are just 3 bullets.
[00:45:44] <yen_> and so im doing with #1, #2 an #3.
[00:45:50] <yen_> and no idea what to do with #$.
[00:45:52] <yen_> 4
[00:46:29] <tw2113> step 4 just lists all the available options
[00:46:41] <hirsty> why does IE have to be a pain in the backside -_-
[00:46:41] <yen_> ok...
[00:46:44] <ivankuzev> <yen_>:its variants for step3
[00:46:45] <tw2113> click the advanced tab
[00:46:55] <yen_> thanks both of u
[00:47:05] <tw2113> excellent point ivankuzev
[00:47:35] <yen_> ok
[00:47:39] <yen_> this is insan.
[00:47:40] <yen_> e
[00:47:50] <yen_> i think im abt to pull my haor
[00:47:52] <yen_> hair
[00:47:53] <crooksey_> I know this might seem like an easy question, but im a python dev just toying with jquery for a site we are working on, im using http://www.redips.net/javascript/drag-and-drop-table-row/ how would I generate the JSON data for the tables once I have moved all of my data around?
[00:47:57] <tw2113> yen_ click the advanced tab, scroll to the 3rd from last gray box
[00:48:01] <tw2113> follow what it shows there
[00:48:14] <tw2113> specifically the "after" part which i showed you earlier
[00:48:33] <tw2113> if hair pulling is what I get for someone else learning, i hope i make the world more bald than Hulk Hogan
[00:48:59] <yen_> where does that go.
[00:49:00] <yen_> ?
[00:49:17] <tw2113> that's the part that would go towards the end to control the slider
[00:49:32] <yen_> yeah but where i am putting this code?
[00:49:41] <tw2113> right before the </body> tag
[00:49:51] <yen_> post editor again/
[00:49:52] <yen_> ?
[00:49:57] <tw2113> no
[00:50:32] <coldhead> no u
[00:50:38] <yen_> no way
[00:54:00] <yen_> ?
[00:54:15] <yen_> #jquery
[00:54:48] <yen_> ivankuzev
[00:54:57] <yen_> tw2113
[00:55:32] <mazzachre> I am using the jqueryui selectmenu plugin, and have a slight issue. When I add an icon, long entries gets "width of icon" pixels too wide for the menu so sudenly I get X scrollbag as well as Y scroll bar, can this be fixed somewhere?
[00:55:40] <hirsty> can anyone help with any reason slidetoggle would work a first time but not a second in IE?
[00:59:08] <mazzachre> hirsty: It is IE... Well, which IE are you using?
[00:59:20] <hirsty> IE9
[00:59:45] <hirsty> but using the dev thing to try the same for 8 and 7
[01:00:42] <mazzachre> Then first part of my answer goes :) It is IE... I don't know really, but IE does have a number of issues, try looking through bug reports to see if anyone else have that problem?
[01:06:49] <mazzachre> My problem with X scrolling only seems to appear on "very long" entries... Even with entries that fill the entire width of the widget in smaller select boxes does not do this...
[01:06:50] <sanova> hi
[01:07:47] <sanova> is there a plugin to have a toolbar with jquery?
[01:08:18] <mazzachre> sanova: yes
[01:09:32] <sanova> mazzachre: i found only "button" widget
[01:14:46] <mazzachre> sanova: You could google jqueryui toolbar that should give you the toolbar plugin
[01:23:34] <SionEngine> Hi
[01:23:52] <joeyjones> weird
[01:23:56] <SionEngine> i want to do that : http://www.webpopulation.com/ on jQuery
[01:24:01] <SionEngine> it's possible ?
[01:24:16] <joeyjones> i managed to make a layout that seems to not work on 1 page but works on another :p
[01:25:21] <sanova> i'm looking at this one: http://vmx.cx/jquery/ui/ui/ui.toolbar.js but maybe it's not compatible with last jquery version
[01:30:50] <DireFog> this is really getting ridiculous. Why does that *still* appear to be causing the default action for a form submit? (el really is the form element) https://gist.github.com/44f9f7a244cedcaf3c78
[01:34:02] <DireFog> oooh look there, an exception \o/
[01:35:20] <slartsa> aaargh
[01:35:47] <joeyjones> weird
[01:35:56] <joeyjones> i managed to make a horribly buggy layout
[01:36:22] <slartsa> http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/4/ why does this keep pushing requested page into .lowermenu???
[01:37:11] <hirsty> Grrrr this is annoying -_-
[01:37:21] <slartsa> it is
[01:37:46] <joeyjones> when i toggle a hidden div to visible it overlays
[01:37:50] <hirsty> i would just burn IE if i could....but i cant :(
[01:37:57] <SionEngine> :(
[01:38:36] <hirsty> Slide toggling refusing to repeat :/
[01:40:28] <joeyjones> hirsty: just refuse IE for your site :p
[01:40:55] <hirsty> cant do that lol although i would love to
[01:41:52] <joeyjones> hirsty: why not?
[01:42:05] <joeyjones> most people use firefox, opera, or chrome anyway
[01:42:36] <hirsty> because its not my site im just working on it + is used to sell products
[01:43:21] <joeyjones> hirsty: aahh
[01:43:29] <joeyjones> if it's a commerce site that's different
[01:44:35] <phxheat> hi, what's the best way to detect when an element (a select element in this case) has loaded in via ajax? i need to run a function on it after it has loaded.  im rusty with js
[01:45:03] <NodeX> your ajax function to load it in should log a variable
[01:45:20] <NodeX> *you should log a variable
[01:47:05] <phxheat> NodeX: thanks. i think i got it
[01:54:27] <Flo0815> hey guys, whats the selector for a div and all its children?
[01:54:43] <Flo0815> i want to fadeOut an overlay on click
[01:55:22] <mindis|wurk> you only need to fade the parent to fade all of them
[01:55:25] <seutje> Flo0815: fading out the div will also fade out its children
[01:55:34] <Flo0815> i know
[01:55:48] <mindis|wurk> and?
[01:56:00] <Flo0815> but $('#overlay').on(click... starts only if i click directly on #overlay
[01:56:07] <joesavage> I've got a client-side search setup all ready, with a query and a number of article XML nodes - does anyone know of a jQuery search algorithm that I could use to search through and prioritise the articles by importance? (I've tried writing my own and it's proving difficult)
[01:56:15] <Flo0815> but i want to fadeout if i click #overlay or any chidlren
[01:56:40] <Flo0815> $('#overlay *').on ...  doesn't work
[01:56:58] <mindis|wurk> the event should be triggered when clicking the children as well unless you've stopped propagation
[02:02:00] <Bennit> Hi
[02:02:30] <hooloovoo> hi Bennit
[02:02:53] <Bennit> how comes that .attr on a selector that spans multiple elements doesn't return an array of elements? :(
[02:03:19] <hooloovoo> Bennit: that's a good question
[02:04:18] <Bennit> now I have to use map with an anonymous function simply to extract an attribute out of each element
[02:04:55] <NodeX> because the attr() function get's a single attribute and it's not a selector
[02:06:28] <Bennit> jQuery('div.panel-sub > div > div').attr('title'), should in my eyes return [title1,title2,...], yet it returns only title1
[02:06:38] <Bennit> which is even less logic than returning undefined
[02:06:48] <Bennit> imo
[02:08:50] <Bennit> anyways, why I didn't want to use .each (which is what they say you should use on the .attr() documentation) is because the function takes the index as the first parameter and then the value, which makes my IDE nag that I don't use the index
[02:08:51] <hooloovoo> Bennit: actually i agree. there might be a good reason that it's the way it is tho.
[02:09:19] <hooloovoo> Bennit: get a proper ide =P
[02:09:57] <Bennit> it's logical it nags, an unused variable is an unused variable
[02:13:04] <NodeX> attr() is not a seelctor
[02:13:08] <NodeX> selector*
[02:13:42] <mattfield> Joined in late here @bennit, what're you trying to do
[02:13:43] <mattfield> ?
[02:14:34] <Bennit> it's not something hard to do, I just expected it to be even easier using .attr()
[02:14:59] <Bennit> (obtain a map of all title fields of elements described by my selector)
[02:15:13] <hooloovoo> NodeX: nope, isn't it a function that returns the attribute or sets a attribute on the selected elements?
[02:15:27] <NodeX> hooloovoo : correct
[02:15:44] <hooloovoo> NodeX: if the answer is yes, doesn't that mean it logically should return a list of attributes of you have lots of elements selected?
[02:15:51] <NodeX> no
[02:15:59] <NodeX> because it expects ONE element
[02:16:05] <hooloovoo> NodeX: i'm not trying to argue, i just wanna know why it does this.
[02:16:12] <NodeX> ^
[02:16:39] <hooloovoo> NodeX: i know that, but why does it do that?
[02:16:49] <Bennit> (tags along hooloovoo's wagon)
[02:16:56] <hooloovoo> i mean, is there a reason it's build like that instead of returning all the values?
[02:17:16] * hooloovoo hugs Bennit 
[02:17:25] <seutje> Bennit: you don't have to specify the arguments if you don't use them
[02:17:33] <NodeX> because looping internaly is a wate of time when most normal people use it on one element
[02:17:39] <NodeX> wate -> waste
[02:18:28] <NodeX> also, who's to say in the list that would be returned which attr belongs to which selector?
[02:18:32] <seutje> Bennit: http://gillescochez.info/2011/08/06/jquery-javascript-attrs/
[02:18:49] <NodeX> imagine the selector $('.foo, .bar, #baz');
[02:19:01] <mattfield> Exactly. The typical use case is to return a specific attribute on one element, not multiple
[02:19:17] <NodeX> there is no way to garuntee the order of the attr()'s
[02:19:19] <seutje> oh wait, that does something completely different, lol
[02:19:24] <hooloovoo> NodeX: well... they could be returned in the same order as the jquery array.
[02:19:38] <hooloovoo> NodeX: first element in that array is the first attribute in the returned array
[02:19:40] <NodeX> hooloovoo : that's not garunteed
[02:20:04] <NodeX> #baz is faster lookup than .come-complex-query even though it sits on the end of the selector string
[02:20:41] <NodeX> .some-complex-query*
[02:20:45] <hooloovoo> NodeX: aren't the arrays ordered when iterating over them?
[02:20:54] <seutje> guess u could monkeypatch it, but I wouldn't recommend that
[02:21:02] <NodeX> perhaps we should slow down the entire sizzle library to make room for this feature ? :P
[02:21:48] <hooloovoo> umm... what does this part has to do with sazzle?
[02:22:04] <hooloovoo> it's running on the return data on sazzle
[02:22:15] <NodeX> err
[02:22:17] <NodeX> lool
[02:22:26] <hooloovoo> ok
[02:22:26] <NodeX> do I really have to explain that - it's pretty obvious
[02:23:02] <hooloovoo> $(".bleh") returns a array
[02:23:09] <hooloovoo> then you run .attr() on that array
[02:23:27] <hooloovoo> i don't see how the performance of the selector affect what happens after that
[02:23:37] <NodeX> seriously?
[02:23:47] <hooloovoo> srsly
[02:24:05] <NodeX> feed in a complex set of selectors and see which one comes back first
[02:24:13] <seutje> $.fn.attrs = function(name, value) { var attrs = []; this.each(function(){ attrs[] = $(this).attr(name, value); }); return attrs; } or something?
[02:24:22] <NodeX> you expect it to come back in the order that you put it in
[02:24:29] <seutje> make that attrs.push(), damn php habits
[02:25:17] <seutje> and prolly better with a map
[02:25:34] <hooloovoo> NodeX: sooo... $(".bleh").attr() is not the same as var a = $(".bleh"); a.attr()?
[02:25:53] <NodeX> I didn't say that
[02:25:59] <NodeX> you're thinking to small
[02:26:07] <hooloovoo> probably. i always am =(
[02:26:08] <NodeX> $('.bleh'); would work
[02:26:39] <NodeX> but .... $('.blhe, #foo, input.foo:last-child blah blha blah'); is alot more complex
[02:27:23] <NodeX> and you cannot garuntee the order they are returned from Sizzle, if your script that expects attr()[0] to be .bleh and it's not then you're screwed
[02:27:27] <hooloovoo> NodeX: yes i know that. but how does that prevent it from returning a array after it's done?
[02:27:40] <NodeX> as I just said
[02:28:04] <hooloovoo> hmmm
[02:28:11] <hooloovoo> have to look throught the sizzle source
[02:28:18] <NodeX> there#s no hmm - that's the way it is
[02:28:58] <hooloovoo> NodeX: maybe, but i still wanna know why =P
[02:29:11] <hooloovoo> i'm not trying to argue with you, i'm trying to learn what's going on.
[02:30:37] <NodeX> I've explained why
[02:32:36] <vectorshelve> I need to create a jquery browser plugin for my site like FB zoom where hovering over the image could enlarge the view.. any ideas on how to go abt it ?
[02:34:38] <vectorshelve> Cork: mate any suggestion on the above ?
[02:35:57] <mattfield> How to go about creating a plugin, or how to trigger the zoom?
[02:36:26] <vectorshelve> mattfield: both :) I am new to it so
[02:36:51] <Bennit> well that's enough arguing for today, cya guys!
[02:37:01] <vectorshelve> mattfield: I have a similar sought of site like FB with timeline views and all... so I want the same plugin to be working for my site
[02:39:49] <mattfield> vectorshelve: the jQuery docs have a pretty extensive article http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring, and Jonathon Snook wrote a nice intro too http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/jquery_plugin/
[02:40:36] <mattfield> vectorshelve: you basically extend the jQuery object
[02:43:00] <niels__> is there an effective way of doing this in jquery/js? equiv from php? http://pastebin.com/KZ6CHz7f
[02:56:32] * mattfield niels__: String.prototype.toProperCase = function () {
[02:56:33] * mattfield     return this.replace(/\w\S*/g, function(txt){return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();});
[02:56:34] * mattfield };
[02:56:46] <mattfield> niels__: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/196972/convert-string-to-title-case-with-javascript
[02:57:04] <mattfield> That function will get you part of the way, converting uppercase into title case
[02:59:53] <LSshock> im using json() and the json returns [object] *: "text here"
[03:00:08] <LSshock> how can i use that since i cant do data.text.*
[03:00:16] <LSshock> while data.text gives me the object
[03:01:02] <mattfield> LSshock: you're doing an ajax request that returns a JSON object?
[03:01:15] <LSshock> getjSON() i meant
[03:01:53] <mattfield> LSshock: $.getJSON(url, function(data) { console.log(data); });
[03:02:03] <mattfield> That will console.log the JSON response
[03:02:06] <prodn> I am trying to push data from server to client with long polling technique. I make use of $.ajax to send the request async with a POST, the server makes the $_POST['var'] loop in PHP while ($_POST['var'] == $var_from_db), that is, until the resp. var in database is updated. The thing is, if the server gives no respond to that ajax request, I can't click on other links on the site or make other requests. First I thought it might be tha
[03:02:09] <LSshock> i know but i have never seen *:"" before
[03:02:24] <LSshock> usually i could do text[0] and get the first ""
[03:02:32] <LSshock> i can fiddle what i have
[03:02:42] <prodn> but I was wrong. So anyone have any suggestions on how to solve the problem? I have been following this guide: http://dsheiko.com/weblog/websockets-vs-sse-vs-long-polling/ (the first one with long polling)
[03:02:46] <mattfield> LSshock: is the JSON valid?
[03:03:13] <mattfield> LSshock: yeah, throw a fiddle together
[03:04:42] <vectorshelve> mattfield: sorry got loggoed out
[03:05:08] <zatan> Hey I am using $.get and getting this data http://dpaste.com/779277/  but one library HighCharts.js is not loaded is there anyway I can load these libraries dinamicaly ?
[03:05:10] <LSshock> mattfield: http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/FtMBb/ so i
[03:05:13] <LSshock> i
[03:05:16] <LSshock> darn keys
[03:05:36] <LSshock> i'm not sure how to get the *:"" out of it, might seem silly, just never had that json before
[03:05:50] <LSshock> *that type of json
[03:07:25] <sahbeewah> data.parse.text['*']
[03:07:54] <LSshock> sahbeewah: that did it, thanks, didnt know i could do that :)
[03:08:26] <mattfield> vectorshelve: no worries, did you get the two links I sent?
[03:08:33] <badoskie> is there any jquery content slider that is compatible with IE6 out of the box?
[03:08:41] <LSshock> mattfield: i have my answer, thanks for wanting to help out
[03:09:06] <vectorshelve> mattfield: yes the second link had nothing in it. tell me creating that sought of a chrome plugin (FB zoom) for my site.. is it difficult and a big task ?
[03:09:06] <mattfield> LSshock: no worries. sahbeewah got in there just before me :)
[03:10:27] <mattfield> it's not a huge task and not terribly difficult. though could be if you haven't written a plugin before
[03:10:46] <mattfield> vectorshelve: it's not a huge task and not terribly difficult. though could be if you haven't written a plugin before
[03:15:07] <peiper> hi, why does .on('click') and .click() not work on td's ?
[03:16:47] <WolfieZero> peiper: $('td').on('click', function() {console.log('test')}); Works for me
[03:17:28] <badoskie> is there any jquery content slider that is compatible with IE6 out of the box?
[03:17:33] <peiper> WolfieZero, must it be inside document ready block?
[03:17:55] <WolfieZero> I think so.
[03:18:20] <peiper> .on didnt worked but .live did
[03:18:30] <peiper> the td's are being generated on the fly (ajax stuff)
[03:18:39] <mindis|wurk> yeah, classical beginner mistake ;)
[03:18:41] <peiper> thanks anyways!
[03:18:52] <WolfieZero> Ah that would be why ;)
[03:18:57] <vectorshelve> mattfield: ok then perhaps it's gonna be difficult for me since I haven't written a plugin before :)
[03:19:00] <mattfield> if they're being generated on the fly, use .live or bind .on('click') to the parent.
[03:23:54] <mattfield> vectorshelve: are there no plugins out there that offer similar functionality?
[03:24:36] <vectorshelve> mattfield: I wish if there were plugins in which I could just change the site domain and it would start working for it as well.. I doubt if there are any.. you would know better !! thanks
[03:34:18] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. How come this isn't posted with IE: http://jsfiddle.net/QVutJ/ ?
[03:34:34] <jaffipaffi> It's like it prevents the script to auto-submit
[03:34:45] <jaffipaffi> And is there a fix for that?
[03:41:49] <sunbeam> I see the error, myvar is undefined, while i did var myvar = "";
[03:41:50] <sunbeam> any idea what can be wrong?
[03:48:44] <majd> hey #jquery - i have a fairly big application that uses jquery UI. I want to port that to tablets/mobiles. Should i be using jquery UI on the tablet? or should i use jquery mobile for that?
[03:52:50] <mattfield> sunbeam: if you have var myvar = "", then it's normal to return undefined.
[03:54:22] <mattfield> sunbeam: actually, hang on, how are you using it?
[03:57:42] <Trisox> any one seen that website with the webtrend map?
[03:57:48] <mattfield> jaffipaffi: for starters, 'document' doesn't need the quotation marks
[04:00:04] <mattfield> jaffipaffi: also, I think IE only fires the change event for a file input on blur
[04:01:42] <mattfield> Trisox: the one from iA?
[04:02:35] <Trisox> no website by a rusian guy
[04:03:00] <Trisox> men i was there few days ago cant find it any more
[04:03:49] <mattfield> Can't say I have, no.
[04:04:22] <Trisox> shit happens
[04:05:18] <mazzachre> "form > input[data-mydata]" is a lot faster than "foreach form.elements.length" right?
[04:06:49] <jaffipaffi> mattfield: Strange thing is that it _is_ triggered in IE.. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/QVutJ/1/
[04:06:54] <jaffipaffi> But it just doesn't submit
[04:06:59] <jaffipaffi> Works in Chrome/FF just fine
[04:07:38] <mattfield> which IE?
[04:07:40] <Trisox> $("form").find("input[data-mydata]");
[04:08:29] <jaffipaffi> mattfield: I just tried in IE7 and IE9
[04:08:31] <Trisox> thats ie seccurty i think if i remember corectly
[04:08:59] <Trisox> doesnt allow manipulation of upload
[04:09:34] <Trisox> else you could select a file location for the user and upload lets say his hostfile dunno ;)
[04:10:42] <mattfield> Could it simply be that you're trying to auto-upload but you've also got a submit input in there too?
[04:11:27] <Bennit> back again!
[04:11:51] <Bennit> $.getScript reports the following error in console: Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[04:11:54] <Bennit> (chrome)
[04:12:27] <jaffipaffi> mattfield: I just tried a simple form with just file input and onchange="this.form.submit", but in IE console I get "access denied".. So I guess it's because of the f***ing security
[04:12:34] <Bennit> read a bit about it and it's got something to do with chrome's policy on loading script code that's more strict than IE&Firefox
[04:13:21] <mattfield> jaffipaffi: Ah. That sucks.
[04:14:04] <Bennit> (this is on local files, not a domain
[04:14:19] <Bennit> so all the files are hosted by the filesystem, not by a webserver
[04:14:23] <Bennit> if that has something to do with it
[04:14:47] <mattfield> jaffipaffi: have you tried from a web server rather than just localhost?
[04:15:06] <jaffipaffi> mattfield: I'm working on my development server so it is online
[04:15:08] <Bennit> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8166 # aha, /me reads on
[04:15:31] <jaffipaffi> Hmm... That kinda forces me to use uploadify/something like that
[04:16:28] <Bennit> aww , ticket set to "wontfix".. use crossDomain = true
[04:16:51] <Bennit> let's see if there's any help in chromium, since I think the problem lies more with them
[04:17:09] <mattfield> Kinda does, yeah.
[04:19:52] <stream> good day sir(s)
[04:22:10] <soee> is it possible somehow to add some listener to link, so when this specific link class change something is done ? example: there is list and each element can have active class but for only one of this elements when its class changes also some additional action is executed
[04:24:42] <mattfield> soee: Kind of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1397251/event-detect-when-css-property-changed-using-jquery
[04:26:15] <mattfield> soee: although, IE <9 doesn't support mutation events at all, and WebKit is spotty
[04:26:26] <mattfield> soee: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Mutation_events
[04:27:10] <mattfield> soee: plus, listening to mutation events causes a massive degradation in performance
[04:27:27] <soee> ok, ill try different solution for my problem
[04:27:39] <mindis|wurk> "as the API's design is flawed" might as well consider everything related to webdev deprecated then...
[04:28:17] <bailus> the dom?

[04:46:16] <johnkpaul> NodeX: you mean learning resources? have you gone through MDN?
[04:46:33] <NodeX> no canvas resources
[04:46:38] <NodeX> perhaps maps others have built

[04:52:57] <toresbe> Whoo. Lucky there's a proper IRC channel for this. Just a quick question... I have a form that I'd like to submit to a Django script, which returns a value. What is the current, recommended way of using forms with Django via jQuery?
[04:53:08] <toresbe> Should I just use jQuery to POST the data?
[04:53:42] <mindis|wurk> sounds good to me
[04:54:24] <toresbe> thanks
[04:55:12] <johnkpaul> toresbe: django has built in csrf protection
[04:55:14] <NodeX> thanks
[04:55:24] <johnkpaul> so you have to override ajaxsetup methods to add that csrf property
[04:55:40] <toresbe> johnkpaul: yeah, I think I have that bit down

[05:01:40] <mazzachre> Is it possible to bind both click and dblclick on the same element? I have just tried and click gets triggered every time, I can't seem to dblclick it any more?
[05:02:21] <vectorshelve> mazzachre: I dont think so...
[05:03:03] <mazzachre> Damned... Anyone with an idea?
[05:03:44] <mattfield> I don't think it's possible either
[05:03:49] <mattfield> What're you trying to do?
[05:03:55] <mindis|wurk> can't think of anything since doubleclick is...well, two clicks
[05:04:50] <sahbeewah> yea you can bind both on the same element...
[05:04:59] <sahbeewah> ansolas: .index()
[05:05:03] <mindis|wurk> i suppose you could create something hacky with timeouts
[05:05:51] <prodn> I have a problem with long polling. When jquery sent the ajax request the browser waits for that request before I can make other ones. I can't make other navigations on the site. I am trying to do something like facebook notifications. Can anyone help me? Look here: http://pastebin.com/p9wQnet4
[05:06:03] <mazzachre> Well, I have been given this task: "Elements describe some stuff in a time table", "Single click = open timedata for edit", "Double click = open element in detail view for editing"... detail view includes stuff like customer data (The element is a customer reservation of a resource), resource data, other resource selection, etc. etc...

[05:12:08] <becom33> how to *
[05:13:02] <prodn> becom33: I am not sure as of what you are trying to do. You can put a <div> there and populate it with feed from DB, RSS or whatever. Are you trying to make a debugger of some sort?

[05:18:49] <mazzachre> So, what could I do to make a good UI for the users here? Editing time of a single object or showing the underlying data for this representation of the object?
[05:21:45] <mattfield> mazzachre: Having two different possible interactions on a single element is totally confusing
[05:22:27] <mattfield> mazzachre: You could have a popup that appears on hover, with a link to open detail view
[05:23:16] <mazzachre> mattfield: It already have a tooltip... The tooltip shows some info, like the stuff that should be editable...
[05:23:46] <mattfield> mazzachre: maybe list that info, then have the link to edit underneath
[05:24:13] <mattfield> mazzachre: regardless, the click + dblclick really won't work as a user interaction
[05:25:08] <mazzachre> mattfield: Ya, I kind of get that... Must talk to the user experience team again... (Gotta love large organizations)
[05:25:30] <mattfield> mazzachre: yep, it'd be worth it
[05:27:43] <fusion27> How would you guys tighten this code up? http://pastie.org/4371226
[05:27:53] <fusion27> I'd love to get it down to one line
[05:28:01] <fusion27> My JS-fu is weak
[05:30:40] <mindis|wurk> everything on one line? ewwww
[05:30:57] <quicksilver> fusion27: arrDataSelect2CoursesOther.push({ id : v[0], text: v[2]})
[05:31:09] <quicksilver> fusion27: saves you three lines in the inner 'if'
[05:31:11] <ravenzz> so I need a polyfill to the :checked css3 selector for radio buttons, http://jsfiddle.net/8vHAe/ what is wrong with this?
[05:31:41] <fusion27> mindis|wurk:  just for edification
[05:32:09] <fusion27> thanks quicksilver
[05:32:17] <ravenzz> my guess is that on ie7/8 when the change event for the radio button is not triggered when it is selected by clicking the label
[05:33:07] <mindis|wurk> i guess you could reduce it further by using if shorthands for the condition but personally i hate those
[05:33:38] <masak> a very common scenario: some link's .click does a .show() on a form referenced by an attribute of the link. is there a way to make the selection before .show() without resorting to string concatenation?
[05:33:49] <masak> i.e. right now I have
[05:33:50] <masak> $('[data-replace-form="' + $(this).attr('data-replace-id') + '"]').show();
[05:33:59] <masak> but is there a more elegant, direct way?
[05:34:50] <fusion27> mindis|wurk: that ternary operator?
[05:35:04] <fusion27> those are tough on the eyes, agreed
[05:35:54] <mindis|wurk> maybe it's just me but i have to stop every time i see one of those and start reading it carefully what it does
[05:36:21] <mindis|wurk> it just doesn't snap into place in my mind like the long version does
[05:43:08] <fusion27> yeah mindis|wurk too much going on in too little space, it

[06:21:44] <lilalinuxHamburg> i.e. $(option.hide).attr('disabled', true)
[06:22:03] <boulet101010> you want to say the selected option?
[06:22:12] <lilalinuxHamburg> optionS
[06:22:16] <lilalinuxHamburg> plural
[06:22:36] <lilalinuxHamburg> do I need .each()?
[06:22:53] <Jagan_> hi..
[06:23:14] <lilalinuxHamburg> got it
[06:23:19] <lilalinuxHamburg> the select itself was wrong
[06:23:21] <lilalinuxHamburg> O_o
[06:24:04] <EnginA> for(var i in arr){ $(html_code).appendTo('#foo').draggable({helper: function(){ return '<div class"' + i + '">test</div>'; }});
[06:24:11] <EnginA> class is always the last i
[06:24:18] <EnginA> what core javacript concept i'm missing here
[06:24:23] <boulet101010> k
[06:24:33] <boulet101010> lilalinuxHamburg: cause you don't need each
[06:24:51] <boulet101010> $("option[selected='selected']") is enough
[06:24:54] <lilalinuxHamburg> yeah, tried that in the first place, but the selector was wrong :-)
[06:25:03] <Jagan_> Jquery ui dialog not dispalying. once i dragged that dialog when i come to next time on that its not dipalying

[06:53:16] <Jeff_D> Guys, how do I *ask* a jQuery object for its event handler? I know events have to be re-bound after attaching new nodes to the DOM, so what I want is, say, to ask all the buttons in the new fragment what their click-event handlers are, attach the fragment to the DOM, and then reattach the handlers *without knowing or caring where they were originally set or what they were set to*. Any ideas?
[06:55:48] <azariah_> what's the best way to have editable hyperlinks using jquery?
[06:57:01] <EnginA> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[06:57:12] <EnginA> very second code sample is only to use $ instead of jQuery ?
[06:57:55] <stuffmc> Hi Folks
[06:58:05] <stuffmc> What's a smarter way of doing: $($(".doc")[1]).css("display")
[06:58:07] <warrenparsons> Jeff_D: Trying to understand exactly what you're asking: Is it important that you know what the original event handlers in the fragment were? Or are you just wanting to add new event handlers when the fragment is added to the DOM?
[06:58:08] <Jeff_D> azariah_: I'd stick a little button or other UI bling next to the hyperlink; when that gets clicked, either replace the <a> link with a <textarea>, or pop up a little dialog if you want the user to be able to edit both the URL and the text
[06:58:21] <stuffmc> the "not smart" here being $($(".doc")[1])
[06:58:31] <stuffmc> how to get the second
[06:58:34] <stuffmc> "".doc"
[06:58:35] <Haprog> EnginA: yes, it shows you how to alias jQuery as simply $ in your plugin's scope by wrapping it in an anonymous function.
[06:58:54] <Jeff_D> warrenparsons: I want to know what the existing event handlers are, so that I can add the fragment to the DOM and attach the previous handlers back to where they "should" be
[06:59:03] <azariah_> Jeff_D: ok, thanks!
[06:59:07] <Haprog> EnginA: but jQuery doesn't have to be globally available as $.
[06:59:53] <ries> anybody happen to know a website where I can read about the issues with the new Safari 6 and jquery? Loads of websites just don't work very well anymore. THis is a bug at Apple, right?
[07:00:34] <stuffmc> ok found
[07:00:35] <stuffmc> .doc:eq(1)
[07:00:38] <warrenparsons> Jeff_D: Okay. That's not a use case I've run into personally. As a starting point, you'd need to get those event handlers before the fragment was separated/copied from its original document.
[07:01:52] <Jeff_D> ok. in the code I'm working with, that could happen at any of 3-4 points, but they all funnel through one place where the fragments are attached to the DOM. I was hoping to leverage that choke point by reading before and setting after.
[07:02:39] <Jeff_D> warrenparsons: sounds like I'm going to need to go up a layer, and add the event handlers to my 'reload-events' object when they're originally attached to the nodes in question.
[07:03:22] <MINTTU> how to i append html next to a specific id ? Image beside <input id='..' />
[07:03:50] <warrenparsons> Jeff_D: Without knowing the specifics of your project, I can say that if I needed to do something like that in my own work, I'd probably take a different approach. Maybe useing js- prefixed classes to attach specific events in the original placement of the code in question, which I could then use  delegation in the destination context to execute against.
[07:04:30] <MINTTU> $("#id").append("<img>"); will insert html inside the tag, i want html after that id.
[07:04:43] <mattfield> MINTTU: $(element).after("<img/>");
[07:04:50] <MINTTU> ooh:D
[07:04:54] <MINTTU> thanks
[07:05:11] <mattfield> You're welcome!
[07:05:17] <Jeff_D> warrenparsons: ah, yes; delegation. haven't yet used it but that sounds like a more viable/natural solution than adding yet another god object to the mix :P
[07:05:50] <warrenparsons> Jeff_D: Delegation is your friend. Learn it, love it, touch it in uncomfortable places. It will make your life much easier.
[07:06:43] <warrenparsons> Jeff_D: The .on/.off event model in jQuery 1.7+ makes it ridiculously easy to use, also.
[07:06:55] <Jeff_D> warrenparsons: thanks much; why build my own god object when jQuery has one of its own? :P I'm back into the ooze.
[07:07:13] <Jeff_D> and thanks!
[07:07:17] <warrenparsons> Sure thing.
[07:12:11] <EnderMB> I bet this is asked all the time, but I'm looking for a content carousel where each slide could have a different layout (i.e. one as a full image, one with a background and a text box, one with an embedded video, etc). What would you guys/girls recommend?
[07:15:24] <jtrick> Are jQueryUI items open for discussion here?
[07:16:21] <warrenparsons> EnderMB: jCarousel is pretty popular, and I've used it a few times. It's pretty easy to roll your own though if you can't find a plugin with the right features.
[07:17:05] <warrenparsons> EnderMB: Actually I like jCarouselLite better. I don't think the projects are related.
[07:22:35] <EnderMB> warrenparsons: Thanks for the link. I'll check them both out
[07:22:47] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have a number of "products" displayed on the same page. Each product has a number of properties, displayed in a different <ul> on the same page. I want to be able to select all the data on the same page related to one of the products. Is it a good idea to give each product a unique class, so that eventually i can do something like $(".product-0"), and collect all the segments of the data into the same place?
[07:23:16] <majd> i don't think this is the intention of why classes were created, but it seems like it could serve my purpose
[07:24:25] <jtrick> majd: I do that kind of thing all the time
[07:25:32] <jtrick> although I typically use id if there's a unique identifier for the 'product'. You could also consider using data-
[07:25:49] <zatan> hey is it possible in jquery do somethink like this: "Live Price: £" + if(5>2) { echo "boom"} + "  dollars" ?
[07:26:51] <majd> jtrick: i'm using django in my backend, the data structure is fairly complex, but i do have a unique id for each 'product'
[07:27:28] <jtrick> zatan: Depends on what "live price" is.  (5 > 2) will always resolve as true
[07:27:41] <blackspotwiggins> zatan, look into templating, jquery.tmpm, handlebars and mustache.js
[07:27:47] <blackspotwiggins> jquery.tmpl even
[07:28:11] <zatan> blackspotwiggins,  cheers looking good :)
[07:28:49] <tcial> I have 2 problems with some jQuery I've got
[07:29:00] <tcial> One of them is, I can't animate a text shadow for some reason
[07:29:06] <tcial> and also, animations happen at odd times
[07:29:07] <tcial> http://jsfiddle.net/85fVB/
[07:29:43] <jtrick> majd: Yeah, I personally would do that
[07:30:00] <majd> jtrick: great - thanks for the confirmation.
[07:30:14] <tcial> I want it so that the shadow appears to stay in the same place, whilst the text moves upwards, to give a 3D effect. If there is a better way, please inform me.
[07:30:23] <jtrick> You could use the class to group all of your products if you need to perform batch operations on them
[07:30:42] <jtrick> and specify individual ids with id
[07:30:53] <jtrick> np
[07:33:14] <jtrick_> Is anyone here familiar with the internals of jQueryUI?
[07:34:26] <stuffmc> Say I have 4 divs with the same class
[07:34:45] <stuffmc> how can I with one jQ sector select index 1,2,3
[07:35:06] <stuffmc> kind of ".class:eq(1)" but with 1,2,3 -- trying not to make a loop
[07:35:16] <mattfield> tcial: I'm pretty sure you can't animate text-shadow with .animate()
[07:35:27] <tcial> Oh :S
[07:35:46] <blackspotwiggins> ?:lte() @ stuffmc
[07:35:51] <bot-t> stuffmc, :gt() Selector - Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[07:35:55] <mattfield> That's why the text-shadow jumps straight from 4px vertical offset to 9px when the animation is complete
[07:35:56] <blackspotwiggins> ehh
[07:35:59] <blackspotwiggins> close enough
[07:36:30] <mattfield> tcial: try using a CSS3 transition instead
[07:36:37] <tcial> Something like WebKit?
[07:37:07] <mattfield> like transition: .5s text-shadow ease-in-out;
[07:37:09] <tcial> I want to have a text effect, similar to the effect on boxes here
[07:37:10] <tcial> http://endtwist.github.com/kerning.js/
[07:37:10] <blackspotwiggins> tcial, just use classes with desired properties
[07:37:24] <blackspotwiggins> and add transition: all .5s;
[07:37:26] <blackspotwiggins> with prefixes
[07:37:29] <mattfield> yep, exactly
[07:37:52] <mattfield> switch classes rather than animating css properties. good idea to keep css out of your JS as much as possible
[07:38:10] <stuffmc> thanks blackspotwiggins!
[07:38:11] <LSshock> Hi everyone, i'm trying to use nextUntil() in a more simple test it can find the IDs but in the real test it fails
[07:38:11] <LSshock> http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/5/ Â the IDs are there but nothing happens
[07:38:31] <stuffmc> ?:lt() is actually what I needed :D
[07:38:32] <bot-t> stuffmc, :first Selector - http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[07:38:47] <tcial> So, how do you reccomend doing all the of the animation, including moving the text upwards?
[07:38:50] <stuffmc> no, bot :) lt, not first :D
[07:40:40] <mattfield> add the vendor prefixed transition: .5s text-shadow linear to the element, set up another class with the declarations you want to use (so, increased displacement of text-shadow, margin etc), then use jQ to toggleClass() on hover.
[07:41:14] <tcial> mattfield: Wut
[07:41:35] <mattfield> tcial: bearing in mind that the effect on http://endtwist.github.com/kerning.js/ that you're trying to replicate uses multiple text-shadows
[07:41:47] <tcial> Oh xD
[07:42:01] <tcial> I just want to have it so that, when you hover, it looks like it sticks out the page.
[07:42:13] <tcial> The shadow would stay in the same place, and the text would move upwards, ideally
[07:42:43] <mattfield> well http://endtwist.github.com/kerning.js/ uses a translate3d property for the animation, and just adds a load more shadows
[07:42:53] <tcial> Yeah
[07:43:00] <tcial> Is there a simpler way?
[07:43:34] <mattfield> not really. I'd rely more on CSS3 and classes for something like this rather than forcing presentation with jQuery
[07:43:55] <tcial> Ok. I just need a simple way of doing it. Do I need to use webkit?
[07:44:03] <mattfield> if needs be, just duplicate the way they've done it on http://endtwist.github.com/kerning.js/
[07:44:12] <mattfield> you need to use the vendor prefixes
[07:44:21] <mattfield> so -webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, -o-
[07:45:12] <mattfield> text-shadow doesn't need to be prefixed, but the translate3d does
[07:45:42] <tcial> translate3d and stuff like that confuses me >_<
[07:45:58] <tcial> Can you do any example code please?
[07:46:03] <mattfield> sure, give me a sec
[07:46:38] <tcial> Thanks :D

[08:03:43] <zim> wow what a time to join #jquery its got fruity in here :-)
[08:07:03] <granden> shoky: Probably a stupid question, but is it possible to get the original width?

[08:09:20] <tcial> I have that code, how do I get the append to put the ! inside the tag
[08:09:30] <tcial> As it currently puts it outside the LI tag, messing up my CSS
[08:10:29] <Gho5t> I'm using templates in javascript and the library I'm using has its own syntax for creating comments. I'm wondering why should I use template comments over plain old javascript comments
[08:10:45] <aclockworkpeter> hello everyone
[08:10:54] <mattfield> tcial: like this http://jsfiddle.net/X6eqn/1/
[08:11:31] <mattfield> you don't have to wrap the "<b>!</b>" in the jQuery object
[08:11:59] <tcial> mattfield: The problem is, that appends it after the </li>
[08:12:09] <tcial> I want it to be put IN the <li>Hello</li> tag
[08:12:37] <aclockworkpeter> i have a problem
[08:12:42] <granden> shoky: .width() reports 0 but the image is clearly not 0 in width as I can see it :)
[08:12:52] <faraway> tcial: in which browser ?  chase here it is inside
[08:13:00] <aclockworkpeter> for some reason, the quantity is going underneath the total cost... http://pastie.org/4372021
[08:13:07] <mattfield> tcial: it is putting it inside the <li>
[08:13:12] <tcial> Oh wait >_<
[08:13:17] <tcial> <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
[08:13:18] <mattfield> that's what append() does
[08:13:24] <tcial> I need it to go inside the <a> tag >_<
[08:13:26] <shoky> granden: you ran .width() on the img element?
[08:13:27] <aclockworkpeter> i'm using jquery mobile...
[08:13:28] <tcial> <derp>
[08:14:25] <faraway> tcial: $(this).find("a").append
[08:14:56] <granden> shoky: I added a id to the element and then, so yes.
[08:15:04] <granden> But i found I should use the document.load not document.ready
[08:15:27] <granden> So now it reports the correct with and height.
[08:15:30] <shoky> yeap
[08:15:52] <shoky> you could also .load on the img itself
[08:16:08] <granden> $('#img').load.width()?
[08:16:18] <granden> () on the load.
[08:16:48] <shoky> $('#img').load(function() { originalWidth = $(this).width(); ... })
[08:16:49] <granden> shoky: But does not really mather as this way works. But is there something similair to retrive the acctuall file width?
[08:16:57] <shoky> ^^
[08:16:59] <granden> oh that gets the original with :)
[08:17:22] <shoky> well, on an img tag that doesnt have its size set, i guess
[08:17:46] <granden> this img thag has either width or height set in a style tag using css.
[08:18:01] <granden> but otherwise, could I get the original size any other way?
[08:18:02] <shoky> then i think you'll get that size
[08:18:03] <granden> That would not mather.
[08:18:05] <shoky> not the original
[08:18:08] <fredric> how can i use off() if i have a custom function in on()? like .on("keydown", function(event) { CustomHandler(event) }); (do i need to wrap it in "function(){}" to get the event?)
[08:18:16] <granden> so how to get original file size?
[08:18:22] <granden> when something is set.
[08:18:24] <shoky> put it in an img tag with no size set..
[08:18:30] <tcial> faraway: Thanks :D
[08:18:48] <granden> shoky: But then I would get two images on my site, dont want that, or what?
[08:19:36] <hoolter> Why can't I make this alias? var log = console.log; log('foo');
[08:20:30] <mattfield> fredic: just call .off(). All the handlers will be unbound
[08:20:57] <fredric> i dont want that, i want only that handler to unbind
[08:21:00] <fredric> http://pastebin.com/D995iHmf <- this is my code
[08:21:15] <fredric> line 19 won't unbind
[08:22:36] <mattfield> abstract the event into a separate function and pass that in instead
[08:23:19] <fredric> how do you mean?
[08:24:02] <mattfield> take the "keydown" callback, so function(e) { CancelReport(e, report) };, and create a separate function, like var keydownFunc = function(e) { CancelReport(e, report) };
[08:24:17] <mattfield> then do .off("keydown", keydownFunc);
[08:24:37] <faraway> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/P8dnD/
[08:25:05] <mattfield> even though the .on() and .off() do the same thing in reverse, they are created separately and so are set up as distinct function objects
[08:26:32] <shoky> granden: put display:none on it
[08:27:18] <RyChiss> Hey can someone tell me how to add  unique class to each <span> that is made in my code? http://jsfiddle.net/9Mrer/
[08:27:20] <mattfield> fredric: obviously make sure it's bound using .on("keydown", keydownFunc) too
[08:28:21] <fredric> yes but how will i be able to pass in my report-variable then?
[08:29:43] <dabear> RyChiss: simple... http://jsfiddle.net/9Mrer/1/
[08:30:37] <fredric> if i put that variable outside the first scope it wont have report, and i if put it in it the CancelReport won't have the variable
[08:30:57] <RyChiss> @dabear thanks a lot. One more thing, can I use the word that is being surrounded by the <span> as the name of the class
[08:30:59] <RyChiss> ?
[08:31:19] <dabear> RyChiss: sure but why
[08:31:51] <RyChiss> makes for easier recognition of the words I want to work with
[08:32:05] <dabear> use v instead of i
[08:32:56] <RyChiss> dabear - thanks much
[08:33:12] <fredric> mattfield how would i be able to use the var in both scopes?
[08:34:22] <mattfield> use $.proxy
[08:34:39] <mattfield> fredric: use $.proxy http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[08:35:15] <fredric> will check
[08:36:17] <shoky> fredric just use event namespaces
[08:36:50] <shoky> $(document).on('keydown.mystuff', function...);    then   $(document).off('keydown.mystuff') or $(document).off('.mystuff');
[08:37:36] <mattfield> that's a better idea!
[08:38:00] <fredric> thxs
[08:39:04] <fredric> works perfect, thanks a lot
[08:46:48] <zoned> var options = {callback: function() { alert("it worked"); }}; $("#somediv").animate({height: 500px}, {complete: options.callback});         can someone tell me why this doesn't work?
[08:48:15] <faraway> zoned: if this is a copy and past it has a sytax error
[08:48:29] <mattfield> it should just be $('#somediv').animate({height: "500px"}, options.callback);
[08:48:30] <faraway> zoned: cause of the  500px
[08:48:58] <zoned> faraway, hmm... the animate actually works and the height is correct. its the callback thats not firing
[08:49:21] <faraway> zoned: then make a jsfiddle example
[08:49:39] <zoned> faraway, actually i'm passing height as a variable, so it is a string
[08:50:13] <zoned> so just make it options.callback instead of {complete: options.callback} ?
[08:50:18] <mattfield> yep
[08:51:21] <quicksilver> {complete: options.callback} should work though.
[08:52:24] <gyzmodo> is it possible to hide placeholder value with jquery?
[08:53:06] <faraway> zoned: ther must be another problem: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/S6ENe/  because this works
[08:54:11] <ansolas> nice
[08:54:35] <ansolas> its more entertaining to follow this channel here than watching tv
[08:54:49] <ansolas> :)
[08:55:08] <zoned> ... wth.
[08:55:15] <zoned> hmm
[08:55:21] <ansolas> ?
[08:55:29] <RyChiss> dabear - I've tried the code that works fine in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/9Mrer/3/, but it isn't doing anything on my site - can you see what i may be doing wrong? http://sa.eyeink.com/go
[08:57:36] <zoned> hahah... if (options.cabllack) { $el.animate({height: height}, {complete: options.callback});
[08:57:56] <dabear> RyChiss: jquery is not loaded
[08:58:01] <MINTTU> how can i select the first span after an id and then input html into <span></span> ?
[08:58:12] <faraway> RyChiss: jquery is loaded with noConflict
[08:58:37] <faraway> RyChiss: so you need to use jQuery instead of $
[08:59:00] <RyChiss> faraway ah hah... will make the edit
[08:59:21] <MINTTU> $("#{$fname[1]} span")
[08:59:44] <MINTTU> will that select the first span after {$fname[1] ?
[09:00:33] <dabear> MINTTU: it will select all the spans below that id
[09:00:35] <NoiseEee> MINTTU: if only you could test that somehow!!!!
[09:00:51] <dabear> NoiseEee++
[09:00:52] <MINTTU> NoiseEee: hehe
[09:00:54] <MINTTU> didnt work
[09:00:55] <MINTTU> ;)
[09:01:17] <NoiseEee> well {$fname[1]} is a funny ID, sure thats your ID?
[09:01:27] <MINTTU> its in php
[09:01:36] <MINTTU> under echo <<<EOD
[09:01:37] <MINTTU> :P
[09:01:37] <LindsayMac> Gates:  ever get that animation sorted out?
[09:01:40] <MINTTU> thats wy
[09:02:15] <Gates> sorta
[09:02:18] <LindsayMac> ?
[09:02:29] <Gates> waiting for legal to approve it
[09:02:54] <LindsayMac> legal?
[09:02:56] <NoiseEee> MINTTU: http://api.jquery.com/first/
[09:02:57] <zim> Are there any good ref for working with jquery mobile? in an ideal world a sample site with doc.
[09:03:03] <MINTTU> NoiseEee: +1
[09:03:12] <LindsayMac> zim:  i found very little on the topic..
[09:03:24] <MINTTU> apparently $("#{$fname[1]} ~ span:first") works :P
[09:03:26] <Gates> LindsayMac: yes its for a big company
[09:03:44] <LindsayMac> Gates:  but did you get the animation working...
[09:03:45] <Gates> LindsayMac: let me fix the jsfiddler on the rouf
[09:03:49] <Gates> yes
[09:03:52] <Gates> its okay
[09:03:54] <LindsayMac> Cool...
[09:03:55] <zim> Thanks LindsayMac it looks geat but a little mor doc would be great
[09:04:21] <zim> s/mor/more
[09:04:26] <LindsayMac> zim:  i actually found it to not be so great and went with a simple swipe.js (not jquery) and traditional jquery "stuff"
[09:05:02] <RyChiss> faraway - I changed the $ to jQuery and it is still not working
[09:05:06] <zim> Thanks for the heads up where where the problems?
[09:05:48] <faraway> RyChiss: you didn't change all ;)
[09:06:19] <LindsayMac> zim:  it's very inflexible from what I could see. The specific issues I had was with how they build the pages. It's a typical single page site design where your page content is on one page, but I had a heck of a time working out links to the pages versus swipes, and there were some other little issues I can't remember off the top of my head
[09:06:20] <RyChiss> faraway: are you saying I missed one?
[09:06:29] <faraway> RyChiss: yes
[09:06:34] <LindsayMac> zim:  also, I am new to JS... but not coding
[09:06:40] <AndChat641136> Hello room
[09:06:47] <Gates> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[09:06:49] <LindsayMac> So take it for what it's worth, but others have expressed similar opinions
[09:07:01] <LindsayMac> Gates:  That is VERY cool..
[09:07:15] <Gates> hopefully it captures the eye
[09:07:20] <faraway> RyChiss: but if you preffer the $  you can always do something link this http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9Mrer/4/
[09:07:22] <LindsayMac> Gates:  thanks for sharing the outcome. I was really curious how it would work out
[09:07:24] <Gates> ill pm you the live site if youd like when we take it live
[09:07:32] <Gates> (prob later today)
[09:07:40] <LindsayMac> sure why not
[09:07:51] <faraway> RyChiss: sorry forgot that i could have told you that
[09:08:03] <Gates> LindsayMac: i was trying to figure out wehre i know u, it must be wp
[09:08:05] <Gates> channel
[09:08:05] <zim> LindsayMac: kind of where I am at with it. I tend to try keep the js to a minimum and so the clever stuff server side but it seems to make live hard doing it that way.
[09:08:05] <RyChiss> faraway: testing now
[09:08:26] <Gates> zim: me too but i do what i am told at work lol
[09:08:35] <Gates> not enough sign ups? animate the button! ..i guess lol
[09:08:36] <LindsayMac> Gates:  AHHHH yes.. I am in there often. Wordpress / php is my main languages...
[09:08:42] <Gates> LindsayMac: same
[09:09:15] <JFranks> Hmmm .. I have a button that I need to be 'pressed' based on user prefs that are passed to the page with PHP (pulling from MySQL) if I load it with a 'checked' class it mucks with the button.. I'm thinking I need a different class, like pref_checked, and trigger [SOMETHING] when the page loads and sees that class on an item?
[09:09:28] <JFranks> Need help with the [SOMETHING] mostly.. ;)
[09:09:30] <faraway> RyChiss: and another thing, the script is executed before the element exists
[09:09:33] <LindsayMac> zim: what are you trying to do with jqm? If it's simple page swipes / structure, i did find that swipe.js ultimately was good... after i figured out what he was doing in the example (with some help)
[09:09:46] <Gates> LindsayMac: trying to wrap my head around more OO PHP as i dont do my due diligence
[09:10:11] <Gates> i get the OO just no time to read into MVC deeper then concepts
[09:10:20] <zim> I like to have one jquery/function do loads of stuff using data-* to then control the outcome. save having miles of js
[09:10:24] <faraway> RyChiss: either move the code behind the html element or use the ready event for the dom
[09:10:45] <MINTTU> folks, im not very familiar with the syntax in jQuery yet. If i've declared a variable ( var img = "..."; ) How can use it in $.append("<img src='images/var' />");
[09:10:48] <RyChiss> faraway: works now ;-)
[09:10:54] <LindsayMac> zim: jqm does that.. but only within it's own limits.
[09:11:07] <zim> jqm?
[09:11:19] <LindsayMac> Gates: yea.. it took me a whole to get into that and I'm still just learning, but thats a chat for a different channel
[09:11:20] <zim> got it Doh
[09:11:25] <LindsayMac> zim:  JqueryMobile
[09:11:26] <LindsayMac> lol
[09:11:27] <Gates> lol
[09:12:27] <zim> Yes but it is not very good at bring new content into the same page it likes to have it all produced and rendered at once.
[09:13:18] <zim> It may be that I am doing it wrong but cant find and good clear (This is how you should do it doc)
[09:14:25] <LindsayMac> zim:  MOST mobile sites, as I can tell, use the one page concept
[09:14:43] <LindsayMac> zim:  if you aren't using the one page content, then just don't use the aspect of jqm that does the swipe effect
[09:15:37] <faraway> MINTTU: probably you should think of learning the basics of javascript first
[09:17:23] <zim> My first bug was (Search box) on->keyup populate a  list view but the list view has all kinds of jquery magic that get applied onload so any new content is not styled
[09:23:17] <benniestacks> Hello everyone
[09:23:25] * ktstowell waves
[09:24:41] <benniestacks> I'm really new to jquery and am more familar with php/html is there an easy way to parse a JSON feed with jquery?
[09:26:22] <zim> benniestacks: $.parseJSON(data);
[09:26:53] <benniestacks> I found this example http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ but my JSON feed isn't setup the same as a flickr feed
[09:27:33] <asura> I'm having a scoping issue getting the data out of the $.post callback, related to this code: http://pastebin.com/KD7GzXRe
[09:28:12] <zim> benniestacks: is you json from an array?
[09:28:49] <benniestacks> Hey Zim, It from a JSON feed here http://login.netswagger.com/feeds/?function=get_services
[09:29:51] <asura> I'm trying to use $.post from within a select event, but I'm having trouble getting the data out of the $.post callback into my select event.
[09:34:01] <benniestacks> zim: do you think that kind of feed can be parsed by jquery?
[09:34:47] <DarkGhost`> Hello everyone, I have a weird problem that I have no clue how to debug, so I was wondering if you guys could help me out. http://devcollective.net/wordpress/portfolio-2/ If you go to this page, you can roll over the images and it will slidedown or right, once you click a category and it rearranges the images, all javascript stops working. the rollover doesn't work, I can't even get an alert
[09:34:47] <DarkGhost`> to work for the rollover. Please help.
[09:34:48] <ktstowell> asura:  is the console saying that 'data' isn't defined or that 'event' isn't defined?
[09:35:07] <chrisbc> When I type mysite.com/#something it's suppose to open tab called #something and set display to bookmarked position, why doesn't this work if I add jquery (using accordion)?
[09:36:13] <hazamonzo_> hey folks. how can i detect an unfocus? I have a textarea that i want to fire a function after the user clicks out of the text area box. If that makes sense?
[09:37:02] <ktstowell> asura: http://jsfiddle.net/nB8rV/ try that
[09:38:38] <benniestacks> Hello Everyone,
[09:38:38] <benniestacks> How can I get jquery to parse my json feed from http://login.netswagger.com/feeds/?function=get_services ? I'm trying to develop an app with display the information in thise feed but I have hit a brick wall on this one. Any help woud be REALLY appreciated
[09:45:32] <benniestacks> I've also tried this http://jsfiddle.net/netswagger/VV54B/2/ with no luck. I'm just not sure how that type of feed can be parsed
[09:47:38] <ktstowell> are you console logging data to see what the exact structure of teh return object is?
[09:48:45] <benniestacks> ktstowell: I'm not quite sure how to do that. I'm more of a php/html5 devloper
[09:49:08] <rmurphey> benniestacks: fixingthesejquery.com
[09:49:22] <ktstowell> inside of function(data) { console.log(data)}
[09:49:31] <ktstowell> then open up the browser's dev console
[09:49:39] <ktstowell> i reccomend chrome's
[09:50:50] <benniestacks> ktstowell: Thanks! I'm going to give that a try now
[09:51:00] <ktstowell> sure thing
[09:51:12] <benniestacks> rmurphey: thank you too
[09:52:01] <LindsayMac> benniestacks: your fiddle was using mootools not JQ?
[09:52:23] <ktstowell> he prolly just set up to paste and didnt configure it
[09:52:27] <ktstowell> nothing actually running
[09:52:37] <LindsayMac> ahh ok .
[09:52:39] <RyChiss> hi - I would like for elements with the class "highl" to receive the "highlighted" class when clicked, and then when the element is clicked again, the "highlighted" class should be removed" - http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/4/
[09:53:47] <LindsayMac> Does fancybox generally not work inside of a jsfiddle?
[09:53:48] <NodeX> you dont have any elements with high1 classname
[09:54:17] <ktstowell> oh also benniestacks you're prolly gonna run into same-origin restrictions
[09:54:22] <benniestacks> LindsayMac: yea I just pasted my sorces in there. But am developing localy
[09:55:31] <NodeX> RyChiss : http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/8/
[09:56:10] <benniestacks> ktstowell: would the id not fix the same-origan issue or is that somthing else?
[09:56:25] <sunbeam> any reason why i cannot use var myvar = "test"; myvar = myvar.replace("test","something");
[09:56:44] <RyChiss> NodeX: thanks much
[09:57:01] <sunbeam> i get myvar is undefined
[09:57:06] <ktstowell> bennie it wouldn't fix it, most borwsers don't let you make ajax requests to different domains due to gaping security holes
[09:57:34] <ktstowell> you need to use a proxy or auth service depending on the API of teh service you're trying to reach
[09:57:47] <DarkGhost`> Hello everyone, I have a weird problem that I have no clue how to debug, so I was wondering if you guys could help me out. http://devcollective.net/wordpress/portfolio-2/ If you go to this page, you can roll over the images and it will slidedown or right, once you click a category and it rearranges the images, all javascript stops working. the rollover doesn't work, I can't even get an alert
[09:57:47] <DarkGhost`> to work for the rollover. Please help.
[09:57:53] <benniestacks> oh ok
[09:58:20] <ktstowell> jsut search on stack overflow for creating web service proxies or ajax proxies
[09:58:37] <ktstowell> or if the services you're trying to support uses oauth2 or something
[09:59:20] <hazamonzo_> Folks. whats a good jquery validation library?
[09:59:31] <hazamonzo_> form validation that is
[10:00:25] <ktstowell> beta.epic-validator.com will be! lol - a few months out yet.
[10:00:38] <hazamonzo_> :s
[10:00:41] <DarkGhost`> this sucks
[10:00:43] <DarkGhost`> im desperate
[10:00:59] <hazamonzo_> DarkGhost`: you'll find a girl one day. I promise
[10:01:09] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: are you using a plugin?
[10:01:44] <LindsayMac> Who was th eguy with the click / highlights ???
[10:01:55] <LindsayMac> RyChiss:  http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/4/
[10:02:19] <NodeX> [17:55:22] <NodeX> RyChiss : http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/8/
[10:02:27] <NodeX> fixed 10 minutes ago
[10:02:40] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: are you currently editing the site?
[10:02:41] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  well.. I learned in the process of fixing.. so thats all that matters to me
[10:02:46] <LindsayMac> :/
[10:02:47] <lathan> NodeX, although his rev number is smaller....lol
[10:02:48] <DarkGhost`> mattfield yeah, I am sorry.
[10:02:50] <DarkGhost`> I stopped.
[10:02:59] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: jQuery is called with noConflict();
[10:03:01] <NodeX> rev number?
[10:03:10] <lathan> the last number at the end of the jsfiddle url
[10:03:11] <NodeX> by the time I pressed update it gave me "8"
[10:03:16] <lathan>  /4/ and /8/
[10:03:17] <mattfield> getting a console error that $ is being used but doesn't refer to anything
[10:03:18] <lathan> yep
[10:03:22] <lathan> it doesn't tell everything...
[10:03:25] <NodeX> that "4" was the original authors number
[10:03:27] <DarkGhost`> mattfield, refresh I stopped messing wiht it
[10:03:29] <lathan> but everytime you save it updates
[10:03:41] <lathan> which means that LindsayMac didn't save....
[10:03:41] <chrisbc> When I type mysite.com/#something it's suppose to open tab called #something and set display to bookmarked position, why doesn't this work if I add jquery (using accordion)?
[10:03:48] <LindsayMac> OHHH oops
[10:04:11] <LindsayMac> here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/3R2Pg/12/
[10:04:11] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: well that solved that partâ€¦ :)
[10:04:14] <LindsayMac> just for fun..
[10:04:17] <lathan> lol
[10:04:24] <johnkpaul> NodeX: were you asking for this earlier? http://joshondesign.com/2012/07/24/deepdivegithub
[10:04:29] <DarkGhost`> mattfield, yeah that wasn't the problem, that was just me messing around. the problem is when you swithc categories, nothing works with jquery anymore
[10:04:32] <DarkGhost`> .hover, alert's nothing
[10:04:44] <NodeX> LindsayMac : use $(this) inside the click
[10:04:49] <LindsayMac> I was so excited that I got something to work..
[10:04:53] <NodeX> no need for another lookup ;)
[10:04:55] <RyChiss> LindsayMac: thanks! this is what i used http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/13/
[10:05:00] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: are you using a plugin for the hovers?
[10:05:21] <lathan> chrisbc, if you would read the manual...you would know that jquery ui accordion doesn't impliment that feature, ?see accordion
[10:05:26] <LindsayMac> thanks for sharing and NodeX thanks for looking. It's the best way I know how to learn which is to solve problems or watch how others solve them
[10:05:34] <NodeX> johnkpaul : kind of - I got it sorted in the end
[10:05:36] <DarkGhost`> mattfield, I honestly don't know what it's using. it's a wordpress theme and I still havn't figured out whats making it hovering.
[10:05:37] <lathan> ah...bot is off again
[10:05:44] <johnkpaul> NodeX: oh ok, good
[10:05:48] <lathan> chrisbc, rtm: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:06:01] <lathan> chrisbc, no option about hashtag navigation
[10:06:14] <NodeX> LindsayMac : when you attach a bind to anything .. inside the function $(this) is always the element that was clicked / hovered or w/e
[10:06:24] <LindsayMac> NodeX: i amd still trying to learn the proper use of $(this)
[10:06:43] <LindsayMac> but you just explained it in the perfect way!!! You triggered a lightbulb! NodeX
[10:06:45] <LindsayMac> thanks for tht
[10:06:46] <NodeX> it can be confusing at first
[10:06:49] <lathan> NodeX, no, this is always the element that was matched that the event occured on
[10:06:56] <LindsayMac> uh oh
[10:07:02] <lathan> NodeX, if the event propogated then event.target is the true event
[10:07:05] <DarkGhost`> mattfield if you could help me find that, I would appreciate that. but even if I do my own .hover(){ alert(1); } that doesn't work either after categories
[10:07:08] <lathan> *element
[10:07:08] <NodeX> this is just that .. it;s "this" the current element
[10:07:18] <NodeX> lathan : that's what I said
[10:07:26] <LindsayMac> i think you're boyh saying the same thing
[10:07:36] <lathan> NodeX, oh....that didn't sound like the same thing
[10:07:36] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile 1.2.0 Alpha Released! New popup widget, collapsible listviews and autodividers, design tweaks, fixes. http://t.co/B5x31FBg â˜… http://bit.ly/R8Vcp4
[10:07:40] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  just said it in a more dumb downed way.. for my benefit
[10:07:56] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: wish I could be of more help, but there's a lot there to debug. nothing obvious. it looks like what's controlling the hover effect is in the massive block of inline JS at the top of the markup
[10:08:04] <NodeX> in an each() .. this = the current itterate
[10:08:26] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  that makes sense..
[10:08:28] <NodeX> in a function / method call this mostly means the current object
[10:08:32] <DarkGhost`> mattfield, no I did all of the inline JS. it's not there. that controls the categories, but anywhere in that inline js does it look like it would stop other javascript code?
[10:08:33] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: are there any forums/issue trackers for the company/person who you got the wordpress plugin from?
[10:08:36] <LindsayMac> I get using looks and stuff.. being that I know php.
[10:08:43] <NodeX> in a plugin it always refers to the current object
[10:08:45] <RyChiss> NodeX: Do you know how I can get the spaces in my text show up again? http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/14/
[10:08:45] <DarkGhost`> because after     	$('.portfolio-main li').click(function(e) { is called
[10:08:48] <DarkGhost`> it doesn't work
[10:08:55] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  whats the plugin you are using?
[10:08:56] <lathan> NodeX, okay...so we mean the same thing...but the behavior is demonstrated in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/XVW85/
[10:09:11] <lathan> event.target is often different than this
[10:10:12] <asura> ktstowell: Sorry I got waylaid. The self trick didn't work. The console is saying that event isn't defined.. well it actually is defined but it's an event object  from a different scope. It's saying it has no method setID.
[10:10:20] <DarkGhost`> LindsayMac: no plugin I'm using. http://devcollective.net/wordpress/portfolio-2/ after you click on category, the hover on images dont work
[10:10:59] <NodeX> lathan : this != $(this);
[10:11:10] <NodeX> this is the element ... $(this) is an Objetc;
[10:11:13] <NodeX> Object *
[10:11:13] <lathan> NodeX, correct. I wasn't saying that
[10:11:27] <NodeX> then  comparing the 2 is confusing
[10:11:39] <lathan> comparing this and event.target?
[10:11:48] <NodeX> no
[10:11:54] <lathan> that's what I was meaning
[10:12:09] <NodeX> I wasn't ever reffering to "this"
[10:12:14] <NodeX> I reffered to $(this);
[10:12:15] <LindsayMac> lol
[10:12:23] <NodeX> forget it, I cba to have this conversation
[10:12:27] <LindsayMac> lathan:  we were talking about $(this)
[10:12:45] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  either way.. thanks. You helped me to "get it"
[10:12:51] <lathan> LindsayMac, NodeX same thing....but yes...not worth an argument
[10:12:51] <NodeX> no probs
[10:12:57] <lathan> "virtually"
[10:13:15] <asura> anyone have any suggestions for accessing the event object within the scope of the callback for $.post, in this code: http://pastebin.com/KD7GzXRe?
[10:13:18] <DarkGhost`> :(
[10:13:31] <NodeX> because events bubble you can get the "clicked" element and the element it was meant to trigger on ala lathan's method
[10:13:36] <MistuhKurtz> bad link as
[10:13:37] <MistuhKurtz> asura
[10:14:00] <MistuhKurtz> asura, you pass it as an argument to the callback func
[10:14:18] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  what is the selector you are using to trigger that hover effect.. and in return, are you changing that possibly with the other script?
[10:14:21] <MistuhKurtz> function(event){ event.preventDefault; }
[10:14:30] <lathan> of course now its better to use on which does the delegation for you and correctly sets this (am I right NodeX?)
[10:14:35] <NodeX> <a id="foo"><span id="bar">Click</span></a> .. clicking on "bar" will give $(this) as the span and event.target as the #foo
[10:14:51] <lathan> NodeX, no...opposite
[10:14:53] <NodeX> or the other way round
[10:14:57] <DarkGhost`> LindsayMac: IT's a wordpress theme, so I'm not sure what is triggering that hover effect, I can't find it. but besides that, If I try to make my own hover effect, it doesn't work after that function is called.
[10:15:00] <NodeX> I never delegate that way
[10:15:07] <DarkGhost`> and It's not changing the class name or anything with another script
[10:15:08] <lathan> the event.target is always the original element
[10:15:19] <asura> MistukKurtz: the argument for the callback is where $.post stores the data from the server response, isn't it?
[10:15:20] <lathan> this is what element you selected
[10:15:20] <NodeX> I dont use jquery in that way
[10:15:29] <shoky> asura: add var before : event = { ...  ,  and also don't call it event
[10:15:30] <NodeX> I bind to what I bind to end of story
[10:15:31] <lathan> NodeX, you are saying you don't use event delegation?
[10:15:46] <lathan> hope you don't have dynamically added elements or a large number of binds.....
[10:15:56] <NodeX> and why is that?
[10:16:18] <ericelliott> NodeX: It can cause memory leaks, instability, unresponsive UI...
[10:16:39] <ericelliott> NodeX: Event delegation is the only way to go with dynamic collections.
[10:16:49] <NodeX> eh?
[10:17:06] <NodeX> what do you think I am doing? .. uding onclick="" ?
[10:17:09] <NodeX> using *
[10:17:12] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  does this theme work out of the box? Or did you get it and it was borked
[10:17:34] <asura> shoky: I implemented those suggestions, but the scope issue remains.
[10:17:42] <DarkGhost`> LindsayMac I edited it, ther wasn't suppose to be themes with 4 columns and I made it work
[10:17:48] <DarkGhost`> but the only problem is that the hover effect doesn't work
[10:17:50] <DarkGhost`> and I'm going to cry.
[10:17:58] <shoky> asura: can you paste the new code
[10:18:02] <MistuhKurtz> asura, the event should be one of the parameters passed in the callback
[10:18:02] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  but it works with the original number of columns?
[10:18:25] <NodeX> ericelliott , lathan : I think you have misunderstood me
[10:18:38] <NodeX> I delegate but I dont go looking for things with event.target
[10:19:07] <shoky> MistuhKurtz he doesn't want to access an event object that's passed to an event handler, just his own custom object that he happened to call 'event'
[10:19:16] <DarkGhost`> LindsayMac yes.
[10:19:20] <asura> http://pastebin.com/KZVXwzCh
[10:19:32] <MistuhKurtz> shoky, lool
[10:19:39] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  go back to what it was and then step by step make your changes and see where it breaks.
[10:20:04] <DarkGhost`> I know where it breaks!
[10:20:09] <DarkGhost`> it breaks after     	$('.portfolio-main li').click(function(e) { is called
[10:20:09] <LindsayMac> tell me
[10:20:11] <shoky> asura: let me guess, 2 works but 3 doesn't
[10:20:17] <shoky> asura: and you are upset
[10:20:21] <DarkGhost`> after you click on category, and that function is called and all of that stuff happenms
[10:20:22] <DarkGhost`> then it breaks
[10:20:24] <LindsayMac> No I mean which CHANGE you haveto make to get it to the way you want it..
[10:20:26] <asura> shoky: correct : )
[10:20:33] <shoky> asura: $.post returns immediately
[10:20:48] <shoky> asura: use the callback for stuff you want to happen later when the request is done
[10:21:11] <DarkGhost`> impossible
[10:21:13] <shoky> asura: that's the asynchronous nature of ajax
[10:21:19] <asura> ah I see your point, 3 is executing before the callback even executes.. hmm
[10:21:22] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  the code for the hover is in http://devcollective.net/wordpress/wp-content/themes/epic/js/custom.js?ver=1.0
[10:21:23] <shoky> yap
[10:21:47] <shoky> asura: so you probably want to move the calendar.fullCalendar(..) stuff inside the callback
[10:22:02] <DarkGhost`> howqd u find that
[10:22:04] <DarkGhost`> if u dont mind em asking
[10:22:05] <shoky> well, donno if thats what you want
[10:22:15] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  i looked at your site..
[10:22:31] <DarkGhost`> I know, but Is there a way to trace it
[10:22:32] <DarkGhost`> back to that?
[10:22:34] <ericelliott> NodeX: Carry on then. I only use event.target when I'm passing the el along outside the handler scope (where you can get at it with 'this').
[10:22:35] <DarkGhost`> or did you just look through the .j's?
[10:22:44] <asura> I think I might want the calendar.fullCalendar('renderEvent',Â calEvent,Â true); inside the callback
[10:22:45] <RyChiss> Help please - I am trying to make sure there are spaces between my words. Right now the spaces in the paragraph words are disappearing: http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/14/
[10:22:51] <NodeX> which is what I said ;)
[10:23:13] <NodeX> but thanks for the permission ;)
[10:23:13] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  i dont know what you mean by a way to trace it back to that
[10:23:25] <asura> shoky: if $.post is returning immediately, then I won't ever have the calEvent.id to pass to the renderEvent on the client side.
[10:23:29] <DarkGhost`> I don't think thats the code that is for the hover
[10:23:39] <LindsayMac> ? It says it is
[10:23:44] <DarkGhost`> for the images?
[10:23:46] <shoky> asura: why never?
[10:23:50] <DarkGhost`> it doesn't say it slides to the right or down
[10:23:50] <ericelliott> NodeX: I joined the conversation late. =)
[10:23:50] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  it says "Sortable Gallery Hover"
[10:23:53] <MistuhKurtz> RyChiss, http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/word-spacing
[10:23:59] <DarkGhost`> oh
[10:24:00] <DarkGhost`> I see it
[10:24:03] <LindsayMac> ?
[10:24:04] <DarkGhost`> ur good
[10:24:05] <DarkGhost`> im sorry
[10:24:08] <DarkGhost`> your right
[10:24:09] <asura> shoky: well, I mean the client side calEvent is going to initialized with the undefined id, rather than the response from the server.
[10:24:28] <shoky> asura: then initialize it only when the ajax is done
[10:24:42] <shoky> or re-initialize or update or whatever
[10:24:47] <LindsayMac> DarkGhost`:  anyway.. that whole file is all your initializations for the scripts.
[10:25:12] <asura> shoky: yeah, I think that may actually be the solution, though it doesn't solve the scoping problem I thought I had lol
[10:25:26] <shoky> you had no scoping problem ;)
[10:25:32] <RyChiss> MistuhKurtz - Spaces already exist in the original text. I'm just trying to understand why it leaves: http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/14/
[10:25:39] <shoky> well , except for missing 'var' :P
[10:25:44] <asura> shoky: if I did have a scoping problem, how would I solve that? >< ... I thought I needed to use ES5 bind() somehow.
[10:26:00] <shoky> asura: donno what you mean... if you had WHAT scoping problem?
[10:26:15] <MistuhKurtz> RyChiss, you're splitting by a space, " "
[10:26:20] <MistuhKurtz> that removes all the spaces.
[10:27:15] <asura> shoky: well, it actually may be working with the way I have calEvent defined now.. previously I was trying to access calEvent.id without a method.. just by assigning to it, but calEvent didn't exist within the scope of the callback.
[10:27:27] <RyChiss> what's a command to add all of the spaces back?
[10:27:44] <shoky> asura: i'd have to see exactly what you're doing and what the problem is in order to answer ..
[10:27:51] <RyChiss> MistuhKurtz
[10:28:00] <lathan> RyChiss, join
[10:28:29] <shoky> asura: you don't need the methods, assigning should work fine
[10:29:38] <asura> shoky: Yeah, it's kind of confusing. Let me try moving this stuff into the callback then I might try to elaborate on the scoping problem I was having. Thanks for your help.
[10:37:50] <LindsayMac> a mass exodus
[10:40:20] <MINTTU> Hi, shouldn't: $("#{$fname[1]}").keypress(function() {
[10:40:20] <MINTTU> 	if($("#{$fname[1]}").val() == ''){
[10:40:29] <MINTTU> accept 1 char in input field?
[10:40:40] <shoky> what?
[10:40:51] <shoky> what is {$fname[1]}  ?
[10:40:56] <MINTTU> a php variable
[10:40:59] <shoky> ..
[10:41:04] <MINTTU> never mind that
[10:41:23] <MINTTU> its the val() == "" that doesnt seem to work.
[10:41:31] <Getty> i dont get it, i got a $.post(); and i dont get an error but also neither he executes it (the console.log before is, the console.log after also isnt)
[10:41:33] <shoky> what doesn't work about it
[10:42:00] <MINTTU> sec, ill use the pastebin
[10:42:04] <shoky> MINTTU: btw, you can just:  if (this.value == '') { ..
[10:42:20] <MINTTU> clever
[10:42:21] <MINTTU> :)
[10:43:39] <shoky> or if (this.value) { ..
[10:44:00] <shoky> oops  if (!this.value) {..
[10:44:45] <MINTTU> http://jsfiddle.net/KLGCG/
[10:44:50] <MINTTU> thats the code
[10:45:20] <MINTTU> When i write like "A" in the input field, i get the image of exclamation.
[10:45:35] <MINTTU> shouldnt that only appear if the field is EMPTY ?
[10:46:19] <MINTTU> if i write like "AB" then i get the accept image.
[10:46:50] <shoky> MINTTU: use keyup, not keypress
[10:46:56] <MINTTU> ok
[10:47:10] <shoky> and also dont put var definitions inside an if ..
[10:47:18] <stuffmc> Hi
[10:47:20] <NodeX> $(this).val().length >=1 ?
[10:47:29] <lathan> MINTTU, I think you want keyup
[10:47:36] <MINTTU> I'll try keyup
[10:47:37] <stuffmc> How can I search for the "val()" of a list of nodes?
[10:47:57] <stuffmc> I have a few <li> and want to select the one having the "value"    "AAAA"
[10:48:01] <lathan> stuffmc, either a special plugin, or: .each(function(){ this.val() ... })
[10:48:17] <asura> shoky: I got it working!
[10:48:20] <lathan> stuffmc, contains
[10:48:20] <shoky> $('li[value=AAAA]')
[10:48:23] <lathan> :contains
[10:48:35] <lathan> stuffmc, li:contains(AAAA)
[10:49:01] <shoky> contains is for text
[10:49:15] <lathan> shoky, stuffmc is asking for the value of an li? that is the text
[10:49:27] <stuffmc> this is awesome
[10:49:31] <shoky> dunno he said "val()" so..
[10:49:35] <shoky> i'm assuming value attribute
[10:49:36] <stuffmc> $('#clients li:contains(AAA)')
[10:49:39] <lathan> shoky, I know....never trust the customer...
[10:49:42] <shoky> ;]
[10:49:45] <lathan> they don't know what they want
[10:49:49] <stuffmc> exactly what I was looking for
[10:49:51] <stuffmc> thanks guys
[10:49:54] <lathan> stuffmc, be adviced:
[10:50:15] <shoky> i prefer to give them what they asked for so they see why it's the wrong thing to ask for ;]
[10:50:25] <lathan> :contains goes recursive...like find. fully down to the bottom. if you have <li><div id="exclude">blah</div></li> :contains(blah) will still match it
[10:50:29] <lathan> stuffmc, ^
[10:50:50] <lathan> stuffmc, and I wouldn't advice doing body:contains(...)
[10:50:59] <lathan> contains isn't super fast
[10:51:11] <stuffmc> my <li>s have only text inside
[10:51:13] <lathan> its having to do a string search of all its html
[10:51:13] <stuffmc> no other tags
[10:51:18] <lathan> then no surprises
[10:51:22] <stuffmc> of course, this can always change :) so thanks for the tip!
[10:52:01] <lathan> stuffmc, $(standards).change(panic);
[10:52:42] <stuffmc> ok folksâ€¦ got work to do, THANKS!
[10:52:49] <AnonymousPrime> anybody ever used aspects with jquery? http://code.google.com/p/jquery-aop/
[10:53:09] <F-14_Tomcat> hello, i have a sortable with items of a class, and a draggable on the same class so that they can be moved into another "parenting" type of sortable.  Trouble is, I can't get the orginal placeholder attribute to work without erratic behavior. I can only get the desired mechanics when I give both sortable/draggable "clone", but I'd like the original placeholder... I know this is probably the
[10:53:09] <F-14_Tomcat> result of calling the draggable/sortable on a common element in two different ways.  How can I rectify this?
[10:53:42] <F-14_Tomcat> here's a visual
[10:53:42] <F-14_Tomcat> http://jsfiddle.net/9WZZ4/5/
[10:53:59] <JFranks> How would I 'push' a button checkbox (http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox) object based on a class? Like if the page loads and some of the checkboxes should be checked, how do I 'push' the button?
[10:54:49] <shoky> JFranks: just like you check a checkbox
[10:55:05] <shoky> JFranks: .prop('checked',true)  or set checked attribute in the html
[10:55:09] <JFranks> shoky: Correct! .. So my PHP echoes 'checked'
[10:55:17] <JFranks> Which screws it up horribly
[10:55:23] <shoky> :\
[10:55:31] <daum> hey guys if i have somethign like $("<form><ul class='hover'></ul></form>").removeClass('hover'); my goal is to remove 'hover' class from anything with it in the string passed in.  How would i go aboutdoing this? that doesn't seem to do it
[10:55:46] <JFranks> Now how do I tell JS to look at the items for a class the PHP passed and 'press' the button?
[10:56:07] <Einzig> Hey people, This code to hide and display a div fully works. But when I implement it in a nested page it completely fails to hide and show. the css is in a general script. the js code is in the nested page and so is the html. any idea why?  http://jsbin.com/uxukof/19/edit
[10:56:29] <JFranks> so PHP will echo 'PREF_CHECKED' .. and the JS will go 'hey it has that class, I need to 'press' it' .. onload ?
[10:56:34] <danzik17> JFranks: if you're emitting <input type="checkbox" checked /> from PHP, it should be checked already when it hits the DOM.
[10:57:16] <F-14_Tomcat> correction: I'd like the placeholder to show with a clone...
[10:57:16] <shoky> JFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/nhBxq/13/
[10:58:49] <JFranks> OH .. not a 'class' just in the element?
[10:58:52] <JFranks> Grrr..
[11:00:18] <JFranks> Hmmm better.. it show it's checked, but it doesn't think it's checked until I click it
[11:00:31] <JFranks> which shows it as unchecked
[11:00:43] <JFranks> but makes the data change to a checked state..
[11:01:05] <codepython777> I've a form that my user submits to a url. The submit returns a text string from the server. I would like to display it on the form. How do I get access to the string from jquery?
[11:01:16] <JFranks> I think I can fiddle this pretty easy..
[11:02:07] <ragas> how do i get the first 3 characters of a string, like plucking the 200 out of 200px?  eg. var height = $('#branding').css('height').slice(0,2);// Doesnt do what i want.
[11:03:43] <codepython777> $('#myForm')..ajaxForm({ .. success : function(response) ... --> Does response automatically get called when the user clicks submit?
[11:04:20] <NoiseEee> codepython777: response contains the data/response sent by your server.
[11:04:35] <codepython777> NoiseEee: thanks
[11:04:44] <JFranks> Hahaha... Okay so the page was cheating and looking for a 'class' on the checkbox item and the jquery uses 'checked' inside the dom element.. So I just had PHP echo 'checked' into both the class and the main body of the element.. works.. Thanks shoky!
[11:05:29] <juha_> ragas: parseInt($('#branding').css('height'));
[11:05:33] <ragas> ok, maybe it does, nm
[11:05:54] <ragas> ahh, that looks better, thanks, juha_
[11:11:38] <HEMI> So, any tablesorter parser goons around? :/ I need to write a parser for something...I've written one before that worked well, but in this case I'm having trouble even getting started.

[11:24:15] <shoky> an html string, i assume
[11:24:19] <JFranks> LOL.. Noooope.. tying datebox to the input elements didn't help the tablesorter ... it's still sorting the table on the 'ID' values.. and doesn't reverse sort.. ?
[11:24:54] <freazy> @shoky yes
[11:25:15] <imsky> what are you bros jabberin about
[11:25:41] <shoky> qJuery
[11:25:54] <freazy> thanks shoky
[11:26:23] <JFranks> The good news is that the jQuery date dialog is loading in the exact same space as the HTML5 .. so you can click either one.. ;p

[11:29:17] <chrickso> hi all. could anyone help with this. i have a bunch of jquery running when you hover a button. what i want is to make a $('.disabled').hover(... selector catch anything with a class of disabled and prevent any other jquery for that button from running
[11:30:17] <chrickso> e.stopImmediatePropagation(); & e.stopPropagation(); are not working. i think they only stop other $('.disabled') selectors
[11:30:30] <slartsa> e.preventDefault();
[11:31:09] <shoky> neither
[11:31:26] <chrickso> that doesn't work either. that just prevents the default behavior. i want to stop jquery from executing anything else altogether
[11:31:33] <shoky> if ( $(this).hasClass('disabled') ) return;
[11:31:38] <codepython777> I had a link with a lot of plugins that would demo on a page (all written using jquery). Anyone has the link to that page. I lost the link
[11:32:01] <chrickso> shoky: ya, i'm looking to prevent having to type that in every place that button is selected
[11:32:50] <HEMI> Can't use a good selector to get them all?

[11:54:03] <Sample> Q: Does anyone have the issue in which, when setting Event Listener breakpoints in the Chrome debugging environment (which is very good), a breakpoint on something like "click" will not show where the click originated (or allow you to "step out") but rather shows you the actual click handing code of the jquery library
[11:54:15] <Sample> anyone figured out a way to deal with this?
[11:59:29] <lathan> Sample, put the breakpoint in your function handler, not on the .click line

[12:06:47] <dogarrhea2> ok
[12:06:52] <dogarrhea2> eval on a settimeout works
[12:07:01] <dogarrhea2> and on a setinterval too.
[12:07:16] <LindsayMac> :nth child() stuffmc .. i think
[12:07:57] <LindsayMac> stuffmc:  http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[12:08:06] <stuffmc> that's the other way around :)
[12:08:13] <stuffmc> I won't to know which "nth" it is :)
[12:08:45] <LindsayMac> Ahh so you need to select it and THEN count the total children in it's parent and see which one it is?
[12:08:49] <stuffmc> I could do a loop and compare
[12:08:56] <stuffmc> yeah
[12:09:01] <stuffmc> well I have it selected
[12:09:11] <stuffmc> it's a $(this) in a click handler
[12:09:29] <stuffmc> and there's 4 times ".button"
[12:09:42] <stuffmc> so I want to know if it's #1, 2, 3, 4 that was clicked
[12:09:48] <stuffmc> (because I actually need the index)
[12:14:25] <LindsayMac> stuffmc:  https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/jquery-en/II0ha5vj5Mk
[12:14:29] <LindsayMac> that might help push you along?
[12:16:19] <NoiseEee> sigh
[12:16:24] <NoiseEee> beat by a moment!  http://jsfiddle.net/CGzMq/ @ stuffmc
[12:17:43] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  but you actually DID it.. i just googled it
[12:17:59] <LSshock> Hi everyone, i'm trying to use nextUntil() in a more simple test it can find the IDs but in the real test it fails

[12:18:53] <wicchan> heyyyy
[12:20:07] <wicchan> whats the best way to trigger a partial that is loaded via ajax
[12:21:51] <manster> is there anyway to execet jquery code for an anchor, AFTER page load. right now as i have it its executing instantly and then the browser follows the anchor link and gets rid of whatever jquery code i tried to use
[12:23:11] <wicchan> i think you can attach an onload event to the body
[12:23:26] <Sample> lathan: i'm issuing the breakpoint by telling the chrome console to break on "Event Listener" click
[12:23:31] <Atty> is jquery weekcalendar and fullcalendar very similiar as far as the hooks are concerned?
[12:29:52] <Atty> is jquery weekcalendar and fullcalendar very similiar as far as the hooks are concerned? I mean as far as updating deleteing events..
[12:31:04] <RyChiss> Does anyone know how I can give a variable a value only if an item is toggled? For example, if someone clicks on "entrepreneur" I want the variable word1 to = 1, or if they un-highlight entrepreneur, word1 = 0 - http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/17/
[12:32:11] <andy55> RyChiss, I just implemented the exact same thing yesterday lol
[12:32:43] <RyChiss> andy55: do you have an example somewhere?
[12:33:10] <RyChiss> awesome
[12:35:40] <codepython777> sitewide error dialogs -- any recommendations?
[12:35:59] <codepython777> And I hope I dont have to fiddle with the CSS of the dialog
[12:36:03] <dabear> RyChiss: do NOT use variables for each word
[12:36:12] <dabear> RyChiss: DO use an object for this
[12:36:42] <dabear> e.g. var words = {};
[12:37:20] <dabear> in the click handler, do this after the highlight: words[$.text(this)] = 1
[12:38:06] <codepython777> in jquery ui dialog, do i have to do a custom error dialog by fiddling with CSS?
[12:38:30] <RyChiss> dabear: okay, trying it out
[12:40:50] <dabear> and at least try to implement setting it to 0 when unselected by your self
[12:40:54] <gdoteof> i have an array of letters.  foreach one i want to find every id like '#letter-<LETTER>' and add to that element, class="none"
[12:42:20] <dabear> gdoteof: do an each loop, replace the last part of the string with each element in the array, select it, then use addClass/removeClass
[12:42:36] <dabear> all those things can be found in the api docs
[12:54:22] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. When creating a controller object that I am storing in an element's data object, if I want to bind custom event handlers to the element that call methods of my controller object, does it matter that the methods I want to call are created later in the code by extending the controller's prototype?
[12:54:50] <Whirl3d> sorry, that was a mouthful.
[12:56:55] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: that depends on how you're adding the event handlers
[12:57:33] <johnkpaul> var self = this;$().on('customevt', function(){self.funcAddedAterward();} is fine
[12:58:00] <skyjumper> anyone know of a plugin that scrolls the window so that a particular element is fully viewable?
[12:58:02] <johnkpaul> whereas var self = this;$().on('customevt', this.funcAddedAterward) is not
[12:59:32] <RyChiss> dabear - not sure if i was fully understanding what you were saying. I implemented the code and it breaks what I had previously: http://jsfiddle.net/3R2Pg/19/
[13:00:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/kKzr5/1/
[13:01:46] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks for the reply. Just noticed a mistake in my fiddle.
[13:02:23] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: how are you going to use newSection?
[13:02:30] <johnkpaul> anyway, send me a new link when you're ready
[13:04:29] <chclto> $5 paypal to anyone who can suggest a pair of shoes similar to these (low profile/small sole) that i like enough to buy http://i.imgur.com/MrNpt.jpg
[13:04:41] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks for helping: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/kKzr5/2/
[13:05:14] <johnkpaul> no problem
[13:05:33] <johnkpaul> ok, so Whirl3d, I have one issue with this
[13:05:34] <Whirl3d> basically, I was trying to encapsulate the "page" change concept in order to facilitate different methods. For example, the "gallery" section doesn't have "pages" per se...so it's implementation will be slightly different
[13:05:41] <Whirl3d> hit me
[13:05:42] <johnkpaul> you're extending the prototype, but you're not every using the new operator
[13:05:50] <johnkpaul> I dont' think you understand exactly what the prototype is for
[13:06:02] <Whirl3d> I meant var sect=new newSection()   lol
[13:06:04] <johnkpaul> extending newSEction.prototype does not affect properties on newSection
[13:06:09] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[13:06:40] <Whirl3d> sorry about that. I guess I shouldn't call the init function newSection...makes new newSection confusing
[13:07:36] <johnkpaul> :) eh, that happens, you can make that change
[13:07:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/kKzr5/3/
[13:08:51] <johnkpaul> so Whirl3d, what is the problem that you're having?
[13:09:03] <Whirl3d> Do I need a prototype prototype? In other words, my gallery's implementation of "showPage" need to be different from the normal "showPage"
[13:09:32] <johnkpaul> that's ok, then you just need to etend SEction.prototype by whatever you want
[13:09:57] <Sample> Q: Does anyone have the issue in which, when setting Event Listener breakpoints in the Chrome debugging environment (which is very good), a breakpoint on something like "click" will not show where the click originated (or allow you to "step out") but rather shows you the actual click handing code of the jquery library
[13:10:25] <Sample> if anyone is familiar with advanced debugging using the chrome tools
[13:10:56] <Whirl3d> so the standard interface for all sections is "showPage"   and then each section instance presumably can override the prototype's showPage with it's own version, correct?
[13:11:09] <Whirl3d> or is there a better way to do this?
[13:12:01] <Whirl3d> Sample, I wish I could help. I look forward to knowing the answer though.
[13:13:35] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I think this is a fine way to do it, I need to see it actually being used to give a better critique
[13:14:26] <Whirl3d> cool enough. Thanks. I'll work on it and post back.
[13:17:55] <scotdb> jquery datatables editable : I only want the add, not the delete and update functionality.   How do I totally disable this.   In particular, the update seems pervasive ... for example, when I return an empty string as an element in JSON I get a "Click to Edit" displayed in the cell ...

[13:58:37] <manster> Atty: something like that, I mean a way to set the letter-spacing attribute based on an elements container
[13:59:40] <manster> I want [mytext       ] to automatically fit  [m y t e x t] based on the available area[]
[14:00:06] <manster> asumming this -> [ ]  is a div
[14:00:45] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I'm outputting an array via console.log() at the beginning of two separate events that can be triggered while everything is in the same state (two buttons I can click on that are beside eachother). One of them outputs undefined, while the other outputs the array. Does JS's async execution effect stuff like this?
[14:00:52] <DeltaHeavy|Work> http://pastebin.com/b3PF5Sxi   <-- Those two console.logs are outputting undefined in the case of the first event, and the array in the second event. They are triggered by pressing one of two buttons beside each other (save/cancel)
[14:01:31] <manster> so if it were [                                   ]- this big i'd get  [m      y       t      e      x      t ]
[14:01:57] <manster> i want my text to automatically expand to fit its div without too much code if possible
[14:02:11] <LSshock> Hi everyone, i'm trying to use nextUntil() in a more simple test it can find the IDs but in the real test it fails http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/5/ Â the IDs are there but nothing happens
[14:02:17] <manster> if no one knows an easy way, i can just do the coding, but i was hoping to avoid reinventing the wheel
[14:02:30] <LindsayMac> manster:  you will need to do some math and use letter spacing
[14:02:50] <manster> LindsayMac: so i feared.... thank you for confirming
[14:03:18] <LindsayMac> you have to calculate the number of letters in a container, then the width of each letter, the width of the container, and then adjust the letterspcing, but i am pretty sure even that will not be entirely accurate
[14:03:25] <LindsayMac> I can't imagine any situation where that would look good
[14:03:50] <Whirl3d> LSshock, I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to do.
[14:04:13] <LSshock> trying to filter out a specifc part of the content
[14:04:30] <LSshock> its not wrapped in a tag so i have to do it somehow but the content isnt always the same inbetween the sections (<h2>)
[14:04:57] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I have a link to a live example if anybody wants it
[14:05:01] <LSshock> but its basically <h2>header</h2> <p> etcâ€¦. till a new <h2></h2>
[14:05:46] <Whirl3d> but right now, your element that you are using nextUntil on is heirarchically not in line with your other content
[14:07:03] <Ghost1227> i'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < " on the following script... http://ideone.com/SjPUv can anyone give me an idea why?
[14:07:22] <Ghost1227> *can anyone give me an idea why
[14:07:29] <mikepj> manster: try text-align:justify; text-justify:newspaper;
[14:07:40] <LSshock> Whirl3d is there  another way?
[14:07:44] <mikepj> unless i'm misunderstanding what you want
[14:08:24] <Whirl3d> THere is, specifically, nextUntil finds only next siblings
[14:08:33] <Whirl3d> so that would only find elements within the h2
[14:08:58] <LSshock> but i tried a dummy test like this http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/ which seemed to work
[14:09:08] <LSshock> or i thought i knew what it did :/
[14:09:16] <Whirl3d> but the id is on the h2
[14:09:34] <Whirl3d> which is correct. On the previous fiddle it was inside the h2 on the span
[14:09:47] <LSshock> oh right! ~__~
[14:09:58] <LSshock> so its basically doing nextuntil of the same kind
[14:10:03] <myrman> Can someone recommend me a good lightbox? I've tried slimbox, shadowbox and a few others. Not sure which are good
[14:10:19] <Brodingo> myrman try colorbox
[14:10:21] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/evtns/8/
[14:11:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/evtns/9/
[14:11:56] <Whirl3d> sorry, forgot to move the id's for both h2 elements
[14:12:16] <LSshock> Whirl3d: im so sorry but i can chagne the content this is from a external page
[14:12:19] <myrman> Will do, Brodingo
[14:12:38] <LSshock> should have told you that, but i sortof assumed it would be clear since i wouldnt ask to do something with jquery if i could just alter the html/content
[14:13:15] <Whirl3d> Try selecting the parent of the id and using nextUntil() with filter...
[14:14:40] <JFranks> Awww.. I saw a ton of duplication going on with my checkbox buttons.. so I tried to use an array to define the functions.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/51/   .. As you can see the non-array button (Show Mine Only) still writes to the console but the other two are brain dead.. Looks like I could just solve this with PHP?
[14:15:36] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/evtns/10/
[14:15:41] <Whirl3d> not sure why that doesn't work, though
[14:16:11] <LSshock> yeah looks pretty good
[14:16:17] <Ghost1227> nothing?
[14:16:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/evtns/11/
[14:16:50] <Whirl3d> forgot to change the id back. LOL
[14:17:08] <LSshock> you did it
[14:17:11] <LSshock> you mad genius
[14:17:23] <LSshock> after trying to figure it out for like 3 hours you did it in 3 minutes
[14:17:30] <LSshock> i cant thank you enough
[14:17:33] <Atty> manster I get what your puttin down but I dont think what I had in mind orginally would not work..
[14:19:22] <Whirl3d> JFranks, you are trying to get Jquery to act like PHP, I think. gimme a second to fix your fiddle.
[14:19:41] <LSshock> Whirl3d: thanks a lot, have a great day :)
[14:20:38] <JFranks> Whirl3d: Yeah using a PHP foreach loop to write that block of script works.. but it's not the 'right' way and didn't learn me nuthin' (smirk)
[14:20:59] <JFranks> It feels .. dirty..
[14:21:12] <bigLanky> http://beyond.team4.ciplex.com/pricing <-- if you go to this page and add aproduct from the bottom of the page, you will be taken to the cart page
[14:21:23] <bigLanky> i am trying to hide the entire column where it displays the quantity
[14:21:39] <bigLanky> my jquery-hide-qty.js looks like:   $('.page-cart table.sticky-enabled th:nth-child(4)').css('display', 'none');
[14:21:44] <bigLanky> but it's not hiding it
[14:21:51] <bigLanky> any ideas?
[14:22:27] <JFranks> If you use object inspector is it passing the 'none' to the display value?
[14:22:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/wJcwF/53/
[14:24:01] <Whirl3d> JFranks, by listening for the change event (which bubbles up) on the container of the checkboxes, you can assign the "checked" class (though probably not needed) and then refresh the table.
[14:24:43] <Whirl3d> technically, you could skip most of that and just do $("#fixed").on("change", "input[type='checkbox']",refreshtable);
[14:24:47] <JFranks> Whirl3d: Great work sir.. I needed the class change for a different function.. I have a sloppy table that reloads entirely.. :(
[14:25:21] <JFranks> (and couldn't get anyone to explain how to check the button state) :(
[14:25:54] <Whirl3d> I usually use $(elem).is(":checked")  but I think there's a preferred way
[14:25:54] <JFranks> So I just do something like: if ($('#showstart').hasClass("checked")){ var updateparams = updateparams + '&hidestart=true';}
[14:26:03] <JFranks> Ahhh..
[14:26:20] <Whirl3d> I think $("elem").prop("checked") is the preferred way, but never tried it
[14:26:59] <JFranks> Oh hey there's another easy question.. why can't I do "var updateparams .= foo" vs... "var updateparams = updateparams + foo" ?
[14:27:24] <Whirl3d> . is not a jquery or javascript operator, I don't think
[14:27:34] <Whirl3d> you can use +=
[14:27:39] <JFranks> What's the right syntax .. AH!
[14:27:46] <JFranks> Learning so much.. Thanks man
[14:27:51] <Whirl3d> but not for properties
[14:27:51] <pifantastic> bigLanky: first, use .hide()
[14:27:56] <pifantastic> bigLanky: as opposed to .css
[14:28:11] <Whirl3d> in other words, {type:obj, val:someting}+= will fail
[14:28:37] <bigLanky> pifantastic: so it would be:    $('.page-cart table.sticky-enabled th:nth-child(4)').css ?
[14:28:46] <JFranks> Whirl3d: Yikes.. I'm not that far .. yet.. but thanks! ;)
[14:28:56] <pifantastic> bigLanky: no, $('.page-cart table.sticky-enabled th:nth-child(4)').hide();
[14:29:20] <pifantastic> bigLanky: second, you have errors in your javascript: http://grimhappy.com/i/6a7e85.png
[14:29:33] <pifantastic> bigLanky: so the code you wrote isn't even excuting
[14:30:26] <pifantastic> bigLanky: and lastly, the code you want, is probably: jQuery('.page-cart table.sticky-enabled th:nth-child(4), .page-cart table.sticky-enabled td:nth-child(4)').hide();
[14:31:47] <bigLanky> i updated my code to jQuery('.page-cart table.sticky-enabled th:nth-child(4), .page-cart table.sticky-enabled td:nth-child(4)').hide();
[14:32:13] <bigLanky> applied changes and nothing happening
[14:32:17] <bigLanky> is it still not getting executed?
[14:33:23] <pifantastic> bigLanky: you need to make sure your code waits for the document ready event
[14:33:30] <pifantastic> bigLanky: so all together, you want this: http://jsbin.com/iwilig/1/edit
[14:34:36] <bigLanky> ok updated
[14:34:45] <pifantastic> bigLanky: is that working like you expected?
[14:34:48] <bigLanky> i feel like im still missing a piece

[14:35:33] <LindsayMac> yen_:  ?
[14:35:46] <yen_> need some help with the slideshow jquery. How can I customize this slider http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/ to make each slide into a new page view..
[14:35:56] <JFranks> Whirl3d: Oh you mean it doesn't work.. :)  http://jsfiddle.net/92TLN/  .. Need some basic javascript learning.. ;p
[14:35:56] <yen_> lindsaymac hey!
[14:36:01] <LindsayMac> yen_:  hi.
[14:36:19] <LindsayMac> yen_:  you can put any html into a slide.. so basically put your page html in there
[14:37:21] <yen_> look here is an example of what i am trying to achieve: http://www.ivillage.com/no-cook-appetizers/3-b-408105#408104
[14:37:35] <yen_> click on each slide arror and see how the URL changes.
[14:38:09] <LindsayMac> Ahh you want the hash to update
[14:38:23] <JFranks> Hmmmmm.. I can't seem to find the right syntax at all .. looks like you have to say 'the var = the var + the extra value"
[14:38:35] <yen_> LindsayMac uh huh :-)
[14:38:52] <yen_> we need to track the visits to each image seperately.
[14:39:17] <LindsayMac> yen_:  what makes you wan tot use that one over others?
[14:39:24] <JFranks> can't you load the # as an <a href='#foobar'></a>   .. dynamically?
[14:39:42] <ooxoo> hi
[14:39:55] <Whirl3d> JFranks, what do you mean "load"
[14:39:56] <yen_> over what others?
[14:40:21] <JFranks> well add that to the element so when you click it the anchor is pushed into the URL
[14:40:26] <LindsayMac> yen_:  there are a million sliders out there.. some that are specific made for this
[14:40:52] <yen_> LindsayMac -- that is just an example. I would love to use a plugin for wp that can achieve this.
[14:40:52] <LindsayMac> yen_:  use this one.. its more suited to your needs http://flesler.blogspot.com/2009/03/jquerylocalscroll-127-released.html
[14:40:57] <yen_> LindsayMac> any thoughts
[14:41:06] <LindsayMac> yen_:  if you want a WP plugin, google "content sliders"
[14:41:30] <Whirl3d> JFrank, an anchor will act like a normal html anchor (because it is) if jquery doesn't do anything with it. So it will add it to the location if clicked.
[14:41:33] <bigLanky> pifantastic: thanks for all of your help I got it working
[14:41:43] <yen_> yes wp for sure, but most content sliders i have seen don't show each image in a new page view..
[14:41:46] <yen_> LindsayMac
[14:42:13] <LindsayMac> yen_:  they are not new page views.. it's just a div container with an id
[14:42:25] <LindsayMac> the script then adds the id #mydivid to the url
[14:42:45] <JFranks> That's what he wants.. if there's no matching anchor it's just going to fire the hash # into the URL without effecting the page. ;)
[14:43:00] <Whirl3d> JFranks, in your fiddle, you said   var containher+=something....that's like saying call this variable 50
[14:43:06] <Whirl3d> it doesn't make sense
[14:43:14] <LindsayMac> JFranks: i know.. and most content sliders do that
[14:43:26] <Whirl3d> you would want to use var to define a new variable
[14:43:33] <joikus> I'm trying to change an img src in my $.post callback using: $('.logo img').attr('src',result.properLogoUrl+ '&t=' + Math.random() * 10000000000000000);
[14:43:36] <joikus> but it's not rendering
[14:43:44] <Whirl3d> var newcontainher=containher+A
[14:43:45] <joikus> when I inspect the url works fine
[14:43:53] <yen_> so it's nt a new page view but it counts as one? LindsayMac
[14:43:58] <Whirl3d> or just continher+=A;
[14:44:06] <joikus> when I inspect, and edit the url it renders
[14:44:09] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i have no idea what you mean by new page view or counting as one..
[14:44:23] <joikus> result.properLogoUrl is an external url
[14:44:34] <Whirl3d> then console.log(containher) will = "Canadians say eh"
[14:44:47] <yen_> I mean, everytime that URL changes it counts as a new page view via analytics.
[14:44:59] <LindsayMac> Ohhhh you are now talking about analytics.. I have no ide a
[14:45:06] <JFranks> Whirl3d: That's what I mean, I didn't understand your example.. that's what I took from it as a way to do the same thing as PHP "$x = 'foo'; $y = 'bar'; $z = 'The '.$x; $z .= ' is really '.$y;"
[14:45:53] <yen_> well that changing URL needs to be tracked as a new page view. for example someone flips thru 5 slides, it's 5 page views.
[14:45:54] <yen_> LindsayMac
[14:45:56] <Whirl3d> JFranks, but what you said in js terms was more like:   $x='foo'; $y='bar'; $______+=
[14:46:00] <Whirl3d> What's the _____
[14:46:10] <yen_> hope that makes it a bit more clear LindsayMac>
[14:46:10] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i have no idea.. thats a ga question
[14:46:43] <yen_> but the div container with an id, what does that achieve?
[14:46:49] <Whirl3d> Use var __only__ to define the var the first time
[14:47:00] <yen_> LindsayMac why would someone do that? for what reasons?
[14:47:07] <LindsayMac> yen_:  the purpose of it is so that you can link directly to the slide / copy paste the link and it will go to that slide
[14:47:18] <Ghost1227> better question... why is this always returning false??? http://ideone.com/ibCP1
[14:47:24] <Whirl3d> it's a function that says, "create a variable named ____"
[14:47:24] <Ghost1227> despite being true
[14:47:50] <Whirl3d> so the sentence "create a variable named containerher+=" doesn't make any sense
[14:48:33] <yen_> isnt that whata all slideshows do? LindsayMac
[14:48:48] <LindsayMac> yen_:  not all sliders update the hash.. as you showed me
[14:48:49] <yen_> but they dont need to update the URL
[14:48:56] <Whirl3d> once you have defined the variable (which you did with var containher="Canadians say "; ) then you just use the variable reference to add to it just like in PHP
[14:49:04] <yen_> yeah why the hash update?
[14:49:08] <yen_> LindsayMac
[14:49:18] <yen_> whats the use of that,?LindsayMac
[14:49:19] <LindsayMac> yen_:  if I am browsing a site, and I stop on a slide, and I copy and paste a url to share it with someone, when they click the link, they will go to the site with the first slide open, instead of the nth
[14:50:07] <Whirl3d> $containerher.=$a     is the same as containher+=A
[14:50:13] <yen_> so thats why each slide has a different url so if u share, it shares that soecific image LindsayMac
[14:50:21] <yen_> ?
[14:50:38] <LindsayMac> yes yen_
[14:50:59] <xrdodrx> I can't get the jquery dialog() function to work for some reason. I'm loading jquery.js, jquery-ui.css and jquery-ui.js. Am I missing something? :\
[14:51:02] <yen_> hmm..thats interesting.
[14:51:04] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i suppose it could be used for GA but i have no idea if GA consideres it a unique page
[14:51:16] <LindsayMac> yen_:  is that the only reason you want to update the url?
[14:51:20] <yen_> yes
[14:51:35] <xec_> xrdodrx: what does your code look like? get any errors?
[14:51:42] <LindsayMac> yen_:  then you have to first find out if it even does that. And I do not know the answer to that
[14:51:55] <LindsayMac> yen_:  and a simple google gives some answers http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4811172/is-it-possible-to-track-hash-links-like-pages-with-google-analytics
[14:52:29] <xrdodrx> TypeError: $("#dialog").dialog is not a function
[14:52:53] <yen_> so it can ! :)
[14:53:13] <yen_> LindsayMac, you made this girl happy!
[14:53:30] <LindsayMac> ok. yen_
[14:53:42] <santippe> \o/
[14:53:46] <LindsayMac> yen_:  in the future, just google for your answer. MOST answers exist there.
[14:53:47] <santippe> evening all...
[14:53:51] <xec_> xrdodrx: what happens if you try jQuery("#dialog").dialog() instead?
[14:54:02] <yen_> LindsayMac -- hey i knew abt the google part, u just confirmed it.
[14:54:10] <LindsayMac> what?!
[14:54:11] <LindsayMac> omg.
[14:54:14] <LindsayMac> whatever
[14:54:29] <yen_> yeah i wanted to know how to make the google link to the url
[14:54:35] <yen_> but i know that it can be tracked.
[14:54:44] <tw2113> apparently my work last night was all for naught
[14:54:45] <Whirl3d> JFranks, I updated your fiddle with some notes for you: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/92TLN/4/
[14:54:47] <xrdodrx> xec_: TypeError: jQuery("#dialog").dialog() is not a function
[14:54:51] <yen_> tw2113
[14:54:52] <xrdodrx> so the same thing
[14:54:53] <yen_> hey!
[14:55:05] <yen_> u left tw2114
[14:55:06] <Whirl3d> tw2113, but you looked good regardless
[14:55:08] <JFranks> Whirl3d:	"or just containher+=A; then console.log(containher) will = "Canadians say eh"" http://jsfiddle.net/92TLN/2/ ??
[14:55:08] <yen_> tw2113
[14:55:22] <xec_> xrdodrx: right. is your site live somewhere?
[14:55:27] <yen_> i know it was super late
[14:55:33] <tw2113> that's my nick, wear it out
[14:55:46] <Whirl3d> JFranks, did you see the notes I wrote in your fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/92TLN/4/
[14:55:55] <JFranks> Ahh sorry I was in scrollback
[14:56:02] <JFranks> Thanks.. So the 'var' was doing me?
[14:56:07] <xrdodrx> no, i'm testing it on my local web server site xec_. i've used jquery before but not often
[14:56:10] <Whirl3d> yep
[14:56:20] <xrdodrx> it's a very minimal example so let me put it on jsfiddle
[14:56:25] <yen_> tw2113 so what do u thnk of what LindsayMac says abt the  a div container with an id
[14:56:38] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i didnt say anything... I just googled for you
[14:56:46] <santippe> xD
[14:56:46] <tw2113> i had your solution, all you had left was actually adding google analytics and getting a slider in place
[14:56:50] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i personally have NO IDEA if GA can track hashes
[14:57:04] <tw2113> i solved step 3 when you still technically had step 1 and 2 to do
[14:57:06] <yen_> LindsayMac, it does
[14:57:39] <LindsayMac> yen_:  but that wasn't something I knew.. I just googled for you
[14:57:50] <yen_> thank u
[14:57:53] <tw2113> whoa....googling shit
[14:58:03] <LindsayMac> god forbid tw2113
[14:58:10] <yen_> tw2113 i did all 3 steps but am so stuck of advanced
[14:58:16] <tcial> Can someone review my code, and make sure there's no bugs in it?
[14:58:17] <LindsayMac> All I want to do is go for a 2 hour run today...
[14:58:30] <LindsayMac> yen_:  you didnt because step 1) install slider
[14:58:31] <santippe> too hot for a setTimeout called function in an external file question...
[14:58:42] <tcial> http://jackwilsdon.tk/ is the site, the menu has the jQuery. http://jackwilsdon.tk/js/default.js is the JS for the menu
[14:58:42] <LindsayMac> Step 2) install GA
[14:58:42] <xrdodrx> http://jsfiddle.net/mcdsn/ xec_
[14:59:17] <yen_> lindsaymac  installed a slider yesterday
[14:59:26] <yen_> what are u talking abt? im confuised?
[14:59:38] <LindsayMac> yen_:  you get ahead of yourself.. next time slow down.
[14:59:40] <tw2113> step 1, get google analytics put into the site
[14:59:45] <tw2113> really easy
[14:59:48] <xec_> xrdodrx: are you sure that's the correct link? looks like a failed attempt at looping an array
[14:59:50] <tw2113> follow their instructions
[14:59:51] <yen_> step 1 is done.
[15:00:00] <yen_> step 2 is installing the slide, done.
[15:00:01] <tw2113> step 2: get a slider installed and configured and sliding
[15:00:02] <xrdodrx> oops
[15:00:09] <yen_> step 3 was customization -- that's where i am now.
[15:00:14] <Whirl3d> tcial, rather than use $("this").find("a").attr('class');   use $("this").find('a").hasClass('active') or .is(".active");
[15:00:24] <tw2113> make sure you know how to configure beyond the defaults if you need
[15:00:32] <tcial> Whirl3d: hasClass wouldn't work for me o_o
[15:00:41] <tcial> Whirl3d: It always returned false
[15:01:10] <tw2113> step 3: question whoever is saying you need to track slides
[15:01:11] <xrdodrx> http://jsfiddle.net/mcdsn/1/ xec_ ?
[15:01:15] <tcial> Ah
[15:01:17] <yen_> tw2113 my question is this...u said go to the advance tab and customize the 3rd to the last grey box...http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[15:01:20] <yen_> remember?
[15:01:21] <tcial> I was doing it wrong before
[15:01:21] <tw2113> step 4: ask them again just to be sure
[15:01:24] <tcial> Whirl3d: Thanks :D
[15:01:34] <yen_> ha ha love your stepp 3
[15:01:41] <pyF-AM> hello all, quick question
[15:01:56] <yen_> you are such a rebel tw2113
[15:01:57] <tw2113> step 5: follow the example in that box i mentioned, because it shows an instance of using the after: callback
[15:02:08] <tw2113> i'm highly sarcastic, you get used to it
[15:02:15] <pyF-AM> i have <div id="nav"><img ...><img ...><img ...></div>
[15:02:16] <tcial> Whirl3d: Any more reccomendations? there's also http://jackwilsdon.tk/js/ns-basic.js
[15:02:27] <LindsayMac> yen_:  do you drink a lot of coffee?
[15:02:27] <tw2113> step 6: drop in the callback function i showed last night
[15:02:28] <yen_> hehe i am.
[15:02:32] <yen_> why?
[15:02:34] <xec_> xrdodrx: looks like the link to jquery ui is failing
[15:02:41] <LindsayMac> yen_:  no reason.. just curious.
[15:02:50] <tw2113> i question those who don't drink coffee
[15:02:50] <HEMI> So I'm running in to a Request-URI too long error from my server...Obviously, I should have thought about this beforehand. I'm passing a bunch of IDs using the id[] array format to a new page. I tried switching to POST using the jQuery .post method, but I can't seem to get any page I'm .posting to to actually DO anything. I've got a test page that simply alerts with the contents of _POST, but I'm not getting the alert. :(
[15:02:54] <HEMI> Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[15:02:56] <pyF-AM> can I attach events via .on() to each img and have the callback change that image source?
[15:03:04] <yen_> yes i do :-)
[15:03:11] <xrdodrx> [18:02:08.812] GET https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery-ui/1.8.21/jquery-ui.js [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 42ms]
[15:03:17] <xrdodrx> How can that be though? :o
[15:03:21] <LindsayMac> it shows
[15:03:27] <yen_> no way? why!!?
[15:03:28] <LindsayMac> >:)
[15:03:29] <yen_> ha ha
[15:03:41] <LindsayMac> you're a spaz
[15:03:54] <LindsayMac> I can hear the caffeine jitters through the cpu
[15:04:01] <xrdodrx>  wow
[15:04:07] <xrdodrx> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[15:04:09] <xrdodrx> it's linked here
[15:04:13] <xrdodrx> but when you click it it's a 404
[15:04:18] <xrdodrx> you can't trust anyone anymore
[15:04:20] <xrdodrx> ;)
[15:04:22] <yen_> i like coffee, but i drink like 2 cups a day
[15:04:23] <tcial> xrdodrx: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.21/jquery-ui.js
[15:04:28] <yen_> i used to drink a lot more.
[15:04:33] <LindsayMac> yikes
[15:04:35] <tcial> There shouldn't be a dash in jquery-ui
[15:04:56] <tcial> Well, the folder is just called jqueryui
[15:04:58] <yen_> and im not a spaz..just very determined to figure this damn thing out.
[15:05:09] <xrdodrx> tcial: the link on the google site has a dash, check for yourself if you don't believe me
[15:05:11] <xrdodrx> thanks though :)
[15:05:18] <tcial> I believe you!
[15:05:20] <xec_> xrdodrx: hes right, http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.21/jquery-ui.js works
[15:05:22] <tcial> It's just human error
[15:05:46] <LindsayMac> erm
[15:06:53] <xrdodrx> still not working lol, no errors anymore, just no dialog
[15:06:58] <santippe> well...
[15:07:22] <xec_> xrdodrx: use <link> to link stylesheets (not <style>)
[15:07:33] <santippe> can i ask about a setTimeout function...
[15:07:48] <santippe> i've problem calling it from an external ref...
[15:08:11] <santippe> searched on google but i've found a proper working solution
[15:08:19] <santippe> *ivven't
[15:08:26] <xrdodrx> xec_: still no dialog :(
[15:09:05] <xrdodrx> <link type="text/css" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.21/themes/base/jquery-ui.css">
[15:09:23] <xec_> xrdodrx: rel="stylesheet" might help
[15:09:25] <santippe> xrdodrx...
[15:09:39] <santippe> i think that's a https...
[15:09:53] <Whirl3d> tcial, there are a couple of things you should consider: appending <b> to an anchor element on hover is not a good thing. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CuHJA/1/
[15:10:13] <HEMI>     $.post("export-test.php", { 'type': type, 'id[]': rowIDs } );
[15:10:15] <xec_> santippe: thats really really simple for you to check and find out isnt it :)
[15:10:20] <xrdodrx> well, now i know it's being loaded, but still no dialog
[15:10:22] <xrdodrx> :\
[15:10:27] <HEMI> Is that goign to do what I want if rowIDs contains an array of numbers?
[15:10:40] <xrdodrx> since i get a ton of CSS Warnings in the console now ;)
[15:11:05] <pyF-AM> am I understanding .on() correctly?    $("#nav").on("click", "img", function(){ $(this).attr('src', new_source) });
[15:11:19] <dogarrhea2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work lol@ the second part of the story?
[15:11:23] <yen_> tw2113 http://www.refinery29.com/loeffler-randall-lace-up-rain-boots check this.
[15:11:54] <tw2113> what about it
[15:11:59] <xrdodrx> i never imagined it would be this difficult to open a dialog
[15:12:26] <HEMI> I never imagined it would be difficult to get data from one page to another. :(
[15:12:37] <pyF-AM> Can anyone assist me with .on() ?
[15:13:04] <tcial> Whirl3d: Thanks!
[15:13:17] <mikepj> ? on
[15:13:22] <mikepj> aw
[15:13:28] <yen_> tw2113 looks cool, eh?
[15:13:31] <yen_> similar concept/
[15:13:35] <Whirl3d> bot-t is dead!  8(
[15:13:38] <tw2113> eh
[15:13:47] <tw2113> you're stuck on the mindset that you NEED a unique url
[15:13:48] <LindsayMac> personally i hate those slidesrs..
[15:15:05] <xec_> xrdodrx: it's not really that hard http://jsfiddle.net/mcdsn/3/
[15:15:33] <xec_> xrdodrx: you just need to get the basics sorted 1st -- link js and css files properly
[15:16:16] <xrdodrx> i got it :) had a dash in the stylesheet for some reason too
[15:16:18] <xec_> xrdodrx: in jsfiddle this is done via the add resources and/or choose framework options
[15:17:01] <xrdodrx> xec_: that's a different story for a different day, but really it makes no sense to have to use <link> and not <style> for external CSS but you can use <script> for both internal and external javascript
[15:17:03] <xrdodrx> :p
[15:17:23] <xrdodrx> but yes, that was my error, definitely :)
[15:17:27] <xec_> xrdodrx: yeah, html is a mess for a myriad of reasons
[15:18:11] <xec_> no way around it in web dev though :)
[15:19:27] <manster> i'm getting an odd issue when i try to count the number of anchor tags in my main menu and to get their widths. http://jordanstabile.webu.us   if you take a looke at the console log, you'll see that there are several 0 widths, but i have no clue where they are coming from. any ideas?
[15:22:36] <yen_> tw2113 what mindset
[15:22:53] <tw2113> that you NEED a unique url
[15:23:10] <yen_> im not stuck with a mindset, it's what we need. a way to track images.
[15:23:34] <tw2113> and i'm calling bullshit
[15:23:40] <yen_> why?
[15:23:44] <yen_> :-s
[15:23:49] <tw2113> because i don't believe you need it
[15:24:07] <yen_> "i" dont need nothng lol.
[15:24:14] <yen_> i hate slideshws period.
[15:24:40] <yen_> like lindsaymac
[15:24:47] <xec_> manster: you have a hidden #navigation with 5 links that all match the $("li a") selector
[15:24:51] <yen_> they are a waste of time
[15:24:57] <LindsayMac> yen_:  no i like slideshows..
[15:24:58] <xec_> manster: a hidden element with have 0 width
[15:25:04] <xec_> s/with/will
[15:25:06] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i dislike those types that you pointed to
[15:25:14] <yen_> yeah i hate those the most.
[15:25:19] <yen_> but in general hate em all.
[15:25:23] <yen_> useless brainless
[15:26:16] <yen_> i much prefer regular pagination like this: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/815588-green-bay-packers-10-most-underrated-players-on-the-super-bowl-champs/
[15:26:34] <yen_> if u ask my personal opinion...rahter than slideshows.
[15:27:33] <LindsayMac> yen_:  you are lying now. Just before you said it was pretty
[15:27:55] <xec_> manster: http://i.imgur.com/yVHfz.png make sense?
[15:28:44] <yen_> ok w/e
[15:28:55] <yen_> sue me.
[15:29:15] <LindsayMac> no. I dont care. It's just bizarre
[15:29:34] <yen_> no it's not bizare, you are like a 10 yr old kid.
[15:29:57] <yen_> make notes and compare them and read them out to me tomorrow, okay?
[15:30:43] <manster> xec_: looking at it now, and how did you do that btw?
[15:30:47] <yen_> tw2113 -- thanks man, for all the help. Seriously. I appreciate it a lot.
[15:30:58] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/adikev/1/edit
[15:31:01] <manster> how did you circle the stuff, what program or webservice?
[15:31:05] <xec_> manster: the red ovals?
[15:31:10] <tw2113> go there yen
[15:31:14] <xec_> manster: mspaint dude :D
[15:31:29] <xec_> old skool
[15:31:58] <tcial> I get the error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" on a closing }, what  could be causing it?
[15:32:04] <yen_> u are awesome..how did u get this thing to work!
[15:32:08] <yen_> ?
[15:32:15] <tw2113> doing exactly what i told you to do last night
[15:32:17] <LindsayMac> tcial:  thats a PHP error
[15:32:24] <tw2113> with a bit of extra to show the url of the image
[15:32:35] <LindsayMac> Oops i lied
[15:32:43] <LindsayMac> tcial:  dont mind me
[15:32:50] * LindsayMac goes to walk away from the computer. 
[15:32:56] <tcial> LindsayMac: I know a PHP error when I see one ;)
[15:32:59] <tcial> It's finr
[15:33:00] <manster> xec_: haha legit. yea i'm developing indrupal, looks like it display:none rather than just removing the meno from the dom
[15:33:02] <tcial> *fine
[15:33:14] <LindsayMac> tcial:  i know. I'm an idiot right now.. been screwing around with this too much
[15:33:21] <tcial> :P
[15:33:21] * LindsayMac hides under desk 
[15:34:39] <yen_> tw2113 this is stunning.
[15:34:50] <thomedy> i want to see stunning is that a link i can see
[15:35:02] <xec_> tcial: "SyntaxError" usually means your syntax is erroneous </cptobvious>
[15:35:09] <tcial> xD
[15:35:12] <tcial> I fixed it
[15:35:28] <tcial> CLRF line endings and UTF-8 were messed up or something
[15:35:29] <tcial> idfk
[15:35:45] <thomedy> ie can suck it
[15:35:54] <thomedy> im trying to fix an ie specific issue right now
[15:37:12] <tcial> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSQHb/
[15:37:17] <tcial> Why doesn't that work on my site?
[15:37:30] <tcial> #container exists, and I can do opacity
[15:37:41] <shoky> who said you can animate colors
[15:37:47] <yen_> tw2113 in the plugin which files did u edit?
[15:37:48] <xec_> tcial: have you included the color module?
[15:37:56] <tcial> The what module?
[15:37:56] <tw2113> what plugin?
[15:37:57] <tcial> o_o
[15:38:37] <xec_> tcial: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[15:38:52] <tcial> Do I need that to change the backgroundColor attribute?
[15:38:56] <xec_> tcial: jquery core does not animate colors out of the box
[15:39:01] <tcial> Ah
[15:39:04] <LindsayMac> tcial:  you can swap between CSS
[15:39:05] <thomedy> xec ... im getting so much closer
[15:39:07] <thomedy> what up
[15:39:12] <LindsayMac> tcial:  toggleClass instead
[15:39:20] <thomedy> no questions right now... just trying to make ie like me
[15:39:24] <tcial> I now get an error with jQuery.js itself -_-
[15:39:35] <xec_> thomedy: haha good luck with that, dude - IE hates everyone
[15:39:42] <tcial> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: >
[15:39:53] <tcial> in jquery.js
[15:40:01] <LindsayMac> IE is that old man sitting on his porch shaking his fist at children and puppies
[15:40:23] <tcial> Fixed it
[15:41:01] <thomedy> yeah dude i have 4 errors right now
[15:41:17] <thomedy> im trying to make canvas tag play nice in ie
[15:41:26] <thomedy> its kind of a hassle
[15:42:03] <LindsayMac> thomedy:  have you tried HTML5 Shiv
[15:42:20] <thomedy> im going to say no to that
[15:42:22] <thomedy> let me google it
[15:42:23] <xec_> i doubt that'll help you with canvas
[15:42:45] <thomedy> what you may not no is lindsay mac im slightly retarded and trying to fix that every day
[15:42:49] <LindsayMac> xec_:  no?
[15:42:51] <thomedy> know not no
[15:43:43] <xec_> LindsayMac: the html5 shiv is just making html5 elements styleable in old ie, isn't it?
[15:43:46] <LindsayMac> thomedy:  i could be entirely wrong
[15:43:55] <thomedy> the canvas tag is working
[15:44:03] <thomedy> its 2 errors in the excanvas fix
[15:44:05] <thomedy> and 2 in mine
[15:44:10] <tcial> I'm thinking of hiding an easteregg in my site, any ideas?
[15:44:12] <thomedy> mine i hava good idea how to fix
[15:44:22] <thomedy> just with object detection
[15:44:25] <thomedy> and i should be fine
[15:44:30] <thomedy> the 2 in excanvas
[15:44:34] <stuffmc> is a $.each async?
[15:44:38] <thomedy> im at a loss cuz i dont recognize the code
[15:44:47] <dabear> stuffmc: it is not async
[15:44:51] <stuffmc> generally, how to tell what's async?
[15:44:52] <xec_> tcial: yes! make it so that if you press any key or click anywhere on the page, you get rickrolled
[15:44:53] <shoky> stuffmc: no. but if you run async stuff inside then they will be async..
[15:45:02] <tcial> xec_: Too far xS
[15:45:07] <tcial> *xD
[15:45:10] <yen_> tw21143 u around?
[15:45:12] <stuffmc> yeah shoky , logical. Thanks dabear
[15:45:14] <tcial> I was thinking more subtle
[15:45:20] <shoky> stuffmc: if you can provide a callback to run when something is done
[15:45:23] <shoky> then it is async
[15:45:29] <tw2113> sort of
[15:45:33] <shoky> no such callback for .each
[15:45:35] <LindsayMac> ah yea. I was thinking that it since it forces it to register the HTML5 elements and apply appropriate styles..
[15:45:58] <LindsayMac> thomedy:  just read about this http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/
[15:46:28] <stuffmc> I understand the general concept but it's a bit distracting that a callback looks exactly like a function :)
[15:46:50] <Whirl3d> a callback is a function, right?
[15:46:51] <shoky> it would be more distratcing if there was special notation for a callback ;P
[15:46:58] <sonotos> ack
[15:47:05] <shoky> hey whirlz
[15:47:12] <Whirl3d> shoky! Whasssup?
[15:47:20] <shoky> ok kinds
[15:47:21] <shoky> sup
[15:48:41] <tcial> What should happen when someone triggers the easter egg on my site?
[15:48:47] <tcial> What should the easter egg be?
[15:48:58] <LindsayMac> I like the rickroll idea.
[15:48:59] <shoky> +1 for rickrolling
[15:49:02] <shoky> ;]
[15:49:30] <thomedy> thank you lindsay mac im looking at that link right now
[15:49:38] <shoky> tcial if you need to ask such a question then you probably shouldnt have one
[15:49:44] <tcial> :P
[15:49:52] <shoky> i.e. put something creative if you're creative ;P
[15:51:12] <janthony> Does anyone know a good javascript or jQuery text resizing script? I want to be able to specify a min font size and max font size. I tried BigText and FitText, and neither seem to work that well.
[15:51:28] <thomedy> im getting a bad argument thing going on
[15:51:33] <thomedy> stupid excanvas
[15:53:09] <yen_> tw2113 u around
[15:53:28] <yen_> bleacherreport.com/articles/815588-green-bay-packers-10-most-underrated-players-on-the-super-bowl-champs/ -- how is this done? they seem to be using a pagination plugn right?
[15:53:41] <tw2113> sort of
[15:54:21] <tw2113> no idea
[15:54:39] <LindsayMac> its just another type of slider..
[15:54:45] <tw2113> i gave you a url to track, on EVERY slide change already
[15:54:49] <manster> hey anyone wanna take a look at my console out put and see why i dont knwo how to count :/  http://jordanstabile.webu.us/   i'm trying to tound the number of characters in each of my menu items
[15:55:03] <manster> i keep getting "1" for each using the val().length funciton
[15:55:05] <janthony> Any ideas?
[15:55:33] <yen_> lindsaymac knw which one?
[15:55:37] <RohanBhangui> janthony: is the text a fixed thing?
[15:55:38] <shoky> manster: why would it not be 1 ?
[15:55:46] <LindsayMac> yen_:  who knows...
[15:55:48] <RohanBhangui> or does the text change?
[15:55:56] <shoky> manster: you're not doing .val().length ..
[15:56:03] <LindsayMac> yen_:  chances are they made one or customized one .. customized with code, not settings
[15:56:16] <yen_> yes tw2113 i got it!
[15:56:18] <yen_> :-)
[15:56:21] <yen_> u da best
[15:57:00] <RohanBhangui> janthony: if the text remains the same all the time (conside using a vector image (svg) of the text
[15:57:26] <xec_> manster: you're doing .length on a jquery collection - with $(this) it's always going to be just the one item - i.e. 1
[15:57:59] <xec_> manster: do you want the number of characters of the link text or the href url?
[15:58:24] <manster> xec_ the menu link text. eg.   "about" woudl be 5
[15:58:24] <Escherial> hey, anyone have recommendations for a nice jq templating library? i basically just want to fill in some placeholders in an html blurb and attach it somewhere to the DOM without the blurb having to exist in the page before that
[15:58:32] <janthony> RohanBhangui: correct
[15:58:41] <xec_> manster: .text() will return the text
[15:58:52] <xec_> manster: try calling .length on that
[15:59:02] <manster> xec_: i thought that useing "each" would access the items inside the collection
[15:59:21] <shoky> but not their text..
[15:59:23] <manster> xec_ alright here goes
[15:59:25] <Escherial> i don't need any logic in the templates, just a place to put the template and a way to specify that some part of the template gets replaced with some static text specified at the time i attach the templated thing
[15:59:30] <xec_> manster: "this" is an item "$(this)" is a jquery object/collection
[15:59:44] <RohanBhangui> janthony: alternatively you can remove and add a class with different sizes when the window or div resises beyond a certain amount
[16:00:06] <manster> xec_: i tried using "this" first and it didnt work, so i went rougue and started typing anything :)
[16:00:51] <manster> It works!
[16:01:12] <xec_> manster: you could also do this.innerHTML.length for the native js version
[16:02:08] <xec_> quicker and shorter and easier to read
[16:02:44] <manster> xec_: good to know. xec_ did you take courses on js or self taught? because i'm was a cs minor, but i'm trying to figure out what the best books are etc. for jquery
[16:03:41] <xec_> manster: i'm just self taught though i have read books. i'm a fan of sitepoint personally and found "simply javascript" a good read
[16:04:23] <MistuhKurtz> manster, I read the book "DOM Scripting" which was a good intro to Javascript
[16:05:07] <MistuhKurtz> I bought a jQuery book but never ended up reading it b/c jQuery is so intuitive
[16:05:13] <MistuhKurtz> and it quickly became out of date as jQuery was updated
[16:06:33] <dogarrhea2> moral of the story: don't buy printed texts
[16:06:42] <yen_> lindsaymac no ones seems to know in wp
[16:08:01] <MistuhKurtz> dogarrhea2, the DOM Scripting book was still good
[16:08:14] <MistuhKurtz> and I still think it's a good read if somebody wants an introductory book on JS
[16:08:48] <MistuhKurtz> but a printed text for a library or something else in quickly-paced active development, not such a good idea
[16:08:52] <dogarrhea2> you're not getting the drift of what i'm saying. dont' BUY printed texts heh
[16:09:16] <xec_> dogarrhea2: the moral is steal them??
[16:09:41] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:10:19] <dlam> is there a way to make jquery $.post 's all pass a certain header?
[16:10:25] <dlam> (that i specify)
[16:11:04] <dogarrhea2> anyways. is it normal to have blood come out of your mouth when eating nuts?
[16:11:18] <dlam> dogarrhea2: yes, if said nuts are sharp
[16:11:19] <myrman> No, that's bloody nuts
[16:11:20] <xec_> dogarrhea2: are they bloodnuts?
[16:12:04] <xec_> lol this channel is just full of useful help today :D
[16:12:44] <shoky> dlam: use $.ajax
[16:13:01] <xec_> dlam: any reason it needs to be $.post() ? i was thinking you could just make your own method that calls .ajax as you want it to
[16:13:39] <dlam> im using a library, which has a $.post(, and I'd like to not modify it  :D
[16:14:05] <shoky> not modify it, but magically add headers to the request?
[16:14:16] <dlam> yes magically
[16:14:21] <dlam> to any $.post()'s
[16:14:25] <xec_> dlam: well... you *could* override the normal .post with your own though i wouldn't recommend that
[16:14:26] <shoky> ah
[16:14:39] <dlam> aww
[16:14:46] <shoky> you can use $.ajaxSetup i think
[16:14:53] <dlam> ooooo
[16:15:07] <yen_> anyone know which wp plugin this is: bleacherreport.com/articles/815588-green-bay-packers-10-most-underrated-players-on-the-super-bowl-champs/
[16:15:10] <xec_> oh yeah thats true
[16:15:20] <dlam> nice that looks like it might work
[16:15:46] * xec_ gives shoky a big bearhug
[16:15:55] <shoky> ;D
[16:16:00] <shoky> thnx, needed that
[16:16:48] <setsunafseisei> does anyone here have experience with localStorage?
[16:16:55] <xec_> and in case you were wondering - i *am* happy to see you, but hard thing was just my paw.
[16:17:04] <xec_> that*
[16:17:40] <shoky> your erect paw
[16:18:43] <CyberMaN> Hey fellas, sorry to bother you with a newbish question but if you'd oblige, I'd appreciate it... I have this: <div id="container" style="width:50px;white-space:nowrap;overflow:hidden;">a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</div>
[16:19:03] <CyberMaN> but $("#container").scrollLeft() returns null for some reason
[16:19:06] <CyberMaN> any ideas?
[16:20:14] <xec_> CyberMaN: you mean 0?
[16:20:26] <CyberMaN> if I put it on an alert() it says null, not 0
[16:21:39] <xec_> CyberMaN: copypasted your code into jsfiddle and i get 0 back http://jsfiddle.net/Yr4c6/
[16:22:47] <CyberMaN> weird
[16:22:48] <xec_> CyberMaN: so there's something else interfering
[16:25:01] <CyberMaN> xec_, is "var $obj = $("#container");" the proper way to do that?
[16:25:07] <CyberMaN> As in, create a variable with that object
[16:25:46] <xec_> CyberMaN; sure, nothing wrong with that. go ahead and test in the jsfiddle
[16:26:36] <CyberMaN> :/
[16:26:49] <manster> so i'm terrible at math and i wat to know how to apply a certain letter spacing only to particular characters in a string
[16:26:55] <manster> for example <p>mytext<p>   I only want to apply a spacing to "ytex"  and exclude the m and t
[16:26:55] <CyberMaN> $("#container").scrollLeft() works on my end but $obj.scrollLeft() does not
[16:27:01] <CyberMaN> jsfiddle works though
[16:27:01] <dogarrhea2> is it a good thing to have the most medals in the paralympics ?
[16:27:10] <dogarrhea2> or just a sign that your country has the most disabled people
[16:27:45] <manster> http://jordanstabile.webu.us/ the menu here shows my best efforts at getting the letters to have the same amount of spacing through jquery
[16:28:35] <manster> and here is the code i'm currently trying to use to acheive it http://pastie.org/4374394
[16:29:44] <xec_> manster: why don't you just have a space between each letter and make it justified
[16:30:18] <manster> xec_: because the anchor tag ignores any sort of justifying or align property
[16:30:43] <xec_> manster: how sure are you about this, on a scale from 0 to 1?
[16:31:09] <xec_> no decimals allowed! :D
[16:31:18] <manster> xec_ also i want all the words in teh menu to be teh same length. using teh spacebar will not work because each word would need a different amount of spacing
[16:31:27] <manster> but the spacebar is the same amount of space all the time
[16:31:46] <manster> xec_ .99
[16:32:08] <manster> xec_:  crap, see i'm bad at reading too
[16:32:56] <dogarrhea2> what happened to the diveintohtml5 site?
[16:32:59] <dogarrhea2> did they close it?
[16:34:56] <xec_> dogarrhea2: it's still up afaik? http://diveintohtml5.info/
[16:35:04] <dogarrhea2> yea they used to be .org
[16:35:09] <dogarrhea2> i wonder why they are .info now..
[16:35:24] <dogarrhea2> must be some emo "i'm too cool for you" trend or something
[16:39:43] <xec_> manster: yeah i think you're right - the justified idea won't work
[16:41:20] <xec_> manster: and i don't think it's very feasible to calculate letterspacing seeing as different letters have different widths and different browsers render differently etc. you're probably better off with images as buttons if you really want that stretched word look
[16:43:55] <CyberMaN> How can I know if a div has been scrolled all the way to the end?
[16:49:27] <cuonic> Hi
[16:49:51] <chad22> if I want to insert data into a MySQL database using jquery's .ajax() method, is it better to use .submit() and have a form in the html or is it fine to just use a button and use .click()?
[16:50:29] <Escherial> hey, if i detach() an element, is it sufficient to appendTo() it to some other element, or does that create a leak?
[16:50:31] <manster> xec_: yes I have spent the past 4 hours in defiance of using images, but i must now capitulate. i'm guessing  images might even be less taxing than all this js code
[16:50:31] <sbook> chad22: I've always used a form and the event.preventDefault() track
[16:50:45] <sbook> chad22: *trick
[16:50:48] <digs> http://codepad.org/4rovvZX8 -- What am I doing wrong?
[16:51:03] <Escherial> does appendTo() make a copy of the element in question, or does it just put it back in the DOM? i'm assuming a copy, in which case my detach() concerns me since the object's still there
[16:51:07] <cuonic> chad22: I only ever use .submit and event.preventDefault()
[16:51:07] <digs> The doc page: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ : doesn't have a good example using all of them.
[16:51:08] <chad22> sbook, i'll have to look into that trick
[16:52:01] <cuonic> I'm having a problem with a page I'm making, verifying two different forms (one that is loaded later on) doesn't seem to be working for me -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11711247/jquery-validation-not-being-called
[16:52:55] <xec_> manster: on the other hand, i think it looks pretty good already just left aligned. maybe order the menu items by width or something
[16:53:17] <sphinxxx> i'm having an issue where it says "jQuery" is not defined, but "$" is working fine
[16:53:22] <sbook> can anyone give me a hint as to why the ajax method isn't posting data in the body? https://gist.github.com/3231657
[16:53:33] <sphinxxx> here: https://opensky.com/p/alt2-video
[16:53:44] <imsky> sphinxxx, you probably have a second library hijacking $
[16:53:53] <Escherial> ah, another thing; if i attach a click() handler, can i have it arrest processing of subsequent click handlers until, say, an animation has completed?
[16:54:04] <xec_> imsky: that would be the reverse symptoms though
[16:54:05] <Escherial> er, actually, the other click() handlers were attached before
[16:54:09] <sphinxxx> imsky:  I'm using optimizely, which includes jquery on its own
[16:54:49] <imsky> sphinxxx, if you're not getting the jQuery object, you don't have jquery
[16:55:00] <sphinxxx> i am, it works fine in the console
[16:55:11] <imsky> you said jQuery isn't defined
[16:56:01] <sphinxxx> imsky:  can you check the console on the page i linked
[16:56:22] <imsky> where
[16:56:31] <sphinxxx> https://opensky.com/p/alt2-video
[16:56:55] <imsky> $ and jQuery work, so..?
[16:57:13] <sphinxxx> i have a plugin that i'm including, and on that call its saying jQuery not defined
[16:57:22] <sphinxxx> but jQuery is included before those scripts run
[16:57:23] <imsky> ok what's he code
[16:58:28] <xec_> sphinxxx: maybe optimizely is loading jquery after you attemt to run the jquery code
[16:59:02] <sphinxxx> xec_:  wouldn't nothing run until that optimizely scripts loads completely though?
[16:59:16] <xec_> sphinxxx: what is stopping it?
[16:59:26] <imsky> lol
[16:59:49] <sphinxxx> scripts load in order, unless they are async
[17:00:14] <xec_> sphinxxx: and optimizely is loading jquery asynchronously?
[17:00:34] <sphinxxx> i doubt it,  that wouldn't be very smart on their part
[17:00:51] <imsky> i don't think they are
[17:00:57] <imsky> anyway, what's the code sphinxxx
[17:01:13] <sphinxxx> the code is in the page i linked :O
[17:01:27] <imsky> for your plugin
[17:01:37] <LindsayMac> yen_:  you insult me by calling me a 10 y/o and then ask me for help?
[17:01:58] <xec_> well, i dont know what optimizely is doing, but i do know two facts: 1) "jQuery" is not defined when your plugin code is trying to run. 2) jQuery is working fine in console after
[17:02:04] <sphinxxx> if you view source and search "metadata.js"
[17:02:06] <sphinxxx> its there
[17:02:14] <dlam> omg
[17:02:18] <dlam> cookies are just one line strings?
[17:02:26] <sphinxxx> that script is causing the jQuery not defined
[17:02:29] <defaultro> hey guys, my teammate ask me to build a php proxy that will post a data in xml and receive response in xml then format it into json. what the hell is php proxy? He also said it's basically web services
[17:02:33] <snover> LindsayMac: iâ€™m sure it was meant as a complement
[17:02:38] <defaultro> ask/asked
[17:02:44] <LindsayMac> im sure
[17:02:50] <yen_> lindsaymac huh?
[17:02:55] <cuonic> I'm creating a front end for a PHP Authentication system, at the moment building the Password Reset page, the page features 2 "steps". Step 1 : Insert Reset key received by email. The field is verified by the Validation plugin and sent to the php script via ajax post, response is received, error / success message is displayed, then 2 seconds later the div is emptied and a new form is put in it's place. This form doesn't
[17:02:55] <cuonic>  validate and just submits as normal, not via jQuery Ajax. Here is the code : http://pastebin.com/ieTqkmjt
[17:02:56] <yen_> u called me a SPAZ...
[17:03:05] <yen_> hope u dont take evrything seriously
[17:03:24] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i do when you lie to me and then call me a 10 year old and thne come back here begging for help.
[17:03:30] <xec_> sphinxxx: you can find out if this is the issue very easily. try to include jquery the normal way without optimizely and see if you still get the same errors
[17:03:30] <cuonic> I've been scratching my head for over two days, I'm starting to lose hair :D
[17:03:43] <CyberMaN> Hi, can someone tell me how I can tell if a div has been scrolled all the way to the end?
[17:03:47] <yen_> ok what are you talking abt?
[17:03:50] <CyberMaN> I can't seem to find an attribute to denote something like that
[17:03:57] <LindsayMac> anyways.. its not a wordpress question, sO i cant help you. ESPECIALLY since Tw2113 gave you exactly the right code to make it work. yen_
[17:04:11] <yen_> yeah tw2113 is awesome
[17:04:14] <yen_> i had one more question tho..
[17:04:14] <imsky> the optimizely js is 41kb sphinxxx, jquery is loaded async
[17:04:18] <yen_> but he isn't around.
[17:04:22] <xec_> sphinxxx: i expect that you will not
[17:04:30] <sphinxxx> hmm
[17:04:37] <yen_> and im not sure what u are going on abt me lying and all.
[17:05:07] <yen_> i think calling something pretty and then sayng that it is someting i didnt like -- concludes to lying in your book,
[17:05:15] <sphinxxx> ok xec_  i included it normal way for now, and the other issue i'm having is that "mb_YTPlayer" not defined error (see console)
[17:05:18] <LindsayMac> yen_:  you posted the SAME exact question tw2113 answered 20 minutes ago in #wordpress ...
[17:05:38] <yen_> no i was asking abt a plugin.
[17:05:47] <yen_> tw2113 is helpng me with jquery
[17:05:49] <LindsayMac> yen_:  thats exactly what it is. You said you liked something and when we said it wasn't good you said you hated it too
[17:05:52] <yen_> no connection.
[17:05:59] <cuonic> Can anyone help me ?
[17:06:04] <LindsayMac> yen_:  ok.
[17:06:10] <xec_> sphinxxx: where is mb_YTPlayer defined?
[17:06:11] <yen_> i guess i was right, u are prolly 10 yrs old.
[17:06:20] <yen_> why dont u just help people out instead of keepn tabs?
[17:06:28] <xec_> sphinxxx: as in, what file/line
[17:06:30] <yen_> there are many people who need help here..
[17:06:31] <LindsayMac> there it is again
[17:06:32] <sphinxxx> xec_:  in this script: jquery.mb.YTPlayer.js
[17:06:49] <yen_> u've been the same with me, just gossipin and not helping and being rude.
[17:06:55] <LindsayMac> beg for help -> insult -> beg for help -> insult
[17:07:06] <yen_> you called me a spaz, that's impolite and v insulting.
[17:07:13] <LindsayMac> no gossip. Just pointed out that you lied.
[17:07:23] <yen_> geez, u are a child.
[17:07:29] <LindsayMac> either way. Help was given to you by myself AND tw2113.. theres nothing more to do
[17:07:31] <yen_> lets not communicate alright.
[17:07:33] <yen_> go do ur job.
[17:07:41] <yen_> help some people for a change
[17:07:43] <xckpd7> hey guys, question: I'm altering margin bottom for an element near the bottom of the page.... but the browser is actually scrolling down there... how do I disable that?
[17:07:54] <snover> friends.
[17:08:10] <LindsayMac> ew
[17:08:11] <yen_> i guess since tw2113 is not here u are being rude to be again.
[17:08:39] <cuonic> Can anyone help me with this Validation problem ?
[17:08:56] <LindsayMac> cuonic:  sorry i can't. repost your link
[17:09:31] <cuonic> I'm creating a front end for a PHP Authentication system, at the moment building the Password Reset page, the page features 2 "steps". Step 1 : Insert Reset key received by email. The field is verified by the Validation plugin and sent to the php script via ajax post, response is received, error / success message is displayed, then 2 seconds later the div is emptied and a new form is put in it's place. This form doesn't
[17:09:32] <cuonic>  validate and just submits as normal, not via jQuery Ajax. Here is the code : http://pastebin.com/ieTqkmjt
[17:11:43] <yen_> i have one question, does anyone know which slider this is:  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/815588-green-bay-packers-10-most-underrated-players-on-the-super-bowl-champs
[17:11:55] <yen_> (not begging lindsaymac for help)
[17:12:13] <xec_> sphinxxx: was that working before?
[17:12:18] <LindsayMac> yen_:  TW2113 and i BOTH told you NUMEROUS times that it is likely a custom slider or an existing one that has been customized via code
[17:12:38] <sphinxxx> xec_:  nope it was there when i had the query issue too
[17:12:46] <xec_> sphinxxx: is that optimizely thing still including jquery?
[17:12:50] <yen_> ok, show me where u told me this "NUMEROUS" times?
[17:12:56] <yen_> lindsaymac
[17:13:13] <sphinxxx> xec_:  yea
[17:13:27] <LindsayMac> yen_:  go back in your logs. it was a couple hours ago
[17:13:33] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i am done iwth now you
[17:13:36] <yen_> i already did...
[17:13:47] <yen_> but i dont see "numerous" answers from either of u.
[17:13:50] <sphinxxx> xec_:  i took out optimizely there for now, still having the issue
[17:13:54] <yen_> ohh...now look who is a LIAR.
[17:14:06] <shoky> cuonic: you'd need to .validate() the new form
[17:14:20] <shoky> cuonic: and handle its submit event
[17:14:40] <xec_> yen_ and LindsayMac - please keep it friendly, we're all friends here. grouphug!
[17:14:52] <cuonic> shoky: I do don't I ? Line 175
[17:15:10] <shoky> cuonic: that runs on page load, no?
[17:15:16] <cuonic> shoky: Yes
[17:15:17] <LindsayMac> xec_:  sorry. It is just probably the must frustrating thing on the planet right now being pestered for an answer in MULTIPLE rooms for the same question
[17:15:21] <shoky> cuonic: not after you put in the new form..
[17:15:29] <yen_> xen_ i am lindsaymac has been just bullying me all day. thr is only so much a girl can take
[17:15:43] <LindsayMac> ok
[17:15:44] <cuonic> shoky: No, but that's what I don't understand, where to put it
[17:16:53] <yen_> xen_ sorry don't mean for you all to be a part of this.
[17:17:12] <shoky> cuonic: right after adding it to the DOM
[17:17:47] <cuonic> shoky: inside the window.setTimeout function() ?
[17:18:23] <xec_> sphinxxx: yeah i don't know why it's bugging. too much page for me to be able to debug completely though. if i was you i'd probably try the plugin on a completely fresh page to see if i could get it working there
[17:18:37] <shoky> cuonic: inside the callback, yes
[17:18:38] <kevinquinnyo> if i don't know the name of an id, like 'a id=dontknow', but i do know some of the style attributes, how might i find that
[17:18:47] <sphinxxx> xec_:  yea i took it from a demo html page and it works fine there :\
[17:18:52] <kevinquinnyo> find that id name that is
[17:18:54] <cuonic> shoky: Ok I'll try that and keep you posted
[17:19:39] <yen_> lindsaymac i thought this was a free forum , so im not sure why you are following me in different rooms. Besides, I am definitely not askin "you" the same question numerous times. In fact I asked you once, a while ago and u told me i was begging
[17:19:47] <LindsayMac> kevinquinnyo:   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2239567/jquery-check-if-element-has-css-attribute
[17:20:00] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i'm not. I'm just active in two rooms
[17:20:01] <kevinquinnyo> LindsayMac: thanks!
[17:20:03] <LindsayMac> this one and WP
[17:20:23] <yen_> lindsaymac that's not my problem them is it? how am i asking "you" the same question?
[17:20:35] <LindsayMac> yen_:  its time to drop it.
[17:20:41] <LindsayMac> you are cluttering up the room
[17:20:42] <cuonic> shoky: Ok, validation now works, just the submit isn't being caught. Do I put that in there too ?
[17:20:51] <yen_> then STOP calling people SPAZ.
[17:20:59] <shoky> cuonic: that'd work yeah
[17:21:02] <yen_> and stop bullying people
[17:21:18] <yen_> u have been bullying me all day, so hear me out straight right about now.
[17:21:34] <cuonic> shoky: By that'd work, do you mean it's a possibility, but there's better ? :P
[17:22:13] <yen_> LindsayMac you were bein v nice to me when TW2113 was helping me out, trying to pigyback off him. And nw u called me a "begger" for asking for help?
[17:22:33] <yen_> and they u call me a liar for no valid reason whatsoever?
[17:22:35] <Escherial> is the proper way to do a looping animation like this? function bounce() { $("#object").animate({ left: '-=10' }).animate({ left: '+=10' }, bounce); } bounce();
[17:22:35] <LindsayMac> yen_:  is this you dropping it?
[17:22:39] <shoky> cuonic: well, i'd maybe structure the code a bit differently so it's not a hassle to make these changes. you can always use a named function instead of an inline anonymous one
[17:22:50] <shoky> e.g. window.setTimeout(myCallback,2000)
[17:22:54] <LindsayMac> yen_:  i gave you the reasons why you have worn out your welcome with me. Its time to drop it
[17:22:55] <Escherial> the recursion looks a little iffy to me, since i'm concerned that the stack is going to get very deep after a while
[17:23:04] <yen_> lindsaymac this is me telling you to shut up and never take advantage of people for too long.
[17:23:12] <cuonic> shoky: Ok, trying the "throw it all in after the DOM addition" method :D
[17:23:20] <shoky> ;P
[17:24:02] <yen_> LindsayMac i gave you no such reason, to call me a spaz, a begger, a liar who drinks to much coffee? I am coming her to solver a problem and u interferre between me and tw2113?
[17:24:39] <yen_> LindsayMac and now u wanna drop cause finally after the entire day, I am upset?
[17:24:44] <yen_> LindsayMac awesome!
[17:25:15] <snover> enough.
[17:25:22] <snover> keep it on topic
[17:25:24] <snover> or go somewhere else
[17:25:53] <cuonic> shoky: You, have saved me from more hours of head scratching
[17:26:00] <cuonic> shoky: Thanks so much !!
[17:26:09] <shoky> ;]
[17:26:11] <yen_> <snover> go read the logs. make up your own mind. I may be saying a lot now. but i'll let u decide.
[17:26:15] <Escherial> so, anyone happen to know if that infinite recursion thing is ok?
[17:26:49] <shoky> Escherial: that is fine
[17:27:39] <shoky> Escherial: your bounce function will return immediately, the stack will be immediately released
[17:27:55] <shoky> it's not actual recursion
[17:30:23] <spaceonline>    how I make this in the version current?  $('a[href*=user/delete]').click(function(){ if (confirm("confirm delete ?"))  { $(this).preventDefault(); }  return false;  });
[17:30:50] <shoky> spaceonline: you dont .preventDefault() on $(this)
[17:31:06] <shoky> spaceonline:  .click(function(e) { ... e.preventDefault() ... })
[17:31:50] <shoky> er also what did you ask
[17:42:57] <berndj> besides martian gremlins, what could be stripping whitespace from a hidden form element? IE (i'm unconfident which version) and form plugin's formSerialize are in the playing field
[17:44:50] <defaultro> hi shoky
[17:47:21] <shoky> hi defaultro
[17:47:24] <shoky> and goodnight ;p
[17:47:34] <Atty> Im needing some help with fullcalendar and modals can I get someone to help me.
[17:47:43] <defaultro> you're leaving shoky?
[17:47:55] <mogaal> Hi people, I need your orientation. In Perl I do something like if ($var ~= /REGEX/) { }. How I do it in jquery/javascript ?
[17:49:59] <snover> ?101 @ mogaal
[17:50:08] <berndj> mogaal: /REGEX/.test(var)
[17:50:44] <mogaal> berndj: Ok, thanks!
[17:50:49] <mogaal> I'll test
[17:50:55] <berndj> mogaal, there's also var.match(/REGEX/)
[17:51:06] <mogaal> berndj: ohh that sounds great
[17:51:20] <berndj> i don't recall the difference - might be when you want to capture things
[17:52:32] * snover twitches
[17:53:55] <johnkpaul> berndj: test returns a boolean, match returns an array of matches IIRC
[17:55:00] <berndj> looks like YRC based on what grep found in some random js code
[18:00:21] <thomedy> hello has anyone gotten excanvas/<canvas> to work in ie
[18:00:31] <thomedy> im getting an error at line 176
[18:00:43] <godlfishh> hey how do i change this to use an image background, and can I use relative url so I don't have to put domain name in function?
[18:00:44] <godlfishh> $(this).css("backgroundColor", "blue");}
[18:00:53] <thomedy> and i console.logged out the error i think the parameter coming in as an argument is empty
[18:06:52] <johnkpaul> godlfishh: that's a css question
[18:06:57] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't care
[18:07:20] <johnkpaul> change backgroundColor to background and "blue" to "url(/your/path/to/file)"
[18:12:20] <godlfishh> i am using this, 			$(this).css("background-image", "url(/images/colors/pink.png)");}
[18:12:30] <godlfishh> but it is breaking my code :(
[18:13:06] <johnkpaul> what does "breaking my code" mean
[18:13:12] <johnkpaul> also, you don't need "-image"
[18:13:30] <godlfishh> well it worked before i changed it to this, and now i get o results, I will try removing image
[18:13:42] <manster> i'm using append to add the url path to my site title everytime a menu link is clicked, but right now there is a space i cant get rid of between my sitename and the appended item http://jordanstabile.webu.us/paint
[18:13:49] <johnkpaul> the css properties used in .css are camelcased
[18:13:55] <johnkpaul> not hyphen separated
[18:13:58] <manster> it looks like jquery puts my site name in a span and the appended text in its anchor
[18:14:06] <LindsayMac> a little OT, but since getting in to this, i find myself making lots of little revisions and doing the "save as" so I can go back and forth. Is there a text editor that does snapshots?
[18:14:10] <manster> how do i only get the text from my menu and tehn add that?
[18:16:05] <johnkpaul> manster: ask #css, this is a css question, something to do with having a text node next to that anchor
[18:16:18] <johnkpaul> I'd check to se eif there was whitespace there, but I don't have many details for you
[18:16:37] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: eclipse takes snapshots
[18:16:48] <johnkpaul> although I have rarely found it useful
[18:16:57] <LindsayMac> really johnkpaul ?
[18:17:08] <johnkpaul> really to what? :)
[18:17:10] <johnkpaul> both are true
[18:17:15] <LindsayMac> maybe because i''m new and i'm breaking and fixing and breaking again
[18:17:23] <LindsayMac> really to you not finding it useful
[18:17:27] <johnkpaul> ah
[18:17:38] <johnkpaul> well, eventually, the random nature of your breaking and fixing will go away
[18:17:45] <johnkpaul> as you get more comfortable with js/jquery/whatever
[18:17:46] <LindsayMac> yea I am sure...
[18:17:55] <LindsayMac> but i'm always going to be learning and fiddling with SOMETHING new..
[18:18:23] <johnkpaul> yeah, but by then, chances are, you'll udnerstand your environment well enough that you won't need to switch back, you'll just keep moving forward
[18:18:30] <LindsayMac> but yes.  can code in php and i probably would never use it.. although with CSS I might because you make a chance, or get an idea, it doesnt work so you go backwards
[18:18:50] <johnkpaul> eh, or you look up the css documentation, and read what _would_ work
[18:19:03] <johnkpaul> also, at least for code, there are unit tests to avoid much of this back and forth
[18:19:42] <LindsayMac> I'm talking about working VISUALLY or architecturally.
[18:19:47] <johnkpaul> everyone has their own way of developing, definitely, but #ofcontrolZs per unit time, goes down
[18:19:57] <johnkpaul> oh I see, yeah, taht's true, if you're doing the design as well
[18:20:00] <LindsayMac> you do it because you had an idea of a better way to organize, etc. then decide you didnt want to
[18:20:21] <LindsayMac> Most of my mock ups are done before hand but sometimes when you get into the code, I decide to switch it up
[18:20:45] <berndj> part of that snapshotting burden could/should be borne by your version control system. branches, if need be
[18:20:47] <johnkpaul> ah ok, yeah, that's a differnt case than me, I have very rarely made a decision like taht
[18:20:55] <LindsayMac> not saying i would use it forever.. but DEFINITELY for when I am learning.. that is for sure.
[18:20:59] <johnkpaul> berndj: I think that LindsayMac wants much more granular changes
[18:21:05] <LindsayMac> berndj:  version control is too broad
[18:21:21] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul is right.. i'm talking about little mini changes i wouldnt commit berndj
[18:21:58] <berndj> i see. i understand - i was just thinking of a longer feedback cycle
[18:22:45] <LindsayMac> berndj:  no.. i have versioning for that kinda stuff when it comes to bigger or collaborative projects.
[18:24:44] <berndj> also, i'm thinking git, where commits are so ridiculously cheap that i've tended to (ab)use it as a file transfer method
[18:26:44] * imsky versions everything
[18:27:14] <LindsayMac> ha
[18:36:01] <abjorn> imsky

[18:51:03] <Nacho> ok
[18:51:06] <Nacho> thank you anyway
[18:51:59] <imsky> abjorn, have you seen sorting on stackexchange sites? the bastards are using transforms to order elements instead of DOM position
[18:52:18] <johnkpaul> Nacho: http://www.webmuse.co.uk/blog/jquery-plugin-to-animate-scrolling-to-anchor/
[18:52:19] <imsky> abjorn, http://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#culture-traffic
[18:52:24] <johnkpaul> you can use that info to build it yourself
[18:52:29] <abjorn> :o
[18:52:51] <imsky> but only in chrome lol
[18:53:06] <Nacho> johnkpaul: yeah, I think I will have to code it myself
[18:53:45] <johnkpaul> imsky: that's using isotope
[18:53:53] <johnkpaul> they didn't come up with it
[18:53:55] <abjorn> werd, busy playing guitar tho
[18:54:03] <imsky> johnkpaul, lol i know
[18:54:11] <imsky> nice detective work brother
[18:54:18] <imsky> abjorn, enjoy it
[18:56:23] <johnkpaul> imsky: :) just thought they came up with something so fancy
[18:56:38] <imsky> johnkpaul, what

[19:51:01] <digs> I have this: $(function() { $(".someButton").button(); });
[19:51:44] <digs> It works fine on the page load... then I do an AJAX call and update some HTML on the page and add anotherButton...
[19:52:02] <digs> How do I then make: $(function() { $(".anotherButton").button(); }); work?
[19:53:16] <digs> Crap... why does asking the question usually lead me to an answer? I just realized I had that outside the success: of the ajax call :/
[19:53:21] <digs> So, thats how.
[19:55:44] <HEMI> So...Is there any possible way to use $.post() to execute a script that will actually interact with the outside world besides returning data to $.post? :(
[19:56:33] <systemfault> ?
[19:56:53] <coldhead> can you be more specific about "the outside world"?
[19:56:56] <systemfault> Define: Interact with de outside world
[19:57:40] <drdreed>  can anybody look at this code and help me figure out my problem?  http://pastebin.com/AaiXXK4L
[19:57:46] <systemfault> You couldâ€¦ if you had access launch a nuclear missile with $.post
[19:57:58] <drdreed> I am trying to validate the form before I submit it.  I need to make sure that an image has been assigned to 'image' as part of the validation though
[19:58:43] <systemfault> lol "sleep"
[19:59:15] <abjorn> coldhead: What's the sun
[19:59:19] <drdreed> haha take it easy on me
[19:59:32] <systemfault> drdreed: You deserve a fail medal for that :/
[19:59:39] <HEMI> As in I can't even get a script .post()ed to to throw an alert() that's visible or anything.
[19:59:41] <abjorn> lol "fresh air"
[19:59:51] <abjorn> lol "hygiene"
[20:00:42] <HEMI> I have a script I wrote...It works beautifully. It takes a URL, parses it up, does some SQL and offers a file based on the data returned from the database to the user. Of course, I ran into a "request-URI too long" problem today, cause some fucking scientist decided to try to generate a spreadsheet for FOUR THOUSAND entries.
[20:01:17] <HEMI> So now I need to figure out some other way to get all of this info into that script, hopefully without re-writing the whole damned thing.
[20:01:23] <drdreed> after submitting the form I am reloading the form but if it reloads too quickly the image is corrupted so i put in a "sleep" to insure that the picture came through.  is there a better way to do that?
[20:01:42] <systemfault> HEMI: Are you sending tons of data via a URL? (GET)?
[20:01:52] <systemfault> HEMI: You wouldn't have that problem with a POST
[20:02:01] <HEMI> systemfault: I didn't expect them to send that much data.
[20:02:09] <HEMI> And yes, that's why I'm trying to use $.post.
[20:02:23] <HEMI> But even some little test pages fail miserably.
[20:03:46] <systemfault> HEMI: You just need to adjust your server-side script to allow POST instead of get and it should work :/
[20:04:10] <systemfault> GET should only be used to "read"
[20:04:43] <HEMI> systemfault: should work, yes. But, like I said, I have a few simple test pages up and I can't even get an alert() to work from a page that's loaded via POST.
[20:08:52] <HEMI> http://www.puresimplicity.net/~hemi/test/post/test.php <-- If you load this, you'll see that it throws an alert.
[20:09:26] <HEMI> http://www.puresimplicity.net/~hemi/test/post/post-test.html <-- However, if you load this and click the button, which loads the previous page as a POST, you'll see that I get no alert.
[20:10:03] <digs> How would I make a div "flash"
[20:10:09] <digs> to draw attention to it.
[20:10:49] <digs> like the background is a solid color that stands out and then fades to transparent so that it looks normal again.
[20:11:06] <digs> like 1 second sort of timing.
[20:11:14] <systemfault> HEMI: I'm not sure what you're expecting.. It justs send a post HTTP request to the server via ajax
[20:11:44] <HEMI> Yeah...So there's no interaction with it outside of what I said earlier: the initial POST and the return from the script.
[20:12:19] <systemfault> HEMI: the .post returns the content of the webpageâ€¦ and that's about it, it won't change the page or execute its content
[20:13:00] <systemfault> HEMI: Why do you use ajax if you want to change page?
[20:13:28] <HEMI> Cause I'm taking shots in the dark trying to find a way to get lots of data into this page without re-writing the whole damned thing.
[20:13:48] <HEMI> At this point I might as well just write out a temp table in the database, pass the name of the table to the page and read the temp table in there. :(
[20:14:04] <HEMI> I'm open to other suggestions, obviously.
[20:16:12] <HEMI> Also, I DON'T want it to change the page. The script, in its original implementation, runs in a hidden frame anyway...All I want it to do is offer the file generated from what's passed in for download. That's it. I'm guessing that's not possible with a POST, though.
[20:18:54] <manster> hey guys any clue as to how to get rid of the extra space between my site title and the current page name. you'll see it where the slash "/" occurs http://jordanstabile.webu.us/fineart
[20:21:45] <Whirl3d> $.extend shouldn't modify the original object in my opinion, it should create a new object only. Just my opinion.
[20:22:42] <AnonymousPrime> manster check the letter-spacing on h1#site-name.site-and-title {
[20:23:04] <AnonymousPrime> when i remove that it spreads out a lot but it also evens up
[20:23:25] <mikehaas763> manster, not really a jquery question but I would try using a css reset. There are many but just google and pick one. It will probably mess up your current design but then you start fixing it with your own new css
[20:23:39] <systemfault> resets are bad...
[20:23:48] <systemfault> Normalize...
[20:23:57] <systemfault> (Google for normalize.css)
[20:24:06] <mikehaas763> I always use a css reset now, so that I don't get discrepancies between browsers
[20:24:19] <mikehaas763> Ok, so normalize is basically a reset
[20:24:43] <mikehaas763> and I disagree, I don't want the browser doing anything I don
[20:24:47] <mikehaas763> don't ask it to do
[20:24:58] <systemfault> No...
[20:25:06] <systemfault> A resets destroys everything...
[20:25:27] <systemfault> *reset
[20:26:57] <mikehaas763> ya it sets all margins to 0, etc. I don't want the browsers "handy, or useful" presets. I want my elements doing only what I have told them to do. It is definitely a preference thing though I'm not hating on normalize I just prefer a full reset.
[20:28:05] <AnonymousPrime> systemfault thx for the tip on normalize..that approach is new to me
[20:28:16] <systemfault> AnonymousPrime: You're welcome :)
[20:29:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gQP6a/8/    any ideas how I could make this function fail?
[20:29:20] <systemfault> About reset vs normalize: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6887336/what-is-the-different-between-normalize-css-and-reset-css
[20:30:24] <HEMI> I can have the script write out the file to the file system, then return the location of the script to the .post call, which can have a function to load a frame with the file location passed to it...
[20:30:57] <systemfault> HEMI: That's how it should be done
[20:32:26] <HEMI> systemfault: I've never written stuff that does things like this before. Uncharted waters for me.
[20:34:44] <systemfault> HEMI: instead of returning HTML from the server, send back JSON, something likeÂ  {"documentUrl" : "http://www.asdasdsad.com"} â€¦ Then in jQuery $.ajax({ url: 'test.php', type: 'POST', data: myData, dataType: 'json' }).done(function(data) { alert(data.documentUrl); });
[20:35:02] <systemfault> Of course.. do something more useful with data.documentUrl :P
[20:35:45] <HEMI> systemfault: yeah. :)
[20:37:44] <sluther> I have the following code: https://gist.github.com/7461cf79b1bfa7267434 getting errors about "unrecognized selector sent to instance". I know it's a memory/allocation issue, but not sure what offhandâ€¦ any ideas?
[20:37:52] <sluther> wrong channel, whoops ;)
[20:38:59] <systemfault> Damn Apple..
[20:39:20] <AnonymousPrime> sluther lol just did the same thing in the node.js channel
[20:39:28] <sluther> AnonymousPrime: good job. :D
[20:39:39] <sluther> in my defense, the right channel is the very next one up ;)
[20:40:04] <systemfault> I guess he wants to impress us with his Objective-Crap code :/
[20:40:15] <systemfault> Damn it's ugly..
[20:40:16] <AnonymousPrime> too much wine, too many channels, and yeah, textual jumped me a channel some how
[20:41:11] <mikehaas763> systemfault, I hear ya
[20:41:50] <mikehaas763> I have read countless stories of people who HATE their jobs with Objective C but stick with it for the money (app store)
[20:42:12] <AnonymousPrime> systemfault agreedâ€¦every time i try to sit down and get a handle on it i just shake my head wondering why anyone wants to ref objects 3 times :/
[20:42:17] <HEMI> I wonder if I could just write to the output stream directly in the return handler from .post...
[20:42:27] <HEMI> That would prevent me from needing to write files to the file system at all.
[20:42:31] <systemfault> Nobody would be using ObjC if it wasn't of Apple :P
[20:42:59] <systemfault> HEMI: Sure, just set the proper content type header.
[20:43:13] <systemfault> HEMI: You could send an image.. pdfâ€¦ anything.
[20:43:20] <HEMI> Have it return the file name and data...
[20:43:57] <HEMI> Or I could put together the file name before it even goes to the script, then just return the data...
[20:44:56] <HEMI> I think I'll just write out files for now, then work on the streaming later.
[20:45:25] <digs> If I have <div id=a1><input class=in></div> <div id=a2>...</div> <div class=foo><button.../></div> --- <div id=b1><input class=in></div> <div id=b2>...</div> <div class=foo><button.../></div> -- when I click on an respective button how do I go up the DOM and then into the div with the inputs?
[20:46:43] <digs> especially if I don't know the id of the div I am searching for... only that I know it is two parent equivalent levels up the DOM
[20:46:55] <AnonymousPrime> .parent().parent()
[20:47:28] <digs> eqivalent parents... meaing the div containing the button is at the same level as the two prior divs.
[20:47:35] <digs> equivalent*
[20:48:26] <AnonymousPrime> digs can you make a fiddle with the use case?
[20:50:23] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/7DZhA/
[20:50:30] <digs> was already doing that heh.
[20:50:45] <digs> when that button is clicked... how do I acces the input above it.
[20:50:49] <digs> access
[20:51:06] <systemfault> oh my :(
[20:51:13] <systemfault> Le bad markup :(
[20:51:55] <systemfault> $(this).parent().prev().prev().find('input') perhapsâ€¦
[20:51:59] <systemfault> But that's fugly.
[20:52:05] <digs> heh
[20:52:12] <digs> what would you do to clean it up?
[20:52:18] <ngharo> wrap em in a div
[20:52:32] <digs> that is what I was just thinking about ngharo.
[20:52:38] <systemfault> Try to group elements into blocks that have a meaning,.
[20:53:14] <digs> they do have meaning... all three of those divs belong to a single addres... there is the addres... the fedex verification and the controls for the address to delete or save it.
[20:53:30] <digs> then there are N addresses to a page.
[20:54:16] <systemfault> So, make groups (div) with a class "address"
[20:54:32] <systemfault> Then you could do: $(this).closest('.address').find('input')
[20:54:40] <systemfault> Which is already a bit better
[20:54:45] <digs> okay.
[20:54:48] <digs> Thanks for the help.
[20:55:27] <systemfault> Try to minimize the ids, use classes to give "semantic" to blocks then you can use betters functions to write good code
[20:55:41] <systemfault> For example, what is supposed to go inside the input?
[20:56:21] <digs> well there are multiple inputs for a full address company name etc.
[20:56:29] <digs> http://dev.fdanconia.com/los/upload/webform
[20:56:57] <digs> if you enter in something for the address city, state, zip... you will see the fedex verification when you exit the div.
[20:58:19] <digs> There is just a ton of interaction going on there and I got lost :/
[20:58:37] <systemfault> The fact that you abuse of ids doesn't help :(
[20:58:51] <HEMI> systemfault: do you have an example of a post return handler that will set proper content-type and let you stream output? :(
[20:58:52] <digs> can you elaborate?
[20:59:16] <systemfault> HEMI: It's server side stuff.. depends on your language..
[20:59:40] <HEMI> I'm using PHP for the server-side scripting.
[21:00:06] <martisj> anybody know how to customize the width of this widget: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[21:00:08] <martisj> ?
[21:03:00] <systemfault> digs: It would be a bit difficult to elaborate as I cannot really see the code (That website is an ocean of JS).. But if you used classes, you could easily use event delegation, you could easily get to the parent element having a address class then use find() to get to specific elements
[21:03:11] <systemfault> The code would likely be more robust and shorter.
[21:03:25] <digs> Okay. Well there are classes too.
[21:03:28] <digs> I just didn't put them.
[21:04:02] <digs> There are general classes for each type of div... then ids to know which div you are in since there may be up to 99 addresses on a page.
[21:04:24] <systemfault> HEMI: What is the format you want to send?
[21:04:39] <digs> maybe though perhaps a hidden input would have been better instead of numbered id's.
[21:04:58] <systemfault> digs: With event delegation, you can build your code to handle millions of addresses :P
[21:05:26] <systemfault> digs: You could have a data-id="" attribute on the parent element having a address class
[21:05:35] <digs> I have an address class.
[21:05:52] <digs> I suppose I should update the fiddle to reflect the true nature and try not to simplify so much one sec.
[21:05:57] <systemfault> digs: Then when you click on the button, you would just do: $(this).closest('.address').attr('data-id') to get the id.
[21:06:11] <systemfault> Perhaps :P
[21:07:11] <HEMI> systemfault: .csv and .xls...Either, depending on what gets built. I know what's going to get built ahead of time.
[21:08:47] <digs> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/7DZhA/1/
[21:08:48] <systemfault> It can be binary so.. hmm, perhaps you should POST to a hidden iframe then
[21:08:56] <systemfault> that would trigger the download dialog.
[21:09:20] <HEMI> Yeah, that's what I'm going to do...Probably just send the file location to a script that will set header types properly and offer the file for download.
[21:11:51] <digs> Does that make sense why I did what I did now systemfault ? - If it is still all bass-ackwards... please do let me know... now is the time to fix it.
[21:12:17] <systemfault> digs: http://jsfiddle.net/7DZhA/2/
[21:12:37] <systemfault> Hmm
[21:12:49] <systemfault> digs:  give me 2 seconds
[21:13:03] <digs> okay
[21:19:53] <systemfault> digs: Sorryâ€¦ I had to go somewhere.. But I only had the time to do a small code :/ http://jsfiddle.net/7DZhA/3/
[21:20:27] <systemfault> I can't say the names are good.. but you get the idea.
[21:21:10] <digs> yeah I do.
[21:21:23] <digs> Thanks for taking the time.
[21:22:38] <systemfault> When you use event delegation (What I did), you can add more addresses dynamically and you won't need to rebind your events
[21:23:51] <digs> the difference is so subtle.
[21:24:34] <digs> But I see what you are saying, (I think), and I will need to research this idea a bit more.
[21:24:43] <digs> Thanks again for taking the time to enlighten me.
[21:24:58] <digs> I am still such a n00b.

[21:51:29] <kurol> oh my darling
[22:02:23] <subhojit777> I am scanning a csv file for data using JavaScript. The csv file consists of stock and company names, the code will scan for stock name starting with input, then company name starting with input, then stock name containing the input and finally company name containing the input. It requires four if-else conditions. The CSV file consists of 6500 records, naturally the whole thing have slowed down.. I have thought of using switch case but case require
[22:02:24] <subhojit777> s a constant value, so I have dropped that idea. Please help to speed up the code, any changes in csv file for speeding up the code is acceptable.
[22:04:39] * HEMI sighs.
[22:04:52] <HEMI> Apparently I can't get my read-only DocumentRoot to let me write out files anywhere temporarily.
[22:04:53] <HEMI> This sucks.

[22:07:43] <trailbar> hi, the documentation says .delegate has been replaced by .on, but how do i use it to emulate .delegate?
[22:08:07] <trailbar> the documentation also says .on binds to elements that currently exist, but .delegate binds to all elements - now or in future
[22:08:14] <granden> Hmm, when surfing the web for jquery stop watch, with miliscends support I come up pretty much empty handed. Anyone know of a good working plugin?
[22:09:25] <olinux> my $.ajax() has success:function (data, textStatus) {$("#comments").html(data);},
[22:09:56] <olinux> but #comments is not getting populated with the returned html, no errors show in console
[22:10:32] <olinux> how can i troublwshoot
[22:11:10] <dfg_> trailbar: where does the documentation say .delegate has been replaced by .on?
[22:11:12] <dfg_> "For help in converting from older jQuery event methods, see .bind(), .delegate(), and .live()."
[22:11:22] <dfg_> see live()
[22:11:26] <dfg_> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:11:56] <dfg_> oh, sorry, I completely misread the docs.
[22:12:04] <dfg_> Please ignore these comments. ^^ sorry again.-
[22:12:39] <trailbar> dfg_: sorry, 'superseded'
[22:13:02] <trailbar> don't want to mince, terms, i took that to mean i should be using on in stead of delegate, but maybe it doesn't?
[22:13:19] <dfg_> yeah, it does, that was my error. sorry x 3.
[22:14:01] <trailbar> no worries :] but but yeah my question still stands - should i just keep using delegate dyou think?
[22:17:47] <coldhead> you cheated on your anniversary
[22:17:53] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:18:40] <_zoggy_> !bash
[22:18:41] <dfg_> trailbar: you mighrt want to see section "Direct and delegated events" in the doc for .on()
[22:25:42] <trailbar> dfg_: yeah i'm reading that but it has me way confused - infact experimenting with .on now suggests it is binding to all elements - now or future
[22:27:11] <dfg_> as far as I can read (but please confirm yourself with the doc): on, by default, binds to the elements existing in the page when it was invoked
[22:28:12] <dfg_> but when passed the "selector" parameter (see parameter list) it will apply the selector when the event is raised (effectively applying to the objects that will be in the html at that moment)
[22:32:34] <trailbar> dfg_: yeah that's how i understand that doc as well
[22:33:00] <trailbar> dfg_: thing is in the .delegate() documentation it then shows an example of on/delegate code that is equivalent
[22:33:40] <dfg_> and...?
[22:35:22] <trailbar> well i'm trying to figure out how they can be equivalent if on binds to existing elements only but delegate binds to existing and future
[22:36:25] <dfg_> in the exmple you can see it's given the selector parameter
[22:36:53] <dfg_> [07:28] <dfg_> when passed the "selector" parameter (see parameter list) it will apply the selector when the event is raised (effectively applying to the objects that will be in the html at that moment)
[22:37:34] <trailbar> both of them are given the selector parameter
[22:41:58] <dfg_>                                                                          ^^^^
[22:46:11] <Wildbat> hi, anyone have idea how to fix this ? http://jsfiddle.net/PfnwT/3/
[22:46:40] <Wildbat> the button generate a oppose result
[22:47:17] <Wildbat> was it a bug or it is supposed to do that ?
[22:57:09] <HEMI> Well, hot damn...My script now returns a path to the file written to the file system. I think this is going to work.
[23:01:59] <ch3mical> Playing with FileSystem API?
[23:03:37] <HEMI> No...The reads and writes are being done with PHP; I'm just handling the passing of data back and forth with jQuery's .post method.
[23:05:16] <ch3mical> Oh OK
[23:13:46] <samholmes> is there a way to make an event cancelable?
[23:16:56] <samholmes> $(document).on('click', 'a[rev=form]', foo);
[23:17:09] <samholmes> <a href='..' onclick='return false;'>...
[23:17:25] <samholmes> whent the link is clicked, foo still gets dispatched.
[23:17:42] <samholmes> foo still gets triggered
[23:18:09] <samholmes> How do I prevent foo from being triggered from within the onclick attribute?
[23:22:43] <olinux> samholmes, http://api.jquery.com/off/
[23:25:00] <samholmes> olinux: I don't want to remove the foo handler.
[23:25:16] <samholmes> I just want to prevent it from triggering from within the onclick attrubute
[23:25:32] <kdoole> samholmes, does it need to be the onclick attribute?
[23:25:33] <samholmes> onclick=' return prompt("Stop or go?"); "
[23:25:45] <samholmes> kdoole: Preferable, but it doesn't have to be I suppose.
[23:26:12] <kdoole> you could add a data-attribute and add a simple test inside your click handler
[23:26:33] <samholmes> inside foo?
[23:26:53] <samholmes> That would be a very hacky solution.
[23:26:53] <kdoole> if ( #el.data('stop') === '0' ) return false
[23:27:26] <Wildbat> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[23:28:26] <ch3mical> ?stoppropagation @ samholmes
[23:28:29] <kdoole> it's no hackier than using an onclick, is it?
[23:28:35] <ch3mical> erm
[23:28:40] <ch3mical> yeah
[23:28:50] <kdoole> it would work
[23:29:23] <samholmes> kdoole: onclick is irrelavent, I could ask the same thing with a .on handler
[23:32:28] <kdoole> samholmes: interesting. so you're trying to trigger the click but not trigger the event? don
[23:32:35] <mazzachre> Anyone using the "timers" plugin? Is it stable and dependable?
[23:32:38] <kdoole> 't think i understand the goal
[23:34:33] <samholmes> kdoole: I'm trying to put another listener _in front_ of the document delegated listener, and I'm trying to control whether the delegated listener gets triggered from within this event using confirm().
[23:37:06] <samholmes> event.stopPropagation() worked

[23:37:11] <kdoole> samholmes: aah, i see.
[23:39:25] <HEMI> HOly cow, this big mess all WORKS.
[23:39:41] <HEMI>     $.post("export-test.php", { 'type': type, 'id[]': rowIDs },
[23:39:41] <HEMI>         function(data) {
[23:39:41] <HEMI>             targetURL = "download.php?type="+type+"&loc="+data.loc+"&name="+data.name;
[23:39:41] <HEMI>             parent.csvExport.location.replace(targetURL);
[23:39:41] <HEMI>         }, "json");
[23:39:47] <HEMI> I'm actually fairly impressed with it. :)
[23:55:21] <ch3mical> samholmes: you're welcome :)
[23:55:52] <EnginA> any idea why wouldn't .draggable({cancel: 'selector'}); wouldn't work ?
[23:55:53] <samholmes> ch3mical: XD
[23:55:59] <EnginA> ok, now, that was a bad question
[23:57:05] <HEMI> systemfault: thanks for your help. :)
[23:57:39] <systemfault> :P
[23:58:17] <soee> hi, i have such code: $("body").delegate("a.deleteE", "click", function(e){ ... } and why if i use $(this).attr("href") inside i have window object not link reference ?
[23:59:14] <HEMI> systemfault: do you think my solution is acceptable, or would you do it differently?
[23:59:53] <HEMI> Also, my thanks was serious...You pointed me in the direction I went, and it works really well.
