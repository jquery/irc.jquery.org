[00:09:17] <ecthiender> hello, i'd like to know how i can animate the box shadow property of an element.
[00:10:04] <ecthiender> I mean i there any jquery notation for box-shadow like marginLeft borderWidth etc..
[00:22:47] <deadly_jquery> hi, anyone know how to get the number of lines in textarea
[00:33:19] <faraway> deadly_jquery: i think you could count the \n in the textarea
[00:33:21] <kobabep> morning to all
[00:36:53] <kobabep> i have a question: i want to build a simple page where there are radio boxes (or check boxex), near these text areas filed, and at the bottom a large text area. When i click on a check box, an action write the word related with this check box in the large text area at the bottom. In this way i write a text only with check box, a text that after I can copy and past in other places
[00:37:02] <kobabep> is this possible with jquery?
[00:37:17] <kobabep> is there some way better?
[00:40:08] <faraway> kobabep: if you just want to "write" words in a text area the user clicks on and don't need the checkbox functionality  you could just surround the words with spans.
[00:40:14] <faraway> !paste
[00:41:21] <deadly_jquery> faraway: can u please look into, http://pastebin.com/wGBGmNp9
[00:42:36] <deadly_jquery> i am trying to print line numbers in the div, so trying to count the number of lines.  but when i hit the return key, it is not getting updtaed
[00:44:30] <Kambfhase> deadly_jquery: try .val() instead of .html()
[00:45:41] <Kambfhase> plus, use [] instead of new Array()
[00:50:27] <ecthiender> hello, i'd like to know what is the notation for box-shadow in jquery. i want to animate the box-shadow property using animate function of jquery.
[00:51:00] <ecthiender> like for margin-left jquery notation is marginLeft border-width is borderWidth etc
[00:51:20] <ecthiender> can anyone help me with box-shadow animation?
[00:52:10] <kobabep> faraway thank you
[00:53:14] <kobabep> faraway is there a guide to do this?
[00:53:48] <kobabep> have you a link to send me, please? I'm a novice, i want to start from zero
[00:54:26] <coldhead> ?g jqfundamentals @ kobabep
[00:54:27] <bot-t> kobabep, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[00:54:42] <Kambfhase> ecthiender: afaik you can use both, box-shadow and boxShadow. not sure you can animate box-shadow though
[00:54:43] <faraway> kobabep: https://pastee.org/qeyyc
[00:55:26] <kobabep> thanks coldhead and faraway
[00:55:55] <ecthiender> Kambfhase, yeah so thats what i wanted to know. i can't seem to animate the boxshadow property
[00:56:51] <blackspotwiggins> ecthiender, use css3 transitions
[00:57:03] <blackspotwiggins> browsers that have box-shadow usually have that as well
[00:57:34] <ecthiender> hmm. thanks blackspotwiggins
[00:57:38] <faraway> ecthiender: afaik some browser still have problems with animating shadows. (artifacts where parts of the shadow remain on the page)
[00:58:17] <ecthiender> so the advice is to avoid animating shadows?
[00:58:33] <blackspotwiggins> wtf, no
[00:58:46] <blackspotwiggins> using transitions for box-shadow works perfectly
[00:58:54] <ecthiender> oh okay. faraway said something like that i thought
[00:59:22] <ecthiender> okay blackspotwiggins .
[00:59:46] <faraway> ecthiender: try it with she browser versions, if it is all fine, then it is ok
[00:59:55] <faraway> ecthiender: the browsers
[01:00:03] <ecthiender> yeah got it faraway
[01:00:54] <darkangel> Is it possible to indicate in HTML which tab to select by default? (jqueryui tabs)
[01:01:12] <faraway> ecthiender: http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2011/07/19/what-s-new-in-opera-development-snapshots-14-july-2011
[01:01:36] <faraway> ecthiender: there it was
[01:01:49] <faraway> ecthiender: but probably it was only a dev preview
[01:02:09] <ecthiender> hmm faraway
[01:04:02] <blackspotwiggins> huh
[01:04:17] <blackspotwiggins> dev snapshot from july doesnt work -> dont use it
[01:04:18] <blackspotwiggins> makes sense
[01:05:02] <deadly_jquery> Kambfhase: thanks,  its working.
[01:05:25] <ecthiender> okay actually i'm not familiar with css3. so let me have a look around for a while.
[01:05:27] <Kambfhase> :)
[01:05:31] <deadly_jquery> i was trying to join("<BR>") instead of ("\n")
[01:05:55] <dgx> How do I test if an element has a class? if($('element').hasClass('class') == true) ?
[01:05:56] <deadly_jquery> bye
[01:07:04] <blackspotwiggins> haha
[01:07:07] <blackspotwiggins> hit and run at its finest
[01:08:33] <filename> hi
[01:08:46] <filename> anyone can help with jquery $.get?
[01:09:44] <blackspotwiggins> ?anyone @ filename
[01:09:44] <bot-t> filename, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[01:09:56] <filename> ok
[01:10:24] <filename> i have my site tested on localhost and everyting loads fine with $.get() but in IE i got error status = 0 (you're offline)
[01:10:27] <filename> IE 8
[01:10:38] <filename> fine in mozilla/chrome
[01:11:46] <filename> but i don't found descriptions of ajaxSetup statuses, just found some page descriebing it and status of 0 meaning 'you're offline'
[01:11:59] <filename> i tryed to minimize all securitty settings in IE but this dont help
[01:12:44] <cwl> cwl: if anyones got time to try and assist with an issue I've been unable to fix, much appreciated - http://jsfiddle.net/YVqAA/2/
[01:14:13] <coppa> cw1 : mootools is the js loaded in your fiddle
[01:14:17] <coppa> maybe that helps
[01:14:23] <blackspotwiggins> filename, maybe you are in offline mode?
[01:14:36] <filename> no, i am online
[01:14:45] <filename> i mean checkbox is unchecked
[01:14:50] <filename> about offline mode
[01:15:17] <blackspotwiggins> it's an ie error, google for that
[01:15:21] <xp_prg> anyone good at jquery ui here?
[01:15:22] <blackspotwiggins> dont know from top of my head
[01:15:31] <filename> yeah i googled for about 2 hours...
[01:15:43] <cwl> coppa: sorry its jquery. just updated it, http://jsfiddle.net/YVqAA/4/
[01:16:29] <filename> blackspotwiggins has $.ajax() diffent logic than $.get ?
[01:16:39] <filename> or $.get() is just alias
[01:16:39] <blackspotwiggins> no
[01:16:43] <filename> ok
[01:16:44] <blackspotwiggins> $.get is just a wrapper
[01:16:44] <coppa> cwl: don't understand the point of the js
[01:16:55] <coppa> what you want to do
[01:17:44] <coppa> btw anyone : you know how you can force the keyboard to display and focus on an element in mobile browsers
[01:17:45] <coppa> ?
[01:18:03] <blackspotwiggins> coppa, .focus() not working?
[01:18:08] <coppa> nop
[01:18:16] <coppa> click nieather
[01:18:41] <cwl> coppa: i added a long comment to my html? if you look at the result, the link for each picture is the same for all.
[01:18:44] <blackspotwiggins> you can only get the keyboard for inputs and the like i think
[01:18:56] <blackspotwiggins> cwl, write html with right links?
[01:19:03] <blackspotwiggins> why are you using js for something that stupid
[01:19:03] <xp_prg> is there a way to develop a ui graphically and have it just write all the code for jquery to execute it/build it?
[01:19:04] <Ricoshady> anyone know what this means? "error-attempt-to-run-compile-and-go-script-on-a-cleared-scope"
[01:19:43] <Ricoshady> i started getting that error, when I start outputing the same html, in a document.write() call
[01:20:03] <blackspotwiggins> Ricoshady, using document.write() is a bad sign already
[01:20:13] <Ricoshady> why?
[01:20:27] <blackspotwiggins> you are not supposed to use it
[01:20:35] <Ricoshady> why not?
[01:20:38] <blackspotwiggins> it overwrites the page when it's loaded
[01:20:42] <blackspotwiggins> and blocks errything when loading
[01:20:57] <blackspotwiggins> whatever you are trying to use it for, there is a better way
[01:21:15] <blackspotwiggins> it's an outdated practice from 90s
[01:21:25] <Ricoshady> i know, im using it in a new way
[01:21:36] <blackspotwiggins> ?gl @ Ricoshady
[01:21:37] <bot-t> Ricoshady, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[01:22:13] <cwl> blackspotwiggins: stupid to you maybe.
[01:22:37] <Ricoshady> i have a good use for it
[01:22:39] <Ricoshady> really good
[01:22:44] <Ricoshady> very powerful
[01:23:12] <coldhead> that's what hitler said
[01:23:17] <Ricoshady> hah
[01:23:24] <Ricoshady> let me exaplin and then you can chime in
[01:23:27] <coppa> cw1 : blackspotwiggins got a point really : I don't see the need of javascript in your fiddle
[01:23:48] <coppa> just do <a><img></a> instead of <a></a><img> and that's it
[01:24:13] <coppa> <coldhead> that's what hitler said LOL
[01:24:56] <Kambfhase> lol @ coldhead
[01:25:27] <Ricoshady> my server caches pages, and when you have an area of the page like a login|logout, normally that has to hit a server to explore a session to know. but I keep a simple cookie in the browser that show wether you're logged in or not. it doesn't actually authenticte you by anymeans, but instead of having to send pages to the backend to figure that out, or use ESI, this work perfect. just a little code, tons of server gain.
[01:25:41] <cwl> coppa: you see, i have already put it like this <a><img></a> but it only works in IE, neither FF, chrome. it comes from cssplay.
[01:26:25] <Ricoshady> inline I can make choice purely in the browser
[01:26:28] <coppa> cw1 nop in your fiddle it is <a></a><img>
[01:26:29] <Ricoshady> choices
[01:26:48] <blackspotwiggins> Ricoshady, that sounds very fragile
[01:26:55] <Ricoshady> how so?
[01:27:01] <cwl> cwl: ok'will change it now. but i have tried that locally and it worked in IE only
[01:27:05] <Ricoshady> the code is actually really small
[01:27:16] <Ricoshady> totally isolated to a js function
[01:27:18] <blackspotwiggins> you are creating tons of complexity for negligible gain
[01:27:31] <blackspotwiggins> and you are using document.write()
[01:27:34] <Ricoshady> its not that complex really
[01:27:40] <Ricoshady> a few lines of code
[01:27:44] <blackspotwiggins> what if i fake the cookie?
[01:27:48] <blackspotwiggins> or you update the code?
[01:28:18] <Ricoshady> then perhaps you get a logout link when you shouldn't, big deal...
[01:28:28] <blackspotwiggins> as i said before
[01:28:31] <blackspotwiggins> good luck with that dude
[01:29:03] <Ricoshady> its not as complex as you think, and can save the backend server a ton of processing time
[01:29:17] <Ricoshady> let varnish push the whole thing out, never hits apache
[01:29:18] <blackspotwiggins> i dont care
[01:29:25] <clu3> i have a jquery object  $foo, and a selector string selector = "parent().next()", how can i find out $foo.parent().next() from $foo & selector ?
[01:29:25] <cwl> coppa: http://jsfiddle.net/YVqAA/5/
[01:29:28] <Ricoshady> haha i love hard heads
[01:29:32] <blackspotwiggins> you are doing something completely retarded IMO
[01:30:08] * NodeX shudders at apache
[01:30:27] <Ricoshady> you've only just said you don't use it, but no really bad reason for using it
[01:31:20] <coppa> cwl: if you then remove all the js, you don't get what you want ?
[01:32:13] <Ricoshady> but blackspotwiggins, despite our difference, you mentioned something that might point to my problem. so document write overwrite everything? in what sense?
[01:32:58] <blackspotwiggins> Ricoshady, try it?
[01:33:18] <xp_prg> nobody answers my question and openly urinates on my question
[01:33:24] <Ricoshady> i have tried it, i don't see it overwriting anything
[01:33:46] <NodeX> xp_prg : what's the question
[01:33:59] <Ricoshady> there is no visable difference to me when loading the page
[01:34:03] <xp_prg> is there like qtdesigner for jqueryui pages?
[01:34:05] <blackspotwiggins> Ricoshady, go to any webpage
[01:34:08] <blackspotwiggins> open console
[01:34:11] <xp_prg> or do I have to do it all by hand like a bitch?
[01:34:14] <blackspotwiggins> write document.write(123)
[01:34:17] <blackspotwiggins> press enter
[01:34:18] <blackspotwiggins> magic
[01:34:30] <blackspotwiggins> xp_prg, like a bitch
[01:34:33] <apollo13> xp_prg: the later, I hope you get paid well :Ã¾
[01:34:57] <Ricoshady> im looking at it now, what about it?
[01:35:11] <Ricoshady> nothign about document.write
[01:35:13] <xp_prg> apollo13 I do get paid for being a bitch that is the good news
[01:35:36] <apollo13> I think you still could work on your language
[01:35:41] <blackspotwiggins> it replaces the page with 123
[01:35:48] <blackspotwiggins> @ Ricoshady
[01:35:54] <blackspotwiggins> no problem for you?
[01:36:03] <blackspotwiggins> why am i even trying to argue with you, geez
[01:36:10] <Ricoshady> im not, honestly
[01:37:12] <Ricoshady> you merely said to go to any page, my test site that is using document.write(), opened the console... nothing...
[01:37:31] <Ricoshady> id just like to know what you mean by it overwrite the page?
[01:37:59] <xp_prg> does anyone do websockets here, what is the easiest server side framework to use to do that?
[01:38:14] <xp_prg> python is being a bitch on the rag about it
[01:38:27] <Cork> xp_prg: python or golang
[01:38:28] <Ricoshady> honestly, if I thought it was a bad idea I wouldnt use it... but you havent really said anything bad about it, just mostly not to use it because... of X?
[01:38:40] <blackspotwiggins> Ricoshady, http://jsbin.com/uvoyet/#javascript,html
[01:38:43] <xp_prg> Cork what pypi module in python?
[01:38:53] <Ricoshady> thanks, ill read
[01:38:54] <xp_prg> Cork do you use port 80 or some other port?
[01:39:00] <NodeX> xp_prg : probably the easiest atm is node.js
[01:39:06] <cwl> coppa: yes, but can't it be done with jquery too? the script worked with the <a></a><img>, i just don;t know how to get it to .wrap the next url to the next image being transversed
[01:39:15] <xp_prg> that is what I heard NodeX, but can node.js interface with mysql and stuff?
[01:39:19] <jayflux> the slideTo(); function that github uses, is there a jQuery plugin for that?
[01:39:28] <Cork> xp_prg: the port doesn't really matter, you can pick what ever port you like
[01:39:33] <NodeX> cwl : siblings()
[01:39:36] <Ricoshady> blackspot
[01:39:45] <blackspotwiggins> Ricoshady, still not seeing it?
[01:39:46] <Cork> xp_prg: haven't used the python version my self, but i know many use it as a reference server
[01:39:46] <Ricoshady> you're using that in a totally specific way
[01:39:50] <xp_prg> Cork I want it to use 80
[01:39:55] <blackspotwiggins> THATS WHAT I TOLD YOU!!11
[01:39:55] <Ricoshady> yes I do see it
[01:39:56] <blackspotwiggins> ffs
[01:40:04] <Ricoshady> that isnt at all what im doing hahaha
[01:40:13] <xp_prg> python pyramid made children cry trying to use it
[01:40:19] <Ricoshady> yea, that will... Im not doing that... im using document.write() in line
[01:40:20] <blackspotwiggins> you didnt even try the console thing, did you
[01:40:21] <Ricoshady> hahah
[01:40:27] <xp_prg> supposed to make stargate load or something, its all crazy
[01:40:34] <Ricoshady> you're calling it after the page loads
[01:40:36] <Ricoshady> im not
[01:40:41] <blackspotwiggins> you know what, go revel in your ignorance
[01:40:57] <Ricoshady> me? you're the one that just came up with a retarded example heh
[01:41:14] <Ricoshady> anyway, sorry guys
[01:41:17] <blackspotwiggins> if you read what i said earlier, i specifically told that it happens WHEN THE PAGE IS LOADED
[01:41:20] <coldhead> no, we're sorry
[01:41:30] <blackspotwiggins> it blocks rendering otherwise
[01:41:52] <Ricoshady> blackspotwiggins, you're example clearly class document.write() WAY AFTER the page loads
[01:42:00] <Ricoshady> clearly calls
[01:42:08] <blackspotwiggins> and Ricoshady congrats, you made the ignore list
[01:42:49] <Ricoshady> wow, hes passionate
[01:42:55] <Ricoshady> i like that
[01:43:18] <NodeX> Ricoshady : what are you trying to achieve
[01:43:23] <NodeX> or what do you need help with
[01:43:43] <cwl> NodeX:  its already being called inside an iteration, so dont think its going to work
[01:43:47] <jamesbrink1> hey guys, i need an indeterminate progress bar like this one on jquery-ui site http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/images/pbar-ani.gif
[01:43:53] <NodeX> cwl yes it will
[01:43:58] <jamesbrink1> but i need a blue one, they are not included in themes
[01:44:06] <Ricoshady> NodeX, im getting this error "error-attempt-to-run-compile-and-go-script-on-a-cleared-scope"
[01:44:09] <jamesbrink1> any ideas where i might find an animated one like that?
[01:44:16] <Ricoshady> im trying to tricky things, and managing to pull that off
[01:44:22] <Ricoshady> im trying some
[01:44:23] <Ricoshady> i mean
[01:44:33] <NodeX> and what triggers that error
[01:45:31] <NodeX> it's a FF only error iirc and it's in regards to referencing a window that is closed or non existent
[01:45:56] <Ricoshady> basically... im experimenting with outpuing the exact same html code via document write (inline in script tags) itsead of standard HTML, a form with some ajax tied to it. in FF it throw that error, IE it works.
[01:46:15] <NodeX> can you pastebin the code ?
[01:46:35] <Ricoshady> ill try, its spread across a couple files
[01:46:51] <Ricoshady> this is a out there one
[01:47:31] <NodeX> do you really need to use document.write .. it's evil lol
[01:47:49] <Ricoshady> in blackspotwiggins example, hes using some dom element inline... i didnt know you could do that.
[01:47:52] <Spadeski> Ricoshady in your ajac and php try removing all extra  new
[01:47:54] <Spadeski> l ines before and after the php statement tags
[01:49:11] <Ricoshady> so if you do something like this... http://pastebin.com/qxrNCZaD inline... it act like document write?
[01:49:22] <Ricoshady> it iwll I mean
[01:50:05] <NodeX> depends if it's called after #hello was rendered
[01:50:30] <NodeX> better to use try and catch
[01:50:45] <Ricoshady> rendered? does the dom need to have been created?
[01:51:06] <NodeX> yes it needs to have a top level in it
[01:51:22] <NodeX> is that all your page has on it ?
[01:51:49] <aaronmcadam> how can you query the dom for an element if the dom hasn't been created ;)
[01:51:57] <NodeX> ^ ^
[01:52:08] <aaronmcadam> you need that in a ready block too
[01:52:10] <quicksilver> getDOMElementFromTheFuture()
[01:52:24] <aaronmcadam> askDocBrownToGetMyElement()
[01:52:26] <NodeX> hit 88 MPh and the flux capacitor kicks in
[01:52:32] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[01:52:57] <aaronmcadam> "Martyyyy we got DOM Level 4 in 2030" :D
[01:53:08] <NodeX> $.fn.fluxCapcitor=function()return dom.node.that.not.exists.yet;
[01:53:09] <NodeX> lol
[01:53:15] <aaronmcadam> In Soviet russia DOM queries you!
[01:53:24] <blackspotwiggins> maybe its neutrino dom
[01:53:27] <blackspotwiggins> faster than light!
[01:53:28] <Ricoshady> NodeX, all I was asking blackspotwiggins, was why he thought it was so evel
[01:53:30] <Ricoshady> evil
[01:53:41] <NodeX> document.write is evil period
[01:53:50] <blackspotwiggins> you have dom before you even make the request
[01:53:51] <Ricoshady> ok ok, but explain some of the reasons
[01:53:52] <aaronmcadam> if u know what you're doing
[01:53:56] <NodeX> if you are manipulating DOM's you need a DOM to manipulate
[01:54:20] <NodeX> There is alot of google material but the main reason is that it's blocking
[01:54:32] <aaronmcadam> ?cc
[01:54:32] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[01:54:33] <NodeX> the js engine is in sleep while it writes
[01:54:43] <Kambfhase> DOM: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Hamburg_Dom_08.jpg/220px-Hamburg_Dom_08.jpg
[01:54:53] <NodeX> and JS being a mainly Async language it's a bad idea to block
[01:55:08] <Ricoshady> so what kind of weird things can happen
[01:55:09] <NodeX> (async nowerdays anyway)
[01:55:27] <aaronmcadam> it needed to be async because of browsers yupyup
[01:55:41] <aaronmcadam> you can't have blocking actions otherwise the ui thread would lock
[01:55:48] <NodeX> each browser (engine) differs .. IEx obviously allows what you are doing ... FF engine (spidermonkey or w/e) obvisouly has better checks
[01:56:23] <NodeX> what are you trying to achieve .. maybe there is a better way ?
[01:56:35] <blackspotwiggins> there is, he is just so stubborn
[01:56:43] <aaronmcadam> I dunno what's wrong with him just using the jq api,,,
[01:56:55] <Ricoshady> hah really relax blackspotwiggins , I just like to understand what is really going on
[01:56:58] <aaronmcadam> $('#hello').text('Hello pricks');
[01:57:08] <jiduvah> should I be using a different .js file for each html file I use?
[01:57:16] <blackspotwiggins> between him and the guy who cant use variables and holds all his data in dom..
[01:57:22] <blackspotwiggins> this place is diverse :)
[01:57:24] <NodeX> jiduvah : need more context than that
[01:57:32] <Ricoshady> aaronmcadam, nothing... persay
[01:57:49] <cwl> nodex, no luck. thanks anyway
[01:58:05] <Ricoshady> blackspotwiggins, you gotta relax, im only asking questions as to why its bad, and you get all up and arms... just chil
[01:58:07] <NodeX> cwl : then you are using it wrong .. pastebin your code
[01:58:14] <Ricoshady> hah
[01:58:16] <Ricoshady> man
[01:58:34] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins is lovely, leave him alone :)
[01:58:40] <jiduvah> Nodex: sorry I am new to it, I am actually using phonegap and jquery mobile, I start off with a listview then take the id of the item and go to a second html page to load another list view specific to the id that was selected
[01:58:46] <Ricoshady> : )
[01:58:58] <aaronmcadam> jiduvah: #jquerymobile
[01:59:14] <Ricoshady> so, what is the best, faster alternative to using document.write()... i dont want the page to load, and see a bunch of test moving around
[01:59:27] <aaronmcadam> jiduvah probably best to just keep ur js in one file
[01:59:28] <Ricoshady> "fastest" I mean
[01:59:40] <Ricoshady> i dont have to use document.write() if its so bad
[01:59:40] <aaronmcadam> it will be cached when you land on the homepage
[01:59:55] <aaronmcadam> just don't use it
[01:59:56] <Ricoshady> if I can use a good alternative.
[02:00:02] <NodeX> Ricoshady : I don't understand what you are trying to do or why so I can't really recommend
[02:00:11] <aaronmcadam> the jQuery API Ricoshady
[02:00:13] <jiduvah> arronmcadam: ok thanks, I guess I just needed to know if you can do either or
[02:00:24] <aaronmcadam> you can of course do either
[02:00:24] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, <Ricoshady> my server caches pages, and when you have an area of the page like a login|logout, normally that has to hit a server to explore a session to know. but I keep a simple cookie in the browser that show wether you're logged in or not. it doesn't actually authenticte you by anymeans, but instead of having to send pages to the backend to figure that out, or use ESI, this work perfect. just a little code, tons of serv
[02:00:24] <blackspotwiggins> er gain.
[02:00:33] <blackspotwiggins> if that makes sense
[02:00:36] <aaronmcadam> I use backbone.js for my jqm project jiduvah
[02:00:41] <NodeX> jiduvah : most browsers cache hard ... and your web server will tell them toaswell
[02:00:44] <NodeX> to aswell *
[02:01:09] <NodeX> thanks blackspotwiggins : I only just logged into BNC so didn't see the original question :)
[02:01:13] <jiduvah> NodeX: sorry what do you mean by cache hard?
[02:01:18] <Ricoshady> ok, NodeX, you have a cookie loggedIn, its true or false (no it doesnt auth on the backend), whats the best way to display a login|logout link to the user dynamically
[02:01:29] <aaronmcadam> expires headers should be set on your server
[02:01:50] <NodeX> err with your serverside lol
[02:01:57] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:02:07] <Ricoshady> NodeX, that is what I want to avoid
[02:02:10] <aaronmcadam> NodeX++
[02:02:12] <Spadeski> #css
[02:02:13] <NodeX> buyt why
[02:02:24] <Ricoshady> because backend hits are expensive
[02:02:26] <aaronmcadam> you want to avoid doing it the right way?
[02:02:28] <NodeX> no lookups ... your php (if you use it) would be 1 line
[02:02:28] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[02:02:40] <aaronmcadam> is it a page reload Ricoshady
[02:02:46] <aaronmcadam> or are you using ajax for everything
[02:03:04] <aaronmcadam> that's true
[02:03:13] <aaronmcadam> all it does is check the session, no db hits
[02:03:13] <Spadeski> hey i got this jqplayer that doesnt wanan work can someone check itou t?
[02:03:22] <NodeX> if you must do it in JS then .... wait for the page to render with $(document).ready(); then check the cookie with javascript and $("#your-dom-node").html("Logged in")
[02:03:25] <Ricoshady> i dont want to hit apache at all
[02:03:28] <aaronmcadam> overhead would be almost non existant
[02:03:38] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, didnt you read? "tons of server gain"
[02:03:48] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[02:03:52] <blackspotwiggins> TONS
[02:03:54] <blackspotwiggins> OF
[02:03:55] <blackspotwiggins> GAIN
[02:03:56] <aaronmcadam> tf?
[02:04:20] <NodeX> Ricoshady : unless you are running a very very poor httpd on a calculator I think it can handle it
[02:04:20] <filename> does .ajax/.get/.post even works in IE 8?
[02:04:20] <aaronmcadam> what you on about, tons of server gain for something that doesn't need to be ajax
[02:04:36] <Ricoshady> have you guys used varnish before?
[02:04:36] <NodeX> filename : of course it does
[02:04:41] <NodeX> I have many times
[02:04:54] <filename> NodeX i have error: you're offline (status 0)
[02:05:02] <filename> in IE 8 when i try to $.get page
[02:05:06] <filename> in mozilla/chrome it works
[02:05:07] <NodeX> turn your browser online then lol
[02:05:19] <NodeX> it's in "file" -> work online or something
[02:05:20] <filename> NodeX any good answer?
[02:05:28] <Ricoshady> well you can save a lot of backend hits, and spread that cache over several varnish server, and use only 1 or 2 www servers
[02:05:45] <NodeX> varnish can read and write cookies iirc
[02:05:50] <Ricoshady> at a certain level even straight calls to the session get expensive
[02:05:57] <Ricoshady> i know it can
[02:06:09] <cwl> Nodex: http://jsfiddle.net/YVqAA/9/     eventhough, the image isn't linked directly, it still knows to link it with the url, but it only uses first one.
[02:06:10] <NodeX> and iirc it can (with lua) inject into the page
[02:06:20] <aaronmcadam> seriously,  a simple login shouldn't be expensive
[02:06:40] <Ricoshady> expensive is realitive to the number of requets
[02:06:48] <aaronmcadam> how many
[02:07:02] <Ricoshady> 1000+/s
[02:07:31] <Ricoshady> with much more expensive calls coming in too
[02:07:33] <NodeX> my moderate 16gb ram web servers can handle 2900 req/s without even breaking a sweat lol
[02:07:45] <aaronmcadam> yeah seriously that's low
[02:07:46] <Ricoshady> yea, if EVERY call was only that
[02:08:01] <filename> where i can read about status codes that .get .ajax returns ?
[02:08:11] <aaronmcadam> must be something wrong with ur load balancers if u have to worry about that
[02:08:14] <NodeX> 2900 req/s running a full CMS ... which is alot more than that !
[02:08:19] <filename> i setuped it through .ajaxSetup
[02:08:26] <NodeX> filename : did you fix it
[02:08:41] <filename> NodeX the problem is not with this, i am online and checkbox is unchecked

[02:09:00] <NodeX> cwl : why do you even need javascript for this
[02:09:26] <aaronmcadam> because ajax can do everything!
[02:09:27] <aaronmcadam> :D
[02:09:31] <NodeX> it wont degrade if you attach a click to the <img />
[02:09:48] <NodeX> and it's bad for SEO to have an empty anchor
[02:09:51] <Ricoshady> aaronmcadam, not even using ajax
[02:10:02] <aaronmcadam> i was being sarcastic...

[02:10:17] <filename> aaronmcadam thx: http://jsfiddle.net/dqcWY/
[02:10:37] <Ricoshady> NodeX, theme are merely login/lougout links
[02:10:43] <NodeX> Ricoshady : I really wouldn't worry about it.... the memory and footprint of a quick cookie check in php if nothing
[02:10:44] <Ricoshady> these
[02:10:48] <filename> it works in mozilla/chrome but not in IE 8, i got 'you're offline'
[02:10:49] <aaronmcadam> syntax errors filename

[02:11:19] <aaronmcadam> u need html in there too you know
[02:11:26] <filename> ah ok
[02:11:27] <Ricoshady> varnish is blazing fast compared to apache

[02:12:55] <filename> the code is inside html inside $(function() {...
[02:13:02] <NodeX> besides an <a> can't wrap a DIV .. it's invalid markup

[02:13:07] <aaronmcadam> hahahah
[02:13:09] <aaronmcadam> christ
[02:13:12] <aaronmcadam> read that article
[02:13:27] <aaronmcadam> I'm not teaching u jsfiddle too lol
[02:13:29] <NodeX> [10:11:27] <Ricoshady> varnish is blazing fast compared to apache
[02:13:31] <Cork> NodeX: in html4 ya, but... not in html5
[02:13:37] <wgo> I'm looking for help with a real simple regex. I want to match for instance $('h3').html() contains the word unsaved.
[02:13:58] <NodeX> Varnish is a caching engine not a web server so it's not fair to compare... apache does suck though :)
[02:13:58] <aaronmcadam> ?contains @ wgo
[02:13:59] <bot-t> wgo, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[02:14:00] <Cork> NodeX: got that shocking news my self a few weeks ago :/
[02:14:09] <filename> aaronmcadam did u mean i pasted something wrong?
[02:14:25] <wgo> oh excellent aaronmcadam thank you.
[02:14:25] <NodeX> yeh but even in html5 why not render in html rather than making jquery put it right
[02:14:46] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:14:57] <Cork> NodeX: no i meant <a><div></div></a> is valid in html5
[02:14:57] <aaronmcadam> jquery is a hammer that's used as a sledge
[02:15:08] <Ricoshady> so if I do an inline <script> .append it seems to achieve the same thing
[02:16:11] <aaronmcadam> what are u actually trying to do
[02:16:24] <filename> aaronmcadam i can be in error thinking that status code 0 is mean 'offline', where i can read about ajax return status codes?
[02:16:30] <NodeX> Yer I got that bit Cork ... but the guy has <div><a></a><img /></div> and want's jquery to have the page goto the URL in <a> when the img is clicked
[02:16:42] <aaronmcadam> filename there's a little known website called google
[02:16:51] <filename> aaronmcadam i did not found any resource

[02:17:34] <filename> aaronmcadam no, i mean status codes that jquery $.get can return
[02:17:44] <aaronmcadam> get returns those
[02:17:48] <NodeX> it returns what the webserver returns
[02:17:52] <aaronmcadam> anyway why are you doing it that way
[02:17:58] <filename> what for is made .ajaxSetup?
[02:18:02] <aaronmcadam> or are u just experimenting

[02:20:33] <filename> ok sorry but you're all was wrong i am asking not for http codes

[02:22:56] <aaronmcadam> some error code
[02:23:00] <aaronmcadam> whatever
[02:23:08] <aaronmcadam> let's give up NodeX
[02:23:16] <filename> i got code 0 - is that http status code NodeX?
[02:23:21] <filename> i think not
[02:23:32] <NodeX> it's an abort signal from the server
[02:23:40] <NodeX> which triggers the browsers default code which i
[02:23:43] <NodeX> is 0
[02:23:47] <NodeX> so I think so
[02:24:29] <aaronmcadam> are u even using firebug
[02:24:33] <filename> yes
[02:24:35] <aaronmcadam> read that site on how to debug
[02:24:40] <blackspotwiggins> ie doesnt have firebug..
[02:24:47] <filename> aaronmcadam what is this the site with kid on the center and nothinh else?
[02:25:04] <aaronmcadam> use keyboard
[02:25:04] <filename> even in chrome
[02:25:05] <filename> wow
[02:25:08] <aaronmcadam> firebug lite blackspotwiggins
[02:25:18] <blackspotwiggins> that's rather crappy
[02:25:23] <aaronmcadam> better than nothin
[02:25:30] <NodeX> ie9 kinda has some dev tools
[02:25:34] <aaronmcadam> he's obviously doing somethin wrong
[02:25:38] <NodeX> they are similare to the Chrome ones
[02:25:44] <NodeX> but not as good...
[02:26:13] <aaronmcadam> typically :)
[02:26:32] <filename> well thanks aaronmcadam i know basics of debugging because i am writing windows device drivers and freebsd kernel modules
[02:26:40] <filename> but this is not a real guide
[02:26:45] <NodeX> congrats
[02:26:55] <filename> so the quick answer is to view uncompressed jquery i think...
[02:27:13] <NodeX> ok for the 5th time response ==0 is NOT A JQUERY RESPONSE
[02:27:26] <NodeX> but go waste your time in the source :)
[02:27:42] <NodeX> Ignored
[02:27:55] * NodeX hopes it hasn't been put in the latest source lol
[02:28:16] <filename> can this error hapen because i am calling .get inside .click() ?
[02:29:32] <aaronmcadam> jquery just returns what the server sends it
[02:29:49] <aaronmcadam> it's nothing specific to jquery, hence the docs don't document them u "idiot"
[02:30:03] <aaronmcadam> NodeX, filename: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/
[02:30:13] <NodeX> more the browser returns what the sevrer sends it and abort() == 0
[02:30:19] <filename> aaronmcadam its better to place this in docs rather than answering 'go to FILe->uncheck offline mode'
[02:30:35] <aaronmcadam> how can a lib allow for user stupidity?
[02:30:39] <NodeX> nice tool -> added to bookmarks
[02:30:41] <filename> in my case i think jquery even can't initiate ajax object
[02:30:47] <logitec> Hello, does anybody have experience using framesets and frame redirects? I want to change my content-frame when the user clicks on a <a href> in the menu-frame
[02:32:20] <Cork> logitec: just set target to the frame you want to update
[02:33:01] <logitec> I'm sorry to say I don't know how to use targets, I am totally new to JQuery
[02:33:20] <Cork> logitec: why use jquery at all?
[02:33:26] <Cork> just set target on the a tag
[02:33:30] <NodeX> yer lol
[02:33:40] <Cork> <a href="url to enter" target="content">click me</a>
[02:33:42] <logitec> should I create an onClick to a function, then inside the function change the target
[02:33:58] <logitec> Really? so easy?
[02:34:02] <logitec> No need for JQuery?
[02:34:03] <Cork> yes
[02:34:11] <Cork> frameset outdates most of js so XD
[02:34:13] <NodeX> rule #1 ... don't use onClick!
[02:34:31] <NodeX> rule #2 .... don't use JS when you dont gotta
[02:34:39] <Cork> if you would have needed js to make it work it would have been dead in the water
[02:35:14] <NodeX> I didn't know anyone use frames anymore
[02:35:32] <Cork> most don't
[02:36:00] <filename> bot owners use
[02:36:00] <logitec> Somebody advised me to use it to prevent the navigation-frame from reloading every time a redirect occurs
[02:36:02] <Cork> cause it sucks when you want to use thinks like text_to_speach or mobile devices
[02:36:06] <NodeX> I use Iframes for uploads and that's about it
[02:36:10] <logitec> to keep the navigation-frame static
[02:36:22] <logitec> Are there any better solutions for that?
[02:36:26] <NodeX> logitec : you can use Ajax for that nowerdays
[02:36:29] <Cork> logitec: position fixed! :)
[02:36:31] <NodeX> and it degrades
[02:36:43] <Cork> no need to frames
[02:36:48] <Cork> *for
[02:37:03] <NodeX> I think he meant a round trip Cork
[02:37:15] <Cork> ah
[02:37:19] <NodeX> like load the content without the whole page reloading
[02:37:28] <logitec> exactly like NodeX said
[02:37:45] <NodeX> logitec : I would look at doing it with AJax
[02:37:56] <NodeX> it's probably 5 lines of javascript
[02:38:08] <Cork> one of jquery :)
[02:38:15] <NodeX> ^^ jquery*
[02:38:25] <NodeX> 1 if you remove \n lol
[02:39:06] <Cork> $('a[href="/"]').live(function() { $('#content').load(this.href); });
[02:39:38] * NodeX indents for his sanity
[02:39:56] <Cork> would still not be more then 3 ;)
[02:40:23] <NodeX> document.ready ? :P
[02:40:32] <NodeX> and clicking the first one on load :P
[02:40:34] <NodeX> == 6
[02:40:48] <Cork> why click the first one on load?
[02:41:03] <logitec> I don't understand most of that line of code
[02:41:04] <Cork> on ready i buy but not click
[02:41:17] <NodeX> his SS might not have loaded it or... perhaps a hashbang to load one
[02:41:18] <logitec> what does the .live part do?
[02:41:40] <NodeX> means any <a> with a href now or in the future bind a click to
[02:41:41] <Cork> logitec: bind all elenents of the selector for the duration of the page
[02:42:19] <Cork> though i missed event.preventDefault();
[02:42:31] <NodeX> oh dear lol me too
[02:42:34] <logitec> so every line with a <a href> has this functionality added?
[02:42:44] <NodeX> logitec yes
[02:42:46] <Cork> $(fucntion() {$('a[href="/"]').live(function(event) { event.prefentDefault(); $('#content').load(this.href); }); });
[02:42:48] <NodeX> on that page at least
[02:42:48] <Cork> there :)
[02:43:00] <dannN> Hi, is this an good solution when i'm using jQuery and MooTools together? http://pastebin.com/Pp5drBYQ --- Or is there an better solution?
[02:43:07] <Cork> ugg typo...
[02:43:08] <logitec> okay! so what about the preventdefault, what does that do?
[02:43:23] <filename> like preventchildrens
[02:43:23] <NodeX> prevents the browser from follwoing the lnk when a user clicks it
[02:43:28] <NodeX> link *
[02:43:29] <Cork> logitec: it stops the default action, it wold reload the page
[02:43:50] <logitec> ah i see
[02:44:08] <Cork> logitec: this way you could do a simple check for ajax header on the sever side, and only send the content part
[02:44:21] <Cork> logitec: and if they don't have js on, send the complete page
[02:44:36] <logitec> thats neat
[02:45:57] <Cork> and with the new push state you could event make it behave like if it really did reload the page :)
[02:46:00] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries
[02:46:17] <Cork> event==even
[02:46:43] <logitec> interesting
[02:47:06] <Cork> not all browsers support it though
[02:47:52] <aaronmcadam> history.js gets used a lot now
[02:48:19] <Cork> it can't really do everything push state does though
[02:48:31] <logitec> now comes the reason why i didn't use js/jquery so often
[02:48:44] <logitec> i implemented the function and its not working, how to debug this problem properly?
[02:48:52] <logitec> i always get lost at this part

[02:54:30] <dannN> Hi, why does this don't work: http://pastebin.com/kVhphwJP
[02:54:51] <Ricoshady> wow, thanks everyone... in a around about way you all helped a lot, even blackspotwiggins in the end
[02:55:00] <Ricoshady> using all the tidbits, figured it out
[02:55:10] <antoine[taf]> that's ok, no pb
[02:55:14] <NodeX> dannN : noConflict();
[02:55:17] <Ricoshady> dont need document.write(), get the same thing done, and fixed the error, and I dont hit apache
[02:55:38] <NodeX> ?noConflict | dannN
[02:55:39] <bot-t> NodeX, jQuery.noConflict() - Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[02:55:58] <dannN> http://pastebin.com/izTVLWyx also doesn't work
[02:56:25] <NodeX> jQuery("#wrapper").hide();
[02:56:34] <Ricoshady> so anyway, thanks for your help
[02:56:36] <Ricoshady> all of you
[02:56:38] <dannN> but i want to use $ for jQuery
[02:56:38] <inad922> hello
[02:56:44] <NodeX> why even bother with mootools if you are using jquery
[02:56:58] <dannN> because the extensions of cms are using mootools
[02:56:58] <NodeX> nps Ricoshady : good luck
[02:57:08] <NodeX> joomla ? :(
[02:57:32] <dannN> i want to use $ for jquery. it's no problem if i have to use $ within an noConflict tag, but it doesn't work
[02:57:43] <inad922> If I add a click function to an 'a' tag with some custom stuff how can I prevent reloading the page and scrolling away from current position. Setting href to "" disables scrolling away but then it reloads the page.
[02:57:49] <NodeX> simple answer is you can't, you can however do $jq=jQuery.noConflict();
[02:57:56] <Kambfhase> dannN: http://pastebin.com/45zYR289
[02:57:59] <NodeX> and $jq is now $
[02:58:44] <NodeX> inad922 : event.preventDefault();
[02:59:22] <NodeX> inad922 : $('a.foo').click(function(event){event.preventDefault()....rest of code});
[02:59:35] <inad922> Thanks NodeX.
[02:59:38] <mrskman> inad922: return false;
[02:59:44] <NodeX> :)
[02:59:54] <inad922> return false is necessary?
[02:59:58] <NodeX> no
[02:59:59] <inad922> I mean what is that for?
[03:00:03] <NodeX> use preventDefault()
[03:00:19] <NodeX> return false will return you out of your function
[03:00:33] <NodeX> preventDefault() allows you to continu working
[03:00:56] <dannN> Kambfhase: Thank you, it works.
[03:01:03] <Kambfhase> :)
[03:01:32] <inad922> I see.
[03:01:38] <inad922> Thanks again. :)
[03:01:44] <NodeX> ;)
[03:03:13] <dannN> Kambfhase: Must jQuery.noConflict(); be on the end of document?
[03:03:29] <Kambfhase> no.
[03:04:07] <dannN> ok, i see, its only important that its declared
[03:04:39] <Kambfhase> infact it should be called early
[03:05:00] <dannN> yes, i call it after i include the jquery library, is this correct?
[03:05:12] <aaronmcadam> yes
[03:06:44] <NodeX> I guess all teh Apple owners are at Job' funeral

[03:08:53] <aaronmcadam> is Gordon making any progress anyway

[03:09:21] <aaronmcadam> #jqueryui no longer exists

[03:09:30] <aaronmcadam> #jquery is the place for jq and jq ui NodeX
[03:09:34] <NodeX> lemme go and start it lol
[03:09:44] <dannN> thanks for help guys
[03:09:58] <aaronmcadam> zen_: that's really easy, the docs explain that
[03:10:06] <zen_> i read them
[03:10:15] <zen_> they only say about click on a text box
[03:10:20] <zen_> not on a link
[03:10:21] <aaronmcadam> no
[03:10:27] <aaronmcadam> there's a way to programmatically call it
[03:10:40] <zen_> i tried giving link id as $('#linkID').datepicker();
[03:10:44] <aaronmcadam> just call it from the click callback
[03:10:44] <zen_> but nothing happened
[03:11:49] <aaronmcadam> $( button ).click( func.. {  $('#inputID').datepicker(); });
[03:11:53] <NodeX> I can see a quick way... using buttonImage/buttonText but it's a hack ...
[03:12:06] <NodeX> or that ^^
[03:12:22] <aaronmcadam> it probably needs to attach to an input so just do that, it's simple!
[03:12:57] <NodeX> I like ui but I find it terribly bloated
[03:13:25] <paulanthony> everyone i'm having a problem with jquery ui on the ipad, using sliders. i have 2 sliders, and if i slide one, the other doesn't slide. unless i fiddle about, by clicking on something else. how might i resolve this?

[03:24:54] <nVee> hey guys, im not too sure how to achieve this. Is there a way to disable a button until someone has scrolled to the bottom of a overflow: scroll div?
[03:25:00] <nVee> obviously used for terms and conditions :P
[03:26:26] <NodeX> you can bind to a scroll and then once at bottom (offset) change the property of the button
[03:26:40] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, that's only annoying and doesnt help much :)
[03:26:46] <blackspotwiggins> but yea like NodeX said
[03:27:11] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/ <-- you can adapt that example to do what you need

[03:32:07] <inad922> anyone knows how can I enable the google button to promote web pages in a search result for myself so when I search again with the same words it will be the first hit for me Button can be seen on this page http://www.seohosting.com/blog/search-engine-news/google-promote-button-and-seo/
[03:32:44] <blackspotwiggins> wgo, you need beforeunload i think
[03:33:28] <wgo> blackspotwiggins, ok. I have one other issue that I don't want this to happen if it is the save button that is clicked causing the page to be left.
[03:33:44] <logitec> Alright, back from lunch and debugging jquery
[03:33:55] <logitec> it says 'has no method split', any idea's?
[03:34:26] <blackspotwiggins> wgo, well you can control if/when the event gets bound
[03:34:39] <wgo> ok yes - I see
[03:34:39] <luxigo> logitec: then it is not a string
[03:35:03] <logitec> thats right, its a function?
[03:35:42] <luxigo> no, i mean you try to use method .split() on something else
[03:36:28] <luxigo> eg undefined
[03:40:18] <n__> Hi
[03:43:06] <poppiez> I'm building a build script where I concatenate and minify all my JS files for each page. I want to put a copyright notice in my code at the top, however, jquery is the first file that is included with its unminified copyright notice. is this OK or does it have to come after the jquery copyright notice?
[03:43:36] <antoine[taf]> well, just pretend you coded jquery
[03:44:31] <poppiez> I'm not. I just said the jquery copyright notice is intact. I'm just asking about placement of my copyright notice. I'm using a bunch of other libs each with their own copyright notices
[03:44:44] <blackspotwiggins> doesnt really matter where it is
[03:45:07] <antoine[taf]> 'twas a joke =/
[03:45:29] <poppiez> antoine[taf]: didn't get it... good one tho ;)
[03:45:30] <poppiez> hehe
[03:45:41] <poppiez> blackspotwiggins: alright, great
[03:45:44] <antoine[taf]> I would agree with blackspotwiggins

[03:51:22] <antoine[taf]> I can design your internet page too, if you will
[03:51:59] <aaronmcadam> poppiez: should u not concatenate all your dependencies first and then your own code?
[03:53:13] <Merbster> I am trying to change the background of a textarea. I hit the code (I have debugged it)  - I have tested the code, isolated on jsfiddle.net (and it works there) - but when I implement it where I actually need it, nothing happens when the code is hit (i.e. the textarea does not change background color) - what are the typical reasons for this?
[03:53:29] <poppiez> aaronmcadam: well, I think it depends on what you want to do. I only want one JS file per page
[03:53:45] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[03:53:57] <aaronmcadam> can u not put ur copyright notice at the top of the first file of ur own code
[03:54:34] <poppiez> aaronmcadam: well, I could do that
[03:55:01] <poppiez> aaronmcadam: that is, if you think the other way isn't the way to go. easier that way :)
[03:55:17] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[03:55:34] <aaronmcadam> well maybe, at the very top, you could say "unless otherwise licensed all other code is mine"
[03:55:47] <poppiez> good idea

[03:58:49] <aaronmcadam> ?doesn't work
[03:58:49] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[03:59:30] <aaronmcadam> explaining what u want rather than "page isn't showing"
[04:01:42] <Merbster> nail_ I am developing for our intranet, so I can't even post you a link. - I can tell you that trying to change the background color in the JS debugger in IE. doesn't even work. But it outputs a list of the elements I'd expect it to affect.
[04:01:58] <Merbster> nail_, outputs the list in the console
[04:02:02] <JillesCode> Ehrm, http://pastebin.com/Adg1GMp7 its outputting nothing but a blank page and there is no error.
[04:02:29] <aaronmcadam> fiddle it

[04:03:32] <JillesCode> oke okieok
[04:03:43] <Merbster> nail_ yes exactly, I would not be so puzzled if the line was not hit.

[04:05:55] <bot-t> Stop talking to me that way, I'm a lady, goddamnit!
[04:09:06] <nail_> Merbster: ok, then unless you can reproduce that in a fiddle, I've no idea :/
[04:09:36] <Merbster> nail_, another weird thing; $('.wikiedit').attr("readonly") === undefined returns false - yet when I alert the same selector (incklding the attr()) it gives me undefined in the popup
[04:10:15] <Merbster> nail_, I will experiment some more. Thank you for your feedback - much appreciated
[04:11:04] <Kambfhase> Merbster: undefined !== "undefined"
[04:11:21] <Merbster> Kambfhase, I checked both string and the actual undefined
[04:11:26] <Kambfhase> hmm
[04:11:52] <Merbster> Kambfhase, thanks though :)
[04:11:58] <Kambfhase> did something overwrite your undefined?
[04:12:06] <aaronmcadam> u don't do it that way Merbster
[04:12:13] <dgx> Why is this failiing to remov the div?: http://pastie.org/2649027. It works on the first click, but doesn't work on the second(with .remove() ).
[04:12:23] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, don't do what, which way?
[04:12:43] <aaronmcadam> !$('.wikiedit').attr("readonly") && doSomethingIfNotReadOnly
[04:13:25] <aaronmcadam> or $('.wikiedit').attr("readonly") || doSomethingIfNotReadOnly()
[04:13:39] <Kambfhase> dgx: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[04:13:57] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ dgx
[04:13:57] <bot-t> dgx, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:14:22] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, my code works  - atleast with the checking of readonly it's the background-color change that doesn't work
[04:14:24] <nail_> dgx: and what's in "if (s==1) { ... }" will never be executed if that's your actual code
[04:14:42] <antihero> Hey, I know there's a "scroll" event, is there a "stopped scrolling" event?
[04:14:46] <dgx> I see. Reading that now, tnx
[04:14:48] <aaronmcadam> I'm not saying it's wrong Merbster, i meant you don't need to check undefined
[04:15:05] <antihero> Basically I want something faded in whilst scrolling, and out when someone stops scrolling
[04:15:14] <nail_> dgx: and "1" will work but is not a valid id
[04:15:31] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, Your way is cleaner I can see that. but I am too lazy to change it all right now ;)
[04:15:36] <Merbster> (since that part works)
[04:16:07] <aaronmcadam> I'm saying u don't need the == undefined because if ( bla ) will return a boolean anyway
[04:16:13] <dgx> Nail_: what do you mean by  valid id? Are you talknig about the 's' var?
[04:16:27] <aaronmcadam> of if ( !bla ) returns false if undefined
[04:16:35] <aaronmcadam> of if ( !bla ) returns true if undefined
[04:16:43] <aaronmcadam> sorry hehe
[04:17:55] <nail_> dgx: no, your id="1"
[04:18:04] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I figured as much - but I am still not totally up to date with how js/jquery typecasts. So I jsut made it explicit to be certain.
[04:18:19] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, but you are right ^^ and thank you for the suggestion
[04:18:22] <aaronmcadam> type coercion :)
[04:19:00] <aaronmcadam> does an attr call return undefined for u then?
[04:19:22] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, on the readonly it does. - readonly on the HTML element is a bit weird too.
[04:19:32] <dgx> nail_: It is valid and worknig actually, it is the  first <option> element. The second part doesn't work.
[04:20:18] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, point is- the readonly html attribute is there or not- you cannot set it to true or false 1 or 0 - you just add it or remove it to set the textarea element in the mode you want (which is weird I think compared to how all other attributes work)
[04:20:19] <aaronmcadam> it's not valid
[04:20:25] <aaronmcadam> it does work, but not valid dgx
[04:20:35] <aaronmcadam> yes
[04:20:49] <aaronmcadam> there may be no readonly="readonly"
[04:21:03] <aaronmcadam> there is no false that'd make no sense
[04:21:35] <aaronmcadam> so what u might want is if ( el.has([readonly]) )
[04:21:48] <nail_> dgx: id and name attributes can't start with a digit (even if that "works"), and what's in your "if (s==1) { ... }" will never be executed, since s === 0 at that moment
[04:22:00] <aaronmcadam> ah scratch that
[04:22:04] <aaronmcadam> has is only for children
[04:22:32] <dgx> So id/name can't start with digit?
[04:22:34] <aaronmcadam> nail_, dgx, also his id would be a string, not a number
[04:22:50] <nail_> dgx: see http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html :)
[04:22:56] <aaronmcadam> need parseInt() or the + unary operator
[04:22:59] <nail_> ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[04:23:30] <aaronmcadam> js will still check the value nail_
[04:23:43] <aaronmcadam> whether it's valid just applies to html
[04:23:57] <aaronmcadam> the reason his code is breaking is cuz he's saying does it equal to the number 1
[04:24:05] <aaronmcadam> when he needs to parse the string to a number
[04:24:13] <nail_> aaronmcadam: yes I know, I'm just pointing that out for the sake of cleanliness :)
[04:24:15] <aaronmcadam> with +s or parseInt( s )
[04:25:07] <nail_> aaronmcadam: no, s is set to 1 in the callback, so when it hits the "if" it's still 0, so int or not it won't work :)
[04:25:19] <aaronmcadam> ah k
[04:25:36] <aaronmcadam> i haven't looked at this code anyway hah
[04:26:23] <dgx> So the two mistakes were id/name starting with digit and the use of AJAX/events?
[04:26:32] <Merbster> is it possible to add an inline style to an element with the attr() method?
[05:03:04] <poppiez> I'm using ICanHaz.js, which is great. however, when it comes to giving the text/html script tags ids I'm a bit lost. e.g. I'm writing a book reader with id#book. what should the script id be? is it ok to name it id#book as well since ICanHaz.js removes the script tag? I hope you know what I mean
[05:03:30] <poppiez> I can then look it up by doing ich.book
[05:06:00] <NodeX> what is "ICanHaz" ? is it a jquery plugin ?
[05:07:09] <poppiez> NodeX: I'm built in top of jquery or zepto
[05:07:12] <aaronmcadam> it's like yepnope
[05:07:18] <poppiez> on top*
[05:07:31] <poppiez> aaronmcadam: nah, it's a templating system
[05:07:34] <NodeX> never heard of any of that lol
[05:07:35] <aaronmcadam> ahh cool
[05:07:43] <aaronmcadam> ?yepnope
[05:07:43] <bot-t> yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[05:08:07] <jeffsmykil> Is it possible to compare a url to a value in jquery?
[05:08:20] <aaronmcadam> what url?
[05:08:32] <aaronmcadam> what are you trying to do jeffsmykil
[05:08:53] <jeffsmykil> asp has this tab interrface where the end of the url is tab=nameoftab
[05:09:12] <aaronmcadam> you mean bla.asp?tab=nameoftab?
[05:09:17] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[05:09:23] <aaronmcadam> and you want "nameoftab"
[05:09:28] <antihero> Is there a way I can have a floating bar at the top of the page quite simply?
[05:09:37] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: correct sir
[05:09:38] <aaronmcadam> ?bbq @ jeffsmykil
[05:09:39] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[05:10:02] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: $.deparam.queryString() will return you an object like this: { tab : "nameoftab" }
[05:10:04] <jeffsmykil> hrm, plugin was hoping there was a function
[05:10:11] <aaronmcadam> it's only 4 k
[05:10:11] <jeffsmykil> built in
[05:10:17] <hokapoka> Is there anything in the core of jquery that will submit a form via XHR?
[05:10:21] <jeffsmykil> yeah its complicated :/
[05:10:25] <aaronmcadam> lol what?
[05:10:30] <aaronmcadam> that's simple as it gets
[05:10:42] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: long story short I can
[05:10:47] <jeffsmykil> I can't use plugins
[05:10:51] <aaronmcadam> right...
[05:11:01] <aaronmcadam> well document.location.search will return the chunk
[05:11:03] <jeffsmykil> not my decision, not my choice
[05:11:08] <aaronmcadam> then deserialize it yourself
[05:11:17] <aaronmcadam> "?tab=nameoftab"
[05:11:17] <jeffsmykil> mm deserialization
[05:12:24] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: so I can get the url and then splice it at a certain point?
[05:12:35] <aaronmcadam> read what i said
[05:12:40] <hokapoka> It's easy enough for me to write a script that passed a form reference and submits it, just thought there might have been something in the core lib like $(formRef).ajaxSubmit();
[05:12:42] <aaronmcadam> document.location.search will return "?tab=ldflds"
[05:13:07] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/JavaScript/0320__Location/Locationsearch.htm
[05:13:21] <aaronmcadam> uh why are u sendin me that haah
[05:13:32] <jeffsmykil> that's what I need to do?
[05:13:38] <aaronmcadam> it's easy
[05:13:47] <jeffsmykil> sorry never done it before
[05:13:54] <aaronmcadam> but i use $.deparam to deserialize it easily
[05:14:15] <jeffsmykil> wont document.location.search return the whole url?
[05:14:18] <aaronmcadam> lol
[05:14:26] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ jeffsmykil
[05:14:37] <aaronmcadam> ?bot
[05:15:09] <jeffsmykil> oh im starting to figure it out
[05:15:11] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[05:15:26] <aaronmcadam> try it and see
[05:15:33] <jeffsmykil> yeah i did a console.log
[05:15:37] <aaronmcadam> cool
[05:15:37] <jeffsmykil> nwo i see what it returns
[05:15:40] <aaronmcadam> yip
[05:15:49] <jeffsmykil> ty
[05:15:51] <hokapoka> jeffsmykil: use the console, it your friend when you what to find stuff like that out,
[05:16:02] <aaronmcadam> then you can split it
[05:16:05] <aaronmcadam> on the ?
[05:16:10] <Kambfhase> cool guys use alert
[05:16:12] <aaronmcadam> or "?tab="
[05:16:15] <NodeX> my Girlfriend cracks me up .. I ask her nicely if she want's to watch a film tonight to which she shouts ... "NO I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH LORD OF THE F****** RINGS"
[05:16:30] <aaronmcadam> document.location.search.split('?tab') jeffsmykil console.log that
[05:19:06] <jeffsmykil> NodeX maybe you could watch Ameliea together or whatever the fuck it's called
[05:19:20] <jeffsmykil> and you could bang your head against the wall
[05:19:37] <NodeX> or I could shoot myself in the face lol
[05:19:46] <jeffsmykil> also effective
[05:19:55] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil:
[05:20:10] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: var tabName = document.location.search.split('?tab=')[1]
[05:20:24] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[05:20:37] <aaronmcadam> u already got it
[05:20:44] <jeffsmykil> i just talked to the engineer, apparently asp has a built in way he wants to use instead of doing it client side
[05:20:54] <aaronmcadam> good
[05:21:10] <aaronmcadam> least u know now haha
[05:21:22] <jeffsmykil> yeah im sure ill use it again
[05:21:59] <aaronmcadam> right i'm off to do some work. need a build script, jasmine testing and upgrade my jqm project to rc1
[05:22:07] <jeffsmykil> not silk?
[05:22:09] <jeffsmykil> jasmine?
[05:22:38] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: http://tinnedfruit.com/2011/03/03/testing-backbone-apps-with-jasmine-sinon.html
[05:22:46] <aaronmcadam> i need to read that
[05:23:11] <jeffsmykil> that looks a lot like QA stuff
[05:23:13] <aaronmcadam> my project is jqm and bbone
[05:23:27] <aaronmcadam> course it is yeh
[05:23:37] <jeffsmykil> they have people for that!
[05:23:44] <aaronmcadam> no they don't
[05:23:45] <aaronmcadam> haha
[05:23:58] <aaronmcadam> how many of your asp testers know how to test js properly? ;)
[05:24:05] <aaronmcadam> willing to bet they hate js
[05:24:15] <jeffsmykil> everyone but here hates js
[05:24:20] <jeffsmykil> that's why i do it
[05:24:30] <aaronmcadam> idiots :)
[05:24:48] <jeffsmykil> they just don't like the lack of debugging and stuff
[05:24:56] <jeffsmykil> I dont know any better
[05:24:58] <aaronmcadam> that's bullshit
[05:25:12] <aaronmcadam> they're just overly dependant on visual studio
[05:25:39] <aaronmcadam> cloud9 has awesome code inspection
[05:25:46] <aaronmcadam> intelli-j is ok too
[05:25:56] <jeffsmykil> i hate visual studio as it doesn't code fold javascript
[05:27:35] <aaronmcadam> try cloud9 for a few mins
[05:27:44] <jeffsmykil> not an opensource project
[05:27:45] <aaronmcadam> I don't use it extensively myself but it's awesome
[05:27:54] <aaronmcadam> it's free u can run it locally
[05:27:55] <jeffsmykil> no way they are going to pay for another ide
[05:28:08] <aaronmcadam> the payment model is based on cloud hosting ur code jeff
[05:28:12] <jeffsmykil> ah
[05:28:15] <jeffsmykil> i didn't realize that
[05:28:18] <aaronmcadam> yep
[05:28:22] <aaronmcadam> u can run it on node locally
[05:28:30] <aaronmcadam> it *is* open source
[05:28:41] <aaronmcadam> just cuz u pay for something doesn't mean it's not open source
[05:29:13] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9
[05:29:53] <jeffsmykil> i will look into that
[05:29:57] <jeffsmykil> when i have a bit more time
[05:29:58] <jeffsmykil> ty
[05:30:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah lemme guess, you're not allowed to install node either ;)
[05:30:15] <jeffsmykil> don't know
[05:30:18] <jeffsmykil> first i have heard of it
[05:30:23] <aaronmcadam> you're running windows?
[05:30:29] <aaronmcadam> node.js?
[05:30:39] <aaronmcadam> you've never heard of that?
[05:30:43] <jeffsmykil> 7 and OS X.7 and Ubuntu in VMs
[05:30:45] <jeffsmykil> Ive heard of it
[05:30:51] <jeffsmykil> just am ignorant
[05:30:56] <aaronmcadam> ok? haha
[05:31:36] <aaronmcadam> do ur QA team unit test js then?
[05:32:17] <jeffsmykil> <_<  >_>
[05:33:48] <aaronmcadam> haha
[05:33:49] <jeffsmykil> dont know
[05:34:00] <aaronmcadam> ah i'd never like to work in a company of ur size
[05:34:19] <jeffsmykil> lol this is a startup
[05:34:24] <jeffsmykil> we have a qa engineer
[05:34:34] <jeffsmykil> im not sure what he does though for testing
[05:35:34] <johnline3> $("#aotmpost ul.photos li:first").find('75sq').replace('400');
[05:35:34] <johnline3> <img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr5hl5k1Ga1r2kr9xo1_75sq.jpg"/>
[05:35:35] <gsommer> Has anyone ever gotten the tablesort plugin to work with shortdates? (dd/mm/yyy). I've tried what the documentation says - but I cannot get it to sort correctly. Did I miss something here?  Sample-code: http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.html
[05:35:40] <johnline3> how i make this werk
[05:37:04] <Cork> johnline3: var $photo = $("#aotmpost ul.photos li:first"); $photo.attr('src', $photo.attr('src').replace('75sq, '400'));
[05:37:07] <hokapoka> Is there a way to use a regexp in an attribute value selector?
[05:37:11] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: apparently i need to look into unit testing js lol
[05:37:22] <Cork> hokapoka: no just ^ and $
[05:37:27] <hokapoka> okay
[05:37:29] <hokapoka> thanks
[05:37:39] <Cork> as in ^= and $=
[05:37:56] <Kambfhase> hokapoka: $(selector).filter(function(){ return /regexp/.test($(this).attr("foo")})
[05:38:26] <hokapoka> I'm trying to find all inputs of a from so I can concatinate them into a XHR post/get for the form
[05:38:45] <Cork> ?.serialize @ hokapoka
[05:38:45] <bot-t> hokapoka, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:39:13] <hokapoka> So I was looking for .find"oh sweet
[05:39:19] <hokapoka> opps, oh sweet.
[05:39:22] <hokapoka> Thnaks Cork
[05:39:24] <johnline3> wow cork, i wasnt expecting such a pro autoanswer
[05:39:27] <johnline3> thanks i'll try it
[05:44:48] <johnline3> with some tweaking, IT WERK!
[05:44:51] <johnline3> thanks cork
[06:05:07] <bmustiata> Hi all, I am wondering who should I ask if I want a bug reopened, or what's the general way into approaching this.
[06:05:57] <ajpiano> bmustiata: patience help
[06:05:57] <bot-t> (2 hours 53 mins ago) <addyosmani> tell ajpiano danheberden be nice to catch up about the learning site at some point :)
[06:06:04] <ajpiano> patience helps*
[06:06:19] <ajpiano> bmustiata: i see the point of your request
[06:06:32] <terryleigh> I'm using .append on a li.. but it's replacing everything in the li? is it supposed to do that?
[06:06:35] <johnline3> http://www.perspectiveaia.com/ here is result, on artist of the month
[06:06:45] <ajpiano> bmustiata: i will reopen the ticket and tag it for 1.8 discussion
[06:07:27] <ajpiano> bmustiata: i just happened to wake up and read your reply
[06:10:21] <bmustiata> ajpiano: ok. I was wondering if I can make the test suite pass for 1.7 if we can go for it in 1.7.
[06:10:42] <ajpiano> was just about to comment to that effect
[06:10:45] <bmustiata> ajpiano: since I can create a test that fails for $('<customdata>asd</customdata>') at this stage.
[06:11:09] <ajpiano> bmustiata: it's too late for 1.7 inclusion
[06:11:31] <bmustiata> ajpiano: ah, ok.
[06:11:32] <ajpiano> and it's a new and separate feature that should probably be given a full discussion in the core team for 1.8
[06:12:05] <ajpiano> more like, it's too late for 1.7 inclusion *because* it's a new and separate feature.... :)
[06:14:49] <nVee> Hey there, I would like to change the bg color of "even" divs in a main div called #step2. I have it as $("#step2 div:even").css("background","#CCC"); but this does not change anything, what am I doing wrong? :)
[06:15:16] <bmustiata> ajpiano: for us it is a bug, since we get a different behavior between browsers when creating the exact same content, and is really frustrating.
[06:15:27] <nVee> the divs within the #step2 is purely called <div></div>
[06:15:58] <bmustiata> ajpiano: and for IE8 there is no difference between <nav> and <customcontent>
[06:16:26] <bmustiata> ajpiano: so this difference that it is in html5 is completely artificial (imho).
[06:17:53] <kborchers> nVee: background-color
[06:19:08] <jcrawford-home> hey guys is there any reason these $.ajax calls would not work?  I have debugged this all the way to that point but execution seems to stop as soon as it hits the $.ajax calls: http://jsfiddle.net/GQLDB/
[06:20:04] <NodeX> jcrawford-home : which one doesnt work or is it both
[06:20:07] <Clorith> this jqueryui.it site, is it official? Because it did some funky shit to my browser...
[06:20:47] <jcrawford-home> NodeX: the one I KNOW does not work is the one under selected elseif statement
[06:21:04] <kborchers> Clorith: NO!
[06:21:13] <ajpiano> bmustiata: i totally get what you're saying, but while it may be a bug for you, it's a new feature for us
[06:21:29] <ajpiano> uch there's jqueryui.it now too
[06:21:30] <ajpiano> ://
[06:21:40] <NodeX> try instead for me .. if(confirm('Are you sure ........
[06:21:50] <NodeX> rather than var response=();
[06:21:59] <ajpiano> Clorith: it's some spammer who illicitly is mirroring the site
[06:22:08] <ajpiano> was doing it for jquery.it but we shut that down
[06:22:34] <jcrawford-home> NodeX it get's past that point
[06:22:45] <jcrawford-home> I can alert response and it gives the true value when true
[06:23:06] <NodeX> drop the last comma after the jGrowl line
[06:23:18] <NodeX> that;s on the else if one ...
[06:24:09] <bmustiata> ajpiano: I understand and I agree completely.
[06:24:14] <jcrawford-home> nope
[06:24:22] <jcrawford-home> still alerts true for the response but then does nothing
[06:24:33] <ajpiano> bmustiata: cool - we'll see what happens in the 1.8 feature discussion :)
[06:24:48] <NodeX> it can't be finding the checked checkboxes then
[06:25:11] <NodeX> drop the var users=
[06:25:12] <NodeX> lol
[06:25:54] <jcrawford-home> nope ajax still seems useless lol
[06:26:33] <jcrawford-home> yea apopears it is not finding the checkboxes because the alert of user_id in there does nothing
[06:26:38] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/eHaAz/
[06:26:39] <NodeX>  tr that
[06:26:41] <NodeX> try *
[06:26:53] <NodeX> see if it cosole.logs(users)
[06:27:01] <jcrawford-home> haha my bad
[06:27:02] <Remon_> Anyone by any chance experience with "IOS app development"?
[06:27:11] <jcrawford-home> i had id="#testUser_Checkbox" DOH
[06:27:36] <NodeX> steve jobs ?
[06:28:07] <hokapoka> NodeX: logs <- that a typo or some special method for console that renders arrays neatly?
[06:28:25] <Rushing> is there a correct/build-in way of extending a jquery ui widget?
[06:28:26] <NodeX> typo
[06:28:27] <jcrawford-home> hmm that still did not fix it :)
[06:28:59] <jcrawford-home> funny part is there are no errors in the console :(
[06:29:02] <NodeX> can you pastebin your markup too >
[06:29:08] <jcrawford-home> so why would it not find my checkboxes the id's are correct
[06:29:12] <jcrawford-home> sure one moment
[06:29:17] <Rushing> i'd like to do something like $.widget("my.customwidget", "my.customwidget2", {overrideSomething});
[06:30:57] <jcrawford-home> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/GQLDB/1/
[06:31:49] <jcrawford-home> NodeX: even better: http://jsfiddle.net/GQLDB/2/
[06:31:51] <NodeX> change id="testUser_checkbox" to class=""
[06:32:01] <NodeX> infact I'll fork it for you
[06:33:02] <jcrawford-home> why class?
[06:33:08] <jcrawford-home> I am accessing by ID not class
[06:33:54] <jcrawford-home> brb
[06:34:09] <airstrike> i have a page at foo.com/bar that is basically empty, except for one $.ajax() call which fetches data from the same url (foo.com/bar) and then renders a nice table.
[06:34:25] <airstrike> the problem with this approach is that firefox interprets the result from ajax call as the 'source code' for the page
[06:34:59] <airstrike> which means reopening a closed tab that was at foo.com/bar, or hitting CTRL+U shows me a huge json object
[06:35:02] <airstrike> how can i prevent this?
[06:37:08] <NodeX> jcrawford-home : http://jsfiddle.net/GQLDB/3/
[06:37:25] <gsommer> Has anyone ever gotten the tablesort plugin to work with shortdates? (dd/mm/yyy). I've tried what the documentation says - but I cannot get it to sort correctly. Did I miss something here?  Sample-code: http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.html
[06:38:11] <jcrawford-home> looking
[06:38:41] <jcrawford-home> so why would class work but not id?
[06:39:43] <jcrawford-home> NodeX: that does not work either actually
[06:40:07] <jcrawford-home> I try to alert the user_id and get nothing
[06:40:15] <NodeX> id's have to be unique
[06:40:30] <jcrawford-home> ah right
[06:40:41] <jcrawford-home> let me rework my code maybe its just not working on jsfiddle :)
[06:40:42] <jcrawford-home> moment
[06:42:05] <NodeX> it wont work on fiddle because the url doesnt work lol
[06:42:17] <jcrawford-home> nope class is not working either :(
[06:44:13] <michael_imac> hi anyone here use Knockout?  I'm trying to increase a variable that's present in each observableArray element
[06:44:43] <michael_imac> the reason is I'm templating a JS video player and it needs a unique div id and player instance defined in its script as well.
[06:44:54] <jcrawford-home> NodeX: did not work ;(
[06:45:15] <jcrawford-home> still does not alert the user_id so i am assuming it still is not finding the checkboxes.  I did change id= to class= on my checkboxes
[06:45:21] <NodeX> I just get deleteTestUsersBtn is null
[06:46:28] <jcrawford-home> i get nothing in my console
[06:47:53] <NodeX> omg
[06:47:56] <michael_imac> lo?
[06:48:01] <NodeX> did you even look on the tools to include lol
[06:48:16] <michael_imac> any ideas?
[06:48:28] <jcrawford-home> confirmed it is nopt finding the checkboxes
[06:48:38] <jcrawford-home> i put alert before the each, inside the each and after the each
[06:48:43] <jcrawford-home> the only ones triggered are before and after
[06:49:31] <jcrawford-home> will work on this more when i get to the office have to shower now then head in :)
[06:49:41] <jcrawford-home> thanks for the assistance NodeX im sure i will be back in an  hour or so :)
[06:49:59] <NodeX> nps
[06:50:04] <dannN> Hi, jQuery with noConflict works fine if i'm including mootools, then jquery, then my JS file with jquery manipulation. does this also work if the scripts are compressed to one file? the order of the files is the same
[06:50:04] <NodeX> your proper fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/GQLDB/13/
[06:50:52] <NodeX> yes
[06:51:07] <dannN> or does i have to make changes?
[06:51:15] <NodeX> include in the same order
[06:51:27] <NodeX> inline or 1 flie si the same
[06:52:57] <dannN> NodeX: This works fine http://pastebin.com/u2dGwNJr --- But this doesn't work (compiled to one file): http://pastebin.com/VQBHTtSG
[06:53:18] <dannN> its the same order and the same content like before
[06:57:17] <dannN> MooTools still works great, just jQuery doesn't work in the compressed and merges version
[06:57:49] <gsommer> Has anyone ever gotten the tablesort plugin to work with shortdates? (dd/mm/yyy). I've tried what the documentation says - but I cannot get it to sort correctly. Did I miss something here?  Sample-code: http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.html
[07:02:37] <DarsVaeda> is there an event that is the same for all form elements when i change them? aka enter something in an input or textfield, change a select, radio button
[07:03:37] <NodeX> change()
[07:04:18] <DarsVaeda> select() means literally select the items?
[07:04:31] <dannN> NodeX: Do you have an idea, why the script doesn't work in compressed and combined mode?
[07:05:19] <michael_imac> NodeX you there?
[07:05:56] <michael_imac> http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/jw-player-for-flash-v5/12538/supported-player-embed-methods#swfobject
[07:06:11] <michael_imac> Notice how it needs a unique 'player' and 'container' attribute
[07:06:18] <michael_imac> how can I template this in with Knockout?
[07:12:08] <torbjorn> according to docs, xpath should be supported, but I keep getting unrecognized expression when I try with $("/html")
[07:14:00] <gsommer> Has anyone ever gotten the tablesort plugin to work with shortdates? (dd/mm/yyy). I've tried what the documentation says - but I cannot get it to sort correctly. Did I miss something here?  Sample-code: http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.html
[07:20:07] <antihero> If I want a bar to stay at the top of the page, can I do that with CSS or is JQuery necessary?
[07:20:39] <NodeX> position:static
[07:20:47] <NodeX> but ... IE6 doesn't respoect it iirc
[07:20:51] <Raverix> Ugh...
[07:20:56] <NodeX> respect *
[07:20:57] <Raverix> So I've got 1000 lines of custom jquery.
[07:21:10] <NodeX> congrats :P
[07:21:21] <Raverix> And I tried it in IE8 and I've got an error in jQuery.js, line 6, character 20230...
[07:21:34] <Raverix> I don't suppose there's an easy way to figure out which of my calls is invoking that?
[07:21:43] <NodeX> setup break points...
[07:22:02] <NodeX> I allways do "alert('got here');" and move it 20 lines at a time
[07:22:54] <NodeX> sounds like you have your js concactted into 1 file
[07:23:04] <NodeX> might be an idea to not do that when debugging
[07:23:16] <kborchers> ?demo @ Raverix
[07:23:16] <bot-t> Raverix, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:23:19] <Altreus> Is there a function similar to serialize() that gets the data as an object rather than a URL string?
[07:23:37] <Altreus> er a query string
[07:23:45] <erichynds> ?g ben alman serializeObject @ Altreus
[07:23:46] <bot-t> Altreus, Ben Alman » jQuery Misc plugins - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[07:23:46] <Altreus> er. An object rather than a query string.
[07:23:50] <Altreus> oh :)
[07:23:56] <kborchers> ?serializeArray @ Altreus
[07:23:56] <bot-t> Altreus, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:24:01] <Altreus> that guy saves my life on a regualr basis
[07:24:05] <Raverix> kborchers: I think that might be a bit premature until I narrow this down a lil bit.
[07:24:46] <Altreus> thanks chaps/chapettes
[07:25:15] <timing>   
[07:25:25] <kborchers> Raverix: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[07:25:28] <Altreus> bad timing!
[07:26:26] <Raverix> I am familiar with how to debug javascript.
[07:26:31] <terryleigh> I'm loading a form with .load, however the .InFieldLabels plugin doesn't work correctly with it.. any ideas why?
[07:26:35] <Raverix> The question was more out of frustration than anything else.
[07:26:38] <dreinull> can I alternate between tab and dialog use of an element?
[07:26:52] <Altreus> kthxbai, as they say
[07:27:00] <NodeX> I dont see the alert() problem myself, it's just as quick
[07:27:11] <Raverix> NodeX: It's not concactted... this files deals with a lot of AJAX / Animations of the site.
[07:27:15] <jannn> Hi, can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Fyvws/ why does the image not scrink again on second click?
[07:27:24] <jannn> shrink*
[07:27:39] <kborchers> NodeX: how useful is this [object Object]? that's why you no alert!
[07:27:54] <NodeX> I never alert them
[07:28:02] <NodeX> [15:22:02] <NodeX> I allways do "alert('got here');" and move it 20 lines at a time
[07:28:31] <NodeX> but then I dont write broken javascript so it doesn't happens that often
[07:30:49] * kborchers[A] is set as away : Reason(brb)
[07:30:59] * kborchers is no longer away : Gone for 9 secs
[07:31:08] <antihero> Yeah so what's the nicest way to get a div to stay at the top or bottom of the page?
[07:31:43] <antihero> I've tried cchanging $('div').top() to equal $(window).scrollTop() on $(window).scroll() but that flickers and is generally horrible
[07:32:01] <NodeX> css
[07:32:13] <NodeX> position:absolute;top:0;left:0
[07:32:36] <lmatteis> how do i avoid getJSON from appending random string to my url calls?
[07:32:50] <Raverix> Interesting... $(this).data('data',data); - This is the line which is causing jQuery to choke.
[07:32:51] <antihero> NodeX: But that doesn't stay there on scrolls
[07:32:58] <antihero> I need it to be like the facebook bar
[07:33:10] <NodeX> ah right so it's scrollTop
[07:33:29] <NodeX> Raverix : console.log(data) at
[07:33:33] <NodeX> at that point *
[07:33:43] <warrenparsons> Have you tried using CSS? position: fixed works in modern browsers.
[07:33:45] <NodeX> probably some reserved word
[07:34:27] <Raverix> $(this).data('data',''); - This also makes jQuery die.
[07:34:46] <NodeX> ?data
[07:34:46] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:35:04] <Pallet> hi all
[07:35:14] <jannn> Hi, can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Fyvws/ why does the image not shrink again on  a second click?
[07:35:43] <Pallet> I'm doing jQuery("#wizardbox").fadeIn(100); but I need a way to if "it's not already visible then jQuery("#wizardbox").fadeIn(100); " can anyone please help
[07:35:47] <NodeX> Raverix : perhaps change the object name it's storing to not be "data"
[07:36:00] <Raverix> NodeX: Tried that well, put $(this).data('test', "");
[07:36:12] <NodeX> no no the value
[07:36:31] <Raverix> $(this).data('test', "test"); - dies.
[07:36:31] <warrenparsons> janne: Because you're binding the event once on doc ready, but updating the class in response to user action. You need to delegate your event handler to catch elements that get the class added after the document is loaded.
[07:36:34] <NodeX> var d= {foo:'bar'}  $(this).data('data',d);
[07:36:41] <NodeX> ah
[07:36:56] <Raverix> Got it...
[07:37:00] <NodeX> is $(this) valid at that point and is writeable
[07:37:06] <NodeX> i.e not document or window
[07:37:15] <Raverix> This method works with both DOM elements and XML documents...
[07:37:21] <Raverix> .data breaks with XML Documents
[07:37:42] <NodeX> Note that this method currently does not provide cross-platform support for setting data on XML documents, as Internet Explorer does not allow data to be attached via expando properties.
[07:37:52] <NodeX> lmfao
[07:37:55] <warrenparsons> janne: Try this - http://jsfiddle.net/Fyvws/2/
[07:37:56] <Raverix> Damn.
[07:38:02] <Raverix> Well, at least it's documnted.
[07:38:05] <NodeX> IEx is the sux0r
[07:38:18] <Raverix> Indeed.
[07:38:20] <Raverix> Fuck IE.
[07:38:25] <Raverix> Excuse my language.
[07:38:41] <NodeX> I hate it, I stopped supporting IE6 like 2 years ago
[07:38:51] <Raverix> Well, this is IE8.
[07:39:04] <usingTheSystem> #javascript
[07:39:21] <warrenparsons> janne: Though you'd be better off just grabbing a reference to the element once, and then setting a flag class on each click, and checking against that class to decide whether to enlarge or shrink.
[07:39:21] <NodeX> Development in chrome / ff = 5 days .. making it work in all IE browsers 50 days
[07:39:35] <adrianp> ie9 wouldn't be so bad if extension development was a little less convoluted
[07:39:39] <Pallet> did my question make any sense ?
[07:39:52] <jannn> warrenparsons: Thanks. Should I keep that in mind? that i should access objects that were altered with live() ?
[07:40:06] <adrianp> i doubt ie10 will be any better
[07:40:10] <Raverix> I wonder if I could overwrite the .data function with my own... test if XML, and do a custom storage method, otherwise pass to original...
[07:40:27] <Raverix> In theory I could write that in a way which wouldn't break future versions, just invoke the original method with all arguments.
[07:40:40] <NodeX> Pallet : var element=$("#wizradbox"); .. if(element.is(":hidden")) { element.fadeIn() } else { element.fadeOut }
[07:40:45] <NodeX> +();
[07:41:03] <warrenparsons> jannn: It depends. live(), delegate(), on() with delegation should mostly be used for elements that get dynamically added to the document. When you're dealing with a static element whose state just changes, it's much more performant to just set/remove a flag. By comparison, event delegation is expensive.
[07:41:07] <Pallet> NodeX, brilliant
[07:41:08] <Pallet> thanks
[07:41:15] <NodeX> :)
[07:41:59] <jannn> warrenparsons: ok, thanks
[07:44:17] <antihero> position: fixed
[07:44:21] <antihero> probleme solved
[07:46:13] <michael_imac> hello
[07:46:21] <michael_imac> anyone here know KnockoutJS?
[07:46:37] <Pallet> NodeX, that worked a treat, thanks
[07:47:53] <michael_imac> NodeX: Trying to paginate multiple JWplayer instances but on changing through the paginated elements, the player loads with an error - please install flash.
[07:49:10] <inad922> anyone knows which api shall I use to get back search results from google maps in some xml or json format?
[07:50:26] <jcrawford> ok at the office now :D
[07:50:42] <jcrawford> NodeX: do you still have that Fiddle URL by chance?
[07:52:25] <jcrawford> very odd if I do alert($(".testUser_Checkbox :checked")); I get [object Object] but it won't go into the each for some odd reason
[07:57:56] <thun> I have a small loop that goes three times and makes 3 ajax requests ... it works fine once they load from within each request I call jquery auto complete ui combo box once from each request... that all works fine EXCEPT when I hit the back button SOMETIMES one or two of the combo boxes will not apply
[07:58:11] <thun> it is not a on a regular basis and only when hitting back button
[07:58:14] <thun> any ideas?
[07:59:42] <jcrawford> anyone that can assist me with why this is not picking up on the checked checkboxes? http://jsfiddle.net/CDtSw/4/
[08:00:35] <jcrawford> i've simplified the code to just alert the value of the checkbox when the button is clicked but it's not actually getting into the .each()
[08:01:31] <bobholt> jcrawford: not sure exactly why, but this works: http://jsfiddle.net/CDtSw/5/
[08:01:59] <bobholt> i would expect it to work your way, too
[08:02:02] <jcrawford> hmm that is strange
[08:02:12] <jcrawford> why would my way not work is the question :) possibly a bug in JQuery?
[08:02:26] <bobholt> ah, wait
[08:02:47] <jcrawford> guess the chances of a bug are slim since many people probably do this every day lol
[08:02:54] <bobholt> yeah, you just need to delete the space between ...Checkbox and :checked
[08:03:06] <jcrawford> ahhh ok
[08:03:12] <jcrawford> thanks for that correction :)
[08:03:18] <bobholt> because it's the same selector - not a descendant
[08:08:41] <jmar777> a little bit OT, but does anyone know of some good literature on synchronous ajax bricking IE?
[08:15:38] <jcrawford> anyone here have experience with the datatables.net jquery plugin.  I am talking about modifying the rows using the API and such so not a simple question :)
[08:16:47] <lduros> is there a best practice regarding the length of strings that should be passed inside a data attribute with $().data(key, val); -- I'm getting long strings from json and placing them inside a data attribute for later reference. But just wondering if there isn't a better method (Maybe using an array, if the strings are long)
[08:16:49] <lduros> thx
[08:17:43] <NodeX> ludros: an Array is just more memory for no gain
[08:17:45] <jmar777> lduros: using an array would only make things heavier weight. how long are you talking about?
[08:17:54] <sodapop_> i am trying to add a tip in an <img> element (using poshytip which reads title) what is the best way to do this ?
[08:18:24] <sodapop_> have the <img> in <a href="#">?
[08:18:38] <NodeX> $("#you-image").attr("title","The tip text ?");
[08:19:36] <lduros> jmar777 NodeX: really? I would have expected the opposite. Right now I'm taking strings from json, and placing them within data attributes in <a> tags, so that I can retrieve them in a lightbox later on click. I thought placing stuff in an array with a key corresponding to the :eq of the a tags would be less expensive :-P I guess arrays in js are just not like C arrays (lol)
[08:20:16] <sodapop_> NodeX : i think poshytip cant bind on <img>
[08:20:29] <NodeX> sodapop_ : check the authors site
[08:20:34] <NodeX> or  #poshytip
[08:21:07] <NodeX> you asked how to add a tip to an element that uses title
[08:21:21] <jmar777> lduros: well, keep in mind that when you use `data(key, val)` to store something, it doesn't actually get stored on the DOM node or in a physical attribute
[08:21:47] <NodeX> plus hashes are cached in memory nicely whereas arrays are not iirc
[08:22:14] <sodapop_> NodeX: but generally you don't get tooltips when you hover over <img>
[08:22:27] <NodeX> yes you do lol
[08:22:35] <NodeX> anything with a title gives a browser tip
[08:22:59] <jmar777> lduros: the DOM node will only be updated with a key (one time only) that is used to look up data values in a hash stored external to the DOM. it's a lot faster this way because you have less DOM manipulation going on, and it's useful for preventing memory leaks
[08:24:17] <airstrike> sorry, i completely forgot i had asked a question
[08:24:26] <airstrike> and the buffer on this webchat is way too short for me to scroll back
[08:24:29] <airstrike> i have a page at foo.com/bar that is basically empty, except for one $.ajax() call which fetches data from the same url (foo.com/bar) and then renders a nice table.
[08:24:34] <airstrike> the problem with this approach is that firefox interprets the result from ajax call as the 'source code' for the page
[08:24:36] <jmar777> lduros: so, as long as you're using the `data()` API for storing the value, then you're going to have virtually identical memory characteristics to using an array. either way it's on the stack and out of the DOM
[08:24:37] <airstrike> which means reopening a closed tab that was at foo.com/bar, or hitting CTRL+U shows me a huge json object
[08:24:40] <airstrike> how can i prevent this?
[08:28:40] <airstrike> if anyone has a solution, please pm me
[08:34:52] <thun> I have a loop that makes three ajax calls .get ... usualy works fine except when I hit bac button somes times one of the requests does not go through. Two lines will load and one wont... sometimes. I checked and it is only making two requests to the webserver. Does for loop go so fast it causes race condition sometimes for .get?
[08:34:56] <thun> do I have to pause or something
[08:35:26] <thun> the browser thinks its making three requests and just waits for the last one
[08:35:36] <thun> but it never actually got submitted to the server

[09:05:58] <dabear> akahn: that is not a jquery object
[09:06:01] <kborchers> akahn: because you are trying to call live on the dom element itself and not a jQuery object.
[09:06:02] <dabear> it is a dom object

[09:06:13] <akahn> it APPEARS that awy

[09:15:21] <bot-t> doup, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:15:49] <enjoycrf> y do u do that ask thing its so annoying
[09:15:56] <doup> I've a set of connect lists in a sortable
[09:16:10] <doup> but I want to dynamically create new ones
[09:16:36] <enjoycrf> ?ask @ <kborchers>
[09:16:36] <bot-t> <kborchers>, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:16:38] <kborchers> enjoycrf: why do you keep making pointless comments. it's so annoying
[09:16:43] <doup> i've some lists that are "special" so they clone themselves, emtpy, and add the item
[09:16:50] <doup> so it creates a new connected list
[09:17:31] <doup> now, this new elements are not recognized by the sortable
[09:17:48] <doup> so they are not dropable areas, nor the inner elements are sortable anymore
[09:17:50] <enjoycrf> i think u have to let sortable know
[09:17:55] <enjoycrf> of new elements
[09:18:03] <doup> i've tried with sortable("refresh")
[09:18:22] <enjoycrf> do u have firebug
[09:18:36] <enjoycrf> check if sortable is being applied to those items
[09:18:54] <doup> yes, I've firebug
[09:19:13] <kborchers> doup: try clone(true, true) but you may need to recreate the sortable on the cloned elements see ?clone
[09:19:13] <bot-t> doup, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[09:19:28] <dabear> cant you just destroy the widget and call .sortable() again?
[09:21:30] <doup> dabear, I can
[09:21:43] <doup> just willing if there was another way
[09:23:20] <eric_lewis> is anyone familiar with imposing an image over another using jcrop?
[09:23:23] <doup> kborchers, you say that i must recreate the sortable on the cloned elements, what do you mean?
[09:23:28] <eric_lewis> or if that's easily possible with jcrop
[09:24:18] <kborchers> doup: after you clone the dom elements, you would call sortable() on the clone. haven't tried it though
[09:28:28] <doup> i'll try destroying the sortable and recreating it...
[09:30:06] <doup> well, must go, thank you!
[09:30:07] <akahn> how come jquery doesn't have a function to serialize a form's data and return it as an object?
[09:30:11] <doup> i'll try later again
[09:31:44] <ajpiano> akahn: ben has a plugin that does it, i think we might put it in core
[09:31:54] <akahn> ajpiano: that seems like a really good idea
[09:32:03] <ajpiano> i'd check trac but i can't
[09:32:04] <akahn> serializeArray seems so promising, but then...
[09:32:08] <akahn> ajpiano: why not
[09:32:08] <ajpiano> amtrak webfilter
[09:32:14] <akahn> hahaha
[09:32:21] <akahn> WARNING ADULT CONTENT

[09:33:40] <adamjleonard> Does anyone know of a way and or example that emulates something along the lines of this flash site http://www.fluidagency.pl/
[09:33:48] <adamjleonard> When you click the arrow it has like a page flip effect
[09:34:03] <adamjleonard> I'm aware it's more or less possible with css3 transitions, but wondering if there's another route
[09:38:37] <yedimind> oh! speaking of downloading
[09:38:40] <yedimind> hi ajpiano !
[09:38:41] <yedimind> :)
[09:54:11] <jeffsmykil> and now we wait for #css to first insult me, then look at my question, then insult me at how dumb I am not to know the answer, then not tell me the answer
[09:55:26] <bid> hi, i have a question about trigger events. say i want to "fake" Esc key pressing. i can do this$('#elm').trigger(myEvent); but my question is, does broswer plugins (toolbar) also think that Esc key was pressed or its just in the window? hope i am being clear
[09:56:00] <bid> "window scope"

[10:07:29] <teratios> hi, is it possible that the values of newly created DOM elements (checkboxes, after ajax call) won't be submitted in POST action?
[10:08:37] <bryanbuchanan> Hello! Does anyone know of a plugin that would allow me to easily grab the number of Twitter followers, Facebook likes, Youtube subscribers, and Google +1s that a user has?
[10:14:58] <bid> teratios: is is inside the form?
[10:17:12] <teratios> yes bid... everything checked :/
[10:18:00] <teratios> they're inside the form, they have the same names with a [] added
[10:18:04] <teratios> not that it matters
[10:18:10] <teratios> and still can't view them
[10:19:01] <warrenparsons> bryanbuchanan: That's a little much for a plugin, and would probably be a web service, if it were even feasible.
[10:20:21] <bryanbuchanan> warrenparsons, yeah I think you're right. It'd probably have to be through some proxy service like Yahoo's or AddThis or something
[10:20:53] <warrenparsons> bryanbuchanan: It would also make the assumption that a user has the same username for all those services, which many (including me) do not.
[10:21:32] <bryanbuchanan> warrenparons: Good point!
[10:22:30] <warrenparsons> bryanbuchanan: You could probably build something that would talk to all of those services individually to display a user's info, but it would only be visible to that user - like when you're logged into Facebook and view a site that includes one of their sidebars.
[10:23:13] <ScottO_> any idea why i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined in jquery validation plugin?
[10:23:47] <ScottO_> the errors only seem to be in the validation plugin
[10:23:55] <bryanbuchanan> warrenparsons, yeahâ¦ I think what I'm going to have to do is just make my own script that pings the different api's separatelyâ¦ Since Facebook and Twitter have require the OAuth or whatever now
[10:24:13] <beakybal4> hey all
[10:24:42] <beakybal4> i have code that increments the div with id "bla"
[10:24:57] <[1]teratios> well I am reading that it has to do with forms inside table tags... for some reason this goes as child of table element and not form, although i might add it somewhere in the form tags
[10:25:12] <beakybal4> but how do i get it to the code to increment the div within the same div that the onclick item is?
[10:25:13] <BinaryKitten> beakybal4  define "increments" for me
[10:25:30] <beakybal4> BinaryKitten: takes value, converts to integer, increases by one, puts value
[10:25:35] <BinaryKitten> ah ok
[10:26:06] <beakybal4> I can do that
[10:26:18] <beakybal4> i just need for it to only take the value of a sibling div
[10:26:35] <beakybal4> basically i don't know how to use $(this) when navigating DOM structures :/
[10:26:43] <beakybal4> and google didn't help :/
[10:26:45] <BinaryKitten> $('#blah').click(function() { var me = $(this); me.text(parsInt(me.text()) +1); return false; });  beakybal4
[10:27:20] <BinaryKitten> there is a deliberate mistake in there beakybal4
[10:27:33] <beakybal4> mmm
[10:27:43] <BinaryKitten> honestly i meant to see if you would notice that parsInt should have been parseInt
[10:27:55] <BinaryKitten> :p
[10:27:57] <beakybal4> :p
[10:27:58] <ScottO_> in firefox the problem identifies itself with this error "$.validator.methods[method] is undefined"
[10:28:08] <jqueryNoob> Not sure of the etiquette here... whats the best way to ask a question?
[10:28:15] <BinaryKitten> jqueryNoob just ask
[10:28:20] <beakybal4> jqueryNoob: to ask it and see if someone helpful answers
[10:28:22] <gnarf> ?ask
[10:28:23] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:28:32] <BinaryKitten> ScottO_  what are you definiing the validation method as?
[10:28:55] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: not sure, the stacktrace only shows the validation plugin lines
[10:29:05] <ScottO_> no lines from my script are mentioned
[10:29:44] <jqueryNoob> thanks. I am working in jquery 1.6.4 and have the following issue.... I have an html tag of <table multiple="false"> jquery $('table').attr('multiple')  should return false, but it return multiple
[10:29:45] <BinaryKitten> ScottO_  urm you need to define validation rules for the fields
[10:29:59] <ScottO_> i did
[10:30:08] <ScottO_> and they all have messages too
[10:30:10] <BinaryKitten> in that you have methods
[10:30:22] <BinaryKitten> which validation method you want to use
[10:30:26] <ScottO_> i only use maxlength and required
[10:30:31] <ScottO_> both are standard
[10:30:36] <BinaryKitten> one of the rules is broken and doesn't have the right value
[10:31:00] <BinaryKitten> jqueryNoob it's because the atrr multiple doesn't accept "false" as a value
[10:31:07] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: i noticed the error comes up on a rule i add with an ajax call
[10:31:24] <BinaryKitten> then that would be the cause
[10:31:29] <ScottO_> ah your right
[10:31:31] <BinaryKitten> check what method you are using :)
[10:31:35] <BinaryKitten> it's not jquery's issue here jqueryNoob
[10:31:39] <ScottO_> missing a rule i had in a previous page
[10:31:46] <ScottO_> oops
[10:31:55] <miceiken> (function($) { $('#upload-toggle').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('#upload-container').toggle();})})(jQuery); <- what's wrong, i get no errors in firebug and nothing happens
[10:31:57] <ScottO_> greaterThanZero isnt a standard method
[10:32:04] <jqueryNoob> @Binary Kitten ... multiple on a table is not standard... I would assume it should be treated as a non-standard attribute?
[10:32:18] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: why cant it just say, "rule does not exist"
[10:32:38] <ScottO_> could use better error messages, but thanks!
[10:32:42] <BinaryKitten> because it assumes you know what you are doing :)
[10:32:49] <BinaryKitten> and it's a Javascript error
[10:32:49] <kborchers> ?data @ jqueryNoob
[10:32:50] <bot-t> jqueryNoob, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:32:56] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: i do, i just get lost in the code sometimes
[10:32:59] <BinaryKitten> jqueryNoob basically in html attributes like multiple, etc depending on the browser will get the attribute
[10:33:13] <BinaryKitten> eg multiple is a valid attribute, but not on the table
[10:33:15] <ScottO_> too much to keep in active memory :P
[10:33:29] <ScottO_> i need a memory upgrade
[10:33:37] <BinaryKitten> so according to the rules multiple=ANYTHING will make multiple=multiple
[10:33:47] <BinaryKitten> since that is it's standard value
[10:34:19] <BinaryKitten> if you dont want a multiple, then don't specifiy the attribute.. or as kborchers as said use data attributes
[10:34:48] <BinaryKitten> sudo apt-get install ScottO_Memory_Uprage
[10:35:40] <jqueryNoob> @BinaryKitten... thanks... that is what I assumed was happening, but I wanted to check before I tell the boss man that using standard attributes names in a non standard way is a bad idea.
[10:36:03] <BinaryKitten> jqueryNoob  try data-multiple="false"
[10:36:12] <BinaryKitten> then in jquery use .data('multiple')
[10:38:15] <jqueryNoob> Will try now!
[10:38:21] <BinaryKitten> :)
[10:42:29] <webe> I'm trying to find an element that is being added to the left menu via js. Can someone please help me? The link is http://audiobook.playawaydigital.com/genres
[10:43:11] <jqueryNoob> @BinaryKitten and kborchers: the data approach works. Jquery is rather new to me... is this the "standard" way of setting/getting non-standard attributes?
[10:43:59] <kborchers> jqueryNoob: non-standard as in data-attributes, yes
[10:44:25] <BinaryKitten> jqueryNoob nope
[10:44:53] <BinaryKitten> it's for data  which is stored by jquery. data-XXXX type attributes are html5/new js stuff
[10:45:01] <BinaryKitten> that jquery has now built in support for
[10:47:24] <enjoycrf> hay exuse me
[10:47:29] <enjoycrf> var params = $("#order_form").serialize();
[10:47:37] <enjoycrf> how do i get that into obj
[10:49:24] <kborchers> enjoycrf: serializeArray will give you an array of objects
[10:49:28] <jqueryNoob> One more quick question... is there way to tell if an image is loaded from cache using jquery? I am tryign to make sure an image is loaded prior to some action
[10:49:33] <enjoycrf> i kno
[10:49:40] <enjoycrf> thats an ugly obj tho
[10:49:53] <enjoycrf> i jus want simple pairs
[10:50:57] <enjoycrf> u can do an $.post to an image
[10:51:10] <enjoycrf> and just place the action in complete
[10:52:09] <uho> I'm trying to get an element to fade in and out. What is wrong with my approach? http://pastie.org/2650852
[10:52:14] <kborchers> enjoycrf: you could try cowboy's serializeObject plugin http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[10:52:34] <enjoycrf> dam friken cowboy is owning

[11:17:13] <beakybal4> hmm
[11:20:11] <beakybal4> yedimind: that didn't work as intended
[11:20:21] <beakybal4> wait
[11:20:22] <beakybal4> :/
[11:21:13] <enjoycrf> im in the process of deleting everything
[11:21:47] <yedimind> what
[11:22:32] <enjoycrf> im doing some house cleaning
[11:23:04] <enjoycrf> since no 1 can code properly
[11:23:20] <enjoycrf> and heavy lack of organization on top
[11:25:03] <here4thegear> I'm calling a function on keyup. This function makes an ajax call. Is there any possible way to kill all current Ajax calls so that it doesn't have to wait to finish the previous call before doing the next one?
[11:25:10] <hacksparrow> both seems to be the same thing. i need some more customization. thanks guys for the tip, i'll work on it further.
[11:25:32] <enjoycrf> awesum
[11:25:46] <hacksparrow> here4thegear, push all the calls to an array, onkeyup loop through the array and kill them all
[11:26:44] <ajpiano> here4thegear: it's also better to debounce the keyup event so it only requests after the user stops typing instead of every keystroke
[11:27:20] <kborchers> here4thegear: check out the jqXHR abort() method
[11:27:35] <kborchers> or what ajpiano said ;)
[11:28:55] <here4thegear> all cool suggestions... ajpiano how do you debounce?
[11:29:35] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, I have the need to confirm that no select element in a form has the same selected option as any other select element -- anyone have a plugin/advice for this?

[11:31:39] <here4thegear> imsky: brilliant
[11:31:44] <here4thegear> ajpiano: thanks.
[11:32:22] <Dave_Stein> imsky why are you and allman talking about that batman regex? noticedo n twitter
[11:32:38] <imsky> Dave_Stein: it's not really a regex, just doing my part tho
[11:33:06] <Dave_Stein> imsky: ah ya know i didnt read that whole line, i know the one on twitter is using regex ha
[11:34:26] <jcrawford> is there a way to get a count of selected checkboxes kinda like you can with each: $(".testUser_Checkbox").each(?
[11:34:41] <Dave_Stein> $('.checkboxes').filter(':checked').length
[11:34:49] <imsky> $("input:checkbox:checked").length
[11:35:11] <jcrawford> thanks
[11:35:11] <t4nkd> In a .change() function for a select, how can I capture the new selected value? $(this).val() ?
[11:35:23] <Dave_Stein> t3nkd yes
[11:35:27] <t4nkd> cool ty
[11:35:28] <Dave_Stein> and 54nkd yes
[11:35:30] <jcrawford> what's the difference between the two suggestions? I notice one uses filter the other does not
[11:35:48] <t4nkd> lol, the keys are like, right next to eachother, no worries :)
[11:35:50] <Dave_Stein> jcrawford: I think using .filter is faster, but I'm not sure. I do recall using el:first is slower than el.first
[11:35:58] <jcrawford> thanks
[11:36:04] <Dave_Stein> imsky: do you know for sure?
[11:36:52] <imsky> Dave_Stein: http://jsfiddle.net/ATf9Y/
[11:37:32] <timmywil> $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked') will be fastest
[11:37:49] <timmywil> of the 3
[11:38:04] <Dave_Stein> timmywil so youre sure :checked will always beat .filter(':checked') ?
[11:38:39] <timmywil> yea, because it's valid qsa and filter uses matchesSelector, which is slower than qsa in webkit
[11:39:09] <timmywil> but :checkbox is not qsa, so type="checkbox" is faster
[11:39:13] <ohsnap> How can I select two elements at the same time? Like .something + .something children ?
[11:39:42] <ajpiano> ohsnap: $(".something").children().andSelf();
[11:39:48] <ajpiano> for that particular case
[11:40:03] <ohsnap> what's the .andSelf for?
[11:40:05] <yedimind> hey, has anyone run into a scenario where appendto + .tmpl() adds the same content several times on mobile platforms
[11:40:19] <ajpiano> in other things, basically just $(".any,.selectors,#separated,[name='byCommas']")
[11:40:19] <ajpiano> ?andSelf @ ohsnap
[11:40:21] <bot-t> ohsnap, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[11:40:21] <yedimind> works fine on the pc, but on mobile (with jquery mobile) adds the content
[11:40:29] <ohsnap> awesome
[11:40:48] <ohsnap> ie7 and ie8 are trying to drive me nuts
[11:41:03] <imsky> http://jsperf.com/checkboxes
[11:41:12] <imsky> Dave_Stein timmywil
[11:41:24] <ohsnap> Can I do something like $j('.destacado').children().andSelf().each(function(){ ...
[11:41:40] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi
[11:41:43] <timmywil> yea, tag will be even faster
[11:41:49] <timmywil> skips qsa
[11:41:54] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I'm trying to add an Editor button under each textarea that has class showEditor
[11:41:56] <Nicolas_Leonidas> http://jsfiddle.net/bYDPr/2/
[11:42:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> but I receive strange errors in fiddle.jshell.net :(
[11:42:13] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use spine.js or backbone.js?
[11:43:31] <Dave_Stein> imsky: damn it i was making one
[11:43:31] <Dave_Stein> haha
[11:43:39] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ProLoser|Work: those are  just body parts.js
[11:43:46] <imsky> Dave_Stein: too slow bro \:D/
[11:43:58] <timmywil> doesn't exclude radios, but that works
[11:44:01] <imsky> i use knee.js Nicolas_Leonidas
[11:44:12] <Dave_Stein> i never used jsperf before , just read ha
[11:44:15] <imsky> sometimes even foot.js
[11:44:28] <hacksparrow> Are Spine and Backbone Node frameworks?
[11:44:31] <imsky> no
[11:44:32] <Nicolas_Leonidas> imsky: I use something .js that I don't wanna mention here
[11:44:37] <hacksparrow> independent?
[11:44:38] <imsky> Nicolas_Leonidas: wat is it bro
[11:44:41] <ajpiano> no they're client side mvc frameworks
[11:44:42] <imsky> hacksparrow: yessir
[11:44:45] <ajpiano> they'll work in node as well
[11:44:52] <hacksparrow> I see
[11:44:55] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: i have  written a bunch of backbone
[11:45:03] <ajpiano> which is why i recommended it yesterday when you asked
[11:45:09] <hacksparrow> Which engine do they use? V8?
[11:45:15] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I'll tell you something funny, I was working on this website, it was for an animal shop, the name of their css file was dogystyle.css
[11:45:16] <ajpiano> hacksparrow: wat
[11:45:29] <imsky> hacksparrow: they don't use an engine, they're just js code, like jquery
[11:45:30] <hacksparrow> they must be using some JS engine right?
[11:45:40] <ajpiano> they're the same as jquery
[11:45:41] <hacksparrow> Clientside?
[11:45:43] <imsky> if u ax one moar time, u r troll
[11:45:55] <ajpiano> they use whatever engine is running in the browser that is running it
[11:46:04] <hacksparrow> Lol dude, no trolling. I though it was some serverside stuff.
[11:46:14] <jugstah> question.. is it possible for jquery to hide a link from a navbar if they go to a certain page?
[11:46:18] <hacksparrow> hahaha
[11:46:56] <imsky> jugstah: yes
[11:47:35] <ohsnap> anyone using ie8 that could take a look to small problem ?
[11:47:44] <imsky> this is the future room
[11:48:03] <Nicolas_Leonidas> can someone review this and tell me what I'm doing wrong here please? http://jsfiddle.net/bYDPr/3/
[11:48:05] <imsky> ie8 is the long gone past
[11:48:12] <ohsnap> i know :(
[11:48:21] <ohsnap> the past is bringing me problems to the future lol
[11:48:32] <ohsnap> I had to launch a virtual machine to check that stuff
[11:48:53] <imsky> Nicolas_Leonidas: http://jsfiddle.net/bYDPr/4/
[11:48:59] <imsky> 1.6.4 is being a huge bitch on jsfiddle
[11:49:03] <imsky> let's not use it ever
[11:49:27] <webe> How do I select an element by width?
[11:49:36] <webe> not munipulate
[11:49:41] <Nicolas_Leonidas> imsky: thank you
[11:49:41] <Dave_Stein> ?attr @ webe
[11:49:41] <imsky> webe: unless it's defined as an attribute, you can't do it very fast
[11:49:42] <bot-t> webe, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[11:49:43] <Dave_Stein> if it has that
[11:49:47] <ajpiano> webe: do you actually want to know how to do that, or do you want someone to tell you why that's a really bad idea
[11:50:00] <imsky> trolling is a art
[11:50:09] <Dave_Stein> imsky youre great at that art
[11:50:14] <imsky> wut
[11:50:24] <jugstah> imsky - any clues where to begin?
[11:50:26] <imsky> i've been beating you every time on help this past hour
[11:50:38] <Dave_Stein> its cause im working and helping
[11:50:39] <imsky> jugstah: yeah, do you have the page live?
[11:50:43] <Dave_Stein> :)
[11:50:47] <imsky> Dave_Stein: lol you don't think i'm working bro?
[11:50:53] <Dave_Stein> you never work
[11:50:57] <Dave_Stein> i've seen you not work plenty of times
[11:50:59] <jugstah> yes but Im on a NDA so I can't show it LOL!
[11:51:00] <imsky> false and homosexual
[11:51:04] <Dave_Stein> hahaha
[11:51:12] <aro> is there an unserialize function
[11:51:18] <imsky> jugstah: well ok...do you just want to REMOVE a link?
[11:51:20] <beakybal4> hi
[11:51:31] <beakybal4> ah dw
[11:51:31] <imsky> hi beakerman
[11:51:34] <Dave_Stein> whatever last answer was more of a tie considering i gave the function
[11:51:34] <imsky> shiii
[11:51:37] <imsky> hi beakybal4
[11:51:45] <imsky> Dave_Stein: bro you're not seriously competing with me are you
[11:51:50] <webe> .attr is for munipulation
[11:51:54] <webe> not selection
[11:52:01] <imsky> webe, wrong
[11:52:05] <ajpiano> webe:  $(".foo").filter(function() { return $(this).width() === 500; });
[11:52:09] <imsky> it's for tons of thangs
[11:52:10] <jugstah> yes, we have a link in the nav bar... that we want to "disappear" but only if they go to a certain section of the website.. dont ask me why.. these people want it and I'm not quite sure...
[11:52:15] <beakybal4> imsky: hey :0
[11:52:20] <beakybal4> imsky: :)
[11:52:21] <imsky> jugstah: why can't this be done serverside?
[11:52:24] <Dave_Stein> imsky: lol no im messing around
[11:52:26] <imsky> beakybal4: hii
[11:52:28] <jugstah> I'm thinking I'd have to name these pages a certain way and then use jquery to detect the page name and then disable the link from there?
[11:52:34] <Dave_Stein> imsky: im doing the backend for some billing reporting and its so boring my mind is melting
[11:52:41] <imsky> jugstah: nah. is the link always the same on every page?
[11:52:42] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ok, now, I need the content of the textarea to be alerted http://jsfiddle.net/bYDPr/6/
[11:52:49] <jugstah> imsky- well, its all templated.. so we're thinking doing via the jquery way may be more efficient??
[11:53:00] <Nicolas_Leonidas> but only the last one is, how do I make these objects on the fly and bind click events to them?
[11:53:01] <imsky> Dave_Stein: crud apps are 90% of what folks do
[11:53:16] <imsky> jugstah: ok where is this link in the page, and what's its URL
[11:53:22] <aro> does jquery have a way to break apart a GET string?
[11:53:26] <beakybal4> imsky: how's it going mate?
[11:53:34] <imsky> aro probably
[11:53:35] <jugstah> its the nav bar, its on every page
[11:53:39] <aro> 'key1=val1&key2=val2' etc
[11:53:40] <imsky> beakybal4: are you here to socialize bra
[11:53:40] <jugstah> sec
[11:53:48] <beakybal4> imsky: uhh a bit :)
[11:53:58] <Dave_Stein> aro: you should check out ba-bbq
[11:53:58] <imsky> beakybal4: you're not at work or school?
[11:54:11] <beakybal4> imsky: i'm from the UK, colege ended 6 hours ago :p
[11:54:13] <imsky> Dave_Stein: wat
[11:54:16] <beakybal4> *college
[11:54:18] <imsky> beakybal4: you sleazy git
[11:54:18] <Dave_Stein> imsky: yeah but ive gotten all the creating and reading, im just down to writing more searches like basedo n name
[11:54:20] <aro> babbq?
[11:54:25] <jugstah> imsky- suppose the page name starts with a 'sunset', i'd want to hide the 'partnership' link
[11:54:32] <beakybal4> imsky: mehehe :p
[11:54:36] <beakybal4> imsky: how about you?
[11:54:37] <imsky> aro, no don't listen to that garbage, just look into query string libraries for jquery
[11:54:39] <jugstah> i could add a 'class' if i have to
[11:54:45] <Dave_Stein> oh wai
[11:54:49] <Dave_Stein> ?param @ aro
[11:54:49] <bot-t> aro, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[11:54:51] <imsky> jugstah: you can add a class but you can't just straight up delete it?
[11:55:06] <Dave_Stein> ba-bbq has a deparam
[11:55:08] <imsky> Dave_Stein: that sounds pretty fun actually
[11:55:15] <imsky> Dave_Stein: that's like saying, get Windows for Notepad
[11:55:18] <jugstah> imsky- no because its all templated so we just want to add a code to a certain section of pages?
[11:55:26] <imsky> jugstah: you're tearing me apart lisa
[11:55:33] <Dave_Stein> imsky: it has a lot of other useful url goodies
[11:55:37] <imsky> ok so is the url always the same for the link? jugstah
[11:55:38] <jugstah> yeah i dont think this is gonna be easy at all
[11:55:48] <imsky> Dave_Stein: hush your mouf
[11:55:49] <jugstah> yeah if the pagename starts with sunset
[11:55:55] <jugstah> like sunset-resources.htm
[11:55:59] <jugstah> sunset-*.htm
[11:56:08] <jugstah> would all have to hide the 'partnership' link in the navbar
[11:56:11] <imsky> jugstah: ok and no other links have that
[11:56:21] <t4nkd> If I do some $('somedropdown').val('newValue') how do I trigger the .change for that select it as well?
[11:56:33] <imsky> t4nkd: $("select").trigger("change")
[11:56:41] <t4nkd> oh true enough :P
[11:56:44] <jugstah> well, there's a few pages under sunset-*.htm dropdown but these will need the partnership nav link hidden too
[11:56:59] <imsky> jugstah: ok so how can we reliably tell this link apart from others?
[11:57:08] <imsky> so that we know exactly that it's the one
[11:57:08] <jugstah> sunset-*.htm
[11:57:15] <jugstah> no other page will have sunset*
[11:57:19] <imsky> gotcha one sec
[11:57:29] <Dave_Stein> imsky: it's not fun since ive done this exact thing too many times in my life
[11:57:37] <imsky> Dave_Stein: build a framework
[11:57:42] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/eKz4N/   --> how do i get the 'add item' "button" to sit at the bottom of the <td>? right now it sits after the last element
[11:57:53] <swiggy> but i want it to sit on the very bottom, no matter what
[11:58:24] <aro> why does ben alman think hes a cowboy?
[11:58:24] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i have a service to get me all the data so im just adding new functions to the api to search on more things
[11:58:24] <imsky> beakybal4: i'm busy like a fox, welcome to #jquery
[11:58:32] <Dave_Stein> imsky: so its kinda a framework that will work on my other sites with same billing service
[11:58:42] <beakybal4> imsky heh, thanks :)
[11:58:43] <imsky> Dave_Stein: sounds like a good time, just get drunk and do it bro
[11:58:45] <Dave_Stein> he's a maverick
[11:58:54] <Dave_Stein> imsky: come to ny and work here
[11:58:57] <ajpiano> aro: it's been his nickname for like his entire adult life, there is no "why"
[11:59:07] <imsky> Dave_Stein: no offense but ny is kinda jank
[11:59:07] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/eKz4N/1/   -- i cleaned up the HTML a little bit
[11:59:19] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i prefer gritty
[11:59:21] <imsky> jugstah: is this link in a particular section of the site, like a DIV with an ID?
[11:59:26] <aro> i hate the yankees
[11:59:37] <imsky> Dave_Stein: yeah no, with the williamsburg hipsters and disney times square, the magic is long gone ;)
[11:59:44] <swiggy> the openDialogButton class is the one that needs "fixing" I want the items inside class="openDialogButton" to sit on the baseline/very bottom of the <td>
[11:59:53] <Nicolas_Leonidas> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7679090/jquery-add-buttons-under-elements-and-remember-which-element-the-button-belongs

[12:04:51] <imsky> though i don't recommend doing this with jquery if it's already not included in the page
[12:04:57] <imsky> use qwery or something else small
[12:05:19] <imsky> jugstah: you could also use ^= instead of *=
[12:06:35] <jugstah> imsky- thanks!! i will let you know how i make out.. i needed a direction to go into.. i appreciate it!
[12:06:43] <imsky> np bud, have fun :)

[12:11:12] <PineappleClock> is there a better way to find out the indice of $(this) in a parent's container than enumerating .parent() and using .is()

[12:11:54] <jugstah> imsky- i'll slow my roll re: sports :-)
[12:12:00] <imsky> lol you fanatic
[12:12:23] <t4nkd> How might I say, dropdown.val('some_foo') unless 'some_foo' has attribute disabled='disabled' ??
[12:12:38] <imsky> t4nkd: wat is dat
[12:12:50] <imsky> also i do believes you can't set val for disabled elements
[12:12:55] <t4nkd> You can still select an option of a form select with val
[12:12:57] <t4nkd> :(
[12:12:59] <Kambfhase> if you wanna make an if-statement without breaking the jquery chain there is a ben alman plugin for that!
[12:13:10] <imsky> there is a ben alman plugin for NOT that, too!
[12:13:13] <t4nkd> Yeah even if it's disabled you can set it using val()
[12:13:18] <t4nkd> Which I didn't want :P
[12:13:21] <imsky> t4nkd: so they finally figured it out eh
[12:13:37] <t4nkd> lol luckily /I/ tried this first
[12:13:56] <imsky> $(dropdown).filter(":enabled").val("crap")
[12:16:41] <t4nkd> still works :\
[12:16:43] <t4nkd> hrmm
[12:16:46] <jugstah> imsky- you rule.. it worked.. it disabled all teh dropdowns.. except for the main one but all dropdowns under it was disabled.. sweet
[12:16:47] <imsky> no way brone
[12:17:03] <imsky> jugstah: good to know man, celebrate \:D/
[12:17:10] <iroxoru> party time
[12:17:21] <jugstah> now that i have the code, i just need to work it and figure out how to hide the main nav link too
[12:17:23] <imsky> party time for reals (âï¾ã®ï¾)â
[12:17:44] <t4nkd> lol s'true .filter(':enabled').val('some_disabled_option') turns disabled_option selected :P
[12:17:51] <Kambfhase> <(^^,)>
[12:17:53] <jugstah> hmm, i could hide it based on the 'file name' of the image of the nav link
[12:17:55] <jugstah> that might work
[12:18:01] <imsky> t4nkd: oh you described the problem wrong
[12:18:05] <imsky> hold on bro
[12:18:08] <t4nkd> oh true
[12:18:09] <imsky> no wonder it works
[12:20:21] <mrconfused786> hello
[12:20:34] <mrconfused786> need help matching input id elements that look like this array_326450[module_quantity]
[12:20:42] <mrconfused786> where the 326450 can change.
[12:20:48] <mrconfused786> i need to find all elements that look like that.
[12:20:51] <mrconfused786> heres what i tried
[12:20:56] <imsky> ohh shit here it comes
[12:21:16] <mrconfused786>  $('input')
[12:21:17] <mrconfused786>          .filter(function() {
[12:21:19] <mrconfused786>                 return this.id.match("array_[0-9]*\[module_quantity\]");
[12:21:20] <mrconfused786>     }).alert("Matched!");
[12:21:36] <mrconfused786> but its obviously not matching.
[12:21:40] <t4nkd> Hold palm infront of face
[12:21:43] <t4nkd> Place face in palm
[12:21:45] <mrconfused786> okay holding
[12:21:45] <t4nkd> Shake head
[12:21:54] <mrconfused786> :-) yes i feel stupid.
[12:21:54] <Kambfhase> $.fn.alert=function(x){ throw "up";};
[12:22:34] <enjoycrf> all systems nominal
[12:22:47] <enjoycrf> 1 mor file to remove
[12:23:08] <mrconfused786> any thoughts on how to solve my dilema
[12:23:09] <mrconfused786>  ?
[12:23:21] <mrconfused786> really could use the help tried everything.
[12:24:01] <enjoycrf> wats up dood
[12:24:04] <Kambfhase> $('input').filter(function(){return /array_\d+\|foo\]/.test( this.id)})
[12:25:14] <webdev5> $(clickedUL).parent().find('img').attr('src', 'images/plus.png').hide();
[12:25:30] <webdev5> I want to find a particular image from the parent
[12:25:38] <webdev5> what is the correct way of doing that?
[12:25:49] <mrconfused786> Kambfhase what does the foo thing do ?
[12:25:55] <mrconfused786> and the test ?
[12:26:17] <Kambfhase> webdev5: $(clickedUL).parent().find('img[src="images/plus.png"]').hide();
[12:26:22] <Kambfhase> try that
[12:26:33] <webdev5> thank you Kambfhase
[12:26:44] <Kambfhase> replace foo with module_quantity
[12:27:57] <Kambfhase> "string".match( /regexp/) is slow. but /regexp/.test("string") is fast and returns a boolean, if the regexp matches, not some crappy object
[12:28:07] <Kambfhase> much more elegant
[12:28:14] <xp_prg> I have kind of a dumb question, can jquery talk to https seamlessly?
[12:28:44] <mrconfused786> Kambfhase I need to travser all input elements that match that regex
[12:28:55] <mrconfused786> and i tried what you said and still no match
[12:28:59] <mrconfused786> should it be this or $this.id
[12:29:07] <imsky> t4nkd: ok i got it
[12:29:12] <BarelyFitz> xp_prg: are you going from an https page to an https service?
[12:29:23] <t4nkd> imsky: king of the pimps
[12:29:26] <mrconfused786> $('input').filter(function(){return /array_\d+\|module_quantity\]/.test(this.id)});
[12:29:31] <Kambfhase> $('input').filter(function(){ return /array_\d+\[module_quantity\]/.test( this.id); })
[12:29:36] <imsky> t4nkd: http://jsfiddle.net/CwgBX/
[12:29:46] <imsky> time for u to use a plugin bro, fresh made
[12:29:59] <Kambfhase> there is a small typo in there, a pipe instead of a bracket
[12:30:04] <xp_prg> well I want to talk to https json and I am on the same server etc...
[12:30:14] <t4nkd> oh snap :D
[12:30:16] <imsky> how many of you like this: if($(this).is(":not(:disabled)")){
[12:30:18] <imsky> say YEEEEEE
[12:30:31] <xp_prg> will it decrypt the communication for me?
[12:30:54] <BarelyFitz> xp_prg: yes, you can do a service call to a json service via https. the browser will handle all encryption.
[12:31:29] <BarelyFitz> xp_prg: but if you are on an http page you cannot connect to an https service
[12:31:40] <here4thegear> there was a way that you could set ajax caching globally for all ajax calls. $.ajaxSetup({cache: false; }); can I use ajaxSetup to create a new property? I'm thinking I'd like to add a function that automatically pushes itself to an accessable variable... requests.push(this); so that I can do a global abort of all ajax requests
[12:31:46] <enjoycrf> i would just do if (!$this.attr(disabled)
[12:31:46] <t4nkd> yezzir
[12:32:02] <xp_prg> ok thanks
[12:32:32] <Swiv> Hey, question for the ThemeRoller on the jQueryUI website
[12:34:35] <xp_prg> ok another wierd question, lets say I want to make a json interface to a legacy system, I do a json call and I get html and I tuck the json in a div in the html, can I get that json, bypassing all the html etc... ?
[12:34:57] <xp_prg> my hunch is yes, just use a regex
[12:34:58] <here4thegear> eh, I can use $.ajaxStart(function(){}); for this I think
[12:35:17] <xp_prg> I was hoping there would be a better way
[12:35:19] <mrconfused786> I tried this and no alert was thrown
[12:35:20] <mrconfused786> $('input').filter(function(){ return /array_\d+\[module_quantity\]/.each(function(){ alert(this.id)})});
[12:35:23] <Dave_Stein> imsky: what's your twitter?
[12:35:35] <imsky> Dave_Stein: @imskyco
[12:35:46] <xp_prg> BarelyFitz is that true?
[12:35:54] <jugstah> im @jugstah but i rarely use twitter
[12:35:56] <jugstah> heh
[12:36:00] <imsky> same here
[12:36:07] <mrconfused786> Kambfhase can i do alert like that instead of the test
[12:36:09] <Kambfhase> $('input').filter(function(){ return /array_\d+\[module_quantity\]/;}).each(function(){ alert(this.id)});
[12:36:15] <jugstah> cuz all my llamahz non-techy friends are on facebook, i tend to use that more...
[12:36:21] <Dave_Stein> yeah 18 tweets but eh il still follow just in case that 19th is amazing

[12:38:22] <jugstah> wtf is behance?
[12:38:23] <imsky> interesting interesting

[12:38:31] <imsky> jugstah: deviantart for non-losers
[12:38:37] <mrconfused786> Kambfhase cool thanks alerts aare happening now but for every input field
[12:38:51] <jugstah> ooh, i love deviantart graphics they are good stuff
[12:38:53] <mrconfused786> its not matching on the ones that start with array_ and contain [module_quantity]
[12:38:58] <t4nkd> behance is like, dribbbbble for pro's
[12:39:06] <imsky> jugstah: yep, if someone's good on dA, good chance they're on behance
[12:39:17] <imsky> t4nkd: dribbble is dribbble for pros
[12:39:22] <jugstah> ahh
[12:39:40] <t4nkd> lawls, sorry I don't think dribbble is well curated, jm2c
[12:39:54] <jugstah> well, enough chit-chat, i must pretend to do some work
[12:39:57] <t4nkd> behance has a wider breth of media and artists
[12:39:59] <Kambfhase> mrconfused786: it machtes all tha start with array_ and have some random numbers in there
[12:40:00] <imsky> t4nkd: that's why i use rss
[12:40:08] <imsky> and follow tags
[12:40:25] <t4nkd> no I feel ya, I'm not saying it's a /bad/ place, lots of talent there
[12:40:35] <t4nkd> Just... a lot of kinda crap non-art too
[12:40:46] <t4nkd> But clearly that's just an opinion
[12:40:52] <imsky> lol don't worry about it bro
[12:40:54] <imsky> it's the internet
[12:41:00] <t4nkd> s'true
[12:41:05] <t4nkd> doin' it for the lulz
[12:41:16] <mrconfused786> Kambfhase nope. i confirmed that its matching against all of them.
[12:42:25] <Kambfhase> err, which do you want to be matched?
[12:42:52] <BarelyFitz> xp_prg: yeah, I suppose you could do that if you needed to. the ajax call is just returning text data, so you could find the json within, then parse it manually. kind of weird though.
[12:43:08] <xp_prg> I'm a weirdo :>
[12:43:25] <ohsnap> really no one with ie8 or ie9 here? I know they suck but I need to check what am i doing wrong :/
[12:43:43] <Pilate> using IE ;)
[12:44:03] <mrconfused786> I want it to match the whole string here's what i tried
[12:44:04] <mrconfused786> $('input').filter(function(){ return "/^array_\d+\[module_quantity\]$/";}).each(function(){ alert(this.id)});
[12:44:08] <ohsnap> Pilate: do you mind taking a look to an url?
[12:44:50] <mrconfused786> so it HAS TO start with array_ and it has to contain the string [module_qunatity] including the brackets and that string has to be followed by the numbers that are after array_
[12:45:07] <mrconfused786> so an example of a good match is :
[12:45:47] <mrconfused786> <input type="text" id="array_326450[module_quantity]">
[12:45:53] <mrconfused786> example of a bad match
[12:46:29] <cincinnatus> I'm trying to trigger a method after a .insertBefore() has finished, and load() isn't doing it for me
[12:46:31] <mrconfused786> <input type="text" id="array_326450[kw_dc_rating]">
[12:46:31] <Kambfhase> $('input').filter(function(){ return /array_\d+\[module_quantity\]/.test( this.id);}).each(function(){ alert(this.id)});
[12:46:39] <cincinnatus> is there anything that would be similar?
[12:47:41] <mrconfused786> it worked
[12:48:00] <Kambfhase> yay
[12:48:01] <mrconfused786> y did it work now and not before
[12:48:06] <imsky> magic
[12:48:07] <mrconfused786> it looks like the same thing ?
[12:49:04] <ohsnap> Pilate: Are you still around?
[12:50:04] <here4thegear> nope that won't work but... I'd like to do this if possible. $.ajax({ "CustomProperty": true, rest of request stuff }) and if that is in fact true, for each request... perform a function. is this possible?
[12:50:39] <ajpiano> here4thegear: use a prefilter
[12:50:45] <ajpiano> api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[12:51:16] <mrconfused786> Kambfhase as soon as i remove the .test function it causes it to not work
[12:51:30] <mrconfused786> i guess the test function is waht does the evaluation on the regex
[12:51:30] <Kambfhase> well, you better not remove it then.
[12:51:35] <mrconfused786> :-)
[12:51:47] <mrconfused786> just learning to see what it does
[12:52:31] <Kambfhase> while you're at it, learn javascript!
[12:54:37] <jq> I am trying to run a function after an image loads on a page. I currently do this by binding to the load function, but this does not get thrown when the image loads from cache (I think). Is there a better way to determine when the image is done loading?

[13:09:39] <BinaryKitten> your selector was wrong
[13:09:44] <BinaryKitten> also you don;t need to each
[13:09:56] <cambrian-re> Thank you BinaryKitten. Reviewing now.
[13:09:57] <enjoycrf> whoa dood ben alman is here
[13:10:08] <BinaryKitten> ben_alman is da man!
[13:10:08] <enjoycrf> wer is he
[13:10:15] <BinaryKitten> he al-man
[13:10:17] <enjoycrf> HAY beeen
[13:10:18] <BinaryKitten> :p
[13:10:23] <enjoycrf> HAY!
[13:12:00] <gnarf> cambrian-re: http://jsfiddle.net/gQJm4/
[13:12:22] <yedimind> is today ben alman day or something
[13:12:30] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: removeAttr( 'checked' ) isn't really correct in 1.6
[13:12:32] <eddiemonge> everyday is ben_alman_ day
[13:12:49] <gnarf> BinaryKitten / cambrian-re: .prop( 'checked', false ) would be preferred...
[13:12:50] <enjoycrf> hay wer is he
[13:12:55] <enjoycrf> i thot he wuz here
[13:13:23] <BinaryKitten> gnarf it would? why?
[13:13:38] <zoned> added a line to my css file... firebug 'net' tab shows the 'response' from the css file, and it includes this line. firebug 'css' tab however, does not have this line. nor is the element styled on the page. already cleared my cache. same exact problem in chrome. wtf?
[13:15:26] <cambrian-re> The reason I was doing remove attribute is older browsers think checked: (Anything) is true, so the entire attribute has to be removed for it to work.
[13:15:35] <enjoycrf> haha i jus made a crop of a cats nose lol

[13:29:58] <Gates>   $htm = file_get_contents($url);
[13:30:03] <Gates> and echo teh html
[13:30:03] <enjoycrf> yeah
[13:30:08] <enjoycrf> yep
[13:30:12] <Gates> and then wen it calls that file it will be the same!
[13:30:20] <Gates> hmm
[13:30:21] <eddiemonge> cambrian-re: you should have it. its technically required
[13:30:25] <enjoycrf> yayaya
[13:30:30] <enjoycrf> wheeeeeeee
[13:30:33] <cambrian-re> Done. Thank you.
[13:30:45] <enjoycrf> but i do hav tiem to make lolz on here tho hahaha
[13:30:54] <enjoycrf> all the time in the world
[13:30:59] <enjoycrf> to make lolz
[13:31:07] <Gates> that hurts ;)
[13:31:19] <cambrian-re> I'm suprised it worked... I guess jQuery isn't very picky.
[13:31:53] <Brodingo> how jaqury formed
[13:33:21] <Wilto> Brodingo: Well, when two websites love each other very muchâ¦
[13:33:28] <enjoycrf> coagulation
[13:33:44] <enjoycrf> physics
[13:33:52] <Wilto> Tons of physics, yeah.
[13:34:06] <Brodingo> when two domains love each other they match their ports and exchange scripts
[13:34:30] <Wilto> Now youâre getting it.
[13:34:47] <enjoycrf> in a vacum 2 objects will always draw to one another
[13:34:55] <rocktop> anyidea?
[13:34:59] <johnernaut> anyone know of an awesome hosted calendar solution?
[13:35:09] <Brodingo> johnernaut google.com
[13:35:31] <johnernaut> Brodingo: google.com returns trash services, hence why I'm seeking an opinion
[13:36:13] <Gates> can i do like url: ././file/php
[13:36:17] <Gates> .php
[13:36:29] <Kambfhase> yes
[13:36:45] <Kambfhase> you can even do
[13:36:48] <pifantastic> Gates: ../../file.php
[13:36:54] <Kambfhase> not, that you'd want to do that thoguh
[13:37:24] <enjoycrf> omg if i was any cleaner i would be nothing
[13:37:26] <Gates> fucking cms have like nested shit and idk where the files suppose to sit :|
[13:37:44] <pifantastic> Gates: what CMS?
[13:38:00] <enjoycrf> gates find . -type f -exec grep -irls 'stuff to find' {} \;
[13:38:10] <Gates> wordpress
[13:38:20] <Gates> its like in .com/asdf/asdf/page/
[13:38:25] <enjoycrf> my friend made wordpress
[13:38:28] <Gates> but hte file is in com/file.php
[13:38:46] <enjoycrf> thats called SEF
[13:38:54] <Gates> eh
[13:38:55] <Brodingo> hi my name is forward slash and i make your urls relative
[13:39:01] <enjoycrf> that url gets rewiten by apache
[13:39:26] <enjoycrf> $1 $2 $3
[13:39:38] <kborchers> that's like $6
[13:39:39] <enjoycrf> &id=$1
[13:39:41] <enjoycrf> and so on
[13:40:58] <enjoycrf> welcome to the real world neo
[13:41:06] <enjoycrf> ill be morfeus
[13:41:20] <enjoycrf> i told u im beyond spelling
[13:42:05] <Gates> yo enjoycrf
[13:42:22] <Gates> if its a checkbox do i need a 'submit' button or can i just do onclick
[13:42:25] <Gates> i was using onClick="this.form.submit();
[13:42:31] <Gates> but it refreshs the page, i dont want it to refresh
[13:42:54] <enjoycrf> then ya
[13:43:08] <Gates> return false wont work =[
[13:43:17] <kadiks> hi, could someone tells me why this work with "...createElement( 'div');" and not with "...createElement( 'script');" > full code : http://pastebin.com/XjVFpfXr
[13:43:33] <enjoycrf> u have to make a function
[13:43:46] <enjoycrf> put that function to onlick
[13:44:04] <enjoycrf> in that function go
[13:44:05] <Kambfhase> thou shall not add a wrong type to your <script>
[13:44:08] <Gates> what
[13:44:51] <enjoycrf> ar params = $("#order_form").serialize();
[13:45:00] <enjoycrf> var params = $("#order_form").serialize();
[13:45:01] <ScottO_> all of a sudden my append(html) is now replacing instead of appending and im not sue why
[13:45:24] <enjoycrf> w this method u dont submit anything
[13:45:33] <enjoycrf> but rather collect the form data
[13:45:37] <kadiks> Kambfhase, but I put "text/javascript", what's wrong with that ?
[13:45:38] <BinaryKitten> kadiks you are switching back and forth between jquery
[13:45:39] <BinaryKitten> and not
[13:45:48] <BinaryKitten> you should stick to one or the other
[13:46:27] <Nicolas_Leonidas> C:\Yasser\Html Projects
[13:46:35] <Nicolas_Leonidas> sorry, now you all know my real name
[13:46:49] <Nicolas_Leonidas> what I meant to say was http://jsfiddle.net/k6FZz/2/
[13:46:51] <kadiks> there's just the document.createElement to make it faster than a string, except from that it is all jQuery
[13:46:56] <miceiken> hi yasser
[13:46:59] <webe_> I'm trying to append one element to another by using a selector that grabs the inline style. Can someone help me with this?
[13:47:00] <Gates> is it the functoion with this.form.submit(); return false
[13:47:07] <kadiks> and still, it does work with 'div' so it is not the problem
[13:47:08] <Nicolas_Leonidas> what does this error message mean "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'cloneNode'" ?
[13:47:08] <Gates> or something else cause that isnt working and still does it :|
[13:47:15] <Nicolas_Leonidas> miceiken: haha
[13:47:18] <Kambfhase> kadiks: javascript is not text, it's code. therefore the correct mimetype is application/javascript
[13:47:21] <BinaryKitten> kadiks http://pastebin.com/kEd4GZz3
[13:47:33] <ScottO_> nm my stupidity
[13:47:38] <Gates> actaully the form never needs to submit :|
[13:47:40] <ScottO_> gotta love Selenium IDE tho :P
[13:48:22] <enjoycrf> no
[13:48:27] <enjoycrf> yes
[13:48:38] <enjoycrf> make a function
[13:48:51] <enjoycrf> bind click to that finction
[13:48:54] <kadiks> oh thx a lot Kambfhase you're right. It was the first time I was doing dynamic loading so I didn't know thanks
[13:49:03] <enjoycrf> in that function place the code a gave u
[13:49:08] <enjoycrf> and do
[13:49:11] <kadiks> thanks BinaryKitten, but it was the type attribute
[13:49:13] <enjoycrf> alert(params);
[13:49:46] <BinaryKitten> kadiks sure but still you shouldn't mix stuff like that
[13:49:51] <BinaryKitten> stick to one or the other
[13:50:27] <kadiks> BinaryKitten, I saw a benchmark and using document.createElement is much faster
[13:50:43] <oojacoboo> any ideas on why this mouseenter/leave isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/m9Zzy/5/
[13:50:51] <BinaryKitten> how old was the benchmark kadiks?
[13:51:13] <BinaryKitten> because i don't think there is that much difference especially when passing it to jquery after
[13:51:20] <kadiks> not that old as it included IE9
[13:51:37] <BinaryKitten> it's not that you're using createElement over straight jquery
[13:51:41] <BinaryKitten> it's that you're mixing the two
[13:51:54] <kadiks> the benchmark was doing exactly the same
[13:52:02] <kadiks> let me find the link
[13:52:06] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: there really isn't much harm if you know what you're doing
[13:52:06] <jbalint_> hi
[13:52:45] <oojacoboo> here, I updated the html someâ¦ http://jsfiddle.net/m9Zzy/6/
[13:52:47] <Dave_Stein> i didn't catch the beginning, but id ef call document.createElement at times
[13:52:54] <jbalint_> is there any reason a selector would be different in a filter()? im not matching the elements i expect to: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3224348/select-bgimg.PNG
[13:53:30] <BinaryKitten> kadiks http://pastebin.com/H4RrGmYc
[13:53:51] <kadiks> BinaryKitten > http://jsbin.com/elula3
[13:54:08] <Kambfhase> oojacoboo: works if you choose 'onDomReady'
[13:54:14] <alvesjnr> hi all
[13:54:31] <oojacoboo> ah ok
[13:54:33] <enjoycrf> my app is down to 1.4M
[13:54:38] <kadiks> anyway, I don't really care BinaryKitten, you're right, I should even do it without jQuery
[13:54:50] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ it should be a[style*=back] - no quote
[13:54:54] <Dave_Stein> jablint_ i believe
[13:54:55] <BinaryKitten> :)
[13:55:09] <oojacoboo> Kambfhase: if I am modifying the DOM this shouldn't affect this right?
[13:55:14] <BinaryKitten> its the mix, you lose all speed benefits as soon as you muddy the water :)
[13:55:26] <alvesjnr> First of all, hello everybody. I'm not a web developper, I'm a biologist, but I have to do something in javascript for my thesis
[13:55:41] <kadiks> see the benchmark link and prove me otherwise
[13:55:49] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: no that doesnt change anything, and would be inconsistent with the other selectors that function as expected
[13:55:58] <Dave_Stein> kadiks: what are you guys debating?
[13:56:10] <enjoycrf> sory they hav u doing js in biology man
[13:56:18] <enjoycrf> i think bio is way more important
[13:56:25] <kadiks> about this Dave_Stein > var scriptTag = $( document.createElement( 'script' ) );
[13:56:30] <Kambfhase> $("<yeast>").is("eukaryote") //true
[13:56:38] <kadiks> the mix of jQuery and js
[13:56:46] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ alvesjnr
[13:56:46] <bot-t> alvesjnr, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:56:47] <alvesjnr> I have a webpage with some text fields, and I want to change all text fields with the content 'something' to ''
[13:57:00] <gnarf> kadiks: micro optimizing?
[13:57:12] <gnarf> $( "<script>" ) is way easier to type, and not THAT much slower
[13:57:25] <gnarf> at least i hope not significantly
[13:57:30] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ hold on im gonna jsfiddle
[13:57:54] <Kambfhase> simple tags got fast pathed in 1.4
[13:57:55] <Dave_Stein> kadiks: anytime i need to add an element and basically just put an id / HTML inside, i go native
[13:58:06] <Dave_Stein> kadiks: well not anytime- anytime i need to optimize speed
[13:58:07] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: let me know if i should simplify it
[13:58:20] <kadiks> right gnarf, but  I don't really mind, I came for a code not working, now it does, so I will have to end that discussion guys :-)
[13:58:26] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: you can run that directly on the page chromocyte.com/educate in chrome's console if you want
[13:58:47] <Gates> whats wrong with this
[13:58:48] <Gates>                 $('.success').fadeIn(200).show();
[13:58:48] <Gates>                 $('.success').delay(500).fadeOut(200).hide();
[13:58:55] <kadiks> don't know enough JS to hold the debate
[13:58:59] <Dave_Stein> wtf jsfiddle is giving me a JS error when i try to run anyone else gettin that?
[13:59:04] <Gates> i wanna do a 'fadein' and then a hide fadeout after a delay
[13:59:17] <Gates> :|
[13:59:25] <ajpiano> Gates: you should just do it all in one chain
[13:59:40] <alvesjnr> how can I select an element by the type?
[13:59:45] <ajpiano> $('.success').fadeIn(200).show().delay(500).fadeOut(200).hide();
[13:59:50] <ajpiano> Gates: see ?delay2
[13:59:51] <bot-t> Gates, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[14:00:00] <Gates> ahh
[14:00:05] <ajpiano> .delay only works on queues, so just use it on the chain and it should queue properly
[14:00:06] <Gates> thnx ajpiano
[14:00:38] <gnarf> why .fadeIn().show() ???
[14:00:47] <ajpiano> lol true dat
[14:00:47] <gnarf> .fadeIn( time ) should do the show
[14:00:59] <gnarf> and .fadeOut( time ) should do the hide
[14:01:34] <gnarf> Gates: ^^^
[14:01:37] <cambrian-re> alvesjnr:  Ex of selecting by type $('[type="radio"]')
[14:01:53] <BinaryKitten> kadiks  here's your proof http://jsbin.com/elula3/20/edit
[14:02:11] <Gates> gnarf: idk
[14:02:13] <Gates> im a noob
[14:02:15] <gnarf> cambrian-re / alvesjnr: make sure to use class or tagname or something else as well... that attr selector is slowish without something else to filter on
[14:02:16] <Gates> does it do such a thing?
[14:02:21] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ hrmmm why isnt this working?! haha
[14:02:23] <gnarf> ?tias @Gates
[14:02:24] <bot-t> Gates, Try It And See
[14:02:31] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: :\
[14:02:45] <gnarf> elem.fadeIn( 200 ).delay( 500 ).fadeOut( 200 ) should totally work
[14:02:52] <kadiks> before I test it BinaryKitten, you're right, simply because you believe more in it. And thx for your time
[14:02:58] <gnarf> the .show() and .hide() are confusing it
[14:03:08] <gnarf> specially since you didn't pass a duration
[14:03:12] <BinaryKitten> gah you asked for me to prove it kadiks
[14:03:26] <BinaryKitten> i wouldn't have even bothered if you hadn't asked me to
[14:03:38] <gnarf> elem.fadeIn( 200 ).show().delay( 500 ).fadeOut( 200 ).hide(); <--- this last .hide() is hiding the thing while its fading in
[14:03:44] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_: this works $('a[target=advert][style*="background-image"]')
[14:03:45] * BinaryKitten mumbles and grumbles
[14:03:54] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: yes, i know that works
[14:03:58] <kadiks> BinaryKitten, I see the d3 faster that the others
[14:04:02] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: but the filter() doesnt
[14:04:25] <BinaryKitten> kadiks i'm getting jquery wrap @ 453, and no jquery @ 232
[14:04:26] <kadiks> than d1 & d2
[14:04:29] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: um
[14:04:31] <BinaryKitten> yep agreed
[14:04:33] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: why not jsperf?
[14:04:44] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: and it works if i do this: $("a[target='Advert'][style]").filter(function() { return $(this).attr("style").indexOf("background") != -1; })   but for some reason the selector in the filter is screwy
[14:04:48] <BinaryKitten> gnarf it was kadiks
[14:04:52] <kadiks> ok and that is what I did and say
[14:04:54] <BinaryKitten> i just added the additional
[14:04:54] <alvesjnr> cambrian-re: thanks man
[14:05:19] <gnarf> oh - jsperf way more accurate
[14:05:22] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ it seems buggy
[14:05:25] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target=advert]').filter('[style*=b]') works
[14:05:28] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target=advert]').filter('[style*=ba]') does not
[14:05:34] <alvesjnr> gnarf: thanks too, I'll look for that
[14:05:41] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: what do you think about that?
[14:05:47] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: the quotes in attribute selectors are preferred fyi
[14:05:54] <ajpiano> cc @ jbalint_
[14:06:00] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target=advert]').filter('[style*="ba"]') no work
[14:06:01] <cambrian-re> alvesjnr:  This will also help with what you are doing: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[14:06:04] <kadiks> if you're trying to prove me that plain js is faster than jQuery, there was no need for that, it's no brainer
[14:06:06] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target=advert]').filter('[style*="b"]') works
[14:06:14] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: hrm, i see. :(
[14:06:40] <kadiks> except from that, my solution is the quickest, so I don't see what you were saying
[14:06:40] <enjoycrf> my ifone looks like the terminator
[14:06:50] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: thoughts?
[14:06:57] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: for goodness sake
[14:07:07] <ajpiano> can you PLEASE stop aimlessly babbling into this channel as it suits your fancy
[14:07:36] <gnarf> kadiks: http://jsperf.com/creating-elements-test
[14:07:40] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: techncailly, they're not preferred - they're required
[14:07:41] <enjoycrf> okAy gAh
[14:08:03] <gnarf> what are you trying to do?
[14:08:14] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I don't get this jquery error "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'cloneNode'" , it's happening here http://jsfiddle.net/k6FZz/2/
[14:09:00] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i did put quotes after you corrected me
[14:09:20] <ajpiano> they should be in the first selector too :p
[14:09:34] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano fine ill do that but i bet it still sucks :P
[14:09:36] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: what are you trying to do?
[14:09:47] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target="advert"]').filter('[style*="b"]') works
[14:09:54] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target="advert"]').filter('[style*="ba"]') does not work
[14:09:56] <Dave_Stein> there - all quoted up
[14:10:06] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ is trying to do , im just looking into it
[14:10:14] <kadiks> gnarf, let's resume, in my code I put the 3rd solution, BinaryKitten told me that was no good. I try to justify quickly by saying that it was quicker than adding the tag as a string, and finally, in all the benchmark, it proves me right
[14:10:20] <Dave_Stein> gnarf ajpiano: if you take that [style] out of filter and put it into first selector, it works
[14:10:28] <kadiks> I think I don't understand english anymore :-)
[14:10:29] <Dave_Stein> $('a[target="advert"][style*="ba"]') works
[14:10:33] <ajpiano> that is bizarre
[14:10:38] <Dave_Stein> so it's weird that filter is saying eff off
[14:10:43] <gnarf> kadiks: its not about performance 9 percent of the time
[14:10:50] <BinaryKitten> kadiks, i didn't say it was no good for the reason you said
[14:10:51] <Dave_Stein> so it looks like jbalint_ did find something wrong
[14:10:58] <Kambfhase> Nicolas_Leonidas: update your jQ version.
[14:11:00] <BinaryKitten> i said it was not good to mix it all about.
[14:11:17] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: fiddle?
[14:11:25] <BinaryKitten> there is little point in getting really fast code if it gets confusing what you are doing
[14:11:26] <kadiks> but it works, no ?
[14:12:06] <Nicolas_Leonidas> Kambfhase: version 1.6.4, same thing http://jsfiddle.net/k6FZz/4/
[14:12:08] * BinaryKitten is out of this aguement
[14:12:17] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: fiddle was throwing a JS error when i just tried to one sech elping cowowker then fiddle
[14:12:35] <realpap> http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/3/ is there an easy way to ad jquery animation to that menus? im new to jquery
[14:12:38] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: http://jsfiddle.net/5H2Gh/
[14:12:49] <ajpiano> Nicolas_Leonidas: do you know how to use a stack trace
[14:12:57] <gnarf> both seem to work for me
[14:13:03] <kadiks> BinaryKitten, I don't really mind as it is not based on performance, so to please you and end the debate I'll put a full jQury code (my goal was to make it work, no more, no less) ^^
[14:13:07] <kadiks> thanks again
[14:13:07] <Kambfhase> Nicolas_Leonidas: you still load the old version in your html
[14:13:42] <gnarf> i was just showing you jsperf
[14:13:50] <gnarf> cuz writing 1000 loops is silly when we have jsperf
[14:13:52] <Nicolas_Leonidas> Kambfhase: good point, removed that , still the same http://jsfiddle.net/k6FZz/5/
[14:14:01] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ double check your markup ha
[14:14:05] <Dave_Stein> gnarf has a working fiddle
[14:14:10] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: no, would love to learn though, you do that in chrome element inspector?
[14:14:17] <ajpiano> Nicolas_Leonidas: yeah
[14:14:30] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: maybe its been fixed, i have 1.4.4 on that site, fiddle is 1.7pre
[14:14:31] <kadiks> I just took a working benchmark example, I didn't make it ^^
[14:14:37] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: what do you specifically mean by stack trace, you just put break points and stuff?
[14:14:38] <gnarf> jbalint_: 1.4?????
[14:14:46] <gnarf> get 1.5 at least... 1.6 preferably
[14:14:59] <ajpiano> no i mean using hte stack trace to find what part of your code is connected to the deep lib code where it's breaking
[14:15:16] <ajpiano> Nicolas_Leonidas: basically, in chrome dev tools - in the scripts panel... there's a little "pause" button in the bototm right
[14:15:18] <gnarf> jbalint_: with http://jsfiddle.net/5H2Gh/2/ - i still get both console.logs to output the <a>
[14:15:22] <ajpiano> you can click that until it turns purple
[14:15:25] <gnarf> at least in crome
[14:15:31] <ajpiano> and then chrome will stop when you hit an exception
[14:15:38] <ajpiano> then the "Call Stack" will be full of functions
[14:15:51] <gnarf> ?ftj
[14:15:52] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:15:55] <ajpiano> and you can click through them to see what is the calling code, the "stack" of functions that led to being inside of where it is
[14:15:55] <gnarf> ;)
[14:16:10] <ajpiano> gnarf: the section on using stack trace isn't that detailed, the author of that sucks
[14:16:11] <ajpiano> :p
[14:16:20] <gnarf> ajpiano: bitch him out!
[14:16:21] <gnarf> :)
[14:16:24] <gnarf> bbl - gotta run
[14:16:33] <ajpiano> Nicolas_Leonidas: you can also use .map here
[14:16:38] <jbalint_> gnarf: hrm, thanks.
[14:16:44] <realpap> http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/3/ i did that menus in css, is there a way to add animation to the hovers with jquery?
[14:17:43] <ajpiano> var elems = $("#foo .bar").map(function() { return {item: index}; }).get().sort(function(a, b) { return a.value - b.value });
[14:17:47] <jbalint_> gnarf: how do you show the output in that fiddle with the old jquery?
[14:17:55] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: I probably need to study that a bit more, do you have a tutorial link or something I could use?
[14:18:01] <Brodingo> realpap you could do it in css
[14:18:17] <ajpiano> ?g when to use jquery's map methods ajpiano
[14:18:18] <bot-t> ajpiano, When To Use jQuery's .map Methods - http://ajpiano.com/2010/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[14:19:29] <realpap> brodingo it works on every browser? (i dont care for ie6)
[14:19:54] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: will read that, but everything works perfectly before I call quicksand, I mean the sorting and everything else works I'm just trying to improve the look
[14:20:28] <Brodingo> realpap could work in browsers with css transition support and fall back
[14:20:30] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: nice choice of variable names pee, poo
[14:21:02] <ajpiano> thank you
[14:23:28] <Poopy> Quick question - what JQuery function can I use to fill in a radio button upon an event?
[14:23:36] <ajpiano> Nicolas_Leonidas: from the docs it looks like the second arg to quicksand is supposed to be a jquery object
[14:23:38] <BinaryKitten> fill in?
[14:23:45] <ajpiano> not a regular array of objects which is what you're passing
[14:23:46] <BinaryKitten> you mean set it to be checked?
[14:23:50] <ajpiano> that's why "cloneNode" is undefined
[14:23:57] <Poopy> BinaryKitten: exactly
[14:24:25] <BinaryKitten> Poopy well you might want to set it's PROPerty or its ATTRibute for checked

[14:24:48] <BinaryKitten> lmfao
[14:24:53] <oojacoboo> ha
[14:24:55] <Brodingo> brt
[14:25:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hang the spammers
[14:25:17] <BinaryKitten> nah
[14:25:23] <BinaryKitten> just remove their fingers..
[14:25:42] <Nicolas_Leonidas> they'll use voice recognition software
[14:26:03] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: I'm checking that
[14:26:29] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: this is the example I'm using http://razorjack.net/quicksand/demos/one-set-clone.html
[14:26:34] <ajpiano> i have an idea
[14:27:00] <Nicolas_Leonidas> the second parameter is not a jquery object, it's just some options
[14:27:38] <Nosferatu> hi all. I am trying to debug a page, and have found that the trigger('click') event is not functioning the same as actually clicking the link. Is there a way to better emulate an actual mouseclick?
[14:27:41] <ajpiano> the first one, whatever
[14:27:45] <ajpiano> you're passing this array
[14:27:45] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ i disappeared, but just so you know gnarf had that fiddle and it still workedo n 1.4.4
[14:27:50] <ajpiano> that doesn't make any sense
[14:27:58] <Nosferatu> it is on a href, btw
[14:28:26] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: yes, interesting that it doesnt in my setup :|
[14:31:07] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: in the example on the site it's an array too, but I just noticed the elements are of  HTMLIELEMENT type
[14:31:12] <ajpiano> yup
[14:31:23] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use backbone or spine?
[14:31:44] <Nicolas_Leonidas> while mine is just an arary
[14:31:52] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: how many times a day are you going to be asking htat
[14:32:14] <ProLoser|Work> until i get a response
[14:32:17] <ProLoser|Work> #spinejs is empty :(
[14:32:29] <ProLoser|Work> and i'm having some difficulty understanding how to go about structuring my code to leverage those techs
[14:32:58] <ProLoser|Work> like i've read the documentation, blog posts and tutorials over and over, but i'm not sure i fully understand how to collectively structure my files (aka: put the classes together)
[14:33:03] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: http://weblog.bocoup.com/organizing-your-backbone-js-application-with-modules
[14:33:17] <ajpiano> luckily that post just was published 3 hours ago!
[14:33:19] <ProLoser|Work> do you prefer backbone over spine?
[14:33:23] <ajpiano> yes
[14:33:44] <ProLoser|Work> why is that? i have qualms with the _.js dependency and need something lite
[14:33:47] <realpap> i just finished this http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/3/ is there a way to animate it with jquery without touching the css?
[14:34:09] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: holy crap that's exactly what i was asking lol
[14:34:11] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: it's *absurd* to say that backbone and underscore is "heavy"
[14:34:33] <ajpiano> spine is like, ok, i'm gonna take those ideas, shave off 1-2k and act like i changed the world
[14:34:33] <ProLoser|Work> not heavy, just that i have an existing app i wish to port, and a very limited timeline,
[14:34:59] <ProLoser|Work> i want to be able to fight with less, but i'm skeptical about the lack of community behind one vs the other
[14:34:59] <ajpiano> timeline != library kilobyte counting
[14:35:20] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: we were supposed to have someone do a spine.js talk at jqcon this weekend
[14:35:27] <ajpiano> and he ended up just doing "what is mvc in the browser" instead
[14:35:28] <Woet> ajpiano: do you by any chance know which site i'm looking for?
[14:35:35] <Woet> it had a lot of javascript/css3 effects
[14:35:45] <Woet> colorful, recently introduced 3d effects, made by someone russian/east europe
[14:35:46] <yedimind> css3please.com ?
[14:35:55] <Woet> nope
[14:35:56] <yedimind> oh, then not that
[14:35:57] <ProLoser|Work> what a vague ass question
[14:36:06] <Woet> ProLoser|Work: i know
[14:36:08] <Woet> that's the problem
[14:36:11] <ajpiano> not quite ringing a bell
[14:36:13] <Woet> else i would had found it 2 weeks ago :p
[14:36:13] <yedimind> there are only several trillion sites on the web, it cant be hard to narrow down
[14:36:21] <Woet> :(
[14:36:25] <Woet> it was mentioned here was
[14:36:31] <Woet> i already searched my irc logs for http://
[14:36:33] <Woet> which was a pain
[14:36:40] <Woet> in this channel
[14:36:41] <ProLoser|Work> Woet: be more specific, a site that USES js/css, a site that teaches it? a tool for generating it? a framework for expediting it? what are you talking about?
[14:36:42] <yedimind> ha
[14:36:56] <Woet> ProLoser|Work: a person who made a plugin for jquery
[14:36:56] <ajpiano> i don't think he was being all that vague
[14:36:59] <yedimind> sounds like a library of fun javascript/css3-driven demos
[14:37:08] <ajpiano> he said "recently released css demos site"
[14:37:10] <Woet> a site that hosted the demo of all effects
[14:37:10] <ProLoser|Work> Woet: that converts query animations to css3 transitions?
[14:37:16] <dschuett> how is searchform possibly not defined??? http://pastie.org/private/o5zihv1xrhrudadunu6xw
[14:37:17] <Woet> no, that adds a lot of unique animations
[14:37:18] <ProLoser|Work> *jquery
[14:37:19] <AlainJacomet> I need to change the look of a select tag into some square color buttons selector. Does anyone know how to do this ?
[14:37:31] <Woet> i'm not sure of too many details since i had to leave right after seeing the site
[14:37:34] <Woet> hence i didnt bookmark it
[14:37:35] <ProLoser|Work> Woet: give an example of a 'unique' animation
[14:37:36] <Woet> thats the problem :p
[14:37:38] <yedimind> is it a gallery or what
[14:37:45] <yedimind> animation of what
[14:37:49] <Woet> ProLoser|Work: let me find it, hard to explain
[14:37:52] <ProLoser|Work> ...
[14:37:55] <ProLoser|Work> totally vague
[14:38:00] <yedimind> if we sit here for you to find it, we'll be here another 2 weeks
[14:38:00] <yedimind> :)
[14:38:03] <ProLoser|Work> i know of 39 stupid drop shadow effects
[14:38:07] <Woet> i know it's vague, that's why i cant find it ProLoser|Work :p
[14:38:13] <Woet> 1 moment
[14:38:14] <ProLoser|Work> i know mothereffinghsl
[14:39:03] <Woet> one of the effects was like turning a rubik's cube
[14:39:05] <Woet> to flip an image
[14:39:12] <Woet> that's all i can remember to be honest :p
[14:39:15] <yedimind> OH I KNOW THAT ONE
[14:39:16] <ajpiano> dschuett: since when is "name='foo'" supposed to magically generate a global var
[14:39:22] <Woet> honestly, yedimind?
[14:39:25] <yedimind> nope
[14:39:29] <yedimind> lol sorry i couldnt resist
[14:39:30] <Woet> meany
[14:39:32] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ajpiano: thanks for your help
[14:40:03] <Woet> the domain it was hosted at was like colouricious.com
[14:40:09] <Woet> hm
[14:40:18] <ProLoser|Work> http://webdesignerwall.com/trends/47-amazing-css3-animation-demos
[14:40:21] <Woet> already browsed millions of 'top XX css effects'
[14:40:30] <Woet> let me check that one too, ProLoser|Work
[14:40:32] <Woet> pretty sure i went through it
[14:40:36] <yedimind> Woet, http://inspectelement.com/demos/css3/3dgallery/
[14:40:52] <Woet> nope, the site was very colorful
[14:41:04] <Woet> random colors all over your screen
[14:41:06] <dschuett> ajpiano: works fine here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8HoVdenZFM
[14:41:20] <Woet> none of those, ProLoser|Work
[14:41:30] <Woet> i know it's a long shot asking here, but im sure someone in this channel pasted it here once
[14:41:36] <Woet> so if that person could just speak up :p
[14:41:40] <ajpiano> dschuett: if you watched a tutorial from last year where they're still teaching you to use onclick and document.forms shit like this
[14:41:43] <ProLoser|Work> Woet: next year, when you find the site, feel free to link me to it
[14:41:45] <ajpiano> as part of a jquery application
[14:41:50] <ajpiano> you're watching a really shitty tutorial
[14:41:53] <Woet> that's only a few months away ProLoser|Work!
[14:42:14] <yedimind> Woet, would it be one of these: http://webdesignerwall.com/trends/47-amazing-css3-animation-demos ?
[14:42:16] <ProLoser|Work> then finding that website is closer than you thought!
[14:42:23] <Dave_Stein> gnarf imsky ajpiano: this just in, we are looking to hire a front end dev who loves the shit out of CSS - know anyone in nyc that fits that?
[14:42:28] <yedimind> or http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/50-awesome-css3-animations/
[14:42:42] * BinaryKitten remembers dealing with document.forms error where someone named their form "forms" and wondered why it broke
[14:42:47] <yedimind> which, on closer inspection, seems to be like the same goddamn list
[14:43:07] <xp_prg> doesn't jquery ui depend on jquery proper?
[14:43:11] <xp_prg> or is it self contained?
[14:43:30] <ajpiano> xp_prg: yes
[14:43:41] <ajpiano> dschuett: you should be using jquery's bind
[14:43:42] <Woet> nope, unfortunately not yedimind
[14:43:44] <xp_prg> so you can use jquery-ui by itself?
[14:43:47] <ajpiano> and jquery selectors
[14:44:18] <ajpiano> xp_prg: yes, it requires jquery itself.
[14:45:56] <P33t> Hi Folks. Need a little advice here. I got saddled with setting up a landing page with a form which is supposed to show a "Thank you. Your msg has been submitted" msg in a lighbox after the form is submitted. Has anyone seen this or knows of a site that does this or a tutorial out there?
[14:48:30] <xp_prg> thanks piano man
[14:48:57] <BinaryKitten> lol
[14:49:10] * BinaryKitten has that song in her head now
[14:49:19] <BinaryKitten> but with ajpiano singing it
[14:49:56] <P33t> no one?
[14:50:03] * xp_prg hugs BinaryKitten but in a platonic, neo-conservative, fiscally conservative, pro free market economy way
[14:50:18] <ajpiano> P33t: is the form being submitted via ajax?
[14:50:18] <BinaryKitten> lmfao
[14:50:38] <realpap> i just finished this http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/3/ is there a way to animate it with jquery without touching the css?
[14:51:25] <ajpiano> realpap: you mean, use jquery to do an animation that doesn't affect the style attribute?
[14:51:28] <P33t> No, just a standard form. I saw the tut over at nettuts for using ajax to submit.
[14:51:47] <realpap> no
[14:51:48] <ajpiano> P33t: form submission takes you to another page, there is no "after' event for a standard form submission
[14:52:07] <ajpiano> P33t: if you want to use a standard form, you can put something in the URL
[14:52:11] <ajpiano> that you post to
[14:52:12] <P33t> This posts to eloqua
[14:52:13] <realpap> i dunno ajpiano
[14:52:14] <ajpiano> and then look for that in jquery
[14:52:23] <oojacoboo> is it .ajax().done().fail()?
[14:52:29] <oojacoboo> or do you have to setup a new deferred?
[14:52:35] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: yes
[14:52:40] <oojacoboo> which one?
[14:52:42] <ajpiano> you don't need a separate deferred
[14:52:43] <realpap> i just did it in css because i tought after i was done it was simple to animate it in jquery
[14:52:46] <oojacoboo> ok
[14:52:52] <realpap> i just want to add a slide animation
[14:53:04] <oojacoboo> can't get it to work, was working with success: and error:
[14:53:25] <ajpiano> realpap: use slideDown ?
[14:53:31] <realpap> but how
[14:53:43] <ajpiano> you'll have to modify the CSS
[14:53:49] <realpap> ok ill do it
[14:53:50] <ajpiano> so that it doesn't just work on the :hover
[14:54:08] <realpap> i remove the hovers from the css?
[14:54:38] <ajpiano> google is your firend
[14:54:46] <realpap> ok thanks
[14:54:51] <ajpiano> http://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&ix=c2&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+slide+down+menu
[14:55:12] <realpap> its just that achieving that in css was hard lol
[14:55:19] <P33t> Basically, in the action attribute of the form it points to eloqua, which captures leads, then from there, it can either spit out a redirect or do nothing so I would need to have the data go there and launch the lightbox.
[14:55:34] <ajpiano> realpap: unfortunately we're not here to discuss your resource allocation and sunk costs :)
[14:56:02] <ajpiano> P33t: you control the url it redirects to?
[14:56:11] <P33t> not really.
[14:56:22] <P33t> same url for each form generated from them.
[14:56:27] <ajpiano> P33t: do you know how to make a lightbox normally?
[14:56:44] <P33t> havent tried it yet.
[14:56:48] <ajpiano> to present an arbitrary message?
[14:56:48] <ajpiano> ok
[14:56:55] <ajpiano> that's your problem, you're coupling together two tasks
[14:57:05] <ajpiano> first, figure out how to make the lightbox when the page loads
[14:57:24] <ajpiano> then... figure out the part where you make it conditional based on some property that you expect to be in the URL after the form post
[14:57:28] <P33t> the form isnt in the lightbox though
[14:57:33] <ajpiano> i realise that
[14:57:36] <realpap> ok piano thanks
[14:58:26] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: are the arguments from an ajax request passed to .done()?
[14:58:39] <ajpiano> they should be, yes
[14:59:59] <realpap> http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/5/ ok now i have that but it doesnt works :D
[15:00:15] <juha_> anyone worked with jquery ui datepicker on dynamically loaded inputs?
[15:02:38] <ajpiano> realpap: including jQuery in the fiddle usually helps http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/6/
[15:02:44] <ajpiano> also probably would be tweaking the css you hvae there
[15:03:27] <realpap> lollllllll
[15:03:48] <BarelyFitz> I thought Mootools and jquery had same syntax and features. weird.
[15:03:51] <ajpiano> i think you and i have different opinions of what is lolzy
[15:04:29] <realpap> dont get mad ajpiano
[15:05:23] <talntid> Anyone here want to implement jquery UI into my existing calendar project? :)
[15:05:30] <talntid> paid, of course.
[15:06:01] <realpap> its looks like jquery is in conflict with css
[15:09:13] <dschuett> could someone help me understand why i'm not getting anything back from my .post? http://pastie.org/private/l5c9d3wnkleg1vkgg0g
[15:11:22] <BarelyFitz> dschuett: you probably shouldn't use a click event on a submit button. instead use a submit event on the form.
[15:11:47] <BarelyFitz> if I had to guess, when you click "go" that would just reload the current page
[15:12:02] <realpap> piano
[15:12:17] <dschuett> BarelyFitz: why would it reload?
[15:12:25] <dschuett> because that actually seems like what is happening
[15:12:27] <realpap> .main-menu li:hover ul, .main-menu li li:hover ul{left: auto;}  <<< that was making the css only code work
[15:12:36] <realpap> but if i remove it, the jquery stops working
[15:12:39] <ajpiano> dschuett: you're not actually suppressing the normal submit behaviour
[15:13:07] <dschuett> ajpiano: how do i get around that?
[15:13:18] <BarelyFitz> dschuett: when you click submit, it submits the form. the form has no action attribute, so the action is the current url.
[15:13:21] <ajpiano> that's why you want to do $("#yourForm").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $.post(....);  });
[15:13:47] <ajpiano> dschuett: when dealing with forms, you want to deal with the form submission event, not the fact that the user has interacted with a button that causes the submit to happen
[15:13:48] <AlainJacomet> jQuery('#colorselector a.lime').click(function() { jQuery('#color option[text=lime-green]').attr("selected", true);	}); <- how do I fix that ?
[15:14:01] <AlainJacomet> option[text=lime-green] is obviously wrong..
[15:14:49] <ajpiano> AlainJacomet: $("#color option").filter(function() {  return $(this).text() == "lime-green"; })
[15:14:56] <ajpiano> AlainJacomet: the right way to set a select's value
[15:15:07] <ajpiano> is to do $("#color").val("lime-green")
[15:15:14] <ajpiano> assuming ther's an option value="lime-green");
[15:15:35] <elplatt> question: does anyone know how to make a jquery datepicker replace a text field instead of popping up when the field is focused?
[15:16:03] <AlainJacomet> ajpiano:  thanks
[15:17:17] <thatryan> i have a div that fades in on page land like an 'into' but need to skip it if someone click 'hom' from inside the website, how can i do that?
[15:17:18] <mrconfused786> hello
[15:18:41] <mrconfused786> how do i get the value out of id="array_330607[name]" ? Here is what I know... The field name is stored in: var fieldName = "array_" + $(this).attr('array_id') + "[name]";
[15:18:43] <BarelyFitz> thatryan: maybe check to see if document.referrer is coming from your domain
[15:19:00] <mrconfused786> so the contetns of fieldName = array_330607[name]
[15:19:11] <mrconfused786> but when i do this var fieldValue = $('#'+fieldName).val();
[15:19:13] <mrconfused786> it doesn't work
[15:19:30] <mrconfused786> I guess Jquery doesn't handle [ ] well in the name (or id) of an input element ?
[15:19:44] <thatryan> BarelyFitz: thanks, how would i do that?
[15:20:04] <bot-t> mrconfused786, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[15:20:06] <mrconfused786> so how do i get that field value other than doing a string replacement on the fieldName and then adding 3 \\\ backslashes for each bracket ?
[15:20:53] <BarelyFitz> thatryan: if (document.referrer.indexOf(location.hostName) == -1) { /* do the intro */ }
[15:21:35] <BarelyFitz> "hostname" in lowercase that is
[15:22:16] <karstenk1977_> good morning
[15:22:23] <aro> good evening
[15:22:23] <mrconfused786> thanks mr bot-t
[15:22:24] <bot-t> mrconfused786, I'm a bot you know..
[15:22:29] <mrconfused786> i know
[15:22:33] <AlainJacomet> how do I change a select value and trigger the .change event ?
[15:22:37] <aro> hi mr bot-t
[15:22:38] <bot-t> Hey aro
[15:24:17] <realpap> please piano i cant figure it out http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/6/ this line makes the hover work on css .main-menu li:hover ul, .main-menu li li:hover ul{ left: auto;} but if i remove it css and jquery dropdown stops working, i have to edit it?
[15:24:50] <ajpiano> realpap: word to the wise
[15:25:00] <ajpiano> when you want to get someone's attention on irc, type their nickname
[15:25:07] <ajpiano> not a substring of it
[15:25:12] <thatryan> not their instrument?
[15:25:13] <thatryan> ;)
[15:25:18] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: what if i want to make an app with backbone/spine but it's not a 1-page app?
[15:25:28] <ProLoser|Work> like how would you delegate executing the page init code for different pages?
[15:25:48] <domino14> when i do $("#cancelBtn").click( â¦ ) does #cancelBtn have to exist at that time?
[15:25:51] <ProLoser|Work> the other problem i have is i'm not sure i see the merit of having models of likeâ¦ EVERYTHING. we have a backend that does a lot of work
[15:26:00] <domino14> what happens if i delete the #cancelBtn, and create another one with the same name?
[15:26:03] <thatryan> BarelyFitz: thanks, trying stuff with that now
[15:26:17] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: my advice would be for you to try out an actual backbone app
[15:26:19] <karstenk1977_> sometimes ago i think i saw a jquery plugin, which could make div floating in columns fit in with there text
[15:26:32] <ajpiano> client side mvc is something that you just sprinkle over an existing app
[15:26:34] <karstenk1977_> can somebody help and tell me the name or a link?
[15:26:52] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: theoretically it could be as simple as just like, including differnt scripts on different pages
[15:27:07] <ajpiano> but yeah, the assumption of Backbone is that it's largely for singlepage apps
[15:27:22] <ajpiano> or at least apps where you don't do a traditional page nav that often
[15:27:26] <ProLoser|Work> that's why i was considering spine, i don't want to fight with backbone when i don't need it
[15:27:39] <domino14> i have a horrifying mass of spaghetti code in front of me, can someone backbone it for me in a week?
[15:27:40] <ajpiano> not sure how spine solves that
[15:27:52] <ProLoser|Work> meh okay
[15:27:58] <ProLoser|Work> well here's the thing, we HAVE an existing app
[15:28:13] <ProLoser|Work> but the organization isâ¦ wellâ¦. non-existent and a huge unruly mess
[15:28:26] <ProLoser|Work> so this week was intended for refactoring and i wanted to leverage an mvc structure
[15:28:30] <ajpiano> lol
[15:28:40] <domino14> if i could refactor this in a week i'd be the man
[15:28:54] <ajpiano> refactoring your production application in 1 week to use backbone is not really going to end in success
[15:28:54] <realpap> ajpiano: i cant figure it out http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/6/ this line makes the hover work on css .main-menu li:hover ul, .main-menu li li:hover ul{ left: auto;} but if i remove it css and jquery dropdown stops working, i have to edit it?
[15:29:12] <ProLoser|Work> i already tried implementing my own home-grown mvc structure that at the very minimum separated binds into the view and json/ajax into the model, with all the initialization calls in the controller
[15:29:18] <domino14> probably a month, huh
[15:29:26] <ProLoser|Work> :/
[15:29:28] <ProLoser|Work> damn
[15:29:30] <AlainJacomet> how do you add an element AFTER some element ?
[15:29:34] <domino14> .append
[15:29:41] <ajpiano> realpap: i don't know man, debug, sorry
[15:29:42] <Kambfhase> .after()
[15:29:44] <AlainJacomet> doesn't that add it inside ?
[15:29:48] <karstenk1977_> sometimes ago i think i saw a jquery plugin, which could make div floating in columns fit in with there text
[15:29:51] <realpap> ok
[15:29:54] <AlainJacomet> Kambfhase: thank you
[15:30:07] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: and if 'this week' means "by the end of tomrrow" you clearly aren't going to just like, magicalyl throw spine or backbone at it
[15:30:16] <ProLoser|Work> lol
[15:30:19] <ProLoser|Work> well given a full week
[15:30:21] <ajpiano> and all problems solved
[15:30:26] <ProLoser|Work> including working nonstop over the weekend
[15:30:33] <domino14> if you were to code all 168 hours maybe
[15:30:35] <ProLoser|Work> with 3 devs on an app that was only prototyped and demod
[15:30:38] <dschuett> ajpiano: ok, i got it working with what you suggested, however now i can't return my mysql results http://pastie.org/private/zgggjinj86yvkk871qffw
[15:30:47] <ProLoser|Work> i thought it could at least get most of it converted
[15:30:51] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: it's fallacious to assume that you can just learn a framework on the fly and wedge it into an app that's mission critical
[15:31:06] <ProLoser|Work> so what do you suggest
[15:31:14] <ajpiano> backbone/spine is a way of thinking about the app, and you need to have a sandbox to learn how that feels and what you do
[15:31:28] <ajpiano> that means rethinking your client code from the ground up, not "what can i get away with"
[15:31:28] <ProLoser|Work> i suppose i could go back and start implementing spine/backbone functionality into my existing structure as i originally intended
[15:31:32] <domino14> kludge it together more until it becomes an unmanageable mess and/or you get acquired
[15:31:37] <ajpiano> i'm with domino14
[15:31:45] <ProLoser|Work> lol
[15:31:47] <ProLoser|Work> fine
[15:32:04] <karstenk1977_> hello?
[15:32:04] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: or ask for a month or 6 weeks to refactor
[15:32:12] <ProLoser|Work> i'll keep going in my current structure then and start implementing what i've picked up what i've studied from bone and spine
[15:32:12] <DyeA> this could be asked in js too but you brains will solve it in milliseconds
[15:32:13] <DyeA> http://jsfiddle.net/DyeA/g5zfB/
[15:32:15] <dschuett> why would "i is null: i get: j=c.makeArray(i.childNodes)}if(j.nodeT...-?weight|opacity|zoom|line-?height/i,"
[15:32:17] <ajpiano> spend the first week wrtiing a test app to learn how the framework works
[15:32:22] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[15:32:24] <ajpiano> and then think about how that applies to your app
[15:32:36] <DyeA> I lose the reference to my function which is inside an anon function
[15:32:50] <DyeA> How should I address the issue?
[15:33:17] <Kambfhase> use a script loader
[15:33:18] <ajpiano> and then plan your development from there
[15:33:40] <DyeA> Kambfhase: is the too me?
[15:34:02] <Kambfhase> yep
[15:34:13] <DyeA> script loader? like google load?
[15:34:32] <DyeA> why, is there a callback functionality in that?
[15:34:56] <DyeA> i.e. google.load("jquery", "1");
[15:35:05] <Kambfhase> pick one: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqln2akPWiMIdERkY3J2OXdOUVJDTkNSQ2ZsV3hoWVE#gid=0
[15:35:13] <Kambfhase> und use a callback on load, btw.
[15:35:52] <DyeA> this is written to be a bookmarklet, I don't have a load event
[15:36:00] <DyeA> sorry, should have mentioned that
[15:36:10] <ajpiano> DyeA: http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/
[15:36:52] <realpap> could someone please help me with this: http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/6/, this line makes the hover work on css>>> .main-menu li:hover ul, .main-menu li li:hover ul{ left: auto;}, but if i remove it css AND jquery dropdown stop working
[15:37:04] <DyeA> ajpiano: ok, thanks I will take a look at that
[15:40:23] <karstenk1977_> I have a lot of diffrent size div with ol and want to sort them in a column magazine style. I think i saw a plugin but i canÂ´t remember site or name. any idea?

[15:58:30] <ProLoser|Work> is there a utility for having one object/class extend another or 'mixing' another i guess?
[15:59:01] <ProLoser|Work> i don't care about mixins right now but i need to do extending so i can have like an app-wide object with functionality that all objects inherit
[15:59:16] <ajpiano> jQuery.extend?
[15:59:48] <ProLoser|Work> so i do $.(childObject, parentObject); ???
[16:00:00] <ProLoser|Work> doesn't this mean that i must declare both objects initially and then extend afterwards?
[16:00:11] <ProLoser|Work> or can i put the extend at the beginning and then build onto the child object?
[16:02:07] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: the first argument is the thing that's extended, yes
[16:02:16] <ajpiano> typically you end up with something like
[16:02:36] <ajpiano> $.extend( {}, parentObject, {other: "properties"} );
[16:02:58] <ajpiano> that's more if you're merging objects together into a new object
[16:03:08] <ProLoser|Work> so i'd do childObject = $.extend({}, parentObject, {new properties}); and then start building onto childObject?
[16:04:00] <ajpiano> the thing to note is that the properties are updated in the order the arguments appear, so if args 1 and 2 have the same key defined, #2's value for that key will take precendence
[16:04:23] <ajpiano> well, you can build childObject in the extend by passing the properties you're extending on as the last argument
[16:04:45] <ProLoser|Work> bind childObject in the extend?
[16:04:54] <ProLoser|Work> god i'm so confused and frustrated lol
[16:04:55] <ajpiano> what is there to bind?
[16:05:05] <ProLoser|Work> by bind i just mean build out it's functionality
[16:05:09] <ajpiano> yes
[16:05:20] <ProLoser|Work> you know when you have like new Person = Model.extend()
[16:05:27] <ajpiano> yah
[16:05:28] <ProLoser|Work> maybe i should try to leverage pieces of backbone
[16:05:41] <ProLoser|Work> and then immediately after you customize the Person, right?
[16:05:51] <ajpiano> no...
[16:05:56] <ajpiano> it's the same thing as i described
[16:05:56] <ProLoser|Work> i keep going back and forth every time i look at the code, it's giving me a headache
[16:06:03] <ajpiano> you pass the modifying properties in to the extend
[16:06:23] <ProLoser|Work> okay so almost the entire definition of what makes Person unique goes into the final argument of extend()
[16:06:59] <ajpiano> new Person = Backbone.Model.extend({ defaults: { firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith" }, getName: function() { return this.get("firstName") + this.get("lastName");  } })
[16:07:00] <ajpiano> yes
[16:07:21] <ajpiano> and then all those properties live on Person.prototype
[16:08:03] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[16:08:24] <ajpiano> so you can modify it after the extend as well, but you have to mutate the prototype
[16:08:44] <ProLoser|Work> with backbone, in the view i have render(), which then returns the final product of el populated with the unique template, but when do iâ¦ explicitly call 'render' and then push it to the view?
[16:09:02] <ProLoser|Work> does a view bind to existing dom and just manipulate it, or does it create and insert the dom from nothing?
[16:09:21] <ajpiano> it will create the outermost element from nothing, by default as a div
[16:09:33] <ajpiano> there are like screencasts and stuff you can watch about backbone
[16:09:35] <ajpiano> :)
[16:09:45] <ProLoser|Work> so when the page initially loads, like with all my default snippets/modules/views/whatever how do i just put together the layout?
[16:09:58] <ProLoser|Work> i'm just trying to get answers to a few specific questions
[16:10:03] <ProLoser|Work> your article helped me with structure however
[16:10:03] <ajpiano> when you render it is somewhat dependent on the exact flow of your app and how those particular models and views work
[16:10:49] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: you can also take an element that's already in the DOM and make it into a view, that's what i do a lot
[16:10:59] <ProLoser|Work> i made this yesterday as a sandbox conversion of one of my existing apps to spine http://jsfiddle.net/WTpZ3/
[16:11:02] <ajpiano> so like if there's just a place holder div in your thing
[16:11:28] <ProLoser|Work> ya i have a lot of placeholders
[16:11:36] <ProLoser|Work> my layouts (full pages) have a lot of js includes
[16:11:46] <ProLoser|Work> which then contain my view-specific templates, etc
[16:11:48] <ajpiano> and you want to make that into some view, you can do new FooView({ el: $("#foo")[0] })
[16:11:52] <ajpiano> and render it in the intialize method
[16:12:36] <ajpiano> and then that's how you get the render method to take an existing element in the dom and fill it
[16:13:42] <ProLoser|Work> here is an example of a layout and one of the snippet html files, and a version of my js using spine i attempted to make http://jsfiddle.net/WTpZ3/1/
[16:14:30] <ProLoser|Work> originally in my code, all includes are automatically loaded, and then once that is done i fire a callback which then renders the templates into the container divs
[16:14:58] <ProLoser|Work> i am trying to figure out how to go about doing THIS in backbone
[16:15:01] <ProLoser|Work> or spine, whatever
[16:16:15] <ProLoser|Work> actually this one would make more sense, since it's supposed to go along with the js http://jsfiddle.net/WTpZ3/2/
[16:16:43] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: i guess my real question is, inside render() do i specify WHERE to append this dom to?
[16:16:55] <ProLoser|Work> or do i call render() from elsewhere and then append/insert it where i see fit?
[16:17:21] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: no... render is where you manipulate the inner contents of the view
[16:17:29] <ajpiano> you can attach the element in initialize
[16:17:46] <ajpiano> or if you're starting from elements that are already in the dom, there's nothing to append it to
[16:17:48] <ajpiano> it's already there
[16:18:26] <ProLoser|Work> but that would mean that any manipulations to el would be slow right? cuz if i insert into el, i'm actually modifying the dom, it doesn't cache it until render is returned does it?
[16:18:50] <ProLoser|Work> by dom i'm referring to the live, on-page dom
[16:19:17] <ajpiano> you'd only be touching it once, theoretically
[16:19:22] <ajpiano> cause most render methods basically look like
[16:19:23] <Kamakazi> So I have a modal that pops up with a contact form, is there a way that I can keep the tabindex to be relative to the modal instead of switching to background elements?
[16:19:27] <xp_prg> is the concept of global variables existing in jquery/javascript?
[16:19:37] <ajpiano> $(this.el).html( someTemplate(someData) ); return this;
[16:19:48] <ajpiano> xp_prg: yes
[16:19:48] <coldhead> xp_prg: yes but it's not a good idea
[16:20:00] <xp_prg> how does it work?
[16:20:06] <coldhead> window.this_is_global = true;
[16:20:11] <ProLoser|Work> but if i were to do $(this.el).append(template1).append(template2); it WOULD be 2 hits right?
[16:20:41] <xp_prg> hmm... ok
[16:20:48] <ProLoser|Work> i think if i want to use backbone, i would need to create a way to choose what views are initialized and which ones are not
[16:20:50] <xp_prg> is window always defined or do I have to get it?
[16:21:01] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: yes, it would
[16:21:20] <ProLoser|Work> were you referring to the initialize of the view?
[16:21:21] <ajpiano> but the idea that you should be sitting there avoiding reflows like a maniac
[16:21:29] <ajpiano> when there are probably wayyyyyyyyy worse inefficiences in your code
[16:21:33] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[16:21:36] <ProLoser|Work> i understand
[16:21:39] <ProLoser|Work> premature, etc
[16:21:41] <ajpiano> is kind of like... having the cart and the horse in different countries
[16:22:18] <coldhead> xp_prg: window is always there
[16:22:27] <ProLoser|Work> in my existing structure, 'snippets' are chunks of page html and associated logic (usually bindings) that are interchangeably used on different pages, like modular widgets
[16:22:46] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[16:23:29] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: like i said, i'm skeptical you're just going to be able to glomp these two systems together
[16:23:38] <ajpiano> the point of refactoring is to make things less complicated, not more :p
[16:23:40] <ProLoser|Work> although these occasionally share a 'model' or data backend. Some layouts use a different combination of different widgets in different orders
[16:23:46] <xp_prg> colhead I heart you in a semi-platonic fiscally loose kind of way
[16:24:20] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: i was going to just keep up my own scheme, but i would have to recreate a heap of crap provided by backbone
[16:25:02] <dschuett> i can't return my mysql results http://pastie.org/private/zgggjinj86yvkk871qffw
[16:25:02] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: i think i have to ask, at this point... if you aren't just listening to one of my favourite records of 2010
[16:25:12] <ProLoser|Work> i was looking at building my own lazy loader, extendings, factory, validation, auto-binding, etc
[16:25:14] <ajpiano> the radio dept's "Clinging to a Scheme"
[16:25:19] <ProLoser|Work> it just feels like chaos
[16:25:53] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not trying to stick to anything
[16:25:55] <ProLoser|Work> i just don't have a month
[16:26:19] <ProLoser|Work> i have currently a clusterfuck of code that i want to rewrite
[16:26:24] <ProLoser|Work> and i have a week to do that
[16:26:36] <xp_prg> coldhead I am confused, I do windows.data = data; I then try to see it in my javascript console in firebug with alert(window.data); it says undefined
[16:26:43] <ProLoser|Work> then in one month i have to deliver the next revision of our product
[16:26:46] <xp_prg> what am I doing wrong my young jedi friend?
[16:26:58] <coldhead> i am terribly old, young man
[16:27:06] <ProLoser|Work> xp_prg: window.data
[16:27:07] <coldhead> you are doing it right
[16:27:08] <ProLoser|Work> not windows.data
[16:27:12] <coldhead> oh lol
[16:27:16] <coldhead> thanks ProLoser
[16:27:20] <coldhead> i shutup now
[16:27:26] <xp_prg> it is actually window.data in my code
[16:27:27] <ProLoser|Work> that's my guess anyway
[16:27:32] <xp_prg> I did do it right
[16:27:41] <ProLoser|Work> bin some code?
[16:29:05] <xp_prg> well its just a $function() { $.ajax(succss: function(data) { window.data = data
[16:29:16] <xp_prg> I confirm that the data is there and that it is working
[16:29:35] <xp_prg> but in my javascipt firebug console it says it is undefined hurting my tender feelings
[16:30:20] <smplstk> xp_prg: are you logging outside the ajax call?
[16:30:33] <smplstk> cuz like, scope brah
[16:30:53] <xp_prg> window is a global variable I was told
[16:31:02] <xp_prg> that is the whole point, I want to use the variable in my javascript console
[16:31:02] <smplstk> ya
[16:31:12] <smplstk> but like, you're setting it inside an ajax call
[16:31:24] <xp_prg> so, why does that matter?
[16:31:45] <smplstk> the a in ajax is an important concept to grasp...
[16:32:58] <smplstk> ?ajax101 @ xp_prg
[16:32:59] <bot-t> xp_prg, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[16:33:20] <xp_prg> the ajax function is getting called though *sigh*
[16:33:23] <xp_prg> I know how ajax works
[16:33:39] <smplstk> can I see some code?
[16:33:46] <xp_prg> I already put some in
[16:33:50] <coldhead> but it doesn't happen immediately, xp_prg
[16:33:51] <xp_prg> anyway I will figure it out
[16:34:02] <xp_prg> I know I make it happen then try to use the variable
[16:34:17] <coldhead> you might be like "k ajax, do this thing for me in your own time" and then you go "TELL ME THE RESULT NOW"
[16:34:23] <coldhead> and it's still doing its thing
[16:34:32] <coldhead> and hurting your tender feelings
[16:34:57] <smplstk> xp_prg: where's your code at?
[16:35:03] <xp_prg> on a computer
[16:35:37] <domino14> lol
[16:36:54] <smplstk> xp_prg: paste the code somewhere and I can help you debug
[16:37:02] <smplstk> ?p @ xp_prg
[16:37:02] <bot-t> xp_prg, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:37:43] <xp_prg> ya I confirm it is being set, the javascript console can't see it how crazy
[16:38:09] <smplstk> how do you "confirm" if you can't console.log?
[16:38:19] <xp_prg> smplstk here is the code:  $(function() { window.test2 = '2'; });
[16:38:33] <xp_prg> cuz I do an alert just before I close my $(function()
[16:38:44] <xp_prg> I do alert(window.test2);
[16:38:49] <xp_prg> it shows 2
[16:39:08] <xp_prg> but in my javascript console I try alert(window.test2); and it says undefined
[16:39:53] <smplstk> oh, well... is that variable getting set again with that ajax call you had previously?
[16:40:09] <xp_prg> no, this is massively simpified now
[16:40:19] <xp_prg> just want to see if the javascript firebug console can see any of my variables
[16:40:30] <xp_prg> it appears it can't see window variables turning me into its bitch
[16:41:24] <dschuett> anyone know why i'm getting this error: "o is null on Line 4" when trying to return results from mysql?    http://pastie.org/private/zgggjinj86yvkk871qffw
[16:42:28] <melvinram> Anyone know the status of the jQ UI Grid?
[16:43:27] <ajpiano> melvinram: still in development :)
[16:44:27] <ajpiano> melvinram: you can follow along on github here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/grid
[16:44:40] <ajpiano> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid as wel - i'd say we're like, in between stage 3 and 4 right now
[16:45:53] <melvinram> ajpiano: any idea when it might be ready for testing?
[16:46:23] <ajpiano> melvinram: depends what you mean by testing :)
[16:46:25] <xp_prg> I figured it out, I am no longer a bitch, you have to set a breakpoint then you can work with the data that is defined
[16:46:34] <ajpiano> you can definitely kick the tires on parts of it, like here: http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/
[16:46:40] <ajpiano> checking out the grid-editing and spf stuff
[16:47:14] <ajpiano> if by "testing" you mean "can i write a production app on top of it, and plan to report bugs if they turn up" probably not :)
[16:51:27] <xp_prg> your condescending elitist tone of voice will no longer disarm me during code reviews
[16:51:42] <bobdobbs> how do I only run a script when a particular page is loaded? I have assigned a unique ID to the body element of each page.
[16:52:38] <ajpiano> bobdobbs: ideally by only including it on the particular page :)
[16:52:51] <bobdobbs> hi aj :)
[16:53:25] <Elephant> if I inside of $('img#clone').click(function() {<here>});, $(this) or something of the like would be a way to refer back to the object clicked?
[16:53:33] <ajpiano> bobdobbs: if not... do something like if (  $(document.body).is("#foo") ) {} or one of a million other varieties of the same thought
[16:53:34] <Elephant> like to get another css property.
[16:53:52] <ajpiano> Elephant: yes, this or function(e) { $(e.target) }
[16:53:55] <bobdobbs> ajpiano: thanks
[16:54:00] <Elephant> perfect
[16:54:02] <Elephant> thanks
[16:54:42] <bobdobbs> I think the latter solution suits my case a bit better. I'd prefer to load as few scripts across the site as possbile
[16:54:48] <ajpiano> lol
[16:54:58] <ajpiano> i think you and i have different conceptions of "loading as few scripts as possible"
[16:55:08] <ajpiano> including a script on a page when it isn't necessary
[16:55:22] <ajpiano> and then having logic within it to conditionally execute it
[16:55:28] <bobdobbs> hmm
[16:55:28] <ajpiano> is not "loading as few scripts as possible"
[16:56:04] <bobdobbs> well, it reduces http requests. And if the target pages is loaded later, the script may already be cached
[16:56:33] <ajpiano> how does having an http request that doesn't need to happen in the first place reduce http requests
[16:56:55] <bobdobbs> heh
[16:56:56] <bobdobbs> true
[16:57:39] <bobdobbs> well, it does mean that if the target page is loaded second, it doesn't have to have any more http requests then any page loaded previously.
[16:58:17] <ajpiano> so by loading it in on a page where you don't need it, you then don't need to load it on a page when you do need it
[16:58:34] <ajpiano> i think the ludicrous aspects of that are fairly clear :p
[16:58:41] <bobdobbs> hmm.
[16:58:43] <ajpiano> but i can see the other side of that
[16:58:48] <ajpiano> kinda :p
[17:00:13] <bobdobbs> It made sense to me when I thought of it first.
[17:01:26] <bobdobbs> I also think that having a global script makes it easier to manage.
[17:02:15] <ajpiano> it's good to just code from your gut
[17:02:16] <ajpiano> like that
[17:02:17] <ajpiano> :p
[17:04:19] <CuDi> YO YO YO
[17:04:22] <CuDi> this your main man cudi
[17:04:24] <CuDi> in the buildin
[17:04:26] <CuDi> wassup wit it yall
[17:04:36] <pl0sh> hey guys, is there any jquery/jquery-ui plugin to change the look and feel of a <Select> drop down?
[17:04:40] <ProLoser|Work> is there sub(), create(), setup(), and init() in backbone?
[17:04:43] <CuDi> heaps
[17:04:47] <ProLoser|Work> i'm totally confused which ones are intended to be used where
[17:04:49] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: no the methods are different
[17:05:14] <ProLoser|Work> so fucking confused
[17:05:15] <ajpiano> pl0sh: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[17:05:20] <ajpiano> there is one being worked on for jqueryui
[17:05:28] <ProLoser|Work> every example on the internet is completely different from every other example
[17:05:28] <pl0sh> ajpiano:  thanks, let me take a look
[17:05:31] <ajpiano> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[17:06:37] <ProLoser|Work> what's the difference between creating and extending?
[17:06:45] <ProLoser|Work> sorry i mean extending and constructing
[17:06:53] <ProLoser|Work> like, why would i need to do both?
[17:07:29] <ajpiano> the difference between building the constructor... and calling it
[17:07:40] <Poopy> http://pastebin.com/yXEywY2w <-- For whatever reason, the drop function worked once but after making a slight change, it stopped working. Now the droppable-active class works when I pick up the draggable item, but that's it
[17:07:43] <doup> i'm following the jquery-ui docs for an effect, I want to hide an element with a "clip" effect, I've set it, but it just hides after the defined time has lapsed, no transitions, any idea?
[17:08:26] <ajpiano> var Something = Backbone.Model.extend() // is extending.  var mything = new Something();  // is creating
[17:08:27] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work
[17:09:18] <bboyrman> hey guys. I have some divs on a page, and i made them sortable with jquery ui. In each div there is a table, and i make the trs of those table also sortable. The problem is when i click on a tr to try and sort it, it selects the parent div instead for sorting :/. Is there a way to make kinda like "greedy", so that the tr has the priority on the div sorting?
[17:09:32] <ProLoser|Work> so first i should put everything i want it to do into extend, and then just create it?
[17:09:34] <ProLoser|Work> and that's it?
[17:09:55] <ajpiano> ...
[17:10:12] <ProLoser|Work> i just mean i'm having a hard time getting what to DO with the objectt i created
[17:10:16] <ajpiano> the extend is how the class works, then you create instances of it
[17:10:25] <ajpiano> yeah you like
[17:10:28] <ajpiano> really need to write a test app
[17:10:33] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying to
[17:10:35] <ajpiano> or understand how the Todo example works or something
[17:11:04] <ajpiano> when you create the model, you'll then create a view that associates with it
[17:11:17] <ajpiano> and then the view binds to events on the model, and then rerenders itself
[17:11:29] <ajpiano> or serves as an interface to editing the fields (a form) and then sets the attributes on the model
[17:13:04] <kanzie> aw man, Im spinning in circles trying to understand how to best use the module-pattern but still get good jsdoc documentation. Just as I thought I had it locked down I come across articles saying I should refrain from this method and instead use prototype to extend my object to avoid flooding the memory with redundant functions.
[17:13:47] <kanzie> Am I just confusing things here or should I indeed create my namespace object and then add everything to the prototype of this object?
[17:17:26] <coldhead> ot
[17:17:35] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[17:29:39] <avent> I have a little dilemma
[17:29:48] <avent> This is my code as of now: http://jsfiddle.net/3rxme/
[17:30:13] <avent> I have an "Add Book" button that adds another <ul> which works find
[17:30:15] <avent> fine*
[17:30:36] <avent> But now I wish to have a "Remove Book" button as well that does just the opposite
[17:30:43] <ProLoser|Work> what's a good question to a new prospect to see if jquery is a crutch to them?
[17:31:11] <avent> www.ubc-books.com/sell.html if you wish to see the script in action.
[17:31:46] <bobdobbs> ProLoser|Work: maybe something to do with dom travesal without the aid of a library/
[17:31:51] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: those people are the best employees
[17:32:01] <ajpiano> avent: this fiddle will show you an example of how to achieve that http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/v8U3W/
[17:32:22] <ProLoser|Work> well i heard there was a question about animation that's good to ask
[17:32:26] <coldhead> what have you got against people getting their work done more quickly and more simplt? :)
[17:32:46] <avent> ajpiano: thanks, I'll look into it :)
[17:33:04] <bobdobbs> coldhead: I can see what he means. Jquery helps me get stuff done, and it's helped me to not learn about javascript.
[17:33:16] <ProLoser|Work> i know there was a blog post about hiring ui guys
[17:33:24] <ProLoser|Work> and one was about how people don't know vanilla js
[17:33:26] <bobdobbs> I'm having trouble getting a set of elements. I'd like to get "the second child of each li
[17:33:36] <coldhead> bobdobbs: it helped me learn js by making me not have to learn all the cross-browser hacks
[17:33:41] <coldhead> it's a Good THing
[17:33:41] <ajpiano> yeah i mean obviously
[17:33:48] <ajpiano> if one knew vanilla jS
[17:34:04] <ajpiano> that person would of COURSE know about the difference between creating a constructor and invoking the constructor
[17:34:12] <ajpiano> and would be able to identify that pattern in a library
[17:34:21] <coldhead> >_>
[17:34:31] <ajpiano> <_<
[17:34:49] <coldhead> people who are like "jQuery is for noobs, i don't need it" can fuck off back to openbsd
[17:35:24] <coldhead> "what's the point in an OS if you don't have to write your own drivers for your hardware" &c.
[17:35:55] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: i think you're better off testing people's JS knowledge than you are making sure they're too vain for jQuery
[17:36:39] <bobdobbs> coldhead: maybe ProLoser|Work is trying to get better value... Like, people with deeper knowldge of js will be able to use jquery more effectively
[17:36:51] <bobdobbs> any library more effectively
[17:37:05] <coldhead> right but you can have that without having to shun jQuery
[17:37:16] <bobdobbs> I know that I'd be a better, and much faster  programmer if I understood js better.
[17:37:17] <coldhead> i think the crutch question is the wrong angle
[17:37:21] <coldhead> a la lovecraft
[17:37:38] <coldhead> i'd be a better and faster programmer with more amphetamines
[17:37:59] <coldhead> and a tea lady with a trolley full of cakes and scones would be nice too
[17:38:52] <bobdobbs> I think the long term benefits of a deep understanding of javascript are somewhat greater then having a speed habit.
[17:39:04] <bobdobbs> Mind you, a tea lady would be nice.
[17:39:09] <bobdobbs> I like a good scone
[17:39:15] <bobdobbs> miss them, I do.
[17:40:51] <bobdobbs> How do I get the nth-child of each of a set of elements? I'm trying this:http://jsfiddle.net/

[17:42:01] <erichynds> bobdobbs: press the "save" button on jsfiddle and post the link

[17:43:32] <bobdobbs> http://jsfiddle.net/FtZC7/1/
[17:44:20] <erichynds> well.. that dom structure doesn't match your JS
[17:44:29] <bobdobbs> aw crap
[17:44:38] <bobdobbs> I'll fix it up. sorry
[17:45:16] <erichynds> you're close though
[17:48:10] <avent> I can't seem to figure this out. Can anyone specifically help me?
[17:49:18] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/hWrPFyVWViERU1dWC2Py/
[17:49:34] <coldhead> those are some hard JS questions people have asked before
[18:00:27] <ProLoser|Work> coldhead: negative padding?
[18:00:37] <ProLoser|Work> like setting the child element to have negative margin?
[18:01:11] <bobdobbs> Here's my update: http://jsfiddle.net/FtZC7/4/
[18:01:36] <bobdobbs> I still can't seem to get my target: the second child of each li
[18:02:24] <bobdobbs> my attempt just seems to get only the second child of the first li
[18:03:03] <dschuett> why would UNchecked checkbox values be getting sent as ON when passing it to a php script?
[18:03:59] <Poopy> Hello all. I'm frustrated because I keep having my javascript script work then five minutes later they don't. Was there a lot of bugs in Jquery UI 1.6 or am changing something without realizing it? <33 jQuery btw, no disrespect intended

[18:04:56] <bobdobbs> aaaah
[18:05:14] <bobdobbs> erichynds: thanks. Looks like I was misreading the docs for that method
[18:05:27] <erichynds> no problem
[18:07:37] <dschuett> I have never seen checkbox values get set when they are unchecked.... this is crazy
[18:12:41] <IfTrueElseFalse> Anybody know why on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ the error callback is not called for jsonp? I read the note "Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests" but not why and what the alternative is
[18:16:09] <Spadeski> Hi people

[18:31:41] <coldhead> sorry Spadeski, i am putting out IE fires
[18:33:20] <ProLoser|Work> why would i use window.Something = whatever rather than just var something = whatever?
[18:33:26] <ProLoser|Work> or uh the other equivalent that i'm forgetting
[18:33:36] <ProLoser|Work> namely, why would i TRY to set something to the global namespace on purpose?
[18:34:05] <smplstk> ProLoser|Work, typically you wouldn't cast a var by doing window.var = 'foo';
[18:34:23] <snover> assign*
[18:34:48] <snover> you would do it intentionally if you wanted it there to access globallyâ¦
[18:34:54] <snover> I donât know what kind of question that isâ¦
[18:35:04] <snover> it is like asking, âwhy would I poop?â
[18:35:08] <snover> because you have to poop
[18:35:11] <snover> thatâs why
[18:35:11] <smplstk> haha
[18:35:17] <ProLoser|Work> haha
[18:35:20] <avent> Heshanh: I am not sure to be honest

[18:35:33] <smplstk> you can have variables in the global space without using window though...
[18:35:50] <smplstk> unless im like, on crack or something?
[18:36:09] <wookiehangover> totes mcgoats
[18:36:29] <smplstk> I just don't see a real reason to use window.myvar = 'foo' like... ever
[18:36:33] <wookiehangover> that's what not using var is for
[18:36:43] <wookiehangover> well, its more explicit
[18:37:12] <Spadeski> its kewl coldhead
[18:37:14] <wookiehangover> like, i'd leave a comment if I was intentionally making a global by omitting var
[18:37:14] <Spadeski>  im trying to recreate something
[18:37:26] <foo> smplstk: you have something against me? just say it
[18:37:28] <wookiehangover> so that I don't, like, fix it later

[19:03:41] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure that's not what you want
[19:04:03] <avent> 1 second let me revert my site to what it was at before.
[19:05:48] <avent> Eviltwin: Alright, check out www.ubc-books.com/sell.html again and press the [+ Add Book] button

[19:13:09] <avent> Because there is no unique element to the last <ul>
[19:13:16] <avent> So how do I know which one to delete?
[19:13:24] <Eviltwin> Try $("#sell_layout ul:last").remove()
[19:13:41] <avent> okay :)
[19:16:24] <avent> Eviltwin: Doesn't work but I do see how it makes sense
[19:17:11] <Eviltwin> No, what I wrote works
[19:17:26] <Eviltwin> The element you're trying to bind the click to doesn't exist :P
[19:17:41] <Eviltwin> You need $("#remove_book") not $("remove_book")
[19:18:06] <avent> duh~ thanks! :)
[19:18:52] <Eviltwin> avent: Now you still have the problem if them being able to delete all of the ULs
[19:19:12] <avent> Works! =) Now the last thing I would like to implement is that there is always at least 1 ul left
[19:19:15] <avent> Yeah :)
[19:19:24] <avent> You're reading my thought
[19:19:35] <avent> thoughts*
[19:19:57] <rocktop> I have some element with same class and deffirent id  when I click on one of them I want the other elemenet hide ? can some one help ?
[19:21:36] <rocktop> anyidea ?
[19:22:01] <Eviltwin> avent: Okay, it's messy but you can do: $("#sell_layout ul:not(:first):last")
[19:22:19] <realpap> could someone please help me with this: http://fiddle.jshell.net/s3SGL/6/, this line makes the hover work on css>>> .main-menu li:hover ul, .main-menu li li:hover ul{ left: auto;}, but if i remove it css AND jquery dropdown stop working
[19:22:22] <avent> rocktop, even though I probably can't help... it's usually best if you paste your code here: http://jsfiddle.net
[19:22:43] <avent> Thanks Evil, I'll give it a try
[19:23:25] <kborchers> rocktop: in your click handler you can do $(".className").not(this).hide();
[19:24:14] <Eviltwin> realpap: Maybe leave it then?
[19:25:21] <Eviltwin> kborchers: Neat trick
[19:26:25] <avent> so basically the '.not(this)' says hide() everything except for (this)?
[19:26:46] <realpap> Elivtwin: if i leave the line it works buggly
[19:26:52] <realpap> the first time responses to the css
[19:26:56] <realpap> and the secon one to the jquery
[19:27:02] <realpap> i want only the jquery to act
[19:27:50] <Eviltwin> avent: jQuery works by operating on and manipulating collections of elements
[19:28:25] <Eviltwin> avent: So $(".className") creates a collection of all of the elements that have the class "className"
[19:29:13] <Eviltwin> Then when you call .not(this) on that collection, it creates a new collection of all of the elements in that first collection except this element
[19:29:22] <avent> I see
[19:29:28] <avent> That makes sense.
[19:29:44] <avent> $("#sell_layout ul:last").not(first).hide();
[19:29:48] <avent> would this then work?
[19:29:54] <Eviltwin> No
[19:30:34] <Eviltwin> The variable first is not declared in your scope
[19:30:46] <Eviltwin> So you're saying everything except a non-existent element
[19:30:56] <avent> What is my scope?
[19:31:06] <Eviltwin> Your JavaScript variables
[19:31:10] <Eviltwin> You haven't created a "first" variable
[19:31:16] <avent> I see
[19:31:43] <rocktop> kborchers: $(sel).click(function(){ $(this).not(this).hide();	});
[19:32:01] <rocktop> kborchers: dosn't work can you check that code please ?
[19:32:03] <kborchers> rocktop: no
[19:32:19] <Eviltwin> You could do $("#sell_layout ul").not(":first").last()
[19:32:22] <rocktop> kborchers: I have other element with same class
[19:32:39] <Coderah> rocktop: don't ask someone specifically ask your question to the whole channel if someone can help they will
[19:32:59] <kborchers> Coderah: it's cool, i was already helping
[19:33:01] <Spadeski> Eviltwin That was Genius
[19:33:05] <avent> Eviltwin: That would not remove/hide any elements then, would it?
[19:33:12] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: ?
[19:33:40] <kborchers> rocktop: what is the class name?
[19:33:42] <Eviltwin> avent: That would first build a collection of all of the ULs inside #sell_layout
[19:33:47] <Coderah> kborchers: k my bad must have missed something lol
[19:33:53] <rocktop> kborchers: ittable
[19:33:55] <Eviltwin> avent: Then filter it to all of the ones that aren't the first one in that collection
[19:34:04] <Eviltwin> avent: Then grab the last one from that collection
[19:34:14] <Eviltwin> Now that you have that collection, you can do whatever you want to it
[19:34:18] <Eviltwin> Just .hide() or whatever on the end
[19:34:26] <Eviltwin> Or .remove() in your case
[19:34:29] <Spadeski> Just is with the .not() made my day
[19:34:50] <kborchers> $(".ittable").click(function(){ $(".ittable").not(this).hide();});
[19:34:54] <avent> Eviltwin: That makes perfect sense now. Thanks so much.
[19:35:18] <Eviltwin> avent: A lot of the operations can be packed into one just one giant selector
[19:35:24] <Eviltwin> Which generally saves characters but not much else
[19:37:12] <avent> Eviltwin: Mhm. So theoretically I could go: 'rem = $("#sell_layout ul").not(":first").last();' and then 'rem.remove();'
[19:37:21] <Eviltwin> avent: Sure
[19:37:58] <rocktop> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/wvMtr/3/
[19:38:01] <avent> Eviltwin: Thanks so much. I'm really starting to understand this more and more. :)
[19:38:07] <Eviltwin> avent: Or 'var myuls = $("#sell_layout ul"); myuls.not(":first").last().remove()'
[19:38:40] <Eviltwin> You have to be careful with what you save though
[19:39:03] <Eviltwin> A jQuery collection doesn't automatically update as the DOM changes
[19:39:13] <avent> Eviltwin: That would be handy if I wanted to do more with myuls then
[19:39:24] <Eviltwin> So you can't just do rem = $("#sell_layout ul").not(":first").last(); once and then keep calling rem.remove() inside your click handler
[19:39:30] <Eviltwin> You actually need to reselect them
[19:39:39] <avent> I see
[19:39:51] <kborchers> rocktop: you got a bit of a mess there. give me a minute
[19:40:01] <avent> And there is no shortcut to doing that?
[19:40:05] <Eviltwin> However if you want to do a bunch of things to the same collection of elements over time, you can save it
[19:40:07] <rocktop> kborchers:OK
[19:40:15] <Eviltwin> avent: Not short cut to what?
[19:43:08] <avent> Eviltwin: Okay, so if you remove() the last UL, if you were to call the same command again, it wouldn't do anything because it doesn't know what the last UL is. Am I understanding this right?
[19:43:43] <Eviltwin> Well it wouldn't appear to do anything but it would actually attempt to remove that same UL again
[19:43:57] <avent> Yes :)
[19:44:12] <avent> So, you would first have to tell it to find the last UL again, correct?
[19:44:36] <Eviltwin> Yes, because as far as jQuery knows, all rem is is an arbirary collection of elements
[19:44:56] <Eviltwin> And there can be many ways to refer to the same element
[19:45:19] <Eviltwin> For example when there's more than one book, $("#sell_layout ul").not(":first").last() identical to $("#sell_layout ul").last()
[19:46:05] <avent> So if you were to do that, it would be handy to save 'myuls.not(":first").last()' in a variable like 'last = myuls.not(":first").last()' and then from there on just say: last.remove();
[19:46:22] <kborchers> rocktop: http://jsfiddle.net/wvMtr/5/
[19:46:22] <Eviltwin> Internally jQuery builds something kind of like a selector to do the same thing again
[19:46:57] <Eviltwin> But it's not necessarily all of the information you need
[19:47:13] <avent> I see
[19:47:24] <avent> Well in my case it seems to be working ok
[19:47:33] <kborchers> rocktop: don't use onclick and click handlers and i commented out the part we weren't talking about after updating it to use the handler
[19:48:17] <Eviltwin> avent: As far as I can tell, you're recreating the collection every time, so it's fine
[19:49:39] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to grab a random element from a list, and then doing something with it. So far I have this: http://pastie.org/2653104
[19:50:06] <avent> Eviltwin: yeah :) now I have another question that might be slightly moving away from jquery. basically I am wondering... now that I duplicated the <ul> all the <form>'s included in them have been duplicated, Which means there is now 2 forms with the id="title" for example
[19:50:10] <bobdobbs> This gets a random element, but I can't do anything with is, because I've got it as a string.
[19:50:25] <bobdobbs> How can I grab the selector for a random element?\
[19:50:50] <avent> if I send this to the .php document now to analyze, will it have trouble if it gets different data from the same id or will I be able to distinguish between them?
[19:50:52] <Eviltwin> avent: My advice is that for anything you .clone(), either don't use ids or change all the IDs before you add it to the DOM
[19:50:59] <Coderah> bobdobbs: hey i helped you last night.. i made a mistake you need to use eq
[19:51:17] <bobdobbs> hi Coderah
[19:51:28] <Coderah> randEl = parent.eq((Math.floor(Math.random()*parent.length)))
[19:51:30] <Coderah> try that
[19:51:31] <Eviltwin> avent: And for forms, it uses the names, not the ids
[19:51:49] <bobdobbs> Coderah: thanks. I'll play with that.
[19:51:54] <avent> Eviltwin: sorry yeah, that's what I meant
[19:52:20] <avent> there will now be 2 or more forms with the same name
[19:52:37] <avent> sending out different data to, in this case, sell.php
[19:53:10] <bobdobbs> Coderah: that does the trick! Thanks again.
[19:54:35] <Coderah> bobdobbs: no problem. i should have caught that last night haha
[19:54:38] <Eviltwin> avent: I suggest you do two things. First, move your template into a hidden div or something
[19:54:46] <Eviltwin> Then on load clone the first one
[19:55:01] <Eviltwin> And when you clone it, update all the inputs so their names are name+"[0]"
[19:55:49] <avent> Eviltwin: What would the hidden div be for?
[19:57:31] <Eviltwin> The simplest way to fix this is to index the inputs
[19:57:39] <Eviltwin> So rather than title
[19:57:40] <Eviltwin> title[0]
[19:57:42] <Eviltwin> then title[1]
[19:57:59] <Eviltwin> PHP side this $_POST['title'] will be an array
[19:58:25] <Eviltwin> But your template won't have a number attached to it
[19:58:30] <Eviltwin> We'll add the number to the copies
[19:58:33] <Eviltwin> Something like this: http://pastebin.com/jnXDbiie
[19:58:50] <Eviltwin> Where #sell_form is your hidden template
[20:00:39] <avent> So instead of having the <ul id="sell_form"> create a <div id="sell_form"> that encompasses the <ul> and style it 'visibility:hidden'?
[20:01:40] <abjorn> I wish .js was a valid TLD
[20:02:25] <Coderah> abjorn: that would be pretty much epic
[20:04:01] <Eviltwin> avent: More like <div style="display:none"><ul id="sell_form">...</ul></div>
[20:04:43] <abjorn> I suppose then .c, .cpp, .py, etc would then become valid TLDs if that happened, though...and thats just overkill
[20:05:14] <abjorn> pft whatever, TLD's are a retarded useless concept anyways
[20:05:33] <avent> Eviltwin: Why exactly would I use the <div> with the 'style:none'?
[20:06:30] <abjorn> display:none, not style:none
[20:06:51] <avent> Sorry, that's what I meant ^   Thanks :)
[20:07:28] <Eviltwin> avent: Because we don't want to see it, we don't want it to actually be part of the form
[20:07:35] <Eviltwin> avent: It is used as our template
[20:07:42] <Eviltwin> Everything in the form, we want to have that extra processing done
[20:07:44] <abjorn> display:none;visibility:hidden; is better
[20:07:54] <abjorn> double the invisible!
[20:08:24] <abjorn> Personally I'd have a .hidden class that does this
[20:08:28] <abjorn> so I don't have to add inline styles
[20:09:08] <avent> Eviltwin: I am kind of confused right now but I'll just keep going. I think I'll figure it out
[20:09:31] <abjorn> That's the spirit!
[20:09:37] <abjorn> Or...the attitiude!
[20:09:37] <abjorn> Or
[20:09:38] <Eviltwin> avent: I'll try to make an example
[20:09:40] <abjorn> ah fuck it
[20:09:49] <avent> lol
[20:09:52] <avent> alright, thanks!
[20:11:07] <avent> also, 'tmp.find("input").each(function () {' < this I don't quite understand. is it.... within 'tmp' find <input>.... and then I don't know yet what the .each(function() { does
[20:17:48] <Eviltwin> avent: http://jsfiddle.net/njtTW/
[20:18:05] <Eviltwin> avent: That thing with the .each was me being too clever
[20:18:10] <Eviltwin> ?.each @ avent
[20:18:11] <bot-t> avent, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[20:20:01] <avent> Eviltwin: I'll have to read over that once my mind is a little clearer, I'll look into your jsfiddle for now and make sense of it
[20:21:23] <avent> $(this) = input?
[20:21:48] <Eviltwin> this = that particular <input>
[20:21:58] <Eviltwin> $(this) = jQuery object containing that particular <input>
[20:22:00] <Spadeski> (this) means any object you are selecting before hand
[20:22:02] <Spadeski>  
[20:22:17] <dogarrhea2> anArray=grep(anArray, function(n,i){return(n!= "undefined");}); <-------- object expected error
[20:23:08] <avent> I see
[20:23:40] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Sure you don't mean $.grep ?
[20:24:38] <avent> My mind is still foggy about the whole each() thing but I'll leave it at that for no
[20:24:40] <avent> now*
[20:24:49] <Eviltwin> I can explain it
[20:24:53] <avent> Sure
[20:25:05] <Eviltwin> So let's talk about this specific example
[20:25:16] <Eviltwin> copy.find("input")
[20:25:21] <Eviltwin> Do you know what that creates a collection of?
[20:25:31] <dogarrhea2> that fixed it Eviltwin thanks
[20:25:37] <rocktop> kborchers: Thank you very very much it work pretty much
[20:25:43] <avent> <input> and whatever is inside
[20:25:53] <avent> <input ....>
[20:26:10] <Eviltwin> All of the input tags contained within copy
[20:26:17] <kborchers> rocktop: yeah, it probably needs some tweaking for your particular situation but hopefully got you on the right track
[20:26:22] <Eviltwin> So in our case there will be two elements
[20:26:28] <Eviltwin> <input type="text" name="first" value=""> and <input type="text" name="last" value="">
[20:26:37] <avent> Okay, I see
[20:26:45] <Eviltwin> The .each() calls that function
[20:26:54] <Eviltwin> First with "this" being the <input type="text" name="first" value=""> element
[20:27:04] <Eviltwin> Then with "this" being the <input type="text" name="last" value=""> element
[20:27:26] <avent> So it loops through it?
[20:27:28] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:27:38] <avent> selecting one after the other?
[20:27:42] <Eviltwin> Basically, yes
[20:27:49] <avent> I see
[20:28:12] <avent> So in the next line: $(this).attr("name", $(this).attr("name") + "[" + n + "]");
[20:28:18] <Eviltwin> (There are reasons why this can be more useful than your basic loop but those reasons might confuse you)
[20:28:36] <Eviltwin> ?.attr @ avent
[20:28:38] <bot-t> avent, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[20:28:43] <avent> Yes
[20:28:45] <Eviltwin> There are two syntaxes for .attr
[20:28:51] <Eviltwin> .attr("name") returns the name as a string
[20:28:55] <tash> looking for some help with prettyPhoto, anyone used it before?
[20:28:59] <Eviltwin> .attr("name",val) sets the name to val
[20:29:07] <avent> Yep
[20:29:15] <avent> I read that in a tutorial
[20:29:24] <avent> And i think I understand what that line does
[20:29:26] <Eviltwin> So I am setting the name to what the name was plus "["+n+"]" on the end
[20:29:41] <avent> yep
[20:29:41] <Eviltwin> If it was "first" and n is 0, it will be set to "first[0]"
[20:29:49] <avent> That makes sense =)
[20:29:53] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:30:00] <Eviltwin> The next line is just to illustrate that the names are being set
[20:30:12] <Eviltwin> It sets the value of those text fields so you can see what their names are
[20:30:40] <Eviltwin> Then once the loop is over
[20:30:42] <avent> Okay lemme think about that for a sec :P
[20:30:45] <Eviltwin> It increases n by one
[20:30:51] <avent> Yeah
[20:30:54] <Eviltwin> And appends this copy of the fields to the form
[20:31:15] <avent> question now
[20:31:21] <avent> For the each()
[20:31:37] <avent> once it went through once, in our case "first"
[20:31:45] <avent> then it goes to "last"
[20:32:01] <avent> and it would add on a [0] on the last as well, correct?
[20:32:08] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:32:14] <Eviltwin> Because n doesn't change until *after* the loop
[20:32:19] <Eviltwin> After the .each
[20:32:37] <Eviltwin> See how it's after the .each(function(){...}) ?
[20:32:38] <avent> Mhm
[20:32:42] <avent> Yep
[20:32:44] <avent> Got it :)
[20:32:47] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:32:56] <avent> Now why do we need to appendTo at the end though?
[20:32:56] <Eviltwin> So good with addOne?
[20:33:10] <Eviltwin> What we've done so far is make a copy
[20:33:16] <Eviltwin> But it's not anywhere in the DOM yet
[20:33:20] <Eviltwin> It's just floating off in space
[20:33:27] <avent> DOM stands for what again? Sorry, I forget.
[20:33:33] <Eviltwin> Document Object Model
[20:33:50] <Eviltwin> Basically what I'm saying is that these elements exist but aren't actually anywhere in the page
[20:33:52] <tash> hmm, using prettyPhoto and the close button isn't appearing.  Anyone used it before?
[20:34:08] <Eviltwin> So we need to put them somewhere in the page
[20:34:18] <Eviltwin> In this case we want them to be added to the form element
[20:34:39] <avent> Okay
[20:34:43] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[20:34:44] <avent> Makes sense
[20:34:49] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:34:51] <avent> Whew this is a steep elarning curve
[20:34:54] <avent> learning*
[20:34:57] <Eviltwin> So now on to removeOne
[20:35:04] <Eviltwin> We're doing the same thing you do now
[20:35:15] <Eviltwin> Grabbing the last UL in the form as long as it's not also the first
[20:35:33] <Eviltwin> If it's the first, the collection is empty
[20:35:42] <Eviltwin> If it's not the first, the collection has the last UL in it
[20:35:49] <Eviltwin> So I check to see if it's empty
[20:35:50] <avent> mhm
[20:36:06] <Eviltwin> If it is empty, we don't want to do anything, so we just return
[20:36:15] <Eviltwin> As a result we don't remove anything and, most importantly, don't change n
[20:36:29] <avent> Could you explain this please?
[20:36:34] <Eviltwin> Which part?
[20:36:37] <avent> What do you mean with "it is empty"?
[20:36:50] <Eviltwin> Have you worked with arrays/lists before?
[20:36:56] <Eviltwin> (In any programming language)
[20:37:01] <avent> Yes
[20:37:11] <Eviltwin> Empty means it has zero things in it
[20:37:54] <avent> in our case, when would that happen?
[20:38:02] <avent> coudl you give me an example?
[20:38:05] <avent> could*
[20:38:22] <Eviltwin> When there's only one set of fields in the form
[20:38:32] <Eviltwin> Want me to walk you through why?
[20:39:02] <avent> Sure
[20:39:21] <Eviltwin> Okay, so let's look first at the example where there are three ULs in the form A, B, and C
[20:39:27] <avent> You have no idea how thankful I am for all of this
[20:39:33] <Eviltwin> When we do $("#form ul"), we'll get a list [A, B, C]
[20:39:40] <Eviltwin> Where those represent the ULs in order in the form
[20:39:47] <avent> correct
[20:39:48] <Eviltwin> Next we do .not(':first')
[20:39:53] <Eviltwin> To that collection
[20:40:01] <abjorn> ?js Array(16).join("lol" - 2) + "batman"
[20:40:03] <bot-t> abjorn: "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNbatman"
[20:40:05] <Eviltwin> This tells jQuery to create a new collection where we have all except the first element in the old collection
[20:40:23] <Eviltwin> So it'll be [B, C] at that point
[20:40:30] <avent> so [B, C]
[20:40:33] <avent> yeah
[20:40:38] <Eviltwin> Finally we call .last() which tells jQuery to take the collection and only grab that last thing from it
[20:40:41] <Eviltwin> So [C]
[20:40:52] <avent> *click*
[20:40:54] <avent> ahhh!
[20:41:02] <avent> so if it were [ ] empty at that point
[20:41:05] <Eviltwin> Now let's look at the example where there's only one UL A
[20:41:14] <avent> okay
[20:41:15] <Eviltwin> $("#form ul") gives us [A]
[20:41:28] <Eviltwin> Calling .not(':first') on that gives us all the elements of the collection that aren't the first
[20:41:31] <Eviltwin> So []
[20:41:42] <avent> mhm
[20:41:44] <Eviltwin> Calling .last() on that gives us the last element in the collection but there aren't any so it's []
[20:41:56] <Eviltwin> So now when I check the length of the collection, it will be 0
[20:41:59] <avent> yes
[20:42:10] <Eviltwin> So in that case, I'd return
[20:42:11] <avent> wow, that makes sense now :)
[20:42:20] <Eviltwin> So I wouldn't do the .remove() and I wouldn't do the n--
[20:42:26] <avent> mhm
[20:42:28] <Eviltwin> In every other case, I would
[20:42:33] <avent> return does what exactly?
[20:42:46] <avent> return where?
[20:42:49] <Eviltwin> Have you done programming with functions before?
[20:42:55] <Eviltwin> (In any programming langauge)
[20:42:59] <Eviltwin> language*
[20:43:06] <avent> I have, but it's been a long time
[20:43:16] <Eviltwin> Okay, return tells it to go back to the thing that called it
[20:43:35] <Eviltwin> So when we call return there, it's going to jump back into that click handler for $("#remove")
[20:43:46] <Eviltwin> Just like when we reach the end of the function
[20:44:09] <avent> Ah okay
[20:44:14] <Eviltwin> This would have had the same effect: http://pastebin.com/bHGc5PXv
[20:44:28] <avent> So it would basically wait for the next 'click'?
[20:44:46] <Eviltwin> Short answer: Yes
[20:45:00] <avent> Haha, great! Wow :)
[20:45:22] <avent> Okay so far so good
[20:45:26] <Eviltwin> Now I immediately call addOne()
[20:45:32] <Eviltwin> Because without doing that, the form will just be empty
[20:45:38] <Eviltwin> Note above in the HTML: <form id="form"></form>
[20:45:43] <Eviltwin> It starts empty
[20:45:47] <avent> Yes
[20:46:06] <Eviltwin> So immediately when it loads, it's going to clone the template and make the 0th UL in the form
[20:46:22] <Eviltwin> Then I add the click listeners
[20:46:29] <Eviltwin> One to the add button to call addOne
[20:46:34] <Eviltwin> And one to the remove button to call remvoeOne
[20:46:36] <Eviltwin> removeOne*
[20:46:55] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[20:47:00] <avent> Yep
[20:47:06] <Eviltwin> And that's the end of the code
[20:47:08] <avent> Just the return false;
[20:47:20] <avent> Could you explain exactly why that is needed again?
[20:47:34] <Eviltwin> That prevents the default action
[20:47:43] <Eviltwin> When you click, the default action is to follow the link
[20:47:51] <avent> Right
[20:47:56] <Eviltwin> If you don't want to follow the link, you have to stop it from doing that
[20:48:00] <Eviltwin> And that's done via return false
[20:48:11] <avent> I have seen many ways explained so far
[20:48:17] <avent> .preventDefault
[20:48:22] <avent> .stopPropagation
[20:48:26] <avent> return false
[20:48:34] <avent> what's the difference between all of them?
[20:48:49] <Eviltwin> "Returning false from a handler is equivalent to calling both .preventDefault() and .stopPropagation() on the event object."
[20:49:03] <Eviltwin> Do you know what event bubbling is?
[20:49:11] <avent> No
[20:49:13] <avent> :(
[20:49:18] <Eviltwin> Okay, so let's say I have an image
[20:49:25] <Eviltwin> Inside an A tag (link)
[20:49:29] <Eviltwin> Inside the body of my page
[20:49:34] <Eviltwin> And I click on that image
[20:49:41] <avent> Yes
[20:49:44] <Eviltwin> Well I didn't just click on that image
[20:49:52] <Eviltwin> I also technically clciked on that image
[20:49:56] <Eviltwin> And clicked on the body
[20:50:12] <Eviltwin> So what happens is the event bubbles
[20:50:19] <Eviltwin> It calls all the handlers for the image
[20:50:24] <Eviltwin> Then all the handlers for the link
[20:50:29] <Eviltwin> Then all the handlers for the body
[20:50:46] <Eviltwin> Sometimes you don't want that
[20:50:51] <avent> mhm
[20:50:54] <Eviltwin> Sometimes you have some logic higher up that you don't want to trigger
[20:51:01] <Eviltwin> That's what .stopPropagation() does
[20:51:11] <Eviltwin> It prevents the event from bubbling up any higher
[20:51:22] <avent> could you give an example when it would be used?
[20:51:46] <Eviltwin> When what is used? Event bubbling?
[20:51:55] <avent> .stopPropagation()
[20:52:26] <Eviltwin> Let's say you have a map or something
[20:52:32] <avent> mhm
[20:52:37] <Eviltwin> And clicking on the map causes a little window to appear there with some details about that location
[20:52:45] <Eviltwin> Clicking anywhere on the map does this
[20:52:59] <Eviltwin> Now inside that window you have some other controls, like a close button etc
[20:53:07] <avent> ok
[20:53:11] <Eviltwin> If the click on the close bubbles up through the map
[20:53:20] <Eviltwin> The map's going to think you clicked on the map again and want to bring up the info window
[20:53:32] <avent> ooooh
[20:53:34] <Eviltwin> So you'd want the handler for your close button to stop that propogation
[20:53:37] <avent> wow, yeah.
[20:53:42] <avent> I think I understand now
[20:53:59] <Eviltwin> .preventDefault() is different in the sense that it only stops the browser from doing what it was going to do by default
[20:54:07] <Eviltwin> Like following a link when you click it
[20:54:11] <avent> mhm
[20:54:17] <Eviltwin> Or submitting a form when you press the submit button
[20:54:41] <Eviltwin> And return false causes both of those things to happen
[20:54:51] <avent> So for stopPropagation() you kind of need to think of layers and it only reacts to the top layer if you use it.
[20:54:57] <avent> is that right?
[20:54:59] <avent> mhm
[20:55:21] <Eviltwin> As soon as stopPropagation is called, the event will stop bubbling up
[20:55:41] <avent> Okay... Wow.
[20:55:42] <Eviltwin> Nothing further up in the tree will have its event listeners called for that event
[20:55:56] <avent> That makes sense :)
[20:55:57] <Eviltwin> (There's a hell of a lot going on inside your browser)
[20:56:05] <avent> I realize that now
[20:56:42] <avent> Okay so what I'll do is with what I learned.... I'll try to implement this on my site
[20:56:57] <Eviltwin> Okay, it's going to be pretty similar to that fiddle I sent
[20:57:01] <avent> And I'll give you a sample before I upload it to have a look over it?
[20:57:04] <avent> Yeah
[20:57:16] <Eviltwin> Sure, I can take a look when it's ready
[20:57:20] <avent> I just want to create 2 functions like in your pastebin
[20:57:28] <avent> one to add and one to remove
[20:57:45] <avent> wait nvm
[20:57:49] <avent> that was in your fiddle
[20:58:06] <avent> So yeah, like in your fiddle :)
[20:58:32] <Eviltwin> Ha ha, yeah
[20:58:37] <bobdobbs> I'm really confused. I have some code. when I isolate it into a function, it behaves differently. It gives a different return value.
[20:58:47] <bobdobbs> This is the code: http://pastie.org/2653312
[20:59:04] <Eviltwin> Why don't you have a var on randEl?
[20:59:19] <bobdobbs> would that help?
[20:59:32] <Eviltwin> It changes the scope of the variable
[20:59:42] <bobdobbs> ah. ok
[20:59:54] <Eviltwin> Anything without a var is assumed to be global scope
[21:00:00] <Eviltwin> Ususally not what you want inside a function
[21:00:15] <bobdobbs> I see
[21:00:17] <bobdobbs> thanks
[21:00:26] <Eviltwin> I shouldn't say anthing, the function arguments are in the function's scope
[21:00:53] <bobdobbs> ok, I've changed it.
[21:00:54] <Eviltwin> avent: Might be worth saving a transcript of this convo for future reference :P
[21:01:10] <avent> True.
[21:01:12] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: I'm still getting the same wierdness though...
[21:01:13] <avent> Will do :)
[21:01:26] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: You haven't given any context or told us what the "weirdness" is
[21:01:32] <Eviltwin> So I'm not sure how I'm supposed to help you
[21:01:39] <bobdobbs> If the code is in docready, randEl gives me a selector
[21:01:59] <bobdobbs> In I put that code in a function, it gives me back the string content of the selector
[21:02:19] <Eviltwin> What selector?
[21:02:59] <bobdobbs> a randomly selected child of an li
[21:03:25] <Eviltwin> How have you determined this?
[21:04:10] <joey55> I am trying to use jQuery draggable but I keep getting the error ".draggable is not a function". I have jquery UI included in the page
[21:04:14] <bobdobbs> By using two different versions of the code - one with the code in docready, and one with the code inside a function within docready
[21:04:15] <joey55> any thoughts?
[21:04:37] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: This is JavaScript firing in a page, how have you determined what the return value is? Firebug?
[21:04:45] <bobdobbs> Eyes
[21:04:54] <bobdobbs> sorry, misstype...
[21:04:54] <Eviltwin> What did your eyes show you?
[21:05:05] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: I meant to type 'yes'
[21:05:26] <bobdobbs> Yeah, I entered 'randEl' from the firebug console.
[21:05:27] <coldhead> lol
[21:05:29] <Eviltwin> Firebug will sometimes create a selector-like thing for you to tell you where the element is
[21:05:43] <Eviltwin> It's trying to be helpful
[21:05:46] <Eviltwin> But can be misleading
[21:05:51] <bobdobbs> hm
[21:06:09] <Eviltwin> Does what you're seeing begin with a "?
[21:06:21] <bobdobbs> checking...
[21:06:42] <bobdobbs> when the code is within a function, no
[21:06:58] <bobdobbs> I'll test to see if I see that when the code is just in docready
[21:09:05] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/kmaJZ/
[21:09:17] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/kmaJZ/1/
[21:09:35] <Es0teric> why doesnt $('#divid').css({'display':'block'}); work for me?
[21:10:01] <bobdobbs> woah
[21:10:05] <bobdobbs> that was quick
[21:10:18] <bobdobbs> I've been trying to build this function for hours
[21:10:25] <Eviltwin> I'm a very capable programmer
[21:10:27] <avent> Eviltwin: Alright, here's what I came up with http://jsfiddle.net/FaZby/
[21:12:13] <Eviltwin> Do you see that stuff in red?
[21:12:15] <Eviltwin> In the HTML?
[21:12:51] <bobdobbs> me?
[21:12:55] <avent> yes I do
[21:13:07] <Eviltwin> That's where you're not closing the last tag you opened
[21:13:55] <avent> fixed
[21:14:34] <avent> http://jsfiddle.net/FaZby/2/
[21:14:38] <avent> also fixed a typo
[21:15:19] <Eviltwin> Fixed another issue: http://jsfiddle.net/FaZby/3/
[21:15:22] <Eviltwin> See if you can figure it out
[21:15:29] <Eviltwin> It's caused 90% of my jsFiddle problems
[21:16:08] <avent> alright, let's see
[21:16:35] <avent> excess spaces?
[21:16:46] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I did that for my own sanity
[21:17:05] <Eviltwin> It's not got anything to do with whitespace
[21:17:26] <avent> Just out of curiosity, how did you do that?
[21:17:34] <Eviltwin> TidyUp at the top
[21:18:00] <Eviltwin> Or, if you're not working in a fiddle, use http://jsbeautifier.org/
[21:18:16] <avent> Huh, smart
[21:18:24] <avent> And I can't figure out what you changed
[21:18:41] <Eviltwin> It's actually not in the code
[21:18:49] <avent> Oh!
[21:18:51] <avent> On the left
[21:18:54] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:19:02] <avent> Select jQuery
[21:19:05] <avent> Always gets me
[21:19:10] <avent> ahhhh! :P
[21:19:35] <avent> Now 1 last question
[21:20:07] <avent> Would you recommend I make a seperate js file and include it in the html document?
[21:20:18] <avent> would that be the most professional way to do it?
[21:20:31] <Eviltwin> It's a trade off
[21:20:38] <Eviltwin> When it's a lot of code, generally yes
[21:20:49] <Eviltwin> When the same code is used on many pages, always yess
[21:21:02] <Eviltwin> It's a trade off between the number of requests the browser has to make and cacheability
[21:21:28] <avent> Explain further please
[21:21:44] <Eviltwin> If the browser has to make more requests to load your page, it's going to take longer for all the pieces to come together (at least the first time)
[21:21:45] <avent> the request vs. cacheability part
[21:21:53] <avent> mhm
[21:22:14] <Eviltwin> However if the page is huge, it's going to take a while for the HTML to download, so nothing will be presented to the user
[21:22:32] <Eviltwin> And if you've copy/pasted the same code into a dozen different pages,
[21:22:38] <Eviltwin> That same code is going to be redownloaded each time
[21:22:43] <Eviltwin> Whereas if they all include the same JS file,
[21:22:54] <Eviltwin> That file is downloaded the first time and saved in the browser cache for subsequent requests
[21:23:02] <Eviltwin> So it takes basically 0 time to download that for subsequent requests
[21:23:17] <avent> So in my case, this JS is unique only to this one sell page
[21:23:26] <avent> Would you include it in the html doc then?
[21:23:30] <Eviltwin> Right, and it's also an extremely tiny amount of code
[21:23:34] <Eviltwin> So I'd just leave it in the page
[21:23:41] <Eviltwin> Big or reused -> separate file
[21:24:00] <avent> Okay
[21:24:08] <Eviltwin> Otherwise it's up to you
[21:24:10] <avent> <head> or bottom of the document?
[21:24:13] <Eviltwin> But it'll probably be faster to leave it in the page
[21:24:20] <Eviltwin> I always put it in the head
[21:24:30] <avent> alright :)
[21:24:31] <Eviltwin> I believe that takes less processing
[21:27:26] <joey55> its actually faster at the bottom
[21:27:38] <Eviltwin> What's faster?
[21:27:55] <Eviltwin> There are tradeoffs here
[21:27:56] <joey55> page loading
[21:28:52] <Eviltwin> Oh, true, it's CSS at the top and scripts at the bottom for older browsers
[21:29:17] <Eviltwin> But I think that's one of the smaller speedups
[21:29:21] <Eviltwin> Especially for this little script
[21:29:40] <joey55> I like it at the top usually because it tends to make things easier when including libraries and such, but sometimes I put it at the bottom
[21:30:07] <joey55> yea it's not a big enough difference in speed to always put it at the bottom
[21:30:50] <avent> so, my script works if I include it in the body, but not if I include it in the <head>
[21:30:59] <avent> any special precautions I need to take?
[21:31:02] <Eviltwin> avent: Have you used $(document).ready before?
[21:31:34] <avent> negative
[21:31:53] <Eviltwin> Okay if you put code inside $(document).ready(function(){...}) it will not be run until after the body has finished rendering
[21:32:05] <Eviltwin> Before the body has finished rendering, it's effectively empty
[21:32:24] <avent> Yep
[21:32:24] <Eviltwin> So those two .click's your binding, won't bind to anything because those elements don't exist yet
[21:32:35] <avent> Makes sense
[21:32:36] <Eviltwin> Sticking it inside the $(document).ready will fix that
[21:32:43] <avent> So before the addOne()'
[21:32:46] <Cork> Elephant: no thats load, ready triggers when the dom is constructed, but BEFORE its rendrered
[21:32:48] <avent> addOne();
[21:32:54] <avent> I will put the $(document).ready(function(){
[21:33:04] <Eviltwin> Cork: Is it actually before it's rendered or just before things like images are loaded?
[21:33:08] <Eviltwin> avent: Correct
[21:33:08] <avent> the functions can be declared outside, correct?
[21:33:11] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:33:15] <Cork> Eviltwin: before
[21:33:31] <Cork> Eviltwin: thats why you can modify things without flicker
[21:34:08] <joey55> I am trying to use jQuery draggable but I keep getting the error ".draggable is not a function". I have jquery UI included in the page. Any thoughts on this error message?
[21:34:26] <Eviltwin> joey55: Please construct a jsFiddle example
[21:35:03] <avent> Works perfectly: http://ubc-books.com/sell.html
[21:35:10] <avent> I'll keep the: $(this).val($(this).attr("name")); for now
[21:35:14] <avent> just for reference
[21:35:20] <Eviltwin> I don't recommend it in production
[21:35:23] <avent> Thanks so much Eviltwin
[21:35:26] <Eviltwin> You can comment it out
[21:35:33] <avent> Good idea
[21:36:08] <Eviltwin> "IMPORTANT: Make sure to double check all your entries, as they cannot be modified lateron"
[21:36:47] <Eviltwin> You should double check your text, I think you mean "later on" :P
[21:36:58] <avent> Haha
[21:37:00] <avent> Thanks
[21:37:14] <avent> 1 more question, final one I promise
[21:37:34] <avent> the "add book" and "remove book" are in <li>'s
[21:37:38] <joey55> here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/UPQKK/
[21:37:44] <avent> How can I prevent the linebreak after the <li>?
[21:38:06] <Cork> make it inline-block?
[21:38:26] <Cork> or float: left if you want support for old ie versions
[21:38:28] <avent> is that the only way?
[21:38:45] <Cork> the line break comes from the fact that its a block element
[21:39:52] <avent> is there an advantage of the inline-block over the float:left?
[21:39:57] <Eviltwin> joey55: Draggable isn't part of the base ui, you need to include it
[21:40:08] <Eviltwin> avent: It's actually inline, you can have text surrounding it
[21:40:16] <Cork> Eviltwin: depends on what you need to do
[21:40:36] <s34n> Is there an easy way to set an event for a node's creation?
[21:40:38] <Cork> Eviltwin: inline-block doesn't have the "i float so i shuffel things around" problem that float: left does
[21:40:42] <Eviltwin> s34n: Nope
[21:41:14] <Cork> Eviltwin: but on the other hand inline-block makes white space significant so you need to think about that
[21:41:27] <Cork> Eviltwin: so in other words, they both has there ups and downs
[21:42:16] <Eviltwin> joey55: Look at this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/default.html
[21:42:17] <Eviltwin> View the soure
[21:42:19] <Eviltwin> source
[21:43:35] <Eviltwin> Oh, I fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/UPQKK/1/
[21:43:45] <avent> Eviltwin, Cork: Works like a charm
[21:43:49] <avent> Thanks so much guys
[21:43:58] <Eviltwin> So do you know how to consume this in PHP?
[21:44:27] <avent> Not yet. That's for another day to learn
[21:44:27] <bobdobbs> I just discovered what has been messing me up. Turns out that I can only access the value of a variable if it's global.
[21:44:37] <avent> It's kind of a learn as you go project
[21:44:44] <joey55> I did include it, it still doesn't work. It works on here http://jsfiddle.net/UPQKK/
[21:44:46] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: No...you can only access it if it's in your scope
[21:44:54] <joey55> but I can't get it to work on my site
[21:44:56] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[21:45:06] <bobdobbs> ok
[21:45:17] <Eviltwin> joey55: Are you including jQuery UI before that line?
[21:45:22] <Es0teric> how do i call a function?
[21:45:29] <joey55> yes
[21:45:37] <Eviltwin> Is that line inside a $(document).ready ?
[21:46:03] <joey55> yea $(function() is the same thing
[21:46:28] <Eviltwin> Then I don't know what your problem is. Ask #jqueryui
[21:46:40] <joey55> have you ever used html5 boilerplate?
[21:46:43] <Eviltwin> Es0teric: Any function in particular?
[21:46:56] <Eviltwin> joey55: No, I write from scratch
[21:46:57] <Es0teric> Eviltwin, any function that has a name
[21:47:35] <joey55> haha there is 1 person in jqueryui
[21:48:47] <danheberden> this is support for ui too
[21:48:53] <Eviltwin> Es0teric: You define a function by doing function myFunctionName() { ... }
[21:48:58] <Eviltwin> You call it by doing myFunctionName()
[21:49:07] <Eviltwin> If you don't know how to do that...you're in for a world of pain
[21:49:11] <Es0teric> eviltwin, where do i call it?
[21:49:14] <danheberden> or var whatever = function(){}; whatever();
[21:49:24] <danheberden> or (function(){ /*will get ran */})();
[21:49:26] <Es0teric> i know in php you can either echo it or just do myFunctionName();
[21:49:42] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[21:50:00] <Es0teric> how do i call the function?
[21:50:10] <Eviltwin> myFunctionName()
[21:50:11] <danheberden> ?jqf @ Es0teric
[21:50:11] <bot-t> Es0teric, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[21:50:18] <danheberden> there's a section about functions
[21:50:25] <Es0teric> dude.. i know how to use jquery...
[21:50:29] <Es0teric> and i know how to code in js..
[21:50:34] <Es0teric> but i forgot how to call the function..
[21:50:37] <Es0teric> thats all i want to know for now
[21:51:18] <Eviltwin> Uh.......
[21:51:21] <Eviltwin> Okay.....
[21:51:34] <danheberden> that's like saying "i know how to drive, i just forgot how to depress the pedals"
[21:51:41] <danheberden> i'm not saying that to be a dick, btw
[21:51:46] <danheberden> just, like, maybe refresh a bit on some stuff
[21:51:57] <danheberden> and it'll make your life easier after going through some basic refresher course
[22:05:59] <avent> Good night guys
[22:06:09] <avent> See you around, I'm sure~
[22:37:04] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to pass a selected element to a function. Is there something wrong with this syntax? http://pastebin.com/PbfLdVfE
[22:37:42] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:37:52] <bobdobbs> what am I doing wrong?
[22:38:07] <Eviltwin> I presume you intend to do myfunc(target)
[22:39:07] <Eviltwin> this is a very special reserved word
[22:40:05] <bobdobbs> My assumption in the snippet is that 'this' points to target
[22:40:20] <Eviltwin> You don't show a function call
[22:40:33] <Eviltwin> You show a function definition but you don't show a function call
[22:40:44] <bobdobbs> oh
[22:40:49] <bobdobbs> thanks
[22:40:58] <Eviltwin> So it's not clear what you're trying to do
[22:41:35] <bobdobbs> yeah thats it. I just didn't call the actual function. doh.
[22:41:44] <Eviltwin> Well
[22:41:49] <Eviltwin> That's part of it :P
[22:42:01] <bobdobbs> oh crap. theres more ?
[22:42:16] <Eviltwin> It depends on what you're trying to do
[22:42:20] <Eviltwin> Which is why I wanted to see the function call
[22:42:47] <bobdobbs> I'm just trying to doSomething() to whatever I pass to the function.
[22:43:16] <Eviltwin> Have you coded JavaScript before?
[22:43:23] <Eviltwin> JavaScript functions
[22:43:31] <bobdobbs> yeah. but not for a while.
[22:44:25] <bobdobbs> most of the time when I work with js, I'm just implementing effects using plugins.
[22:44:25] <Eviltwin> So function sum(a,b){return a+b;} and sum(2,3)
[22:44:49] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:44:52] <Eviltwin> What are those
[22:46:30] <Eviltwin> What does the first thing do and what does the second thing do?
[22:47:22] <bobdobbs> first thing defines a function, second thing calls the function on two objects?
[22:48:35] <Eviltwin> Where'd you get objects from?
[22:48:48] <Eviltwin> Or are you just using that as a generic term for something
[22:49:11] <bobdobbs> yeah, I was just about to ask if they were 'objects' or not.
[22:49:34] <bobdobbs> I guess it's safer to just say numbers
[22:50:07] <Eviltwin> Do you know what the return thing means?
[22:50:27] <bobdobbs> I think so. It gives something back out of the function
[22:50:33] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:51:09] <Es0teric> i have a lights off script that i need help with.. so when i click on the div to activate the lights off, it fades in, but to click it again, it doesnt fade out
[22:51:10] <Eviltwin> It sounds like you're at the "dangerous" level of knowledge
[22:51:15] <bobdobbs> hehe
[22:51:29] <Eviltwin> You know enough that you can cobble things together with trial and error but don't really know what's going on inside
[22:51:31] <bobdobbs> "drink deep or touch not..."
[22:51:42] <bobdobbs> story of my life
[22:52:15] <Eviltwin> So do you know what $("div") means?
[22:53:25] <bobdobbs> I think so. It is something inside the thing that an instance of jquery, that refers to a set. In this case, the set is all things that are a div.
[22:53:34] <bobdobbs> ah, sorry.
[22:53:39] <bobdobbs> I mashed the sentance.
[22:53:42] <bobdobbs> I'll try again...
[22:54:23] <bobdobbs> I think $("div") is a set of things, representing everything in the DOM that is a div.
[22:55:07] <Eviltwin> You're mostly correct
[22:55:14] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:55:26] <Eviltwin> It is the set of everything in the DOM that is a div right now
[22:55:31] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:55:39] <Eviltwin> If you add or remove divs, this set will not change
[22:55:50] <bobdobbs> I see
[22:56:04] <FearMoth> is there any way to animate an element with an interval to fire the animation at, rather than a time for the animation to span?
[22:56:33] <Eviltwin> Now you've probably seen things like $("div").hide()
[22:56:40] <bobdobbs> yep
[22:56:58] <Eviltwin> And maybe even things like $("div").not(":first").last().hide()
[22:57:05] <bobdobbs> yeo
[22:57:07] <bobdobbs> yep.
[22:57:21] <bobdobbs> I think I can even tell what that means.
[22:57:21] <Eviltwin> This is because jQuery supports chaining
[22:57:40] <bobdobbs> yep. I think I kinda understand chaining too.
[22:57:43] <Eviltwin> All of the functions above return a jQuery object (a collection of elements)
[22:57:53] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:58:31] <Eviltwin> That is shorthand for var a = $("div"); var b = a.not(":first"); var c = b.last(); c.hide();
[22:58:48] <Eviltwin> Rather than storing those collections in variables and acting on them
[22:58:55] <Eviltwin> You can just act on them directly
[22:59:11] <bobdobbs> I see.
[22:59:14] <bobdobbs> (I think)
[22:59:37] <bobdobbs> yeah, I kind of get it. Chaining is a convenience for programmers?
[22:59:40] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:59:54] <Eviltwin> Notice how much shorter the other version is
[23:00:00] <bobdobbs> indeed
[23:00:15] <Eviltwin> So now lets say we want to write a function
[23:00:19] <Eviltwin> And the function will take an argument
[23:00:26] <Eviltwin> Or parameter
[23:00:31] <Eviltwin> Or whatever terminology you're familiar with
[23:00:40] <Eviltwin> (a or b in my sum function above)
[23:00:53] <Eviltwin> That argument will be a jQuery collection
[23:01:03] <Eviltwin> And you want to hide everything in that collection
[23:01:03] <bobdobbs> ok
[23:01:17] <bobdobbs> hide it for convenience's sake?
[23:01:20] <Eviltwin> A call like var target=$("div"); hideAll(target);
[23:01:26] <Eviltwin> Or hideAll($("div"))
[23:01:31] <Eviltwin> To hide all of the divs on the page
[23:01:36] <bobdobbs> yep
[23:01:48] <Eviltwin> Your function will be defined function hideAll(a) { a.hide(); }
[23:01:57] <Eviltwin> Or hideAll(foobar) { foobar.hide(); }
[23:02:08] <Eviltwin> function hideAll(foobar) { foobar.hide(); } *
[23:02:42] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[23:02:48] <bobdobbs> brain catching up...
[23:03:10] <bobdobbs> hey - I'll be back in 60secs...
[23:04:37] <bobdobbs> ok., back
[23:04:55] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: I'm just going to write that example down on paper, so I get it...
[23:05:11] <Eviltwin> A function definition defines some variables that the caller sends to it
[23:06:17] <Eviltwin> What doesn't make senes?
[23:06:19] <Eviltwin> sense*
[23:06:21] <bobdobbs> ok, Ill compare that to my example from before...
[23:06:42] <Eviltwin> (I've been coding since I was like 10 so this stuff is like part of my DNA)
[23:06:54] <bobdobbs> cool
[23:07:02] <Eviltwin> I sometimes suck at explaining the basics
[23:07:08] <bobdobbs> I'm kind of a slow learner
[23:07:11] <Eviltwin> Since it's just second nature to me
[23:07:42] <Eviltwin> Have you done math with functions?
[23:07:44] <Eviltwin> Like f(x)=y
[23:07:49] <Eviltwin> Err
[23:07:52] <Eviltwin> f(x)=x^2
[23:07:54] <bobdobbs> no. I'm crap at math.
[23:08:05] <bobdobbs> But I think I can ready the first of those two examples.
[23:08:06] <Eviltwin> You were talking about sets so I had hopes :P
[23:08:14] <bobdobbs> hehe
[23:08:43] <bobdobbs> Does the first one say "y = what comes out of x when you run it through f"?
[23:09:06] <Eviltwin> Which thing?
[23:09:41] <Eviltwin> f(x)=y?
[23:09:47] <Eviltwin> That's a bad example
[23:09:50] <bobdobbs> ok
[23:10:03] <Eviltwin> But since we're talking math
[23:10:06] <Eviltwin> Consider f(x)=x^2
[23:10:14] <Es0teric> ok, i have this -> http://pastie.org/private/q3b7krxkcvztvpr7ah7ihw how do i make it so it toggles it on/off when the $toggleLight is clicked?
[23:10:15] <Eviltwin> That's defininf the function
[23:10:21] <bobdobbs> ok
[23:10:38] <Eviltwin> What would f(2) be?
[23:10:58] <bobdobbs> 2^2
[23:11:02] <bobdobbs> ?
[23:11:03] <Eviltwin> 4
[23:11:08] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:11:15] <bobdobbs> cool
[23:11:22] <Eviltwin> Functions in programming follow kind of the same idea
[23:11:27] <Eviltwin> You define a function that takes some variables
[23:11:33] <Eviltwin> Then at some point you evalute the function
[23:11:35] <Eviltwin> You use it
[23:11:39] <bobdobbs> ok
[23:11:47] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript this would be function f(x) { return x*x; }
[23:11:55] <bobdobbs> right
[23:11:59] <Eviltwin> And if you called it with f(2), you would get back 4
[23:12:05] <bobdobbs> right
[23:12:37] <Eviltwin> Now functions can take more than one argument if needed, so you could also do: function s(a,b) { return a+b; }
[23:12:44] <Eviltwin> s(2,3) would return 5
[23:13:01] <bobdobbs> I see.
[23:13:19] <bobdobbs> I think I see what I did wrong with my example now.
[23:13:25] <Eviltwin> JavaScript functions can take more than just numbers
[23:13:35] <Eviltwin> For example a jQuery object/set/collection
[23:14:05] <bobdobbs> ok
[23:14:37] <Eviltwin> Remember how I told you that $("div").hide() and var a=$("div");a.hide() do the same thing?
[23:14:48] <Eviltwin> You could also have a hiding function
[23:15:03] <Eviltwin> function hideIt(a) { a.hide(); }
[23:15:08] <Eviltwin> And call hideIt($("div"))
[23:15:17] <lng> hi! anybody familiar with jQuery Mobile? When link is clicked, page slides and undefined is printed. What is that?
[23:15:21] <Eviltwin> what happens is first JavaScript does $("div")
[23:15:27] <Eviltwin> And creates the collection of all divs in the DOM
[23:15:35] <Eviltwin> Then that collection gets passed to hideIt as the first parameter
[23:15:44] <bobdobbs> brain catching up...
[23:15:47] <Eviltwin> Then hideIt takes its first parameter and calls .hide() on it
[23:16:41] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: Is this better? : http://pastebin.com/vSd9wVVw
[23:16:54] <Eviltwin> Nope
[23:16:55] <bobdobbs> oh wait...
[23:17:00] <bobdobbs> sorry, try again...
[23:17:22] <Eviltwin> New link?
[23:17:43] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.com/vpbjTYzf
[23:17:50] <Eviltwin> Closer
[23:18:03] <Eviltwin> You'll notice none of my examples had anything to do with "this"
[23:18:17] <bobdobbs> ah. ok.
[23:19:04] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.com/index/vpbjTYzf
[23:19:21] <Eviltwin> I still see a this in there
[23:19:29] <bobdobbs> ah. damn. I messed up the paste...
[23:19:56] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.com/pAD3rM9q
[23:20:02] <Eviltwin> Perfect
[23:20:07] <bobdobbs> yay!
[23:20:20] <bobdobbs> *dances jig
[23:20:28] <nostar> im using live() to watch for a change event on a single radio element. If, while this element is :checked, I click on one of the other radio buttons, shouldn't change event fire for becoming unchecked as well?
[23:20:54] <Eviltwin> nostar: That's a good question
[23:21:16] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: thanks for being patient with me. I'm going to take a break, then I'm gonna come back and lurk.
[23:21:26] <Eviltwin> I'm going to go to sleep
[23:21:26] <Cork> nostar: as far as i remember no it dosn't
[23:21:41] <nostar> it doesnt though unless im doing something wrong.  I only get the event when I click on it, so whats the difference from the click event?
[23:21:41] <bobdobbs> Sooner or later, I'll get past continually shooting my toes off :)
[23:21:51] <Cork> nostar: you get a change on the other radio button but not the one that loses check
[23:22:10] <Cork> nostar: its cause they act like the same big object
[23:22:19] <nostar> Cork click does the same thing right?
[23:22:23] <Cork> nostar: check boxes trigger for both check and uncheck
[23:22:29] <Cork> nostar: yes
[23:23:03] <Cork> nostar: even more so cause if you programatically change state click doesn't trigger (as in not through click)
[23:25:02] <nostar> Cork but for radios, isn't it broken that change acts like click?  A previously :checked radio button changed state when another radio of the same group was clicked.  Or prgrammatically sure it should fire then too.
[23:26:09] <Eviltwin> It does almost feel backwards
[23:26:19] <Eviltwin> It's firing for when they become checked
[23:26:20] <nostar> well to get back to work i have to watch all radio buttons of a group to get an event when the one I want to know about becomes uncheck right?
[23:26:50] <Eviltwin> $("input[type=radio]").live("change",function() {
[23:26:59] <Cork> nostar: just watch the name element
[23:27:08] <Eviltwin> $("input[type=radio]:checked")
[23:27:08] <Eviltwin> ?
[23:27:14] <Eviltwin> That too
[23:27:15] <Cork> no won't work
[23:27:57] <Cork> $('input[type="radio"][name="opt_field_name"]').live("change",function() { });
[23:30:26] <Cork> nostar: http://jsfiddle.net/7DnzR/
[23:32:04] <nostar> Cork im more interested in seeing a response from the radio that *lost* the check
[23:32:34] <nostar> that site is cool btw
[23:33:32] <Eviltwin> There's no way to have jQuery append a text node with a specified string, right?
[23:36:37] <nostar> i think i get it, i need to look at radios a little differently.
[23:56:14] <mrskman> good morning :-)
