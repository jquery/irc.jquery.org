[00:05:03] <dblosevn> RWOverdijk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279809/global-custom-events-in-jquery
[00:05:36] <Cork> RWOverdijk: as far as i know you can't
[00:06:00] <Cork> RWOverdijk: you send the value as arguments
[00:06:07] <dblosevn> event.trigger takes a context param?
[00:06:34] <Cork> i have to dig in the code
[00:06:37] <RWOverdijk> It should be possible.
[00:06:40] <RWOverdijk> jquery does it.
[00:06:53] <Cork> but as far as i remember it sends the second argument as arguments
[00:07:05] <RWOverdijk> awesome, context.
[00:08:25] <Cork> RWOverdijk: its the third argument
[00:08:30] <Cork> trigger: function( event, data, elem
[00:08:45] <RWOverdijk> Cork, You're awesome.
[00:08:54] <Cork> $.event.trigger('customer-event', ['data'], $this)
[00:09:55] <RWOverdijk> Yes
[00:11:49] <Cork> dblosevn: all i can say is that i find no reference in the code to data.context
[00:26:58] <RWOverdijk> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/e2xuw/
[00:27:03] <RWOverdijk> That doesn't seem to work
[00:27:33] <Cork> ah, you're running it on an empty object
[00:27:44] <Cork> thats another caller, one sec need to check that one
[00:27:58] <Cork> (the one i talked about was $.event.trigger)
[00:28:33] <Cork> nope $() sets the event target
[00:28:34] <RWOverdijk> Yeah, I want to make objects that support events, handling elements. So tabRender would fire with the tab element as "this" context
[00:28:49] <RWOverdijk> ahw
[00:28:53] <Cork> so you can't control the this variable through $().trigger
[00:29:09] <RWOverdijk> That's a shame..
[00:29:30] <Cork> RWOverdijk: http://jsfiddle.net/e2xuw/1/
[00:29:38] <Cork> that doesn't work for you?
[00:29:56] <RWOverdijk> Nope
[00:30:01] <RWOverdijk> console remains empty
[00:30:27] <RWOverdijk> But now it's triggering on jquery right, so the target is different
[00:30:55] <Cork> well it triggers on all bound event listeners in jquery
[00:31:40] <RWOverdijk> I did not know that.
[00:31:51] <Cork> ah, the third element defines what element it will trigger on
[00:32:01] <RWOverdijk> ha
[00:32:11] <Cork> so it will trigger on the new div :)
[00:33:27] <RWOverdijk> That's useful haha
[00:34:11] <RWOverdijk> I could proxy it
[00:35:12] <Cork> best option is prob so send it has an argument to the event handler
[00:35:26] <Cork> that will be more future sae
[00:35:28] <Cork> *safe
[00:36:36] <RWOverdijk> Yeah I guess...
[00:36:43] <RWOverdijk> Setting the this context just seemed prettier
[00:37:20] <Cork> RWOverdijk: jquery-ui sends it has an "ui" object as the first argument
[00:37:27] <Cork> and i think its a good idea
[00:37:44] <RWOverdijk> Well, alright then :)
[00:37:48] <RWOverdijk> Thank you Cork
[00:38:21] <Cork> RWOverdijk: though i would personally prefer to use a dom element and bind it to that
[00:38:38] <Cork> the generic event trigger has the upper hand that it can be any element in the dom :)
[00:38:53] <RWOverdijk> Cork, I understand, but the structure of my application is a bit different than usual.
[00:39:33] <Cork> RWOverdijk: i understand, but theres often a way to do it that way anyway
[00:39:53] <Cork> it has the advantage of less risk of leaking listeners
[00:40:34] <RWOverdijk> Cork, Everything has its own place, it's a ton of different smaller files, and it's all set up object oriented. So these tabs get created dynamically, and I want to do something to them "on create". I could getTab(), but that's already an extra step
[00:41:07] <RWOverdijk> And I'm actually keeping track of listeners in a counter, so when it's leaking I'll know.
[00:41:24] <RWOverdijk> But thank you for your comment, it's a good one
[00:54:54] <dblosevn> what am i missing, is there no way to set the default button in a ui dialog?
[00:55:31] <Bheam> hi.. i'm adding a form field within a form, but it doesn't get submitted? it works in ie9 but not in ie10/chrome/firefox

[00:56:26] <bot-t> dblosevn, Couldn't find "demo Bheam" in jQuery Docs.
[00:56:33] <dblosevn> we
[01:11:10] <Qdest> Anyone able to take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/aakBx/11/ and help me? I need to be able to call dropHide() within the .mouseleave() somehow. Not entirely sure how! Also I'd like some input on how to make the buttons "spammable" with .stop(true). Thanks!
[01:19:13] <RWOverdijk> Cork, Just wanted to let you know that I slightly changed my code. I've removed the custom events and am now using a third argument for the create method :)

[01:59:33] <sehh> hey people
[01:59:44] <sehh> does the new jQuery 1.9 support a horizontal menu?
[02:00:09] <sehh> because I can't find anything in the docs on how to change the 'menu' widget to display horizontaly
[02:07:16] <Whirl3d> are you talking about jquery UI?
[02:09:00] <sehh> yes, jquery ui 1.9
[02:09:06] <sehh> sorry for that
[02:10:25] <Whirl3d> I bet thisis going to be a css thing. You probably have to float your menu items left or something
[02:13:12] <sehh> only if I make modifications to the UI's css, which won't help when I upgrade to a newer version in the future
[02:13:27] <sehh> I googled a bit and people are talking about a "menu" and a "menubar" widget
[02:13:45] <sehh> it appears the "menubar" widget has dissappeared...
[02:14:02] <sehh> hmm
[02:14:08] <sehh> probably removed from this release...
[02:19:44] <Whirl3d> yeah. Menu doesn't quite look ready for primetime. I think it prefers to be a second class citicizen for now
[02:19:57] <computer2000> whats the best method to check an integer e.g. "50%" to see if it is a percentage?
[02:20:12] <computer2000> ah, i mean a string
[02:20:39] <Whirl3d> a string that represents a percentage?
[02:21:57] <computer2000> Whirl3d: yes
[02:22:20] <Whirl3d> String.prototype.isPercentage=function () {if (this.substr(-1,1))==="%" return true; return false;}   ---probably the worst way to do it .LOL
[02:24:07] <computer2000> Whirl3d: thx, well it would work i guess
[02:24:15] <Whirl3d> problem entries are gonna be like 50%. or 40.3%  or .34% or .34 of 50 pct or 50 percent
[02:25:24] <Whirl3d> to do it right, you'd have to sanitize your source, break it down into its pieces and verify that some percent identifier existed at the end of the clean string...
[02:27:36] <Whirl3d> i'm sure I could come up with a downright UGLY regex for ya. LOL
[02:30:07] <c3l> how can I extend the event object to include mosePos = [pageX, pageY] and mouseRelPos to hold the position relative the particular element? Is it a bad idea to do this?
[02:31:01] <chovy> anyone know a plugin that will do confirm() ?
[02:31:27] <Whirl3d> chovy, what do you mean by confirm()?
[02:34:05] <chovy> native js
[02:34:09] <chovy> confirm() dialog
[02:34:19] <chovy> i guess jquery-ui has one
[02:34:29] <chovy> not to kean on loading jquery-ui though
[02:34:44] <NodeX> do you mean prettifying a confirm box?
[02:35:13] <chovy> yes

[03:43:03] <tcberner> ah, my id 'button_del_0.0' was not a good name it seems ^^

[03:54:07] <blackspotwiggins> maybe - needs to be escaped
[03:59:54] <xec_> Guest35142: i think you need to be more specific. are you checking a single character? are you extracting part of a string? or validating?

If it's an integer, set it to that, if it's true, use default.disappear value.
[04:15:41] <pifantastic> Qdest: typeof disappear === 'number'
[04:15:52] <pifantastic> ohh
[04:15:54] <pifantastic> it's a string?
[04:16:18] <Qdest> could be as well, can't expect ppl to do disappear: 300 vs. '300' and also it should take true/false
[04:16:22] <pifantastic> ?eval true

[04:28:16] <Pingless> good morning all
[04:28:42] <Pingless> I've got a constructor function with a function inside it (this.adjust = function(){} ...). This constructor function calls $(window).scroll(this.adjust), which should register this.adjust as a callback for the window scroll event. But when I scroll, the adjust function never gets called. Any ideas why?
[04:29:45] <shaun__> Hello all, I have some xml that looks like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

[04:29:49] <shaun__> </Bundle>
[04:30:01] <shaun__> how can i select the attribute server time ?
[04:30:28] <shaun__> have tried: $("Bundle>key[servertime]",window.xmlDoc).attr('servertime');
[04:30:47] <shaun__> window.xmlDoc is the xml ;)
[04:31:12] <pifantastic> shaun__: $("Bundle key[servertime]",window.xmlDoc).attr('servertime');
[04:32:33] <pifantastic> Pingless: just a sec
[04:32:36] <shaun__> pifantastic - thats works - thanks
[04:34:42] <pifantastic> Pingless: http://jsfiddle.net/UdPMa/2/
[04:34:47] <pifantastic> Pingless: is that what you're doing?
[04:35:43] <c3l> how can I extend the event object to include mosePos = [pageX, pageY] and mouseRelPos to hold the position relative the particular element? Is it a bad idea to do this?
[04:36:43] <Pingless> pifantastic: No, it's this: http://jsfiddle.net/gfdcU/
[04:38:02] <pifantastic> Pingless: save it
[04:38:14] <pifantastic> Pingless: because you just linked the exact same thing I linked you
[04:38:19] <Pingless> sorry.
[04:38:40] <Pingless> http://jsfiddle.net/gfdcU/1/
[04:39:59] <pifantastic> Pingless: it gets called, but this.value is undefined, because it's not properly scoped
[04:40:19] <Pingless> yeah I've realised that after the nice folks from ##javascript sent me here :)
[04:40:43] <pifantastic> Pingless: http://jsfiddle.net/LeArt/1/
[04:41:37] <Pingless> pifantastic: thanks for that solution; do you know why that is necessary? And if there's a nicer way of scoping it correctly?
[04:42:28] <pifantastic> Pingless: it's hard to explain over IRC, but you should research scope in JavaScript, it's important
[04:42:43] <pifantastic> Pingless: and using $.proxy is a good pattern
[04:43:02] <Pingless> okay - thanks for that :)
[04:43:41] <pifantastic> Pingless: an alternative: http://jsfiddle.net/LeArt/2/
[04:43:51] <pifantastic> Pingless: but I think it's less elegant than using $.proxy

[05:04:07] <Crumbz> Hey guys. I have a working function (tested works initially for click events) that i wish to rebind to a ul after an ajax call using: $('nav > ul').on('change', bindNavEvents);   - does this look right to you?
[05:16:49] <aga> Hello all!
[05:17:23] <aga> Doing $('label[for="nightDrivingIssuer"]') gives me label#ext-gen576.x-form-item-label but when I apply .show() it doesn't show it.
[05:17:51] <aga> what does show() do? I have the label element hidden by default with CSS: display: none;
[05:19:10] <Saaether> ? show
[05:19:11] <bot-t> .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[05:19:51] <aga> ok thanks, but the .show() function won't show the element
[05:20:41] <Saaether> do you have a jsfiddle setup to we can see the code?
[05:20:49] <Saaether> so*
[05:21:47] <Saaether> ?demo @ aga

[05:22:41] <Lee-Lee> Hi guys, what is the best way to trigger change event on a div with "contentEditable"?
[05:22:47] <Crumbz> anyone know why the 'change' event does not trigger here? https://gist.github.com/3993325
[05:23:05] <Crumbz> same problem with me Lee-Lee :P
[05:23:47] <Lee-Lee> Crumbz: yup.. apparently only works on form elements
[05:24:16] <Crumbz> Well that sucks..
[05:24:47] <aga> Saaether: I really can't since this is a company project I am working on. I just noticed that when I set the display to none with CSS for the label with !important, it won't me to use .show()
[05:25:04] <aga> once I remove the !important flag from the style definition it works :/
[05:39:05] <aga> no one knows the issue I have?
[05:50:20] <sunbeam> hi, i've got a responsive site, using media queries, but for some reason when using an iphone, when the mobile device is rotated from portrait to landscape, it doesn't update the widths (100%)
[05:50:27] <sunbeam> I mean, it doesn't update the widths
[05:50:35] <sunbeam> Is there a way to detect when that rotation takes place
[05:51:19] <Zogot> sunbeam: you are missing the <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
[05:51:32] <Zogot> put that in head
[05:54:16] <Trisox> how would one unbind all events on a link?
[05:54:30] <Trisox> Cork: ?
[05:54:59] <pifantastic> Trisox: To remove specific delegated event handlers, provide a selector argument. The selector string must exactly match the one passed to .on() when the event handler was attached. To remove all delegated events from an element without removing non-delegated events, use the special value "**".
[05:55:22] <pifantastic> Trisox: $('foo').off('**')
[05:55:32] <Trisox> hmm right
[06:02:34] <sunbeam> Zogot: i have that
[06:02:35] <sunbeam> in head
[06:06:42] <sunbeam> Zogot: here?
[06:07:54] <Zogot> sunbeam: Exactly like mine?
[06:10:18] <Zogot> sunbeam: If the one I pasted didn't work, try this one <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1" /> after this I can't help you, you could always implement a JS solution
[06:12:51] <sunbeam> sec
[06:13:45] <sunbeam> do you have got an iphone?
[06:14:35] <sunbeam> Zogot: i ment, that when i rotate portrait -> landscape, and back again
[06:14:52] <sunbeam> when i switch from portrait to landspace everything stays ok
[06:15:14] <Zogot> sunbeam: Shouldn't matter from which to which (or back again)
[06:28:03] <sunbeam> nvm it seems that this is some issue related to iphone
[06:28:43] <sunbeam> how can i test if the device a page is displayed on, is an iphone?
[06:46:50] <DannyZB> guys a question : what qt addon that doesn't exist would you find useful ? (QT/PHP)
[06:48:40] <grom> DannyZB: what is qt?
[06:48:58] <DannyZB> JQUERY i mean ><
[06:49:13] <DannyZB> any idea that uses jquery/php/ajax
[06:49:19] <DannyZB> or pure jQuery
[06:50:59] <wide288> i use validate, add <tr> row, switch (element) case "row_name[]" ,but first well done , second don't work.

[06:56:06] <dpy> hi guys
[06:57:38] <dpy> anyone here using chrome 23 (beta) ??   It seems that they are changing the console.log (etc.) code...    console.log("Divs: ", $('div').slice(0, 20)) no longer prints the nice and highlightable array of elements
[06:57:46] <dpy> instead you get something like this:
[06:57:56] <dpy> [<div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, <div>, prevObject: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[154], context: #document, selector: "div.slice(10,20)"]
[06:57:56] <swe_ET> I have an jquery wrapped <select> and want to query for the <option> with value = 'a' , how do I do that ?
[07:05:02] <dpy> lol, there are 866 people here, who probably do not have a clue what the latest chrome/chromium devtools have in store for them... :-s
[07:06:29] <sunbeam> A question, for some reason a light blue transparent background displays in a different color on an iphone
[07:06:32] <sunbeam> does anyone know how that's possible
[07:08:38] <Guest10876> Can anyone give a quick hand with calling non-anonymous functions inside jQuery's ajax method?
[07:09:04] <Guest10876> I've created this fiddle = http://jsfiddle.net/BBe93/6/ Is it possible to call a non-anon function with the ajax "success" method?
[07:09:59] <dpy> Guest10876:
[07:10:15] <dpy> success: function() {twitterSuccess(data)}
[07:10:43] <dpy> because of the argument you have to wrap it in a closure (which the above function is used as)
[07:12:01] <dpy> oh, and I presume that data is the result data?  then it should be: function(data) {twitterSuccess(data)}
[07:30:09] <Guest10876> dpy: thanks!
[07:33:16] <dpy> Guest10876: np
[07:36:47] <shoky> or just..  success: twitterSuccess
[07:40:48] <shoky> dpy: $('div').slice(..) returns a jquery object, not an array. chrome is just being more accurate now in what it shows you
[07:41:02] <shoky> dpy: if you want to see an array, do  $('div').slice(...).get()
[07:42:10] <dpy> shoky: doesn't work either, it'll just give: [<div>, <div>, ...]
[07:42:16] <dpy> nothing highlightable
[07:43:18] <dpy> the only way it seems to be working is if you do: console.log("[%o, %o, %o, ..]", ...get(0), ...get(1), ...get(2))
[07:43:39] <shoky> ah the highlight
[07:43:45] <dpy> shoky: but I'm open to suggestions
[07:44:05] <shoky> you mean when it lets you inspect that element?
[07:44:16] <shoky> ah hightlight on the page duh.
[07:44:18] <dpy> highlight, clickable, dom-node-traversable
[07:44:21] <dpy> yes
[07:44:28] <dpy> collapsable
[07:44:31] <dpy> etc.
[07:45:03] <dpy> it still supports DOM nodes
[07:45:07] <shoky> well, as long as it still works fine for 1 element, i'm not worried too much ;P
[07:45:17] <dpy> but no array-like objects returning DOM nodes for indices
[07:51:41] <adlwalrus> hi, all. I'm trying to translate a jquery plugin into another framework.  but its throwing exceptions out of control! here is the code:  http://jsbin.com/itahif/1/edit (open up your console and mouseover the blue.) and the original... https://gist.github.com/3987197#file_original_jquery_plugin.js
[07:51:52] <adlwalrus> could anyone tell me why?
[07:54:56] <HelpME> Hello Guys i need some :-)
[07:55:04] <RLaa> how to combine class and contains selector in sizzle?
[07:55:32] <RLaa> tried to use '.class:contains("text")' but "not working"
[07:55:48] <RLaa> return array of arrays or something like that
[07:55:55] <RLaa> so i must be using it wrong
[07:56:08] <Hopsy> How do I return a $.fn. function?
[07:56:38] <Guest56490> I have this in a for loop      $('#dialog1').append("<div id ='prevJourney"+ count + "'>" + claimJourneyId + claimJourneyDesc + "</div>" );
[07:56:56] <NoiseEee> RLaa: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/
[07:56:56] <Guest56490> I want to add a click event to each div when i generate it
[07:57:26] <Guest56490> i tryed
[07:57:27] <Guest56490>        $(clickDib).click(function () {                                 alert(claimJourneyId);                                               });
[07:57:39] <RLaa> NoiseEee, looks fine according to it
[07:57:42] <NoiseEee> Guest56490: stop now please
[07:57:51] <Guest56490> :(
[07:57:55] <RLaa> NoiseEee, tho :contains is not in CSS3
[07:58:13] <NoiseEee> RLaa: right, so use a CSS3 selector to get what you want. you're looking for a class containing a certain string?
[07:58:29] <NoiseEee> elements with a class with a certain string, that is?
[07:58:33] <RLaa> yes
[07:59:15] <RLaa> there is no css3 selector for text contents as i see
[07:59:24] <NoiseEee> $('[class*="searchForMe"]').  Third one on that list.
[07:59:45] <shoky> Hopsy: whatcha mean
[07:59:56] <RLaa> oh wait, no, i meant element that contains specific text and has that class
[08:00:27] <NoiseEee> RLaa: searching for an element with certain text is rather nasty/expensive
[08:00:44] <NoiseEee> RLaa: you should search for class first if you can, then try to regex the text
[08:01:03] <Hopsy> shoky:  $.fn.extend({ test: function() { return 'test; } );  $('#test').test();
[08:01:05] <Hopsy> this
[08:01:12] <Hopsy> is what I mean
[08:01:34] <RLaa> NoiseEee, this is part of a small testing code, so computational cost is not an issue
[08:01:40] <shoky> Guest56490: var div = $('<div..>..</div>'); $('#dialog1').append(div); div.click(function() { ... });
[08:02:02] <RLaa> and i would have expect sizzle to optimize by searching by class first
[08:02:15] <NoiseEee> RLaa: Sizzle works with classes, not with element content
[08:02:47] <NoiseEee> if any part of your app/script relies on finding by content primarily, its the wrong way to do it
[08:02:50] <shoky> Hopsy: you want the function to return a reference to itself..?
[08:02:56] <RLaa> NoiseEee, documentation has ":contains(TEXT): Finds all elements whose textual context contains the word 'TEXT' (case sensitive)."
[08:03:02] <Hopsy> indeed
[08:03:06] <shoky> Hopsy: why?
[08:03:22] <shoky> Hopsy:  var functionRef = $('#test').test;  there you have your reference
[08:03:27] <Hopsy> I want to see text on <div id="test"></div>
[08:04:02] <RLaa> NoiseEee, it's for testing, to select the clickable area, assigning ids for elements or using verbose xpath for testing is just stupid
[08:04:21] <Hopsy> ow wait :')
[08:04:24] <Hopsy> neverminddd
[08:05:52] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/ee4gD/ @ RLaa
[08:06:12] <NoiseEee> RLaa: so maybe JS fiddle what isn't working for you?
[08:06:40] <RLaa> NoiseEee, it works perfectly
[08:07:04] <RLaa> sec, inspecting what sizzle actually returns here
[08:07:26] <RLaa> in the fiddle it's array of elements, but i have array of arrays
[08:07:50] <Heather_> could someone help me with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13179528/altering-bootstrap-dropdown-js
[08:09:32] <Guest56490> shoky: var div = $('<div id="count"> ' + claimJourneyId + '</div>'); $('#dialog1').append(div); div.click(function() { alert(claimJourneyId); });
[08:10:07] <Guest56490> shoky: its adding them in fine etc. But assigning clickeven all to the last id in the for loop
[08:13:22] <RLaa> NoiseEee, thanks, the selector code is working fine
[08:15:43] <granden> Can I scroll a user to a certain point?
[08:15:46] <granden> in pixels.
[08:16:24] <xec_>  granden: have you seen http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[08:19:13] <granden> xec_: No, but seams really nice. Will give it a try.
[08:19:15] <granden> Thanks!
[08:19:18] <xec_> yw :)
[08:26:59] <Taar779_w> Is it possible to extend an already existing jQuery object? Say I wanted to add some functionality to .on?
[08:33:04] <seutje> Taar779_w: suppose you could override $.fn.on
[08:34:21] <Taar779_w> seutje: I don't want to override it, I just want to extend it so it behaves in a different manner.
[08:34:46] <Taar779_w> I'm just not sure how to go about this without making it too complex or messy
[08:35:56] <granden> xec_: This is strange, getting some error message trying to use that scrollTo
[08:36:01] <granden> jquery.min.js:2TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'p.easing[this.easing](a,this.options.duration*a,0,1,this.options.duration)') in the console...
[08:36:31] <xec_> granden: are you using jquery ui?
[08:36:54] <CathaliN> hello!
[08:37:16] <granden> xec_: Woops, does it need jquery ui. Hmm no :)
[08:37:45] <seutje> Taar779_w: var _on = $.fn.on; $.fn.on = function() {  /*yada yada*/ _on.call(this, arguments); } ?
[08:37:47] <xec_> granden: jquery ui includes easing options. without it you only have two available
[08:37:47] <CathaliN> I have a combobox.. how can I store (keep) the value of an selected item until I select another item?
[08:38:30] <granden> xec_: Ok, so which parts of jquery ui do I need?
[08:38:32] <jacobroufa_> hey room
[08:38:33] <xec_> granden:  "linear" and "swing" i thinnk
[08:38:42] <Eviltwin> I prefer $.fn.on = (function(on) { /* yada yada */ on.call(this, arguments); })($.fn.on);
[08:39:00] <Eviltwin> For scope
[08:39:10] <granden> xec_: Core +  effects?
[08:39:19] <xec_> granden: yes, effect i believe
[08:39:27] <xec_> http://jqueryui.com/effect/#easing
[08:40:46] <CathaliN> anyone can help me?
[08:40:48] <granden> Ok
[08:42:10] <granden> xec_: Hmm, did try it. Does not work now either.
[08:42:26] <Taar779_w> seutje: yeah I was looking at something like that but I'm ran into another problem. How does on know if it was given another selector? like there is .on('click', function () { //.. stuff .. }); and .on('click', 'a', function () { //.. stuff .. }). How does it know if the 'a' sector is there? Does it check to see if the second argument is a string or not?
[08:42:26] <xec_> same error?
[08:42:51] <granden> xec_: Yes
[08:44:07] <seutje> Taar779_w: arguments is a magic variable in javascript, it contains all arguments originally passed to the function -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[08:44:26] <seutje> (but it's only populated if you use it)
[08:45:57] <granden> xec_: The scrollTo works if i remove the easing effect from it.
[08:46:02] <granden> But it still gives me the same error.
[08:47:29] <Taar779_w> seutje: correct but unlike other languages there aren't keywords arguments so how does it know if an optional argument in the middle of the array is there or not? If it is the only optional argument than I guess it can check it's length and assume it's not there but I'll need a few optional arguments for my plugin. I believe it would be best to just use options and defaults for this case. Probably be way eaiser to determine what augment
[08:48:25] <seutje> Taar779_w: on checks if the second argument is a string, if it isn't, it assumes it's the callback, if it is, it assumes the 3rd argument is the callback
[08:48:28] <seutje> or something like that
[08:48:36] <xec_> granden: just did a very basic test here, no errors. can you reproduce the error? http://jsfiddle.net/rEZwD/
[08:49:19] <granden> ah old error log, ok it does not show if I remove the easing effect. so it is only if I want an easing effect from the ui.
[08:49:31] <seutje> Taar779_w: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L843
[08:49:42] <granden> xec_: I could check. Could I use jquery ui easings on the fiddle?
[08:50:05] <xec_> ?tias
[08:50:05] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:50:11] <Taar779_w> seutje: yeah probably, I was just trying to figure out how it managed it's arguments so I can pass in the arguments is needs when I call it. but my plugin would also need to reflect those arguments as well.
[08:51:02] <Taar779_w> seutje: ahh so it does check to see if it's an object or a string.
[08:51:28] <Bheam> yo
[08:51:29] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/rEZwD/1/
[08:51:35] <granden> xec_: See that one
[08:51:39] <granden> I get the same error there.
[08:51:43] <Bheam> anyone know if there's any way to activate image selection / resizing in wysiwyg editors in chrome?
[08:52:46] <Taar779_w> seutje: I just found this http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1771-Enable-And-Disable-jQuery-Event-Handlers-Rather-Than-Bind-And-Unbind-.htm it's basically what I'm trying to do. Google can be useful when you use the right keywords :P
[08:53:56] <xec_> granden: did jsfiddle just go down or is it just me
[08:54:10] <granden> I did put it down. It did not work for me ;)
[08:54:19] <granden> No it works for me.
[08:54:26] <Taar779_w> works for me as well
[08:54:58] <granden> ok now it does not work for me.
[08:55:31] <xec_> i get 502 bad gateway
[08:55:43] <xec_> and 504 gateway time-out
[08:55:50] <xec_> we need a good gateway
[08:57:34] <granden> xec_: Haha yeah. Hmm does not really mind now. The clock is alot. Time to go home ;)
[08:57:50] <granden> Thanks for your help though. I will take a new look at this tomorrow. :)
[08:59:02] <xec_> allright :) gl and good night
[09:06:49] <seutje> ?xy @ taar
[09:06:49] <bot-t> taar, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[09:06:50] <seutje> ?xy @ Taar779_w

[09:09:31] <Taar779_w> seutje: Sorry about that, I didn't explain my main goal at all ... I guess that would have been useful to know. :/
[09:09:46] <seutje> Taar779_w: don't feel too bad, happens all the time in here
[09:11:16] <Taar779_w> seutje: I'll try not to repeat that mistake and thanks for the help by the way. I think I have a good solution to my problem.
[09:11:30] <seutje> awesome
[09:13:10] <xiam> is there any alternative to the official jquery plugins site?
[09:14:31] <grom> xiam: http://jqapi.com/
[09:14:43] <xec_> xiam: check out "in the interim" at http://blog.jquery.com/2011/12/08/what-is-happening-to-the-jquery-plugins-site/
[09:15:12] <grom> xiam: ah plugins.. sorry
[09:23:57] <webdev> hello all.
[09:24:02] <chrisluther> good day allâ€¦ I have a question regarding configuration settings for the jQuery Loupe plugin.  Stumped so hoping for a suggestion or idea.  I have it working except that the "magnified" image is smaller not larger than the initial image.  The docs don't specifically mention how to modify the magnification.  Any ideas?
[09:37:18] <goddard> is there a way to get the max height of the current browser window?
[09:38:02] <goddard> i can't use percentages
[09:38:12] <goddard> i would do max height: 100%
[09:41:02] <mesuutt> hi, how ca I reach requested data in success? this is possible?
[09:42:07] <goddard> catch the response
[09:42:24] <goddard> success: function(response, textStatus, jqXHR){
[09:42:32] <keirlav87> try-> success: function(data) { console.log(data) }
[09:43:19] <mesuutt> I want to request query
[09:46:21] <mesuutt> I am giving a json object to data paramater of ajax function and I want to catch the json object in success. I know littile english.I hope you understand me :)
[09:48:42] <xec_> mesuutt: i'm confused. you're sending the same object as you want back?
[09:49:01] <mesuutt> xec_: yes
[09:49:06] <xec_> why?
[09:50:05] <xec_> i mean - apparently you already have what you want
[09:52:57] <xec_> mesuutt: maybe this helps: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[09:53:51] <mesuutt> xec_: I am requesting same data in 2 or more function in sequence and I make a subscribtion method for that, when response came, I am calling subscribers and give response to the subscribers
[09:53:51] <xec_> mesuutt: to read data you get from the server you basically do .done(function(myData){ /* my data is in myData*/ })
[09:53:54] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/v2Zrm/16/ - how do I find out if body > article.topic > article is located below #box img?
[09:55:49] <xec_> mesuutt: can you show me the relevant parts of your code?
[09:56:12] <xec_> abletony84: "below" in what sense?
[09:56:42] <mesuutt> xec: please wait.I am preparing :)
[09:59:08] <mesuutt> xec_: http://pastebin.com/3XTzPJD4
[09:59:21] <xec_> abletony84: hold on, placehold.it isn't working here for some reason. switched to lorempixel and i think i know what you mean
[09:59:47] <abletony84> xec_: i.e. article.topic > article's top starts after the end of #box img
[09:59:51] <abletony84> visually i mean
[09:59:57] <mesuutt> xec_: This is my class.I make this for manage ajax request in one pleace
[10:00:00] <abletony84> ah great
[10:00:51] <mesuutt> xec_: find this line :   return _get(params.data,function(cevap){
[10:01:11] <miguelLN> I am trying to get a json object from a web service call that requires {'county': {'year': '2002','stat': 'Crime'}}  where can I add this in an ajax call?
[10:01:29] <miguelLN> in jquery
[10:01:51] <xec_> abletony84: maybe you can check the article's offset from the top vs the image's offset + height, see ?offset
[10:01:52] <bot-t> abletony84, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[10:02:03] <miguelLN> data: just appends it to the url
[10:03:39] <xec_> mesuutt: sorry, this is a bit much code to just read and understand on the spot like this. especially when the comments and variable names are in... turkish?
[10:03:59] <abletony84> xec_: cool sounds like a plan hold on please
[10:04:16] <goddard> my ajax call is so slow
[10:04:22] <goddard> how can i speed it up
[10:04:32] <goddard> i have cut as much of the extra code i can
[10:04:37] <abletony84> xec_: i might have forgotten to show u this http://home.no/dwaynie/fiddle.png
[10:04:44] <xec_> goddard: have you tried setting the "quick" option to "true"?
[10:05:18] <xec_> goddard: (just kidding)
[10:05:27] <mib_mib> hi guys, if i am allowing Access-Control-Allow-Origin *; header on my server, will jquery ajax method work from Internet Explorer 8?
[10:05:37] <Firemonk> Whats wrong with this syntax? I cant see it -- cap.css("margin-top", cap.height() * -1);
[10:05:46] <xec_> goddard: try using a profiler to see if it's actually the javascript or the http request which is taking time
[10:06:53] <mesuutt> xec_: comments are in turkish, but only "cevap" variable in turkish and cevap translated to in english as response :)
[10:07:38] <miguelLN> Hello all, I am trying to get a json object from a web service call that requires {'county': {'year': '2002','stat': 'Crime'}}  where can I add this in an ajax call in jquery?
[10:08:06] <mesuutt> xec_: please find this line  :     return _get(params.data,function(cevap)
[10:08:20] <xec_> mesuutt: line 196?
[10:08:31] <bubu> miguelLN: in the data field of the ajax call
[10:08:33] <mesuutt> xec_: yes
[10:08:39] <xec_> ok
[10:08:52] <xec_> looking for it now. okay found it :P
[10:09:47] <mesuutt> I am using subscribe method for request response for when sent multiple request to the same url I am publishing subscribers
[10:10:18] <mesuutt> SR.publish(_data_hash,cevap);
[10:10:54] <miguelLN> thank bubu, but doesn't that just append to the url?
[10:12:09] <goddard> xec_: i thought that was set to default
[10:12:10] <mesuutt> xec_: But one below line _data_hash is parant's variable and when SR.ajax.get run more than one time, the  _data_hash is changing
[10:12:42] <mesuutt> And publisher running wrong
[10:12:49] <xec_> goddard: if you're referring to the "quick" option, it was a joke. there is no "quick" option
[10:12:58] <mesuutt> xec_: are you understand?
[10:13:46] <nanovirus> hey folks
[10:14:07] <abletony84> xec_: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/v2Zrm/18/
[10:14:25] <xec_> mesuutt: ooh, i think i do understand, lets see: you have a helper method running ajax calls for you. as long as you only have 1 at a time it works fine?
[10:15:22] <mesuutt> xec_:yes, it works fine when I call only one time
[10:15:29] <nanovirus> I'm using the msg plugin, and when I close the msg window I have an afterblock function that fires off a callback... sometimes this would then fire another msg event, but when this happens the second msg window appears below the bottom of the screen (you have to scroll down to see it)
[10:15:32] <abletony84> http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/v2Zrm/19/ rather
[10:15:40] <abletony84> (replaced placehold.it)
[10:15:48] <nanovirus> anyone know wtf is going down, and what I need to do to beat this issue with a big stick?
[10:15:57] <xec_> mesuutt: okay. then i think it's a scope issue (i'm guessing because i'm unable to see the big picture here)
[10:16:08] <xec_> mesuutt: do you know how to create a closure?
[10:17:39] <mesuutt> xec_: I think I know
[10:18:08] <sw22> I use jQuery at the end of my website's code to replace the innerHTML of some element on the site. This is how I do it: http://pastie.org/private/bcz1x5sdeqnmfn1haougw
[10:18:09] <sw22> The problem is that this causes a blinking problem. The old (default) content "blinks" into the new one, at times. Not always, but it happens. How can I avoid this "blinking problem"?
[10:20:06] <mesuutt> xec_: Is there a problem in the code?
[10:20:51] <xec_> mesuutt: i think what you want is to cache the state of the _data_hash
[10:21:23] <xec_> mesuutt: if that's what your issue is, that it has the wrong value?
[10:23:03] <xec_> mesuutt: *if* i'm right, then *maybe* something like this *could* work http://pastebin.com/wy1NpB7J
[10:23:59] <xec_> actually, the syntax is off there. don't copypaste
[10:24:05] <xec_> but maybe you get the idea?
[10:24:37] <sw22> noone?
[10:25:46] <Saaether> sw22: what would you like it to do?
[10:25:56] <sw22> Saaether: just appear without blinking
[10:26:11] <xec_> sw22: you don't need to wrap in docready if it's at the end of the document
[10:26:37] <xec_> sw22: you also don't need to load jQuery to do document.getElementById('someid').innerHTML = "something else";
[10:26:56] <sw22> oh
[10:27:14] <sw22> xec_: but will putting this same code to the top, or removing document.ready (and removing jQuery), fix this?
[10:27:51] <Saaether> it may speed it up alittle, it all depends how fast the browser parses the javascript
[10:27:59] <sw22> hmm ok
[10:28:08] <xec_> sw22: i wouldn't move it to the top, but otherwise yes
[10:28:38] <xec_> sw22: it might not fix it entirely, depending on the rest of the page, but it sure doesn't hurt
[10:28:46] <sw22> ok
[10:28:57] <sw22> thanks
[10:29:21] <sw22> i use this, by the way, to replace a "foo (at) bar.com" string with a genuine email address (printed using some js functions)
[10:29:36] <sw22> kind of annoying to see that placeholder email blink into the real one
[10:29:45] <mesuutt> xec_: I cant test it I am exiting now, but I think this will be work.I will try this.Thanks
[10:30:22] <xec_> mesuutt: the typo was that the ")(_data_hash_)" was supposed to be one line further down, if you didn't catch it
[10:30:46] <xec_> s/hash_/hash
[10:31:09] <Saaether> sw22: you could hide all the content until you do the replace and then show it all
[10:31:17] <Saaether> then their is no blinking
[10:31:25] <Saaether> there*
[10:31:36] <mesuutt> I saw that, but I understand What will I do , I will try :)
[10:31:57] <sw22> Saaether: how can I do that? can I somehow hide only that element?
[10:32:33] <Saaether> you have your code hosted some where i can take a look at it?
[10:33:10] <sw22> Saaether: nope, unfortunately it's just local atm
[10:33:19] <sw22> so i assume it will be even worse online
[10:33:22] <sw22> local = fast
[10:34:13] <sw22> Saaether: but it's very simple. just a <span id="someid">something</span> in the document
[10:35:08] <sw22> I have simplified it like this: http://pastie.org/private/rtj0bopvepgtlhqmf2t35g
[10:35:14] <sw22> unfortunately, it still blinks
[10:36:23] <Saaether> sw22 http://jsfiddle.net/NY5TK/
[10:38:38] <sw22> Saaether: well, the problem with this is that it requires js :)
[10:38:46] <sw22> non-js should see that placeholder
[10:38:52] <sw22> oh
[10:38:56] <sw22> i guess I can have two elements
[10:39:14] <sw22> one shown (placeholder) and one hidden (real email)
[10:39:16] <sw22> hmm
[10:39:47] <sw22> nah, that would probably still blink
[10:41:32] <minijupe> I'm using jQuery with noConflict because the app also uses prototype (old app). Is there a way to assign jQuery to something else shorter? Like perhaps just 'Q' ?
[10:42:41] <shoky> window.Q = jQuery.noConflict();  ?
[10:43:18] <minijupe> I was just doing Q = jQuery, which seems to work, but I'm not a JS expert
[10:43:48] <Famic> is there a simple way to get an element's css transition duration ?
[10:44:44] <shoky> minijupe: ya, same effect pretty much
[10:45:04] <jim_m> hi guys, I'm not sure if this is a JQuery or YUI question, but I have this code that I need to change to JQuery, can anyone help?
[10:45:33] <tomasm-> hey is there a way to use jquery to submit a form with modified data? I was thinking of using ajaxSubmit() but it's not ajax.... I want a genuine custom form submission that redirects the whole page
[10:45:44] <jacobroufa_> minijupe: http://jsfiddle.net/kveXg/
[10:45:59] <jim_m> this is the code, it's for json:
[10:46:10] <jacobroufa_> minijupe: then you can just put all your code inside of that initial function or the doc ready inside of it and use $ like you normally would :)
[10:46:29] <jim_m> function func_init(b){YUI().use("io","json-parse",function(o){var e="/publish/_json/quotes.js";var i=function(h,c){};var d=function(n,c){try{var m=o.JSON.parse(c.responseText);var j=m.success;if(m.success==true){var h=m.posts}l(h)}catch(k){return}};var l=function(k){if(!(k.length>0)){return false}var j=Math.floor(Math.random()*k.length);var n=k[j];var
[10:46:30] <jim_m> h=o.Node.create("<blockquote></blockquote>");h.set("innerHTML",n.excerpt?n.excerpt:n.title);h.set("title",n.title);a.appendChild(h);if(n.url){var m=o.Node.create('<div class="quote-src clearfix"></div>');var c=o.Node.create("<a></a>");c.set("innerHTML","who said it?");c.set("href",n.url);if(n.target){c.set("target",n.target)}m.appendChild(c);a.appendChild(m)}};o.on("io:success",d);o.on("io:failure",i);var f={method:"GET"};function g(){a=o.one(this);var
[10:46:30] <jim_m> c=o.io(e,f)}o.on("contentready",g,b)})};
[10:46:46] <dblosevn> tomasm-: attach a submit listener to the form and modify your data then return true and the submit will go through as a normal submittion
[10:47:05] <shoky> jim_m: nobody wants to see that. especially not in an IRC channel
[10:47:12] <dblosevn> ya i got blonded
[10:47:13] <jacobroufa_> jim_m: use a fiddle or pastebin or something please...
[10:47:14] <jim_m> ok
[10:47:17] <dblosevn> *blinded even
[10:47:20] <jim_m> sorry
[10:47:23] <minijupe> dblosevn: tnx
[10:47:40] <dblosevn> minijupe: np
[10:47:49] <minijupe> jim_m: use pastie.org or gist.github.com/
[10:47:49] <jacobroufa_> minijupe: understand the fiddle i posted? :)
[10:47:58] <tomasm-> dblosevn, how do I modify the data? some of them are arbitrary, not in the page
[10:48:02] <shoky> jim_m: and dont give us minified code
[10:48:28] <jim_m> how do I unminify it?
[10:48:37] <dblosevn> tomasm-: give me a sec
[10:48:53] <shoky> you don't. you acquire a non-minified debug version
[10:48:54] <minijupe> jacobroufa_: Mostly, but it's a bit cryptic for me, as I don't spend most of my time in JS world (RoR dev).
[10:49:11] <shoky> if you want someone to understand it, at least
[10:49:24] <minijupe> jim_m: run it through a js formatter: http://jsbeautifier.org/
[10:49:31] <shoky> but pasting some minified code and going "i need this in jquery"  won't get you far at all
[10:49:31] <jim_m> minijupe, cool!
[10:50:24] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/v2Zrm/20/ - all 2nd level articles located below the big yellow image should break off and move all the way to the left. How to continue with what I got?
[10:50:47] <jacobroufa_> minijupe: copy that. basically, youre assigning the latest version (included right before your script) of jquery to a var (Q, in this case). then running an immediately invoked function that takes the Q var at the end and passes it to the newly created $ namespace that is specific to the function. then you can use $ for everything inside of that function.
[10:51:20] <tomasm-> im thinking im just gonna stick with ajaxSubmit and then set the window.location.href  on success
[10:51:41] <jacobroufa_> minijupe: and just put all your code inside of that and it should work with a $ like all jquery code you see around the nets :)
[10:51:55] <minijupe> jacobroufa_:  I think with extended scripts, the use of $ sometimes for jQuery and sometimes for prototype might confuse me and other devs though
[10:52:01] <jim_m> minijupe, here it is:  http://pastebin.com/y9E61WpD
[10:52:39] <dblosevn> tomasm-: http://jsfiddle.net/2Qmrm/
[10:53:05] <tomasm-> dblosevn, yeah im talking about adding NEW fields, that dont already exist
[10:53:19] <tomasm-> dblosevn, but I'm going with ajaxSubmit instead
[10:53:20] <jacobroufa_> minijupe: comments, my friend. let them know that inside that function the $ is namespaced for jquery :)
[10:54:37] <dblosevn> you can add new fields as well,
[10:55:48] <dblosevn> tomasm-: you can do what ever you want to the dom before submit return true and it will finish the submit as normal
[10:59:08] <jim_m> anyone know how to make the switch to jquery on this http://pastebin.com/y9E61WpD ?
[11:04:16] <johnkpaul> jim_m: is that minified?
[11:04:51] <jim_m> it was before
[11:05:16] <jim_m> I used jsbeautifier.org to make it more readable
[11:06:04] <johnkpaul> jim_m: you don't have the unminified code?
[11:06:31] <mib_mib> hi guys, how do i make my javascript function run AFTER i have loaded an external stylesheet with jquery? see this code: https://gist.github.com/c11b74b66c848e504aeb
[11:06:39] <johnkpaul> from what I can see, it's not using _that_ much YUI, but it's very hard to make the changes with one letter variable names
[11:07:42] <jim_m> johnkpaul, I don't think I have the unminified code
[11:08:09] <johnkpaul> jim_m: hm, then you have a pretty hard job ahead of you, minified code isn't intended to be modified by hand
[11:19:23] <NoiseEee> jim_m: why switch to jquery?
[11:19:51] <jim_m> NoiseEee, I'm transferring to a site that only has jquery library
[11:19:57] <Auger> anyone here familiar with blockui
[11:22:12] <solepixel_> i'm having trouble wrapping my brain about how to use the filter method to filter a selection based on child elements of each. so, $a = $('.people'); $found = $a.filter(function(){ return $(this).find('.name').text() == 'John'; });
[11:22:23] <solepixel_> this doesn't seem to filter the "list of people"
[11:23:35] <solepixel_> i'm trying to filter a selection of elements by a child element of each item in the selection
[11:29:05] <solepixel_> when I console.log($(this));, i get the entire element, when I want to filter each of the child elements
[11:30:26] <Cork> solepixel_: yes, $(this) will be the element from the $a list
[11:30:47] <Cork> what is it you have problem with grasping?
[11:31:04] <fission6> solepixel_: do do that
[11:31:08] <fission6> so
[11:31:59] <solepixel_> i guess i was expecting to filter to work like $.each()
[11:32:17] <solepixel_> i think what i'm going to do is use $.each() and then do what I need to do within the loop
[11:32:45] <Cork> solepixel_: filter works like each
[11:33:49] <Cork> solepixel_: so i'm having problem finding what you have problem with
[11:34:55] <solepixel_> ok, so if i use $(this).find('.name').text() I get JohnJimJamesBillSteve
[11:35:35] <solepixel_> so running a test against that value doesn't check each element individually, but rather the element as a whole
[11:35:40] <Cork> solepixel_: if you have multiple .name elements in one of the .people elements yes
[11:36:24] <solepixel_> my html is <div class="people"><div class="person"><span class="name">John</span></div> ... more .person elements ... </div>
[11:36:41] <Cork> hmm that shouldn't give that effect
[11:36:42] <solepixel_> so people itself contains multiple name elements
[11:36:45] <Cork> could you generate a fiddle?
[11:36:51] <Cork> ?p
[11:36:51] <solepixel_> yeah let me see if i can
[11:36:52] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:38:45] <swe_ET> solepixel_: $('.name').each(funktion () {  // do whatever });
[11:39:07] <Cork> swe_ET: he wants to do it per .person, not per .name
[11:39:13] <jrajav> Question: What can fiddle do that jsbin can't?
[11:39:17] <jrajav> I find jsbin a lot prettier :P
[11:39:42] <Cork> jrajav: it can work without localStorage :P
[11:40:13] <jrajav> Fair enough, but assume I have localStorage :P
[11:40:15] <Cork> joke aside, jsfiddle helps you a bit more then jsbin, and jsbin used to be the recomended site
[11:40:31] <jrajav> Can you elaborate?
[11:40:59] <Cork> you can do ajax tests, it helps you to add librarys and so on
[11:41:22] <jrajav> jsbin has an "Add library" button too though
[11:41:41] <Cork> ya, but its much more limited
[11:41:43] <jrajav> I haven't run into AJAX requests yet
[11:41:59] <Cork> jrajav: that said, don't miss understand me, i like jsbin too
[11:42:10] <Cork> and i actually liked it even more before the redesign
[11:42:37] <Qbix1> hey everyone
[11:42:39] <Qbix1> who here is in nyc?
[11:42:43] <Cork> (used to use jsbin before jsfiddle cause you could do much more with it)
[11:43:34] <dblosevn> now were a dating channel lmao :-D
[11:43:45] <Cork> apparently...
[11:44:12] <dblosevn> ya i used to have jsbin installed on one of my servers
[11:44:33] <Cork> wow that's even more hardcore the me :)
[11:44:44] <dblosevn> used be js.chosd.com
[11:44:48] <Cork> i have a paste, but not jsbin
[11:44:50] <dblosevn> gotta get that back up
[11:45:06] <dblosevn> chosd.com was pastebin with wildcard and js was jsbin
[11:45:31] <dblosevn> disabled pasting to www to keep the bots out
[11:46:05] <tkeith> I'm developing a web-store type application. My plan is to create a REST API using Flask (a simple Python web framework) and design an essentially static (in terms of content served) client web site that uses jQuery to access the REST api and perform actions, get data, etc. Does this seem like a reasonable design? Any drawbacks or other suggestions?
[11:46:40] <Cork> tkeith: nope, that should work fine
[11:47:14] <Cork> tkeith: as long as you don't need to server many different actions from the front interface
[11:47:30] <dblosevn> serve even lol
[11:47:31] <Cork> then it might be a hindrance
[11:47:37] <tkeith> Cork: Ok, awesome. I'm surprised I haven't seen many (or possibly any) websites designed like this. It seems like a logical way to do things to me?
[11:47:51] <Cork> tkeith: there are
[11:47:54] <tkeith> Cork: You mean many actions from the same interface, because it would require loading a lot of javascript?
[11:47:58] <Cork> extensions.gnome.org for example :)
[11:48:25] <dblosevn> most of my apps are based on a ssas model, can throw any frontend on them you want
[11:48:36] <tkeith> Cork: I still plan to have a few different static pages for different parts of the app, so I shouldn't have *too* many actions per page
[11:48:52] <tkeith> I guess I just haven't seen the sites that do, I'll take a look at Gnome Extensions!
[11:49:05] <Qbix1> who here is in nyc?
[11:49:12] <tkeith> dblosevn: Yeah, it saves from having to develop a separate API for those who might want one!
[11:49:17] <Cork> Qbix1: why do you ask?
[11:49:32] <tkeith> Qbix1: I wish I was, does that count?
[11:49:39] <Cork> tkeith: one warning though
[11:49:46] <Qbix1> Well, the hurricane just happened
[11:49:48] <kouellette> yea, nothing like a good swim in the subway
[11:49:52] <Qbix1> Just wondering where there is good internet in Brooklyn
[11:49:59] <Cork> you prob want cookie based login for the site, if you're planing to have logins
[11:50:16] <Cork> Qbix1: then ask that instead
[11:50:42] <Qbix1> Well, I'm allowed a follow up question right? :)
[11:51:07] <Cork> tkeith: cause sadly basic auth works really bad in browsers
[11:51:13] <tkeith> Cork: Cookie based as opposed to what? My plan is to have an "auth" API function that takes a username and password, and if successful, returns an API key that will be stored in a cookie and used for future requests. I won't be reading any cookies from the API requests themselves. Is that reasonable?
[11:51:33] <Cork> tkeith: http auth
[11:51:46] <tkeith> Oh, and a "delete_api_key" function to essentially logout
[11:51:56] <tkeith> Cork: Oh yeah, no, cookie login definitely (as I described)
[11:52:18] <Cork> tkeith: i fiddled with a pure http basic auth login system for my backend about two years ago
[11:52:33] <Cork> everything worked really well, until i tried to make the user logout...
[11:52:41] <Cork> and... found it i CAN'T T_T
[11:52:59] <tkeith> Cork: I don't even know much about HTTP auth. Only times I've used it are for a super quick auth to a completely private app, implimented in Apache config
[11:53:54] <Cork> tkeith: it's quite common for rest api's to use http auth
[11:54:04] <Cork> that's why i warned about it
[11:54:45] <tkeith> Cork: Oh, I didn't even realize that. I suppose it could work if it accepted a temporary API key as the HTTP password, rather than a permanent key/password? But anyway, I don't plan on doing that... I'll just pass it as a parameter
[11:55:02] <tkeith> Cork: Especially since I have some functions (like login) that won't require authentication
[11:55:21] <jhaldson> on one app, our API checked the session to make sure the user was logged in before the API would return the call
[11:55:27] <minijupe> should I be able to use the *= partial match selector? If so what is wrong with this: $("#my_div[id*='substring']")
[11:55:34] <jhaldson> or had proper permission, etc
[11:55:40] <Cork> tkeith: no, the browser will store the http credentials, and only way for the user to logout is to end the session (most of the time close the browser)
[11:55:59] <Cork> (not tab, but the complete browser)
[11:56:14] <tkeith> Cork: But if the API key was temporary, once they logged out they would tell the server to delete the API key, so the stored key would be useless (and they would essentially be logged out), right?
[11:56:15] <Cork> except for in firefox, where that won't end the session -_-'
[11:56:35] <tkeith> jhaldson: Would you suggest that over passing the key as a parameter?
[11:57:02] <Cork> tkeith: they would be asked for a new username and password is the server responded with unauthorized
[11:57:39] <jhaldson> well it's not really that much different
[11:57:50] <Auger> i am the jquery master!
[11:57:50] <jhaldson> it still means your API calls to check if the call is authorized or not
[11:57:55] <Cork> tkeith: but, not even that is garanteed to log them out (if the user click cancel, the browser will keep sending the credentials to the server)
[11:58:13] <Cork> tkeith: anyway basically its a real mess, and should be avoided
[11:58:36] <tkeith> Cork: Yeah, but if they were logged out then there would be no reason for them to be trying to make API calls. I still wouldn't use HTTP auth, but I think it could be possible to make it work.
[11:58:54] <tkeith> Cork: Yeah, it's probably just people taking the HTTP-ness of REST too far
[11:59:14] <Cork> tkeith: only way to make it work is by killing the session server side
[11:59:29] <tkeith> Cork: Yeah that's what I meant, and yeah it's messy
[11:59:35] <Cork> tkeith: but if you store the session in the users cookie (like rails dose by default), you're smocked...
[12:00:00] <abletony84> hey fellas....at this forum thread layout at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/FH5vc/ - how to make all 1st level replies break off like this: http://i.imgur.com/g7KZQ.png ?
[12:00:01] <Cork> *smoked
[12:00:24] <tkeith> Cork: I've decided I'm not a big fan of the "bigger" MVC frameworks that do things like sessions for me. (Maybe I'll change my mind some day)
[12:00:58] <Cork> tkeith: i used to like rails quite a bit, but rails 3.x keeps breaking things right and left
[12:00:58] <Saaether> abletony84 so you want to rip off 4chan?
[12:01:13] <Cork> and ... na, i start to look more and more at go
[12:01:26] <abletony84> Cork: go is sweet
[12:01:27] <Cork> that starts to be a really interesting alternative
[12:01:38] <tkeith> Cork: Is Go another Ruby framework?
[12:01:39] <abletony84> tkeith: many "bigger" MVC frameworks outsource sessions
[12:02:03] <abletony84> tkeith: go is google
[12:02:08] <Cork> it is, but until repentantly, it wasn't a feasible replacement for something like rails
[12:02:09] <Cork> abletony84: ^
[12:02:23] <Cork> abletony84: well not really
[12:02:39] <abletony84> hmmm i see
[12:02:46] <Cork> it's intentionally broken free from google, but its biggest user and the one starting it was google
[12:03:24] <tkeith> abletony84: Are you telling me to Google? Cause I'm having trouble finding it... "go" is very generic
[12:03:28] <Cork> that was a necessity, for it to be interesting for other outside google to use it
[12:03:38] <abletony84> tkeith: ha ha funny
[12:03:56] <tkeith> abletony84: Not trying to be, I'm honestly actually confused...
[12:03:57] <Cork> ?g golang @ tkeith
[12:03:59] <bot-t> tkeith, The Go Programming Language - http://golang.org/
[12:04:00] <abletony84> Cork: thanks i didnt know
[12:04:26] <Cork> tkeith: to deskribe it really shortly go is like compiled js
[12:04:29] <abletony84> Cork: i wish go would work on openbsd for instance
[12:04:30] <Cork> seen from its syntax
[12:04:41] <Cork> mixed with a few goodies from other languages
[12:04:42] <tkeith> Oh hey, a language. I hadn't heard of it, that could be interesting...
[12:04:53] <strict9> Running into a really annoying issue. None of my functions in my .js files are being recognized. The file is included via the <script> tag, but when I call the function I get a Object [object Object] has no method 'jscroll' error. Any ideas of where to look?
[12:04:57] <abletony84> i mean
[12:05:01] <abletony84> porting openbsd over to go
[12:05:09] <Cork> its biggest shortcoming is that it doens't run on windows
[12:05:23] <abletony84> i see i see
[12:05:34] <tkeith> Cork: I've given up trying to run things on windows, I just use it to work remotely on Linux... lol
[12:05:48] <Cork> abletony84: but i think you can get it working on bsd
[12:06:20] <tkeith> Cork: Although the site does have a Windows binary download (or so it says)
[12:06:56] <Cork> tkeith: no, it can't be run on windows, i think ppl have been able to get it working somewhat in cygwin
[12:07:18] <Cork> but on the other hand, its mainly for developing servers, so... :)
[12:07:50] <Cork> tkeith: it's most interesting feature is that it has a built in webserver in the language
[12:08:04] <Cork> tkeith: and built in support for json and websockets and so on
[12:08:07] <Cork> quite nice
[12:08:15] <abletony84> <3
[12:08:22] <abletony84> its what the public wants
[12:08:26] <tkeith> Sounds interesting, I"ll have to look more into it!
[12:08:51] <tkeith> But right now I just realized I have class, so I gotta go! Thanks for all the help and advice!
[12:08:59] <TelFiRE> Anyone see any problems with this?  var rxSideWidth = doc.width()-780;  sectionContent.css('width','rxSideWidth');  (doc is jQuery(document); and sectionContent is jQuery('#section-content');
[12:09:01] <Cork> and, what you need to remind you from time to time when you write it, is that its a compiled language
[12:09:10] <Cork> and THAT'S impressing
[12:09:30] <seutje> TelFiRE: why quote rxSideWidth?
[12:09:38] <TelFiRE> ah is that what's wrong
[12:09:41] <abletony84> nice yeah
[12:09:44] <Cork> TelFiRE: sectionContent.css('width','rxSideWidth') ?? what?
[12:09:45] <therealklanni> Anyone having issues with the latest QUnit?
[12:10:00] <TelFiRE> what is confusing Cork
[12:10:25] <TelFiRE> I got rid of the quotes but it's still not doing anything :/ not throwing any errors, but not setting the width of #section-content to the value of rxSideWidth either
[12:10:28] <Cork> TelFiRE: there is no value in css for "rxSideWidth"
[12:10:31] <therealklanni> I just created a QUnit test page and I'm using the jQuery CDN to load QUnit... if I try to put more than one test() in it only ever runs the first test
[12:10:48] <TelFiRE> Cork: did you not see my first line? var rxSideWidth = doc.width()-780;
[12:10:52] <therealklanni> If I put an asyncTest (following the example) it never completes
[12:10:55] <Krinkle> therealklanni: Can you replicate it on jsfiddle?
[12:10:59] <Cork> TelFiRE: you need to tell css what type it is
[12:11:08] <Cork> TelFiRE: ya, i see that now
[12:11:10] <therealklanni> Krinkle: I'll give it a shot
[12:11:25] <Cork> TelFiRE: sectionContent.css('width',rxSideWidth + ');
[12:11:32] <Cork> TelFiRE: * sectionContent.css('width',rxSideWidth + 'px');
[12:11:36] <TelFiRE> gotcha
[12:11:36] <TelFiRE> thx
[12:13:21] <Cork> solepixel_: did you solve your filter problem?
[12:14:12] <Cork> abletony84: https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=611
[12:15:25] <therealklanni> Krinkle: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/68NJs/
[12:15:40] <Krinkle> therealklanni: There is the problem
[12:15:47] <Krinkle> therealklanni: You're calling stop() and asyncTest()
[12:15:53] <Krinkle> that means there is 2 levels of async being expected
[12:15:57] <Krinkle> but you only ever call start() once
[12:16:06] <abletony84> Cork: out of curiosity do you use netbsd?
[12:16:07] <Krinkle> either use test() with stop() or just asyncTest()
[12:16:10] <Krinkle> asyncTest = test + stop
[12:16:30] <Cork> abletony84: no, i'm almost compleatly a linux guy
[12:16:43] <abletony84> ah ok
[12:17:01] <csdco> I am trying to listen for a custom event and preventDefault(), but the event that's being passed to me is an empty object.
[12:17:05] <Cork> have a few servers with solaris, but that's it
[12:17:10] <csdco> This is the event trigger: var event = $.Event('drupalOverlayBeforeClose'); $(document).trigger(event);
[12:17:30] <csdco> Don't I simply need to: $(document).bind('drupalOverlayBeforeClose', function(event) { return false });
[12:17:36] <therealklanni> Krinkle: even without it it was doing it.
[12:17:47] <Krinkle> therealklanni: Also, you're calling $.ajax incorrectly
[12:18:03] <Krinkle> $.ajax, not ajax(). and $.ajax( ... ).done( function ). not $.ajax( ..., function );
[12:18:05] <therealklanni> Krinkle: that was an internal function I forgot to add that
[12:18:19] <Krinkle> therealklanni: http://jsfiddle.net/68NJs/1/
[12:18:26] <Krinkle> ok
[12:18:52] <Cork> csdco: jquery wrapps the element if i remember correctly
[12:18:53] <therealklanni> Anyway, it seems to run both tests without stop() but on my local machine it doesn't even without it
[12:19:06] <Cork> csdco: sorry the event object
[12:19:27] <Krinkle> therealklanni: I'd say take a good look at your local container, this http://jsfiddle.net/68NJs/1/ shows it works fine.
[12:19:33] <therealklanni> Krinkle: after 2 seconds the timeout calls start() and "completes" the test, but it never runs the second one
[12:19:41] <csdco> Hmm.. so when I do â€¦function(event) { do I need to do something else to get ahold of it? Because in this context if I console.log(event) I have a completely empty object.
[12:19:55] <csdco> But if I console.log(event) in the trigger code, I get the whole object as expected.
[12:19:58] <Krinkle> therealklanni: that's because you called stop twice (once in asyncTest and once manually)
[12:20:11] <Krinkle> So it won't start the second test until start() is called again
[12:20:16] <therealklanni> Right but I took out stop()
[12:20:19] <Krinkle> the fix is to remove the extra stop()
[12:20:23] <Krinkle> then it should work
[12:20:26] <Krinkle> maybe cached?
[12:20:28] <therealklanni> In fact it was never there in the first place, I added it when I started having problems
[12:20:47] <therealklanni> So even before I ever added stop() it never completed the second test()
[12:20:49] <Krinkle> therealklanni: either way, I can't help you if it works on jsfiddle..
[12:20:54] <Cork> csdco: btw preventDefault make little sense on custom events
[12:20:59] <Krinkle> try to replicate the problem on jsfiddle.
[12:21:21] <csdco> Maybe true, but the custom event then runs isDefaultPrevented() and if so, stops execution.
[12:21:24] <Cork> csdco: that will only have an effect if the other listeners for the event listens for it
[12:21:39] <Cork> csdco: yes, that will work
[12:21:41] <Manxa> anyone have a good work around for the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' issue?
[12:21:53] <Cork> Manxa: "issue"?
[12:21:56] <csdco> So why does console.log(event) show an empty object in my bound listener?
[12:22:15] <Manxa> Cork: i'm trying to call a different url from another domain from my vm
[12:22:24] <grafi> is there any way the ajax error callback can "know" what the request was that failed?
[12:22:33] <Cork> Manxa: and the other domain sets that header?
[12:22:46] <Manxa> Cork: sure?
[12:22:47] <Krinkle> therealklanni: also, beware of trailing commas in object literals. They are invalid syntax tolerated in Chrome/Firefox, but its still invalid and IE crashes on it.
[12:23:06] <Cork> Manxa: it should work find in all browsers except ie
[12:23:07] <Krinkle> "dataType: 'json'," <!
[12:23:21] <Manxa> Cork: 1s.  lemme get code for u
[12:23:40] <Krinkle> therealklanni: Hm.. why do you call start from setTimeout instead of from ajax?
[12:23:45] <therealklanni> Krinkle: I know, thanks :)
[12:23:54] <Cork> csdco: ah, i see whats prob your problem
[12:24:00] <therealklanni> Krinkle: because that's how the example shows it done
[12:24:04] <Cork> csdco: you need new in your statement
[12:24:17] <Cork> csdco: new $.Event()
[12:24:22] <Manxa> Cork: http://dpaste.org/UeazH/
[12:24:24] <Krinkle> therealklanni: if you want to continue if the async takes to long, qunit has a buit thing for that. if start() isn't called within X after stop(), it aborts and does the next one.
[12:24:33] <Krinkle> therealklanni: but the example didn't contain the $.ajax call, right>
[12:24:34] <csdco> Oh no kidding â€“ in my listener?
[12:24:38] <csdco> cork:
[12:24:46] <Cork> csdco: no where you create it
[12:24:47] <Krinkle> anyhow, you know it already, so never mind :)
[12:24:52] <Motafoca> guys, im using jquery.tweet.js on my website, it came with a theme i bought, if i leave the username to the one that came with the theme, it works perfect, when i change it doesnt load anymore, anyone know whats wrong? i searched google, but couldnt find a valid fix, also checked my twitter account settings to see if i have to enable anything, didnt find either
[12:25:04] <Cork> csdco: var event = new $.Event('drupalOverlayBeforeClose')
[12:25:06] <csdco> This is not adequate: var event = $.Event('drupalOverlayBeforeClose');
[12:25:09] <csdco> Ahh interesting.
[12:25:14] <therealklanni> Krinkle: that was in reference to your comma remark
[12:25:17] <therealklanni> ;)
[12:26:13] <therealklanni> I'm going based off of this: http://api.qunitjs.com/asyncTest/
[12:26:15] <Cork> Manxa: what am i suppose to see from that pb?
[12:26:25] <minijupe> sometimes when my jQuery code has errors, Chrome console doesn't show the error to me. Any suggestions on how to get the error?
[12:26:59] <Manxa> Cork: that's the code i'm using to call make my call to the ups URL and where i get the Access-Control-Allow-Origin issue
[12:27:03] <csdco> Cork: adding 'new' doesn't appear to make this behave any different.
[12:28:14] <therealklanni> Krinkle: if I remove the timer and put start() in the "success" callback for the ajax, it still doesn't run the second test. It's like QUnit ignores it
[12:28:40] <Krinkle> therealklanni: does your ajax thing actually works?
[12:28:50] <Krinkle> try attaching an error callback and call console.log from there
[12:29:03] <therealklanni> Yeah the ajax part works
[12:29:35] <therealklanni> It's just not running the second test, and even the output shows "1 test" as if I only defined 2
[12:29:42] <therealklanni> defined 1*
[12:29:44] <Krinkle> therealklanni: reproduce on jsfiddle..
[12:30:12] <therealklanni> Apparently that's not possible, I copy/pasted what I had in there and it worked on jsfiddle
[12:30:40] <Krinkle> Different ajax target, different jquery/qunit version, different global variables..
[12:30:49] <Krinkle> maybe include the ajax function?
[12:31:21] <therealklanni> Well, if I move the test() above asyncTest() it does the same thing, the first test is run and the second test doesn't exist
[12:31:35] <therealklanni> As far as QUnit is concerned
[12:32:01] <therealklanni> Doesn't matter which is first, it only ever runs the first test
[12:32:13] <Krinkle> therealklanni: how are you running the tests?
[12:32:29] <Cork> csdco: http://jsfiddle.net/6LJUA/
[12:32:40] <therealklanni> I have them wrapped in a jQuery.ready if that matters, though I don't see why it would
[12:32:52] <therealklanni> I want to do tests that depend on jQuery
[12:33:15] <therealklanni> (function( $ ) { ... tests .. })( jQuery);
[12:33:40] <therealklanni> I don't see any reason that should interfere
[12:33:44] <therealklanni> But...
[12:33:46] <csdco> That works in the fiddle. Trying to see what the original plugins code is any different.
[12:33:55] <Cork> csdco: http://jsfiddle.net/6LJUA/1/ so it might be that your first event triggers before your doing your preventDefault
[12:33:58] <csdco> Cork: FWIW I don't see 'new' as having any effect, with or without.
[12:34:51] <therealklanni> Well, commenting out that wrapper doesn't change anything, so that can't be it
[12:34:55] <Cork> csdco: well, the code i've seen in implementation examples (and what exists in code all uses it
[12:35:10] <therealklanni> Krinkle: does that answer your question?
[12:35:18] <csdco> Cork: I don't  see new here: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[12:35:19] <Cork> csdco: but sure, i haven't checked if $.Event runs new internally if its missing
[12:35:26] <csdco> Cork: Right, good point!
[12:35:38] <Krinkle> therealklanni: I don't have any question.
[12:35:48] <csdco> Cork: The original code has it's functionality fun underneath the trigger() and the isDefaultPrevented()
[12:35:50] <therealklanni> You asked how am I running the tests
[12:35:51] <Krinkle> therealklanni: If you have a problem, I need to be able to see that problem. Right now I don't.
[12:35:56] <Krinkle> therealklanni: oh, right.
[12:36:02] <Krinkle> therealklanni: Yes, that answers that.
[12:36:12] <Cork> csdco: return new jQuery.Event( src, props );
[12:36:13] <therealklanni> ;)
[12:36:13] <Krinkle> therealklanni: So I assume you're running this on a plain index.html file in a browser?
[12:36:16] <Cork> so ya, it does it already
[12:36:18] <therealklanni> Yep
[12:36:20] <csdco> Right on
[12:36:41] <therealklanni> Just loading jQuery and QUnit from jQuery CDN
[12:37:00] <Cork> csdco: you found the problem?
[12:37:25] <csdco> Cork: No, my code is working in jsfiddle but not when it's in 2 js files on my dev server.
[12:37:29] <csdco> This is quite odd.
[12:37:44] <Cork> might be race
[12:38:51] <csdco> I have a console.log() in the original and in mine â€“ mine runs first. but the event object is just empty. Maybe it's a scope thing; my code is inside of an "attach" method
[12:38:57] <csdco> Trying to pull it outside and we'll see.
[12:41:27] <csdco> Cork: Thanks for your help man, I'm going to post in a Drupal issue queue and see if this is maybe a bug. Appreciate it :)
[12:47:38] <Cronoh> is something like this valid in javascript: var value = $(this).attr('id').split("_")[3];
[12:48:45] <ssapphiree> looks pretty valid
[12:49:38] <Cronoh> i can save the 3rd result of split without saving the array inbetween ?
[12:50:27] <Cork> yes
[12:50:45] <Cork> split will generate an array, and [] on that array is perfectly valid
[12:51:11] <Cork> Cronoh: it will crash id is an empty string though
[12:52:23] <TelFiRE> Guys something really weird is happening. When I initially load this page, I have this function running every time the browser is resized, and it works exactly as intended (see function here: http://pastebin.com/sQ4j9nmh). But once I resize a sidebar (separate function), now this function is broken. It still runs and it goes to the right branch, and I get the console.log from the end of it. But it will no longer run the .css command! :( Any clues? Live site
[12:52:23] <TelFiRE> http://urgent.cpstest1.info/ )
[12:52:38] <Cronoh> ok thanks for the info
[12:55:15] <x0rcist> anybody make a live activity stream before?
[12:55:40] <MistuhKurtz> YouTube can handle that x0rcist
[12:56:01] <x0rcist> Mistuh; I am trying to custom code something onto my site
[12:56:12] <x0rcist> I've seen some tutorials but I want a plain english explanation dev wise
[12:57:24] <kollapse> Hello. In ``$(this).css({left: box_width}, 300)``, what does 300 stand for ?
[12:58:30] <hlve> well, that's not even written correctly, kollapse lol
[12:58:32] <danheberden> kollapse: nothing, in that example
[12:58:47] <hlve> it's missing an 'animate' possible?
[12:58:51] <hlve> possibly*
[12:59:01] <danheberden> that's what i'd assume
[12:59:11] <danheberden> or at least hope? haha
[12:59:19] <hlve> haha
[12:59:26] <danheberden> although that wouldn't be a bad syntax
[12:59:32] <danheberden> like.. give css props in an obj
[12:59:34] <hlve> it wouldn't do anything
[12:59:35] <danheberden> and then if you provide a time
[12:59:37] <danheberden> it animates
[12:59:51] <danheberden> i guess you could do that now with animate
[12:59:54] <danheberden> and just give it 0
[13:00:02] <danheberden> ok, done with the mental masturbation
[13:00:05] <hlve> lol
[13:00:24] <snover> don't stop baby
[13:00:34] <hlve> i was almost finished :(
[13:01:07] <danheberden> hahaha
[13:01:19] <TelFiRE> if you use css3 transitions you can just change the css and the animation time is defined in the css not the js. But if you plan on also doing js animations, this will interfere with eachother
[13:01:25] <danheberden> snover i â™¥ u
[13:01:44] <danheberden> TelFiRE: is that a question or are you stating that?
[13:01:49] <TelFiRE> stating
[13:02:01] <danheberden> YOU WIN A DONKEY
[13:02:12] <danheberden> and aye - hence why something like modernizr is helpful
[13:02:12] <seutje> wish I had a donkey
[13:02:15] * TelFiRE kills the donkey, wraps it in bacon, and deep fries it.
[13:02:25] <danheberden> TelFiRE: i'd hate to see what you'd do with a unicorn
[13:02:31] <seutje> how rude
[13:02:31] * danheberden is glad he didn't give TelFiRE a unicorn
[13:02:37] * TelFiRE pits the unicorn against a narwhal.
[13:02:40] <seutje> some of us actually wanted that donkey as a whole
[13:02:44] <kollapse> hlve, danheberden, Thanks, I didn't know what the 300 did. It's someone else's code.
[13:02:54] <kollapse> And the docs don't explain that param
[13:03:02] <danheberden> kollapse: they do, but as a different signature
[13:03:05] <danheberden> ?css @ kollapse
[13:03:06] <bot-t> kollapse, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:03:13] <danheberden> you can either do .css( propName, value )
[13:03:16] <danheberden> where value would be the 300
[13:03:17] <danheberden> OR
[13:03:22] <danheberden> pass in an object
[13:03:24] <kollapse> Yes, that I know.
[13:03:33] <danheberden> so that was the 300 - like, they probably had 300 in there before
[13:03:36] <danheberden> and then added the object
[13:03:42] <danheberden> and didn't get rid of the 300
[13:03:43] <kollapse> I think he wanted to do an animate() but made a mistake and wrote .css()
[13:03:51] <danheberden> ah, then hlve is correct
[13:04:00] <danheberden> and i concede my kingdom
[13:04:13] <danheberden> that.. that doesn't make sense
[13:04:19] <TelFiRE> yeah exactly I'm guessing it was meant to be animate() in which case it's # of miliseconds the animation should take
[13:04:21] <danheberden> i concede and thus give?
[13:04:23] <danheberden> i donno
[13:04:27] <danheberden> there has to be a better word
[13:04:40] <danheberden> i think 300 was a spartan reference
[13:05:43] <seutje> but this isn't sparta

[13:18:35] <abletony84> At this forum thread layout at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/w47CD/ - how to make all 1st level replies break off like this: http://i.imgur.com/g7KZQ.png ?
[13:25:25] <forlamp> what's the way to have event.target point to the element the click event was defined on?  jQuery docs say it can be the one it was defined on OR a descendant?  I have a click event bound to an <a> tag that wraps an <img> but the event.target poitns to the image, where as the <a> tag wrapping any other text node (h3, etc) the event.target points to the <a> tag...
[13:34:11] <NoiseEee> forlamp: nah
[13:34:23] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/hbu4t/ @ forlamp
[13:34:40] <NoiseEee> event.target is *always* what was actually clicked
[13:36:09] <Absolute0> Is there any event that is fired when the css of an element changes?
[13:39:10] <razzi> Absolute0, any css property ?
[13:39:33] <Absolute0> just top and left
[13:39:54] <walidvb> hi guys!
[13:40:44] <walidvb> i need a little help debugging something. I'm trying to implement this: http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/18443/using-drupal-7-built-in-jquery-ui-in-my-theme on my website, but i'm using drupal and there can be conflicts.
[13:41:15] <walidvb> I'm pretty sure that i have the right versions of jquery in use, however i get a TypeError: f.easing[i.animatedProperties[this.prop]] is not a function
[13:41:26] <razzi> Absolute0, you could poll periodically, maybe there's another way i don't know of though
[13:41:27] <mordocai_work> Hello, i am using https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch to make it where https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid works on touch devices. It works perfectly, except it makes no attempt at implementing double click. Anyone know of a library that does something similar and has double click functionality? Otherwise, I am prepared to modify it to handle double click but i'm not sure how.
[13:43:41] <Absolute0> razzi: The thing is, I have lots of code that changes the top and left css properties of a particular element. I need to add a call to all of these places to do something extra. It would be nicer to have a trigger do that instead.
[13:44:13] <Absolute0> I'll just make myCss method that does that..
[13:45:38] <razzi> Absoltue0, yeah that's much better
[13:58:34] <offlim> can someone tell me what would cause ie to open a pop when a button is clicked but when I drop it from a dropdown it blocks the pop up, you can see the example right here. http://jsfiddle.net/uyeq3/
[13:59:12] <offlim> popup works fine on every other browser btw but not in ie
[14:03:07] <offlim> Hello?
[14:09:31] <BillCriswell> offlim: YOOOO.
[14:10:34] <offlim> yeah
[14:10:47] <BillCriswell> It blocks my popup in Chrome too.
[14:10:49] <BillCriswell> Thank god.
[14:13:04] <BillCriswell> offlim: Not sure you want to trigger it on option click. You probably want it on select change.
[14:13:05] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/uyeq3/2/
[14:13:46] <offlim> nope, that didnt work
[14:15:34] <offlim> any other suggestions?
[14:18:52] <forlamp> does IE9+ support   event.currentTarget ?
[14:21:27] <BillCriswell> offlim: Doubt you'll get around the popup blocking in an easy way.
[14:21:40] <BillCriswell> forlamp: Totally should.
[14:24:31] <Kambfhase> ?hi @ bot-t
[14:24:32] <bot-t> bot-t, :)

[14:25:35] <Kambfhase> Hm, bot-t doesnt seem to like beer.
[14:25:38] <BillCriswell> forlamp: Sure you're not looking for something else?
[14:27:17] <forlamp> well event.target isn't reliable since it doens't point to the element the event was defined on, however currentTarget seems to give me what iw ant in FF/Chrome/Safari
[14:28:19] <NoiseEee> forlamp: why so concerned with what the event was defined on?
[14:29:41] <BillCriswell> forlamp: $(this) would be currentTarget... I believe?
[14:29:44] <danheberden> and i'm confused because .on manages what was bound?
[14:29:47] <forlamp> need to access the href attribute of the link near the element that fired the click event
[14:29:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/SUSEX/2/ This should log "mom"
[14:30:10] <forlamp> billcriswell; nah 'this' is different in AngularJS than it normally is
[14:30:20] <danheberden> .on( 'eventName', 'a', function( event ) { /* event.target is element that dispatched event, `this` is the 'a' */ });
[14:30:26] <danheberden> oh, angular
[14:30:37] <danheberden> yummy
[14:30:38] <forlamp> danhebereden; you would think so... but
[14:31:21] <L1> How would I go about wrapping every ® (R) character on my page in a span?
[14:31:22] <forlamp> api.jquery.com/event.target/  states "The target property can be the element that registered for the event or a descendant of it."  which is poop cuz i don't want that uncertainty of the "or a descendant of it"
[14:32:35] <danheberden> forlamp: if this is a jquery event, you a) have access to the originalEvent object
[14:32:40] <danheberden> and b) have `delegateTarget`
[14:33:23] <danheberden> .target isn't unique to jQ though
[14:33:28] <danheberden> it's just the element that dispatched the event
[14:33:33] <Kambfhase> L1: simply regexp document.body.innerHTMl and replace it
[14:33:40] <danheberden> that doc is just saying something if it bubbled up and was caught
[14:33:44] <danheberden> target would still be the original element
[14:33:50] <forlamp> yeah delegateTarget was pointing to the same thing as 'currentTarget' in my debugging -- that's not the issue though, just wondering if IE9 supported event.currentTarget / delegateTarget  -- or if jQuery fills those in in IE for me
[14:33:54] <forlamp> danheberden; it's not
[14:34:15] <danheberden> forlamp, it's not a jQ event?
[14:34:24] <forlamp> danhebereden; targe tis not the original element
[14:34:29] <forlamp> s/targe/target
[14:34:36] <danheberden> what is "original"
[14:34:41] <danheberden> the one you bound to?
[14:34:44] <forlamp> you tell me you used the term lol
[14:34:45] <danheberden> or the thing you interacted with?
[14:34:48] <L1> Kambfhase: Thank you very much
[14:34:52] <forlamp> but yes, i wanted the one it was bound to
[14:35:01] <forlamp> which i have achieved now
[14:35:06] <forlamp> just gotta test IE
[14:35:11] <BillCriswell> forlamp: Using what?
[14:35:11] <danheberden> 'target' is the element that had the 'original' event - say, an <a> in a <div>
[14:35:18] <danheberden> you click the a, and a fires an event
[14:35:20] <danheberden> it's the target
[14:35:30] <danheberden> but if you bound on('click') on the <div>
[14:35:34] <danheberden> that event handler will fire
[14:35:41] <danheberden> with the currentTarget of <div>
[14:35:54] <danheberden> because that is what actually dispatched the bubbled event
[14:36:03] <danheberden> but target is what fired it originally
[14:36:26] <danheberden> so sometimes, in that event handler, target will be <div> because you didn't click an <a>
[14:36:44] <danheberden> or it will be the <a> - so target doesn't always equal currentTarget, depending on what happened
[14:36:50] <danheberden> namely, if the event bubbled or not
[14:37:04] <danheberden> regardless of framework, this principle stays intact
[14:37:08] <fission6> anyone recommend a little toggle type widget to toggle between two settings?
[14:37:20] <Kambfhase> ver bool = !1;
[14:37:23] <BillCriswell> fission6: A checkbox? =)
[14:37:29] <Kambfhase> A boolean?
[14:37:38] <danheberden> BillCriswell++
[14:38:06] <danheberden> fission6: http://jsbin.com/efakuy/12/edit
[14:38:11] <danheberden> note, don't actually use that
[14:38:54] <fission6> danheberden: nice close to what i want
[14:39:04] <fission6> really like the little slider stripe.com has
[14:40:26] <fission6> nice http://jsfiddle.net/joshnh/evePU/
[14:40:51] <BillCriswell> forlamp: This is the clearest I can think of explaining it? this will always be .mother since it's how the event is attached. http://jsfiddle.net/7Lz3h/
[14:41:02] <BillCriswell> unless I'm totally mistaking something. Which is the case usually.
[14:41:06] <forlamp> i figured out my issue
[14:41:26] <BillCriswell> forlamp: Mind me asking with what?
[14:43:16] <forlamp> i know how events fire/bubble/capture/etc, that wasn't the problem... the root problem was the person who wrote the HTML   in two different variants.... <a ...><img /></a>   and <div><a ...>text</a></div>  for items without images, so that's why i was seeing differnt values for event.target lol.
[14:43:44] <BillCriswell> Ah, ok!
[14:43:59] <forlamp> so i just wasted an hour lol
[14:44:01] <danheberden> forlamp: ha - sorry if i assumed you didn't know
[14:44:06] <danheberden> or, rather, that i assumed
[14:44:06] <forlamp> when i coulda looked at their html lol
[14:44:13] <danheberden> though maybe someone else learned about it by reading?
[14:44:19] <BillCriswell> forlamp: I've spent 2 hours on much simpler.
[14:44:51] <forlamp> danheberden; hopefully!
[14:45:01] <forlamp> BillCriswell; such is the life of a coder :)
[14:45:13] <BillCriswell> danheberden: I actually don't understand it anymore after reading it.
[14:45:26] <danheberden>  /kick BillCriswell
[14:45:29] <BillCriswell> You've reversed my understanding. =)
[14:45:32] <danheberden> heh
[14:46:12] <forlamp> events in non-ie browsers take two propagation paths (capture from defaultView down to event.target -- then on event.target -- then from event.target bubbling up to defaultView) -- Ie only does the bubble part
[14:46:15] <forlamp> bam event order in 1 line
[14:48:01] <BillCriswell> forlamp: Sounds good to me.
[14:48:55] <forlamp> did netscape ONLY do event capture back in the 90's?
[14:49:14] <forlamp> until w3c came in and said, 'yo, do both capture & bubble' ?
[14:49:34] <BillCriswell> forlamp: Honestly don't know.
[14:49:52] <goddard> if i have a <button>text here</button> how do i get that text in the middle of the tags
[14:49:56] <goddard> is that .text()?
[14:50:03] <BillCriswell> goddard: You bet.
[14:50:11] <goddard> ok
[14:53:12] <forlamp> anyone got a good stream to listen to while coding? :P
[14:54:22] <BillCriswell> forlamp: I've been on a Talking Heads kick recently... so I'd definitely be biased towards that.
[14:55:07] <BillCriswell> forlamp: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ9u4yrjvY Amazing all around!
[14:56:44] <danheberden> forlamp: if you like electronic crap the tron soundtrack is a pretty good working selection
[14:56:51] <zfly9> Hey guys I have http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/ and there are some jQuery rotating div's in the bottom left. In FireFox they are a little glitchy any ideas?

[15:09:30] <fission6> abletony84: thats quite a fiddle
[15:13:09] <forlamp> is box going to be a div or an img in practice?
[15:14:05] <abletony94> forlamp: it's gonna be a div ul li img
[15:15:37] <TelFiRE> http://urgent.cpstest1.info/ I have a problem where if you resize the sidebar, then resize the browser to a small width, then resize it back to normal, it won't flip back to the non-mobile. If you just refresh the page and resize browser it works as expected, but once the sidebar is resized it no longer works. I have console.logs showing up, plus it's correctly changing the class of an element, so I know my function is running, it's just completely ignoring
[15:15:37] <TelFiRE> of the commands for no apparent reason.

[15:28:50] <ssapphiree> Hey guys. Does anybody know a good jquery color picker plugin? I've only found http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/ looking pretty good, but it's quite old (last update 3.5 years ago), and other options are even older...
[15:29:36] <raj> shoky?
[15:29:53] <MistuhKurtz> anybody know a resource on jquery optimization that reflects the current state of browsers?
[15:30:04] <MistuhKurtz> (I'm curious if there's still any need to worry about optimizing selectors)
[15:32:29] <systemfault> MistuhKurtz: Nah, just always cache selectors into variables whenever you have the chance.
[15:32:44] <MistuhKurtz> yup
[15:32:45] <forlamp> problem is your  div.wrapper is wrapping ALL replies and keeping them to the right (can see by inspect element), you only want to wrap a 'group' of replies that are in reply to each other i suspect and not the entire reply set (since the whole reply set has top-level replies)
[15:33:20] <MistuhKurtz> figured, thanks systemfault
[15:35:31] <abletony94> forlamp: i have some code that attempts to move all 2nd level elements to the left but honestly i dont know what im doing
[15:35:58] <abletony94> i guess ill start working on that beat
[15:36:14] <TelFiRE> Anyone know of a paid support resource for jQuery? I have a gnarly bug.
[15:36:47] <forlamp> abletony; i'll be able to help more in about 2hrs when i get home from work
[15:37:01] <forlamp> i *think* it's just an html structure issue at first glance
[15:38:40] <Frantic> guys, I'm trying to write a small 1-page html app with a bit of jquery that loads in file:// and GET's a URL and extracts the links to make them show nicer, but I cannot GET from the specific domain due to no CORS entry, is there a way to work around it given that the document is file://  ?
[15:38:44] <abletony94> i see
[15:38:51] <forlamp> actually
[15:38:52] <forlamp> here you go
[15:38:54] <forlamp> http://jsfiddle.net/2KP7G/5/
[15:39:48] <Frantic> I've tried adding a <script type="text/x-fetch" src="http://domain/path_to_page"> but it's innerHtml is empty
[15:40:45] <systemfault> Frantic: You really cannot install apache? :/
[15:42:15] <Frantic> systemfault: how does installing apache help me?
[15:42:24] <forlamp> so you can serve the file thru HTTP
[15:42:37] <systemfault> Frantic: Like forlamp said :/
[15:42:37] <forlamp> instea dof using the sandboxed file:// protocol with very restrictive permissions
[15:43:02] <Frantic> I can, but I still don't see how that helps me, the target I'm trying to $.get still doesn't have CORS headers
[15:43:25] <Frantic> I've tried accesing it with a non-file:// url, didn't help
[15:43:50] <Frantic> http://localhost:8000/
[15:44:09] <forlamp> albetony; that work?
[15:44:54] <Frantic> I just have this simple thing I wanted to do, and I was hoping to do it without running another script to pull the pages :)
[15:45:54] <abletony94> forlamp: damn man what'd you do? :)
[15:47:14] <forlamp> abletony94; changed how you use  <div class="wrapper">
[15:47:33] <forlamp> just wrapped each "grouping" of replies, so you basicalyl have 1 wrapper per top-level post and it encapsulates all the child replies to it
[15:49:23] <abletony94> hmmm nice
[15:50:04] <abletony94> forlamp: great
[15:50:20] <abletony94> :)
[15:50:50] <abletony94> your beat is coming right up
[15:52:55] <abletony94> forlamp: i dont have all my stuff here though
[15:53:48] <forlamp> fruityloops or ableton live? :P
[15:54:23] <oakho> live ftw

[16:23:35] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/tYmk4/
[16:23:45] <joshsmith> I have these hover events, and one is delayed by the other
[16:24:00] <joshsmith> I'm struggling to remember how to order the events so this doesn't happen
[16:24:40] <joshsmith> basically, hover over the right side of the red #outer, then hover over the yellow #inner, and move the mouse off both at once, and you'll get a staggered effect
[16:24:49] <joshsmith> the opposite happens mousing directly onto #inner
[16:25:31] <abletony94> forlamp: whats the url to your youtube thing?
[16:40:46] <gabrieluk> hi there, I'm facing a little mission. I'm using a certain jquery plugin(sticky) that genrates a fixed element in the page. the problem is that the wrapper that is generated by the plugin have a default of a height property in px. I need to change that height to 100%. any ideas? https://github.com/garand/sticky/blob/master/jquery.sticky.js
[16:44:10] <coldhead> gabrieluk: can you just select the generated element and set the height desired?
[16:44:22] <coldhead> $('#stick_or_whatever').css('height', '100%')
[16:44:34] <coldhead> there is evidently some subtle nuance i am failing to grasp
[16:44:38] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[16:44:56] <gabrieluk> coldhead, oh yeah, i was using only the classes x.x
[16:45:05] <gabrieluk> but look, i found what i wanted documentHeight = $document.height(),
[16:45:07] <joshsmith> I have these hover events, and one is delayed by the other. I'm struggling to remember how to order the events so this doesn't happen. basically, hover over the right side of the red #outer, then hover over the yellow #inner, and move the mouse off both at once, and you'll get a staggered effect http://jsfiddle.net/tYmk4/
[16:45:58] <gabrieluk> i mean, what could possibily change, if i had to do that change in the code bSase
[16:45:59] <joshsmith> I can get it to stop the staggered event on mouseleave by calling .stop(true, true)
[16:46:32] <joshsmith> but not on mouse enter
[16:47:15] <ryanneufeld> joshsmith: change to .stop().fadeTo()
[16:47:40] <joshsmith> ryanneufeld: for each one?
[16:47:53] <ryanneufeld> joshsmith: yes, http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/tYmk4/1/
[16:48:36] <joshsmith> ryanneufeld: when you hover over the inner, though, the intent is for the opacity to go to 1
[16:48:37] <coldhead> gabrieluk: you might need to fiddle up a demo for this, i am not sure what you are going for here
[16:48:59] <joshsmith> ryanneufeld: in your update it only goes to 0.7
[16:49:13] <raj> coldhead, I would appreciate your opinion on something, but not jq related
[16:49:20] <gabrieluk> coldhead, no worries. I was just thinking how the plugin was outputting the height for the given div wrap
[16:49:32] <ryanneufeld> joshsmith: That's because the outer is doing it's thing first
[16:50:12] <joshsmith> how can I delegate down to the inner in that event?
[16:50:20] <ryanneufeld> joshsmith: event.target
[16:50:33] <ryanneufeld> joshsmith: you can tell which element triggered the event
[16:50:50] <ryanneufeld> or rather, correctly said, on which element the event was triggered
[16:50:59] <ryanneufeld> afk
[17:00:32] <gabrieluk> coldhead, it doesn't work with the id #. it gets an override, element.style {
[17:00:54] <abletony94> forlamp: http://soundcloud.com/abletony84/forlamp
[17:01:08] <gabrieluk> coldhead, i make a fidle
[17:04:02] <raj> ::sigh:: no one wants to offer their opinions!
[17:06:18] <dexec> Hey guys, what's the standard way to validate forms w/ jQuery nowadays? Just write it yourself? All the plugins I'm seeing look very outdated.
[17:06:48] <coldhead> i get by with html5 validation attributes
[17:06:58] <coldhead> type="email" required="required"
[17:07:04] <coldhead> type="number" etc
[17:11:26] <gabrieluk> coldhead, here, http://jsfiddle.net/gabrieluk/NkqJk/
[17:14:19] <coldhead> gabrieluk: http://jsfiddle.net/NkqJk/1/ ?
[17:17:12] <gabrieluk> what have you done, apart the colors? also, i found this  etse = elementTop - s.topSpacing - extra;
[17:17:22] <gabrieluk> etse seems a typo to me ^^
[17:18:15] <forlamp> aha nice
[17:18:20] <forlamp> bbl
[17:18:43] <gabrieluk> coldhead, oh yea! you did it!how?
[17:18:51] <gabrieluk> now it gets 100%
[17:22:12] <gabrieluk> nice one,       $('#sticker-sticky-wrapper').height('100%');
[17:22:12] <gabrieluk>  :)
[17:22:20] <coldhead> yeah, too easy huh?
[17:22:41] <coldhead> it MIGHT reset the height again if you resize the window
[17:22:44] <gabrieluk> yes, it was very. i didn't know about that trick, thanks:)
[17:22:58] <coldhead> in which case you might like to add a resize handler that catches the resize and sets the height again
[17:22:58] <gabrieluk> aha, that was the main problem -_-
[17:23:53] <abletony94> forlamp: yeah me too thanks again man
[17:24:11] <coldhead> gabrieluk: http://jsfiddle.net/NkqJk/2/
[17:25:17] <gabrieluk> cool, you wrapped in an anonymous function
[17:25:26] <gabrieluk> amazing
[17:28:47] <gabrieluk> it is an argument of the method resize..mm,
[17:29:40] <coldhead> ?resize
[17:29:40] <bot-t> .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[17:30:49] <gabrieluk> .trigger('resize'); it trigger the method being called? what 'resize' is doing there?
[17:32:34] <gabrieluk> scratch that, it is a confusing question
[17:32:45] <gabrieluk> i should read a bit about them ^^
[17:35:17] <gabrieluk> coldhead, i do understand what resize is doing, is just really the trigger methosd that I don't get it. I mean, I don't get it, like easily, without reading, that is wht i mean.
[17:37:02] <gabrieluk> oh, i see now, http://api.jquery.com/trigger/  , it actually triggers the resize methos ^^
[17:37:15] <gabrieluk> method*
[17:37:33] <xec> event*
[17:38:22] <gabrieluk> oh, event, sure
[17:38:24] <coldhead> yes, so the height gets set whenever the window resizes AND straight away the first time
[17:38:43] <coldhead> it says "here's what to do when the window resizes AND ALSO DO IT RIGHT NOW DAMN YOU"
[17:39:05] <coldhead> it's lazyness, really, so i only had to write the line that actually sets the height once
[17:39:06] <gabrieluk> yup :D
[17:39:57] <fission6> why woul dsomeone do something like this !function ($) { whats the point of the "!"
[17:40:30] <gabrieluk> !, means NO. so  would be "it is not a fucntion.."
[17:40:49] <gabrieluk> used in IF statments
[17:41:01] <gabrieluk> statements*
[17:41:02] <xec> fission6: does it end with }() ?
[17:42:11] <coldhead> fission6: search hear for !function and scroll back up to read why http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[17:42:13] <coldhead> here*
[17:42:19] <xec> fission6: basically it's one (of many) ways to create an iife
[17:42:27] <xec> like coldhead said
[17:43:19] <xec> i'm guessing the end of the function is "}(jQuery)"
[17:55:46] <say2joe> using ! requires the least amount of bytecode while ensuring the expression is invoked and returns a value if (during concatenation) it might get assigned to another variable.
[17:57:26] <say2joe> in this case â€¦ it evaluates to true if no return statement is provided var myTrueValue = !function(){}();
[17:58:14] <say2joe> all functions when invoked return a value (of undefined if omitted) regardless of whether or not there's a return statement.
[18:01:11] <MrPunkin> Has anyone here seen issues where if you issue an $.getJSON but refresh the main page that requested the JSON the browser renders the raw JSON instead of the actual page? Like it changed the browsers history state to request the JSON format or something
[18:05:07] <gabrieluk> coldhead, that code have a quirk, have a look in the very moment when it gets sticky http://jsfiddle.net/NkqJk/3/
[18:05:28] <gabrieluk> it kinda makes a bump with the div below
[18:05:41] <gabrieluk> it is not a smoth transition
[18:06:31] <coldhead> does it behave like that withouth the 100% bit i added?
[18:06:41] <gabrieluk> not sure, leeme check
[18:08:37] <gabrieluk> i tried like this, it is not bumping anymore, but, i'm not sure about the first issue http://jsfiddle.net/NkqJk/4/
[18:11:20] <gabrieluk> the height is now asit was before, in px. I guess it makes sense, as i removed the .height('100%');
[18:11:21] <coldhead> i thinlk i know what's occurring
[18:11:37] <coldhead> i think the plugin creates some empty space at the top of the page
[18:11:43] <coldhead> which appears behind the sticky element
[18:11:48] <coldhead> so the rest of the page still sits in place
[18:11:56] <coldhead> and our code changes the height of the sticky element
[18:12:12] <coldhead> but the code is still using the old value for the height of the space it creates
[18:12:16] <coldhead> which is why is jumots
[18:12:31] <someprimetime> oh man i hate writing those things
[18:12:33] <gabrieluk> mm, yes, i follow
[18:15:08] <gabrieluk> coldhead, i will play first with the css, to make sure
[18:17:05] <gabrieluk> naa, nothing, it is as you say. is something inside the plugin
[18:39:25] <gabrieluk> coldhead, no worries, i will open a ticket with the plugin developer and show him our code. he must know easily
[18:45:40] <iateadonut> what's the way to get the most web-browsers to open link in new tab on clicking a link?
[18:48:08] <jexmex> anybody have any experience implementing mediaplayer.js?
[18:48:32] <jexmex> specifically setting it up to stream from a shoutcast server
[18:49:15] <_cb> Am reading html  from various folder using PHP, passing it back to the web page via ajax and using jquery to populate a div. Problem is that images don't display.  Is there a way to set a path for an <img?
[18:50:30] <coldhead> _cb: <base>
[18:52:04] <_cb> coldhead <base> ?
[18:52:18] <coldhead> _cb: <base>
[18:52:20] <coldhead> yes
[18:52:36] <coldhead> http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/base
[18:52:38] <coldhead> and so on
[18:55:01] <_cb> coldhead that may work. Thanks! Just asked the same question in #html and non one mentioned base.
[18:55:29] <coldhead> well, those sad individuals are spending their free time in #html
[18:55:37] <coldhead> so...
[19:01:13] <grafi> cheap shot coldhead ^^
[19:01:37] <coldhead> it really isn't
[19:01:46] <coldhead> people who are passionate about a mark up language are weird
[19:02:03] <coldhead> i love the work they do but i won't socialise with them
[19:02:10] <coldhead> or sit next to them on a bus
[19:02:46] <grafi> how would you know whether or not you sit next to one on the bus :o
[19:03:11] <coldhead> i assume they're wearing those tshirts that say <body> on the front and </body> on the back
[19:03:39] <ajpiano> you know those people are just posers coldhead
[19:03:40] <grafi> and the <head></head> hat
[19:03:55] <ajpiano> the hardcore people wear a necklace that says <body> and socks that say </body>
[19:04:39] <coldhead> "excuse me sir, is this seat free and may i see your socks?"
[19:04:51] <grafi> ^^
[19:05:18] <grafi> i think i should go join #html and see what they talk about all day :o
[19:05:23] <Alpha64> xml people go around with empty boxes
[19:05:51] <_cb> So is XHR more appropiate term than Ajax?
[19:06:06] <grafi> ajaj
[19:06:07] <Alpha64> ajax sounds way cooler
[19:06:48] <_cb> Was just instructed in #html that XHR is the correct term and Ajax obsolete.
[19:07:02] <_cb> Ok off to try the <base suggestion
[19:07:12] <grafi> good luck
[19:17:20] <adlwalrus> _cb_afk: really, it should be "ajaj", now.
[19:17:39] <grafi> but that sounds silly :D
[19:17:56] <adlwalrus> grafi: who cares?
[19:18:01] <grafi> me
[19:18:02] <grafi> :O
[19:18:10] <grafi> that should be enough
[19:18:11] <grafi> :D
[19:18:20] <coldhead> that makes you beautiful, grafi
[19:18:26] <adlwalrus> grafi: that was kind facetious, though, btw.
[19:19:35] <grafi> i couldnt tell if you held up a sign :P
[19:21:37] <grafi> dont argue with the dude who surfs without js enabled _cb_afk
[19:21:37] <grafi> ^^
[19:21:55] <coldhead> ew that's so evil
[19:24:19] <cirenyc> I am trying to use slideDown on an image that is hidden.  It's coming in on a diagonal from the top left.  Is this normal behavior or is something off?
[19:24:35] <cirenyc> It seems like slideDown would drop the image from top to bottom.
[19:25:14] <grafi> oO
[19:25:31] <adlwalrus> grafi: who are yoou referring to?
[19:27:13] <grafi> to the guy in #html _cb just had a conversation with about the importance of javascript to the modern internet ^^
[19:27:24] <grafi> who surfs with js disabled
[19:27:25] <grafi> apparently
[19:35:32] <coldhead> people who disable JS are ruining the internet
[19:35:40] <coldhead> and they deserve non-working sites
[19:35:43] <coldhead> i will never cater to them
[19:35:48] <coldhead> NEVERS
[19:36:54] <grafi> yeah, its crazy
[19:39:45] <gabrieluk> coldhead, i think i found it.                     stickyWrapper.css('height', stickyElement.outerHeight()); line 77
[19:40:02] <coldhead> that looks like it could be it!
[19:40:15] <gabrieluk> :D
[19:42:44] <gabrieluk> yeahhh. i just commented the line, and it works!
[19:45:54] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[19:45:56] <coldhead> good job
[19:46:22] <grafi> always good when something works :p
[19:47:02] <gabrieluk> coldhead, thanks. it is most your credit anyway, i couldn't get there without your insights :)
[19:47:16] <coldhead> pish, gabrieluk. i did nothing
[19:47:18] <tw2113> aww coldhead is helping people already
[19:47:24] <tw2113> fast learner
[19:47:25] <coldhead> you should bill me for wasting your time
[19:47:31] <gabrieluk> haha
[19:47:41] <tw2113> i do
[19:47:51] <tw2113> it's helping me get a full monopoly board game again
[19:47:59] <tw2113> i lost all the money in a freak night on vegas
[19:50:02] <coldhead> you should try and win it back
[19:50:08] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[19:50:17] <Alpha64> i'm so lost with this, how can i select an element containing $(something).data('id') === 'some string' ?
[19:51:01] <tw2113> var foo = $(something).data('id') ?
[19:51:02] <say2joe> $("#idString")
[19:51:29] <tw2113> say2joe, it looks like he's dealing with a data attribute
[19:51:30] <tw2113> data-id
[19:51:31] <say2joe> that's a very weird questionâ€¦ considering the fundamentals of jQuery
[19:51:36] <coldhead> $('something[data-id="some string"]')
[19:51:39] <coldhead> if it's in the HTML
[19:51:39] <say2joe> ohâ€¦ yeah
[19:51:58] <coldhead> otherwise you need to use ?filter()
[19:51:58] <bot-t1> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[19:52:00] <tw2113> good point coldhead
[19:52:02] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[19:52:10] <Alpha64> trying it
[19:52:12] <tw2113> forgot about selecting if the id was set to that string
[19:52:15] <say2joe> $("element").filter("[data-id=something")
[19:52:30] <say2joe> or what coldhead said.
[19:53:12] <say2joe> it's more efficient to filter data attributes though, i thinkâ€¦ someone correct me if i'm wrong?
[19:53:56] <coldhead> i was thinking more $(something).find('*').filter(function () { return $(this).data('id') === 'some string'; })
[19:54:00] <say2joe> anyone seen a jsperf on $("element").filter("[data-id=something]") vs $("element[data-id=something]")?
[19:54:05] <Alpha64> and how can i interpolate the $(this) element ?
[19:54:56] <Alpha64> as in $( this + "[data-id="some string"])
[19:55:06] <gabrieluk> ups, fake alarm, still does x.x. anyway, i made a ticket for the developer already, dang, i was so happy...then...
[19:57:59] <coldhead> gabrieluk: if i'm aroiund tomorrow remind me and i might be bothered to try to fix it
[19:58:04] <coldhead> depending on what's on tv
[19:58:17] <coldhead> and how i'm going with my anti-depressants
[19:59:03] <say2joe> http://jsperf.com/filter-vs-selector-on-data-attribute
[19:59:13] <gabrieluk> lol, no worries. i won't make you go trough that pain :)
[19:59:43] <say2joe> I just created that perf testâ€¦ but, if anyone has suggestions on making it more thorough
[20:00:16] <gabrieluk> coldhead, hold on, i had an idea
[20:00:57] <coldhead> good test, say2joe
[20:00:59] <gabrieluk> if  //stickyWrapper.css('height', stickyElement.outerHeight()); is setting the "style" height in the css
[20:01:03] <tw2113> explains the boom i heard gabrieluk
[20:01:06] <enderx86> question, what does $ mean?
[20:01:26] <coldhead> $ denotes a popular form of currency
[20:01:29] <gabrieluk> would it be possible to change  stickyElement.outerHeight(), by 100%?
[20:01:39] <say2joe> coldhead: ROFL
[20:01:40] <coldhead> it's similar to your drachme or ruble
[20:01:46] <Alpha64> $('#partes[data-id="'+ $(this).data("id") +'"]').load( does this makes sense?
[20:01:59] <say2joe> i'm going to add a bunch of divs to make it more real-world.
[20:02:17] <coldhead> it's not very readable, Alpha64
[20:02:34] <coldhead> but yeah that does what you want
[20:02:57] <_cb> hmm... <base> is not going to work. Breaks the site. Looks as if I am going to have to parse every <img and change the source
[20:03:01] <enderx86> seriously - is $ a global reference?
[20:03:42] <enderx86> i have a background in java/c/python, but not javascript
[20:04:05] <coldhead> enderx86: it's an alias for the global jQuery object/function
[20:04:15] <enderx86> thanks
[20:04:19] <coldhead> $('selector_goes_here') and so on
[20:04:23] <enderx86> now, how can an object also be a function
[20:04:32] <coldhead> because Javascript is very very strange
[20:04:48] <coldhead> probably best not to try to understand. just do it and ypu'll get used to it
[20:04:59] <enderx86> ok
[20:05:10] <coldhead> it seldom matters, it Just Works
[20:05:30] <gabrieluk> coldhead, would you recommend me replicate this functionality from scratch other than trying to debug plugins? I mean, i'm a beginner, but i know js and the fundaments..I'm wondering how the code base of those plugins around really are
[20:06:19] <gabrieluk> i mean, it shouldn't be a drama to crate a "sticky" div
[20:06:58] <Alpha64> does jquery-ui allow you to put accordions inside accordions inside accordions?
[20:07:03] <say2joe> coldhead: not much difference in results, but a lil' better test case: http://jsperf.com/filter-vs-selector-on-data-attribute
[20:07:32] <coldhead> gabrieluk: what you really should do is fork the proejct on github, make it better then you'll have solved the problem for yourself AND FOR ANYONE ELSE THAT EVER HAS IT IN HISTORY
[20:07:40] <coldhead> it
[20:07:44] <coldhead> s a nice small plugn
[20:07:47] <coldhead> understandable
[20:07:50] <coldhead> it won't be too hard :)
[20:08:09] <coldhead> i can say that because I MERGED A PULL REQUEST TODAY AND NOW I FEEL LIKE A GOD
[20:08:18] <shoky> o_m_g
[20:08:23] <enderx86> coldhead: what does that mean?
[20:08:30] <enderx86> #startedjavascript3daysago
[20:08:32] <shoky> did you make them revise it first??
[20:08:33] <grafi> and his shift key has gone mad

[20:09:56] <grafi> Like if you agree ^^
[20:10:00] <coldhead> what does what mean, enderx86 ?
[20:10:08] <enderx86> merged a pull request?
[20:10:09] <shoky> for you to be a god
[20:10:37] <coldhead> oh on github, enderx86
[20:10:47] <coldhead> someone improved my code and submitted it back to me
[20:10:51] <say2joe> I've been on the Internet for 20 years and just learned what idgaf means.
[20:10:54] <coldhead> and i incorporated it into the main code
[20:11:07] <enderx86> oh, cool
[20:11:18] <coldhead> enderx86: are you reading these guys? http://jqfundamentals.com and http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[20:11:33] <enderx86> no! but thanks, i'll have to start reading them
[20:11:52] <|PiP|> anyone know of a good wysiwyg-to-markdown or other templating engine converter that uses jquery?
[20:11:54] <gabrieluk> yes, in theory it sounds good :).  I'm just really a beginner, and to be honest i get lost in that code base.  so for me it sounds a big challenge
[20:12:03] <coldhead> jqf is good if you need to get stuff working NOW, eloquent is good if you want to learn what's up with js weirdness
[20:12:28] <coldhead> gabrieluk: sure man, in which case redoing it from scratch is probably a big job
[20:12:45] <coldhead> gabrieluk: i would seriously let #jQuery help you try to tweak the plugin and share it on github
[20:12:49] <coldhead> people won't bite
[20:12:53] <coldhead> and you'll be proud
[20:12:59] <say2joe> var goodBook = /(?!bad) book/.test("Eloquent JavaScript book");

[20:13:23] <coldhead> you people take care
[20:13:27] <gabrieluk> ok, i see what i can do
[20:13:28] <say2joe> I'm workin' on a bottle of bourbon right now
[20:13:38] <a215> let's say i have $(".container"), containing $(".inactive"), $(".active"), and $(".inactive")
[20:13:45] <a215> what'st he correct way to say
[20:13:49] <a215> take the next inactive after active
[20:13:52] <a215> that loops around
[20:13:53] <grafi> like carving it out of a glass block say2joe

[20:15:01] <a215> fourcolors: .click(function(event){ ... event.preventDefault();});
[20:15:01] <say2joe> gift for my birthday 2 days ago
[20:15:27] <fourcolors> a215: How do I add attributes to the request then redirect?
[20:15:33] <a215> that i don't know
[20:15:36] <tw2113> ?attr @ fourcolors

[20:17:55] <fourcolors> someprimetime: ah.. so set the href link to something with variables in it?
[20:18:10] <fourcolors> is it possible to post the link kind of like a form?

[20:27:00] <fourcolors> someprimetime: the problem is I have a rails controller that is expecting a request
[20:27:23] <fourcolors> ill give it a go
[20:28:09] <someprimetime> yeah
[20:28:22] <say2joe> other than jQuery proprietary convenience selectors, can anyone provide a valid reason for using the filter() method any longer (given the drop in IE7 browser usage worldwide)?
[20:28:24] <someprimetime> how long have you been doing MVC based stuff
[20:28:33] <someprimetime> you'll need a route which maps to your controller in rails
[20:28:39] <someprimetime> a route, is simply put a URL
[20:28:44] <someprimetime> when you POST, you POST to that route
[20:28:59] <someprimetime> the router will hit your controller which will run your rails method
[20:29:02] <someprimetime> that method will do something
[20:29:06] <someprimetime> maybe pass back some json
[20:29:24] <someprimetime> in that $.post() callback you'll get the object in the form of `data`
[20:29:27] <fourcolors> someprimetime: right, well I want to be able to just render the new page with the @map attributes
[20:29:49] <fourcolors> I want in my controller to be able to do @map = params[:map]
[20:30:25] <someprimetime> i've never used rails but that looks like some kind of replacement for a parameter?
[20:30:49] <fourcolors> oh yes, when you do a post to a rails controller it puts the parameters into a params hash
[20:31:23] <fourcolors> the problem is when I get the callback json from that post request, then redirect, my json will get lost because the page will reload
[20:31:28] <fourcolors> if that makes sense
[20:31:50] <fourcolors> so basically I just want this link to act kind of like a regular post from  form
[20:31:57] <fourcolors> or to ake like a get request from a form
[20:32:09] <fourcolors> cause I'm not really saving anything, I'm just saving the state of the map
[20:32:19] <fourcolors> to be saved again ... kind of thing
[20:32:52] <someprimetime> well so you need to save json is what you are sayingâ€¦ why not store it with rails?
[20:32:54] <someprimetime> in a session
[20:33:04] <someprimetime> or cookie / localStorage in javascript
[20:33:16] <fourcolors> that could work
[20:33:18] <someprimetime> i mean you can't really have persistent data if you refresh the page
[20:33:24] <someprimetime> unless you do that
[20:33:33] <fourcolors> right, i just need to send it along with the requst
[20:33:38] <someprimetime> i'd personally go with a session since i like to handle most data on the server
[20:34:00] <someprimetime> but then you'd have to grab it with rails, so it depends on your intent
[20:34:05] <fourcolors> is there no way of turning a link into a form in js?
[20:34:37] <fourcolors> so I'm basically just bootstrapping the map data on the next page to be  rendered
[20:35:03] <someprimetime> what do you mean form?
[20:35:22] <fourcolors>  well I want the link to work just like how a form would work
[20:35:30] <someprimetime> put it in the URL?
[20:35:34] <fourcolors> you have attributes (hidden)
[20:35:40] <fourcolors> that could work
[20:35:54] <someprimetime> it will most certainly work. that's how most websites work
[20:36:04] <someprimetime> then in your controller you just grab the args
[20:36:08] <someprimetime> i gotta go though so good luck
[20:36:15] <fourcolors> is there an easy way to do that in jquery
[20:36:49] <fourcolors> other than modifying the url
[20:36:53] <fourcolors> directly i mean
[20:37:28] <someprimetime> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[20:40:03] <fourcolors> oh here we go

[20:41:01] <NCS_One> hi
[20:42:03] <NCS_One> with a jui button buttonset how do I deselect a selected button?
[20:44:56] <Alpha64> anybody knows if the jquery-ui accordion can be nested?
[20:46:46] <a215> how do i select an element of a jquery array of DOM objects by its index, and stll be able to call .fadeIn on it?
[20:47:02] <a215> children[0] gives me an error: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'fadeOut'
[20:48:04] <shoky> a215:  .eq(0)
[20:49:12] <a215> wow it almost works
[20:49:14] <a215> thx
[20:57:51] <a215> is there a .next that loops back to the beginning?
[20:59:55] <a215> n/m
[21:00:13] <beachandbytes> a215 there is a plugin nextorfirst
[21:00:18] <beachandbytes> or you can simply write the functions
[21:00:32] <beachandbytes> nextorfirst, prevorlast
[21:00:34] <a215> yeah it's fine
[21:01:07] <a215> now i just have to make this animation not suck
[21:02:32] <a215> god this looks terrible
[21:02:44] <coldhead> get a faster computer?
[21:02:55] <a215> that ain't the problem
[21:03:04] <coldhead> oh :(
[21:03:19] <a215> it's my shitty coding
[21:03:20] <a215> lol
[21:03:30] <coldhead> are you sure you don't deserve a new gombuter?
[21:03:36] <a215> pretty sure
[21:03:36] <enderx86> can someone explain function hoisting to me?
[21:03:39] <uiuiui32> How do I read the contents of of a JSON POST request in nginx?
[21:03:51] <a215> uiuiui32: probably packet sniffing lol
[21:03:59] <enderx86> why is it better to use var f = function(a, b) {} than function f(a, b) {}
[21:03:59] <a215> or check your firebug/isnpect element console
[21:04:04] <a215> under 'network' or w/e
[21:04:04] <uiuiui32> c'on man
[21:04:31] <uiuiui32> no. I need to save the POSTed data into a db.
[21:05:35] <enderx86> anyone know?
[21:06:37] <coldhead> enderx86: http://jsfiddle.net/tCmdX/
[21:06:55] <coldhead> that's the important difference between the two
[21:07:31] <coldhead> but i prefer the var f = function () {} form because it makes it clear that f is just a var, and you can assign a new function to it with f = function () {/*some other function*/}
[21:07:44] <coldhead> function f () looks like magic
[21:08:20] <enderx86> lol
[21:08:26] <a215> i just want to play fallout
[21:08:30] <enderx86> coldhead: you realize how confusing this is for a 10-year java programmer
[21:08:35] <coldhead> i think you should a215
[21:08:38] <a215> java sucks
[21:08:41] <a215> i hate it
[21:08:48] <enderx86> they must have created javascript because java needed an arch nemesis... like batman and the joker
[21:08:48] <coldhead> i sure do, enderx86. it will stretch your mind but it's worth it
[21:08:49] <nicholasschulz> When using .load to add content, why doesn't my already set jquery work on the loaded content?
[21:08:59] <a215> some programming languages... don't take this the wrong way but you can practically smell the people who designed them
[21:09:17] <a215> COBOL...Java...Go...
[21:09:36] <coldhead> at the risk of sounding incredibly old, i welcomed java when it came out as an alternative to c++
[21:09:50] <coldhead> of course i look stupid now but at the time it seemed like the promised land
[21:10:01] <coldhead> enderx86: is hoisiting any clear?
[21:10:35] <enderx86> Thank you coldhead. That was such a simple and concise explanation. The other site that explained it involved 5000 words of text and I thought, why read 5000 words of text when I can go on IRC?
[21:11:03] <coldhead> oh good
[21:11:20] <coldhead> the fuller explanation probably has subtle nuances no one ever needs to know
[21:11:32] <enderx86> exactly
[21:12:45] <a215> hey it worked
[21:14:37] <coldhead> great job a215 ! enjoy fallout
[21:14:44] <a215> i don't have it yet
[21:14:46] <a215> it's in the mail
[21:14:50] <nicholasschulz> When you use .load() to add content to a page, should already existing javascript code work on the loaded content??? cause right now it doesn'tâ€¦ any ideas?
[21:15:00] <coldhead> nicholasschulz: javascript is stripped out of .load()ed content
[21:15:10] <coldhead> to prevent running code multiple times
[21:15:38] <coldhead> you're "supposed" to move the JS to some global file and run functions from it as needed
[21:15:47] <coldhead> anyway i'm sorry
[21:16:01] <nicholasschulz> ok, but i load 3 buttons with a specified class,,,, on the already existing page there are some code telling the buttons to fade if clicked and have the specified classâ€¦.
[21:16:02] <nicholasschulz> ok
[21:16:08] <a215> oh now it's perfect
[21:16:08] <a215> sweet
[21:16:29] <coldhead> nicholasschulz: how did you bind the event handlers?
[21:16:39] <coldhead> if you delegate with on() it should work
[21:16:42] <coldhead> that's the Right Way
[21:17:55] <nicholasschulz> ok, thanks, ill try to add that and see if it works :-)
[21:18:13] <coldhead> good luck schulzy!
[21:19:41] <nicholasschulz> didn't work, so i might have to make a file global as you put it..
[21:20:58] <coldhead> want to show us how you tried nicholasschulz ?
[21:21:43] <nicholasschulz> its a shitty long code so idk if u wanna see :-p
[21:22:01] <nicholasschulz> redid the whole thing already, sorry. ill show u next time
[21:23:12] <coldhead> nicholasschulz: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZVSS/
[21:23:20] <coldhead> that's how on() can work nicely
[21:28:05] <abjorn> all i wanted was a pepsi, just one pepsi
[21:28:09] <abjorn> and she wouldn't give it to me, just one pepsi
[21:28:23] <coldhead> worst mother ever
[21:28:28] <coldhead> tell her i hate her
[21:28:50] <abjorn> I know right, then she puts me in a straight jacket
[21:28:52] <abjorn> INSTITUTION
[21:29:10] <nicholasschulz> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZVSS/1/
[21:29:35] <nicholasschulz> idk if jsfiddle allow you to load external content, but if you visit the link it shows the buttons i wanna load
[21:30:21] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZVSS/2/
[21:30:27] <coldhead> i just changed your click() to on()
[21:30:31] <coldhead> should work <3
[21:30:58] <gabrieluk> coldhead, i was thinking about our previous conversation, and i really think would be worthy to have a shoot in a custom plugin. That plugin we were debugging seems nice, but the true is that is over featured. I don't need js to set a wrapper, it just need to add a class. also, i don't need the extra options, such as topSpacing: 0, bottomSpacing: 0,. I was thinking about writting some pseudo code in order to do this in jquery. should be somet
[21:30:58] <gabrieluk> hing like this: when div "sticker" is about to hide, get div sticker and add class "sticked" and add position: fixed.in this case height would be always 100% within the id. what do you think?
[21:31:35] <coldhead> that could work gabrieluk
[21:31:39] <nicholasschulz> coldhead: â€¦ but it doesn't :-(
[21:31:43] <coldhead> you'll learn a bunch doing that
[21:32:02] <coldhead> nicholasschulz: it may be that the element i bound on() to is itself being replaced
[21:32:07] <coldhead> so you lose the binding
[21:32:14] <coldhead> you can fix that by binding like this
[21:32:30] <coldhead> $('body').on('click', '.btn_std', function () {...
[21:32:36] <coldhead> but don't tell anyone i told you that
[21:32:43] <coldhead> or they'll get mad
[21:32:47] * shoky notes
[21:32:54] <coldhead> GODDAMN IT SHOKY
[21:32:58] <shoky> HeeHaw
[21:33:17] <gabrieluk> coldhead, cool, i am willing to learn. i might try it
[21:33:30] <coldhead> #jQuery is happy to help gabrieluk!
[21:33:35] <coldhead> OR ELSE
[21:33:38] * coldhead glares at #jQuery
[21:33:41] <gabrieluk> the pseudo code is almost there, i think
[21:33:56] <gabrieluk> thanks
[21:33:58] <gabrieluk> :)
[21:36:13] <gabrieluk> if could be even a IF statment inside an anonymous function, such as if div sticker is hidden, add clas blabla, else nothing
[21:36:31] <coldhead> simplicity and elegance
[21:36:32] <nicholasschulz> coldhead: i think i found the flaw, however idk how to fix itâ€¦ look at the first line of the js,,, how do you get it to trigger on multiple elementsâ€¦. ?
[21:36:33] <nicholasschulz> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZVSS/3/
[21:36:56] <nicholasschulz> $("#quickBrowseMenu && #quickBrowseMenu_sub") â€¦. want it to trigger if any of the two are clicked
[21:37:07] <coldhead> just a comma
[21:37:23] <coldhead> $("#quickBrowseMenu, #quickBrowseMenu_sub")
[21:37:36] <coldhead> but if the _sub is a child of the #quickBrowseMenu
[21:37:39] <coldhead> you can leave it off
[21:37:44] <coldhead> just bind to the parent
[21:37:46] <nicholasschulz> OH MY LOOOORD ! It freakin' worked. thanks a lot!
[21:38:00] <nicholasschulz> its not a child
[21:38:05] <nicholasschulz> but now it works...!!!!!
[21:38:05] <coldhead> very good then
[21:38:21] <coldhead> and now you can feel like a boss because you're using current jQuery best practice
[21:38:31] <coldhead> check in in 6 months for the new best practice >: |
[21:39:20] <shoky> event delegation has been a best practice for a long time ;>
[21:39:45] <nicholasschulz> haha, ok
[21:39:59] <shoky> before ol' jquery was born
[21:40:07] <coldhead> before there were even events?
[21:40:10] <coldhead> it's in the bible?
[21:40:11] <coldhead> etc?
[21:40:15] <coldhead> dialtone?
[21:40:29] <shoky> i'll go research that
[21:41:57] <shoky> yes it seems god delegated creation to some dude named coldhead, and then time started
[21:42:24] <shoky> the fact that you're living in the future proves it
[21:42:55] <coldhead> works for me
[21:43:11] <coldhead> this is eerily like that intelligent design museum i went to
[21:43:14] <coldhead> esp. the coldhead wing
[21:44:29] <shoky> yes, ok
[21:44:35] <shoky> also, goodnight
[21:51:49] <Alpha64> hey guys i want to do this thing the right way, i'm tired of hacking stuff, here's what i have: http://pastebin.com/pLSGVKWJ can you put me into the right path?
[21:52:08] <dexec> Does anyone here use the jQuery Validation plugin?
[21:52:08] <Alpha64> it's basically making an accordion inside another accordion
[21:52:41] <Alpha64> like a master detail with accordions
[21:53:56] <beachandbytes> tough without an editable fiddle
[21:54:00] <beachandbytes> or jsbin
[21:55:38] <Alpha64> the problem is the ajax requests, can i do that with jsbin?
[21:59:50] <Alpha64> but the problem is that jquery ui needs the css
[21:59:54] <Alpha64> and the images
[22:00:12] <Alpha64> if i link them to my dropbox should it work?
[22:18:40] <gibyalex> Hi I am new Jquery
[22:18:59] <gibyalex> i  am stuck with Cross domain issue
[22:19:25] <Cork> Alpha64: ajax, iframes and fonts is the only things that's limited to the same domain
[22:20:03] <Cork> gibyalex: define issue
[22:20:07] <gibyalex> my requirement is that   i need to load external website in a div tag   in a html page
[22:20:36] <Cork> you have access to the remote server?
[22:20:44] <Cork> (so that you can change it's config that is)
[22:21:10] <gibyalex> i did get u Cork
[22:21:42] <gibyalex> can you please elaborate
[22:21:50] <Cork> gibyalex: in order to make ajax calls cross domains, the other end has to provide a specific http header naming your domain
[22:21:55] <Cork> else browsers will block the call
[22:22:26] <Cork> gibyalex: only other option is to proxy the call through your server
[22:23:34] <gibyalex> so  you mean that until ther other side allow access - jQuery.getJSON wont work it ?
[22:23:59] <Cork> .getJSON might work
[22:24:14] <Cork> if the other server serves jsonP
[22:24:20] <Cork> normal json won't ya
[22:24:56] <nicholasschulz> is it possible to change a element by using something else than class or id? i have a attribute called info
[22:25:20] <Cork> nicholasschulz:  $('elm[info]')
[22:25:28] <nicholasschulz> thanks cork
[22:25:32] <Alpha64> http://jsbin.com/uxafu3/17/ well i found someone using an accordion too in a jsbin so it's sorted out, the only problem is the ajax calls, i don't have a clue on how to fake them, but i think that this should be enough to see my problem
[22:25:33] <Cork> nicholasschulz: but you want to limit the parent as much as you can
[22:25:38] <Cork> nicholasschulz: cause that selector is slow
[22:25:45] <nicholasschulz> ok
[22:25:51] <Cork> nicholasschulz: btw "info" isn't a valid html attribute
[22:25:58] <Cork> you should name it "data-info"
[22:26:04] <nicholasschulz> ok thanks
[22:26:28] <Cork> (data- is a reserved prefix for all the attributes you want to add to any element)
[22:26:28] <gibyalex> hi Crok, can u please guide me how to use proxy the call inorder to get external  website
[22:27:12] <Cork> gibyalex: eh. its off topic for this channel, and theres many many ways to do it
[22:27:39] <Cork> gibyalex: it depends on what server language you want to use, or you can use nginx
[22:28:06] <Cork> gibyalex: if you want to do it thought php i suggest asking in ##php
[22:28:19] <Alpha64> you could use a php script that gathers that data for the client

[22:43:00] <gabrieluk> thanks, but i have to say, it is a tutorial i've done. i din't have to figure it out by myself. i cheated ^^
[22:43:28] <gabrieluk> but, i understand everything that is going on in there
[22:43:36] <gabrieluk> if that can save me

[22:45:34] <coldhead> it's not that important

[22:53:18] <Cork> man whats with all xss requests...
[22:53:25] <sosuke> i'm running into an issue with $().animate failing on iOS after scrolling, $().css() position still works
[22:54:25] <sosuke> has anyone used animate extensively on iOS?
[22:54:34] <Cork> brrc: ajax is async, so it haven't run when your rallking Showplaylist
[22:55:28] <Cork> brrc: if you want to work with the data from the ajax call, you need to do it or call it from inside the ajax callback
[22:56:56] <brrc> the xss vulns its just lack of care for now.
[22:57:05] <gabrieluk> coldhead, this is funny. i think is happening the same thing with the custom code as it was happening with the plugin, it kinda bumps. http://jsfiddle.net/UgPFQ/14/ what you think?
[22:58:11] <Cork> brrc: that comment was about all the requests for fetching ajax data from other domains
[22:58:19] <Cork> its been a big bunch today
[22:59:38] <brrc> from other domains ? what domains?
[22:59:55] <brrc> Cork: what domains, cam you explain better ?

[23:02:26] <coldhead> maybe i'll redo it

[23:11:30] <coldhead> on this day i lost faith
[23:11:49] <gabrieluk> well, i undertood all anyways, you just show and hide the spacer
[23:12:07] <gabrieluk> no need for the api ^^
[23:12:19] <gabrieluk> nooo, don't loose the faith!
[23:13:38] <coldhead> yeah there's not much to it
[23:13:52] <coldhead> i think the spacer is what the wrapper in the other plugin was for

[23:25:24] <nvartolomei> the sad thing is that every call to dest[funcName] calls wrong functions from src
[23:25:37] <nvartolomei> actually it calls the function which name was last in this loop
[23:25:48] <danheberden> nvartolomei: aye
[23:25:57] <nvartolomei> can i change this behavior?
[23:25:57] <danheberden> because you're assigning functions that use scoped params
[23:26:08] <danheberden> nvartolomei: yeah, use an iife in the loop
[23:26:08] <nvartolomei> so, how to do it right?
[23:26:37] <danheberden> like, (function(fn){ dest[funName]...})(src));
[23:26:47] <danheberden> or use something like jQuery's each
[23:26:55] <danheberden> which encapsulates the same behaviour
[23:27:04] <danheberden> but when you're using scoped variables in a loop
[23:27:11] <danheberden> each loop will overwrite that var
[23:27:31] <nvartolomei> got it
[23:31:42] <nvartolomei> trying to write beanstalkapp api wrapper for node.js
[23:31:42] <nvartolomei> thanks
[23:31:46] <nvartolomei> now it works
[23:31:49] <nvartolomei> as expected
[23:55:41] <chachan> guys, I'm getting syntax error. http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/JqJBY/2/
[23:55:55] <chachan> on line: min.attr('name').split('min')[1]: min.val()
[23:56:01] <chachan> I don't see the error
[23:56:19] <chachan> it says: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ("
[23:56:52] <chachan> any idea?
