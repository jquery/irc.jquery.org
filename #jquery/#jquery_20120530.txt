[00:21:33] <Nece228> how can i do that with jquery?
[00:21:45] <Nece228> perhaps with parseJSON?
[00:38:50] <klawd_prime> hi!

[00:41:13] <aismail_> I'm profiling a single page app
[00:41:20] <aismail_> and 30% of the time is being spent in jquery.cssHooks
[00:41:28] <aismail_> any ideas on how I can improve that?

[01:06:19] <rosieres> I´ve got the problem in ie7 to ie9 that ajax loaded content has an offset(); 0 0 ... in Chrome Safari and Firefox I get the right offset . . . what is that and how can I get rid of it ?
[01:09:07] <Nece228> can anyone review the code for errors?
[01:09:08] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/57882692
[01:09:20] <Nece228> it doesnt work, nothing happens
[01:13:43] <Whirl3d> nece228, really? You are not asking for html, you are asking for JSON. Using .html method with JSON will get you nothing
[01:14:04] <Nece228> result is same if i do append
[01:14:45] <Whirl3d> you have to append valid HTML as well
[01:15:01] <Whirl3d> you are getting an OBJECT literal back from a getJSON call
[01:18:21] <Nece228> Whirl3d: so ive redone
[01:18:22] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/64413916
[01:18:31] <Nece228> still doesnt work
[01:20:03] <Whirl3d> right before items, do a console.log(data)   if you don't get anything back, your getJSON is wrong
[01:20:21] <new> i am using jquery ajax for post. it is not success. Throwing error xhr.status 0 undefined.
[01:21:23] <Whirl3d> sorry to hear that new
[01:21:44] <iaj> Lo there... I got a task to solve, is there something wrong about that;         if $('div.required input').value == '') {
[01:21:50] <NodeX> perhaps a fiddle new ?
[01:21:56] <NodeX> ?fiddle @ new
[01:22:03] <bot-t> new, #10785 (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785
[01:22:16] <iaj> to check for all input fields below a div.required container if all are NON empty?
[01:22:19] <Nece228> Whirl3d: well i dont get anything in chrome console
[01:22:52] <Whirl3d> then your process.php is not returning valid JSON or anything, likely
[01:25:40] <Whirl3d> and why would you capture the form click like that? Do you have multiple forms on the page and whenever any form is clicked do the same thing?
[01:26:19] <rosieres> I´ve got the problem in ie7 to ie9 that ajax loaded content has an offset(); 0 0 ... in Chrome Safari and Firefox I get the right offset . . . what is that and how can I get rid of it ? -> Additional Note: If I call that page directly, the offset is also right. Only if loaded by ajax it´s not there . . .
[01:27:40] <Nece228> Whirl3d: well yes, every form has its value integer
[01:27:57] <Whirl3d> roseries, you have been in this channel long enought o know that a) Don't repeat your question like that...if someone knows, they'll help.  and B) make a fiddle or provide some code to look at.
[01:28:00] <Nece228> later in products.php i retrieve it with $form = $_POST['ordervalue']; and output
[01:28:02] <Nece228> json
[01:28:59] <Whirl3d> nece228, wtf is $("<'body/>',{....
[01:29:02] <rosieres> Whirl3d: sorry.... was just because of the additional note. I´ll fiddle it together . .
[01:29:07] <Whirl3d> then append to body
[01:29:18] <Whirl3d> that doesn't look like it's gonna make much sense
[01:29:41] <Whirl3d> and what is html:items? just use items
[01:30:32] <Whirl3d> and furthermore, why not just resltHTML="",     then instead of items.push   use resltHTML+=......
[01:30:52] <Whirl3d> then $("body").append(resltHTML);
[01:31:10] <Whirl3d> which will do nothing if nothing is returned from products.php
[01:31:45] <Whirl3d> can you call http://yourdomain/yourpath/products.php?ordervalue=3 and get something back.
[01:32:23] <Whirl3d> rosieres, np A fiddle will help a lot. Thanks.
[01:34:59] <iaj> Hey hmm.. can someone tell me what's wrong with that one, http://pastebin.com/eAruHUdT ?  Should check for all input fields to not be ''
[01:35:05] <Nece228> Whirl3d: now my brain is melting
[01:37:27] <Whirl3d> iaj, in your .each statement, don't use alert. Use console.log  first....second do something like :console.log(n, element)   that will give you an idea of home many items it's finding. Maybe not be any since I believe the selector you want is input:text not (input[type=text]);  though I am not sure
[01:38:26] <Whirl3d> and iaj, you might want to use .filter
[01:39:56] <Whirl3d> var blanks=$("input:text").filter(function (elem) { return $(elem).val().length/null:elem})
[01:41:05] <Whirl3d> that's weird...typo:   return $(elem).val().length?null:elem;
[01:44:18] <Trisox> mmm a bun with dried grapes
[01:47:50] <iaj> Whirl3d: thanks alot:) Will try... But one more question http://pastebin.com/EZdeCWLX < shouldnt the return false; stop the form from further submitting?
[01:48:19] <Whirl3d> no
[01:48:29] <Whirl3d> I don't think that works with the submit event
[01:48:32] <SuperPhly> I'm having a small issue with jQuery and the fading in of a page when it loads. It's working in Chrome, but not Firefox... $("body").fadeIn(250); ----- I have CSS set to body { display:none }
[01:48:32] <Whirl3d> only the click event
[01:48:48] <iaj> Whirl3d: can I stop the further submitting somehow?
[01:48:56] <Whirl3d> e.preventDefault()
[01:49:49] <Whirl3d> SuperPhly, are you executing yoru fade in on document ready?
[01:50:02] <SuperPhly> i am...
[01:50:15] <soee> hi, i have some popup and using fadeIn to how it, how can i make such popups show up if they are loaded (append to body) after some ajax call is made ?
[01:50:26] <SuperPhly> jQuery(document).ready(....
[01:50:57] <iaj> Whirl3d: ahhh tahnks man :)
[01:50:59] <Whirl3d> SuperPhly, just from my perspective, I never use the fade methods. I got burned a while back and learned to only use animate.
[01:51:36] <SuperPhly> Whirl3d: gotcha... do you think that could be the issue?
[01:51:46] <SuperPhly> just a difference between animate and fadeIn?
[01:51:56] <Whirl3d> SuperPhly, so you could do $("body").css({opacity:0, display:"none"}).animate({opacity:1}, 250);
[01:52:10] <Whirl3d> Honestly, I am not sure....
[01:52:33] <Trisox> i got torched :p
[01:52:34] <Whirl3d> look at your resultant CSS to determine if the display:none is being removed from your body element
[01:53:32] <SuperPhly> Whirl3d: still set...
[01:54:11] <Whirl3d> Sorry, display:"block" in the above example. duh!
[01:54:20] <davetarmac> Hi guys
[01:54:56] <Whirl3d> hi davetarmac
[01:55:14] <SuperPhly> in quotes... gotcha
[01:55:30] <davetarmac> I've been tasked with coming up with a nicer solution for notifying users about the EU cookie law blah blah, I've got a nice banner appearing, but I would like it to appear at the top of the site, pushing the page content down rather than just appearing over it. I've got this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/Qwn8p/
[01:56:21] <SuperPhly> Whirl3d: thanks man... i get it now. that was handy...
[01:56:34] <Whirl3d> right on
[01:56:43] <Whirl3d> davetarmac, sounds like a css thing
[01:57:13] <davetarmac> Whirl3d: yeah?
[01:57:15] <Whirl3d> change to position:relatie
[01:57:21] <Whirl3d> for #cookienotice
[01:57:45] <davetarmac> :s
[01:57:50] <davetarmac> I feel kinda dumb now
[01:57:59] <Whirl3d> and try a duration in your hide statement
[01:58:03] <Nece228> Whirl3d: ok so ive thinked of this idea. when i press on a form im gonna open url which is products.php?val.id (for instance products.php?3), ill then retrieve the url number and execute getJSON and will send that url number to server
[01:58:09] <Nece228> is it good solution?
[01:58:25] <Nece228> by good i mean secure, and professional
[01:58:55] <Whirl3d> how many products are we talking?
[01:59:27] <davetarmac> Thanks for the hints Whirl3d
[01:59:35] <Whirl3d> np davetarmac
[01:59:56] <Whirl3d> Nece228, here is the thing. Every call to the server takes time and messes with your presentation
[02:00:23] <Nece228> well thats what i need to do
[02:00:26] <Whirl3d> if possible load all of your product information first, store the relative product urls in the data object of their corresponding forms
[02:00:42] <Nece228> i dont need to load all the product information
[02:00:47] <Nece228> heres the thing
[02:01:26] <Bubbi> Anybody here used jQuery Mobile? I am having some trouble using .on() with it..  $('.containerSelector').on('click', 'input:radio'', function(){ ... }) doesn't work. It applies the event correctly, but it is as if the event won't be called.. I can perfectly use $('.containerSelector input:radio').bind('click', ...), but I would very much like to use event delegation, as the radiobuttons are replaced via Ajax
[02:01:58] <Nece228> those forms are actually shopping cart orders .that val.id is actually the id of the order, when i will send that id number to the server ill receive all products which are in that order
[02:02:37] <krz> I've got 3 json objects: [ Object { _id="foo" }, Object { _id="bar" }, Object { _id="foobar" } ] how can i check if "foobar" is in one of the _id's?
[02:02:54] <Whirl3d> then you query products.php?3 and get a url returned as text
[02:03:19] <Nece228> so if i click on order called food which has id 1, then im gonna open url products.php?1 and then im gonna retrieve the number 1, and request getJSON and send this number to the server, server will give me all of the products which have that order id
[02:03:54] <Whirl3d> see, I'm not getting you
[02:04:09] <Nece228> yeah its hard to explain
[02:04:14] <Whirl3d> what do you mean, I open url products.php?1 and retrieve the number 1
[02:04:29] <Nece228> i mean i retrieve the number 1 which is in url
[02:04:42] <Whirl3d> from products.php?
[02:04:50] <Nece228> yeah from address bar
[02:05:06] <krz> anyone?
[02:05:24] <Whirl3d> krz, gimme a minute
[02:05:35] <krz> is there a better way than going through an each loop?
[02:05:41] <krz> Whirl3d: sure thing
[02:06:08] <Whirl3d> but Nece228, you open url products.php in an iframe or something?
[02:06:51] <Nece228> Whirl3d: no i open products.php in browser
[02:07:05] <Nece228> i open it as a seperate page
[02:07:46] <Whirl3d> then in the new separate page in the browser, you have doc ready that looks at the location?
[02:08:01] <Nece228> yes
[02:08:14] <Nece228> something like window.location.pathname
[02:08:32] <Whirl3d> Okay, for future information, I was just confused about the first part which doesn't matter in any way
[02:08:59] <Nece228> i actually dont want to do ajax request in same page
[02:09:02] <Whirl3d> so, you have page that has ?3 in the url, and you want to get the product informaiton using that as a reference
[02:09:05] <Nece228> thats why i want to open seperate url
[02:09:16] <Nece228> yes
[02:09:26] <davetarmac> Whirl3d: is thre a way to make it slide up, rather than the default slide to the left?
[02:09:34] <davetarmac> I've updated the fiddle above
[02:09:44] <Whirl3d> so, make sure that your products.php contains the docready script and you should be good
[02:09:49] <Whirl3d> davetarmac, gimme a minute
[02:09:57] <davetarmac> no worries
[02:10:13] <Nece228> you mean $(document).ready?
[02:10:20] <Whirl3d> krz, you could try object[foobar]===undefined?
[02:10:46] <Whirl3d> sorry, object["foobar"]===undefined
[02:11:12] <Whirl3d> object["id"]{"foobar"]===undefined?
[02:11:13] <Bubbi> I can't get  .on() to work with jQuery Mobile. Somebody know anything about how to make it work..? I have tried the following: $('.containerSelector').on('click', 'input:radio'', function(){ ... }). It applies the event correctly, but the event itself won't fire. I can perfectly use $('.containerSelector input:radio').bind('click', ...), but I would very much like to use event delegation, as the radiobuttons are replaced via Ajax
[02:11:43] <Whirl3d> Bubbl, thats the most likely way to get me, for one to ignore you. Not that I am the best help, but really.
[02:11:44] <krz> Whirl3d: ???
[02:11:56] <Whirl3d> I am not sure how your object is built
[02:12:05] <krz> i just gave it to you
[02:12:18] <krz> i don't think you understand the issue at all
[02:12:38] <Whirl3d> I dont' think that {id=400} is a valid object declaration, is it?
[02:13:05] <Whirl3d> {id:400} maybe
[02:13:24] <krz> thats how firebug is retiring it as
[02:13:36] <Bubbi> Whirl3d: why would it get you to ignore me? I rephrased my question, as it might help better understanding..?
[02:13:59] <Whirl3d> so you could use .map or .filter, but that's bascally .each
[02:14:02] <Whirl3d> or looping
[02:14:16] <krz> so a loop is required
[02:14:28] <Whirl3d> actually, I think they found that looping like Var c=objectlist.length; while (c--) {do stuff) is the fastest
[02:14:31] <krz> not i have to check each _id in each object
[02:14:44] <krz> id rather use each, if thats the case
[02:15:08] <krz> not=note
[02:15:09] <Whirl3d> you might want to use .map or .filter....they might be more in tune with what you want.
[02:15:19] <krz> thanks. will check up on this
[02:16:25] <Whirl3d> davetamac, sorry for the dealy. You could manually hide the element using .animate().   so you would do something like $("container").animate({height:0, opacity:0}, 4000, function () {$(this).hide();});
[02:16:39] <Whirl3d> or better yet $(this).remove();
[02:16:50] <Whirl3d> get rid of it if you aren't gonna show it again
[02:17:02] <new> i am have a main site with credentials. i want to acess another one web application within a ifame in the main site with same credentials .When on click log in main site i wrote javascript to submit to other site also. But main site  navigates when log in. So other site is not logged in. how to do this in jquery
[02:17:57] <Whirl3d> Bubbl, please go to jsfiddle.net and setup an example fo the problem you are having. Otherwise, I would check the jquery mobile site bug trackers to see if anyone else has ha dthe same problem
[02:18:48] <Whirl3d> new, I know nothing about iframes and though I wish I could help, I have no idea. Good luck
[02:20:50] <Whirl3d> Bubbl, perhaps something is preventing the click from being applied to the element because it's returning false. Maybe you could use the "change" event
[02:22:01] <Bambus> hey all
[02:22:31] <Bambus> i have Image1= new Image(1589,660) and Image1.src = "src/bg-body.png"          now how i can do when this image is load then do next.. ?
[02:23:14] <Bubbi> Whirl3d: I'll have a go at it, thanks :-)
[02:23:16] <Whirl3d> before you apply the source, use jquery to wrap the image element then use the jquery .load (successhandler) method to fire loadnext
[02:23:21] <Whirl3d> Bubbl, np
[02:23:34] <Whirl3d> bubbl, let us know what you find out
[02:24:24] <new> when asked the same in javascript a week ago , they adviced me to do with jquery ajax. on sucess of first submit to another site , i can do the submit to main site. but when i wrote jquery ajax for post success was not called and it was an error. i am fresher  to jquery. When i asked a few time back i got reply as fiddle. i didn't understand
[02:24:46] <Whirl3d> Bambus, try this: var image1=new Image();var img=$(image1); img.load(function () {//format image1; loadNext()}).attr("src", url);
[02:25:00] <Whirl3d> Bambus, but then you have to follow that immediately with:
[02:25:21] <Whirl3d> if (image1.complete) {img.load();}
[02:25:31] <Whirl3d> to accommodate an IE error with cached images
[02:26:08] <Whirl3d> new, do you have the url for that fiddle
[02:26:25] <new> no
[02:26:35] <Whirl3d> Look in your browser cache
[02:26:39] <Whirl3d> history
[02:27:39] <new> is it like pastebin ?
[02:27:50] <Whirl3d> what?
[02:28:11] <new> i mean fiddle. should i paste my code there?
[02:28:30] <Whirl3d> yes. It's like pastebin on steroids, with a pulse
[02:28:50] <Whirl3d> and some class
[02:29:22] <Whirl3d> wearing just the tops of a turquoise bikini...hot
[02:29:44] <Bambus> Whirl3d i can,t understand it. ... like this or how ? :/ http://pastebin.com/GSsfwhy1
[02:30:23] <Whirl3d> Bambus, fyi, I hate pastebin. jsfiddle is so much better. I'll look, but if it's a pain in the ass, try a fiddle. LOL
[02:30:39] <Nece228> i can retrieve sent .getJSON variable with $_GET or $_POST?
[02:31:01] <new> should i paste my code in http://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[02:31:10] <Whirl3d> Bambus, the problem is that as soon as you apply the src attribute, the image starts loading
[02:31:51] <Whirl3d> so, it's possible that your load event fires before yout can handle it using $(image1).load
[02:32:19] <Whirl3d> so you want to first, create the image element:  var image1=new Image();
[02:32:34] <Whirl3d> then you want to wrap it in jquery goodness: var img=$(image1);
[02:33:09] <john-dev> hey
[02:33:09] <Whirl3d> now that you can use jquery method on it, handle the load event using load:  img.load(///do stuff)
[02:33:29] <john-dev> how can i check if a div with overflow:hidden does hide a long text or not?
[02:33:40] <Whirl3d> and then after handling the load event apply the src attribute: img.load(//doStuff).attr(src',url);
[02:33:43] <Bambus> whirl3d and why this not works ?_ http://jsfiddle.net/Gzd77/1/
[02:34:03] <Whirl3d> Did you read what I posted already?
[02:34:23] <Whirl3d> your image loads before the handler is assigned
[02:35:04] <Whirl3d> plus you are using $(image) not $(Image1)
[02:35:16] <Whirl3d> I vs i
[02:35:44] <Whirl3d> john-dev, you are going to have to look for the scrol-height value of the div
[02:36:12] <john-dev> hm, nice idea
[02:36:45] <Whirl3d> Bambus: http://jsfiddle.net/Gzd77/3/
[02:36:57] <john-dev> like if scroll-height > 0.. ?
[02:37:31] <Whirl3d> john-dev, I 'am not sure how scroll-height works. It might be that scroll-height-element.height>0   I dunno for sure
[02:38:17] <Whirl3d> in other words, the scrollheight attribute might be 0 or it might be the element height if its not overflowing...you'd have to look that up
[02:39:17] <Whirl3d> Nece228, it's important you understand that JSON is just text.
[02:39:27] <Whirl3d> that happens to be in "object notation"
[02:40:16] <Whirl3d> so you can get the JSON text using whatever method you want, then you have to parse it in to a JSON object if your want....or you can use .getJSON if you know it's going to be JSON object string returned
[02:42:50] <Whirl3d> new, did you get your code posted to jsfiddle
[02:44:16] <new> please give me few minutes. i will do it now
[02:44:26] <Nece228> Whirl3d: thanks for information
[02:44:35] <Whirl3d> not rushing you. I didn't want you to think that I had forgotten ya
[02:44:41] <Nece228> well its gonna be just json output
[02:45:11] <Bambus> whirl3d thx working :) btw is it hard to make % when a img is load ? or someting easy that the page is not just empty you know :/
[02:45:34] <Whirl3d> I would use a loading gif, honestly
[02:45:47] <Whirl3d> not the ideal% but at least an animated image in it's place
[02:46:07] <Whirl3d> Also, don't forget to append the image to the dom in your //do stuff
[02:47:04] <Whirl3d> people will do this a lot: var temp=$(new Image()).attr("src','loadingur.gif').appendTo('container') for example
[02:47:36] <Whirl3d> than in the load handler, they will say $("container img").repalceWith(img);
[02:47:53] <new> http://jsfiddle.net/fyWs5/
[02:48:28] <Whirl3d> new, now paste the HTML and the CSS into their corresponding windows and click update
[02:49:13] <Bambus> Whir3d how i can $(Image2)    make more images $(Image2, Image1) will not work
[02:49:34] <Whirl3d> Bambus, gimme just a minute and I will write it all up in one fiddle for you.
[02:50:24] <new> it is plone site. i am using jquery inside plone.
[02:51:43] <Bambus> Whirl3d thanks alot bro :)
[02:55:20] <Whirl3d> Bambus, http://jsfiddle.net/Gzd77/4/
[02:55:36] <Whirl3d> I may not have the implementation perfect, but you should be able to see what I was doing from there
[02:56:08] <Whirl3d> of course, I left out the first loadNext(); but you get the idea
[03:00:33] <Bambus> Whirl3d why we doing var loadingGIF=$("html"); ??? i just want to preload images i dont want to place them they are allready in css defined i just want to load it to the cache and then i will do my fade ins ..
[03:00:34] <rosieres_respawn> whirl3d: perhaps you remember .... but I can´t get it working in my the fiddle because is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.  And I have no clue how to reproduce there . . .  and the develPlatform is only accessible by vpn
[03:01:17] <Whirl3d> You asked about having a loader ...that's one way to do it. If you don't want a loader image, don't use it
[03:01:26] <Koesper> New to the IRC channel, but quick question. Where/how (and should) I submit suggestions for the documentation?
[03:02:02] <Koesper> The example on http://api.jquery.com/event.delegateTarget/  is missing the demo
[03:02:08] <Whirl3d> did you check the documentation pages?
[03:02:21] <Whirl3d> they are working on the documentation right now
[03:02:26] <MBehtemam> how to convert keyCode or charcode to unicode ?
[03:02:47] <Whirl3d> they will be releasing an entirely new documentation site soon.
[03:03:00] <new> i have pasted html. http://jsfiddle.net/fyWs5/1/
[03:03:04] <Koesper> Thx Whirl3d
[03:03:12] <Whirl3d> np
[03:03:40] <Whirl3d> you can review the new docs, but I don't the url handy.  Check git for jquery 1.8 docus
[03:03:56] <Bambus> Whirl3d how i can edit your function that i it will be only downloaded to cache and then stop i dont want to place it in a # div or etc.
[03:04:08] <Serge__> hi, can anybody tell me if there is a possibility to know what <td> was clicked in tr.click() event in jquery?
[03:04:15] <Whirl3d> so, you don't append it
[03:04:19] <Whirl3d> remove the append
[03:04:25] <Koesper> Doh! indeed, should have checked github...
[03:04:32] <Whirl3d> or the replacewith in this example
[03:05:03] <Whirl3d> Serge, if you bind the click event to the row using .on you can
[03:05:12] * Koesper saw a big shiney link to IRC, and thought, wow! havent been on IRC in ages!
[03:05:23] <new> i have pasted html and updated.is my jquery code correct?  http://jsfiddle.net/fyWs5/1/
[03:05:25] <Serge__> Whirl3d, thanks, will read for it now
[03:05:44] <Whirl3d> $("tr").on("click", "td", function (e) {  $(this) is the td in question)
[03:05:53] <Bambus> Whirl3d ah i dont know its not working when i removed the append .
[03:06:13] <MBehtemam> how to convert keyCode or charcode to unicode ?
[03:06:16] <Whirl3d> put a console.log in the success/error handler to let you know
[03:06:47] <Whirl3d> MBehtemam, rather than spam up the channel with repeating your question, perhaps you could use google while your turn is coming up?
[03:07:22] <Bambus> whirl3d console.log ?
[03:08:28] <Whirl3d> ooooh, bad Bambus...
[03:08:42] <Whirl3d> you need to have the developer console in whatever browser you are using
[03:09:09] <Whirl3d> In Chrome it's devtools, every browser has it...then you can see what is happening behind the scenes
[03:09:26] <Whirl3d> and anything you put in console.log() gets typed out in the
[03:09:27] <Whirl3d> log
[03:10:01] <Bambus> whirl3d :D:D k so i put console.log( ) in the function at bottom k ?
[03:10:07] <Chris_CC> Hi guys ... brand new to jquery, can someone point a good place to learn , assuming little/no knowledge of javascript (i have php/mysql/html is all) ultimately i want to creat a <select> drop down list within a form based of another ones value .
[03:10:18] <Whirl3d> so, new, you are having problems with the fact that it automatically submites the form?
[03:10:47] <new> yes
[03:10:51] <Whirl3d> you need to handle the submit event $("form").submit(function (e) {e.preventDefault(); /do stuff});
[03:11:44] <Whirl3d> Bambus, put it where you want it: in the loadSuccess function....that way it logs whenever successfully loading an image
[03:12:18] <Whirl3d> and put another in the load error, for example, that say console.log("OH SHooT Error!"); and you can see the errors
[03:13:16] <new> thank u . is using ajax wrong for form submission.in $("form") can i get a calback on success so that on success i can do another submit?
[03:13:53] <Whirl3d> new, every time the submit button is clicked, the submit handler will run
[03:15:16] <new> and i have used ajax within that so that too should get executed . it is executing that error function
[03:15:19] <Whirl3d> rosieres_respawn, paste the link to the fiddle here and we can look at it regardless of whether it fails.
[03:15:36] <Bambus> Whirl3d there was a syntax error at bottom but now when i do alert it dont do nothing how i can check if its working ....
[03:15:59] <Whirl3d> did you update the fiddle?
[03:16:27] <rosieres_respawn> Whirl3d: have anwer the phone atm. brb
[03:16:34] <Whirl3d> np
[03:16:41] <Bambus> http://jsfiddle.net/Gzd77/9/
[03:17:22] <Whirl3d> you are missing at least half of it
[03:17:39] <Whirl3d> like the entire load handler assignment
[03:18:24] <Bambus> you mean this ? loadingGIF.replaceWith(img);
[03:19:29] <Bambus> whirl3d can,t you update it that it will only load img1src, img 2 src img 3 src to the cache and thats all after that i can make my other fades.
[03:20:07] <Bambus> whirl3d i dont want to place them in a div ... cuz when some ppl has by mistake off javascript they will nothing see...
[03:21:40] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Gzd77/12/
[03:22:32] <Whirl3d> Bambus, the key to this code is the part where you say img.load(loadSuccess).error(loadError).attr('src', imageURL);
[03:22:51] <Whirl3d> that actually sets up the load handlers and applies the source to start the image loading
[03:22:55] <Whirl3d> you were missing that.
[03:23:15] <Whirl3d> then you had the loadNext() commmand inside itself
[03:23:30] <Whirl3d> so it would never get fired
[03:24:53] <stenno|work> good day, i am using the jQuery.validate plugin. i closely followed the demo example found here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation. now, my question is, how can i make the string "This field is required." display next to the invalid input? the relevant markup looks like <em>*</em><input name="projectname" type="text" class="input-medium required" placeholder="Name" />. If i submit the
[03:24:53] <stenno|work> form, the invalid field gets focused as expected, but said string is not displayed
[03:25:03] <Bambus> whirl3d im so low in this jquery im really out now .. :/ so i need just put that code img.load(loadSuccess).error(loadError).attr('src', imageURL); in the function and then i can write up the img src and it will only download it to the cache or how :(
[03:25:18] <soee> any idea why this doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/chTpTpLw ?
[03:25:34] <Whirl3d> Bambus, put your image urls in the "imageList" and it should work
[03:25:55] <Whirl3d> but if you want to display them, you will ahve to append them to the dom before they can be see
[03:26:12] <soee> basicly i want to show some divs appended to body after ajax call is fisnished
[03:26:20] <Koesper> soee: i wasn't aware that "toggle" was a valid value?
[03:26:44] <Bambus> whirl3d i just need to download them in the cache... and when all imgs are downloaded then i start show the body and all will fade.. .etc
[03:26:51] <soee> Koesper, it is i think, on other elements that are not loaded hrough ajax its working
[03:27:52] <stenno|work> ooh never mind. The View Source tag does not actually show the correct source of the example
[03:27:54] <Koesper> soee: havent used that myself, but i'll take your word. I'd use a simple .fadeIn('slow') instead of the animate({â€¦..})
[03:27:59] <Whirl3d> the cache isn't part of thedom
[03:28:04] <Whirl3d> so they won't be see
[03:28:20] <stenno|work> wait no
[03:28:37] <soee> Koesper, animation doeant matter atm, simple alert soesnt work so event isn't called at all
[03:28:52] <Koesper> ah, ok.
[03:28:56] <stenno|work> wait no
[03:30:04] <Whirl3d> Koesper, I prefer never to use fadeIn or out shortcuts, btw. They have had errors in the past and I am unsure if those errors were ever fixed. It's best to use animate, imo, and toggle is supposedly a valid value..still I don't use that shortcut either.
[03:30:32] <Bambus> Whirl3d can you please last time update your function for me that it will works like this : all the images that will be in src will load to the cache and after all images are loaded i will can write my allready finished codes that will show the images slow and fadein ... etc
[03:30:54] <stenno|work> eeh short question, .live is deprecated in newer jquery, right? so i have to use .on ?
[03:30:57] <Bambus> Whirl3d i please you really ...:/
[03:31:27] <Whirl3d> Bambus, do you understand that loading the images into the cache does not make them visible no matter how hard you try unless you add them to the dom
[03:32:20] <rosieres_respawn> Whirl3D: http://jsfiddle.net/EGJVM/1/
[03:32:41] <Whirl3d> once they are part of the dom, visible or not, you can fade them, manipulate them, whatver. But caching the images is not the same thing
[03:32:53] <Bambus> Whirl3d okey but when they loaded to cache and when they finish and then i start to load them by <div> fadein , fadeout they will load fast cuz i loaded them first to the cache ...
[03:33:32] <Whirl3d> so you have code that adds div's with images in them, right?
[03:34:57] <Whirl3d> paste all of this code in the head of your document inside <script> tags after loading jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/Gzd77/13/
[03:35:14] <Whirl3d> replace the urls for the placeKitten with the urls of your images
[03:35:31] <Bambus> whirl3d sec  i paste all http://jsfiddle.net/rp9uH/
[03:37:16] <Whirl3d> wow, Bambus, I feel like I am beating my head against the wall. I tell you exactly what you need and write the code for you and your example that you provide back doesn't contain any of the latest info.
[03:37:36] <Whirl3d> html may not have the fade in method. I'm not sure
[03:37:38] <Bambus> whirl3d yes i have divs and they got background images .. so i want to load them all first in cache witrh .hide the page and when its loaded i will start the fade ins to have a nice effect at start then i set cookie to false cuz all images are in the cache so theere will be no problems anymore. with slow loading.
[03:37:45] <Whirl3d> and I can't see your html
[03:38:03] <Whirl3d> paste the HTML in the html section and the CSS in the CSS section
[03:39:38] <Whirl3d> and just because you change the cookie value doesn't mean anything else is going to happen. You check the cookie value on document ready...so you would have to "reload the page to recehck the cookie value
[03:39:45] <Whirl3d> I would do this:
[03:40:03] <Whirl3d> in your CSS for "body", set display:"none", opacity:0;
[03:40:44] <Whirl3d> then bind the load event to all of your image elements ...
[03:41:31] <Whirl3d> then as each image is done loading or errored loading, increase the count of "totalImages" until it reaches the number of image containers.
[03:41:48] <Bambus> whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/rp9uH/1/
[03:49:42] <soee> what would be the best way to append few divs to body and (if they are posisioned absolute) show one after another ?>
[03:50:42] <new> can't ajax()  used form submitting form ?
[03:51:11] <new> can't ajax()  used for submitting form without getting input from user
[03:55:51] <Whirl3d> Bambus, try something along these lines: http://jsfiddle.net/rp9uH/9/
[03:59:16] <new> i missed closing braces. i have updated now .http://jsfiddle.net/fyWs5/2/.  i am getting completed message. and not sucess instead error function is called
[04:00:49] <Whirl3d> Bambus, one minute, there's an even easier solution
[04:01:09] <fable> hey, everyone; have you noticed an issue with .children() where .children('td') would return all cells, but .children('td[editable]') returns an empty collection (provided my markup is like: <td editable></td>
[04:01:21] <fable> surprisingly, .find('td[editable]') works fine
[04:01:38] <Bambus> Whir13d thx for still helping me :/ god bless you.
[04:01:48] <fable> is that a bug or an undocumented feature, or maybe I'm missing something?
[04:07:39] <sanjayb> fable: interesting.
[04:09:03] <fable> it seems when the attribute is editable="true" it works just fine
[04:10:24] <fable> never mind though, it seems it's something on my end, not an issue with jquery - the jsfiddle works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/wXze3/
[04:11:00] <Bambus> whir13d here ?
[04:11:01] <rosieres_respawn> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/EGJVM/1/ -> wrote your nick false on last post
[04:15:35] <BeakZ> Hey all, have a query about pushing and popping a jQuery version into the DOM.  Have 1.4.4 loaded, then load 1.7.2, then use "var jQuery_1_7_2 = $.noConflict(true)" to pop the last jQuery into a var.  Now need to "wrap" some JScript that can't be modified to use jQuery_1_7_2 instead of $, so can POP the 1.4.4 jQuery, but how can you then PUSH the 1.7.2 into the DOM?
[04:18:32] <ravenzz> BeakZ uuuuat
[04:18:54] <ravenzz> why do you need 2 versions of jquery?
[04:20:41] <BeakZ> In our CMS, all sites will use a tip version of jQuery, but if a designer wants to use a jQuery library that is say a newer version, but we haven't regression tested it across all other libraries on a page, then we'd like to use the noConflict() method to let them run specific code inside a "bubble" without affecting any other libraries on the page
[04:20:53] <BeakZ> Can POP ok, just can't PUSH :)
[04:22:53] <Haprog> once you POP.. :P
[04:23:04] <BeakZ> I just can't stop! lol
[04:23:35] <ravenzz> mh
[04:30:36] <nFFF> Guys, Im stumped
[04:30:55] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/VQ57z/ why isn't $(this).closest('label') returning 0 elements?
[04:31:43] <Cork> nFFF: cause input doesn't have label as a parent
[04:32:11] <Cork> you need $(this).closest('.input-box').prev()
[04:32:26] <Cork> or $(this).closest('.input-box').prevAll('label').first()
[04:33:58] <ravenzz> BeakZ http://jsfiddle.net/etXVu/
[04:34:14] <ravenzz> this can be a solution
[04:34:15] <tdskate> Hi,  I'm trying to make a time stamp like this "hh:mm" but if it's 1hour and 1 minute, I get this:   1:1, I want it to be 01:01, how do I do that?
[04:35:26] <shoky> one way would be to add a zero if it's less than 10...
[04:35:42] <Cork> tdskate: you would have to build a function to prefix it with zeros
[04:35:56] <Cork> or you could use on of the format libs
[04:36:02] <Cork> on==one
[04:41:01] <nFFF> Cork
[04:41:02] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/VQ57z/1/
[04:41:17] <nFFF> Any reason why $(this).prevAll('label').first(); is returning null for First name box
[04:41:27] <Cork> yes
[04:41:36] <Cork> label isn't a sibling to the input
[04:42:50] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/VQ57z/3/
[04:42:52] <nFFF> What is it then>
[04:42:56] <nFFF> Looks like a sibling to me
[04:45:47] <nFFF> Fuck its the ternary
[04:46:05] <nFFF> gotta add .length
[04:46:58] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[04:47:24] <ravenzz> because I feel that there could be a better solution
[04:47:35] <ravenzz> are you trying to select the input's label?
[04:48:04] <nFFF> Just some script to blur/remove labels on focus, keydown
[04:48:18] <nFFF> Except the markup isn't uniform
[04:48:30] <nFFF> Depending on the form element, it can be wrapped differently
[04:48:35] <nFFF> But I have it now its fine
[04:48:39] <BeakZ> ravenzz: Thanks, I'll have a look.
[04:48:51] <ravenzz> man the for is actually an "anchor" to the input field
[04:49:06] <ravenzz> id==for
[04:49:44] <Bambus> how i can set the background color black ?
[04:49:52] <ravenzz> $('label[for=" + $(this).attr("id") + "]')
[04:50:04] <Bambus> im hidding all $('html, #main-logo, #login-box, #big-banner').hide();         and i need set background-color black
[04:50:08] <nFFF> you talking to me ? :?
[04:50:13] <ravenzz> yes?
[04:50:57] <juha_> Bambus: $("elem").css("backgroundColor":"black");
[04:51:21] <juha_> Bambus: ugh not : but ,
[04:51:46] <ravenzz> missing colons

[04:52:53] <ravenzz> indeed

[04:53:20] <nFFF> Much more elegant :) thanks
[04:53:48] * MrSaints is away: What light does yonder window break?
[04:53:51] <ravenzz> also don't you get annoyed of jQuery ? it is so long to write
[04:54:41] <nFFF> I do, but its 10 lines of code that Im editing, and im just in and out of this page/site
[04:54:46] <Bambus> juha_ thx but i dont know how to make a black background at beggining and then how to fade it that it will be removed.
[04:54:55] <nFFF> IT's a magento site, you stay here long, bad things happen :D
[04:55:10] <ravenzz> nFFF anyway you should "cache"  $(this)
[04:55:24] <ravenzz> and any other thing that you use more than one time
[04:55:32] <juha_> Bambus: if my memory serves me, you need jquery ui for background color animations
[04:55:34] <Bambus> juha_ u see im trying to make a nice effect http://jsfiddle.net/JuSCY/
[04:55:53] <ravenzz> var elem = $(this); elem.whatever(); elem.whattafak()
[04:56:34] <Bambus> juha_ im first hide all elements then i load images and then i want to fade in all elements that its a nice effect but i want to do that the background color will be black and fade in to transparent .. and then my page divs will fade in .. you know understand me? :/
[04:56:40] <ravenzz> so you won't the selector engine hundred times
[04:57:44] <juha_> Bambus: check jquery animate for background color animations, but remember that you can't animate to transparent
[04:58:20] <stenno> why not?
[04:58:21] <ravenzz> today I'll win the typo fail compilation
[04:58:34] <ravenzz> again, competition*
[04:58:48] * stenno pats ravenzz

[04:58:57] <ravenzz> :d
[04:59:08] <stenno> its not even friday!!
[05:00:13] <Bambus> juha_ look someting like this black bg color at start and it fade to remove the black http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/queryLoader/
[05:01:00] * MrSaints is back (gone 00:07:12)
[05:13:20] <Bambus> juha_ here?
[05:14:56] <juha_> yeah, what you should do instead of trying to fadein body is to add another div on top of the page and when everything is ready, fadeout that div to show content under that div

[05:17:33] <terryleigh> I've loaded html into a variable using the ajax method.. I need to make each 'name' for the input unique before I append to the form in the main html.. what is the best way of doing that?
[05:21:58] <Bambus> how i can fadein a background-img to my html ? $('html').load(Image2, function() {
[05:24:00] <NodeX> ?shart
[05:24:56] <terryleigh> this is what I had in mind.. http://jsfiddle.net/TFaq5/1/ but how do I make each row's input have a unique name?
[05:25:50] <rosieres_respawn> can I check with jquery if a swf is completely loaded ?
[05:26:39] <shoky> unlikely
[05:27:21] <rosieres_respawn> doesn´t sound good ;-)
[05:28:27] <terryleigh> anyone? I just need to know how to modify HTMl loaded with ajax before I append it.
[05:28:28] <shoky> terryleigh:  you can load the html into a jquery object:  $( $row )
[05:28:37] <terryleigh> ah...
[05:28:45] <shoky> terryleigh: and then run queries on it like any jq obj
[05:28:55] <terryleigh> thanks shoky
[05:31:07] <stenno> gah i feel stupid to be confused by such a simple problem, but: i want to express with jquery: "If now or in the future there is an element with a class .myclass, i want to append a, say, <br /> to it"
[05:31:28] <stenno> how can i do that? i read the .on
[05:31:35] <shoky> it's not a trivial thing
[05:31:38] <stenno> but i got confused by it, too :)
[05:31:49] <stenno> ah
[05:31:52] <shoky> but.. just add the <br> when adding those elements?
[05:32:15] <stenno> let me explain
[05:32:35] <Bambus> how to fadein a background-img setted in html ?
[05:34:36] <stenno> i use the jquery validate plugin, and in the demo example, i see after a failed validation there a nice text "This element is required" or something. i typed the example word by word, but still the text doesn't show up. i saw, however, that the class validation-error gets added. so i wanted to simply workaround by expressing with jquery "if an element has the class .validation-error, i want to
[05:34:36] <stenno> append said text" (i just used <br /> because it was shorter ^^")
[05:35:15] <iQuestion> Hello
[05:36:04] <stenno> i followed closely the demo here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[05:36:32] <shoky> stenno: there's no reliable way to do that unless you control when it's added, or you somehow know when its added..
[05:36:48] <stenno> argh
[05:37:00] <Bambus> why i can,t fade in and image ? look please -- > http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/
[05:37:04] <iQuestion> i have to calculate the value of radio buttons together inside a div with id kanaler but it doesn't seem to work when i set it to that specific div id
[05:37:29] <stenno> shoky, i thought that jquery .on would have helped me there
[05:37:32] <stenno> grr then still
[05:37:40] <stenno> why does the example show the text
[05:37:51] <stenno> but when i clone it, it doesn't show it
[05:38:02] <NET||abuse> hi guys, i'm using jquery ui slider, trying to do a range slider (single handle) and the problem i have is the handle goes right off to the left
[05:38:05] <NET||abuse> http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/4448/selection011.png
[05:38:11] <stenno> maybe that should be the place to look
[05:38:21] <shoky> stenno: it would help , if there was an event to listen for :P
[05:38:36] <NET||abuse> here it is when it's slid up a little bit  http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/3780/selection012i.png
[05:39:10] <NET||abuse> I can't figure out how to stop the slider handle from going off to the left beyond the limits of the containing area
[05:39:18] <NET||abuse> and overshooting the background image by so much
[05:39:23] <stenno> shoky, RIGHT, THERE SHOULD BE!
[05:39:28] <stenno> argh sorry for capslock
[05:40:00] <shoky> stenno: there are events when DOM stuff is added but nothing reliable/cross-browser currently
[05:40:16] <g0bl1n> what's the simplest way (no plugins) to draw a small rectangle in an image element ?
[05:40:32] <stenno> shoky, no i mean, the validation plugin triggering events on (failed) validateionj
[05:40:35] <NET||abuse> g0bl1n: canvas
[05:40:36] <stenno> validations*
[05:40:48] <stenno> also svg
[05:40:49] <shoky> stenno: oh.. maybe there is. i donno that plugin
[05:41:15] <NET||abuse> stenno: i've did an svg project last year, It's EVIL
[05:41:43] <NET||abuse> svg is so cross browser messy that it's just not worth it
[05:41:44] <stenno> ugh ouch
[05:41:45] <g0bl1n> NET||abuse, using only jqyery core ?
[05:41:47] <stenno> i see
[05:42:08] <stenno> can't you even do that with a normal div ?
[05:42:14] <NET||abuse> g0bl1n: yes, it's just dom manipulation. infact some benchmarks actually say floating divs around the place renders faster than canvas
[05:42:14] <Bambus> guys ...
[05:42:15] <Bambus> here?
[05:42:20] <stenno> i would use a div and css to draw the rectangle
[05:42:33] <Bambus> how i can do the fadein plz ? http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/
[05:42:34] <Bambus> ..
[05:42:42] <g0bl1n> NET that's what I have :-) floating divs
[05:42:52] <g0bl1n> NET||abuse,  that's what I have :-) floating divs
[05:42:56] <NET||abuse> :)
[05:43:19] <stenno> Bambus, create a <img> tag would be a start
[05:43:47] <g0bl1n> NET||abuse, yet I was appending those divs to "body", but I think it makes more sense to .append them to the image element. Can't seem to do it
[05:44:45] <Bambus> stenno is there no other easy way ? i want to fadein the img witch is set in the element html .
[05:45:10] <stenno> you need a html element in order to display the picture
[05:46:03] <terryleigh> shoky: sorry I'm stuck.. how would I append the row_count on the input fields names? http://jsfiddle.net/TFaq5/1/
[05:46:54] <NET||abuse> g0bl1n: img element can't contain other inline or block levels,
[05:47:08] <Bambus> stenno what ? i have a html and there is a background with the css ...
[05:47:20] <Bambus> stenno now i want to fadein that background-image.
[05:47:31] <g0bl1n> NET||abuse, ty
[05:47:58] <stenno> Bambus, what? i don't see any markup in your jsfiddle
[05:48:07] <g0bl1n> NET||abuse, one more thing, how can I know the global position of the img element ?
[05:48:37] <Bambus> stenno k i update it for u
[05:50:23] <NET||abuse> stenno: http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/1/
[05:50:57] <Bambus> stenno look -  >http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/2/    the html background is not fadein .
[05:52:12] <stenno> Bambus, well no shit
[05:52:18] <stenno> you have to add an img element
[05:52:21] <NET||abuse> http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/3/
[05:52:24] <NET||abuse> bit better
[05:52:37] <Bambus> stenno :D
[05:53:10] <Bambus> stenno but when i make <img src="sdadas"> it will not display good .. it need be in the html .
[05:53:27] <Bambus> stenno or how you mean ? can you update the code so i can understand you more .. :/
[05:53:31] <NET||abuse> stenno: if you prefer this
[05:53:32] <NET||abuse> http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/4/
[05:54:12] <stenno> NET||abuse, does this not work..?
[05:54:44] <terryleigh> anyone? I'm just trying to include the row_count on each added row... not sure how to go about it.. http://jsfiddle.net/TFaq5/1/
[05:55:19] <NET||abuse> http://jsfiddle.net/2pMQB/5/
[05:55:20] <NET||abuse> better
[05:55:31] <stenno> NET||abuse, does this not work..?
[05:55:41] <NET||abuse> how do you mean?
[05:55:48] <stenno> does it work or not?
[05:55:52] <stenno> it looks good
[05:55:56] <NET||abuse> what i put up there works yes
[05:56:07] <stenno> NET||abuse, so you want to talk to Bambus...
[05:56:11] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: is it okay to make ajax calls and the such inside of widgets?
[05:56:19] <NET||abuse> oh, i forgot who asked the origional quesiton
[05:56:24] <NET||abuse> hah
[05:56:30] <stenno> :)
[05:56:32] <Bambus> net
[05:56:35] <NET||abuse> Bambus: is that what you're looking for?
[05:56:37] <Bambus> it seems to work
[05:57:36] <Bambus> but  can,t i do it that it will be in the html element ?
[05:58:25] <rosieres_respawn> how can I restrict find('div'); only to use first level of elements ? e.g. if there are nested ones ?
[05:58:46] <NET||abuse> Bambus: umm, not really
[05:58:59] <NET||abuse> Bambus: the html element i don't think can fadeIn like that
[05:59:00] <pachet> rosieres_respawn: .children('div')? or am i misinterpreting
[05:59:08] <NET||abuse> otherwise every child element of html will also fade in
[05:59:25] <rosieres_respawn> pachet: could be . . . i´ll try thanks !
[05:59:35] <shoky> terryleigh
[05:59:41] <stenno> i really really need a help with the jquery validate plugin: the whole message thing does not work at all. no message is displayed at all. how can i let a message be displayed? do i need any additional markup or css?
[05:59:44] <shoky> you have empty names on some of the inputs..
[06:00:06] <Bambus> NET||abuse look this is like it showing --> http://fresharea.net/
[06:00:07] <NET||abuse> Bambu: no, you ca't apply fadeIn() to html or body, you have to apply it to another element that acts as a background layer.
[06:00:10] <stenno> anyway, the documentation on http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation is wrong, it does not work like this
[06:00:12] <deiu> Hello!
[06:00:13] <terryleigh> shoky: I know.. I'll fill those in later.
[06:00:51] <terryleigh> I just want it to add the row_count to each input field, select.. to the name.. i.e. xxl2, ss2, m2 .. etc.
[06:00:51] <Bambus> NET||abuse i want to create someting like it will be at beggining #fff then the html background fadein then the #wrap fadein and at last the body background-image will fadein ...Ã¤
[06:00:56] <NET||abuse> Bambus: oh, ok , i've never written anything like that, but i see how it works.
[06:01:06] <pachet> Bambus: http://jsfiddle.net/BrKuU/
[06:01:09] <deiu> Is there a way to remove an element together with all of its children elements, using one jquery call?
[06:01:14] <shoky> terryleigh: http://jsfiddle.net/TFaq5/5/
[06:01:32] <deiu> For example, I want to remove a table row with all its cells.
[06:01:44] <NET||abuse> there ya go, pachet's attempt looks good
[06:01:49] <stenno> sn't that nice and easy?
[06:01:52] <pachet> deiu: $('tr').remoev()
[06:01:54] <pachet> ...er
[06:01:58] <pachet> you get the gist
[06:02:09] <stenno> no it isn't because it fucking doesn't work like this
[06:02:12] <deiu> pachet, thanks
[06:02:32] <deiu> but does it remove the cells as well? or does it leave the cells outside of a tr?
[06:02:48] <pachet> it removes the target element and all descendents from the dom
[06:03:08] <terryleigh> shoky: thanks! it does it for the first row.. but doesn't seem to do it for the subsequent ones?
[06:03:21] <deiu> pachet, thanks!
[06:03:42] <shoky> terryleigh: it does, you have a <tr> instead of a </tr> i think
[06:04:25] <Bambus> pachet thx .. and when i want that the html animate only from white to  the img ? how i do it ,
[06:04:43] <Bambus> pachet i mean without the bg-body.png
[06:05:55] <shoky> terryleigh: http://jsfiddle.net/TFaq5/6/
[06:06:10] <shoky> you could refactor that to make it slimmer of course
[06:06:19] <pachet> Bambus: http://jsfiddle.net/nTqqy/?
[06:06:55] <terryleigh> shoky: awesome thanks, I owe you a beer!
[06:06:58] <Bambus> pachet i mean the bg.png only fadein without the bg-body.png
[06:07:52] <shoky> ;>
[06:08:21] <Bambus> pachet look like this http://jsfiddle.net/nTqqy/1/
[06:08:46] <Bambus> pachet but i need now to apply .css to jquery repeat .. etc becuase what is when people has no javascript enabled on browser -
[06:12:33] <pachet> Bambus: er, I'm just taking stabs at what i think you're talking about, to be honest
[06:12:38] <pachet> but : http://jsfiddle.net/M4RPs/
[06:15:52] <jeffsmykil> if i am traversing xml how do i return everything under a certain node
[06:15:58] <jeffsmykil> .text() doesn't do the job
[06:17:46] <Blindie> hallo
[06:18:16] <Blindie> is there a way to check ob the mouseout is on top/bottom ore left/right on a div?
[06:18:30] <Jon47> jeffsmykil: try .html() ?
[06:18:42] <jeffsmykil> but its xml
[06:19:16] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil:  What form do you want it in?  or what do you want to do ith it?
[06:19:37] <jeffsmykil> before I was saving the whole document as xml
[06:19:42] <jeffsmykil> by just doing
[06:20:13] <jeffsmykil> $.get("data/data.xml", {}, function(xml) { var dataXML = xml};
[06:22:24] <jeffsmykil> now I want just a piece of that xml
[06:22:45] <jeffsmykil> so I tried $(xml).find(date).text();
[06:23:23] <Jon47> is date a string?
[06:23:23] <rroelofs> what does console.log($(sml).find("date")) give you?
[06:23:41] <jeffsmykil> yeah date is a string
[06:24:28] <jeffsmykil> rroelofs: that gives me the date nodes from the xml
[06:24:37] <tomasm-> dudes, what's the deal with the jquery plugins site????
[06:25:02] <Jon47> jeffsmykil: can you build a simple fiddle to demonstrate the issue?
[06:25:16] <jeffsmykil> Jon47:  pebcak
[06:25:17] <Jon47> you don' tneed to do the .get, just create the node from a string..
[06:25:22] <Jon47> ah, great
[06:25:29] <jeffsmykil> sorry for the trouble
[06:25:35] <Jon47> np
[06:25:48] <Jon47> i've heard jquery plays well with XML but never had the fortune to need to test it out
[06:26:37] <jeffsmykil> i can't stand doing it, but its probably the best way to do it
[06:26:57] <jeffsmykil> the kicker is that im just doing the xml for the test system since it will send json data in the final version
[06:27:06] <jeffsmykil> but i have no idea how to fake json data
[06:27:14] <jeffsmykil> in a static document
[06:27:37] <stenno> tomasm- well what do you think ?!?!?!?!
[06:27:48] <Jon47> json is just a javascriipt object
[06:27:51] <Jon47> couldn't be easier
[06:27:52] <stenno> tomasm- might it just stand there what the deal with it ?!?!?!?!?!
[06:27:55] <stenno> Jon47, not really
[06:28:42] <Jon47> stenno: elaborate?
[06:28:59] <stenno> well json has no function methods, for example
[06:29:00] <tomasm-> stenno, I think it's fantastic that the 'new' site isn't up but it's still worth writing an obscuring message that is going to discourage a bunch of people, and then the 'archives' (the only available site) is down as well....  there really shouldn't be an error page, it should just be a message at the top of the old site
[06:29:32] <Jon47> stenno, read up to see what i was responding to
[06:30:10] <stenno> Jon47, well your still your statement is wrong ^^"
[06:30:14] <stenno> -your
[06:30:24] <Jon47> it was imprecise but honestly, very helpful
[06:30:50] <stenno> well json stands for Javascript Object Notation
[06:31:04] <stenno> so indeed it is very closely related to js objects ;O)
[06:31:06] <stenno> :)*
[06:31:25] <Jon47> thanks for the correction ;)
[06:32:02] <jeffsmykil> ok one of the engineers just explained to me i can just make a .json file in json format and do the same thing
[06:32:38] <sacho> "the same thing"?
[06:33:03] <jeffsmykil> well i mean bring the json in like i do when the service is finally written
[06:33:07] <timing> how do I combine $('#element').click(); and $('.byclass').click(); ?  I don't want to combined the selector, but just bind both elements to the same callback
[06:33:17] <jeffsmykil> that way i wont have to convert the code i wrote for xml to work with json
[06:33:28] <timing> $($('#element'), $('.byclass')).click(fucntion(){}); is this psosible?
[06:34:02] <Jon47> timing: $('#element').add('.byclass').click(fucntion(){});
[06:34:09] <timing> thanks
[06:35:02] <timing> but if I do $element.add($byclass).click, element always contains $byclass
[06:35:05] <timing> not for this event only
[06:36:50] <sacho> $('#element,.byclass')
[06:37:14] <NET||abuse> so anyone know how i can adjust the following http://url.ie/fccb  so the slider handle doesn't overshoot the background image and also get clipped by overflow:hidden in the containing element/
[06:37:18] <NET||abuse> ?
[06:39:01] <Triex> Anyone wanna help an almost total noob =P?
[06:39:59] <NET||abuse> Triex: don't aska to ask, just ask and if someone wants to answer they will
[06:40:02] <NET||abuse> that's why we'ere here
[06:40:22] <mpeg> hello, I've got a really odd js issue where once every while I'm seeing unhandled exceptions in chrome/firefox only; I've been trying to debug it by following the jquery code but I'm now completely clueless
[06:40:24] <Triex> NET||abuse, fair call... But I'd expect people to just be all "google it"
[06:40:40] <mpeg> if anyone is familiar with the jquery internals and wants to give me a pointer, I've pasted the relevant stuff here: http://pastebin.com/xAp5xhQn
[06:40:48] <Triex> I wanna call a jquery command into a html input field - when you click into it :<
[06:41:02] <rosieres_respawn> what´s the shortes way of checking the existance of an object ?
[06:41:09] <g0bl1n> is it possible to get a CSS value from a class from a css file ?
[06:41:17] <NET||abuse> Triex: $('#idoffield').focus(function(){ //do stuff });
[06:41:36] <g0bl1n> I'd like to get the value for a css class background-color, that is not being used by any element
[06:41:44] <Triex> NET||abuse, <3 much love
[06:42:38] <MrSaints> g0bl1n, you can't interact with an external CSS file but perhaps you could load the contents of the file and find the value.
[06:43:12] <g0bl1n> MrSaints, ty
[06:43:21] <NET||abuse> var colour = g0bl1n: $("<div").attr('class','classname').css('background-color');
[06:43:28] <NET||abuse> arrg, sorry, your name got in the middel thter
[06:43:44] <g0bl1n> lol ty NET||abuse
[06:43:48] <NET||abuse> so g0bl1n it should be    var colour = $("<div").attr('class','classname').css('background-color');
[06:43:56] <NET||abuse> oh, close the div
[06:43:57] <NET||abuse> duh
[06:44:12] <g0bl1n> :-)
[06:44:36] <chasem> Trying to make a conditional onbeforeunload() in IExplorer 6 (gah!) with a flash object. No success with jQuery live. Sample here: http://pastebin.com/ne2w47hF... can anyone help??
[06:44:46] <Triex> NET||abuse, got any favourite resources for learning JS/JQ?
[06:45:52] <NET||abuse> Triex: jquery docs and practice, also douglas crockfford, (book:   javascript, the good parts )
[06:46:07] <NET||abuse> and also actually read the feedback from his Jslint tool, can be good for forming habbits
[06:46:42] <NET||abuse> although some of it is a little bit too spcecific
[06:46:47] <NET||abuse> anyway, there ya go
[06:47:04] <elderdosantos> hi people
[06:47:56] <Triex> I shall look into that book nao, and thanks :D
[06:48:11] <Triex> I'm trying to learn quickly, I know the basic structure of code etc, so I hope it's not too hard to learn it properly
[06:48:43] <NET||abuse> Triex: remember js is a prototype based language, classical OO is a little different
[06:48:47] <shoky> mpeg: can you pastebin your code that's causing the error?
[06:49:12] <rosieres_respawn> whats wrong with && ?  -> if ( $.browser.msie  ) && ( $("#flash_fallback_2").length > 0 )
[06:49:47] <mpeg> shoky: it's a relatively large web app, lots of lines of code... I know that makes it a bit confusing with only my pastebin
[06:49:56] <Triex> NET||abuse, fair call
[06:50:35] <Triex> $(function() {
[06:50:36] <Triex> 		$( "#departureDate" ).focus(datepicker(){jquery.ui.datepicker-fr.js});
[06:50:36] <Triex> 	}); <-?
[06:50:37] <mpeg> my question was more geared towards if anyone has any clue why "this" would be "window" in the context of a jquery function :( as it seems to be happening
[06:51:12] <sacho> which function
[06:51:12] <NET||abuse> Triex: is it a window event?
[06:52:41] <sie> Would you consider this code shitty? $("#export_photo")[$(this).attr("checked") ? "attr" : "removeAttr"]("disabled", "disabled");
[06:53:11] <Triex> It opens a small overlay
[06:53:28] <Triex> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[06:53:41] <Triex> By default, the datepicker calendar opens in a small overlay onFocus and closes automatically onBlur or when a date is selected. For an inline calendar, simply attach the datepicker to a div or span. <- right
[06:54:03] <NET||abuse> g0bl1n: my background-color from in memory object idea doesn't seem to be working :( ur is

[06:58:03] <NET||abuse> rgb values i mean
[06:58:32] <NET||abuse> if you just move the tmpcolour = elem.css('background-color'); line before the $('body').append(eleme); it DOESN'T work :(
[06:59:22] <NET||abuse> g0bl1n: you could create a hidden out of the way container, and append the in memory element to that hidden container then get the background-color value that way?
[06:59:52] <g0bl1n> NET||abuse, yes, that'l be the solution, have a hidden div just for that, right ?
[06:59:52] <NET||abuse> then discard the element from the contianer, or the whole container to clean up the dom
[06:59:57] <NET||abuse> yup
[07:00:05] <g0bl1n> <3
[07:00:06] <g0bl1n> :-)

[07:01:44] <shoky> Bambus you mean this? http://jsfiddle.net/BrKuU/1/
[07:02:25] <NET||abuse> create the hidden container in memory, then append that test element to it in memory also, then append the container to the document body, get the colour of the test element and then .remove() the container
[07:02:37] <NET||abuse> g0bl1n: ^^ for you
[07:04:55] <shoky> Triex that code you pasted is rong..

[07:10:28] <Triex> Hum
[07:13:41] <SleepyPikachu_> Hello all
[07:14:04] <SleepyPikachu_> Anyone feeling awake and helpful?
[07:14:44] <Brodingo_> pika
[07:14:59] <juha_> don't ask to ask, just ask
[07:15:30] <SleepyPikachu_> I'm trying to embed a slideshow/image slider into a wordpress template
[07:15:53] <SleepyPikachu_> The code produced is here http://pastebin.com/8kNhgwmj (although I've only included the relevant sections)
[07:16:03] <SleepyPikachu_> The slider isn't initialising
[07:16:29] <johnkpaul> ?document.ready @ SleepyPikachu_
[07:16:54] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu_: you need to run your code after the DOM has loaded
[07:16:57] <johnkpaul> look into document.ready
[07:17:03] <Brodingo_> SleepyPikachu_ you should load jquery first
[07:17:16] <SleepyPikachu_> Loading is different to including the script in the head?
[07:17:27] <SleepyPikachu_> or you mean I should include it before the library
[07:17:30] <Haprog> SleepyPikachu_: jQuery first, then plugins.
[07:17:35] <Brodingo_> ^
[07:18:18] <Haprog> but you still need document.ready like johnkpaul mentioned
[07:18:22] <SleepyPikachu_> that doesn't appear to have resolved it, though logically it makes sense
[07:19:21] <Brodingo_> but yeah you also need to wrap your code in a proper document ready
[07:19:24] <SleepyPikachu_> So would:
[07:19:39] <SleepyPikachu_> $jquery(window).load(function() do the trick?
[07:19:47] <SleepyPikachu_> if I wrapped my slider start code in that?
[07:19:53] <Brodingo_> unless $jquery is a variable
[07:20:22] <SleepyPikachu_> It's not, $jquery is used in place of $ because Wordpress loads jQuery in compatability mode
[07:20:30] <SleepyPikachu_> compatibility*
[07:20:33] <pachet> you can just pass a function into $
[07:20:39] <pachet> as a shorthand for document ready
[07:21:02] <pachet> $jquery(function(){/* do stuff */});
[07:21:42] <Brodingo_> well ok but $jquery isnt a thing
[07:22:01] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu_: http://pastebin.com/7KLLrMfz
[07:22:05] <pachet> i'm taking him at his word that wordpress exposes that identifier
[07:22:13] <Brodingo_> either $() or jQuery()
[07:22:15] <johnkpaul> Brodingo_: I'm assuming his wordpress install runs var $jquery = jQuery.noConflict()
[07:22:22] <Brodingo_> ohhh
[07:22:23] <pachet> ^
[07:22:24] <Brodingo_> my bad
[07:23:07] <Haprog> SleepyPikachu_: and since you mentioned window.load you should know this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3698200/window-onload-vs-document-ready
[07:24:25] <SleepyPikachu_> Thanks Haprog and everyone else for their help so far
[07:24:39] <SleepyPikachu_> So I think logically it makes most sense to wait until the document is fully loaded
[07:25:56] <Haprog> SleepyPikachu_: In most cases (and this particular one), yes.
[07:27:04] <SleepyPikachu_> So in Wordpress' syntax would $jquery(window).ready(function() { dostuff... }); achieve this?
[07:27:41] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu_: look at the link I sent you
[07:27:59] <evlh> Mini Yellow Snorlax
[07:27:59] <johnkpaul> not window, document
[07:28:00] <evlh> ;)
[07:28:00] <SleepyPikachu_> Sorry I missed that (does a red name indicate that the message has my name in it)?
[07:28:16] <pachet> red name means that its time to battle
[07:28:19] <pachet> thunderbolt!
[07:28:24] <johnkpaul> haha, depends on your client, SleepyPikachu_
[07:28:29] <johnkpaul> use your faculties of deduction
[07:28:56] <SleepyPikachu_> Pikachu is fast asleep.
[07:28:58] * CyberMaN WHY U NOT LET ME FIRE UP MY BASS?!?!!??!
[07:29:11] <evlh> North Coast 2nd wave announced today
[07:29:14] <evlh> WHO BE EXCITED
[07:29:35] <Haprog> SleepyPikachu_: normally you'd use $(function(){...}); which is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function(){...}); but in your case you need to use $jquery instead of just $
[07:30:22] <pachet> (^ note that i suggested this 5 min ago :[  )
[07:30:46] <SleepyPikachu_> Indeed, Given the present lack of success, I'm wondering whether my calls to jquery are working. Is there something javascript alert esque I can use to show me that jquery has a handle on the page?
[07:31:07] <pachet> you should get console errors if you try to call on it while its undefined
[07:31:22] <SleepyPikachu_> hmm not convinced I can view the logs :-(
[07:31:30] <pachet> ?g firebug for firefox
[07:31:30] <caniuse> pachet: Firebug - http://getfirebug.com/
[07:31:49] <SleepyPikachu_> Oh I see, I don't use firefox
[07:31:56] <evlh> firefox > *
[07:32:07] <pachet> chrome developer tools? :[
[07:32:17] <shoky> F12 -> console  or ctrl-shift-j
[07:32:20] <evlh> chrome would be great, if only they allowed better customization of their browser
[07:32:29] <SleepyPikachu_> Yup, I'm with you now
[07:32:40] <SleepyPikachu_> You are correct sir, "$jquery is not defined"
[07:32:57] <pachet> so it looks like your wp install isnt doing what its purported to do
[07:33:02] <evlh> lol
[07:33:28] <evlh> pachet, unless a plugin is also trying to load another version of jquery causing a breaking point
[07:33:30] <evlh> justsayin
[07:33:36] <SleepyPikachu_> But I could define it myself
[07:33:56] <SleepyPikachu_> with var $jquery = jQuery.noConflict();
[07:34:07] <evlh> that's a bandaid
[07:34:42] <SleepyPikachu_> true but at this point it's becoming expensive for not that much feature
[07:34:59] <pachet> :[
[07:34:59] <johnkpaul> :) if jQuery is around, why care about $jquery, SleepyPikachu_?
[07:35:10] <evlh> lol
[07:35:15] <johnkpaul> also, Haprog and pachet, you use $(func) always?
[07:35:25] <johnkpaul> instead of $(document).ready(func)
[07:35:25] <pachet> johnkpaul: no
[07:35:26] <Haprog> I do
[07:35:35] <johnkpaul> I find the latter to be much more understandable
[07:35:40] <pachet> i just throw shit in an IIFE before </body>
[07:35:53] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[07:35:57] <pachet> but some people prefer to always use listeners, so
[07:35:58] <evlh> oh guys, can you tell me the best way to prevent queueing, or stopping a fadein/fadeout? I didn't want to use animation. <_>
[07:36:11] <johnkpaul> ?stop @evlh
[07:36:11] <caniuse> evlh: http://i.imgur.com/XOUfd.png
[07:36:11] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .stop(): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[07:36:16] <Haprog> johnkpaul: ofcourse but if you do jQuery you know (or should know) what just $(func) does.
[07:36:21] <evlh> does stop, stop fadein's
[07:36:26] <johnkpaul> ?tias @evlh
[07:36:31] <evlh> tias?
[07:36:38] <johnkpaul> damn caniuse, does't havee everthing
[07:36:41] <johnkpaul> have everything*
[07:36:44] <johnkpaul> evlh: try it and see
[07:37:02] <gastly> hi guys, I have a problem. I have a list of links at the bottom of the page which on clicked shows a div with a transition. The href is '#' on the links. But when I click them the browser scrolls the page to the top, which I don't want. Any way to prevent this scrolling?
[07:37:03] <SleepyPikachu_> johnkpaul: Because I don't have a confident enough understanding of everything that Wordpress uses to be convinced that there use of compatibility mode is erroneous or pointless
[07:37:20] <SleepyPikachu_> However I now have a working slider
[07:37:22] <evlh> gastly, yes.
[07:37:23] <Haprog> I think $(func) shorthand came in some version x of jQuery so old code uses the longer version ?
[07:37:41] <Triex> Okay so here's a newb problem... http://pastebin.com/KXeFra7H
[07:37:45] <gastly> evlh, how?
[07:37:47] <Triex> I tried the most basic thing
[07:37:49] <Triex> and it's not working :P
[07:37:56] <pachet> gastly: $('a').on('click.mynamespace', function(e){/*do stuff*/ e.preventDefault();});
[07:37:57] <evlh> gastly: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7488151/how-to-prevent-page-jump-if-anchor-is-in-the-url-when-page-loads
[07:38:00] <evlh> ah.
[07:38:04] <evlh> pachet did it better.
[07:38:06] <evlh> <_>
[07:39:03] <evlh> well, that didn't work. hmph.
[07:39:09] <Triex> :<
[07:39:11] <gastly> ah cool thanks pachet and evlh, I'll try them out :)
[07:40:08] <Triex> http://pastebin.com/PPb5ecBE <- Y U NO WORK. Haha
[07:40:20] <evlh> .stop is completely breaking the jquery on the page, after a few quick clicks, the fadeins stop working ;<
[07:40:24] <jeffsmykil> anyone familiar with widget factory?
[07:40:28] <evlh> Triex, why you no jsfiddle
[07:40:42] * Triex is now looking at jsfiddle
[07:40:48] <Triex> I usually use pastebin, lol
[07:40:53] <evlh> lol
[07:41:01] <evlh> Jsfiddle.net gives people a live example so we don't need to mock it up locally
[07:41:06] <evlh> ;]

[07:41:21] <Triex> :P
[07:41:21] * evlh dies on the inside
[07:41:33] <Triex> Ah, but I'm pulling  the jquery-ui stuff from a local source
[07:41:48] <jeffsmykil> js-fiddle has jquery ui
[07:41:53] <Haprog> Triex: you sure your custom jQuery UI version has everything datepicker requires to run?
[07:42:25] <pachet> jeffsmykil: because your callback isnt called in the object scope
[07:42:29] <Triex> Neg, not sure. Should I try pulling it from the website itself?
[07:42:32] <WebDragon> morning folks :)
[07:42:53] <pachet> ?proxy @ jeffsmykil
[07:43:03] <Triex> It should have it though
[07:43:05] <Triex> :<
[07:43:06] <pachet> ... i wish bot-t would come back from vacation
[07:43:09] <Haprog> Triex: you could just download a new jquery ui and make sure you select everything needed. check the manual for what datepicker depends on.
[07:43:43] <WebDragon> is there any way (aside from adding unique id's which adds more to the css every time I need multiples on the page) to have the tabpicker be discrete per each slider-wrapper so that this http://devel.charterdejavu.com/about.php doesn't happen when I add the tabs with jquery-ui ?
[07:43:46] <Triex> Yeah, I def have it all :<
[07:43:48] <Haprog> or just select everything
[07:43:54] <smplstk> ?jquery.proxy
[07:43:55] <jeffsmykil> pachet im not sure i understand

[07:44:46] <jeffsmykil> the other function isn'
[07:44:46] <stenno|work> a kind of liquid container
[07:44:47] <evlh> lol
[07:44:56] <stenno|work> container of liquid
[07:44:58] <jeffsmykil> the other function isn't outside the scope of the object though pachet
[07:45:02] <stenno|work> usually associated with wine
[07:45:14] <Triex> I shall try a few more times
[07:45:20] <evlh> more classy, like using words not heard in normal conversation <_>
[07:45:22] <evlh> lol
[07:45:27] <pachet> jeffsmykil: in your callback, 'this' doesnt point to your object

[07:48:37] <evlh> what happened to bot-t?

[07:48:51] <juha_> caniuse: are you bot?
[07:49:02] <Brodingo_> yeah he is

[07:49:11] <jeffsmykil> that worked pachet thanks
[07:49:12] <evlh> he's just sitting there typing out replies.
[07:49:14] <evlh> lol
[07:49:15] <stenno|work> `bot
[07:49:17] <stenno|work> eh
[07:49:18] <Brodingo_> and bot-t had to go back to his robot home world to fight aliens
[07:49:26] <juha_> bot-t used to response to that question
[07:49:27] <evlh> :[
[07:49:32] <evlh> i liked bot-t better.
[07:49:33] <HappyPikachu> how do I position something at the bottom of a div?
[07:49:34] <WebDragon> and parsimonious bean-counters
[07:49:52] <Brodingo_> caniuse websockets
[07:49:53] <caniuse> Brodingo_: You can use Web Sockets with Firefox 6, and Chrome 14. http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets
[07:49:55] <WebDragon> HappyPikachu: div position relative, thing within position: absolute: bottom: 0;
[07:50:20] <evlh> so yeah, I almost pulled a stupid today.
[07:50:23] <Brodingo_> caniuse flex box
[07:50:33] <Brodingo_> eh
[07:51:05] <WebDragon> HappyPikachu: bear in mind that when you do this, you remove it from the document flow. so adding padding/margin on thing being positioned, gets tricky, if you're trying to push what it's layered over, away from it
[07:51:15] <WebDragon> so anyway back to my question
[07:51:21] <WebDragon> is there any way (aside from adding unique id's which adds more to the css every time I need multiples on the page) to have the tabpicker be discrete per each slider-wrapper so that this http://devel.charterdejavu.com/about.php doesn't happen when I add the tabs with jquery-ui ?
[07:52:13] <WebDragon> there's two sections, but they both have ALL the tabs instead of just their own section's
[07:52:31] <Bambus> what will do this ? $("#id_name").append(html,function(){  $(html).fadeIn("slow"); });
[07:52:38] <HappyPikachu> WebDragon: So I should make the containg div postion relative?
[07:52:46] <WebDragon> HappyPikachu: yeap
[07:53:02] <WebDragon> more a question for #css really
[07:53:15] <WebDragon> multipass
[07:53:16] <WebDragon> heh
[07:53:31] <HappyPikachu> and then .thingAtBottom { position: absolute: bottom: 0; } ?
[07:53:36] <WebDragon> yep
[07:53:49] <Brodingo_> yeah yeah she KNOWS ITS A MULTIPASSâ€¦. anyway we're in love
[07:54:03] <WebDragon> hahahhaha
[07:54:21] <rodd> $.data( elem, key, val ) -> elem must be a dom element? Can't be a jquery obj?
[07:54:53] <HappyPikachu> you sure Dragon, my ide is barfing at position: absolute: bottom: 0;
[07:55:18] <WebDragon> HappyPikachu: ; not : after absolute
[07:55:28] <Electric_U> Hi does anyone know of a way to cause an animation on every element with a specific class whenever it is loaded into the dom?  Like delegating but with no event...
[07:55:41] <WebDragon> use vim/gvim; less pain that way when syntax-highlighting
[07:55:43] <HappyPikachu> Sneaky...
[07:56:00] <stenno|work> vimftw
[07:56:36] <johnkpaul> stenno|work: working until vim comes up e
[07:56:37] <johnkpaul> eh*

[07:56:51] <WebDragon> vim+minibufexplorer+snipmate+surround+project+matchit plugins
[07:56:58] <HappyPikachu> The outside div has an overriding position: absolute;
[07:57:24] <WebDragon> does the inner-div have height?
[07:57:34] <HappyPikachu> no...
[07:57:43] <WebDragon> margin-bottom?
[07:57:47] <HappyPikachu> nope
[07:57:52] <HappyPikachu> just the two you gave me
[07:57:54] <WebDragon> padding-bottom?
[07:58:08] <WebDragon> jsfiddle this
[07:58:12] <WebDragon> it'll be clearer
[07:58:23] <HappyPikachu> nothing except position: absolute;bottom: 0;
[07:58:39] <WebDragon> the outside div won't override if the inside-div is position relative
[07:58:49] <HappyPikachu> jsfiddle?
[07:58:52] <WebDragon> the things inside the inside div will be positioned relatively to the inside div

[08:00:19] <d3f4ultr0> i meant modal window

[08:01:55] <evlh> d3f4ultr0, more coffee for sure
[08:02:00] <WebDragon> it's a special kind of splash screen that doesn't actually use a separate webpage
[08:02:14] <d3f4ultr0> my welcome screen is a 450x550 box which gets displayed at the center of the browser. There is a cotinue button
[08:02:17] <WebDragon> pretty sneaky trick IMHO. and nice. keeps your page relevant
[08:02:28] <WebDragon> d3f4ultr0: re-think that idea
[08:02:36] <d3f4ultr0> why?
[08:02:41] <WebDragon> splash-screens are so 90's -- this way is MUCH better
[08:02:50] <d3f4ultr0> ok
[08:02:54] <evlh> WebDragon, I think what he was asking was that he already has a modal coded, and wants to make it create a cookie on first visit, and then if said cookie exists, no longer show the modal
[08:02:55] <evlh> o_O?
[08:02:56] <WebDragon> splash-screen is NOT your main page. pagerank goes down the toilet
[08:02:56] <Keir__> if i'm trying to insert a large chunk of html into the dom is it best to store the html to be appended in a string or can anyone point me to some resources that explain creating large chunks of html in a single object?
[08:03:10] <evlh> WebDragon, he has a modal, not a splash screen
[08:03:10] <evlh> <_>
[08:03:10] <WebDragon> evlh: right, but he's thinking about the wrong problem :)
[08:03:12] <d3f4ultr0> evlh, sometime like that
[08:03:20] <WebDragon> right, this is the same sort of modal thing
[08:03:21] <CodeMonkey> I have an html table, which you can view a simplified version here: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/ . I need a way to look at and manipulate only the section dealing with MAT. Can someone recommend a way to just deal with those rows?
[08:03:26] <WebDragon> just a different way of doing it
[08:03:26] <d3f4ultr0> i got an idea using cookie ;)
[08:03:28] <evlh> modal is on the same page though, WebDragon.
[08:03:34] <d3f4ultr0> thanks evlh
[08:03:34] <evlh> lol
[08:03:38] <WebDragon> either way
[08:03:45] <WebDragon> but modals on webpages? suck
[08:03:49] <WebDragon> suck HARD
[08:03:50] <d3f4ultr0> ok
[08:04:00] <stenno|work> WebDragon, true
[08:04:01] <coldhead> d3f4ultr0: check out the jquery cookie plugin, it will simplify your life considerably
[08:04:03] <d3f4ultr0> i can try the link that you gave too
[08:04:14] <evlh> Modals on webpages have no adverse effect on SEO, because googlebot doesn't crawl js.
[08:04:22] <WebDragon> it's just a different way of thinking about what you want to do, d3f4ultr0 that I thought you would find interesting and classy-looking
[08:04:31] <d3f4ultr0> i'm using jquery to display the window
[08:04:31] <evlh> <____>
[08:04:37] <WebDragon> modals have averse effect on user experience though :\
[08:04:38] <d3f4ultr0> is modal not part of jquery?
[08:04:48] <evlh> WebDragon, quite the contrary.
[08:04:50] <stenno|work> modal is part of html
[08:04:53] <d3f4ultr0> i was under the impression that modal means window
[08:04:57] <stenno|work> in that sense
[08:05:00] <evlh> I love modals on web pages if they're done correctly
[08:05:01] <evlh> <_>
[08:05:02] <WebDragon> modals should be used as confirmation, not when you first load the webpage
[08:05:08] <d3f4ultr0> got it
[08:05:09] <evlh> oh that i agree with
[08:05:10] <evlh> lol
[08:05:11] <shoky> CodeMonkey: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/1/
[08:05:16] <WebDragon> EXACTLY
[08:05:18] <evlh> i use it for a login box on my site
[08:05:26] <d3f4ultr0> WebDragon, the window though has 2 buttons, a continue and More details button
[08:05:28] <WebDragon> yah, but you still click login link first, right?
[08:05:33] <evlh> click login, pops open a modal, ajaxes in a login form
[08:05:33] <evlh> yea
[08:05:37] <WebDragon> see?
[08:05:41] <evlh> that makes sense ;p
[08:05:42] <WebDragon> not a splash-modal
[08:05:53] <WebDragon> d3f4ultr0: no reason the splash can't have buttons on it :)
[08:05:59] <d3f4ultr0> cool
[08:06:01] <d3f4ultr0> i should try it
[08:06:13] <CodeMonkey> shoky: ty, trying it out
[08:06:14] <d3f4ultr0> the apple demo was just so confusing
[08:06:19] <evlh> lol
[08:06:56] <d3f4ultr0> how can i make that MacAir disappear?
[08:07:11] <WebDragon> http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2007/10/11/splash-pages-do-we-really-need-them/
[08:07:42] <WebDragon> confusing how? everything's black but the highlighted item. click and presto, it's still there and so is the rest of the page
[08:07:50] <HappyPikachu> Ok now I'm getting very strange behaviour
[08:07:54] <WebDragon> page fades in around it
[08:07:55] <d3f4ultr0> actually, I don't like splash too. I don't know who came up with the idea here in our office
[08:08:19] <HappyPikachu> position: absolute;bottom: 0;
[08:08:24] <smplstk> OMG, he's back guyz
[08:08:25] <HappyPikachu> oops
[08:08:29] <smplstk> ?tias
[08:08:30] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:08:33] <HappyPikachu> http://www.edesix.com/?page_id=149
[08:08:40] <smplstk> A++ would trigger again.
[08:08:53] <HappyPikachu> that's what I get when I set the effect to scrollUp
[08:08:53] <smplstk> ?mlmlm
[08:08:54] <bot-t> much like multi-level marketing
[08:09:00] <d3f4ultr0> WebDragon, how can I make the computer vanished?
[08:09:13] <d3f4ultr0> the MacAir picture on the demo page?
[08:09:14] * evlh gives d3f4ultr0 a magic hat
[08:09:17] <HappyPikachu> but when I set it to fade it changes to that
[08:09:19] <WebDragon> different scripting
[08:09:31] <WebDragon> it's the concept that's different
[08:09:32] <shoky> CodeMonkey: and if you want more flexibility then do it like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/2/
[08:09:47] <WebDragon> presenting someone with a modal dialog when they haven't clicked anything is a usability no-no
[08:10:00] <WebDragon> i.e. using it as a sort of splash-screen for more/continue
[08:10:01] <Keir__> if i have a div stored in an object, how can i put html inside the div within the object?
[08:10:05] <WebDragon> bad idea
[08:10:23] <Brodingo_> HappyPikachu you need to use unique ids or classes
[08:10:28] <WebDragon> rethink the idea from a different angle, using the nicer way of doing splash screens as a jumping-off point if you still need a splash
[08:10:30] <Brodingo_> i see two #slider
[08:10:36] <evlh> cannot have two of the same id's
[08:10:38] <WebDragon> I see two pan pizzas
[08:10:39] <evlh> on the same page
[08:10:39] <shoky> Keir__: with .html(...)
[08:10:54] <WebDragon> Brodingo_++
[08:11:02] <Keir__> so object.html("node to put inside") ?
[08:11:04] <Brodingo_> HappyPikachu also make sure only your slides are in your slideshow container, your controls are being counted as a 'slide'
[08:11:06] <WebDragon> validators ftw
[08:11:18] <HappyPikachu> I see
[08:11:20] <shoky> Keir__: i dont know what 'object' is  or what your string has.....
[08:11:34] <WebDragon> HappyPikachu: I gotta crapton of different sliders on this site, all custom-scripted. www.charterdejavu.com
[08:11:38] <Keir__> so if object was <div></div>
[08:11:43] <shoky> Keir__:   jqObject.html("<HTML TO PUT INSIDE>")
[08:11:45] <HappyPikachu> Woop woop
[08:11:50] <HappyPikachu> Who's a happy pikachu
[08:11:51] <Keir__> cheers
[08:11:53] * HappyPikachu is
[08:11:55] <CodeMonkey> shoky: the end result is I need to manipulate all that HTML, so in this case, I think I could manipulate whatever is returned by 'rows', and replace the existing HTML?
[08:12:07] <Brodingo_> HappyPikachu lols
[08:12:17] <shoky> CodeMonkey: if that's what you wanna do...
[08:12:28] <pachet> Keir__: $('<div/>').append('<span>foo</span>'), or whatever
[08:12:31] <evlh> \o/ SHOKY IS HERE!
[08:12:41] <shoky> CodeMonkey: you can manipulate those rows and it'll affect the DOM yep
[08:12:56] * shoky hi5 evlh
[08:13:00] * WebDragon goes to have a cig and ponder his question some more before re-asking it in here
[08:13:07] <evlh> \o
[08:13:20] <shoky> }__{
[08:13:23] <Zeph88> I have an array I need to loop through, it is important that I know the number of the item it is on. SO I thought i'd use a for loop... but when the loop runs the div just keeps fading wth the same text... I have narrowed it down to somthing malformed with the rewrite of the html... any thoughts? http://pastebin.com/irZVmZ5D
[08:13:31] <Keir__> when your creating html like so object = $('</div>', { attributes: attribute }))
[08:13:38] <Keir__> do you have to add the class with the addClass function?
[08:13:51] <Keir__> or can it be inside the curly braces?
[08:13:57] <pachet> it can
[08:13:58] <shoky> you can add it in the curly braces but put 'class' in quotes
[08:14:01] <pachet> ^
[08:14:06] <CodeMonkey> shoky: it is. Oh, so it's by reference... hmmm, basically I need to reorder the lines. I thought I'd enumerate through each row, extracting what I need, and building new HTML in memory, then replace the existing HTML
[08:14:17] <Bambus> document ready is when page loads ?
[08:14:29] <shoky> its when the DOM is ready, during the page load
[08:14:58] <Keir__> thx again :)
[08:15:17] <terryleigh> when loading an external html file, are you supposed to use .load or .ajax?
[08:15:26] <shoky> CodeMonkey: you can do that.. you can also just .detach() rows and then put them back in the DOM with .append() or other method
[08:15:52] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: depends on your purpose, is it to load into a particular part of the current DOM?
[08:16:04] <shoky> CodeMonkey: the latter way would be more performant and less messy so.. it's recommended :P
[08:16:36] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: it's to load a row in a table.. nothing hectic
[08:16:38] <CodeMonkey> shoky: let me post a better example so I can better demonstrate... sec.
[08:16:44] <Bambus> guys look http://fresharea.net/ why when you enter first time the page it nothing happens and when you click then next time it start doing the fades... i need use someting other then document ready ? here is my code http://pastebin.com/9UxJsgEH
[08:16:47] <johnkpaul> then use .load, terryleigh
[08:17:06] <terryleigh> thanks
[08:17:28] <johnkpaul> Bambus: click on what the next time?
[08:17:31] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: no problem
[08:17:40] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: I do need to load it into a variable though..
[08:17:58] <terryleigh> makes some changes then append it...
[08:18:38] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: then use ajax :)
[08:18:41] <shoky> ;D
[08:19:03] <rodd> how may I queue animations?
[08:19:14] <shoky> rodd: they're queued by default
[08:19:17] <Bambus> johnkpaul now .. 				try load the page first time it happens nothing and when you click another time it start doing the fadeins ...
[08:19:31] <Bambus> johnkpaul open another browser it happens just the first time.
[08:19:42] <rodd> I have an array with elements that must be animated, I go through each of them through a while loop applying an animate call
[08:19:44] <shoky> rodd: unless you mean animations on different elements
[08:19:46] <shoky> yah
[08:19:55] <rodd> but they seem to animate together
[08:20:03] <shoky> yeah each has a seperate queue
[08:20:04] <Bambus> johnkpaul or it first show the page for a milisecound and then it hide...
[08:20:07] <rodd> ah
[08:20:08] <rodd> i see
[08:20:25] <rodd> in that case, would .queue make any difference?
[08:20:26] <shoky> so you'd need to either fire the next animation on the previous's callback
[08:20:28] <johnkpaul> Bambus: load events have some cavetas you need to be aware of
[08:20:29] <johnkpaul> Bambus: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:20:30] <shoky> rodd: nope
[08:20:32] <rodd> touche
[08:20:34] <rodd> callback
[08:20:37] <rodd> thanks shoky
[08:20:39] <shoky> if that works for you cool
[08:20:41] <shoky> ;)
[08:21:03] <shoky> well actually callbacks it is anyways, deferreds or nto
[08:21:05] <shoky> not
[08:21:06] <shoky> nvm
[08:21:15] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: thanks.. I'm using ajax, but it's doing something really odd. it's retrieving the file.. but leaving off the first and last line.. the <tr>'s ?
[08:21:49] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: check the network tab of your debugger, are you sure that the <tr>s are coming from your backend?
[08:21:57] <pachet> Zeph88: https://gist.github.com/2836960
[08:22:09] <Bambus> johnkpaul so how do it .. ? look when you press F5 it just hide anything then u press on browser address and click the domain and it again show for a milisecound the full page and then it just hide..
[08:22:16] <jeffsmykil> pachet the widget instance is basically a name space right?
[08:22:24] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: it's leaving them out?
[08:22:26] <shoky> rodd: hmm you could also .pipe(..) the animations if you wanna get into that :P it might end up cleaner
[08:22:33] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: I don't know, you tell me
[08:23:01] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: haha, that's what I'm saying.. it's leaving the first and last line out.. if I put a comment as the first line it goes all stupid.
[08:23:14] <johnkpaul> what is "it" terryleigh?
[08:23:28] <WebDragon> hrm
[08:23:33] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: .ajax
[08:23:37] <rodd> shoky, thanks, will read more about pipe
[08:24:08] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: and you have confirmed in the network tab of your debugger that your backend _is_ sending it correctly?
[08:24:11] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ terryleigh
[08:24:12] <bot-t> terryleigh, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:25:01] <pachet> jeffsmykil: basically
[08:25:16] <pachet> or an object within a namespace, i guess would be more precise
[08:25:16] <jeffsmykil> so why cant I do $.ui.timeline.printDate(true, 0, 6);
[08:25:21] <jeffsmykil> instead of using proxy
[08:26:27] <CodeMonkey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/5/ with that, I'm only insterested in MAT 090 and MAT 095. All other rows I could care less about. Once filtered down to those rows, I need to look at the Title column, and group, for example Prealgebra A1, Prealgebra B1, and all the C1's, then all A2 with B2 and C2, etc. Make sense?
[08:26:31] <WebDragon> http://devel.charterdejavu.com/res/java/about-slider.js how do I make the tabpicker's discrete to each layout-slider-wrapper when populating them ?
[08:26:41] <WebDragon> s/'s/s/
[08:26:41] <CodeMonkey> shoky: make that http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/6/
[08:26:59] <Zeph88> I revised my script from earlier: http://pastebin.com/3kpFK9sx ... this snippet is only displaying the last item in the array I'm trying to loop through. Thoughts?
[08:27:19] <WebDragon> each tabpicker should only have elements from its respective wrapping layout-slider-wrapper
[08:28:07] <NoiseEee> Zeph88: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62
[08:28:33] <pachet> jeffsmykil: i guess you could ( lost your paste)
[08:28:41] <pachet> jeffsmykil: might want to read http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/tips-for-developing-jquery-ui-widgets/
[08:31:16] <WebDragon> oh wait, there we go
[08:31:22] <Triex> okay I haven't got it working yet.. fml
[08:32:16] <brettster> Hey guys - I'm using jcycles permalinks. I
[08:32:22] <CodeMonkey> shoky: did that make sense?
[08:32:26] <pheenix> quick question, how do I check if an html element exists inside a selector? I used find() but I don't know how to verify if the find() is empty or not. I tried checking with jQuery.isEmptyObject() but that doesnt do anything ...
[08:32:33] <brettster> i'm wondering if there is anyways to link to specific slides
[08:32:39] <brettster> outside of the page that the slider on
[08:32:48] <brettster> so - let's say the slider is on the home page
[08:33:01] <Triex> I downloaded all new versions of the jquery-ui stuff
[08:33:04] <Triex> with everything
[08:33:14] <brettster> on the internal page, I want to link to one of those slides, and have that link go to back to the homepage and start on that slide
[08:33:22] <Brodingo_> pheenix .length
[08:33:31] <Zeph88> NoiseEee: I'm not understanding what that's supposed to help me with. Maybe I'm overlooking somthing.
[08:34:30] <Zeph88> I think I've just incorrectly placed my delay, because if I alert(index), I can see the loop is running okay, just not updating my text.
[08:35:18] <NoiseEee> Zeph88: Compliments is an array?
[08:35:37] <Zeph88> Yes
[08:36:55] <Zeph88> I guess the more direct question would be, what is the appropriate way to delay between every item when using each()
[08:37:04] <CodeMonkey> did shoky leave me hanging?
[08:37:40] <lxsameer> i'm looking for a good data table plugin, do you know any?
[08:39:17] <NoiseEee> Zeph88: you don't delay between items when iterating
[08:39:32] <NoiseEee> Zeph88: certainly you could send the items to a function that delays presentation of the data/text....
[08:39:32] <CodeMonkey> anyone else? http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/7/ <- Looking at the title column, I need to rearrange the rows and group A1 with B1 and C1, then A2 with B2 and C2, etc... any ideas?
[08:40:44] <pachet> ?g setTimeout @ Zeph88
[08:40:47] <bot-t> Zeph88, window.setTimeout - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[08:40:57] <pachet> bot-t, back from alienslaying i see
[08:40:59] <bot-t> pachet, Couldn't find "back from alienslaying i see" in jQuery Docs.
[08:41:33] * pachet raises his glass @ bot-t
[08:41:39] <Zeph88> Ah so if in the loop I did somthing like displayCompliment(index); the function displayCompliment would contain the timer?
[08:41:50] <shoky> CodeMonkey, sec
[08:41:57] <CodeMonkey> shoky: k
[08:42:00] <pachet> just dont handle timers in loops
[08:42:02] <pachet> use callbacks
[08:42:49] <shoky> rodd: i just made this - http://jsfiddle.net/D9v5A/  might help you
[08:43:00] <shoky> <3 piping deferreds
[08:43:59] <shoky> ?tell
[08:44:00] <bot-t> shoky, Syntax: tell <nick> <message>
[08:44:00] <rodd> shoky, awesome, thanks I'm still reading about deferreds on jquery docs.
[08:44:22] <shoky> ?tell Whirl3d just smth i fiddled maybe you'd find helpful - http://jsfiddle.net/D9v5A/
[08:44:22] <bot-t> shoky, Okay.
[08:44:35] <Triex> So I've still got the same issue, it wont pop up at all - tried updating all the jqui stuff, got literally everything..  anyone know what I can do? http://pastebin.com/eU8D19LF
[08:45:27] <WebDragon> http://devel.charterdejavu.com/about.php  there. tabs all fixed now
[08:45:34] <WebDragon> silly thinko
[08:47:32] <Triex> :<
[08:50:50] <Triex> Oh sweet! I got it working
[08:51:01] <Triex> But now the CSS is fuxed
[08:51:02] <Triex> -.-
[08:51:10] <Triex> the joys of coding
[08:51:29] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: still having problems, the response on the network tab is correct, but it's still missing the first and last line :( http://hostinsight.com/assets/jb-form/
[08:51:49] <Aaronds> Hi, how can I get the id of an element while using the append method? $('.element').append($(this).id); doesn't work ._.
[08:52:14] <shoky> CodeMonkey: i didnt understand you really.. all of those rows are MAT 090 no?
[08:52:20] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: that's actually correct, .html is equivalent to .innerHTML
[08:52:31] <terryleigh> ah..
[08:52:32] <johnkpaul> why do you want the outerhtml?
[08:52:52] <terryleigh> well I want to include the whole row when I append to the table.
[08:53:08] <CodeMonkey> shoky: yes, but look at the title column. Prealgebra A1, needs brouped with Prealgebra B1, and all the Prealgebra C1's
[08:53:12] <johnkpaul> ok, that should work fine terryleigh
[08:53:23] <johnkpaul> the line where you append, should work
[08:53:26] <CodeMonkey> grouped*
[08:53:51] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: but it's not though..
[08:54:10] <shoky> CodeMonkey uhmmm that's a totally different issue..
[08:54:24] <shoky> CodeMonkey: you're the code-monkey. monkey some code ;)
[08:54:25] <terryleigh> the alert doesn't show all the html.. and if I change the in "row.html" like add a comment, it doesn't display anything.
[08:54:43] <CodeMonkey> shoky: that's why I was thinking of just enumerating through each line, and rebuilding a new table in memory, then replacing it
[08:54:44] <MrTool> Hi there, i got a problem with my loading counter, if i try to update an text element in an foreach i only see the start and then it jumps to the end, but it correctly iterate trough the whole loop
[08:54:54] <shoky> CodeMonkey: would it help if i show you how to remove a line and insert it in another place ?
[08:55:24] <shoky> CodeMonkey: this kind of stuff you usually do on your data model itself, not on DOM elements that are already in view..
[08:55:35] <CodeMonkey> shoky, how about remove a line, and insert it into a new set of rows, which I will eventually swap out with the existing rows
[08:55:42] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: in looking in the dom, it seems to append exactly what you give newrow
[08:55:55] <shoky> CodeMonkey: anything's possible...
[08:55:59] <CodeMonkey> shoky: I know, but in this case, I can't touch the code that generates the data
[08:56:22] <shoky> CodeMonkey: ok so filter and get the lines you wanna move, and move them
[08:56:35] <shoky> and find where you wanna move them to, of course
[08:57:02] <shoky> i'm not gonna implement a grid sorting algorithm for you, if that's what you were after ;P
[08:57:23] <CodeMonkey> shoky: that's exactly where I get stuck. I can code like crazy, but jQuery syntax stumps me still. How would I create a new var for the rows. Loop through the rows we've extracted, and push those into the new var

[08:58:04] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: the 3 row and after it messes up...
[08:58:41] <shoky> CodeMonkey:  rows is a jq collection of your rows. you can use the jquery .each() method to loop over them
[08:59:09] <johnkpaul> terryleigh: the only thing that I can tell immediately is that your backend is sending a different status for some reason
[08:59:11] <johnkpaul> for those new rows
[08:59:34] <CodeMonkey> shoky: ok, well, I'm moving in the right direction, but I have to run and do some errands during my lunch break. I'll be back in an hour or so and might hit you up again. Many thanks!
[08:59:38] <shoky> CodeMonkey:  like:  rows.each(function() {  var row = $(this);  row.detach();   row.find('whatever..').text('whatever');   etc }
[08:59:48] <shoky> oks bon apetit
[09:00:09] <johnkpaul> oh terryleigh, you are running different code
[09:00:15] <johnkpaul> remove the .html() on line 33
[09:00:46] <CodeMonkey> shoky: merci
[09:00:50] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you around?
[09:01:10] <terryleigh> johnkpaul: haha, my word.. one little bit of code resulted in so much hair loss.. THANKS!
[09:03:24] <jeffsmykil> pachet this doen't make sense to me
[09:03:24] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/KAwVB3RR
[09:03:47] <johnkpaul> :) terryleigh, no problem
[09:03:55] <jeffsmykil> it seems like it should work fine
[09:06:58] <jeffsmykil> anyone?
[09:08:02] <revagomes> Hi! Can I use a map to pass different instructions for a bunch of selectors using  the same event in a .delegate function?
[09:08:58] <johnkpaul> revagomes: no, but you could write a jquery plugin to make that abstraction yourself
[09:09:45] <revagomes> johnkpaul, I'll try to do that. thx ;]
[09:11:22] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: what's your issue?
[09:11:50] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul I dont understand why line 39 doesn't work correctly
[09:12:23] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: where do you pass the widget argument?
[09:12:49] <jeffsmykil> line 26
[09:13:23] <johnkpaul> the second parameter to ajax success is the textStatus
[09:13:25] <johnkpaul> not the widget
[09:13:33] <johnkpaul> remove the widget parameter, and it won't be shadowed
[09:13:43] <johnkpaul> on line 38, remove widget
[09:14:13] <jeffsmykil> still not hitting printDates
[09:14:15] <jeffsmykil> oh wait
[09:14:24] <jeffsmykil> ok that works now
[09:14:37] <jeffsmykil> this is going to be a long day of slow progress thank you johnkpaul
[09:15:32] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: what is your background? Have you written javascript before?
[09:15:56] <jeffsmykil> yes, but I'm by no means good, getting better along the way
[09:16:00] <jeffsmykil> kind of thrust into this role
[09:16:26] <johnkpaul> you might want to read through eloquent javascript
[09:16:28] <johnkpaul> ?learn @ jeffsmykil
[09:16:29] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:16:40] <johnkpaul> ?g eloquent javascript @ jeffsmykil
[09:16:42] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming - http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[09:17:37] <jeffsmykil> yeah, I have looked over them
[09:17:43] <jeffsmykil> I just had an issue with scope i guess
[09:23:22] <chuwiey> Hi all, I find myself having scripts where I am running through a json object ($.each) and creating elements with the values inside the object, my code becomes messy with html and/or several jquery methods for creating elements. I know there is a solution with templating engines, but are they the best option? and if yes, which ones? Thanks!
[09:23:55] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[09:25:30] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: are template engines the best option?
[09:25:59] <johnkpaul> compared to stringing together html in your javascript? yes
[09:27:50] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: thank  you very much. where can i read up on the features of templating engines? (thanks)
[09:29:06] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: that link should give you some information
[09:29:16] <johnkpaul> on the left side, there are questions that you can answer
[09:29:29] <johnkpaul> if you need more info abou tthose feautres, look at the docs for each project
[09:30:13] <chuwiey> johnkpaul: thank you very much
[09:30:20] <johnkpaul> chuwiey: no problem
[09:31:51] <acalbaza> is it possible to set contentType on a jsonp ajax request across domains?  although i set contentType, it always reverts back to application/json... not sure what im doing wrong.
[09:32:22] <johnkpaul> albemuth: jsonp is by definition json
[09:33:07] <albemuth>  I think you meant acalbaza, johnkpaul
[09:33:18] <johnkpaul> :) oops, sorry
[09:33:19] <acalbaza> true... but my service can accept other content types.
[09:33:23] <poppiez> how do you make ajax success fire only when it's an actual 200 OK response? right now, I have to handle error logic inside the success handler and error handler because the success callback isn't always success
[09:33:41] <johnkpaul> acalbaza: then don't use jsonp?
[09:34:26] <johnkpaul> poppiez: what is the response code?
[09:34:52] <poppiez> johnkpaul: e.g. a 204 No Content fires the successs callback
[09:34:56] <johnkpaul> success should only fire when it's a 2something
[09:35:05] <poppiez> I just want the error callback to fire in that case
[09:35:15] <johnkpaul> ah, that's correct behavior from the docs, poppiez
[09:35:16] <poppiez> otherwise, I have to make a condition inside each success callback
[09:35:20] <johnkpaul> why not send a error repsonse code
[09:35:22] <johnkpaul> when there is an error
[09:35:31] <johnkpaul> perhaps 404 is more appropriate
[09:35:35] <poppiez> johnkpaul: because 204 No Content is the proper response if there's no content
[09:35:45] <poppiez> and that's how the API I'm working on works
[09:36:01] <johnkpaul> then you should use complete and check yourself manually
[09:36:14] <johnkpaul> or use success and check yourself manually
[09:36:20] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't support what you're asking for OOTB
[09:36:36] <psyolus> Is there any standard way to use window.onbeforeunload that does not disrupt any other uses of it?
[09:37:01] <psyolus> Ah. Just bind
[09:38:41] <Keir__> if im creating a relatively complex piece of html is there a better way than just creating each node of the html as a seperate object then appending them together ?
[09:39:00] <johnkpaul> Keir__: http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[09:39:02] <Keir__> i've made something that works but it just looks ugly
[09:40:39] <catcher> I have an element that toggles hide/show on click.  I'm trying to hide that element with a click on the body - it works, but the element never gets to show since the button click is also a click on the body. Ideas?
[09:40:59] <johnkpaul> ?stopPropagation @ catcher
[09:41:00] <bot-t> catcher, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[09:41:46] <catcher> johnkpaul, I've given that a shot with no results yet - it should go in the body click handler, no?
[09:42:32] <johnkpaul> no, in the button click handler, unless I'm missunderstanding what you're trying to do
[09:45:27] <incognit0> Does a better resource than this for jQueryUI css exist? http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/API
[09:47:37] <catcher> johnkpaul, in my first attempt, I forgot to define 'event' so it errored, but it worked correctly.  When I defined event, it stopped working.  To simulate the error, I tried returning false, and that works. Does returning false stop propagation too?
[09:48:09] <johnkpaul> yes, return false is the same as event.preventDefault() && event.stopPropagaion()
[09:48:20] <johnkpaul> ^ @ catcher
[09:48:36] <catcher> johnkpaul, ahh, event.preventDefault, ty.
[09:58:50] <alfik> Hello all, im using document.ready in window onload this works on all browsers good exept IE there are some milisecounds when the page display first...  http://pastebin.com/89aheyDg, http://fresharea.net
[10:04:23] <Keir__> can anyone suggest improvements to this abomination :P? http://pastebin.com/mxG0w1qk
[10:11:51] <rodd> Keir__,  perhaps a templating system? ex mustache
[10:12:25] <psyolus> If you bind to beforeunload multiple times, does it just use the result of the last bound function?
[10:13:11] <alfik> ?
[10:13:24] <khmer__> psyolus: yes
[10:15:03] <CodeMonkey> still there shoky ?
[10:15:34] <sayd> is there a good pretty printer for js? I just want to see some escaped json intented and formatted for human readability
[10:16:52] <CodeMonkey> sayd: you are looking for an editor that automatically formats and colorizes you js? (all printers are good for printing ;) )
[10:17:30] <shoky> CodeMonkey yea
[10:17:33] <sayd> CodeMonkey: yeah something that adds line breaks and intents
[10:17:36] <sayd> *indents
[10:18:14] <CodeMonkey> sayd: I use Notepad++ and am pretty happy with it. I don't think it will format existing code though
[10:18:25] <Zeph88> So I am having a ton of trouble with this. I have 3 arrays, each the same length. I need to loop through them and fade the content to divs with 15 seconds inbetween. Is there any decent tut on how to do this laying around?
[10:19:05] <CodeMonkey> shoky: ok, starting my code again. In your code, you do row.detach. Can I then attach that to another variable?
[10:19:36] <Keir__> I'd recommend notepad++ as an editor
[10:19:38] <CodeMonkey> shoky: I guess I could go read something ;)
[10:21:13] <poppiez> any way to make jquery fire "success" callback only when HTTP 200 OK is returned? looking at the "statusCode" option in $.ajax but not entirely what I want
[10:21:51] <shoky> CodeMonkey: yeah you can later put row in the DOM  e.g.  $('table').append( row )    or:   jqObjOfSomeOtherRow.after( row )
[10:22:12] <shoky> actually dont append to 'table' maybe cause of the implicit tbody
[10:22:23] <danzik17> poppiez: what code is it firing success for that you don't want?  and if you only want to handle 200 as your success, then why wouldn't statusCode work?
[10:23:06] <alfik> guys how i can use the hide without the document ready function ? http://pastebin.com/89aheyDg
[10:23:11] <poppiez> danzik17: because "statusCode" is only an extra layer. especially when working with deferreds, I want done to fire using $.when only when all requests have fired 200 OK. I don't want them to fire on e.g. 204 No Content
[10:23:49] <shoky> alfik: why dont you want to put it in the doc ready handler?
[10:23:58] <poppiez> problem is, "success" fires even though the request wasn't actually a success with data from the API to play with
[10:24:28] <poppiez> so everytime I implement the API I have to do a condition inside the success callback to make sure it's actually a success, which is a pain in the ass
[10:24:57] <alfik> shoky cuz on IE it dont works like it should it show first the page for a milisecound .. so i want fix it that it work too for IE like chrome and ff
[10:25:15] <shoky> alfik: just hide them in your CSS ...
[10:25:54] <shoky> Zeph88: if you jsfiddle something we can help
[10:26:19] <alfik> shoky okey but this is the problem all doing they hide up css and when some ppl has by mistake off the javascript what then ? they could not see the page..
[10:26:51] <alfik> shoky i want to make a site witch will work even javascript will be "by mistake off"
[10:26:56] <CodeMonkey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/8/ <- Syntax error....
[10:27:14] <shoky> alfik: before the doc ready handler you can't be sure that those elements even exist yet, so there is nothing to .hide()
[10:28:04] <poppiez> danzik17: also a guy here wanting the same as me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7841235/adding-a-condition-for-success-or-error-using-jquery-ajax-wordpress
[10:28:18] <shoky> CodeMonkey: newrows is undefined and you're .append()ing to it...
[10:28:35] <shoky> CodeMonkey: you can only .append() to a jquery object
[10:28:39] <alfik> shoky so i can fix it by making someting like $('body').css ... displaynone ?
[10:28:47] <CodeMonkey> shoky: ohhh, I see
[10:28:56] <danzik17> poppiez: it's pretty hardcoded into ajax - either wrapping your ajax calls with your own deferred, OR - you can use an ajaxTransport, but that could get unintuitive turning success into some kind of failure codes
[10:29:11] <CodeMonkey> shoky: how can I declare an empty object as a jquery object, and then assign rows to it?
[10:29:23] <BrotherRodriguez> Hey folks, I have a site that uses the scrollintoview plugin (https://github.com/litera/jquery-scrollintoview), but there is some sort of conflict going on with the CSS. I have a fiddle w/o CSS that works as expected and one with CSS that does not. Any ideas about what sort of properties I'm missing that are causing conflicts? There's more information in the info of the fiddles. Working (no CSS): http://jsfiddle.net/beej/vEGxg/1
[10:29:25] <BrotherRodriguez> /     Non-working (w/ CSS): http://jsfiddle.net/beej/vEGxg/
[10:29:36] <shoky> alfik: it doesnt matter if its .css or .hide  , the DOM elements are not ready yet for you to manipulate with javascript
[10:29:55] <krz> wtf is wrong with this: $('#top_hits ul:eq(0) li[data-top-hit-id="20120530/cfazzini/song/test"]').animate({backgroundColor: 'red'}).delay(50).animate({backgroundColor: '#333'});
[10:30:08] <shoky> krz its FUGLY
[10:30:13] <krz> it doesn't animate the li element
[10:30:24] <krz> all i get is [li.clearfix]
[10:30:31] <shoky> are you using the color plugin..?
[10:30:36] <shoky> or jquery ui or whatever it is
[10:30:45] <krz> its a simple animate
[10:30:51] <krz> why do i need a plugin
[10:31:16] <shoky> if you'd bothered to read the docs for .animate, you'd see
[10:31:18] <shoky>  The jQuery UI project extends the .animate() method by allowing some non-numeric styles such as colors to be animated.
[10:31:26] <Kingsy> guys. what is wrong with using next() like this --> http://jsfiddle.net/qxRNZ/ <--
[10:31:48] <shoky> krz: or how about the first line of the docs: The .animate() method allows us to create animation effects on any numeric CSS property.
[10:31:52] <shoky> since when is 'red' numeric
[10:31:59] <alfik> shoky do you have any suggestions how to make it work .. i mean there must be a way ? or only when i apply direct to .css display none...
[10:32:18] <krz> ummm shoky: its still supposed to work
[10:32:24] <krz> $('#top_hits ul:eq(0) li[data-top-hit-id="20120530/cfazzini/song/test"]').animate({backgroundColor: '#FF3700'}).delay(50).animate({backgroundColor: '#333'}); returns the same result
[10:32:34] <shoky> alfik: i dont give a shit about users who disable their javascript, so i cant help you ;)
[10:32:41] <krz> and second. if you read the document. "The jQuery UI project extends the .animate()"
[10:32:45] <krz> thats referring to jquery UI
[10:32:51] <shoky> krz why is it supposed to work
[10:32:54] <psyolus> If I wanted to create a special type of UI dialog, would would be the best way to accomplish that?
[10:33:00] <shoky> exactly, its NOT referring to jquery, which is what you are using
[10:33:05] <psyolus> Just an object that encapsulates a dialog?
[10:33:08] <CodeMonkey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/9/ <- I believe that's right, no?
[10:33:16] <Kingsy> it says next() is not a function ? wtf? next() is a part of the jquery lib isnt it?
[10:33:41] <Keir__> is there a way to store html in an object and add attributes that would be the index of a loop, without creating the object inside the loop?
[10:34:02] <krz> why is it supposed to work? because something like this does: $('#top_hits ul:eq(0) li[data-top-hit-id="20120530/cfazzini/song/test"] p.total').animate({color: '#FF3700'}).delay(50).animate({color: '#333'});
[10:34:20] <psyolus> wat
[10:34:29] <craea> hi! please tell me what's wrong with my script -> http://codepad.org/A6GSP1Zf :D
[10:34:35] <alfik> shoky its not about users who disable .. its about toolbars shits etc viruses ... it disable js and then ppl dont know why and i can,t hear then crying this peoples why i can,t see this .. why i can,t see this ... you know ? :D
[10:35:06] <krz> shoky: you are right though. it doesn't work with non numerical colors
[10:35:19] <krz> but why doesn't it work with backgroundColor
[10:35:26] <shoky> CodeMonkey:  you're missing  );  to close your .each(
[10:35:32] <alfik> shoky thats why im trying do thinks without direct input to .css
[10:35:49] <CodeMonkey> shoky: doh! ty
[10:36:02] <shoky> CodeMonkey: also you can't append to an empty jq obj, cause append appends inside an element
[10:36:03] <Keir__> craea: is it because where you're trying to post id:id - whereas id is a parameter of the function so it be param:param?
[10:36:20] <CodeMonkey> shoky: any idea how to do what I'm wanting to do?
[10:37:01] <dilvie> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/qxRNZ/1/
[10:37:17] <shoky> CodeMonkey: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/10/
[10:37:23] <Kingsy> dilvie: ohhhhh I see
[10:37:27] <craea> ya Keir__
[10:37:37] <dilvie> Kingsy: ;)
[10:37:39] <evlh> gah
[10:38:03] <Keir__> ^^
[10:38:20] <evlh> fucking meeting in 20 minutes.
[10:38:21] <CodeMonkey> shoky: ah voila! One step closer
[10:38:23] <Keir__> i must be learning, usually i'm only here to ask things :p
[10:38:26] * evlh pouts
[10:38:28] <dilvie> Kingsy: "this" in the context of an event handler is the dom element. If you want to use jQuery methods on it, you have to wrap it with jQuery first. =)
[10:38:44] <alfik> CodeMonkey voila :D :D
[10:38:58] <Kingsy> dilvie: leg - end.. thanks man
[10:39:35] <dilvie> Kingsy: Commonly you'll see a first-line like this: var $el = $(el); -- that way you cache the jQuery object so you don't have to re-wrap it every time you use it. =)
[10:39:44] <raj> can I spin a character?
[10:39:52] <dilvie> Then you can do $el.someMethod();
[10:40:00] <dilvie> as much as you like. =)
[10:40:04] <Kingsy> bang
[10:45:28] <Keir__> if i have html in an object and some of the attributes values are defined by variables, and i access the object from within a function, which changes the values of the variable, will the value of my attributes change too, or whatever is defined initally be retained?
[10:46:25] <CodeMonkey> shoky: ok, getting there. So, as a test, I exited the function after appending 4 rows. Now, I want to remove all MAT rows, and replace them with my newrows. (This isn't the final desired functionality of course, but it increases my understanding)
[10:46:34] <CodeMonkey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/12/
[10:57:48] <CodeMonkey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/13/ Am I on the right path?
[10:57:55] <CodeMonkey> did we have a netsplit?
[10:58:27] <shoky> mm did we?
[10:58:35] <shoky> i dont log quits/joins
[10:58:40] <tw2113> same
[10:58:43] <tw2113> got too annoying
[10:58:51] <shoky> it was the first thing i did when i joined
[10:58:59] <CodeMonkey> :)
[10:59:12] <Eviltwin> What's the best way to run a jsperf against a slew of browsers?
[11:00:59] <shoky> CodeMonkey: mmm why are you removing rows both in the loop, and also afterwards? donno what yer doin
[11:00:59] <johnkpaul-afk> Eviltwin: tell all of your friends and post it here and some will click on it
[11:01:16] <shoky> heh
[11:02:21] <CodeMonkey> shoky: I tried it with and without that 2nd remove. I want to remove all rows, then append my newrows back in. This doesn't work either http://jsfiddle.net/vhvX2/14/
[11:02:40] <shoky> oh
[11:03:07] <CodeMonkey> just as a test obviously. If I can get that working, then I can start manipulating the rows
[11:03:35] <Eviltwin> Anyone else willing to run this for me? http://jsperf.com/arguments-vs-multiarg
[11:03:38] <shoky> CodeMonkey:  .add()  just adds elements to a jq collection (e.g. rows)   but it doesn't actually manipulate any DOM element (so it doesnt insert the rows anywhere except in that collection)
[11:03:43] <Eviltwin> Preferably on IEs since I don't have those
[11:03:51] <shoky> Eviltwin sure
[11:05:06] <CodeMonkey> Eviltwin: running in IE 8: Ran ok. You need the test numbers?
[11:05:16] <Eviltwin> CodeMonkey: Should be reported back here automatically
[11:05:21] <CodeMonkey> ah ok
[11:05:24] <CodeMonkey> done then
[11:06:05] <Eviltwin> THanks
[11:06:17] <shoky> and Ie9

[11:12:02] <tw2113> who in the world would have a pool of hot lava readily available?
[11:12:24] <someprimetime> is it possible to track the x-axis (left and right) for the mousewheel event?
[11:12:30] <shoky> uhhh that place in the end of T2 :(
[11:12:31] <CodeMonkey> shoky: It looks like that's detaching them and adding them back in nicely. But how do I remove all the rows before adding the newrows back in?
[11:12:43] <shoky> CodeMonkey: remove ALL ?
[11:13:51] <shoky> CodeMonkey: still not sure what you're trying to achieve..
[11:13:59] <CodeMonkey> shoky: right. Eventually newrows will have the reordered version of the rows. So all rows need detached, or removed in preparation to insert the newrows.
[11:14:16] <shoky> ah
[11:15:55] <shoky> CodeMonkey: so what do you mean how do you remove them and add them back? same as we did here.. just dont exit the each in the middle :P
[11:16:08] <BrotherRodriguez> The question I asked at 10:30 is now on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/q/10821817/994466. The odd behavior is only happening in Chrome, which to me makes it even odder.
[11:16:13] <brettster> thanks guys
[11:16:58] <CodeMonkey> shoky: yeah, I know, eventually they will all be detached so it wont matter
[11:17:11] <pace_t_zulu> hey guys ... is there a way to unbind only certain code from $(window).resize() ?
[11:17:12] <BrotherRodriguez> any js/css/chrome gurus want to take a crack at it?
[11:19:01] <angrywombat> anyone know why a click event for an img wouldnt work in html in the jquery document ready handler?
[11:19:11] <angrywombat> when i paste the click handler directly in firebug it works
[11:19:43] <alfik> lol why jquery has nothing implementet like hide page before dom loads . ?
[11:22:28] <jedimind> holy shit its alextucker
[11:22:46] <alextucker> jedimind, yes it is
[11:23:15] <jedimind> stop slacking off
[11:23:31] <pace_t_zulu> hey guys ... is there a way to unbind only certain code from $(window).resize() ?
[11:23:32] <alextucker> jedimind, compiling
[11:23:56] <jedimind> http://xkcd.com/303/
[11:24:39] <alextucker> jedimind, actually was legit compiling nginx lol
[11:33:11] <johnkpaul-afk> Eviltwin: I get completely different results in chrome 19 and FF 12 on osx lion
[11:33:23] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[11:33:26] <Eviltwin> It's unforutnate
[11:33:28] <johnkpaul> I think that's fairly common though
[11:33:30] <Eviltwin> unfortunate*
[11:33:39] <johnkpaul> cor v8 to have different performance behavior
[11:33:43] <johnkpaul> for*
[11:33:50] <shoky> BrotherRodriguez:
[11:34:05] <someprimetime> yo Eviltwin is it possible to determine left and right on the x-axis for the mousewheel event?
[11:34:08] <someprimetime> i can already detect up and down
[11:34:14] <shoky> BrotherRodriguez: it's fine if you remove position:absolute  from .background class
[11:34:28] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Don't know. Haven't played much with the mousewheel event
[11:34:41] <shoky> BrotherRodriguez: that's causing the body element to be 'non-scrollable' as far as that plugin is concerned
[11:34:41] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: word thanks. just as you responded someone replied to my question on SO
[11:34:47] <someprimetime> they said: event.originalEvent.wheelDeltaX possibly
[11:34:54] <BrotherRodriguez> shoky: let me try that
[11:35:38] <BrotherRodriguez> shoky: it's a miracle!
[11:35:41] <shoky> ;>
[11:36:12] <BrotherRodriguez> I'd love to learn more about that. Do you know any resources related to position: absolute and "scrollability"?
[11:36:17] <amites> Any ideas why a JQuery UI sortable on a table would force the first head column to match the full width of the body columns? screenshot: http://awesomescreenshot.com/0986u8k28 (jsfiddle in a few minutes if not obvious)
[11:37:02] <shoky> BrotherRodriguez: i dont know about it really, i just used the debugger to go into the plugin's code, found that it checks the computed style for all ancestors of the element you wanna scroll to
[11:37:10] <amites> btw: This overrides any custom css I add in through firebug
[11:37:34] <shoky> BrotherRodriguez: and the computed overflow for the 'body' was 'visible' hence the plugin thought that there's no reason to scroll
[11:37:50] <BrotherRodriguez> gotcha
[11:38:08] <shoky> BrotherRodriguez: i just looked at what styles were applied on the 'body' and saw that position:absolute and tried to remove it (cause i didnt find anything changing its overflow)
[11:38:22] <shoky> so position was next to be considered, and it worked ;p
[11:41:16] <tubbo> hi guys
[11:41:25] <tubbo> is there a function for selecting a particular <option> based on its value?
[11:41:30] <tubbo> or do i just set val()?
[11:42:36] <shoky> $('option[value=foo]')
[11:43:28] <ruethewhirled> tubbo: I always just use .val()
[11:43:30] <biffy> I have a document.keyup event, is it possible to get the control ID which handled the keyup event, instead of just the document?
[11:44:05] <shoky> biffy:  either event.target
[11:44:08] <rosieres_respawn> i´ve got a big problem, wich I guess cannot reproduce in a short code. I have the problen, thal all bind() events on line are iterated by two and i have no clue why this is .. . .  don´t blame me for poor coding . . . i´m learning ;-)   http://jsfiddle.net/MLsBR/1/  -> Look where it sais /*show the hoverbox*/
[11:44:28] <shoky> biffy: or if you're using jquery .. then just  this.id
[11:45:09] <johnkpaul> rosieres_respawn: what does "iterated by two" mean
[11:46:09] <rosieres_respawn> johnkpaul: its always done twice : hover , mouse enter, click . . . whatever i want
[11:46:14] <biffy> shoky: i tried that but event.target gives me [object:HTMLInputElement
[11:46:39] <biffy> my function line looks like $(document).bind('keyup', function(evt) { and then its just evt.target
[11:47:06] <shoky> biffy:  come on... event.target.id
[11:47:13] <shoky> and yeah so evt.target.id whatever
[11:47:36] <shoky> wait
[11:47:51] <shoky> you're using .bind  on the document ?
[11:48:07] <johnkpaul> rosieres_respawn: are you calling myImapPositionGenerator() twice?
[11:48:10] <shoky> mmm ok but your event.target seems fine
[11:48:14] <johnkpaul> worst case, unbind the events first
[11:48:54] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: something like $(this).unbind('click mouseenter mouseleave').bind({})
[11:48:59] <johnkpaul> sorry, not someprimetime, ^^ rosieres_respawn
[11:49:25] <shoky> or better yet use an event namespace
[11:49:42] <shoky> $(this).unbind('mystuff').bind({
[11:49:42] <shoky>                     'click.mystuff' : function() {
[11:49:44] <shoky> etc..
[11:49:59] <amites> Any ideas why jQuery UI sortable makes the 1st column of a table head the full width of the body table?? http://jsfiddle.net/amites/Ac8sA/ <--- semi-functional but displays the bug
[11:50:35] <biffy> thank you shoky
[11:50:40] <Keir__> if i have json object full of html nodes and i iterate through the object with .each will v.nodeName be the type of the element?
[11:51:06] <shoky> Keir__: that depends on what your json object looks like..
[11:51:11] <amites> Keir__: try it and use console.llog(v.nodeName)
[11:51:37] <shoky> also it's not a json object once its an.. object
[11:51:40] <amites> ** console.log(v.nodeName)
[11:51:41] <rosieres_respawn> johnkpaul: whats not someprimetime ?? :-)
[11:52:12] <johnkpaul> amites: th has different styles than td I'd guess
[11:57:28] <rosieres_respawn> johnkpaul: now i got it . . . someprimetime is a username --haha  . . .btw. it works !!! --- Thank you sooo much !!! you´re the man !!
[11:57:53] <johnkpaul> ha, I thought you were being sarcastic earlier ;) you're welcome, have fun
[11:58:24] <amites> johnkpaul: if I change the style for that first head column in firebug the width remains the same even setting width: 20px !important;  also doesn't display that way without the sortable
[11:59:38] <johnkpaul> amites: change the style or the tag?
[12:04:03] <amites> johnkpaul: tried both
[12:07:30] <amites> This version displays the whole thing (working drag n drop) http://jsfiddle.net/amites/Ac8sA/5/
[12:09:32] <mansour> I have a quick question. I am submitting a form with ajax : $("#contact-us").submit(function(event){ .....
[12:09:57] <mansour> now I need to add validation before submit, I checked this tut http://corpocrat.com/2009/07/15/quick-easy-form-validation-tutorial-with-jquery/
[12:10:24] <mansour> which not very detailed. I just need to add this line $("#contact-us").validate();
[12:10:33] <mansour> where do I put it ??
[12:10:50] <mansour> do I need to modify the .validate() ??
[12:10:56] <teolicy> (parrot from #javascript): Hi. Suppose I have url (absolute or relative, I don't know) foo. Is there a sane way to check whether foo is same origin as window.location, or must I think about the edgecases myself and write my own ugly set of indexOf()s/regexes?
[12:11:04] <mansour> all I need is to add a validation before submit.
[12:15:13] <angrywombat> i'm having trouble getting images with a certain class to register a click event.. the images themselves are populated after page load thru ajax.. i copied the output for one and put it in the HTML source and that click event works
[12:15:17] <angrywombat> anyone know what gives?
[12:15:22] <amites> johnkpaul: you were right about the style -- was float:left; added to tobody -- was looking in wrong place
[12:16:40] <johnkpaul> ah ok, glad it worked out amites
[12:16:45] <chasem> how can I communicate (add a click function) to all of the a tags in a modal popup?
[12:17:07] <johnkpaul> angrywombat: are you sure you're adding the event after the element is added to the dom
[12:17:34] <angrywombat> johnkpaul: no, it's not and that's what i figured is causing the issue (which is why i added the static test image to the source)
[12:17:47] <angrywombat> is there any way around it? the click event is registered in document ready
[12:18:03] <johnkpaul> ?on @angrywombat
[12:18:04] <bot-t> angrywombat, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:18:13] <johnkpaul> look into the live binding, angrywombat
[12:18:21] <angrywombat> johnkpaul: sweet, thank you
[12:18:44] <johnkpaul> no problem, angrywombat
[12:19:02] <saml> hey, in jquery, how can I web scale?
[12:19:10] <johnkpaul> chasem: what do you mean? you want to bind a click handler to the modal popup?
[12:19:38] <saml> i mean.. someone registered .on('blur', f)   and i'm using jquery ui..  and on dropdown select event  fires blur
[12:19:47] <saml> can I prevent blur event temporarily?
[12:23:41] <chasem> @johnkpaul, exactly
[12:23:49] <chasem> I've tried the usual with live, but it's not having any effect
[12:24:03] <johnkpaul> $('#modal-container').click(function(){})
[12:24:14] <chasem> exactly
[12:24:25] <angrywombat> does the on event need to be anywhere in particular in the source? like document ready
[12:24:27] <chasem> the real issue that we are using onbeforeunload in the main document
[12:24:43] <chasem> and so we have fired code to add click functionality to all the links
[12:24:49] <chasem> basically sets a variable
[12:25:00] <chasem> everything works fine until the modal pops up
[12:25:02] <chasem> there the code fails
[12:25:17] <chasem> it's a crappy solution, we know. but we don't have many options
[12:25:43] <chasem> we can't seem to communicate with the modal dialog
[12:26:15] <saml> how can I mute bind event?
[12:26:33] <saml> i mean blur event
[12:26:36] <johnkpaul> angrywombat: if you're using it to bind events on elements that are currently in the dom, yes, they need to be in document.ready
[12:26:46] <johnkpaul> saml: I don't believe that there is a straightforward way to do what you're trying to do
[12:26:59] <saml> i see. thanks.
[12:27:08] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ chasem
[12:27:24] <saml> not sure why this monkey registered doPOSTtoServerToSaveStuff  on blur event
[12:27:32] <saml> what's so hard about Save button?
[12:28:14] <Keir__> can anyone please tell me why deals[i].node is undefined in this paste please? http://pastebin.com/iVBL1Srh
[12:29:32] <johnkpaul> saml: if you have a reference to the function, why not unbind and rebind?
[12:30:03] <saml> so, on select, unbind, change fields,  rebind, and fire blur  to save the form
[12:30:04] <johnkpaul> Keir__: because deals is never defined
[12:30:21] <johnkpaul> saml: if that's the only way
[12:30:25] <Keir__> sorry that paste is incomplete
[12:30:35] <saml> on select, can i not fire blur event?
[12:30:36] <Keir__> deals is defined further up as deals = new Array();
[12:31:07] <ngharo> Keir__: deals[i][node]
[12:31:19] <johnkpaul> oh, well then it's because sigleDeal has no property named 'node'
[12:31:44] <Keir__> node is defined in the each loop
[12:31:48] <Keir__> i'll try that ngharo thanks
[12:32:59] <Keir__> hmm still getting undefined
[12:34:04] <Keir__> if i click on the undefined error in firebug i get this line though, which is what is throwing me singleNode = [input.g3]
[12:34:14] <evlh> i like how i got assorted munchkins from dd's this morning, and the assortion was all that of 3 types. :|
[12:34:28] <evlh> </dailygripe>
[12:34:29] <shoky> Keir__: why are you $.extend()ing  singleDeal ?
[12:35:08] <Keir__> so that i can clone the object
[12:35:12] <jeffsmykil> does fadeIn() have a callback?
[12:35:34] <shoky> Keir__: well, singleDeal doesn't have a node property
[12:35:49] <shoky> hence undefined..
[12:36:01] <shoky> ah sorry you changed to [node]
[12:36:13] <jeffsmykil> excellent it does
[12:37:02] <Carlitta87> how do i set a background image to only auto-resize the width of the image
[12:37:42] <shoky> Keir__:  node is a jquery object
[12:37:59] <Keir__> can you see what im trying to do with the script?
[12:38:02] <shoky> Keir__: so you can't do deals[i][node]  and expect anything..
[12:38:14] <Keir__> i've changed node now to singleNode incase it was a name issue
[12:38:30] <Carlitta87> how do i set a background image to only auto-resize the width of the image? missed question mark...sorry
[12:39:03] <shoky> Keir__: its not a name issue. i told you what the issue is
[12:39:10] <Keir__> depending on the number of selectiongs that are made i'm trying to clone the object, and in each object add name attributes to the inputs which have a value of the key in the object
[12:39:15] <Keir__> sorry can you repeat it please
[12:39:25] <shoky> Keir__: you want deals[i][key]  i believe
[12:39:35] <shoky> key is the string, not node..
[12:40:53] <shoky> and since you asked to repeat the issue: <shoky> Keir__:  node is a jquery object   <shoky> Keir__: so you can't do deals[i][node]
[12:41:51] <Keir__> i tried changing it to deals[i][key] and it sort of worked, except each input in each object in deals has the same number >.<
[12:42:08] <shoky> yeah that's the closure issue
[12:42:12] <shoky> before the $.each
[12:42:20] <shoky> uhm
[12:42:30] <shoky> best if you just
[12:43:06] <Keir__> i can create the object each time in a single each and add the index that way, would that be better?
[12:43:52] <shoky> hmm
[12:44:33] <shoky> donno what youre doing there sry ;)
[12:44:40] * shoky hides
[12:45:14] <shoky> and wtf i see you're already using 'i'  somewhere before the pasted code... ;)
[12:45:55] <Keir__> trying to insert chunks of html based on the number thats selected from a select, but each html chunk contains inputs that i need to name="example[index][value]"
[12:46:41] <Keir__> and i'm not using i before the pasted code, i've just changed my code to try and not have to recreate the object within the each loop but forgot to take out that initial 'i' that you're seeing
[12:46:47] <shoky> i dont see why, for each of the 6 objects in singleDeal, you clone the whole singleDeal
[12:46:51] <shoky> and you do all of that, 3 times
[12:47:22] <shoky> you sure you mean to clone that singleDeal thing 18 times ?
[12:47:56] <shoky> and btw, doing $.extend won't create new jquery objects for you...
[12:48:22] <Keir__> i don't clone singleDeal 18 times
[12:48:29] <shoky> all of those clones will be referencing the original 6 jq objects in singleDeal........
[12:49:04] <shoky> no idea dude
[12:50:00] <Keir__> how would you approach what im trying to do, if you dont mind me asking
[12:50:08] <shoky> i dont know what you're trying to do
[12:50:12] <johnkpaul> Keir__: I don't think we really understand what you're trying to do
[12:51:07] <Keir__> i have a select on the page, when a number is selected it creates a chunk of html which is a div containing a header, 3 inputs and a link
[12:51:46] <Keir__> but i need the name attr of the inputs to be like this name="blah[index][value]"
[12:51:52] <alfik> shoky when i put direct to css display:none how i can make then the fadein and remove the display none cuz this is not working $('body').fadeIn('slow' , function() {       ? can you help me ? :(
[12:52:11] <quizme> if you're making 2 $.getJSON calls, JSON call A and JSON call B, and if you need the data from JSON call A in JSON call B, then how do you guarantee that JSON call A returns *before* JSON call B does?
[12:52:11] <Keir__> i'll show you something that works from a different angle gimme asec :P
[12:52:40] <shoky> alfik: it should work i think..
[12:53:04] <shoky> quizme: call the 2nd getJSON from inside the callback of the first
[12:54:02] <brettster> does anyone see anythjing wrong with this
[12:54:02] <brettster> 		$('ul').find('li a:eq(1)').addClass('sResources');	
[12:54:08] <brettster> it's not adding my script anywhere?
[12:54:17] <brettster> im sorry - my class
[12:54:34] <quizme> shoky, but that's so slow
[12:54:48] <quizme> shoky, i want to call them at the same time.
[12:55:01] <shoky> huh.
[12:55:13] <Keir__> this replicates what i want to achieve :P
[12:55:17] <Keir__> http://pastebin.com/cD4LpCxc
[12:55:47] <quizme> shoky sometimes it takes 1 second to get a response from these services
[12:55:59] <quizme> shoky if i string them together that's 2 seconds
[12:56:44] <Keir__> however there's 3 different possible values for attr('data-dealtype') which would mean replicating virtually the same code 3 times
[12:57:23] <shoky> quizme:   var a = $.getJSON(url), b = $.getJSON(url2);    b.done( function() { a.done( function() { ... stuff ... } ) } );
[12:58:04] <shoky> well those functions should be function(data)  i suppose
[12:58:34] <quizme> shoky: i don't understand
[12:58:55] <Carlitta87> hey...
[12:58:56] <shoky> well im not sure i understand what you're after so.. join the club
[12:59:01] <Carlitta87> lol
[12:59:11] <shoky> helo carlitta
[12:59:39] <hlvewentcrazy> what club?
[12:59:39] <Carlitta87> quizme : repost ques
[12:59:48] <hlvewentcrazy> I'd be in any club shoky is in
[12:59:59] <shoky> then read quizme's question(s) ;)
[13:00:08] <quizme> i'm making 2 json calls
[13:00:08] <shoky> or my answer, i guess ;D
[13:00:19] <quizme> the 2nd call depends on the results of the 1st
[13:00:28] <shoky> quizme: that's not precise enough
[13:00:37] <shoky> what is it about the 2nd call that depends on the results of the 1st?
[13:00:41] <quizme> but netowork latency returns stuff at different times
[13:00:52] <rosieres> johnkpaul: i´ve extnded the script to catch parameters . . . i do set a focus() or trigger a click . . . unfortunately if I push a parameter that triggers a click the click is done several times . . . could you give me a hint ? http://jsfiddle.net/MLsBR/2/ -> at the bottom
[13:01:01] <quizme> how do i guarantee that the data from the 1st call is available in the 2nd call
[13:01:13] <quizme> but i don't want to make the calls in serial, cuz that's too slow
[13:01:29] <quizme> i want them to be made in parallel, and then have the 2nd call just wait until the 1st call is done.
[13:01:53] <johnkpaul> rosieres: .trigger('click') or .focus()
[13:02:22] <shoky> quizme:  so you want both of them to be responded and only then ACT
[13:02:47] <quizme> yes
[13:03:22] <shoky> quizme:  var a = $.getJSON(url1), b = $.getJSON(url2);   $.when(a,b).then( function(dataFromA, dataFromB) { ... stuff ... } )
[13:03:24] <rosieres> johnkpaul: I think I need both ?! - focus shows tooltip klick shows box with info .. . am I wrong ?
[13:03:49] <johnkpaul> rosieres: I don't know, try it and see
[13:03:54] <quizme> oh cool i didn't know about $.when
[13:04:09] <shoky> there's always a first time ;P welcome to another club
[13:04:30] <quizme> shoky thnx
[13:04:33] <shoky> $.when and deferred.pipe() are awesome
[13:04:38] <shoky> np
[13:05:13] <Carlitta87> ok...on my last straw ...not sure way to do i have a background slider and i would like it to stretch horizontally ONLY, height shut be set...how can i do this?
[13:05:18] <rodd> indeed
[13:05:19] <alfik> shoky k im using the callcss.js when javascript is enabled it call a .css where my body is display none so its working good now .. but look when you load my page on http://fresharea.net/       IE it works but it create black background at a short period .. why this is doing ... this IE sux really ..
[13:05:22] <rodd> im still reading about it
[13:05:47] <rodd> hard to get a free time to take a peek at it
[13:05:53] <mantas322> Hi
[13:06:53] <shoky> Carlitta87: didnt understand half of what you said, but.. you want to change the width ?
[13:06:59] <rosieres> johnkpaul: the problem also appears if I only take the click @ typeof mo ===       @If I take only the focus all is fine . . .
[13:07:07] <mantas322> noobie jquery question
[13:07:18] <mantas322> I have a javascript data object right
[13:07:23] <mantas322> in json or whatever
[13:07:30] <shoky> which?
[13:07:31] <mantas322> now I want to pass it over to another page
[13:08:15] <mantas322> hello?
[13:08:19] <shoky> helo
[13:08:29] <mantas322> i dont know if my question makes sense
[13:08:38] <shoky> you haven't asked one yet
[13:08:55] <mantas322> how can I send a data object from one page to another?
[13:09:22] <shoky> localstorage/cookie/serverside stuff
[13:09:35] <mantas322> serverside
[13:09:40] <shoky> maybe i missed an option
[13:09:42] <mantas322> asp.net or coldfusion
[13:10:05] <shoky> then you can pass GET/POST parameters to the other page
[13:10:43] <mantas322> okay okay
[13:10:46] <mantas322> I think that helped
[13:11:06] <shoky> JSON.stringify( jsObj )  to turn a js obj into a JSON string
[13:11:15] <shoky> you can send that string to the server
[13:12:34] <Carlitta87> shoky : lol ok... i have a background slider. I would like ONLY the width to resize depending on the width of the browser
[13:13:21] <hlvewentcrazy> easy, actually.
[13:13:21] <rosieres> johnkpaul: I was *rrrroooonnngggg ! I have overytime a parameter is pushed several calls to all elses . . . mhh  dunno what to do with these if clauses . . .
[13:13:22] <hlvewentcrazy> :3
[13:15:08] <shoky> Carlitta87: oks so you can  $(window).resize( ... )
[13:16:04] <acalbaza> hi, is it possible to change the contentType when making an ajax get request using jsonp?  i'd like to set the contentType to something other than application/json if possible.
[13:16:55] <thinkt4nk> the service that provides the response sets the content type
[13:17:37] <acalbaza> the client can also ask for a content type
[13:18:03] <thinkt4nk> for the particular service you're asking about?
[13:19:07] <innociv_> I'm behind on the jquery updates.  Have they added something yet that's the equivalent to .live() but for when elements are created?   Like, whenever an element that matches a selector is added to a page, I want to do something.
[13:19:49] <acalbaza> here is my jsonp call... http://pastebin.com/Mdh18VMY
[13:20:53] <thinkt4nk> acalbaza contentType is the request content type, not the response content type
[13:21:04] <acalbaza> my service is set up to accept the content type provided...
[13:21:27] <thinkt4nk> ok, well pass it however you have it supported, likely as a get parameter
[13:21:47] <thinkt4nk> what are you asking?
[13:21:58] <acalbaza> but it always flips to application/json in the request... no matter what i specify in contentType for the request
[13:25:31] <johnkpaul> acalbaza: I don't think that script tags have any paticular Accept content type
[13:26:04] <johnkpaul> I think your backend is reporting incorrectly if you are saying that it is recieving an http request with Accept:application/json
[13:26:07] <acalbaza> ya, i think you are correct
[13:26:09] <thinkt4nk> specifying any contentType in ajax() will not change the response content type
[13:26:11] <tubbo> acalbaza: the response type IS the request type. if you request JSON you're gonna get JSON back...
[13:26:34] <tubbo> acalbaza: the dataType is what you want the response type to be
[13:26:39] <acalbaza> there is a different behavior b/w localhost and a remote server
[13:26:47] <acalbaza> i CAN specify contentType using localhost
[13:26:51] <thinkt4nk> no, the dataType doesn't alter the response content type header, either
[13:27:24] * tubbo would also recommend not executing code requested from a remote server, rather, execute the JS in the success callback of the ajax call using the data obtained from the ajax call
[13:27:48] <tubbo> this problem would be moot if you followed those semantics
[13:28:05] <thinkt4nk> that won't work with cross domain
[13:28:19] <thinkt4nk> that's why he's using jsonp
[13:28:19] <tubbo> thinkt4nk: jsonp works across domains
[13:28:33] <tubbo> yes, and jsonp at the end of the day returns JSON
[13:28:37] <johnkpaul> jsonp works by inserting a script tag
[13:28:42] <innociv_> lmao
[13:28:45] <johnkpaul> no, tubbo, it doesn't, it returns text/javascript
[13:28:46] <Carlitta87> shoky: still here?
[13:28:47] <thinkt4nk> oh, I misunderstood your note
[13:28:49] <innociv_> The livequery site is dead. What should I do?
[13:28:50] <thinkt4nk> my mistake
[13:28:52] <innociv_> Or use in its place?
[13:28:59] <johnkpaul> ?on @ innociv_
[13:29:14] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.on @ innociv_
[13:29:17] <innociv_> Doesn't work for calling a function on element creation?
[13:29:24] <innociv_> Or I missed something
[13:29:26] <tubbo> johnkpaul: i never said it returned as application/json, i just said it returns JSON
[13:29:26] <thinkt4nk> but jsonp executes the code in the response, which is just a call to a function that you specify
[13:29:32] <johnkpaul> tubbo: no, it doesn't
[13:29:36] <johnkpaul> it returns javascript
[13:29:38] <tubbo> lol ok
[13:29:44] <tubbo> and the javascript function returns JSON
[13:30:05] <johnkpaul> no, the javascript calls a function with an javascript object as the parameter
[13:30:06] <thinkt4nk> johnkpaul is right
[13:30:13] <innociv_> http://api.jquery.com/on/ Requests event to be passed, and there is no "create" event.
[13:30:16] <johnkpaul> innociv_: "on element creation"?
[13:30:25] <johnkpaul> oh, you want to be notified when a new element is inserted into the dom, innociv_?
[13:30:27] <tubbo> i'm not into arguing with you right now but my point remains
[13:30:36] <johnkpaul> I don't believe there is any way to do that in a cross browser way
[13:30:37] <innociv_> Yes, that matches a selector
[13:30:42] <johnkpaul> FF has a "dom modification event"
[13:30:45] <tubbo> johnkpaul: there definitely is, i've done it many times
[13:30:50] <shoky> Carlitta87: yea
[13:30:54] <innociv_> livequery did it. But it's 2 years old, jquery 1.4.  Not sure how well it works..
[13:31:13] <johnkpaul> livequery didn't do that
[13:31:17] <thinkt4nk> tubbo what are you talking about?  I think johnkpaul is talking about the element load event
[13:31:32] <tubbo> JSONP is just how you get the data, then you plop your JS code in the ajax:success callback
[13:31:38] <tubbo> that is what i'm talking about :D
[13:31:45] <phpkiddy123> $(document).ready(function(){
[13:31:46] <phpkiddy123>   $('img#captchaimage').die().live('click', function(){
[13:31:46] <phpkiddy123>     $(this).attr('src', '/captcha.php');
[13:31:46] <phpkiddy123>   });
[13:31:46] <phpkiddy123> });
[13:31:55] <phpkiddy123> the above code does not work in firefox
[13:31:56] <johnkpaul> innociv_: livequery allowed you to add events to elements that were added to the dom int eh future
[13:32:00] <thinkt4nk> lmao
[13:32:07] <johnkpaul> livequery did not do that by checking when a new element was inserted, and adding the event handler
[13:32:18] <phpkiddy123> but if i change the img src's extension an image format's extension like .jpg or .png it does work in firefox
[13:32:19] <johnkpaul> it did that by attaching the event handler higher up the dom and letting the event bubble
[13:32:21] <phpkiddy123> any ideas?
[13:32:27] <Faryshta> How do I use #target on jquery? I mean urls like www.example.com/#element
[13:32:40] <innociv_> johnkpaul, no?..  You didn't have to pass an event. If you did, you could call a function on it on creation or destruction
[13:32:42] <johnkpaul> Faryshta: that's nothing to do with jquery, just have an element in your page with that id
[13:33:17] <Faryshta> johnkpaul: but I need that jquery can recognize that element. To trigger some sort of event when that element is targetted.
[13:33:28] <johnkpaul> Faryshta: look into the jquery bbq plugin
[13:33:43] <johnkpaul> innociv_: I actually don't remember, I would like to know though
[13:33:47] <johnkpaul> I've never used it for that purpose
[13:34:03] <innociv_> https://github.com/brandonaaron/livequery right above "API"
[13:34:11] <acalbaza1> ok, so i can understand that script doesnt send a content type... but i dont understand why i see different behavior locally than i do remotely
[13:34:26] <innociv_> Hopefully it works in 1.7.2 i guess i'll see.
[13:35:12] <johnkpaul> innociv_: it just checks in a settimeout loop
[13:35:29] <johnkpaul> and has some cache it checks against
[13:35:31] <innociv_> Nope.  Doesn't work.
[13:35:37] <innociv_> Just makes an eval error
[13:36:29] <innociv_> Oh nevermind, was missing a ; on something
[13:36:51] <tubbo> phpkiddy123: don't paste. use gist.github.com
[13:36:52] <Faryshta> Problem solved thanks to johnkpaul http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[13:37:10] <johnkpaul> awesome Faryshta
[13:47:12] <FrankieShakes> hey. how's everyone doing?
[13:47:27] <phpkiddy123> good
[13:47:49] <hlvewentcrazy> lame day here
[13:47:55] <hlvewentcrazy> I hate meetings
[13:48:07] <tubbo> meetings are a colossal time waste
[13:48:12] <phpkiddy123> cold evening here , brrrr
[13:48:34] <FrankieShakes> I've been banging my head around an issue all day and am having no luck. I'm trying to figure out why a "mouseenter" handler is _never_ called when dragging an item onto the element who's listening for the "mouseenter" event.  Oh... and this is only in IE8!!
[13:48:43] <thinkt4nk> meetings are toxic http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Meetings_Are_Toxic.php
[13:48:49] <phpkiddy123> yeaa, real meetings are better suited for taking place on mirc :)
[13:48:57] <FrankieShakes> We're using jQuery UI's draggable util... not sure if that helps things.
[13:49:07] <tubbo> even those are annoying
[13:49:14] <FrankieShakes> Has anybody run into this issue before? I can't for the life of me figure this one out
[13:49:18] <tubbo> conference calls? please
[13:49:20] <z0ned> how do i convert a keycode (event.which) to its corresponding character?
[13:49:47] <tubbo> i can get 4 kids with downs syndrome to play the beatles faster than i can figure out what to do after a conf call
[13:49:50] <hlvewentcrazy> no no
[13:50:01] <hlvewentcrazy> stupid in person meetings
[13:50:02] <hlvewentcrazy> waste of time
[13:50:03] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[13:50:05] <thinkt4nk> z0ned  see the key codes on lines 27 through 48 here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js
[13:50:18] <tubbo> hlvewentcrazy: right i understand that, i was saying that additionally, conf calls/online meetings aren't much better
[13:50:20] <phpkiddy123> i allways found the audio quality to be so poor on converence calls :/
[13:50:26] <thinkt4nk> z0ned keycodes have integer values
[13:50:34] <tubbo> phpkiddy123: the phone transmits at ~24kbps i believe
[13:50:43] <tubbo> iTunes songs are 256kbps, for comparison
[13:50:45] <tubbo> :D
[13:51:43] <z0ned> thinkt4nk, i have an array of alphabet characters and numbers. when the user presses a key, i'm trying to write a function to determine if the key is in the array or not
[13:52:39] <thinkt4nk> z0ned ok, so if ($.inArray(keycode, keycodes_to_match) > -1)
[13:52:40] <saml> hey, i am too lazy to try and see.. but  $(foo).on('blur', f);   $(foo).on('blur', f);    would fire f twice on blur?
[13:52:54] <tubbo> saml: that will crash your browser
[13:53:08] <saml> Ctrl+Alt+Del?
[13:53:09] <z0ned> thinkt4nk, i don't have an array of keycodes to match. i have an array of standard alphabet characters and integers
[13:53:15] <tubbo> saml: try `rm -rf *` in the terminal
[13:53:18] <rosieres> johnkpaul: won´t believe it . . . my function was just in wrong place . . . problem solved . . .
[13:53:19] <tubbo> should work 4 ya
[13:53:21] <tubbo> ;D
[13:53:30] <saml> crap i was root
[13:53:30] <shoky> z0ned:  'a'.charCodeAt(0)  gives you the keycode
[13:53:32] <shoky> for 'a'
[13:53:38] <z0ned> ahhh ok
[13:53:39] <tubbo> saml: hah
[13:53:59] <tubbo> saml: to answer your particularly lazy question which could have already been answered by now, on some browsers yes.
[13:54:04] <saml> you don't know on ton of your head?
[13:54:06] <z0ned> shoky, is A different than a
[13:54:08] <tubbo> nope
[13:54:14] <shoky> z0ned: check for yourself :)
[13:54:15] <saml> tubbo, how? give me short testcase
[13:54:18] <saml> oh
[13:54:20] <saml> console!
[13:54:23] <tubbo> saml: yeah...
[13:54:25] <tubbo> lol
[13:55:28] <tubbo> saml: i believe the early IEs will execute that twice
[13:55:32] <tubbo> but the newer browsers won't
[13:55:33] <saml> oh yah f gets called twice
[13:55:39] <tubbo> oh good then
[13:55:39] <tubbo> :D
[13:55:42] <saml> chrome executes twice, too
[13:55:49] <saml> chrome is rootkit by google
[13:56:36] <tubbo> what lol
[14:01:18] <tubbo> i guess facebook is rootkit by the CIA then
[14:01:23] <tubbo> :tinfoil:
[14:05:48] <ill1cit> im trying to access data from a loop in this format in a alert(dump(var)) key => string
[14:06:09] <ill1cit> socket.emit('news', { hello: img });
[14:07:23] <ill1cit> nevermind
[14:07:25] <ill1cit> figured it out
[14:07:52] <Conic> hi all, can someon tell me why the selector here does not get reognized? html.on('click', '*:not(#notThisElement *)', function(e) { ...
[14:08:05] <rodd> I must be missing something with deferreds in a loop..
[14:08:34] <Conic> i tried it with and without both of the stars
[14:09:07] <Conic> what i want to achieve is that it listens on every element except the ones inside of #notThisElement
[14:11:17] <ill1cit> lol this is what i was working on
[14:11:18] <ill1cit> http://gethosted.co.za:8004/
[14:14:09] <Conic> ill1cit: thanks for the link but my chrome can't open it is busy blocking an endless amount of social plugins as it seems :D
[14:15:15] <ill1cit> it just shows the profile pic of the last person who posted something on twitter
[14:15:47] <Conic> was your post a response to my question?
[14:19:01] <MeatCake> I'm trying to submit a form using ajax but I want it to behave like a normal form submit. By that I mean actually refresh the page and send all my json serialized data to the appropriate route. Is this possible, and if so is it bad form to do so?
[14:19:36] <NoiseEee> MeatCake: why xkr/ajax at all?
[14:20:32] <MeatCake> NoiseEee: Well the only reason I want to use ajaz is because I have data that I want to serialize to json. If I can do this using a normal form submit I would be glad to do that. Is that possible?
[14:21:38] <NoiseEee> meh, might be easier to do xhr, you'd do the redirect after the success response was received
[14:22:53] <Conic> can someon tell me why this selector < *:not(#notThisElement *) > does not work in an .on() function ?
[14:25:35] <krz> whats wrong with this: http://pastie.org/3997829

[14:26:46] <krz> the fuck
[14:26:51] <krz> thats not even the issue
[14:27:06] <krz> and :eq() is a selector
[14:27:14] <krz> .eq() is a method
[14:29:50] <srj55> I want to execute 2 .css() statements in sequence.  how should I do that?
[14:30:24] <krz> srj55: chain them
[14:30:25] <krz> duh
[14:32:22] <srj55> krz:  I 'm running:   $('#layer1').css('z-index',1)    and then $('#layer2').css('z-index',999) .... but they appear to run in parallel.
[14:32:56] <innociv_> The first line will run first.
[14:34:08] <wojciech_fornal> hi
[14:34:42] <srj55> innociv_: alright, thanks
[14:34:46] <wojciech_fornal> is there a way (through e-mail, rss or whatever except revisiting a site) to get info on updates to the jQuery API and Docs?
[14:35:26] <chrickso> hi guys, i'm using this scrollTop code with an accordion where i want it to scroll the newly opened menu to the top. it works good except its sending me to the location new menu when the old menu was opened
[14:35:42] <chrickso> how can i tell it to 'close old menu, recalc position, then go'?
[14:49:06] <zackiv31> is there anything equivalent to .on() or .delegate() in 1.3.2 ?
[14:50:04] <fsd> .live() might be your best bet
[14:51:33] <rodd> shoky, hitting my head w/ deferred
[14:51:35] <fsd> but why would you use 1.3.2 with all the performance improvements in newer versions?
[14:51:57] <rodd> but I guess my loop is what's messed up
[14:52:17] <Triex> Does jQuery ever get easy?
[14:52:26] <Triex> It seems so frustrating so far :<
[14:52:38] <fsd> once you get the hang of it, its easy as pie
[14:52:46] <fsd> just takes a little while
[14:52:51] <Triex> Ah >.<
[14:53:00] <Triex> I'm failing at a test I'm tying
[14:53:02] <Triex> trying*
[14:53:08] <zackiv31> haven't had a chance to regression test 1.7 on corporate
[14:53:41] <Triex> I've been trying for like the last 7 hours
[14:53:43] <Triex> and just breaking things constantly
[14:53:54] <Triex> And... it's mega simple
[14:53:55] <fsd> zackiv, even 1.4 was a huge improvement over 1.3 and i think you can use delegate with that
[14:54:17] <shoky> rodd sup
[14:54:51] <shoky> Triex: we can halp
[14:54:56] <rodd> shoky,  Hm hold on, I think the problem isn't pipe
[14:55:14] <fsd> what kind of test are you trying to run tried?
[14:55:20] <fsd> triex*
[14:55:21] <Triex> But it's full of issues I can't explain without giving you the files and such.. Unless you wanna do that, haha
[14:55:28] <Triex> Naw it's a test someone else wrote
[14:55:45] <Triex> I'm trying to do the questions, it's seemingly pretty simple.. But I am failing horribly
[14:55:55] <shoky> well you only have to isolate one of the issues and ask about it seperately from the rest
[14:56:08] <shoky> and take it step by step..

[15:11:16] <Escherial> hello; anyone know of a nice string substitution function for js somewhere?
[15:11:40] <Escherial> something like sprintf("%s %s %s", 12, 15, 19) that returns "12 15 19"
[15:12:04] <Escherial> doing concatenation with pluses is difficult to read...i know i could write a function to do this quickly, but it'd be nice if there was one already out there
[15:16:57] <Danielpk> How i can test if mouse is inside of element?
[15:17:45] <nobitanobi> Which event should I use to see if an input has a value? So if I write 'a' in the input, that event should be triggered?
[15:18:18] <Escherial> nobitanobi: you can trap the change() event and do a quick check at the beginning to see if $(this).val() != "" or somesuch
[15:18:41] <nobitanobi> weird, I tried change, but it seems is not being triggered when I insert text.
[15:19:09] <Escherial> are you inserting text by typing into the box or are you doing it programmatically?
[15:19:14] <nobitanobi> typing into the box
[15:19:29] <nobitanobi> tried with click and it works, so the element is there...
[15:23:42] <shoky> nobitanobi:  keydown/keyup/keypress
[15:23:46] <nobitanobi> oh, change works if I write something and I type rewturn
[15:24:02] <Escherial> nobitanobi: yeah, it's fired when the element loses focus, i believe
[15:24:25] <shoky> change fires when it's changed
[15:24:53] <Escherial> right, but it's not fired for each keystroke, i mean
[15:25:06] <felipe_Brz> hi could anyone tell me why this doesn't seem to work on IE 9? http://pastie.org/3998141
[15:25:23] <felipe_Brz> the first function throws out an error on every browser, except for IE
[15:25:34] <felipe_Brz> (i want it to throw up an error, that's me testing)
[15:25:55] <shoky> felipe_Brz: because you have trailing commas in your objects, maybe
[15:25:56] <felipe_Brz> the second fucntion works on all browsers but IE 9
[15:26:00] <shoky> IE doesn't like those
[15:26:05] <blindMoe> felipe_Brz: get rid of the last commas
[15:26:10] <blindMoe> IE doesn't play nicely with them
[15:26:15] <shoky> ;]
[15:26:21] <blindMoe> ahh shaky beat me to it
[15:26:23] <felipe_Brz> blindMoe:  hey
[15:26:25] <blindMoe> err shoky ;)
[15:26:28] <felipe_Brz> blindMoe:  i know you hehe
[15:26:31] * shoky shakes
[15:26:31] <felipe_Brz> from Yii
[15:26:40] <blindMoe> felipe_Brz: yes you do :)
[15:26:45] <felipe_Brz> thanks shoky blindMoe
[15:26:49] <blindMoe> np
[15:27:23] <nobitanobi> Escherial thanks
[15:27:47] <Triex> Do you guys have any favourite resources to learn from?
[15:27:56] <Triex> Or good ones for basic stuff :3
[15:28:09] <blindMoe> Triex: I actually use the API docs to answer most questions
[15:28:57] <Triex> Hmm
[15:33:26] <felipe_Brz> ok I've removed the offending trailing commas... and now IE 9 correctly informs me a 404 for the first function but the other one doesn't get sent at all. http://pastie.org/3998179 ..
[15:33:44] <blindMoe> there is no url specified for the second in the first example you pasted
[15:33:52] <felipe_Brz> i know
[15:33:55] <blindMoe> there isn't in the second either ;)
[15:34:02] <blindMoe> what are you expecting to happen?
[15:34:15] <felipe_Brz> what happens in every browser but ie
[15:34:26] <felipe_Brz> an ajax request gets sent to the current page
[15:34:29] <blindMoe> haha you are surprised that IE does something different? ;)
[15:34:36] <felipe_Brz> yes kind of
[15:34:47] <felipe_Brz> so IE does not like empty post urls?
[15:35:08] <blindMoe> I don't know from experience but it seems so
[15:35:21] <felipe_Brz> is there any other way to tell it to cal the current page?
[15:35:39] <felipe_Brz> because as a yii user you know that the page we're at is determined by the get params and stuff
[15:35:59] <felipe_Brz> so I generally want to send an ajax request to the current page
[15:36:10] <felipe_Brz> i can't see other way to do what without being too mesy
[15:36:24] <felipe_Brz> like setting a custom atrribute on the server side with the current url
[15:36:33] <felipe_Brz> then fetching it with jquery
[15:36:40] <blindMoe> use Yii to get the current URI
[15:38:09] <felipe_Brz> blindMoe:  ok but in the JS file, how to I put that into the $.post call?
[15:38:26] <blindMoe> felipe_Brz: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11023
[15:38:55] <blindMoe> location.href
[15:40:23] <felipe_Brz> thanks ! blindMoe
[15:40:29] <blindMoe> $5
[15:40:35] <blindMoe> ;)
[15:40:37] <shoky> Triex:  http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[15:40:42] <felipe_Brz> minus $1 because you've learnt something too!
[15:40:47] <shoky> Triex:  and as bot-t likes to say: First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:41:33] <Triex> thanks shoky, haha
[15:41:35] <felipe_Brz> i've been developing my webapp on Yii for the last months and now it's gone production testing so i'm forced to adapt my app so ppl who still use IE can view it
[15:41:36] <Triex> I am planning on it
[15:41:50] <Triex> I just wanted to finish that test first :<
[15:42:10] <shoky> yea but that tests requires you to already know jquery and to be able to use various jquery plugins
[15:42:16] <shoky> you're not there yet..
[15:43:11] <Triex> indeed
[15:43:24] <shoky> Triex: also, i told you how to solve that issue
[15:43:31] <shoky> so you can finish the task ;P
[15:43:47] <Triex> classes instead of types?
[15:44:11] <Triex> and i put the multiple class definitions for laziness sake haha
[15:44:11] <shoky> yes and dont have multiple class="..."  attributes on the same element..
[15:44:17] * tw2113 has class
[15:44:22] <shoky> how's that being lazy :\
[15:44:22] <Triex> for the width etc
[15:44:29] <shoky> it's more typing
[15:44:31] <tw2113> <tw2113 class="awesome">
[15:44:41] <Triex> the text one is just width
[15:45:04] <shoky> $('.awesome').feed( $.cookie )
[15:45:09] <Triex> and if I use classes instead of type, it doesnt call up the jq :/
[15:45:20] <shoky> huh.
[15:45:30] <Triex> it doesnt work
[15:45:31] <Triex> haha
[15:45:43] <Triex> and ah
[15:45:55] <shoky> also where did you get that 'datefields' thing
[15:46:01] <blindMoe> this conversation looks like it is about to go back to the "learn javascript then jquery" part that we already passed
[15:46:21] <tw2113> you mean people don't do that blindMoe ?
[15:47:53] <Triex> I have no idea, lol. shoky.
[15:47:58] <Triex> & blindMoe, I will be doing that
[15:49:24] <rosieres> how can i prevent doubleclick issues in ajax menues ?
[15:50:13] <Triex> well I'm gonna try finish it, somehow. When I finish I can finally go onto learning basics haha
[15:51:43] <shoky> Triex:  http://pastebin.com/0V0bwqVK
[15:51:53] <shoky> a bit more normal now..
[15:53:24] <Triex> shoky, thanks <3
[15:53:41] <shoky> ;]
[15:54:21] <krz> any recommendations for a sorting plugin?
[15:54:39] <shoky> sorting what?
[15:54:47] <Zerpex> Hello, I'm working with the jquery .load() for AJAX calls to load some external content each 5 minutes.. But it gets cached by the browser, is there a way to prevent this?
[15:54:57] <krz> li elements based on the data-count attribute
[15:54:59] <xp_prg2> hi all, I am curious if using jquery ui tabs within other tabs is supported well, does anyone know?
[15:55:28] <krz> so the li element with the highest data-count number will be put on top
[15:55:48] <ohaibbq> ?tias xp_prg2
[15:55:52] <ohaibbq> ?tias
[15:55:56] <ohaibbq> no dice
[15:55:59] <shoky> Zerpex: you can set cache:false  option if you use $.ajax
[15:56:16] <ohaibbq> xp_prg2: there shouldn't be any problem with it and it should be supported
[15:56:46] <ohaibbq> one think you have to look out for is making sure the elements you call .tab on exist in their parent tab
[15:56:47] * xp_prg2 hugs ohaibbq *close*
[15:57:01] <xp_prg2> oh good advice thanks!
[15:57:26] <ohaibbq> like if you're ajaxing in the parent tab's contents
[15:57:59] <Zerpex> shoky: so how would you do with this one: $('.serverLoad').load('../system/systemload.php');
[15:59:42] <ohaibbq> Zerpex: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[16:00:30] <shoky> Zerpex: $.ajax({url:'../system/systemload.php', cache:false}).done( function(data) { $('.serverLoad').html(data) } )    or smth
[16:00:37] <NotreDev> i'm using jqueryform, and in my view code I validate submission. if validation fails, what am i supposed to return?
[16:00:57] <eip56> Zerpex .load() is just an alias for .ajax  check out the docs. it should be really easy for you to transition. THe only difference is you get to define more parameters with .ajax
[16:02:05] <pace_t_zulu> hey guys
[16:02:06] <NotreDev> if i just return a typical json response with a form noting the validation errors, it's interpreted as a success; while this is a successful server response, it doesn't mean that the form submission was successful.
[16:02:11] <NotreDev> that's my problem in a nutshell
[16:02:24] <pace_t_zulu> how do i run certain code after other code has *completely* finished?
[16:02:36] <shoky> .load() is not just an alias for ajax..
[16:02:52] <pace_t_zulu> shoky: was that directed at me?
[16:03:08] <shoky> pace_t_zulu: no. what code is it that you want to wait for ?
[16:03:59] <shoky> pace_t_zulu:    a; b;    <-- b will always run after a
[16:04:02] <rosieres> can´t I use the dblclick() to prevent any further execution of the second mouseclick ? but how ? atm. I just fire an alert but afterwards the second click is executed . . .
[16:04:34] <pace_t_zulu> shoky: yea
[16:04:40] <shoky> rosieres: probably mouseclick event occurs BEFORE dblclick
[16:04:56] <pace_t_zulu> shoky: how would i run b only after a is complete?
[16:05:03] <shoky> pace_t_zulu: just like that
[16:05:09] <shoky> pace_t_zulu: what do you mean by complete?
[16:05:27] <rosieres> shoky: makes sense *omg . . . gotta go to bed . . . n8
[16:05:28] <RandalSchwartz> pace_t_zulu - were you aksking thi syesterday?
[16:05:37] <RandalSchwartz> if so, the answer is the same as yesaterday
[16:05:40] <pace_t_zulu> RandalSchwartz: no ... not me
[16:05:43] <RandalSchwartz> put a callback in your final animation
[16:05:47] <pace_t_zulu> RandalSchwartz: must have been something else
[16:05:54] <RandalSchwartz> ahh a common problem then
[16:06:02] <RandalSchwartz> people not understanding the async nature of event programming
[16:06:12] <shoky> the most common in this channel
[16:06:28] <pace_t_zulu> shoky: don't do anything in function b until all operations (all the way down the stack) from function a are complete
[16:06:42] <shoky> pace_t_zulu: you're using the terminology all wrong
[16:06:48] <shoky> so don't try :)
[16:07:08] <shoky> pace_t_zulu: i presume that "function a" is an ajax call or an animation ?
[16:07:27] <pace_t_zulu> shoky: it makes a ajax call in a subfunction
[16:07:30] <shoky> if you wouldn't hide details you'd get much quicker/better help
[16:07:46] <RandalSchwartz> so yeah, you need to hav a callback from that ajax call
[16:07:47] <shoky> then that ajax call returns an object
[16:07:51] <pace_t_zulu> shoky: can't easily share them unfortunately
[16:08:00] <shoky> call .done on that object passing a callback
[16:08:16] <Triex> shoky, I wrote some code to set the default value in the text boxes as well
[16:08:16] <Triex> $("#departureDate").datepicker();
[16:08:17] <Triex> 				$("#departureDate").datepicker("setDate", new Date());
[16:08:18] <shoky> that done callback will always be called when the ajax call has returned
[16:08:20] <Triex> is this the right way to do it?
[16:08:23] <shoky> responded
[16:08:23] <Triex> Or am I wrong again, lol
[16:08:45] <shoky> Triex: do the docs say to do it like that?
[16:08:56] <Triex> They say nothing, haha
[16:09:00] <shoky> then why are you guessing?
[16:09:14] <Triex> Well I asked you if it's a good way to do it, or is there some better way :v
[16:09:14] <shoky> what good would that do
[16:09:20] <shoky> guessing is not a good way to do anything, no
[16:09:26] <shoky> well, some things. but not coding :P
[16:09:28] <Triex> Well it works
[16:09:37] <shoky> well good, what does it do
[16:10:00] <Triex> Sets the default value in the text boxes for the departure, as it should
[16:10:58] <shoky> oks
[16:11:14] <tab1293> how do you traverse backwards from an element until you hit the first label tag?
[16:11:26] <shoky> tab1293: what's backwards?
[16:11:41] <tab1293> up the dom tree
[16:11:54] <shoky> .closest('labe')
[16:11:57] <shoky> .closest('label')
[16:15:58] <tab1293> shoky: not doing it for me. is closest() essentially "prev() until you hit the first label tag preceding the element"?
[16:16:09] <tab1293> *closest('label')
[16:16:18] <shoky> no it's .parent()
[16:16:21] <shoky> not prev()
[16:16:44] <shoky> you can try with prevAll(...) i guess
[16:16:46] <tab1293> ok what should i use so the logic is using prev()
[16:17:16] <shoky> maybe prevAll('label').last()  donno
[16:17:21] <shoky> fiddle with it
[16:18:24] <shoky> um
[16:19:32] <shoky> ahh tab1293 there's .prevUntil()
[16:19:44] <tab1293> i basically just want to find the closest label tag regardless if its a sibling or parent
[16:19:55] <shoky> ah sorrry prevUntil doesnt do it
[16:20:12] <tab1293> yeah thats all except the matched
[16:20:23] <shoky> regardless? umm
[16:20:30] <tab1293> but my problem is sometimes the label tag is a sibiling and sometimes its a parent
[16:20:34] <tab1293> i guess that makes it harder
[16:20:37] <shoky> dont think there's a builtin method that does that for you..
[16:20:41] <tab1293> yeah
[16:40:19] <gasull> What's the meaning of the colon in $('#outbound_email_form :input').val('');?
[16:40:19] <gasull> Why does it work while $('#outbound_email_form input').val('') does not?
[16:41:00] <ohaibbq> gasull: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[16:42:06] <gasull> ohaibbq: thank you
[16:42:48] <gasull> Shouldn't $('#outbound_email_form input').val('') work as well?
[16:43:05] <gasull> oh, i see
[16:43:07] <ohaibbq> :)
[16:45:35] <tab1293> anyone know why element.prev().attr('id') returns undefined?
[16:46:45] <fsd> because the id of the previous element of your element is undefined
[16:47:10] <tab1293> but the syntax is correct?
[16:47:21] <Escherial> hey, what'd be the cleanest way to get specific children of an element that has an element with a particular text value?
[16:47:24] <fsd> it depends on what you're trying to do
[16:48:00] <Escherial> e.g. <survey><id>hello</id><prompts><prompt>a</prompt><prompt>b</prompt></prompts></survey> ...i need to get the survey with id 'hello', then get at the prompts for that survey
[16:48:05] <Escherial> preferably in one pass
[16:48:05] <Triex> shoky, this datepicker thing hates me, lol
[16:48:07] <Triex> http://pastebin.com/FUD84Pcd
[16:48:09] <Triex> shoky, ^
[16:48:32] <Triex> >>>minimum dates>>
[16:48:33] <Escherial> i'm not even sure how to specify a selector that includes the contents of a node and not an attribute
[16:48:37] <Escherial> really hating this format :|
[16:48:47] <snover> Escherial: sounds like what you want is xpath.
[16:50:20] <Escherial> snover: can i get at that from the result of a call to $.parseXML()?
[16:50:34] <snover> no
[16:50:40] <snover> i mean
[16:50:47] <snover> maybe but why are you using jquery thenâ€¦
[16:51:09] <Escherial> i need to parse the XML client-side, since the user can edit the xml on the page and i want the results to be reflected in a graphical editor without a round trip
[16:51:24] <snover> you have a requirement to use xml?
[16:52:03] <raj> omg
[16:52:05] <Escherial> yes, unfortunately :\ i'm writing a tool for managing these "campaign descriptions" that our system uses to render EMAs on our participants' phones
[16:52:05] <raj> shakakai,
[16:52:07] <raj> oops
[16:52:08] <raj> shoky,
[16:52:11] <Escherial> the campaign descriptions are in xml, thus...
[16:52:51] <Escherial> well, this seems to work, although it's not pretty: $xmlDoc.find("survey id:contains('lunchTracker')").parent().find("prompt")
[16:53:08] <Escherial> the contains is especially concerning...is there something like :contains(), but that finds exact matches?
[16:53:10] <snover> Escherial: maybe you want to add a data abstraction layer and convert from xml to js and back?
[16:53:24] <snover> so that your application code does not have to care about the serialization format of your data.
[16:53:42] <snover> right now you are forcing your application code to use a non-natural data format because your server requires xml
[16:54:00] <javalover> is there a way to make a javascript array variable final?
[16:54:14] <javalover> I.E. i'm looping through and adding .mouseup functions to a bunch of photos
[16:54:15] <Escherial> snover: the application is principally concerned with the format of the data; it's not just serialization. the tool is supposed to help instruct the user on how to write xml (as odd as that may sound)
[16:54:24] <Escherial> i see where you're coming from, and i'd normally agree, but this is a special case
[16:54:36] <javalover> and each one somehow is thinking it's marray[6] even though i'm saying marray[i];
[16:54:44] <shoky> Triex: look at the difference between how you used the setDate method vs how you used the minDate method.......
[16:54:54] <javalover> i take it i have to declare final.....
[16:55:21] <shoky> Triex: you dont need to do all those though, you can put all of the initialization options in the first call to .datepicker()
[16:55:49] <shoky> sup raj
[16:56:00] <Triex> shoky, the {}?
[16:56:33] <Escherial> is there an alternative to :contains() that checks if the current node's text matches the given text exactly?
[16:56:46] <Triex> and ah, I thought I could do something like that - I was just worried I'd break it before i finish. Lol
[16:56:48] <Escherial> it should automatically be false if the current node has children, too
[16:58:12] <shoky> Triex: when you use an option/method , READ IT FULL and understand every sentence, otherwise you're guessing
[16:58:41] <Triex> I couldn't find all the info on it :(
[16:58:49] <Triex> I just found some threads, with other people doing it
[16:58:59] <Escherial> also, what's the current word on templates? what are we supposed to use to render a potentially repeated set of elements in a way that doesn't involve cobbling it together tag by tag with appendTo()?
[16:59:02] <shoky> it's all here http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-minDate
[16:59:02] <shoky> ..
[16:59:26] <shoky> Escherial: http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[16:59:38] <shoky> Escherial: and there are many more
[16:59:54] <shoky> i use knockout.js but not just for templating
[16:59:54] <Triex> :v
[17:00:16] <silverwind> shoky, how do you like it?
[17:00:22] <shoky> i like it very much
[17:00:45] <silverwind> silverwind, good, I might try it because so far, I'm very unsatisfied with backbone.
[17:01:01] <shoky> i even submitted a commit/pull request ;PP
[17:01:02] <silverwind> I was thinking of trying backbone.
[17:01:04] <silverwind> Errr
[17:01:06] <silverwind> Ember.js
[17:01:09] <Escherial> shoky: heh, this is a fun little tool
[17:01:20] <Escherial> would be nice if there was a brief explanation of each category
[17:01:30] <shoky> i haven't used backbone/ember
[17:01:35] <shoky> just read about them
[17:01:35] <Escherial> (for instance, "partials"...not really sure what's meant there. does that mean rendering a piece of the page as opposed to an entire one?)
[17:01:49] <Escherial> fair enough :)
[17:01:54] <shoky> yeah Escherial it's not the most informative page ;)
[17:02:02] <shoky> but its cute
[17:05:02] <Triex> well thanks for your help guys, I'm gonna run off.. way too tired.. I'll just wait til my brother wakes up and beg him to help. Lol
[17:05:12] <Triex> Bai <3
[17:05:14] <shoky> or sleep :P
[17:05:20] <shoky> by
[17:05:26] <Triex> I want to sleep, haha =P
[17:05:27] <tw2113> therefore beer
[17:05:36] <Triex> 10am already!
[17:05:42] <shoky> yack
[17:06:30] * Triex waves goodbye
[17:14:39] <Lucky--> one thing im always confused about in jquery is the .html() .text() and .append() are they getters ONLY or setters too?
[17:15:37] <shoky> .html and .text are both getters and setters
[17:15:45] <shoky> .append is neither
[17:15:47] <Lucky--> they should update the jquery docs
[17:15:50] <Lucky--> to specify that for clarity
[17:15:57] <shoky> seems pretty clear to me
[17:16:20] <shoky> Contents:
[17:16:25] <shoky> html()
[17:16:28] <shoky> html( htmlString  )
[17:17:12] <shoky> well the docs could be a bit nicer yeah, but they still contain all the info you need if you bother to read enough
[17:17:22] <shoky> and test on your own of course..
[17:17:53] <shoky> people who dont really read the docs shouldnt be using the library
[17:18:02] <Lucky--> trust me read the docs
[17:18:16] <Lucky--> i just go back and forth ebtween diff languages sometimes
[17:18:20] <Lucky--> *all the time
[17:18:21] <shoky> also it's just common sense
[17:18:36] <Lucky--> shoky: it is, except for when things dont work as intended
[17:18:40] <shoky> with jquery usually whatever makes sense is the way it is.. .html and .text it makes sense that you'd both get and set them
[17:18:44] <Lucky--> you start examining and double checking every detail
[17:18:48] <shoky> .append... makes no sense that its a getter (or a setter..)
[17:19:49] <shoky> between the docs and today's debugging tools, i'd say that handling getter/setter stuff is a no-brainer
[17:20:53] <andr0id1> has anyone worked with jquery autocomplete remote json datasource?
[17:21:08] <shoky> andr0id1: what do you think?
[17:21:34] <andr0id1> dont know man, its been two days and i still cant figure this thing out
[17:21:43] <shoky> what does that have to do with it
[17:21:56] <andr0id1> just answering your question
[17:22:14] <Lucky--> andr0id1: kendoui, huh
[17:22:27] <andr0id1> can anyone help me with that or not?
[17:22:30] <shoky> with what?
[17:22:42] <andr0id1> with jquery autocomplete json
[17:22:51] <shoky> you said that already
[17:22:53] <andr0id1> its about the ajax response
[17:23:52] <shoky> sry sounds too hard. noone can help you
[17:25:17] <andr0id1> i well the only problem is that i get the json objects put them in a array, but i dont see the autocomplete. there is something missing from the array code
[17:26:43] <andr0id1> function makeTheArrayFromData(data) {
[17:26:43] <andr0id1> for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
[17:26:43] <andr0id1> var entry = data[i];
[17:26:43] <andr0id1> var hashForAutocomplete = entry.name + ' ' = entry.party_name;
[17:26:43] <andr0id1> resultingArray.push(hashForAutocomplete);
[17:26:44] <andr0id1> }
[17:26:46] <andr0id1> return resultingArray;
[17:26:48] <andr0id1> }
[17:26:50] <andr0id1> ups
[17:26:50] <shoky> dont paste code here
[17:26:52] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/x37br6yg
[17:26:54] <andr0id1> sorry
[17:26:59] <andr0id1> my mistake
[17:27:04] <Escherial> :|
[17:27:20] <andr0id1> so what do i miss in tghis code?
[17:27:49] <Escherial> not really sure what this means: var hashForAutocomplete = entry.name + ' ' = entry.party_name;
[17:27:52] <Escherial> what are you trying to do there?
[17:28:16] <phpkiddy123> concat the name and part_name?
[17:28:17] <Escherial> also, i think it'd help to sort out your buzzwords and describe what you want to do in english
[17:28:28] <phpkiddy123> * party_name?
[17:28:31] <Escherial> "jquery autocomplete json" doesn't make any sense
[17:28:45] <Escherial> right, but he's doing two assignments, and one of them is to a string, which is immutable...
[17:28:54] <andr0id1> i try to access the json object, go through them and just display the name and party name, i need this for jquery autocomplete
[17:28:55] <shoky> yeah that equals sign is surely supposed to be a plus
[17:29:00] <shoky> andr0id1: ^^
[17:29:16] <andr0id1> corrected it, but it still doesnt work
[17:29:29] <phpkiddy123> what's not working?
[17:29:35] <phpkiddy123> did you console.log(..);
[17:29:37] <phpkiddy123> ?
[17:29:56] <shoky> andr0id1: btw you can just do: var resultingArray =  $.map( data, function() { return this.name + ' ' + this.party_name; } )
[17:30:05] <shoky> instead of that whole function
[17:30:21] <andr0id1> yes,i see the requests to the remote json datasource, but no results...
[17:30:37] <shoky> the php is not outputting anything?
[17:30:41] <andr0id1> nope
[17:31:03] <shoky> oops you didnt say its a php
[17:31:13] <shoky> its a php? :)
[17:31:34] <andr0id1> yes
[17:31:42] <shoky> so the problem is with your php?
[17:31:47] <phpkiddy123> o then you concatinate with dots , not +'s?
[17:31:49] <shoky> because he's the one not outputting anything ?
[17:32:12] <shoky> the code where he concatenated was javascript, not php ...
[17:32:13] <phpkiddy123> nm me here :0
[17:32:16] <shoky> ^^
[17:32:25] <andr0id1> if i do this, success: function( data ) { response( [ { value: 'Basescu', label:'Traian'}, { value: 'Antonescu', label: 'Crin'} ]); } i see autocomplete with the two values
[17:33:07] <shoky> success of what?
[17:33:32] <phpkiddy123> $.ajax?
[17:33:35] <andr0id1> yes
[17:33:45] <shoky> but you're using autocomplete, no
[17:34:02] <shoky> (sorry i havent used it myself)
[17:34:18] <shoky> but i thought it does the ajax call for you
[17:34:58] <andr0id1> well yes, it does, if i write static values like : success: function( data ) { response( [ { value: 'Basescu', label:'Traian'}, { value: 'Antonescu', label: 'Crin'} ]); }, i see results in the autocomplete...
[17:35:07] <shoky> where do you write that?
[17:35:24] <shoky> why not just pastebin the whole thing..
[17:35:34] <andr0id1> ok, just a sec
[17:36:13] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/v24P9te6
[17:36:32] <shoky> so you're using the 'source' option
[17:36:40] <shoky> why hide the fact :\
[17:36:42] <andr0id1> yes
[17:38:07] <shoky> sorry for yelling ;)
[17:38:24] <shoky> or being irritable
[17:38:48] <andr0id1> in the success, if it stays like that, i am getting those two values, but if i add the code with the array, i dont get anything
[17:39:34] <andr0id1> what am i doing wrong there?
[17:40:11] <shoky> you'd have to show me that code..
[17:40:38] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/x37br6yg
[17:40:44] <shoky> not that
[17:40:53] <andr0id1> what code do you need?
[17:40:58] <shoky> i dont see you calling that function
[17:41:01] <phpkiddy123> the code with the array that is ?
[17:41:11] <andr0id1> yes, i put that in the response
[17:41:16] <shoky> i just want to get the whole picture without stuff left out
[17:41:22] <shoky> otherwise its just a waste of time
[17:41:22] <phpkiddy123> sure
[17:41:28] <andr0id1> i mean in the success
[17:41:35] <shoky> andr0id1: the code, please
[17:41:39] <phpkiddy123> havent' seen you yelling ;
[17:41:48] <shoky> of that success  with the function call ..
[17:41:49] <andr0id1> just a sec
[17:41:59] <shoky> you know, the code thats failing :)
[17:42:55] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/f5UkczLM
[17:43:05] <shoky> wait
[17:43:08] <shoky> h
[17:43:09] <shoky> nm
[17:43:17] <shoky> wtf
[17:43:23] <shoky> you just pasted the function in there ?
[17:43:39] <scathen^C> hey guys i need some ideas. ive got in place editing working for some stuff on my page, but while in "editing" mode i would like the user to be able to resize iframes. Any ideas how i could essentially turn off the interactivity of the object (say an embedded youtube clip) so that the user could select the iframe like an image??
[17:43:41] <shoky> come on man its not your first day programming, is it ?
[17:43:47] <shoky> plz fix that without any hints.
[17:44:37] <andr0id1> shoky: yes, i use it like that. what am i doing wrong?
[17:44:49] <shoky> andr0id1: functions are made to be called, not copy & pasted
[17:44:55] <shoky> called or passed around
[17:45:26] <shoky> andr0id1: e.g.  success: function(data) { response( makeTheArrayFromData(data) ) }
[17:45:36] <shoky> but that probably wont work because i don't think data is an array
[17:45:39] <shoky> ;)
[17:45:48] <andr0id1> data is json
[17:46:09] <shoky> then specify dataType: 'json'  in the $.ajax request
[17:46:38] <shoky> and then just do:    success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function() { return this.name + ' ' + this.party_name; } ) ) }
[17:46:57] <andr0id1> ok, where should the makeTheArrayFromData be? where should i put it?
[17:47:02] <shoky> nowhere, please remove it
[17:47:44] <andr0id1> so instead of the function, just add this: success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function() { return this.name + ' ' + this.party_name; } ) ) }
[17:48:15] <shoky> instead of the success: that you currently have, yes
[17:49:26] <andr0id1> well, now, after adding this, i get the previous problem: i get an autocomplete with all the fields named: undefined
[17:49:32] <andr0id1> i am back where i started
[17:50:01] <shoky> do console.log(data);   before the response( ...
[17:50:45] <shoky> and also pastebin your new code..
[17:51:30] <shoky> ah sorry
[17:51:32] <shoky> my code was wrong
[17:52:15] <andr0id1> i see the json object, in the console, but in the autocomplete i get all fields undefined
[17:52:24] <shoky> what does the json object look like
[17:52:54] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/x5H86BwU
[17:53:01] <andr0id1> thats what it looks like
[17:53:40] <shoky> that's the output of console.log(data) ?
[17:54:02] <andr0id1> yes, and after that, after the object, i see every character in a separate line
[17:54:16] <shoky> hmm?
[17:54:39] <andr0id1> every character you see in the object, is placed in a separate line
[17:54:55] <shoky> that sounds weird
[17:55:04] <andr0id1> so something like:
[17:55:05] <andr0id1> [
[17:55:06] <andr0id1> {
[17:55:08] <andr0id1> "
[17:55:10] <shoky> yea i understood..
[17:55:11] <andr0id1> i
[17:55:14] <andr0id1> and so on
[17:55:27] <shoky> uhh i have no idea what that's about :)
[17:55:43] <phpkiddy123> escaping issues?
[17:55:58] <shoky> shrugz
[17:56:23] <andr0id1> any ideas on how to fix that?
[17:57:15] <shoky> try:
[17:58:34] <shoky> success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name + ' ' el.party_name; } ) ) }
[17:59:41] <andr0id1> that didnt worked either, i am getting the same thing like before
[17:59:54] <shoky> umm
[18:01:06] <andr0id1> still getting the: undefined fields
[18:01:54] <shoky> what does console.log( $.type(data), data )   output?
[18:02:08] <shoky> (and pastebin your code again ;)
[18:04:30] <shoky> data is supposed to be an object, not an array, i think..
[18:05:44] <andr0id1> yes, data is an object
[18:05:55] <shoky> but what you pasted is an array
[18:06:31] <shoky> so , whats up with that
[18:06:31] <shoky> ;p
[18:07:33] <andr0id1> thats what i get from the object, somehow it is converted in array
[18:08:01] <shoky> what did console.log( $.type(data), data )   output?
[18:08:09] <Lucky--> whats the best jquery wait command, i dont want to call a funciton, just pause thread execution
[18:08:23] <shoky> pause thread execution? no you dont want to do that
[18:08:32] <shoky> Lucky--: setTimeout()
[18:10:12] <jerrico> i'm using Modernizr.prefixed( "transform" ) to get back a prefixed transform in camelCase format. $.css() takes the dash-separated form. can i just use the camelCase string on element.style.camelCasedTransform?
[18:13:45] <andr0id1> its jerking me arround :@
[18:17:07] <shoky> jerk right back
[18:18:30] <Lucky--> anyone got any pointers on how to axe the backwards moving behavior, but still reset it?
[18:18:52] <shoky> hm?
[18:19:45] <Lucky--> http://jsfiddle.net/snYe9/2/
[18:19:47] <Lucky--> that might help.
[18:20:56] <andr0id1> shoky, http://pastebin.com/5dCYDTaa
[18:21:50] <shoky> wtf..
[18:22:05] <shoky> that's the output from console.log( $.type(data), data )  ?
[18:23:23] <andr0id1> yes
[18:26:37] <andr0id1> any idea why i get that ?
[18:26:44] <shoky> nope
[18:27:20] <shoky> you put dataType: 'json'  ?
[18:27:26] <andr0id1> yes
[18:27:56] <shoky> so when you do  console.log( data )  it shows you that array normally AND ALSO each char on a seperate line
[18:28:11] <shoky> and when you do console.log( $.type(data), data )   it ONLY shows you each char on a seperate line ?
[18:28:26] <andr0id1> now i get this: array [Object { id="453", name="Antonescu Crin", party="1", more...}]
[18:28:35] <shoky> what do you mean now
[18:28:37] <shoky> what did you change
[18:28:42] <shoky> that looks fine
[18:29:07] <shoky> what browser are you on
[18:29:13] <andr0id1> firefox
[18:29:20] <andr0id1> with firebug for debugging
[18:29:24] <shoky> k
[18:29:33] <shoky> so that looks fine..
[18:30:01] <shoky> though i still dont understand how its an array and not an ojbject
[18:30:39] <andr0id1> yeah, now, the only problem i have, is how to get the name and party_name and display them in the autocomplete, the function i wrote doesn't work
[18:30:40] <shoky> what did you change ?
[18:30:51] <shoky> dont use the function you wrote then
[18:31:04] <shoky> success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name + ' ' el.party_name; } ) ) }
[18:31:08] <andr0id1> well, it was a problem of browser caching, cleared the cache and now works
[18:31:13] <shoky> eh
[18:32:20] <andr0id1> OHHH YEAH :D it works now :D
[18:32:51] <shoky> ;]
[18:34:08] <andr0id1> i owe you big time :D
[18:34:13] <andr0id1> beer keg :D
[18:34:29] <shoky> mail me some bud ;P
[18:34:39] <andr0id1> budweiser?
[18:34:48] <shoky> mmm i was thinkin of somethin else :P
[18:35:02] <andr0id1> what is that? :D
[18:35:07] <shoky> loll nvm ;D
[18:35:33] <andr0id1> hahaha :D you know best :)
[18:39:08] <gasull> What's the most standard way of getting the JSON returned by a $.post()?
[18:39:40] <shoky> gasull: you should be getting it as the argument to your callback function
[18:39:57] <gasull> shoky: oh, thanks
[18:40:05] <shoky> you can do
[18:40:47] <shoky> $.post('url', data, 'json').done( function(data) { ... here data is the json object ... } )
[18:42:56] <mustefaj> are questions about json syntax appropriate here?
[18:45:40] <tw2113> well you haven't been told no yet mustefaj
[18:45:52] <mustefaj> sorry i got caught up reading :P
[18:45:58] <mustefaj> http://jsfiddle.net/FvP6e/4/
[18:46:00] <tw2113> about json syntax?
[18:46:09] <mustefaj> does that seem right?
[18:46:59] <mustefaj> what about it am i asking to seem right, question would be: i have an array of questions inside of an introduction
[18:46:59] <tw2113> http://jsonlint.com/
[18:47:06] <mustefaj> oh snap
[18:47:12] <mustefaj> shit just got real.
[18:48:54] <someprimetime> how can i do like if not $(document).bind('mousewheel', function() { }); ?
[18:49:05] <shoky> if not?
[18:49:38] <someprimetime> well like !(mousewheel)
[18:49:59] <shoky> english plz
[18:50:01] <someprimetime> i just want to ignore that event
[18:50:09] <someprimetime> while the user is not using the mousewheel, do some shit
[18:50:26] <shoky> then do some shit and stop doing it when the user uses the mousewheel ?
[18:50:40] <gasull> shoky: thanks, but what if I want to process JSON returned by $.post() when it fails?
[18:50:42] <shoky> what shit do you wanna do
[18:50:55] <someprimetime> well i just want to find out when the user uses the mouseswheel
[18:51:02] <shoky> gasull:  if it fails you won't get any data in your response...
[18:51:02] <someprimetime> mousewheel, rather
[18:51:05] <someprimetime> what a weird word
[18:51:07] <mustefaj> @tw2113: its expecting something after the 2nd colon
[18:51:08] <mustefaj> http://jsfiddle.net/FvP6e/5/
[18:51:21] <mustefaj> line 3
[18:51:26] <mustefaj> dont get why
[18:51:45] <tw2113> mustefaj i got this to validate http://pastebin.com/tyy0GgKz
[18:51:57] <mustefaj> sec comparing
[18:52:39] <mustefaj> so each element of the array is an object here?
[18:53:00] <wavez> how do I use "this" in a selector?
[18:53:07] <mustefaj> $(this).
[18:53:16] <wavez> would it be: this+" div" to select the div inside this?
[18:53:24] <tw2113> you'd be able to accest stuff like introduiction.outlineText
[18:53:39] <shoky> someprimetime: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel
[18:53:58] <mustefaj> do you mean introduction.[0].outlineText?
[18:54:05] <mustefaj> cause there's two outline texts?
[18:54:15] <mustefaj> and likewise for [1]?
[18:54:20] <mustefaj> that was going to be my next question
[18:54:25] <tw2113> i think you'd need to make a 2nd array index actually for that
[18:54:37] <tw2113> just noticed the inner items are the same in both halves, for introduction
[18:54:47] <someprimetime> shoky: gracias
[18:54:49] <wavez> ah, had to be this+"div" without the space
[18:55:03] <tw2113> i'd keep working out the details at this point :)
[18:55:21] <tw2113> mustefaj you can use this if you want an example reference https://gist.github.com/2439397
[18:55:42] <mustefaj> great, thanks.  let me try to get some mileage out of that
[18:55:44] <mustefaj> appreciated.
[18:55:49] <tw2113> and probably get some humor too
[18:55:53] <mustefaj> lol
[18:56:06] <tw2113> <3 my fake band name
[18:56:11] <mustefaj> oh that's yours lol
[18:56:20] <tw2113> those are actual mix cds
[18:56:21] <mustefaj> achoo and sneezes 4 life
[18:56:58] <mustefaj> how do you access the 1st track of the second album?
[18:57:17] <mustefaj> that's a bad question since i'll be looping them
[18:57:44] <tw2113> not quite sure, i have never tested using the data in a loop case
[18:58:22] <mustefaj> gonna fiddle with this, thanks again
[18:58:22] <tw2113> i probably did it all in JSON just for shits n giggles of it
[18:58:53] <wavez> Okay, I tricked myself. this+"div" didn't work.
[18:59:10] <shoky> what is 'this' ?
[18:59:13] <wavez> how to select like this? $(this+" div") ?
[18:59:20] <shoky> what is 'this' ?
[18:59:25] <wavez> keyword this
[18:59:33] <shoky> yes, what is it referring to
[18:59:40] <shoky> what object
[18:59:48] <shoky> it changes, you know
[19:00:53] <wavez> shoky, right. It's being called by jqGrid. How can I output the type of object?
[19:01:09] <wavez> It should be a jqGrid row object
[19:01:12] <shoky> console.log( $.type(this) )
[19:01:26] <shoky> then how would that work as a selector..?
[19:01:57] <wavez> actually it should be specific to the cell I'm trying to put a progress bar in
[19:02:23] <shoky> maybe you want $(this).find('div')  , no idea
[19:02:34] <shoky> because i still dont know what this is
[19:02:57] <sirtophat> is there a way to get the state of the keyboard without making .keydown/keyup events for every key
[19:03:52] <mustefaj> @wavez what does "this" represent in what you're doing
[19:05:04] <wavez> mustefaj, shoky, okay, hold on, I'm trying this
[19:06:12] <shoky> wavez: you're using jqGrid, so use its documentation, which says:As of version 3.6.3 to every event is passed the reference (this) to the grid. This means that inside every event you can use $(this) which refers to the grid.
[19:06:26] <tw2113> i'll use a relatively easy example
[19:06:42] <tw2113> say you have an array of divs, and you're running $.each() on it
[19:06:56] <tw2113> "this" would represent the current div element you're iterating over
[19:07:00] <wavez> shoky, it just says "object"
[19:07:06] <wavez> & mustefaj
[19:07:07] <shoky> wavez: indeed
[19:07:21] <shoky> why did you think that you can use it as a selector...
[19:07:30] <wavez> ahh, okay
[19:07:34] <shoky> it's a plugin-specific object
[19:07:48] <shoky> selectors are just strings
[19:08:03] <wavez> I'm using the Formatter to call a custom function to put a jQuery progressbar() in a cell.
[19:08:33] <wavez> I was able to put div tags in the cell and then run progressbar on the document using .each(), but that doesn't work ultimately because,
[19:08:47] <wavez> after the user changes the sort order, all my rows are destroyed and recreated.
[19:09:07] <wavez> So I have to pass Formatter a custom function that creates the progress bar.
[19:09:15] <mustefaj> @tw2113: http://jsfiddle.net/FvP6e/7/
[19:09:17] <shoky> that is really too much info. good luck :\
[19:09:19] <shoky> & good night
[19:09:39] <mustefaj> got to where i wanted with that, thanks man.
[19:13:36] <tw2113> go you mustefaj
[19:38:38] <Zed7> in a jquery if statement is && the correct syntax for contains or includes eg: if (myurl && 'contact-us') {} ?
[19:39:14] <Zed7> in this case myurl is a var: var myurl = window.location.href
[20:20:20] <Chuguniy> Hi, is it possible exclude other elements with the same class name from triggering?
[20:21:04] <Chuguniy> I got 5 links with the same class, but I need that only one is triggerd, that which is pressed.
[20:33:29] <waal> Ñ€ÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ñ… Ñ‚ÑƒÑ‚ Ð½ÐµÑ‚ ?
[20:35:01] <StephanW> Helo.  I initialize the loading of my 1st jQuery app on my page by "$('#test',context).myjQueryApp();".  When I need to reload the app if I just reinit, then it works -- but clicks and actions are acting funny.  If I reload the whole page everythings OK again.
[20:35:12] <StephanW> I think this means I need to remove() then re-init.  I tried "$('#test',context).remove().myjQueryApp();" but that makes the display disappear.
[20:35:21] <StephanW> What's the right way to remove then reload?
[20:37:51] <Vinny> anyone good with regex?
[20:39:01] <bung> quick question about the seperation of plugins.js and scripts.js (that you'd see in say html5boilerplat) ... is there any benefit to keeping them seperate in a production environment? browser might cache the plugins.js script, where the scripts.js file might get updated from time to time?
[20:42:33] <Vinny> nvm got it ;)
[20:46:40] <Zed7> Chuguniy: can you please paste your code into pastie.org and I will take a look
[20:53:11] <nights> hi
[20:54:08] <nights> whats the simplest way to implement a like a tab system, without the need for fanciness just different panels that show when you select their respective label
[20:54:30] <nights> jquery-tabs is good, but if possible i would like to avoid the overhead?
[20:56:48] <Chuguniy> Zed7: http://pastebin.com/Q1sx1wVV
[20:58:48] <Zed7> cool ill take a look
[20:59:39] <Chuguniy> Thanks
[21:00:32] <Zed7> try this: http://pastebin.com/CXTiWjgT
[21:08:11] <Chuguniy> Zed7: Thanks a lot man! It worked ;)
[21:13:49] <StephanW> ok
[21:36:16] <Zed7> Chuguniy: your welcome happy to help :)
[21:47:29] <merlin1978> Do you know any free jquery plugin that do like this http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/05/jquery-filter-sort-plugins.html ?

[21:57:28] <wodemaye__> how can i select all the links that are to the same domain that my page was accessed from?
[22:00:34] <Cork> wodemaye__: you mean what domain the user came from?
[22:01:11] <gf3> WTF are you even building that has that requirement?!?1?!
[22:01:19] <gf3> WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING WITH THE WEB
[22:01:25] <snover> WHATâ€™S A WEB
[22:01:35] <wodemaye__> no.  like i actually want to do the inverse.  i need all the links on the page (which is hosted on xmpl.com) that point to domains other than xmpl.com
[22:02:19] <Cork> $('a[href^="http"]')
[22:02:58] <Cork> if they arn't absolut urls instead of full urls for the local links that one should work
[22:03:07] <wodemaye__> Cork, $("a").not("[href=\""+location.hostname+"\"]")
[22:03:14] <Cork> *if they are using absolute
[22:03:14] <wodemaye__> idk i'm just trying to brainstorm here.
[22:04:06] <wodemaye__> Cork, I want all urls regardless of how they're constructed (rel/abs, ssl/no sssl, port 8080/port 8181)
[22:04:46] <gf3> No
[22:04:48] <gf3> Stop
[22:04:53] <Cork> $('a').filter(function() { return true if you want it })
[22:05:01] <gf3> You guys stop putting all your dirty logic into selectors
[22:05:04] <gf3> Use filter
[22:05:12] <gf3> $("a").filter(function(idx, el){ return el.hostname != "xmpl.com" })
[22:05:22] <snover> wow.
[22:05:33] <Cork> gf3: the href selector isn't dirty
[22:05:41] <gf3> Cork: Yes it is
[22:05:53] <gf3> It's brittle, it's stupid, it's hard to test
[22:06:03] <systemfault> gf3++
[22:06:07] <Cork> uh, not really
[22:06:25] <Cork> sure when you get to more complex ones its a bad idea
[22:06:30] <Cork> but the first one isn't
[22:06:42] <gf3> Cork: Your suggestion is bad and you should feel bad
[22:06:51] <Cork> lol, how so?
[22:07:13] <systemfault> Because you gave a bad advice? :/
[22:07:15] <gf3> Like, you should feel shame for suggesting such things
[22:07:37] <Cork> give a reason why $('a[href^="http"]') is a bad selector
[22:07:43] <Cork> instead of just flaming
[22:07:51] <gf3> I just did
[22:07:54] <Cork> no
[22:07:57] <gf3> Oh
[22:07:59] <systemfault> He gave you 2 legitimate reasons..
[22:08:21] <Cork> its legit if you make more complex ones
[22:08:21] <gf3> Not only that, but it's not composable
[22:08:27] * wodemaye__ loves it.
[22:08:29] <gf3> Not that jQuery is very composable anyway
[22:09:10] <gf3> Regardless, it really makes it hard to build a set of simple predicates that you can reuse throughout your app
[22:09:29] <Cork> i'm completly with you if you try to move all sorts of weird combinations into the selector
[22:09:29] <snover> oh sorry
[22:09:35] <snover> reusable jquery?
[22:09:56] <gf3> Jquerry
[22:09:59] <wodemaye__> gf3, I feel like yours is more versatile and comprehensive.
[22:10:08] <gf3> wodemaye__: I assure you it is
[22:10:17] <gf3> wodemaye__: And testable
[22:10:19] <wodemaye__> gf3, what's idx though?
[22:10:23] <gf3> wodemaye__: And reusable
[22:10:32] <gf3> wodemaye__: And easier to understand
[22:10:43] <gf3> wodemaye__: It's the index of the element in the selection
[22:10:45] <wodemaye__> gf3, okay, i'm sold.. :) but what is idx?
[22:10:56] <wodemaye__> oh isee.
[22:11:00] <gf3> wodemaye__: jQuery uses non-standard signatures for iterators
[22:11:09] <wodemaye__> Sorry Cork ;)
[22:11:56] <wodemaye__> but why do u need to create a param receiver if its never even referred to in the function?
[22:12:13] <Cork> wodemaye__: if you check i did send the same solution too so, np
[22:12:56] <gf3> wodemaye__: Because it comes first
[22:13:07] <gf3> wodemaye__: Typically I would use _
[22:13:09] <wodemaye__> Cork, haha i'm not familiar with .filter(), so i'm glad that gf filled it in.
[22:13:14] <gf3> To indicate that it isn't use
[22:13:23] <gf3> d
[22:13:24] <wodemaye__> so why didn't youthis time gf3 ?
[22:13:53] <gf3> wodemaye__: Because I am showing you an example
[22:14:13] <wodemaye__> oh because i don't necessarily know about that "_" convention of yours?
[22:15:24] <gf3> Indeed, and `idx` is slightly more informative than `_`
[22:15:37] <wodemaye__> i like that _ convention though.
[22:15:59] <gf3> It's used a lot with pattern matching in real languages
[22:31:07] <wodemaye__> gf3, is there any way to access the actual object model of the a elements over which i'm iterating from within my anon function that's getting passed to .filter()?
[22:31:34] <gf3> wodemaye__: The entire selection?
[22:32:50] <wodemaye__> no.. i mean what is el.hostname?
[22:32:53] <wodemaye__> what is el?
[22:33:13] <gf3> wodemaye__: el is the current element in the selection
[22:33:42] <wodemaye__> like if we were in native js, i could just have document.getElementById('mylink').href.hostname ...couldn't i?
[22:33:48] <gf3> wodemaye__: .filter() goes over each element in the selection, and tosses out each one that the predicate returns false for
[22:33:59] <gf3> wodemaye__: The predicate is the function you pass in
[22:33:59] <wodemaye__> gf3, predicate?
[22:34:04] <wodemaye__> oh ok. :)
[22:34:49] <gf3> wodemaye__: A predicate is a function that returns true or false
[22:35:06] <wodemaye__> what i'm asking is why isn't it el.href.hostname? why can u access hostname without going through href?
[22:35:46] <wodemaye__> if el in fact refers to an object model of an <a> element.
[22:35:47] <gf3> wodemaye__: Because browser vendors are nice and they support our lazy habits
[22:37:40] <wodemaye__> so in native js getElementsByTagName('a')[0].hostname will work as well?
[22:38:05] <wodemaye__> gf3, specification writers probably aren't as nice as browser vendors though, right?
[22:38:25] <gf3> Correct and correct
[22:38:34] <gf3> wodemaye__: You can use el.href if you like
[22:38:53] <gf3> It is technically more correct
[22:38:59] <wodemaye__> i see.  thanks for the great explanations, gf3.
[22:39:06] <gf3> Np
[22:39:39] <wodemaye__> and i hope with gf3 that you go kill yourself right now for that STUPID example, Cork :P
[22:39:59] <wodemaye__> ...<big>JJJJJKKKKK!</big>
[22:40:04] * gf3 kills himself
[22:40:10] <wodemaye__> lol.
[22:40:44] <wodemaye__> anyone hear abt that taiwanese woman who wrote something like that to her fb wall as she was actually committing suicide?
[22:40:54] <wodemaye__> her friends were begging her not to.
[22:43:21] <systemfault> I would probably think about suicide too if I were living in Taiwan..

[22:59:30] <vlad_> hi guys
[23:00:36] <vlad_> i have an app where i have products drawn buy php from database
[23:00:48] <vlad_> i need to make calculation and alter prices on those products
[23:01:03] <wodemaye__> haha hrwath
[23:01:07] <vlad_> is it better to do it with a json array or just some plain jQuery
[23:01:08] <vlad_> 			selectedPrice = parseInt($this.find("h2").text().replace(/[^\d.,]+/,''),10); // put the price of the product in selectedPrice and convert to integer 			selectedName = $this.find("h1").text(); // put the name of the product in selectedName
[23:02:24] <Daniel110> What is the difference between putting jquery in the <head> or the <body> tags?
[23:06:24] <pandersen> hello
[23:07:18] <pandersen> I have a quick question, I have a textarea with a keypress event bound to it, however, the keypress event doesn't trigger when i press "backspace" in the textarea, how can i get this to fire also on backspace?

[23:40:54] <antnash> Hey guys. How do I check if an element has a class containing a certain string?
[23:41:51] <antnash> .hasClass('^match'); ? I acteally meant starting with a string
[23:43:08] <wodemaye__> gf3, why won't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/Zye2k/2/
[23:43:51] <nights> anyone know why my slideDown jerks a bit just when it finishes? looks like the container below collapses 20 pixels or s o up
[23:43:56] <wodemaye__> antnash, maybe $('[class~="string"]')?
[23:51:54] <antnash> wodemaye__: From within a blur handler I need to check if its parent element has a class starting with the string 'joblist', that's why I was thinking a regex match on hasClass. Not possible though?
[23:53:58] <wodemaye__> idk, i'd use an attribute based selector.
[23:55:10] <antnash> wodemaye__: Would I be better setting and using data?
[23:55:25] <wodemaye__> ?faq attribute selector
[23:55:53] <wodemaye__> antnash, i'll bet you could just select based on the class attribute.
