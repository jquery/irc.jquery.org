[00:00:00] <grafi> :P
[00:00:03] <wormmd> True, but then I'd have to wrap the text in <a> tags and style those appropriately, which, while more correct, is annoying.
[00:00:28] <jphase> touché
[00:01:21] <wormmd> Now I need to fix my toggling, but getting the selection right was a big help, thanks!
[00:01:40] <jphase> np
[00:07:09] <Erma> Hi all, I am having trouble with jquery ajax. i could get api response from server and also response is visible in network tab of the inspect element, but parse error is triggering. It is not hiting success function. Please help.
[00:08:20] <jphase> Erma: can you pastebin the code and a sample of the output from your network tab?
[00:08:37] <jphase> preferrably http://paste.ofcode.org ;)
[00:09:01] <Erma> jphase: sure. in 5 min
[00:13:32] <Erma> jphase: Here is the link, Please check http://paste.ofcode.org/UEW5uA8HNf2fyHxc8SD7pb
[00:14:48] <jphase> Erma: looks like you're trying to use the callback=? in there, are you trying to use jsonp or just standard json? And is this request coming from the same domain?
[00:16:11] <jphase> and the response in the network tab just says "true" ?
[00:16:54] <wormmd> Last question for the night: got the toggles working correctly, but now I want the hide effect to finish before the next show effect starts: http://jsfiddle.net/wormmd/zfDaM/6/
[00:17:35] <wormmd> The new div shows up under the old one *just* as it's finishing it's move, then hops up right at the very end.
[00:17:48] <wormmd> Maybe that's an artifact of jsFiddle.
[00:18:19] <Cork> wormmd: animations build a queue per element
[00:18:36] <Cork> so yes you can get overlap if you animate two separate elements
[00:19:00] <wormmd> Is there a way to specify some option like wait: true;?
[00:19:50] <Cork> wormmd: start the second animation from the callback of the first animation
[00:20:05] <wormmd> Ah, right.
[00:22:14] <wormmd> Now I've got my this pointers mixed up :\
[00:23:54] <jphase> do something like    var that = $(this);   before you do your animations
[00:23:59] <Cork> wormmd: http://jsfiddle.net/zfDaM/7/
[00:24:50] <wormmd> You guys are just one step ahead of me, whenever I come back to say I figured it out, you have the answer waiting for me :)
[00:25:15] <wormmd> And that works beautifully. Thank you guys so much.
[00:26:00] <VectorX> i got a <form> i want to be able to do a ajax post of its contents, how would i do that ? so when you press the submit button it needs to compile the data from the form items
[00:26:51] <Cork> $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post(this.action, $(this).serialize()); });
[00:27:17] <Cork> VectorX: ^
[00:28:44] <VectorX> Cork let me give it a spin
[00:29:08] <Erma> jphase: Sorry, i lost connection. Did i miss any reply from you
[00:30:06] <jphase> Erma: is your ajax request a CORS request? (going across domains)?
[00:30:29] <Erma> Erma: yes
[00:31:01] <jphase> Erma: try changing your dataType to jsonp
[00:31:49] <jphase> also make sure you have your access-control-allow-origin set on the remote domain
[00:32:08] <Cork> that isn't needed for jsonp
[00:32:27] <jphase> orly?
[00:32:31] <Cork> the point of jsonp is to work around that specific block
[00:32:49] <Cork> if you set allow-origin and have a browwser that supports it you can request straight json
[00:32:52] <Cork> or html
[00:33:49] <jphase> so jsonp will just ignore that server's setting then and you can request any json data without that set?
[00:34:18] <Cork> jphase: yes, cause it will use <script src=""></script> for cross domain calls
[00:34:23] <Cork> and it doesn't have those blocks
[00:34:31] <jphase> ahh, that makes sense
[00:34:53] <Cork> and that is why you need the function call in the response
[00:35:07] <bluesm_> How it is called the structure like thos
[00:35:08] <bluesm_> this
[00:35:30] <bluesm_> obj1.func1().func2().func3()  ?
[00:35:38] <Cork> chaining
[00:35:59] <Cork> the functions return "this" from the function
[00:36:06] <Cork> so you can chain calls to the object
[00:37:27] <Erma> jphase: Oopz! i lost connection again. Any suggestion  to make it work?
[00:37:38] <Cork> ...
[00:39:40] <jphase> Erma: try changing your dataType to jsonp
[00:40:20] <Erma> jphase: i did that. No luck
[00:40:49] <Cork> Erma: are you sure the server you contact supports jsonp?
[00:42:56] <Erma> Cork: I am not sure. Third party is preparing the server side. How do i know it supports jsonp? I could see Content-type: application/json in Response header in inspect element. Is that it?
[00:43:23] <Cork> Erma: no that is the exact opposite of jsonp
[00:43:38] <Cork> jsonp is text/javascript
[00:44:39] <jphase> I see various posts from umbraco.com where folks aren't successful using jsonp on their domain (http://our.umbraco.org/forum/developers/api-questions/45813-Parse-Error-on-returning-value-from-my-umbraco-web-api-using-JsonP). But who knows?
[00:44:57] <jphase> their jQuery is kinda janky though so idk
[00:45:03] <Cork> and it expects the server to respond with a script file starting with <name the script sent>(json_from_server);
[00:45:31] <Cork> if your response doesn't contain that you can't use jsonp
[00:45:39] <Cork> and need to use json for cross domain calls instead
[00:45:51] <Cork> or proxy it over your domain if you want ie support
[00:50:45] <Erma> Cork: Any suggesstions?
[00:51:03] <jphase> :x
[00:51:06] <Cork> Erma: check the response you get, load the url in a browser and see what you get
[00:55:30] <Erma_> Cork: It works fine in the browser.
[00:55:41] <Cork> Erma_: how is the structure?
[00:55:52] <Cork> does it start with { ?
[00:55:57] <Cork> or [ ?
[00:56:02] <Cork> or is it a function call?
[00:56:08] <Erma_> just a word: true
[00:56:21] <Cork> heh then it doesn't work :)
[00:56:56] <Cork> that would at best be a text response
[00:57:01] <Cork> not jsonp or even json
[00:57:30] <Erma_> Cork: So what do i do
[00:57:31] <Cork> hmm actually, it would be valid json
[00:58:02] <Cork> Erma_: do you expect more then true/false response from that resource?
[00:58:45] <Erma_> Cork: Current api i don't expect another result.
[00:59:07] <Cork> ok, then you are requesting a json resource or text resource
[00:59:13] <Cork> you can't use jsonp
[00:59:25] <Erma_> Cork: I have another api that returns json
[00:59:29] <Cork> and for browsers that doens't support cors you can't do a direct request
[00:59:43] <Cork> Erma_: this resource isn't jsonp
[01:00:07] <Erma_> Cork: How can i make it work?
[01:00:19] <Cork> Erma_: is it ok to not support ie?
[01:01:33] <Erma_> Cork; Internet Explorer?
[01:01:39] <Cork> yes
[01:01:58] <Erma_> Cork: yeah it is ok
[01:02:15] <Cork> hmm wait that might not help
[01:02:57] <Cork> Erma_: if you check the headers in the response do you see Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ?
[01:03:57] <saebekassebil> Hi guys, trying to ask my question here: So I've a button with href=#profile - What I'd like to be able to is to, if the user is not logged in, redirect to the #login page
[01:04:23] <Cork> saebekassebil: you can't redirect #
[01:04:29] <Cork> as there is no network calls
[01:04:36] <saebekassebil> I've thought of somehow intercepting the "pagebeforechange" event, but that is going to be really messy if all my logic is in there
[01:04:46] <saebekassebil> Cork: All my pages are concatenated in held in the DOM onload
[01:04:47] <Cork> ah jqm
[01:04:53] <saebekassebil> Cork: sorry
[01:05:00] <saebekassebil> Cork: yea
[01:06:37] <saebekassebil> is this the right place to ask a such question?
[01:07:49] <Cork> ya, but there isn't very many good with jqm around so you might have to stick around for a while
[01:08:11] <Cork> can't really help you my self cause i don't use jqm
[01:11:40] <VectorX> Cork, with ajax and dataType set to jsonp, how would you get a regular html cross domain page, and not get the pass error ?
[01:12:26] <Cork> VectorX: you can't request pure html over jsonp
[01:12:39] <Cork> jsonp expects a function call in a javascript file
[01:12:46] <VectorX> is there a way to get html then ?
[01:12:51] <Cork> the functions first argument is meant to be the response
[01:13:55] <Cork> <?php echo $_GET['callback']; ?>(<?php echo json_encode(html); ?>);
[01:14:20] <Cork> VectorX: or you have to use a cors enabled browser and set the server to allow it
[01:14:49] <VectorX> well im getting the response, the only problem is the ajax goes to error coz of the convertion
[01:14:54] <VectorX> so how can i use the data
[01:15:02] <Cork> you can't
[01:15:13] <Cork> the browser won't let you have the text data
[01:15:22] <Cork> cause it is cross domain
[01:15:37] <Cork> unless the server explicitly say you my access it
[01:15:47] <VectorX> its showing up in network tab
[01:15:50] <Cork> and the browser knows to check this info :)
[01:16:02] <Cork> VectorX: ya, in privileged code
[01:16:37] <Cork> content code is restricted, and can only access it's own domain unless the server says otherwise
[01:20:40] <soee> hi, i have added 'change' event to few input filed to trigger some action, the 'change' event is assigned to elements with class .foo, now is it possible for of this elements prevent the 'change' event in some situations?
[01:21:39] <Cork> soee: just check the state you want and exit early in the event handler
[01:21:56] <Cork> if(/* check state */) { return; }
[01:23:37] <VectorX> Cork can i not create my own callback to process the data ?
[01:23:52] <Cork> VectorX: you can, but you can't get the data
[01:24:02] <Cork> the browser won't hand it to you
[01:24:24] <Cork> VectorX: jsonp is a hack working around this block
[01:24:56] <Cork> though the limitation is that the server has to send valid a js script with the response
[01:25:09] <Cork> *send a valid js
[01:28:46] <soee> is it possible to assigne some event to variable and use it later, like $(#id).on(foo), $(#id).off(foo) where foo= chnage(function() {}) ?
[01:29:19] <Cork> soee: yes you can store a function reference
[01:29:32] <Cork> soee: though it is normally better to just check the sate in the function
[01:29:36] <Cork> it is less costly
[01:30:02] <Cork> anyway function foo(event) {} $('#id').on(foo); $('#id').off(foo);
[01:30:17] <Cork> opps
[01:30:22] <soee> Cork, but im not sure if i can do what i want the way you suggest
[01:30:24] <Cork> anyway function foo(event) {} $('#id').on('change', foo); $('#id').off(foo);
[01:30:36] <Cork> soee: why not?
[01:31:03] <Cork> opps
[01:31:18] <Cork> off doesn't accept only a function pointer
[01:31:26] <intellix> people using head.js. Is it possible to name an array of files as resources, so I can have head.ready("required", function() {}); and then have non-required files to not hold back the head.ready
[01:31:28] <Cork> so function foo(event) {} $('#id').on('change', foo); $('#id').off('change', foo);
[01:36:19] <Erma> Cork: Sorry I lost connection, Did i miss any reply from you
[01:36:39] <Cork> ... fix your connection
[01:36:49] <Cork> and, not sure depends on what you got
[01:43:54] <Erma> Cork: Last message i got is that, "hmmm wait that might not help"
[01:44:21] <Cork> <Cork> Erma_: if you check the headers in the response do you see Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ?
[01:45:38] <Erma> Yes:
[01:45:53] <Cork> and it includes your domain?
[01:46:24] <Cork> is Content-Type: application/json ?
[01:46:24] <Erma> yes,It says, http://company.localhost
[01:46:38] <Erma> yes,
[01:46:40] <Cork> ok
[01:46:48] <Cork> then set dataType: 'json'
[01:46:53] <Cork> and crossDomain: true
[01:46:59] <Cork> in your ajax call
[01:47:28] <Erma> ok
[01:51:47] <Erma> Cork, still no luck. when i remove callback? from url i get access allow origin error. Does that mean anything?
[01:52:28] <Cork> Erma: so you don't get the access-control-allow-origin if it isn't jsonp?
[01:55:59] <Erma> Cork: that is not what i meant. with dataType: json. I get 200 ok response.
[01:56:57] <Erma> Cork: I also use, callback=? at the end of the url. If i remove that error occurs
[01:57:52] <Cork> Erma: sounds like the server is broken...
[01:58:23] <soee> Corey, do you mind if if prv msg you ?
[01:58:39] <soee> Cork ^
[01:58:55] <Cork> soee: ples don't
[01:59:02] <Cork> *please
[01:59:07] <soee> ok :]
[01:59:40] <Erma> ok, you can msg
[02:00:36] <Erma> Cork: What can i do for that?
[02:01:01] <Cork> Erma: not sure if you can fix it
[02:01:22] <Cork> Erma: btw are you use $.ajax or something else?
[02:02:00] <Erma> Cork: yes, $.ajax
[02:02:16] <Cork> Erma: then i can't help you much more
[02:02:41] <Cork> the server is broken and only way i could possibly get around it would be to hack at it trying to work around it's bugs
[02:03:25] <Erma> Cork, Ok, thanks for your time. Will tell server guys
[02:07:02] <Lurzino> hello everyone
[02:15:10] <Lurzino> I have this line of code: newAddress = myAddress.replace(/(ramp|arterial|highway|street|majorroad|street & highway|arterial & street|street & arterial|majorroad & ramp|ramp & majorroad|major road)/gi, '')
[02:15:26] <Lurzino> with Javascript where I am tryng to find those possibilities of substrings to remove them, but looks like if I have a string like "MajorRoad, via Pincopallino 23 Roma", even if the replace should find the MajorRoad and replace it with '' it doesn't do that, why? is there a better expression to replace those cases? Thanks in advance to all! :-))
[02:16:49] <Cork> js> print("MajorRoad, via Pincopallino 23 Roma".replace(/(ramp|arterial|highway|street|majorroad|street & highway|arterial & street|street & arterial|majorroad & ramp|ramp & majorroad|major road)/gi, ''))
[02:16:54] <b-ot> Cork: , via Pincopallino 23 Roma
[02:16:57] <Erma> Cork: 1 more doubt, server broken means that it is coded badly?
[02:17:09] <Cork> Lurzino: works fine here
[02:17:31] <Cork> Erma: it means it sends json but expects a jsonp request
[02:18:00] <Cork> Erma: unless the callback error comes from js and not the server
[02:18:52] <Erma> Cork: ok
[02:19:08] <Lurzino> Cork here seems sometimes MajorRoad isn't replaced :(
[02:19:23] <Cork> Lurzino: can you provide an example?
[02:19:28] <Cork> jsfiddle.net please
[02:34:34] <regedit> $.ajax(...).done(...); myfunc(); // does it make sense that myfunc() can get called before the ajax has had a chance to be sent off? seems to be the case here in my code... :(
[02:35:09] <grafi> ajax is async
[02:36:28] <regedit> grafi: yes i know, but even just the sending off of the request can also be async?
[02:36:59] <regedit> i thought only after the request has been sent off does the "async"ness kick in
[02:38:27] <regedit> i had understood that sending the request happens immediately synchronously, then execution returns to my code as the request continues to process asynchronously. is this not correct?
[02:39:05] <grafi> sure, but how do you measure the request being made?
[02:40:19] <regedit> grafi: i want to tinker with cookies, send off the request (should have tinkered cookies), then un-tinker the cookies immediately after the request has been successfully sent with the tinkered version
[02:40:59] <grafi> oô
[02:40:59] <regedit> grafi: to my chagrin, my ajax call seems to send the untinkered cookies...
[02:41:46] <regedit> it looks as if the function to untinker() executes before the ajax is sent off, even though the ajax comes first :(
[02:44:26] <trivender> Hello, I need a selector to select all tr not having any radio button checked.Please help
[02:44:46] <Lurzino> Cork: after some little investigation looks like it doesn't work when the address is like: "31824 MajorRoad, 38121 Trento TN'.... what's the parameter to tell the expression to consider everything from start of the address? like: "31824 MajorRoad, 38121 Trento TN' should become just "38121 Trento TN"...
[02:44:54] <grafi> regedit :|
[02:45:15] <Cork> Lurzino: corry can't help you right now
[02:46:29] <grafi> js> print("31824 MajorRoad, 38121 Trento TN".replace(/(ramp|arterial|highway|street|majorroad|street & highway|arterial & street|street & arterial|majorroad & ramp|ramp & majorroad|major road)/gi, ''))
[02:46:35] <b-ot> grafi: 31824 , 38121 Trento TN
[02:47:02] <grafi> so helpful b-ot
[02:48:18] <trivender> I need a selector to select all tr not having any radio button checked.Please help
[02:51:00] <Lurzino> grafi: is there any parameter to expression to tell to replace also whatever is before MajorRoad? I mean from the start of string...
[02:53:42] <grafi> there probably is
[02:58:55] <grafi> js> print("31824 MajorRoad, 38121 Trento TN".replace(/^.*?(ramp|arterial|highway|street|majorroad|street & highway|arterial & street|street & arterial|majorroad & ramp|ramp & majorroad|major road)/gi, ''))

[03:05:20] <neworder> Hi guys
[03:05:44] <neworder> What does this statement mean?       $('ul', this).toggle("slow");
[03:06:01] <neworder> What's the significance of this in the function
[03:06:22] <doebi> when using the autocomplete mehod from ui, can i limit user input to predefined values?
[03:06:28] <neworder> $('ul', this)
[03:06:45] <doebi> so it's like a select, just with search functionality
[03:08:02] <seutje> doebi: just give it an array as source
[03:08:14] <seutje> that's actually the example used for "default functionality"
[03:08:21] <seutje> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#default
[03:09:37] <GreatPotato> neworder: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#selector-context
[03:10:02] <GreatPotato> Basically will get all UL's in that context
[03:10:49] <neworder> Thanks!
[03:11:28] <trivender> @codepiper , I am able to select table rows , now I want to apply filter . Means I need only those rows not having checked radio decendent

[03:19:04] <rj11> Is it possible to initiate a drag of a draggable programmatically? I have a <div> containing draggables, but the draggable are too small to be touched on a device such as iPad. I want to initiate the drag of the last child div when their parent is clicked.
[03:21:35] <CodesStuff> rj11: use :last in your selector?
[03:21:57] <CodesStuff> so like... $('.draggable>div:last')
[03:21:59] <CodesStuff> i think
[03:22:08] <CodesStuff> ?jsfiddle
[03:22:12] <trivender> @seutje, thats great:) you are so helpful..that work perfectly
[03:22:21] <CodesStuff> .jsfiddle
[03:22:28] <CodesStuff> bot-t, where are you? :[
[03:25:06] <rj11> CodesStuff: Yes, :last or .last() works and gives me the last child, but, I don't know how to actually initiate the drag.
[03:26:15] <rj11> CodesStuff: It's the smaller divs inside the parent div that are draggable. But they're too small to touch easily on an iPad. So I want to drag the last child div when the parent div is clicked/dragged instead.
[03:26:56] <shwaiil> Hi
[03:29:03] <shwaiil> Q: I've got a render bug in my browser. So, I'm loading a page in one browser tab, this is a SPA, so when the data is returned async they're placed in a list one by one bringing them from opacity 0 to opacity 1, with CSS 3 transition. The problem is, if I switch Browser tab, and come back to that browser tab where that content is being loaded. It doesn't work. I wonder why ? Thanks!
[03:33:37] <rj11> CodesStuff: http://jsfiddle.net/Gqyrk/
[03:34:15] <rj11> CodesStuff: That works fine, but those smaller dots are too small to touch on an iPad. I want the user to be able to click and drag anywhere within the larger box to move the last small box, (marked red).
[04:03:26] <usc911> hey guys, whats the best way to go about adding a class to a clicked link then saving it even when the page is refreshed? cheers
[04:04:02] <rue> Saving it… to the library of congress?
[04:04:16] <LeBlaaanc> badumpchaaa
[04:04:32] <usc911> pew pew
[04:04:45] <rue> usc911: You have to put it into storage somewhere though
[04:05:06] <LeBlaaanc> (or don't refresh the page)
[04:05:10] <rue> Or that
[04:06:46] <usc911> the page is probably going to be refreshed
[04:06:47] <rue> You /can/ just stick stuff in localStorage, but it kinda seems iffy.
[04:07:29] <usc911> agreed, or a cookie, I think thats probably going to be the best way
[04:07:33] <rue> Actually, can you select :visited? That may not work for all use cases anyway
[04:07:43] <rue> This depends a little on what the semantics are
[04:10:59] <LeBlaaanc> seems iffy.
[04:23:05] <Lurzino> if I want to replace "Street &" with "" is it enough .replace(/^.*?(street &)\,/gi, ''); ?
[04:23:17] <Lurzino> or shall I have to put \& in the regex?
[04:37:04] <traplin> i have the methods do_job_cleaner and do_job_carguard, now how, when i start the do_job_cleaner, do i stop the do_job_carguard method?

[04:54:53] <_rgn> data.myList
[04:55:08] <Ankhwatcher> ah, cool
[04:55:40] <_rgn> and to be accurate, it's not json anymore at that point. it's an object and you can examine with console.log(data)
[04:55:59] <Ankhwatcher> is there a test to see if it's there or should I null test?
[04:57:07] <_rgn> if ('myList' in data) { ...
[04:57:53] <Ankhwatcher> excellent
[04:57:57] <Ankhwatcher> thanks
[05:14:46] <zquad> GENTLEMENT: horror here: http://pastebin.com/dsZXbzLr   why is it that the object exists on line 9 but undefined on line 16?
[05:17:03] <seutje> zquad: ur returning from an each
[05:17:09] <zquad> yes
[05:17:19] <zquad> so waht?
[05:17:22] <seutje> that doesn't go anywhere
[05:17:34] <zquad> hmmm so how do I get the object?
[05:17:38] <zquad> should I clone it?
[05:18:12] <seutje> http://pastebin.com/b5gQE67u
[05:18:38] <zquad> oooooooooooooohhhhh
[05:18:40] <zquad> thanks
[05:19:01] <seutje> create a variable outside the async scope and set it from within the async scope, then return it from the wrapping function
[05:19:24] <seutje> there's other solutions, but I think this one is simplest for this use case
[05:19:43] <zquad> yup I am going with yours
[05:19:44] <zquad> thanks
[05:23:13] <sahbeewah> you can replicate break functionality inside an each loop by using return false; fyi
[05:35:53] <kpl> I have an .on('valuechanged', function (event) {    How can I disable this preliminary if I'd like to change the value without triggering the function?
[05:36:29] <Cork> kpl: have a check in the function and exit the function if you don't want to do something
[05:36:37] <Cork> kpl: you can't disable an event listener
[05:36:53] <kpl> OK, thanks
[05:45:38] <nardev> hello
[06:11:21] <zquad> I have a UTC datetime how do I convert it to the browser's native datetime?
[06:14:57] <Cork> js> print((new Date('2011-12-13T12:00:00Z')).toString())
[06:15:02] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[06:15:09] <Cork> js> print((new Date('2011-12-13T12:00:00 UTC')).toString())
[06:15:14] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[06:15:17] <Cork> hmm
[06:15:30] <Cork> js> print((new Date('2011-12-13T12:00:00+0000')).toString())
[06:15:35] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[06:15:37] <Cork> bah
[06:15:38] <zquad> :)
[06:15:55] <zquad> so the browser will automatically convert that to the local datetime?
[06:16:00] <Cork> i just love that different engines support different date formats
[06:16:04] <Cork> yes
[06:16:09] <zquad> aaaaaah
[06:16:23] <zquad> while we're at it
[06:16:29] <Cork> unless you explicitly ask the browser to give you utc
[06:17:05] <zquad> I need to format it: at 4:40 PM, Wed 15th Dec
[06:17:13] <zquad> :)
[06:18:40] <Cork> zquad: you would have to use a date formatting lib
[06:18:53] <zquad> any suggestions?
[06:18:54] <Cork> it isn't supported naively by browsers
[06:19:06] <zquad> jquery must have something no?
[06:20:12] <Cork> zquad: you could give http://momentjs.com/ a try
[06:21:36] <zquad> llooks like it might work
[06:21:38] <zquad> thanks Cork
[06:30:39] <zquad> Cork: how did you find that website so fast?  Did you already know about it?
[06:30:56] <Cork> zquad: google is your friend :)
[06:31:04] <zquad> :)
[06:31:32] <Cork> well the engine is at least
[06:41:39] <jop008> Goodafternoon. I have a date plugin using jqMobile with several problems what is a good plugin to choose for FFox usage the native one on Chrome/webkit is fine
[06:47:27] <Ankhwatcher> Hey I'm trying to select a tag within a html object I have retrieved using get() http://pastebin.com/JAmLjvP0 what call will do that for me?
[06:47:53] <NielsNL> can someone help with the following issue please. I want to dynamically create a jqueryUI Menu that should be shown after clicking a tool button.
[06:47:53] <NielsNL> All is create correctly except when i press the toolbutton the menu is shown empty. the menuitems are hidden.
[06:47:53] <NielsNL> here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/tr62T/3/
[06:50:16] <NielsNL> Ankhwatcher: where is that "item." coming from?
[06:51:38] <Ankhwatcher> NielsNL: here: http://pastebin.com/V1qmtgL3
[06:52:02] <Ankhwatcher> it's not a problem, the problem is "var image = listItem.children("#image");"
[06:52:23] <Ankhwatcher> I know that's wrong, but I can't find the right sintax
[06:52:29] <Cork> Ankhwatcher: listItem is text you can't run children on it
[06:53:02] <Ankhwatcher> ? Why is it text?
[06:53:18] <Cork> Ankhwatcher:cause it haven't been parsed
[06:53:29] <Cork> Ankhwatcher: what version of jquery?
[06:53:36] <Ankhwatcher> ah
[06:53:37] <Ankhwatcher> ah
[06:53:57] <Ankhwatcher> so I need to call parse on it and do my work in that callback
[06:54:01] <Cork> you want $(html) or $($.parseHTML(html)) depending on version
[06:54:13] <Cork> and store the dom version of that function
[06:54:17] <Ankhwatcher> I
[06:54:21] <Cork> then append the updated dom
[06:54:23] <Ankhwatcher> 'm using 2.0.0
[06:54:55] <Cork> var listItem = $($.parseHTML(html)) listItem.children('').css(); list.append(listItem); then
[06:55:24] <Ankhwatcher> cool
[06:55:34] <Ankhwatcher> so children was right and everything else was wrong
[06:55:46] <Ankhwatcher> is there a getHTML() which would do some of this for me?
[06:56:11] <Cork> Ankhwatcher: well you most likely want find instead of children
[06:56:36] <Cork> Ankhwatcher: no you always need to parse it your self
[06:56:46] <dewdrop> Hi, a simple question, how do I get tet from the 3rd div of a particular class. I am familiar with .somelcass:first .somelcass:last, but how do I get text from a specific div?
[06:56:47] <Cork> cause you don't always want to parse it to dom
[06:56:49] <Ankhwatcher> yeah I tried find, but it didn't work for probably the same reason
[06:57:34] <Cork> dewdrop: $('.someclass').eq(2)
[06:59:19] <NielsNL> Cork: do you also have an answer for my issue with the menu Widgets ?
[06:59:57] <dewdrop> Cork: Thanks
[07:00:17] <Cork> NielsNL: i would prob make it static just hidden
[07:00:27] <Cork> and move the html back into the html file
[07:01:49] <NielsNL> it is part of a datatable view where the button etc is shown when a row is selected.
[07:02:07] <NielsNL> and removed when the row s deselected.
[07:03:18] <NielsNL> btw when it is static as you mantioned above the popup menu works fine.
[07:03:46] <NielsNL> But not when it is dynamically created
[07:05:04] <Cork> NielsNL: i can't see anything wrong with what is there except one thing
[07:05:10] <Cork> height and width takes numbers no strings
[07:05:13] <Cork> and it is always px
[07:05:50] <jop008> Wrere can I found documnentation on this plug in? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/experiments/ui-datepicker/
[07:06:03] <jop008> I want to chnage the format and translation stuf
[07:06:43] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[07:06:49] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[07:07:11] <NielsNL> Cork: you mean the once setting the width and height of the button?
[07:07:19] <Cork> yes
[07:07:23] <ph88> how can i check if jQuery selector has been placed in the dom ?
[07:07:29] <Cork> and i think i have an idea for the menu too
[07:07:43] <BillCriswell> ph88: You can check the length on it.
[07:07:52] <BillCriswell> $('.doesNotExist').length will return 0.
[07:08:01] <ph88> ok thx BillCriswell
[07:08:53] <Bloomberg> Someone here has worked with fancybox plugin?
[07:09:37] <Cork> NielsNL: not sure why but the mdata gets display: none
[07:09:46] <Cork> and can't see anytjhing in the code that adds that
[07:09:53] <NielsNL> yeah that's what i see too
[07:10:45] <NielsNL> btw i tried to add more menu items but that did not fixed it.
[07:11:04] <Cork> NielsNL: are you sure your suppose to have that dive around it?
[07:11:12] <Cork> *div
[07:11:40] <NielsNL> no but that was used in the examples on jqueryUI
[07:12:12] <Cork> no it's not
[07:12:18] <antihero> argh, datepicker issues
[07:12:32] <antihero> $otherDates = $('#id_service-date, #id_burial-date, #id_after-date'); $otherDates.datepicker( "option", "minDate", '0');
[07:12:35] <antihero> yet this does not work
[07:12:36] <Cork> NielsNL: <ul id="menu"><li></li></ul> is the structure they use there
[07:12:45] <NielsNL> ha ye you are right, i try that
[07:13:01] <NielsNL> my mistake
[07:13:34] <Cork> antihero: datepicker takes an object with prefs
[07:13:41] <Cork> not a list with arguments
[07:13:57] <antihero> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-option
[07:14:01] <Cork> oh, wait your updating it later
[07:14:16] <antihero> yeah
[07:14:25] <Cork> antihero: and "minDate", 0) ?
[07:16:06] <antihero> no joy
[07:16:21] <NielsNL> cork: thanks that was the issue :D
[07:17:48] * hlve slaps cork around a bit with a large trout
[07:18:58] <antihero> hmm, perhaps jQuery/UI needs update
[07:24:10] <antihero> nope, still buggered :(
[07:27:28] <alex908> can someone tell me how i can get infinite scroll to work on this page http://alexandrabunny908.tumblr.com/page/2
[07:29:37] <oste> anyone know of an open source variety of something like one of these...
[07:29:41] <oste> http://codecanyon.net/item/boutique-carousel/full_screen_preview/113093

[07:35:37] <yaw> how do I deal with jsonp ajax response. I get error complaining of :
[07:35:48] <zquad> Cork
[07:35:52] <zquad> awake?
[07:36:55] <zquad> I have data that I associate with an element so that I can do something like $(element).attr("data") send ajax.  What is the best practice for adding data to elements?
[07:37:23] <hlve> i hate jqwidgets more than anything in this world
[07:37:33] <hlve> fucking terrible framework.
[07:37:35] <zquad> in other words is Should I have <li data="fancy data here"></li> ???? a good idea?
[07:38:57] <ph88> Anyone an idea how i can do this ?  http://jsfiddle.net/5MhvW/  (question in CSS field)
[07:39:30] <ph88> height should be like 20px , not 200px
[07:43:22] <Ankhwatcher> oh hey StackOverflow is down
[07:44:03] <Velveeta> expertsexchange.com: "hi, i'm the owner of stackoverflow, and my site is down, where should i check first for the problem?"
[07:44:06] <Happzz> hey
[07:44:09] <Happzz> $('button[data-state]').on('click', function(event) { });
[07:44:10] <hlve> lol
[07:44:19] <Happzz> how do i make this act like .live()
[07:44:28] <Ankhwatcher> ExpertSexChange?
[07:44:30] <Happzz> so it will bind to new elements that appear on the page after it's loaded
[07:44:54] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher: i've always loved that interpretation of the name :D
[07:45:24] <Velveeta> hlve: is your problem with the existing jquery ui widget offerings, or with the framework they're built upon?
[07:45:42] <Velveeta> happzz: use .on : http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:45:54] <xec> he is..
[07:46:02] <Ankhwatcher> moving on, my mutable object is changing before my callbacks can use it, how can make sure the callbacks get the same value it starts with?
[07:46:03] <Velveeta> happzz: $(document).on('click', 'button[data-state]', function(event) {});
[07:46:12] <Happzz> Velveeta it's what i used o_O
[07:46:20] <Velveeta> xec: good point, i should have said use .on in a different way :D
[07:46:40] <xec> Happzz: read http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[07:47:39] <Happzz> xec i just did. i don't see how this is related?
[07:47:41] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher: do you have multiple callbacks, some of which are applying changes before other callbacks can deal with the original object state, or what's going on?
[07:47:57] <Velveeta> happzz: i posted a sample of how you should be using it up above
[07:48:07] <xec> Happzz: there are two different syntax examples at the end of that paragraph
[07:48:17] <Happzz> i see. thanks.
[07:48:39] <Happzz> i guess the manual should've been more clear about this
[07:48:42] <Ankhwatcher> i'm firing N callbacks in a loop, but the loop that's creating the callbacks is changing the variable they reference
[07:49:27] <xec> Ankhwatcher: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide55
[07:49:54] <Velveeta> happzz: from the .on page: "For help in converting from older jQuery event methods, see .bind(),  .delegate(), and .live()." … from the live page: "$( document ).on( events, selector, data, handler );" … i don't know that it can get more clear than that :D
[07:50:16] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher: do you have access to change the structure of that loop, or is it 3rd party code?
[07:50:45] <Happzz> Velveeta it's a fact i kind of know what i'm doing
[07:50:48] <Happzz> not an expert but still
[07:50:52] <Happzz> and i couldn't figure it out from the manual
[07:50:56] <Ankhwatcher> xec: nice
[07:51:11] <Velveeta> happzz: no problem, that's what we're here for, i was just pointing that out to you :)
[07:51:21] <Ankhwatcher> no no, it's all my stuff I think xec may hav solved it for me
[07:51:47] <Happzz> thanks for your help, Velveeta
[07:51:54] <hlve> someone kill jqwidgets
[07:51:55] <hlve> like
[07:51:56] <hlve> now
[07:52:17] <Velveeta> hlve: again, what's your problem with jqwidgets? the widgets themselves or the framework (factory) they're built upon?
[07:53:24] <hlve> the widgets themselves. they're a nightmare to develop with
[07:53:42] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher: just be aware that if you're using a construct similar to that slide, within the click handler, the 'i' reference is going to equal whatever it equals at the end of the loop, not what it equaled during that particular iteration of the loop where your click handler was attached
[07:54:28] <Velveeta> hlve: i will admit that they're a bit sloppy internally, we don't use a lot of them at my company, we have our own widget library built on top of the factory itself… but we do use some standard ones like dialog
[07:54:48] <Velveeta> and draggable/droppable/sortable, but only in limited places
[07:55:07] <Velveeta> and the position widget :D i guess we do use a few of them
[07:56:38] <hlve> I just HATE the fact that one of our clients refuses to disband them.
[07:56:45] <hlve> the stupid checkboxes in the grids have been the death of me.
[07:56:46] <hlve> really.
[07:57:01] <Velveeta> ahhh yes, we don't use their grid implementation, we have our own
[07:57:18] <hlve> smart.
[07:57:25] <xec> is the jquery ui grid released?
[07:58:03] <hlve> the stupid grid checkboxes by default are adding a title of 'true' for checked, and 'false' for unchecked. and any attempt in removing the titles from them has been a nightmare.
[07:58:28] <Velveeta> gross
[07:58:33] <hlve> it's SO dumb.
[07:58:56] <hlve> I've gotten it on render to remove the titles, but after a checkbox is checked, it just readds it.
[07:58:58] <hlve> Stupid.
[07:59:00] <xec> oh nevermind, i thought you were referring to the widgets part of jquery ui when you said "jqwidgets"
[07:59:11] <hlve> xec, no jqw
[07:59:13] <xec> but it's a whole other beast
[07:59:52] <Bloomberg> Guys who has worked with fancybox?
[08:00:04] <xec> hlve: you mean jqx?
[08:00:39] <Velveeta> ahhhhh ok, i thought you were talking about jquery ui also
[08:01:03] <Velveeta> in that case, i can feel comfortable in adding my voice to your distress call for somebody to kill jqwidgets
[08:03:39] <hlve> =)
[08:03:56] <hlve> xec, that's what I meant. That. It needs to die.
[08:04:13] <kpl> Can a UI tab be made vertical, instead of horizontal, as shown in the example at http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/ ?
[08:04:41] <xec> hlve: noted :)
[08:05:22] <hlve> why would you want a vertical tab? :o
[08:05:42] <xec> kpl: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#vertical
[08:07:09] <kpl> xec: thanks. So it's a matter of styling it seems.
[08:07:23] <xec> kpl: indeed
[08:07:48] <Ankhwatcher> my callbacks are executing out of order and thus appending to my ListView out of order, can I specify where they should be placed?
[08:08:09] <xec> (said in the voice of Christopher Judge)
[08:09:57] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[08:10:00] <hlve> Bloomberg!!
[08:10:54] <Bloomberg> How can I to call an internal script wich will modify the tables automatically but doesn't will return results
[08:10:55] <Bloomberg> ?
[08:11:34] <hlve> what
[08:11:35] <hlve> lol
[08:11:40] <Bloomberg> For example :: Always I do ::  $.post('My_url', function(data){alert(data)});
[08:11:43] <NoiseEee> internal script?  what tables?
[08:11:53] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher: for something like that, you'd probably want to add each element to an object that's keyed numerically, and then iterate over it when they're all done, and push each one into an array for insertion or something
[08:11:59] <hlve> i'm so lost.
[08:12:51] <Ankhwatcher> okay that sounds like a good idea, so I create a map
[08:14:20] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: wat
[08:15:22] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher: right, i would advocate creating it directly in an array, except that you can't define indexes out of order like you can with an object map :)
[08:16:14] <Velveeta> and also you could iterate over the object numerically and append each element as you encountered it, but depending on the number of elements in question, that'd be inefficient on the DOM, whereas you can push them into an array in the proper order, wrap that in a jquery initializer, and appendTo your element all at once
[08:16:24] <Ankhwatcher> how do I know when all the callbacks are done?
[08:16:32] <xec> Ankhwatcher: i'm not 100% sure, but maybe you can use deferreds for this, does this look relevant? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13651243
[08:16:51] <Velveeta> xec: i was just about to recommend deferreds ;)
[08:17:05] * xec high fives Velveeta
[08:17:45] <Velveeta> ankhwatcher you can create a deferred per callback that you create in your loop, and assign it to an external array, then pass the array to $.when with $.when.apply(this, deferredArray).done(functionToInsertYourNodes)
[08:17:59] <Velveeta> and within each callback, resolve its respective deferred object in that array
[08:18:11] <Velveeta> when they're all complete, it'll trigger the deferred created from your $.when call
[08:19:04] <BillCriswell> O
[08:19:05] <BillCriswell> O
[08:19:09] <Velveeta> O
[08:19:20] <BillCriswell> I'll never understand noobies obsessions with regular expressions.
[08:19:27] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: New keyboard. ='(
[08:19:29] <Velveeta> i love regular expressions :D
[08:19:51] <xec> BillCriswell: they are like black magic!
[08:20:09] <xec> everyone loves magic
[08:20:30] <Velveeta> i mean what's more fun? myVar.substring(0, 1) or myVar.REGEXPPOWER(/^./)[0]
[08:20:37] <BillCriswell> It's ok since you know what you're doing with them haha. I see too many stackoverflow questions where a simple .split() can get you to what you need 50 times faster.
[08:20:48] <Velveeta> ahhhhhh yes
[08:21:09] <BillCriswell> and they really request "regex only".
[08:21:13] <Velveeta> i also love it when newbies try to micro-optimize their code
[08:21:21] <xec> it's the nail/hammer syndrome
[08:21:37] <Velveeta> you'll see crap like this: var sentence = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sentence'].join(' ');
[08:21:39] <BillCriswell> What's faster: "Foo" or 'Foo' in php?
[08:21:48] <Velveeta> billcriswell: 'Foo' !
[08:21:57] <xec> lol
[08:22:03] <Velveeta> my single quotes preference in js is a holdover from php actually :D
[08:22:12] <Velveeta> it doesn't matter at all in js, but i still use them primarily
[08:22:29] <xec> i think you just fell in bill's cunning trap
[08:22:47] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha I know it's ' as well but in all honesty it will only matter like 1 in a billion times?
[08:22:49] <Velveeta> well it's true, single quotes don't have to be parsed for embedded variables in php :D
[08:23:03] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah. I think single quotes are nicer to look at.
[08:23:04] <esmic> nub question: i have several values connected to 1 <option> value how can i represent them
[08:23:24] <Velveeta> billcriswell: right, i adopted it as a pattern just because it was minimally intrusive, using 1 quote consistently vs another, as opposed to concatenating arrays of words or something stupid like that :D
[08:23:45] <Velveeta> esmic: as in, 1 single option is supposed to be representative of a whole set of values?
[08:23:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Indeedie.
[08:24:34] <Velveeta> esmic: you can try delimiting them, comma- or pipe-delimiting or something, you'd just have to know that you need to split the value string into multiple pieces on that delimiter when you were using those multiple values
[08:25:49] <BillCriswell> My hair is getting way too long. There's times I think it looks awesome but I think most of the time it just looks terrible.
[08:26:23] <Velveeta> mine was down to my waist for the better part of 20 years before i cut it a few months ago
[08:26:28] <andywww> I'm having some problems communicating with multiple instances of a simple plugin, i wondered if someone could have a quick look and let me know what i'm doing wrong
[08:26:32] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9eda87c223fe17a54934
[08:26:47] <andywww> i want both instances to fire the resize function on window resize
[08:27:05] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Mine is barely passed my ears.
[08:27:24] <BillCriswell> The longest it's been since junior high easily.
[08:28:34] <Velveeta> andywww: you're declaring the resize function internally to the plugin, making it private… you can't access it from the global scope the way you're trying to call it there
[08:28:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19686699/regex-to-grab-from-char-string-to-another/19686741 Getting downvoted on this because I suggested a way to avoid the regex hah.

[08:30:01] <oste> or this http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-carousel-evolution/full_screen_preview/490018
[08:30:51] <xec> lol BillCriswell, you got a sympathy upvote from me to get you back to 0 ^^
[08:33:23] <xec> we should just downvote everyone else with a commen saying "-1 for using regex"
[08:33:34] <xec> comment*
[08:33:36] <andywww> Velveeta: it seems to be working but only on the last instance of the plugin
[08:34:14] <BillCriswell> xec: Haha. The internet might be more fun if I was a jerk.
[08:39:14] <bberry> hey guys.... using this select2 library and cant figure out why this isnt working. seems pretty simple. http://jsfiddle.net/WKX2R/
[08:39:27] <bberry> heres a link to the select2 lib
[08:39:27] <bberry> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[08:40:45] <bberry> wait. could be bc no style sheet...
[08:41:22] <xec> bberry: you're linking to a html page as if it was a script
[08:41:35] <bberry> aha that too
[08:42:51] <xec> and afaik github doesn't allow hotlinking raw files any more
[08:42:58] <bberry> yeah i just ran into that
[08:43:00] <bberry> that sucks
[08:44:02] <bberry> and i dont suppose doing like <script src="url/to/file.js"> would work either?
[08:45:35] <xec> bberry: that's what the external resources option does for you
[08:45:51] <xec> bberry: google for "cdn select2", might be some cdn hosting it
[08:47:07] <bberry> cool

[09:04:57] <andywww> how do you talk to all instances of a plugin on a pae?
[09:04:59] <andywww> page?
[09:09:09] <frothnicator> Pardon this Python born programmer: I'm looking for the concept of a property as an automatic function call.  Does jQuery or Javascript have something like this?
[09:09:18] <frothnicator> For example, say I have a Person object with two attributes ('first', 'last') and an instance, p1.  I'd like p1.name to return something like 'last, first', such that p1.name automatically follows changes to .first and .last.
[09:09:41] <frothnicator> Example: var p1 = Person({first: 'Larry', last: 'Lessig'}); console.log( p1.name ).  p1.set({first: 'Lawrence'}); console.log( p1.name).  I'd like the first .name to return '..., Larry', and the second .name to return '..., Lawrence.
[09:10:15] <xec> frothnicator: you could just make a method instead. (you could do this with a getter, but not wide support afaik)
[09:10:16] <frothnicator> note the lack of function call parentheses () to .name
[09:10:39] <frothnicator> xec: heh, so, basically, I need the function call?
[09:11:02] <xec> yep, depending on what browser support you need of course
[09:11:12] <jop008> Good tip localization date picker!
[09:11:17] <frothnicator> not IE, but Chrome and Fearfox.
[09:11:54] <xec> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Defining_getters_and_setters
[09:12:09] <frothnicator> xec: roger, thanks for the link.  Reading now ...
[09:12:29] <xec> any reason you don't want a method btw?
[09:13:19] <xec> just curious, other than when working with knockout.js i haven't really had the need for getters or setters
[09:14:52] <frothnicator> xec: looks "prettier" to my mind, in that I want folks to think of the name as property rather than a function.  Or, put differently, none other than my stubborness.  But that link appears to syntactically do what  I want, so thanks.
[09:17:10] <xec> looks like the support is better than i thought, ie9 and up
[09:17:58] <xec> http://robertnyman.com/javascript/javascript-getters-setters.html#regular-getters-and-setters
[09:18:23] <frothnicator> xec: I'm in the unique position that I don't care what IE supports because I don't have to support it for this project.  :-)  (But good to note for future reference.)
[09:22:59] <alainus> How do I find out what script is adding a particular attibute to my elements through the console? I tried the Event Listeners Breakpoints (on DOM Mutation) but it doesn't catch it.

[09:27:05] <Bloomberg> sdf
[09:27:54] <Cork> nhulea: you need to store the old value if you want it
[09:28:06] <nhulea> awesome like cache
[09:28:09] <nhulea> Cor
[09:29:35] <ortund> can anyone tell me what I should google to find how to make a div anchor to the top of the browser window while scrolling?
[09:29:51] <Cork> ortund: sticky
[09:30:00] <Cork> sticky headers is prob a good example
[09:30:10] <Ankhwatcher> okay I'm back from lunch and back to deferring functions
[09:30:13] <Cork> ortund: if you just want it to always be there use position: fixed;
[09:30:18] <nhulea> Cork: if found this jQuery.data()
[09:30:34] <Cork> nhulea: ya, that is a good place to store the old value
[09:31:16] <ortund> Cork my idea was to have the div anchor when the user scrolls past it
[09:31:25] <Cork> nhulea: $(document).on('input change', function() { $(this).data('odl-value', $(this).val()); });
[09:31:35] <Cork> ortund: ya, that is sticky

[09:36:00] <aro> is there a way with autocomplete to filter the previous results?
[09:36:17] <aro> like if i search '1', and it returns 12, 13, 14, 141, 15, etc
[09:36:32] <aro> if i type '14' can it filter the results it previously had?
[09:37:39] <aro> kind of like cache the previous results, and search them
[09:49:34] <NoiseEee> aro: but wouldn't those 'previous results' still be filterable/findable with the entire autocomplete list?
[09:50:54] <kittonian> hi all
[09:51:21] <kittonian> i'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to use the corner plugin - http://jquery.malsup.com/corner/
[09:52:10] <BillCriswell> kittonian: What type of border are you shooting for?
[09:52:13] <kittonian> I have all the same js files being called in the head section and i keep pouring through the source on their demo page to no avail. none of my corners are being rounded on IE but their page works perfectly.
[09:52:43] <kittonian> just the standard round corners with a specific px radius. everything works fine on FF and Safari, but I'm trying to make it work on IE as well
[09:53:04] <kittonian> just can't figure out how to call to the script properly. they don't seem to ever be calling to it in their source
[09:53:12] <snover> kittonian: stop. use css3pie. or just don’t care.
[09:53:19] <Ankhwatcher> Hey, I'd like to refactor my code out into a function like so: http://pastebin.com/3a5Hpix0 How can I make this return resultMap once it has all of it's entries?
[09:53:23] <Ankhwatcher> thanks
[09:53:54] <BillCriswell> kittonian: just doing border-radius: 10px; will work IE9 and up, and ass snover suggested you can use css3pie to make it work in IE8.
[09:54:05] <alex2234> I need to find the length of a div, but the markup gets added AFTER the dom is loaded.. how can i query this?
[09:55:34] <silentboy> @alex: Just make sure that div is loaded before your js code
[09:56:45] <kittonian> trying css3pie now. never knew it existed
[10:01:00] <BillCriswell> kittonian: It'll save many headaches.
[10:01:03] <BillCriswell> Much like real pie.
[10:04:44] <kittonian> ha!
[10:05:36] <kittonian> well, it definitely works pretty well. i'm still getting the background color hard edges but the border is rounded properly. thanks so much for the advice.
[10:06:40] <Ankhwatcher> how can I get the number of items in a map?
[10:09:28] <bl4ckdu5t> I was working with a web project built half way by another developer and it used CDNs for it's CSS also

[10:09:35] <bl4ckdu5t> <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.min.css" />
[10:10:00] <bl4ckdu5t> Is there a way to use a fallback this way like we do with jquery CDN
[10:10:03] <bl4ckdu5t> ??
[10:18:06] <ortund> Cork, no errors, but I don't see the div sticking to the top anywhere, yet the code works fine in jsfiddle... http://jsfiddle.net/VMM9T/1/

[10:29:34] <Cork> ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/VMM9T/2/
[10:30:12] <Cork> ortund: you might want to add a placeholder on the old position of the element so the page content doesn't jump

[10:35:03] <Scroll_Tro0L> Hello!
[10:36:40] <Scroll_Tro0L> I've got a website that loads every page via ajax. I'm having some problems with submitting forms though. Is there a way for me to pass form data even when the page reloads?
[10:40:53] <ortund> Thanks Cork, will give it a try
[10:41:44] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: you could try onunload
[10:41:49] <Cork> with a sync ajax call
[10:41:59] <Cork> though... it isn't the best of solution
[10:42:00] <Cork> +s
[10:42:28] <Scroll_Tro0L> Corey, Would an ajax submission be better?
[10:42:49] <Scroll_Tro0L> I've been trying to get the plugin to work but I can't :|
[10:47:13] <ortund> Cork, the clone of the div is visible when I'm at the top of the page... tempted to set .css("display", "none") by default
[10:47:29] <soahccc> Hey guys. I already have a pygmentized output for my code but I would like to add line numbers + raw/copy mode. Does anyone know a plugin which would optimally work with bootstrap 2?
[10:49:21] <Cork> ortund: see the extra css i added
[10:49:24] <garrilla> anyone help? I'm trying to load a highcharts chart... getting a TypeError "highcharts is not a function" - all the frameworks are loading - I can trigger my function from the console... same error http://pastebin.com/sJvMuKkX
[10:49:26] <Cork> and the change to .sticky
[10:49:55] <ortund> derp... figured I'd missed something
[10:50:08] <esmic> can i add/subtract from 2 different divs to a third
[10:50:12] <Cork> garrilla: don't define plugins in ready
[10:50:31] <Cork> garrilla: you want them to always be defined BEFORE ready fires, else it might be too late
[10:50:51] <Cork> esmic: please elaborate
[10:52:39] <jop008> I have an icon I use this <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.ico"> to show it but no icon?
[10:52:53] <jop008> Is it browser dependent? Settings needed?
[10:53:23] <garrilla> cork, like so?  http://pastebin.com/1bpGeqNa
[10:53:50] <Cork> garrilla: you had  $.fn.buildHighCharts = function() { <-- in ready
[10:54:11] <Cork> that should be outside ready and the call to that plugin should happen in ready
[10:54:56] <ortund> :( Cork, still isn't working -> http://loganyoung.za.net/software/articles/forms-authentication-in-asp-net/
[10:54:57] <garrilla> cork, yes, that's what I changed in the pastebin ?
[10:57:14] <Cork> ortund: btw <a href"=/info.php">
[10:57:27] <Cork> ortund: looks like you should do it another way
[11:02:45] <Cork> ortund: try this instead http://jsfiddle.net/VMM9T/4/
[11:05:18] <garrilla> cork, would you like this ? the function is outside of the ready http://pastebin.com/1bpGeqNa
[11:06:23] <Cork> garrilla: creating a function and moving the code out of ready like that is pointless
[11:06:32] <Cork> plugins though should be outside ready
[11:06:45] <Cork> meaning things that do $.fn.<function name> = function
[11:07:03] <ortund> still no luck... damn :/
[11:07:15] <jop008> i use <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="favicon.ico"> to show my favicon in Safari I can see it but not in chrome /FF
[11:07:16] <ortund> I should really be doing this on my dev env
[11:07:29] <garrilla> cork, thanks but i'm confused
[11:07:34] <Cork> ortund: looks like you have the hiding code left
[11:08:11] <Cork> garrilla: definitions should be outside ready, just code you want to run can be inside without a problem
[11:09:12] <Cork> jop008: facicon.ico should be loaded by default from the root without the need to specify anything in the header
[11:09:24] <garrilla> cork, OK, I thoght that is what I had changed... I created a stand alone function. Then in the ready statement, I called the function.
[11:10:03] <Cork> garrilla: what you have in that function could just as well be inside the ready, as it doen't define anything
[11:10:32] <Cork> garrilla: http://pastebin.com/sJvMuKkX this though defines a plugin
[11:10:39] <Cork> (see line 2)
[11:12:25] <garrilla> cork, yes.. that's what I had first time round in http://pastebin.com/sJvMuKkX
[11:12:34] <jop008> so you have to do nothing just put your file inthe root?
[11:13:48] <Cork> jop008: yes
[11:13:53] <esmic> cork: i worked it out
[11:14:04] <Cork> browsers query /favicon.ico by default
[11:14:24] <jedimind> you can also specify the location of the favicon, but it defaults to favicon.ico
[11:14:36] <jedimind> also apple-touch-icon cant be an .ico iirc
[11:14:41] <jedimind> it has to be a png
[11:14:49] <Cork> jedimind: ya, but if you specify it you need to have a tag in head
[11:14:58] <jedimind> yip
[11:15:07] <Cork> /favicon.ico works without doing anything but adding the file
[11:17:03] <Cork> http://www.p01.org/releases/DEFENDER_of_the_favicon/ :)
[11:20:52] <Cork> garrilla: this is what i meant you should do http://pastebin.com/yAgYgdqd
[11:23:18] <garrilla> cork, aahh! I get you now...  but it doesn't resolve my problem that highcharts is not a function, although the library is loaded!
[11:23:56] <Cork> garrilla: you run before highchart is loaded
[11:24:11] <Cork> you prob define highchart too late in the document
[11:25:10] <garrilla> cork, let's say I remove "$('#chart').buildHighCharts();" from the ready statement. Then I wait sometime for everything to have concluded loading and I run "$('#chart').buildHighCharts();" from the console, I will still get that error
[11:26:16] <Cork> garrilla: are you loading multiple versions of jquery?
[11:28:41] <garrilla> cork, nope... my <head> looks like this http://pastebin.com/3vJyMWx7
[11:29:30] <Cork> garrilla: then i have no clue why you are getting that problem
[11:29:43] <Cork> you might be loading something through bootstrap, donno
[11:29:48] <garrilla> cork, OK, thanks for trying
[11:29:51] <Cork> np
[11:30:03] <ortund> Cork, the hiding code?
[11:30:09] <ortund> will look again
[11:30:24] <petey_> Does anyone mind looking at this? http://jsbin.com/iNAHujE/1/edit I'm trying to apply a certain class ONLY to a div that has a certain class, 'parent'
[11:30:30] <petey_> only apply to parent and ignore child
[11:30:43] <petey_> but using .find('parent') doesn't do the trick for me, because I think it looks for the child class 'parent'
[11:31:04] <Cork> ortund: the /4 version changed quite a bit of how it works
[11:31:20] <jphase> petey_: that should probably be .find('.parent') instead
[11:31:32] <petey_> I tried that jphase
[11:31:38] <Cork> ortund: the bar is position absolute by default, and it's space it taken by the margin from header
[11:31:53] <Cork> ortund: and then it jumps from absolute > fixed when scroll happens
[11:32:30] <jphase> petey_: perhaps whatever you're calling .find on isn't the parent of the items with the "parent" class then. .find should recursively search child elements based on whatever parent element you call it on
[11:32:42] <ortund> I'll fiddle on my dev copy of the site
[11:32:43] <jop008> I remove my stuf in the header but no favicon in chrome
[11:33:09] <petey_> it searches children but will it search the same element?
[11:33:22] <petey_> do you mind taking a look at my code? http://jsbin.com/iNAHujE/1/edit
[11:33:38] <jphase> petey_: no, it will only search children recursively, not the element you call it on itself
[11:33:42] <petey_> If i have class "item parent", I need to find 'parent'
[11:33:46] <petey_> i see
[11:33:54] <petey_> any suggestions as to how it can search the element
[11:34:38] <jphase> petey_: .parent().find('.parent')  is one way, or you could rewrite it to use something different
[11:35:03] <jphase> or if you just want to use all elements with parent class, just $('.parent') instead of using $(this).find at all
[11:35:18] <petey_> Well I only want one of the blue cubes to expand
[11:35:30] <petey_> running $(this).parent().find(.'parent') causes all the blue cubes to expand
[11:35:53] <jphase> I guess I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish
[11:36:04] <petey_> http://jsbin.com/iNAHujE/1/edit
[11:36:11] <petey_> Take a look
[11:36:15] <petey_> if you click on the blue box, it should expand
[11:36:20] <petey_> clicking on the orange box will not expand
[11:36:29] <Cork> petey_: you could try siblings('.parent')
[11:36:36] <petey_> but that doesn't work because .find(.'parent') searches inside
[11:36:44] <Cork> if you want just siblings to the current element
[11:37:13] <petey_> Yeah but siblings will expand every other element besides the one I want expanded :*(
[11:37:21] <jphase> petey_: if you just want the current one then do something like:   if($(this).hasClass('parent')) $(this).toggleClass('expanded');
[11:37:47] <jop008> Cork favico sure nothing needed? I see nothing on iPad the favicon is also not visible. It was visible in safari but now gone also
[11:39:08] <petey_> genius!
[11:39:17] <petey_> thank you jphase, cork
[11:39:23] <Cork> jop008: yes, i'm sure, but browsers cache if it found that icon or not
[11:41:50] <Cork> jop008: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#How_to_use
[11:41:54] <Cork> last line in the table
[11:42:04] <Cork> opps second last line ;P
[11:42:46] <jphase> Cork: are you @ work right now?
[11:42:51] <Cork> no
[11:42:59] <Cork> it's 19:42 :)
[11:43:04] <jphase> oic
[11:43:27] <jphase> always wondered why you get active late at night or during the day for me
[11:43:45] <jphase> what country are you from?
[11:43:58] <Cork> jop008: well i have a bouncer so i use one nick for multiple computers
[11:44:02] <Cork> sweden
[11:44:02] * jphase is too lazy to tracert you
[11:44:17] <jphase> oh cool, my bandmate is from there originally
[11:44:48] <jphase> which is a very american thing to say... "oooo I know a swede too!"
[11:45:02] <Cork> lol
[11:45:23] <Cork> you put them in mounters too?
[11:45:32] <jphase> hehe
[11:45:36] <Cork> and go "oooh" "WAH" :D
[11:45:46] <jphase> I always tease her by saying "I like your cheese" and she gets so pissed "THATS SWITZERLAND YOU DICK"
[11:46:10] <Cork> heh
[11:46:43] <Cork> there's even a joke show here (at least it was a little while back) switz or sweden
[11:46:56] <Cork> where the group is going around the wold asking question
[11:47:08] <Cork> and sees if ppl can tell if it switz or sweden :D
[11:47:13] <sayd> how would you preserve scope when running inside a promise callback?
[11:47:56] <Cork> sayd: you would have to pass the variables from the original scope though the resolve reference
[11:48:00] <sayd> ie: function() { promise().then(function() { // this is not the outer f }) }
[11:48:15] <Cork> sayd: you can't
[11:48:25] <Cork> this will always be replaced each time you call a function
[11:48:28] <sayd> ok
[11:48:37] <Cork> so if you want it around store it in a separate variable
[11:48:44] <Cork> ex. var self = this;
[11:48:53] <sayd> yeah
[11:49:10] <sayd> i try to avoid that when i can, but i will go for it in this case
[11:49:11] <Cork> this is special in that functions set it when they are called
[11:50:25] <Cork> sayd: you could use bind() though it is quite new so some browsers doens't support it
[11:50:42] <Cork> sayd: or you could use $.proxy though it is quite costly to run
[11:50:47] <sayd> is it?
[11:50:53] <Cork> ya
[11:50:55] <sayd> costly.. crap i use that alot
[11:51:17] <sayd> i end up with alot of fun.call(this)
[11:55:03] <Cork> sayd: http://jsperf.com/bind-vs-jquery-proxy/18
[11:55:17] <Cork> proxy is ~ 6 times slower then scoping
[11:55:25] <Cork> and 12 times slower then native .bind
[11:55:40] <Cork> oh not
[11:55:41] <Cork> sorry
[11:56:06] <Cork> 7 times slower then native bind
[11:56:14] <sayd> hmm not for me
[11:56:31] <sayd> only 1.5% slower than native bind
[11:57:29] <Cork> hmm, ya looks like chrome is faring quite a bit better
[11:57:39] <Cork> damn i don't have opera on this comp...
[11:58:05] <Cork> either way native scoping is still quite a bit faster on chrome
[11:58:20] <Cork> interesting enough, bind is slower then scoping on chrome >_>
[11:59:00] <Cork> wow opera loves bind >_>
[11:59:18] <sayd> what is the .bind(1);
[11:59:31] <sayd> ah.. its the 'this'
[11:59:51] <ortund> Cork, can you tell me wtf Chrome is doing with my classes? http://i.imgur.com/33IaiHC.png
[12:00:19] <Cork> ortund: what do you mean?
[12:00:35] <ortund> it's got most of the stuff crossed out there
[12:00:35] <Cork> oh
[12:00:38] <Cork> lol
[12:00:47] <sayd> you have a closing comment but no opening one/
[12:00:48] <Cork> it shows the rules twice >_>
[12:01:06] <Cork> sayd: the style rules on the right
[12:01:08] <jedimind> ortund you might be including teh css file twice
[12:01:20] <sayd> using sass?
[12:01:33] <jedimind> no its the same file, same line number
[12:01:40] <jedimind> core.css line 91 in both instances
[12:01:51] <jedimind> not like it compiled it into two different places of the same css file
[12:01:54] <sayd> if its not causing any rendering issues i wouldnt worry about it
[12:01:56] <jedimind> just looks like core.css is included twice
[12:02:07] <jedimind> if you're including your css file twice ... worry about it
[12:02:15] <jedimind> dont "not worry about it because its not breaking anything"
[12:02:22] <Cork> ya
[12:02:24] <ortund> jedimind you nailed it :) thanks
[12:02:28] <Cork> lol
[12:02:34] <ortund> I never noticed that, but I've always had problems with it lol
[12:02:38] <Cork> jedimind++
[12:05:47] <ortund> Cork, now I've broken it again lol
[12:05:49] <ortund> http://i.imgur.com/UHf6JQf.png
[12:06:28] <Cork> ortund: it should be position absolute by default
[12:06:40] <Cork> and when it get sticky it should move to fixed
[12:06:46] <Cork> and reset the margin-top to 0
[12:11:09] <ortund> Cork, I think I'm making progress... now, when I scroll past the top of the div, it disappears for some reason... I'm so frustrated that this is actually hilarious now
[12:11:40] <Cork> ortund: check the margin of the element
[12:12:06] <Cork> i suspect your leaving the martin-top; -39px  around when you do fixed
[12:12:33] <Cork> ortund: btw do you understand what the fiddle i gave you do?
[12:12:43] <Cork> else it would be problematic for you to maintain the page later
[12:16:25] <ortund> Cork, looks like it's just adding the extra css to make it stay in view
[12:16:47] <Cork> ortund: then add the needed margin-top: 0;
[12:17:56] <ortund> it's their... Chrome is crossing it off in the dev tools
[12:18:24] <ortund> it's there*
[12:18:33] * ortund feels embarrassed now
[12:20:19] <Cork> sounds like you have rules conflict
[12:20:19] <Cork> might be that your styling it with and id and a class
[12:20:19] <Cork> and id's have higher priority then classes in css
[12:20:19] <Cork> (it is considered more precise)
[12:20:46] <ortund> that's actually it exactly methinks
[12:22:17] <ortund> this is what I get for duplicating the code and not posting it exactly
[12:26:13] <ortund> Cork, check it out (also, there's something I've added in the code that I think you might like -> http://loganyoung.za.net/software/articles/forms-authentication-in-asp-net/
[12:27:00] <Cork> ah, nice and smooth
[12:27:16] <ortund> checked the code?
[12:27:45] <Cork> ya i see, thx, but it really isn't needed ^^
[12:27:52] <Cork> ortund: though you still have this error <a href"/info.php">
[12:27:58] <ortund> bugger
[12:28:48] <ortund> Cork, I credited you in the code because I'm THAT grateful. I've been trying to do this for months, but haven't ever managed to figure out how
[12:28:48] <Cork> actually there is some more html errors in there
[12:29:10] <Cork> so you might want to run it through w3c validator
[12:29:18] <Cork> ortund: grad you got what you wanted :)
[12:29:35] <ortund> :3
[12:32:33] <ortund> I do need to work over the html on this site... It's all coz of buggered up php includes
[12:32:52] <ortund> why it can't work in a way that makes sense like asp.net master pages, I'll never know
[12:34:49] <Cork> ortund: php can work quite well, it depends on the developer
[12:34:58] <Cork> ortund: asp is slow like crap, so...
[12:35:18] <Vorspire> ugh ASP, run for the hills, run for your liiiife
[12:35:24] <ortund> I'd say a good 90% of my skill with server code lies in .net though
[12:35:48] <CodesStuff> Doesn't Intellisense make programming skill redundant, though? :)
[12:35:57] <duch_kazatel> Cork ASP.NET isn't inherently slow.  it can be.
[12:36:06] <Vorspire> Intellisense is the first step, then there's ReSharper
[12:36:12] <Vorspire> that tool is just amazing
[12:36:26] <CodesStuff> Vorspire: Not familar with it. I'll google.
[12:36:37] <duch_kazatel> last place I worked was a .NET shop that had a surprisingly fast setup.
[12:36:41] <Cork> duch_kazatel: well it has a pool mechanism that is inherently slow
[12:36:56] <ortund> Vorspire I don't think Intellisense makes skill redundant... It doesn't really help much when you're not sure what property or method you're looking for
[12:37:14] <ortund> Even then, if you don't know how to use said method, it doesn't always help you figure out how
[12:37:14] <duch_kazatel> Cork you mean the application pool?
[12:37:21] <Cork> duch_kazatel: yes
[12:37:48] <Vorspire> I don't do ASP.NET, but I do work with a C# based Ultima Online game server emulation software, which is really fun :)
[12:37:57] <Vorspire> ortund; that's too true I guess
[12:38:02] <CodesStuff> ortund: I was the one who said it, lol. I was just poking fun. I wish I had Intellisense for my Python stuff. I do in Sublime, but I've been using Notepad++ lately.
[12:38:24] <ortund> ah, didn't see that CodesStuff
[12:39:03] <duch_kazatel> Cork I remember them being slow sometimes on first request for compilation, but if you properly optimize they're just fun.
[12:39:26] <duch_kazatel> s/fun/fine
[12:39:30] <ortund> Vorspire, I have to say... I started with VB - always said C# was over complicated and had too many brackets and semi-colons and stuff... I've been coding in it for several months now and I hate having to work with VB now
[12:41:17] <Vorspire> I tried VB once, had to go to rehab
[12:41:22] <ortund> looool
[12:43:17] <Cork> lol
[12:43:36] <Cork> Vorspire: i wrote a mail program in wsf :)
[12:43:43] <CodesStuff> "They tried to make me go to rehab, but VB to slow, slow slow".
[12:43:47] <Cork> well rather an email bot
[12:49:37] <offlim> is there any way to make the text in a input field say one thing but the value of the be somthing else?
[12:51:01] <offlim> like if the input field is for money. someone could type in 1,000. but the value for submission would be 1000?
[12:55:16] <andywww> hi, when i have two instances of a plugin running on a page, how do i fire a function of them both? I've done $("resize.pluginname",resize); where resize is my function name but that only fires on the last instance of the plugin.
[12:56:02] <andywww> $(window).on('resize.carousel', resize);
[12:56:04] <andywww> even
[13:02:45] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[13:02:53] <Toerkeium> do you know why this doesn't work? $(":input[type=list]").menu();
[13:03:07] <Toerkeium> I tried select also
[13:03:49] <Toerkeium> I'm trying to style a <select> as jquery menu
[13:04:36] <ortund> Cork, I thought I'd try fixing the html on my site... here's the result http://www.loganyoung.za.net ... I want to cry
[13:05:02] <Cork> :D
[13:05:59] <Cork> ortund: and you still have a stray </section> ;P
[13:06:05] <ortund> could be it
[13:06:10] <Cork> na
[13:06:58] <ortund> ah I think I know what it is
[13:08:16] <Cork> you have some script that is going berserk
[13:08:40] <ortund> nope, the home page didn't have the <section> on it
[13:08:57] <ortund> I'm gonna run it through w3c validator
[13:09:24] <Cork> i just love that firefox source view has a built in error flag for simple html errors :I
[13:09:34] <esmic> how do i empty variables when script ends?
[13:09:52] <Cork> esmic: uh, what?
[13:10:07] <Cork> if thy are defined in a scope thy are removed by default
[13:10:13] <Toerkeium> anyone?
[13:10:19] <Cork> if they are globals you need to reset them to undefined
[13:10:27] <esmic> like myFunction = undefined;
[13:10:42] <Cork> Toerkeium: move the attribute selector before the function call
[13:10:55] <Cork> $("[type=list]:input")
[13:10:57] <drakythe> So I'm missing something totally obvious... I'm trying to reveal an element on hover and I can't seem to make it work, http://jsfiddle.net/LSd22/1/
[13:11:31] <drakythe> agh! I paste that and I see my stupid...
[13:11:42] <Cork> :)
[13:11:54] * Cork stops typing a response ;P
[13:12:39] <drakythe> lol, thanks
[13:13:30] <Toerkeium> Cork: tried your suggestion but it's the same, it works if I do  $(":input[type=text]").menu();
[13:13:49] <Toerkeium> but if I try with "select" or "list" doesn't
[13:14:19] <drakythe> hm... am I not allowed to use 'this' with .children()? my firebug console tells me thats not a function...
[13:15:35] <drakythe> Okay yeah, fixed the obvious stupid, now missing obvious stupid number 2. http://jsfiddle.net/LSd22/2/
[13:16:20] <rmah> drakythe: $(this)
[13:16:28] <drakythe> oh for crying out loud...
[13:16:37] <rmah> heh
[13:16:48] <rmah> that tripped me up a few times when I started using jquery too
[13:16:56] <Cork> Toerkeium: wait a min... list; list isn't a valid input type
[13:17:25] <Cork> Toerkeium: so if you set type="list" on an input element the browser will convert that to type="text"
[13:17:28] <Toerkeium> Cork yes sorry, I tried select and many others, just to test
[13:17:28] <drakythe> rmah: thanks. I don't use jQuery a lot, so I miss a lot of syntax things whenever I start it up again :|
[13:17:47] <Toerkeium> Cork but I tried "select" also, it only works with "text"
[13:17:59] <Cork> Toerkeium: try date
[13:18:13] <Cork> it should work in most browsers, at lest those that supports it
[13:18:47] <Toerkeium> I'll try Cork, thanks
[13:19:06] <Cork> Toerkeium: remember it isn't safe to set random values to not prefixed attributes
[13:19:32] <ortund> My email form's not sending... not sure if it's the ajax or the php ... here's the ajax anyway http://pastebin.com/aCL2GRB2
[13:19:38] <Cork> those that do, often end up having to update the page later cause of a new spec
[13:20:14] <Cork> ortund: success shouldn't be in data
[13:20:21] <Cork> that will throw
[13:20:28] <rmah> it's probably the PHP
[13:20:30] <Cork> cause you can't parse a function to a query string
[13:20:51] <rmah> ortund: look in the browser debugger to make sure your js is sending what you think it should be sending
[13:21:26] <Cork> ortund: the success callback should be a sibling to data
[13:26:50] <nafta> Velveeta you around bro? there's something driving me insaine....
[13:26:58] <Velveeta> yepyep
[13:27:13] <Velveeta> er i mean.. no speaky english
[13:27:52] <nafta> I'm doing this ->     .done(function(data) { console.log(data); var answer = $(data).find(".answerEval").text(); alert(answer); }); seems pretty simple right?
[13:28:10] <nafta> the console log shows this-> <div class="answerEval">correct</div>
[13:28:20] <nafta> but the alert...shows blank
[13:28:23] <nafta> -.-
[13:28:52] <Cork> wait you get html from text() ?
[13:29:06] <sayd> do: $(data).html()
[13:29:29] <Velveeta> if your data is the div.answerEval element
[13:29:30] <sayd> since data is the element
[13:29:31] <Cork> ah
[13:29:37] <Velveeta> then yeah, what sayd ….. sayd
[13:29:41] <Cork> nafta: you want filter not find
[13:30:03] <Cork> cause you only have one element in there it will be the element you find from
[13:30:07] <Cork> so nothing will be found
[13:30:22] <Cork> $(data).text() would work too
[13:30:44] <nafta> now I'm not getting the alert
[13:30:45] <nafta> O_o
[13:30:54] <ortund> firefox is telling me I'm missing a } after my property list but I can't find it
[13:31:05] <nafta>  var answer = $(data).html(); alert(answer);
[13:31:22] <ortund> http://pastebin.com/1SRjB7TA
[13:31:23] <Cork> O_o
[13:31:23] <Velveeta> nothing syntactically wrong with that that i can see
[13:31:38] <sayd> the facebook js api docs are so horrendous
[13:31:46] <nafta> Velveeta me neither
[13:31:49] <nafta> and I get no alert
[13:31:51] <nafta> wtf
[13:31:55] <Cork> ortund: you data block is missing the comma before success
[13:32:28] <Cork> nafta: and no error?
[13:33:53] <nafta> Cork this is crazy
[13:33:55] <nafta> no error
[13:33:59] <nafta> and no alert
[13:34:16] <nafta> can I alert after the done callback?
[13:34:24] <Cork> i suspect answer becomes null
[13:34:31] <Cork> test with a console.log
[13:34:32] <offlim> if i have a div and the padding-left is 5px how would i use jquery to add another 10px when a button is clicked?
[13:34:43] <nafta> Cork   <div class="answerEval">incorrect</div>
[13:34:47] <nafta> that's what console logs shows me
[13:34:57] <Cork> nafta: for answer?
[13:35:05] <Cork> or data?
[13:35:14] <nafta> answer
[13:35:22] <Cork> O_o
[13:35:28] <Cork> that makes no sense
[13:35:38] <CodesStuff> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkodTydUR0E
[13:35:51] <nafta>   <div class="answerEval">incorrect</div>
[13:36:05] <nafta> Cork I'm getting a space...that space you see there
[13:36:10] <ortund> firefox isn't loading out of cache :(
[13:36:12] <nafta> that space could be an issue?
[13:36:12] <Velveeta> offlim: $(yourDiv).css('padding-left', '+=10px')
[13:36:27] <Cork> Velveeta: does that work for css too?
[13:36:28] <Velveeta> or you could just specify '15px'
[13:36:36] <Velveeta> cork: i believe it does
[13:36:37] <Cork> though it was only for animate
[13:36:48] <Velveeta> i'm not positive, but i think it works
[13:36:52] <Cork> now i'm interested!
[13:36:55] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:37:53] <Cork> that is cool...
[13:38:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/E9BDY/
[13:38:09] <Cork> Velveeta: thx, didn't know that
[13:38:11] <nafta> Cork
[13:38:15] <Scroll_Tro0L> I'm having some trouble passing stuff from php -> ajax
[13:38:15] <nafta> it was the position..
[13:38:18] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[13:38:25] <nafta> if I add the alert BEFORE the log...I now see the alert
[13:38:39] <Scroll_Tro0L> How do I need to present the info in Php for Ajax to pick it up?
[13:38:52] <Velveeta> nafta: where you place it shouldn't matter if there's no error being thrown, can you post a fiddle or something?
[13:38:56] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: just echo it to the response stream
[13:39:14] <Velveeta> just make sure you abide by the expected format from your ajax function
[13:39:15] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, I'm super noob, example would be very much appreciated!
[13:39:28] <Velveeta> if you specify dataType: 'json', output json_encode(yourData); etc
[13:39:33] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: <?php echo data; ?>
[13:39:47] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: if you want html or text response
[13:39:55] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: <?php echo json_encode(data); ?>
[13:39:59] <nhulea> Cork I am still having trouble gettiung that previous value let me show you my code
[13:40:02] <Cork> or rather
[13:40:06] <Scroll_Tro0L> Corey, I want to tell a plugin either success or error
[13:40:08] <offlim> velveeta: thank you
[13:40:22] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: <?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); echo json_encode(data); ?>
[13:40:25] <Velveeta> offlim: no problem :)
[13:40:27] <Cork> if you want to send json
[13:40:42] <ortund> Cork, this is driving me mad... I added the ; that I missed and the error persists... http://pastebin.com/1SRjB7TA
[13:40:46] <CodesStuff> that wont work :|
[13:40:52] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, I have a JSON example here on the plugin page, I'll use it then: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#json
[13:40:54] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: if you want to trigger the error handler you need to send a http status code
[13:40:55] <Velveeta> not a semicolon, a comma
[13:40:55] <CodesStuff> data doesn't have $ :D
[13:41:00] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: 4xx or 5xx
[13:41:01] <Velveeta> ortund
[13:41:19] <Cork> ortund: line 9
[13:41:32] <Cork> and you are still missing the needed comma
[13:41:33] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, Maybe I'm wording it wrong, it's not meant to be an error page, but an error in a form submission
[13:41:38] <ortund> sorry... old paste, I've added the ; there
[13:41:55] <Velveeta> ortund: not a semicolon, a comma
[13:42:00] <ortund> fark
[13:42:00] <Cork> ortund: comma as in "," not ";"
[13:42:03] <nafta> wtf
[13:42:08] <nafta> I can't save a fiddle
[13:42:24] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: you can't really trigger error in a form
[13:42:46] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: you can send json response and have the script handle that
[13:42:54] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: or you can send a new form with the errors in it
[13:43:11] <nafta> Cork Velveeta here is my fiddle
[13:43:12] <nafta> http://jsfiddle.net/x5mkR/
[13:43:13] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, I just wan't to display an error message up top.
[13:43:16] <ortund> why won't firefox reload the page out of cache? >:(
[13:43:16] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: or you can send a http 4xx status and the script can take that as a validation error
[13:43:23] <Velveeta> yeah i think he's talking about getting back a response object similar to something like this: { success: false, error: 'Please enter your first name' };
[13:43:25] <Scroll_Tro0L> Corey, So just some div business w/ JS
[13:43:38] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: then just send the message back and have the success handler add it to the page
[13:43:40] <Scroll_Tro0L> Sry, i keep tabbing to 'corey"
[13:44:14] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, K, and sorry I'm slow, but I will send the message via echo?
[13:44:21] <Cork> yes
[13:44:24] <Velveeta> nafta: and that doesn't alert anything?
[13:44:25] <nafta> WTF I'm getting no alert
[13:44:30] <nafta> no nadda
[13:44:33] <Cork> $('#error').text(message); for ex.
[13:44:34] <nafta> not even blank alert
[13:44:43] <Velveeta> and no errors?
[13:44:47] <nafta> no
[13:44:48] <nafta> nadda
[13:44:53] <nafta> wtf is this withcraft
[13:45:03] <Velveeta> how about on like 11 there you do console.log($(data).text());
[13:45:09] <nhulea> Cork: I am trying get oldVal and newVal to be what they say they are ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/fQ52G/
[13:45:19] <nhulea> Cork: Right now they are the same for some resason
[13:46:05] <nafta> Velveeta incorrect
[13:46:09] <nafta> that's what I'm getting
[13:46:10] <Cork> nhulea: you replace the old value before you grab it
[13:46:19] <Cork> nhulea: so it will always be the new value
[13:46:26] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, So would I get the php response via success: and then make a function that reads if it's good or bad?
[13:46:33] <nafta> if I choose the correct one Velveeta...I get correct
[13:46:37] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: yes
[13:46:38] <nafta> I mean.."correct"
[13:46:39] <Velveeta> nafta: then put a line after the var answer assignment and console.log(answer);
[13:46:49] <nafta> without the qutations
[13:46:56] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, Got it, so whatever the response is, it'll be read thru "success:".
[13:47:08] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: normally yes
[13:47:22] <nafta> Velveeta what do you mean put a line?
[13:47:24] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, Makes sense, thanks a bunch!
[13:47:26] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: error is only triggered if the server response code is 4xx or 5xx
[13:47:31] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: np
[13:47:33] <nafta> oh}
[13:47:35] <nafta> hold on
[13:47:48] <Velveeta> nafta: i mean type console.log(answer); on the line after the var answer assignment
[13:47:48] <nhulea> like .append ?
[13:48:28] <nafta> Velveeta nadda
[13:48:31] <nafta> I get zero
[13:48:43] <nafta> is that a reserved word or what?
[13:48:49] <nafta> should I change the name of the var
[13:48:50] <nafta> ?
[13:48:50] <Velveeta> shouldn't be
[13:48:58] <Velveeta> drop a breakpoint there and see what happens when you step over it
[13:50:33] <nafta> Velveeta no idea on how to do that...so basically what's going on is that I can't equal a var to the data that's coming...are you kidding me?
[13:51:22] <Velveeta> if you don't know how to set a breakpoint, then put the (minus quotes) "debugger;" on the line before your var answer assignment
[13:53:35] <nafta> Velveeta I added debugger;
[13:53:42] <nafta> where should I look for that data?
[13:53:51] <Velveeta> what browser are you in?
[13:53:55] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, I've got "success: alert(data)" on ajax and "echo 'weee';" on PHp, no luck.
[13:53:56] <nafta> I mean..for the debug return
[13:53:59] <nafta> chrome
[13:54:03] <nafta> I have the console open
[13:54:21] <Velveeta> there should be (on the sources tab) a play button w/ a few buttons next to it
[13:54:26] <Velveeta> for step into/over/out
[13:54:37] <Velveeta> you want to step over that line, and step over the var answer line
[13:54:41] <Velveeta> and see what happens
[13:55:24] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: success: function(data) { alert(data); }
[13:56:52] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, Tried that earlier, gave me JS errors
[13:57:18] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, http://puu.sh/546cE.png
[13:57:21] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: could you paste your js code in jsfiddle.net ?
[13:58:15] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/QsTmr/
[13:58:49] <Velveeta> that's no bueno
[13:59:22] <sayd> im digging liveweave a little more than jsfiddle
[13:59:47] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: ah, you use ajaxForm
[13:59:51] <nafta> Velveeta this is crazy
[13:59:59] <nafta> I am getting all that line commented out on the sources
[14:00:02] <nafta> it looks green
[14:00:02] <nafta> wtfg
[14:00:14] <nhulea> Cork: yeah how would I replace the value cause I am not seeing it $('#number_students_set_1').data('oldVal',$('#number_students_set_1').val()); I have this
[14:00:24] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: try http://jsfiddle.net/QsTmr/1/
[14:00:30] <Velveeta> scroll_tro0l: you should be passing your success option without the function wrapper
[14:00:33] <nhulea> the this     var oldVal=$('#number_students_set_1').data("oldVal");
[14:00:51] <Cork> nhulea: set the oldValue the last you do in the change event
[14:00:54] <nafta> Velveeta ok this is what I'm getting it
[14:01:12] <nafta> Local answer: undefined data: "  <div class="answerEval">correct</div>"
[14:01:13] <Cork> nhulea: also you might want to trigger a change event on the element on page load
[14:01:24] <Cork> nhulea: so you populate the oldValue on the element
[14:01:34] <Cork> nhulea: or loop the input fields and grab it that way
[14:01:38] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, We have a winner! http://puu.sh/546tP.png
[14:01:44] <Scroll_Tro0L> Cork, As ususal, thanks a ton!
[14:02:09] <Scroll_Tro0L> Oh that pic sucks actually, it didnt capture the alert
[14:02:13] <Cork> Scroll_Tro0L: np
[14:02:15] <Scroll_Tro0L> but it's there XD
[14:02:18] <Velveeta> nafta: is this up somewhere we can see it, or can you make a functional jsfiddle out of it?
[14:03:59] <Velveeta> about to go into a meeting for half an hour or so, so i'll be unresponsive for a bit
[14:04:15] <Cork> nhulea: http://jsfiddle.net/SSSJe/1/
[14:04:46] <Cork> ah
[14:05:03] <Cork> nafta: try $($.parseHTML(data)).text()
[14:05:43] <Cork> nafta: newer versions of jquery is quite picky with what html it accepts directly in $()
[14:05:50] <hugo_moss> i do an ajax request and get back the data as html, when i try to create the jquery object from this html it throws an error, do i have to take out the doctype and all that information?
[14:05:58] <Cork> and leading spaces is one of the things it doesn't accept
[14:06:20] <ortund> right, so now that (with Cork's help) I've figured out why firefox wasn't loading the right version, I've checked and my ajax executes fine
[14:06:36] <ortund> not sure at all whether or not it posts to the php though
[14:06:49] <Cork> hugo_moss: $($.parseHTML()) should work
[14:07:40] <gumble> what can I do to find out why my code inside of jQuery(document).ready(function(){}); isn't fired??
[14:07:46] <gumble> no errors, and in all other files it works
[14:07:52] <Cork> hugo_moss: $($.parseHTML(fullHTMLPage)).find('selector') should get you a workable section
[14:07:55] <gumble> just in one somehow jquery thinks naaa why should I
[14:08:19] <Cork> gumble: and no errors?
[14:08:48] <gumble> no, only one in another file. does that crash all query?
[14:08:59] <nhulea> wow thats weird I feel like that is what I had thanks Cork
[14:09:06] <Cork> gumble: it stops js execution
[14:09:11] <Cork> so yes that would explain it
[14:09:52] <Cork> nhulea: even the loop at the bottom of that one?
[14:10:05] <Cork> nhulea: else you won't have the initial page value
[14:10:13] <gumble> oh ok thanks!
[14:10:16] <Cork> nhulea: alternatively you can set data-value="" on the element
[14:10:21] <Cork> and skip that part
[14:10:27] <Cork> (it would be the cleaner solution)
[14:11:40] <nafta> Velveeta solved it
[14:11:50] <nafta> for some reason I was getting everything commented out
[14:11:56] <sayd> promises really are over my head
[14:11:59] <nafta> err commented
[14:12:13] <nafta> Velveeta I had this -> // $(".modal").fadeOut("fast"); in top of all that
[14:12:20] <nafta> and it was fucking everything up
[14:12:27] <jphase> never break your promises ;)
[14:12:39] <sayd> anyone know how i could do something like this http://liveweave.com/wznQz2
[14:15:13] <kittonian> css3pie was recommended to me earlier to solve a rounded corner problem in IE6+ but I am still having some issues with it displaying properly. can anyone give me a hand?
[14:17:24] <Cork> ah, the horrible old days with htc hacks for ie...
[14:17:48] <Cork> kittonian: those htc hacks normally have quite a long list of limitations
[14:18:18] <Cork> haven't heard of css3pie before, but i suspect is uses vml
[14:21:00] <frothnicator> When I bind an function to an event (e.g., $something.bind( 'change', func )) does it add to a list of functions, or does it overwrite any existing functions?
[14:21:44] <jphase> frothnicator: it adds on to a queue of change events, but you should use .on('change', func        instead ;)
[14:22:11] <frothnicator> jphase: alright.  I /think/ I can do that with CanJS ...
[14:22:19] <jphase> wow, haven't used pie in a long time, since I had to round corners in IE6 *shiver*
[14:22:33] <Cork> jphase: actually if is fine using either of those
[14:22:42] <frothnicator> jphase: can you explain the on vs bind thing?
[14:22:46] <frothnicator> what's the difference?
[14:22:58] <jphase> preference
[14:22:58] <Cork> frothnicator: it is the same exact thing
[14:23:10] <Cork> frothnicator: on is a new combination function
[14:23:21] <Cork> it is bind and delegate combined into one function
[14:23:28] <frothnicator> Cork: thanks.
[14:23:35] <Cork> and the old bind and delegate function is just a wrapper around on now days
[14:23:41] * frothnicator goes to look up delegate
[14:23:45] <Cork> so there is no difference at all calling bind or on
[14:24:05] <kittonian> Cork: agreed. i've never used one before today and really need to get properly rounded corners working cross platform. couldn't get it to work using the jquery corners plugin
[14:24:06] <Cork> frothnicator: on has two syntaxes
[14:24:14] <kittonian> Cork: I'm certainly open to suggestions
[14:24:39] <jphase> kittonian: if you need to support ie6 rounded corners, css3pie is the way to go imo
[14:24:46] <sayd> Kinda got htis promise thing working http://liveweave.com/akCy0t
[14:24:53] <Cork> kittonian: honestly... use png files for ie, or just leave it with square corners
[14:25:09] <jphase> png files with transparencies don't work in IE
[14:25:11] <Cork> the rounding isn't worth the trouble
[14:25:20] <Cork> jphase: it does
[14:25:20] <kittonian> jphase: that's what I'm doing and I'm testing it in IE7 but am still getting the square background corners while seeing the properly rounded corners on the border
[14:25:22] <sayd> seems to leave an oauth window dangling tho
[14:25:28] <jphase> well, you have to use a png fix for it
[14:25:31] <Cork> you just have to load it with the special filter thing
[14:25:32] <frothnicator> Cork:  thanks
[14:25:43] <nafta> how can I refresh a div that got php inside it...with jquery? I mean..how can I deal with it?
[14:25:59] <jphase> css3pie is also kinda clunky too
[14:26:17] <Cork> nafta: you would have to send a request to the server (ajax) and fetch a new execution
[14:26:25] <jphase> but honestly... since Microsoft doesn't support ie6, neither should you imo
[14:26:29] <frothnicator> nafta: PHP is a server side thing, so you'll need to refactor to either reload the div from the server, or organize the PHP writing differently.
[14:26:36] <kittonian> i'm not really. ie7 and above only
[14:26:51] <jphase> oh okay, well that's *better* I suppose
[14:27:40] <Cork> kittonian: this is what i used once upone a time http://www.htmlremix.com/css/curved-corner-border-radius-cross-browser?ModPagespeed=noscript
[14:28:43] <Cork> man... that was quite a few years ago... >_>
[14:29:06] <nafta> Cork would you mind to take a look at a pastebin to see what I'm trying to do?
[14:29:33] <Cork> look for what?
[14:29:55] <nafta> for the idea of what I'm trying to update
[14:30:20] <Cork> oh right, well if you want to run php you HAVE to make an ajax all
[14:30:25] <Cork> there is no way around that
[14:30:39] <Cork> well except for a full page reload though
[14:32:06] <esmic> im trying to get a my script to recalculate but it wont. could anyone take a look http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/9yQRq/2/
[14:32:06] <nafta> Cork http://pastebin.com/3LgU43XU
[14:32:59] <nafta> Cork inside those if conditions...I'm going to echo a var with all the html content depending on the result...and then update the <div class="wrapper"></div>
[14:33:00] <nafta> right?
[14:35:45] <kittonian> Cork: that's pretty amazing. it actually does the rounded corners properly, but it ignores the background altogether and just makes it black. i need to retain the background color and transparency
[14:36:02] <Cork> nafta: you need to have a separate file that runs only that part and sends it as a response to an ajax call
[14:36:49] <Cork> kittonian: ya, it actually puts a vml element behind the element (ie version of svg)
[14:37:19] <Cork> it can handle color but isn't good with images
[14:38:27] <Velveeta> hey guys.. has anybody heard of javascript? i need some help with my site, healthcare.gov
[14:38:51] <Cork> anyway i'm off to bed
[14:38:54] <kittonian> Cork: not doing any images, just a background color with transparency
[14:38:54] <Cork> o/
[14:39:10] <Cork> kittonian: transparency or opacity?
[14:39:15] <kittonian> opacity
[14:39:33] <Cork> kittonian: opacity will be really hard to handle
[14:39:41] <Cork> older ie's are really bad at it
[14:40:31] <Velveeta> yeah i think you have to use an -ms-filter: alpha(); or something
[14:40:43] <kittonian> heh, that parts already working fine
[14:40:43] <nafta> Cork and can I make a function to call it onclick? I mean..after hitting the Answer button?
[14:40:50] <kittonian> just need the rounded corners and i'm good
[14:41:22] <Cork> nafta: the click calls the ajax, the server sends the new content, and the success callback adds/replaces it on the page
[14:41:26] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[14:41:52] * jphase waves
[14:42:32] <nafta> thanks a lot
[14:42:43] <kittonian> night Cork

[14:51:52] <shwaiil> thanks for looking!
[14:52:36] <shwaiil> guess the answer is getjson

[14:58:03] <tables> how do i get all instances that are test6 and output it as HTML?

[15:33:49] <ChrisAntaki> hey Glaksmono
[15:51:29] <nafta> Velveeta you around? :D
[15:51:30] <nafta> haha
[15:51:34] <Velveeta> yep
[15:51:45] <nafta> ok I've made some amazing stuff
[15:51:46] <nafta> :P
[15:52:23] <nafta> the only way I have to load something...is...with timeinterval?
[15:52:25] <nafta> like to update it
[15:52:40] <Velveeta> setInterval?
[15:52:44] <nafta> when the page loads, with time intervals...or when the user triggers something..right?
[15:53:14] <Velveeta> if i'm following your question properly, then yes… either some user-driven event or else some timed event
[15:53:22] <nafta> ok
[15:53:41] <nafta> ok let me check on something thanks again
[15:53:48] <Velveeta> no problem
[15:54:19] <ortund> time for bed... Cork, thanks a million for all the help today :) tomorrow I continue to fix the cock ups I made trying to fix the html lol
[15:57:22] <heshanh> when i do clone() and attaching a click event to the newly cloned element,  is there a special way to use on? im doing this at  the moment $('.remove_duplicate_rate_line').on('click', function()
[15:57:24] <Eviltwin> If anyone wants to know how to not write jQuery, check this out: https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace/global/en_US/registration.js
[15:59:49] <jphase> whoa, that's wretched
[16:01:12] <Velveeta> hilarious
[16:01:12] <Eviltwin> Inefficient and riddled bugs
[16:01:41] <Velveeta> my guess is they were shooting for internationalization and hoping the browser cache would help decrease load time after the first page hit
[16:01:46] <Velveeta> but that's pretty disgusting
[16:02:07] <Velveeta> looks like a bunch of backbone code at the bottom too
[16:06:43] <Eviltwin> resources['ffe.ee.myAccount.testthing'] = '<span  style="color: red">Reduce The Number of keys<a href="#" onclick="alert(&#39;hey&#39;);">This is a Links</a></span>';
[16:06:46] <Eviltwin> ...
[16:07:22] <dwarder> with for(var index in array){ } last item is not executed?
[16:07:53] <Eviltwin> If it's an array, use for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { ... }
[16:08:07] <dwarder> Eviltwin: so it is?
[16:09:03] <dwarder> yeah jsfiddle doesn't work for  me too
[16:09:23] <dwarder> ohh now it works
[16:10:52] <Eviltwin> Problems frequently aren't where you think they are
[16:10:57] <Eviltwin> We build up assumptions
[16:11:05] <Eviltwin> when working with large codebases
[16:11:07] <dwarder> why this doesn't work?
[16:11:12] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/HeYEv/
[16:11:43] <Eviltwin> Because you have invalid JavaScript in the JavaScript box
[16:11:55] <Eviltwin> Are you familiar with how to use the Chrome debug tools / Firebug?
[16:11:57] <dwarder> Eviltwin: what so invalid in it?
[16:12:08] <dwarder> Eviltwin: you are not helping at all
[16:12:11] <Eviltwin> You have a typo
[16:12:17] <dwarder> ok sorry
[16:12:17] <Eviltwin> At the end of one of the lines
[16:12:21] <Eviltwin> There are 4 so it should be easy to find
[16:12:52] <Eviltwin> Your console should have "SyntaxError" in red in it
[16:13:01] <rmah> I have a canvas and when I call drawImage on its context, only a portion of the image draws and it's zoomed in
[16:13:10] <rmah> anyone ever seen anything like that before?
[16:13:10] <dwarder> i don't understand what illegal token means
[16:13:17] <rmah> dwarder: character
[16:13:26] <rmah> like a , where there shouldn't be
[16:13:31] <rmah> a token is parser talk
[16:13:40] <dwarder> i don't see it, i look at JS code for 10 hours already
[16:13:42] <rmah> so... about my problem
[16:14:15] <dwarder> where is the typo
[16:14:16] <Eviltwin> rmah: Your problem is not a jQuery problem
[16:14:16] <dwarder> ?
[16:14:19] <ChrisAntaki> >> so... about my problem - always a good way to start a conversation
[16:14:20] <rmah> dwarder: you have a backtick at the end of the console.log line
[16:14:40] <dwarder> rmah: ROFL i though this is my monitor dirty
[16:14:41] <Eviltwin> rmah: How are you defining the <canvas> size?
[16:14:43] <dwarder> :)
[16:14:44] <rmah> Eviltwin: I know but I don't know where else to ask :-(
[16:14:48] <dwarder> well it is
[16:15:05] <rmah> doing this... var canvas = $("#imgCanvas").css({width: w+'px', height: h+'px'})[0];
[16:15:16] <rmah> I check canvas in the debugger and it's the raw canvas
[16:15:21] <rmah> and the size is correct
[16:20:06] <rmah> man, when I try to do this on jsfiddle, I get cross border scripting errors :-(
[16:22:21] <rmah> ah, figured it out!
[16:22:44] <rmah> you can't set the size of the canvas via css, you have to do it directly with canvas.width and canvas.height
[16:22:49] <CodesStuff> Correct
[16:22:51] <rmah> fucking god damn pisser shit for nothing
[16:23:01] <CodesStuff> When you resize, it also clears the canvas as well.
[16:23:16] <rmah> k thanks :-)
[16:24:08] <CodesStuff> rmah: I really want to know what you're working on now. I'm assuming some sort of designer, since you were doing that drag and drop stuff and now messing with canvas.
[16:24:42] <CodesStuff> Image upload -> drawing on canvas with coordinates from .draggable -> exporting dataUri -> ImageMagick/GDI?
[16:25:00] <rmah> CodesStuff: oh sorry, nothing secret.  a prototyping tool for custom printing on products
[16:25:09] <rmah> combine images, add text, that sort of shit
[16:25:18] <rmah> outputs a set of proofs for "printing" on various products
[16:25:36] <rmah> it's for internal/client use
[16:25:46] <rmah> erm, client's clients
[16:25:48] <CodesStuff> Ah. That was anticlimactic.
[16:25:50] <rmah> heh
[16:26:29] <rmah> it's got layers!  and custom fonts!  everything is re-sizable and rotatable!  image resizing with seam carving!  image processing!
[16:26:49] <rmah> auto resize to fit minor product variations
[16:27:03] <rmah> auto-color correct for different printing processes
[16:27:05] <rmah> etc, etc, etc
[16:27:50] <rmah> currently client uses a bunch of graphic "artists" to do mock ups for clients.  this will replace some of them and let clients do it themselves.  at least that's the plan.
[16:28:12] <rmah> personally, I think most clients will still want the graphic artists to do it for them.  but that's not my problem :-)
[16:28:46] <rmah> CodesStuff: bet you think you know too much now :-)
[16:29:02] <CodesStuff> I don't think you were paying attention when I mentioned this idea awhile ago, but it was an alright one. Tablet app to take pics of a small business' store. Inventory, food, etc.
[16:29:17] <rmah> I vaguely recall
[16:29:24] <CodesStuff> Then generate a site based on a previous template right then and there in the store/shop, and show it to the potential client.
[16:29:56] <CodesStuff> I wouldn't do any of the lead acquisition, but the software itself would make a killing by licensing it out to those wordpress warrior web firms
[16:30:05] <rmah> CodesStuff: that makes it seem too easy to build a site
[16:30:18] <rmah> can't charge $200k if you do that :-)
[16:30:33] <CodesStuff> I agree, but the guys doing the demo would explain that it's merely a mockup/POC.
[16:30:41] <CodesStuff> They're in sales; they can pitch it however they want.
[16:31:45] <CodesStuff> Plus the target demographic would be small business owners/restaurants, not large companies. Little guys don't have $200k to throw at web presence lol.
[16:37:30] <dwarder> is this a corrent selector? .find('li:not(.class)');
[16:37:39] <dwarder> correct*
[16:38:17] <CodesStuff> looks ir
[16:38:18] <CodesStuff> it
[16:38:56] <dwarder> it is
[16:39:00] <dwarder> CodesStuff: thank you
[16:45:28] <nafta> I have a question which I'll try to explain as clear as possible. I have a div with class "button" and data-filter=".trivia" whe a user press this button...they get a modal. Thing is I need that button only to appear when there's a trivia to be answered if the trivia has been already answered then...just show the latest trivia and no button. I am updating thru an ajax call the content of <div
[16:45:29] <nafta> class="wrapper"></div> within this div the button exists...once I set a timeInterval to update this div...the button stops working...if I remove the timeinterval...the button works.. any clues?
[16:47:27] <rmah> nafta: update the div in response to the success event from the ajax call
[16:47:31] <rmah> you have a timing issue
[16:47:59] <rmah> instead of waiting via timeInterval, respond to events
[16:48:32] <ilovecode121212> you need to check inside ajax is the trivia condition met, and if it is return button
[16:50:30] <nafta> the button returns..
[16:50:34] <nafta> everything prints correctly
[16:50:41] <nafta> problem is...the button is not working anymore
[16:50:58] <nafta> I have set 3min of timeInterval
[16:51:02] <nafta> I mean..that's enough
[16:51:37] <ilovecode121212> if the button returns with ajax you need to reatach event listener to it again
[16:51:57] <nafta> rmah problem is...the user answers a trivia...and exactly 50/60 minutes later he should get another one...so no other event other than time happens
[16:52:18] <nafta> ilovecode121212 the button just calls a modal
[16:52:26] <nafta> <div class="button" data-filter=".trivia">Responder</div>
[16:52:29] <nafta> that's my button
[16:52:41] <rmah> who leaves a web page open for 60 minutes?
[16:52:55] <ilovecode121212> good point..
[16:53:36] <ilovecode121212> but the moddal stops working once you return the button with ajax?
[16:54:15] <nafta> ilovecode121212 yes
[16:54:30] <nafta> I have a script..that echo's the html
[16:54:42] <nafta> rmah if you are watching a game baseball game
[16:54:52] <ilovecode121212> ok inside ajax put again <script>on click function call modal </script> and return that with the button again
[16:54:52] <nafta> and using it as a second screen
[16:55:15] <rmah> nafta: I think you should put the "time for next question" into a cookie
[16:55:22] <rmah> and then check that cookie every once in a while
[16:55:32] <rmah> that way, the user can close the page and come back and still get his trivia
[16:56:20] <nafta> rmah ilovecode121212 -> http://jsfiddle.net/x5mkR/1/
[16:56:25] <nafta> that's what my button does
[16:56:33] <nafta> and I have it in a index.js
[16:56:52] <nafta> do I have to print all that again? O_o
[17:00:51] <ilovecode121212> sec
[17:02:20] <ilovecode121212> try to replace first line with this :
[17:02:21] <ilovecode121212> $("body").on("click", ".m-main .menu-item, .t-main .button" , function() {
[17:02:28] <ilovecode121212> if it does not work, print it again
[17:02:42] <ilovecode121212> its badly designed anyway
[17:15:40] <nafta> anyone have a good tutorial around to register thru twitter?
[17:16:23] <nafta> ilovecode121212 crap..that worked
[17:16:26] <nafta> thanks a lot
[17:16:52] <nafta> ilovecode121212 you up for some quick bucks=
[17:16:53] <nafta> ?
[17:17:36] <ilovecode121212> what you need doode?
[17:17:52] <tables> var input =  iframe1.contentWindow.CKEDITOR.instances.test6.getData();
[17:17:54] <tables>             outputBody.innerHTML = '<div>' + input + '</div>';
[17:17:54] <tables> how do i get all instances that are test6 and output it as HTML?
[17:18:39] <ilovecode121212> np nafta
[17:20:15] <nafta> ilovecode121212 I need to make a register with twitter to block my index.html
[17:21:40] <ilovecode121212> i am not an expert in social networks, i dont use them got email only, however i belive there is developer documentation for twitter where you should be able to find your answer
[17:27:22] <ilovecode121212> tables you need to do foreach test6 instance, get data and then output them somehow, not sure what exacly are you trying to do
[17:27:41] <tables> i need syntax, i'm new to javascript and jquery
[17:28:40] <ilovecode121212> well the syntax in this case is contextual to what you are trying to do, and to the plugin i belive CKEDITOR
[17:30:26] <ilovecode121212> you are trying to get content from multiple textareas?
[17:30:33] <ilovecode121212> and output it?
[17:31:27] <coldhead> ah IRC, I remember you
[17:31:27] <b-ot> coldhead: You have 5 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[17:32:13] <coldhead> davey!
[17:51:25] <Ericx2x> Hey guys I have something like this written in jQUery:
[17:51:26] <Ericx2x> 'left': '845px',
[17:51:36] <Ericx2x> is it possible I can do something like this instead?
[17:51:46] <Ericx2x> 'left': 'float-left',
[17:51:55] <Ericx2x> or float-right rather
[17:58:17] <ilovecode121212> try  'float':'left'
[18:06:39] <frothnicator> If I use a <colgroup> in my table, is there a jQuery function to discover the column/colgroup in which a tbody cell  resides?
[18:14:03] <ilovecode121212> yes find
[18:14:45] <ilovecode121212> in combination with parent
[18:30:05] <quackgyver> Hi. I'm trying to code a context menu-esque popup element for logging in on my website, but I can't seem to find a good approach to this via google. What I'd like to do is make it so that both hovering and clicking on the login link will toggle the visibility of the popup, but in the case of hovering, I'd like for it to only disappear if the mouse cursor is not hovering over neither the link
[18:30:05] <quackgyver> nor menu, and probably with a few seconds of grace time as well.
[18:30:11] <quackgyver> I'm finding this to be incredibly complex to be honest.
[18:30:18] <quackgyver> And yet it seems like such a simple feature.
[18:30:26] <quackgyver> Any ideas that don't involve using some third party library?
[18:31:49] <LaMakina> do you have a prototype working somewhere ?
[18:31:55] <LaMakina> or a jsfiddle of your attempt
[18:32:13] <quackgyver> No, I don't even know where to begin.
[18:32:31] <quackgyver> All I have is an anchor link and a detached, hidden login form.
[18:32:45] <quackgyver> And I've spent about an hour trying to find an example of what I'm trying to do via google.
[18:33:09] <LaMakina> question: if you click but leave the link, will that hide the popup as well ?
[18:33:42] <quackgyver> Yeah, but that would be unnecessary since I want the popup to hide after a second or two of not hovering over the link nor popup.
[18:34:06] <LaMakina> do you know the basics of jquery ?  .hide() .show()  .dialog() etc..
[18:35:06] <quackgyver> LaMakina: Yeah I do.
[18:35:32] <quackgyver> But I don't know how to do anything beyond direct reactions to events.
[18:35:37] <LaMakina> why dont you start a prototype in jsfiddle.
[18:35:45] <quackgyver> Ok.
[18:38:09] <quackgyver> http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/
[18:39:49] <LaMakina> ok
[18:40:20] <quackgyver> I feel like I want to have a combination if "if not hover" and "on click" and "on hover"
[18:40:23] <quackgyver> with delays
[18:40:28] <quackgyver> but I don't really know how to approach it
[18:40:35] <quackgyver> combination of*
[18:40:46] <esmic> lamakina can you take a look at myprojectafter
[18:45:01] <foucist> any idea how i can actually check that the input with data-disable-with is actually working (i.e. getting disabled after click) ?
[18:45:08] <foucist> it's not an ajax scenario, just a regular post
[18:45:28] <foucist> can i test this in chrome console for example?
[18:46:17] <LaMakina> @quackgyver http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/
[18:46:34] <LaMakina> that's a possible solution.
[18:48:07] <quackgyver> LaMakina: I think you just pasted me back my original link
[18:48:08] <quackgyver> :)
[18:48:40] <LaMakina> oops :p
[18:48:40] <LaMakina> http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/1/
[18:52:05] <quackgyver> LaMakina: Unfortunately that's not a solution because it requires me to place the form inside the div which the event listens to
[18:52:31] <quackgyver> which means that if the link is not the same width as the container, the user will be able to hover over the empty space next to it as if it were the link
[18:52:36] <quackgyver> I already considered this. :/
[18:52:42] <quackgyver> Also, it lacks the delay I need
[18:53:02] <quackgyver> I consider the grace delay very important as users are highly likely to place the mouse cursor outside the login form when dealing with it
[18:53:04] <LaMakina> the problem arises when you hover off your 1st link
[18:53:19] <LaMakina> the grace delay is another thing
[18:53:29] <quackgyver> Yes, they are two separate issues, I agree. :)
[18:56:18] <esmic> i need help with some calc, just cant figure it out
[18:57:14] <shoky> esmic: yes?
[18:59:12] <Forbidd3n> How to make a jquery function run on page load?
[18:59:45] <Forbidd3n> I want to run an ajax page to run when the page loads
[19:00:05] <shoky> Forbidd3n: $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[19:02:48] <Forbidd3n> and I can use put the jQuery.ajax in there?
[19:03:01] <Forbidd3n> or put it in a function and call the function in document).ready
[19:03:19] <shoky> both are fine
[19:04:10] <quackgyver> Anyone know how I can create a popup menu with jQuery that appears when hovering over a link, but doesn't disappear until the user has clicked outside the popup element? Here is a starter template in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/
[19:04:23] <quackgyver> I really don't know what to do.
[19:05:49] <shoky> quackgyver: you can wrap both elements in a containing element and do the hover/mouseenter  on it
[19:06:32] <quackgyver> shoky: I can't, because the link is not as wide as the container element, so there would be a large chunk of invisible space next to the link that would trigger the event
[19:06:39] <esmic> shoky:http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/74hGh/4/
[19:06:43] <quackgyver> I need an actual real jq solution for this but cant find any
[19:07:42] <shoky> quackgyver: you have display:block on the link anyway..
[19:08:36] <quackgyver> shoky: It's just a mockup.
[19:09:12] <quackgyver> I need a jQ solution where the menu doesn't disappear until the user has clicked outside of the popup menu
[19:09:21] <quackgyver> without wrapping everything in a single trigger container
[19:09:42] <Forbidd3n> anyway in jQuery.ajax you can increment jquery ui progress bar?
[19:09:47] <Forbidd3n> as it is loading
[19:10:11] <shoky> Forbidd3n: you can increment the progress bar whenever you want. it has nothing to do with $.ajax
[19:10:44] <Forbidd3n> shoky: I need to increment based on the percentage of data loaded from the ajax post request
[19:12:44] <shoky> Forbidd3n: you'll have to do some stuff on the server to support that.. ajax doesn't give you progress data while loading
[19:15:06] <quackgyver> Nobody knows how to do a proper popup menu?
[19:15:12] <quackgyver> I'm more than willing to pay someone to teach me
[19:15:17] <quackgyver> I just need it done. :/
[19:17:36] <shoky> quackgyver: http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/3/
[19:17:48] <shoky> er forgot smth
[19:19:22] <quackgyver> shoky: That was simple. Thanks a lot!
[19:19:33] <shoky> should be more robust:  http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/5/
[19:20:13] <quackgyver> shoky: Did you intend for clicking to have any effect?
[19:20:22] <shoky> what do you mean?
[19:22:30] <Forbidd3n> shoky: would you happen ot have a sample of what your talking about workign with php
[19:22:46] <shoky> Forbidd3n: nope
[19:22:56] <tw2113> yo shoky
[19:23:05] <shoky> hey tw2113
[19:23:18] <shoky> how's tricks
[19:23:29] <tw2113> same-o
[19:23:35] <tw2113> my ever interesting life :D
[19:24:04] <shoky> sounds familiar
[19:24:52] <tw2113> i am visiting my parents for a week and calling it a vacation
[19:25:22] <quackgyver> shoky: I mean, did you intend for the script to handle clicking on the link, or just hovering?
[19:25:40] <quackgyver> Because clicking on the link is making the popup menu disappear, so I'd like to know if that's a bug or if you simply haven't coded anything for handling clicking
[19:26:27] <shoky> quackgyver: clicking on the link isn't making it disappear, it's just redirecting to another page
[19:27:06] <shoky> i specifically handled clicks on the link, so that they wouldn't propagate and close the popup
[19:27:38] <quackgyver> shoky: Yeah that's what I was trying to figure out.
[19:27:41] <quackgyver> Thanks.
[19:28:42] <shoky> esmic: ok and what's the issue?
[19:37:44] <quackgyver> shoky: Is there a reason why you placed the selectors in variables?
[19:37:51] <quackgyver> Does that have any effect on anything?
[19:39:00] <shoky> quackgyver: so that i wouldn't need to re-query the DOM again and again for selecting the same elements
[19:39:10] <quackgyver> alright, cool. thanks
[19:40:27] <esmic> shoky: issue is the 2 number that get outputted
[19:40:49] <esmic> needs to getsubtracted from each other
[19:41:43] <quackgyver> shoky: I don't quite understand this code. "when mouse is over link, and if form is visible: return"
[19:41:49] <quackgyver> Why does it "return" and nothing else?
[19:42:06] <quackgyver> What does it return?
[19:42:21] <quackgyver> true? false? And what effect would that have?
[19:42:26] <shoky> quackgyver: if the form is visible, then the hover shouldn't do anything (i.e. it shouldn't make the form visible and set a click handler on the document)
[19:42:36] <shoky> it returns undefined
[19:42:49] <quackgyver> Alright, but why is that code even needed then?
[19:43:46] <shoky> cause otherwise, each mouseenter would call .show() on the form again (even though it's already visible), but worse than that - it'd add another event listener on $(document) on each mouseenter
[19:44:42] <quackgyver> Wait let me just see if I understand your code correctly, just so I'm not making any dumb assumptions.
[19:45:29] <quackgyver> Is "form.show().data('visible', true);" a part of the "if hover on link" call?
[19:45:39] <quackgyver> or is that an isolated line
[19:45:50] <shoky> yeah it's part of it
[19:45:53] <quackgyver> ah
[19:45:57] <quackgyver> oooooh
[19:45:58] <quackgyver> okay
[19:46:25] <quackgyver> so return abruptly stops the rest of the code from executing?
[19:46:49] <shoky> yep.  it's the same effect as:    if (!form.data('visible') { ... rest of code here ... }
[19:46:56] <quackgyver> Alright, cool. Thanks for explaining. :)
[19:46:57] <shoky> missing )
[19:47:00] <shoky> np
[19:56:56] <shoky> esmic: and where are you doing the subtraction?
[20:00:20] <nafta> I have a question...it is a weird one...I found a great plugin...a really simple one that calls a function and every content I have on my site with the data-tweetable attr it turns into a link and it opens the share box of twitter and I can get it Tweeted. Now, what I want to ask is...I have another function that add points to the user everytime the user shares something...I want to mix both
[20:00:21] <nafta> functions..is this possible? here is my jsfiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/ErPXq/
[20:00:28] <nafta> Velveeta are you around? :D
[20:00:39] * Velveeta *poofs* out of a magic lamp!
[20:00:44] <nafta> LOL
[20:01:20] <esmic> shoky havent started that part yet
[20:01:28] <esmic> did you get the newst ver
[20:01:51] <shoky> esmic: yes
[20:02:01] <Velveeta> nafta: if you summoned me for that plugin question, i have no clue what the plugins in question are...
[20:02:07] <shoky> or at least the newest one you posted here
[20:02:14] <Velveeta> and i'm not exactly sure how you're wanting to mix them either...
[20:02:31] <nafta> oh
[20:02:31] * Velveeta rolls forward on tank tread, saying "moooore input, stephanie! more input!"
[20:02:41] <shoky> lol
[20:02:42] <nafta> alright
[20:02:48] <esmic> http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/74hGh/4/
[20:02:51] <esmic> yeah this one
[20:03:18] <nafta> Velveeta I just want to get the points...and tweet after wards
[20:03:22] <esmic> i want it to calc on the fly
[20:03:27] <shoky> esmic: yeah, it works fine. try getting it to do what you want.. why are you asking before you've tried?
[20:03:28] <nafta> insert the tweet function inside the other one
[20:03:48] <Velveeta> nafta: so i'm still not sure what the tweet plugin in question is that you're talking about
[20:03:56] <esmic> i tried making it calc
[20:04:35] <esmic> but the one solution i tried it just kept adding as you selected dropdown
[20:05:28] <esmic> *i tried and got to work that is
[20:06:09] <coldhead> nafta: http://jsfiddle.net/ErPXq/1/
[20:06:25] <coldhead> if you change the order and use stopPropogation i *think* you might be able to stop them conflicting
[20:06:34] <coldhead> but it's my first day using jquery
[20:06:48] <tw2113> coldhead, you n00b
[20:06:50] <esmic> i basically want output of the subtraction between the two number in <div id="givetepminussum"></div>
[20:06:52] <Velveeta> nafta: so i'm looking at a tweetable plugin that just seems to display twitter feeds, not actually let you post to them.. you're gonna have to tell me what actual plugins you're using
[20:07:15] <nafta> http://jsfiddle.net/ErPXq/2/
[20:07:19] <nafta> Velveeta there you go
[20:07:22] <nafta> the whole thing
[20:07:53] <nafta> The //END OF PLUGIN marks the place where the plugin ends
[20:08:41] <nafta> basically..all I need to run is the $(function () { $('[data-tweetable]').tweetable({  via: 'jqueryscript', }); });
[20:08:46] <nafta> and it works amazing
[20:08:59] <nafta> problem is...I also want to call the other one
[20:09:10] <nafta> so should I turn the other one into a function with a name
[20:09:11] <nafta> ?
[20:09:23] <nafta> and call it from inside that data-tweetable function?
[20:09:49] <shoky> esmic: here's an example.. http://jsfiddle.net/74hGh/5/
[20:11:10] <nafta> thing is Velveeta I have multiple content which I want to share...so...adding .feed.detacado2 part inside the tweetable function is not a solution...I need to get it the other way around...any ideas?
[20:11:11] <Velveeta> nafta: it looks like all that plugin does is wrap those things in an anchor that makes a call to twitter when clicked, right?
[20:11:26] <nafta> yes
[20:11:38] <Velveeta> so then, how many of those links do you have in your page?
[20:11:47] <nafta> many
[20:11:48] <Velveeta> like, which one are you wanting to use to tweet when that one plugin fires?
[20:11:53] <Velveeta> all of them?
[20:12:02] <esmic> shoky thanks tried something like that but yeah
[20:12:46] <nafta> I have a tweeter feed...that populates...I added the data-tweetable attr to all of the tweets I'm making there...so I can click any of those...and boom..tweet them from the users account
[20:13:01] <EGreg> fo events should I attach listener to document or window?
[20:13:05] <EGreg> let's say mousemove etc
[20:13:08] <EGreg> what's the diff yo
[20:13:08] <nafta> thing is...I also want to give them points for doing that..and that's when the other function gets in Velveeta
[20:13:27] <Velveeta> so anytime they click your tweetable elements, you want to fire that click function also
[20:13:29] <shoky> EGreg: for most events you'd want document
[20:13:33] <Velveeta> to give them points
[20:13:38] <nafta> yes :D
[20:14:07] <EGreg> why
[20:14:09] <EGreg> what's the diff
[20:14:10] <EGreg> erence
[20:14:12] <shoky> EGreg: document is the root element of the DOM. window is not technically an element in the DOM, though it does have some events e.g. resize
[20:14:14] <EGreg> like buffy liked to say
[20:14:18] <Velveeta> then i would tear that click function (that gives them points) out into a named function so you can pass it to your existing .on statement
[20:14:22] <EGreg> oh I got it, thanks! :)
[20:14:25] <nafta> Velveeta but not only that one..I have other click functions other elements with different classes
[20:14:34] <EGreg> document won't have some weird margins right
[20:14:44] <EGreg> that's what I am worried about. I guess that is the <body>
[20:14:46] <Velveeta> and in addition, do something like this: $(document).on('click', 'a.tweetable', namedFunction);
[20:14:57] <EGreg> thanks! that's as good as sex.
[20:14:59] <Velveeta> so you set up a live listener for any of those anchors to be clicked on
[20:14:59] <EGreg> It works :)
[20:15:11] <Velveeta> and any future anchors that might work their way into the document, if it's a live feed
[20:15:20] <nafta> it is live yes
[20:15:30] <Velveeta> then that should work just fine
[20:15:43] <Velveeta> just pull that anonymous function out and give it a name, like function clickPoints or something
[20:15:46] <nafta> damn I'll try to understand what you told me and add it
[20:15:49] <Velveeta> and pass clickPoints to your existing click handler
[20:16:01] <nafta> Velveeta you mean the tweet function?
[20:16:06] <Velveeta> as well as setting up a separate click listener on the document like i showed above, for all a.tweetable elements
[20:16:13] <Velveeta> no, the one you're using to give points
[20:16:22] <Velveeta> leave the tweetable plugin alone
[20:16:43] <nafta> but I have many of those with different selectors
[20:16:48] <Velveeta> pro tip: it's always best to leave 3rd party code alone whenever possible, for ease of upgrading in the future
[20:16:57] <nafta> oh ok
[20:16:59] <Velveeta> you have many of what?
[20:17:13] <Velveeta> the tweetable links?
[20:17:37] <nafta> yes I have $.(".feed.destacado2 then I have another text area named $.(".feed.destacado2 and I give them...more points for that area...etc
[20:17:41] <Velveeta> you're not passing a linkClass parameter to the plugin, so it's using its default linkClass to wrap all of them, and the default linkClass is "tweetable"
[20:17:53] <nafta> that's why I thought that getting that tweetable function a name was the right thing to do
[20:18:01] <Velveeta> nafta: so are they all using the same callback function to give points?
[20:18:09] <Velveeta> like are you copy and pasting that function around to all of them?
[20:18:33] <nafta> that doesn't sound good
[20:18:39] <nafta> but yes
[20:18:40] <Velveeta> it's a question
[20:18:50] <nafta> I have 4 areas
[20:18:54] <nafta> to be shared
[20:19:00] <Velveeta> then this is a perfect time to learn DRY - don't repeat yourself
[20:19:20] <Velveeta> if you have a function that you're copying around to multiple places, declare it once as a named function, and pass the name in multiple places
[20:21:40] <nafta> alright
[20:21:43] <nafta> I'll try to fix it
[20:21:45] <nafta> hold on
[20:21:47] <Velveeta> ok
[20:23:53] <prbc> Hi, I'm a novice programmer and I'm craving to contribute with jQuery Foundation projects. But I'm don't know where to start
[20:24:15] <prbc> I just read the guidelines and I looked at some issues
[20:24:36] <prbc> Some of them are just text correction
[20:24:48] <prbc> Should I make a pull request to fix this? '-'
[20:25:18] <Velveeta> have you signed their agreements yet?
[20:25:36] <Velveeta> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[20:25:47] <prbc> Yes!"
[20:26:17] <Velveeta> then yeah, as far as i know, you should just be able to fork the project, patch those issues, and issue a pull request
[20:26:28] <Velveeta> make sure you read their style guidelines also, they're pretty stringent about that i believe
[20:26:48] <Velveeta> when you have hundreds+ working on a project, you kinda have to be ;)
[20:27:29] <prbc> I read it, but I'm a little afraid from patching something like this
[20:27:51] <Velveeta> well, if all else fails, just remember that you can't screw up the core project yourself :)
[20:27:54] <prbc> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/34
[20:27:54] <b-ot> prbc: Issue #34 by jwatkin (6mon 4d ago): Typo in "Create New Ticket" text
[20:28:09] <Velveeta> because they have to approve your code before pulling it into the core project, so you can only screw it up with their help ;)
[20:28:09] <prbc> b-ot: omg, i was talking about that hahaha
[20:28:21] <Velveeta> prbc: b-ot is a channel bot ;)
[20:28:36] <prbc> lol
[20:29:39] <prbc> Velveeta: how about this issue, should I fix it?
[20:29:43] <Erneston> hello
[20:30:11] <prbc> Erneston: hi
[20:30:13] <Velveeta> prbc: so i haven't personally started contributing to either jquery or jquery ui yet.. i plan to in the near future, but i figured i'd get my feet wet w/ the community to giving assistance in here for a while
[20:30:32] <Velveeta> at least until i can get my work/home schedule settled to a point that i can dedicate some time to tickets :D
[20:30:44] <Velveeta> so to answer your question, i don't know.. i'm not sure how they prioritize what should be fixed when
[20:31:01] <Erneston> can anyone help: http://jsfiddle.net/asjVz/5/  <---- am trying to give the X and Y position but only one axis works, try moving the mouse around the page (working with -webkit-)
[20:31:01] <Velveeta> however, there is a #jquery-dev channel that could probably answer that for you more specifically
[20:31:26] <prbc> Velveeta: wow, thanks. I will ask there
[20:31:53] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[20:32:09] <Velveeta> erneston: i'm showing both axis values in your output
[20:32:29] <Velveeta> the little image chunk only seems to be moving along the X axis, but the event.clientX/Y output is showing both
[20:32:43] <Erneston> i cant figure out why it moves only on 1 axis
[20:32:55] <Erneston> i thought it had to do with it only  reading the first variable
[20:36:27] <Velveeta> erneston: here you go, you should be passing a string value, not that parentheses-comma-separated one: http://jsfiddle.net/asjVz/11/
[20:37:00] <Erneston> thanx
[20:37:05] <Velveeta> no problem
[20:37:07] <Erneston>  let me break it and make it again
[20:37:12] <Velveeta> heheheh
[20:37:27] <jtm> I am running into a big issue. I have a web server setup on a non-standard port with a non-www subdomain. I am calling within the same domain and port an ajax call using $.ajax. I am setting cookies server-side, but it seems that the ajax call isn't setting cookies on the current domain. Except when I check the ajax call itself, it has cookies set for only that URL, but not for the URL that
[20:37:27] <jtm> called it.
[20:37:45] <jtm> I have xhrFields: { withCredentials: true }, but that does nothing.
[20:38:02] <quackgyver> shoky: Would you mind helping me understand the last part? link.add(form).on('click', function(e) {
[20:38:08] <quackgyver> It just contains e.stopPropagation();
[20:38:18] <quackgyver> which I recall being used to stop anchors from redirecting
[20:38:26] <quackgyver> but then why is this applied to an "add()" function regarding the form?
[20:39:02] <Velveeta> quackgyver: it's actually being applied to 'link' in that case
[20:39:12] <Velveeta> link.add() returns link, not form
[20:39:32] <quackgyver> oh yeah
[20:40:00] <quackgyver> What does add() do? I don't understand the official description.
[20:40:16] <Velveeta> jtm: can you give us an example of like "page on domain.com is calling domain2.com and cookie is being set for domain2 on server" or whatever ?
[20:40:19] <quackgyver> Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .add() method constructs a new jQuery object from the union of those elements and the ones passed into the method.
[20:40:26] <quackgyver> This is like... the most unfriendly definition I've ever read.
[20:40:30] <quackgyver> Can't make sense of it.
[20:40:41] <jtm> Velveeta There is no cross-domain calls.
[20:41:02] <jtm> Velveeta It's just that the cookie is only being set for the path for only the ajax call.
[20:41:10] <Velveeta> well, you should be able to make cross-domain calls w/ $.ajax, it should fall back to its jsonp method of loading the page
[20:41:22] <quackgyver> Also, shouldn't it stop link from triggering?
[20:41:24] <jtm> I'm thinking this is a server issue, and not a ajax issue.
[20:41:27] <jtm> an*
[20:41:28] <quackgyver> Because it still triggers
[20:41:40] <jtm> server-side that is.
[20:42:44] <Velveeta> quackgyver: also, that definition is right, i was smoking crack.. link.add(form) returns a collection of both link and form, not just link…
[20:43:08] <Erneston> can you tell me Velveeta why it doesnt work without the px ?
[20:43:09] <quackgyver> What does that mean? "returns a collection"?
[20:43:12] <Velveeta> so it should kill the click event's default action for both link and form
[20:43:13] <quackgyver> What does this mean in effect
[20:43:33] <quackgyver> Alright. Well, it doesnt' stop the click :/
[20:43:41] <Erneston> i tried a string earlier but without the 'px' at the end
[20:43:41] <Velveeta> quackgyver: it means it returns both, like if you did $('div'), it would return a collection of all divs in the page… link.add(form) returns a collection of both link and form
[20:44:00] <quackgyver> Oh, okay.
[20:44:02] <Velveeta> erneston: it expects a measurement: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-mask-position
[20:44:29] <quackgyver> So what it does is... "if user clicks on link or form, do nothing"?
[20:44:31] <Erneston> already there
[20:44:39] <Erneston> i was using:  30, 100;
[20:44:43] <Erneston> earlier without the px
[20:45:20] <jtm> Velveeta I had to set the path on the cookie to be '/', seems to have fixed it.
[20:45:22] <Erneston> i thought that would translate as 30%
[20:45:23] <Velveeta> jtm: so let me make sure i'm deciphering your problem… for example, if your domain is nonwww.domain.com:8080, you're making an ajax request from that page to the same nonwww.domain.com:8080 address right?
[20:45:35] <Velveeta> jtm: oh, well, good to hear you sorted it out then :)
[20:45:47] <Erneston> 'With a value pair of 0% 0%, (is equal to 0 0) '
[20:45:53] <Velveeta> quackgyver: not "do nothing" but "don't do your default action"
[20:46:17] <quackgyver> Velveeta: Well, why would one want to apply that to the form element?
[20:46:25] <quackgyver> Also, it doesn't work as intended.
[20:46:33] <Velveeta> quackgyver: no clue, it ain't my code :D
[20:46:35] <quackgyver> Becuase clicking on the link still redirects the user.
[20:46:59] <Velveeta> erneston: i don't see a use case on the MDN page for just <number> <number>
[20:47:00] <quackgyver> Hm, alright. Maybe shoky will know then.
[20:47:01] <quackgyver> Thanks.
[20:47:29] <Velveeta> erneston: only for <number>% <number>% or <number><unit: e.g. px, cm, etc> <number><unit>
[20:47:38] <Velveeta> or words like left center
[20:48:28] <Erneston> difficult enough understanding these manuals
[20:48:30] <Velveeta> quackgyver: i have no context here or else i might be able to help… i only have 1 line of code you put in the room, so i can only tell you how it reads
[20:49:00] <quackgyver> Velveeta: Alright, Here's the example: http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/5/
[20:49:43] <Velveeta> oh well there's the problem :D
[20:50:01] <quackgyver> ?
[20:50:03] <Velveeta> for some reason i kept thinking the event function being called was preventDefault, not stopPropagation
[20:50:12] <Velveeta> that's only keeping the event from bubbling further up the dom
[20:50:18] <Velveeta> but it doesn't prevent its default action
[20:50:32] <quackgyver> oh
[20:50:51] <Velveeta> and it's probably killing the bubbling to prevent the .one() click handler from firing at the body level and hiding the form
[20:50:54] <EGreg> I DID IT BABY
[20:51:29] <quackgyver> Hm. I don't know what that means, but I take it that I need to keep it?
[20:51:38] <Velveeta> rightio
[20:51:51] <quackgyver> Alright, cool. Thanks.
[20:51:59] <Velveeta> what it means is that after you click on any part of that link or form, the event would bubble up to the document level
[20:52:15] <Velveeta> and at that level there's an event listener that says "any click i receive, hide the form"
[20:52:29] <Velveeta> but in the case of clicking on the link or the form itself, you want to stop that from happening, so you stopPropagtation
[20:52:40] <Velveeta> egreg: what did you did?
[20:53:24] <quackgyver> Oooh, okay, I get it.
[20:53:26] <quackgyver> Thanks a lot.
[20:53:32] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[20:53:43] <Erneston> thanx again
[20:53:47] <Erneston> managed to save my sanity
[20:54:10] <Velveeta> heheh
[20:54:19] <Erneston> maanged to centre it now :D
[20:54:44] <Velveeta> oh yeah, i would have done that for you also, i was thinking about it because it would look better, but then got sidetracked on other issues :D
[20:54:54] <Erneston> i learnt something though
[20:54:56] <Erneston> was about to ask
[20:55:13] <Erneston> but i figured it out
[20:55:15] <EGreg> http://pastie.org/private/dwxipbhvsnlyrxeyrtyjqw
[20:55:19] <EGreg> this is what I did baby :)
[20:55:32] <EGreg> looks like it worked, too
[20:55:36] <Erneston> am still learning to use jquery
[20:55:44] <Erneston> the js language as a whole
[20:55:54] <Erneston> very basics still, but am exploring
[20:56:24] <Velveeta> well kudos :)
[20:56:43] <Erneston> where is a good channel to chat about ideas or get thelp on concepts?
[20:57:31] <Velveeta> egreg: nice work, i actually have a ticket at work that i was looking to have to do something similar
[20:57:39] <Velveeta> erneston: right here?
[20:57:47] <shoky> quackgyver: Velveeta: link.add(form)  returns both the link and the form
[20:58:14] <Velveeta> shoky: rightio
[21:01:04] <Erneston> is it better to use image or svg image for masking images?
[21:01:55] <Velveeta> that i have no opinion on, i've never really had to do that sort of thing before
[21:02:10] <Velveeta> i would think an image would be better as it has wider support
[21:02:19] <Velveeta> i know older android phones don't do well with svg's
[21:02:57] <Erneston> ill try svg's
[21:05:51] <esmic> i got another wacky question: can you alter something specific inside a div <div>1,2,3,6,7,23,1</div> fx adding +1 to the first number so it´ll be 2 instead
[21:06:58] <Erneston> Velveeta how would you have centred the image?
[21:07:10] <Erneston> i used margins
[21:07:22] <Velveeta> erneston: i would have just subtracted half the width and height of the mask
[21:07:33] <Erneston> margin?
[21:07:39] <Erneston> or the mask background position?
[21:07:53] <Erneston> i could not get the backgorund position to work without the margin
[21:08:09] <Erneston> http://jsfiddle.net/asjVz/27/
[21:08:11] <Erneston> this is what i did
[21:08:11] <Velveeta> esmic: var numArray = div.text().split(','); numArray[0]++; div.text(numArray.join(','));
[21:08:22] <Erneston> if you know another way pls tell me
[21:10:55] <esmic> valveeta ty
[21:11:04] <Velveeta> no problem
[21:11:15] <Velveeta> ernestone: my method would have involved knowing the dimensions of the mask itself
[21:11:28] <Velveeta> and then just subtract half its width and height from the mask position calculation
[21:11:32] <esmic> how you seen this get used somewhere pls throw a url
[21:11:37] <Velveeta> so the way you did it looks pretty good
[21:11:39] <esmic> how=have
[21:12:01] <Velveeta> esmic: i haven't seen that used anywhere...
[21:12:40] <Erneston> pls check out my example
[21:12:50] <Velveeta> i did
[21:13:00] <Erneston> you would have used different property?
[21:13:48] <Velveeta> like i said, my method would have involved knowing the dimensions of the mask in advance, and subtracting half the width/height from the -webkit-mask-position at the time it was calculated
[21:14:20] <Velveeta> your method does essentially the same thing, but with negative margin instead
[21:14:26] <Erneston> i was half way there with that method
[21:14:52] <Velveeta> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/asjVz/28/
[21:15:15] <Erneston> so no css required
[21:15:20] <Erneston> all done in the jquery
[21:15:25] <Velveeta> right
[21:15:28] <Erneston> arrr
[21:15:38] <Erneston> i was changing mask-position in the css originally
[21:15:40] <Velveeta> although, you could probably offload it to the gpu for better performance in the css
[21:16:01] <Erneston> ok your lost me
[21:16:10] <Erneston> beginner here
[21:16:31] <Erneston> you mean less stress with the css margin option ?
[21:17:17] <Erneston> upon learning jquery am finding many things are capable with css now, spending a lot of time deciding which method to use
[21:17:20] <Erneston> and for what reasons
[21:18:55] <Velveeta> erneston: http://jsfiddle.net/asjVz/32/
[21:19:18] <Erneston> getting fancy now
[21:19:19] <Erneston> translate3d :S
[21:19:23] <Velveeta> so, using certain css properties sends those requests to the cpu
[21:19:26] <Erneston> wtf
[21:19:36] <Velveeta> things like top: 10, left: 10, etc
[21:19:50] <Erneston> is my margin a bad solution then ?
[21:19:57] <Erneston> it seems like you have many other ways
[21:19:59] <Velveeta> but using certain other properties sends those to the gpu to be processed
[21:20:17] <Velveeta> which means it can run in parallel w/ the cpu trying to crunch numbers to figure out how to position stuff
[21:20:33] <Erneston> i dont know about this stuf
[21:20:36] <Erneston> stuff*
[21:20:40] <Velveeta> and that translates to a boost in speed in rendering, and less painting going on in the browser, because the gpu is just shifting pixels around
[21:20:47] <Velveeta> well, that's why i'm telling you this stuff :D
[21:20:57] <Erneston> how can i learn more, in dummy talk
[21:21:01] <Velveeta> here, there was a pretty awesome presentation given on this sort of thing recently by paul irish
[21:21:28] <Velveeta> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAqjyCH_LOE
[21:21:34] <Erneston> is there a unoffical do and dont list ?
[21:21:44] <Velveeta> i have no idea
[21:21:49] <Erneston> which helps you make better decisions
[21:21:56] <Erneston> when to use jquery or css
[21:22:00] <Erneston> margin or transform
[21:22:00] <Velveeta> i just read a lot of articles and watch and listen to a lot of video content
[21:22:19] <EGreg> this is awesome: http://help.dottoro.com/
[21:22:19] <Velveeta> well, the rule of thumb is don't use jquery to animate properties whenever you can do it with css instead
[21:22:19] <EGreg> no?
[21:22:46] <Velveeta> so if you can use css transitions for animations, definitely do it as opposed to animating something like a left-offset with javascript
[21:23:00] <Velveeta> egreg: i'm not sure if that's awesome or not, it's the first time i've seen it myself
[21:23:11] <Erneston> when is jquery still a solution for animation over css? ignoring browser support
[21:23:18] <Velveeta> egreg: you might like this site also: http://devdocs.io/
[21:23:37] <Velveeta> ernestone: when it's variable properties that you want to animate, that you don't know at design time
[21:23:51] <Erneston> ohh nice
[21:23:53] <Velveeta> like, sometimes you know that e.g. when this item is clicked, i want it to slide out 20px to the right
[21:24:02] <quackgyver> Velveeta: I'm tryign to make the link not trigger by using event.stoppropagation
[21:24:12] <quackgyver> but its not working. any ideas off the top of your head based on the code youve seen before?
[21:24:14] <Velveeta> but other times, you don't know that kind of detail at design time, you only know that when this is clicked, i want it to move to this other location on the screen
[21:24:43] <Velveeta> quackgyver: event.preventDefault() will stop the link from actually redirecting the page, if that's what you mean
[21:24:56] <quackgyver> yeah
[21:25:32] <Velveeta> erneston: so if you know that you just want it to slide out to the right by 20px, you can do that in css fairly easily, but if it's something variable, like "i want it to move to this other element's position when it's clicked on" but you don't know where that element is going to be, then you'd have to animate that with js
[21:26:07] <quackgyver> Velveeta: Then why isn't this working? http://jsfiddle.net/PHW96/6/
[21:26:10] <quackgyver> Am I doing something wrong?
[21:26:39] <Velveeta> quackgyver: yes, you're not calling event.preventDefault() like i said :D
[21:27:10] <quackgyver> oh
[21:27:36] <quackgyver> thanks
[21:27:41] <Velveeta> did it work?
[21:28:10] <Erneston> i have recently had to use small animations / gifs
[21:28:25] <Erneston> i have found that if i z-index one above the other it prevents it from playing
[21:29:00] <Erneston> any advice on gifs? they appear to slow down and run as un planned
[21:29:15] <Velveeta> for animated gifs, no advice
[21:29:33] <Velveeta> i have some animated gifs load slowly for me, and i have a 50Mb pipe
[21:29:59] <Velveeta> as far as z-index being above an animated gif and preventing it from playing, that may be a browser optimization
[21:30:13] <Velveeta> if it assumes the gif is covered up and out of view, it may not animate it to save cpu cycles
[21:30:26] <Erneston> i may run a test soon to see how smooth the same animation runs in css slideshow
[21:30:41] <Erneston> overlayed but with opacity reduced
[21:30:55] <Erneston> so technically it could be trying to save
[21:31:01] <Velveeta> right
[21:31:15] <Velveeta> at least that would be my guess
[21:31:30] <Velveeta> there are other presentations in that perfmatters series that go over how the browser rendering engines work
[21:31:40] <Velveeta> and how they try to optimize what to render and when and how and all that
[21:31:53] <Velveeta> the whole thing was about 3 1/2 hours, and it was great
[21:32:13] <Velveeta> we gathered all of our front end engineers in a room and had a work/video-watching session with it up on a screen, totally worth it
[21:32:18] <Erneston> i find this how stuff works interesting
[21:32:52] <Velveeta> there was one guy that did his entire presentation in pirate speak, because the conference itself was on sep. 19th
[21:33:00] <Erneston> so your sitting in the room as am watching it?
[21:33:16] <Velveeta> his presentation was on static memory pools in javascript, which was a bit hard to follow in pirate speak :D
[21:33:34] <Velveeta> no, we watched this a month or so ago
[21:33:46] <Velveeta> and all gathered in a single room to watch it as a group while we worked
[21:34:43] <Erneston> maybe you can give me some ideas
[21:34:56] <Velveeta> on?
[21:35:18] <Erneston> we have to make a interactive website experience
[21:35:21] <Erneston> not a general website
[21:35:34] <Erneston> but something using jquery/css and is 'interactive' and 'fun'
[21:35:54] <Erneston> am trying to think of ways the user can interact which are fun
[21:36:03] <Erneston> thats why i was creating that masking thing
[21:36:16] <Velveeta> when you say "we" is this like for a class or a company or what?
[21:36:23] <Erneston> class
[21:36:27] <Erneston> but I am on my own
[21:36:36] <Velveeta> gotcha
[21:36:41] <Erneston> rather than click a link
[21:36:49] <Velveeta> so, have you looked into jquery ui?
[21:36:54] <Erneston> yeah
[21:37:03] <Erneston> hide show, shake
[21:37:10] <Velveeta> that's a premade library of interactive widgets
[21:37:12] <Erneston> probably need a refresher on that
[21:37:15] <Velveeta> right, those are some of the effects
[21:37:26] <Velveeta> but there are widget components themselves like dialogs, accordions, etc
[21:37:37] <EGreg> thanks Velveeta :)
[21:37:37] <Erneston> i was playing with modals
[21:37:38] <Velveeta> that add some interactivity to the page fairly easily
[21:37:55] <Erneston> my theme is horror film festival
[21:37:56] <Velveeta> egreg: no problem, i haven't made extensive use of that site myself yet, but it was recommended to me in here a couple weeks ago :)
[21:38:22] <Velveeta> ahhhh horror.. what a great genre :D
[21:38:32] <Erneston> i was thinking of using webcam to capture the viewer
[21:38:36] <Erneston> and use the image in some way
[21:39:05] <Velveeta> that could be fun
[21:39:17] <Erneston> do you remember kali's power goo?
[21:39:30] <Velveeta> don't think i've ever heard of it
[21:39:40] <Erneston> basically you morph a photo of the mona lisa
[21:40:02] <Erneston> in the ring, photos of people cursed are morphed
[21:40:14] <Erneston> see what am getting at?
[21:40:18] <Velveeta> yepyep
[21:40:30] <Erneston> how the hell could i do this?
[21:40:40] <Velveeta> you can also look into something like paper.js to give you some out-of-the-box drawing/morphing functionality
[21:40:42] <Velveeta> http://paperjs.org/examples/
[21:40:54] <Erneston> thxn
[21:40:57] <Erneston> let me look
[21:41:39] <Erneston> am trying to make interaction slightly different
[21:41:54] <Erneston> do you remember the old maze game?
[21:42:04] <Velveeta> which one?
[21:42:09] <Erneston> exorcist
[21:42:37] <Erneston> http://paperjs.org/examples/nyan-rainbow/ WOWWW
[21:42:38] <Erneston> i love it
[21:42:39] <Velveeta> is that the one that on the 2nd or 3rd screen when you had to pay really close attention to a narrow hallway, it would pop up a face and scream at you to make you jump?
[21:43:02] <Erneston> yeah
[21:43:06] <Erneston> :)
[21:43:08] <Velveeta> yes i remember that one :D
[21:43:15] <Erneston> bascially i like the concept
[21:43:19] <Erneston> of scaring the audience
[21:43:26] <Velveeta> if you wanna see a really splendiforous stuff you can do with html5 and the canvas, using webgl...
[21:43:44] <Velveeta> check out ellie goulding's "lights" site, catchy mix of that song on there too
[21:43:51] <Erneston> am also trying to think of ways to use technology
[21:43:54] <Erneston> eg: webcam
[21:43:54] <Velveeta> http://lights.elliegoulding.com/
[21:43:59] <Erneston> thats lights was good
[21:44:07] <Erneston> made me listen to the entire song
[21:44:21] <Velveeta> towards the end of it, they pull in twitter search results to render on the canvas also
[21:44:22] <Erneston> reminded me of nights on the sega saturn
[21:44:34] <Erneston> ill have to re watch it
[21:44:43] <Velveeta> and that's all entirely javascript and a canvas element
[21:45:01] <esmic> its crazy
[21:45:09] <Erneston> am looking at more examples
[21:45:17] <Erneston> am trying to think of something to fit my theme
[21:50:50] <Erneston> do you like horror?
[21:51:25] <Velveeta> tomorrow's my wedding anniversary ;)
[21:51:42] <Velveeta> so yeah, we're all about halloween, and horror in general :)
[21:52:01] <Erneston> dress up?
[21:52:33] <Velveeta> for the wedding?
[21:52:39] <Velveeta> or just for halloween in general?
[21:52:42] <Erneston> either
[21:52:51] <Velveeta> last year i was danny devito's penguin, tomorrow i'll be mike ditka :D
[21:52:57] <Velveeta> for the wedding i was beetlejuice
[21:53:04] <Velveeta> in a maroon velvet tux ;)
[21:53:22] <Erneston> so you are a horror fan
[21:53:29] <Velveeta> yassir
[21:53:38] <Erneston> damn
[21:53:40] <Erneston> shame its late
[21:53:47] <Erneston> you could probably inspire me
[21:54:01] <Erneston> creative block
[21:54:18] <Velveeta> some of my favorites, and some are funnier than others of course, are like hellraiser 1-3, critters and leprechaun 1-infinity, nightmare on elm streets
[21:54:20] <Erneston> need to get the cogs turning
[21:54:25] <Velveeta> i love freddy's sense of humor
[21:54:36] <Erneston> you may really be able to help then
[21:54:42] <Erneston> freddy is included in this
[21:54:50] <Erneston> am using classics
[21:54:52] <Erneston> mostly
[21:55:02] <Erneston> texas chainsaw
[21:55:12] <Velveeta> just about any zombie movie in existence
[21:55:19] <Velveeta> i really enjoyed the dawn of the dead remake
[21:55:21] <Erneston> how could you bring freddy to the web?
[21:55:25] <Erneston> as an experience
[21:55:33] <Velveeta> not sure
[21:55:59] <Erneston> can jquery open your cd rom drive? lol
[21:56:05] <Velveeta> heheheh no
[21:56:13] <Erneston> what would freddy do
[21:56:17] <Erneston> to your computer
[21:56:25] <Erneston> i have thought of browser crash or format
[21:56:35] <Velveeta> probably make it sprout legs and a head
[21:56:39] <Erneston> lol
[21:56:44] <Velveeta> and ram your head into the monitor
[21:57:02] <Erneston> freddy likes games
[21:57:24] <Velveeta> you know who else does?
[21:57:30] <Velveeta> one of my favorite villains of all time, jigsaw
[21:57:49] <Erneston> interesting, i was including saw, but lack of ideas, stopped it
[21:57:58] <Velveeta> i love those saw movies
[21:58:03] <Erneston> first is my fav
[21:58:08] <Velveeta> definitely
[21:58:19] <Erneston> could the viewers be playing a game
[21:58:24] <Velveeta> i had to explain to a coworker recently why i loved zombie movies so much
[21:58:44] <Velveeta> because he was like "i don't understand you zombie people, it's always the same movie over and over, why would you want to watch that?"
[21:59:06] <Erneston> zombies aint my thing , but i understand each niche
[21:59:08] <Velveeta> and i was like "dude, you don't watch zombie movies for the zombies.. well i mean partially you do.. you watch zombie movies to see humanity turn on itself"
[21:59:22] <Velveeta> group dynamics are a major factor in every one of em
[21:59:41] <Erneston> didnt realise , haven't watched enough of them
[21:59:42] <Velveeta> you get to see the worst qualities of people surface as they feed their own friends to the hoarde to gain an extra 2 seconds to run away
[22:00:12] <Erneston> i was thinking of a spiralling illusion
[22:00:25] <Erneston> am lost
[22:00:36] <Velveeta> sure, you could tailor something like that to the old hitchcock vertigo film
[22:00:47] <Erneston> it was for saw
[22:00:50] <Erneston> the red circles
[22:00:52] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[22:00:57] <Erneston> shit idea
[22:01:03] <Erneston> not sure what to do with saw
[22:01:15] <Erneston> apart from play animation asking them to play a game of pong
[22:01:24] <Erneston> then give them a game to play
[22:01:27] <Erneston> but saw cheats
[22:01:30] <Erneston> and uses 1000 balls
[22:01:39] <Erneston> you cant beat saw
[22:01:43] <Velveeta> heheheh
[22:01:50] <Erneston> its abit shit the idea
[22:02:15] <Velveeta> well all ideas are shit, until they're not
[22:02:25] <Erneston> i cant grab anything from saw
[22:02:26] <Velveeta> just keep working on it
[22:02:32] <Velveeta> not necessarily saw
[22:02:35] <Erneston> been so many
[22:02:37] <Velveeta> but your horror theme in general
[22:02:45] <Erneston> no choice but to work on it
[22:02:51] <Velveeta> you could give them a countdown
[22:02:55] <Velveeta> and some task to perform
[22:03:02] <Erneston> funny, you say count down
[22:03:31] <Erneston> task: 1 tutor has a key in his arse
[22:03:38] <Erneston> remove it to win
[22:03:50] <Erneston> the game begins
[22:03:54] <Velveeta> heheheh
[22:04:12] <Erneston> my wierd humour kicks in
[22:04:17] <Erneston> i like sadistic movies
[22:04:26] <Velveeta> have you seen audition?
[22:04:34] <Erneston> love it
[22:04:38] <Velveeta> heheheh
[22:04:43] <Erneston> only thing i can thing of from that are
[22:04:45] <Erneston> the bag
[22:04:47] <Erneston> and the foot
[22:04:50] <Velveeta> that bag was fucked up
[22:05:01] <Velveeta> the foot scene was awesome… and the piano wire
[22:05:05] <Erneston> people would not get audition though, its not main stream enough
[22:05:17] <davidjonat> hi
[22:05:17] <Erneston> 1 dvd i wont lend anyone
[22:05:30] <Erneston> i mostly watch foreign horror
[22:06:31] <Velveeta> davidjonat: heya
[22:06:56] <Erneston> i like this task idea
[22:07:08] <Erneston> not sure what happens at the end
[22:07:16] <Velveeta> their computer explodes
[22:07:29] <Erneston> i thought of faking that
[22:07:42] <Velveeta> $(window).explode(); it's a jquery plugin, blows up their entire computer and anything within about a 3ft radius
[22:07:46] <Erneston> need someone to lose an eye or something
[22:07:59] <Erneston> or little jigsaw can ride in on a bike
[22:08:04] <Erneston> :0
[22:08:06] <Erneston> :)
[22:08:32] <Velveeta> ok i'm out for the night, gotta be back up in 5 1/2 hours
[22:08:39] <Erneston> thanx for the advice
[22:08:41] <Erneston> nite
[22:08:45] <Velveeta> no problem, good luck
[22:08:59] <Erneston> tnx
[22:28:41] <ilovecode121212> sudo reboot
[22:28:44] <ilovecode121212> woops
[22:33:22] <winsoff> What does jquery do that javascript does not do?
[22:33:36] <winsoff> As in, what does it give javascript devs the tools for that were cumbersome before?
[23:05:23] <nafta> any of you guys know how to get images from a folder thru jquery'
[23:05:24] <nafta> ?
[23:06:21] <ServerSage> Is there an event that fires when something is loaded/drawn?  In other words, when an <input> is added to the DOM, is there an event for that?  I'm using .live, and want to tie an event to an element loading.
[23:19:24] <quackgyver> shoky, Velveeta, I managed to get my solution working just the way I wanted thanks to both of you. I've been struggling to get this done for several days, so you saved me a lot of trouble and many headaches.
[23:19:29] <quackgyver> So thanks a lot.
[23:51:12] <zquad> yo how do I click the fancybox from a button inside the fancybox inline
[23:51:14] <zquad> ??
