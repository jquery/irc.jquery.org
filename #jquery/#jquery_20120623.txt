[00:01:38] <Whirl3d_> Lost123, if you make a working fiddle (with html, css, and js), I'll look at it.  pastie, pastebin, etc. just don't work for me...
[00:01:57] <Lost123> Whirl3d_:  ok
[00:02:25] <Lost123> Whirl3d_: i need to know that we call a function on an event like click right
[00:02:45] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: Like this http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/hgurk/19/
[00:02:50] <Lost123> is that possible that we call it with click event, and call it just when the last slide appears?
[00:03:01] <Lost123> without click*
[00:04:30] <Whirl3d_> kennett85, no. gimme a second and I'll find you an example
[00:04:56] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: OK thanks
[00:05:04] <Whirl3d_> http://think2loud.com/653-jquery-document-ready-howto/
[00:06:38] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hgurk/22/
[00:07:21] <Whirl3d_> put that in the <head> of your document right after you put the <script> tags that load jquery  also, it goes in its own <script> tag...
[00:09:59] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: Is this what you meant?
[00:11:11] <Whirl3d_> ?
[00:11:50] <kennett85> http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/hgurk/23/
[00:12:02] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: Sorry
[00:13:34] <Whirl3d_> as long as it's after the <script src='jquery'></script><script> INSERT FIDDLE SCRIPT HERE</script>  and put it in the <head> portion of your doc before the body
[00:15:49] <Murg|e> Anyone able to provide some assistance on saving the positions of jquery connected lists to mysql?
[00:16:25] <Lost123> how can i attach my custom js script in jsfiddle
[00:18:11] <Whirl3d_> lost123, on the left, there's an assets tab. enter the url to the script and click +
[00:18:46] <Whirl3d_> murgie, if you make a working example at jsfiddle and share the link here, you are much more likely to get help.
[00:21:49] <Lost123> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/5/
[00:25:13] <Whirl3d_> Lost123, I'm just going to go to google and type in the name of your scipt while you sit back and  eat bonbons and wait for me to do the same thing you could do yourself. brb
[00:25:52] <Lost123> Whirl3d_: i am trying to replace the html of navi whne the last slide plays
[00:25:59] <Lost123> i googled myself too
[00:26:08] <Lost123> i will show you the homepage of script
[00:29:06] <Lost123> http://www.jquerytools.org/documentation/tabs/slideshow.html Whirl3d_
[00:31:46] <melvinram> Why does http://jsfiddle.net/SRuzE/5/ work and http://jsfiddle.net/7RDZu/ doesn't?
[00:32:32] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: u did that ?  thanks a lot ....
[00:32:46] <melvinram> They are essentially the same except one is nested inside a few elements
[00:33:09] <Lost123> Whirl3d_:  i have updated the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/6/
[00:39:56] <luketmillar> Reason the second one doesn't work is because the DOM ignores all non-table elements inside a table
[00:40:11] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: It works but now the total at the bottom won't update when a box is checked.
[00:40:33] <luketmillar> The HTMLelement input that you have does not see the form as its parent
[00:40:48] <luketmillar> Because form is not a valid child of <table>
[00:40:56] <luketmillar> So it just ignores it
[00:41:41] <melvinram> luketmillar: ya i just figured that out by trying http://jsfiddle.net/SRuzE/6/
[00:42:10] <luketmillar> Cool
[00:42:15] <melvinram> luketmillar: thanks for looking at it
[00:43:10] <kennett85> Heres my new code http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/WCDpe/
[00:44:16] <Murg|e> Thanks Whirl3d_. I put some code up at http://jsfiddle.net/S8TS2/ for anyone that may be able to assist with saving connected list positions to mysql. Thx.
[00:47:32] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hgurk/24/
[00:48:49] <Whirl3d_> kennett85, every time a click event happens and the checkbox is toggled, the updateTotal function gets run. It finds all the checked inputs and adds their totals. Then puts the number int he "TOTAL" div. you do with it what you need to get it to show up on your site correctly.
[00:49:46] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: Thanks for your help
[00:50:28] <Whirl3d_> np. gl your site is lookin good, btw
[00:50:56] <Lost123> http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/14/ here is the updated one Whirl3d_
[00:51:15] <kennett85> Thanx

[02:10:20] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/59/ can anyone let me know the solution in here ?
[02:10:51] <rabbi1> i am trying to validate elements on tab1 and then allow the user to navigate to tab2 on validating the tab1
[02:19:36] <shoky> rabbi1
[02:21:18] <shoky> use the tabs 'select' event.   e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/TTTLw/60/
[02:24:32] <shoky> kennett85: i dont see you adding any commas anywhere. also, your use of .on() is wrong
[02:24:48] <shoky> ah sorry i misread, its ok
[02:27:45] <Lost123> http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/31/
[02:27:57] <Lost123> cannot call the function onPause
[02:28:08] <Lost123> the slideshow stops when i call it
[02:29:14] <jonno11> Lost123: can't run this code, PHP doesn't work in JSFiddle. Can we see console output?
[02:29:31] <kennett85> shoky: How do I add commas?
[02:29:52] <Lost123> jonno11: i am just trying to run the slideshow part, the first function i mean
[02:30:15] <Lost123> php will be run after i know how to call a function onPause of slideshow
[02:30:18] <jonno11> Lost123: have you got console output?
[02:30:32] <Lost123> from ajax request?
[02:30:50] <jonno11> from your browser…
[02:30:52] <shoky> kennett85:  123 + ',' + 456 + ',' + 789
[02:31:07] <Lost123> my ajax was working fine, when i associated with click event, the output was fine
[02:31:30] <Lost123> now i want to associate with slideshow pause
[02:31:39] <rabbi1> shoky: i have already used it
[02:31:44] <Lost123> and i am not sure how to do it
[02:31:50] <shoky> rabbi1: not in your fiddle
[02:32:29] <rabbi1> shoky: oops, sorry . i was checking the last line of js in there
[02:32:30] <jonno11> Lost123: open your page in a browser and open the console. http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers
[02:33:01] <Lost123> jonno11: my php and ajax are fine
[02:33:09] <Lost123> i dont need to see the console output
[02:33:27] <rabbi1> shoky: then that a.tab-2 isn't required ? there is lot to it, cos any field in any tab may be required....
[02:33:27] <Lost123> the only problem is, how do i call a function when slideshow pauses
[02:33:32] <jonno11> Yes, yes you do. You need to see why the JS is throwing an error.
[02:33:43] <Lost123> oh ok
[02:33:59] <shoky> rabbi1: if you want to prevent tabs from being changed, use the select event
[02:34:18] <shoky> rabbi1: that a.tab click handler was being called AFTER the tabs had already changed..
[02:34:41] <shoky> and the validation plugin doesnt validate hidden fields
[02:36:18] <rabbi1> shoky: okies, there is bit more to it, will make those updates now and see.... :)
[02:39:11] <rabbi1> shoky: now, if u can have a look here ... http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/62/
[02:40:09] <rabbi1> the tab-2 has a required field and i am able to navigate to tab-3 , the validitity happens only if the particular tab is selected or unselected....
[02:42:14] <rabbi1> shoky: the submit button is on the last tab always, just like a breadcrumb navigation. if a user fills elements in tab-1 then only he should be allowed to next tab, which in this case is happening to tab-2, but there is another element in tab-2 which is required, but i am able to go to tab-3 with out filling he element in tab-2... how to avoid this?
[02:46:27] <lost123> jonno11: you there?
[02:46:34] <jonno11> yep
[02:47:51] <lost123`> ah
[02:48:04] <lost123`> jonno11: i get this error in console Uncaught TypeError: Object #<r> has no method 'bind'
[02:48:35] <lost123`> when uncommenting the code in http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/31/
[02:48:37] <kennett85> shoky: Like this http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/gBDrq/1/
[02:48:41] <shoky> lost123`: its fine when you use normal jquery and normal jq tools
[02:48:55] <shoky> lost123`: http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/34/
[02:49:39] <lost123`> shoky:  wow..what did you change?
[02:50:17] <shoky> lost123`: just the included files..
[02:51:06] <shoky> lost123`: donno what that slider.js you included is.. i just included jq tools
[02:51:14] <shoky> (without jquery included inside)
[02:51:20] <shoky> your slider.js had jquery inside it
[02:51:31] <rabbi1> shoky: u there? it's only checking for valid if that tab is selected. else it's not. http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/63/
[02:52:10] <lost123`> you removed the slider.js ?
[02:52:17] <lost123`> and added jq tools?
[02:52:55] <shoky> lost123`: yes
[02:53:04] <shoky> jq tools without jquery inside
[02:53:59] <shoky> rabbi1: as i said, it currently ignores hidden fields
[02:54:53] <rabbi1> shoky: any work arounds ?
[02:55:09] <shoky> rabbi1:  yea put the ignore option, equal to  []
[02:55:37] <shoky> hah but then it wont let you move tabs ;p
[02:55:42] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/TTTLw/65/
[02:55:44] <rabbi1> shoky: under valid function in validate.js ?
[02:55:52] <shoky> validate function
[02:58:14] <rabbi1> shoky: before i was trying something like getting the current tabs and then redirecting to previous tab on false ....
[02:59:26] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, too many dependencies..... :(
[03:00:30] <rabbi1> shoky: ignore: [] will not help
[03:00:39] <shoky> rabbi1:  http://jsfiddle.net/TTTLw/66/
[03:00:51] <shoky> i made it only put ignore: []  if you're in the last tab..
[03:02:05] <shoky> hm
[03:02:17] <shoky> didnt help actually
[03:02:19] <rabbi1> shoky: nope, that's again the same, the last tab ignores other to filed validations
[03:06:00] <rabbi1> shoky: i am not sure, how ignore helps .....
[03:06:54] <rabbi1> ignore eliminates the checking of that lasttab, but lasttab number is not sure as the number is dynamic and that last tab may also have a required field.....
[03:11:11] <lost123`> shoky:
[03:11:30] <lost123`> how can i attach the slide toggle event to the last slide display
[03:11:44] <lost123`> its now associated with tabIndex
[03:12:09] <lost123`> http://jsfiddle.net/dEjMA/34/
[03:14:18] <shoky> dunno jqtools, sry
[03:16:32] <shoky> rabbi1: sry donno the validation plugin too well
[03:18:19] <shoky> kennett85:
[03:18:29] <shoky> ?js (1234543534).toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",");
[03:18:31] <bot-t> shoky: "1,234,543,534"
[03:18:41] <rabbi1> shoky: seems very complex ... to me
[03:18:42] <kennett85> shoky: Ya
[03:20:18] <lost123`> jquery is an api to access javascript right..or we can say its a library based on js
[03:20:20] <lost123`> right?
[03:20:45] <lost123`> and jquery tools is an api to access jquery?
[03:21:01] <lost123`> i am a bit confused about so many jquery apis
[03:23:34] <kennett85> shoky: I'm sorry but not sure what to do w/ that.
[03:23:54] <anew_> if you know what events are being fired over a specific div.... how can you figure out what functions that were written are being used?  it's so hard to debug someone elses jq...
[03:25:39] <kennett85> shoky: I'm brand new to js and my brain is foggy right now.
[03:28:48] <kennett85> shoky: Is this correct?  http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/W5jwY/148/
[03:30:09] <tman> how do you reliably get the width of the client scroll bar?
[03:30:24] <tman> $('body').innerWidth(); ?
[03:31:39] <tman> isn't that the same as window.width() ?
[03:32:34] <kennett85> shoky: Sorry I meant to post this.  http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/gBDrq/2/
[03:33:37] <kennett85> shoky: I can get it to load the Subtotal at the bottom w/ comma but not after I click a checkbox.
[03:34:20] <AcademyIntl> I'm having a really cripling and unique issue with append, when I do innerContainer.append(data); data is DUPLICATED inside the container, but when I do innerContainer.html(innerContainer.html()) this does not happen.   Anyone know what's up?
[03:36:01] <AcademyIntl> Relavant pastie: http://pastie.org/private/numxigxhozytr2pdcyrzmw
[03:38:19] <javalover> k so this is a bit of a goofy question but I have like 5 links
[03:38:49] <AcademyIntl> Also:  Is there a way to pre-pend with jQuery or javascript besides the current method I am imposing of innerContent.html(data + innerContent.html());  My existing method causes content flicker on some IE and mobile devices while the new html is parsed.
[03:39:05] <javalover> and I want to make it so whichever is highlighted is like idk raised up a bit & a new color]
[03:39:18] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Easy:  Moment while I make an example for you.
[03:39:31] <javalover> I know it's a noob question just I want to know the best way to do it
[03:39:43] <javalover> is there a way I can make it like no matter how many links I add, it all follows suit?
[03:40:25] <bloof> .aids:hover {color:light urple}
[03:42:13] <AcademyIntl> javalover: http://jsfiddle.net/9Pxqm/
[03:42:57] <AcademyIntl> bloof: I'm guessing he wants to do more than just CSS to it (hence asking in jQuery).
[03:43:37] <javalover> academy that's awesome for one link
[03:43:41] <AcademyIntl> Italian_Plumber: Is your name Mario perchance  ?  </badjokes>
[03:43:42] <javalover> but i'm asking say I add multiple links
[03:43:48] <AcademyIntl> javalover: This works for every link with class "special"
[03:43:48] <javalover> what is best approach to make all follow suit?
[03:43:55] <javalover> ok so best way is to assign the class?
[03:44:15] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Yes, there are other ways but class is the easiest selector for multiple elements.
[03:44:22] <bloof> that is pretty much just css though
[03:44:35] <javalover> and then I guess if I were to make multiple links I would loop through & assign a class to each one correct?
[03:44:47] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Example:  $('a') will select all links.  $('a.special') will select links with class special... etc.
[03:44:59] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Is jQuery / js creating the links?
[03:45:20] <javalover> right now i'm doing a newHtml = newHtml + "<a href>" type
[03:45:27] <javalover> and then i asign the html to the variable newhtml
[03:45:37] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Yeah, there's an easier way... moment.
[03:46:19] <bloof> http://jsfiddle.net/V64Ya/1/
[03:46:33] <bloof> :(
[03:47:01] <javalover> bloof did you even change anything?
[03:47:31] <javalover> oh i c
[03:47:33] <javalover> less code?
[03:48:02] <javalover> in fact urs has no jquery at all haha
[03:48:21] <javalover> why the long face?
[03:49:35] <AcademyIntl> javalover: http://jsfiddle.net/9Pxqm/1/
[03:50:42] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Bloof's code is great if all you want to do is apply some effects to text when it is hovered, mine allows you to do other things (javascript wise) on hover.  You can choose whichever method suits your needs in that case, however my new post shows how to programatically create links more efficiently than your appending method.
[03:51:35] <javalover> is your way faster?
[03:52:13] <javalover> i want the one that is fastest
[03:52:20] <bloof> if you just want a hover effect CSS only is fine
[03:52:32] <javalover> not worired bout that
[03:52:40] <javalover> worried about assigning like   mything.html('' + newhtml);
[03:52:44] <javalover> vs Acadmy's method
[03:52:46] <AcademyIntl> javalover: If you are creating MANY links: this may be easier:http://jsfiddle.net/9Pxqm/2/
[03:53:24] <javalover> that's sick
[03:53:34] <AcademyIntl> javalover: I figured you'd like it :).
[03:53:35] <javalover> umm, but which is faster?
[03:53:38] <javalover> prewritten code, or code like yours?
[03:53:50] <javalover> it's probably faster to call the page your way huh?
[03:53:51] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Fastest way:  Have the actual links in the page, don't use javascript at all.
[03:53:58] <javalover> are you sure though?
[03:54:00] <javalover> think about it
[03:54:02] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Second fastest:  Create them my way.
[03:54:09] <javalover> a page grows in size based on how much you add to it
[03:54:16] <javalover> but a javascript page is created on load
[03:54:16] <kennett85> Does my code look correct?  http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/gBDrq/4/
[03:54:28] <AcademyIntl> javalover: The javascript is still transfered with the page.
[03:54:34] <javalover> orly?
[03:54:38] <javalover> wait but
[03:54:41] <javalover> ugh confused
[03:54:53] <javalover> say I load a page that is only 2k in size
[03:54:56] <javalover> vs 8k in size
[03:55:10] <javalover> the 2k creates an 8k page
[03:55:15] <javalover> does it take same amount of time to load?
[03:55:19] <javalover> or which one is faster
[03:55:22] <AcademyIntl> javalover: I see what you're saying.  Does this page have thousands of links?
[03:55:23] <javalover> as the 8k just has pure html
[03:55:28] <javalover> well no...
[03:55:32] <javalover> but it could
[03:55:36] <javalover> depends on what users add to the site
[03:55:42] <javalover> it's like a youtube
[03:55:56] <AcademyIntl> javalover: This is what pagination is for :).  That's another topic however.  Or AJAX for that matter.
[03:56:11] <javalover> ohy well just speaking in general
[03:56:16] <javalover> which method is faster
[03:56:20] <bloof> kennett85: you need to be more specific
[03:56:26] <AcademyIntl> javalover: For the sake of answering your question however, my method will produce the smallest / fastest combination means of accomplishing your goal, given your data is small.
[03:56:52] <javalover> hmmm i'll keep that in mind
[03:57:09] <javalover> for now i've made the site using my method so imma finish it this way then i'm gonna go over it & implement your method
[03:57:22] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Nowadays, the difference of 6KB is <1 second on almost any internet connection, even mobiles.
[03:57:23] <javalover> I think creating the code at runtime is probably faster
[03:57:34] <javalover> sure but I still kinda like your method
[03:57:38] <javalover> however
[03:57:41] <javalover> mine is more readable
[03:57:45] <AcademyIntl> javalover: My method is creating the links on runtime, lol.
[03:57:47] <javalover> so I can make changes easier
[03:57:47] <javalover> least from what I can tell
[03:58:01] <javalover> I think if I control that
[03:58:01] <AcademyIntl> javalover: And what's not readable about makeLink('name', 'url'); ?  :P
[03:58:02] <javalover> it can be better
[03:58:10] <javalover> it's not that it's just
[03:58:15] <javalover> i have a lot of sections on this site
[03:58:19] <javalover> so once I see how it works then I conver it
[03:58:26] <javalover> I think my method is slow because of this
[03:58:31] <javalover> I have like all these pages inside 1 page
[03:58:43] <javalover> so you have to load everything all at once
[03:58:50] <javalover> but your method I can do like
[03:58:50] <javalover> "k load vidoes"
[03:58:57] <javalover> "k reload homepage"
[03:59:01] <javalover> or even store homepage in memory
[03:59:03] <javalover> then repull it
[03:59:07] <AcademyIntl> javalover: Your method is the same.
[03:59:13] <javalover> instead of "well we're not using videos so still load it"
[03:59:16] <javalover> it's not though when you think about it
[03:59:25] <AcademyIntl> javalover: You're getting confused I bet.
[03:59:30] <javalover> are you sure cuz look
[03:59:35] <javalover> I have like newhtml = newhtml +
[03:59:45] <javalover> "< a href">;
[03:59:53] <javalover> i can't type this out but the point is
[04:00:00] <javalover> I have lines & lines of txt for that
[04:00:15] <javalover> but with your code it would just be like  createLink();
[04:00:27] <javalover> which is clearly less text
[04:00:30] <AcademyIntl> javalover: No, you've got it confused :)
[04:00:47] <javalover> at runtime does it come out to same amount?
[04:00:55] <AcademyIntl> Mine would take your code:  newHtml = newHtml + "<a href='http://www.google.com'>Google</a>";  and convert it into newHtml = makeLink('Google', 'http://www.google.com/');
[04:01:06] <javalover> yeah that's what i'm saying
[04:01:10] <javalover> isn't that smaller & hence faster?
[04:01:41] <AcademyIntl> Yeah, mine is smaller; and faster (as the objects are generated in the DOM and rendered as they are created, and not in one lump sum as yours would be whenever you paste the newHtml into the page.)
[04:01:41] <kennett85> bloof: What I'm wanting to do is add thousands separator to the subtotal, change the subtotal by checking/unchecking boxes the div not the box and adding thousands separator to the updated subtotal.
[04:01:54] <javalover> ok well then good
[04:01:59] <javalover> imma do your method when i'm done
[04:02:07] <javalover> just go over each section & remake it speed up the site
[04:02:37] <javalover> and I might even block stuff out where I don't even have the javascript till I Load it in
[04:02:41] <javalover> I can do this right?
[04:02:48] <javalover> like...make a different page that I load from?
[04:03:53] <javalover> I might sound like a noob but the truth is i'm just asking questions to be precise about what i'm doing, i'm really a beast of a coder
[04:04:05] <javalover> I just like to be thorough when I do stuff is all.
[04:06:56] <wiehan> Hi, I am playing around with jquery, and still in the rough stages of coding. I have this xml file http://pastebin.com/5Veq52qh and using this code: http://pastebin.com/52n3AFNC - The first block of code delivers nothing, i.e. not working, the second dose work, well...
[04:07:07] <wiehan> I don't understand what is going on
[04:10:44] <javalover> wiehan is it too much trouble to ask for a fiddle?
[04:10:55] <javalover> cuz imma look at it but a fiddle would be nice anyways i look at this
[04:11:19] <wiehan> javalover: what is a fiddle?
[04:11:26] <javalover> oh wow i can't read that
[04:11:33] <javalover> but i link you to a fiddle so you can see how they work
[04:11:42] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/9Pxqm/
[04:11:53] <javalover> they're pretty cool I hated them when I first saw them but
[04:11:58] <javalover> they've grown on me.
[04:12:09] <javalover> can be hard to set one up sometimes but they are useful for small stuff
[04:12:57] <javalover> i can't really read ur code though kinda confusing
[04:13:03] <wiehan> javalover: I'll have to figure that fiddle stuff out - looks complicated
[04:13:46] <javalover> yeah i'm still a bit confused on it
[04:13:49] <javalover> ok so here's the thing
[04:13:57] <javalover> you have an alert inside a loop
[04:14:08] <javalover> try console.log("stuff"); instead
[04:14:12] <javalover> and use firebug to read it
[04:14:18] <javalover> ever done that b4?
[04:14:46] <wiehan> javalover: Ok, I understand.. will "fiddle" with that
[04:15:04] <javalover> i mean you don't have to fiddle it
[04:15:13] <javalover> as i see ur using xml but I was just saying for future stuff
[04:15:26] <javalover> but sure if you can fiddle it, I bet we both can solve this
[04:15:32] <javalover> or a vet can help..hopefully a vet
[04:17:05] <wiehan> javalover: a "vet", cause these puppies are "sick"
[04:41:27] <javalover> lol
[05:16:04] <Blaster> hey guys, can anyone help me figure out why this simple jQuery won't toggle back and forth between states?  http://jsfiddle.net/euTWx/

[05:54:39] <mrittman> hey guys I have a horizontal menu that I want to slide out when my mouse is over the logo on my site. Anyone know the best way to go about this?
[05:56:40] <mrittman> This is what I have so far but it's pretty messed up :(
[05:56:41] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[06:01:40] <oal> I need some kind of numeric widget that I can control with a mouse, and works for small numbers (1-10) and huge numbers (10000-100000). I was thinking something like this: |____|^v| (an input and arrow up/down, but can't remember what it's called)
[06:01:51] <SonicX> is there any function in jquery to find no of siblings for a element ?
[06:02:06] <oal> .children().length
[06:02:36] <oal> SonicX: ^ will work, I think
[06:03:22] <SonicX> but doesnt this count child's children as well ?
[06:03:48] <oal> Let me jsfiddle it
[06:06:27] <oal> SonicX: nope, http://jsfiddle.net/astNa/
[06:06:36] <oal> Only first level of children
[06:08:42] <oal> whoops, forgot a / at the end. This is better, SonicX: http://jsfiddle.net/astNa/1/
[06:11:11] <SonicX> oal: thanks ! that helps :)
[06:13:04] <rabbi1> how can i ignore the selected tab ? http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/70/
[06:13:48] <oal> rabbi1: what do you mean by ignore?
[06:15:18] <mrittman> Can someone help me with my custom slide out menu on my site?
[06:15:19] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[06:15:41] <mrittman> I need it to stay open when the mouse hovers over the actual menu
[06:17:12] <oal> malifae: you want to have it stay open when hovering over the logo?
[06:17:30] <rabbi1> oal: i am trying to validate fields in each tab and if it's valid the user can navigate to other .... how can i achieve this ?
[06:18:07] <mrittman> oal, yes
[06:21:23] <oal> miceiken: maybe something like $("#logo").mouseout
[06:22:08] <oal> rabbi1: what exactly isn't working now?
[06:24:56] <rabbi1> oal: even though it is valid, unable to navigate to next tab. its returning false
[06:26:53] <rabbi1> oal: if i remove that "ignore: "" " from inside the .validate() function. it validates only for selected tab, as the valid event is triggered only on select: event
[06:28:13] <oal> rabbi1: not familiar with jquery.validate. :/
[06:29:00] <rabbi1> oal: that's ok,
[06:40:52] <rabbi11> how to get the value of the UI tab clicked ? not selected ...
[06:56:52] <wiehan> jQuery xml - I need help. I have this XML file http://goo.gl/9WFLE (Very neat when opened with chrome/firefox). I want to use jquery to assign all the values contained therein into a multi dimensional array in javascript, now, the last part is sort of trivial. I have tried dozens of methods but I just can't "recursively" get jquery +- a for loop to go through that xml file so that I can save the data for each letter as the following: alphabet [i][j] = xml.
[06:56:52] <wiehan> root.child (pseudo code)
[06:59:21] <miceiken> okay, so I am using replaceWith to make a new html element, but it seems to me like jQuery doesnt recognize it as an element
[07:00:50] <wiehan> will paypal 1 euro for the solution, lol
[07:04:22] <bindi> how can I get how many elements I have inside some other element?
[07:04:51] <bindi> ah, #some_element > div
[07:06:18] <wiehan> jquery and xml is hell
[07:11:50] * miceiken slaps bindi around a bit with a large trout
[07:12:03] <miceiken> fkn rtard
[07:26:49] <rabbi1> how to get class name or id name from ui.index number to a variable ?
[07:29:33] <mrittman> Anyone know how I would get the menu to stay open when your mouse is over the logo on my site?
[07:29:34] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[07:29:51] <mrittman> when you try to click the links, the menu folds in
[07:31:13] <mc_teo> Hello, I remember a jquery plugin that would base a sort of content frame with dynamic height, by making an array of divs with background images, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. Anyone have any idea?
[07:31:47] <bindi> I have something like [{"id":"0","comment":"moo"},{"id":"1","comment":"foo"}] - how do I iterate over this?
[07:32:12] <johnkpaul> ?each @bindi
[07:32:13] <bot-t> bindi, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[07:32:22] <johnkpaul> rabbi1: I don't understand your question
[07:32:22] <bindi> already tried $.each(data, ... but it iterates character by character
[07:32:32] <johnkpaul> bindi: then data is a string
[07:32:35] <johnkpaul> ?parseJSON @bindi
[07:32:35] <bot-t> bindi, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[07:32:58] <bindi> johnkpaul: I tried adding parsed = $.parseJSON(data); and $.each(parsed, ... but it errors for some reason.. "unexpected token {"
[07:33:01] <bindi> I'll show it to you
[07:33:18] <bindi> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/
[07:33:49] <rabbi1> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/76/
[07:34:41] <johnkpaul> bindi: the response from load.php is not valid json
[07:34:47] <johnkpaul> it is actually a syntax error
[07:34:57] <johnkpaul> take a look at it in chrome/firefox web dev tools net panel
[07:35:05] <bindi> it's not valid? huh
[07:35:06] <bindi> sec
[07:35:32] <bindi> ahha
[07:35:35] <bindi> forgot that one
[07:35:36] <rabbi1> johnkpaul: got 4 tabs, first tab should be ignored by validation - working. the user should be allowed to navigate to 3rd, 4th or further tabs only if valid is true on the previous tabs(except) first tab..... which is not happening..... its not validating for a tab which is not 'selected' (hidden)
[07:36:14] <bindi> johnkpaul: okay, now it's giving me object objects, how do I progress from here
[07:36:42] <johnkpaul> bindi: try undoing your parseJSON, it's probably being interpeted as json already now
[07:36:51] <johnkpaul> just $.each(data...
[07:37:10] <bindi> johnkpaul: nope, now it's char by char :p
[07:37:12] <johnkpaul> rabbi1: which part of your code is not working?
[07:38:17] <johnkpaul> bindi: oh I see, just debugged
[07:38:26] <johnkpaul> have you used the chrome/firefox js debugger before?
[07:38:31] <johnkpaul> you should look into it
[07:38:42] <bindi> yes, but my debugging skills with js aren't that great yet
[07:38:47] <johnkpaul> key and value, are being set correctly, key becomes the integer indexes and value is the object at that index
[07:38:54] <johnkpaul> you're alerting it, which calls .toString()
[07:39:01] <rabbi1> johnkpaul: which part ?
[07:39:01] <johnkpaul> so [Object object] is correct
[07:39:15] <johnkpaul> rabbi1: yes, I don't understand wht the question is
[07:39:28] <johnkpaul> rabbi1: you're telling me your requirements, not the question you have about jquery or your code
[07:40:08] <rabbi1> johnkpaul: i need to validate even the hidden tab (unselected)
[07:40:57] <bindi> johnkpaul: how do I use key and value then? I tried parsed.key but I don't think that's how I'm supposed to do it
[07:41:09] <mrittman> anyone?
[07:41:10] <bindi> hm
[07:41:14] <johnkpaul> bindi, what do you need to do with it?
[07:41:20] <johnkpaul> for what purpose are you iterating over the objects?
[07:41:28] <bindi> johnkpaul: adding it to the div
[07:41:37] <bindi> saw the commented line? :p
[07:42:01] <johnkpaul> but that commented line isn't in your loop
[07:42:08] <bindi> yes it isn't
[07:42:11] <johnkpaul> you're looking up on parsed rather than value
[07:42:13] <bindi> it's a leftover from before I had it
[07:42:20] <bindi> i have something else inside the loop now
[07:42:20] <johnkpaul> so parsed is an array of objects
[07:43:14] <bindi> got it now!
[07:43:23] <johnkpaul> great
[07:43:45] <johnkpaul> mrittman: if you can show me the code that you're talking about, maybe I can help
[07:44:04] <rabbi1> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/78/
[07:44:06] <johnkpaul> but just saying "here's the site, x doesn't work" isn't really helpful
[07:44:17] <mrittman> sure man let me post it
[07:44:48] <Whirl3d_> Good mornin all. How do I test if the value passed in a parameter _is_ another jquery object? In other words: showItem(item) {if (item.is(this.currentItem)) {do stuff     seems dangerous..
[07:45:08] <yaazkal> Hello. This is hard to explain to me but I'll try. I have version 1 of one page that I made: Using zoomy plugin I "capture" the click and identify if the user has clicked some character on a photo, then change the photo for other... it was working well. Now I have version 2 of the same, but now I'm using transition between "slides" with jmpress plugin. I found that the click event is not triggered on my photos or links and even the div than contain the pho
[07:45:09] <yaazkal> to. You can see version 1 on www.alasdemariposa.com/test/w and version 2 on www.alasdemariposa.com/test/e   any idea why I can't catch the click event on version 2 ?
[07:46:01] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: I believe that the typical method is to check for the property jquery
[07:46:16] <johnkpaul> if( 'jquery' in obj){// obj is a jquery object}
[07:46:21] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().jquery
[07:46:32] <bot-t> johnkpaul: No output. (Process Killed)
[07:46:32] <Whirl3d_> johnkpaul, but I need to know if item===item2....
[07:46:46] <mrittman> johnkpaul, here's the code
[07:46:47] <mrittman> http://pastebin.com/APvfRrHL
[07:47:30] <Whirl3d_> and in jquery, it seems dangerous because $(item) might be different from $(someotheritem) though they point to the same element...maybe?
[07:47:34] <johnkpaul> oh, Whirl3d_, .is is appropraite for that
[07:47:47] <johnkpaul> well, it depends on what "different means"
[07:47:58] <johnkpaul> .is() checks if there are elements that exist in both
[07:48:35] <johnkpaul> mrittman: ths most obvious way to fix this is just to add a timeout to the animation
[07:48:40] <johnkpaul> so you have a second to click
[07:49:21] <Whirl3d_> so, var item=$(selector).clone().is($(selecctor)) will return false ? maybe? I'll tias.
[07:49:27] <mrittman> add like a 5 second timeout?
[07:49:42] <sahbeewah> what
[07:49:45] <sahbeewah> no
[07:49:47] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: i am tired since 7 hrs .. :(
[07:49:52] <johnkpaul> mrittman: 5 seconds seems a bit longer
[07:50:02] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: no, that's not going to happen
[07:50:11] <mrittman> 2 or 3 seconds maybe
[07:50:11] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, I thought you were squared away, what's up?
[07:50:15] <johnkpaul> but $('.sel1, .sel2').is('.sel1') would be true
[07:50:20] <johnkpaul> even though they don't _completely_ match
[07:50:33] <sahbeewah> mrittman: move your mouseover handler to a common parent element of both the link and the menu items
[07:50:54] <mrittman> what's the best way to add a timeout to my code?
[07:50:59] <johnkpaul> yeah, sahbeewah has a better idea, but requires more code change
[07:51:00] <sahbeewah> so it'll still be over it when you move it over the menu
[07:52:00] <Whirl3d_> In your experience, is it better to keep a logical value for "current" item in something like a gallery...or do you rely on the dom to maintain state by adding classes to elements or selecting based on visibility etc?
[07:52:19] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: keeping it in memory is better
[07:52:25] <johnkpaul> no need to lookup and rely on the DOM
[07:52:34] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Getting-Truth-Out-of-the-DOM
[07:52:53] <johnkpaul> I'd like to think that I knew to do that before wycats presentation, but he puts it really nicely :)
[07:53:11] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: tired to achieve this... http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/79/
[07:53:26] <Whirl3d_> how you are always able to have just the right video for every situation--it astounds me. Thanks. watching now.
[07:53:57] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: haha, I read and watch a lot
[07:54:14] <rabbi1> i need a nice bumps, my cerebrum is dead
[07:54:30] <mrittman> I'm a little confused...
[07:54:54] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, what are you trying to accomplish? prohibit the user from seeing tab 2 until tab1 is validated?
[07:54:55] <wiehan> I got it!
[07:55:10] <johnkpaul> mrittman: sahbeewah is telling you to change a.phillips to #logo
[07:55:27] <johnkpaul> and I was telling you to add setTimeout(function(){//animate}, 2000) to your code
[07:55:40] <johnkpaul> make sahbeewah's change though, it's a better idea
[07:56:00] <Whirl3d_> just an idea, you might consider adding a cllass to invalid or "uninitiated" tabs to indicate such. like ".init" to each tab with background-color:grey and then when they get to that tab, remove the init class..
[07:56:11] <mrittman> I did that and now it's doing something funky...
[07:56:20] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[07:56:37] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: not from seeing, from accessing.... and tab-1 should be ignored.... the validation should happen from tab 2
[07:56:40] <johnkpaul> oh I see, logo isn't the whole row, mrittman
[07:56:41] <tomasm-> hi, if I create an event callback, ie bind('reload'), do I need to call each(), or is that implicit for each item?
[07:56:41] <tomasm-> if there's more than one
[07:56:42] <johnkpaul> change it to #heaer
[07:57:19] <johnkpaul> #header* @ mrittman
[07:57:27] <Whirl3d_> well, first of all you don't have any forms to validate yet, am I right?
[07:57:29] <mrittman> same thing :(
[07:57:36] <mrittman> keeps giong in and out
[07:58:37] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: no input fields in tab-1, but are there in other tabs
[07:59:35] <johnkpaul> mrittman: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1805-jQuery-Events-MouseOver-MouseOut-vs-MouseEnter-MouseLeave.htm
[07:59:49] <Whirl3d_> Here's what I think you should consider..
[08:00:01] <rabbi1> please
[08:00:03] <Whirl3d_> don't validate the forms in your tab select handler
[08:00:23] <mrittman> thanks man
[08:00:25] <Whirl3d_> only validate the forms when A) they lose focus or b) they are submitted
[08:00:44] <Whirl3d_> then in your validation, add a class to the tab indicating the the tab is valid
[08:00:57] <johnkpaul> mrittman: no problem, have fun!
[08:01:05] <mrittman> haha yep…sure will
[08:01:15] <Whirl3d_> so in your select method (which will fire after you lose focus and therefor validate), just check if the tab is valid before continuing.
[08:01:21] <Whirl3d_> Tab 1 is always valid
[08:01:41] <johnkpaul> mrittman: there'll always be help around here
[08:01:51] <mrittman> thanks, I appreciate it
[08:03:10] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: from the documentation, it says ignore with "element" id should ignore, but it's not... :(
[08:03:29] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: in this http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/80/  i have added ignore: "#tab-1"
[08:03:30] <Whirl3d_> that's in the form validation
[08:03:40] <Whirl3d_> you don't have a form on tab 1
[08:03:54] <Whirl3d_> separate your form validation from your tab navigation
[08:04:03] <Whirl3d_> they are two separate (though related) issues.
[08:05:18] <Whirl3d_> oh and furthermore, you select all the forms with $('form') so even the invisible forms are forced to validate before continuing
[08:05:20] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: that's done, now if i remove ignore: from the validate function, everythings ok, except. it doesn't validate for a tab which is not selected .
[08:06:09] <rabbi1> u can have a look at this behaviour here http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/80/
[08:06:19] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/81 sorry this one
[08:07:07] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: yeah, but. it won't validate if the input class is not "required" ..... will just ignore it
[08:08:19] <rabbi1> in link 81, we can have perfect validation, except that it doesn't validate until the tab is selected. so i may have to take out the validation code from the " select: " event..... shouldn't i ?

[08:12:40] <Whirl3d_> this is just a start...
[08:14:44] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: a start? started every hour with each documents ,,, :) thank you. having a look at it
[08:16:09] <Whirl3d_> notice because I manually added "valid" to tab 1, you can go to tab 2
[08:16:39] <Whirl3d_> Now I am separating the form on tab 2 to be it's own form... which will validate and either make tab 2 valid or not
[08:17:56] <rabbi1> but now in the console, i get always false,
[08:19:09] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: separating the form ? that may create a problem in future ..... not sure about that ...
[08:24:21] <anew_> anyone have a faster way of finding functions in jq than setting up event listener breakpoints and stepping thru the code?  takes forever.............
[08:25:42] <Whirl3d_> I don't know how the form validator you are using works...reading up on it now
[08:27:28] <arnoud> Hi I am want to build an jquery slideshow with buttons to move to the next and previous slide my example = http://www.android.com/about/ (bottom  of the page). Anybody an suggestion for an jquery lib to use? I am thinking about the jquery cycle lib maybe something similiar can be done easier.. Like to know suggestions
[08:28:23] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_:  okay ....
[08:28:43] <rabbi1> i just applied the form validate method to it..
[08:32:01] <anew_> anyone have a faster way of finding functions in jq than setting up event listener breakpoints and stepping thru the code?  takes forever
[08:34:16] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, with one form, no moving forward until the tab is valid: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TTTLw/96/
[08:35:25] <Whirl3d_> there is still some optimization that could be done, but you should be able to see clearly how we did it.
[08:35:55] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: yeah, having a look at it....
[08:36:06] <rabbi1> this seems more complex than i predicted. ...
[08:36:25] <Whirl3d_> really, it's not...
[08:36:58] <Whirl3d_> I made a simple function that checks all of the input elements in the tab. If they are all valid, the tab is valid if not, the tab is not.
[08:37:25] <Whirl3d_> then when you click on a tab, it checks all the previous tabs to be sure they are valid. If not, no activating the tab
[08:37:49] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: the line used from var validateTab ..... till return, was able to do it while adding a validate function. until here is okay, the further one is what i was out of mind....
[08:38:35] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: yeah? but i am unable to select the third tab, even it is valid .....
[08:39:06] <Whirl3d_> because the 2nd tab has to be valid
[08:39:31] <Whirl3d_> fill out the 2nd tab and then you can reach the third tab
[08:39:40] <rabbi1> console says tab-1 is valid which is correct, and then tab-2 is not which is also correct, but how can i make it valid without accessing it ... ?
[08:40:00] <Whirl3d_> why would you want to?
[08:40:09] <Whirl3d_> Isn't that the point of this entire excercise?
[08:40:24] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: oops, sorry.... i had given it only for one tab, so was trying it with one tab only
[08:41:00] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: it is, sorry. my mistake, i din't realize that you have put validation for all input fields .....
[08:41:15] <Whirl3d_> that happens when you validate
[08:41:20] <Whirl3d_> automatically
[08:41:26] <Whirl3d_> unless you ignore them
[08:41:57] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: correct :)
[08:42:06] <rabbi1> a sign of releaf at last ...
[08:43:47] <rabbi1> and instead of var inputs=tab.find("input"); i can replease it with var inputs=tab.find('input[class="required"]'); so that it can only check the required once... am i right with the attr syntax here ?
[08:43:53] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: ^
[08:44:26] <Whirl3d_> I am not sure about class='required'
[08:44:30] <Whirl3d_> lemme check.
[08:44:53] <Whirl3d_> no. just do this: $(".required")
[08:45:06] <Whirl3d_> instead of "input"
[08:45:45] <rabbi1> var inputs=tab.find($(".required"); something wrong here ...?
[08:46:46] <Whirl3d_> lemme check the dom. Validate might remove the required tag in favor of the required attribute.
[08:46:50] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: that has to be only inputs, i think this code will select all elements with class name required ... isn't it
[08:48:03] <Whirl3d_> sure, but you don't have .required on anything but inputs do you?
[08:50:05] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TTTLw/99/
[08:50:08] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: this actually works var inputs=tab.find('input[class="required"]');
[08:50:19] <Whirl3d_> ta da! in just under 100 attempts
[08:50:30] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: nope, i do have on label tag as well
[08:50:56] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: oops, 100s ... great. have you ever reached it? i haven't at all :)
[08:51:44] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, cool. the problem with input[class='require'] is that it shouldnt grab the inputs with ".require" AND ".valid" because you are specifying the class attrbute=="required"  not has class (required)
[08:52:13] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: can u try this ? on no. 99 ... come back to any tab and remove the input field and try to navigate to other
[08:53:09] <Whirl3d_> grr. you need to remove the valid class from the input inside your validation routine.
[08:54:25] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: even that is done automatically, but no idea why its not behaving as intended ... :)
[08:54:46] <rabbi1> it says "field is required"  and still we can navigate .... looks like 100 is not the number .... :)
[08:55:07] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TTTLw/100/
[08:55:19] <Whirl3d_> or we can shoot for 200. LOL
[08:55:25] <rabbi1> lol
[08:56:36] <rabbi1> :(
[08:57:07] <rabbi1> tab.removeClass('valid'); has no effect ?
[08:58:59] <rabbi1> on the cccc
[09:01:06] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: sometimes, it just not say error "field is required"  why this behaviour could be ?
[09:01:43] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: some times you just try to remove the input content, it doesn't change from valid to error. ....... :(
[09:04:36] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: thanks a lot, have a nice day.....
[09:15:13] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, havn't left yet.. Just playin around with something.
[09:15:30] <johnkpaul> :)
[09:16:00] <mrittman> hey johnpaul, I have a delay set up on my slide out menu
[09:16:04] <mrittman> johnkpaul
[09:16:28] <mrittman> http://pastebin.com/fUDsfvS2
[09:16:58] <johnkpaul> mrittman: I don't think you understand how delay works
[09:17:00] <johnkpaul> ?delay @ mrittman
[09:17:00] <bot-t> mrittman, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[09:17:10] <johnkpaul> it only affects what comes after it
[09:17:12] <mrittman> it works fine but the problem I've having is that if you move your mouse over it like 10 times, it will trigger it 10 times every 3.5 seconds
[09:17:19] <johnkpaul> ?stop @mrittman
[09:17:21] <bot-t> mrittman, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[09:17:41] <johnkpaul> .stop().animate(()
[09:18:04] <mrittman> just add stop to it?
[09:19:02] <johnkpaul> ?tias @mrittman
[09:19:03] <bot-t> mrittman, Try It And See
[09:19:14] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/S8TS2/ Anyone know how to save the order of connected sortable lists to mysql?
[09:19:47] <mrittman> johnkpaul, that causes more problems...
[09:20:59] <johnkpaul> mrittman: I can't get to the site at the moment
[09:21:17] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[09:21:24] <johnkpaul> I know
[09:21:29] <mrittman> oh
[09:21:30] <johnkpaul> just hanging
[09:21:38] <johnkpaul> it was still in my tab list
[09:21:48] <johnkpaul> "this webpage is not available"
[09:23:06] <mrittman> its working for me...
[09:23:18] <johnkpaul> hmm, maybe it's me
[09:23:19] <mrittman> over cellular and wifi
[09:23:31] <johnkpaul> yeah, my DNS is gone
[09:23:37] <mrittman> haha no problem
[09:23:40] <johnkpaul> :) will work on that and get back to you
[09:23:47] <johnkpaul> it's so odd when IRC, hulu, and skype all work fine
[09:24:01] <mrittman> haha yeah
[09:25:48] <johnkpaul> mrittman: rather than relative top/left, why not animate to exact positions?
[09:26:32] <mrittman> would that help you think?
[09:26:53] <johnkpaul> yes, the problem is that stop() resets the animation, but it's not in the beginning or ending state
[09:27:20] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: :) , i was out for dinner ..
[09:27:32] <mrittman> hmmm
[09:27:57] <mrittman> so don't use absolute positioning
[09:30:33] <johnkpaul> mrittman: you are using absolute positioning
[09:30:38] <johnkpaul> you're just using relatve adjustments
[09:31:13] <johnkpaul> I wish that chrome allowed you to share modifications of javascript in-place
[09:31:24] <johnkpaul> if I had a URL to send you, that'd be awesome, mrittman
[09:31:25] <mrittman> i'm getting some help
[09:32:23] <mrittman> No problem… I'm on the phone with a guy trying to help me haha
[09:32:48] <Whirl3d_> rabi, I added a blink function for fun. LOL http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TTTLw/122/
[09:34:28] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: had a look, good.... thanks....
[09:34:59] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: there is still lot for it. got to add that in our .net project.... heavy risk ahead....
[09:35:15] <Whirl3d_> weird, though. I can get a blank to pass validation every once in a while
[09:35:16] <rabbi1> if u have a blog i think you can add it there. lot of people will be looking for this ....
[09:35:45] <Whirl3d_> lol it could be done a lot better, I was just playing with it. But thanks...8)
[09:35:50] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: yeah, that's what i asked when you were playing around ...
[09:36:23] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/S8TS2/ Anyone know how to get column and list item ids to save the order of connected sortable lists to mysql?
[09:36:26] <Whirl3d_> it does work most of the time, but for some reason, it's not validating correctly
[09:37:36] <Whirl3d_> now I can't get it to mess up. ?
[09:37:49] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: weird, when implemented before, it was not validating for the first element ... :( yesterday
[09:37:56] <br4ndon> Hi there
[09:39:46] <br4ndon> I'm trying to build up a menu so users can change the font as they want
[09:40:02] <br4ndon> http://pastebin.com/Qh9JsvGB
[09:40:17] <br4ndon> But can't figure out how to
[09:40:40] <donnaR> hey jq, is there any youtube api wrapper on jq?
[09:40:43] <br4ndon> create a <a> link to do that instead of clicking in the div
[09:41:09] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: why not?
[09:47:12] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @br4ndon
[09:47:12] <bot-t> br4ndon, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[09:48:13] <br4ndon> johnkpaul: thanks a lot! I'm going to read that
[09:48:24] <johnkpaul> no problem, br4ndon
[09:50:37] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, I think it has to do with the change of focus. If you fill in a required field, then change focus, change back to remove the required field entry , click on another ...it's not invalidating the field because it's not able to tell that that's not the field's original state...
[09:51:54] <Whirl3d_> and as a convenience, your form validator won't go through and immediately make your required, but empty fields all blank... it assumes that the last required blank is only that way because you haven't filled it in ...yet
[09:52:57] <br4ndon> johnkpaul: why not <a href="javascript:typo()">somelink</a> ?
[09:53:28] <johnkpaul> br4ndon: that would probably work, but it's a bad practice
[09:53:29] <johnkpaul> ?g unobtrusive javascript @br4ndon
[09:53:31] <bot-t> br4ndon, Unobtrusive JavaScript - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript
[09:53:53] <br4ndon> thanks again :D
[09:54:03] <johnkpaul> np
[09:54:13] <Whirl3d_> johnkapul, can I ask you a really abstract question that's kinda hard to figure out how to ask...?
[09:55:50] <Whirl3d_> I have a couple of functions that "initialize" content. I create a deferred object in the init function and return it's promise. Once I am don initializing the item, I resolve the init...The idea is that next time I can call init() and it will immediately be resolved if already initialized.
[09:57:10] <Whirl3d_> so should I store the promise or the deferred in the initiliazed object's data object?
[10:00:29] <br4ndon> johnkpaul: Trigger only seems to work with buttons, not with <a>
[10:00:45] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: sorry, I didn't see IRC because my name was spelled incorrectly
[10:00:58] <johnkpaul> a deferred is what can be used to resolve or reject, not a promise
[10:01:16] <johnkpaul> you should store a promise I believe
[10:01:17] <Whirl3d_> right but the promise would give the state, right?
[10:01:26] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: give the state?
[10:01:36] <Whirl3d_> resolved, rejected, or pending...
[10:01:38] <johnkpaul> br4ndon: .trigger() works with any elements that you've previously added events to
[10:01:50] <mrittman> johnkpaul, she's working now!
[10:01:53] <mrittman> http://www.phillipsfloors.com/
[10:01:57] <johnkpaul> br4ndon: $('div').click(handler);... later in your code $('div').trigger('click') will fire handler
[10:02:12] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: yes, it will, but a promise is unable to change the state
[10:02:26] <johnkpaul> the promise has no .resolve/With or .reject/With
[10:02:47] <johnkpaul> mrittman: awesome
[10:02:49] <imsky> abjorn, lol what happened at 3 am
[10:02:49] <bot-t> (11 hours 3 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky FUCK YOU IM DURNK N UR NOT HERE GOD DAM,NIT
[10:02:55] <imsky> got it
[10:03:16] <Whirl3d_> lol
[10:03:30] <Whirl3d_> sounds like somebody has a drunken crush
[10:04:42] <imsky> i'm his AA buddy
[10:05:20] <Whirl3d_> wow, man, that's heavy...lol
[10:05:30] <imsky> heavy drinking
[10:05:40] <Whirl3d_> heavy reliance on irc for support,
[10:05:46] <Whirl3d_> of a different kind.
[10:05:48] <Whirl3d_> lol
[10:06:01] <imsky> true true
[10:08:31] <Whirl3d_> so internally, jquery looks at animate like:   $(elem).animate(props, speed)....interesting...
[10:11:07] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: so, it's still not good to use ?
[10:12:53] <Whirl3d_> to be honest, rabbi1, I think that it will undergo a lot of changes before your final implementation. Right now it works *most* of the time, so perhaps you should worrry about the rest of it and worry about the odd exception at the end. Chances are you are going to implement this entire thing differently by the time you are done...at least that's been my experience.
[10:14:06] <Whirl3d_> otherwise, you'll spend all of your time hunting down this one little error in something simple like your basic contact form...(not saying that's what this is, just that that's the pattern)
[10:21:24] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: will surely have to look at the alternate .... :)
[10:21:24] <rabbi1> basic javascript will be ok
[10:23:31] <Whirl3d_> say what? You are so close.. you are just missing the odd case that someone changes focus on the last required input leaving it blank before switching tabs---that's not gonna happen too often and if it does, catch it serverside on submit.
[10:24:27] <Whirl3d_> much better plan that just writing off the last 12 hours of learning jquery (and doing a pretty good job of learning it at that).
[10:27:32] <rabbi1> :) lol
[10:27:36] <Whirl3d_> johnkpaul, can I get the link to your evented jquery script fiddle you showed me?
[10:28:30] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/pXDt9/
[10:28:40] <johnkpaul> As soon as jqconf is over, I will write a blog post
[10:28:57] <johnkpaul> I wish there was a way to force myself to be accountable to statements like that
[10:29:39] <arcanin> how can I use clearQueue() with jquery ui ?

[10:33:29] <anew> i dont understand when listening for events, if the only jq that is showing in the call stack is jQuery v1.7.1 for example... how is that possible, are there no functions written?
[10:33:40] <abjorn> imsky: ...o.O where did that conclusion even come from
[10:33:47] <imsky> lawl
[10:34:12] <abjorn> no, i invited friends over and got very drunk, and they went home and then I was home by myself with nothing to do but drunk text people

[10:48:01] <imsky> you must have this chan confused with ##jquery
[10:48:02] <imsky> noob
[10:48:11] <abjorn> rofl
[10:48:42] <Quick> ...
[10:48:46] <Whirl3d_> Quick, you see the problem with these two is that they are a couple of the brightest jquery people out there. And they are both really helpful. So they spam the channel, it's worth puttin up with because they are so helpful. really.
[10:49:03] <Quick> gotcha whril, thx
[10:49:45] <Whirl3d_> just don't let their sense of humor get you down. They have gone out of there way to help me on numerous occasions.  What do you need help with?
[10:49:51] <imsky> GOAT ROMNEY
[10:50:18] <texta> Ooh, one more thing. My onClick function doesn't work for new divs I create after the page has loaded. Where else can I put my onClick besides document.ready?
[10:50:33] <Quick> so whirl/abjorn / imsky,, is there a way to use the .on function that will allow me block left click, but allow middleclick (opens new tab in chrome); i've been using something like elem.on("mousedown",function) and also elem.on("click",function) to attempt to fix this
[10:50:47] <imsky> Quick, obviously
[10:51:02] <Whirl3d_> texta, it's not so much where in terms of document ready, but rather where you attach your ".on("click",    handlers.
[10:51:35] <Quick> texta, you could also use elem.click(function)... i believe?
[10:52:00] <texta> Oh, I am, I just need to work out where to put it :3
[10:52:39] <Whirl3d_> texta, you need to find an element that exists at the time you are binding your click handler that is up the heirarchy from the element you want to catch the click events on.  In other words it's parent or grandparent, etc.
[10:52:51] <imsky> Quick, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/kxgQN/
[10:53:20] <Quick> imsky you sir are a genius
[10:53:22] <Quick> much appreciated
[10:53:23] <Whirl3d_> because the click event is "bubbled up", all the elements above the clicked element recieve the click as well. * unless prevented
[10:53:33] <Whirl3d_> Quick.. Told ya!
[10:54:20] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: yeah! that's the point, it's realy useful on legacy spaghetti codebases
[10:54:23] <imsky> quick that's not really the whole solution
[10:54:32] <Quick> oh?
[10:54:33] <texta> Well, my divs are created inside a large main div.
[10:54:38] <texta> So that should work  :)
[10:55:06] <abjorn> yo dawg i herd you like divs
[10:55:10] <Whirl3d_> texta, so use this: $("largerdiv").on("click", ".smallerClass", function (e) {
[10:55:27] <imsky> Quick, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/kxgQN/1/
[10:55:40] <Whirl3d_> then as you add .smallerClass elements, they are still handled by the largerdiv
[10:55:51] <imsky> click won't register for middle mouse button, Quick
[10:55:59] <imsky> but left mouse button registers for all 3
[10:56:15] <Quick> could you explain a little more about what you mean by the registers comment?
[10:56:39] <imsky> if you say $("a").on("click", function(e){console.log(e)}) and middle-click a link, you'll see nothing
[10:56:58] <Whirl3d_> johnkpaul, if you ask me, it should be part of jquery core...to me it seems more fundamental to the core than a lot of existing core methods...
[10:57:22] <johnkpaul> well it encourages a way of programming that is not ideal
[10:57:36] <johnkpaul> ideally, you know your application and can fire events customized to your sitaution
[10:57:36] <Whirl3d_> you mean, jquery? LOL
[10:57:42] <johnkpaul> rather than relying on jquery methods itself
[10:57:56] <Quick> so imsky, that's why you used mousedown
[10:58:02] <johnkpaul> rather than .on('before_append'), .on('new_message') makes  alot more sense
[10:58:04] <imsky> and mouseup and click
[10:58:22] <imsky> if you don't preventDefault on those, the left click still goes ahead
[10:58:50] <Whirl3d_> Do you have a favorite reference for good programming techniques or best practices?
[10:59:13] <Quick> I see, thanks a ton
[10:59:55] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: hmm, there are many out there, I don't know of any particular books or referneces
[11:00:11] <johnkpaul> I'm currently almost finished maintainable javascript
[11:00:24] <johnkpaul> book by nicholas zakas on oreilly
[11:00:48] <abjorn> Javascript: The Good Parts
[11:00:51] <abjorn> short and sweet
[11:00:56] <imsky> javascript: the best parts
[11:01:04] <abjorn> javascript: the even better parts
[11:01:11] <johnkpaul> that's true, tgp has javascript best pratices, although some would disagree
[11:01:14] <imsky> javascript: the 'you lookin' at me?' parts
[11:01:21] <abjorn> the ones who disagree can suck it
[11:01:23] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: what I was just mentioning is just a general programming best practice
[11:01:28] <johnkpaul> separation of concerns and modularity
[11:01:32] <abjorn> javascript: the nanabooboo im better than you parts
[11:01:39] <bindi> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/load.php?lastid=0 How can I see that the "comments:" or "replies:" have something inside them? http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/ for my javascript
[11:01:45] <johnkpaul> there's clean code by bob martin that describes all of the "SOLID" principles
[11:01:48] <ravenzz> the very best parts http://youtu.be/kXEgk1Hdze0?t=1m21s
[11:01:49] <johnkpaul> even though I dont' remember what they are
[11:02:00] <bindi> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/load.php?lastid=13 you see here, there's no "comments" but only replies.. and my code doesn't work then

[11:02:57] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: I have to head out, but I'll think about your question and get back to you
[11:02:59] <abjorn> lol okay you win imsky
[11:03:09] <johnkpaul> it'd be good to compile a list for those that are interested
[11:03:22] <johnkpaul> other than just say get onto twitter and follow these few hundred people
[11:03:37] <imsky> just got an idea
[11:03:46] <imsky> instead of prototype.toString.call bla bla bla for type checking

[11:15:26] <someprimetime> when I'm using serialize() is it possible to find out the type of input fields that are being serialized? e.g. textarea vs. checkbox vs. input?
[11:15:38] <someprimetime> input type=text* rather
[11:15:53] <SoulRaven> like width: 'auto', minWidth: 600 (but the min width to be the minwidth of the dialog open)

[11:45:32] <TeddyMurray> any ideas?
[11:48:20] <fotis> any recommendations for a javascript MVC framework other than backbone?
[11:50:14] <rodd> $( 'div.element' ).load().. would that affect all of its child elements (which include images) ?
[11:52:11] <LennyLinux> @fotis whats wrong with Backbone?
[11:57:52] <fotis> LennyLinux: I have already used an MVC framework at the server (django) and I am looking something simpler than backbone for the client.
[11:58:38] <Jon471> backbone only makes sense if you're making a client-side application
[12:00:47] <fotis> Jon471: I am using a Restfull api to retrieve some data via ajax.
[12:01:12] <Jon471> if you're just writing webpages with a little bit of UI, it's probably simpler to use a more traditional script architecture (i.e. no architecture, or maybe just name-spaced functions in an object literal)
[12:01:40] <Jon471> fotis that sounds like a good candidate for backbone!
[12:05:48] <fotis> Jon471:  I will give it a second try. Thanks a lot.
[12:06:35] <Jon471> fotis wait i just joined, gimme more info
[12:07:19] <Jon471> are you making an app that is taking full advantage of the REST API, ie, creating, retrieving, updating and deleting items?
[12:07:41] <Jon471> is it a rich application or are you just grabbing some data one time and rendering it?
[12:08:56] <Jon471> if you just wanna populate a template with some data you got from the web you should feel ok to not use backbone for that
[12:10:28] <rodd> How may I run a callback when all children of an element are done loading (images/etc)?
[12:10:42] <rodd> I know, window.load(), but this comes from a remote request
[12:11:41] <rodd> so a callback for window.load() will have already been called, I've tried $('#elem').load() but I guess that's wrong (which is a div)
[12:11:54] <fotis> it's actually a rich client but I think backbone is an overkill for this application. I am already using handlebars and the code is clean. but my boss suggested to use an javascript MVC framework that's why i am researching.
[12:12:32] <rodd> fotis why don't you tell your boss that it's an overkill? explain the facts to him
[12:13:59] <Jon471> it sounds like you're on the right track, just do your research and make up your mind, i'm sure your boss will trust your decision either way as long as it's an informed and careful decision
[12:14:20] <Jon471> rodd http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:14:42] <rodd> Been there
[12:14:46] <Jon471> the load event theoretically fires when an element and all of its sub-elements have been loaded
[12:15:07] <Jon471> i personally have, in the past, discovered that images which are already in the browser cache do not necessarily fire the load event
[12:15:12] <Jon471> i think at least in Chrome
[12:15:16] <Jon471> maybe that's standard behavior
[12:16:33] <rodd> in my situation it's a google webfont font that's influencing in the div height
[12:16:55] <rodd> so hm
[12:17:15] <comet`> hello, just wonder, how would one get the rendered height of a div's contents
[12:17:37] <rodd> comet` $( '.div' ).height / outerHeight / outerHeight(true)
[12:17:58] <comet`> .height() seems to just take the css('height') value
[12:18:24] <rodd> outerHeight include paddings, passing true, margins
[12:18:47] <comet`> absolutly positioned divs can have heights bigger than their parents
[12:19:15] <comet`> so $(parent).height(), doesnt get then height of its children
[12:19:29] <comet`> just of itself, which can be 0
[12:20:45] <comet`> i can't just .children().each() the children and get the sum of their heights either, since some divs are side by side
[12:21:30] <rodd> comet` I have come to that issue yesterday, however, in my case, I could specify the proper element in order to get the original height
[12:21:44] <gowie> Has anyone run into a problem with overriding a elements data with the $(element).data('attr', attrValue)?? Particularly it not overriding that attr when called again?
[12:21:50] <rodd> I don't know how you'd do that from a parent element without going to its children
[12:21:54] <rodd> maybe someone else here knows
[12:22:23] <anew> if there is a hover effect in the css... .why then when i set a listener there is a breakpoint and jquery libraries associated with the event??
[12:22:36] <comet`> i suppose i could come up with some way of calucating it from offsets also
[12:23:05] <Jon471> anew: probably because it's breaking on something else, :hover is purely css, no js invovled
[12:24:24] <anew> hmmmm
[12:26:13] <anew> jon471 if it's breaking on something else, why when i step thru only jq libraries are showing in the stack trace (biggest question here)
[12:26:30] <Jon471> anew can i see the code?
[12:26:32] <anew> if there is a written function to be associated with an event... shouldn't there always be something else in there other than jq libraries ?
[12:26:48] <anew> yeah can i pm u
[12:26:51] <rodd> gowie got a fiddle?
[12:27:23] <fotis> any thoughts on ember.js?
[12:28:38] <gowie> rodd ill see if i can throw one together that demonstrates my problem.
[12:28:58] <Jon471> i briefly looked at ember.js, knockout.js, and backbone and determined that backbone was the best choice because it's the most minimal and has the largest community, but you might have other critieria
[12:29:21] <Jon471> honestly it might be a good idea to implement your app in every MVC you can find and then make the decision
[12:29:33] <Jon471> i'm sure you gotta use these things for awhile before you really understand what's good and what's not so good about each
[12:30:27] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/S8TS2/10/ I'm trying to use jquery connected sortables and update the li moves in the database. I'm lost.
[12:30:56] <fotis> Jon471: You are awesome, thanks.
[12:31:41] <anew> jon471 if i create a listener, and the console pauses on the event........why would it pause on only jq libraries is the question
[12:32:06] <Jon471> anew you scanned the entire stack trace and it only ever shows jquery functions?
[12:32:36] <Jon471> can you not show me the code, it would be a lot easier for us to help you out if we could look at it instead of trusting your descriptions to tell us everything we need to know
[12:33:30] <comet`> http://jsfiddle.net/FMqNP/3/
[12:33:40] <comet`> anybody want to help?
[12:34:07] <comet`> rodd: I believe this shows my problem better
[12:34:16] <gowie> rodd thanks for the suggestion, but this is going to take too long to get a fiddle up haha. I think I'll just keep googling around and reading some documentation.
[12:34:54] <anew> jon471 i dont even know what i would show u... the webpage itself ?...
[12:35:09] <anew> there isnt any jq code, it just goes to the library that's what i'm confused about
[12:35:11] <anew> can i pm you ?
[12:36:50] <rodd> comet` similar to what I came through yesterday
[12:38:24] <rodd> gowie $(element).data('attr', attrValue) that should overwrite attr, unless you mean the data-attr attribute in your element
[12:38:45] <comet`> basically if i search entire children tree and get the div with the largest (height + top), with no children
[12:39:04] <comet`> that should be it really
[12:39:13] <gowie> comet So why not try that?
[12:39:26] <rodd> yes, in my case I used .children()
[12:39:39] <comet`> because i dont now how to recursively search in js
[12:39:55] <comet`> i might need the children() of children() of children()
[12:39:56] <fotis> Murg|e: You might want to use toArray to take the position of every li and then store it in the database when the sorting is complete
[12:40:33] <comet`> well it probably not going to be more than 5 or 6 levels deep
[12:40:45] <gowie> rodd And yeah i know it should, but in some cases it is not, and I am not sure why... It works sometimes and then not others. It's odd. And nah i wasn't looking for it to actually change the dom element to have a data-attr with that attr, just have the .data('attr') return attrValue
[12:41:03] <Murg|e> Fotis: Would that include the id for each column as well as the order in each column?
[12:41:45] <gowie> comet Google js recursion, i know there is not tail recursion and the stack does exhaust at some point, but that seems like what you're going to need to do.
[12:42:33] <comet`> or google find children recursively and see that $(this).find('*'); returns all decendents... :P
[12:42:38] <fotis> Murg|e: exactly. Check out the docs http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[12:43:05] <gowie> haha that works too
[12:43:42] <rodd> that's nasty
[12:45:18] <gowie> rodd What the .find(*)?
[12:47:29] <comet`> http://jsfiddle.net/FMqNP/4/
[12:47:33] <comet`> it works nicely though
[12:47:36] <comet`> :)
[12:47:55] <comet`> i always think as soon as you ask someone it becomes much easier
[12:48:20] <bindi> what's the best way of doing reply buttons and form to reply in a comment system? should I just hide a 5-liner form in all of the comments and show as necessary? that seems like waste of lines though..
[12:48:28] <anew> jon471 saved my life, listen to him people
[12:48:28] <anew> brb
[12:48:59] <comet`> i think the trick is, by putting it in a form to explain it to someone else, you see it more clear yourself
[12:49:17] <gowie> comet Definitely true, unless its one of the questions that you think is just out of your knowledge range.
[12:51:36] <comet`> damn, forgot about the offset bit
[12:52:09] <rodd> comet` I'd instead use $("#parent").find("div")
[12:52:22] <rodd> or, .find('.aClassName')
[12:52:54] <rodd> that if all children from which would have the highest height are a div and have .aClassName in common
[12:53:11] <comet`> would an object, with position: absolute, but no top set, return .css("top") as 0?
[12:54:39] <comet`> yes
[12:54:44] <comet`> well it return 0px
[13:01:13] <rodd> yikes, 5pm an im still stuck in my code
[13:05:37] <comet`> http://jsfiddle.net/FMqNP/5/
[13:05:46] <comet`> there, takes the .offset() into account
[13:06:33] <comet`> and no matter how many children, will return the absolute maximum between top of parent and bottom of children
[13:07:04] <comet`> im using this so i can dyamically make the height of the parent be slightly greater than than of its children
[13:07:16] <comet`> probably a bit overkill though :P
[13:07:36] <rodd> comet` hope you won't have to do that for content that comes from a remote request
[13:07:59] <rodd> or else, maybe, we'll be in the same boat
[13:08:00] <comet`> not really
[13:08:16] <comet`> it dyamic content
[13:08:46] <rodd> I have to get the height of an element after all of its children are done loading
[13:08:54] <comet`> well dynamic in so far as that its all on the same page, and use jquery to slide the next block of text in, and old block out
[13:09:02] <rodd> however that doesn't seem to work with cached images and embedded fonts
[13:09:15] <comet`> while making the image background fit to new content (this piece of code)
[13:09:59] <comet`> well it shoudl work with cached images
[13:10:25] <comet`> as cached images just mean it reads from client side cache rather than server
[13:11:19] <rodd> Thing is, I have a post and a sidebar, I must collapse the sidebar to the post's height. All content from post must be done loading in order to get its proper height
[13:11:23] <comet`> i can see the problem with embedded fonts though
[13:12:16] <comet`> yeah, so add a call back on its request finished
[13:12:19] <rodd> I could do some hacks but that would be ugly
[13:12:52] <rodd> I execute it in the callback of infinite scroll
[13:13:33] <rodd> hm hang on
[13:14:14] <rodd> nah
[13:15:40] <rodd> I can get around the font issue by using .ready in the infinitescroll callback and .load on document load
[13:15:58] <rodd> but then there are still images

[13:33:23] <comet`> i would of guess because its the 9th largest channel by user count

[13:34:28] <gnarf> (or even 5)
[13:36:27] <nFFF> whats wrong with bot-t?
[13:43:56] <Whirl3d_> Hey all. I have a div with an ul menu in it. Suddenly the menu has become unresponsive. So I setup a click handler for the document to find out what was receiving click events. It claims that my "main" div (which is abvove the menu heirarchically) is the target of the click event. How could this have happened?
[13:44:58] <j0ls0n> How would I access a child object like wysiwyg.instances.edit-body …? I keep getting 'body' is undefined
[13:47:25] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, when you click the ul menu in it
[13:47:28] <nFFF> you also click the div
[13:47:33] <nFFF> its event bubbling
[13:48:03] <Whirl3d_> sure but I don't have the event bound to the div, I have it boudn to the anchor elements in the menu in the div
[13:48:17] <Whirl3d_> and event.target should still indicate the anchor element
[13:48:21] <Whirl3d_> even with bubbling
[13:50:30] <nFFF> jsfiddle
[13:50:30] <nFFF> :D
[13:50:32] <Whirl3d_> in fact, double checking my code. There are no Click events or "on" events anywhere except to my nav items--which aren't responding. They aren't even doing the css :hover thing?
[13:50:37] <Whirl3d_> Will do, thanks.
[13:51:53] <comet`> id put money on a syntex error
[13:52:18] <comet`> no offence, but im after having so many little things today
[13:52:42] <comet`> like in one css file i was mussing an : the middle of a block of code
[13:52:52] <Nitrxgen> I don't suppose on the off chance somebody here has devcpp installed?
[13:53:00] <comet`> i spent an hour figuring out why the element was ignore
[13:53:03] <rodd> comet` use any IDE?
[13:53:20] <comet`> vim...
[13:53:32] <rodd> I see
[13:53:51] <rodd> I like netbeans, even though it's somewhat heavy
[13:53:51] <comet`> loads some stuff with php, so editing live on server is handiest
[13:54:02] <Nitrxgen> take that as a no
[13:54:20] <comet`> well if its a C or C++ question ask away
[13:54:31] <comet`> or even a general C/C++ IDE question
[13:54:35] <Nitrxgen> devcpp is bitching about not having make.exe
[13:54:45] <Nitrxgen> for some reason, any install I use for it doesn't include it
[13:54:49] <comet`> then you need to tweak you PATH
[13:54:53] <Nitrxgen> and can't find it anywhere
[13:54:57] <comet`> its included with MinGW
[13:55:13] <comet`> C:\MinGW\bin\make.exe usually
[13:55:31] <Nitrxgen> http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html - ok, so I'll chose which one?
[13:55:40] <Nitrxgen> 5 beta, or stable 4
[13:56:23] <systemfault> None of them.
[13:56:24] <comet`> it shouldnt matter
[13:56:24] <Nitrxgen> actually, the 4 leads to error 404 on the download link, useful
[13:56:47] <comet`> just make sure you get the one with MinGW/GCC with it
[13:56:56] <comet`> http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe
[13:56:57] <Nitrxgen> ok
[13:57:01] <systemfault> FFS
[13:57:09] <comet`> ?
[13:57:17] <systemfault> Don't give people shit advices.
[13:57:24] <comet`> what?
[13:57:34] <Nitrxgen> didn't know I needed the mingw thing
[13:57:43] <systemfault> DevC++ is a dead product and the compiler shipped with it is prehistoric
[13:57:45] <comet`> he asked why he didnt have MinGW installed, so I have him a link to install it
[13:58:00] <comet`> yeah, so?
[13:58:07] <systemfault> Ok.. fuck you.
[13:58:08] <comet`> some college courses require it
[13:58:15] <Nitrxgen> systemfault, I'm a learner, like I give a shit for the best compiler
[13:58:17] <comet`> my answer was valid
[13:58:48] <Nitrxgen> in fact I only need to make a couple of things to run once and that's it
[13:59:15] <comet`> you can use the command line then
[13:59:22] <comet`> no real need for an IDE at all
[13:59:37] <anew> it's strange, if u click inside a checkbox and have a dom breakpoint set, it does not fire, yet if u click outside it does
[13:59:39] <anew> i cant figure it out
[13:59:49] <Nitrxgen> it'll just be console stuff
[13:59:56] <anew> jon47 are you jon471 ?
[13:59:57] <comet`> ...
[14:00:09] <Nitrxgen> anyway, sorry for talking about non-jquery stuff
[14:00:31] <comet`> Nitrxgen: you can compile C and C++ code using a command on the command prompt
[14:00:47] <comet`> in fact, an IDE is basically a wrapper for the command line compiler
[14:01:12] <Nitrxgen> I'm a gui whore, but what the final product will be is cli
[14:01:20] <knite> I'm using http://aehlke.github.com/tag-it/ for jquery autocomplete. it's built on top of jquery ui autocomplete, but doesn't support all of autocomplete's options. if I want to specify, for example, minLength, is there any way to pass that on from tag-it to autocomplete?
[14:01:27] <comet`> you said it was just for a couple of things
[14:01:38] <Nitrxgen> right
[14:01:40] <knite> a quick look at the code suggests that I need to fork it and add back in any features I need from autocomplete.
[14:01:42] <Nitrxgen> :p
[14:01:59] <comet`> "gcc <input file> -o <output file>.exe" is fairly simple
[14:02:25] <Nitrxgen> don't worry about it, I got what I wanted now
[14:06:31] <j0ls0n> I'm trying to access an object within an object but firebug says it is undefined
[14:06:31] <anew> anyone know about break attributes modifications
[14:09:13] <comet`> j0ls0n: then its undefined
[14:09:19] <comet`> at least at the time you access it
[14:09:30] <comet`> :wq
[14:09:42] <comet`> woops, wrong window
[14:11:18] <j0ls0n> comet`: console log shows Object {}, I can click on it and view the object and it's properties
[14:11:46] <comet`> can you jsfiddle it?
[14:12:42] <j0ls0n> comet`: I'll try
[14:13:10] <anew> u need to do a hover before you can do a click
[14:13:16] <anew> hover before click, that's ridiculous
[14:13:20] <anew> cant u just do a click
[14:14:58] <bindi> how can I count number of elements inside something? I used $('#comments div').length() but that counts in stuff like forms inside the divs, I don't want to count them in
[14:17:00] <Jake232> Is there a callback that gets called when a model is UPDATED, as far as I can tell, before_save only seems to work when a model is being created? Although that seems to conflict with the idea that there is also a before_create
[14:17:26] <Jake232> wrong chat
[14:17:27] <Jake232> sorry
[14:18:56] <anew> anyone know about having to set multiple break on attributes modifications
[14:30:47] <comet`> bindi: what sort of things do you want to count
[14:31:02] <bindi> comet`: only the <div> tags
[14:31:31] <comet`> $('#comment').children('div').length() should count all the divs one level down
[14:32:35] <bindi> TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[14:32:49] <comet`> then just length
[14:32:52] <comet`> without the ()
[14:33:02] <bindi> now it's missing some
[14:33:09] <bindi> there should be 24, it says 16
[14:33:34] <comet`> are you looking for all the divs, even grand children?
[14:33:38] <bindi> yes
[14:33:48] <comet`> you see, you should say these things
[14:33:55] <bindi> :p i thought i was clear
[14:34:01] <comet`> $('#comment').find('div').length
[14:34:18] <bindi> 48! twice as much
[14:34:42] <comet`> that might find </div> too
[14:34:44] <comet`> let me check
[14:34:57] <bindi> could just divide it by two
[14:35:34] <gnarf> http://twitter.com/gnarf37/status/216264339429146625 btw
[14:35:35] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from gnarf37: Yay! @jquery 1.8 Beta 1 is in the wild! http://t.co/X8lTWBLw - Please help us test it! #jquery ★ http://bit.ly/O5WzVp
[14:35:36] <comet`> nope, it worked for me
[14:36:10] <comet`> bindi, $('#parent').find("div").length
[14:36:15] <comet`> works for me
[14:36:45] <comet`> recursively all divs that are decendents of #parent
[14:37:20] <bindi> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/ if you wish to look at my godlike code
[14:37:29] <bindi> $('#comments').find('div').length
[14:37:30] <bindi> 48
[14:37:56] <gnarf> bindi: that poll rate on that ajax is insane
[14:38:01] <bindi> maybe
[14:38:09] <bindi> just some 300 bytes a second of bandwidth though
[14:38:15] <comet`> yeah, was about to say that
[14:38:17] <bindi> when it's not receiving anything :p
[14:38:42] <gnech> is there anything in jquery that lets you do reverse ajax
[14:38:59] <gnarf> bindi: you have 16 .comment divs and 32 .reply divs
[14:39:07] <bindi> i do?
[14:39:16] <bindi> hmm
[14:39:27] <gnarf> bindi: take the .length off of the call on the console
[14:39:30] <gnarf> and inspect them
[14:39:38] <comet`> whats the opposite of ajax?
[14:39:46] <systemfault> xaja
[14:40:37] <bindi> gnarf: ahh
[14:40:42] <bindi> how can i filter out classes?
[14:40:47] <gnech> well, that's the term they use to refer to a server pushing stuff to a client without the client specifically asking for it
[14:40:59] <bindi> push? :p
[14:41:04] <systemfault> comet...
[14:41:06] <gnarf> ?filter
[14:41:06] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:41:08] <gnarf> ?not-selector
[14:41:09] <bot-t> gnarf, :not() Selector - Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[14:41:15] <systemfault> comet is a hack to do serverside push
[14:41:19] <gnech> comet`: it's ironic you ask that, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29 -- are you just being difficult?
[14:42:15] <comet`> no, i just thought the opposite of a protocol would be hard to define
[14:42:41] <comet`> a true opposite has to oppose every attribute
[14:42:44] <gnech> well I certainly didn't coin it. I don't know what others typically call it; I'm not a web guy
[14:42:52] <comet`> like the opposite of a donut
[14:43:07] <gnech> which is what
[14:43:15] <comet`> had to be hard, solid, taste bad, have a hole on the outside
[14:43:15] <gnarf> not a donut hole
[14:43:30] <gnech> and must repel cops
[14:43:35] <comet`> exactly
[14:44:04] <comet`> the deeper you get into the list of attributes, the less likely it is you are going to find a true opposite
[14:44:10] <bindi> gnarf: got it, thanks
[14:44:17] <bindi> $('#comments').find('div:not:.vastauslomake').length
[14:44:31] <comet`> eventually you'll need anti atoms
[14:45:24] <comet`> but is an anti atom of say iron, truely the opposite of an atom of iron
[14:45:26] <gnech> well I don't really care about how well the name fits
[14:45:27] <bindi> so, what do you guys say about the interval?
[14:45:35] <gnech> it is called reverse ajax, not "the opposite of ajax"
[14:45:48] <comet`> since they share properties like numbers and forces
[14:46:06] <comet`> so its really infinitely recursive
[14:46:19] <comet`> P = NP
[14:48:46] <Dr-Bombay> drugs
[14:50:44] <Pwnna> why is .unload deprecated?
[14:53:58] <systemfault> It is?
[14:54:05] <systemfault> Why would it be? :/
[14:56:00] <yassine> im trying to set up a carousel using the following plugin http://thomaslanciaux.pro/jquery/jquery_carousel.htm but the <li> elements of the ordered list im trying to use are not showing up only the first element is showing http://atlasloewenherz.dyndns.org/carousel.html anyone have an idea what could be the problem please?
[15:00:28] <MysterOnyx> I have a list with contents filled by a mysql database I want to display, and when a user clicks a button to update it, data is sent to the database via jquery AJAX. I have that part complete, however now I want the list to auto update without refreshing the page. What's the best way to set it up so the list updates? Should I output it via a javascript function and then call the function when
[15:00:29] <MysterOnyx> the AJAX is complete?
[15:02:45] <systemfault> MysterOnyx: You would make a AJAX request that returns JSON and you would use that JSON to refresh the area of the page.
[15:03:33] <MysterOnyx> ok thanks
[15:14:55] <bindi> http://pastebin.com/pSxHJTsJ I have something like this
[15:15:22] <bindi> I want to show the .vastauslomake when I clicky clicky a link
[15:15:27] <bindi> I'm failing with the logic though
[15:55:19] <AcademyIntl> Hey there!  I'm having a unique issue where incrementally grabbing AJAX data (using a lastFetch session variable) isn't working properly.  The first Nth requests fail to realize there's even a session variable set, it only kicks in after a few queries.
[15:55:51] <iLogic> hay guise
[15:56:11] <AcademyIntl> Scenario: When users request data from my server they do so with a lastFetch ID (default: 0).  At max 20 messages are retunred, as well as a new lastFetch ID (session variable).  Each next request should then use that lastFetch ID (say 64919) and get messages since then only.
[15:56:18] <iLogic> i was wondering.. has anyone made a plugin for queuing the .each() function?
[15:56:31] <AcademyIntl> Issue: 20 messages is being returned about 3-5 times and then finally the session kicks in.
[15:56:39] <iLogic> i just did one for my site and was wondering if it was worth to release it
[15:57:29] <AcademyIntl> iLogic: Google "jQuery .each queue plugin"
[15:57:41] <AcademyIntl> iLogic: The first results almost look like tutorials to do just that, but I'm not sure myself.
[15:58:17] <iLogic> yeah, i can google
[15:58:29] <iLogic> haven't found anything at first so i thought about asking here
[15:59:14] <iLogic> also, how do i check for jquery version compatibility? is there history for implementation or something?
[16:04:29] <someprimetime> how would I print out all the "type" keys from this http://jsfiddle.net/zd3Pc/1/
[16:06:19] <gnarf> someprimetime: "print out" ?
[16:06:41] <someprimetime> how can i target all the "type" keys?
[16:06:44] <gnarf> $.each( data, function() { console.log( this.type ); });
[16:06:54] <gnarf> someprimetime: there are a few options
[16:06:59] <gnarf> someprimetime: mostly each and map tho
[16:07:09] <someprimetime> i tried for var key in obj but that printed like every single letter
[16:07:18] <someprimetime> thanks i'll try $.each
[16:12:05] <someprimetime> gnarf: thanks
[16:28:27] <scottstamp> Hah. Figured this channel might exist. Anyone 'ere familiar with .appendTo's AmplifyJS? I'm trying to use it and do a blocking AJAX request.
[16:28:56] <scottstamp> I guess blocking and AJAX kind of conflict. I need to do a *blocking* JSONP GET request. Lol.
[16:29:05] <MysterOnyx> ok I want advice. I want to load several elements on a page that are filled with mysql data. When a button is clicked, I want to send data via AJAX to the database, and then I want the elements to be refreshed. What is the best way to load these elements? When I put them into a function that runs when the document is ready, the elements' jquery functionality is gone, so I have to load them
[16:29:05] <MysterOnyx> before the document is ready.
[16:29:57] <MysterOnyx> fundamentally I don't understand the best way to display elements upon page load such that I can easily refresh them later on.
[16:30:13] <scottstamp> If you need to do the load before the page is fully loaded, your best bet would be to use core JavaScript, avoiding the jQuery library at first, and storing them into an array for later parsing.
[16:30:34] <Whirl3d_> so if you are using html5 elements like <section> and you are running in a non-html5 browser, it will still be able to select those elements using $(select), won't it?
[16:30:51] <Whirl3d_> $('section') rather
[16:30:55] <MysterOnyx> I'm not sure, I'm just using divs
[16:32:08] <Whirl3d_> MysterOnyx, load the content via AJAX and inject it whee you want it
[16:32:47] <Whirl3d_> don't make it take up the enitre page. Break your data into logical pieces and then build you elements as the ajax returns with the mysql data
[16:33:44] <Whirl3d_> for example. I have a series of slides that each contain an image a title and some data about each slide. I load all of that through ajax and then dynamically build each slide and append it to the dom.
[16:34:13] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d_ do you have an example I can look at?
[16:34:22] <gnarf> scottstamp: i don't think jsonp can block
[16:34:28] <Whirl3d_> Actiually, I build the first one, append it to the dom and then build all the others and append them once...
[16:34:39] <gnarf> scottstamp: like you have to defer to inject the script tag for jsonp
[16:34:40] <MysterOnyx> ok
[16:35:15] <gnarf> scottstamp: so it can't ever "block" - although you could jsonp via document.write or whatever during the script loading phase
[16:35:21] <scottstamp> gnarf, that's not really do-able in my application unfortunately. :[
[16:35:25] <gnarf> that could theoritically appear to block
[16:35:45] <scottstamp> is there any way to watch the statement (or do a callback) and handle it when it's ready?
[16:35:50] <gnarf> scottstamp: but thats only going to work during load
[16:35:58] <gnarf> the whole point of jsonp is a callback
[16:36:13] <scottstamp> Yeah, fair point.
[16:36:16] <gnarf> like its how that shit works
[16:36:27] <Whirl3d_> this is a rough rough rough draft, MysterOnyx, but it load the slide data through mysql. Read the log when you load the page to see all the data it loads: http://www.paigeharvey.net/gallery/main-5.html#gallery-birds
[16:36:28] <scottstamp> Bleh. This code is going to be fugly.
[16:37:50] <scottstamp> I'm working on a site that crawls another site's API for data and spits it out in a more user-friendly manner (granted, against their ToS) - but right now I'm handling all the parsing on the server-side. Makes the page take a while to load.
[16:37:56] <zzzrod> Whirl3d_ cool, I was curious with that link and it just crashed firefox
[16:39:23] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d_ when I click on one of your pictures, it takes me to the picture, but I can't do anything else
[16:47:39] <Whirl3d_> Like I said, I just showed you a link to see how you load mysql data.LOL
[16:47:55] <Whirl3d_> this wasn't due for public consumption by a long shot.
[16:48:10] <Whirl3d_> MysterOnyx, do you know how to use Chrome Developer's tools?
[16:54:17] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d_ no I don't
[16:54:21] <licryle> hello, I am having issues with dynamic injection of jqm elements, anyone has dealt with such things before?
[16:54:22] <MysterOnyx> I'd like to know how though
[16:56:08] <iSIEMENS> :) ? what is the language on this site ---> IMPIRAT.COM
[16:56:18] <Whirl3d_> MysterOnyx, before you get into parsing JSON from MYSQL using AJAX, I think it would be wise to get your feet with with a little html, then a little javascript....then some jquery....then tackly MYSQL and stuff. It's not that hard to learn, but you are starting way too far in to have the foundation you need.
[17:01:57] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d_ I hear ya
[17:02:20] <MysterOnyx> unfortunately I have too many grand ideas that need to happen asap lol
[17:03:36] <Whirl3d_> That's when you hire a developer or look for pre-built solutions that you can customize.
[17:03:51] <MysterOnyx> yea I'm trying to go with pre-built
[17:05:01] <Sofox> I'm using an ajax request to load an external webpage, but it doesn't seem to work, I could swear it worked a bit ago, and it's fine if I'm just making a request for a relative page. What could be the problem?
[17:06:02] <iLogic> Sofox: you not showing the code?
[17:06:50] <Sofox> Here we are: http://pastebin.com/0HHXns8q
[17:07:23] <Sofox> If the url field is blank, it returns the html of the page itself just fine, but I can't connect to external websites.
[17:07:28] <Jon47> async: false
[17:07:30] <Jon47> boo
[17:08:04] <iLogic> Sofox: you can't use absolute urls
[17:08:06] <iLogic> i guess
[17:08:14] <iLogic> since you can't cross domain ajax
[17:08:20] <iLogic> * .ajax()
[17:08:51] <iLogic> just use the path for the file you're trying to get
[17:09:31] <Sofox> But this page shows absolute URLs being used: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:10:13] <iLogic> uhmm i didn't not know that :)
[17:11:02] <AcademyIntl> iLogic: Sofox Cross-Domain AJAX requires a header to be set on the server, often done using .htaccess
[17:11:28] <iLogic> yeah, i figured it wasn't that easy
[17:11:36] <Jon47> or you can use jsonp
[17:12:31] <Sofox> Academy: Ah, I getcha.
[17:12:38] <Sofox> I wonder why I thought it was working a bit ago?
[17:12:40] <AcademyIntl> Sofox: Jon47: iLogic jsonp is not restricted by the "same source" policy, therefre you can use it to request the data without issue.
[17:13:01] <AcademyIntl> HOWEVER; you have another option: http://ajaxian.com/archives/using-yql-as-a-proxy-for-cross-domain-ajax
[17:13:05] <iLogic> sofox: but are you doing it cross domain?
[17:13:13] <iLogic> if not just use the path
[17:13:42] <Sofox> I'm trying to write a program that accesses a web page.. and basically scrapes it for a few bits of info.
[17:14:10] <AcademyIntl> Sofox: This is exactly what YQL does already.
[17:14:17] <AcademyIntl> Sofox: Please see the article I posted.
[17:14:51] <Sofox> Ah, okay Academy
[17:15:02] <Sofox> Damn, I hope it wasn't my own stupidity that forced him to leave the room.
[17:15:21] <Hvernignet> Hello
[17:16:12] <Jon47> haha, dont' worry about that
[17:16:15] <Jon47> the channel is for asking questions
[17:16:22] <Jon47> he's not obligated to answer
[17:16:33] <Sofox> It was nice of him.
[17:16:38] <Sofox> Looking up his answer right now.
[17:23:46] <MysterOnyx> jquery functions don't work on html elements that are added after document ready. How do I get them to work on these elements?
[17:26:02] <Jon47> MysterOnyx: understand the browser event model and what you're actually doing when bind handlers to elements
[17:26:40] <MysterOnyx> Jon47 do you know of a good tutorial for that
[17:27:55] <Jon47> MysterOnyx: this is pretty old but i remember it helped me to understand it
[17:27:56] <Jon47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVpb-dkajs4
[17:28:10] <MysterOnyx> thanks
[17:28:20] <Jon47> it uses the .delegate method with has been superceded by .on in jquery 1.7, but if you understand what .delegate does then .on will be easy
[17:28:33] <MysterOnyx> ok
[17:28:42] <Jon47> the crux of the issue is that you can only bind event handlers to existing elements
[17:28:55] <Whirl3d_> but undertanding basic html and javascript will help you even more than learning various event binding methods.
[17:28:57] <Jon47> (obviously)
[17:29:08] <Jon47> but events "bubble" up the DOM
[17:29:21] <Jon47> and keep a record of what element they originated from
[17:29:30] <teear> dick my dom up
[17:29:41] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d_ I have a pretty good grasp on html and javascript
[17:30:30] <Jon47> so you can bind events to elements that currently exist and will be the parent of elements you plan to add in the future
[17:30:47] <Whirl3d_> how is it possible that you don't know how to use Chrome's developer tools and the console?
[17:31:01] <chilversc> Jon47: yeah, html really needs to catch up when it comes to CDNs and resources
[17:31:11] <Jon47> what
[17:31:14] <MysterOnyx> when you say chrome's developer tools, do you mean the console and everything that pops up when you do inspect element?
[17:31:27] <Whirl3d_> lol that'd be them
[17:31:34] <teear> dick my shitdick dom up dickalickarockenrolla jizzlejsfiddle
[17:31:42] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d_ ok ya I've been using them for a long time
[17:31:50] <chilversc> Jon47: ie, so you can specify that a resource can be found at multiple urls (in preference order)
[17:31:55] <Whirl3d_> that's where I told you to look for the output from my mysql script
[17:32:08] <MysterOnyx> yea I honestly didn't bother because your page killed my browser
[17:32:14] <MysterOnyx> but I got what you meant
[17:32:14] <Jon47> chilversc:  i dunno what brought that up
[17:32:24] <Jon47> i think html handles it just fine
[17:32:25] <teear> yee shure yee can wrote code stuff yee hippie?
[17:32:25] <chilversc> Jon47: that youtube video
[17:33:06] <Jon47> chilversc: the video i posted was Jonathan Sharp's 5 Jquery mistakes webcast?
[17:33:13] <Jon47> what's that gotta do with CDNs
[17:33:13] <chilversc> Jon47: yup
[17:33:24] <chilversc> Jon47: its the 5th point
[17:33:31] <Jon47> ah, ha
[17:33:32] <teear> Jon47 would make 47 mistakes
[17:33:57] <Jon47> i haven't watched it in years
[17:34:11] <Jon47> i just remember the whole DOM bubbling event delegation stuff clicking when i watched it
[17:34:24] <teear> You would jquery yeer grandmother and think it was hot
[17:34:49] <teear> Jonman
[17:34:54] <systemfault> Seems there's no OP to take out the garbages....
[17:35:13] <Jon47> talkign about teear? I ignored him after the first comment
[17:35:32] <systemfault> Right.
[17:35:56] <StayInSkool> Hey guys! I'll try to keep it short but dense: I'm trying to make a scrollbar for the whole document, so the main document scrollbar moves 'in sync' with it. I've used a `draggable` to animate document's scrollTop. But, with this approach scrolling becomes erratic, and promptly 'jumps' to the bottom of the document
[17:36:27] <teear> systemfault was talkin about you johnny boy
[17:36:37] <StayInSkool> I've considered a draggable emitting too many drag events a possibility, but even with a boolean flag to only execute one handler at a time, it's still very jumpy
[17:36:51] <MysterOnyx> lol I love it when kids try to be trolls
[17:37:04] <StayInSkool> whoops. did I walk in on a discussion?
[17:37:10] <systemfault> MysterOnyx: You need to be intelligent to troll...
[17:37:18] <snover> poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop
[17:37:24] <StayInSkool> I've just bumped my head against this for a few days, and was too frustrated to jump dump my problems onto you ahah
[17:37:53] <bindi> how can I reduce the headers with an ajax request?
[17:38:03] <StayInSkool> .replace{/jump/, 'just');
[17:38:14] <StayInSkool> did I win over a minute of your time with probably incorrect literal regex? :D
[17:38:41] <texta> Can someone take a look at one of my divs and tell me why it's not centering properly? D:
[17:38:43] <StayInSkool> I think the next meme after </sarcasm> and other faux-XML will be either faux-JSON, or faux-Javascript
[17:39:09] <texta> http://pastie.org/private/9zvi2osrg5ntm7c2xlf2bw
[17:39:11] <texta> <3
[17:40:41] <teear> You've not centered teh div
[17:41:03] <texta> Even if margin-left if half the size of the div
[17:41:12] <texta> it's still not exactly centered horizontally
[17:41:19] <texta> I don't want it vertically centered :3
[17:41:24] <texta> is*
[17:41:48] <StayInSkool> your nicknames are hard to distinguish!!
[17:42:43] <indistinguishabl> Damn.
[17:42:46] <indistinguishabl> Character limit.
[17:43:08] <indistinguishabl> Waittt.
[17:43:14] <StayInSkool> is there one for IRC? what is it?
[17:43:19] <Jon47> StayInSkool: can i ask why you want to create a scrollbar when the browser's already got a perfectly good one?
[17:43:24] <indistinguished> Meh
[17:43:30] <StayInSkool> Jon47: it's a long story :P
[17:43:52] <StayInSkool> because I want it to. because I want to make something that uses it :D
[17:44:00] <Jon47> StayInSkool: check out http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[17:44:26] <teear> Why do you wanna suck your mother when you could a have a girlfriend
[17:44:27] <Jon47> it works pretty well, if you don't want to re-invent the wheel
[17:44:39] <Jon47> and if oyu insist in re-inventing the wheel, maybe you can check out his code for some tips at least
[17:44:43] <StayInSkool> Jon47: I'll check it out! thanks!
[17:45:05] <StayInSkool> I'm not trying to invent the same thing. It's like a chrome plugin that adds a UI element
[17:45:20] <StayInSkool> which has to move around in sync with a scroller, and be able to control scrolling as well
[17:45:25] <Jon47> you should be aware that the scrollbar is quite different depending on your OS
[17:45:32] <StayInSkool> yep. quite aware
[17:45:47] <StayInSkool> i wish everything was like Lion or Unity/Gnome 3, but it's very much not
[17:46:01] <Jon47> in OS X Lion it's a little pill that lays on top of the document, depending on your settings it might disappear shortly after you stop scrolling
[17:46:10] <Jon47> and when you scroll to the top of bottom of the doc it compresses
[17:46:14] <StayInSkool> Jon47: if it did I would be thankful
[17:46:15] <teear> I'd reinvent the wheel if the other option would be...
[17:46:18] <Jon47> in Unity it's some crazy thing, and in windows some other damn thing
[17:46:35] <Jon47> and there's probably tons of other UIs I  have never used before
[17:46:56] <StayInSkool> Jon47: yep. don't worry, I won't be reckless with that information :P
[17:47:13] <StayInSkool> and rape poor visitors' brains with yet another attempt to re-do what browsers should fix upstream
[17:47:19] <Jon47> lol
[17:47:23] <Jon47> ok good luck brother!
[17:47:27] <StayInSkool> cheers!
[17:47:43] <Jon47> actually one more piece of advice
[17:47:48] <StayInSkool> yep!
[17:47:53] <Jon47> don't attach your function directly to a scroll event handler
[17:48:06] <StayInSkool> how do you mean? via bind?
[17:48:12] <StayInSkool> i'd be using .on( if possible
[17:48:25] <Jon47> right, set your scroll event handler to do something really simple, like just set a boolean value "scrollingHasOccured"
[17:48:55] <Jon47> and then have your function running on an interval to perform some action conditionally on whether the browser has been scrolled
[17:49:01] <teear> Scrollerbutstuck
[17:49:03] <StayInSkool> hey, that's genius
[17:49:09] <Jon47> i didn't come up with it :)
[17:49:23] <Jon47> http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/
[17:49:24] <StayInSkool> that's perfect. i could set the framerate exactly that way
[17:49:27] <StayInSkool> 3600/24
[17:49:32] <StayInSkool> fucking genius. thank you
[17:49:48] <Jon47> np
[17:49:59] <Jon47> i'm curiosu to see your project when you've got a prototype running
[17:50:04] <bindi> how can I reduce the headers with an ajax request?
[17:50:12] <teear> teh britest bulb in teh bulbstore
[17:50:15] <Jon47> bindi try asking the question in a different way
[17:50:23] <bindi> Jon47: reduce header size..?
[17:50:26] <bindi> <.<
[17:52:19] <Jon47> bindi that's something you gotta do on the webserver
[17:52:29] <bindi> no, request
[17:52:32] <bindi> client side
[17:53:07] <Jon47> your browser has a bit to do with what goes in the header
[17:53:12] <teear> Bindi is from Pohjanmaa stfu motherfucker
[17:53:15] <Jon47> what sorts of things are you trying to remove?
[17:53:53] <bindi> anything possible really, doesn't matter
[17:53:55] <Jon47> i'm fairly certain that jquery doesn't have permissions to fuck with the headers aside from the URL
[17:54:26] <Jon47> i guess the url isn't actually a header
[17:54:26] <teear> Bindi alkaa peellä loppuu aalla on hienoo olla pohjanmaalla
[17:54:41] <teear> Take it easy
[17:54:41] <bindi> teear: that's very interesting
[17:54:43] <Jon47> it's a security thing i think, and that's the way it should be
[17:54:57] <bindi> http://blog.mibbit.com/?p=143 i'm looking at this
[17:55:17] <bindi> i have no idea how this is supposed to work, i just slapped that in a file and put it inside a script tag
[17:55:24] <bindi> apparently safeSet() never fires
[17:55:56] <teear> yee cannot trust a blog with a frog
[17:56:17] <GAEfan> I have a DOM that contains an input field.  I want to remove that DOM without triggering the onchange event of the inout field.  Ideas?
[17:56:41] <astropirate> haha
[17:57:35] <bindi> can I use that with my $.ajax({url:'blahblah' ..?
[17:57:47] <Jon47> bindi you can try to run that when your app initializes
[17:57:52] <Jon47> i'm pretty surprised that it works
[17:58:03] <bindi> http://meteorserver.googlecode.com/svn-history/r61/trunk/public_html/poll.html I googled and it's supposed to be  used like this, apparently
[17:58:19] <Jon47> setHeaders()
[17:58:40] <bindi> bunch of TypeErrors
[17:59:25] <MysterOnyx> I know Jon47 helped me earlier, but does anyone have advice on how to get jquery event handlers to work on elements that have been added to the dom after document ready?
[17:59:34] <MysterOnyx> still struggling with it
[17:59:46] <indistinguished> MysterOnyx, Bind it to a parent element
[18:00:09] <bindi> Jon47: apparently I can change it with ajax settings, in beforeSend
[18:00:57] <Jon47> MysterOnyx:
[18:00:57] <Jon47> $elementThatExistsRightNow.on('click', '.class-of-some-elements-to-be-added-later', function(e){ /* do some stuff */ });
[18:01:21] <MysterOnyx> indistinguished I thought I was doing that. I have an empty div that's populated by ajax. However the data's that populated relies on jquery event handlers. In the ajax on success, I have it appending the div with the data
[18:01:39] <indistinguished> What Jon47 said :3
[18:02:18] <MysterOnyx> hmm
[18:02:47] <indistinguished> I had issues with it a few hours ago
[18:03:14] <Jon47> you'll never get this stuff if you don't understand the browser event model, event bubbling, adding event listeners, etc..
[18:03:31] <rodd> MysterOnyx What about $( document ).on( '.element', 'event', function() {
[18:04:39] <teear> i am hetero
[18:04:48] <Dr-Bombay> congrats
[18:04:48] <rodd> ?
[18:04:49] <MysterOnyx> rodd I'll try that
[18:05:11] <teear> ?
[18:05:45] <indistinguished> teear, How is babby formed?
[18:06:30] <teear> babby?
[18:07:19] <teear> You meen Baby or Beer or you just cannot understand what you mean?
[18:10:38] <teear> Stupid dumbfuckforestretardasswhippingshitholebastard
[18:10:58] <indistinguished> lol.
[18:11:02] <Blaster> hey can anyone tell me why the $('.deselect') doesnt get fired once I addClass('deselect') ? http://jsfiddle.net/euTWx/
[18:11:23] <Blaster> $('.deselect').click() that is
[18:11:23] <Dr-Bombay> are you SURE you're hetero?
[18:11:40] <teear> yep i'm sure
[18:12:49] <someprimetime> so this is what #jquery is like on the weekends. weird.
[18:13:08] <tw2113> full of people asking questions about jquery?
[18:13:20] <indistinguished> I would never have guessed.
[18:14:38] <Whirl3d_> indistinguished, guessed that jquery was like this on the weekends?
[18:14:48] <rodd> who stays @ home on a saturday night, in an irc channel?
[18:14:58] <tw2113> jQuery nerds?
[18:15:01] <rodd> only nerds
[18:15:08] <Whirl3d_> I'm at the bar, what are you talking about?
[18:15:09] <Whirl3d_> lol
[18:15:13] <rodd> and other crazies
[18:15:32] <someprimetime> Whirl3d_: is one of the fewer cooler people in here so he gets a pass
[18:15:39] <rodd> voyeurs
[18:15:55] <Whirl3d_> ;) thanks someprimetime...
[18:15:57] <Blaster> Someone tell me why the $('.deselect').click() event doesn't get fired after I addClass('deselect') to an element??? http://jsfiddle.net/euTWx/
[18:16:01] <teear> Shesalady
[18:16:39] <teear> hot buttocks
[18:17:01] <indistinguished> buttocks
[18:17:06] <indistinguished> so un-sexy.

[18:18:07] <gnarf> indistinguished: http://peenmeter.com
[18:18:24] <gnarf> don't try that first one
[18:18:29] <gnarf> it might not be what you expect ;)

[18:24:33] <tw2113> now you're re-eating
[18:40:36] <Murg|e>  http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/. Would anyone be able to help with the js/ajax code to save li order and the ul id the li resides under.
[18:47:52] <min|dvir|us> How do I make $.function?
[19:03:09] <Jon47> min|dvir|us: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring ??
[19:03:37] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, that tells me how to make $(selector).function,
[19:05:03] <Jon47> min|dvir|us: so what do you want to do instead?
[19:05:09] <min|dvir|us> $.function.
[19:05:25] <Jon47> it's javascript, you can just clobber whatever you want
[19:05:34] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, I want to know the best practice.
[19:05:43] <Jon47> i think the best practice is to write a plugin
[19:05:50] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, that doesn't solve the same problem.
[19:05:56] <min|dvir|us> $.ajax exists, for example.
[19:06:05] <Jon47> what are you trying to solve?
[19:06:11] <min|dvir|us> I want to make $.function.
[19:06:18] <Jon47> yeah i heard that three times
[19:06:24] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, stop making me repeat myself.
[19:06:55] <Jon47> if you can explain a little bit more what you're trying to do then the people here will have more info to use to help you
[19:07:08] <min|dvir|us> I explained all I can explain. If you don't know, you don't know, and that's fine.
[19:07:15] <Jon47> k
[19:07:36] <Jon47> the $.fn namespace exists for people to write plugins
[19:07:45] <min|dvir|us> I don't want to write a goddamn plugin, then.
[19:08:16] <Jon47> anything else, i think there's no guarantees that jquery core won't use that key in the future
[19:08:37] <min|dvir|us> That's fine, I'll name it something like $.superCrazyFunctionName.
[19:09:18] <Murg|e>  http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/. Anyone know how to save jq connected list orders to mysql.  I need the js/ajax code to save li order and the ul id the li resides under.
[19:09:20] <Jon47> can i ask why you want to write something in the jquery namespace but not make it a plugin?
[19:09:46] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, because it doesn't operate over elements, but requires jQuery.
[19:10:06] <min|dvir|us> Does anyone know the best practice to make $.function?
[19:10:28] <Jon47> i think the best practice in this case is to make your function a module and use a dependency based module loader like require.js
[19:10:40] <min|dvir|us> That doesn't solve my problem.
[19:10:52] <Whirl3d_> min|dvir|us, what are you trying to do?
[19:11:00] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, I want to make $.function.
[19:11:06] <Jon47> so far the only problem you've brought up is that your function requires jquery
[19:11:07] <Dr-Bombay> that doesn't make any sense
[19:11:08] <min|dvir|us> Not $(selector).function.
[19:11:16] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, $.ajax does.
[19:11:18] <Whirl3d_> if you won't be more specific, than how can you expect us to help
[19:11:39] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, I want to make $.ajax except $.superCrazyFunctionName.
[19:11:48] <Dr-Bombay> "I want to make $.function"  that doesn't make any sense as a sentence
[19:12:00] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, that's very helpful, thanks.
[19:12:05] <Whirl3d_> have you tried $.fuckedupIshouldndoit=function () {}
[19:12:15] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, is that best practice?
[19:12:26] <Whirl3d_> best practice is not to do what you are doing
[19:12:31] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, why?
[19:12:45] <Whirl3d_> because it messes up the jquery namespace
[19:12:45] <min|dvir|us> I'm sure other people do the same thing.
[19:12:52] <Whirl3d_> it allows for overlap and overriding
[19:12:53] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, so does $.fn!
[19:13:04] * tw2113 brings up the topic of a cliff
[19:13:06] <Whirl3d_> $.fn==$.rprototype
[19:13:20] <Whirl3d_> it's a shortcut way of getting the jquery ptototype
[19:13:24] <min|dvir|us> $.fn.val = function () { alert('Haha, overwrode $().val!'); };
[19:13:42] <Whirl3d_> also not best practice...se how that works
[19:14:00] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, overriding existing variables is obviously not best practice and also obviously not what I want.
[19:14:17] <min|dvir|us> But a PoC to show you that it's possible in plugin form too.
[19:14:22] <Whirl3d_> what do you want then. Why not just var func=function()
[19:14:28] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, I want $.function.
[19:14:30] <min|dvir|us> It's really simple.
[19:14:41] <min|dvir|us> And I want the best practice.
[19:14:42] <Whirl3d_> then write it dufus. I told you already
[19:14:55] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, I don't know what the best practice is, dufus.
[19:14:57] <Whirl3d_> $.functionname=funcction () {}
[19:15:14] <min|dvir|us> People shouldn't answer if they don't know the answer.
[19:15:18] <Whirl3d_> wow. are you retarded. YOu want to do something that is not advised...there is no best practices
[19:15:22] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, thanks for your help!
[19:15:28] <Whirl3d_> for things that you are specifically advised not to do
[19:15:33] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, by whom? You?
[19:15:38] <Whirl3d_> by jquery
[19:15:44] <Whirl3d_> by any developer
[19:15:59] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, you think your opinion is fact.
[19:16:00] <Whirl3d_> but if you want to do it, I told you how
[19:16:01] <tw2113> seasoned developer
[19:16:15] <tw2113> n00b developers may not know great practices yet
[19:16:30] * tw2113 admonishes himself for using that term
[19:16:32] <Whirl3d_> I'm not a seasoned developer and I can se alll over every doc that I read about extending jquery that it's not advised
[19:16:39] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, can you link me?
[19:16:47] <min|dvir|us> Obviously you have a lot of references you can point me to.
[19:16:52] <min|dvir|us> Since you're so convinced.
[19:16:52] <Whirl3d_> one sec
[19:17:20] <Whirl3d_> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[19:17:28] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, what should I Ctrl+F?
[19:18:04] <Whirl3d_> reasons not to extend the jquery namespace turned up that link as #1
[19:18:27] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, you should humble yourself.
[19:18:35] <min|dvir|us> You don't know half of what you think you know.
[19:18:58] <Whirl3d_> trust me. I don't know much and yet I know that
[19:19:01] <Whirl3d_> lol
[19:19:10] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, what is it you know again?
[19:19:15] <min|dvir|us> That I shouldn't extend the jQuery namespace?
[19:19:17] <min|dvir|us> How do you know that?
[19:19:54] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, like I said, you don't know half of what you think you know.
[19:20:08] <Dr-Bombay> if you're such a fucking know it all why are you in here asking questions?
[19:20:23] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, I don't want to be mislead by someone who thinks they know but don't.
[19:20:28] <min|dvir|us> I'd rather not get answered at all.
[19:20:50] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, feel free to ignore all the questions I ask.
[19:21:01] <Jon47> min|dvir|us: what environment are you working in?  just a typical client-side situation?
[19:21:06] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, yes.
[19:21:48] <Jon47> anything you write that want to be accessible to the window object is inherently going to mutable, it's just how js works, so you can clobber whatever functions you write
[19:22:00] <min|dvir|us> Of course.
[19:22:07] <min|dvir|us> I'm not worried about clobbering.
[19:22:30] <min|dvir|us> I just want to know best practice for defining $.function.
[19:23:08] <Jon47> jquery is a third party library, the convention is that you wouldn't modify it directly, but jquery does provide a plugin functionality for developers to take advantage of the selector engine and whatnot
[19:23:16] <Jon47> if you're only concerned about the jquery DEPENDENCY
[19:23:30] <Jon47> and dont' want to use the selector engine
[19:23:49] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, I'm sure there's a good reason, and when I have the opportunity, I want to be able to do it.
[19:23:49] <Jon47> then the best practice is to use a dependency-based module loader
[19:24:29] <Jon47> the best way to write $.function is to join the jquery project as a developer and suggest a new function
[19:24:43] <Jon47> otherwise, don't modify the library outside of the paradigm they've created for that (plugins)
[19:25:12] <Jon47> if you don't care about that, then just do what Whirl3d_ said, $.myCrazyFunc = function(){};
[19:25:36] <Whirl3d_> you can also use $.clone($) to create your own jquery clone that you can mess up all you want. But still there's not going to be a Best Practices outline for something that the devs don't want you to do...
[19:25:47] <min|dvir|us> Christ.
[19:25:48] <min|dvir|us> Are you a dev?
[19:25:49] <Jon47> as far as i know there is nothing more to say about it
[19:25:54] <min|dvir|us> How do you know what the devs want me to do?
[19:26:04] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, people would take you more seriously if you didn't fucking lie.
[19:26:16] <Whirl3d_> lol
[19:26:23] <Whirl3d_> shoky, are you around?
[19:26:57] <Whirl3d_> EvilTwin, Cork, systemfault?
[19:27:14] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, no matter what they say, you have no right to quote them without actually knowing what they think.
[19:27:31] <Whirl3d_> troll much? LOL
[19:27:39] <min|dvir|us> I'm trying to help you, buddy.
[19:28:01] <Jon47> Whirl3d_: thanks for informing us about the clone method, I didn't know about that one
[19:28:20] <Whirl3d_> It's a little overkill, but it works...
[19:28:30] <Jon47> i don't plan to ever use it but i appreciate the sharing of knowledge
[19:28:52] <Whirl3d_> ;) I just read the shit. No idea how to actually put it together LOL
[19:29:02] <min|dvir|us> Jon47, I feel the same way about $.function.
[19:29:03] <Murg|e>  http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/. How do I get ul and li id's for connected lists to ajax and save to mysql?
[19:29:33] <Whirl3d_> Murg|e, I don't know how jqueryUI handles the change in the order of li elements.
[19:29:55] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, if you don't know, don't answer.
[19:30:00] <Whirl3d_> Murg|e, if you know how to get the new order of the elements, I can maybe help you with the writing them to sql
[19:30:18] <Whirl3d_> or reading them from sql..
[19:33:04] <Murg|e> Whirld3d_, If I can figure that out I'll let you know. I can do a little php but terrible on the js.
[19:34:46] <Whirl3d_> the js is the esy part. You could probably just try it and see by using the $.makeArray method to convert the list of elements from a jquery collection to an array and then see if jquery ui uses the dom for the reordering. They might use data-variables...I'm just nto sure.
[19:36:00] <shoky> hy
[19:36:13] <shoky> what a long sleep.
[19:36:31] <Whirl3d_> shoky! Yeah!
[19:36:45] <shoky> hai dood
[19:37:03] <Murg|e> Whirl3d_, I've done alot of messing with the serialize.  I can get the order of a new list fine if I wanted to update the order of a specific UL.  But I can't figure out how to get the id of each UL so I can update to which UL the LI moved to.
[19:37:10] <tw2113> shoky moderate Whirl3d_ and min|dvir|us
[19:37:10] <Whirl3d_> Can you explain why it is inconsistent to ask for the best practices when writing a funciton that is not a plugin but uses $.function
[19:37:35] <teear> duud yeer way over yeer head
[19:37:38] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, a) You are trolling. b) It's long over.
[19:38:03] <tw2113> right
[19:38:41] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, what part is it you can't believe?
[19:38:55] <min|dvir|us> Nevermind, I'm sorry I asked.
[19:39:01] <teear> yeer heads gonna xplode yee don't understand any pagelayout
[19:39:05] <tw2113> both parts :)
[19:39:31] <tw2113> can is possible, do is not
[19:39:58] <min|dvir|us> Oh, that's what 'do' is, thanks.
[19:40:01] <shoky> umm. since it's not considered a best practice to do $.myfunction, then the best practice to do $.myfunction, is just to do $.myfunction = <.....>
[19:40:07] <shoky> i don't see what the issue is
[19:40:22] <Whirl3d_> that is EXACTLY what I said. lol
[19:40:22] <min|dvir|us> shoky, who says it's not best practice?
[19:40:37] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d_, doesn't matter, you didn't know but pretended like you did. :)
[19:40:42] <tw2113> "i can't believe" = possible
[19:40:51] <tw2113> "i don't believe" = not
[19:40:59] <shoky> min|dvir|us: i've seen jq devs say it, i don't remember if it was here, or i read it. but that's what i remember, i don't have any direct references for you, sorry
[19:41:12] <min|dvir|us> shoky, OK, I'll ask later.
[19:43:57] <shoky> sup besides that, ppl.
[19:44:14] <min|dvir|us> shoky, are you a dev?
[19:44:22] <shoky> no
[19:44:30] <Whirl3d_> same ol same ole... you slept all day? right on.
[19:44:40] <systemfault> Meh… I have work to do but I don't want to do it..
[19:44:46] <shoky> lawl yes. went to sleep at 15:00. woke up at 5:30am :D
[19:44:55] <tw2113> you lazy bum shoky
[19:44:59] <shoky> :(
[19:45:02] <min|dvir|us> shoky, do what everyone else does and drink a Red Bull.
[19:45:09] <min|dvir|us> That was for systemfault.
[19:45:14] <tw2113> meh, red bull
[19:45:17] <tw2113> coffee!
[19:45:20] <andrewhl> is there a way to add the pseudo-class :hover to an element using jquery? e.g.: if I rollover a div, it adds the :hover pseudo class to another element on the page. Or should I just add a .hover class?
[19:45:22] <shoky> i doubt everyone drinks red bull ;S
[19:45:38] <shoky> not that coffee is any better
[19:45:40] <min|dvir|us> Whatever your poison is.
[19:45:44] <shoky> mine is coca cola :(
[19:46:17] <min|dvir|us> Mine is illegal.
[19:46:31] <shoky> best things are
[19:46:43] <shoky> ill light up to that.
[19:46:57] * min|dvir|us nods and passes.
[19:47:06] <Whirl3d_> in the legal reference from the journal of american medicine, the "side effect" for caffeine take up 36 pages and include every kind of terrible behaviour imaginable. Crystal Meth: 8 pages. LOL I don't find either to be much of a problem...
[19:47:36] <shoky> meth before breakfast, yum
[19:47:44] <min|dvir|us> I don't get that much from caffeine.
[19:47:46] <Whirl3d_> lol
[19:49:13] <Murg|e> Whirld3d_, does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/1/
[19:57:34] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/KEBV3/7/
[19:58:34] <Whirl3d_> so it looks like you use the sortable plugin method to get the order by $(element).sortable("serialize",{key:elementid});
[19:59:04] <Whirl3d_> once it's a string, you append it the url of your php script that writes it to your sql database.
[19:59:56] <Whirl3d_> but you want the connectable's data...right?
[20:00:41] <Murg|e> Yes, I'm not sure how to ajax that output so that I can tell php here is the ul id, here is the li id, and this is the order they are in.
[20:02:58] <ajpiano> Murg|e: you don't have to use sortable's serialize method at all
[20:03:14] <ajpiano> you can just do any arbitrary method to create a data structure that you can use on the other side
[20:03:27] <Whirl3d_> hooray. Here's the answer for sure.
[20:06:40] <Murg|e> Sorry ajpiano, maybe i'm in over my head but i'm not sure what you mean or how to accomplish it.  I've just been piecing this together from various google results lol.
[20:09:48] <ajpiano> Murg|e: i mean that you can write code that will serialise the data you want into whatever format you want , like this
[20:09:49] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/8/
[20:10:31] <ajpiano> now the problem there is that update fires once for each list so you get it happening twice
[20:11:12] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: what was the question before?
[20:11:13] <attr> Hi all, is it possible to send a base64 encoded image via ajax without it getting truncated?
[20:11:27] <ajpiano> whether it's a good idea to put arbitrary functions on jQuery ?
[20:11:34] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, what is the best practices way to do $.function?
[20:11:35] <ajpiano> attr: presumably via post
[20:11:54] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: i'm not sure what you mean by "best practises way to do $.function"
[20:12:06] <min|dvir|us> 'practices'
[20:12:08] <min|dvir|us> :)
[20:12:16] <attr> ajpiano: unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work
[20:12:29] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, I want to add $.function like $.ajax.
[20:12:33] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: both are acceptable spellings, fwiw.
[20:12:57] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: generally it's frowned upon to store arbitrary utility methods for your application inside of $
[20:13:00] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, it was a joke, like you didn't understand what I meant because you thought I spelled it differently.
[20:13:28] <ajpiano> if you are distributing a plugin and want to store static constructors or whatever on jQuery, it's fine
[20:13:42] <ajpiano> but generally there are other places within your app to store things besides the top level jQuery namespace
[20:13:47] <ajpiano> oh.
[20:13:48] <ajpiano> ok.
[20:14:27] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, OK, that's reasonable.
[20:14:34] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, out of curiosity, are you a core dev?
[20:14:50] <ajpiano> i'm the devel relations lead for the project
[20:15:22] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, oh, cool. That explains why I see you so much. :)
[20:15:25] <ajpiano> :)
[20:21:28] <Murg|e> ajpiano, Thanks. As you've written it, could I put order in the $.ajax data: and post it to the php page to update the db?
[20:22:40] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, I can't believe you get paid to do this. So I can highlight you at any time and ask you a question?
[20:22:54] <ajpiano> whaat
[20:23:33] <ajpiano> what makes you think i'm paid to do this
[20:23:45] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, you said you're the developer relations lead.
[20:23:52] <min|dvir|us> Titles usually come with paychecks.
[20:24:05] <ajpiano> and dave methvin is the development lead
[20:24:08] <ajpiano> and foundation president
[20:24:19] <ajpiano> no one's getting paychecks :p
[20:24:25] <min|dvir|us> Who is appendTo()?
[20:24:42] <ajpiano> there are some projects that a few team members have worked on contractually
[20:24:51] <ajpiano> but nothing connected to having a particular title with a salary or aynthing
[20:25:12] <ajpiano> appendTo is an independent company that was started by a number of people who were active team members at the time they started the company
[20:25:30] <min|dvir|us> Doesn't appendTo own jQuery?
[20:25:41] <ajpiano> no
[20:26:03] <tw2113> some people contribute because they love the community
[20:26:03] <ajpiano> jQuery is owned by the jQuery Foundation
[20:26:15] <tw2113> ajpiano and jquery, me and wordpress
[20:26:28] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, one might get confused when a title is mentioned.
[20:26:35] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, but snark is always appreciated.
[20:26:42] <tw2113> what snark?
[20:26:46] <ajpiano> a bunch of the wordpress core devs have done a tonne to help out jquery in the last few months, actually
[20:26:50] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, I don't know, I assumed you were snarking because you did before.
[20:26:56] <min|dvir|us> My B.
[20:27:08] <ajpiano> totally awesome :)
[20:27:41] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, that's cool. Do you guys return the favor?
[20:28:05] <ajpiano> well, daryl's speaking at the next jqcon :)
[20:28:23] <tw2113> the koop?
[20:28:27] <ajpiano> THE KOOP INDEED
[20:30:36] <tw2113> ahhh communities
[21:12:37] <circlicious> is there any special way of doing JSONP in jquery?
[21:18:56] <LoneStar99> howdy have    --> <div id="abc"><div id="foo"></div></div> click event does not work for id="foo"
[21:20:56] <LoneStar99> is it because it is contained within another <div id>
[21:21:06] <shoky> LoneStar99 it works fine
[21:21:46] <shoky> if it doesn't, prove it (make a jsfiddle)
[21:22:19] <LoneStar99> shoky: ok should $('#foo').click(function () {  }); work?
[21:23:26] <shoky> that'd work just as well as:     if (true) ;
[21:23:47] <shoky> LoneStar99 yes.
[21:24:29] <LoneStar99> web console shows no errors...
[21:25:26] <shoky> something else must be wrong then ...
[21:25:34] <shoky> or you're clicking the wrong element ;P
[21:25:50] <LoneStar99> k
[21:28:39] <LoneStar99> shoky: i think i need to bind it some how -->  $('#foo').on('click', 'div', function(event){ }); ??
[21:30:56] <shoky> LoneStar99: cant help you without knowing what you are doing
[21:31:31] <shoky> LoneStar99: .click(...) is binding as well
[21:32:48] <LoneStar99> shoky ok let me jsfiddle...
[21:37:04] <LoneStar99> shoky it seems to be a binding issue works on div embedded in html, but not if on page requested from ajax
[21:38:12] <andrewhl> Can someone recommend an article on how to create an input[type="file"] button that loads the file select dialog and submits the form when the file is selected? In other words, building the submit button into the input "file" button.
[21:43:00] <min|dvir|us> LoneStar99, get the document object from the page requested from AJAX and use it like so: $('#foo', ajaxRequestedContent.document).click(eventHandler);
[21:44:12] <LoneStar99> min|dvir|us: ok thanks will try that out
[21:44:51] <Silne30> I am having some issues with jQuery UI dialog. If I just create a dialog without the autoOpen feature set to false, it opens fine when the page loads. But I want it to open
[21:44:57] <Silne30> after I click a button.
[21:45:29] <Silne30> Any reason why it works with autoOpen but not without?
[21:49:11] <shoky> Silne30: what doesn't work
[21:49:53] <Silne30> The dialog doesn't open.
[21:50:11] <Silne30> I am using it with ASP.NET AJAX
[21:50:44] <shoky> ?demo @ Silne30
[21:50:55] <shoky> bot-t, what's up
[21:51:10] <shoky> Silne30: make a demo of your issue in www.jsfiddle.net
[21:51:37] <shoky> Silne30: here's a fiddle with jqui & its css already included: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/
[21:51:56] <LoneStar99> shoky min|dvir|us the following works -->  $(document).on('click', 'div', function(event){  }); but can't use "document" cause clicking on any div will trigger a function...
[21:52:26] <shoky> LoneStar99: replace document with some static container element that will hold the stuff you want to click on
[21:52:44] <shoky> LoneStar99: and replace 'div' with a selector for the stuff you want to click on.. e.g.  '#foo'
[21:52:51] <min|dvir|us> LoneStar99, if you're adding the AJAX as HTML dynamically, then you can use $('#ajax-container').on('click', '#foo', callback);
[21:53:10] <min|dvir|us> $('#ajax-container').on performs better than $(document).on.
[21:54:03] <shoky> LoneStar99: and in case you're confused, me and min|dvir|us just said the exact same thing ;P
[21:54:23] <min|dvir|us> shoky, oh, I didn't read what you wrote.
[21:54:30] <shoky> min|dvir|us that's ok
[21:54:45] <tw2113> shoky says stuff?
[21:54:51] <shoky> THINGZ
[21:55:14] <min|dvir|us> shoky doesn't say 'stuff', he says 'THINGZ'.
[21:55:53] <LoneStar99> min|dvir|us: ok will try $('#ajax-container').on
[22:00:00] <Blaster> $var = 123 ? $foo = abc; echo '123' : echo '456';   Hey guys, is it not possible to set a variable and do an echo inside a ternary?  I'm getting an unexpected ';' error
[22:00:18] <MysterOnyx> AJAX returns some new divs that are rendered on the page. Each div has a unique ID, and a unique event will occur when each is clicked on. My question: how do I create a click event handler for each unique ID considering they are produced on the fly during run time?
[22:01:04] <LoneStar99> this worked -->  $(document).on('click', '#foo', function(event){ });
[22:01:32] <MysterOnyx> LoneStar99, you're talking to me, right?
[22:04:19] <MysterOnyx> nevermind I decided to just make a generic click function for a class, and then I'll assign the same class to each div.
[22:06:19] <LoneStar99> MysterOnyx:  i was talking to shoky and min|
[22:19:56] <prologic> http://code.google.com/p/gtv-ui-lib/ <-- I've come across this nice little library, Anyone familiar with it? Is there anything else out there like it?
[22:57:08] <b1lly> I am dynamically injecting an element into the DOM and than i want to run a fadeIn effect on it
[22:57:13] <b1lly> is there anyway to target that element?
[22:57:28] <b1lly> or to update the DOM so that i can target it
[22:57:50] <someprimetime> wait what?
[22:57:58] <someprimetime> $('#element').hide().fadeIn();
[23:00:06] <b1lly> im using .load()
[23:00:12] <b1lly> to dynamically navigate between pages
[23:00:18] <b1lly> and i want to add a transition
[23:00:43] <someprimetime> you are loading contents?
[23:00:53] <b1lly> yeah I guess?
[23:01:14] <someprimetime> attach a class to the new set of DOM elements that you are loading in from somewhere I assume it's an html fragment of some sort?
[23:01:28] <b1lly> its not a fragment its the full HTML
[23:01:31] <someprimetime> then just target that class like $('.js-new-contents').hide().fadeIn();
[23:01:45] <b1lly> I do that but the problem is that it shows the contents for a split second
[23:01:48] <someprimetime> so just prepend it somewhere
[23:01:49] <b1lly> hides it and than does the transition
[23:02:02] <someprimetime> well naturally you are going to have some latency
[23:02:08] <someprimetime> it's just the nature of loading things dynamically
[23:02:14] <someprimetime> you can do certain things to change it
[23:02:17] <b1lly> its on my local dev env
[23:02:22] <b1lly> the latency isnt the issue
[23:02:29] <someprimetime> well think of how it'll be on production then
[23:02:33] <b1lly> it literally pulls the new pages, SHOWS IT completly
[23:02:37] <b1lly> than hides it
[23:02:40] <b1lly> than fades in
[23:02:46] <someprimetime> so the fadein is @ 500 ms by default
[23:02:48] <someprimetime> change it to like 200
[23:02:52] <someprimetime> fadeIn(200)
[23:02:58] <b1lly> your not listing?
[23:03:00] <someprimetime> is that the issue? the fadeIn takes too long?
[23:03:06] <b1lly> no
[23:03:07] <someprimetime> i'm kinda high to be honest
[23:03:08] <b1lly> the issue is that
[23:03:15] <b1lly> it shows the full page
[23:03:18] <b1lly> for like a second or two
[23:03:20] <b1lly> and than hides it
[23:03:22] <b1lly> and than fade ins
[23:03:30] <b1lly> i dont want it to show the page and than hide
[23:03:33] <b1lly> i just want it to fade in
[23:03:45] <someprimetime> so set a timeout before the fade?
[23:03:54] <b1lly> wow...
[23:04:06] <someprimetime> you got an example?
[23:04:13] <someprimetime> jsfiddle of some sort of some actual code i can look at
[23:04:25] <someprimetime> hard to debug through english sentences you know
[23:07:25] <someprimetime> guess you raged
[23:08:24] <b1lly> no I got it
[23:08:36] <b1lly> one last question
[23:08:42] <b1lly> when I dynamically injecty
[23:08:46] <b1lly> an element
[23:08:53] <b1lly> the event listener doesnt work for that element
[23:17:46] <someprimetime> ? on @ b1lly
[23:17:46] <bot-t> b1lly, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:18:07] <someprimetime> you need to use that (it's the successor of live() which basically rebinds the event handlers)
[23:18:25] <b1lly> someprimetime: so just do $('body').on() ?
[23:21:01] <xboi209> anyone know why using jquery doesn't work in userscripts?
[23:22:31] <someprimetime> xboi209 you from stockton?
[23:22:42] <xboi209> yeah
[23:22:45] <someprimetime> and to answer your question i'm not even sure what userscripts is
[23:22:50] <xboi209> but answer my question plz
[23:22:52] <someprimetime> nice i grew up there
[23:22:55] <someprimetime> explain userscripts to me
[23:22:57] <someprimetime> and maybe i can help
[23:23:16] <xboi209> userscripts are basically ways for ppl like us to create scripts for specific websites using javascript
[23:23:28] <xboi209> it's supported by default in chrome and needs greasemonkey in firefox
[23:23:37] <someprimetime> oh @ b1lly $('submit').on('load', function() { // whatever });
[23:23:48] <someprimetime> basically bind it to your submit event
[23:25:09] <someprimetime> like reddit enhancement suite?
[23:35:06] <Gambit-> hoy chaps
[23:36:23] <Gambit-> has anyone used jqGrid with portlets?
[23:36:29] <shoky> holy chopsticks batman
[23:36:40] <Gambit-> Also, does anyone know of a portlet layout system that can save the layout to json and load it back in already pre-made?
[23:41:22] <LoneStar99> anyway onclick to scroll to bottom of page?
[23:42:39] <someprimetime> LoneStar99: target the height of the longest div on the page
[23:43:13] <someprimetime> then do like $('html, body').scrollTop($('#longest_div').height());
[23:43:35] <LoneStar99> someprimetime: ok let me try that
[23:43:37] <LoneStar99> thanks
[23:48:24] <someprimetime> LoneStar99 http://jsfiddle.net/rHrwP/
[23:49:49] <someprimetime> or you could use like $(document).scrollTop()
[23:50:01] <LoneStar99> someprimetime:  cool was just searcing for "jquery target div"...
[23:50:03] <someprimetime> alternatively replace scrollTop with animate for a nicer effect
[23:50:17] <LoneStar99> sweet
[23:50:38] <someprimetime> but animate takes parameters so ? animate @ LoneStar99
[23:50:43] <someprimetime> ? animate @ member:LoneStar99
[23:50:44] <bot-t> member:LoneStar99, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[23:51:43] <Whirl3d_> sorry this is off topic, but I just saw Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Slayer and it was absolutely astounding.. wow... sorry, just thought I would share. LOL
[23:52:51] <xboi209> can anyone tell me why this won't work?
[23:52:51] <xboi209> http://jsfiddle.net/yjXqT/3/
[23:53:09] <LoneStar99> someprimetime:  ok testing without animate first
[23:55:24] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d_: sweet
[23:57:17] <shoky> omg
[23:57:21] <shoky> you met abe?!?!?!??!?!?!?
[23:57:45] <shoky> im a big fan of his.
[23:58:03] <shoky> and now to google what you actually referenced.
[23:58:30] <shoky> sounds good i'm in.
[23:58:35] <StayInSkool> this channel is not too far from #reddit
[23:59:24] <Whirl3d_> I can't believe how great the movie was. It was one of the best 3D movies I have ever seen (and I have seen almost all of them)
