[00:14:56] <dddbmt> Hey guys. Anyone know where I can find the jquery.cycle.all.MIN.js? The one I can find on http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/download.html is not "minified"
[00:16:57] <dddbmt> nvm. found it at: https://github.com/malsup/cycle/downloads
[00:18:22] <Phil> dddbmt, there's a host of online tools to minify JS, if you're ever stuck again
[00:21:14] <dddbmt> Phil, thanks alot - I'll keep that one in mind! ;)

[00:25:49] <JamesTaylor> i hope, any help guys?
[00:26:24] <impi> hey guys, i am using this datepicker: http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/date_range_picker_using_jquery_ui_16_and_jquery_ui_css_framework/ and it all works fine, i would just like to know how to get the date that i have selected?
[00:27:12] <molavy> any idea?
[00:27:29] <impi> i have looked through the code and tried the following, but it doesnt work: http://pastebin.com/LHXZv74K

[00:39:10] <[1]bob> Hello, i'm trying to clean strings by removing characters such as { ( or " but it doesn't work, what am I doing wrong ?  arrayJsonValues[i]=arrayJsonValues[i].replace(/\+\{\(\"/g,"");
[00:43:39] <thyphus> [1]bob: try .replace(/[\+\{\(\"]/g,"");
[00:44:44] <[1]bob> it worked thanks :)
[00:44:56] <JamesTaylor> impi, so you just want to obtain the value of the date entered ?
[00:45:40] <thyphus> [1]bob: and you know why? :)
[00:47:03] <[1]bob> Yeah I think it's because [ ] means that you replace one of the characters inside no ?
[00:47:09] <thyphus> [1]bob /foobar/ match the string foobar, /[fobar]/ match every character of f, o, b, a and r
[00:47:41] <[1]bob> thanks a lot thyphus =)

[00:51:50] <JamesTaylor> impi, change to : $('#input').daterangepicker({ ...etc, then set the id to input, use getElementByID to retrieve?

[00:56:32] <kasunLak> hi all, is it possible to do a cross domain ajax call for a server not supporting JSONP?
[00:57:56] <Phil-Work> kasunLak, if you don't want a response, yes
[00:59:05] <kasunLak> Phil-Work: :-) no I want to use JSON feeds instead of JSONP to render my screen
[00:59:24] <impi> JamesTaylor, thanks for the hints, i was thinking along the same lines, just with jquery ui datepicker i could use something like: onSelect: function(date, picker) { var selecteddate = date;
[00:59:38] <Phil-Work> I assume that means you need a response
[00:59:46] <Phil-Work> how does the other server 'not support' JSONP?
[01:00:11] <impi> JamesTaylor, i use jquery tools tooltip for this, and it's quite nice, maybe check it out? you can then set a class thats hidden where you can grab the tooltip contents from
[01:00:27] <[1]bob> Hey guys, I've got an array with each value as a merged result of the key and element separed by a ',' (exemple array[0] = "key,value"). Is there a way to separate the key and value properly ?
[01:01:11] <kasunLak> Phil-Work: there is no JSONP support yet so I tried to find out a way to use JSON feeds
[01:01:21] <[1]bob> I've tried with map , returning value.split(','); but it doesn't work :o
[01:01:38] <Phil-Work> kasunLak, you don't have control over the remote server's response?
[01:01:45] <kasunLak> no
[01:01:57] <Phil-Work> kasunLak, you could consider a local proxy
[01:02:25] <Phil-Work> so you request local.com/feed.php and it makes a request to the remote and returns the response

[01:09:08] <[1]bob> wait i'll paste the json
[01:09:39] <toxz> what is better $(document.body)   or   $('body')   ?
[01:09:50] <aaronmcadam> body will do
[01:10:17] <toxz> is the first supported by all browsers?
[01:10:41] <aaronmcadam> should be it's only a property of document

[01:12:03] <aaronmcadam> clean it
[01:12:04] <aaronmcadam> ?
[01:12:25] <aaronmcadam> ah
[01:12:29] <aaronmcadam> parse it you mean

[01:17:25] <aaronmcadam> i'm not sure what u mean by "clean that string"
[01:17:30] <aaronmcadam> do u mean parse?
[01:18:26] <[1]bob> I mean removing the {( or " characters so that I can have in Array1 [0] the id and in Array2 [0] the value
[01:18:44] <aaronmcadam> you mean parse then

[02:13:17] <blup> based on the docs, jquery.tmpl should be used with appendTo, prependTo, insertBefore, or insertAfter.... is there a way of replacing a div's content instead?
[02:14:33] <Woet> blup: i'm not familiar with jquery.tmpl, but maybe .html(''); and then appendTo?
[02:14:43] <Woet> or just .html('Your content')
[02:15:44] <blup> Woet: why didn't i think of that? thanks :)
[02:16:08] <Woet> blup: i figured you thought of it and it was not possible to do that with jquery.tmpl
[02:16:13] <Woet> but seems i was wrong :p
[02:16:14] <B2011> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/Xk8YD/ however i do not know how to include the jquery file please have a look
[02:16:38] <blup> the second proposal is not appropriate, from what i see in the docs, but the first one should work
[02:16:42] <Woet> B2011: where is clearTimeout?
[02:17:26] <B2011> oops .. in a sec
[02:17:49] <Woet> B2011: and you can pick the framework on the left
[02:19:35] <B2011> Woet: not sure howto: but updated :
[02:19:37] <B2011> http://jsfiddle.net/Xk8YD/1/
[02:20:18] <Woet> B2011: that code makes you sense
[02:20:28] <Woet> you initiate a timeout and you clear it right after it?
[02:21:09] <B2011> in ctt (init a timeout) -->in dtt() i try to stop the ctt()
[02:21:21] <Woet> B2011: okay, then your code isn't correct
[02:21:27] <B2011> :D
[02:21:28] <Woet> surely you can see that yourself?
[02:21:51] <B2011> please help
[02:22:04] <B2011> i m really dummy about js
[02:22:50] <B2011> what i m doing is to animate title , then stop the title animation
[02:22:54] <Woet> B2011: just read http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp
[02:23:57] <B2011> i see. ok thanks .i know how to fix
[02:25:41] <poppiez> how can you check whether the browser supports 3d transforms?
[02:27:12] <timing> I just read http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_Woet.asp
[02:28:23] <IamTrying> In Opera how can i join/concat empty space? This does not work e.g a = a.concat(value);  where value = " ";
[02:30:28] <Haprog> concat() concatenates arrays..
[02:30:38] <Haprog> not strings
[02:30:59] <IamTrying> Haprog, other browsers works not opera
[02:31:19] <Woet> timing: don't have such a silly nick then :P
[02:31:22] <Haprog> why don't you just use a = a+value
[02:32:27] <IamTrying> Haprog, a = 1+1 is 2 not "11"
[02:32:27] <timing> :-)
[02:32:50] <Haprog> IamTrying: a = '1'+'1' is '11'
[02:32:59] <Haprog> why would you use integers
[02:33:11] <ussher_> use parseInt(a)  + 1
[02:33:57] <seutje> I suspect a script in my page to brutally asplode any inline styles on the body element by simply setting document.body.style instead of appending/replacing, what would be the easiest way to find out which script this is
[02:34:13] <seutje> please don't say stepping through everything, monitoring the body styles
[02:34:24] <Haprog> + is the way to concatenate strings. you just make sure you don't accidentally have integers where you don't want them. or force them to strings first.
[02:35:28] <Haprog> IamTrying: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/strings.html#conc
[02:35:42] <quicksilver> just put a string first if you're worried it might be a number
[02:35:45] <quicksilver> ?eval '' + 1
[02:35:46] <bot-t> quicksilver: "1"

[02:36:48] <Haprog> ?eval '' +(1+1)
[02:36:49] <bot-t> Haprog: "2"
[02:38:19] <quicksilver> this ugly trick works in java too IIRC
[02:38:36] <quicksilver> of course, both languages are really broken trying to use + for string concat but there it is ;)

[02:43:42] <Haprog> are you sure the object "this" is what you expect in your context?
[02:43:51] <Myx0x3> http://pastebin.com/T1xc7DxZ i have an button with "onClick(changesauce())" the php stuff might be wrong, made an replica of my code fast.. why does it dont work?!
[02:43:54] <IamTrying> Haprog, yes 100%
[02:44:46] <Trollster> mwaahaha
[02:44:46] <Myx0x3> btw, the div has: hidden:none; in css
[02:44:52] <Trollster> I'mmmmmm baaa ahhhhck!

[02:45:45] <Trollster> please don't ban me because I don't want to be banned for doing somethign that I did not know was wrong but would like to know what I did if I did something wrong so I can avoid being banned for doing something that I did not know I was not suppose to do in order to avoid being banned for doing something that I did not know was wrong
[02:46:26] <smik`````> Ban him for that
[02:48:29] <Haprog> IamTrying: seems like a problem in opera then. I dunno.
[02:53:05] <BlaDe^> if I have $('.folder') which returns say, 6 items. how can I .join their .attr('id')'s to get #id1,#id2#,#id4,.....
[02:53:22] <BlaDe^> i'm sure there's an elegant solution
[02:53:36] <sodapop_> how can i convert back the output of serializeArray
[02:58:16] <timing> BlaDe^: var ids = []; $('.folder').each(function(i, el){ ids.push('#' + e.getAttribute('id'));  }); console.log(ids.join());
[02:58:26] <Haprog> BlaDe^: $('.folder').map(function() { return this.id }).get().join(',');
[02:58:32] <timing> BlaDe^: o it's el.getAttribute
[02:58:38] <timing> this and his code is shorter
[02:58:48] <timing> *shit
[02:58:57] <Haprog> :P
[02:59:08] <Haprog> not 100% sure that is right but I think so
[02:59:10] <Haprog> try it
[02:59:32] <Haprog> there's a similar example for .map() http://jqapi.com/#p=map
[02:59:40] <timing> Haprog: it says 'this' refers to the window object?
[02:59:44] <BlaDe^> that's a nice solution, Haprog :D
[02:59:50] <timing> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[03:00:16] <juria_roberts> why isn't this working?
[03:00:17] <juria_roberts> $('ul#list li:first').children()[1].hide()
[03:00:33] <juria_roberts> it gives an error saying hide is not a function
[03:00:37] <Haprog> timing: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[03:01:00] <timing> huh
[03:01:07] <timing> what is the difference between the two?
[03:01:43] <Haprog> timing: jQuery.map() or $.map() works differently to $('something').map().
[03:02:03] <Haprog> I think $.map() should be thought of like a static method
[03:02:14] <BlaDe^> Haprog would I need to join it with ,# ?
[03:02:14] <timing> ah ok
[03:02:19] <BlaDe^> .id doesn't return the #, right?
[03:02:31] <timing> BlaDe^: add the # in the return
[03:02:37] <BlaDe^> ah yeah good point, thakns
[03:02:42] <Haprog> BlaDe^: yes you need to add # yourself if you want it
[03:02:51] <Haprog> and add # to the beginning also for the first id
[03:03:01] <Haprog> yeah or the return :P
[03:03:06] <timing> the return is teh best
[03:03:13] <juria_roberts> heyy please help me as well
[03:03:16] <timing> BlaDe^: what are you doing with the resulting string?
[03:03:21] <timing> haha
[03:03:23] <mazzachre> Hi, the .data function, is that fine to use? I am thinking about circular dependency and memory cleanup here... Is it fine to store stuff with .data on elements that are "volatile" (removed and added all the time)? Or should I just use it to store stuff on elements that are static?
[03:03:33] <JamesTaylor> Hi all, i'm trying to use a simple tooltip to display the dynamic content of rows in a table, there are a number of rows all with "notes", i need a way to display the dynamic content of : 1. a hidden div with text OR 2. a url that will get/return the "notes text" , i can only think of very bad ways to do with i.e setting up loads of difference instances of the same tooltip. i'm missing something
[03:03:33] <JamesTaylor> i hope, any help guys?
[03:04:17] <timing> juria_roberts: this is not a jquery object: $('ul#list li:first').children()[1]
[03:04:45] <Haprog> mazzachre: I don't think it matters much, but I'm not an expert on that. Just try it out.
[03:04:46] <juria_roberts> timing: how do I get the second child as a jquery object?
[03:05:06] <timing> $('ul#list li:first').children().eq(1).hide() ?? i think
[03:05:18] <timing> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:05:21] <aaronmcadam> yes, eq(1) is the way forward
[03:06:24] <Haprog> timing: why not just $('ul#list li:first :eq(1)')
[03:06:42] <aaronmcadam> the actual functions are faster
[03:06:44] <Haprog> wouldn't that be the same?
[03:07:01] <juria_roberts> timing: thanks mate ur timing cudnt be any better
[03:11:45] <nooblette> is there any way of submitting files via JQuery's 'post' function?
[03:12:34] <Featurefreak> hi guys, getting an error when i try to detach a <pre> element
[03:12:34] <Featurefreak> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/436882/
[03:12:45] <Featurefreak> i've noted line 90 in a comment
[03:12:51] <Featurefreak> why is this happening?
[03:13:36] <Featurefreak> it's also weird, when i ctrl+r refresh the page, i get no error, but if i just hit enter on the url in the address bar, i get the error.... i'm stumped
[03:14:38] <nooblette> its noob hour 24/7 on #jquery
[03:14:44] <nooblette> anyone actually work for jquery here?
[03:14:54] <Hopsy> lol Noeble
[03:14:57] <Hopsy> nooblette: *
[03:16:05] <Featurefreak> I think J.R is the only person employed specifically to work on jquery, is there other employees?
[03:18:26] <nooblette> how do jquery upload plugins work then?
[03:18:35] <nooblette> *if not via ajax/post
[03:19:19] <Featurefreak> flash
[03:20:20] <Featurefreak> or som ekinda iframe trick
[03:20:27] <nooblette> I am in awe of how much this blows
[03:20:29] <Featurefreak> try http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[03:20:39] <nooblette> yeah, just looking at that now
[03:21:04] <Featurefreak> it's a javascript limitation, not a jquery fault
[03:21:34] <nooblette> ive tried uploadify and ajaxfileuploader, all plugins are overcomplicated. theres very little room for customization/integration
[03:21:55] <nooblette> yes, but its a sad state of affairs
[03:21:59] <Featurefreak> or rather an xmlhttprequest object limitation, or is it just an artifact of file input access security limitations?
[03:22:09] <intellilogic> Does Jquery have anything like, before I try to get someone to help me code it:  http://rhaydenenterprises.com/outsource/ajaxfunction.php
[03:22:18] <Featurefreak> nooblette, there's plenty of support for customizatoin, you just haveto really learn how  to use your callbacks
[03:23:14] <nooblette> i dont see why i need to learn and adapt to someone else's set of classes just to upload a file.
[03:23:29] <nooblette> there must be a simple option
[03:24:10] <Featurefreak> nooblette, you can write your own plugin if you not happy with the options out there
[03:24:28] <nooblette> using flash :/
[03:24:52] <Featurefreak> no, i think i was hastey to say that,  iframe tricks seems to be what people are using.
[03:24:52] <Featurefreak> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[03:25:45] <nooblette> iframes aren't good practice. I'll stop my whining and settle on a plugin :(
[03:25:56] <Featurefreak> intellilogic, is this a method for doing a xmlhttprequest for passing a multi select list selection over to php? and handling the response?
[03:26:43] <Featurefreak> intellilogic, in which case yes, jqueyr has really really simple well developed wayys to do this/. .;
[03:26:53] <Featurefreak> that was a lot of punctuation :P
[03:27:01] <intellilogic> Yes, but I want to mage it a broad generic method for any form elements over to PHP w/o having to write any JS just for that form
[03:27:44] <Featurefreak> intellilogic, yes, you use submit event handlesrs to check if the form has such elements. in it.
[03:27:59] <Hopsy> lol
[03:28:00] <Hopsy> http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell
[03:28:14] <nooblette> love theoatmeal
[03:28:25] <Myx0x3> why does not this work?! http://jsfiddle.net/6MTxT/
[03:28:33] <pranny> So, I have a jQuery code somewhere that is generating GET request. Despite my best efforts, I am finding it dificult to figure out which one. Any ideas on how to trace which function is causing the GET request?
[03:28:38] <intellilogic> My goal is to spin off a new form and not have to write any JS for it.  Just onchange or onclick='AjaxFunc()' and it sends all the info to PHP and PHP sorts it out
[03:29:04] <pranny> Is it possible to create a listener on GET requests, so that everytime a get request is generated, i can see which function or from where is this request generated?
[03:29:13] <nooblette> Myx0x3, use fadeTo
[03:29:29] <intellilogic> pranny:  firebug
[03:29:59] <Myx0x3> sorry, wrong link nooblette.. this is the correct now: http://jsfiddle.net/6MTxT/2/
[03:30:36] <pranny> intellilogic: I have done breakpoints in FireBug but still i am unable to trace it out. There are many document.ready hooks inserted. So, I added a breakpoint on every such place, and before the first document.ready triggers, the call goes
[03:31:05] <nooblette> Myx0x3, again, use fadeTo: http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[03:33:14] <solidus-river> how come no matter what i do this code results in a GET ajax response...
[03:33:35] <solidus-river> one sec, paste bining
[03:34:57] <supster> can anyone think of a way to write a selector that match elements *without* a certain attribute? e.g., <select>s without the `multiple` attribute?
[03:35:21] <solidus-river> https://gist.github.com/f442f653a3d575b9123b
[03:35:24] <supster> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#attribute-selectors makes me think it's not possible - but maybe i am missing something
[03:35:38] <solidus-river> no matter what in my browser log it shows that as getting sent as a GET request, not a POST request
[03:38:32] <solidus-river> anyone on that ajax? its driving me insane
[03:39:47] <supster> solidus-river: you have an extra `"` on line 4?
[03:40:01] <supster> note the broken syntax highlighting on gist
[03:40:26] <supster> should be throwing you a SyntaxError though ...
[03:40:44] <aaairc> does putting a "$" in front of your variable name signify anything in jQuery?
[03:40:54] <solidus-river> supster: yeah sorry that was my error in copying from code and pasting,
[03:41:02] <solidus-river> aaairc:  $ === jQuery
[03:41:14] <solidus-river> $.ajax === jQuery.ajax
[03:41:39] <supster> aaairc: some people (me) like to use it as a convention to signify the variable represends a jquery object (as opposed to a dom object or something else)
[03:41:45] <aaairc> like is there any difference between doing var $event = $("#event")  and   var event = $("#event")
[03:42:04] <supster> no. just a name
[03:42:06] <Hopsy> no
[03:42:10] <aaairc> ok thanks
[03:42:21] <aaairc> wanted to make sure it wasn't changing the scope of it or anything
[03:42:22] <aaairc> thanks
[03:42:42] <supster> solidus-river: pasting your code directly (and fixing the extra `"`) results in a POST request for me
[03:42:47] <supster> so something else is wrong
[03:42:54] <Hopsy> but i recommend to use var evet, aaairc
[03:43:04] <Hopsy> event *
[03:43:35] <aaairc> so as not to confuse it with anything?
[03:43:46] <solidus-river> supster: one sec, let me hard code this request in
[03:43:56] <Hopsy> yeah, and there is no need to?
[03:44:00] <solidus-river> supster: ok, here is the code
[03:44:17] <aaairc> i've been doing $name ... when the name represents a jQuery wrapped object like $("#event")
[03:44:23] <aaairc> as the variable name
[03:44:30] <AdvoWork> im adding events to a select by doing: options[options.length] = new Option(array['caltype']);  how can i add another option after that, but to the first select position OR how can i add an option anywhere, and make it selected?
[03:45:27] <solidus-river> supster: this is the actual code, it results in sending a GET request to /api/user :? why, shouldn't it send a POST to /api/user with the post array being equivalent to the json in data?
[03:45:36] <solidus-river> supster: https://gist.github.com/2aa88c6536cd30b53f43
[03:46:07] <supster> AdvoWork: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[03:46:18] <supster> you're looking for Array#push and Array#unshift
[03:46:51] <supster> e.g., `options.push(...)` to add to the end and `options.unshift(...)` to add to the beginning
[03:47:46] <supster> solidus-river: still results in a POST for me ...
[03:48:09] <supster> does your console.log show that type is "POST" for you?
[03:48:54] <solidus-river> supster: yeah, but my chromium javascript console log says GET /api/user
[03:49:15] <solidus-river> supster: and my application is responding wtih a code that only comes from the GET handler of that route
[03:49:38] <supster> something is broken then, set a breakpoint on the $.ajax call and step into it and examine
[03:49:52] <aaairc> does it matter if your functions go within the $(document).read() or not? when I look at examples, half the time i see them put at the end after the document ready and the other half of the time i see them placed inside it
[03:49:56] <aaairc> is there a rule of thumb?
[03:53:07] <solidus-river> supster ok i'm stepping through it
[03:53:12] <solidus-river> supster: what should i be looking for?
[03:56:24] <supster> solidus-river: well first make sure that the options parameter you're passing to $.ajax
[03:56:35] <supster> is an object that contains the property "type" with the value "POST"
[03:56:58] <supster> i have a feeling it is not
[03:57:22] <solidus-river> how do i test that
[03:57:27] <solidus-river> i'm on the line $.ajax(request);
[03:57:36] <solidus-river> sorry, i've never really done extensive javascript coding before
[03:57:45] <supster> are you using chrome dev tools?
[03:58:00] <solidus-river> supster: yep
[03:58:21] <supster> on the right panel there is a section named "Scope Variables"
[03:58:33] <supster> look for the request object there and examine it
[03:58:37] <solidus-river> oh, i see it, it is an object and it has a field type : "POST"
[03:59:14] <supster> step into the $.ajax call then
[03:59:25] <supster> and see what's going on
[03:59:41] <solidus-river> supster: and thats wehre i get lost, i dont know jquery enough to keep track of all the scope variables or what its doing
[03:59:57] <solidus-river> supster: i remember from last time there was a  loop that seemed to go on forever though
[04:00:13] <supster> use a non-minified version so the variable names make some sense
[04:00:23] <solidus-river> supster: i am :\
[04:00:24] <supster> and do your best
[04:00:39] <solidus-river> so it gets that url is an object, makes options the url and makes the url undefined
[04:00:39] <aaairc> does it even matter? it seems to me like it doesn't matter where i throw my functions... just as long as i'm calling them within the document.ready
[04:00:46] <aaairc> would people agree with that?
[04:01:00] <AdvoWork> supster, like options.unshift(new Option("Choose Event")); ?
[04:02:01] <supster> aaairc: it depends. what if your function needs to close on a variable that's only in scope in your dom.ready handler?
[04:02:45] <supster> AdvoWork: yes
[04:03:00] <supster> solidus-river: sounds correct so far, keep going
[04:03:10] <aaairc> supster:  yeah if its a variable that needs to be closed that isn't passed. if you pass the variable to the function anyways it wouldn't matter then right?
[04:03:23] <supster> solidus-river: do you have a link i can look at?
[04:03:24] <solidus-river> ok, its extending the default ajaxRequest with my object
[04:03:32] <solidus-river> supster: haha, yeah that would be easier
[04:03:44] <solidus-river> supster
[04:03:47] <solidus-river> http://www.comunall.com/console
[04:04:00] <solidus-river> clicking send runs the code i posted, i took out all the dynamic parts utnill i find out whats going on
[04:04:01] <supster> aaairc: that is correct. but there are other cases too where you might want the function defined in your current scope
[04:04:01] <aaairc> what if you function doesn't need access like that... is it better practice then to leave it outside the document ready or should i just throw everything in there? is there any reason not to throw it into the document ready?
[04:04:34] <supster> aaairc: i like outside
[04:04:52] <aaairc> supster: just because it keeps your document ready looking cleaner?
[04:05:29] <supster> aaairc: because the functions i'm defining probably have nothing to do with dom.ready and don't even know what it is
[04:05:45] <supster> might as well keep them seperated. so yes ... looking cleaner
[04:05:55] <aaairc> supster: ok makes sense. thanks
[04:05:59] <BlaDe^> Does anyone use JScrollPane ?
[04:07:05] <Lion31> http://paste.debian.net/122677/   <-  my binding and unbinding live events for my app... but it is not working... the unbinding part :(
[04:07:31] <supster> solidus-river: wow ... there's nothing really going on here. kind of boggling that it is not working. taking a look now
[04:09:44] <solidus-river> supster: aye, thanks, i'm gonna keep stepping through it on my end, it scombining the default ajaxRequest with the object i passed in
[04:09:45] <tolborg> How do I bind a anchor tag to fire a keypress if clicked?
[04:09:50] <solidus-river> supster: with a deep copy
[04:10:15] <tolborg> how should the keypress event be used in this case?
[04:12:44] <AdvoWork> supster, that doesnt do anything :s no errors either
[04:13:09] <Lion31> Ok, got it...in the die documentation there is a comment that explains everything... the die selector should be EAXCTLY the same as live selectr... so in my case I should use $('a.appcontent, a.appclassifieds, a.appad').die("click.app_events");
[04:13:14] <AdvoWork> supster, code:
[04:13:16] <AdvoWork> http://pastebin.com/uxhbifZdhttp://pastebin.com/uxhbifZd
[04:14:20] <supster> solidus-river: it is sending  POST to the server
[04:14:28] <supster> the server is responding with a 301
[04:14:33] <supster> which results the client to follow up with a GET
[04:14:48] <supster> for some (dumb) reason chrome is not showing that initial POST ...
[04:15:13] <supster> i looked at the headers
[04:15:17] <solidus-river> supster: GAAHHH, >.<, i should install firefox to dev
[04:15:26] <supster> there is definitely a: POST /api/user HTTP/1.1
[04:15:44] <solidus-river> supster: does the data get transferred with the correct pairings?
[04:15:51] <Trudko> Guys I want  to find all a href children  and transfor them to spans, I am thinking about using parent.find('a') not sure about changing spans
[04:15:54] <solidus-river> 301 would make sense as a response
[04:15:57] <Trudko> changing to spans
[04:16:02] <supster> pairings?
[04:16:32] <solidus-river> wait, no it wouldn't, i never send a 301...
[04:17:07] <Trudko> So how would you change this link to span http://jsfiddle.net/wCkqE/
[04:17:28] <Trudko> and lets saz there are more than one links(i should added that to code)
[04:18:53] <supster> definitely getting a 301 with Location: http://www.comunall.com/api/user/
[04:19:00] <supster> (same url as the POST)
[04:19:08] <supster> at least you know your problem is on the server :)
[04:19:17] <solidus-river> odd, what would cause a 301
[04:19:19] <solidus-river> its curl time
[04:21:06] <supster> AdvoWork: i'm not familiar with the .attr("options") ... not sure that works as you expect
[04:21:24] <supster> even if it did, you would want to re-set the attribute at the end with .attr("options", options)
[04:21:33] <supster> but you should look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/170986/what-is-the-best-way-to-add-options-to-a-select-from-an-array-with-jquery
[04:22:19] <Trudko> guys how to change this links to spans if you only know id of parent.
[04:23:07] <Haprog> Trudko: I'm working on it.
[04:23:18] <Trudko> Haprog thank you a lot
[04:23:23] <Haprog> I haven't done too much with jQuery but trying that out :)
[04:25:25] <supster> Trudko: you can't change the element like that, you will have to rebuild a new element, remove the old one, and insert the new one in place
[04:26:25] <PrinceES> loading a video inside the banner(big image frame).. after someone will click on the link wouldnt work at all....  please have a look http://samirayousefi.com/slider/ :(
[04:26:25] <Haprog> Trudko: here http://jsfiddle.net/wCkqE/2/
[04:26:59] <solidus-river> that is extermely bizarre, wow everything in that route responds with a 301
[04:31:44] <solidus-river> pro-tip, never EVER use a php framework :\
[04:32:08] <ElGoorf> http://pastebin.com/YvgcPbRr -  slight issue trying to use an array as data in an ajax request anyone care to enlighten me?
[04:32:10] <sodapop_> i have a string of the form "/var,value/var,value" i want to split with
[04:32:26] <sodapop_> \ but it creates empty elements
[04:32:41] <sodapop_> sorry "/"
[04:33:54] <Trudko> Haprog:  hmm so zou use before to add new element and . removed deleted old one?
[04:34:05] <Haprog> yes
[04:34:25] <Trudko> it confuse me a little that you sued remove right after does before returns object?
[04:35:19] <Haprog> just basic chaining you see all the time with jquery. you could also do $(this).remove(); but it's more code
[04:35:47] <Haprog> you're working with the same object
[04:37:07] <Haprog> like most jQuery methods. before() also returns the same jQuery object back
[04:37:10] <Haprog> to allow chaining
[04:49:01] <AdvoWork> im doing: options[options.length] = new Option(array['staff_firstname'] + " " + array['staff_surname']);  how can i set the id of that option also?
[04:49:07] <cerzi> hi all, im looking for some advice - I'm generating a variable number of ajax forms on a page using jinja2 - each form has its own submit button. when a submit is clicked, only that form data is sent using a callback function. considering the elements of the form are named along the lines of "form_1_input1", "form_1_input_2" etc, and the number of forms/inputs varies,
[04:49:12] <cerzi> is there a neat way to write the callback function?
[04:49:54] <cerzi> as opposed to generating callback scripts for every single form
[04:50:59] <equivoc> AdvoWork: var o = new Option(...); o.setAttribute('id', 'its_id'); options.push(o);
[04:56:52] <DroMastaP> Hi everybody

[05:14:50] <rahmen> Hi! I'm having some trouble with a jsonp ajax call where I want to wait for the call to get the results and then return it: http://pastie.org/2201636 How can I achieve this? jsonp doesn't allow async: false
[05:23:27] <cerzi> using the jquery.form plugin, how can I make the output element (set in the options) vary depending on which form on the page was submitted?
[05:26:58] <Patatouf> hi ! I would like to know what would be the best practice to execute an action from an ajax link but not expecting any "response" from the server ?
[05:28:18] <equivoc> just don't provide a callback
[05:28:24] <equivoc> or an empty callback
[05:29:13] <equivoc> $.post('fire-and-forget.php');
[05:29:30] <Patatouf> ah ok
[05:29:32] <Patatouf> thx equivoc
[05:31:16] <DroMastaP`Fr> plz guys, what's wrong with that ajax call ? ( my first time )
[05:31:17] <DroMastaP`Fr> http://jsfiddle.net/7w4ut/
[05:36:00] <equivoc> DroMastaP`Fr: check with firefox' firebug or chromium's webtools whether the request is even being sent and what return code you receive
[05:36:47] <antaranian> hi ladies
[05:37:18] <DroMastaP`Fr> I just solved my problem, I missed a "}"... aptana studio don't said to me......
[05:37:50] <antaranian> guys, are there any tools/apps which you use to write documentation to your application ?
[05:38:21] <antaranian> I'm not about API reference, but more about the guide with examples, etc.. ?
[05:38:45] <DroMastaP`Fr> but thanks you equivoc :)
[05:47:28] <Protomega> Okay so I left my office with a working form button clicky thing.. And now it's not working.. I put up alerts everywhere and none of the alerts pop up at all
[05:48:00] <dr0id> go back to office thn
[05:48:34] <misterm> yes clearly the problem is geographical
[05:49:37] <Protomega> Is there anything wierd that may cause this to happen?
[05:49:38] <misterm> Protomega: just fyi, alerts are not a debugging tool...get yourself set up with something like Firebug or the webkit developer tools and your life will be much easier
[05:49:48] <Protomega> I have firebug
[05:49:52] <Protomega> And I'm running it
[05:49:56] <Protomega> And there are no errors, nothing.
[05:50:41] <misterm> Protomega: there's a practically endless number of things that could cause it
[05:51:26] <misterm> If you're looking for help with it, your best bet is to post a test case on jsfiddle, pastebin, etc
[05:52:43] <[1]bob> Guys, i was wondering what's the difference between $('ul > li') and $('ul li') ??
[05:53:07] <[1]bob> can't find anything about the ">" on google :o
[05:53:11] <kojiro> [1]bob: ul li will match any li that is a decendent
[05:53:20] <misterm> [1]bob: http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[05:53:23] <kojiro> [1]bob: ul>li will only match the li if it is a direct child
[05:53:44] <[1]bob> How interesting thanks to both of you
[05:54:11] <James-> hello
[05:54:13] <Protomega> http://pastebin.com/bdc6i9RN
[05:54:35] <James-> i have question, after i have body onload="init()"   , in jquery how do that ?
[05:54:40] <juria_roberts> heyy how can I change the name of an element if the select box below it is selected?
[05:55:19] <Protomega> You mean the name attribute of an element?
[05:55:22] <juria_roberts> damn
[05:55:35] <juria_roberts> Protomega: yeah
[05:55:43] <juria_roberts> also i meant checkbox
[05:55:52] <juria_roberts> not select box
[05:56:05] <misterm> James-: if you pass a function to $ it will be run on document ready
[05:56:15] <misterm> so, $(init)
[05:57:08] <misterm> Protomega: so which parts of this are not working?
[05:57:50] <Protomega> WHen I press the add part button which is on line 198
[05:57:55] <James-> misterm as it http://pastie.org/2201777 ?
[05:58:01] <Heliodor> Hi, i need to compare rel and value attributes on each input field, and if they are the same, add a checked attribute. Ive tried googling but can't find anything.
[05:58:11] <juria_roberts> heyyy please help me 2
[05:58:21] <DroMastaP`Fr> is that possible in an ajax call : data: "prenom="+ prenom +"&ville="+ ville,
[05:58:22] <DroMastaP`Fr> ?
[05:58:41] <misterm> James-: no, you pass the name of the function you want to run, or the function itself
[05:58:46] <DroMastaP`Fr> to send thooses datas to a php file
[05:59:01] <aaairc> can you do count++ in jQuery
[05:59:01] <misterm> Protomega: wheres the relevant JS code?
[05:59:10] <James-> hum can you show me plz ,
[05:59:14] <aaairc> so the "++" instead of count = count +1?
[05:59:16] <Protomega> juria_roberts, I'm thinking simply http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[05:59:28] <misterm> aaairc: jQuery === JavaScript
[05:59:48] <Protomega> Lines 12 - 102
[05:59:49] <aaairc> ok, let me rephrase... can you do a count++ in JavaScript?
[06:00:12] <misterm> James-: if you have a function called "init": $(init); will cause it to run on ready
[06:00:18] <aaairc> misterm: ^
[06:00:32] <misterm> James-: or you can do $(function(){ //stuff you want to do })
[06:00:45] <James-> i try that
[06:00:50] <juria_roberts> Protomega: how do i get the element above checkbox?
[06:01:01] <misterm> aaairc: Yes, you can do variable++ or ++variable ...though some people don't consider it a good idea
[06:01:22] <cerzi> in the success function of a jquery.form ajaxform, how can I access elements that were inside the submitted form? as in, if I wanted to change the text within a textbox of the form that was submitted (on a page with multiple forms)
[06:01:40] <Heliodor> Hi, i need to compare rel and value attributes on each input field, and if they are the same, add a checked attribute. Ive tried googling but can't find anything.
[06:01:43] <Protomega> juria_roberts, you could do a document.getElementsByName("Name here")
[06:01:43] <misterm> Protomega: what happens if you put   $("button#addPart") in the console?
[06:01:53] <Protomega> Hmm let's find out
[06:01:56] <halcyon1234> @Heliodor:  try the .filter function
[06:02:29] <Protomega> [button#addPart]
[06:02:32] <Protomega> That's the result.
[06:02:40] <aaairc> misterm: thank you
[06:02:47] <misterm> aaairc: np
[06:03:18] <Heliodor> halcyon1234: thanks, that should work
[06:03:19] <misterm> aaairc: just to be clear, those two examples I gave do slightly different things btw
[06:04:10] <aaairc> ok cool
[06:04:41] <aaairc> i think i'll just avoid them for now. after you said some say its bad practice found an article where they were saying it could introduce security vulnerabilities down the line.
[06:05:32] <misterm> security vulberabilities? I don't know about that...it's just harder to read and follow
[06:06:03] <Protomega> From what I can see, it should work misterm.
[06:06:18] <misterm> Protomega: what do you see?
[06:06:45] <Protomega> Everything seems connected cofrrectly, and I can't seem to find any missing ends.
[06:06:57] <misterm> Protomega: did you try using the console?
[06:07:15] <Protomega> I'm not sure what exactly to do in the console but I did what you said and "[button#addPart]" came up.
[06:07:41] <misterm> Protomega: I'd spend a little time reading firebug tutorials and such
[06:07:50] <misterm> it will help a lot in this situation and any others like it
[06:08:02] <Protomega> Will do.
[06:08:06] <seutje> firebug introduces bugs! \o/
[06:08:22] <Protomega> Do you have a prefered read or just any read should do?
[06:08:33] <misterm> Protomega: but as to the immediate problem, it seems like you've got an error somewhere, it won't neccesarily show up in firebug
[06:09:01] <misterm> Protomega: so I'd start trying to track down/reduce the problem....start taking things out until you get something that works
[06:09:02] <Lomex> How can I select the first parent form tag of as forms child?
[06:09:07] <Lomex> a*
[06:09:42] <misterm> Protomega: process of elimination, try just attaching a click handler...see if that works...then add a little bit more...etc
[06:10:10] <misterm> Protomega: sorry, I can't reccomend anything off the top of my head...I'm sure there's an official tutorial but I dunno how good it is
[06:12:05] <Protomega> Strange... I took everything but the click event handler out
[06:12:09] <Protomega> And it still won't work.
[06:13:44] <Lomex> How can I find the first parent of $(this) being a form?
[06:14:07] <Protomega> Hmm, is there a reason why javascript wouldn't load maybe?
[06:15:08] <misterm> Protomega: I doubt it, you can test it by putting a console.log line in to make sure the script runs period
[06:15:19] <Protomega> Yea it's not running at all
[06:15:21] <Protomega> I just tried it
[06:16:46] <misterm> You'll have to check what your PHP is actually serving
[06:18:05] <geal> hello
[06:19:01] <DroMastaP`Fr> if ($("#prenom").val().lenght = 0))     << Doesn't work, what have I to use ? :x
[06:19:03] <bot-t> DroMastaP`Fr, x | jQuery Plugins - You can use this plugin to automatically add a small "X" to each input field to remove the current value by clicking or touching the X. You may know this function from the iPhone Safari URL bar. Re... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/x
[06:20:26] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: you spelled length wrong and it should be ==. You can also just test  if ($("#prenom").val().length) since 0 will resolve to false and >0 resolves to true
[06:21:04] <DroMastaP`Fr>  if ($("#prenom").val().length) return 0 if empty ?
[06:21:15] <geal> I'm fighting with a weird bug: $('<div id="aaa">blah</div>').find('#aaa') doesn't find anything. I understand that there's a workaround for that (I found some code in sizzle.js:1175), but I don't know how I should use it, or if there is a regression. Could someone shed some light on this, please?
[06:21:30] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: actually looking closer, just do  if ($("#prenom").length)
[06:21:41] <Protomega> How do I check that misterm? Sorry for being so daft.
[06:21:47] <DroMastaP`Fr> :D
[06:21:54] <DroMastaP`Fr> gonna try, 1 min
[06:22:08] <misterm> Protomega: view source, amongst other things
[06:22:10] <b1lly> if I had something like <div id="element1"></div><div id="element2"></div> <div id="test"></div>        and I wanted to move "test" between element1 and element2 what function would you use?
[06:22:20] <misterm> Protomega: what did you use to check if the JS is being run?
[06:22:37] <Protomega> I just did a console.log("Javascript Ran");
[06:22:42] <Heliodor> halcyon1234: I got stuck on how to use .filter :-S
[06:22:46] <Protomega> And I did that on the home page and it worked.
[06:22:48] <misterm> Protomega: where did you pit it?
[06:22:51] <misterm> *put
[06:23:05] <Protomega> Right under <script>
[06:23:09] <kborchers> ?insertAfter @ b1lly
[06:23:09] <bot-t> b1lly, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[06:24:03] <Protomega> Does it matter that the pages are being loaded via Ajax?
[06:24:20] <kborchers> b1lly: so $("#test").insertAfter("#element1") will move it
[06:24:27] <misterm> Protomega: depends on what you mean
[06:25:16] <Protomega> Well the page is using tabs from the jQueryUI, and the pages are loaded via the ajaxOptions of the tab thing.
[06:25:36] <DroMastaP`Fr> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/ymcbJr2P
[06:25:51] <mekwall> $("#element1").after("#test");
[06:25:57] <mekwall> less code :)
[06:26:03] <DroMastaP`Fr> still not working, it's all times a succes
[06:26:43] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: you need ! and length is still spelled wrong - if (!$("#prenom").length) {
[06:26:44] <thinkster> I am trying to use image overlay from jquery tools (http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/index.html) but for some reason, when I add the startup in my script ( $("img[rel]").overlay();
[06:27:12] <thinkster> I am trying to use image overlay from jquery tools (http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/index.html) but for some reason, when I add the startup in my script ( $("img[rel]").overlay();), my jcart ajax functionality breaks
[06:27:31] <tiemonster> I have a draggable set to clone, and a droppable that fires the drop event, but the element doesn't drop. Am I missing something? http://pastie.org/2201888
[06:27:49] <Protomega> I guess I'll just save the code and then start retyping it and see if I can get it working
[06:27:49] <DroMastaP`Fr> kborchers: now, it's always an alert xD
[06:28:29] <mekwall> tiemonster: what do you mean it doesn't drop?
[06:28:50] <tiemonster> mekwall: shouldn't the clone object stay on the drop zone when it's dropped?
[06:28:57] <tiemonster> *cloned
[06:29:01] <misterm> Protomega: yea, that could matter...dynamically inserted script tags schould work though
[06:29:09] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: then your selector is not finding an element with id of prenom
[06:29:21] <Protomega> Well I just deleted everything (Backed it up) and did a console.log and it worked.
[06:29:30] <Protomega> So it must have been something within the code
[06:29:46] <misterm> Protomega: the Tabs degrade to links to the page right? what happens if you open it just as a page rather than within the tab?
[06:30:11] <misterm> Protomega: ok
[06:30:22] <DroMastaP`Fr> kborchers: he's existing :/ if you want to look at my full code : http://pastebin.com/Q4QR4G3K
[06:30:31] <Protomega> misterm, I guess now would be a good time to just make my code reusable :P
[06:30:47] <misterm> ha, yea
[06:31:18] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: please pay attention this time. you are still spelling length wrong
[06:31:20] <Protomega> Maybe I should do some reading though because when it gets into doing this like $(this).parent.. and what not I just get totally lost
[06:31:21] <Kambfhase> DroMastaP`Fr: $("#prenom").lenght << did you mean length?
[06:31:26] <misterm> lol
[06:31:30] <halcyon1234> @heliodor:  $("stuff").filter(function()  { if ( some conditions with $(this) ) { return true; } } );
[06:31:53] <DroMastaP`Fr> shit.... i'm sorry, i'm french, I don't understood the first time :(
[06:32:03] <DroMastaP`Fr> i'm really sorry ^^
[06:32:23] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: no problem, maybe copy/paste next time ;)
[06:32:34] <DroMastaP`Fr> :)
[06:33:53] <DroMastaP`Fr> still not working :((
[06:34:04] <DroMastaP`Fr> I don't understand
[06:34:13] <DroMastaP`Fr> always true or always false
[06:34:54] <misterm> DroMastaP`Fr: what are you trying to check?
[06:35:04] <Kambfhase> not working is not a valid problem description
[06:35:14] <DroMastaP`Fr> if something is written in my text label :)
[06:35:25] <CuDi> yo
[06:35:26] <DroMastaP`Fr> but now it's work, but with if (!$("#prenom").val().length) {
[06:35:28] <CuDi> where my homies at
[06:35:31] <CuDi> coldhead
[06:35:37] <CuDi> jam master j
[06:35:46] <DroMastaP`Fr> without ".val()", it doesn't work :/
[06:35:46] <Kambfhase> CuDi: try #ghetto
[06:35:56] <Kambfhase> ;)
[06:36:00] <Protomega> misterm, do you have any recommended reads? I ask because last time I was writing the code I had to constantly retry things like (this).parents("...").. etc. because I couldn't figure out how it was finding things.
[06:36:00] <misterm> DroMastaP`Fr: that's not what !$("#prenom").length checks
[06:36:01] <CuDi> kambfhase try http://automate.uni.cc
[06:36:11] <DroMastaP`Fr> ok
[06:36:12] <kborchers> DroMastaP`Fr: sorry, that's my mistake. I thought you were testing the existence of the element. What you want is if (!$("#prenom").val().length)
[06:36:38] <Heliodor> Hi, i need to compare rel and value attributes on each input field, and if they are the same, add a checked attribute. Ive found the filter function, but don't know how to make it work.
[06:36:57] <kborchers> DroMasteP`Fr: or if ($("#prenom").val() != "")
[06:37:00] <DroMastaP`Fr> what I want if my condition is true ??
[06:37:01] <slartsa> it appears to be rather challenging to get html-code from dynamically created elements. Might it be easier to push details of those dynamically created elements into an array while creating them so they could be fetched from this array?
[06:37:05] <misterm> Protomega: sorry, recommended reads for what?
[06:37:19] <DroMastaP`Fr> :)
[06:37:29] <DroMastaP`Fr> nice solution too I thins
[06:37:31] <DroMastaP`Fr> think
[06:37:32] <misterm> Protomega: for jQuery you mean?
[06:37:33] <mekwall> tiemonster: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LNWfs/
[06:37:50] <Protomega> misterm, I think for JavaScript in general probably.
[06:37:51] <mekwall> tiemonster: when using helpers you have to place the draggable yourself
[06:38:18] <misterm> Protomega: for JS in general check out Eloquent Javascript, for jQuery check out jQuery Fundamentals
[06:38:36] <DroMastaP`Fr> kborchers: this one work great too : if ($("#prenom").val() == "") {
[06:38:38] <geal_> hello, could anyone indicate how I can select my div in this type of request: $('<div id="aaa">blah</div>').find('#aaa')? (context: I'm getting some html with ajax, and I can't select top level elements by id)
[06:38:41] <AdvoWork> equivoc, here still?
[06:38:46] <misterm> Protomega: I can't personally vouch for either, I learned both so long ago I don't even remember how I learned...but I hear they are good
[06:38:48] <Kambfhase> CuDi: totally awesome!
[06:39:07] <Protomega> Well anything is better than nothing. :)
[06:39:11] <tiemonster> mekwall: um, ok. so I have to create a new element to append?
[06:39:20] <mekwall> tiemonster: no?
[06:39:21] <Kambfhase> geal_: try .filter() instead of .find()
[06:39:21] <CuDi> thanks buddy
[06:39:21] <CuDi> any freelancers here
[06:39:34] <tiemonster> mekwall: because I want it in both places
[06:39:36] <mekwall> tiemonster: check the drop event handler that I added
[06:39:46] <mekwall> tiemonster: ah ok
[06:39:58] <geal_> Kambfhase: thank you! it works :)
[06:40:04] <Kambfhase> :)
[06:41:15] <AdvoWork> if im doing: $.each(data, function(index, array) { options[options.length] = new Option(array['staff_firstname']);}) how can i also dynamically add an id to that?
[06:43:47] <mekwall> tiemonster: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LNWfs/4/
[06:45:20] <tiemonster> mekwall: cool. thanks.
[06:46:24] <Andy-> if I have 5 <div></div>, and one of them is assigned to var foo
[06:46:41] <Andy-> is there a way to find which div foo is
[06:46:47] <Andy-> i.e. 1st,3rd etc

[06:48:28] <Myx0x3> how do i add javascript strings in jquery code?
[06:48:43] <Myx0x3> +stringname+ dont work

[06:49:12] <Myx0x3> lastest?
[06:49:13] <Kambfhase> Myx0x3: hmm, paste you code please.
[06:49:13] <Brammm> Hi guys
[06:49:32] <AdvoWork> if im doing: $.each(data, function(index, array) { options[options.length] = new Option(array['staff_firstname']);}) how can i also dynamically add an id to that?
[06:49:42] <Andy-> thanks Kambfhase :)
[06:49:52] <Myx0x3> Kambfhase: http://pastebin.com/KjfzJvG9 +massage+ is my js string i want
[06:50:00] <Brammm> I'm using a custom jquery plugin (tokenInput) and would like to overwrite a few default settings. The docs there don't say anything about this, but is this possible? I feel like overwriting the defaults in jquery.tokeninput.js is a bit "wrong".
[06:50:16] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: $.each(data, function(index, array) { var f00=new Option(array['staff_firstname']);f00.id="f00"; options[options.length] = f00;})
[06:51:34] <Kambfhase> Myx0x3: you need to close the string, add yours, and reopen: http://pastebin.com/XkEy39a9
[06:51:56] <Myx0x3> aha.. it was that simple :>
[06:52:31] <Kambfhase> Brammm: if it is just you using that file I'd say "why not?"
[06:53:32] <Brammm> Kambfhase: yeah, but that would mean I have to update the file if we ever upgrade to a newer version, though this one works, so I doubt we ever will
[06:54:25] <misterm> Brammm: you can't monkey-patch it?
[06:54:31] <Brammm> monkey patch?
[06:54:44] <misterm> Brammm: like are the settings exposed at run-time
[06:55:31] <misterm> Brammm: for example if your plugin works like: $("#something").plugin()
[06:55:34] <Brammm> misterm: my plugin development knowledge is pretty limited. I see (function($) { var DEFAULT SETTIGNS...  on top of the file
[06:55:37] <Kambfhase> no, the Settings are only visible from within the plugin scope
[06:55:54] <Brammm> I think so yeah, i don't see them in the scope of the tokeninput plugin
[06:55:56] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, thanks!!
[06:55:58] <Kambfhase> or the defaults, atleast
[06:56:10] <misterm> Brammm: you might be able to do $.fn.plugin.props.blah = "foo"; $("#something").plugin()
[06:56:38] <misterm> Brammm: ah, well yea in that case basically just patch the plugin directly
[06:57:27] <Brammm> I was afraid I had to do that, but it's a bit of a hack job
[06:57:45] <pigdude> i have a page where when a some html is dynamically loaded, window.$ becomes undefined and jQuery is a different object from the jQuery object that is present when the page loads, with none of the extensions to its prototype (jQuery.fn) existing
[06:57:48] <Brammm> Part of the JS is generated through php, I wanted to put the defaults in an external js
[06:58:21] <Brammm> Meh, I'll just patch the original file, thanks for the input though!
[06:59:43] <pigdude> [what might cause that?]
[07:00:16] <Kambfhase> is you page live?
[07:00:33] <pigdude> Kambfhase: yes
[07:00:37] <misterm> pigdude: the html is overwriting window.$? it's hard to say on a vague description
[07:00:38] <Kambfhase> link?
[07:00:53] <pigdude> here is the script http://services.govexec.com/wp/dart/nj
[07:01:02] <pigdude> it writes some json_encoded html
[07:01:25] <rahmen> Doesn't form.submit receive button type="submit" values? I get everything else but the value from the submitbutton...?
[07:01:46] <Kambfhase> using document.write() kills everything in the page so far and creates a new one.
[07:02:06] <pigdude> Kambfhase: no it doesn't
[07:02:25] <pigdude> Kambfhase: that is only the case when it is called after the page is loaded
[07:02:27] <misterm> It depends
[07:02:29] <misterm> yeah
[07:02:51] <sahilsk_> hi, i got a problem. Can anyone give me a solution of how to make a element scroll down as i scroll down the page so that element is always visible to the user.With position:fixed , it obscure the top content and if i add more pixels in TOP value i can't see the element as my screen size is smaller.
[07:04:06] <pigdude> sahilsk_: this is a drawback of using that sort of styling, and i wish more web designers understood how it subtly breaks scrolling interface
[07:04:43] <sahilsk_> pigdude: any suggestion you have??
[07:05:05] <rahmen> http://pastie.org/2202048
[07:05:10] <sahilsk_> http://reapbenefit.org/waste_calculator.php , in this page i want  "co2 emission" element always visible as user goes on entering form value
[07:05:20] <sahilsk_> http://reapbenefit.org/waste_calculator.php , in this page i want  "co2 emission" element always visible as user goes on entering form value . pigdude
[07:06:02] <pigdude> here is the live url, we just set one up that does not display intermittently: http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/common-sense
[07:06:18] <pigdude> you can see that jQuery.prototype is clobbered, error: $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").prettyPhoto is not a function
[07:07:31] <pigdude> sahilsk_: listen on window scroll event and reposition your element accordingly
[07:07:57] <pigdude> sahilsk_: if clientTop is less than the top of the viewport, add the delta to top position
[07:08:19] <pigdude> sahilsk_: sorry that my advice is not jQuery-specific, i just know javascript and DOM
[07:09:01] <sahilsk_> that will do. thanks pigdude . one  more thing...your nick is funny. :P
[07:09:06] <misterm> pigdude: can you give more context? where is the error occuring...in the dynamically inserted code or elsewhere, when, etc
[07:09:29] <pigdude> misterm: the error occurs in ordinary page JS code that depends on function added to jQuery.prototype
[07:09:55] <pigdude> misterm: i thought it might be some strange noConflict() sort of thing, but it makes no sense that both window.$ and window.jQuery are clobbered
[07:10:04] <misterm> yea, some sort of plugin? when is the plugin added?
[07:10:19] <misterm> and how does the dynamically inserted stuff come into the picture?
[07:10:38] <kborchers> rahmen: i don't think button elements are considered "successful controls" and thus are not serialized. see ?serialize
[07:10:38] <bot-t> rahmen, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:10:42] <pigdude> misterm: it is added via some nested document.write()s, which seem to do their job just fine
[07:10:55] <pigdude> misterm: is there a property on global jQuery object that shows version?
[07:11:22] <pigdude> misterm: perhaps i could see if some part of this dynamically inserted HTML is somehow replacing the main jQuery object
[07:11:40] <pigdude> misterm: which it seems to be doing, but i could then refer to something with that version number
[07:13:23] <misterm> pigdude: yea it's something like $.jquery iirc
[07:13:56] <pigdude> misterm: 1.4.2 is present but <head> loads 1.4.4
[07:13:59] <pigdude> misterm: ok, thanks
[07:14:29] <misterm> pigdude: np
[07:15:57] <thinkster> I have a problem.  I am using jcart for basket/cart system.  And I have a bunch of images for my products.  I wish to make those images clickable and overlay larger version.  Problem is anytime, I add $('some-selector').overlay(), to my script, jcart's ajax features break.  So is there another way for me to do this, I was thinking of some php and scripting pages on the fly, but it will be messy?
[07:16:14] <melusinechan> hello
[07:16:45] <misterm> hi
[07:16:49] <melusinechan> i'm using the jquery ui dialog function and it event "close" inside an object
[07:17:11] <thinkster> Maybe I could change the function name of fancybox or jquerytools overlay to overlay1() ?
[07:17:16] <melusinechan> and i'd like to do somehing like this:   $( "#dialog" ).dialog({
[07:17:16] <melusinechan>     close: function(event, ui){
[07:17:16] <melusinechan>       debugger;
[07:17:16] <melusinechan>       this.busy=false;
[07:17:16] <melusinechan>     }
[07:17:17] <melusinechan>   }).
[07:17:31] <melusinechan> (oops sorry for the flood, i should have pasted that)
[07:17:40] <Kambfhase> yes you should
[07:17:56] <thinkster> nope, overlay1() doesn't work either
[07:18:19] <melusinechan> https://gist.github.com/1078071
[07:19:03] <misterm> thinkster: how do the ajax features break?
[07:19:35] <misterm> thinkster: have you checked the docs for the plugin/the plugins website?
[07:19:55] <thinkster> misterm, actually I think the problem isn't overlay() specific.  But anyway, the page refreshed when I add to cart, and the div that show total talley of items and charges disappears
[07:20:39] <melusinechan> Is there anyway to access "this"  using the callack of the event close : https://gist.github.com/1078071 ?
[07:21:26] <melusinechan> ("this being the object containing the function that use the dialog function + it callback close")
[07:22:24] <kborchers> melusinechan: try $(this)
[07:23:08] <melusinechan> kborchers: it returns me a div
[07:23:31] <melusinechan> i'd like to get the object
[07:23:35] <misterm> melusinechan: whait what object?
[07:23:46] <misterm> melusinechan: is the object you want in the code sample you gave?
[07:23:48] <melusinechan> ok let me clarify, sorry it super difficult to explain that for me ^^
[07:24:10] <misterm> melusinechan: the thing is "this" is determined by HOW a function is called
[07:24:53] <misterm> melusinechan: since jQuery will call your close function in the context of the element, you'll basically just have to save a reference to whatever object you want and use that to access it inside the function
[07:25:20] <misterm> melusinechan: you might have to use a closure, depends on what object you're talking about
[07:25:34] <kborchers> melusinechan: this refers to the div that the dialog uses and $(this) just turns that div into a jQuery object. what other this is there that you want to reference? there isn't one in your code sample
[07:25:34] <melusinechan> ok this should be more clear : https://gist.github.com/1078071
[07:26:03] <melusinechan> i'd like to access the instance Scene from the callback event
[07:26:07] <melusinechan> "close"
[07:26:20] <misterm> melusinechan: ok yea
[07:26:36] <misterm> melusinechan: before you make the call to dialog, save a reference to "this"
[07:26:41] <misterm> and use that to access the object
[07:27:07] <misterm> under this.busy = true, do something like var scene_ob = this;
[07:27:22] <misterm> then inside your callback do scene_ob.busy = false
[07:27:42] <melusinechan> misterm: i'll try, thx :)
[07:28:30] <seutje> melusinechan: http://pastebin.com/wU6JXJ91
[07:29:21] <melusinechan> misterm: working :_
[07:29:24] <melusinechan> :)
[07:29:28] <melusinechan> is that dirty ?
[07:30:01] <melusinechan> seutje: thx to you also :P
[07:30:05] <thinkster> can a div have a rel attribute?
[07:30:25] <melusinechan> thinkster: in semantic web it's possible
[07:30:28] <misterm> melusinechan: no, that's essentially what you have to do...what you've hit is a common point of confusion for people new to JS
[07:30:44] <thinkster> wtf is semantic web?
[07:31:02] <melusinechan> thinkster: check wikipedia ><
[07:31:06] <systemfault> thinkster: Something some retards created.

[07:31:12] <systemfault> Not worth checking.
[07:31:15] <melusinechan> systemfault: lolol
[07:31:29] <systemfault> People can't even write semantic markup...
[07:31:34] <miketaylr> seutje: OMG I QUITTING MY JOB HOOKE ME UP
[07:31:36] <misterm> as a retard I resemble that remark
[07:31:43] <miketaylr> also, i can't spell. :/
[07:31:45] <seutje> miketaylr: I WAS FIRST DAMN YOU
[07:31:45] <systemfault> We're a loooooonnnng way from a semantic web.
[07:31:57] <juha___> .remove() ?
[07:32:10] <juha___> ugh
[07:32:13] <tiemonster> Why is my draggable only visible on its parent element? Is this a z-index issue?
[07:32:14] <seutje> ?remove @ juha___
[07:32:15] <bot-t> juha___, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[07:32:18] <melusinechan> systemfault:  this is semantic web just a bad one :P
[07:32:29] <systemfault> :/
[07:32:35] <melusinechan> systemfault: rdfa is coming :P
[07:32:38] <miketaylr> lol @ "some retards" aka TimBL
[07:32:40] <juha___> my irssi was reading backlog from yesterday or something
[07:32:50] <juha___> so nevermind anything i've possibly said today
[07:32:50] <juha___> :D
[07:32:57] <misterm> sure, blame it on irssi
[07:32:57] <systemfault> miketaylr: I'm having a bad tuesday :P
[07:33:03] <miketaylr> it's cool haha
[07:33:27] <melusinechan> misterm: by the way thank you, and you're right i'm new to js :P
[07:33:53] <misterm> melusinechan: np
[07:34:57] <melusinechan> systemfault: if computer school begin to teach rdfa, it would be a good semantic web
[07:35:07] <melusinechan> and it's not that different from actual html
[07:35:25] <melusinechan> it actually give more sense to html :P
[07:36:05] <melusinechan> systemfault: but we have a bit of semantic using <meta> tags
[07:36:15] <systemfault> melusinechan: Just take a look at most of the markup in CMSes :(
[07:36:15] <juha___> conspiracy on uncle sam memorial statue, it was unveiled september 11 1976, think about that
[07:36:50] <melusinechan> systemfault: i'm not good with acronyms, CMS = Content Manager Systems ?
[07:36:58] <systemfault> melusinechan: Right.
[07:37:16] <melusinechan> CMS(???e????)s ?
[07:37:20] <melusinechan> :P
[07:37:23] <systemfault> :P
[07:37:41] <melusinechan> yeah we need to sensibilize those noobs developers
[07:37:49] <systemfault> I'm not the best to pluralize acronyms.
[07:38:01] <melusinechan> lololol
[07:38:04] <melusinechan> :P
[07:38:31] <misterm> Yea, like I was telling this guy at the ATM machine about the HTTP protocol
[07:39:41] <Kambfhase> HTTP? real web hackers use ICMP!
[07:40:06] <melusinechan> misterm: does CMS(e)s dev astray HTTP protocol ?
[07:40:50] <misterm> lol
[07:42:53] <systemfault> My guess is that CMS creators are backend devs...
[07:43:01] <systemfault> So they don't know anything about frontend.
[07:43:09] <systemfault> (And probably don't even care)
[07:44:22] <melusinechan> systemfault: i don't know about thos bad practice, i'm doing ruby and python for 4 years, people seem to read documentation and manuals there
[07:50:38] <ansimation> alright i had all of this working fine with jquery 1.4 but now that i'm using 1.6 ( WordPress upgraded to it ) it's telling me that $ is not a function and i cant figure out how to shut it up ;/
[07:50:44] <ansimation> http://173.168.172.225/broome_crosby/
[07:51:05] <CaptainQuirk> Hi,
[07:51:32] <CaptainQuirk> I would like to preload some html content through an ajax call before the dom is loaded
[07:51:55] <CaptainQuirk> I 've put it in a function before the usual $(document.ready)
[07:52:43] <CaptainQuirk> I get the content allright, but now I would like it to be parseable or subjected to a usual dom query to select just the part of the content I want to be displayed
[07:53:14] <CaptainQuirk> And I would like to be sure that the html content is loaded when I do something with it
[07:53:42] <CaptainQuirk> I don't know what kind of technique I should use
[07:55:06] <diamonds> is this pointful?   $(this).data('offsetY', parseInt($(this).attr('data-offsetY')));
[07:55:12] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: sounds like if you need all of that to happen before the DOM is loaded, you should do it server side.
[07:55:34] <diamonds> I thought data('offsetY') would already get attr('data-offsetY')
[07:55:40] <diamonds> it says (here) http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/12/behind-the-scenes-of-nike-better-world/
[07:55:56] <misterm> ansimation: when is it telling you that?
[07:56:09] <pickels_> How can I find out what caused a click event inside the click function. Tried e.target.className but doesn't seem to work in chrome.
[07:56:24] <ansimation> misterm, when you click a page in the nav
[07:56:34] <ansimation> it should slide and animate to it
[07:56:34] <diamonds> that it's to cache the value; does jQuery in fact store it in JS memory when you use data()?
[07:56:53] <Kambfhase> pickels_: try `this`
[07:56:59] <ansimation> it tells me $ is not a function and then under that says (6 out of range 4)
[07:57:07] <ansimation> whatever that means
[07:57:17] <diamonds> also, couldn't I just write $(this).data('speed', parseInt($(this).data('speed'); ?
[07:57:29] <diamonds> with more parens, of course
[07:57:45] <pickels_> Kambfhase, haha how silly of me. Thanks a lot ^^
[07:58:14] <misterm> ansimation: it looks like some sort of noConflict() problem
[07:58:43] <misterm> ansimation: the rest of the code uses jQuery(), but the line that throws the error uses $, which doesn't exist on the page
[07:59:23] <phlp> diamonds: data('offsetY') will get data-offset-y attr. dont use capital letters for the attribute
[07:59:57] <ansimation> misterm, yeah i been lookin for that for a little bit now. i just found it though
[08:00:06] <diamonds> phlp: is it beneficial to run $(this).data('offsetY', parseInt($(this).attr('data-offsetY')));
[08:00:08] <ansimation> the individual pages have a bit of js in them, thats causing it. thanks!
[08:00:11] <diamonds>  in order to "cache" the value?
[08:00:23] <diamonds> or doesn't .data check for a data attribute every time?
[08:00:59] <Kambfhase> diamonds: the differens between the jQuery data cache and the data-foo attribute is that jQuer conserves the data type.
[08:01:19] <diamonds> ah
[08:01:24] <Cell> ehy guys
[08:01:41] <Cell> need some help i'm using nivo slider and some jquery animation ease
[08:01:46] <Kambfhase> i coulb be toltally wrong though
[08:01:46] <Cell> both arent working together
[08:01:55] <Cell> any idea how to fix issue like that ?
[08:02:15] <diamonds> but if I cache it as mentioned above, then do operatio($(this).data('offsetY')) isn't it going to check the element for a data-offsetY attribute AGAIN?
[08:02:45] <diamonds> or does it 1) check for cached value 2) if not present, check elem attribs ?
[08:02:50] <aaairc> can you have more than one $(document).ready() on your page or is that bad practice?
[08:02:58] <Kambfhase> if you already cached something, the newer is used.
[08:03:11] <diamonds> ??
[08:03:11] <Cell> f.easing[e.animatedProperties[this.prop]] is not a function
[08:03:18] <diamonds> the newer, not the cached one?
[08:03:30] <diamonds> how does it determine which is newer?
[08:03:42] <diamonds> it must check the element attributes...
[08:03:49] <Kambfhase> hm, i think jquery prevers the cached version
[08:04:15] <diamonds> what did you mean by "the newer is used"?
[08:05:17] <Kambfhase> I dont know, that was just a random list of chars coming out of my brain.
[08:06:51] <phlp> diamonds: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L257
[08:07:43] <diamonds> thank you phlp
[08:08:20] <CaptainQuirk> kborchers:  I'm loading the html part that is related to the action clicked by the user. If JS isn't enabled, he will be able to use normal php links. If it is, I'm preloading the rest of the markup just afterwards
[08:08:41] <CaptainQuirk> Seems to me like an effective way to do, don't you think ?
[08:08:47] <diamonds> from the docs: " The data- attributes are pulled in the first time the data property is accessed and then are no longer accessed or mutated (all data values are then stored internally in jQuery)."
[08:09:20] <diamonds> it looks like it does NOT check to see if the value has changed because it's assuming that you're not changing the value outside of jquery.
[08:10:02] <diamonds> so if you are, or need to update the value for another script or something, you'd need to explicitly update the attribute value (via attr) if I understand this correctly
[08:10:30] <diamonds> SO, there is no value to this $(this).data('offsetY', parseInt($(this).attr('data-offsetY')));
[08:10:56] <diamonds> you just use $(this).data('offsetY'); //when you need it and jquery caches it after the first time
[08:11:22] <Lion31> I am having troubles with binding events.... I'd like to bind a live click event to all my links that have applink class.... so doing something like $('a.applink').live("click", function(){....}); ...and it works... the function binded does load some ajax content.... the roblem is, that when I click on the link for second time... the event is triggered 4 times!!!! can somebody tell me why? how
[08:11:23] <Lion31> to prevent this? what are best practices? are there any extra tools that would help me debug jquery events?
[08:12:13] <Cell> guys i got some issue here : http://newband.dreamax.co.il/ the nivo slider isnt working cuz the easing plugin
[08:12:21] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: not sure if i completely understand what you're doing but i don't code for disabled JS anymore. if someone really goes in and disables JS in their browser, they have to expect that most sites will be broken for them.
[08:12:40] <Eviltwin> It'd be nice if there was a queue system here
[08:13:31] <kborchers> Lion31: do you really need to use live? see ?bind
[08:13:32] <bot-t> Lion31, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[08:13:39] <CaptainQuirk> And I understand that... No problem. What I'm looking for is a way to synchronize the response of the ajax call and the readiness of the dom
[08:14:27] <CaptainQuirk> I'm trying to find something to put in the "success" member of $.ajax something that checks if the dom is loaded
[08:14:33] <CaptainQuirk> then append it
[08:14:47] <Lion31> kborchers:  I need live of course, couse the links with applink class are getting generated dynamically all the time
[08:15:20] <kborchers> Lion31: can you give us some code to help with your multiple click issue? see ?demo
[08:15:21] <bot-t> Lion31, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:16:43] <greytrilby> hi chaps - having a little validation trouble. In my form, if there's a problem it alerts me correctly, but if there isn't I have to click 'submit' twice to submit the form. Code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/8N2Y6/ I know I'm missing something obvious, I just can't see what it is - can you please advise?
[08:17:10] <mattelacchiatoJQ> hi!
[08:17:28] <greytrilby> hiya
[08:17:54] <Lion31> bot-t: http://razvoj.mesetar.com .... there is a tabber menu... with tabs "zadnji oglasi" | "popularni oglasi" ....click on "Zadnji oglasi" after the load click again...
[08:17:54] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: hmmm, i think you could put another $(document).ready(function() {...}); inside your success handler. though still not sure why you don't just run the AJAX call after the DOM is ready. if it takes a while to load, you could just use some visual loading queue
[08:17:55] <bot-t> Lion31, Stored "http://razvoj.mesetar.com .... there".
[08:17:59] <mattelacchiatoJQ> I've a problem with catching a 401 error via $.ajax
[08:18:22] <kborchers> ?imabot @ Lion31
[08:18:22] <bot-t> Lion31, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[08:18:26] <Lion31> kborchers: ment for you....
[08:18:27] <Lion31> :D
[08:18:31] <Lion31> sorry
[08:18:34] <kborchers> ;)
[08:19:00] <mattelacchiatoJQ> the given url returns a 401, but it's not caught by "error:" nor "statusCode:"...
[08:19:29] <CaptainQuirk> Well : It's only html and it won't be displayed until the user clicks on a link.
[08:19:29] <Protomega> So after extensive testing I have determined that the problem is the click event is not firing.
[08:19:44] <Protomega> Not sure what to do
[08:20:06] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: if the user is clicking a link, isn't the dom ready?
[08:20:36] * greytrilby joins the queue for help
[08:20:49] <CaptainQuirk> yes, but I will have to load some json data afterwards
[08:21:17] <CaptainQuirk> I would like to have several ajax call one after the other
[08:21:27] <kborchers> Lion31: hmmm, not sure what I should be seeing that is wrong?
[08:22:20] <Lion31> kborchers: see the console.... the page loading is triggered 4 times after secon click on the tab
[08:22:25] <Lion31> it should be only once
[08:23:00] <CaptainQuirk> I followed your advise and I get an exception because of the $.when

[08:23:19] <bot-t> CaptainQuirk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:23:20] <Cell> anyone can help me ?!?
[08:23:40] <greytrilby> 'sup Cell - can't promise a solution, but will have a go!
[08:23:43] <CaptainQuirk> will think about it
[08:23:50] <CaptainQuirk> thx anyway !
[08:24:05] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: just a little hard to work it out all in my head without seeing anything
[08:24:13] <Tomashe> have you seen the website greytriby?
[08:24:21] <CaptainQuirk> that's ok
[08:24:24] <greytrilby> which one?
[08:24:27] <CaptainQuirk> I can make a paste
[08:24:38] <CaptainQuirk> but the site isn't online for the present time
[08:24:49] <Tomashe>  Cell is now known as Tomashe
[08:24:53] <Tomashe> its me Cell
[08:24:57] <greytrilby> i know :)
[08:25:01] <diamonds> Kambfhase: phlp: a test: http://jsfiddle.net/sequoia/xLTtg/
[08:25:03] <greytrilby> but I didn't see a link to a site...
[08:25:08] <Tomashe> guys i got some issue here : http://newband.dreamax.co.il/ the nivo slider isnt working cuz the easing plugin
[08:25:16] <diamonds> thanks for your input! (moreso phlp, to be honest ;)
[08:25:19] <PrinceES> having problem while loading video on the jquery banner slider frame..... please have a look on it.. ...http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[08:25:49] <greytrilby> where's the slider supposed to be?
[08:26:34] <CaptainQuirk> kborchers: http://pastie.org/2202378
[08:26:37] <CaptainQuirk> if you want
[08:26:41] <CaptainQuirk> it's kind of short
[08:26:52] <Tomashe> on the top
[08:26:58] <Tomashe> you can see the images switch
[08:27:01] <Tomashe> top images
[08:27:04] <greytrilby> @Tomashe - looks like the script isn't being called properly - lots of 'not a function' errors
[08:27:11] <kborchers> Lion31: i'm having trouble finding the code that you referenced in your original question
[08:27:43] <Tomashe> yes
[08:28:01] <Tomashe> the nivo.slider and the ease pluging are not working together
[08:28:04] <greytrilby> have you correctly referenced the script in the header?
[08:28:07] <Tomashe> i dont know how to fix it
[08:28:16] <skypce> hi
[08:28:28] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: get rid of the $.when
[08:28:29] <m0dmd> good day everyone!
[08:28:30] <greytrilby> so you've tested so that if you disable one, the other works
[08:28:59] <Lion31> kborchers: yes... I know... it would be to time consuming to make a clean working example dor you to try ;) I'll figure it out myself ;) thanks for your time
[08:29:04] <skypce> have some code for manage the display:table-cell and display:table-row in ie7]=
[08:29:19] <Tomashe> yes
[08:29:19] <skypce> thank :D
[08:29:34] <Tomashe> and its working if i disable the easeing
[08:29:46] <greytrilby> hmmm... think that's a bit above my skill level I'm afraid!
[08:29:48] <PrinceES> <greytrilby> -- here you can see the whole code---- http://jsfiddle.net/c2MH7/2/
[08:30:01] <CaptainQuirk> kborchers: I have to do it only when it's loaded. How can I test that
[08:30:41] <PrinceES> i want to load a video once user will be clicked the link on the banner inside slider...
[08:31:00] <greytrilby> PrinceES - the problem being that your video isn't IN the slider?
[08:31:02] <Tomashe> :/
[08:31:08] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: $(document).ready(...) only runs after the dom is ready. no need to test. it waits for you ... though it will most likely fire before your other ready down below so if you have to wait on that ...
[08:31:27] <PrinceES> want to played the video like as this example-.-- http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[08:31:30] <kborchers> you should just put your code in there
[08:31:43] <Kambfhase> diamonds: cool, i'll keep the link for future reference
[08:32:10] <PrinceES> <greytrilby>  I am newer on it... therefore.. want to know... how can i do this..
[08:32:11] <CaptainQuirk> I will think about that, yes ! It works by the way ! Thx
[08:32:20] <kborchers> CaptainQuirk: np
[08:32:28] <PrinceES> i just fetched XML data through DB
[08:32:36] <PrinceES> and i have the video link....
[08:33:03] <PrinceES> only want to load once someone will click over the big image´s title for watching the video
[08:34:04] <PrinceES> here is the code of the video... http://jsfiddle.net/Uw98B/
[08:34:41] <greytrilby> so - there's an image on the left, and the three buttons on the right. When you click the image on the left, you want the video to load in that area, yes?
[08:35:01] <PrinceES> i want to make this set of code enable once someone will click on the big image of slider ..... just like as -......http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[08:35:16] <PrinceES> yes yes
[08:35:30] <PrinceES> <greytrilby> i really want exactly this... what you said
[08:35:46] <PrinceES> thanks in advance
[08:36:37] <greytrilby> and the problem you're having is that the video is *always* being displayed in that location lower down, yes?
[08:37:28] <PrinceES> well... i just pasted that video for having an idea ... especially to you guys
[08:38:14] <PrinceES> that flash video what you can see at below is just for showing you to have an idea that i want to load this kind of video if someone will click on the left image
[08:38:21] <djQuery> morning
[08:38:29] <Protomega> Okay I'm going to get fresh eyes on this again: http://pastebin.com/TBaxpa9U
[08:38:44] <Protomega> My click event isn't firing
[08:39:22] <djQuery> Protomega: you might have better luck putting together a demo without all the php code in it. see ?demo
[08:39:23] <bot-t> Protomega, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:39:47] <PrinceES> if you may look on my code ... http://jsfiddle.net/c2MH7/3/ ...
[08:39:50] <Protomega> WIll do brb sorry :)
[08:40:07] <djQuery> Prometheus: just copy the output for the most part
[08:40:15] <PrinceES> on this following line ....  $('#showcase').append(
[08:40:31] <greytrilby> PrinceES - try removing all the extra divs - just place the contents of the 'object' tag in the xml
[08:40:33] <Protomega> What that directed towards me djQuery?
[08:40:42] <PrinceES> ok...
[08:40:45] <greytrilby> the reason it's out of position is those divs
[08:40:54] <PrinceES> but...
[08:40:57] <greytrilby> there's a lot of html in there which is probably what's throwing it out
[08:41:18] <PrinceES> i think i need to paste this set of div code inside ... a function of jquery
[08:41:30] <PrinceES> and put a onclick event.....
[08:41:41] <PrinceES> and passing to the video link
[08:41:49] <greytrilby> yes - you need to pass the video link
[08:42:14] <PrinceES> is there not any example.. that i can see and use it
[08:42:25] <greytrilby> nope - you need to understand the logic really
[08:42:28] <PrinceES> because it is hard to understand everything ... maunually
[08:42:35] <PrinceES> yes..
[08:42:42] <greytrilby> You have a script that runs - when you click a button on the right, something appears on the left - yes?
[08:42:52] <PrinceES> i have my logic clear but roughtly
[08:43:07] <Protomega> djQuery, jsfiddle is going sorta slow sorry :)
[08:43:18] <PrinceES> nope---- i dont have a script for this
[08:43:26] <PrinceES> that is a problem...
[08:43:30] <djQuery> Protomega: jsbin is workin fine
[08:43:36] <PrinceES> i am thinking to make a function
[08:43:44] <Protomega> It's because of the amount of data I believe
[08:43:46] <PrinceES> but no idea where do i need to put ...
[08:43:48] <greytrilby> you do - otherwise clicking on the right image won't make something appear on the left!
[08:44:31] <PrinceES> because wheneever i call or add another $('#showcase').append(.... .. it wouldnt work
[08:44:40] <greytrilby> Start simple!
[08:44:50] <PrinceES> but...
[08:44:55] <necromancer> hey PrinceES, just a little tidbit: don't define functions in $(document).ready
[08:45:01] <necromancer> define them before the ready call
[08:45:10] <gnoirzox> hello everybody
[08:45:12] <PrinceES> http://jsfiddle.net/c2MH7/3/
[08:45:14] <necromancer> good practice = less confusion = happier PrinceES ;)
[08:45:24] <PrinceES> <necromancer>  look at this
[08:45:28] <greytrilby> @necromancer - good spot!
[08:45:38] <greytrilby> @necromancer - you seem wise in the ways of the force...
[08:45:42] <necromancer> lol
[08:45:52] <necromancer> i've just tore my hair out enough times to know good practice
[08:46:04] <PrinceES> <necromancer> thanks for understanding me
[08:46:10] <necromancer> PrinceES: i saw it, that's how i knew the function was in the doc read
[08:46:12] <necromancer> y
[08:46:22] <Protomega> necromancer, got anymore tips?
[08:46:51] <PrinceES> <necromancer> how can make it like as http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[08:47:17] <necromancer> PrinceES: are you trying to play a video inline or in a popup lightbox?
[08:47:32] <PrinceES> inline
[08:47:36] <greytrilby> @necromancer - he's trying to play it inline
[08:47:38] <necromancer> oh ok
[08:47:38] <PrinceES> same like as you can see on the http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[08:48:01] <greytrilby> PrinceES - can you show us the code you're using on that page at the moment?
[08:48:20] <greytrilby> @PrinceES I'm not seeing the click function that changes the left content when you click the right tab
[08:48:26] <necromancer> PrinceES: since there's no content in #showcase, try using $('#showcase').html() to add the content in
[08:48:46] <PrinceES> if you want i can sent you the whole source code.. which is about 1.5 MB
[08:48:58] <necromancer> use single quotes and make sure every single quote is escaped (if there are any)
[08:49:07] <PrinceES> or i can paste on http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:49:08] <necromancer> so $('#showcase').html('your-<object>-code');
[08:49:32] <greytrilby> PrinceES - I think necromancer might be right here
[08:49:44] <necromancer> PrinceES: also, defining an extra function is not necessary. just define that in `success:`
[08:50:11] <Protomega> Strong...
[08:50:14] <Protomega> It works in jQuery
[08:50:29] <greytrilby> @necromancer - you any good with the validation plugin? I'm tearing my hair out
[08:50:34] * greytrilby is being metaphorical
[08:50:36] <Protomega> jsfiddle*
[08:50:43] <necromancer> greytrilby: heh...kinda, what's your issue?
[08:50:54] * necromancer finds that validate is quite powerful but poorly documented
[08:51:00] <greytrilby> In my form, if there's a problem it alerts me correctly, but if there isn't I have to click 'submit' twice to submit the form. Code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/8N2Y6/ I know I'm missing something obvious, I just can't see what it is - can you please advise?
[08:51:09] * greytrilby agrees entirely on the documentation thing
[08:51:23] <greytrilby> I think I might have just put stuff in the wrong order
[08:51:30] <Protomega> Wait so necromancer do you have any more tips?
[08:52:08] <necromancer> Protomega: for what?
[08:52:10] <necromancer> good practice?
[08:52:23] <Protomega> Well actually.. Anything with programming :P
[08:52:41] <Protomega> All good advice is worth listening to
[08:53:11] <greytrilby> The only solutions I'm seeing involve using ajaxSubmit(), but I'm not using that plugin, and to do so would mean re-writing about 30 pages!
[08:53:21] <necromancer> Protomega: have fun, i guess. and read.
[08:53:52] * greytrilby will return presently once he's put the washing on *is domesticated*
[08:54:04] <php101uk> Hi Guys, Having a problem with IE9, keep getting this error: SCRIPT65535: Invalid calling object, code is in pastebin: http://pastebin.com/CdNdYNQ9 - Works perfectly in FF and Chrome/Safari - can anyone help...
[08:54:05] <Protomega> That's the problem! I'm not having fun. I don't find enjoyment out of systems that aren't working the day after I made them work.
[08:55:05] <djQuery> greytrilby: doesnt the validate plugin allready bind to the submit when call it that way?
[08:55:25] <diamonds> oooo... I see more useless code http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/12/behind-the-scenes-of-nike-better-world/comment-page-1/#comment-544166
[08:55:42] <diamonds> apparently a design blog is not the best place to get your javascript tips... :/
[08:55:53] <djQuery> greytrilby: so in the submit handler you are binding to the submit handler?
[08:56:04] <Protomega> Oh hey there diamonds.
[08:57:07] <necromancer> Protomega: do you not get enjoyment out of the idea or the actual implementation?
[08:57:40] <Protomega> Sort of, it's hard for me to learn because I always try and go deeper and deeper into one subject.
[08:58:39] <Protomega> For example I just requested a book from the library on the history of Character code because I was interested in why "k" > "A"
[08:59:17] <greytrilby> ahh..  I did wonder that, but I'm not sure how to unbind it!
[08:59:31] <Protomega> Which the reason is because k is in position 0x107 while A is in position 0x65
[08:59:37] <diamonds> correct me if I'm wrong but this is just a hackity way of doing .is(":visible"), right? http://pastie.org/2202532
[09:00:06] <greytrilby> @djQuery I tend to learn best from example code, I just couldn't find any that didn't use ajaxSubmit
[09:00:50] <Protomega> But we started out with a-z and not A-Z so I was wondering why we placed A-Z before a-z. I read that it was because we wanted it to match britain's code standards so now I'm looking into why Britain did such positioning.
[09:01:12] <greytrilby> so would I be right in thinking that if I removed the " $('#admin_form').submit(function(e){ " line (and associated curly at the end) it should work?
[09:01:13] <Protomega> And that is the reason why I never get anything I need to done. ^-^
[09:01:45] <greytrilby> @protomega - cos we invented the language and can do whatever we want *g*
[09:01:55] * greytrilby is, of course, being sarcastic
[09:02:24] <Protomega> It's hard to tell sarcasm from ignorance when you live in #web :3
[09:03:00] <orolo> how does one detect if a box is 'out of bounds' in the browser window?
[09:03:07] <greytrilby> @proto - not with me - I'm both sarcastic AND ignorant - apologies for being flippant :)
[09:03:21] <diamonds> orolo: see what I just posted incidentally ^
[09:03:25] <Protomega> Haha very good. :)
[09:03:29] <diamonds> http://pastie.org/2202532
[09:03:42] <diamonds> needs more stuff....
[09:03:44] <orolo> ah! thanks
[09:03:56] <diamonds> orolo: actually it doesn't work as-is
[09:03:59] <diamonds> orolo: sorry
[09:04:19] <orolo> diamonds: i just need the Window values and can probably much through the rest.
[09:04:24] <orolo> *muck
[09:04:47] <php101uk> wow - tough crowd!
[09:04:47] <greytrilby> @djQuery - I've removed the second bind ( the .submit(e) function bit, but now it doesn't post anything
[09:04:57] <Protomega> It seems the more I work on the problem, the more I screw things up.
[09:05:07] <greytrilby> @proto - I know that feeling!
[09:05:29] <greytrilby> Just when I thought I had something working it's now gone down the pan. Was supposed to code 8 pages today (simple upgrade) - I've not even finished one yet!
[09:05:45] * greytrilby curses poor documentation
[09:05:46] <Protomega> When I started working on the problem I had the ui-darkness from jQueryUI working.. Now I don't even have that!
[09:05:58] <greytrilby> heh - I use lightness
[09:06:04] * greytrilby wonders if that is significant
[09:06:45] <djQuery> greytrilby: $('myform').validate({options}).submit(function(){})    this way the validate will bind to the submit and your submit handler will also bind.
[09:06:54] <Protomega> Oh boy.
[09:07:12] <Protomega> See, this is why I dispise javascript. I fixed every single problem just now.
[09:07:12] <greytrilby> gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
[09:07:14] <djQuery> I think it is first in first out. if the validate returns false then it wont submit it
[09:07:32] <greytrilby> @djquery - I'll try that. And will return
[09:07:34] <ambackstrom> What's a good way of creating a list of elements to pass back to a calling function? An array of jQuery objects seems to fail with append(): http://jsfiddle.net/abackstrom/bT482/2/
[09:07:35] <greytrilby> Probably
[09:07:51] <diamonds> is there an "inView()" functin?
[09:07:56] <Protomega> WOuld you like to know what it was? I failed to put );
[09:07:57] <diamonds> to check if it's in the viewport?
[09:08:03] <djQuery> greytrilby: but its been I while since I used the validate plugin
[09:08:17] <Protomega> Once I placed that, all twelve problems went away.
[09:08:20] <djQuery> ?:visible
[09:08:20] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[09:08:42] <greytrilby> @djQuery - your double-submit pointer nailed it.
[09:09:07] <diamonds> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/sequoia/h8XFE/embedded/result/
[09:09:19] <greytrilby> @dj - removing the second bind elemnt caused the $(this).serialise to fall over (because $this was undefined) - once I redefined it, it worked!
[09:09:36] <braddunbar> Anyone had experience with a good html5 microdata plugin?  I've found microdatajs (http://gitorious.org/microdatajs) and it seems to be pretty nice.
[09:09:40] <diamonds> djQuery: that seems to check if it's !hidden !display:none !opacity:0
[09:09:52] <greytrilby> @proto - I tend to punctuate with semi colons even when I don't need it!
[09:10:10] <djQuery> diamonds: yeah I was poking around looking for one that would work. unfort that aint it
[09:10:12] <greytrilby> @proto - at least in php it says "expected ';' - jquery is v. frustrating that way
[09:10:14] <Protomega> I'm still trying to get use when to use ; and what not.
[09:10:43] <djQuery> greytrilby: jslint or jshint would catch that for you
[09:10:59] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ajisef/12/edit
[09:11:00] <Protomega> I shall start using jslint then.
[09:11:00] <diamonds> I'm really surprised this isn't built into core, if it in fact isn't
[09:11:58] <impi> hello, is anyone using rangepicker from filament group? it's a datepicker, and i am struggeling to get the dates i have selected
[09:12:16] <djQuery> diamonds: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
[09:12:46] <diamonds> yeah and this guy http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/
[09:12:48] <diamonds> ty djQuery
[09:13:37] <djQuery> diamonds: Remy is a very sharp fella. I would use his.
[09:13:55] <diamonds> remy "sharp"
[09:14:02] <diamonds> ic wat u did there ;)
[09:15:16] <djQuery> hmmmm wait this one doesnt actualy allow you to select when an item is visible it just adds a new event for when the item becomes visible or invisible
[09:16:53] <diamonds> djQuery: I want the appletini functionality
[09:17:03] <greytrilby> @djQuery - thanks for your help - happy as a pig in mud (for now!)
[09:17:05] <diamonds> I want to filter by .is("in-viewport")
[09:17:09] <diamonds> not bind to inview
[09:17:46] * djQuery happy as a wrestler at a folding chair factory
[09:20:04] <caz> Hi there
[09:20:19] <diamonds> djQuery: heh... the comments on the appelsiini one aren't... they aren't universally positive
[09:20:35] * djQuery thinks of welcom back cotter any time someone says "Hi there"
[09:20:43] <Corey> djQuery is a great nick. :-)
[09:20:50] <impi> guys, can someone please give me a clue on how to get the date range i have selected when using this plugin? http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/date_range_picker_using_jquery_ui_16_and_jquery_ui_css_framework/ i have used jQuery ui date picker before and it work, but with this plugin i cannot get the date. if i try to get the value of the input then it's like i am always getting the previous date and not the current selected one
[09:21:30] <djQuery> ?demo@empi
[09:21:30] <bot-t> empi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:22:17] <impi> djQuery, my site is dev.micket.me
[09:22:31] <impi> the date input is the one in the filter to the right..
[09:22:37] <impi> i am using this code:
[09:24:10] <djQuery> impi: well its obviously putting the correct date in the input so why not just use $('#startdata').val()?
[09:24:43] <impi> djQuery, i did try that :) but then i always get the date that i have previously selected. not the current one..it's like i get a lag
[09:24:59] <impi> djQuery, here is my calls: http://pastebin.com/jcH1kJJt
[09:25:16] <impi> im stumped with this one man
[09:26:16] <djQuery> impi: well it accepts all the default datapicker options. so couldnt you just do a function in onClose or onSelect
[09:26:34] <ambackstrom> I have an array of jQuery objects that I'd like to append to an element. Do I have to use $.each() to add them? http://jsfiddle.net/abackstrom/bT482/3/
[09:26:47] <djQuery> either of those will have the dateText as a parameter
[09:26:57] <impi> djQuery, with jquery ui working perfectly i just do:  onSelect: function(date, picker) { alert(date);
[09:27:04] <djQuery> ambackstrom: see ?appendTo
[09:27:05] <bot-t> ambackstrom, .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[09:27:41] <ambackstrom> I can't use appendTo, I have an array as the top-level item
[09:27:54] <ambackstrom> i.e. ['foo'].appendto()
[09:28:57] <djQuery> ambackstrom: not enough cafinee yet put together a demo see ?demo
[09:28:58] <bot-t> ambackstrom, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:28:59] <ambackstrom> I tried using $.add() rather than creating an array, but couldn't get it to work as I expected. creating the initial empty jQuery object was a problem
[09:29:12] <ambackstrom> djQuery: djQuery
[09:29:15] <ambackstrom> err
[09:29:21] <ambackstrom> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/abackstrom/bT482/3/
[09:31:08] <djQuery> ambackstrom: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bT482/4/
[09:31:20] <djQuery> little different that what u were doing but it works
[09:31:59] <ambackstrom> djQuery: I'm hoping to build the list of LI elements in a function that is agnostic to the parent
[09:32:40] <ambackstrom> This variation works, but the $.each() doesn't feel very natural http://jsfiddle.net/abackstrom/bT482/5/
[09:33:37] <impi> ffs it's a bug
[09:34:29] <djQuery> ambackstrom: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bT482/6/
[09:35:00] <phlp> ambackstrom: http://jsfiddle.net/bT482/7
[09:35:11] <djQuery> ambackstrom: basicaly the same thing you had.
[09:35:59] <ambackstrom> phlp: ooh :)
[09:36:03] <djQuery> phlp: haddent seen that before
[09:36:07] <Trudko> guys whats selector if i want to find every a but ignore a with class test for example
[09:36:32] <Trudko> $("#myDiv a.) .... for all A
[09:36:43] <ambackstrom> phlp: Thanks. I need to get more comfortable with call/apply
[09:36:52] <Connorhd> a[class!=test] I guess
[09:36:56] <djQuery> Trudko: $('.getthese').not('.notthese') would be about the fastest
[09:36:59] <phlp> np :) https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/function/apply
[09:37:07] <Connorhd> a[class!="test"] even
[09:37:24] <djQuery> there is also a :not but it would be slow
[09:37:33] <djQuery> ?.not
[09:37:34] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[09:37:40] <djQuery> ?:not
[09:37:41] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[09:38:23] <djQuery> .not would be the fastest. Trudko
[09:38:42] <systemfault> Why not use the most elegant way?
[09:39:10] <systemfault> Who cares about the speed of the selectors, you should cache nodes anyway.
[09:39:26] <joeellis> in jquery templates, does the following syntax not work anymore: $("#template").render(data).appendTo("#container")
[09:40:00] <joeellis> I just get an Object [object Object] has no method 'render' error
[09:40:59] <joeellis> Or is there a new way to render in place new data into a template?
[09:43:44] <multipass> hi, im trying to pass the background style of a div to a variable, and re-attach it later on, but im having a problem.. i believe with the double quotes, when it re attaches.
[09:43:54] <thebignoise> how do i get the URL?
[09:44:04] <thebignoise> anchor based URL's more specifically?
[09:44:22] <djQuery> systemfault: well I gues that would depend on how often you need to refresh that cached variable and how coplex your selector is
[09:44:25] <ryanneufeld> $.css() @ multipass
[09:44:39] <ryanneufeld> BOOOTTTTT----TTTTT
[09:44:46] <mirco> Hi, I have a problem setting a .hover() and I am to dumb right now to recognise my error. Can someone please look at http://pastebin.com/kPxk9TCH
[09:44:58] <lastent> hi, I am using the drag& drop, and I want to get a attr form the draggin element(a div), the attr is the "value" of the div, I am getting it this way $(ui.draggable).attr('value'), but it returns undefined, what can I do?
[09:45:02] <systemfault> djQuery: I agree.
[09:45:04] <djQuery> joeellis: thats not templates that jsviews
[09:45:59] <php101uk> Is there a way to find out what browser plugins are loaded?
[09:46:04] <php101uk> in jQuery
[09:46:05] <djQuery> joeellis: but render just generates a string not actual html elements. but that should still work
[09:46:07] <joeellis> djQuery: Is jquery Templates just for appending stuff, or just simple templates?
[09:46:27] <djQuery> joeellis: http://jsbin.com/ajisef/12/edit
[09:46:29] <thebignoise> anyone know how to get anchor based urls with jQuery
[09:47:07] <tiemonster> .attr('href')
[09:47:16] <kojiro> ":target"?
[09:47:33] <mirco> .attr("target")
[09:48:18] <kojiro> oh, thebignoise  $('[href*="#"]') is probably what you want
[09:48:24] <pnhChris> $("a[href^="#"")
[09:48:32] <tiemonster> %&*%&*$^&@^&*$
[09:48:36] <pnhChris> er.. missing closing ]
[09:48:47] <kojiro> pnhChris: attribute-based selector does not necessarily start with an octothorpe
[09:49:25] <pnhChris> well, depends on the code
[09:49:33] <pnhChris> and what the questioner means
[09:49:34] <kojiro> doesn't everything?
[09:49:44] <tiemonster> anchor urls are things like "#coolShtuff", which still uses href
[09:49:51] <pnhChris> yours selects off domain urls too
[09:49:52] <thebignoise> neither of them worked :(
[09:50:03] <kojiro> thebignoise: then you haven't adequately asked the question.
[09:50:11] <kojiro> pnhChris: quite right.
[09:50:20] <joeellis> djQuery: Not sure I quite understand, jQuery templates can't just re-render data into the same template?
[09:50:20] <ravenzz> what's the matter?
[09:50:55] <thebignoise> kojiro: thats about as good as it gets. How do I get an anchored based URL?
[09:51:16] <kojiro> thebignoise: no, we already answered that question *correctly*
[09:51:21] <thebignoise> kojiro: i dont have any <a>
[09:51:38] <kojiro> what do you have?
[09:51:44] <pnhChris> you mean URL as in the HTML tags, or the URL bar in the browser?
[09:51:52] <thebignoise> browser

[09:52:17] <kojiro> thebignoise: $(":target")
[09:53:06] <thebignoise> kojiro: o shit my bad guess. my console got flooded with crap and i didnt even notice my jquery library load failed
[09:53:21] <thebignoise> so i cant really use jQ w/ out that
[09:53:21] <thebignoise> hehe
[09:53:36] <kojiro> thebignoise: $(":target").attr("href") if you like, will give you the href attribute of the currently "targeted" anchor element *iff* it exists.
[09:54:00] <mirco> Can someone give me a hint why this is not working? http://pastebin.com/kPxk9TCH
[09:54:16] <ravenzz> mirco jsfiddle.net
[09:54:32] <ravenzz> we need to test the code
[09:54:46] <mirco> Ok 1 sec
[09:55:01] <thebignoise> kojiro: no no your first solution was gold, i just loaded the library wrong and no jQ was working. sry.
[09:55:14] <thebignoise> kojiro: thanx a bunch
[09:58:15] <thebignoise> one last question. (if this is where i should ask it) is there a way to append to the current anchor based URL w/ out jQ? Just setup the href correctly
[09:58:59] <djQuery> mirco: instead of looping through each one why not $('#activepage').delegate('[data-acco]', 'hover', function(e){  $(this).toggleClass('whatever'); });
[09:59:09] <ravenzz> mirco anyway. the probleme is that when you get the ID, you will have just the "name"...later when you try to select the element with that ID, you have to add an #
[09:59:17] <ravenzz> mirco so $('#'+id)
[09:59:24] <thesibe> hello
[09:59:25] <thesibe> i need help, i'm using the jquery slideUp/slideDown functions but they are not what im looking for... they simply change the div height, i want something that really slide down i mean the bottom goes down until the div entirely appears
[09:59:27] <djQuery> and your acco var is no longer in scope when you get to the hover
[10:00:17] <thesibe> may u help me ?

[10:06:14] <azra-el> hello is there a something like http://www.datatables.net/ but without tables? or is everybody using tables for this?
[10:07:10] <djQuery> azra-el: YES, i believe 99.999 of sites use tables to display tabular data
[10:07:28] <snover> THAT IS A SHOCKING STATISTIC
[10:09:00] <thesibe> djQuery: http://www.iverba.com/test1/s1.html
[10:09:14] <thesibe> jquery simple slide changing the height of the div
[10:09:26] <thesibe> i want the content to slide properly like in the example
[10:09:34] <azra-el> ummm dont need to get bitchy ... i just asked a simple question really
[10:10:24] <rahil> Hi, I have aspx page, on the main page I am calling a ajax function which starts a lengthy processing on server... on the same page I have placed an iframe which do ajax calls to the server to display certain information on iframe. ... The problem: It seems the ajax calls are getting blocked, the calls from iframe only seem to work when the first ajax call is returned... any ideas
[10:10:31] <djQuery> azra-el: errr. I just provided a simple answer
[10:10:33] <thesibe> any help ?
[10:11:09] <azra-el> djQuery,  i was reffering to snover's answer.. my bad anyway if i over reacted.. i just hate tables :)
[10:11:15] <djQuery> thesibe: put some text in the jquery one. format it using css to cuase the text to go to the bottom?
[10:11:34] <thesibe> there is not only text in the div
[10:12:04] <thesibe> but isn't there a plugin ready made to make that animation ?
[10:12:15] <djQuery> azra-el:  layout+tables=bad  tabular data+tables = good
[10:12:38] <impi> god dammit find it...
[10:12:48] <rahil> does multiple ajax calls get blocked ?
[10:12:51] <impi> bloody so cryptic like a damn secret of egypt
[10:13:00] <thesibe> rahil only 2 connection at time
[10:13:03] <azra-el> djQuery,  u do have a point... thanks
[10:13:04] <impi> fuckit, pizza time, beer++
[10:13:06] <djQuery> thesibe: then use animate to change the top padding instead of slide
[10:13:28] <thesibe> djquery
[10:13:39] <thesibe> the content is not in the bottom of the div
[10:13:42] <thesibe> the entire div is the content
[10:13:46] <azra-el> djQuery,  ok and using tables right... what would be my easiest solution ..http://www.datatables.net/ ? or do u recommend something else
[10:13:49] <thesibe> i mean that the content should appear in that way
[10:13:54] <thesibe> bottom appear first
[10:14:10] <rahil> thesibe: any work around to make multiple ajax calls?
[10:14:20] <djQuery> azra-el: the easiest solution is win the lottery and quit
[10:14:33] <djQuery> not the most likely solution however.
[10:15:26] <thesibe> djQuery: http://www.iverba.com/test1/s2.html
[10:15:29] <thesibe> here is more clear
[10:15:32] <djQuery> rahil: no they dont get blocked. well unless u open more than the browser can handle. think u need to put your question in better context
[10:15:34] <azra-el> was wondering if there's a plugin for that
[10:15:35] <thesibe> ops
[10:16:26] <thesibe> http://www.iverba.com/test1/s3.html
[10:16:27] <thesibe> see this
[10:17:19] <rahil> djQuery: I am sending one request through ajax (from the main page). and another ajax request from iframe of the same page.. the break point of iframe ajax call only occurs after completion of first ajax call
[10:19:13] <thesibe> djQuery any help ? XD
[10:19:18] * djQuery *yuck* iframe
[10:19:23] <thesibe> iframe ?
[10:20:17] <djQuery> thesibe: no I dont have any help. with .animate you can make it change just about anything you want.
[10:30:43] <swiggy> does anyone know how to use the link's parent CSS instead of the website the link is on CSS when using colorbox?
[10:31:13] <phlp> rahil: if you are using sessions then that is your problem. asp.net requests are synchronous when they are from the same session so your first call is blocking the others
[10:31:15] <swiggy> so the link that my colorbox is loading, i want the content of that colorbox to use the css from that site
[10:31:20] <swiggy> not my sites css
[10:32:43] <harriswong_> is it a known issue that the scale, shake, size, slide effect on http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggle/ fails to work after choosing "pulsate"?
[10:33:23] <rahil> phlp: thankx, I think that is exactly my problem
[10:34:11] <phlp> rahil: look here at the bottom "Concurrent Requests and Session State" http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178581.aspx
[10:39:49] <rahil> phlp: thanks that worked
[10:39:59] <phlp> np :)
[10:46:37] <PhanLord> i ahve issue with sortable(), i open a simple-modal dialog with tabs(), and within one of the tabs there are 2 sortable lists (one cna drag between those and reorder etc..), however that works only first time the dialog is open
[10:46:58] <PhanLord> next time i open it sortable is not working anymore (untill i do refresh)

[10:52:04] <RabSimpson> kambfhase, i'm not sure i follow, i installed it just as i install any other plugin
[10:52:09] <RabSimpson> did i miss something out?
[10:52:12] <Kambfhase> RabSimpson: I get a lot of errors in the firebug console.
[10:52:20] <RabSimpson> hmmm ok
[10:52:30] <RabSimpson> let me uninstall it and try it again
[10:54:21] <thebignoise> http://jsfiddle.net/2cEa6/
[10:54:48] <thebignoise> for some reason my code attaches the anchor but it then disappears immediately. any suggestions
[10:55:07] <thebignoise> p.s. you cant duplicate it in js b/c the urls arnt the same
[10:55:15] <thebignoise> but any help would be great
[10:56:42] <Kambfhase> thebignoise: please use http://jshint.com/ to make sure you use good javascript. like declaring variables with var etc.
[10:58:50] <Kambfhase> RabSimpson: while your at it, you can also update to the latest jquery and fancy box version
[11:00:54] <ravenzz> thebignoise http://jsfiddle.net/2cEa6/1/
[11:03:34] <ravenzz> thebignoise anyway, have you ever heard about relative paths?
[11:03:44] <thebignoise> ravenzz: yeah
[11:03:53] <ravenzz> <a class='tag' href='sweet'>SWEET</a>
[11:03:54] <ravenzz> :?
[11:04:31] <thebignoise> i am a compitant programmer don't be an ass.
[11:04:38] <thebignoise> i am trying something a bit new
[11:04:43] <ravenzz> <a class='tag' href='sweet/'>SWEET</a>
[11:04:46] <RabSimpson> kambfhase, i would but i'm limited by what the plugin developer is using
[11:04:46] <Eviltwin> Relative paths are for losers who don't want their code to be portable
[11:04:53] <thebignoise> ravenzz: im doing anchor based
[11:04:59] <ravenzz> ok but
[11:05:01] <EyePulp> compitant speller also... =P
[11:05:08] <thebignoise> EyePulp: lol
[11:05:15] <EyePulp> j/k
[11:06:56] <ravenzz> actually your js snippet performs a relative path emulation (?)
[11:07:02] <ravenzz> sorry but my english sucks
[11:07:27] <RabSimpson> firebug is giving me 'jQuery("a.fancybox").fancybox is not a function' in the console
[11:08:26] <ravenzz> i mean. if the client don't support JS or there is some bug/error in your JS, those links are useless
[11:10:46] <mikeycgto> hey Eviltwin, this is what i was talking about last night: https://github.com/mikeycgto/jquery.whiny.js/blob/master/jquery.whiny.js
[11:18:19] <bkbarton> Hello. Question about animation
[11:18:40] <sadmicrowave> hilko, whats your question about animation?
[11:19:03] <sadmicrowave> oops, I mean 'hi'* not hilko
[11:19:06] <bkbarton> Can you set a absolute px amount for an animation?
[11:19:18] <sadmicrowave> from top or left offset yes
[11:19:52] <bkbarton> I was trying to use scrollTo... but, for some reason I was having some issues with getting elements where I wanted them
[11:20:04] <sadmicrowave> so basically $('selector').animate({left: '100px'},500); will animate your object '100px' from the left of your parentNode
[11:21:02] <bkbarton> Right. say I attach the animation to a .click. The animation will happen each time it is pressed.
[11:21:05] <bkbarton> correct
[11:21:06] <bkbarton> ?
[11:21:08] <sadmicrowave> yes
[11:21:31] <bkbarton> Ok. Since you are so nice chat with
[11:21:33] <bkbarton> ...
[11:22:32] <bkbarton> I have a list of links on the left.... they should correspond to a group of divs with individual info on the main page
[11:22:59] <bkbarton> I would like the links to move the info into a certain viewing area.
[11:23:35] <sadmicrowave> ok
[11:23:41] <bkbarton> ScrollTo should do the trick... but, i guess i'm having issues with getting the info into the correct area
[11:24:07] <bkbarton> Yeah... maybe this is too difficult to cha about
[11:24:14] <sadmicrowave> well ScrollTo isn't really for moving elements, its more for moving the window TO the element
[11:24:23] <bkbarton> Right.
[11:24:33] <sadmicrowave> soee, scrollTo doesn't sound like it is your answer
[11:24:44] <sadmicrowave> so*
[11:25:00] <sadmicrowave> .animate() is the way to go...
[11:25:43] <bkbarton> ok... back to the drawing board
[11:25:50] <sadmicrowave> you can calculate how much you need to move the div by finding the top and left offsets of your parent div and subtracting that amount from the top and left offsets of the div you want to move
[11:26:14] <sadmicrowave> then use that value in the top: 'blah', left: 'blah' fields
[11:26:30] <bkbarton> Right. But, I want to have it move to the correct spot once the btn has been pressed.
[11:26:38] <sadmicrowave> exactly
[11:26:47] <sadmicrowave> hold on I'll show you
[11:32:19] <bkbarton> SadMicrowave.... I feel like I've seen yr name before. On the jquery website or StackOverflow?
[11:34:17] <caz> Hi, I got a litle problem. How can I find href value within this instruction : $("#pages").find("#facet li a")
[11:34:50] <caz> I tried with : .filter("my_href") but that does not work
[11:35:29] <caz> Any ideas?
[11:35:30] <tmayr> caz: if its just one element add .attr('href')
[11:35:44] <Techdeck> hey guys, what is the selector for 'every div after this div'?
[11:35:47] <caz> It's not just one element
[11:35:57] <caz> tmayr: I've got 3 elements
[11:36:01] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, stackoverflow, I'm on there alot
[11:36:12] <Techdeck> or every div with the same class that comes after it within a container
[11:36:18] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, http://jsfiddle.net/SaYsD/1/ something like that
[11:36:57] <tmayr> how about, each(function(){ $(this).attr('href') // rest of the stuff you want? })
[11:37:12] <caz> Ok 'ill try
[11:37:19] <caz> Thanks for the advice
[11:37:27] <caz> I gotta go and i'll try later
[11:37:55] <jedimind_> hey how do you get the current sibling index of the element clicked ?
[11:38:06] <bkbarton> That's cool. What if all of the boxes were on top of one another. And the animation would have btn 2 move box 2 where box 1 is.
[11:38:13] <jedimind_> actually nevermind i dont need it now that i think about it
[11:38:36] <sadmicrowave> jedimind_, it might be in the event handler, use firebug to traverse through it and see if you can find it
[11:39:18] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, like a vertical row instead of horizontal or positioned absolutely on top of each other?
[11:39:48] <phlp> $(this).index()
[11:40:14] <sadmicrowave> phlp he asked for current sibling index, not current index
[11:41:08] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, ??
[11:41:35] <phlp> that returns the current index relative to the siblings, is that not the same thing?
[11:41:54] <bkbarton> positioned absolutely
[11:41:54] <sadmicrowave> maybe I'm confused on what he was asking for
[11:42:11] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, I'd use display:none and display:block for that instead of animating
[11:42:14] <sadmicrowave> hold on
[11:44:10] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, http://jsfiddle.net/SaYsD/3/
[11:45:53] <bkbarton> man... this is all good stuff... but, i need the div boxes to be visible and animate into place.
[11:45:57] <bkbarton> So,
[11:45:59] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, although, I like to take advantage of jQuery's ability to chaining functions and do something more like this http://jsfiddle.net/SaYsD/4/
[11:46:49] <sadmicrowave> I guess I'm not understanding then... you want all the boxes invisible...then when you click on a link, the box turns visible and animates to a spot on the screen?
[11:46:59] <bkbarton> visible.
[11:47:11] <bkbarton> visible boxes moving into place.
[11:47:16] <bkbarton> It sounds weird
[11:47:38] <PhanLord> http://jsfiddle.net/L2ns9/3/
[11:47:55] <sadmicrowave> so what happens to the other boxes (in this case, 2nd, 3rd, 4th ) when the top box starts animating?
[11:48:15] <PhanLord> clicking display you can drag between 2 lists (and within list) clicking close and then display again , i lose ability to drag(sortable) of those lists
[11:48:25] <bkbarton> I have a "window" made from a transparent layer of hi z-index boxes. The window is an opening made by some empty space.
[11:48:47] <bkbarton> The layer has a opacity of 0.7
[11:49:08] <bkbarton> I would like the content to be visible under the z-index layer
[11:49:50] <bkbarton> and have the relevant info attached to the btn instance to be placed into the open 'window'.
[11:49:51] <sadmicrowave> PhanLord, you need to bind the dragging on a .live() event if you are going to remove the elements and re-add them.
[11:49:59] <bkbarton> Confused yet?
[11:50:19] <sadmicrowave> PhanLord,  it works the first time because the elements are part of the page DOM when the page is loaded, then you remove then and add them back in a live manner
[11:50:20] <jedimind_> i was born confused
[11:50:35] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, do you have an example?
[11:51:02] <bkbarton> Ah man... now yet. It's all in proto-type.
[11:51:07] <bkbarton> not yet
[11:51:07] <sadmicrowave> PhanLord, oh wait, nevermind...hold on
[11:51:32] <bkbarton> Thanks for your help, sadmicrowave.
[11:51:41] <PhanLord> i tryed calling desroy on clsoe of that popup and also calling refresh but nothign seems to be helping :(
[11:52:02] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, I don't think you are conveying what you want very well...leave out the stuff about opacity and transparent z-indexes and unicorns and other imaginary stuff and just tell me what you want the boxes to do when you click
[11:52:25] <bkbarton> ha ha
[11:52:45] <bkbarton> I guess I think it sounds simple, when it really isn't
[11:53:04] <sadmicrowave> well tell me what you think 'sounds simple'
[11:54:39] <bkbarton> There are 4 btns and 4 boxes. each btn corresponds to a box. when you press btn 4... the 4th box animates to where box 1 once was. press btn1 and the boxes animate back to box 1. This happens for each btn and box combo.
[11:54:53] <PhanLord> sadmicrowave and any ideas ? :)
[11:55:11] <sadmicrowave> PhanLord, still looking
[11:55:20] <MoTiOnXml> have got a weird issue with jQuery UI and effect/highlight in chrome and firefox; works fine in all versions of IE but nothing in the other browsers
[11:55:21] <MoTiOnXml> anyone?
[11:55:53] <Kambfhase> ?demo
[11:55:53] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:56:00] <MoTiOnXml> i have a working demo
[11:56:05] <MoTiOnXml> http://quotes.sphereworks.dk/
[11:56:18] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, but if all the boxes are positioned absolutely on top of each other then what and where are you animating?
[11:56:20] <MoTiOnXml> click the + og - links on top of each quote
[11:57:01] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: i'm sure i've got hold of the target element; length for the div.tools element is 1
[11:57:41] <bkbarton> Ah.... I might see the confusion.
[11:58:53] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, use nicknames when talking between people
[11:59:27] <sadmicrowave> that way I know you are talking to me
[12:00:16] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: getting an error from chrome console actually: uncaught TypeError: Object [object object] has no method 'effect'
[12:00:29] <Kambfhase> hmmm

[12:00:50] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: but i'm just calling .effect() on the first() jQuery object
[12:00:51] <bkbarton> sandmicrowave, boxes are not stacked on top... but positioned so they are one after another. example: each box= height:100px ... so the total height would be 400px.
[12:00:58] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: surely it should be extended
[12:01:20] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: Not the issue, but instead of parents(".tools").first() use .closest(".tools")

[12:01:55] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, thats what I asked earlier when I asked if you wanted them in a vertical row rather than horizontal
[12:01:57] <MoTiOnXml> noted; fixing now - ofcourse!
[12:02:11] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: alert(sender.closest(".tools").effect); says undefined
[12:02:13] <MoTiOnXml> o.O?
[12:02:53] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: while yet in all IE versions i'm getting the function contents

[12:03:30] <djQuery> alert sucks
[12:03:45] <MoTiOnXml> yea, but the chrome console reports same error
[12:03:50] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: what if you leave off the .effect
[12:04:23] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: and do what instead? i'm getting a nice response from the service in the callback; works fine
[12:04:45] <bkbarton> sadmicrowave: yes you did say..."like a vertical row instead of horizontal or positioned absolutely on top of each other?"
[12:04:56] <bkbarton> My bad.
[12:04:56] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: the JSON call works fine; i'd just like to animate the header with a blink once the response comes back
[12:05:24] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, so thats what you want then...give me a sec and we will see if I have it right this time
[12:05:58] <sadmicrowave> PhanLord, I'm still working on yours too by the way, I'm just not very familiar with sortable so it's taking me alittle bit
[12:06:23] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: jquery has no .effect method ;)
[12:06:30] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: just saw it ;)
[12:06:35] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:06:41] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: don't have jQuery UI on the page when in published mode :)
[12:06:44] <MoTiOnXml> omfg.
[12:06:48] * MoTiOnXml hides
[12:06:55] <sadmicrowave> bkbarton, is it ok if I just make the boxes animate to the center of the page and then animate back? or do you want them somewhere else?
[12:07:24] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: works fine now - you may try ;)
[12:07:49] <Kambfhase> hmm, reminds me of GBO
[12:07:55] <MoTiOnXml> GBO?
[12:07:56] <bkbarton> as long as I can follow the logic... you send them where ever you want. :0
[12:08:28] <Kambfhase> http://german-bash.org/action/random
[12:09:25] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: yea, we're using another quote system at the moment (the implementation is .. can't even mention), so i decided to spend a couple of hours re-implementing
[12:12:53] <PhanLord> sadmicrowave no problem i can wait a little longer :)
[12:14:34] <djQuery> ui.toggleclass I failed at this http://jsbin.com/oyahum/edit
[12:15:32] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: is there a quick way to increment or decrement a value represented as text for an element?
[12:15:38] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: or would i have to parse etc?
[12:18:35] <djQuery> var val = $('#myelem').val()++
[12:18:53] <djQuery> might blowed up if it is nan
[12:19:07] <Kambfhase> djQuery: toggleClass doesnt take a callback as an argument.
[12:19:08] <MoTiOnXml> thanks
[12:19:24] <djQuery> Kambfhase: doesnt work even if I leave that out
[12:20:07] <djQuery> Kambfhase: and if you look at the console the callback is being called
[12:20:35] <djQuery> ?ui.toggleclass
[12:20:35] <bot-t> Adds the specified class if it is not present, and removes the specified class if it is present, using an optional transition. http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggleClass/
[12:21:20] <Kambfhase> heel, yeah, nothin about a callback in the docs. thats why i am saying
[12:21:35] <djQuery> yeah noticed that myself
[12:22:00] <djQuery> woulda though this was a pretty simple example
[12:22:21] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/oyahum/2/edit
[12:24:00] <Kambfhase> animite, amirite?
[12:25:43] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: is it possible to run e.g. .effect async or will i have to .animate explicitly?
[12:26:08] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: in my case, if the user clicks + or - quickly, the browser queues up the calls
[12:26:43] <cpass> anyone tell me how I can fadeOut after .post ?

[12:39:47] <bkbarton> sadmicrowave: you've been a big help. Thank you and yr genius mind.
[12:39:48] <cpass> lol, cant i just do id.fadeOut()
[12:40:20] <djQuery> cpass: just do $this = $(this)   then in success do $this.fadeOut()
[12:41:05] <Aple> Is there way for slideUp to show rather than hide?
[12:41:27] <djQuery> cpass: also instead of doing $(this).id just do this.id
[12:42:51] <djQuery> Aple: toggleslide?
[12:43:04] <djQuery> then if its currently hidden it will show etc..
[12:43:45] <Aple> djQuery: Thanks. :)
[12:43:59] <Aple> djQuery: Possible to fadeIn at the same time?

[12:50:44] <Patabugen> Is there a selector which lets me get objects based on a css value they have?

[12:56:20] <PhanLord> crap i think tabs() si behaving same way as sortable, frist time it works 2nd time it doesnt want to switch tabs :( [no clue if that simple-modal plugin is at fault] http://jsfiddle.net/L2ns9/8/ (sortable() test)
[12:56:55] <desaiu> djQuery: What do I need to use to do that? I know I'll need to read the documentation, is this something basic?

[12:57:24] <djQuery> desaiu: go look up standfords cs101 course.
[12:57:45] <djQuery> desaiu: well it is in cs101
[12:58:06] <desaiu> djQuery: they go over drawing individual pixels on-screen?
[12:58:15] <djQuery> PhanLord: and if you allready using ui.tabs why not just use .dialog as well?
[12:58:26] <djQuery> desaiu: yes they do.

[13:33:51] <sadmicrowave> its great stuff, much better than modal in my opinion. but still doesn't solve the issue of the sortable lists being draggable
[13:34:23] <PhanLord> it does
[13:34:34] <PhanLord> for some reason if i dont use simple-modal it continues to be draggable :)
[13:35:23] <PhanLord> so tis possible that simple-modal is doing something that messes up with the state or something (when it clones div)
[13:35:37] <sadmicrowave> nicetry, made a few changes to your code, regardless of what you use though, incase you want to implement them....here they are...
[13:36:49] <sadmicrowave> PhanLord, http://jsfiddle.net/L2ns9/13/
[13:36:58] <PhanLord> thx
[13:37:26] <sadmicrowave> basically changed the extra line used for appending.  chaining .appendTo('#list1') to your entry element does the same thing and you don't have to re-call the selector again
[13:39:50] <djQuery> sadmicrowave: or better yet caching $list1 = $('#lsit1')    .appendTo($list1);
[13:40:04] <pen_> hey
[13:40:09] <pen_> how do I chain css3 animation with jquery?
[13:40:32] <pen_> like I have one with css transition and I want that transition to play out then I will maybe do something to the element like remove, detach etc
[13:40:34] <pen_> how do I do that
[13:40:47] <pen_> jquery execute everything so fast
[13:42:46] <pen_> anyone know?
[13:44:29] <juha___> ?addclass @ pen_
[13:44:29] <bot-t> pen_, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[13:45:02] <pen_> juha___, you sure you understand my question?
[13:45:31] <necromancer> is $('.class') faster than $('element.class')?
[13:48:02] <phlp> http://jsperf.com/jquery-class-vs-tag-qualfied-class-selector/2
[13:48:19] <sadmicrowave> djQuery, right, then you instead of referencing $('#list1') all over the place just reference $list1 variable
[13:48:40] <sadmicrowave> geez I can't type today
[13:49:30] <m0dmd> Hi everyone!
[13:52:08] <bl4ckcomb`> hi, i'm storing my html templates (to be used in $.template()) in separate files. is there some widely used extension for jquery html templates (like phtml for html templates for php)?
[13:52:35] <Klevre> http://klevre.nihplod.com/project/marketa/ -- any idea why the scrolling kinda lags?
[13:55:03] <dabear> Klevre: no lag in chrome
[13:55:11] <dabear> firefox, however, is another story
[13:55:30] <Klevre> can that be fixed?
[13:55:50] <phishbot> anyone ever have problems with passing in variables to .animate()?
[13:55:58] <phishbot> in the opts parameter
[13:56:32] <Klevre> dabear: I see a sort of tearing effect on chrome too
[13:57:19] <dabear> scrollto plugin last updated in 2009?
[13:57:25] <dabear> find another plugin :p
[14:09:10] <bfred> I want to move the children of element A to element B. is this correct? A.contents().appendTo(B)
[14:22:38] <dabear> bfred: use .children() rather than .contents()
[14:23:20] <gnarf> .contents() should do the same and also get bare textnodes
[14:27:23] <amites> Any ideas why a 1 out of 4 .js files would not appear as being loaded in firebug console? I've run the code from the file and it works correctly
[14:30:43] <caz> Hi, I got a litle problem. How can I find href value within this instruction : $("#pages").find("#facet li a")? I tried with : .filter("my_href") but that does not work. Any ideas?
[14:31:28] <bfred> dabear: thanks!
[14:33:31] <dabear> caz: .filter("[href=my_href]")
[14:34:43] <caz> thank you dabear
[14:35:34] <caz> dabear: that does not work :(
[14:36:02] <dabear> it does
[14:36:08] <dabear> your doing it wrong
[14:36:31] <dabear> also, define "find" as per your question
[14:37:48] <caz> dabear: ok i'll try again :)
[14:38:56] <Es0teric> jquery ui autocomplete is not working for me for some reason...
[14:39:01] <Es0teric> how do i make it work?
[14:41:34] * MrNibbles congratulates Es0teric for showing everyone how not to ask a question
[14:42:10] <misterm> Es0teric: have you tried turning it off and then on again?
[14:42:26] <Es0teric> thanks, MrNibbles... whats my prize?
[14:42:59] <Es0teric> misterm, yes i have
[14:43:31] <misterm> welp, Im out of ideas then
[14:43:55] <Es0teric> for some reason, the autocomplete breaks the rest of the js on the page...
[14:43:57] <Es0teric> its wierd
[14:44:15] <versatiletech> Es0teric: have a public link to share?
[14:44:35] <misterm> not neccesarily, it's pretty easy for errors in what part of your script to interfere with others
[14:45:28] <versatiletech> it's easier to help you when we can actually look at what you're working with. It usually is something stupid simple.
[14:45:41] <Es0teric> versatiletech, i will provide a link on pastie.. just a sec
[14:46:58] <pen_> hey
[14:47:18] <pen_> what does it mean to have zero jquery element? does it mean I can do if (elem) check?
[14:47:22] <pen_> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:47:36] <pen_> it says closest will return zero or one elements
[14:49:12] <Es0teric> versatiletech -> http://pastie.org/2204036
[14:49:49] <Es0teric> if i do it with .autocomplete({source:data}); it would just return and error... idk why
[14:57:12] <bnjmn> what's the best way to select all input elements that are type submit OR type button?
[14:59:13] <versatiletech> Es0teric: include the autocomplete plugin and jquery. Use jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com to be able to debug this quickly.
[15:01:11] <misterm> pen_: you can do if ( $(selector).length ) to see if a query is returning results
[15:01:19] <pen_> misterm, ok cool thanks
[15:01:30] <bnjmn> is there any way to combine two selections?
[15:03:20] <misterm> bnjmn: do you mean selectors? or selections of something?
[15:03:31] <bnjmn> yea selectors
[15:03:32] <amites> Could someone please post a pastebin of the .js file at http://bit.ly/pg5DGr -- I think that it's being cached by my ISP since the FTP reflects a different version that I'm receiving.
[15:03:58] <misterm> bnjmn: then yes, multiple ways, depending on what you want
[15:04:12] <bnjmn> i want all input elements that are either type submit or type button
[15:05:07] <lenswipe> hey guys
[15:05:24] <lenswipe> there was someone in here that helped me with a load of DB stuff, only i cant remember what you're called - are you about?
[15:06:06] <Es0teric> versatiletech, how do i debug it when i cant tell what the problem is? not even firebug tells me
[15:06:55] <versatiletech> no, paste in your code in jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net including jquery, autocomplete, and your code so that I could debug it
[15:07:50] <Es0teric> versatiletech... ohh i see alright
[15:07:57] <ajpiano> bnjmn $(".foo,.bar") or $(".foo").add(".bar")
[15:08:10] <bnjmn> ahhh great thanks
[15:08:37] <mangos> how can i make it so a dropdown list only drops down when clicked, and when the mouse hovers away from the list, it hides?
[15:10:37] <LakWork> mangos you make something that isnt a dropdownlist, but looks like one. I.e. div element wrapping a UL which is displayed when the div is activated
[15:13:29] <mangos> LakWork: http://pastebin.com/eGeg3GTM
[15:13:32] <mangos> this is what i have at the moment
[15:14:05] <mangos> but instead of hover, i'd like it to be click, if you understand
[15:14:19] <mangos> if i change it to click, it works, but it wont hide if you mouse away from the list
[15:14:32] <lenswipe> try .blur
[15:14:44] <Es0teric> versatiletech -> http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/
[15:15:06] <LakWork> i dont think blur will work on a div
[15:15:08] <LakWork> I could be wron
[15:15:22] <LakWork> g*
[15:16:06] <mangos> doesnt work
[15:16:43] <LakWork> try .leave()
[15:17:14] <mangos> you mean replace click with leave?
[15:17:31] <mangos> or use leave to hide
[15:18:46] <LakWork> leave to hide
[15:20:45] <DroMastaP`Fr> hey guys
[15:20:47] <DroMastaP`Fr> http://pastebin.com/2nJF3NtV
[15:21:03] <DroMastaP`Fr> i'm noob, but it doesn't work
[15:21:11] <DroMastaP`Fr> am I on a good way ?
[15:30:47] <versatiletech> Es0teric: in the HTML window you'll have to include the complete HTML including the <html>, <head>, and <body> tag. Also, add in the script tag to point to a public version of the autocomplete script. In the Javascript window only put in javascript without the <script> tag.
[15:32:56] <sadmicrowave> 7L & Es0teric ?
[15:33:10] <Es0teric> sadmicrowave, that is correct
[15:33:19] <sadmicrowave> thats the shit
[15:35:15] <bobbobbins> is there a way to do the reverse of this: 		settings = $.extend({}, settings, options);
[15:36:25] <Es0teric> versatiletech -> http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/1/ is that better?
[15:36:37] <Es0teric> yep, sadmicrowave.. it is... especially army of the pharaohs
[15:38:03] <Es0teric> versatiletech *updated* w/ doctype http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/2/
[15:38:22] <DroMastaP`Fr> anyone to help me, it's a newbie question, this doesn't work, any idea ?  http://pastebin.com/2nJF3NtV
[15:42:26] <GeoDud> @DroMasta you are overwriting the etat_footer variable
[15:43:27] <DroMastaP`Fr> @GeoDud this is what I want to do, to have two different states for mhy objets, but I think it's the complicated solution no ? :x
[15:44:07] <GeoDud> you are not changing the original variable, you are creating a new one in each statement
[15:44:23] <DroMastaP`Fr> I want, when I click on my div, she move up and stop, and when I clic again, just go back
[15:44:26] <DroMastaP`Fr> mmhh...
[15:44:29] <Zzaichik> .toggle();
[15:44:53] <GeoDud> etat_footer = true;, not var etat_footer = true;
[15:45:03] <DroMastaP`Fr> yeah..
[15:45:06] <DroMastaP`Fr> I see ^^
[15:45:41] <DroMastaP`Fr> but is my syntax good ?
[15:45:50] <DroMastaP`Fr> I think no :x
[15:45:58] <versatiletech> Es0teric: well first error is that you're trying to use the split method on an Array object not a String object
[15:46:05] <DroMastaP`Fr> my "if" doesn't work
[15:46:36] <Zzaichik> DroMastaP`Fr: does 'bottom' need quotes? -> bottom: '250px'
[15:46:55] <GeoDud> if (!etat_footer) { dosomething():} else { //true}
[15:47:24] <DroMastaP`Fr> where did u see that Zzaichik ?
[15:47:33] <DroMastaP`Fr> my bottom have quotes :)
[15:47:45] <DroMastaP`Fr> work perfectly now !
[15:47:50] <DroMastaP`Fr> if (etat_footer == 0){
[15:47:52] <DroMastaP`Fr> work nice
[15:48:30] <DroMastaP`Fr> I don't need to put a $ before, cause its not a jQuery object ( i think )
[15:48:35] <GeoDud> yes
[15:48:39] <Es0teric> ohhh ok, so how do i make that work, versatiletech?
[15:49:04] <DroMastaP`Fr> Thanks you guys, very nice to be helped sometimes, thanks for ur time
[15:49:45] <Es0teric> that was funny... dude said "my if doesnt work"
[15:49:47] <Es0teric> lmao
[15:49:47] <versatiletech> Es0teric: remove the split method
[15:50:12] <versatiletech> then you'll be able to search through those strings
[15:50:23] <Es0teric> versatiletech, it still doesnt work...
[15:50:51] <versatiletech> http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/3/
[15:51:03] <Pilate> did the jquery animate method change in the last few versions? it seems like its using requestanimationframe now since it doesnt update when the tab is inactive
[15:51:14] <versatiletech> I just removed the split method and it's working
[15:52:51] <DroMastaP`Fr> I go to sleep, 1am here, have a good day/night
[15:52:54] <DroMastaP`Fr> +++
[15:53:01] <Es0teric> versatiletech, it doesnt work now because i have a php code in there... are you good with php?
[15:53:20] <versatiletech> yes
[15:53:33] <versatiletech> Es0teric: could you update you're example then? I
[15:53:53] <versatiletech> I'm working with an array that says Bird, Plane, Rock... and it's working
[15:54:11] <Es0teric> good, well heres the new code http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/5/
[15:55:17] <Es0teric> did you get that, versatiletech?
[15:55:51] <draginx> Any idea how I can make an ajax load to an image and while its loading pop up a load msg and then once it's done loading remove the loading message?
[15:56:07] <draginx> I know how to do the loading message just need to figure out how I can load images really =/
[15:57:17] <draginx> http://pastie.org/private/gbvkgadhrorxjuq7jppofq here's my attempt
[15:59:25] <versatiletech> Es0teric: you should include the output of PHP, not the actually PHP code, unless you want the PHP code to be searchable, not the HTML that it outputs. jsfiddle.net, nor jsbin.com, evaluate PHP. It's best to copying your code by viewing the source in your browser http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=75129
[16:00:30] <draginx> or better yet, does IE6 support new Image(); ? O_o
[16:00:54] <Es0teric> versatiletech, the php output is the same as "bird", "plane" etc
[16:01:18] <versatiletech> yeah, view source and paste that in
[16:01:25] <versatiletech> jsfiddle.net
[16:09:58] <versatiletech> draginx: IE6 definitely supports new Image() I just used it on a project. What are you trying to do?
[16:10:18] <draginx> versatiletech: nvm my script works then :)
[16:10:34] <draginx> I was trying to load images using ajax calls and was having a hard time doing it without new Image();
[16:10:49] <draginx> someone told me that it *wasnt* supported in IE (not even in 6 just IE :P)
[16:10:50] <Es0teric> versatiletech, it will work with just the plain version of it.. no dynamic stuff at all
[16:11:05] <Es0teric> but i am trying to make it work with the php code so the information can change dynamically
[16:11:16] <fructose> Why might newdiv.html(data) cause JavaScript to 'abort'? If I try and trace it through Firebug, it doesn't break on the line after, and there is no indication of error
[16:11:17] <versatiletech> you can't assume it works in IE6 until you actually test it. Have you tested it?
[16:12:36] <draginx> versatiletech: i have zero way o fknowing tbh
[16:12:39] <draginx> i dont have a windows machine
[16:12:43] <draginx> nor a vm with windows on it
[16:12:55] <versatiletech> Es0teric: have you tried serving the results in JSON format?
[16:13:08] <draginx> i am very anti MSFT ;)
[16:13:17] <Es0teric> versatiletech, i have NO idea how to work with json.. lol
[16:13:19] <versatiletech> draginx: Microsoft provides free VMs with IE
[16:13:27] <draginx> versatiletech: where?!
[16:13:58] <versatiletech> draginx: do you have any VM client?
[16:14:10] <draginx> Parralels I believe..
[16:14:18] <draginx> yup
[16:14:20] <versatiletech> great
[16:14:24] <versatiletech> I have Parallels too
[16:14:37] <versatiletech> http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11575
[16:14:52] <versatiletech> just download the Windows_XP_IE6.exe
[16:14:57] <draginx> â¦.oâ¦...m...g
[16:15:08] <draginx> How did I not know this? :O
[16:15:13] <draginx> thanks :)
[16:15:27] <draginx> wait a minute this is an exe..
[16:15:30] <versatiletech> only those who search for gold will find it
[16:15:31] <versatiletech> lol
[16:15:33] <draginx> wtf do i do with an exe? I dont have windows lol
[16:15:54] <Klevre> well you can whine
[16:16:07] <versatiletech> eh well have you thought about something that could uncompress an exe on Mac?
[16:16:09] <draginx> Klevre: like thats going to work (whine is pretty crappy no offence to the devs)
[16:16:10] <draginx> offense*
[16:16:58] <versatiletech> oh wait that exists
[16:17:00] <versatiletech> http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html
[16:17:05] <versatiletech> ;)
[16:17:07] <draginx> have it
[16:17:21] <versatiletech> good
[16:18:24] <versatiletech> now I believe you have to convert the VHDs using the command line
[16:18:33] <versatiletech> but I forgot how I did that
[16:19:00] <Es0teric> versatiletech how do i
[16:19:14] <Es0teric> display the data via json?
[16:19:17] <Es0teric> so it can autocomplete?
[16:19:25] <versatiletech> use a json php library
[16:19:40] <versatiletech> I think php 5.2+ has json built in
[16:20:27] <versatiletech> http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[16:26:53] <sherjilozair> Hey
[16:27:10] <sherjilozair> How do I ask the console to give me the array in a JS script
[16:27:11] <sherjilozair> ?
[16:27:37] <draginx> versatiletech: https://browserlab.adobe.com until april 2012 this is prob better ;)
[16:27:37] <versatiletech> console.log( myarray );
[16:27:50] <sherjilozair> I want to check out the contents of a javascript array in google chrome's developers
[16:27:57] <versatiletech> draginx: nope, nothing better than instantaneous updates
[16:28:01] <draginx> lol
[16:28:02] <versatiletech> browserlab is slow
[16:28:38] <sherjilozair> versatiletech: Thanks a bunch ! It worked. :)
[16:29:06] <draginx> o wow browserlab does suck =x
[16:29:27] <versatiletech> comeon you can't be that lazy!! Unless you want to pull your hair out waiting 30 seconds+ to see just one update when you could do at least 10 refreshes on a live IE browser in 30 seconds :D
[16:29:39] <draginx> lol
[16:30:58] <versatiletech> http://finalbuilds.com/iecollection.htm
[16:33:02] <draginx> my parallels is crapping out..
[16:38:54] <versatiletech> draginx: so when you get the VM up and running use IE collection to install IE6-8 with developer goodies preinstalled :D
[16:39:09] <draginx> lol k
[16:39:13] <draginx> i tihnk im just gonna go with vhd
[16:41:02] <klj613> if i have a object instance. how can i find out what it is a instance of?
[16:45:36] <versatiletech> klj613: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/instanceof
[16:46:11] <versatiletech> does #jquery have any bots?
[16:47:37] <KingDosser> How do I animate an element (which has content that is variable) that has an initial height of 0 and a display of none to be visible with its full height?
[16:49:27] <versatiletech> KingDosser: It's probably best to have a wrapper div or any other block level element that contracts and expands. That might possibly be a solution.
[16:51:27] <KingDosser> versatiletech : Cant i make this element contract and expand?
[16:51:47] <KingDosser> It does have display block, but i removed it to make it invisible initially
[16:55:23] <versatiletech> KingDosser: http://jsbin.com/asejak/2/edit#source
[16:56:29] <KingDosser> versatiletech: Does it have to be wrapped?
[16:57:39] <versatiletech> don't quote me on this, but it's one of the easiest way to deal with variable content
[17:01:44] <sherjilozair> How does one test ajax ?
[17:01:55] <versatiletech> use firebug
[17:01:58] <KingDosser> Okay cheers versatiletech, what is the return false for?
[17:02:07] <versatiletech> and the Net tab
[17:02:09] <Pio> if i want to fetch two documents via ajax, then after both documents are fetched run some function, is there a cleaner way to code it besides just chaining up the ajax calls in the success handler function?
[17:02:11] <sherjilozair> I'm working on localhost, and it says, that orgin can't access the url I'm giving.
[17:02:15] <sherjilozair> I'm on chrome.
[17:02:48] <versatiletech> sherjilozair: try jsonp. Sounds like a cross domain issue.
[17:03:10] <sherjilozair> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins=asd&destinations=asd&mode=driving&language=en-EN&sensor=false. Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[17:03:12] <versatiletech> KingDosser: that's to prevent the link from firing it's normal event
[17:03:29] <KingDosser> Oh okay sweet as versatiletech, already doing that in my script :)
[17:04:03] <Pio> nevermind, it was right there in the .get docs
[17:04:08] <versatiletech> KingDosser: yeah it's the same as http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[17:04:18] <KingDosser> yeah :)
[17:04:24] <sherjilozair> versatiletech: Are you guys able to use jquery's ajax from localhost and call a google url ?
[17:05:11] <Es0teric> versatiletech, how would i... use json_encode for the search though? i dont get it
[17:05:20] <versatiletech> :/
[17:05:33] <versatiletech> you feed json_encode an array
[17:05:51] <versatiletech> that array would be filled with strings
[17:06:02] <versatiletech> those strings will come from your DB
[17:06:08] <versatiletech> possibly MySQL
[17:06:37] <versatiletech> then you echo the result of json_encode
[17:07:02] <versatiletech> echo json_encode( array( 'string1', 'string2') );
[17:08:29] <versatiletech> $('#myautocomplete').autocomplete( {source: 'path/to/my/php/file/with/json_encode.php'} );
[17:15:10] <KingDosser> versatiletech: http://pastie.org/private/fcmrlav65yb6no4u0g6q5w This is succesful in showing but not hiding.
[17:15:30] <Es0teric> versatiletech, so what you're saying is that if the php query i created is stored in a variable like $thedbvar
[17:15:50] <Es0teric> all i would have to do is do json_encode($thedbvar);?
[17:21:21] <versatiletech> well assuming that $thedbvar is structured as an array with only strings, not anything else like column names and such, so you end up with an array that looks similar to array('string1', 'string2')
[17:21:37] <versatiletech> then yes, that's what I mean
[17:22:56] <sherjilozair> versatiletech: Should I just add a "dataType: 'jsonp'" to $.ajax ?
[17:23:04] <sherjilozair> versatiletech: Or something else ?
[17:23:17] <Es0teric> versatiletech, you know that the foreach echos the results from the db query...
[17:26:59] <sherjilozair> I'm getting a "Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type application/json."
[17:27:03] <sherjilozair> when I use jsonp
[17:27:11] <sherjilozair> I think I'm using it the wrong way.
[17:28:54] <versatiletech> Es0teric: you could do a foreach to populate a new array with strings coming from the DB, and then feed that array to json_encode and echo the result of json_encode. I'll leave it there. The rest will be your homework. ;)
[17:31:14] <sherjilozair> versatiletech: Is my question too noobish ?
[17:31:55] <versatiletech> google cross domain jquery. You'll find a lot of examples.
[17:39:39] <Es0teric> versatiletech -> http://pastie.org/2204690
[17:40:05] <sherjilozair> versatiletech: No luck. :(
[17:40:49] <Es0teric> sherjilozair, he left =_=
[17:52:41] <sherjilozair> Can anyone help me with cross domain ajax using jquery ?
[17:53:13] <snover> ?w same-origin policy @ sherjilozair
[17:55:00] <sherjilozair> snover: what do you mean ?
[17:55:23] <snover> bot-t: you are such a fuck
[17:55:24] <bot-t> snover, Is that a question?
[17:55:27] <snover> ?w same-origin policy @ sherjilozair
[17:55:41] <snover> ?g wikipedia same-origin policy @ sherjilozair
[17:55:43] <bot-t> sherjilozair, Same origin policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[17:56:14] <sherjilozair> I don't know about the same origin policy, but yeah, the site im trying to get a json
[17:56:17] <sherjilozair> is restricted.
[17:56:55] <sherjilozair> snover: I read the wiki, I understand that js has the same origin policy.
[17:57:07] <sherjilozair> Does that mean I can't do cross domain ajax ?
[17:57:09] <snover> sherjilozair: yes.
[17:57:44] <sherjilozair> How can that be ? I've seen websites which do that.
[17:58:02] <BuckarooBonzai> Question on $.serialize()... why is it emitting checkbox=on?
[17:58:22] <BuckarooBonzai> serialize()
[17:58:40] <snover> those websites which do that are not trying to get it from places that donât allow it :)
[17:59:23] <sherjilozair> The website I'm trying to do with is a google api, so they should have ajax supported right ? Or wrong ?
[18:00:01] <sherjilozair> If I cant ajax, then what are other methods to get a json from a url ?
[18:00:17] <snover> sherjilozair: READ. ARTICLE.
[18:11:29] <melusinechan> i'd like to add a listener on dialog to allow the user when he press space, to display the text no displayed yet or to close the dialog. What is the best way and where to handle the event of the space key ?
[18:24:44] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/fcmrlav65yb6no4u0g6q5w This is succesful in showing but not hiding. Any ideas?
[18:25:43] <coldhead> you're not quoting left-slate-div
[18:26:03] <coldhead> but you could also use $(this) instead
[18:26:06] <coldhead> in the inner fn
[18:26:17] <Es0teric> i am having a problem with autocomplete with jquery ui... and this is agitating me
[18:26:19] <Es0teric> =_=
[18:26:44] <coldhead> autocompleting is hard :(
[18:27:05] <ryanseddon> coldhead: wouldn't this be the window object since it's inside a setTimeout?
[18:27:51] <coldhead> oh yes
[18:28:05] <coldhead> sharp as a whip, ryanseddon
[18:28:24] <Es0teric> http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/5/ <-- this is my autocomplete problem...
[18:28:32] <ryanseddon> whips are floppy?
[18:28:45] <coldhead> sharp as a tack
[18:28:52] <ryanseddon> thats better ;)
[18:29:30] <eric_lewis> is this incorrect syntax? var parsed = jq.parseJSON( response );
[18:29:56] <eric_lewis> it's crashing my javascript for some reason
[18:33:00] <Es0teric> can someone help me with my problem real quick?
[18:44:48] <Funcod> ,seen paul_irish
[18:44:50] <eric_lewis> is there a jquery method to convert a string with things like "\n" and "<\/div>" to an actual linebreak and </div>?
[18:46:11] <snover> wat?
[18:48:17] <eric_lewis> should i repeat myself?
[18:48:23] <KingDosser> Hey coldhead. It still doesn't work. :(
[18:48:27] <eric_lewis> i have this JSON string that for some reason the .parseJSON method isn't working on
[18:48:46] <snover> is it actually valid json?
[18:48:48] <snover> http://jsonlint.com
[18:49:34] <eric_lewis> oh siht
[18:49:40] <eric_lewis> snover you the shit
[19:00:53] <sam350> ShawnRisk hi
[19:05:21] <Kichael> hello, I'm using http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#json plugin, in firebug my response is the proper json response, but my success function isn't firing, any ideas?
[19:07:39] <Kichael> I think I got it actually, never mind ^.^, was binding the options instead of just including them
[19:16:04] <mixmasterxp> whats the proper way to delay an ajax call after triggering a keyup event for an autocomplete box?
[19:16:08] <mixmasterxp> i'm making my own
[19:39:07] <ch3mical> Nested callbacks sure are fun!
[19:54:40] <endy_c> how can I select using the text between the <a>? example: <a href="...">this</a>, I want to get the <a> that the text inside is "this"
[19:56:35] <rogeruiz> Hey all
[19:59:00] <rogeruiz> I have a question about object literals versus inheritance in jQ. Does jQ have a way to use inheritance built in? I've only heard of the elfin extends but never really used it. I've only seen it in plugin implementation.
[20:00:26] <rogeruiz> Effin'
[20:07:27] <Mat0> Hi , I'm trying to run some jquery commands in firebug on a Drupal page where I can see that jquery gets loaded. So it should be there, but every time I run something as simple as $("p").hide(); I get this: -- TypeError: $("p") is null -- in firebug; I don't understand what the problem is. Any suggestion?
[20:08:36] <nnisi> try jQuery('p');
[20:10:35] <Assimilater> how does jquery hide elements with the .hide()?
[20:10:42] <Mat0> nnisi: it works thanks
[20:11:04] <rogeruiz> I think it changes display to none
[20:11:05] <nnisi> np
[20:11:12] <rogeruiz> But im bot exactly sire
[20:11:17] <rogeruiz> Sure*
[20:11:18] <Mat0> still why is it not working with $?
[20:11:43] <rewt> maybe another lib grabbed $
[20:12:05] <coldhead> ?source hide
[20:12:05] <bot-t> Line#7471 - "hide: function( speed, easing, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#7471
[20:12:32] <Assimilater> if you look at the p.neat on http://jquery.com/
[20:12:41] <Assimilater> this is on old jquery so .prop doesn't exist
[20:12:44] <Mat0> maybe...
[20:12:47] <Assimilater> .attr('display') is undefined
[20:13:55] <Assimilater> long run i'm trying to make a check for if an object is currently hidden
[20:14:37] <Mat0> Is there a way to find out quickly which other library might have grabbed $?
[20:14:45] <coldhead> ?visible @ Assimilater
[20:14:46] <bot-t> Assimilater, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[20:14:53] <coldhead> is(':visible')
[20:15:02] <coldhead> ?cc
[20:15:03] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[20:15:51] <hobs> why is he mad about that
[20:15:56] <Assimilater> idk
[20:15:58] <Assimilater> thanks cold
[20:16:00] <hobs> id think a case closed is another job well done
[20:16:08] <hobs> well bot-t isnt a man Assimilater
[20:16:13] <hobs> so its why did his programmer get mad
[20:16:29] <Assimilater> all i said was idk....
[20:16:30] <coldhead> maybe it's not anger so much as steely determination
[20:16:30] <Assimilater> sheesh
[20:16:37] <coldhead> like ripley in aliens
[20:16:50] <coldhead> when she bags another alien she's like >: |
[20:16:54] <coldhead> and it's still a job well done
[20:17:02] <hobs> yeah I was thinking it might just be ambivalence too, like a true neutral man
[20:17:11] <hobs> his eyebrows furrowed in working on the case
[20:17:22] <hobs> same deal
[20:17:44] <coldhead> that works for me too
[20:17:50] <KingDosser> Hey Guys
[20:18:12] <coldhead> hey KD
[20:19:11] <Assimilater> anyone want to explain this to me? I think my question got quietly ignored :/ http://forum.jquery.com/topic/hasattr
[20:19:21] <Assimilater> if there's a valid reason i don't get it
[20:19:27] <Assimilater> and no one is talking on forums it seems
[20:22:02] <coldhead> jQuery's brightest and best made their cases in those tickets
[20:22:18] <Assimilater> :S
[20:22:30] <coldhead> but the main point is that it's not necessary and you can easily add it yourself
[20:22:53] <coldhead> jQuery has a nice plugin architecture just so it doesn't have to include everything in core
[20:23:14] <coldhead> and it would rather be a small userful lib that you can customise
[20:23:15] <Assimilater> then have have hasClass?
[20:23:19] <coldhead> than a giant do everything for you
[20:23:33] <coldhead> than*
[20:23:34] <Assimilater> wc/have/why
[20:23:38] <Assimilater> and yes
[20:23:41] <Assimilater> s/then/than
[20:23:42] <coldhead> ?hasclass
[20:23:43] <bot-t> .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[20:23:44] <Assimilater> i'm tired, lol
[20:23:59] <coldhead> hmm, you should move to have that removed
[20:24:05] <Assimilater> why not just .is('.class')
[20:24:09] <Assimilater> by the same argument
[20:24:11] <coldhead> i guess class is more selectory
[20:24:23] <coldhead> than attributes
[20:24:28] <coldhead> but i agree it's inconsistent
[20:24:28] <Assimilater> i like hasClass personally, just saying
[20:24:33] <coldhead> ajpiano?
[20:24:36] <coldhead> ur thoguts?
[20:25:12] <coldhead> Assimilater: if you want it, just use rwaldron's gist
[20:25:25] <Assimilater> coldhead: i prefer my own, less code :P
[20:25:27] <coldhead> people don't add their own extensions enough
[20:25:37] <coldhead> right well that too
[20:25:55] <coldhead> i have a coldhead.jquery.js that gives me lots of special goodness
[20:26:07] <Assimilater> i should do that...
[20:26:10] <Assimilater> haha
[20:26:29] <Assimilater> i'll add my new addition: $.fn.Visible = function() { return this.is(':visible'); };
[20:26:36] <KingDosser> Hows it going coldhead/ :)
[20:26:49] <sphinxxx> anyone know how, in jquery slide viewerpro plugin, to get the autoslide to stop on the last slide?
[20:26:53] <uf0> what is this  ~  ? in mac os x
[20:26:58] <sphinxxx> http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/index.html
[20:27:00] <uf0> i'm trying to create a ssh config file
[20:27:01] <coldhead> adequately thx KingDosser
[20:27:13] <uf0> have no idea what ~/.ssh/config
[20:27:24] <uf0> this ~
[20:28:07] <ajpiano> uf0: it's your home directory
[20:28:18] <coldhead> /home/uf0
[20:28:23] <coldhead> /Users/uf0
[20:28:32] <coldhead> somie lie dat
[20:28:41] <uf0> ahh
[20:28:46] <coldhead> A:\MYFILES\
[20:29:05] <uf0> so is that a shortcut to note write it out completely then?
[20:29:43] <ajpiano> yes
[20:29:50] <coldhead> if you have a good operating system it will expand it for you
[20:29:56] <coldhead> but you probably don't
[20:29:56] <ajpiano> every user has a home directory on like, unix based os, which osx
[20:29:58] <ajpiano> is
[20:30:31] <uf0> coldhead: i have mac os x lol
[20:30:36] <uf0> i guess that's a bad os
[20:30:48] <uf0> but understood
[20:31:09] <coldhead> os X should expand it for you!
[20:31:54] <uf0> cool, i was a windows person so slowly learning this here :)
[20:32:16] <uf0> i had putty so now just trying to create ssh config file
[20:32:22] <uf0> was the reasoning behind it
[20:32:31] <coldhead> why are you asking in #jQuery?
[20:32:44] <ajpiano> cause computers, duh
[20:32:49] <uf0> lol yea.
[20:32:55] <uf0> cuz you guys are geniuses
[20:32:59] <uf0> and devs
[20:33:09] <coldhead> #jQuery == "Just Queries"
[20:33:11] <coldhead> got it
[20:33:16] <ajpiano> no idiot
[20:33:20] <ajpiano> it stands for
[20:33:22] <ajpiano> Jeneral Queries
[20:33:34] <uf0> bingo
[20:35:34] <toddnine> Hi guys.  I'm trying to use google closure with wro4j and my maven build process
[20:35:35] <toddnine> http://code.google.com/p/wro4j/wiki/MavenPluginWithYuiOrGoogleClosure
[20:36:15] <ajpiano> toddnine, in what way does this concern jQuery :p
[20:37:19] <toddnine> I've defined my js files in the following order for compression.  https://gist.github.com/c24e738c5e760e5ab82c  However when I compress, my scripts now receive errors that $ is undefined.  I have 2 questions.  1 does the order of compression matter for jQuery to work?  2, it is even possbile to compress jquery and the plugins we use into a single js file with our javascript?
[20:37:45] <ajpiano> yes, it is abundantly possible to do #2
[20:38:06] <toddnine> ajpiano: Any suggestions?  YUI didn't seem to work either
[20:38:12] <ajpiano> the answer to #1 is yes, you typically want jQuery core and ui loaded before you load stuff that depends on them
[20:38:26] <toddnine> Yeah, take a look at the gist
[20:38:34] <toddnine> I put those 2 first, then I add all our plugins
[20:38:40] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm looking
[20:38:41] <dokma> hey guyz... I've read somewhere that :   if (jQuery) is bad because when jQuery is not defined it will cause a js error
[20:38:49] <dokma> what is the correct way?
[20:38:52] <coldhead> if i screenshot this rash i have on my naughty bits can i get some Jeneral Advice on it?
[20:39:02] <ajpiano> i'm completely unfamiliar with maven and wroj4 or whatnot
[20:39:14] <ajpiano> toddnine, if you can paste the actual output from the compiled js
[20:39:19] <ajpiano> it would perhaps be easier to diagnose
[20:39:20] <toddnine> ajpiano: It's basically just a wrapper around google closure
[20:39:27] <ajpiano> or a live demo of the page
[20:39:30] <ajpiano> where your'e getting the errors
[20:39:34] <coldhead> dokma: if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined')
[20:39:46] <ajpiano> dokma: that's not true.  if (completelyundefinedthing) does not throw errors
[20:39:55] <toddnine> ajpiano: https://gist.github.com/c24e738c5e760e5ab82c
[20:40:14] <dokma> ajpiano: are you sure? I'm a js noob
[20:40:31] <toddnine> Don't have a live demo yet, the build wont' run because the selenium tests don't pass due to the JS and CSS not working properly
[20:40:33] <coldhead> me too, dokma
[20:40:37] <coldhead> do what ajpiano says
[20:40:52] <dokma> so I just leave it the way it is
[20:40:53] <dokma> ok
[20:40:55] <ajpiano> ?eval if (foo) { "foo"; } else { "bar"; }
[20:40:55] <bot-t> ajpiano: ReferenceError: foo is not defined
[20:40:59] <ajpiano> lol
[20:41:18] <coldhead> wtf ajpiano
[20:41:22] <ajpiano> dokma: best would be to do to
[20:41:25] <ajpiano> if (window.jQuery)
[20:42:11] <dokma> ajpiano: how is that better than if (jQuery) ?
[20:42:47] <ajpiano> it's more explicit
[20:43:06] <coldhead> like inner labia
[20:43:14] <coldhead> ?
[20:43:37] <ajpiano> sorta
[20:43:44] <dokma> I see... there's this thing in the code of a context menu plugin that I do not uderstand
[20:43:50] <ajpiano> dokma, as you can see, the approach of testing window.jQuery is used in html5boilerplate
[20:43:53] <ajpiano> https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L54
[20:44:08] <dokma> the code is rather simple but I do not get what does the last jQuery in braces does in this code:
[20:44:09] <ajpiano> toddnine: i take back what i said about it being possible to tell from the output :p
[20:44:34] <coldhead> ?eval if (window.aids) {}
[20:44:35] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[20:44:44] <coldhead> ?eval if (window.jQuery) {}
[20:44:44] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[20:44:48] <dokma> if(jQuery)( function() { $.extend($.fn, { bunch of functions here }); })(jQuery);
[20:45:04] <ajpiano> lol, in that particular example, it's useless
[20:45:08] <ajpiano> but the patttern is described here
[20:45:09] <dokma> what does that last (jQuery) does?
[20:45:15] <ajpiano> ?iife @ dokma
[20:45:15] <bot-t> dokma, http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[20:45:25] <dokma> great! thanks
[20:45:36] <ajpiano> it's passing jQuery into an anonymous function as an argument
[21:00:55] <iszak> coldhead where have you been?!
[21:01:02] <coldhead> working!
[21:01:10] <iszak> oh right, ha.
[21:01:13] <iszak> at work atm?
[21:01:46] <sonuloveu> good morning magento :)
[21:01:52] <iszak> this is jquery!
[21:02:21] <sonuloveu> dang
[21:02:28] <sonuloveu> just got up :(
[21:02:40] <coldhead> iszak: oui
[21:02:40] <iszak> now if you say it in #magento it'll look like I'm a mind reader as I've already said good morning in #magento
[21:02:47] <iszak> coldhead, I've got a video for you :(
[21:05:48] <sphinxxx> anyone know how to stop slideshow on last slide on this: http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/index.html
[21:06:13] <coldhead> iszak: link anyway, i'll get to it
[21:06:23] <iszak> i'll PM
[21:06:25] <Assimilater> ajpiano: did you by chance notice the above convo me and coldhead had?
[21:07:53] <ajpiano> Assimilater: a) hasClass is a shortcut to .isClass
[21:08:04] <ajpiano> b) an element can have multiple classes
[21:08:19] <ajpiano> so being able to check for only one of them was and is a useful thing
[21:08:54] <Assimilater> i'm sure you're right about what you say but i'm not sure i get it...
[21:09:01] <Assimilater> an element can have multiple attributes
[21:09:08] <coldhead> don't worry, just hear and obey
[21:09:13] <Assimilater> lol, k
[21:09:18] <ajpiano> right, but they are separate attributes
[21:09:31] <ajpiano> <div foo="bar" bar="bam"> etc
[21:09:33] <ajpiano> vs
[21:09:44] <ajpiano> <div class="foo bar baz">
[21:10:22] <ajpiano> also like coldhead kinda said
[21:10:39] <ajpiano> there's a difference between what was put into the lib 5 yrs ago pre 1.0
[21:10:41] <ajpiano> and what we'd add now
[21:11:40] <Assimilater> i can kind of understand, though i don't really appreciate the difference, between multi-class versus multi-att
[21:11:55] <Assimilater> and i get the change in aim
[21:11:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[21:12:04] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm looking for some assistance integrating jscrollpane
[21:12:06] <Assimilater> well, kind of anyways
[21:12:32] <Assimilater> i'm just not sure that being able to check for only one attr would be something that isn't useful
[21:12:50] <ProLoser|Mobile> does anyone have any experience with it?
[21:12:52] <Assimilater> i find it useful, but then again i use attributes like foo and bar that the browser might not use for various reasons
[21:13:36] <ajpiano> i think the party line is just like
[21:14:14] <ajpiano> .is() is for testing against any arbitrary selector expressino
[21:14:23] <ajpiano> including attrs
[21:14:55] <ajpiano> whereas hasClass is just kinda there, as it was a very very very common usecase
[21:15:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> very
[21:15:18] <Assimilater> hmm
[21:15:36] <Assimilater> ya got me there, no doubt hasClass would be used *more* than hasAttr
[21:15:42] <snover> hasClass should be faster too
[21:16:19] <Assimilater> though i do like consistency
[21:16:24] <Assimilater> which reminds me of another idea
[21:16:30] <ajpiano> oh woah, when did hasClass become the way it is now
[21:17:57] <ProLoser|Mobile> ?
[21:18:20] <ProLoser|Mobile> adder
[21:18:27] <ajpiano> i guess it did so https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/96dd06ea50674c77de4a5d953c227bb54d9276af
[21:18:56] <ajpiano> there
[21:19:35] <Assimilater> so on jquery ui sliders, .ui-widget-header has square corners, while the original slider divs have rounded corners another inconsistency that i'm wondering if is there primarily because the slider button generally hides it (though it sticks out like a sore thumb when you have a min or max set)
[21:19:39] <Assimilater> thoughts?
[21:19:48] <ajpiano> eh
[21:19:56] <Assimilater> is that a don't care eh? :P
[21:20:08] <ajpiano> no, it's an "eh?" eh..
[21:20:12] <Assimilater> oh
[21:20:27] <ProLoser|Mobile> do any of you guys actually use the ui-classes at all?
[21:20:29] <Assimilater> let me draft a couple fiddles
[21:20:35] * Assimilater does
[21:20:36] <ajpiano> i mean... if something doesn't have rounded corenrs and yyou want it to, add .ui-corner-all
[21:20:43] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Mobile: yeah i do
[21:20:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> do you hard code them or use jquery to inject them?
[21:21:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> it seems like it would tremendously clutter your code
[21:21:26] <ProLoser|Mobile> to have stuff like <section class="ui-cornersall">
[21:21:31] <ProLoser|Mobile> and like 20 other classes
[21:22:05] <Assimilater> well i used them for modifying ui on my graph i'll show in a bit in a way i didn't want to modify the core to do
[21:23:06] <Assimilater> (something i'm considering developing into a plugin, or starting a plugin on anyways, i'm sure some others could do more stuff with it than i have)
[21:25:03] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Mobile: it certainly makes more sense to just put them in your code
[21:25:24] <ajpiano> rather than inject with JS
[21:25:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> ya but at that rate, having like a string of 8 classes that don't actually signify content? it doesn't seem... cluttered to you?
[21:26:50] <Shazer2> hey
[21:27:04] <ajpiano> it kinda does... but thems the breaks
[21:27:06] <Shazer2> lets say im using $.post()
[21:27:18] <ajpiano> or you can just create your own classes to encapsulate the styling you want to do
[21:27:32] <ajpiano> Shazer2: it's ok, you can admit it, you're using $.post
[21:27:50] <ajpiano> :D
[21:27:50] <Shazer2> to post login data to a php file to process how can i see in the php file if it succeeded or not and then return to jquery
[21:27:53] <Shazer2> ^
[21:27:53] <Shazer2> :D
[21:28:03] <ajpiano> Shazer2: you have to use the callback
[21:28:11] <ajpiano> and return some sort of data from the php call that denotes whether or not it was successful
[21:28:29] <Assimilater> Shazer2: i use a hidden input with a special ID, if it helps
[21:29:08] <Assimilater> but then again i use .load most all the time
[21:29:14] <Assimilater> and i don't deal with login info
[21:29:19] <ajpiano> Shazer2: alternatively, you could actually respond with an error status code so that the client side error handler is triggered instead of a success
[21:29:30] <Shazer2> before we get into depth with that
[21:30:21] <Shazer2> what is the alternative to registering a session other then session_register() as it is deprecated in php 5.3.0
[21:30:21] <ajpiano> Shazer2: the bottom line is you can't "return" the result of your server side call into some already-executing javascript and have it magically pick up where it left off
[21:30:24] <Paul`> Paul.L`
[21:30:36] <ajpiano> Shazer2: that's not ontopic for this chan :)
[21:30:41] <Shazer2> ah apologies
[21:30:49] <Shazer2> better get this other bit sorted
[21:30:51] <Shazer2> ok so
[21:30:58] <Shazer2> once i check if the login works
[21:31:04] <Shazer2> how can i return if it worked or not to jquery?
[21:32:44] <ryanneufeld> Shazer2: you echo it out as JSON, or text, assuming you're using .ajax() and parse it in the success callback
[21:32:56] <Shazer2> O.O
[21:33:05] <Shazer2> $('#successLogin').html('You have successfully logged in!').fadeIn(500).delay(2000).fadeOut(500);
[21:33:21] <Shazer2> but it is going to return that regardless of whether the login was successful or not
[21:37:03] <Shazer2> ryanneufeld
[21:37:23] <ryanneufeld> your php script
[21:37:26] <ryanneufeld> needs to echo
[21:37:39] <Shazer2> echo what?
[21:37:42] <ryanneufeld> something that you can parse with the ajax success method
[21:37:42] <Shazer2> cos that's not gonna do what i want
[21:38:10] <ryanneufeld> yes, it is
[21:38:30] <ryanneufeld> the only way for PHP to send data back to the browser, is via echo
[21:39:03] <Shazer2> hmmm
[21:39:06] <Shazer2> so i can't have a fadein?
[21:39:07] <ryanneufeld> so if you have an ajax call, ie $.post()
[21:39:12] <ryanneufeld> yes, youc an
[21:39:15] <ryanneufeld> you can
[21:39:56] <ryanneufeld> so in your php if you have it echo {"result":true} or {"result":false}
[21:40:12] <ryanneufeld> then in your success callback for your $.post()
[21:40:37] <ryanneufeld> you check if the result is true or false and then show the appropriate message
[21:43:01] <mwgtsr> hey there, does anyone know who to use an AND for two events?
[21:43:17] <mwgtsr> $('#t1 &&  #m21').mouseout(function () like this
[21:44:37] <Assimilater> sorry that took a while, had to dig up old code, haha, so if anyone remembers me mentioning fiddling a graph and is still interested here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/FnKVB/1/
[21:45:04] <Assimilater> this kind of goes back to the idea of inconsistency in the .ui-widget-header on ui sliders (which is usually hid by the button)
[21:45:16] <Assimilater> also any feedback on maybe making a plugin welcome
[21:45:41] <Shazer2> echo "result:true";
[21:45:41] <Shazer2> } else {
[21:45:41] <Shazer2> 	echo "result:false";
[21:45:41] <Shazer2> }
[21:45:47] <Shazer2> ryanneufeld ^
[21:46:05] <ryanneufeld> kinda
[21:46:16] <Assimilater> ajpiano: you still here?
[21:46:20] <Shazer2> in the callback how do I know if it's false or true?
[21:46:28] <ryanneufeld> '{"result":false}'
[21:46:50] <ryanneufeld> ?.ajax() @ Shazer2
[21:46:50] <bot-t> Shazer2, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:47:27] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i think yes, you're corret
[21:47:36] <ajpiano> it doesn't have the class because it's covered by the handle
[21:47:44] <ajpiano> Assimilater: FYI, a planned feature for jQuery UI 1.9
[21:47:48] <ajpiano> is a map of classes and elements
[21:47:58] <ajpiano> so that you can choose which strucutural elements generated by jquery ui
[21:48:08] <Assimilater> ooh....that will be nice
[21:48:11] <ajpiano> will get which presentational classes (ui corrner, etc)
[21:48:59] <ajpiano> Assimilater http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7053
[21:49:27] <Shazer2> is it possible to do if {result:true} {}
[21:49:29] <Shazer2> ryanneufeld
[21:49:42] <Assimilater> sick is all i can say :)
[21:50:40] <Assimilater> what do you think of the idea of a graph plugin like this?
[21:51:06] <Shazer2> ok im lost
[21:51:15] <mwgtsr>  how can i  use the AND operator in jquery?
[21:53:58] <snover> ?jqisjs @ mwgtsr
[21:53:59] <bot-t> mwgtsr, ?jquery-version
[21:54:06] <snover> what the fuck is wrong with you bot-t
[21:54:06] <bot-t> snover, My sources say no.
[21:54:09] <snover> ?jsisjs @ mwgtsr
[21:54:09] <bot-t> mwgtsr, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[21:54:30] <Shazer2> can someone give me a hand here.
[21:54:53] <ryanneufeld> lol snover
[21:55:00] <Shazer2> ryanneufeld
[21:55:02] <Shazer2> you seem to be helpful
[21:55:03] <Shazer2> :)
[21:55:07] <Shazer2> so i do
[21:55:13] <ryanneufeld> that's an illusion
[21:55:19] <ryanneufeld> you have 3mins
[21:55:20] <Shazer2> $.ajax() { url: "inc/check.php" ,}
[21:55:27] <Shazer2> what else do i return
[21:55:29] <Shazer2> i dont get.
[21:56:19] <Assimilater> ajpiano: still with me?
[21:56:56] <ajpiano> Assimilater: it seems like a fine idea
[21:57:01] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[21:57:04] <Shazer2> can you give me a hand
[21:57:09] <ajpiano> Assimilater: in case you didn't notice i'm doing a handful of stuff right now :p
[21:57:12] <mwgtsr> snover:  can you help me with the sintax then pls $(('#t1').mouseout && ('#m21').mouseout)(function () whats wrong here?
[21:57:15] <Shazer2> oh
[21:57:20] <Shazer2> nvm
[21:57:20] <ProLoser|Mobile> ajpiano: does this room have a ~bitch command?

[21:58:44] <snover> ?broken
[21:58:45] <bot-t> select isn't broken: It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application. -- http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips

[21:58:48] <bot-t> OMG my jquery is broke help me fix it? http://imgur.com/ODD8V.jpg
[21:58:52] <ajpiano> Shazer2: are you familiar with the term "callback" yet?
[21:59:00] <snover> ajpiano: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU BROKE MY WEB SITE YOU BITCH
[21:59:07] <ProLoser|Mobile> ajpiano: i thought paul changed it to "holaback"
[21:59:14] <ajpiano> lol x 2
[21:59:24] <ryanneufeld> Shazer2: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/SXt8D/
[21:59:46] <Shazer2> I am processing a login with jquery via $.post() and I need to return a true or false in the check.php and in the callback in the jquery output whether its true or false
[22:00:02] <ajpiano> Shazer2, do you know what json is?
[22:00:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> Shazer2: google "submit form with jquery"
[22:00:20] <ProLoser|Mobile> there are tutorials that show you how to deal with responses
[22:00:56] <gnarf> Assimilater: looks nice :)
[22:00:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> lol if you hold his hand you will be here all night
[22:00:56] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Mobile: i'm just getting to the link part :)
[22:01:48] <ProLoser|Mobile> anyone here use jscrollpane?

[22:03:19] <Shazer2> ryanneufeld
[22:03:23] <Shazer2> it ruins
[22:03:26] <Shazer2> the toggle
[22:03:35] <ryanneufeld> ruins? or runs?
[22:04:34] <Assimilater> gnarf: thanks (the top one is old code i was using to point out the inconsistency in square versus round corners on ui sliders, but it's usually covered by the handle) the bottom two are what i'm considering using
[22:04:55] <ryanneufeld> Sorry Shazer2 but I gotta header, sounds like you need some jquery 101
[22:05:01] <ryanneufeld> ?101 @Shazer2

[22:06:33] <Shazer2> ruins ryanneufeld
[22:07:30] <Shazer2> fml
[22:10:08] <Shazer2> why would changing a verification function mess with the ability to toggle?
[22:15:46] <Shazer2> ah got it figured
[22:15:53] <Shazer2> ryanneufeld
[22:15:58] <Shazer2> now it isn't returning anything
[22:20:51] <Shazer2> hmmm
[22:20:53] <Shazer2> its returning false
[22:20:57] <Shazer2> but im using the correc tpassword.
[22:20:58] <Shazer2> correct*
[22:22:42] <muley> why would .ajaxSubmit() automatically include the parameter: "?callback=jquery1321654654654" ? i've not seen that before...
[22:22:55] <muley> i'm not doing jsonp
[22:23:04] <snover> well something thinks you are.
[22:23:24] <muley> bah!
[22:23:30] <Shazer2> snover
[22:23:32] <Shazer2> wait nvm
[22:23:35] <Shazer2> i forgot about ?bitch
[22:24:07] <muley> it works now. all i did was ask here...
[22:24:14] <muley> snover you are magical
[22:24:28] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9436
[22:24:39] <muley> wow looked at that for probably 20 minutes... w. t. ffffk.
[22:24:57] <Shazer2> its returning false, even though the password i enter is exactly the same as in the db
[22:25:08] <Shazer2> and its not outputting the callback
[22:25:08] <Shazer2> :(
[22:26:56] <Shazer2> anyone know
[22:28:45] <muley> Shazer2: not sure what's up, but why do you do $.ajax inside your $.post callback?
[22:28:55] <muley> double ajax
[22:29:03] <Shazer2> because i post to check.php to process login
[22:29:16] <Shazer2> and then n the callback ($.ajax) i see if the login is true or false
[22:29:19] <Shazer2> then display appropriate actions
[22:29:53] <muley> if it posts to the same file, why not just make it one ajax call? less chance for things to go wrong
[22:30:12] <muley> does the first ajax return?
[22:30:21] <muley> if you put a breakpoint in there?
[22:30:23] <Shazer2> but how do i get the tre/false
[22:30:26] <Shazer2> true*
[22:32:21] <muley> the second $.ajax doesn't appear to send any data either?
[22:32:41] <caz_> Hi, I'm tring to get a href value withing a a list, how can I achieve it. To get my list I use : $("#pages").find("#facet li a")
[22:33:49] <muley> Shazer2: you probably just want this: http://mysticpaste.com/view/9437
[22:35:49] <muley> Shazer2: the returned json from the first ajax call will be the "returnData"... no need for the second call
[22:36:40] <Shazer2> muley
[22:36:42] <Shazer2> echo json_encode(array("result"=>true));
[22:36:47] <Shazer2> what is that replaced with then
[22:37:05] <Shazer2> to get true/false in the check.php
[22:37:06] <muley> { 'result' : true }
[22:37:28] <muley> that will be the parameter you named "returnData"
[22:37:56] <muley> a javascript object
[22:37:56] <Shazer2> so just echo that?
[22:37:56] <muley> yep
[22:37:56] <muley> and only that
[22:38:26] <Shazer2> ok
[22:38:28] <Shazer2> it doesn't work.
[22:38:40] <muley> lol
[22:39:00] <muley> got a url?
[22:39:18] <Shazer2> hold on
[22:39:18] <muley> what's the result of the ajax request show in firebug?
[22:39:27] <Shazer2> ajax request show?
[22:39:33] <muley> you can see exactly what is sent and returned in the firebug console
[22:39:58] <Shazer2> yeah im in developer console
[22:40:02] <Shazer2> and it doesn't seem to echo anything out
[22:40:26] <muley> do you see your ajax request being sent out?
[22:40:53] <Shazer2> as in
[22:40:58] <Shazer2> is check.php executed?
[22:41:27] <muley> right. you can see the full request in firebug... ie the file your ajax is calling and what gets returned
[22:41:36] <Shazer2> it isn't echoing the true or false thing
[22:42:21] <muley> try to put echo json_encode(array("result"=>true)); as the first line of "inc/check.php" then die right after it
[22:42:56] <muley> then you'll know if this is a javascript or php issue
[22:43:20] <Shazer2> nothing
[22:43:23] <Shazer2> doesnt return anything
[22:43:45] <Caz__> Hello
[22:44:13] <muley> are you sure that javascript code is getting executed?
[22:44:25] <muley> that makes the $.post
[22:44:31] <muley> do you have a link?
[22:44:32] <muley> lol
[22:45:08] <Shazer2> its just hosted locally
[22:45:09] <Shazer2> :/
[22:46:11] <Shazer2> do not understand..
[22:46:12] <Shazer2> why
[22:46:34] <muley> put a breakpoint in your verifyLogin function in firebug
[22:46:49] <muley> on the $.post link... make sure that code is actually running
[22:47:14] <Caz__> Does anyone knows how can I achieve to filter a href within a link list? I get my list with $("#pages").find("#facet li a") but i don't know how to filter it
[22:50:53] <Shazer2> muley
[22:50:54] <Shazer2> I'm lost
[22:51:14] <muley> heh.. have you used firebug breakpoints ever?
[22:51:18] <muley> life savers
[22:52:36] <Shazer2> i dont have "firebug"
[22:53:12] <bot-t> Shazer2, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[22:53:22] <muley> what browser do you use? you should really use the developer tools of whatever browser you use
[22:53:26] <Caz__> ok, I did it with : $("#pages").find("#facet li a").filter("[href=#facet_show]")
[22:53:36] <muley> will REALLY help you out
[22:53:43] <Shazer2> muley
[22:53:53] <Shazer2> i use developer tools
[22:54:22] <muley> breakpoints? can you put a breakpoint in that function?
[22:55:02] <Caz__> Shazer2, what are your developper tools?
[22:56:43] <muley> or just put an alert as the first line in verifyLogin() to make sure that function is getting called
[22:57:11] <muley> but you should reallllllly use breakpoints.. you can see exactly what all of your variables are and step through your code line by line

[23:03:09] <muley> lol
[23:03:19] <Shazer2> erm.
[23:03:21] <Shazer2> what do
[23:04:10] <muley> didnt you put "echo json_encode(array("result"=>true)); die;" (without quotes) as the first line of check.php?
[23:04:54] <muley> seems your jquery is good... the php is flawwed
[23:05:07] <muley> flawed
[23:05:22] <Shazer2> AH
[23:05:27] <Shazer2> http://gyazo.com/6c5c896ea3047301185e322b90719c27.png
[23:05:34] <muley> there she is!
[23:05:47] <muley> did you get your login success message too?
[23:06:37] <Shazer2> no.
[23:07:49] <muley> you got rid of that double ajax stuff right? and are doing this: http://mysticpaste.com/view/9437
[23:08:50] <Shazer2> yup
[23:08:52] <muley> maybe "#successLogin" doesn't exist in your DOM? or you have that ID in more than 1 place in your HTML?
[23:09:19] <Shazer2> muley
[23:09:30] <muley> Shazer2: what's this do: $(location).attr('href',url);
[23:09:36] <Shazer2> hold on
[23:09:37] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9438
[23:09:39] <Shazer2> thats my check
[23:10:25] <muley> something in connect.php must be printing all that other garbage?
[23:10:52] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9439
[23:14:22] <muley> if you look at the wrong data being returned... it's a stacktrace...
[23:14:30] <muley> "Call to undefined function session_register()"
[23:14:33] <muley> php errors
[23:14:44] <Shazer2> hmm
[23:14:52] <Shazer2> its deprecated in php 5.3.0
[23:14:55] <Shazer2> whats the fix though
[23:14:56] <muley> man you've got xdebug installed too... need to learn to use that stuff
[23:14:59] <Shazer2> ive been looking but cant find anything
[23:15:29] <muley> just set it. $_SESSION['username'] = $username;
[23:16:26] <muley> make sure you do a "session_start()" at the top of your PHP too
[23:17:02] <muley> the PHP manual tells you how to fix it: http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-register.php
[23:17:06] <muley> =D
[23:17:30] <qaov> hello, iam building multiple ajax request script. But I have problem after ajax request. I wanna to put elements from success to an array. After end of this loop I dont have access to subhtml array. http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/zF9gV5KR
[23:17:45] <Shazer2> muley
[23:17:49] <Shazer2> it's still having things go wron
[23:18:04] <qaov> jquery tells me that subhtml is not defined
[23:18:40] <Shazer2> what now muley
[23:18:50] <muley> yep... all development is one problem after another
[23:18:55] <muley> got a few tackled
[23:18:58] <Shazer2> ok
[23:19:21] <muley> where's it at now? what's that alert say?
[23:20:10] <Shazer2> do you want the alert at the first line of the 4
[23:20:15] <Shazer2> $.post callback
[23:20:37] <muley> yeah so you can see what the returned data is from $.post
[23:20:45] <hExDj> how do I target a radio button? since it can be one of different inputs
[23:21:10] <Shazer2> http://gyazo.com/19ede41c596ff2828f97d5415ba1ccf9.png
[23:21:37] <Shazer2> muley ^
[23:21:48] <muley> typo: "sesson_start()"
[23:21:57] <muley> session_start()... you got this...
[23:22:31] <Shazer2> {'result':true}
[23:22:39] <Shazer2> but no message
[23:22:39] <muley> hey!
[23:22:50] <Shazer2> btw
[23:22:52] <Shazer2> i am just doing echo '{"result":true}';
[23:22:54] <Shazer2> in my code
[23:23:06] <Shazer2> not echo json_encode(array("result"=>true));
[23:23:11] <Shazer2> does that matter?
[23:23:11] <Shazer2> or?
[23:23:38] <muley> json_encode would be preferred since you dont have to worry about typos in json if you ever add more to it
[23:23:42] <muley> doesnt matter though
[23:24:03] <muley> ok so the ajax is working, the php doesnt have errors anymore and returns the json
[23:24:55] <Shazer2> yup
[23:24:57] <Shazer2> so now just the message
[23:25:11] <muley> are you sure $("#successLogin") exists?
[23:25:26] <muley> that id is in your HTML
[23:25:47] <muley> and only once
[23:26:10] <muley> comment out this line: $(location).attr('href',url);
[23:26:11] <Shazer2> yes.
[23:26:26] <muley> and try it
[23:26:45] <muley> or do "location.href = url;" if you're trying to redirect
[23:27:33] <Shazer2> ok
[23:27:35] <Shazer2> no message still
[23:27:53] <muley> alert(
[23:28:09] <muley> alert( $('#successLogin').length );
[23:28:12] <muley> should be 1 if it finds it
[23:28:25] <crashev_> hello, I have <div id="answers"...> <input type="checkbox" value="1"> and its checked => shouldn't this => $('#answers > checkbox:checked').length return number of checked boxes? it always returns 0 ?
[23:29:03] <Shazer2> returns 1 muley
[23:29:57] <muley> wow thanks comcast... you say anything?
[23:30:30] <Shazer2> muley
[23:30:35] <Shazer2> i said it returns 1
[23:31:19] <muley> k then it should work. as a test, replace ".fadeIn(500).delay(2000).fadeOut(500);" with ".show()" ... it may just be a css thing now
[23:31:41] <muley> you took out this line too, right: $(location).attr('href',url);
[23:31:48] <hExDj> how do I target a radio button? since it can be one of different inputs
[23:32:00] <hExDj> return $("input[name=theName]").val(); doesn seem to work for me
[23:32:11] <Shazer2> can I remove the alerts
[23:32:13] <Shazer2> and yes i did
[23:32:19] <muley> $("input[name=theName]:checked").val();
[23:32:21] <muley> i think
[23:32:35] <muley> yeah remove them and just do .show() and see if you see it
[23:32:45] <hExDj> muley: but I have several radio buttons and I need to know which value is the selected one
[23:33:11] <muley> the :checked will get the selected one
[23:33:16] <hExDj> ah I see
[23:33:17] <Shazer2> i did that, but it didnt work
[23:33:21] <hExDj> let me try then
[23:33:46] <muley> Shazer2: re-pasted your jquery code plz
[23:33:51] <muley> *re-paste
[23:34:19] <hExDj> muley: works perfectly! thanks!
[23:34:25] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9440
[23:34:28] <muley> w00t
[23:35:18] <muley> Shazer2: comment out the "location.href = url;" for a second... you may be getting redirected before you ever see the message
[23:35:38] <Shazer2> muley
[23:35:43] <Shazer2> im not getting redirected because
[23:35:43] <muley> Shazer2
[23:35:46] <Shazer2> my URL is always http://localhost/srothe/index.php#
[23:35:50] <Shazer2> it would be index.php
[23:35:53] <Shazer2> if i got redirected
[23:35:54] <Shazer2> this is confusing
[23:36:29] <muley> breakpoints would clear things up :D:D:D
[23:36:36] <muley> comment it and see
[23:38:15] <Shazer2> i did
[23:38:18] <Shazer2> it doesn't make a difference
[23:39:17] <muley> =[
[23:39:22] <muley> sooo close
[23:39:26] <Shazer2> i have no idea
[23:39:29] <Shazer2> and i have to go now
[23:40:08] <muley> well... 5 hurdles jumped, 1 to go
[23:40:21] <muley> don't knock it over
[23:40:23] <muley> g'luck
[23:40:27] <Shazer2> ok
[23:40:32] <Shazer2> email me anything you think might be wrong
[23:40:34] <Shazer2> shannonwebdev@gmail.com
[23:40:46] <Shazer2> ok?
[23:41:07] <muley> CSS
[23:41:33] <Shazer2> ok going cya
[23:41:38] <muley> is the only thing i can think. inspect the DOM with your developer tools and see what the element with id=successLogin is
[23:41:51] <muley> i bet it has the html but just isnt shown for some reason
[23:41:54] <muley> k k bye
[23:43:26] <TeddyMurray> what are the popular computer news sites these days?
[23:43:57] <muley> reddit
[23:44:01] <muley> slashdot
[23:44:33] <TeddyMurray> slashdot has stood strong for a long time now
[23:44:33] <TeddyMurray> lol
[23:45:36] <muley> yeah been a lot of years
[23:45:52] <muley> still fresh
[23:51:34] <mattalexx> How do I do this: el.children('.col1 img, .col3 > h2')
[23:52:04] <mattalexx> ... which isn't working, by the way. I want to make sure the .col1 and .col3 are directo children of el. Possible?
[23:54:17] <muley> maybe el.find('> .col1 img, > .col3 > h2');
