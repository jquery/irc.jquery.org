[00:20:26] <nytek> Hi. Would somebody please be so kind as to take a moment to tell my why my link fails to trigger a transition upon another div when clicked? The div in question is "#clickMeDiv", and the link itself is named, "clickMe". It should make said div visible, but instead, nothing happens. http://jsfiddle.net/mxn1fh9t/27/
[00:23:19] <VectorX> how can i say (this,this.classname) ?
[00:23:42] <VectorX> so i want to add a class to this aswell as another element inside this with a particular classname
[00:30:55] <VectorX> https://jsfiddle.net/n14Lm5nk/
[00:33:27] <VectorX> or something like $(this,'this.desc').addClass("ir");
[00:33:38] <VectorX> how would i do that
[01:11:02] <civpro> im having an wierd issue with a bootstrap popover, in jsfiddle it works fine, however in my code, when i hover over the link all its not triggering, how can i troubleshoot this?
[01:11:14] <civpro> ive read many ways on how to do it
[01:11:23] <civpro> nothing is working
[01:12:13] <civpro> or any advice?
[01:12:50] <civpro> here is the jsfiddle code that is working https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/
[01:13:52] <nytek> Really simple question regarding transitions: I'm trying to make the div-box appear on click, but nothing is happening. If I were to ask now, then would somebody please tell me why? https://jsfiddle.net/
[01:14:23] <nytek> https://jsfiddle.net/s343ged6/
[01:14:49] <civpro> i had a similiar issue
[01:15:02] <civpro> i had to remove the class then add on the new one
[01:15:20] <civpro> plus changeMe needs to be in quote
[01:15:24] <civpro> quotes*
[01:15:47] <Cork> nytek: "changeMe" is a variable that isn't defined
[01:15:56] <Cork> so your doing .addClass(null);
[01:16:11] <Cork> it should be a string instead
[01:16:30] <civpro> yup
[01:16:50] <nytek> Thanks. I tried 	$("#box").addClass("changeMe") just now
[01:16:55] <nytek> It doesn't seem to work either. Hm.
[01:17:05] <nytek> https://jsfiddle.net/s343ged6/2/
[01:17:07] <civpro> yeah i saw that too
[01:17:11] <VectorX> nytek https://jsfiddle.net/s343ged6/3/
[01:17:53] <nytek> Awesome, thanks. Comparing them now.
[01:18:00] <VectorX> 3 changes
[01:18:07] <civpro> how about me?
[01:18:07] <Cork> nytek: also #link is a class not an id
[01:18:38] <civpro> using popover with bootstrap
[01:18:47] <civpro> works in jsfiddle, not working in my code
[01:18:50] <civpro> exactly the same
[01:18:59] <civpro> how can i troubleshoot why its not triggering
[01:19:08] <Cork> nytek: https://jsfiddle.net/s343ged6/4/
[01:19:27] <Cork> nytek: .changeMe is less specific then #box so the .changeMe css declaration loses
[01:19:40] <civpro> Vector already sent him a working version Cork
[01:19:46] <nytek> VectorX: Ohhhhhhhhh. box.changeMe, .link and which was the third?
[01:19:59] <nytek> Cork: loading now, thanks
[01:20:09] <VectorX> nytek the ('changeMe');
[01:20:19] <VectorX> you have to pass the class as a string
[01:20:47] <VectorX> civpro yeah but Cork added the prevent default which is important, if not it might try to navigate or move up the screen
[01:20:59] <civpro> ah ok
[01:21:05] <nytek> I see. Thank you guys much. :)
[01:21:27] <civpro> have you guys used bootstrap popover?
[01:21:29] <Cork> nytek, VectorX: that said, you shouldn't use a link with href="#"
[01:21:39] <Cork> use a button instead in those cases
[01:22:10] <Cork> civpro: is your code wrapped in $(function() {})
[01:22:18] <civpro> yes
[01:22:25] <civpro> here is a jsfiddle example that is working
[01:22:27] <nytek> Is there a reason that is personal or objective in stating so, Cork? Just curious
[01:22:29] <Cork> jsfiddle wrapps the javascript section in load events by default
[01:22:30] <nytek> regarding design
[01:22:31] <civpro> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/
[01:22:35] <Cork> a normal webpage doesn't do that
[01:22:47] <nytek> Unconventional, in other words
[01:22:50] <nytek> Fair enough
[01:23:06] <Cork> nytek: semantic
[01:23:18] <civpro> pretty simple example just to see if what i was using would work
[01:23:20] <Cork> your html says "here is a link to #" and that makes no sense
[01:23:23] <nytek> Cork: Rewording/confirming.
[01:23:44] <Cork> nytek: while <button type="button"> says "here is a click action"
[01:24:01] <civpro> just trying to figure out if you guys may have some idea on a way to find out why something isnt triggering
[01:24:03] <Cork> so it stays semanticly correct
[01:24:14] <nytek> Fair enough. I just figured a button would clash with the design overall, but your logic is flawless.
[01:24:33] <Cork> nytek: you can remove background, border on a button
[01:24:39] <Cork> it doens't have to look different to a link
[01:24:49] <civpro> i can give you the actual code but it has variables in htere
[01:24:50] <civpro> there8
[01:24:54] <civpro> *
[01:24:56] <civpro> SvrHtml += "<span class='fa-stack fa-2x' id='Hover_" + myID + "' data-trigger='hover' title='title' data-content='content' data-placement='bottom' >";
[01:25:18] <Cork> civpro: your jsfiddle doesn't have any js at al in it so...
[01:25:23] <Cork> *at all
[01:25:30] <nytek> Cork: Aha...you're onto something. Thanks all the more for the suggestion.
[01:25:35] <nytek> Button it is.
[01:25:41] <civpro> yeah at the bottom
[01:25:46] <civpro> uner javascript
[01:25:53] <civpro> $(function() {
[01:25:53] <civpro> 	$('[data-trigger="hover"]').popover();
[01:25:53] <civpro> })
[01:26:04] <Cork> "/* Latest compiled and minified JavaScript included as External Resource */"
[01:26:07] <Cork> is all that is in there
[01:26:13] <civpro> maybe it didnt update
[01:26:14] <civpro> 1 second
[01:26:25] <civpro> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/15966/
[01:26:31] <Cork> O_o
[01:26:36] <Cork> 15966??
[01:26:42] <Cork> jikes XD
[01:27:00] <civpro> i didnt save after adding in the working code
[01:27:14] <civpro> above is the actual code that isnt working
[01:27:17] <Cork> 15966 means there are close to 16000 changes to that fiddle...
[01:27:28] <Cork> did you modify a demo or something >_>
[01:27:42] <civpro> i went to a jsfiddle that already had bootstrap
[01:27:58] <civpro> so i didnt have to load in the files
[01:28:14] <Cork> well make sure you include the bootstrap resources
[01:28:21] <Cork> otgher then that, it should work
[01:28:36] <civpro> yes they are included in the code
[01:28:55] <Cork> pastebin the full html of the page your working with
[01:29:05] <civpro> ok
[01:30:38] <civpro> http://pastebin.com/nBt9eqPG
[01:31:14] <civpro> line 102
[01:31:34] <civpro> and line 113
[01:31:35] <Cork> uh
[01:31:56] <Cork> your adding popover to all [data-trigger="hover"] inside a setInterval...
[01:32:10] <civpro> take it out of the interval?
[01:32:19] <civpro> into the main document.ready?
[01:32:22] <Cork> well $(function() {}) won't help you there
[01:32:25] <civpro> i tried that before but it didnt work
[01:32:33] <Cork> depends on what you expect it to do
[01:32:49] <Cork> $(function() {}); is to wait for the initial document to stabilize
[01:32:51] <civpro> well on line 102, i am trying to do a hover
[01:32:59] <Cork> setInterval will throw that out the door
[01:33:20] <Cork> are you dynamically adding more of those?
[01:33:34] <civpro> setInterval is used because the records that are pulling from the load on line 43
[01:33:50] <Cork> ...
[01:33:56] <Cork> no, nonono...
[01:34:06] <Cork> .load has a callback use that
[01:34:17] <civpro> i am using .load
[01:34:24] <Cork> ya, but not the callback
[01:34:25] <civpro> line 43
[01:34:36] <civpro> not sure what you mean
[01:34:50] <Cork> your firing a load call and then starts a timer constantly checking for the content
[01:34:59] <Cork> just do $().load(url, function() {});
[01:35:16] <civpro> the interval is set so it refreshes the data every 3 seconds
[01:35:29] <Cork> but why
[01:35:36] <Cork> you load the content once
[01:35:39] <civpro> because they are log files getting added to a database
[01:35:46] <civpro> no its loading continuously
[01:35:48] <Cork> ah, sorry
[01:35:54] <Cork> ok, then there are other problems
[01:36:11] <Cork> you should use setTimeout and fire a new timeout when the load completes
[01:36:24] <Cork> else you can end up with multiple calls going at the same time
[01:36:33] <Cork> as setInterval doesn't wait for the actions to complete
[01:36:46] <civpro> ahh
[01:36:56] <Cork> also .load doesn't block the rest of the code from running
[01:37:23] <civpro> can i safely move the data-trigger function under document.ready?
[01:37:31] <Cork> actually you are guaranteed to run all the code after before it is completed
[01:37:39] <Cork> no
[01:37:46] <Cork> if .load loads more of them that won't work
[01:38:00] <civpro> what if i put it in after the load?
[01:38:06] <civpro> outside of the interval
[01:38:19] <Cork> civpro: you need to read up on what async is
[01:38:38] <Cork> you have load of async calls in this code, but expect it to be sync
[01:38:44] <Cork> *loads
[01:38:56] <civpro> i know what async is, it runs multiple items on their own timeline without knowing what will finish before another, allows multi-tasking
[01:39:08] <Cork> civpro: then why isn't your code reflecting that
[01:39:14] <Cork> your code looks like you thing it is sync
[01:39:27] <Cork> cause everything is expecting the line before to complete before it
[01:39:32] <Cork> and that isn't the case
[01:39:41] <civpro> i didnt know i was running it async
[01:39:47] <civpro> thats why
[01:39:49] <Cork> setInterval is async
[01:39:55] <Cork> .load is network calls so it is async
[01:40:00] <civpro> ok let me look up a setTimeout then
[01:40:07] <Cork> (setTimeout is also async)
[01:40:17] <civpro> what isnt async?
[01:40:26] <Cork> if you want to delay, nothing
[01:40:38] <Cork> async is a must to do delayed things in js
[01:40:46] <civpro> maybe i should explain more
[01:41:01] <civpro> so i a have some javascript for the page that loads once
[01:41:11] <civpro> then there are 2 items that are dynamically updating
[01:41:22] <civpro> 1 is the logs we have been talking about
[01:41:31] <civpro> the other is the SchedulerCT
[01:41:39] <civpro> which basically refreshes the page if it changes
[01:42:04] <civpro> the .load only takes care of part of the page, not all
[01:42:20] <civpro> so maybe it should be async for that instance
[01:43:08] <civpro> its actually working pretty good other than the current issue
[01:43:23] <civpro> for the mouseover, i wanted to show the last 5 records for that specific server
[01:43:48] <civpro> so that is what i was trying to create utilizing bootstrap
[01:44:27] <civpro> make sense?
[01:46:30] <Cork> someone else will have to jump in here, i'm on a tight schedule and can't spend that much brain cycles to dig into that
[01:46:53] <civpro> ok
[01:47:02] <civpro> thanks for taking a look
[01:47:21] <civpro> VectorX could you take a look?
[01:51:22] <arup_r> What is the opposite of `.append()` ? :) I forgot and dunno know how to search.. I want to add the html as the first child of the selected dom
[01:51:50] <Cork> åreåemd
[01:51:56] <Cork> opps
[01:51:59] <Cork> offset :)
[01:52:02] <Cork> prepend
[01:52:04] <civpro> actually i think i can use title and get enough data
[01:52:14] <civpro> i was going to show the last 5 results but i can do the last 1
[01:52:18] <arup_r> yes.. Cork http://api.jquery.com/prepend/ :p
[01:52:44] <Cork> arup_r: i meant offset on my keyboard å is right next to p
[01:55:40] <arup_r> not for me..
[01:55:56] <Cork> didn't say it was :)
[01:56:48] <nytek> Okay, Cork: if you're down...this is the next level up from my first question about making #box appear. :|
[01:57:08] <nytek> I'm trying to make the box you told me to create do the same thing more or less; create a div underneath it instead of making a box over it.
[01:57:13] <nytek> Nothing transitions, however.
[01:57:14] <nytek> http://jsfiddle.net/nytek/mxn1fh9t/54/
[01:57:33] <nytek> I'm pretty sure I followed all of your advice including the event arg
[01:57:37] <Cork> i've never said anything about creating box
[01:57:44] <Cork> think you've mixed up the nicks
[01:57:57] <nytek> Well, the link was regarding semantics and anchors versus boxes
[01:58:06] <nytek> And it had to do with a box appearing when said link was clicked
[01:58:07] <nytek> No?
[01:58:08] <CsSn0ob> Why does my Signup button pops up right away every time I visit the page or refresh it. |http://i.imgur.com/1lgXTtd.jpg | Url Link :  http://raineer24.github.io/kangi/| |
[01:58:38] <Cork> ah, that part, the way you phrased it made it sound like you asked about something else
[01:58:45] <nytek> Oh, okay. Yeah.
[01:59:08] <nytek> So I have applied the same concept to an app if you would kindly take a moment to check it out. The syntax LOOKS the same to my naked eye.
[01:59:26] <nytek> I'm assuming you'll spot the difference in a second; what's wrong with it
[01:59:26] <nytek> http://jsfiddle.net/nytek/mxn1fh9t/54/
[01:59:36] <Cork> nytek: btw you should prob look into event delegation
[01:59:45] <Cork> your adding a lot of duplicate event handlers there
[01:59:47] <nytek> Check. Opening in devdocs now
[02:00:19] <nytek> Okay. I have event delegation open (and much appreciated, btw).
[02:02:22] <Cork> nytek: #readMeDiv.activate won't affect #magicButton.activate
[02:02:51] <Cork> nytek: i suggest splitting the opacity into a separate class and add that to those buttons
[02:03:03] <Cork> that way you won't have to repeate the id all over the place
[02:03:45] <nytek> Ohhh... so just add the same class to all things that were originally opacity: 0
[02:03:47] <nytek> Brilliant
[02:04:30] <nytek> What about the error regarding why it won't pop up #readMeDiv? Any idea why, do you know? I thought I followed your syntax exactly (aside from streamlining my events ad you noted I should and will).
[02:05:02] <Cork> it is the reason i stated right before
[02:05:30] <nytek> Ohh...I missed that line in the room
[02:05:31] <nytek> My bad
[02:05:59] <Cork> nytek: the base problem is #myid { opacity: 0; } is more specific then .activate { opacity: 1; }
[02:06:16] <Cork> so the former will still win on <elm id="myid" class="activate"
[02:07:28] <nytek> Hm. So I can make a new class, and it will override the myid original? Sorry if that sounds noobish. This area is new to me.
[02:07:35] <Cork> no
[02:07:57] <Cork> you can make a new class, and the parts you want the old class to win over when it gets added
[02:08:04] <Cork> and have it exist BEFORE the old class in the css
[02:08:37] <nytek> Hm. So how can I make this div pop up under the calc when clicked? I'm totally at a loss here if you'd put me out of my misery with it, so to speak
[02:08:41] <Cork> #myid { something else } .something { opacity: 0; } .activate { opacity: 1; }
[02:09:20] <nytek> So add something first by default onload, perhaps, and then on click, make it .activate?
[02:09:27] <Cork> no
[02:09:30] <Cork> js can't solve this
[02:09:35] <Cork> you need to fix the css
[02:10:04] <Cork> (well you can solve it with js, but the problem is in the css so fix it there)
[02:10:32] <nytek> So if I separate them out like that...my question is how to utilize the .something and .activate class...please?
[02:10:49] <Cork> nytek: <elm id="myid" class="something">
[02:10:56] <Cork> then .addClass('activate')
[02:11:20] <Cork> nytek: in css id is the most specific single selector
[02:11:21] <nytek> Ohhhhhh
[02:11:31] <Cork> followed by class, attribute and element name
[02:11:38] <Cork> (in that order)
[02:11:39] <nytek> I didn't know that. Note made. :D
[02:12:23] <nytek> Thanks a million for taking me to school, Cork.
[02:12:25] <nytek> :D
[02:18:30] <nytek> Hmm... Okay. Didn't I implement it correctly? http://jsfiddle.net/nytek/mxn1fh9t/55/embedded/result/dark/
[02:18:37] <nytek> Whoops...that's the result
[02:18:46] <nytek> http://jsfiddle.net/nytek/mxn1fh9t/55/
[02:19:04] <nytek> I made .transparent into a class and added it #magicButton
[02:19:19] <nytek> Then I used activate to switch it to opacity: 0 like you said
[02:19:54] <Cork> nytek: your css is broken
[02:20:02] <Cork> you haven't closed the magic id declaration
[02:20:28] <Cork> also you need to move the #readMeDiv.activate after it
[02:20:32] <Cork> and remove the id
[02:20:53] <nytek> Damn. Alright...just a sec. heh
[02:22:34] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[02:51:15] <nytek> Cork: One last time, if you would... I tried everything now.  :|

[03:30:06] <hellyeah> anyone knows about jquery ui datepicker
[03:30:08] <hellyeah> ?
[03:32:39] <hellyeah> brb
[04:15:11] <hellyeah> hey anyone around at that moment?
[04:21:30] <Uhkis> define the moment!
[04:22:00] <hellyeah> this moment :XD
[04:22:17] <hellyeah> you can create an element
[04:22:52] <hellyeah> i have from and to when you pick something from "from" i have to disable date in "to" how can i do that? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/538/
[04:24:32] <hellyeah> Uhkis: do you understand?
[04:25:16] <snowman44> you have two input elements with classes "from" and "to". when you pick something up from "from" you want to disable date in "to", right?
[04:25:34] <hellyeah> yes
[04:25:34] <snowman44> what exactly means "pick something up" ?
[04:25:46] <hellyeah> like you select 5 in from i disable 1,2,3,4,5
[04:25:46] <snowman44> the datepicker?
[04:25:59] <hellyeah> datepicker
[04:27:03] <snowman44> oh i see, that calendar thing you always see when booking a flight or so, right? so if you pick 5 in from you cant pick anything smaller than 5 in to
[04:28:43] <hellyeah> yes
[04:28:50] <hellyeah> we can think that way
[04:29:06] <hellyeah> the date you select in "to" has to be bigger then 5 right?
[04:29:40] <snowman44> yes
[04:30:46] <hellyeah> do you know how to do that?
[04:31:14] <snowman44> selectable dates in "to" should be bigger than the selected date in "from" - if you want to allow one day trips bigger or equal
[04:32:29] <hellyeah> hmm actually i think i can allow user to select same day
[04:32:40] <hellyeah> yeah bigger or equal
[04:33:08] <snowman44> well, you need to do 2 things: 1. when you pick a date for "from" you should visually modify all the dates before the picked date, make them grey or something. 2. when you pick a date for "to" you need to have an if that checks for bigger or equal "picked date of from"
[04:33:51] <snowman44> if the if fails just do nothing, if the if has success, well, do your thing and pick the date
[04:34:15] <hellyeah> but let say user pick 5 from 10 to
[04:34:25] <hellyeah> but user can create more then once field
[04:34:31] <hellyeah> click create button
[04:34:36] <hellyeah> they can still 1-4
[04:35:00] <snowman44> but not 5-10 anymore?
[04:35:10] <hellyeah> yes
[04:35:21] <hellyeah> they can create same element as many time as they want
[04:35:27] <hellyeah> and pick different dates
[04:35:44] <hellyeah> for example in the next element they cannot choose between 5-10
[04:36:04] <hellyeah> buut also i need to avoid if you pick 5 from "from" you cannot select 4 from "to"
[04:36:11] <hellyeah> so there is two cases i need to avoid
[04:36:56] <snowman44> well, you need something that stores the picked dates, let's say an array. so you could initialize the array empty at the start.
[04:37:16] <hellyeah> actually i got this already
[04:37:28] <hellyeah> pick some dates and click get between dates
[04:37:31] <snowman44> the create button should iterate through the array, with a for loop for example, and grey out the dates you find. and before that reset all the greyed ones
[04:37:42] <hellyeah> you will see al dats and between dates are stored in an array
[04:37:43] <ace_me> anyone please can share a jqvalidate for a file upload ?
[04:37:52] <misterpilou> hi, i have an array compose of 2 other array, he's compose of [Array[2], Array[3], Array[1], Array[2], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1]], how can i select the elements of the first array in my array?
[04:38:23] <hellyeah> snowman44: in my design getbetweendates iterates is it false approach?
[04:38:24] <snowman44> oh yeah you do the date.push(between), right?
[04:38:30] <hellyeah> yes
[04:39:01] <hellyeah> but may be i need to do foreach when you create "create" button
[04:39:10] <hellyeah> that can disable the date
[04:39:17] <hellyeah> that can solve my problem
[04:39:32] <snowman44> yeah, sounds legit to me
[04:39:50] <snowman44> also, what kind of input do you have? is it a calendar or a text field or what?
[04:40:13] <hellyeah> jquery ui datepicker
[04:40:22] <hellyeah> it seems it is input box and calendar
[04:40:24] <snowman44> oh yeah i see.
[04:40:55] <hellyeah> actually third thing i need to do is http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/38/
[04:41:06] <hellyeah> disable all the dates in seperate calendar for visuality
[04:41:29] <hellyeah> so there is three cases here
[04:41:36] <hellyeah> but let me think about this
[04:41:38] <snowman44> yeah you can do that if you store all the dates, what you already do, in an array. just pass that array over and iterate through and disable the picked dates
[04:42:27] <snowman44> i haven't worked with the datepicker ui yet, but i'm sure you can disable dates there, there surely is something built for that already
[04:42:32] <hellyeah> snowman44: but when you click some dates in from i need disable smaller dates in "to" there must be function or smt for that
[04:42:51] <hellyeah> there is beforeshowday
[04:43:10] <hellyeah> but i am not sure it works for disabling dates in "to"
[04:43:12] <hellyeah> i dont know
[04:44:26] <snowman44> you could make a variable that works in the scope of both, and when you click on the text field first thing you do is check the array, then use beforeshowday
[04:44:50] <hellyeah> let me see what i can do
[04:44:58] <hellyeah> i just have some idea now
[04:45:29] <hellyeah> well
[04:45:34] <hellyeah> there is also mindate
[04:45:57] <hellyeah> while(minDate <= currentDate)
[04:46:05] <hellyeah> currentdate = currentdate -1;
[04:46:10] <hellyeah> and push it to array
[04:46:14] <hellyeah> i can do smt like that
[04:51:13] <HexSquid> leave
[04:52:32] <misterpilou> Hi everyone, i have an array compose of arrays like [Array[2], Array[3], Array[1], Array[2], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1]], i want to select the first element of the first array, how can i do that?
[04:52:44] <misterpilou> the code is here: https://jsfiddle.net/m2mztqtu/
[04:58:38] <stinkychinky> can someone tell me what the hell is wrong with my code please?
[05:01:08] <Cork> stinkychinky: i recommend asking is ##psychic
[05:01:19] <misterpilou> Hi everyone, i have an array compose of arrays like [Array[2], Array[3], Array[1], Array[2], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1]], i want to select the first element of the first array, how can i do that?
[05:01:19] <stinkychinky> https://jsfiddle.net/kn574cvg/
[05:01:22] <Cork> or actually post a jsfiddle with the code
[05:01:29] <misterpilou> https://jsfiddle.net/m2mztqtu/
[05:01:31] <stinkychinky> my problem is that every time i click the add button it's not adding a row
[05:01:35] <stinkychinky> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/kn574cvg/
[05:01:37] <stinkychinky> here it is
[05:01:40] <stinkychinky> i can't append a row :(
[05:01:50] <Cork> misterpilou: arr[0][0]
[05:02:20] <Cork> stinkychinky: delegate the click handler
[05:02:30] <stinkychinky> what does that mean?
[05:02:33] <Cork> currently you bind it to the buttons that exist
[05:02:40] <Cork> but when you add more they don't have an event handler
[05:02:47] <likecolacola> is if(foo instanceof $) { //.. } a good way of checking if an object is Jquery?, like $(foo), it seems to work but am not sure
[05:02:59] <stinkychinky> so what should i do cork?
[05:03:03] <Cork> stinkychinky: $('static-parent-selector').on('click', .add-contact', func)
[05:03:14] <Cork> stinkychinky: * $('static-parent-selector').on('click', '.add-contact', func)
[05:03:17] <stinkychinky> oh... this is very interesting
[05:03:22] <Cork> likecolacola: no
[05:03:35] <Cork> likecolacola: check $.fn.jquery

[05:07:55] <tony0998> Hello everyone!
[05:08:12] <tony0998> I'm looking to replicate google's Resumable file upload API for my own use
[05:08:13] <sstinkychinky> cork it's only showing my very first message
[05:08:13] <tony0998> https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/manage-uploads#resumable
[05:08:31] <Cork> sstinkychinky: it is a bit delayed
[05:08:32] <tony0998> and I was thinking of using a jQuery to do the upload
[05:08:39] <tony0998> has anyone tried anything similar?
[05:09:16] <tony0998> (a jquery = a jquery _plugin_, this being the plugin: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload )
[05:09:26] <misterpilou>  Hi everyone, i have an array compose of arrays like [Array[2], Array[3], Array[1], Array[2], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1], Array[1]], i want to select the properties of arrays in the array, how can i do that? Here's the code: https://jsfiddle.net/m2mztqtu/
[05:09:32] <sstinkychinky> cork can you please post the stuff you typed to a pastebin or something?
[05:09:39] <Cork> misterpilou: i already answered that
[05:09:52] <Cork> sstinkychinky: just read the lear page
[05:09:53] <misterpilou> yes but i express myself badly
[05:09:56] <Cork> it is really quite simple
[05:10:04] <sstinkychinky> lear page?
[05:10:14] <Cork> *learn
[05:10:50] <Cork> misterpilou: what properties are you talking about?
[05:11:02] <misterpilou> the shelfheight
[05:11:12] <misterpilou> i said properties i mean property
[05:11:23] <Cork> so the arrays aren't arrays?
[05:11:28] <Cork> but objects?
[05:11:31] <misterpilou> yes
[05:11:59] <Cork> ok so you have an array of objects and want to build an array with just the values of a single property in the objects?
[05:12:44] <sstinkychinky> i know it's simple to you but it's really hard for me
[05:12:52] <misterpilou> yes kinda
[05:13:07] <Cork> misterpilou: i recommend replacing the for loops with $.map becomes much more readable
[05:13:38] <Cork> ah, no you combine multiple sources
[05:13:42] <Cork> so forget that one
[05:13:49] <ohcibi> does anyone know how to fake a file drop on a dropzone.js drop upload? i tried it like this: https://jsfiddle.net/ohcibi/hwr68tLq/ but there is nothing happening.. i want this to do for tests
[05:13:56] <Cork> misterpilou: anyway ya, you would have to loop the array and build it from it
[05:18:00] <misterpilou> <Cork>
[05:18:06] <misterpilou> ok thank you
[05:22:47] <Mark__> can anyone help me with this particular js plugin called YTplayer? for some reason, it wonâ€™t initiate. https://github.com/pupunzi/jquery.mb.YTPlayer
[05:24:31] <silverdust> Should I debounce all my inputs that are submitted with $.ajax() ?
[05:25:40] <Cork> uh debounce?
[05:26:09] <Cork> you have to serialize the values from the inputs you can't post the elements
[05:26:54] <silverdust> I mean the submit event (input handler)
[05:27:25] <Mark__> nvm, i think i fixed it.
[05:27:47] <silverdust> i.e if user clicks submit they shouldn't be able to do it again in the next 100ms
[05:28:33] <silverdust> Because there are cases user will double-click the submit and it may submit twice
[05:31:34] <silverdust> Cork: do you get what my question is?
[05:32:42] <silverdust> I just wanted to know if it's something worth introducing lodash lib for or if there's a jquery way to achieve the same debounce effect without me haivng to write my own fn
[06:02:15] <km4> enyone use froala ? (www.froala.com)
[06:48:55] <hellyeah> yo
[06:49:05] <hellyeah> closest and find function can be thought as similar
[07:03:49] <jw4000> hi, is it possible to get access to the resouce links in loaded fonts on page with js?
[07:07:39] <silverdust> hellyeah: closest goes up the dom while find goes down but yea they work similarly in opposite directions

[07:18:57] <TennisB> so not sure why its breaking :(
[07:35:06] <hellyeah> can you check line 51 i just try to disable pervios input boxes when you create second element  http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/548/
[07:52:43] <snowman44> hellyeah is it not working like it is?
[07:52:46] <snowman44> you try it already?
[07:53:52] <Ice_Strike> bootstrap selector .hide I use <div class="operation hide"> to hide it. On jquery $('operations').show(); will not show the div?
[07:54:15] <snowman44> should say $('.operation') shouldnt it?
[07:54:33] <snowman44> but i have no idea about bootstrap tho ^^
[07:54:59] <Ice_Strike> Typo but yes it is $('.operations')
[07:55:15] <snowman44> so your class is "operations hide"?
[07:55:46] <Ice_Strike> Ah found this topic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14610412/jquery-show-for-twitter-bootstrap-css-class-hidden
[07:56:00] <Ice_Strike> Working now, changed .hide to .collapse
[07:56:06] <snowman44> kk^^
[07:56:21] <Ice_Strike> Don't mind checking my code for feedback?
[07:56:31] <Ice_Strike> Small though :P
[07:56:46] <snowman44> i dont know anything about bootstrap tho haha
[07:57:03] <Ice_Strike> It mostly jquery
[07:57:12] <snowman44> well if it's small let me have a look ^^
[07:57:26] <Ice_Strike> ok, 1 minute
[08:02:09] <nytek> Can someone please help me figure out why I cannot add a second number anymore? If I hit an operator sign like 'plus', and then click more numbers...they no longer register. http://jsfiddle.net/nytek/q25y7nan/20/

[08:15:05] <worknick> hi
[08:15:57] <Ice_Strike> snowman44 Great thanks.
[08:16:06] <misterpilou> hi, i have an array with 3 properties: an id, a height and a type, how can i select the height of an element which his type is 1?
[08:16:08] <worknick> i am doing infinite scrolling in my rails. its loading a set of post and its comment. the comment is hidden by default. but when the next page set of post and commetns automatically load they are not hidden. i am setting them hidden on jq on document ready page load. how to make those newly loaded comments to hide?
[08:16:49] <worknick> i think i can use css.
[08:17:12] <snowman44> misterpilou iterate through the array, first if looks for type, if the type matches next if looks for the height you want to select
[08:17:23] <snowman44> or am i misunderstanding this :D
[08:21:52] <hellyeah> when yuou create two elements i try to disable pervious input boxes. Can you take a look line 51 what did i do wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/548/
[08:24:40] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to determine if a ul class has a li class with this https://jsfiddle.net/qejj5y3q/ but I get an error. Any suggestion please?
[08:26:54] <snowman44> hellyeah what is going to happen once you put the attrbiute disabled to true?
[08:28:23] <hellyeah> snowman44: nothing happened
[08:30:19] <snowman44> oh ok
[08:30:23] <snowman44> wait a sec ^^
[08:32:03] <snowman44> hellyeah add $('.datePart').children().attr('disabled',true); bevore line 4 instead of your function, makes more sense
[08:32:10] <snowman44> before*
[09:45:24] <hellyeah> hey
[09:46:02] <hellyeah> pls check line 48 the second part of if. What i try to do disable pervious element when it is not empty http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/551/
[09:47:07] <sanjayb> hellyeah, not sure what you're doing, but it seems to me you might want (!$('.datePart .datepicker .input').val() === ""))
[09:47:11] <sanjayb> instead of (!$('.datePart .datepicker .input').val("")))
[09:47:23] <hellyeah> humm
[09:47:30] <sanjayb> calling .val("") SETS the value to empty string
[09:47:32] <hellyeah> you understand what i try to do actually
[09:47:40] <hellyeah> ic
[09:47:51] <sanjayb> if you want to CHECK if the value is an empty string, you call val with no parameters and it returns the current value.
[09:48:06] <hellyeah> i just try to disable pervious element when it is not empty they have datapicker ability
[09:48:20] <taplar> hellyeah:you really need to learn about contexts...
[09:48:35] <taplar> $('.datepicker .input')
[09:48:43] <taplar> that's going to find all of them
[09:49:04] <taplar> we've mentioned this numerous times
[09:49:07] <hellyeah> taplar: there is other datapicker i dont want to use
[09:49:18] <hellyeah> outside of datePart
[09:49:32] <hellyeah> i dont want to use datepicker outside of datePart
[09:49:42] <hellyeah> thats why i stated .datePart
[09:50:01] <taplar> how does .datePart affect that selector?
[09:50:40] <hellyeah> there is datepickerPart
[09:50:55] <taplar> "What i try to do disable pervious element when it is not empty"
[09:50:59] <hellyeah> you can see datepicker there if i dont use datePart in the beginning
[09:51:02] <taplar> so you have to identify what that previous element is
[09:51:10] <taplar> and that is your context your wanting to work against
[09:51:11] <hellyeah> i will get datepicker in the datepickerPart
[09:51:12] <taplar> not a global lookup
[09:51:21] <hellyeah> i just want to rule this out
[09:51:53] <hellyeah> yeah i have to identify pervious element
[09:52:34] <hellyeah> i did global lookup again?
[09:53:00] <taplar> ANYTHING $(selector) is a global lookup
[09:53:36] <hellyeah> i understand
[09:53:42] <hellyeah> but i am checking the length
[09:53:57] <hellyeah> for cheking this i need global lookup i guess
[09:54:00] <hellyeah> is that false?
[09:54:00] <taplar> so?
[09:54:40] <taplar> if i want to know how many cars are in my state, and i first check to see if there are cars in my state, and then i turn around and try to find all cars in the united states.  how is that valid?
[09:54:41] <hellyeah> you said i dont need to check that?
[09:55:48] <taplar> you need to perform your logic in your context
[09:55:53] <hellyeah> create button will guarantee there is a car in your state
[09:56:06] <hellyeah> if you create more than one element
[09:56:12] <hellyeah> disable pervious element
[09:56:18] <hellyeah> this logic is false?
[09:56:19] <taplar> so you have to identify the previous element
[09:56:27] <hellyeah> yes
[09:56:35] <taplar> and -then- evaluate the elements in -that-, not every where
[09:57:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:57:39] <hellyeah> you mean i guess when you click "create" button it will check this everytime over and over again is it?
[09:58:20] <taplar> no, not your not hearing me
[09:58:24] <taplar> *your
[09:58:38] <taplar> your only concerned with the previous element
[09:58:56] <taplar> $('.datePart .datepicker .input')
[09:58:59] <taplar> that finds them all
[09:59:09] <taplar> you have no context
[09:59:21] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[09:59:31] <hellyeah> yeah you are right
[09:59:38] <hellyeah> i just need pervious input
[09:59:49] <taplar> also a side note, don't think it was mentioned
[09:59:50] <taplar> $('.datePart .datepicker').length > 1
[10:00:00] <taplar> isn't there two already?  a from and a to?
[10:00:09] <taplar> so that would always be true after the first creation
[10:00:11] <taplar> brb
[10:00:31] <hellyeah> yea
[10:15:35] <hellyeah> i need this file  jqueryui 1.9.2
[10:44:37] <taplar> hmm?
[10:50:15] <ABM_Dan> Please check line 28, would that work for having onRefresh call the same function as onChange? https://gist.github.com/ABM-Dan/70316682296df8e044fb
[10:54:02] <taplar> should
[10:54:35] <taplar> well, since i don't know what plugin your going to be using it with i'll just say, it will make those two properties be the same method
[10:54:50] <taplar> *reference
[10:55:34] <ABM_Dan> I see.
[10:55:40] <ABM_Dan> Is there a more elegant way to do it?
[10:55:47] <taplar> nah
[10:55:51] <ABM_Dan> Like when declaring the object?
[10:55:55] <ABM_Dan> Oh, ok.
[10:55:59] <taplar> you could do that sure
[10:56:07] <ABM_Dan> how?
[10:56:17] <taplar> well i think you can, hold on
[10:56:28] * ABM_Dan holds on
[10:57:20] <taplar> ok, no not directly
[10:57:29] <taplar> you'd have to do a little change
[10:57:40] <ABM_Dan> How so?
[10:59:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/72hgs3b9/
[11:00:26] <ABM_Dan> hm, I have to wrap it.
[11:00:31] <taplar> i think your way is cleaner
[11:00:35] <ABM_Dan> I think I will stick with my version yeah.
[11:00:37] <taplar> or something like the first one
[11:00:45] <ABM_Dan> That sucks and rocks at the same time :)
[11:00:55] <ABM_Dan> Thanks taplar. Very much appreciated.
[11:01:04] <taplar> well, the object doesn't exist yet, so you can't reference parts of it until after the fact
[11:04:27] <bonks> Currently I am registering an event handler at a page level. But I want to move this handler closer to the shared component which can have multiple instance on a page as well. The component is loaded (with its script) at any time. What is the best approach to ensure the event handler is registered only once per page?
[11:05:05] <taplar> attach it to a parent element that already exists
[11:05:20] <taplar> like your doing with the body (?) currently, just go for a lower parent
[11:05:53] <bonks> Ok, but since the script is executed every time a component loads, I need to check if it is already registered right?
[11:06:34] <taplar> is there not a parent that exists regardless prior, during, and after any component loads? (other than body)?
[11:07:42] <bonks> taplar: There is, but the component doesn't have knowledge of the parent. I'm doing this in ASP.NET MVC using partial views. The component is part of the partial view with its script and can be included in the main view many times
[11:08:03] <taplar> you shouldn't do the binding in the component load
[11:08:53] <taplar> not for delegates at least
[11:09:21] <bonks> Ok, I'll admit it felt wrong. The issue I have is for all my pages which uses this component, I have to register the same handler on those page's scripts
[11:09:39] <bonks> They are almost identical but not exactly
[11:10:12] <taplar> ok, so a middle ground
[11:10:28] <taplar> these components your including, possibly multiple times
[11:10:53] <taplar> are they being fully created, fully removed variably?
[11:11:21] <bonks> Yes
[11:11:46] <taplar> ok, so i can include component A.  at some point i may completely remove A and readd it at a future time
[11:12:37] <taplar> in that case another option would be to give each of these components their own wrapper
[11:12:43] <taplar> if they don't already have one
[11:12:46] <bonks> Yes basically. It is a module within a container. This container loads many kinds of modules with a breadcrumb to go back and forth
[11:13:02] <taplar> and do your binding on those.  at which point if they are removed, that binding will be removed with them
[11:14:31] <taplar> and since you'll be binding only on the newly created components, there won't be any duplication and you don't have to worry about if it's already bound or not
[11:14:58] <bonks> A wrapper.. hmm. I may already have this. I guess the problem is the minor difference in the event handler. "On fire, direct the action to this div. For this other page, on fire, direct the action to another div (or multiple divs), but add these additional actions.
[11:15:52] <taplar> if your delegate binding is on the container wrapper, you don't have that issue
[11:16:01] <taplar> events from other components won't be picked up by that handler
[11:16:06] <taplar> (unless components are nested)
[11:17:21] <taplar> remember, delegate binding relies on bubbled events.  and events bubble up from child to parent, not down or to siblings
[11:18:05] <jeffreylevesque> you guys ever create conditional webforms
[11:18:16] <jeffreylevesque> if so, what kind of templating mechanism do you use?
[11:18:41] <taplar> not entirely sure i know what you are referring to with 'webforms'
[11:25:02] <taplar> you talking about a <form>?

The return is a string containing html text.. ex: @mydata = "hello<br/>world" presently its rendering it as simple text and does not render the line break. What is the best approach to rendering this in the browser as proper html.
[11:48:56] <NoiseEee> KineticX: someElement.html(mydata)  vs someElement.text(mydatat)

[12:04:40] <_TWG_> I have a JSON array that has multiple entries. I'm trying to run through the entries and show only the unique ones.  How can I do that?
[12:47:16] <claytonzaugg> Is there a way to wrap many <div> tags with one function?  Like "wrap the following children"
[13:05:48] <taplar> hot macaronii!
[13:06:15] <taplar> claytonzaugg:that seems like an append, might be a wrap all method.
[13:06:17] * taplar googles
[13:06:42] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/wrapall/
[13:06:44] <taplar> a boom
[13:08:06] <claytonzaugg> Yeah been reading about it now.  Trying to find some stackoverflow examples
[13:15:31] <taplar> _TWG_:json array?
[13:32:43] <bonks> Is there a cleaner way to do var name = '#' + container.attr('id'); so I have a string with the # prefix?
[13:33:10] <taplar> not really
[13:33:41] <taplar> though having the variable be 'name' is a little strange, :P
[13:34:24] <bonks> True :P
[13:34:26] <bonks> thx
[13:35:32] <tsukasa__> anyone here good at jqgrid?
[13:36:01] <tsukasa__> i've been trying to solve this problem for a while now... trying to make my dropdown boxes multiselect and it's not working :(
[13:40:48] <taplar> tsukasa__: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10847644/is-there-anyway-to-include-a-multiselect-combobox-in-a-jqgrid  the all mighty googs!!
[13:41:21] <tsukasa__> taplar yeah i've seen that
[13:41:32] <tsukasa__> i'm trying to get it working in phpgrid
[13:41:42] <taplar> so many grids
[13:41:43] <tsukasa__> which is essentially jqgrid wrapped in helper methods
[13:42:06] <tsukasa__> so i'm trying to turn on multiselect manually
[13:42:13] <tsukasa__> eg with a jquery command on document load
[13:42:24] <tsukasa__> but the plugin doesn't really work that way
[13:42:29] <tsukasa__> as far as i can tell anyway
[13:43:56] <tsukasa__> taplar: like, basically i'm not sure how to override edittype once the document has loaded from jquery
[14:04:49] <hellyeah> taplar: you there?
[14:04:54] <taplar> yup
[14:05:14] <hellyeah> if you dont mind can you give me last link i posted here i am at home
[14:05:25] <taplar> checkout irc.jquery.com
[14:05:47] <hellyeah> ,okeyu thank i just asked :)
[14:06:25] <taplar> looks like this was it http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/551/
[14:07:35] <hellyeah> can we discuss about it?
[14:07:41] <taplar> sure
[14:07:45] <hellyeah> if you have time
[14:07:51] <hellyeah> okey thanks
[14:09:01] <wa5ted> yo
[14:09:06] <wa5ted> wher eis the lve
[14:09:29] <taplar> you trying to black eyed peas us?
[14:09:59] <hellyeah> firstly i check length > 1 because i need to disable pervious element. I could check datepicker exist by picking element directly like that if($('...')) am i false here?
[14:10:12] <taplar> what are you counting?
[14:11:53] <taplar> ah!
[14:11:55] <taplar> nvm
[14:12:02] <taplar> i thought you put the datepicker class on the inputs
[14:12:18] <taplar> blah blah blah, anyway.  ok
[14:12:29] <hellyeah> did i say smt wrong?
[14:12:43] <taplar> no i wasn't looking close enough at the markup
[14:13:01] <hellyeah> ic
[14:13:04] <taplar> ok, so you count them and if there are atleast two, what else?
[14:13:22] <hellyeah> if there is at least two disable pervious one
[14:13:31] <hellyeah> i did that because
[14:15:09] <taplar> what is line 48 doing?
[14:15:10] <hellyeah> they can create several datapicker and select different dates but if they choose dats like 5-12 as day they cannot choose those dates in next element. So i will disable those dates in next element. I disabled that because i want to restrict user to choose the date from pervious element from over and over again. Hope my english is understadable and
[14:15:11] <hellyeah> it make sense
[14:15:20] <hellyeah> this is what my purpose is
[14:16:15] <hellyeah> line 48 do if there is at least two date pickers and those datepickers are not empty disable pervious element to avoid user change the dates
[14:16:26] <taplar> that's not what it's doing
[14:16:48] <hellyeah> well i try to make this happen ofc it doesnt work like that
[14:16:54] <taplar> so what is it doing?
[14:16:56] <hellyeah> but  at least do i make sense?
[14:17:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:17:46] <hellyeah> let me check again
[14:18:37] <cetabio> hi
[14:18:49] <cetabio> had someone make a select2 dropdown dependent on other?
[14:19:28] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/553/
[14:19:44] <hellyeah> does it seem correct now?
[14:20:18] <taplar> better, but not done
[14:20:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:20:31] <taplar> $('.datePart .datepicker .input')
[14:20:36] <taplar> what does that get you
[14:20:36] <hellyeah> okey
[14:20:39] <aniasis> what up!
[14:20:41] <hellyeah> this is global lookup
[14:20:45] <taplar> yup
[14:20:59] <hellyeah> give me everything i just need pervious element() of current one
[14:21:02] <hellyeah> give me a sec
[14:21:18] <taplar> btw, why are you doing this in a second click binding?
[14:22:01] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/554/
[14:22:24] <hellyeah> thats another issue
[14:22:27] <hellyeah> yes
[14:22:33] <hellyeah> there is a mistake here
[14:22:42] <hellyeah> give me a sec i fix smt
[14:22:57] <hellyeah> actually i sepearete these
[14:23:15] <taplar> y?
[14:24:28] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/555/
[14:25:09] <taplar> y have two click events?
[14:25:43] <hellyeah> aha
[14:26:42] <hellyeah> i try to make this more readable
[14:27:01] <hellyeah> does it make any harm
[14:27:02] <taplar> so call functions from within the single event
[14:27:22] <taplar> it's unnecessary extra work
[14:27:29] <duch_kazatel> *event handler.
[14:27:34] <duch_kazatel> and it makes it far more readable.
[14:27:36] <taplar> and you have to make sure they bind in the correct order as you expect them to
[14:28:22] <hellyeah> like that http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/556/
[14:28:50] <taplar> i'm going to have to tidy this some...
[14:30:18] <hellyeah> thanks
[14:30:29] <hellyeah> tidy you mean indentation
[14:31:43] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/558/
[14:31:58] <taplar> ok, and i moved your clone logic above your other as that's originally how you had your bindings working
[14:32:28] <taplar> i also took out the comments.  you can always look at previous fiddles to get them again
[14:33:13] <taplar> ok, so
[14:33:22] <taplar> $('.datePart .datepicker ').find('.input').prev().val()
[14:33:24] <taplar> what is that doing
[14:33:45] <hellyeah> i actuall y have to develop my commenting skills
[14:33:55] <taplar> you want to develop your self documenting skills
[14:34:14] <hellyeah> select datepicker find the current one get the value of pervious element
[14:34:24] <hellyeah> this is what i try to do
[14:34:27] <taplar> current one?
[14:34:33] <hellyeah> but i am not so good ith those function
[14:34:49] <hellyeah> for example you create two elements
[14:34:51] <taplar> $('.datePart .datepicker ') <-- what does that return
[14:35:09] <hellyeah> all datepicker it is global lookup again right
[14:35:12] <hellyeah> :p
[14:35:12] <taplar> k
[14:35:22] <taplar> $('.datePart .datepicker ').find('.input') <-- what about that?
[14:36:30] <hellyeah> if you create two elements
[14:36:45] <hellyeah> it will find you last datepicker "second"
[14:36:52] <taplar> no
[14:37:01] <taplar> what is it returning?
[14:37:08] <taplar> you selected all the datepicker's
[14:37:14] <taplar> and now your selecting...
[14:38:09] <hellyeah> all input?
[14:38:13] <taplar> yep
[14:38:18] <taplar> within the datepickers
[14:38:22] <hellyeah> damn
[14:38:30] <hellyeah> i supposed i just selected last one
[14:38:36] <taplar> y?
[14:38:38] <hellyeah> it doesnt make senese actually
[14:38:40] <hellyeah> :o
[14:39:02] <taplar> you know what find() does.  it's not going to magically do something else, :P
[14:39:14] <hellyeah> yes
[14:39:28] <hellyeah> but what i need to do is to choose last datepickers
[14:39:37] <hellyeah> i guess there must be last() function
[14:39:38] <taplar> ok, how do you do that?
[14:39:47] <taplar> but hold on a sec
[14:39:59] <taplar> do you want the last one?  cause you just created a new one
[14:40:06] <hellyeah> okey i hold my breathe
[14:40:34] <hellyeah> last().prev()?
[14:40:42] <taplar> is there any other way?
[14:40:53] <hellyeah> find('.input').last().prev()
[14:40:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:41:02] <hellyeah> let me reckon
[14:41:06] <taplar> the one your trying to target, is the next to the last one right?
[14:41:21] <hellyeah> yes
[14:41:31] <hellyeah> you create one actually this is the last
[14:41:35] <taplar> so before this event handler started processing, it -was- the last one, right?
[14:42:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:42:29] <hellyeah> yes
[14:42:38] <taplar> can we get that?
[14:42:42] <hellyeah> i can get check outside hander
[14:42:49] <taplar> inside
[14:43:01] <hellyeah> inside click
[14:43:14] <taplar> it's the last one until you insert a new one
[14:43:29] <taplar> and actually your new one your inserting after the existing last one, right?
[14:43:34] <taplar> logically
[14:43:46] <hellyeah> ye
[14:44:05] <hellyeah> but it is the last when you click "create" new one is the last
[14:44:14] <taplar> yep
[14:44:21] <taplar> unless it's the first one, but lets disregard that for now
[14:44:49] <hellyeah> sure
[14:45:06] <taplar> so can we get the last one before create the new one?
[14:45:57] <hellyeah> ye sure
[14:46:16] <taplar> dew it hombre
[14:46:24] <hellyeah> i need to do that before clone operation
[14:46:33] <hellyeah> dew it hombre?
[14:46:49] <hellyeah> what does that mean?
[14:46:49] <taplar> me being stupid
[14:46:52] <taplar> do it man
[14:47:38] <hellyeah> well
[14:47:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:48:23] <hellyeah> but there is one issue
[14:48:38] <hellyeah> you have to click "create" at least one
[14:49:00] <taplar> what do you mean?
[14:49:50] <hellyeah> before clicking create there is no element called datePart datepicker
[14:49:55] <taplar> true
[14:50:13] <taplar> and?
[14:50:38] <hellyeah> i guess it is done on my mind
[14:50:51] <hellyeah> after clone operation i can check it iss empty or not
[14:50:56] <taplar> :)
[14:51:04] <hellyeah> is it wrong?
[14:51:09] <taplar> nope
[14:51:14] <taplar> do it man!
[14:53:14] <hellyeah> i am sure it is false but http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/559/
[14:53:42] <taplar> uh, what did you do
[14:54:27] <hellyeah> let ne think again
[14:54:37] <hellyeah> damn it
[14:54:41] <hellyeah> me being stupid
[14:54:50] <taplar> no clue.  not sure what you changed
[14:55:07] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/560/
[14:55:32] <taplar> what did you change?
[14:55:54] <hellyeah> if ($('.datePart .datepicker ').find('.input').last().val() !== "")
[14:56:09] <taplar> how is that related to looking the guy up before you clone?
[14:56:48] <hellyeah> after clone?
[14:57:00] <hellyeah> after clone check the last one is empty or not?
[14:57:12] <taplar> lol what have we been talking about, -_-
[14:57:43] <taplar> if you look up the last datepicker before you clone, you don't have to do any funky prev() business
[14:57:43] <hellyeah> damn right
[14:58:09] <hellyeah> but for one time i need to clone it
[14:58:22] <taplar> you will clone
[14:58:38] <taplar> but we want the last one before the clone is added
[14:59:29] <hellyeah> clone.appendTo('.datePart'); ?
[14:59:36] <taplar> how is that a lookup
[14:59:55] <taplar> yes, before that line
[15:00:10] <taplar> after that line, last is not the one we want to disable
[15:02:29] <hellyeah> taplar: forgive me i am stupid but can i ask something about one thing?
[15:02:35] <taplar> always
[15:03:30] <hellyeah> basically you say we check input box is empty or not before appending riht? am i correct?
[15:03:46] <taplar> no, we find the last datepicker
[15:03:57] <taplar> validation comes later
[15:04:20] <jquery698> yes
[15:04:33] <jquery698> hello
[15:04:36] <hellyeah> okey last datapicker is the one you add to datePart
[15:04:43] <taplar> no
[15:04:50] <taplar> well, the NEW last one, yes
[15:05:06] <taplar> but we want the last one as of the clicking of the create, before the new one is added
[15:06:35] <hellyeah> we want the ONE before clicking?
[15:06:44] <taplar> the last one, yes
[15:07:08] <taplar> you have n datepicker elements
[15:07:18] <taplar> on click, you create an n+1 datepicker
[15:07:23] <hellyeah> i guess we need to select datepicker before appending to datepicker
[15:07:32] <taplar> but your wanting to conditionally disable the n'th one, not n+1
[15:07:36] <taplar> YES!
[15:07:37] <taplar> lol
[15:07:42] * taplar cries
[15:07:53] <arc_> D:
[15:08:40] * hellyeah admire taplar
[15:08:55] <taplar> ok, so again.  do it man!

[15:12:06] <taplar> yeah
[15:12:09] <hellyeah> ah ye
[15:12:16] <taplar> they had to be, heh
[15:12:22] <hellyeah> btw am i correct track http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/561/
[15:12:33] <hellyeah> taplar: metaphor is hard issue to get immediately
[15:12:37] <taplar> wow their landing page is really white
[15:13:22] <taplar> ok, what did you change?
[15:14:39] <hellyeah> var $datePart = $('.datePart');
[15:14:39] <hellyeah>     clone.appendTo($datePart);
[15:15:08] <taplar> ok.  i'm still not seeing a datepicker lookup
[15:15:20] <Sarelle> damn
[15:17:41] <Sarelle> can you give me some code help taplar?
[15:17:55] <duch_kazatel> what was the question?
[15:17:59] <taplar> you already have lookups for datepicker
[15:18:05] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm haha
[15:18:12] <taplar> nick change confustion?
[15:18:13] <taplar> :)
[15:18:16] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:18:23] <Sarelle> xD
[15:18:54] <Sarelle> taplar:   var clone = $('#datepickerPart').clone();
[15:18:57] <Sarelle> ?
[15:19:13] <taplar> we're after the datepicker's that already exist
[15:19:20] <taplar> prior to adding a new one
[15:22:23] <Sarelle> datepickerpart is not empty
[15:22:41] <taplar> that's not our search target
[15:23:16] <Sarelle> input is
[15:23:22] <taplar> .datepicker is
[15:26:33] <Sarelle> my mind stopped
[15:26:43] <taplar> what's confusing?
[15:27:10] <Sarelle> so we select datepicker before appending datepart
[15:27:20] <Sarelle> when we select that it is last one
[15:27:24] <taplar> you don't append datepart.  you append to datepart
[15:27:39] <Sarelle> sorry right
[15:27:48] <Sarelle> i am appending to datepart
[15:28:02] <Sarelle> if we select datepicker before appending to datepart
[15:28:10] <Sarelle> we can guarantee it is the last one
[15:28:28] <taplar> yep, if we get the last one
[15:28:32] <Sarelle> is that correcnt? selecting before appending?
[15:28:38] <taplar> yep
[15:30:02] <BillCriswell> http://ejohn.org/blog/10th-anniversary-of-jquery/
[15:30:43] <Sarelle> so it is http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/563/
[15:31:39] <taplar> you have Picker camel cased, and that is a global lookup, so it would find the one in your template
[15:32:03] <Sarelle> is it false?
[15:32:09] <taplar> it is false
[15:32:27] <taplar> you only want the ones inside your datepart
[15:32:35] <taplar> no?
[15:34:13] <Sarelle> so http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/564/
[15:34:38] <taplar> .datePicker ?
[15:34:59] <taplar> class="datepicker hidden"
[15:35:15] <Sarelle> sorry typo
[15:35:38] <Sarelle> but before appending we dont have any datepicker in datePart?
[15:36:20] <taplar> might not.  but there might be
[15:36:26] <taplar> could be the second click
[15:36:34] <Sarelle> right
[15:36:37] <Sarelle> sorry
[15:36:54] <Sarelle> actually i am in front of computer 12 hours more or less
[15:37:02] <Sarelle> my mind is slow down little bit
[15:37:08] <taplar> when did you last take a break?
[15:37:14] <Sarelle> in the second click we wil have
[15:37:26] <Sarelle> well i come to my home from my job
[15:37:34] <Sarelle> it was my break
[15:37:35] <taplar> not an answer, :)
[15:37:42] <Sarelle> this was not resting
[15:37:50] <taplar> take a break dude
[15:37:52] <taplar> relax your brain
[15:38:18] <Sarelle> now i am really close to get my promotion
[15:38:29] <Sarelle> i have to force myself
[15:38:39] <Sarelle> thanks for helping sincrely appreciated
[15:38:47] <taplar> the longer you go without a break the less likely you'll remember
[15:38:51] <Sarelle> taplar: now i write my own stuff
[15:38:52] <taplar> and our goal is to teach you this stuff
[15:39:08] <Sarelle> and also i am helping other projects
[15:39:23] <Sarelle> taplar: i just try to handle some minor cases
[15:39:36] <Sarelle> i wont do any big design or smt
[15:39:37] <taplar> just one more thing.  just a little more.  i'm almost there
[15:39:42] <taplar> none of those are taking a break
[15:40:41] <Sarelle> lets do that small step
[15:40:48] <Sarelle> and i will take a break :)
[15:40:53] <taplar> you going to make me ignore you to force you to take a break?
[15:41:02] <taplar> i will dude
[15:41:10] <Sarelle> okey
[15:41:14] <Sarelle> you are right
[15:41:21] <Sarelle> thats enough i guess
[15:41:36] <Sarelle> forcing is not good
[15:41:58] <Sarelle> this is not real improvement
[15:42:12] <taplar> if you don't comprehend it or retain it, nope
[15:42:15] <Sarelle> i mean force myself to doÄ± stuff
[15:42:47] <Sarelle> guess you mean you should know when to quit or withdraw
[15:42:53] <Sarelle> righ
[15:42:53] <Sarelle> t
[15:43:22] <taplar> if you find yourself making mistakes you normally would not, or you do something and your not sure why you did it.  take a break
[15:43:26] <taplar> your not learning anything
[15:43:34] <taplar> just hitting keys
[15:44:12] <snowman44> totally agreeing with taplar ! had many situations where i got stuck really bad, took a break, maybe even let it go till the next day.. after the break, especially if i slept over it, it became pretty obvious, the solution i mean
[15:45:09] <Sarelle> i will listen two music
[15:45:12] <Sarelle> gotta sleep

[15:45:39] <taplar> not that i want to promote it in anyway, but a cig break can work too
[15:46:18] <Sarelle> cig break?
[15:46:26] <taplar> thought you were a smoker
[15:46:31] <Sarelle> man you use unknown things xD
[15:46:39] <Sarelle> ah cig
[15:47:05] <Sarelle> i dont smoke at home
[15:47:16] <Sarelle> anyway it is almost 11 p.m.
[15:47:27] <Sarelle> i need to wake up like 5:45 a.m.
[15:47:46] <snowman44> have a good night fella !
[15:47:54] <Sarelle> snowman44: you know
[15:48:05] <Sarelle> sometimes brain solves the problem automatically
[15:48:19] <Sarelle> you need to know let it go this is real case
[15:54:45] <taplar> wish it was 11 for me.  i got a 4 day weekend coming up, :D
[15:57:01] <Sarelle> 4 day weekend
[15:57:16] <Sarelle> so you will be two days off from job
[15:57:56] <taplar> yep
[15:58:30] <taplar> had a few vacation days i have to burn before the new fiscal year so I just scheduled a few mondays and fridays
[16:02:12] <Sarelle> fiscal means financial as far as i remember
[16:02:51] <taplar> yeah
[16:02:57] <taplar> i think
[16:03:00] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:03:05] <snowman44> :D
[16:04:23] <snowman44> hey taplar i am thinking of something i could learn next.. got my hands on JS and jQuery now. is jQuery something worth looking into ? or do frameworks do a better job at stuff like that? i was thinking of looking into electron, sounded kinda cool.
[16:04:44] <taplar> depends what your trying to do
[16:04:56] <taplar> frameworks and jQuery (which is just a library) serve different purposes
[16:05:15] <Sarelle> snowman44:i think you can use jquery in AngularJS
[16:05:19] <snowman44> yeah right jQuery is just a framework
[16:05:23] <snowman44> library*
[16:05:23] <snowman44> lol
[16:05:28] <Sarelle> jquery is library
[16:05:44] <taplar> yeah you can.  and angular has a small subset of jquery like methods included in it by default (jqlite)
[16:06:15] <snowman44> don't people use both in combination? or do they use either jquery or a framework like angular?
[16:06:26] <taplar> you can use just one or the other
[16:06:36] <snowman44> 2 big for both?
[16:06:49] <snowman44> or better said both 2 big lol
[16:06:54] <taplar> it's not a size issue really
[16:07:01] <taplar> though i guess depending on the device, maybe?
[16:07:22] <taplar> i'm not really a big front end developer to speak with confidence on this, but I feel it's a comfort thing
[16:07:32] <snowman44> hmm i see
[16:07:54] <taplar> duch_kazatel: could probably tell more
[16:08:06] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[16:08:18] <duch_kazatel> (i wasn't paying attention)
[16:08:37] <taplar> library vs framework, people chosing to use just one vs the other, or both together
[16:08:44] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[16:08:51] <duch_kazatel> really depends on which ones you're talking about.
[16:08:53] <taplar> specifically mentioned, jquery and angular
[16:09:34] <duch_kazatel> angular is a framework - it's more central to the development of your app.  you usually end up using it for everything from routing to state management to rendering, etc.
[16:09:53] <duch_kazatel> libraries (like jquery) aren't that central - you call out to them when you need them. got some dom manipulation to handle?  use jquery.
[16:10:18] <duch_kazatel> angular has its own jqlite subset dealio, but plenty of people use the two together since they play different roles.
[16:10:28] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[16:11:29] <snowman44> yeah it does, that is why i wondered why taplar said you wouldnt use both
[16:11:40] <duch_kazatel> you could.  lots of people do it either way.
[16:11:43] <snowman44> since i thought jquery is the get go guy when it comes to DOM stuff
[16:12:06] <taplar> taplar: you can use just one or the other
[16:12:08] <taplar> :P
[16:12:11] <duch_kazatel> ^
[16:12:14] <duch_kazatel> or both together.
[16:12:20] <snowman44> haha
[16:12:21] <duch_kazatel> kind of depends on your needs.
[16:12:27] <duch_kazatel> they fulfill different jobs though
[16:12:47] <snowman44> well the starting point was, what i could or should learn next. (i know you can never say should) - i got my hands on JS and jQuery now
[16:13:08] <duch_kazatel> build something using a framework.
[16:13:17] <duch_kazatel> backbone, angular, and react are all popular choices.
[16:13:24] <duch_kazatel> i like react, i really dislike angular.
[16:13:24] <Sarelle> you can write plain js or jquery in angular coding style right?
[16:13:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:13:40] <taplar> angular is js
[16:13:45] <duch_kazatel> jquery is js, too.
[16:13:46] <Sarelle> i mean in angular
[16:13:54] <duch_kazatel> erm.,
[16:14:04] <Sarelle> but you can use js functions while writing angular app
[16:14:15] <Sarelle> or just plain js methods
[16:14:18] <duch_kazatel> angular IS js.
[16:14:31] <duch_kazatel> you can't suddenly prevent people from using the language.
[16:14:36] <snowman44> :D
[16:15:06] <duch_kazatel> angylar provides a structure to build on.
[16:15:17] <snowman44> so, that was exactly what i was thinking - build something new (did a solitaire game while learning JS/jQuery) and well, the question was, which framework would be suggested, or what BIG difference is there between stuff like backbone angular or react?
[16:15:17] <duch_kazatel> *angular - it's not a very googd structure, but it's there.
[16:15:19] <taplar> it does the boiler plating for you
[16:16:38] <duch_kazatel> snowman44 the "should" is a loaded question.
[16:16:40] <Sarelle> angular does boiler plating
[16:16:46] <duch_kazatel> they all do it.
[16:16:50] <Sarelle> duch_kazatel: why you dont like angular
[16:17:06] <Sarelle> duch_kazatel: you mean reactJS right
[16:17:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:17:13] <duch_kazatel> i like react.
[16:17:55] <duch_kazatel> and I don't like typescript, i don't like angular's templating, and i don't like the way angular structures things.
[16:18:17] <snowman44> may i ask why? considering the fact i have no knowledge of angulars way of structuring
[16:18:27] <Sarelle> duch_kazatel: https://facebook.github.io/react/ ?
[16:18:34] <duch_kazatel> typescript tries to make javascript something it isn't snowman44
[16:18:47] <duch_kazatel> angular extends on that idea and makes it feel very "java-y"
[16:18:51] <duch_kazatel> Sarelle yep.
[16:18:59] <Sarelle> type script is ms thing i guess
[16:19:06] <duch_kazatel> *typescript, and yes.
[16:19:09] <duch_kazatel> i much prefer react's more functional approach.
[16:19:11] <Sarelle> java-y
[16:19:15] <duch_kazatel> flux is even better.
[16:19:17] <Sarelle> what does it mean?
[16:19:21] <duch_kazatel> Java-like
[16:19:21] <taplar> java like
[16:19:30] <snowman44> i see i see
[16:19:37] <Sarelle> es6 seems like java like
[16:19:39] <snowman44> flux is another framework, i assume?
[16:19:44] <duch_kazatel> not really, Sarelle
[16:19:56] <duch_kazatel> snowman44 yes.  also made by facebook, but you use it with react.
[16:20:01] <thinkxl> how do you fucking handle dropdowns on mobile view
[16:20:04] <Sarelle> https://facebook.github.io/flux/
[16:20:05] <thinkxl> ups, wrong channel
[16:20:12] <snowman44> uh flux sounds like the devils son haha
[16:20:37] <duch_kazatel> flux is how you handle data in your app.
[16:20:55] <duch_kazatel> thinkxl hahahaha
[16:20:58] <Sarelle> duch_kazatel:mvc thing?
[16:21:11] <duch_kazatel> Sarelle react is not MVC.  it's a fundamentally different approach.
[16:21:19] <thinkxl> duch_kazatel I know, I was lurking over your conversation about not liking angular
[16:21:21] <duch_kazatel> it comes close to the "v" layer.
[16:21:29] <duch_kazatel> thinkxl word
[16:21:47] <Sarelle> so first react then flux isit?
[16:21:59] <duch_kazatel> you use them together.
[16:22:07] <snowman44> So looking into react at my state of knowledge would be a good idea duch_kazatel?
[16:22:18] <Sarelle> but learn react
[16:22:19] <duch_kazatel> snowman44 i'ma blow your mind.
[16:22:22] <Sarelle> then to for flux
[16:22:24] <Sarelle> right
[16:22:32] <duch_kazatel> ignore everything I've said and just pick one and go for it.
[16:22:37] <Sarelle> go for*
[16:22:48] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter which one - you could use any of them.  vue is another popular one.
[16:22:54] <snowman44> haha
[16:23:00] <Sarelle> muha
[16:23:01] <snowman44> now if you keep this up you will really blow my mind
[16:23:04] <snowman44> as of now everything is fine
[16:23:07] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[16:23:15] <duch_kazatel> so just pick one and build things.
[16:23:15] <snowman44> functional approach sounds good as well
[16:23:22] <snowman44> -as well
[16:23:32] <snowman44> react it is, i like the logo
[16:23:40] <snowman44> fancy round thingies over a round thing
[16:23:51] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:23:54] <Sarelle> need to sleep
[16:24:03] <Sarelle> good night
[16:24:07] <snowman44> good night Sarelle!
[16:25:12] <snowman44> so do you always link to the facebook url when binding react.js?
[16:25:31] <duch_kazatel> jij
[16:25:33] <duch_kazatel> *huh?
[16:27:05] <snowman44> uhm, my english sucks when it comes to this kind of stuff. so the react getting started page pointed out putting the facebook links to react.js in your html file if you wanna use it. is that standard approach? i assumed you dl the .js and put the link to it on your webserver in the html.. if you get what i'm trying to say here
[16:27:17] <duch_kazatel> use a CDN.
[16:28:07] <duch_kazatel> https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react
[16:28:32] <snowman44> thanks
[16:28:38] <snowman44> is it faster than fb.me ?
[16:29:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:29:48] <snowman44> https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html - that page suggests fb.me
[16:29:53] <duch_kazatel> you could use those, too.
[16:30:08] <duch_kazatel> i thought you were just going to the page source and grabbing the url out of there or something.
[16:30:18] <duch_kazatel> and speed in cases like this are entirely irrelevant fwiw.
[16:31:28] <snowman44> thanks mate, you've been a great help!
[16:59:22] <taplar> that's interesting.  i may have to play around with some react
[17:00:35] <arc_> i don't want to talk shit about anybody, but i do have to commend your patience taplar
[17:00:57] <arc_> i feel like i have a lot more patience than most people but you are like a saint
[17:01:08] <snowman44> haha
[17:01:11] <taplar> i've said it before and i'll say it again.  it's possible that i just don't know better, ;)
[17:01:32] <arc_> someone who shall be named does not seem to have very much code sense, to say the least ...
[17:01:52] <arc_> i don't know if i could deal with that
[17:01:55] <taplar> just gotta keep poking until the "ah ha"
[17:04:29] <duch_kazatel> some people just need help to see the light.
[17:05:46] <taplar> which that can be a difficult thing anyway.  i mean, we have people who come into our training class here an my place and they can seem to grasp a language
[17:05:56] <taplar> but then when you start talking logic, it's like, a loss
[17:06:00] <taplar> hard to teach that
[17:06:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[17:07:11] <duch_kazatel> that's reall what separates developers.
[17:07:16] <duch_kazatel> *really
[17:07:37] <duch_kazatel> knowing a language is ultimately trivial - applying logic to solve problems is a whole different story.
[17:11:17] <arc_> when people ask me for help and it becomes obvious that they're basically just copying and pasting code from all kinds of places and hoping it will eventually work, i'm just like ... okay, i don't have time for this
[17:11:34] <taplar> heh, that's when you just start asking questions
[17:11:38] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:11:55] <taplar> they run into enough "uuuuuuh" moments, they'll realize where there at
[17:12:14] <duch_kazatel> or they get into entitlement mode and end up running themselves out.
[17:12:22] <arc_> heh
[17:17:47] <snowman44> duch_kazatel i know this is the jquery place, but i just got this quick question if you dont mind. so i hooked up this html with the react stuff (that is react.js and JSXTransformation.js) and also a script.js. when i write React.render(bunch of stuff); my console tells me that React.render is not a function. am i missing something here?
[17:18:08] <duch_kazatel> ask in #react :)
[17:18:15] <snowman44> legit answer!
[17:18:18] <snowman44> will do so
[17:18:55] <duch_kazatel> that may not be the right place fwiw.
[17:19:01] <duch_kazatel> might be #reactjs
[17:19:07] <snowman44> yeah its reactjs
[17:19:41] <snowman44> the packaging browserifying stuff and all that is pretty confusing ^^
[18:05:41] <taplar> c u guys next week
[18:05:45] * taplar frollicks away
[18:05:51] <taplar> whahahahaha
[18:48:12] <ABM_Dan> is there a way to make change() work as one would expect on radio buttons?
[18:49:59] <duch_kazatel> it should work "as one would expect".
[18:50:08] <ABM_Dan> Well, no.
[18:50:13] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:50:23] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting?
[18:50:27] <ABM_Dan> If it goes from checked to unchecked, I would expect it to signal it's been changed.
[18:50:38] <ABM_Dan> 'cause that's what the word change means.
[18:50:40] <duch_kazatel> it should do that.
[18:50:45] <ABM_Dan> It doesn't.
[18:50:51] <duch_kazatel> have a test case?
[18:52:32] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/m6b2vt6w/
[18:53:21] <duch_kazatel> oh, you mean that it's not recognizing that something is "unchecked"
[18:54:13] <duch_kazatel> i've never expected it to do that personally.  mostl people wouldn't i'd guess.
[18:54:28] <ABM_Dan> Why wouldn't they?
[18:54:43] <duch_kazatel> becuase why would you need to know if something is unchecked in a radio group?
[18:54:46] <duch_kazatel> you care about the thing that was checked.
[18:54:52] <ABM_Dan> if you get a cake your cake situation changed, if they take a cake from you, your cake situation changed.
[18:55:16] <ABM_Dan> I care about what I care about.\
[18:55:17] <duch_kazatel> right, but you can only have one thing in a radio group selected.
[18:55:30] <cangelosx> ABM_Dan: yes, but what changed was the value that was selected, not the specific item
[18:55:43] <duch_kazatel> it's exclusive - by virtue of choosing one, you've deselected the other.
[18:55:54] <cangelosx> it's just like a drop down except it's visually laid out
[18:55:59] <duch_kazatel> right.
[18:56:00] <ABM_Dan> cangelosx: the value of the item I am looking at changed, I'd expect it to be honest about it.
[18:56:04] <duch_kazatel> it is.
[18:56:11] <duch_kazatel> the radio GROUP has changed.
[18:56:23] <duch_kazatel> it's just like a dropdown as cangelosx
[18:56:28] <duch_kazatel> *pointed out
[18:56:32] <ABM_Dan> It's not like a drop down, as a drop down is one tags containing other tags, radio buttons are several tags tied by something else.
[18:56:36] <cangelosx> ABM_Dan: if there's a UX need to catch the item itself, you can always listen to a click maybe?
[18:56:55] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan but it's an exclusive selection.
[18:57:03] <duch_kazatel> by virtue of having selected on, you've deselected all others.
[18:57:15] <ABM_Dan> ok.
[18:57:19] * ABM_Dan breathes
[18:57:25] <ABM_Dan> It doesn't have any relevance.
[18:57:32] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:57:36] <duch_kazatel> that's completely relevant.
[18:57:58] <ABM_Dan> Let's say I have a radio selection, that says: cookies, cake, custom.
[18:58:03] <duch_kazatel> right.
[18:58:19] <ABM_Dan> if I select cookies, there is a dropdown that lets me pick a cookie that becomes enabled
[18:58:29] <ABM_Dan> when I select something else, it becomes disabled.
[18:58:49] <ABM_Dan> If it was a checkbox, it would work easily.
[18:59:04] <duch_kazatel> it still works easily.  a few different ways to handle that, in fact.
[18:59:07] <ABM_Dan> I listen on change, check the clicked status, tada.
[18:59:08] <cangelosx> right, so when radio group value changes, you look at the value to see if it's for a cookie, and adjust your dropdown accordingly
[18:59:19] <ABM_Dan> The radio group is not a thing.
[18:59:32] <ABM_Dan> There is no element known as radio group.
[18:59:39] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[18:59:43] <duch_kazatel> they all share a name.
[18:59:50] <ABM_Dan> There are input[type=radio] that share a name.
[18:59:53] <duch_kazatel> that what we mean.
[19:00:01] <duch_kazatel> *that's
[19:00:15] <ABM_Dan> yeah but the implementation is not as structured as, say, a select.
[19:00:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:00:23] <duch_kazatel> uh
[19:00:25] <cangelosx> are you trying to use a radio group as a checkbox basically?
[19:00:26] <duch_kazatel> you're convoluting this.
[19:00:39] <cangelosx> instead of yes or no, it would be cookie or cake?
[19:00:42] <ABM_Dan> so I would expect a radio button to fire just as a checkbox would, since it's basically the same thing, except for the mutual exclusiveness.
[19:00:45] <cangelosx> or something like that?
[19:00:49] <duch_kazatel> it's NOT the same thing.
[19:00:52] <duch_kazatel> that's where you're confused.
[19:01:06] <ABM_Dan> From a widget point of view, it pretty much is.
[19:01:16] <duch_kazatel> from an html and javascript point of view, it's not.
[19:01:23] <ABM_Dan> As a matter of fact, implementing radios with checkboxes is rather trivial.
[19:01:31] <duch_kazatel> but you'd never do that.
[19:01:38] <cangelosx> each checkbox has its own binary value, yes and no. a radio button is one option out of many, which is pretty much like a select
[19:02:01] <ABM_Dan> cangelosx: except radios ALSO have that binary value.
[19:02:09] <arc_> is this a philosophical debate or a question about how this actually needs to be implemented
[19:02:18] <ABM_Dan> the second.
[19:02:36] <duch_kazatel> then ask how to implement it instead of arguing :)
[19:02:53] <cangelosx> ABM_Dan: you need to give the radio buttons as value, then read the value and treat it like a checkbox
[19:03:03] <cangelosx> if im understanding your requirement
[19:03:11] <ABM_Dan> you didn't.
[19:03:26] <ABM_Dan> I want an event to fire when a radio gets unchecked.
[19:03:30] <duch_kazatel> you cannot have that.
[19:03:33] <ABM_Dan> That's all I ask of life.
[19:03:35] <duch_kazatel> without manually wiring it.
[19:03:38] <duch_kazatel> but that's really unusual.
[19:03:45] <ABM_Dan> It's really not.
[19:03:50] <duch_kazatel> it really is though.
[19:03:59] <snowman44> haha
[19:04:00] <ABM_Dan> stackoverflow disagrees.
[19:04:01] <snowman44> this debate tho
[19:04:08] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[19:04:27] <cangelosx> ABM_Dan: can you tell us more about your actual use case
[19:04:33] <ABM_Dan> duch_kazatel: I acknowledge your point, I disagree, let's not spend more time on it
[19:05:20] <arc_> i hate to ask this in the middle of the conversation, but why is that better than having something happen when a radio button is selected, which checks to see if the other radio buttons are not selected, and does whatever it needs to do from there
[19:05:30] <ABM_Dan> cangelosx: I have this radio. I want to figure out an elegant way to have an event fire when it's unchecked. I am likely going to have to place events on its buddies, but I was wondering if there was a nicely packed plugin or a weird event I could use.
[19:05:31] <duch_kazatel> becuase he thinks that doesn't make sense.
[19:06:02] <arc_> well i'm asking why that doesn't fit his specificaiton
[19:06:04] <cangelosx> ABM_Dan: listen for clicks, check value and if unchecked, trigger the change event
[19:06:11] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible hack.
[19:06:20] <duch_kazatel> and fwiw jquery simply follows the native DOM api in that case.
[19:06:42] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: how come?
[19:07:02] <ABM_Dan> the radio has a value like data-disable containing a list of things to be disabled
[19:07:17] <ABM_Dan> when I click on it, those things get disabled
[19:07:19] <duch_kazatel> that's why.
[19:07:24] <duch_kazatel> you need to not handle it that way.
[19:07:45] <duch_kazatel> store that information in an object elsehwere and have there value of each one be what gets "activated" - everything else gets "deactivated"
[19:07:47] <ABM_Dan> when I deselect it, I'd like for them to be reenabled.
[19:07:48] <cangelosx> i agree with you duch_kazatel, but if someone really wants to know when a radio button is unchecked, how else would you do it?
[19:07:56] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't.
[19:08:01] <duch_kazatel> that's my entire point.
[19:08:04] <cangelosx> ...we get that
[19:08:21] <cangelosx> I'm asking hypothetically, how would it be done?
[19:08:30] <duch_kazatel> lol
[19:08:40] <duch_kazatel> fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/aq9j7qtn/3/
[19:08:48] <duch_kazatel> and you'd have a really covoluted click event listener.
[19:09:00] <ABM_Dan> whatever, gonna write a small plugin that implements things in a way that makes sense.
[19:09:09] <duch_kazatel> enjoy!
[19:09:13] <ABM_Dan> 'cause when you call an event change, you fire it when stuff changes both ways.
[19:09:43] <duch_kazatel> take it up with the browser vendors and the W3/WHATWG then :)
[19:10:19] <arc_> isn't it easier to just disable everything and then enable the ones that apply for the one that got selected
[19:10:27] <arc_> it would happen instantly
[19:10:28] <ABM_Dan> Yeah, because that's a reasonable bunch.
[19:10:33] <ABM_Dan> I heard Hixie was sane once.
[19:10:33] <duch_kazatel> it is to me.
[19:10:35] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: you are entitled to your agreeably correct opinion on how things *should* be done in a general sense, but I think you confuse that a little too much with how a specific problem can be solved
[19:11:05] <duch_kazatel> i'd rather fix the problem, not a symptom.
[19:11:17] <duch_kazatel> i avoid the hack solutions because they wind up creating more issues down the road.
[19:11:24] <duch_kazatel> there's a time and a place - i feel that this isn't one of the,.
[19:11:26] <duch_kazatel> *them.
[19:11:40] <arc_> this isn't already so deep down the rabbit hole that it would take too much work to do it another way
[19:11:45] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[19:11:51] <cangelosx> It'd be like "Hey, how can I use jquery to write files to the local filesystem?" and you're like "DON'T."
[19:12:01] <duch_kazatel> Actually, you can't.
[19:12:10] <ABM_Dan> Actually you can. :)\
[19:12:16] <ABM_Dan> You just need a proxy.
[19:12:21] <duch_kazatel> and a server do handle that.
[19:12:38] <duch_kazatel> so jquery isn't writing files.  that's not the same thing whatsoever.
[19:12:39] <ABM_Dan> Sure.
[19:12:40] <cangelosx> The main point is that the question was "how do you do it", not "should I do it?"
[19:12:46] <ABM_Dan> It
[19:12:53] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx and our job is to help people understand that there's a better way.
[19:13:00] <ABM_Dan> Jquery doesn't write files.
[19:13:06] <duch_kazatel> *jQuery ;)
[19:13:08] <ABM_Dan> jquery is a bunch of code, it does nothing.
[19:13:24] <duch_kazatel> if you want to be excessively pedantic, sure.
[19:13:30] <ABM_Dan> until you plug it in a webpage inside of a browser etc.
[19:13:44] <ABM_Dan> I wasn't the one going "but jquery isn't writing the files".
[19:14:01] <duch_kazatel> my point was that the comparison isn't a fair one :)
[19:14:02] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: sure, but it's easy to take a little too far, y'know?
[19:14:09] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx not imo.
[19:14:24] <duch_kazatel> if y'all have an issue with me, i welcome you to PM me about it, but I'd rather not derail the channel any more over it.  Thanks!
[19:14:57] <amikrop> var x = $('.nonexistent000') || $('html');  // returns [] , why?
[19:15:11] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[19:15:17] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: was it you that was telling me "Your client's merchant needs to make an API" in response to "How do you use jquery to simulate typing in a text box"?
[19:15:39] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx i don't recall.  maybe?
[19:15:54] <ABM_Dan> >_<
[19:16:34] <duch_kazatel> amikrop could you clarify your question?
[19:16:41] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I think it was, but that's a very good example of not answering the question
[19:16:58] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: not holding it against you; just an example is all
[19:16:59] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx great! if you'd like you have a discussion about that, feel free to PM me.  thanks!
[19:16:59] <DakshShah> not able to fetch an element using js, it says cannot read property of null. Code: null https://github.com/Daksh/musicblocks/commit/e9b54975fb10a8b40a95bfc52e2b6cf2892844a3#diff-c9771817b0b1e7ef2e9185f91a62b4cfR2527
[19:17:14] <duch_kazatel> amikrop ah, i see now - you're getting back empty jquery objects.
[19:17:18] <duch_kazatel> objects are truthy in js.
[19:17:26] <amikrop> oh I see
[19:17:30] <duch_kazatel> so you could to $() - it's still truthy.
[19:17:38] <amikrop> what would be the best way to do that? the ?: operator?
[19:17:47] <duch_kazatel> amikrop yep.
[19:18:01] <amikrop> ok thanks
[19:18:06] <duch_kazatel> DakshShah any other console errors?
[19:18:29] <DakshShah> duch_kazatel, Yes console error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fadeToggle' of null"
[19:18:45] <duch_kazatel> that means you're missing jquery.
[19:18:59] <duch_kazatel> or it's getting reset somewhere.
[19:19:24] <duch_kazatel> make sure you've loaded jquery before everything else.
[19:19:28] <DakshShah> duch_kazatel, but jquery is present afaik
[19:19:37] <duch_kazatel> DakshShah is it loaded before your other code?
[19:19:44] <DakshShah> duch_kazatel, I load that in a html, in which jquery gets loaded before
[19:20:06] <duch_kazatel> go to your console and type $.fn.jquery - what do you get?
[19:20:51] <DakshShah> duch_kazatel, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined(â€¦)
[19:21:06] <duch_kazatel> there's your problem.  you're not successfully loading jquery.
[19:21:12] <ABM_Dan> This has seen circa 0 testing, but I guess it might work. https://gist.github.com/ABM-Dan/1bd41c3003996bca066f
[19:21:28] <DakshShah> duch_kazatel, how to load it then? in the js file itself?
[19:22:17] <ABM_Dan> Hm.
[19:22:26] <ABM_Dan> This fires even if the value didn't really change.
[19:22:35] <duch_kazatel> DakshShah before your js file.
[19:22:35] <ABM_Dan> I might want to fix that. Or not.
[19:44:29] <duch_kazatel> Glad you found a solution, ABM_Dan
[19:44:37] <ABM_Dan> Haven't yet.
[19:44:43] <ABM_Dan> tinkering hard.
[19:45:19] <duch_kazatel> just out of curiousity, why not implement this differently to work with the event system, instead of around it?
[19:45:48] <ABM_Dan> You mean tying the re-enabling on the other radios?
[19:45:53] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[19:46:01] <duch_kazatel> err,sorry misread that.
[19:46:14] <duch_kazatel> i mean recognizing which one is now "active" and deactivating others that don't match that one.
[19:46:30] <ABM_Dan> ... what?
[19:46:46] <duch_kazatel> :) let me try to make a fiddle.
[19:46:48] <ABM_Dan> var targetList = el.attr('data-disable').replace(/([^,]*)(,|$)/g, '[name$=\'[$1]\']$2');
[19:47:17] <duch_kazatel> for what it's worth, you should probably opt for .data() instead of .attr('data-*');
[19:47:17] <ABM_Dan> and then I go either $(targetList).lock(); or $(targetList).unlock();
[19:47:35] <duch_kazatel> and i'd suggest pulling that data into an object and using the value of the radios get grab relevant info instead.
[19:47:58] <ABM_Dan> wait what?
[19:48:19] <amikrop> How can I put some text with linebreaks into a textarea?
[19:48:42] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan i assume you're putting a list of element names to "enable" inside of a data attribute?
[19:48:47] <ABM_Dan> amikrop, tried using \n ?
[19:48:59] <amikrop> I have some html (with <br />) as a string, and I want to put it as text in a <textarea>, how can I turn the <br /> to actual linebreaks?
[19:49:02] <ABM_Dan> not strictly names.
[19:49:09] <amikrop> ABM_Dan: ok i will
[19:49:12] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan but selectors for other elements?
[19:49:24] <ABM_Dan> amikrop, string replace?
[19:49:35] <amikrop> yep
[19:50:00] <ABM_Dan> [name$=[thething]], [name$=[theotherthing]]
[19:50:30] <duch_kazatel> so selectors?
[19:50:39] <ABM_Dan> sure
[19:50:45] <duch_kazatel> what would you call them?
[19:50:50] <ABM_Dan> I thought you mean ids.
[19:50:50] <duch_kazatel> what are you using them for?
[19:50:53] <ABM_Dan> getting tired.
[19:51:03] <ABM_Dan> those are the form elements I disable.
[19:51:10] <duch_kazatel> yeah, so those would be selectors.
[19:51:33] <ABM_Dan> yeah el is the radio button.
[19:52:04] <duch_kazatel> right.  so there's a different way to manage that, which is that you put that information into an object and then use the keys of the radios to get the things you're looking for.
[19:52:25] <ABM_Dan> Assume for a moment, that I had no access to the html.
[19:52:33] <ABM_Dan> I can only work on js to fix this.
[19:52:46] <ABM_Dan> And it's not an impossible (or even wrongly planned) task.
[19:54:26] <duch_kazatel> that's interesting.
[19:54:41] <duch_kazatel> wonder why they won't let you fix the markup.
[19:55:04] <ABM_Dan> Because it's not broken.
[19:55:28] <duch_kazatel> It'd make some things much simpler if you could change it.
[19:55:43] <ABM_Dan> Not necessarily.
[19:56:14] <duch_kazatel> Sure.  it'd make your state management a easier to handle imo.  You can disagree, just curious :)
[19:56:37] <ABM_Dan> The thing is, this is not on one page.
[19:56:42] <ABM_Dan> This happens everywhere.
[19:56:52] <duch_kazatel> sure.  that doesn't really change my suggestions.
[19:57:13] <ABM_Dan> Nor your suggestions change the predicament.
[19:57:26] <paulong> Hi if someone could help me!
[19:57:47] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan i'm just curious.  I'm trying to help you do this an easier way.
[19:58:13] <ABM_Dan> The thing is, this is not hard.
[19:58:17] <duch_kazatel> paulong shoot out your question :)
[19:58:22] <ABM_Dan> It's just a kind of easy I am not educated in.
[19:58:34] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan So then why would you argue with me so much over it?
[19:58:58] <ABM_Dan> ... you were making points, I was making counterpoints.
[19:59:23] <duch_kazatel> And refuting things :)
[19:59:24] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[19:59:38] <paulong> i'm working in app. I'm using jquery mobile, dreamweavercs6 and appserver but i cant make it work http://imgur.com/8wtff99
[19:59:44] <ABM_Dan> yeah, I disagreed, and I said so, I don't know how communication works otherwise?
[20:00:02] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan I assume you'd like to learn how to make this easier on yourself though, right?
[20:00:14] <paulong> I've been using wamps with the same result
[20:00:23] <ABM_Dan> look, in pseudocode I can write it in seconds.
[20:00:38] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan sure, based off an assumption about how a particular event works.
[20:00:51] <ABM_Dan> Nono, I'm talking about the workaround.
[20:01:37] <duch_kazatel> Sure, and I'm saying that you don't need the workaround.  But feel free to pursue that.  I'd like to see what you come up with!
[20:02:10] <duch_kazatel> paulong that's... hard for us to help with.  looks like maybe the links to load jquery mobile aren't pointing to the right places?
[20:02:26] <ABM_Dan> cache the current checked value of the source radio, set a change callback on all radios of the same name, when one of them fires, check if the cached value changed, if it did, run the callable from the scope of the source radio.
[20:02:40] <ABM_Dan> not callback
[20:02:41] <ABM_Dan> listener.
[20:02:47] <ABM_Dan> set a change listener.
[20:02:51] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan the listener's callback, yeah.
[20:03:25] <ABM_Dan> So, that's it. I have no clue how to implement it, but that's the concept.
[20:03:26] <duch_kazatel> i know what you're trying to do.
[20:09:23] <paulong> ABM_Dan, duch_kazatel, you are talking about me?
[20:09:38] <duch_kazatel> paulong nope, but i did provide a suggestion.
[20:09:41] <ABM_Dan> paulong: no man, don't worry :)
[20:10:14] <duch_kazatel> shit I have a band thing to run to.  good luck folks.
[20:10:23] <paulong> c ya
[20:15:10] <taplar> i leave and drame ensues, dang
[20:15:14] <taplar> *drama
[20:16:28] <ABM_Dan> https://jsbin.com/kuwoyuxipe/edit?html,js,console,output
[20:16:30] <ABM_Dan> There you go.
[20:16:35] <ABM_Dan> Got my fixed version.
[20:18:42] <ABM_Dan> This is so much better. And so darn elegant.
[20:18:53] <ABM_Dan> I mean not the plugin, that's messy.
[20:19:17] <ABM_Dan> But the implementation works like a charm, with a bit of dirty caused by the .data thing
[20:20:20] <paulong> ABM_Dan, dud what is that page?
[20:20:44] <ABM_Dan> paulong: fix for an issue I was having.
[20:22:12] <paulong> cool
[20:22:32] <paulong> i was talking about jsbin in general xD
[20:22:53] <ABM_Dan> It's a debug pastebin. Like jsfiddle.
[20:25:32] <paulong> I'm new on this to programming I just know html. css jquery mobile i'm learning php but its hard!
[20:27:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cmm2y6vf/ ?
[20:35:43] <ABM_Dan> taplar, I needed something generic.
[20:36:35] <ABM_Dan> the objective was not to have that advertised, it was to have a jquery event listener that worked for radios like change works for checkboxes.
[20:36:43] <ABM_Dan> uh
[20:37:00] <ABM_Dan> that was almost english.
[20:37:03] <ABM_Dan> Tired, sorry.
[20:45:26] <user_corrupt> I have the following function animating a couple of meters for 5 seconds: https://jsfiddle.net/user_corrupt/76eqhphw/17/ After 2 seconds, I call the same function with different values. The animation responds 3 seconds later by adjusting itself to the new values. What I would really like to do is remove the original animation after 2 seconds, and then start a new one from scratch. Any advice?
[20:46:41] <taplar> lol, what's up with the document ready in the function?
[20:47:08] <taplar> your doing lookups before it...
[20:49:18] <taplar> and your redefining that function every time meter runs
[20:53:10] <user_corrupt> teplar: oh yeah, that is some code that I forgot in there.. I had been trying to change the values in the animation mid-animation.. now I just want to reload it from scratch..
[20:53:16] <user_corrupt> taplar:
[20:53:35] <user_corrupt> https://jsfiddle.net/user_corrupt/76eqhphw/18/
[20:54:52] <taplar> ok, so i believe that animate returns a promise
[20:55:08] <taplar> in which case you should be able to do resolve() on it to force it to complete
[20:55:53] <taplar> or you may have to do .promise() off of it to get access to it
[20:57:34] <user_corrupt> hmm, I should research what a "promise" is exactly
[20:57:48] <taplar> do you understand the concept of a deferred?
[20:57:52] <user_corrupt> nope
[20:57:54] <taplar> ok
[20:58:16] <taplar> so, think about things such as ajax calls, where the process becomes asynchronous
[20:58:30] <taplar> animation is kinda like that.  it's running the logic to do your animate while other logic is still processing
[20:58:42] <taplar> but you have to have a way to know when it's done
[20:58:59] <taplar> a deferred, or promise, is an object that facilitates that
[20:59:31] <taplar> functions such as done() when put on a deferred/promise tell it, hey, when your done, when ever that may be, do this
[20:59:50] <user_corrupt> oh, I see
[20:59:54] <taplar> resolve() on the other hand, says, i don't care if your finished yet, finish now!
[21:00:02] <user_corrupt> ah
[21:03:41] <taplar> ah, it's actually finish()
[21:04:13] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[21:04:25] <Starcraftmazter> im trying to do a GET request in jquery, but firefox complains about a CORS
[21:04:45] <Starcraftmazter> im a bit confused though, why would this be applicable to a GET request, or any request? isnt it the same as going to that url in a browser?
[21:04:55] <Starcraftmazter> its not being loaded in an image or iframe or anything
[21:05:53] <taplar> user_corrupt, https://jsfiddle.net/76eqhphw/19/
[21:06:25] <shoky> Starcraftmazter: it's not the same as going to the url in the browser, because that's an action you decide to do yourself. while js code doing an ajax request is not you deciding to do that yourself
[21:07:09] <shoky> anyways you need the server to support CORS ;p
[21:07:20] <shoky> for a cross-domain request
[21:09:45] <Starcraftmazter> shoky: if the server does support it, is there anything the client needs to do ?
[21:11:04] <shoky> Starcraftmazter: the browser needs to do stuff, but it does that for you transparently, assuming cors is configured fine
[21:11:16] <shoky> (configured on server i mean)
[21:12:35] <Starcraftmazter> yeh i mean ar ethere any special parameters i need to set for the request, or any headers
[21:12:45] <shoky> nope
[23:31:20] <AlwaysHigh> hey guys
[23:31:25] <AlwaysHigh> ive been trying for so long
[23:31:59] <AlwaysHigh> to change select option to remove selected="selected" and move to the newest option selected
[23:32:19] <AlwaysHigh> i can get it to change but when i do that it wont change the text shown in the default view
