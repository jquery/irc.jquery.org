[00:00:16] <ServerSage> Aaah, so jQuery('#divid').trim()?
[00:00:28] <ServerSage> Oops, jQuery('#divid').html().trim()
[00:00:34] <aagii> try
[00:01:33] <jphase> ServerSage: yeah that's right
[00:01:45] <ServerSage> jphase: Thanks.
[00:01:56] <ServerSage> aagii: Thanks as well.
[00:02:13] <aagii> jphase: please check my code
[00:02:16] <aagii> http://jsfiddle.net/T5V2u/1/
[00:03:06] <Cork> uh
[00:03:22] <Cork> no jquery trim is $.trim() or jQuery.trim()
[00:03:28] <Cork> not string.trim()
[00:03:53] <Cork> ServerSage, aagii, jphase: ^
[00:04:05] <jphase> oh my bad
[00:04:11] <jphase> I knew that, it's late :(
[00:04:38] <jphase> also breaks in ie to use .trim method right?
[00:04:44] <ServerSage> Oh, ok.  So it would be jQuery.trim(jQuery('#divid').html())
[00:04:49] <jphase> yeah
[00:04:49] <Cork> ServerSage: yes
[00:05:13] <Cork> string.trim works in ie9+
[00:05:23] <jphase> ah, yeah that's it
[00:05:27] <jphase> :x
[00:06:51] <jphase> aagii: the "table" portion of your selector will make that not fire in your particular syntax
[00:07:29] <jphase> aagii: $('.my_grid tr').on('mouseover', '.datarow'   might be what you're looking for, or perhaps just $('.my_grid tr.datarow').on('mouseover'
[00:07:41] <aagii> these js code working another place, but not working here
[00:08:13] <Cork> no most likely he wants to remove tr from the first selector
[00:08:27] <Cork> as datarow is a tr element
[00:08:55] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/T5V2u/2/
[00:09:07] <Cork> opps same change on line 5
[00:10:13] <aagii> cork: it is still not working
[00:10:35] <jphase> heh, k
[00:11:57] <aagii> i can't find any error
[00:12:35] <jphase> mine works as well, but w/e
[00:13:16] <Cork> wait a min mouseover on a tr
[00:13:20] <Cork> that will be tricky
[00:13:36] <Cork> as you will get mouseout as soon as you move from tr to td
[00:13:43] <Cork> and that would be like a ring of 1px
[00:13:50] <aagii> these table is loaded dynamically
[00:15:05] <Cork> aagii: http://jsfiddle.net/T5V2u/4/
[00:17:36] <aagii> cork: it's working on fiddle, but not working on my dynamic table
[00:17:53] <Cork> aagii: is my_grid also dynamic?
[00:18:17] <aagii> yes
[00:18:31] <Cork> well then your selector is totally broken
[00:18:42] <aagii> these double tables are loaded dynamically in a div
[00:18:46] <Cork> you need to have a parent to delegate to, if you don't you can't add any event listeners to it
[00:19:03] <Cork> then point the selector at that div
[00:20:04] <aagii> is it possible to define where the selector pointer confused
[00:20:39] <aagii> cork: and any find tools to find selector broken
[00:21:05] <Cork> aagii: $() should be a parent that is always around
[00:21:24] <Cork> then on(event, selector) should be to the element from that parent
[00:21:35] <aagii> yes
[00:43:07] <zquad> is it a good idea to store element data in data-* tags?
[00:43:33] <zquad> is it a good idea to store element data in data-* tags?  I see that many people are still putting embedded data in rel tags
[00:48:27] <Cork> zquad: data- is the only place you should ever put such data
[00:48:56] <Cork> as that is the only place you are (by spec) guaranteed to never get problems with future specs
[00:49:35] <zquad> right but now im wondering if by doing very old browers, that does not supports html5, will break...??
[00:50:02] <zquad> is it safe for very old browsers?
[00:50:08] <Cork> zquad: they only thing new in the spec here is that it is specked
[00:50:27] <Cork> you can go back to mid 90's and all browsers still supported data- attributes
[00:50:42] <zquad> really... ok thanks
[00:50:50] <Cork> the spec has reserved the data-* namespace so future specks won't ever do anything in there
[00:50:59] <Cork> that is all
[00:51:19] <zquad> awesome thanks
[00:52:12] <Cork> zquad: btw when you want to talk about things like this refer to the feature instead, html5 doesn't mean anything
[00:52:31] <Cork> (or it means every thing you can do on the net; depening on how you look at it)
[00:52:50] <zquad> no worries
[01:04:49] <grafi> mmmmmmmh speck
[02:02:00] <juanlas> anyone know any good plugins for drawing paginable tables that sync with the server?
[02:02:45] <Cork> juanlas: should be a fairly quite google to find it
[02:02:53] <Cork> ?g jquery table pagination
[02:02:53] <b-ot> Cork: Is it possible to Paginate a table using jquery? - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2974246/
[02:03:02] <juanlas> datatables is neat, but their server interaction consists of custom server-side code which I'd like to avoid
[02:03:37] <Cork> juanlas: well for pagination you will always have to have some form of special server code for it
[02:03:47] <Cork> as you have to be able to request more content
[02:04:32] <juanlas> I was wondering if there was a plugin that had maybe hooks I can write to interact with my server response, instead of enforcing a specific protocol
[02:04:46] <juanlas> that'd be cleaner I think
[02:17:52] <Cork> juanlas: well normally there shouldn't be any need for a specific protocol
[02:18:09] <Cork> but it will need an url it can send from where to where it needs to get data
[02:18:37] <Cork> though pagination is normally simplest to implement server side
[02:22:20] <juanlas> for example, datatables creates a very specific response: http://datatables.net/development/server-side/php_mongodb
[02:22:38] <juanlas> I just want to use a generic ReSTful response that is already implemented on my site
[02:22:59] <Cork> and what would get the next set of data?
[02:23:48] <juanlas> well, that's why I mentioned hooks before, the idea is there would be a generic table plugin where the user would write his own code to interact with his specific server response
[02:24:15] <juanlas> in my case, my response has a 'links' property that can be used to fetch the next or previous set of data
[02:24:44] <Cork> juanlas: simplest is most likely to do it by hand and just request the next set
[02:25:19] <Cork> it isn't hard writing pagination as soon as you can expose the data needed (number of records/pages and request specific set of data)
[02:25:52] <juanlas> the only annoying part for me is the stupid pagination buttons and styling which I really don't want to write
[02:26:05] <juanlas> I'm waaay too lazy for that
[02:26:10] <Cork> ...
[02:26:14] <Cork> so download a theme
[02:27:35] <juanlas> i might try to hack datatables to do my bidding
[02:29:58] <garrilla> suerly hacking a plugin will take waaay more work than stupid pagination buttons ? ;)
[02:31:18] <juanlas> yes but it is an endeavor of a higher level
[02:31:38] <Cork> O_o'
[02:32:08] <Cork> so you prefer to over complicate your site, rather then just designing an element?
[02:32:13] <juanlas> plus, if the hack works I might be able to reuse it on another project
[02:33:00] <mikecmpbll> lol
[02:37:38] <juanlas> well, I may have gotten ahead of myself, datatables has a hook for adapting server side data
[02:51:50] <zquad> Cork you awake?
[02:51:57] <Cork> sure
[02:52:00] <zquad> :)
[02:52:11] <Cork> i usually don't sleep at 10:52 am :)
[02:52:39] <zquad> oh right, you're from the wrong side of he planet :)
[02:53:35] <zquad> I created a modal window from jquerytools overlays with buttons yes and no, what would be the best way to return the response of the modal?  Have global variable and listen for a change in its value?
[02:53:58] <zquad> the modal is invoked using modal( {title, body, options } )
[02:54:09] <Cork> zquad: i suspect it has callbacks or something like that
[02:54:43] <Cork> zquad: also you can't return values you would have to react of either a callback from the modal or an event from the button if there is no events for the modal
[02:54:56] <Cork> *react on
[02:56:37] <zquad> right so I will need a callback .click() for the group of buttons and perform an action depending on which is clicked
[03:04:51] <krambiorix> hi guys, my scroll button doesn't work... I thnk it has to do with the position:fixed on the header div... Can someone take a look at it? http://jsfiddle.net/882hP/
[03:08:39] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to scroll the window not the page container
[03:08:45] <Cork> as the container doesn't have any scroll
[03:10:04] <krambiorix> Cork, hmmm that's not the solution: http://jsfiddle.net/882hP/1/
[03:10:07] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/882hP/2/
[03:19:32] <krambiorix> Cork, that's great!!!!
[03:19:36] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot
[03:19:39] <Cork> np
[03:19:45] <krambiorix> Cork, any idea why my solution didn't work?
[03:20:07] <Cork> krambiorix: there is no element with the name "window"
[03:20:15] <Cork> also you don't have any click event handler
[03:21:56] <krambiorix> ooow ok
[03:22:02] <krambiorix> Cork,  well thanks again
[03:26:44] <PeterB> Is it possible to fade out one element and fade in another (in the same place) without using absolute positioning?
[03:28:04] <PeterB> As in my responsive design, having to set a fixed height on the container (to fake abs posn stuff being in the page flow) messes up the responsiveness
[03:36:14] <cusco> hi folks
[03:36:49] <cusco> I have a selector: $('input, select, textarea')
[03:37:13] <cusco> but now I would like to select all of these, where they hav no class 'customClass'
[03:37:21] <cusco> how can I do that?
[03:38:00] <garrilla> $('input, select, textarea').not('.customeClass')
[03:38:02] <cusco> found :not() it seems
[03:38:04] <cusco> err
[03:38:15] <cusco> .not() chained?
[03:38:20] <cusco> or :not inside the selector?
[03:39:47] <cusco> $('input:not(.customClass), select:not(.customClass), textarea:not(customClass)')
[03:39:50] <cusco> $('input:not(.customClass), select:not(.customClass), textarea:not(.customClass)')
[03:40:05] <cusco> should be more cost effective ...
[03:41:59] <Narwhaal> why does $('body').innerWidth() return null ?
[03:44:40] <cusco> "This method is not applicable to window and document objects"
[03:44:52] <cusco> "for these, use .width() instead."
[03:46:10] <eigentor> How do I get to the scripts that are not inline in the Firebug Script Debugger to set breakpoints
[03:46:14] <eigentor> I can call the inline ones
[03:46:19] <Narwhaal> cusco, I changed it to .width() too
[03:46:25] <eigentor> but I cannot click on the ones that are not inline
[03:46:28] <Narwhaal> now it says body undefined
[03:47:08] <Narwhaal> nvm fixed that
[03:47:20] <Narwhaal> .width() still returning null

[04:20:01] <borgdrone7> hi
[04:20:42] <borgdrone7> can anyone explain this:
[04:20:43] <borgdrone7> data: { 					        what: "email", 					        fieldval: function() { 				            return $( "#usersemail" ).val(); 				          } 				        }
[04:20:55] <borgdrone7> why there needs to be function()
[04:21:02] <grafi> cant even read it
[04:21:13] <xec> what's the context
[04:21:21] <Narwhaal> easy to read grafi: use ircormat for hexchat
[04:21:24] <borgdrone7> why cant it simply be: fieldval: $( "#usersemail" ).val();
[04:21:26] <Narwhaal> ircformat *
[04:21:37] <grafi> no
[04:21:38] <grafi> :P
[04:21:44] <Narwhaal> :P
[04:26:45] <grafi> borgdrone7 does it work without the function?
[04:26:46] <grafi> ^^
[04:28:45] <borgdrone7> did not try
[04:28:58] <borgdrone7> but saw on numerous places same pattern
[04:29:14] <xec> what's the context?
[04:29:37] <grafi> in that case, just try it?
[04:29:41] <Cork> borgdrone7: that creates an object that ajax then will run $.params on
[04:29:46] <Cork> to generate a parame string
[04:30:06] <Cork> ah, the function; sorry
[04:30:22] <Cork> ya, that would throw
[04:41:58] <frank_o> Any jQuery Mobile party people in the house?
[04:43:03] <frank_o> This jQuery Mobile dropdown menu has automatic columns to ensure that it never flows out of the page vertically. But how come these columns stop working after switching to a subsequent page? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/gg6p5/2/
[04:45:21] <borgdrone7> so you think it could work without function?
[04:46:16] <Cork> borgdrone7: yes cause then you would be sending a value there instead of a function reference
[04:48:43] <vedic> How to develop a regular notification which fades out after a certain number of seconds? I want to show to the user that page has been updated after performing ajax operation
[04:54:02] <Cork> vedic: $('message')
[04:54:03] <Cork> opps
[04:54:36] <Cork> vedic: $('#message').html(new_message).show(0).delay(2000).hide(300);
[04:54:56] <Cork> of fadeIn/fadeOut if you prefer that
[04:55:00] <Cork> *or
[05:01:00] <frank_o> Cork: is there a way to hide() after delay() without having it animate?
[05:01:20] <frank_o> Cork: recently came across this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8610800/add-delay-before-hide-w-jquery and it seems like a horrible detour :D
[05:01:33] <muzik> Hi All. So i have made a draggable block of text, and i save the left and top coordinates when the user exists the screen. Is there a way to position the block of text in the last spot when the web page opens?
[05:01:45] <muzik> screen = web page
[05:03:10] <Cork> frank_o: setTimeout(function() {}, time);
[05:03:51] <Cork> frank_o: basically if you want to delay things you always have to use a timer
[05:04:08] <Cork> frank_o: the animate thing i showed was a hack to get jquery chain to use the timer
[05:05:36] <frank_o> Cork: cool
[05:13:46] <vedic> Cork: Thanks
[05:30:51] <StanAccy> I have a selector like:  $('.popup span.close').click( function(){...} );   Should this attach the click handler to all instances of the span.close element it finds on the page?
[05:31:23] <Cork> only if it has a parent with the class popup
[05:31:42] <StanAccy> yeh - so it should operate on multiple instances of that page structure
[05:32:11] <Cork> sure, as long as it exists when the selector runs
[05:32:28] <MalMen> hello, what is the best way to transform a number for exampel 9521 in 10000 or 11 in 100 for example, i want to round every number up
[05:32:46] <StanAccy> for some reason, one of my instances does not have the click handler bound to its span.close - all instances are generated from the same code.  Any suggestions on where to look as to the cause of the missing event handler?
[05:36:36] <Cork> MalMen: Math.round(9521 / Math.pow(10, 4)) * Math.pow(10, 4) possibly?
[05:37:10] <MalMen> Cork no
[05:37:19] <MalMen> the number can be for example 555
[05:37:34] <Cork> you will always have to specify the precision you want
[05:37:46] <MalMen> 555 to 1000 or 4444 to 10000 or 11111 to 100000
[05:38:09] <Cork> so num.toString().length
[05:38:55] <MalMen> hmmm
[05:39:33] <Cork> or actually
[05:40:16] <MalMen> can you show me ? sorry, i dont understund some of the functions yet
[05:41:45] <Cork> js> print(Math.pow(10, 9521.soString().length))
[05:41:51] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:42:26] <Cork> js> print(Math.pow(10, (9521).toString().length))
[05:42:29] <b-ot> Cork: 10000
[05:42:45] <Cork> MalMen: that is what you need
[05:45:22] <MalMen> Cork thank you very much :)
[05:45:39] <Cork> np
[05:45:59] <StanAccy> is there a way to debugging how many elements a jquery selector finds during the .bind() process ?
[05:46:26] <Cork> StanAccy: it doesn't do it during the bind process
[05:46:30] <Cork> it happens in $()
[05:46:42] <Cork> so just do console.log($(selector).length)
[05:46:46] <StanAccy> thats the document ready?
[05:46:54] <StanAccy> Cork: Thanks
[05:49:30] <StanAccy> ok, so its found both span.close during document.ready, but the onclick handler (or bind('click',....) only fires for 1 of the elements
[05:50:02] <Cork> StanAccy: code please
[05:50:06] <StanAccy> uysing the jquery inspector I dont see the onclick handler attached to the second one, only the first
[05:50:17] <StanAccy> Cork: Working on a cut down version - the page is large right now
[05:50:40] <Cork> just so you know i will be gone in ~30 mins
[05:50:47] <StanAccy> ok
[05:53:21] <StanAccy>  is there a way to hook in to the bind/unbind process - so I can view when an event handler is being bound and unbound?
[06:00:40] <Cork> StanAccy: it happens exactly when you call bind
[06:00:51] <Cork> StanAccy: there isn't any chance it losing an element
[06:01:05] <Cork> StanAccy: the cause is most likely:
[06:01:21] <Cork> 1. your selecting on ids and you have duplicate ones (invalid)
[06:01:35] <Cork> 2. you select and bind on elements, but then you replace them with ex. new html
[06:01:48] <Cork> 3. something is covering the element so the click doesn't get to it
[06:02:02] <Cork> or 4. something is stopping the event before your event listeners is fired
[06:02:10] <Cork> return false; in another event listener can cause this
[06:02:24] <StanAccy> 1. Not this - Im using classes.   2. No replacement going on.   3. Maybe this, but both popup divs are set to the same z-index   4.) maybe   - just grabbing a jquery trace script to help diagnose
[06:03:30] <garrilla> even with the same-z index one must still be higher up the heirarchy than the other, i think..
[06:04:25] <StanAccy> garrilla: I dont follow.  I have two divs, peers of each other, with the same class definitions and the same inner HTML ( at least the first portion - the header and a close link)
[06:04:39] <StanAccy> I made a simple test case on jsfiddle but that works as expected and I cant break it
[06:08:30] <Cork> StanAccy: a simple test to see if something is covering is to bind $(document).on('click', function(event) { console.log(event.target); });
[06:08:38] <Cork> the element it echos is the one you clicked
[06:08:48] <Cork> if it isn't a child or the element you want, then something is covering
[06:09:22] <StanAccy> Cork: Good idea, thanks
[06:12:08] <garrilla> would $('*').click(function(){console.log(this);}); tell you what you are clicking on
[06:12:36] <Cork> garrilla: it would do the same thing as the one i gave, but just MUCH slower
[06:12:50] <garrilla> ah, yes,
[06:13:16] <shoky> it would also bubble up to each eleent and trigger the click for all its ancestors
[06:13:24] <Cork> ugg...
[06:13:30] <Cork> ya i didn't even think of that >_>
[06:13:35] <shoky> ;p
[06:13:41] <Cork> would be a click event storm
[06:14:00] <StanAccy> jquery doesnt like function(e){ console.log( e.target ); }
[06:14:15] <shoky> how so
[06:14:20] <Cork> should work just fine
[06:14:31] <StanAccy> ˆm getting an exception every time it fires
[06:14:42] <Cork> what is the exception?
[06:14:59] <StanAccy> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: function (event) { console.log('click event, target: ' + event.target); }
[06:15:07] <Cork> heh ya
[06:15:13] <Cork> target is an element reference
[06:15:15] <Cork> not a string
[06:15:25] <StanAccy> I tried it without the string concat, same prob
[06:15:31] <Cork> console.log('click event, target', event.target)
[06:16:52] <shoky> unrecognized expression? methinks something else is going on
[06:17:12] <shoky> StanAccy: where did you stick that function
[06:17:14] <StanAccy> where do I put the document.on() call? inside the document.ready or outside?
[06:17:30] <Cork> either should work
[06:17:32] <shoky> inside, tho doesn't matter very much
[06:17:36] <Cork> document is always around
[06:26:56] <StanAccy> I see the click event being printed, but the real event handler isnt being fierd
[06:28:16] <StanAccy> now othe second popup div is being show programatically (via an ajax call). Could this be somehow causing the bound event handlers to be lost?
[06:29:24] <StanAccy> interesting, if I set the default visibility to visible, then both close spans respond to the click.
[06:29:45] <StanAccy> oh darnit, Im replacing the blasted panel
[06:30:26] <StanAccy> I need to use .live() instead of .bind() right?
[06:30:52] <StanAccy> or just replace the inner portion of the popup div
[06:36:14] <andrew9183> use .on
[06:42:37] <StanAccy> andrew9183: Thanks
[06:46:52] <Nemesis13> does it impact performance much whether i register multiple functions to one event or only one?
[06:47:32] <Nemesis13> e.g. should i pack multiple functions inside one $(window).scroll(function(e) {} or register all separately?
[06:52:01] <_rgn> not significantly at least
[06:52:09] <_rgn> ah scroll, hmm.

[07:23:25] <Whiskey> document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/( \*+|\* | \*)/gi, "<span class=\"green\">$1</span>"); <- How do you do that best way whit jQurey?
[07:25:09] <StanAccy> Is $body a valid javascript var name?
[07:25:23] <StanAccy> from: var $body = $('body');
[07:26:01] <Whiskey> How do you mean?
[07:26:14] <StanAccy> can you use $ in variablenames?
[07:27:26] <Whiskey> yeh i think
[07:28:25] <Narwhaal> how much $? 50? 100 ?
[07:28:43] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/ <-- that is how it is now
[07:29:36] <krambiorix> i have a form with over 200 elements... I want to save the form if something is changed... What would be the best way to track those changes?
[07:30:39] <Narwhaal> http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/ doesn't that look nicer
[07:30:53] <esmic> kram: what do you mean?
[07:32:43] <krambiorix> esmic, well, i don't want to save the whole form if only one field has been changed... I would like to save that one field then....
[07:34:10] <Whiskey> thinked something like
[07:34:10] <Whiskey> $("body").html().replace(/( \*+|\* | \*)/gi, "<span class=\"green\">$1</span>");
[07:34:20] <jop008> I have a site heavily using forms 14 input form screens is joomla mobile a good choice to choose?
[07:34:48] <jop008> joomla mobile is based on jquery mobile
[07:35:59] <esmic> kram maybe something like http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2008/07/using-jquery-to-save-form-details/

[07:50:14] <holy_war_profite> I'm trying to send a simple list via ajax post, but it's not coming through. Here's my code.
[07:50:26] <holy_war_profite> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=3EnUJhn30B
[07:50:52] <esmic> first you need to
[07:51:13] <esmic> use jquery upper left select boxes
[07:51:54] <esmic> and where is the html?
[07:51:59] <esmic> for your code
[07:52:28] <holy_war_profite> hold on
[07:52:54] <holy_war_profite> its coldfusion, so look out
[07:53:45] <holy_war_profite> i think the version i'm using is even older than that
[07:59:31] <holy_war_profite> Sorry, not sure about the collaboration thing, here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/qG59G/
[08:00:09] <holy_war_profite> http://jsfiddle.net/qG59G/1/
[08:03:01] <holy_war_profite> I figured it out. I had a lot of issues.
[08:04:45] <esmic> how would i go about having multiple values in 1 select option?
[08:06:49] <holy_war_profite> you colud do a data- attribute
[08:09:40] <holy_war_profite> Here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qG59G/2/  I'm getting an error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException. how do I format a list to be sent via post?
[08:13:46] <shoky> holy_war_profite: one way would be - $.post(url, { excluded: excluded }, ...)   and then get the "excluded" post param in your cfm
[08:14:07] <shoky> you'd have to parse it too
[08:14:08] <holy_war_profite> ok, thanks, I"ll try that
[08:15:20] <holy_war_profite> Yup, that worked, thanks!
[08:28:07] <EGreg> hey guys
[08:28:09] <EGreg> I have a funny question
[08:28:11] <EGreg> ha ha
[08:28:21] <EGreg> when I use $jq.on( eventName, selector )
[08:28:29] <EGreg> is there any way the selector can be "just the immediate children of $jq"
[08:28:37] <EGreg> you can assume $jq is one element
[08:28:58] <EGreg> if not, perhaps there should be a way for selector strings to reference "the element" on which the jquery method is calle
[08:31:44] <BillCriswell> EGreg: You could do $('.foo').on('click', '> *', ...);
[08:31:58] <BillCriswell> I think that'll work at least.
[08:32:35] <EGreg> that works?
[08:32:40] <EGreg> hmm I didn't know, let me try
[08:32:56] <EGreg> why do you think it will work
[08:33:18] <BillCriswell> If I did .foo > * it would select the direct children of .foo.
[08:36:13] <BillCriswell> EGreg: You could also look into event.target
[08:36:41] <BillCriswell> Since I'm actually not having like with > *
[08:40:13] <grafi> BillCriswell EGreg probably "*" instead of "> *" ?
[08:42:35] <BillCriswell> I just tried this and it works: $('.foo').on('click', function(e){ if( this === e.target.parentNode ){ console.log('You clicked a direct child of .foo!'); });
[08:42:54] <BillCriswell> EGreg: http://jsbin.com/ibErAyI/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:44:38] <joroci> how could parentNode know be equal to the clicked element?
[08:44:43] <joroci> oops
[08:44:48] <joroci> how could parentNode be equal to the clicked element?
[08:46:17] <BillCriswell> joroci: If the parent node is the element that's handling the event. I think I worded that correctly.
[08:47:27] <BillCriswell> this would be ".foo", e.target would be the element that caused the event to bubble up to ".foo"
[08:49:11] <joroci> oh
[08:56:06] <bekabug> i have a div that's opening with .show and the blind effect. when switching between content sections it's not very smooth toward the end. it snaps open and it's kind of ugly. can someone take a look? you'll need to modify your hosts file with an IP to see it or i'd just give a link
[08:59:41] <joroci> a link would be nice :)
[09:00:10] <bekabug> ok if i PM you with the IP and URL you need for your hosts file?
[09:00:16] <joroci> ok
[09:01:27] <ChainsawCR_> Hey Guys, I need help with this. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19730465 Thanks!
[09:01:33] <bekabug> joroci: sent! Thanks :)
[09:03:05] <EGreg> but that just places it on all elements within the container
[09:03:10] <EGreg> I want to place it only on the descendants
[09:03:17] <EGreg> oh whatever I guess same thing, the filter code runs in js anyway :)
[09:10:49] <ner0x> Any way to get width including padding, borders, etc?
[09:13:01] <ner0x> Sorry about that. Connection cut out.
[09:23:24] <BillCriswell> EGreg: I'm confused.
[09:23:41] <BillCriswell> Do you want to put the event listener on each direct child of X?
[09:25:49] <rmcdaniel> how do I unset draggable's handle?

[10:39:01] <cime> hi! I'm using jQuery UI widget for a date picker... when I load the page directly (request for the whole page) it works ok, but when I load the same content using ajax it does not work, because the $(selector).datepicker() is not called after the content is loaded using ajax... what's the "right" way to solve this issue?

[10:44:18] <esmic> joroci: TY, very nice¨
[10:44:26] <joroci> np
[10:44:55] <vedic> I have jquery 1.9.1 and ui 1.10.2 included as I can see that in firebug. But if I added jquery1.8.1 in the page where I am getting this key error, it gets resolved. 1.8.1 should not be required
[10:45:53] <joroci> center exist in 1.8.1 but not 1.9.1?
[10:46:13] <vedic> joroci: Not sure about that
[10:47:13] <joroci> got a link?
[10:48:24] <vedic> joroci: Its running on localhost. jquery is added via Google cdn
[10:54:20] <vedic> joroci: ok, got it resolved. My .center() plugin was running before jquery can reach to it
[10:54:35] <vedic> reference for jquery was delayed
[10:58:29] <CodesStuff> console.log(String.fromCharCode(this._=Math.pow(!0x0+!0<<0|0>>0,this._0=-~-~-~-~-~-0)*((+!0+'00')-~0),+!0+'00'-_0,_));
[10:58:35] <CodesStuff> lolwut.
[10:59:30] <vol7ron> CodesStuff: love it
[10:59:45] <CodesStuff> vol7ron: Saw it on /r/programmerhumor
[11:00:53] <vol7ron> But I'll add-- it's not jQuery related haha
[11:01:56] <nafta_> $('#bankPerc').on('change', grossProfit); this right here...makes the grossProfit update depending on what's on bankPerc right?
[11:02:15] <nafta_> but it only does it once...I want to always check for the value of #bankPerc
[11:02:25] <nafta_> if the value changes.. then refresh
[11:02:33] <nafta_> not the page..the own value
[11:02:44] <vol7ron> nafta_: what page?
[11:02:57] <nafta_> what do you mean what page?
[11:02:59] <vol7ron> nafta_: I mean, which library
[11:03:07] <nafta_> library?
[11:03:11] <vol7ron> nafta_: I don't think grossProfit is a native jQuery function
[11:03:15] <nafta_> I'm only using jquery
[11:03:18] <nafta_> oh
[11:03:44] <nafta_> it is an internal function
[11:03:48] <nafta_> to do some calculations
[11:03:53] <BillCriswell> nafta_: What you have should update when #bankPerc changes by a user.
[11:03:56] <vol7ron> nafta_: you're question can't be answered without knowing what's inside grossProfit
[11:04:09] <vol7ron> s/you're/your/
[11:04:44] <nafta_> vol7ron: you're right..I'm going to set up a fiddle
[11:04:52] <nafta_> BillCriswell: it doesn't
[11:04:59] <nafta_> let me upload the fiddle
[11:05:05] <BillCriswell> nafta_: If you're updating #bankPerc progrmatically you probably want to do like.. $('#bankPerc').val(123.32).trigger('change');
[11:05:47] <nafta_> thing is...bankPercent gets it value from what's selected from the drop down over it
[11:05:59] <nafta_> but I want the user to be able to change that value at will
[11:06:13] <vol7ron> nafta_: fiddle it :)
[11:06:17] <nafta_> if he doesn't like the value that is there by default
[11:06:26] <vol7ron> nafta: less talky talky, more showy showy :)
[11:09:00] <nafta_> vol7ron BillCriswell here it is
[11:09:01] <nafta_> http://jsfiddle.net/NKTAb/
[11:10:02] <nafta_> my issues are bankPerc and grossProfit
[11:10:16] <nafta_> I want to change grossProfit from what's inside bankPerc
[11:10:36] <nafta_> bankPerc gets populated from productName
[11:11:01] <nafta_> but sometimes...the client could like or not what's brought to that input
[11:11:09] <nafta_> so maybe he could change it at will
[11:11:28] <nafta_> some of that code is brought to you by Velveeta
[11:11:28] <nafta_> :D
[11:11:31] <nafta_> thanks to him for it
[11:11:55] <nafta_> I bet that if he looks at it...he will remember about it...and run away
[11:12:16] <vol7ron> nafta_: there is a lot you can do to clean up and optimize that code fyi
[11:12:33] <nafta_> I know
[11:13:47] <nafta_> I think my problem is the function updateBankPerc
[11:14:01] <nafta_> which reads from what's selected
[11:14:07] <nafta_> and not from what's on the input
[11:14:09] <nafta_> right?
[11:14:56] <vol7ron> It does read from which checkbox is selected
[11:15:10] <limpc> hi. how do i convert a jQuery object (e.g. $('.element').find()) to an array so I can unshift/pop from the array?
[11:15:55] <vol7ron> limpc: get()?
[11:16:06] <_rgn> makeArray
[11:16:51] <vol7ron> limpc: are you trying to get the DOM element or create an array of the selected?
[11:16:51] <limpc> _rgn: thanks
[11:17:02] <limpc> vol7ron: _rgn's answer is what i wanted
[11:17:10] <vol7ron> limpc: my apologies
[11:17:15] <limpc> np
[11:17:39] <nafta_> bah found the issue
[11:17:43] <nafta_> much thanks
[11:26:06] <nafta_> vol7ron: how can I change this.. (View.productName.find(':selected').data('percent')) for the input on #bankPerc?
[11:28:10] <vol7ron> nafta_: what are you trying to do?
[11:29:57] <jop008> Any one experience with joomla mobile based on jquery mobile?
[11:36:39] <kpl> I have $(".c").draggable(...). I want an exception (i.e. not to make draggable) the first subdiv under div with id="a" ($("a div:eq(0)")?). How do I add that exception to $(".c").draggable(...)?
[11:40:57] <guzzlefry> hello
[11:41:31] <kpl> I suppose I should use the :not() selector, but then I would need to set a specific id or class on the "not" div.
[11:42:49] <stewbydoo4> anybody have trouble with jquery hosted lib at the moment?
[11:42:57] <stewbydoo4> or am I an idiot?
[11:43:23] <bekabug> i was using the google jquery UI and it was causing errors on the page until I removed the reference
[11:43:49] <bekabug> i hadn't even written a function using it yet and it was giving errors.
[11:43:50] <stewbydoo4> I mean I keep getting a $ is undefined which means it can't find it
[11:44:06] <bekabug> yes. same thing
[11:44:07] <stewbydoo4> but when I click the linkt to it
[11:44:08] <stewbydoo4> its there
[11:44:14] <bekabug> except mine said jQuery is undefined
[11:44:18] <guzzlefry> $.get("/videos/", {ajax: 1,page: page}); I have this ajax call here. When changing it to $.get("/" + window.location.pathname, {ajax: 1,page: page}); the URL decided to change to http://videos/keyword/art/?ajax=1&page=2
[11:44:43] <stewbydoo4> guess I'll just download it
[11:44:51] <guzzlefry> The first call works fine and does http://localhost/videos/?ajax=1&page=2
[11:45:18] <kpl> The solution seems to be: $(".c:not(#a>div:eq(0)").draggable(...)
[11:46:12] <guzzlefry> oh, I see
[11:46:27] <guzzlefry> window.location.pathname already has the leading slash.
[11:54:20] <joroci> ooh :)
[11:55:54] <lacrymology> in https://oriane.openmustardseed.org/private_registry/personas/ in the source called P_Personas.js, the event linked in L144 is not called on click, any clues why?
[11:56:46] <lacrymology> at the moment of the call to .on the "#persona-attributes li a" don't exist, but at the moment of the click ".personas persona-attributes li a" return the expected data
[11:58:56] <lacrymology> I'm guessing soemthing inbetween is catching the event and stopping it from bubbling, but I don't know how to debug that
[12:01:16] <joroci> lacrymology: why this '#persona-attributes li a' as data?
[12:01:48] <joroci> oh
[12:03:35] <lacrymology> joroci: I don't understand the question, but I'm playing with the live code
[12:03:48] <lacrymology> joroci: by "data" I meant the right elements, sorry
[12:07:19] <joroci> why do you attach the event to the parent div?
[12:08:14] <joroci> add class to a
[12:08:19] <joroci> to the anchor
[12:10:02] <lacrymology> joroci: because the elements don't exist when the .on is called
[12:10:38] <lacrymology> joroci: it's supposed to be a delegated event? they're supposed to work for "future" elements?
[12:13:52] <joroci> lacrymology it's the same command
[12:14:08] <joroci> oh
[12:14:50] <lacrymology> joroci: I'm pretty sure that particular line of code is right, I'm wondering if someone can help me figure out why isn't the event reaching my handler
[12:22:27] <_August_> I need a suggestion, you know how your filling out a form and you click tab on the keyboard to go to the next form field. Well im trying to make it skip radio fields. Any suggestions?
[12:23:44] <joroci> lacrymology if it was correct, attaching the events after the elements are there
[12:23:49] <joroci> would work
[12:23:51] <joroci> but it's not
[12:24:16] <Kryztoval> Wow
[12:24:25] <Kryztoval> glad to see people still use IRC :)
[12:36:22] <boze> how could I get .find().each() to skip a div thats hidden? http://jsfiddle.net/tMVdm/2/ the hidden div gets a border too :(
[12:38:44] <boze> ergh I'm overthinking it. ':input:visible' works!
[12:45:04] <LoneSoldier728> hey so when I click a button I want to call that element
[12:45:23] <LoneSoldier728> how do I say this element
[12:45:45] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: this
[12:45:51] <LoneSoldier728> there is a bunch of buttons that have the same class but i want the one that was pressed
[12:46:18] <boze> $(this).attr('class') <-- maybe
[12:46:19] <LoneSoldier728> this tho
[12:46:24] <LoneSoldier728> does not refer to it
[12:46:28] <LoneSoldier728> ok let me expand sorry
[12:46:34] <LoneSoldier728> so this is within a backbone view
[12:46:42] <LoneSoldier728> and when the button gets clicked I call a funtion
[12:46:59] <LoneSoldier728> so I need to somehow say this for the button, when i call this
[12:47:05] <LoneSoldier728> in the function it refers to the view
[12:47:11] <LoneSoldier728> and the this is lost from the element
[12:47:21] <LoneSoldier728> so i need to either pass it in somehow but not sure how to
[12:48:52] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: I'd need ot see the code.
[12:49:52] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[12:49:56] <LoneSoldier728> pastebinning it
[12:50:43] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/7eR1pmFC
[12:50:46] <LoneSoldier728> ok so the top is the view
[12:50:52] <LoneSoldier728> the template is on the bottom
[12:50:58] <LoneSoldier728> i care about the youtubeA function
[12:51:10] <LoneSoldier728> the click in the events - line 17
[12:52:31] <Toerkeium> join #css
[12:52:38] <Toerkeium> buff
[12:57:24] <LoneSoldier728> got it
[13:02:22] <Fenikkusu> Will someone please point in the right direction on intercepting the dialog that shows in the browser corner when an ajax call fails?
[13:04:30] <jedimind> there's a dialog for failed ajax ?
[13:04:53] <jedimind> which browser?
[13:04:55] <Fenikkusu> Unless something else is generating it that I'm unaware of, yes.
[13:15:45] <lacrymology> joroci: don't you think some other parent between the span and the div.personas might be catching and stopping the event?
[13:17:11] <joroci> it shouldn't
[13:17:45] <joroci> i would give a class to the attributes and replace it with the data selector
[13:18:24] <joroci> i mean add class to the anchor tag
[13:22:38] <joroci> to be more specific
[13:32:46] <xebra>  hi, what's the standard/common/best/etc. way to avoid double actions in web applications? (like, avoid triggering events again before they are completed). I thought of a variable like "waiting_mode" to check before starting an action, set to "true" if something is already going on. Comments?
[13:33:51] <xebra> hmm, oops, maybe I should have asked that on the javascript channel.
[13:49:49] <eierhuhn> wow, 908 users and no talk
[13:50:25] <LessSeen> all work
[13:50:30] <LessSeen> :)
[13:50:54] <eierhuhn> please, ask some questions. I'd like to answer :P
[13:51:18] <LessSeen> what is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?
[13:52:22] <eierhuhn> i mean, about jQuery
[13:52:56] <jedimind> LessSeen 42
[13:55:41] <joroci> why the q in jQuery is upper case?
[13:55:56] <jedimind> camel case
[13:56:07] <joroci> who thought about the name
[13:56:32] <joroci> i mean who came up with the name
[14:06:23] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here work with youtube's api?
[14:07:40] <LoneSoldier728> I see two diff types of url not sure which one I should be using... https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos or http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/
[14:09:15] <NoiseEee> LoneSoldier728: sounds like the former
[14:09:36] <NoiseEee> its a google API, it specifies an API version...  generally legit signs.
[14:10:03] <LoneSoldier728> kk thanks
[14:18:21] <LoneSoldier728> how can I call an api from localhost
[14:18:24] <LoneSoldier728> is it possible?
[14:18:58] <NoiseEee> via your backend language
[14:19:17] <LoneSoldier728> i cant do it clientside?
[14:19:52] <LoneSoldier728> i am calling a get request when a button is clicked client side
[14:20:38] <eierhuhn> LoneSoldier728, please specify your problem
[14:21:36] <LoneSoldier728> trying to call a get to youtube's api
[14:21:49] <LoneSoldier728> but it is error-ing i am using localhost to test it
[14:22:47] <eierhuhn> what error?
[14:22:55] <NoiseEee> you can't do cross-origin XHR, if thats what you're essentially asking LoneSoldier728
[14:23:45] <LoneSoldier728> ya i was wondering if there was a way around it because I didnt want to try it live
[14:23:50] <LoneSoldier728> error 400
[14:26:49] <NoiseEee> well error 400 from an http error is an access issue
[14:27:02] <NoiseEee> access/login/protected etc
[14:27:16] <LoneSoldier728> so is that
[14:27:22] <LoneSoldier728> not a cross browser issue then
[14:27:52] <LoneSoldier728> the thing is, if I am making a general request that does not require authentication
[14:27:52] <eierhuhn> cross browser? lol
[14:28:05] <LoneSoldier728> shouldn't it work...
[14:28:13] <LoneSoldier728> as long as I have my api key
[14:28:24] <eierhuhn> read about same-origin-policy
[14:28:32] <LoneSoldier728> i meant
[14:28:36] <LoneSoldier728> cross origin issue
[14:28:38] <LoneSoldier728> lol
[14:41:07] <Ortund> why does my click event work only once between refreshes?
[14:41:39] <shoky> how should we know?
[14:41:46] <Ortund> example... if I try to submit my form to ajax with missing values, the click will work. If it then try to submit the form again with all required values there, it does nothing
[14:45:56] <Ortund> it feels like I have something wrong in this code actually... http://jsfiddle.net/fFWvT/
[14:46:49] <shoky> Ortund: you're not calling validateForm
[14:47:20] <Ortund> isn't the if statement in the click event doing that?
[14:47:26] <Ortund> or am I thinking too much in C#?
[14:47:29] <shoky> no. how do you call a function?
[14:47:34] <shoky> it'd be the same in C#
[14:48:05] <Ortund> well there you go... in c#, I'd do if (functionname) { // returned true } else { // returned false }
[14:48:10] <shoky> no, you wouldn't
[14:48:26] <shoky> how do you call a function?
[14:48:33] <Ortund> so I have to declare var formvalid = validateForm(); ?
[14:48:42] <shoky> you don't have to put it in a var
[14:49:40] <shoky> also.. you're not submitting anything here, but i'll assume that part is missing..
[14:50:03] <Ortund> ya, the jsfiddle is just to test whether the validation works
[14:50:17] <shoky> k
[14:50:47] <Ortund> this doesn't seem to be doing anything differently though http://jsfiddle.net/mpjPw/
[14:51:02] <shoky> eh
[14:51:17] <shoky> and you can't figure it out?
[14:51:25] <shoky> don't be lazy
[14:51:55] <shoky> when i said you don't have to put it in a var
[14:52:05] <shoky> i didn't mean that you should omit the "var" keyword...
[14:52:18] <shoky> dude.. if (validateForm()) { ... } else { ... }
[14:53:09] <Ortund> I honestly didn't see that X_X
[14:53:49] * Ortund wonders if that's what's meant by "going blind on ________"
[14:55:09] <shoky> mmhmm ;p
[14:55:16] <joroci> tasty
[14:55:30] <shoky> don't make me hungry now
[14:55:37] <joroci> you said mhmmhm
[14:56:33] <shoky> sounds different to me ;S
[15:04:07] <nafta> hehe I have a fun problem. I have a form...in that form I have an input with name Gross Profit, other one named Net Profit, and the other named Commission. Thing is that..Net Profit comes first...to calculate afterwards the Commission based on that amount. But..once the Commission gets showed...it should then again update the Net Profit - Commission...any ideas on how to do that?
[15:04:09] <nafta> thanks
[15:05:14] <shoky> nafta: make a jsfiddle showing your issue
[15:05:48] <shoky> cause otherwise my answer is "yes"
[15:06:31] <nafta> lol
[15:06:32] <nafta> ok
[15:06:49] <Erneston> hi
[15:10:20] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone  i submit form with $("a[action='read']").click(function(e){ $( "#process" ).submit(); });
[15:10:31] <jarr0dsz> so based on a link with id = action it submits the form with id process
[15:10:45] <shoky> id=action ?
[15:10:47] <jarr0dsz> but how could i send an extra param from the jquery call? i want to sent the action = "read" also
[15:11:21] <jarr0dsz> form id="action" but not that much important i try figure out how to pass an extra param from the $( "#process" ).submit();
[15:11:35] <shoky> if you're actually submitting a form then you need to add an <input> to it
[15:12:01] <shoky> if you'd submit it via ajax you could set up your own params object
[15:20:53] <Erneston> can anyone pls help: http://jsfiddle.net/L9mGU/41/
[15:20:53] <Erneston> i am trying to move the background position up on click
[15:20:53] <Erneston> only on the Y axis
[15:23:22] <shoky> Erneston: you wrote postion instead of position, and there is no #pattern element. also, += stuff will only work on single-number properties
[15:23:52] <shoky> Erneston: this is one way, but i think it won't work on FF or smoething http://jsfiddle.net/L9mGU/47/
[15:27:12] <Erston> jesus
[15:29:55] <Erston> ok this is what i have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/L9mGU/55/
[15:30:00] <Erston> it moves up once on click onyl
[15:30:01] <shoky> Erston: also you have background-position:0,0;  in your css instead of  0 0;
[15:30:02] <Erston> only*
[15:30:14] <nafta> how can I make a single drop down to flush all the form on change?
[15:30:33] <Erston> http://jsfiddle.net/L9mGU/56/ < latest
[15:31:10] <shoky> Erston: if you put var x inside the click handler, it'll be a new local x on each click
[15:31:39] <shoky> Erston: http://jsfiddle.net/L9mGU/57/
[15:31:47] <Erston> arrr
[15:32:00] <shoky> (will only work if the bg position starts with pixel coordinates)
[15:32:07] <Erston> oky your example is more advanced :o
[15:32:25] <shoky> yes, gotta do some dirty work to make it happen
[15:32:42] <shoky> tho your way with the var x could work too if that's enough for you
[15:32:46] <shoky> just put the var outside the click handler
[15:33:08] <Erston> so its splitting the value pair
[15:33:23] <Erston> into 2 variables which are parsed floats
[15:33:29] <shoky> yup
[15:33:49] <Erston> y is being incremented 10
[15:34:02] <Erston> and the last last i understand
[15:34:14] <Erston> its the use of split, and array that lost me
[15:34:27] <Erston> is that a form of array bgPos[0] ?
[15:34:38] <shoky> .split(' ')  returns an array
[15:34:43] <shoky> i put that array in a var called bgPos
[15:35:07] <shoky> bgPos[0] means  the first element in the array
[15:35:19] <shoky> i.e. the x position
[15:35:24] <Erston> i got that part
[15:35:36] <Erston> i dont have knowledge to thing of splitting
[15:35:40] <Erston> and so on
[15:35:41] <Erston> :(
[15:35:47] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[15:37:01] <shoky> js> print( "10px 25px".split(' ') )
[15:37:05] <b-ot> shoky: 10px,25px
[15:37:18] <shoky> well, that's how b-ot prints an array of strings
[15:37:29] <Erston> thanx
[15:37:33] <shoky> it's really returning  ["10px", "25px"]
[15:37:37] <Erston> trying to get this example into my example offline
[15:40:20] <Erston> shoky are you this good @ css ?
[15:46:45] <jaCen915> Does anyone know how to programmatically set a UI slider and also trigger the event for it?
[15:48:15] <shoky> Erston: donno what you mean ;;p
[15:48:49] <shoky> jaCen915: .trigger('slide')  ?
[15:49:29] <jaCen915> shoky: doesn't work…have a console.log on slide event, triggering the event on the slider itself…perhaps I need to trigger on something else
[15:49:49] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[15:50:22] <Erston> is there a way to control the direction based on scroll up or down? instead of scroll in general ?
[15:52:27] <shoky> hm?
[15:53:21] <jaCen915> shoky: found it, trigger "change" and include it as an event listener for initialization
[16:18:30] <TeddyMurray> hiya
[16:46:18] <Ericx2x> should i use jquery 1 or jquery 2 for my latest website?
[16:48:01] <shoky> Ericx2x: do you know the difference between them?
[16:49:33] <Ericx2x> no
[16:56:52] <shoky> Ericx2x: http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[17:31:32] <nafta> if I submit a form...and then hit the back button...how can I reset the form?
[17:34:42] <Narwhaal> bake a cookie
[17:43:24] <nafta> anyone around?
[17:43:26] <nafta> Velveeta: ?
[17:43:26] <nafta> :D
[17:43:35] <Velveeta> nafta: !
[17:43:39] <nafta> how are you?
[17:43:56] <Velveeta> doin alright, reading an article from my javascript weekly :)
[17:44:00] <nafta> I have a question bro, I can't think of nothing that works..
[17:44:11] <Velveeta> throw it out there
[17:44:48] <nafta> if a user completes the form...and hits..."submit"....if the user after hitting submit goes back...I want to reset the whole form....but I don't know how...this form is populated with ajax...etc...
[17:46:06] <Velveeta> i don't think i'm following… if they submit what form? and what is the problem you're actually experiencing when they go back currently?
[17:47:32] <nafta> Velveeta: I want to reset the form on page load...basically.....because if the user hits the back button AFTER submitting the form...I want it to start over
[17:48:49] <nafta> or maybe I could reset the form after hitting the submit button?
[17:50:45] <Velveeta> so… can you not just do something like form.reset() on document.ready?
[17:52:00] <nafta> *shrug*
[17:52:03] <nafta> it isn't working
[17:52:04] <nafta> I tried
[17:53:35] <Velveeta> well, you could try grabbing all :input elements and setting their .val('') or something
[17:53:51] <Velveeta> i mean, without more informationon this, it's hard to give you any real advice
[17:53:57] <Velveeta> or without seeing the site in question
[18:34:05] <nafta> how can I pass data attr thru POST?
[18:39:34] <tjz> hello guys :)
[18:55:39] <Rarrikins> Is there a way to click a button using jQuery?
[18:59:05] <Velveeta> $('button').click()
[18:59:16] <Velveeta> or $('button').trigger('click')
[19:12:17] <Rarrikins> Velveeta: Thanks
[19:12:31] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:14:44] <abjorn> hi
[19:15:02] <abjorn> how do i jqueries
[19:20:13] <tw2113> stick $ in the browser's gstring abjorn
[19:20:47] <tw2113> er $()
[19:20:51] <abjorn> b-baka! like I would want to do t-that!
[19:22:01] <abjorn> maybe the tsundere joke was a miscalculation for #jquery
[19:37:43] <mattdawson> hi - i have a ajax request that i abort if i get a cache hit that i pull from local storage. doing this, any attached success callbacks don't fire. is there a way to make the request act like it was successful
[19:37:44] <mattdawson> ?
[19:45:40] <aro> the ajax event has other callbacks
[19:45:42] <aro> try those
[19:50:57] <mattdawson> aro: but i need it to look like a success - i won't always get a cache hit
[19:53:12] <Svetlana> Hi, I use $foo.prepend("Hi!");, but I'd like to include a larger chunk (few tens of lines), how is it possible to use line breaks?
[19:55:13] <tw2113> $foo.prepend("Hi!<br/>Yo!"); ?
[19:55:35] <Svetlana> well it's few tens of lines, for readability it'd be useful to have them separate
[19:55:54] <tw2113> concatenate a variable with it all
[19:55:59] <tw2113> $foo.prepend(mytext);
[20:18:41] <Billy2> Hey everyone, I'm having a problem with jquery find in IE8 (surprise surprise) - The error is "Object doesn't support this property or method" on a piece of code, the code is: http://jsfiddle.net/SGHA5/1/
[20:45:09] <nafta> Velveeta: you around? this time is a good question
[20:45:10] <nafta> haha
[20:46:18] <nafta> I have this option in a select <option value="1" data-brokerid="14" data-broker_perc="20">Cliente: Client One | Ejecutivo: Marlo Ovalles % 20</option> how can I pass data-brokerid thru a form to a php script?
[20:52:13] <blade3> Can anyone help me? I'm a total jsnewb. I need to input certain zipcodes and attach percentage increases to the original price (calculated based on the amount of the subtotal).  >  JFIDDLE  >  http://jsfiddle.net/vxupE/62/
[20:58:52] <daveP> nafta easiest way seems to be to have the data-brokerid as part of the value
[20:59:24] <daveP> and then separate it after POSTing the form
[20:59:43] <nafta> any idea on how to put it on the value daveP ?
[21:02:02] <daveP> eg <option value="1_14"
[21:02:43] <nafta> but I'm building that option from ajax daveP
[21:03:26] <daveP> okay, does it have to be as a separate option?
[21:04:22] <daveP> and if you're building it from ajax, can you not use that same data ajax is pushing to go straight into a php variable?
[21:06:25] <nafta> daveP: any idea on how to do that on submit?
[21:09:16] <daveP> I wouldn't have it as a separate parameter in the select option, if you need it posted and don't want to call the data again from the server, you'll have to post everything you need
[21:10:06] <daveP> get ajax putting all the values you want into the value field, so it would be 1_14_20 in your example
[21:10:24] <daveP> and then separate it back out on the next page
[21:10:37] <daveP> if that makes sense ha
[21:10:42] <daveP> it's late here
[21:12:51] <nafta> alright thanks daveP
[21:13:26] <daveP> np
[21:17:15] <daveP> My location: London, United Kingdom
[21:59:28] <nafta> I can't believe this is slowing me down this much
[22:30:38] <bobdobbs> hey guys. I'm having trouble with this preventing the default action.
[22:31:04] <bobdobbs> The code from my test case looks like this: http://hastebin.com/boqalunuqe.xml
[22:31:23] <bobdobbs> If I put something in the input and hit return, the page reloads
[22:31:43] <bobdobbs> my expectation is that I should just see the debug message in console
[22:37:21] <bobdobbs> oh, I got it. I should have targetted the form. not the input.
[23:50:09] <Stephen> Hola folks
