[00:04:40] <becom33> hi is there a way to put jquery mobile panel li a button to the bottom of the panel . because when I try position:fixed it messup the css style
[00:38:39] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:38:53] <sejo> of a list of checkboxes with the same name, how do I get a list of their values $('input[name=<name>]:checked').val() only shows 1 value
[00:39:58] <fabioportieri> sejo: you have to iterate above the collection returned
[00:40:24] <fabioportieri> try .each() instead of val
[00:40:28] <ravenzz> or map them into an array and join them
[00:41:01] <sejo> ok, I was doing that but wanted to verify there wasn't already a jquery way of doing it
[00:41:21] <ravenzz> that's the jQuery version of doing that
[00:41:39] <ravenzz> s/version/way
[00:44:29] <gry> document.editform.wpTextbox1.value how is this in jQuery? I don't parse the meaning
[01:35:28] <Cork> gry: that looks like a wordpress thing
[01:38:46] <seutje> how do u go about debugging a chrome tab completely hanging?
[01:39:26] <seutje> besides stepping through from the start and checking where it stops responding?
[01:39:43] <gry> Cork, ?
[01:40:10] <Cork> gry> document.editform.wpTextbox1.value how is this in jQuery? I don't parse the meaning <--
[01:40:27] <gry> oh, it's a wiki thing. it appears to be a thing I don't have in my use-case
[01:42:01] <Cork> seutje: never had a tab hang in chrome, doesn't it have a hang detection?
[01:42:22] <seutje> yeah, must be doing something special
[01:42:38] <Jensen__> Hi, would here be any reason why a $.each would be executed asynch? I'm doing an append before and after it and while doing that each and the output that gets genereated contains the bits added by the append before and after followed by the each. I  could provide a fiddle.
[01:42:55] <seutje> figured my map application could handle provinces in just the same way as townships
[01:43:06] <seutje> until I clicked a province that has the same name as a township
[01:43:13] <seutje> that's when the tab hangs
[01:43:27] <seutje> guess I'll get stepping q.q
[01:46:31] <seutje> lol, was a silly typo in my check if the currently selected township is in the currently selected province, causing undefined to be compared to a string, causing infinite recursion
[01:46:39] <seutje> silly that chrome didn't catch that though
[01:46:54] <Cork> Jensen__: no it isn't
[01:47:05] <Cork> Jensen__: things you call in it might be though
[01:48:29] <Jensen__> The only thing i call in it is $("selection").append :(
[01:49:00] <Cork> Jensen__: could you share the full section?
[01:49:46] <Cork> Jensen__: .each is literally a helper function that do some preparation work and then runs a for loop
[01:49:53] <Cork> so it can't cause async
[01:50:14] <Amnesia> hi, question
[01:50:23] <Amnesia> I've bound an ajax request to a button event
[01:50:50] <Amnesia> but when people keep bashing the button, multiple ajax requests are being made (before the page refreshes, as the event handler also refreshes the page)
[01:51:18] <Cork> Amnesia: there is several options
[01:51:21] <Amnesia> is there some way to disable a event handler after it has been triggered, until the page has reloaded?
[01:51:29] <Cork> you can disable the button in the event handler
[01:51:35] <Cork> and on always from ajax enable it again
[01:51:41] <Amnesia> hm good one!
[01:51:43] <Amnesia> ty!
[01:53:43] <Amnesia> should've thought 'bout that myself^^
[01:53:49] <Amnesia> sorry for the recurring spam^^
[01:53:54] <Cork> lol np
[01:54:22] <Jensen__> Here's a fiddle with it: http://jsfiddle.net/ZpgxY/2/ As you can see if you view the source of the Resut it's not exactly what it should be. At least for firefox there is a closing </table> where it shouldn't be and the <td> are not there they should.
[01:54:24] <Cork> it actually isn't as simple as it sounds when you have the answer
[01:55:28] <Cork> Jensen__: dom isn't html
[01:55:36] <Cork> you can't add partial elements to a dom
[01:55:48] <Cork> so in line 8 you add a table
[01:55:56] <Cork> in line 9 you add a th after the table
[01:56:09] <Cork> line 10 you add a td after the th
[01:56:12] <Cork> then the td loop
[01:56:17] <Jensen__> Ah OK. That's my screwup. Thanks for pointing it out!
[01:56:19] <Cork> then you add an invalid close tag
[01:56:20] <Cork> and so on
[01:56:24] <Amnesia> Cork: $('button.clone').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); ?
[01:56:29] <Cork> no
[01:56:40] <Cork> prop('disabled', true/false)
[01:56:48] <Cork> true in your case
[01:56:53] <Amnesia> I see
[01:56:57] <Amnesia> almost^^
[01:57:02] <Amnesia> ty again for your patience
[01:57:08] <Cork> yw
[01:57:25] <Jensen__> If i generate what i want as a string and add i as  whole it should work, right?
[01:57:40] <Cork> yes
[01:58:06] <Cork> you could generate the elements and append them instead
[01:58:16] <Cork> its all up to how you prefer to work with it
[01:58:56] <Jensen__> Is there a prefered way for doing something like this or is it just a case to case thing?
[01:59:17] <Cork> Jensen__: there is a few base things
[01:59:33] <Cork> you should try to keep down the number of times you append to the main document in the page
[01:59:47] <Cork> so if you generate the elements one by one, make a fragment with all the elements
[01:59:48] <Rhytz> Can I post a link to a StackExchange question here?
[01:59:51] <Cork> and then append them all
[01:59:59] <Rhytz> *stackoverflow
[02:00:08] <Cork> Jensen__: alternatively generate the full html and add it in one go
[02:00:17] <Cork> Jensen__: adding the full html string is faster
[02:00:25] <Jensen__> Mhm, thanks for being so helpful! :)
[02:00:29] <Cork> cause the dom parser is optimized to handle that
[02:00:41] <Cork> but the code tends to be nastier to look at
[02:00:51] <Cork> so it is a question what you want to prioritize
[02:00:59] <Cork> readability if it doesn't happen a lot
[02:01:09] <Cork> and speed if it is a busy code section
[02:01:18] <Cork> (i would say)
[02:02:08] <Rhytz> lol hey johnline
[02:02:46] <Jensen__> Tough to decide. Guess i'm going to do what works best for now and maybe change it later. Shouldn't be that hard for this section.
[02:03:59] <johnline> helo
[02:04:14] <johnline> i know my rhytz
[02:04:35] <Rhytz> didnt expect you here, haha
[02:05:05] <johnline> where else am i
[02:05:08] <Rhytz> #mta
[02:05:11] <johnline> ohs
[02:06:49] <Rhytz> Anyway, can anyone help me out with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21321338/refreshing-parts-of-div-within-a-jquery-loaded-div-every-few-seconds
[02:07:00] <Jensen__> HAve nice day Cork ! :)
[02:07:06] <Cork> same
[02:11:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: getting error NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Failure 	  xmlhttp.send();
[02:11:39] <lemonsparrow> while trying to fetch an xml over ajax
[02:11:49] <Cork> same domain?
[02:12:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no different ip
[02:12:27] <lemonsparrow> I dont have any server running on my machine
[02:12:32] <Cork> cors configured?
[02:12:49] <Cork> then that is most likely the cause
[02:12:56] <Cork> you don't have headers so you can't allow things
[02:13:20] <Cork> you should basically never try to run web things without a server
[02:13:25] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this is input
[02:13:31] <lemonsparrow> http://10.136.25.72/standardCmdList.xml
[02:13:39] <lemonsparrow> Cork: code http://pastebin.com/Uv3Rd0QZ
[02:13:43] <Cork> can't access you privat ip :)
[02:14:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no I am just telling u mu input format and code to get it :)
[02:14:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well you most likely can't do that
[02:14:27] <Cork> but check the browsers console it should state it there
[02:14:33] <Cork> alternatively check the network tab
[02:14:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so I should run server in my local ?
[02:14:41] <Cork> yes
[02:14:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: my friend is running server so he is just giving localhost/
[02:14:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and it works
[02:15:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am just trying to access it over his ip... shouldnt it work then ?
[02:15:24] <Cork> lemonsparrow: depends on what cors he gives
[02:15:30] <Cork> but again check the browser console
[02:15:33] <Cork> it will show you
[02:15:52] <Cork> but local file has higher limitations then anything else
[02:15:58] <OOPMan> Hey all
[02:16:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: cors ?
[02:16:05] <Cork> so i'm not even sure if you can do ajax calls from it at all
[02:16:13] <Cork> Cross Domain Request
[02:16:18] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[02:16:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Failure 	  xmlhttp.send();
[02:16:20] <b-ot> Cork: CORS - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[02:16:25] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am using the same code
[02:16:39] <Cork> lemonsparrow: where is it running from?
[02:16:48] <Cork> file:// ?
[02:16:53] <OOPMan> I have a quick question: Say I select some elements like $("select") and store that in a variable. Later I add a new select to the page. Is there a method I can call on the variable with the previous jquery resultset to cause it to re-run?
[02:17:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost/standardCmdList.xml. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[02:17:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: in chrome
[02:17:17] <Cork> OOPMan: old_var = $("select");
[02:17:32] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so cors is the cause
[02:18:01] <Cork> lemonsparrow: to do cross domain ajax calls the remote server needs to allow you
[02:18:04] <OOPMan> :-/
[02:18:08] <OOPMan> No run-run :-/
[02:18:11] <OOPMan> Oh well
[02:18:36] <Cork> OOPMan: the selector isn't even stored in jquery so no it can't do it
[02:18:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok here the server on his machine isnt letting  my call process ?
[02:18:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: no the browser doesn't
[02:19:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[02:19:07] <Cork> cause it asks the server if it allows it, and the server doesn't say "yes"
[02:19:11] <Cork> it most likely doesn't say anything
[02:19:30] <Cork> cause the header has to be explicitly added
[02:21:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so what is the fix to this from my end ?
[02:22:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: none
[02:22:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so no remedy to this ? :)
[02:22:15] <Cork> expect proxying the request over your own server
[02:22:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thats too much ;) for a small task
[02:22:39] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the limitation is explicitly implemented so you as the requeste can't control it
[02:22:46] <Cork> its the entire point of it
[02:22:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: got it
[02:50:37] <vsgill> Can someone help me, this line doesn't work in IE8/9: window.history.pushState("","", "?view="+id);
[02:50:50] <vsgill> It says Object doesn't support this property or method

[02:55:24] <Cork> you might need to use something else if you need legacy browser support
[02:56:46] <Naeb> Cork: yeah except my server tells me the form is invalid
[02:57:02] <Naeb> and I don't see the uploaded file either, just the other data
[02:57:07] <Naeb> (this is Django btw)
[02:57:13] <Cork> Naeb: sounds like the server codes doesn't know how to handler file uploads then
[02:58:53] <Cork> Naeb: have you disabled processData in ajax?
[02:59:01] <Naeb> ^ nope
[02:59:07] <Naeb> hm
[02:59:19] <Cork> you need to do that else FormData will be filtered
[03:19:25] <vsgill> Cork, that history.js solved the issue
[03:19:27] <vsgill> Thanks for that

[03:39:37] <scarlet_razor> hii... bro...
[03:40:01] <scarlet_razor> how to change the posted datepicker when localize to other date format ?
[03:43:25] <scarlet_razor> hello bro... any suggest :)
[04:40:12] <Jensen> Hi everyone, i'm adding a bunch of elements to the dom (a table) and would like to register a click event to the td element. Before 1.7 i'd have used .live, as far as i can tell, how would i attach the event handler now? on doesn't seem to work.
[04:40:53] <Cork> ?g delegate site:api.jquery.com
[04:40:55] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:41:06] <Cork> Jensen: read up on what replaced .live
[04:41:23] <Cork> it can also be expressed in the .on syntax, but be sure to read the docs first
[04:41:39] <Jensen> Ok :)
[05:14:32] <rethus> Which event is fired on i select-Tag if i choosed one option?
[05:14:51] <rethus> $('#chooseContact').click ?
[06:14:19] <scarlet_razor> after calling datepicker ui method, why it called the datepicker twice
[06:14:42] <scarlet_razor> sorry for not saying any introduction... :)
[06:14:52] <scarlet_razor> does anybody know why ?
[06:24:54] <Cork> scarlet_razor: not sure what you mean
[06:25:00] <Cork> what method?
[06:25:31] <Cork> or rather what is called twice?
[06:27:41] <Justice> Im a bit new but i was looking at = http://p.ar2oor.pl/cprogress/
[06:27:56] <Justice> is that only time based? or can i actually send real values to it?
[06:29:56] <Cork> Justice: the animation looks like its purely timer based
[06:30:45] <Justice> meh just as I thought... you got any ideas on a similar one with actual values?
[06:30:58] <Justice> ie maxvalue and a input value to give it
[06:31:52] <Cork> donno never looked for one
[06:32:49] <Cork> Justice: but the animation is meant to smooth out when you give it new values
[06:33:02] <rootshift> sorry, not completely related to this channel, but I'm struggling to find a jquery plugin, it can also allow css3 transitions but here is a little idea of what I'm wanting - http://imgur.com/VEviUoD these will be youtube videos that you can cycle between. I have only ever seen thumbnails below.
[06:33:08] <Cork> Justice: normally you just set the current value to a progressbar
[06:33:27] <Justice> Cork: yeah that what i was hoping for for this one :P
[06:33:33] <Justice> when i started to implement it ^^
[06:35:00] <Cork> Justice: well so call the plugin and change the percent value
[06:35:22] <Cork> only guessing a but though
[06:35:26] <PatBateman> hi , if I do sitebuild and i dont know the final address of the page , "go to home" link could be <a href="/"></a> is right?
[06:35:35] <Cork> as there doesn't seam to be any documentation what so ever...
[06:36:13] <Cork> PatBateman: yes you can have absolute addresses instead of full domain addresses if that is what you mean
[06:36:29] <PatBateman> thanks, so forward slash is good
[06:36:31] <Cork> PatBateman: it's even normally recommended
[06:37:08] <Cork> PatBateman: protocol://domain ex. http://www.example.com/page/file.html is a full url
[06:37:18] <Cork> PatBateman: /page/file.html is an absolute url
[06:37:23] <PatBateman> sure
[06:37:26] <Cork> PatBateman: and file.html is a relative url
[06:37:30] <Cork> all is valid in a tags
[06:37:40] <Cork> *all of them are valid
[06:37:41] <PatBateman> yeah i ask on validity really
[06:37:50] <Cork> all of them are
[06:38:36] <Cork> Justice: you might like this one though http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/
[06:41:26] <Justice> oh
[06:41:43] <codepython777> whats the difference between:  $(window).resize(); and  $(window).trigger('resize');
[06:42:36] <Cork> codepython777: the first one runs the second one internally
[06:42:45] <Cork> (it's a shorthand)
[06:43:00] <codepython777> thanks
[06:43:59] <Cork> all of those .<event name> is shorthands for binding and firing events
[06:44:01] <NoiseEee> codepython777: also the second would fire any associated event handlers; the first would not
[06:44:04] <NoiseEee> kinx
[06:44:06] <NoiseEee> er jinx
[06:44:14] <Cork> NoiseEee: it will
[06:44:29] <Cork> they are identical in that regard
[06:44:45] <codepython777> I'd like to replace this line: $("div#disqus_thread").toggle(); with something that uses off screen hiding. Is there a 3 liner that can do this?
[06:45:04] <Cork> codepython777: use .data()
[06:45:06] <codepython777> so instead of display:none, the div is placed off screen vs on screen
[06:45:12] <Cork> and a simple switch statement
[06:46:06] <Cork> codepython777: and html doesn't really have an offscreen concept
[06:50:48] <flexd> Uh, do any of you have experience with Markup.js ? I am having the oddest problem with Markup.js and jquery-dynatable heh.
[06:54:19] <rethus> I try to send some json via ajax, but seems. the json is not valid. A print_r($_REQUEST); in the target-php-file, give not the json-parameters back. http://jsfiddle.net/N4PKN/
[06:54:23] <relipse> I'm using jquery mobile and I put a <a href="my.pdf" data-ajax="false">HERE</a> but it is not clickable inside a <label> tag, even though another <a href tag works fine
[06:55:53] <Cork> relipse: firstly http://jsfiddle.net/N4PKN/1/
[06:55:56] <rethus> thats the exact source, which is send:   {"id_contact":1,"articleId":106}
[06:56:03] <rethus> isn't it json valid?
[06:56:14] <Cork> doesn't really matter
[06:56:17] <Cork> it isn't valid params
[06:56:28] <relipse> cork you d;idnt mean me
[06:56:58] <Cork> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/N4PKN/3/
[06:56:59] <rethus> Cork: could you give me a hint, whats wrong with md params?
[06:57:11] <relipse> stop pingiong me
[06:57:11] <Cork> relipse: opps sorry
[06:57:31] <Cork> rethus: params always have to be key: value
[06:57:45] <rethus> so no quoted?
[06:57:49] <Cork> rethus: if you want to send json over it you need to have a key that holds it
[06:57:59] <Cork> rethus: notice the JSON.stringify
[06:58:38] <Cork> rethus: the first update i gave you sends pure params not json
[06:58:59] <Cork> and for the simple structure you have it is most likely the better option
[07:00:36] <rethus> great, works now.
[07:00:57] <rethus> so my fault was du encapsulate the data {} into '', right
[07:01:42] <Cork> rethus: the problem was you tried to send json though www-form-urlencoded data
[07:01:51] <Cork> so the parser on the other side failed to parse it
[07:02:07] <rethus> Ok. thanks a lot Cork
[07:02:11] <Cork> www-form-urlencoded is the default encoding for posts
[07:54:30] <ufk_> hello
[08:04:24] <Pistos> How can I apply some code to given elements (selected with a jQuery selector) both at document load time, and at any time in the future when new elements are injected in the DOM?  (I swear I looked this up before, but for some reason can't find a solution on the web today.)
[08:05:45] <fabioportieri> Pistos: .delegate()
[08:06:29] <decx> Pistos use on. to watch a parent element, $('#mycontainer').on('event','.mydynamicelement',function(){])
[08:07:09] <decx> that replaces .live() from earlier versions
[08:07:29] <Pistos> fabioportieri: I'll check that out.
[08:07:42] <Pistos> decx: I was trying $('textarea').on('load', function() .... ); but it didn't seem to work at all.
[08:07:57] <Pistos> I want to set some data attributes for any textarea loaded.
[08:08:02] <decx> you bind the event to textarea
[08:08:13] <decx> but if you inject a new one that's not the same anymore
[08:08:31] <Pistos> decx: Exactly, I want to apply it to even ones that are injected.
[08:08:39] <decx> $('#textareaparent').on('load','textarea',function(){})
[08:08:40] <Pistos> Anyway, delegate looks like it might do what I want.
[08:08:55] <Pistos> decx: textarea parents can and will differ throughout the app
[08:09:11] <decx> now you're watching the parent for newly created textareas
[08:09:32] <Cork> decx: delegate is what replaced live
[08:09:46] <Cork> on is a new combination function that handles both delegate and bind
[08:09:58] <Cork> Pistos: and yes on and delegate can be the exact same thng
[08:10:01] <Pistos> Cork: I want to use .on, but I want to do it for a load or render event.
[08:10:07] <Cork> depending on the syntax you use for on
[08:10:13] <Pistos> I tried on('load',...) and it didn't fire at all.
[08:10:18] <decx> i find it confusing because event, selector is switched Cork ;)
[08:10:46] <Cork> decx: the attribute order was changed in on to make it closer to bind
[08:11:10] <Cork> Pistos: on is fired when content in replaced elements are loaded
[08:11:39] <Cork> it isn't fired for anything beside: script, iframe, img, object, embed
[08:11:54] <Cork> *fired on anything
[08:12:44] <Cork> Pistos: so if you append things to the dom it won't work
[08:13:24] <Pistos> I'd be really surprised if this weren't possible with jQuery.  I'm surely not the first person in history to want to do somethnig like this.
[08:13:42] <Pistos> "any time a foo element gets into the DOM, do function { ...}"
[08:13:46] <Cork> Pistos: you can fake the load event
[08:13:51] <Pistos> Sure, whatever it takes.
[08:13:54] <Cork> but there isn't a native browser event
[08:14:05] <Pistos> I'm happy to fire a fake event at the end of document load.
[08:14:17] <Cork> ok so when something that modifies the said content is ran run $('target').trigger('load')
[08:14:22] <Cork> then you can get a load event
[08:14:31] <Cork> but the browser won't help you
[08:14:39] <Pistos> Well, I don't want to have to visit every place in the code that could inject textareas.
[08:14:51] <decx> is there any reason to use delegate over on in 1.7+ ?
[08:15:06] <Cork> decx: if you want backwards compatibility
[08:15:08] <Cork> but nothing else
[08:15:15] <decx> good
[08:15:15] <Cork> possibly cause of readability
[08:15:31] <Cork> decx: delegate and bind is just small wrapper functions around on now days
[08:15:40] <Cork> (one liners)
[08:15:52] <decx> yeah, that's what i gathered
[08:16:09] <Cork> Pistos: why do you need load events on each textarea?
[08:16:33] <Cork> decx: but i would argue it is easier to read code that uses bind and delegate
[08:16:40] <Cork> rather then on with and without delegate syntax
[08:16:58] <Cork> especially if you use multiple events in the event string
[08:17:27] <Cork> and on is a REAL PAIN for new users
[08:17:42] <Cork> or users that used live before
[08:18:14] <decx> yeah it can be confusing at first
[08:18:28] <Cork> it's a bad api
[08:18:36] <Cork> its too overloaded
[08:18:37] <decx> (parent).watch('stuff that is happening', 'here', dostuff())
[08:18:39] <decx> ;)
[08:18:39] <Pistos> Cork: Well, the higher-level/particular problem I'm solving is that Chrome (and other browsers perhaps, I haven't tested yet) used to trigger a mousedown on the resize handle of textareas.  But lately, it stopped doing that, some time in the last year or so.
[08:19:05] <Pistos> I hooked onto that mousedown to basically disable textarea autoresizing.  i.e. if you manually resize, stop auto resizing.
[08:19:18] <Pistos> But now since the mousedown is not fired any more, that "feature" is broken.
[08:19:23] <Pistos> I'm trying to repair or recreate the feature.
[08:19:30] <Cork> Pistos: why not just remove the resize support?
[08:19:35] <Cork> it's a simple css pref
[08:19:44] <Pistos> Cork: Some people want it, some people don't, so I need to support both.
[08:19:48] <Pistos> need/would like
[08:19:55] <Cork> Pistos: so set a class on body
[08:19:56] <decx> most people don't even know about it
[08:20:06] <Pistos> Cork: I don't follow.
[08:20:08] <Cork> .noresite textarea {}
[08:20:25] <Cork> $(document.body).addClass('noresize')
[08:20:28] <Pistos> I don't understand.
[08:20:37] <Pistos> I _want_ to have the resize available to people.
[08:20:44] <Pistos> The ideal behaviour is this:
[08:21:09] <Pistos> Autoresize everything with this jQuery plugin, but if anyone manually resizes a textarea with their browser feature, then stop trying to autosize that particular textarea.
[08:21:23] <Pistos> Like I said, some of my users prefer auto, some prefer manual.
[08:22:13] <Pistos> It's bewildering to me why the Chrome devs would stop firing mousedown on the resizer handle.
[08:22:36] <Pistos> I tried to put a hook on ('form *') and nothing fires the mousedown when you mousedown on the handle.
[08:22:39] <BillCriswell> Emulation in Chrome is driving me nuts.  The tabs keep disappearing on my now that it's all in the console.
[08:22:39] <Pistos> That's kind of stupid.
[08:23:18] <Cork> Pistos: one min
[08:23:20] <decx> BillCriswell i had to search for 5 minutes before i found the new emulation area
[08:23:50] <Pistos> An alternate way to do this is if I could somehow detect a mouse drag.
[08:24:03] <Pistos> That doesn't seem possible other than the classic way of using mousedown and mouseup with the cursor coordinates.
[08:24:35] <decx> Pistos found on stack http://jsfiddle.net/vol7ron/Z7HDn/
[08:24:45] <BillCriswell> decx: It's driving me nuts
[08:25:23] <Cork> Pistos: this is what i mean http://jsfiddle.net/pcgVb/
[08:27:26] <Pistos> Cork: That isn't what I want though, unless I understand how you intend this to be used.
[08:27:31] <Pistos> Why would I ever want to disable the manual resize?
[08:27:42] <Pistos> I want to disable the auto resize.  And only under certain conditions.
[08:27:50] <Pistos> Anyway, I think I have found a workaround in this code.
[08:27:52] <Cork> auto resize?
[08:28:01] <Pistos> THere may actually be a function that is called when textareas are loaded.
[08:28:05] <Pistos> (existing in the code already)
[08:28:07] <Pistos> Yes, auto.  :)
[08:28:22] <Pistos> (via a jQuery plugin)
[08:28:25] <Cork> ah
[08:28:29] <Cork> not i follow
[08:28:32] <Pistos> *unless I don't understand
[08:28:33] <Cork> *now
[08:28:36] <decx> resizable in jq ui does that
[08:29:58] <Cork> well wouldn't the best approach be to just disable that part in the default solution
[08:30:07] <Cork> and then just provide a way to trigger it when you want it?
[08:30:31] <Cork> sounds like something you might want to do more then just on page load
[08:33:25] <ShawnRisk> how do I show an attribute tag like artist="Lady Gaga" when I click a link?  The text showing would say Lady Gaga.
[08:33:56] <Cork> show it?
[08:34:01] <Cork> you mean like a title="" ?
[08:34:13] <Cork> ShawnRisk: attributes isn't tags
[08:34:32] <Cork> attributes exist on tags, and isn't normally visible
[08:34:34] <ShawnRisk> yes I know I was writing too fast
[08:34:43] <ShawnRisk> Yes like title=""
[08:34:56] <Cork> so replace artist with title
[08:35:01] <BillCriswell> What do you mean by "show"?
[08:35:35] <BillCriswell> Also, should probably be using data-artist="Lady Gaga"
[08:35:39] <ShawnRisk> If I click a link, I want to have Lady Gaga show somewhere on the page.
[08:35:55] <Cork> heh
[08:36:10] <Cork> ShawnRisk: that was VERY vague...
[08:36:26] <ShawnRisk> okay let me say this in a different way
[08:36:35] <Cork> and ya data-artist, not use made up attributes without data-
[08:36:47] <Cork> (ever)
[08:36:48] <BillCriswell> $('a[data-artist]').on('click', function(){ $('.someEl').text($(this).data('artist')); });
[08:36:55] <snover> <a href="lady-gaga.html">click here for lady gaga</a>
[08:37:07] <Cork> :D
[08:37:17] <Cork> snover++ ^^'
[08:37:48] <BillCriswell> Would actually need a event.preventDefault(); up in there.
[08:37:55] <BillCriswell> Friggin <a>.
[08:37:57] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: let me try that
[08:38:23] <BillCriswell> $('a[data-artist]').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('.someEl').text($(this).data('artist')); }); would actually be what you need.
[08:38:38] <Pistos> Okay, I almost have it...
[08:38:39] <Cork> BillCriswell: why not delegate the event handler when your on it
[08:38:57] <Pistos> the final piece is that mouseup is not triggered if you drag the handle, and let go with the mouse cursor outside the textarea.  :(
[08:38:59] * Pistos sighs
[08:39:02] <BillCriswell> Cork: Say whaatttt
[08:39:24] <Cork> BillCriswell: $(document).on('click', 'a[data-artist]', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('.someEl').text($(this).data('artist')); })
[08:39:33] <x-finite> http://jsfiddle.net/2WMXt/1/ .. no matter what value I set for days parameter, it forgets the user choice
[08:40:11] <BillCriswell> Cork: I didn't know they were working with dynamic html.
[08:40:16] <BillCriswell> or do you just do that no matter what?
[08:40:31] <Cork> BillCriswell: its just a selector
[08:40:40] <Cork> as long as it can match an element it works
[08:41:02] <Cork> BillCriswell: and if you delegate it you get one event handler instead for 1*number of elements it matches
[08:41:58] <BillCriswell> Cork: So you always use event delegation?
[08:42:03] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: your code worked out great thanks
[08:42:11] <ShawnRisk> Sorry for the confusion everyone
[08:42:16] <Cork> BillCriswell: no, not if i ever only have one element i want to match
[08:43:08] <Cork> BillCriswell: but yes i often use delegation
[08:43:17] <BillCriswell> Cork: Got it. I guess I never worked on something large enough where I'd have to worry about a lot of event listeners on elements.
[08:43:18] <decx> var vs traverse, what's better in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/ECkeC/ ?
[08:44:02] <Cork> decx: the second isn't traverse
[08:44:05] <Cork> it is chaining
[08:44:09] <decx> right
[08:44:09] <BillCriswell> Well, event listeners on a lot of elements.
[08:44:19] <Cork> decx: and there isn't really any difference
[08:44:23] <decx> jsperf says it's the same as well
[08:44:35] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: what if I have multiple data- attributes should I just copy the $('#mtitle').text($(this).data('artist')); line or can I do $('#mtitle').text($(this).data('artist', 'title')); or something else?
[08:44:44] <Cork> decx: only difference is one uses a local variable name more
[08:44:57] <Cork> but for the engine it is the same thing
[08:45:36] <Cork> decx: one thing though i sincerely H-A-T-E .end()
[08:45:40] <decx> so if i dont have to access for example myparent.data inside the chain it doesnt matter
[08:45:40] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: You would need to do .text( $(this).data('artist') + ' ' + $(this).data('title') ); essentially.
[08:46:05] <BillCriswell> You'd want to cache $(this) in a variable at this point since you're using it more than one.
[08:46:11] <Cork> decx: as it is the reason jquery has a memory leak
[08:46:21] <decx> oh?
[08:46:40] <BillCriswell> Yeah, Cork taught me .end is a jerk.
[08:46:52] <decx> well i stick to vars then ;)
[08:47:48] <Cork> decx: to make end() work jquery needs to build a stack of all your earlier match sets
[08:47:49] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: thanks again that worked
[08:47:51] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell++
[08:48:13] <Cork> decx: so if you ever store a jquery selection where you have filtered a bigger set
[08:48:26] <Cork> you will leak all the elements matched in the earlier set
[08:48:42] <decx> good to know thanks
[08:49:02] <Cork> well i wrote a small live patch i use for my sites that kills the stack
[08:49:07] <Cork> and removed .end()
[08:49:11] <Cork> *removes
[08:49:30] <BillCriswell> Do you run into issues after removing end?
[08:49:42] <BillCriswell> I feel like I may have seen that used a lot in jQuery UI
[08:49:54] <Cork> BillCriswell: jquery ui depends heavily on it
[08:50:02] <Cork> but i don't use it much
[08:50:13] <Cork> but ya i have to patch a few of it's functions too
[08:50:48] <Cork> but to be sure that anyone coding on the site can't unintentionally leak dom elements is worth the work
[08:52:06] <BillCriswell> You could avoid .end() issues with certain types of selectors though, right?
[08:52:16] <duch_kazatel> goooooooood morning folks
[08:52:19] <Cork> $('*').filter('#elm1, #elm2').filter('#elm1').prevObject.prevObject (full set again)
[08:52:36] <BillCriswell> Ay yoooooooooo duch_kazatel
[08:52:36] <Cork> BillCriswell: you never really need .end()
[08:52:48] <BillCriswell> I've never used it I don't think haha.
[08:52:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: well except for unwrap
[08:53:17] <Cork> end, unwarp and fadeTo depends n it
[08:53:27] <Cork> *on it
[08:54:24] <Cork> BillCriswell: but to make it clear, it isn't end that leaks
[08:54:34] <Cork> it is anything that reduces the match sets
[08:54:43] <Cork> (just so end could revert it)
[08:56:42] <BillCriswell> Yeah, $('li').eq(5) would keep all lis, $('li:eq(5)') wouldn't.
[08:56:49] <BillCriswell> Thinking about that right?
[08:57:06] <Cork> not sure actually
[08:57:16] <Cork> as .eq in there runs .eq in the background
[08:57:25] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/unOguVOv/1/edit?html,js,output is what I was looking at.
[09:00:03] <Cork> BillCriswell: interesting
[09:00:20] <Cork> so there is an argument for the : selectors even though they are slow like crap
[09:01:47] <Cork> BillCriswell: updated version btw http://jsbin.com/unOguVOv/2/edit
[09:05:47] <ShawnRisk> I want an effect to happen when the page loads and I am at the top of the page.  Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/fKbVyQzg and the else if doesn't pulsate.  Any ideas on how to fix this?
[09:06:50] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk try console.log( $(this) ); and see what it is.
[09:07:36] <Cork> duch_kazatel: it's window
[09:07:41] <ShawnRisk> yes
[09:07:47] <Cork> ShawnRisk: the scroll event isn't fired on page load
[09:07:56] <duch_kazatel> (cork that's what i was going to get at)
[09:08:19] <ShawnRisk> I know that but even when I scroll down and scroll back up the pulsate doesn't happen
[09:08:49] <Cork> ShawnRisk: what does scrollTop() return?
[09:12:03] <Pistos> Cork, decx, et al: Thanks for your assistance earlier.  I managed to work around the issue.
[09:12:48] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I am not sure at all.  All this splits out in console is lines of codes without numbers
[09:13:18] <Cork> ShawnRisk: just run console.log($(this).scrollTop()) before the first if statement
[09:13:32] <Cork> should be quite clear what it returns from that
[09:15:04] <ShawnRisk> Cork: maybe I did something wrong in my code when I tried that.  When I scroll down and back up, it says 0
[09:15:43] <Cork> ShawnRisk: suspected that
[09:15:44] <ShawnRisk> I think I get it
[09:15:53] <Cork> btw the statements is flawed
[09:16:02] <Cork> if num < 0 do x
[09:16:04] <Cork> opps
[09:16:08] <Cork> if num < 20 do x
[09:16:09] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:16:19] <Cork> if num isn't < 20 but is 0 ?!?
[09:16:39] <ShawnRisk> Yes I know I just figured that out
[09:16:48] <ShawnRisk> I got this to work out
[09:16:51] <ShawnRisk> thanks for the help
[09:16:54] <Cork> np
[09:18:28] <ShawnRisk> As for the other part of the question, what if I am at the top of the page already?  I don't want this to pulsate when the loads all the time just when at the top of the page.
[09:19:15] <Cork> ShawnRisk: if you don't want it to pulsate on load it should work as is
[09:20:57] <ShawnRisk> Cork: only if you are at the top of the page, not on load if you are half way down the page.  Also right now the code will only pulsate now. if you scroll down and back up.
[09:21:31] <Cork> ShawnRisk: you can't be down the page on page load
[09:21:42] <Cork> as the dom isn't drawn yet
[09:21:51] <duch_kazatel> not by default at least.  you can force the user "down" the page after the dom has been drawn and layed out.
[09:22:02] <Cork> sorry on dom ready
[09:22:04] <Cork> on load you can
[09:23:21] <ShawnRisk> I mean once the page is fully loaded.
[09:23:37] <Cork> well you could wait for the onload event
[09:23:50] <Cork> and then check the scrollTop and do the animation if it is 0
[09:31:05] <ShawnRisk> Cork: thanks
[09:31:11] <ShawnRisk> I am off for lunch now
[09:49:02] <nik_jv> Hi guys anyone here has any better options than using full calendar to build a calendar widget with drag and drop ?
[09:49:04] <nik_jv> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[09:54:21] <duch_kazatel> nik_jv not sure what your question means.
[09:54:25] <decx> that's a pretty sweet plugin, much better than that ugly table with droppables a programmer friend made for a cinema backend
[09:55:04] <decx> oh it's built on jq ui
[09:55:07] <decx> meh :>
[09:55:10] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[10:06:32] <decx> is it advisable to put event handlers inside an if statement? http://jsfiddle.net/ncJ8R/
[10:06:40] <nik_jv> duch_kazatel:I am using angular JS and i found this http://angular-ui.github.io/
[10:07:45] <duch_kazatel> decx why would you do that?
[10:08:25] <decx> only bind something on a specific page
[10:08:58] <decx> but functions in if is not good i'm told and a handler is a function
[10:09:32] <duch_kazatel> decx correct.  i wouldn't bind like that personally.
[10:10:09] <duch_kazatel> instead change the behavior of the function itself.
[10:10:50] <decx> that makes sense thx
[10:10:52] <duch_kazatel> but that's me.
[10:12:59] <decx> what if i like to check if a function exists before calling it? in jqui for example: if (jQuery.isFunction(jQuery.fn.autocomplete)){ $( "#search" ).autocomplete({
[10:13:23] <duch_kazatel> imo you should know if the function is defined.
[10:13:27] <duch_kazatel> but that's me.
[10:13:55] <decx> that would be best
[10:14:12] <decx> but i often have to deal with sites where there are 5000 different jquery plugins cramped in
[10:14:14] <decx> :>
[10:14:15] <BillCriswell> decx: jQuery.fn.autocomplete would return undefined if it doesn't exist, so the isFunction call might be a bit overkill
[10:15:17] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah... that's still dirty.  soudns like you need some level of package management that bundles your plugins/scripts/etc together based on what you're actually using.
[10:17:27] <pfac> ping
[10:17:32] <BillCriswell> pang
[10:17:42] <pfac> hey there's life :)
[10:17:57] <pfac> need help with what I think it's a bug in jquery
[10:18:10] <pfac> but I'm not sure, therefore I ask first :)
[10:18:44] <pfac> so, should I just keep on writing? :P
[10:19:29] <duch_kazatel> pfac supply a test case in jsfiddle.
[10:19:38] <duch_kazatel> pfac because otherwise nobody will know wtf you're talking about :)
[10:19:59] <d8bhatta> Hello Guys
[10:20:05] <pfac> http://jsfiddle.net/pfac/4s387/
[10:20:25] <duch_kazatel> pfac okay, wjhat's the bug?
[10:20:32] <pfac> I tried performing an ajax call to a non-existent resource
[10:20:46] <pfac> and I got 404, and the callback registered with fail() was triggered
[10:20:51] <duch_kazatel> right.
[10:20:53] <duch_kazatel> that's intended.
[10:20:55] <pfac> but once I changed the dataType to script
[10:20:59] <pfac> nothing happens
[10:21:02] <pfac> I get the 404
[10:21:05] <pfac> but no trigger
[10:21:07] <shoky> Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and cross-domain JSONP requests.
[10:21:09] <Cypherous> Hiya, having a small issue with jquery playing up
[10:21:16] <shoky> `api ajax
[10:21:16] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[10:21:20] <shoky> ;\
[10:21:23] <duch_kazatel> ^^ intended behavior.
[10:21:42] <Cypherous> I'm the .tooltip() stuff from jquery UI which yesterday worked great, today its not working at all
[10:21:57] <d8bhatta> can somebody suggest me jquery slider with following features
[10:21:58] <d8bhatta> 1. side arrow s for navigation
[10:21:58] <d8bhatta> 2. Number of sliders = number of circle down so that when we click the circle respected slider gets displayed
[10:21:58] <d8bhatta> 3. Play  and pause featre
[10:22:25] <BillCriswell> d8bhatta: Almost all of them.
[10:22:26] <d8bhatta> I can find so many sliders with 1 and 2 feature but could not even single one with all those three features
[10:22:27] <pfac> @duch_kazatel really? then how can I verify if the request to load a particular script ended up with 404? There might be an error in the url
[10:22:41] <Cypherous> More specifically, http://i.imgur.com/wINw7DY.png now displays as http://i.imgur.com/hPhB9KC.png
[10:22:48] <duch_kazatel> pfac did you look at what shoky said?
[10:23:03] <pfac> yes, but how can I work around it?
[10:23:09] <d8bhatta> BillCriswell: yes...I need such slider
[10:23:15] <duch_kazatel> pfac by using a valid URL?
[10:23:21] <jphase> d8bhatta: nivo is free and configurable, but BillCriswell is right, most of them have those features
[10:23:44] <d8bhatta> jphase: let me check i tout
[10:23:48] <d8bhatta> tx
[10:24:15] <pfac> I ended up seeing this because I was trying to force the ajax call to fail
[10:24:27] <pfac> so I could test if my callbacks were being triggered
[10:24:42] <pfac> I need to support cross-site requests
[10:24:58] <duch_kazatel> pfac sounds like $.ajax() doesn't do what you want then?  not sure what to tell you.
[10:24:58] <shoky> a script tag is not an ajax request
[10:25:16] <duch_kazatel> if you're loading it via $.ajax() it is.
[10:25:27] <d8bhatta> jphase: any link you can provide..nothing useful i got
[10:25:29] <shoky> it is?
[10:25:53] <jphase> d8bhatta: http://dev7studios.com/plugins/nivo-slider/    (first link when googling "nivo")
[10:25:57] <duch_kazatel> apparently.  why not write in a script tag?
[10:26:18] <d8bhatta> i searched BillCriswell as you said its right now
[10:26:19] <d8bhatta> one
[10:26:47] <jphase> ?
[10:26:51] <pfac> long story, but I need to perform some logic in order to decide if the script is going to be loaded, to prevent some failures
[10:27:01] <BillCriswell> I get lost in here so quickly.
[10:27:11] <jphase> BillCriswell: I think you just got googled hehe
[10:27:19] <shoky> o right it is
[10:27:53] <shoky> hm then why isn't there an error handler
[10:28:10] <BillCriswell> I love that my twitter avatar thingie shows up when you google my name: https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000859748423/8WX0oIgH.jpeg
[10:28:17] <duch_kazatel> I'd use something like this instead: http://css-tricks.com/thinking-async/
[10:30:03] <pfac> @duch_kazatel don't get it. This is all done asynchronously, the problem here is detecting it failed to load :P
[10:30:42] <duch_kazatel> pfac i guess i don't understand why you're injecting bad script tags in the first place - trying to see when that would happen.
[10:30:46] <Cypherous> So nobody got any ideas why it would suddenly stop working?
[10:31:02] <duch_kazatel> Cypherous are you getting any console errors?
[10:33:01] <pfac> what do you mean injecting bad script tags?
[10:33:16] <duch_kazatel> why would a script tag fail to load?
[10:33:34] <shoky> hm so i was right, even using $.ajax  dataType:'script'  isn't a real ajax request
[10:33:41] <duch_kazatel> hah, figures.
[10:33:44] <Cypherous> duch_kazatel, http://pastebin.com/Z2JUJCF9 those are the only things in the console relating to anything that isn't just an image get request etc
[10:33:52] <shoky> at least if its cross-domain
[10:34:02] <pfac> ok that explains a lot...
[10:34:02] <Cypherous> I've not modified the .js files after downloading them
[10:34:42] <pfac> ok then, I need to rethink this
[10:34:43] <Cypherous> Sorry for the formatting in that paste btw
[10:34:48] <pfac> ty for your help :)
[10:35:04] <Cork> shoky: depends what the crossDomain pref is
[10:35:26] <duch_kazatel> Cypherous whaaaa.  mind using firebug's console or chrome's console instead?  either way, SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list test.php:23 looks like an issue.
[10:35:29] <thomasgriffin> $(document).one('mouseout') works well except that it triggers when the users mouse hovers over the scrollbar. Any way to make this not happen? otherwise this works perfectly
[10:36:03] <Cypherous> Hmm thats just the default console in firefox, not sure how many more errors would be discovered by firebug
[10:36:14] <duch_kazatel> it's not more errors, it's more meaningful errors.
[10:36:29] <duch_kazatel> your issues are either a syntax problem in your code, or modified files.
[10:36:35] <Cypherous> Well give me a sec and i can install it
[10:36:35] <duch_kazatel> but those errors explain why things aren't working.
[10:36:48] <duch_kazatel> try to fix that error I just pointed out.
[10:36:48] <Cork> Cypherous: firebug is just a frontend for the built in debugging api
[10:36:54] <Cypherous> Well the syntax worked fine yesterday and the files are unmodified
[10:36:55] <Cork> Cypherous: so they see the same data
[10:37:12] <duch_kazatel> Cypherous things don't magically break like that.
[10:37:41] <duch_kazatel> something modified a file and broke something.
[10:38:14] <Cypherous> Hmmm line 23 isn't related to anything broken, odd
[10:38:37] <Cypherous> Gues si'll have to go look at it
[10:39:18] <shoky> Cork: hm right
[10:39:48] <Chepra> Hey. Having a list of items (coming from one item), how do i get the element which is a direct sibling to my current item?
[10:40:13] <duch_kazatel> parent > child
[10:40:21] <Cork> Chepra: siblings, previus sibling or next sibling?
[10:40:50] <Chepra> Ah. Dont call .siblings(), use .prev(), .next() directyl
[10:41:32] <Paladine> don't suppose someone could explain why .hide() is not working when I click on [X] here could they? http://jsfiddle.net/Awf6s/117/
[10:41:42] <Cypherous> duch_kazatel, well that syntax error is now gone but still not working
[10:42:38] <duch_kazatel> Cypherous you need to keep dumping through your own code - i don't have it in front of me so I don't know.
[10:42:41] <shoky> Paladine: because it's not in the DOM yet when you're adding the click handler to it
[10:43:10] <duch_kazatel> paladine check out using event delegation to handle this isntead.
[10:43:16] <Paladine> shoky, but it is, it gets added when the .test div is clicked
[10:43:31] <shoky> Paladine: which is much later than when you added the click handler
[10:43:31] <Paladine> duch, that is foreign to me lol I am not a coder, I am just trying to throw something together
[10:43:35] <duch_kazatel> Paladine do, it's not.
[10:43:50] <shoky> Paladine: you're adding the click handler on page load
[10:44:06] <duch_kazatel> $('parentSelector').on('click', 'childSelector', function(){});
[10:45:43] <Paladine> shoky, so how do I make it work? mean trying to fix this for liek an hour now
[10:45:48] <Paladine> been*
[10:45:58] <duch_kazatel> Paladine did you see what I just put in the channel?
[10:48:32] <duch_kazatel> Paladine also valid html is a good thing.
[10:48:39] <Cypherous> Well thanks for the help duch_kazatel, the issue was a missing ) but i was looking on the line it mentioned in my IDE which wasn't the same as the line it was actually referencing >.<
[10:48:40] <Paladine> duch, yes but it still doesn't make aw hole lot of sense to me sec
[10:49:02] <Paladine> this is what I changed it to based on what you wrote - http://jsfiddle.net/Awf6s/119/
[10:49:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Awf6s/120/
[10:49:50] <duch_kazatel> Paladine ^^ $("#info").on('click', "#close", function(){ is what you wanted.
[10:50:04] <Paladine> ok that makes sense now thanks
[10:50:04] <duch_kazatel> the first item must exist at pageload.
[10:50:32] <Paladine> so I should probably change the .test click function too
[10:50:43] <duch_kazatel> you can only bind event handlers to things that exist at the time of binding.  in your case, the element(s) in question weren't in the DOM yes.
[10:50:45] <duch_kazatel> *yet
[10:51:20] <Paladine> yeah I see what you are saying now
[10:51:25] <duch_kazatel> and that's up to you - I prefer .on() over .click(), since .click() is just a convenience method for .on('click'
[10:51:43] <Paladine> yeah I would rather have consistancy so I will change it, thanks for the help
[10:52:08] <duch_kazatel> mmk.  keep in mind that you can replace your other .click()'s with .on('click', function(){});
[10:52:13] <duch_kazatel> no need for that second arg in .click.
[10:54:21] <Paladine> ok so it will automatically look for an <a> if nothing else is specified, thanks
[10:54:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:54:35] <Paladine> damn I guess I better go cook dinner now lol
[10:54:38] <duch_kazatel> no, it won't.
[10:54:47] <duch_kazatel> you need to read up on event binding.
[10:55:26] <Paladine> I need to read up on a lot of things, if on;y time were so available to do it lol, but I will try to make some, for now I have enough to move forward, so thanks again for the help
[10:55:41] <duch_kazatel> what you just said is not at all what .on('
[10:55:50] <duch_kazatel> .on('click', function(){}); does
[10:56:00] <duch_kazatel> but good luck either way.
[11:07:58] <decx> is find always faster than children? and what's the point of children if find is faster even with find child ( http://jsperf.com/findvschildren/2 )
[11:09:55] <duch_kazatel> decx one goes one level, the other many levels
[11:10:04] <duch_kazatel> it depends on your needs.
[11:10:32] <decx> yeah i found this simple test when i wanted to check myself and added the last inverted test which surprised me
[11:10:50] <decx> probably depends on how many elements there are
[11:10:56] <duch_kazatel> That's part of it, yeah.
[11:10:59] <duch_kazatel> and use case, etc.
[11:11:18] <duch_kazatel> "don't prematurely optimize" and all that.
[11:33:26] <BillCriswell> Has anyone ever seen a useful accordion?
[11:33:45] <BillCriswell> Just realizing how popular these things are and I can't find one case I find useful.
[11:41:41] <Neri> Hey guys, quick question, any help would be greatly appreciated. I've built a simple image gallery using PHP/JQuery where image URIs are pulled from a MySQL DB. When a user clicks the 'main' image, it's then displayed larger in a modal window. I'm using a POST to send the current clicked image URI to the modal window. My question is: Do I need to be doing any sanitization or data validation after the POST from the main page to the modal window? If so, what
[11:41:41] <Neri> would you suggest? Thanks.
[12:00:44] <blakespot> do
[12:00:48] <blakespot> er... so,
[12:00:53] <blakespot>     $('#e_apEEEEEpBullet').removeClass("currentPos");
[12:01:24] <blakespot> if #e_apEEEEEpBullet does not exist, that statement does not cause an error
[12:01:30] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:01:32] <duch_kazatel> it tests for you.
[12:01:35] <blakespot> jQ does not gripe about actions on things that do not exist?
[12:01:38] <blakespot> auto test
[12:01:41] <blakespot> ok
[12:01:42] <duch_kazatel> yup
[12:01:54] <blakespot> that short cuts me on this piece a bit - nice
[12:02:20] <Cork> well it doesn't really test if it exists
[12:02:28] <Cork> it is just written in a way where it doesn't matter
[12:02:34] <duch_kazatel> true
[12:04:05] <thomasgriffin> is there any way to target the enter window, including the scrollbar in jQuery?
[12:04:26] <thomasgriffin> window, document, 'html' do not include the scrollbar on Windows machines
[12:04:31] <Cork> no
[12:04:40] <Cork> jquery can't do something native js can't
[12:04:52] <decx> you can do your own scrollbar, with blackjack and hookers
[12:04:56] <Cork> and window is the top most element webcontent can access
[12:05:01] <waiiirc_> $('#e_apEEEEEpBullet') returns an array-like object, removeClass("currentPos") simply acts on that array, therefore it is not an error to act on an empty array
[12:05:40] <thomasgriffin> well that sucks
[12:05:53] <duch_kazatel> what's the problem you're having?
[12:06:07] <Cork> thomasgriffin: web content is untrusted code
[12:06:17] <Cork> and it has to be
[12:07:29] <thomasgriffin> see here: http://thomasgriffinmedia.com - the idea is that i do not want the popup to appear if someone simply wants to scroll down the page
[12:08:02] <thomasgriffin> only when they truly leave the browsing window, but i can't do that reliably if the window/body/html space is confined inside of the scrollbar
[12:08:31] <thomasgriffin> using $('html').one('mouseleave') works on OS X because the scrollbars work differently
[12:08:45] <NoiseEee> ouch.
[12:08:45] <thomasgriffin> but that does not work on Windows machines (minus Firefox, where it oddly works there)
[12:08:55] <NoiseEee> why would you bind to <html> ???
[12:09:09] <duch_kazatel> wait when does this popup open?
[12:09:14] <Cork> thomasgriffin: you could do something like html { overflow: hidden; } body { overflow:auto }
[12:09:30] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee because window and document are confined inside the scrollbar
[12:09:35] <Cork> or add a second div inside body if you need it
[12:09:41] <thomasgriffin> at least using HTML i can provide the proper experience in OS X
[12:09:47] <thomasgriffin> err $('html')
[12:10:04] <Cork> so it's not hard to handle
[12:11:08] <thomasgriffin> Cork i can't go about changing the layout because other people use it
[12:11:11] <thomasgriffin> not just me
[12:11:39] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: when does that popup appear?  seems like after a delay
[12:11:49] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee when you leave the page
[12:11:55] <thomasgriffin> when your mouse exits the window
[12:12:03] <duch_kazatel> why would you do it that way?
[12:12:14] <NoiseEee> a) that is def. super annoying ^^
[12:12:19] <duch_kazatel> agreed.
[12:12:24] <thomasgriffin> duch_kazatel because the conversion rates are on it are so much higher than traditional :-)
[12:12:25] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: but your goal is not to have that happen if the user has crolled?
[12:12:42] <duch_kazatel> imo do it after a set time once and never show it again.
[12:13:21] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee no, the intention is to not show it until the user is actually leaving your site
[12:13:35] <thomasgriffin> so that it doesnt appear while they are using your site
[12:13:51] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: why not use something a little nicer / somewhat similar, onpageunload?
[12:13:52] <thomasgriffin> duch_kazatel it works that way - once closed, it doesnt appear again
[12:14:26] <duch_kazatel> but you're wanting to interrupt my workflow of "not interested".  but okay.
[12:14:48] <thomasgriffin> duch_kazatel you are making an assumption that is not necessarily true
[12:14:56] <duch_kazatel> check out onpageunload instead.
[12:15:06] <NoiseEee> you're wanting to interrupt my 'hey let me check that sports score again'
[12:15:10] <NoiseEee> which is bullshit, quite frankly
[12:15:21] <NoiseEee> do it when the user is trying to take the tab to a new URL, or close it.
[12:16:42] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee the numbers speak for themselves - conversions are higher with exit intent vs traditional popups
[12:16:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah, interrupting my expectations like that seems awfully intrusive.
[12:17:15] <duch_kazatel> do you ever show them whatever that information is elsehwere on the site?
[12:17:22] <duch_kazatel> (I didn't look at the contents of the popup)
[12:17:44] <thomasgriffin> duch_kazatel it is targeted based on where they are in the site
[12:17:58] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: and i'm saying redefine your "exit intent" to mean loading a new page in the tab / closing the tab
[12:18:05] <thomasgriffin> so the popups are contextually relevant
[12:18:40] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: for me, if i were to simply switch tabs to get an update on the Leafs game and then have your tab prevent me from taking focus, i'd definetely never visit your site again
[12:18:56] <NoiseEee> but hey, SEOs gonna SEO i guess
[12:19:09] <duch_kazatel> or if your tab changed its content like that.
[12:19:18] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee - thats fine - you probably wouldn't subscribe anyways, right?
[12:19:20] <NoiseEee> conversions gonna convert
[12:19:34] <duch_kazatel> i feel like your data might not be 100% accurate.  is the content of the popups ever presented anywhere else on the given page?
[12:19:36] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: i might, but i'd be so offended by your "WAIT LOOK AT ME" attitude
[12:20:02] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: its rude.  let me put my eyes where i want.  onbeforeunload() does exactly what you want in the not-rude way.
[12:20:57] <thomasgriffin> http://bounceexchange.com/
[12:21:30] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee - statistically, once you leave, you are likely never coming back anyways - it has to be a priority for me to do what I can to engage people
[12:21:40] <NoiseEee> engaging is not the same as forcing a LOOKITME
[12:21:52] <NoiseEee> anyways, do what you want i guess, but you are the bane of developers and consumers
[12:22:14] <synth_> is there a way to detect when a input field's text has changed while the user is typing? it looks like .change() only fires when the user focuses outside of the input rather than while they are typing
[12:22:28] <thomasgriffin> NoiseEee we can agree to disagree :-)
[12:22:32] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: and onbeforeunload() fires before the user leaves.
[12:23:12] <decx> but for the popup to be effective you'd have to block the exit, which is imho more rude than just popping a popup on out-of-focus
[12:23:14] <Velveeta> if you're trying to prevent them from leaving before they see your ad, that's what onbeforeunload does.. you seem to want to prevent them from even focusing on anything except your page, even if they were going to another window to work on an excel spreadsheet for a while or something
[12:23:17] <duch_kazatel> that sort of behavior is exactly the kind of stuff that'll get you penalized in the long run btw.  google is getting better about detecting when sites are trying to interrupt the expectations of end users, javascript included.
[12:23:36] <NoiseEee> Velveeta: yep
[12:23:46] <NoiseEee> so beyond rude
[12:23:57] <NoiseEee> all in the name of "conversions' though
[12:24:13] <Velveeta> capitalism at its finest
[12:24:24] <decx> ye conversions know no ethics
[12:24:39] <duch_kazatel> and will eventually give you the opposite of what you want.  this is what pisses me off about grey-hat SEO strategy.  curate greate content and let users do as they expect.  Otherwise, let them be.
[12:24:42] <NoiseEee> put em in the same camp as those SEO wunderkinds
[12:24:48] <m6> synth_: see answers in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1443292/how-to-implement-onchange-of-input-type-text-with-jquery
[12:25:07] <NoiseEee> "how can i engage users without me trying to engage them with content"
[12:25:10] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: that's my philosophy also… if you publish it, they will come
[12:25:15] <thomasgriffin> there is no SEO about any of this? I don't quite understand why that is being brought up?
[12:25:16] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[12:25:27] <NoiseEee> thomasgriffin: because its reeks of the same ilk/drive
[12:25:53] <NoiseEee> "fuck the user, i want to force them to do something i want to do, despite what they expect"
[12:25:56] <thomasgriffin> all of this is loaded asynchronously after the page loads - so it's not like I'm hiding content for SEO
[12:25:58] <duch_kazatel> thomasgriffin you're engaging in the kind of behavior that is hostile to end users.
[12:26:08] <Velveeta> they're saying it's akin to the old strategies of keyword stuffing and google adword hijacking, anything to get your sales pitch in front of the customer
[12:26:09] <duch_kazatel> no, but you're going against the end-user's wishes.
[12:26:19] <synth_> nevermind, answered my own question. .change() only fires when the input loses focus. $("#input_id").bind("input", function(){}); worked for firing while a user types.
[12:26:20] <NoiseEee> "HOW BOUT A BURGER?"
[12:26:24] <NoiseEee> "HOW BOUT FRIES?"
[12:26:47] <NoiseEee> synth_: might want to check the browser compat of that
[12:26:47] <Velveeta> would you like to try our new "MEGA..BIGASS FRIES"
[12:27:23] <synth_> NoiseEee this is for an internal intranet page, i believe all users use firefox or chrome
[12:27:25] <Velveeta> Carl's Jr. does not wish for any child to go hungry.. You are an unfit mother.. Please stand by while we alert the authorities.. Your children will be placed in the custody of Carl's Jr.
[12:27:27] <NoiseEee> synth_: sweet :)
[12:27:28] <duch_kazatel> don't interrupt userflow.  if I want to leave your site, I want to leave your site.  if, suddenly, you're getting better "conversions" through a popup like that, something tells me you should take a look at the way your side is setup.
[12:27:32] <synth_> i'll double check though
[12:27:50] <duch_kazatel> because your "message" isn't getting through clearly the first time
[12:27:54] <NoiseEee> synth_: yeah i just looked, seems kosher. funny how i wasnt even aware of that event until last month
[12:28:18] <synth_> haha yeah i'm trying to get a function put together to allow us to easily search our contacts page for users
[12:28:19] <Velveeta> i've never heard of the input event
[12:28:57] <duch_kazatel> woah there's an input event?
[12:29:02] <synth_> yep
[12:29:06] <duch_kazatel> welp.
[12:29:12] <Velveeta> it's like the change event, but fires without having to blur
[12:29:15] <Velveeta> neato
[12:29:20] <decx> i learned that yesterday on my autosuggest :>
[12:29:27] <synth_> how do you access the text of an input?
[12:29:28] <duch_kazatel> http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1732157/mind-blown-2.gif
[12:29:42] <Velveeta> i can start using that immediately in some places where i have debounced keypress events :D
[12:29:45] <duch_kazatel> $('input').val();
[12:30:22] <synth_> perfect
[12:30:33] <NoiseEee> i was wondering how angular did it, i guess the 'input' event :)
[12:30:34] <duch_kazatel> I know, I wrote it ;)
[12:30:36] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahaha
[12:30:38] <duch_kazatel> anyway
[12:30:56] <Velveeta> noiseeee: that and voodoo sorcery
[12:31:04] <synth_> http://i.imgur.com/VnozrvW.png proof
[12:31:09] <synth_> :D
[12:31:26] <duch_kazatel> llama
[12:32:16] <decx> so you're the other piwik user. there are dozens of us
[12:32:28] <Velveeta> lol
[12:32:28] <synth_> two dozen?
[12:32:35] <duch_kazatel> all 2 of you!
[12:32:37] <synth_> bakers dozen
[12:33:05] <duch_kazatel> http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/L4tvI.gif - lol programming
[12:33:08] <Velveeta> that reminds me of the time i was in one of my favorite bars, and went to order a newcastle, and they said they stopped carrying it on tap, and i was like "what?! but i always order a newcastle on tap!" and the owner was like "oh, so you're the one!"
[12:33:19] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[12:33:25] <synth_> haha
[12:33:29] <synth_> mm newcastle
[12:33:31] <Velveeta> oh man that gif cracked me up
[12:33:36] <duch_kazatel> now you can drink good beer!
[12:33:37] <duch_kazatel> jk brb
[12:33:45] <duch_kazatel> (seriously i'll be right back)
[12:34:05] <synth_> prefer teh sour beers
[12:35:01] <Velveeta> this is what that programmer thing made me think of too: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[12:35:18] <Velveeta> i'm not big on the sours
[12:35:33] <synth_> god that gif is me
[12:35:42] <Velveeta> that gif is pretty much everybody :D
[12:36:09] <synth_> it should say at the end, "fuck it, i'll use bootstrap"
[12:36:43] <decx> then it's the same gif with the markup for bootstrap
[12:36:54] <synth_> lol
[12:37:32] <synth_> is there a way to access just the plain text inside of a div? including all child divs inside?
[12:37:42] <decx> text()
[12:37:55] <synth_> so that inlcudes the text of all child divs too?
[12:38:05] <Voyage> hi
[12:38:06] <Voyage> http://jsfiddle.net/YN8sq/
[12:38:06] <synth_> thought i'd have to write a recursive function
[12:38:09] <decx> well now i'm not sure anymore
[12:38:11] <decx> :D
[12:38:14] <synth_> lol
[12:38:14] <Voyage> what can be wrong?
[12:39:01] <Velveeta> decx: i'm pretty sure you're right, text() itself should recurse the children
[12:39:17] <synth_> he is correct
[12:39:21] <synth_> :D
[12:39:33] <Velveeta> voyage: it depends on what you're trying to accomplish
[12:39:44] <Velveeta> we need more than just a fiddle link, we need an actual question too
[12:39:59] <Voyage> Velveeta,  just want all the check boxes to become check when the button is cliced
[12:40:03] <Voyage> clicked*
[12:40:06] <Velveeta> oh ok
[12:40:39] <decx> it really does? ... well that's it i'm out *george on seinfeld*.gif
[12:42:14] <Velveeta> voyage: weird, your click itself doesn't seem to be firing at all in that example, BUT, what you're looking for is $(selector).prop('checked', true)
[12:44:32] <Voyage> Velveeta,  http://jsfiddle.net/YN8sq/3/ not working
[12:44:57] <Velveeta> here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/Velveeta/YN8sq/4/
[12:45:10] <Velveeta> finally spotted why your id selector wasn't working, you had a hashtag in your actual id
[12:45:14] <synth_> SWEET. my live search is working
[12:45:22] <Velveeta> synth_: nice
[12:46:28] <decx> ah the good old hashtag in the html bug. so easy to overlook, "hmm let's check the ids. yep that's an id"
[12:46:37] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:47:33] <Voyage> Velveeta,  what was the issue?
[12:47:43] <Voyage> Velveeta,  oh. #. thx
[12:47:47] <Velveeta> no problemo
[12:53:52] <jch2os> I'm doing a json grab like, $.get(url, function(data) {} and then inside that function I doa for i in data.item so I can loop through the json data.  works if I output it to the console.  But if I try to load that into a database using a db.transaction(function(tx) { insert..blal blah blah} it will only insert the last "i", does that make sense?
[13:01:57] <jch2os> can anyone tell me why this gives me error code 5? http://pastebin.com/WgYdTZC0
[13:02:22] <jch2os> if I limit the json file that it is getting data from to 100 or less it works...
[13:02:42] <Velveeta> there's no jquery in that pastebin...
[13:03:06] <jch2os> velveeta - sorry I didn't post the $.get(url, function (data)
[13:03:07] <jch2os> at the top
[13:03:27] <jch2os> I'm using it in jquery mobile and trying to pull a json feed into a local sqlite database
[13:03:28] <Velveeta> but it would seem that the problem here isn't the $.get itself, since you're getting the data just fine
[13:03:39] <Velveeta> it's the sql you're trying to execute, right?
[13:04:03] <jch2os> Velveeta - I would agree..
[13:04:20] <Velveeta> that might be a question better suited to the sqlite people
[13:04:26] <Velveeta> i have no experience w/ that
[13:04:33] <jch2os> ok ;) thanks
[13:05:27] <jch2os> I bet I'm not escaping something
[13:06:28] <Velveeta> you could try running each of your variable concats through encodeURIComponent()
[13:06:44] <Velveeta> or just a regex to escape quotes from " to &quot;
[13:08:29] <jch2os> Velveeta - encodeURIComponent() seemed to work.  I limited it to just inserting the no first
[13:08:35] <jch2os> now I will add each back!  Thanks
[13:08:40] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[13:09:18] <jch2os> funny how it seems so simple when you type it :)
[13:10:52] <jch2os> everyone of them went in after I wrapped them in that encodeURIComponent()
[13:15:29] <Velveeta> woo hoo! jquery 1.11 is finally officially released! amd ALL the things!
[13:15:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah - we're excited for it here.
[13:16:13] <Velveeta> i've been waiting for the official unveiling before rolling it out in my own project
[13:17:02] <Velveeta> i manually went through a copy of jquery ui last week, and added amd wrappers to each component there so that our products would be able to include them individually, and so that i could pull just the core and factory portions into my own product
[13:19:44] <blakespot> hmm
[13:20:17] <blakespot> $("#e_choose").on('mouseover', function() { menuElem1.slideLeftShow(500); });
[13:20:43] <blakespot> $("#e_choose").on('mouseout', function() { menuElem1.slideLeftHide(500); });
[13:21:07] <blakespot> slideLeftShow is a simple this.animate
[13:21:44] <blakespot> yet when I roll on and then off the div, the animation fires sometimes more than once -- open close open -- on a rollover, say.
[13:21:49] <decx> fiddle us
[13:21:58] <blakespot> When I did this as an on-click toggle it was fine
[13:21:59] <blakespot> ok
[13:22:37] <duch_kazatel> you want mouseenter as the "in" even, not "mouseover"
[13:22:58] <decx> not mouseenter?
[13:23:11] <decx> oh
[13:23:15] <duch_kazatel> $("#e_choose").on('mouseover', function() { menuElem1.slideLeftShow(500); }); - should use mouseenter
[13:23:15] <decx> read mousein
[13:23:21] <decx> it's late
[13:23:52] <jch2os> so if I want to create a link that sends data, like a get, I'm in jquery mobile by the way, do I do a <a href="#pagename?id=123">
[13:24:19] <duch_kazatel> jch2os huh?
[13:25:20] <duch_kazatel> jch2os that doesn't actually send any data to a server - anything after the hash symbol is meant for the page, not the server.
[13:25:21] <jch2os> dush_kazatel - so say I have 3 pages(is 3 divs) and the one lists a bunch of items.  Then I want when they click on that to go to another page that has the detail.  so I have  listview with links that call #itemdetail
[13:25:51] <jch2os> duch_kazatel - that is what I want, so say I send #itemdeail?id=123, how do I get the 123 from the itemdeail page?
[13:26:12] <duch_kazatel> no idea - but what I just mentioned has nothing to do with your problem :)
[13:26:56] <jch2os> lol ok thanks!
[13:32:48] <blakespot> decx:
[13:32:50] <blakespot> ok, fiddled
[13:32:52] <blakespot> http://jsfiddle.net/Dw6V8/
[13:33:08] <blakespot> the div doesn't fully disappear with page difference in fiddle but effect same
[13:33:12] <blakespot> roll onto / off of choose
[13:33:20] <blakespot> sometimes fires repreatedly
[13:33:50] <blakespot> come in from the left side as a test also
[13:33:55] <Velveeta> blakespot: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/Velveeta/Dw6V8/2/
[13:33:56] <blakespot> that is more consistenly correct
[13:34:04] <blakespot> vs from top or bottom
[13:34:22] <Velveeta> use mouseenter/mouseleave, and add an inline .stop() to your animated items to kill partial animations from completing when that state changes
[13:34:40] <blakespot> damn
[13:34:44] <blakespot> thanks
[13:34:50] <Velveeta> :)
[13:35:03] <blakespot> going hard into jquery
[13:35:08] <blakespot> it's amazing me at most steps
[13:35:16] <decx> well you still get strange behaviour if you mouseenter,mouseout in quick succession
[13:35:40] <Velveeta> yeah, paul irish has a couple of videos about "10 things i learned from reading jquery" and another about "11 more things i learned.." or something like that… a lot can be learned by reading the source itself
[13:35:47] <Velveeta> that's how i learned a crapton myself
[13:35:57] <decx> i try to avoid reyling on .animation()
[13:36:36] <Velveeta> i've gotten to be a big fan of css transitions where i can get away with them
[13:37:10] <decx> yeah, too bad i can't transition from height: inherit to height: 200px
[13:37:19] <decx> dem slidedown menus
[13:37:38] <Velveeta> you can transition from height: auto though can't you?
[13:37:44] <decx> not reliably
[13:37:47] <Velveeta> ahhh
[13:37:59] <decx> afaik
[13:38:11] <Velveeta> i also wish there was a transitionstart event that emited in addition to transitionend
[13:38:22] <decx> that sounds useful
[13:38:43] <Velveeta> i have one case with i have a transition when expanding a textarea to autofit its contents
[13:38:58] <Velveeta> and if it's in a 'busy' state, it has a little spinner in the lower right, so as the bottom drops, i'd like to keep that in sync w/ the drop
[13:39:08] <Velveeta> but instead, i have to wait for transition end and then just reposition the spinner
[13:39:18] <Velveeta> so it's slightly wonky, but good enough for my purposes
[13:39:42] <decx> well that's all you need in a pinch ;)
[13:39:48] <Velveeta> but with transition start, i could either animate it downwards in sync, manually, or just set the new position and let css animate the transition of it
[13:40:26] <blakespot> yea it is a little wonky with quick mouseovers
[13:40:36] <blakespot> could this effect be achieved exactly with transitions?
[13:40:58] <Velveeta> one way to find out! :D
[13:44:45] <blakespot> I will look into CSS transitions
[13:45:11] <Velveeta> i'm experimenting with your fiddle myself right now
[13:54:34] <maxmoore14> can someone take a look at this for me? http://jsbin.com/ayIYuvuj/1/edit?js
[13:55:04] <maxmoore14> I'm getting a "Possible strict violation'
[13:55:23] <maxmoore14> jshint doesn't like my use of "this"
[13:56:09] <maxmoore14> maybe there is a better way that using a proxy?
[13:56:51] <maxmoore14> I need to somehow identify which event triggered the handler - but both events have to share the handler
[13:58:54] <maxmoore14> hmmm, maybe something on the event object
[13:59:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah, the event object will know.
[14:02:06] <maxmoore14> cool, thx
[14:02:19] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: event.type should work, right?
[14:07:47] <Velveeta> blackspot: you still around?
[14:08:55] <BillCriswell> Ugh, timesheets.
[14:11:02] <Velveeta> damnit, not blackspot, blakespot :D
[14:11:46] <duch_kazatel> that's the one thing i DONT like about my current gig.
[14:12:10] <Velveeta> we didn't have to start doing timesheets until a little over a year ago, and it's a pain in the ass
[14:12:23] <Velveeta> so much so that it sparked a hackathon idea to streamline the process w/ a web app
[14:12:31] <duch_kazatel> we only have to clock in/clock out, no tracking or anything, but jesus
[14:12:40] <Velveeta> we have to track time per ticket
[14:13:05] <duch_kazatel> we do, too, but we're not held to any crazy standards with it, if that makes sense.
[14:14:02] <Velveeta> well i played w/ converting his code to using transitions and transforms vs js animations, but now he doesn't seem to be responding :D
[14:15:25] <decx> oh with that slide menu
[14:15:41] <BillCriswell> My old job didn't have them. The only good thing about it.
[14:16:06] <Velveeta> yep: http://jsfiddle.net/Velveeta/Dw6V8/15/
[14:18:18] <BillCriswell> It feels broke?
[14:18:26] <Velveeta> your face feels broke
[14:18:29] <decx> lazy chromer, always have to kill the prefixes on those fiddles :>
[14:18:47] <BillCriswell> ='(
[14:18:49] <Velveeta> yeah i am a lazy chromer in this circumstance, i didn't bother putting all the prefixes into place :D
[14:19:03] <BillCriswell> auto-prefixer all day err' day
[14:19:04] <decx> well we in the civilized world of ff dont use them at all
[14:19:08] <decx> ^^
[14:19:38] <Velveeta> it's amazing your machine can still execute those transitions after ff has consumed every scrap of system resources :D
[14:19:44] <BillCriswell> Haha
[14:19:53] <decx> that argument is so 7 years ago
[14:19:57] <Velveeta> lol
[14:20:04] <BillCriswell> barbarians and your vendor prefixes.
[14:20:41] <decx> but fancy translate 3d
[14:20:57] <decx> maybe opacity 1 on the hidden idea wasnt a good idea
[14:20:58] <Velveeta> and i still haven't added auto-prefixer to my grunt tasks at work, but i sure as hell plan to
[14:21:01] <decx> ;)
[14:21:06] <decx> double ide
[14:21:07] <decx> a
[14:21:13] <decx> sorry it's getting late
[14:21:14] <Velveeta> decx: yeah that opacity deal was just ported over from his original implementation
[14:21:27] <BillCriswell> Grunt is for people who know what they're doing. I am not sure I am in that category yet.
[14:21:52] <Velveeta> and gulp is for the hipster grunters
[14:22:10] <BillCriswell> Never ever heard of that. Must be hipster.
[14:22:12] <Velveeta> i have one project running on each, just to have played with them both
[14:22:38] <BillCriswell> It looks almost just like Grutn?
[14:22:40] <BillCriswell> Grunt*
[14:23:03] <Velveeta> yeah it's very similar to grunt, but a lot more intuitive to node developers i think, as it deals with stream piping through the various task phases
[14:23:23] <BillCriswell> Stream pipes?
[14:23:27] <BillCriswell> Steam*
[14:23:31] <Velveeta> one thing i like about it over grunt is that there's no need to deal with intermediate temp files like you do sometimes in grunt..
[14:23:59] <BillCriswell> CodeKit has been handling things fine for what I need to do so far.
[14:24:34] <Velveeta> in grunt, if you wanted to write something like jade markdown to be compiled into markup to make a handlebars template, and then have that precompiled down to js for inclusion as an amd module, you'd have to generate the files on each hop of that, vs just piping the file streams from one task to another
[14:24:54] <BillCriswell> I didn't really understand any of those words.
[14:25:07] <Velveeta> one of my coworkers kind of chuckled when i told him i was writing my handlebars templates in jade, but jade cuts out a lot of the cruft of writing markup :D
[14:25:15] <Velveeta> heheheh
[14:25:22] <rue> BillCriswell: Think unix pipes.
[14:25:42] <BillCriswell> rue: Does not help.
[14:26:17] <Velveeta> think of something like this: grep -i "foo" *.js | more
[14:26:27] <rue> step1 | step2 | step3 ~= step3(step2(step1()))
[14:26:43] <Velveeta> you're taking the results of that grep app and piping them into the more app
[14:26:46] <BillCriswell> Woosh
[14:27:11] <BillCriswell> ls, cs, compass watch
[14:27:17] <BillCriswell> are about the three command line thingies I know.
[14:27:32] <BillCriswell> ls cd *
[14:27:37] <Velveeta> heheheh
[14:27:41] <BillCriswell> -a shows the dot files
[14:27:48] <Velveeta> well then take this instead: http://dailyjs.com/2012/03/08/unix-node-pipes/
[14:27:50] <BillCriswell> I'm really only useful in a web browser.
[14:27:56] <Velveeta> and this: http://maxogden.com/node-streams.html
[14:28:33] <BillCriswell> Ohhh, callbacks.
[14:28:52] <BillCriswell> I probably understand a lot of this stuff but I don't know what it's called.
[14:28:52] <Velveeta> sort of, but think of them as throttled callbacks
[14:29:15] <Velveeta> imagine you have a buffer that can read in N bytes from disk and send it to a function, and at some point the buffer is full
[14:29:22] <Velveeta> it can send what it has and continue filling itself
[14:29:38] <BillCriswell> so chunking?
[14:29:41] <Velveeta> and the application it's sending it to can do the same thing, accept N bytes from that stream
[14:29:43] <Velveeta> yeah basically
[14:30:13] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[14:30:18] <BillCriswell> Maybe I'll read up a bit on the train ride home.
[14:30:20] <Velveeta> so you're basically dealing with an octet stream that can move its way from process to process
[14:30:23] <BillCriswell> Have a good night!
[14:30:27] <Velveeta> you too :)
[14:30:46] <BillCriswell> blakespot just left
[14:30:51] <BillCriswell> He ditched you. =(
[14:30:56] <Velveeta> oh well, his loss :D
[14:31:05] <BillCriswell> Haha
[14:31:07] <BillCriswell> later
[15:50:03] * anonymous6666 failed checksum òè+òàùòèòà#@@@][]][@##
[15:51:50] <duch_kazatel> bummer.
[15:52:41] * anonymous6666 Thinking....
[16:00:17] <ShawnRisk> How do I stop the $(this).effect from happening if I scroll down the page before this is over?
[16:00:29] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:00:33] <duch_kazatel> like, cancel the event?
[16:00:43] <ShawnRisk> yes
[16:00:47] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: pming you
[16:00:54] <duch_kazatel> please don't.
[16:00:57] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:01:03] <ShawnRisk> okay
[16:01:15] <duch_kazatel> if it's an animation, check out .stop();
[16:01:35] <ShawnRisk> $(this).effect( "pulsate", {times:5}, 35000);
[16:02:23] <duch_kazatel> git .stop() a try, though I'm not sure why you'd want to cancel it.
[16:02:50] <lasha> guys guys
[16:02:56] <lasha> and girls, obviously
[16:03:01] <lasha> i'm about to fucking shoot myself in the foot
[16:03:16] <lasha> i'm checking if a variable exists
[16:03:21] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: because, if you scroll down the animation is suppose to stop, and new elements are suppose to show up.  Yet they do show up but it is annoying to have the animation still going.
[16:03:27] <lasha> and the browser throws a stupid undefined eerror
[16:03:38] <ShawnRisk> right, you should be saying girls
[16:03:40] <lasha> Uncaught ReferenceError: stateMap is not defined
[16:03:57] <lasha> i KNOW stateMap is not defined. that's precisely what i'm looking for
[16:04:00] <lasha> but it just dies.
[16:04:19] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk then check out .stop()
[16:04:22] <duch_kazatel> lasha how are you testing?
[16:04:32] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: do you want to see the live example?
[16:04:37] <lasha> if(stateMap){....} else {…}
[16:04:42] <lasha> it literally just died.
[16:04:46] <lasha> with this thrown Uncaught ReferenceError: stateMap is not defined
[16:04:50] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[16:04:57] <duch_kazatel> if (typeof variable === 'undefined'){}
[16:05:04] <lasha> my if nor else runs.
[16:05:16] <duch_kazatel> correct, that's the idea - look at the code i just pasted.
[16:05:21] <lasha> i want the else to run
[16:05:31] <lasha> because stateMap isn't defined or declared or anything
[16:05:33] <duch_kazatel> then typeof variable !== 'undefined'
[16:06:26] <duch_kazatel> or if (stateMap != null){}
[16:06:41] <duch_kazatel> either one of those will work.  test for typeof or compare to null.
[16:06:43] <duch_kazatel> good to go.
[16:07:04] <lasha> lemme try
[16:08:02] <lasha> i've tested undefined vars before by just doing if(varname){}
[16:08:04] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk the other choice is .pulsate("destroy");
[16:08:06] <lasha> and never got errors..
[16:08:07] <lasha> wtf?
[16:08:13] <duch_kazatel> lasha that's not a valid way to do that.
[16:08:28] <lasha> how come?
[16:08:53] <duch_kazatel> because varName doesn't evaluate to anything until you at least declare it via var varName;
[16:08:58] <duch_kazatel> until then, you cannot evaluate it.
[16:08:59] <duch_kazatel> period.
[16:09:05] <lasha> that's crazy.
[16:09:08] <lasha> i've done it before.
[16:09:13] <lasha> or so i think....
[16:09:15] <lasha> i don't get it
[16:09:17] <duch_kazatel> then the variable existed.
[16:09:32] <lasha> i asked my colleague and he was baffled too
[16:09:35] <lasha> and he's like a js god. lol
[16:09:58] <duch_kazatel> you have to compare to null/undefined or see its type.
[16:10:43] <lasha> i did compare to undefined before
[16:10:43] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: nothing is working.
[16:10:44] <lasha> it didn't work.
[16:10:47] <lasha> same prob.
[16:10:52] <duch_kazatel> lasha did you use === or ==?
[16:10:57] <lasha> both!
[16:10:57] <lasha> lol
[16:11:08] <lasha> (tried both)
[16:11:08] <duch_kazatel> lasha you're misremembering something or....
[16:11:18] <duch_kazatel> and ShawnRisk dunno what to tell you?
[16:11:23] <ShawnRisk> ok
[16:11:27] <duch_kazatel> do the position of elements on the page change?
[16:11:35] <lasha> duch_kazatel: i dunno. hopefully. lol
[16:17:08] <ShawnRisk> I am confused
[16:17:29] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk about?
[16:18:00] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: how to make this smooth and stop the animation.
[16:18:09] <duch_kazatel> make what smooth?
[16:18:22] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: want to see live example?
[16:18:33] <duch_kazatel> sure why not i have a few minutes to kill.
[16:19:02] <ShawnRisk> http://wadevs.com/Music/ the word ILLANGELO
[16:19:31] <duch_kazatel> you mean the initial flash?
[16:20:11] <_naeluh_> yo !
[16:20:40] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk what method are you running on that logo?
[16:21:46] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yes and that effect is what I said above
[16:24:05] <duch_kazatel> $('#logo').stop(); - that works.
[16:25:13] <decx> is it just supposed to fade in once?
[16:25:37] <ShawnRisk> decx: no
[16:26:10] <decx> why not :>
[16:26:34] <ShawnRisk> decx: to be like a flashing light
[16:27:37] <ShawnRisk> It is suppose to be smoother, but I am not sure how to do that
[16:30:19] <ShawnRisk> Here is what is suppose to happen the logo is suppose to appear flat plain then glitch and fad in and out soft.  Am I not doing that?
[16:31:02] <decx> good lord i nearly had an aneurysm just reading that
[16:31:27] <ShawnRisk> why?
[16:32:09] <decx> seems so ridiculous, i dont think pulsate has a glitch out function ;)
[16:33:31] <ShawnRisk> decx: me either, then what should I use?
[16:37:10] <jphase> hmm, webkit keyframes ftw!
[16:42:29] <jphase> ShawnRisk: are you just trying to fade in and out on a loop?
[16:44:21] <ShawnRisk> jphase: did you see the site?  If so, if you see the logo.js file, that is what I am doing and the pulsate effect is what I am doing.
[16:44:34] <ShawnRisk> using*
[16:44:50] <jphase> well it's just a couple lines of jQuery:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/hv56G/
[16:47:17] <ShawnRisk> jphase: how do you do that 5 times and for 7 seconds each time, and stop when you scroll down?
[16:47:48] <jphase> ShawnRisk: use a counter variable, and when it hits 5 then stop recursing
[16:48:02] <jphase> as for 7 seconds, if you mean 7 seconds total then that'd be changing the interval to 3500
[16:48:38] <ShawnRisk> jphase: Also your code starts automatically, what about waiting a second or two.
[16:48:51] <jphase> put breathe() in setInterval
[16:48:54] <jphase> er
[16:48:57] <jphase> setTimeout()
[16:49:14] <decx> better yet, ditch the animation js and do it in css keyframes
[16:49:22] <jphase> hah, that was my first suggestions
[16:49:23] <jphase> -s
[16:50:07] <ShawnRisk> looking at this
[16:50:19] <decx> even put a glitch in ;) http://jsfiddle.net/yk6vj/
[16:50:45] <decx> sorry to webkit for not using prefixes, sort it out
[16:52:42] <ShawnRisk> I am too confused and will leave this as is
[16:52:52] <ShawnRisk> Is this okay the way it is?
[16:53:13] <jphase> if you're okay with a weird flash at the beginning, sure?
[16:54:11] <ShawnRisk> jphase: well I am not sure how to fix this properly even with instructions.  Maybe I have been working at this too long.
[16:57:06] <jphase> here, let me show you
[17:11:03] <ShawnRisk> jphase: are you still there?
[17:11:09] <jphase> yep
[17:11:24] <jphase> oh "there"?
[17:11:24] <jphase> no
[17:11:25] <ShawnRisk> are you still in the collaboration?
[17:11:34] <ShawnRisk> I have one more question on that
[17:12:17] <ShawnRisk> jphase: did you see that?
[17:13:04] <jphase> send again
[17:13:53] <ShawnRisk> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/hv56G/
[17:14:40] <jphase> that looks like outdated code to me
[17:14:56] <TheJHNZ> does anyone know a library like google drive's colaborative docs ?
[17:15:12] <ShawnRisk> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/hv56G/#run&togetherjs=sz3FMSzq1n
[17:15:44] <ShawnRisk> jphase: this is the correct one: http://jsfiddle.net/hv56G/2/#&togetherjs=sz3FMSzq1n
[17:41:44] <ShawnRisk> how do I scroll to top I have tried // Set scroll position to the top     	window.scrollTo(0, 0); but on my site it is not working and in Chrome
[17:44:10] <doug65536> ShawnRisk:  i think it's $(window).scrollTop(0)
[17:45:15] <doug65536> or to completely scroll to the top left, $(window).scrollTop(0).scrollLeft(0)
[17:46:42] <ShawnRisk> doug65536: neither are working on my site.
[17:47:38] <ShawnRisk> jphase: I am still there if you are
[17:47:45] <doug65536> ShawnRisk: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/s76Pv/
[17:48:53] <ShawnRisk> doug65536: well not on my site
[17:49:16] <ShawnRisk> I am going to leave this out
[17:49:18] <ShawnRisk> I am done
[17:49:20] <ShawnRisk> need to eat
[17:50:23] <jphase> ShawnRisk: if you want to override the browser's "resume scroll position" then you'll probably need that in window.load and might even need to do a setTimeout on it with 1 ms to push to the end of the stack
[17:50:37] <ShawnRisk> okay I will not do that
[17:50:38] <jphase> I gotta get back to work, can't help anymore, sorry ShawnRisk
[17:50:41] <ShawnRisk> Overriding for me sucks
[17:50:44] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[18:34:31] <Richard82> hi
[18:34:53] <Richard82> I'd like to ask for help
[18:35:26] <Richard82> There is an invisible <div> element  (visibility:hidden;)  which should be displayed when hovering a certain link
[18:35:30] <Richard82> sounds easy,  but I cannot get it work
[18:35:59] <Richard82> I worked out an example page,  (very small html site) so that I can show what I achieved in the meantime.
[19:23:42] * anonymous6666 gnight =)
[19:25:39] <coldhead> bye forever anonymous6666
[19:25:48] <coldhead> ah snovesy <3
[19:25:59] <snover> oh hi clod
[19:26:21] <coldhead> i'm learning Javascript, snover
[19:26:37] <coldhead> var and apply and bind and so on
[19:27:15] <snover> how about +, did you learn about that?
[19:28:11] <coldhead> yes i am a little confused about that one
[19:28:13] <snover> i’m learning about the netflix loading screen
[19:28:19] <snover> it says loading
[19:28:33] <coldhead> did you hear gmail was down?
[19:28:45] <snover> is gmail hosted by netflix?
[19:28:56] <coldhead> i think they're both hosted by justin bieber
[19:29:18] <coldhead> while you wait, snover, do you have any advice for someone learning javascript?
[19:29:32] <evilbug> coldhead: yeah, read up bruh.
[19:29:35] <snover> don’t do it
[19:29:45] <coldhead> getting mixed signals here
[19:30:16] <evilbug> coldhead: feels like hitting on a girl, bruh.
[19:30:30] <coldhead> i don't know what that feels like
[19:30:43] <evilbug> coldhead: or a guy, whatever you're into.
[19:31:15] <coldhead> once i reach puberty, then i will know
[19:31:36] <evilbug> yeah, puberty doesn't hit till 38.
[19:32:07] <evilbug> coldhead: try codecademy and some videos. maybe tutsplus?
[19:32:50] <coldhead> okay
[19:33:20] <evilbug> coldhead: actually this guy might help, i've found a bunch of his stuff useful > http://leveluptuts.com/tutorials
[19:33:42] <evilbug> coldhead: in the end though you need to actually apply what you learn in order to properly learn it.
[19:34:32] <coldhead> yes, i read about .apply()
[19:34:36] <coldhead> i haven't used it yet though
[20:22:39] <gry> wow. how do i retrieve human readable time in js or jquery? so many web search results are poor
[20:24:17] <coldhead> gry: i don't touch dates or times in JS without http://momentjs.com/
[20:24:36] <gry> coldhead, it's a script for a wiki, can't really add libs there
[20:25:17] <coldhead> may god have mercy on your soul then
[20:30:36] <gry> https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gryllida/common.js readability of Page.prototype.decline is of concern; hints how to improve?
[20:33:19] <coldhead> gry: i would give all your anonymous functions names
[20:33:24] <coldhead> and then refer to those
[20:33:25] <coldhead> so
[20:33:28] <gry> which ones for example?
[20:33:37] <coldhead> .then(function(data){ would be .then(processResult)
[20:33:48] <gry> mmm
[20:33:59] <coldhead> all the fns you're passing to .then() and .fail()
[20:34:13] <gry> ya thanks i will try
[20:34:16] <coldhead> this isn't terribly unreadable, it still fits on a screen
[20:34:27] <coldhead> but that way your code will look more like sentences
[20:34:37] <coldhead> .then(processResults).fail(abortHorribly)
[21:27:49] <ShawnRisk> How do I set this for $(this).delay(100).fadeTo(100,0.5).delay(100).fadeTo(100,1, pulse); to happen for 7 times before moving onto other items in the function?  Is this the right way to make an effect that looks like a bad light?
[22:13:03] <gry> Hi, https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gryllida/common.js I appear to lose 'this' when I go from Page.prototype.decline to the next function (self.query logs 'undefined' in the next function)
[23:00:36] <firebird1> how do jquery does disable of copy/paste in hackery way ?
[23:00:59] <firebird1> tried in js didnt work
