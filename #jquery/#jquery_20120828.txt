[00:11:33] <softmanpetro> will this syntax work for all the id's starting with player_ $('*[id^="player_"]')  ? it looks no
[00:14:51] <softmanpetro> I use alert($('[id^="orders_filters_"]').length);
[00:15:44] <rgr> remove the quotes I think around the text. try it in the console.
[00:17:00] <rgr> If I have a selector like this $(".nothanks .centercontainer .listevent") : how so I specifiy all ".cnetercontainer .listevent" elements which do NOT have .nothanks before them? Im having trouble getting not sorted out in my haed.
[00:19:55] <Koganei> rgr: http://api.jquery.com/not/ ?
[00:20:04] <Koganei> just add .not('.nothanks')
[00:27:52] <rgr> Koganei: is it not better to do that filter first somehow?
[00:31:55] <davetarmac> morning all
[00:32:23] <davetarmac> I heard a rumour that jQuery doesn't contain a regex filter
[00:32:26] <softmanpetro> I try to get all element whichs id start with that order_filters_.... but alert($('[id^="orders_filters_"]').length); is 0 ! any hint please ?
[00:33:55] <rgr> hmm and it doesnt do what I wanted anyway.
[00:35:05] <davetarmac> I have a <body> tag with lots of classes in it and I need to show something on a page that has two classes, however one would need to contain a given string.
[00:35:32] <davetarmac> I have used .hasClass on the body to find the parent class, but I am struggling with the one that I need to find a substring in
[00:36:07] <davetarmac> for instance, the class on a page is: product-moscow-faux-fur-pillbox-hat
[00:36:17] <davetarmac> but I need to check for the 'pillbox-hat' part
[00:36:26] <rgr> is there a way to run jquery in emacs so its run in the attached browser (preferably chrome) and results are back in emacs buffer?
[00:36:46] <rgr> wrong group sorry
[00:36:50] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[00:37:19] <davetarmac> Eviltwin: wow - that should do it
[00:38:12] <softmanpetro> in fact firebugh shows there are 73 elements
[00:38:32] <rgr> davetarmac: heres something I knocked up but is probabl really inefficient http://pastebin.com/fuVLf28g
[00:39:20] <rgr> Eviltwin: can one get the specific phrase from the attribute that matches?
[00:39:52] <softmanpetro> hehe document.ready
[00:40:08] <rgr> e.g get "eviltwinman" from "hello eviltwinman there" in the * match?
[00:40:23] <davetarmac> Eviltwin, rgr - thanks for the help
[00:41:56] <Eviltwin> rgr: So you want to do [class*="foo"]
[00:42:11] <Eviltwin> And get the "foo" from "alice foo bob"?
[00:42:40] <rgr> yes, but I want the matching phrase so I can then parse it. see example above where I get eviltwinman when I match eviltwin.
[00:42:42] <davetarmac> I tried to do this, but seems to general - for some reason it's adding the class on brim-hats too http://pastebin.com/SE02khhm
[00:43:13] <rgr> no, I get foobar from matching foo against "alice foobar bob"
[00:44:20] <Eviltwin> You could do attrStr.match(/\S*foo\S*/)
[00:44:24] <Eviltwin> And see what results you get
[00:44:53] <rgr> attrStr is what? I want to match aganst class names only
[00:45:10] <Eviltwin> Replace attrStr with element.className
[00:45:20] <rgr> eg see the pastebin link above to see whats probably pretty inefficient
[00:45:35] <Eviltwin> This really isn't how classes were designed to be used
[00:45:37] <rgr> ok I'll try the * match then break it down further with that
[00:45:47] <davetarmac> OK, mine plainly didn't work :)
[00:45:47] <rgr> yes I know, but its convenient for me ;)
[00:46:06] <rgr> thanks for your time.
[00:46:13] <Eviltwin> And a .filter callback shouldn't have side effects
[00:46:28] <Eviltwin> Have you considered data attributes for this?
[00:46:43] <davetarmac> goshdarnit - rookie mistake
[00:46:58] <NodeX> why dont you just split the prop("class") on " " and check the first array member?
[00:47:24] <NodeX> if you really must write inefficient code at least make it easy for yourself
[00:48:15] <davetarmac> NodeX: me?
[00:48:30] <Eviltwin> softmanpetro: http://jsfiddle.net/MjrPq/
[00:48:42] <NodeX> whomever was trying to match the first part of class
[00:50:00] <davetarmac> NodeX: not I then, I'm trying to find part of a class in a series of classes
[00:53:42] <Eviltwin> I still recommend a data attribute or even multiple data attributes
[00:53:57] <Eviltwin> But I'm leaving now
[00:54:02] <Eviltwin> So it's up to you I guess
[00:55:10] <davetarmac> hmm - this works: $('body[class*="pillbox-hat"]').addClass('hat-page');
[00:55:43] <davetarmac> but I need to combine that with $('body').hasClass('catalog-product-view') to add the class I need to add
[00:55:57] <davetarmac> I tried combining them as an if, but that didn't seem to work nicely
[00:56:04] <davetarmac> (read: at all)
[01:06:46] <bobosomfan> Hi! I'm wondering why this isn't working: http://pastie.org/4602270
[01:07:39] <xec_> bobosomfan: it's not working because alert() will not change any color :P
[01:08:00] <bobosomfan> But it doesn't even react when I'm clicking the checkbox
[01:08:17] <xec_> there is no checkbox in that paste though
[01:08:21] <seutje> is the checkbox in the page when this is called?
[01:08:32] <bobosomfan> No, they're created dynamically
[01:08:56] <NodeX> you can use :checkbox aswell ;)
[01:08:57] <seutje> use on on the wrapper then
[01:09:39] <bobosomfan> NodeX: Read that with :checkbox it took longer time
[01:09:48] <bobosomfan> seutje: on on?
[01:11:07] <xec_> bobosomfan: attach to an ancestor element that will always be available, and use a selector as second argument to .on(), see http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[01:11:28] <seutje> bobosomfan: I make u example: http://jsfiddle.net/QnDZ6/
[01:11:32] <rgr> NodeX: I did. See the pastebin.
[01:12:26] <bobosomfan> xec_: seutje: Thanks!
[01:12:33] <rgr> I dont use data attributes since the admin ui only allows the setting of the classes. thanks anywy.
[01:12:57] <seutje> bobosomfan: it's sorta like the old live(), but instead of binding to the entire document, u reduce the scope to the wrapper element
[01:13:36] <seutje> I think... this is my first day using jQuery...
[01:14:19] <bobosomfan> seutje: Haha okay! Know quite much after only one day I must say
[01:14:44] <seutje> it's all about the docs, baby!
[01:16:02] <bobosomfan> seutje: It's boring to read alot!
[01:25:41] <davetarmac> hmm - anyone know why this doesn't work correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/K3PKA/
[01:25:54] <davetarmac> it shouldn't be changing the text blue
[01:26:12] <davetarmac> as the 2nd condition of the if isn't correct
[01:27:18] <davetarmac> is it something simple that I've missed?
[01:29:01] <Koganei> oh
[01:29:02] <Koganei> davetarmac
[01:29:15] <davetarmac> Koganei: yup?
[01:29:22] <Koganei> $('#checkme[class*="largehats"]') returns a jQuery helement
[01:29:24] <Koganei> element*
[01:29:28] <Koganei> check length
[01:29:40] <Koganei> http://jsfiddle.net/K3PKA/1/
[01:30:33] <davetarmac> ahh right
[01:30:38] <davetarmac> so yes, something silly :)
[01:31:07] <davetarmac> the api didn't mention that
[01:31:17] <davetarmac> thanks for pointing that out, Koganei
[01:32:12] <davetarmac> and it works perfectly now!
[01:32:16] <davetarmac> danke
[01:41:16] <davetarmac> hmm - I could probably make this better
[01:41:30] <Koganei> np
[01:41:31] <davetarmac> it's working now, but not very easy to maintain
[01:41:52] <Koganei> what are you doing, and why does it involve so many hats?
[01:42:12] <davetarmac> Koganei: heh - it's a Magento Go site, and I can only add HTML using jQuery basically
[01:42:23] <davetarmac> it's not just hats, it's other things - just hats was my test case
[01:42:43] <Koganei> I zee
[01:42:49] <Koganei> I don't know what Magento Go is
[01:42:59] <caddoo> Is there a way to override the default jquery AJAX behavior, i remember vaguely someone talking about AJaxOptions
[01:43:00] <davetarmac> You've heard of Magento?
[01:43:11] <Koganei> google will tell me now
[01:43:13] <caddoo> basically I want to change the behavior depending on the HTTP response code
[01:43:17] <davetarmac> ecommerce platform
[01:43:25] <davetarmac> well, Go is their hoste, turnkey solution
[01:43:29] <davetarmac> *hosted
[01:43:31] <Koganei> aah I see
[01:44:26] <Koganei> sounds painful
[01:44:36] <davetarmac> Very
[01:45:28] <PlasmaBunny> is there any jquery plugin for creating 'graphic map' of document?
[01:45:38] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. store it as array of array of rgb
[01:45:39] <christophler> PlasmaBunny: wah?
[01:45:46] <seutje> caddoo: $.ajaxSetup() is used to set defaults, which can be overridden by/for individual $.ajax() calls
[01:46:02] <caddoo> right ok
[01:46:05] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. i have 2 divs on document, then i want to do var documentmap=$('body').dumpgraphics();
[01:46:09] <caddoo> thanks seutje
[01:46:16] <PlasmaBunny> and documentmap will contain array of array of rgb pixels
[01:46:18] <PlasmaBunny> of entire body
[01:46:37] <seutje> caddoo: this can be used to setup global ajax error handling, so individual calls don't have define an error handler
[01:46:40] <juha_> maybe with some canvas
[01:46:48] <caddoo> that's exactly what I need
[01:46:59] <caddoo> mainly for 404 requests
[01:47:34] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: how?
[01:48:21] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: not sure but i'm pretty sure that getting rgb values from each pixel of the page is pretty hard without canvas and that's a different thing than plain divs
[01:48:54] <Koganei> yeah, what juha said
[01:49:27] <PlasmaBunny> well, this must be universal
[01:50:05] <Koganei> if juha_ said it
[01:50:48] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: does it have to be done on frontend? you could do it on backend with a screenshot and parsing the image
[01:52:06] <Guddu_> Hi All...I have this simple code http://dpaste.org/WaUrP/ Somehow the <H1> element does not get populate with the value of first_name...Could you please help me? Am i missing something here?
[01:52:41] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: yes, it has to be done on frontend
[01:52:50] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: i am creating jBunny plugin
[01:52:58] <PlasmaBunny> bunny must know what elements there are to jump around them
[01:53:26] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. $('div.bunnyplace').jBunny();
[01:53:27] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: ehh ok, well then you should control the elements and therefore you know each location
[01:53:36] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: well this won't be portable
[01:53:39] <PlasmaBunny> and hard
[01:53:54] <PlasmaBunny> just doing $('div.bunnyplace').jBunny(); will be much easier
[01:54:07] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: i don't see why you need to get rgb values for each element, just control the elements and you know where the bunny can and can't jump
[01:54:13] <Guddu_> PlasmaBunny, Can u help me please?
[01:54:18] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: how about background images?
[01:54:22] <Guddu_> :)
[01:54:38] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: there can be a div with cage drawn in background
[01:54:49] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: check canvas, that could be your solution if it doesn't necessarily need to be div
[01:54:49] <PlasmaBunny> then $('div.cage').jBunny(40,40); will be called
[01:54:56] <PlasmaBunny> bunny must be able to know that he's inside the cage
[01:55:33] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: jBunny plugin must be portable enough to be used anywhere
[01:55:36] <PlasmaBunny> on any website
[01:55:57] <juha_> well, good luck with that, but from here you can find a lot of canvas examples: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/
[01:56:16] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: there is no point in plugin if it will require retemplating page to use it
[01:56:33] <PlasmaBunny> it must be able to be used on any template/page
[01:56:44] <Guddu> Hi All...I have this simple code http://dpaste.org/WaUrP/ Somehow the <H1> element does not get populate with the value of first_name...Could you please help me? Am i missing something here?
[01:57:26] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: ok, well maybe your approach is wrong, i don't think you need to know the color of each pixel on a single page
[01:57:27] <Cork> Guddu: cause h1 isn't a form element
[01:57:36] <Cork> Guddu: it doesn't have a value field
[01:57:37] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: maybe you just need to know the positions of the elements
[01:57:39] <Cork> so use .html
[01:58:01] <Guddu> Cork, Thanks I will try now
[01:58:39] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: bunny must see colors
[01:58:45] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. it may want to try eating green stuff
[01:58:51] <PlasmaBunny> and not eating red stuff
[01:59:09] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: and position of elements is not enough
[01:59:14] <PlasmaBunny> because there can be background images
[01:59:22] <juha_> dude
[01:59:26] <juha_> check canvas
[01:59:33] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: plugin must be PORTABLE
[01:59:42] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: SO FUCKING INSERT CANVAS.
[01:59:45] <PlasmaBunny> without people have to rewrite their website to us it
[01:59:48] <juha_> there you go, portable game.
[01:59:48] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: so?
[02:00:02] <PlasmaBunny> how can i dump page contents in canvas then?
[02:00:16] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: its not a game btw
[02:00:31] <PlasmaBunny> bunny won't conflict with normal website operation
[02:00:39] <PlasmaBunny> it will just run around, eat stuff
[02:00:48] <PlasmaBunny> if there are 2 bunnies, maybe mate and spawn little bunnies
[02:00:51] <PlasmaBunny> etc
[02:00:57] <PlasmaBunny> still, website will be functional
[02:01:01] <PlasmaBunny> links clickable etc
[02:01:23] <Guddu> Cork ... :-) It worked :)
[02:01:25] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: if i would be doing that, i would either use canvas or then take control of the elements, make some green, some something else and then the code would see that this is green and i can eat it
[02:01:56] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: sure. but this can't be accomplished with just including jBunny.js and doing $('body').jBunny();
[02:02:04] <PlasmaBunny> much work will be needed
[02:02:17] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: i don't see any problems with that
[02:02:25] <PlasmaBunny> everything must work only after $('body').jBunny(); on any website
[02:02:30] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: have you done any plugins before?
[02:02:35] <PlasmaBunny> no.
[02:02:56] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: what do you mean by 'use canvas'?
[02:02:57] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: ok, well you can easily control _every_ element on a page within a plugin, it's just a matter of selectors
[02:02:59] <PlasmaBunny> plugin will use it?
[02:03:08] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: sure. what about background images?
[02:03:12] <PlasmaBunny> or css3 effects
[02:03:20] <PlasmaBunny> or imgs, iframes
[02:03:26] <PlasmaBunny> flash videos
[02:03:27] <PlasmaBunny> etc etc etc
[02:03:42] <PlasmaBunny> DOM must be converted into RGB array
[02:03:53] <PlasmaBunny> otherwise it won't be universal
[02:03:58] <juha_> ... ok, i suggest you to learn basic selectors from jquery first, then learn how to manipulate things (add css etc)
[02:04:05] <juha_> also, i'm now out of this discussion.
[02:04:11] <blackspotwiggins> well at least he has a filename and a method name
[02:04:16] <blackspotwiggins> those are the most important bits :)
[02:05:23] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: how about background images?
[02:05:42] <PlasmaBunny> juha_: also, my primary question was about a plugin that does that
[02:05:47] <PlasmaBunny> surely i can implement it myself, in time
[02:06:03] <PlasmaBunny> i just want to make sure that no DOM->RGB plugin is out there already done
[02:06:18] <juha_> have you googled?
[02:06:24] <PlasmaBunny> yes.
[02:07:07] <mc_teo> hi there
[02:13:00] <shoky> uhh. DOM -> RGB    <--- that's pretty much what you call a rendering engine. e.g. webkit
[02:15:10] <shoky> well, DOM+CSS->RGB or smth.
[02:18:54] <mc_teo> does anyone have any idea why this wouldn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/WrDxn/1/
[02:19:17] <rgr> Sorry, but "not" is wrecking my head. Clearly I have a tick... ;) I have this selector : $('.centercontainer .listevent[class*="auto"]')
[02:19:46] <rgr> now this works BUT I want to prefix with "not adminmode class" e.g I dont want to match $('.adminmode .centercontainer .listevent[class*="auto"]')
[02:20:19] <rgr> or rather I want all the elements selected by the first so long as .adminmode isnt a parent class.
[02:22:59] <shoky> rgr: i guess one simple way would be to add: .not('.adminmode *')
[02:24:02] <rgr> genius! Thanks. I need to read about how jq constrcts selectors more I think. Many thanks!
[02:24:26] <rgr> (ps about 20 people told me I only need .not(".adminmode") .. they were wrong.
[02:24:44] <jlebrech> why does jquery do a request when I create an img tag in memory, i.e $("<img src='http://placekitten.org/100'/>") shouldn't it only request that image when it's displayed on the page?
[02:24:47] <rgr> Is there no way of putting hte "not" on the adminmode part of hte original selector like eg :first?
[02:26:20] <mazzachre> I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/RD9sE/83/ (rather a mess by now... don't worry) Is there some automatic way to make the tooltip disapear when the "alert" happens? (It happens with a jQUI window widget as well) Currently the tooltip will just sit there until another element is tooltipped...
[02:27:15] <shoky> mc_teo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/WrDxn/2/
[02:27:18] <mazzachre> My current solution is to remember to put $(this).tooltip('hide'); before the alert... but an automagical solution would be nice... (There might be different cirumstances than a drag stop to cause this)
[02:27:55] <jlebrech> rgr: have you tried using not on the class http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[02:28:18] <shoky> mc_teo: .animate is for regular numeric css stuff. not special shit
[02:30:16] <shoky> rgr: i think you could do  $('.centercontainer .listevent[class*="auto"]:not(.adminmode *)')  but i'm not sure
[02:30:27] <shoky> rgr: but please don't ;)
[02:31:19] <rgr> I was hoping for the "not" nearer the "root" if you get my meaing. Something like $(".adminmode:not .centercontainer .listement [class*="auto"]')
[02:31:31] <rgr> but the original suggestion you gave shoky works
[02:31:57] <shoky> jlebrech: when you create a new image tag or object in memory the browser will automatically try to fetch it
[02:32:15] <shoky> jlebrech: it's not jquery
[02:32:26] <rgr> tha why I say I need to gen up on how jq actually works - it seems it would be more "optimised" to do the not earlier rather than lter but not knowing how it works internally its total guesswork on my part ;)
[02:33:10] <shoky> rgr: jq tries to follow regular CSS selectors
[02:34:04] <shoky> rgr: and if you did   $(':not(.adminmode) .centercontainer .listelement[class*=auto]')
[02:35:52] <shoky> rgr: that wouldn't work because it could for example match  'body .centercontainer .listelement...'  even though there might be some div with .adminmode in between body and .centercontainer
[02:36:23] <shoky> eh bad explanation
[02:36:46] <tocka> morning
[02:37:12] <mc_teo> shoky: how would one then reverse the rotation? .removeClass('rotated') doesnt seem to work
[02:37:20] <tocka> I have slider (bxslider), I was wondering is it possible to make that if the person is on the second slide then something shows up lets say an alert?
[02:37:26] <tocka> is it possible to track divs
[02:37:39] <tocka> or something, don't know really know how to explain it in a better way
[02:37:58] <shoky> mc_teo: i think you'd need something like an .unrotated class  that would have 0deg
[02:38:04] <blackspotwiggins> rgr, :not uses parenthesis
[02:38:15] <blackspotwiggins> like :not(.something)
[02:38:15] <shoky> mc_teo: well it doesnt have to be in a special class, it could be specified for those elements
[02:39:37] <shoky> mc_teo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/WrDxn/3/
[02:40:14] <shoky> mc_teo actually you don't need the 0deg  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/WrDxn/4/
[02:40:30] <shoky> mc_teo: but it needed to have the transition specified for the image, regardless of if its rotated or not
[02:42:37] <mc_teo> shoky: why shouldn't this work then? http://jsfiddle.net/kyfL3/1/
[02:43:18] <shoky> mc_teo: .delay is for queued stuff (like animations created with .animate). it doesnt have any effect on addClass or removeClass
[02:44:25] <jlebrech> shoky: wow ok, chrome; what an ass
[02:45:19] <shoky> jlebrech: without that behaviour, (selective) image preloading wouldn't be possible ;P
[02:45:55] <shoky> or, well, without a different API
[02:49:43] <jlebrech> it's odd because the dom element is in a variable and not on the page tho
[02:50:32] <mc_teo> shoky: what if I used jquery ui's addClass and removeClass? they use animations, no?
[02:52:00] <rgr> blackspotwiggins: so I would expect this to work but alas not. $(':not(.adminmode) .listevent[class*="autofade"]'). What does work is $('.listevent[class*="autofade"]').not(".adminmode *") which I dont really like but does the job.
[02:53:40] <shoky> mc_teo: dont think so..
[02:54:34] <blackspotwiggins> rgr, i'd use .fliter tbh
[02:54:41] <blackspotwiggins> or just make my html better
[02:55:20] <rgr> html better? Theres nothing semantically wrong with wanting a selctor thats not processed by a certain class. Its what filter does anyway and .not() does.
[02:55:43] <rgr> $('.listevent[class*="autofade"]').not(".adminmode *").each() is what I want.
[02:56:11] <rgr> far neater than using filter and then eaching after the filter.
[02:56:21] <shoky> .not is just a filter anyway..
[02:58:25] <blackspotwiggins> yeah but filter with .closest() would be better IMO
[02:58:27] <shoky> but i do agree with blackspotwiggins that you could make your html better (and consequently, your selectors more simple)
[02:59:47] <shoky> ah filter with closest(), yeah that'd prolly be better performance-wise
[03:03:06] <jlebrech> rgr: can't you use $.not on it's own?
[03:05:56] <rgr> ?
[03:06:16] <rgr> $('.listevent[class*="autofade"]').not(".adminmode *").each() : how would you change it?
[03:07:20] <rgr> you cant select an"optimise" "better" html unless oyu kow the features jq provides. In this case the minority situation is when the body is tagged with "adminmode" class". Nothing else changes.
[03:07:41] <shoky> it's the body?
[03:08:18] <shoky> $('body:not(.adminmode) .listevent[class*=autofade]')
[03:09:26] <blackspotwiggins> .listevent.autofade?
[03:10:53] <shoky> if ( ! $('body').is('.adminmode') )  { $('.listevent[class*=autofade]').whatever() }
[03:19:32] <mc_teo> shoky: is there anything I can do to line block the queue then?
[03:20:11] <mc_teo> I had planned to rotate it 180 degrees, with back side of image hidden, then change the image for something else
[03:20:25] <mc_teo> then rotate back to 0 degrees
[03:20:30] <shoky> mc_teo: you can use setTimeout, or you can use .delay with .queue, or depending on what you want exactly, you can maybe do it with pure CSS
[03:46:39] <PlasmaBunny> hi
[03:46:52] <PlasmaBunny> is there a way to know what will be the next element added to DOM?
[03:48:06] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. var el=$.nextElementThatWillBeAddedToDOM();
[03:48:11] <PlasmaBunny> does jquery have any such functions?
[03:48:28] <blackspotwiggins> it cant predict the future, no
[03:48:49] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: why?
[03:50:16] <blackspotwiggins> did you seriously ask why a js library cant predict the future?
[03:51:37] <NodeX> LOL
[03:51:48] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: i don't need it to predict when by bus comes or stuff
[03:51:55] <PlasmaBunny> i simply need to know the next element
[03:52:07] <blackspotwiggins> good luck with that dude
[03:52:16] <NodeX> your app knows when it's inserting because you tell it to, ergo it's an appside problem
[03:52:43] <PlasmaBunny> yes
[03:52:56] <PlasmaBunny> but i need to know that before
[03:53:02] <PlasmaBunny> do change my actions maybe
[03:53:05] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844565/is-there-a-jquery-dom-change-listener
[03:53:06] <PlasmaBunny> to *
[03:53:11] <NodeX> if you want to bind to the addition of an element look at a plugin called livequery
[03:53:11] <PlasmaBunny> no.
[03:53:31] <PlasmaBunny> NodeX: i need it before this addition
[03:53:40] <NodeX> then you're out of luck
[03:53:44] <PlasmaBunny> why?
[03:53:49] <NodeX> because it's impossible
[03:53:54] <PlasmaBunny> um, why?
[03:54:04] <NodeX> how long is a piece of string?
[03:54:05] <blackspotwiggins> PlasmaBunny, whats the next word im gonna type?
[03:54:13] <NodeX> troll!
[03:54:15] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: troll
[03:54:21] <PlasmaBunny> but now you won't type it
[03:54:22] <blackspotwiggins> wrong, bitch
[03:54:31] <PlasmaBunny> because you didn't want to make me seem right
[03:54:35] <NodeX> LOL
[03:54:42] <juha_> i hope jquery would be able to predict future
[03:54:52] <juha_> we would all be millionaires
[03:54:55] <NodeX> jquery + stock prices plugin ftw
[03:55:00] <juha_> yeah!
[03:55:11] <PlasmaBunny> don't think so
[03:55:14] <blackspotwiggins> $(document.world).cureCancer();
[03:55:17] <PlasmaBunny> such plugin will also make future unpredictable
[03:55:21] <PlasmaBunny> because everybody will check against it
[03:55:26] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: CHECKMATE
[03:55:28] <PlasmaBunny> and change the future
[03:55:28] <NodeX> PlasmaBunny : the fact that you think a library should do this scares me
[03:55:40] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: that is the reason jquery doesn't have such feature
[03:55:42] <PlasmaBunny> NodeX: what is scaring about it?
[03:55:47] <NodeX> it scares me because you have no grasp of programming
[03:56:05] <NodeX> and you'll probably write an app that will break someone's browser
[03:56:12] <juha_> PlasmaBunny: because the devs of jquery know that if one can see the future, that future stops existing, that's why they didn't implement it
[03:56:37] <NodeX> by merely observing the future you change it - Einstein
[03:57:02] <juha_> NodeX: i received my copy of relativity by einstein today ;)
[03:57:06] <blackspotwiggins> nah they are just fucking with us
[03:57:11] <NodeX> Lol;
[03:57:15] <blackspotwiggins> like how they are screwing everyone with removing ie support
[03:57:21] <blackspotwiggins> they just hate people
[03:57:26] <NodeX> I recieved mine from my Uncle
[03:58:10] <j0rd> anyone know where I can get some slightly fancier drop in effects than fadeIn / fadeOut. Searching Google for "jQuery Effect" turns up too much cruft
[03:58:58] <NodeX> define fancier?
[03:59:07] <blackspotwiggins> micheal bay explosions
[03:59:15] <NodeX> LOL, jquery.com/transformers
[03:59:16] <juha_> blackspotwiggins++
[03:59:38] <NodeX> j0rd: look at the easing functions and build your own - it's easy
[03:59:38] <j0rd> lolz at trolls
[03:59:38] <blackspotwiggins> brb, writing a plugin
[03:59:50] <NodeX> easging.js *
[03:59:53] <NodeX> easing*
[04:00:04] <j0rd> um. a slightly smoother effect. maybe some left to right into a fadeIn / fadeOut
[04:00:27] <j0rd> NodeX: i took a look, that seems to be more "bouncing types"
[04:00:33] <j0rd> NodeX: correct me if I'm wrong
[04:00:47] <NodeX> they do all sorts
[04:01:43] <j0rd> http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/#example
[04:02:07] <NodeX> yep ;)
[04:02:27] <NodeX> then apply the "write your own" part of my comment and you're good to go
[04:02:29] <j0rd> mines for a pretty standard "image slider" but uses fadein fadeout...easing seems to be for changing sizes
[04:03:01] <j0rd> NodeX: I could take a look at them, and create my own, but I assume someone has already done this
[04:03:37] <mc_teo> finally found the answer
[04:04:12] <mc_teo> setup a deferred object, so you know when toggleClass is complete
[04:08:26] <mc_teo> damn, that defered object doesnt work either
[04:08:45] <davetarmac> I have an AJAX form that dynamically changes prices - but in the drop down that does this, there are some prices that are either proceeded by a '+' or '-' depending if there are other price increases or decreases.
[04:08:47] <mc_teo> it just fires as soon as the .toggleClass is executed
[04:08:57] <davetarmac> I need to remove these price increases/decreases
[04:09:38] <davetarmac> I had a script that removed the + by using a split, and I can do the same but for a -
[04:10:17] <davetarmac> the problem I am facing is that the ajax seems to trip this up and overwrites my code when the value of the drop down is changed
[04:11:00] <davetarmac> I think the best thing to do would be to wrap the offending value in spans in the <option>
[04:11:08] <davetarmac> but I do not know how to do this
[04:11:41] <davetarmac> hmm - I might know actually
[04:11:46] <davetarmac> no, I don't
[04:12:27] <davetarmac> in fact, anything I do i going to be overwritten when the drop down changes the prices
[04:12:52] <davetarmac> since I don't have access to the source code
[04:12:53] <ravenz> so you want to append the new values instead?
[04:12:59] <davetarmac> only jquery and css
[04:13:22] <davetarmac> ravenz: I don't know if you can see this, but a link might illustrate it nicer
[04:13:36] <davetarmac> http://www.mooreandmooredesign.com/homebedbath/faux-fur-cushions/faux-fur-cushions/chinchilla-faux-fur-cushion-1065.html#.UDyn2mhYt30
[04:13:40] <ravenz> I am pretty sure it will
[04:13:56] <davetarmac> it's whether it's locked to external viewing though
[04:14:30] <davetarmac> if it worked, you'll see the product page
[04:14:40] <ravenz> i am in
[04:14:50] <davetarmac> there will be a drop down with no prices next to the options in the drop down
[04:15:02] <davetarmac> but if you select one of them, the prices will appear
[04:15:09] <davetarmac> I need a way to get rid of these
[04:15:17] <davetarmac> and like I said, I don't have access to the source
[04:15:59] <ravenz> so you don't want the script to append the price to each option?
[04:16:07] <davetarmac> correct
[04:16:11] <ravenz> but just add/subtract its value to the main price
[04:16:12] <ravenz> ?
[04:16:18] <davetarmac> correct
[04:18:05] <mc_teo> shoky:http://jsfiddle.net/WrDxn/9/
[04:18:08] <mc_teo> finally got it
[04:18:35] <mc_teo> bit hacky, as it depends on how accurate the easing is
[04:20:20] <ravenz> davetarmac and what/where is the code (js) in question?
[04:20:36] <davetarmac> the js that does that, I don't have access to
[04:20:52] <davetarmac> the JS that I wrote to get rid of the +Â£xx.xx is
[04:21:01] <davetarmac> http://jsfiddle.net/aHU3D/
[04:21:03] <ravenz> ok but what is it?
[04:21:08] <davetarmac> that's a crude representation of it
[04:21:21] <ravenz> at least i know what it does
[04:21:27] <davetarmac> since it won't do the refreshing
[04:22:11] <ravenz> does the script you can edit get the data from this spConfig ?
[04:23:08] <davetarmac> nope - all I have access to is a block I can put js in to that is called at the bottom of the page
[04:23:17] <davetarmac> so I've got everything wrapped in a document.ready()
[04:23:27] <guy> I've written this little script to sort tables, https://github.com/anuary/jquery-table-sort. Though, I've ran into problem because with 80,000 rows in a table, it takes 2 seconds to sort the table. What are some tips to optimise it?
[04:24:12] <davetarmac> it's a friggin' mess to be honest, this Magento Go thing
[04:24:21] <ravenz> davetarmac ok but you can maybe prevent the original handler to be executed, and inject your own
[04:24:27] <ravenz> it sucks but it might work
[04:24:39] <ravenz> davetarmac indeed...
[04:24:43] <davetarmac> wow - no idea where to even start with that :)
[04:26:18] <ravenz> it is a pretty simple page, and the cms produce an huge amount of stuffs <o>
[04:27:44] <ravenz> anyway, when a select is updated you could replace the prices with an empty string using a regular expression
[04:28:15] <davetarmac> I didn't think jQuery had regex filters?
[04:29:37] <ravenz> jquery is written in javascript, so you can use the js methods for regex
[04:29:54] <davetarmac> ah right
[04:30:17] <jporcel_> hi there, how can I specify in $.post() the submit name like in a form input name="whatever" ?
[04:30:52] <jporcel_> (special need in prestashop to use if (Tools::isSubmit('submitWishlist')) FYI)
[04:32:00] <adam_lynch> anyone used content sliders containing tables, list, etc. before?
[04:32:04] <adam_lynch> doubt it somehow
[04:32:11] <ravenz> davetarmac something like return htm.replace(/\s?[-|+].[\d|\.]+/, '');
[04:32:15] <seutje> jporcel_: post just serializes the data argument if it isn't a string, so I suppose you could manipulate it before sending it off
[04:32:27] <seutje> ?source post
[04:32:28] <bot-t> Line#6864 - "type = "POST";" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6864
[04:36:47] <davetarmac> ravenz: well that regex working in the first instance, just need to find the original handler
[04:37:48] <ravenz> yup
[04:38:18] <ravenz> otherwise try with this
[04:38:23] <ravenz> ?newContent
[04:38:24] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[04:38:32] <davetarmac> ravenz: balls - it's prototype
[04:38:43] <ravenz> but only if you won't find a way to hook the original handler
[04:42:04] <jporcel_> seutje: what do you mean ? the "data" returned by my callback ? or should I append a "name" attribute or something, just wondering. A little bit noob on .post with jQuery, my need is quite simple. Just simulate the existence of an input type submit with name="whatever"and value"whatever".
[04:42:27] <seutje> I didn't even say "the data returned by your callback"
[04:42:43] <jporcel_> yeap, sorry about that.
[04:43:12] <jporcel_> I don't need to grab the data returned by the call, actually.
[04:43:43] <jporcel_> just do the call likle   $.post(mycarsurl, {mode: "remove", vehicle: vehicle_id}); but using a "input type submit name whatever"
[04:44:01] <jporcel_> so Prestashop can grab it using Tools:: (or I can do a nasty bypass)
[04:44:01] <seutje> so just add whatever: 'whatever' to your data object
[04:44:18] <jporcel_> seutje: ok, so that is how it works. Just wondernig.
[04:44:21] <jporcel_> thanks seutje
[04:44:31] <seutje> no clue what prestashop is though, and double colons scare me
[04:44:50] <jporcel_> prestashop is an ecommerce solution php made
[04:44:59] <seutje> makes me go "unexpected T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM" in my head
[04:45:04] <jporcel_> seutje: jaja
[04:45:06] <jporcel_> right
[04:47:31] <stefuNz> hey. i have page with a button which i can click so that a div box is shown. how can i add an anchor to my page (like index.html#expand) so when i call this page, the box is expanded automatically ? are there plugins or what approach should i use ?
[04:48:45] <davetarmac> ravenz: is there a default event handler for AJAX calls?
[04:49:36] <BlaDe^> is there any performance difference between $('.something, .somethingElse').live('click', ...) vs two separate events/selectors ?
[04:51:01] <ravenz> davetarmac no, but if you have a deferred object you can provide a callback function using the jquery when
[04:53:25] <ravenz> davetarmac something like var populateSelect = $.ajax({}); $.when(populateSelect).done(function () { }) ;
[04:55:37] <davetarmac> ravenz: I'm looking at the whole js for the site now, and it's a mess of all sorts. Don't even know where to start picking it apart
[04:55:59] <davetarmac> the fact that it's minified doesn't help much either :)
[04:56:16] <seutje> BlaDe^: there might be, depending on the case, I think
[04:56:22] <ravenz> eh I know, it is a nightmare
[04:57:37] <seutje> BlaDe^: basically, jQuery will try to define a context (or use document if there is none) and then use .on() with your selector
[04:58:06] <seutje> BlaDe^: so if you split it up into 2 calls, it'll bind 2 handlers on the context which will both fire
[04:58:21] <seutje> BlaDe^: so I think in most cases, the single call will be more performant
[04:58:26] <seutje> if not all
[04:58:48] <shoky> 2 calls instead of 1 is really not the kind of performance you need to be worrying about
[04:59:08] <shoky> if you really cared about performance you wouldn't use .live in the first place
[05:02:35] <seutje> BlaDe^: http://jsperf.com/live-multiple-selectors
[05:04:18] <seutje> I hope that illustrates the difference
[05:07:34] <BlaDe^> yep, thanks seutje
[05:12:45] <venus_> hello, how can i solve jquery issues through firebug
[05:13:11] <venus_> i am using a script to change background position of an image when scrolling page, but it doesnt seem to working
[05:14:02] <kborchers> venus_: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[05:15:10] <seutje> venus_: set a breakpoint in the bit that handles the changing of the background position
[05:15:48] <seutje> then reload, see if it triggers when it should, if so, check the variables within that scope, make sure you have values for the stuff you expect to have values for
[05:22:32] <venus_> i am fairly new to jquery and firebug is confusing me this is the url of the site
[05:22:32] <venus_> http://bmm.websiterocks.com/
[05:23:11] <NodeX> great
[05:49:31] <sjeijk> hi how can i store a variable refresh the page and still have the same variable? Do i need a session for that?
[05:50:03] <mc_teo> sjeijk: or a cookie
[05:50:13] <xec_> mmmmm cookies
[05:50:21] <mc_teo> depending if you care whether the user has access to it
[05:50:47] <sjeijk> i need it to know if a login screen should be open or closed
[05:51:20] <sjeijk> so i was thinking a session would be best
[05:51:42] <mc_teo> yeah, php's sessions stuff is very easy to use
[05:52:09] <mc_teo> remember though, it will be all kept server side
[05:52:10] <xec_> sjeijk: there is no such thing as "session" client-side as far as i know. the closest would be cookies or localstorage
[05:52:30] <sjeijk> then a cookie it will be
[05:53:10] <mc_teo> or make an ajax call to a php script, checking if they are logged in or not
[05:53:26] <mc_teo> depends on a lot of factors
[05:53:40] <mc_teo> there is no one solution for all situations
[05:53:47] <sjeijk> well that would be best, but I'm working with modx cms and my skills aren't good enough to do that :(
[05:54:47] <Luky> Hi, does anyone can tell me whats wrong with my code ?
[05:54:57] <Luky> http://cssdeck.com/labs/jnmvumqi/0
[05:55:00] <pachet> does anyone can see your code---ah
[05:55:08] <Luky> the link
[05:55:14] <Luky> Js part
[05:55:29] <mc_teo> sjeijk: you should have any login mechanism as much server side as possible
[05:55:55] <mc_teo> the whole point of cms is that you don't have to edit it manually
[05:56:20] <xec_> Luky: what are you trying to do?
[05:56:24] <pachet> Luky: remove the 'function' keyword from that parenthetical
[05:56:35] <pachet> 'if($('
[05:56:37] <sjeijk> mc_teo tx for your help, my problem is the design wants a on hover signing screen live actually at http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/learn-more.html
[05:56:38] <pachet> erg.
[05:56:39] <Luky> When the checkbox is :checked the hidden form appear
[05:57:18] <pachet> if ($('#graphs').is(':checked') function){  ---> if ($('#graphs').is(':checked') ) {
[05:57:21] <pachet> Luky^
[05:57:26] <xec_> Luky: so you want something to happen each time the checkbox changes?
[05:57:48] <Luky> yeah
[05:58:12] <sjeijk> but when you have wrong creds at http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/learn-more.html you won't see that error msg unless you hover on sign in again
[05:58:14] <xec_> Luky: then you will need an event listener, on click perhaps
[05:59:17] <Luky> like a name for my function and a "onClick="fade();"
[05:59:29] <pachet> var $graphs = $('#graphs'), $graphskill = $('#graphskill'); $graphs.on('change.mynamespace', function ( ) { $graphskill.fadeToggle($graphs.is(':checked')); });
[05:59:31] <pachet> Luky^
[05:59:54] <Luky> pachet: Thanks !
[05:59:59] <Luky> its pure javascript ?
[06:00:20] <pachet> ?eval typeof jQuery
[06:00:20] <Luky> i mean, that's not jquery ?
[06:00:25] <bot-t> pachet: "function"
[06:00:37] <Luky> oh okay, thanks a lot dude
[06:00:59] <pachet> no sweat
[06:01:16] <Luky> Btw, look around cssdeck.com, its a nice ressource for everyone
[06:01:55] <mc_teo> sjeijk: when you click the submit button on the login form, does it send the page asyncly?
[06:01:56] <MrDup> Hi all
[06:02:00] <pachet> hi
[06:02:00] <mc_teo> or post the whole page
[06:02:13] <sjeijk> nope mc_teo
[06:02:34] <sjeijk> i wish I had the skills to do that
[06:03:00] <mc_teo> what skills
[06:03:26] <mc_teo> its like 5 lines of code copied and pasted from millions of examples online
[06:03:43] <MrDup> I need a selector string that selects input elements that have not any of two classes. How should I write it ?
[06:03:43] <sjeijk> to send the login post to the right controller from modx
[06:05:02] <pachet> !:not() @ MrDup
[06:05:07] <pachet> er..
[06:05:10] <pachet> ?:not()
[06:05:11] <bot-t> pachet, .not() - Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[06:06:27] <miCSu> ain't that just simply :not("input.first-class, input.second-class") ?
[06:06:40] <pachet> MrDup: give this a shot: $('input:not(.foo, .bar)')
[06:07:29] <mc_teo> sjeijk: I'm not familiar with modx cms, but i notice you send a returnUrl parameter to the login script; if using the server side controller you like append "?loginfail=true" or something, which you check for in $(document).ready()
[06:07:34] <pachet> miCSu: yeah, i was fishing for the selector instead of the method, but bot-t is still having his coffee i think
[06:07:44] <MrDup> So, if I write 'input:not([class*=fichier],.newFic)', it must return all input that have no class 'newFic' and no class containing 'fichier'. right ?
[06:07:54] <mc_teo> if you find it, you can then put up a nice error message
[06:10:17] <nemanjan00> hello
[06:10:27] <nemanjan00> is there anyone who can help me?
[06:10:32] <nemanjan00> i have a little problem
[06:10:35] <cusco> maybe
[06:10:40] <cusco> state your problem
[06:11:01] <pachet> MrDup: yeah, that should work
[06:11:07] <nemanjan00> i have problem with ajax update of div
[06:11:11] <laila>  :)
[06:11:12] <nemanjan00> actually with animation
[06:11:25] <laila>  :p
[06:11:33] <nemanjan00> if i load heigher div animation is not ok
[06:11:34] <pachet> MrDup: iirc you can also just do not([.*=foo]) for classes
[06:11:41] <nemanjan00> i will put code on pastebin now
[06:12:07] <nemanjan00> http://pastebin.com/a0ard7ck
[06:12:10] <laila>  8-)
[06:12:32] <nemanjan00> demo: http://nemanjan00.no-ip.biz/bootstrap/
[06:12:50] <nemanjan00> try navigatin between pages and you will see what am i talking about
[06:14:29] <MrDup> pachet: oh, I can use operator like ^=,|= or *= with any kind of test ?
[06:15:13] <MrDup> As for [attr=value] .*=class or #|=id ?
[06:16:03] <MrDup> If I understand well, "." and "#" are just some kind of short tag for class and id ?
[06:17:03] <pachet> MrDup: yeah, as per the css spec for selectors
[06:17:32] <MrDup> Great ! :D
[06:18:49] <MrDup> about my first question, it's all okay.
[06:18:50] <MrDup> Thanks
[06:24:20] <Axsuul> Anyone know how to improve the performance of a full screen fade from a dark overlay
[06:25:01] <mazzachre> How do I disable "return submits whatever form I am currently editing" behaviour? And why is it there in the first place
[06:26:06] <pachet> mazzachre: accessibility, mostly
[06:27:27] <laila>  :)
[06:27:57] <mazzachre> pachet: Well, maybe someone who is a MS windows user finds it normal? I know many MS windows applications do the same thing (return obviously means the user is finished with everything, not with this field only in their world)... My problem is that my users are complaining that this happens, they are used to mainframe...
[06:28:02] <laila>  :(
[06:29:35] <xec_> mazzachre: well, you could make a keylistener that checks if enter is pressed, and then prevent default behaviour
[06:30:10] <pachet> mazzachre: $('form').on('keypress.mynamespace', function ( event ) { if ( event.which !== 13 ) { return; } event.preventDefault(); return false; });
[06:30:13] <arcus_> yeah.. mazzachre, google for it, you will find plenty of examples
[06:30:13] <mazzachre> xec_: That sounds a little extreme... :/
[06:30:26] <arcus_> but hes kinda right
[06:30:28] <laila> gak bisa bahsa inggris
[06:30:40] <MrDup> Another one about my input tags type file : When I clone() a input type file with after I selected a file, the copy doesn't seem to keep file in memory...
[06:30:42] <mazzachre> Hmmm... ok, I will look into it..
[06:31:00] <MrDup> Maybe something I missunderstood about input type file tags...?
[06:31:26] <pachet> MrDup: that's for security reasons
[06:31:44] <pachet> if you clone a file input, the value ( and associated file info ) is reset
[06:31:47] <MrDup> pachet: so, due to clone() method ?
[06:31:56] <MrDup> Okay
[06:32:26] <MrDup> But this reset isn't performed for other types of input ?
[06:32:28] <laila> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm -_-
[06:32:40] <MrDup> like text or radio ?
[06:32:53] <pachet> MrDup: no
[06:33:13] <laila> boleh minta nomer nggak
[06:33:23] <MrDup> pachet: ok, that's why ... ^^
[06:33:35] <laila> pachet
[06:33:36] <MrDup> Thanks again
[06:33:36] <MrDup> =)
[06:34:09] <RawChid> Any idea how I get suggestions of autocomplete after a single click (default is only double click)
[06:34:22] <laila> mrdup

[06:52:54] <Anticom> hi all
[06:53:02] <seutje> hi you
[06:53:13] <Anticom> I'm having trouble with setInterval for a delayed redirect: http://jsfiddle.net/Bqk8b/
[06:53:45] <xec_> interval? for a redirect?
[06:53:57] <Anticom> it say's, seconds in the interval function is undefined... any idea, what's going wrong?
[06:54:02] <xec_> oh you want the countdown
[06:54:07] <Anticom> xec_ just take a look at it... keyword is DELAYED ;)
[06:54:14] <Anticom> yup
[06:54:25] <xec_> Anticom: yeah i just assumed you wanted a setTimeout instead
[06:54:29] <Anticom> nono
[06:54:30] <Anticom> (:
[06:54:55] <Anticom> seconds just doesn't get passed into the function right i think
[06:55:17] <pachet> Anticom: you have seconds declared globally, so dont worry about passing it in
[06:55:26] <xec_> change function(seconds) to function() in the interval callback
[06:55:27] <pachet> jsfiddle.net/Xrws5/
[06:55:31] <Anticom> pachet but it's undefined...
[06:55:47] <xec_> yes, setTimeout is not going to define it as a parameter
[06:55:52] <xec_> err interval
[06:55:59] <pachet> what xec_ said
[06:56:08] <Anticom> oh i see pachet
[06:56:09] <Anticom> thank's
[06:56:32] <gataraid> Is there a way to load a jquery function or active it by declaring #something ?
[06:56:48] <gataraid> I don't know the technical terms for it - sorry
[06:57:00] <pachet> gataraid: yeah, i'm not sure what you mean, can you elaborate?
[06:57:09] <gataraid> right now I have them .mousedown
[06:58:19] <gataraid> But I wanted to activate the same call on a different page that is an achor
[06:59:03] <MrDup> pachet: 'input[type=file]:not(.^=fichier,.newFic)'  <= this one returns an error labelled "Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .^=fichier"
[06:59:08] <MrDup> Something I missed ?
[06:59:47] <seutje> what is .^= suppose to represent?
[06:59:53] <seutje> className starts with?
[06:59:55] <pachet> MrDup: um, i havent used pattern selectors in a while, try using class^= instead
[06:59:59] <MrDup> Yes
[07:00:26] <MrDup> pachet: shouldn't I enclose this test into [] ?
[07:00:27] <seutje> u'll have to use [class^=fichier] but that seems a bit wonky
[07:00:41] <MrDup> Like [class^=fichier] ?
[07:00:48] <xec_> ^^
[07:00:53] <pachet> oh right, sorry
[07:00:56] <gataraid> patchet, I'm not sure if I explained it right or not
[07:01:07] <MrDup> NO problem, I wanted to be sure. =)
[07:01:13] <gataraid> pachet
[07:01:34] <xec_> gataraid: i'm quite confused as to what you mean too - do you have an example?
[07:01:40] <pachet> gataraid: yeah, im still not really sure what you meant, can y---
[07:01:41] <davetarmac> I have some divs and I need to hover over one div and have another appear. I have this working fine - but one for one. Is there a way to loop through dynamically, or do I need different rules for each element?
[07:01:43] <pachet> what xec_ said
[07:01:49] * xec_ hugs pachet
[07:02:11] <seutje> davetarmac: hover over a div and show all the others?
[07:02:29] <davetarmac> hmm - might be better if I knock up a fiddle
[07:02:30] <MrDup> seutje: yes, wonky but running okay. ^^
[07:02:33] <davetarmac> give me a moment
[07:02:45] <xec_> pachet: btw, is your nick pronounced "packet" or "patch-et"?
[07:03:17] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/KtDzf73c - I am trying to call the mousedown some how on a page load
[07:03:25] <gataraid> is there anyway I can call each seperately some how
[07:03:40] <xec_> i always pronounce everything i read in my head, and you're like two people to me because i switch between those :P
[07:03:43] <gataraid> for instance how GET works with PHP
[07:05:23] <MrDup> gataraid: do you want to bind them separatly or to execute your binded function ?
[07:05:26] <gataraid> like if a url was called with #collectivites, the #collectivites .mousedown would be called?
[07:05:45] <gataraid> bind them seperately I think
[07:06:17] <davetarmac> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/bKV82/
[07:06:22] <davetarmac> that's better
[07:06:43] <pachet> xec_: 'patch-et'
[07:06:59] <pachet> why buy a new one when you can pachet back together
[07:07:17] <davetarmac> is it possible to loop through each of these parent divs and apply the jquery stuff, or do I need to have a different rule for each one?
[07:07:26] <xec_> hehe, thanks ;)
[07:07:29] <pachet> :D
[07:07:33] <xec_> now i can breathe!
[07:07:49] * xec_ tries to hide his OCD, unsuccessfully
[07:08:11] <pachet> lol
[07:08:27] <seutje> davetarmac: each of them, or just straight siblings?
[07:09:26] <davetarmac> in that example, there is #div-1 & #div-2. it's all good to have separate rules for each one, I'm just thinking if the client adds something in the future
[07:09:39] <davetarmac> is there a way to deal with this dynamically, or if it's tough luck?
[07:10:26] <guy> I am trying to scan all the table into an array. Though it is taking ridiculously slow (5200ms). https://gist.github.com/d0dacc7867a8049807da
[07:10:35] <guy> is there any more efficient method?
[07:10:49] <xec_> gataraid: let me get this straight. you have a mousedown event handler that fires whenever #collectivites is clicked, and you want that same event handler to fire on document load if "#collectivites" is the current hash in the URL?
[07:11:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know if this tutorial is still up to date? http://justinribeiro.com/chronicle/2009/10/02/jquery-ui-modal-form-with-validation-and-form-plugin-integration/
[07:11:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> seems rather complex way of doing modal dialogs
[07:12:13] <seutje> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/Wskhy/2/ like that? or should the second "show on hover" also show when the first element is hovered?
[07:12:31] <xec_> gataraid: is that correct?
[07:12:39] <davetarmac> no no - that's perfect
[07:12:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need a recent tut on the jquery ui modal dialogs
[07:13:31] <seutje> I guess my class names are a bit silly though, was never good at that
[07:13:49] <pachet> davetarmac: yeah, suetje beat me to it, but i'll post mine as well: jsfiddle.net/54Ckt/
[07:14:10] <pachet> but the gist is the same -- just add a specific class to those elements that you want to use that behavior
[07:14:45] <seutje> y u no http? my client doesn't lemme click those :(
[07:15:03] <pachet> aw, sorry :[
[07:15:08] <davetarmac> both excellent answers
[07:15:17] <seutje> oooh, he's using namespaced events
[07:15:22] <seutje> ++
[07:15:28] <davetarmac> I saw that, I got scared :p
[07:15:51] <seutje> it's actually better
[07:15:59] <davetarmac> what is a namespace?
[07:16:09] <seutje> but doesn't mouseover/out fire for child elements as well?
[07:16:16] <seutje> or is it the other way around, I always forget
[07:16:38] <seutje> davetarmac: it means you'll be able to distinguish these events from other events of the same type
[07:16:56] <davetarmac> ahh right
[07:17:34] <CosmoSRO> generally speaking..does a jcarousel with 25 pics load all at once and then start displaying or is the user able to see something as soon as the page loads and then the remaining pics that didnt display yet continue to load in the background?
[07:19:37] <CosmoSRO> does anyone know?
[07:20:12] <CosmoSRO> so many people in here
[07:20:53] <seutje> haven't used jcarousel in eons, but I assume it would show as soon as enough are loaded and then continues to load in the background
[07:21:03] <seutje> but that's merely an assumption
[07:21:10] <CosmoSRO> ok
[07:21:31] <CosmoSRO> i dont want to set it all up if its going to be a delayed load
[07:26:06] <Cameron_> hello CosmoSRO
[07:26:10] <CosmoSRO> hey there
[07:26:16] <Cameron_> go away
[07:26:17] <CosmoSRO> did u come to answe my ?
[07:26:20] <Cameron_> no
[07:26:23] <CosmoSRO> lol
[07:27:37] <CosmoSRO> so does anyone happen to have any experience with jcarousel to give me a definite answer?
[07:30:32] <CosmoSRO> generally speaking..does a jcarousel with 25 pics load all at once and then start displaying or is the user able to see something as soon as the page loads and then the remaining pics that didnt display yet continue to load in the background?
[07:30:47] <sayakb> hi, i'm trying to implement a behavior where the default button is clicked once the user presses enter in a form using this code: http://paste.kde.org/540698/13461641/ -- the parent('form').first() part returns the form fine, but its not selecting the child, even if i use input[type=submit] and as a result, $default.length is always 0. what am i doing wrong?
[07:31:26] <xec_> CosmoSRO: i don't have a definite answer either, but i assume the same as seutje. it is a trivial thing to test though
[07:31:47] <CosmoSRO> ok...thx for the response
[07:32:34] <davetarmac> hmm - Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[07:33:56] <jedimind> oh shit, now the cops know
[07:34:03] <davetarmac> heh
[07:34:06] * xec_ hides
[07:34:14] <davetarmac> \o/
[07:34:19] <jedimind> don't be token anything illegal
[07:34:29] <manuelbieh> hey
[07:34:40] <xec_> sayakb: what does the form html look like
[07:34:46] <manuelbieh> whats the easiest way to get the "outerHTML" of a node?
[07:34:56] <xec_> node.outerHTML
[07:35:06] <jedimind> basically the way you wrote the question
[07:35:10] <manuelbieh> yeah, but that's not standards compliant is it?
[07:35:10] <sayakb> xec_: http://forum.kde.org/ucp.php?mode=login
[07:35:58] <Clex> sayakb: use html() to debug. $(this).parent().html(), etc.
[07:36:04] <Clex> To see where you are.
[07:36:30] <sayakb> Clex: i did parent('form').attr('action') and the action is indeed correct
[07:36:38] <sayakb> let me try html once
[07:36:46] <djcoin> Hi all - is there a way to make qUnit test result spit test results as xUnit report (xml) ?
[07:36:48] <xec_> sayakb: okay. i don't think your .first() is doing anything, as .parent() will always return a single element
[07:36:59] <davetarmac> ahh
[07:37:06] <sayakb> xec_: i thought so too, but removing it doesnt quite do anything
[07:37:12] <sayakb> as in, same issue
[07:37:12] <xec_> sayakb: second - the submit button is not a child of the form, it is a descendant
[07:37:24] <xec_> sayakb: as in, try .find() instead of .children()
[07:38:09] <davetarmac> is there an equivilent to .on() for 1.5.2?
[07:38:19] <blackspotwiggins> bind?
[07:38:35] <xec_> delegate?
[07:38:44] <shoky> batman
[07:38:53] <xec_> robin
[07:39:03] <shoky> burger
[07:39:07] <xec_> cheese!
[07:39:12] <shoky> baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacon
[07:39:29] * xec_ stops before he hurts himself
[07:39:29] <sayakb> xec_: sweet, that worked! I used -- var $default = $(this).parent('form').find('input[type=submit]').first(); -- thank you :)
[07:40:20] <xec_> sayakb: also, you might not know if the form is the parent (if your html changes in the future) so you might want .closest("form") instead of .parent("form")
[07:40:57] <sayakb> xec_: noted, although it wont change unless i change it :D .. but useful tip, i'll use closest
[07:40:58] <xec_> sayakb: or you can change the selector from "form input" to "form > input"
[07:41:21] <xec_> if you see what i mean ;)
[07:41:35] <sayakb> yep, makes sense :)

[07:52:43] <davetarmac> nm - think I've sorted it
[07:55:22] <zoned_>  i've got a keydown event on an input box, and i want to be able to handle tab being pressed without losing focus of the box. i start the function off with e.preventDefault(), but that isn't doing it

[07:56:28] <tcial> Is it possible to check if an ajax function has occurred?
[07:56:49] <tcial> I've made an extension for Facebook, and I would like it to be called whenever the body of the facebook page is refreshed
[07:57:07] <zoned_> bartmax: same thing
[07:57:13] <LordThumper> tcial: Better check Facebook API documentation
[07:57:28] <tcial> LordThumper: It's not the API. My code executes on the facebook homepage
[07:57:28] <christo_m> can someone take a look at this in chrome? : http://jsfiddle.net/CSSxG/
[07:57:34] <christo_m> the value in the input box won't clear
[07:57:51] <christo_m> In firefox it works fine though.
[07:58:09] <edude03> Hey guys, so I want to catch the submit event and do some stuff before the form submit, so I can it using .on('submit') but when I return at the end of my function the form doesn't submit
[07:58:43] <shoky> zoned_ : return false;  would do it
[07:58:45] <bartmax> christo_m: take a look at : http://robertnyman.com/2010/06/17/adding-html5-placeholder-attribute-support-through-progressive-enhancement/
[07:59:04] <LordThumper> christo_m: When do you want the input box value to clear?
[07:59:09] <bartmax> edude03: don't return anything
[07:59:11] <zoned_> shoky: but then i can't execute any code after the return//
[07:59:19] <LordThumper> When I clicked on the input, the value cleared, and was replaced by a html5 placeholder
[07:59:25] <christo_m> LordThumper, on click
[07:59:26] <christo_m> or focus
[08:00:19] <codacoder> christo: it works first time, but thereafter it breaks - weird
[08:00:26] <christo_m> bartmax: whats weird is that in the article it claims webkit browsers support it
[08:00:30] <edude03> bartmax do I need to prevent default as well?
[08:00:35] <shoky> zoned_: er e.preventDefault() works for me..
[08:00:36] <Spikes> guys, i think i've noticed a bug in jquery 1.8. In some cases when i'm trying to use something like $(element).attr('id'); Instead of returning id, it return object itself. I've tracked this problem to "attr" method which sends arguments.length as a check for chainable
[08:00:41] <christo_m> codacoder: oh it worked even once for you? never has it for me haha
[08:00:44] <christo_m> codacoder: in FF its fine
[08:00:44] <Spikes> Could someone form dev team look into that?
[08:01:06] <codacoder> yep - FF 15 is fine
[08:01:07] <shoky> Spikes: into what..?
[08:01:13] <zoned_> shoky: e.preventDefault allows the box to stay focused even after pressing tab?
[08:01:18] <bartmax> edude03: code is executed before the form acutally submits. If you want the form to do the normal submit, you sohuld not return anything and do not prevent default action (which is submit)
[08:01:18] <ajpiano> Spikes: sounds like you have a plugin that is probably duck-punching methods wrong
[08:01:20] <shoky> Spikes: you didn't say what the problem is and when it happens
[08:01:33] <ajpiano> Spikes: if you believe you have found a bug in jQuery, please file it on the bug tracker, but it sounds like you haven't
[08:01:33] <edude03> OK thanks bartmax
[08:01:42] <Spikes> shoky, check above
[08:02:06] <codacoder> christo: now i cant make it break again - blame sunspots ;)
[08:02:11] <christo_m> hahah
[08:02:14] <christo_m> perfect.
[08:02:20] <Spikes> ajpiano, ok, i'm going to check if there're any plugins interfering, but i really don't think there's any
[08:02:26] <christo_m> i was just sick of doing onclick on blur stuff, so ive been trying to write this script
[08:02:29] <ajpiano> Spikes: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11527 for some context on when this might happen
[08:02:30] <christo_m> for global input blur and focus
[08:02:32] <shoky> Spikes: i did, you said  "in some cases",  "something like".  and that you've tracked the problem to a method..
[08:02:34] <christo_m> and now its like, sorry
[08:03:20] <Spikes> shoky, problem is that attr('id') (or any attr('*')) returns object itself and not the attribute
[08:03:44] <codacoder> christo - it's messed up again - says TestDamnit now
[08:03:49] <shoky> Spikes: when does that happen..?
[08:04:04] <codacoder> christo- file a bug
[08:04:14] <shoky> zoned_: in chrome, yeah
[08:04:26] <christo_m> really??
[08:04:34] <christo_m> how can .val('') be broken?!
[08:04:46] <christo_m> it might be because of placeholder like bartmax said
[08:04:48] <codacoder> i'm on chrome 21.0.1180.83 m
[08:05:09] <Spikes> shoky, i've been looking into what might cause it. There're some plugins active which i believe could affect arguments list, i'm still looing into it
[08:06:16] <shoky> Spikes: ok, it's great that you want the dev team to look into it though.. :\
[08:07:06] <Spikes> what i know for sure is that suddenly arguments list in attr method recieves several undefined arguments (['id', undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]);
[08:07:20] <shoky> suddenly
[08:07:35] <Spikes> Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going at the same time
[08:07:47] <shoky> good luck with that
[08:07:57] <ajpiano> Spikes: are you using tinymce
[08:08:15] <Spikes> ajpiano, yeah, there's an instance being created at some point
[08:08:20] <shoky> heh
[08:08:24] <ajpiano> Spikes: did you read the ticket i sent you
[08:08:33] <Spikes> ajpiano, not yet
[08:08:38] <ajpiano> you should probably do that
[08:08:39] <ajpiano> cause it says like
[08:08:52] <ajpiano> that TinyMCE has a duckpunch that breaks attr
[08:08:59] <Spikes> ajpiano, it's 1.7.2 version and i haven't had any problems with it
[08:09:34] <ajpiano> you're using tinyMCE version 1.7.2 ?
[08:10:31] <Spikes> 1, sec, going to check
[08:10:35] <christo_m> tinymce breaks in 1.8
[08:10:36] <christo_m> i know that
[08:10:53] <ajpiano> cause um, the bug in tinymce was in like 3.5.something beta, and the current version of tinymce is 3.5.6, and i think if there was ever a 1.x series of tinyMCE looking through the tags here that would be at least 7 years old
[08:10:54] <christo_m> otherwise id be using the brand new shiny framework
[08:11:52] <codacoder> christo - clue - first click goes to left of Test - second goes to end of Test - wtf?
[08:12:37] <Spikes> ajpiano, so, i've been using tinymce with 1.7.2 without any problems, it appeared after i switched 1.8
[08:12:48] <ajpiano> which version of tinymce
[08:12:52] <tcial> Is it ok to use an .on callback for every event possible?
[08:13:17] <Spikes> major version: 3, minor 4.4
[08:13:26] <ajpiano> please upgrade your tincy
[08:13:28] <ajpiano> tinymce
[08:13:31] <Spikes> Ok, thanks
[08:13:45] <ajpiano> the bug that was in tinymce was until like 3.5.2 if i recall correctly
[08:14:35] <Spikes> been sitting whole day without internet trying to figure out why the hell half of the app wasn't working correctly
[08:15:11] <ajpiano> always good to debug edge case bugs in 3rd party open source libraries without google or anything
[08:16:11] <codacoder> christo - if you remove all your code and remove the value="Test" in the HTML, it works fine
[08:16:24] <Spikes> I just couldn't wrap my mind around the fact that tinymce could torture attr method so much
[08:16:28] <codacoder> less is more
[08:16:58] <vict0ria> hello
[08:17:32] <christo_m> codacoder: lol wat
[08:17:44] <codacoder> true
[08:17:59] <christo_m> codacoder: it goes to the right because it reputs the word Test
[08:18:02] <codacoder> unless, you had other plans for it, it works as a placeholder dshould work
[08:18:17] <vict0ria> anyone ever worked with drupal theming and implementing some menu.js with superfish? I cant make it work like in this example (top menu): tinyurl.com/9mcf285
[08:18:47] <zoned_> shoky: ok, i got it working. i forgot i was throttling the keydown function, and that was screwing it up. however, now that i've done this, shift+tab won't work :-/
[08:19:31] <codacoder> christo - what was your js meant ot achieve?
[08:20:22] <shoky> zoned_: what doesn't work about it?
[08:20:42] <christo_m> codacoder: allow gracefulness for older browsers
[08:20:49] <christo_m> but i guess bartmax already linked me some pretty solid stuff
[08:21:28] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm having a problem with my jquery. for some reason the bind('click', handler) binds the handler twice. I'm pretty sure the bind() gets called only once, because i log smth right before it, but the handler itself gets called twice(and it's a toggle, so that defeats the whole purpose of the bind)
[08:21:37] <codacoder> cool - I think your code should have been using prop in some places but if you have some better code, sure, go with that
[08:22:28] <christo_m> http://robertnyman.com/2010/06/17/adding-html5-placeholder-attribute-support-through-progressive-enhancement/
[08:22:46] <shoky> ?p @ walidvb
[08:22:47] <bot-t> walidvb, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:22:48] <christo_m> codacoder: it looks like it only supports one element at a time
[08:22:58] <christo_m> lmao, what i just realized is my code does work
[08:23:03] <christo_m> i just dont do a check if placeholder works in the browser
[08:23:12] <christo_m> because webkits the only engine thaht supports it, it was actually working
[08:23:53] <walidvb> https://gist.github.com/8f089d1f3a402084ad84
[08:23:58] <codacoder> what about modernizr?
[08:31:17] <cimsco> hello. i would like to click on one element and toggle the visibility status of another element (with a nice CSS3 transition effect); here http://jsfiddle.net/SPkHx/1/ clicking the blue element should make the red box rotate in and out, but is not working correctly; what am i doing wrong?
[08:32:49] <shoky> cimsco: you have $('#sliideIn')
[08:33:10] <Palanivel> Hi Hi...............I have json object like "var a = { "abc" : {"name" : "xyz"},{"name" : "fgh"},{"name" : "lkj"} } from here i wan to read name one by one(loopin)..........may i know how?????????? if am using array list means...i am getting but object how ill do???????????? any idea?????????
[08:33:15] <shoky> cimsco: also.. its much nicer to use css classes for that..
[08:34:22] <cimsco> shoky: sorry for the typo; that's not causing the problem, though; yes, classes would probably be better, but this id-based setup, should work, too, somehow, right?
[08:34:58] <shoky> cimsco: also.. why are you checking visibility==hidden?
[08:35:03] <shoky> because it's not..
[08:35:14] <cimsco> isn't it?
[08:35:22] <cimsco> toggle does not alter visibility?
[08:35:25] <xec_> cimsco: also, you don't need to re-select the same element over and over. in the handler it is available as "this"
[08:35:39] <shoky> cimsco: no it'll alter display
[08:35:42] <shoky> i think.
[08:35:53] <cimsco> xec_: sure, not really causing the animation, though
[08:36:13] <xec_> no, i'm just saying, it's a lot easier to debug clean code
[08:36:37] <cimsco> xec_: that's a quick testcase
[08:36:40] <shoky> also you set up an event handler inside another event handler..
[08:36:51] <shoky> on every click you're registering more
[08:37:05] <shoky> er
[08:37:25] <Eviltwin> In other words, this would never have worked right.
[08:37:54] <xec_> .toggle(func) isn't an event handler
[08:38:09] <shoky> it's not?
[08:38:12] <xec_> it just shows/hides and calls the func when its done iirc
[08:38:17] <shoky> nuh uh
[08:38:27] <xec_> .toggle(func, func) however..
[08:38:38] <shoky> hm
[08:38:51] <cimsco> http://jsfiddle.net/SPkHx/3/ still not, it's something about the animation that i'm doing wrong, probably
[08:39:10] <shoky> forgot that toggle could take duration/callback
[08:39:13] <Palanivel> @xec.......any idea about my question
[08:39:17] <shoky> screw you xec
[08:39:24] <xec_> xec++
[08:39:26] <cimsco> xec_: .toggle(func, func) does not work here since i'm clicking on element A and alter the state of element B
[08:39:56] <xec_> cimsco: yeah i was just correcting shoky's statement. he hates that
[08:40:00] <xec_> ;D
[08:40:05] <cimsco> 'show' is never logged to console, why is that?
[08:40:18] <someprimetime> because it just sets a css property i believe
[08:40:25] <someprimetime> to display: block;
[08:40:26] <xec_> because visibility is never hidden
[08:40:36] <wilornel> hey guys, is it possible to have an event handler which checks for dynamically added content?
[08:40:38] <someprimetime> or that
[08:40:38] <xec_> you can try .is(":visible") instead
[08:40:40] <shoky> cimsco: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/SPkHx/4/
[08:40:43] <shoky> yep ;p
[08:40:46] <xec_> or something like that
[08:40:53] <shoky> sorry, i changed moz to webkit
[08:41:01] <shoky> actually no, im NOT SORRY.
[08:41:09] <xec_> rofl
[08:41:10] <someprimetime> lol
[08:41:13] <cimsco> shoky: that's not animating at all
[08:41:23] <shoky> cimsco: it is for me. did you change back to moz :P
[08:41:28] <xec_> classic
[08:41:28] <cimsco> oh, webkit, sorry
[08:42:05] <xec_> cimsco: like i stated earlier though, .toggle() will hide (or show) and *then* fire the callback
[08:42:15] <xec_> cimsco: so that approach is never going to slide it out
[08:42:26] <cimsco> shoky: ok, seems to work better
[08:43:27] <cimsco> i never got the vendor prefixes thing, it's like dog-doo on the pavement - it's guaranteed that you will step into it
[08:43:53] <cimsco> xec_: that is right, alternatives?
[08:44:11] <xec_> yeah, don't toggle xD
[08:44:21] <xec_> moment, fiddling ;)
[08:46:05] <tgg> Hi, do you offer support for issues with custom scripts made with jquery?
[08:46:44] <cimsco> tgg: show it, maybe someone will help you, use jsfiddle or something similar
[08:47:44] <xec_> cimsco: http://jsfiddle.net/SPkHx/5/ closer?
[08:48:17] <xec_> class name should be "show", rather, but you get the basic idea?
[08:48:29] <cimsco> xec_: you sure you forked right?
[08:48:39] <xec_> yes, opened in chrome? :D
[08:49:15] <PKKid3> ohh god thats an annoying animation. :D
[08:49:59] <tgg> I have a jquery mouseover action that shows text when you go over the photo/bio area of one of the people on the page, the problem is that it doesnt work with multiple hovers: http://tinyurl.com/9ckfvuk
[08:50:34] <xec_> cimsco: try this http://jsfiddle.net/SPkHx/6/
[08:50:52] <cimsco> xec_: oh, you moved everything to css, i see
[08:50:58] <PKKid3> tgg, Not what the bug is here, you want a mouseover to work on all the poeple?
[08:51:00] <xec_> yeah, i'm a css guy :D
[08:51:01] <cimsco> works in chrome
[08:51:10] <cimsco> xec_: which makes a lot more sense
[08:51:58] <xec_> origin should really be moved from the class to the original id too btw
[08:52:10] <tgg> PKKid3: yes, right now it only works with 1, it seems the predecessor gets disabled and the next one i add works
[08:52:15] <xec_> makes it easier to see just what is being animated by the class
[08:52:40] <cimsco> xec_: and it makes javaScript really only handle the events
[08:53:21] <tgg> should I just duplicated the js and make trigger1, trigger2 etc?
[08:53:29] <xec_> indeed. will also work without the animation on older browser (seeing as it is the top property which is hiding it now)
[08:53:45] <xec_> browsers*
[08:55:32] <cimsco> xec_: give me a moment
[08:56:00] <PKKid3> tgg, Drop an example into jsfiddle, and we can more easily help out
[08:56:36] <sjeijk> how can i check what my form posts
[08:56:56] <sjeijk> console.log($_POST['username']); this isn't working
[08:57:44] * xec_ cries
[08:58:28] <cimsco> xec_: hey, i was distracted, ok?
[08:58:39] <cimsco> xec_: well, thanks for the help, it is working perfectly fine now
[08:58:53] <cimsco> it is even the 'clean' solution that i was intending to implement
[08:59:01] <xec_> cimsco: i wasnt crying because of you, i was crying because sjeijk is mixing js and php code
[08:59:17] <sjeijk> :(
[08:59:34] <tgg> wow what an amazing website
[08:59:34] <xec_> sjeijk: i cry easily ;)
[08:59:38] <sjeijk> am crying all day
[08:59:40] <tgg> PKKid3:  http://jsfiddle.net/xYf95/
[09:00:14] <sjeijk> learning jq the pain in ass way
[09:00:19] * cimsco smells php in the air and shudders
[09:00:39] <xec_> cimsco: anyway, you're welcome :) again :)
[09:01:24] <cimsco> xec_: i should really use more css classes
[09:01:36] <slick-> I'm trying to call a function on click
[09:01:36] <PKKid3> tgg, THat seems to be missing you're JS?
[09:01:38] <slick->  loadFrame is not defined
[09:01:41] <slick-> it keeps saying that
[09:01:42] <slick-> :(
[09:01:57] <slick-> this is the code
[09:01:58] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/WrS4k/
[09:02:30] <cimsco> xec_: it limits work: 1) less js 2) even less js/css when fiddling with old browsers; don't know if that is generally true, but for this sort of visual bling, it is, i think
[09:02:31] <tgg> PKKid3: what? you dont see any JS? that's strange it's there for me...
[09:02:47] <PKKid3> tgg, Save is again and send the link
[09:03:20] <cimsco> xec_: one problem remains, though; the slide in box is not hidden!
[09:03:40] <xec_> cimsco: no i just put it outside of viewport
[09:03:43] <tgg> PKKid3: ok try http://jsfiddle.net/xYf95/2/
[09:03:43] <cimsco> so what if it was meant to appear in the center of the screen? mess around with z-index?
[09:03:53] <PKKid3> tgg, thats better
[09:04:01] <tgg> PKKid3: sorry about that ;>
[09:04:04] <cimsco> xec_: or fiddle with opacity?
[09:04:14] <PKKid3> tgg, OK, so this works for both people on my screen
[09:04:34] <slick-> any idea why it keeps saying 'loadFrame is not defined '
[09:04:35] <xec_> cimsco: if you want different properties to be animated at different stops (say show before rotate and rotate back before hide) you need to fiddle around with keyframes
[09:04:40] <slick-> when i have defined the variable
[09:04:41] <slick-> on the page
[09:04:41] <PKKid3> tgg, Ahh, they both show Daniel
[09:04:41] <cimsco> cimsco: will not work if there are form elements in the box etc.; so the question remains: how to toggle the visibility of an object with animations?
[09:05:18] <xec_> lol did you just talk to yourself? am i that bad company? xD
[09:05:23] <xec_> cimsco: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/@keyframes
[09:05:29] <cimsco> xec_: keyframes, urgh
[09:05:44] <cimsco> cimsco: sorry
[09:05:56] <cimsco> ;)
[09:06:19] <PKKid3> tgg, OK, so the first problem here is you are using IDs multible times on the same page.  D's are indexes to allow faster lookups, but that means they also need to be UNIQUE (only one per page)
[09:06:25] <PKKid3> ID's*
[09:06:50] <PKKid3> so, change 1: update those id="pop-up" lines to class="pop-up"
[09:07:25] <tgg> ok
[09:07:47] <PKKid3> tgg, Same for trigger
[09:08:05] <tgg> ok
[09:09:13] <tgg> PKKid3: http://jsfiddle.net/xYf95/3/
[09:10:13] <ven0m> question: if i use fadeOut on <object> (youtube video) it looks like the object is being unloaded since its JS methods become unavailable. When i do fadeIn - how can i know the object is ready to use again?
[09:10:16] <PKKid3> tgg, http://jsfiddle.net/xYf95/2/
[09:10:43] <tgg> v3 is with id changed to class
[09:11:05] <wilornel> guys is there an event handler which checks for dynamically added elements?
[09:11:13] <PKKid3> tgg, The third problem is you are not selecting the popup RELATIVE to the a.trigger.  By use $(this).next() I am forcing it to use the Dom element immediatly after the A that is being hovered.
[09:11:49] <tgg> ok, I sort of understand
[09:12:27] <PKKid3> tgg, Basically $(this) is the a.trigger element
[09:12:43] <PKKid3> tgg, more specifically, its the exact one you are hovering.
[09:12:57] <tgg> ok
[09:13:11] <wilornel> sooooooooooo... does anyone know of an event handler which checks for dynamically added elements?
[09:13:34] <wilornel> Actually I am trying have an event handler which checks for the popup bubbles in google maps
[09:13:38] <PKKid3> tgg, But a generic line like $('div#pop-up').show(); will actually show ALL div#pop-up elements on the page.  They were actually all being displayed on top of eachother
[09:13:55] <tgg> hmm ok, that makes sense
[09:14:01] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/GxhPH1La - this works fine for two of the values but one does not for some reason
[09:14:10] <gataraid> dyna_entreprises
[09:15:06] <gataraid> for some reason it shows collectivites and entreprises
[09:15:15] <gataraid> the other two work
[09:16:46] <wilornel> guys is there an event handler which checks for dynamically added elements?
[09:17:25] <mikepj1> you can trigger a custom event when you add elements
[09:17:29] <mikepj1> and then just listen to that
[09:17:36] <wilornel> hmmm
[09:18:11] <wilornel> actually, what I trying to do is add an event handler for when the popup bubbles in google maps appear
[09:18:29] <mikepj1> i think those have callbacks built into them
[09:18:35] <mikepj1> i forget though
[09:19:06] <sorahn> anyone know why window.innerHeight and $(window).innerHeight() return different values?
[09:19:11] <wilornel> let me check
[09:19:45] <wilornel> sorahn: $(window) is a jquery object, window is a DOM object,  I think thats the difference, I am not sure thgouh
[09:19:56] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/GxhPH1La - this works fine for two of the values but one does not for some reason
[09:21:12] <wilornel> gatarid: What you just said makes no sense...
[09:21:12] <sorahn> actually, innerHeight says not to use it on $(window) however, $(window).height() was giving me the wrong value too :\
[09:21:35] <tgg> PKKid3: i'm not sure what to do next
[09:21:39] <Eviltwin> gataraid: I believe you want else ifs there
[09:22:11] <wilornel> sorahn: did you check the documentation? http://api.jquery.com/innerHeight/
[09:23:03] <caddoo> What is the easiest way to add keyboard navigation to a table
[09:23:06] <gataraid> elseif instead of if?
[09:23:12] <sorahn> yea, like i just said, .height() was returning the wrong value, so i was trying to use the innerHeight function, but that doesn't work either. so i have no idea whats wrong.
[09:23:15] <caddoo> so pressing the key down goes through the rows and highlights them
[09:23:26] <gataraid> sorry wilornel
[09:24:01] <gataraid> two of the values work fine in the function
[09:24:08] <gataraid> but one doesn't for some reason, #dyna_entreprises
[09:24:13] <gataraid> dyna_entreprises
[09:24:53] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/GxhPH1La
[09:25:10] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ gataraid

[09:30:29] <ven0m> question: if i use fadeOut on <object> (youtube video) it looks like the object is being unloaded since its JS methods become unavailable. When i do fadeIn - how can i know the object is ready to use again?
[09:30:52] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ ven0m
[09:30:52] <bot-t> ven0m, Try It And See
[09:31:04] <Eviltwin> Or don't fadeOut / fadeIn an <object>
[09:31:25] <ven0m> Its a video in a lightbox
[09:31:35] <ven0m> i need to fade it in/out
[09:31:52] <Eviltwin> Can you <div><object/></div> and fade the <div>?
[09:32:01] <ven0m> try what and see? if i'd know a solution to that, i wouldnt ask. I've tried .load() but it had no effect
[09:32:12] <ven0m> Eviltwin - thats what i am doing
[09:32:22] <ven0m> the effect is exactly the same
[09:32:30] <Zeph88> How is it that some sites are able to prompt the browser to go full screen?
[09:32:31] <ven0m> if i would fadein/out the object it self
[09:33:00] <Eviltwin> ven0m: Can you make a demo of this so I can see what's happening?
[09:33:12] <ven0m> NP. GIve me a sec
[09:33:32] <nemanjan00> hello
[09:33:40] <nemanjan00> does anyone have time to help me?
[09:33:52] <wilornel> guys, I just wanted to know if this would be correct: var selector = $('#id');
[09:33:55] <entrada> nemanjan00: what'syour question?
[09:33:55] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ nemanjan00
[09:33:56] <bot-t> nemanjan00, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:34:12] <entrada> wilornel: yes
[09:34:18] <vudu> Hi, did anyone attend the meeting yesterday?
[09:34:18] <elgreg> wilornel: your variable name is odd, but yes.
[09:34:33] <nemanjan00> http://pastebin.com/a0ard7ck
[09:34:42] <nemanjan00> thats my code
[09:34:56] <nemanjan00> it works ok when i load smaller code in div
[09:35:17] <wilornel> elgreg: heh ^^, next when I do setTimeout(selector +".parent.css({'margin':'-15px'})", 100); why doesnt it work?
[09:35:18] <nemanjan00> but when i load bigger code in div effect does not work ok
[09:35:42] <Eviltwin> wilornel: Holy shit
[09:35:45] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ wilornel
[09:35:45] <bot-t> wilornel, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:35:45] <elgreg> wilornel: because $("#id") returns a jquery element
[09:35:59] <elgreg> wilornel: which you are trying to concat with a string
[09:36:01] <nemanjan00> http://nemanjan00.no-ip.biz/bootstrap/
[09:36:05] <nemanjan00> this is example
[09:36:12] <entrada> wilornel: lol put that in a function
[09:36:18] <nemanjan00> navigate to register and then back to home to see problem
[09:36:41] <Eviltwin> wilornel: When you're using setTimeout or setInterval, always, always, always use setTimeout(function() { ... }, ...)
[09:36:43] <entrada> wilornel: then stop using the plus symbol for whatever you're using it for
[09:36:49] <Eviltwin> And put actual JavaScript code in that function
[09:36:52] <wilornel> oh okay
[09:36:58] <Eviltwin> Never use the setTimeout("...", ...) form
[09:37:11] <Guest41160> Does anyone know if Jquery 1.8.1 is being released tomorrow or Thursday?
[09:37:16] <wilornel> eviltwin: I used jquery with setTimeout before, it worked
[09:37:20] <entrada> wilornel: also, you cannot concatenate functions and expect them to work
[09:37:35] <wilornel> thanks entrada
[09:37:43] <Eviltwin> wilornel: Always use setTimeout(function() { ... }, ...), never use setTimeout("...", ...)
[09:37:50] <Eviltwin> wilornel: I don't care what you've done before
[09:37:54] <Eviltwin> Never use that second form again
[09:37:55] <wilornel> Yes
[09:38:04] <wilornel> Thanks
[09:38:29] <nemanjan00> is anyone going to help me?
[09:39:01] <ajpiano> Guest41160: are you asking as though you heard it would be one of those two days? i don't believe it's going to be that soon
[09:39:04] <Eviltwin> nemanjan00: Depends on how polite and patient you are
[09:39:19] <Guest41160> http://jquery.org/updates/ had potential release this week
[09:39:27] <Guest41160> I'm looking at it because of this bug:

[09:40:40] <Guest41160> So I'm hoping this bug will be included in the 1.8.1 release and that it will be in the next day or 2, but the road map is out of date
[09:40:42] <nemanjan00> Problem: Effects on changing div do not work well
[09:40:52] <Guest41160> Eviltwin: No, he had help.  nemanjan00 hadn't though
[09:40:55] <wilornel> eviltwin: Yeah I waited for some other question for like 20 mins
[09:41:10] <wilornel> I had some other question taht had been left unanswered
[09:41:10] <nemanjan00> please people
[09:41:14] <wilornel> yes
[09:41:16] <wilornel> what is it?
[09:41:20] <nemanjan00> i am trying to solve it for whole day
[09:41:26] <wilornel> let me help you
[09:41:26] <ven0m> Eviltwin - http://jsfiddle.net/borislit/ynuMT/
[09:41:29] <ven0m> sorry it took time
[09:41:32] <Eviltwin> wilornel: Someone just explained why you can't do setTimeout(obj + ".parent.css...", ...)
[09:41:33] <ajpiano> Guest41160: got a definitive "Hopefully" from dave, but there are still some blockers left
[09:41:42] <ven0m> ther are 3 buttons there
[09:41:44] <wilornel> eviltwin: Thats not the question I was talking about
[09:41:48] <ven0m> fadeOut the video
[09:41:50] <Eviltwin> wilornel: I just explained that you should always use setTimeout(function() { ... }, ...)
[09:41:54] <Guest41160> ajpiano: what's the general turn around on google CDN updated after your release?
[09:41:56] <ven0m> than click Play - and youll see the error
[09:42:11] <Eviltwin> wilornel: If you have a specific question, ask it
[09:42:18] <ajpiano> Guest41160: sometimes they do it really quick, sometimes it takes a little longer
[09:42:22] <ven0m> Run it in chrome to see the effect clearly
[09:42:22] <wilornel> Eviltwin: yes, I know. Oh and btw the: selector.parent().css(); is not working
[09:42:40] <wilornel> it only works when it is: $('#id').parent().css();
[09:42:45] <Guest41160> Okay thanks for your time. I appreciate it :)

[09:47:17] <nemanjan00> <nemanjan00> Problem: Effects on changing div do not work well
[09:47:21] <Eviltwin> ven0m: It's kind of sidestepping the problem
[09:47:24] <entrada> perfect nemanjan00
[09:48:08] <nemanjan00> ?
[09:48:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok, but this still gives an empty string: classnamedefault = $("#classname_default_1").text();
[09:48:30] <ven0m> Eviltwin - that doesnt seem to work at all (at least in fiddle/chrome)
[09:49:06] <entrada> ecky--ptang-zoob: does the DOM element exist?
[09:49:24] <Eviltwin> ven0m: Huh, it's working in Chrome for me
[09:50:09] <ven0m> the video doesnt fade here
[09:50:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> idaoh nvm, got it
[09:51:20] <ven0m> My question is - what actually happens to the object when it disappears? is it unloaded? if it is, how can i know if its loaded already?
[09:51:39] <Eviltwin> I don't think it's unloaded technically
[09:51:44] <Eviltwin> But it does become unavailable to you
[09:52:12] <ven0m> i've tried using .load() on it
[09:52:14] <ven0m> but it didnt work
[09:52:53] <ven0m> although it didnt work for img when i tried it in other example
[09:53:18] <Eviltwin> Well I don't think it's reloading
[09:54:30] <ven0m> Any theories on the process? :X
[09:55:59] <MistuhKurtz> ven0m, what kind of object?
[09:56:07] <MistuhKurtz> javascript has a garbage collector
[09:56:18] <MistuhKurtz> that should automatically clear out unused objects
[09:56:44] <Eviltwin> I suspect that as an optimization when Flash discovers it's not visible, it doesn't bother to render anything
[09:56:50] <Eviltwin> And also disconnects from JavaScript
[09:57:03] <Eviltwin> As long as the Flash is even partially visible, you should be able to access those methods
[09:57:04] <cimsco> is there a way to use .animate() and '-prefix-transform' in combination?
[09:57:18] <ven0m> MistuhKurtz, its a youtube video
[09:57:32] <cimsco> or anything like pseudo properties like 'scale', 'rotate', 'transform' etc.?
[09:58:16] <MistuhKurtz> cimsco, I feel like I've seen a plugin that extend's jquery's native animate methods to use CSS3 transforms
[09:58:18] <ven0m> Eviltwin, sounds logical
[09:58:24] <invisib> Hey guys, I'm trying to set the background color of each of my buttons to the class of that button but it's not working as expected. Anyone care to show me what I'm doing wrong?    $('#g_swatches button').css('background', '#' + attr('class'));
[09:58:36] <ven0m> the question is - is it possible to monitor those states
[09:58:40] <slick-> hey guys, I'm trying to load a function on click
[09:58:47] <slick-> but it keeps saying unknown function
[09:58:49] <Eviltwin> ven0m: Doubt it :\
[09:59:01] <slick-> Uncaught ReferenceError: loadFrame is not defined
[09:59:06] <cimsco> MistuhKurtz: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/ ?
[09:59:10] <MistuhKurtz> invisib, why not just style the class with that background?
[09:59:16] <elgreg> slick-: got a code? jsfiddle, etc?
[09:59:23] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/WrS4k/
[09:59:30] <slick-> the crazy thing is
[09:59:31] <invisib> slick-: Try $('a.myclicky').click(function() { alert('hi'); }
[09:59:33] <slick-> it works in jsfiddle
[09:59:36] <MistuhKurtz> there's also this cimsco http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[09:59:40] <MistuhKurtz> idk which one is more mature
[09:59:40] <invisib> MistuhKurtz: Needs to be dynamic :)
[10:00:13] <MistuhKurtz> invisib, I still have a hang-up with the way you're approaching this. It's kind of messy. But I'll tell you why it's not working
[10:00:20] <MistuhKurtz> attr() is a method of the jquery object ($)
[10:00:31] <MistuhKurtz> and you don't have $ in there
[10:00:39] <cimsco> MistuhKurtz: i wonder if there is a sane plugin-less way to do it
[10:01:00] <MistuhKurtz> invisib, you could do this
[10:01:01] <elgreg> slick-: The only thing I can think of is that your loadFrame function isn't in the global scope in your non-jsfiddle version
[10:01:09] <yen_> how can one make a regular post pagination <!--nextpage--> (it breaks posts into multiple pages) into an ajax jq pagiination?
[10:01:19] <elgreg> try taking it off the onclick attribute and using an event
[10:01:42] <keirlav87> can anyone please help with my problem - I'm trying to append an indeterminate number of <th>'s to a table contained jquery object on the fly - i've made a fiddle of the problem here - http://jsfiddle.net/BrP38/9/
[10:01:52] <yen_> elgreg me?
[10:02:22] <invisib> Got it with this: http://pastie.org/4604684
[10:02:29] <invisib> :)
[10:02:36] <MistuhKurtz> $('#g_swatches button').css('background', function(){ return # + $(this).attr('class'); });
[10:02:39] <ravenzz> yen_ what that means? do you have one big bace with <!--nexpage--> in it?
[10:02:40] <elgreg> slick-: http://jsfiddle.net/elgreg/wVCSZ/
[10:02:51] <ravenzz> big page*
[10:02:58] <elgreg> yen_: sorry - not you.
[10:03:03] <MistuhKurtz> invisib, but what if your elements need to have other classes?
[10:03:19] <invisib> They don't
[10:03:20] <MistuhKurtz> invisib, I would recommend at least using a data-* attribute, like data-color="#FFF"
[10:03:21] <slick-> elgreg: thank you sir
[10:03:27] <invisib> Good idea
[10:03:36] <invisib> Thanks MistuhKurtz :)
[10:03:41] <MistuhKurtz> np
[10:03:48] <yen_> ravenzz no its for splitting long posts in multiple pages
[10:03:50] <elgreg> yen-: you might have more luck in a wordpress forum - and or if you have more information on what plugin your using. Gotta run.
[10:04:04] <ravenzz> yen_ but stick it is one page?
[10:04:28] <MistuhKurtz> and using a function to set the attribute, like I wrote, is a little more succinct and clear than looping over the elements
[10:04:38] <MistuhKurtz> and probably more efficient
[10:04:41] <invisib> MistuhKurtz: Is my method efficient or do you think your's is better?
[10:04:51] <yen_> ravenzz the code is in the post page now
[10:05:12] <ravenzz> can you show me an example?
[10:05:24] <yen_> sure
[10:05:59] <slick-> still getting loadFrame is not defined
[10:06:30] <MistuhKurtz> invisib, I feel like what I wrote would be more efficient, but at the same time I'm inclined to believe either way would still be looping/iterating over each element and applying the style, working the same way in the end. So whatever you find reads better I suppose
[10:06:55] <yen_> http://goo.gl/mktDw (this is a test site so don't worry abt anything else) ravenzz
[10:07:47] <yen_> ravenzz this is how the regular pagination works
[10:08:25] <cimsco> can i use keyframes to chain different CSS3 transformations? e.g. first scale element by .5 for 1s, then (as soon as the first animation is over) scale the same element by 1.3 for 2s?
[10:08:32] <yen_> look at the url, it shows page 2,3, etc ravenzz
[10:08:38] <invisib> MistuhKurtz: Cool, thanks for the help
[10:08:52] <ravenzz> yen_ ok and?
[10:09:14] <yen_> and i wanna make it into a jquery, ajax pagination.
[10:09:18] <yen_> wanna see any example?
[10:09:29] <alanjhogan> Is there an ETA for when 1.8.1 might be released?
[10:10:09] <ravenzz> yen_ what do you think about this http://www.infinite-scroll.com/ instead ?
[10:11:02] <yen_> ravenzz thats a good idea but will it load a "new" page"
[10:11:11] <ravenzz> no
[10:11:22] <ravenzz> only the new articles
[10:11:39] <ravenzz> /pages
[10:11:55] <yen_> yeah thats fine but wll it change the URL...but look seamless
[10:12:22] <ravenzz> it won't change the url
[10:12:38] <yen_> i need it to
[10:12:41] <yen_> :-s
[10:12:58] <ravenzz> so take a look at history.js
[10:13:09] <yen_> whats that?
[10:13:34] <keirlav87> if I have a jquery html object that is a table, and a data object, and I want to loop through the object and append a <th> for each key in the data object, how would I do something like that if TR that the TH's are going into are not top level of the jquery html object?
[10:13:49] <keirlav87> or would I have to create an object containing my TH's first, then append that to the TR when I get to it?
[10:14:04] <ravenzz> yen_ https://gist.github.com/854622
[10:15:00] <yen_> so will this use something like infinte scroll but load a new page view?
[10:15:24] <ravenzz> it is another thing
[10:15:47] <yen_> what does it do ravenzz?
[10:16:42] <ravenzz> yen_ read this https://github.com/balupton/history.js
[10:18:00] <yen_> here is what i want to achieve, but without using a slideshow (these guys are using a slideshow) http://goo.gl/XTA0q ravenzz
[10:19:21] <slick-> anyone know why I'm getting an 'unexpected token' http://jsfiddle.net/WrS4k/
[10:21:51] <ravenzz> yen_ so ask on #wordpress for some plugin or if you have no clue on how it can be done hire someone on #css-lance for example
[10:22:41] <yen_> ravenzz i wanted to know if you know a way to ajaxify a pagination.
[10:23:13] <elgreg> slick-: did you notice that in my jsfiddle I removed the onclick attribute?
[10:23:14] <ravenzz> yes i do
[10:23:24] <slick-> yeah?
[10:23:44] <yen_> how can it be done? can u help? ravenzz?
[10:24:07] <yen_> i have the doc u sent me before, but that seems that it another solution. although i will read ot.
[10:24:19] <elgreg> slick-: just making sure. Also, unexpected token is usually something like amissing paren. You might want to run your code through jslint.
[10:24:32] <slick-> oh
[10:24:40] <ravenzz> if you want the url to change it could be a bit complicated, considering that you are still asking me.
[10:24:50] <slick-> elgreg: when i rule your code
[10:24:50] <slick-> i get this
[10:24:51] <slick-> Uncaught ReferenceError: loadFrame is not defined
[10:25:16] <ravenzz> otherwise take a look at this http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments
[10:25:36] <pachet> yen_ : have your server report what the page range is, build buttons in javascript based on that range, highlight the current one, bind a click event handler to each one querying the server for the data within that page range
[10:26:00] <pachet> use window.history or the link ravenzz linked to modify the current url without forcing a redirect
[10:26:19] <yen_> pachet this link http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments ?
[10:26:25] <elgreg> slick-: I get no error when I run this: http://jsfiddle.net/elgreg/wVCSZ/
[10:26:26] <Arkns> hi all. everyone nice? so... $.ajax - is there a way when calling have success/done retrieve the data result (in my case a json)?
[10:26:33] <pachet> no, history.js
[10:26:35] <slick-> :(
[10:26:37] <slick-> this sucks
[10:27:11] <yotmv> Arkns: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[10:27:14] <pachet> Arkns: sure, the success parameter gets passed the data as its principal argument
[10:27:44] <pachet> $.ajax({ url : 'foo', success : function ( data ) { /* do stuff with data */ }});
[10:28:06] <pachet> technically speaking, that's the response, but
[10:28:24] <yen_> what do history.js do exactly?
[10:28:27] <yen_> pachet
[10:28:37] <Arkns> pachet: I know and I already see link to yotmv. but there is a way to pass to a member of my module?
[10:28:52] <invisib> Hey guys, how do I fade something out, and whenever that animation is complete, fade something else in?
[10:28:55] <invisib> I suck at callbacks
[10:29:07] <Arkns> too*
[10:29:34] <pachet> yen_ : from the link, if you'd read it, "History.js gracefully supports the HTML5 History/State APIs (pushState, replaceState, onPopState) in all browsers"
[10:29:46] <pachet> yen_ : pushState is the one of particular interest to you, i'd think
[10:29:56] <Eviltwin> invisib: $("#foo").fadeOut(400, function() { $("#bar").fadeIn(); })
[10:30:18] <shoky> keirlav87: why does it matter if its top level or not?
[10:30:21] <invisib> Thanks Eviltwin
[10:30:28] <yen_> will this work pachet: http://goo.gl/6cUyP
[10:30:35] <tgg> Can anyone help make this javascript work with multiple mouse overs? right now its a script for just one but I do not know enough to make it use multiple triggers http://jsfiddle.net/xYf95/2/
[10:31:22] <pachet> Arkns: um sure, just call some function within that success callback, and throw in that data argument
[10:31:27] <Eviltwin> tgg: You can only use an ID once
[10:31:49] <slick-> elgreg: thank you so ugh for ur help
[10:31:53] <pachet> Arkns: or you could just assign the 'success' property to whatever function reference you want, be it some property on some module or something, or whatever
[10:31:58] <slick-> i pasted the javascript in a file and it works!
[10:31:59] <slick-> yay
[10:32:54] <shoky> tgg: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xYf95/4/
[10:33:21] <pachet> yen_ : *shrug*
[10:34:09] <Arkns> pachet: oka. I try here
[10:45:12] <walidvb> I have this weird behavior when binding a click event: the callback is called twice, for some reason. the bind() is only called once.
[10:45:29] <walidvb> i've been on that for hours, now, and i'd love to have some insight
[10:45:42] <shoky> walidvb: more code or info that what you've given is needed..
[10:45:52] <shoky> walidvb: because your paste looked ok
[10:46:12] <shoky> walidvb: got a live site?
[10:46:34] <walidvb> http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[10:46:54] <walidvb> shoky: clicking the project link should open/close the list. hovering out as well.
[10:47:51] <walidvb> shoky: it does the same for every click event from that script.
[10:53:21] <walidvb> shoky: any clue?
[10:54:15] <MaxymiserTE> Is there a core jquery function (or javascript) that can count and insert a span after 25 lines. (a line is not a \n it is where the text wraps to the next line.) I'm stuck since i can't check for \n characters
[10:54:31] <MaxymiserTE> I will need to put a random image after every 25 lines so this is the reason why i ask
[10:54:41] <pachet> what happens if they resize
[10:54:44] <pachet> and the linebreaks shift
[10:55:46] <pachet> cricket chirp
[10:56:02] <MaxymiserTE> we'll get to that after we solve this
[10:56:19] <MaxymiserTE> and it won't resize because the DIV is fixed
[10:56:35] <pachet> they can still scale up their fontsize
[10:56:37] <pachet> !
[10:56:46] <MaxymiserTE> so you dont know?
[10:57:30] <pachet> clone the container, throw in characters until the innerHeight changes
[10:57:39] <pachet> pretty awful though
[10:57:57] <MaxymiserTE> yeah i thought of that
[10:58:43] <MaxymiserTE> also the only way to count by character equivalent would be if the letter spacing was exactly the same
[10:59:24] <MaxymiserTE> not too worried about scaling since we just need to code for a normal font size (100%)
[11:02:07] <walidvb_> shoky: did you have a chance to take a look at my live link?
[11:02:26] <slick-> hey slight problem
[11:02:33] <slick-> i wanna be able to activate the js when i click on the link
[11:02:39] <slick-> it auto loads though with this code
[11:02:40] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/elgreg/wVCSZ/
[11:02:41] <slick-> with any link
[11:03:21] <shoky> walidvb_: yeah i think i just found the prob.
[11:03:35] <walidvb_> shoky: that would be sweeeet ;)
[11:03:37] <shoky> walidvb_: you're including some wipetouch script, which triggers another click
[11:03:51] <shoky> in response to some onTouchEnd event
[11:04:25] <walidvb_> shoky: that is indeed the source of the error
[11:05:04] <shoky> groovy
[11:05:17] <walidvb_> shoky: do you know how this should handled?
[11:05:32] <yotmv> slick- you could change from $('a') to $('#mydiv').next() if your link is always the next sibling to the div
[11:05:43] <shoky> walidvb_: i have no idea what this script does.. so my current suggestion is: dont use it ;)
[11:06:04] <shoky> walidvb_: or: learn how to properly use it ..
[11:06:09] <walidvb_> hehe. my client wants mobile support
[11:06:16] <walidvb_> shoky: but will do.
[11:06:20] <walidvb_> thanks for your help
[11:06:26] <shoky> np
[11:06:26] <walidvb_> ps: how did you debug that?
[11:06:47] <sjeijk> can jquery see what a form sends if it sends with ajax
[11:06:51] <shoky> by putting a breakpoint in the click handler
[11:06:56] <shoky> and looking at the stack trace
[11:07:07] <shoky> saw that wipetouch stuff
[11:07:18] <shoky> looked inside and saw .trigger("click")  ;)
[11:07:27] <pachet> yuck
[11:08:01] <pachet> wipeslap
[11:08:47] <walidvb_> shoky: great. could I prehaps bind a namespaced event?
[11:08:52] <walidvb_> pachet: got a better plugin?
[11:08:55] <shoky> heh
[11:09:21] <shoky> walidvb_: that wouldn't help i think
[11:10:17] <nemanjan00> hello
[11:10:19] <nemanjan00> i am back
[11:10:26] <nemanjan00> can someone help me now?

[11:10:37] <nemanjan00> <nemanjan00> Problem: Effects on changing div do not work well
[11:12:00] <nemanjan00> anyone?
[11:12:41] <pachet> walidvb_: have you tried disabling the 'useMouseEvents' option :[
[11:13:19] <walidvb_> pachet: nope. haven't tried debugging the wipetouch yet, to be honest, as i didn't know that was the problem
[11:13:29] <walidvb_> but i'll try.
[11:13:36] <walidvb_> thanks for your help, brb
[11:15:03] <shoky> nemanjan00: why isn't the .fadeIn()  inside the .load ?
[11:15:37] <nemanjan00> becouse load loads external page
[11:16:12] <shoky> nemanjan00: .load returns immediately
[11:16:28] <nemanjan00> yes
[11:16:28] <shoky> nemanjan00: so it'll fadeIn as soon as the fadeOut finished
[11:16:45] <shoky> newheight is 0
[11:16:58] <nemanjan00> how should i change code?
[11:17:56] <nemanjan00> problem is fadein starts before animation
[11:18:04] <nemanjan00> i want to wait animation to be finished
[11:18:19] <nemanjan00> but if i wait for it to be finished div does not change
[11:18:37] <nemanjan00> u understand?
[11:19:05] <shoky> nemanjan00: the php response is empty..
[11:19:22] <nemanjan00> not for pages home and register
[11:19:29] <shoky> oh.
[11:19:34] <shoky> you might've mentioned that
[11:19:38] <nemanjan00> i didnt entered anything in contact and about
[11:20:39] <arcus_> well nemanjan00: u need to fade out the page, then just disable visibility on the other, slide it down and then fade in
[11:20:50] <shoky> nemanjan00: ok then what do you want to happen? fadeOut, then load php, then animate height, then fadeIn ?
[11:20:51] <arcus_> at least.. thats what i think you wanna do
[11:21:02] <nemanjan00> yes
[11:21:24] <arcus_> okay
[11:21:27] <shoky> nemanjan00: then move the fadeIn inside the load callback:   $(this).animate( {height: newheight}, 500).fadeIn("slow")
[11:21:40] <nemanjan00> tryed
[11:21:48] <nemanjan00> it does not work
[11:21:54] <shoky> er
[11:21:54] <nemanjan00> height do not change
[11:22:00] <shoky> that doesnt make sense tho
[11:22:13] <shoky> if its faded out, why animate the height .. ?
[11:22:32] <shoky> so, what effect do you want?
[11:22:52] <shoky> what, the height changes fine..
[11:23:12] <nemanjan00> becouse i want footer to move
[11:23:30] <nemanjan00> my problem is that it fade in before animation is done
[11:23:31] <shoky> fadeOut -> load -> fadeIn -> animate height  ?
[11:23:35] <nemanjan00> before height change
[11:23:41] <nemanjan00> nah
[11:23:54] <shoky> ??
[11:23:57] <nemanjan00> fadeOut -> load -> animate -> dadeIn
[11:24:06] <shoky> but if its faded out
[11:24:08] <shoky> its NOT VISIBLE
[11:24:10] <nemanjan00> fadeIn*
[11:24:12] <shoky> why animate it??
[11:24:22] <nemanjan00> becouse i want to move footet
[11:24:25] <shoky> you wont see the animation, because its not faded in yet
[11:24:26] <nemanjan00> footer*
[11:24:26] <shoky> ..
[11:24:35] <shoky> oh.
[11:24:39] <shoky> think i got you
[11:25:38] <shoky> i think you want instead of the fadeOut and fadeIn , to animate opacity to 0 and 1
[11:25:47] <shoky> because fadeOut also sets display:none
[11:25:51] <shoky> hmm
[11:26:15] <shoky> actually you'd need something else
[11:29:00] <nemanjan00> fixed it
[11:29:00] <nemanjan00> :)
[11:29:34] <nemanjan00> added $mydiv.css('display', "block"); in fade out
[11:30:05] <nemanjan00> thank you a lot
[11:30:26] <shoky> heh i didnt help much
[11:30:26] <nemanjan00> i didnt know fadeout set display to none
[11:30:33] <shoky> o
[11:30:34] <Eviltwin> Yup
[11:30:35] <shoky> ;]
[11:31:10] <yen_> shoky whats the best way to make a regular post pagination into ajax pagination?
[11:31:19] <shoky> derp
[11:31:24] <shoky> donno man ;]
[11:31:36] <yen_> WOman :-)
[11:31:46] <shoky> sorry lady
[11:31:56] <yen_> http://goo.gl/mktDw  this is a link, u can see the pagination appended to the end of the article.
[11:32:23] <yen_> the regular pagination loads the entire page, i wanna be able to use jquery to load the page more seamlessly.
[11:33:10] <yen_> shoky
[11:33:43] <nemanjan00> whats best way to validate form in javascript?
[11:34:11] <nemanjan00> i know validating mail with regex and everithing
[11:34:14] <shoky> yen_: well.. you can bind to the links click events (using .click for example) and there do event.preventDefault() on the event argument, and then do the ajax requests
[11:34:17] <nemanjan00> but i need password rating
[11:34:40] <gkatsev> nemanjan00: https://tech.dropbox.com/?p=165
[11:34:43] <yen_> shoky will the URL still generation new pages like page 1/page 2 etc
[11:34:48] <yen_> generate*
[11:35:04] <shoky> yen_ those are generated?
[11:35:20] <slick-> hey guys
[11:35:21] <slick-> $(document).ready(function(){
[11:35:22] <slick->     $('a').on('click', loadFrame);
[11:35:28] <slick-> is making all links on the page activate javascript
[11:35:32] <slick-> how can i make only one link do it?
[11:35:39] <yen_> i mean, curretly when we click on the pagination a "new" page loads. will that still happen with ajax?
[11:35:43] <yen_> shoky
[11:36:00] <yen_> we want that.
[11:36:17] <Eviltwin> slick-: Which link to you want to have do it?
[11:36:40] <slick-> so here
[11:36:41] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/elgreg/wVCSZ/
[11:36:49] <slick-> any link on the page seems to activate the javascript
[11:36:53] <slick-> i wanna do something like onload
[11:36:55] <shoky> yen_ you can do that yeah but i dont know much about it.. with pushState / history.js /bbq/ whatever
[11:37:10] <yen_> right.
[11:37:30] <ravenzz> yen_ 3 people have been told you how it can be done
[11:37:44] <Eviltwin> slick-: ...then do onload?
[11:37:50] <slick-> ok got it
[11:37:51] <yen_> yeah i think i got it. i wanted 2 opinion.
[11:37:55] <ravenzz> if you have spent this time to read the links I gave to you
[11:37:56] <yen_> thanks ravenzz
[11:38:06] <yen_> yeah i am reading :-)
[11:38:11] <ravenzz> you could have been done probably
[11:38:31] <yen_> thanks for the help guys!
[11:38:37] <ravenzz> yw
[11:40:20] <yen_> :-)
[11:40:34] <yen_> thanks shoky
[11:42:01] <shoky> >:-{D
[11:43:01] <yotmv> slick- do you want the link to activate when it's clicked or when the page is loaded? also, your current code  sets events on all links because you aren't targetting just one thing or even a subset, but all of them, there's a couple ways you could fix that
[11:43:25] <yotmv> you could add a class to the link that matters & grab then bind to that -> http://jsfiddle.net/wVCSZ/4/
[11:44:01] <yotmv> you could also find the div & then go next (though it's a pretty bad idea) like this => http://jsfiddle.net/wVCSZ/5/
[11:51:11] <sjeijk> Can some1 explain me why if I send a form with php i can pass
[11:51:14] <BarisW> Hi all. Suppose I point to a page with an anchor (locations.html#location1), how can I give #location1 a background-color? Thus.. how can I fetch the given anchor in jQuery?
[11:51:17] <sjeijk> oops
[11:51:35] <sjeijk> not finish typing arch...
[11:52:40] <sjeijk> Can some1 explain me why if I send a form with php i get good results, but when i do it with ajax i don't get any result
[11:53:22] <Spikes> what do you mean by "good results"?
[11:53:55] <pajo> is it wise to create "deep" elements like $('<div><div><div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div>') or is there a better way for that?
[11:54:58] <pajo> will it work fast enough to be usable and such?
[11:55:37] <sjeijk> well spikes I'm sending [username] and [pwd] but when I send it without ajax to the receive.php page the variables get passed, but with ajax they dont
[11:56:01] <Spikes> pajo, doubt you'll notice difference unless you're creating a lot of elements.
[11:56:07] <NoiseEee> sjeijk: perhaps you are sending via GET while your script expects POSTed things, or vice-versa?
[11:56:48] <sjeijk> this http://pastebin.com/4vNJHz3R is how the ajax call should look right?
[11:57:09] <pajo> probably up to 20 elements from json array, but i hate the createelement() method to do that (code gets too messy)
[11:57:34] <ravenzz> BarisW the same page right?
[11:57:40] <BarisW> yes
[11:57:44] <Spikes> sjeijk, what's in console? Especially in POST params?
[11:58:05] <ravenzz> BarisW did you mean something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/DQHZr/
[11:58:06] <sjeijk> an object
[11:58:07] <BarisW> ravenzz: I want to link to a page from the front page and then highlight the selected item
[11:58:29] <sjeijk> o, post is json
[11:58:42] <sjeijk> {"success":false,"message":"â¦ etc
[11:59:00] <NoiseEee> when i have a single element with the class .foo,   should i bother $('.foo').first().something()   or just $('.foo').something()   ?
[11:59:00] <BarisW> ravenzz: not actually. But I found that I might be able to use window.location.hash
[11:59:38] <BarisW> $(window.location.hash).addClass('highlight');
[11:59:46] <Spikes> sjeijk, i mean what's in the POST parameters when you're sending data to the server. Do they look correct?
[12:00:47] <ravenzz> BarisW acutally the css :target pseudoclass would work
[12:01:00] <sjeijk> i would love to know how i can check what I'm sendingâ¦ afaik I check it in the php file with $_post[â¦] and then if I don't use ajax i see vars i wanna see, with ajax i dont
[12:01:08] <ravenzz> so you can do that without js
[12:01:10] <Spikes> sjeijk, what browser do you use?
[12:01:15] <sjeijk> safari
[12:01:34] <sjeijk> but have firefox and chrome also
[12:01:42] <Spikes> sjeijk, right click on the page and Inspect element
[12:01:49] <BarisW> ravenzz: never heard of that, cool
[12:01:49] <BarisW> thanks
[12:01:53] <sjeijk> ok
[12:02:00] <Spikes> sjeijk, then network tab
[12:02:21] <sjeijk> ok
[12:02:48] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Is this valid syntax? $('#creditcard_ccexpm').val($('#cardexpiry #dk_container_expiry_year .dk_toggle .dk_label').val());
[12:02:58] <Spikes> then send form to the server and when new element on the left list appears click on it
[12:03:56] <Spikes> sjeijk, that should open details of that request on the right side. Look for "Form Data" and check if data you're sending is correct
[12:04:30] <Spikes> sjeijk, you can also do that with firefox, but you'll need Firebug plugin for that (one of the best Web Dev plugins)
[12:04:35] <Drager> Guys
[12:04:40] <Drager> How can I make this code: <script>$.get(String.fromCharCode(117,115,101,114,95,105,110,102,111), function(e) { alert( $(e).find(String.fromCharCode(46,116,97,98,108,101,45,99,111,110,100,101,110,115,101,100)).html() ) });</script>
[12:04:47] <Drager> To submit on load instead of alert?
[12:04:53] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: yes
[12:04:58] <sjeijk> i think i can't find the file as in i think it doesn't get send correct
[12:05:18] <jrockjiggz> Drager: that is happening on success callback from ajax response
[12:05:32] <Drager> jrockjiggz: What do you mean?=
[12:05:34] <Spikes> sjeijk, uh, what?
[12:06:16] <jrockjiggz> Drager: your question is confusing.. the code happens on load...
[12:06:21] <sjeijk> the file I use in my ajax call is 'getlogindata.html' but i don't see that file in the network files
[12:06:38] <Drager> jrockjiggz: Yeah, but I want it to submit a form instead of an alert box
[12:06:58] <Spikes> sjeijk, ah, did you submit the form? It won't appear until you submit form
[12:07:21] <sjeijk> I'm not sure if it gets submitted
[12:07:33] <sx> I'm having a hard time understanding why anyone would ever use the .ajaxSuccess method. Wouldn't it be better to just trigger functions as callbacks in .get, .post, .ajax ?
[12:08:02] <Spikes> sjeijk, any errors in console? last tab in web inspector (what you just opened)
[12:08:04] <sjeijk> spikes it's live at http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/learn-more.html under the login button
[12:08:15] <Drager> jrockjiggz: You understeand?
[12:08:24] <sjeijk> no errors
[12:09:53] <Spikes> sjeijk, page reloads. Apparently code doesn't catch submit event
[12:10:45] <NoiseEee> for sure sx
[12:11:14] <Spikes> sjeijk, replace first line with: $(".loginLoginForm").on("submit", function(e) {
[12:11:48] <invisib> Hey guys, I'm having some troubles with .click()... I can click on an element and sometimes it will trigger the click evt... sometimes it won't.
[12:12:00] <NoiseEee> var xhr = $.ajax({etc});  xhr.done = function() { } is for sure the way to go nowdays sx
[12:12:07] <sjeijk> done
[12:12:26] <invisib> Also, it seems to trigger if I move my mouse slightly in any direction
[12:13:18] <sjeijk> spikes should that 'getlogindata.html' appear in the network files list?
[12:13:19] <sx> NoiseEee: yeah that seems better since it gives the ability to deal with the xhr status
[12:13:29] <invisib> Yeah, it pretty much doesn't work if I click the same exact spot over and over (it's not being covered up by another div or anything), but if I move my mouse slightly it works
[12:13:30] <invisib> :(
[12:13:56] <Spikes> sjeijk, it appears. Works for me
[12:14:13] <Spikes> sjeijk, and sent data is correct
[12:14:26] <FrozenFire> For some reason, my selector isn't working: $("#config select[name=type]") I have also tried quoting "type" with both single and double quotes. Any idea as to why this might be?
[12:15:09] <Spikes> FrozenFire,  $('#config select[type="name"]')
[12:15:30] <FrozenFire> Spikes, Nah. It's definitely the name attribute
[12:15:39] <Spikes> Ah, hmm
[12:15:55] <FrozenFire> <select name="type">
[12:16:18] <sjeijk> thanks spikes!
[12:16:22] <Spikes> tried running console.log with it inside?
[12:16:29] <Spikes> sjeijk, no problem
[12:16:47] <ak> $('#config select[name="type"]')  FrozenFire
[12:16:56] <Spikes> FrozenFire, maybe you don't have #config?
[12:16:56] <FrozenFire> ak, Tried that
[12:17:03] <FrozenFire> Spikes, I definitely do
[12:17:09] <FrozenFire> I also tried just plain select[name=type]
[12:17:14] <FrozenFire> Without filtering for #config
[12:17:15] <ak> FrozenFire: the selector is good, then you have a problem with the markup
[12:17:18] <Spikes> FrozenFire, weird
[12:18:14] <FrozenFire> http://pastebin.com/HEPDqduG Here's an abridged version of the form
[12:18:33] <invisib> jsfiddle foo!
[12:18:51] <invisib> Stop wrapping select in label
[12:18:51] <ak> FrozenFire: why do you think the selector is not working?
[12:19:23] <FrozenFire> ak, I placed a console.log both in the event handler I'm binding, and also tried an each()
[12:19:35] <invisib> use <label for="myselector">My label</label><select id="myselector">...</select>
[12:19:41] <FrozenFire> invisib, Why?
[12:19:50] <invisib> Label shouldn't wrap should it?
[12:19:53] <FrozenFire> Yes, it can.
[12:19:57] <FrozenFire> It's entirely valid markup
[12:20:05] <invisib> Meh, probably screwing with jquery's head
[12:20:10] <invisib> Try it my way and see if it works
[12:20:12] <BarisW> Would it be possible to divide a bunch of alinea's into multi-column alineas and split them by <hr>s? So <p>Text</p><br /><p>More text</p><hr /><p>even more text</p> Would end up in a three column text?
[12:20:17] <ak> FrozenFire: http://jsfiddle.net/keriati/EfDhQ/     it works for me
[12:20:19] <FrozenFire> http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/label
[12:20:30] <Spikes> FrozenFire, http://jsfiddle.net/f6BuV/
[12:20:32] <invisib> ak: works for me too
[12:20:35] <Spikes> works too
[12:20:44] <FrozenFire> Very weird...
[12:20:54] <invisib> Maybe you have a virus?
[12:20:57] <FrozenFire> :P
[12:20:59] <invisib> :D
[12:21:11] <invisib> Anyone know why my crappy button won't click consistently?
[12:21:23] <Spikes> FrozenFire, a ghost in your code
[12:21:33] <tgodar> making an Xhr post at a set interval on a page.  After the session has expired though the request returns a 401.  The behavior I want to avoid is having that result in an HTTP style authentication dialog popping up.  How do I go about that?
[12:21:42] <Spikes> FrozenFire, what's your jquery version?
[12:21:47] <FrozenFire> I tried the equivalent of that in my code, ak, and it didn't work o.O
[12:22:00] <Spikes> FrozenFire, any plugins?
[12:22:08] <invisib> http://mscns.webfactional.com/transfers/ex/
[12:22:16] <invisib> Try clicking on the down arrow
[12:22:27] <FrozenFire> Spikes, 1.7.2
[12:22:28] <invisib> Works sometimes, doesn't sometimes
[12:22:36] <FrozenFire> And I do also have JQuery Tools loaded
[12:24:19] <FrozenFire> This is completely weird...
[12:24:45] <Spikes> FrozenFire, i'd disable any plugins beside jquery and try again.
[12:25:06] <Spikes> FrozenFire, otherwise check very carefully markup around the form
[12:25:11] <tgodar> now that's kinda goofy, if I toss an alert('foo') into the error: callback of the call it does the alert and never shows the HTTP authentication dialog.
[12:26:29] <Spikes> invisib, wery weird code. Down button is part of the list that has binds on it. Probably why it's acting like that.
[12:27:04] <invisib> How to fix?
[12:27:09] <FrozenFire> Okay, that's *extremely* werid.
[12:27:10] <FrozenFire> weird**
[12:27:15] <FrozenFire> I cannot select that select at all
[12:27:22] <invisib> trying to do .on() instead of .click() so it binds right or something
[12:27:27] <monk12_> hey all, quick question mostly for theoretical purposes. I just thought it would be cool to shorten typing '> console.clear();' to just typing '>cc' on the FireBug console. Is there anyway to do it theoretically? I thought maybe defining a global '> cc = function (){ console.clear(); };' and then can just call '> cc();' ... it works... but anyway to just make it work with '>cc'?
[12:27:39] <shoky> invisib: it's because it's a <button>, it happens when you drag-click
[12:27:49] <shoky> invisib: drag-clicking on buttons doesn't register as a click
[12:27:49] <ThaDick> bricker88: The to_date worked â¦ Thank you!
[12:27:51] <Spikes> FrozenFire, check markup
[12:28:03] <shoky> or, doesn't always
[12:28:03] <invisib> shoky really? So use an anchor and it works eh?
[12:28:13] <Eviltwin> monk12_: Not without modifying the actual code of the console itself
[12:28:26] <Eviltwin> But some already have a keyboard shortcut for clearing the console
[12:28:28] <invisib> yep works fine
[12:28:29] <Eviltwin> So you may want to look into that
[12:28:38] <invisib> shoky: Thanks bro. Nice set of knowledge you got on you
[12:28:48] <monk12_> k, thanks Eviltwin.
[12:29:11] <FrozenFire> Spikes, Markup's valid per the W3C validator
[12:29:16] <FrozenFire> And I even tried removing the label
[12:29:43] <FrozenFire> This is very, very weird.
[12:29:48] <shoky> invisib: i actually only experienced that with jquery UI buttonsets before. i thought regular buttons were fine with it
[12:30:16] <shoky> but even here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/yPeqA/  when you drag-click quickly it doesnt register
[12:31:27] <invisib> shoky: Actually broke again
[12:31:47] <invisib> Refresh page to see <a> version still broke
[12:31:48] <Spikes> I don't think it's button related. I tried clicking very fast. Still same problem
[12:31:57] <invisib> Spikes: Yeah you're right
[12:32:09] <invisib> Spikes: Where do I start?
[12:32:28] <FrozenFire> Apparently JQuery doesn't like my form *at all*
[12:32:39] <FrozenFire> I tried console.log($("#config"));
[12:32:40] <FrozenFire> Nada
[12:32:56] <FrozenFire> console.log($("form"));
[12:32:57] <Spikes> FrozenFire, markup, totally markup
[12:32:58] <FrozenFire> Nada
[12:33:07] <Spikes> invisib, gimme a sec
[12:33:15] <engaged> is there a way to submit a form in a child window?
[12:33:16] <FrozenFire> Spikes, It's valid.
[12:34:26] <Spikes> FrozenFire, you could try creating static html with that form to test what might be wrong
[12:34:35] <FrozenFire> Spikes, It is static HTML
[12:34:42] <FrozenFire> And I've run it through the W3C validator
[12:34:42] <shoky> invisib: it's clicks surrounding the arrow that dont work, when they're on the <a> but not on the <img>
[12:35:00] <FrozenFire> Only issue it produces is a warning about a missing character encoding attribute
[12:35:17] <FrozenFire> What the hell.
[12:35:24] <FrozenFire> console.log($("body"));
[12:35:25] <FrozenFire> Nada
[12:35:40] <shoky> actually no, donno
[12:35:57] <invisib> Works fine with .mousedown
[12:36:09] <invisib> I think it was because my buttons "push in"
[12:36:17] <Spikes> FrozenFire, running your code in $(document).ready(function() { code her });??
[12:36:20] <invisib> Because of that it was waiting for a full click event to happen
[12:36:37] <defaultro_> hey folks, what is wrong with this? It's not calling my saveClick.
[12:36:38] <defaultro_> form.find('#saveButton').bindFirst("click", {}, saveClick);
[12:36:41] <invisib> Because it was pushing in, the click wasn't ending in the same spot it started in (almost like a click-drag or something)
[12:37:00] <FrozenFire> Spikes, Le sigh. Thanks.
[12:37:00] <defaultro_> saveButton does exist and right letter case
[12:37:01] <FrozenFire> :P
[12:37:14] <FrozenFire> Ordinarily I do that.
[12:37:42] <FrozenFire> But I've started writing JQuery stuff in a (function($) { ... }) (jQuery);
[12:37:45] <defaultro_> <button class="btn-xsmall localize" id="saveButton" style="display: inline;">Save</button>
[12:37:53] <FrozenFire> And that made me not thing to do it in a ready event
[12:37:59] <FrozenFire> think**
[12:38:16] * FrozenFire slinks away in shame
[12:38:16] <FrozenFire> :P
[12:38:23] <Spikes> FrozenFire, happens. Reason why i use ready :)
[12:38:43] <engaged> is there a way to submit a form in a child window?
[12:39:02] <invisib> Oh I'm a cool guy
[12:39:11] <invisib> Thanks for the help broskis
[12:39:36] <defaultro_> hey folks, did you see my post? It's because it's just now that I identified myself to nickserv
[12:40:34] <Spikes> engaged, var child = window.open(blah blah); Then you could try running something like $(child).find('form').submit(); Not sure it'll work, though;
[12:40:51] <engaged> do you think it will?
[12:41:14] <pppaul> i want to find all of the contenteditable elements on the page
[12:41:15] <Spikes> enbergj, not sure
[12:41:22] <Spikes> engaged, but woht trying
[12:41:27] <Spikes> worth*
[12:41:41] <engaged> is it possible to submit a form from a different site from my site?
[12:41:44] <pppaul> one of my elements that i suspected wasn't contenteditable, says 'inherit' when i do $.prop('contenteditable') on it
[12:42:08] <Spikes> engaged, no
[12:43:00] <jamesdotnet> defaultro_: Your question did show up. What is bindFirst?
[12:43:49] <Spikes> engaged, unless other site does not recognize your website with something like document.domain = 'your domain';
[12:43:52] <defaultro_> i'm not sure where my colleage got it
[12:44:02] <defaultro_> he wrote it but he's on vacation for a week :(
[12:44:14] <defaultro_> maybe simialr to bind
[12:44:55] <jamesdotnet> defaultro_: There seems to be a plugin for that, but that's not the syntax
[12:45:15] <defaultro_> he's got working on the other js file
[12:45:19] <defaultro_> and it's different
[12:45:33] <defaultro_> on the other code, he didn't call the function, He wrote the code itself
[12:45:42] <defaultro_> for this one, he is calling saveClick
[12:45:52] <defaultro_> so maybe, that is causing the issue
[12:50:22] <defaultro_> this worked :)
[12:50:26] <defaultro_>         form.find('#saveButton').bindFirst("click", {}, function(e) {             alert('some text');         });
[12:50:40] <defaultro_> it doesn't support calling function
[12:51:44] <defaultro_> I will try this, this should work
[12:51:46] <defaultro_>         form.find('#saveButton').bindFirst("click", {}, function(e) {             saveClick();         });
[12:58:27] <defaultro_> it worked

[13:04:43] <snowinferno> Hi all, I'm using jquery 1.7.2 from google cdn and attempting to make a $.get call. In Chrome's developer tools network tab I see the request is made and it returns exactly what I expect it to return however the callback I supplied to $.get is never called. Does anybody have an idea of what the problem is?
[13:05:13] <lrvick> Hey if I want to remove the last 2 children from parent1, and then prepend them to parent2, what is my shortest path in jquery?
[13:05:18] <pppaul> my $.prop('contenteditable') is returning inherit on everything, even the body. though i only set it on a single div (leaf node) $.attr('contenteditable') behaves properly
[13:05:22] <lrvick> having touble locating the most appropriate tool

[13:12:55] <TelFiRE> Hey all. Any way to animate to height 0 and then animate back? I know slide toggle does this, but it hides overflow elements.
[13:13:03] <TelFiRE> I tried animating to "auto" and that seems to not work
[13:13:36] <bartmax> ? last
[13:13:36] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[13:14:05] <bartmax> maybe you should use find(':nth-last(2)')
[13:14:10] <bartmax> ? nth-lasat

[13:14:39] <bartmax> TelFiRE: did you tried animate({'height': 0}) ?
[13:14:52] <TelFiRE> bartmax: that part works fine, it's the getting back to auto that's the problem
[13:15:38] <bartmax> TelFiRE: so save the initial then. initHeight = $(this).height() ; $(this).animate({'height':0}).animete({'height':initHeight});
[13:15:52] <bartmax> TelFiRE: lots of typos in there :D

[13:18:52] <Iarfen> Hi!!!
[13:19:24] <Iarfen> if I do $('#select').val('something') to a select and it changes his value it always has to fire onchange? I'm doing that with a hidden select (it has display: none) but it doesn't fire the onchange event... why it can be?
[13:19:39] <Iarfen> I think I explain good myself?
[13:20:21] <bung> Iarfen: try .change()
[13:23:18] <Iarfen> bung: it still doesn't work.....
[13:25:09] <bung> ?demo @ Iarfen
[13:25:10] <bot-t> Iarfen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:25:11] <Iarfen> bung: I give you a url with the code??
[13:25:24] <Iarfen> bung: ok xD
[13:27:07] <LindsayMac> Hey guys..
[13:28:05] <LindsayMac> I have a container element that is set to visibility:hidden when you scroll away from it. Inside of that container is another container that has visibility:visible.. but I thought that the parent element being hidden would override and control all of it's containers.
[13:28:31] <Iarfen> bung: see: http://www.games4ever.org/development
[13:28:36] <LindsayMac> Unfortunately this is not happening and i'm not entirely sure why.. The first thing I wanted to know if my assumptions are correct that the parent controls visibility
[13:28:48] <synk> hey guys, need help - trying to create a variable "test" from the div playbackButton of the attribute data-reference (this is a variable called form php. JQuery isn't getting the variable (undefined)
[13:28:48] <Iarfen> the problem is when you click on the customized select
[13:28:54] <synk>  var test = $(this).find('#playbackButton').attr('data-reference');
[13:29:02] <LindsayMac> ohh.. and nothing is set to "important"
[13:29:10] <synk> <div id="playbackButton">
[13:29:10] <synk> <a href="javascript:;" class="jp-play" data-reference=<?php echo "\"{$user['User']['data']}\""; ?> .. help
[13:29:36] <synk> test should be the data-reference call.
[13:29:53] <bung> LindsayMac: google seems to say that it doesnt work like that
[13:30:13] <bung> LindsayMac: stackoverflow says to set the children to :hidden, or display:none the parent
[13:30:31] <LindsayMac> huh?
[13:30:58] <LindsayMac> that dosnt make sense.. theyre not exactly the same thing.. plus I can't use display:none on these because i need them "there" because I have other scripts adding stuff to them
[13:31:04] <LindsayMac> display:none takes them out of the DOM
[13:31:06] <bung> LindsayMac: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=css+visibility+parent+child
[13:31:18] <bung> set :hidden on the children then
[13:31:18] <LindsayMac> bung:  I googled..
[13:31:33] <bung> the first result was a SO link with your pboelm
[13:31:36] <bung> problem even
[13:32:05] <LindsayMac> yea.. except its not
[13:32:06] <LindsayMac> if you set an element to be hidden, all its children will be, unless you explicitly make them visible (which is the case by specifying visibility: visible).
[13:32:23] <LindsayMac> because its not what is happening
[13:32:23] <bung> but thats not happening you say?
[13:32:33] <synk> hey guys, need help - trying to create a variable "test" from the div playbackButton of the attribute data-reference (this is a variable called form php. JQuery isn't getting the variable (undefined)
[13:32:41] <synk> see above
[13:32:48] <LindsayMac> I'm sorry never mind. im being retarded
[13:32:56] <bung> np
[13:32:58] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @ synk
[13:32:58] <bot-t> synk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:33:01] <LindsayMac> it is, but I can't seem to work around it
[13:33:07] <synk> thanks.
[13:33:26] <Iarfen> bung: do you know what to do with the select?
[13:33:43] <LindsayMac> ahhh this sucks
[13:33:44] <bung> Iarfen: what select?
[13:34:20] <bung> make a sample on jsfiddle.net, im not going to look through that page
[13:34:22] <Iarfen> the hidden select doesn't fire the onchange event
[13:34:24] <Iarfen> see: http://www.games4ever.org/development
[13:34:34] <Iarfen> bung: why not?
[13:34:39] <bung> maybe someone else will
[13:34:52] <Iarfen> bung: ok but why?
[13:34:53] <synk> heres the fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/uaAzN/
[13:35:06] <bung> Iarfen: because jsfiddle is better for collaborative coding
[13:35:17] <synk> basically , want to set "test" as a variable via query based on the data-reference (get from db)
[13:35:19] <bung> there is updating, everything is visible in one screen, etc
[13:36:00] <ryanneufeld> synk: you need to wrap your php tags in quotes, incase your value has white space
[13:36:15] <ryanneufeld> synk: what does your html look like when you view source on the page?
[13:37:39] <ryanneufeld> synk: also you're looking at the wrong element! You're looking at the <a> which is not what you're selecting with #playbackButton
[13:37:42] <Iarfen> bung: http://jsfiddle.net/fm3XV/
[13:38:14] <ryanneufeld> synk: http://jsfiddle.net/uaAzN/1/
[13:39:21] <ryanneufeld> synk: I'm not answering you in a PM :)
[13:39:30] <ryanneufeld> synk: Please see my comments here
[13:44:11] <synk> hi ryan, query still doesn't know what the variable 'test' is, undefined reference
[13:44:18] <bung> Iarfen: try .trigger('change')
[13:44:25] <bung> and .bind('change', function
[13:44:51] <bung> Iarfen: http://jsfiddle.net/dBxHv/
[13:45:10] <bung> no one wants to scroll through your code, thats why you make something simple and clean on jsfiddle
[13:45:18] <bung> and people can work on it with you
[13:45:45] <LindsayMac> oh phew ok.. fixed my issue. the tabs were loading with visibility:inherit but my javascript was making them visibility: visible when clicking on the tab to display where it shoul d have just switched them back to inherit
[13:45:58] <synk> source shows the data-reference is correct however..
[13:48:21] <LindsayMac> bung:  sorry for getting stupid on you.
[13:48:35] <bung> *shrug*
[13:48:39] <bung> Iarfen: http://jsfiddle.net/dBxHv/1/
[13:49:43] <Iarfen> bung: I try with bind() but it doesn't work
[13:49:55] <bung> so look at my updated sample
[13:50:01] <bung> and tell me if its what you need
[13:50:11] <bung> and if not, make modifications and press Update when youre done
[13:52:10] <Iarfen> bung: I don't know what to change, I try it on my code and it doesn't work, so I have to press update without doing anything?
[13:52:32] <bung> what?
[13:52:44] <synk> can someone look at this fiddle - the issue is the var test isn't being set, so the "mp3" has no file. http://jsfiddle.net/uaAzN/1/ thnx
[13:52:51] <bung> Iarfen: im just talking about updating on the jsfiddle.net link i gave you
[13:53:06] <bung> you can change the code and press update and it makes a new revision
[13:53:09] <bung> on that website
[13:53:38] <Iarfen> bung: I update
[13:54:18] <bung> link
[13:55:00] <bung> Iarfen: did you look at how my code works, is the logic what you need, or are you blindly trying to put stuff in your code?
[13:55:44] <Iarfen> bung: I need the logic
[13:55:54] <Iarfen> bung: But I don't understand why on my code it doesn't work
[14:00:12] <Iarfen> bung: now it works! :D
[14:00:33] <bung> Iarfen: cool nice work
[14:16:52] <GoGoGarrett> is there anyway to register a click handler back on once you do $('#blah').off('click')
[14:17:18] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/ddde730c84a439eb3bd6
[14:17:26] <GoGoGarrett> line 18 and 48

[14:19:02] <supsup> why do you want to remove it then add it back?
[14:19:41] <supsup> oh if the width is too large?
[14:20:29] <supsup> in your else just add it back?
[14:21:00] <supsup> ah guess then u could end up adding a ton of click events
[14:21:09] <supsup> remove it first then add it back
[14:21:11] <supsup> in the else
[14:28:35] <groundup> I am trying to create a "kiosk" using jQuery. I have it setup to go full screen on all browsers and I have it working that it can scroll through the frames.

[14:35:49] <DanTRUE> can somebody help me i have problem with     $("td#userN").live('mouseover', function(e){ here is ajax call }) problem is when I hover mouse over that element(td#userN) it start calling ajax too many times....
[14:37:59] <shoky> DanTRUE: tried 'mouseenter' ?
[14:39:19] <DanTRUE> it's the same
[14:40:06] <shoky> ?demo
[14:40:06] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:41:07] <lrvick> If i select an element currently in the dom and prepend it somewhere else, does that "move" the element, or duplicate it?
[14:41:19] <shoky> lrvick: it moves it
[14:42:50] <DanTRUE> ok just a sec
[14:44:24] <Nami-Doc> Hi
[14:45:26] <Nami-Doc> I'd like to know why $('a:eq(0)').attr('href') is not giving me the same result as document.getElementsByTagName('a')[0].href ?
[14:45:50] <Nami-Doc> for the first, there's only the relative part, for the second I get the full url
[14:45:59] <danzik171> Nami-Doc: attr !== property
[14:46:10] <danzik171> if you change the first to .prop( "href" ), it'll be the full url
[14:46:26] <danzik171> if you change the second to .getAttribute( "href" ), the second will be relative
[14:47:27] <Nami-Doc> danzik171: thanks.
[14:47:33] <Nami-Doc> now this makes sense :D
[14:47:52] <bung> danzik171: cool to know ^5
[14:50:50] <DanTRUE> can i give you demo that is now working a mean this part of jq code .. sorry I'm not very good at making this demo
[15:05:03] <M4d3L1> hi. how I can get the object by index when using something like ('input[name="phone[]"]');
[15:05:57] <M4d3L1> I would like to get the object phone[2]
[15:06:42] <codacoder> M4d3L1paste [2] on the end but that's dom not jQ
[15:07:08] <codacoder> if u want jQ, wrap it again in $()
[15:08:14] <M4d3L1> â¦ $('input[name="phone[]"]'); is jQ ...
[15:08:41] <codacoder> $('input[name="phone[]"]')[2] or $($('input[name="phone[]"]')[2])
[15:09:02] <codacoder> first is a dom element - 2nd is jQ again
[15:09:30] <codacoder> it depends what u want to end up with
[15:09:45] <M4d3L1> thank. looking for the second one
[15:09:48] <ajpiano> codacoder: you don't wrap it again with jq
[15:09:50] <ajpiano> M4d3L1
[15:09:53] <ajpiano> you use .eq(2)
[15:10:00] <ajpiano> when you want to index into a jquery collection by number
[15:10:11] <ajpiano> and get a jquery object back out
[15:10:34] <M4d3L1> ok
[15:10:35] <codacoder> both work tho
[15:11:01] <ajpiano> yes but one is "right"
[15:11:08] <M4d3L1> nice. it work like a charm :)
[15:11:28] <codacoder> lol - sorry, my mind reading powers are a little limited ;)

[15:33:22] <MistuhKurtz> howdy LoneStar99
[15:33:31] <LoneStar99> .change() is used when an option is changed in select bx?
[15:56:08] <LoneStar99> anyone have experience with select boxes?
[16:06:17] <LoneStar99> have the following and only want the value of the clicked slect box to appear - currently two values always appear no matter what --> http://jsfiddle.net/DhKvY/
[16:09:28] <M4d3L1> var countCol = $(table).find("tr:first td").length; do I make a mistake in that? to count table column? it return alway 0.

[16:29:24] <Giverny> ajpiano
[16:30:02] <ajpiano> no matter how many ways you try to wrap it, ajax is asynchronous
[16:30:06] <ajpiano> especially jsonp
[16:30:12] <ajpiano> you can't return the restult back into the calling function
[16:30:14] <ajpiano> ?ajax101

[17:01:58] <tds5016> hi.
[17:02:33] <tds5016> can someone tell me how I would disable the save/copy dialogue, but not scrolling on an ipad?
[17:03:06] <tds5016> event.preventDefault() works to stop both of them, but I just want to stop the thing from save/copy, I don't want to disable dragging.
[17:03:21] <tds5016> and yes, I realize it doesn't stop people from saving the image; that's not my intent here.
[17:03:36] <tds5016> the issue is that I need to make them hold an image before drag and drop starts.

[18:10:11] <ejcweb> I've got two click event handlers attached to an element. They fire in the order in which they were added. How can I make the first one stop the second one from being called?
[18:10:57] <ejcweb> e.preventDefault() doesn't seem to be doing the trick in this case (as I'd normally use to prevent other handlers from firing).
[18:14:45] <ejcweb> Can anyone help? Short example: http://jsfiddle.net/EWaDn/1/
[18:15:24] <matteu> I'm currently debugging a slider form element.  Whenever I use the slider (start sliding), the slider hides -- as in the slider's height reduces to zero.  I am assuming a jQuery event is doing this, but I don't know where the code is or what element it's attached to (multiple class names on the element in question, and on parents, etc.).  How could one go about isolating when and where that hide or animate event is firing from?  Is there a w
[18:19:32] <matteu> ejcweb: you'll maybe want to manipulate the fx queue.  jQuery(this).stop().clearQueue(); as the first line of the first click event
[18:19:45] <matteu> ejcweb: assuming you're using the main fx queue as in the example
[18:20:56] <matteu> ejcweb: as I understand it, and you'll want to double check me, preventDefault() is only used to prevent default browser behaviors and not events that you supply after the fact
[18:26:57] <brl0> ejcweb: you might try stopPropagation()
[18:27:06] <brl0> if someone hasn't said that already
[18:27:07] <brl0> ;D
[18:33:09] <matteu> brl0: stopPropagation mean the click event won't propagate up through the dom
[18:33:48] <matteu> brl0: ejcweb: all click handlers should execute for the element in question, stopPropagation won't affect that, as far as I understand it
[18:34:52] <matteu> ejcweb: I should have thought of this earlier, look into bind: http://api.jquery.com/bind/ that would be a more elegant solution than stop, clearQueue
[18:35:30] <ejcweb> matteu, brl0: stopImmediatePropagation was what I was looking for.

[18:53:05] <djshotglass> doesnt stop it from submitting the form
[18:53:37] <azbyin> djshotglass, thats because somewhere else in the code .click is bound to something for that button
[18:54:30] <w00tner> how can i convert from MySQL to JSON and SQLite ??
[18:55:24] <djshotglass> not in my code azariah, and the only js libs loaded are jquery and bootstrap
[18:56:11] <djshotglass> adding $("#gobtn").click(function() {}); doesnt stop it from submmitng
[18:56:42] <azbyin> djshotglass, when you are setting another click callback, it is *appending* to the existing click callbacks
[18:56:50] <azbyin> and not replacing the existing callback
[18:57:06] <djshotglass> hmm is there a way i can see what is there already
[18:57:12] <azbyin> visualevent
[18:57:18] <azbyin> try that, it might show you
[18:57:24] <azbyin> sometimes it doesn;t work
[19:02:16] <djshotglass> the 2 events visualevent shows seem unrelated
[19:02:29] <djshotglass> tiggering them does not submit the form
[19:03:36] <w00tner> Scenario: I have this coupon webapp, im using a JSON file the data, the webapp is working great but when i go to Eclipse and try to emulate the app it doesnt read the file, so my guess is to download this file and covert it to SQLite for better native support. Is this right or am i doing it all wrong? HELP!

[19:25:52] <tgg> tw2113: yes, how do I do it then?
[19:26:26] <tw2113> you could try targeting with a class

[19:41:37] <tw2113> according to http://api.jquery.com/height/
[19:41:46] <tw2113> it wouldn't include margin/border/padding

[19:54:06] <jimubao> Hi guys, i being looking into  a jquery event, .load()
[19:54:56] <jimubao> however from jquery api doc, it state that "It doesn't work consistently nor reliably cross-browser"
[19:55:06] <coldhead> oh #jquery, i forgot about you

[19:55:37] <jimubao> are there any better suggestion to detect when all images is loaded then do some function

[20:02:26] <oojacoboo> I was thinking I could use $.inArray() but the array isn't that clean and of course contains objects
[20:03:00] <djshotglass> $("#chatul li:lt(" + ($("#chatul").length-20) + ")").remove();
[20:03:18] <djshotglass> trying to remove all but the last 20 lis in a ul
[20:04:16] <oojacoboo> djshotglass, I think there is a nice selector for this
[20:04:37] <oojacoboo> $("#chatul li(<20)").remove();
[20:04:41] <oojacoboo> something along those lines
[20:05:23] <oojacoboo> djshotglass, http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[20:05:57] <oojacoboo> oh, I see what you're doing now :P
[20:08:35] <djshotglass> Error: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #chatul li(<20)
[20:13:06] <oojacoboo> djshotglass, you get it?
[20:13:07] <oojacoboo> you missed the li in your .length
[20:13:07] <oojacoboo> you want to get the number of li elements in the object for counting
[20:13:57] <djshotglass> right

[20:19:54] <oojacoboo> azbyin, that does work, you're doing something else wrong

[20:21:25] <azbyin> i know there is nothing wrong with the link itself because i can click it manually and it works fine
[20:21:30] <oojacoboo> tw2113, what am I missing here?  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[20:22:00] <oojacoboo> azbyin, it's not going to actually "click" that link AFAIK
[20:22:12] <azbyin> yeah, i want it to click the link!
[20:22:32] <oojacoboo> window.location = $("#file_download).attr("href"); or something like that
[20:22:34] <azbyin> i guess i simply need to extract the href and set window.location to it
[20:22:38] <azbyin> hah..
[20:23:26] <tw2113> setting jquery on the left, oojacoboo ?

[20:55:39] <martisj> how valuable is it to jslint or jshint our code?
[20:57:10] <danzik171> extremely.
[20:57:17] <astropirate> worth 10 bricks of gold pressed latnum
[20:57:23] <oojacoboo> lol
[20:59:39] <martisj> honest?
[21:00:10] <martisj> \/s/honest/honestly/
[21:00:34] <coldhead> try it and if it saves you some bugs you'll appreciate it
[21:00:48] <coldhead> and if it doesn't, you can have your money back
[21:01:12] <astropirate> I think its good for when working with multiple teams.. or you are somewhat new with javascript
[21:01:27] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: can I have my money back?
[21:01:40] <coldhead> let me get out my checkbook
[21:02:06] <coldhead> it's also very good when you have trailing commas that you don't notice because you don't test in IE
[21:02:14] <martisj> aha :)
[21:02:29] <martisj> well it's going to be difficult to convince senior dev to use it.
[21:02:39] <astropirate> I love js hint
[21:02:44] <astropirate> jslint.. not somuch
[21:02:58] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I had the trailing comma problem today
[21:03:07] <ryanneufeld> minification found it!
[21:03:20] <coldhead> martisj: what possible reason could your dev have not to use it?
[21:03:34] <coldhead> you can still lint your own code outside of the communal workflow anyway
[21:03:39] <martisj> different ides :)
[21:03:47] <martisj> yeah i know
[21:03:47] <scar> has anyone ever used nivo to scroll 3 images in a carousel type?
[21:04:06] <coldhead> martisj: you can put it as a pre-commit hook in your version control workflow
[21:04:15] <coldhead> and avoid the IDE issues
[21:04:15] <martisj> but i see all the lints in sublime in real time so when i pull up a js file it's full of heinous looking lines.
[21:04:17] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: unless you use svn
[21:04:26] <coldhead> svn has pre-commit hooks
[21:04:30] <martisj> we're using svn :)
[21:04:36] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: not client side :p
[21:04:42] <coldhead> oh right
[21:04:53] <coldhead> Committed revision 170435.
[21:04:59] <coldhead> >: D
[21:05:22] <coldhead> martisj: yes, you want to be able to apply it selectively
[21:05:27] <coldhead> and not have it bitch about old code
[21:05:45] <martisj> coldhead: should probably turn it off.
[21:05:47] <martisj> for a sev
[21:06:25] <coldhead> its hard to apply it to an existing project
[21:06:40] <coldhead> i just lint new stuff that i am writing on the command line before i commit it
[21:06:56] <coldhead> and if i turn out better code than other people because of it THEN THAT'S JUST TOO FREAKING BAD
[21:07:07] <coldhead> although it never actually turns out that way
[21:07:13] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day using jQuery
[21:07:28] <martisj> coldhead: aha :)
[21:07:33] <martisj> interesting
[21:08:21] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: liar
[21:08:26] <ryanneufeld> it's at least your second day
[21:08:49] <coldhead> second day is pretty much first day
[21:09:02] <coldhead> it's pretty much pretty much my first day

[21:13:35] <coldhead> "Without the contributions of the following people we could not exist:"
[21:13:52] <coldhead> you are clearly well past your first day with jQuery
[21:14:03] <ryanneufeld> getting there

[21:26:10] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: I quit

[22:03:29] <djshotglass> $("#chatdl dd:lt(" + (dtx-20) + ")").remove();
[22:03:40] <djshotglass> can i combine those into one selector
[22:05:08] <coldhead> $("#chatdl").find('dd,dt').filter(":lt(" + (dtx-20) + ")").remove();
[22:05:25] <coldhead> or possibly duplicate the filter bit twice inside the find()
[22:23:44] <djshotglass> is there a way to $.getJSON every 2.5 seconds
[22:23:53] <djshotglass> or should i just use setTimeout

[22:30:17] <rgr> in a mouse over for a parent element, whats correct syntax to add a class to all immediate children of a certain class?  Do I need to use find/Findall or can one do someting like $(this > ul).addClass?
[22:31:14] <rgr> oh children. sorry.early.
[22:33:31] <gloomer> you can do $(this > ul).addClass
[22:38:20] <coldhead> djshotglass: setTimeout, that's what it's therefor
[22:39:22] <djshotglass> coldhead but it only fires the first time
[22:39:40] <djshotglass> the setTimeout from within the $.getJSON doesn't do anything
[22:42:16] <coldhead> djshotglass: http://jsfiddle.net/GHXu8/
[22:44:32] <djshotglass> coldhead what happens if a couple of the requests take over a second
[22:44:37] <djshotglass> they begin to pile up
[22:44:47] <coldhead> no they don't
[22:44:51] <djshotglass> i dont want to start the next timer until the json request is done
[22:45:04] <coldhead> it won't cue up the next request until the first is done
[22:45:19] <coldhead> read this http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[22:45:34] <coldhead> that talks about your exact cueing fear and how to fix it
[22:45:36] <coldhead> all shall be well
[22:45:46] <djshotglass> <3

[22:48:42] <rgr> gloomer: you can? Hmm. cant seem to get it to work. $(this).children(">ul").addClass adds to the children of the ul. so bect way to select all immediate children of a certain class of $(this)?
[22:49:28] <coldhead> $(this).find('> *')
[22:52:15] <rgr> no "children" shortcut? Ok thanks.
[22:53:01] <coldhead> $(this).children()
[22:53:04] <coldhead> that's a thing, too
[22:53:10] <coldhead> ?children
[22:53:10] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[22:54:12] <rgr> should be immediate kids right? Hmm. my erros mus be somewhere else since .children("ul") should give me all immediate children that are ULs.
[22:55:07] <coldhead> children('ul') should do as you sau
[22:55:09] <coldhead> say*
[22:55:13] <coldhead> they demo it in the docs
[22:55:50] <rgr> yeah, must do. Ive screwed up elsewhere dare say. sleep still in eyes ;)
[22:57:06] <rgr> but just while you're there, is there a short cut along the lines of $(this .findclass) instead of $(this).find(".findclass") ?
[22:58:15] <coldhead> $('.findclass', this)
[22:59:57] <rgr> ah
[23:00:54] <coldhead> so that's the same as $('.findClass') except you specify a node to begin searching from
[23:37:14] <rgr> that worked and is exacly what I wanted. thanks.
[23:46:07] <tw2113> coldhead, you failed me
[23:46:32] <coldhead> oh god i am sorry
[23:46:46] <tw2113> you didn't remind me to FTP up my changed files before i refresh the browser
[23:46:53] <tw2113> causing me to go "wtf" and swear a lot
[23:46:59] <coldhead> that's... not the kind of thing i remind anyone of
[23:47:03] <tw2113> all while talently scratching my head at the same time
[23:47:08] <coldhead> i barely know what FTP is
[23:47:19] <tw2113> i think it's like ssh but for the stupid
[23:47:32] <coldhead> i feel like the target audience
[23:47:54] <tw2113> *feels coldhead* no, you feel human
[23:47:55] <tw2113> not stupid
[23:48:08] <coldhead> i am too stupid for ssh though
[23:48:13] <coldhead> i guess there's a middle ground
[23:49:08] <bigLanky> i am trying to run this slider
[23:49:09] <bigLanky> http://www.csslab.cl/2011/08/18/jquery-timelinr/
[23:49:21] <bigLanky> i have it operational on one page, but i need it to be horizontal on another page
[23:49:46] <bigLanky> http://pastebin.com/N2x7MWQW
[23:50:12] <bigLanky> thats the initialization code for my first one... how can i adapt that to have different settings for a different page?
[23:52:40] <tw2113> wrap it in a WP conditional tag
[23:53:19] <tw2113> if(is_page('one')) { echo this } elseif(is_page('two')) { echo that }
[23:53:27] <bigLanky> its not for a wordpress site
[23:53:39] <tw2113> oops
[23:53:44] <tw2113> i was thinking that was yours for some reason
[23:53:45] <tw2113> my bad
[23:53:57] <tw2113> i've spent too much time in DNS settings lately
[23:54:17] <tw2113> you'll have to find some way to conditionally set some settings
[23:55:34] <tw2113> i dunno what programming language your site is based on
[23:55:35] <tw2113> php?
[23:55:39] <bigLanky> yes
[23:55:39] <tw2113> static html?
[23:55:51] <bigLanky> its a drupal site, but custom module, so php
[23:56:29] <tw2113> hmm
[23:56:38] <tw2113> i'm almost to my usefulness
[23:56:45] <tw2113> never done drupal before, so not sure how they do things
