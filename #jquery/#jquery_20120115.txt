[00:05:08] <muzone> good morning lovers
[00:41:38] <jita> I have a list of dynamically generated forms with fields input id="id_form-0-amount" and select id="id_form-0-unit". Now i want to change the values of the latter when the former's value is changed. How can i do onchange on dynamic mulptiple forms ?
[00:44:46] <shesek> jita, I'd personally use something like `<input id="id_form-0-amount" data-linkedunit="id_form-0-unit" />`
[00:45:20] <shesek> than $('[data-linkedunit]').change(function() {    var unit = $('#' + $(this).data('linkedunit'));  unit.val(...);   });
[00:54:13] <jita> shesek, i want it such that whenever any amount is changed, the corresponding unit values are displayed only in the select
[01:01:21] <rmccue> Hi there, is there a way to bind to all events on a given element?
[01:11:45] <nicholas> hello
[01:11:55] <nicholas> is anyone awake?
[01:12:03] <crab> what's up?
[01:12:17] <Guest49131> i am working on a website
[01:12:26] <Guest49131> and i am new to jquery but not too new
[01:12:35] <Guest49131> i want to reverse engineer my first site
[01:12:46] <Guest49131> and i could use some advice
[01:13:08] <Guest49131> it is a fairly advanced site
[01:13:33] <firebalrog> And the question is?
[01:13:49] <Guest49131> where is a resource that discusses code at length line by line but isnt introductory
[01:14:12] <Guest49131> is there a space that is above introduction that discusses jquery websites
[01:14:15] <Guest49131> and code
[01:14:30] <Guest49131> and gets into logical statements
[01:14:43] <Guest49131> and implementation
[01:14:59] <Guest49131> ./nick nicholas
[01:15:13] <Guest49131> i would be curious to know
[01:15:24] <redsquare> why dont you show us a url
[01:16:25] <Guest49131> http://tympanus.net/Development/RestaurantTemplate/
[01:16:31] <Guest49131> i want to learn everything i can about this site
[01:16:51] <Guest49131> and i am looking at the code and i know i am just barely illiterate enough to know how to change it
[01:16:59] <Guest49131> i can understand the map functions
[01:17:19] <manixor> Hello guys. I run into this :http://visualslideshow.com/, it's a slideshow maker. But when I'm trying to use it with jquery script it's crash. Anyone it's familiar with it?
[01:17:19] <Guest49131> i can read the code and understand the code but i want to grow into mastering this jquery language based on this site
[01:18:22] <Guest49131> i would like some advice as to how to begin breaking it apart and understanding the components of the site
[01:18:40] <Guest49131> i am matching up classes with js references
[01:18:53] <Guest49131> and reading the html and understanding how its put together
[01:19:13] <redsquare> Guest49131 there is hardly any hand rolled script there
[01:19:43] <Guest49131> how do you know that?
[01:19:59] <redsquare> i looked
[01:20:09] <Guest49131> and even if it is hand rolled i need to know how to interpret it
[01:20:26] <Guest49131> are you saying she just copied and pasted code from elsewhere online and that i can reference it
[01:20:36] <Guest49131> and read how to do it myself
[01:20:41] <nVee> Morning, I have a button which will trigger a print() plugin, but I need the containing class in which that button is. I know the containing class name but there are multiples, how do I iterate to get to that class?
[01:20:49] <Guest49131> because if so where do that?
[01:20:56] <Guest49131> and how do you look up unreferenced code?
[01:20:57] <redsquare> Guest49131 oh so you are not the author
[01:21:03] <Guest49131> no
[01:21:12] <redsquare> oh, you didnt mention that earlier
[01:21:16] <Guest49131> i am trying to understand the site
[01:21:36] <Guest49131> and i think i know how about 70 of it works from the html to the css
[01:21:52] <Guest49131> but the jquery is what i want to master and i could use a reference that hits at that level
[01:21:58] <Guest49131> which is above introduction
[01:22:15] <Guest49131> lynda.com doesnt really provide what i need
[01:22:17] <redsquare> have you written any jquery
[01:22:31] <Guest49131> i have read jquery manuals and done a four hour lesson on lynda.com
[01:22:47] <Guest49131> and i worked in the processing programming language for about three months
[01:22:51] <Guest49131> learning basic programming skills
[01:23:08] <Guest49131> i am trying to learn
[01:23:16] <Guest49131> and could use some help
[01:23:19] <Guest49131> i dont come into IRC often
[01:23:22] <redsquare> k, not much then - just practice man, try answer questions here and SO
[01:23:45] <redsquare> build your own pages, soon pick it up
[01:23:56] <Guest49131> alright man
[01:23:59] <Guest49131> thanks
[01:24:09] <nVee> hey redsquare: can you help perhaps? I need to add a function of a parent class
[01:24:09] <redsquare> there is not one magic resource that implants the knowledge
[01:24:36] <nVee> so my onclick needs to print the container in which the button is
[01:24:50] <nVee> I know the container name, but it is a class and the page has multiple of these classes
[01:25:41] <redsquare> ? .closest @ nVee
[01:25:42] <bot-t> nVee, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:32:37] <nVee> redsquare: Just out of curiousity and knowledge, could or would parent("selectorName") not also work?
[01:34:03] <tman> $(this).find("td:first").html().split(',')[0].wrap('<div></div>') <- why does that fail?  when i console log up to the wrap i see the expected string
[01:34:10] <tman> is it because it's expecting a jquery object?
[01:35:01] <redsquare> yes tman
[01:35:09] <tman> how do i convert it into a jquery object
[01:35:15] <tman> i'm having a hard time getting my head around it.
[01:35:18] <redsquare> your [0] turns it to a dom node that doesnt have a .wrap method
[01:35:33] <redsquare> wait
[01:35:36] <tman> ok
[01:35:47] <redsquare> splitting the html by comma?
[01:35:57] <tman> yea here's the table:
[01:36:01] <tman> http://braininjury.com/index3.shtml
[01:36:13] <tman> the first column has commas
[01:36:32] <tman> and i thought it would be a good excersize for me to manipulate the type
[01:36:37] <tman> ie, bold the stuff before the ,
[01:36:49] <tman> i nearly have it.. ie, i see the console returning me what i want
[01:36:54] <tman> it's just not in the right format.
[01:37:23] <redsquare> but they are not elements just text
[01:37:29] <tman> yea
[01:37:41] <tman> this would also prevent me from having to manually edit the dom
[01:37:45] <tman> which i don't want to do.
[01:38:02] <redsquare> 1 sec
[01:38:37] <tman> ok
[01:44:15] <nVee> If I use paging built with jquery, will the results still get listed on search engines?
[01:45:14] <hawkeye78__> hello
[01:50:05] <hawkeye78__> i am a compley beginner in the usage of jquery and this is my first try http://pastebin.com/XQtjSMJ6 but it doesn't work can someone here tell me, why?
[01:51:54] <josh9> what's the difference between $(document).ready(function(){ ... });   and (function($) { .... })(jQuery); ?
[01:52:01] <redsquare> hawkeye78__ move the script to just before the closing body tag
[01:52:13] <redsquare> hawkeye78__ or use a doc ready block
[01:52:18] <nVee> try http://pastebin.com/EdMjX1Yk
[01:52:28] <redsquare> ? .ready @ hawkeye78__
[01:52:29] <nVee> hawkeye78__: http://pastebin.com/EdMjX1Yk
[01:52:29] <bot-t> hawkeye78__, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:53:02] <Li22aRd> hi, i duplicate one form in my page with the following command: $('#search_form-').clone().attr('id', '#search_form-' + tab).appendTo('#menuSearchContainer'); problem is i cant select the duplicated fields in the new form, anyone can help how to do that?
[01:53:37] <hawkeye78__> thanks to you :)
[01:53:39] <_ramo> hi
[01:53:45] <hawkeye78__> i try your version nVee
[01:53:48] <hawkeye78__> just one moment
[01:54:24] <redsquare> Li22aRd you will end up with duplicate id's in the dom which will give jquery issues since id's have to be unique
[01:54:36] <redsquare> Li22aRd you need to clean the id's before appending
[01:54:37] <hawkeye78__> it works thanks :)
[01:55:01] <Li22aRd> redsquare: there are no id's for the original form elements
[01:55:28] <Li22aRd> i would select to elements of the form to give them unique ids
[01:55:46] <_ramo> does anyone noticed issues with jquery ui Autocomplete and IE7/8 ? for me it's not working. my code looks like this: http://privatepaste.com/f1f55b40fd/fdj657i7iasdfsaf
[01:55:47] <redsquare> Li22aRd so your sure $('#search_form-').length === 1?
[01:57:20] <nVee> If I use paging built with jquery, will the results still get listed on search engines?
[01:57:32] <Li22aRd> redsquare: yes
[01:58:22] <redsquare> Li22aRd so after the clone append you cannot see the copy in the dom using chrom inspector/firebug
[01:58:56] <Li22aRd> i see it in firefox/firebug
[02:00:06] <redsquare> so it is there
[02:01:18] <Li22aRd> $('#search_form-').clone().attr('id', '#search_form-' + tab).appendTo('#menuSearchContainer');
[02:01:26] <Li22aRd> $('#search_form-0').length
[02:01:32] <Li22aRd> is 0
[02:02:14] <redsquare> so in firebug you can see the new cloned element
[02:02:18] <redsquare> what is the id
[02:02:25] <redsquare> ah wait
[02:02:33] <redsquare> .attr('id', 'search_form-' + tab)
[02:02:38] <redsquare> you had a # in it
[02:05:31] <Li22aRd> looser error, you are the man, thx :)
[02:08:00] <redsquare> np
[02:10:21] <k_89> there were some changes in how $.live works, right?? can't find them in the docs
[02:11:45] <Zogot> It was my understanding that live is being replaced by .on
[02:11:56] <shesek> k_89, its being removed
[02:13:04] <shesek> k_89, and it is documented quite well on the docs
[02:40:42] <jita> any idea why doesnt this work? http://www.webdevout.net/test?01e
[02:46:37] <wrksx> hey
[02:47:05] <wrksx> I'm trying to have fun with $.fn.myfunc = function(){}
[02:47:30] <wrksx> but the function is then available on every jquery object
[02:47:56] <wrksx> what's the correct way to bind a function to a limited amount of object ?
[02:48:38] <wrksx> for instance, I can select these with a classic selector, what would be the syntax ?
[02:52:33] <cojack> hello
[02:52:54] <cojack> any one using the http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/ ?
[02:53:03] <cojack> I have problem with clone the object with this widget
[02:53:28] <cojack> after cloning the event is cloned too, but is fired to the *parent* widget not to the cloned
[02:54:26] <cojack> how to override the clone event in plugins api?
[02:54:35] <cojack> can any one hint me ? ;]
[02:57:02] <redsquare> pass in false to the clone so it doesnt copy the events
[02:59:03] <cojack> but I wish to have copied events
[03:06:02] <phidah> This line of code: container = $('<div class="overlay_container overlay_' + settings.position + '">'); results in  Object doesn't support this property or method - in IE only. Can anyone tell me why?
[03:06:47] <cojack> ohhh
[03:06:58] <cojack> cloning in jquery ui is bugged
[03:07:02] <cojack> not good
[03:08:43] <ravenzz> phidah $('<div/>').addClass('overlay_container overlay_'+settings.position);
[03:09:38] <ravenzz> var foo = $('<div/>').addClass('overlay_container overlay_'+settings.position); of course
[03:12:51] <phidah> ravenzz: I'll try that, thanks. How come IE doesn't like the other one?
[03:14:12] <ravenzz> dunno
[03:14:24] <ravenzz> maybe it is not because of that
[03:14:53] <ravenzz> or there is a missing var statement
[03:15:13] <phidah> I simply added var in front of the other line - that worked
[03:15:18] <ravenzz> yep
[03:15:47] <ravenzz> you should read this

[03:18:04] <hravula> hi everyone
[03:24:18] <doxin> i can't get jquery.get() to work, it neither does the request nor gives an error. wth am i doing wrong?
[03:25:44] <doxin> my code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/535063/
[03:39:11] <ravenz> ?demo @ doxin
[03:39:12] <bot-t> doxin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[03:48:01] <doxin> ravenz: hmm, hold on.
[03:48:04] <redsquare> doxin it will make the request, you just dont do anything with the response
[03:48:10] <redsquare> doxin http://jsfiddle.net/kQsVj/
[03:48:18] <doxin> redsquare: i don't need the response
[03:48:31] <doxin> redsquare: the request does stuff on the server.
[03:48:35] <redsquare> well it does make the request - check the network tab in chrome debugger
[03:48:40] <doxin> hmm
[03:49:27] <redsquare> but...putting your js in attributes is not good. Try to hook things up in a script block rather than inlining
[03:49:36] <redsquare> makes it hard to debug!
[03:50:04] <doxin> redsquare: i do see the problem now tough, the request is all fine and dandy, but it doesn't like the redirect :I
[03:50:33] <redsquare> well the .get will follow any redirect
[03:50:42] <redsquare> but your doing nothing with it so it doesnt matter
[03:51:12] <doxin> redsquare: stop saying that. i AM doing something with it serverside, so it does matter.
[03:51:27] <redsquare> not in terms of the client js
[03:51:32] <redsquare> and this is a jquery channel
[03:51:36] <doxin> redsquare: OH! fudgers. the redirect is to a different server. that's going to trip it up. isn't it?
[03:52:01] <redsquare> so its a 302
[03:52:17] <doxin> yes.
[03:52:18] <redsquare> yes, cant do ajax x-domain, why not do it server side then
[03:52:25] <doxin> redsquare: doing that now.
[04:31:25] <_ramo> does someone know how to invite facebook friends from a website, to join the website ?
[05:15:52] <wrksx> with jquery animate method you can define the duration of the animation. Somehow jquery calculates speed to achieve the animation. So why wouldn't one be able to define speed instead of duration for any animation ?
[05:16:18] <wrksx> sthing like pixels / seconds
[05:17:45] <jita> How can i do this http://dpaste.org/HwRSH/ ?
[05:18:08] <StPiere> how to check if some plugin is loaded ?
[05:18:18] <jita> for (j, k in i) gives error
[05:18:36] <jita> isn't it a valid statement ?
[05:19:18] <Guddu> Dear All....I have a modal form which i am using to add a record. When i submit the form and if everything is ok, I would like to form to close. BUt this is not happening. My code snippet for the form is as follows....http://pastebin.com/QsR269rU could you please guide me
[05:19:48] <Guddu> When i submit and if the add is successful, the modal form popup remains open and the html contents become empty.
[05:26:03] <reddobowen> Hey. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how I could change the highlighted button in a nav bar, depending upon what section you're currently scrolled over? I'm using the jQuery scrollTo package (http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html) for the scrolling..
[05:42:46] <Guddu> Dear All....I have a modal form which i am using to add a record. When i submit the form and if everything is ok, I would like to form to close. BUt this is not happening. My code snippet for the form is as follows....http://pastebin.com/QsR269rU could you please guide me
[05:42:47] <Guddu> When i submit and if the add is successful, the modal form popup remains open and the html contents become empty.
[05:45:37] <mansoor> Guddu: on what line is your  statement to close the modal
[05:46:43] <Guddu> mansoor, Thanks for your response. The code that i pasted was for displaying the form....the form itself gets launched by this piece of code that i pasted below
[05:46:44] <Guddu>                     <a href="/EMS/items/add_item" class="thickbox none new" title="New Item">New {{entity_name_singular}}</a>
[05:47:43] <redsquare> ? thickbox @ Guddu
[05:47:43] <bot-t> Guddu, Thickbox was abandoned by Cody like an unwanted child but jQuery UI Dialog is awesome. p.s. Cody loves his kids.
[05:48:55] <mansoor> Guddu: you  said you were trying to close the modal but it wasn't closing, it was just being emptied, Can I see that part of the code?
[05:49:05] <mansoor> unless i've read it wrong
[05:49:05] <Guddu> redsquare, JQuery UI Dialog can host forms inside? And is it possible for the form to remain open if there are errror on forms....and close when the form action iss success? Could you please send me some examples?
[05:49:22] <Guddu> mansoor, U read it right.....
[05:49:38] <ravenzz> Guddu try with $.ajax instead of load
[05:49:40] <Guddu> The code that i pasted is to launch the form....here is the code again
[05:49:48] <Guddu> <a href="/EMS/items/add_item" class="thickbox none new" title="New Item">New {{entity_name_singular}}</a>
[05:50:06] <ravenzz> you'll have more control over the callbacks/return statuses
[05:50:21] <redsquare> Guddu yes
[05:50:31] <Guddu> mansoor, My thickbox is here http://pastebin.com/jF53ZsaG
[05:50:43] <redsquare> ? demo @ Guddu
[05:50:44] <derik> how i do in jquery a live change like on http://www.stat-football.com/en/t/eng10.php?c=22 1StHalf and 2ndhalf ?
[05:50:44] <bot-t> Guddu, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[05:50:59] <ravenzz> I have to go bye
[05:53:29] <redsquare> derik u can just show hide a div, or use an ajax call to bring in the data
[05:54:03] <derik> redsquare i am beginer on jquery, you can explain more
[05:54:42] <redsquare> derik well do you know any javascript or jquery
[05:54:55] <derik> no
[05:55:06] <redsquare> I suggest you read some tutorials first and playing around
[05:55:37] <redsquare> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/tag/easy/
[05:56:05] <Guddu> redsquare, Do you have any handy example for JQUERY UI Dialog with forms?
[05:57:08] <redsquare> guddu - have you searched! http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[06:01:02] <Guddu> redsquare, thanks i have seen the demo now....can i also use ajax in this modal form?
[06:01:19] <redsquare> yup, its just a div
[06:09:11] <Guddu> redsquare, How about http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#ajaxForm
[06:09:27] <Guddu> redsquare, Would you recommend using that one instead in my case?
[06:13:37] <redsquare> that is not a dialog
[06:13:57] <redsquare> that just ajax enables your forms, which you dont need a plugin for really. Its very easy
[06:27:04] <derik> how i do when page load to start empty not load all div  http://pastehtml.com/view/bktinbp14.html
[06:50:43] <redsquare> derik use css to hide elements you dont want to show
[06:54:54] <Guddu> Hi All...what is wrong with this snippet? Am i not using the this variable corerectly?
[06:54:55] <Guddu> $(document).ready(function(){
[06:54:55] <Guddu>   $("a").mouseover(function(){
[06:54:55] <Guddu>     $("this").css("color","red");
[06:54:55] <Guddu>   });
[06:54:55] <Guddu> });
[06:55:34] <udp> Guddu: this, not "this"
[06:55:35] <kborchers> Guddu: Please don't paste code in the channel see ?p
[06:55:35] <bot-t> Guddu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:56:21] <Guddu> Thanks udp.... kborchers sorry about that i will be attentive to this now.
[06:56:52] <kborchers> No problem, just a friendly reminder. :)
[06:58:29] <Guddu> :)

[07:29:59] <black_warlock> reddbowen: just set on click operations to change class
[07:30:41] <hij1nx> anyone?
[07:30:50] <hij1nx> speculations welcome
[07:32:23] <hij1nx> i guess i could just branch for 'mozilla' and do `$(document).scrollTop(0);`
[07:32:38] <hij1nx> but the animation is so nice
[07:32:38] <black_warlock> rite
[07:33:08] <black_warlock> put an if
[07:33:18] <timwis> Hey guys, why does it take forever to render a page with a large nested <ul> list on jQuery Mobile? (only on mobile devices)
[07:33:26] <hij1nx> I'm guessing 835 of the 837 people in here are auto logged in to this irc/chan
[07:33:27] <timwis> Any way to speed it up?
[07:34:22] <hij1nx> timwis: turn your mobile debug on and put a console logs in to figure out if you have something that is unexpectedly recursing
[07:34:39] <timwis> okay, thanks hij1nx I'll try that
[07:34:49] <hij1nx> a large ul by it self shouldn't take a long time, sounds like a side effect
[07:35:15] <redsquare> Guddu no, you have to do it yourself
[07:35:32] <black_warlock> hij1nx you can use jquery.browser identification to specify what function must execute
[07:35:53] <hij1nx> black_warlock: I know that
[07:35:56] <black_warlock> respect to the browser in use
[07:36:00] <Guddu> redsquare, In my case the form contents get dynamically generated (Django Framework)....is there anything else that suits my requirements?
[07:36:02] <hij1nx> black_warlock: but that's easy
[07:36:10] <hij1nx> black_warlock: that doesn't fix the problem
[07:36:27] <hij1nx> black_warlock: its a way to make it so that my page isn't at least broken
[07:36:39] <hij1nx> black_warlock: but i want to know is why `$('body').animate({"scrollTop": 0 }, 400);` doesn't working moz
[07:36:39] <redsquare> Guddu - all you have to do is make an ajax call, populate a div then call dialog on that div
[07:37:02] <hij1nx> s/doesn't working moz/doesn't work in moz
[07:37:59] <redsquare> Guddu http://blog.nemikor.com/2009/04/18/loading-a-page-into-a-dialog/
[07:38:15] <Guddu> Thanks redsquare
[07:38:32] <hij1nx> so no one knows why `$('body').animate({"scrollTop": 0 }, 400);` doesn't work in moz?
[07:42:06] <timwis> hij1nx: Are you saying there's a way to turn on debug logs in jQuery Mobile?
[07:42:36] <hij1nx> timwis: no I'm saying there is a primitive debugger in your mobile browser
[07:42:43] <hij1nx> timwis: what device are you using?
[07:43:05] <timwis> hij1nx: Nexus One (Android) and a Blackberry
[07:43:16] <redsquare> hij1nx try $('html, body')....
[07:43:18] <timwis> But wouldn't those logs show in my desktop browser's debug console too?
[07:43:29] <hij1nx> redsquare: wtf???
[07:43:44] <redsquare> yeah
[07:43:58] <hij1nx> timwis: i don't have either of those devices, but there should be a settings panel for webkit on your os
[07:44:10] <hij1nx> redsquare: no, seriously, wtf are you saying
[07:44:34] <redsquare> errr you asked why body scroll doesnt work in moz
[07:44:36] <timwis> hij1nx: Okay, but wouldn't those logs show in my desktop browser too? (I'm not getting any logs in my desktop browser)
[07:44:42] <redsquare> i said try a diff selector
[07:44:43] <hij1nx> redsquare: lol
[07:45:13] <hij1nx> redsquare: i suppose i should be asking in jquery-dev
[07:45:33] <hij1nx> it works with other selectors, but that's not the question
[07:45:47] <hij1nx> the question is `$('body').animate({"scrollTop": 0 }, 400);` doesn't work in moz
[07:45:57] <redsquare> hij1nx who gives a fuk, it works with html
[07:46:01] <hij1nx> lol
[07:46:34] <hij1nx> redsquare: i do, because every boolean expression is a performance overhead with the application I'm writing
[07:46:37] <hij1nx> and
[07:46:49] <redsquare> what 1ms
[07:47:06] <Eviltwin> Less than 1ms
[07:47:09] <hij1nx> redsquare: pfft
[07:47:12] <Eviltwin> By a longshot
[07:47:19] <Eviltwin> It's on the ns scale
[07:47:21] <redsquare> hij1nx if u care so much why use jq
[07:47:25] <black_warlock> how to add a + button if there is an ul inside a <li>
[07:47:27] <redsquare> go native for speed
[07:47:32] <Eviltwin> If you care so much, why do you use JavaScript :P
[07:47:48] <hij1nx> out come the trolls
[07:47:49] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: I asked you the context for this
[07:48:01] <Eviltwin> But you never replied
[07:48:08] <hij1nx> moving question to jquery-dev
[07:48:20] <Eviltwin> You can do $("ul:has(li)") to select all ULs that contain LIs
[07:48:37] <black_warlock> ah
[07:48:37] <Eviltwin> Then you can .append whatever you want
[07:48:48] <hij1nx> redsquare: `go native for speed` and just sweep the problem under the rug
[07:48:50] <black_warlock> nice
[07:48:52] <black_warlock> lemme try
[07:49:02] <Eviltwin> I'm sorry, what's the problem?
[07:49:06] <hij1nx> redsquare: just change the selector and forget about it
[07:49:09] <Eviltwin> A || somewhere taking too much time?
[07:49:15] <redsquare> hij1nx yeah, do you use $('#id') in your app
[07:49:19] <Deafgoose> can anybody show me the proper format to do a post call with datatype json
[07:49:26] <Deafgoose> $.post("nameCheap.php", $("#domainRegistration").serialize(), dataType: "json", function(data) { });
[07:49:30] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: You want to POST JSON data?
[07:49:30] <Deafgoose> is this right?
[07:49:38] <Deafgoose> return as json
[07:49:42] <hij1nx> redsquare: I'm not writing an app, i was giving hypothetical
[07:49:58] <redsquare> eh, you said your app is perf critical
[07:50:06] <redsquare> now you dont have an app
[07:50:06] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: There is an example if you see ?.post
[07:50:06] <bot-t> Deafgoose, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[07:50:46] <Eviltwin> hij1nx: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law
[07:50:50] <redsquare> scrollTop is hardly a biggy to throw toys out for
[07:50:53] <Deafgoose> $.post("nameCheap.php", $("#domainRegistration").serialize(), dataType: "json", function(data) {}); cant figure out the proper syntax
[07:50:59] <Deafgoose> Im missing something
[07:51:25] <Eviltwin> jaequery: Look at the "Speedup in a sequential program" section
[07:51:27] <black_warlock> Eviltwin: but i have to check if li has ul inside
[07:51:40] <black_warlock> i have to add a button
[07:51:52] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: So you need to check if a UL contains a LI that contains a UL?
[07:51:53] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EXZ9r/28/
[07:51:56] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: http://www.kueckerseedstock.com/images/2006/11-29-06/Catalog_BigDog.jpg
[07:51:56] <Eviltwin> Or that a LI contains a UL?
[07:52:19] <black_warlock> ye
[07:52:30] <hij1nx> redsquare: ok, so just don't use it if there is a problem?
[07:52:52] <black_warlock> if inside that <li> there is a <ul> must set the button to expand it
[07:52:56] <redsquare> hij1nx there is no problem, it works with html in moz
[07:52:57] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: What you have there is a syntax error
[07:53:14] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: If you open that link I sent and scroll down to the example "Posts to the test.php page and gets contents which has been returned in json format "
[07:53:18] <Eviltwin> You can see the proper syntax
[07:53:24] <Deafgoose> alright
[07:53:28] <Deafgoose> I will look sorry for the miss
[07:53:28] <hij1nx> redsquare: you're trying very hard to make it not a problem
[07:53:40] <redsquare> it is harldy the biggest issue out there
[07:53:41] <hij1nx> redsquare: `$('body').animate({"scrollTop": 0 }, 400);` works in webkit based browsers but not firefox
[07:53:58] <hij1nx> redsquare: thats my question
[07:53:59] <black_warlock> i think it was if $('li').find('ul').length > 0
[07:54:00] <Eviltwin> hij1nx: And you can't simply animate $("html, body") like everyone else does because...?
[07:54:12] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/EXZ9r/29/
[07:54:49] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: heh, I'm trying to understand the problem, not ignore it
[07:55:20] <Eviltwin> I believe the problem is that when the whole window is scrolled
[07:55:27] <Eviltwin> WebKit-based browsers consider that a scroll of the body
[07:55:39] <Eviltwin> Whereas Mozilla-based browsers consider that a scroll of the html
[07:55:51] <Eviltwin> Just one of those inconsistencies
[07:56:04] <Eviltwin> That happens when there aren't solid standards for this stuff
[07:56:08] <hij1nx> which is the main value proposition of jquery
[07:56:21] <hij1nx> to add consistency between implementations
[07:56:23] <redsquare> they have to counter every issue against bloat
[07:56:30] <redsquare> and scrollTop is edge case
[07:56:50] <redsquare> with a workaround
[07:56:53] <Eviltwin> First off, jQuery doesn't make any promises about your use of it working the same on every browser
[07:57:10] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: no one said it did
[07:57:17] <hij1nx> "First off"
[07:57:25] <black_warlock> Eviltwin: thats rite but what if i have to put the button immediatelly after <li> <button>+</button> <a href....
[07:57:28] <Eviltwin> If you do $("body").animate({scrollTop: 500})
[07:57:35] <Eviltwin> It does animate the scrollTop property of body
[07:57:45] <Eviltwin> However that doesn't do shit in Mozilla
[07:57:49] <Eviltwin> Mozilla ignores it
[07:58:01] <Eviltwin> It's doing exactly what it promised it would
[07:58:26] <Eviltwin> But that doesn't produce the behavior you wanted
[07:58:29] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[07:58:36] <hij1nx> lol
[07:59:13] <Eviltwin> It's not jQuery's fault, it's your's
[07:59:49] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: I'm not saying anything is anyone's fault, I'm trying to determine why the behavior is as it is
[08:00:08] <Eviltwin> Because there aren't agreed-upon standards for this
[08:00:19] <hij1nx> which is the main value proposition of jquery
[08:00:20] <kborchers> ?cc
[08:00:20] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[08:00:29] <Eviltwin> So WebKit decided the <body> should scroll while Mozilla decided the <html> should scroll
[08:00:42] <Eviltwin> Just like IE decided it should be attachEvent while W3C decided it should be addEventListener
[08:00:54] <black_warlock> Eviltwin:http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EXZ9r/30/
[08:01:04] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: is there a note about this in the docs? that this is a known inconsistency?
[08:01:19] <Eviltwin> What docs?
[08:02:06] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: lol, its here http://api.jquery.com/
[08:02:17] <Eviltwin> jQuery's job isn't to document every browser inconsistency
[08:02:44] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[08:03:41] <Eviltwin> In WebKit, the scrollbar is on the <body> and in Mozilla, the scrollbar is on the <html>
[08:03:47] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: no its not, but it is our job as a community to document details like this
[08:04:00] <Eviltwin> Go write a blog post about it then
[08:04:05] <black_warlock> XD
[08:04:42] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: Karl Swedberg already did it. reading now
[08:04:56] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: you're kind of an asshole =)
[08:05:10] <black_warlock> O.o
[08:05:12] <black_warlock> wtf
[08:05:15] <redsquare> what, he has answered everything
[08:05:24] <hij1nx> "Go write a blog post about it then"
[08:05:27] <Eviltwin> hij1nx: I'm the asshole? We told you how to fix it repeatedly
[08:05:46] <Eviltwin> It's in the comments of both the scrollTop page and the animate page
[08:06:16] <hij1nx> Eviltwin: yea, I got it =)
[08:06:18] <Eviltwin> But it doesn't belong in the body of those
[08:08:46] <black_warlock> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-cross-browser-variance-in-scrolltop-related-calculation
[08:09:38] <black_warlock> Eviltwin: how do i set the button next the <li><butt>+</butt>
[08:11:02] <black_warlock> hum maybe a replace ?
[08:11:55] <Eviltwin> It seens to be setting just fine here...
[08:12:01] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure I understand the problem
[08:14:06] <black_warlock> it set the button on the end
[08:14:08] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EXZ9r/31/
[08:14:23] <black_warlock> when i open it the buotton goes far down
[08:15:13] <black_warlock> try to set it immediatelly after the <li> >>> HEre <<< <a href> My menu <ul> <li>
[08:15:48] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/EXZ9r/32/
[08:15:55] <black_warlock> im watching that replaceWith
[08:19:45] <snimavat> how do i trigger change event of textbox ?
[08:20:14] <firebalrog> type in it
[08:22:02] <Guddu> Dear all...is it correct that load will do a GET while ajax() will do a POST?
[08:22:22] <firebalrog> ajax can get
[08:22:50] <Eviltwin> domino14: .load will do a GET where as .ajax can do any method
[08:23:12] <Eviltwin> Well .load will actually do a POST if data is provided
[08:23:23] <Eviltwin> All-in-all not very controllable
[08:24:47] <Guddu> Eviltwin, firebalrog If i submit a form then what is the way to know if the form action was successful or not? My form code is in http://pastebin.com/2rPVVFBk This form opens in a modal window ( using thickbox ) I want to close the modal window when form action was successful...could you please help me?
[08:26:33] <black_warlock> hummmm
[08:26:42] <Eviltwin> That function on line 9 is called when the AJAX has completed
[08:27:35] <Eviltwin> Check if the textStatus is "success" or "notmodified"
[08:27:42] <Eviltwin> And if it is, it was successful
[08:27:42] <firebalrog> yes and you could check the status
[08:27:57] <Eviltwin> Otherwise an error code came back
[08:28:24] <firebalrog> you should also be able to access the header
[08:28:26] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: ?
[08:28:37] <black_warlock> =(
[08:28:52] <firebalrog> is your modal window a jquery dialog?
[08:29:19] <redsquare> nah he is continuing with thickbox despite my protest
[08:29:19] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Did you see this? http://jsfiddle.net/EXZ9r/32/
[08:29:24] <firebalrog> if so $('#dialog').close()
[08:29:42] <black_warlock> aye seen it
[08:29:45] <firebalrog> unfamiliar with thickbox
[08:29:51] <firebalrog> or term
[08:29:54] <redsquare> yeah, it is obsolete
[08:30:02] <Eviltwin> You can probably even simplify it to: http://jsfiddle.net/EXZ9r/42/
[08:30:08] <firebalrog> lol
[08:30:14] <black_warlock> but the button has to be before the link
[08:30:37] <black_warlock> im trying $(this).after
[08:30:57] <Guddu> redsquare, I am exploring jquery dialog also..Have taken your point seriously.......since this is a already written app, i am trying to make it work with thickbox in the meantime....But plan is to take thickbox out shortly for the longer run
[08:31:00] <black_warlock> and it put button outside <li></li> here
[08:31:18] <redsquare> Guddu Goodo:)
[08:31:19] <Eviltwin> Oh, it has to be before the link?
[08:31:25] <black_warlock> should be <li><button> LInk <ul>
[08:31:28] <lulzilla> what was that open information service which contains information about a lot of topics? It sounded something like open-base, or info-wiki ...
[08:32:12] <Anime> i have to construct a rather large/complex structure that is bound to change rather often. is it better to do it with plain html string tags or objects?
[08:32:13] <black_warlock> aye but button on the left of the link ?
[08:32:30] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/EXZ9r/43/
[08:32:39] <Eviltwin> I presumed you wanted it after
[08:33:00] <rasmusth> any of you know of a good vertical slider?
[08:33:09] <black_warlock> hu ho this is new
[08:33:13] <black_warlock> prepend ?_?
[08:33:14] <Eviltwin> Have you tried jQuery UI slider?
[08:33:25] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Added version 1.0
[08:33:34] <black_warlock> so its old
[08:33:46] <Eviltwin> It's only been around since August 2006
[08:34:01] <black_warlock> XD
[08:34:08] <rasmusth> Eviltwin: yeh it isnt what I need, I need something like slidejs just vertical
[08:34:09] <rasmusth> for a menu
[08:34:14] <black_warlock> omg you know all the evolutions ?
[08:34:16] <rasmusth> that shows 5 elements per slide
[08:34:38] <black_warlock> this is not a man its a bionichal machine
[08:35:24] <black_warlock> vertical ?
[08:35:31] <black_warlock> i got many
[08:35:35] <rasmusth> nice
[08:35:49] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: The version release dates are listed on the Wikipedia page for jQuery :P
[08:35:50] <black_warlock> but any orizzontal slider will have , probably a vertical opt ....
[08:36:26] <black_warlock> i thought you got  it in da brain .
[08:36:32] <rasmusth> hmm
[08:36:35] <rasmusth> cant find any
[08:36:39] <rasmusth> which do you have
[08:36:40] <Eviltwin> http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=jquery%20slideshow&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CGEQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fslodive.com%2Ffreebies%2Fbest-jquery-slideshow-gallery-plugins%2F&ei=OQATT5XuOYLoggewmPn0Aw&usg=AFQjCNEL60_zjBhIu6KZKGZMB1X-N_swpg&sig2=hK_FS9ww9yQMae6yPMLFTw&cad=rja ?
[08:36:45] <Eviltwin> Wow
[08:36:47] <Eviltwin> http://slodive.com/freebies/best-jquery-slideshow-gallery-plugins/
[08:36:48] <Eviltwin> ?
[08:36:53] <black_warlock> but you need big slider ? or menu slider ?
[08:36:53] <Guddu> Eviltwin, I put an alert in that function....Now even if i press the submit button on the form without entering anything, i get the form refreshed indicating the fields which are mandatory fields....But the responseStatus is success ....
[08:37:23] <Guddu> So based on the return code alone I may not be able to close the Window...
[08:37:40] <rasmusth> black_warlock: I need a button at the button of the menu, that scrolls to the next 5 elements
[08:37:50] <rasmusth> look here: http://realen.twopointo.dk
[08:37:59] <rasmusth> the vertical picker to the left
[08:38:08] <Eviltwin> Guddu: Then inside the callback use jQuery on the container to check if there was an error
[08:38:14] <black_warlock> you need a news scroller then
[08:38:24] <rasmusth> what is that
[08:38:39] <Eviltwin> Something like if($("#mycontainer").find(".error").length == 0) { ... }
[08:38:40] <Eviltwin> Or something
[08:38:47] <Eviltwin> Obviously not that exactly
[08:39:41] <black_warlock> why not this one
[08:39:43] <black_warlock> http://www.queness.com/resources/html/scrollmenu/index.html
[08:40:05] <rasmusth> its crazy
[08:40:06] <rasmusth> lol
[08:40:07] <rasmusth> :D
[08:40:28] <black_warlock> you can set it slower
[08:40:47] <rasmusth> well I dont want that, it's way way way too fancy for these people
[08:41:57] <redsquare> yeah but you could adapt it
[08:42:09] <Guddu> Eviltwin, I was able to find the code where the modal window can be closed.....It works fine and i tested it.....I am getting the idea about form submission errors but not completely....My form code is in http://pastebin.com/T3qKeReR it is a form generated by Django....i.e. Django supplies the variables to fill in the values...more like a template....using that form DIV, is it possible to know if it errored out or if save was successful?
[08:42:50] <Eviltwin> I gotta go. Someone else might be able to help you
[08:42:52] <rasmusth> yeh but then i'd be better off coding my own
[08:42:56] <rasmusth> which I will probably do
[08:43:01] <redsquare> yup
[08:43:05] <Eviltwin> I suggest inspecting the HTML
[08:43:07] <redsquare> best way most of the time
[08:43:13] <Eviltwin> And seeinf what's different about it when there's an error
[08:43:28] <Eviltwin> And using jQuery to detect that
[08:43:40] <Guddu> Eviltwin, that makes sense...the html comes in responseText i think
[08:45:00] <Guddu> "This field is required" is a text that always comes in when HTML errors out
[08:46:37] <black_warlock> redsquare  this is what you need http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_vertical.html
[08:51:49] <black_warlock> i mean rasmusth
[08:51:54] <black_warlock> lul
[08:53:29] <black_warlock> i forgot to say tks Eviltwin

[09:28:18] <ggherdov> Hi all. Is there a general javascript discussion channel on freenode (or any other irc network) ? thanks.
[09:29:35] <BrianFreud> any thoughts/suggestions for improvements for this plugin?  It reads cleaner to me, and runs decently faster.  :)  http://pastebin.com/8TTeVKHK

[09:31:22] <aleray> oups
[09:33:10] <aleray> hi, I'm using jquery ui draggable and I get wrong offset calculation if the parent is scrolled
[09:33:16] <aleray> is there any fix for this?
[09:33:34] <aleray> (parent == parent container)
[09:36:34] <garship> Hi. Im looking for a recommendation of a plugin for displaying tooltips, floated to the side of the form, when input elements gain focus.
[09:40:20] <aleray> is is happening only in chromium actually
[09:40:23] <aleray> not firefox
[09:42:46] <Guddu> How could i use jquery to find a particular pattern in a particular div of a HTML returned in response to a Ajax Request? I kno the div name and I know where the Ajax Load callback is.
[09:48:20] <Che-Anarc> Is there anyway I can indirectly preview / be able to offer edit functionality on another server? - a minimal ide for inserting a div layer or img.
[09:51:07] <black_warlock> i still have problems with tags definition on jq
[09:51:22] <black_warlock> all the buttons inside div id ="mob"
[09:51:40] <black_warlock> ('#mob button') doesnt work
[09:52:59] <cybersholt> black_w use a web inspector like in chrome and right click inspect the element and make sure u r using the right selector
[09:53:58] <cybersholt> understand black_warlock?
[09:56:33] <black_warlock> nope
[09:56:59] <black_warlock> jQ has its own selectors
[09:57:00] <cybersholt> what browser do u use?
[09:57:08] <black_warlock> are similar to css but are not equals
[09:57:14] <black_warlock> its not important
[09:57:25] <cybersholt> whatever then
[09:57:30] <black_warlock> im using jQ
[09:57:37] <cybersholt> no really?!@??!?!?!?!
[09:57:41] <black_warlock> i have to select all the butons inside a div
[09:57:55] <black_warlock> the div id its mob
[09:58:15] <black_warlock> $('#mob button') would be but its not

[10:05:22] <webusnix> hi! i have js variable, and i want send data from this variable to url by post request. how can i do that on jquery ?
[10:29:33] <draginx> What's the easiest way to show only a part of a <ul> within a div? ike if I just want to show the 5th and 8th <li> in the <ul> and each <li> had the same width/height
[10:34:41] <redsquare> draginx are they hidden and you want to show them
[10:35:06] <draginx> well im just trying to make a jquery slider but i think ig ot it :)
[10:35:13] <draginx> didn't set a big width on the <ul> element :)
[10:35:23] <redsquare> k
[11:00:06] <BrianFreud> Is there a way to pass an attribute selector an array, and match to anything in that array?  ie, something like this:  someArray = ['a','b','c']; $thisSelect.find('option[data-url=' + someArray + ']') - equiv to ...[data-url="a"] and ...[data-url="b"] and ...[data-url="c"]?
[11:00:35] <Eviltwin> It's equivalent to all three?
[11:00:44] <Eviltwin> Or any of the three?
[11:01:00] <BrianFreud> any
[11:01:13] <Eviltwin> The only way to do that as a selector would be using commas
[11:01:42] <Eviltwin> .find("option[data-url='a'], option[data-url='b'], opton[data-url='c']")
[11:02:23] <joshsmith> if I have multiple .more classes, of which one could have .selected, how can I match whether "this" within a function, for example .on('click'), is the .selected?
[11:02:26] <BrianFreud> Example, I have an array of urls.  I have those urls stored in html5 data- attributes.  I want to get a collection of all elements that contain any data-url attribute which $.inArray(someArray) === true.
[11:03:04] <Eviltwin> You could do something like .find("option").filter(function(){$.inArray($(this).data("url"),["a","b","c"])});
[11:03:14] <Eviltwin> You could do something like .find("option").filter(function(){return $.inArray($(this).data("url"),["a","b","c"])});
[11:03:39] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: $(this).is(".selected")
[11:03:49] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: ah! so simple
[11:03:50] <joshsmith> thank you
[11:03:50] <BrianFreud> sure, but that's messy :D  (and it's using $.data(), not data-foo="" attributes)
[11:04:24] <Eviltwin> BrianFreud: Then you haven't read the API spec for .data
[11:04:32] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[11:05:10] <Eviltwin> So your options are the enormous selector or the .filter
[11:05:39] <BrianFreud> $thisSelect.find('option[data-url="http://google.com"]') is so clean; $thisSelect.find('option[data-url=' + someArray + ']') would be cleaner than $thisSelect.find('option').filter(function(){$.inArray($(this).data("url"),["a","b","c"])});
[11:06:00] <Eviltwin> Well go try that :P
[11:06:03] <BrianFreud> lol
[11:06:20] <BrianFreud> I know...  it'd just be nice if sizzle added that :D
[11:06:29] <Eviltwin> No, no it wouldn't :P
[11:07:13] <BrianFreud> why?  what other result would you expect from  $thisSelect.find('option[data-url=' + someArray + ']')  //  $thisSelect.find('option[data-url=someArray]') ?
[11:07:14] <Eviltwin> $thisSelect.find($.map(["a","b","c"],function(x){return "option[data=url='"+x+"']"}).join(","));
[11:11:51] <BrianFreud> guess my point is, if it works for a string, and all the syntax is there for it, it seems pretty clean, and useful; |=arr  : inArray and arr[n] starts with, *=  arr  : inArray, $=  arr : inArray at arr[arr.length-1], and so on
[11:11:52] <BrianFreud> :)
[11:12:31] <Eviltwin> I think the last thing we need is more characters to escape in selectors :P
[11:12:57] <BrianFreud> we already have to escape string vars in the ame spot :P
[11:12:59] <BrianFreud> *same
[11:17:12] <Guddu> Eviltwin, could you please help me with the last question for today? I have my function in http://pastebin.com/0zkWDZ5X In this, when the submit load request completes, I would like to query if the returned text (responseText) contains any div with this kind of structure <div><ul class="errorlist"><li>This field is required.</li></ul></div>  This will allow me to take action based on if the form returned error or not. Could you please help.
[11:17:34] <Guddu> I could not find how to accomplish this in JQuery
[11:17:59] <Eviltwin> if($("#mycontainer").find("div ul.errorlist li").length > 0) { ... }
[11:19:37] <patcito> hi
[11:20:35] <Guddu> Eviltwin, we don't have to refer to the returned RepsonseText before running this?
[11:20:56] <patcito> what's the best way to check if jquerymobile is loaded? to check for jquery I use window.jQuery, is there a similar trick with jqm?
[11:21:20] <Eviltwin> Are yo still using .load?
[11:21:40] <Guddu> Eviltwin, Yes....load
[11:21:58] <Guddu> Eviltwin, I am still learning how to change it to use .ajax instead of .load
[11:22:06] <Eviltwin> I believe that callback is run after it has been inserted into the page
[11:22:33] <Guddu> Eviltwin, I did a alert(requestText) and it shows me some ResponseText
[11:23:20] <Guddu> Eviltwin, based on if repsonseText contains error, i will close or let the modal form remain open
[11:27:24] <ravenzz> Guddu oh jesus, haven't you solved it?
[11:27:39] <Guddu> ravenzz, Not yet.....
[11:27:48] <Guddu> ravenzz, Almost there though
[11:28:03] <ravenzz> eh ok, is someone helpi you?
[11:28:09] <ravenzz> +ng
[11:28:23] <pifantastic> patcito: jquery.mobile
[11:28:29] <pifantastic> jQuery.mobile*
[11:30:52] <Guddu> ravenzz, Eviltwin was helping me. I am waiting for his response. Would you please have some time to pitch in?
[11:31:13] <Eviltwin> I'm done, I gotta go
[11:31:18] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[11:31:24] <Guddu> Thanks Eviltwin have a nice day
[11:31:24] <patcito> thanks pifantastic
[11:34:27] <ravenzz> Guddu 15-20minutes before dinner I guess
[11:34:37] <ravenzz> do you have a testcase?
[11:34:50] <Guddu> ravenzz, Thanks....I will send you a paste and explain to you my problem again.
[11:35:18] <Guddu> ravenzz, This is my code http://pastebin.com/yWqMQNFz
[11:35:52] <ravenzz> why jq 1.5.1 ?
[11:36:02] <ravenzz> anyway go ahead
[11:36:09] <Guddu> ravenzz, I also tried changing load to ajax but that presents a different problem.
[11:36:56] <Guddu> So what iw as trying to achieve is a Modal Form which gets the form HTML elements through a Django Template as defined in the paste that i sent to you above. The modal form itself is using thickbox class.
[11:36:58] <ravenzz> there is a missing semicolon at line 12
[11:37:25] <gf3> ravenzz: there is not
[11:37:44] <gf3> Guddu: make a *working* JSFiddle illustrating your issue
[11:37:49] <ravenzz> there is
[11:37:57] <ravenzz>           jQuery("#sendbutton").attr('disabled', true)
[11:38:01] * Guddu is looking what is JSFiddle
[11:38:16] <ravenzz> yes a fiddle would be better
[11:38:52] <ravenzz> put into it just the necessary stuffs
[11:39:14] <Guddu> ravenzz, gf3 There is Django involved in generating the form and processsing of form....
[11:39:21] <Guddu> But i will try
[11:39:55] <gf3> ravenzz: :-/
[11:40:02] <ravenzz> gf3 ?
[11:40:30] <Guddu> :)
[11:40:39] <Guddu> I know....
[11:40:45] <gf3> ravenzz: semi-colons are not required to write javascript
[11:42:31] <joshsmith> how can I listen for a click on *just* the element and not elements within that
[11:42:52] <joshsmith> like if I have an a within a div
[11:42:59] <joshsmith> I want to listen for clicks on the div itself
[11:43:21] <joshsmith> do I have to stopPropagation on every element inside individually?
[11:44:45] <Guddu> ravenzz, My thickbox js is at http://pastebin.com/a379gKib and my html where i invoke the form from a button is this <a href="/EMS/items/add_item" class="thickbox none new" title="New Item">New {{entity_name_singular}}</a>
[11:45:01] <ravenzz> gf3 ok, but it is still missing lol I use to use those
[11:45:42] <Guddu> So when i click the button, i get a modal form whose HTML comes from the template i shared.
[11:45:50] <gf3> it's not missing if you don't want it there
[11:45:53] <gf3> Guddu: JSFiddle!
[11:46:45] <ravenzz> gf3 he is using semicolons elsewhere in his code ;)
[11:46:54] <Guddu> gf3 the problem is that Django is involved in generation of this form....So not sure how I could share it in jfiddle.....I can share the complete html though as it shows up on the browser....Please guide me there is another way of passing on releveant infomration for you.
[11:47:11] <ravenzz> anyway this is clearly not the problem
[11:48:07] <Guddu> ravenzz, gf3 Please let me know if jfiddle is absolutely necessary, I am not sure how I could share this thing in jfiddle...please guide
[11:48:07] <ravenzz> Guddu the modal dialog shows up, and won't close after the ajax request?
[11:48:56] <gf3> Guddu: I don't want to read through a million kilobytes of code to find the bug in your code
[11:49:14] <gf3> ?minimal @ Guddu
[11:49:15] <bot-t> Guddu, A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[11:49:20] <Guddu> ravenzz, The modal dialgo shows up....now if i submit the form without entering anything, it errrors out indicating mandatory fields....this is working fine.....But when I enter all values and press submit, the record gets added and the modal window remain open.
[11:49:35] <Guddu> Only that now the modal window is empty...with nothing in it....
[11:50:12] <Guddu> I found a way to close it...alright....but the problem is that it closes the modal window even when the form errored out (for example not entering mandatory fields)
[11:50:37] <Guddu> In both cases, the responseStatus variable is success
[11:50:58] <redsquare> ok so Guddu, when the response comes back - do a selector on the html to see if there are any errors. If not close it, else do nothing
[11:51:31] <gf3> redsquare: ohai, long time no see
[11:51:38] <redsquare> hey gf3
[11:51:42] <Guddu> If the returned text (responseText) contains any div with this kind of structure <div><ul class="errorlist"><li>This field is required.</li></ul></div>  then this means there was some error.....
[11:51:44] <ravenzz> dinner, bbl
[11:52:06] <Guddu> My question is how do i write a selector on returned text to find out that above div
[11:52:37] <redsquare> Guddu so if ( !$(response).find('il.errorlist').length ) { close dialog }
[11:52:41] <aro> i have an interesting problem, when you open one of our pages that has datepicker on it - the background of the datepicker appears down the left of the main page - what could cause that?
[11:52:53] <Guddu> gf3, I agree...I am sorry for my inability to share a minimal test case....But as i learn more...I am sure I would be able to do it....Thanks for the help though
[11:52:53] <redsquare> sorry ul.errorlist
[11:53:08] <Guddu> redsquare, Trying that now
[11:53:11] <redsquare> gf3 whats happened to the old regulars
[11:53:35] <redsquare> Guddu that assumes you have 'response' as the param in the success function
[11:54:07] <Guddu> redsquare, I have responseText instead....
[11:54:09] <gf3> redsquare: still here, just at odd hours
[11:54:37] <PhonicUK> hey all
[11:54:38] <redsquare> ya, they all famous now!
[11:54:50] <PhonicUK> I'm finding something really weird with jQuery and array handling right now
[11:55:04] <PhonicUK> if instead of array['name'] I do array.name, normally thats absolutely fine
[11:55:11] <PhonicUK> if I add this line of code though:
[11:55:20] <PhonicUK> Array.prototype.sortBy = function (fieldName, desc) {};
[11:55:24] <PhonicUK> which should do absolutely nothing
[11:55:28] <PhonicUK> that breaks
[11:55:34] <redsquare> PhonicUK nothing to do with jq
[11:55:58] <PhonicUK> but it only happens to data retrieved from $.ajax
[11:56:11] <PhonicUK> or .json
[11:56:15] <danieliser> how can i pause a links default function to add a custom confirm box?
[11:56:34] <PhonicUK> danieliser, return(false);
[11:56:59] <redsquare> danieliser - hook an event to the link with jquery, prevent the default action on the event ev.preventDefault
[11:57:00] <danieliser> i want it to continue when they click confirm
[11:57:09] <aro> use confirm()
[11:57:14] <PhonicUK> then return whether or not they hit confirm
[11:57:22] <danieliser> ayo: cant really customize it then.
[11:57:26] <aro> its easy
[11:57:27] <PhonicUK> or do the action 'manually' when they hit confirm
[11:58:00] <danieliser> can i store the default in a variable and then restore it?
[11:58:25] <danieliser> or set e.preventDefault = false after i set it sture?
[11:58:26] <redsquare> just lock the url into a closure for the confirm click action
[11:58:53] <danieliser> not always gonna use this for links.. buttons on forms etc buttons
[11:59:44] <redsquare> well that is harder then, u could just unbind the handler then trigger again on confirm
[11:59:47] <PhonicUK> $("#myButton").click(myConfirmFunction(function(){alert("user confirmed! do something");}));
[12:00:10] <redsquare> but if they cancel you need to rebind the handler
[12:00:49] <danieliser> if they cancel i want to preventdefault
[12:00:58] <redsquare> which you already did
[12:01:01] <danieliser> if they confirm continue with default click actoin.
[12:01:09] <redsquare> yes, read above
[12:01:20] <danieliser> so i could unbind the click and then manually click it by command?
[12:01:26] <redsquare> ya
[12:01:29] <redsquare> that is one way
[12:02:15] <danieliser> im looking for something that will work for just about anything for an app im working on.. this way i can use a class on anything to confimr on click
[12:03:20] <redsquare> the above will, except if your using delegated events
[12:04:03] <redsquare> so you could do something with .data on the element and check that in the function
[12:05:05] <redsquare> hard to make it generic and clean really
[12:05:09] <LordThumper> Any way to use $(label:contains('text']) to select only labels with 'text' instead of just containing 'text'?
[12:05:23] <LordThumper> For example a label with 'text2' will be selected too
[12:05:45] <LordThumper> I only need labels with exactly 'text' as contents to be selected
[12:06:34] <aro> i have an interesting problem, when you open one of our pages that has datepicker on it - the background of the datepicker appears down the left of the main page - what could cause that?
[12:07:25] <redsquare> LordThumper you would have to use .filter and do an exact comparison
[12:08:55] <LordThumper> Ok thanks
[12:16:50] <Guddu> redsquare, I was actually required to specify a selector instead of the responseText parameter
[12:17:02] <Guddu> Eviltwin, I did it like this if($('#ajaxwrapper').find('div ul.errorlist li').length <=0) { tb_remove();}
[12:17:12] <Guddu> And it works fine for me now :-)
[12:17:21] <Guddu> Thank u so much Eviltwin
[12:17:41] <Guddu> redsquare, thanks so much for that guidance...
[12:18:24] <Guddu> redsquare, It works fine now...When i get error in the form, the form remains open....else it closes after sucessfullly saving :-)
[12:19:45] <Guddu> I kno it took a long time but you guys were very patient all the way...thanks for all the help....
[12:19:47] <Guddu> especiallly redsquare who was guding me all the way through :-)
[12:20:43] <Jarred> hi all
[12:20:56] <Jarred> How would I get what's being dropped? It's not neccessarily an element or a file
[12:21:42] <Jarred> It could be text, a file, an image, or really anything
[12:33:47] <redsquare> Guddu no worries good luck with it
[12:34:06] <Guddu> :)
[12:34:35] <redsquare> Jarred being dropped where and by what
[12:36:42] <joshsmith> how can I listen for a click on *just* the element and not elements within that. if I have an a within a div for example and just want to listen for clicks on the div itself, do I have to stopPropagation on every element inside that div individually? or is there a better solution?
[12:37:12] <joshsmith> Jarred: are you talking about the HTML5 file API?
[12:42:19] <danieliser> ok so if i prevent defualt in a click function.. how can i trigger('click') afterwards and not use this click function?
[12:42:49] <pringlescan> How's everyone doing today?
[12:43:18] <redsquare> danieliser well you will need to store a ref to the element & event that was cliked before
[12:43:33] <redsquare> then trigger the event on it
[12:43:58] <dlirit> wondering if someone used jquery visualize plugin? with only one element for a pie chart it doesn't display it..
[12:44:09] <pifantastic> ?p @ dlirit
[12:44:09] <bot-t> dlirit, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:45:25] <redsquare> danieliser did you mean trigger the click after unbinding
[12:46:43] <jeffrey_> hi, is there an event that will trigger on a select when I change it programatically (i.e. the user didn't changed it)?
[12:46:56] <dlirit> yep, the code for the visualize plugin is at: http://jsfiddle.net/GpuK2/1/
[12:50:01] <someprimetime> can each() not iterate through data() attributes?
[12:50:06] <kyb> hi
[12:50:12] <kyb> anyone know how to use tortoisesvn?
[12:50:24] <someprimetime> i'm looping through a ul, but for some reason console.log($(this).data('url')); comes up as undefined
[12:50:25] <someprimetime> wtf
[12:50:42] <someprimetime> $(this).text() shows the proper text, though
[12:51:08] <redsquare> yes kyb used it in the past
[12:51:51] <kyb> how do u check in code?
[12:51:56] <redsquare> someprimetime did u store a url data attribute
[12:52:07] <pringlescan> someprimetime, if you know what data attributes are stored on your <li> it'd be very wasteful to call .each on them. Will al your elements have every value you're looking for?
[12:52:08] <kyb> i remember in the past i would have a check on my files
[12:52:09] <someprimetime> redsquare: yep, it's as data-url"foobar"
[12:52:10] <someprimetime> lwoops
[12:52:12] <kyb> but now i dont see that
[12:52:12] <someprimetime> data-url="foobar"
[12:52:14] <redsquare> kyb - you commit it
[12:52:15] <kyb> what happend
[12:52:21] <someprimetime> i'm even trying to use an alternate attribute, but to no avail
[12:52:26] <redsquare> have u got a .vsn folder
[12:52:30] <redsquare> .svn^
[12:52:35] <kyb> how
[12:52:37] <someprimetime> pringlescan: i'm grabbing the url so this function is more modular
[12:52:39] <kyb> i go to windows
[12:52:43] <kyb> explorer
[12:52:44] <kyb> then what
[12:52:48] <someprimetime> it's an ajax tab function that i wrote
[12:52:50] <redsquare> well in your root you should have a .svn folder
[12:52:56] <someprimetime> and there will be multiple on each page
[12:53:09] <someprimetime> it works fine right now, but i'm trying to just specify the data attribute next to the link and grab it dynamically
[12:53:24] <kyb> ok
[12:53:24] <someprimetime> my reasoning is sane, it's just that this doesn't seem to be grabbing that data value
[12:53:26] <kyb> now what
[12:53:49] <redsquare> right click the root -> svn commit
[12:53:53] <pringlescan> can you put it in JSfiddle?
[12:54:15] <Jarred> How do I make an element invisible and take up no room in the DOM?
[12:54:36] <redsquare> .hide() Jarred
[12:55:12] <someprimetime> pringlescan: hold up it may take awhile. it's all organized in a specific namespace and i'll have to strip some shit out. gonna try some other things in the meantime
[12:55:14] <someprimetime> i feel like i can get this
[12:56:00] <Guddu> redsquare, When i use .ajax() and if i save the form without entering anything, the modal form opens up occupying the whole window.....In turn....if i use .load() the modal form remains as it is ... Why should this difference exist in .load vs .ajax() or could it be that I am missing something....? All i did was wrote a .ajax for the .load which works just fine for me at its is now....Here is a comparison  http://pastebin.com/UREVqNRU
[12:56:10] <pringlescan> someprimetime, you're looping through the children of a <ul> using .each and trying to use this to call data on all the <li>?
[12:56:31] <redsquare> Guddu no idea, load uses ajax internally
[12:56:48] <someprimetime> pringlescan: yes
[12:56:55] <pringlescan> someprimetime, keep trying, but always be very cautious of this, it means different things depending on where you use it, so always use console.out to or a breaking point in firebug to make sure that this is pointing to the expected value
[12:57:07] <someprimetime> pringlescan: word thanks

[13:04:27] <bLiNdRaGe> what's an easy test to see if jquery is loaded? i found a blog post to use if(jQuery), but it's causing node.js/express to crash, so i'm curious if it's a valid test
[13:04:48] <bLiNdRaGe> i've only got 1 jquery element on my page and it's not working, so i'm trying to figure out if it's even loaded

[13:19:16] <dw> hey. im cleaning up some jquery UI sortable code, and there's a mystery $('sometable').trigger('update');. I can't find anywhere in the docs what this event might be for. sortable() has a similar sortupdate, but that's not it, it seems
[13:19:42] <dw> looking at the sortable source code, there is undocumented stuff like this._trigger('update'), but again, no idea why, and can't find where it goes to
[13:21:50] <rasmusth> hey guys, I've made something funny here, I'm using scrollTo to create a vertical scroller. My problem is, if I scroll down, and then up, my top-margin on the element I scroll up to no longer works. You can take a look here: http://realen.twopointo.dk

[13:22:40] <dlirit> in the page template I am loading a script.js which defines some binding. when I load content via ajax call like $('.somediv').load('someurl.php'); it shows the content but tables and other objects in there are not being triggered for the binding... any ideas if maybe im not loading it right?
[13:23:21] <dw> gobsmacked that sortable runs to 1000 lines of code
[13:23:24] <rasmusth> you have to use a function that constantly checks for new elements

[13:27:13] <SP33D> with the id so all works but it don't returns the content?
[13:27:41] <rasmusth> SP33D: did you try something else than this as destination
[13:27:54] <rasmusth> systemfault: you have an idea about my problem?
[13:27:58] <SP33D> nope but the span is there
[13:28:20] <SP33D> i have a span that is called load-desc
[13:28:21] <rasmusth> then it has to do with your server your code is correct
[13:28:36] <SP33D> that supplys a id and all this works the for each gets the right span and uses the id
[13:28:44] <dlirit> rasmusth: thanks, works flawlessly.
[13:28:54] <rasmusth> dlirit: cool
[13:29:11] <dlirit> rasmusth: so I need to apply the .live() for every binding? (I have quite a few... any chance there's a global config for this :) )
[13:29:14] <SP33D> no my server has nothing to do with that :( can i any how spezif a debug location
[13:29:18] <SP33D> that i echo or such?

[14:28:29] <danieliser> to do the default
[14:30:05] <danieliser> thinking i just need to do some sort of loop/timer to check if a variable is set.. and when the confirm is clicked sets that variable to return on the  click funtion?

[14:54:09] <CrazyZurfer> I've a problem with a computer lol
[14:54:11] <danieliser> found something like i want..gonna see how it works..http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/12/better-confirm-box-jquery-css3/
[14:54:16] <CrazyZurfer> can someone help me with something?
[14:54:46] <CrazyZurfer> it's a HP 625 and it has all drivers
[14:55:02] <KoVaLskY> <redsquare> sorry i don't understad you, buy panimay in Russian transcription is "understand" =)))
[14:55:34] <redsquare> Nye - i dont? KoVaLskY
[14:55:44] <CrazyZurfer> windows says that  I need to turn on the wifi card, but it dosn't work, the swich has a light on
[14:55:46] <KoVaLskY> no
[14:55:50] <CrazyZurfer> and it doesn't change
[14:55:51] <CrazyZurfer> :S
[14:55:52] <redsquare> ah
[14:55:56] <CrazyZurfer> any suggestion?
[14:55:58] <CrazyZurfer> or idea?
[14:56:22] <KoVaLskY> my English is very bad? )))
[14:56:33] <redsquare> reinstall the drivers CrazyThinker
[14:56:41] <redsquare> CrazyZurfer ^
[14:56:42] <danieliser> HPs and Compaqs do that.. the light by the switch will be orange when the switch is on..
[14:57:08] <CrazyZurfer> already tried to unistall the driver
[14:57:12] <CrazyZurfer> and installing it again
[14:57:29] <redsquare> mightym - look at underscore if you want better array finding functions
[14:57:30] <danieliser> its a flaw in the board software.. replaced several with new cards and drivers.. reformatted etc.. nothing fixes it..
[14:57:50] <danieliser> mobo replacement often works but eventually it happens again.. worst part is it comes and goes
[14:58:36] <danieliser> sometimes turning it off, take out batter unplug then plug back in etc will work..
[15:00:32] <SP33D> can some one tell me whats wrong with this coz the var d
[15:00:46] <SP33D> ont gets interpreted i mean the dataid part
[15:00:58] <SP33D> $('p[name~="+dataid+"]').load('?dataid='+dataid+'&type=ldc');
[15:01:21] <SP33D> i have a function that has a attrib called dataid
[15:01:44] <SP33D> but any how he don't uses data id as value for
[15:01:53] <SP33D> +dataid+
[15:02:40] <CrazyZurfer> danieliser: you are talking to me? xD
[15:04:40] <CrazyZurfer> ah
[15:04:52] <CrazyZurfer> danieliser: yep.. so.. the wifi is dead for ever?

[15:11:47] <DukeDrake> hi
[15:12:36] <DukeDrake> databox.toggle(); works, but databox.toggle(event.type ==='mouseover'); doesn't, though I pass the event to the function
[15:13:16] <DukeDrake> what can be wrong?
[15:14:03] <SP33D> how can i get a var into a selector?
[15:14:18] <SP33D> $("#+dataid+")
[15:14:40] <SP33D> dataid is the var
[15:14:51] <DukeDrake> SP33D: $("#"+dataid)
[15:19:24] <DukeDrake> why do I not get "mousover" events? -.-
[15:20:05] <dw> because you don't have a mouse
[15:20:07] <coldhead> because you are missing an 'e'
[15:20:14] <dw> oh :(
[15:21:09] <DukeDrake> :P
[15:21:18] <CrazyZurfer> danieliser: thank you! good to know that xD
[15:21:19] <DukeDrake> I have the e in the code -.-
[15:21:37] <DukeDrake> But the event is aleays either "mouseenter" or "mouseleave" :/
[15:23:47] <SP33D> thx a lot @ DukeDrake ^^
[15:26:53] <DukeDrake> OH KEY! It worked with -1.4.2., doesn't work with 1.7.1 .... great! :P

[15:50:45] <Katonia> Hi!
[15:53:36] <Katonia> I have some questions about ajax / jquery if you mind.. I am a bloody noob on this topic.. however: is it possible to load something different than a file with ajax?
[15:53:55] <Katonia> like a script which is in the same document
[15:54:51] <christoz> hello, what do i have to know to write or customize a jquery plugin?
[15:55:24] <csmrfx> Katonia: see jQuery .ajax documentation
[15:55:25] <catcher> I need to use the following selector, but only if it's not an ancestor of #RigthCol.  Is :not capable of considering ancestors? $('a[href*='+$urlString+']')
[15:55:35] <Katonia> I did csmrfx.. but I have no idea..
[15:55:45] <csmrfx> christoz: see jQuery documemtation
[15:56:02] <Katonia> what a nice support here *sigh* I do know the documentation
[15:56:09] <csmrfx> Katonia: ok, perhaps then this is too complicated for you and it's best you let someone else to do it
[15:56:25] <csmrfx> (I mean it is dead simple with jquery)
[15:57:08] <Katonia> and how I am supposed to get others to code for me? v-v I also wan't to learn about it to know how to use it on my own
[15:57:11] <csmrfx> I only wish I could get .ajax or .get return the json data as objects and not as a string
[15:57:15] <Katonia> I just need someone who please give me some hints
[15:57:27] <csmrfx> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[15:57:41] <Katonia> grr D:
[15:57:57] <Katonia> ok tell me what of all these ajax commands I need?
[15:58:03] <Katonia>  I mean.. is there nothing like an EXAMPLE?
[15:58:12] <csmrfx> I already did
[15:58:25] <csmrfx> stackoverflow and google have THOUSANDS
[15:59:03] <Katonia> I am still searching for such an example.. well..
[15:59:28] <csmrfx> Every. Single. Jquery. Function. Has. Examples. On. The Documentation. PAge.
[16:00:53] <Katonia> so it is only possible to load external files and not scripts within the document?
[16:01:29] <someprimetime> what's the equivalent of writing thisUl = $('.foobar > ul > li'); if I go thisUl = $('.foobar > ul'); and then target the li elements from that variable?
[16:01:36] <someprimetime> cause i want to save the parent ul as a var
[16:03:02] <csmrfx> looks fine to me
[16:03:28] <csmrfx> $(parentVar).find("someDescend")
[16:04:08] <Katonia> well.. thanks for the help csmrfx
[16:04:33] <csmrfx> what help? help yourself ;)
[16:05:25] <DofLeFou> What am doing wrong here https://gist.github.com/1618127
[16:05:43] <DofLeFou> i have added the json2 from https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js but it still throwing an error on IE
[16:05:56] <DofLeFou> with my ajax post
[16:06:48] <Katonia> okay.. I found the examples and erm.. how do I actually use the script? like.. trigger it by some event e.g.:  <input type="text" onchange="loadFilter()">
[16:07:13] <Katonia> how can I actually get the information from the input (the value) by js?
[16:07:32] <Katonia> loadFilter(get.valuebyid) or something
[16:08:07] <DofLeFou> Katonia: you can try $("#youId").val()
[16:08:27] <Katonia> o.o
[16:08:59] <Katonia> and what is the .val() wwhat do I have to put in there?
[16:09:39] <ndss56> Katonia: you are not being clear. what information from what input?
[16:10:42] <Katonia> I wan't to create a phpscript (partly jquery/js) which does live update if filter options has been chosen (from a mySQL db) and I wan't to use ajax/jquery to update the content when a filter has been chosen
[16:11:07] <DofLeFou> ok .. n?
[16:11:32] <Katonia> for example... search for: <input type="text" id="filter" onchange="filter()">
[16:12:03] <DofLeFou> var foo = $('#filter').val();
[16:12:16] <Katonia> where do I put that? in onchange="" ?
[16:12:40] <ndss56> you put that in your script
[16:13:06] <Katonia> okay.. I will post my snippet later on after trying around..
[16:13:07] <Katonia> thanks
[16:13:51] <DofLeFou> u can put it inside something like this $('#filter').change(function () { . });
[16:14:34] <DofLeFou> or bind to the live event  or whatever control your observing
[16:14:41] <DofLeFou> you are '
[16:15:00] <Katonia> thanks
[16:15:15] <DofLeFou> u welcom

[16:16:14] <DofLeFou> In IE that code does not work
[16:21:13] <Katonia> okay
[16:21:20] <Katonia> I have no clue what I did wrong
[16:21:29] <Katonia> could you please give me a hint on what I did wrong here?
[16:21:29] <Katonia> http://pastebin.com/jX4aWy43
[16:23:34] <Katonia> why is  java easier than javascript.. v_v
[16:24:19] <mathi> hi
[16:24:21] <ndss56> why should it be easier? java and javascript are totally different.
[16:24:35] <Katonia> Of course.
[16:24:54] <Katonia> but the same developer made them? I guess?
[16:24:55] <Katonia> :X
[16:25:33] <ndss56> you guessed wrong.
[16:25:50] <Katonia> okay.. thanks a lot for that information.
[16:26:24] <linusoleander> If the app I'm working on is released under the GPLV3 license, if I want to use a jquery plugin, does it have to be released under the same license ?
[16:28:48] <DofLeFou> katonia: what are you doing here  $(id).append(html);?
[16:29:24] <DofLeFou> that function function update(id, file) in general
[16:31:56] <IAmWill> if i wanted to create a modal dialog window with 3 links in it and depending on which link was clicked, it would update the current modal dialog with the new display from the link clicked.... what is that called?
[16:32:30] <IAmWill> i don't want two dialogs displayed on the screen, i just want one
[16:32:41] <fschuindt> Someone can help me with the jQuery Validate plugin + Ajax? What I'm doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/x27E5eWq
[16:34:38] <hazamonzo> hey folks. i have two divs that i want to toggle (hide one and show the other). I have a button to do this. but when my page loads i must hide at least one of the divs first. when i activate the toggle the divs "swap" but the child content of the originally hidden div is still hidden. What might i be doing wrong here?
[16:34:46] <ndss56> IAmWill: that should be possible
[16:35:38] <Katonia> DofLeFou: I have no idea.. I copied it from the examples page and I have no idea what I should do with it
[16:36:02] <hazamonzo> before i toggle : http://wstaw.org/m/2012/01/16/plasma-desktopv18121.jpg (you can see that the dic c2 and its child elements are hidden)
[16:36:12] <DofLeFou> what are you trying to do?
[16:36:56] <hazamonzo> After the toggle http://wstaw.org/m/2012/01/16/plasma-desktopx18121.jpg (you can see div c1 is hidden fine, c2 is displayed but the child content is still hidden?)
[16:38:08] <Katonia> just simply load a htm file
[16:38:15] <Katonia> when changing a text input
[16:40:39] <hazamonzo> so yeah. tis odd
[16:44:33] <Katonia> well.. good bye
[16:46:52] <hazamonzo> hehe
[16:53:27] <fschuindt> did you guys know where can I find a jQuery Validate documentation with Ajax examples?
[16:55:45] <_xor> Hey guys
[16:56:07] <_xor> Can anyone recommend a good jQuery plugin to fix multiple background images in <IE8?
[16:56:16] <_xor> I'm trying to use CSS3 PIE, but it doesn't seem to be working very well.
[17:07:05] <fulcan> I can execute jquery code when the script is on the page but if I call on an outside script http://pastebin.com/S95MN2N6 like this one  ->  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/535432/  it fails. I have adjusted the line that calls on the script with /  or ../  or ../dir/script  and it still fails???
[17:14:09] <mightym> second try :) js newbie here, can someone tell me if its possible o iterate of a json obj like { obis : { id: 1, 'x': 'bla'}, { id: 2, 'x': 'foo'}}  and  is it possible to get an value of that obj via id?
[17:14:59] <fulcan> I can execute jquery code when the script is on the page but if I call on an outside script http://pastebin.com/S95MN2N6 like this one  ->  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/535432/  it fails. I have adjusted the line that calls on the script with /  or ../  or ../dir/script  and it still fails???
[17:15:40] <fulcan> mightym from what I have read, yes you can. But I am new too.
[17:16:21] <mightym> fulcan: good news, at least thy for a reply here!
[17:16:22] <luke--> is there a jquery-function to get the html as text from a dom node?
[17:18:25] <fulcan> mightym jquery has a json wrapper. I have never used it. Jquery works almost entirely on id and other tags. I saw some examples of what you are looking to do the other day though I am a novice myself with jquery and not finding much success on this channel either unfortuately.
[17:18:27] <fulcan> :(
[17:19:42] <luke--> something like that would work, but isn't there a function for this? $('<div />').append($('#dom')).html()
[17:19:48] <luke--> $('<div />').append($('#dom')).html()
[17:22:55] <[FRB]Ferry> how can i set my charset when i use ('#form').serialize() ?
[17:24:46] <neppel> got a jquery question
[17:24:58] <neppel> actually not really
[17:25:01] <neppel> haha
[17:25:24] <neppel> more like a general question. Is it important to know javascript prior to jumping into jquery?
[17:33:05] <mightym> fulcan: yes, seems here only high class questions being answered :)  i  anyway thank you for your kind help and ill try it in #js  maybe there I'm luckier ;)
[17:35:01] <meoblast001> i have a bit of a problem
[17:35:03] <meoblast001> i have this code here: http://dpaste.com/688327/
[17:35:18] <meoblast001> it gives this error: [20:33:54.242] JSON.parse: expected property name or '}' @ http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/jquery-1.7.1.min.js:2
[17:38:33] <fulcan> I can execute jquery code when the script is on the page but if I call on an outside script http://pastebin.com/S95MN2N6 like this one  ->  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/535432/  it fails. I have adjusted the line that calls on the script with /  or ../  or ../dir/script  and it still fails???
[17:39:27] <meoblast001> ugh, and the recommended fix is dataType: 'json'
[17:39:43] <meoblast001> but when i do that, it makes the POST, but success is never called
[17:40:16] <mightym> fulcan: #javascript answer in a second:  for (i in objs) { if (i.id === idYouWant) return i; }
[17:40:57] <fulcan> mightym they are answering jquery questions there?
[17:41:19] <mightym> fulcan: yes, but thats pure js
[17:42:46] <fulcan> mightym this channel is sooo lame, but I am not a fan of js at all. it took manipulation and bribery to get me to try jquery.  :(
[17:43:32] <meoblast001> the irony is that the post works fine
[17:43:42] <fulcan> and I am really close to hanging jquery up for good.
[17:43:52] <coldhead> strong words
[17:43:53] <meoblast001> if i use dataType, success never gets called, if i use parseJSON instead, with no dataType, it chokes
[17:44:23] <meoblast001> chokes = the error is coming from inside the jquery
[17:44:54] <coldhead> parseJSON handles strings, not URLs
[17:45:08] <coldhead> so you should be passed the dataType stage when you call it
[17:45:11] <fulcan> I can execute jquery code when the script is on the page but if I call on an outside script http://pastebin.com/S95MN2N6 like this one  ->  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/535432/  it fails. I have adjusted the line that calls on the script with /  or ../  or ../dir/script  and it still fails???
[17:46:19] <meoblast001> coldhead: i'm not passing a link in
[17:46:32] <meoblast001> i'm passing in json, the parameter to the success function
[17:46:43] <meoblast001> which is (if i alert it), "{ status : 0}"
[17:47:37] <coldhead> that's not valid JSON: http://jsonlint.com/
[17:47:57] <coldhead> you need to "quote" status
[17:48:07] <coldhead> { "status": 0 }
[17:48:08] <meoblast001> ooh, thanks
[17:48:35] <coldhead> fulcan: does it work any better if you load jQuery before selectors and init?
[17:48:52] <coldhead> can you verify with the debugger that the files are being retrieved at all
[17:48:57] <coldhead> are you seeing an error message?
[17:48:59] <meoblast001> works now :)
[17:49:16] <coldhead> good work meoblast001
[17:49:26] <meoblast001> meh, you're the one who solved my problem :P
[17:49:34] <meoblast001> all my work was just typing quotes
[17:50:18] <coldhead> you still had to do the work :)
[17:50:42] <coldhead> anyway, good work, take fie
[17:50:43] <coldhead> five*
[17:59:29] <joshsmith> if anyone wants to take a stab at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8875070/stopping-propagation-of-mousedown-mouseup-from-a-click-handler
[18:02:05] <coldhead> joshsmith: that's the expected behaviour, and the right fix for it
[18:02:22] <coldhead> the click is made up of those other events
[18:02:32] <joshsmith> I figured as much, but just making sure
[18:02:36] <coldhead> similar with keypress: keyup and keydown
[18:03:01] <joshsmith> I'm having to do mousedown/mouseup to simulate :active state on an element that's not actually being clicked
[18:03:09] <coldhead> gross
[18:03:19] <paissad> hello guys, i would like to center  a div on my screen, here is the div <div class="center_to_screen">
[18:03:22] <joshsmith> it's pure eye candy
[18:03:23] <paissad> here is the code http://pastebin.com/igG6cyMM
[18:03:32] <paissad> but nothing is centered :/
[18:03:34] <coldhead> joshsmith: does it have to be :active ?
[18:03:35] <Eviltwin> paissad: Sounds like a question for #css
[18:03:45] <coldhead> i would try .thing:active, .thing.active {}
[18:03:52] <coldhead> and then toggleClass('active')
[18:04:00] <joshsmith> coldhead: that's basically what I'm doing
[18:04:02] <Eviltwin> paissad: Can you put this in a jsFiddle?
[18:04:09] <coldhead> except with all this icky event stuff
[18:04:12] <paissad> Eviltwin, when i use css, i have no problem, .. when i use JQuery, the result is not what i expect
[18:04:18] <coldhead> well good luck, joshsmith
[18:04:22] <joshsmith> well, I have to stop event bubbling for other reasons
[18:04:29] <coldhead> sure
[18:04:34] <joshsmith> basically I'm recreating Twitter's sidepane
[18:04:38] <Eviltwin> paissad: Why don't you use CSS? That's the "right" way to solve these sorts of problems
[18:04:40] <coldhead> ah nice
[18:05:16] <Eviltwin> You should never need to stop event bubbling
[18:05:21] <joshsmith> I've got it mostly working, but if you click on UX elements within the "tweet"-like element, the event bubbles up and opens/closes the pane
[18:05:42] <paissad> Eviltwin, because i want the <div> to be centered in a exactly, ... i don't know really know what would be the width ^^
[18:06:35] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ paissad
[18:06:36] <bot-t> paissad, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[18:06:45] <paissad> Eviltwin, ok
[18:06:50] <Eviltwin> Also, do you know what $('center_to_screen') does?
[18:07:07] <kborchers> Eviltwin: i will have to disagree with you there. there are definitely situation when stopping prop is useful
[18:07:34] <Eviltwin> kborchers: Not that it can't be useful just that it should never be strictly nescessary
[18:07:37] <Eviltwin> necessary*
[18:08:24] <kborchers> it is necessary here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L55
[18:08:39] <Eviltwin> Why?
[18:09:00] <paissad> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/paissad/dvaq7/
[18:09:08] <Eviltwin> paissad: Do you know what $('center_to_screen') does?
[18:09:37] <coldhead> <center_to_screen>lol?</center_to_screen>
[18:09:48] <paissad> ahhh
[18:10:00] <Eviltwin> It takes a CSS selector
[18:10:11] <Eviltwin> And that's the selector for a <center_to_screen> tag
[18:10:18] <kborchers> all of the event binding is done on the UL. if you have nested menus, you don't want a click bubbling up to a parent menu and firing its handlers
[18:10:53] <Eviltwin> I guess I should rephrase
[18:12:11] <Eviltwin> I hesitate to stop propagation of the browser events in a plugin
[18:12:18] <Eviltwin> Because I don't know what context it will be used in
[18:12:40] <Eviltwin> I don't have issue with the practice of using an event system that involves cancelling
[18:12:44] <joshsmith> I think I agree there; my usage isn't within a plugin
[18:12:53] <Eviltwin> But I think it should only apply to the scope of the plugin
[18:12:56] <frewsxcv> Why can't I get border style information here: http://cfslo.no-ip.org:8001/dashboard/ document.getElementById("map").style.border
[18:13:07] <kborchers> Eviltwin: i can see your point there. i guess your statement was a little too general
[18:13:17] <Eviltwin> i.e. skip the bubbling of the remaining elements of the plugin
[18:13:27] <frewsxcv> Rather, "map-panel", not "map". Or with $("map-panel").css("borderBottom")
[18:13:28] <Eviltwin> But to some extent I stand by my original statement
[18:13:52] <Eviltwin> That unlike preventDefault, the outcome of stopPropagation can be faked without too much difficulty
[18:14:34] <unclemantis> when will the plugins section be open again?
[18:14:34] <kborchers> i'm mostly playing devil's advocate here. i try to not prevent bubbling when ever possible, i just knew of that specific case since i have been knee deep in menu for months now
[18:14:36] <Eviltwin> And that cancelling a bubble is a very global action in one sense
[18:15:12] <Eviltwin> And shouldn't be done without consideration of the circumstances
[18:15:20] <kborchers> definitely
[18:15:29] <Eviltwin> In fact, I'm writing an article about the badness of .live
[18:15:39] <Eviltwin> Since I've had to explain how it works in here countless times
[18:15:47] <kborchers> Eviltwin: you know i love you :P
[18:15:48] <Eviltwin> And why .delegate (or the .delegate-style of .on) is better
[18:16:07] <Eviltwin> So I was actually hunting for a commonly-used plugin that stops progation
[18:16:08] <kborchers> much better!
[18:16:11] <Eviltwin> propagation*
[18:16:58] <kborchers> my favorite though is after you explain the evils of live and then someone comes back with $("body").delegate(...
[18:17:34] <coldhead> i do that all the time, kborchers
[18:17:36] <Eviltwin> Still better than $("a").live
[18:17:40] <paissad> i updated it http://jsfiddle.net/paissad/dvaq7/3/ ... but still not ok :/
[18:17:55] <coldhead> we migrated an entire codebase from .live() to $('body').delegate
[18:18:00] <coldhead> so performant
[18:18:01] <Eviltwin> paissad: Look on the left hand side of that window
[18:18:05] <Eviltwin> To where it says "Choose Framework"
[18:18:21] <Eviltwin> kborchers, coldhead: Fortunately jQuery does some shortcutting for $("body")
[18:18:31] <kborchers> i'll forgive you coldhead since it's perpetually your first day
[18:18:40] <Eviltwin> It skips Sizzle and just returns $(document.body)
[18:19:26] <paissad> Eviltwin, ok thanks http://jsfiddle.net/paissad/dvaq7/4/ ... now the text is centered between top & downside, ... but now between left & right
[18:19:33] <coldhead> thanks jQuery!
[18:19:59] <unclemantis> whats the deal with PLUGINS? when will it be back up? The docs are online but plugins.jquery.com has this coming soon page
[18:20:05] <unclemantis> is there a mirror somewhere?
[18:20:17] <Eviltwin> paissad: Oddly it actually works on resize
[18:20:42] <paissad> Eviltwin, ah ok ^^, thank mate
[18:22:50] <coldhead> no mirror, unclemantis
[18:23:00] <coldhead> github?
[18:23:35] <coldhead> you should be able to find your plugins wherever the authors host them
[18:23:53] <coldhead> somebody accidentally all the plugins
[18:24:10] * coldhead coughs [ajpiano] splutter
[18:24:56] * Eviltwin says all the plugins
[18:25:19] <Eviltwin> A lot of them were pretty crappy anyway
[18:25:37] <unclemantis> it is jquery.autocomplete that i am concerned about
[18:25:45] <coldhead> oh yeah, total blessing in disguise
[18:25:55] <coldhead> in the disguise of a database deletion with no backup
[18:25:59] <coldhead> CUNNING DISGUISE
[18:26:22] <Eviltwin> DROP TABLE Plugins;
[18:26:30] <kborchers> unclemantis: UI has an autocomplete widget, just use that
[18:26:40] <Eviltwin> DELETE FROM Plugins;
[18:27:44] <unclemantis> kborchers i am trying to use the feature from jquery.tagsinput.min.js
[18:28:00] <unclemantis> it says to use autocomplete_url which is a part of the autocomplete plugin
[18:30:27] <kborchers> unclemantis: if it's the autocomplete plugin i'm thinking of, it was deprecated 1.5 years ago and integrated into jQuery UI
[18:30:34] <kborchers> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/
[18:31:00] <kborchers> unclemantis: and here is the github repo maintained by someone else now https://github.com/agarzola/jQueryAutocompletePlugin
[18:31:12] <coldhead> you can't just deprecate your problems away, kswed
[18:31:12] <unclemantis> kborchers do you have an alternative solution?
[18:31:29] <unclemantis> one that will work with the tagsinput
[18:31:39] <Eviltwin> As long as they've deprecated .live, I can rest
[18:31:49] <kborchers> never used that plugin so i'm not sure unclemantis, sorry
[18:31:56] <unclemantis> dang it
[18:32:29] <unclemantis> maybe i will email the author
[18:34:21] <kborchers> coldhead: no but apparently you can accidentally delete them away ;)
[18:34:32] <unclemantis> well this is just great
[18:34:55] <unclemantis> awesome plugin but the autocomplete feature is depreciated and the tag plugin hasn't been updated for just as long :(
[18:35:37] <kborchers> sorry unclemantis, you could try using that other repo of the autocomplete plugin and see if that works
[18:35:40] <coldhead> deprecated*
[18:36:01] <unclemantis> coldhead do you have a better idea?
[18:36:58] <coldhead> unclemantis: only that this is a fine demonstration of a buddhist principle: attachment leads to suffering
[18:37:09] <abjorn> CENTOS YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[18:37:31] <abjorn> "No package git-core available."
[18:37:37] <abjorn> u lie yum, you lie
[18:37:43] <coldhead> there are lots of autocompletey things
[18:37:51] <coldhead> something's bound to work
[18:37:56] <coldhead> see where the fates drag you
[18:39:03] <abjorn> to hell
[18:39:04] <abjorn> that's where
[18:40:05] <unclemantis> i have an autocomplete solution i am using. I am using the UI autocomplete
[18:40:14] <unclemantis> so how the heck do i make that work with the tags?
[18:40:34] <unclemantis> it works fine if i am using just a single input box, but how do i get it to work with the tags?
[18:41:56] <unclemantis> thoughts?
[18:41:58] <coldhead> do you have a link to what you have so far, unclemantis?
[18:42:09] <coldhead> i doubt i can be much help, it's my first day using jQuery
[18:42:16] <coldhead> but showing is helpful
[18:43:19] <unclemantis> true
[18:43:29] <unclemantis> i can gist
[18:43:37] <coldhead> working demo?
[18:43:50] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ unclemantis
[18:43:54] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[18:43:57] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle.net
[18:44:04] <coldhead> bot-t: tell bot-t we miss you
[18:44:16] <Bankzilla> lol coldhead's first day of using jquery ^
[18:44:43] <kborchers> hey, it's not nice to laugh at noobs. he's trying as hard as he can
[18:45:00] <Bankzilla> obviously not pointing at you
[18:45:13] <unclemantis> https://gist.github.com/c723e8bb9667ca24d7dd
[18:45:16] <Bankzilla> seeing as coldhead is in this irc more than me i highly doubt its his first day
[18:45:39] <coldhead> you might be thinking of someone else, Bankzilla
[18:45:54] <unclemantis> appearently line 3 will not work since i don't have the autocomplete plugin. I do have ui.autocomplete and that is pretty advanced
[18:46:52] <unclemantis> like this is the autocomplete i have that works great with a plain text field https://gist.github.com/f7144720f7e48587acd0
[18:47:16] <unclemantis> so you can see, this is not my first rodeo, but figuring out how to get the two plugins to work together is another thing
[18:49:00] <unclemantis> thoughts?
[18:49:31] <unclemantis> and here is the tag plugin i am using http://xoxco.com/projects/code/tagsinput/
[18:55:32] <unclemantis> no one eh?
[18:55:50] <unclemantis> maybe i will email the author of the tags-input plugin
[18:56:55] <coldhead> unclemantis: do that and try again here when it's not a drowsy sunday evening in the great north america
[18:59:44] <unclemantis> lol right on
[19:00:15] <unclemantis> no kidding, they live 4 hours away
[19:00:35] <unclemantis> if it was closer to march i would stop in and say hi on the way to SXSW
[19:03:46] <unclemantis> just sent off an email
[19:03:51] <unclemantis> thanks guys
[19:09:04] <paissad> when using the following code http://jsfiddle.net/paissad/dvaq7/5/, ... my <div> is centered only and only when i resize my window
[19:09:10] <paissad> how can i fix that ?
[19:09:28] <paissad> the problem occurs in jsfiddle and in my code too
[19:10:03] <paissad> if you resized the "result" window of jsfiddle, the text will be centered
[19:14:50] <matthew__> hello, I am trying to do an AJAX $.get to an html page. It looks like the data returned is an HTML string. How can I manipulate the DOM of the string in the anonymous function that I provide to my $.get? Somehting like this: "$("#content p", html)", where html is the string?
[19:15:14] <coldhead> paissad: http://jsfiddle.net/dvaq7/7/
[19:15:34] <coldhead> i thinkk you need to set position:absolute before you compute the widths
[19:15:44] <coldhead> also cache cache baby
[19:16:14] <coldhead> matthew__: $(html).find('#content p')
[19:16:15] <paissad> coldhead, thanks mate
[19:16:47] <coldhead> LUNCH TIME THEN
[19:16:50] <coldhead> BB
[19:16:53] <matthew__> coldhead: what is the difference between the two? The one that I saw came from here: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery#Rate_me:_Using_Ajax
[19:18:27] <coldhead> matthew__: the one i gave you works with strings
[19:18:36] <coldhead> the other form expect html to be a dom node
[19:18:49] <coldhead> and you said yourself you only have an html string at that point
[19:19:03] <coldhead> and $(html) kindly converts that for you into dom nodes you can operate on
[19:19:05] <matthew__> coldhead: thank you for the clarification
[19:19:11] <coldhead> you are welcome!
[19:22:03] <paissad> coldhead, oddly, i your change is effective in jsfiddle, but not in my project :/ ... i did remove the cache of the web browser
[19:24:13] <matthew__> would a $.get request work with static html files?
[19:25:19] <matthew__> clarification: static html files on my local machine - no swerver involved
[19:25:48] <coldhead> you can't get() file:/// stuff
[19:26:13] <coldhead> you need to use a server
[19:26:17] <coldhead> even if it's just localhost
[19:26:27] <coldhead> or lolcathost
[19:26:35] <coldhead> i really am going to lunch anyway
[19:26:36] <matthew__> coldhead: would .load work?
[19:26:36] <coldhead> good luck
[19:26:50] <coldhead> nope matthew__
[19:27:00] <matthew__> coldhead: ok thanks, I'll set up a tiny server
[19:27:14] <coldhead> ajax adheres to the Same Origin Policy, for more on which ask google
[19:45:34] <nicksergeant> I think I've finally lost it. Finally gone insane.
[19:45:42] <nicksergeant> Why in the world doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/nicksergeant/fBZRD/
[19:46:36] <nicksergeant> The anchor's click event gets called properly, but never propagates up to the default to change the URL
[19:51:00] <BrianFreud> Anyone know how this should be escaped?  I've tried the usual, and it's not working.  $('option[data-URL*="en.wikipedia.com"]')  200+ matches for options w/ "http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/..."  $('option[data-URL^="http://en.wikipedia.com"]') or $('option[data-URL*="en.wikipedia.com/wiki"]') either one no matches (even when I've tried escaping...).
[19:54:21] <nicksergeant> Literally, this doesn't work: https://gist.github.com/5bf98e1d96eda7329eef
[19:54:24] <nicksergeant> How is that possible?
[20:05:29] <pringlescan> I want to send a JSON object via PHP with references to variables that my JS script will have locally is there a way to do that without running eval on my code?
[20:06:45] <coldhead> pringlescan: can you just build up the data into a single JS object and then toJSON that?
[20:07:43] <nicksergeant> Found my answer. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694595/can-i-call-jquery-click-to-follow-an-a-link-if-i-havent-bound-an-event-hand
[20:08:24] <pringlescan> I'm using local storage to cache content. I'll have a couple of indexes, namely keywords, categories and some special {variables} I'll be replacing...
[20:09:05] <pringlescan> So now I'm wondering, the best way to reference variables the client will have in the JSON object I'm passing from the server without eval'ling my code
[20:11:52] <pringlescan> For example, the client has an array, I want to set a value in my JSON object to be item 50 of that array. I know if it's always the same array to store the key and that'd be easy, but it won't always be the same array, I'd like to specify
[20:11:53] <coldhead> oh
[20:11:58] <coldhead> thanks for clarifying
[20:12:08] <coldhead> so this demo i've done you is of no use: http://jsfiddle.net/EKhhs/
[20:12:37] <pringlescan> it made me lol, aids.
[20:12:38] <coldhead> in your example, isn't the problem solved by just replacing the array with an object?
[20:12:57] <coldhead> then you can get/set via key, and not some random index
[20:13:49] <pringlescan> prepare yourself. i'm going to try to say what i'm actually doing in as few words as possible.
[20:13:59] <coldhead> oh god
[20:14:02] <coldhead> help my baby jesus
[20:15:40] <pringlescan> I have a templating system in PHP that replaces {variables} with values from and indexes keywords, categories and such. That way when I send things over the wire, I refer to their key in an index rather than the actual content.
[20:16:22] <pringlescan> I realize GZIP compression would do the same thing, but I coded a custom local search function and it works faster when I use indexes instead of string comparisons, so I didn't see a good reason not to just transport the data in the format it'll be consumed.
[20:17:17] <pringlescan> does that even make sense? be brutal.
[20:17:21] <coldhead> so far so good
[20:17:42] <coldhead> if you just want to send the data you could use a client side template engine
[20:17:54] <coldhead> but that's by-the-by
[20:18:32] <StevenCodes22> coldhead, if I had a good idea for a plugin who would I goto ?
[20:18:41] <StevenCodes22> to get help *
[20:19:31] <coldhead> StevenCodes22: you'd do some pseudocode or a working skeleton and then you'd link it here and maybe to forum.jquery.com
[20:19:39] <pringlescan> I think it'd be faster to use my templating system locally to add elements to a hidden div than to just set a huge html string in there and let the DOM do it.
[20:19:50] <pringlescan> I think I'm trying to optimize things too much because I just read High Performance Javascript
[20:20:21] <coldhead> ah, the optimise first approach
[20:20:29] <coldhead> it's better to optimise later, if at all
[20:20:34] <pringlescan> it's too late, i said what I was going to deliver, now I have to
[20:20:44] <coldhead> well, that's a sweeping generalisation if there ever was one
[20:21:09] <pringlescan> there's a happy middle ground, i also battle test my code during coding and take forever to finish
[20:21:23] <pringlescan> my career as a developer will be short if I don't find a middle ground
[20:21:24] <StevenCodes22> hmm alright
[20:21:25] <pringlescan> :-)
[20:21:37] <crab> sweeping cleans floors.
[20:22:18] <pringlescan> so does wrapping a girl in inside out duct tape and doing her on the floor
[20:22:30] <pringlescan> but that's not going to transport my data in an easy to digest fashion
[20:23:34] <pringlescan> coldhead, I think, I'll let GZIP do it's job, and for the variables I'm worried about replacing, I'll use an object so I can stick with a regexp that pulls out keys and knows where to look based on context.
[20:23:43] <coldhead> or win you any fans with conservatives
[20:23:58] <coldhead> good luck, pringlescan
[20:24:01] <pringlescan> we're married
[20:24:15] <pringlescan> tons of people who code and are on IRC are married in IRL
[20:24:28] <coldhead> yeah, right
[20:24:39] <coldhead> i'm surrounded by women right this moment
[20:24:44] <coldhead> and not socially awkward at all
[20:24:51] <coldhead> hey gavin_huang
[20:29:13] <gavin_huang> coldhead, hey, what's up
[20:29:54] <coldhead> not much!
[20:31:05] <StevenCodes22> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/Q3ftH/ I have made the basics, now basically I would like to make this so there is a list of images and you may drag into 3 fixed positions on a grib and it will rate them The first being your #1 second being #1 etc...
[20:31:26] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. Anyone familiar with adding an image caption like function to a div instead of all these libs out there made for images?
[20:32:11] <hazamonzo> I want to hover over a div and display some options a user can click. I've tried a couple of image caption libs but having rendering issues with blueprint and such
[20:32:22] <coldhead> that shouldn't be too hard, StevenCodes22
[20:32:34] <coldhead> i can't help much because i don't know jQ UI very well
[20:32:34] <StevenCodes22> reference to start ?
[20:32:40] <StevenCodes22> ahh gotcha
[20:32:42] <coldhead> what more do you need!
[20:32:50] <coldhead> this works except for reporting what the 3 images are
[20:33:07] <StevenCodes22> yeah but seralize will do it I guess i just needed motivation
[20:33:08] <StevenCodes22> lol
[20:33:45] <coldhead> hazamonzo: you should be able to do that with good old fashioned CSS, no lib needed
[20:33:59] <coldhead> or some very simple jQuery to animate the caption
[20:34:12] <hazamonzo> coldhead: I believe you :) something simple to do you think?
[20:35:14] <coldhead> i do, i am doing you a little demo right now
[20:35:16] <hazamonzo> coldhead: See i've tried this with blueprint but it kinda screws up
[20:35:18] <hazamonzo> http://www.wbotelhos.com/capty/
[20:35:29] <hazamonzo> But its exactly what im looking for :)
[20:35:51] <hazamonzo> instead of hovering over an image i need to hover over a div that contains a chart ect
[20:38:10] <hazamonzo> actually... it coming up to 5am. Bedtime :)
[20:39:24] <coldhead> hazamonzo: look at this in the morning: http://jsfiddle.net/tuTYS/
[20:44:39] <StevenCodes22> very nice @ coldhead
[20:46:12] <coldhead> thanks StevenCodes22
[20:46:15] <StevenCodes22> coldhead How would I change the css for caption=""
[20:46:18] <StevenCodes22> ?
[20:46:20] <coldhead> i do my best
[20:46:29] <coldhead> in the top right panel, the CSS is all there
[20:46:34] <coldhead> the class is .caption
[20:47:20] <StevenCodes22> Oh gotcha see how it works tyvm :)
[20:58:29] <StevenCodes22> btw Note @ coldhead use html instead of jquery that way they can add tags without it showing the html tags
[20:58:36] <StevenCodes22> instead of text()
[20:59:26] <coldhead> oh good point
[20:59:29] <coldhead> well spotted
[20:59:40] <StevenCodes22> np
[21:06:32] <tman> morning, i'm trying to change a series of broken background-image strings using replace and it's failing
[21:06:52] <tman> do i have to convert the string to a jquery object before performing the replace?
[21:08:42] <coldhead> i hope not, tman
[21:08:55] <coldhead> how are you retrieving the broken URLs?
[21:09:04] <tman> sec
[21:09:36] <tman> http://dpaste.com/688381/
[21:09:38] <coldhead> var new_img = $('#div-with-broken-bg').css('background-image').replace(/bmp/, 'png')
[21:09:59] <tman> hmm
[21:10:02] <tman> that's what i'm doing isnt' it?
[21:10:23] <coldhead> mostly
[21:10:26] <tman> but
[21:10:27] <tman> it's failngh
[21:10:36] <coldhead> i bet your regex doesn't match
[21:10:39] <coldhead> so it can't replace it
[21:10:46] <tman> but the console is showing me the output
[21:10:47] <coldhead> er your string
[21:10:54] <coldhead> and it's correct in the output?
[21:11:03] <tman> iu'll double checkk
[21:11:04] <coldhead> in the console*
[21:11:55] <coldhead> i would avoid replacing the url( part with url(
[21:11:59] <tman> cd: http://dpaste.com/688382/
[21:12:00] <coldhead> you're not changing it
[21:12:04] <coldhead> just leave that bit
[21:12:09] <coldhead> and change the stuff you actually need
[21:12:44] <coldhead> i believe the CSS syntax is url(http://whatever)
[21:12:49] <coldhead> with no "s
[21:12:50] <tman> ok lemme try
[21:12:56] <tman> so the console is not accurate?
[21:13:05] <coldhead> the console looks accurate
[21:13:19] <coldhead> it might just be accurately doing the wrong thing
[21:13:23] <coldhead> i'd try this line
[21:13:42] <tman> frick
[21:13:42] <coldhead> curPath.replace('http://tman.ca/temp/images/', 'http://cdn.livedemo00.template-help.com/wt_37252/images/');
[21:13:56] <tman> fails
[21:13:59] <tman> darn it
[21:14:33] <coldhead> tman: do you control tman.ca ?
[21:14:46] <coldhead> why not just do a 301 redirect on that server
[21:14:49] <coldhead> and leave the JS out
[21:15:38] <tman> what i want to do
[21:15:43] <tman> is update the paths
[21:15:48] <tman> then use a tool to wget them
[21:15:53] <tman> then put them on my server.
[21:16:00] <tman> i'm trying to circumvent their setup.
[21:16:06] <tman> i could do it manuallay
[21:16:10] <tman> but that sucks
[21:16:14] <tman> i like these kinds of challenges.
[21:16:17] <tman> ... when they work.
[21:17:38] <tman> hmm
[21:17:39] <coldhead> what you have right now must be pretty close
[21:17:43] <tman> a 301 redirect
[21:18:36] <tman> will that provide generated markup that i can target?
[21:18:39] <tman> i think it will..
[21:18:43] <tman> cvos that happens server side...
[21:18:44] <tman> lemme try
[21:20:42] <coldhead> good luck tman
[21:21:51] <tman> thanks
[21:21:58] <tman> my server side isn't very strong

[22:12:43] <aro> i have an interesting problem, when you open one of our pages that has datepicker on it - the background of the datepicker appears down the left of the main page - what could cause that?
[22:13:02] <coldhead> broken css?
[22:13:25] <coldhead> i don't think you should sell that as an interesting problem
[22:13:31] <aro> well its out of the box
[22:13:32] <coldhead> the 8 queens problem is an interesting problem
[22:13:36] <aro> i didnt modify anything
[22:13:44] <coldhead> do you have CSS of your own though?
[22:13:55] <coldhead> unrelated to datepicker?
[22:13:58] <aro> yea, but none that interacts with that
[22:14:06] <coldhead> is this online somewhere?
[22:14:32] <aro> let me see, its in our customer portal - ill have to check to see
[22:14:48] <tman> cd: updated that to $(*)
[22:14:52] <tman> so now basically
[22:14:56] <tman> all referenced images in the css file
[22:15:11] <tman> will get flagged dumped into an image, appended to the body and then download them all

[23:09:04] <nardev> hello i want to execute 2. ajax request after first one is completed, what do i need to accomplish that?
[23:14:05] <_ramo> hi
[23:20:57] <pronoy> hello, I am new to jQuery and I have a question regarding this http://pastie.org/3193520 . What I want to do is press an arrow image and it the corrsoponding div should toggle and the arrow image should change with that. Also, would it be better if the arrow image was a css background-image? If I want to do the latter how do I do it?
[23:23:51] <nardev> pronoy, do you have html with this code
[23:24:05] <pronoy> yes the normal toggle seems to be working nardev
[23:24:14] <pronoy> do you want to see the html?
[23:24:27] <nardev> pronoy, i don't understand exactly what needs to be done after button/image is pressed?
[23:24:43] <nardev> past html and js in one page
[23:24:47] <nardev> together
[23:25:00] <pronoy> it should hide/unhide the the class and the image that has been clicked should change
[23:25:04] <pronoy> sure
[23:26:16] <nardev> $('SOME SELECTOR HERE)..addClass(' NAME OF CLASS  ');  <- this would add name of class
[23:26:28] <nardev> sorry one dot not ..
[23:27:53] <nardev> also by using mthod .attr() you can change source path of image http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[23:28:05] <nardev> pronoy,
[23:28:14] <pronoy> yes?
[23:28:16] <pronoy> oh
[23:28:17] <pronoy> sory
[23:28:58] <nardev> you just need to select what you need with selector and apply that two methods with appropriate parameters
[23:29:36] <nardev> attr() and addClass or removeClass
[23:30:01] <nardev> pronoy, i hope that would help
[23:30:16] <pronoy> I am just checking it, I'll bug if I have trouble, thanks
[23:30:57] <pronoy> nardev: wait, how can I directly manipulate the css if I don't want to change the source of the image in the html? I mean the image is now background-image instead of the normal <img src="">
[23:31:12] <pronoy> what do I use then? attr?

[23:42:52] <pronoy> okay
[23:43:30] <pronoy> but that would be a problem for the url('')
[23:43:35] <pronoy> or should I leave that be
[23:43:36] <IAmWill> Cork: ehh.. i am not sure what you mean by landing page... if you are asking if i control the page that I am redirecting to, yes.. the site i am building is local
[23:46:32] <poppiez> why isn't the "timeStamp" event prop supplied for the "keydown" event in IE?
[23:46:50] <poppiez> I have to do e.timeStamp = e.timeStamp || new Date().getTime(); right now
[23:48:37] <nardev> pronoy, it would not
[23:48:44] <pronoy> why not?
[23:48:45] <nardev> browser handle that
[23:48:58] <pronoy> oh you meant poppiez
[23:49:02] <nardev> i mean for url("") vs. url('')
[23:49:15] <pronoy> okay
[23:49:42] <poppiez> nardev: what are you saying? that it only works if the browser supports it?
[23:49:49] <_ramo> somehow i have issues with this code in IE7/8 http://jsfiddle.net/TwSfV/  . the IE Console says:  SCRIPT1028: Identifier, character string or number expected
[23:49:54] <_ramo> does anyone have an idea?
[23:49:58] <nardev> no poppiez
[23:50:02] <_ramo> it's on the line where .data starts
[23:50:37] <nardev> poppiez, pronoy was afraid that single quotes in url('') would not work
[23:50:55] <poppiez> nardev: ah :)
[23:50:55] <pronoy> poppiez: sorry for the confusion
[23:51:38] <nardev> pronoy, remember that if you write inline css and you srite ex. <div style="background: url('  path to img ') " .....
[23:51:47] <nardev> than you use singlw quotes
[23:52:05] <pronoy> okay, well fwiw it's still not working
[23:52:12] <nardev> although if you have separated css file than you would use double quotes
[23:52:20] <nardev> that it's why it' ok
[23:52:47] <SpinachHead> If I cut the the whole text from jquery-x.x.min.js  and paste it into an existing javascript file, and then document.ready() below the actual jquery library, will this cause any problems anyone knows of?
[23:52:47] <nardev> pronoy, maybe it' something up to toggle function how you use it
[23:53:20] <pronoy> nardev: http://pastie.org/3193625 http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[23:53:34] <pronoy> nardev: I think I've implemented it right, just checked it again
[23:54:41] <nardev> pronoy, this is not ok ->  "url("../images/collapser.png")"  you must yse single quotes in url( ' ' )
[23:54:55] <pronoy> Yeah, still not working after doing that
[23:55:07] <nardev> and use double quotes for selectors too
[23:55:51] <_ramo> if a generate a html tag like this: var a = $('<a>', {        href: "theRef",	        text: '"' + item.labe l+ '"',	        class: "mySearch",    }); , can i add a class to the a tag like this?
[23:55:54] <pronoy> okay, I'll do that, but it isn't even toggling like before, but let me change the quotes and check again
[23:58:26] <_ramo> any ideas?
[23:58:56] <mindis|wurk> finally got designmode working in firefox. what a ridiculous hack. if you want to turn it on in IE or chrome, you just set designmode = "on" for the document. for firefox you have to first open(), then close() the document and then set designmode = "on" :D
[23:59:15] <Cork> _ramo: yes you should be able to do that
[23:59:34] <Cork> _ramo: its added as if you did it with attr('class') though, but it should work
