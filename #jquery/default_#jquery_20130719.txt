[00:01:27] <MrPink> In fact when you try to open the second pane, the first one closes the second one doesn't open and it acts as if it were open, so you need to click it again (then toggles to status closed) and then you click it again and then it finally really opens with the animation
[00:22:15] <ak5> hi everyone. I am trying to write a jsonp request that gets json back. Problem is that I am getting back a mimetype text/html. How do I force jquery to interpret the request as application/json? I already tried mimeType: "application/json",
[00:22:28] <ak5> Obviously, I can't change the server
[00:23:12] <Cork> ak5: no the response shouldn't be application/json if you get jsonp
[00:23:18] <Cork> it should be text/javascript
[00:23:28] <Cork> as you should get a javascript back calling a function
[00:23:47] <Cork> and no browsers won't execute text/html files as javascript
[00:24:31] <ak5> Cork: I see.
[00:24:50] <ak5> Cork: I am trying to get the json here: https://mobile.yvr.ca/FlightDataService/?format=json
[00:25:09] <ak5> and get the data into my script
[00:25:29] <Cork> ak5: you would have to be able to make json (not jsonp) requests to that server to get that
[00:25:41] <Cork> if you can't you would have to proxy the data over your own server
[00:26:03] <ak5> Cork: I thought that is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[00:26:18] <ak5> (that's also the error I am getting in chrome)
[00:26:37] <Cork> that was the point of my comment
[00:26:56] <Cork> in other words you can't access that data directly from a page on another domain
[00:26:58] <ak5> Cork: proxy the data? How does one do this?
[00:27:35] <Cork> ak5: you fetch the json from the server, and then your script asks your server for the data
[00:28:04] <Cork> you then either ask the question directly (slow) or you prerequest the data, and store it in your database
[00:28:17] <MrPink> Hello, I am using jquery UI and using the Accordion animation. But I am encountering a bug when calling the animation in an iframe. This only occurs in Firefox (not in IE or in Chrome). When you have one pane open and click to open another one, it only closes the first pane, but doesn't open the second. Here is an example http://web248.sv05.net-housting.de/frame/test.html  And here is the code in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/aUSYZ/ 
[00:28:21] <Cork> and then with an interval update your copy of the data
[00:29:16] <ak5> Cork: ugh, ok I thought there was a cool way. Thanks though
[00:29:38] <Cork> ak5: no, cause the server doesn't allow direct access from other domains
[00:29:58] <Cork> if it was meant to be a public resource there are multiple ways you could have used it directly
[00:33:28] <ak5> Cork: so if I do jsonp, I get text/html back. I can't just say "look, it's JSON not html" to jquery?
[00:33:55] <Cork> ak5: jsonp is a way to works around cross domain blocks
[00:34:10] <ak5> Cork: yes
[00:34:33] <Cork> it asks the server for a javascript and expects the javascript to call <function name sent in the request>(<json data>);
[00:34:47] <Cork> this is loaded through a <script> tag
[00:35:06] <Cork> if the server doesn't provide the function call, or a javascript you can't run it
[00:35:19] <ak5> Cork: I am receiving the data I want though
[00:35:21] <Cork> cause the browser expects to get text/javascript for it's <script> tags
[00:35:30] <Cork> ak5: no you are receiving json
[00:35:38] <Cork> and you can't get json through a <script> tag
[00:36:06] <ak5> So there is no way to get this json into my application because of origin policy?
[00:36:13] <Cork> yes
[00:36:20] <ak5> even though I have it, plain text infront of me?
[00:36:34] <Cork> cause the original service doesn't say "it is ok for other domains to consume this data"
[00:36:50] <Cork> ak5: you can store the data on your server and then request it from there
[00:37:04] <ak5> Cork: yeah, that would be the proxy
[00:37:07] <ak5> right?
[00:37:13] <Cork> depends
[00:37:24] <Cork> proxy is if you proxy the request directly
[00:37:30] <Cork> if you store it on your server it isn't a broxy
[00:37:35] <Cork> *proxy
[00:37:50] <Cork> then it's just sending cached data
[00:38:45] <Cork> ak5: but for an as clear answer as possible, unless the server explicitly says "it is ok to use this resource", you can't in anyway access it directly from another domain though javascript
[00:39:20] <ak5> ok thanks
[00:40:04] <px12> is there a plugin to loop through records in a csv file exported from excel?
[00:40:30] <Cork> px12: not sure why you would have to have a plugin for that
[00:41:19] <Cork> px12: $.each(data.split('\n'), function(row) { $.each(row.split(';'), function(column) { /* work with the columns */ }); })
[00:41:22] <px12> Cork: how do I do something like that?
[00:42:16] <cadz> guys, i need a little help here why my tablesorter plugin wont work, its just a simple table with 3 columns http://jsfiddle.net/YuRHK/
[00:42:18] <Cork> or if you want it as a two dimentional array
[00:42:40] <px12> Cork: yes, I want it as a two dimensional array.
[00:42:44] <Cork> px12: var arr = $.map(data.split('\n'), function(row) { return row.split(';'); })
[00:45:03] <cadz> guys, i need a little help here why my tablesorter plugin wont work, its just a simple table with 3 columns http://jsfiddle.net/YuRHK/
[00:45:51] <Cork> cadz: fix the dependencies in the fiddle first
[00:46:20] <slax0r> Hi, would this be a good place to ask a question about fancybox?
[00:46:21] <Cork> pick the jquery library on the left, and add the sorter as an external resource in the section a little lower down
[00:46:25] <cadz> Cork: aside from the dependencies, cant you spot a possible error why the code wont work?
[00:46:33] <px12> how the heck do I store my multiple line csv data to a string in js?
[00:46:42] <px12> Cork: any idea?
[00:46:54] <cadz> Cork: i dont understand what you said
[00:46:58] <Cork> cadz: no i can't
[00:47:19] <cadz> Cork: what you mean pick the jquery on the left?
[00:47:32] <Cork> px12: why do you want to store it as a raw csv?
[00:47:47] <Cork> px12: if you want it static, make the convertion and store it as the array directly
[00:48:17] <Cork> cadz: yes, and add your tablesorter plguin in the external resources list (with a valid url)
[00:52:41] <MrPink> anyone have any idea for my problem with jquery UI Accordion in Firefox: Here is an example http://web248.sv05.net-housting.de/frame/test.html  And here is the code in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/aUSYZ/
[00:55:47] <zach1> jquery
[00:57:26] <Cork> MrPink: please define "problem"
[00:58:26] <Cork> MrPink: runs fine here http://jsfiddle.net/aUSYZ/1/
[01:40:24] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/Uc6gK/   Start & Stop works fine ... but then when pressing Start the second time .. the box doesn't stay ... why is this ?
[01:51:22] <petermanser> @ph88: you need to deregister the event 'transitioned'… http://jsfiddle.net/Uc6gK/1/
[01:51:28] <petermanser>     $('#test').off('transitionend');
[02:08:01] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone tell me why the tabs don't click as they should here: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/a-modern-romance-rsvp.html no errors in console :x
[02:10:34] <MrPink> Cork: Thanks for answering, I sadly had a disconnect before I could read your answer completely... the code you sent in jsfiddle wasn't in an iframe... the problem is somehow connected to the iframe... and like I said exclusively with Firefox
[02:11:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: where are you binding the listener?
[02:12:12] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  It's a theme I downloaded, I think it's conflicting somewhere but cannot determine where
[02:12:34] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: something is killing the event for clicking the button
[02:13:09] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Can you tell what?
[02:13:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: not without knowing where the event is
[02:13:56] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, there's this just above the HTML jQuery(function($){$("#goto-reviews, #goto-reviews-form").click(function(){if($("#product-tabs").hasClass("accor")){$("#product-tabs .tabs-panels").data("tabs").click($(".tabs-panels .acctab").index($("#acctab-tabreviews")))}else{$("#product-tabs .tabs").data("tabs").click($("#tab-tabreviews").index())}})});
[02:15:00] <fRAiLtY-> And I think http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/js/infortis/jquery/plugins/jquery.tabs.min.js is the include
[02:18:37] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you have to reduce the problem
[02:18:53] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it is too much html and code, and i don't know what it is suppose to do
[02:19:17] <fRAiLtY-> kk
[02:20:40] <cruisemaniac> Hello.. I am making an ajax post request and am noticing some unexpected behaviour... can someone help me with this please?
[02:20:42] <MrPink> Cork: Getting a working accordion example isn't the problem. But once the elements that are supposed to be animated with accordion are in an iframe, it doesn't work as expected (see example: http://web248.sv05.net-housting.de/frame/test.html )
[02:20:49] <cruisemaniac> this is the code I'm using to make the request: http://codetidy.com/6245/
[02:21:36] <cruisemaniac> If I set this: "contentType: application/json;charset=UTF-8" line, then the X-Requested-With header is not sent... and hence, my backend code checking if the request is an xhr fails...
[02:21:47] <cruisemaniac> what am i not understanding right about ajax post requests?
[02:23:00] <cruisemaniac> hello???
[02:23:08] <Cork> cruisemaniac: you can set the header manually; though not sure why it isn't cause of that pref
[02:23:26] <Cork> (also don't be in such a rush)
[02:23:53] <Cork> don't expect ppl to answer you question the same minute you ask it...
[02:28:55] <adk_> Hi I'm trying to nest Jqueryui autocomplete widgets that is use the first autocomplete result to determine the source for a second seperate autocomplete widget. Does anyone know of an example implementation?
[02:30:09] <cruisemaniac> @Cork yes I understand... and No! I'm not in a hurry.. Apparently, removing charset=UTF-8 from contentType: application/json set the header again
[02:30:16] <Cork> adk_: not sure where there would be a problem
[02:30:35] <Cork> adk_: just use the completed value from the first one in the source function for the other one
[02:31:32] <adk_> I can set a global variable with the result from the 1st autocomplete but this then isn't picked up as the source for the 2nd
[02:33:07] <ph88> petermanser: why do i need to deregister that event ?
[02:33:46] <petermanser> ph88: because you don't want to hide the element, after a start animation is finished, right? (that's your problem now)
[02:34:59] <petermanser> but there's also an event handle for that, called "one": http://jsfiddle.net/Uc6gK/2/
[02:35:01] <ph88> yes that's the problem and the solution. I meant to know it from a technical perspective ...
[02:35:32] <ph88> why does it have to get turned off ?
[02:35:44] <petermanser> ah, because the element now has an event handler attached, which does trigger this method, as soon as a transition has finished (also the "starting" is a transition)
[02:36:18] <ph88> ah right i see ... makes sense thx
[02:36:29] <petermanser> np
[02:36:47] <petermanser> so use the event handler "one" (see http://jsfiddle.net/Uc6gK/2/)
[02:37:04] <petermanser> it only triggers the event once, and deregisters itself: http://api.jquery.com/one/
[02:50:28] <ph88> yes im using the one !
[02:51:01] <ph88> the one and only xD
[03:28:03] <rosieres> I have a curious problem I cannot explain  to myself http://jsfiddle.net/dtMNU/2/ -> Only in IE if the link is relative it is appended to my actual position so if I were on http://foo.com/1 and click on link with relative path "/2" it is appended this like http://foo.com/1/2 but it should be a substitution. This only happens in IE and does not happen in FF nor Chrome
[03:28:17] <adk_> Cork: Thanks for confirming what I am trying to do is the correct approach. I'll see if I can spot what I'm missing in my implementation
[03:29:27] <rosieres> and additionally my tlink variable is put to console.log correctly . . .
[03:34:09] <shoky> rosieres: works fine for me
[03:35:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Why is this not working? ("li#photoshop-item").addClass("txt_blue");
[03:35:36] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  $ ?
[03:36:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> got that, just didn't paste
[03:36:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $("li#photoshop-item").addClass("txt_blue");
[03:36:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if i add it manually to the li, it does turn blue
[03:36:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so the class is working
[03:36:50] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[03:36:56] <shoky> we have no way of knowing otherwise
[03:36:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[03:39:02] <rosieres> shoky: in fiddle yes . . . with that URL . . . I cannot reproduce the relative thing in fiddle
[03:39:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Well in Fiddle it works :-|
[03:39:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/QEKzB/
[03:39:46] <shoky> both of ya:  oh well.
[03:40:44] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: huh
[03:40:53] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  take another look at your fiddle...
[03:41:00] <rosieres> ecky--ptang-zoob: perhaps your ID isnt unique @ your production
[03:41:23] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: you have the class on it already on the HTML, and you're using the wrong ID anyway in the JS
[03:41:28] <shoky> or in the HTML
[03:41:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh right, damnb
[03:41:46] <rosieres> and have no jquery enabled :-)
[03:41:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/QEKzB/1/
[03:42:00] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: wrong ID
[03:42:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> photoshop-item?
[03:42:11] <shoky> and no jquery :)
[03:42:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jquery is enabled, i didn't paste it here
[03:42:36] <shoky> you dont paste jquery in jsfiddle, you jus choose it on the left
[03:42:37] <rosieres> ecky--ptang-zoob: -> works -> http://jsfiddle.net/QEKzB/3/
[03:42:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i don't see what's wrong with the id, it's exactly the same, no?
[03:42:46] <shoky> blind much?
[03:42:50] <rosieres> ecky--ptang-zoob: no it´s not
[03:42:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> LOL
[03:42:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah ok i'm blind
[03:42:58] <rosieres> shop and ship
[03:43:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[03:43:33] <rosieres> shoky: back to my one - any idea on that with relative ?
[03:43:45] <shoky> rosieres: not without seeing it happen
[03:44:46] <rosieres> shoky: I tinker something after lunch ! . . . thanks so far !
[03:45:00] <shoky> bon apetit
[03:45:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ni!
[03:50:01] <shoky> ni
[03:52:27] <jGuestTemp> Hello. Could someone help me? I have class with two methods: this.init() and this.highlight(). In init() I have event, for example: $("input.one").on( "keyup", this.highlight ); but "this" has value different to my class. Anyone? Thanks
[03:54:02] <shoky> jGuestTemp: one way is:   $("input.one").on( "keyup", this.highlight.bind(this) );
[03:54:43] <shoky> though "this" should really be the element where the event happened, in event handlers
[03:54:58] <jGuestTemp> Let me try it. Thanks
[03:55:00] <jGuestTemp> :)
[03:55:43] <ipwa> hey guys I don't understand why the first level accordion works well, but the second level (from the second click function) doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/PEFWc/3/
[03:55:49] <ipwa> any help greatly appreciated
[03:57:01] <jGuestTemp> Thank you, shoky!
[04:04:41] <shoky> ipwa: $this.parent().next();  is wrong in the 2nd click handler
[04:05:23] <shoky> ipwa: the parent is .view-grouping-content  which doesn't have a next sibling
[04:12:35] <rosieres> shoky: I´m still not @ the dish . . . but I plainly opened jsfiddle.net in IE10 switched to jquery 2.0.2 and it runs into an acceess denied script error  . . . funny . ..
[04:13:24] <shoky> rosieres: ya some jq versions have some probs in jsfiddle. use another version or something, or include it manually

[04:28:25] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have troubles with "on" function. i have modified html content in table > tbody by ajax, but click events not triggered in this area after
[04:28:30] <MrS1lentcz> what can i do?
[04:29:10] <ipwa> shoky: sorry still a bit of a newbie, I see what you mean, but what could I change that to for it to work?
[04:29:16] <ipwa> shoky++
[04:29:27] <ipwa> don't know if there's karma in this channel
[04:31:18] <ipwa> or do I need to change the markup?
[04:33:49] <shoky> ipwa:  $this.next()  instead of $this.parent().next()
[04:34:11] <shoky> there's karma everywhere ;P
[04:34:37] <ipwa> shoky: dude I love you, lol
[04:34:42] <ipwa> thank you ever so much
[04:34:46] <ipwa> you totally rule

[04:44:12] <fruit_pizza> I need a nice image upload tool, where in a particular page I can upload images and view them on a thumbnail organized manner. Could be on a shadowbox, or lighbox of some kind perhaps, or on the actual page
[04:44:40] <fruit_pizza> any ideas?
[04:45:39] <MrTool> fruit_pizza: try using blueimp jquery file upload
[04:48:56] <fruit_pizza> yeah that's a nice tool I have used it before, good call
[04:49:59] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have troubles with "on" function. i have modified html content in table > tbody by ajax, but click events not trigger in this area after, what can i do, please?
[04:51:25] <fruit_pizza> MrS1lentcz: Check to see if the elements actually exist. Since ajax is asynchronous, the order of your lines of code will not reflect the order in which ajax-served data/elemens will be available to use.
[04:57:38] <MrS1lentcz> fruit_pizza: yeah, they already exist. this ajax event provide only sorting of elements in table. $(document).key* functions work inside this area...
[05:00:18] <fruit_pizza> MrS1lentcz: I see, it's never easy lol. I think something like this we'll probably need to visualize the code, do you have a jsfiddle of the snippet?
[05:04:25] <fruit_pizza> MrS1lentcz: when you sort the table, are you detaching/ appending elements? I can't help but to thing that something is overriding or killing your the ev listeners you had before the sorting
[05:05:00] <MrS1lentcz> fruit_pizza: oh, there is many dependencies, i am using this library: https://github.com/vojtech-dobes/nette.ajax.js/blob/master/nette.ajax.js#L219 and this is my code (not important): http://jsfiddle.net/8dRTW/
[05:05:58] <MrS1lentcz> fruit_pizza: first library detects json response and set ever "snippet" to target div with the same name of identifier...
[05:08:55] <MrS1lentcz> fruit_pizza: i mean line 229 direct to bottom is imporant only...
[05:09:58] <mobile8> how come mouseover function does not work on svg <path>?
[05:16:52] <fruit_pizza> MrS1lentcz: Cool, I see! The only things I can see: Place your 'sort projects' code inside of the "complete:" method, so ensure it gets executed after the call is complete. Also, to avoid the use of the Sizzle engine, use $('#projects').find('th'), it will be faster. Sorry I wasnt that much help, i'm off to work. Best of luck on the problem!
[05:28:20] <Gorkyman> hey guys... is there a way to change the template that ui.dialog/widget is using?
[05:33:15] <Krambiorix> can someone tell me what this means? $("#myaddressees input").data("ui-autocomplete")._renderItem(....)
[05:36:07] <noregret> i'm using windows.open() to open a new tab with some info, and it is being detected as a popup and gets blocked, any way around that ?
[05:48:16] <Unode> Hi everyone
[05:49:19] <Unode> Does jquery keep track of how many elements are being animated at a given time?
[05:49:57] <Unode> I know I could use :animated but I would like to avoid having to launch it blindly in a loop and wait for it to be empty
[05:50:50] <Unode> and I want to trigger an event only when all animations are done
[06:00:49] <Sendoushi> ajpiano: just watched your conference. good one :)
[06:02:13] <ajpiano> thanks Sendoushi
[06:02:19] <ajpiano> did you watch the one from portland or UK :)
[06:02:39] <Sendoushi> good question... UK i guess. on youtube is dated july 2013 (i think)
[06:03:11] <Sendoushi> i'm one more of those that started on javascript with jquery as did you
[06:03:25] <ajpiano> oh i think that's the portland one
[06:03:49] <Sendoushi> yep you're right sorry. portland.
[06:03:59] <ajpiano> ah, i haven't watched the portland recording, only the uk one :p
[06:04:09] <ajpiano> i wonder if they edited out the technical difficulties
[06:04:16] <Sendoushi> they didn't :D
[06:04:23] <Sendoushi> is your laptop alive? or did you smash it?
[06:04:24] <ajpiano> oh this seems like fun to watch
[06:05:15] <Sendoushi> if it was me... i think i would explode. so... good for you there! eheh
[06:06:20] <ajpiano> haha this is funny to watch
[06:06:34] <ajpiano> thank god for having put slides online in advance
[06:06:54] <Sendoushi> indeed. did you use some framework or something for the slideshow?
[06:07:34] <ajpiano> yea it's just the google html5 slides from google io
[06:07:36] <ajpiano> like 2 years go
[06:07:49] <Sendoushi> now... listening to douglas crockford presentations and such... trying to improve my front-end knowledge
[06:08:04] <ajpiano> https://code.google.com/p/html5slides/
[06:08:07] <Sendoushi> i see. i see
[06:08:31] <Sendoushi> that will be interesting for the classes i'm giving
[06:08:35] <Sendoushi> useful
[06:08:37] <Sendoushi> thanks
[06:11:13] <Sendoushi> by the way... do you recommend a good javascript book? i'm not a beginner and been coding for some years. i need a book to best my organizing and such. already have the javascript the good parts
[06:11:40] <Sendoushi> to learn how to work in a team environment and such
[06:13:56] <ajpiano> hmm
[06:14:05] <ajpiano> javascript patterns by stoyan stefanov is good
[06:14:16] <ajpiano> going to the store bbiaf
[06:14:56] <Sendoushi> javascript patterns, i'll check it. easy to read? i bought the actionscript design patterns (when i was into as) and well... tough to swallow!
[06:15:25] <Sendoushi> there is another o'reilly one, maintaneable javascript or something like that. have you read it?
[06:34:17] <sudo2k12> any jquery image change on mouse over who are really fast ?
[06:35:59] <Sendoushi> sudo2k12: really fast as in performance?
[06:36:33] <Sendoushi> or are you thinking on loading the image on the fly?
[06:41:45] <mobile8> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17568964/mouseover-event-on-svg-path-doesnt-fire-properly-in-firefox
[06:41:58] <mobile8> Does anyone know about this, mouseover not properly working on svg <path>'s?
[06:50:00] <Donmartini> ey I have a bar that I want to attach to the bottom of my menu bar when the user scrolls down the page. at the moment it works but only when the bar gets to the top of the document and not when it touches the menu bar here is my code
[06:50:01] <Donmartini> http://pastebin.com/sy3kuN07
[06:50:16] <Donmartini> any help on this would be greatly appreciated
[07:00:04] <naquad> can somebody please point me at plugin that actually serializes form? default serialize and serializeArray are buggy (checkboxes, display:none elements are still serialized)
[07:01:24] <shock_one> Hi. Why when I use ajax request to get this page I get a 302 redirect? http://emeraldvapor.com/store/mn/richfield/pos/?controller=login&action=login
[07:02:15] <shock_one> Here's the request https://gist.github.com/anonymous/eb474eb56dd020393727
[07:03:16] <shock_one> Oh, I use POST instead of GET. Now everything works.
[07:04:21] <tamarche> naquad: did you try disabling input fields?
[07:04:30] <naquad> what?
[07:07:50] <tamarche> serialize only ignores disabled inputs
[07:08:01] <tamarche> display: none does nothing
[07:08:07] <Donmartini> anyone have at look at this code yet?
[07:08:08] <Donmartini> http://pastebin.com/sy3kuN07
[07:08:46] <Donmartini> so instead of bar sticking to position when it gets to the top of the page i want i to stick when it ge to the menu bar which s also fixed
[07:30:53] <fesener_> hi everyone, i've a pretty newbie question, in order to ensure having unique values in an object what can I do ?
[07:31:15] <fesener_> my "rooms" object has currently this content:
[07:31:16] <fesener_> { radiant_team: [ 'root', 'root' ],
[07:31:16] <fesener_>   dire_team: [ 'test2', 'test2' ],
[07:31:17] <fesener_>   online_users: [] }
[07:31:47] <fesener_> i want to prevent having more than 1 same item in those arrays
[07:31:58] <BillCriswell> fesener_: Post it to jsfiddle.net
[07:32:56] <_jo_> fesner_: Underscore has uniq.  I bet query has something similar.
[07:32:57] <fesener_> BillCriswell, what information do you need so i can paste it to there
[07:32:59] <_jo_> *jquery
[07:33:06] <fesener_> because this is a huge client/server code i have
[07:33:12] <_jo_> foo = _.uniq(foo)
[07:33:24] <fesener_> my server doesnt use jquery
[07:33:31] <fesener_> do you know how to do it in pure javascript
[07:33:36] <_jo_> fesener_: foo = $.unique(foo);
[07:33:40] <fesener_> i use jquery only on client but those objects are defined in server
[07:33:41] <_jo_> Oh.  Pure JS?
[07:33:54] <BillCriswell> fesener_: Are you using node?
[07:33:57] <fesener_> yes
[07:34:39] <fesener_> to both of you :)
[07:34:58] <systemfault> :/
[07:35:07] <systemfault> Why do you ask on the jQuery channel then?
[07:35:33] <fesener_> thought there were people know javascript here
[07:35:37] <fesener_> :)
[07:35:39] <systemfault> No :P
[07:35:47] <BillCriswell> I never heard of the stuff.
[07:35:47] <fesener_> where should I ask this?
[07:35:49] <systemfault> But seriously, JS has nothing included for that
[07:35:55] <_jo_> Well, there's the brute force stuff.
[07:35:58] <BillCriswell> #node.js
[07:36:02] <systemfault> fesener_: I would try #Javascript
[07:36:08] <fesener_> this is not node realted either
[07:36:09] <_jo_> You can do it in O(n^2) easily.
[07:36:11] <BillCriswell> fesener_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array
[07:36:15] <fesener_> oh is there a #javascript.. ok thanks
[07:36:22] <systemfault> I personally use an object to do that.
[07:36:29] <_jo_> And #nodejs, as Bill pointed out.
[07:36:37] <BillCriswell> second answer looks a lot better than the answer marked "answer"
[07:36:42] <BillCriswell> That's such aweird thing to say.
[07:36:54] <fesener_> and its not jquery either
[07:37:01] <fesener_> ill check it out thank you
[07:37:10] <_jo_> Fesner: idea.
[07:37:12] <BillCriswell> second answer is using plain javascript
[07:37:34] <_jo_> Sort the array, check adjacent elements after each insertion.  That will make things take O(n log n) instead of O(n^2).
[07:37:38] <_jo_> It's a prettier solution.
[07:37:59] <fesener_> actually what i want is not to uniquefy some existing array
[07:38:11] <BillCriswell> You can use underscore in node.
[07:38:27] <fesener_> i want to keep it unique from the beginning so it doesnt add a value if it already exists on any 3 of arrays in that object
[07:38:57] <_jo_> You can check before hand for the naïve solution.
[07:39:05] <_jo_> Not graceful, but effective.
[07:39:12] <BillCriswell> fesener_: if( array.indexOf(value) === -1 ) array.push(value)
[07:40:06] <fesener_> thank you guys so much i'll try them now
[07:40:12] <BillCriswell> var _ = require('underscore'); var unique = _.uniq(array);
[07:40:25] <systemfault> underscore sucks on the server..
[07:40:30] <_jo_> Bill's solution is the best, I think, as far as readability is concerned.  (The if(array.indexOf…))
[07:40:34] <systemfault> I mean, you can fully use ES5 there
[07:40:37] <_jo_> Since it doesn't require any extra libraries.
[07:40:45] <_jo_> And it's pretty obvious what's being done.
[07:40:53] <_jo_> Future employees won't curse your name.  :)
[07:41:30] <fesener_> _jo_, do you have any node knowledge? i can show you my website to show the real problem
[07:41:31] <systemfault> My only must-have utility lib on node is q.js, I couldn't live without it
[07:41:48] <fesener_> i'll not show code just show the issue on the website to you and explain it
[07:41:51] <fesener_> maybe you can help me better
[07:42:01] <_jo_> fesener_: I don't.  :(  But Bill's code is really the best way to solve this problem.
[07:42:19] <fesener_> the problem is i'm not sure if thats the problem with my arrays or my jquery client
[07:42:35] <fesener_> those content of arrays are coming from a content of a div in my client
[07:42:47] <fesener_> but in some situations t
[07:42:52] <fesener_> there populates duplicates
[07:42:55] <fesener_> of those divs
[07:42:58] <_jo_> Open up the developer console in Chrome or Firebug in Firefox.
[07:43:00] <fesener_> which shouldnt happen
[07:43:05] <_jo_> Under the network panel, check what's coming off the server.
[07:43:05] <fesener_> i've done them
[07:43:13] <fesener_> i just cant figure it out
[07:43:22] <_jo_> You should be able to see the response from the server when the problem pops up, right?
[07:43:33] <_jo_> If so, check if the inbound message has the duplicates.
[07:43:45] <fesener_> what do you want me to check ?
[07:44:01] <_jo_> Under the network panel, look for the API/Network call that gets the data.
[07:44:01] <fesener_> there's no error and I do console.log stuff
[07:44:12] <fesener_> i see my array is getting populatedby unique values
[07:44:20] <fesener_> but dont know if thats client or server problem
[07:44:33] <_jo_> That's what we're trying to figure out.
[07:44:34] <fesener_> i dont know which one populates those duplicates
[07:44:37] <fesener_> hmm
[07:44:40] <fesener_> let me check that
[07:45:43] <_jo_> On Chrome, under network, you should be able to see the loading operation -- the URL is on the left with the page name as th etitle.
[07:46:13] <_jo_> If you click on that, you can see the response data under the tabs.
[07:49:18] <Krambiorix> what's the best way to cache content in jquery?
[07:49:20] <Krambiorix> data() ?
[07:50:15] <amph1bius|ghost> what are you caching
[07:50:20] <_jo_> Kramiorix: If it doesn't have to be visible to the DOM or it's complex data, data's the way to go.
[07:50:28] <_jo_> If it's something simple or the DOM has to see it, you can use attr.
[07:50:32] <Krambiorix> amph1bius|ghost, language translations for my labels
[07:51:09] <Aamir> Krambiorix: try using data-lang-LANGCODE="...." ?
[07:51:53] <Krambiorix> Aamir, thanks but i want to store all my translations
[07:52:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone familiar with Masonry?
[07:52:57] <amph1bius|ghost> what would masonry
[07:53:06] <amph1bius|ghost> people usually use isotope
[07:53:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and why is that the preference?
[07:54:17] <fesener_> _jo_, i think my problem is about draggable interface, seems like this line: http://dpaste.com/1310681/ , causes duplicate issues
[07:54:18] <Krambiorix> _jo_, with data() , is it cached in the browser?
[07:54:43] <amph1bius|ghost> ecky--ptang-zoob: more options
[07:54:53] <_jo_> Krambiorix: Oh.  No.  I don't think so.  Not across page loads, no.
[07:55:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm looking on the site, but there is no download link
[07:55:18] <Krambiorix> _jo_, is there something else to really cache it?
[07:55:35] <_jo_> Automatically?
[07:55:36] <systemfault> Krambiorix: If you need to keep data between page loads, you need something like localstorage.
[07:55:47] <_jo_> Krambiorix: systemfault is right.
[07:56:29] <_jo_> Krambiorix: If you're populating your page data by loading JS from a page and then attaching data with JS, there's not a good way to automatically serialize the exact page.
[07:56:35] <_jo_> At least, not that I know of.
[07:56:47] <_jo_> You'll have to manually save and load via localStorage or cookies.  (Bleh.)
[07:57:00] <mobile8> How can I force a mouseover on a path?
[07:57:06] <_jo_> If you're rendering out a complete page from your server, the rendered page will probably be cached.
[07:57:10] <mobile8> $("path").mouseover(); won't work
[07:57:22] <Krambiorix> _jo_, systemfault thanks!
[07:57:44] <GreekFreak> hi all
[07:58:59] <GreekFreak> I have event.preventDefault in the click event of an <a> element. I also have a checkbox within that <a> element. It seems that the preventDefault has propagated down to the checkbox. how do I stop that?
[08:00:10] <mobile8> Anyone?
[08:00:36] <c4ptnh00k> does anyone know if it is possible in jqgrid to save the search parameters so I can use them to build other queries
[08:00:46] <ph88> can i find out what is the height property of a class before it has been applied to a dom element ?
[08:01:51] <BSaboia> in the selector, how do i exclude multi-classes in the :not? for instance,  #btn_contact a:not(.exernal) excludes the class external, how can i exclude external OR another class?
[08:02:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I tried with isotope and the same problem in Chrome :-| the images overlap vertically, only the last row of images shows complete
[08:04:38] <shoky> mobile8: you can't trigger a real mouseover, you can only trigger a "mouseover" event that'll get handled by event handlers
[08:05:33] <mobile8> shoky: ok, but the event doesn't do what it supposed to do(on all other elements apart from <path> )
[08:05:46] <shoky> mobile8: what is it supposed to do?
[08:06:28] <mobile8> shoky: highlight (different fill colour)
[08:06:33] <shoky> mobile8: if there's a browser bug that doesn't handle the mouseover properly, there's not much you can do except find hacky workarounds maybe
[08:06:42] <mobile8> path:hover{fill: blue;opacity: .5;}
[08:06:52] <mobile8> That's all I want to force
[08:06:58] <mobile8> Of course I can do it using CSS
[08:06:58] <shoky> mobile8: you can't trigger a hover state from code afaik
[08:07:38] <mobile8> shoky: any idea how come .mouseover() event won't work on path but works on all other elements?
[08:07:43] <mobile8> (not just in 1 browser, but in any browser)
[08:07:53] <shoky> mobile8: it works..
[08:08:16] <mobile8> shoky: sec ill show an example
[08:09:50] <shoky> mobile8: http://jsfiddle.net/8r327/3/
[08:10:41] <fesener_> isnt this code: $('.radiant_box').html(''); supposed to remove everything in that <div> ? including every other div in it
[08:10:53] <mobile8> shoky: http://goo.gl/HgKRS
[08:10:55] <shoky> fesener_: yes
[08:11:03] <mobile8> shoky: hover over any of the "areas" that consist of multiple paths
[08:11:10] <fesener_> hmm
[08:11:20] <shoky> mobile8: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[08:11:22] <fesener_> problem must be something else then, thank you sk8ball
[08:11:26] <fesener_> shoky, *
[08:11:47] <mobile8> shoky: right
[08:12:14] <mobile8> shoky: what could be the issue
[08:12:27] <shoky> mobile8: you're triggering mouseover from a mouseover handler
[08:12:28] <mobile8> its in an endless loop
[08:12:33] <shoky> yes, don't do that ;P
[08:12:40] <mobile8> shoky: but see the $(this).removeClass("current"); part
[08:13:03] <mobile8> $(this).parent(".multiple-parts").children("path:not(.current)").trigger('mouseover');
[08:14:13] <shoky> mobile8: why do your paths also have multiple-parts class?
[08:14:43] <Krambiorix> _jo_, can you take a look? http://pastebin.com/mbp6T2wV
[08:15:15] <mobile8> shoky: removed, sorry
[08:15:21] <shoky> mobile8: jquery doesn't support all SVG stuff. including addClass/removeClass iirc
[08:15:43] <mobile8> shoky: ahh that explains a lot :)
[08:15:49] <mobile8> i thought so, but couldn't really find it
[08:16:19] <shoky> mobile8: http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/
[08:16:51] <Krambiorix> can someone take a look? http://pastebin.com/mbp6T2wV
[08:16:58] <mobile8> shoky: thanks!
[08:17:04] <mobile8> shoky: any reason why? I think svg is pretty cool?
[08:17:48] <shoky> mobile8: cause svg dom is different from html dom. and there are plugins that help with this. and: "We simply don't have the time to work on all the issues related to SVG/XML/VML documents, namespaced elements, and jQuery. "
[08:18:41] <mobile8> ok great
[08:18:49] <mobile8> any plugins i best use? raphael?
[08:19:21] <shoky> it's been a long time since i used one, donno which to recommend
[08:20:18] <mobile8> shoky: btw do you see any way to fixing the mouseover issue apart from using .css ?
[08:20:40] <shoky> the FF issue? i dunno
[08:20:58] <mobile8> not ff specific
[08:21:05] <mobile8> just simply highlighting other areas
[08:21:31] <mobile8> or triggering *any* type of hover
[08:21:50] <shoky> what's the issue?
[08:22:12] <mobile8> shoky: you see for example some areas consist of 2 to 3 parts, right?
[08:22:15] <mobile8> some districts
[08:22:35] <shoky> dont really know what's a district and what's a part
[08:22:40] <mobile8> shoky: hold on
[08:22:56] <Krambiorix> nevermind, solved it
[08:23:08] <mobile8> shoky: http://goo.gl/HgKRS
[08:23:20] <mobile8> See an area like Santa Cruz
[08:23:35] <mobile8> left from the dot and right from the dot separating it
[08:24:20] <shoky> why not make it one part? with the dots being over it
[08:25:38] <mobile8> shoky: how do you mean?
[08:25:44] <mobile8> shoky: as in the design?
[08:25:46] <mobile8> I can't
[08:25:53] <mobile8> shoky: and i have other issues
[08:25:56] <shoky> oks. well, what's the issue?
[08:26:27] <mobile8> shoky: hover over left part, also trigger hover right part
[08:26:29] <mobile8> that's all I need
[08:26:33] <shoky> you can add classes/styling to both parts on hover. except in FF :p
[08:26:34] <mobile8> (and also for the other districts)
[08:26:42] <mobile8> :(((((
[08:26:58] <shoky> sowwy :(
[08:27:17] <mobile8> pretty inefficient but i guess i change the css on mouseover and mouseleave ;(
[08:28:01] <shoky> well, add a class to the group, not the separate paths
[08:28:15] <mobile8> i didnt
[08:28:20] <mobile8> ohh the current stuff
[08:28:48] <shoky> just thought you meant it's inefficient cause you need to add to each path
[08:29:11] <mobile8> .attr() works btw
[08:29:13] <mobile8> for path's
[08:29:36] <shoky> yeah but that's not a nice interface for adding/removing classes
[08:30:31] <mobile8> shoky: $(this).parent(".multiple-parts").attr("class", "current"); $(this).parent(".multiple-parts").attr("class", "");
[08:30:34] <mobile8> whats wrong with this?
[08:30:54] <_jo_> Krambiorix: Checking it out.
[08:30:57] <_jo_> I think I know this issue.
[08:31:03] <shoky> mobile8: it wouldn't work if you had other classes there
[08:31:24] <shoky> mobile8: but uh can't you just :hover  the group?
[08:31:36] <mobile8> like how?
[08:31:39] <shoky> in css
[08:31:40] <shoky> i mean
[08:31:56] <shoky> g.multiple-parts:hover path { fill: blue }
[08:32:14] <_jo_> Krambiorix: I'm going to PM you out of channel.
[08:32:18] <_jo_> I think I know the solution.
[08:32:34] <mobile8> shoky: that would be a OMG
[08:32:41] <mobile8> sorry this works pretty good
[08:32:43] <mobile8> thanks
[08:32:47] <shoky> sweet
[08:33:31] <mobile8> shoky: btw, would you advise to add the text within the SVG's
[08:33:36] <mobile8> or just keep using the image
[08:34:12] <_jo_> Summary for anyone listening to the chain: Use alternative syntax $.data(document.body, 'translation', {blah blah blah})
[08:34:17] <shoky> i donno.. if you can make it look the same without images, i suppose that's better
[08:34:29] <mobile8> yea
[08:34:30] <mobile8> hmm
[08:34:54] <mobile8> shoky: btw the path will get double filled
[08:34:56] <mobile8> with blue
[08:35:05] <shoky> how so
[08:35:25] <mobile8> g.not(.multiple-parts:hover)
[08:35:29] <mobile8> is this possible?
[08:35:44] <mobile8> :not I mean
[08:35:53] <mobile8> shoky: because i have 2 hovers on path
[08:36:15] <shoky> i think that's possible yea.  dont undersant dhwat you mean
[08:37:05] <mobile8> shoky: hover over any of the parts
[08:37:12] <mobile8> shoky: the second part will get filled twice (so 100%)
[08:37:51] <shoky> mobile8: you didn't put opacity
[08:37:57] <shoky> oh
[08:38:19] <BillCriswell> I don't think I could want to work any less than I do right now.
[08:38:19] <mobile8> ah sorry
[08:38:24] <mobile8> but anyways
[08:39:09] <shoky> seems fine now
[08:39:15] <mobile8> yep
[08:40:09] <mobile8> shoky: one more thing, do you know if its possible to add a href, link to a <path> ?
[08:40:50] <shoky> a click handler would do it
[08:41:14] <shoky> no idea about <a>'s in svg ;p
[08:41:48] <shoky> anyways gotta go for a bit. cya
[08:42:14] <mobile8> shoky:  Attribute href not allowed on element path at this point.
[08:42:15] <mobile8> ahh cya
[08:44:21] <mobile8> data-href, how come this is not allowed on path
[08:47:52] <[E]sc> i'm using ajax formdata to upload a file dynamically via ajax on a form input box but when i click on the cancel, or re-opening the input box to change to another file, it will upload the number of times the upload was cancelled or changed.  i tried using new formData to reset to false however that doesn't work either;  Any suggestions on how to fix that?
[08:55:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experience with "isotope"?
[09:05:19] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I have a bit.
[09:05:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Have you experienced in chrome that the images overlap because the height of the box is not known before the images are all loaded?
[09:07:16] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You may have to call it when like $(window).load( init ); or put a height and width on the image itself.
[09:07:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but if you isotope it after all images are loaded, they first display all vertically and later shift upwards, which looks really crappy
[09:08:49] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You can put the dimensions on the images, or use progressive images
[09:09:04] <BillCriswell> if that isn't an option you can hide the isotop area till it's ready then display it.
[09:09:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what's progressive images?
[09:09:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I could use getImageSize() but i'm worried it will slow the load down a lot
[09:10:41] <BillCriswell> You know how an image typically loads from top to bottom? Progressives are blurry then focus in instead... I'm not positive that'll help but it's just a thought.
[09:10:52] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8622906/isotope-overlapping-images
[09:11:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah i saw that
[09:11:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it uses $(window).load
[09:11:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i'll try with the imagesize setting first
[09:11:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ty
[09:12:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Have you tried loading the images on the fly while scrolling down?
[09:12:21] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Can't say that I have.
[09:13:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell: it works with defining the sizes first
[09:13:38] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:14:17] <mobile8> Is there any type of way to add a href or data-href to a <path> ?
[09:14:26] <mobile8> or can I just use <path>http://www.google.com</path>
[09:14:38] <mobile8> (and handle it with js)
[09:16:34] <BillCriswell> mobile8: Not sure. I guess you can just do $('path').attr('data-href', href); ? Never really used jQuery for that ,though.
[09:17:21] <mobile8> BillCriswell: you mean to still have it valid? yea
[09:17:49] <BillCriswell> mobile8: No idea. Not even sure why I tried to answer that one.
[09:17:53] <shoky> mobile8: what's the problem with data-href?
[09:19:34] <mobile8> shoky: invalid for validator
[09:20:15] <gho5t> people still validate?
[09:20:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> even google.com is invalid :p
[09:20:30] <mobile8> gho5t: yea but probably client is going to be annoyed
[09:20:34] <mobile8> yea hehe
[09:20:44] <gho5t> eh
[09:20:59] <gho5t> we've done some big name sites and haven't had anyone bring up validating in years
[09:21:36] <mobile8> whatever, you are right
[09:21:40] <shoky> mobile8: what validator
[09:21:45] <mobile8> w3c
[09:21:52] <mobile8> doesn't allowed data-href on <path>
[09:21:58] <shoky> seems fine to me
[09:21:59] <mobile8> allow*
[09:22:00] <BillCriswell> Isn't the HTML5 validator still in beta anyway?
[09:22:22] <BillCriswell> Ah, "experimental".
[09:22:44] <gho5t> hehe sounds pretty beta
[09:22:57] <BillCriswell> I want to start coding sites in XHTML-Print 1.0.
[09:23:01] <mobile8> http://goo.gl/HgKRS
[09:23:04] <mobile8> validate this :)
[09:23:16] <mobile8> Line 107, Column 2449: Attribute data-href not allowed on element path at this point.
[09:23:19] <mobile8> :(
[09:23:28] <mobile8> "at this point"
[09:23:54] <gho5t> seems even sillier to validate your svg
[09:24:22] <mobile8> why not
[09:24:34] <mobile8> svg can perfectly be valid
[09:24:41] <mobile8> although its not html
[09:24:58] <mobile8> sorry have to do some food shopping :( ttyl
[09:25:12] <BillCriswell> Smores Pop-Tarts, please.
[09:25:33] <gho5t> test it in your target browsers
[09:25:38] <gho5t> it either works or it doesn't
[09:25:53] <gho5t> although I suppose validating does make it more "future-proof"
[09:26:17] <gho5t> maybe I'm just being lazy
[09:26:40] <BillCriswell> I validate the structure of things, but I'm not sure I'd worry about that error in particular
[09:26:58] <gho5t> yeah I guess when you think in terms of $
[09:27:19] <gho5t> does it make sense to spend a good chunk of time fixing something esoteric like that
[09:28:42] <BillCriswell> gho5t: I don't work with SVG enough to know the concerns
[09:29:08] <gho5t> from my experience it's a tempermental bitch
[09:29:16] <BillCriswell> Haha, then i'd be careful
[09:29:19] <gho5t> so if  you can get it to work in your target browsers, be happy and move on
[09:30:35] <rosieres> shoky: can I PN you ?
[09:43:52] <rosieres> who had probs with links in SVG ?
[09:50:13] <maxmoore14> can someone help me understand deferred objects? I have the following code: http://jsbin.com/afovij/1/edit
[09:50:42] <maxmoore14> it runs 1 time through instead of the length of the queue
[09:51:34] <maxmoore14> I would think that resetting the deferred var to a new $.Deferred() would allow me to call resolve() again
[09:51:43] <maxmoore14> clearly not
[09:53:03] <fesener_> would someone tell me why "window.location.href("/nodetest/");" gives out "Uncaught TypeError: Property 'href' of object [object Location] is not a function " error
[09:53:12] <fesener_> isnt this the way to redirect user to another ur
[09:53:14] <fesener_> url*
[09:53:47] <NoiseEee> don't you use ...href =   not ...href()
[09:55:19] <fesener_> thank you NoiseEee i've used window.location.replace("/nodetest/"); instead now it works
[09:55:45] <fesener_> .replace(url) and .href = "url" is the same thing i suppose
[09:57:39] <NoiseEee> iirc they have different effects on location history
[10:00:31] <epicowl> anyone familiar with chosen? I need to change the behavior for how selected options are shown in the drop down from being greyed out to being removed from the available options list… not sure how to approach that
[10:18:15] <Unode> -quit
[10:29:13] <CWSpear> nice...
[10:29:16] <CWSpear> mt
[10:38:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can anyone explain where the hell this extra data comes from when you scroll to the bottom of the page? http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/infinite-scroll.html - there is no php script anywhere and no json or xml loaded!?
[10:39:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in the html, the last element is CA - and then it adds stuff on the fly without a data file or ajax call somehow
[10:40:33] <Brutick> Hey all, I'm stuck on something that I feel should be easy, but I'm not sure how to get it done. Basically, I have an autocomplete with a datasource of some nicely formatted JSON data. Assume this in on a form which can be submitted to the server and post into the URL. In the URL, only the raw number ID of the selection chosen is kept, and not the label from the autocomplete. Is it possible that I could restore this label somehow f
[10:42:11] <Brutick> JSON is formatted as follows { "value":"Test1", "label":"Test1", "id":137 },{ "value":"Test2", "label":"Test2", "id":120 }
[10:48:35] <BillCriswell> Brutick: I'm having a hard time following. Explain differently?
[10:48:59] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Yeah it's a little awkward to explain.
[10:51:09] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Let me try this differently. So I have an autocomplete with a JSON datasource with the following format: { { "value":"Test1", "label":"Test1", "id":137 },{ "value":"Test2", "label":"Test2", "id":120 } }. This autocomplete is on a form. A user can choose something from the autocomplete no problem, but my issue is that I want to restore the autocomplete's selection after the page has redirected with the selections ID.
[10:51:22] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: It uses the #pages a to find the next page.
[10:51:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[10:52:10] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Open up the console and click "Network"
[10:52:12] <Brutick> BillCriswell: I can restore the ID, but I would like to restore the label associated to that ID. For example, if the user selects "Test2", I can only set the autocompletes value to 120
[10:52:23] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You'll see 2.htm, 3.html, 4.html etc
[10:52:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so it uses static pages?!
[10:52:32] <Brutick> BillCriswell: but that doesn't update the label, they don't match
[10:52:40] <BillCriswell> Yes, it loads 2.html then finds .element elements
[10:52:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need it loaded with ajax in a php script
[10:52:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you think that's possible?
[10:52:59] <BillCriswell> Absolutely. Took a look at infinite scroll.
[10:53:08] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: This IS using Ajax.
[10:53:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> this is using infinitescroll
[10:53:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the plugin
[10:53:31] <BillCriswell> Correct, but look at the documentation for that on how it works in particular.
[10:53:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I did, but no examples with PHP
[10:55:16] <BillCriswell> Brutick: So you want to grab from that JSON where id === a certain number?
[10:56:30] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Yes, match the ID with it's label, and then set the autocomplete accordingly.
[11:02:07] <BillCriswell> Brutick: so like.. var value; $.each( data, function( idx, item ){ if( item.id === 24 ){ var value = item.value; } }); $('.autocomplete').val( item.value ).trigger('change'); ?
[11:05:40] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Let me try this out, hold on
[11:05:47] <RandalSchwartz> using jquery ui tabs, now with on-demand loading.  custy wants to be able to bookmark different activated tabs, and return to that bookmark.  presume this is  a solved problem, but the top google hits are to jquery BBQ, which seems a bit neglected.
[11:06:45] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: All you'd do is call a $.get() for the new items that returns a JSON object, ( or even just the rendered html ) and calling $container.isotope('insert', HTML);
[11:07:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm not sure where to place that $.get()
[11:07:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> function( newElements ) {
[11:07:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob>           $container.isotope( 'appended', $( newElements ) );
[11:07:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob>         }
[11:08:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What do I need to adapt there to make a get call? I don't understand this code structure
[11:08:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> where does newElements come from?
[11:09:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, I get where it comes from, 2.html, 3.html, ...
[11:09:40] <BillCriswell> it's the result of the call to 2.html and 4.html after jquery selects all the .element elements
[11:10:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, but how can I possibly do a $.get here?
[11:10:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have the php script ready
[11:10:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it outputs the html
[11:10:48] <BillCriswell> do you pass it a page number and it outputs what you need?
[11:10:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[11:11:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it calculates the next x items and echos them
[11:13:09] <seigmann> I am trying to learn Jquery but i dont get this to work. http://pastebin.com/dV8rTzWe Do i got any obvious errors ?
[11:13:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> seigmann: you need to give the button an ID
[11:13:52] <BillCriswell> seigmann: You want $('form').on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[11:14:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <input type='submit' value='submit' id='submit' />
[11:14:35] <seigmann> Thanks! :)
[11:14:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and preventdefault like bill says
[11:14:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> otherwise it will reload the page
[11:15:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> click() works too, but .on is better
[11:16:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell: can you help me out a bit with that php call
[11:16:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[11:17:59] <Brutick> BillCriswell: You know what? I couldn't get it to work, but I think instead I will just keep track of the label and restore it from the URL if needed. It ends up being easier to understand in the end when someone looks at this code.
[11:19:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell: http://www.jquery4u.com/tutorials/jquery-infinite-scrolling-demos/ - this guy writes: "it cant handle dynamic generated content such as hitting the same page.php file with appended parameters" - is he wrong then?
[11:21:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> should I just do a get before anything from infinitescroll and call it arrayOfNewElemes ?
[11:30:40] <BillCriswell> Ok, not sure infinite scroll would be able to call the $.get, but can you just do like items.php?page=1|2|3|4 ?
[11:31:19] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: ^
[11:31:31] <BillCriswell> Well, easily
[11:37:21] <YammYcoding> anyone knows any tool to record a jquery animation and save to swf or gif ?
[11:47:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <BillCriswell>: but how does that plugin know what the next pages are? In the code, it only shows:
[11:47:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <nav id="page-nav">
[11:47:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob>   <a href="pages/2.html"></a>
[11:47:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> </nav>
[11:47:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and yet, it loads 3.html
[11:48:06] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: It's increments that number automatically
[11:48:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so how would that work with a php GET param then?
[11:48:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> load.php?p=3
[11:49:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't see where it increments that value
[11:49:34] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Try it and see.
[11:50:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in that format i just posted?
[11:50:20] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/blob/master/jquery.infinitescroll.js#L250
[11:51:05] <BillCriswell> Yes, copy the HTML in the example exactly and replace the link to their second page with load.php?p=2
[11:51:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> alright
[11:51:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hold on
[11:59:06] <RandalSchwartz> I have a number of docready functions that apply extra navigation.  I'm now ajax-loading some ui tabs, and of course, doc is ready before those tabs load.  is there an elegant solution to be sure that the docready functions apply only to the loaded panel, and not to the full document again.
[11:59:25] <RandalSchwartz> I fear that some of the docready things are not idempotent
[11:59:33] <RandalSchwartz> (although I didn't write it so I don't know)
[12:03:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <BillCriswell>: works like a charm!
[12:03:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx a lot
[12:03:29] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Welcome.
[12:08:24] <BANNERLOOKER> This might be a dumb question, but the jQuery conference in Austin, does the ticket price include accommodations? I saw the site says they blocked off some parts of the Hyatt etc, if it doesn't include that how do we get in those blocks?
[12:10:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's just very very slow
[12:10:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I just do a ton of echo in that php script, could that be the reason?
[12:24:38] <jabagawee_> why is this giving me four instead of three
[12:24:39] <jabagawee_> http://jsfiddle.net/PR46A/
[12:25:53] <RandalSchwartz> looks like 4 elements to me. :)
[12:26:58] <jabagawee_> isn't the map operating over a selection of three <ul> elements?
[12:29:37] <amph1bius|ghost> looks like ul.children, which contains 2 1 1 , no ?
[12:30:39] <jabagawee_> i figured since i was mapping on $("ul"), which has three matches, i would get three elements back?
[12:34:05] <zfmf1> he guys i can't set a value to a attribute on receive event by jquery sortable anyone an idea why not??
[12:34:33] <seigmann> im trying to do some ajax tutorials but i dont seem to get any of them to work
[12:34:45] <seigmann> is there anything major thats been happening since last year ?
[12:35:26] <BillCriswell> jabagawee_: It's returnng 4 empty objects.
[12:35:47] <jabagawee_> BillCriswell: why not three? i'm mapping on <ul> elements, not <li>
[12:38:33] <BillCriswell> jabagawee_: You're retuning an array... which is weird
[12:39:03] <BillCriswell> jabagawee_: http://jsfiddle.net/PR46A/1/ is this what you want?
[12:40:43] <seigmann> http://pastebin.com/SCs5vMN3 i would be ever grateful if you could tell me why the ** this wont work : )
[12:41:18] <jabagawee_> BillCriswell: my full code doesn't return empty objects
[12:41:48] <jabagawee_> it's going to be returning an Array of Array of Objects, where the outermost array is the container, each inner array represents a <ul>, and each object represents a <li>
[12:43:04] <BillCriswell> Ah
[12:43:54] <monk3y> seigmann: wanna throw in a .fail() function just to see if anything's going wrong there?
[12:43:56] <jabagawee_> the main question is, why does .map() automatically decide to flatten everything?
[12:43:58] <monk3y> seigmann: as per http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[12:44:36] <systemfault> seigmann: Could be crossdomain issues
[12:44:40] <BillCriswell> jabagawee_: http://jsfiddle.net/PR46A/2/
[12:45:11] <RandalSchwartz> can I trigger $(document).trigger('ready') to re-run all docready functions?
[12:45:16] <RandalSchwartz> doesn't seem to work
[12:46:06] <monk3y> RandalSchwartz: if you know you might need to re-run them, why not wrap them in a function that calls all of them, then run that at $(document).ready(), then again if/when you need them.
[12:46:30] <RandalSchwartz> Yeah - I'm heading towards that.
[12:46:34] <BillCriswell> jabagawee_: Have to double bag it.
[12:46:38] <BillCriswell> double wrap it*
[12:46:41] <monk3y> But I concede if there is an event you can trigger for ready().
[12:46:56] <dannydagger> hey guys.. whats the difference between jQuery 1 and 2? I just noticed html5 boilerplate uses jQuery 1 stock.. is it better?
[12:47:12] <amph1bius|ghost> jquery 2 drops support for ie7 and 8 i believe
[12:47:37] <systemfault> dannydagger: Like amph1bius|ghost said.
[12:47:46] <dannydagger> ah ok thanks
[12:47:52] <systemfault> dannydagger: In the real world, IE8 still needs to be supporter.
[12:47:52] <blindMoe> I believe there is still the compatibility addon though is there not?
[12:47:56] <systemfault> *supported
[12:48:08] <blindMoe> maybe that is just for 1.10+
[12:48:17] <systemfault> blindMoe: No, the whole point of jQuery 2.0 is to remove support for old browsers.
[12:48:50] <systemfault> I don't personally think that jQuery 2.0 will be usable before at least 5 years.
[12:49:00] <systemfault> I definitely hope I'm wrong.
[12:49:07] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: 1.10 supports IE7 and IE8, 2+ doesn't.
[12:49:13] <seigmann> monk3y nothing happens
[12:51:14] <BillCriswell> What a butthole. It took me like 5 seconds to google that answer.
[12:52:32] <dannydagger> me?
[12:53:12] <seigmann> no u!
[12:53:24] <BillCriswell> Haha no.
[12:53:34] <BillCriswell> jabagawee_.
[12:53:50] <dannydagger> hehe ok
[13:00:25] <jabagawee> BillCriswell: oh wow thanks
[13:00:29] <jabagawee> any clue why it does that though?
[13:00:34] <BillCriswell> Ah, there it is!
[13:01:33] <BillCriswell> jabagawee: Umm... I want to say map has to return a bunch of the same things?
[13:02:44] <BillCriswell> Most of the time I just get lucky with google though.
[13:03:01] <mobile8> is it semantically bad to add a data-href to a <path> ?
[13:03:09] <BillCriswell> That doesn't appear to be it.
[13:03:39] <mobile8> BillCriswell: whats the issue then
[13:04:03] <BillCriswell> mobile8: Was speaking to jabagawee. Sory about that.
[13:04:36] <jabagawee> heh
[13:04:37] <BillCriswell> Oh duh I'm trying with javascripts .map.
[13:05:20] <mobile8> BillCriswell: oh np
[13:05:33] <jabagawee> jquery devs seem unwilling to fix it
[13:05:46] <jabagawee> and acknowledge the array wrapping the retval is the correct workaround
[13:05:46] <jabagawee> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10541
[13:07:10] <mobile8> Does anyone know this? Adding data-href to a <path> is this semantically incorrect?
[13:08:35] <shoky> mobile8: what do you mean by "semantically incorrect"?
[13:08:38] <BillCriswell> jabagawee: Interesting.
[13:09:15] <mobile8> shoky: not intended
[13:09:27] <jabagawee> also this was very dumb of me to miss, but the docs themselves note this behavior: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[13:10:02] <shoky> mobile8: according to the svg spec it's invalid.  to me it still seems semantically correct. tho maybe i'm not parsing that phrase correctly
[13:11:58] <BillCriswell> jabagawee: Ah, interesting.
[13:12:09] <BillCriswell> I never ran across that behavoir.
[13:12:12] <BillCriswell> Think I'm just lucky.
[13:16:37] <ExceptionlCatch> hello mighty jquery people. i am having a difficult time wiring a form submit button to execute a function on the submit action
[13:17:12] <ExceptionlCatch> the function only contains an alert statement, nothing happens, and i followed the api reference on the jquery website
[13:17:25] <systemfault> ExceptionlCatch: Already, you got a problem… you never wire the submit button but the submit event of the form.
[13:17:34] <systemfault> ExceptionlCatch: Do you have a code we can look at?
[13:17:47] <ExceptionlCatch> systemfault: where should i paste?
[13:17:53] <Ungy> if I wanted to bind an event using the on function to a change event if an input select or text area field has the attribute data-validators what would the statement look like? something like this? $("body").on("change", "[data-validators]", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[13:17:56] <systemfault> jsfiddle.net or another paste website

[13:31:44] <shoky> guess i'm too used to my native language, though i'm practically a native english speaker too
[13:31:45] <Itrace> Could anybody help me with this Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/thjW2/4/ How can I add starting zeros to my number counter. I've got all the logic there to do what I need. I just don't know how to modify my function so that it adds zeros to the beginning of a number.
[13:32:00] <systemfault> shoky: What is the meaning your native language?
[13:32:49] <shoky> no meaning.  my nick is usually antishok  which comes from antishock.   adding i or y at the end of words in hebrew is usually intended to make it sound.. cute/cuddly.
[13:33:00] <shoky> so it sounds very natural to me

[14:14:33] <gho5t> gh0st: you can't do that with jquery alone
[14:14:42] <gho5t> you would use jquery for the ajax part

[16:14:01] <nevins> hi all. I have a question about jQuery 1.10.1.  Why is it that XMLHttpRequest.send is called @line 8706 yet the callbacks are setup after issuing the send call. I would have expected the callbacks to be setup prior to the send call? Can anyone tell me why it was done this way or am I not seeing it right?
[16:16:18] <Dinho> why not work http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/kB69U/  help me please?
[16:21:20] <nevins> Dinho, php is processed server-side.
[16:30:08] <shoky> nevins: it's a bit odd but i suppose it doesn't matter due to javascript's single-threaded nature. and the XHR page on MDN says this about xhr.onreadystatechange - "The callback is called from the user interface thread.". though likely there's a better explanation
[16:31:02] <shoky> so it can't be called until the current js execution relinquishes its "lock"
[16:32:02] <shoky> oh he's gone ;s
[16:39:38] <mobile8> .click event won't work on touch devices, any good substitute?
[16:40:05] <waysc> .on('touchstart')
[16:40:54] <waysc> touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel
[16:41:20] <mobile8> thanks
[16:41:28] <mobile8> so can just use touchstart?
[16:41:49] <waysc> yep
[16:52:14] <mobile8> touchstart doesn't work
[16:52:15] <Soltis> It looks like position() is broken. I have a select box halfway down the page; I do $('#mysel').children('option').first().position().top and it returns the absolute offset, just the same as .offset()
[16:52:16] <mobile8> on ipad
[16:53:57] <waysc> mobile8: I haven't done a ton of work with touchstart, you'll have to do some research mate
[17:03:23] <ernston> hi, can anyone help with a jquery issue i have the code on jsfiddle
[17:06:04] <alexr2> post the link ernston
[17:06:53] <shoky> Soltis: position/offset don't seem to be working at all for <option>s. what do you wanna get exactly
[17:09:10] <ernston> here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/CTCmy/1/
[17:09:17] <Soltis> shoky: I want to scroll a <select multiple> so that a specific option is at the top of the list.
[17:09:34] <ernston> if you select a checkbox it shows and hides items
[17:09:45] <Soltis> shoky: I already thought of a more perverse hack (selectedIndex to the end of the list, then selectedIndex to the item I want) but that's just bad and wrong.
[17:09:48] <ernston> but if you select 2 checkbox's its the same as   OR, and not AND
[17:09:52] <ernston> if that makes sense
[17:10:33] <alexr2> what checkbox?
[17:10:51] <ernston> the horizontal
[17:11:10] <ernston> spacecake, ....
[17:11:23] <ernston> if you select spacecake , 2 should show
[17:11:27] <alexr2> ahh i see
[17:11:31] <ernston> select cat and, and it shows 1
[17:11:36] <ernston> but together they show 2
[17:11:47] <ernston> try spacecake and cat on there own
[17:12:15] <alexr2> okay, so what isn't working?
[17:12:43] <ernston> spacecake shows 2
[17:12:46] <ernston> cat shows 1
[17:12:48] <ernston> so if you select both
[17:12:52] <ernston> how many should show ?
[17:12:56] <ernston> 1
[17:13:03] <ernston> it shows 2 :(
[17:13:28] <ernston> it should be the equivilant to spacecake AND cat
[17:15:44] <alexr2> ahh, so what you are getting is an OR statement, and you want an AND statement
[17:16:32] <ernston> the jquery is the issue
[17:16:39] <ernston> it selects anything it matches
[17:16:43] <ernston> it does not match both cases
[17:16:55] <alexr2> right
[17:17:05] <ernston> not sure how i do this with jquery
[17:18:15] <sahbeewah> Soltis, you can't do that, and that sounds bad and wrong anyway
[17:18:27] <sahbeewah> in fact, multiple on select is kind of bad in the first place
[17:19:06] <sahbeewah> should probably consider using checkboxes
[17:20:11] <alexr2> ernston, gimme a minute to think
[17:21:21] <Soltis> sawrubh: I certainly *can* do that. I've tested it. The problem is that it's certainly not optimal. However, if jQuery is broken, then I'm already out of Kansas anyway.
[17:22:04] <ernston> no probs
[17:22:13] <ernston> trying to get my head around it too
[17:23:31] <mobile8> whats the best way to set the r attribute for a circle in css?
[17:23:37] <shoky> it's not jquery, it's chrome
[17:23:41] <shoky> Soltis ^
[17:24:09] <Soltis> shoky: I'm using Firefox
[17:24:55] <Soltis> And my approach _WORKS_.
[17:25:06] <Soltis> If you have another *working* approach, do tell.
[17:27:19] <Soltis> var mysel = $('#mysel'); mysel.prop('selectedIndex', mysel.children('option').last().index()); mysel.children('option').each(function(idx) { if(sometest) { mysel.prop('selectedIndex', idx) }); #This works because selectedIndex minimally scrolls to the index specified. Does your aproach work at all?
[17:27:52] <shoky> Soltis: .offset() works fine in FF
[17:28:14] <Soltis> shoky: Yes, offset() works perfectly. position() does NOT.
[17:28:40] <shoky> Soltis: you don't need position(), you need offset()
[17:28:45] <shoky> in FF, at least
[17:29:15] <shoky> oops
[17:29:31] <Soltis> shoky: No I don't. Offset works relative to the document. Position works relative to the parent element. I've tested; offset() works according to spec and offset().top is the correct value of 305; position().top ALSO returns 305 which is WRONG WRONG WRONG.
[17:29:33] <shoky> i keep mixing them up, sorry
[17:30:02] <shoky> but, the first thing i found googling was using offset() which works on FF
[17:30:18] <Soltis> RTFM: "The .position() method allows us to retrieve the current position of an element relative to the offset parent."

[17:40:36] <Soltis> shoky: Interesting. Does not WFM
[17:40:47] <shoky> at all? or what
[17:41:28] <Soltis> shoky: It scrolls to the wrong offset.
[17:41:41] <alexr2> Dinho, it's not valid to have more than one element on the page with the same id.  Second, you moved the add button out of the ol.  Your click event binding selector isn't valid anymore
[17:41:52] <alexr2> Either move the button back into the ol, or update your selector for the binding event
[17:42:07] <shoky> Soltis: by a few pixels or by a whole option?
[17:42:18] <shoky> does the text get cut off
[17:42:26] <Soltis> shoky: By the distance of the element from the document.
[17:42:51] <Dinho> ok I'll do the tests
[17:42:53] <shoky> seems fine here
[17:44:17] <Dinho> attention is fuck!

[17:45:15] <alexr2> You're welcome
[17:47:42] <Dinho> more I would like to add the button to stay beneath it all, because as I will put this button down while you're inside the ol?
[17:48:16] <alexr2> It's fine to have it outside of the ol, you just need to update your selector
[17:48:25] <Dinho> sorry my English with the help of translator is lame!
[17:49:43] <shoky> Soltis: position() is also working fine for me on FF
[17:50:08] <shoky> Soltis: position() is supposed to get the offset from the _offset_ parent, not from the parent
[17:50:23] <Dinho> but is there any possibility of clocar button always below all fields? <alexr2>
[17:50:56] <Dinho> but is there any possibility to put the button always below all fields?

[20:26:45] <Davey> this is the HTML through firebug: <input type="checkbox"value="complete" name="tasks[3][status]" checked="checked">
[20:27:25] <solancer>  hey guys how can I use select2 with date validation?
[20:27:33] <solancer> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[20:27:46] <solancer> http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/jslibs/validmonth.js
[20:27:57] <Davey> it is picking this one up: <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" value="complete" name="tasks[2][status]"> — the only real different I see is the order of the args
[20:29:10] <solancer> anyone?
[21:24:46] <darkpassenger> If I want to bind event to dynamically loaded element, i would use .on() , but if I just want to refer to them (as in $('.dynamically_loaded').find..._
[21:24:59] <darkpassenger> what would I be better to use
[21:27:25] <systemfault>  There's only .on now to bind events.
[21:27:51] <systemfault> .on has two syntaxes.. one of them works with dynamically loaded elements
[21:28:31] <darkpassenger> what is it ?!
[21:28:35] <darkpassenger> lol
[21:28:39] <darkpassenger> im desperate
[21:28:41] <darkpassenger> to know
[22:44:28] <gehrc> Hey everyone. Is there a jQuery function that would fire an event if a form item was changed indirectly, or directly?
[22:44:49] <gehrc> For example, I have a 'select' box whose options depend on the value in the box above it.
[22:45:16] <gehrc> If I chain them and do three, changing the first box will affect the second, but not the third.
[22:54:15] <gehrc> I'm trying a nextAll and that doesn't seem to help...
[23:01:46] <matchs> Hello gehrc. It's my first time on this channel, so idk if you are going to get a better answer, but I can tell you the way I like to do this kind of things. Actually, I like to work with custom events in such cases like the one you described.
[23:02:12] <gehrc> matchs: I just appreciate any help! :D
[23:04:42] <matchs> You can add an event to the the selects and then trigger it passing the sequence of the select that was changed (1, 2 or 3) when something changes... a common parent element to the three selects would "listen" to this event and call a function that could load the content on the next 'select' boxes.
[23:07:11] <gehrc> Hmm... interesting...
[23:07:53] <matchs> If you can wait for a while I can prepare a fiddle with an example
[23:08:45] <gehrc> Sure! I'm going to try playing with it myself though haha so I'll let you know if I get it until then.
[23:09:12] <matchs> Ok
[23:28:32] <matchs> gehrc... Here is the Fiddle, may not be the best solution but I hope this can help you to have some ideas. http://jsfiddle.net/BapN5/
[23:29:42] <gehrc> Hmm yeah that doesn't seem to work, but I'll play with it a bit. Thank you!
[23:30:18] <matchs> really? It worked here...
[23:30:27] <matchs> Change the first select from A to B
[23:30:39] <matchs> let me see if I made some mistake
[23:31:13] <gehrc> Yeah, it changes the second one, just not the third, which is the one giving me problems :)
[23:31:55] <matchs> You want to change both of at the same time?
[23:33:03] <gehrc> Yeah. So if the topmost select changes, I don't want my users to be able to select something in the last dropdown that isn't valid for the combination
[23:33:21] <gehrc> So if I do B, W, H
[23:33:55] <gehrc> And change B to A, I get A, X, H, but H isn't a valid value for W
[23:35:12] <matchs> Got it... we can make small simple changes like disable the unused selects
[23:40:01] <matchs> I made a little modification to make it work as you described. It can be improved to a more general solution, but please, see if it's what you need: http://jsfiddle.net/BapN5/2/
[23:40:46] <gehrc> Ah yeah that's perfect! Thanks so much for your help!!
[23:41:19] <matchs> You're welcome
[23:44:44] <cassel> how do I calculate the amount of 2 imput with jquery and put on the 3rd one?
[23:46:32] <cassel> http://jsfiddle.net/Pe3MF/1/
[23:46:59] <matchs> É Br cassel?
[23:47:11] <cassel> yap
[23:48:03] <luvmyh0nda> is it possible to createobjecturl from the success of ajax() ?
[23:48:24] <luvmyh0nda> & then post said objecturl
[23:48:26] <ravenzz> what is createobjecturl
[23:48:26] <ravenzz> ?
[23:48:37] <luvmyh0nda> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.URL.createObjectURL
[23:50:29] <luvmyh0nda> eg: http://jsfiddle.net/4wGQ3/
[23:52:57] <ravenzz> oh nice I didn't know about that
[23:53:05] <luvmyh0nda> lol, it would be cool if it worked
[23:53:32] <ravenzz> I think you can't do this : 'image='+window.URL.createObjectURL(data)+'&type=full&imgname=RAD7C6BF.1..0.0.1.JPG',
[23:54:05] <ravenzz> Creates a new object URL, whose lifetime is tied to the document in the window on which it was created.
[23:54:35] <luvmyh0nda> it throws: SCRIPT16386: No such interface supported
[23:55:10] <luvmyh0nda> perhaps if i send data as an object?
[23:58:28] <ravenzz> man even though you could get the URL, it won't work next time you open the page
[23:58:36] <luvmyh0nda> well
[23:58:53] <luvmyh0nda> wait, what?
[23:59:21] <ravenzz> I mean why do you need to send the object url to the server?
[23:59:41] <luvmyh0nda> window.URL.createObjectURL(data) works kinda like php's base64_encode (i believe)
[23:59:46] <matchs> I got curious about that too
[23:59:51] <luvmyh0nda> encodes the image so that it can be sent without losing integrity
