[00:23:27] <jak2000> why not execute: $('#selVacEmpRef').trigger("change");   ?
[00:23:37] <jak2000> how to manually execute this event:
[00:23:46] <jak2000> $('#selVacEmpRef, #selEntSal').on('change', function () {
[00:25:18] <Uhkis> make it a normal function and call it?
[00:25:57] <jak2000> mmm i think in this....
[00:26:02] <jak2000> is the unique solution?
[00:27:57] <jak2000> ok
[01:04:19] <jak2000> Uhkis worked with google maps?
[01:44:35] <jak2000> hi
[01:44:39] <jak2000> anyone alive?
[02:13:26] <Cork> jak2000: if you have a question just ask it, don't force ppl to ask for the question
[02:15:14] <jak2000> :)
[02:16:00] <jak2000> how to stop a function, i try return false; but continue..... why?
[02:16:05] <jak2000> exist other way?
[02:17:09] <jak2000> cork any advice?
[02:17:30] <Cork> jak2000: jsfiddle?
[02:17:39] <jak2000> arghh much code
[02:17:43] <jak2000> can i paste on pastebin?
[02:17:56] <Cork> preferably not
[02:18:02] <Cork> i didn't require a working jsfiddle
[02:18:16] <jak2000> ok
[02:18:17] <Cork> it just has tools to make reading it easier
[02:18:50] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/urz7qafb/3/
[02:19:03] <jak2000> check please line 34
[02:19:30] <jak2000> call function on line: 1473  right?
[02:19:38] <Cork> jak2000: you return in a callback to ajax
[02:19:45] <Cork> it won't ever do what you want
[02:19:50] <jak2000> yes
[02:20:06] <jak2000> i wan tstop on line 35
[02:20:09] <jak2000> how to?
[02:20:09] <Cork> also i would very VERY V-E-R-Y strongly recommend against async: false
[02:20:24] <jak2000> yes i know
[02:21:04] <Cork> jak2000: put what you have after the .done callback inside it
[02:21:20] <Cork> alternatively use an .always()
[02:21:36] <jak2000> replace .done to .always ?
[02:21:58] <Cork> basically remove done and fail and do it all in .always
[02:22:10] <Cork> then move the code you have after the $.ajax call into .always too
[02:22:19] <Cork> then you could do about what you're trying to do
[02:22:54] <Cork> but really... why are you using sync ajax?
[02:23:00] <Cork> i don't see a single reason for it here
[02:23:20] <Cork> only effect is that you will make browser ui's hang
[02:23:35] <jak2000> this ajax sync is for check if records was added without saving...
[02:23:55] <Cork> uh?
[02:24:01] <jak2000> yes
[02:24:09] <Cork> and why isn't that check in the server code when you load?
[02:24:44] <jak2000> i capture records and save with status -100 when user click on SAVE button this status was changed to 1
[02:25:07] <Cork> ya, so you move integrity validation from the server into the browser javascript
[02:25:13] <Cork> that is a terrible idea
[02:25:57] <Cork> the client can do the work but the server needs to be the one policing the actions
[02:27:18] <Cork> and if you do that you won't need this sync calls
[02:27:25] <jak2000> how to?
[02:27:38] <jak2000> i solve the problem if the load stop on line 35 :)
[02:28:01] <Cork> ya, and nothing prevents the user from disabling the js lines or modifying them and then what do you have?
[02:28:15] <Cork> that is why the server needs to do this
[02:29:05] <jak2000> ok
[02:29:36] <Cork> so what you can do is have the fields disabled on page load if you want the data to come from ajax
[02:29:57] <Cork> and then make an async ajax call that fetches the state for the controls set the new state and enable them
[02:30:03] <Cork> then you don't need to freeze things
[02:30:18] <Cork> a better option is to have the page have that data as you load the page
[02:30:28] <jak2000> ahhh ya interesting
[02:30:57] <Cork> sync ajax is never needed
[02:31:22] <jak2000> ok
[02:34:32] <jak2000> solved
[02:34:34] <jak2000> ;)
[02:38:46] <jak2000> much thanks
[02:39:02] <Cork> np
[02:44:50] <jak2000> sleeping
[02:57:02] <anli> How do I simulate a button press? .click() seemed to not work
[02:57:26] <anli> No error output
[02:57:50] <Cork> anli: is the "button" a <button> or just a link styled as a button?
[02:58:07] <anli> the first
[02:58:18] <Cork> then make sure the selector matches the button
[02:58:22] <anli> did
[02:58:23] <Cork> cause that works
[02:58:26] <anli> oh, must check then
[02:58:51] <anli> oh, its input[type=submit], lol
[02:59:05] <Cork> :submit might be a nicer option
[02:59:23] <anli> And the click was directed to the parent span, it appears
[02:59:28] <anli> two errors
[02:59:39] <anli> yeah, I like those shortcuts
[03:00:05] <Cork> ya, but not only that it also matches <button>
[03:00:27] <anli> $("#theid>input").click() was it
[03:01:09] <anli> Does :submit match button as well, you say?
[03:01:18] <anli> They are kinda the same thing in some strange way...
[03:01:28] <anli> Nobody knows which
[03:01:33] <Cork> they are exactly the same thing
[03:01:39] <anli> Spelled differently
[03:01:54] <Cork> <button>Submit</button> === <input type="submit">
[03:02:08] <Cork> with the difference that input type="submit" SUCKS to style
[03:02:20] <anli> Then they are not equivalent
[03:02:44] <anli> Or they would both suck to style
[03:02:45] <Cork> they are equivalent in terms of functionality
[03:03:02] <anli> Style is the new functionality
[03:03:03] <Cork> meaning they both submit the form
[03:03:05] <anli> yeah
[03:03:38] <anli> But they cant be selectored in the same way?
[03:03:45] <anli> new word
[03:03:59] <Cork> well if you select input you won't select button tags no
[03:04:13] <Cork> that is kinda obvious
[03:04:28] <anli> Not obvious if we just declared them equivalent
[03:04:37] <Cork> uh, yes it is
[03:04:46] <Cork> cause css selects on tag name
[03:05:06] <Cork> and as the tag name differs of course you can't use the same tag NAME selector...
[03:05:37] <Cork> it would be as expecting $('body') to select <form>s
[03:09:11] <anli> So body and form are not equivalent
[03:09:14] <anli> lol
[03:09:22] <anli> Lets leave that discussion, can we :)
[03:09:42] <anli> I have a client side event that does not trigger when I do .click(), strange
[03:10:04] <anli> Maybe I should run that event handler manually...
[04:10:50] <teta> let's say you have one of those one page apps, with many tabs and mini blocks. one guy asks you that in one tab in one block to put a link in a text that will basically go to other tab, do a search functionality and show a box with results. what do you do? what do you do?
[04:23:40] <teta> is there a way to simulate a click event? (jquery.event) and make it go to a specific function in a specific file whith this firm?       function searchHandler(event)
[04:27:29] <user696969> hi
[04:28:45] <user696969> anyone know another plugin like this one that show at the same time the 2 elements to select the date range? http://www.daterangepicker.com/#ex1
[04:30:17] <snfgf> how can i remove the required attribute from all input elements on a page, just for testing?
[04:30:30] <snfgf> $('form input:required').attr('required', '');
[04:30:35] <snfgf> ^doesn't work, how come?
[04:42:37] <Koopz> anyone using inputmask?
[05:04:35] <netcrime> Hello. I need to make a product page (With woocommerce) user can choose table with tablecloth. Product has color attribute. I need to change tablecloth color live based on chosen attribute. How this can be accomplished? Splitting image in to separate SVG files ? Or there is any better way?
[05:05:22] <user696969> who asked about setting required to false?
[05:06:35] <user696969> you can do: '$("form input:required").prop({required: false});'
[05:09:35] <user696969> snfgf: ^^
[05:10:07] <snfgf> ty
[05:10:38] <snfgf> required is a property, no an attribute then?
[05:10:49] <user696969> yes
[05:10:50] <snfgf> and the difference is that attributes have values
[05:10:50] <snfgf> ?
[05:14:52] <user696969> snfgf: no, prop can have values too
[05:15:36] <user696969> eg: you can do : '<input type="text" required="true">'
[05:17:22] <snfgf> properties can only have boolean values?
[05:19:08] <user696969> no
[05:19:18] <user696969> '<input type="checkbox" checked="checked">'
[05:19:36] <user696969> don't ask me the real diference that I also don't know :)
[05:21:35] <AdamPDotty> the attribute value is "checked" the property might still be "true"
[05:23:10] <AdamPDotty> attribute is the html representation, property is a value in the DOM
[05:28:58] <user696969> found this: "For a given DOM node object, properties are the properties of that object, and attributes are the elements of the attributes property of that object."
[05:30:04] <user696969> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6003819/properties-and-attributes-in-html/6004028#6004028
[05:32:24] <Cork> user696969, snfgf: it is more that the value of required, checked, selected, disabled and the like doesn't matter
[05:32:48] <Cork> if you have the <input required> is completely valid
[05:32:54] <AdamPDotty> checked="unchecked" :-)
[05:34:31] <user696969> anyone know another plugin like this one that show at the same time the 2 elements to select the date range? http://www.daterangepicker.com/#ex1
[05:35:01] <Cork> jquery ui picker extension plugins?
[05:35:04] <Cork> there are plenty of those
[05:35:34] <Cork> https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jquery+ui+date+range+picker&t=vivaldi&ia=web
[05:43:13] <localh0st> Is there any way to open a link in new window instead of new tab?
[05:43:45] <localh0st> window.open(addr, "_blank"); opens addr in new tab on Chrome for me
[05:44:19] <Cork> depends on the browser sniffing values you use
[05:44:44] <Cork> i know for example firefox allows popup if you set the width+height values if i remember correctly
[05:44:56] <Cork> chrome might do the same but not sure
[05:46:06] <localh0st> Cork: ok, thanks, adding size parameters to window.open seems to work :)
[05:59:44] <blinky_> Morning all,  I have a script that I made that is working reasonable well.  It uses ajax to call a php script, processes the data and forms some html which in turn is displayed on the page.  Every 10secs the displayed div is changed and every 35secs the ajax is called again to update the data on the page.  I am wondering if there is a way of making it slightly smoother as when the data is called sometimes it will cut the final
[05:59:45] <blinky_> div short if it collects the data in less then 5secs.  Ideally the data should be updated at the end of the 10th second of the last div in the sequence. - https://hastebin.com/huboguzeju.js

[09:58:50] <tired> hey guys
[09:59:18] <tired> has anyone every had experience with using jquery inside a php for each loop?
[10:00:47] <tired> i'm creating a function inside the foreach loop but everytime it runs, the value that i want is the same across all the iterations of the foreach loop
[10:01:29] <tired> the jquery values should change based on the values inside the php foreach loop
[10:04:12] <tired> foreach ( $x as $y ) {
[10:04:16] <tired> $date = $y->date;
[10:04:24] <tired> <script type="text/javascript">
[10:04:33] <tired> $(function() {
[10:05:19] <tired> $endate = <?php echo $date[$pos]; ?>
[10:05:21] <tired> }
[10:05:25] <tired>  });
[10:05:40] <tired> anyone had any experience?
[10:09:44] <tired> hello anyone here?
[10:16:13] <localh0st> tired: wtf is that code?
[10:16:36] <localh0st> you have mixed js/html/php
[10:16:42] <localh0st> $endate = <?php echo $date[$pos]; ?>
[10:16:46] <localh0st> what is that? o_O
[10:17:09] <localh0st> $enddate is php variable
[10:17:29] <localh0st> on the right side you have some (html?) <?php echo $date[$pos]; ?>
[10:17:41] <localh0st> it just doesn't make sense at all
[10:17:46] <taplar> $enddate is global without the var
[10:18:10] <tired> ok
[10:18:10] <tired> 1
[10:18:13] <tired> http://viper-7.com/HkFCjJ
[10:18:23] <tired> i SEVERLY cut out alot of code
[10:18:29] <taplar> blinky_: dont use intervals with ajax
[10:18:50] <taplar> use a recursive timeout in the success callback
[10:25:18] <teta> how can I simulate this event manually? https://snag.gy/sBcWSa.jpg
[10:31:01] <blinky_> taplar, could you explain that one a little please?
[10:32:38] <taplar> set interval will run at a certain time frame regardless
[10:32:48] <taplar> ajax is not guarenteed to finish in a given time frame
[10:32:57] <taplar> you cannot predict network speed
[10:33:07] <blinky_> yeah that is my current issue
[10:33:14] <taplar> using set timeout with ajax can easily lead to requests stepping on each other
[10:33:17] <blinky_> do you have a link to the documentation for it?
[10:33:29] <taplar> which is why instead of using setInterval, you use set timeout
[10:33:34] <blinky_> ah
[10:33:49] <taplar> that way the timeout beings as soon as the request finishes
[10:33:57] <taplar> and it will never step on itself
[10:34:27] <taplar> "using set timeout with ajax can easily lead to requests stepping on each other " <-- that should have said set interval
[10:47:44] <teta> the first line of the file says this         (function() {                so everything in that file is a function?
[10:51:28] <taplar> yep, looks like an IIFE
[11:19:15] <codecutter> how do find the value of 'data'foo' of a child element?
[11:19:27] <codecutter> how do find the value of 'data-foo' of a child element?
[11:19:47] <taplar> do you already know how to target the child?
[11:19:57] <Cork> codecutter: you mean $('[data-foo=""]')?
[11:20:05] <codecutter> I have (event.currentTarget)
[11:20:15] <taplar> is that the child?
[11:20:16] <Cork> ah, then .data('foo')
[11:20:21] <taplar> ^ if so
[11:21:37] <codecutter> undefined
[11:21:54] <Cork> codecutter: could you provide the html structure you're working with?
[11:22:35] <codecutter> console.log( $(event.currentTarget).data('symbol' ) ); <-- event,currentTarget is the parent
[11:22:43] <codecutter> console.log( $(event.currentTarget).data('symbol' ) ); <-- event.currentTarget is the parent
[11:22:47] <taplar> so what's the child?
[11:23:01] <codecutter> div has the data-symbol
[11:23:06] <Cork> ...
[11:23:08] <codecutter> which is the child
[11:23:09] <taplar> $(event.currentTarget).find('childselector').data('symbol')
[11:23:16] <taplar> don't select by an attribute
[11:23:23] <taplar> use a class or id
[11:23:41] <Cork> and id should be avoided as your using relation
[11:23:47] <taplar> true
[11:24:51] <codecutter> that works
[11:36:16] <pete___> Hey everyone, quick question. I have a payment page that needs jQuery to function, but usually it is called as part of the footer scripts in order to increase performance. Would it cause problems if I were to load the same version of jQuery twice
[11:36:56] <Cork> pete___: it would make the page bigger and slower to load, so it is better to avoid it
[11:37:53] <Cork> pete___: also if the page has plugins loaded it means those won't be available if you load a new one without those plugins
[11:38:05] <Cork> (to them that is)
[11:38:46] <taplar> i'm confused what problem loading the same jQuery twice would fix
[11:39:06] <Cork> taplar: i suspect he want to make sure it exist in pages that doesn't load it them self
[11:39:52] <Cork> the solution there is by far better to just require that they load jquery
[11:40:07] <Cork> you can provide a small snippet that they can use if they don't have jquery
[11:40:42] <Cork> forcing a specific embedded jquery version into a page is a big pain and i strongly recommend against it
[11:41:00] <pete___> taplar: My page has to make an ajax call to work properly, but I'm loading jQuery with async to make sure it doesn't block rendering on the page
[11:41:39] <taplar> does loading async cause issues with document ready?  *eyes Cork*
[11:41:49] <Cork> yes
[11:42:12] <pete___> Ah, is there anyway to check that its loaded with async?
[11:42:21] <Cork> not really
[11:42:22] <taplar> hmm, what do you do in that point?  some sort of promise or delay until jQuery exists?
[11:42:46] <Cork> delay and hope for the best
[11:42:50] <taplar> lol
[11:43:03] <Cork> async loading of jquery if you depend on it is something that doesn't work well
[11:43:22] <Cork> so i would say either load jquery in the header and make sure to use a common cdn
[11:43:29] <Cork> or use xhr for your ajax call
[11:43:38] <Cork> (meaning don't depend on jquery)
[11:44:55] <Cork> pete___: if you can drop support for ie you can give http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch a try
[11:46:30] <JAMESBOND> if i have const elems = $('div,span,p'), is the order guaranteed? i know jquery uses faux arrays
[11:46:54] <Cork> JAMESBOND: it is following the dom element order, not the selectors
[11:47:19] <JAMESBOND> so if p comes before div it will be index 0?
[11:47:21] <Cork> meaning if you have <span></span><div></div><p></p> that is the order you will get
[11:47:24] <Cork> yes
[11:47:33] <JAMESBOND> thank you!!!!11
[11:47:49] <pete___> Cork: I wish it was that easy...
[11:48:12] <Cork> pete___: well the alternative is to use XMLHttpRequest directly
[11:48:54] <Cork> pete___: you could try making the scrip not async and put it at the end of body
[11:49:22] <Cork> if you make sure the jquery ajax call is in a script after it in the body it should be guaranteed to be blocked by the loading of it
[11:49:34] <Cork> just make sure not to use .ready or $(function() {})
[11:50:39] <pete___> Hummm... K, its pretty confusing code I wrote months ago so I'm stuff trying to figure it out :S
[11:51:47] <taplar> maybe consider reviewing the code to see if there is anyway to work in more self documentation to clear up some of the confusion
[11:51:56] <taplar> could help you in the future too
[11:52:05] <Cork> ya
[11:52:27] <Cork> leaving code as something "won't touch cause it is horrible" will just make it more horrible
[11:53:01] <Cork> take the time to make it something your "like" it makes the project easier to maintain over time
[11:53:10] <Cork> at least make it less ugly :)
[12:01:01] <pete___> Cork: True but this is out payment gateway stuff, messing it up can cost us a fair bit of money :S
[12:02:50] <taplar> increasing clarity means reducing the chance that you do mess it up, ;)

[13:21:03] <MatthewAFisher> hi
[13:21:12] <taplar> bonjour
[13:21:24] <MatthewAFisher> How do I use jquery to change a <div id=?>
[13:21:33] <taplar> you want to change it's id?
[13:21:36] <MatthewAFisher> when a button is clicked for example
[13:21:38] <MatthewAFisher> yeah
[13:21:44] <taplar> does it already have an id?
[13:21:54] <MatthewAFisher> specifically an id is being targeted by a camera is using in three.js
[13:22:02] <MatthewAFisher> and so I need to set which div has that id
[13:22:07] <MatthewAFisher> and remove it from the last div as well
[13:22:35] <taplar> $('#whateverid').attr('id', newId)
[13:22:39] <MatthewAFisher> <div> <div> <div id=on> <button onclick=set.id> ect.
[13:23:13] <MatthewAFisher> and switch it to <div id=on> <div> <div>
[15:33:16] <taplar> ba ba ba, ba baburam
[15:46:41] <ekkis> I need a little advice and am not sure if this is the right place to ask.  I have a label that does something when the mouse enters its space.  that label is in a container that moves around a bit.  on occasion the user will click on a button and the container moves such that the mouse pointer is right over the label.  as soon as the user moves the mouse, the label registers an "mouse enter" event and I need to prevent that
[15:46:45] <ekkis> any ideas?
[15:46:55] <ekkis> in essence, the user never really entered the label so the label should just see mousemove events (which it does) but really shouldn't see a mouseenter
[15:49:00] <taplar> that's really tricky.  i'd personally probably try to see if there was a way to prevent that in the first place
[15:50:50] <ekkis> I have two containers side by side so that when the left container shrinks, the right one moves left
[15:50:50] <ekkis> and that's the problem.  the user clicks on a button which causes the content of some list boxes to shrink.  and now his mouse pointer is sitting on top of the second container's label
[15:50:50] <ekkis> as soon as he moves, it hides the first container to reveal the second
[15:51:04] <ekkis> so I need a way to tell the user didn't actually ever enter the label
[15:51:31] <taplar> otherwise, maybe you could do something like creating an 'ignoreMouseEnter' variable that is always false, until you click that button.  if you get a mouse enter, don't do anything if that is true.  and set it to false on mouse move
[15:52:01] <ekkis> that's what I was thinking... a semaphore of some kind
[15:52:04] <ekkis> it's a hack
[15:52:50] <taplar> not really a semaphone.  you don't have concurrent execution
[15:52:59] <taplar> just a conditional
[15:53:49] <ekkis> yes, I guess
[15:54:18] <taplar> had to look that guy up.  haven't heard that phrase in quite a while, :)
[15:56:44] <ekkis> semaphore? I think of it as a traffic light, something that raises a hand to stop a behaviour
[15:57:11] <ekkis> I guess because in Italian stop lights are called semáforos
[15:57:21] <taplar> heh
[15:58:06] <ekkis> I think the easy way to fix this is to make the user click on the label.  I like the hover functionality but this is going to be hard to solve
[16:01:30] <taplar> what do you mean?
[16:02:57] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bh2p4awd/
[16:02:58] <ekkis> the way I had it simply moving the mouse over the label would cause stuff to happen
[16:03:04] <ekkis> so now I require a click
[16:03:28] <taplar> you can simulate it by clicking the button, right click so the menu comes up, mouse over the input, and then left click so the menu goes away.  the mouse enter message doesn't show for that
[16:03:32] <ekkis> so if the label happens to move under the cursor the mouse moves won't trigger the functionality because it now takes a click
[16:03:38] <ekkis> I like it less but it will have to do
[16:03:51] <taplar> yeah a click would be the simpliest way
[16:11:41] <pavonia> Does jsfiddle have a console window anywhere which I'm just to blind to see?
[16:14:25] <taplar> nah, you just use the browser
[16:25:33] <docmur> Hey guys, I'm having a problem with the following ajax call: https://jsfiddle.net/1ghLkyvo/  If I don't sent the headers portion, I can send my data fine, if I set the headers, then one the other other side it's not seeing the data, how can I fix this?
[16:38:58] <taplar> docmur: that data isn't json
[16:39:36] <taplar> well i was looking at the other variable
[16:40:23] <docmur> If I send the data in the header, it seems to work fine, but that seems like a bad hack to me
[16:40:48] <taplar> what do you mean the data in the header?
[16:41:52] <docmur> if I add something like 'data': data, into the headers section, under the userToken
[16:42:00] <docmur> that way I can pick it up in PHP with $_SERVER
[16:45:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1ghLkyvo/1/
[16:45:37] <taplar> the json object is there just for the jsfiddle echo method, but that's a working echo example
[16:53:26] <ekkis> is there any way to wait for a .change()?
[16:54:05] <taplar> what do you mean?  attaching a change event handler is essentially that
[16:54:45] <ekkis> there is an event handler attached and I trigger it with a .change() but I want to wait for the handler to complete before I move on
[16:55:06] <ekkis> the call to the handler happens asynchronously
[16:55:41] <taplar> no, there isn't a wait
[16:55:48] <ekkis> .change() is equivalent to .trigger(...)
[16:55:56] <taplar> you can attach another change handler which should execute after the first one finishes iirc
[16:56:06] <ekkis> but .trigger() doesn't provide a callback so I can wait for it to finish
[16:56:44] <taplar> why not call your logic at the end of your other change handler?
[16:59:45] <ekkis> because it's at a different level of the abstraction
[17:06:56] <GeekMonkey> hey anyone familiar with Magnific popup?
[17:07:20] <GeekMonkey> I am using an iframe and it opens the suddenly redirects to the url of the iframe
[17:20:40] <hellyeah> yo
[17:20:49] <taplar> aloha
[17:48:56] <Srgjames> so im using this command tell if a checkbox has been checked or not(  var Chosen_Character_Value = $("input:checkbox").is(":checked"); ) How can i get the id of the checked box
[17:49:19] <taplar> prop('id')
[17:49:32] <taplar> or attr('id')
[17:59:15] <Srgjames> taplar so i tried  $("input:checkbox").prop('id') but it is giving me the same id for all of them would i have to set up event to have it beable to change with the selected check box
[18:34:15] <Srgjames> I tried $("input:checkbox").prop('id') and it only gets me the id of the first box selected if i select another box the id doesnt change.
[18:34:20] <Srgjames> How can I fix that
[19:26:18] <Gsham> is it bad to use jquery's load() on all the links in the menu if i can just change out the content in the main div
[19:26:19] <Gsham> or is this bad practice?
[20:07:53] <Jooeeeee> some reason, my parents().children() call is not working... could it be because the children I'm trying to target are using sortable() ?
[20:37:05] <Jooeeeee> https://jsfiddle.net/hmw8jem5/
[20:37:31] <Jooeeeee> if anyone can help me figure out why the parents() returns fine, but the children() does not
[20:37:46] <Jooeeeee> its suppose to delete the link
[20:38:16] <Jooeeeee> i stripped a bunch of classes/text, but the problem still persists
[20:47:23] <Jooeeeee> son of a... i should have used .find() instead of .children(), oh well
[21:29:42] <ryantheleach> This is probably a super simple question if someone has a good reference. This is my first time extending a jquery widget,  and I want to create a new widget that looks like a jqm button, but with custom behavior.  Is there any resources anywhere I can use to learn, preferrably jqm specific?
[22:00:49] <srgjames_> So I have procedurally generated checkboxes with Ids that are different . I can use var Chosen_Character_Value = $("input:checkbox").prop('checked'); gives me the correct information but when i var Chosen_Character_Id = $("input:checkbox").prop('id'); it only grabbs the first button that is clicked. how can i get it to respond with the Id of the Checkbox selected.
[22:03:08] <ryantheleach> $("input:checkbox") returns *all* jquery checkboxes. You will probably want to somehow limit that to the last one inside a specific div, or loop over them all parsing the id's
[22:03:30] <ryantheleach> a better bet would be to not read it from the last checkbox, and keep the current value that you are up to cached.
