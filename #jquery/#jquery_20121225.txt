[00:24:44] <aqeel> hi channel
[00:25:58] <jastor> trinadh_: had completely forgotten !important ;)
[00:26:25] <aqeel> !important...???
[00:26:31] <aqeel> in css??
[00:26:34] <trinadh_> jastor: happens :)
[00:26:37] <trinadh_> hi aqueel:
[00:26:42] <trinadh_> yes
[00:27:00] <aqeel> well it is for reinforcement
[00:28:07] <aqeel> trinadh_: http://www.yellowjug.com/web-design/the-importance-of-important-in-css/
[00:28:13] <jastor> trinadh_: ive "solved" it with data-role and data-theme ... but not in the way id like .. besides i still find it weird that css isnt cascading in this case ;) .. gonna check firebug like you said and see if the css is loaded twice
[00:29:03] <jastor> "not in the way id like" ergo: not in the way you normally use data-role and data-theme
[00:30:50] <aqeel> trinadh_: webdesign.about.com/od/css/f/blcssfaqimportn.htm
[00:31:27] <trinadh_> jastor: I get this problem sometimes when I use css which accompanies plugins or libraries , usually !important solves the issue, but in fact it indicates a problem with the stylesheets..
[00:33:23] <trinadh_> aqeel: whats with !important links.. :)
[00:33:44] <aqeel> for your refernce
[00:33:50] <aqeel> as to what it means
[00:34:21] <aqeel> do not overuse !important
[00:35:13] <jastor> trinadh_: we got a mystery on our hand .. in the htmlcode the jquery css is first .. but according to firebug the mobile css is loaded AFTER my css
[00:35:22] <trinadh_> yes, I agree with you :) , like I said, having to use !important more times indicates a problem with css
[00:35:50] <aqeel> it becomes a clutter of puzzles
[00:36:02] <aqeel> ok got to go...see in 1/2 an hour
[00:36:05] <aqeel> bye
[00:36:08] <jastor> same thing in chrome .. havent tried safari yet
[00:36:19] <aqeel> bye channel
[00:36:31] <jastor> hmm
[00:38:42] <trinadh_> jastor: are you sure it is loading the mobile css you pointed to...
[00:39:08] <jastor> trinadh_: there is only 2 css files in the html code .. my own and the mobiel css
[00:39:35] <jastor> but anyway .. this isnt an jquery issue anylonger
[00:39:57] <trinadh_> yes, I was just asking as, OpenLayers, a library I work with loads css from online if it doesnt find the css I specify, a fallback
[00:40:11] <trinadh_> just wanted to be sure it is nothing like that
[00:40:19] <jastor> ah no .. local files
[00:41:33] <trinadh_> ok..
[00:53:41] <trinadh_> _jastor: be it chrome or safari or ff , html is to be parsed in order and I don't think any browser will do it any other way
[00:58:16] <_jastor> trinadh_: i know .. thats why i said its a mystery

[01:27:41] <grass7boy> can i bind an event that jquery is loaded in this page
[01:28:11] <grass7boy> such that document.addEvenetListener("jQueryLoaded", function(){ /* handler */})
[01:28:56] <OneBraveHog> jastor - lost me

[01:29:17] * OneBraveHog said 'head'
[01:29:25] * OneBraveHog he said 'head'
[01:29:35] <grass7boy> the handler will be triggered

[01:38:16] <trinadh> _jastor: any luck with the css issue
[01:40:03] <_jastor> trinadh: i solved it with !important but it doesnt explain the weirdness .. ohwell .. i started working on a wordpress theme instead ;)
[01:41:10] <_jastor> trinadh: does jquery mobile have problems visiting urls with a hash? .. for some reason nothing happens when clicking on http://wordpress/post#comments for example  .. but http://wordpress/post  works
[01:41:13] <trinadh> _jastor: oh.. ok... :)
[01:48:54] <trinadh> _jastor: am not sure, http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/pages/docs-navmodel.html , is that of any help?
[01:50:48] <_jastor> trinadh: now that i think about it .. it could probably be solved by bypassing the ajax loading
[01:50:58] <_jastor> trinadh: disabling it i mean
[01:53:40] <_jastor> could/should
[02:01:07] <trinadh> _jastor: :) , you are using chrome right..
[02:05:15] <_jastor> trinadh: no .. firefox ;) .. after some searching it seems like that its common knowledge that having your own hash in urls breaks jquery
[02:05:23] <_jastor> +mobile
[02:05:31] <_jastor> trinadh: i got chrome installed too though
[02:06:24] <trinadh> _jastor: oh.. thats something to remember...
[02:06:35] <_jastor> trinadh: :)
[02:06:59] <_jastor> trinadh: "known limitation"
[02:08:40] <trinadh> _jastor: well , I was actually trying to see about the earlier mystery by recreating in a simple way, but it seems to work as it should, in chrome it shows what line a request in invoked, so thought may be you could see what is invoking the request for css file
[02:09:31] <trinadh> _jastor: well may be for jqm dev's and users , am not for now ;) , so going to remember it when /if I have to work with it
[02:12:11] <_jastor> trinadh: gonna do a $("a [href~=#]"). stop of ajax loading of those urls
[02:13:24] <_jastor> trinadh: doing it by php/wordpress is more work than its worth
[02:14:58] <_jastor> hmm .. had hoped $("a [href~=#]").attr("rel","external"); would solve it .. you wouldnt happen to know the jquery command to prevent a selectors ajax loading?
[02:17:38] <trinadh> _jastor: slectors ajax loading... ?
[02:18:16] <trinadh> you mean when you click they shouldn't do what they normally do...
[02:18:20] <_jastor> trinadh: to prevent a selector being loaded by ajax .. so it acts like a normal link
[02:18:37] <_jastor> tried unbind("click"); :/
[02:19:12] <OneBraveHog> this all sounds so foreign to me
[02:19:16] <_jastor> the selector in this case being a [href~=#]
[02:19:17] <OneBraveHog> it's like another PLANET
[02:19:21] <OneBraveHog> SELECTOR ?
[02:20:07] <OneBraveHog> ~-#>
[02:20:09] <OneBraveHog> ~-#
[02:20:22] <OneBraveHog> what the HELL does ~=# translate to ?
[02:20:34] <_jastor> OneBraveHog: all urls containing a #
[02:20:36] <OneBraveHog> the hell part is to amplify my own incompetence !:)
[02:20:39] <OneBraveHog> oh
[02:21:09] <OneBraveHog> it just seems to foreign to me - I have SO much to learn
[02:21:23] <OneBraveHog> but...this is all good- seeing it for round #1
[02:21:33] <OneBraveHog> round #2 - I can say- ah - ok - that looks FAMILIAR
[02:21:38] <_jastor> $("a [href~=#]").unbind();  didnt work either :/
[02:21:39] <OneBraveHog> round #3 ? Hey- I get that
[02:21:55] <OneBraveHog> something tells me though
[02:22:00] <OneBraveHog> I'm NEVER going to get this
[02:22:06] <OneBraveHog> esp. on that last ref by jastor
[02:22:17] <OneBraveHog> $("a ?
[02:22:25] <OneBraveHog> the $ part I know is Jquery ref
[02:22:35] <OneBraveHog> some kind of ANY anchor there I guess
[02:22:43] <_jastor> yup
[02:22:49] <OneBraveHog> but the .unbind ? no clue - I must learn what that does
[02:23:18] <OneBraveHog> hey - happy holidays people
[02:23:36] <OneBraveHog> it's ALLLLLLL good

[06:06:12] <vladyn> sean`: many thanks I'm looking at it now
[06:06:31] <vladyn> actually I'm using pickadate.js plug-in but it's similar
[08:07:12] <molavy> hi
[08:07:37] <molavy> i used an click event with stoppropogation
[08:07:49] <molavy> but i want except on element
[08:08:11] <molavy> <a> <b></b></a>
[08:09:35] <molavy> $(b).click(){e.stoppropagation()}
[08:09:55] <molavy> but i want a triger click if on b clicked
[08:10:01] <molavy> how can i implement this
[08:10:33] <molavy> <a> <p><b></b></p></a>
[08:10:38] <molavy> any idea?
[08:11:46] <molavy> there is no idea?
[08:15:44] <Andreas> Hello
[08:15:51] <molavy> there is no idea?
[08:16:26] <Andreas> Does anyone know a good library or modified version of jQuery that can be used for a Windows 8 application?
[08:21:18] <molavy> there is really no idea?
[08:24:13] <molavy> how can i implement this , i really need it
[08:24:18] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:25:11] <molavy> i want trigger event on a parent element when a child clicked ,but child used e.stoppropagation()
[08:25:27] <molavy> how can i find click on child happen
[08:27:21] <molavy> 750 online with no answer
[08:33:04] <rindolf> molavy: hi.
[08:33:14] <rindolf> molavy: why does the child use that?
[08:33:19] <rindolf> molavy: can't you remove it?
[08:33:25] <molavy> no,
[08:33:27] <rindolf> molavy: and lots of people here are idling.
[08:34:36] <shoky> molavy: then why are you using stopPropagation() ?
[08:34:49] <shoky> molavy: or, use it on the <p> instead of the <b>  ?
[08:34:57] <molavy> for parent don't trigger click
[08:35:12] <shoky> but why on the <b> ... you DO want its parent to trigger click
[08:35:50] <molavy> but i want first parent trigger it
[08:38:17] <shoky> molavy: anyway. you can do without stopPropagation()..  $('a').click(function(e) { ... check e.target here and do what you want ... })
[08:41:03] <molavy> i can't understand why when i firefox console i write $("a").click(function(){console.log("ok")})
[08:43:31] <molavy> it work m but on code when i use $("a").click(function(e){console.log("ok")})
[08:43:37] <molavy> it don't work
[08:43:43] <molavy> shoky,
[08:44:21] <molavy> what is different between this two line
[08:44:39] <shoky> that doesn't make sense to me either, molavy
[08:44:50] <shoky> unless thats not the full code and you're referring to 'e' somewhere in there
[08:45:10] <molavy> $("a").live("click",function(e){console.log("ok")})
[08:45:18] <shoky> eh
[08:45:22] <molavy> sorry
[08:45:31] <shoky> ?demo @ molavy
[08:45:31] <bot-t> molavy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[09:01:17] <diverdude> Hello. i have How can i make a div-box which always spans the entire page height?
[09:04:48] <cuebix> diverdude: set it to be absolutely positioned, and give it a top and left of 0 and a width and height of 100%
[09:05:14] <diverdude> cuebix, that will only give it the height of the viewport. not the entire page
[09:05:59] <cuebix> diverdude: then wrap the body of the page in that div
[09:07:02] <cuebix> it won't need to be absolutely positioned in that case.
[09:07:10] <shoky> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KtUxt/1/
[09:07:13] <shoky> one way..
[09:08:31] <shoky> diverdude: and another way.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KtUxt/2/
[09:08:55] <diverdude> shoky, hmmm so this is the magic part? * { box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box }
[09:09:20] <shoky> ?g paul irish box sizing @ diverdude
[09:09:22] <bot-t> diverdude, * { box-sizing: border-box } FTW ´ Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/
[09:09:42] <shoky> diverdude: that part makes it so the border:5px  is considered part of the height/width of the div
[09:10:01] <shoky> so it makes it all much easier to deal with
[09:10:48] <shoky> diverdude: the magic is in all the parts together though.  for example in the 2nd example, the position:relative is needed on <body>
[09:11:19] <shoky> actually jsfiddle's "normalize css" checkbox is checked there
[09:11:51] <shoky> would need margin:0 padding:0 on body also withot it
[09:28:03] <diverdude> Is it possible to check somehow if a given element has a specific element as parent, grandparent, greatgreatparent etc? (predecessor)
[09:35:14] <shoky> ?closest
[09:35:14] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:57:55] <diverdude> shoky, so i could use closest to check if the div containing niv0 is a predecessor? http://jsfiddle.net/WbWSa/19/
[10:00:00] <diverdude> shoky, i need to react on clicks that has been done only in the div0 box, and not in its ancestors
[10:00:06] <diverdude> shoky, is that possible?
[10:02:39] <karolyi> use event.target
[10:14:50] <diverdude> why is it printing false when i press niv0 or niv1 or niv2 in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/WbWSa/29/
[10:22:53] <w00tnerz> yes
[10:55:52] <nickelnick> hey all merry xmas
[10:56:18] <nickelnick> i'm looking for a geolocation script that i can setup as a tooltip for a link where i hover over the ip address and it shows me the location of the ip and all that jazz
[10:56:23] <nickelnick> any tips?
[10:59:08] <Absolute0> Is there an event that gets fired when a div's contents change? I tried .change but got no response: http://jsfiddle.net/hj88X/
[11:20:31] <nickelnick> absolute: i would think you need to do something like get the length of the div
[11:20:42] <nickelnick> of the html inside it
[11:22:50] <nickelnick> $('#somediv").html().length or some thing maybe
[11:31:43] <Absolute0> nickelnick: that doesn't fire an event.
[11:33:05] <nickelnick> oh my bad i read wrong..doing too many things at once
[11:33:41] <nickelnick> you'd probably have to use keyPress
[11:33:51] <nickelnick> err keyDown etc
[11:34:23] <nickelnick> i've had to use that with setTimeout before
[12:19:51] <aaairc> what would be he query to to select the second "#text" url in this json example: http://pastebin.com/QFUxCrJX
[12:20:17] <aaairc> I tried to do this, but it doesn't seem to work:  "image[1].#text"
[12:20:36] <aaairc> *what would be the jquery
[12:21:03] <cuebix> it's not jQuery, it's javascript: image[1]["#text"]
[12:22:07] <cuebix> When you have special characters as keys in an object, you have to use array notation to get the property.
[12:22:34] <aaairc> cuebix: ahh, thanks! that special character was screwing me up.
[12:22:41] <cuebix> np
[13:02:34] <OneBraveHog> why is <ul> used so much with JQuery ?
[13:04:04] <Already> because your elements are in the DOM in a structured way that works even when JS is disabled i'd guess.
[13:05:22] <rindolf> OneBraveHog: <ul> is a useful tag.
[13:48:10] <RonWhoCares> I am wondering how to populate all the fields of an address using a JQuery / ajax https://www.theverseoftheday.info/ebay-wallet-card-selection/

[15:32:42] <wroathe> whoops
[15:46:00] <enav-ml> hello
[15:46:20] <enav-ml> i come from motools, and im trying to adapt to jquery
[15:48:35] <enav-ml> for example i got a doc with 10 p elements, lets say i want to hide the 5th p element, on mootools i used to do something like $$('p')[4].set('style', 'display:none')
[15:49:14] <enav-ml> im trying to figure out how to manipulate an single element from a collection of elements
[15:49:32] <enav-ml> so i tried on jquery  $('p')[4].hide();   and it gaves me an error
[15:55:02] <Eviltwin> enav-ml: That's because that doesn't work
[15:55:16] <enav-ml> of course is not
[15:55:27] <enav-ml> im not trying to force a cat to be a dog
[15:55:37] <enav-ml> im just trying to learn how the dog works
[15:55:44] <Eviltwin> Go here: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics
[15:55:49] <Eviltwin> And look at "Getting single elements from a selection"
[15:55:54] <enav-ml> but the docs are not helping me much
[15:56:05] <enav-ml> thanks mate
[15:56:29] <Eviltwin> If you read the two-or-so paragraphs there it should explald pretty well
[16:01:27] <E3D3> javascript
[16:18:48] <aaairc> i want to have a search function that waits one second to trigger an action, but if its called a second time during the first second... it restarts the timer to wait one second to trigger the action
[16:18:54] <aaairc> not sure if that makes sense.
[16:19:22] <aaairc> does anyone have any suggestions on how to accomplish that?
[16:19:54] <aaairc> can i set a timer to a variable... and then just keep resetting the timer until a full second goes buy to trigger the action?
[16:46:00] <innociv> How can I have two while() run simutaniously?
[16:46:07] <innociv> Instead of synchronously one after the other
[18:00:53] <diverdude> is it possible to lock the screen so that user cannot scroll?
[18:02:16] <ravenzz> overflow: hidden; (css) ?
[19:07:52] <aaairc> is it possible to have jQuery.getJSON() return a value... or is that not possible because its asychronous?
[19:10:13] <shoky> aaairc: correct, its asynchronous so you cant simply return a value
[19:10:51] <shoky> aaairc: but you can do something like:  var request = $.getJSON('url');  ....    request.done(function(data) { console.log(data) })
[19:11:33] <aaairc> shoky: the issue is, is that i have three functions that are all asychronous and i only want to do something once all three have finished.
[19:11:47] <aaairc> shoky: so i'm not quite sure how to setup a callback that will only execute when all three are done.
[19:12:28] <shoky> aaairc:  var req1 = $.getJSON('url1'), req2 = $.getJSON('url2');  $.when(req1, req2).done(function(data1, data2) { console.log(data1,data2) })
[19:12:33] <shoky> ?$.when @ aaairc
[19:12:37] <bot-t> aaairc, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/

[19:14:06] <shoky> that should keep you busy
[19:14:23] <aaairc> shoky: thanks for the guidance
[19:30:06] <codepython777> I need to poll for some events on the backend and refresh my ui accordingly. Are there any jquery or other plugins/libs that i should look at for this?
[19:37:22] <shoky> so you want a plugin/lib that polls for some unknown events on an unknown backend, and "refreshes" an unknown UI
[19:37:32] <shoky> sounds feasible.
[19:38:44] <skypce> hello guys, happy christimasss
[19:38:48] <skypce> i have this:<li id="menu-218-1" class="first odd sf-item-1 sf-depth-1 sf-no-children">
[19:38:48] <skypce> <a class="sf-depth-1 active" data-thmr="thmr_6" href="/testing/">
[19:38:48] <skypce> <span class="page-name">
[19:38:48] <skypce> </a>
[19:38:48] <skypce> </li>
[19:39:19] <skypce> how can i leave span out of a element?
[19:39:29] <skypce> but inside of li
[19:39:36] <codepython777> shoky: my backend is python and i can pretty much control it the way i like. My frontend is jquery/js+html+css
[19:39:55] <shoky> codepython777: if you want something to help you organize that shit, look at MVC-style frameworks..
[19:40:03] <ziyourenxiang> or websockets
[19:40:23] <shoky> e.g. backbone/angular/ember/knockout/whatever
[19:40:34] <codepython777> websockets - cant do since i have port issues
[19:41:02] <codepython777> can backbone keep its model on the server and "VC" on the client browser - does it use polling for updates?
[19:41:56] <shoky> backbone itself is pretty small, can be extended for lotsa shit tho
[19:42:05] <shoky> i dont use it myself so cant help ya
[19:42:35] <ziyourenxiang> codepython777, websockets work like STARTTLS, not like ftp using new ports.
[19:43:21] <shoky> codepython777 if you want a nice overview of the most popular frameworks.. http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/
[19:46:52] <codepython777> shoky: thanks for the linke

[20:24:39] <kozero> Any one know best js plugin for video on cross browsers ? or any suggestion ?
[21:00:56] <rindolf> kozero: hi.
[21:01:32] <rindolf> kozero: I saw some hackery of the <video> tag with a Fallback to flash mentioned somewhere.
[21:19:49] <kozero> rindolf: hi
[21:20:53] <kozero> i use videojs (http://videojs.com/)
[21:22:30] <kozero> But i see mp4 file don't working on some browser
[21:23:02] <kozero> i don't know why ?
[21:23:02] <vladikoff> kozero, also http://mediaelementjs.com/ :)
[21:24:41] <kozero> thanks vladikoff, i will test it.
[22:11:30] <eph3meral> anyone know why console.log($myElement) results in [<input>, context: <input>] but I can't use $myElement.prop('checked', true);
[22:11:39] <eph3meral> it appears to have "no effect" though I'm certain it gets run
[22:11:45] <eph3meral> i've stepped through the debugger
[22:13:38] <eph3meral> if I always return false from a checkbox's onclick handler, will that prevent me from being able to mark the box as checked?
[22:26:46] <VectorX> i got a $(".showcase").click() , what do i need to click all of them at once
[22:28:47] <Eviltwin> ...that does
[22:28:57] <Eviltwin> As close to all at once as you can
[22:29:03] <EasyCo> hey guys, I've got a jquery object like this: $('<g>stuff</g><path>stuff</path>') which looks like this in the console ['<g>‚Ä¶', '<path>‚Ä¶']
[22:29:25] <EasyCo> How would I go about selecting just the stuff within and including <g>
[22:30:13] <Eviltwin> see ?eq
[22:30:19] <Eviltwin> ?see .eq
[22:30:24] <Eviltwin> Hmm
[22:30:35] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/eq
[22:31:06] <EasyCo> That's by index though
[22:31:12] <EasyCo> The index can be different
[22:32:05] <EasyCo> I was hoping I could supply it a html like structure and user .find()
[22:32:38] <EasyCo> Basically instead of looking at the document, use this supplied string and match the element
[22:38:52] <trinadh> EasyCo: :contains maybe..
[22:39:12] <EasyCo> What I found was...
[22:40:03] <EasyCo> $("<g>stuff</g><path>more stuff>/path") will result in ['<g>‚Ä¶</g>','<path>‚Ä¶</path>']
[22:40:20] <EasyCo> but if you wrap the elements
[22:40:50] <EasyCo> $("<div><g>stuff</g><path>more stuff</path></div>") will result in ['<div></div>']
[22:41:00] <EasyCo> and using .find('g') will work
[22:43:01] <Eviltwin> Maybe look at .filter()
[22:43:43] <EasyCo> Yes!
[22:43:49] <EasyCo> Filter's the ticket
[22:43:59] <EasyCo> Good man, thanks
[22:46:02] <VectorX> beside using .trigger how can i run the click even of a bunch of objects that has a class assinged to it ?
[23:08:16] <eph3meral> VectorX: $('a').click(); should do the trick I would think
[23:08:44] <stormbytes> hello folks
[23:09:07] <stormbytes> how do you say 'select all *sibbling text-inputs that have a 'rel' attribute of 'foo' ?
[23:11:37] <stormbytes> can someone help me with that bit of syntax?
[23:11:38] <stormbytes> how do you say 'select all *sibbling text-inputs that have a 'rel' attribute of 'foo' ?
