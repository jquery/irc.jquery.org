[00:36:27] <hak> Hello is it possible to simulate clicks with jquery on external site. For example I would like to code bot which solves http://minesweeperonline.com/
[00:43:06] <Cork> hak: not from a third party site no
[00:43:15] <Cork> hak: if you run as trusted code in a browser you can
[00:43:23] <deacsah> exactly, like a plugin
[00:44:09] <hak> So it is possible to run plugin in browser which can interact with sites
[00:45:00] <deacsah> you can make a FF add on with their dev kit
[00:45:30] <deacsah> and run your own JS in the browser
[00:45:56] <hak> deacsah: FF? What is it?
[00:46:02] <deacsah> firefox mate
[00:46:36] <hak> Looks like you can make bookmark in chrome with javascript. It will be run in context of page when you click it.
[00:46:50] <deacsah> wow that would be a lot easier
[00:47:49] <hak> Also I see it is possible to include jQuery in your bookmark
[00:47:59] <hak> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18872679/function-as-google-chrome-bookmark
[00:48:06] <Cork> hak: or you can create user script
[00:48:20] <Cork> there is plenty of ways to do it
[00:48:22] <deacsah> or just use the concsole :D
[00:49:05] <deacsah> or run a js script from console document.body.appendChild(scriptPath);

[01:18:58] <Jakey> hi whats the best way to create a select box inject into a form
[01:21:31] <Cork> Jakey: depends on how dynamic it needs to be
[01:23:38] <Xatenev> Jakey: Just $(selector).append('createnewField') probably
[01:25:11] <Jakey> yes

[02:24:09] <justme> hi
[02:26:54] <justme> can someone tell me, if there is a problem with jQuery and ASP.net? I´m currently working with both, and I want jQuery to uncheck a checkbox which does somehow not work. The thing I´m trying to do does however work without ASP: sfiddle.net/JjHVW/
[02:27:45] <Woet> justme: how could a backend language affect a frontend library again?
[02:28:29] <justme> its from Microsoft
[02:28:44] <justme> and it does some wired stuff to the html
[02:28:59] <Woet> okay, so, for starters
[02:29:02] <Woet> did you check the console?
[02:30:12] <justme> yes, I did. Somehow I dont have access to the element if I do alert($("#idOfElement") ); then the text displayed is null
[02:30:36] <Woet> justme: give us a demo link.
[02:32:37] <justme> The demo link to a working version is this: http://jsfiddle.net/JjHVW/. But I cant give you a demo to the actual ASP stuff, as it is code from the company I´m working for.

[02:35:43] <Woet> justme: why can't you give a link to the actual demo?
[02:35:53] <Woet> it's frontend code, visitors will get it regardless.

[03:01:57] <Manu___> how to execute function from a variable .. where variable contains function name
[03:02:09] <Manu___> instead of eval
[03:03:05] <Jakey> hi
[03:03:27] <Jakey> i need help with $.on() function
[03:03:48] <Jakey> nvm
[03:04:54] <sacho_> Manu___, you should avoid having such a problem altogether. Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/oe0ws4rL/
[03:05:25] <sacho_> Manu___, basically, assign the functions you want to call to properties of some object, then use the object to access them
[03:06:16] <Jakey> hey i need help with retrieving the <input> value? whats the jquery way to do it?
[03:06:51] <Manu___> ok, how to pass the paramter inside setTimeout(autoRefresh(fnc), 5000); page has stopped when I executed this ..
[03:07:00] <sacho_> Jakey, .val()
[03:07:05] <Jakey> yes
[03:07:07] <Manu___> Jakey-> $('input').val()
[03:07:15] <Jakey> i just seen that
[03:07:18] <Jakey> on jquery doc
[03:07:26] <Jakey> you guys need to be faster
[03:07:29] <sacho_> Manu___, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout
[03:08:17] <sacho_> Manu___, IE has poor support for the parameter style though(IE10 required)
[03:08:20] <sacho_> so you have two other options
[03:08:32] <sacho_> setTimeout(function () { autoRefresh(fnc) }, 5000)
[03:08:43] <sacho_> or setTimeout(autoRefresh.bind(null, fnc), 5000)
[03:08:54] <Manu___> ok got it, thanks

[04:34:12] <hep_> Hello. Is there a way to make a popup call another popup?
[04:34:43] <hep_> I have a popup link to another internal popup page and it is not working. :(
[04:50:29] <Cork> hep_: what do you mean by "popup"?
[04:52:29] <hep_> Cork: I have a link that pops up another internal page. And on that internal page I want to popup another one.
[04:52:46] <Cork> you just restated the same comment...
[04:52:50] <Cork> what do you mean by popup?
[04:53:14] <hep_> Cork: I am not sure how to explain it. Let me create a gist and send it. Give me a minute.
[04:53:40] <Cork> hep_: is it an element inside the page "designed" to look like a popup
[04:53:46] <Cork> is it an window.alert()
[04:53:51] <Cork> or window.open()
[04:53:54] <Cork> or...??
[04:53:58] <Cork> flash?
[04:53:59] <Cork> java?
[04:54:00] <Cork> what?
[04:58:42] <hep_> Cork: Its Jquery Mobile
[04:59:44] <hep_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/881654d9904835f45ed9
[05:01:47] <hep_> Cork: Crap there is a mistake in that gist
[05:03:21] <hep_> Cork: Here this one is corrected: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/428b990bfb93611dac23
[05:06:17] <hep_> Cork: Again this is just the native jquerymobile stuff.
[05:14:47] <jnhghy> I want to detect when a user presses esc and give the user an alert but not when pressing esc in a modal(dialog) I've bid the alert like this: $(document).keydown(function(e){ how can I make only the modal to unbid this?
[05:33:02] <stampz> hi
[05:33:12] <stampz> why this doesnt work :  http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/2p4hzz1g/
[05:36:21] <jnhghy> stampz: would this be a solution? http://jsfiddle.net/2p4hzz1g/1/
[05:37:12] <Cork> stampz: you're html is invalid
[05:37:21] <Cork> you have the ul as a child if the parent ul
[05:37:26] <Cork> it should be a child of the il
[05:39:26] <Cork> stampz: http://jsfiddle.net/2p4hzz1g/2/
[05:40:10] <Cork> uh "a child of the li" -_-'
[05:42:25] <stampz> Thanks Cork, but it shoulds appear on last level : Chapitre 3.1.1.1
[05:45:25] <Cork> stampz: list-style-image is for the ul
[05:45:43] <Cork> so you would have to check if the ul has any li > ul
[05:49:05] <Cork> stampz: so something like http://jsfiddle.net/2p4hzz1g/3/
[05:49:16] <Cork> hmm opps
[05:50:09] <Cork> there http://jsfiddle.net/2p4hzz1g/4/
[05:51:31] <stampz> awesome stuff Cork, thanks !
[05:53:16] <Jakey> guys i need help selecting a row in a table
[05:53:19] <Jakey> http://jsfiddle.net/38cwod2m/
[05:53:21] <Jakey> ^
[05:53:51] <stampz> now i'm trying to finalyze the thing : when i click on the +, it hides the children, click again, it displays them : http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/2p4hzz1g/5/
[05:53:58] <Jakey> what i want to do is to change the <tr> attribute class of that row if the column 'Header 3' is equal to yes
[05:54:31] <Jakey> Cork:
[05:55:28] <stampz> why Cork ?
[05:56:02] <decx> $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).children().eq(2).text() === 'yes'; }).css('background','red')
[05:56:08] <Cork> stampz: it doesn't work like that
[05:56:25] <Cork> stampz: js is functional not declarative
[05:57:47] <Jakey> Cork: what about mine? can you look
[05:58:03] <Cork> Jakey: i think decx just answered you're question
[05:59:27] <stampz> what do you mean Cork ?
[05:59:52] <Cork> stampz: if(){ bind show } else { bind hide }
[05:59:56] <Cork> you can't do it like that
[06:00:21] <Cork> you have to bind click and in the click handler check the state
[06:00:31] <stampz> there is a onclick event, so i should make test after the click ?
[06:00:37] <stampz> ok
[06:00:44] <Cork> the check happens on dom ready
[06:01:18] <Cork> stampz: also note that the plus mark will be part of the ul element
[06:01:41] <Cork> actually, you most likely want to move that marker into a :before css rule instead
[06:02:00] <stampz> if($( "li:has(ul)" ).css('display') != 'none')
[06:02:05] <stampz> http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/2p4hzz1g/6/
[06:05:07] <Jakey> thanks decx
[06:05:11] <Jakey> that was fast
[06:05:45] * Jakey looks up filter function
[06:05:54] <Jakey> need to understand
[06:28:39] <pdcmoreira> guys, i'm using Masonry plugin (http://masonry.desandro.com/) all over my app. It makes the blocks appear like:
[06:28:43] <pdcmoreira> 1 2 3
[06:28:44] <pdcmoreira> 4
[06:28:51] <pdcmoreira> 4 5 6 *
[06:28:56] <pdcmoreira> 7 8 9
[06:28:59] <notchris> Hey, having an issue with the following: http://pastebin.com/iUzzkX6p
[06:29:12] <pdcmoreira> but now i've realized that they should instead display like:
[06:29:19] <pdcmoreira> 1 4 7
[06:29:26] <pdcmoreira> 2 5 8
[06:29:30] <pdcmoreira> 3 6 9
[06:29:47] <pdcmoreira> is there any way to make it switch to this display mode?
[06:32:23] <gtristan> there is .after() and .before().... .append() and .prepend()... is there really no such thing as an .insert() which takes an index ?
[06:34:37] <BillCriswell> gtristan: You can use .eq(n) and .next()
[06:35:47] <gtristan> BillCriswell, but that would require that I have a jquery object of all the elements in say, a table
[06:36:20] <BillCriswell> gtristan: ah duh there's an insertAfter()
[06:37:18] <gtristan> :-/
[06:37:54] <BillCriswell> I meant .eq(n) and .after() originally.
[06:37:57] <BillCriswell> Is that what you meant.
[06:38:09] <gtristan> eh, I'll figure something out I guess - the problem is that the table can be large, so I'm lazy loading it (or about to)
[06:38:48] <gtristan> now I might have a bunch of rows already, and I know the 'content changed', which means the sort order may have changed, some records may have been added, and some removed
[06:39:36] <gtristan> so in a timeout, I need to a.) remove up to BATCH_SIZE rows and ensure that the rows in the table are in the correct order... and after all unneeded rows are removed, b.) Start inserting rows at the correct positions
[06:40:17] <gtristan> in all of this, I have basically an array of UIDs which represent what the content should be, in what order
[06:41:12] <gtristan> executing .eq() on a set of all elements sounds a bit silly, since every time I would have to recreate the jquery object which has the correct list
[06:41:13] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[06:42:01] <kingfisher64> does anybody know how to stop the text appearing backwards on http://anaford.ch/ when you hover the greenish/yellow meet the team photos?
[06:42:07] <BillCriswell> gtristan: Then just select like $('tr').filter(function() { return $(this).data('id') === 'someuid'; }).after(someNewRows);
[06:42:11] <BarnaSzalai> ever see such thing? using removeAttr('id') doesnt remove the id ,but puts a "1" into it
[06:42:20] <BarnaSzalai> how is it possible?
[06:43:00] <gtristan> BillCriswell, sounds CPU intensive honestly :-/
[06:43:26] <BillCriswell> Are you paginating the table? How many rows are we talking?
[06:43:40] <gtristan> right now not that many, around 1000
[06:44:19] <gtristan> but even without any DOM manipulation, causing the table to become visible already causes the browser to be sluggish
[06:44:48] <gtristan> so I'm thinking load on demand and in batches of 50 or 100 will be cleaner
[06:44:48] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: I'm not seeing that. Any specific browser?
[06:45:04] <kingfisher64> firefox 34 i'm on BillCriswell
[06:45:23] <kingfisher64> i'm trying to help a friend out, it's not my website so thanks BillCriswell
[06:45:51] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: I'd tell them to look up back face visibility.
[06:46:02] <BillCriswell> BarnaSzalai: Demo?
[06:46:50] <BillCriswell> gtristan: I'd paginate the table and just alter an array.
[06:47:04] <gtristan> eh, that's something we're trying to avoid at all costs
[06:47:17] <gtristan> really degraded lame UX
[06:47:42] <BillCriswell> As long as it's easily searchable you'd hopefully never need to use it.
[06:48:06] <kingfisher64> right, so something like  	    	-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */ BillCriswell
[06:48:45] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: Looks right. I am not absolutely certain though. Good would be way more helpful than me.
[06:48:47] <gtristan> it is quite searchable, and there are other cases where limiting visible results is acceptable, but these are really small records
[06:49:27] <kingfisher64> well thanks for pointing me in a direction anyway BillCriswell :)
[06:49:36] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: No problem!
[06:50:36] <gtristan> eh, anyway any method is going to work smoothly as long as it's loaded in batches - an 'insert row at this index' would just have been the correct/elegant approach
[06:52:13] <gtristan> I can just go raw JS actually: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableElement.insertRow - thats well supported on all browsers
[06:52:52] <BillCriswell> gtristan: $('table').children().eq(4).insertAfter() really wouldn't be that bad.
[06:52:59] <BillCriswell> but yeah, insertRow looks awesome.
[06:53:03] <gtristan> eh, no... that creates a row
[06:53:11] <gtristan> I need to insert one I have :-/
[06:53:22] <gtristan> I'll go with the jquery approach ;-)
[06:53:33] <gtristan> BillCriswell, thanks for the pointers anyway :D
[06:53:35] <BillCriswell> Then you can use replace()
[06:53:47] <BillCriswell> .eq(4).replace('<somerow>');
[06:54:13] <BillCriswell> or like... children().slice(3, 29).replaceWith('<somerows>')
[06:54:29] <gtristan> nod, that's not so bad
[06:54:30] <BillCriswell> I meant 'replaceWith()' on the first as well.
[06:55:14] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[06:55:39] <gtristan> probable I will do children = $(table).children() and see if I can work with that same result set to insert rows at various indices
[07:19:08] <effortDee> hi trying to do a simple jquery dialog http://pastebin.com/DGtMirfc tahts the code
[07:19:15] <effortDee> it outputs the content but not in a dialog, any reason why?
[07:19:41] <cjohnson> can we see your actual rendered output?
[07:19:42] <cjohnson> not your PHP
[07:20:03] <cjohnson> and if you wouldn't mind using a jsfiddle so it will actually be functional
[07:20:54] <effortDee> its just 3 paragraphs
[07:20:58] <effortDee> ok one min! :)
[07:22:05] <cjohnson> Oh I see what you're saying now
[07:22:09] <cjohnson> are you sure jquery ui is loaded?
[07:22:18] <cjohnson> at the time you call this code
[07:22:38] <effortDee> http://jsfiddle.net/aoz7hgex/
[07:22:40] <effortDee> yes it is
[07:22:42] <effortDee> jquery 1.6.4
[07:22:46] <effortDee> then jquery-ui
[07:22:48] <effortDee> then jquery mobile
[07:23:10] <cjohnson> oh wait and you have a syntax error
[07:23:21] <cjohnson> .dialog({modal}) is invalid
[07:23:38] <cjohnson> (open your console)
[07:23:49] <effortDee> yes
[07:24:20] <cjohnson> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-modal
[07:25:04] * effortDee looks
[07:26:17] <Jakey> hi
[07:26:27] <Jakey>  how to change an elements clas?
[07:26:39] <Jakey> using .attr()?
[07:26:49] <cjohnson> you can add a class: http://api.jquery.com/addclass/
[07:26:49] <BillCriswell> Jakey: If you want to change the whole class that can work.
[07:26:51] <Jakey> like .attr('class','domtkd')
[07:27:08] <wadie> Jakey that's how: $('.IsBestAnswer').addClass('bestanswer').removeClass('IsBestAnswer');
[07:27:22] <cjohnson> I think .prop('class', 'domtkd') would be more correct
[07:27:26] <Jakey> what about append
[07:27:26] <cjohnson> if you intend to replace all classes
[07:27:31] <cjohnson> addClass is append
[07:27:35] <Jakey> i see
[07:27:37] <Jakey> thanks
[07:27:40] <wadie> yay :D
[07:27:47] <Jakey> wadie: ?
[07:28:04] <wadie> I'm glad you know how to do it now lol
[07:29:03] <VictorCL> hi, on the draggable jqueryui , how can I set the initial position of the drag item?
[07:32:30] <Jakey> guys guys
[07:32:34] <Jakey> i'm still having this problem
[07:32:35] <Jakey> http://jsfiddle.net/38cwod2m/
[07:32:59] <Jakey> how do i select the row that has the column "header 3" have a value of 'yes'?
[07:33:12] <Jakey> $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).children().eq(2).text() === 'yes'; }).css('background','red')
[07:33:18] <Jakey> that ^ doesn't work
[07:33:38] <Jakey> $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).children().eq(2).text() === 'yes'; }).addClass('something')
[07:33:41] <Jakey> i meant
[07:33:59] <BillCriswell> Jakey: Looks right to me.
[07:34:04] <Velveeta> me too
[07:34:20] <Jakey> hmm..
[07:34:25] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/38cwod2m/4/
[07:34:28] <BillCriswell> copy and pasted your code.
[07:34:32] <Jakey> why when i inspect it doesn't add the class
[07:35:02] <Velveeta> heh, me too: http://jsfiddle.net/38cwod2m/5/
[07:35:03] <BillCriswell> Jakey: I see the class on the tr.
[07:35:29] <BillCriswell> Jakey: I imagine you just want it on the td?
[07:36:13] <Jakey> BillCriswell: no on the row <tr>
[07:36:18] <Jakey> for all the rows
[07:36:32] <BillCriswell> Oh, then something else in your code is fucking your shit up.
[07:36:33] <Jakey> wierd on the actual site doesn't work
[07:36:50] <Jakey> i'm executing this in a .on()
[07:36:58] <Jakey> for a radio button
[07:38:08] <cjohnson> that sounds like an absolute mess
[07:38:13] <cjohnson> what you're doing there :P
[07:45:57] <wa5ted> grafi: pm me when you get a chance
[07:46:02] <wa5ted> havent talked to you in a while
[07:46:42] <Jakey> cjohnson: wadie this http://jsfiddle.net/38cwod2m/6/
[07:46:47] <Jakey> but some how it works there
[07:48:07] <OnceMe> hello
[07:48:16] <OnceMe> how can I switch focus on enter from textarea to input field?
[07:49:06] <OnceMe> The thing is, I have hidden input field and textarea, so textarea is inside form and when I hit enter, textarea gets submitted, thats fine, however when I click add new place, I get unhidden input field, and I want on enter to enter new place, not textarea..
[07:49:20] <cjohnson> Jakey: my eyes :(
[07:49:33] <cjohnson> Jakey: why don't you use some sort of semantic relationship to find the node in question
[07:49:38] <cjohnson> a class or data attribute
[07:55:08] <Jakey> cjohnson: can't
[07:56:24] <cjohnson> why
[07:56:35] <Jakey> its generic
[07:56:41] <cjohnson> improve it
[07:56:54] <Jakey> no
[07:56:56] <Jakey> can't
[07:56:58] <cjohnson> why
[07:57:05] <Jakey> i don't know why its not workig
[07:57:06] <Jakey> for me
[07:57:10] <Jakey> on the real site
[07:57:14] <Jakey> it doesn' add the class
[07:57:15] <Jakey> wierd
[07:57:37] <cjohnson> because it's terrible and finnicky
[08:00:27] <Respek> I overheard the question: "Is there really no way to include page-specific javascript in the asset pipeline?" any thoughts? I figured this is the right place to ask
[08:00:36] <bbclover> Hey guys how can I trigger a click on some id?
[08:01:21] <dmrs> bbclover, $('#someid').trigger('click');
[08:01:51] <Jakey> cjohnson: is there any other filters
[08:02:12] <Jakey> or better way to select the parent <tr> thats has the <td> of value 'yes'
[08:02:20] <cjohnson> use semantic relationships
[08:02:24] <cjohnson> like a data attr or classes
[08:02:33] <cjohnson> anything else will be very fragile
[08:03:04] <cjohnson> Respek: that's certainly a question
[08:03:24] <Respek> quite
[08:03:49] <cjohnson> what are you expecting as far as thoughts?
[08:04:06] <cjohnson> sounds like somebody is suggesting to somebody else it's hard to attach page-specific JS from the way the page is constructed
[08:06:07] <Respek> workarounds, corrections, etc. It sounds like that to me as well
[08:06:23] <Respek> one answer was: "I think the only way to do anything remotely like this is to do it through a JS framework like Backbone or Ember"
[08:08:29] <cjohnson> we couldn't possibly tell you a workaround without knowing your backend ;)
[08:08:54] <cjohnson> sounds like that person is maybe just incorrect though. try asking others
[08:11:16] <Respek> not my backend. just a concept I overheard, and was curious to hear thoughts on, if there's a prevailing answer around the subject
[08:11:33] <cjohnson> whomever's backend then
[08:11:47] <cjohnson> nothing we could really give thoughts on without knowing what the backend is or why that person said that
[08:13:55] <Jakey> hey hey
[08:13:57] <Jakey> cjohnson:
[08:14:19] <Jakey> does addClass work on where an element ass a attribute class?
[08:15:41] <Jakey> cjohnson:
[08:15:50] <Jakey> and to get the attribute?
[08:16:06] <cjohnson> $foo.addClass('bar') results in $foo having class="bar"
[08:16:12] <cjohnson> in addition to any classes it had before
[08:16:29] <cjohnson> if there were none it's just class="bar"
[08:16:30] <Jakey> man why its not working
[08:16:49] <cjohnson> fragile code
[08:18:15] <Jakey> cjohnson: i even try this
[08:18:19] <Jakey> http://pastebin.com/H1E42EmW
[08:19:49] <Jakey> i meant
[08:20:00] <Jakey> i did addCLass
[08:20:03] <Jakey> but it doesn't work
[08:20:13] <Respek> cjohnson noted. I've pinged them
[08:20:15] <Respek> curious now
[08:25:35] <Jakey> cjohnson:
[08:25:49] <Jakey>     if($(this).children().eq(2).text() === 'yes')
[08:25:49] <Jakey>     {
[08:25:49] <Jakey>         $(this).html('dfd');
[08:25:50] <Jakey>     }
[08:25:54] <cjohnson> don't paste in the channel
[08:26:08] <Jakey> even if i do that
[08:26:16] <Jakey> it doesn' change the code
[08:26:24] <cjohnson> dunno what to tell you man
[08:26:39] <Jakey> cjohnson: how do i trouble shoot it DKJFLSDJFSL:DKFJSLDFJKDSf
[08:26:41] <Jakey> !!!!!
[08:27:06] <Jakey> cjohnson: somehow $(this) is not getting the element/??
[08:27:08] <Jakey> whyyYyy
[08:27:21] <Jakey> cjohnson: oh btw that table is generated dynamic too
[08:27:34] <cjohnson> right
[08:27:49] <cjohnson> you change the logic that generates it to generate classes
[08:28:01] <Jakey> cjohnson: if i do $('tr').addClass() it work
[08:28:08] <Jakey> on all the rows
[08:28:15] <Jakey> its doenstn' work on filter ones
[08:28:19] <Jakey> ecen using .each()
[08:33:07] <Germanaz0> someone knows why when you have an input text, and I'm from mobile with portrait mode, and tap on the input text, the android keyboard opens and the content is moved to the top and make it almost invisible ?
[08:35:25] <cjohnson> probably just lack of vertical resolution on the phone
[08:35:35] <cjohnson> I know what you're talking about
[08:36:12] <cjohnson> any small and the keyboard would be unusable so they just deal with it by hiding pretty much the whole window. a phone with bigger resolution / size would probably solve that
[08:37:18] <Germanaz0> that is exactly the problem cjohnson
[08:37:48] <Germanaz0> the keyboard oepn and the content is gone, you cannot see anything
[08:38:21] <cjohnson> yeah it's tough hah. I've dealt with it
[08:38:24] <cjohnson> which phone?
[08:40:00] <Germanaz0> Moto X
[08:40:11] <Germanaz0> but I want to fix for every device :X
[08:40:23] <cjohnson> ah, nope
[08:40:28] <cjohnson> highly doubt that
[08:42:49] <Germanaz0> it sucks
[08:43:20] <cjohnson> try different browsers
[08:43:24] <cjohnson> that may have impact
[08:45:25] <Jakey> hahah cjohnson
[08:45:27] <Jakey> guess
[08:45:27] <Jakey> what
[08:45:35] <Jakey> its case sensitive
[08:45:36] <Jakey> duh
[08:45:44] <Jakey> was comparing to the wrong case
[08:45:47] <Jakey> derp
[08:45:58] <Jakey> this should be a lesson for all of you guys folks
[08:46:10] <Jakey> man that eat my precoius time
[08:46:16] <tw2113> i learned something Jakey
[08:46:52] <Jakey> but haven't try it out yet
[08:47:02] <Jakey> to see if it works was too excited :P
[08:53:22] <jackjackw> how do you call one prototype method from another in js?
[09:02:15] <cjohnson> Other.prototype.foo ?
[09:02:28] <cjohnson> oh this.foo if you mean from the same prototype
[09:06:03] <cjohnson> js> ( {foo: function() { this.bar(); }, bar: function(){console.log('bar!');}} ).foo()
[09:06:10] <b-ot> cjohnson: No output.
[09:07:51] <cjohnson> oh no console I guess
[09:07:54] <cjohnson> js> ( { foo: function(){return this.bar();}, bar: function(){return 'bar';} } ).foo()
[09:07:59] <b-ot> cjohnson: No output.

[09:23:20] <zompie> Hi, is it possible to disable jquery.mobile for a special div element? I have a page where I want to use the swipe gesture. But on the same page I have a WebGL element. My problem is that the movement of the WebGL object is not correct if I load the jquery.mobile.js
[09:29:19] <robertmaxrees> did you try the data-role="nojs" thing?
[09:29:32] <robertmaxrees> or data-role="none" ?
[09:31:55] <hlvwrk> ┌( ಠ_ಠ)┘
[09:34:13] <zompie> robertmaxrees: yes I have tried both but then I can´t rotate the WebGL object anymore
[09:34:20] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[09:35:08] <benighted> anyone here know how I could change the script to expand the div based on the value= of radio selector, not the input name?
[09:35:10] <benighted> http://jsbin.com/gavapecume/1/edit
[09:35:59] <robertmaxrees> instead of what now?
[09:37:53] <robertmaxrees> benighted i'm missing something - are you trying to select something by value, instead of by name?
[09:37:55] <benighted> robertmaxrees: I have a wordpress form using contact form 7 that hides all form options and only shows divs based on what radio button 'type' is selected
[09:38:08] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be selecting on either of those.
[09:38:55] <benighted> robertmaxrees: I'm out of my depth with this, I'm open to recommendations
[09:39:58] <robertmaxrees> how do you know which group maps to which radio?
[09:40:20] <robertmaxrees> ah - the divs are the data-expand IDs
[09:40:22] <robertmaxrees> got it
[09:40:54] <benighted> I have updated to simplify, I want the designer option to show if kitchen is selected and door type if door is selected http://jsbin.com/gavapecume/1/edit
[09:41:06] <robertmaxrees> i see exactly what you're trying to do.
[09:42:17] <benighted> robertmaxrees: I"ve got it working, but I'm limited in what I can use in email output within contact form 7. If I use the shortcode [type], instead of "kitchen" I get "on"
[09:42:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to fix this up for you.
[09:42:36] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:42:48] <robertmaxrees> well, the JS at least.
[09:43:07] <benighted> robertmaxrees: sure thing, I can handle html and css no prob
[09:43:22] <robertmaxrees> there's actually stuff you're not doing in your CSS that you should be ;)
[09:43:23] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:43:37] <benighted> display: none?
[09:43:51] <benighted> robertmaxrees: right... one sec lol
[09:45:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9yuhmre/2/
[09:45:23] <robertmaxrees> do something like this instead.
[09:47:21] * keady__ waves
[09:47:38] <kevin> hows it going
[09:48:21] <robertmaxrees> this storn in norcal is insane
[09:49:47] <benighted> robertmaxrees: ah, very good... except needed to change class=type to name=type so radio selection is exclusive, and updated js. Looks like this just might work!
[09:49:57] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[09:50:15] <benighted> robertmaxrees: ah, k
[09:50:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9yuhmre/3/
[09:50:38] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[09:51:17] <robertmaxrees> avoid selecting on things that aren't IDs or Names.
[09:52:13] <benighted> got it... I'm going to test it out, standby
[09:52:30] <robertmaxrees> you might need to modify your markup.
[09:53:09] <benighted> I caught the div class additions and labels to input, anything else?
[09:53:32] <robertmaxrees> not entirely sure wha3t else you needed fixed.
[10:03:43] <benighted> robertmaxrees: works well, only exception is it doesn't hide expandables by default
[10:03:56] <robertmaxrees> benighted that's why you give them that .hide class
[10:04:05] <robertmaxrees> don't control stuff like that through JS
[10:05:05] <paulvd> helllooo, in google maps the location is centered, is there any way i can move the location to the left of the map, so the part that is centered is to the right of the location ?

[10:14:10] <ngharo> are JSONP requests from an HTTPS page to an HTTP resource not permitted?  Chrome is blocking those from happening.
[10:14:35] <robertmaxrees> JSONP can be impacted by CORS as well ;)
[10:14:39] <robertmaxrees> make sure the sending server allows it.
[10:15:16] <ngharo> sending server? what does the server hosting the script have to do with it?
[10:15:47] <robertmaxrees> the server you're calling the data from.
[10:21:14] <ngharo> i have all the Access-Control headers setup
[10:21:18] <ngharo> works from jsfiddle
[10:21:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the error you're getting then?
[10:21:24] <ngharo> fails on my https site
[10:22:13] <ngharo> The page at 'http://foo.bar' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://192.168.75.1/BackupPC/testpoint?callback=jQuery111105083278906531632_1418321990172&_=1418321990173'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[10:22:34] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, you're on HTTPS requesting from HTTP.  must've misread that.
[10:22:38] <robertmaxrees> no real way around that.
[10:23:06] <hlvwrk> ┌( ಠ_ಠ)┘
[10:23:15] <ngharo> dang
[10:23:24] <cjohnson> can you add https to the other server?
[10:23:28] <hlvwrk> of course not
[10:23:40] <cjohnson> maybe it already provides it?
[10:23:43] <cjohnson> or have you tried
[10:23:55] <ngharo> yeah not really, i mean it'll be fail SSL as i access this machine by IP
[10:24:08] <hlvwrk> ngharo, why not make the link '//' instead of placing http, or https in front of the link?
[10:24:22] <benighted> robertmaxrees: massive thanks, closing my project today
[10:24:23] <ngharo> it's a resource behind a VPN and i want to programatically tell if the client can reach it or not from my web app
[10:24:28] <cjohnson> hlvwrk: that only works if the other end provides the same link via https
[10:24:49] <hlvwrk> well right but atleast that way you don't have to do any guessing
[10:24:53] <ngharo> maybe i can do some hack with loading an <img> an watch for load event
[10:24:56] <robertmaxrees> benighted of course :)
[10:25:05] <robertmaxrees> ngharo that'll have the same problem.
[10:25:11] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to load insecure content into a secure page.
[10:25:14] <hlvwrk> ^
[10:25:21] <ngharo> oh yeah, shit
[10:25:37] <robertmaxrees> proxy to a page on your side.
[10:25:38] <ngharo> welp, wait won't chrome just "yellow bar" the page then
[10:25:42] <robertmaxrees> oh wait you can't.
[10:25:51] <robertmaxrees> are you only worried about chrome?
[10:26:00] <ngharo> chrome and firefox really
[10:26:11] <robertmaxrees> could test it, but you're always going to have some kind of funk with it.
[10:28:48] <ngharo> chrome loads the image, firefox doesn't
[10:29:17] <ngharo> man this sucks. lol maybe i'll just axe this feature or just a warning followed by a redirect
[10:29:25] <ngharo> that may or may not succeed
[10:29:30] <robertmaxrees> what exactly are you building?
[10:31:52] <ngharo> i want to display a link to an external backup webui (that's behind a VPN) if the backup server is network reachable by the user
[10:34:10] <ngharo> to simplify further: i want to tell if an external HTTP resource is reachable (from HTTPS).
[10:34:19] <robertmaxrees> aye - not really doable.
[10:34:46] <jakery> you could host a JS file somewhere at the resource that emits some sort of event if it is successfully loaded
[10:35:02] <robertmaxrees> jakery still trying to load insecure onto secure.
[10:35:05] <robertmaxrees> that's the core problem.
[10:35:09] <ngharo> jakery: yeah tried something like that. firefox wont load mixed content
[10:35:52] <jakery> firefox has been known for their puritanism
[10:36:21] <robertmaxrees> and chrome has been known for having the majority of fixes in jquery core ;)
[10:37:09] <jakery> what do you mean won't load mixed though? It doesn't accept it as a <script src="url.to.triggerscript"> ?
[10:37:23] <robertmaxrees> jakery he's on an HTTPS page.
[10:37:28] <robertmaxrees> you can't load content hosted on HTTP
[10:37:44] <ngharo> jakery: server has Strict-Transport-Security response header.  might have something to do with it
[10:37:58] <jakery> oh
[10:38:10] <robertmaxrees> the browser also doesn't like doing that, ngharo
[10:40:36] <ngharo> here i was championing JSONP to the other developer to solve this problem.  lol didn't consider the extra HTTPS stuff getting in the way :)
[10:40:43] <ngharo> thx for input ya'll

[11:08:31] <kegster> how can i get an image to flip across the Y axis visually? i dont care to have an effect. just want a "mirror" button that flips the image... no effect preferred but don't care
[11:08:35] <kegster> everything i see is a flip "effect"
[11:10:08] <decx> transform: scale(1,-1)
[11:13:59] <kegster> has to be css only?
[11:14:13] <kegster> i suppose so
[11:14:16] <kegster> makes sense
[11:21:12] <decx> well you could use canvas to flip and export a base64 string and switch your source with that, but that would be ridiculous
[12:02:49] <MikeD_> the the iteration order of $.each() follow the array index of the array (guaranteed) ?
[12:07:37] <cjohnson> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/59232825aa87b941dd2418a6860b64017dfec0ae/src/core.js#L279
[12:08:11] <cjohnson> looks like it generally breaks down to standard for or for...in iteration
[12:14:34] <MikeD_> neat, I didn't think to look at implementation - just assumed don't look under the covers
[12:18:39] <ohaibbq> MikeD_, i think generally thats a bad way to think about jquery :)
[12:21:49] <phelix> I'm using jquery to toggleCLass on hover. I have added transition css to the 2 different classes I am trying to toggle. The transition effect works on Chrome but not FF.. is this a css question you think? Or anyone know a work around?
[12:22:41] <Oka> phelix: Make a test case, but you're probably missing vendor prefixes.
[12:25:00] <buharin> hello how to iterate over json data
[12:25:07] <buharin> I used
[12:25:22] <buharin> $(data.result).each(function(value) {
[12:25:26] <buharin> and get an error
[12:25:31] <buharin> unrecognized expression: ["task1", "task2"]
[12:26:46] <phelix> Oka: http://jsfiddle.net/yncck32n/4/
[12:29:57] <cjohnson> buharin: jsfiddle your code w/data please
[12:31:54] <buharin> cjohnson, {"result": "[\"task1\", \"task2\"]"}
[12:32:03] <buharin> cjohnson, sry it is from firebug
[12:32:13] <buharin> 	"["task1", "task2"]"
[12:32:47] <cjohnson> that's invalid either way you have it there. why are you putting quotes around the array?
[12:32:59] <buharin> cjohnson, I didnt
[12:33:03] <buharin> $.each(data.result, function( index, value )
[12:33:06] <buharin> if I do like that
[12:33:09] <buharin> I get error
[12:33:15] <cjohnson> the each is not your issue
[12:33:16] <buharin> TypeError: invalid 'in' operand a
[12:33:22] <cjohnson> the error is happening when it's trying to parse your JSON
[12:33:30] <cjohnson> that's why it says "unrecognized expression"
[12:33:31] <buharin> cjohnson, mmm
[12:33:42] <buharin> I used json.dump python function on list
[12:33:52] <cjohnson> both lines of JSON you pasted in here are invalid as they stand
[12:34:10] <cjohnson> I don't get why you're wrapping ["task1", "task2"] in quotes
[12:34:28] <buharin> cjohnson, thats not me
[12:34:39] <cjohnson> well whoever is generating the JSON
[12:34:42] <cjohnson> is making invalid JSON
[12:34:58] <kingfisher64> could somebody help me write a fade in text onhover of a image? The image which appears onhover is by using css transitions (nth child). I'm having to put scripts into qjuery no conflict mode. This is my jquery file so far which is a fade in on a flexslider image http://pastebin.com/BpNFPPhE
[12:35:00] <buharin> cjohnson, >>> json.dumps(s)
[12:35:00] <buharin> '["task1", "task2"]'
[12:35:08] <buharin> python wrap it
[12:35:09] <buharin> : (
[12:35:59] <cjohnson> looks like you're double-converting the object structure to JSON
[12:36:04] <kingfisher64> it's a field called .views-field-body that i'm wanting hidden until the user scrolls over the hovered image (not my idea to make it this complicated)
[12:37:42] <kingfisher64> i can provide the url if that will clarify what i'm after. It's v simple for someone skilled in jquery. I'm taking time out this christmas to learn an awful lot more needed. Many thanks
[12:37:53] <buharin> cjohnson, mmm idk why python do this
[12:38:22] <cjohnson> python does what you tell it to do
[12:38:48] <buharin> cjohnson, how can I convert string array to properly json file?
[12:39:19] <cjohnson> that'd be a python question, not really for this channel. I'm not familiar
[12:39:21] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: Mmm, drupal.
[12:40:30] <kingfisher64> i love drupal BillCriswell and i'm not a dev, it's so flexible.
[12:40:46] <kingfisher64> unfortunatly my jquery skills are not upto scratch
[12:41:35] <kingfisher64> do you not like drupal BillCriswell?
[12:43:51] <kingfisher64> that pastebin is just what i've got at the moment, fading text in on a flexslider slide. I need something similar but on an image hover - so simple - if you know the code
[12:47:10] <kingfisher64> would anyone be kind enough to offer some advice? this is the last job on this site and it's driving me nuts!
[12:47:23] <kingfisher64> even more nuts, i started off nuts.
[12:47:55] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: I don't like it at all, but I also don't know it very well.
[12:48:42] <BillCriswell> Even though I've worked with it every day for a year now.
[12:48:47] <kingfisher64> aagh, I'm not a developer or designer somewhere in between a builder if you will but compared to joomla, wordpress it's heaven
[12:49:03] <kingfisher64> i hate them
[12:50:24] <kingfisher64> i'm after something v similar to http://jsfiddle.net/SBpzX/2/
[12:50:56] <kingfisher64> just not sure how to adapt ^^^ into http://pastebin.com/BpNFPPhE
[12:53:22] <kingfisher64> okay I don't want the flashing text just onhover it fades in some text. The funcationlity  I've been asked to replicate is http://www.limewoodhotel.co.uk/home/
[12:54:25] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: I'd just use css here.
[12:54:43] <kingfisher64> what transitions? BillCriswell
[12:54:55] <BillCriswell> opacity
[12:55:21] <BillCriswell> img:hover .overlay { opacity: .5 }ish
[12:55:27] <kingfisher64> it needs to be onhover of the image (field) though show the body text
[12:55:44] <BillCriswell> Er, .container:hover .overlay { opacity: .5; }ish *
[12:57:41] <kingfisher64> can i pm you the address BillCriswell since it's not qjuery related. So you know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm sure i'll end up going with your solution it sounds nice but there is an added complication. it's already got onhover show nth child
[12:59:21] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: http://jsbin.com/zelobaliwu/1/edit?html,css,output something like this.
[12:59:26] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: Sure. I'll take a look.
[13:36:30] <slide> So I have a popup using jQuery-UIs dialog and I've tried to disable all ways the user could close it without actually submitting however we have a few that are. I'm trying to figure out why, I was thinking of saving maybe the Modernizr info and browser string to the server so i can analyze it after the fact. Anyone have any advice?
[13:37:43] <robertmaxrees> what's the dialog for?
[13:37:57] <slide> a questionnaire
[13:38:13] <slide> which you must answer all the questions until the submit button is enabled
[13:38:27] <robertmaxrees> is it popping over an article or something?
[13:38:43] <robertmaxrees> something tells me users and removing them via their dev tools.
[13:38:45] <slide> no, it is a user portal
[13:39:05] <robertmaxrees> figure out the user and ask 'em i guess?
[13:39:16] <slide> nah, i seriously doubt 6% of people know how to do that (out of about 40k)
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> sometimes users show other users how to do that.
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> could store all keystrokes and ship those to the server as well.
[13:40:05] <slide> yea
[13:40:17] <robertmaxrees> but you might have more luck finding out who and just asking the,.
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> *them.
[13:40:40] <slide> easier said than done
[13:40:57] <robertmaxrees> you asked for advice/ideas ;)
[13:41:38] <slide> yes i did, thanks :)
[13:41:55] <slide> i'm surprised something to save this data doesn't exist already
[13:44:08] <robertmaxrees> they exist.
[13:44:21] <robertmaxrees> you want a RUM setup.
[13:44:31] <robertmaxrees> we use New Relic at my current place.
[13:44:53] <robertmaxrees> you can setup custom errors and messages to emit into the system to tell you all sorts of things about the request.
[13:45:48] <reynierpm> hi there, why in this context http://jsbin.com/lupoqu/1/edit?js,output if I check one chekbox the one at thead the rest of them get checked too? the idea is to check the one at top and check the rest of them on the table but not all of them, any advice? what is wrong in my code
[13:47:45] <robertmaxrees> $('input').prop('checked', $(this).prop('checked'));
[13:48:06] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes, that only happens on the container? right?
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> this is looking for every input and setting its "checked" property to whatever the title checkbox.
[13:48:23] <robertmaxrees> nope. $('input') selects every input on the page.
[13:48:44] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees and how do I restrict only to it´s container?
[13:48:53] <robertmaxrees> the same way you would with CSS>
[13:49:29] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees not follow you, what you mean with ¨the same way you would with CSS¨?
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> how would you select all inputs that are inside the container #resultadoNorma ?
[13:50:37] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees by finding them using .find() and set .prop(´checked true)?
[13:50:40] <Stalkr_> Using $.ajax, if I am making a GET to a 404, shouldn't my error: get triggered instead of throwing an error in the log?
[13:51:12] <Stalkr_> I want to disable a select element if it's a 404, so I was thinking about using error: for that
[13:51:59] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees $("#resultadoNorma").find('input[type="checkbox"]').prop(´checked´, true), that way?
[13:52:12] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm that's one way.
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> you could also just do $('#resultadoNorma input')
[13:52:43] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees could you setup a very basic example?
[13:52:56] <robertmaxrees> $('#resultadoNorma input').prop('checked', $(this).prop('checked')); use this instead yo.
[13:53:02] <robertmaxrees> literally that simple.
[13:53:23] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok, fine, but this will goes inside the change event right?
[13:53:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> where else would it go?
[13:53:44] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees jejejeje sure ;)
[13:54:31] <robertmaxrees> ah you're the dude who was concerned with being DRY
[13:55:16] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes, the same, and having a lot of issues trying to apply that code on different parts of my code
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> it's because you're tying your logic to your data too closely.
[13:56:15] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees is the only way I get it for now my knowledge is not so advanced
[13:56:48] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees but nevermind those headaches will make me learn and study a lot and that is the advantage
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm get used to using things like .closest() .find() off the `this` object
[14:05:56] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees on it, this is my first time with a big project with amount of frontend
[14:27:36] <Zzaichik> Chlorophyll?! More like bore-o-phyll
[14:27:47] <NoiseEee> ./rimshot
[15:09:12] <b0t> Helloo i need help with match
[15:11:39] <b0t> $('body).match((/youtube/g) {
[15:11:40] <b0t> $(this).html( '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="' + $(this).html().replace(/https?\:/, '').replace(/watch\?v=/, 'embed/') + '" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen"></iframe>' );
[15:11:40] <b0t> });
[15:14:45] <robertmaxrees> b0t there's no jquery match method.
[15:15:48] <b0t> Http://pastie.org/9775146
[15:16:04] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't make any sense.
[15:16:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[15:16:56] <b0t> I need match "youtube" in the body
[15:17:01] <robertmaxrees> match youtube what?
[15:17:02] <robertmaxrees> text?
[15:17:07] <b0t> Yes
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not a very good idea.
[15:17:16] <b0t> And convert the text in a link
[15:17:21] <b0t> Sorry iframe
[15:17:28] <robertmaxrees> do you have an element you can target instead?
[15:17:32] <b0t> Www.youtube.com
[15:17:36] <b0t> Is a forum
[15:17:50] <robertmaxrees> because searching through the entire page for the text "youtube" is very slow.
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> and not a very good idea.
[15:17:56] <b0t> Match in #post
[15:18:05] <robertmaxrees> so there's only one post?
[15:18:15] <robertmaxrees> share some example HTML.
[15:18:41] <b0t> I work in localhost
[15:18:43] <b0t> My pc
[15:18:48] <b0t> In the div #post
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> i just need an example.
[15:19:02] <b0t> What example?
[15:19:03] <robertmaxrees> not the whole thing.
[15:19:07] <robertmaxrees> of the HTML you're working with.
[15:19:13] <b0t> What???
[15:19:30] <b0t> Bla bla bla bla youtube.com bla bla bla
[15:19:35] <b0t> What example men?
[15:19:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:19:47] <robertmaxrees> what does the html look like that you're working with?
[15:19:58] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees is me again see this code http://jsbin.com/yorere/1/edit?js,output why if I check the top checkbox the tr´s inside #resultadoNormaBody not get copyMe class?
[15:20:10] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're trying to find all occurrances of some text in a document and that's very slow, b0t
[15:21:55] <b0t> Ok
[15:21:59] <b0t> Check my example
[15:22:00] <b0t> Http://pastie.org/9775160
[15:22:02] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees is not my code checking if top chk is checked and if it is find then all the tr inside #resultadoNormaBody and add class copyMe
[15:22:04] <reynierpm> ?
[15:22:13] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm slow down buddy
[15:22:22] <b0t> reynierpm::: Hablas espaol?
[15:22:38] <tapout> if i have ;   class="bingo bango" ...    $(".bango).val() is always undefined,  I suspect it's not finding the class, am I searching properly
[15:22:54] <reynierpm> b0t si
[15:23:12] <b0t> Ok fijate si entendiste lo q pedi, este pide demasiada info
[15:23:45] <Robdgreat> tapout: $('.bango') unless I'm mistaken returns an array, not a jquery object. use an id or do $('.bango').first().val()
[15:24:04] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat $() that returns an array like object.
[15:24:07] <reynierpm> es q no vi la conversacion completa entre tu y el
[15:24:18] <reynierpm> b0t no te puedo decir mucho
[15:24:45] <Robdgreat> *array or array equivalent :P
[15:24:52] <robertmaxrees> "array-like"
[15:24:59] <robertmaxrees> there's an important distinction :)
[15:25:10] <Robdgreat> a (*&(*#%##@%^@#$^ iterable
[15:25:13] <Robdgreat> >.>
[15:25:18] <robertmaxrees> tapout if there's only one .bango, .val() gets the first one.
[15:25:29] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the text from an element?
[15:25:38] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm you had ##toggleCheckboxNormaModal
[15:25:44] <robertmaxrees> swap that to #toggleCheckboxNormaModal
[15:26:23] <robertmaxrees> b0t don't search through all text to replace youtube links like that.
[15:26:40] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees upppssss that tiny error when you are looking for a big one, thanks fixing that make code works
[15:26:44] <robertmaxrees> if you need something like that, use your backend to parse those out and at least wrap them in a class or something.
[15:26:50] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm deffo
[15:26:58] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees btw any suggestion you will do it for improve my code?
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't need an each for allTbodyTr for those addClass/removeClass calls.
[15:28:02] <robertmaxrees> store things in variables instead of selecting a whole bunch.
[15:28:32] <tapout> so $(".bango")[0] <-- I have a <a href = ....>   how can I find the 'url'?
[15:28:48] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees not follow you at all but thanks will count for next coding
[15:28:51] <robertmaxrees> tapout huh?
[15:29:03] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm allTbodyTr.addClass('copyMe')
[15:29:04] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees as said earlier has a lot to learn yet
[15:29:07] <robertmaxrees> instead of the .each()
[15:29:12] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the .each()
[15:29:19] <tapout> maybe $(".bango")[0].attr('href');
[15:29:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:29:24] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ahhh that one is new for me
[15:29:41] <robertmaxrees> tapout why are you doing [0]?
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> if you do $(".bango").prop('href') or $(".bango").attr('href'), you'll get what you want.
[15:30:05] <tapout> because i have 10 finds
[15:30:16] <tapout> i have 10 different classes that match
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> both of those return the href of the first thing in the set.
[15:30:19] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[15:30:47] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/prop/ -> "Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements..."
[15:31:00] <tapout> what i'm trying to do, for each select box, i want to find the corresponding url ,  so i somehow have to track the selections and find the appropriate url
[15:31:01] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to try to get the first element - it does it for you.
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> then you want .each()
[15:31:32] <robertmaxrees> $('bango').each(function() { console.log(this.href) });
[15:32:19] <tapout> lets say you have 2 select boxes.  You have 2 urls.  selectbox 1, when it's changed.. how would you "link" the selectbox to the url?  I'm thinking of putting a custom class on each url ..  link1  .. link2, ... link3 .. I dunno what the best approach is
[15:32:20] <tapout> trying that
[15:32:36] <robertmaxrees> can you share an approximation of your html?
[15:33:13] <tapout> sec
[15:37:27] <robertmaxrees> btw i gotta head out soon.
[15:37:59] <b0t> My code??????????????
[15:38:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry i just dropped
[15:38:06] <b0t> My helppp
[15:38:07] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[15:38:22] <robertmaxrees> i just told you that you need to not do what you're doing with js/jquery, b0t
[15:38:24] <b0t> Youtube.com = match....
[15:38:48] <robertmaxrees> don't do that with javascript.
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a very bad idea.
[15:38:51] <b0t> Ahhh
[15:38:55] <b0t> Ok
[15:39:00] <b0t> Tell my other idea
[15:39:04] <robertmaxrees> have your backend do it.
[15:41:13] <robertmaxrees> alright, enjoy folks.
[15:41:30] <b0t> You must help me with jquery,in other I got it
[15:44:23] <tapout> dammit, he left
[15:44:31] <tapout> http://5.9.74.118/test.html
[15:46:27] <tapout> if you have multiple select's ..  and do .change, is there a way to tell which select fired?
[15:46:29] <tapout> like, the index?
[15:51:36] <cjohnson> "this" is the select element
[15:53:22] <tapout> cjohnson, can you look at my sample ?
[15:53:27] <tapout> see if you can give me a tip/direction?
[15:53:45] <cjohnson> which part are you stuck on?
[15:53:51] <cjohnson> this is the select inside your event listener
[15:54:12] <tapout> when someone changes the select box, i want the url to update ONLY for the button to the right..
[15:54:34] <tapout> so i was thinking,  select index 0, find publish with index 0, and then change the url that way
[15:54:53] <cjohnson> nope, you want to make it relative to the select
[15:54:56] <cjohnson> (which is "this")
[15:55:02] <cjohnson> so for example
[15:55:15] <cjohnson> this.closest('tr')  will give you the parent <tr> of the select that emitted the change event
[15:55:27] <cjohnson> and from there you can use .find or anything else
[15:55:31] <tapout> ahh!
[15:55:33] <tapout> ahh ahh!
[15:55:50] <tapout> thank you, that's a great tip!
[15:56:09] <cjohnson> :)
[15:58:55] <tapout> does closest always go up ?
[15:58:59] <tapout> it must eh
[15:59:09] <tapout> oh the tree will always find tr properly, nevermind
[16:02:23] <tapout> why can't i do; console.log(this.closest('tr'));
[16:04:38] <tapout> in the console log, i get :  Uncaught typeerror: undefined is not a function
[16:06:57] <cjohnson> this is an HTMLElement
[16:06:59] <cjohnson> not a jquery object
[16:07:09] <cjohnson> my mistake
[16:07:12] <cjohnson> $(this).closest('tr')
[16:07:21] <cjohnson> and yes, closest always travels up
[16:09:08] <tapout> ahh there we go! lol
[16:09:09] <tapout> mybad
[16:09:16] <tapout> thanks man
[16:09:33] <cjohnson> np
[16:12:34] <tapout> cjohnson, okay now once I find the url, is there a way I can break it up?  or a way to say ...   replace('sel=123')
[16:12:37] <tapout> overwrite what was there
[16:13:42] <cjohnson> you're on the right path
[16:13:55] <cjohnson> .replace(/sel=123/i, 'sel=456')
[16:13:56] <cjohnson> or so
[16:14:24] <cjohnson> I think this is backward though
[16:14:39] <cjohnson> instead, I would put onclick on the link tag, and at the time it's clicked, that's when you read the select's value
[16:14:42] <cjohnson> and build the URL from that
[16:14:55] <cjohnson> instead of changing the a.href from the input onchange
[16:14:58] <cjohnson> select onchange*
[16:15:15] <tapout> is there a way to itemize the args?
[16:15:30] <cjohnson> nothing built into JS
[16:15:36] <cjohnson> I don't think jquery has anything else
[16:15:54] <cjohnson> but still... construct it in the onclick and you don't need to be doing any replacing
[16:16:00] <cjohnson> which is better
[16:16:15] <tapout> it's already there, if someone optionally adds a selector it modifies the url
[16:16:33] <cjohnson> right, seems backward to me
[16:17:17] <cjohnson> .on('click', function() { var selectVal = $(this).closest('tr').find('select').val(); location.href = '/some/page?filter=' + selectVal; return false; })
[16:17:18] <tapout> i didn't wanna change the whole backend to match up to this new method, so i thought i would just add the select boxes, and change the url
[16:17:29] <cjohnson> you wouldn't be changing any backend
[16:18:18] <cjohnson> as you'll find out, select doesn't always trigger the .change event when you change its value. sometimes only once you defocus the element
[16:18:21] <tapout> on click is better than .change
[16:18:42] <tapout> ahh i see
[16:37:44] <tapout> why does jquery docs not show '.replace' ?
[16:39:05] <jikuja> tapout: are you referring to javascript's String method replace() or something else?
[16:43:00] <tapout> oh it's javascripts! lol
[16:43:04] <systemfault> Because it doesn't exists?
[16:47:48] <systemfault> You win
[16:56:31] <tapout> so I did $(this).closest('tr').find('.mylink').attr('href').replace(/sel=\d+/,'sel=123');   What i notice tho, is if i hover over the link, the new value isn't saved.. why is that?
[17:00:42] <tapout> ahh, i gotta   .attr('href',newval)
[17:01:31] <jikuja> yeah. With 1 arg it's getter with 2 argh setter
[17:20:39] <jiffe> so I have a jqplot that I destroy and recreate once a minute, if that page is open in a tab that isn't focused for a while when I go back to that tab it takes a while for that page to show, does that sound right?
[17:24:42] <tapout> I have a multi-select window, if I do... one at a time, on click fires, but if i hold down the left mouse button and highlight them all, it doesn't fire, why is that?
[17:27:29] <robertmaxrees> tapout usually you want change, not click.
[17:27:45] <tapout> someone said to use on click earlier, okay i will do that
[17:28:22] <robertmaxrees> it'll fire when you raise the mouse button
[17:29:24] <tapout> "as you'll find out, select doesn't always trigger the .change event when you change its value. sometimes only once you defocus the element"
[17:29:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qkj32165/
[17:30:50] <tapout> i changed it to .changed and it worked flawlessly, thanks.. but i worry about the scenario where .change doesn't fire once you change it's value, have you ever experienced that?
[17:31:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:31:23] <blackhajime> hello
[17:31:37] <robertmaxrees> where are you reading that it doesn't fire, tapout?
[17:31:46] <blackhajime> someone help me
[17:31:52] <robertmaxrees> !asl @ blackhajime
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:32:00] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ blackhajime
[17:32:00] <b-ot> blackhajime: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:32:09] <blackhajime> http://dpaste.com/3FAZG63 .. its bring me to "too much recursion"
[17:32:15] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: thanks
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> blackhajime on what line?'
[17:33:02] <tapout> someone said it earlier, no biggie.. it works
[17:33:09] <robertmaxrees> tapout interesting.
[17:33:15] <robertmaxrees> tapout fair enough.
[17:33:33] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: i want to validate before goes to validate next step ...
[17:33:59] <robertmaxrees> blackhajime okay - are you getting any line numbers with the error?
[17:34:15] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise i'll need you to setup an actual example.
[17:34:32] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: i dont know what line bring me to this error ...
[17:35:28] <robertmaxrees> it seems unusual that you're calling .bootstrapWizard)_  from inside of another .bootstrapWizard()
[17:35:31] <robertmaxrees> *()
[17:36:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to have each "step" setup as its down, unique form, and validate each one separately.
[17:36:20] <robertmaxrees> that's just a guess, though.  might have more luck in the boostrap channel.
[17:37:06] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: thanks .. i'm not a jquery or js expert....
[17:37:33] <robertmaxrees> blackhajime not saying you need to be :) very difficult to help you though.
[17:37:41] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: which line, i should analyze ... 54 .. 79
[17:37:54] <robertmaxrees> blackhajime i don't know.
[17:38:28] <robertmaxrees> blackhajime without seeing this setup in a functioning example, I wouldn't have any way of knowing, but it looks like you're trying to initialize something where you shouldn't.
[17:38:46] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: any tool to verbose the output ? i'm in firefox browser
[17:38:56] <robertmaxrees> look at your console.
[17:38:59] <robertmaxrees> in the developer tools.
[17:39:56] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ also check out this guide.
[17:40:55] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: if i remove "bootstrapValidator({
[17:40:57] <blackhajime>             fields: { ...." parts .. the click next button was functioning properly, ..
[17:41:12] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: but, validation was not working ...
[17:41:25] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're trying to initialize it twice.
[17:43:10] <blackhajime> robertmaxrees: i'm not understand... sorry for my lol :(
[17:43:22] <robertmaxrees> what aren't you understanding?
[17:43:44] <blackhajime> "you're trying to initialize it twice" part
[17:44:11] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the site I linked you?
[17:44:21] <blackhajime> going to there
[17:44:40] <robertmaxrees> check that out - if you're still lost, go to the bootstrap channel and talk to them about it.
[17:46:05] <blackhajime> i'm on #bootstrap too... but, it seem the people was busy ..
[17:46:41] <robertmaxrees> just be patient.
[19:15:18] <AcidRain2012> facebook is so poorly organized that it gives me a headache to look at it while high
[19:16:06] <genaside> anyone had a problem with jquery mobile in capturing keyevent 13(enter key)? all the keys report events except the enterkey.
[19:17:44] <genaside> $(document).on("keypress", '#search-input', function(event) { alert(event.keycode); });
[19:18:09] <genaside> iam using jquery mobile version 1.4
[19:18:58] <shebbi> AcidRain2012: Probably not Facebook. More to do with your permanent brain damage from being high :P
[19:19:51] <AcidRain2012> i do believe too much bud in my brain is causing brain damage. and 7yrs ago i would have totally disagreed. but today, ye. its true
[19:20:05] <AcidRain2012> i wrote some jquery ealier.
[19:20:15] <AcidRain2012> and took me 4 hrs to find out why an event wasnt firing
[19:20:22] <AcidRain2012> turns out i had never linked the file :/
[19:46:54] <ApplesInArrays> any disadvantage to using 2.1 vs 1.3?
[20:14:40] <shebbi> AcidRain2012: Recent study has shown that long term use of "bud" causing your brain to shrink :)
[20:48:25] <genaside> why is life so hard
[21:09:32] <gtristan> ok what am I missing :-/
[21:09:53] <gtristan> if I want to add 'row' to 'table' at position 25
[21:10:16] <gtristan> I can do $(table).children().eq(25).before(row);
[21:10:19] <gtristan> correct ?
[21:10:35] <gtristan> or wait... it only works if there *is* a row currently at position 25
[21:10:47] <gtristan> I guess that would make sense
[21:21:57] <boxxa> can someone help me understand why i am having such a hard time with selecting a input textbox value in a table
[21:22:26] <boxxa> basically tr has a ID, the td that has the input has class .mapweight and the input inside of it i want the value of. keep getting undefined
[21:23:29] <boxxa> $('#tableID tr#rowID td.mapweight input.mapweightinput has val() being undefined
[21:28:53] <AcidRain2012> boxxa
[21:29:00] <AcidRain2012> eh. he left
[21:43:24] <gtristan> so strange
[21:44:05] <gtristan> when adding rows at specific positions in a table, I get incorrect results depending on the jquery API I use
[21:44:58] <gtristan> for instance, $(this.loadedRows[index].node).before (row.node) - that breaks and inserts at the wrong place
[21:45:18] <gtristan> $(this.loadedRows[index - 1].node).after (row.node) - that works well
[21:46:03] <gtristan> I've also found that, when populating or sorting the table initially, the first row should be $(container).prepend (node), and after that, $(sibling).after (node)
[21:46:38] <gtristan> simply using $(container).append() causes me to lose all style on the added nodes
[21:46:58] <gtristan> is there a reason for this kind of behavior, some known issue ?
[22:39:16] <gtristan> hmmm, is there a way to collect a hand full of nodes and add them to a jquery object ?
[22:39:56] <gtristan> .add() I presume ?
[22:40:45] <Jattenalle> everything = $(oldthing).add(newthing);
[22:40:47] <Jattenalle> gtristan,
[22:40:59] <gtristan> Jattenalle, thanks
[22:41:14] <Jattenalle> newthing can be pretty much anything you want, raw htm, selector, nodes, elements, selectors.. etc
[22:41:16] <Jattenalle> it's neat
[22:41:28] <gtristan> Jattenalle, then I can just do everything.add (anotherThing) ?
[22:41:42] <gtristan> or I need to do everything = everything.add (another) ?
[22:41:44] <Jattenalle> no
[22:41:45] <Jattenalle> yeah
[22:41:48] <gtristan> :)
[22:41:49] <gtristan> I got it
[22:41:55] <Jattenalle> everything = soemthing.add(otherthing);
[22:42:28] <gtristan> I'm in a loop, collecting the rows I need to remove from a table
[22:43:10] <gtristan> so toDetach = null; ... in loop: if (!toDetach) toDetach = $(node) else toDetach = toDetach.add ($(node))
[22:49:48] <reynierpm> hi there how in this script http://jsbin.com/buveze/1/edit?js,output I can access tabsActive var for example in this line select2("enable", tabsActive.wzSolicitud[0]);?
[22:56:24] <gtristan> strange
[22:56:29] <gtristan> really strange
[22:56:53] <gtristan> So I have a table from which I need to remove around 1000 rows
[22:57:43] <gtristan> and the loop which does $(rowNode).detach(); for each and every row... runs FASTER than calling $(toDetach).detach(); ONCE on the batch of rows which need detaching !
[22:58:10] <gtristan> makes no sense :-S
[22:58:55] <gtristan> maybe the 'creating a jquery object' is more expensive
[22:59:02] <gtristan> with .add()
[22:59:23] <gtristan> Can I create a jquery object *once* from a JS Array of element nodes ?
[23:18:02] <gtristan> well, I can add a bunch of nodes to an array and call $(array).detach(), that doesnt /degrade/ performance per se, but oddly, it does not significantly improve it either
[23:18:28] <gtristan> I have a probably 10ms gain on 400 when removing only ~1000 rows :-/
[23:19:13] <gtristan> something is probably wrong, either the single reflow is really costing 400ms, or jquery is causing multiple reflows for a single call to .detach()
[23:32:24] <sacho_> gtristan, jquery can't cause multiple reflows for a single synchronous call
[23:32:40] <sacho_> have you tried chrome's profiler to figure out what's slowing you down?
[23:33:00] <gtristan> sacho_, not sure how to use it ;-)
[23:33:01] <gtristan> hehe
[23:33:10] * gtristan looks in the dev tools
[23:33:44] <sacho_> well, you could start with the timeline
[23:34:19] <sacho_> start the timeline recorder, do (whatever is slow), then inspect it in the timeline
[23:34:28] <gtristan> start/stop profiling during a filtering of the list... shows most time is spent in removeChild()
[23:35:48] <gtristan> sacho_, this article suggests removing parent element temporarily: https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/javascript-dom
[23:35:57] <gtristan> seems worth a try
[23:36:42] <gtristan> also I looked at this article: http://www.dotnetcurry.com/showarticle.aspx?ID=956, but it makes an example of inserting a bunch of rows as a single blob of text
[23:37:10] <gtristan> which probably does not map directly to using .append() on a collection of existing DOM nodes
[23:38:03] <sacho_> I don't know why calling append or remove would cause a reflow before the rest of your code is finished
[23:38:05] <sacho_> that seems bogus
[23:40:01] <gtristan> I thought so too
[23:41:33] <gtristan> hmmm, the remove/reattach method shaves off a reliable 40ms :-/
[23:41:34] <sacho_> I'm not sure just appending causes a reflow, most browsers probably cache that
[23:41:52] <sacho_> unless you try to check some of the live properties e.g. width/height
[23:42:22] <gtristan> hmmm, we have some ellipsis in the rows
[23:42:25] <gtristan> that might be it
[23:44:01] <gtristan> eek
[23:44:28] <gtristan> but the actual function from that blog 'removeToInsertLater' itself is taking 250ms
[23:44:40] <gtristan> for the removal of the single table node :-S
[23:45:52] <linyu> somebody know how to auto switch the page by device, like foundation ?
[23:47:03] <linyu> I am learning jquery mobile now, help me, please, thank you
[23:55:20] <sacho_> gtristan, well, what does it do?
[23:57:05] <gtristan> hard to say
[23:57:46] <gtristan> sacho_, I tried removing the css which sets up ellipsis, that doesnt change performance
[23:58:07] <gtristan> the actual native call to removeChild() is taking surprisingly long though
[23:58:33] <gtristan> it's parentNode.removeChild (<table with 1000 rows>)
[23:58:51] <gtristan> takes ~270ms
[23:58:59] * sacho_ shrugs
[23:59:09] <sacho_> tables are a nightmare to reflow
