[00:00:23] <_ramo> Cork: it seems, that this is not working for ie7
[00:00:35] <Cork> IAmWill: ok, then you need to add it to onload on that page
[00:00:47] <Cork> (sorry for the delay)
[00:01:39] <Cork> SpinachHead: no not at all
[00:02:02] <Cork> SpinachHead: if anything it will load faster, as you do one less http get command
[00:02:38] <pronoy> okay the toggle is implemented incorrectly nardev but I can't figure out how to use showOrhide correctly
[00:02:55] <SpinachHead> Okay, that's what I figured, but I put the jquery below some javascipt that is old and crufty, so wasn't sure...
[00:03:22] <Cork> SpinachHead: you should prob put jquery first in the file
[00:03:30] <Cork> its safer that way
[00:04:07] <SpinachHead> Yeah, maybe.  Unfortunately, it is old legacy code where the is no .inc files just every page include one huge .js file. And there is millions of pages.
[00:05:42] <AlbireoX> how could I convert json to url parameters?
[00:05:58] <Cork> json or javascript objects?
[00:06:22] <AlbireoX> json
[00:06:26] <Zogot> isn't it serialize either way?
[00:06:36] <Cork> JSON.parse(json)
[00:06:45] <AlbireoX> thanks
[00:06:47] <Cork> give that to the ajax call and jquery does the rest
[00:06:57] <AlbireoX> also, is there a better way to do this: http://pastebin.com/GSBeCCpk
[00:07:04] <AlbireoX> setting data does not work
[00:07:09] <AlbireoX> for some reason
[00:07:40] <Zogot> could send be a reserved word?
[00:07:53] <Cork> AlbireoX: data in the success call is not what you set in data:
[00:07:53] <AlbireoX> hmm, idk
[00:08:03] <Cork> no its not
[00:08:16] <Cork> AlbireoX: and btw, thats not json
[00:08:22] <AlbireoX> what is it?
[00:08:22] <Cork> thats a javascript object
[00:08:27] <AlbireoX> oh ok
[00:08:29] <AlbireoX> thanks
[00:08:35] <Cork> json is a string
[00:08:45] <AlbireoX> ok
[00:08:52] <AlbireoX> so how would I send those parameters into the url
[00:09:04] <AlbireoX> as in myurl?a=a&id=id etc
[00:09:12] <Cork> uh.. you use type: 'get' ?
[00:09:22] <AlbireoX> but I need to send post data
[00:09:25] <AlbireoX> to that url
[00:09:39] <Cork> you need to use a get and post at the same time?
[00:09:43] <Cork> ugg...
[00:09:49] <AlbireoX> yes, how would i do that? sorry...
[00:09:58] <Cork> you would have to generate the url your self
[00:10:04] <Cork> data will be sent as post data
[00:10:32] <AlbireoX> ok, so is there an easy way to change the javascript object into url parameters?
[00:10:54] <Cork> url: url + '?' + $.param(send)
[00:11:01] <AlbireoX> thanks
[00:11:10] <Zogot> serialize should do it no?
[00:11:19] <Cork> no
[00:11:29] <Cork> serialize works with dom objects
[00:12:21] <Zogot> ah fair enough :)
[00:13:39] <AlbireoX> Another thing: how would I set the Cookie in the header?
[00:14:15] <AlbireoX> this is how I'm doing it right now: http://pastebin.com/8NfUefDU
[00:14:21] <AlbireoX> it's not working though
[00:14:58] <Cork> AlbireoX: and thats how it needs to be done
[00:15:08] <AlbireoX> :/
[00:15:14] <Cork> AlbireoX: though, i would prob put those objects inline instead of using extra variables
[00:15:33] <AlbireoX> I was just doing it to make my code more readable
[00:16:32] <AlbireoX> so why isn't this cookie being sent?
[00:18:27] <Cork> hmm, might be its overwritten
[00:18:40] <Cork> try something like doing it manualy in beforeSend
[00:18:55] <Cork> (never tried setting just Cookie in headers)
[00:19:12] <AlbireoX> i tried that
[00:19:36] <AlbireoX> it's still notshowing up with xhr.setRequestHeader("Cookie", "VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=" + c1 + "; LOGIN_INFO=" + c2);
[00:20:17] <AlbireoX> I can set other headers fine
[00:21:23] <Cork> do you get any errors?
[00:21:29] <AlbireoX> No
[00:21:56] <AlbireoX> Normally I would get "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", but i'm not
[00:22:47] <Cork> ah, its cross origin?
[00:23:05] <Cork> that might actually be blocked by the browser
[00:23:13] <Cork> (to set cookie that is)
[00:23:27] <AlbireoX> hmm, it looks like Cookie is a restricted header
[00:23:33] <AlbireoX> I guess I have to write this in Java...
[00:23:41] <Cork> ug...
[00:23:46] <AlbireoX> :/
[00:23:56] <Cork> you can set the cookie for your site
[00:24:09] <AlbireoX> For my site, but not for another site
[00:24:10] <Cork> but i don't think you can set it for other domains
[00:24:15] <Cork> exactly
[00:24:19] <AlbireoX> yeah
[00:24:30] <Cork> that would open up for a big heap of exploits
[00:24:35] <AlbireoX> Yup
[00:24:51] <AlbireoX> There should be an option or something to allow it for a specific page/site
[00:25:06] <Cork> i don't really see why it would be needed
[00:25:21] <Cork> you could just make a call to the server and make it set the cookie
[00:25:22] <AlbireoX> I need it... :)
[00:25:33] <AlbireoX> I don't have control over the other server
[00:25:47] <Cork> and thats actually why its not allowed :)
[00:26:53] <AlbireoX> :)
[00:32:56] <DukeDrake> hi
[00:33:12] <DukeDrake> How can I toggle an element while the mouse is hovering over it?
[00:33:46] <nVee-YAM> hey guys, is there a way like in php where you use include() to include content from a different file using jquery/javascript?
[00:34:21] <Hierofant> yes
[00:51:57] <RockMeAmadeus> Does .get serialize a url string for you?
[00:53:50] <SpinachHead> When I try using replace(/,/g, " ") and then reset the text I can remove the commas from a paragraph but then the embedded javascript gets rewritten without the <script> tags.  Anyone know how to remove a comma from a paragraph which has <script> and <a> tags?
[00:54:36] <Cork> SpinachHead: you mean regex it from a script tag?
[00:55:02] <SpinachHead> Let me paste the code.  Hold a sec
[00:55:15] <Cork> ?p @ SpinachHead
[00:55:15] <bot-t> SpinachHead, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:59:07] <richardjprice> is it possible to set the alt and/or title attribute on jquery's datepicker?
[01:02:27] <SpinachHead> http://jsbin.com/oruyef/2/edit         I just need to remove the one comma from that   text   ,LLC
[01:04:04] <mindis|wurk> <script> in <p>? ewww
[01:05:29] <Cork> SpinachHead: only way to modify that script part and it have a meaning, is by modifying it before its parsed
[01:05:52] <Cork> SpinachHead: modifying whats inside a script tag after its parsed, doens't do anything (at all)
[01:06:28] <mindis|wurk> the easiest solution would probably be putting that text in its own span and access the span(s) instead of the whole p
[01:06:32] <kez> hi guys
[01:06:38] <kez> I have this js object
[01:06:39] <kez> http://pastebin.com/y298irAa
[01:07:04] <kez> when I try to acces its tmdb_id prop (this.tmdb_id) I get null
[01:07:05] <SpinachHead> The problem is it is a footer on tons of pages and I don't want to edit all of them.
[01:07:24] <mindis|wurk> maybe i don't even want to ask why they don't share the footer code
[01:07:26] <kez> i'm doing console.log(this) , the prop is there , next line console.log(this.tmdb_id) , I get null
[01:07:27] <Cork> SpinachHead: fixing it though js is... BAD design
[01:07:44] <xec> SpinachHead: are these pages generated on server side perhaps?
[01:08:03] <xec> SpinachHead: maybe the footer only exists one place
[01:08:05] <SpinachHead> no, they are html pages.  It is legacy
[01:08:21] <Cork> SpinachHead: search and replace ftw! ;)
[01:09:01] <xec> yeah that shouldnt be too hard
[01:09:51] <SpinachHead> I was able to remove the comma with .text().replace(/,/g," ") but then it doesn't rewrite the <script> tags within that same paragraph. I guess I would need a better replace(/regex/)
[01:10:30] <kez> can anyone please help me?
[01:10:31] <StevenCodes22> Anyone mind helping me make this change through a list of images every 10 seconds

[01:14:22] <BuenGenio> does the Firebug Command Line have setter methods for elements returned by $ and $$?

[01:30:08] <White--> Hmm I've got a pretty well working doctrine driver implementation based on the mssql_* function. Is this something which can be simply sent as a pull request or is there some kind of process to bring in new "features" into doctrine2?
[01:33:26] <kez> is this normal ? :http://pastebin.com/Nisjdj8V
[01:34:09] <systemfault> Sure..
[01:34:24] <kez> why ?
[01:34:26] <systemfault> Because you don't understand what the A in AJAX means
[01:34:34] <systemfault> Asynchronous
[01:35:03] <systemfault> test is printed before the request is done.
[01:35:21] <systemfault> To work, the console.log statement needs to be in the callback
[01:35:22] <kez> oh
[01:35:43] <kez> you're right :)

[01:59:15] <ximarin> hi all, is it possible to set some kind of splash-screen as a default for every ajax-action that happens? so that I don#t have to define one for every single jax-request but for all at once
[02:00:12] <crab> ximarin: what do you mean, splash screen?
[02:00:33] <ximarin> some modal overlay shall show a spinner or something
[02:00:35] <Cork> ?.ajaxStart @ ximarin
[02:00:48] <Cork> gah.. the bot is dead -_-'
[02:00:55] <crab> using a global .ajaxStart and .ajaxStop callback will do what you want
[02:00:55] <ximarin> ^^

[02:01:15] <ximarin> ah, ok, I found that in the API but wasnt sure if that is what I want ;)

[02:08:56] <tommyd> Good morning everybody
[02:09:22] <slax> I am a bit new to javaScript and I have run into a problem. I am including a jQuery plugin on my index page as well as my .js file. But now I can't access the jQuery plugin in the code in my .js file. I keep getting an error unknown identifier. I have included the plugin before my .js file.
[02:09:36] <tommyd> I was playing with $.ajaxTransport recently to mock requests to a remote server
[02:10:56] <tommyd> and this works nicely and all, just to the point that I have a "catch-all" transport running as of now and some XHR requests (those which load a local HTML page) must not be mocked
[02:11:56] <tommyd> I haven't quite figured out what the "dataType" for ajaxTransport is all about
[02:12:55] <tommyd> if I could only use it to distinguish requests based on the requested meta type (e.g. text/html vs. application/json), then I cannot use that to solve my problem
[02:13:08] <tommyd> because the local HTML pages are text/html - and these must not be mocked
[02:13:22] <tommyd> but I have some remote text/html content as well - and this _has_ to be mocked
[02:14:11] <tommyd> slax: try $(document).ready(function() { ... your code here ... });
[02:17:18] <mixit> Anybody wants to help me with a small problem?
[02:18:09] <slax> tommyd i a function with a call to the plugin, the function is declared before calling it witch I do in $(document).ready(function() { ... }
[02:18:58] <mixit> Well, i am trying to make a script with the .fadeIn function with text. I want a text to fade in "word for word". Anybody knows how the script would look like?
[02:20:32] <quicksil1er> you'd have to wrap each word in a span, Mission-Critical
[02:20:35] <quicksil1er> erm, mixit
[02:20:52] <mindis|wurk> yeah, should be fairly simple. just blow your text into an array and create new spans or something while looping through those
[02:20:54] <slax> mixit try this http://jsfiddle.net/TcdQb/1/
[02:20:57] <quicksil1er> you could either produce it that way in the first place or use some JS to add the spans
[02:24:29] <slax> Perhaps I should rephrase my earlier question. Is it possible to include a plugin in the index file and below it include your own .js file and in said file make a call to the plugin included before it? I seem to be getting an error: unknown identifier
[02:25:17] <WasserDragoon> hello everyone, i would like to write my own drop down plugin, but hovering fast will expand the queue and this results in an animation loop which doesn't looks good and seems to be buggy http://jsfiddle.net/As279/
[02:25:27] <WasserDragoon> maybe someone can tell me how to avoid that
[02:26:09] <WasserDragoon> just hover the element, move the mouse a little bit down so the pointer hovers the element always when it drops down
[02:26:25] <quicksil1er> slax: yes, that is fine. scripts load in the order you put them so later files can use earlier scripts.
[02:26:40] <quicksil1er> slax: otherwise no javascript libraries would work! or at least it would be a pain.
[02:26:46] <quicksil1er> slax: you must have some other problem.
[02:27:11] <mindis|wurk> WasserDragoon hehe, that's a pretty common flaw on mouseover gimmicks
[02:27:21] <slax> Okay at least I am on the right track. I will go back and look at the documentation of the plugin, I suppose I might have missed something.
[02:27:52] <WasserDragoon> mindis|wurk: and how to fix this? :-)
[02:28:16] <mindis|wurk> well you should probably stop playing the animation when the mouse is no longer over it
[02:30:09] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. Do you know any jQuery plugin that does this: http://www.amazon.com/toys-lego-construction-learning/b/ref=ty_nav_brand_lego?ie=UTF8&node=236510011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-7&pf_rd_r=1M0G4CHNE4QMBJCGT6WV&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1339139042&pf_rd_i=165793011 (see the bottom of the page where the product scroll is in 'Your recent history')
[02:30:35] <jaffipaffi> See when the window resizes - then the number of items changes
[02:31:41] <avalarion_> Olla, I have a problem with appending my Ajax Call into #mypost....
[02:31:43] <avalarion_> http://pastebin.com/uLeGyV56
[02:33:03] <jaffipaffi> avalarion_:  $('#mypost').append(data);
[02:33:29] <avalarion_> >.<
[02:34:27] <jaffipaffi> :D
[02:34:40] <avalarion_> jaffipaffi: works, thanks^^
[02:35:11] <avalarion_> jaffipaffi: was the otherway mootools? not shure anymore, but in my head appending was the other way...
[02:35:53] <jaffipaffi> avalarion_: Don't know. But it was definately wrong :p
[02:37:50] <Chaines51> Is $().position() deprecated? I keep getting an error on chrome taht it doesn't work
[02:38:03] <Chaines51> that*
[02:38:45] <ravenzz> $('#foo').position() should work
[02:39:23] <ravenzz> you'll be able to get the top and left pos
[02:39:48] <ravenzz> $('#foo').position().top
[02:40:33] <Chaines51> yea, it's not working.
[02:40:54] <Chaines51> it keeps telling me $("#myDiv").position() isn't a function
[02:41:09] <Chaines51> rather, $("#myDiv") has no function position()
[02:41:54] <ravenzz> I need to see a ?demo at this point
[02:42:05] <jakobkpoulsen> Is there a way to add HTML elements to the DOM without a trigger? I have a script that automatically adds new rows to a table, but is not triggered by a click event. Live(), bind() and delegate() all seem to be tied to events.
[02:42:46] <ravenzz> so how would you add those rows?
[02:43:00] <jakobkpoulsen> it happens if a condition is met.
[02:43:10] <ravenzz> where? when?
[02:43:12] <ravenzz> lol
[02:43:43] <ravenzz> if (foo) { $('body').append(bar); }
[02:43:43] <ravenzz> ?
[02:44:13] <jakobkpoulsen> Way up the application it happens on a click, but the rows are being added much later. If that makes sense?
[02:44:18] <jakobkpoulsen> Append would work?
[02:44:44] <jakobkpoulsen> I simply add them with .after now
[02:44:56] <ravenzz> yep depends on your needs
[02:45:05] <ravenzz> or where you want to adde them
[02:45:31] <ravenzz> ?demo @ jakobkpoulsen
[02:45:31] <bot-t> jakobkpoulsen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[02:45:39] <jakobkpoulsen> they are being added to an existing table, but as new rows instead of replacing rows.
[02:45:57] <jakobkpoulsen> I'll put together a demo :)
[02:46:18] <ravenzz> yep, you can append it to the end of the table, or prepend (so they well be added at the beginning of the table)
[02:46:26] <ravenzz> or after/before some element

[03:06:17] <bot-t> nVee-YAM, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[03:06:50] <_ramo> ravenzz: yeah, an excerpt would be great and if i hover the full title is shown
[03:06:57] <ravenzz> you should try that, the code seems correct except the return false stuff
[03:11:01] <nVee-YAM> ravenzz: the event is a parameter in .on(), so I do not know how to attach preventDefault
[03:11:12] <nVee-YAM> .on("click")
[03:11:38] <nVee-YAM> wait
[03:11:40] <nVee-YAM> got it haha
[03:12:05] <ravenzz> _ramo this could be a solution http://jsfiddle.net/NHZyf/
[03:12:28] <nVee-YAM> same issue
[03:12:38] <ravenzz> otherwise buh use substring ?
[03:13:07] <ravenzz> nVee do you have live demo?
[03:13:11] <_ramo> ravenzz: just css ?
[03:13:15] <ravenzz> the fiddle itself is correct
[03:13:48] <ravenzz> _ramo why not?
[03:14:12] <_ramo> thanks
[03:15:15] <ravenzz> _ramo oh remember that opera needs the vendor prefix -o-text-overflow
[03:15:30] <_ramo> ravenzz: thank you
[03:15:33] <ravenzz> yw
[03:25:36] <jakobkpoulsen> ravenzz: thanks. It worked with append :)
[03:34:09] <aidan> $('input').attr('checked', '') will check a checkbox ... how can I uncheck it?
[03:34:26] <ravenzz> ?removeAttr @ aidan
[03:34:26] <bot-t> aidan, .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[03:34:49] <ravenzz> aidan it would better to add true instead of an empty value
[03:35:31] <Chaines51> okay, so question. My server is returning a JSON array, but it's only one object right now. Is there anyway I can force javascript to consider it as an array of objects anyway?
[03:35:41] <aidan> ravenzz: It's left over jquery1.2 code - "" use to be False
[03:35:55] <aidan> so upgrading jquery gave me these weird results.
[03:45:17] <_ramo> does anyone of you customized the jquery ui autocomplete plugin?
[03:45:35] <_ramo> i want to add a box under the autcompletion list that says "Contact us for more information"
[03:50:35] <gizmore> i have an element with id '#wpcf7-f74-p53-o1' ...  how can i select this when only the 74 is known to me ... like searching for the element with id like -f74-
[03:51:16] <gizmore> using $('somegeneral').each() and checking with a regex pattern? Is there a better approach?
[03:51:34] <[1]redsquare> giz you can use ~= for contains
[03:54:10] <gizmore> [1]redsquare: could you show me an example selector please? Greatly appreciated :)
[03:55:16] <[1]redsquare> $('li[id~="f74"]') - find all li's with an id that contains f74
[03:56:15] <gizmore> thank you very much!
[04:07:37] <shomon> hi
[04:07:56] <shomon> is there an online example of how to do ajax on a form? I want to check if a username is already in the db for example
[04:08:39] <Hooloovoork> shomon: that's mostly server code. any basic ajax example should be enough to show you how it's done
[04:08:47] <_ramo> what's wrong on that: 	($('<div></div>', { border: "3px solid red", width: "100px", height: "30px"})).appendTo($(".ui-autocomplete")); ?
[04:08:53] <Hooloovoork> send postdata like {"username": "asdasd"}
[04:09:12] <Hooloovoork> and have the server return {"username_status": "busy/free"}
[04:09:12] <shomon> ah okay Hooloovoork so there's not a specific "jquery way" :)
[04:09:16] <Hooloovoork> or something like that
[04:09:39] <Hooloovoork> well there's a jquery way to do ajax, but not to do exactly what you're asking for with ajax
[04:10:01] <shomon> I see...
[04:13:15] <Hooloovoork> there are plugin forms tho that makes that stuff even easier
[04:14:32] <shomon> thanks Hooloovoork I'll have a look for some
[04:18:34] <Armonz> Hooloovoork: Main purpose of jQuery isn't serverside scripting
[04:19:12] <Armonz> Hooloovoork: http://weblogs.asp.net/karan/archive/2010/09/12/calling-server-side-method-using-jquery-ajax.aspx
[04:19:38] <burg> hello. http://codepad.org/Y3BTcWH2 - this code gives me "twitterCallback is not defined" error, where twitterCallback is callback set for $.getScript function. what am i doing wrong?
[04:19:40] <Hooloovoork> Armonz...
[04:20:24] <rzec> I have a selector that is pulling dozens of elements : $('.class').find('ul li:nth-child(1)') : what is the best way to find out the width of the widest element?  for example let say all element but one are 200px and the one that isn't 200px is 250px, I want to get the value 250 (is there a better/faster way than doing .each of the elements to the large width value?).
[04:20:37] <Hooloovoork> Armonz: can jquery even be used for server side scripting? i mean jquery wouldn't be of much use in like nodejs...
[04:21:26] <Armonz> Node.js is Cancer
[04:23:28] <nVee-YAM> Hey guys, I am trying to use .on() with url's added to the DOM using $.post(). the URL is created within $.post("url",function() { // URL HERE };) but .on() does not work. Any ideas? Can this even be done?
[04:24:12] <nVee-YAM> If I create the URL and it is loaded within the DOM (not using $.post()) it does process the function, but if the url is added after page load with $.post() it does not work at all
[04:24:22] <burg> any idea regarding my problem?
[04:25:11] <Hooloovoork> Armonz: it's fun, but not useful =P
[04:25:17] <Hooloovoork> i wouldn't say cancer though...
[04:43:31] <mindis|wurk> anyone know a handy way to strip tags without destroying the contents? for example, if i had <div>Fish tastes <strong>good</strong>, thank you for the <em>fish</em>.</div> and wanted it turned into <div>Fish tastes good, thank you for the fish.</div>
[04:46:21] <mindis|wurk> the silence is deafening. guess it's regexp time then
[04:48:12] <johnathanb> mindis|wurk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652917/in-jquery-want-to-remove-all-html-inside-of-a-div
[04:48:35] <mindis|wurk> thanks, i can google
[04:48:57] <johnathanb> Then why didn't you do that in the first place instead of asking here dick stain?
[04:49:18] <mindis|wurk> i asked because i was looking for a handier way of doing it
[04:54:30] <dragon-irl> Hi, It says in the docs that some browsers won't support PUT, DELETE, etc for the type argument for $.ajax. Is there a list of supported browsers somewhere?
[05:05:01] <poppiez> I've created a slideshow. I have trouble with memory. as each image is loaded the memory increases rapidly. I have a placeholder div where I place the images. everytime the slide changes the images are cleared and new are inserted. for some reason, the memory isn't freed again. any way to prevent this from happening? do I have to put no-cache headers on the images?
[05:05:52] <mindis|wurk> keep all the images but show and hide the ones you need?
[05:06:09] <poppiez> mindis|wurk: there can be unlimited number of images. that would be too intensive
[05:06:32] <mindis|wurk> sounds like a scary site
[05:06:40] <poppiez> huh?
[05:06:54] <poppiez> a slideshow plugin should be able to support as many pages as the user wants - no big deal
[05:07:31] <Fabryz> hello, i'm using jquerymobile, trying vmousemove but event.pageX doesn't seem to be working. What to do? http://jsfiddle.net/tptZE/7/
[05:07:48] <poppiez> Fabryz: try event.originalEvent.pageX
[05:08:15] <Fabryz> poppiez, it worked thanks
[05:08:23] <Fabryz> how come this is not specified on the docs?
[05:08:37] <poppiez> Fabryz: jquery keeps special props in the originalEvent property
[05:08:41] <poppiez> it should be
[05:09:00] <Fabryz> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/api/events.html this is the latest one right?
[05:09:24] <poppiez> "originalEvent" is not jquery mobile specific. it's just jquery that w orks like that. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[05:10:33] <Fabryz> ok, hoped the docs could be more clear
[05:13:43] <Fabryz> poppiez it doesn't seem to be working on an ipad, gives me undefined
[05:14:09] <poppiez> console.log() the event and look for yourself
[05:14:44] <Fabryz> is there a console in safari mobile on ipad? (not the owner of this)
[05:15:03] <poppiez> settings -> safari -> advanced -> enable debugging
[05:15:48] <Fabryz> poppiez thanks
[05:16:52] <poppiez> you should probably try e.originalEvent.changedTouches[0].pageX;
[05:17:48] <Frantic> guys, any idea how I could change the label of a select's <option> label depending if it's open or closed? Consider an input with months for several years, and I have an optionGroup called 2012 with "Jan", "Feb", etc options below it. How can I get the input to say "Jan 2012" when closed?
[05:18:21] <Frantic> by input I mean the closed <select>
[05:19:32] <Fabryz> poppiez, no it doesnt work. And unfortunately console.dir shows [object Object]
[05:20:48] <poppiez> Fabryz: console.log(JSON.stringify(e));
[05:21:35] <luke--> hi there
[05:22:15] <luke--> is there an function that acts like $.extend but does *not* overwrite iexisting methods/properties?

[05:30:01] <csmrfx> it probably has a class or style attribute that is unique in the ul
[05:31:48] <luke--> kavelot: http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[05:32:23] <kavelot> luke--: the problem is that I need the index (inside the ul) of this <li>
[05:33:24] <Cork> kavelot: do you have the li as a dom item?
[05:33:43] <[1]redsquare> kavelot $('ul>li:visible').index()

[05:49:06] <mixit> Hi again, i was on here about 2h ago, asking about a text fading effect. i got a link for a javascript testing site. and i have lost the link for that site :(
[05:49:39] <mixit> so if anybody knows what i mean, or remembers me. please send me that link, thanks :)
[05:52:07] <sadmicrowave> mixit, jsfiddle?
[05:53:08] <sadmicrowave> mixit, here is the actual site you were given: http://jsfiddle.net/TcdQb/1/
[05:54:50] <sadmicrowave> mixit, bookmark jsfiddle.net, register as a new user, open the link I just gave you, 'fork' it to another instance, then it will be in your cached project dashboard until you delete it
[06:02:03] <mixit> thank you!! :*
[06:02:06] <whateverb> I want to replace every number in the array once, not replacing numbers that have been already  replaced once. How?

[06:03:38] <slax> Hi guys I just ran into another problem. I am trying to use the fullCalendar plugin within the overlay created by colorbox but I can't figure out how to get the fullCalendar to render within colorbox.

[06:13:26] <MagePsycho> Hi guys
[06:13:36] <MagePsycho> has anyone issue with nyroModal lightbox
[06:14:50] <gheegh_> MagePsycho: We use it in our app.. not had big problems with it..
[06:14:59] <gheegh_> but i'm not the coder.. so I can't tell you if we modded it.
[06:15:24] <MagePsycho> actually the issue is: when i click on the left/right nav of gallery then image disappears
[06:15:33] <MagePsycho> https://danieldefense.com/daniel-defense-le-duty-rifle-light-weight-package.html
[06:15:37] <MagePsycho> you can check there
[06:16:26] <kapowaz> are there any custom events bound when you use jQuery validate on a form?
[06:18:03] <gheegh_> MagePsycho: I confirmed the error.. when you're in the gallery mode, if you click left and right eventually you'll get a blank page instead of a picture.  Right?
[06:18:19] <MagePsycho> Yeah
[06:18:35] <MagePsycho> correct gheegh_ that's the issue
[06:19:25] <gheegh_> Don't have an answer for it.. :-) but, just wanted to help make the issue statement as clear as possible.
[06:19:30] <megalomix> hello everybody
[06:20:12] <gheegh_> I actually am a backend programmer, ruby, and I'm just trying to get enough chops to be dangerous in Jquery..
[06:20:12] <MagePsycho> NP gheegh_
[06:20:22] <megalomix> i have a form with many checkboxes inside named "value_1" "value_2" etc etc I have to listen to the click event.....when someone click on one checkbox i have to get the number after the underscore, could someone help me?
[06:21:28] <gheegh_> and here's my question.  "this" should be the handle i use inside of a jquery click function when I want o manipulate a clicked dom element.. right?  here is my example code. I'm trying to increment the value of a span by 1.  https://gist.github.com/1621051
[06:22:46] <Zogot> gheegh_: you shoudl look into .data
[06:22:53] <Zogot> it would be alot easier
[06:23:53] <MoneY> Hello. Ist there a way to use trigger mouse right-click? trigger('contexmenu') does not work.
[06:24:04] <megalomix> guys I have: $('input:checkbox').click(function(){ ... }
[06:24:15] <megalomix> how to know the ID of the checkbox ?
[06:24:16] <kapowaz> megalomix: https://gist.github.com/08c00d0bd71aebe8b6b2
[06:24:17] <Hooloovoork> MoneY: a sec, i'll check
[06:24:25] <megalomix> i see thank you
[06:24:28] <kapowaz> oh wait, checkboxes not radios
[06:24:29] <MoneY> $('input:checkbox').click(function(){$(this).attr('id')}
[06:24:56] <kapowaz> megalomix: updated the above gist, try that.
[06:25:08] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: thanks.
[06:25:25] <yolin> how can I add listener to all events for a node?
[06:25:45] <Hooloovoork> MoneY: yup you can
[06:25:59] <kborchers_> yolin: all events? what are you trying to do?
[06:26:21] <yolin> kborchers_, I want to monitor and filter out stuff
[06:26:22] <Hooloovoork> $("#ele").bind("mousedown", function(ev) { console.log(ev.button) });
[06:26:26] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: $('html body > *').live('mousedown', function(e){$(e.target).trigger('contextmenu');}); <--- this is not working.
[06:26:30] <Hooloovoork> ev.button is 2 if it's rmb
[06:26:32] <Hooloovoork> else it's lmb
[06:26:33] <yolin> kborchers_, is it possible?
[06:26:53] <Hooloovoork> or some other button
[06:27:38] <AdvoWork> i have a simple example here of jquery buttons, 2 have their own class, but the class/css isnt picking up. Any ideas please? http://jsfiddle.net/7vvhj/113/
[06:27:48] <kborchers_> yolin: i guess i still don't understand. why on earth would you need to bind to every possible event? and there is no magic $.bindToEveryPossibleEvent()
[06:28:31] <megalomix> kapowaz, cannot read property of 1 of null
[06:28:44] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: still there?
[06:28:51] <Hooloovoork> MoneY: yup
[06:29:07] <yolin> kborchers_, okay thanks
[06:29:15] <megalomix> i have to read ID
[06:29:17] <megalomix> not name
[06:29:30] <kapowaz> megalomix: that might be why then. You said they were ‘named’ value_1 etc. ;)
[06:29:40] <kapowaz> you know how to fix that, yes?
[06:29:42] <megalomix> ehehe yes i'm sorry
[06:29:45] <megalomix> yes yes
[06:29:49] <kborchers_> yolin: if you explain what exactly you are trying to do, we may be able to suggest better methods
[06:29:52] <megalomix> 'id' isntead of 'name'
[06:31:23] <yolin> kborchers_, thanks but even I feel I need to sit down and think more :D
[06:31:55] <kborchers_> yolin: ok, well if you come up with a different method and you have other questions, you know where to find us :)
[06:32:04] <Hooloovoork> MoneY: does it work?
[06:32:08] <yolin> kborchers_, yes ofcourse ^_^
[06:32:17] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: sorry i dc'ed can repost last msg?
[06:33:07] <Hooloovoork> check the jquery channel log, don't wanna spam =P
[06:33:28] <MoneY> uhm, no log here.. web irc :S
[06:33:50] <Hooloovoork> hmmm there should be a log somewhere
[06:34:16] <Hooloovoork> $("#ele").bind("mousedown", function(ev) { console.log(ev.button) });
[06:34:21] <Hooloovoork> there's what you need to do
[06:34:29] <MoneY> uhm yes i got it but
[06:34:36] <MoneY> i need something like that: $('html body > *').live('mousedown', function(e){$(e.target).trigger('contextmenu');});
[06:34:40] <megalomix> guys, last thing :-)
[06:34:41] <Hooloovoork> ev.button is different depending on which mousebutton you pressed
[06:35:07] <megalomix> i have to do something like: INTERVAL 1 YEAR In jquery :D eheh I have to add one year to a date
[06:35:08] <megalomix> how to do ? :D
[06:35:53] <MoneY> megalomix: use javascript Date object to create new Date
[06:36:42] <kborchers_> megalomix: jQuery is not a date utility. if you need to do a lot of date manipulation, i recommend see ?g moment.js
[06:36:43] <bot-t> megalomix, Moment.js - A lightweight javascript date library - http://momentjs.com/
[06:40:58] <megalomix> ah ok perfect
[06:40:58] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: do you know how to reserve my problem? :)
[06:41:05] <megalomix> i only have to add ONE year to a date
[06:41:45] <AdvoWork> where can i find the UI images such as the ui-icon-locked icon?
[06:41:48] <Hooloovoork> MoneY: What problem? i just sent you code to fix the mouseclick thingy
[06:42:02] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: i need something like that: $('html body > *').live('mousedown', function(e){$(e.target).trigger('contextmenu');});
[06:42:50] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: i need to trigger the contextmenu, not the listner :)
[06:42:59] <sadmicrowave> megalomix, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+add+a+year+to+date
[06:43:07] <sadmicrowave> ??
[06:43:11] <slax> Could anyone explain how i can use the fullCalendar plugin: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ with colorbox: http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/ I can't figure out how to get the calendar plugin to work inside the colorbox overlay
[06:43:28] <megalomix> sadmicrowave, thank you i see
[06:43:41] <sadmicrowave> megalomix, the first link should be what you want
[06:44:09] <Hooloovoork> MoneY: just use that code i sent. $("#whatever").bind("click", function(ev) { if(ev.button === 2) $("something").trigger(); })
[06:44:51] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: alright thanks :)
[06:44:54] <Hooloovoork> np
[06:46:07] <sadmicrowave> AdvoWork, http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[06:50:23] <megalomix> exuse me, but when i do: var expiryDate = new Date()
[06:50:30] <megalomix> ti save DATE + TIME
[06:50:35] <megalomix> how to save only the date?
[06:51:34] <sadmicrowave> megalomix, google is your friend....also, so is #javascript
[06:51:38] <chrisinajar> megalomix: i don't like javascript has a data type just for date without time. If you're trying to get the date out, then you can use the getters
[06:51:58] <chrisinajar> megalomix: just google 'javascript date' and read the docs, they're super simple
[06:52:12] <megalomix> ok thank you
[06:52:14] <megalomix> excuse me :)
[06:52:15] <chrisinajar> np
[06:52:34] <sadmicrowave> but to answer your question; d = new Date(); month = d.getMonth(); day = d.getDay(); year = d.getFullYear();
[06:52:56] <chrisinajar> sadmicrowave: don't do that, now he doesn't know how to fish.
[06:53:21] <chrisinajar> sadmicrowave: also your screenname is hilarious
[06:53:59] <megalomix> :)
[06:54:20] <megalomix> chrisinajar, I did not see it, don't worry
[06:54:21] <megalomix> :D
[06:54:29] <chrisinajar> ok. So I have a page that works on all browsers on all computers tested but one. One of my co-workers entire IE8 window freezes for a solid 45 seconds when loading this page, which i believe is being caused by his virus scanner. This site is the only one it does it to, and only his computer does it.
[06:54:38] <sadmicrowave> chrisinajar, the animals in the wild that don't have the instinct to eat/find food, will die (darwinism at it's finest), I'm just delaying the inevitable so I don't have to witness it first hand
[06:55:34] <chrisinajar> we have other computers with the same OS/browser/scanner combo that do not have the issue, so there could be another variable here, but nonetheless this is the only page that has this problem.....
[06:55:47] <chrisinajar> anyone ever had any issues where virus scanners were totally breaking IE8? :D
[07:09:09] <MoneY> Hooloovoork: can you shortly explain me why this condition: if(ev.button === 2)  ?
[07:15:30] <kapowaz> it seems that jQuery validate *by default* adds a validation rule to any input[type=date] which causes it to be always invalid when the datepicker control is used to change the input's value in iOS 5.0. Has anybody else encountered this problem and do they have any ideas how to workaround?
[07:16:03] <Kingsy> is fadeToggle() not included in jquery 1.4.2 ?
[07:21:26] <kapowaz> comparing the source to 1.7.1 it appears not
[07:21:28] <helllen> helllo
[07:21:47] <helllen> someone knows how to delete a entier branch in a jtreetable?
[07:21:54] <AdvoWork> Any reason why, when ive got $('#raise_po_button').attr("disabled", true); and then try and set it to false, it doesn't do anything?
[07:21:59] <explodes> Hey guys, what does $('[src]') do?
[07:22:06] <explodes> Selects elements with that attribute?
[07:22:26] <helllen> I do delete a row but it doens't delete the childrens...
[07:22:57] <kapowaz> AdvoWork: what version of jQuery are you using?
[07:23:50] <kapowaz> if it's a version after 1.6.1 then the behaviour of $().attr() might not be what you're expecting — read http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/10/jquery-1-6-1-rc-1-released/
[07:24:09] <kapowaz> basically if you're setting/unsetting properties like disabled you should be using $().prop('disabled', true) (or false)
[07:26:11] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, 1.5.1 afaik
[07:26:18] <Flavius1924> hello.i have a toggle function and i want when i click on something to appear an image
[07:26:30] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i do that ?
[07:26:32] <AdvoWork> ive even tried doign: $('#raise_po_button').removeAttr("disabled"); and then setting it to false
[07:27:10] <kapowaz> AdvoWork: what kind of element is it you're manipulating?
[07:27:37] <kapowaz> I seem to remember that jQuery's behaviour with property attributes used to be kind of flakey, possibly one of the reasons the changes were made
[07:28:04] <kapowaz> oh wait, are you basically changing your element so that it has <foo disabled="false"> ?
[07:28:12] <kapowaz> what doctype is this with?
[07:28:31] <kapowaz> because <foo disabled="false"> is semantically identical to <foo disabled="true"> in HTML 5
[07:29:38] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, its just a button
[07:32:11] <kapowaz> then the above is true.
[07:32:39] <kapowaz> if you're using pre-1.6.1 jQuery, remove the attribute completely when you want it to be enabled
[07:34:13] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, ive tried that, so now i'm doing: $('#raise_po_button').removeAttr("disabled");
[07:34:17] <AdvoWork> lemme jsfiddle it
[07:34:48] <kapowaz> AdvoWork: just to be clear, are you saying that when you remove the attribute entirely and do nothing further, the element remains disabled?
[07:36:39] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, yeah, but my example on js works lol
[07:37:04] <kapowaz> then maybe something else is doing the disabling :)
[07:37:14] <kapowaz> tried it in a different browser?
[07:37:19] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, my example is http://jsfiddle.net/7vvhj/114/
[07:37:27] <AdvoWork> test unlocks it
[07:37:31] <kapowaz> I seem to recall that Firebug sometimes lies about properties being on elements when they're manipulated with JS
[07:37:36] <AdvoWork> im using the same code in my app, which is weird
[07:37:47] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: removing that attribute does undisable it. perhaps in your example the parent enelement is disabled too, disabledness is inherited...
[07:38:30] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: like if it's in a disabled form, for example
[07:38:43] <AdvoWork> ill check, the thing is, it changes the icon state, so that part of code is working if you get me
[07:38:54] <kapowaz> that code has a hella lot of repetition
[07:39:05] <kapowaz> might make it easier on yourself if you DRY'd it up a bit
[07:40:04] <kapowaz> $('#send_po_button, #raise_po_button, #view_po_button').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); has the same effect as the first 3 lines of your example
[07:40:14] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, ok, thanks for that, and the pointer
[07:40:26] <Guest77435> I am working on a slide show. I have 2 buttons for next and previous. If I lick them once every 1-2 secs, they work perfectly. However, if I try to click really fast, it messes up the slide order. Any one know why?
[07:40:51] <chrisinajar> Guest77435: probably animations queuing up.
[07:40:53] <kapowaz> licking your buttons.
[07:40:55] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, chrisinajar here are the button states http://pastebin.com/KUA57mMn  before enabling and after enabling
[07:41:33] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: i still stand on what i said before.
[07:42:06] <AdvoWork> nothing else is disabled though, just checked
[07:42:15] <chrisinajar> check again, clearly something is.
[07:42:45] <AdvoWork> ive just double checked :/
[07:42:48] <chrisinajar> computers don't lie. There's either a findable bug in your code, in the browser, or you're doing it wrong. right now i believe the problem is the 3rd.
[07:44:54] <AdvoWork> well, ive just done a mass search on anything related to being disabled, and theres no code other than what I pasted. I'm using chrome tools for JS console and firebug but nothing in either of those
[07:45:05] <AdvoWork> im not saying theres not an error, but I cant find it lol
[07:45:16] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: is there an example online of your bug?
[07:46:06] <Guest77435> I am working on a slide show. I have 2 buttons for next and previous. If I click them once every 1-2 secs, they work perfectly. However, if I try to click really fast, it messes up the slide order. Any one know why?
[07:47:45] <AdvoWork> chrisinajar, When i disable it to begin with, it sets it to disabled="" role="button" aria-disabled="true"  yet after, it sets it to: role="button" aria-disabled="true"  so could it not be setting it as disabled correctly? I tried to replicate it on jsfiddle but it works on there, but i do loads of additional processing with datatables etc etc
[07:48:26] <yolin> if I use css() to get value for "border-radius", will it automatically add browser prefix and return the proper value?
[07:48:45] <AdvoWork> chrisinajar, can i somehow get the status (doing a check first) to see if it really is disabled or something?
[07:49:10] <chrisinajar> yolin: borderRadius, and try it and see.
[07:49:35] <yolin> chrisinajar, okay
[07:50:16] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: .attr('disabled', 'disabled') disables and doesn't add any of that other stuff. somethines else is adding those. find it.
[07:52:37] <yolin> chrisinajar, its not working
[07:52:41] <AdvoWork> chrisinajar, hmm, ive just done alert($("#raise_po_button").is(":disabled"));  before, and after, before it says true, after i unlock it, with$('#raise_po_button').removeAttr("disabled"); it says false, so i think it thinks its enabled, but its appearance doesn?
[07:52:55] <kapowaz> AdvoWork: Firefox?
[07:53:01] <yolin> neither borderRadius nor -webkit-border-radius works
[07:54:27] <chrisinajar> yolin: because you can't use hyphens in css names in jquery, that's be webkitBorderRadius
[07:55:00] <AdvoWork> kapowaz, chrome
[07:56:09] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: there is clearly more going on in your web app. you need to find that, because if you don't know what your app is doing i don't know why you think any of us will
[07:56:40] <chrisinajar> AdvoWork: if you can get a testcase working, then we can definitely help, but if you have a mystery bug that only happens inside your app then there isn't anything we can do without access to your full app...
[07:57:07] <yolin> chrisinajar, even that doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/69Ldt/
[07:58:33] <chrisinajar> yolin: apparently '-webkit-border-radius' does work, weird.
[07:58:36] <chrisinajar> didn't think it would
[07:58:39] <risky_s> hi, how do I set a specific format for a date, e.g. var date = new Date(), I want it with dd/mm/yyyy and the time, hours/minutes/seconds?
[07:58:43] <yolin> chrisinajar, okay
[07:58:58] <AdvoWork> chrisinajar, i was just about to go through it, but i tried  $("#raise_po_button").button().attr('disabled', false).removeClass( 'ui-state-disabled' ); which now works.. does that still mean something is doing something it shouldnt be?
[07:59:25] <chrisinajar> risky_s: d.getDay() + '/' + d.getMonth().....
[07:59:32] <risky_s> oh thanks
[07:59:41] <risky_s> I thought there was a quicker way
[07:59:59] <chrisinajar> there might be, google 'javascript date' and look at the API docs
[08:00:51] <yolin> chrisinajar, for me event -webkit-border-radius is not working
[08:00:56] <yolin> *even
[08:01:20] <risky_s> I checked but there a examples of the similar format like you have stated, I thought there might be one like PHP where you can state a format like ("m/d/y")
[08:02:21] <gordian> what happened to the excel chan on freenode?
[08:05:58] <Geneller> hi everyone, how can i "move" some html form and the entered data to another div ?
[08:06:24] <Geneller> i've been trying getting the html and appending it to the destination div
[08:07:08] <Geneller> but when i get back the data, some fields are empty
[08:08:11] <Know1edge1> hey guys
[08:08:15] <bwq> hi
[08:08:26] <bwq> noticed .live() was deprecated so i switched to .on()
[08:08:36] <bwq> .on() doesn't work the way i use live though
[08:08:49] <Know1edge1> im working on creating a bookmarklet with jquery.. .was wondering if you guys had any ideas on the best way to store a username/api key combo - so I can make api requests on the users behalf to my service
[08:08:52] <bwq> it should, but it doesn't
[08:11:32] <Geneller> anyone ?
[08:14:35] <chrisinajar> bwq: is that a question or a complaint?
[08:15:14] <bwq> both
[08:15:18] <bwq> more of a question though
[08:15:28] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: doesn't really matter, either way you need to use ssl else anyone can intercept it
[08:15:35] <chrisinajar> bwq: i would recommend asking a question then :P
[08:15:59] <bwq> i use json to get data and then i add it to a url of a certain class
[08:16:08] <bwq> and i got a .on() attached to that class
[08:16:09] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar: ofcourse ssl, just trying to think of the best way to store it
[08:16:25] <bwq> however, after inserting it, the .on() event won't get triggered
[08:16:32] <bwq> when using .live(), it works just fine
[08:16:34] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: depends entirely on your use case
[08:17:00] <bwq> which is pretty weird actually since .live() only started working like this since i updated from jquery 1.3.2 to 1.7.1
[08:17:15] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar: think of an abstract case, only want a user to add new data via restful api calls based on their username and api token
[08:17:16] <bwq> before this i used php to echo new jquery along with the request
[08:17:30] <bwq> now i can just use .live() defined in the main .js
[08:17:38] <chrisinajar> bwq: ok, lets start over. What are you trying to do? What are you doing now? What happens instead? Do you get any errors? Please paste a testcase to jsfiddle.
[08:18:11] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: that still has nothing to do with how you store it.
[08:18:23] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: just put it in a cookie
[08:18:39] <chrisinajar> seems like you're looking for someone to design your app for you, so there :P
[08:18:52] <bwq> k, basically
[08:18:53] <bwq> .live('click', function(){
[08:18:53] <bwq> 	  $(this).css({'font-weight': 'bold'});
[08:18:53] <bwq> 	  return false;
[08:18:53] <bwq>     });
[08:18:56] <chrisinajar> bwq: no
[08:18:59] <bwq> that's what i use now
[08:18:59] <chrisinajar> bwq: jsfiddle.net
[08:19:02] <bwq> k :p
[08:19:04] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar:  so just use normal php sessions/cookies and have the app reauthenticate
[08:19:06] <chrisinajar> bwq: i do not read code pasted onto irc
[08:19:45] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: is this a php question or a jquery question? I know both, i just have no idea what part of your application you're talking about.
[08:20:05] <chrisinajar> i had assumed you were talking about JS, in which case the concept of a session does not exist and you cannot run PHP code, so no.
[08:20:14] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar: it's kind of mixed… i just asked in here because im going to  be making a bookmarklet with jquery
[08:20:26] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar: i mean authenticate the user on the php site
[08:20:37] <Know1edge1> then they can use the bookmarklet and reauthenticate if the session becomes stale
[08:20:47] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: yeah, go for it, that'd work
[08:21:05] <Know1edge1> alternatively, do you guys know of a good cross browser extension framework
[08:21:16] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: it seems like you already know how to solve your problem, if you need someone to pat you on the back i'll be happy to :)
[08:21:22] <Know1edge1> go ahead
[08:21:24] <Know1edge1> :P
[08:21:29] * chrisinajar pats Know1edge1 on the back
[08:21:34] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar: just thinking outloud :P
[08:21:39] <chrisinajar> don't worry, you're a good programmer, don't listen to the other kids
[08:21:44] <Know1edge1> rofl
[08:22:09] <bwq> so yeah
[08:22:12] <bwq> the save button doesn't work?
[08:22:18] <bwq> do i need to hit "run" to save it?
[08:22:28] <Know1edge1> save to save it
[08:22:30] <Know1edge1> run to run it
[08:22:38] <bwq> yeah it didn't work
[08:22:47] <bwq> looks like it finally went through after 20 secs :<
[08:22:49] <bwq> http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/
[08:23:12] <chrisinajar> bwq: jsfiddle kind of sucks sometimes, haha
[08:23:22] <chrisinajar> bwq: this does nothing
[08:23:29] <Phoenixz> I see a jquery function scrollTop(), but I can not find a scrollBottom() What method would I use to have the contents of a div scroll all the way to the bottom?
[08:23:58] <Know1edge1> use a negative value
[08:24:13] <Phoenixz> Know1edge1: That was for me?
[08:24:22] <sadmicrowave> bwq, what is the problem?
[08:24:48] <chrisinajar> sadmicrowave: your name is still awesome
[08:24:51] <bwq> yeah chrisinajar, of course, i used fake urls etc.
[08:24:52] <sadmicrowave> :)
[08:25:01] <bwq> but all the code is there
[08:25:07] <sadmicrowave> bwq, what is the problem?
[08:25:12] <bwq> .live() works, .on() doesn't
[08:25:26] <sadmicrowave> bwq, so use .live()
[08:25:30] <sadmicrowave> problem solved
[08:25:33] <bwq> but it's deprecated :p
[08:25:40] <bwq> that's why i wanted to "upgrade"
[08:25:55] <chrisinajar> on works fine for me..
[08:26:21] <sadmicrowave> bwq, is there a specific reason you are adding 'return false;' to the end of your functions?
[08:26:27] <chrisinajar> bwq: if you manage to get a test case working i can take a look at it, but i'm working while doing this, so i don't really have the time to decipher what you're trying to do, what you're doing, and what you're doing wrong...
[08:26:43] <chrisinajar> sadmicrowave: that way the default click event doesn't go off
[08:27:00] <bwq> yup, exactly
[08:27:15] <sadmicrowave> bwq, function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }
[08:27:23] <bwq> yeah i know :p
[08:27:25] <chrisinajar> IE hates that
[08:27:29] <sadmicrowave> ok
[08:27:32] <chrisinajar> return false works on all of them
[08:27:41] <chrisinajar> i use both, just to be safe :P
[08:28:08] <chrisinajar> bwq: anyway, on works, if you can show me it not working i can show you how to fix it.
[08:28:22] <sadmicrowave> bwq, what ver are you using?
[08:28:33] <chrisinajar> good question.
[08:28:42] <sadmicrowave> .on only works in 17
[08:28:44] <sadmicrowave> 1.7*
[08:28:52] <bwq> 1.7.1
[08:28:53] <chrisinajar> really? i thought it was old...
[08:29:03] * chrisinajar been using 1.7 for too long. spoiled.
[08:29:08] <bwq> yeah chrisinajar, guess i'll pull some json somewhere :p
[08:29:22] <chrisinajar> bwq: you don't need to, that's just a click event...
[08:30:04] <bwq> yeah, i'm just simulating me getting some json and then inserting data :D
[08:30:12] <z0n3d> l
[08:30:59] <chrisinajar> bwq: here is on working http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/1/
[08:31:04] <chrisinajar> using your event handler, too
[08:31:41] <sadmicrowave> bwq, I concur with chrisinajar, my testcase also works with .on(): http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/3/
[08:32:33] <chrisinajar> sadmicrowave: why is it so hard for people to make test cases?
[08:32:36] <Know1edge1> my test case doesnt: http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/4/
[08:32:54] <Know1edge1> any new elements introduced do not trigger a click handler
[08:33:02] <sadmicrowave> bwq, try taking .hide() our of your success event. It could be that your event handler is not cooperating with your element being display:none;
[08:33:10] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: yeah it does...
[08:33:24] <Know1edge1> chrisinajar: really?
[08:33:30] <Know1edge1> maybe its my jsfiddle session let ne refresh
[08:33:31] <chrisinajar> oh, i see
[08:33:31] <Know1edge1> me*
[08:33:34] <quicksilver> Know1edge1: that's not how you use on.
[08:33:37] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: you need to hook on their event too
[08:33:39] <quicksilver> read the documentation.
[08:33:48] <Know1edge1> quicksilver: thats how bwq wants to use it
[08:33:50] <Know1edge1> thats what i was testing
[08:33:52] <Know1edge1> is all
[08:33:54] <chrisinajar> Know1edge1: the newly added one has no event handlers yet
[08:34:03] <bwq> is $.getJSOn disabled or something?
[08:34:19] <quicksilver> if you want to apply to elements added later, you use an *enclosing* element for the call to .n
[08:34:19] <chrisinajar> i didn't understand what bwq was trying to do (and he wont tell me)
[08:34:22] <bwq> http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/5/
[08:34:25] <bwq> what's wrong with this?
[08:34:28] <quicksilver> and you supply a selector paramter to on
[08:34:43] <quicksilver> the documentation to on() is quite long and explains this in some detail.
[08:34:46] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:34:55] <chrisinajar> bwq: you never hook onto the event after adding the element
[08:35:12] <Know1edge1> bwq:  this works http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/7/
[08:35:30] <joris__> Hi. Can I do CDXHR if I don't do any POST and just want to retrieve an RSS feed with it?
[08:35:31] <bwq> yeah but that's not what i'm trying to do :p
[08:35:32] <AdvoWork> has jquery got a way to be able to download images that are linked somehow? ie if ive got 1.pdf, 2.pdf, 3.pdf linked(from a folder or something) can jquery allow me to download all of these some how?
[08:35:36] <bwq> quicksilver knows what i'm trying to do
[08:35:37] <joris__> Trying to use $.get() here
[08:35:50] <joris__> $.ajax() actually
[08:36:13] <bwq> do you have a short example of that, quicksilver?
[08:36:15] <sadmicrowave> bwq, Know1edge1 is right, add your event handler function in your append()
[08:36:18] <quicksilver> bwq: you want $(document).on('click','.whatever', function() { ... })
[08:36:34] <Know1edge1> ah attach it to the document, yeah
[08:36:47] <quicksilver> if you're happy with code being called on every single click
[08:36:58] <quicksilver> which is fine if you don't have 1000s and 1000s of handlers
[08:37:10] <quicksilver> but really just read the docs for .on and .live and .delegate and draw your own conclusions.
[08:37:34] <Know1edge1> bwq:  http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/8/
[08:37:36] <Eviltwin> But don't use .live
[08:37:43] <Know1edge1> quicksilver: ^^
[08:38:02] <bwq> sorry Know1edge1, i didn't see you used .on chained on the appended content
[08:38:16] <quicksilver> Eviltwin: yes, I meant read the docs for .live because it explains how to use .on instead :) Not with the intention of actually using .live.
[08:38:48] <Know1edge1> bwq: secondarily look at http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/8/
[08:39:09] <sadmicrowave> bwq, does this work? http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/11/
[08:42:36] <bwq> yup Know1edge1
[08:42:38] <bwq> hmm sadmicrowave
[08:42:42] <bwq> nothing happens when i run that
[08:43:41] <chrisinajar> for all it's worth, this is mine...

[08:43:51] <jeffsmykil> does juery have issues with the <tbody> tag?
[08:44:10] <xrated> jeffsmykil: what are you trying to do with it?
[08:44:13] <Eviltwin> It does something special with tbodies I think
[08:44:19] <jeffsmykil> trying to add odd and even
[08:44:22] <jeffsmykil> to my tr
[08:44:27] <jeffsmykil> but it only finds the first one
[08:44:41] <bwq> ah cool
[08:44:44] <xrated> You wanna fiddle it
[08:44:49] <bwq> you first add the handler and then add it to the dom
[08:44:53] <andrew91831> is there a solution to fix console.logs when some of my browsers dont have console
[08:44:59] <andrew91831> and i don't want to go through and remove each one ?
[08:45:04] <bwq> don't worry guys, in the end .live() works just fine!
[08:45:07] <chrisinajar> bwq: yup, make sense?
[08:45:09] <bwq> j/k :v
[08:45:12] <bwq> yup
[08:45:16] <xrated> andrew91831, you can check for console.log and create it if it doesn't exist
[08:45:20] <chrisinajar> cool. i tried to make the code really clear...
[08:45:55] <andrew91831> ah okay.  so i can just do if (console === undefined) { console = { alert('blah'); } ?
[08:46:08] <xrated> more or less.
[08:46:13] <andrew91831> kk thanks

[08:50:00] <bot-t> chrisinajar, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:50:32] <chrisinajar> So I have a page that works on all browsers on all computers tested but one. One of my co-workers  entire IE8 window freezes for a solid 45 seconds when loading this page, which i believe is being caused  by his virus scanner. This site is the only one it does it to, and only his computer does it. we have other computers with the same OS/browser/scanner combo that do not have the issue, so there could be another variable here, but nonet
[08:50:40] <chrisinajar> Eviltwin: i know, i was typing
[08:51:03] <chrisinajar> Eviltwin: any troubleshooting tips?
[08:51:10] <garrensmith> anyone looking for jquery/javascript freelancers
[08:51:25] <chrisinajar> garrensmith: this isn't a recruiting channel
[08:51:43] <andrew91831> chrisinajar: how do you suppose we troubleshoot your problem when we don't have his/her config ?
[08:51:44] <garrensmith> chrisinajar: sorry. Didn't mean it in that way.
[08:52:03] <chrisinajar> andrew91831: i don't, hence the "troubleshooting tips"
[08:53:05] <andrew91831> if you can't recreate the problem, its difficult to test
[08:53:09] <Eviltwin> Did you see ?ftj
[08:53:09] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:53:29] <sadmicrowave> bwq, I know you've moved on by now but for what it's worth, I've got this: http://jsfiddle.net/QQ2Ap/16/  jsfiddle doesn't seem to like the getJSON so you can implement it on your own page if you wish
[08:53:30] <chrisinajar> andrew91831: i can recreate the problem 100% reliably. perhaps you should reread what i wrote.
[08:53:52] <bwq> haha thanks :D
[08:53:54] <andrew91831> recreate it in different environments ?
[08:53:58] <andrew91831> on different computers ?
[08:54:20] <bwq> yeah, adding the .on() handler when creating the new object seems the way to go
[08:54:38] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: of course it works in my jsfiddle :-p
[08:55:15] <chrisinajar> andrew91831: so what you're saying is that the answer to my question was "no".
[08:55:22] <bwq> hmm
[08:55:33] <bwq> say i modify the css of something when i click on it
[08:55:48] <bwq> and later on, i want to change the css back to the original state
[08:55:49] <sadmicrowave> 'you modify the css of something when you click on it'
[08:55:53] <sadmicrowave> oh
[08:56:00] <bwq> how would i store that object?
[08:56:10] <bwq> i'm using var currentObject = $(this);
[08:56:13] <john____> bwq: put the css into a 'class', then add and remove the class
[08:56:15] <bwq> but i can't use it in other functions
[08:56:41] <bwq> hmm
[08:56:42] <sadmicrowave> john____++
[08:56:47] <bwq> is there nothing more straight forward for this?
[08:56:52] <andrew91831> you can use toggleClass
[08:56:57] <john____> that's pretty straight forward...
[08:56:59] <andrew91831> it's pretty easy
[08:57:05] <bwq> i know it's easy
[08:57:17] <sadmicrowave> bwq, but toggleClass still requires the styling to be put in classes and adding and removing that class
[08:57:19] <bwq> just feels weird having to create a whole new class just for this
[08:57:43] <NoiseEee> bwq: why, its a visual style in your document....
[08:58:06] <andrew91831> right on NoiseEee
[08:58:24] <bwq> i mean in the sense that it'd be more straight forward when you were able to just store that object
[08:58:42] <john____> wat
[08:58:47] <chrisinajar> bwq: use classes to do it. that's why they're there. what's what they do.
[08:58:48] <bwq> let's just disregard the visual stuff, say i want to do something else with it later on
[08:58:54] <bwq> how would i access it then?
[08:58:58] <chrisinajar> store it
[08:58:59] <john____> STORE ALL THE OBJECTZ
[08:59:01] <bwq> :D
[08:59:10] <chrisinajar> give it an id and look it up by that later?
[08:59:13] <NoiseEee> bwq: straight forward to whom?  you think its straight forward for the next person to find out where in gods name that style is being defined?  they shouldn't have to look in JS to find style info.
[08:59:14] <chrisinajar> store it in a variable?
[08:59:43] <bwq> yeah, i figured var currSel = $(this); would work
[08:59:46] <bwq> but alas :p
[08:59:52] <bwq> gonna give it an id yeah
[08:59:56] <chrisinajar> it does. if it doesn't then you're using it wrong.
[09:00:16] <chrisinajar> what is likely is that you're not understanding scope properly, which fortunately there are lots and lots of documents online on :)
[09:00:35] <bwq> i'm using currentSel.css({'font-weight': 'normal'});
[09:00:37] <sadmicrowave> put the object in 'the Cloud' (the infamous catch all black-hole of everything IT related) and magically get the object back when needed.
[09:00:44] <sadmicrowave> :)
[09:00:49] <chrisinajar> bwq: don't. use classes
[09:01:04] <john____> oh boy
[09:01:15] <bwq> k
[09:01:22] <EdwardIII> hey
[09:01:27] <chrisinajar> hi
[09:01:29] <sadmicrowave> hi
[09:01:34] <andrew91831> bonjour
[09:01:36] <bwq> any advantages when using a class instead of just changing the id and going by that?
[09:01:58] <john____> classes are symantically meant to be re used
[09:02:00] <john____> id's are not
[09:02:04] <NoiseEee> bwq: yes, the people who work with your code or take over your code don't have to pore through JS to find where a visual style is being defined
[09:02:26] <bwq> :D

[09:04:39] <EdwardIII> chrisinajar, sadmicrowave, andrew91831, greetings!
[09:04:45] <EdwardIII> i want my pink box to slide out of the viewport: http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/
[09:04:56] <EdwardIII> and i want to use css3 transitions rather than just a normal animate() call so it can be mobile friendly
[09:05:23] <EdwardIII> now i can't leave my position:fixed left and right settings on there because they overwrite the .clicked class
[09:05:47] <EdwardIII> but i can't set them to inherit either
[09:06:28] <stribor> i am having trouble loading pfd file that can be accessed using URL....i am doing it like this -> $(""+elementSelector+"").load(""+sourceUrl+"");
[09:07:17] <chrisinajar> stribor: you don't need those ""+ things, they're doing nothing
[09:07:46] <stribor> chrisinajar: thanks/...but even without it it loads bunch of binary data instead of pdf
[09:08:00] <sadmicrowave> EdwardIII, I'm not familiar enough with css3 transitions but wouldn't you want to apply the css transition properties to the #container element rather than #bye if you wanted the entire pink box to float out?
[09:09:18] <stribor> chrisinajar: if i type URL of this pdf file it works fine and it shows me my pdf...but using load() function shows bunch of binary data
[09:09:23] <sadmicrowave> EdwardIII, nevermind, sorry I see whats going on now
[09:09:35] <chrisinajar> stribor: probvably because pdf's are a bunch of binary...
[09:10:00] <stribor> chrisinajar: i knoq but id like to actually see the file same way as if i would type that url in the browser
[09:10:07] <gracias> hey, i don't get it..is this bad syntac? $('#xxx, #foo').find('#test');?
[09:10:12] <gracias> *syntax
[09:10:17] <chrisinajar> stribor: pdf != html. you can't do that without use of a browser plugin.
[09:10:45] <chrisinajar> gracias: why not just do $("#test")?
[09:10:52] <stribor> chrisinajar: can you give me any suggestions on how to fix  this problem
[09:11:00] <chrisinajar> stribor: don't use pdf's
[09:11:10] <chrisinajar> stribor: or just link to them
[09:11:25] <stribor> chrisinajar: i have to be able to view them in the broswer
[09:11:29] <Guest80533> jkljlasd
[09:11:32] <Guest80533> ok
[09:11:35] <chrisinajar> stribor: or you could google 'jquery embed pdf' and see if you get anything golden
[09:11:44] <EdwardIII> hey, got disco
[09:11:52] <chrisinajar> stribor: if not, then you're going to have to ammend what you 'have to' do :P
[09:11:54] <EdwardIII> didn't miss some amazing solution someone had posted by any chance?
[09:12:32] <stribor> chrisinajar: thanks
[09:12:58] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: Did you make a jsFiddle?
[09:13:42] <supsup> Edward
[09:13:42] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/1/
[09:13:48] <supsup> just a guess
[09:14:09] <supsup> ur trying to do ur transition on an anchor tag so i made it go to it's parent
[09:14:39] <chrisinajar> "deepskyblue"
[09:14:42] <chrisinajar> wtf is this shit.
[09:15:59] <sadmicrowave> chrisinajar, lol
[09:16:00] <supsup> you have never watched Deep blue a shark eats Jackson
[09:16:13] <supsup> thats what deepskyblue is named for i think in honor of the shark
[09:16:23] <chrisinajar> probably, yes.
[09:16:26] <sadmicrowave> supsup, not jackson?
[09:16:28] <chrisinajar> i think that's the most logical.
[09:16:31] <supsup> o
[09:16:35] <supsup> i can't remember who it eats
[09:16:46] <sadmicrowave> yea, who wants to honor him
[09:17:23] <slashdot1> hope the shark didn't get sick
[09:17:32] <chrisinajar> that would be really sad...
[09:17:36] <slashdot1> i'd cry
[09:17:39] <chrisinajar> i hope he's ok
[09:17:40] <supsup> naw that's protein
[09:17:42] * chrisinajar prays
[09:17:45] <supsup> he got swole
[09:17:56] <slashdot1> i bet it burned the next day
[09:17:56] <gracias> $("#x,#y").find('#z').live('click', function() {            || guess what will happen? the function is executed on clicking #x...why is that?
[09:18:26] <NoiseEee> gracias: event bubbling.
[09:18:38] <gracias> NoiseEee: what's that?
[09:18:47] <NoiseEee> gracias: google "javascript event bubbling"
[09:19:00] <NoiseEee> gracias: every parent gets the event of its child, for the most part
[09:19:08] <sadmicrowave> EdwardIII, well I've tried my hand at this for too long, I don't know css3 yet and am not going to learn right now...
[09:19:40] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, i'm picking and choosing what i learn extremely discretely anymore... time flies
[09:19:53] <gracias> NoiseEee: that's not the default behavious with the parent thing?
[09:20:04] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, indeed, just picked up python on my list, getting pretty good at it :)
[09:20:12] <NoiseEee> gracias: thats fundamental to how javascript and the DOM work
[09:20:12] <slashdot1> i had fun @ python
[09:20:21] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, what are you doing with it?
[09:20:24] <slashdot1> (python)
[09:20:31] <slashdot1> (not YOUR python)
[09:20:31] <sadmicrowave> lol
[09:20:36] <slashdot1> but PYTHON.org
[09:20:38] <slashdot1> o.0
[09:20:47] <gracias> NoiseEee: if i do $('#x).click(function....no parent of #x will get the handler..
[09:21:30] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: i did!
[09:21:33] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: but my damn machine crashed
[09:21:39] <sadmicrowave> I made a directory listener with pyinotify to listen for incoming files created from another program, parse the contents into a mysql table and delete the file afterwards.
[09:21:42] <EdwardIII> ah, there it is: http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/
[09:21:45] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, ^
[09:22:14] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, reminmds me of an item i have on my list
[09:22:17] <slashdot1> ipn
[09:22:19] <slashdot1> listener
[09:23:01] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, yea, it was a pretty simple starter project but helped learned the in's and out's of python pretty quickly
[09:23:06] <sadmicrowave> -ed
[09:23:06] <NoiseEee> gracias: they won't get the handler, but they most certainly will get the event.
[09:23:25] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, if you want to venture out, look @bottlepy.org
[09:23:33] <slashdot1> tight little framework for web
[09:23:38] <slashdot1> works well with jquery/javascript
[09:24:01] <EdwardIII> i've just started using django actually
[09:24:13] <slashdot1> django used to be awesome
[09:24:15] <EdwardIII> planning to develop something with django+piston+backbone.js+jquery
[09:24:16] <slashdot1> it's good now
[09:24:17] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, saw twisted for an event driver (web applicable) framework, but that looks like a can of worms :/
[09:24:22] <EdwardIII> slashdot1: where did the awesome go?
[09:24:36] <EdwardIII> heh i guess it's all about the node.js
[09:24:45] <slashdot1> EdwardIII, read the history of django. by the time you get to 'now' it's like a jenga tower of stacked apps
[09:24:54] <NoiseEee> gracias: in your case if you use .on() (1.7+) your handler could be re-written as $("#x,#y").on('click', '#z',function() { //now only #z will fire this }
[09:25:11] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, i stayed pure for the most part in python
[09:25:16] <slashdot1> used json/xml
[09:25:21] <slashdot1> oracle back end
[09:25:39] <slashdot1> jquery for evaluating items into the dom
[09:26:02] <slashdot1> soz... the extreme frameworks  were only used if no other choice
[09:26:06] <slashdot1> but twisted is a beast i hear
[09:26:08] <slashdot1> :-D
[09:26:31] <EdwardIII> twisted is all about event-driven long-poll type stuff right?
[09:26:34] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, yea, it's got some awesome power but damn its involved
[09:26:44] <supsup> EdwardIII: i'm guessing i misunderstood the problem with this solution: http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/1/
[09:26:46] <sadmicrowave> EdwardIII, thats what she said
[09:26:54] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, imho, twisted is it's own subject
[09:27:08] <gracias> NoiseEee: thank you, but i don't understand, why the context or find-thing does not work. could swear, it worked all the time
[09:27:43] <EdwardIII> supsup: no i don't think so, it looks awesome
[09:27:48] <EdwardIII> supsup: just trying to spot the diff
[09:27:56] <supsup> .parent()
[09:28:02] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, right, really disappointed in the #python room lately.  Went in with a problem regarding sockets and I was immediately told to use twisted or some other framework
[09:28:05] <supsup> you are changing css on the Anchor tag
[09:28:19] <EdwardIII> huh
[09:28:29] <supsup> $(this) is the anchor tag
[09:28:33] <EdwardIII> sadmicrowave: i guess no one wants to help you reinvent the wheel
[09:28:38] <supsup> so i changed it to it's parent
[09:28:49] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, it's always been that way there
[09:28:53] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, when I explained that I was using sockets for a learning project so I could learn the basics of port connections I got the response: Don't learn the basics, use the framwework
[09:29:17] <EdwardIII> sadmicrowave: or pull the framework apart to see how it does it
[09:29:17] <supsup> or rather i went up to it's parent
[09:29:25] <Dr4g_> evening !
[09:29:26] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, it's kind of mob mentality in there... lots of talent, but people end up parroting what the rest of the room wont trash them out over
[09:29:36] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, like "PEER LEARNING" i guess?
[09:29:59] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, yea, not the best way to learn
[09:30:06] <sadmicrowave> IMO
[09:30:12] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, the guy who wrote twisted is in there
[09:30:14] <slashdot1> mgw?
[09:30:16] <slashdot1> something like that
[09:30:20] <slashdot1> brilliant dude
[09:30:25] <sadmicrowave> i bet
[09:30:30] <slashdot1> but sometimes people need to learn before they use twisted
[09:30:52] <slashdot1> ok sadmicrowave bafck to work for a bit
[09:30:53] <slashdot1> ttyl
[09:30:57] <sadmicrowave> later
[09:31:38] <sadmicrowave> slashdot1, for what its worth, bottlepy looks nice
[09:31:49] <supsup> EdwardIII: pretty sure the first css altering is uneeded as well: http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/2/
[09:31:52] <slashdot1> sadmicrowave, for what it's worth, it never fails
[09:31:58] <sadmicrowave> :)
[09:32:00] <slashdot1> (seriously)
[09:32:03] <slashdot1> like a caged monster
[09:33:02] <ravenzz> supsup you don't need the inherit properties
[09:33:07] <supsup> EdwardIII: clean version: http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/4/  -- u had .ready twice, since
[09:33:17] <supsup> your using jsfiddle onload jquery
[09:33:33] <supsup> ravenzz not sure what u mean -- this is not my example.
[09:33:40] <supsup> or rather original code
[09:33:59] <Eviltwin> supsup: Yet uou neglected to hit the TidyUp button...for shame
[09:34:02] <ravenzz> supsup http://pastie.org/3196218
[09:34:03] <EdwardIII> supsup: ah
[09:34:10] <EdwardIII> hrm
[09:34:12] * EdwardIII is confused 
[09:34:18] <ericandrewlewis> has anyone sorted multiple tables at once?
[09:34:21] <EdwardIII> supsup: you're making #container position: fixed, right?
[09:34:34] <ravenzz> also replace that return false with e.preventDefault();
[09:34:38] <ericandrewlewis> i essentially ahve one big table split into multiple tables and need to sort them all
[09:34:53] <supsup> ravenzz heh i took that out, why use e.preventDefault?
[09:35:05] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ supsup
[09:35:06] <bot-t> supsup, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:35:13] <EdwardIII> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/arc93/5/
[09:35:16] <supsup> yah but i thought return false does the same thing
[09:35:37] <supsup> EdwardIII  hah.
[09:36:21] <polerin> Anyone have resouces about best practices for using jquery as a web api consumer?
[09:36:30] <supsup> EdwardIII I don't know much about css3z was just guesses mostly ~~
[09:36:36] <EdwardIII> supsup: ah
[09:36:38] <polerin> or "what not to do" examples XD
[09:36:41] <EdwardIII> supsup: if you take it out of JSfiddle
[09:36:48] <EdwardIII> supsup: then it doesn't work, thus the position:fixed
[09:37:07] <supsup> out of jsfiddle you need to add abck your on ready event
[09:37:22] <EdwardIII> supsup: i need the element to be position:fixed to get started, but then i need it to not be position:fixed when i change the class
[09:37:29] * EdwardIII tinkers
[09:37:33] <EdwardIII> supsup: sure, done that
[09:37:46] <supsup> yah not sure - i need to look into css3 tho it appears ;-0
[09:38:10] <ravenzz> anyway supsup, do you need jquery just to do that?
[09:38:15] <EdwardIII> supsup: well it's not really to do with css3
[09:38:19] <EdwardIII> exactly
[09:38:25] <supsup> ravenzz it's Edwards problem not mine
[09:39:15] <EdwardIII> i basically need to say top: "remove whatever jquery has added into the style="" tag"
[09:39:43] <EdwardIII> top: inherit doesn't seem to do the job
[09:40:16] <ravenzz> lol
[09:41:01] <kanzie> if I have a list of li-elements each with unique id and I want to addClass to all elements preceding element X, how do I go about that?
[09:41:16] <Eviltwin> .prevAll
[09:41:30] <Eviltwin> ?.prevAll @ kanzie
[09:41:30] <bot-t> kanzie, .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
[09:41:30] <supsup> ? lt
[09:41:30] <bot-t> :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[09:42:02] <supsup> nice prevAll i never use that ;-<
[09:42:03] <Eviltwin> Don't think .lt will work for this
[09:42:23] <supsup> it could but u would have to do more work i think ...
[09:42:23] <alakazeem> is it possible to show an mp4 video fullscreen on smartphones and then with the on end event go to an url?
[09:42:27] <Eviltwin> $("#myelement").prevAll() will get all the siblings before #myelement
[09:42:31] <supsup> yah
[09:42:32] <supsup> thats hot
[09:43:05] <supsup> i would of found current index then used lt....sloppy ;/
[09:43:26] <Eviltwin> Extremely sloppy :P
[09:44:08] <jeffsmykil> where the fuck is the page zoom in FF for Windows 7
[09:44:13] <jeffsmykil> cant find a damn thing in windows 7
[09:44:27] <supsup> hold down control and use your mouse wheel
[09:44:47] <jeffsmykil> yeah i needed to reset
[09:44:49] <jeffsmykil> thanks though
[09:44:58] <supsup> thats not windows fault either it's firefox
[09:45:02] <supsup> they keep changing their ui
[09:45:03] <polerin> jeffsmykil: control+0
[09:45:11] <jeffsmykil> its still infuriating
[09:45:20] <polerin> cntrl+0 is reset :)
[09:45:21] <jeffsmykil> one of the reason i use macs always know where the menu bar is
[09:45:32] <supsup> i use everything ~~
[09:50:19] <EdwardIII> joel spolski says good things about the mac menu bar
[09:50:25] <EdwardIII> AND about the winamp snap-to-sides-of-window feature
[09:50:42] <jeffsmykil> EdwardIII: i DO LIKE wINDOWS 7 SNAP FEATURE
[09:50:46] <EdwardIII> right, come up with a work around - work within container using position: absolute, not within the viewport using position: fixed, take the rest of the day off
[09:50:47] <jeffsmykil> Oh wow
[09:50:50] <jeffsmykil> apologie
[09:50:51] <jeffsmykil> s
[09:50:54] <EdwardIII> jeffsmykil: yeah plus win+left, win+right = lovelyness
[09:51:01] <EdwardIII> not as lovely as xmonad, but an improvement
[09:51:22] <jeffsmykil> didnt know about that one
[09:51:24] <jeffsmykil> very nice
[09:51:34] <EdwardIII> right, toodles all
[09:51:44] <jeffsmykil> moom on the mac mimics it
[09:51:47] <jeffsmykil> fyi
[10:03:48] <shadykhan> anyone know of a good jquery slider with good captions that i can customize to the extreme?
[10:13:00] <gho5t> Am I right in thinking that if I have an element such as <div id="foo" data-height="300"> that I need to read this value using $('#foo').attr('data-height') instead of using $('#foo').data('height') ?
[10:14:19] <chee> hey. if i have a collection of <li>s called .nav-1 to .nav-7, and a collection of divs called .page-1 to .page-7, is there a way of making it so clicking .nav-4 will show .page-4 without having to write an individual block of code for every .nav- ?
[10:15:14] <alakazeem> when i do something like $("video").bind("ended", function() { 	   window.open('http://www.google.com'); 	}); how can i prevent pop up blockers and stuff?
[10:15:26] <jac0bz1> Is there a way to count what "level" an LI is on? Like if i want to figure out that "third child" is number three? MARKUP: <ul><li>First<ul><li>Child of first<ul><li>Third child</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
[10:16:07] <vladbo> hi guys. I'm trying to chain a fadeToggle() after a fadeOut that is applied to a collection of elements (and can't just pass a callback to fadeOut as it would be called multiple times). I've tried queues but haven't been able to get a working solutions. any ideas?
[10:16:57] <jac0bz1> chee: Use wildcard.. $("[class^=nav-]")
[10:18:56] <nardev> hello, i have one trivial question how to divide two variables (both double/float values)
[10:19:13] <gho5t> Am I right in thinking that if I have an element such as <div id="foo" data-height="300"> that I need to read this value using $('#foo').attr('data-height') instead of using $('#foo').data('height') ?
[10:19:27] <gho5t> nardev: /
[10:21:28] <red_square> jac0bz1 not easily - you could count the parent ul's I guess
[10:21:49] <nardev> gho5t, read about selectors
[10:21:50] <TehRabbitt> hopefully someone can help me... i've run into an issue where just simply including jQuery into a website that I need to modify, breaks half the site because it's using "JBoss RichFaces" all i've found on the topic is this: https://community.jboss.org/thread/152146
[10:22:02] <jac0bz1> red_square: I've played with index() but not with any great results
[10:22:13] <gho5t> nardev: that doesn't really help at all
[10:22:14] <red_square> they are not siblings jac0bz1
[10:22:37] <red_square> ? .data @ gho5t
[10:22:37] <bot-t> gho5t, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:22:39] <TehRabbitt> the simple inclusion of the jQuery script breaks everything :-\
[10:23:02] <nardev> gho5t, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7177512/jquery-get-value-of-custom-attribute
[10:23:08] <jac0bz1> any other ideas for this approche: I have a drop down navigation, for each "level" the menu goes deeper, i want to add the class "level-X" to the UL.
[10:23:17] <gho5t> nardev: where did i ask how to get the value
[10:23:31] <gho5t> i mentioned 2 ways to get the value and asked if they were equivalent
[10:23:37] <nardev> TehRabbitt, try to search for initializing jquery or existing pre jquery javascript via different instance
[10:23:50] <TehRabbitt> hm
[10:23:57] <nardev> gho5t, i'm sorry
[10:24:01] <nardev> my mistake
[10:26:10] <red_square> jac0bz1 just use a .each to get all the ul's, each exposes a key they should get selected in child order
[10:26:18] <Whirl3d> is it bad form to use a number as a property of an object to simulate an array structure? In other words: var CONTROLS={}; CONTROLS.TAB=8; CONTROLS.8="tab";  (or CONTROLS[8]='tab')...or is this just bad in general?
[10:26:21] <gho5t> i think i see the problem. jquery will ignore any dashes and make the data- name camel case. e.g. data-my-height = $('#foo').data('myHeight')
[10:26:26] <TehRabbitt> nardev: i'm a bit confused, jquery is already being initialized by RichFaces yet I can't use it without defining jQuery?  (if I Include jQuery, my jQuery code works, but the RichFaces code breaks, if I remove the <script> include for jQuery, jQuery code breaks, but RichFaces works)
[10:27:58] <TehRabbitt> Hm so I should *NOT* be placing jQuery in <HEAD> ?
[10:28:21] <mantas322> I hate illegal tokens
[10:28:31] <mantas322> so far its the most frusterating jquery bug
[10:30:10] <TehRabbitt> okay now it doesnt work :-\
[10:30:12] <TehRabbitt> i'm so confused
[10:30:18] <TehRabbitt>   <script type="text/javascript" src="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/jquery.js"></script>
[10:30:18] <TehRabbitt>   <script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/DYMO.Label.Framework.1.2.4.js"></script>
[10:30:18] <TehRabbitt>   <script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/PrintLabel.js"></script>
[10:30:21] <red_square> wtf is richfaces
[10:30:28] <red_square> ? paste @ TehRabbitt
[10:30:29] <bot-t> TehRabbitt, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:30:36] <TehRabbitt> sorry
[10:30:49] <TehRabbitt> red_square: http://richfaces-showcase.appspot.com/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=inputNumberSpinner&skin=blueSky
[10:30:54] <TehRabbitt> i have no idea how to use RichFaces
[10:31:05] <TehRabbitt> but its what they are using since the site is made in JSF
[10:31:21] <red_square> oh, poor u
[10:31:26] <TehRabbitt> I need to add functionality that I need to use jQuery for, but I can't get jQuery working
[10:31:35] <TehRabbitt> because it kills their existing stuff
[10:33:13] <red_square> so rischfaces already uses jquery
[10:33:37] <TehRabbitt> red_square: apparently, yes...  but i have no way of accessing it
[10:33:45] <red_square> eh
[10:34:10] <soc42> hi #jquery
[10:34:12] <soc42> i am working on jquery events for some divs
[10:34:13] <red_square> on that site window.jQuery works fine
[10:34:16] <soc42> but the mouseleave event does not work as expected on a div, because i want to close the div its while onMouseleave
[10:34:18] <soc42> do you know how to workaround?
[10:34:25] <TehRabbitt> red_square: well i'm using $
[10:34:31] <red_square> $ works also
[10:34:37] <red_square> test it in the console on that site
[10:34:47] <Whirl3d> ?paste @soc42
[10:34:47] <bot-t> soc42, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:34:50] <red_square> unless someone doing your site has overwritten $
[10:34:56] <red_square> which I doubt
[10:35:16] <TehRabbitt> red_square: well all I know is I get a JS error when I include jQuery
[10:35:34] <red_square> you dont need to - richfaces already bundles it
[10:35:40] <red_square> as far as I can see
[10:35:56] <red_square> paste your html without your jquery script tag
[10:36:10] <TehRabbitt> red_square: i'm pastebinning everything one sec
[10:37:07] <TehRabbitt> red_square: this is "template.xhtml" http://paste.debian.net/152468/
[10:37:42] <red_square> so they already have jquery there
[10:37:43] <TehRabbitt> red_square: this is "auditMonitor.xhtml"
[10:37:44] <TehRabbitt> http://paste.debian.net/152470/
[10:37:53] <TehRabbitt> red_square: I added jquery to template.xhtml
[10:38:03] <TehRabbitt> along with my dymo and printLabel.js
[10:38:23] <red_square> ok, so when you rip out your jquery include
[10:38:26] <red_square> does $ work
[10:38:36] <ramkam001> anyone could help on this ? i get the two icons superposed, but they shouldn't according to the documentation, http://jsfiddle.net/R9mKG/
[10:38:39] <red_square> your server framework may inject it automatically
[10:38:39] <soc42> well, seems like i have some conflicting trouble on the development page, because while pasting the code, it works?! http://jsfiddle.net/zccBr/
[10:40:34] <TehRabbitt> red_square: i'm looking into that one sec
[10:42:00] <Whirl3d> Does anyone have a link to a set of defined constants for KeyCodes?   Something like var KEYCODES={}; KEYCODES.TAB=8; KEYCODES.BACK=9;   and so forth?
[10:42:48] <TehRabbitt> red_square: these are the errors I get when I include jQuery:
[10:42:48] <TehRabbitt> obj is undefineddo{if(obj.id==id) calendar.js.jsf (line 98)element.dispatchEvent is not a functionevent.eventName=eventName;event.memo=m...nt.fireEvent(event.eventType,event);} a4j_3_...ipt.jsf (line 250)
[10:44:14] <TehRabbitt> red_square: any idea why it would do that when I add jQuery?
[10:44:20] <red_square> TehRabbitt yeah we know it errors, what about when you dont add it
[10:44:27] <red_square> I need to see if it is already included
[10:44:40] <ramkam001> Whirl3d: http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html
[10:46:04] <TehRabbitt> $("monitorAudit:j_id74").component is undefined{var handler=new Function('event',"$('...e);if(!this.params.enableManualInput)
[10:46:14] <TehRabbitt> I think i broke something else along the way :-\
[10:46:50] <ramkam001> Whirl3d: and yes, you can do var keycodes = { tab: 8, enter: 13, ... }
[10:47:02] <red_square> TehRabbitt is that when you removed the jquery include that you added
[10:47:07] <TehRabbitt> one second
[10:47:23] <red_square> sheesh
[10:47:36] <TehRabbitt> red_square: my browser keeps caching the page
[10:47:52] <red_square> shift f5 to cache bust
[10:47:59] <red_square> if your on winx
[10:48:10] <sarspazam> shift f5?
[10:48:12] <TehRabbitt> red_square: unless the server is caching it :-\ it still hasn't chagned
[10:48:14] <sarspazam> isn't it control f5?
[10:48:27] <red_square> no
[10:48:50] <red_square> well they may do the same thing sarspazam
[10:49:09] <sarspazam> I don't trust ctrl f5 anymore
[10:49:19] <sarspazam> ctrl shift delete to clear all tempary files
[10:49:21] <red_square> shift f5 works
[10:49:33] <sarspazam> espcially with chromes caching
[10:49:52] <shadykhan> can someone help me with orbit slider the caption isnt showing up properly
[10:51:38] <TehRabbitt> okay the server *has* to be caching it somehow
[10:52:45] <_ferry> hi all, i have a doubt. How i can download a crystal report using jquery? I'm using $.ajax() method, and i dont obtain the return.
[10:53:35] <red_square> _ferry have you checked if the request gets there and returns
[10:56:28] <TehRabbitt> Okay
[10:56:33] <TehRabbitt> I removed jQuery this was the result
[10:56:33] <TehRabbitt> $.get is not a function			}, "text"); PrintLabel.js (line 34)
[10:56:54] <red_square> so in the console TehRabbitt type in window.jQuery
[10:57:08] <TehRabbitt> http://pastebin.com/5DxyrV9H
[10:57:34] <TehRabbitt> red_square: I did, and it returned function()
[10:57:44] <red_square> so jquery is defined
[10:57:49] <red_square> and already included
[10:58:24] <_ferry> red_square yes, the request hit the server and return, but i dont get my pdf or excel :(
[11:00:07] <red_square> u cant _ferry from an ajax call
[11:00:24] <red_square> just do a normal get request
[11:03:02] <TehRabbitt> red_square: so why the error that $.get is not a function then :-\
[11:03:09] <TehRabbitt> $.get is not a function			}, "text");
[11:03:20] <TehRabbitt> $.get('AITLabel.xml', function(labelXml)              {             label = dymo.label.framework.openLabelXml(labelXml);             }, "text");
[11:03:56] <vladbo> gonna try again. any ideas for chaining a fadeToggle to a fadeOut that is applied to a collection of elements?
[11:04:47] <_ferry> ok red_square, what kind of call should i do? one json i.e.?
[11:04:56] <TehRabbitt> red_square: maybe it's an old version of jQuery that has no support for $get?
[11:05:01] <TehRabbitt> (just a guess)
[11:05:06] <red_square> _ferry no just a normal call window.location = bla
[11:05:17] <chrisinajar> TehRabbitt: is jquery included? do console.log($); and see what it says. it should be a function/
[11:05:21] <red_square> TehRabbitt nope, get has been in forever
[11:06:29] <red_square> TehRabbitt paste the html as it is now
[11:06:39] <red_square> maybe jquery is included too late
[11:07:10] <TehRabbitt> http://pastebin.com/kN7dRuCP
[11:07:24] <TehRabbitt> thats the HTML that is generated by the JSF
[11:07:31] <TehRabbitt> (viewsource)
[11:09:48] <red_square> TehRabbitt dunno without seeing everything, stick a debugger at the top of that dyno script file and see what $ is when it gets parsed
[11:10:08] <TehRabbitt> red_square: okay one sec.
[11:10:53] <_ferry> via $.get i cant do it because i must change my charset.
[11:11:13] <red_square> _ferry it wont work with an ajax request
[11:11:48] <TehRabbitt> red_square: i'll add console.log($); to the code inside of onload() and i'll paste the console output
[11:12:02] <_ferry> i change my request, i try use $get and my string become codified like emiss%30co
[11:12:02] <panfist> hi, i was wondering if there was a shortcut if you're using something like the :checked selector, to get an array of the value attributes for each checked input?
[11:12:04] <jac0bz1> Any ideas on why this is not working recursive? http://jsfiddle.net/dvdPd/81/
[11:12:08] <chrisvwebdev> hello all
[11:12:26] <red_square> _ferry can you read what I type
[11:12:26] <chrisvwebdev> i have a problem with the jquery datepicker not storing the date value.
[11:12:52] <_ferry> red_square sorry.
[11:14:15] <red_square> panfist try $(":checkbox").serialize();
[11:14:53] <TehRabbitt> red_square: $ is not defined		console.log($);
[11:15:11] <TehRabbitt> when I placed it in printlabel.js
[11:15:26] <red_square> so is jquery 404'ing?
[11:15:40] <TehRabbitt> red_square: yes it is
[11:15:51] <TehRabbitt> "NetworkError: 404 /anything_it_dev/jquery.js - https://ait-web/anything_it_dev/jquery.js"jquery.js
[11:15:55] <red_square> ok thats why
[11:15:57] <timwis> Afternoon guys. I'm working on a jQuery Mobile app, and I have links within a page that change the content of that page. How can I adjust the URL so the back button works and my 'change content' function can be triggered when they press back?
[11:16:25] <red_square> jac0bz1 it is doing what you asked
[11:16:37] <red_square> children selects children
[11:16:41] <TehRabbitt> red_square: I put jquery.js back in the root dir that it's 404'ing about and this happens;
[11:16:43] <TehRabbitt> $("monitorAudit:j_id74").component is undefined{var handler=new Function('event',"$('...e);if(!this.params.enableManualInput)
[11:16:58] <TehRabbitt> aka it breaks RichFaces again
[11:17:56] <DofLeFou> i m trying to do something like this
[11:17:59] <DofLeFou> $("tbody#configsBody").append(row).fadeTo('slow', .3);
[11:18:12] <red_square> TehRabbitt what is component
[11:18:30] <DofLeFou> is there to fadeTo when doing an append?
[11:18:30] <TehRabbitt> red_square: it's a variable coming in from JSF which I have *no* idea
[11:18:39] <TehRabbitt>  red_square: that's a JSF error not JS
[11:18:52] <red_square> ok, all a bit of a mess really
[11:19:01] <TehRabbitt> red_square: yea I know :-\
[11:19:07] <red_square> get a jsf pro to help
[11:19:46] <TehRabbitt> red_square: well what has me confused, is why it won't work if jquery is included, yet when I remove it it does work, but the jquery part breaks
[11:20:23] <TehRabbitt> like if I delete jquery.js from the root, the dropdown RichFaces menu works
[11:20:27] <red_square> TehRabbitt I have no idea what your server framework is doing
[11:20:28] <TehRabbitt> (because jquery 404's)
[11:20:47] <red_square> but it sounds grim
[11:20:51] <red_square> and invasive
[11:21:05] <vladbo> fwiw, to this is how i chained a callback to a fadeOut applied to a collection of elements: http://jsfiddle.net/Sa59K/
[11:22:24] <panfist> red_square: thanks
[11:22:36] <panfist> that was exactly what i needed
[11:22:37] <mantas322> hey guys
[11:22:44] <mantas322> how do i link out of a jquerypage
[11:22:44] <red_square> panfist np
[11:22:47] <mantas322> ??
[11:22:55] <red_square> what
[11:22:59] <red_square> link out
[11:23:14] <red_square> what is a jquerypage
[11:23:16] <mantas322> wait a minute
[11:23:18] <NoiseEee> once you're linked in, you can never link out
[11:23:23] <red_square> haha
[11:23:37] <koulchilebaiz_> hi all, i would like to know how to add those buttons ? http://jsfiddle.net/DX6Eg/    what can i add or remove ? what is wrong ?
[11:23:38] <JAAulde> In a custom jQuery UI widget, if I override the `destroy` method (for example), then I should call `widget.prototype.destroy.apply(this, arguments);` within that override, correct?
[11:23:47] <mantas322> nevermind i solved my own nonsense
[11:23:48] <mantas322> sorry.
[11:23:59] <mantas322> LOL!
[11:24:06] <red_square> wait, what did you mean
[11:24:11] <mantas322> noiseEEe funny we just had issues with our office 360 email
[11:24:19] <mantas322> which has a feature for IM's called Linked in
[11:24:26] <mantas322> so your statements to unfortunatly true
[11:24:46] <mantas322> I was having my typical illegal token jquery exception
[11:24:56] <mantas322> but it was a problem with the page i was going TO not comming from
[11:25:15] <garbagegod> Hey guys I have a problem, I'm doing something along the lines of $("#div").fadeOut; $("#div").css('background', 'ff0000'); $("#div").fadeIn();
[11:25:25] <mantas322> however since jquery wont even navigate to the other page with the token illegality , i was convinced for a while tyhere was a problem with my link
[11:25:35] <garbagegod> And for some reason, the background always changes to #ff0000 BEFORE it actually fades out
[11:25:44] <dougb> does anyone know of any good resources about $().sortable('serialize')? for some reason, it's only sending the information for the item that was clicked
[11:25:48] <red_square> garbagegod use the callback
[11:25:51] <garbagegod> how can I make it not do that? I've been trying .delay but it still always happens before it fades out
[11:26:03] <garbagegod> How do I use the callback
[11:26:15] <red_square> $("#div").fadeOut('slow', function(){ //do shit });
[11:26:42] <red_square> that invokes the func after fadeOut has completed
[11:26:46] <garbagegod> nice
[11:26:47] <garbagegod> thanks
[11:26:49] <red_square> np
[11:29:03] <garbagegod> Can I nest callbacks, like use another function inside the callback for a function inside a callback?
[11:30:45] <jac0bz1> Yeah i know that red_square, but not what i want it to.. as i said, recursive...
[11:31:05] <red_square> ? .when @ garbagegod
[11:31:05] <bot-t> garbagegod, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[11:32:02] <garbagegod> thanks again
[11:32:40] <mantas322> NOOOOOOOO! Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:32:48] <mantas322> I swear
[11:32:59] <mantas322> 100% of my jquery errors are illegal token
[11:33:07] <NoiseEee> time to talk to a lawyer
[11:33:16] <mantas322> nyuk nyuk nyuk
[11:34:28] <rzec> any reason why when I do .serialize on a form, it converts spaces to +?
[11:35:08] <red_square> jac0bz1 it does recurse
[11:35:27] <red_square> just you have return before the console log so you dont see the no more
[11:35:43] <red_square> rzec so its url encoded

[11:37:35] <ravenzz> oh k
[11:37:44] <ravenzz> you can help guys here
[11:38:28] <roothewhirl> reading jQuery/JavaScript books, and hacking my way through code can only take me so far. just want to surround myself with a bunch of people smarter than I am and see if I can pick up on anything (yes, my motivations are still a bit selfish :D)
[11:41:28] <mantas322> when if
[11:41:39] <mantas322> what if I cache the jquery.js library
[11:41:44] <mantas322> what you guys think about that
[11:43:32] <Eviltwin> ?
[11:46:22] <devmikey> Question: Does hide() only work within a function?
[11:47:08] <vladbo> devmikey: nope
[11:47:53] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys
[11:48:09] <aclockworkpeter> this may be the wrong place to ask, but how do I make an image clear a text box
[11:48:25] <devmikey> So if I do <script>$('#someElement').hide()</script>, it should hide it?
[11:48:28] <kryl> hi
[11:48:29] <roothewhirl> use the css rule
[11:48:32] <roothewhirl> clear: both;
[11:48:41] <roothewhirl> or clear: right
[11:48:44] <red_square> devmikey depends where the script tag is in relation to jquery and the element
[11:48:46] <alexr2> $(img selector).click(function() { $(textbox selector).val('') });
[11:48:55] <alexr2> ^^ aclockworkpeter
[11:49:00] <kryl> Is it possible and interesting to use a php script that will combine all js to load in the header ?
[11:49:02] <devmikey> At the bottom, after </body>
[11:49:19] <aclockworkpeter> hmm... thanks
[11:49:45] <roothewhirl> aclockworkpeter, let me link you to a couple articles
[11:49:45] <red_square> devmikey never tried after body but it should work
[11:49:48] <NoiseEee> devmikey: no, not after </body>
[11:49:55] <roothewhirl> on float based layouts in css
[11:49:58] <NoiseEee> devmikey: before </body>
[11:50:00] <aclockworkpeter> sure thing roothewhirl
[11:50:11] <red_square> NoiseEee it should still parse and work, not valid but!
[11:50:12] <devmikey> just before it, you mean?
[11:50:25] <NoiseEee> devmikey: yes
[11:50:27] <roothewhirl> http://www.alistapart.com/articles/css-floats-101/
[11:50:39] <roothewhirl> read that aclockworkpeter
[11:50:49] <aclockworkpeter> ok I will
[11:50:51] <aclockworkpeter> thank you
[11:50:53] <roothewhirl> n/p
[11:52:25] <dogarrhea2> are there times when .css is ignored completely?
[11:52:32] <dogarrhea2> applying a new style and such
[11:52:46] <red_square> yeah during evenings and weekend dogarrhea2
[11:52:49] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea2: sure, if another rule has greater precendence
[11:52:51] <mantas322> lol
[11:53:07] <mantas322> buncha oliver hardys here
[11:53:11] <NoiseEee> s/precendence/precedence
[11:53:25] <dogarrhea2> he looks obese.
[11:53:41] <dogarrhea2> yea i'm having that kind of problem.. it's ignoring my calls to .css for background image
[11:53:56] <red_square> dogarrhea2 u can see in chrome debugger or firebug
[11:54:15] <red_square> what css is being applied and what is not due to higher order precedence
[11:54:28] <roothewhirl> dogarrhea2 i've heard that applying a class to the element via jQuery is a much better method than actually applying the CSS directly through jQuery. something you might want to look into
[11:54:45] <roothewhirl> and then obviously styling that class with the proper CSS rules
[11:55:08] <ravenzz> dogarrhea2 http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascade
[11:55:26] <ravenzz> don't use presentational classes
[11:55:37] <roothewhirl> of course not
[11:56:49] <roothewhirl> however, keeping the class name as "non-presentational" as possible, does give you further flexibility in dropping CSS hooks into it at a later time
[11:57:04] <roothewhirl> kind of the whole OOCSS thing (something I am not totally familiar with)
[12:02:21] <JAAulde> Using jQuery UI UI 1.8.14, I wrote a widget using the widget factory. In my `_create()` method, under certain conditions, I want to stop building and bail out.  I figured it would be good to call my `destroy()` method in this case to fully wipe out the thing I was abandoning. However it seems that calling `destory` from within `_create` has no effect. Any thoughts on how ot accmplish?
[12:02:37] <guy> wtf
[12:02:37] <guy> console.log( $('body') );
[12:02:41] <guy> doesn't select anything?
[12:02:55] <JAAulde> guy: what gets logged?
[12:02:59] <guy> []
[12:03:38] <roothewhirl> how much does jQuery's .css() method take precendence over the normal cacade rules of CSS? (IE is it more specific than !important? or is it treated with the same specificity as external CSS?)
[12:03:47] <JAAulde> I assume your document _has_ a body...?
[12:04:05] <mantas322> hmmm
[12:04:08] <JAAulde> roothewhirl: the CSS method apples directly to the element
[12:04:13] <mantas322> so im going to string replaces within my page
[12:04:17] <mantas322> on the back end
[12:04:20] <JAAulde> roothewhirl: like the `style` attr
[12:04:25] <mantas322> nevermind..
[12:04:26] <guy> Yes, sure
[12:04:26] <roothewhirl> JAAulde so it's treated as inline CSS?
[12:04:28] <guy> http://cameos.com/ JAAulde
[12:04:56] <JAAulde> roothewhirl: if by "inline CSS" you mean like an element's `style` attribute, then yes
[12:05:01] <mantas322> IS IT POSSIBLE that this control       <form id="logForm" onSubmit="return false;" method="post">         <input type="submit" onClick="saveLS2('#url.xmlid#')" value="Save for Offline">
[12:05:01] <roothewhirl> cool
[12:05:06] <mantas322> causes problems with jquery
[12:05:55] <megalomix> hello
[12:05:59] <mantas322> oh my
[12:06:02] <mantas322> looks like it is
[12:06:16] <JAAulde> guy: I see in the console that `[]` is logged at load.  Which file does this?  And is it being done at document.ready or later?
[12:06:16] <megalomix> is it possible to retrive all the checked checkboxes of a form ?
[12:06:57] <guy> JAAulde: Ignore. The issue was that I've tried console.log not inside $(function(){});
[12:06:59] <NoiseEee> megalomix: indeed, http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:07:06] <NoiseEee> megalomix: and http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[12:07:09] <JAAulde> guy: yep, just as I was asking. :)
[12:07:30] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys
[12:07:42] <aclockworkpeter> I'm trying to do something along the lines of: http://pastie.org/3197090
[12:08:20] <dougb> can IE not handle data returned as json?  I am doing a test where data is returned, and in chrome/FF if i do alert(d.status) i get 1 but in IE I get undefined
[12:08:39] <NoiseEee> dougb: are you sending headers that specify the data is JSON?
[12:08:42] <aclockworkpeter> but I don't understand - how does one find the keycode?
[12:08:54] <megalomix> $('#frmPackages input[type=checkbox]').is(':checked')
[12:08:55] <megalomix> ?
[12:09:14] <dougb> NoiseEee: in the $().ajax request I set dataType: 'json'...is that correct?
[12:09:15] <roothewhirl> megalomix something like var checkboxes = $("form :input:checkbox")
[12:09:24] <NoiseEee> megalomix: $('#frmPackages input:checked')
[12:09:27] <roothewhirl> sorry
[12:09:31] <roothewhirl> checkboxes = $("form input:checkbox")
[12:09:39] <JAAulde> ajpiano: ping (when you get a sec)
[12:09:46] <dougb> NoiseEee: oh wait i get what you're saying, the data from the server...no i haven't...i'll try that
[12:09:48] <roothewhirl> var checkboxes = $("form input:checkbox")
[12:09:59] <megalomix> roothewhirl, is but i have to check if those are checked
[12:10:04] <megalomix> $('#frmPackages input[type=checkbox]').is(':checked') <---- is not good ?
[12:10:21] <roothewhirl> yes
[12:10:24] <roothewhirl> that is much better
[12:10:30] <NoiseEee> megalomix: no, you want a collection of returned elements that are checked checkboxes, right?
[12:10:39] <megalomix> NoiseEee, exactly
[12:10:43] <roothewhirl> if you want to see if they're checked
[12:10:46] <NoiseEee> megalomix: $('#frmPackages input:checked')
[12:10:46] <roothewhirl> that is perfect
[12:10:53] <megalomix> i would like a list of the checkboxes checked
[12:10:57] <megalomix> because i need to get their values
[12:11:19] <NoiseEee> megalomix: is() is to be used on a single element; $('#frmPackages input[type=checkbox]') would give you a collection
[12:11:42] <megalomix> NoiseEee, but how can i retrive the value of each ?
[12:11:42] <NoiseEee> megalomix: so use the selector to get even finer control over whats returned
[12:11:48] <roothewhirl> megalomix you have already set them as automatically checked in the HTML?
[12:11:49] <megalomix> do i have to create a for() loop ?
[12:11:54] <megalomix> no
[12:11:57] <megalomix> the user should set it
[12:12:07] <megalomix> those are unchecked at the beginning
[12:12:29] <mantas322> hmmm
[12:12:31] <mantas322> this sucks
[12:12:39] <megalomix> list = $('#frmPackages input:checked')
[12:12:39] <megalomix> ?
[12:12:47] <mantas322> my coldfusion operations take infinatly longer when the jquery.js library is included
[12:13:05] <megalomix> NoiseEee, var list = $('#frmPackages input:checked')
[12:13:07] <megalomix> right?
[12:13:51] <NoiseEee> megalomix: sure, and then you can  $.each(list,function(i,el) { el = $(el); alert(el.val()); }
[12:14:07] <NoiseEee> megalomix: sure, and then you can  $.each(list,function(i,el) { el = $(el); alert(el.val()); }) that is
[12:14:54] <megalomix> NoiseEee, perfect! thank you so much!
[12:14:58] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[12:15:45] <mattp_> ive read about form submit buttons being hard to style .. what is the downside of just arbitrarily triggering $('#form').submit() from a click event elsewhere (ie a div or image)?
[12:15:54] <aclockworkpeter> how do I figure out event.keycode for when I click a certain widget
[12:16:08] <NoiseEee> mattp_: just accessibility really
[12:16:21] <NoiseEee> mattp_: and 'semantics' fwiw
[12:16:49] <khmer> mattp_: they're not so hard to style that you should avoid using them
[12:17:13] <mattp_> i see
[12:17:19] <mattp_> thanks guys
[12:18:38] <MagePsycho> guys can you refer some unlimited scrolling like twitter for pagination?
[12:18:47] <TehRabbitt> not sure why this is happening but i can't get it to work: jQuery is not defined		   var $j = jQuery().noConflict();
[12:18:56] <mantas322> yes magepsycho
[12:18:59] <mantas322> I preferr that
[12:19:22] <MagePsycho> which jquery plugin mantas322 ?
[12:19:39] <mantas322> i donno
[12:19:43] <mantas322> i just got here last week
[12:19:52] <mantas322> all i know is illegal token exception
[12:19:55] <hobbelt> I have a php script fetching an array of values from my DB. (dots on a map). Using Jquery I want to display a hidden DIV containing additional information about the dot. How can I do this? Tried the "on hover show" Jquery functions but ofcourse I have multiple with different IDs on one page
[12:20:11] <ohcibi> is anybody using javascriptmvc and knows how to avoid it loading jquery?
[12:21:22] <gho5t> I need to select all spans with an attribute of "data-points" and combine those values into an array and create a json object of that
[12:22:09] <MagePsycho> any idea on unlimited scrolling jquery plugin?
[12:22:13] <TehRabbitt> anyone able to help? :-\
[12:24:11] <NoiseEee> MagePsycho: google "javascript lazy loading jquery"
[12:24:53] <MagePsycho> thanks NoiseEee
[12:27:51] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[12:28:33] <gho5t> I need to select all spans with an attribute of "data-points" and combine those values into an array and create a json object of that
[12:28:50] <NoiseEee> go for it gho5t!!
[12:29:12] <MagePsycho> is that related to infinte scroll pagination NoiseEee ?
[12:29:35] <andrew9183> what does "this.jq" mean ?
[12:29:42] <NoiseEee> MagePsycho: thats essentially what it is.   you load X things at once, scroll through them, you get somewhere near the end, more info loads into the page/div etc
[12:31:02] <mantas322> now I have a page that gives me no errors
[12:31:06] <mantas322> but wont stop loading
[12:31:13] <mantas322> 'what arey ou loading'!
[12:31:31] <red_square> prob iframes
[12:32:08] <mantas322> no its this document.write
[12:32:13] <mantas322> that i shouldnt be doing
[12:32:22] <mantas322> im pretty sure
[12:33:33] <gho5t> NoiseEee: with your blessing, I am  now starting this adventure!
[12:34:51] <hobbelt> function toggleDiv(divId) {  <-- Parse error: unexpected ')'. ??? it should be alright shouldnt it?
[12:34:57] <gho5t> data: JSON.stringify({ lines: $that.find("[data-points]").data("points").each(function(){ ??? })
[12:35:07] <gho5t> what do i replace the ??? with to build up an array here
[12:35:20] <gho5t> data: JSON.stringify({ lines: $that.find("[data-points]").data("points").each(function(){ ??? })
[12:35:26] <TehRabbitt> can anyone try to help me figure out why jQuery isn't working through RichFaces?
[12:35:31] <red_square> ? paste @ gho5t
[12:35:31] <bot-t> gho5t, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:35:34] <TehRabbitt>                 jQuery().get('AITLabel.xml', function(labelXml)  tells me that jQuery() is undefined
[12:35:35] <matthew_> Say I have a page with multiple people on it at the same time - and I wanted to show each user the location of the other users' cursors by visually drawing one on the screen. How would I do this? I imagine I would need to store this infor on the server and have each euser periodically poll the server for everyone's new locations. How could I store that cursor information easily so I could retrieve it quickly
[12:35:38] <TehRabbitt> yet $ is defined
[12:35:45] <TehRabbitt> but I can't use $ otherwise it says that $ is undefined

[12:36:06] <red_square> matthew_ you need a comet style app or websockets

[12:38:09] <asdf12> hi after using serializeArray() is there a simple way to convert that array into a object?
[12:38:22] <asdf12> well, like a json object
[12:38:38] <gho5t> asdf12: sounds like we are having the reverse issue maybe
[12:38:49] <gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/N6jbb/

[12:39:39] <ohcibi> is anyone using javascriptmvc and knows how to stop it from stealing jquery as i have jquery already included?
[12:39:49] <mantas322> and jquery is MESSING it uP!
[12:39:59] <red_square> stealing, call the cops
[12:40:18] <red_square> ohcibi does it use a lib like require or something
[12:40:50] <ohcibi> red_square: dont know actually
[12:42:30] <red_square> ohcibi just dont include jq then
[12:42:39] <red_square> if it does it
[12:43:01] <hobbelt> (4 rules, syntaxt error?, how should i fix it?  http://pastebin.com/qgh4FDjC
[12:43:12] <ohcibi> red_square: of course thats the dev-mode-solution, but in production mode, its possible that i want it to be load from a cdn
[12:43:57] <matthew_> red_square: that seems pretty complex!
[12:44:04] <matthew_> red_square: but also pretty neat
[12:44:10] <red_square> ohcibi http://forum.javascriptmvc.com/topic/jquery-from-google-cdn
[12:44:50] <red_square> matthew_ it is neat, what server stack are you on
[12:45:01] <matthew_> red_square: LAMP
[12:45:10] <matthew_> red_square: P being python
[12:45:22] <red_square> peice of cake then
[12:45:32] <ohcibi> red_square: ok.. i found a forum post which is 9 months old and one that is 3 month old, both telling the same 8)) thought anyone would know something new...
[12:46:10] <red_square> ohcibi dont like the sound of them needing to hack at jquery
[12:46:16] <matthew_> red_square: are web sockets pretty new and not very widely supported yet?
[12:46:18] <red_square> ohcibi try backbone:)
[12:46:31] <red_square> matthew_ only v.modern browsers
[12:46:53] <gho5t> red_square: http://jsfiddle.net/N6jbb/
[12:47:09] <matthew_> red_square: I am thinking that web sockets would be the most straight forward way to do this stuff
[12:47:31] <red_square> matthew_ have you control over clients?
[12:47:39] <matthew_> red_square: what do you mean
[12:47:41] <ohcibi> red_square: i dont know about the tweaking, the jquery version that comes today is plain 1.7.1
[12:48:02] <b1lly1> is there away to append
[12:48:06] <b1lly1> an element and all its children
[12:48:11] <b1lly1> i have a loop going thru a list
[12:48:48] <red_square> ohcibi dunno, ping justin on twitter
[12:50:08] <matthew_> red_square: do you mean knowing ahead of time how many connections I am going to have to deal with?
[12:50:55] <red_square> matthew_ no if you can tell your users to use chrome latest etc
[12:51:28] <matthew_> red_square: oh, yes in that case I can reasonably assume that any users of my app will be using modern stuff and not for instance IE 6 or 7
[12:52:03] <red_square> well you can use modernizr and if they dont support sockets you can tell them to upgrade

[13:05:46] <jarrod23> ah yes indeed that was it thx
[13:06:07] <jarrod23> does jquery also supply some way of adding content inside a div or could i better place all html content and hide certain elements?
[13:06:16] <jarrod23> what would be a better approach
[13:06:57] <b1lly1> jarrod23: $('selector').html('<div>whatup'</div>'); will change the contents inside the selected elemtn
[13:07:01] <kyb> hi
[13:07:11] <kyb> is there a jquery paginator that works by length?
[13:07:18] <someprimetime> how can i split an object into an array?
[13:07:18] <b1lly1> jarrod23: .append() will add content to the selector element
[13:07:25] <someprimetime> i'm thinking something like push() but it's not working
[13:07:35] <someprimetime> the object contains 2 dom elements
[13:08:52] <jarrod23> hmm i think i have to to include all content upfront
[13:09:05] <jarrod23> this is getting complicated ;p i basically have a div expanded or collapsed state
[13:09:39] <jarrod23> the collapsed state has some text boxes in there and some code generated content i guess i just hide those elements then
[13:09:46] <DofLeFou> red_square: all that i.e. is saying is it displays a message box titled "Message from webpage" and the error msg says "error Internal Server error"
[13:10:05] <DofLeFou> it works fine in FF n Safari
[13:12:38] <Pupeno_W> How can I make jquery understand json with the keys quoted when it's sent back from an ajax call?
[13:13:09] <chrisinajar> Pupeno_W: dataType: 'json'
[13:14:42] <DofLeFou> Anyone can spot what i am doing wrong here https://gist.github.com/1618127
[13:14:57] <DofLeFou> all that i.e. is saying is it displays a message box titled "Message from webpage" and the error msg says "error Internal Server error"
[13:15:04] <DofLeFou> it works fine in FF n Safari
[13:15:47] <Pupeno_W> chrisinajar: thanks.
[13:16:48] <red_square> DofLeFou so does it do the request?
[13:17:07] <red_square> use fiddler - see whats going on, whats the response
[13:17:30] <DofLeFou> fiddler can work with IE?
[13:17:42] <red_square> yeah its just a http sniffer
[13:18:11] <red_square> or use the developer tools in ie8/9
[13:18:13] <jarrod23> thx for the help here i got it partly working, http://jsfiddle.net/NsBWy/9/
[13:18:22] <timwis> Hey guys, is there any reason why $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg();  wouldn't be working ? I'm not hiding it...it just doesn't show up
[13:18:30] <jarrod23> 2 boxes you can collapse and expand, im trying to make them work on multiple boxes what would be a good approach for that?
[13:18:32] <timwis> I put a console.log just before it and that works
[13:18:58] <jarrod23> and some way to hid the yellow text when you first enter the page except when a box is collapsed, getting quite complex then ;s
[13:20:09] <DofLeFou> red_square: i m getting the developer tools
[13:20:18] <red_square> it comes with it
[13:20:19] <red_square> f12
[13:23:48] <theBrettman> how can I get the length of all of an elements ancestors?
[13:24:26] <20QAAK27C> hey guys, is it possible to convert xml to json with jquery?
[13:24:38] <red_square> $('div').parents().length theBrettman
[13:24:48] <theBrettman> thx red
[13:25:13] <theBrettman> is there a way to stop it before a certain parent element like body?
[13:25:48] <jarrod23> any real guru could help me out with this revision: http://jsfiddle.net/NsBWy/10/
[13:25:50] <red_square> ? parentsUntil @ theBrettman

[13:26:03] <jarrod23> i seem to fbe unable to find a good example for multiple toggle divs
[13:26:21] <DofLeFou> red_square: I got it .. i found out if i switch the mode to IE8 it start working in IE
[13:26:35] <red_square> jarrod23 use .on
[13:26:45] <red_square> ? .on @ jarrod23
[13:26:46] <bot-t> jarrod23, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:26:52] <windsurf_> i have a $.ajax call that now i need to change to just a regular form post to a 3rd party url (not async). How should I do this?
[13:27:05] <theBrettman> sweet. thx guys
[13:27:11] <red_square> DofLeFou ok so ie7 might be broke still
[13:27:21] <jarrod23> red_square: .on? ok thx but im having jquery 1.5 cannot use 1.7 yet
[13:27:24] <red_square> windsurf_ u cant using xmlhttp
[13:27:33] <red_square> server side windsurf_
[13:27:46] <red_square> ? delegate @ jarrod23
[13:27:46] <bot-t> jarrod23, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:28:17] <windsurf_> red_square: OK. i have an array of values, so how do i send those to a 3rd party url? just regular form post stuff?
[13:28:22] <red_square> oh windsurf_ I read your q again
[13:28:33] <red_square> u can regular post x-domain
[13:28:41] <DofLeFou> red_square: thank you for the and
[13:28:46] <windsurf_> i guess i could dynamically create a new form then call its submit action or something?
[13:28:52] <red_square> DofLeFou np
[13:29:01] <red_square> yeah or hidden iframe windsurf_
[13:29:03] <windsurf_> or not even create a new form
[13:29:08] <DofLeFou> ama force the browser to run in mode IE8
[13:30:27] <tomster2300> i'm pulling a rss feed in through jquery's .get method - is there any way to convert the xml that I get into json?  The xml is such a pain to go through
[13:31:03] <systemfault> Not really as XML can do much more than JSON
[13:31:03] <red_square> serverside tomster2300
[13:31:17] <red_square> systemfault like what?
[13:31:49] <systemfault> Arg.. nothing.
[13:32:04] <tomster2300> thanks systemfault and red_square - i'm trying to keep all of it clientside if possible as i'm making a chrome extension
[13:32:16] <tomster2300> i guess ill just have to read the xml
[13:32:17] <tomster2300> sigh
[13:32:23] <systemfault> tomster2300: Then you'll have no other choice than playing with Xpaths :/
[13:34:34] <tomster2300> are there any 3rd party server side systems i could run it through ? probably a stretch, i know
[13:35:19] <red_square> tomster2300 yahoo pipes?
[13:35:51] <red_square> http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/yahoo-pipes-xml-json
[13:37:34] <tomster2300> that might just work - thanks guys!
[13:42:10] <yan_nick> hey guys, i've an array and want to put it as an attribute to an element like <span data-images="[{...}, {...}]"> how can i do that? it's not possible to do $('span').attr('data-images', array);
[13:42:31] <systemfault> yan_nick: attrs are string..
[13:42:36] <systemfault> JSON.stringify them
[13:42:50] <systemfault> "them" being those arrays
[13:43:19] <nicholasschulz> I have a problem passing variables with spaces via AJAX.. is this a common thing?
[13:43:41] <alexr2> no nicholasschulz
[13:43:46] <alexr2> just pass it as an array
[13:43:58] <spiffytech> I have a div that gets shown when I hover on it, and a button that also toggles whether or not the div is shown. Problem is, when I hover over the div, I have to click the button twice to close it- once to trigger the "show" toggle, then again to trigger the "hide" toggle. How can I set the hover function to activate the "show" toggle, so the user only has to click the button once to close the div?
[13:44:11] <alexr2> much easier that way
[13:45:04] <nicholasschulz> alexr2: i pass it like this… http://jsfiddle.net/ExCAb/ please show how I can pass as array??
[13:45:09] <yan_nick> systemfault++
[13:46:33] <chrisinajar> nicholasschulz: what are you trying to do?
[13:46:39] <chrisinajar> 'pass as array'? what?
[13:47:18] <nicholasschulz> "I have a problem passing variables with spaces via AJAX.. is this a common thing?"
[13:47:40] <nicholasschulz> when i pass a value that contain a space, it doesn't do much..
[13:47:47] <nicholasschulz> without spaces it works fine
[13:48:47] <chrisinajar> again, what are you talking about? can you show me?
[13:48:59] <chrisinajar> ajax supports spaces perfectly fine.
[13:49:28] <chrisinajar> if you can get a jsfiddle working that shows what you're talking about then i can happily take a look at it and help you out :)
[13:50:40] <alexr2> nicholasschulz http://jsfiddle.net/ExCAb/2/
[13:51:16] <nicholasschulz> the jsfiddle would take some time with this thing.. I can show you my website though.. Choose some different options from the drop down -> some return "Loaded course: x" (then the value passed doesn't contain spaces), others doesn't return anything. http://bannaky.com/ (Go to sell)
[13:52:20] <chrisinajar> aahhh
[13:52:23] <nicholasschulz> Oh, excuse a huge misspell from my part : not using AJAX, using load();
[13:52:27] <chrisinajar> that's not english!
[13:52:45] <chrisinajar> although, that's a nice looking site :)
[13:52:59] <nicholasschulz> haha chrisnajar -> go to "Selg" and then use the drop down :-p thanks
[13:53:34] <chrisinajar> hahaha, one option is in english
[13:53:44] <imsky> awooo ga
[13:54:06] <nicholasschulz> Yeah Im currently translating it into norwegian… I probably should keep it in english while i develop it
[13:54:08] <nicholasschulz> :-p
[13:54:28] <chrisinajar> or localize it so that you can swap back and forth by just including a different file...
[13:55:29] <nicholasschulz> hm, example? i have most of the text written in my html page
[13:56:00] <chrisinajar> nicholasschulz: anyway.... use ajax, all problems will be solved
[13:56:09] <chrisinajar> ?ajax
[13:56:09] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:56:40] <wabism> hm
[13:57:12] <nicholasschulz> chrisinajar: Ok :-)
[14:22:14] <velts> anyone know if jquery UI allows for custom dropdowns and checkboxs?
[14:26:33] <[E]sc> anyway to go back to previous page that was triggered using #anchor tag using jquery?
[14:34:56] <velts> [E]sc: window.history.back() ?
[14:36:04] <[E]sc> velts, doesn't seem to work...i also tried $("#backPacker").trigger("click");
[14:36:23] <[E]sc> it'll go back to the previous page, but won't focus on the anchor.
[14:48:34] <cjordan> I've got a problem that I've illustrated and outlined here: http://jsfiddle.net/eaYPf/2/ ...
[14:48:41] <cjordan> can anyone give me a hand with that?
[14:50:32] <cjordan> I should probably mention with that example that you'll have to have your firebug console open to see any results...
[14:51:49] <TehRabbitt> okay I was here earlier trying to figure out how to get my jQuery script working with RichFaces, but I've had no luck still :-\
[14:51:55] <cjordan> @[E]sc: you could use window.history.go(-1)...
[14:52:04] <TehRabbitt> I have my working jQuery script up on pastebin, but I"m not sure how to get it working using richfaces
[14:52:07] <cjordan> but that's not jquery, and also kinda clunky...
[14:52:34] <TehRabbitt> http://pastebin.com/Hgq4QsaF
[14:52:52] <TehRabbitt> if anyone can help me figure this out it'd be amazing, esp since my eyes are bugging out of my skull at this point :-\
[14:52:58] <cjordan> Sorry, TehRabbit... pastebin is blocked from my office :o(
[14:53:27] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: Figure what out?
[14:53:34] <TehRabbitt> http://paste.debian.net/152518/
[14:53:35] <TehRabbitt> that
[14:53:40] <TehRabbitt> cjordan: that link work?
[14:53:48] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: I have everything working jQuery wise
[14:53:55] <TehRabbitt> and everythign works, it all prints etc..
[14:54:19] <TehRabbitt> basically, I include it into the JSF file, using   <script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/PrintLabel.js"></script>
[14:54:24] <TehRabbitt> and it loads
[14:54:36] <TehRabbitt> but it breaks the existing javascript "popup" calender on one of the pages
[14:54:45] <cjordan> Sorry... it doesn't... I'm not a RichFaces expert anyway... just thought it might be something that a second set of eyes could spot.
[14:54:48] <TehRabbitt> which I didn't make (it uses RichFaces)
[14:55:05] <TehRabbitt> cjordan: it might be somethign silly i'm leaving out
[14:55:18] <TehRabbitt> so far my googling has found me these: https://community.jboss.org/message/644052
[14:55:29] <TehRabbitt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1956719/jquery-get-is-not-a-function

[14:55:44] <intellilogic> HTML:  <div id='somediv'><a href='index.php?loc=home'>blabla</a>   I want to get the loc paramiter value from that link, how can I do that?  I was hoping for something like:  var foo = $("#somediv a").attr('href').data("loc");  (Guessing)
[14:55:48] <TehRabbitt> but I have no idea how to implement any of those
[14:56:12] <cjordan> Can anyone help me with my simple issue?
[14:56:18] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ cjordan
[14:56:18] <bot-t> cjordan, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:56:35] <cjordan> See: http://jsfiddle.net/eaYPf/2/ for explaination and working example...
[14:57:03] <cjordan> bot-t... I did that earlier... no response... tha'ts why I put it that way...
[14:57:56] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: any ideas on what I might be doing wrong?
[14:58:27] <Eviltwin> Doesn't really sound like a jQuery problem
[14:58:29] <cjordan> My issue here is that I want access to the text of the selected option as well as the value of that option. While .val() does a great job at getting the value of the selected item (in this case the numbers 1, 2 3, or 4), I'm unsure how to get the text of JUST the selected item.  As you can see in my example, I've tried using .text(), but that returns ALL of the text for ALL of the options, and not just the selected one.
[14:58:46] <cjordan> see working example here: http://jsfiddle.net/eaYPf/2/
[14:58:50] <coldhead> cjordan: $(':selected').text();
[14:58:54] <coldhead> ?:selected
[14:58:54] <bot-t> :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[14:59:06] <cjordan> bah!
[14:59:22] <coldhead> not "bah!", rather "ooh!"
[14:59:23] <cjordan> Thanks folks... I knew I was missing something simple.
[15:00:53] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/eaYPf/3/
[15:01:02] <cjordan> Thanks ColdHead... adding a .find(':selected') is exactly what I wanted...
[15:01:07] <Eviltwin> Oh, that much simpler solution
[15:01:08] <TehRabbitt> all they tell me is: Refer to the jQuery documentation for the right syntax. Remember to use jQuery() function instead of $(), as soon as jQuery works without conflicts                   with prototype.js.
[15:01:13] <cjordan> I use that selector all the time... Can't believe I forgot it...
[15:01:47] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: (function($){...})(jQuery);
[15:01:47] <cjordan> can anyone tell me if bot-t is a person or a bot as the name implies...?
[15:01:49] <Eviltwin> Perhaps?
[15:01:52] <tgp1994> Hi everyone, I'm hoping someone might be able to drop by my website (http://comets.firstobjective.org) and help me with a menu rendering issue. When you hover over, for example, the Team menu, it appears ok, but when it goes to disappear, it drops down by about 30 pixels. Can anyone tell me why?
[15:01:52] <TehRabbitt> so if they want me to use jQuery() instead, how would I write this: 		var Serial = $("input[id*=snc]");
[15:01:55] <Eviltwin> cjordan: It's a bog, dude
[15:01:56] <Eviltwin> bot*
[15:02:11] <Eviltwin> You'll notice it doesn't speak without propmpting
[15:02:15] <cjordan> okay... just it's really not frendly in the tone it uses... just my experience with it.
[15:02:15] <Eviltwin> prompting*
[15:02:22] <sviatovigt> hi
[15:02:23] <TehRabbitt> var Serial = jQuery("input(id*=snc)");?
[15:02:41] <sviatovigt> how can I pass variables from php to javascript?
[15:02:59] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: If you use the wrapper I suggested, it makes $ be jQuery inside
[15:03:30] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: problem is, Prototype.js is already using $ so RichFaces forces you to use jQuery() instead of $()
[15:03:33] <TehRabbitt> thats the problem i'm having
[15:03:41] <TehRabbitt> idk what the syntax should be
[15:03:47] <TehRabbitt> since I wrote everythign using $() or $.
[15:04:07] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: And I'm telling you that (function($){...})(jQuery); says "Fuck you, Prototype, I'm making $ be jQuery"
[15:04:20] <roothewhirl> Naive question. Can jQuery do everything raw JavaScript can do? What are some good uses for only using pure JavaScript?
[15:04:27] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: and where would I put this? in my onload?
[15:04:32] <TehRabbitt> before any declerations?
[15:04:33] <Eviltwin> roothewhirl: JavaScript is JavaScript
[15:04:37] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: It's a wrapper
[15:04:41] <Eviltwin> Hence the ...
[15:04:45] <TehRabbitt> Ohhhh
[15:04:49] <TehRabbitt> so wrap my entire code with that?
[15:04:51] <roothewhirl> so, jQuery is just an "easier" way of writing JavaScript?
[15:04:58] <TehRabbitt> roothewhirl: it's like shorthand
[15:05:02] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: Any code where you want to force $ to be jQuery
[15:05:10] <Eviltwin> roothewhirl: jQuery is a framework
[15:05:12] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: thanks... i'm going to give it a try
[15:05:17] <Eviltwin> roothewhirl: It makes some things simpler
[15:05:43] <roothewhirl> not to get to philosophical, but has it "replaced" a lot of reasons to write raw JavaScript?
[15:05:55] <Eviltwin> It makes a lot of things easier
[15:06:09] <coldhead> it has replaced it in the same way c++ has replace c
[15:06:10] <Eviltwin> Like say you want to add a class to every <td> inside the element with ID "foo"
[15:06:13] <coldhead> replace*
[15:06:27] <Eviltwin> You can do $("#foo td").addClass("myclass")
[15:06:55] <roothewhirl> so, i have a general understanding of  raw JavaScript
[15:07:06] <roothewhirl> should i focus more of my effort learning jQuery?
[15:07:08] <roothewhirl> from here on out
[15:07:13] <Eviltwin> No
[15:07:25] <Eviltwin> You should learn JavaScript to at least an intermediate level first
[15:07:31] <roothewhirl> okay
[15:07:40] <roothewhirl> i was thinking of using jQuery as training wheels :D
[15:07:43] <imsky> nope
[15:07:44] <roothewhirl> then coming back to JavaScript
[15:07:46] <imsky> not a good idea
[15:07:46] <Eviltwin> Because when using jQuery, you will need to use a lot of intermediate and advanced JavaScript
[15:07:50] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ roothewhirl
[15:07:50] <bot-t> roothewhirl, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:08:38] <roothewhirl> okay. I have definitely taken a lot of JavaScript in as of late, but haven't spent a lot of time actually writing it, maybe I will spend the next few months really getting knee deep into JavaScript
[15:08:52] <intellilogic> I want to get the PHP get variable data from a link written into the HTML, how can I do this?   <a id='ezselector' href='foo.php?x=9&y=3'>
[15:08:56] <roothewhirl> before I dive head first into jQuery
[15:09:28] <Eviltwin> roothewhirl: While most disagree, I think you be able to tell me what this statement does in only a few seconds
[15:09:31] <Eviltwin> Before learning jQuery
[15:09:31] <Eviltwin> ?hard
[15:09:32] <bot-t> var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[15:10:12] <Eviltwin> Essentailly at a glance

[15:16:11] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: how can I tell if $ is jQuery? is there an easy check?
[15:16:13] <roothewhirl> Eviltwin I can tell that you are setting z as the string "foo" then setting a function called x with the parameter of "y" being passed through it. you are then returning a certain index of "this" with the string "foo". then you are declaring w as the object or function x with the method of apply and passing it the document objection and the index of getElementById....HAHA
[15:16:19] <roothewhirl> that's the best i can do on that one
[15:16:24] <roothewhirl> and that half baked answer
[15:16:30] <roothewhirl> took me waaay longer than a couple seconds :D
[15:16:32] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: console.log($ === jQuery);

[15:17:38] <Eviltwin> Are you loading this before jQuery?
[15:18:01] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: I'm not loading jQuery because RichFaces is supposed to be doing it :\
[15:18:12] <TehRabbitt> let me add <a4j:loadScript src="resource://jquery.js"/> to the HTML page and see if it fixes it
[15:18:27] <whoever> Eviltwin: i did read my code thats why I posted
[15:18:53] <roothewhirl> oh well. i wouldn't have even gotten that far a couple months ago. i will keep reading/studying/applying what i have learned until i get it right :)

[15:21:24] <ThemNuts> sup guys, how do i count the number of values and split them from something like val(ui.item.TelNr) ?
[15:23:17] <ThemNuts> Now i got this JSON and jQuery that autocompletes fields with data. The TelNr items can have 0 to ... items but for the moment they all get filled in the 1 input field. i want to be able to count how many TelNr contains, splt them and add input fields with value for each one.
[15:23:27] <ThemNuts> http://pastebin.com/e8T0Ypze
[15:23:48] <whoever> Eviltwin: yes, and i thaught first,second third and last wosld work from what i see on stack overflow
[15:24:54] <tomster2300> hey guys, is there a way to output an entire json document onto a page?
[15:24:58] <tomster2300> w/ jquery
[15:25:12] <tomster2300> nothing pretty - i just need to show it to someone
[15:25:20] <Eviltwin> Use JSON.stringify and put it in the document?
[15:26:34] <tomster2300> i used a jquery plugin to convert an xml document into json and add it to a variable - will JSON.stringify still work?
[15:26:57] <Eviltwin> If it's JSON, JSON.stringify will work
[15:27:20] <tomster2300> i'll try that then - thanks!
[15:28:10] <someprimetime> i wrote some ajax tab switchers awhile ago and now i'm realizing i didn't make the modular enough. problem is i'm targeting a specific div to load the content but it's not currently referencing $(this) container, it'll reference all of them
[15:28:27] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Code?
[15:28:28] <someprimetime> i'm thinking of just iterating through each object and initializing those tabs like that for when the page first loads
[15:28:36] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: h/o let me take it out of this namespace
[15:28:58] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Have you read this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:29:09] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah, but this was written before i read that
[15:29:16] <someprimetime> so i'm trying to convert it slowly over
[15:29:20] <someprimetime> (along with most of my old code)

[15:32:22] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Have you looked at the jQuery UI Widget factory?
[15:32:32] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: not sure what that is

[15:32:53] <Eviltwin> Flip through it
[15:33:26] <someprimetime> word thanks
[15:36:57] <intellilogic> var str = jQuery.param("fooo.php?loc=bla&x=3&y=4"); console.log(str['loc']);    Any way to make this work?
[15:37:19] <Eviltwin> What you're looking for is deparam

[15:45:09] <jarrod23> hi everyone im back at some jquery again fun
[15:45:23] <jarrod23> only 1 small issue http://jsfiddle.net/NsBWy/12/ im not getting the expanded_content div to show/hide upon click
[15:45:33] <jarrod23> anyone an idea how i could tackle that?
[15:46:33] <Serialize2Binary> (I know this is jQuery UI specific), but how can I provide a function associated with my jquery UI widget instance that can be called to get its values?
[15:46:47] <Eviltwin> Only one element can have a given ID
[15:47:28] <roothewhirl> ?learn
[15:47:29] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:47:47] <jarrod23> toggle works then why     $(e.target).closest("#expanded_content").show(); does not i dont get
[15:47:50] <Serialize2Binary> roothewhirl: I do know Javascript.
[15:48:07] <jarrod23> that should always be the one closest to the clicked link, instead it always gets the 1st div
[15:48:29] <roothewhirl> i definitely don't know JavaScript :D
[15:48:33] <roothewhirl> i can sorta, kinda read it
[15:49:02] <roothewhirl> i do love me some standards-based html and css
[15:49:14] <roothewhirl> just looking to learn more about JavaScript/jQuery :D
[15:49:28] <zoran119_> if i have $(".blah").on("click", function() {...}), will click be attached to all new .blah's that are added to the page?
[15:49:39] <Serialize2Binary> I love Madonna so much that it hurts.
[15:49:58] <roothewhirl> is codeacademy.com down for anyone else?
[15:50:08] <Eviltwin> ?down codeacademy.com
[15:50:10] <bot-t> Eviltwin, It's just you. - http://codeacademy.com is up.
[15:50:14] <euxneks> I was going to come on here and ask a question, but I found the answer in the documentation. Thank you to whoever develops jQuery and whoever does the documentation. I am constantly impressed at how powerful this is and how awesome the documentation is. Again, thank you.
[15:50:30] <someprimetime> why does everyone like that site?
[15:51:28] <Serialize2Binary> euxneks: You're welcome.
[15:51:42] <Eviltwin> Serialize2Binary: It's more interactive learning
[15:53:18] <lgedeon> Hi, I am trying to bind to a click event on a button using .on but another script on the page (minifed plug-in I should not edit) also is bound to the button and is blocking my code.
[15:54:26] <lgedeon> I tried mousedoen but that is not firing, anyone else have ideas?
[15:54:46] <Eviltwin> lgedeon: You might be SOL
[15:55:39] <ThemNuts> now i use $('#bedrijftelnr').val(ui.item.TelNr); to put a value in an input field, thing is the ui.item.TelNr can have several values seperated by a comma, how do i split them, insert an input with value while looping trough them?
[15:56:36] <Eviltwin> ThemNuts: Can you give an example ui.item.TelNr and what the outcome would be?
[15:56:56] <lgedeon> the click triggers resizes and a sprite change, but where do I find a list of valid events to use with .on?
[15:57:18] <Eviltwin> Any browser event or custom jQuery event
[15:57:39] <ThemNuts> This is the JSON it receives and the full function: http://pastebin.com/e8T0Ypze Works fine now only the TelNr inserted in the input is 0123456,0843322 and want one for each
[15:57:58] <intellilogic> What's the difference between a jQuery function and a jQuery plugin?  Just a serperate file?
[15:58:11] <lgedeon> so is resize an event? Is that spelled correctly?
[15:58:18] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:59:49] <intellilogic> @Eviltwin yes to me?  or yes to all 3 above that?  LOL
[16:00:04] <Eviltwin> Yes to lgedeon
[16:00:23] <Eviltwin> The term "jQuery plugin" is pretty abstract
[16:00:34] <Eviltwin> Pretty much anything that changes jQuery's behavior in some way
[16:01:34] <Eviltwin> Most jQuery plugins insert a function or two into jQuery.fn
[16:01:38] <lgedeon> hmm, so if the click resizes a div any idea why this http://pastebin.com/jbkZ7yv7 would not fire?
[16:02:09] <Eviltwin> lgedeon: 'Cause you're not understanding what the resize event means
[16:02:13] <Eviltwin> lgedeon: see ?.resize
[16:02:14] <bot-t> lgedeon, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[16:03:03] <lgedeon> ohhhh *blush*
[16:05:05] <Serialize2Binary> $('madonna').is(':sexy') <-- A custom Sizzle filter?
[16:08:00] <seanephram>  '
[16:09:05] <Eviltwin> $.expr[":"]["sexy"] = function() { ... };
[16:09:16] <ThemNuts> any ideas Eviltwin ?
[16:09:29] <ThemNuts> trying to use split and get one value to show but aint working very well
[16:11:09] <Eviltwin> ThemNuts: TelNr.join(",")
[16:12:40] <Serialize2Binary> How do I get jQuery's serialize() to stop ignoring elements that aren't input or select elements?
[16:13:01] <Eviltwin> Like what?
[16:17:23] <seanephram> anybody worked with bxSlider recently? I could use some help trying to get a zoom effect, assuming I can find where this guy put the mouse events..
[16:20:29] <Serialize2Binary> Is jQueryUI dying?
[16:21:46] <Eviltwin> Serialize2Binary: No...
[16:21:47] <ajpiano> no.
[16:21:55] <Serialize2Binary> Okay good! :)
[16:22:13] <Eviltwin> But jQuery is
[16:22:19] <Serialize2Binary> Why?
[16:22:29] <Eviltwin> No one uses it
[16:22:34] <Serialize2Binary> lol
[16:23:49] <Serialize2Binary> So, I am aiming to build a jQueryUI widget that will 1) Tell me when the form has changed via callback 2) Provide the values of all inputs as a JavaScript object
[16:24:04] <Serialize2Binary> Has this been done?
[16:24:15] <roothewhirl> does anyone here making a living just as a JavaScript/jQuery specialist?
[16:24:40] <Eviltwin> roothewhirl: If you call $100 a living
[16:24:45] <roothewhirl> ha
[16:25:22] <roothewhirl> so pretty sure "front end dev" is the way to go? (IE. HTML, CSS. JavaScript, etc)
[16:25:35] <roothewhirl> kind of what i am striving towards
[16:25:42] <roothewhirl> at least
[16:26:02] <red_square> Serialize2Binary things like knockoutjs bind models to forms and keep things in sync
[16:26:12] <Serialize2Binary> roothewhirl: You need to know human factors engineering and have a good design sense these days, not just know how to write CSS and JS code.
[16:26:18] <roothewhirl> cool
[16:26:29] <roothewhirl> i do have the whole "graphic design" background thing going for me, too
[16:26:42] <roothewhirl> just making that akward transition from designer to hybrid designer/developer
[16:26:47] <zkirill> When should I use $(document).on("click","#blah", function(event){ … }); instead of $("#blah").click( function(event) { … }); ?
[16:26:51] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman serializeobject plugin @ Serialize2Binary
[16:26:52] <bot-t> Serialize2Binary, Ben Alman  jQuery Misc plugins - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[16:26:55] <Serialize2Binary> Hmm, you reckon Knockout might be good red_square? :)
[16:26:57] <roothewhirl> it seems painful sometimes
[16:27:08] <Serialize2Binary> Seems kind of like Backbone
[16:27:10] <roothewhirl> because i don't want to go the whole "jack of all trades master of none" route
[16:27:20] <roothewhirl> there is just soo much to know these days as a front-end dev, though
[16:27:23] <red_square> Serialize2Binary not sure, use backbone myself
[16:27:32] <Eviltwin> zkirill: When #blah may not exist at the time of binding
[16:27:38] <Eviltwin> It uses event delegation
[16:27:52] <zkirill> Eviltwin: is there a performance hit? Why not just use (document) all the time?
[16:28:03] <zkirill> (thanks by the way)
[16:28:07] <Eviltwin> Becuase it can be a performance hit, yes
[16:28:17] <zkirill> Ah
[16:28:19] <Eviltwin> Do you know what the first syntax does?
[16:28:20] <roothewhirl> so..UX design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
[16:28:26] <roothewhirl> all good things to know in today's market
[16:28:40] <Eviltwin> Like what the result is
[16:29:03] <red_square> sup ajpiano
[16:29:12] <ajpiano> red_square: heyoooooooooo
[16:29:19] <red_square> :) when is the ui grid rdy
[16:29:22] <zkirill> Eviltwin: It watches all of document for changes to #blah?
[16:29:31] <ajpiano> red_square: WHEN IT'S DONE
[16:29:38] <Eviltwin> zkirill: Not exactly
[16:29:40] <red_square> haha....
[16:29:47] <Eviltwin> it binds a click listener to the document
[16:30:01] <Eviltwin> Essentially every click
[16:30:08] <Eviltwin> It does a check
[16:30:17] <Eviltwin> To see if the matched element matched the selector
[16:30:20] <Eviltwin> And if so, it calls your function
[16:30:54] <zkirill> Hmm, that seems wasteful. I guess I should really use it only when I need to.
[16:31:17] <Eviltwin> Definitely can be, yes
[16:32:09] <red_square> zkirill used mainly for list of things, to only listen at the container, rather than binding x separate events for each child
[16:32:47] <zkirill> red_square: I have dynamically generated HTML that's created from templates...
[16:33:16] <Eviltwin> I recall some statistic about the average delegate performance being better than the standard bind performance if it's binding to three or more elements
[16:34:23] <nicholasschulz> I have this $("#someDiv").load('url'); that loads each time a user select an option from a drop down… I want to display a loading image (here: load.gif) while it loads to show that something is happening.. How do I do this?
[16:35:20] <red_square> nicholasschulz use .ajax and use the beforeSend and complete events to show/hide the spinner
[16:35:33] <techouse> so i got an element and i want jquery to display some arrows when i hover say the upper 50% of its height
[16:35:39] <techouse> is that possible?
[16:35:51] <techouse> without any extra html markup i mean
[16:35:55] <nicholasschulz> red_square : do you have an example?
[16:37:02] <Phoenixz> I have a div with a large text content.. How can I make the scroll bar go all the way down?
[16:37:26] <Eviltwin> techouse: You can probably adapt this: http://jsfiddle.net/egZHj/
[16:37:30] <red_square> nicholasschulz not on me no, give it a go
[16:37:46] <nicholasschulz> red_square Ok, thanks :-)
[16:37:56] <ajpiano> red_square: how you been mate
[16:40:08] <dddbmt_> What is the most apropiate way to get the <body> tag?
[16:41:36] <Phoenixz> dddbmt_: $('body') ?
[16:41:53] <Phoenixz> How can I move a scrollbar of a div all the way to the bottom with jQuery?
[16:41:56] <dddbmt_> Phoenixz, that was simple.
[16:42:04] <dddbmt_> thx
[16:42:20] <red_square> ajpiano busy, away from web stuff but back now:)
[16:42:46] <ajpiano> hoooray :)
[16:43:08] <asdf12> silly question, but what jquery function do i use to <label>replace this text only</label> ? and not completely replace the selector/element too like .replace does?
[16:43:20] <red_square> ya, backbone etc - having issues with grids
[16:43:36] <red_square> hence I await the shiny ui one
[16:44:47] <asdf12> and whats a more compact way to bind several selectors to an event instead of doing $('#blah').keyup... $('#blah2').keyup ?
[16:45:19] <red_square> asdf12 use a class and use .on
[16:45:31] <red_square> if they all have the same handler
[16:47:30] <asdf12> ok thanks
[16:47:54] <asdf12> what about my question about similar function to .replace but that doesn't replace the element ? no function?
[16:48:11] <tw2113> append()? appendto() ?
[16:48:35] <jstout24> i'm trying to resize an iframe to 100% of the document window... what's the proper way of doing this?
[16:49:01] <jstout24> $(document).height() and width() work, but never shrinks in size for some reason...
[16:49:04] <asdf12> tw2113: no, i just want to replace the inner text on an element like <label>text</label> unless attr works for that?
[16:49:10] <brianfreud> Anyone know of something like hoverIntent, but to test if someone is scrolling in a select vs actually selecting something in a select?
[16:49:49] <seanephram> canybody worked with bxSlider recently? I could use some help trying to get a zoom effect, assuming I can find where this guy put the mouse events..
[16:49:56] <seanephram> Anybody** haha
[16:58:00] <theBrettman> how can I return the name of an element?
[16:58:32] <seanephram> anybody worked with bxSlider recently? I could use some help trying to get a zoom effect, assuming I can find where this guy put the mouse events..
[16:58:40] <red_square> $('#el')[0].nodeName theBrettman
[16:58:56] <theBrettman> thx again, red!
[17:00:25] <red_square> np
[17:00:43] <red_square> seanephram sorry not me
[17:01:34] <seanephram> redsquare, might you know the command to zoom an object in a slider? I want to assume its something like $(onClick(){ imageScale = 120%;}
[17:01:45] <seanephram> but I'm not that well versed in jq
[17:01:52] <dddbmt_> I am trying to write a simple jquery plugin. But if I have a code like this: http://pastie.org/3198578 - How do I call my function then? $.something(); does not work.
[17:02:18] <seanephram> thanks for the response, though (last question) redsquare
[17:02:38] <dddbmt_> It gives: Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)} has no method 'something'
[17:04:39] <dddbmt_> nvm, $('body').someting() worked.
[17:04:56] <erichynds> dddbmt_: also, it's return this.each(function() { });
[17:05:31] <dddbmt_> thanks erichynds - But else the template looks ok?
[17:05:48] <erichynds> ye
[17:06:58] <dddbmt_> Can I acces 'body' inside my plugin, let's say I want to append to its DOM?
[17:07:03] <dddbmt_> access
[17:07:15] <red_square> yes dddbmt_
[17:07:16] <coldhead> leaving cappital city
[17:08:38] <coldhead> this is where it stops
[17:13:17] <roothewhirl> okay everyone. time to leave work, get out from behind this lame firewall and start diving into codeacademy.com (overrated or not)
[17:13:54] <roothewhirl> see you (ladies and gents) later
[17:15:43] <konsument> somebody in here experienced with the beautyTips tooltip script?
[17:23:25] <rasmusth> is it possible with jquery to append an element to a specific class of elements "live", so that as new elements are loaded, if they have the spefic type, they will get the element appended?
[17:24:32] <red_square> rasmusth there is no dom changed event to hook into for that no
[17:24:51] <rasmusth> so it isnt possible?
[17:25:23] <red_square> you could use the livequery - but it scans the dom periodically
[17:25:35] <red_square> ? livequery @ rasmusth
[17:25:36] <bot-t> rasmusth, livequery is the devil. stay away from its evil temptation
[17:25:46] <rasmusth> rofl
[17:25:50] <red_square> haha
[17:26:39] <pringlescan> Does anyone know a regexp that will match the text in between two pipes |text1| non piped text |text2| … the obvious regexp matches  the whole string and takes the first and last | off instead of matching text1 and text2?
[17:26:47] <obrienmd> I have an issue w .ajaxSubmit giving us an [object Object] in PHP $_POST data, anyone run into this before?
[17:28:26] <seanephram> does anyone know if $(onClick(){ imageScale = 120%;} would be the proper command to zoom a jQuery slider?
[17:29:05] <erichynds> that'll give you a couple syntax errors
[17:29:06] <red_square> no
[17:29:25] <seanephram> oh, boo
[17:29:43] <red_square> I mean no as in what erichynds said, it is not the right way!
[17:30:03] <seanephram> what would be the proper one?
[17:30:12] <seanephram> also, thank you
[17:30:21] <red_square> depends on the plugin I guess
[17:30:55] <seanephram> ah, hm
[17:31:07] <seanephram> yeah, I was suspecting I could be telling it something that it isn't even programmed to do
[17:32:16] <seanephram> would anybody be wiling to look at the slider.js file?
[17:34:44] <otiuk> is there a way if you are reloading an image with jquery to imagefile.jpg?<timestamp here> and then using shadowbox it loads a cached version.. anyway to force that shadowbox to not cache it
[17:36:52] <theBrettman> anyone can see what I'm doing wrong? got errors in jslint but don't know why: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/3LmeY/
[17:37:51] <red_square> otiuk this may help http://shadowbox.1309102.n2.nabble.com/Resetting-Shadowbox-s-internal-cache-td1309559.html
[17:38:05] <otiuk> haha i am reading that as we speak
[17:38:57] <otiuk> so you can just called Shadowbox.setup(); ?
[17:39:14] <red_square> otiuk dont use it, give it a try:)
[17:40:44] <theBrettman> I like fancybox the best out of all of them
[17:40:55] <theBrettman> hey red, did you see my question?
[17:41:36] <otiuk> yep in that rotate function where the shadowbox was caching just adding Shadowbox.setup() into successful return and boom!  it works
[17:41:38] <otiuk> good stuff
[17:42:18] <red_square> theBrettman its late to be parsing that sort of code
[17:42:29] <red_square> "+l.nodeName ((l.id)?+'&nbsp;#'+l.id+:+)((l.hasClass)?+"
[17:42:50] <theBrettman> well, there's lint errors. it has something to do with my ternary operators I think
[17:42:52] <theBrettman> idk y
[17:42:56] <whoever> i am tring to replace text in a td with a button , but the button appears outside my td can someone assist http://jsfiddle.net/DE6dB/3/

[17:43:36] <theBrettman> k
[17:51:40] <catcher> Anyone used jquery ui autocomplete plug? I can't get the loading graphic to show, have tried many things :)
[17:52:21] <red_square> catcher is it 404'ing
[17:53:02] <catcher> red_square, I should check that specifically - tried to css it to be a simple colored square there, and no show on that either
[17:53:32] <catcher> red_square, hard to firebug for the 404 though since the class gets removed quickly
[17:53:47] <catcher> I guess I could infinite loop my json call..
[17:54:11] <red_square> but you should see the request for the image
[17:54:37] <red_square> if its in css then when the page loads
[17:56:35] <catcher> red_square, ah, indeed, it's getting the image okay.
[17:57:35] <catcher> no luck with z-index..
[17:57:59] <red_square> so use fb to add the class to the element so you can work out whats going on
[17:58:10] <red_square> mess with position etc
[18:03:28] <seanephram> :/
[18:03:35] <seanephram> oops, wrong box
[18:03:37] <seanephram> sorry guys
[18:06:04] <catcher> red_square, first I've done that with fb, very helpful (needed to make my css selector more specific)
[18:06:08] <catcher> thanks!
[18:08:50] <Whirl3d> Evenin' all. I asked this question earlier, but left before anyone responded. Does anyone have a link to an associative array of keycodes or charcode constants? Something like: var ALPHA={}; ALPHA.A=65; ALPHA.B=66;   or something similar?
[18:12:11] <Whirl3d> or then again, maybe I didn't. LOL No problem, I'll work it out myself and post a link in case anybody else needs it. Thanks anyways. Gnite all.
[18:19:43] <techouse> is there any way for append to add something at the beginngin of the node and not at the end?
[18:20:19] <coldhead> through the blackened air and all
[18:20:28] <coldhead> ?prepend @ techouse
[18:20:28] <bot-t> techouse, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[18:20:29] <techouse> or do i have to store the existing stuff in a var, append the thing and then restore the stuff
[18:20:32] <techouse> aaaaah
[18:20:33] <techouse> lol
[18:20:44] <techouse> soooo damn obvious i missed it
[18:20:50] <techouse> thanx! <3

[19:46:43] <coldhead> HOW ABOUT THE ANTI-VACCINATION LOBBY
[19:46:44] <coldhead> HAHAHAHA
[19:46:45] <hobs> I actually had 3 of my friends get girls preggers that they didnt plan on, so now I just hand out condoms whenever I am out with my buddies so I stop losing friends to baby syndrome
[19:46:50] <hobs> that is pretty funny
[19:46:56] <hobs> hey lets all get diseased and die please
[19:47:06] <Crimlo> good idea hob
[19:47:12] <Crimlo> but condoms are for losers
[19:47:31] <Crimlo> its best to just take a break instead
[19:47:31] <hobs> losers with unrotten dicks attached to them
[19:47:40] <Crimlo> not true
[19:47:51] <coldhead> please, i was trying to turn this into a wholesome discussion about idiocy
[19:47:55] <hobs> alright
[19:48:01] <coldhead> i'm just going to go to lunch is what i'm going to do
[19:48:05] <Crimlo> condoms are the worst invention ever
[19:48:06] <Pritchard> Anyone know how to change the opacity for jQuery.validationEngine popups?
[19:48:07] <hobs> how about the people who think downs is caused by vaccinations
[19:48:08] <coldhead> good luck with everything
[19:48:09] <hobs> thats pretty great
[19:48:15] <Crimlo> they take the wet out of sex
[19:48:24] <hobs> I told you it would be 10 minutes
[19:48:26] <Crimlo> which make it no good
[19:48:27] <hobs> I fucking told you
[19:48:32] <Pritchard> :(
[19:48:43] * Pritchard is traumatized
[19:48:50] <Pritchard> I just... wanted an answer to my question...
[19:48:54] <hobs> yep
[19:49:05] <Crimlo> yep
[19:49:19] <Crimlo> just change it damnit!
[19:49:27] <Crimlo> duh
[19:49:52] <Pritchard> Crimlo:  I wish it was that simple, but the opacity attribute isn't in the CSS file.
[19:50:14] <Pritchard> Looking in the js file now...
[19:50:17] <Crimlo> then check the js file
[19:50:35] <hobs> it sounds like you have a handle on it
[19:50:45] <Crimlo> sounds like he does
[19:50:52] <Crimlo> lets talk about sexy brah
[19:50:55] <ajpiano> Pritchard: from what i can tell it's hardcoded into the plugin ://
[19:51:02] <Pritchard> Well that was easy.
[19:51:07] <Crimlo> see
[19:51:09] <Crimlo> good boy
[19:51:14] <Pritchard> ajpiano:  It's fine.  OSS people always expect me to edit the source, so I did.
[19:51:20] <ajpiano> they do?
[19:51:22] <Crimlo> just pay attention next time
[19:51:24] <Pritchard> At least I don't have to re-compile anything.
[19:51:34] <Pritchard> ajpiano:  Yeah.  It's their excuse for not building better software.
[19:51:53] <Crimlo> plugins are for losers
[19:51:57] <Pritchard> Oh well.  Nothing wrong with some custom tweaking.  Long as it isn't a back-breaker.
[19:52:17] <Crimlo> dude its not like you did something
[19:52:21] <Crimlo> get over yourself
[19:52:32] <ajpiano> Crimlo: can you perhaps be a little less... intense
[19:52:44] <ajpiano> for the good of people who are just passing through like Pritchard
[19:52:49] <Crimlo> its not my fault, i'm black.
[19:52:55] <ajpiano> that's the opposite of what i meant
[19:53:29] <Crimlo> we have a dynamic way of expressing ourselves
[19:53:48] <Crimlo> its in the genes brah
[19:53:56] <ajpiano> some are less good than others, for the time being i think you might need to have a little +q action
[19:54:17] <ajpiano> unless you can be a little kinder to the guests
[19:54:28] <ale_> Hello, I want to $('#div').scrollTop( $('#div').height() ); but it only works on FF, not on Chrome, does someone have any solution?
[19:54:32] <Crimlo> dude if it comes down to that i'll just leave
[19:54:42] <hobs> it might be a good idea if you are just trollin bro
[19:54:51] <Crimlo> i do not troll
[19:55:00] <Crimlo> i came to chill with you guys
[19:55:06] <Crimlo> stop being a dick brah
[19:55:23] <ajpiano> you realise there are actual places to chill on IRC besides public support forums
[19:55:32] <ajpiano> so
[19:55:33] <ajpiano> find them
[19:55:40] <Crimlo> suck a dick
[19:55:42] <ale_> stop chilling guys and give me a hand please!
[19:55:58] <hobs> lol
[19:56:21] <Eviltwin> ale_: Scroll to the bottom of the div?
[19:56:34] <ale_> Yes!
[19:56:34] <Eviltwin> ale_: Can you make a jsFiddle demo?
[19:56:50] <ale_> Yes, 1 sec
[19:56:57] <bartmax_> ale_: set overflow:auto or hidden to div
[19:57:50] <bartmax_> also try $(document).scrollTop( $('#div').height()
[19:58:17] <Pritchard> I'm glad this is such a lenient channel.
[19:58:45] <Eviltwin> Fortunately many of us are very patient people
[19:58:47] <Pritchard> Asking any kind of advice in here often turns up positive results :)
[19:58:53] <Pritchard> I appreciate that.
[19:59:53] <ale_> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/fDk5q/
[20:00:31] <Eviltwin> ale_: So you want the window to be scrolled to the bottom of the div?
[20:00:37] <ale_> Automatically
[20:01:00] <ale_> yes
[20:01:08] <Eviltwin> Have you looked at the scrollTo plugin?
[20:01:19] <ale_> No, I don't know it
[20:01:25] <ale_> We've never met before :P
[20:01:43] <Eviltwin> ?g jQuery scrollTo @ ale_
[20:01:44] <bot-t> ale_, jQuery.ScrollTo - http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[20:01:56] <Eviltwin> See if that's what you're looking for
[20:02:03] <ale_> Ok! 1 sec
[20:04:39] <ale_> Is there any other?
[20:05:03] <Eviltwin> It's the most feature-rich and smooth plugin I can think of for it
[20:05:06] <Eviltwin> What are you looking for?
[20:05:19] <ale_> I would prefer not to use a plguin
[20:05:22] <ale_> plugin*
[20:07:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/fDk5q/1/
[20:07:48] <Eviltwin> This scrolls so the bottom of the div is the top of the page
[20:08:24] <ale_> so none then?
[20:08:28] <ale_> oh let me see
[20:08:55] <Eviltwin> This scrolls so the bottom of the div is the bottom of the page: http://jsfiddle.net/fDk5q/2/
[20:09:19] <Eviltwin> It snaps there
[20:09:25] <Eviltwin> You can animate it with .animate
[20:12:02] <ale_> It's not working :S
[20:13:07] <Eviltwin> It's working fine here in three browsers
[20:13:48] <ale_> Maybe it's cache...hold on
[20:14:10] <Eviltwin> Note the numbers at the end
[20:15:32] <ale_> Yes I know...I don't get why it's not working
[20:16:00] <cgiGeek> .
[20:16:12] <Eviltwin> It should be scrolling to the bottom of the red one
[20:16:32] <cgiGeek> hi there, sorry need a clue here
[20:16:33] <cgiGeek> 		var content = $( data ).find( '#content' );
[20:16:34] <cgiGeek> 		$( "#displayPanelID" ).empty();
[20:16:34] <cgiGeek> 		$( "#displayPanelID" ).empty().append( data );
[20:16:34] <cgiGeek> 		});
[20:16:42] <Eviltwin> Please don't paste more than a line or two directly to IRC
[20:17:00] <cgiGeek> how can I ebal that the data is exists, is a port, when I try to eval it turns out is an object ,so is allways true.
[20:17:10] <cgiGeek> Eviltwin: sorry
[20:17:28] <cgiGeek> ebal=eval
[20:17:35] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the question. Can you try rephasing or making a demo?
[20:17:44] <Eviltwin> Preferably both
[20:19:11] <cgiGeek> hmm, I do a .post, then that is appended to a div, but I want to eval if there is a respone and the response in JS, as in reply can be: ok or bad or empty
[20:19:58] <ale_> I changed from <p> (which I actually had) to <div> and it's neither working
[20:20:31] <Eviltwin> The jsFiddle didn't work for you?
[20:23:36] <CrazyThinker> How can I select all kinds of tags with attribute name = "hi"
[20:23:49] <Eviltwin> Do you know the tag types?
[20:24:04] <CrazyThinker> I know for input we can use $('input[name="hi"])
[20:24:07] <Eviltwin> What you asked for would be $('*[name="hi"]') but it's a slow seletor
[20:24:20] <CrazyThinker> Eviltwin, It can be select, input or textarea
[20:24:21] <Eviltwin> Or simply $('[name="hi"]')
[20:24:51] <Eviltwin> $('select[name="hi"], input[name="hi"], textarea[name="hi"]') would probably be faster
[20:24:59] <CrazyThinker> Thanks
[20:50:10] <cgiGeek> the .post is returning a few new lines, I cannot see them on the response, tho, what I am doing wrong ?
[20:50:32] <Eviltwin> See?
[20:52:09] <cgiGeek> Eviltwin: thanks
[20:52:19] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[21:20:20] <pythonirc1011> I would like to render images (mostly icons) in a table, such that they don't look too big or too small. How can I calculate the width and height of each cell in the table using javascript. If it's a mobile phone browser, I want the table to be at most n x 2 (two columns), but it it's a 27" monitor, I would want it to be aroun n x 8 (8 columns). Is there something in JS that can already do this for me? I have seen smartcolumns..
[21:23:09] <Eviltwin> ?.width @ pythonirc1011
[21:23:17] <bot-t> pythonirc1011, .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[21:24:38] <Eviltwin> You may also want to consider using floating instead
[21:24:46] <Eviltwin> The #css folk can help you out with that
[21:26:43] <pythonirc1011> Eviltwin: So I find out width and then use a formula to calculate the total number of columns I want?
[21:26:58] <pythonirc1011> then use that to populate the image items/text in a table?
[21:27:06] <Eviltwin> Sure
[21:27:37] <pythonirc1011> Eviltwin: do you have any examples somewhere for this?
[21:33:38] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/ZcrGS/
[21:36:18] <Eviltwin> That was for you pythonirc1011
[22:27:54] <milardovich> Hello guys, I'm having problems with a jquery selector. Could you take a look at this? -> http://pellegrinioscarv.com.ar/listaprecios/listar_pedidos.php?id_rubro=1&id_subrubro=35&id_marca=5  Just click in "comprar", write something in the "cantidad value" and then click in the red button
[22:28:12] <milardovich> It's just an alert with the value from a field which really exists, but it always return null
[22:40:15] <cactuss> what are you asking for the val attribute on?  a div?
[22:40:30] <cactuss> oh the input
[22:40:32] <cactuss> oh
[22:40:40] <coldhead> oh!
[22:42:11] <cactuss> it's pretty hard to follow your code
[22:42:33] <milardovich> cactuss: the input
[22:42:38] <milardovich> But the input exists
[22:43:02] <milardovich> When I do alert(document.getElementById('cantidad-... it works
[22:43:08] <mindis|wurk> if it didn't exist it would returned undefined
[22:43:08] <milardovich> But I can't get the value
[22:43:21] <milardovich> mindis|wurk: Yes, that's right
[22:43:36] <milardovich> Sorry, the code isn't mine, I mean, I only needed to edit that for the job
[22:45:30] <milardovich> Any suggestions?
[22:50:18] <mindis|wurk> i suppose it might be a matter of a field of the same id appearing elsewhere but determining those seems a bit tricky since the page has over 500 errors when validated
[22:51:14] <coldhead> bahahah
[22:51:31] <mindis|wurk> though on a quick search in the source there doesn't appear to be any duplicates regarding that particular area
[23:04:11] <_ramo> hi
[23:04:41] <_ramo> how can i add default text to a textarea and clear it on click?
[23:07:14] <theBrettman> event.target.localname=undefined???
[23:07:59] <raj> how can I get the thickness of an inputbox's border?
[23:08:48] <raj> $(this).css('border-width') is returning an empty string
[23:09:12] <mindis|wurk> maybe it hasn't been explicitly defined. css is annoying in that way
[23:09:28] <mindis|wurk> ie. border 1px solid black or whatever
[23:10:26] <raj> it isn't
[23:10:35] <theBrettman> isn't what?
[23:10:41] <mindis|wurk> iirc i had a slightly similar case where i defined an objects width by using the left and right properties but it still had no width value when checked
[23:12:06] <raj> I have this code http://paste.ofcode.org/CUr7mUeFUBS9cycDKJXDKG to create a little autocomplete div here http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation
[23:12:09] <raj> login is asdf:asdf
[23:12:23] <raj> I'm trying to get the div exactly under the textbox
[23:12:37] <raj> to take into account any textbox
[23:13:02] <raj> if you click on the second Company input box, it should pop up
[23:13:18] <raj> sorry, refresh
[23:14:48] <raj> you'll see that it isn't at the bottom of the inputbox
[23:14:54] <raj> i dunno what's up with that
[23:15:49] <milardovich> mindis|wurk: that's not the problem. As you said, there isn't any duplicated ids
[23:17:32] <mindis|wurk> milardovich well, with that many errors you should probably fix the page itself anyway ;P
[23:18:40] <Assid> hi
[23:18:58] <milardovich> mindis|wurk: as I said before, the page isn't mine, I only need to fix that, so I don't care
[23:20:20] <Assid> so i have an issue with the datepicker.. i am unable to use setDate
[23:20:23] <Assid> it just doesnt want to work
[23:20:49] <Assid> i am able to use it without that just fine.. including a date format of yy-mm-dd
[23:21:09] <Assid> could someone kindly upload a demo page WITH yy-mm-dd and setDate
[23:29:29] <kostodo> Hi, I'm trying to make jQuery Cycle work with multiple slideshows on the same page
[23:29:42] <kostodo> as well as multiple prev/next handles for each slideshow
[23:29:49] <kostodo> Anyone mind having a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/Mbhf4/
[23:34:15] <Whirl3d> This is an odd (possibly stupid) question: with handling multiple events with .on, is there a way to always cache certain elements regardless of the event? In other words, each of my handlers (keypress, focusin, focusout) starts with: var targ=$(e.target)....Can I just do that once for the .on statement and have it cached for all events?
[23:36:26] <Whirl3d> kostodo, where are you getting the cycle method?
[23:36:35] <Whirl3d> ? .cycle
[23:36:36] <bot-t> Whirl3d, cycle - jQuery Plugin repository - Easy to use slideshow implementation. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many, many transition effects including fade, shuffle, scroll, turn... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cycle
[23:36:52] <kostodo> Whirl3d: well, yeah I didn't know how to load a plugin into jsfiddle
[23:37:01] <kostodo> but yes thats the right one that bot is churning up

[23:38:22] <kostodo> Whirl3d: done. try now
[23:38:35] <Whirl3d> did you update the fiddle?
[23:38:42] <kostodo> Yep
[23:39:04] <Whirl3d> it'll give you a new url, mind pasting it

[23:39:58] <mindis|wurk> sigh. i like how IE9 has to do every contenteditable selection feature differently from chrome and firefox
[23:39:59] <Whirl3d> sry. Should have figured that out.
[23:40:35] <kostodo> Basically my Prev/Next handles are being duplicated, and they are affecting all slideshows not just their own
[23:40:49] <Assid> i have an issue with the datepicker.. i am unable to use setDate , it just doesnt want to work,  i am able to use it without that just fine.. including a date format of yy-mm-dd; could someone kindly upload a demo page WITH yy-mm-dd and setDate
[23:42:07] <kostodo> Whirl3d: I managed to get one thing right: http://jsfiddle.net/Mbhf4/3/
[23:42:49] <kostodo> Whirl3d: but theres still duplication of handles and only the first Prev works
[23:47:36] <kostodo> Whirl3d: you there?
[23:47:49] <Assid> anyone care to help me with this?
[23:47:57] <Assid> please
[23:48:11] <Whirl3d> kostodo, I think it's your selector that you append to
[23:48:53] <Whirl3d> kostodo, your selector selects all of the lists and appends the prev and next. You need to append to $(this), I think...
[23:50:28] <Whirl3d> since you are using .each to cycle through and initialize each of the "slideshows", your selector appends the next and previous anchor elements to both lists "each" time you initialize
[23:50:56] <johnnyfortune> Hola Guys. I am making an $.ajax() request. The xhr.status is ok, the success function runs, but its running before the request finishes, and my data isn't getting displayed (but it does show up in firebug console).
[23:52:04] <kostodo> Whirl3d: mind editing the fiddle so that I can see what you mean?
[23:54:33] <Whirl3d> kostodo, brb
