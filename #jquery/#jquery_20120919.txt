[00:13:28] <davidado> Hello, how do i select the first child of a container using jquery?
[00:14:40] <zeropx> $(<target>).first();
[00:15:01] <zeropx> davidado: example $('#container ul li').first();
[00:15:22] <davidado> zeropx: hmm no that dont seem to work. i tried that
[00:15:42] <zeropx> can do $('#container ul li:first-child')
[00:15:48] <zeropx> just like css
[00:15:51] <davidado> zeropx: it seems that $('#threadContainer').children(":first") did the trick
[00:16:08] <zeropx> davidado: for future reference: http://api.jquery.com/first/
[00:16:12] <zeropx> first() works
[00:16:25] <zeropx> just need to make sure to use it as its supposed to
[00:27:44] <computer2000> guys which is the 'best' scss bundle for sublime text 2 pls?
[00:34:12] <zeropx> computer2000: I think there isn't much out here yet. I use the one from my Textmate https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle
[00:34:35] <computer2000> zeropx: ok
[01:05:44] <DeafGoose> hi guys, how do i get the current position of the dom where i insert a script tag that runs some jquery? I want to .append() however I want to find the current position to use as selector
[01:06:39] <mehrdad> hey can this be done in jquery? http://www.hamshahrilinks.org/Doclib/Hamshahri/index.html
[01:06:49] <mehrdad> and how much effort does it take?
[01:08:15] <mehrdad> as in are there plugins available to simplify the process ?
[01:09:14] <mehrdad> anyone?
[01:11:30] <zeropx> mehrdad: that would take some work
[01:11:48] <mehrdad> so it's possible
[01:11:51] <zeropx> mehrdad: I THINK that I have seen a source for it somewhere, but I can't really say for sure.
[01:12:00] <zeropx> mehrdad: yeah, very possible.
[01:12:04] <zeropx> actually done before.
[01:12:30] <mehrdad> searching for jquery newspaper hasn't returned anything useful yet
[01:12:53] <DeafGoose> hi guys, how do i get the current position of the dom where i insert a script tag that runs some jquery? I want to .append() however I want to find the current position to use as selector
[01:13:18] <Cork> DeafGoose: you don't
[01:13:28] <Cork> scripts doesn't have a position in dom
[01:13:34] <mehrdad> zeropx: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/5-free-jquery-page-flip-plugins-for-book-like-interfaces/
[01:13:35] <zeropx> mehrdad: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/5-free-jquery-page-flip-plugins-for-book-like-interfaces/
[01:13:37] <zeropx> HAHA
[01:13:40] <mehrdad> damn!
[01:13:41] <mehrdad> lol
[01:13:47] <zeropx> :P
[01:14:00] <mehrdad> awesome concurrency there :p
[01:14:02] <Cork> DeafGoose: you could search for all script tags in the dom and try to go from there, but thats just one gigantic hack
[01:14:07] <zeropx> mehrdad: that was very interesting
[01:14:25] <zeropx> mehrdad: there is this one too. http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/09/03/bookblock-a-content-flip-plugin/
[01:14:32] <zeropx> that was the original one I was remembering.
[01:14:36] <DeafGoose> Cork, how do I go about this then? I will be giving my users a script tag that will generate a banner, however I want them to be able to insert this anywhere within body and the banner will be created there
[01:15:01] <Cork> DeafGoose: add a container in the html blob they need to insert
[01:15:01] <DeafGoose> having a hard time trying to do this without a dom location
[01:15:11] <Cork> DeafGoose: and add the content in that container
[01:15:43] <Cork> <div id="your-release-name-specific-long-id"></div><script src=""></script>
[01:16:00] <mehrdad> the first plugin seems to require html5 support
[01:16:23] <DeafGoose> yea I thought about this but if they forget to insert that, then no ad will appear, I wanted a more elegant solution, for example google adsense just provides you a script tag and the ad shows right where u insert it
[01:16:25] <Cork> DeafGoose: then they can add your script from where ever they like
[01:16:41] <DeafGoose> maybe document.write?
[01:16:46] <Cork> DeafGoose: the way thats done is document.write ya
[01:16:51] <Cork> but you should never do that
[01:17:05] <Cork> its a horrible thing to handle from the developer of the site
[01:17:06] <mehrdad> zeropx: cool http://www.turnjs.com/#samples/magazine1/6
[01:17:13] <DeafGoose> hmm yea .write is so old school lol
[01:17:19] <mehrdad> i thought IE might suck at rendering it
[01:17:23] <mehrdad> i was wrong
[01:17:27] <Cork> DeafGoose: they have to try to handle your thing as a magic blob
[01:17:28] <DeafGoose> any alternatives to .write the jquery way?
[01:17:33] <Cork> and prob wrap it in a container anyway
[01:17:48] <Cork> DeafGoose: you shouldn't be using document.write; period
[01:17:52] <Cork> so no no jquery way
[01:18:00] <Cork> the jquery way is to use the dom
[01:18:15] <DeafGoose> hmm
[01:18:16] <mehrdad> it looks a little jerky at times though
[01:18:17] <Cork> document.write doens't know or work with the dom
[01:18:18] <zeropx> mehrdad: yeah, this one I have seen too. I don't do much for IE experience anymore. :D
[01:18:20] <mehrdad> not bad
[01:18:22] <Cork> its too old for that
[01:18:25] <zeropx> mehrdad: I make it accessible, thats it. :D
[01:18:43] <DeafGoose> i should be able to get the current position via jquery damm this sucks
[01:18:54] <Cork> DeafGoose: when i get a script that magically add things around its script tag, i always wrap them in a container anyway
[01:18:56] <mehrdad> yeah, i just want to make sure IE does support it, which it does
[01:19:00] <Cork> just to be able to isolate it
[01:19:03] <zeropx> nice
[01:19:13] <Cork> DeafGoose: so you can just as well bake that into your api
[01:19:16] <DeafGoose> sure, that way is the nicest way
[01:19:30] <Cork> DeafGoose: your missing a point
[01:19:45] <Cork> DeafGoose: scripts have no reference in dom what so ever
[01:19:52] <zeropx> mehrdad: Cool effect, but very impractical as a users point of view unless effects and unique experience is what is expected for end user.
[01:19:53] <DeafGoose> hmm got it
[01:19:57] <Cork> document.write has special magic hacks in it to make it work
[01:20:06] <Cork> DeafGoose: there is one, semi ok way to do it
[01:20:19] <mehrdad> there's this tiny bit flash version does better: i can grab any part of the paper and flip the page
[01:20:52] <mehrdad> zeropx: yeah, i want it for a catalog book
[01:20:52] <zeropx> mehrdad: is there a need for this to work on devices? pads, tablets, phones etc?
[01:20:59] <Cork> DeafGoose: do if($('#my-special-long-id').length < 1) { document.write('<div id="my-special-long-id"></div>'); }
[01:20:59] <mehrdad> no
[01:21:05] <zeropx> mehrdad: thats good.
[01:21:10] <Cork> DeafGoose: that way you can fallback to creating the div if its missing
[01:21:19] <Cork> and do the rest in a clean maner
[01:21:24] <DeafGoose> hmm nice
[01:21:28] <Cork> and if the user adds the element, you don't need to
[01:21:46] <DeafGoose> this sounds good
[01:21:47] <mehrdad> i imagine that's a shitload of absolute divs in there
[01:22:54] <DeafGoose> Cork found this article, a bit old though: http://www.sitepoint.com/insert-in-place-without-documentwrite/
[01:23:31] <mehrdad> zeropx: oh snap!
[01:23:41] <zeropx> ?
[01:23:48] <Cork> DeafGoose: ya, that depends on having an id on the script tag
[01:23:49] <mehrdad> it's... commercial....kinda expected
[01:23:56] <mehrdad> gotta try the others
[01:24:00] <DeafGoose> yea i didnt know script tags could have ids lol
[01:24:02] <Cork> DeafGoose: and... that would work in jquery too
[01:24:10] <Cork> DeafGoose: any element can have an id
[01:24:11] <zeropx> mehrdad: oh. LOL
[01:24:18] <zeropx> mehrdad: go figure. :D
[01:24:44] <DeafGoose> lol, so I guess I can just provide an id to the script tag and insert .after
[01:24:56] <Cork> DeafGoose: after a bit of thinking, useing $('#script-id') as a fallback would be better then document.write
[01:25:20] <Cork> DeafGoose: but do the fallback solution i said before, so the developer is free to make there page clean
[01:25:23] <zeropx> mehrdad: can still try it and if client likes it they could pay for it.
[01:25:37] <DeafGoose> $('scripttd')..insertAfter(ad here) ?
[01:25:41] <mehrdad> useless unless i can pay too :p
[01:25:56] <DeafGoose> yea I think ur solution is better
[01:26:01] <mehrdad> that was a bummer :/
[01:26:07] <zeropx> mehrdad: I see. :D :(
[01:26:12] <DeafGoose> if google does it :p
[01:26:18] <Cork> DeafGoose: thats the oposit direction
[01:26:33] <Cork> DeafGoose: thats to insert the script tag after the ad :)
[01:26:41] <DeafGoose> :)
[01:26:53] <DeafGoose> my bad
[01:26:54] <Cork> DeafGoose: another reason to think about providing a way to not be script location only
[01:27:01] <mehrdad> now investigating jpageflip
[01:27:07] <Cork> DeafGoose: is that you can't add that through jquery
[01:27:08] <mehrdad> can't find the demo...
[01:27:25] <Cork> DeafGoose: jquery filter out script tags from html and always add them to the head
[01:27:44] <Cork> DeafGoose: thats another reason why you should provide the other solution
[01:27:53] <DeafGoose> good point
[01:28:09] <mehrdad> found it
[01:28:16] <zeropx> goodnite:D
[01:28:24] <zeropx> 1:30am must sleep!
[01:29:10] <DeafGoose> Thanks Cork for your insight
[01:29:17] <Cork> np
[01:29:19] <mehrdad> ah good night zeropx
[01:29:45] <DeafGoose> after jq loads, I will check for the presence of the tag as you suggested and if not there, just document.write it
[01:29:45] <mehrdad> btw second one's demo doesn't work
[01:29:57] <mehrdad> guess i better try the next ones
[01:30:09] <mehrdad> hopefully it won't take it to the fifth
[01:30:36] <Cork> DeafGoose: i think i would actually try to use an id on the script tag
[01:30:47] <Cork> DeafGoose: that has less risk of messing up the page
[01:32:08] <grifx> helo
[01:32:12] <grifx> hello
[01:32:20] <grifx> What means that :  $( "<div/>" ).text
[01:32:31] <grifx>  $( "<div/>" ).text( '<li>' + message + '</li>').prependTo( "#log" );
[01:33:10] <Cork> grifx: it adds a div with the text "<li>some message</li>" in it and appends it to the element with the id #log
[01:33:25] <Cork> *it creates a div
[01:33:36] <grifx> hmm ok
[01:33:44] <grifx> <div> and </div>
[01:33:46] <grifx> and ?
[01:33:49] <Cork> yes
[01:33:50] <grifx> Cork:
[01:33:52] <grifx> ahcool
[01:33:54] <Cork> <div/> is the short hand
[01:33:55] <grifx> thanks you
[01:33:58] <Cork> np
[01:34:07] <grifx> can i use <li/> ?
[01:34:15] <Cork> yes
[01:34:18] <grifx> ok
[01:34:38] <Cork> grifx: but remember that one adds li as text not as a li element
[01:34:53] <grifx> ah ok
[01:35:05] <Cork> that would be $( "<div/>" ).html( '<li>' + message + '</li>').prependTo( "#log" );
[01:35:27] <Cork> or $( "<div/>" ).append( $('<li/>').text(message)).prependTo( "#log" );
[01:35:56] <Cork> well html would work instead of append in the last one too
[01:36:54] <mazzachre> is it even legal adding a li element to a div?!
[01:37:04] <Cork> ah! good point
[01:37:05] <Cork> its not
[01:37:11] <mazzachre> I thought so
[01:37:15] <Cork> didn't even think of that
[01:37:23] <Cork> so $( "<ul/>" ).append( $('<li/>').text(message)).prependTo( "#log" );
[01:37:24] <Cork> :)
[01:37:54] <mazzachre> Most browsers would probably let you anyway, but the html police would drag you from your computer and publicly humiliate you :p
[01:38:10] <Cork> all would
[01:38:18] <Cork> its part of the html error correction
[01:38:34] <Cork> it would convert it to <div><ul><li></li></ul></div>
[01:39:05] <mazzachre> I would be quite alone in this office after the purge... I have seen so my wtfs in the code I have been given to maintain that it is amazing...
[01:39:18] <CodesStuff> "Most browsers would probably let you anyway, but the html police would drag you from your computer and publicly humiliate you "
[01:39:23] <CodesStuff> Made me giggle
[01:39:39] <CodesStuff> which woke my dog up and now she wants to be on my lap watching me code
[01:39:49] <Cork> mazzachre: actually the worst part is when you try to access it through the way you created it and it doesn't match :)
[01:40:00] <Cork> mazzachre: cause the error correction has created extra parents
[01:41:05] <Cork> one good example i've seen countless times is $('tr').eq(10).before('<h2>header</h2>');
[01:41:21] <Cork> and then they sit confused and wonder why its positioned before the table :)
[01:41:47] <CodesStuff> Why are you using tables?
[01:41:52] <CodesStuff> :P
[01:41:57] <Cork> cause its a talbe of content?
[01:42:08] <grifx> How can I make an alert of an object element
[01:42:10] <Cork> all situations when you use a table isn't wrong :)
[01:42:14] <CodesStuff> Why are you displaying content?
[01:42:16] <Cork> grifx: no
[01:42:19] <CodesStuff> (you got me, cork)
[01:42:20] <CodesStuff> XD
[01:42:23] <mazzachre> tables are very good for tabular data
[01:42:34] <grifx> Cork: How can I see the element
[01:42:43] <Cork> grifx: console.log
[01:42:55] <grifx> console.log($(this));
[01:42:55] <Cork> grifx: look in your developer console and it will output the structure
[01:42:56] <grifx> ?
[01:42:59] <Cork> yes
[01:42:59] <grifx> ok
[01:43:01] <CodesStuff> grifx: alert(document.getElementById('div_id').innerHTML);
[01:43:11] <CodesStuff> or console.log the object as cork said
[01:43:25] <Cork> don't kill the kittens!
[01:43:29] <Cork> ;p
[01:43:34] <mazzachre> except in our system... here all layout is done with tables, and tabular data is shown in left floated divs in clearing divs of specific set sizes... I am still amazed
[01:43:40] <Cork> a kitten dies and all that >_>
[01:43:46] <CodesStuff> ^
[01:44:02] <CodesStuff> Call me the kitten hitler, then.
[01:44:07] <CodesStuff> Adolf Kitler
[01:44:19] <Cork> mazzachre: had to take care of code like that too
[01:44:32] <Cork> mazzachre: one of them used clear:both A LOT
[01:44:36] <mazzachre> console.log is very good, if you are developing using firefox, just don't forget to remove all instances of it prior to release if your customers use IE
[01:44:48] <Cork> and ... that was interesting making thinks float in the side columns
[01:44:53] <CodesStuff> or typeof console
[01:45:08] <CodesStuff> and only run .log if console is present
[01:45:16] <Cork> mazzachre: you sould always remove it prior to release
[01:45:27] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, we have that too...
[01:45:30] <Cork> mazzachre: pumling lines to the console slows down the page
[01:45:47] <mazzachre> Cork: Obviously... anyway debug info is not for users in any case
[01:45:54] <Cork> and if you output much its actually by a lot
[01:46:01] <grifx> I want to get the id attribute
[01:46:17] <Cork> grifx: this.id ?
[01:46:19] <grifx> $(this).attr('id')
[01:46:24] <CodesStuff> mazzachre: On some of my larger sites I leave little console.log easter eggs on certain pages
[01:46:40] <Cork> grifx: whats this pointing to?
[01:46:41] <CodesStuff> Usually with messages like, "You have won a prize! Regret."
[01:47:29] <mazzachre> CodesStuff: I placed an esteregg in the log output of a mainframe app once, saying "This software requires microsoft windows to run"
[01:47:55] <CodesStuff> lolwut
[01:47:57] <CodesStuff> That's silly
[01:48:00] <mazzachre> :)
[01:48:18] <NielsNL> hello all, i have an issue with showing a model dialog in IE9 while it is working on the jqueryUI site and on other browsers,
[01:48:18] <NielsNL> Would someone know of any issues or want to have a look at our test site and give me some hint's why this happens?
[01:48:37] <CodesStuff> I'd help you but I don't want to launch IE.
[01:48:42] <mazzachre> Anyone who have been around in the old dos days and transformation to widnows 3 and forward would recognise that message :p
[01:49:05] <grifx> CodesStuff: it's undefined with the .id
[01:49:10] <CodesStuff> mazzachre: I'm 21
[01:49:19] <CodesStuff> grifx: Make a jsfiddle?
[01:49:20] <mazzachre> Ah
[01:49:40] <grifx> works with .attr('id')
[01:49:43] <grifx> so it's okay
[01:49:48] <Cork> grifx: what is this?
[01:50:05] <grifx> $(this).attr('id');
[01:50:10] <Cork> grifx: what is this?
[01:50:14] <grifx> ah
[01:50:16] <grifx> lol
[01:50:16] <Cork> what element does it point to
[01:50:21] <grifx> input
[01:50:25] <Cork> ah
[01:50:27] <NielsNL> CodesStuff: any suggestions on how to find the issue?
[01:50:31] <Cork> then this.id should work
[01:50:54] <CodesStuff> NielsNL: F12 in IE and open the dev console. Does it spit out any arrors?
[01:51:01] <CodesStuff> errors*
[01:51:06] <CodesStuff> Not sure how I screwed that one up.
[01:51:13] <NielsNL> thanks i will check
[01:51:22] <Cork> NielsNL: make sure you don't have any trailing commas in your objects
[01:51:52] <Cork> NielsNL: thats one of the absolut most common causes when ie doesn't the same code works in other browsers (now days)
[01:52:07] <Cork> *when the same code doesn't work
[01:54:44] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone im still working on a redirect thingy in jquery but cannot figure out how to pass a param to a function
[01:54:56] <jarr0dsz> i have like this $('#counter').countdown({until: '+10s', format: 'S', significant: 3, onExpiry: reload_div}); how do i pass a variable in the reload_div function call?
[01:55:04] <jarr0dsz> just ('location') doesent work
[01:55:46] <Cork> jarr0dsz: $('#counter').countdown({until: '+10s', format: 'S', significant: 3, onExpiry: function() { reload_div(argument); }});
[01:56:27] <jarr0dsz> okay inside a function call like that thx Cork
[01:58:06] <lilleman> Can I use XPath for selecting instead of CSS-syntax?
[01:58:18] <NielsNL> Cork: can you give an example, not sure what you mean
[01:58:28] <Cork> lilleman: not in the jquery selector no
[01:58:32] <lilleman> :(
[01:58:59] <Cork> NielsNL: ex {title:'something',width:'100px',}
[01:59:09] <Cork> NielsNL: that will work in all browsers except ie
[01:59:14] <Cork> that will have a parser crash
[01:59:29] <Cork> NielsNL: change that to {title:'something',width:'100px'}
[01:59:34] <Cork> and all browsers are happy
[01:59:50] <Cork> same with arrays
[02:00:06] <NielsNL> okay, as what CodesStuff suggested i tested it with the dev console.
[02:00:29] <NielsNL> and there where no errors shown
[02:00:56] <Cork> you have a link?
[02:01:17] <NielsNL> i pm it to you okay?
[02:01:26] <Cork> one sec
[02:01:45] <Cork> ok go for it
[02:02:39] <Cork> NielsNL: i don't not have access to your localhost
[02:02:43] <Cork> ;P
[02:03:29] <dax_roc> Morning all
[02:03:43] <Cork> :w
[02:03:45] <NielsNL> lol Cork
[02:03:48] <Cork> opps wrong window
[02:06:01] <dax_roc> I'm trying to auto scroll to the bottom on a container with $(selector).stop().animate({scrollTop: $(selector).height()},100); It works until the scrollable area is greater than the original container height?
[02:07:16] <Cork> dax_roc: use scrollHeight
[02:07:31] <Cork> ?mdn scrollHeight
[02:07:36] <Cork> ?mds scrollHeight
[02:07:47] <Cork> bah.. bot-t is down again...
[02:12:26] <grifx>             $(function() {                 $('.close').click(function(){                     $(this).parent('li').remove();                     alert('lol');                 })
[02:12:30] <grifx> that isn't working
[02:13:06] <grifx> is it a probleme if my .clode element doesn't exist when the function is load
[02:13:07] <grifx> ?
[02:13:17] <dax_roc> Cork: Appreciate it.
[02:14:15] <seutje> grifx: yes, it is a problem
[02:14:39] <seutje> grifx: use on() on a parent element that doesn't change
[02:15:02] <seutje> pass the .close selector as second argument
[02:15:02] <grifx> onClick ?
[02:15:08] <seutje> ?on @ grifx
[02:15:31] <seutje> b-ot: snoozing?
[02:15:31] <b-ot> seutje, better not tell you now.
[02:15:45] <seutje> grifx: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:15:50] <Cork> grifx: is that for you dialog?
[02:15:53] <Cork> the .close i mean?
[02:16:17] <Cork> ui dialogs has a built in callback handler for the close action for the dialog
[02:16:25] <Cork> (it catches the x button in the top right too)
[02:16:42] <grifx> ah ok
[02:16:53] <grifx> yes
[02:17:49] <grifx> where can i find the close x
[02:18:06] <Cork> grifx: you don't need to
[02:18:08] <Cork> like i said
[02:18:31] <Cork> $().dialog({ close: function() { /* this is called when the dialog is closed */ } }
[02:19:02] <Cork> or $().on('dialogclose', function() { /* same thing, but outside the dialog init code */ });
[02:19:31] <jarr0dsz> Cork:  maybe you know, i have now this call   $('#counter3').countdown({until: '+3s', format: 'S', significant: 3, onExpiry: function() { reload_div('1')}}); wich works fine. but its tied to the div #counter3
[02:19:43] <grifx> And who add the '<span class="close">x</span>' ?
[02:19:46] <jarr0dsz> would it be possible to have such a countdown without the need for a div in the html? like just having a function to call it?
[02:20:07] <jarr0dsz> im using this plugin http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html great one btw, but cannot figure out how to tie the countdown loose from a div attached
[02:21:09] <Cork> grifx: as far as i know thats there by default
[02:21:23] <grifx> I dont' know
[02:21:26] <Cork> grifx: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ <--
[02:21:32] <Cork> that x button you see there
[02:21:45] <grifx> ah but it's not a dialog sorry
[02:21:51] <grifx> it's a dialog like
[02:22:01] <grifx> just with a word
[02:22:10] <Cork> so "grifx: is that for you dialog?" is a no then :)
[02:22:27] <grifx> sorry i didn't understood
[02:22:54] <NielsNL> thanks cork for pointing to the issue it is now working again
[02:23:11] <Cork> NielsNL: funny that it was so simple :)
[02:23:40] <Cork> grifx: ah now i see, i mixed your case up with NielsNL's one :/
[02:23:42] <Cork> sorry about that
[02:26:17] <NielsNL> Cork: yes but i'm really happy it was that simple.
[02:26:35] <grifx>             $(function() {                 $('.close').on('click', function(){                     alert('test');                 });
[02:26:39] <grifx> that isn't working
[02:28:20] <NielsNL> grifx: are you testing with firefox/firebug? does it show any errors?
[02:28:30] <grifx> no erros
[02:29:49] <NielsNL> can you paste your code to http://jsfiddle.net ?
[02:30:15] <Cork> grifx: $(document).on('click', '.close', function() {});
[02:31:24] <NielsNL> Cork is that the new way of adding events?
[02:31:42] <Cork> its the new way of doing delegated event listners
[02:32:04] <Cork> $(document).delegate('.close', 'click', function() {}); is the same thing before 1.7
[02:32:33] <grifx> it's not working too
[02:32:36] <Cork> $('.close').live('click', function() {}); is the depricated live solution
[02:32:39] <grifx> I can't use jsfiddle
[02:32:51] <Cork> grifx: then you don't have an element with the class .close
[02:33:03] <grifx> i've got
[02:33:06] <Cork> grifx: what version of jquery are you using?
[02:33:11] <grifx> 1.8.x
[02:33:29] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/Xf9PN/
[02:33:30] <Xtreme> hey guys. i am using $.get()
[02:33:34] <Cork> grifx: if (document).on('click', '.close', function() {}); doesn't match it
[02:33:36] <Xtreme> what can i do if it fails?
[02:33:39] <Cork> the class is just not there
[02:33:46] <Xtreme> i mean how to check if that file exists or not
[02:34:16] <grifx> Cork: the class exist when i create the element
[02:34:19] <Cork> Xtreme: you use $.ajax so you can catch the error/failed event
[02:34:23] <grifx> no onload of the page
[02:34:25] <Cork> s/event/callback/
[02:34:37] <tt-user> hey guys, can you please have a look at a problem im facing with an anonymous function as plugin parameter: http://jsfiddle.net/e5NkM/1/ thanks
[02:34:45] <Xtreme> Cork, thanks.. looking into it
[02:34:47] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/Xf9PN/1/
[02:34:56] <grifx> Cork: My whole code sorry
[02:35:04] <Xtreme> $.get got nothing or error Cork
[02:35:08] <Cork> grifx: jsfiddle only wants the section inside body in the html section
[02:35:23] <grifx> ok
[02:35:41] <tapout> I link to google's hosted jquery and jquery ui, .. and then I cut/paste the 'tabs' example and it doesn't render... anyone know why?
[02:35:42] <Cork> so put the js links in the library tags
[02:35:51] <Cork> grifx: and the js in the javascript section
[02:35:59] <Cork> and the css in the css section
[02:37:09] <Cork> tt-user: your using a timer or animation?
[02:37:19] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/Xf9PN/2/
[02:37:21] <Cork> or something like xhr
[02:37:29] <grifx> Cork: but i'm using jquery ui
[02:38:20] <tt-user> i do use a timeout to delay display of the tooltip
[02:39:37] <grifx> that works
[02:39:40] <grifx> Cork: THANKS
[02:39:45] <grifx> I'm dumb sorry
[02:40:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Xf9PN/4/
[02:40:27] <Xtreme> i am $(".down").click(test1()); in $(document).ready().
[02:40:44] <Xtreme> but everytime i load the page, it gets accessed.. bufore click
[02:40:47] <Xtreme> why is it like that?
[02:40:48] <Cork> Xtreme: thats not valid
[02:40:58] <Cork> unless test1() returns a function
[02:41:03] <Xtreme> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp
[02:41:10] <Cork> that is function test1() { return function() {} };
[02:41:24] <Xtreme> so Cork how can i do it?
[02:41:27] <Cork> Xtreme: never ever EVER use w3schools as reference
[02:41:38] <Xtreme> Cork, thanks :)
[02:41:45] <Cork> $(".down").click(test1); in $(document).ready().
[02:41:53] <Xtreme> cool, 1 sec :)
[02:41:54] <Cork> that will call test1 when .down is clicked
[02:42:17] <Cork> test1() actually runs the function when its encountered
[02:42:35] <Xtreme> damn.. i never knew this
[02:43:48] <tt-user> Cork: do you know why the timeout interfers with the function in ie only?
[02:43:48] <Xtreme> Cork,  my script url is ftp:///sdcard/1.html
[02:43:51] <Xtreme> can i put the same?
[02:44:10] <Cork> tt-user: cause timers always run in the global scope in ie
[02:44:33] <Cork> can't access your sdcard ;P
[02:44:38] <Cork> Xtreme: ^
[02:44:48] <Cork> and yes you can reuse the same function
[02:44:55] <tt-user> is there some sort of workaround?
[02:45:05] <Cork> there is
[02:45:08] <Xtreme> Cork, this is phonegap.. they are re-routing ftp:/// to memory
[02:45:14] <Cork> one sec let me try to find a page about it
[02:46:24] <Cork> ah, right
[02:46:36] <Cork> heh funny when you forget these things :)
[02:47:02] <Xtreme> so can i just put ftp:///sdcard/1.html as url?
[02:47:06] <Xtreme> i did same for $.get
[02:47:42] <tt-user> Cork: if i just add an parameter to the function and pass the array into the function by that?
[02:47:45] <Cork> tt-user: http://www.skinkers.com/2011/05/31/fixing-internet-explorers-settimeout-setinterval-scoping-issues-and-overcome-apisframeworks-that-dont-allow-arguments-to-be-passed-to-callback-methods/ is one examoke
[02:48:00] <Pietertje> hi
[02:48:03] <Cork> tt-user: that should work ya
[02:48:11] <Pietertje> i need to make object array
[02:48:15] <Pietertje> how can i define the object
[02:48:20] <tt-user> okay thanks for the links anyways :-)
[02:48:23] <tt-user> *link
[02:48:37] <Cork> Xtreme: as far as i know, yes, though that might actaully get cross domain blocked
[02:48:56] <Cork> pierreee: you need to make an object or an array
[02:49:08] <Cork> theres not really a combo :)
[02:49:15] <Morkel> What is a good TDD Framework for JS development with jquery?
[02:52:59] <Pietertje> cork : dont speak if you dont know..
[02:53:21] <Cork> pierreee: express your self so ppl have a clue what you mean
[02:54:07] <Pietertje> its ok
[03:00:13] <pingec> http://pingec.si/jQuerySelectorFails.png Any ideas why this fails? This is inside an iframe
[03:01:02] <quicksilver> pingec: #RequestForm *is* a form.
[03:01:06] <quicksilver> it doesn't have another form inside it.
[03:01:07] <Cork> pingec: your trying to select a form inside a form?
[03:01:15] <quicksilver> which is what your two selectors try to do
[03:01:51] <pingec> oh damn i prepared the wrong example
[03:01:54] <pingec> sec
[03:05:02] * Cork gives bot-t a botsnack
[03:06:30] <pingec> What about now: http://pingec.si/jQuerySelectorFails.png
[03:06:37] <pingec> Why does it fail via id?
[03:08:02] <pingec> How can I debug this?
[03:08:02] <Cork> pingec: what do you get from $('[id="RequestForm"]').length ?
[03:08:18] <pingec> 1
[03:08:29] <Cork> interesting...
[03:09:05] <Cork> and $.fn.jquery ?
[03:09:25] <pingec> 1.7.2
[03:09:39] <Cork> thats.... really interesting...
[03:09:44] <pingec> Same selector works in main document but not in iframe (they have same html structure)
[03:09:57] <Cork> ow wait
[03:10:07] <Cork> have you escaped your json in the input values?
[03:10:28] <Cork> or is it really <input value="{"text"}">
[03:10:37] <oidroG> hi
[03:10:45] <pingec> hm
[03:10:47] <oidroG> is there a plugin for virtual machines?
[03:10:52] <pingec> In the main document it is all escaped
[03:10:59] <pingec> but i clone it to the iframe with jquery
[03:11:03] <Cork> ok, so its just how crome displays it
[03:11:05] <pingec> so maybe that breaks it?
[03:11:11] <Cork> don't think so
[03:11:33] <Cork> $('#RequestForm').children().length
[03:12:49] <Cork> pingec: that said though, you should try to keep your id's in lower case
[03:12:57] <pingec> 3
[03:13:09] <Cork> wtf...
[03:13:15] <Cork> ok
[03:13:22] <Cork> pingec: can you change the id?
[03:13:23] <pingec> Ok I can try lowercase
[03:13:26] <pingec> yes
[03:13:28] <Cork> yup
[03:13:42] <pingec> it will take a few mins
[03:13:43] <pingec> brb
[03:13:43] <Cork> i think that has to be messing with sizzles head
[03:18:12] <pingec> Cork yeah, now it works!
[03:18:23] <Cork> heh
[03:18:24] <pingec> thanks, wouldn't have figured that out on my own
[03:18:32] * Cork takes a note on that one
[03:18:42] <Cork> pingec: np
[03:19:00] <quicksilver> Cork: are IDs really not suposed to contain uppercase?
[03:19:02] * quicksilver did not know that
[03:19:33] <pingec> So I should avoid upper case?
[03:19:35] <Cork> quicksilver: there was quite a lot of rules for id's pre html5
[03:19:38] <Cork> yes
[03:19:51] <Cork> quicksilver: in html5 onwards though theres almost no rules what so ever
[03:20:09] <Cork> i think it forbids space and " but thats about it
[03:20:53] <Cork> pingec: the yes was for you btw :)
[03:21:03] <pingec> ok
[03:21:43] <pingec> That's going to be a lot of refactoring :D
[03:21:49] <pingec> Why didn't I know that :o
[03:22:17] <Cork> to be honest i think sizzle should change
[03:22:25] <Cork> as the rules has changed for id's
[03:23:00] <Xtreme> guys, i need to process a XML file using get. i fixed get part with the help of Cork, now is there any shortcut to process that XML? i am using $.ajax. (PS:- Important:- i am not a JS or Jquery guy, i am a php guy.)
[03:23:34] <Cork> Xtreme: dataType: 'xml'
[03:23:40] <blackspotwiggins> Xtreme, it's easy to tell. you can parse xml with jquery normally
[03:24:49] <Xtreme> Cork, data: xmlDocument will work?
[03:25:03] <Cork> Xtreme: jquery will parse the document for you
[03:25:18] <Cork> you will get a dom document pointing to the xml dom
[03:25:54] <Xtreme> Cork, cool.. this is more what i like :)
[03:26:26] <Cork> Xtreme: its quite important that the server sends the correct content-type though
[03:27:09] <Xtreme> so in xmlRequest.done(handleResponse); what exactly i will get in handleResponse, and i need  processData: true right?? (yup, i am only sending it :)
[03:27:44] <Cork> done won't get the converted data
[03:27:50] <Cork> only success gets it
[03:28:06] <Cork> oh wait they renamed those
[03:28:13] <Cork> done is success >_>
[03:28:29] <Cork> Xtreme: the first argument will be the reference to the dom
[03:28:44] <Cork> when jquery matches up the types that is :)
[03:30:02] <Cork> and with that i'm off for lunch
[03:30:34] <Xtreme> thanks:) bye
[03:30:38] <Xtreme> see you later on
[03:38:31] <rgr> whats the term for the expression "$()" ?
[03:40:26] <pingec> Should I make iframe names lowercase-only also?
[03:40:28] <farodado> Whats the best practice for creating a global object?
[03:40:44] <dax_roc> rgr: jQuery
[03:41:05] <rgr> right..
[03:41:20] <rgr> I guess I was wondering if their was a descriptive adjective for it.
[03:41:23] <rgr> there
[03:42:14] <rgr> and its not anyway since $().func is not the same as jQuery.func
[03:42:42] <rgr> farodado: dont us evar?
[03:42:47] <rgr> use var
[03:42:58] <rgr> or window.varname=globalvalue
[03:43:07] <pHero> hello, how can i make a list with lists as its elements?
[03:43:15] <pHero> need to save one-to-many relationship
[03:43:21] <pHero> in js/jquery
[03:43:43] <dax_roc> rgr: $ is the 'namespace' () calls it as an anonomus function,  some one more knoledgable jumpin please
[03:44:14] <farodado> rgr: yeah ok....the thing is that i am at page load doing an ajax call to fetch the logged on user-object from the server....then in the callback i can set window.varname...problem is that i then don't know when it will be available....I need this object available from everywhere from the very beginning
[03:44:15] <rgr> oh thats enough to get me googling -thanks. I want to understand the details a little more at this stage
[03:44:50] <rgr> then set it at the original page generation.
[03:45:06] <rgr> the ajax async callbacl can only modify it.
[03:45:30] <jomofcw> Why using $radioElements.val([13]); under IE doesnt select the radio[value=13] in the set of element, and after this each radio of the set of element return me 13 when I display $radioElement.val(); ? please :/...
[03:53:08] <rgr> jomofcw: I'm intrigued as to to what you think that line means.
[04:16:33] <greygoo> hello world ?
[04:16:38] <greygoo> is this working ?
[04:17:00] <greygoo> ping ?
[04:17:43] <greygoo> how do i remove all the objects that uses the "defcon" class ?
[04:18:02] <greygoo> many divs are dynamically created using the class "defcon"
[04:18:11] <greygoo> but i want to clean stuffs up
[04:18:17] <greygoo> by deleting all of them
[04:18:24] <greygoo> any ideas ?
[04:19:01] <greygoo> eum hello ?
[04:19:17] <greygoo> !ping
[04:19:21] <b-ot> greygoo, pong
[04:19:41] <quicksilver> $('.defcon').remove();
[04:20:13] <greygoo> oh!
[04:22:16] <greygoo> this place used to be crawling with people
[04:22:27] <greygoo> now its just silent most of the time
[04:22:48] <greygoo> what is there a new javascript framework that is trending ?
[04:23:04] <quicksilver> I dunno. 10 pages of 60 lines in the last 2 hours
[04:23:06] <quicksilver> not really silent
[04:23:10] <quicksilver> just having a quiet moment
[04:23:12] <SomeoneWeird> nope just not everyone is talking :)
[04:38:44] <sakro_> hello, i have a script in which i am changing css of a div left: xx; but i want that image to move top as well, but its not happening
[04:43:13] <Cork> ?p @ sakro_
[04:43:14] <bot-t> sakro_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:46:21] <ha6aha6a> hello. noob here. i am trying to create a script that counts the number of time i click a button. i click a button once and i want the number 1 to appear under the button. i click the button again and instead of the 1 and want 2 to appear. i am able to make it work sort of. the value is displayd but only for a second. after that it goes back to the initial value that i put there in the html...
[04:46:22] <ha6aha6a> ...code. how can i make the value of clicks stick?
[04:49:23] <greygoo> ha6aha6a: eum you want to persist the code after browser reload ?
[04:49:32] <greygoo> or just the current browser session ?
[04:50:01] <sakro_> cork: http://bmm.websiterocks.com/
[04:50:04] <sakro_> the jeep image
[04:50:13] <ha6aha6a> greygoo: i gues just browser session
[04:51:33] <greygoo> ha6aha6a: then var clicks = 0; $("#button").click = clicks = clicks + 1; document.write clicks
[04:51:36] <greygoo> its just the algo
[04:51:40] <rgr> anyone here that uses chrome know how to get the search field back down in the debugger/inspector? Its not top right as it normally is here on my main desktop. Fine on my laptop.
[04:51:52] <greygoo> you just replace it with the correct api
[04:52:02] <Cork> sakro_: the jeep moves in both directions for me
[04:52:38] <rgr> whay document.write clicks?
[04:52:48] <sakro_> cork: its doing both top and left ?
[04:53:08] <Cork> sakro_: it did until i reloaded yet
[04:53:15] <Cork> now it doesn't move any direction
[04:53:16] <greygoo> or you can use $("#otherdiv).html = clicks
[04:53:23] <sakro_> i didnt change anything now :s
[04:53:23] <greygoo> rgr: happy ?
[04:53:35] <ha6aha6a> greygoo: thanks i will try it
[04:53:35] <Cork> ah wait it haven't finnished loading yet
[04:53:44] <Cork> the server is really slow
[04:53:57] <rgr> well, one is jquery the other isnt. And I'd use .text().
[04:54:27] <greygoo> rgr: well in the end we are both accomplishing the same stuffs, i am just dirty with my code :P
[04:54:35] <ravenz> can I actually access the event object without using a callback function ? .on('click', '.foo', foo.call($(this), event)) ?
[04:54:52] <Cork> ravenz: yes
[04:54:59] <rgr> well, assuming he asked here for a reason I doubt his tutor would like document.write in a jquery test ;)
[04:55:03] <ravenz> ok what is supposed to be "event" then?
[04:55:28] <Cork> ravenz: function foo(event) {}  .on('click', '.foo', foo)
[04:55:37] <Cork> this is still this
[04:55:39] <ravenz> oh
[04:55:40] <ravenz> lol
[04:55:45] <ravenz> that's nice
[04:56:36] <ravenz> I get an Cannot call method 'preventDefault' of undefined error
[04:57:16] <Cork> and your calling it like so ?> .on('click', '.foo', foo)
[04:57:21] <ravenz> ok I shouldn't use call
[04:57:35] <Cork> call would actually invoke the function so no
[04:57:47] <ravenz> yes
[04:57:50] <ravenz> silly me
[04:57:55] <Already> Is there any rule on what to implement server side and what to implement client side?
[04:58:04] <Cork> foo.call() is the same as foo() basically
[04:58:28] <Cork> Already: that question is a bit too generic
[04:58:42] <ravenz> Cork I meant bind()
[04:58:49] <Cork> ah
[04:59:02] <Cork> bind is not supported by all browsers though
[04:59:05] <ravenz> but it is fine anyway
[04:59:08] <ravenz> yes I know
[04:59:18] <ravenz> I could use the jQuery $.proxy
[04:59:23] <Cork> yes
[04:59:42] <ravenz> I wonder how better would be this approach
[04:59:49] <Cork> i find $.proxy kinda pointless my self though, but anyway...
[05:00:02] <Cork> ravenz: why not just pass the function?
[05:00:08] <ravenz> me either
[05:00:22] <Already> I thought so... ^^" Well I got a buch of data that should be displayed to the user and the user should get the option of filtering it and having some kind of load/save meachanism. I'm currently thinking about what to implement where and the order of things. Kinda hard. ^^"
[05:00:42] <ravenz> because I'll need to wrap this into the jquery obj
[05:00:42] <Cork> ah
[05:00:44] <ravenz> $(this)
[05:01:11] <Cork> Already: if your going to send all data to the user sorting it client side has a nice speed and rappid feel to it
[05:01:32] <Cork> Already: if you only send parts of the data (say ex. 100 row chunks) you can't sort it client side
[05:01:52] <termite> Already: is it a mobile or desktop app
[05:01:53] <Cork> Already: so the rule is rather simple, its do it client side if you can with good speed
[05:02:02] <Cork> otherwize do it server side
[05:02:47] <Already> I'm sending it all. Right now an implementation is in place which loads about 300 Items (300 parallel getJSON calls) but I think i'lll at least get that server side.
[05:02:51] <Cork> oh and things you don't want the user to see should be kepts server side
[05:03:30] <Already> Okay, thanks for those hints. I guess I'll just have to do some more planning first and then start implementing it. :)
[05:04:02] <termite> Already: you want to make as few calls as possible to the server because it won''t scale with large amounts of users 100 people would be 30,000 calls
[05:05:00] <termite> if the data is largely user agnostic then dump it into memcache
[05:05:06] <Already> I don't think that application will ever see such a high number of users but I guess it's one of those "don't assume this" scenarios. So you're probably right. *g*
[05:06:28] <termite> Already: How much data do you have?  Is it megs?
[05:08:53] <Already> No it's a few hunderd kb termite. Maybe at best a whole meg
[05:09:24] <Cork> Already: why do you to so many paralel calls?
[05:09:35] <Cork> sounds like you create a lot of overhead for no reason
[05:09:37] <termite> Already: does the data dffer from user
[05:10:34] <jomofcw> rgr I think $radioElements.val([13]); should "check" the radio having the value "13", nop ?
[05:10:49] <Already> Cork because I wanted to implement it in a different way and now, after some circumstances changed, i'm thinking about how to change it. :) Oh and I wanted to see how powerful getJSOn was. X)
[05:11:24] <Already> termite it's rather static that's why i guess it's best to directly embed it. Though I somehow still have to pass some of the information to jquery somehow.
[05:11:29] <Cork> Already: getJSON doens't mean you have to load each row separately...
[05:11:42] <Cork> just load an array with the rows you want
[05:12:50] <termite> Already: if it's static then throw it into memcache or up on your CDN.  You can also gzip it to compress the size and save some bandwidth.  I will get it all in one call
[05:13:08] <Already> But I wanted a nice progess counter! :( *laughs* Don't worry I know it was an aweful idea but I wanted to learn a few things about JSON and it was a good oppertunity to do so. :)
[05:13:16] <Already> Thanks termite und Cork. :)
[05:13:39] <Cork> Already: you can make xhr get a progress callback from the server as it sends the data
[05:13:45] <Cork> it needs a bit of implementation
[05:13:59] <Cork> but at least you don't have to open and close the connection 300 times
[05:14:38] <termite> yeah I can already hear your web server melting
[05:15:28] <seutje> you can hear it sizzle? :D
[05:15:46] <Already> It's a local webserver on this machine and I'm the only one using it, so it's not melting (yet) and to avoid having my "real" webserver melt I'm rewriting the whole thing. :)
[05:16:44] <Xtreme> guys is the syntax correct? $(".player").click(player($this.val()));
[05:16:57] <Xtreme> player is my function
[05:17:13] <Cork> no
[05:17:15] <Xtreme> and player is also a class for button
[05:17:23] <termite> Already: take a look at this book before you begin http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y
[05:17:28] <Cork> Xtreme: man i've answered that question already -_-'
[05:17:32] <Already> I think it should be $(".player").click(function(){player($this.val())});
[05:17:37] <termite> it will give you some really good ideas
[05:17:55] <Xtreme> ooh crap,, yes you right right... Already sorry for the trouble
[05:18:14] <Xtreme> Cork, sorry, i forgot.. return function
[05:18:41] <jomofcw> Why using $radioElements.val([13]); under IE doesnt select the radio[value=13] in the set of element, and after this each radio of the set of element return me 13 when I display $radioElement.val(); ? please :/...
[05:19:13] <Xtreme> Cork just wondering. why $(".down").click(downloadFront); works? downloadFront is a function. so we dont need this in funciton()?
[05:19:30] <Already> Because you're setting the Value of all those elements to 13 i guess
[05:20:43] <Already> Might be worth a read termite. It's always nice ot have someone recommend a book who has read it. :)
[05:21:05] <jomofcw> Already hello ^^ on each other browser it works as the doc said : checking the value giving in the array :/.
[05:21:23] <jomofcw> http://api.jquery.com/val/#val2
[05:21:25] <termite> Ohh I have read it trust me I think everyone should
[05:21:58] <Xtreme> anyone can shade some light please? why first one worked without()?
[05:22:01] <HughAJWood> What causes the 'Node' is undefined error in IE8 standards I am using $('#links').find('a').contents().filter(function)() { return this.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE...
[05:22:08] <termite> jomofcw: $("input[value=''13'"]) try that
[05:22:39] <Already> jomofcw as it states array of strings, did you try .val(["13"])?
[05:22:58] <Xtreme> i lost my irc logs.. i remember cork answered that too
[05:23:08] <ajpiano> HughAJWood: just use this.nodeType == 3
[05:23:29] <HughAJWood> okay thanks aj, didn't think about that
[05:27:18] <jomofcw> termite this on will give me the input having the value 13... that's not what I want :/...
[05:27:34] <jomofcw> Already true ! I try it.
[05:29:47] <seutje> jomofcw: what are you trying to do? something like http://jsfiddle.net/vHKGG/ ?
[05:30:40] <jomofcw> seutje hi ^^. I just want to apply a value to a radio :/. I mean, check a radio in a group (and ensure each other won't be checked too so).
[05:38:38] <Xtreme> guys, if a class is not there before i assign .click() for it, then it wont work when i add the class later on right?
[05:39:04] <seutje> jomofcw: oh, like http://jsfiddle.net/vHKGG/1/ ?
[05:39:15] <jomofcw> Xtreme you should use on() with a context
[05:39:37] <jomofcw> seutje I try it !
[05:41:22] <pakr_> hello, i have a script which changes the css of a div as it scrolls here http://pastebin.com/gxhtwEm9 how can i add the speed of animation to it or how fast or slow it moves?
[05:42:50] <termite> jomofcw:http://jsfiddle.net/ZjcQG/8/
[05:45:43] <Xtreme> jomofcw, yes its there. but the issue is, i am load my .player class later using ajax. but i call $(".player").click(blah blah f) first
[05:46:12] <Cork> ?.animate @ pakr_
[05:46:12] <bot-t> pakr_, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[05:47:04] <Cork> Xtreme: yes you need to use a delegated event listener
[05:47:28] <Xtreme> delegated?
[05:47:29] <Cork> Xtreme: delegated event listeners listen for bubbling events instead for local events
[05:47:34] <Cork> ?.delegate
[05:47:35] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:47:43] <Xtreme> cool
[05:47:46] <Cork> Xtreme: .on has that syntax too
[05:47:57] <Cork> its .on(event, selector, callback)
[05:48:09] <Xtreme> thanks :)
[05:48:10] <Cork> bind it on a parent that exists when your code runs
[05:48:18] <Cork> and listen for the class
[05:48:48] <Cork> so ex $('#parent').on('click', '.myclass', function() {});
[05:49:18] <termite> Xtreme: I highly recommend not using classes as selectors because of this problem can you use and #id
[05:49:33] <Cork> termite: uh...
[05:49:37] <Cork> why not use classes
[05:49:55] <Cork> your code has to be so freeking cumbersome if you only use id's
[05:50:28] <termite> because it become rather brittle all you need is your designer changing stuff and your code stops working
[05:50:29] <Cork> termite: and an id wouldn't help here
[05:50:31] <jomofcw> Xtreme as I said, don't use "on" with context. It seems you don't in your example.
[05:51:10] <Cork> jomofcw: sorry but... "on with context" i'm not sure what that means
[05:51:44] <Cork> termite: its a difference in thought
[05:52:00] <Cork> termite: i think that the markup of the html should driver the page, not the js
[05:52:18] <Cork> termite: the js should look at the html and do what it tells it to do
[05:52:28] <Cork> that way you can add content on the page and it works
[05:53:00] <Cork> instead of needing to go through js modification just to add just about anything
[05:53:28] <termite> Cork: great in theory but what do you do when you have a large team with tons of third party modules and such
[05:53:51] <Cork> termite: you make sure that each module is isolated before you add them to the page
[05:54:06] <Cork> its the check verify once use many
[05:54:20] <Cork> its a good way to make less work in the future
[05:54:55] <Cork> yes that means you can't just grab a random module and throw it on the page
[05:55:03] <Cork> but... you shouldn't do that in the first place anyway
[05:55:10] <jomofcw> Cork so I'm wrong on how to say it :/ : $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function(event){}) this example from doc
[05:55:33] <jomofcw> seutje it works, thanks ;)
[05:55:41] <Cork> jomofcw: thats a delegated selector or with a calling on with a selector
[05:55:47] <termite> It also mean you have to keep a close eye on third party module to make sure they don't break stuff.
[05:55:49] <Cork> context is something compleatly different
[05:56:08] <Cork> termite: uh.. each time you update the module sure
[05:56:31] <Cork> but same there i wouldn't ever run the module straight from there development trunk
[05:56:46] <Cork> i expect a stable api, with versoned updates
[05:57:00] <Cork> where i pick when to do the update
[05:57:10] <Cork> (or the one thats in charge of the module)
[05:57:12] <termite> I think having display dictate to code get really risky
[05:57:22] <termite> if you test allot I suppose it's safe
[05:57:24] <Xtreme> guys, $this.val() is not there? ;(
[05:57:38] <Cork> Xtreme: again whats $this?
[05:57:56] <Cork> i suspect its a name for $(this) but whats the source element?
[05:58:01] <termite> But I can't tell you how many times I have seen a class I need wiped out by some stupid js
[05:58:21] <Pietertje> whats a good webcam service to use with jquery
[05:58:23] <Cork> termite: if classes gives you problem the code is really badly written
[05:59:29] <Xtreme> Cork, suppose function test() is assigned to click event of button "me", and button me has value "1".. i want to pass 1 to test().. i need to use test($this.val()) right?
[05:59:38] <Xtreme> i am not sure,. but i read it somewhere'
[06:00:02] <Cork> Xtreme: and "button" is an input type="button" or a <button> ?
[06:00:37] <Cork> Xtreme: $this only exists if you create it
[06:00:46] <Xtreme> <button>. $(this) 	Selects the current HTML element..(tutorial)
[06:01:00] <Xtreme> is that right?
[06:01:00] <Cork> ok, button doesn't have a value attribute
[06:01:21] <Cork> input type="button" does though
[06:01:25] <Cork> you want .text()
[06:01:34] <Xtreme> Cork, yes it does.
[06:01:48] <Cork> Xtreme: so try test($(this).text())
[06:02:13] <Xtreme> <button value=blah1>blah</button>.. (that will give me blah, not blah1)
[06:02:18] <Cork> ok thats invalid
[06:02:33] <Cork> use <button data-value="bla">
[06:02:43] <Cork> and $(this).data('bla')
[06:03:06] <Cork> Xtreme: value only exists on form elements
[06:03:11] <Cork> (and not all of them)
[06:03:21] <Cork> uh
[06:03:27] <Cork> i meant $(this).data('value')
[06:05:19] <Grundell> Okay so i've got a theme for wordpress and i want to stop the slideshow on mouseover. Is there a simple script how to do this or does it take some reasearch to figure out how to stop on mouseover ?
[06:06:12] <Cork> Grundell: check the api for the slideshow plugin your using
[06:07:02] <Xtreme> Cork, www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/button :)
[06:07:24] <Xtreme> and yes. $(this).val() fixed my issue :)
[06:07:42] <Grundell> Cork it's a custom built theme and the slideshow is included in that one.
[06:08:12] <Grundell> Cork, i can paste the code for you for the slideshow... (Not the best at jQuery ...)
[06:08:27] <Cork> Grundell: the answer still stands, jquery doesn't have a slideshow
[06:08:50] <Cork> but sure i can have a look and see if theres anything to communicate with it
[06:09:29] <Cork> Xtreme: hmm thats new
[06:09:49] <Cork> Xtreme: might be they've changed that in the unification of html5
[06:09:55] <Grundell> Cork - they seam to be using jQuery nivo slider
[06:10:05] <Grundell> Ill bounce it over in 2 sec
[06:10:35] <Cork> Xtreme: but thats actually interesting i need to lab a bit and see what browsers do there, this might help me quite a bit actually
[06:10:56] <Grundell> http://pastebin.com/Kz6h6ZBg
[06:11:00] <Grundell> (cork)
[06:11:42] <Cork> ugg
[06:11:57] <Cork> why do slideshows always have to be so badly written T_T
[06:12:38] <Grundell> Cork - i have no idea to be honest...
[06:13:09] <Cork> this is, like about 90% of all slideshows i've ever seen doing broken assumptions
[06:13:31] <Cork> that a timer will always be exact in time down to the millisecond
[06:13:40] <Grundell> Cork - thats pretty bad..
[06:13:44] <Cork> that assumption is horribly wrong
[06:13:47] <Cork> it is
[06:14:29] <Cork> Grundell: it implements a "stop" command
[06:14:41] <Grundell> Cork - where ?
[06:15:04] <Cork> this.stop = function
[06:15:10] <Cork> the question is how to call it :P
[06:15:15] <Grundell> haha :P
[06:16:06] <Cork> Grundell: http://nivo.dev7studios.com/support/
[06:16:12] <Cork> "Can I start and stop the slider?"
[06:16:42] <Grundell> Cork - haha thanks :)(
[06:16:56] <Cork> np
[06:17:35] <Grundell> Cork - I assume that i can do that on an event then like mouseover / mouseout ?
[06:17:48] <Cork> stop start should work ya
[06:18:04] <Cork> but i would prob try using mouseenter/mouseleave instead of over/out
[06:18:57] <Grundell> Cork okay :)
[06:19:34] <Cork> fyi: see ?.mouseenter vs see ?.mousemove
[06:19:35] <bot-t> fyi, .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[06:19:35] <bot-t> fyi, .mousemove(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mousemove" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[06:22:01] <Grundell> Cork - so i assume that its better to work with mouse enter ?
[06:22:26] <Cork> mouseover mouseout
[06:22:34] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks for the vocabulary :D !
[06:22:35] <Cork> will trigger when you move from parent to child elements
[06:22:35] <Grundell> okay
[06:23:01] <Cork> Grundell: mouseenter/mouseleave only triggers when you leav the parent-child tree
[06:23:11] <Grundell> ahh okay
[06:23:51] <Cork> well enter/leave the parent-child tree
[06:24:57] <sh0ne> is there any way to make jQuery UI datepicker hidden initially if it is attached to a span field (not input) ?
[06:27:20] <Grundell> Cork - Sorry for stupid question now, but there has to be some, how do i acutally write the stop / start on mouseover/out and where do i put it :P
[06:28:01] <Cork> Grundell: look into the dom tree, pick the outer most element that you want the area it covers to stop the slide
[06:28:46] <Grundell> whcih is #slide
[06:28:53] <luzon19> Hello everyone
[06:28:54] <Phpdevluhv> can anyone tell me if this would be a correct way to select the id of thisElement in a div called "thisDiv" $("#thisDiv #thisElement") ?
[06:29:05] <luzon19> I am having a weird problem with setInterval
[06:29:24] <luzon19> I have setup the testcase here http://cssdeck.com/labs/collab/48wlk9ke/0
[06:29:29] <Cork> Grundell: then add a .on('mouseenter', function() {}).on('mouseleave', function() {}); and attache it to that one
[06:29:41] <Cork> Grundell: in the two callbacks start and stop the slideshow
[06:29:42] <luzon19> the animation is not wrking
[06:30:09] <Cork> Phpdevluhv: no need for the dubble id's
[06:30:15] <Cork> Phpdevluhv: an id can only exist once in the dom
[06:30:24] <Cork> so $('#thisElement') is all you need
[06:30:35] <Grundell> So simply put in the $('#slider').data('nivoslider').stop(); / in to function and then put it where in the code ?
[06:31:29] <Cork> Grundell: this is a bit of a guess but something like $('#slider').on('mouseenter', function() { $(this).data('nivoslider').stop(); }).on('mouseleave', function() { $(this).data('nivoslider').start(); });
[06:32:07] <Cork> it needs to be run when the #slider element exist in the dom, that all
[06:32:34] <Phpdevluhv> in my case I am embedding a widget on a page.  my element name can be whatever, I just am thinking that in a rare case I could be using the same #thisElement id as the original page does.  I just wanted to explicitly say that I only want to modify #thisElement within a specific div.  I know it's not idea1, but will #thisDiv #thisElement work?   and if not, have any suggestions?
[06:32:44] <Grundell> Cork - okay, and then i should put it on what line ?
[06:32:54] <Cork> it needs to be run when the #slider element exist in the dom, that all <--
[06:33:14] <Grundell> Cork - sorry for being a total newbie :P
[06:33:17] <Grundell> Cork okaty
[06:33:41] <Cork> Phpdevluhv: if another element uses that id, you will have problem selecting it, or that page will have problem selecting it
[06:33:52] <Cork> Phpdevluhv: cause you can only ever select the first instance
[06:34:07] <Cork> Phpdevluhv: better make your id long to make it uniq enough to never conflict
[06:34:20] <Phpdevluhv> so then is there no way to only place the scope of a selector within a specific div?
[06:34:38] <Cork> sure, but you the id will cause problems anyway
[06:34:42] <Phpdevluhv> cause I can make a #fafeafegiiihpoirandom div, I was just wondering if there was an alternative.. u know just in case
[06:34:46] <Cork> cause there is only one allowed instance of an id
[06:34:58] <Phpdevluhv> ah, okay
[06:35:11] <Phpdevluhv> thanks for the help
[06:35:53] <Cork> Phpdevluhv: http://jsfiddle.net/FWqQh/
[06:36:06] <Cork> that should tell you why there will always be a problem
[06:36:45] <Cork> the second selector will work, but your not using id's anymore, your using the id attribute on any element, so no speed table lookup
[06:40:59] <Phpdevluhv> Cork: Great!  I understand now.  Thanks so much
[06:41:52] <luzon19> Ok, I tried everything but ut's still not working
[06:41:54] <luzon19> it*
[06:42:47] <luzon19> the console is showing what I need but I don't see the animation in the output when using setTimeout
[06:43:05] <luzon19> the testcase is here http://cssdeck.com/labs/collab/48wlk9ke/0
[06:45:03] <black_warlock> hello
[06:46:06] <black_warlock> guys how do i send a form in a div ?
[06:46:51] <luzon19> Ok, found the solution
[06:46:59] <luzon19> prefixfree was messing it up
[06:47:02] <termite> black_warlock: what do you mean by "send"
[06:47:10] <black_warlock> method post
[06:47:11] <luzon19> I removed it and the animation worked :)
[06:48:01] <luzon19> katahdin: I fixed it :)
[06:48:53] <termite> good
[06:51:04] <termite> black_warlock: so  you have form elements but they are not inside a form tag?
[06:51:19] <black_warlock> they are in a form
[06:51:27] <black_warlock> i called a form in a div
[06:52:15] <black_warlock> with $("#pip").load("page.php?id=1"+ " #main")
[06:52:58] <black_warlock> now i got the entire form inside a div but if i press "send" it will open the ACTION of form outside div
[06:53:05] <termite> $("#pip > form")[0].submit()
[06:53:29] <black_warlock> the form method is post
[06:53:54] <sh0ne> is there any way to make jQuery UI datepicker hidden initially if it is attached to a span field (not input) ?
[06:54:28] <termite> do you have a fiddle or some example code?
[06:55:01] <arielserafini> termite, $("#pip > form").first().submit() if you want to do it with jQuery
[06:55:24] <arielserafini> ?demo @ sh0ne
[06:55:24] <bot-t> sh0ne, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:56:08] <termite> black_warlock: you don't have a form nested inside a form do you?
[06:56:17] <black_warlock> nope
[06:56:22] <black_warlock> its a simple form
[06:56:34] <black_warlock> i would to send via div
[06:56:42] <black_warlock> and gets the results inside the div
[06:57:07] <black_warlock> termite its a simple form
[06:57:11] <black_warlock> normal form
[06:57:43] <black_warlock> instead to send it with page reload i wish to load it inside a div
[06:57:50] <black_warlock> wait i make fiddle
[07:00:02] <termite> black_warlock: f you want to use post instead of get with a .load then the data you pass needs to be in a JS object and not in the url
[07:01:06] <black_warlock> you afvice to use get method ?
[07:01:10] <black_warlock> advice*
[07:02:42] <granden> How do I bind an listener to a <form> dropdown? I want to update an amount variable everytime an dropdown in teh form is changed.
[07:02:53] <termite> it's up to you get seem simpler from what you are telling me
[07:04:11] <termite> granden: $("#dropdownID").change(function(){{});
[07:04:14] <johnkpaul> ?change @ granden
[07:04:14] <bot-t> granden, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:04:38] <granden> termite: Ok, thanks!
[07:11:22] <IGna_> hi.. im using ajax to bring up some content from a different page.. for some reason when i try to submit the data is not being sent.. it works fine in the original page
[07:11:54] <black_warlock> termite but get method its not secure
[07:12:17] <black_warlock> and its limitating
[07:14:56] <termite> black_warlock: It depends on what you want to use it for.  If don't want the values in the url then use post
[07:15:33] <termite> black_warlock:  just grab the values in the form stick them into an js object and then send the object using .load
[07:18:44] <black_warlock> load wont work
[07:18:55] <black_warlock> load works only with get method
[07:21:13] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/wXqjC/7/
[07:21:16] <black_warlock> this is the form
[07:21:27] <black_warlock> sent normally with method post
[07:24:09] <anli_> Why is slider.slider('value') not giving me the same value as ui.value in the slide handler?
[07:25:31] <black_warlock> its not .val()
[07:26:46] <termite> black_warlock: check the fiddle again
[07:26:56] <termite> http://jsfiddle.net/wXqjC/12/
[07:29:34] <black_warlock> you have serialized data values
[07:40:15] <callumacrae> hm
[07:40:21] <callumacrae> trying to fork jQuery
[07:40:27] <callumacrae> GitHub is taking forever :-/
[07:41:04] <black_warlock> this one its what im looking for http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#ajaxForm

[08:07:26] <s34n> given an xml document X, if I want to "pop" $(X).children(":last") from X, do I have to clone() then remove() it?
[08:12:08] <Nomikos> docmur_: you have alert("DATA IS: ", data ); , that comma should be a '+'
[08:13:18] <basso_> Hi, I'm using animate({scrollTop:2870 },"200"); in top navigation links; this works fine. But then I wanted to animate normal links on the page as well. This works, but the effect first jumps to the top of the page, then to the designated distance. I want it to scroll to the new position from the current link position. Anyone knows how to achieve this?
[08:13:22] <stewbydoo> is there no way besides a jquery plugin to customize scroll bars?
[08:13:41] <basso_> stewbydoo: yes, regular CSS
[08:13:43] <callumacrae> Pure JS!
[08:13:50] <callumacrae> oh, it can be done using CSS these days?
[08:14:00] <stewbydoo> yea I thought it couldn't
[08:14:08] <basso_> since long time
[08:14:21] <stewbydoo> are you sure because I'm almost positive they took it out
[08:14:29] <stewbydoo> google me wrong
[08:14:54] <basso_> It's CSS1 standard even
[08:14:54] <callumacrae> ::-webkit-scrollbar
[08:14:57] <basso_> you google it ;)
[08:14:58] <callumacrae> but that's non-standard
[08:15:02] <Nomikos> javascript still needs to apply colors & styles to something, those will be css attributes
[08:15:05] <stewbydoo> yes webkit
[08:15:06] <callumacrae> basso_: No, IE used to support it
[08:15:07] <stewbydoo> only webkit
[08:15:09] <callumacrae> But that was non-standard
[08:15:18] <stewbydoo> yea used to. in IE 5.5
[08:15:26] <Nomikos> basso_: does this help? http://jtauber.com/blog/2008/04/28/auto-scrolling_is_jquery/
[08:15:59] <callumacrae> Nomikos: The old approach was to create a div, hide the scrollbar, and move the div using jquery
[08:16:17] <stewbydoo> move the div...thinking outside the box
[08:16:19] <Nomikos> callumacrae: ah hrmph, that's cheating :-)
[08:16:49] <callumacrae> Yeah, it looks like that is what most of the plugins do, too
[08:16:55] <callumacrae> Well, it still isn't that easy
[08:17:11] <callumacrae> You gotta move the page when the scrollbar is moved, too
[08:19:56] <basso_> Nomikos: let me see...
[08:20:04] <s34n> is there some shortcut to var Y = $(X).children(":last").clone(); $(X).children(":last").remove();    ?
[08:20:44] <Nomikos> s34n: you could try moving the items somehow, with prepend or .. something that moves items
[08:20:55] <ajpiano> var el = $(x).children().last(), y = el.clone(); el.remove();
[08:21:07] <ajpiano> requerying the entire dom to do it is a waste
[08:21:11] <ajpiano> just save the reference before you clone
[08:21:16] <Nomikos> s34n: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279957/how-to-move-an-element-into-another-element
[08:21:55] <basso_> Nomikos: yes, i think this might be the thing i was looking for, thank you :)
[08:23:46] <s34n> Nomikos: thx. in my case, X is an xmlhttprequest xml doc, and I'm trying to "pop" part of it into a new xml doc. So I don't think appendTo will do the trick.
[08:28:33] <reloadz> hello! I need to make option that can open and hide specific div content
[08:28:34] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/GzKyp/
[08:28:58] <reloadz> when you press on KNAME then SKATS need too fade
[08:29:09] <reloadz> SLIDE*
[08:31:03] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/GzKyp/1/
[08:32:36] <Nomikos> Is there a way I can get it to give me the "real" width of #gallery, without adding up all the image widths? http://jsfiddle.net/Lwktc/
[08:33:01] <reloadz> <Nomikos> thx! now i need to read about it :)
[08:33:12] <Nomikos> reloadz: have fun :)
[08:33:44] <basso_> Nomikos: no, it wasn't what i was looking for :( That function looks up how far a certain element is, then scrolls to that distance. I know the distance I want to scroll to, the problem is, is that it first "jumps" to the top, then to the distance I specified. I must not jump to the top first, but simply scroll to the specified height.
[08:34:06] <Nomikos> basso_: is it .. that there's a href="#" in the <a> tag?
[08:34:16] <basso_> yes
[08:34:19] <basso_> why?
[08:34:25] <Nomikos> that's causing it then
[08:34:49] <basso_> what should I specify then? Since the link must not point to anythingI tried "" but then it does not work
[08:35:02] <Nomikos> try taking it out, or apply the "prevent default" thing (which I can never remember how to spell or its sideeffects..)
[08:35:07] <basso_> I always used # for links not pointing anywhere...
[08:35:28] <Nomikos> basso_: yeah, the # makes the browser look for an anchor with that name, and defaults to top-of-page
[08:35:37] <basso_> Let me try again, but i believe it does not work then
[08:35:55] <Nomikos> basso_: <a class="foo"> will still be clickable, just maybe not show the pointer cursor. you can set that with css though
[08:36:12] <basso_> yeah
[08:37:38] <basso_> Nomikos: no, if I leave the # out, the function does not work anymore
[08:37:54] <basso_> It jumps to the top of the page, without animation
[08:38:16] <Nomikos> basso_: how odd. do you have this online/live somewhere, or can you make a jsfiddle?
[08:39:11] <basso_> http://koekeneicatering.basbeenhakker.com
[08:39:28] <basso_> search for "Wij denken graag met u mee"
[08:39:37] <basso_> thats an example link
[08:40:13] <basso_> top navigation links work fine, since, like you said, default to the top of the page, but now for the links in the text
[08:40:54] <Nomikos> hm, it seems to work fine in my firefox
[08:41:26] <Nomikos> but I see what you mean in Chrome
[08:41:55] <basso_> it works, but there is a millisecond that it first jumps to the top of the page, then to the specified height, instead of simply scrolling from THAT position to the specified height
[08:42:09] <basso_> you see what i mean?
[08:42:52] <Nomikos> basso_: yes. when I use the inspector to remove the href='#' it works in Chrome too, without skipping to the top
[08:43:21] <basso_> windows or mac you're using?
[08:43:30] <Nomikos> for clarity, remove both the attribute (href) and value (#)
[08:43:32] <Nomikos> mac
[08:43:53] <basso_> ok, in only removed the #, let me remove the href complety
[08:44:27] <basso_> Aaa yes :))))
[08:44:33] <basso_> Great, thanks a lot
[08:44:42] <Nomikos> graag gedaan ;-)
[08:45:00] <basso_> Hehe ;)
[08:45:21] <Nomikos> basso_: use css to set cursor: pointer; for those tags, so people still see a pointy thing on mouseover
[08:45:42] <basso_> yeah, Im already using that one, but thanks a bunch anyway
[08:46:04] <Nomikos> purrfect
[08:47:49] <jds_> Heya
[08:50:01] <jds_> I'm loading jQuery via yepnope.  I'm finding that if I do so, and DOMContentLoaded fires before jquery.js is loaded, then $(document).ready doesn't actually fire until window.onload
[08:59:28] <danzik17> jds_: yea.  if it misses DOMContentLoaded, then it'll wait for onload.  if onload has already happened, then document.readyState === "complete" and it'll still work.

Does the create_scaled_image function process the thumbnails as well as the fullsized images? or should i be asking this in #php?
[09:19:04] <Stratus3D> @str8uplinux it depends on where you are resizing your images. If it is server side you should try #php
[09:19:05] <b-ot> Stratus3D, no YOU ARE resizing your images. If it is server side you should try #php
[09:19:17] <NoiseEee> lol

[09:29:36] <guy> "$(window).on('mousemove', [..])"
[09:29:39] <guy> why this doesn't work in IE?
[09:29:50] <guy> IE7 and down.
[09:30:16] <ravenzz> are you sure that you want to do that?
[09:30:29] <guy> unfortunately.
[09:31:06] <guy> unless you know a more clever way to create a custom scrollbar than mousedown + track mouse movement + mouseup + stop tracking
[09:31:26] <danzik17> Nivery: you're calling jQuery.noConflict() in your script.js.  after that, $ is no longer jQuery.
[09:32:00] <Nivery> blech, i see
[09:32:05] <Nivery> how did you figure that out danzik :)
[09:32:27] <ravenzz> guys there are plugins for that
[09:32:52] <danzik17> Nivery: because window.jQuery was jQuery, window.$ was not.  i knew you were calling it somewhere, a simple Ctrl+F found it.
[09:33:09] <guy> ravenzz: so.. any reason for that not to work?
[09:33:48] <Nivery> danzik17, thanks!
[09:34:42] <guy> Seems like IE doesn't like wondow/s (lol)
[09:34:51] <guy> "windows"
[09:39:22] <ravenzz> I think because the window object is not a dom element
[09:39:42] <ravenzz> so it doesn't have the mousemove event
[09:40:40] <ravenzz> guy http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/mousemove.html

[09:53:54] <bot-t> pachet: "[\"yes\",\"you\",\"can!\"]"
[09:54:30] <ravenzz> odd
[09:54:30] <pachet> otherwise you can just serialize it and it'll get passed in standard querystring format

[09:59:47] <callumacrae> <div style="background-color: #000; color: #fff">
[09:59:49] <callumacrae> Works fine
[10:02:23] <peterschmidler> callumacrae: I've got an element like this on a page and I want to get the value of background-color via jquery.
[10:03:06] <callumacrae> $(element).css('background-color')

[10:16:31] <enhance> morning
[10:16:36] <blindMoe> mornin
[10:16:52] <enhance> been looking for a code snippet or use case for an interesting UI effect
[10:16:53] <blindMoe> enhance: you must be on my coast... isn't morning for most people
[10:17:00] <enhance> blindMoe: correct
[10:17:18] <enhance> it's also 58 and cloudy outside
[10:17:28] <blindMoe> what is your interesting UI effect?  And can I steal it for my site?
[10:17:33] <enhance> haha.
[10:17:34] <blindMoe> aww you must be in the bay area
[10:17:40] <raj> i'm stuck with my css not working
[10:17:41] <raj> so annoying
[10:17:45] <enhance> imagine you have 4 blocks
[10:17:49] <blindMoe> tis 76 and sunny here
[10:17:51] <raj> can't continue work until it's at least somewhat working
[10:17:53] <enhance> vertically stacked
[10:17:59] <blindMoe> raj: create a jsfiddle of what you are trying to do
[10:18:01] <enhance> click on any of the blocks, it slides to the top
[10:18:09] <raj> I'm trying to make jsfiddle.net/thapar/JR6nQ/ look like http://i.imgur.com/d3Y3y.png
[10:18:16] <enhance> trying to achieve this effect without it being really jarring
[10:18:21] <raj> #css has tumbleweed
[10:18:27] <enhance> haha
[10:18:36] <blindMoe> enhance: do all the other blocks smoothly shift down as the new block moves into place?
[10:18:42] <enhance> yes
[10:18:51] <enhance> lots of z-index hackery
[10:19:08] <blindMoe> shouldn't be lots
[10:19:11] <enhance> i don't mind writing it myself
[10:19:19] <enhance> but seeing if someone has a good example
[10:19:35] <blindMoe> hrmm I don't off hand
[10:19:42] <raj> any ideas blindMoe?
[10:19:55] <enhance> raj: the vertical part is the problem :)
[10:20:09] <raj> vertical and horizontal
[10:20:10] <enhance> raj: and not really technically feasible without js
[10:20:15] <blindMoe> raj: looks like you need a min-height on #content
[10:20:16] <raj> really?
[10:20:27] <enhance> blindMoe: he wants to fill the browser portal vertically
[10:20:40] <blindMoe> yeah your two columns will not be the same height all the time w/o js or some css trickery
[10:20:47] <raj> i just need everything to stretch with browser window
[10:20:52] <enhance> yeah
[10:21:01] <raj> cra[
[10:21:03] <raj> crap
[10:21:08] <raj> that's sloppy
[10:21:12] <enhance> go look up .height()
[10:21:19] <raj> i'm familiar with height
[10:21:23] <enhance> well
[10:21:26] <enhance> in css3
[10:21:28] <enhance> there is no way to do this
[10:21:29] <raj> was hoping there was a pure css way to do this
[10:21:29] <enhance> :)
[10:21:32] <enhance> nope
[10:21:42] <resharpersuxass> why do u want to do it in css?
[10:21:48] <blindMoe> raj: it is sloppy but it actually works pretty well considering .height() works in every browser you need it to
[10:21:56] <MistuhKurtz> raj what about faux columns?
[10:22:01] <raj> yeah, but it'll have lag
[10:22:07] <raj> MistuhKurtz, what's that?
[10:22:10] <MistuhKurtz> google it
[10:22:12] <resharpersuxass> raj
[10:22:16] <MistuhKurtz> there's an article on alistapart about it
[10:22:17] <resharpersuxass> why do u want to do it in css for
[10:22:19] <pringlescan> can anyone take a look at a 1:54 demo video i made of something in javascript and tell me what they think of using it to open a presentation? http://www.youtube.com/embed/u3KwhxPyC1E?autohide=1&autoplay=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&wmode=opaque
[10:22:25] <enhance> faux columns really work for some cases
[10:22:33] <enhance> not some others
[10:22:55] <resharpersuxass> raj:  why do u want to do it in css for?
[10:23:21] <raj> MistuhKurtz, I know scrollbars and stuff though for each of the two columns
[10:23:27] <raj> resharpersuxass, it's smoother
[10:23:33] <enhance> no, not really
[10:23:38] <raj> js has lag
[10:23:40] <raj> and breaks
[10:23:41] <MistuhKurtz> ah sorry, i wasn't entirely sure of your case
[10:23:49] <raj> np, thanks for the suggestion
[10:23:51] <blindMoe> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/JR6nQ/7/  ( this requires you to have a static height set on #content though
[10:24:03] <resharpersuxass> so can u do it iin css?
[10:24:04] <raj> blindMoe, yeah, that doesn't work either =T
[10:24:13] <raj> guess I have no choice but js then
[10:24:20] <blindMoe> raj: also your divs were not floating correctly because you cannot have the width's add up to 100% and have borders
[10:24:32] <enhance> box-sizing!
[10:24:36] <blindMoe> raj: with what I pasted you can just reset the height of the #content div
[10:24:47] <resharpersuxass> raj:  is doing it in js gonna make it lag and break
[10:24:48] <resharpersuxass> ?
[10:25:00] <raj> i expect so
[10:25:31] <blindMoe> raj: to combat the "js lag", which you probably won't even expericen, have a loading graphic show up, then fix your divs, then begin the actual chat connection
[10:25:42] <blindMoe> once the chat connection is established take off the loading graphic
[10:25:53] <resharpersuxass> how is css faster than js?
[10:25:57] <blindMoe> I wrote an ajax chat client a while back and that is how I handled it
[10:26:12] <blindMoe> resharpersuxass: because the CSS is applied and then $(document).ready() is called
[10:26:32] <pringlescan> resharpersuxass, because if javascript manipulates the DOM it will result in redraws, it's better to include the CSS initially
[10:26:35] <blindMoe> in most cases it is like a 1 millisecond difference though
[10:26:36] <enhance> because with js, you have to wait until the window is finished resizing so window.scrollTop can call to height()
[10:26:52] <resharpersuxass> oh
[10:26:53] <enhance> window.scrollTop doesn't change as you move the handles
[10:26:59] <resharpersuxass> so css does it in real time?
[10:27:04] <enhance> effectively.
[10:27:16] <resharpersuxass> is there someting faster than css?
[10:27:21] <MistuhKurtz> it's just a matter of what is applied first resharpersuxass
[10:27:33] <blindMoe> resharpersuxass: not really
[10:27:46] <resharpersuxass> so css is the fastest?
[10:28:10] <MistuhKurtz> the fastest what? There's nothing that 'competes' with CSS
[10:28:28] <resharpersuxass> fastest in terms of speed
[10:28:38] <resharpersuxass> i mean i heard html was faster than css
[10:28:42] <resharpersuxass> but mayb its not true
[10:31:02] <resharpersuxass> do you  know?
[10:31:05] <resharpersuxass> raj:
[10:31:41] <shoky> raj wadup
[10:33:41] <arielserafini> resharpersuxass, xhtml is faster than html
[10:33:51] <arielserafini> and html5 is faster than xhtml
[10:33:54] <arielserafini> :)
[10:34:01] <resharpersuxass> are u serious?
[10:34:08] <arielserafini> of course not
[10:34:09] <resharpersuxass> is canvas faster than css?
[10:34:10] <arielserafini> were you?
[10:34:15] <resharpersuxass> ya
[10:34:21] <blindMoe> hehe
[10:34:24] <resharpersuxass> i wanted to know whats the fastest render
[10:34:31] <resharpersuxass> i heard js was slower than css
[10:34:32] <docmur> I'm having a really strange issue whre my $.post will enter the correct the php file and the php will echo back the correct result but then the $.post just seems to ignore the echo back, this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/XsP6J/1/  I put the php in the HTML box, can alone see the issue, if you run this code in a php debugger you will hit the line echo true, which should trigger a page forward
[10:34:37] <arielserafini> html is a markup language, it doesn't render anything
[10:34:39] <resharpersuxass> but i heard html is faster than html
[10:34:54] <resharpersuxass> and i hard canvas was faster than css too
[10:35:06] <resharpersuxass> well i mean css is markup too
[10:35:08] <resharpersuxass> and so is js
[10:35:12] <resharpersuxass> and canvas
[10:35:12] <arielserafini> resharpersuxass, where are you hearing these things?
[10:35:16] <resharpersuxass> so what do u mean
[10:35:26] <resharpersuxass> from apple
[10:35:34] <resharpersuxass> except google said js is faster
[10:35:35] <arielserafini> sounds like obsessive premature optimization to me
[10:36:15] <resharpersuxass> well i dont think so
[10:36:19] <arielserafini> it's all a little too abstract to be discussed like that
[10:36:21] <resharpersuxass> for example
[10:36:27] <arielserafini> depends on what you're trying to do
[10:36:28] <resharpersuxass> raj wanted to do css cause its faster
[10:36:28] <EyePulp> is there a way to set an element's html() via the .attr() function?  I want to a pass a map of html & title to attr(), but it seems to ignore html or text values
[10:36:32] <resharpersuxass> and its noticable
[10:36:38] <resharpersuxass> the difference
[10:36:44] <resharpersuxass> is that premature ?
[10:37:03] <arielserafini> if you're trying to find "the fastest thing" yes, it's premature
[10:37:17] <arielserafini> because it will depend on the context of what you're trying to do
[10:38:20] <resharpersuxass> well how bout a chat program
[10:38:29] <resharpersuxass> would u make it in html?
[10:38:32] <resharpersuxass> prolly not
[10:38:35] <sisb> IMO premature optimization varies from person to person.  I like to think of it as a calculation:  if (time_spent_creating <= time_spent_optimizing) premature = true;
[10:38:36] <resharpersuxass> cause of the refreshes
[10:38:40] <houman> How do I set the value for a <a> element with jquery?
[10:38:42] <houman> var a=document.createElement('a');
[10:38:44] <houman>     a.setAttribute('data-toggle', 'tab');
[10:38:46] <houman>     a.setAttribute('href', '#tab' + total);
[10:38:51] <houman> sorry in this case javascript..
[10:38:51] <resharpersuxass> if u made it in javascript
[10:38:54] <resharpersuxass> its faster
[10:38:58] <resharpersuxass> casue no refresh
[10:38:59] <resharpersuxass> but
[10:39:08] <resharpersuxass> when u resize the screen its slow
[10:39:13] <resharpersuxass> if u made it in css
[10:39:20] <resharpersuxass> u can resize it and its faster than js
[10:39:27] <resharpersuxass> but if u made it in canvas its fastest
[10:39:37] <resharpersuxass> cause it renders with native code
[10:39:46] <resharpersuxass> see my point?
[10:40:07] <pringlescan> have you ever been with native code? she does things that css doesn't do.
[10:40:36] <resharpersuxass> like what
[10:41:18] <pringlescan> she can handle more frames at once
[10:41:40] <resharpersuxass> how many
[10:41:52] <pringlescan> 2 frames with one frame buffer
[10:42:10] <resharpersuxass> can she do prebuffer?
[10:42:25] <pringlescan> Only if you give her the right parameters
[10:42:36] <resharpersuxass> and parrallax
[10:42:49] <pringlescan> nah, she doesn't like that so much
[10:43:19] <resharpersuxass> what if i cached her first
[10:43:48] <pringlescan> she's not a one cache kinda technology, that's not going to change her free spirit
[10:44:46] <resharpersuxass> what if i give her a bigger cache
[10:45:17] <resharpersuxass> more cache
[10:46:03] <shoky> raj: is this good? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JR6nQ/50/
[10:50:45] <shoky> even better- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JR6nQ/64/
[10:58:27] <docmur> I'm having a really strange issue whre my $.post will enter the correct the php file and the php will echo back the correct result but then the $.post just seems to ignore the echo back, this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/XsP6J/1/  I put the php in the HTML box, can alone see the issue, if you run this code in a php debugger you will hit the line echo true, which should trigger a page forward
[11:00:19] <arielserafini> docmur, jsfiddle won't work with php
[11:00:44] <Jon47> docmur what is the http status code of the response?  I think in that shorthand the function provided will only get called on a successful response
[11:00:46] <docmur> I know but without the php it's fairly useless asking for help, so I just threw it in there so at least someone can see what Im talking about

[11:10:41] <blk_panther> js/jquery capable of splitting 2 img in the middle (topleft-bottomright) so that you have 4 triangles - and join them together in a half/half img?
[11:11:27] <arielserafini> blk_panther, you should be able to do that with canvas
[11:11:35] <arielserafini> not a jquery thing though
[11:11:45] <clooth> Why am I unable to get a value of an input? http://d.pr/i/VCDl
[11:11:46] <clooth> <_<
[11:13:56] <blk_panther> no idea clooth - tried without _ in id-name?
[11:15:32] <AdamPDotty> display:none; does strange things
[11:16:38] <blk_panther> ah - good catch adam
[11:18:56] <blk_panther> bump: any news on the triangle-img front?
[11:19:29] <arielserafini> blk_panther, are you reading me?
[11:20:17] <blk_panther> ah - overlooked that - guess I'll google that before continue asking questions - ty
[11:20:33] <arielserafini> ah
[11:20:45] <arielserafini> i'm having DNS issues so I thought maybe my messages weren't getting through
[11:22:03] <EyePulp> Hello operator? I was just making sure the phone worked, because this boy was supposed to call, but he didn't, and it *must* be due to  the phone...
[11:22:37] <EyePulp> =)
[11:22:42] <arielserafini> EyePulp, exactly
[11:22:56] <arielserafini> :/
[11:23:23] * EyePulp doesn't miss landlines
[11:23:40] * arielserafini echoes that sentiment
[11:25:08] <blk_panther> I think js way would be faster developing for me - any other ideas?
[11:26:04] <arielserafini> blk_panther, what do you mean?
[11:26:19] <arielserafini> you can manipulate a canvas using javascript
[11:26:28] <arielserafini> and add images to it, draw on it, whatever you want
[11:26:42] <arielserafini> including cutting these images to polygons
[11:26:58] <arielserafini> which sounds like what you want
[11:27:28] <arielserafini> there are a lot of libraries for working with canvas
[11:27:33] <blk_panther> I have no idea what canvas is, how to use it etc.
[11:27:41] <arielserafini> ah
[11:27:54] <resharpersuxass> i have a landline
[11:28:08] <arielserafini> I can't access the web right now, otherwise I'd look for some guides
[11:28:48] <blk_panther> so while I read on canvas, I was looking for other possible solutions; I'll get canvas on my own eventually
[11:29:07] <blk_panther> but if I see a shorter solution, I'll take it
[11:29:07] <arielserafini> blk_panther, I can't think of any other way :/
[11:29:09] <resharpersuxass> what do u mean blk panker
[11:29:24] <ElderFain> I have a selector like $('select[name*="-userChoice"]').change(function() { do something;}); and it works great when only one thing matches
[11:29:33] <ElderFain> but when i have multiple selects that match, it doesn't fire at all.
[11:29:44] <arielserafini> ?demo @ ElderFain
[11:29:45] <bot-t> ElderFain, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:30:10] <blk_panther> I want 2 images, split in half (4 triangles) and join 2 of them together to get a new img (half/half), resharpersuxass
[11:30:41] <resharpersuxass> and u want to use canvas to do that?
[11:31:00] <blk_panther> ElderFain: try .each()
[11:31:18] <ElderFain> so i have to add .change to .each?
[11:31:26] <ElderFain> meh, was hoping it would be smart enough to realize that its an array..
[11:31:39] <blk_panther> I guess it should
[11:33:07] <arielserafini> ElderFain, change should work like that
[11:34:27] <ElderFain> k im working on a demo never used jsfiddle =0
[11:35:22] <NoiseEee> any way to find out which of 'jquery' or 'prototype.js' is loaded?
[11:35:35] <arielserafini> NoiseEee, which version?
[11:36:14] <NoiseEee> i need to write some JS that needs to work with both libs;  the JS needs to know which lib its working with.
[11:37:53] <arielserafini> NoiseEee, can't you test for jQuery?
[11:37:59] <arielserafini> window.jQuery
[11:38:22] <w00tner> helppppppp
[11:39:05] <w00tner> can anyone tell me what's wrong with my device.ready function? http://fiddle.jshell.net/aRZ3F/   it stops working when i add the last part   $("#formReg").submit(function(e) {

[11:39:28] <w00tner> im getting in console: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input

[11:40:55] <Melsom> Hi! Wondering if I could get some help with jquery. :)
[11:41:26] <arielserafini> Melsom, just ask your question, someone will help you if they can
[11:41:55] <Melsom> I have this code, http://pastebin.com/WiQjydfx. ".viewInfo" should be shown by the click of a ".gridItem".
[11:42:00] <Melsom> within the same parent.
[11:42:15] <arielserafini> I can't load any web pages right now, so I can't help :/
[11:42:16] <Melsom> And perhaps, if the same is clicked again, it should be hidden.
[11:42:24] <Melsom> oh :/
[11:42:25] <k1ng_> i am using jquery 1.7.1 but i am having issue with .on()
[11:42:27] <arielserafini> I'd also reccomend you make a jsfiddle instead of a pastebin
[11:42:44] <arielserafini> recommend?
[11:42:45] <k1ng_> jQuery('#zoom').on(), [object Object] has no method 'on'
[11:42:45] <arielserafini> whatever
[11:43:28] <Melsom> Haha, recommend i guess, yes. :p
[11:43:35] <k1ng_> anyone?
[11:43:40] <arielserafini> k1ng_, are you sure it's 1.7.1?
[11:43:45] <Eviltwin> k1ng_: Whay does jQuery.fn.jquery say?
[11:43:46] <k1ng_> yes i am sure
[11:43:55] <arielserafini> Eviltwin, <3
[11:43:57] <k1ng_> goddamn it
[11:44:03] <k1ng_> something else is loading 1.6.4
[11:44:08] <k1ng_> Eviltwin, thank you
[11:44:09] <Eviltwin> Knew it
[11:44:14] <arielserafini> me too :P
[11:46:58] <blk_panther> arialserafini: perhaps I'll check back with your tutorials tomorrow?
[11:47:10] <blk_panther> guess it's going to be a long night for me, ...
[11:47:29] <arielserafini> blk_panther, I'm no canvas wizard, but I guess you could google for it?
[11:47:39] <w00tner> im not eating until solving this
[11:47:45] <arielserafini> if you're familiar with flash, there's CreateJS
[11:47:47] <w00tner> thats motivation
[11:47:58] <arielserafini> which mimmicks the flash API
[11:48:15] <blk_panther> I'm on it (okay, I checked out jsLint, too) but ... it's a lot to consider, to learn, to read
[11:48:43] <blk_panther> and I'm searching for a solution, so skimming the tutorials for img related stuff
[11:48:59] <blk_panther> think I'll miss some important parts (like browser compatibility)
[11:49:00] <arielserafini> blk_panther, or you could try to make a div into a triangle with some CSS wizardry and use overflow hidden
[11:49:08] <arielserafini> but I highly doubt that's possible
[11:49:14] <arielserafini> maybe using borders?
[11:49:42] <Zzaichik> you can create some crazy shit with css
[11:49:43] <blk_panther> yeah, thought of that, too - but I think triangles in css are only possible with borders
[11:49:51] <Zzaichik> ^^
[11:50:05] <Zzaichik> But the fact is, you can still create triangles. Even if it's with borders.
[11:50:13] <blk_panther> and that means they're not pictures but colored triangles :/
[11:50:21] <Zzaichik> ..using CSS
[11:50:47] <Zzaichik> You can create masks type images.
[11:50:58] <blk_panther> I'd need the other way round - cutting half of the div
[11:51:14] <blk_panther> Zzaichik: how I'd go about that?
[11:51:52] <Zzaichik> Well, there's a super ghetto way, assuming the background it lies on is a solid color
[11:52:03] <blk_panther> (problem I think is I want to join them together, so I could perhaps get a triangle image, with the other half black or something)
[11:52:43] <Zzaichik> Yeah the more you tell me, it seems like canvas is going to be your best option.
[11:52:49] <arielserafini> yeah
[11:52:56] <blk_panther> I'm on it, ...
[11:53:20] <Zzaichik> Good luck!
[11:53:47] <blk_panther> I think php could be another way, but I can't join #php
[11:55:03] <Zzaichik> php makes me want to throw up. But I think that's a personal problem. :)
[11:55:33] <blk_panther> well, the language itself isn't bad - you just need good coding habits
[11:55:57] <arielserafini> blk_panther, I can't read the link itself, but try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8609739/how-to-get-a-non-rectangular-shape-using-getimagedata
[11:56:56] <arielserafini> blk_panther, I googled for "canvas image triangle" (no quotes)
[11:57:25] <blk_panther> ah - I wasn't half way through the wiki links yet, ... :)
[11:57:43] <blk_panther> (and I need to be to understand the code in it, or I'll just try it instead)
[11:57:49] <blk_panther> but looks good so far
[11:58:42] <Jon47> more of a js question but is it reasonable to use getters and setters or is that something that's considered a "bad part"
[11:59:57] <blk_panther> can't I load the image into a js variable, and get the pixels I need - compose it into another var and set it back or something?

[12:33:21] <FiLeVeR10> le_gars: jQuery won't fetch local files from the web
[12:33:33] <le_gars> then what I want to do is get the HEX colour values that are stated inside the p tag in the conf file
[12:34:08] <le_gars> I know but if u use the jquery.xdomainajax.js lib it does
[12:34:35] <le_gars> wait its not a local file
[12:34:42] <le_gars> or what do u mean?
[12:35:44] <FiLeVeR10> le_gars: oh, i thought u were trying to get something on the server from your local machine
[12:36:48] <FiLeVeR10> le_gars: what format is the conf?
[12:36:55] <le_gars> no, I am I misunderstood you sorry my bad. Anyhow with this lib I can

[12:40:44] <le_gars> well it's kinda part of the whole excercise to not use serverside
[12:40:55] <ElderFain> it should find <textarea id="12314-filterMe"> and calling .toggle() on it
[12:41:01] <xckpd7> question: so I have an application I created using basically an object literal with named functions. I'm trying to improve on the code by learning more javascript concepts for better organizing and such (first I incorporated templating and got html out of my javascript)... can someone give me real world examples in which I would use prototypes in everyday jQuery code?
[12:41:07] <xckpd7> because I don't see the application...
[12:41:24] <xckpd7> in every single example I've seen, it just would be way faster to do it with pure jQuery
[12:41:28] <Melsom> FiLeVeR10: Could I ask you, how do I modify it so that when you click the same gridItem, it closes, but if you click another (e.x. different id), it will still be shown. Want to load data from an external source into the viewInfo div.
[12:41:39] <mattLUSH> damn i am completely ignored here..
[12:41:53] <Emn1ty> Hey guys, i'm running into an issue with a jquery slide called bxslider. The main slider on this site http://vehicleinventorynetwork.com/ just doesn't work. There are no errors, and the same slider is working adjacent to it. Any ideas?
[12:42:24] <ElderFain> mattLUSH: sounds like a php question?
[12:42:54] <mattLUSH> no the php page works find, its when i .load it into the div, the scripts dont work ElderFain
[12:43:00] <mattLUSH> fine
[12:43:04] <FiLeVeR10> mattLush: why not include the javascript seperately?
[12:43:33] <FiLeVeR10> Melsom: do you have an online example?
[12:43:45] <mattLUSH> when i put the script into my scripts.js, the php page doesnt show up at all.. as if it beaks the .load()
[12:44:21] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: no, include the js that's on the php seperately instead of it being in the php file
[12:46:05] <mattLUSH> make a seperate .js file for just that script? and then include it on index.html or include it in index.php ? FileVer10
[12:46:36] <w00tner> do you identify a problem with this block code? http://fiddle.jshell.net/huXUk/
[12:46:38] <w00tner> im not gettin any error it is suposed to send me to alta.php when submit button is clicked
[12:46:42] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: no, just put it in with the rest of your js that's already loaded at that point
[12:47:17] <FiLeVeR10> q00tner: you need to include the html so the error can be duplicated
[12:47:25] <FiLeVeR10> *q
[12:47:42] <MarcGuay> Is there a plugin that will add sorting *and* filtering functionality to a table?
[12:47:50] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: for some reason, when i add that script to scripts.js which holds the rest of my js, the .load() doesnt load index.php at all in my div. i dont know why that happens..
[12:48:09] <FiLeVeR10> MarcGuay: try grid
[12:48:51] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: if you just take the js out completely does it load?
[12:49:23] <Melsom> FiLeVeR10: I threw together something for you :) http://jsfiddle.net/p2Fg4/
[12:49:55] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: if i  take the script out from index.php , .load() will load index.php into the div on index.php ... but when i add the script to scripts.js, it wont load anymore..
[12:50:00] <Melsom> it should also contain a load element to fetch data externally, but i'll get that included later
[12:51:04] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: sounds like something's wrong with ur js then
[12:51:29] <FiLeVeR10> Melsom: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/p2Fg4/1/
[12:51:59] <mattLUSH> FileVer10:   if i go to root/index.php  the script works, it auto loads.  with the script still on index.php, if i go to root/index.html it loads fine but the script no longer works...
[12:53:03] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: any errors?
[12:53:11] <mattLUSH> if i cut the script from index.php and add it to scripts.js , it no longer .load() index.php in the div on index.html
[12:53:41] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: put the js in script.js but outside and below the load function
[12:54:10] <Melsom> FiLeVeR10: yes, yes! thank you very much :)
[12:54:22] <FiLeVeR10> Melsom: np
[12:55:48] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: ok i just did that, its extremely annoying, because i add that code to scripts.js and now it doesnt load index.php on index.html
[12:56:35] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: is the server set to run php in an html file?
[12:56:56] <w00tner> why this doesnt send me to the php file?? http://fiddle.jshell.net/huXUk/3/
[12:57:30] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: yes, runs the php in html... until I add that script to the js file... its extremely frustrating
[12:58:09] <FiLeVeR10> mattLYSH: http://fiddle.jshell.net/huXUk/4/
[12:58:43] <w00tner> what was the problem filever ?
[12:58:54] <w00tner> u sent my code to matt hehe
[12:59:02] <Crshman> anyone know any good irc rooms to discuss app architecture?
[13:03:31] <FiLeVeR10> sorry w00t
[13:03:44] <FiLeVeR10> does that work now?
[13:04:06] <w00tner> when i use the code in the fiddle it sends me to the php file
[13:04:23] <w00tner> but as soon as i paste it in the index file i just ignores the click event
[13:04:32] <w00tner> but it doeesnt do the default
[13:04:36] <w00tner> is not passing
[13:04:47] <w00tner> my fucking heart is going to explote
[13:05:29] <w00tner> is this ok? $("form#formReg").submit(function(e) {
[13:05:39] <w00tner> when the form named formReg is submitted
[13:05:56] <w00tner> then i have this ajax post for the php file
[13:06:07] <w00tner> but i dont get redirected to it
[13:06:11] <FiLeVeR10> why are you using ajax if it redirects anyway?
[13:06:20] <FiLeVeR10> why not just use php...
[13:06:32] <w00tner> is for a native app
[13:06:35] <FiLeVeR10> ah
[13:06:36] <w00tner> i need to do it with jquery
[13:06:53] <FiLeVeR10> make the redirect part of the success funtion then?
[13:07:00] <eightfold> i have an <ul> containing some <li>'s. when i click the first of the <li>s i want text to appear in a certain div. when i click the second <div> other text to appear in the same <div> etc. i guess this is what jquery/js is for. I need a rather quick solution and i wonder what this might be called?
[13:07:07] <eightfold> if i want to google
[13:07:09] <ElderFain> Any thoughts on whats wrong with my selector for the text area? http://jsfiddle.net/y39Sc/1/
[13:07:12] <eightfold> seems it might be so simple there isn't even a term for it
[13:08:11] <w00tner> how 
[13:08:14] <w00tner> ?
[13:08:43] <arielserafini> ElderFain, looking
[13:08:54] <jammsen> is there a howto on display a div and slide in login box and slide out?
[13:09:06] <arielserafini> ElderFain, also you don't need to add <html> and <body> in jsfiddle
[13:09:13] <ElderFain> arielserafini: was my first time =0
[13:09:16] <ElderFain> (using jsfiddle)
[13:09:18] <jammsen> i dont want to make the same mistakes that shouldnt happen
[13:09:25] <arielserafini> I know :)
[13:09:31] <arielserafini> it will still work, but you don't NEED to
[13:09:41] <ElderFain> well the issue was I didn't realize i ahd to press "run"
[13:09:47] <ElderFain> so i was thinking "why won't my selects show up??"
[13:09:59] <arielserafini> haha
[13:10:03] <arielserafini> yeah :)
[13:10:13] <w00tner> im gonna bomb jquery's hd
[13:10:17] <w00tner> hq
[13:10:23] <w00tner> aaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhhhhhh

[13:11:04] <FiLeVeR10> w00t: document.location.href='the_link_to_go_to.html';
[13:11:19] <w00tner> but is it going to post my variables ??
[13:11:28] <w00tner> the php file inserts data to a remote mysql db
[13:11:39] <FiLeVeR10> should
[13:11:51] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: ive made a seperate file for the script and its same issue. works on root/index.php but doesnt work when loaded on root/index.html
[13:12:15] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: doesn't sound like a jquery/js problem then
[13:12:21] <arielserafini> ElderFain, is this acceptable? http://jsfiddle.net/y39Sc/2/
[13:12:38] <mattLUSH> Filever10: what would it be?
[13:13:00] <ElderFain> wait why did that work.. i swear i tried that..
[13:13:02] * ElderFain looks again
[13:13:13] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: not sure, but js should work the same whether it's php or html
[13:13:36] <arielserafini> ElderFain, http://jsfiddle.net/y39Sc/3/
[13:13:49] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: why not use a php file instead og html since it works?
[13:13:49] <arielserafini> ElderFain, you were trying to select an input type=text, but it's a textarea
[13:14:24] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: http://pastebin.com/fAUNVmRD
[13:16:08] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: ur getting illegal character errors, check ur console log and google should be able to help
[13:16:16] <ElderFain> arielserafini: bing sure enough..
[13:16:20] <ElderFain> works as expected now..
[13:16:24] <ElderFain> thank you miss
[13:16:27] <ElderFain> ma'am
[13:16:31] <ElderFain> whatever =0
[13:16:32] <arielserafini> i'm a dude
[13:16:33] <arielserafini> but sure
[13:16:34] <arielserafini> :D
[13:16:38] <ElderFain> well i was gonna say sir
[13:16:42] <ElderFain> but i saw ariel so
[13:16:48] <FiLeVeR10> lol
[13:16:48] <arielserafini> haha
[13:19:03] <w00tner> Note: if you are creating your forms on-the-fly then you will need to use the live() event handler with your submit() event handler.
[13:19:05] <w00tner> i got that
[13:19:13] <w00tner> ho do i use the live with the submit ??
[13:19:22] <w00tner> $('form#formReg').submit(function(){
[13:19:23] <w00tner> there
[13:19:34] <w00tner> beacuse im creating my forms on the fly
[13:20:13] <FiLeVeR10> $('form#formReg').each().submit(function(){ ??
[13:20:27] <w00tner> is that the same as .live ?
[13:20:27] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: how do you know? i looked at error log, and i dont see the errors..
[13:20:58] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: console. not error log. use firebug, or inspeact element and go to console
[13:21:09] <FiLeVeR10> no w00t it's not
[13:22:11] <FiLeVeR10> w00t: call it inside of the other then
[13:22:44] <FiLeVeR10> do a live function inside of submit, or the other way around depending on what ur trying to do
[13:23:08] <w00tner> can you throw me some code ?
[13:23:36] <FiLeVeR10> w00t: show me a live example of the form and I can try
[13:24:04] <w00tner> ok
[13:24:13] <w00tner> www.cuponaria.com/json/#alta
[13:24:33] <alta> bah the highlights >.>
[13:25:42] <diamonds> !broken
[13:25:46] <diamonds> .broken
[13:25:53] <diamonds> I thought there was something saved for that
[13:26:07] <diamonds> for when ppl say "jquery is broken"
[13:26:21] <FiLeVeR10> w00t: do you need live at that point? why not give the forms a class, then the js can just say $('form.className').live().submit(function(){
[13:26:27] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: i love you i fixed, apparently there was space? i didnt know that would mess it up!
[13:26:42] <w00tner> ok let me try
[13:27:15] <FiLeVeR10> mattLush: the space wasn't the prob then, it's the file format. i normally do everything in utf-8 to avoid those things
[13:27:35] <FiLeVeR10> mixing utf and ascii formats causes issues
[13:27:57] <FiLeVeR10> same reason when you copy and paste text you get wierd characters sometimes
[13:28:32] <w00tner> my form id is: formReg
[13:28:47] <w00tner> is the same to type $('form#formReg').live().submit(function(){
[13:28:49] <w00tner> isnt it?
[13:28:50] <mattLUSH> FileVer10: yeah it said that there were 2 illegal charaters.. but what i saw was white space.. i deleted it, and it works...
[13:29:00] <FiLeVeR10> w00t: so give it a class instead... then it can apply to multiple forms...
[13:29:26] <FiLeVeR10> mattLUSH: you can't see encoding problems, just the result of them
[13:30:13] <gnarf> w00tner: don't use .live()
[13:30:18] <gnarf> ?live
[13:30:19] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:30:19] <FiLeVeR10> shouldn't need it
[13:30:22] <w00tner> oh ok, i see...
[13:30:32] <w00tner> gnarf: i already tried everything
[13:30:45] <w00tner> i have it right now: $('form#formReg').live().submit(function()
[13:30:50] <gnarf> w00tner: okay, then I'll stop trying to fix your problem
[13:31:04] <w00tner> i didnt mean that
[13:31:05] <FiLeVeR10> $('form.formReg').submit(function()
[13:31:10] <gnarf> .live() does nothing
[13:31:15] <FiLeVeR10> at all
[13:31:17] <gnarf> what are you actually trying to do
[13:31:32] <gnarf> and what version of jQuery are you using
[13:31:33] <FiLeVeR10> he's creating forms on the fly and wants the codes to apply to them all
[13:31:34] <w00tner> im trying to get a php file and inser data into a  mysql db
[13:31:59] <w00tner> jquery.mobile-1.0.1.min.js
[13:32:06] <gnarf> w00tner: thats not jquery
[13:32:08] <gnarf> thats mobile
[13:32:14] <gnarf> what version of jquery core are you using
[13:32:29] <w00tner> and  jQuery JavaScript Library v1.7.1
[13:32:32] <gnarf> okay
[13:32:50] <gnarf> $(document).on("submit", "#formReg", function(){})
[13:33:03] <gnarf> although i would suggest binding to some container other than "document"
[13:33:13] <gnarf> ?on
[13:33:13] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:33:13] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised on().
[13:33:16] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised on()." in jQuery Docs.
[13:33:42] <w00tner> http://fiddle.jshell.net/2uSVZ/ that's my document ready funct
[13:33:49] <w00tner> ok i will try it
[13:37:59] <wachpwnski1> what is a good div scroller?
[13:40:12] <w00tner> bah fuk this shit
[13:40:19] <w00tner> thakn you for ur time
[13:40:56] <w00tner> im going to kill some people in gta
[13:41:26] <bamotarp> gentoo.de fascist?
[13:42:03] <w00tner> im going to create a skin for a building jquery's hq look alike.. then im going to use nuttertools and professionaltools cheat codes and bomb and burn the place
[13:43:30] <MistuhKurtz> wachpwnski1, you can animate the scrollTop property
[13:43:52] <monkey_> Guys, hi. A really short question. I am using jquery ui draggable. Is it really bad to do $(div).draggable() for each element i want to be draggable, instead of $(".someclass").draggable() but once?
[13:44:01] <wachpwnski1> MistuhKurtz: I'm looking to make a scroller that handles the over flow
[13:44:48] <MistuhKurtz> wachpwnski1, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6406843/detect-if-text-has-overflown
[13:45:02] <MistuhKurtz> same applies for scrollHeight vs height
[13:45:18] <toddWork> i'm trying to do page.$grid = $('"' + id + '"');  where id = #myid. but i'm getting and 'unrecognized expression: ""' error
[13:45:59] <MistuhKurtz> check for a difference, and if there is one, $('div').animate({scrollTop: myDifference});
[13:46:00] <monkey_> toddWork: just do $(id)
[13:46:09] <Antera> hello
[13:46:18] <wilornel> $('#myid')
[13:46:26] <monkey_> Sorry, for repeating same message
[13:46:27] <monkey_> Guys, hi. A really short question. I am using jquery ui draggable. Is it really bad to do $(div).draggable() for each element i want to be draggable, instead of $(".someclass").draggable() but once?
[13:46:40] <Antera> i'm using .load(url) in Jquery ;   $('#a').click(function() { )
[13:46:43] <Antera> oops
[13:46:55] <toddWork> monkey_:  then i get an array version.
[13:47:08] <toddWork> [<div>, context: #document, selector: "#grid-1"]
[13:47:32] <toddWork> oh
[13:47:35] <wilornel> can you show us the code?
[13:47:42] <toddWork> $(id)[0]. thanks monkey_
[13:47:54] <wilornel> ....
[13:47:57] <monkey_> toddWork:  :) you are welcome
[13:48:08] <NoiseEee> monkey_: why choose the former versus the latter?
[13:48:10] <Antera> i'm using .load(url) in Jquery ;   $("#p").click(function(){ $("#c").load(url);	return false; });  --> it makes the page "bump" ; but with alert('bla') instead of .load() the page doesnt bump, why does .load() makes bump the page please ?
[13:48:41] <toddWork> in my case, i can't use $('#myid') because it is a variable.
[13:49:16] <toddWork> (unless i'm missing something)
[13:49:32] <razzi> that's a big odd, todd
[13:49:55] * razzi (heh)
[13:50:03] <monkey_> NoiseEee: actually, i am using knockoutJs, and i have a problem there :) so that was more theoretical question
[13:50:39] <monkey_> NoiseEee: How bad will be $(div).draggable*10 times comparing to $(".someClass").draggable * 1 :)
[13:51:04] <NoiseEee> monkey_: i suppose you could jsperf it
[13:53:33] <monkey_> NoiseEee: yeeah. probably i will. thanks!
[14:04:50] <xorl> good...
[14:04:54] <xorl> anyone from brazil???
[14:05:11] <arielserafini> why would that matter, xorl?
[14:05:39] <xckpd7> http://www.slideshare.net/SlexAxton/how-to-manage-large-jquery-apps
[14:05:47] <xckpd7> can someone explain some stuff in this link to me?
[14:05:58] <xckpd7> specifically, the need for doing Object.create?
[14:06:06] <xorl> arielserafini, mu native language is portuguese, sometimes its batter to explain somethings on my native language...
[14:06:09] <xckpd7> on pg #23
[14:06:16] <xorl> arielserafini
[14:08:18] <xorl> i wanna know how to handle axceptions trowed by a ViewDetail, for example... does anyone knows?
[14:12:40] <jrockjiggz> xckpd7: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709612/using-object-create-instead-of-new
[14:26:40] <xckpd7> jrockjiggz: no... not specifically object create
[14:26:56] <xckpd7> jrockjiggz: I want to know why would you go through all that trouble to make that modular
[14:27:31] <jacobroufa> ping gnarf
[14:27:38] <xckpd7> like on pg 28... the dom bridge... all that code, just to toggle a class on something
[14:27:42] <gnarf> yo
[14:28:16] <jacobroufa> gnarf, you at work today? wanted to run something by you if youve got some free time to sit and look at it
[14:29:10] <gnarf> jacobroufa: lol - close the window? :) I'm at home, but if you can "show" it via online I'm all ears :)
[14:29:33] <jacobroufa> haha yeah accidentally... whoops!
[14:29:52] <jacobroufa> erm. could possibly but you dont have access to my server :p
[14:30:00] <gnarf> jacobroufa: skype screenshare?
[14:31:09] <jacobroufa> ha. and pay for their service? actually though, theres a screensharing webapp i found the other day. lemme find a link
[14:31:20] <gnarf> jacobroufa: screenshare is free for non-conf calls
[14:36:50] <ElderFain> i have a jquery .change function thats setup in document.ready, and it works great on initial page load. But users can modify the data which will render a new partial via rails/ruby and add more elements into the DOM. after elements are added, the jquery .change stops functioning
[14:37:07] <ElderFain> and im pretty much at a total loss as to why
[14:54:39] <delac> some reason I can't "join" three sortable lists with connectWith so that I could drag and drop freely between them. should it even be possible?
[14:57:57] <seich> ElderFain: New elements don't have any events, you'd need to make sure the change event is added to all new elements as they are added
[14:58:19] <ElderFain> hm but it stops working on the previous one
[14:58:20] <ElderFain> oh
[14:58:21] <ElderFain> i bet its redrawn
[14:58:23] <ElderFain> yeah it is
[14:58:25] <ElderFain> okay hmm
[14:59:22] <ElderFain> well shit that kind of sucks, let me think longer on how i might solve that
[14:59:50] <seich> ElderFain: just use $("container").on("change", "elem", function(){});
[15:00:05] <seich> ElderFain: where container is the place where you are adding elems
[15:00:51] <ElderFain> okay i think i have a high enough level one.. a <tr class="blah">
[15:01:02] <ElderFain> nope wait gotta go higher
[15:02:46] <ElderFain> seich: well right now its $('select[name*="-userChoice"]').change(function(){});
[15:03:54] <seich> ElderFain: oh wait, you are adding options to an element?
[15:03:56] <ElderFain> so we'd have something like $("#myDivId").on("change",$('select[name*="-userChoice"]'),function(){});
[15:04:04] <ElderFain> seich: no, im adding more rows that have options
[15:04:14] <ElderFain> like a + button
[15:04:35] <ElderFain> so each + adds another row with a new selection that i need to be alerted when its changed, via the $('select[name*="-userChoice"]').change
[15:05:52] <seich> oh, ok then, you can try something like $("rowContainer").on("change", 'select[name*="-userChoice"]', function() {});
[15:06:10] <seich> I think something along those lines should work
[15:06:29] <ElderFain> right, my reading of that jquery is its going to add some sort of event handler in the document ready that watchs that dom element for any changes
[15:06:32] <ElderFain> and if so, add a new handler to it
[15:06:41] <ElderFain> lets give it a whirl
[15:09:42] <seich> ElderFain: yeah, something like that.
[15:10:25] <dogarrhea2> "typeerror no default value" this means wut?
[15:12:35] <ElderFain> seich: doesn't work, after removing & adding an element, the new eleent fails to trigger the change function handler
[15:12:40] <ElderFain> it works on initial page load
[15:14:26] <seich> ElderFain: can you provide more code? As far as I know that should work fine
[15:14:47] <ElderFain> let me construct something in jsfiddle
[15:23:10] <ElderFain> seich: http://jsfiddle.net/FndTn/
[15:23:33] <ElderFain> seich: If i re-render the portion after the comment, the selection toggle stops working
[15:23:37] <ElderFain> it works fine in this example
[15:23:42] <ElderFain> as it works fine for me on my initial page load
[15:24:12] <secforus_ehansen> asked in #jqm but not sure if this is also applicable to jq itself: does anyone know how i can show a loading page while trying to fetch syncronous (i.e.: non-ajax) data?  i put $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg() in front of the call, but it doesn't work
[15:26:46] <seich> ElderFain: yeah, I don't see what could be going wrong
[15:26:57] <ElderFain> doh
[15:26:58] <ElderFain> hehe
[15:30:25] <goddard> if I have a working ajax call that catches the success like this success: function(response, textStatus, jqXHR){
[15:30:33] <goddard> how can i output the results in my div?
[15:30:52] <goddard> I assume I use the response variable some how
[15:33:45] <seich> goddard: use console.log(response) to see what information is returned and then you can just append whatever you want to display to your div
[15:34:17] <goddard> ahh ok so .append(reponse)
[15:34:25] <goddard> response*
[15:36:40] <seich> ElderFain: I don't see how this is failing
[15:37:15] <ElderFain> glad im not alone
[15:37:24] <seich> ElderFain: x)
[15:37:56] <seich> ElderFain: how does partial rerendering work? how is it added to the client side?
[15:38:06] <ElderFain> its rendered on the server
[15:38:10] <ElderFain> and popped back as html
[15:38:47] <seich> ElderFain: but how is it added to the document?
[15:42:27] <Brenda_> hey guys i need some help.. what i need to change in my $.post method in order to send the data to my database.. http://pastie.org/4756310
[15:44:22] <diverdude> How do i move a scrollbar down programatically?
[15:44:43] <seich> ElderFain: perhaps something like this could help : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4411601/can-i-how-to-bind-jquery-events-to-form-element-load-when-loading-rails-partials
[15:45:23] <ryanneufeld> ?scroll @diverdude
[15:45:23] <bot-t> diverdude, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[15:45:46] <Brenda_> ?
[15:45:50] <ryanneufeld> diverdude: sorry, what you want is to animate the scroll-c or scroll-y
[15:46:17] <Brenda_> any suggestions?
[15:46:20] <seich> diverdude: you can use .scrollTop(val)
[15:46:49] <diverdude> seich: ok, is there a scrollbottom also? i need to scroll to bottom
[15:48:08] <seich> diverdude: I guess you could do something like : $("body").scrollTop($("body").height());
[15:48:13] <seich> or something along that line
[15:48:55] <Brenda_> =/
[15:49:58] <seich> Brenda_: does dataform get to the serverside as it is?
[15:51:32] <Brenda_> seich: lets say i add alert(dataform) i get the data
[15:52:13] <seich> but, on the serverside, try echoing the $_POST and see if the data is there
[15:55:06] <diverdude> seich: hmm it dont seem to work since console.log($(chatwindow).find('ul').height()); prints null
[15:55:08] <Brenda_> seich:  the problem is since im using a class what i want to know is how can i check that
[15:55:41] <seich> diverdude: you want to scroll it to the chatwindow's height I believe
[15:56:37] <seich> Brenda_: what do you want to check?
[15:57:03] <Brenda_> if im recieving the data in the serverside
[15:57:26] <seich> Brenda_: do this: var_dump($_POST);
[15:57:39] <seich> Brenda_: if that doesn't work I am sorry x) my php is rusty
[16:02:04] <Parhs> hello
[16:02:21] <Parhs> this code seems to work , but can it be better ? http://pastie.org/4756425
[16:02:22] <Brenda_> seich: does work =)
[16:03:10] <ElderFain> seich: the issue was the element being bound to (#f-table) in this case, was being deleted & re-added to the view
[16:03:21] <ElderFain> seich: which is why it didn't work. changing it to $(document) made it work
[16:03:38] <ElderFain> seich: alternatively, hooking into something higher than the table which isn't re-created by the partial also solves it
[16:11:42] <coldhead> let's get drunk all in this club
[16:11:50] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[16:12:21] <seich> Ah, I see I am glad I could help
[16:19:28] <r1card> Hey folks. If I animate with a selector for two elements, "complete" fires twice. Is that expected?
[16:19:36] <r1card> For each element I'm guessing?
[16:19:57] <danheberden> r1card: yup, for each animation
[16:20:11] <r1card> Oh my god why?
[16:20:16] <danheberden> lol
[16:20:21] <r1card> danheberden, so if I need one "complete" what do I do
[16:20:22] <danheberden> because believe it or not some people like that!
[16:20:55] <r1card> I might debounce it but that'd be so lame.
[16:21:04] <danheberden> use deferreds :) $.when( $('#a, #b').animate( props ) ).done( function() { /* the shit */ });
[16:21:19] <r1card> Oh, we have this?
[16:21:21] <r1card> Hmm
[16:21:24] <danheberden> or $('#a, #b').animate( props ).promise().done( fn );
[16:21:37] <danheberden> whatever floats your boat
[16:22:02] <danheberden> i talk about it in http://vimeo.com/22687950
[16:22:19] <danheberden> whoever the fuck THAT guy is
[16:22:21] <r1card> danheberden, thanks
[16:23:33] <danheberden> in the latest jq you now can get .fail as well as a stopped property
[16:24:35] <danheberden> r1card: https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475
[16:24:48] <coldhead> dis guy is hawt, dh
[16:24:50] <coldhead> thx
[16:25:30] <gnarf> danheberden: .promise() doesn't return that promise sadly
[16:25:34] <ner0x> How can I stop .tabs(); from setting the width?
[16:25:48] <danheberden> gnarf, oh, srsly?
[16:25:49] <gnarf> danheberden: back compat issues :(
[16:25:55] <danheberden> bummer :(
[16:25:59] <r1card> gnarf, that won't work which he suggested?
[16:26:07] <Brenda_> gosh still having issues
[16:26:08] <danheberden> r1card: not using .promise()
[16:26:17] <gnarf> just the fail part
[16:26:30] <r1card> I don't understand what promise does anyway; watching the vid.
[16:26:43] <r1card> what does it means promise().done() vs just done()
[16:26:54] <coldhead> promises are in many ways unlike a woman's love
[16:27:12] <r1card> coldhead this is not helping
[16:27:51] <danheberden> r1card: that document explains it (the gist)
[16:27:56] <r1card> danheberden, thanks
[16:29:07] <r1card> danheberden, man, that makes sense.
[16:29:11] <r1card> Thanks.
[16:29:56] <Brenda_> dont know why im not getting the data in the server side http://pastie.org/4756310
[16:40:06] <digitcake> does anyone know if query cycles lite has the stop/play/toggle methods available to it?
[16:45:09] <GiftigerWunsch> I'm just starting to get to grips with using jQuery, can someone tell me how .width() behaves if the object represents multiple nodes, and how to identify one specific node?
[16:45:35] <GiftigerWunsch> eg. $('.desc').children().width() ?
[16:47:17] <shoky> ?width
[16:47:18] <bot-t> .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/

[16:47:41] <GiftigerWunsch> thanks
[17:09:49] <wingy> anyone here using jquery mobile?
[17:09:58] <wingy> i need to have a mentor :)
[17:10:54] <danheberden> wingy, you might have luck in #jquerymobile
[17:11:06] <danheberden> and i'd just, like, ask your question there instead of asking if everyone uses jqm
[17:11:13] <wingy> danheberden: i guess so. that channel suck though
[17:11:19] <danheberden> that's like going to an AA meeting and being like "so, does anyone here drink?"
[17:11:29] <wingy> yeah
[17:11:31] <wingy> im stupid!
[17:11:31] <danheberden> wingy then try another outlet if you don't approve of that channel
[17:11:34] <wingy> great!
[17:11:37] <danheberden> like stack overflow?
[17:11:43] <danheberden> maybe that doesn't suck for you?
[17:12:12] <wingy> danheberden: it does
[17:12:13] <wingy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12441455/how-to-make-a-jquery-mobile-app-responsive
[17:12:51] <danheberden> that's like asking "how do i build a car?"
[17:14:01] <danheberden> not to mention how many google results come up for "building responsive websites"
[17:14:16] <wingy> i need jquery mobile
[17:14:22] <danheberden> it's still a website!
[17:14:25] <wingy> it says it handles responsive design
[17:14:27] <danheberden> you're still using css
[17:14:30] <wingy> but it doesn't tell you how
[17:14:33] <wingy> doesnt matter
[17:14:35] <wingy> bad doc
[17:14:37] <wingy> thats it!
[17:14:38] <wingy> bad bad bad
[17:14:38] <danheberden> haha ok
[17:14:45] <danheberden> best of luck to ya
[17:14:50] <wingy> thx
[17:16:02] <gnarf> danheberden: did you see my jQuery ajax answer on SO the other day btw?
[17:16:10] <danheberden> gnarf, no?
[17:16:12] <danheberden> link?
[17:16:48] <gnarf> danheberden: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12446363/91914
[17:16:58] <gnarf> danheberden: you might like the deferred action
[17:17:15] <gnarf> danheberden: also, look at johnkpaul's repo - sexy deferreds
[17:17:15] <danheberden> haha bitchin
[17:17:32] <danheberden> i love attaching deferreds in prefilters
[17:17:36] <danheberden> it's, like, all powerful feeling
[17:18:08] <gnarf> danheberden: you ever .promise() one to the jqXHR tho? that felt hawt
[17:18:34] <jacobroufa> hey danheberden. youre that guy that did that video that one time on $.Deferred()
[17:18:38] <jacobroufa> thanks for that
[17:18:54] <gnarf> jacobroufa: is that the one where his IRC client says he's sexy ?
[17:19:06] * gnarf winks at danheberden
[17:19:10] <danheberden> jacobroufa: i'm also the one that forgot to turn off my irc client!
[17:19:11] <danheberden> haha
[17:19:16] <jacobroufa> yeah, that was pretty hilarious
[17:20:33] <jacobroufa> wingy, dont blame the docs. fix them if you think theyre wrong.
[17:20:52] <wingy> jacobroufa: my fault
[17:20:57] <wingy> im truely sorry
[17:21:59] <gnarf> wingy: there are a lot of good videos about responsive designs from various conference talks online - I remember seeing one at txjs this year
[17:22:21] <wingy> gnarf: so it has nothing to do with jquery mobile?
[17:22:44] <gnarf> wingy: the same things you do to make any site responsive apply to jquery mobile
[17:22:57] <wingy> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-rc.1/docs/about/features.html
[17:23:00] <gnarf> its just CSS as danheberden put it
[17:23:01] <wingy> read about the Responsive Design
[17:23:03] <jacobroufa> wingy, i think the answer youre looking for though is in using css
[17:23:32] <wingy> but what do they mean then in that feature list?
[17:23:43] <gnarf> wingy: either way - #jquerymobile is the support channel for mobile
[17:23:45] <gnarf> please use it
[17:23:52] <gnarf> not #jquery
[17:23:59] <wingy> ok

[17:28:31] <Parhs> oh shit typo
[17:28:45] <danzik171> gnarf: bit delayed but yea your answer to the ajax thing in SO was pretty cool - that's exactly what I was trying to do in my solution originally, but i had no idea that usage of promise existed so....+1
[17:28:59] <danzik171> i had no idea doing that on a jqXHR would actually work
[17:29:49] <gnarf> danzik171: yeah .promise( obj ) storing the promise methods on object is really really useful for writing expressive code, and duck punching other promises :)
[17:31:04] <gnarf> danzik171: you one of the other SO users on there?
[17:31:20] <danzik171> gnarf: yea - @dcherman
[17:41:52] <gnarf> danzik171: nice - I spent way too much time on SO a few years back, and it shows ;)

[17:47:38] <shoky> sweet use of .promise() gnarf. me likey
[17:49:38] <shoky> don't think i've seen it used except inside jquery for the original xhr
[17:52:11] <MistuhKurtz> Hey, does anybody else see 1px-line artifacts from the animation when they click the middle thumbnail and then click 'next'? http://www.432oakhurst.com/photo-gallery.php
[17:52:57] <shoky> MistuhKurtz: chrome?
[17:53:03] <MistuhKurtz> yes
[17:53:17] <MistuhKurtz> version.. 21
[17:53:19] <shoky> i'm not seeing it right now on your page
[17:53:23] <shoky> but i know the issue
[17:53:43] <MistuhKurtz> it shows up below modal box when the modal shrinks in size
[17:53:55] <MistuhKurtz> 1px lines, same bg color as the modal
[17:54:25] <shoky> setting -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;  on what you're animating might fix it
[17:54:35] <shoky> but if you're animating lotsa stuff that can also slow things down
[17:55:02] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[17:55:04] <MistuhKurtz> it fixed it at first
[17:55:09] <MistuhKurtz> then I kept going back and forth and it came back
[17:55:23] <shoky> if it's the same issue i'm talking about, it has to do with some glitches in the sub-pixel rendering, i dont really know
[17:55:29] <shoky> heh
[17:55:34] <MistuhKurtz> well now it's doing it the first time again
[17:57:15] <gnarf> shoky: jQuery.Animation uses it
[17:58:03] <shoky> ah. haven't seen your new code for that yet
[17:58:31] <MistuhKurtz> shoky, here's the bug isolated: http://jsfiddle.net/hqAXU/
[17:58:41] <shoky> MistuhKurtz: yup
[17:58:56] <MistuhKurtz> oh well, at least it's not an IE bug that will stick around for half a decade
[17:58:56] <MistuhKurtz> :P
[17:59:03] <shoky> and if you put that css it fixes it
[17:59:05] <shoky> for me at least
[17:59:48] <MistuhKurtz> not for me
[17:59:59] <shoky> o well
[18:02:20] <MistuhKurtz> what chrome build do you have? what platform?
[18:02:33] <shoky> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=142341
[18:02:37] <MistuhKurtz> mine is 21.0.1180.89 m / winXP
[18:02:55] <shoky> i'm on 22 beta
[18:03:05] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[18:03:09] <shoky> happens on canary too
[18:03:11] <MistuhKurtz> cool another bug report
[18:03:13] <MistuhKurtz> I thought http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=142092 was the only one
[18:03:45] <shoky> well there's this dup too http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=140501
[18:04:03] <shoky> so it's happening on stable too huh.
[18:04:35] <shoky> i've been seeing it for months, learned to ignore it ;]
[18:06:44] <MistuhKurtz> shoky, so is this a CSS transforms bug? i guess animate() uses those now?
[18:06:56] <shoky> it happens to me with any animation
[18:07:12] <shoky> and no i don't believe animate() uses it
[18:07:15] <MistuhKurtz> oh okay
[18:07:17] <MistuhKurtz> I didn't think so either
[18:07:36] <MistuhKurtz> heh, wish my boss/client could learn to ignore it :P
[18:07:50] <MistuhKurtz> luckily it seems like everyone in the office uses firefox or IE, lol
[18:08:26] <shoky> heh
[18:09:11] <MistuhKurtz> I wonder if setting the dimensions again after animation is complete would at least clear the artificats...
[18:09:19] <MistuhKurtz> I could live with that no problem
[18:09:44] <shoky> i saw some posts saying that scrolling a pixel up then down does the trick ;p
[18:11:29] <shoky> or down then up adunno
[18:12:20] <MistuhKurtz> yep
[18:12:34] <MistuhKurtz> increment scrollTop by 1px works
[18:13:04] <MistuhKurtz> if there's a scrollbar there
[18:13:05] <MistuhKurtz> :|
[18:13:24] <MistuhKurtz> going to another tab and back also clears it
[18:13:33] <MistuhKurtz> so if you can trigger a redraw...
[18:14:26] <shoky> shrugs
[18:14:26] <b-ot> \_()_/
[18:14:28] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[18:14:36] <MistuhKurtz> shoky, wonder if I can use a 1px GIF for the bg instead of a color...
[18:15:36] <MistuhKurtz> darn, no dice
[18:17:58] <shoky> putting border-right: 1px solid white; in your fiddle also fixes it for me
[18:18:32] <shoky> "fixes"
[18:20:54] <MistuhKurtz> well holy shit
[18:20:56] * MistuhKurtz hugs shoky 
[18:21:06] <MistuhKurtz> that is quite worthy of posting on the bug report
[18:21:16] <MistuhKurtz> genius
[18:21:26] <tw2113> MistuhKurtz, you have cooties now
[18:21:41] <hobs> gross
[18:21:42] <shoky> ;D
[18:21:48] <coldhead> okay everyone stop talking now, you're slowing down people's torrent downloads
[18:22:05] <hobs> fuck you dad, I am going to the blink 182 concert!
[18:22:06] <MistuhKurtz> I was working on incrementing the z-index on the content loaded callback
[18:22:08] <MistuhKurtz> to trigger a redraw
[18:22:14] <MistuhKurtz> messy
[18:22:19] <MistuhKurtz> 1px border works wonderfully
[18:22:20] <shoky> heh
[18:24:02] <MistuhKurtz> wish I had the time to post on the bug reports...I'll leave it open so I remembe rtomorrow
[18:25:01] <coldhead> https://plus.google.com/113127438179392830442/posts/Y4bvmqZHRE6
[18:25:39] <shoky> this live?
[18:25:52] <coldhead> oui
[18:26:02] <shoky> sweeet, thx
[19:16:43] <rodd> does $.ajax({ url: '' }).done(...).fail(...); uses GET as default?
[19:25:35] <derko321> hello  does anyone know a way to fix this so when hovering over the button from top the color of the text changes to white
[19:25:37] <derko321> http://jsfiddle.net/rsvGW/
[19:26:22] <rodd> weird, $.ajax({ url: '' }) performs a POST
[19:26:24] <rodd> instead of GET
[19:46:52] <r1card> Guys, I can't get accurate outerHeight when something contains elements with a margin. Ideas?
[19:47:37] <coldhead> r1card: .outerHeight( [includeMargin] )
[19:47:46] <coldhead> .outerHeight(true) doesn't work?
[19:49:22] <r1card> coldhead, nup.
[19:49:30] <coldhead> ouch
[19:51:02] <coldhead> what about if you don't use the includeMargin param and manually request and add the top and bottom margins?
[19:51:20] <r1card> I don't know what they are, they're in a nested element.
[19:51:27] <r1card> I found a fix, it's what I suspected sort of.
[19:51:35] <r1card> If I add 1px padding... it adds the margins.
[19:51:41] <r1card> Same fix we use to avoid collapsing margins.
[19:51:52] <r1card> Of course I gotta subtract the padding then
[19:51:58] <coldhead> oh it might be some horrible box model thing
[19:51:59] <r1card> Minus 2, no biggie.
[19:52:06] <r1card> Then it's perfect
[19:52:11] <r1card> \o/
[19:52:23] <r1card> Yeah, it's the damn collapsing margins model.
[19:52:29] <r1card> CSS sucks so badly you guys.
[19:52:48] <r1card> But jquery doesn't.
[20:00:11] <rodd> this explains me getting POST instead of GET http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12234

[20:07:42] <jrockjiggz> I'm trying to get a plugin that is instantiated such as: $('.uploadImage').fileUploadUI({params});  but the elements do not exist yet... i'm thinking of after the elements in the DOM, 'triggering' this command.. is there a way todo this?
[20:08:59] <shoky> jrockjiggz: replace 'after the elements in the DOM'  with  'after i've added the element to the DOM'  and you have a recipe for your solution
[20:09:58] <jrockjiggz> shoky - I think you're right..
[20:10:00] <jrockjiggz> lol
[20:10:06] <shoky> ;]
[20:18:57] <jrockjiggz> hmm. is there a way to avoid $('#greeting').val().length //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[20:19:09] <jrockjiggz> #greeting doesnt always exist
[20:20:31] <jrockjiggz> i guess if( $('#el').length > 0)
[20:20:43] <__null> if ($('#greeting').val().length === undefinied) maybe
[20:21:22] <__null> or typeOf($('#greeting').val().length)) === undefinied) to catch the error. I'm not sure which one works (if any)
[20:21:39] <jrockjiggz> thanks
[20:21:47] <__null> let me know if they work
[20:22:16] <jrockjiggz> i just wrapped with $('#el').length, it gives no error
[20:22:19] <jrockjiggz> another question
[20:22:31] <jrockjiggz> trying to instantiate plugin on newly added element, but plugin gives Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'fileUploadUI' of null
[20:22:40] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: What do you want the number to be if #greeting doesn't exist?
[20:23:04] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin: its global code, if the EL doesnt exist, then to skip
[20:23:44] <Eviltwin> What I'm getting at is you can do ($('#greeting').val()||"").length
[20:23:52] <Eviltwin> At which point it will be 0 if it's undefined
[20:24:02] <Eviltwin> If $("#gretting").val() is undefined
[20:27:09] <jrockjiggz> var Count = ($('#greeting').val().length||""); perhaps?
[20:27:34] <Eviltwin> I hope you can figure out why that won't work
[20:28:14] <jrockjiggz> aint valid
[20:28:16] <jrockjiggz> its ok
[20:28:27] <jrockjiggz> actually, i was wondering what this other prob might be
[20:28:29] <jrockjiggz> I have an element
[20:28:38] <jrockjiggz> <form class="button uploadImage0">
[20:28:59] <jrockjiggz> console.log( uploadClass ); //uploadImage0
[20:28:59] <jrockjiggz> console.log( $('.'+uploadClass) ); //null ??
[20:30:43] <Eviltwin> I sure hope it's not null
[20:30:48] <Eviltwin> If it is you ain't using jQuery
[20:31:21] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin: aha u are good. thanks
[20:31:23] <jrockjiggz> that solved it
[20:31:40] <jrockjiggz> :)
[20:48:38] <Brenda_> dont know why im not getting the data in the server side http://pastie.org/4756310
[20:55:02] <chrs_> apparently john resig went to my school
[20:55:08] <chrs_> is he in here?
[20:59:02] <Brenda_> huh
[20:59:41] <Cork> Brenda_: your selecting on an id, but you only have a name on the form
[21:00:20] <Cork> that is $("#form") doesn't match anything
[21:00:59] <Brenda_> well let me check
[21:01:46] <RobW> Hi All, can someone help me troubleshoot why the dropkick dropdowns on http://my.36beta.com/grbd/ -- when you click on "Min Price", "Max Price", or "Select a City" drop downs, then try to click the scroller, everything disappears... Anyone know why?
[21:02:51] <Brenda_> Cork:  still not working
[21:02:53] <Brenda_> =/
[21:02:55] <Cork> RobW: in witch browser?
[21:03:03] <Cork> ?p @ Brenda_
[21:03:04] <bot-t> Brenda_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:03:31] <Brenda_> Cork:  http://pastie.org/4756310
[21:03:53] <RobW> cork: Sorry, IE
[21:03:55] <Cork> Brenda_: please make a working demo at one of those url's
[21:04:02] <Brenda_> ok
[21:04:13] <chrs_> "which browser"
[21:04:40] <chrs_> look out for that "witch browser" though, she'll cast a spell on you!
[21:04:51] <Cork> chrs_: well its ie so :)
[21:05:00] <chrs_> true dat
[21:06:58] <Cork> RobW: wheres the script that styles the select boxes?
[21:07:39] <RobW> var select = $(".select"); select.dropkick();
[21:07:54] <Cork> the script; not the call
[21:08:25] <Cork> well i can't find the call either though...
[21:08:32] <RobW> Oh, it's in jquery.js
[21:08:38] <Cork> -_-'
[21:08:47] <Cork> that doesn't make sense, but anyway
[21:09:02] <RobW> i'm not sure what you're asking
[21:09:14] <Cork> RobW: give me a sec
[21:09:15] <Eviltwin> The file that ends with .css
[21:09:24] <Eviltwin> That styles your elements
[21:09:37] <RobW> http://my.36beta.com/grbd/wp-content/themes/grbd/style.css ? that's not a script
[21:09:45] <Brenda_> i guess the problem is with the php class
[21:09:54] <RobW> hah, it's alll the .dk_*
[21:09:56] <ag4ve> what's wrong with this: $.getJSON('/fr', $(document).ready(function (data) { console.log(data) } ); );
[21:10:07] <ag4ve> i get anerror that data is undefined
[21:10:26] <Cork> ag4ve: you can't use document ready there
[21:10:26] <danheberden> ag4ve: i.. i don't event
[21:10:27] <RobW> $.getJSON('path', function(data) { console.log(data); })
[21:10:52] <danheberden> that's like turning the key to 'start' in a car when it's already running
[21:10:56] <danheberden> you're just gonna hear a grinding noise
[21:11:02] <RobW> $(document).ready(function() {  $.getJSON('/fr', function(data) { console.log(data); }); }); perhaps
[21:11:15] <coldhead> grinding noise is good, right?
[21:11:18] <RobW> heh
[21:11:30] <danheberden> coldhead: depends if it's followed by a moan
[21:11:32] <danheberden> or squeel
[21:11:42] <ag4ve> i sorta wanted it to get the data before the document was ready. i just need to have the document ready before i use it
[21:12:34] <ag4ve> i'm getting quite a bit of data so it'll have a noticable affect on load time
[21:12:50] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: or preceded by
[21:13:15] * coldhead takes notes
[21:13:24] <RobW> ag4ve: you're defeating the purpose then.
[21:13:37] <ag4ve> RobW: purpose?
[21:14:15] <danheberden> i've never tried that before docReady
[21:15:05] <danheberden> i'd `var req = $.ajax({url: '/fr', dataType: 'json'}); $(document).ready(function(){ req.done( function(data){ /* use data */ }); });
[21:15:21] <danheberden> but, you know, i'm a deferred whore
[21:15:28] <danheberden> so OF COURSE i'd recommend that
[21:15:47] <Cork> RobW: that extension was designed for jquery < 1.5
[21:16:11] <RobW> eh
[21:16:18] <Cork> RobW: i don't think it makes assumptions in how events propagate in older jquery versions
[21:16:22] <Cork> uh...
[21:16:31] <Cork> that came out wronge
[21:16:42] <RobW> as did that :D
[21:16:51] <Cork> it makes assumptions in how events propagate in older versions of jquery versions
[21:17:11] <ag4ve> danheberden: ah, that makes sense. thanks
[21:17:14] <RobW> hm, any alternatives?
[21:18:32] <Cork> i don't know of an alternative jquery plugin that looks like that one, no
[21:19:00] <Cork> i normally leave select elements as the browser puts them to not fuck-up mobile visitors
[21:19:29] <RobW> well interestingly enough, this *almost* works in mobile (same issue, can't scroll).. needs touch 'n drag support
[21:19:30] <danheberden> i normally display a blank page for mobile visitors just to be rude
[21:20:00] <danheberden> doesn't bootstrap's select thingies work in mobile?
[21:20:03] <Cork> danheberden: might be time to start to think about the future then
[21:20:18] <danheberden> Cork, oh this world wide web thing won't take off
[21:20:58] <Cork> danheberden: anything that replaces select boxes and doesn't special case mobile devices, will generate a broken experience
[21:21:55] <Cork> another example that works really poorly in mobile is autocomplete fly-outs
[21:22:42] <danheberden> truth
[21:22:53] <danheberden> that's why i make node modules now
[21:22:55] <danheberden> it's a lot easier
[21:25:47] <ag4ve> danheberden: and that worked awesome. thanks again.
[21:31:04] <danheberden> ag4ve: np
[21:31:17] <danheberden> i've been in deferred zone all day
[21:34:33] <RobW> Ahhh Cork I figured it out
[21:34:44] <RobW> it was .dk_container a { padding: 8px 10px; }
[21:34:56] <danheberden> all of your select styles are belonging to us
[21:34:57] <RobW> the padding of this element was overlapping the scroll bar.. mitigated by using padding: 8px 0 8px 10px; ftw
[21:35:10] <RobW> oh shit
[21:35:11] <RobW> i lied
[21:35:14] <RobW> I was testing back in FF
[21:35:15] <RobW> FML
[21:36:17] <danheberden> it's ok, RobW, i've heard mobile development is super easy
[21:36:23] <danheberden> and isn't frustrating at all
[21:36:26] <RobW> pff
[21:36:44] <RobW> this is why i prefer backend coding.. frontend = too many exceptions/variations/hacks/frameworks/libraries/etc
[21:36:54] <danheberden> i'd try to help, but that'd be like when a 4 year old wants to help you pain the house
[21:36:56] <danheberden> *paint
[21:42:16] <coldhead> you're a wealth of similes tonight, dan
[21:42:40] <RobW> Cork: Ok, fixed it this time for sure.
[21:43:17] <RobW> thx all
[21:50:48] <scar> how would i use jquery to ease the background position of something?
[21:55:42] <coldhead> scar: i don't think you can do it with jQuery. i would try danheberden's easing lib https://github.com/danheberden/easing.js
[22:00:12] <Cork> scar: depends on what you mean ease the background
[22:00:29] <Cork> scar: if you mean animate from one background to another; you just can't do it
[22:01:05] <Cork> well correction the new css3 stuff can do it
[22:01:09] <Cork> but thats not cross browser
[22:06:28] <gnarf> scar / coldhead - I think if you animate backgroundPositionX and backgroundPositionY you can use easing...
[22:06:37] <gnarf> but you can't do it as like just "backgroundPosition"
[22:06:55] <gnarf> at least not without a cssHook
[22:27:50] <scar> Cork, the CSS background-position
[22:32:14] <Cork> scar: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/backgroundPosition-Effect
[22:48:11] <hariom> How to unset background-color from dom element? I tried: .css({"background-color":""}) but it doesn't work. I still see the background color set by static css file
[22:49:06] <bung> ? css
[22:49:06] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[22:49:25] <bung> hariom: for one element i dont think you need curlies
[22:49:40] <bung> "background-color","" ?
[22:49:59] <bung> funny shouldnt matter
[22:50:34] <bung> hariom: sure you have the right element?
[22:52:01] <gnarf> bung: transparent
[22:52:05] <gnarf> hariom: rather
[22:52:16] <ankush> Hello
[22:52:29] <gnarf> hariom: if some class specifies a background color setting it to "" makes it grab its value from CSS - you need to actually set it to something
[22:52:35] <gnarf> thus - transparent
[22:52:55] <danheberden> (as .css alters the style property of the element, not the css styles applied to it)
[22:53:20] <gnarf> sexy advice
[22:53:25] <gnarf> ?tm
[22:53:27] <bot-t> gnarf, #3521 (remove() fails with IE & ajax)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3521
[22:53:56] <gnarf>  there we go
[22:53:59] <ankush> I want access stored object literal from html element into jquery
[22:56:17] <danheberden> sounds like it's json if it's in html
[22:56:22] <danheberden> just sayin
[22:56:53] <danheberden> ankush: like, in a data-* attribute?
[23:02:13] <ankush> Yes danheberden I am storing values in html ul element but do not able to read it my <ul class="content" scrollpagination="enabled" data-paramsource="ScrollDataImportServices" data-options="{viewSize:${viewSize}, viewIndex:${viewIndex}, TotalListSize:${customMethodListSize}};">
[23:02:35] <danheberden> ankush: a: you'll need to store that as JSON
[23:02:51] <danheberden> b: .data() parses its content
[23:02:53] <danheberden> so for example:
[23:03:34] <danheberden> <ul id='wat data-options='{"viewSize":"myContent"}'>   and then $( '#wat' ).data('options')
[23:03:40] <danheberden> would give you the parsed JSON as an object
[23:03:49] <danheberden> cool, eh?
[23:04:19] <danheberden> i mean, you *could* do var obj = $.parseJSON( $('#wat').attr('data-options') ); but that's way more typing
[23:05:29] <hariom> danheberden, gnarf: Then what could the way to reset it to the default background-color?
[23:05:47] <danheberden> "default" meaning what you applied in your css?
[23:05:50] <hariom> Not the one set in css file
[23:05:58] <danheberden> what is "Default"?
[23:06:02] <Cork> danheberden: or you could just use the .data() function, it does the parsing by default
[23:06:08] <danheberden> Cork: i mentioned that?
[23:06:09] <hariom> danheberden: Set by browser = default
[23:06:18] <Cork> opps missed that
[23:06:39] <gnarf> hariom: "transparent"
[23:06:44] <gnarf> didn't I already say this?
[23:06:46] <danheberden> that was my shitty way of explaining that .data('options') would be the same
[23:07:32] <danheberden> hariom, if you want to get rid of applied styling you either set it to "" to remove the style property from teh element
[23:07:45] <danheberden> or you remove the classes that are changing it from default browser styling
[23:07:59] <danheberden> or create an element of the same kind, get its background, and apply that
[23:08:08] <Cork> that would just reset it to the stylesheet
[23:08:14] <danheberden> in teh case of, like, an input[type="text"]
[23:08:16] <Cork> what gnarf said is how its reset
[23:08:19] <anli__> Is the support for IE7 poor even in earlier versions of jquery?
[23:08:19] <danheberden> but, like, you know that's white
[23:08:20] <ankush> danheberden but i am not able to get viewsize
[23:08:22] <ankush> value
[23:08:22] <danheberden> so i wouldn't worry about it
[23:08:34] <danheberden> ankush: because that stuff in the "" needs to be encoded as JSON
[23:08:37] <danheberden> not an object literal
[23:08:49] <danheberden> what language is that html being made in?
[23:08:52] <danheberden> ankush: ?
[23:09:00] <Cork> anli_: support poor?
[23:09:11] <anli__> I have a hanged browser when I try my page
[23:09:19] <anli__> Hanged as in "have to be killed"
[23:09:27] <danheberden> anli__: does it hang without any of your JS included?
[23:09:30] <Cork> anli_: thats most likely not jquery
[23:09:31] <danheberden> if you *just* include jquery?
[23:09:35] <ankush> yes danheberden i try this but need  help
[23:09:46] <hariom> danheberden: As I said, "" is not working
[23:09:53] <ankush> danheberden could you please come with separate chat
[23:09:57] <danheberden> hariom, you're asking two questions
[23:10:04] <gnarf> hariom: "transparent".............
[23:10:08] <Cork> anli_: jquery started as a compatibility layer for ie
[23:10:08] <danheberden> ankush: that's what the girls on the 1-900 number say to me
[23:10:09] <hariom> danheberden: Is falls back to the background defined in css file
[23:10:09] <anli__> danheberden: Good question, its  a bit embarrasing I did not try
[23:10:17] <hariom> gnarf: transparent is also not working
[23:10:21] <hariom> I am using FF
[23:10:24] <danheberden> hariom, you're asking for that and then complaining that it doesn't do that
[23:10:25] <anli__> But its not a rocket science implementation my script is
[23:10:26] <gnarf> hariom: is it body ?
[23:10:38] <anli__> It uses some sliders
[23:10:40] <hariom> gnarf: button background color
[23:10:59] <Cork> hariom: you want the os themed style?
[23:11:04] <danheberden> button's have a default colour, hence the create a new element and copy it tip
[23:11:05] <gnarf> hariom: surely it would be easier to remove the class/whatever is overriding this
[23:11:09] <danheberden> ankush, i see that PM sitting there
[23:11:14] <danheberden> but i don't want to click it
[23:11:25] <danheberden> keep it all public bro
[23:11:27] <danheberden> so we all can help
[23:11:36] <ankush> OK sure
[23:11:41] <danheberden> thanks sweetie :)
[23:11:56] <ankush> can you please help me step by step
[23:12:03] <danheberden> ankush: i don't think you have a step by step
[23:12:09] <danheberden> i just don't think you're making it json
[23:12:14] <ankush> actually i am little weak in Jquery : 0
[23:12:17] <danheberden> what's the language you're making the html in?
[23:12:22] <gnarf> hariom: then yeah, steal it from $("<button>").css('background-color')
[23:12:25] <danheberden> ankush: it's ok, it's coldhead's first day with it
[23:12:29] <danheberden> you aren't alone!
[23:12:35] <gnarf> hariom: but surely, removing a class or whatever is fine
[23:12:39] <gnarf> and a lot easier
[23:12:41] <danheberden> yeah, fuck those classes
[23:13:13] <ankush> Actually i am implement infinite scrolling
[23:13:39] <ankush>  and need updated viewsize and total list in jquery function
[23:13:40] <danheberden> whoa, how about we fix the parsing json from the element first
[23:14:05] <danheberden> we can show you how to hold the paint brush, but you're the one that's gonna have to make the mural
[23:14:36] <ankush> danheberden are you getting the scenarios
[23:14:37] <danheberden> well, Cork and gnarf can show you... i can only make crude comments and try to be funny
[23:14:38] <ankush> ??
[23:14:51] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all im having issues with this code http://jsfiddle.net/93Vr5/ , params is found until i get into the success then it loses params
[23:14:54] <danheberden> ankush: i think so - it's like role playing, but with infinite scrolling and objects?
[23:15:05] <coldhead> keep going ankush, dan is all over this like a rash
[23:15:41] <danheberden> mfoxdogg|work: params is an object, and you're obliterating that reference when the event is called again, i assume
[23:15:59] <gnarf> mfoxdogg|work: use jQuery.each(params, function( index, value) {}) instead of the for loop
[23:16:17] <danheberden> yay for scope!
[23:16:31] <gnarf> mfoxdogg|work: you have a scope issue... i === params.ids.length by the time you call success
[23:16:38] <gnarf> if you think about it it makes too much sense
[23:17:03] <danheberden> thank god gnarf can make sense
[23:17:10] <danheberden> this bourbon is inhibiting my sense making faculties
[23:17:22] <mfoxdogg|work> but the params is not an array though its properties are
[23:17:37] <gnarf> mfoxdogg|work: jQuery.each(params.id....) whatever
[23:18:08] <gnarf> mfoxdogg|work: by the time success is called, i has already gone past the end of the list... think...
[23:18:13] <gnarf> use each
[23:18:16] <gnarf> thats the answer
[23:18:26] <ankush> var newContentData = jQuery('.content').data('options'); working fine but if i want to retrieve vievsize value it return undefined
[23:18:26] <mfoxdogg|work> ok
[23:18:38] <danheberden> mfoxdogg|work: it's a hard thing to grasp at first, at least it was for me
[23:18:41] <gnarf> you want a scope for each element to hold the value --- each does that by calling your function
[23:21:43] <jac0bz1> G'day!
[23:22:16] <ankush> If any one knows then reply
[23:22:23] <ankush> please
[23:22:26] <danheberden> mfoxdogg|work: this might help explain http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/hSkaQ/
[23:22:59] <danheberden> ankush: are you making the contents of data-options a json string?
[23:23:07] <danheberden> you still haven't answered the question about the language you're making this html with
[23:23:32] <jac0bz1> I have a json object from a form, one of the items looks like this; users[groups][]  .. How the H* do i read that? I've tried, data.users, data['users], data['users[groups][]'].. Going insane over here :)
[23:23:38] <danheberden> mfoxdogg|work: and that ajax request is taking way longer than the 1ms that setTimeout is taking, ya dig?
[23:23:53] <ankush> actually i want to make object literal that can be directly pass to  Ajax request
[23:23:59] <mfoxdogg|work> danheberden: yes i do, and it works now thank you all :D
[23:24:01] <danheberden> that doesn't look like a 'json object' jac0bz1
[23:24:07] <ankush> and also update it in my function
[23:24:13] <danheberden> that looks like a query string argument
[23:24:26] <jac0bz1> danheberden: It is, that is how it looks in my log
[23:24:42] <Cork> jac0bz1: you mean it looks like { "users[groups][]": data } or users[groups][]=data ?
[23:24:43] <danheberden> can you paste the json?
[23:24:54] <danheberden> look at Cork being all super efficient
[23:24:57] <ankush> means
[23:25:01] <danheberden> i should get back to writing stdin/out node modules
[23:25:13] <danheberden> ankush: you really aren't reading the stuff i'm typing, are you
[23:25:33] <jac0bz1> Object users[groups][]: "null"
[23:25:38] <danheberden> the JSON (string format of a JS object) goes INTO the html
[23:25:55] <danheberden> you use .data('options') to get the PARSED version of that string ( a real, actual object ) back out
[23:25:57] <Cork> jac0bz1: is that the markup?
[23:25:57] <ankush> I am reading but did not get actually
[23:26:03] <danheberden> then you use that real object for your ajax requset
[23:26:05] <danheberden> *request
[23:26:11] <Cork> jac0bz1: thats just text, its not valid javascript at all
[23:26:17] <danheberden> hence why i keep saying make it json in your html
[23:26:25] <danheberden> and keep trying to help you do that
[23:26:30] <danheberden> by seeing what is generating your html
[23:26:31] <ankush> Ok so what to do for it
[23:26:33] <danheberden> and you refuse to answer that question
[23:26:34] <ankush> ???
[23:26:39] <danheberden> php?
[23:26:40] <Cork> jac0bz1: not javascript, not json or anything
[23:26:41] <danheberden> ruby?
[23:26:47] <danheberden> visualbasic?
[23:27:00] <danheberden> jac0bz1: are you logging that from php?
[23:27:02] <ankush> how can i make json in html
[23:27:06] <jac0bz1> Cork: That is a copy from the chrome console
[23:27:09] <danheberden> ankush: WHAT is making your html
[23:27:18] <jac0bz1> console.log()
[23:27:22] <ankush> its freemarker
[23:27:26] <ankush> languagel
[23:27:30] <ankush> language
[23:27:50] <Cork> jac0bz1: ok then the it should be variable['users[groups][]']
[23:27:54] <ankush> its freemarker
[23:28:12] <danheberden> so can you jsonUtils.encodeJSONString( theobject ) instead ankush?
[23:28:27] <Cork> jac0bz1: you might have an additional parent in there though and that might mess with you
[23:28:27] <danheberden> and MAKE IT A JSON STRING zomg zomg
[23:28:56] <ankush> I dont thing so freemarker do like this
[23:28:59] <hariom> gnarf, danheberden: Got disconnected. If you wrote anything, pls send it again
[23:29:02] <Cork> danheberden: tone it down a little please
[23:29:10] <hariom> gnarf, danheberden: Setting the value of a style property to an empty string  e.g. $('#mydiv').css('color', '')  removes that property from an element if it has already been directly applied, whether in the HTML style attribute, through jQuery's .css() method, or through direct DOM manipulation of the style property. It does not, however, remove a style that has been applied with a CSS rule in a stylesheet or <style> element.
[23:29:13] <hariom> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[23:29:23] <bigLanky> i have a php script that runs and calculates a score which is a percentage, i need to display the percentage in a gauge style plugin. how can i pass the percentage value to jquery
[23:29:25] <Cork> hariom: your trying to get back the os theme on the button?
[23:29:34] <hariom> Cork: yea
[23:29:35] <ankush> have you seen my html code
[23:29:36] <ankush> >>>>>
[23:29:38] <ankush> ????
[23:29:45] <Cork> hariom: cause changing color won't fix that
[23:29:49] <Cork> or background
[23:29:52] <aga> Hello all
[23:30:00] <jac0bz1> Cork: Ah! Got it :D Thank you!
[23:30:03] <aga> Why does my .dialog() call return: $("#content-editable-editor").dialog();
[23:30:13] <danheberden> ankush: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9266405/306140
[23:30:16] <danheberden> have fun!
[23:30:17] <Cork> hariom: only way is to make the background selector NOT match the element when you want the themed look
[23:30:22] <aga> I mean TypeError: $(this).dialog is not a function
[23:30:47] <hariom> Cork: I see
[23:31:22] <Cork> aga: something is overwriting the jquery variable, or you haven't loaded jquery's lib yet
[23:31:43] <aga> Cork: jQuery is loaded
[23:31:46] <ankush> Thanks i am trying to implement it
[23:32:04] <Cork> aga: before that line run console.log($.fn.jquery)
[23:32:14] <aga> Cork: jquery-1.7.2.min
[23:32:21] <Cork> uh no
[23:32:36] <Cork> aga: before your failing line run: console.log($.fn.jquery)
[23:32:44] <ankush> Is it possible to simply pass the strings and then use it in jquery for my purpose
[23:32:51] <danheberden> Cork, doesn't sound like he has ui loaded
[23:32:53] <aga> Cork: just a sec
[23:33:09] <Cork> danheberden: gah, your correct thats for jqeury
[23:33:18] <aga> Cork: it echoes 1.7.2
[23:33:19] <danheberden> $(this).dialog would be could not execute function on undefined
[23:33:20] <danheberden> or whatever
[23:33:22] <Cork> aga: the correct one is console.log($.ui.version)
[23:33:47] <danheberden> funny how i've seen that error so many times, but don't remember it verbatum
[23:33:56] <aga> Cork: TypeError: $.ui is undefined
[23:34:07] <Cork> so you haven't loaded jquery-ui
[23:34:07] <ankush> because using macro look like put more stuff
[23:34:08] <hariom> Cork: I am switching from input type to button as the css file has property set for type button but not the button element
[23:34:09] <ankush> in code
[23:34:32] <aga> Oh I though this function is part of jQuery core
[23:34:33] <aga> :D
[23:34:37] <Cork> no
[23:34:41] <danheberden> lols
[23:35:05] <ankush> ???
[23:35:16] <Cork> jquery doesn't have any css dependencies
[23:35:22] <bigLanky> http://screencast.com/t/FxkEXYMtE3n <-- anyone know of a gauge similar to this
[23:35:28] <Cork> jquery-ui does
[23:36:09] <danheberden> oh deferreds, i love thee
[23:37:38] <ankush> danheberden r u there
[23:37:39] <ankush> ??
[23:38:00] <bigLanky> how do i go about passing the jquery a value?
[23:38:17] <bigLanky> if i have a calculated value on page submit, how can i pass it to the next page which lods the jquery
[23:38:24] <Matt_P> anyone know of a standard "upgrade your browser" dialog?
[23:38:35] <Cork> bigLanky: that would have to depend on svg to work
[23:39:08] <Cork> (the screencast link that is)
[23:39:30] <bigLanky> why is that?
[23:39:43] <Cork> either that or one image for each indicator step
[23:39:53] <Cork> you can't build a loading circle like that in html
[23:40:10] <danheberden> ankush: aye, but no more ideas unfortunately
[23:40:21] <Cork> bigLanky: ex. http://oneorangesoftware.com/polartimer/
[23:40:22] <bigLanky> it doesnt need to load on the fly, it just needs to fill the appropriate percentage then display
[23:40:24] <danheberden> and now i'm working on my code problems :)
[23:40:47] <ankush> Its Ok thank you very much for helping
[23:40:48] <danheberden> unless you're an expert on loading raw input from stdin and parsing it in node?
[23:40:51] <danheberden> :p
[23:45:17] <dan> hi guys how do i convert a string to unicodes with JQ ?
[23:46:31] <Matt_P> String.charCodeAt(0) ?
[23:48:49] <Cork> dan: if you mean encoding, javascript is always unicode
[23:49:47] <dan> Cork - i just want to display a paragraph of text into unicodes for just analysis
[23:50:00] <dan> and failed to find a way so far :(
[23:50:05] <Cork> dan: so you mean converting the text into numbers?
[23:50:19] <dan> Cork  - exactly !
[23:50:29] <dan> like A - 56
[23:50:36] * Cork points at Matt_P's response
[23:50:54] <dan> Thanks
[23:51:05] <Matt_P> "A".charCodeAt(0) == 56
[23:51:11] <Matt_P> 0 means first char
[23:51:22] <Matt_P> you will need to go through each
[23:53:04] <dan> Matt P - looks like some characters have combinations
[23:53:19] <dan> so charCodeAt alone does not wok
[23:53:48] <dan> i have to pick the length and run that function on each element :(
[23:54:45] <Matt_P> hmm
[23:56:20] <Matt_P> The charCodeAt() method returns the Unicode of the character at the specified index in a string.
[23:56:23] <Matt_P> not sure...
[23:56:41] <erdos> hey
[23:57:23] <Cork> ?eval "test".charCodeAt(2)
[23:57:34] <Cork> <_<'
[23:57:39] <Cork> down AGAIN??
[23:57:39] <Matt_P> awkward Cork ...
[23:57:55] <Matt_P> that'l work for ascii like that
[23:58:05] <Cork> man bot-t is down a lot lately
[23:58:07] <Matt_P> but i think he means > 255 char codes
[23:58:40] <coldhead> b-ot: eval 'aids'.length
[23:58:47] <coldhead> thanks for nothing
[23:58:49] <Matt_P> lol
[23:58:57] <coldhead> b-ot: ?eval 'aids'.length
