[03:34:17] <hellyeah> what is the difference between focus and click event?
[03:51:26] <Xatenev> hellyeah: focus is if you focus it via tab
[04:12:36] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  tab you mean tab key on the keyboard?
[04:12:39] <baako> am trying to show a hidden field using google console but it seem jquery doesnt work on they
[04:12:44] <Xatenev> hellyeah:ye

[04:13:32] <hellyeah> what if i hover over, focus event will be triggered?
[04:13:51] <hellyeah> baako:  you should do a fiddle

[04:25:23] <hellyeah> thos methods accept some parameters if you give some number you can do this with animation
[04:26:40] <hellyeah> baako:  check the console after clicking b1 https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/4j07828u/

[05:39:54] <Andrei___> Hello all!
[05:40:34] <Andrei___> Im a newbie to freenode, is any way I can register username, and how to get invitations and rights to certain nodes liek #php and #mysql ?
[05:40:47] <Cork> Andrei___: => #freenode

[05:42:29] <Andrei___> ..
[05:43:12] <stennowork> we have a strange problem with jquery removeClass, font-awesome and IE10
[05:43:19] <stennowork> (just a sec)
[05:43:47] <stennowork> we have an element, to which we add the class "fa-spin", and it starts spinning
[05:44:15] <stennowork> we remove it again, it still spins, however after that there is no element with the class fa-spin in the DOM anymore
[05:44:29] <stennowork> we add it again, then remove it again, and then it stops spinning
[05:44:42] <stennowork> we use addClass / removeClass
[05:50:32] <stennowork> never mind, its a bug in IE apparently that doesn't rerender the DOM if classes get removed
[05:51:10] <stennowork> worked around it by following advice to just request height attribute which forces it to redraw
[05:51:18] <stennowork> nasty but It Works For Now (tm)
[05:52:32] <AdamPDotty> Andrei___: Try now over there!

[08:11:21] <Audlex> taplar: thank you from earlier.
[08:11:33] <taplar> wha'd i do?
[08:12:01] <Audlex> turns out by earlier, i mean this time yesterday.
[08:12:08] <taplar> ah
[08:12:11] <Audlex> .next().next() question
[08:12:25] <Xatenev> taplar: hola
[08:12:25] <AdamPDotty> closest().find()
[08:12:40] <Audlex> that is exactly what he said thanx AdamPDotty
[08:12:56] <taplar> then decx threw in a siblings('selector') option
[08:13:06] <taplar> Xatenev: yo
[08:13:21] <decx> groundhog day?
[08:13:24] <Xatenev> taplar: como esta
[08:13:44] <Audlex> decx: belated thanx ;)
[08:14:03] <taplar> Xatenev: asi asi
[08:14:23] <taplar> y tu?
[08:14:30] * taplar is struggling to remember basic spanish
[08:14:33] <Xatenev> muy bien
[08:14:42] <Xatenev> thats it, thats all I remember from my spanish from 3 years in school xd
[08:14:46] <taplar> :)
[08:15:14] <Uhkis> keep going, i wanna learn spanish!
[08:15:20] <taplar> the longest one i remember was something like: todo lo que brillia es oro
[08:15:23] <taplar> err
[08:15:26] <Xatenev> what does that mean
[08:15:30] <taplar> no todo lo que brillia es oro
[08:15:35] <taplar> not all that glitters is gold
[08:15:51] <AdamPDotty> il vio la sombra.
[08:15:54] <Xatenev> lolz
[08:16:03] <Xatenev> il?
[08:16:14] <AdamPDotty> <decx> groundhog day?
[08:16:31] <Xatenev> ah and donde esta el bar mas cercano
[08:17:28] <AdamPDotty> Jim Morrison?
[08:23:10] <hellyeah> hey
[08:23:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  how is it going?
[08:23:28] <taplar> decent
[08:23:49] <hellyeah> fair enough
[08:23:56] <hellyeah> i see the problem i have
[08:24:05] <hellyeah> sometimes i am coding without thinking enough
[08:24:34] <taplar> doesn't sound good
[08:24:42] <hellyeah> i will get over it
[08:25:12] <hellyeah> can i ask something about focus event?
[08:25:26] <taplar> go for it
[08:25:55] <hellyeah> when you tab to element it is focus
[08:26:03] <hellyeah> or when you click element it is also focus
[08:26:07] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[08:26:08] <taplar> yes
[08:26:25] <taplar> provided it's an input
[08:26:56] <taplar> others you have to do some trickery on to make that work the same way
[08:27:13] <hellyeah> i couldnt see exact relation with my problem https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/20/
[08:27:44] <taplar> what do you mean?
[08:27:59] <hellyeah> i can get the id of datepicker with this
[08:28:19] <hellyeah> you mean adding class the datepicker with focus event if you remember
[08:28:39] <taplar> i know what your talking about.  i'm asking what your confused about, :)
[08:29:13] <hellyeah> :p
[08:29:37] <hellyeah> are you talking about adding class to datepicker by using its id?
[08:30:13] <taplar> what is happening below the line that says //Make the following work  ?
[08:31:07] <hellyeah> this should happen when .from is focused and when .to is focused respectively
[08:31:24] <taplar> 'this'
[08:31:35] <taplar> be descriptive.  what is happening?
[08:32:22] <hellyeah> '#ui-datepicker-div.fromFocused .ui-datepicker-title' when you click this div
[08:32:34] <Xatenev> that div doesnt exist
[08:32:35] <Xatenev> in your jsfiddle
[08:32:37] <hellyeah> when you focus on this div
[08:32:40] <Xatenev> you would have to replace that with .from or .to ofcourse
[08:32:43] <taplar> it's created when the datepicker is init'ed
[08:33:02] <taplar> so what's different between the two on() bindings?
[08:33:05] <hellyeah> i have to add this class to spesific datepicker when it is focused
[08:33:14] <taplar> 'it'?
[08:33:32] <hellyeah> .fromFocused and .toFocused
[08:33:38] <taplar> those aren't focused
[08:33:40] <hellyeah> two different cess classes
[08:33:56] <hellyeah> i have to add those two class seperately right?
[08:34:04] <taplar> yes, but when?
[08:34:27] <hellyeah> when it is focused
[08:34:30] <taplar> 'it'
[08:34:31] <taplar> lol
[08:34:40] <hellyeah> when they are focused?
[08:34:46] <taplar> what are they?
[08:34:47] <hellyeah> when one of them is focused
[08:34:52] <hellyeah> datepickers
[08:34:59] <taplar> ok
[08:35:07] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[08:35:15] <taplar> the input field, which is a datepicker, sure
[08:35:23] <taplar> ok, so do that
[08:38:03] <Xatenev> Windows is so fkn weird LOL
[08:39:00] <hellyeah> taplar:  pls support me on that is it so wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/21/
[08:40:57] <taplar> what are you putting the class on?
[08:41:53] <hellyeah> can you repeat the question :p
[08:41:58] <Xatenev> hellyeah: really you should try to close the IRC for some days and try to solve problems on your own to get forward more quickly :O
[08:42:09] <taplar> what are you putting the class on?
[08:43:16] <hellyeah> fromFocused and toFocused
[08:43:27] <taplar> ?
[08:43:35] <taplar> think about that for a sec
[08:45:23] <hellyeah> when you focus on input .from or .to i am adding class
[08:45:30] <hellyeah> that doesnt correct it seems hmm
[08:47:09] <hellyeah> i cannot add class to datepicker directly because there is only one datepicker
[08:47:17] <taplar> i disagree
[08:47:46] <taplar> the whole point of this is working around that there is only one
[08:48:16] <hellyeah> yes there is only one
[08:50:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  each datepicker has seperate id
[08:50:33] <taplar> there is only one datepicker
[08:50:48] <hellyeah> can i addClass by using its id
[08:51:00] <hellyeah> so each datepicker can have unique class
[08:51:11] <taplar> there is only one datepicker
[08:51:20] <taplar> how many times does this have to be repeated
[08:51:52] <taplar> there are two input fields who reuse the single datepicker ui element
[08:52:03] <hellyeah> sure i understood
[08:52:36] <hellyeah> than i cannot seperate addClass to datepicker
[08:52:42] <taplar> why not?
[08:52:56] <hellyeah> there is only one datepicker
[08:53:01] <taplar> so?
[08:53:57] <hellyeah> i would say i have to reinitialize datepicker each time
[08:54:01] <taplar> no
[08:54:03] <hellyeah> that would be stupid i guess
[08:54:18] <taplar> what are you confused about?
[08:54:32] <taplar> i'm just hearing "it won't work"
[08:54:43] <taplar> i know for a fact it will, :)
[08:55:08] <hellyeah> my aim is to get different response in evey datepicker
[08:55:14] <hellyeah> but there is only one datepicker
[08:55:22] <hellyeah> so in practice that seems impossible
[08:55:28] <taplar> why?
[08:55:40] <taplar> bottom logic does different things
[08:55:50] <hellyeah> bottom logic?
[08:55:57] <hellyeah> dont get it
[08:56:07] <taplar> below //Make the following work
[08:56:40] <hellyeah> okey in order to make logic work i need to add different class in .from and .to
[08:56:48] <hellyeah> damn
[08:57:01] <hellyeah> sec
[08:57:26] <MacroMan> Is there a reason that append() returns the object of the selector instead of the appended item?
[08:57:33] <taplar> so you can keep chaining
[08:58:05] <hellyeah> MacroMan:  what is the reason you want to append something to thing
[08:58:08] <taplar> it's typically the standard that jQuery functions return the elment operated on
[08:58:13] <taplar> hellyeah: focus on your problem
[08:58:19] <MacroMan> But in most situations wouldn't you want to keep chaining on the new element? It's how appendTo behaves.
[08:58:34] <taplar> that would differ from the typical behavior of jQuery
[08:58:40] <taplar> instead of being consistent
[08:58:50] <taplar> no guessing
[08:58:56] <hellyeah> #ui-datepicker-div.fromFocused
[08:58:57] <MacroMan> appendTo is already breaking that rule.
[08:59:06] <taplar> how so?
[08:59:13] <hellyeah> i have to add this class to the level of #ui-datepicker-div
[08:59:31] <taplar> $elementOperatedOn.appendTo($otherThing)
[08:59:43] <taplar> hellyeah: so do it
[08:59:49] <hellyeah> append and appendTo are same thing
[08:59:50] <MacroMan> taplar, Hmm. Yeah. Got confused there for a sec
[08:59:59] <taplar> hellyeah: focus on your problem.  seriously
[09:00:11] <hellyeah> okey
[09:00:12] <taplar> and no they are not
[09:00:15] <hellyeah> i am thinking
[09:01:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  can you give me clue?
[09:02:14] <taplar> giving you a clue would be giving you the answer at this point -_-
[09:02:23] <taplar> just put the class on the dang datepicker
[09:02:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:02:27] <hellyeah> so i am close
[09:02:46] <hellyeah> the way is to addClass to datepicker is to use widget thing
[09:02:57] <taplar> or find the id and do it that way, sure
[09:03:12] <taplar> either way gets you that datepicker ui div
[09:03:13] <hellyeah> prop('id'); give me the id
[09:05:15] <hellyeah> damn
[09:05:55] <hellyeah> $(this).find('#ui-datepicker-div') should work
[09:06:00] <taplar> no
[09:06:03] <taplar> and don't do that
[09:06:09] <taplar> just lookup ids in the global scope
[09:06:44] <hellyeah> i know way to get id is prop('id')
[09:06:47] <hellyeah> am i false?
[09:06:59] <taplar> 'or find the id' should have been 'or find by id'
[09:07:36] <taplar> whatever manner you go about it, just put the class on the div
[09:08:47] <hellyeah> i have to give up using jsfiddle seriously
[09:08:55] <hellyeah> jsfiddle has weird bugs
[09:10:12] <hellyeah> line 9 https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/22/ but it is absolutely false i am stucked
[09:10:49] <taplar> "just lookup ids in the global scope" - taplar
[09:12:02] <hellyeah> but i just can lookup one time when it is in global scope.
[09:12:19] <hellyeah> is that false?
[09:12:21] <baako>  <input type="text" size="4" data-stripe="cvc"> to get the data it they can i do $(this).attr('data-stripe')? the issue is that i have alot of data-stripe
[09:12:22] <taplar> sure, you can if you want to do it that way and reuse a variable
[09:12:39] <taplar> baako: yes, but use data('stripe') instead
[09:12:55] <taplar> and what do you mean a lot of them?
[09:13:14] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/23/ is that correct now?
[09:13:18] <baako> i have data-stripe="cvc" data-stripe="card" data-stripe="name", etc
[09:13:28] <taplar> on the same element?
[09:13:35] <taplar> hellyeah: does it work?
[09:13:46] <baako> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/9sqpez0j/
[09:14:12] <taplar> that's fine
[09:14:15] <Rob_J> hey im just wondering if someone can help me out with jquery but i cant put it online where it can be tracked as its for education and is checked to see it isnt plagiarised
[09:14:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  no i didnt see any class is added to the level of $ui-datepicker-div
[09:14:34] <baako> taplar, will i be able to pick each of them? so i can create an array
[09:14:54] <taplar> baako: sure
[09:15:18] <Rob_J> heres a pastebin link - http://pastebin.com/NskPiF4H
[09:15:22] <taplar> generically: $('input').map(function(){ return $(this).data('stripe'); });
[09:15:34] <Rob_J> im trying to get the html to change on click
[09:15:41] <taplar> ^ might get too many elements that don't have the data element, but you get the ida
[09:15:43] <taplar> *idea
[09:16:03] <hellyeah> Rob_2 fiddle is better
[09:16:14] <baako> taplar, please look at this http://kopy.io/vR4sk
[09:16:18] <Rob_J> cant fiddle be checked?
[09:16:29] <taplar> hellyeah: open your console
[09:16:31] <baako> i need to pass the number from data-stripe="number"
[09:16:40] <baako> cvc from data-stripe="cvc" etc
[09:17:05] <hellyeah> i saw the error
[09:17:11] <taplar> right, $(...).data('stripe') would return cvc
[09:17:20] <hellyeah> Rob_2 jsfiddle is interactive we can see the error or result you get
[09:17:30] <hellyeah> damn
[09:17:33] <hellyeah> damn
[09:17:42] <hellyeah> damn typo
[09:18:00] <Rob_J> but it stores a record online, so i could be done for plagiarism
[09:18:08] <baako> taplar, but what does it know about this?
[09:18:12] <baako> this can be anything
[09:18:16] <taplar> sure
[09:18:29] <taplar> err, what do you mean?
[09:18:34] <hellyeah> Rob_J:  sign in
[09:18:37] <taplar> the value can be anything, sure
[09:18:42] <hellyeah> you dont have to be anynomous
[09:19:07] <hellyeah> rob_2 there is lots of fiddle if you google it
[09:19:10] <hellyeah> keep it small
[09:19:16] <taplar> hellyeah: are you working on your issue?
[09:19:21] <hellyeah> yes
[09:19:29] <taplar> looks like your trying to help others, :)
[09:19:44] <hellyeah> jsfiddle damn you and your weird bugs
[09:20:35] <baako> will use id instead
[09:21:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am thinking and i try to help
[09:22:02] <hellyeah> multi tasking
[09:22:05] <taplar> procrastination my friend
[09:22:06] <hellyeah> it works sometimes
[09:22:08] <hellyeah> .p
[09:22:18] <hellyeah> you mena delay i guess
[09:25:36] <hellyeah> i need to take a small break
[09:25:49] <hellyeah> i guess i find the way
[09:27:13] <taplar> to put a class on an element with an id, :)
[09:35:31] <sanjayortiz> newbie help: My task is to add products to cart(local storage i guess) on button click and the user should be redirected only when user clicks cart icon
[09:36:10] <taplar> so your question is about localStorage/sessionStorage?
[09:36:32] <sanjayortiz> yep, i dont know how to start. Im totally new to jquery/js
[09:36:50] <taplar> google "mdn localStorage"
[09:37:06] <taplar> essentially you use localStorage.setItem(key, value) and localStorage.getItem(key)
[09:37:22] <taplar> sessionStorage works the same as localStorage, but sessionStorage invalidates when the browser closes
[09:37:25] <sanjayortiz> i did some research online on how to do this and i found local storage but i since im not a js i couldnt find a newbie solution
[09:37:58] <sanjayortiz> for the record: im totally new to js
[09:38:02] <taplar> if your looking for a solution, sadly that's not the purpose of this chatroom
[09:38:14] <taplar> this is more of a teaching room, so specific questions are what we look for
[09:38:15] <sanjayortiz> oh
[09:38:30] <taplar> if your looking to start learning the basics of jQuery you should checkout learn.jquery.com
[09:38:48] <sanjayortiz> okay
[09:39:15] <sanjayortiz> i can read but i need to solve this within 2 hours
[09:39:24] <sanjayortiz> thats why i thought maybe you guys could help
[09:39:30] <taplar> best luck then is probably stack over flow or something then
[09:40:17] <taplar> there is also a #freelance room you might inquire in
[09:40:23] <jax> hm, any reason fadeOut doens't work on chrome but on safari etc?
[09:40:31] <sanjayortiz> can't you help me with some kind of syntax ?
[09:40:49] <jax> just have a div with some content, position:absolute, z-index: 11; and need to $('#thatdiv').fadeOut(800);
[09:40:52] <taplar> i got my own job i'm doing, :)
[09:41:55] <Uhkis> i keep getting flabbergasted how people manage to put themselves in situations like that
[09:43:50] <taplar> jax: works for me in chrome https://jsfiddle.net/kwLfLjzp/
[09:44:21] <sanjayortiz> thank you so much
[09:44:26] <Uhkis> sanjayortiz: in any case, you need something like this: $(yourbutton).on('click', function() { add to storage and redirect here });
[09:45:06] <hellyeah> hey again
[09:45:12] <Uhkis> and dont pm me.
[09:45:23] <sanjayortiz> Uhkis: okay
[09:46:23] <Uhkis> we have a lot of people here who can help, if they have the time
[09:47:19] <hellyeah> taplar:  line 8 does it seem false? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/2/
[09:47:37] <taplar> yep
[09:47:46] <taplar> your console will tell you the same thing
[09:47:47] <hellyeah> okey
[09:48:05] <taplar> and i already said to just lookup the id in the global scope
[09:48:07] <jax> hm taplar didn't work for me in chrome. maybe my chrome is messed up
[09:48:12] <jax> (your fiddle)
[09:48:19] <taplar> hum
[09:48:22] <jax> it stays shown for 800ms then just disappears
[09:48:22] <taplar> what OS?
[09:48:24] <jax> os x
[09:48:35] <hellyeah> i lookup id in global scope?
[09:48:43] <taplar> hellyeah: yes
[09:49:01] <hellyeah> yes ilooked up
[09:49:08] <taplar> $('#something') works just as well as $().find('#something')
[09:49:18] <hellyeah> and i though i need to find #ui-datepicker-div by using this id
[09:49:37] <hellyeah> is that false?
[09:49:41] <taplar> #ui-datepicker-div is the id dude
[09:49:57] <taplar> :|
[09:50:25] <hellyeah> dp13124
[09:50:30] <hellyeah> this is the idea
[09:50:33] <hellyeah> datepicker id
[09:50:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:50:34] <hellyeah> damn
[09:50:37] <taplar> lol, so look it up!
[09:52:53] <hellyeah> i really want to give up
[09:53:52] <taplar> what's so hard about looking up an id?
[09:54:14] <hellyeah> $($id)
[09:54:21] <hellyeah> right?
[09:54:30] <taplar> $('#ui-datepicker-div') what's so hard about that?
[09:54:47] <taplar> i don't understand the mental block
[09:54:52] <hellyeah> nothing
[09:56:08] <hellyeah> wee looked up id
[09:56:23] <hellyeah> and we select id for getting spesific datepicker right
[09:56:41] <taplar> yup
[09:57:14] <hellyeah> and reaching spesific #ui-datepicker-div right
[09:57:32] <taplar> lol, again i don't understand the mental block
[09:57:37] <taplar> it's an id.  there is only one of them
[09:57:59] <jax> taplar:  restarted browser, now it works ;)
[09:58:09] <taplar> jax: weird
[09:58:12] <hellyeah> i dont understand also
[09:58:18] <taplar> wonder if you had an update pending or something
[09:59:14] <taplar> so now you have the thing.  start classing it up!
[09:59:18] <taplar> ^hellyeah
[09:59:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:06:29] <hellyeah> i reallky dont understand
[10:06:32] <hellyeah> damn it
[10:09:45] <taplar> don't understand what?
[10:10:33] <hellyeah> i have to select $ui-datepicker-div
[10:10:41] <hellyeah> #ui-datepicker-div
[10:10:42] <taplar> which you are
[10:10:57] <hellyeah> i can select like #('#ui-datepicker-div'); thats neat
[10:11:17] <hellyeah> and have to add class fromFocused or toFocused
[10:11:21] <hellyeah> thats also neat
[10:11:45] <hellyeah> i have to use id. For doişng this look up id in global scope
[10:11:58] <hellyeah> i will select datepicker by using this id
[10:12:01] <taplar> sounds like you got it
[10:12:11] <hellyeah> thanks to that, i can have spesific datepicker
[10:12:25] <hellyeah> so class will be added to that id which has unique id
[10:12:42] <hellyeah> datepickers have id like 1,2,3,4,5...
[10:12:50] <hellyeah> i mean the last digit increase 1
[10:12:55] <hellyeah> am i correct so far?
[10:12:56] <hellyeah> okey
[10:13:10] <taplar> no
[10:13:15] <hellyeah> so i nehmm
[10:13:25] <hellyeah> what is wrong?
[10:13:36] <taplar> do i seriously have to repeat it?
[10:13:52] <taplar> there's only one datepicker!
[10:14:01] <hellyeah> humm
[10:14:07] <hellyeah> there is only one datepicker
[10:14:11] <taplar> yes
[10:14:15] <taplar> repeat that over and over
[10:14:21] <hellyeah> but each time you create datepicker id of datepicker is changed
[10:14:23] <hellyeah> right
[10:14:28] <taplar> no
[10:14:31] <hellyeah> dp12211 dp12212
[10:14:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:14:39] <taplar> what are you talking about?
[10:14:48] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[10:14:49] <taplar> #ui-datepicker-div
[10:14:51] <taplar> there is only one
[10:15:16] <hellyeah> so that should work https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/3/
[10:15:38] <taplar> typo in your selector
[10:16:37] <hellyeah> yeah
[10:16:38] <hellyeah> sorry
[10:17:44] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/4/
[10:18:02] <hellyeah> is taht false?
[10:18:14] <taplar> does it work?
[10:18:28] <hellyeah> actually it add fromFocused
[10:18:31] <hellyeah> yes it works
[10:19:22] <taplar> so now do the same to the to and then try it out a few times and see if you run into any issues
[10:19:51] <hellyeah> okey
[10:19:57] <hellyeah> what i understand
[10:20:00] <hellyeah> let me clarify my mind
[10:20:13] <hellyeah> there is only one datepicker so we use focus event
[10:20:32] <hellyeah> if i focus .to it will add toFocused if i focus .from it will do .fromFpcused
[10:20:35] <hellyeah> thats neat
[10:20:42] <hellyeah> there is only one datepicker
[10:20:51] <hellyeah> it is actually simple
[10:20:55] <taplar> very
[10:20:58] <taplar> ;)
[10:21:07] <hellyeah> i can write a code
[10:21:13] <taplar> your missing one small part though
[10:21:15] <hellyeah> i can do some sophisticated works
[10:21:28] <hellyeah> so i dont know what i am really :D
[10:21:33] <hellyeah> what is that taplar
[10:21:42] <hellyeah> i dont quiet understand why we check id
[10:21:46] <taplar> make your to work and try it out a few times.  you'll see it
[10:22:13] <hellyeah> i guess my brain dictates me
[10:22:19] <hellyeah> it must be complicated
[10:22:25] <taplar> nope
[10:22:25] <hellyeah> it cannot be asy :D
[10:22:36] <taplar> i can tell you, but you need to find it
[10:22:44] <hellyeah> yes
[10:22:48] <hellyeah> ic the error
[10:23:04] <hellyeah> i have a guess
[10:23:09] <hellyeah> let me try
[10:24:10] <kegster> After using $(selector).css('left', '-100%'); to bring div on screen, the text in the box smears a little bit on safari on a mac.
[10:24:21] <kegster> i can't replicate the issue but i see it on a friend's screen
[10:24:22] <kegster> any idea?
[10:25:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/5/
[10:25:39] <hellyeah> kegster:  it eems it is css question
[10:25:52] <taplar> hellyeah: yup
[10:26:06] <taplar> but chain your calls instead of looking the element up twice
[10:27:33] <hellyeah> taplar_meeting:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/7/ when you come here
[10:27:53] <hellyeah> thanks i need to simplify  my mind
[10:27:53] <kegster> actually i'm using animate my bad
[10:28:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:28:42] <kegster> https://gist.github.com/kegster/40d1db3f770a2c7825ab80f3d53b5e87
[10:28:56] <kegster> there's the code that moves it off screen for JS users, and moves back on when scrolling in
[10:29:42] <decx> never lookup in scroll
[10:30:32] <stevenli__> how do you add some px to this? var height = jQuery('.my-div').innerHeight() + 33px;
[10:30:38] <stevenli__> that throws an error
[10:30:44] <kegster> decx, taplar, i'm interesting in your "chain the call instead of looking it up" (and no lookups inside scroll)--but unsure how to do what you mean. how can i chain it if it's not a full chain (ie code inbetween)
[10:30:47] <decx> px gets added automagically
[10:31:02] <kegster> stevenli__, + '33px'
[10:31:08] <kegster> 33px isn't a var
[10:31:11] <decx> var blah = $('.mything')
[10:31:20] <decx> now blah is a memory reference to that object
[10:31:27] <kegster> i can just blah.animate() ?
[10:31:31] <kegster> or $(blah).animate() ?
[10:31:35] <decx> to check it you just look at the memory pointer instead of the dom itself
[10:31:38] <decx> blah.
[10:31:43] <kegster> ah interesting.
[10:31:50] <kegster> i didnt think that would work bc you'd need $() and that looks up anyway i thought
[10:31:54] <kegster> well i'll b
[10:31:58] <kegster> would this cause the smearin?
[10:32:20] <decx> could be many things
[10:32:39] <decx> here's a super performant inscreencheck i wrote myself https://jsfiddle.net/decx/z95roz0r/2/
[10:33:06] <stevenli__> kegster so I need to make a variable that is set to 33?
[10:33:15] <stevenli__> and then do + myVar?
[10:34:31] <kegster> here's the screenshot of the smearing (safari on mac): http://imgur.com/AKMZx4T (by the "W" on  Welcome)
[10:34:42] <kegster> stevenli__, based on yoour example, not sure where myVar comes to play
[10:34:48] <kegster> are you trying to make 33 dynaic?
[10:34:50] <kegster> dynamic*
[10:34:57] <stevenli__> I just need to add 33px to the height
[10:34:59] <kegster> decx, ^^ the imgur image for you
[10:35:13] <Sal> will the event listener ever be initialized if inside a module and without any direct call to any init function? http://slexy.org/view/s214nj96BU
[10:35:32] <kegster> stevenli__, the line of code you gave just adds 33 to the var height. is this what you want to accomplish, or actually make the object 33px  taller?
[10:35:41] <kegster> stevenli__, drop the 'px'
[10:35:46] <stevenli__> oh ok
[10:35:46] <decx> what am i supposed to see there
[10:35:47] <stevenli__> (:
[10:36:01] <kegster> decx, where "Welcome" is
[10:36:02] <kegster> to the left  bit
[10:36:06] <kegster> it smears the top of hte W
[10:36:27] <kegster> i can't replicate, but my buddy's laptop doe slol
[10:36:35] <decx> cause safari is shit
[10:36:42] <decx> there, solved it ^^
[10:37:05] <decx> that's not something that happens from scroll
[11:23:24] <elit3x> Having trouble loading json response into DataTables. The data is loading one row per character. Check our my paste for the code & response. Any help appreciated http://pastebin.com/V9mGbrai

[11:48:03] <R13ose> Is there a way to load an external url into a modal box without using iframe?
[11:48:24] <robertmaxrees> You might be able to ajax it if they allow CORS.
[11:51:53] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: thanks.  Is this overall idea is bad?
[11:52:11] <decx> proxy serverside and ajax that
[11:52:15] <robertmaxrees> imo yeah.  why pull in external sites for a modal?
[11:52:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there are ways around CORS for stuff like this, but why would you need the external content to begin with?
[11:53:17] <NitroLiq> Can someone help me with why my OR doesn't seem to be working? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XdoNzq
[11:53:41] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: right and I should be doing what browsers do?
[11:53:42] <robertmaxrees> $('.channel-grid').has( ('.button-cta') || $('.channel-grid').('.timestamp') )
[11:53:45] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq
[11:53:49] <robertmaxrees> R13ose huh?
[11:54:00] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq you have to give it full expressions on either side of the ||
[11:54:30] <NitroLiq> ah ok
[11:54:42] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:54:42] <robertmaxrees> wait.,
[11:54:54] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: instead of pulling external urls into modals, I should be making a browser?
[11:55:08] <robertmaxrees> oops NitroLiq - you can only pass a string to .has()
[11:55:32] <NitroLiq> hmm
[11:55:54] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq $('.channel-grid').has('.button-cta') || $('.channel-grid').('.timestamp')
[11:55:58] <NitroLiq> I can use hasClass maybe
[11:56:14] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq that's functionally different from .has
[11:56:42] <robertmaxrees> .has() reduces the set to all elements that have a child that match the selector.
[11:56:57] <robertmaxrees> also: even more derpy, $('.channel-grid').has('.button-cta, .timestamp')
[11:57:01] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want hahaha
[12:04:49] <NitroLiq> Weird. still doesn't seem to work. If I remove the timestamp or button-cta markup from the html, it's still outputting a width of 55%
[12:05:21] <duch_kazatel> do you want elements that have that class?
[12:05:29] <duch_kazatel> or elemens with a descended that has that class?
[12:06:58] <NitroLiq> Basically I'm trying to traverse from channel-grid and check to see whether or not timestamp or button-cta exist, if they do, then set width to 55%
[12:07:06] <NitroLiq> else don't do anything
[12:07:41] <NitroLiq> I just need to target the elements within channel-grid
[12:08:03] <robertmaxrees> show your code again?
[12:08:04] <NitroLiq>  so it doesn't affect a similar markup elsewhere
[12:08:04] <robertmaxrees> lost the link.
[12:08:22] <NitroLiq> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XdoNzq
[12:09:22] <robertmaxrees> so.
[12:09:23] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/has/
[12:09:28] <robertmaxrees> "Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element."
[12:09:33] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't return a boolean.
[12:10:04] <NitroLiq> hm
[12:11:12] <robertmaxrees> i might do if ($('.channel-grid').find('.button-cta, .timestamp').length) { instead.
[12:13:19] <NitroLiq> I tried using .find intitially but was confused because I wanted to use OR not look for both
[12:14:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you use a comma
[12:14:12] <robertmaxrees> css :)
[12:17:36] <NitroLiq> It checks for both
[12:17:50] <robertmaxrees> comma is the css "or".
[12:17:55] <NitroLiq> If I remove both from the html, the width is 100%
[12:18:17] <NitroLiq> oh wait...
[12:18:34] <NitroLiq> That's what I want...I'm an idiot
[12:18:36] <NitroLiq> haha
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:29:21] * taplar dances in his chair a little
[12:29:34] <robertmaxrees> you get that house yet?!
[12:30:09] <taplar> just digi signed the last counter they made.  -4.5k their initial asking price.  now for the inspection...
[12:30:24] <robertmaxrees> niiiiiice
[12:30:45] <taplar> was really hoping to drop them more, but really it's in my price range so any - is just icing
[12:32:17] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[12:36:39] <printForever> good for you taplar
[12:36:54] <taplar> :D  not over yet, but hopefully the inspection goes well
[12:37:23] <elit3x> if my server sends a json response to a jquery script, do i still need to parse with jQuery.parseJson(data) ? Sorry im new ;)
[12:37:36] <robertmaxrees> it depends on how you send it back.
[12:37:41] <robertmaxrees> is it wrapped in quotes?
[12:39:25] <elit3x> when i print the data var in an alert, it is not wrapped in quotes
[12:39:40] <robertmaxrees> don;'t use alerts for debugging.
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> use console.log()
[12:39:53] <robertmaxrees> and try it without the parseJson call.
[12:39:55] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[12:42:03] <elit3x> when i print the data var in console it shows [array[4], array[4], array[4], array[4], array[4]]
[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> then nope - no need to parse it out.
[12:44:59] <elit3x> robertmaxrees: thanks
[13:21:01] <rethus> I have this tiny nav: https://jsfiddle.net/8t5v9tpg/
[13:21:59] <rethus> I toggle the sublayer by hover of nav lvl1. But if I leave the red border to point with mouse to the green-one, the layer will become "display:none"
[13:22:22] <rethus> What can I do to keep this open? Should be a kind of subnavi
[13:22:53] <rethus> https://jsfiddle.net/8t5v9tpg/2/
[13:23:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/unuo8d40/1/
[13:23:06] <decx> put lvl2 inside lvl1 and use css only
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[13:23:25] <robertmaxrees> or bind an explicit mouseenter handler and mousehoue handler.
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> *mouseleave
[13:25:27] <rethus> ok, I can't restructure the divs in my code.
[13:25:40] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[13:26:04] <rethus> It's a big complicated navigation.
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> heh, then use separate mouseenter and mouseleave handlers.
[13:26:32] <decx> why is level 2 separate
[13:26:50] <decx> shouldnt there be many lvl2 depending on the link that's active/hovered
[13:27:09] <robertmaxrees> not if they're replacing the contents via js :/
[13:27:14] <rethus> It is a silly, crapy navigation (given by a customer webpage)
[13:27:37] <decx> as a german i can't stand for this kind of antisemantic behaviour
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:29:49] <rethus> So isn't there a way to do a delay of 1 second... and if mouseover inside lvl2, the "hide"-command will be abort?
[13:29:56] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[13:30:03] <robertmaxrees> that's really confusing and strange.
[13:30:19] <rethus> ok, but what if :
[13:30:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:30:28] <rethus> 1) Mouseover red, mouseout red
[13:30:35] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:30:50] <rethus> 2) mouseover red, then slide to green and mouseout green
[13:31:05] <robertmaxrees> so there's no shared root "nav" element that contains everything?
[13:31:08] <rethus> 3) mousever red, then green, back to red and mouseout red
[13:31:17] <rethus> there are
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> then use that.
[13:31:40] <robertmaxrees> you want a mouseenter and mouseleave on that parent, and then separate listeners on each nav item.
[13:31:44] <sdegutis> How do you say "x is y or is a descendent of y" concisely in jQuery?
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis flip that question around.
[13:32:03] <decx> closest is exactly that
[13:32:04] <sdegutis> Where x and y are both jQuery objects representing single elements.
[13:32:13] <sdegutis> decx: ah right, .closest() thanks!
[13:32:17] <rethus> https://pastee.org/hby69
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> oh, haha
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> derp.
[13:32:24] <rethus> this are the navigation
[13:32:36] <sdegutis> It's hard to memorize vocabularies of many different languages.
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> and libraries ;)
[13:32:45] <sdegutis> And sometimes google doesn't turn up anything useful.
[13:32:51] <decx> holy shit that paste
[13:32:54] <sdegutis> Libraries are just sub-languages :D
[13:32:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis heh i disagree, but OK :)
[13:33:03] <sdegutis> Oh wow, that paste.
[13:33:12] <decx> but that's a real menu
[13:33:15] <decx> not that div span shit
[13:33:18] <sdegutis> Btw, I'm doing something very unorthodox:
[13:33:38] <sdegutis> I'm embedding some JS & jQuery code into an onclick handler inline in an element.
[13:33:54] <sdegutis> e.g. onclick=""
[13:34:19] <sdegutis> And it's got to be idempotent, in the sense that multiple onclick="" of the same code will not squash each other with handlers.
[13:34:23] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis uh
[13:34:25] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:34:30] <robertmaxrees> why inline?
[13:34:38] <sdegutis> Because I want to simplify my HTML generation code as much as possible.
[13:34:50] <decx> huh
[13:34:52] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't simplify anything.
[13:34:59] <sdegutis> It simplifies stuff for me, yeah.
[13:35:00] <robertmaxrees> you should separate your JS and HTML.
[13:35:02] <sdegutis> Nah.
[13:35:05] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:35:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:35:10] <rethus> robertmaxrees: don't ask ^^ I have to pay it with some hours of my live.
[13:35:18] <sdegutis> I know that's considered "best practice" since like 2005 or so.
[13:35:19] <sdegutis> But meh.
[13:35:19] <robertmaxrees> you really don't want to do that sdegutis
[13:35:38] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: I've considered the downsides. None really apply to my situation.
[13:35:42] <rethus> I give it a name "Bastard Navigation from Hell" :)
[13:35:58] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis you realize that coupling html and js that tightly is a thing to avoid bigtime, right?
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> and that keeping your concerns separated makes your life a LOT easier in the long run?
[13:36:33] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: I know that people say that, and follow it blindly without asking themselves *how* it makes their lives harder in the long-run.
[13:36:34] <decx> tell that to this jsx shit i have to write
[13:36:45] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis LOL
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> good luck sdegutis .
[13:36:52] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: thanks
[13:36:57] <rethus> I had to place the other top-menu-items outside the ul-structure to be able to show them "relative position" and inline.
[13:37:17] <decx> why is there no consistency in the naming rethus
[13:38:03] <decx> like mainNaviLevel78 is the parent of Subnavi78 ul but Subnavi1230s parent is just naviLevel1
[13:38:21] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks says those are IDs.,
[13:38:25] <robertmaxrees> *from a db.
[13:38:48] <rethus> decx: It's part of an cms. Internal structure
[13:39:12] <decx> so hoverhing internationale menschenrechte should show the menschenrechts div
[13:39:57] <rethus> it does, but if i slide down to choose a link in the hoverd submenu, it disappears
[13:40:29] <robertmaxrees> right, because you want to decouple "showing the subnav container" and "showing the correct subnav menu"
[13:42:37] <FancyCamel> Hey there, if I'm using an ajax call to the server, does it need to have a callback ? Like if I'm just wanting to post to the server to be like "PS this happened", is it fine to go ahead without callbacks or is this frowned upon ?
[13:43:03] <robertmaxrees> FancyCamel totally depends.
[13:43:24] <robertmaxrees> FancyCamel usually you want to show the user that something is happening and that they may need to wait for the request to finish.
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> but i really depends.
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> *it
[13:44:34] <FancyCamel> It's nothing the user needs to know. It's just telling the server something has been viewed. So, it's not a problem then you're saying if I don't include a callback on the end of the $.ajax?
[13:44:39] <FancyCamel> Thanks !
[13:44:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.  not a required thing at all.
[13:45:30] <decx> wait you tell the server something was viewed
[13:45:39] <decx> doesnt the server send that already
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:45:42] <decx> sent
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> i was waiting for that.
[13:45:48] <decx> didnt
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet it's like a scroll hook.
[13:45:55] <FancyCamel> Heh, it's a chat.
[13:47:43] <robertmaxrees> but what are you recording that they viewed?
[13:50:58] <jquerynoob> i have an application whose frontend is built in jquery. The button handlers use 'click' and work on desktop browsers, but the behaviour is weird and wrong on mobile browsers (ipad safari..). What are the likely casuses
[13:51:32] <robertmaxrees> how is the behavior "weird and wrong"?
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> some more deets might be nice :)
[13:53:20] <jquerynoob> weird and wong as in after the tap, the button is still in focus, and the functionality of button doesnt execute even though the right methods are called
[13:53:33] <jquerynoob> let me know what deets you want
[13:54:06] <robertmaxrees> try .on('click touch', function() {}); maybe?
[13:54:41] <jquerynoob> could give that a shot, but that isnt much different form 'click touchstart/touchend' which i had tried earlier
[13:54:54] <decx> rather mousedown touch as click includes touch
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> errr, yeah.
[13:55:06] <jquerynoob> the button event gets registered and the logic is executed, it just doesn't seem to do anything after that though
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> so what else should it do?
[13:55:25] <decx> wait what
[13:55:39] <decx> if it gets executed how does it not get executed
[13:55:42] <jquerynoob> its a skip button, so it does skipping logic.
[13:55:49] <jquerynoob> i have no idea
[13:55:52] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything if we can't see the coide.
[13:55:55] <jquerynoob> this is why im so lost
[13:56:05] <robertmaxrees> need to give us more context here.
[13:56:10] <jquerynoob> jQuery("#next_note").on('click', function(e) {           e.preventDefault();           console.log("next_note activated");           handleNextNote();         });
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:56:20] <jquerynoob> thats the broken piece of code in mobile
[13:57:30] <decx> but if you get the log then the problem is obviously not the event
[13:57:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:58:11] <jquerynoob> no but the thing is, when you tap the button, the button still appears pressed, only when you click elsewhere, does it get unfocused
[13:58:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a CSS problem.
[13:58:37] <jquerynoob> https://jsfiddle.net/wahhLeag/
[13:58:48] <decx> yeah you can focus with a tab which doesnt count as a "clicktap"
[13:58:55] <decx> with a tap*
[13:59:26] <jquerynoob> if you use click to catch touch events, does anything break?
[13:59:34] <decx> nope
[13:59:35] <jquerynoob> whats the proper way to handle touch and mouse events
[13:59:39] <decx> click is just a catchall
[13:59:50] <decx> depends what you do
[14:00:05] <jquerynoob> its a skip button
[14:00:16] <robertmaxrees> that means literally nothing to us without context.
[14:00:26] <decx> doesnt matter for a button
[14:00:32] <jquerynoob> a skip button that makes the video go ahead 10 seconds
[14:00:37] <decx> but if you swipeend on a button you focus t
[14:00:41] <decx> it
[14:00:50] <decx> touchend
[14:00:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah none of that should make any difference.
[14:00:53] <jquerynoob> if you swipe its not in focus
[14:01:01] <decx> like touchend on a button focuses a button but doesnt click
[14:01:15] <decx> needs touchstart&touchend to be a click
[14:01:18] <decx> iirc
[14:01:30] <jquerynoob> can you explicitly remove focus using blur/
[14:01:36] <taplar> sounds right
[14:01:46] <jquerynoob> i see
[14:02:23] <jquerynoob> this problem only occurs on ios 9.3.1 onwards.. was working fine in ios 9.2
[14:03:35] <jquerynoob> how do you fix the css issue to make the button unfocused after the click event has been handled on a mobile device
[14:06:50] <decx> you dont unless you have a new field to focus after that
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> jquerynoob do you just want the button to not appear like it's pressed?
[14:07:49] <decx> that's :active tho
[14:29:20] <MrPinkz> have some problem, im using dialog jquery-ui, and the text(a div in my jsp) that goes into the dialog appears before the dialog pops up
[14:49:53] <Varun_krishna> Hi guys

[14:57:41] <berpcor> Hello.
[14:57:45] <taplar> you mean like a spa?

[14:58:08] <berpcor>                         .data('order', 1)
[14:58:08] <berpcor>                         .load(function(){
[14:58:18] <taplar> berpcor: please don't paste in the channel
[14:58:27] <berpcor> taplar: Ok.
[14:58:34] <taplar> jsfiddle or something else it please
[14:58:37] <decx> what's your spaghetti policy
[14:58:39] <berpcor> Ok, got it.
[14:58:53] <berpcor> Next time I'll use jsfidle.
[14:59:08] <berpcor> This time code is already here.
[14:59:18] <berpcor> Classes are assigned.
[14:59:27] <berpcor> Data attribute - no.
[14:59:29] <berpcor> Why?
[14:59:40] <taplar> you mean your not seeing it in the dom?
[14:59:45] <berpcor> Yes.
[14:59:47] <taplar> you won't
[14:59:52] <taplar> jquery internalizes that
[15:00:11] <taplar> it's still there with data('order') though
[15:00:19] <Varun_krishna> Why is click event now working in jsbin?
[15:00:30] <taplar> you fixed your error?
[15:01:07] <Varun_krishna> But it is not showing error.
[15:01:22] <taplar> share your latest link again?
[15:01:26] <berpcor> taplar: So, what am I to do?
[15:01:37] <taplar> berpcor: i don't understand the problem
[15:01:40] <berpcor> How can I assign data attribute to image before its loading.
[15:01:49] <taplar> i already said you are doing so
[15:01:54] <Varun_krishna> Okkay
[15:01:55] <taplar> you just can't see it in the inspector
[15:01:57] <berpcor> taplar: Ok, minute...
[15:02:27] <Varun_krishna> taplar: https://jsbin.com/nokahe/edit?html,js,console,output
[15:02:56] <decx> make a clone on load and then just clone that
[15:02:59] <taplar> please use console.log
[15:03:31] <taplar> and are you wanting to clone the whole row?
[15:04:26] <Varun_krishna> Nope, the text box inside that row only and then I will show that delete button
[15:04:57] <taplar> alright, as long as your using alerts i'm outie
[15:05:29] <Varun_krishna> If I use alert outside it shows up. but not inside the click event.
[15:05:44] <taplar> use console.log.  it works just as well and isn't annoying
[15:06:39] <Varun_krishna> taplar: can you use the same link again?
[15:07:09] <taplar> ok, so do what decx suggested.  clone it at the start and then reuse that when you clone
[15:08:43] <taplar> and you only have btn-add on one of the add buttons
[15:08:48] <taplar> so it only works for the second one
[15:10:48] <berpcor> taplar: http://jsbin.com/zarupaciwi/edit?html,js,output
[15:11:09] <berpcor> taplar: Click on the green image. Big image will replace existing.
[15:11:47] <berpcor> taplar: I need to set data attribute for this image. I do it in code, but I can't see it in fact.
[15:12:13] <berpcor> My image has only classes I assigned to it.
[15:12:21] <berpcor> But not data attribute.
[15:13:29] <berpcor> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mW3S0u8bj58/maxresdefault.jpg" class="large-image img-responsive">
[15:13:32] <berpcor> Is what i get.
[15:13:55] <berpcor> But I should get - <img src="..." class="large-image img-responsive" data-order="1">
[15:13:57] <decx> the data- you see in markup is just  the initial state for the browser to parse, when you use data() you actually save to an underlying data cache of objects
[15:14:44] <berpcor> decx: How can I set data attribute for my image then?..
[15:16:11] <decx> what does it matter here?
[15:18:13] <Varun_krishna> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/qtbzb9m6/
[15:18:21] <Varun_krishna> Why is it not cloning?
[15:19:23] <berpcor> decx: When I'll click on it image gallery plugin should start. data-order is image that should be opened first.
[15:20:19] <Varun_krishna> decx:
[15:21:11] <taplar> your find is missing a . for the class
[15:21:21] <taplar> and the inner lookup has 'input' misspelled
[15:22:14] <taplar> and your not appending the cloned element any where
[15:23:32] <berpcor> I've found the answer.
[15:23:32] <Varun_krishna> taplar: Where should I append it?
[15:23:32] <berpcor> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18322977/adding-data-attributes-to-elements-not-yet-inserted-into-dom-in-jquery
[15:24:20] <taplar> if your plugin is expecting the data element to be in the markup, for what ever weird reason, then use attr('data-whatever', value)
[15:24:23] <taplar> instead of data()
[15:25:25] <taplar> Varun_krishna: i'd assume the parent td of the button you clicked, but that's entirely up to your use case

[15:57:10] <codecutter> shoky: i need the menu to be on the left by about another 20px
[15:58:12] <codecutter> i'm guessing "position.x" is the option that i want, but how do i set this? see pastebin
[15:58:22] <codecutter> set the value*
[16:00:04] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[16:04:09] <shoky> codecutter: i donno anything about that plugin, but maybe you want the offset.* options

[16:40:56] <Synthead> is there some kind of keycode mapping that I can use instead of e.keyCode == n?  It'd be nice to do something like e.keyCode == $.keys.DELETE or something
[16:41:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:41:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm sure something exists out there that you could use though,
[16:41:38] <Synthead> eh
[16:41:54] <Synthead> if it isn't built in, I'd rather spare the cruft
[16:42:00] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot :)
[16:42:10] <robertmaxrees> could always build a minimal version of your own.
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> var keyCodes = {};
[16:42:30] <robertmaxrees> and then you could do e.keyCode === keyCodes.ENTER or whatever
[16:44:21] <Synthead> yeah I thought about that
[16:44:28] <robertmaxrees> i do that kind of thing all the time.
[16:44:31] <Synthead> if I used them a lot, it would make a lot of sense
[16:44:37] <Synthead> for just one spot, eh
[16:44:37] <robertmaxrees> just so I have something readable.
[16:44:42] <Synthead> yeah totally
[16:44:42] <robertmaxrees> even if it's for one spot.
[16:44:48] <Synthead> I just added a comment
[16:45:19] <robertmaxrees> s'why i tend to name functions instead of using anonymous ones.
[16:45:51] <robertmaxrees> since the name can tell you what it does.
[18:10:02] <printForever> How to removeClass after mouse leaves DIV?
[18:10:06] <mmmveggies> also allows you to recurse
[18:10:22] <robertmaxrees> printForever an event handler.
[18:10:32] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I'vetried using .hover
[18:10:37] <printForever> and .setTimeout
[18:10:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:10:42] <robertmaxrees> use mouseleave.
[18:10:48] <robertmaxrees> .on('mouseleave', function() {});
[18:11:10] <printForever> tnx!
[18:34:18] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I want to remove a div when I click anywhere on the page, except on the div itself. I tried negating it, but it didnt work.
[18:34:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> how did you try to negate it?
[18:34:52] <robertmaxrees> (show me yer code :D)
[18:34:53] <printForever> if !("#mydiv") {}
[18:35:01] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:35:35] <robertmaxrees> !("#mydiv") is always going to be false - ("#mydiv") is just an evaluation of the string "#mydiv".  the ! negates that.
[18:35:36] <printForever> .on(click)...if not "#mydiv"... close
[18:35:56] <printForever> oh... I see the error
[18:36:13] <robertmaxrees> but even adding $ won't work.
[18:36:17] <printForever> I should register the click if it was out side #mydiv
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:36:24] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:36:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not all.
[18:36:34] <printForever> not good? :(
[18:36:35] <robertmaxrees> you want if (!$(this).closest('#mydiv').length) {}
[18:36:40] <robertmaxrees> in your event handler.
[18:36:57] <robertmaxrees> which should be something like $(document).on('click', function(e) {});
[18:37:10] <robertmaxrees> and actuall,y $(this) should be something like $(e.currentTarget)
[18:37:22] <mihail-js> you will need to compare it, if (the_element_clicked_on.getName() === “mydiv”).. (i don’t know jquery though, I don’t know the exact function…)
[18:37:23] <printForever> but I'm not clicking on the docum...
[18:37:41] <robertmaxrees> mihail-js he wants .closest()
[18:37:41] <printForever> mihail-js, yeah... comparing it
[18:37:48] <robertmaxrees> printForever right, but the event bubbles to the document.
[18:37:52] <robertmaxrees> so you need to bind your listener there.
[18:37:54] <printForever> oh
[18:37:57] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[18:38:11] <robertmaxrees> check here to see which property it is on the event object.
[18:40:02] <robertmaxrees> iirc it's currentTarget but I could have that wrong,
[18:40:40] <printForever> robertmaxrees, thanks!!!
[18:40:54] <robertmaxrees> should check out the docs for .closest() btw.
[18:40:57] <robertmaxrees> it's a nice little method.
[18:42:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a good chance you'll need to stopPropagation() against that event, too.
[19:02:11] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I can't get it to work
[19:02:17] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[19:02:21] <printForever> sec
[19:02:23] <robertmaxrees> make a quick fiddle.
[19:04:24] <printForever> lol
[19:04:25] <printForever> typo
[19:04:46] <robertmaxrees> hah
[19:05:00] <printForever> it's just one of those days
[19:05:05] <printForever> its 1:05 AM
[19:05:39] <robertmaxrees> woah.  go to bed.
[19:05:54] <printForever> can't... have 3 more hours
[19:06:00] <robertmaxrees> 3 more hours?
[19:06:19] <printForever> something like that
[19:06:24] <robertmaxrees> what does that mean?
[19:06:28] <printForever> to fix and go through all of the tasks
[19:06:36] <robertmaxrees> why though?
[19:06:49] <robertmaxrees> seems nutty to be working so late.
[19:07:13] <printForever> ... deadlines
[19:07:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:07:34] <robertmaxrees> seems like it shoulda been done yesterday then.
[19:07:39] <robertmaxrees> we never say 4:00am here.
[19:07:59] <printForever> here, where?
[19:08:14] <robertmaxrees> at my company - like, we never say "the deadline is 4:00am".  the deadline is the day before.
[19:08:28] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to be working that late into the night.
[19:08:29] <printForever> :)))
[19:10:07] <arc_> sometimes the deadline is "today" but it ends up taking longer than expected so you just keep working until it's done
[19:10:26] <printForever> I agree with you both
[19:10:32] <robertmaxrees> we just tell our product managers that we'll need more time (shrug)
[19:10:47] <robertmaxrees> since having people work that late into the night is really counterproductive.
[19:11:46] <printForever> I couldn't agree more
[19:11:57] <printForever> and now I need RedBull...
[19:12:18] <robertmaxrees> burnout is a really big problem.  never understood the kind of place that encourages it.
[19:35:23] <daniel331> any good plugins for inline (not floating or hovering) tooltips?
[19:35:40] <robertmaxrees> what would that look like?
[19:35:58] <daniel331> it would look like an inline (not floating or hovering) tooltip
[19:36:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:36:09] <robertmaxrees> so it would replace the current text?
[19:36:28] <robertmaxrees> i guess i can't envision what you mean by "inline"
[19:36:33] <daniel331> 1sec ill show you
[19:38:26] <daniel331> robertmaxtrees: http://imgur.com/a/Kte9j
[19:38:49] <daniel331> ignore the black line; its a screen flicker artifact from screencapturing using the display maanger
[19:39:15] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so the tooltop is the box with the dropdown and stuff in it?
[19:39:20] <daniel331> yep
[19:39:31] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't have to be a tooltip at all.
[19:39:35] <daniel331> indeed
[19:39:38] <robertmaxrees> that could just be a div you show/hide
[19:39:44] <daniel331> yes, I had thought of that
[19:39:52] <daniel331> theres the small matter of the arrow pointy thingy
[19:39:55] <robertmaxrees> css.
[19:40:10] <daniel331> css?
[19:40:14] <robertmaxrees> you can accomplish that with css.
[19:40:21] <daniel331> easily?
[19:40:41] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/
[19:40:58] <daniel331> ah,nice
[19:41:00] <daniel331> thanks
[19:41:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
