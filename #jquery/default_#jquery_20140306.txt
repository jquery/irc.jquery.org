[00:17:39] <basiclaser> is there something wrong with this loop? it should print stuff out http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/7tscA/
[00:18:20] <Cork> basiclaser: you don't close it :)
[00:18:26] <luvmyh0nda> basiclaser: when jquery is enabled, and it's closed, it works fine
[00:19:52] <Cork> basiclaser: http://jsfiddle.net/7tscA/4/
[00:20:43] <basiclaser> Cork: thanks honkies :D i am a dufus
[00:21:49] <Cork> basiclaser: a site note; remember that for loops are sync, so you won't see as each value is added
[00:22:22] <Cork> and actually for speed i would prob build an array of values and add them after the loop with .join('') instead
[00:23:06] <Cork> basiclaser: http://jsfiddle.net/7tscA/6/
[00:23:24] <Cork> makes the script hammer the dom a bit less
[01:09:08] <basiclaser> Cork: thanks a bunch, i was in the bath ^ ^
[01:09:31] <Cork> np
[01:09:42] <basiclaser> Cork: it was actually just a one time thing, i didnt want to do 24 different operations on my calculator :3
[01:10:28] <Cork> basiclaser: might be good to know the cost of those things either way :)
[01:23:19] <jon_x10> whats the proper selector to get the value "2310"?  I've tried $('#dllLocations .dhx_combo_input).next().val() but it doesn't seem to work.  http://pastebin.com/r25u7CSw
[01:23:57] <Cork> jon_x10: that should work
[01:24:11] <Cork> though a hidden field without a name isn't really valid
[01:26:24] <Cork> jon_x10: http://jsfiddle.net/6eWa6/
[01:26:35] <jon_x10> yah I don't like that much either but its not my code.. just trying to add to it
[01:40:59] <hellothere> http://fiddle.jshell.net/HxK37/ anyone sees anything wrong with that?
[01:41:04] <hellothere> on the jquery side of things
[01:44:55] <xKraty> viewmodel is not used
[01:45:30] <hellothere> http://fiddle.jshell.net/HxK37/1/ i updated it
[01:45:50] <hellothere> using the jquery lib now the add etc should work but i am pretty sure there is something wrong in the js
[01:46:30] <xKraty> im not sure about }(); on row 22
[01:46:53] <xKraty> i prefer to prototype single function
[01:47:04] <xKraty> hello.Calulator.prototype.add = function() {}
[01:47:43] <hellothere> so .add and remove (); from line 22?
[01:48:23] <xKraty> i guess yeah
[01:48:27] <hellothere> that breaks it down
[01:48:30] <xKraty> let me edit it
[01:48:35] <hellothere> ah ok thx :)
[01:48:40] <hellothere> well the substract isnt working
[01:49:07] <hellothere> and the add has this weird unedintified - nan version when you add
[01:49:16] <hellothere> so it wont add 1+1 but it will add 1+1 = 11
[01:50:41] <xKraty> those are int or floats?
[01:50:46] <lng> Hi! Is there .serialize() alternative to get an object instead of a string?
[01:50:57] <hellothere> int
[01:51:35] <xKraty> http://fiddle.jshell.net/HxK37/3/
[01:51:50] <xKraty> .serializeArray()
[01:52:07] <emka> Hi, trying to reset jqueyr.datepicker date when selecting the selected date. It all works fine except that it adds .ui-state-active to todays date after select. Check here. Try selecting March 10, then select March 10 again. March 6 will be green after the second select by some reason! http://jsfiddle.net/ESVN3/3/
[01:52:30] <hellothere> xKraty: now its not adding any values :s
[01:52:38] <emka> Any ideas hwo to solve?
[01:57:38] <xKraty> hellothere: http://fiddle.jshell.net/HxK37/4/
[01:58:02] <hellothere> thx kraty
[01:58:02] <hellothere> :D
[01:58:14] <xKraty> np
[01:58:17] <hellothere> xKraty: that seems to work fine :) thanks a lot
[01:58:23] <hellothere> can u tell me what was wrong with it?
[01:58:26] <rs> morning
[01:58:29] <hellothere> in the first place
[01:58:31] <xKraty> emka: onselect date you remove the date, datepicker auto set today
[01:58:57] <emka> line 11... xKraty
[01:58:57] <xKraty> hellothere: when you define the class
[01:58:58] <emka>  jQuery('#datepicker').datepicker( "setDate", null );
[01:59:02] <xKraty> hello.Calulator = function(){
[01:59:02] <xKraty>   this.currentSum = 0;
[01:59:02] <xKraty> };
[01:59:05] <rs> I have cause to ask for a bit of assistance
[01:59:33] <rs> but it is going to be difficult to provide code - but I think I know the problem...
[01:59:41] <xKraty> you have to tell the class your currentSum is for every method so this.myvar
[01:59:43] <rs> I've made a "dynamic select" plugin
[01:59:58] <rs> one which loads JSON data, and populates a select box
[01:59:58] <xKraty> maybe your prototyping was correct before
[02:00:19] <rs> I've got another plugin, that creates three of these dynamic selects
[02:00:30] <xKraty> i m not so good on such thing, but i like the singleton
[02:00:33] <xKraty> and it always works :D
[02:00:43] <rs> the issue is that the content of the final select, has the content of all of the other selects
[02:00:45] <rs> my theory:
[02:01:06] <rs> I'm ajaxing in the number of select boxes to be shown, and those select boxes are ajaxing in their content
[02:01:40] <rs> for some reason the $holder in my dynamicSelect plugin, is not maintaining what it is pointing to.
[02:01:42] <xKraty> emka: it's your css
[02:01:48] <emka> no...
[02:01:58] <xKraty> emka: http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/ESVN3/4/
[02:02:04] <rs> has anyone had similar issues with dynamic content / ajaxing
[02:02:12] <emka> xKraty: why does ui-state-active apply to todays date after removeing the date?
[02:02:13] <xKraty> it keep the today highlighted but not active there
[02:02:32] <rs> I'll try pasting into pastebin
[02:02:40] <emka> xKraty: inspect the HTML...
[02:02:57] <hellothere> xKraty: http://fiddle.jshell.net/95K2Z/ thats the way it was done before
[02:03:05] <emka> i wonder why march 6 gets the class ui-state-active when removing the selected date.
[02:03:17] <emka> nothing wrong with the css...
[02:03:39] <emka> the problem is I do not want that class applied when I dont have any active date!
[02:03:47] <rs> dynamicselect: http://pastebin.com/1aJP9bAk
[02:04:43] <Cork> rs: sounds like a global variable problem
[02:04:53] <Cork> or possibly a selector
[02:05:13] <rs> teamselect
[02:05:13] <rs> http://pastebin.com/UW4tLC0v
[02:05:13] <rs> any help would be fantastic
[02:05:13] <rs> function of interest is probably createSelect in the teamselect one
[02:05:26] <rs> yea - I thought that, the $holder is locally scoped in the plugin closure (I think)
[02:05:32] <Cork> rs: $.fn isn't called once per elements
[02:05:40] <Cork> you get one call for all matches
[02:05:50] <Cork> so dynamicSelect should use this.each to loop the targets
[02:06:11] <Cork> and use something like .data() to store individual values for each element
[02:06:17] <Sejo_> Hello guys
[02:06:44] <rs> yep, dynamicSelect isn't selecting though?
[02:06:45] <Sejo_> I have a problem with jquery and jquerymobile, can anybody please help me :)
[02:06:45] <Sejo_> i posted in the forum as well
[02:06:45] <Sejo_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-noconflict-jquery-mobile
[02:06:54] <rs> it gets called on an object
[02:07:03] <Cork> rs: ya
[02:07:03] <rs> which is then stored in $holder ?
[02:07:16] <Cork> ya, and that is where things goes wrong
[02:07:44] <Sejo_> anybody?
[02:07:46] <Cork> rs: you expect this in $.fn.teamSelector to always be one element
[02:08:08] <Cork> rs: and you expect $$.fn.teamSelector to ever only be called once
[02:08:14] <Cork> cause $holder is global to the plugin
[02:08:25] <rs> ah!!!
[02:08:27] <Cork> so it can't ever work with more then one element
[02:08:41] <Cork> so you break on multiple levels
[02:08:53] <rs> that makes a lot of sense now
[02:09:14] <xKraty> emka: it's something happen after your set_filter_date_string()
[02:09:15] <rs> would you happen to have a possible suggestion for how to correctly handle it?
[02:09:21] <becom33> I'm doing a html replace of a tag inside a loop . but the it doesnt show untill the loop ends
[02:09:26] <Cork> rs: so first use this.each(function() { /* plugin code */ })
[02:09:32] <Cork> in the initial function
[02:09:34] <emka> nope xKraty
[02:09:42] <emka> doesnt work even without that
[02:10:03] <xKraty> if you put an alert at the end of your function you ll notice that it become green after the alert
[02:10:26] <Cork> rs: secondly you need to instantiate an object for each element
[02:10:28] <rs> Cork: in the $.fn.pluginName] bit?
[02:10:39] <Sejo_> Anybody who can help me with this question?
[02:10:40] <Sejo_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-noconflict-jquery-mobile
[02:10:52] <rs> Sejo_ : one sec'
[02:10:54] <Cork> rs: hmm actually you could forward it there
[02:11:08] <Cork> rs: but then you would have to do it in line 9
[02:11:10] <becom33> anyone fore me?
[02:11:11] <Sejo_> ok, sorry :)
[02:11:25] <rs> I am calling it on separate objects
[02:11:25] <Cork> becom33: just ask the question and wait
[02:11:32] <Cork> ppl will answer if they can/have time
[02:11:48] <becom33> I'm doing a html replace of a tag inside a loop . but the it doesn't show until the loop ends
[02:11:49] <Cork> if you haven't gotten an answer in say 10 mins ask again
[02:12:10] <Sejo_> ok, good.
[02:12:30] <rs> Cork: I'm guessing you've read about/encountered this problem before
[02:12:30] <krambiorix> i want to round up numbers to 2 decimals even when it doesn't have decimals... I know about toFixed(2) but this makes a string of the variable.... How can i make a 2 decimal number?
[02:12:45] <rs> would you happen to know a good phrase to search for, so could read about it?
[02:12:47] <Cork> rs: well i've seen it before ya
[02:12:59] <Cork> rs: ppl writing plugins and missing the manual for it :)
[02:13:13] <rs> not quite following your suggested solution
[02:13:16] <Cork> rs: anyway i would remove holder all together
[02:13:29] <rs> ok
[02:13:31] <Cork> and instead pass the value as arguments to the different functions
[02:14:02] <rs> so eg: populateSelect(this) ......
[02:14:06] <rs> this.append(.....)
[02:14:10] <Cork> rs: also don't use plugin global variables unless you need it
[02:14:12] <rs> instead of $holder.append?
[02:14:19] <Cork> rs: ya
[02:14:30] <Cork> populateSelect($(this)) though
[02:14:31] <rs> didn't intentionally :) is there a better way to deal with data?
[02:14:55] <Cork> rs: depends on how you want to structure the plugin
[02:15:10] <Cork> you could create an unique object for each element
[02:15:18] <Cork> and set the functions on the prototype
[02:15:41] <Cork> then you can hold the values on the object
[02:16:16] <emka> that is probably because datepicker does something after onselect that adds the class xKraty
[02:16:27] <emka> not because of my function
[02:17:00] <rs> so something like
[02:17:03] <rs> this.data......
[02:17:12] <rs> this.data.src.
[02:17:15] <rs> this.data.url
[02:17:20] <rs> this.data.xyz?
[02:17:44] <Cork> rs: in this case you set this to the dom element
[02:17:50] <Cork> you would have to change that
[02:17:56] <rs> $(this).data() ?
[02:18:03] <Cork> that is another option ya
[02:18:15] <Cork> just remember to prefix the keys for the plugin
[02:18:19] <Cork> so you don't get name conflicts
[02:19:09] <rs> again, any good resources of this? I like to try and follow best practice in terms of layout/naming convention
[02:19:12] <Sejo1> I´m still here, just installed a IRC client. When someone has time, my question is this: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-noconflict-jquery-mobile
[02:19:57] <Cork> becom33: loops are synchronous, means nothing else can do anything with the page
[02:20:21] <Cork> becom33: you need to make it async if you want to have it update while you loop
[02:20:57] <Cork> rs: as you make a widget; you might want to have a look at "widgetFactory"
[02:21:13] <Cork> rs: it is what jquery ui uses
[02:21:28] <rs> that sounds useful - I'll take a look - ta
[02:21:30] <Cork> (and it is already in your site if you use jquery ui)
[02:22:14] <Cork> becom33: so to solve that problem you would have to replace the loop with a chained setTimeout recursion
[02:22:16] <becom33> Corey, I did
[02:22:25] <becom33> oh I see
[02:22:32] <Cork> becom33: also it helps if you share the code
[02:22:39] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is nice for that
[02:22:45] <Cork> jsbin.com is another nice option
[02:23:15] <beasty> morning Cork
[02:23:25] <Cork> o/
[02:23:53] <ph88_> hi i'm running jQuery 1.11.0 in IE8 and i get this error "Object doesn't support this property or method"   for line:   z.addEventListener?(z.removeEventListener("DOMContentLoaded"  .....
[02:24:08] <Cork> <_<
[02:24:08] <ph88_> minified version
[02:24:20] <rs> ph88_ : sure you're selecting the right object?
[02:24:25] <Cork> ph88_: are you sure you are using 1.11?
[02:24:35] <Cork> cause that should not be used in ie8
[02:24:39] <rs> ph88_ : put a debugger in and inspect the object you think you have in chrom
[02:24:41] <Cork> sounds more like 2.x
[02:24:47] <ph88_> rs: ah it can be caused by one of my scripts? ok reasonable ...
[02:24:49] <rs> Cork: think I have it working now - thanks for your help
[02:25:13] <Cork> ph88_: ie < 10 uses attachEvent
[02:25:20] <ph88_> Cork: im loading it like this   <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>   <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.min.js">\x3C/script>')</script>
[02:25:23] <Cork> and jquery should notice this
[02:25:55] <ph88_> Cork: jQuery 1.* is IE6 and up ??  http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[02:26:26] <Cork> ph88: >= 2.x is ie9+
[02:26:36] <Cork> and yes 1.x has legacy support
[02:26:45] <ph88_> rs: well chrome doesn't throw this error ... so i can't know there which "supposingly not an object" is causing the problem
[02:27:05] <Cork> ph88: but no browser.support has nothing to do with this
[02:27:23] <ph88_> Cork: yes i understand .. it can be my application code ...
[02:27:30] <ph88_> how can i trace the problem back in IE8 ?
[02:27:54] <ph88_> step out ?
[02:28:01] <Cork> heh just found this nice comment "// IE11 does not have attachEvent, so all must suffer" ;D
[02:28:09] <ph88_> lol
[02:28:35] <Cork> ph88: first use a jquery that isn't minified
[02:28:36] <ph88_> i don't know what's being passed into the jQuery lib just before jQuery errors on this .addEventListener
[02:28:41] <ph88_> ok Cork
[02:28:53] <Cork> i think this is failing for you for some reason if ( parent.addEventListener ) {
[02:29:05] <Cork> line 1074
[02:29:12] <Cork> *2
[02:30:23] <Cork> wait a min...
[02:30:25] <Cork> "z.addEventListener?("
[02:30:28] <ph88_> yes
[02:30:30] <Sejo1> How can i make jquery mobile works, with jquery noconflict mode?
[02:31:04] <Sejo1> Let jquery.mobile use, jQuery_2_1_0 for example, insted of $ or jQuery
[02:31:14] <Cork> ph88: ya, use a normal version, should make debugging much easier
[02:31:25] <ph88_> Cork:  line 3437  document.removeEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", completed, false );
[02:32:15] <Cork> ph88: is this in ie8 or a newer ie in compatibility mode?
[02:32:25] <ph88_> ie8 through browserstack.com
[02:32:30] <ph88_> win7
[02:32:37] <Cork> try in a real ie8 then
[02:32:44] <ph88_> it's a real ie8 ...
[02:32:55] <Cork> ph88: i mean local, where you know what you run
[02:33:16] <ph88_> i don't have that available :'(
[02:33:24] <Cork> casue if it crashes on line 3437
[02:33:28] <ph88_> took a subscription on browserstack to test on all platforms
[02:33:34] <Cork> it means that if(document.addEventListener) has to be passed
[02:33:45] <Cork> and that would mean document.addEventListener != undefined
[02:33:55] <Cork> meaning; what you see isn't from ie8
[02:33:58] <ph88_> i added a polyfill for addEventListener because i was using that in my own script somewhere ... but i don't have a polyfill for removeEventListener
[02:34:17] <Cork> ph88: well there you go
[02:34:21] <Cork> you broke it :)
[02:34:26] <ph88_> lol :P
[02:34:36] <ph88_> so i broke feature detection of jQuery ?
[02:34:44] <Cork> yes
[02:34:56] <Cork> cause they had to switch it to support ie11
[02:35:33] <ph88_> hhmm ok so either i get another polyfull to add support for removeEventListener or i change my code to be IE8 compatiable
[02:35:44] <Cork> ph88: ya
[02:35:49] <ph88_> i think i do the latter because it's only on one line that i used addEventListener ^^
[02:35:52] <ph88_> thx Cork very smart
[02:41:32] <ph88_> "Internet explorer stopped working, windows is looking for a solution for the problem" :P
[02:41:46] <ph88_> i have a solution for them "make new browser"
[02:43:28] <Cork> heh
[02:43:33] <Cork> ph88: well they did
[02:43:40] <Cork> it's called ie10
[02:43:46] <Cork> they really fixed a lot of things there
[02:43:54] <Cork> though events are still a bit messed up
[02:43:59] <ph88_> my website doesn't work on ie10, but it does work on ie11
[02:44:31] <Cork> the site i'm currently a big ie11 problem, (not in production) that i need to trace down
[02:44:47] <Cork> ie11 falls into an infinite submit loop when the form is loaded
[02:44:55] <Cork> the thing is... there is no submit code in js
[02:45:05] <Cork> so it is something about the dom structure that tripps ie...
[02:45:15] <Cork> scary as hell
[02:45:23] <ph88_> yes
[02:45:43] <ph88_> Cork: do you work for someone ?
[02:45:48] <Cork> need to put a day off for it sometime in the future
[02:45:53] <Cork> ph88: ya
[02:46:25] <ph88_> and you have other people for server side code ?
[02:46:30] <Cork> no
[02:46:36] <ph88_> oh ^^
[02:46:45] <ph88_> what do you program server side? php ?
[02:46:53] <Cork> i write every thing from c, go, puthin, ruby (rails) to css + html
[02:47:03] <ph88_> very nice Cork
[02:47:03] <Cork> we have some too
[02:47:07] <Cork> but mostly not
[02:47:18] <ph88_> puthin ? russion version of python ?
[02:47:24] <ph88_> ;)
[02:47:27] <Cork> heh
[02:47:44] <Cork> most is in rails when it doesn't need preformance (if it needs html)
[02:48:06] <Cork> ruby if it doesn't need performance and no html
[02:48:08] <ph88_> freelance then ?
[02:48:10] <Cork> and go if speed is needed
[02:48:20] <Cork> no i write for what the company needs
[02:48:27] <ph88_> not really getting go yet ... i think it's pretty new too
[02:48:41] <Cork> it has been around for a few years
[02:48:50] <Cork> i tinker with rust at home
[02:48:53] <Cork> :)
[02:49:04] <Cork> ya, i know i'm a language nerd ^^'
[02:49:07] <ph88_> lol
[02:49:12] <ph88_> what do you think about D ?
[02:49:20] <Cork> never seen a need for it
[02:49:30] <Cork> c (and sometimes c++) was good enough
[02:49:34] <ph88_> some claim it's superior to C++
[02:49:46] <ph88_> but then other say it's too complex and has too many language keywords
[02:49:46] <Cork> i would prob rather go objectC then d
[02:49:49] <ph88_> so then rust is better
[02:49:57] <ph88_> but rust is very very new so it's not clear what it will become
[02:50:01] <Cork> it is memory safe
[02:50:13] <Cork> it guarantees to not have use after free
[02:50:17] <ph88_> i thought ObjectC was only for apple ^^
[02:50:35] <Cork> ph88: it isn't
[02:50:43] <Cork> apple uses it the most
[02:50:50] <Cork> but you can use it in other systems
[02:50:57] <Cork> but ya, i haven't used it much
[02:52:35] <ph88_> i think web developing will be more fun in the future
[02:52:47] <ph88_> less compatiblity issues and more cool stuff for rad
[02:52:55] <Cork> ya
[02:53:07] <Cork> it is already getting much better as old ie's drop of
[02:53:21] <Cork> and as js gets more and more low level
[02:53:23] <ph88_> but ie8-10 have a long time till end of life
[02:53:28] <Cork> the speed is getting nicer and nicer
[02:53:35] <ph88_> and mostly if you work for business they don't upgrade their systems
[02:53:55] * OnkelTem has a feeling that he joint someone's private chat occasionally
[02:54:04] <Cork> ph88: ie pre 9 is mostly dead in a few weeks
[02:54:16] <Cork> when xp dies the last os that can't go above 8 is gone
[02:54:19] <ph88_> don't think Cork like private chat so i keep it here :P
[02:54:30] <ph88_> Cork: few weeks ?
[02:54:42] <ph88_> Cork: that's not true ... actually windows 7 can support IE8 !!!!
[02:54:58] <Cork> ph88: but then you need to install it manually
[02:55:05] <Cork> it ships with ie9
[02:55:13] <Cork> and xp can't get above ie8
[02:55:19] <Cork> so there was a big blocker there
[02:55:30] <beasty> mm pondering if i do a show() on a element if there is a event triggerd ?
[02:55:32] <ph88_> Cork: are you very very sure? my sys admin here says that in the very first versions of win7 it was shipped with ie8
[02:55:43] <Cork> beasty: there isn't
[02:55:52] <beasty> hmm
[02:56:00] <beasty> then i'll have to extend $.fn.show ?
[02:56:08] <ph88_> beasty: what would you like to do ?
[02:56:12] <Cork> ph88: possibly an rc might have had ie8
[02:56:24] <Cork> ph88: but the dvd has ie9 on it
[02:56:42] <Cork> beasty: most likely ya
[02:56:46] <beasty> oh ok
[02:56:48] <ph88_> Cork: i belief you over my sysadmin tbh :P
[02:56:51] <Cork> beasty: that is fairly easy to do though
[02:57:19] <Cork> ph88: but actually i care more about the min versions then the max versions
[02:57:26] <beasty> Cork: yeah i think so to :)
[02:57:33] <Cork> xp can't install ie9 how ever much you want to
[02:57:46] <ph88_> yup
[02:57:52] <Cork> ph88: while vista and win7 supports ie11
[02:58:01] <ph88_> have you read that article of windows improving compatibility mode ?
[02:58:10] <Cork> don't care
[02:58:10] <beasty> i use 'sauce' for ie emulation
[02:58:28] <fRAiLtY-> With ajax, how can I pass so in Firebug under Parameters I see cms_handler in bold and upload_onUpload as the "value"
[02:58:47] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what?
[02:58:48] <beasty> https://saucelabs.com
[02:58:51] <beasty> pretty handy
[02:58:55] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: context please :)
[02:59:07] <ph88_> Cork: damn i cant find the article now ... but that would be if companies rely on old browser versions for some apps ... then they no longer have to and can just upgrade :)
[02:59:34] <Cork> ph88: ya, they have been working on that for a while
[02:59:59] <ph88_> yes then it's bye bye compatiblity problems 8)
[03:00:06] <Cork> i just wish all specific browser vendor sites could die
[03:00:18] <Cork> (including ios mobile sites)
[03:00:27] <seutje> especially*
[03:01:02] <seutje> so annoying they block pushState calls when not a direct result of a user action :(
[03:01:07] <seutje> or rather, make it fail silently
[03:01:52] <Cork> seutje: who does?
[03:02:05] <seutje> iOS safari
[03:02:08] <basiclaser> how would you guys make a slider that a user can drag, with a window display the time of the day? left end is 00:00, right end is 23:59
[03:02:08] <Cork> ouch
[03:02:17] <basiclaser> is there a library for that?
[03:02:17] <Cork> seutje: that would break my site quite badly...
[03:02:25] <seutje> note: ajax success is not a direct user action
[03:02:32] <Cork> ya i know
[03:02:45] <seutje> so yeah q.q
[03:02:52] <Cork> oh well they will have to have wrong urls then
[03:02:57] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Sorry, http://cl.ly/image/442D1A3e043K is what I'm trying to achieve in an AJAX post, tried this but it breaks the ajax request data: {cms_handler_name:'upload:on_Upload'},
[03:03:13] <Sejo1> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-noconflict-jquery-mobile ?
[03:03:15] <Cork> ah the params
[03:03:42] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: why does it break?
[03:03:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: cause that is exactly what i would try
[03:04:07] <seutje> Cork: spent over a full day last week implementing a workaround cause the client considered it to be critical :(
[03:04:16] <Cork> Sejo1: don't use mobile sorry
[03:04:26] <Cork> seutje: how?
[03:04:29] <fRAiLtY-> Well, in Firebug if I take out the data line, it successfully does a post request, however with that line in Firebug shows nothing, no errors either, just nothing
[03:04:38] <Cork> in my site the calling script doesn't even know the resulting url...
[03:04:44] <Cork> (redirects)
[03:04:46] <seutje> Cork: basically, on iOS, I pushState before doing the ajax call
[03:05:17] <nicolas_FR> hi there
[03:05:25] <seutje> in theory, it could result to some confusing shit, but I don't care, the client stopped complaining
[03:05:26] <Cork> guess ios will have to use hash bang then
[03:05:57] <seutje> that was one option, but the app in question already has issues with the hash fallback system
[03:06:11] <Cork> ya...
[03:06:18] <nicolas_FR> Object #<Object> has no method 'valid' problem. If I click again the valid() button then it works. But first call seems to be a problem. I don't know why
[03:06:24] <Cork> man this is confusing me to no end
[03:06:26] <seutje> the problem was mainly detecting it without going straight for UA sniffing
[03:06:33] <Cork> why would apple add a restriction like that
[03:06:44] <seutje> "security"
[03:07:04] <Cork> seutje: if they can't change anything other then for the current domain
[03:07:09] <Cork> i don't really see the problem
[03:07:14] <seutje> me neither
[03:07:21] <seutje> same with the video not autoplaying
[03:07:31] <Cork> i mean nothing prevents the server from doing it through redirects anyway
[03:07:34] <seutje> cause "it could have the user downloading a lot without knowing"
[03:07:53] <seutje> but meanwhile you can download terrabytes of images in the background without any restrictions
[03:07:53] <Cork> ...
[03:08:14] <Cork> i know safari was broken, but...
[03:08:21] <seutje> standards are so 1999 anyway :P
[03:09:27] <seutje> there's  a workaround for the video thing though, "just wrap it in an iframe" © - Remy Sharp
[03:11:35] <becom33> guys they have remove panel slide effect from 1.4 1 . Im not sure how can I add the slide effect to the jquery mobile panel . help
[03:14:36] <nicolas_FR> validation with additionnal-method (including custom) problem here... I have a custom phone number validation method in my additionnal-methods.js file. First time I load the page, if I begin the enter something in the phone field, an exception occurs : Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'valid'. If I finish filling the field and call the valid() method, all is ok
[03:16:12] <Cork> seutje: btw is this on mobile/tablet or desktop too?
[03:26:36] <becom33> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/panel-swipe-open/#demo-page doesnt have the push slide effect
[03:26:39] <becom33> how can I add it
[03:32:28] <geek_> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/panel-swipe-open/#demo-page doesnt have the push slide effect . how can I add it
[03:39:02] <nicolas_FR> geek_ / becom33 : what is the question ?
[03:39:22] <geek_> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/panel-swipe-open/#demo-page doesnt have the push slide effect . how can I add it ?
[03:39:38] <nicolas_FR> geek_: what is the push slide effect ?
[03:40:44] <geek_> nicolas_FR like in facebook app . they have smooth slide effect
[03:41:07] <geek_> jquery mobile had it in last version . but it doesnt work
[03:41:10] <bigbugjava> Hi there guys, I need a recommened Jquery/Javascript advertisement banner/slider, it's for a wedding site.. the advertisement is sites that help people who get married, ideas? thanks
[03:41:36] <nicolas_FR> geek_: well the page you link has a slide the the side effect, opening a left or right zone with text... no ?
[03:42:02] <geek_> umm nicolas_FR no it doesnt :/
[03:42:21] <geek_> even im my mobile it doest has the effect . it just open from the left
[03:42:24] <nicolas_FR> geek_: well, on my firefox it's working
[03:42:32] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone suggest why this function won't post params? http://pastie.org/8881781#17
[03:42:39] <fRAiLtY-> Post shown below
[03:42:42] <geek_> nicolas_FR, try on chrome
[03:42:47] <fRAiLtY-> data: {} doesn't work at all
[03:42:56] <fabioportieri> i heard animations in mobile are a bitch
[03:43:20] <nicolas_FR> geek_: swiping to left or right : smoothy sliding etc. working
[03:44:37] <geek_> nicolas_FR, what the devil . on firefox it works . on chrome it doesnt . not in my mobile ither
[03:45:43] <nicolas_FR> geek_: check your chrome version etc. It's working on my chrome / firefox (and I bet IE and opera too).
[03:46:11] <Naeblis> How would I add a file to the form data sent along via $.post ?
[03:46:13] <nicolas_FR> geek_: or maybe you deactivated js on chrome ?
[03:47:03] <geek_> nop
[03:47:19] <nicolas_FR> geek_: right : on opera no smooth animation
[03:47:34] <Cork> Naeblis: you would have to use the formData object
[03:47:38] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[03:47:41] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[03:47:50] <nicolas_FR> you should maybe check : http://caniuse.com/
[03:48:01] <Cork> Naeblis: and then you would have to use it instead to hold the data you want to send
[03:48:01] <Naeblis> Cork: ok, thanks
[03:48:14] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Can you suggest why this function won't post params? http://pastie.org/8881781#17
[03:48:21] <Cork> Naeblis: you also need to tell ajax not to try to parse the data it gets
[03:48:36] <Naeblis> Cork: how would I do that?
[03:49:28] <Cork> Naeblis: firstly you need to use $.ajax instead of $.post
[03:49:47] <Cork> Naeblis: and then you need to set the options processData and contentType to false;
[03:50:21] <Naeblis> ok...
[03:50:25] <Cork> { processData: false, contentTyp: false, data: new FormData() }
[03:50:30] <Cork> opps
[03:50:44] <Cork> { type: 'post', processData: false, contentTyp: false, data: new FormData() }
[03:51:06] <Cork> Naeblis: the reason for these hoops is cause normal ajax can't send files
[03:51:22] <Cork> Naeblis: also note that older ie doesn't support formData
[03:51:38] <Naeblis> Cork: data: new FormData() will automatically send the entire form data (along with the file) ?
[03:51:51] <Cork> Naeblis: you need to add the data to it
[03:51:55] <Naeblis> I don't have to add it manually to the new instance or somethign?
[03:51:56] <Naeblis> yeah
[03:52:18] <Cork> var formdata = new FormData($(form)[0]); will add the form fields
[03:52:21] <ekcktroij> Hi, I use jquery's load() to load a bunch of html fragments... by classname like $(".class").load("test.html", function() {}); - But I need to execute some code after ALL fragrments are loaded
[03:52:28] <ekcktroij> how would I do that?
[03:52:36] <Cork> and then you need to add the files with .append
[03:52:41] <Naeblis> Cork: sweet
[03:52:45] <Naeblis> thanks so much
[03:52:47] <Cork> np
[03:53:13] <Cork> Naeblis: also input_file.files holds the files of the input
[03:53:30] <Cork> where input_file is the dom element of the input type="file" element
[03:53:43] <Naeblis> indeed
[03:53:51] <Naeblis> I have var in_file = $('#id_in_file').files[0];
[03:53:58] <Naeblis> should work?
[03:54:03] <Cork> ekcktroij: $.when($().load()).done() should work
[03:54:10] <Cork> yes
[03:54:23] <Cork> just append it to the FormData element with a key name
[03:56:17] <ekcktroij> tx
[03:56:33] <ekcktroij> tx
[03:57:09] <Naeblis> Cork: ok one last thing
[03:57:23] <Naeblis> the data being returned by POST is a big <svg>...</svg>
[03:57:57] <Naeblis> any particular thing I need to keep in mind to handle that?
[03:58:02] <Naeblis> I think I'll have to do dataType: html
[03:58:26] <Naeblis> (my use case is to submit the form and render the SVG on the same page)
[04:02:43] <Cork> Naeblis: dataType is for what to "accept" from the server
[04:02:44] <ekcktroij> I put my event handlers in that done() method, but they just don't get added for some reason
[04:02:57] <Cork> Naeblis: and no the browser will make the content as it needs
[04:03:45] <ekcktroij> it goes in the done function, but my event handlers arennt applied
[04:04:02] <ekcktroij> don't get it
[04:06:10] <shoky> .load() doesn't return a jqXHR
[04:06:30] <shoky> so you can't pass it to $.when
[04:07:04] <Cork> shoky: you can, but i don't remember the property you need to use
[04:07:09] <Cork> was looking for it right now
[04:07:19] <Cork> but i can't continue i need to take something
[04:07:25] <shoky> a property on the jquery obj?
[04:07:29] <Cork> yes
[04:07:36] <Cork> you can get a deferred object
[04:07:45] <shoky> hm
[04:29:01] <krambiorix> i add props to my object like foo['bar'] = 'bar'... When i check if the object has properties with foo.isEmptyObject  , i get .isEmptyObject is not a function
[04:30:09] <Cork> ?api jquery.isEmptyObject
[04:30:09] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.isEmptyObject(): Check to see if an object is empty (contains no properties). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/
[04:30:20] <Cork> meaning $.isEmptyObject(foo)
[04:30:39] <krambiorix> ow
[04:31:27] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[04:35:30] <seutje> Cork: only iOS safari afaik
[04:35:34] <seutje> s/afaik/I hope
[04:35:38] <Cork> :)
[04:35:39] <Cork> thx
[04:35:54] <seutje> haven't gotten desktop safari specific issues in a while
[04:40:29] <lng> how can I change a title attribute of <div id="dialog" title="Expiry">?
[04:41:17] <Cork> lng: for a jquery ui dialog?
[04:41:50] <lng> yea
[04:42:03] <lng> something like this? $( "#greatphoto" ).attr( "alt", "Beijing Brush Seller" );
[04:42:08] <Cork> $().dialog('option', 'title'; '')
[04:42:15] <Cork> opps
[04:42:19] <Cork> * $().dialog('option', 'title', '')
[04:42:51] <Cork> lng: also alt isn't title
[04:42:57] <Cork> alt is only for images
[04:43:09] <lng> it was an example
[04:43:12] <Cork> and is a content replacement
[04:43:29] <Cork> lng: .dialog() only reads the title tag as it creates the dialog
[04:43:38] <Cork> s/tag/attribute/
[04:43:47] <lng> I need it to be dynamic
[04:44:10] <Cork> *see earlier response*
[04:44:56] <lng> ok, thanks
[04:54:51] <cprodigy29> just wondering why would my json request work fine in Safari but give me a XMLHttpRequest cannot load in Chrome?
[04:54:55] <lng> This is how I get the first cell value: $(self).closest('tr').children().first().text(); but how do get a vlue say the third or fifth cell?
[04:55:59] <shoky> `api eq
[04:55:59] <b-ot> shoky: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[04:57:54] <lng> shoky: tnx
[05:12:41] <Naeblis> I make an ajax request to render an SVG. It works fine, but after the request, when I use the back button, I get all the POST data in my address bar as query parameters. This includes the csrf token.
[05:12:42] <Naeblis> :(
[05:46:52] <ReBa1> Anyone able to help me with following question? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22225310/google-maps-touch-scroll-not-working-on-windows-phone?noredirect=1#comment33747007_22225310

[06:03:12] <xKraty> yes you can
[06:03:25] <Obama> Yes you can!
[06:03:35] <decx> would probably be better to do that directly on your data before you put it back in the dom
[06:04:21] <pu239> decx: thanks, i'll give it a try
[06:05:13] <xKraty> decx shouldn't be able to it like that aswell? variable_with_html.each(function() ...
[06:05:22] <xKraty> s/to/to do/
[06:05:27] <decx> depending on how it's set up $(mydata).find(':input').each
[06:06:13] <decx> impossible to say without knowing what's in variable_with_html ^^

[06:08:22] <decx> yes
[06:08:23] <decx> indeed
[06:08:48] <xKraty> i guess i'll try to win the next M@sterChef lol
[06:08:56] <xKraty> so i can eat as much as i want
[06:09:04] <xKraty> and become 13324234239023490324234 kg
[06:09:47] <decx> i cant eat much
[06:10:24] <decx> also sometimes i forget to eat
[06:10:36] <decx> "ooops it's getting dark, should get some breakfast"
[06:10:42] <xKraty> do someone know a plugin for make interactive wizard
[06:10:48] <clime> Hey, what is the definition of render-blocking javascript?
[06:10:50] <xKraty> like --> "here you can get pancakes"
[06:11:01] <xKraty> <-- "here you can sit and eat"
[06:11:03] <decx> it's javascript that's blocking rendering
[06:12:19] <tarjquery> Hi. After stepping through jquery-2.1.0.js, I'm having trouble seeing how line 6462 is supposed to work:
[06:12:26] <tarjquery> remaining = Math.max( 0, animation.startTime + animation.duration - currentTime )
[06:12:42] <tarjquery> The line tries to calculate the remaining number of milliseconds for an Animation object, and, since startTime and currentTime are Date objects, relies on implicit calls to Date.valueOf before the interpreter attempts arithmetic operations. What happens, for me, though, is that the plus operator results in string concatenation, and that “remaining” is assigned the value of NaN.
[06:12:56] <tarjquery> This is also the behavior you get when evaluating date1 + integer - date2 in a pristine console in Chrome or Firefox. What would work is date1 - date2 + integer, due to left-to-right evaluation.
[06:14:15] <tarjquery> This should affect just about all animation in jQuery, so how is anyone else getting this to work?
[06:14:48] <decx> by ditching .animation once we found out about css transitions
[06:14:57] <clime> decx: what kind of javascript blocks renderring?
[06:15:36] <decx> every kind
[06:17:58] <clime> decx: thank you for your great knowledge!
[06:18:36] <tarjquery> decx: Ok, so I should just forget about using newer jQuery versions for code that in any way invokes "effects"-related parts of the library?
[06:19:13] <fabioportieri> tarjquery: you should file a bug for that, i think
[06:19:15] <decx> clime check out asynchronous loading, it will still be blocking, but just after everything else is loaded
[06:20:02] <decx> tarjquery sorry i haven'T used animate extensively in a while and couldn'T say what's the root of your problem
[06:20:34] <decx> these damn big Ts, i have a sticky shift key
[06:21:34] <basiclaser> HEY GUYS whats up with this iframe? #
[06:21:38] <basiclaser> http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/s39U9/
[06:21:41] <basiclaser> you love my questions
[06:22:10] <tarjquery> But are you saying nobody's using things like fadeIn/fadeOut, or hide/show with a delay argument, anymore?
[06:22:10] <Cork> basiclaser: what about it?
[06:22:20] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: That question is terrible.
[06:22:23] <Cork> tarjquery: what is the problem?
[06:22:26] <decx> getelementbyid('.backgroundvideo') really?
[06:22:35] <Cork> lol
[06:22:37] <shoky> tarjquery: they're not Date objects
[06:22:41] <decx> you've been here more than 3 seconds, come on
[06:22:57] <tarjquery> shoky: Oh?
[06:23:01] <Cork> basiclaser: you most likely want document.querySelector
[06:23:09] <wilornel> Hey guys! My autocomplete widget is writing down the autocompletion terms in a list after the input. The elements are not in a drop down
[06:23:16] <shoky> tarjquery: they're timestamps. numbers
[06:23:40] <BillCriswell> I just ate like 60 grapes. I hope that's not unhealthy.
[06:23:46] <Cork> basiclaser: also you use " in side a " string
[06:23:54] <shoky> sounds healthy to me
[06:24:18] <decx> isnt that the normal count on a stick you buy
[06:24:25] <decx> who doesnt go through the whole thing
[06:24:32] <BillCriswell> decx: I have no idea.
[06:24:55] <BillCriswell> I got them at the asian corner store. I didn't have to pick them off or nothin.
[06:25:09] <BillCriswell> They were just in a plastic bag.
[06:25:23] <decx> already separated grapes? living the high live i see
[06:25:36] <decx> or maybe those were just the ones that fell off ^^
[06:25:59] <basiclaser> some poor blind child with no knees had to pick those for you. you should feel bad
[06:26:04] <shoky> tarjquery: i'm guessing your "duration" option is bad
[06:26:13] <BillCriswell> I was going to find a servant to feed them to me but I just can't get into that.
[06:26:30] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Sounds like he's wobble around, a lot.
[06:26:30] <decx> i found some nuts under a bridge
[06:26:33] <BillCriswell> he'd*
[06:26:34] <decx> good protein
[06:26:48] <basiclaser> hhahaaha
[06:27:06] <BillCriswell> decx: With Duncan?
[06:27:11] <decx> indeed
[06:27:42] <tarjquery> shoky: Thanks, you made me realize something here. DateJS doesn't mix very well with jQuery, due to the fact that it overrides Date.now
[06:27:48] <wilornel> So, does anybody know why jquery Ui is printing the possibilities in a list under the input box?
[06:28:09] <BillCriswell> wilornel: It sounds like you're missing some CSS.
[06:28:11] <tarjquery> And jQuery.now is initialized as Date.now
[06:28:13] <decx> not without an example of your implementation, it doesnt normally do that
[06:28:40] <shoky> why the hell would they override Date.now :\
[06:28:54] <tarjquery> Well, I'm kicking that library out.
[06:29:00] <tarjquery> DateJS, that is.
[06:29:01] <BillCriswell> That sounds dangerous and lame.
[06:29:10] <BillCriswell> moment.js is the only one I've used.
[06:29:19] <wilornel> BillCriswell: Seems plausible!
[06:29:34] <tarjquery> Thanks, I'll check out moment.js
[06:37:25] <BillCriswell> I have three sections of HTML that are essentially displaying the same thing, all using different HTML.
[06:39:11] <decx> sounds like the start of a marvelous adventure
[06:40:36] <geek_> om jquery mobile I want to do a http request after the page loaded completely . so I used "pageshow" event . but the page loads after the http request . how can I sent this request after the page loads complely
[06:40:38] <geek_> >
[06:40:39] <geek_> ?
[06:40:41] <BillCriswell> It's so frustrating I don't even want to do it.
[06:56:02] <BillCriswell> I love how quiet it gets in here after a jQuery Mobile question.
[06:57:26] <wilornel> BillCriswell: +1!
[06:57:32] <plepzz> #jquerymobile
[06:57:47] <plepzz> whos
[06:57:50] <plepzz> +p
[06:58:29] <drej> *crickets*
[06:58:43] <Woet> using data tables with sAjaxSource how do I pass other fields to the AJAX?
[06:58:43] <drej> jquery mobile is like the drunk uncle that noone likes to talk about
[06:58:50] <Woet> I want to send fields to the ajax request
[07:00:12] <farn5w0rth> Woet: i think its better if you make your ajax request and within the success handler to define your variables and then use those in the dataTables - that served to be easier for when i did that
[07:00:19] <Kingsy> if I have a variable which is declared outside of an each() loop.. and I update that variable inside the each. how can I ensure it remains updated on the next iteration of the loop ?
[07:00:21] <Woet> errm
[07:00:25] <Woet> i want to pass data to the ajax request
[07:00:26] <Woet> so i know what to return
[07:00:43] <Cork> Kingsy: just don't define it inside the loop
[07:01:05] <Cork> var a = 1; $.each(arr, function() { a++; })
[07:01:16] <Cork> (silly way to do a length check? :D )
[07:02:38] <Woet> farn5w0rth: https://datatables.net/usage/server-side - i want to add a parameter to be sent to the server
[07:03:30] <Cork> Woet: the fnServerData option?
[07:03:30] <Kingsy> hmm I am doing that afaik, perhaps not
[07:03:32] <farn5w0rth> Woet: ah i see, yep i went the dom way
[07:03:41] <Cork> Kingsy: code?
[07:03:43] <Woet> Cork: yea, i think i got it to work with fnServerParams
[07:11:16] <juno-es> hello, someone know of some jquery plugin that you can to apper dinamic contente in a html page?
[07:11:55] <farn5w0rth> juno-es: apper?
[07:12:17] <juno-es> like this page: http://www.maianscriptworld.com/demos/music/admin/index.php?p=add
[07:13:03] <juno-es> sorry farn5w0rh, i mean "appear"
[07:15:10] <juno-es> you choose a number in a dropdown select, and then a html is repeated the same number of times
[07:15:32] <zumba_addict> off topic question :) do you guys know of a free blog site that I can sign up so I can share some things I've learning in programming?
[07:17:25] <jphase> zumba_addict: wordpress.com ?
[07:17:33] <Cork> zumba_addict: wordpress, or just github, blogger.com
[07:17:42] <Cork> there are plenty
[07:17:49] <zumba_addict> ah, I have github. Ididn't know we can create blog
[07:18:00] <jphase> well you can create "gists"
[07:18:05] <zumba_addict> k

[07:18:35] <Cork> *gists
[07:18:36] <zumba_addict> searching for gists so I can see if it can be made to look nice
[07:18:40] <Cork> you can create pages
[07:18:49] <Cork> http://pages.github.com/
[07:18:49] <zumba_addict> oh cool
[07:19:08] <zumba_addict> pretty neat and very nice
[07:19:48] <soahccc> I hope github isn't going to get acquired in the next years

[07:25:17] <xKraty> isn't that insane?

[08:00:38] <farn5w0rth> anyone else have issues getting dataTables extension TableTools to work in a modal?
[08:05:49] <jop008> I have a long select list with many items is it possible to navigate to an item by clicking the first letter of an item?
[08:06:58] <farn5w0rth> jop008: use chosen http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[08:07:03] <BillCriswell> jop008: You mean like have A..Z in the select at the top and have clicking that take you to the first real item for the letter you click?
[08:07:26] <jop008> yes that's my specs
[08:07:34] <BillCriswell> jop008: I agree with farn5w0rth, chosen would make this much easier.
[08:07:36] <jop008> To make it the user easier
[08:07:51] <jop008> chosen?
[08:08:05] <BillCriswell> Yes, http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[08:08:43] <BillCriswell> jop008: A select would automatically jump to the first of a given letter when it's open up and someone types anyway though.
[08:10:18] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/kucuzozo/1/edit?html,output click the select, press "b" on the keyboard and it jumps to it.
[08:12:45] <jop008> chosen doesn't work on ipad iphone
[08:12:59] <jop008> and there the list is also long
[08:14:10] <diegoviola> hi
[08:15:10] <BillCriswell> jop008: Fair point.
[08:15:56] <BillCriswell> I feel like maybe auto complete might be a better approach than a select then.
[08:16:56] <diegoviola> i'm trying to use this lib here: https://github.com/snikch/jquery.dirtyforms but i can't get it to work: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/9393221
[08:16:59] <diegoviola> if i remove the line 2 it works
[08:17:00] <jop008> So there is no solution on mobile devices
[08:17:05] <diegoviola> any ideas how i can get around this?
[08:17:16] <jop008> Is there one avail in Xcode itself?
[08:18:08] <BillCriswell> In xcode?
[08:18:23] <jop008> apple developmetn tools
[08:18:48] <jphase> there's no chosen in xcode no
[08:19:08] <jphase> some folks use jquery ui as a failover on mobile though jop008
[08:19:42] <BillCriswell> Didn't know you could use xcode for webapps?
[08:20:26] <jop008> yes you can with a wrapper around
[08:20:41] <diegoviola> any ideas
[08:23:32] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/kucuzozo/3/edit?js Is this what you were going for?
[08:28:26] <diegoviola> how do i check if a div with a specific id exists?
[08:28:56] <BillCriswell> diegoviola: Check the length on what jQuery returns.
[08:28:57] <drej> $('#specificid').length
[08:29:05] <saml> hello
[08:29:08] <saml> i wanna make friends
[08:29:16] <drej> saml you came to the wrong neighbourhood
[08:29:42] <saml> but first, $('.topstories')   how can I make sure all elements under them who has style="display: none;"   shown?
[08:30:00] <diegoviola> ty
[08:30:05] <saml> yo'ure welcome
[08:30:21] <saml> :hidden selector whoa
[08:30:46] <BillCriswell> saml: $('.topstories *').show(); might be quicker... since you won't need to test if they're hidden first
[08:32:08] <saml> $('ul.topStories li:hidden').each(function() { $(this).show(); })       vs.    $('ul.topStories *').show()
[08:32:18] <saml> .topstories *  is a huge array
[08:32:41] <BillCriswell> saml: You didn't specify li before.
[08:32:49] <saml> yah my abd
[08:32:52] <BillCriswell> $('.topstores li').show() would be much faster.
[08:33:00] <saml> yup
[08:33:28] <BillCriswell> Also, $('.topstories li:hidden').show() would essentially be the same as your first example as well. The each isn't needed.
[08:34:09] <saml> ah i see
[08:34:16] <saml> so after .show() things look bad
[08:34:25] <saml> do i need to layout again?
[08:34:35] <saml> redraw or reapply css
[08:34:54] <BillCriswell> saml: You should not need to do anything like that at all.
[08:35:08] <BillCriswell> Are you changing the classnames or id on the element or something weird?
[08:35:40] <saml> server outputs  display="style: none;"
[08:36:02] <BillCriswell> saml: That's just... broke.
[08:36:18] <decx> lol that's beautiful
[08:36:39] <BillCriswell> saml: They totally meant style="display: none;"
[08:37:48] <saml> hahaha yah style="display: none
[08:38:12] <jop008> So for a long list on ipad there is no solution like chosen?
[08:38:34] <saml> let me dig further.. looks like a few pixel is off making paragraphs pushed down the thumbnails
[08:40:02] <BillCriswell> jop008: I think autocomplete would be on par with using chosen on a long list.
[08:42:56] <zatan> hey I have got this line  $('#price-'+ prod_id).html("<img src="+ ajax_bar +">")  and I want to delay for 5 seconds and after that display $('#price-'+ prod_id).html("112")
[08:42:59] <BillCriswell> jop008: Just tried the demo here on the iphone and it worked: http://davidwalsh.name/demo/jquery-chosen.php
[08:43:57] <BillCriswell> zatan: setTimeout(function(){ /* Will wait for 5 seconds */ }, 5000);
[08:44:41] <farn5w0rth> i can't get my tableTools extension for dataTables to export my table to excel/csv/pdf in a modal https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8ed799279e84ef617444
[08:45:18] <jop008> Autocomplete? How does this work?
[08:45:39] <BillCriswell> That's just using chosen.
[08:46:06] <jop008> found
[08:46:28] <jop008> So chosen is the same as autocompete?
[08:47:17] <BillCriswell> No.
[08:47:59] <BillCriswell> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ is autocomplete, what chosen does is more along the lines of a combobox.
[08:48:05] <BillCriswell> They're similarish.
[08:50:46] <diegoviola> http://jsfiddle.net/LTKXX/2/
[08:50:48] <diegoviola> why is this not working?
[08:50:50] <diegoviola> :(
[08:51:04] <saml> works for me
[08:51:10] <saml> what it supposed to be?
[08:51:14] <NoiseEee> what about it isnt working?
[08:51:29] <NoiseEee> also wtf is 'dirtyforms'
[08:51:41] <diegoviola> .dirtyForms() should give me a warning if the form is not empty
[08:51:45] <diegoviola> the input
[08:51:55] <saml> https://github.com/snikch/jquery.dirtyforms
[08:51:57] <NoiseEee> well you haven't included whatever script "dirtyForms()" belongs to
[08:52:12] <jop008> autocomplete is fine for the desktop on an ipad/phone you don't have a mobile feeling (my site is based on jquery mobile
[08:52:33] <diegoviola> NoiseEee: yes the script is included

[08:53:18] <NoiseEee> perhaps you're not using dirtyforms correctly diegoviola
[08:53:40] <NoiseEee> seems like a ridiculous long script to be some kind of validator
[08:54:05] <Bloomberg> with doesn 't works the values selection inside the data array in the i and else if conditions?
[08:54:19] <jop008> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html this can be helpful but only after 3 characters
[08:54:40] <Bloomberg> I don't found the issue
[08:54:55] <BillCriswell> jop008: That's adjustable.
[08:56:34] <jop008> okay looking at the code I can find where this is adjustable
[08:56:35] <jop008> <ul id="autocomplete" data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="Find a city..." data-filter-theme="d"></ul> this is the code
[08:57:13] <jop008> found 	if ( value && value.length > 2 ) {
[08:57:26] <BillCriswell> Yup.
[08:57:32] <jop008> so I must transfrom my long selects in listviews
[08:58:04] <jop008> But how to handle multiple options selected?
[09:16:34] <jop008> Any idea how to change this example http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html in one where user can choose 1 then the one clicked is put above and user can start searching the next item
[09:26:21] <digifiv5e_> not sure if this is the best chan, but has anyone used moment.js? I'm trying to figure out if passing a single number for month (jan=1, feb=2) translates to (jan=0, feb=1 within moment)
[09:27:01] <duch_kazatel> digifiv5e_ have a use case?f
[09:27:26] <duch_kazatel> like are you doing something like moment("12-25-1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
[09:27:34] <digifiv5e_> moment({month:1}).format('MMM')
[09:28:06] <digifiv5e_> that returns feb, when i expected jan
[09:28:13] <duch_kazatel> hrm
[09:28:16] <duch_kazatel> let me look
[09:28:28] <BillCriswell> Then it's zero indexed like javascript.
[09:28:32] <NoiseEee> ^
[09:28:34] <duch_kazatel> ah, http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/array/
[09:28:50] <duch_kazatel> docs say it matches the Date() object.
[09:29:09] <duch_kazatel> (I linked to the array syntax but i'll bet the object syntax is largely the same)
[09:29:17] <digifiv5e_> it's fine if it's 0-11, i can adjust; just wanted to confirm it was in fact done that away
[09:29:25] <duch_kazatel> looks like it.
[09:29:40] <digifiv5e_> yes, i see moment([2010, 6]); // July 1st
[09:30:00] <digifiv5e_> th
[09:30:01] <digifiv5e_> thx
[09:30:52] <dmchale92> What's a good way to set json data as a variable after retrieving a json file?
[09:31:13] <duch_kazatel> var yourData = response;
[09:31:24] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 without more context, that's what you'd do...
[09:32:24] <dmchale92> I have a python file outputting a very simple json data array of count:(# of images counted)
[09:32:26] <dmchale92> http://pastebin.com/xyz96Kk3
[09:32:40] <dmchale92> That code returns the number that I need to set as a variable
[09:32:50] <duch_kazatel> var myNumber = json.count;
[09:33:06] <dmchale92> Thank you! Haven't worked with JSON very much yet.
[09:33:13] <duch_kazatel> unless what you're really asking is how you make that number globally available or usable outside of that callback.
[09:33:24] <dmchale92> Yeah I need it as a global variable.
[09:33:29] <dmchale92> Sorry that wasn't clear.
[09:33:55] <duch_kazatel> JSON is basically a normal javascript object btw.  you interact with it like any other object.
[09:34:39] <duch_kazatel> if you want to make that globally accessible, declare a variable up it the highest shared scope you need.  something like var theCount; up at the top.  then simply set your count using theCount = json.count;
[09:35:04] <duch_kazatel> don't use the var keyword for that second case.  if you do, that var will be bound to that function.
[09:35:24] <farn5w0rth> if anyone has experience with dataTables, please help :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7682615/trouble-using-datatables-tabletools-within-a-jquery-ui-dialog/22231298#22231298
[09:35:26] <duch_kazatel> be aware, however, that you may instead want to put your processing logic into a series of callback function sinstead.
[09:36:13] <duch_kazatel> this is because .get() is asynchronous.
[09:36:25] <dmchale92> I'm using that number to append a number of images to a carousel and unlock them at certain times throughout the day.
[09:37:23] <duch_kazatel> i can see what you're doing - don't do it that way.  pass the count as apart of a callback for your initialization for the carousel instead.
[09:39:08] <Sengoku> Hey, anybody know how I can modify the header of the group plugin of datatables ?
[09:39:11] <Sengoku> google has failed me
[09:39:26] <hxm> hi, im trying to make an ajax request and reading this https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Ajax/ i get confused, what is the correct way to make it working in 1.10? using success: error: or .done .complete?
[09:40:27] <duch_kazatel> hxm it depends if you're using deferred objects or not.
[09:40:42] <hxm> is a json response
[09:40:51] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't mean anything in that question :)
[09:41:07] <hxm> now you can have an idea about how expert I am with deferred objects
[09:41:09] <duch_kazatel> deferred objects are a way to handle the request and response, not what kind of data is getting returned.
[09:41:20] <duch_kazatel> .success and .error are fine.
[09:41:32] <hxm> thanks, im reading now about deferred objecs
[09:41:38] <duch_kazatel> oh wait.
[09:41:56] <duch_kazatel> "Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead."
[09:41:58] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[09:42:19] <duch_kazatel> I didn't realize they were deprecating the old style in favor of deferreds.
[09:42:32] <hxm> so the current way is?
[09:42:43] <hxm> success: error: complete: ?
[09:43:05] <duch_kazatel> use the method chaining version and be cool :)
[09:43:13] <jop008> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/selectmenu-custom-filter/ anyone an example with multiple selects?
[09:43:24] <basiclaser> hey guys, which are the best forums for asking for help with jquery? :)
[09:43:27] <duch_kazatel> .done(), .fail(), .alwauys()
[09:43:29] <duch_kazatel> *always()

[09:56:12] <cprodigy29> I have a jquery  ajax login form posting to a rails api and it works in safari but in chrome I get No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[09:56:35] <duch_kazatel> are the two sides on the same domain?
[09:56:41] <cprodigy29> no
[09:56:46] <duch_kazatel> there's your issue.
[09:56:51] <cprodigy29> how do I fix it
[09:56:52] <duch_kazatel> the server needs to enable that header.
[09:57:13] <cprodigy29> I have another one that just grabs some data jsonp and it works fine
[09:57:26] <duch_kazatel> right.  jsonp gets around that limitation.
[09:57:53] <duch_kazatel> jsonp is short for "JSON with Padding" - it creates a script tag and wraps the data in a callback function.
[09:58:02] <cprodigy29> why does it work in safari then?
[09:58:09] <cprodigy29> and just not chrome
[09:58:16] <duch_kazatel> because Safari isn't looking at the headers it looks like.
[09:58:39] <duch_kazatel> fix the server and you're fine.
[09:58:45] <dmchale92> http://jsfiddle.net/za24H/ I'm trying to append a dynamic number of locally stored images to a carousel. They directory is emptied and refilled daily via a python scraper.
[09:58:59] <cprodigy29> ok fix the server to enable the header
[09:59:04] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[09:59:27] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 that won't work - even if the var was globally scoped, you're going to have a race condition crop up.
[10:00:19] <hxm> hi, I have this code http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4p8WpAV6 that works but I dont know why it is treated as fail, if the response is ok
[10:01:18] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 that's because .get() runs async, like I said before.
[10:01:30] <NoiseEee> hxm: check the server response code?
[10:01:42] <dmchale92> The count isn't going to be changing multiple times in a day though.
[10:01:50] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 doesn't matter.
[10:02:05] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 the .get() still has to call the server and get a response.
[10:02:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/za24H/3/
[10:02:12] <duch_kazatel> do something like this instea.d
[10:02:38] <hxm> NoiseEee: do you mean statusCode? 200
[10:03:20] <NoiseEee> hxm: well i can't see why the fail should fire
[10:04:34] <duch_kazatel> dmchale92 do you see what I'm pointing out about async?
[10:05:55] <dmchale92> Kind of, would the variable be undefined or 0 frequently with the way I had my code set up?
[10:06:12] <duch_kazatel> yes
[10:06:25] <dmchale92> Okay, I see now, thanks!
[10:06:29] <duch_kazatel> just because code appeared after the .get() doesn't mean it'll wait for the .get() to complete before running.
[10:06:41] <dmchale92> Right.
[10:07:34] <jop008> Anyone a fiddle on this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html I want to make it act like a multiple select tool so click and the item clicked is in a resultbox
[10:08:11] <iwaffles> I'm using a slightly broken API to pull a json file and parse it with $.getJSON and one of the values is an integer with a rounding issue (it's too large, larger than 2^53 so it rounds down). Is there a way, with jquery, to make this a string and then parse it so I can keep the original value intact?
[10:08:55] <duch_kazatel> iwaffles jquery isn't a math library - i'm not aware of any faculties for anything like that.
[10:09:48] <iwaffles> Hmm, trying to figure out if there's a way I can manage this
[10:10:03] <basiclaser> iwaffles: result = parseInt(result * Math.pow(10,NumberOfDecimalPlaces))/(Math.pow(10,NumberOfDecimalPlaces));
[10:10:33] <basiclaser> loljustkidding
[10:10:36] <basiclaser> what is computer?
[10:10:36] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:10:38] <iwaffles> lol
[10:13:00] <iwaffles> thanks duch_kazatel, just going to request they update the API to support strings instead.
[10:13:44] <duch_kazatel> iwaffles what's the number going to be used for?
[10:13:56] <synth_> science
[10:13:57] <iwaffles> I'm building a string with it, basically
[10:14:04] <iwaffles> but it's an integer that's > 2^53
[10:14:04] <duch_kazatel> okay, so it's for display.
[10:14:06] <iwaffles> Yeah
[10:14:35] <iwaffles> Unless there's a way to pull it in, convert it to a string before parsing it, it'll have that rounding error since js can't handle ints > 2^53
[10:14:57] <duch_kazatel> nope, because JSON basically is javascript.
[10:15:01] <duch_kazatel> the engine will parse it for you.
[10:15:09] <duch_kazatel> and that limit depends on the browser.
[10:15:32] <duch_kazatel> IE can handle 2^54.  FF can do 2^69
[10:16:09] <iwaffles> Oh that's interesting, didn't know certain browsers handle grater ints
[10:16:21] <iwaffles> 2^53 should be a safe upper bound, right?
[10:16:36] <iwaffles> Isn't this why twitter returns integers as strings and ints for those who can't read large ints?
[10:16:37] <duch_kazatel> sound sabout right.
[10:16:45] <duch_kazatel> *sounds
[10:16:50] <bowenac> anyone here used waypoint.js?
[10:16:57] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ bowenac
[10:16:58] <b-ot> bowenac: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:17:15] <iwaffles> Gotcha, so it's out of my hands then, well. Time for beer? ;)
[10:17:27] <bowenac> it's not adding my class when the waypoint class is in viewable area, only if its in viewable area and I refresh the page.
[10:17:43] <bowenac> so not working once the target is in the scroll position
[10:17:54] <bowenac> Or does anyone know of another script which will do that
[10:18:36] <ska-fan> Is there a difference between :even:visible and :visible:even?
[10:18:49] <duch_kazatel> probably performance.
[10:19:01] <ska-fan> iow, will :visible:even do what I want when I hide table rows?
[10:19:23] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it :)
[10:31:44] <lianzinho> guys, I'm trying to debug a plugin… this is something special regarding a jQuery plugin structure: x.fn.x.init[1] ?
[10:33:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:34:52] <bowenac> no one has used waypoint?
[10:36:07] <BillCriswell> bowenac: I have a bit. What's the issue?
[10:36:32] <bowenac> its not triggering when class is in the viewport... only when I refresh the page with it in the viewport
[10:36:50] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need a scroll callback.
[10:36:59] <bowenac> So when I scroll the page to the waypoint I am trying to trigger nothing happens, if I then refresh the page with the waypoint in the viewable area, it then works
[10:37:29] <BillCriswell> bowenac: I would need to see some code to see what you or waypoints is doing wrong.
[10:37:45] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Waypoints should handle that.
[10:38:07] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/8268jiXs
[10:39:20] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Sure you want offset 100%?
[10:40:10] <bowenac> From my understanding that will trigger when anything is in the view port, otherwise things on the bottom of the page that might be trigger won't be at say 50%... But what do you suggest I try?
[10:41:36] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Take it out and if works you know what to try differently.
[10:41:44] <jop008> Can someone extend this http://jsfiddle.net/69uWh/1/ to pick multiple fields from the list?
[10:41:53] <jop008> Now only 1 can be choosen
[10:43:21] <bowenac> BillCriswell without the offset nothing happens even on refresh
[10:47:11] <BillCriswell> bowenac: http://jsbin.com/qegojiqa/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:47:19] <BillCriswell> Can you set up like what you were going for here?
[10:47:59] <BillCriswell> My little demo works fine, so I'mn not sure what you might be doing outside of this.
[10:48:34] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qegojiqa/2/edit might be a little less laggy... printing things to console seems really expensive sometimes lol
[10:51:38] <markedro> was wondering if anyone knows if the js and css of the jq, 1.4 slider tooltips is (or will be) available anywhere similar to the way it is separately listed here: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/examples/slider/tooltip.php#&ui-state=dialog
[10:52:36] <bowenac> BillCriswell sure thing will post link in a sec
[10:53:58] <BillCriswell> groooovy
[10:56:19] <bowenac> hmmm mine is working on there just fine
[10:56:27] <bowenac> it must be something with the waypoint.js and wordpress
[10:56:33] <bowenac> maybe a conflict
[10:57:55] <luvmyh0nda-[idle> is now away: [reason: Idle after 10h][pager: yes][]
[10:58:13] <bowenac> fixed
[10:58:18] <bowenac> thanks for the help
[10:58:44] <bowenac> my fault forgot I was trying another script for scroll and forgot to remove it which was causing a conflic with this script lol
[10:58:53] <bowenac> noticed it in firebug
[11:01:26] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: ok got it :)
[11:02:18] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: is it better to call success: function after or .done(function) ?
[11:02:24] <cprodigy29> or does it matter?
[11:02:32] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 they both do totally different things
[11:02:50] <duch_kazatel> .success() means things went okay.  .done() means things went.
[11:02:56] <duch_kazatel> see the distinction?
[11:03:24] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: yea done doesn't know if they went good or bad?
[11:03:31] <duch_kazatel> done always runs.
[11:09:37] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: can I run another ajax call in the success?
[11:10:02] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: jsonp to pull data from the server
[11:12:09] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 sure, but you should abstract that out and use deferred objects at that point.
[11:12:28] <duch_kazatel> actually, do you need data from the first call?
[11:12:39] <duch_kazatel> to make the second one I mean,
[11:12:50] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: the fact that it's authorized
[11:13:11] <duch_kazatel> this api sounds kinda funky.
[11:13:19] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: if I try to access contacts without being logged in it sends me to the login page..
[11:13:45] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to do the same thing on a javascript page
[11:14:02] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: have a sign in and if it passes, pull data from the contact page
[11:14:20] <hxm> hi in this http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=zPijUcCw what do I wrong? when .done is executed, r is null
[11:15:28] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 most apis should let you just auth for the request or setup a session./
[11:15:30] <duch_kazatel> just strange.
[11:15:53] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: I'm using devise on rails
[11:15:56] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9397243
[11:16:03] <Tingle> I got a weird issue that shouldnt be happening, I have a element with opacity 0, im adding a transition to it doing :hover with a opacity 1. Which  works just fine if I hover it. But what im wanting is to add a class I called fadeIn to the element and have it do the transition like that. but using addClass('fadeIn') isnt working. the element gets the class, but the transition effect isnt happening... any ideas?
[11:16:08] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 i don't know anything about rails.
[11:16:21] <Tingle> im creating the element with append() and then 150 ms later I use addClass() on it
[11:16:29] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: I very well could be screwing this up badly but at least the it lets me log in
[11:16:43] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: and again that gist shows up right in safari.. just not chrome lol

[11:18:36] <hxm> synth_: but success: will be not deprecated?
[11:19:20] <Tingle> Im creating an element with append() which has a opacity of 0 on it, and then adding a class to it 150ms later with addClass() which has opacity 1 on it with the proper transition, but it wont do the effect. Any ideas?
[11:19:41] <shoky> Tingle: make a jsfiddle
[11:19:47] <Tingle> k
[11:19:59] <synth_> hxm actually, i'm not sure.. where did you see that?
[11:20:19] <shoky> success is not gonna be deprecated anytime soon
[11:20:41] <NoiseEee> tell that to communist countries
[11:20:45] <NoiseEee> tyvm, goodnight
[11:20:53] * synth_ golf clap
[11:21:16] <hxm> ah no, I missunderstood the you must use the success/error/complete callback options instead of the corresponding methods of the jqXHR object such as jqXHR.done() or the deprecated jqXHR.success().
[11:21:39] <hxm> the brain translator random fail, you know
[11:27:30] <Tingle> shoky: ok this fiddle doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/tR89n/1/

[11:39:58] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: You would need to do it after the content is loaded.
[11:40:03] <lianzinho> is that because of the asynchronous activity?
[11:40:21] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: but just some times… not always...
[11:40:41] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: Exactly because of that.
[11:40:52] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: Are you using .load() ?
[11:41:38] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: in fact… i'm modifying the API of a plugin… don't know exactly when the image is being loaded...
[11:43:16] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: but what makes no sense, is that the rest of the plugin, makes use of properties which shouldn't be there too… if the image hasn't been loaded...
[11:43:41] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: like data- attributes
[11:49:01] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: I guess you'd just need to wait for those images to be laoded.
[11:49:39] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: well.. the img is in the element "slider"
[11:49:41] <lianzinho> i'm using
[11:49:46] <lianzinho> slider.width()
[11:49:53] <lianzinho> and it gives me the width
[11:50:22] <lianzinho> are there anything I could check directly to shit element to ensure that it has been loaded?
[11:50:37] <lianzinho> to this*
[11:52:35] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: There's an imagesLoaded plugin I used once that could be helpful. http://desandro.github.io/imagesloaded/
[11:53:07] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: but do you think it will be usable INSIDE another plugin?
[11:53:33] <BillCriswell> Of course.
[12:04:40] <synth_> hxm you're welcome :D
[12:07:35] <medicineuk> does anyone know why this crashed the console?
[12:07:36] <medicineuk> http://pastebin.com/8AEvkp67
[12:07:58] <medicineuk> change number++ on line 7 to number +1 and it works fine
[12:08:55] <shoky> medicineuk:  number++ returns the previous value of number, not the incremented value
[12:09:14] <devkinetic> hey stupid question here. How can I get the text value of a select option that already have a value parameter. http://jsfiddle.net/Avgpy/ simple fiddle with the test.
[12:09:15] <shoky> you have no reason to increment it. just pass number+1
[12:09:23] <medicineuk> any idea why that is and it does increment before sending
[12:09:39] <shoky> that's how x++ works
[12:09:44] <medicineuk> yer it's fine I was just wondering the reason behind it
[12:09:48] <shoky> it increments and returns the previous value
[12:09:53] <shoky> ++x  returns the incremented value
[12:10:15] <shoky> but you have no need to increment anyway, you just want to pass number+1
[12:10:53] <medicineuk> lol thanks
[12:11:12] <medicineuk> I never knew that about it returning the number it was sent
[12:11:28] <medicineuk> god how did I get this far without knowing that
[12:11:31] <medicineuk> cheers mate.
[12:15:43] <enkindle> I'm having trouble googling my issue with the tablesorter plugin. I'm trying to figure out an issue with the initial sort order I'm setting and all I can find is HOW to set it, which I already know. If I set my initial sort to [[2, 0]] (which is ascending) it sorts correctly but the header has to be clicked twice before it will swap to sorting decending and works fine after that.
[12:17:19] <enkindle> And I already figured out what to do... have to pretty much trick it by doing sortInitialOrder: 'desc',
[12:18:01] <lianzinho> if I prepend an img element which does not exists yet it will be downloaded in the exact moment? or will it be an asynchronous call ?
[12:18:30] <enkindle> Its async technically
[12:18:39] <enkindle> You can $('img').on('load', ...);
[12:18:59] <bengalo> is there an event i can track that fires after the dialog for datepicker is gone? onClose will fire while its still visible..
[12:19:43] <lianzinho> enkindle: the code is like this: opts.container.prepend( slide );   "slide" is the img element…
[12:19:45] <lolmaus> What does the `.eq()` method name stand for?
[12:19:56] <BillCriswell> equal.
[12:20:03] <BillCriswell> I guess.
[12:20:05] <enkindle> lianzinho, that code will continue on immediately and the image downloads asyncronously
[12:20:21] <BillCriswell> ... Now that I'm thinking about it I have no clue.
[12:20:51] <BillCriswell> lolmaus: I think of it as like... "getByIndex()"
[12:21:15] <lianzinho> enkindle: hmmm… in this case I would need to know when this image gets totally downloaded to keep going
[12:21:18] <lolmaus> BillCriswell: yeah, i know what it does, i'm just curious what "eq" means.
[12:21:30] <lolmaus> Kinda ambiguous method name.
[12:21:32] <enkindle> lianzinho...sec
[12:21:35] <BillCriswell> lolmaus: Agreed.
[12:21:43] <BillCriswell> Now that I think about it. Dammit.
[12:21:48] <BillCriswell> Why did I have to start thinking about it.
[12:21:54] <lolmaus> BillCriswell: lol
[12:22:04] <enkindle> slide.on('load', function { //done downloading });
[12:22:06] <enkindle> then add it
[12:22:08] <enkindle> append it*
[12:22:26] <enkindle> whoops  slide.on('load', function(e) { //done downloading });
[12:22:53] <BillCriswell> lolmaus: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15059207/what-does-eq-in-the-jquery-eq-method-stand-for
[12:23:04] <raj> what would be the purpose of having jquery in node?
[12:23:28] <synth_> wut
[12:23:53] <BillCriswell> lolmaus: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15059383 I like this reasoning.
[12:23:57] <shoky> raj you can have a DOM tree outside the browser
[12:24:03] <systemfault> raj: DOM manipulations using JSDOM or similar.
[12:24:20] <systemfault> raj: But there aren't many usecases
[12:24:54] <lolmaus> BillCriswell: thx man.
[12:25:13] <lolmaus> BillCriswell: now i go have a nap in peace. ^_^ Good night.
[12:25:14] <raj> shoky, meaning, modifying html outside of the browser?
[12:25:32] <raj> perhaps for template rendering prior to sending to the client?
[12:25:34] <BillCriswell> lolmaus: Haha
[12:25:53] <BillCriswell> I'm even going to login to up vote this guy.
[12:25:59] <shoky> raj: for example, fetching some website from node, and parsing the html into a DOM tree and extracting data out of it
[12:26:21] <shoky> so jquery could be used for the "extracting data out of it" part
[12:26:31] <shoky> but there are probably nicer libs for such shit
[12:28:48] <secleinteer> hi, can someone tell me where the 'base' class referenced in jquery.ui.widget is defined? i'm trying to load jquery.ui.widget in my app, but i'm getting an error because base is not defined
[12:31:26] <shoky> secleinteer: you're getting that error just by including jquery.ui.widget.js ?
[12:31:37] <shoky> or are you getting the error when trying to use it
[12:32:09] <secleinteer> shoky: just by including it
[12:32:19] <secleinteer> i am including in this order: jquery, jquery.ui.core, jquery.ui.widget
[12:32:34] <shoky> what's the error exactly
[12:33:01] <secleinteer> shoky: "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function "
[12:33:11] <secleinteer> shoky: at line 72
[12:33:20] <secleinteer> which is: "basePrototype = new base();"
[12:33:39] <shoky> secleinteer: that means you (or some other script you're including) is calling the $.widget function
[12:33:50] <shoky> with bad arguments, i guess
[12:34:07] <shoky> base is just an argument to that function
[12:34:37] <shoky> or defaults to $.Widget which is defined in that same file
[12:35:00] <secleinteer> shoky: you're right, i've included a third party script, jQDateRangeSlider.js
[12:35:04] <secleinteer> that must be the issue
[12:35:16] <shoky> probably. look at the error's stack trace
[12:49:31] <saml> hey, how can I remove this and two sibling elements?
[12:49:44] <secleinteer> shoky: ok, it's passing in $.ui.rangeSlider as the 'base' argument
[12:49:48] <secleinteer> is that not a valid argument?
[12:50:03] <secleinteer> it appears to be undefined
[12:50:16] <secleinteer> (i have added jquery.ui.slider to my asset pipeline)
[12:50:49] <secleinteer> $.ui.slider exists, but not $.ui.rangeSlider
[12:51:25] <saml> .siblings() give me all siblings. but i want immediate two siblings
[12:51:43] <saml> if this element is the first or the last, only previous or after siblings
[12:52:04] <BillCriswell> saml: So you want to delete three elements or just two?
[12:52:09] <raj> shoky, gotcha
[12:52:10] <raj> thanks
[12:52:15] <saml> BillCriswell, three. maximally.
[12:52:25] <saml> .prev() and .next()
[12:52:52] <BillCriswell> saml: Hmm..
[12:53:17] <BillCriswell> This is one of those things where there's like 100 ways to do it but I'm going to be picky about how.
[12:53:39] <saml> $('ul.topStories li:hidden').show().each(function() { var x = $(this); x.height('56px'); x.find('img').css('margin', 0);}); var newsfeed = $('.newsFeed'); newsfeed.empty(); newsfeed.prev().empty(); newsfeed.next().empty();
[12:53:42] <saml> this works hahahhahahahha
[12:53:56] <saml> don't have to remove i think. .empty() removes them visually
[12:54:21] <andrew9183> that looks incredibly messy
[12:54:23] <BillCriswell> saml: Unless there's some styling that still allows them to display.
[12:55:37] <saml> yah this will be optimize.ly A/B test
[13:14:04] <shoky> secleinteer: jquery-ui doesn't have any $.ui.rangeSlider
[13:14:43] <secleinteer> shoky: yeah, i ended up changing to $.ui.slider, hopefully that doesn't screw other things up
[13:16:07] <shoky> secleinteer: i think you're only including one file from that plugin..
[13:16:15] <shoky> secleinteer: don't arbitrarily change code like that
[13:16:17] <duch_kazatel> btw if any of you have any sense, never buy a pool.
[13:16:31] <drej> duch_kazatel ....
[13:16:33] <drej> dude wtf
[13:16:37] <drej> i just bought like 3 pools
[13:16:38] <drej> and now you tell me ?
[13:16:44] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[13:16:50] <shoky> secleinteer: https://github.com/ghusse/jQRangeSlider  see  jQDateRangeSlider.js is only one of the files, it depends on some of the others
[13:17:37] <secleinteer> shoky: http://ghusse.github.io/jQRangeSlider/documentation.html says that the only required deps are jquery, jquery ui core, and jquery ui widget
[13:17:50] <secleinteer> but then there was a bug report where the author said you also needed to add jquery ui mouse, so who knows
[13:18:02] <shoky> secleinteer: but it depends on itself too :) you're not including the plugin itself, only one file from it
[13:18:37] <nhulea> hey is there a way to remove the ability to type into an input field ?
[13:18:38] <shoky> secleinteer: the docs you just linked to say to include jQRangeSlider-min.js   not  jqDateRangeSlider.js
[13:18:55] <shoky> secleinteer: oh sorry
[13:19:00] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: what you got against pools
[13:19:08] <duch_kazatel> i have one now.
[13:19:13] <jphase> too much chlorine
[13:19:14] <nhulea> and
[13:19:20] <duch_kazatel> boy howdy is that shit expensive.
[13:19:21] <nhulea> whats the issue
[13:19:29] <duch_kazatel> plus the chemistry is all complicated.
[13:19:38] <duch_kazatel> (okay so it's not that hard but still)./
[13:19:40] <drej> we have a pool in the building
[13:19:41] <nhulea> yeah a true money pit
[13:19:44] <drej> and its salt water pool
[13:19:50] <drej> fuck chemicals
[13:19:54] <duch_kazatel> salt is a chemical.
[13:19:55] <jphase> salt water pool is AWESEOM!
[13:19:58] <drej> YOURE A CHEMICAL
[13:20:00] <duch_kazatel> so is water.
[13:20:02] <jphase> oooo burn!
[13:20:08] <nhulea> pool party at duch_kazatel's house !
[13:20:09] <drej> CHEMICAL BURN
[13:20:12] <duch_kazatel> aaaahahahahaha
[13:20:13] <BillCriswell> nhulea: disabled attribute.
[13:20:13] <jphase> lol
[13:20:17] <drej> i'll see myself out
[13:20:26] <duch_kazatel> dude i have to put hydrochloric acid in that shiz.
[13:20:28] <secleinteer> shoky: so i think i need to include jQRangeSlider before jQDateRangeSlider
[13:20:31] <duch_kazatel> that makes it safer
[13:20:33] <BillCriswell> You guys have polls and shit?
[13:20:35] <nhulea> damn
[13:20:41] <secleinteer> i think $.ui.rangeSlider is defined in jQRangeSlider
[13:20:49] <drej> i live in a baller condo
[13:20:52] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah i bought my first house this past october.
[13:20:57] <nhulea> I dont duch_kazatel does I am more of a hot tub guy ahah
[13:21:03] <BillCriswell> nhulea: <input name="name" value="Bill" disabled>
[13:21:11] <drej> we have a gym and all that regular stuff, but then we also have a theater room, salt water pool, free yoga instructors and gym people
[13:21:16] <drej> AND i have in-condo dry cleaning
[13:21:17] <duch_kazatel> niiice.
[13:21:21] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Oh nice! I thought you guys were talking about where you work haha
[13:21:22] <drej> like they come in and dry clean my shit while im at work
[13:21:24] <nhulea> BillCriswell: sweet thanks !
[13:21:26] <drej> and put it back in my closet
[13:21:36] <nhulea> damn no pools here
[13:21:36] <jphase> that's creepy
[13:21:46] <shoky> secleinteer:  you need to include the file that comes in the zip download
[13:21:56] <drej> jphase its on request, not like they do it all the time :)
[13:21:59] <shoky> secleinteer: jQDateRangeSlider-min.js
[13:22:13] <shoky> secleinteer: not the one from the lib/ directory
[13:23:13] <drej> any of you guys going to jQuery TO next weekend ?
[13:23:41] <BillCriswell> Oooo, canada would be nice.
[13:23:47] <BillCriswell> I need a passport.
[13:23:51] <duch_kazatel> nah too far for me.
[13:23:57] <jfewdibfuerwi> guys
[13:24:00] <jfewdibfuerwi> I'm using bootstrap
[13:24:13] <jfewdibfuerwi> This is what i don't manage to do:
[13:24:28] <jfewdibfuerwi> When I collapse a div, I want some properties of another div to be changed
[13:24:32] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ jfewdibfuerwi
[13:24:32] <b-ot> jfewdibfuerwi: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:24:32] <BillCriswell> Is saying "guys" like a cultural thing in some places as a greeting? A lot of people seem to do that but I find it funny every time I hear it.
[13:24:35] <jfewdibfuerwi> How can it be done?
[13:24:43] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:25:02] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell I always imagine somebody coming in all rushed and worried.
[13:25:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Exactly!
[13:25:21] <BillCriswell> "oh shit guys I'm in trouble"
[13:25:29] <duch_kazatel> eyes all glassy from a day of worry and work.
[13:25:42] <duch_kazatel> and jfewdibfuerwi bind to the event and edit the other div.
[13:25:50] <BillCriswell> jfewdibfuerwi: What are you using to collapse it?
[13:26:05] <jfewdibfuerwi> duch_kazatel: Indeed the question is how to bind to the event
[13:26:10] <jfewdibfuerwi> i'm uploading the thing
[13:26:23] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi $('theThing)
[13:26:26] <duch_kazatel> err 1 sec.
[13:26:38] <jfewdibfuerwi> http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/
[13:26:54] <BillCriswell> jfewdibfuerwi: $('.foo').slideUp(500, function(){ $('.bar').attr('data-awesome', 'totally'); });
[13:27:06] <duch_kazatel> $('theThing').on('click', function(){ $('theOtherThing').css('display', 'none')});
[13:27:10] <secleinteer> shoky: huh, both adding jQRangeSlider.js so that it loaded before jQDateRangeSlider.js and just added jQDateRangeSlider-min.js fixed the problem. why doesn't the minified version require the other file?
[13:27:40] <shoky> secleinteer: because it's a bundle that included the other dependencies from the lib
[13:27:44] <shoky> includes*
[13:28:57] <secleinteer> shoky: i see, thanks for the help!
[13:29:59] <BillCriswell> I love that LinkedIn is telling me my education is missing.
[13:30:15] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hahahaha you didn't go to college either, did you?
[13:30:42] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[13:30:47] <duch_kazatel> high five
[13:30:55] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:31:32] <BillCriswell> It got awkward once at work. I was starting here and everyone was like "so where did you go to school?" and I was awkwardly like "Uhhh, I didn't" and I heard an "Oh"
[13:32:04] <duch_kazatel> i had that a few times, too!  my strategy was always "I started working shortly after I turned 18."
[13:32:57] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Same! "Got lucky, found a job right out of high school"
[13:33:06] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[13:33:48] <cprodigy29> this is my work so far http://pastie.org/8884762 I got the login to work but the logout is sending to server as options instead of delete
[13:35:36] <jfewdibfuerwi> i don't understand how to interact with the ground of bootstrap
[13:35:45] <jfewdibfuerwi> you know the collapse function is inside bootstrap itself
[13:35:57] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi have a link to the docs for that one?
[13:36:14] <jfewdibfuerwi> no no i don't think i need to modify bootstrap
[13:36:18] <jfewdibfuerwi> there must be a simpler way
[13:36:19] <duch_kazatel> no, you don't.
[13:36:22] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible iudea.
[13:36:23] <duch_kazatel> *idea
[13:36:33] <duch_kazatel> find the docs :)
[13:36:34] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[13:36:38] <jfewdibfuerwi> but in the javascript action there's a call to functino #collapseRadio
[13:36:49] <jfewdibfuerwi> and i don't find it anywhere in the code
[13:36:51] <jfewdibfuerwi> http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/
[13:37:05] <duch_kazatel> look in the documentation for bootstrap duder.
[13:37:32] <jfewdibfuerwi> uff
[13:37:38] <jfewdibfuerwi> i wanted to do everything from skratch
[13:37:40] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[13:37:47] <duch_kazatel> areyou not using bootstrap?
[13:37:51] <jfewdibfuerwi> and a dude told me: nooh and when you're not here i can't modify it
[13:37:58] <jfewdibfuerwi> please use bootstrap
[13:38:04] <jfewdibfuerwi> and i've been forced to use the sh*t
[13:38:11] <cprodigy29> lol
[13:38:14] <jfewdibfuerwi> i don't wanna read the whole doc now
[13:38:35] <duch_kazatel> okay let me find the relevant part of the documentation.  what feature are you using?
[13:38:36] <jfewdibfuerwi> i'll find a way without the doc... i promise
[13:38:43] <jfewdibfuerwi> just "collapse"
[13:39:00] <jfewdibfuerwi> i'm modifying a document which hasn't been written by me
[13:39:04] <duch_kazatel> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse
[13:39:15] <duch_kazatel> look under events.
[13:39:32] <duch_kazatel> show.bs.collapse, shown.bs.collapse, hide.bs.collapse, hidden.bs.collapse
[13:40:10] <duch_kazatel> so $('section').on('show.bs.collapse', function(){ $('otherThing').css('display', 'none') });
[13:40:24] <jfewdibfuerwi> great.
[13:40:25] <jfewdibfuerwi> thx
[13:40:27] <jfewdibfuerwi> thanks man
[13:40:39] <duch_kazatel> google is your friend.
[13:46:45] <BlinkyBill> I have some pageinit events on my pages, which used to work well.  For some reason somthing in my code has changed, such that the event now only fires when I switch to the page.  It used to fire when the dom was loaded.
[13:47:08] <BlinkyBill> any ideas what could be causing this?
[13:47:58] <duch_kazatel> how are they hooked up?
[13:48:42] <BlinkyBill> $("#pageLocalConfig").on("pageinit", function () { console.log("init config"); });
[13:49:18] <duch_kazatel> what's firing the pageinit event?
[13:50:02] <BlinkyBill> In jquery mobile, it should fire when a "page" is parsed.
[13:50:47] <duch_kazatel> try $(document).on("pageinit",'#pageLocalConfig',  function () { console.log("init config"); }); instead
[13:51:10] <BlinkyBill> yep, already tried that.  Also tried using live instaed of on.
[13:51:17] <duch_kazatel> don't use .live()
[13:51:19] <duch_kazatel> it's deprecate.
[13:51:22] <duch_kazatel> *deprecated.
[13:51:32] <duch_kazatel> that means the event isn't firing.  any console errors?
[13:51:38] <duch_kazatel> or propagation funk?
[13:51:42] * jphase read "it's deprecate" and imagined a russian accent
[13:51:47] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:51:59] <BlinkyBill> This worked for years, but only stopped working recently, so assume there's something else in my code that's causing the issues.
[13:52:15] <BlinkyBill> no console errors
[13:52:31] <duch_kazatel> are you doing anything to stop event propagation?
[13:53:22] <BlinkyBill> Not that I'm aware of.  If I change to the page explicitly, the event then fires.  So it's almost like it no longer parses the page untill it's loaded.
[13:53:52] <duch_kazatel> "it no longer parses the page until it's loaded" - huh?
[13:55:11] <BlinkyBill> ok, will explain in more detail.
[13:55:26] <duch_kazatel> some code in a jsfiddle would be really helpful at this point.
[13:55:32] <duch_kazatel> if you can narrow it down at all that is.
[13:55:37] <BlinkyBill> good idea.

[13:59:11] <_disconnect_> does anyone know exactly what this problem is? i open a jquery ui dialog with .dialog([{text:"mybutton", click: function() { alert("FOO"); }}]) but when the dialog opens the text on the button is 0 and the click event doesnt work
[13:59:11] <duch_kazatel> woooh sprint planning
[13:59:22] <drej> yay for sprints
[13:59:26] <_disconnect_> not like this, where it works totally fine http://jsfiddle.net/9SJDR/
[13:59:28] <duch_kazatel> brb
[13:59:29] <xqo> how can i make an uploaded image the background of <body>? http://jsfiddle.net/N6g92/
[13:59:39] <_disconnect_> and not like this which doesnt work either http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4929394/assign-id-to-jquery-dialog-button
[13:59:47] <drej> xqo you have to upload the file first, then reference it
[13:59:50] <Jattenalle> _disconnect_, why are there [] ?
[14:00:04] <_disconnect_> for multiple buttons
[14:00:13] <xqo> drej i should rephrase: how can i set a local image file as the background of <body>?
[14:00:25] <drej> the same way.
[14:00:28] <Jattenalle> _disconnect_, is that shorthand for buttons: [{}] ?
[14:00:47] <_disconnect_> ah sorry
[14:00:53] <_disconnect_> yes, i forgot the buttons:
[14:01:08] <Jattenalle> also still not sure why you need the [] :/ but im fairly new to jquery :)
[14:01:17] <Jattenalle> anyhow, yeah that seems to be the issue
[14:01:19] <Jattenalle> missing buttons:
[14:01:20] <_disconnect_>  .dialog({buttons: [{text:"mybutton", click: function() { alert("FOO"); }}]})
[14:01:37] <Jattenalle> did it work?
[14:02:18] <_disconnect_> what work?
[14:02:20] <_disconnect_> im desperate
[14:02:42] <Jattenalle> oh, i thought your code was missing the buttons: thing, but i guess you only missed it in what you typed in here
[14:03:16] <Jattenalle> _disconnect_, well have a look at https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation (view source)
[14:03:41] <Jattenalle> _disconnect_, it would also help if you could paste your actual code on jsfiddle
[14:12:08] <CrazyZurfer> hi guys... why is that when copying jquery mobile's demo theme, the left menu goes down when in wide screen?? http://jsfiddle.net/p6K6t/
[14:12:20] <CrazyZurfer> i just copied everything as is in the demo
[14:16:23] <cprodigy29> I have a single page jquery site I'm working on and I'm authenticating it to an api.. when i get the success back what do I do so that the site knows it's been authenticated to the server already?
[14:16:45] <cprodigy29> this is what I have now https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9400902 and I can log in and on safari it lets me log out but chrome doesn't like the logout code
[14:16:51] <duch_away> cprodigy29 think about why that might not be a good idea...
[14:17:06] <cprodigy29> duch_away: why what might not be?
[14:17:23] <duch_away> letting javascript determine if you're authenticated.
[14:17:55] <duch_away> are you going to verify all transactions on the server-side?
[14:18:30] <cprodigy29> duch_away: yes
[14:18:57] <duch_away> mmk.  because doing that sort of logic client-side is a bad idea :)
[14:19:43] <cprodigy29> duch_away: i have a rails app I built.. all I want to do is login to it  and view the contacts
[14:19:59] <cprodigy29> duch_away: this has been so stressful but I've learned a lot already
[14:20:10] <cprodigy29> duch_away: json jsonp cors etc
[14:20:31] <duch_away> right
[14:21:10] <cprodigy29> duch_away: I'm able to log in and I get a successful message back.. i just am stuck and don't know what to do next
[14:21:31] <cprodigy29> duch_away: how I should display the contacts.. which I've already written that code and it works too
[14:21:41] <duch_away> return the data you want to display.
[14:21:44] <cprodigy29> duch_away: feels like I'm doing something wrong though
[14:21:46] <duch_away> parse that into html and go aware.
[14:21:50] <duch_away> *go on
[14:22:40] <cprodigy29> duch_away: I make an ajax call to authenticate.. it sends the login info.. server says I'm clear.. to get the data I have to do another ajax call jsonp.. how should I set that up
[14:22:47] <cprodigy29> in the success from the first call?
[14:23:00] <duch_away> generally, you'd make a single call to do both.
[14:23:23] <duch_away> you'd send along your authentication details and, if successful, return the data you want to display.
[14:23:30] <duch_away> ortherwise throw an error some way.
[14:23:59] <cprodigy29> but the authentication and call for data are on two different urls
[14:24:12] <cprodigy29> duch_away: did you glance at the gist by any chance? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9400902
[14:24:29] <duch_away> nope - I don't know anything about ruby/rails.  but that setup seems odd to ,e.
[14:24:31] <duch_away> *me
[14:25:10] <cprodigy29> duch_away: authenticating through a server?
[14:25:20] <duch_away> no, the two separate endpoints to handle it.
[14:26:16] <cprodigy29> duch_away: it would seem like I should be able to auth and then get data without making a call to the other url
[14:26:32] <duch_away> i would set it up that way.
[14:27:03] <duch_away> *but I'd change the server-side to use one URL.
[14:27:47] <cprodigy29> duch_away: and on the server distinguish by the type of call?
[14:28:00] <cprodigy29> duch_away: or params sent?
[14:28:06] <duch_away> you make one call - let the server authenticate it and, if all is well, return the proper daqta.
[14:28:19] <duch_away> often, you'd do something like that through session management.
[14:28:52] <duch_away> http://www.voiceoftech.com/swhitley/index.php/2011/02/what-is-the-best-practice-for-authenticating-ajax-calls/ this is a guide you should read.
[14:28:59] <cprodigy29> duch_away: ok thanks
[14:29:32] <cprodigy29> duch_away: I saw something about storing the session in local storage
[14:30:01] <duch_away> use cookies.
[14:31:06] <cprodigy29> duch_away: i won't have any in mobile i believe
[14:31:13] <duch_away> huh?
[14:31:15] <duch_away> yes you will.
[14:31:19] <duch_away> mobile supports cookies.
[14:31:41] <duch_away> go read about sessions :)
[14:31:43] <cprodigy29> duch_away: oh.. i thought i couldn't for some reason
[14:31:45] <cprodigy29> duch_away: ok
[14:31:53] <duch_away> that's exactly the sort of thing you need to be reading about.
[14:36:57] <white_magic> does anyone know if it's possible to obtain the ID of the SELECT element, given the OPTION element (that fires an 'onchange' event)?
[14:37:21] <guilund> hey guys good day
[14:37:28] <jfewdibfuerwi> duch_away: it looks like the function doesn't get called on hte event
[14:37:36] <jfewdibfuerwi> i followed the instructions (doc)
[14:37:43] <guilund> i wanna know if someone have solved the jquery ui sortable flickergin problem
[14:37:48] <guilund> flickering
[14:37:59] <guilund> someone?
[14:38:03] <guilund> any tips?
[14:38:38] <BlinkyBill> So I've got a jsfiddle up with my jquery mobile pageinit woes.  See http://jsfiddle.net/Kn6Rp/19/
[14:38:43] <duch_away> white_magic are you using jquery?
[14:38:49] <white_magic> in part
[14:39:04] <BlinkyBill> I am expecting hte pageinit to fire straight away, but only fires after I navigate to a different page
[14:39:07] <jfewdibfuerwi> http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/   -- http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js
[14:39:11] <duch_away> white_magic console.log() the event.target
[14:40:12] <white_magic> duch_away: currently I fire a custom method on onchange.. how would I access the event?
[14:40:25] <duch_away> fiddle it please.
[14:41:09] <duch_away> because in jquery land it'd be $('thing').on('event', function(eventObject){/* event object is the thing */});
[14:41:57] <white_magic> ok
[14:44:40] <white_magic> duch_away: I only got this far: http://jsfiddle.net/vXfF4/
[14:44:45] <white_magic> i'm trying to display an alert
[14:44:47] <white_magic> so I can debug
[14:44:57] <duch_away> just use a debugger man.
[14:45:00] <duch_away> or the console.
[14:45:21] <white_magic> do you see anything wrong syntactically in my example?
[14:45:46] <duch_away> http://jsfiddle.net/vXfF4/1/
[14:45:48] <duch_away> not really.
[14:46:17] <duch_away> except using onchange is bad.
[14:46:30] <white_magic> i see neither a console on jsfiddle nor do I get alert boxes'
[14:46:41] <duch_away> http://jsfiddle.net/vXfF4/3/
[14:46:42] <duch_away> there.
[14:47:00] <duch_away> fff typo.
[14:47:30] <duch_away> http://jsfiddle.net/vXfF4/5/ there we go.
[14:47:54] <jfewdibfuerwi> duch_away: it looks like the function doesn't get called with the event -- http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/ -- http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js
[14:48:16] <duch_away> what function
[14:48:46] <jfewdibfuerwi> the anonymous one http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js
[14:48:56] <jfewdibfuerwi> it doesn't matter what's innside, indeed i simply put a console.log
[14:49:22] <jfewdibfuerwi> but when i click on the   topleft button "audio"  the console shows nothing
[14:50:10] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi then that isn't emitting the event?
[14:50:32] <jfewdibfuerwi> i'm not sure if it's not emitting the event,
[14:50:33] <duch_kazatel> what are you binding to?
[14:50:41] <duch_kazatel> like, what on the page?
[14:50:42] <jfewdibfuerwi> or my function doesn't fetching it
[14:50:48] <checkit> Hey guys. So I'm using $.getScript("assets/js/plugins/plugins.js") in my code but this is obviously problematic on pages like /page/slug/ because it is prepending the url to the request (ie: /page/slug/assets/js....) thereby resulting in a 404... How can I accomplish this without providing the domain name to the getScript request?
[14:50:49] <jfewdibfuerwi> the top left button "AUDIO"
[14:50:52] <duch_kazatel> it's an event binding problem,
[14:51:09] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi I'm seeing it work...
[14:51:30] <jfewdibfuerwi> duch_away: me too, but that's not the thing i've just written
[14:51:43] <jfewdibfuerwi> that collapse works without my jquery function
[14:51:49] <jfewdibfuerwi> it's just a class assignment
[14:51:52] <jfewdibfuerwi> (bootstrap)
[14:51:54] <duch_kazatel> checkit prepend your document.domain to the path
[14:52:13] <white_magic> duch_away: it works, many thanks\
[14:52:25] <duch_kazatel> white_magic of course.
[14:52:43] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi huh?  let's start from the beginning. what isn't happening where?
[14:52:55] <jfewdibfuerwi> so
[14:53:01] <jfewdibfuerwi> if you don't run my code nothing change
[14:53:02] <jfewdibfuerwi> *s
[14:53:05] <jfewdibfuerwi> The issue is:
[14:53:10] <jfewdibfuerwi> i've got the chat with 100% height
[14:53:11] <jfewdibfuerwi> BUT
[14:53:47] <jfewdibfuerwi> whtn the radio zone is shown, for it to stay onscreen, I must decrease its height of 50px
[14:54:02] <duch_kazatel> the height of the IRC section?
[14:54:11] <jfewdibfuerwi> otherwise it goes down on the screen and you can't type chat messages
[14:54:15] <jfewdibfuerwi> yes
[14:54:25] <duch_kazatel> you want hidden.bs.collapse and shown.bs.collapse
[14:54:27] <jfewdibfuerwi> the height of #page-content-wrapper
[14:54:36] <BlinkyBill> duch_kazatel, I got my jsfiddle up.  it's at http://jsfiddle.net/Kn6Rp/24/.  Any insight would be appreciated.
[14:54:38] <jfewdibfuerwi> indeed http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js
[14:54:39] <duch_kazatel> not show and hide.
[14:54:48] <jfewdibfuerwi> nono, show and hide
[14:54:57] <jfewdibfuerwi> the transition must start together with the other one
[14:54:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:55:00] <jfewdibfuerwi> so that it's fluid
[14:55:04] <duch_kazatel> then animate it.
[14:55:13] <duch_kazatel> you want to animate the height of thge #wrapper div
[14:55:15] <jfewdibfuerwi> ye that's a particular which i can't do later
[14:55:17] <jfewdibfuerwi> the problem is
[14:55:23] <jfewdibfuerwi> The height is not being applied
[14:55:27] <jfewdibfuerwi> it's a JS problem.
[14:55:36] <duch_kazatel> how are you setting the height?
[14:55:52] <jfewdibfuerwi> in the function i linked http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js
[14:55:58] <jfewdibfuerwi> you know it doesn't matter how, because,
[14:56:04] <jfewdibfuerwi> whatever i write in that function
[14:56:05] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi thjat's not "a function"
[14:56:08] <jfewdibfuerwi> it doesn't get executeed
[14:56:15] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi it's getting executed RIGHT NOW.
[14:56:20] <jfewdibfuerwi> function(){ var diff  = $('#wrapper').height()-50) +' px';console.log(diff); $('#page-content-wrapper').css('height', diff); });
[14:56:39] <jfewdibfuerwi> why the console doesn't show anything then
[14:56:48] <duch_kazatel> it'sworking for me.
[14:56:51] <jfewdibfuerwi> you still thinking of the show/hide
[14:57:05] <duch_kazatel> right, because that's what you're binding to.
[14:57:15] <jfewdibfuerwi> To understand, do this:  login to irc with  the radio open
[14:57:26] <jfewdibfuerwi> you'll see the bottom zone hidden
[14:57:33] <jfewdibfuerwi> and you can't type messages.
[14:57:59] <jfewdibfuerwi> bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/
[14:58:04] <duch_kazatel> you're targting the wrong area.
[14:58:09] <duch_kazatel> stop linking the same thing over and over again.
[14:58:13] <jfewdibfuerwi> okay
[14:58:24] <duch_kazatel> .frame1 <- edit that height.
[14:58:27] <duch_kazatel> not #wrapper.
[14:58:31] <jfewdibfuerwi> no.
[14:58:34] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:58:36] <jfewdibfuerwi> indeed i'm not editing wrapper
[14:58:43] <duch_kazatel> then you aren't making sense.
[14:58:51] <duch_kazatel> also: you can't edit children of iframes that easily.
[14:58:53] <jfewdibfuerwi> i'm taking the height of wrapper to calculate the right height for it
[14:59:17] <jfewdibfuerwi> it's  #page-content-wrapper  which i must modify the height
[14:59:28] <jfewdibfuerwi> IT's not a children of an iframe
[14:59:42] <duch_kazatel> why are you editing the height of the radio?  thatall ready works.
[14:59:47] <jfewdibfuerwi> oh my god
[14:59:47] <duch_kazatel> you're making absolutely no sense at this point.
[14:59:53] <jfewdibfuerwi> oh - my - god
[14:59:57] <jfewdibfuerwi> Maybe it's me.
[15:00:00] <jfewdibfuerwi> Maybe it's my english
[15:00:02] <jfewdibfuerwi> I try again.
[15:00:05] <jfewdibfuerwi> All in one line.
[15:00:13] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[15:02:25] <jfewdibfuerwi> The show/hide function works. I repeat, WORKS. It's not the issue now. It works through bootstrap, indeed it is just a css class change with a transition. ---------- NOW: Even if the show/hide function works, there is a problem: when it's shown, you can't type anything in the chat: that's simple to understand, you just try. login and try (remember,
[15:02:25] <jfewdibfuerwi>  with the radio shown).
[15:02:40] <duch_kazatel> i did that.
[15:03:35] <jfewdibfuerwi> For this reason, #page-content-wrapper 's height must be modified.  Earlier, it was 100% of the parent (which is #wrapper), BUT when the radio is shown, it gets bigger than 100% .... indeed it gets  100% + 50px (the height of the radio)
[15:03:37] <duch_kazatel> so which div are you trying to edit instead?
[15:03:43] <duch_kazatel> #page-content-wrapper?
[15:03:49] <jfewdibfuerwi> This is what I have to do with jQuery. ^
[15:04:30] <jfewdibfuerwi> i have to decrease the height of  #page-content-wrapper  of  50px  when the chat is shown, and
[15:04:42] <jfewdibfuerwi> increase the height of #page-content-wrapper  of  50px  again, when the chat is hidden.
[15:06:03] <duch_kazatel> dude you're making this way too hard.  either fix your CSS so #collapseChat or .frame1 are actually 100% or edit the height of the frame instead.  editing the height of #page-content-wrapper is a hack and won't fix the underlying problem.
[15:06:21] <jfewdibfuerwi> no no
[15:06:23] <jfewdibfuerwi> wait
[15:06:28] <jfewdibfuerwi> Just wanna make this clear
[15:06:31] <duch_kazatel> right now I have #page-content-wrapper set to 250px and it's not doing any good.
[15:06:34] <jfewdibfuerwi> The frame is INSIDE the div
[15:06:40] <jfewdibfuerwi> and it's already 10%
[15:06:42] <jfewdibfuerwi> *100%
[15:07:04] <jfewdibfuerwi> The frame is NOT the parent container. it's not. It is inside  #page-content-wrapper
[15:07:09] <duch_kazatel> right - I'm saying you're doing this all wrong.
[15:07:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm not retarded - I can read.
[15:08:37] <jfewdibfuerwi> so i can't do as you said... because the frame is 100% of the height...
[15:08:47] <jfewdibfuerwi> it's the parent which gets too big
[15:08:57] <duch_kazatel> you can, but that's exacerbating a problem.  the parent is not the issue.  the
[15:09:02] <jfewdibfuerwi> ..... when the radio gets shown (with bootstrap) i find no other way to fix that
[15:09:06] <duch_kazatel> *the #collapseChat or .frame1 is what you want to edit.
[15:10:11] <jfewdibfuerwi> okay man let's leave this css problem, i don't wanna kill you :D so........ can you just tell me why this code http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js  isn't getting executed with the event??
[15:10:17] <jfewdibfuerwi> just this which i cannot understand
[15:10:31] <jfewdibfuerwi> i mean, i followed bootstrap doc
[15:10:36] <jfewdibfuerwi> where's the error?
[15:10:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:10:52] <duch_kazatel> your error is the CSS>
[15:10:58] <duch_kazatel> you're putting a hack on top of a hack.
[15:11:06] <duch_kazatel> link that JS file one more time and I'm ignoring you.
[15:11:30] <jfewdibfuerwi> isn't there a bootstrap channel on freenode?
[15:12:35] <grizly> jfewdibfuerwi: ##twitter-bootstrap
[15:13:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Szr9n/
[15:13:29] <duch_kazatel> this is the basics of what you want.
[15:13:34] <duch_kazatel> edit the heights as you see fit.
[15:13:59] <jfewdibfuerwi> thank you so much grizly
[15:14:24] <jfewdibfuerwi> i didn't want to break your balls here, bootstrap is not your field
[15:14:30] <jfewdibfuerwi> and it's better
[15:14:33] <jfewdibfuerwi> since it's totally useless
[15:14:41] <jfewdibfuerwi> and painful.
[15:14:51] <duch_kazatel> jfewdibfuerwi your shitty attitude and refusal to listen to other people's advice won't get you far.
[15:14:58] <duch_kazatel> don't monkeypatch; fix.
[15:15:06] <xqo> how can i make a local image-file the background of <body>? http://jsfiddle.net/N6g92/1/
[15:15:11] <duch_kazatel> xqo you cannot.
[15:15:18] <duch_kazatel> you cannot read from the local hard drive like that.
[15:16:05] <xqo> i think you're wrong
[15:16:31] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20138001/reading-files-from-hard-drive-with-javascript
[15:16:43] <duch_kazatel> specifically http://stackoverflow.com/a/20138315/923919
[15:17:07] <duch_kazatel> think about why accessing files from the user's hard drive might be something that'd be prevented.
[15:17:25] <xqo> you dont need to access the file from your server
[15:17:33] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:17:43] <duch_kazatel> i think you're very confuse.d
[15:17:48] <xqo> you can fetch the local filepath using, and link to url(local_path)
[15:18:03] <duch_kazatel> correct.  you may not load that resource.

[15:22:05] <xqo> duch_kazatel http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[15:22:07] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  what sort of browser support do you need?
[15:22:56] <xqo> dont care very much yet
[15:23:14] <duch_kazatel> "yet" or "at all"?  because if it becomes important, you should care now.
[15:23:24] <duch_kazatel> http://caniuse.com/filereader is why i say that.

[16:17:40] <duch_kazatel> stfu
[16:19:17] <duch_kazatel> would wrong window.
[17:05:20] <CrazyZurfer> hi guys... why is that when copying jquery mobile's demo theme, the left menu goes down when in wide screen?? http://jsfiddle.net/p6K6t/
[17:06:49] <duch_kazatel> "the left menu goes down when wide screen"?  huh?
[17:07:44] <grizly> try expanding the window stupidly wide, the menu, instead of being a "mobile friendly icon requiring a click", becomes a list at the bottom left of the page.. odd
[17:08:10] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[17:09:19] <CrazyZurfer> yes
[17:09:23] <CrazyZurfer> that's what i ment
[17:09:26] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet it's a media query thing.
[17:09:47] <grizly> but there doesn't appear to be any media queries loaded, just jQuery 1.10.1
[17:09:48] <CrazyZurfer> but in the demo page works just fine, but here, I tried to copy exactly as is in the demo page, but no results :S
[17:10:07] <duch_kazatel> where's the demo page?
[17:11:05] <CrazyZurfer> duch_kazatel: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/
[17:12:03] <grizly> hehe, its literally designed that way.
[17:12:15] <CrazyZurfer> grizly: why?
[17:12:19] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah.  easy.
[17:12:19] <CrazyZurfer> how
[17:12:41] <duch_kazatel> .jqm-demos .jqm-navmenu-panel {position: relative;}
[17:12:44] <duch_kazatel> there's your issue.
[17:12:44] <grizly> Fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/p6K6t/1/
[17:13:01] <grizly> Its designed so on a desktop, the menu is visible, if mobile, the menu is hidden.
[17:13:09] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[17:13:18] <duch_kazatel> the positioning breaks in jsfiddle.
[17:13:39] <CrazyZurfer> let me see
[17:13:55] <grizly> I just bunged a max width on the parent div.. can never get wide enough to display the menu.. ;-)
[17:14:18] <duch_kazatel> grizly that doesn't work for me.
[17:14:34] <grizly> duch_kazatel: it works in the fiddle.. http://jsfiddle.net/p6K6t/1/
[17:14:35] <CrazyZurfer> doesn't work for me either
[17:14:50] <duch_kazatel> put it on its own page outside of a fiddle.
[17:15:04] <CrazyZurfer> ok, ill try
[17:15:12] <grizly> don't forget to load jquery
[17:15:29] <duch_kazatel> and make sure the document is valid - doctype, html, body, etc.
[17:17:56] <CrazyZurfer> grizly: doens't work
[17:18:29] <grizly> what?  What doesn't work.. where?
[17:20:09] <CrazyZurfer> doesn't work on my page, the content get's cutted and the menu goes down
[17:21:05] <grizly> Of course the content gets cut, that's all I changed.. set a max width.. its a style, the page is completely designed to NOT show that little menu icon when wide enough to display the proper menu..
[17:23:44] <CrazyZurfer> grizly: i know that.. the issue is that when the content has enough width.. the menu appears in the left... but the menu goes down to the bottom, and in the jquerymobile's demo, it doesn't happen
[17:24:52] <CrazyZurfer> grizly: have a look here: http://200.104.171.218/www/mishorarios.html
[17:25:02] <graud> hello, i want to assign a <span> some text using .text(), and i want to change the color of the text
[17:25:09] <CrazyZurfer> the menu is down there
[17:25:10] <grizly> In that case, you need to disable the Position relative call for .jqm-navmenu-panel
[17:25:17] <graud> and all appends and prepends have the original style
[17:27:22] <cronin> anyone ever use froala (http://editor.froala.com/)? new lines are wrapped in <div> instead of <p> and it's really annoying. can't seem to figure out how to fix it.
[17:28:08] <Korvin> cronin: I've had good experiences with redactor
[17:28:37] <CrazyZurfer> grizly: okay
[17:29:11] <cronin> Korvin: oh, that one looks nice. Can you try before you buy it?
[17:30:04] <cronin> Korvin: nm, I read the FAQ!
[17:30:32] <grizly> cronin: looks like the demo uses <p>, maybe its a config issue?
[17:31:14] <lethjakman> hey so I have a .on('click', function() { } )
[17:31:18] <lethjakman> how do I get self inside of that function?
[17:31:28] <grizly> lethjakman: $('this)...
[17:31:28] <lethjakman> as in the specific element that was clicked
[17:31:37] <grizly> grr..: $(this)...
[17:31:58] <Korvin> lethjakman: the HTMLElement is set to "this"
[17:32:10] <grizly> or, use the event: .on('click', function(e){ console.log(e.target); });
[17:32:10] <Korvin> if you want the jQuery instance, you have to rebuild it by doing "$(this"
[17:32:13] <lethjakman> ahhh it was my .data that was wrong
[17:32:14] <lethjakman> that makes sense
[17:32:17] <lethjakman> thank you
[17:33:11] <infecto> has anyone had any issues with jquery fadein operations on the more recent version of chrome?
[17:33:37] <infecto> the issues being the fadein change does not get displayed until resizing chrome or tripping through elements in dev tools
[17:34:11] <grizly> infecto: got a fiddle?
[17:37:10] <infecto> hmmmmmmm let me whip one up
[17:37:36] <grizly> its much easier to see the problem and help with a solution.. ;-)
[17:48:35] <infecto> grizly: Ugh wish I could replicate it in jsfiddle. happens on our production but hard to replicate it in a single fiddle. Happens on chrome not in firefox or safari hah
[17:56:06] <bowenac> If anyone has used waypoint.js can you look at this pastebin http://pastebin.com/4jRnPS3J
[17:56:29] <bowenac> I am trying to set a delay which works but now I need to delay for each of those targeted class names
[18:09:00] <grizly_> infecto: you can pm me a link if you want
[18:09:17] <AstonJ> Hi, is anyone here familiar with autocomplete and jsonp or cors? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22226302/cors-in-a-rails-app-for-jqueryui-autocomplete
[18:10:49] <duch_kazatel> AstonJ that's a big post.  what's your specific question?
[18:10:50] <grizly_> AstonJ: try changing the dataType to "jsonp"
[18:11:21] <grizly_> nm, looks like you did.. that is long though
[18:11:32] <duch_kazatel> try to distill the problem down a little more.
[18:11:50] <duch_kazatel> because basically jsonp is a way around CORS.
[18:12:53] <AstonJ> I can get a response back from the remote server (as reported in chrome dev tools) but I can't display the suggestions in the search bar
[18:13:48] <grizly_> AstonJ, have you got a link?
[18:13:51] <AstonJ> Would CORS be easier?
[18:15:18] <AstonJ> grizzly, unfortunately not as it is not shown on the live site yet, but I can show you a link to the rails app that is working www.breedia.com
[18:15:51] <AstonJ> (where it says search breeds)
[18:16:19] <AstonJ> (basically I am trying to add the same search onto the forum)
[18:16:35] <AstonJ> (which is in a sub-domain)
[18:18:07] <grizly_> Hmm, I assume you've read: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[18:19:30] <AstonJ> Yeah, the code I'm using is based off that, but I am a JS nubs, so don't really understand it
[18:19:38] <AstonJ> *nube
[18:20:42] <AstonJ> I think the bit that needs changing is 'success', and how it is displayed
[18:24:02] <AstonJ> Would CORS be easier? Someone mentioned it was preferable to JSONP
[18:24:34] <AstonJ> The response is coming back ok, it's just handling it.
[18:24:45] <systemfault> CORS is preferable...
[18:24:48] <systemfault> JSONP is more compatible.
[18:24:52] <systemfault> Pick your poison.
[18:25:10] <grizly_> How is the server issuing its JSON, because http://www.breedia.com/dogs/names?&featureClass=P&style=full&maxRows=12&name_startsWith=St&_=1394159060938 doesn't work.
[18:28:14] <grizly_> AstonJ: not sure if my post got lost above:  How is the server issuing its JSON, because http://www.breedia.com/dogs/names?&featureClass=P&style=full&maxRows=12&name_startsWith=St&_=1394159060938 doesn't work.
[18:28:57] <AstonJ> Try this: http://www.breedia.com/dogs/names?jsonp_callback=jQuery111001686675848904997_1394159314807&term=box&_=1394159314808
[18:29:04] <grizly_> got it: http://www.breedia.com/dogs/names?term=Sta
[18:29:11] <AstonJ> I changed the param to term
[18:30:02] <AstonJ> (Think that should be in the edited code in my SO quesrion)
[18:31:06] <AstonJ> Yeah it is... take a look at the second block, as that's as far as I got to get the response bring returned ok
[18:31:18] <AstonJ> *being
[18:32:56] <AstonJ> So I think the response is coming back fine, but the JS code needs tweaking (for instance, the demo code mentioned geonames and I obviously don't have any)
[18:33:18] <grizly_> AstonJ: got it: http://jsfiddle.net/EbUqP/
[18:33:28] <grizly_> Uses jsonp from your server
[18:34:10] <grizly_> You might want to look at typeahead though, populates browser localStorage for near instant searches.
[18:34:38] <AstonJ> Awesome - thanks :)
[18:34:54] <AstonJ> Do you want to submit it as an answer so I can make as accepted answer?
[18:34:58] <grizly_> AstonJ: had to change the "response" mapping function,  and the data "term"
[18:35:03] <grizly_> Sure
[18:39:29] <AstonJ> Would you know how I can make it 'go' once they make a selection grizly_ ?
[18:39:45] <AstonJ> (like it works on the main site?)
[18:39:58] <grizly_> Modify the "select" function
[18:40:31] <grizly_> , in this its: select: function( event, ui) ...
[18:41:09] <AstonJ> On the main site I use this:
[18:41:10] <AstonJ> 	    select: function(event, ui) {
[18:41:11] <AstonJ> 	      return $(this).parents("form").submit();
[18:42:26] <grizly_> You don't have to, you can use location.href = "/whatever/?query=" + ui.label;
[18:42:47] <grizly_> If you want to get tricky, start passing URLs with your JSON, then you can simply href to that..
[18:44:36] <grizly_> you might need the full url before the query..
[18:44:43] <grizly_> fiddle updated
[18:44:44] <grizly_> http://jsfiddle.net/EbUqP/1/
[18:45:53] <grizly_> Removed the pointless log function: http://jsfiddle.net/EbUqP/2/
[18:51:10] <AstonJ> Thanks, I was going to ask if there was anything we can strip away
[18:51:35] <AstonJ> I can't get the link to work on select for some reason : /
[18:52:33] <AstonJ> query string is usually: http://www.breedia.com/search?utf8=✓&query=box
[18:52:59] <grizly_> aye, you can add whatever you like to the query, its just a text string, you are only adding the part after: ...query=
[18:54:18] <grizly_> you might be suffering from X-Frame-Options errors, but that's because we are running it on jsfiddle, not your subdomain server, you will surely be linking to your own server right?
[18:55:22] <grizly_> ie: Refused to display 'https://www.google.com/?q=undefined' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'.
[18:55:44] <AstonJ> Yeah... I keep getting the same: http://www.breedia.com/search?&query=undefined
[18:55:52] <AstonJ>         location.href = "http://www.breedia.com/search?&query=" + ui.label;
[19:04:59] <grizly2> well.. I think I need a better modem for IRC..
[19:06:08] <AstonJ> ui.label not returning anything perhaps?
[19:06:09] <AstonJ> the forum is in a subdomain: forum.breedia.com the main site (which has this data) is at breedia.com
[19:06:09] <grizly_> stripped a bit more cruft, and yes, it was ui.item.label.. which isn't what they used in the example because they had a different map function
[19:06:09] <grizly_> http://jsfiddle.net/EbUqP/3/
[19:06:11] <AstonJ> AWESOME IT WORKS!! Thank you Grizly_ :-)
[19:06:12] <AstonJ> Btw, could you recommend any JS books for nubes?
[19:06:12] <AstonJ> I really do need to learn it
[19:06:31] <grizly2> weird
[19:06:40] * grizly2 needs to remember my nickserv pass
[19:07:15] <systemfault> AstonJ: Since you seem to have a good programming background... you could try "Javascript: the good parts"
[19:07:38] <systemfault> Or you could simply start eloquent javascript (online book) and skip whatever you already know
[19:08:08] <systemfault> Ah oop :P Took you for someone else by mistake :P
[19:08:10] <grizly2> systemfault: I'm looking that eleoquent up.. I need more JS practice!
[19:08:43] * grizly2 recognizes the irony of misspelling eloquent..
[19:08:55] <AstonJ> Thanks systemfault, I will look those up. I think I would like to start from the basics tho, in case I miss any important details
[19:09:21] <grizly2> AstonJ: try https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics
[19:09:58] <AstonJ> codeschool is awesome :)
[19:10:30] <systemfault> grizly2: Find yourself a small project.. Learn basic Javascript... then DOM.... then jQuery... then Promises
[19:10:58] <systemfault> A good way to learn how to use the DOM without jQuery: http://www.domenlightenment.com/
[19:11:28] <grizly2> cheers mate.
[19:11:31] <AstonJ> I love reading on my kindle, so books are really good for me
[19:11:57] <grizly2> AstonJ: http://www.klip.me/sendtokindle/
[19:20:00] <Velveeta> i just started reading bits and pieces of eloquent javascript 2 the other day
[19:20:32] <tw2113> does it make you feel like your code is vomit?
[19:20:40] <Velveeta> not yet :D
[19:20:58] <Velveeta> also, i was introduced to this page the other day... this sets up my whole reading list for vacation... http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/
[19:21:01] <tw2113> it's lying to you :O
[19:21:42] <tw2113> aww mr rmurphey made the list
[19:21:57] <Velveeta> mr. eh?
[19:22:05] <tw2113> :D
[19:22:14] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:22:40] <systemfault> Velveeta: Why would you even read eloquent javascript?
[19:22:50] <Velveeta> because it's part 2!
[19:23:04] <systemfault> OMG! So the dragons are coming?
[19:23:09] <systemfault> More explosions and stuff?
[19:23:26] <Velveeta> plus i think you find out that the dude was his dad the whole time
[19:23:29] <tw2113> systemfault, clearly Velveeta is reading part 2 because ****** dies in it
[19:23:41] <systemfault> NO WAI!
[19:23:45] <Velveeta> jesus, spoiler alert much?
[19:23:51] <Velveeta> ****** was my favorite character!
[19:23:59] <tw2113> everyone but us 3 saw astericks
[19:24:08] * grizly2 was looking forward to that dagnabit
[19:24:10] <tw2113> so everyone else is safe
[19:24:15] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:24:28] <Velveeta> so yeah, i've only been skimming part 2 because most of it looks like fundamental stuff
[19:24:38] <Velveeta> but i always hope i'll pick up a nugget of something i didn't know
[19:24:45] * grizly2 is trying to read it but getting distracted by work and IRC.. lol
[19:24:55] <tw2113> i still need to finish javascript ninja
[19:25:13] <Velveeta> i have an enormous list of followup articles in my chrome bookmarks
[19:25:17] <tw2113> i should probably finish some work, but IRC and beer is distracting me
[19:25:27] <Velveeta> things i come across that i don't want to spend the time to read at the time, but don't want to lose the link either
[19:25:28] <systemfault> So... is someone DDOSing Freenode again?
[19:25:51] <systemfault> Very netsplits. Such quits. Wow
[19:26:00] <Velveeta> systemfault: i just assumed there was a party somewhere that we weren't invited to... and everybody wanted to be prompt........ and also, they're carpooling..
[19:26:06] <tw2113> i never see join/part messages
[19:26:17] <tw2113> everyone's using the tardis
[19:26:25] <Velveeta> systemfault: my wife can't stand the doge meme :D
[19:26:37] <tw2113> i'm more a delorean traveler
[19:26:37] <systemfault> Haha, I hope she's not reading behind your shoulder :(
[19:26:59] <Velveeta> i got done w/ a workout one day and came to her and said "wow, so sweat, very exhaust, much tired" and she was like "i'm gonna ban that shit in this house"
[19:27:07] <systemfault> I use Colloquy like a n00b... been too lazy to find a proper IRC client for OSX
[19:27:10] <grizly2> lol
[19:27:36] <Velveeta> i used colloquy on my old work laptop, and then they gave me my new one about a month ago, and i've been running limechat since, and prefer it
[19:27:44] <systemfault> Velveeta: Haha, the english is not broken enough though in your sentence.
[19:27:50] <Velveeta> very true
[19:30:00] <Velveeta> http://dogeweather.com/
[19:30:47] <systemfault> much cold :(
[19:30:55] <systemfault> very cloud
[19:31:02] <Velveeta> very weather
[19:31:08] <Velveeta> such dark
[19:52:23] <jfewdibfuerwi> guys
[19:52:33] <jfewdibfuerwi> i don't manage to change a css property, dunno why
[19:52:47] <jfewdibfuerwi> I enabled console.log
[19:53:12] <jfewdibfuerwi> $('#page-content-wrapper').css('height', variable)
[19:54:24] <jfewdibfuerwi> http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/
[19:54:28] <jfewdibfuerwi> http://bovore.altervista.org/nontoccare/js/nannes.js
[19:57:51] <grizly2> jfewdibfuerwi: it's set on my version.. where are you seeing it "not set"?
[19:58:20] <jfewdibfuerwi> well, i compare the value of "diff" with the height of the elementç they're not equal
[20:01:09] <grizly2> diff is height -50px
[20:04:45] <jfewdibfuerwi> minus?
[20:04:51] <jfewdibfuerwi> no.. look at the console
[20:07:18] <grizly2> console.log(
[20:07:18] <grizly2> "Body: " + $('body').height() +
[20:07:19] <grizly2> ", NavBar: " + $('.navbar').height() +

[20:07:19] <grizly2> );
[20:08:29] <grizly2> On mine: Body: 650, NavBar: 50, Content-Wrapper: 600
[20:08:36] <grizly2> Perfect
[20:10:51] <jfewdibfuerwi> uhm not perfect
[20:11:01] <jfewdibfuerwi> content-wrapper should be 100px less than the body
[20:11:07] <jfewdibfuerwi> because
[20:11:42] <jfewdibfuerwi> #wrapper   is 50px more than #page-content-wrapper        AND   50px less than body
[20:13:10] <jfewdibfuerwi> oh i probab ly found out the error
[20:13:23] <jfewdibfuerwi> a space between  the value AND 'px'
[20:13:24] <jfewdibfuerwi> lol
[20:16:18] <grizly2> that certainly changes things.. there is supposed to be a green bar at the bottom then.. lol
[20:17:01] <jfewdibfuerwi> nuoooh
[20:17:08] <jfewdibfuerwi> thatàs a little problem i'm fixing now :D eheh
[20:21:28] <cprodigy29> When I figure this workflow out I'm definitely writing a guide lol
[20:22:10] <jfewdibfuerwi> done.
[20:22:25] <jfewdibfuerwi> what workflow cprodigy29
[20:22:43] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: I'm trying to build a mobile app using rails as a backend
[20:22:56] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: I've googled for hours.. everything is outdated
[20:23:08] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: but I'll figure it out sooner than later
[20:23:10] <jfewdibfuerwi> nice
[20:23:16] <jfewdibfuerwi> mobile app for which system?
[20:23:24] <jfewdibfuerwi> ios, android, win?
[20:23:25] <cprodigy29> cordova
[20:23:32] <cprodigy29> so all lol
[20:23:33] <jfewdibfuerwi> cordova_ wth is it :O
[20:24:01] <cprodigy29> have you heard of phonegap
[20:24:01] <cprodigy29> ?
[20:25:13] <jfewdibfuerwi> nope
[20:25:20] <jfewdibfuerwi> i'll better make a search
[20:25:53] <jfewdibfuerwi> oh nice
[20:26:01] <jfewdibfuerwi> it's a firefoxos-like app building
[20:27:46] <jfewdibfuerwi> cprodigy29: ghghghggh still not working on firefox :/
[20:28:03] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: lol
[20:28:46] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: there are a few out there like it but it allows you to develop  in html5, javascript, and css3 while being able to target native features
[20:29:03] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: then it compiles it to a platform of your choice
[20:29:09] <jfewdibfuerwi> yo nice
[20:29:21] <jfewdibfuerwi> the problem is that's from Adobe Corp
[20:29:27] <jfewdibfuerwi> Nothing good.
[20:29:30] <jfewdibfuerwi> lol ;D
[20:29:38] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: right.. they took over the phone gap project
[20:29:48] <cprodigy29> jfewdibfuerwi: apache has the cordova side
[20:49:44] <luvmyh0nda> back: [reason: Idle after 10h][gone: 9h51m50s][]
[21:13:05] <cprodigy29> if i have a front end js page linked to a backend app when I authenticate does it make sense to pass a token to the client so the server knows it's authenticated?
[21:17:18] <jfewdibfuerwi> jQuery ** How can I change the height of an element choosing the side which has to move (top instead of bttom, or the opposite)
[21:48:35] <grizly2> jfewdibfuerwi: what exactly do you mean? Do you have a fiddle demonstrating your scenario?
[21:57:15] <jfewdibfuerwi> nothing, it's impossible, i found another way
[21:57:49] <jfewdibfuerwi> you know, i want to have the haight-change  just as it was a "top" or "bottom" property change
[21:58:00] <grizly2> ahh.. :)
[21:58:13] <jfewdibfuerwi> grizly2: so that the only side which is seen moving is the top or the bottom
[21:58:18] <jfewdibfuerwi> but... yeah
[21:58:20] <jfewdibfuerwi> :D
[21:58:28] * jfewdibfuerwi brb
[23:08:22] <Macaveli> What's that called again that you have a + and your press it
[23:08:24] <Macaveli> and it opens
[23:08:27] <Macaveli> stuff
[23:20:35] <jop008> Anyone used this http://baymard.com/labs/country-selector?
[23:41:10] <Macaveli> for query icons what do I need to add, I've already added the classes
[23:41:55] <Cork> Macaveli: you need the css resources and the class names
[23:41:58] <Cork> that is it
[23:42:10] <Macaveli> Cork where to get it?
[23:42:23] <Cork> from the jquery ui package
[23:43:14] <Cork> Macaveli: if you have the css loaded <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-check"></span> should work
[23:43:22] <Cork> (doesn't need to be a span)
[23:54:33] <jop008> Can anybody help on this http://jsfiddle.net/69uWh/5/ on desktop browsers fine but unstable on iPad
[23:54:51] <fabioportieri> my agency is complaining that i work too fast and i should chitchat more with the coworkers.. and go to lunch with them (1hr lunch break) instead of working..
[23:54:56] <jop008> The target is a multi select box
[23:55:21] <jop008> I've tried many plugins but no one is satisfying
[23:55:30] <Cork> fabioportieri: be happy as long as it lasts
[23:55:43] <Macaveli> Cork any idea why I'm not seeing my hello text <h3 class="headingSmall clickable" id="FRO_REQ_ADD_FUNCTIONAL_AREA_LB"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-arrowthick-1-n">hello</span></h3>
[23:56:01] <fabioportieri> Cork: actually, that pissed me off so much..
[23:56:05] <Cork> Macaveli: cause the span holds the icon
[23:56:12] <Cork> Macaveli: so it has a fixed dimension
[23:56:38] <Cork> fabioportieri: they will eventually nag you that it doesn't go fast enough
[23:56:39] <Macaveli> Cork, so how to combine the hello with the icon?
[23:56:43] <Cork> it always ends like that
[23:56:54] <Cork> Macaveli: put the text after the span
[23:57:38] <Macaveli> Cork that works but it's shown on the next line than
[23:57:41] <fabioportieri> i'll make sure to apologize deeply for that, and promise that will never happen again
[23:58:02] <Cork> Macaveli: then you have something setting display: block; on the span or something
[23:58:09] <Cork> Macaveli: do you have a testcase?
[23:58:12] <Cork> (jsfiddle.net)
[23:58:23] <Cork> fabioportieri: heh
[23:58:25] <Macaveli> Cork, nowp sorry code is in Rails
[23:58:25] <Cork> ya...
[23:58:42] <Cork> Macaveli: you can still take the generated html and put in fiddle
[23:58:54] <Macaveli> Hold on
[23:59:48] <jop008> If I run this code http://jsfiddle.net/69uWh/5/ on desktop safari it is okay but not on mobile safari
[23:59:53] <jop008> any gues?
