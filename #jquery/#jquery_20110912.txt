[00:23:44] <Lundy> :( havnt got a clue wots up with this..
[00:23:52] <simonleojung> Lundy: you're using both shorthand .ready and .ready in your code, you only need to use one or the other
[00:27:13] <Lundy> when I even do 			$(document).ready(function(){					$("#dob").mask("99/99/9999", {placeholder: " "});						});	 I get the $("#dob") is not a function
[00:29:04] <nathanb> is there a way to capture what element you are scrolling on ?
[00:29:35] <nathanb> eg I have a div with a scroll bar, but I can't figure out what object to attach to the scroll event to do some stuff
[00:29:54] <simonleojung> Lundy: there might be something wrong in your custom js file, my fiddle of your code does work for me http://jsfiddle.net/simonjung/vKtDr/
[00:36:05] <nathanb> zz dw, I wasn't attaching it to the object after the document was ready lol

[01:05:06] <safzouf> Hello
[01:05:12] <safzouf> who used tipzoom ?
[01:05:30] <safzouf> I am facing a bug on it
[01:07:22] <PrinceES> i am having problem for displaying the title on thumbail image. but it doesnt seem to work http://jsfiddle.net/hVmWS/
[01:07:31] <PrinceES> please help me out
[01:07:34] <juha_> safzouf: you should fix it and release the fix
[01:07:37] <PrinceES> thanks in advance
[01:07:47] <safzouf> yes
[01:07:55] <safzouf> If I could, why not
[01:08:03] <safzouf> but it's defect
[01:08:10] <safzouf> that affect other elements of the page
[01:08:16] <safzouf> it makes disorder in the header
[01:08:25] <juha_> do they share a selector?
[01:08:27] <safzouf> this does not make sense
[01:08:30] <safzouf> nn
[01:08:43] <PrinceES> i only want to display the title over the thumbnail images.... well.. i am using jcarouselplugin
[01:08:58] <juha_> PrinceES: $("img").attr("title");
[01:09:05] <juha_> ?attr @ PrinceES
[01:09:06] <bot-t> PrinceES, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[01:09:27] <PrinceES> thanks
[01:12:13] <PrinceES> is not there any way through blind this title on the server scripting side... which means through css?
[01:13:28] <ravenzz> code?
[01:13:58] <PrinceES> http://jsfiddle.net/qy7zQ/ please have a look on it
[01:14:36] <PrinceES> here i am using foreach funtion and then passing the title....
[01:15:08] <PrinceES> I just want to do something through css that helps me to display each thumbnail title over the thumbnail image
[01:15:35] <ravenzz> k
[01:15:54] <ravenzz> that is a css related Q
[01:16:02] <ravenzz> anyway, hold on
[01:16:09] <PrinceES> :) thanks
[01:16:45] <PrinceES> i was also trying to find if there is any parameter exist in jcarousel but it doesnt
[01:16:59] <PrinceES> for this kind of job
[01:17:20] <ravenzz> you should take a look at the jCarousel doc
[01:17:30] <ravenzz> Is that an horizontal or vertical carousel?
[01:17:53] <PrinceES> vertical
[01:18:22] <PrinceES> i am using the same code which you may look on this example....http://www.queness.com/resources/html/jcarousel/index.html
[01:22:48] <maxw> hi - I'm using the jqm scrollView and am wondering what is the purpose of the 'options'. Are they just member variables or are they for the user to adjust?
[01:24:06] <ravenzz> PrinceES something like this http://pastebin.com/m5PgWeBY
[01:24:53] <ravenzz> and you should move the title (the span) inside the a element
[02:14:07] <new2net> is anyone familiar with this haunting mess? I think it may be jquery related  http://pastebin.com/2tEEXdxK

[02:35:34] <Godfather_> hi
[02:35:41] <Merbster> Does callback funtions in for example $.get() require anonymous functions as callbacks before data will return something else than "undefined"
[02:36:24] <Merbster> I have been trying with a functioN I defined elsewhere in my code and passed as param, and the function gets called. But the data var is allways undefined.
[02:36:36] <Godfather_> is possibly to start sentences with jquery after an specific function ? for example $(document).ready(function (){  .. } those senteces starts after the page is loaded, i want to do some senteces after myFunction() is executed
[02:36:53] <Godfather_> exists anything like  this? on function.ready ?
[02:38:54] <Merbster> Godfather_, I am new to jq, but I think you can chain as many jquery functions as you like. But I am not entirely sure.
[02:39:20] <Godfather_> Merbster, using callback you mean?
[02:39:28] <Merbster> yes
[02:39:44] <Godfather_> well, im sure there is other way to do it...
[02:53:11] <amcsi_work> hello
[02:54:03] <amcsi_work> aren't all $(window).load(fn) functions supposed to be guaranteedly called after all $(fn) functions?
[03:00:50] <amcsi_work> or what is the event for everything loading then?
[03:11:11] <xertion> Hi guys. Im new to Javascript. Is it normal to mix "Javascript" with jQuery? Im working on a script connecting to a Google API and from the examples there is normal javascript. If I want to add ajax-functionality to it, is it OK to just start typing in jQuery or is that wrong way to go?
[03:13:36] <amcsi_work> sure. jquery is basically just another javascript object, with a bunch of functions. It doesn't change the language in any way.
[03:14:27] <amcsi_work> it gives you 2 additional variables: $ and jQuery, which both point to the same function object
[03:15:21] <nail_> jQuery _is_ javascript, so there's nothing wrong there
[03:16:44] <juha_> WOOT
[03:16:52] <juha_> it's javascript?
[03:22:31] <thanpolas> I tried this the other day and didn't work: var j = $('#element').find; j('#sub_element').bind(func); :/
[03:23:01] <waldmeister> .find() .. it's a function I think
[03:23:12] <thanpolas> yes
[03:23:30] <waldmeister> you only have .find;…guess it's a typo then :)
[03:23:42] <thanpolas> no typo, sorry phone
[03:27:07] <Godfather_> how can i delay this function 2 seconds before its exectued?  $('selector).val('<?php echo ... ?>');
[03:28:25] <waldmeister> setTimeout("$('selector).val('<?php echo ... ?>');", 2000); might work @ Godfather_
[03:29:33] <Godfather_> waldmeister, ok thx
[03:29:51] <Godfather_> waldmeister, and exists a method for when a function is executed do something?
[03:29:58] <Godfather_> not using callback
[03:30:17] <Godfather_> something like .ready() but not using $document
[03:34:00] <thanpolas> back, the concept was that i needed to bind events on several elements under one newly created "master" element. And this "master" element is created dynamicly... so i have to use .find() on the master element...
[03:34:27] <thanpolas> for this reason i tried to assign the .find func in a variable, which is typical js, but it wouldn't fly
[03:34:38] <quicksilver> thanpolas: that's not typical js.
[03:34:47] <quicksilver> it's certainly a typical misunderstanding of how JS works.
[03:35:12] <thanpolas> var func = function(){} isn't proper?
[03:35:19] <quicksilver> if you take a method like that and try to assign it to a variable and call it later as a function, it won't get a correct 'this' pointer.
[03:35:37] <quicksilver> var func = obj.blah; func(); // not the same as obj.blah()
[03:36:10] <thanpolas> i see, var func = obj.blah.prototype; func() ?
[03:36:22] <thanpolas> not same again
[03:36:37] <thanpolas> i'll try google closure's bind functions...
[03:36:44] <quicksilver> but this is so stupid
[03:36:46] <quicksilver> why bother?
[03:36:58] <thanpolas> it's the specific use case :/
[03:37:10] <quicksilver> why not just store the element, rather than the method?
[03:37:24] <quicksilver> var e = $('#element');
[03:37:34] <quicksilver> and then, later, e.find('#sub_element')....
[03:37:51] <quicksilver> if you really must have a function j, then you can use 'call' or 'apply'
[03:37:55] <quicksilver> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[03:38:05] <quicksilver> I really don't recommend using google closure's bind
[03:38:16] <quicksilver> until you understand how to program javascript yourself you'll just confuse yourself more.
[03:38:49] <thanpolas> that's what i did eventually, stored the element in a var and did j.find()
[03:45:51] <dave1984> Hi guys, im trying to break out of an each() loop using return false under a hover trigger but it's not working, any ideas - http://pastebin.com/tGd8FZ1L
[03:45:53] <dave1984> Thanks
[03:49:19] <Clorith> Is it possible to reference the current date of a datepicker element from another object? (I want to check what date is picked in a datepicker when a new tab is clicked in my .tabs() object)
[03:53:46] <xertion> Hi guys. This code http://pastebin.com/7r72phJi should output the returned value from the Google API stored in var location; however. This code is executed BEFORE the page loads. So the returned value only show up for 1 second before the page refreshes. How do I fix this? How do I make the code execute after the page has been loaded?
[03:54:00] <Clorith> o, goudn it :D getDate =)
[03:54:04] <xertion> $(document).ready? Where should I place that?
[03:55:38] <Clorith> xertion: enclose everything in it
[03:57:28] <xertion> Clorith: I did before, like this: http://pastebin.com/xbATLrK8 However; now nothing is returned or printed.
[03:57:32] <aaronmcadam> anyone using backbone here?
[04:01:39] <dave1984> is it possible to identify between a user click and .click() ?
[04:03:05] <discorpia> dave1984: you would probably want to hook another event instead, like mousedown or similar
[04:03:08] <Clorith> xertion: Looks right enough, anything in your console?
[04:04:12] <xertion> Clorith: "initialize is not defined"
[04:04:22] <dave1984> I'm looking at the event object see if a binded click gives one
[04:11:13] <thanpolas> xertion this doesn't make sense, you don't call initialize() anywhere in the pasted code
[04:11:35] <xertion> thanpolas: I called it in the HTML in the previous pastebin-link
[04:11:36] <thanpolas> (and you should)
[04:12:20] <thanpolas> well if you called it in html then it shouldn't exist a. because it's not in the global scope, b. because it's initialised after DOM ready event is fired
[04:12:49] <thanpolas> simply ommit it, just do "var geocoder = new google..."
[04:14:37] <xertion> thanpolas: I did do some changes to the code, however Im still stuck with the problem I started with; that the code is executed before the page loads. As you can see on this link: http://data.fuskbugg.se/skalman02/1bb6f5f8_index.html
[04:14:48] <xertion> If you type in a city such as "Stockholm" in the field
[04:14:54] <xertion> you see the coordinates for like 0,5seconds
[04:16:05] <aaronmcadam> dave1984: https://gist.github.com/399390
[04:16:34] <thanpolas> you need to have a 'return false;' in the form submit function
[04:16:42] <thanpolas> so that the form is not actually submited
[04:16:48] <aaronmcadam> I've not tested that tho dave1984, it was code ajpiano wrote ages ago
[04:17:17] <thanpolas> but that's not the problem i see...
[04:17:28] <xertion> ?
[04:17:45] <necrodearia> Outsides of jQuery.ajax({}) I set a variable to {} and inside jQuery.ajax({}) I populate the variable object with data, however, after parsing it, I cannot access the data and the variable still appears as {}.  Is there a way I can globalize the variable?

[04:17:53] <jiduvah> hello everybody
[04:18:50] <jiduvah> how the hello to I change the looks in jquery. I am trying to use css, but I am unable to set background-color:#000000;
[04:19:24] <necrodearia> jiduvah, $("somethinghere").css("background-color", "#000000");
[04:19:54] <jiduvah> necrodearia: will that do it dynamically?
[04:20:16] <necrodearia> jiduvah, It should.
[04:20:51] <jiduvah> necrodearia: I am still very new to jquery and can't figure out how to set it statically
[04:21:01] <necrodearia> jiduvah, Mind pastebinning your code?
[04:21:10] <jiduvah> well I am very new to html, css, javascript and jquery
[04:21:15] <jiduvah> yup will do
[04:21:31] <kalle2> how can i create variables from the data returned in an ajax call?
[04:22:40] <jiduvah> http://pastebin.com/sRy8CSLW     html
[04:23:35] <jiduvah> http://pastebin.com/6eQQambb css
[04:24:37] <xec> jiduvah: to select class="main" you need .main not just main
[04:24:46] <jiduvah> i tried that and still no change
[04:25:30] <jiduvah> I should probably mention that I am using jquery mobile within phonegap, but the problem I am having would still be the same
[04:25:59] <MoTiOnXml> would it be possible to use the mask widget along with the date-picker widget?
[04:26:13] <MoTiOnXml> i'm thinking of overlaying the input masking yet still providing the dialog-picker
[04:26:19] <MoTiOnXml> anyone tried that yet?
[04:26:31] <xec> jiduvah: what exactly are you trying to do? #000000 is black.. you get a black background, no?
[04:26:55] <natrixnatrix89> is it possible to find something similar to tinymce but intended for markdown?
[04:27:06] <jiduvah> xec I want a black background
[04:27:11] <jiduvah> but I am not getting one
[04:27:34] <xec> jiduvah: then we are missing something, i copypasted your code here: http://jsfiddle.net/THJz4/
[04:27:37] <dave1984> aaronmcadam: Thanks!
[04:28:16] <jiduvah> xec: ah ok nice tool
[04:29:06] <jiduvah> xec: I guess it must be something to do with me using phonegap
[04:29:22] <jiduvah> xec: as it seems the css is working
[04:29:30] <Chibby_> hi, could anyone please advise me how to correctly do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Chib/vkdgn/ - basically trying to replace the word Display with Helpdesk in all the selected <a> elements
[04:29:46] <jiduvah> xec: I need to go for food but thanks for helping me with that, much appreciated
[04:30:23] <xec> good luck
[04:32:03] <necrodearia> Is it possible to access variable data outside of $.ajax({ }) in which inside the variable is set but also before the jquery ajax call, the variable is defined, set to {} ?
[04:32:18] <xec> Chibby_: you can't do $(this) in there
[04:32:56] <Chibby_> yeah, i figured as much, but i wasn't sure what else i'm supposed to use in that situation
[04:34:26] <xec> Chibby_: http://jsfiddle.net/vkdgn/1/
[04:34:45] <Chibby_> each! thank you very much (:
[04:34:55] <xec> yw :)
[04:35:49] <xec> there's a typo in mine, a ) too much
[04:37:16] <xec> and i wasnt doing any actual replacement :P http://jsfiddle.net/vkdgn/2/
[04:40:34] <Chibby_> yeah i noticed lol, the rest was easy though d:
[04:43:24] <johnline3> is there an id equivalent for .hasClass ?
[04:44:02] <aaronmcadam> uh
[04:44:11] <Techdeck> $("[id='something']") ?
[04:44:12] <aaronmcadam> why not just do $(el).is('#id')
[04:44:14] <waldmeister> $('#id') ? or $('#your-element').attr('i')
[04:44:18] <Techdeck> oh, or that
[04:44:28] <waldmeister> .is()? cool
[04:44:37] <aaronmcadam> ?is @ waldmeister
[04:44:37] <bot-t> waldmeister, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[04:44:38] <dave1984> if($(el).attr('id') == 'foo')
[04:44:45] <aaronmcadam> ===
[04:44:46] <johnline3> right now i have this: if ($('body').hasClass('home')) {
[04:44:56] <johnline3> .home has become #home in my html
[04:44:57] <dave1984> === :)
[04:45:19] <aaronmcadam> okkk
[04:45:27] <waldmeister> thx aaronmcadam
[04:45:31] <aaronmcadam> seems like there's a better way to do what u want but ok
[04:45:36] <xertion> I'm trying to figure out how I call a PHP function with jQuery. I got a php class with a test-function that retrieves data and then just returns it again. How do I call this function and send a string to it?
[04:45:43] <aaronmcadam> np
[04:46:13] <waldmeister> ajax @ xertion
[04:46:37] <xertion> waldmeister: ye but what functions? Im trying out $.post but I dont manage to get it quite right
[04:46:40] <xertion> im not sure it's the right
[04:46:42] <aaronmcadam> ?g jquery fundamentals @ xertion
[04:46:43] <bot-t> xertion, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[04:47:00] <waldmeister> luv that bot :)
[04:47:07] <aaronmcadam> look at $.ajax itself
[04:49:11] <dave1984> xertion $.get / $.post make it very easy
[04:58:12] <necrodearia> Is it possible to access variable data outsides $.ajax call in which inside the call variable data is set?
[05:02:27] <necrodearia> Ah, I must use $.ajax({async:false})
[05:03:03] <ThiefMaster|work> don't do that.
[05:03:13] <ThiefMaster|work> simply continue your code in the success callback
[05:03:36] <ThiefMaster|work> async ajax blocks the whole page (sometimes even the whole browser) until the request finished
[05:04:02] <waldmeister> sync ajax blocks, async is what it's supposed to be
[05:04:11] <ThiefMaster|work> err yeah
[05:04:13] <ThiefMaster|work> that's what i mean
[05:04:22] <waldmeister> but he's right..don't use async:flase
[05:04:25] <waldmeister> *false
[05:05:12] <xertion> dave1984: aaronmcadam waldmeister I did check out the ajax functions but I still dont understand how I use it to a PHP class with a construct and so on. Do you have any good examples?
[05:05:48] <waldmeister> the php class has to be in a php file and you need to call that file via ajax
[05:06:01] <peppux> ciao
[05:06:03] <ThiefMaster|work> xertion: ajax just performs regular http requests
[05:06:05] <peppux> hello
[05:06:35] <dave1984> xertion: you can call a URL using get or post, and also pass parameters to that URL as json objects
[05:06:39] <waldmeister> you can't use a php class within js, that's not how it works..you have to perform a http request to a website/php file which then handles the parameters you passed and returns something useful, e.g. formatted as json
[05:07:03] <peppux> someone can help me please?
[05:07:18] <waldmeister> what's the problem
[05:07:20] <waldmeister> ?
[05:08:43] <peppux> i've this code: http://nopaste.info/6697e62b4c.html
[05:08:54] <peppux> the ajax request failed
[05:10:04] <PrinceES> ravenzz> r u here?
[05:11:03] <waldmeister> peppux, does the php file exist? does it work without the data parameter?
[05:11:14] <peppux> waldmeister, yes
[05:11:19] <peppux> this is html code:
[05:11:34] <peppux> <form action='#' method='post' onsubmit='return create(this);'
[05:11:35] <waldmeister> 2 questions…which one did you answer? ;)
[05:11:41] <juha_> where's coldhead when i need him
[05:11:54] <peppux> waldmeister, yes all questions
[05:11:56] <peppux> sry
[05:12:11] <waldmeister> ok..so it works without the data parameter but not with it? then I think you got your problem :)
[05:12:41] <waldmeister> try removing the part before $frm_).serialize(). I think .serialize() doesn't return a string…but not sure
[05:13:00] <peppux> waldmeister, this is php file: <?php echo "test"; ?>
[05:13:18] <anli__> Hm, what is the way of getting the target from an event now again, is like $(target).what or something?
[05:13:26] <anli__> oops
[05:13:30] <anli__> $(event).something
[05:13:35] <waldmeister> event.target I think
[05:13:44] <anli__> not cross browser
[05:13:51] <waldmeister> event.findElement()
[05:14:15] <anli__> not cross browser either, ok, I do either then
[05:15:30] <anli__> I use a function that return $(typeof event.target != 'undefined' ? event.target : event.srcElement);
[05:15:41] <waldmeister> k
[05:15:43] <anli__> But I think jQuery has some easier way
[05:15:44] <peppux> waldmeister, can i print the ajax error request?
[05:17:47] <waldmeister> mmh..propably, yeah…try the error callback
[05:17:53] <waldmeister> just like you did with success
[05:19:18] <peppux> 		error: function(xhr, status, error) {
[05:19:18] <peppux> 			alert(status);
[05:19:18] <peppux> 		},
[05:19:20] <peppux> it's wrong?
[05:19:38] <peppux> this print only "error"

[05:22:22] <Nomikos> I KEEP forgetting this: how do I check whether a checkbox is checked?
[05:22:34] <Nomikos> is(':checked') doesn't seem to work?
[05:22:35] <peppux> waldmeister, nothing
[05:22:58] <waldmeister> .checked?
[05:23:06] <waldmeister> peppux, no idea then, sorry
[05:23:17] <peppux> waldmeister, if i use button it's work
[05:23:20] <Hopsy|2> Does someone need help?
[05:23:25] <peppux> but if i use the submit, nothing
[05:23:31] <waldmeister> what button?
[05:24:24] <peppux> input type='button'
[05:24:49] <Nomikos> waldmeister: nm, I was being an idiot (again)
[05:25:00] <Nomikos> is(':checked') works
[05:25:25] <fris> Nomikos or you could use attr or prop they all work
[05:25:54] <Nomikos> fris: yeah, the action part inside the if-statement was messed up

[05:35:39] <aaronmcadam> lunks you'd probably have to instantiate the plugin in a fixture
[05:36:01] <aaronmcadam> or just use $.fn.plugin or $.plugin
[05:36:04] <aaronmcadam> .method
[05:36:29] <lunks> $.plugin.myFunction?
[05:36:36] <aaronmcadam> aye
[05:36:40] <lunks> cool!
[05:36:44] <aaronmcadam> depending on how you're doing it
[05:36:54] <aaronmcadam> on how ur plugin gets called
[05:37:15] <aaronmcadam> but the func should be testable like that
[05:37:38] <aaronmcadam> I've not learned jasmine yet tho, so there might be a way to set a test fixture
[05:38:04] <lunks> my function would require to have state with stuff I pass to my plugin, that's what I'm concerned about, aaronmcadam
[05:38:37] <aaronmcadam> that's what test fixtures are for in test driven dev lunks

[05:38:46] <bot-t> lunks, Test fixture - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture
[05:40:29] <lunks> aaronmcadam: i know about fixtures, my issue is more on the 'calling a private function' problem
[05:40:39] <lunks> except that this is not exactly private, it's just wrapped inside the plugin
[05:41:03] <lunks> $.plugin wouldn't be called inside the object in DOM i want to interact with

[05:58:45] <ablomen> RubyTN, you have not defined id
[05:58:48] <ablomen> oh
[05:58:55] <ablomen> you want the id, make it "id"
[06:00:14] <RubyTN> ablomen:  thanks.  Its amazing what you miss when sleep deprived, LOL
[06:01:08] <aaronmcadam> lunks, the function definition will be in $.plugin tho
[06:01:22] <hekin> hi, guys, how to disable an option from a multi select?
[06:01:52] <hekin> say, i want the option to be <option value="1" disabled>Foo</option>
[06:01:57] <lunks> aaronmcadam: but let's say i've got some option being passed to the plugin, and I'm using it in the function
[06:02:09] <hekin> not <option value="1" disabled="disabled">Foo</option>
[06:02:11] <aaronmcadam> attr('disabled',true) or attr('disabled','disabled') hekin
[06:02:21] <aaronmcadam> that's the same thing
[06:03:10] <aaronmcadam> depends I spose
[06:03:17] <hekin> aaronmcadam, nope, they are different
[06:03:19] <aaronmcadam> what's stopping you creating a fragment
[06:03:37] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense
[06:03:38] <hekin> aaronmcadam, http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[06:03:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah so
[06:03:51] <hekin> take a look at, "Selected and Disabled Support
[06:03:51] <hekin> "
[06:04:04] <aaronmcadam> disabled is just html5
[06:04:07] <hekin> the disabled option is not "disabled = 'sisabled'"
[06:04:09] <hekin> aha
[06:04:11] <aaronmcadam> disabled="disabled"
[06:04:15] <aaronmcadam> is just xhtml
[06:04:24] <hekin> aaronmcadam, cool, thanks a lot
[06:04:37] <aaronmcadam> there's no real difference it should still be the same thing
[06:04:54] <aaronmcadam> otherwise that's a really stupid api decision
[06:04:56] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:06:03] <hekin> aaronmcadam, yeah, that makes sense
[06:06:38] <Marianne_> anybody ho has used jquery.wipetouch.js ?

[06:10:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:10:32] <aaronmcadam> are you testing it
[06:12:32] <Marianne_> $("body").wipetouch(
[06:12:32] <Marianne_> {
[06:12:32] <Marianne_>   wipeLeft: function(result) {  $("body").load("url here"); },
[06:12:34] <Marianne_>   wipeRight: function(result) { $("body").load("url here");  }
[06:12:36] <Marianne_> });
[06:12:38] <Marianne_> maybe load is the wrong way to do it?
[06:12:56] <aaronmcadam> are you sure it's not swipetouch?
[06:13:14] <Marianne_> no, I get it to swipe to other stuff, but not to different pages/posts
[06:13:51] <aaronmcadam> is the event firing
[06:14:07] <aaronmcadam> take out the load calls and just console.log() them

[06:29:13] <aaronmcadam> ah man
[06:29:14] <MoTiOnXml> but life moves on
[06:29:29] <aaronmcadam> guess so
[06:30:09] <aaronmcadam> posplaw: not without setting something based on events
[06:30:21] <aaronmcadam> which is probably what you're doing with your "big code"
[06:32:00] <posplaw> i made object called menu with some methods and method called Out for mouseout event of main menu button that sets timeout on self with 100msec within which there must be set subOver = true property set if it was moved to submenu, so if its not - the submenu fades out
[06:32:11] <aaronmcadam> bind( 'mouseover mouseout', function( event ){ if ( event.type === 'mouseover' ) { set the boolean var  } else { ...} );
[06:33:05] <posplaw> aaronmcadam no.. i need when mouseout of element triggers check out if the mouse right now over the other element!
[06:33:33] <posplaw> so if yes - this element still up, and if not - its being closed
[06:33:39] <aaronmcadam> lol my example was completely generic
[06:34:32] <pangel> is it possible to differentiate the kind of event that provoker a blur()? e.g. click, TAB, ESC
[06:34:40] <borisrorsvort> Can somebody help to understand why when i do $this.html().lenght is got undifined?
[06:34:50] <posplaw> aaronmcadam id like something like $(elem1).bind('mouseout', function(){ if($(elem2).mouseoverState == true){..} else{ $(elem2).hide(); } });
[06:36:32] <kborchers> posplaw: since you're already doing a setTimeout with your mouseout, do a clearTimeout in your mouseover of the sub menu to stop it from closing
[06:37:09] <aaronmcadam> kborchers++
[06:37:17] <borisrorsvort> Can somebody help to understand why when i do $this.html().lenght is got undifined?

[06:45:40] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah but it's still a bit early for him i'd say
[06:46:00] <aaronmcadam> ?doesn't work
[06:46:00] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[06:47:24] <SMut> aaronmcadam: THX again works now as expected ;-)

[06:49:47] <aaronmcadam> that won't work
[06:49:57] <aaronmcadam> you want input.classone.classtwo
[06:50:33] <jgspratt> how do I "install" something like the validation plugin?  where do I put the files? /javascript/...?
[06:50:37] <aaronmcadam> your selector there is saying "select an el with the class of classtwo that's inside an input with the calss of classone"
[06:51:02] <aaronmcadam> jgspratt: anywhere but it's a good idea to keep em in a js folder yea
[06:51:57] <jgspratt> aaronmcadam: what all has to go there?  just the jquery.validate.js or other files?  what about all the lib, demo, test, build files? the README.md wasn't particularly helpful.

[07:11:09] <aaronmcadam> a printer can't parse js
[07:11:13] <aaronmcadam> so it won't see it
[07:11:25] <kborchers> mike817: it's the next element in the selection, doesn't matter what it is
[07:11:28] <aaronmcadam> unless in your print.css you do #datatablecontainer { display : none }
[07:11:42] <mike817> kborchers: got ya. that's what i thought.
[07:12:07] <aaronmcadam> you can specify what the next el should be tho
[07:12:09] <aaronmcadam> mike817:
[07:12:16] <aaronmcadam> .next('.className')
[07:12:17] <kborchers> mike817: if you just say .next() with no selector, it will grab the next element in the dom
[07:12:31] <kborchers> with a selector, you can do ... what aaronmcadam just said ;)

[07:31:27] <apollo13> bcarr0505: check the css rules
[07:31:46] <apollo13> eg with firebug, looks like you have some other global rules strecthing it
[07:32:27] <bcarr0505> apollo13: I was assuming that, wasn't sure if there was anything known that causes it.  Alright, thanks :D
[07:32:45] <apollo13> bcarr0505: there might be something else, I am just guessing ;)
[07:32:53] <apollo13> (hard to say without seeing any source etcâ€¦)
[07:33:18] <bcarr0505> apollo13: Of course, but that was my guess too, I'll look into it more.
[07:33:23] <jgspratt> how can I use http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation to require at least one check box to be checked in a group of checkboxes?
[07:36:28] <ccmonster> morning folks
[07:36:31] <jaequery> hola
[07:36:43] * Madonna wants kinky badware plugins for jQuery.
[07:37:01] <jaequery> what do you do when your co-worker starts to go crazy with trying new frameworks?
[07:37:10] <jaequery> like, angular.js for instance
[07:37:33] <kborchers> jgspratt: you would need to write a custom validator method to check your checkbox group and return true or false
[07:37:48] <apollo13> jaequery: support it
[07:38:00] <jgspratt> kborchers: and then use http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/required#dependency-expression ?
[07:38:06] <ccmonster> i am going to shoot this crap ive written.
[07:38:24] <jaequery> apollo13, are you familiar with angular.js
[07:38:31] <Helbom> asher^: try this ... var isChecked = $('input:checkbox[name=mycheck]').is(':checked');
[07:38:52] <apollo13> jaequery: we looked at it but settled with knockoutjs
[07:38:53] <kborchers> jgspratt: that's probably not necessary
[07:39:03] <jgspratt> oh.  how would you do it?
[07:39:05] <Helbom> then use a true vs false if
[07:39:56] <apollo13> jaequery: but what I ment with my comment in the first place is that an open mind is always good, eg don't completly lock yourself in jquery just because it's jquery -- there might be frameworks better suited for what you need to do
[07:40:25] <jaequery> yes i agree to certain extent
[07:40:42] <jaequery> when we need to push new projects with deadline, i'm not sure it's a good thing
[07:40:58] <apollo13> right, that might get a bit problematic
[07:41:05] <apollo13> talk with him ;)
[07:41:09] <jaequery> with front-end, i don't see any particular problem as how it already is
[07:41:23] <ccmonster> So, I dont see why I can't overwrite page.State.region in this paste, http://pastebin.com/FNw22QVB
[07:41:33] <jaequery> html + js, works well without he MVC
[07:41:42] <apollo13> right, but as you say it it's subjective, so sit down with him and try to work out objective reasons
[07:41:46] <ccmonster> sorry for the sloppy code, im in the middle of debugging and logging out every last thing trying to understand what's happening.
[07:41:53] <apollo13> for you probably yes, for us no
[07:42:06] <kborchers> jgspratt: this is untested and very basic but something like http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/pVzpQ/ might work. then you apply it to all of the boxes in the group. only issue is if you don't want the error on all checkboxes, then you would need to handle that differently in your error handler
[07:42:22] <jaequery> apollo13, what is your reasoning for using knockoutjs?
[07:42:32] <ccmonster> I am trying to figure out what is going wrong on lines 23-43, speficifically.
[07:42:50] <apollo13> jaequery: none, it wasn't my decission and I was happy not to make it since I am the one with the least knowledge of js in the group
[07:42:53] <ccmonster> if the region param is blank, why can't I overwrite it back to the default.
[07:43:06] <apollo13> jaequery: but working through their tutorial is great^^
[07:43:22] <apollo13> (http://learn.knockoutjs.com/)
[07:43:31] <apollo13> kinda like jsfiddle
[07:43:33] <aaronmcadam> backbone++
[07:43:52] <apollo13> jupp backbone was one of the choices
[07:43:57] <aaronmcadam> tho knockout seems to be more of a "framework"
[07:44:11] <aaronmcadam> backbone lets you do whatever you want in whatever structure you choose
[07:44:12] <apollo13> backbone's routing stuff looked nice to me
[07:44:23] <apollo13> exactly, but obvoiusly requires more code as a result
[07:44:31] <aaronmcadam> not really
[07:44:36] <aaronmcadam> for me it's been handy enough
[07:44:45] <aaronmcadam> just wrestling with jqm's bugs n stuff
[07:44:57] <apollo13> agreed, I am not saying it's bad, it's always a question of what you need for one project
[07:45:06] <jgspratt> kborchers: thanks, I'll give it a try
[07:45:12] <kborchers> np
[07:45:24] <apollo13> knockout is kinda confusing me currently with namespaced binds; but that's due the lack of my js knowledge
[07:46:09] <jaequery> what do they offer you, better than just straight up html+jquery?
[07:46:15] <aaronmcadam> you're using an mvc framework knowing very little?
[07:46:19] <aaronmcadam> good luck with that
[07:46:20] <aaronmcadam> :P
[07:46:22] <aaronmcadam> crazy man
[07:46:43] <aaronmcadam> but at least you're learning js the right way, architecturally at least
[07:46:55] <apollo13> aaronmcadam: well I am mostly doing the backend server side stuff which is in python and rarely touch the js, but it still is a great learning experience
[07:47:06] <aaronmcadam> django?
[07:47:09] <apollo13> jupp
[07:47:13] <aaronmcadam> me 2
[07:47:14] <ajpiano> uhhh
[07:47:20] <ccmonster> any ideas why I cant overwrite the page.State.region property in lines 23-43?
[07:47:20] <jaequery> aaronmcadam, are you a fan of javascript mvc frameworks?
[07:47:22] <aaronmcadam> i'm the opposite to you
[07:47:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:47:27] <apollo13> ajpiano: hmm?
[07:47:39] <ajpiano> jaequery: backbone, et. al, are great
[07:47:44] <apollo13> indeed
[07:47:46] <ajpiano> they offer a consistent paradigm for structuring your code
[07:47:51] <ajpiano> and separating data stuff from view stuff
[07:47:52] <ajpiano> BUT
[07:48:00] <TeddyMurray_> hey, how do i do a callback function for a $.post() even if the post fails?
[07:48:07] <TeddyMurray_> ive tried .complete() but it says its unrecognized
[07:48:07] <aaronmcadam> ....?
[07:48:08] <ajpiano> you are correct that the *right time* to experiment with them is at the beginning of a project or in an experiment
[07:48:14] <jaequery> but i already have my own consistent structure ...
[07:48:20] <ajpiano> you don't just throw a little bit of MVC style js framework into a project that's about to ship
[07:48:38] <aaronmcadam> haha not without rethinking loads of shit
[07:48:41] <TeddyMurray_> lol
[07:48:50] <a|i> this 2 years old bug is back again in firefox 6: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4872
[07:48:56] <a|i> firefox = the new ie.
[07:48:58] <TeddyMurray_> ajpiano, are you familiar with .complete() ?
[07:49:05] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray_: complete is only on .ajax()
[07:49:09] <TeddyMurray_> ah i see damn
[07:49:12] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray_: you can do $.post().always(fn);
[07:49:16] <TeddyMurray_> sweet
[07:49:21] <TeddyMurray_> <3 ajpiano
[07:49:36] <a|i> so if you try to animate a flash object in firefox, it keeps reloading the flash object.
[07:50:03] <kborchers> ajpiano: really? i thought you could use $.post(....).complete(...); i have never done it but the docs say that :/ i always just use .ajax
[07:50:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah me too kborchers
[07:50:41] <ajpiano> you prob can
[07:50:46] <ajpiano> they should be identical
[07:56:07] <antihero> Hey, I get this error "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"
[07:56:21] <antihero> I'm using the jquery from google's CDN
[07:56:30] <TeddyMurray_> ajpiano, "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'always'"
[07:56:52] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray_: what version of jquery are you using
[07:57:00] <TeddyMurray_> ah ha
[07:57:03] <TeddyMurray_> good point :)
[07:57:05] <TeddyMurray_> 1.4
[07:57:13] <antihero> 1.6.3
[07:57:21] <ajpiano> lawl then that's why you don't have *any* of the dfd stuff working
[07:57:39] <ajpiano> antihero: that doesn't really make any sense, jQuery is defined but $ isn't and you're loading from the CDN
[07:57:59] <ajpiano> or is jQuery also not defined
[07:58:34] <kborchers> antihero: are you using a plugin that possibly uses noConflict?
[07:58:50] <antihero> kborchers: Not sure, I'll remove all the things
[07:59:29] <antihero> kborchers:  http://ixxy-mcdoogle.dapperdogstudios.com/ see that <--
[07:59:32] <BlackScorp> hey all i have a question to selectable function on jQuery UI http://jsfiddle.net/45MRk/1/ i want to select any of ul.second li
[07:59:36] <antihero> I didn't design it
[07:59:45] <antihero> All I'm using is HTML5shiv and PNGFix
[08:00:00] <BlackScorp> but it doesnt work
[08:00:22] <antihero> ajpiano: http://ixxy-mcdoogle.dapperdogstudios.com/ have a look for yourself :S
[08:01:16] <BlackScorp> anyone has idea how to solve my problem on http://jsfiddle.net/45MRk/1/ ?
[08:01:44] <antihero> oh man
[08:01:45] <Madonna> Would you use a web app that takes 30 seconds to load the first time you use it (there's a sexy progress bar)?
[08:01:50] <antihero> I was using href instead of src
[08:01:54] <antihero> >.<
[08:06:04] <antihero> damn, now jQuery.pngFix.js is causing a script error :(
[08:06:26] <ajpiano> antihero: don't use packed scripts, they're like so 2007
[08:06:33] <bcarr0505> Hey, does anyone know why my jquery ui datepicker is displaying incorrectly? http://minus.com/mbkIJSNQqp I have determined it is not a css issue.  Used jquery ui css only, and the issue still occurs.
[08:07:05] <lastent> Hi, I am making an instant search, so I set a bind on the on keypress event, but this triggers the event even if I press up arrow, is there any way to tell just trigger when is a char key?
[08:07:36] <ajpiano> bcarr0505: based on that screenshot, it's pretty hard to imagine that the *only* css on the page is from jquery ui
[08:07:50] <ajpiano> bcarr0505: are you sure there isn't some overly general rule that is affecting the width of tds, etc.
[08:08:31] <simonleojung> BlackScorp: is this what you wanted ? http://jsfiddle.net/simonjung/45MRk/2/
[08:08:55] <K1ng`> Its good to be back. :D
[08:09:09] <simonleojung> sorry haven't been in the chan long enough to hear the whole question
[08:09:40] <antihero> ajpiano: Okay.
[08:10:21] <BlackScorp> simonleojung: close i want to choose one of the li or the whole ul.second
[08:11:03] <BlackScorp> if i select Main 2 so all subs should be selected as well
[08:11:20] <BlackScorp> if i select Sub 2 in Main 2 so only main 2 should be selected but not main 2:D
[08:11:30] <BlackScorp> only sub 2 i mean
[08:11:45] <BlackScorp> its kinda grouped items
[08:11:50] <BlackScorp> i want to select a whole group
[08:11:53] <antihero> ajpiano: I'm not now and I still get errors
[08:11:56] <BlackScorp> or just one or more items in a group
[08:12:02] <antihero> IEtester is pain
[08:12:20] <antihero> lets try browserstack
[08:13:18] <antihero> yea it seems like jQuery.pngFix.js is what's breaking it !?
[08:13:37] <SicoWork> hey, just wondering if there is a performance difference between using .change() and .live('change') ?
[08:15:12] <ajpiano> antihero: try using dd_belatedpng
[08:15:15] <Madonna> Does jquery work well on IE 6?
[08:15:25] <ajpiano> Madonna: yes
[08:15:28] <snover> Nothing works well on IE 6.
[08:15:34] <ajpiano> as well as everything else does
[08:15:36] <ajpiano> ^^
[08:15:38] <Madonna> omg, awesome.
[08:15:53] <Madonna> oh lol
[08:15:59] <BlackScorp> simonleojung: somethink like :"Make ul.first > li selectable OR ul.second > li selectable"
[08:16:19] <johnline3> madonna?
[08:16:28] <johnline3> material girl
[08:17:40] <BlackScorp> http://jsfiddle.net/45MRk/3/
[08:21:45] <jgspratt> kborchers: one question: where do I add that code?  inside my $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[08:22:12] <jgspratt> or inside my .validate({?
[08:22:23] <Madonna> johnline3: I wank to the Material Girl every night and every day at work (my boss loves it).
[08:22:42] * Madonna goes to sleep at night with Madonna records in his arms.
[08:22:58] <johnline3> we are lieving in a material world, and i am a material girl
[08:23:07] <johnline3> HOLIDAY
[08:23:12] <johnline3> it would be so nice
[08:23:57] <johnline3> halt
[08:24:03] <johnline3> it time to poop
[08:24:07] <jugstah> got a question re: jquery... I have custom validation rules that execute on a select event.. but if i refresh or come back to that page, its not reloadi the rules
[08:25:09] <Madonna> johnline3: Some boys kiss me some boys hug me. I think they're okay! If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away.
[08:25:32] <Madonna> I love it when there's other Madonna fans here in #jquery. :D
[08:25:42] <gnarf> jugstah: you might need to trigger a "select" event on document ready
[08:25:48] <kborchers> jgspratt: you should be able to drop that in after you include the validator plugin but before you do .validate. probably outside of .ready
[08:26:21] <jgspratt> kborchers: inside <script> tags though?
[08:26:38] <kborchers> jgspratt: it is js isn't it? ;p
[08:26:39] <jugstah> ok..hmm
[08:26:46] <jugstah> jquery
[08:27:15] <jugstah> gnarf- after the page reloads, how do i trigger a select event to reload the rules again?
[08:27:26] <gnarf> ?trigger
[08:27:26] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[08:27:33] <jugstah> becuase right now, the rules are only triggered when selecting a value
[08:27:41] <gnarf> just after you bind it... trigger it
[08:27:45] <gnarf> or
[08:28:20] <gnarf> do like function setupRulesForThing(){} .... $("#thingy").select( setupRulesForThingy ); setupRulesForThingy()
[08:28:28] <jgspratt> kborchers: ok. so, I would add a rules: name: "checkboxGroup"?
[08:28:45] <gnarf> you can also do like .select( func ).select() to bind the select event then trigger a fake one to run the function
[08:28:46] <jugstah> gnarf- so I should move all of my conditional rules outside of the validate into the function?
[08:29:04] <jugstah> that way, i can trigger or valid on submit or refresh?
[08:29:27] <gnarf> jugstah: i really don't know - i'm guessing - seeing the code you're having problems with might help
[08:29:29] <gnarf> ?p
[08:29:30] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:29:41] <conanbatt> I am making an online gaming application , and for a user to see other peoples profiles i want him to be able to open a new window in a tab. Unfortunately, when i do window.open, chrome and FF make a new window! and also block it as a popup
[08:29:55] <conanbatt> is there a way i can handle a click as if it were an href?
[08:30:07] <jugstah> gnarf- i'll try and put some of this code up... you be around a bit?
[08:30:28] <gnarf> jugstah: maybe
[08:30:34] <jugstah> heh ;-)
[08:30:35] <gnarf> jugstah: but someone else can prolly help too
[08:30:39] <kborchers> jgspratt: you would do something like rules: { checkbox1: { checkboxGroup: true }, checkbox2..... }
[08:31:15] <gnarf> kborchers: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/496/files btw
[08:31:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gnarf37 (43m, 28s ago): 1.7 animate: allow named queues to be used by animate - fixes #9280
[08:31:24] <jugstah> this putting rules into a function is a bit new to me so if there's a howto page on this stuff that be nifty
[08:31:25] <conanbatt> as if it were an "a" link i meant
[08:31:28] <gnarf> kborchers: thats gonna be nice in 1.9 effects :)
[08:32:00] <jugstah> not sure if php code would work on jsfiddle?
[08:32:12] <kborchers> gnarf: oooooo, that will be nice!
[08:32:16] <gnarf> jugstah: php shouldn't matter..
[08:32:26] <gnarf> kborchers: the test make sense to you?
[08:32:52] * kborchers looks
[08:32:53] <gnarf> jugstah: like this is javascript...
[08:33:00] <gnarf> there shouldn't be any php in it right?
[08:34:22] <gnarf> actually i think i need to change that .interval to a flat ms number
[08:35:15] <jugstah> wtf, it wont let me paste..
[08:35:48] <Soothsayer> If I'm passing a key-value pair to the # fragment part of a URL, how should I encode the values? Using encodeURIComponent is of no use as firefox decodes them before javascript receives the value of the fragement where as Chrome / IE do not decode them.
[08:36:09] <kborchers> gnarf: i think it looks ok ... i hate looking at qunit and trying to think it through ;)  why change .interval?
[08:36:28] <gnarf> they might pull .fx.interval in 1.7
[08:36:46] <kborchers> oh, then yeah i would get rid of it then
[08:36:58] <jugstah> this is sloppy but if anyone wants a quick look in spite of the sloppy etc, here's the URL
[08:37:17] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/jugstah/QbwSs/1/
[08:37:46] <kborchers> gnarf: so when we gonna get this UI meetup going? been trying to think of a way to get people to come without signing up and paying for a meetup organizer account
[08:38:07] <kborchers> was also thinking we might get more people closer to me ... though i know that's probably hard for you
[08:38:09] <jgspratt> kborchers: are checkbox1, checkbox2, etc. name= elements?  or IDs?
[08:38:12] <jugstah> just look at the section in the js esp for ("#loan_type").change
[08:38:28] <kborchers> jgspratt: i think id's but can't remember for sure
[08:38:43] <gnarf> kborchers: we prolly would have more people closer to you :)
[08:38:44] <jgspratt> kborchers: because all the other rules are names
[08:39:00] <kborchers> jgspratt: hmmm, then must be names ;)
[08:39:06] <jgspratt> kborchers: and it would be so handy if they were names, because then I wouldn't have to write it out so many times
[08:39:28] <antihero> Grr, does jquery.pngFix have issues with JQuery 1.6?
[08:39:43] <antihero> In IE6 (where it's useful) it exceptions if there is actually a png on the page.
[08:39:48] <kborchers> jgspratt: you using the same name like checkbox[] or something to get an array on the backend?
[08:39:51] <antihero> which means that it isn't particularly useful
[08:40:11] <ajpiano> antihero: use dd_belatedpng, i've heard much better things about it
[08:40:30] <jgspratt> kborchers: I haven't written the back end.  it was only going to generate an email.  what would you recommend?
[08:41:04] <jugstah> gnarf- was my jsfiddle too messed up for you to look at?
[08:41:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah belated is good
[08:41:33] <kborchers> jgspratt: no need for the array then, you could just use same name and get a comma separated list on the back end
[08:41:34] <gnarf> ummm
[08:41:43] <gnarf> jugstah: i don't see any javascript?
[08:41:55] <gnarf> like i could care less about the html
[08:42:08] <gnarf> and i could really care less about the php
[08:42:09] * gnarf grins
[08:42:15] <jugstah> hehe
[08:42:43] <jugstah> gnarf- just trying to ensure that im doing thigns right to get a little help here :-)
[08:43:05] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/jugstah/QbwSs/4/
[08:43:14] <jugstah> the jquery stuff shd be there
[08:43:57] <kborchers> isn't there some law against finishing a pot of coffee and not making another? lazy coworkers!
[08:44:14] <jugstah> kborchers- get a tassimo or keurig :-)
[08:44:22] <gnarf> wow holy shit thats like way wrong
[08:44:27] * gnarf grins
[08:44:28] <aaronmcadam> lol
[08:44:35] <gnarf> okay like
[08:44:40] <aaronmcadam> i'm afraid to look now
[08:44:42] <gnarf> lets go through some really simple mistakes
[08:44:53] <jugstah> like i said, im a amateur :-)
[08:44:55] <jgspratt> kborchers: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pVzpQ/1/ ?
[08:45:03] <gnarf> first of all... everytime you do $("#something") you execute some code that "searches" the document for that element
[08:45:19] <gnarf> if you just did var something = $("#something");
[08:45:27] <gnarf> you'd never have to look for it again
[08:45:32] <gnarf> ?cache
[08:45:32] <bot-t> gnarf, Google Cache - Syntax: ? cache <url>
[08:45:36] <aaronmcadam> ha
[08:45:39] <gnarf> ?g jQuery cache
[08:45:40] <bot-t> gnarf, JQuery HowTo: Caching in jQuery - http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2008/12/caching-in-jquery.html
[08:45:54] <gnarf> boo
[08:46:00] <gnarf> whos article is the good one, anyone?
[08:46:12] <kborchers> jgspratt: seems about right all that's left now is see ?tias
[08:46:12] <bot-t> jgspratt, Try It And See
[08:46:41] <jgspratt> kborchers: right, I did.  no go.  I could pass the page without checking any boxes
[08:47:02] <jugstah> gnarf- directed at me or jgspratt? :-)
[08:47:10] <kborchers> jgspratt: try logging that selector in the validator to make sure it's working right
[08:47:56] <jgspratt> hmm, I forgot to escape some $s
[08:48:02] <gnarf> jugstah:all you
[08:48:14] <gnarf> jugstah: okay - a quick third pass reading of this code blcok
[08:48:42] <jgspratt> still no go.  ok, let me... how do you "try logging that selector"?
[08:49:19] <gnarf> jugstah: you're also calling .val() like 20 times more than you need to
[08:49:32] <jugstah> I'm sure I am...
[08:49:39] <jugstah> i'm learning jquery
[08:49:41] <jugstah> painfully
[08:49:42] <jugstah> :-)
[08:49:45] <gnarf> jugstah: same idea... selected = $( this ).val();
[08:49:56] <gnarf> if ( selected === "..." )
[08:50:24] <kborchers> jgspratt: console.log($( "input[name='" + $(element).attr("name") + "']:checked" )); before you return and see what comes out in firebug or chrome console
[08:50:40] <jugstah> console.log is the best thing since sliced bread
[08:52:10] <waldmeister> jugstah, I just wish it would work in IE as well
[08:52:26] <jugstah> wald- agreed
[08:52:30] <kborchers> waldmeister: it does
[08:52:40] <waldmeister> it does?
[08:52:42] <kborchers> hit F12
[08:52:53] <jugstah> kb- how? damn, i learn another trick today
[08:53:32] <gnarf> jugstah: other than the caching issues, you basically have the best I'd expect you to
[08:54:44] <jugstah> gnarf- so this is good, i just need to move some of the rules outside above the validate?
[08:55:02] <jugstah> and fix the caching?
[08:55:14] <gnarf> jugstah: no
[08:55:29] <gnarf> just add .change(); to the bottom of the chain
[08:55:43] <gnarf> $("#loan_type").change( superlongfunction ).change();
[08:55:51] <gnarf> its already in the doc ready
[08:56:03] <jugstah> ok so if i go to page 2 and then come back to page 1
[08:56:07] <gnarf> you bind the change func, and trigger it once right a way
[08:56:08] <jugstah> it forgets these rules?
[08:56:13] <jugstah> oh ok
[08:56:25] <gnarf> so on doc load it uses the rules from whats in the val
[08:56:30] <gnarf> or doc ready
[08:56:35] <Madonna> console.log fucked me over when management tested the site in Firefox 3.5
[08:56:39] <Madonna> FUCKED the demo
[08:56:39] <jgspratt> kborchers: I'm getting--> missing } after property list [Break On This Error] due_month: "required"
[08:56:47] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[08:57:08] <jgspratt> kborchers: I'm using http://jsfiddle.net/pVzpQ/2/
[08:57:15] <aaronmcadam> build process to remove console.log
[08:57:31] <jugstah> gnarf- where in the change do i readd .change();
[08:57:36] <jugstah> err, chain
[08:57:41] <kborchers> jgspratt: you need commas after each rule
[08:58:01] <jgspratt> oh.  except for the last one?
[08:58:05] <gnarf> jugstah: .change( function (){ ..... } ).change();
[08:58:22] <jgspratt> kborchers: and do I need to put "true" in quotes in audience: {	checkboxGroup: true } ?
[08:59:14] <Soothsayer> someone please suggest a good way to encode key=value pairs in the fragment part of a URL, for eg http://foo.com/#key=val&sex=male&url=how-do-encode-this&age=25

[08:59:36] <jugstah> gnarf - YOU RULE!
[08:59:42] <jugstah> TYTYTYVM!
[09:00:14] <jugstah> all i did was add the .change() and it now reapplies the rule after a reload
[09:00:19] <Soothsayer> ajpiano, I see. And how should these values be encoded? (cause they're going to encoded elsewhere)
[09:00:27] <enjoycrf> i used rsh history before it was a plugin
[09:00:39] <kborchers> jgspratt: no, true not in quotes, yes commas after all but last
[09:01:18] <ajpiano> Soothsayer: if you're manipulaitng the fragment on the client side, you should let the client side take care of encoding, i'd tend to think
[09:01:26] <jugstah> bookmarks that google caching stuff for further consultation
[09:01:28] <enjoycrf> jgsprat, experiment!
[09:01:49] <Soothsayer> ajpiano, but what's the encoding function used for the values?
[09:02:07] <ajpiano> not sure, i think it handles all that you need encoding wise
[09:02:09] <jugstah> what is the commonly agreed best dev environment to use? xampp or zend or something else?
[09:02:29] <jugstah> for php/jquery/mysql/sql on a windwos box
[09:03:21] <dreadpiratepeter> I'm having a weird problem with the jkey plugin. I have bound 'alt-letter' keys for various functions in my app. which work fine. However, frequently my app thinks that the alt key is pressed when it isn't, esp. when typing in input fields and textboxes, so it executes my handlers instead of inserting the char. anyone else experienced this?
[09:03:58] <dreadpiratepeter> oh, and behavior happens on both chrome and firexfox. haven't tested on ie
[09:04:12] <enjoycrf> jugstah ur all over the place
[09:04:21] <enjoycrf> mysql/sql?
[09:04:22] <enjoycrf> wtf
[09:04:44] <jugstah> enjoy- yeah we have multiple clients who use different environments
[09:04:55] <enjoycrf> try building out ur own framework
[09:04:58] <enjoycrf> ull learn alot
[09:05:08] <enjoycrf> jquery IS a framework
[09:05:13] <ccmonster> So I cannot seem to get this right on lines 23-43. my page.State keeps getting overwritten or something. It's Strange. http://pastie.org/2521700
[09:05:16] <enjoycrf> so ur set there
[09:05:25] <enjoycrf> but ull make some wrappers out of that
[09:05:39] <jugstah> enjoy- i still have a lot to learn so im buying a laptop to put my own shit on
[09:05:57] <enjoycrf> all frameworks will have limitations
[09:06:04] <jugstah> i can do basic jquery but the more complicated it gets, the faster gray hairs i have
[09:06:05] <jugstah> lol
[09:06:11] <jgspratt> kborchers: actually, it is working pretty well now, except for one thing: when I don't check a box, the message that I need to check the box looks like "Please select a checkboxProspective students"
[09:06:14] <enjoycrf> dont panic
[09:06:26] <jgspratt> which is right where the "Prospective students" message was
[09:06:33] <enjoycrf> best solution sometimes is to step away for a few hours
[09:06:56] <enjoycrf> try programming more in your head
[09:07:00] <enjoycrf> lol
[09:07:02] <kborchers> jgspratt: can you post your custom method again?
[09:07:04] <ccmonster>  Anyone know what I am doing wrong with regards to my page.State object?
[09:07:12] <jugstah> enjoy- then end up in the insane asylum? :-)
[09:07:19] <enjoycrf> naw
[09:07:26] <jgspratt> kborchers: sure: http://jsfiddle.net/pVzpQ/3/
[09:07:33] <enjoycrf> i build a 3d engine from scratch in 2 months
[09:07:40] <jgspratt> kborchers: and thanks a ton for your help with this.  its very educational
[09:07:46] <SicoWork> is there a performance difference between using .change() and .live('change') ?
[09:07:51] <enjoycrf> but a year earlier i gave up on the same thing
[09:07:58] <jugstah> enjoy- im a long way from there :_)
[09:08:09] <enjoycrf> ull see
[09:08:20] <jgspratt> kborchers: basically, what I'm wondering is this: how can I move that message?
[09:08:23] <enjoycrf> one day ull say wtf was i thinking or not lol
[09:08:46] <ccmonster> it seem seems like page.State.region is getting overwritten where page.State.region = ''
[09:08:49] <ccmonster> and I dont see why
[09:09:04] <kborchers> jgspratt: oh, i see. so you were expecting that prospective student bit but just not the checkbox message next to it?
[09:09:11] <ajpiano> ccmonster: maybe your comparisons are getting coerced in a way you don't expect
[09:09:16] <ajpiano> cause you're using == instead of ===
[09:09:16] <enjoycrf> i hear ZEND is a good framework for php
[09:09:22] <enjoycrf> i have my own
[09:09:24] <ajpiano> ?eval "" == false
[09:09:25] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[09:09:28] <ajpiano> etc.
[09:09:34] <enjoycrf> ive used some crappy ones tho like cake
[09:09:43] <jugstah> enjoy- you use ZEND? I have xampp and zend on separate machines
[09:09:47] <jgspratt> kborchers: well, the page has the "Prospective students" message right next to a check box, but that is the first of 8 check boxes
[09:09:56] <enjoycrf> and for php/mysql on windows id use WAMP
[09:09:57] <jugstah> can't decide which is the best but i like xampp portable so far
[09:09:58] <jgspratt> kborchers: and "Please select a checkboxProspective students" is kind of garbeled
[09:10:07] <enjoycrf> itll have ur server up
[09:10:11] <enjoycrf> in a few clicks
[09:10:22] <opius> can anyone have a quick look why i get "unexpected token: }" http://jsfiddle.net/3cXbQ/
[09:10:26] <jugstah> wampp? i'll have to check that out
[09:10:28] <ccmonster> ahh... so in that case I want to do ===
[09:10:36] <jgspratt> kborchers: I could handle "Prospective students <-- Please select a checkbox"
[09:10:47] <enjoycrf> as far as mysql and sql
[09:10:55] <ajpiano> opius:  you have mistmatched brackets and parens
[09:11:02] <enjoycrf> most frameworks will support both with a simple switch
[09:11:23] <enjoycrf> and u can convert the data w navicat
[09:11:31] <enjoycrf> or similar
[09:11:51] <jugstah> ill only use one or the other depending on the job's requirements
[09:11:52] <kborchers> jgspratt: you'll probably need to look into the errorPlacement option then. you can customize where every error message is placed
[09:12:16] <jugstah> you can customize the error message placement without using that errorPlacement stuff
[09:12:37] <enjoycrf> id suggest getting on LINUX
[09:12:45] <jugstah> <div id="id-error">
[09:12:45] <jugstah> <label for="loan_joint" class="error" generated="true"></label>
[09:12:47] <jugstah> </div>
[09:12:57] <jugstah> rename for to the same name as the field being validated
[09:13:28] <jugstah> enjoy- i can use my fbsd box in that case but im putting a dev env on a windows laptop
[09:15:37] <opius> ajpiano, ahh damnit.. i think i need a coffee break, can't spot the mismatch :)
[09:16:04] <ajpiano> lol
[09:16:26] <ajpiano> imagine if they had editors that did bracket matching for you
[09:16:42] <ajpiano> also code doesn't need empty else {}
[09:16:52] <opius> i found it :)
[09:18:31] <jugstah> thinking about getting this laptop since its on sale and cheap
[09:18:42] <jugstah> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/HP+-+Pavilion+Laptop+/+AMD+Phenom%26%23153%3B+II+Processor+/+17.3%22+Display+/+4GB+Memory+/+500GB+Hard+Drive+-+Pewter/2881467.p?id=1218359112138&skuId=2881467
[09:19:41] <enjoycrf> empty else lol
[09:20:09] <enjoycrf> get the macbook air
[09:20:33] <jugstah> dont have a kidney to sell for a macbook air
[09:20:34] <jugstah> lol
[09:20:37] <enjoycrf> but hp made a really good laptop w 2 fans a few years ago
[09:20:52] <enjoycrf> it was like a desktop laptop
[09:21:01] <enjoycrf> i like those caues u can game on the,
[09:21:02] <enjoycrf> m
[09:21:22] <jugstah> i rarely game on a laptop; always on a desktop
[09:21:44] <jugstah> damn laptops would give me DIMMs :-)
[09:21:55] <enjoycrf> my alienware lap got stolen
[09:22:00] <enjoycrf> :(
[09:22:03] <jugstah> oooh, alienware is sweet
[09:22:05] <enjoycrf> but i beat it
[09:22:11] <jugstah> a bit rich tho
[09:22:13] <enjoycrf> it was all cracked
[09:22:22] <enjoycrf> but still worked a lil
[09:22:46] <jugstah> thinking im gonna head over and see if they have the laptop in stock
[09:24:05] <jugstah> for the price, its a decent deal
[09:24:07] <enjoycrf> jeez most laptops are practicly free
[09:24:12] <enjoycrf> compared to mac air
[09:24:32] <enjoycrf> mac air is pure sickness tho
[09:24:43] <enjoycrf> i can probly hide one up my ass
[09:24:52] <jugstah> lol
[09:24:56] <jugstah> too rich for me, again
[09:25:12] <enjoycrf> ohh is that a mac air in ur ass?
[09:25:26] <enjoycrf> yeah i smuggled it
[09:25:30] <jugstah> if i wanted a mac-anything, i'd get the ipad2
[09:25:31] <jugstah> that's sick
[09:25:46] <enjoycrf> u cant code on ipad
[09:25:53] <jugstah> true that
[09:25:55] <jugstah> ;-)
[09:26:12] <enjoycrf> even the air is not so realistic w 13 in
[09:26:26] <jugstah> for 17" this laptop im looking at is cheap
[09:26:37] <jugstah> and is perfectly fine for email/coding/web browsing etc
[09:26:40] <jugstah> nothing fancy
[09:26:44] <opius> $('hiddenDel" + i + "').click(); this is wrong right? (hiddenDel beeing a button)
[09:26:49] <jugstah> i refuse to look at anything less than 17"
[09:27:07] <bot-t> jugstah, <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[09:27:17] <jugstah> ?
[09:27:42] <ajpiano> ?twss
[09:27:43] <bot-t> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[09:27:45] <jugstah> ok bbiaw

[09:33:15] <WebDragon> finally figured out last night with the help of #jquery that it was the cufon fonts that were preventing the â‡² from appearing next to the menu section headers at first page load, and switched them off and went to google @font-face webfonts
[09:33:31] <WebDragon> only now I've got some jaggies on windows browsers (any kind) and am looking into wtf
[09:33:51] <WebDragon> this has been never-ending. fix one broken thing and something else breaks
[09:34:07] <WebDragon> I'm running out of facepalm. gone through six cans of the stuff already
[09:34:10] <WebDragon> xD
[09:34:14] <ajpiano> :/
[09:35:50] <WebDragon> didn't help that so much had changed under the hood with wordpress since the last time I played with it
[09:36:08] <WebDragon> at least jquery's been solid as a rock the whole time :) [FINALLY SOMETHING I CAN RELY ON]
[09:36:53] <enjoycrf> yeah i havent had any problems w jquery
[09:37:40] <Helbom> me neither for the 5 days i've been messing with it :)
[09:37:49] <lastent> Hi I am returning the keyCode of an keypress event, and when I press "Ã±" it is returning 0, but that is not the code of "Ã±"
[09:38:01] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[09:38:15] <WebDragon> got one whacky issue with scripting but I don't believe it's jquery -- something else the author's done. perhaps re-ordering some of his scripts would prevent the breakage in inserting images/content with the media uploader

[10:17:04] <danagin> I'm having some issues. This is pulled from the rendered page source, and it doesn't work. I have the script in line, but I've also put it in the head...
[10:17:05] <danagin> http://pastebin.com/K9xMpRK9
[10:17:07] <enjoycrf> LA lala LA loooo
[10:20:33] <kborchers> danagin: doesn't work is a little vague. are you getting an error? gonna need a little more info
[10:21:29] <danagin> no error, I'm simply trying to debug why this won't run, I just want the alert to pop up at this point, issues go much deeper, but if I can get the click to invoke the alert...
[10:21:57] <danagin> "this point" when the button id=toggle is clicked
[10:22:05] <marcuslind> What's the operator in jquery equal to PHP's .= ? Ex: $("#id").text("Hello World!"); replaces what was in #id before. I want to keep the old and ADD new text, not REPLACE.

[10:31:15] <jugstah> wank wank
[10:38:39] <cafaro> Is there something in  jQuery that allows to temporarily disable a click event (for an ajax link), or do I have to keep an array (I'm using multiple ajax links) to keep track of this? Or maybe there's even a better way of doing this? Thanks!

[10:59:27] <snowfox_ben> member:marcuslind: bind, or live
[10:59:43] <marcuslind> snowfox_ben: pl0sh what do you mean? Im new, please explain.
[11:00:10] <snowfox_ben> marcuslind: See http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:00:10] <pl0sh> marcuslind: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[11:00:25] <pl0sh> bind or live...
[11:00:48] <pl0sh> i think live would fit better for the <a> element..
[11:01:16] <pl0sh> snowfox_ben: can you help me with this issue? http://jsfiddle.net/5NLfP/1/
[11:01:48] <pl0sh> nm, I fixed it :D

[11:07:34] <jugstah> we need a buffer between us coding guys and the idiots that maintain corporate websites but have no clue how to do html/css or anything else for that matter
[11:14:11] <sanduz2> is string data the only type of data jquery.ajax() will accept as return data?
[11:14:58] <chaos`1> I am using accordian and have it collapsed when the page loads. For some reason the browser scrolls down to the bottom of the page as if it's loading on an anchor. Does anyone know why this happens?
[11:15:20] <antihero> Can jquery use selectors like nth child even if the browser does not support them?
[11:17:20] <snowfox_ben> antihero: Yes
[11:22:35] <Moshe> I had the idea to use jquery to get the title of a html page loaded via ajax, but that does not seem to work. Does anyone know the reason for this?
[11:23:19] <WebDragon> dang where's paul irish when you need him
[11:23:57] <Moshe> <html> and <head> seem to be treated specially (I'm using firefox), can I disable that?

[11:28:59] <fission6> anyone have a rec on a pop up youtube / video player?
[11:29:55] <marcuslind> Is it possible to do reverse :contains? I want to select a element that DO NOT contain a certain string
[11:29:57] <amid_hasan> hi
[11:30:07] <erichynds> marcuslind: :not(:contains())
[11:30:17] <erichynds> or .not(":contains()")
[11:30:19] <amid_hasan> Is anyone in here an expert in selectors?
[11:31:08] <fission6> anyone use prettyPhoto
[11:31:29] <amid_hasan> Need to select all text within '<br>' tags
[11:33:31] <kampsun> Hi! I was wondering how/if I can use jQuery selectors on a string of html. Something like "var string=<table><tr>td id=cell1></tr></table>"?
[11:34:00] <kampsun> How can I select something from that string, using selctors?
[11:34:23] <danzik17> kampsun: $(string).find('#cell1')
[11:35:05] <kampsun> danzik17: I see, thanks a bunch.
[11:36:09] <amid_hasan> ?
[11:36:26] <amid_hasan> Is there a way to select text that's within "<br>" tags?
[11:36:43] <whallz> hi, i have a cloned jquery object, i want to append it to a dom element, how do i make it an html string?
[11:37:09] <kborchers> whallz: why not just append it?
[11:37:19] <amid_hasan> I.e. <br>some text here<br>more text, ca 88888<br> . I need to select the text within these tags, and break them up into indexes
[11:37:22] <ProLoser|Work> anyone feel like giving some input / adding more? https://gist.github.com/1212025
[11:37:43] <kborchers> whallz: $(element).append(clone);
[11:37:56] <imsky> amid_hasan: br tags are self-closing, so unless the in-between text is in spans or something, you'll have to parse the text itself
[11:38:10] <amid_hasan> imsky: how do I parse the text?
[11:38:24] <imsky> with regular expressions
[11:38:33] <marcuslind> erichynds: Cheers, that worked. Last question though, might be real newb one (I started today). I'm trying to save the value of the alt="" tag of a <img> to a var. How do I do this? var foo = $('img'). Then what?
[11:38:52] <erichynds> marcuslind: var alt = $("img").attr("alt")
[11:39:05] <whallz> kborchers: whoa, it was appending [object]
[11:39:07] <marcuslind> ah, .attr.
[11:39:09] <marcuslind> cheers. very nice of u
[11:39:51] <whallz> kborchers: kborchers i was doing something wrong, thanks
[11:39:56] <kborchers> np
[11:40:53] <danzik17> marcuslind, erichynds :  (nitpick) should be using .prop() for that, no?
[11:41:08] <erichynds> no, alt is an attribute
[11:41:51] <danzik17> erichynds: K - was just wondering since I just tested setting the prop directly (in chrome) and it worked as expected.

[11:46:46] <jugstah> try adding .change(); after the function
[11:46:53] <swiggy> yeah that works
[11:46:57] <swiggy> but it doesnt show the div still
[11:47:00] <swiggy> the .change() wont fire
[11:47:03] <ngharo> you got a typo
[11:47:08] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/7MEQw/2/
[11:47:14] <ngharo> publishscheduled != publishschedule
[11:47:46] <swiggy> ...
[11:47:50] <swiggy> look closely.
[11:48:17] <swiggy> one is the radio button... one is the div.
[11:48:25] <swiggy> why would i want the radio button to hide?? 0_o
[11:48:48] <alaing> anyone know where i can find the photoshop irc channel?
[11:48:48] <swiggy> thus, there are not any typos
[11:49:23] <Moshe> ajpiano (and others): using that ba-htmldoc worked, a little too good even, all script tags are loaded and executed from the html doc!
[11:50:05] <Moshe> The normal way does also load the images from the html, but that is not really a problem in my case
[11:50:54] <swiggy> jugstah, did you see my fiddle?
[11:51:05] <swiggy> i can not figure out why it will not fire
[11:51:18] <Moshe> I guess loading the DOM without using .innerHtml is not possible cross-browser?
[11:51:34] <danzik17> swiggy: Why the selection isn't changing, or why the div isn't appearing on page load?
[11:51:48] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/7MEQw/2/
[11:51:50] <swiggy> the selection changes

[11:54:24] <snaplife> hello all..  Could someone help with something thats really puzzling me.. I am using supersized jquery script and an accordian style navbar.. For some reason my hyperlinks stop working when the supersized script loads.
[11:54:28] <snaplife> link is at http://www.snaplife.co.uk/snaplifehome.php
[11:54:35] <snaplife> could someone help me find what part of the script is killing my hyperlinks.. ?
[11:58:45] <Symbi0nt|GER> .html() contains the content. what shall I use to get the whole element?
[11:59:17] <kborchers> ?clone @ Symbi0nt|GER
[11:59:18] <bot-t> Symbi0nt|GER, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:00:10] <Symbi0nt|GER> well I just need the html not the events
[12:00:15] <Symbi0nt|GER> but my be it will do the job
[12:01:52] <MoTiOnXml> doesn't jQuery like id's with "-" in them?
[12:01:55] <kborchers> Symbi0nt|GER: .clone() give you just a copy of the element, .clone(true) would also copy the events and data
[12:02:43] <Symbi0nt|GER> hmm when i use clone a flickering of elements occurs
[12:02:45] <Symbi0nt|GER> not nice
[12:03:09] <Symbi0nt|GER> but may be an unclean selector problem
[12:03:57] <marcuslind> So I created quite a large function that is executed when a form is submitted. However; I also want the same function to run if a Link is pressed. How do I achieve this? I did write "$('form').submit(function geoWeather(data){.........}. However when I call the function later with $('a').live('click', geoWeather(variable)); it does not work.
[12:04:06] <sean`> hi guuys
[12:04:55] <ravenzz> hi frencshish
[12:05:39] <kborchers> marcuslind: couldn't your link just call $("form").submit(); ?
[12:05:48] <watchedman> +1
[12:06:12] <sean`> marcuslind, .live ('click', geoWeather (variable))
[12:06:22] <sean`> unless geoWeather (variable) returns a function
[12:06:36] <sean`> it should be: .live ('click', function () { geoWeather (variable); });
[12:06:44] <sean`> or .live ('click', geoWeather)
[12:08:05] <marcuslind> kborchers: No because I want to send other data to the function with the links then with the submit-form.
[12:10:26] <marcuslind> sean`: I keep getting "geoWeather is not defined" when I call it like that
[12:10:40] <sean`> marcuslind, if it's nto defined, it's nto defined
[12:10:45] <sean`> omg, double typo
[12:11:24] <marcuslind> sean`: Isnt $('form').submit(function geoWeather(data1){......} enough?
[12:11:35] <sean`> it is
[12:11:40] <sean`> but that's about the bind
[12:11:49] <sean`> bind type*
[12:11:54] <sean`> I was talking to you about how to bind a function
[12:11:58] <sean`> two different things bro
[12:12:37] <ravenzz> marcuslind because that function is defined within the submit event
[12:12:50] <ravenzz> just define it outside and use it whenever u need that

[12:32:11] <SEJeff_work> Is there a selector that would select the first text box on a form which doesn't have any value?
[12:32:46] <snowfox_ben> SEJeff_work - that question for me>
[12:33:43] <ngharo> snowfox_ben: i dont see jquery ui loaded..
[12:33:46] <SEJeff_work> A selector that would do the equiv of: $("form input").each(function() { if ( $(this).val() == "") { $(this).focus(); return false; } });
[12:34:14] <SEJeff_work> ^^ Not tested just typed. I'm curious if there is a selector knob I dont know which does the equivalent of that.
[12:34:23] <SEJeff_work> minute the focus method
[12:35:04] <jugstah> these splits are crazy!!!
[12:35:17] <danzik17> SEJeff_work: You could probably do $('#form').find('input[type="text"]).filter( function() { return $.trim( $(this).val()) === ''; }).first()
[12:35:32] <danzik17> SEJeff_work: That's untested off the top of my head fyi, might have a syntax thing somewhere.
[12:35:59] <SEJeff_work> danzik17, Ok so nothing is going to be much faster than $.each then?
[12:36:00] <snowfox_ben> ngharo: Ahhh, grrr. It is only loading for logged in users. what the heck...oooohhhh #drupal
[12:36:12] <SEJeff_work> danzik17, But thats a good start. Thankyou
[12:36:22] <danzik17> SEJeff_work: Probably.  You can jsperf them if you want to see if there's a difference.

Try adding a City in the <input> field such as "Stockholm" and you get weather-info. It also appears in a menu-list to the left. What's the way for me to make the Links work the same way as the Input? All javascript is in that .html file so its easy to see.

[12:46:33] <lectrick> (when I console.log the .click in firefox)
[12:46:50] <lectrick> .data("events") is the magic, nevermind

[13:46:40] <Alig1000> Hi - I am using this example here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data  but am trying to connect to an external database.
[13:46:49] <Alig1000> this works: git://gist.github.com/1212229.git
[13:46:56] <Alig1000> but once I try to connect it to a database, I can't get it to work
[13:47:06] <Alig1000> the line [{"value":"jquery","label":"jquerylabel","description":"jquerydescription","icon":"uiui.png"},{"value":"jqoory","label":"jqoorylabel","description":"jqoorydescription","icon":"ururu.png"}] is JSON output from an external file that I have just copied and pasted in but when I connect to the external file, it fails.  and is driving me a little nuts :)
[13:47:15] <Alig1000> the external file is here:  git://gist.github.com/1212351.git
[13:47:17] <ccmonster> fontzter, you need to collect them one by one and add them to a obj
[13:47:29] <Alig1000> anyone have any ideas where I'm screwing up?
[13:47:50] <ccmonster> jsonlint.com

[13:48:02] <fontzter> ccmonster, can you give an example?
[13:48:52] <ngharo> fontzter: you should be doing $('#first, #second, #third') instead of adding them in one by one if you can imo
[13:49:10] <Alig1000> jsonlint.com validates it

[13:50:11] <Alig1000> I don't think there are any console errors
[13:50:39] <hlveheart> Stupid question, I know. but can you make a jquery function to do something if somebody is on MAC OSX Lion?
[13:50:46] <Alig1000> but I haven't checked for console errors
[13:50:53] <ngharo> Alig1000: you don't _think_? :)
[13:51:00] <ngharo> well check holmes!
[13:51:12] <Alig1000> what's the best way to check, watson?
[13:51:14] <fontzter> ccmonster, it's not really forms, I was just using that as an example. I have to loop through some lower level DOM elements and on certain conditions add a holding div to a list.  Once done, I would like to perform an action on all holding divs that met the criteria.
[13:51:33] <Alig1000> am using FF
[13:51:34] <ngharo> Alig1000: open firebug or chrome inspector
[13:52:02] <hlveheart> Herro?
[13:52:20] <ccmonster> so,create a UL, add LI's(div), then later filter based on div criteria?
[13:52:51] <fontzter> ccmonster, I think I will just put the ids in an array and then call a $() on the split of the array?
[13:53:16] <karega>  is it a smart idea to load DOM parsers i.e. jQuery, dojo before the end of the body tag?
[13:53:17] <ccmonster> if you had a demo it would be easier.
[13:53:35] <hlveheart> can you make a jquery function to do something if somebody is on MAC OSX Lion?
[13:53:50] <hlveheart> Stupid lion doesn't come with java installed

[13:54:03] <Alig1000> If I swap out that JSON line for this code (which was working on another page), my script fails:
[13:54:03] <sylow-> Hi, I have some hover effect, but when the mouseout happens, the div (that was shown) doens't go away. Any advise for this? http://pastebin.com/AeVyJ076
[13:54:04] <Alig1000> source: function( request, response ) { 					$.getJSON( "keywords.php", { 						term: extractLast( request.term ) 					}, response ); 				},
[13:54:20] <ngharo> hlveheart: you can check the user agent
[13:54:37] <hlveheart> Hm
[13:54:38] <hlveheart> that's true
[13:54:44] <fontzter> ccmonster, thanks for you help.  Got me thinking!
[13:55:23] <marcuslind> What is an Rest-server? Something relevant to jquery or ajax?
[13:55:39] <ccmonster> ?rest server
[13:55:42] <bot-t> ccmonster, #7694 (JSONP doesn't use Accept-Header application/json ... - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7694
[13:55:53] <karega> anyone?
[13:56:04] <ccmonster> http://rest.elkstein.org/
[13:56:12] <marcuslind> ccmonster: I'm doing an assigment which says "Make a ajax-call to your Rest-server"
[13:56:58] <ngharo> karega: it doesnt really matter afaik.  Only need to make sure it's loaded before you try and call it obviously.  inside <head> tags would be idea
[13:58:51] <sylow-> never mind, I got it by adding an extra function for the .hover()
[13:59:36] <hlveheart> hoiw would you use useragents to tell an operating systems version?!
[13:59:37] <hlveheart> o.o
[14:01:20] <karega> ngharo, so you would likely not see any performance boost by moving those references below the markup
[14:04:32] <ngharo> doubtful although chrome timeline is smarter than i
[14:04:46] <hlveheart> i </3 chrome
[14:04:47] <hlveheart> :S
[14:07:36] <minijupe> is there a way I can send someone back to the previous page they were on at the same scroll position?
[14:08:15] <ngharo> history.go(-1)
[14:09:59] <minijupe> ngharo: that page need to load from the server, and not load from cache, will that still work?
[14:12:02] <fkefer> hi all!
[14:12:52] <fkefer> i'm tryin to make a website browserfool-proof, having :hover css for the menu but trying to overwrite this with jquery-JS if available
[14:13:29] <fkefer> thing is: first time the event should fire the actual CSS attribute is activated, so instead of a nice, smooth animation i see the text hopping up and down
[14:13:48] <ravenzz> minijupe http://www.robinthomas.in/dotnet/restrict-user-go-back-to-previous-page-after-signout/
[14:13:54] <fkefer> you can see this at http://die-physiotherapeutin.com/neu/
[14:14:12] <fkefer> any ideas how to deactivate the CSS :hover within jquery???
[14:14:53] <ravenzz> minijupe sorry that's not what you are looking for
[14:15:38] <minijupe> ravenzz: different issue. I have a long list of products for "on click buy". The user clicks "buy", sees the purchase page with a message. I want to then redirect to the previous page EXACTLY where they were before the purchase, but instead of buy links, they will see download links.
[14:15:51] <minijupe> oops "one click buy"
[14:16:16] <ravenzz> minijupe ajax?
[14:16:57] <minijupe> ravenzz: thought of that. but don't want my purchase process to require ajax, and we are tracking purchase page visits with google analytics as a 'goal'
[14:17:20] <ravenzz> you can do that as well
[14:17:27] <ravenzz> by ajax
[14:17:38] <minijupe> see reason one above : )
[14:18:33] <ravenzz> ajax will solve your links issue and it is more easy for an user, anyway
[14:20:15] <ravenzz> just make a link to the previous page, it is simple by php
[14:21:03] <ravenzz> and target the links container link http://foo.com/previous.php#download
[14:21:12] <ravenzz> sorry my english is not that good
[14:24:26] <hlveheart> so i need that halp stuffs.
[14:24:40] <webguynow> I'm looking for an elegant system for an update form ( where I only want to submit the values that have been changed )   Any ideas ?
[14:25:53] <hlveheart> basically what I'm triyng to do is have jquery detect OS and those who are on MAC OSX 10.7 Lion, have a div become visible
[14:25:54] <hlveheart> :#
[14:26:05] <hlveheart> i can't figure out how to detect os version numbers
[14:27:41] <ngharo> typically in the user agent...
[14:27:45] <ngharo> navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Mac OS X 10_7') > 0
[14:28:13] <snover> wow, seriously?
[14:28:18] <snover> > 0?
[14:28:21] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:3: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
[14:29:19] <ngharo> != 1 :3
[14:29:30] <ngharo> -1*
[14:30:05] <ngharo> damn i probably have code out there doing >0
[14:30:06] <ngharo> oops
[14:30:45] <webguynow> google with keywords: html form update form only submit values that have changed
[14:31:11] <webguynow> another way to look at it, would be how to modify the $_REQUEST object in php
[14:31:28] <webguynow> love to hear ideas from the guru's in here
[14:32:14] <ngharo> i'd let the backend handle that
[14:33:08] <webguynow> isDirty comes to mind  based on a change
[14:48:01] <jalance> I have a form that I'm building, then appending to $('body'). and then submitting.  This works great in everything but IE.
[14:48:22] <webguynow> $(":input");   as a selector - what does the colon do  ?
[14:49:28] <rroelofs> jalance: how are you creating the inputs?  ie is funny about it
[14:49:58] <jalance> @webguynow: :input will select all inputs (input, textarea, select and button)
[14:50:29] <rroelofs> webguyow: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[14:50:31] <jalance> @rroelofs: http://jsfiddle.net/5Bd7D/
[14:51:22] <rroelofs> jalama:  as i suspected.  ie won't let you change the type after the element is created
[14:52:21] <rroelofs> i think you are stuck with $("<input type=\"hidden\">")...
[14:53:01] <jalance> hmm, ok.  That seems messy though...
[14:53:19] <rroelofs> yup.  I'd love to know a better solution
[15:01:10] <jalance> @rroelofs: is it only the type that can't change?  can I do: $('input type="hidden").attr({value: 1})
[15:04:44] <thomasvs> Hi.  I am creating an Audio() object in javascript code and I want to display it in a table.  How do I place the audio object inside a table instead of some random text as I'm doing now ?
[15:05:34] <webguynow> working on my update form and looking to exclude values that have not changed, from the POST submit.

[15:17:01] <Lundy> extra couple of seconds because of the amount of customers .... can anyone advice me on a way to either limit the query or display them nice and fast ??
[15:21:07] <Paul_Linney> Lundy: maybe something like Flexigrid (http://flexigrid.info/) or jqGrid (http://www.trirand.com/blog/) would help
[15:25:00] <savid> Is there any event I can attach to when the user clicks anywhere but a given element?

[15:42:50] <dreadpiratepeter> I'm having a weird problem with the jkey plugin. I have bound 'alt-letter' keys for various functions in my app. which work fine. However, frequently my app thinks that the alt key is pressed when it isn't, esp. when typing in input fields and textboxes, so it executes my handlers instead of inserting the char. anyone else experienced this?
[15:42:55] <dreadpiratepeter> oh, and behavior happens on both chrome and firexfox. haven't tested on ie
[15:52:37] <RubyTN> I am setting a variable in a js file as follows(it is inside a click event):  window.dvcount = $(".v1").length;  I can alert and use the variable inside the click function, but when I try to use it in another function in another page, I recieve a Uncaught ReferenceError: dvcount is not defined error msg.  any ideas?
[15:52:52] <bitwise_> is there a selector i can use to pull meta tags with og: prefix?
[15:53:18] <RubyTN> I thought that since it was set as window.  it would be valid in all pages

[16:06:52] <xtrci> but i don't want just spots i want two more
[16:07:03] <xtrci> how can i do that without loading everything again ?
[16:11:38] <JmZ> xtrci: probably $("#spots, #another, #andanother").load()
[16:14:05] <xtrci> and i can do
[16:14:19] <xtrci> $('#spots #test').load("main/index/"+date+"/"+city+" #spots #test", function(){
[16:14:21] <xtrci> ?
[16:15:23] <JmZ> xtrci: with a comma
[16:15:32] <xtrci> ok thx <:
[16:15:33] <xtrci> gonna try
[16:15:34] <ajpiano> xtrci: you should just do a single request and then filter the inside of it manually
[16:15:35] <JmZ> wait why are you writing it after
[16:15:48] <JmZ>  #spots #test", function(){ <- this bit, dont do that
[16:18:07] <ajpiano> xtrci: var selectors = ["#foo", "#bar", "#baz"];  $.get("foo", function(data) {  var elms = $(data);   $.each(selectors, function(i, sel) { $(sel).html( elms.find(sel).children() );   });   });

[18:59:19] <coldhead> i just double clicked, tbranyen, and here i are
[18:59:49] <joikus> I'm just saying, if you're going to post a solution after spending 1.3 seconds of googling, and then mention to the person "hey, it's called google" indirectly, you better make sure your link is valid!
[19:00:10] <coldhead> maybe if it were jQuery related you could expect that
[19:00:13] <joikus> fuck I'm right
[19:00:34] <coldhead> i feel like wild troll chases are valid in this situation
[19:00:43] <coldhead> i also feel the lump in my neck
[19:00:47] <coldhead> is it a tumor?
[19:00:50] <coldhead> too scared to see a doctor
[19:01:01] <tbranyen> coldhead: same, only mine isn't on my neck
[19:01:02] <bananasontoast> joikus: You could just join an IIS chan. You'd be surprised how much more they'd know than the guys sitting in a jQuery chan.
[19:01:18] <coldhead> :D
[19:01:22] <bananasontoast> But hey, just a stab in the dark
[19:01:40] <coldhead> any port in a storm
[19:02:02] <bananasontoast> From now on I'll just bit.ly lemon party for irrelevant and bullshit topics bought up in the wrong channels
[19:02:23] <Dave_Stein> bananasontoast: that is a great idea
[19:03:02] * bananasontoast gets down from soap box
[19:03:42] <bananasontoast> shutting up or sending dodgy bit.ly links? lol
[19:03:43] <joikus> bananasontoast: ya I hear ya
[19:05:24] <bananasontoast> joikus: One last try, give this a whirl and see if it's any better. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772009%28WS.10%29.aspx
[19:17:06] <amitprakash> any idea why at morroc.dyndns.org/bidbamboo/ .. the sign in process isn't mediated by the jquery ajax call?
[19:19:12] <Dave_Stein> morroc.dyndns.org/bidbamboo doesn't let me connect
[19:19:14] <janthony> Is there a way with jquery/javascript to detect what element the cursor was in prior to clicking on a button? So the button wouldn't be the element the cursor was in, but let's say if the cursor was in a textbox right before clicking submit, it would show the element being that textbox?
[19:19:47] <Dave_Stein> janthony: i don't think anything exists natively like that
[19:20:09] <Dave_Stein> janthony: you'd need to do something like $('input').bind( 'focus', function() { ... set var for last input here ... });
[19:20:16] <janthony> Dave_Stein: Gotch ya. I wonder how like tinymce editor does it.
[19:20:22] <Dave_Stein> janthony: and then when user submits, reference that var
[19:20:25] <amitprakash> Dave_Stein, strange... The document located at <http://morroc.dyndns.org/bidbamboo/> was successfully checked as HTML5. This means that the resource in question identified itself as "HTML5" and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it. The parser implementations we used for this check are based on validator.nu (HTML5).
[19:20:31] <amitprakash> thats from w3c validator
[19:20:50] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash might be my dns being messed up then?
[19:20:53] <janthony> Dave_Stein: Ahh, I see, that actually makes sense. I'll try that.
[19:21:00] <Dave_Stein> janthony: when does tinymce do that?
[19:21:20] <Dave_Stein> janthony: do you mean how when you double click on an element, it knows what element was highlighted for like a link?
[19:21:28] <janthony> Dave_Stein: So if they clicked inside the editor, have that be the selector/event, and next time it needs to be referenced, just resort back to that var?
[19:21:31] <amitprakash> Dave_Stein, maybe.. let me give you the ip . http://183.82.148.182/bidbamboo/
[19:22:01] <Dave_Stein> janthony: knowing where a user clicked in an editor is way diff than the example you gave. ive done a good amount of text editor work and it's hell haha
[19:22:18] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash: that's working
[19:22:28] <janthony> Dave_Stein: Hehe yeah. Next thing I'm going to have to figure out where the position was in the editor, i.e. if it was between text, etc.
[19:22:58] <janthony> Dave_Stein: I think you gave me enough to try some things though. Thanks!
[19:23:10] <Dave_Stein> janthony i know that stuff
[19:23:16] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash: data is not defined
[19:23:16] <Dave_Stein> [Break On This Error] $( "#login_error_message").html( data); line 6 login.js
[19:23:37] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash: get firebug, use persist. if you have return false in onsubmit that usually means there's a JS error so the return false doens't run
[19:23:57] <amitprakash> Dave_Stein, I am using firebug.. but fb didn'
[19:23:57] <Dave_Stein> janthony: there is a selection object to get that stuff with offsets and whatnot
[19:24:04] <amitprakash> t say that there were errors in my code
[19:24:14] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash cause it said so and then redirected you, did you have persist on?
[19:24:18] <janthony> Dave_Stein: Oh really?
[19:24:26] <Dave_Stein> janthony: yeah but it's diff in different browsers
[19:24:33] <amitprakash> Yes
[19:24:53] <Dave_Stein> janthony: I use YUI's text editor for that stuff. Version 3 is just base crap like that no gui or anything. I use jQuery to contorl all the widgets
[19:25:06] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash: weird... but then again fb can be buggy like that
[19:25:13] <amitprakash> :(
[19:25:49] <janthony> Dave_Stein: Well, to give you more clarity, it's for a WordPress plugin, so I need to work around the editor that comes with WordPress (TinyMCE).
[19:25:58] <Dave_Stein> janthony: by widgets, i mean bold and whatnot. but when you getselection its pretty nasty. for instance offset counts each letter and node as children
[19:26:11] <amitprakash> Dave_Stein, thanks though.. that fixed it :)
[19:26:13] <Dave_Stein> janthony: ahhh that stinks. i chose YUI when i was deciding which was most extendable
[19:26:16] <amitprakash> silly mistake :D
[19:26:21] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash: np
[19:26:26] <Dave_Stein> janthony: let me see if i can dig up some code of mine
[19:30:11] <Dave_Stein> janthony: http://pastebin.com/rtWAuRrU
[19:30:30] <Dave_Stein> janthony: i dont use that code anymore.. its from YUI2, not 3.... but I had to use googles ie range plugin
[19:30:56] <janthony> Dave_Stein: Gotch ya. Thanks, I'll check it out.
[19:31:04] <Dave_Stein> janthony: getwindow and getdoc were just functions in the editor. but you can console log selections and see those offsets which act funny
[19:31:24] <Dave_Stein> janthony: hi <span>Hello</span> Offset 4 would be the span tag for instance
[19:31:33] <Dave_Stein> janthony: and that's all i can give for now ;) good luck
[19:31:40] <janthony> Dave_Stein: I see. Thanks again!
[19:42:13] <notbrent> what is the best lazy image loading plugin?
[19:42:55] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: i think theres one thats just like jquery.lazyload ha lemme see
[19:43:33] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: that's what i use http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[19:43:59] <notbrent> i saw that one but it says at the top that it's 'currently not usable'
[19:44:14] <notbrent> is that just old and it does work?
[19:44:27] <notbrent> doesn't look broken on github
[19:44:45] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: ya know i just looked at the source and got the URL out... now i have to check
[19:45:17] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: what's the github link?
[19:45:23] <notbrent> https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload
[19:45:41] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: it's late ha i just noticed the link as you pasted
[19:45:48] <notbrent> haha
[19:46:07] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: now my coworker is saying we updated the hell out of the file ;)
[19:46:24] <notbrent> i read elsewhere that it causes two get requests for the images - once when the dom is loaded and another when the lazy load triggers
[19:47:49] <notbrent> ahh
[19:47:53] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: eh i just looked in SVN and saw we def modified it to work for us
[19:48:08] <notbrent> give back to oss community? ;)
[19:48:22] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: it's from june 18th, 2010
[19:48:32] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: i gotta double check it tomorrow when my brain isn't fried
[19:49:12] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: i just gave myself a ticket at work
[19:49:41] <notbrent> http://ivorycity.com/ls.php      - this one is working
[19:49:53] <notbrent> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/LazyLoadOnScroll
[19:50:31] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: i don't get how it would fire twice... cause you don't have an SRC on the image until lazyload puts it there, when it scrolls into view
[19:50:38] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: and then it marks it as loaded so it wouldnt fire that twice
[19:52:07] <Dave_Stein> eh im checking now and it works in FF on my site
[19:52:28] <Dave_Stein> http://www.behance.net/assets/js/jquery/jquery.lazyload.js
[19:52:32] <notbrent> it fired twice for me on the example
[19:52:35] <notbrent> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/enabled.html
[19:52:52] <Dave_Stein> in FF?
[19:52:56] <notbrent> chrome
[19:53:04] <Dave_Stein> ok let me check chrome on my site :)
[19:53:08] <notbrent> for example viper_1 is loaded immediately then later it is loaded from cache when lazy load fires
[19:54:20] <Dave_Stein> the link isent you has it working in chrome
[19:54:29] <Dave_Stein> im looking at network tab in dev tool on http://www.behance.net/gallery/Various-work-08/2082512
[19:54:48] <Dave_Stein> im gonna check IE9 with 8 standards
[19:55:35] <notbrent> yeah me too
[19:55:47] <Dave_Stein> looks good in IE for me
[19:55:50] <notbrent> it seems to load from cache for me in chrome
[19:55:55] <notbrent> using the network tab
[19:56:13] <keyo> Hi All, I am having some touble with this:
[19:56:14] <keyo> var links = $(diag_item).find('a.show_history');
[19:56:15] <keyo> 						$(links).fancybox(options);
[19:56:16] <Dave_Stein> you were never on that page though were ya?
[19:56:38] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: i just cleared my cache im gonna go again
[19:57:02] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: says 200 OK for me
[19:57:05] <Dave_Stein> not from cache
[19:57:08] <notbrent> interesting
[19:57:10] <notbrent> ill try again
[19:57:15] <keyo> .fancybox works with (a.show_history), but when I try and bind it on links(1 item) it doesn't work.
[19:57:33] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: sorry the images not frmo cache would be the ones that are larger and jumbles of letters/numbers
[19:57:38] <Dave_Stein> not ones with x85 or whatever in it
[19:57:45] <Dave_Stein> youll see as you scroll down more resources are loaded
[19:58:05] <Dave_Stein> keyo: you sure diag_item is defined properly?
[19:58:31] <Dave_Stein> key: $(diag_item) might not exist or a.show_history might not be in it from bad markup
[19:58:51] <keyo> Dave_Stein: yes, there is one link in the links var according to the debugger
[19:58:56] <Soopaman> howdy all, when dealing with live selector based events, is it the order that the selectors are entered or the specificity of the selector that determines which function is run first? For example which would run first - "a.grabFeed" or ".external a.grabFeed"?
[19:59:20] <Dave_Stein> $('a.show_history') and $('#el').find('a.short_history') return identical results
[19:59:58] <Dave_Stein> Soopaman: you know that's a good question.. never tried... you can make a fiddle and find out. I would imagine it's the order you defined them.
[20:00:01] <keyo> Yeah, I'm confuses why it binds to one set of jQuery objects but not the other
[20:00:12] <Dave_Stein> Soopaman: rather the order you set live
[20:00:34] <notbrent> Dave_Stein: yep it is working on that behance link
[20:00:38] <Dave_Stein> keyo: fiddle it up
[20:00:46] <Soopaman> fiddle/
[20:00:46] <notbrent> did ie work?
[20:00:53] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: looked it
[20:01:01] <Dave_Stein> Soopama: jsfiddle.net you can make simple scripts fast
[20:01:08] <Dave_Stein> *Soopaman
[20:01:49] <Dave_Stein> keyo: we use fancybox all the time here but i don't know if I've ever written a line calling it somehow
[20:01:55] <Soopaman> oh I was hoping to get a "the code was architected to do x" answer
[20:02:18] <Dave_Stein> Soopaman: it should be in the order you said el.live but you can double check in fiddle in 2 seconds
[20:02:36] <Soopaman> k
[20:03:37] <Sample> Q: So I have a named binding (E.G. bind('click.namespace', function(){})) and on one of the radio button click events I check to see if it can be selected, if not I'm doing preventDefault(), however, the other binded click events still fire, I need to prevent them as well. The best way I've found for this is before the preventDefaul(), calling unbind('click.namespace'). This poses a problem
[20:03:37] <Sample> that despite halting this event and associated events completely, they need to be rebinded afterwards
[20:03:53] <Sample> since JS has first class functions, I figure i can just set them to a var, unbind, preventdefault, then rebind
[20:04:03] <Dave_Stein> Soopaman: http://jsfiddle.net/rpY7P/3/
[20:04:24] <Dave_Stein> Soopaman: looksto be order of defining as i thought
[20:04:38] <Sample> i can't figure out how to accomplish this however. I'm attempting it like so..
[20:05:42] <Sample> var thisClick = $(this).data('events').click; .. and for namespaced ones var namedClick = $(this).data('events').click.namespace; ( <-- I think this works)
[20:05:44] <Soopaman> Dave_Stein: interesting, great sample code btw
[20:05:57] <Dave_Stein> Sample: if a radio button is disabled, no event will fire on it
[20:06:00] <keyo> Dave_Stein: doesn't seem to be anything to do with diag_item. Rather when I use a jquery object instead of a selector fancybox won't work
[20:06:11] <Sample> rebinding them however, I can't figure it out...
[20:06:16] <keyo> I will try links.selector).fancybox(...
[20:06:18] <Dave_Stein> Soopaman: np
[20:06:25] <Dave_Stein> keyo: good idea
[20:06:40] <Sample> Dave_Stein: they are enabled, however, they have some dependencies that one option can't be selected if another one is chosen somewhere, so it has to make a check
[20:07:01] <Sample> essentially my question boils down to... how do i prevent a click event, all of its other bindings, and then rebind them, for namespaced click events
[20:07:45] <Dave_Stein> keyo: im looking at code on my site and it works for jquery objects just fine
[20:07:48] <Dollz> Hey
[20:07:55] <Sample> actually what doesnt work is var thisClick = $(this).data('events').click.namespace; I believe
[20:08:12] <Dollz> how can I know the position of a <li> child that has a class "current"  in a <ul>
[20:08:16] <keyo> Dave_Stein: hmm, wtf. I can't really fiddle it, too much context
[20:08:25] <Dave_Stein> Sample: hold on my brain is slow tonight trying to help keyo
[20:08:31] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: $('li.current').position()
[20:08:35] <Sample> Dave_Stein: k no prob
[20:08:50] <Dave_Stein> keyo: $(".job-media").find('a').fancybox( { ... } );
[20:08:52] <Dave_Stein> that even works on my site
[20:08:55] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: sorry , I didn't make it clear , I mean , it's order among it's siblings
[20:09:25] <keyo> wonder if it's the closure in my options
[20:09:28] <Dave_Stein> var $x = $('li'); then $.inArray( $('li.current')[0], $x )
[20:09:29] <keyo> I will paste it..
[20:09:38] <Dave_Stein> i mighta reversed the arguemnts in inArray
[20:10:04] <Dave_Stein> Sample: it sounds like your functions should be in some kind of object where you have a member called disabled
[20:10:12] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: thx :)
[20:10:20] <keyo> Dave_Stein: http://pastebin.com/APRxh8zb
[20:10:45] <Dave_Stein> Sample: and then your dependencies check for that... or you can do stopImmediatePropogation i think
[20:11:06] <Dave_Stein> Sample: i'm just getting thrown off as to why you would need to unbind and then rebind
[20:11:11] <Dave_Stein> Sample: if youre looking to stop the event
[20:11:27] <Sample> Dave_Stein: because i need to not only halt the click event for my binding, but all namespaced bindings as well. i need to halt MY and ALL OTHER click event bindings
[20:11:35] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: np, inArray is needle, haystack
[20:11:41] <Sample> and the way i found that actually works ,is to unbind them, and then call preventDefault()
[20:12:04] <Sample> however i'd need to rebind them to work in the future, in case they move some other selection that makes that radio button actually selectable
[20:12:05] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: k , will put them in that order .. thx again
[20:12:14] <Dave_Stein> Sample: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[20:12:18] <Dave_Stein> that does what youre saying
[20:12:22] <Sample> I'm not sure its a matter of bubbling
[20:12:29] <Sample> but rather a matter of multiple events being binded
[20:12:40] <Sample> ohhh
[20:12:43] <Sample> AND prevents yaddayadda
[20:12:49] <Sample> very nice, this may be what ineed
[20:13:02] <Dave_Stein> Sample: i always get lost in which one to use to be honest but i know i never need to unbind like you said
[20:13:40] <Sample> gotcha, lets give this a shot *crosses fingers*
[20:13:48] <Dave_Stein> keyo: links console logs in both places?
[20:13:54] <Dave_Stein> keyo: the same value?
[20:14:09] <keyo> nope, one is length1, the other is all of them
[20:14:30] <keyo> I want to bind that closure to one specific link
[20:14:32] <Dave_Stein> keyo: ohhh so fancybox probably doesn't like passing multiple elements to it
[20:14:44] <Dave_Stein> keyo: since it can only decide on one :)
[20:14:57] <keyo> it lets me do 'a.class').fancybox
[20:15:09] <keyo> so it can bind to a bunch
[20:15:39] <Dave_Stein> keyo: errr its working for multiple in some code examples im looking up cuase i see them being used on classes
[20:15:46] <Sample> Dave_Stein: It totally didn't work, but that helped me find a solution. I needed --BOTH-- event.stopImmediatePropagation(); AND event.preventDefault()... may be useful for you for future reference
[20:16:00] <Sample> event.stopImmediatePropagation() prevents all other even bindings, however, it allows the radio to be selected
[20:16:16] <Dave_Stein> Sample: ah i just hit return false when iw ant that
[20:16:31] <Sample> preventDefault actually prevents it from being selected (the one that was 'checked' prior to selection retains its value, it literally selects the new one, and then jumps back to the old one)
[20:16:34] <Dave_Stein> Sample: preventDefault is moreso for hwne the function should still return something but i don't think i ever need that in a case wehre i stop stuff
[20:16:40] <Sample> yah
[20:17:01] <Dave_Stein> well at least i helped ou add one line instead of doing wacky bind/unbind :)
[20:17:03] <Sample> I just tried return false; that also works
[20:17:18] <Dave_Stein> Sample: yeah that's the native way
[20:17:27] <Sample> haha yah totally. vars are first class functions so it would have been tooooo wacky i think =) but jQuery has already thought of it
[20:17:33] <Sample> wouldnt* have been
[20:18:33] <Sample> the naming convention is kinda wacky though, because the multiple event issue i dont think has anything to do with bubbling...
[20:18:44] <Dave_Stein> it doesn't
[20:18:59] <Dave_Stein> keyo: sorry couldnt help ya more.. my coworker is who uses it all the time :)
[20:19:12] <Dave_Stein> namespacing isn't real per se
[20:19:19] <Sample> stopPropagation --> only bubbling ... stopImmediatePropagation --> bubbling AND other multiple event bindings (the name doesnt really suggest this) ... preventDefault() --> actually stop the CURRENT event (where-as stopImmediate.. only prevents OTHERS but not its own)
[20:19:34] <keyo> No problem, it's a quirky issue :)
[20:19:42] <Dave_Stein> jquery just splits out on the . and then binds to the real event and checks against any namespace you added after
[20:26:01] <notbrent> Dave_Stein: thanks for the help with lazy loading
[20:31:55] <Dave_Stein> notbrent: np
[20:31:58] <Dave_Stein> fixing bugso n my site now
[20:32:25] <notbrent> related to lazy load?
[20:34:59] <six_away> would anybody have time to help me with a quick box-shadow issue in chrome?
[20:35:07] <six_away> it wont show up at all to be honest
[20:35:29] <six_away> er one sec
[20:35:30] <six_away> link
[20:35:55] <six_away> http://jsfiddle.net/hAU9u/
[20:36:01] <six_away> hit submit without entering anything
[20:36:12] <six_away> validation fails, the required boxes are supposed to box-shadow red
[20:36:22] <six_away> im using -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 2px red;
[20:37:26] <six_away> http://jsfiddle.net/hAU9u/1/
[20:37:40] <six_away> removed red border for testing sake, only box-shadow now
[20:38:19] <snover> box-shadow has not been prefixed since safari 3
[20:38:31] <six_away> ok, well im also using box-shadow
[20:38:43] <six_away> box-shadow: 0 0 2px red;
[20:38:58] <minijupe> looking for docs on dealing with :remote=> true for unobtrusive js in rails. Can anyone refer me to some reference docs?
[20:39:03] <snover> ?testcase @ six_away
[20:39:03] <bot-t> six_away, http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[20:39:50] <six_away> what about it?
[20:40:27] <sixohquad> why did you throw me the testcase link?
[20:42:56] <koyetsu> i'm probably being stupid with this but i'm a complete noob with javascript and jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/Ucyba/ i know it isn't working on that site due tot he json data not going there but the problem i'm sure is the line below $.getJSON where i try and build an array from the json data. can anyone look and tell me the correct way to do that?
[20:44:22] <koyetsu> or point me to an example of something similar that i can hack at?
[20:44:45] <snover> sixohquad: â€œGood testcases are minimal, meaning they contain only what is needed to trigger the effect and nothing else.â€
[20:46:32] <thinkt4nk> quick question, if I do something like $(my_element).is($('img')), jquery doesn't traverse the dom, does it?  It would just inspect the element, right?
[20:47:35] <sixohquad> snover: sorry connection died
[20:48:22] <thinkt4nk> great, I guess I'm going to have to look at the source =\

[20:51:58] <bot-t> sixohquad, A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[20:55:29] <khmer> it can be tough to isolate the problem
[21:20:34] <janthony> var visualEditor = $('#content_ifr').contents().find('.wp-editor').html(); console.log(visualEditor); - Any idea why this is returning [] instead of the html inside .wp-editor?
[21:23:57] <janthony> if I do visualEditor.append('some html here') it works perfectly, and adds it inside the .wp-editor. However, I want to be able to get the contents of the .wp-editor
[21:26:57] <coldhead> janthony: why are you using contents() ?
[21:27:02] <coldhead> why not just find() ?
[21:27:18] <janthony> coldhead: It's an iFrame loaded via AJAX
[21:27:50] <coldhead> UGH, iframes :(
[21:28:05] <coldhead> i don't know what's the dealio, i just have a dragging feeling in my gonads
[21:28:10] <coldhead> sorry :(
[21:28:41] <janthony> coldhead: haha :P
[21:29:13] <Accelerator> How could I call a page fadeOut function upon clicking a form submit button?
[21:30:06] <Accelerator> For some reason, I can't get it to work.
[21:31:06] <coldhead> ?p @ Accelerator
[21:31:07] <bot-t> Accelerator, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:31:16] <coldhead> show what you tried
[21:31:33] <tonyjcamp> oh hai coldhead , I missed you ;)
[21:31:56] <coldhead> hi tjc
[21:32:27] <Jay1> Hi, I'm working on my first jQuery plugin which converts input type=range into draggable sliding things.  Could someone with more experience tell me if the code is alright and how to make my dragging more responsive? http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU
[21:35:59] <sphinxxxx> how bad is it for SEO to have several sections of your site on one page
[21:36:04] <sphinxxxx> and just scroll to the various sections
[21:36:22] <Jay1> Why wouldn't you just make unique pages
[21:36:40] <Jay1> it doesn't hurt seo perse, but there are some gains to separating content
[21:36:42] <sphinxxxx> because i don't want to see the loading
[21:36:49] <sphinxxxx> it breaks the smoothness
[21:37:18] <Jay1> Well then depends on you, coz you could have a new url with new <Title> new metas and new content
[21:37:44] <sphinxxxx> right
[21:37:56] <sphinxxxx> i suppose theres no way to have both
[21:38:05] <sphinxxxx> i have a div that slides in
[21:38:12] <sphinxxxx> but since theres a page reload, it doesn't look smooth
[21:38:24] <sphinxxxx> unless its cached
[21:38:52] <Accelerator> coldhead: Sorry for the delay. http://pastie.org/private/wwukh4qc8ci2qeszpkoq
[21:39:17] <Accelerator> It fades in just fine (on another page)
[21:39:54] <Accelerator> I really just need it to fade out here.
[21:42:21] <coldhead> Accelerator: http://pastie.org/private/p4s1gqueul1u4nkhvyppw
[21:42:24] <coldhead> more like that
[21:43:58] <janthony> Is there a general way to debug what you're clicking on? So if you don't know the selector, click somewhere on the dom, and have console tell you the selector you just clicked on?
[21:44:21] <janthony> I'm having a wierd z-index issue I think, and not sure what the selector is for this item that I'm clicking on is
[21:45:08] <janthony> Typically I would find this via inspect element on Firebug, but that element is not working, as it's an iframe/ajax, even went to the parent of the iFrame, and still no go.
[21:46:23] <Accelerator> coldhead: Thanks, no luck though. Not really a huge deal.
[21:48:32] <tonyjcamp> Accelerator: Did you try wrapping that function inside the document.ready funtion?
[21:48:36] <tonyjcamp> function*
[21:55:43] <Accelerator> tonyjcamp: No, I just copied what he gave me. Think that'd work?
[21:56:10] <tonyjcamp> Accelerator: http://jsfiddle.net/
[21:56:19] <tonyjcamp> sorry
[21:56:22] <tonyjcamp> http://jsfiddle.net/wGJsk/
[21:56:25] <tonyjcamp> it will work
[21:57:13] <coldhead> Accelerator: try making the submit button just a regular button. does that fix the fading?
[21:57:24] <coldhead> if so then you can just add the submit inside the fade callback
[21:58:53] <Accelerator> tonyjcamp: Works on jsfiddle, but no luck on the live site.
[21:59:56] <tonyjcamp> weird, I rolled it back to version 1.3.2 and it still worked.
[22:00:35] <coldhead> maybe use flash instead?
[22:00:46] <tonyjcamp> heh
[22:02:31] <Accelerator> Ahah, nevermind. I got it. I just combined the scripts, forgot the second one was using document ready also
[22:02:53] <coldhead> that shouldn't be a problem buuut
[22:02:55] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:02:55] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:03:44] <Accelerator> Really? I just combined the scripts and removed it like it was on jsfiddle and it worked. Just broke my upload script partially.. just need to figure that part out I guess
[22:05:13] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: know of any good examples using deferrers on non-ajax objects?
[22:17:53] <coldhead> tonyjcamp: no sir! i've never touched deferreds
[22:18:00] <coldhead> ajax or otherwise
[22:18:08] <minijupe> I have some html in a string. How do I get the inner HTML value of one of the tags in the string?
[22:18:15] <tonyjcamp> Cool, thanks.
[22:19:11] <Chibby_> does anyone know any good jquery ui plugins that put little tab like buttons on the side/top/bottom of a page? not actual tab tabs, just button type things
[22:19:53] <coldhead> minijupe: $( ur_string_here ).find('hwatever').html()
[22:20:55] <minijupe> coldhead: tnx. will check that out.
[22:23:39] <minijupe> coldhead: is the hwatever a css selector?
[22:26:36] <zachera> could i rewrite this to utilize prependTo? $('.l').html(u + $('.l').html())
[22:26:47] <zachera> i tried doing $(u).prependTo('.l'); but it didn't work
[22:37:34] <Jay1> what's u
[22:37:36] <Jay1> a var?
[22:38:38] <Jay1> does $('.l').prepend(u) not work
[22:44:26] <pilgo> Why doesn't this return the size of the node before <u> too? http://jsfiddle.net/CMhvs/2/
[23:06:17] <Paveloosha> Hi guys need to update content of a 'span'.. ther is an image and text to.. span.text(mytext).. removing image from the span.. what should I use?
[23:08:05] <_|Nix|_> Paveloosha: span.html("Text <img src='blah.png'></img>");
[23:08:39] <_|Nix|_> Is there an example of how to create a class hierarchy in jqm? Using a widget of my own creation rather than $.mobile.widget for the base does not work.
[23:09:57] <ispirto> hello, anyone knows where can I find a select box that also has the ability to type in like an input? (I'm not interested in auto fill inputs)
[23:15:23] <Chibby_> hmm, does anyone know if there's a command to just move an element from somewhere in the dom to somewhere else?
[23:17:40] <Chibby_> ah, .detach().appentTo() seems to do the trick
[23:18:10] <Clorith> Can I call a function diretly in jQuery after a .delay? (ideally I want to do .delay(1000).function({ lots of stuff here })
[23:18:13] <Cork> Chibby_: you don't need detatch
[23:18:24] <Chibby_> oh
[23:18:25] <Cork> Chibby_: just call appendTo
[23:18:30] <Chibby_> cool, thanks.
[23:18:34] <Cork> a dom element can only have one parent
[23:21:50] <Paveloosha> <_|Nix|_> thanks..I will try that but is there any way to replace text only?
[23:22:40] <_|Nix|_> Paveloosha: Put it in a span of its own, give the span an ID, and then select it like this: $("#theIdOfTheSpan").text("The new text");
[23:24:26] <_|Nix|_> I'm looking at http://bililite.com/blog/extending-jquery-ui-widgets/ and it looks promising, but I dunno if there isn't some other mechanism in jqm that accomplishes the same thing ...
[23:26:08] <Paveloosha> <_|Nix|_> thanks again, yes I know that type of logics but I need to know that is there any function which will replace only text part of an element excluding a div or image tag? if there is no way then it is allrigh. I need to know just to confirm..
[23:26:34] <Clorith> jqueryui's .datepicker numberOfMonths array element isn't compatible with IE8?
[23:27:00] <_|Nix|_> Paveloosha: Maybe if you used .children() and then modified the child representing the tex.
[23:27:03] <_|Nix|_> text.
[23:28:40] <gimi> hi all, in jquery, can I do the similar thing like while ( i < 10) { i++ ....}
[23:29:04] <coldhead> ?mdc while @ gimi
[23:29:10] <bot-t> gimi, while - MDN - Creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while
[23:29:13] <Paveloosha> Thanks <_|Nix|_>, let me try..
[23:31:09] <gimi> thanks, but I would like to do iterator at template
[23:33:36] <Paveloosha> <_|Nix|_>, My structure is like this <span><img src='myImg.jpg'/>My text</span> .. I need to replace 'My text' without tuching '<img src='myImg.jpg'/>' ..
[23:39:18] <coldhead> gimi: what template are you using? you can iterate in most of them
[23:46:34] <gimi> coldhead: For ex: use template tag like {{each listitems }} .... {{/each}} I have the list of fixed 5 items but if listitems have only 3 items, I have to show 2 items with default value
[23:51:55] <hooloovoo> Anyone know if i can mark certain dates in jquery uis datepicker?
[23:55:05] <nail_> hooloovoo: look at the 'beforeShowDay' event if you want to flag some days with a given class
[23:57:24] <coldhead> sup bob_f
[23:58:25] <hooloovoo> nail_: Thank you!
[23:58:50] <nail_> welcome
