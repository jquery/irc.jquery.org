[00:23:56] <kaleb> When attaching events with the .on() function, what happens if one attaches several of the same event to the same object? Does it just overwrite the former attachment or does it create a new one?
[00:55:26] <lemonsparrow> how to give an img tag inside li ?
[00:56:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: give the img what?
[00:59:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: got it thanks :)
[00:59:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork:  $ul.append($('<li class="broadcast">').html('<img width="16" height="16" align="absbottom" src="/admin/assets/img/icon-broadcast.png">  Hi </span>'));
[01:00:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that line is invalid
[01:01:35] <xec_> why
[01:01:49] <Cork> "..... </span>"
[01:01:49] <xec_> well
[01:01:51] <xec_> right
[01:02:02] <xec_> -.-
[01:02:23] * xec_ goes back to bed
[01:02:27] <Cork> lol
[01:02:29] <gry> jqueryObject.text("<foo>").html() adds a properly processed thing â€” &lt;foo&gt; â€” but removes previous content. how to append similarly?
[01:02:49] <Cork> ?.append @ gry
[01:02:50] <bot-t> gry, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[01:02:58] <gry> yes, i saw
[01:03:10] <xec_> that'd make a foo element though
[01:03:16] <gry> ?
[01:03:20] <Cork> ya
[01:03:53] <gry> are you implying .append('<foo>'); works?
[01:03:59] <xec_> document.createTextNode?
[01:04:10] <Cork> ya
[01:04:27] <Cork> .append(document.createTextNode('<foo>'))
[01:09:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: need help with this http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/HcY32/2/ xec_
[01:09:38] <xec_> isn't that a css question?
[01:10:08] <xec_> on the other hand, i don't know if you can do that with css xD
[01:10:08] <lemonsparrow> xec_: is it possible using js/jquery ?
[01:10:17] <xec_> just noticed the order
[01:12:36] <ph88> what could be causing a "Unhandled Error: 't.widget' is not a function" at line 9 in http://pastebin.com/hi7Xu437   ?
[01:16:11] <xec_> holy shit i think i went a bit overboard with this http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/3/
[01:16:49] <xec_> it does, uh, "work" though
[01:17:48] <ph88> xec_: overboard ? :D
[01:17:57] <lemonsparrow> xec_: lol... its not always 5 items :)
[01:18:09] <lemonsparrow> xec_: anyway I gues css should be able to fix it
[01:18:33] <lemonsparrow> xec_: ok It is 5 items always.. 3 in one column and the other 2 in adjacent column
[01:18:47] <xec_> lemonsparrow: according to your spec it "works" :D
[01:19:19] <ph88> this is difficult in css ... the best if if you precalcuate the amount of items per column. And then in the second column set the start="" html attribute to continue the count to the second list
[01:20:25] <ph88> looks like phil is at work
[01:20:44] <Phil-Work> lol
[01:22:06] <ph88> Phil, what could be causing a "Unhandled Error: 't.widget' is not a function" at line 9 in http://pastebin.com/hi7Xu437   ?
[01:23:41] <xec_> lemonsparrow: do you always want it in 2 columns? http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/4/
[01:24:30] <xec_> lemonsparrow: or 3? http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/5/
[01:24:45] <lemonsparrow> xec_: dude hang on lol
[01:24:49] <xec_> :D
[01:25:11] <lemonsparrow> xec_: give me a simple css solution
[01:25:13] <ph88> omg
[01:25:28] <ph88> lemonsparrow: i looked into this before
[01:25:41] <ph88> there was a guy explaining 5 different css solutions
[01:25:46] <ph88> they were all complicated
[01:25:55] <ph88> i decided on precalculating the amount of items per list
[01:26:05] <xec_> lemonsparrow: i already told you, i don't know if you can do that with css. maybe if you wanted A C E in the first col and B D in the second
[01:26:11] <ph88> total / amount_of_columns = amount per list
[01:26:54] <xec_> lemonsparrow: the code i wrote isnt TOO difficult if you sit down and read it all
[01:27:48] <xec_> i make a temporary UL that i append and empty at the time i reach the end of each column
[01:28:23] <sayakb> hi guys - for the twitter bootstrap modal, i use a modal with a big form and therefore have a scrollbar. i want to reset the scrollbar to top each time i open the modal. i tried $('#my-modal .modal-body').scrollTop(0); but it doesn't seem to work. any pointers?
[01:29:26] <xec_> sayakb: are you sure the selector matches the element that has the scollbar?
[01:30:08] <sayakb> xec_, yep
[01:30:12] <xec_> and you're running the code at a time it is visible?
[01:30:31] <sayakb> i tried both
[01:30:44] <sayakb> should i trigger it on 'shown' ?
[01:31:05] <xec_> i'm not sure you would be able to scroll a hidden element
[01:31:07] <xec_> sayakb: is your site live somewhere?
[01:31:33] <sayakb> nope, it's on my local. i can host it in a bit though
[01:31:58] <sayakb> let me try the shown one once
[01:32:57] <sayakb> woohoo! that works
[01:33:32] <sayakb> thanks xec_
[01:33:41] <xec_> yw :)
[01:33:51] <anli> It would be so nice if I could see elements top left corner in firebug
[01:33:56] <anli> (firefox)
[01:37:05] <xec_> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/7/
[01:37:48] <xec_> probably not very well supported in older browsers, and new ones still require the vendor prefixes
[01:39:40] <xec_> ph88: if you were interested in the easy css version ^
[01:41:07] <ph88> xec_: notice that the columns do not align at the top
[01:42:06] <xec_> yeah but that's just the margin, there is a native top and bottom margin on <ul>, and since there is only one <ul> only the start of it will have the top margin
[01:42:14] <xec_> easy to fix
[01:42:36] <xec_> ph88: with normalize http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/8/
[01:43:24] <xec_> jsfiddle <3
[01:43:47] <ph88> xec_:  the bullets dissappeared now
[01:43:53] <xec_> no kidding :)
[01:44:21] <ph88> with bullets and align top ??
[01:44:39] <ivnz> hello
[01:44:49] <xec_> just remove the margin... http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/9/
[01:45:30] <xec_> hello ivnz
[01:45:44] <ph88> ah yes xec_  that's nice http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/10/
[01:47:36] <ph88> xec_:  could you help me with this one ... "Unhandled Error: 't.widget' is not a function" at line 9 in http://pastebin.com/hi7Xu437   ?
[01:48:13] <xec_> what's t ?
[01:49:12] <ph88> it's a library i downloaded
[01:49:12] <xec_> line 7 looks hella funky too
[01:49:14] <ph88> not my own code
[01:49:19] <ph88> it's the minified version
[01:49:57] <ph88> this is the normal version  (just i use 3.5.0 and this is 3.6.0) https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/blob/master/src/javascripts/jquery.selectBoxIt.js
[01:50:36] <xec_> oh wait, that should indeed work
[01:50:46] <anli> I want to know which piece of code that moves a div to a certain position. Any suggestions on how to do that?
[01:50:47] <xec_> depending on how the function ends
[01:50:54] <xec_> t should be jQuery
[01:51:13] <xec_> just haven't seen that particular pattern before
[01:51:14] <anli> For some reason, the y position becomes 1380
[01:51:26] <xec_> ph88: is jquery ui loaded?
[01:52:11] <ph88> xec_:  no
[01:52:21] <ph88> only jquery
[01:52:33] <xec_> ph88: that could be it, then - afaik widget is part of UI
[01:52:48] <lemonsparrow> ph88: xec_ good work guys
[01:52:49] <ph88> ok it's not that clear that it has this dependency, i check it out .. thx
[01:53:00] <ph88> lemonsparrow: xec_ did the most :)
[01:53:04] <lemonsparrow> xec_: ph88 I can se healthy competition b/w you two :)
[01:53:09] <ph88> :P
[01:53:14] <ph88> i like it !
[01:53:17] <ph88> <3 xec_
[01:53:21] <xec_> ^^
[01:53:33] <lemonsparrow> xec_: ph88 help me make the css inline http://jsfiddle.net/HcY32/7/ here
[01:53:55] <xec_> why on earth do you want it inline?
[01:54:32] <xec_> css solution => css fil
[01:54:33] <xec_> file*
[01:54:58] <ph88> maybe he means display: inline  ?
[01:55:20] <anli> What is the number showing under the box in the layout tab of firebug?
[01:55:25] <anli> Its 1380 above and -1060 below
[01:55:28] <anli> Super strange
[01:55:53] <lemonsparrow> xec_: that's a pattern I am following pls help me make it inline bro
[01:57:37] <ph88> is it ok to load the full jquery ui ? (it's the only thing CDN's offer) ... or is it better to load only the parts i need myself ??
[01:58:07] <ph88> lemonsparrow: better go to #css for that
[02:00:06] <lemonsparrow> ph88: yeah display inline something like that I want to put it inside div somewhere
[02:00:25] <xec_> display inline != inline css
[02:00:29] <xec_> which one do you mean
[02:01:06] <xec_> ph88: up to you. i'd probably just do the cdn and be done with it
[02:01:35] <lemonsparrow> xec_: pls help me get it done inline
[02:02:23] <ph88> xec_: ye i'm kind of done with it now :P
[02:04:01] <xec_> lemonsparrow: seriously, if inline css is a pattern you are following, you need to change your pattern :P
[02:06:03] <lemonsparrow> xec_: that is not helping me :P
[02:06:32] <xec_> i beg to differ
[02:06:45] <xec_> it may not be the answer you want, but it's the answer you need
[02:07:10] <lemonsparrow> xec_: but for now help me bro :(
[02:07:28] <xec_> maybe if you had a proper reason to?
[02:07:56] <xec_> and why can't you just do it yourself if it is indeed "a pattern" you're following??
[02:08:11] <sathish> I am using windows 7 64 bit, vs 2010, asp.net web applilcation
[02:08:27] <sathish> getting a json undefined error only in ie 10\
[02:08:41] <sathish> there is no code in the page, just the reference to 2.0.2 in google cdn
[02:08:58] <xec_> sathish: try 1.9.1 instead
[02:09:09] <sathish> 1.9.1 works
[02:09:09] <xec_> or 1.9.2 is latest?
[02:09:16] <xec_> yeah
[02:09:18] <sathish> I thought 2 is latest
[02:09:37] <xec_> no, 2.x is the same api as 1.9 but without IE support :P
[02:10:04] <sathish> but I thought 2.0 removed support for ie 8, 7  and 6
[02:10:09] <xec_> in theory
[02:10:15] <xec_> :D
[02:10:47] <anli> If I want to rearrange children in a div, can I use prepend?
[02:10:52] <sathish> so do I have to stick with 1.9.2 for some time
[02:11:00] <sathish> when should I move to 2.0s
[02:11:41] <xec_> sathish: you could check to see if your site is in "compatibility mode"
[02:12:35] <sathish> you mean ie compatibility mode
[02:13:28] <lemonsparrow> I have a line like this $div.clone().css({'width':'49.5%'}) how to add class for this div ?
[02:13:31] <lemonsparrow> xec_: ^^
[02:13:58] <xec_> ?addclass @ lemonsparrow
[02:13:59] <bot-t> lemonsparrow, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[02:14:11] <xec_> sathish: yes
[02:15:05] <lemonsparrow> xec_: ok but how will I give a classname "xx" for that line
[02:15:27] <xec_> lemonsparrow: sounds like you need to go back and learn the basics
[02:15:36] <sathish> xec_ ie is not in compatablity mode
[02:15:56] <xec_> sathish: ok, then i guess IE just sucks ;)
[02:16:24] <xec_> sathish: and as such, i have no idea when you should migrate to 2.x
[02:16:40] <xec_> let me know if you find out :)
[02:17:21] <Cork> xec, sathish: ie9+ should work fine in 2.0
[02:17:40] <xec_> Cork: *should*, yes
[02:17:47] <Cork> what's failing?
[02:18:01] <xec_> some JSON parsing, according to sathish
[02:18:08] <xec_> my guess it's in compatibility mode though
[02:18:17] <Cork> testcase?

[02:20:48] <bot-t> b-ot, 12577 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12577
[02:20:55] <Cork> lol
[02:20:58] <Cork> there it came :D
[02:20:58] <xec_> that was random
[02:21:22] <sathish> <xec>_ here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/sathishdba/n2UgR/
[02:21:23] <Cork> xec: bot-t tries to actually look up what b-ot sent to it :)
[02:21:44] <Cork> thats just jquery...
[02:21:47] <Cork> and an empty div
[02:22:02] <xec_> and html in the js field
[02:22:07] <xec_> nice demo, bro
[02:22:10] <xec_> :D
[02:22:13] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/n2UgR/1/
[02:23:21] <xec_> yeah, that doesn't work in IE10, all i get is a white page
[02:23:28] <Cork> lol
[02:23:28] <sathish> yes with just this we are getting JSON undefined
[02:24:01] <Cork> sathish: jquery has never implemented JSON
[02:24:01] <xec_> wait what
[02:24:21] <xec_> but it works when you use  jq 1.9.x
[02:24:29] <Cork> if the browser doesn't provide JSON and 2.0 depends on it load json2.js
[02:24:37] <Cork> ?g json2.js
[02:24:38] <b-ot> Cork: douglascrockford/JSON-js Â· GitHub â†’ https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[02:24:38] <bot-t> Cork, douglascrockford/JSON-js · GitHub - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[02:25:00] <xec_> but IE10 does indeed provide JSON
[02:25:35] <sathish> json2.js and json3.js we tried both but no luck
[02:26:08] <xec_> sathish: well, a demo that illustrates the issue is the first step to getting proper help i'm afraid
[02:26:23] <xec_> an empty  <div> just doesn't cut it
[02:26:34] <lemonsparrow> I have container.append($('<div>').addClass('headerBox').html('Account')); How can I add style to the div ?
[02:26:37] <remysharp> so little love for jsbin from bot-t :)
[02:26:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: xec_
[02:27:23] <Cork> sathish: can you provide a demo that actually fails?
[02:27:32] <Cork> as in actually does something with json?
[02:33:57] <sathish> I will upload and give you the link
[02:37:31] <sathish> I have a demo\
[02:37:33] <sathish> http://planmyleave.com/website1/default.aspx
[02:37:48] <sathish> there is nothing in this page, only reference to 2.0.2 from google cdn
[02:38:24] <sathish> there is zero lines in the code only reference to 2.0.2
[02:38:43] <xec_> and no errors either...?
[02:38:59] <lemonsparrow> how can I build this table using jquery append ? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/m7VQ9/
[02:39:17] <sathish> is your ie in compatibility mode
[02:39:32] <sathish> we are getting errors, we are not getting errors when we use 1.10.2
[02:40:02] <xec_> nope, but it does complain about the doctype
[02:40:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ^^
[02:40:25] <sathish> so do I have to do some change to doctype
[02:40:47] <xec_> sathish: no reason not to just use <!doctype html>
[02:41:01] <sathish> let me try
[02:41:05] <sathish> currently we are using <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
[02:41:21] <xec_> why
[02:41:30] <sathish> default in vs 2010
[02:41:37] <xec_> i see
[02:41:44] <sathish> let me change and try
[02:43:28] <sathish> no luck, still the same error
[02:43:38] <xec_> which is "no error"?
[02:43:50] <xec_> i don't see any errors on that page...
[02:43:54] <Cork> sathish: the compatibility mode is for emulating pre ie7
[02:44:15] <Cork> and yes that will trigger JSON node defined as it wasn't defined back then
[02:44:21] <Cork> node==not
[02:44:55] <xec_> sathish: do you have any whitespace (or newlines etc) in front of the doctype?
[02:44:58] <Cork> and yes jquery 2.0 doesn't work in ie 7 or older
[02:45:34] <Cork> note though, i had to manually move ie10 to compatibility mode for the page you gave me
[02:45:47] <Cork> by default it just complained about the doctype
[02:46:09] <sathish> let me try again
[02:46:21] <Cork> sathish: why are you using transitional?
[02:46:31] <Cork> just use <!doctype html>
[02:46:35] <xec_> 11:41 <sathish> default in vs 2010
[02:46:37] <xec_> xD
[02:46:43] <Cork> bah
[02:47:08] <Cork> abouit the whitespace before the doctype that is valid
[02:47:11] <Cork> it'
[02:47:31] <Cork> *'s only for xml you need to care about space
[02:47:38] <Cork> <?xml thingy
[02:47:59] <xec_> are you sure?
[02:48:02] <Cork> yes
[02:48:36] <Cork> there is a limit to how much data can exist before it, but it seeks ahead(sniffs) in the first package it gets
[02:48:53] <Cork> if you have enough data that <!doctype isn't part of the first package you're in trouble
[02:49:32] <Cork> but then you're in trouble for other reasons, that is worse then the quick mode :D
[02:53:16] <xec_> well, in any case there is no reason to have anything in front of the doctype, and i'm positive removing leading whitespace has solved issues for me in the past
[02:55:09] <sathish> sorry, I assumed blue torn paper means not compatible view
[02:55:36] <sathish> it looks like blue means compatibility mode, so now when it is grey in color it works
[02:55:47] <sathish> sorry for troubling all of you guys
[02:55:51] <Cork> xec: it depends what character the whitespace is built with :)
[03:02:20] <stefuNz> Hi. I have an ajax call which can take a long time (15+ sec) - however, sometimes when i click on another div, i want to cancel that and do another ajax call. it seems that i have to wait for the old ajax request to complete, although i do .abort() - how can i "really" abort the old request so i don't have to wait?
[03:05:42] <someone235> is there a built-in function to parse GET query string?
[03:06:10] <_rgn> someone235: google jquery parse query string
[03:06:23] <someone235> I didn't find
[03:07:58] <k_sze[work]> What's the proper way to attach a key press or key down event handler on all text or password input fields that may be dynamically generated as the user uses thepage?
[03:08:24] <k_sze[work]> using jquery, if possible.
[03:08:55] <someone235> i think someone like $('input[password]').on('keydown',function);
[03:09:07] <someone235> *something
[03:10:44] <k_sze[work]> I know it is possible to do $(document).click(function(e){if (e.currentTarget.tagName === 'A'){/*...*/}})
[03:10:51] <k_sze[work]> for <a> elements anyway.
[03:11:14] <k_sze[work]> someone235: your solution would attach the handler only to elements that *already* exist.

[03:11:34] <Trudko> Guys I have a bit of problem with how Jquery behave if I run some method on empty result of selector. If I use pure DOM api i get error so I know something is wrong(i am looking for element which isn't there) but jquery just silently let me get away with it.
[03:11:49] <Trudko> how do you deal with it?
[03:12:11] <_rgn> Trudko: check the length of the result?
[03:12:46] <someone235> _rgn, 'live' is deprecated. use 'on'
[03:12:46] <Trudko> _rgn: and do it everytime I run some jquery selector?
[03:12:56] <_rgn> someone235: i said live event handlers, not live()
[03:13:06] <someone235> OK :)
[03:16:11] <Deele> someone uses fancybox ?
[03:16:26] <Deele> I have a problem with gallery view
[03:18:24] <Deele> I have a need to open a gallery view in fancybox, but I need it to jump to specific image inside it
[03:19:04] <Deele> I'm using script like this: t_jumped = false; $.fancybox.open(timg_group,{afterShow:(function(){if (!t_jumped){t_jumped = true;$.fancybox.jumpto(id);}})});
[03:19:12] <Deele> but it has a delay, when starting up
[03:19:51] <Deele> it opens a first gallery image, and after a small delay, it jumps to required image
[03:27:55] <_rgn> Deele: i don't see fancybox having a jumpto method, which version are you using
[03:28:51] <Deele> _rgn 2.1.4
[03:29:21] <Deele> _rgn http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#docs
[03:29:52] <Deele> it's an "API method"
[03:30:40] <_rgn> call $.fancybox.open with { index: ... } option?
[03:33:33] <Deele> _rgn, omg, it works, THANK YOU
[03:36:44] <ivnz> any1 use fancybox on tag's changed with ajax?
[03:51:51] <spobat> hi
[03:52:00] <spobat> how can I access the selector within a click?
[03:52:08] <spobat>     $('#modal-new-room-submit').click(function(_) {
[03:52:08] <spobat>         if($(this).is(':disabled')) {
[03:52:09] <spobat>             console.log('pressed but DIS');
[03:52:11] <spobat>         }
[03:52:24] <spobat> do I have to use the $('...') in the function again?
[03:53:49] <Clex> spobat: around "this"?
[03:53:58] <spobat> what?
[03:54:09] <Clex> Use $('...') wher?
[03:54:12] <Clex> *where
[03:54:16] <spobat> so the above code is correct?
[03:54:25] <spobat> Clex: in the if
[03:54:40] <Clex> Yes you have to if you want to use .is().
[03:54:41] <spobat> or is $(this) already doing the exact same thing?
[03:54:50] <sammich> yes, $(this) is the object that triggered the handler
[03:55:06] <spobat> ok, that's it, thank you!
[04:21:57] <seutje> spobat: within event handlers, "this" is usually a reference to the DOM element, not a jQuery collection, so in order to use jQuery methods, u have to wrap it in $(), yes
[04:27:26] <RanY> Hello all
[04:28:08] <sammich> but $(this) is jQuery el
[04:28:34] <RanY> I'm upgrading to jQuery 1.10.1 and I have a plugin that uses $.data('events') and i need to find a way to replace it
[04:28:37] <RanY> can anyone help me?
[04:31:07] <seutje> RanY: $._data(element, 'events')
[04:31:26] <MariusIT> hi
[04:31:30] <seutje> internal shizzle was split off from the standardized data- attributes api thing
[04:31:44] <MariusIT> what do i need to add to make the class selection toggle one at a time http://jsfiddle.net/JrhNz/276/ ?
[04:33:07] <seutje> RanY: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/08/building-a-slimmer-jquery/ about halfway down the page
[04:33:47] <RanY> cool, thanks!
[04:34:09] <RanY> i was actually ready to update the plugin to not use the $.events('data')
[04:34:32] <RanY> and i'm looking for a better way to accomplish my plugin functionality
[04:34:43] <RanY> https://github.com/kaltura/mwEmbed/blob/master/modules/MwEmbedSupport/jquery/jquery.triggerQueueCallback.js#L52
[04:35:02] <RanY> and i use it like: https://gist.github.com/ranyefet/5875744
[04:35:38] <seutje> MariusIT: damn, 276? here's 277 :P http://jsfiddle.net/JrhNz/277/
[04:35:41] <RanY> basically it allow me to trigger a function that will only be called once
[04:35:56] <MariusIT> i worked alot on it :(
[04:36:40] <seutje> RanY: what's this suppose to do? trigger every handler for every event type on the element?
[04:38:38] <seutje> RanY: oh wait, u just wanna have a callback for when all other callbacks for that event type are done?
[04:38:49] <RanY> yep, exactly
[04:39:12] <seutje> sounds like a job for deferreds
[04:39:19] <seutje> or however u spell that again
[04:40:26] <RanY> i'll try and read about it, will i have to use it in the same manner i use my plugin today?
[04:41:00] <RanY> i guess not :\
[04:41:24] <seutje> RanY: here's an example of how to use deferreds with event handlers: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009194/how-to-use-jquery-deferred-with-custom-events
[04:41:54] <seutje> although the example is slightly different from your use case, it should give you an idea
[04:42:14] <cusco> hello folks
[04:42:40] <cusco> I am using .tabs() and if I read $(tabs).tabs( "option", "active" ) - returns the index of the active tab
[04:42:45] <RanY> @seutje cool thanks a lot :)
[04:42:56] <cusco> can I get the id of the <li> of that tab instead??
[04:43:13] <cusco> or how do I use tab.tabid ?
[04:44:05] <tff> So for some reason in my form submit handler $(this).serialize() is empty
[04:44:11] <tff> Any common causes to this?
[04:44:49] <tff> Logging $(this) returns --
[04:44:50] <tff> [07:42:34.642] ({0:({}), context:({}), length:1})
[04:44:53] <cusco> tff: your input elements need name attribute ...
[04:44:57] <cusco> show us some code
[04:45:13] <tff> Oh, id won't cut it?
[04:45:19] <cusco> tff: name
[04:45:39] <tff> Huh, weird that i've never experienced this problem before
[04:45:53] <Cork> tff: forms has never cared about id's
[04:45:56] <cusco> id is for the browser, name is also for the http protocol (on the post)
[04:46:10] <Cork> uh..
[04:46:15] <Cork> http doens't care about names either
[04:46:35] <cusco> yes that was a unhappy statement
[04:46:37] <Cork> the browser use the name attribute when it collects the fields for a submission
[04:46:49] <cusco> that
[04:47:08] <tff> I guess i've always just had them be the same or something
[04:47:19] <tff> But I didn't write this form, so i guess lesson learned
[04:47:19] <cusco> how do I get the id of a tab from .tabs() using its tabindex
[04:47:34] <cusco> the <li> constructing the tab, has a id
[04:47:43] <cusco> and I have the tab index
[04:47:51] <Cork> cusco: if i remember correctly the tab doesn't have an id
[04:47:56] <Cork> the content element does
[04:48:01] <cusco> the li does too
[04:48:07] <cusco> it doens't I give it one
[04:48:11] <cusco> in a function to add tabs
[04:48:32] <Cork> ah
[04:48:35] <cusco> $( "<li id='"+id+"'><a href='#somestuff"'>google</a></li>" ).appendTo( ul );
[04:48:54] <Cork> ui-id-<index>
[04:48:57] <cusco> ul = tabs.find('ul');
[04:49:29] <cusco> er .. ui-id ? where can I read more about that
[04:50:15] <Cork> cusco: i just checked the generated html
[04:50:37] <Cork> the tab gets an id="ui-id-1", id="ui-id-2" and so on
[04:51:10] <cusco> not in my case... where I add tabs like this: http://paste.debian.net/12943/
[04:51:42] <cusco> but.. I guess I can use any other attribute
[04:51:56] <Cork> in what context to you want the id?
[04:51:56] <cusco> thing is.. well i'm not sure let me check my code agian... brb
[05:00:12] <MariusIT> seutje: thank you, i cleaned it up a little http://jsfiddle.net/JrhNz/278/ :D
[05:03:45] <nysos> anybody using jquery with asp.net using c# ? need some help
[05:05:05] <cusco> Cork: ok what I need is to find out the tab index of certain tab... and I have a custom attr for the <li> that is the tab
[05:05:32] <Cork> cusco: yes, but what reference do you have for the tab?
[05:05:38] <cusco> the attr
[05:05:39] <Cork> and where are you when you need it
[05:05:54] <cusco> something like: $('li[groupname='+id+']').getTabIndex()
[05:06:01] <Cork> where are you when you need it
[05:06:06] <cusco> my goal is to activate a specific tab
[05:06:10] <Cork> where are you when you need it
[05:06:16] <cusco> I am processing a function
[05:06:17] <cusco> js
[05:06:23] <Cork> ...
[05:06:35] <cusco> I have var tabs as global = element.tabs()
[05:06:42] <cusco> so I can use tabs.....
[05:06:51] <cusco> what do you mean 'where are you' ?
[05:06:52] <Cork> what code flow are you currently executing when you need to grab the id of the tab?
[05:07:08] <cusco> I don't need the id, only the tab index
[05:07:21] <Cork> fine; but still
[05:07:25] <cusco> a js function is being called ... trough websockets
[05:07:36] <Cork> ok, so it is from a message event
[05:07:37] <cusco> and I need to set another tab as active
[05:08:27] <cusco> so I can call up on $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "active", 1 );
[05:08:32] <cusco> but 1 is the tabindex
[05:08:43] <cusco> and how do I find the tabindex for $('li[groupname='+id+']')
[05:09:11] <Cork> groupname?
[05:09:18] <Cork> that's not a valida attribute
[05:09:18] <cusco> that is my custom attribute
[05:09:27] <Cork> then put it in the data- scope
[05:09:31] <cusco> ? can't I make up attributes?
[05:09:35] <bot-t> cusco, #9323 ("width" and "height" can not be set as attributes when ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9323
[05:09:35] <Cork> no
[05:10:24] <Cork> you are bound for breakage from name conflicts from future specs if you just add arbitrary attribute names
[05:10:24] <cusco> tell me more about data-
[05:10:30] <Cork> thats why the data- scope was created
[05:10:40] <Cork> just prefix the attribute  name with data-
[05:10:47] <Cork> data-groupname=""
[05:10:53] <cusco> ah.. and thats valid?
[05:10:56] <Cork> yes
[05:10:58] <cusco> ok
[05:11:02] <cusco> still..
[05:11:16] <Cork> element.tabs('widget').find('li[data-groupname=""]').index()
[05:11:28] <cusco> ow
[05:11:38] <cusco> lets try
[05:12:27] <Cork> though that said, i would prob recommend to use a class if you only plan to use it for selection
[05:12:42] <Cork> it is what those where created for after all
[05:12:51] <raj> what is the meaning of the (2) shown in chrome's dev tools, under "done changing date" ? http://i.imgur.com/gCOPl6b.png
[05:13:05] <raj> is everything before it repeated twice?
[05:13:08] <billyjoe_> Is there a jquerymobile widget/control that looks like an ios home screen? http://www.computerworld.com/common/images/site/features/2010/06/ios4homescreen.jpg
[05:13:25] <Cork> raj: the message has been outputed that number of timer
[05:13:30] <billyjoe_> I thought I had seen such a widget once, but now I can't find it. (So perhaps it wasn't for jquery mobile)
[05:13:58] <seutje> raj: it means there was an empty log statement twice (empty as in empty string or variable that coerced to an empty string)
[05:14:22] <Cork> aha
[05:14:24] <Cork> that line :)
[05:14:30] <raj> seutje, but I don't have one
[05:14:40] <seutje> u calling me a liar? :P
[05:14:43] <raj> :)
[05:14:44] <Cork> lol
[05:14:56] <seutje> or u calling devtools a liar? (I can live with that tbh)
[05:15:06] <Cork> it could be a string of spaces
[05:15:14] <seutje> yeah, or that
[05:15:35] <raj> seutje, http://paste.ofcode.org/aeCkemguk9RXAHQLECA7x2
[05:15:45] <seutje> or maybe "\n"
[05:15:55] <Cork> raj: console.log(refreshed) ?
[05:16:11] <seutje> var refreshed = GM_getValue('refreshed', false) for all I know this is an empty string
[05:16:40] <seutje> raj: put console.log('refreshed: ', refreshed); instead
[05:16:45] <seutje> then it'll at least log something
[05:16:45] <Cork> it is a separate line so it isn't a line break
[05:16:54] <raj> k
[05:17:28] <seutje> all ur other logs have a string in them, it seems, so it has to be that on
[05:17:29] <seutje> e
[05:18:24] <raj> nope
[05:18:25] <raj> still not
[05:18:44] <Cork> raj: so pause the execution and step through it to find where it comes from
[05:18:56] <Cork> it sounds like it is from somewhere else though
[05:20:49] <seutje> or go all console.log = function() {console.trace();} :P
[05:21:08] <Cork> or why not just search through the tree for console.log
[05:21:37] <seutje> but that's so hipn't
[05:21:44] <Cork> :)
[05:22:08] <seutje> lol, I'm using console.log() in php now
[05:22:18] <raj> Cork, what tree?
[05:22:32] <raj> Cork, I'm using tampermonkey, i'm not sure i can pause this
[05:22:36] <Cork> the code tree
[05:22:57] <Cork> meaning all the files you have for the site/app
[05:23:07] <Cork> or simply do :%s/console\.log\(.*\)//g ;P
[05:36:47] <raj> Cork, I showed you all the code though
[05:36:51] <raj> there are no other console.log's
[05:36:59] <Croves> Ok, noob question: when I have something like <a href="#tab" data-toggle="tab">, what should I do to select this a with this data-toggle?
[05:37:34] <Cork> raj: there isn't ? :D
[05:37:36] <Cork> var $avail_dates = $calendar.find('a').each(function(i,el){console.log($(el).text())}) <--
[05:37:52] <raj> oh, wow
[05:38:16] <raj> sowwy :(
[05:38:20] <Cork> lol
[05:40:19] <nysos> so i tried to use above code so that the other tab does not get activated when working on one
[05:40:26] <nysos> how can i achieve this ?
[05:41:14] <Cork> nysos: "above code"?
[05:41:39] <nysos> i just wrote a few lines here
[05:41:47] <nysos> see above ^^
[05:41:53] <Cork> no so i tried as the first
[05:42:26] <Cork> * nysos (~nysos@101.61.132.105) has joined #jquery | <nysos> so i tried...
[05:43:09] <nysos> can i pm you it's just a couple of lines ?
[05:43:23] <nysos> $(document).ready(function () {
[05:43:24] <nysos>     $("#tabs").tabs({ ajaxOptions: { cookie: { expires: 1 } } }).find('ui-tabs-nav').sortable({ axis: 'x' });
[05:43:25] <nysos> });
[05:43:25] <nysos> $("#Btn_Reg").click(function(){
[05:43:25] <nysos>     $("#tabs").tabs({active: -1});
[05:43:25] <Cork> no
[05:43:25] <nysos> });
[05:43:28] <Cork> ?p
[05:43:29] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:43:33] <grafi> :|
[05:43:36] <nysos> well ops sorry for pasting code here
[05:43:50] <Trudko> Guys I have a bit of problem with how Jquery behave if I run some method on empty result of selector. If I use pure DOM api i get error so I know something is wrong(i am looking for element which isn't there) but jquery just silently let me get away with it.
[05:43:55] <Trudko> how do you deal with it?
[05:44:14] <Cork> Trudko: .length
[05:44:32] <nysos> please i am stuck with this problem for a couple of days
[05:44:33] <Cork> $('none-existing-element').length > 0
[05:45:17] <Trudko> Cork: well you woudnt do that for every selector woudl you
[05:45:24] <nysos> i have used ajaxOptions, but i think i need to include its jquery file? but i can't find it in anyfolders downloaded with jquery-ui
[05:45:35] <Cork> Trudko: if you need to know if the target element exist yes
[05:45:45] <Cork> Trudko: though normally jquery is written to just handle it
[05:46:12] <Cork> $('#not-here').addClass('something').css('color', 'blue'); dosen't fail
[05:46:32] <Cork> Trudko: and that is why it returns a valid jquery object even when nothing is found
[05:46:34] <Trudko> well if you know, I am interested in case where you do expect the element to exist but for typo lets say it isnt there. Not a huge problem but I am courious.
[05:46:55] <Cork> Trudko: then you need to check .length
[05:47:27] <Trudko> Cork: well I wouldnt to do that everytime I use selector, just to know right away if I made typo
[05:48:15] <Cork> Trudko: well you could overload jquery and do if(this.length > 0) { throw 'Unexpected empty array'; }
[05:48:24] <seutje> lol
[05:48:44] <raj> Cork, when a month from the dropdown menu is clicked, it usually refreshes the page
[05:48:48] <seutje> or you could just blow up half the web with TNT instead
[05:48:56] <Cork> Trudko: not sure what else you want me to tell you...
[05:48:57] <raj> but when I do `$("#sSelectCal option[value='7-2013']").prop('selected', true)`, it doesn't seem to refresh
[05:49:16] <lenswipee> hey, what's the quickest way to find the first sibling (label) above/upstream on the current one (<input>)
[05:49:29] <raj> lenswipee, .prev()
[05:49:40] <lenswipee> ok
[05:49:41] <Cork> raj: set var() on the select element, not the prob
[05:49:44] <Cork> *prop
[05:49:54] <Cork> uh... val >_<
[05:50:05] <raj> oh
[05:50:13] <Cork> raj: *set val() on the select element, not the prop on option
[05:50:21] <raj> just replace prop() with val()?
[05:50:26] <raj> or is it a different format?
[05:50:36] <Cork> `$("#sSelectCal").val('7-2013')
[05:50:44] <raj> oh, I see, bad question :)
[05:52:09] <Nancy2012> it is possible to change the form id by jquery. if yes, then how..???
[05:52:26] <Cork> $('form').atr('id'm 'new')
[05:52:33] <Cork> * $('form').atr('id', 'new')
[05:53:40] <Nancy2012> thanks.. let me see
[05:56:14] <Akkumulator> hello, i have a simple question: how can I select the elemnt itself and all its children? find('*') only holds the children. I want to perform a .each on all of them.
[05:56:35] <Cork> ?.andSelf @ Akkumulator
[05:56:35] <bot-t> Akkumulator, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[05:57:13] <seutje> find('*') does more than just grab direct children
[05:57:45] <Cork> was it about just direct children though?
[05:58:03] <Cork> if so then do $(this).children().andSelf()
[05:58:07] <Akkumulator> ok I wasnt clear enough. I wann all child nodes, not just the direct ones
[05:58:21] <Cork> ok, then find is the correct one
[05:58:32] <Akkumulator> thx for help :)
[05:58:52] <nysos> Cork any help pls ?
[05:59:08] <Cork> ?p @ nysos
[05:59:09] <bot-t> nysos, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:59:21] <nysos> ok
[05:59:22] <Akkumulator> btw .andSelf(): This function has been deprecated and is now an alias for .addBack(), which should be used with jQuery 1.8 and later.
[05:59:48] <Cork> O_o
[05:59:56] <Cork> ha, so it is
[06:00:13] <sammich> is there a list of every non-deprecrated jQuery method? I seem to find new ones every night here
[06:00:50] <lenswipee> hey, for a drop menu do i check <select> or the <option> for emptyness?
[06:00:58] <Cork> sammich: not as far as i know
[06:01:12] <sammich> well, I guess I better stick around here then :)
[06:01:27] <Cork> lenswipee: check for what?
[06:01:39] <Cork> a select element can't be empty
[06:01:48] <sammich> $('select :selected').val() === ''
[06:01:49] <Cork> there is always one option selected
[06:02:03] <lenswipee> Cork: Hey, trying to check if a select element has been selected.
[06:02:20] <Cork> lenswipee: you can't
[06:02:37] <Cork> or rather you need a "please select" option in there
[06:02:54] <Cork> and have <option value="">Please pick an option</option>
[06:03:02] <lenswipee> Cork: i do have one of those
[06:03:04] <Cork> and then yes you can check $('select').val()
[06:03:16] <Cork> if($('select').val() == '') {}
[06:03:34] <nysos> hey , to put simply this is the problem
[06:03:37] <nysos> http://jsfiddle.net/LKAvY/
[06:03:37] <lenswipee> Cork: okay
[06:04:04] <nysos> on clicking submit on tab 2 it will refresh the page and tab 1 will be selected
[06:04:38] <nysos> so how can i keep it from refreshing the page and keeping the same tab
[06:05:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LKAvY/2/
[06:05:02] <nysos> i found somewhere to use ajaxOptions
[06:05:22] <Cork> you will have to keep the hash from the current tab in the url
[06:05:46] <nysos> what ?
[06:05:54] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/LKAvY/2/show/#tab2
[06:07:52] <nysos> Cork : what did you change in the code , i didn't understand
[06:08:52] <Cork> nysos: check the url
[06:09:00] <nysos> i checked
[06:09:09] <Cork> what i changed in the code was only to include jquery ui so the page works
[06:09:30] <Cork> but what i meant was use the hash from the current tab
[06:09:41] <Cork> if the page reloads you need to tell the new page what tab to show
[06:09:53] <Cork> or use ajax instead of a standard form
[06:10:47] <nysos> i found somewhere :$("#tabs").tabs({ ajaxOptions: { cookie: { expires: 1 } } });
[06:11:15] <nysos> but can't find jquery.cookie.js file in any folder
[06:12:34] <Cork> it's not part of jquery
[06:12:43] <Cork> it's a plugin
[06:12:54] <Cork> and i think you need a plugin to connect it to tabs
[06:13:15] <mzxx> please help. http://jsfiddle.net/mzxx/zjKub/   jQuery 1.9.1 not work, 1.8.3 work! I have 1.9.1
[06:13:21] <nysos> ohh ok, the video said it will be in the development\external folder
[06:13:41] <lenswipee> Cork, can this be simplified? see http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/
[06:13:44] <Cork> ?.prop @ mzxx
[06:13:44] <bot-t> mzxx, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:13:56] <nysos> Cork, will this work ? $("#Btn_Reg").click(function(){
[06:13:56] <nysos>     $("#tabs").tabs({active: -1});
[06:13:56] <nysos> });
[06:14:09] <lenswipee> Cork, particularly the two .each()
[06:15:00] <mzxx> Cork: thx :)
[06:15:36] <Cork> lenswipee: not really
[06:16:02] <Cork> you could replace the each loop with filter(function() { return $(this).val() == ''; }) if you like
[06:16:08] <Cork> but it doesn't make that much difference
[06:16:32] <lenswipee> Cork, how you mean?
[06:17:36] <lenswipee> Cork, but i have more than one input and select that's why i used .each()
[06:18:35] <Cork> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/1/
[06:18:42] <Cork> opps
[06:18:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/2/
[06:19:13] <Cork> and actually...
[06:19:39] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/3/
[06:21:25] <lenswipee> Cork: and you said it couldn't be combined :D. definately shorter,w hich i like alot
[06:22:05] <Cork> lenswipee: well the two loops did the same thing
[06:22:22] <lenswipee> Cork: what does '|=" mean?
[06:22:38] <Cork> ?eval var a = false; a |= true; a
[06:22:41] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[06:22:45] <Cork> O_o
[06:22:48] <Cork> oook
[06:22:56] <Cork> ?eval var a = true; a |= false; a
[06:22:56] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[06:23:02] <Cork> ?eval var a = false; a |= false; a
[06:23:02] <bot-t> Cork: 0
[06:23:26] <Cork> |= is basically a short for a = a | result;
[06:23:40] <Cork> ah, wait
[06:23:46] <Cork> ?eval var a = true; a ||= false; a
[06:23:46] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: syntax error
[06:23:49] <Cork> nope
[06:24:31] <Cork> on the other hand you don't need the has_error variable anymore
[06:25:12] <lenswipee> i don't?
[06:25:28] <lenswipee> i use it in //output
[06:25:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/4/
[06:26:28] <Cork> bah indentation error
[06:26:38] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/5/
[06:27:51] <Cork> lenswipee: also i would move the message out into the html
[06:27:58] <Cork> and just have js show it if it fails
[06:28:07] <Cork> that would simplify the code even more
[06:28:23] <lenswipee> Cork: as in an alert?
[06:28:28] <Cork> no
[06:28:56] <lenswipee> Cork: the message does go to html as i use .html()
[06:29:22] <Cork> #report { display: none; } #report.has_error { display: block; } <p id="report">Check the highlighted fields below.</p>
[06:29:40] <Cork> or if you have multiple messages
[06:30:42] <lenswipee> Cork: you can do that in the css file?
[06:30:44] <Cork> #report span { display: none; } #report.has_error .error { display: block; } #report.no_error .success { display: block; } <p id="report"><span class="error">Check the highlighted fields below.</span><span class="success"></span></p>
[06:30:52] <Cork> the first part is for the css
[06:30:57] <Cork> the second is for the html file
[06:32:17] <lenswipee> Cork: right i get you
[06:32:36] <lenswipee> Cork: not bad not bad...
[06:32:55] <Cork> of you do that then you can do
[06:33:19] <Cork> $('#report').toggleClass('has_error', has_error);
[06:33:24] <Cork> no need for the if case
[06:34:20] <lenswipee> Cork: that is your recommendation?
[06:34:22] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gbP8W/6/
[06:34:25] <Cork> ya
[06:34:40] <Cork> lenswipee: also never put the element infront of an id
[06:34:54] <Cork> you're only creating a slower selector for no reason
[06:35:05] <lenswipee> what element?
[06:35:21] <Cork> $( 'p#report' ) => $( '#report' )
[06:35:51] <lenswipee> right
[06:36:00] <Cork> the id is uniq by definition
[06:36:09] <Cork> no need to have the element filter there
[06:36:11] <lenswipee> sure thing.
[06:39:50] <lenswipee> Cork: i don't understand the use of length > 0;
[06:40:01] <lenswipee> Cork: in the code
[06:40:19] <Cork> lenswipee: .filter will remove all none error us elements from the selection
[06:40:34] <Cork> so if you have any errors it means the array is bigger then 0
[06:44:22] <lenswipee> var result is an array?
[06:44:42] <Cork> no
[06:45:02] <Cork> ?eval var result = [].length > 0; result
[06:45:03] <bot-t> Cork: false
[06:45:09] <Cork> ?eval var result = ['something'].length > 0; result
[06:45:13] <bot-t> Cork: true
[06:46:25] <lenswipee> i didn;t know the filter function returns an array
[06:46:40] <lenswipee> holding true/false values
[06:48:01] <Cork> ...
[06:48:02] <Cork> no
[06:48:13] <Cork> ?.filter @ lenswipee
[06:48:14] <bot-t> lenswipee, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:49:35] <lenswipee> then where is this array from?
[06:49:50] <Cork> jquery is an array like object
[06:49:59] <Cork> so it has a length member
[06:50:48] <lenswipee> but what are you explicitly checking for in length?
[06:50:54] <lenswipee> the match?
[06:51:05] <Cork> the number of matches yes
[06:52:55] <lenswipee> that is returned by the filter function or the selector?
[06:53:05] <lenswipee> or both
[06:54:32] <sammich> the filter function uses the selector...
[06:54:40] <sammich> in it's argument
[06:56:00] <lenswipee> a bit confusing
[06:57:04] <Cork> sammich: no
[06:57:11] <Cork> filter takes both a string or a function
[06:57:29] <Cork> sammich: if you give it a function it will execute it for each element in the array, just like each does
[06:57:48] <sammich> my bad, misread that last line
[06:57:50] <Cork> with the difference in that only elements where you return true will be in the new array
[06:58:08] <lenswipee> so the filter fucnction returns a jquery object, not a true/false value correct?
[06:58:29] <gnarf> lenswipee: yup, .is( selector ) returns a bool
[06:58:53] <lenswipee> right
[06:58:56] <gnarf> if at least one of the elements in the set matches
[07:00:42] <lenswipee> right, when i saw "return" i immediately thought it returned a bool
[07:22:01] <lmao24> anyone do consulting / help?
[07:47:15] <_jo_> lmao24: I'm a consultant.
[07:47:27] <_jo_> (Actually, a contractor.)
[07:53:38] <str8uplinux> how would i go about returning the variable NAME that has the greatest value?
[08:01:31] <lhunath> how do I know whether a $(selector) matched any elements at all?
[08:01:33] <_jo_> str8uplinux: How do you have your variables laid out?
[08:01:50] <_jo_> lhunath: $(selector).length?
[08:01:58] <lhunath> oh so it's an array?  okay.
[08:02:17] <_jo_> Yes.
[08:03:36] <lhunath> can I do something like $(selector || otherSelectorInCaseFirstSelectorHasNoMatches), or do I need an if?
[08:04:10] <_jo_> Not quite.
[08:04:29] <_jo_> You _can_ do an OR in the selector, but you can't do an IF THEN.
[08:05:17] <_jo_> I think JS supports the trinary if, so you might be able to do var foo = $(selector).length ? $(selector) : $(otherSelctor);
[08:05:24] <_jo_> Which is profoundly ugly.
[08:05:30] <_jo_> I'd go with the if just for readability and sanity.
[08:05:58] <lhunath> yeah, and I don't really want to run $(selector) twice
[08:06:09] <shoky> you don't need to
[08:06:33] <_jo_> If you don't care if the selector contains elements of both, you _can_ combine the selectors internally.
[08:06:52] <lhunath> I suppose I don't.
[08:06:58] <shoky> var foo = $(selector), bar = foo.length ? foo : $(otherSelector);
[08:07:53] <lhunath> how do you combine '#myname' and '[name=myname]' ?
[08:08:07] <shoky> combine how?
[08:08:18] <lhunath> as in, select all elements that match either.
[08:08:35] <lhunath> like _jo_ suggested.
[08:08:36] <shoky> a comma is OR
[08:08:41] <lhunath> oh, okay.
[08:08:46] <shoky> $('#myname, [name=myname]')
[08:08:55] <grafi> OR is it
[08:09:15] <shoky> but remember that the [name=myname] is same as *[name=myname] which is very inefficient
[08:09:18] <lhunath> so, I can do $(href + ',name="' + href.substr(1) + '"]')
[08:09:24] <lhunath> err, missing [
[08:09:44] <lhunath> I suppose I can put an a in front.
[08:10:31] <shoky> you can also just use .add() to not make the selector so bulky
[08:10:33] <lhunath> if the a[name] search is expensive, I should only do it if the # search fails to find the element.
[08:11:00] <shoky> $(href).add('a[name="' + href.substr(1) + '"]')
[08:11:56] <lhunath> how worried should I be that this allows injection (eg. user putting a hash of moo]sneakystuff)
[08:12:13] <lhunath> I don't suppose it can do much harm
[08:12:24] <shoky> user can delete the DOM if they want
[08:12:25] <shoky> their problem
[08:13:29] <smggg> hello?
[08:13:51] <shoky> yes?
[08:14:45] <lhunath> can I shorten this (eg. by doing what the function does in the selector instead)? $('a[href]').filter(function() { return $.attr(this, 'href').match(/^#/); })
[08:15:55] <shoky> $('a[href^="#"]')  i think
[08:17:35] <Lightsaber> hi
[08:17:41] <graphettion> yo
[08:18:20] <Lightsaber> how r u shoky?
[08:18:52] <shoky> Lightsaber: ok & starving. yourself?
[08:19:04] <graphettion> Not bad jQuery - http://jsfiddle.net/V3N6U/
[08:19:28] <Lightsaber> shoky: fine thx :)
[08:19:44] <shoky> graphettion that's really not a fair comparison at all
[08:19:53] <Lightsaber> is there anything like a global variable in a jQuery?
[08:19:57] <graphettion> shoky: What is one?
[08:20:33] <graphettion> jQuery still didn't do that bad. 400ms.
[08:20:40] <graphettion> give or take
[08:23:20] <shoky> graphettion: fine, nevermind :P
[08:23:31] <graphettion> shoky: ty :)
[08:23:59] <graphettion> I'm not ragging on it. I'm saying it's not bad for what it does.
[08:26:48] <graphettion> Now press it! - http://sadtrombone.com/
[08:26:51] <graphettion> lol jk
[08:27:17] <shoky> heh
[08:28:00] <shoky> Lightsaber: jQuery doesn't have variables (it's not a programming language). javascript does, the global scope is the "window" object
[08:28:09] <graphettion> Nah, you're usually right. I had to point out a flaw to see if you're human.
[08:30:24] <utroda> is there a better way to do this? - uri = uri.replace('{{state}}', state).replace('{{postal}}', postal).replace('{{city}}', city);
[08:33:00] <Cork> utroda: no not really
[08:35:00] <utroda> Cork: okay
[08:38:25] <Somatt_wrk> Any idea why ('#caseWrapper').css('minHeight','auto'); wouldn't work in Chrome ?
[08:38:34] <Somatt_wrk> $('#caseWrapper').css('background','#eee'); works fine for example
[08:38:57] <Somatt_wrk> 'min-height' doesn't work either
[08:39:24] <Cork> ?demo
[08:39:24] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[08:40:30] <BillCriswell> Somatt_wrk: You probably want .css('minHeight', 0)
[08:40:59] <Somatt_wrk> do'h
[08:41:09] <Somatt_wrk> thanks BillCriswell
[08:41:20] <BillCriswell> I probably would have tried auto right off the bat as well. =)
[08:41:23] <Somatt_wrk> I come to hate firefox for fixing my mistakes
[08:41:24] <shoky> 0 is auto?
[08:41:41] <BillCriswell> min-heights default value is 0, not auto.
[08:41:45] <Somatt_wrk> shoky: minimum 0
[08:41:55] <shoky> oh do'h
[08:42:21] <Somatt_wrk> yeah, it was a typo on my side, but several brosers made it work anyhow :/
[08:43:43] <BillCriswell> yeah, i guess chrome doesn't give you that kind of flexibility there.
[08:46:01] <BillCriswell> Did 0 work across the board Somatt_wrk?
[08:46:43] <Somatt_wrk> BillCriswell: there's no reason for it not to work, that the value it should have had in the first place
[08:47:07] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but browsers are a pain in the ass sometimes haha
[08:47:53] <Somatt_wrk> ^^
[08:48:21] <PhaseCode> Hey guys'

[08:49:18] <charpandnl> he there!
[08:50:09] <charpandnl> i'm thinking about distributing my widgets and plugins, but don't know how atm...
[08:50:23] <Somatt_wrk> github ?
[08:50:27] <charpandnl> does someone have and idea?
[08:50:46] <gry> evidently yes
[08:51:19] <charpandnl> meh... I don't won't the source to be editable / public hosted... only the compiled libs will be there (some sort of company policy)
[08:53:15] <PhaseCode> Okay, so I'm converting the table cells in my table to textboxs debugging shows it working, up until the last step it converts all the values to http://gyazo.com/5d49ae888dae5f3bd9b46e5d71d0ae98.png
[08:53:47] <BillCriswell> Are you using .text() instead of .html() PhaseCode?
[08:54:03] <PhaseCode> Nope, let me try that
[08:54:22] <BillCriswell> That confused me.
[08:54:39] <PhaseCode> BillCriswell:http://pastebin.com/Xvw7W4RZ my code, im going to change it and try it right now
[08:55:12] <PhaseCode> Now it goes blank :(
[08:55:35] <PhaseCode> http://gyazo.com/6556946d6a0c5c0e8d156b26e32cb540.png
[08:56:49] <BillCriswell> You are using .html(). Do you have any plugins running on the table that might conflict with what you're trying to do?
[08:57:15] <BillCriswell> oh wait
[08:57:31] <PhaseCode> I don't think so: http://gyazo.com/6addc0e5ec1051117800a24214a80d6d.png here it is in the debugger working fine up until a last step where it clears everything
[08:58:48] <BillCriswell> Is anything run after this look?
[08:58:50] <BillCriswell> loop*
[08:59:09] <PhaseCode> I think so, but nothing dealing with the table.
[09:00:23] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/exexob/1/edit here is just your code isolated.
[09:00:30] <BillCriswell> ( for the most part )
[09:01:41] <wcwrel> anyone here use xchart ?
[09:01:51] <BillCriswell> It does work as I expected it. So I think there's something else going on.
[09:03:09] <cusco> hey... I'm having trouble with $'(form[selector]').submit(function(){performing here})
[09:03:30] <cusco> when I click the submit button its not executing steps inside the .submit(function)
[09:03:39] <cusco> common reasons for this?
[09:04:15] <PhaseCode> Hmm, it seems like you're right BillCriswell: any idea why its doing this?
[09:09:23] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode: I wish I could look at your code without seeing it. =)
[09:12:54] <BillCriswell> cusco: You could be trying to attach it before jQuery knows it exists. You could be using a wrong selector.
[09:13:09] <PhaseCode> BillCriswell: Ugh, I wish but its meshed together with a MVC and it's a pain in the ass trying to get anything to work
[09:13:48] <BillCriswell> any other events attached to the #Edit?
[09:14:30] <Lightsaber> Ä± am getting data with $.getjson in real-time. Ä± am assigning this data to a variable in $.getjson function. but this variable is undefined so Ä± am not using this variable out of $.getjson function . That's why Ä± must assign data a variable like a global variable..
[09:15:13] <PhaseCode> Nope
[09:15:17] <PhaseCode> its a button
[09:17:08] <kba> I'm using jquery.hotkeys (https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys(), but I can't get it working for the keys I want.
[09:17:15] <kba> $(document).bind('keydown', 'left', function(e) { works, but ctrl+p for instance doesn't.
[09:17:29] <kba> The example in the README on GitHub uses ctrl+a. That doesn't work either.
[09:17:32] <kba> Any ideas why?
[09:18:04] <Lightsaber> kba: every keys have to a ascii code. use these.
[09:19:05] <Cork> ya, that plugin has never worked reliably for me either
[09:19:14] <kba> This is using4the hotkeys plugin, Lightsaber, hence why I should use the actual character.
[09:19:17] <PhaseCode> WHoAH
[09:19:18] <Cork> and it's not really needed either way
[09:19:27] <kba> Hm.

[09:20:34] <JimmyXander> I have a question. Last week I build a filterable portfolio system for a client. Now they are asking to add a feature. They want to change the text on the page based on which category is selected. Now I have no problem implementing this feature, but I can't decide exactly which method would be best. Should I pull the content from an xml file on request, should I load it with the page, hide it with jquery and then show it on request
[09:20:34] <JimmyXander> is there another method I am not thinking of?
[09:20:44] <hye> Cork i tried mouse leave. it stil wont work
[09:21:09] <hye> the mouseleave hides it Cork
[09:21:14] <Cork> hye: mouseleave shouldn't trigger when you move the mouse onto the child

[09:21:59] <Cork> ?p @ hye
[09:21:59] <bot-t> hye, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:22:02] <hye> specifically its a <button> that i hover over that is in the inner div
[09:22:12] <Cork> then the second div isn't a child
[09:22:54] <Lightsaber> is there anybody tÄ± help me?
[09:23:25] <Lightsaber> tÄ± = to
[09:23:27] <Cork> Lightsaber: could you reduce that question to a more straight up question?
[09:23:48] <hye> Cork they are child's.. ill do a pastebin soon, short on time... but would positoin: relative make it act screwy?
[09:23:55] <JimmyXander> Did I cause TLDR?
[09:23:57] <Lightsaber> Cork: Ä± am getting data with $.getjson in real-time. Ä± am assigning this data to a variable in $.getjson function. but this variable is undefined so Ä± am not using this variable out of $.getjson function . That's why Ä± must assign data a variable like a global variable.. what should Ä± do?
[09:24:03] <hye> or absolute positioning
[09:24:25] <Cork> JimmyXander: ya, twice...
[09:25:26] <Cork> Lightsaber: i think the core of the problem is that you think ajax is syncronous
[09:25:29] <JimmyXander> Okay. Replacing the content inside of a div. Which is the best method. Loading and replacing html from an xml file, or preloading the content into the html, hiding it and showing it on request?
[09:25:52] <Cork> Lightsaber: code after the call will execute BEFORE the call returns
[09:26:08] <Cork> Lightsaber: so you can't access something you set inside the callback below the call
[09:26:14] <JimmyXander> I'm more asking advice, than for a solution to a problem really.
[09:26:43] <PhaseCode> Any idea guys?
[09:27:08] <Cork> JimmyXander: depends on the amount of html
[09:27:17] <JimmyXander> three <p>
[09:27:24] <Cork> JimmyXander: if it is just a little ya, hiding is worth it
[09:27:25] <JimmyXander> p*3
[09:27:31] <JimmyXander> okay
[09:27:31] <JimmyXander> thnx
[09:27:50] <Cork> PhaseCode: idea for what?
[09:28:33] <staafl> how can I get the newly created element from .append()?
[09:28:58] <gry> can you create it first, then pass it to append?
[09:29:13] <PhaseCode> Cork: I'm trying to edit a table to make it turn into text areas. http://jsbin.com/exexob/2/edit it works fine here, however when I try and deploy it to our production server clicking edit makes the text blank as if I've hit edit twice on jsbin
[09:29:17] <bobbobbins> hey, i have a set of radio buttons, and I need to see if any of them are selectedâ€¦my radio button is being referenced with $(this)â€¦how can I do that?
[09:29:23] <kba> I just did it all manually, that works. Stupid plugin. Thanks!
[09:29:41] <PhaseCode> Cork: Debugging shows the values show up but the last call inside jQuery clears everything... :(
[09:29:45] <Lightsaber> Cork: ok,what should i do?
[09:29:54] <gry> staafl: foo = ...; bar.append(foo); ..... then bar holds the new bar, and foo still holds whatever you appended ?
[09:30:20] <staafl> gry, thanks
[09:30:51] <gry> welcome
[09:31:05] <aro> does anyone know a way to create something like the header on google+ profile pages?
[09:32:55] <bobbobbins> anyone know
[09:33:52] <PhaseCode> Cork: What do you think?
[09:34:31] <charpandnl> thnx cmn
[09:34:34] <charpandnl> got it running
[09:34:46] <charpandnl> dunno why I could get it to work last times :S
[09:35:52] <Lightsaber> Cork are you there?
[09:37:48] <user_corrupt> I am a javascipt beginner and I am writing a very small script... when the page is scrolled then the window height is calculated and stored in a variable... i have another line of code that changes the css height of a specific div, and I need to figure out how to make it use that variable, but im having trouble with the syntax... here is my little script: http://pastebin.com/gnh7Ejv9
[09:41:04] <Rodrigo_Debian> alguem fala portugues ?
[09:41:31] <Saaether> user_corrupt $('.widget-area').css({height: windowHeight });
[09:43:04] <user_corrupt> Saaether: emberassingly simple, thanks man
[09:43:16] <Saaether> ;)
[09:45:29] <Saaether> user_corrupt: thats the answer to your question, although your example doesnt make much sense. If you want to adjust the size of a div to match the size of your window, i wouldnt do that on scroll, id do it on window resize
[09:45:45] <PhaseCode> Anybody that can help?
[09:46:10] <Saaether> PhaseCode whats the problem?
[09:46:30] <PhaseCode> Saaether: I'm trying to edit a table to make it turn into text areas. http://jsbin.com/exexob/2/edit it works fine here, however when I try and deploy it to our production server clicking edit makes the text blank as if I've hit edit twice on jsbin
[09:47:13] <PhaseCode> Saaether: it works in debug http://gyazo.com/6addc0e5ec1051117800a24214a80d6d.png but then it jumps to the internal jQuery call and clears everything
[09:47:32] <user_corrupt> Saaether: actually my approach is messed up... im trying to make a div grow in height as I scroll father down the page.. i need some other method..
[09:48:04] <Saaether> user_corrupt you dont want $(window).height then as that will only change when you change the height of your browser
[09:48:59] <Saaether> err wait, youd want to use window height + scroll distance
[09:50:33] <PhaseCode> Any idea Saaether?
[09:53:51] <andre_pl> is there a way I can check an http status code on an external image?
[10:02:28] <gvilla23> Who can I speak to about hosting a company sponsored jQuery Meet-Up?
[10:03:49] <maxmoore14> general question for everyone... what do you think is the best file format to use if I want to allow users to "export" some of their data and save it as a file. All the data is text. Certainly docx is an option. Do you think rtf is a better choice? Avoiding plain text because I want to pretty it up a a bit.
[10:08:40] <PhaseCode> Well seems like I fixed my issue
[10:12:39] <bobbobbins> how do I check if no checkboxes on my entire page are checked? I tried this: $("input[type='checkbox']:checked").length <= 0)
[10:13:54] <BillCriswell> bobbobbins: if( $(':checked').length === 0 ) {...} should wor.
[10:13:56] <BillCriswell> work*
[10:14:03] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode: Awesome. =D
[10:14:07] <bobbobbins> let me try that then
[10:18:00] <PhaseCode> To All: I was wondering if I had two tables for example: entity_round_1 and entity_round_2 is it possible to get both without having to hard code both table names?
[10:18:36] <bobbobbins> ugh, there were two hidden checkboxes that were checked for some odd reason
[10:23:44] <BillCriswell> bobbobbins: Haha.
[10:23:58] <BillCriswell> :visible:checked
[10:24:10] <bobbobbins> yup, that took care of it, thanks
[10:24:29] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode: You should probably give them a class. If it's not an option table[id^=entity_round_] should do the trick.
[10:26:51] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[10:32:16] <sl33k_> How do I prevent form submit? I used $id.attr(disabled) but I would not like blur the button.
[10:35:12] <BillCriswell> sl33k_: You have to run preventDefault() on the event object.
[10:35:36] <BillCriswell> sl33k_: So like.. $('form').on('submit', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[10:36:13] <PhaseCode> BillCriswell: Do you want to know how I fixed my problem?
[10:36:26] <BillCriswell> Sure thing.
[10:36:41] <PhaseCode> I had echo'ed out two seperate jQuery js files
[10:36:47] <sl33k_> BillCriswell: Wow. Thanks a bunch!
[10:36:55] <PhaseCode> It was calling every method twice'
[10:37:06] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[10:37:16] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode: Ahhh, damn.
[11:05:48] <engaged> is there a reason why the color isn't changing on this: $("#skiplink").animate({

[11:05:49] <engaged> 	});
[11:07:45] <skamikaze> engaged: you may need jqueryui => http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[11:08:02] <stefuNz> engaged: plain jquery doesn't support color animation
[11:08:07] <engaged> oh
[11:08:08] <engaged> crap

[11:20:00] <defaultro> hey guys, what die would you suggest other than Eclipse? I like the feature in Rubymine editor where I can right-click a method/function and it can bring me to the declaration which also helps me to learn how files are called or connected.
[11:20:39] <shoky> defaultro if you like rubymine then you'll probably like WebStorm
[11:20:55] <defaultro> ok. Is it free?
[11:21:07] <shoky> as free as rubymine
[11:21:17] <defaultro> my ruby mine is not free :(
[11:21:21] <shoky> ;[
[11:21:33] <shoky> there's a free edition iirc
[11:21:40] <defaultro> ok
[11:22:14] <defaultro> are you using web storm?
[11:22:48] <shoky> sometimes
[11:26:47] <baordog> I want to send a variable from javascript to my php webserver. Will $.post do it?
[11:27:04] <baordog> All the examples seem to be about retrieving data to put back in the DOM.
[11:28:02] <shoky> baordog: $.post or $.ajax will do it, sure.  (not send a variable per se, but send data)
[11:28:21] <shoky> see the 'data' argument/option
[11:28:40] <baordog> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ - the first jquery example involves retrieving a page snippet though.
[11:28:53] <shoky> so?
[11:29:21] <baordog> well that's retrieving not sending. I'm most confused. it sends *and* receives?
[11:29:29] <shoky> yes
[11:29:33] <Saaether> it is sending data to the server and getting a response
[11:29:36] <shoky> sends a request, receives a response
[11:29:40] <PhaseCode> if I have <input class="editField" type="text" value="1">
[11:29:44] <PhaseCode> how would I get the value?
[11:29:55] <PhaseCode> Becuase .val doesn't work
[11:30:04] <PhaseCode> do I have to use .attr?
[11:30:33] <shoky> .val()
[11:30:33] <b-ot> shoky: for form fields
[11:30:43] <Eviltwin> ...
[11:31:07] <Eviltwin> I guess . is a b-ot triggee
[11:31:11] <Eviltwin> trigger*
[11:31:26] <shoky> most anything is b-ot trigger :\
[11:31:46] <shoky> b-ot: forget .val()
[11:31:58] <shoky> b-ot, forget .val()
[11:32:06] <shoky> `forget .val()
[11:32:09] <shoky> :\
[11:32:18] <Eviltwin> I think "shoky:" is a b-ot trigger
[11:32:35] <Eviltwin> And I haven't figured out how to chabge any of the responses
[11:32:54] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[11:32:54] <b-ot> Eviltwin: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[11:33:01] <shoky> wat
[11:33:16] <Eviltwin> You'll notice those are slightly different
[11:33:32] <Eviltwin> The bot-t one pushes jsFiddle a little more
[11:33:51] <Saaether> `api on @ Eviltwin
[11:33:51] <b-ot> Eviltwin: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:33:52] <PhaseCode> Object <input class="editField" type="text" value="1"> has no method 'val' when calling $(this).html().val(); and when calling $(this).val() its blank
[11:34:01] <Saaether> only 1 responds to ` commands
[11:34:15] <shoky> PhaseCode: .html() returns an html string, not a jquery object
[11:34:26] <shoky> PhaseCode: er $(this).val() should work
[11:34:39] <Eviltwin> Saaether: I want to change what b-ot says for `demo
[11:34:40] <shoky> PhaseCode: assuming you didn't change the value
[11:34:47] <Eviltwin> And I don't know how to do that
[11:35:05] <shoky> .forget .val()
[11:35:11] <shoky> .blarg is blarg
[11:35:18] <shoky> meh

[11:39:18] <PhaseCode> b-ot: http://jsbin.com/exexob/3/edit
[11:39:35] <PhaseCode> Click edit, then click save
[11:39:43] <PhaseCode> I'm trying to get the value when you click save :)
[11:40:13] <shoky> PhaseCode: you're doing .each on <td>'s
[11:41:01] <PhaseCode> Yes, I have to revert the textbox's back to a table
[11:41:09] <shoky> PhaseCode: nevermind. show what you're doing that isn't working
[11:41:28] <PhaseCode> you see in the code wehre I say //NEED THE VALUE
[11:41:31] <shoky> why are you creating new inputs when clicking save?
[11:41:37] <shoky> i see it. comments aren't code
[11:41:56] <PhaseCode> Woops I ment to get rid of that code inside the .each
[11:42:39] <PhaseCode> http://jsbin.com/exexob/7/edit here it is with the code gone :)
[11:42:51] <shoky> PhaseCode: what's not working?
[11:43:56] <PhaseCode> shoky: I don't know how to get the value of the textbox
[11:43:57] <baordog> so does $().post take a variable as the data or a function... or...?
[11:44:29] <shoky> PhaseCode: you need to select/find the textbox and call .val() on it
[11:44:54] <Saaether> PhaseCode http://jsbin.com/exexob/9/edit ?
[11:44:57] <shoky> baordog: what do the docs say?
[11:45:15] <baordog> They say it takes "data"
[11:45:22] <rebelyell> hey quick question
[11:45:25] <rebelyell> how can i do         $(this).nextAll('.action').toggle(400);
[11:45:29] <shoky> baordog: also, the docs for $.ajax have the full details
[11:45:37] <shoky> baordog: $.post is just a shortcut for $.ajax
[11:45:45] <rebelyell> but do nextAll('.action') before it hits something
[11:45:52] <rebelyell> so before it hits the next year
[11:45:58] <shoky> baordog: they say more than "it takes data"
[11:46:19] <shoky> baordog:  data  Type: PlainObject or String    A plain object or string that is sent to the server with the request.
[11:46:20] <rebelyell> $(this).nextAll('.action').until('.year').toggle(400);
[11:46:21] <PhaseCode> shoky: I love you <3
[11:47:09] <rebelyell> is there such a thing
[11:47:13] <BillCriswell> rebelyell: nextall('.action.year') ?
[11:47:29] <rebelyell> well no
[11:47:39] <rebelyell> i want it to stop when it comes to the next year
[11:47:46] <shoky> ?nextUntil
[11:47:46] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[11:48:07] <rebelyell> let me try
[11:48:10] <BillCriswell> rebelyell: nextAll('.action.year').eq(0) ?
[11:48:18] <BillCriswell> Ah, nextUntil seems better.
[11:48:30] <shoky> would need to .filter() it afterwards i guess
[11:48:31] <BillCriswell> Haven't used it before.
[11:48:54] <shoky> e.g.  .nextUntil('.year').filter('.action')  or something
[11:53:14] <rebelyell> yea
[11:53:16] <rebelyell> that worked
[11:53:19] <rebelyell> thanks so much guys!!
[11:59:39] <baordog> shoky: OK I'm making progress with this - http://pastie.org/8087055 - any idea what's wrong?
[11:59:48] <Sirisian|Work_> Maybe this is obvious, but is it easy to make jqueryui work with touch events? Like just pass in event: "tap" as an option to accordion or something?
[12:01:05] <shoky> baordog: $.post("picture", {dataUrl: dataUrl})
[12:02:32] <baordog> Still forbidden :(
[12:03:03] <shoky> baordog: that's a serverside issue
[12:03:50] <shoky> check your server/php error logs or whatever
[12:04:20] <shoky> is that url even correct? "picture"
[12:04:48] <relix> hey guys, using jquery 1.9, in safari on a retina macbook, I'm using animate({top:120px}) to animate an absolutely positioned box downward. The javascript does fine - i.e. every 16ms or so the top is increased, and using timeline recording I can see that also "layout" and "recalculate style" actions are done in the browser, however during the whole animation (500ms or so), it's only painted once, resulting in a very stuttery animation (basically
[12:04:48] <relix>  it jumps to the target in two frames)
[12:05:48] <baordog> shoky:  appears to be in firebug I see  http://mysite.com/uploads/picture
[12:06:03] <shoky> baordog: what?
[12:06:16] <shoky> baordog: you wrote the url "picture"  that seems fine..
[12:06:35] <baordog> That's what I meant, it seems like a valid URL.
[12:06:38] <shoky> oh
[12:06:52] <shoky> welp, check the issue serverside
[12:06:54] <baordog> picture being the function in my controller I'm trying to reference.
[12:07:09] <shoky> your server is responding with 403
[12:07:52] <baordog> I mean, that makes sense. Not just anyone should be able to post to the server. Could it because I have my site locked with .htpassword?
[12:08:26] <shoky> could be, i dunno
[12:08:57] <shoky> check your logs..
[12:09:57] <chilversc> anyone remember the url for a site that could show you the NFA graph for a regex using only javascript and canvas?

[12:37:54] <guhcampos> Hmmm BillCriswell I really enjoyed the philosophy of Globalize, being a full locale setting and so, I'd expect something like that, but moment and numeral look great. I'll take a deeper look, thanks =)
[12:40:04] <diphtherial> actually, i think i'll do the parsing on the server side

[12:52:20] <guhcampos>  
[13:01:42] <chilversc> I was starting to think I had dreamt that regex site, but finally found it after much greping http://www.debuggex.com/
[13:03:01] <Cryp71c> For jquery mobile, is it necessary to use attributes like 'data-role' ?
[13:03:48] <aditsu> hi, is there a jquery confirm dialog implementation that blocks and returns a value, rather than using a callback?
[13:04:37] <skamikaze> aditsu: welcome to javascript :)
[13:05:10] <aditsu> skamikaze: ok.....?
[13:05:12] <freebir> hi
[13:06:01] <skamikaze> aditsu: don't think so - but jqueryui's implementation of $.dialog is pretty easy
[13:06:06] <baordog> shoky:  I got it working. Quick question about security: What keeps someone from uploading a malicious script this way? You think if someone somehow made the file name .php.jpg it would somehow run?
[13:07:14] <aditsu> skamikaze: the thing is I want to do a confirm on a <button> and return false for canceling the submission
[13:08:05] <skamikaze> aditsu: prevent the submit any time and submit the form yourself when the dialog gets closed
[13:08:22] <skamikaze> baordog: validate the input
[13:13:21] <freebir> you guys, I need some help please, I've this wesite, I want to open the 'clinica' link the same way I open the 'HOME' link, but I wish it was a different page, I've created an equal div, with different name, and tryed to call, but wont work, help please :http://lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/
[13:13:41] <Sirisian|Work> Does the Jquery ui accordion allow nested accordions to fill the height? http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/38/ I made two nested accordions and they don't fill the height.
[13:13:57] <freebir> I wish to be open as many pages I want, not only 1, my website has many links
[13:14:10] <freebir> now, both open the same page
[13:17:05] <slax0r> freebir, can you pastebin the code you're using to open this stuff?
[13:17:31] <freebir> slacko, sure, 1 sec
[13:18:26] <freebir> slax0r, http://pastebin.com/mMn1D1QJ
[13:18:34] <freebir> slax0r, link Home and Clinica,
[13:18:55] <aditsu> skamikaze: so I just submit the form in javascript, in the callback? how to set the "submitting button"?
[13:19:05] <freebir> I've 2 areas, but I can't find a way to be able to call them separately
[13:21:03] <skamikaze> aditsu: all you need is http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/ to prevent the submit when triggered by enter/submit button and $(".formselector").get(0).submit()
[13:21:08] <freebir> slax0r, so now I've 2 equal areas, <div id="myModal" class="reveal-modal">, in this page I showed it to you, I wish they could have different names and be called from different links
[13:22:35] <grafi> first of all they should have different ids ...
[13:22:46] <slax0r> freebir, don't know if this will help, but if nothing more, it'll fix a html validation error, yo uhave 2 divs with id "myModal", change one to myModal2(on clinica i.e.) and also then in the menu, change data-reveal-id(or something) change to myModal2 on clinica
[13:23:43] <grafi> exactly :)
[13:24:54] <aditsu> hm.. really not possible to block like the original confirm? :/
[13:24:54] <shoky> baordog: not sure what you mean..
[13:25:16] <slax0r> and remember, ID must be unique per HTML document posted to the browser, that's why it is an ID...
[13:26:39] <slax0r> aditsu you block it with "event.preventDefault"
[13:26:47] <freebir> slax0r, I did that, but I get aa broken content
[13:27:02] <freebir> check it out slax0r http://lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/  , click on the Clinica link to see
[13:27:04] <slax0r> then something else is broken as well
[13:27:19] <freebir> no, it's exactly the same page as the first link
[13:27:38] <freebir> I think that when I rename myModal to myModal2, I loose the css
[13:27:45] <freebir> not sure, slax0r what do you think ?
[13:27:46] <slax0r> broken content? you mean, you have too much content for that white container
[13:27:53] <slax0r> well of course you do
[13:27:59] <slax0r> if you want to apply same CSS to both
[13:28:03] <freebir> click in the home link, you will understand
[13:28:06] <slax0r> apply CSS to the class which is the same on both
[13:28:07] <slax0r> not the ID
[13:28:11] <aditsu> slax0r: that doesn't block the execution of javascript code
[13:28:32] <slax0r> aditsu, sorry, I didn't follow through what you two we're talking about :)
[13:28:45] <slax0r> all I got out was, that you want to prevent a form submit :)
[13:29:18] <freebir> slax0r, how would I do that ? I'm kinda lost man
[13:29:25] <slax0r> freebir
[13:29:33] <grafi> freebir you have the id issue with accordion and accordion-resizer also, so its probably not correctly initialized or something
[13:30:09] <slax0r> now you have your css like so: #myModal { some CSS } and maybe #myModal .some-class { some more CSS } and perhaps #myModal #anotherID { and even more CSS }
[13:30:31] <slax0r> now you need to just replace that #myModal with .class-name, of course replace .class-name with the class that is on both of those divs
[13:30:50] <aditsu> slax0r: basically, yes, but it would be easier if I could still block, otherwise I need to reorganize the code more
[13:31:47] <freebir> grafi, do you see the accordion workin fine in the home link ?? or it's messed ?
[13:31:58] <slax0r> afaik $('form selector').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); should prevent form submission
[13:32:23] <slax0r> or, you could replace forms submit button with a normal button, wire a click event on that button and submit the form within that click event function whenever you want
[13:33:04] <grafi> freebir seems fine
[13:33:15] <aditsu> slax0r: I originally had something like onclick="if(!confirm(....))return false"
[13:33:40] <slax0r> should work as well...but it's not jquery :P
[13:34:03] <skamikaze> Sensors:   System Temperatures: cpu 46.0C mobo N/A gpu 0.0:43C
[13:34:03] <skamikaze>            Fan Speeds (in rpm): cpu N/A
[13:34:07] <skamikaze> oh sry
[13:34:08] <aditsu> slax0r: right, I'm trying to replace the confirm with a nicer dialog, but then the way it works is completely different
[13:34:09] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/39/
[13:34:09] <skamikaze> misclick
[13:34:59] <BillCriswell> Damn... that's weird.
[13:35:28] <slax0r> aditsu, may I recomend apprise? it's not my plugin and I'm not connected to it in any way, it's just something I use for my sites for exaclty such purpose...
[13:35:52] <aditsu> slax0r: link?
[13:36:28] <slax0r> then, add in form a simple html input button with id, let's say form_button, then in jquery you would do something like: $("#form_button").click(function() { // apprise stuff for confirmation etc, if succes $("form selector").submit() });
[13:36:37] <slax0r> http://thrivingkings.com/read/Apprise-The-attractive-alert-alternative-for-jQuery
[13:36:38] <freebir> slax0r, how man ?
[13:36:53] <freebir> doesn't work, <a href="#" class="item"  data-reveal-id="myModal2"	data-animation="fade">A clínica</a>
[13:37:19] <slax0r> freebir it works exactly as it's supposed to
[13:37:23] <slax0r> now you need to fix your CSS
[13:37:27] <freebir> lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/css/reveal.css
[13:37:29] <slax0r> and probably accordion init
[13:38:19] <freebir> what's wrong with my css slax0r ?
[13:38:46] <freebir> I want to open many pages, now I can only open 1 page,
[13:39:38] <freebir> when I change myModal to myModal2, I loose the css , than I get a page that's all messed up, you say fix the css, ok, I know that, but what is wrong with a css that works fine for th eother link ?
[13:40:05] <aditsu> slax0r: seems to work the same way as other things I tried
[13:40:42] <slax0r> gimme a sec freebir
[13:40:44] <grafi> [22:29:26] <grafi> freebir you have the id issue with accordion and accordion-resizer also, so its probably not correctly initialized or something
[13:40:57] <slax0r> and ^this
[13:41:07] <freebir> grafi, what does that mean grafi  ?
[13:41:12] <aditsu> i.e. it doesn't block
[13:41:19] <lakridserne> Hello
[13:41:33] <grafi> that means that you have id="accordion" and id="accordion-resizer" twice
[13:41:37] <grafi> same problem as before
[13:41:44] <grafi> ids should be unique
[13:41:54] <lakridserne> I've tried implmenting some jQuery on a site but it isn't working
[13:42:01] <lakridserne> http://www.dicud.com/photo/what-songs-are-you-listening-to-this-summer/
[13:42:08] <slax0r> aditsu, true, it's not meant to block, but with the piece of code I gave you, will not try to submit the form in the first place, but you'll do it then later when apprise or any other configmation dialog says it's ok to proceed
[13:42:10] <grafi> if if do $('#myModal2').find('div').eq(2).accordion({heightStyle: "fill"}) in my js console, the second accordion works fine
[13:42:38] <lakridserne> It's supposed to take the text and put some of it in a box and then make that box expandable to contain the rest
[13:42:52] <aditsu> yeah.. there seems to be no other way, I'll try to work it out
[13:43:20] <slax0r> freebir, again, same problem, div id="accordion" multiple elements with same ID...
[13:44:00] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, it's not the full height of the page.
[13:44:04] <slax0r> aditsu, you could also use a submit button and prevent form from being submited with preventDefault, I won't put my hand over the fire for this one tho, would have to try it
[13:44:04] <freebir> slax0r,  should I change the name ? like: <div id="accordion-resizer2" class="ui-widget-content"><div id="accordion2">
[13:44:10] <freebir> ?? what should I do ?
[13:44:15] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, I want them both to be the full height basically.
[13:44:43] <slax0r> uhm...I'd use classes instead of IDs...trust me
[13:44:45] <slax0r> anyhoo
[13:44:46] <aditsu> slax0r: isn't that the same thing?
[13:45:24] <slax0r> well yeah, basically it is, you know, there are more ways to skin a cat
[13:45:33] <slax0r> anyhoo, the second, g2g, byez
[13:45:40] <fonko> guys is there any jquery countdown that actually does conunt backwards ? because the ones that i saw they all resent their countdown each time you refresh the page
[13:45:42] <Silluron> \join #javascript
[13:45:48] <Silluron> whooops
[13:45:56] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: in your fiddle it's the full height of <body> , the container
[13:45:57] <fonko> Silluron, lol
[13:47:34] <fonko> guys is there any jquery countdown that actually does conunt backwards ? because the ones that i saw they all resent their countdown each time you refresh the page
[13:47:38] <freebir> slax0r, how ??
[13:47:39] <freebir> where ??
[13:48:24] <grafi> just make everything with id="accordion" into class="accordion" and then instead of $('#accordion') you do $('.accordion')
[13:48:46] <grafi> and that should make it work for as many accordions as you can ever dream of having
[13:49:21] <freebir> grafi, <div id="accordion-resizer2" class="ui-widget-content"><div id="accordion2">
[13:49:28] <freebir> what do I do with the actual class ???
[13:49:39] <grafi> keep it
[13:49:41] <grafi> ...
[13:49:43] <freebir> if I change the id to class, there will be 2 classes, that's wrong
[13:49:54] <grafi> you cant really be asking this can you ...
[13:50:05] <grafi> class="accordion ui-widget-bleh"
[13:50:06] <grafi> tada
[13:50:35] <freebir>  <div class="accordion-resizer ui-widget-content"><div class="accordion2">
[13:50:38] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: couldn't get it right without !important  http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/41/
[13:50:40] <freebir> grafi, ?? that's it ?
[13:50:57] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, I got it it to work.
[13:50:58] <grafi> well the class should probably be accordion
[13:51:06] <freebir> <div class="accordion-resizer ui-widget-content"><div class="accordion">  or should I use the number 2 in the end ?
[13:51:19] <Criztian> hello ppl, I just created an infinite scroller, it works on all browsers except on firefox. The issue is not calling $(windows).scroll() when the content is not larger than the height.
[13:51:21] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: like i did or another way?
[13:51:33] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, one moment I'll past the minimal code.
[13:52:05] <grafi> fonko what plugins did you look at that worked like that oÃ´
[13:53:06] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, http://pastebin.com/bFcnXSXm
[13:53:49] <Sirisian|Work> the extra div seemed to be the main idea. Odd
[13:54:07] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: that's not an extra div
[13:54:27] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, (the refresh isn't needed)
[13:54:29] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: you were making the accordion's content-container div into an accordion itself
[13:54:36] <Sirisian|Work> ah
[13:54:48] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: it's needed in some cases, depending on the window size
[13:55:04] <shoky> or on the container size, rather
[13:56:26] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: also.. height:1000px isn't really full height
[13:56:32] <freebir> grafi, slax0r did all the changes, but still doesn't work, I'm almost there, http://lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/
[13:56:40] <freebir> 2'nd link is broken]
[13:57:13] <grafi> i dont see the changes
[13:57:47] <grafi> its still id on both
[13:57:59] <freebir> weird, wait
[13:58:05] <grafi> for the second modal
[13:59:08] <lakridserne> Could anyone here help me implement some simple jQuery? I have the code I just can't figure out why it's not working
[14:03:59] <freebir> grafi, slax0r sorry friends, now I uploaded the right way
[14:04:00] <freebir> but still no success,
[14:04:02] <freebir> I feel we are almost thare
[14:04:03] <freebir> there
[14:05:24] <grafi> i still see id on the second modal, no change :P
[14:05:56] <grafi> the container btw has also an id of container both times, you seem to do that a lot
[14:05:58] <maxmoore14> anybody have issues with file downloads on chrome mobile?
[14:06:23] <freebir> grafi, sorry, changes
[14:06:33] <freebir> changed
[14:06:58] <garbagegod> Can anyone recommend me a responsive jquery slider with a good API? Every slider I've seen appears to be made by someone who learned javascript a week prior
[14:07:03] <maxmoore14> pretty simple situation: window.location.href = 'https://domain.com/filename.jpg';
[14:07:08] <garbagegod> I'm fond of RoyalSlider, fwiw
[14:07:09] <grafi> and its working freebir
[14:07:10] <freebir> grafi, worked man
[14:07:15] <freebir> grafi, tksss dudeee
[14:07:19] <maxmoore14> it works in every desktop browser I've tried
[14:07:26] <freebir> tks you guys,

[14:08:48] <maxmoore14> anybody know about a known issue with chrome mobile?
[14:09:00] <maxmoore14> or is it potentially specific to my device?
[14:09:35] <maxmoore14> if someone has an android and is willing to help me test, I'll throw up some sample code
[14:12:34] <lakridserne> maxmoore14: sure

[14:13:23] <aFtAb> Hello, is it possible with jquery to add text to clipboard on click please ?
[14:17:05] <spikku> I'm having this strange issue where "$.cookie is not a function" if a user is not logged in. The same JS is being included in both versions of the page. I see no JS errors, and all files are loading 200 OK. ???
[14:20:46] <Criztian> Anyway, solved everything on my own
[14:22:15] <garbagegod> anyone on a slider?
[14:23:22] <garbagegod> nobody I guess
[14:28:16] <Toerkeium> guys, I have a list of <input>s with an specific ID. The ID of this inputs is made of a string "gs" + "the id of another field" + "a string". I want to make with one click, fill up a form with all inputs which share the same "string", this is the list of inputs: http://www.pastebin.ca/2410159
[14:28:48] <Toerkeium> it would be $('#lat').val($('#gslat' + getid).val());
[14:29:03] <Toerkeium> for every input, I'm sure it's possible to make it easier
[14:42:01] <zulu-gula> I get error when trying to use jquery.dataTables.columnFilter.js
[14:51:49] <boo> Hi! If I add my plugin using <script>$('#myDiv').myPlugin(vars);</script> how can I get the #myDiv from the inside of the plugin, if I have a click event on a child of this div?
[14:56:29] <Skullclown> boo: on .click() of child; $(this).parent()
[14:57:27] <lakridserne> I've tried but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong when implementing http://shakenandstirredweb.com/240/jquery-moreless-text into http://www.dicud.com/photo/what-songs-are-you-listening-to-this-summer/
[14:58:37] <boo> Skullclown, what I'm trying to do is to replace $('#dateContainer'). with a variable which is the main $this, as the plugin is being called by $('#dateContainer').myplugin... http://pastebin.com/JHga9P2j
[14:59:11] <boo> Skullclown, is there another way besides the parent()? Just somehow storing $this?
[14:59:15] <Skullclown> boo: $this does not exist, try understanding your issue and formulate a correct quetion
[14:59:41] <Skullclown> question *
[15:00:31] <boo> Skullclown, Well I ment $(this) or a local variable.. I just want to replace the static $('#dateContainer'). with a variable inside my plugin..
[15:01:16] <Toerkeium> nobody?
[15:01:37] <Skullclown> boo: what's wrong with $(this).parent() ?
[15:02:14] <Skullclown> Toerkeium: ask your question again
[15:02:37] <Toerkeium> Skullclown:  I have a list of <input>s with an specific ID. The ID of this inputs is made of a string "gs" + "the id of another field" + "a string". I want to make with one click, fill up a form with all inputs which share the same "string", this is the list of inputs: http://www.pastebin.ca/2410159
[15:02:45] <Toerkeium> it would be $('#lat').val($('#gslat' + getid).val());
[15:02:48] <Toerkeium> for every input, I'm sure it's possible to make it easier
[15:03:03] <boo> Skullclown, I just want to know if there's another way by somehow storing the variable.. What I was trying to do is to add var mainElement = $(this); after     $(document).ready( function() { but clearly, that wasn't right
[15:03:54] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: can you create a simplified version at jsfiddle?
[15:04:17] <Skullclown> eddiemonge: he linked the list of inputs :)
[15:04:45] <eddiemonge> Skullclown: did you look at that list? theres also no js there with the op attempts so far
[15:04:55] <Toerkeium> Skullclown:  I have it here, testing: http://liquidaciones.dnsba.com/testing.php
[15:04:57] <Skullclown> Toerkeium: do you want to be able to select a specific object that has that string in its ID?
[15:05:07] <Skullclown> eddiemonge: I did
[15:06:28] <Toerkeium> I tried $('button[id^="but"]').click( function() { alert($('input[id*="6dea789438bd55599cac9014d83a968fb87ff24f"]').val());  }); but it only shows the first input
[15:06:39] <Toerkeium> I got that far with the docs
[15:06:53] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: what are you trying to do with all these inputs again? can you rephrase your question?
[15:07:09] <Skullclown> Toerkeium: use .each() instead of .val()
[15:07:13] <Toerkeium> let me try, I'm not with english eddiemonge
[15:08:17] <Skullclown> Toerkeium: .val() only returns the value of the first element
[15:09:00] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, I just figured out why I wasn't able to reproduce it. Here this reproduces the bug: http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/42/ I just moved the inner accordion to the second div.
[15:09:06] <Toerkeium> I see Skullclown
[15:09:07] <Skullclown> boo: it is possible. but since we don't know or have your code, we can't tell you where to put it. $(this).parent() should work fine though, so I'm unsure why you don't want to use it
[15:09:52] <Toerkeium> it shows a function now, I think I should do now a function to parse all elelements
[15:10:08] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: I'm trying to fill up a form with all inputs which share the same "string"
[15:10:10] <Skullclown> Toerkeium: yes.
[15:10:34] <Toerkeium> but not every $(id).val($(id).val()); for every input
[15:10:36] <Skullclown> .each(function() { console.log($(this).val()); });
[15:10:47] <freebir> grafi, still there pall ?
[15:10:52] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: fill it how? with what data?
[15:10:53] <Toerkeium> great!! thanks Skullclown!
[15:10:54] <grafi> sure
[15:11:02] <Toerkeium> eddiemonge: with the value of each input
[15:11:12] <boo> Skullclown, I have provided a link above to the code, and I have also explained why I want to find another way - just to learn another way.
[15:11:22] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: you mean you want to submit the form?
[15:11:37] <Skullclown> eddiemonge: basically he has a bunch of inputs that contain the same unique string in their ID. he wants to get the inputs that contain that specific string and get their values.
[15:11:53] <Skullclown> what he actually does with the values is irrelevant, that's not what he needs to know
[15:11:53] <freebir> grafi, everytime I want to load the website, it loads all the pages, and all the images, is there a way I only load that accordion div, with the tabs, texts and pics only when the link is called ?
[15:12:43] <Toerkeium> not submit, just loop into the inputs which share the same string inside the id of them and lets say "do something with it, but I think skullclown finished the issue :)
[15:12:44] <Skullclown> boo: your link gives me "Unknown Paste ID!"
[15:13:50] <freebir> grafi, so it would load the home, and the slide, but not the other 'pages'( divs ), they only get loaded when I choose to open them
[15:14:00] <grafi> not if its all on the same page
[15:14:18] <Skullclown> AJAX
[15:15:00] <boo> Skullclown, because the paste has expired, as I pasted it more than 10 minutes ago. Here's a new one - http://pastebin.com/BBnFHM7Z
[15:15:50] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: var vals = $('input[id*="17b7b2ca885f956e6efceb3fa0c4af1c9e8d8023"]').map(function () { return this.value; }).get().join();
[15:17:02] <Toerkeium> Skullclown : got it working with $('input[id*="6dea789438bd55599cac9014d83a968fb87ff24f"]').each(function() { console.log($(this).val()); }); anyway I'll see what you did to learn, thanks alot both if you!
[15:17:38] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: what i pasted is what you want. use the .map() function
[15:17:47] <Skullclown> Toerkeium: I also recommend trying eddiemonge's method :)
[15:18:29] <eddiemonge> boo: have you console.log'ed $(this) on line 6? versus just console.log(this) ?
[15:18:37] <Toerkeium> let me see it, I understand more the Skullclown approach, but having both suggesting the eddiemonge approach I'll read about it and learn
[15:19:05] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[15:19:38] <boo> eddiemonge, no I have not, I have tryed to debug step by step using firebug tough..
[15:19:41] <Toerkeium> thanks eddiemonge
[15:21:20] <Sirisian|Work> Anyone ever try to nest accordion ui elements? http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/44/ Simple code, yet they seem to overflow on the second and third accordion item.
[15:21:32] <Toerkeium> ahh I see, very nice
[15:21:55] <eddiemonge> boo: whats your question?
[15:21:58] <freebir> I'm using includes to each one, grafi
[15:22:43] <freebir> isn't there a way I can ignore pieces of the code on each reload ?
[15:22:52] <freebir> grafi,
[15:23:24] <freebir> each page is included in the main page like this: 		<?php	echo $this->element('clinica');		?>
[15:23:27] <freebir> grafi,
[15:23:38] <freebir> than home, link3, link4
[15:23:43] <grafi> i dont think you can load just fragments ... you would have to save different parts and then load them via ajax as Skullclown suggested
[15:23:46] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: you need to change heightStyle to content
[15:23:50] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: do you still need help with that?
[15:24:02] <maxmoore14> lakridserne: thanks for the offer to help, but I've narrowed the issue down to a known problem with Chrome for Android
[15:24:05] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, I'll test what eddiemonge said.
[15:24:30] <boo> eddiemonge, line 25, I want to replace $('#dateContainer'). with a variable, which is the main $(this) (I have problems with explaining this). I'm calling the plugin by <script>$('#dateContainer').myplugin(vars)</script> and I want the 25th line to just use an variable which would be set automatically
[15:24:45] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, that doesn't work. I need it to fill the whole page.
[15:25:01] <freebir> grafi, Skullclown I could just find out which page I'm asking for, and depending that with JS, comment parts of the code automatically, what do you guys think ?
[15:25:17] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, yeah http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/44/ notice that the second and third items have the inner accordion overflow.
[15:25:47] <grafi> if you comment it out its still being loaded ...
[15:25:48] <grafi> oÃ´
[15:25:57] <Toerkeium> I'm tempted to ask you how to get ride of the "gs" text and the id, but I think it's just being lazy :P
[15:26:13] <freebir> I see
[15:26:25] <freebir> Skullclown, what should I look for man ?
[15:26:29] <freebir> grafi, tks again
[15:27:04] <freebir> grafi, didn't know that iti would download images and texts of comemnted areas, that's new to me
[15:27:11] <Skullclown> freebir: commenting is not a real idea
[15:27:16] <grafi> hm images probably not
[15:27:22] <grafi> idk for sure though
[15:27:31] <Skullclown> I would say $.ajax(...) is the only decent alternative
[15:27:31] <eddiemonge> boo: no idea what you are doing but this code might be slightly better: http://pastebin.com/qTDbxp7A
[15:27:51] <freebir> I see,
[15:27:53] <grafi> but if you want to do it, do it right :P
[15:28:01] <freebir> grafi, yeah
[15:28:16] <freebir> tks, I'll read about it
[15:28:17] <freebir> tks
[15:28:21] <Skullclown> freebir: there's no real reason not to use ajax
[15:28:25] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: im only seeing that overflow because the window height isnt tall enough to show the whole inner accordian
[15:28:38] <freebir> Skullclown, it would be true if I knew ajax, lol
[15:28:42] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, the inner accordion has no defined height?
[15:28:45] <freebir> the problem is I don't, lool
[15:29:18] <Skullclown> freebir: it's easy
[15:29:29] <freebir> Skullclown, i see
[15:30:10] <boo> eddiemonge, yeah, I'm just toooo tired to work on this tonight. Thanks for helpong!
[15:30:11] <Skullclown> freebir: .load() works too if you want to place HTML in a specific element
[15:30:30] <Skullclown> e.g.: $('#foo').load('bar.html');
[15:30:35] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: this seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/VYbSU/45/
[15:30:36] <eddiemonge> boo: http://pastebin.com/rp1xf7mm
[15:30:46] <freebir> Skullclown, nice, I'll check for that,
[15:30:54] <Skullclown> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:32:00] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, :| Good think I asked you. I don't think I would have found that.
[15:32:44] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, Does this seem like a bug in jquery?
[15:32:49] <Sirisian|Work> well jquery ui
[15:33:08] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: i dunno
[15:34:05] <boo> eddiemonge, thanks!
[15:34:09] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: the docs don't say that heightStyle:'fill' will pick up on container resize
[15:34:40] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: and doing a refresh on them makes them pick up on it.. so doesn't seem like a bug. but maybe ;S
[15:35:40] <fiyarburst> i'm having a weird issue, i have a form in a bootstrap popover and a submit handler
[15:36:16] <fiyarburst> the submit handler is getting lost, i have a hunch that it's getting lost because the popover changes where the form is in the DOM
[15:36:37] <Toerkeium> guys, how can I get the string 17b7b2ca885f956e6efceb3fa0c4af1c9e8d8023 within the function $('input[id*="17b7b2ca885f956e6efceb3fa0c4af1c9e8d8023"]').map(function (x,y) { });
[15:38:30] <_rgn> in the worst case, use $(this).attr('id').match(YOUR_REGEX)
[15:38:33] <shoky> Toerkeium: "17b7b2ca885f956e6efceb3fa0c4af1c9e8d8023"
[15:38:41] <shoky> this.id plz
[15:38:58] <_rgn> thx
[15:39:49] <Toerkeium> $this.id to me shoky?
[15:39:56] <Toerkeium> I tried and I get undefined
[15:40:07] <shoky> Toerkeium: i didn't say $this.id
[15:40:19] <shoky> and i said it mostly to _rgn anyways
[15:40:28] <Toerkeium> oh, sorry
[15:40:39] <shoky> though he was saying something to you, i believe
[15:41:24] <fiyarburst> http://jsfiddle.net/8AV8C/2/ there's the DOM/submit issue
[15:41:28] <Toerkeium> oh sorry, I didn't see _rgn response
[15:42:19] <Toerkeium> _rgn; I see, I'll use some delimiter then so I can easily use regex
[15:42:20] <Toerkeium> thanks!
[15:42:44] <user_corrupt> Im trying to use this script for a floating sidebar: http://jsfiddle.net/K3XL8/ on a div class "vsrc_widget" in my sidebar here: http://www.libertycrusaders.com/ I dont understand why, but the ".offset" value for that div doesnt change when I am scrolling the page up and down, so I guess that has everything to do with why the script is failing
[15:42:47] <shoky> if you have the string outside the function, why don't you have it inside
[15:43:08] <_rgn> that hard coded id you have is a bit weird, to give you a better answer need to have a better understanding of the problem
[15:43:21] <Toerkeium> shoky: beacuse it's like that now for testing, but I won't have it there, it will be just passed by another function
[15:43:27] <shoky> Toerkeium: so?
[15:43:39] <shoky> if you manage to build a selector like that with it.. it means you have it, no?
[15:44:11] <shoky> in a variable, i mean
[15:44:28] <Toerkeium> shoky: yes I'll have it. How can I pass it to the function?
[15:44:36] <eddiemonge> Toerkeium: it might be easier to add a data-group-id="yourrandomstring" to each element
[15:44:37] <shoky> you don't need to pass it
[15:44:58] <Toerkeium> arggg.. you're right, I just can use the variable
[15:45:09] <Toerkeium> sorry, I got my head burn with all this
[15:45:12] <shoky> that's what i meant with <shoky> Toerkeium: "17b7b2ca885f956e6efceb3fa0c4af1c9e8d8023"
[15:45:13] <shoky> :P
[15:46:23] <Toerkeium> what's that data-group-id eddiemonge?
[15:47:56] <eddiemonge> <input id="youruniqueid" data-group-id="random_string" />  $('[data-group-id="random_string"]').map(function() { return this.value; //or this.data('group-id') })
[15:48:33] <Toerkeium> uff.. excellent
[15:48:40] <Toerkeium> thank you
[15:49:25] <DarkGhost`> hello everyone, I was wondering lets say I have a <div> than <img class='selector'> if I'm in $('.selector') for some reason .prev() doesn't get the div?
[15:49:56] <_rgn> DarkGhost`: do you want the parent or prev sibling?
[15:50:01] <DarkGhost`> parent
[15:50:09] <_rgn> well, ^
[15:50:31] <DarkGhost`> whats previous sibling?
[15:50:45] <Skullclown> anyone ever used Intel's App Framework?
[15:50:49] <shoky> <div>...</div> <img class="selector">
[15:51:01] <DarkGhost`> gotcha thats previous sibling
[15:51:03] <DarkGhost`> okay thank you
[15:51:35] <eddiemonge> DarkGhost`: maybe you should do http://try.jquery.com/
[16:03:56] <DarkGhost`> 			var parentdiv = $(this).parent().parent();					$('.photo .curdefault').prependTo(parentdiv); how do I make this work properly?
[16:05:22] <ylandsman> Can anyone tell me if there is a way to configure ajaxSubmit to accept multiple responses from the server?
[16:06:14] <Skullclown> ylandsman: HTTP isn't meant to send multiple responses?
[16:06:17] <ylandsman> What I am trying to do is to upload and file and then perform some processing on it, and I want to have a status update show on the parent frame
[16:06:22] <Eviltwin> DarkGhost`: Depends on what you're trying to accomplish
[16:06:33] <fiyarburst> so does anyone know if submit/other binds are supposed to be lost on DOM changes or if that's unexpected behavior/an error in my code?
[16:06:56] <eddiemonge> ylandsman: sounds like what you want is a websocket connection
[16:06:56] <DarkGhost`> trying to .prepend .curdefault to the $(this).parent().paren() div, i did .prependTo('#soliddiv') and it works but for some reason the parentdiv isn't
[16:07:18] <InphraRed> does anyone remember that site a long time ago written in DHTML that emulated WindowMaker?
[16:07:51] <eddiemonge> fiyarburst: if you remove an element that has something bound to it, it should remove it
[16:08:01] <eddiemonge> what is WindowMaker?
[16:08:06] <ylandsman> Skullclown: I understand that, but I can't think of any other way to provide an ongoing status for a long running process
[16:08:11] <Eviltwin> fiyarburst: You may want to look at the difference between .remove() and .detach()
[16:08:12] <InphraRed> I was wondering if there were any way to emulate MOTIF within the browser.
[16:08:27] <eddiemonge> ylandsman: sounds like what you want is a websocket connection
[16:08:32] <InphraRed> eddimonge WindowMaker is a famous desktop environment usually on Linux.
[16:08:51] <ylandsman> eddiemonge: can you point me in a direction for implementing that
[16:09:00] <InphraRed> eddiemonge www.windowmaker.org
[16:09:13] <eddiemonge> InphraRed: are you talking about http://www.jolicloud.com/ ?
[16:09:20] <eddiemonge> ylandsman: socket.io
[16:09:42] <ylandsman> eddimonge: thank you
[16:09:51] <InphraRed> eddiemonge no, that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about
[16:10:04] <DarkGhost`> hmm that should work..
[16:10:29] <DarkGhost`> figured it out, thanks.
[16:11:07] <InphraRed> in the days of DHTML, one of the things that would demonstrate how awesome your coding skills were was to use javascript and HTML hacks to basically emulate desktop environments.  There used to be a lot of webpages that would emulate Windows 98, CDE, even command line interfaces like UNIX.
[16:11:31] <InphraRed> then jquery came along... and it's no longer called "DHTML"
[16:12:36] <InphraRed> such things are still heavily useful, because you could make web-based training demonstrations without people having to actually install an application, but you could emulate the UI but not the functionality of a program or environment.
[16:13:06] <ylandsman> eddimonge: can I use socket.io in conjunction with php?
[16:13:18] <InphraRed> this is how you blur an image in Photoshop, emulate the entire look and feel of Photoshop so the person can click around all the menus and everything.
[16:13:27] <Eviltwin> ylandsman: I don't think so
[16:14:13] <ylandsman> eviltwin: is there anything else I could use that would work with php (and in particular zend framework)
[16:14:19] <InphraRed> so my question was if there were any projects like 'jquery' still around but focused on themes, look and feels, skins with which you could make portions of your site look and act like any UI
[16:14:31] <InphraRed> in particular MOTIF
[16:15:09] <Eviltwin> ylandsman: I think I did something like this way back when
[16:15:14] <Eviltwin> But it required two connections
[16:15:25] <Eviltwin> One was uploading the file and another was reporting status updates on the upload
[16:15:49] <ylandsman> eviltwin: did you just write your own socket code?
[16:16:07] <Eviltwin> "socket code" is not congruent with PHP
[16:33:36] <Forbidd3n> What can I use instead of .on since the jquery version is earlier than that
[16:33:47] <Forbidd3n> I need to to work when items are added to the dom
[16:35:52] <_rgn> Forbidd3n: afaik there's no such thing in jquery
[16:35:56] <_rgn> i've used dom mutation observer for that
[16:36:04] <tw2113> live() probably
[16:37:36] <_rgn> yeah you can use live() for binding events on current and future selectors
[16:37:43] <_rgn> if that's what Forbidd3n meant
[16:37:59] <tw2113> i took it as him/her needing pre-on methods
[16:39:06] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: Predating .on is .bind and .delegate
[16:39:32] <Eviltwin> .on now performs the function of .bind and .delegate which do somewhat different things
[16:39:40] <Eviltwin> So look at the pages for both of them before moving forward
[16:40:02] <tw2113> or you could always upgrade the version of jQuery you're using
[16:40:08] <Eviltwin> Usually, not always
[16:58:04] <NaN> I have ajaxSuccess asigned to document, so if I do any ajax on the document the data goes through ajaxSuccess, now, how can I "stop" the success event of the ajax from ajaxSuccess?
[16:58:04] <Forbidd3n> I keep getting $(...).dialog is not a function even though I am including the ui and jquery but it might be conflicting with jquery tools
[16:59:05] <eddiemonge> it is
[17:01:01] <Eviltwin> NaN: I don't think you can
[17:01:05] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to?
[17:02:18] <NaN> Eviltwin: I load json snippets from REST (with ajax) but if the user is logued out the response from the server is {response:logout}
[17:02:27] <Forbidd3n> ?
[17:03:41] <NaN> Eviltwin: right now I have if's on every ajax call to check that, but I would like to use a global check instead repeat code every ajax call I do.
[17:05:02] <eddiemonge> NaN: your server should be sending 403's that your ajax error function would handl
[17:05:13] <eddiemonge> or is it 401? i always forget
[17:05:42] <eddiemonge> 401
[17:06:17] <NaN> eddiemonge: nice! I like that, is there a way to catch that response? that way I can still do something if the response is 401
[17:07:08] <eddiemonge> yeah, that will land in the ajax error
[17:08:10] <NaN> nice
[17:10:13] <Forbidd3n> anyone know why I am getting $(...).dialog is not a function even though I am including ui and jquery
[17:17:34] <Forbidd3n> anyone
[17:19:19] <hugo_moss> forbidd3n you have a jsfiddle so i can take look
[17:19:44] <aditsu> hmm so how can I trigger submit on a form with a specific button?
[17:19:57] <Eviltwin> aditsu: Trigger a click on the button
[17:20:32] <aditsu> Eviltwin: that would be nice, but I'm doing a confirmation dialog on the button so it doesn't submit by default, I want to submit on "ok"
[17:20:44] <aditsu> Eviltwin: I guess click would fire the dialog again
[17:21:58] <aditsu> and.. it does
[17:22:48] <aditsu> slax0r: any ideas about the above?
[17:23:05] <Eviltwin> aditsu: I'm making you a demo of how to fix it right now
[17:23:33] <aditsu> oh cool :)
[17:25:01] <Guest55953> Hi people , i have a question , i wanna make a menu with a selector image that would slide through the buttons(links) smoothly with a mouse movement around navigation area.

[17:26:28] <aditsu> Eviltwin: hmm interesting
[17:28:11] <aditsu> kinda convoluted, but does the job
[17:28:18] <Guest55953> baaaaaah help me out peepz T_T

[17:29:50] <Eviltwin> Guest55953: Can you show a site that has this thing?
[17:29:55] <Eviltwin> Can you use pictures or something?
[17:30:16] <aditsu> Eviltwin: yes that's the gist of it; I guess it's not too bad, thanks!

[17:45:53] <Forbidd3n> anyone on why the jquery modal isn't working please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmz7v/2/
[17:47:37] <nights> Eviltwin: i dont know if i can create a live demo, its all server side generated
[17:48:05] <nights> but is there a general problem that calling a $.ajax will cause some kind of flicker?
[17:48:06] <Eviltwin> nights: Then use view source in your browser
[17:48:06] <Forbidd3n> the issue is it prelaods showing the modal
[17:48:41] <nights> ah...
[17:48:44] <nights> i think i know why now
[17:49:26] <nights> .ajaxStart(function() { ...
[17:49:32] <nights> that function is evil
[17:49:34] <nights> write that somewhere
[17:50:33] <Eviltwin> Nubcake: http://jsfiddle.net/sjWa7/
[17:51:13] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/jmz7v/3/
[17:51:57] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: Or http://jsfiddle.net/jmz7v/4/
[17:52:05] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: You're constructing it and telling it not to open
[17:52:07] <Eviltwin> That's your problem
[17:52:48] <Nubcake> Eviltwin: yay thanks man , now it will be easy to do what i want :D ur the best
[17:52:55] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: The best way to do it is: http://jsfiddle.net/jmz7v/5/
[17:53:04] <Eviltwin> Nubcake: No problem, good luck, man.
[17:54:09] <Nubcake> Eviltwin: oh another thigh , is it possible to make the hover get back to the top when im not hovering ?
[17:54:58] <Forbidd3n> Eviltwin: thanks. Do you know why I would get $(...).dialog is not a function even though I am including jquery and ui, maybe jquery tools might be conflicting?
[17:55:12] <Forbidd3n> Eviltwin: thanks btw
[17:55:35] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: Are you also including other libraries?
[17:56:01] <Forbidd3n> jquery tools
[17:56:04] <Forbidd3n> that is really it
[17:56:40] <Eviltwin> Nubcake: http://jsfiddle.net/sjWa7/1/
[17:57:02] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: Try including jQuery tools in this Fiddle and see if it breaks
[17:57:15] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: Or try removing them from your site (temporarily) and see if it starts working
[17:57:49] <Nubcake> Eviltwin: thanks :P :)
[17:58:12] <Eviltwin> Nubcake: And the way I wrote it you can have as many of these menus on your page at a time as you want
[18:00:01] <skypce> hello all
[18:00:07] <Nubcake> Eviltwin: ya i see that u wrote it well and pretty simple , won't be any overloads and everything is easy to understand , will have a VERY comfortable work time while working on the navigation :P
[18:00:41] <skypce> i have a problem with this code http://jsfiddle.net/JtusA/  , i need that apply a .class when scrollY is in some #regions
[18:01:46] <Forbidd3n> Eviltwin: it is conflicting with toosl
[18:01:47] <Forbidd3n> tools
[18:01:55] <Forbidd3n> it is because tools is using the $
[18:02:12] <Forbidd3n> if I use no conflict with jQuery( instead of $( should be fine, correct?
[18:02:20] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ Forbidd3n
[18:02:20] <b-ot> Forbidd3n: Try It And See
[18:02:20] <bot-t> Forbidd3n, Try It And See
[18:04:30] <aditsu> 2 bots? :o
[18:04:47] <skypce> do you know some scroll jquery plugin that allow me add a class when position visible is bottom or centeR?
[18:05:44] <aditsu> Eviltwin: so the click thing works well, thanks for the help
[18:06:00] <Eviltwin> aditsu: Great!
[18:06:04] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[18:07:31] <Forbidd3n> anyway to use create a different alias with jquery no conflict
[18:07:41] <Forbidd3n> instead of jQuery something linke jDialog
[18:08:11] <aditsu> skypce: you can use scroll() to add a handler, and scrollTop() to get the scroll position
[18:08:17] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: Read "Aliasing the jQuery Namespace" here: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[18:09:09] <skypce> aditsu: i am searching for a plugin , for future works
[18:09:24] <skypce> a easy use plugin
[18:09:42] <aditsu> well, keep searching then :p
[18:14:38] <luvmyh0nda> Hi! I have two issues with regards to jQuery UI tabs: 1) Whenever dynamically controlling tabs, my index 0 tab becomes unavailable. 2) I would like to make a blank tab, which always sits at the right side (eg, index 9999999) - is this possible?
[18:15:49] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ luvmyh0nda
[18:15:50] <bot-t> luvmyh0nda, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[18:16:21] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[18:16:26] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ luvmyh0nda
[18:16:26] <bot-t> luvmyh0nda, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[18:16:28] <Eviltwin> Forgot my acronyms
[18:17:54] <luvmyh0nda> ok, so that's #1, how do I resolve #2?
[18:18:19] <Eviltwin> I don't understand #2 can you try to explain with pictures or something?
[18:18:40] <skypce> guys a little question
[18:18:56] <skypce> dont make me do a  fiddle for it please it is a short code
[18:18:58] <skypce> if (y >= z1 || y>=z2 || y>=z3)
[18:19:05] <skypce> what is wrong with this code?
[18:19:09] <Eviltwin> ...
[18:19:51] <Eviltwin> skypce: The code you have just sent us is syntactically correct (if you put a block or statement after it) so there's actually nothing wrong with it
[18:20:07] <Eviltwin> skypce: What you mean is "why isn't this code doing what I want it to do?"
[18:20:09] <skypce> :S only works the first element
[18:20:16] <Eviltwin> And I don't know because I don't know what you want it to do
[18:20:31] <skypce> ok i will make a fiddle :D
[18:20:40] <luvmyh0nda> Eviltwin: for example, in a tabbed browser (ie, chrome, firefox, etc) you can add a new tab by clicking the blank small tab which is on the far right of all other tabs
[18:20:44] <Eviltwin> skypce: Thank you
[18:21:26] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/JtusA/1/
[18:22:25] <skypce> i need that when i use mouse scroll in three divs add a class and remove a class after scroll will be not visible
[18:22:26] <skypce> mm
[18:22:31] <skypce> i go to smoke
[18:22:32] <skypce> :S
[18:23:39] <Eviltwin> luvmyh0nda: http://jsfiddle.net/9EhBq/
[18:24:24] <Eviltwin> skypce: What this code does is add the animated and lightSpeedIn classes after you've scrolled to the top of any of these three
[18:24:36] <Eviltwin> If you're past the top of any of them the class will remain
[18:24:51] <Eviltwin> Only once you go above all of them will it stop
[18:25:13] <Eviltwin> skypce: Please add some HTML that helps demonstrate your issue and try again
[18:25:21] <Eviltwin> That's the "working" in "live working demo of your problem"
[18:26:04] <Eviltwin> luvmyh0nda: Or simply: http://jsfiddle.net/9EhBq/1/
[18:27:30] <luvmyh0nda> is there a way to do it dynamically?
[18:27:52] <Eviltwin> Yes, you .css("float", "right") on the tab
[18:28:53] <skypce> Eviltwin:  wait me i will add html
[18:29:16] <Eviltwin> skypce: Sorry, I'm leaving in just a few minutes. Maybe someone else can help
[18:30:58] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/JtusA/2/
[18:31:11] <Eviltwin> That was completely useless dude
[18:31:17] <Eviltwin> You see how the bottom right panel is empty
[18:31:32] <Eviltwin> That means I can't actually see your code in action
[18:31:43] <Eviltwin> The point of a demo is that you demonstrate the problem
[18:31:53] <Eviltwin> This isn't a demonstration, this is just a dump of code
[18:32:06] <skypce> :S
[18:32:08] <luvmyh0nda> Eviltwin: didn't quite display the desired result, i have a screenshot though
[18:33:01] <luvmyh0nda> http://imgur.com/G13wjsu
[18:33:19] <Eviltwin> luvmyh0nda: Then you didn't put the float: right on the right thing
[18:33:54] <luvmyh0nda> Eviltwin: the way in the screenshot shows the desired result. when clicking the "+", it should insert a tab just before the "+", and select that tab
[18:34:12] <luvmyh0nda> i don't want the "+" to be on the far right of the menu, i want it to be to the right of the last child
[18:34:19] <luvmyh0nda> (and/or menu tab)
[18:34:32] <Eviltwin> Then just make it the last tab
[18:34:37] <Eviltwin> How hard is that?
[18:35:36] <luvmyh0nda> Nothing is hard in programming, it's just knowing where to go to find how to get your desired result, for which I have looked, but was unable to locate a method for assigning a 'last' tab
[18:35:57] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[18:36:02] <Eviltwin> In HTML the elements fall in a particular order
[18:36:09] <Eviltwin> You just put the one that you want last after tall the other ones
[18:36:33] <luvmyh0nda> yes, but once i add a new tab programatically, does it not become the second to last tab?
[18:36:40] <luvmyh0nda> my tabs are not static
[18:36:46] <skypce> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/JtusA/8/
[18:36:50] <skypce> now works :S
[18:37:11] <luvmyh0nda> think browser within a browser. For example, in firefox, you're looking at a new page, click the (last) add new tab button, a new tab comes up
[18:37:22] <luvmyh0nda> which is the second to last tab, last tab still being add new tab
[18:37:33] <Eviltwin> luvmyh0nda: Depends on how you're ading the new tabs
[18:37:37] <Eviltwin> How are you adding the new tabs
[18:37:41] <Eviltwin> You still haven't given me that code I asked for

[18:40:07] <fiyarburst> Eviltwin: about looking into the difference between remove and detach
[18:40:35] <fiyarburst> the issue is that i'm using twitter bootstrap, and it looks like the popover function i'm using is removing
[18:41:22] <luvmyh0nda> hmm, causes problems

[18:42:56] <skypce> very Thank you Eviltwin
[18:43:02] <skypce> it is that i am searching
[18:43:03] <fiyarburst> http://jsfiddle.net/8AV8C/2/
[18:43:07] <skypce> a little question
[18:43:17] <skypce> how can i search for fiddles in google?
[18:43:37] <Eviltwin> Well since they typically don't self-describe, you can't really.
[18:43:41] <Eviltwin> I built that for you, I didn't find it
[18:43:55] <skypce> awesome
[18:43:59] <skypce> :D
[18:44:06] <skypce> thank you Eviltwin
[18:44:12] <Eviltwin> fiyarburst: So what's supposed to happen here that's not
[18:44:24] <luvmyh0nda> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/zRdnb/1/
[18:44:29] <luvmyh0nda> xss is preventing it
[18:44:39] <fiyarburst> Eviltwin: when you click give feedback, it displays the popover with the input field
[18:44:47] <fiyarburst> when you click submit, the alert isn't showing up
[18:45:17] <fiyarburst> so what's happening is because bootstrap's popover moves the div out to a different place in the DOM, the submit handler's being lost
[18:47:08] <fiyarburst> (at least, that's what i'm assuming is happening, i can't think of any other reasonable explanation)
[18:48:40] <Eviltwin> fiyarburst: .html() serializes the content into HTML
[18:48:56] <Eviltwin> And HTML can't represent everything that is present in the DOM
[18:50:29] <fiyarburst> so, if i attached the submit handler on after the content->html() call, it would work?
[18:50:32] <fiyarburst> let's try it
[18:53:57] <luvmyh0nda> wait
[18:57:02] <freebir> you guys, hi, I'm using jquery, with accordion, in more than 1 link, the problem is that the main page is getting too big, with the size of the accordion divs, that are not being displayed, how do I go arround this please ? http://www.lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/

[19:03:58] <fiyarburst> luvmyh0nda: wait?
[19:10:42] <freebir> anybody ?

[19:11:41] <luvmyh0nda> Eviltwin: i got it: http://jsfiddle.net/zRdnb/4/
[19:11:54] <luvmyh0nda> the key was to remove the last tab (the +), and then insert the new tab, and then re-add the (+)
[19:12:35] <luvmyh0nda> freebir: have you tried heightStyle: "content" ?
[19:13:20] <freebir> luvmyh0nda, how man ? where ?

[19:17:53] <luvmyh0nda> alx-: why not just use ajax?
[19:18:45] <freebir> luvmyh0nda, don't know how to do that, the code is in : http://www.lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/
[19:18:48] <alx-> luvmyh0nda: the iframe is a preview of a website, and the user has to be able to navigate through that site
[19:18:51] <freebir> i've tryed, but complained
[19:18:54] <freebir> luvmyh0nda,
[19:19:08] <freebir> I tryed to paste it all, complained
[19:21:07] <luvmyh0nda> alx-: hmmm, it could be iffy, depending on the end-user's internet connection, browser and system specs
[19:24:03] <freebir> luvmyh0nda, any ideas man ?
[19:24:19] <luvmyh0nda> freebir: give me a couple of minutes, i am looking at it

[19:25:46] <luvmyh0nda> $('#myModal3 #container').css('display','none');
[19:25:53] <luvmyh0nda> and then you need a conditional in your opener
[19:26:03] <luvmyh0nda> so that when the selected element is #myModal3, you display block
[19:26:58] <bubblehead> Hey folks...jquery n00b issue. I'm trying to loop through an array that displays the array items on an interval (fading them in an out). Can't seem to get it right. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/z_bull/Tpjrw/1/

[19:51:23] <bubblehead> luvmyh0nda thnx! much closer, but it crashes the browser(s). Loops through then display Item 3 a bunch of times, then locks up.
[19:52:26] <freebir> luvmyh0nda, they all work just fine, and the page is ok, but when I choose the myModal3, I get those small white areas, and when I go back, the roll bar is back
[20:00:20] <skypce> guys
[20:00:23] <skypce> help me please
[20:00:24] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/pWxqp/1/
[20:00:45] <skypce> i need that my script add class when scroll it is center of screen
[20:02:49] <luvmyh0nda> freebir still here, just looking around
[20:07:30] <lenswipee> hey, should i replace $('.foo').click(do_something) with $('.foo').on('click',do_something)? what's in vogue/better?
[20:30:57] <shoky> lenswipee: they are exactly the same thing
[20:31:16] <lenswipee> shoky: can't be.
[20:31:26] <shoky> if you say so
[20:31:34] <lenswipee> shoky: one uses .on
[20:32:05] <shoky> lenswipee: have i ever lied to you
[20:32:36] <shoky> btw,  $('.foo').bind('click', do_something)  is also exactly the same thing as those two
[20:33:00] <lenswipee> shoky: so what's better? .bind or .on?
[20:33:14] <shoky> they are exactly the same thing. neither is better or worse
[20:33:21] <shoky> .click is shorter
[20:33:30] <lenswipee> shoky: there must be a subtle difference. they all can't be exactly the same can they
[20:33:53] <shoky> no difference at all, 100% positive, no doubts at all
[20:34:54] <lenswipee> ?on
[20:34:54] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:34:55] <lenswipee> ?bind
[20:34:55] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[20:34:55] <shoky> notice i didn't say that .click, .on, and .bind  are exactly the same
[20:34:55] <shoky> all i said is that  .click(fn),  .on('click', fn),  and .bind('click', fn)  are exactly the same
[20:35:38] <shoky> .on can be used in other ways too, which are not the same
[20:35:46] <shoky> .click is just there as a shortcut
[20:35:51] <lenswipee> when to use .on vs .bind
[20:36:13] <shoky> if you want to do something that .on can do  that .bind cannot do
[20:36:17] <shoky> such as event delegation
[20:36:18] <lenswipee> anyway, .on is "preferred way"
[20:36:42] <lenswipee> so .on is more advanced? of course it is, its the prefererd way
[20:36:51] <shoky> it has more capabilities
[20:36:55] <shoky> if used differently
[20:37:10] <shoky> such as.. event delegation
[20:37:20] <lenswipee> okay
[20:38:30] <jaydev> Hi, I have a question. Please refer this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/MehSt/13/  . My qustion is that how to cache $(this) in a variable ?
[20:39:30] <shoky> jaydev: var elem = $(this);
[20:39:31] <jaydev> hello
[20:39:49] <shoky> (inside one of those functions, not outside)
[20:39:56] <jaydev> ya but where to add that ?
[20:40:10] <shoky> in each function that you're using it more than once
[20:40:28] <jaydev> yes, so I want to cache it for one time
[20:40:39] <shoky> no you don't
[20:40:49] <jaydev> like this
[20:40:50] <jaydev> var nav = $('.nav');
[20:40:57] <shoky> those are 3 separate event handlers
[20:41:50] <jaydev> so so for every event handler, I have to do var elem = $(this); ?
[20:42:17] <shoky> yes, because each event handler gets its own "this"
[20:42:31] <tw2113> ahhh context
[20:42:39] <shoky> if you tried to cache it outside, you wouldn't know which one of the .nav elements to cache..
[20:43:08] <shoky> if you had only one .nav element, then you could just use that "nav" variable you defined. but you have more than one .nav element
[20:43:25] <jaydev> OK, can not we cache inside nav.on({ ...}); ?
[20:43:45] <shoky> no, caching needs a line of code
[20:44:01] <shoky> { ... }  is an object literal, it doesnt contain code. only key:value pairs
[20:44:11] <shoky> the values can be functions , they contain code
[20:44:50] <shoky> think about it.. it does not make sense to cahce it outside of the event handler, because each event could be triggered on a different .nav element
[20:45:08] <jaydev> got it.
[20:45:17] <tw2113> var foo = { 'mymethod' = function() };
[20:45:21] <tw2113> if i recall correctly
[20:45:32] <tw2113> that would give you foo.mymethod()
[20:45:32] * shoky tases tw2113 repeatedly
[20:45:39] <tw2113> *shuts up*
[20:45:53] <tw2113> i get the hit
[20:45:55] <tw2113> hint*
[20:46:00] <shoky> jaydev don't listen to him ;p
[20:46:03] <tw2113> never
[20:46:04] <tw2113> ever
[20:46:35] <shoky> were you joking or being srs, i couldn't tell ;p
[20:46:58] <tw2113> i honestly was trying to contribute, but the tazing told me i was wrong
[20:47:06] <tw2113> so i flipped to humor
[20:47:20] <jaydev> shoky - then what is the best way to write this code, so that I can avoid calling $(this) more than one time?
[20:47:24] <shoky> teehee
[20:47:45] <tw2113> i need to work on my js writing
[20:48:05] <shoky> jaydev: http://jsfiddle.net/MehSt/14/   this is the best you can do
[20:48:20] <jaydev> let me check it
[20:48:26] <shoky> remember...... each event handler gets a new "this" each time it's triggered
[20:49:50] <jaydev> ya knew that... I just thought that It could be more optimized
[20:50:26] <shoky> wouldn't make any sense if it could
[20:50:37] <jaydev> true
[20:51:12] <jaydev> thanks for providing me clarity
[20:51:24] <shoky> np
[20:52:26] <BillCriswell> shoky: Do you sleep? =)
[20:53:31] <tw2113> whenever you're not here BillCriswell
[20:53:34] <shoky> ;] yea but i keep changing my sleeping hours to confuse y'all
[20:53:51] <BillCriswell> tw2113, shoky: Haha.
[20:54:02] <shoky> going to sleep in ~15 min ;p
[20:54:12] <lenswipee> tw2113 is weak at jquery but strong a wordpress :)
[20:54:16] <tw2113> i heard shoky can detect when BillCriswell is coming, and rushes to log in
[20:54:23] <shoky> ;D
[20:54:33] <BillCriswell> He better not be able to! He knows I like my privacies.
[20:54:41] <tw2113> lenswipee, it happens, i have a lot more hands on WP experience
[20:54:48] <tw2113> but i do alright with jquery
[20:54:53] <lenswipee> lol
[20:54:55] <tw2113> and what i tried above was straight js
[20:55:17] <lenswipee> it's all good
[20:55:18] <BillCriswell> I'm laying in bed watching Rubber for the 10th time. Love this shit.
[20:56:03] <shoky> Stars: Goodyear
[20:56:05] <shoky> wat
[20:56:32] <shoky> oh.
[20:57:08] <BillCriswell> Haha
[20:57:16] <BillCriswell> Robert seems like a nice guy for the most part.
[20:59:33] <shoky> reading the description, i think of attack of the killer tomatoes
[21:00:38] <shoky> i knowww im going to miss her. a tomaaaato ate my sister
[21:01:24] <BillCriswell> Is that literally about killer tomatoes? Cause maybe I'll turn tht on.
[21:01:34] <shoky> hell yea
[21:01:58] <tw2113> campy as heck
[21:02:08] <BillCriswell> I love campy.
[21:02:23] <shoky> what's campy :\
[21:02:33] <shoky> i mean, what does it mean
[21:03:07] <shoky> oic
[21:03:08] <BillCriswell> shoky: I relate it to corny and enjoyable
[21:03:19] <shoky> urbandictionary says  adj. being so extreme that it has an amusing and perversely sophisticated appeal.
[21:03:39] <BillCriswell> Rubber is extremely well done for a movie about a tire that can blow shit up with its mind.
[21:03:39] <shoky> i'd say that's spot on
[21:03:41] <tw2113> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=campy
[21:11:16] <DelicateFlower> why wont' this http://pastebin.com/BXtDpJsg work??
[21:12:23] <shoky> DelicateFlower: $(el)   or $(this)  instead of el
[21:12:25] <BillCriswell> DelicateFlower: I think you might need to do $(el)
[21:12:34] <BillCriswell> Ninja.
[21:12:36] <DelicateFlower> oh
[21:12:58] <DelicateFlower> i would imagine each el would alreayd be a jquery object...
[21:13:04] <shoky> nope
[21:13:25] <BillCriswell> shoky: I have on Return of the Killer Tomatoes right now since it's on Netflix.
[21:13:44] <BillCriswell> Nice white people on the beach dance scene about 3 minutes in.
[21:13:54] <shoky> BillCriswell: i remember i liked that too when i was a kid, don't think i've seen it since
[21:14:38] <BillCriswell> It seems terrible so far, in a good way.
[21:14:48] <shoky> ;]
[21:15:14] <BillCriswell> Soundtrack is top notch.
[21:16:23] <BillCriswell> Oh shit. George Clooney.
[21:18:24] <shoky> lol
[21:22:46] <ChrisBolton> Anyone familiar with Fancybox? I'm trying to implement the gallery feature and it's not working â€¦ https://gist.github.com/Iknewthisguy/5882444
[21:23:59] <BillCriswell> I read "photo" as potato
[21:24:02] <BillCriswell> what is wrong with me.
[21:26:04] <tw2113> hungry for fries
[21:26:25] <BillCriswell> ChrisBolton: You want the rel on the <a>, not the <img>
[21:29:21] <ChrisBolton> BillCriswell: I changed it. Still not working â€¦ http://pastie.org/8090110 Here's my revised rendered html
[21:30:51] <BillCriswell> ChrisBolton:How are you calling fancybox? $('a[rel=gallery]') should do the trick.
[21:31:24] <BillCriswell> Well, how are you selecting the fancy...ness
[21:32:05] <BillCriswell> Your current selector .painting would not work.
[21:32:05] <ChrisBolton> I added it to the link_to image_tag. In my view file.
[21:32:39] <ChrisBolton> Should I base it on .painting_anchor
[21:33:08] <BillCriswell> That can work as well I believe.
[21:33:21] <BillCriswell> .painting_anchor a
[21:36:55] <ChrisBolton> pointing fancy box to the anchor selector isn't applying the fancy box
[21:39:16] <BillCriswell> ChrisBolton: Do you have each a in a .painting_anchor ? You might have to use the common parent for ALL the links, not each individually. Does $('a[rel=gallery]') work?
[21:39:40] <ChrisBolton> as a selector?
[21:40:35] <BillCriswell> Yes. Does it get fancybox working the way you want.
[21:42:29] <ChrisBolton> Nope.
[21:42:40] <ChrisBolton> $('a[rel=group]').fancybox()
[21:43:44] <ChrisBolton> http://pastie.org/8090129
[21:43:50] <ChrisBolton> This is the html rendered.
[21:44:09] <BillCriswell> Is there an error in the console?
[21:44:12] <BillCriswell> Something obvious?
[21:47:24] <ChrisBolton> Not that I'm seeing.
[21:47:57] <ChrisBolton> If I use the .painting or .painting_anchor selector I get a fancy box I'm just not able to use the side scrolling arrows.
[21:56:33] <ChrisBolton> BillCriswell: Thanks for your help. I'm going to sleep on it. Hopefully it makes more sense tomorrow.
[21:56:46] <BillCriswell> Haha. In the same boat.
[21:56:51] <BillCriswell> Good night and good luck.
[21:59:37] <ChrisBolton> Thanks.
[22:15:05] <ashitvora1> Hi :)
[22:15:25] <ashitvora1> Any idea how can we display XML content in a DIV?
[22:15:45] <ashitvora1> using .html() removes all tags and just displays content within :(
[22:18:08] <Eviltwin> ashitvora1: Use .text()
[22:25:14] <ashitvora1> It doesnt work either :(
[22:29:11] <Eviltwin> ashitvora1: Maybe you can show me the input you have and the output you're trying to achieve
[22:29:37] <ashitvora1> Input is an xml file. I'm fetching the file via ajax.
[22:29:47] <Eviltwin> Okay
[22:29:51] <ashitvora1> when I display output in console, I see it.
[22:30:07] <ashitvora1> but when I display it in Dialog, I dont get expected result.
[22:30:15] <Eviltwin> And what is the expected result
[22:30:17] <Eviltwin> Vs what you're seeing
[22:30:37] <ashitvora1> If I do .text(), I loose all indentations
[22:30:54] <ashitvora1> If I do .html() I loose all Tags and just see content within it
[22:31:10] <grafi> try pasing inside a <pre> maybe?
[22:31:12] <Eviltwin> Set white-space: pre-wrap; as a CSS property
[22:33:19] <ashitvora1>  (y)
[22:33:20] <ashitvora1> +1
[22:33:24] <ashitvora1> that worked :)
[22:33:26] <ashitvora1> thanks :)
[22:33:39] <ashitvora1> white-space: pre-wrap.
[22:33:47] <Eviltwin> Yup, there's also white-space: pre;
[22:33:50] <Eviltwin> Which prevents wrapping from happening
[22:33:54] <Eviltwin> But I figured you'd want it to wrap
[22:33:59] <ashitvora1> grafi, I did try wrapping the cntent within <pre> but that didnt gave expected result.
[22:34:18] <Eviltwin> It's also a very bad idea
[22:34:54] <grafi> but shouldnt those two be very similar solutions?
[23:02:23] <dirkpennings> hi guys, is there a way to prevent the default behaviour when clicking 1) left mouse button, 2) middle mouse button, 3) right mouse button? I have to append querystring parameters to the url when clicking and then continue to that url
[23:06:15] <dirkpennings> when clicking with the middle (scroll) mouse button, it automatically opens a new tab, before I can rewrite the url
[23:13:55] <gry> is there a standard jquery idiom to work with textboxes  (or a set of textboxes) that needn't be empty, and some event that happens once they're all been filled in, such as a next part of form displayed or something?
[23:26:21] <Cork> gry: var input = $(':input'); input.on('change', function() { if(input.filter(function() { return $(this).val() == '' }).length > 0) { return; } });
[23:28:07] <gry> ':input' does what?
[23:29:02] <Cork> ?:input
[23:29:02] <bot-t> :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[23:29:34] <gry> ta
[23:29:35] <Cork> but ya, i normally just do $('input, select, textarea') for those
[23:50:55] <DelicateFlower> how do i make int into a string?
[23:52:52] <Eviltwin> DelicateFlower: Depends on the circumstances
[23:52:59] <Eviltwin> DelicateFlower: Where do you need this to happen?
[23:54:32] <DelicateFlower> that's a weird question to which i dont know how to answer...
[23:54:58] <Eviltwin> DelicateFlower: Why'd you ask your question in the first place?
[23:55:19] <Cork> ?eval 1000 + ""
[23:55:22] <bot-t> Cork: "1000"
[23:55:38] <Cork> ?eval 1000.toString()
[23:55:38] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[23:55:43] <Cork> ?eval (1000).toString()
[23:55:44] <bot-t> Cork: "1000"
[23:55:48] <Eviltwin> ?eval 1000..toString()
[23:55:48] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "1000"
[23:55:50] <Eviltwin> Boom!
[23:55:51] <Cork> your choice
[23:55:59] <Cork> two dots...
[23:56:13] <Eviltwin> (1000.) is parsed as a number
[23:56:24] <Cork> ya, i get why
[23:56:30] <Cork> didn't know it worked though
[23:56:40] <Cork> ?eval 1000.0.toString()
[23:56:40] <bot-t> Cork: "1000"
[23:56:44] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I've read enough stuff about JS quirks to know
[23:57:09] <DelicateFlower1> sorry i got disconnected
[23:57:14] <Cork> lol
[23:57:18] <Eviltwin> DelicateFlower: Why did you ask your question?
[23:57:18] <DelicateFlower1> did anybody say anything related to me?
[23:57:22] <Eviltwin> Where are you trying to do this?
[23:57:37] <Eviltwin> Cork: Have you seen this one?
[23:57:40] <Eviltwin> ?eval {} + []
[23:57:41] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 0
[23:57:46] <Eviltwin> ?eval ({} + []).length
[23:57:47] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 15
[23:59:28] <Eviltwin> DelicateFlower1: Why did you ask your question?
[23:59:30] <Eviltwin> Where are you trying to do this?
[23:59:43] <Cork> DelicateFlower1: <Cork> ?eval 1000 + ""
[23:59:43] <Cork> <bot-t> Cork: "1000"
[23:59:43] <Cork> <Cork> ?eval (1000).toString()
