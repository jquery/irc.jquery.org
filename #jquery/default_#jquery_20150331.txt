[00:01:15] <babykosh> how do I write something like‚Ä¶$(this).find(‚Äúi‚Äù).[with_element_id = 264].addClass( ‚Äúred‚Äù );
[00:03:34] <babykosh> basically I want to find all the <i> tags with an id=264
[00:06:13] <forQuery> $(this).find("#264")
[00:06:32] <forQuery> no need for the i tag, it's an id and only exists once on the page
[00:06:56] <forQuery> but, can ids begin with number? i dont think so...
[00:26:37] <babykosh> I got it
[00:27:44] <babykosh> thank you gods
[00:28:01] <babykosh> especial forQuery
[01:34:24] <kokut> Hello, anyone has some experience with jquery-sticky? It's adding a sticky-wrapper with height and displacing the content in my website.
[01:40:28] <ScottyKnows> Hi guys, I'm stuck with a weird issue here. I have a function called renderButtons() that manipulates few DOM elements, removes and adds class and appends to a new container. This seems to work only on the initial rendering, that is, when the server is started, it works as its supposed to, but then on reload/refresh it fails, i dont know whats going wrong. Thoughts?
[01:41:07] <Cork> ScottyKnows: make sure you don't have duplicate ids in the page
[01:41:20] <Cork> also make sure you use .ready so you don't run before the dom is ready
[01:41:34] <Cork> that is the two most likely causes
[01:42:15] <ScottyKnows> I'm using .ready, so thats not it, i should maybe check for duplicate ids then
[01:43:51] <Xatenev> If the firefox firebug console shows ["11"] it means its an array or?
[01:44:26] <Cork> Xatenev: it means the same thing you would get if you wrote that in a parser
[01:44:28] <Cork> or a console
[01:44:42] <Xatenev> Ok so i guess its an array
[01:44:42] <Xatenev> ^^
[01:45:02] <Xatenev> Im just wondering cause it says .each is not a function
[01:45:07] <Xatenev> but its maybe cause its no jquery object, trxying now
[01:45:26] <Cork> Xatenev: as it contains a string, and not dom elements
[01:45:34] <Cork> ya, most likely not a jquery object
[01:45:44] <Xatenev> ha it works :)
[01:45:48] <Xatenev> juist had to wrap it into $()
[01:45:52] <Cork> uh... no
[01:45:56] <Cork> use $.each
[01:46:04] <Cork> $.each(arr, function() {})
[01:46:26] <Cork> .each i meas for jquery objects, and jquery objects is means for dom elements
[01:46:27] <Cork> not strings
[01:46:53] <Xatenev> $.each ?
[01:46:56] <Cork> yes
[01:47:07] <ScottyKnows> Cork: I dont have any duplicate ids. And this is really weird now, When I try it on Incognito, it works when I follow the links(click on "sign in" or something) but not when i Refresh it
[01:47:08] <Cork> ?api jquery.each
[01:47:08] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.each(): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[01:47:21] <ScottyKnows> and if i'm not on incognito it doesnt work either ways, very weird
[01:47:47] <Cork> ScottyKnows: you have a live demo?
[01:49:14] <ScottyKnows> I'm afraid not :/ its just a part of this big ass application, and its not live yet
[01:49:46] <Cork> ScottyKnows: ok, then add console.log entries in the code
[01:50:00] <Cork> to make sure all parts of the code is executed as expected
[01:50:49] <ScottyKnows> Uh..Okay. But when i tried to call render() from the console, sometimes it renders and other times it says undefined
[01:51:02] <smokeyd> hey all. Is it possible to use jquery on just a string of html code. Like $('<html><body class="someclass"></body></html').find('.someclass')
[01:51:27] <Cork> ScottyKnows: then you have a source, sounds like the function isn't always around
[01:51:38] <Cork> ScottyKnows: so check how it is loaded and go from there
[01:51:57] <Cork> smokeyd: yes, except none of those tags are valid
[01:52:13] <Cork> smokeyd: only the elements you have inside body is allowed
[01:52:41] <Cork> (as jquery works with dom fragments, and they can only hold elements)
[01:53:24] <ScottyKnows> Also, i have multiple errors saying 'denying load of chrome extension://' 'Resources must be listed in the web_accessible_resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension.'
[01:53:28] <ScottyKnows> Is that relevant?
[01:53:59] <Cork> ScottyKnows: might be, if you're making an extension and not a webpage
[01:54:07] <Cork> if you are, ask in a relevant channel
[01:54:10] <ScottyKnows> I'm not making an extension
[01:54:39] <ScottyKnows> I just assumed it could be some sort of a jQuery error
[01:54:41] <Cork> ScottyKnows: then it just means you have a broken extension installed
[01:55:05] <Cork> extension:// <--
[01:55:07] <ScottyKnows> Alright, so I'll ignore that
[01:55:18] <ScottyKnows> "chrome-extension://gkojfkhlekighikafcpjkiklfbnlmeio/js/jquery.min.map"
[01:55:41] <Cork> so you have a broken extensions that relies on jquery
[01:56:17] <ScottyKnows> Oh okay, as long as it doesnt concern the issue at hand, i'm going to ignore that
[01:56:38] <smokeyd> CorK: ok, I try this: console.log($("<html><head></head><body><h1>Test</h1></body></html>").find('h1').length) which still returns 0
[01:56:56] <Cork> smokeyd: ya, cause what you will have is the <h1>
[01:56:56] <ScottyKnows> Thanks Cork! I'll just look into how its being loaded.
[01:57:11] <smokeyd> Cork: ok, now I start to get it
[01:57:15] <smokeyd> :)
[01:57:15] <smokeyd> thanks
[01:57:24] <Cork> smokeyd: html and head is html tags that don't have a corelated dom element
[01:57:37] <Cork> its "fake" elements if you like
[01:58:19] <Cork> smokeyd: so a better option is to test console.log($("<h1>Test</h1>").length)
[02:02:16] <momomo> hi, when you load a script dynamically, is there a way to get the status code on error, wether it is a 404 403 or something else? element.onerror doesn't seem to include the status code.
[02:02:57] <Cork> momomo: you load it with $.getScript or what?
[02:03:43] <momomo> document.createElement("script")...
[02:03:54] <Cork> ah
[02:04:23] <momomo> does getScript contain the status code?
[02:04:35] <Cork> yes
[02:04:43] <Cork> as it uses ajax and not <script>
[02:04:51] <Cork> as long as the script is loaded from the same domain that is
[02:05:11] <momomo> hmm ook
[02:05:13] <Cork> if it is cross domain it uses <script> and as far as i know doesn't even fire the error handler
[02:05:31] <Cork> (as ie <9 doesn't support on error on <script>)
[02:07:23] <momomo> i see
[02:09:15] <momomo> Cork, firebug seems to log the error 403 ..
[02:09:29] <Cork> momomo: sure, but that is chrome code
[02:09:43] <Cork> chrome code has access to basically everything
[02:10:11] <Cork> content is untrusted code and much much tighter restrictions to what they are allowed to do
[02:10:37] <ahop> How to get the absolute position of an element?
[02:10:51] <momomo> element.offset().top
[02:10:51] <ahop> $('#myelt").position().top  seems to give relative pos...
[02:10:57] <ahop> (relative to the parent)
[02:11:08] <Cork> ?api offset
[02:11:08] <b-ot> Cork: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[02:11:29] <Cork> yes the naming on those functions are a mess
[02:11:56] <ahop> thanks a lot, it works now :)
[02:15:57] <motaka2> is this the right way to check if a variable is undefined ?
[02:15:58] <motaka2> confsFin.doOnSelectItem !== undefined
[02:16:15] <paul_true> hi;)
[02:16:15] <paul_true> in my code i got a table, which got multiple entries. the view is limited to 10 entries, thats why i bind my events with a delegate to the following entries.
[02:16:15] <paul_true> i got a click event inside an other. now i have to click twice to fire the inner click-event.
[02:16:15] <paul_true> code looks like this : http://pastebin.com/iCYGWEz5
[02:16:15] <paul_true> any solutions how i can fire the inner click event on the first click?
[02:16:32] <Cork> motaka2: its the correct way to check if a property is defined
[02:16:40] <Cork> motaka2: it doesn't work for variables
[02:17:08] <Cork> motaka2: for variables you have to use typeof
[02:18:51] <motaka2> Cork: typeof confsFin.doOnSelectItem !== undefined
[02:18:55] <Cork> no
[02:18:56] <motaka2> right ?
[02:19:07] <Cork> doOnSelectItem is a property
[02:19:11] <Cork> but you asked about variables
[02:19:19] <Cork> you need to understand the difference
[02:20:04] <motaka2> so now I now that I am working with a property
[02:20:05] <Cork> motaka2: if(a == undefined) == parer error
[02:20:17] <Cork> motaka2: var a; if(a == undefined) == ok
[02:20:35] <motaka2> how can I check if a property is not defined?
[02:20:35] <Cork> motaka2: if(typeof(a) == "undefined") == ok
[02:20:49] <Cork> motaka2: the way you you asked to start with
[02:21:09] <Cork> motaka2: var a = {}; if(a.b == undefined) == ok
[02:21:44] <Cork> s/parer/parser/
[02:21:57] <motaka2> if (typeof (confsFin.doOnSelectItem) != "undefined")
[02:22:12] <Cork> motaka2: read through what i've said again
[02:23:10] <motaka2> i know the diff between prop and var, but i dont understand you
[02:23:28] <Cork> as i've said how you do it for properties and how you do it for variables
[02:23:38] <Cork> but you use the reverse, i'm not sure you do
[02:24:39] <motaka2> headache
[02:25:01] <Cork> take the two last if examples i gave you
[02:25:06] <Cork> that is how you do it
[02:25:22] <Cork> the last one is for properties and the second last is for variables
[02:25:42] <Cork> as you can't use and undefined variable, as that will create an exception in the parser
[02:25:58] <motaka2> if (typeof confsFin.doOnSelectItem != undefine
[02:25:58] <Cork> that is why you need to handle them differently
[02:26:04] <Cork> ...
[02:26:09] * Cork gives up
[02:26:32] <Cork> motaka2: where did i type that combination?
[02:26:40] <motaka2> can you give me the right code  based on my vars, maybe I understand like so
[02:27:02] <Cork> motaka2: think a little
[02:27:23] <Cork> motaka2: if(typeof(a) == "undefined") == ok
[02:27:25] <motaka2> Cork: var a = {}; if(a.b == undefined) == ok seems to match my case
[02:27:29] <Cork> motaka2: var a = {}; if(a.b == undefined) == ok
[02:28:11] <motaka2> Cork: you meen != doesnt work ?
[02:28:20] <Cork> no, i don't mean that
[02:28:49] <motaka2> I hate js
[02:28:59] <Cork> motaka2: if(a == undefined) == parer error <-- do you understand what i mean here?
[02:29:11] <Cork> that is the core of what i've tried to explain
[02:29:31] <motaka2> if (confsFin.doOnSelectItem != undefined)
[02:29:43] <Cork> stop throwing around code and try to understand the problem
[02:29:56] <motaka2> id ont understand it
[02:30:17] <Cork> if you try to use a variable the isn't defined you get parser errors
[02:30:19] <motaka2> but if you give me the right code I might
[02:30:31] <Cork> so you can't check if the undefined variable exist by checking it against defined
[02:30:35] <Cork> *undefined
[02:31:01] <Cork> so for that case you need to use typeof(noneExistingVariableName)
[02:31:07] <Cork> as anything else will throw
[02:31:09] <motaka2> confsFin is defined
[02:31:12] <Cork> exactly
[02:31:30] <Cork> now read through the examples i've given you again
[02:31:36] <motaka2> but confsFin.doOnSelectItem is not defined in this case
[02:31:46] <Cork> yes, but that isn't a variable
[02:31:56] <motaka2> yes
[02:31:56] <Cork> as i've said several times, there is a difference there
[02:32:04] <motaka2> so what should I do ?
[02:32:24] <Cork> do i have to quote my self?!?
[02:32:28] <Cork> i've already answered it
[02:32:37] <motaka2> so my case is var a = {}; if(a.b == undefined) == ok
[02:32:39] <Cork> "<Cork> motaka2: its the correct way to check if a property is defined"#
[02:33:09] <motaka2> right ?
[02:34:06] <motaka2> I hate it
[02:34:10] <motaka2> I just hate it
[02:34:25] <paul_true> hi;)
[02:34:25] <Cork> then start using your head and it becomes easier
[02:34:26] <paul_true> in my code i got a table, which got multiple entries. the view is limited to 10 entries, thats why i bind my events with a delegate to the following entries.
[02:34:26] <paul_true> i got a click event inside an other. now i have to click twice to fire the inner click-event.
[02:34:26] <paul_true> code looks like this : http://pastebin.com/iCYGWEz5
[02:34:26] <paul_true> any solutions how i can fire the inner click event on the first click?
[02:34:36] <Cork> paul_true: please stop spamming the channel
[02:35:32] <paul_true> thats not spam.. thats acutally a question. i thought because a√≥f those many post my question will die not readed
[02:35:43] <Cork> paul_true: pasting 6 lines to ask a question is spaming
[02:36:28] <paul_true> line break = new line post. sorry that i live
[02:41:10] <motaka2> Cork: I should use in operator
[02:41:36] <Cork> motaka2: take the comments i've given you and read it though carefully again
[02:41:49] <Cork> i've answered you're question several times now
[02:47:20] <Uhkis> aww, true paul left
[02:47:42] <Uhkis> that code was pretty funny
[02:50:04] <Xatenev> Heya
[02:50:06] <Xatenev> whats wrong here: $("[data-parent='" + obj.val() + "'")
[02:50:17] <Xatenev> it tells me unrecognized expression [data-parent='1'
[02:50:21] <Cork> closing bracket
[02:50:30] <Xatenev> oh crap
[02:50:30] <Xatenev> xd
[02:50:39] <Xatenev> im ablinded i guess
[02:50:46] <Cork> heh the error message even told you :)
[02:51:08] <Uhkis> still with the " ' mess, huh ;)
[02:51:34] <motaka2> the best way is to use "in"
[02:52:25] <Xatenev> :P
[02:52:49] <Xatenev> js kills my brain
[02:52:54] <Xatenev> probably cause im just doing things completly wrong
[02:52:54] <Xatenev> xD
[02:55:26] <Xatenev> gg im done
[02:55:27] <Xatenev> D
[02:55:32] <Xatenev> i have to pay somebody for this JS shit really
[02:58:01] <Cork> Xatenev: the best is to use .filter
[02:58:26] <Cork> Xatenev: also don't just use [] as a selector
[02:58:35] <Cork> as that means the browser has to loop every element in the page
[02:58:58] <Cork> so parent.find('elm'
[02:59:00] <Cork> opps
[02:59:17] <Xatenev> okay..
[02:59:32] <Cork> so parent.find('elm').filter(function() { return  $(this).data('parent') == parentValue });
[02:59:43] <Cork> if usually the better option
[02:59:53] <Xatenev> okay tanx
[03:24:39] <kokut> Hello, i installed a plugin "Theia sticky sidebar" and it should work out of the box, its adding the class to my sidebar and everything but its not working and it's not throwing any errors either.
[03:39:55] <DarsVaeda> I wonder why I can't use this handle for my sortable? http://pastie.org/private/h6cjpn6mxvf83wdiof5aa
[03:50:53] <Xatenev> Another question
[03:50:58] <Xatenev> i have <span><span><input>
[03:51:07] <Xatenev> when i start at input with my jquery selector, how do i get to the first span?
[03:51:13] <Xatenev> .parent().parent() doesnt seem to work
[03:51:24] <arthurvr> Fiddle?
[03:51:34] <arthurvr> `paste @ Xatenev
[03:51:38] <b-ot> Xatenev: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:51:44] <Xatenev> can make one, not sure if its needed though^^ cause i just want 2 elements up
[03:52:40] <arthurvr> Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/c5jg3pqw/
[03:52:44] <arthurvr> Works isn‚Äôt it?
[03:53:00] <arthurvr> Xatenev: That‚Äôs why I asked for a fiddle.
[03:53:02] <Xatenev> Hm i tried paent parent there
[03:53:04] <Xatenev> i will try again
[03:53:05] <Xatenev> :p
[03:53:39] <arthurvr> Xatenev: That‚Äôs why I ask for a fiddle, to encapsulate the problem. It‚Äôs likely to not be this code that isn‚Äôt working, you know
[03:54:09] <Xatenev> yea i get u
[03:54:19] <Xatenev> but if parent() parent() is working i am able to find the problem myself
[03:54:19] <Xatenev> :p
[03:54:21] <decx> DarsVaeda: remove the items selector from the handle (just header span)
[03:54:44] <sanjayb> Xatenev, rest assured, .parent().parent() does work like you would expect it to.
[03:55:01] <Xatenev> yup okej
[03:55:37] <DarsVaeda> ahh thanks decx
[03:56:53] <Xatenev> yap got it solved
[03:57:12] <arthurvr> Xatenev: glad to hear that. What was the real problem?
[03:59:23] <Xatenev> started at the wrong element
[03:59:23] <Xatenev> :P
[03:59:36] <Xatenev> cause it goes into the function twice
[03:59:40] <Xatenev> and i just looked at the first console.log
[03:59:51] <arthurvr> k
[04:04:24] <jacobz1> Anyone know of HTML-editor that kinda looks like uxpin? Like drag/drop elements and absolute positions
[04:11:17] <havardge> I'm using jquery to get data with the following (simplified) format: http://pastebin.com/AfZAE6TH
[04:12:10] <havardge> The result is an array of objects, where each object has a key and value, but the key is autogenerated
[04:12:16] <havardge> starting from 0, 1
[04:12:39] <havardge> How can I parse the json and skip these autogenerated keys
[04:13:34] <Cork> havardge: you can't at parsing time
[04:13:44] <Cork> you would have to loop the array and create a new array
[04:13:54] <havardge> Ok, thanks :)
[04:14:21] <Cork> havardge: var arr = $.map(data, function(elm) { return elm.data; });
[04:14:58] <havardge> Ah perfect! :) thanks man
[04:17:48] <Elirips> Hello. If an ajax-request is returned from the server, can I somehow modify the header before its being processed by the browser?
[04:18:02] <Cork> no
[04:18:14] <Cork> well you can server side, or in a proxy
[04:18:25] <Cork> but not from inside the page
[04:18:30] <Elirips> okay, thanks
[04:19:33] <Elirips> unfortunately, we already have a proxy inbetween. And that proxy is setting a wrong header, but so we need to fix that on the proxy
[04:24:07] <dimi1947> do you see anything wrong with this syntax: $('input#from_'+id[1],'input#till_'+id[1]).prop('disabled',true); it does not work...id[1] is an array member which is a string
[04:24:46] <akshayvishnoi> i think you have added , after id[1]
[04:25:20] <akshayvishnoi> after this  - (‚Äòinput#from_'+id[1] ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî there is a comma operator
[04:25:26] <dimi1947> I do understand what do you mean
[04:26:27] <dimi1947> I do not understand
[04:26:37] <akshayvishnoi> its not correct syntax, you are using comma operator outside quotes.
[04:28:17] <akshayvishnoi> also try to make your selector in a single string it will work
[04:28:24] <dimi1947> now I understand but I cannot find how to do it exactly...I have tried various combinations
[04:29:53] <akshayvishnoi> try this - $('input#from_' + id[1] + ',input#till_' + id[1])
[04:32:07] <dimi1947> yes...that worked thanks...it was an issue of syntax after all
[04:34:05] <dimi1947> I am using hyrdaIRC...does anyone use it...cause I have to make a question about it
[04:34:36] <akshayvishnoi> Great!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

[05:07:12] <arthurvr> lol
[05:07:16] <Cork> O_o
[05:07:54] <Cork> Omar-: that question doesn't really make sense
[05:08:32] <Omar-> lol
[05:08:33] <Omar-> why?
[05:08:40] <Omar-> not jQuery, in JS
[05:08:53] <decx> any loop will do
[05:08:55] <Cork> you mean how to select a set of elements by class?
[05:09:00] <Omar-> i have 10 elements and I want to use pure JS
[05:09:11] <Omar-> yup and attach same listener to them
[05:09:14] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll('.the-class')
[05:09:23] <Omar-> and then loop?
[05:09:30] <Cork> then loop it and do addEventListenener
[05:09:31] <Cork> yes
[05:09:42] <Altair123> ciao gente
[05:09:45] <Altair123> ^_^
[05:09:45] <decx> well you want a shim
[05:09:49] <Omar-> thanks Cork
[05:09:58] <Omar-> Altair123 hola hombre
[05:09:59] <decx> addEventListener, attachEvent and onfallback
[05:10:07] <Cork> well it depends of you need ie<10 support or not
[05:10:07] <Omar-> decx what's a shim?
[05:10:25] <Omar-> Cork let's say cross-browser support
[05:10:27] <decx> it's quite literal
[05:10:28] <Altair123> I am Italian and I don't speak English
[05:10:30] <Cork> a small function that handles that ie used a different function name up until ie10
[05:10:31] <nikhil_> shim is something you attach to something else
[05:10:38] <Altair123> I want to learn
[05:10:39] <nikhil_> to provide additional functionality
[05:10:39] <Altair123> ^_^
[05:10:40] <Omar-> Altair123 use google translate :P
[05:10:54] <Altair123> Ok Omar
[05:11:00] <nikhil_> often it is hacky but gets the job done. you're not sure where and how it might break
[05:11:01] <Altair123> I read you all
[05:11:18] <nikhil_> bonjourno Altair123
[05:11:25] <Omar-> Cork I will try it with addEventListener
[05:11:42] <Altair123> nikhil_ goodmornig to you
[05:12:07] <Cork> Omar-: basically a small function that does: if(document.addEventListener) { document.addEventListener() } else { document.attachEvent() }
[05:12:11] <nikhil_> Altair123, it is afternoon in ZA, but thank you. good morning :)
[05:12:12] <Cork> in this case
[05:13:00] <decx> Omar- quick example: http://jsfiddle.net/mpbeh1ny/
[05:13:00] <Altair123> nikhil_ I am sorry, good afternoon
[05:13:02] <Altair123> :-/
[05:13:42] <Altair123> I know a little jquery and something to HTML
[05:13:52] <Altair123> 5
[05:13:54] <Altair123> :-/
[05:15:11] <Omar-> is this code correct? http://jsfiddle.net/Lyhy8vac/
[05:15:22] <Omar-> sorryI made it before checking your demos/comments
[05:16:25] <Omar-> decx nice demo I'll adopt it
[05:19:46] <decx> i dont think any browsers that do touchstart don't have addEventListener
[05:20:37] <Omar-> so addEventListener should do the job?
[05:20:58] <decx> probably
[05:22:47] <Omar-> hmmm..I cant use forEach()
[05:22:54] <Omar-> I dont know why I'm getting an error
[05:23:01] <arthurvr> on the nodeset?
[05:23:08] <Omar-> yea
[05:23:10] <arthurvr> You can‚Äôt use forEach on nodesets
[05:23:12] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Lyhy8vac/ line 7
[05:23:22] <arthurvr> lemme fix that for you
[05:23:32] <Omar-> thanks arthurvr :)
[05:23:43] <decx> and where does box2 come from?
[05:23:44] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/Lyhy8vac/
[05:24:20] <decx> great fix arthurvr i can barely see the difference ;)
[05:24:23] <Omar-> decx :/ I forgot to change that lol
[05:24:33] <arthurvr> whoops http://jsfiddle.net/Lyhy8vac/1/
[05:25:14] <arthurvr> It‚Äôs array.prototype.forEach. A NodeList isn‚Äôt an array.
[05:26:27] <Omar-> thanks arthurvr. Its good to learn new things everyday
[05:26:28] <Omar-> :)
[05:26:33] <arthurvr> Browsers huh lol
[05:26:34] <arthurvr> :)
[05:26:48] <Omar-> haha
[05:27:44] <arthurvr> You can‚Äôt do things like .push on a nodelist as well
[05:29:53] <decx> is there a jquery equivalent of document.createDocumentFragment()?
[05:30:21] <Omar-> arthurvr because it's not an array
[05:30:24] <Omar-> right?
[05:30:27] <arthurvr> Yup.
[05:30:34] <arthurvr> It‚Äôs array-like :/
[05:30:48] <arthurvr> It‚Äôs a list of things but not an array
[05:31:00] <arthurvr> silly thing but pretty common confused
[05:33:20] <Omar-> yea, it's confusing
[05:33:46] <arthurvr> It is
[05:34:00] <Omar-> but fun!
[05:34:09] <arthurvr> sure thing
[05:34:23] <Omar-> what I like about coding is, solving problems
[05:34:53] <Omar-> that's why I play with code whenever I want to refresh my brain
[05:38:30] <Omar-> got it working now http://jsbin.com/poxipawofe
[05:38:40] <Omar-> thanks Cork, decx and arthurvr :)
[05:39:22] <arthurvr> Awesome
[05:40:20] <Altair123> gente... I have to go
[05:40:24] <Altair123> see you soon
[05:40:27] <Altair123> ^_*
[05:40:55] <decx> what's interesting about nodelists is that they are live
[05:41:32] <arthurvr> Yup
[05:42:28] <Omar-> what do you mean by live? the code I used will work for dynamically created elements?
[05:43:35] <decx> right http://jsfiddle.net/1wt90pxc/
[05:44:01] <arthurvr> it means that changes in the DOM are reflected in the collection, directly.
[05:44:49] <Omar-> nice
[05:44:51] <arthurvr> querySelectorAll isn‚Äôt live, though.
[05:44:58] <arthurvr> That would be tricky.
[05:45:21] <arthurvr> What it returns is static
[05:45:34] <arthurvr> but there are hunders of stack overflow posts about that lol
[05:46:06] <arthurvr> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28163033/when-is-nodelist-live-and-when-is-it-static
[05:47:38] <Omar-> speaking about SO: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CA4uIfNXIAATt7X.png:large
[05:48:25] <decx> metathreads are the worst when done lazy :(
[05:48:31] <arthurvr> haha
[05:53:13] <MeowZedong> is there going to be jQuery for things like HTML 5 Canvas?
[05:53:40] <MeowZedong> or HTML 5 in general, like off-line storage.
[05:53:46] <decx> it's too broad a topic to have a single framework
[05:53:53] <MeowZedong> oh
[05:53:53] <decx> there are animation framekworks for canvas
[05:54:28] <MeowZedong> oh yeah, cool man, what‚Äôs the framework called?
[05:55:19] <decx> i dont use any so i suggest googling ^^
[05:55:26] <MeowZedong> i‚Äôll try
[05:58:20] <Omar-> MeowZedong http://animateyourhtml5.appspot.com/pres/index.html?lang=en#1
[05:59:46] <jeffreylevesque> if i have a GET request (query string), and it's processed on the server (i.e. python), how do i get the return value in jquery?
[06:00:12] <jeffreylevesque> i usually use $.ajax() with POST
[06:00:39] <jeffreylevesque> but, GET, and not an ordinary DOM element executing the action - but, rather url arguments
[06:03:02] <MeowZedong> thank you
[06:03:57] <decx> i'd say if you want to get into canvas graphics programming you should start out vanilla and then when you get more comfortable you'll have a much better overview over what kind of framework you want to use
[06:04:44] <MeowZedong> okay
[06:05:17] <Omar-> nice library https://github.com/pornel/slip
[06:24:49] <abailarri> Hello. Something strange happens me. I'm working with fullcalndar plugn v1.5.6, and in the drop function, when I console an output I see some values, but hwen I consol more spcecific output it not retusn anythins!! https://jsfiddle.net/awm10p19/
[06:24:54] <abailarri> any suggestion please?
[06:28:01] <Xatenev> Heya
[06:28:09] <Xatenev> is there a possibility to check if an event listener has already been attached to an element?
[06:28:31] <Cork> abailarri: use Object.keys(copiedEventObject)
[06:29:21] <Cork> abailarri: might be there is something like a space in the keyname or something like that
[06:29:37] <Cork> Xatenev: no
[06:29:44] <Xatenev> Rly not o>o
[06:29:51] <Xatenev> Seems to me like a needed feature, or am i missing something? :P
[06:29:54] <Cork> Xatenev: browser doesn't expose the attached events at all
[06:30:17] <Cork> Xatenev: not really, the code can keep this info if it needs it
[06:30:33] <decx> Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/3jm10nq7/
[06:31:01] <Xatenev> decx: Ah cool
[06:33:07] <abailarri> Cork, the output is an object
[06:33:25] <abailarri> but when I want to see some parts if this objetc, some not works
[06:33:25] <Cork> abailarri: no i should output an array
[06:33:45] <Cork> check over the list of keys in the array
[06:33:48] <Cork> it will be strings
[06:33:59] <Cork> and from that you can get exactly how the key is formed
[06:34:08] <Cork> including weird characters
[06:35:54] <abailarri> Cork, object keys returned me  ["title", "url", "start", "allDay", "className", "pad_id"]. No strange keys
[06:36:18] <Cork> hmm that is weird
[06:36:32] <Cork> abailarri: and these accesses are in the same function?
[06:37:23] <abailarri> I put two console logs in the same function
[06:37:23] <Cork> abailarri: what i was after was something like  "url ", or  " url",
[06:37:29] <Cork> that would have explained the problem
[06:37:33] <abailarri> ya
[06:38:09] <Cork> can you reproduce it in a working code snippet?
[06:38:23] <Cork> can't help more without actually poking at it
[06:39:06] <abailarri> Cork, this is the complet code of the JS
[06:39:07] <abailarri> https://jsfiddle.net/awm10p19/1/
[06:39:43] <Cork> ah
[06:39:53] <Cork> abailarri: the $.ajax call is the answer
[06:40:22] <abailarri> Cork, what do you mean?
[06:40:23] <Cork> abailarri: the value at line 58 is actually set after the code at line 64 runs
[06:40:53] <Cork> so move the code that relies on the url inside the success callback
[06:41:56] <Cork> abailarri: ajax is what's called async, so it the code in the success callback is called when the answer comes back from the server
[06:42:23] <Cork> abailarri: and this can at earliest happen after the current js code has exist (the drop function)
[06:42:58] <abailarri> then, how can I asign the resp.url to the copiedEventObject?
[06:43:15] <Cork> abailarri: just like you are doing, but you can't use it "below" the ajax call
[06:43:27] <Cork> it has to be used inside the success callback function
[06:43:42] <Cork> (as the other code will run before the data is there)
[06:43:52] <abailarri> I understand
[06:43:57] <abailarri> Ok I try
[06:45:23] <abailarri> Cork, yes, that works1
[06:45:25] <abailarri> !
[06:45:34] <abailarri> thank you very much!

[07:44:23] <hcker2000> right now it seems to be running both at the same time even though I have it setup like the example above
[07:45:08] <BillCriswell> fracture_pandeya: There's no ul children of #menu.
[07:45:21] <BillCriswell> no direct ul children*
[07:46:00] <fracture_pandeya> ?
[07:46:08] <fracture_pandeya> there is of li
[07:46:22] <fracture_pandeya> thats what am targetting
[07:47:03] <BillCriswell> fracture_pandeya: #menu is <div id="menu"> with your HTML.
[07:47:18] <fracture_pandeya> jQuery( "#menu > ul > li.menu-item-has-children" )
[07:47:43] <BillCriswell> > means direct children. There's still an element between #menu and ul with your code.
[07:47:50] <fracture_pandeya> hmm ok !
[07:47:52] <fracture_pandeya> got it now yeah

[07:48:06] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[07:53:41] <ne2k> I'd like to use jqueryui slider widget to implement a remote volume control for a headless music player. I could use .change() to only send an event when the control is released, but I'd like to be able to give a little smoother control than that. my concern is that if I fire off an ajax request within .slide(), it will queue bajillions of ajax requests and slow down the whole world. what would be the preferred solution to this?
[07:54:15] <ne2k> should I implement some sort of global lock that prevents more ajax requests being sent if there is an outstanding one?
[07:55:53] <NoiseEee> ne2k: debounce the function so you don't send bajillions of requests
[07:56:31] <ne2k> NoiseEee, that's the kind of thing that I was getting at. I'm just not familiar with how to achieve it. could you point me to an example or some reading?
[07:56:36] <NoiseEee> ne2k: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[07:56:40] <ne2k> NoiseEee, thanks
[07:56:44] <NoiseEee> np ne2k
[07:57:04] <NoiseEee> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ @ ne2k for the initial read
[07:57:41] <ne2k> NoiseEee, I think throttle might actually be more appropriate for this situation
[07:57:48] <ne2k> possibly.
[08:00:07] <ne2k> NoiseEee, looking at that doc, looks like throttle will be perfect. thanks very much!
[08:00:16] <NoiseEee> np ne2k :)
[08:02:02] <ne2k> NoiseEee, so I want slider.slide( $.throttle( 200, ajaxPostVolume ) )
[08:02:37] <ne2k> well actually I need to close over and pass the object to the volume function so it can handle multiple faders, right
[08:03:41] <NoiseEee> ne2k: up to your implementation, but that's the correct syntax iirc ^^
[08:04:21] <ne2k> NoiseEee, ideally I'd be able to dynamically change the throttle rate based on the speed of the connection to the server
[08:04:41] <ne2k> to give greater responsiveness on fast networks
[08:04:58] <ne2k> and prevent too many requests on slow ones
[08:05:35] <NoiseEee> ne2k: imo it should be less about the server and more really about your app; i don't think there's a way to determine the network speed
[08:05:59] <ne2k> NoiseEee, you can surely record the time before and after an ajax call and average over tmie
[08:06:19] <ne2k> NoiseEee, but yeah, let me make something that works first and then think abotu improving it
[08:11:51] <scar> Any idea why bxslider + accordion would cause an issue? i have 1 slide in each tab-- the first tab by default loads fine. when i click the next tab, the slider "disappears" but i can see the next/prev buttons-- what's even more odd is when i right click and hit inspect element ANYWHERE on the page the dev tools pop up and then the slider that was gone then reappears right away
[08:11:56] <scar> so it's like it's jacked up, but only partially lmao
[08:15:22] <maxvi> I have this code http://pastebin.com/hYy1yfZS but visually active is removed after animation is complete
[08:27:26] <adv_> how can i convert js on.click to jquery .click ? there's no e.target anymore
[08:27:39] <robertmaxrees> yes there is.
[08:28:26] <adv_> robertmaxrees: then what is needed?
[08:28:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rp9j4eb5/
[08:29:04] <robertmaxrees> pretty trivial stuff.
[08:29:27] <robertmaxrees> or if you want the shorthand: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rp9j4eb5/1/
[08:34:21] <gh0st11> can someone  tell me what im doing wrong in this simple ajax success callback function: http://pastebin.com/fVtFCkd3
[08:35:46] <robertmaxrees> what's broken about it?
[08:36:40] <adv_> robertmaxrees: what's the difference?
[08:36:54] <robertmaxrees> adv_ the different?
[08:36:59] <robertmaxrees> *between what?
[08:37:06] <adv_> shorthand and the other
[08:37:26] <robertmaxrees> the shorthand calls the .on() one under the hood
[08:41:31] <adv_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/fkkd1u0e/
[08:41:50] <adv_> 'after' doesn't work as 'before'
[08:41:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:41:54] <robertmaxrees> those both use jquery
[08:42:04] <Omar-> what's up adv_
[08:42:48] <Omar-> adv_ "after" will work on first element in DOM, i.e in first page only
[08:43:20] <robertmaxrees> the before has some jank going on.
[08:43:24] <Omar-> "before" you can see "e.target" which represent the page that emits "pagecreate"
[08:43:40] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a complete example.
[08:43:56] <Omar-> robertmaxrees yea. I wrote that code for him before
[08:44:01] <Omar-> so I know it
[08:44:07] <Omar-> I'll try to find it for you
[08:44:11] <robertmaxrees> don't need it.
[08:44:16] <robertmaxrees> i know exactly what's going on :
[08:44:19] <Omar-> unless he made new changes
[08:44:28] <robertmaxrees> there's a parent function calling this to re-bind things.
[08:44:47] <robertmaxrees> really need to use event delegation here instead.
[08:45:00] <robertmaxrees> adv_ either way, both of those examples use jquery.
[08:46:19] <adv_> robertmaxrees: event delegation?
[08:46:26] <Omar-> yea adv_ http://jsfiddle.net/fkkd1u0e/1/
[08:46:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of having to re-bind things, bind a single delegated listener.
[08:46:56] <Omar-> you dont need to wrap it .reayd() nor in pagecreate
[08:47:10] <Omar-> in ready()
[08:47:12] <robertmaxrees> no need for the .one() use in this case.
[08:47:16] <robertmaxrees> just use delegation
[08:47:57] <Omar-> robertmaxrees .on() will add popupafterclose multiple times whenever bar is clicked
[08:48:12] <robertmaxrees> correct, which is why you refactor this to not do that ;)
[08:48:34] <Omar-> you mean move outside click handler, in a separate function?
[08:48:47] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('popupafterclose', '#foo', function() {});
[08:49:14] <robertmaxrees> outside of that click binding, yeah
[08:50:56] <Jocoyl> Hello, Any help adding a div around two existing divs? details http://i.imgur.com/2I1X3W5.png
[08:51:00] <Jocoyl> thanks.
[08:51:51] <Omar-> Jocoyl use wrap()
[08:51:56] <Omar-> !api wrap
[08:51:57] <b-ot> Omar-: .wrap(): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[08:51:57] <robertmaxrees> *wrapAll
[08:51:58] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/wrapall/
[08:52:06] <Omar-> yea wrap all
[08:52:31] <Jocoyl> I looked into wrapAll, but that does not seem to be what i need (it wraps all instances of an element type in its own new whatever-you-specify)
[08:52:43] <Jocoyl> i need to get two different elements into one div
[08:52:50] <robertmaxrees> Jocoyl look at the examples.
[08:52:58] <robertmaxrees> it's exactly what you want.
[08:53:08] <Jocoyl> I'll look again,,,,
[08:54:36] <Jocoyl> Sorry, im not seeing how i can apply wrapAll to my situation. How can I specify two different div ids to be enclosed in one new div?
[08:54:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z2ee31ax/
[08:54:58] <robertmaxrees> by using a selector
[08:55:16] <Jocoyl> ok thank you. I did not know you could select multiple items like that.
[08:55:21] <Jocoyl> thanks for the help
[08:55:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.

[09:05:53] <defuse1> can someone take a quick look at this $.ajax set up and tell me what is wrong with it? http://pastebin.com/fVtFCkd3
[09:06:23] <robertmaxrees> what's broken about it?
[09:07:19] <kostodo> Im have a function that is supposed to add a css class, and then remove that class after a timeout
[09:07:32] <kostodo> What's the right way of going about that?
[09:07:46] <arthurvr> kostodo: lemme fiddle something
[09:07:50] <BillCriswell> kostodo: A timeout.
[09:07:57] <arthurvr> ^
[09:08:04] <BillCriswell> Oh, arthurvr is on it haha
[09:08:08] <kostodo> Tried using setTimeout() inside the addClass callback
[09:08:11] <kostodo> Did not work
[09:08:18] <kostodo> Never seem to get into the addClass callback
[09:08:25] <BillCriswell> defuse1: Look at your network panel and see what's red when  the script runs.
[09:08:39] <Omar-> $(".foo").addClass("bar"); setTimeout(function () { $(".foo").removeClass("bar"); }, 1000);
[09:08:59] <Omar-> kostodo if you're using "this.removeClass()" it wont work
[09:09:05] <Omar-> inside timeout
[09:09:08] <kostodo> Why is that?
[09:09:20] <BillCriswell> this isn't the element in setTimeout, it's window
[09:09:26] <robertmaxrees> because the 'this' object in the timeout is the window obj... ^
[09:09:31] <Omar-> because "this" won't be defined by the time setTimeout is executed
[09:09:45] <robertmaxrees> it IS defined, Omar- - just not what he wants to to be.
[09:09:46] <kostodo> Ah ok of course but why not inside the the callback of addclass?
[09:09:55] <BillCriswell> kostodo: You can do var $foo = $('.foo'); $foo.addClass('bar'); setTimeout(function () { $foo.removeClass('bar'); });
[09:09:59] <Omar-> robertmaxrees yea, what you said :P
[09:10:10] <robertmaxrees> kostodo because it's in another function.
[09:10:12] <BillCriswell> kostodo: Why do you want to remove a class inside a call to something called addClass?
[09:10:16] <defuse1> BillCriswell: Thanks a lot!
[09:10:19] <robertmaxrees> scoping/context.
[09:10:56] <arthurvr> seems like you already have your example. This channel is way to quick :)
[09:12:09] <arthurvr> anyways here you go http://jsbin.com/sohadukuki/1/edit?js,output
[09:12:18] <arthurvr> sorry for the terrible method name :)
[09:13:17] <Omar-> nice one arthurvr ;)
[09:24:10] <Omar-> why using global variables is considered bad practice? or not advisable?
[09:24:40] <arthurvr> Various reasons, actually.
[09:24:44] <robertmaxrees> you can't guarantee somebody else won't use the same names, for one.
[09:24:58] <robertmaxrees> also scope lookups can get expensive if you're not careful.
[09:25:50] <Omar-> so wrapping code in IIFE and define variables at the beginning is better?
[09:26:12] * Omar- hates IIFE because he never got to understand it
[09:26:13] <Omar-> lol
[09:26:22] <arthurvr> not nessecary to do at the beginning, but iife is advisable.
[09:26:25] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[09:26:34] <robertmaxrees> great article on the subject.
[09:26:49] <Omar-> robertmaxrees I've visited that page 10000000 times. everytime I start reading it, I get my brain blocked
[09:26:51] <Omar-> haha
[09:26:54] <robertmaxrees> hah
[09:27:07] <Omar-> arthurvr thanks mate :)
[09:27:15] <Omar-> adv_ read above ^^
[09:27:22] * Omar- slaps adv_ around a bit with a large trout
[09:28:27] <adv_> Omar-: thanks!
[09:28:40] <arthurvr> lol
[09:29:04] <Omar-> adv_ lol
[09:29:37] <arthurvr> Though note that iifes aren‚Äôt always necessary, If all your code is wrapped in a document.ready scope is limited anyways.
[09:29:55] <Omar-> arthurvr yea. but in jQM we use jQM's events
[09:30:08] <Omar-> .ready() is used in rare cases
[09:30:12] <adv_> the problem is i want the same variable visible from pagecreate and document.ready
[09:30:16] <arthurvr> Even then, if everything is wrapped in one function it‚Äôs not needed.
[09:30:17] <Omar-> due to ajax
[09:30:25] <arthurvr> yeah
[09:31:34] <Omar-> adv_ check this http://jsbin.com/yunuhu/edit?js (http://jsbin.com/yunuhu/) I used functions instead of variables to exchange data
[09:31:51] <Omar-> I dont know if my code is correct, but it works fine
[09:37:30] <fracture_pandeya> Hello, I am using fullcalendar, and this is my code, now the thing is that I have hidden the header, and have put a filter for each month, where the user can select the events on monthly basis, but the calendar by default stays in the current month, I know can do it by gotodate, but how ? http://pastebin.com/ZEqamLBc Here is the code
[09:44:09] <ssoen> I saw the talk but am wondering when the new css framework will be released? might have been mentioned but I forgot
[09:45:02] <arthurvr> Development of it is slowly starting now so definitely don't expect it too quick.
[09:45:20] <arthurvr> keep an eye on https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis if you‚Äôre interested
[09:45:38] <fracture_pandeya> arthurvr: you have used fullcalendar before right
[09:45:48] <arthurvr> fracture_pandeya: once
[09:46:00] <fracture_pandeya> jQuery('#calendar').fullCalendar( 'gotoDate', 2015 , 4 ); will this jump the calendar to april 2015
[09:46:11] <ssoen> okay arthurvr
[09:46:13] <fracture_pandeya> i saw it in examples, but it jumps me back to jan 1970 :S
[09:46:17] <ssoen> will keep an eye on the repo
[09:46:33] <arthurvr> fracture_pandeya: no idea
[09:46:56] <robertmaxrees> fracture_pandeya http://fullcalendar.io/docs/current_date/gotoDate/
[09:47:04] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be a moment date object.
[09:47:31] * ssoen leaves
[09:48:08] <fracture_pandeya> yea i know, but what the hell is moment
[09:48:21] <fracture_pandeya> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8174744/how-to-set-full-calendar-to-a-specific-start-date-when-its-initialized-for-the i tried every method here
[09:48:24] <robertmaxrees> http://fullcalendar.io/docs/utilities/Moment/
[09:49:10] <robertmaxrees> the section about creating moments from scratch is especially relevant here.
[09:49:31] <fracture_pandeya> var noTime = $.fullCalendar.moment('2014-05-01');
[09:49:37] <fracture_pandeya> so pass noTime in gotoDate?
[09:49:54] <robertmaxrees> .fullCalendar('gotodate', new moment('2014-05-01')); should work.
[09:51:27] <fracture_pandeya> that doesn't even change anything
[09:51:31] <fracture_pandeya> stays in March 2015
[09:51:45] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[09:52:02] <robertmaxrees> wait .fullCalendar('gotoDate', new moment('2014-05-01'));
[09:52:05] <robertmaxrees> capital D
[09:52:18] <robertmaxrees> if that still doesn't work, fiddle please :)
[09:53:22] <fracture_pandeya> ok yes that did ! thanks !
[09:53:32] <robertmaxrees> cool
[09:53:34] <arthurvr> yeppee
[09:53:45] <arthurvr> by the way, they should really toLowerCase that.
[09:53:51] <robertmaxrees> aye
[09:57:13] <fracture_pandeya> I have stored month in a variable, new moment('2015-' + month + '-01') trying this :/ calendar disappears
[09:59:10] <fracture_pandeya> ok was missing 0
[10:11:30] <Omar-> bye everyone!
[10:11:56] <blenny24_> hi guys, can anyone suggest a jquery validation plugin that shows a tool tip on error ?
[10:12:00] <blenny24_> thx
[10:13:33] <fracture_pandeya> blenny24_> I have used this often > http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[10:14:13] <blenny24_> fracture_pandeya: thx. i already found that. it's very easy to you, can i also display error messages in tool tip form?
[10:14:20] <blenny24_> very easy to use
[10:14:22] <blenny24_> i mean.
[10:24:36] <paulvd> i have a json output which has "-" in the output, however in the frontend it shows the html character of it?
[10:25:15] <paulvd> for example -> This &#8211; Is
[10:36:36] <tbranyen> is it possible to make a local jsonp request with jquery?
[10:36:47] <tbranyen> var getIcons = $.ajax({ url: './weather-icons.js', jsonp: 'callback', dataType: 'jsonp' });
[10:37:05] <tbranyen> for whatever reason jquery is trying to xhr this
[10:40:34] <ngharo> What's the point?
[10:43:04] <blenny24_> i thikn you can't for security reasons. @ tbranyen
[10:43:07] <blenny24_> but i am not sure
[10:48:13] <defuse1> How do I "receive" the data sent from an $.ajax call inside a $.post call? http://pastebin.com/yBUr7Ddf
[10:59:27] <adv_> has anyone used x-editable?
[11:00:26] <adv_> i'm doing an .ajax request and doing .html in an x-editable field. the anchor text (label) doesn't update to the .html() value
[11:05:18] <hcker2000> is there a way to pass in a query param and have a request object in the same method?
[11:14:04] <jeffmjack> kind of a weird question.  in my local environment, all my scripts load fine.  On my server, they don't- 404.  The file structure is the same.
[11:14:56] <jeffmjack> the structure is app/index.html and bower_components/etc
[11:15:17] <jeffmjack> bower components is in root, index.html is in /app/
[11:15:32] <jeffmjack> I'm using relative paths...
[11:28:20] <forQuery> does anyone know how i could rewrite this using an event delegation?
[11:28:21] <forQuery>             $("#selectWidgetGrid_UL").find("a").off().click(function () {
[11:29:03] <NoiseEee> looks like it is using event delgation, unless #selectWidgetGrid isnt there at page load?
[11:31:23] <forQuery> kk, it is :)
[11:31:29] <forQuery> one thing that has always super confused me...
[11:31:39] <forQuery> $("#elMAIN, #elHEADER")
[11:31:44] <forQuery> this selects elHeader and elMain
[11:31:54] <forQuery> but, isnt there way to search only inside of elHeader for elMain?
[11:32:58] <NoiseEee> well those are ID selectors
[11:33:13] <NoiseEee> there's only one of each in the whole doc right?
[11:33:37] <NoiseEee> so its pointless/slow to look for #elMain within #elHeader
[11:36:30] <tirengarfio> Im wondering what is the mechanism to clear only the associated <textarea> when clicking "Clear" http://jsfiddle.net/tirengarfio/45yuuhqx/2/
[11:36:43] <tirengarfio> Please click on the Ziiweb images
[11:36:51] <tirengarfio> then on Clear
[11:40:44] <StanAccy> Ive got small notification icon (a bell) that's currently set as the background image on an anchor tag.  Im trying to add a subtle pulse to the icon to draw some attention to it.  Is there a way to pulse the outline of the image and not the 20x20 square that makes up the sprite?
[12:22:24] <adv_> can i do data-position-to="window" + 100px ?
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably need to use CSS for that.
[12:27:02] <adv_> robertmaxrees: which property?
[12:27:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see, but i'l play around with top or margin-top.
[12:27:33] <robertmaxrees> one of those might work.
[12:27:35] <robertmaxrees> no guarantees though.
[12:28:53] <forQuery> currently, i am assigning an event listener with if (this.checked) {
[12:28:57] <forQuery> but, there are 650
[12:29:02] <forQuery> but, there are 650 this elements on the page.
[12:29:13] <forQuery> does anyone know how i could do this with event delegation?
[12:29:23] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:29:27] <robertmaxrees> can you make a simplified example?
[12:29:30] <coder7of9> i am upgrading jquery. i am curious about the last file listed: i have added: jquery-ui-1.11.4.min.css, jquery-1.11.2.min.js, jquery-ui-1-11.4..min.js. I also have this file left over. ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.23.custom.css  Is it redundant?
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> coder7of9 that's for your customizations.  you might want to get a new version of that, as well?
[12:30:30] <robertmaxrees> it's probably your overrides.
[12:32:00] <coder7of9> there are no overrides i think it is a custom one from the builder so i am curious if it would be a subset of the jquery-ui-1.11.4.min.css
[12:32:23] <robertmaxrees> remove it and see what happens :)
[12:32:26] <coder7of9> does jquery-ui-1.11.4.min.css include everythging i could customize
[12:32:29] <coder7of9> yes i will try
[12:32:31] <coder7of9> thanks
[12:32:52] <robertmaxrees> do not directly edit that jqui css file btw.
[12:33:55] <coder7of9> ok
[12:34:18] <coder7of9> does the builder only subset the jquery-ui-1.11.4.min.css file?
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure i understand what you're asking.
[12:34:37] <coder7of9> that is the question. I will try find out.
[12:36:45] <coder7of9> there is a builder tool which allows the creation of a  custom file. is the content of this custom file always a subset of the full jquery-ui-1.11.4.min.css for example
[12:36:46] <forQuery> I'm having troulbe getting http://pastie.org/10065468 to work with event delegation.  Currently, it adds 600 change events.
[12:37:31] <robertmaxrees> coder7of9 ah.  i'm pretty sure it's just the necessary overrides to keep the file smaller.
[12:37:54] <robertmaxrees> forQuery what does your markup look like?
[12:38:11] <coder7of9> robertmaxrees thanks
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> forQuery because $('ul').on('change', 'li', assignLabelCheckbox); should work fine
[12:42:13] <forQuery> yes, I will try this, thank you robert
[12:42:45] <forQuery>  li.find('input').change(assignLabelCheckbox);
[12:42:51] <forQuery> that is what i had before
[12:49:57] <proteneer> I have a div tag with id =‚Äúfoo_1‚Äù, and it has a bunch of nested children. One of the deeply nested children is an svg
[12:50:14] <proteneer> do I do $(‚Äú#foo_1‚Äù).find(‚Äúsvg‚Äù)?
[12:56:12] <StanAccy> proteneer: Looks reasonable
[12:57:01] <proteneer> StanAccy: thanks - that did seem to work. I have elemSVG = $(‚Äú#foo_1‚Äù).find(‚Äúsvg‚Äù); now I want to serialize out the svg, I tried doing s.serializeToString(elemSVG.get(0));
[12:57:17] <proteneer> but I‚Äôm getting a TypeError
[12:57:20] <StanAccy> serialize out the SVG?
[12:57:23] <proteneer> yeah
[12:57:25] <adv_> how do i convert a js object to json?
[12:57:27] <proteneer> to convert it to a string
[12:57:40] <StanAccy> JSON.stringify( someObj )
[12:57:56] <StanAccy> adv_: but be careful if the object has cyclic dependenices
[12:58:05] <adv_> what are cyclic deps
[12:58:23] <StanAccy> adv_: where an object ends up referencing itself
[13:06:59] <forQuery> so i got the event delegation to work, cut down on 700 event listenrs... but now, instead of being instant when i click a checkbox there is a 1 second delay
[13:07:06] <forQuery>                         $assignLabels_allLabels_UL.on('change', 'input', assignLabelCheckbox);
[13:07:17] <forQuery> is there a way to cache input.  So it doesnt have to look up?
[13:08:49] <adv_> i'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'val' of undefined.  how can i check if it's defined?
[13:09:54] <forQuery> if (typeof(val) === undefined) {
[13:10:13] <forQuery> but its not vali that you want to test
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use typeof cross-browser fwiw
[13:10:15] <forQuery> it's the parent element
[13:10:32] <forQuery> can you share robert, best way.  I have been doing wrong
[13:10:49] <robertmaxrees> if (object != null)
[13:11:02] <forQuery> when you say cross browser, are you talking like ie 8 and below?
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, if (typeof object !== 'undefined')
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> typeof is an operator, not a function.
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> iirc only chrome supports typeof()
[13:11:57] <adv_> robertmaxrees: which is better?
[13:12:00] <adv_> ah
[13:12:07] <forQuery> sweet, thanks robert
[13:12:10] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[13:13:49] <forQuery> li.appendTo('#labels');  can i cache #labels?  So, would $labels = $("#labels");  li.appendTo($labels) be the same thing?
[13:13:59] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:14:17] <adv_> $(this).data().editable.input.$input.val()
[13:14:32] <adv_> so if ($(this).data().editable.input.$input != null ) ?
[13:14:33] <forQuery> :) thx
[13:14:40] <robertmaxrees> adv_ erm.
[13:14:50] <robertmaxrees> that error might be coming from further up the chain.
[13:15:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd figure out why you have cases where things are potentially null/undefined and fix that instead.
[13:16:41] <adv_> robertmaxrees: it was this fortunately
[13:16:42] <adv_> thanks
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd still look at what's causing that in that case.
[13:52:57] <forQuery> google let me down... does anyone know if there is a small speed difference between .css( ) and .css({ })
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> there shouldn't be, nor should you worry about it :)
[13:53:34] <robertmaxrees> i would assume the former would be a little faster, but it'd be so negligible.
[14:03:42] <tfitts> in $.post is there a way to identify whether the response was an error from the server or if no response was ever received?
[14:04:11] <tfitts> I need to determine if the request was bad or if I lost my wifi connection and didn't actually get a response
[14:04:32] <robertmaxrees> one of those is an error code from the server, the other is a timeout.
[14:05:45] <robertmaxrees> this will have some info: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6685217/ajax-checking-for-connection-drops
[14:05:48] <tfitts> got it
[14:05:53] <robertmaxrees> as will this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18201921/923919
[14:10:02] <vacho> I have this line of JS in my HTML page footer... oTable = jQuery('#32VlMzL3').dataTable();  and then I have a javascript.js include..how can I get to the oTable variable from my included JS file?
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> where is that file is it defined?
[14:10:22] <robertmaxrees> is it defined within a function?
[14:11:29] <vacho> robertmaxrees: no it's not.
[14:11:50] <robertmaxrees> if you omitted the var keyword, it's globally available, though that's technically an error.
[14:12:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd do window.oTable = jQuery('#32VlMzL3').dataTable(); to make that explicit, then access window.oTable elsewhere.
[14:12:34] <vacho> robertmaxrees: there is no var keyword.. ReferenceError: oTable is not defined
[14:12:53] <robertmaxrees> it's an error to omit the var keyword.
[14:14:05] <robertmaxrees> unless you're explicitly making it a property on the window object.
[14:14:26] <vacho> robertmaxrees: I am using this with a laravel plugin it generates a random ID on each page load :(
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:14:45] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what i'm telling you.
[14:16:02] <vacho> robertmaxrees: not direclty but I need the ID to run your code
[14:16:14] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[14:16:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm real lost by what your problem is.
[14:16:37] <forQuery> currently I have this catastrophy that adds 600 event listeners to the page.  newLi.click(addSearchLabel);
[14:16:43] <forQuery> i was trying to use event delegation, but this doesnt seem to work
[14:16:44] <forQuery> $parent.on('click', newLi, addSearchLabel);
[14:16:57] <robertmaxrees> forQuery the second arg must be a selector.
[14:17:04] <robertmaxrees> not an object.
[14:17:13] <forQuery> yes, thank you robert
[14:18:42] <robertmaxrees> forQuery ytou're not running that line more than once, right?
[14:19:17] <vacho> robertmaxrees: Sorry I will try to be more clear.. oTable = jQuery('#32VlMzL3').dataTable(); ... that line of JS is run in my HTML footer... and then in my javascript.js include I am trying to reload my datatable using a function called fnReloadAjax() which is a plugin I found here: https://datatables.net/plug-ins/api/fnReloadAjax
[14:19:31] <vacho> robertmaxrees: problem is.when I reference oTable in my JS include it cannot find the object
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> vacho you need to do window.oTable = jQuery('#32VlMzL3').dataTable();
[14:19:57] <robertmaxrees> then anywhere you want to use oTable, you use window.oTable instead.
[14:20:39] <vacho> robertmaxrees: I am getting this then: DataTables warning (table id = 'sYMsaup5'): Cannot reinitialise DataTable.
[14:20:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're trying to reinit something then.  google around.
[14:25:54] <adv_> can i .ajax POST two variables, one in html and one in json?
[14:26:21] <robertmaxrees> sure.  you can post anything in the data object
[14:26:29] <forQuery> i was trying to use event delegation as in this example, http://pastie.org/10065661  but it doesnt seem to work.
[14:27:20] <adv_> robertmaxrees: no i mean both at once
[14:27:39] <adv_> id as html and jsonstr as json
[14:27:44] <adv_> with a single .ajax call
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> forQuery that's really ephemeral.
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> adv_ i have no idea what you mean.  make a fixee or something?
[14:29:36] <forQuery> i love that word :)
[14:29:44] <robertmaxrees> forQuery you're confused about what delegation is for.
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> this code will still bind one listener for every instance of something, it's just moving where that listener is.
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[14:30:09] <forQuery> yes
[14:30:21] <robertmaxrees> move all your logic into the event handler instead.
[14:30:22] <forQuery> because, if i comment out the click enterily, and go to chrome timeline, it loses 700 events on page
[14:30:41] <robertmaxrees> $searchLabels_allLabels_UL.on('click', 'li', addSearchLabel); will still add 700
[14:30:54] <forQuery> yes
[14:31:18] <robertmaxrees> move that outside of the for loop.
[14:31:30] <forQuery> oh
[14:31:33] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it relies on anyhing inside of it.
[14:31:35] <forQuery> well, that's a good idea
[14:34:50] <forQuery> i moved both event delegation listeners to below for loop and it fixed
[14:34:54] <forQuery> thank you robertmaxress
[14:35:05] <robertmaxrees> you should check out the jquery learning center btw.
[14:51:00] <adv_> i'm POSTing this to php http://pastebin.com/5yDtbRC2
[14:51:21] <adv_> there's nothing in $_POST['json2']
[14:51:33] <adv_> not set
[14:51:36] <robertmaxrees> because that's not the name of the var server-side.
[14:51:57] <adv_> so what's the name server side?
[14:52:00] <robertmaxrees> try $_POST['id'] maybe?
[14:52:08] <robertmaxrees> that'll get the ID value.
[14:52:15] <robertmaxrees> i don't use PHP so i'm not entirely sure.
[14:52:30] <robertmaxrees> but this JS doesn't send that name over, just the contents of it.
[14:53:31] <adv_> hm, there's no identifier
[14:53:40] <adv_> tried id , same thing
[14:53:45] <robertmaxrees> you're just lookin for the post body
[14:54:59] <robertmaxrees> i'll guess $_POST contains everything the server gets.
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> couldn't need datatype: "json", in that btw.
[14:56:02] <robertmaxrees> *shouldn't, rather.
[15:15:24] <rubyronin> anyone have any experience with anchor links in jquery mobile?
[15:22:03] <ilhami> adv_, :-D
[16:31:37] <_blizzy_> so I have this ajax going with jquery. after the ajax is done, it adds a class to a div. however, a few seconds later, it removes the class for some reason. https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/550f3844e16db2a22bb2
[16:32:31] <robertmaxrees> nothing in that code would remove that class.
[16:39:36] <_blizzy_> well, for some reason, it's turning yellow for a few seconds, then it reverts.
[16:40:03] <robertmaxrees> then other code is running .removeClass() or something similar, or the element is being replaced.
[16:40:19] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you run that code in your console without the ajax code?
[16:40:25] <robertmaxrees> *the addclass bit, i mean
[16:41:07] <_blizzy_> it stays permanant.
[16:41:11] <_blizzy_> meaning it must be the ajax.
[16:41:25] <robertmaxrees> *meaning something may be listening to ajax events or something similar ;)_
[16:41:31] <robertmaxrees> any ajax event listeners?
[16:42:58] <_blizzy_> I think what is happening is that the page is reloading.
[16:43:19] <_blizzy_> so, I basically need to check when the page loads if in the database there is a favorite for that user and post.
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> why is the page randomly reloading?
[16:43:59] <_blizzy_> well, not even that, I need to check for it anyway.
[16:44:14] <_blizzy_> I'm making a favorite system, so I want the star icon to stay yellow even on refresh.
[16:44:22] <_blizzy_> if it is favorited in the database.
[16:44:29] <robertmaxrees> you should check server-side for that.
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> not client-side.
[17:04:49] <adv_> i need help with x-editable http://pastebin.com/bGEA1biB
[17:05:27] <robertmaxrees> $('a#title').each(function(){ O.o
[17:06:09] <adv_> yes that's wrong
[17:06:11] <duckgoose> why do you have an each block for an ID
[17:06:18] <robertmaxrees> i literally just asked that.
[17:06:25] <duckgoose> don't be a dick
[17:06:35] <robertmaxrees> ... i'm not being one?
[17:06:47] <adv_> it was $('#editform .editable').each(function(){
[17:06:48] <adv_>  and i'm trying to transform it to select a#title
[17:07:08] <adv_> i know i need to drop the .each but what instead?
[17:07:15] <adv_> should i put*
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees>  $('a#title').each(function(){ O.o
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> [2015:03:31:17:05:27] * jop008 (~jopho
[17:07:22] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> $('#title').data().editable.input.$input.val(JSONObject[0]);
[17:07:39] <robertmaxrees> that's all you should need.
[17:07:40] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:08:53] <duckgoose> " and i'm trying to transform it to select a#title" I don't exactly get what you're saying there
[17:13:29] <adv_> well what robertmaxrees said
[17:13:39] <adv_> but that's not enough to change the label
[17:13:54] <adv_> how can i inspect all properties of an object
[17:16:05] <Insentience> so I've learned how to clear out the contents of an html div with jquery. How do I fill it with content through jquery?
[17:16:11] <Insentience> i find it quite confusing to use
[17:16:48] <duckgoose> $("div.whatever").html("your new html");
[17:17:22] <Insentience> wow its that simple
[17:17:24] <Insentience> i feel dumb
[17:17:48] <Insentience> Uh but I would have to escape a lot of characters right? and i imagine that gets tedious with large amounts of html
[17:19:14] <adv_> i want to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20366436/updating-x-editable-input-field-based-on-returned-value but i don't have access to success
[17:20:13] <duckgoose> Insentience you should only use .html for html code
[17:20:22] <duckgoose> if you want to feel a div with text use .text
[17:21:07] <duckgoose> sorry Insentience I read your question wrong
[17:21:19] <duckgoose> yea you have to escape it
[17:21:42] <Insentience> I read that I can just have it pump html from an external file using .load
[17:21:53] <Insentience> that sounds a lot less troublesome :D
[17:22:02] <duckgoose> if it's a local file yes
[17:23:03] <duckgoose> keep in mind .load works asynchronously though
[17:28:29] <TeddyMurray> in jquery mobile im trying to give the body tag a background, but i think jquery mobile is overlapping my attributes
[17:28:36] <TeddyMurray> anyone know how to work around that?
[17:28:54] <Insentience> cannot load file. cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, etc
[17:29:18] <Insentience> $.get("html/settings.html", function(data){		$("div.body").html(data);		});
[17:29:26] <Insentience> that's what i am using
[17:29:28] <Insentience> what is going on
[17:31:54] <duckgoose> Insentience that code should work
[17:32:22] <duckgoose> are you load an html file in your browser from your machine?
[17:32:26] <duckgoose> loading
[17:32:37] <Insentience> "XMLHttpRequest cannot load file. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource."
[17:32:41] <Insentience> yeah from the machine
[17:33:06] <duckgoose> it won't work that way for security reasons
[17:33:21] <Insentience> i see
[17:33:23] <Insentience> any hope?
[17:33:36] <Insentience> or am i just stuck with the silly way of doing things
[17:33:38] <duckgoose> the file is loaded using the file:// scheme rather than http://
[17:33:53] <duckgoose> if you load the page via the http scheme it should work
[17:34:33] <duckgoose> i.e. you need to have it loaded from an actual web server to work
[17:35:49] <Insentience> well that isn't an option right now
[19:36:15] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, I have 2 svgs. Inside of them 3 polygons. I want to match the position of each polygon in each svg. I think I'm close but can't seem to get the second set of polygon points. Anyone care to take a look at this? http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/gbyrvg?editors=101
[19:47:45] <forQuery> neat lost grid animation cory
[19:49:20] <CorySimmons> forQuery: Thanks. Check out the grid. It's pretty badass.
[19:49:59] <forQuery> hehe im there
[19:51:52] <CorySimmons> I've got a few neat projects i've been putting a lot of work into lately. https://github.com/corysimmons/
[19:52:12] <CorySimmons> Working on another open source thing now but can't figure this thing out.. :(
[19:54:28] <forQuery> hmm, no less version of jeet?
[19:55:36] <CorySimmons> forQuery: Nah, I couldn't figure out Less' syntax. I really need to use it non stop until I learn it just so I can port all my libs to it
[19:55:47] <CorySimmons> Would be pretty sweet to offer every flavor of preprocessor
[19:58:25] <forQuery> im building a grid system right now...
[19:58:46] <forQuery> how many lines is scss version, maybe i can port and learn something in process
[20:00:34] <forQuery> oh it's pretty short :) i am going to have look
[20:08:26] <forQuery> let me try to help with your triangles first.  what's your goal, you want left and right svg at http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/gbyrvg?editors=101 to match?
[20:09:07] <forQuery> why not just cut/paste?  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bNJpjY  I think i dont understand what the goal is.
[20:10:59] <CorySimmons> forQuery: Go to http://species-in-pieces.com
[20:11:14] <CorySimmons> You see how you can click on the next species, and the triangles all morph?
[20:11:20] <CorySimmons> That's basically what I'm trying to recreate
[20:12:20] <CorySimmons> I'm just trying to get it working with 2 svgs right now, but it'd be nice to get all svgs in .polyshift to transition between each other
[20:13:19] <CorySimmons> I need to get polygon 1 and polygon 3 to match, as well as polygon 2 and polygon 4.   <svg>polygon 1, polygon 2</svg> <svg>polygon 3, polygon 4</svg>
[20:14:07] <CorySimmons> If I can do that, I can simply add an animate attribute to the polygon that will transition from it's old points to it's new points.
[20:14:16] <CorySimmons> But I just can't figure out how to capture cooresponding points
[20:14:51] <forQuery> oh, i did that before
[20:14:57] <forQuery> with a button using a library
[20:15:03] <forQuery> it rotaes through svgs
[20:15:08] <forQuery> let me find code
[20:15:12] <CorySimmons> awesome
[20:17:37] <forQuery> sigh, mine is behind paywall but here is widget i based it off of
[20:17:39] <forQuery> http://codepen.io/iautomate/pen/zxdaQW
[20:18:10] <forQuery> http://codepen.io/zhouwenbin/pen/vELeKz and this is library demo
[20:26:06] <CorySimmons> Neat, thanks
[20:26:13] <CorySimmons> I actually just figured out my method
[20:47:19] <d3m0n> I want to change the entire inside of an iframe including doctype. Is this possible?
[20:47:34] <d3m0n> I am able to change up to the html element but not sure how to add doctype.
[20:47:59] <d3m0n> $('#preview').contents().find('html').html(doctype + data);
[20:57:02] <forQuery> do you have control of what's on the other end of the iframe
[20:57:06] <forQuery> just add meta tag, right?
[21:02:56] <forQuery> or htaccess
[21:03:14] <forQuery> my problem is, iframe says i dont have meta charset set but i do
[21:51:42] <alexw> I have an input
[21:51:49] <alexw> and when I press down I want to change focus to anothe element
[22:21:46] <forQuery> does anyone know how you can say... if there is ever a console error message, also include the title of the page beside the console message?
[22:31:46] <se_busca_ayuda> forquery: firebug does that
[22:47:08] <forQuery> yes.  I will try that.  thank you se_busca
[22:47:21] <forQuery> in my case, i was trying to build it into system but, that is good personal fix perhaps
[22:56:32] <se_busca_ayuda> forQuery, you mean like wrangling the DOM?
[22:58:35] <doitwithus> hey guys I need some feedback, on new community free DIY helping each other website. Please let me know who can help me?
