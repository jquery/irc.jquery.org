[00:00:18] <djQuery> suzukiz: did you check the docs? did you google for jquery height?
[00:00:22] <djQuery> ?height
[00:00:55] <suzukiz> yeah i did... couldn't find anything and all the info i found i couldn't get it to work
[00:01:05] <djQuery> .html('lotsa stuff here').height()
[00:01:18] <suzukiz> yep tried that... didn't work
[00:01:43] <djQuery> is it visisble at that point otherwise the height is 0
[00:03:14] <suzukiz> yes it is visible the height is 20px because of a 10px padding
[00:04:03] <djQuery> glad I typicly use ui.dialog({modal: true}); my self and let it work it out.
[00:04:45] <suzukiz> after i change the content and i alert .html(data).height() it gives me 0
[00:06:00] <MeetM> how to send data from select option list to php after selection?
[00:06:28] <Hierofant> suzukiz then set and get
[00:08:08] <suzukiz> doesn't setting require me to know the height in advance?
[00:08:27] <djQuery> MeetM: is it in a form? $('select').change(function(e){  $.post('php.php', {val: $(this).val()}  });
[00:08:49] <Hierofant> suzukiz sure, so why don't you?
[00:09:03] <djQuery> MeetM: oh you my want to add a callback there
[00:09:09] <Hierofant> BTW this smells fishy
[00:09:21] <MeetM> ya
[00:09:21] <Hierofant> divs have measurable height
[00:09:36] <Hierofant> you don't have to set it for it to be 0
[00:09:46] <Hierofant> suzukiz - why are you using alert?
[00:09:55] <MeetM> djQuery: let me try
[00:10:03] <Hierofant> that could be the problem
[00:10:14] <Hierofant> before a page re-renders all divs will be 0
[00:10:41] <suzukiz> hierofant: debugging the value
[00:10:54] <Hierofant> you do know the value is screen-based, right?
[00:10:59] <Hierofant> if you didn't set it
[00:11:54] <djQuery> MeetM: stop trying to pm me
[00:12:44] <suzukiz> hierofant: the generic popup div is top part 50px, content part 20px(padding), bottom part 50px... the top and bottom are fixed... the content part changes using .html
[00:13:03] <Hierofant> yeah so stop using alert() to test it
[00:13:48] <coldhead> suzukiz: what happens if you try to get the height of the element using the firebug or chrome inspector console?
[00:14:19] <coldhead> just by entering $('div#modalform_content').height() at the console
[00:14:23] <coldhead> once it's loaded
[00:14:31] <suzukiz> even without the alert the popup sits in the browser as the height was unchanged
[00:15:24] <juha___> MORNING
[00:15:37] <coldhead> g'day juha___
[00:17:34] <juha___> coldhead: you calling me gay?
[00:17:51] <JKarsrud1> good morning boys and girls :)
[00:18:12] <coldhead> no, this is how i do that: juha___, i believe you prefer the intimate company of men
[00:19:40] <Hierofant> He won't remember that.  Coping strategy.
[00:20:12] <djQuery> coldhead: so that means he doesnt like u?
[00:20:19] <juha___> coldhead: that's also true, you sexy bastard
[00:20:32] <coldhead> no one likes me
[00:21:11] <royboy777> coldhead: i like you, you saved my day!
[00:21:24] <juha___> coldhead: i hate you
[00:21:28] <royboy777> lol
[00:21:29] <coldhead> lol
[00:21:43] <coldhead> it will fade
[00:21:44] <coldhead> everything falls apart
[00:21:44] <coldhead> the center cannot hold
[00:21:55] <Hierofant> unless you're a galaxy
[00:22:10] <nauthiz> suzukiz: have you tried to catch the resize-event on your document?
[00:22:18] <djQuery> Hierofant: then it colapses in upon itself
[00:22:28] <nauthiz> i recalc the size of my workview everytime the window getsresized
[00:22:30] <coldhead> thermodynamics: there is no escape
[00:23:03] <Hierofant> djcoin not necessarily
[00:23:08] <Hierofant> djQuery
[00:23:18] <juha___> eventually we will all die and our lifes are meaningless
[00:23:46] <coldhead> my life is already meaningless
[00:23:48] <coldhead> i can't wait to die
[00:23:52] <djcoin> :)
[00:24:08] <djcoin> No, lets make the future better
[00:24:18] <coldhead> meh what's the point
[00:24:36] <JKarsrud1> excellent question
[00:24:41] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_law_of_thermodynamics
[00:24:43] <djcoin> So you give joy to any one
[00:25:08] <suzukiz> nauthiz: when i resize the page it correctly centers the popup
[00:25:18] <djQuery> coldhead: is that you dont talk about the law of thermodynamics
[00:25:38] <coldhead> i can give a child the greatest joy imaginable and a century from now it won't have made any difference
[00:25:49] <coldhead> i gave my love a chicken, that had no bone
[00:26:07] <snover> it will make a difference once the police get their hands on the child
[00:26:13] <coldhead> <333
[00:26:27] <suzukiz> i suppose it's not registering the new .html content that i'm changing
[00:26:33] <coldhead> this is why you have to weight the corpse
[00:26:53] <coldhead> suzukiz: it shouldn't be giving you 0
[00:26:55] <djQuery> acid
[00:26:58] <coldhead> maybe your selector is wrong?
[00:27:05] <coldhead> creepy, djQuery
[00:27:08] <coldhead> and with you a parent
[00:27:11] * coldhead tut tuts
[00:27:18] <djQuery> any else watching breaking bad?
[00:28:17] <smurfke> was just looking it up, seems to be a new top show
[00:28:30] <djQuery> its pretty good
[00:28:45] <coldhead> suzukiz: try alert ($('div#modalform_content').length);
[00:28:50] <djQuery> the stuff u learn
[00:29:08] <suzukiz> i don't think my selectors are wrong because when i resize the browser it correctly adjust the popup
[00:29:16] <djQuery> like dont disolve a body in acid in the 2nd floor bathtub
[00:29:20] <Hierofant> humans might not die out for a long time, and may have a legacy.
[00:29:41] <smurfke> lol
[00:30:01] <Hierofant> suzukiz good, but you still aren't using the right method to get the var
[00:30:32] <suzukiz> alert($('div#modalform_content').length) = 1
[00:31:04] <smurfke> on the 1ste floor would be better?
[00:31:04] <djQuery> suzukiz: why not just $('modalform_content').html('whatver').dialog({modal: true});
[00:31:05] <juha___> instead of making the future better, let's just make the beer better
[00:32:04] <Hierofant> juha___ one and the same, bro
[00:32:24] <suzukiz> weird thing is if i send an alert the popup is adjusted correctly too... comment out an alert the popup sits toward the bottom of the browser
[00:32:31] <Hierofant> why not just console.log()?
[00:32:57] <coldhead> why not indeed
[00:32:59] <Hierofant> suzukiz not if it needs to re-render the stage, it's not weird
[00:33:13] <Hierofant> coldhead you're letting this happen, aren't you
[00:33:22] <Hierofant> he must suck
[00:33:24] <coldhead> entropy?
[00:33:29] <coldhead> i can't fight entropy
[00:33:31] <Hierofant> yes, him
[00:33:35] <coldhead> that's why i use heroin
[00:33:46] <Hierofant> of course you can.  That's what most life does, fight entropy.
[00:33:56] <coldhead> entropy will win
[00:33:56] <Hierofant> but it creates waste elsewhere
[00:34:06] <Hierofant> of course, unless life transcends
[00:34:29] <coldhead> here's a more pressing concern: NO SIMPSONS EPISODES ON TV TONIGHT
[00:34:49] <styol> booo
[00:34:50] <coldhead> no i don't know what is biting suzukiz
[00:35:07] <djQuery> coldhead: course not tonight is monday
[00:37:50] <coldhead> it's very sad
[00:39:21] <UglyBOB> Hi, when you use the html() function to set html in a certain div, does it refresh if the new html is the same as the html that's already there?
[00:40:02] <JKarsrud1> UglyBOB: yes
[00:40:19] <UglyBOB> ok
[00:40:29] <suzukiz> not sure what to fix but here's the code if ya'll are able to assist http://pastie.org/pastes/2127717
[00:41:15] <UglyBOB> JKarsrud1: is there also a way to set the html without entering it in .html() ? (so retreiving the current html and putting it back)
[00:41:43] <JKarsrud1> depends on what it is you want to do, tho
[00:41:56] <JKarsrud1> do you want to read it, append something, and put it back?
[00:42:16] <djQuery> suzukiz: u can fix that it is not a working example. try jsbin or jsfiddle instead
[00:42:16] <JKarsrud1> if all you want to do is append some new html to it, you can just use .append()
[00:42:25] <UglyBOB> the contents of the div are dynamic... So i cannot put it between .html() ... It has to be retreived from the DOM
[00:42:39] <UglyBOB> no, no need to append something
[00:43:41] <JKarsrud1> UglyBOB: hm, what exactly do you want to do=
[00:43:42] <JKarsrud1> ?
[00:43:52] <UglyBOB> refresh a div...
[00:43:58] <UglyBOB> without changing the html
[00:44:01] <djQuery> $(modal_name).fadeIn(2000,
[00:44:18] <djQuery> I asked earlier if it was visible and you said yes.
[00:45:02] <suzukiz> it is that's not the complete code... it's part of the code that i'm having problems with
[00:45:10] <djQuery> if its not visiable u cant get the height
[00:47:46] <suzukiz> var modal_name = "#modal"; // id of the parent div
[00:49:59] <djQuery> var modcont =$('div#modalform_content').dialog({moda: true, show: false}); $('a[name=modal]').click(function(e) { modcont.load(this.href, function(){ modcont.dialog('show');});
[00:50:11] <djQuery> there all done suzukiz.
[00:50:37] <muzone> Good morning / afternoon y'all
[00:50:39] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?02K - why do the dropdown menus flicker 1px to the left once you hover off the main links?
[00:51:25] <Nuck> Can somebody help me with sending data as multipart via jQuery's AJAX?
[00:51:36] <djQuery> muzone: actualy they dont show at all
[00:52:04] <timing> here they show, but I have no clue what you mean by flickering ( chrome )
[00:52:07] <muzone> djQuery: what browser / OS you on?
[00:52:12] <Nuck> I *can* do a PUT, but the problem is getting thr form data into the aja
[00:52:29] <djQuery> chrome
[00:52:44] <timing> muzone: now I see what you mean!
[00:53:16] <muzone> djQuery: works fine here! (you realize the working example is at the bottom right? for just the example see http://www.webdevout.net/test?02K&raw)
[00:53:46] <djQuery> muzone: yeah you have to scroll forever then click the disply button
[00:53:54] <muzone> wait, my friend from #css fixed it http://www.webdevout.net/test?09
[00:54:04] <timing> muzone: on the hover, do you add a border and minimize the padding?
[00:56:03] <djQuery> that one shows
[00:57:02] <muzone> timing: do now, yeah
[00:57:08] <muzone> props to oksushi
[00:57:27] <djQuery> suzukiz: nothing to say about that? it requires jqueryui though
[00:57:48] <djQuery> and I misspelt modal of course
[01:00:13] <suzukiz> :( thank for all that helped
[01:02:38] <Chibby_> does anyone know of a jqueryui plugin for tooltips that supports themeroller?
[01:03:02] <Chibby_> i've trawled through about 20 different ones with no luck so far s:
[01:14:15] <Superman_> how to bookmark us?
[01:14:27] <Superman_> any ideas ..
[01:15:05] <lazyPower> djQuery: for grins you should start responding with IE5 / OSX
[01:18:53] <kephu> anyone here use jsTree? I have a question regading that
[01:19:00] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?02T&raw - how does my dropdown match up against the one at www.topshop.com in terms of code quality, cross-browser compatibility and general accessibility / usability?
[01:19:46] <Etu> Heya, posted jquery question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6490175/span-as-input-with-jquery-ui-autocomplete

[01:31:05] <UglyBOB> hi, I'm trying refresh a div, this is what i have: http://pastebin.com/Q2tmuFSK
[01:31:11] <UglyBOB> is this the correct way?
[01:31:35] <aaronmcadam> checking now
[01:31:57] <UglyBOB> ty
[01:32:37] <aaronmcadam> ok, it can take a function
[01:33:00] <aaronmcadam> try .html() instead of html on line 7 UglyBOB
[01:33:14] <UglyBOB> oh right
[01:33:27] <UglyBOB> so it's correct otherwise?
[01:33:34] <UglyBOB> it will refresh the div?
[01:33:34] <aaronmcadam> var currenthtml = $(this).html();
[01:33:45] <aaronmcadam> try it on jsfiddle
[01:33:53] <aaronmcadam> ?paste @ UglyBOB
[01:34:05] <aaronmcadam> ?jsfiddle @ UglyBOB
[01:34:09] <aaronmcadam> ?jsfiddle @UglyBOB
[01:34:12] <aaronmcadam> hah
[01:34:23] <Etu> Dead bot?:)
[01:34:26] <UglyBOB> lol
[01:34:28] <sean`> beetlejuice
[01:34:30] <UglyBOB> i found it
[01:34:32] <aaronmcadam> cool
[01:34:34] <sean`> beetlejuice
[01:34:40] <aaronmcadam> beetlejuice!
[01:34:40] <Etu> aaronmcadam: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6490175/span-as-input-with-jquery-ui-autocomplete any idea about this?
[01:34:47] <sean`> orangejuice
[01:35:32] <UglyBOB> aaron, i use the name selector here, because it applies to multiple divs. will this code reload all divs with their own content?
[01:35:47] <aaronmcadam> how will that degrade tho Etu
[01:36:11] <aaronmcadam> do up an exampel on jsfiddle UglyBOB then we'll see
[01:36:15] <aaronmcadam> example*
[01:36:33] <Etu> aaronmcadam: hm? degrade?
[01:37:13] <aaronmcadam> ?progressive
[01:37:27] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 1+1
[01:37:40] <aaronmcadam> ?eval(1+1)
[01:37:50] <sean`> HAHA
[01:37:52] <aaronmcadam> bot's not workinnnn
[01:37:55] <sean`> It's possiblen't
[01:37:58] <sean`> The bot liven't
[01:38:01] <Etu> ?help
[01:38:13] <sean`> Etu, what do you want?
[01:38:42] <aaronmcadam> Etu can you get it working with just inputs first?
[01:38:48] <Etu> sean`: I have spans as inputfields, becose they autosize in the with and such things
[01:38:56] <sean`> okay
[01:38:57] <sean`> koole
[01:39:09] <Etu> sean`: And I want to be able to use autocomplete on my spans :P
[01:39:23] <sean`> you need to hack it
[01:39:39] <Etu> aaronmcadam: I had it working... In a old revision of my code, somewhere.
[01:39:51] <aaronmcadam> i think you should make it work with actual inputs first
[01:40:13] <aaronmcadam> and so it still works without js too
[01:40:28] <aaronmcadam> then change the attrs on the inputs to hidden in your js
[01:40:34] <aaronmcadam> and then try it
[01:40:40] <Etu> This system requires js to work, and its not a public system
[01:40:42] <aaronmcadam> build it from working first
[01:40:43] <Etu> So its okay
[01:41:02] <aaronmcadam> it's easier to build something from a working base though
[01:41:03] <Chibby_> if anyone else was hoping for an answer, i found what i want: http://pines.sourceforge.net/pnotify/ (themeroller supported tooltips and notices)
[01:41:06] <Chibby_> and it's done really well!
[01:43:36] <makinen> how can I check if a selector points at a textarea?
[01:44:31] <aaronmcadam> firebug console.log
[01:45:26] <gnarf> console.log, or breakpoint and just inspect the contents of the selector on the console itself
[01:45:37] <gnarf> ?ftj @makinen
[01:45:39] <coldhead> if ( $('#something').is('textarea') )
[01:45:49] <coldhead> heya gnarf <3
[01:45:53] <gnarf> coldhead with the literal
[01:45:57] <coldhead> fiing those jqueries
[01:46:03] <coldhead> ixi*
[01:46:16] <gnarf> coldhead: not tonight....
[01:46:26] <coldhead> is ixi just x in roman numerals?
[01:46:29] <coldhead> i think so
[01:46:38] <aaronmcadam> 'fiing'.replace('ii','ixi');
[01:46:51] <coldhead> thanks aaronmcadam
[01:46:54] <aaronmcadam> hehe :P
[01:46:58] <coldhead> you are the sultan of my loins
[01:47:13] <gnarf> ixi wouldn't happen in roman numerals
[01:47:14] <aaronmcadam> damn, living the dream
[01:47:26] <coldhead> yeah but what if it did
[01:47:49] <gnarf> coldhead: they'd tell the guy who etched it into the stone slab he was a retard
[01:47:59] <gnarf> and used 2 to many characters
[01:49:07] <coldhead> too*
[01:49:21] <coldhead> see but like what if he was carving
[01:49:29] <coldhead> and he was gonna write 9
[01:49:31] <coldhead> IX
[01:49:32] <gnarf> or rather II too many
[01:49:45] <coldhead> but then his boss is like OH DOOD THAT SHOULD BE 10
[01:49:55] <coldhead> TOTES SOZ LOL
[01:50:04] <coldhead> then the thinking stonemason would just IXI that shit
[01:51:05] <coldhead> unfortunately my only historian contacts are egyptologists
[01:51:16] <coldhead> and can't be trusted
[01:52:48] <Superman_> hothead
[01:54:22] <anli_> Is there a way to have a left padding on the first column of a table using css only?
[01:54:30] <anli_> eh, right padding, it should be
[01:54:58] <levu> anli_: table > tr > td:first-child {...}
[01:55:24] <UglyBOB> when using .EACH on a set of divs in jquery, how can the current div be retrieved inside the loop? I use $(this).html() - but this returns the html of the clicked element instead of the html of the div
[01:55:54] <aaronmcadam> UglyBOB, please use jsfiddle
[01:56:34] <UglyBOB> but i don't have all images and several external js files
[01:56:46] <aaronmcadam> just put a simple bit of html there
[01:56:51] <anli_> levu: thanks!
[01:56:53] <UglyBOB> ok
[01:57:00] <aaronmcadam> it's simple
[01:57:07] <Anomareh> does anything in .animate force scrollbars? I've gone so far as to set overflow: hidden in my reset yet when I shrink something's height via .animate I get scrollbars during the animation, though they go away after it ends
[01:57:13] <aaronmcadam> just paste in some jquery that you thought should have worked
[01:57:24] <aaronmcadam> you can include js files if u want
[01:58:19] <coldhead> you can include your dreams
[01:58:24] <Superman_> ..
[01:58:26] <aaronmcadam> true
[01:58:34] <Anomareh> another oddity it only happens if I trigger the shrink right after the grow, if I wait a second or 2 I don't get scrollbars
[01:58:37] <coldhead> AND HE DID. THE END.
[01:58:52] <Anomareh> I've checked the value of overflow just before the shrink and it's set to hidden
[01:59:48] <levu> Anomareh: make the animation very slow (e.g. 10s) and look with firebug, which css property of which element changes
[02:00:02] <coldhead> good thinking levu!
[02:00:02] <aaronmcadam> ?eval $( '#bot' ).is( 'working') ?
[02:00:19] <Anomareh> levu: that's the craziest thing I have, and they ALL have overflow hidden, yet I STILL get scrollbars
[02:00:22] <Anomareh> it's driving me nuts
[02:00:33] <coldhead> aaronmcadam: Max timeout exceeded.
[02:00:48] <aaronmcadam> has somebody switched it off?
[02:00:55] <aaronmcadam> +Ccnt
[02:01:02] <levu> Anomareh: do they still have overflow: hidden while animation? or maybe parents or children don't have overflow: hidden
[02:01:04] <coldhead> no, looks like his server is offline
[02:01:11] <coldhead> bot-t.com
[02:01:32] <coldhead> but he shall rise again!
[02:01:50] <Anomareh> levu: I'll check again, but there's nothing in my script at that point changing it, and I've gone so far as to set overflow: hidden in my reset
[02:02:24] <aaronmcadam> ?get well soon buddy!
[02:02:51] <Anomareh> levu: bleh, animate is setting overflow to auto, any idea why?
[02:05:27] <gnarf> Anomareh: it should set it back to what it was
[02:05:37] <gnarf> Anomareh: what version of jquery?
[02:05:46] <gnarf> and can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle.net ?
[02:06:41] <aaronmcadam> i think everybody should be forced to read an intro to jsfiddle on this before asking a bloody question
[02:06:43] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:10:56] <Anomareh> gnarf: 1.6.1, I set it to hidden before .animating it, .animate is setting it to auto during the animation for some reason which is causing the scrollbars, then sets it back to hidden at the end
[02:11:27] <Anomareh> I could try reproducing it in jsfiddle but what I'm working with is rather elaborate and annoying
[02:13:18] <aaronmcadam> Anomareh, it's much easier for people to help you though if you try to set up an example on jsfiddle
[02:13:59] <Anomareh> aaronmcadam: I know and I have in the past, but what I'm working with it's not as easy as just pasting some code or tossing something together quick
[02:14:07] <Anomareh> I know what the issue is, I just don't know how to fix it
[02:14:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah I hear you
[02:14:21] <aaronmcadam> been there before
[02:14:36] <aaronmcadam> problem is if we can't replicate your issue it's very hard to debug
[02:14:38] <Anomareh> .animate is setting the overflow of the element to auto while animating and it's causing scrollbars to be shown
[02:15:02] <Anomareh> well I'm guessing this is expected behavior? as gnarf said '
[02:15:09] <Anomareh> 'it should set it back to what it was'
[02:15:13] <aaronmcadam> could be covering something
[02:15:28] <Anomareh> which it does, and it hides them at the end of the anim
[02:15:32] <Anomareh> it's just I get them during the anim
[02:16:04] <aaronmcadam> i bet it's in the easing
[02:17:25] <aaronmcadam> Note: if attempting to animate an element with a height or width of 0px, where contents of the element are visible due to overflow, jQuery may clip this overflow during animation. By fixing the dimensions of the original element being hidden however, it is possible to ensure that the animation runs smoothly. A clearfix can be used to automatically fix the dimensions of your main element without the need to set this ma
[02:17:25] <aaronmcadam> nually.
[02:17:57] <Trudko> guys if i have row if id myRow how to find inputfied which is inside of that row and have id my Inpout?
[02:18:04] <aaronmcadam> Anomareh, http://api.jquery.com/animate/#step ?
[02:18:54] <aaronmcadam> wow
[02:19:21] <Anomareh> aaronmcadam: using that to set overflow to hidden at every step seems like a bad idea :s
[02:19:22] <aaronmcadam> you want to get the id of the selected input Trudko
[02:19:25] <Anomareh> though I suppose if it works
[02:19:52] <aaronmcadam> Anomareh, I'm just reading the docs just an embryo thought :p
[02:20:49] <gnarf> Anomareh: it should be setting overflow: hidden during animation
[02:20:50] <aaronmcadam> Anomareh, have you inspected the easing functions?
[02:21:22] <Trudko> aaronmcadam: yea you are right so then different question my problem is ...
[02:21:29] <Trudko>  I  have trhee fields with three lables in table in one row(in 6 td). What I need to do is take last\company name field( http://imageshack.us/f/32/testfl.jpg/) and make change it to larger field  and change label as here :  http://imageshack.us/f/32/testfl.jpg/
[02:21:44] <Trudko> second row shoul trun to third row and Company name has to have same name attribute as last\company name. This will change according to value of dropdown and not sure about best waz to do that.
[02:22:34] <Trudko> and I can either move Last Name field change it label to Company name, resize and  add colspan(have to do this) or I was thinking about creating/delete rows
[02:22:50] <ejo> Argh... I've got a div that needs to have 'position: absolute' before and during a certain animation, but needs to have 'position: fixed' after the animation.  Otherwise its behavior in case the user resizes the window is all wrong.  Sorry, not asking for help, just grumbling out loud
[02:22:52] <Trudko> one row element for second row and one for third row
[02:23:39] <Anomareh> gnarf: it's not, and the animate call is the only thing happening in my code when it's being getting set to auto, and it's set to hidden directly before it
[02:24:09] <gnarf> Anomareh: what version?
[02:24:39] <aaronmcadam> ejo, unfortunately i think animated elements need to be pos:abs
[02:24:50] <Anomareh> gnarf: 1.6.1
[02:25:01] <ejo> well the animation works with fixed, but it has a side effect i don't want.
[02:25:03] <aaronmcadam> can't you set it pos:fixed after animation is finished
[02:25:24] <ejo> I can, but it's so weird to change the 'position' property like that
[02:26:14] <aaronmcadam> does it work if you do
[02:26:29] <ejo> That's what I'm trying next.  If I don't run out of steam for the night first!
[02:28:03] <ejo> It's one of those deals where you have some tabs along the right edge of the window, and they slide out when clicked.  The place they need to slide to is defined based on the left edge of the window.  But their home location is based on the right edge of the window.  That's why this is taking extra work.  Woulda been pretty simple otherwise.
[02:28:19] <ejo> Sorry for complaining, if I were asking for help I'd post example code etc. but I'm just bellyaching
[02:28:28] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.6.1/src/effects.js#L173-207
[02:28:34] <gnarf> thats where it sets the overflow to hidden
[02:28:59] <aaronmcadam> hmm cool gnarf
[02:29:03] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: and unless you can get a reproducable scenario on jsfiddle.net I can't help much more
[02:29:17] <aaronmcadam> gnarf, exactly what I told the guy
[02:29:55] <gnarf> sorry, sometimes hard to figure whos problem it is here
[02:30:01] <gnarf> point the advice at the right "guy" ?
[02:30:22] <aaronmcadam> Anomareh, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.6.1/src/effects.js#L173-207
[02:33:09] <Anomareh> gnarf, aaronmcadam: I have no idea how to even start to go about trying to get this on jsfiddle :/
[02:33:37] <aaronmcadam> Anomareh, you can include external scripts
[02:33:42] <gnarf> Anomareh: start with a div, style it the same, and then animate it
[02:33:50] <gnarf> the idea is to reproduce your issue
[02:33:59] <gnarf> pull one piece of your code over at a time
[02:34:06] <gnarf> and get the same problem to happen
[02:34:12] <gnarf> if you can't then you haven't found the problem
[02:34:23] <gnarf> when you can you might be able to find your workaround
[02:34:41] <Anomareh> gnarf: I know, it's just a very elaborate animation sequence and setup
[02:34:45] <aaronmcadam> otherwise we can speculate about possible problems all day
[02:35:03] <aaronmcadam> maybe that's where your problem lies then Anomareh
[02:35:04] <gnarf> Anomareh: which sounds like its going to be more likely the cause of the issue than anything in jQuery itself :)
[02:35:42] <Anomareh> gnarf: what's leading me to believe it's jquery, is I set overflow to hidden LITERALLY the line before the animation
[02:35:42] <aaronmcadam> very  often problems occur on here when people make assumptions about the API or are doing things wrong in other places
[02:36:07] <Anomareh> I swapped the animation to a very slow duration, and I watch it starts as hidden, then swaps to auto during the animation, then back to hidden at the end
[02:36:18] <Anomareh> no where in my code am I setting it to auto
[02:36:19] <mello> hi, i added a custom attribute "value" to a div (normally a div doesn't have a value attr) for use in my application. Since updating to jQ 1.6, the selector doesn't work anymore... http://jsfiddle.net/7zNVS/6/
[02:36:20] <gnarf> Anomareh: i need to see the problem to reproduce the problem, and I don't want to see the problem in the middle of your code
[02:36:29] <Anomareh> gnarf: I know
[02:36:48] <thomedy> okay my night is aobut over but i got to get this last thing
[02:36:51] <aaronmcadam> mello, use data-value
[02:37:06] <aaronmcadam> data- should probably be used for any custom attrs
[02:37:10] <nodie> hi
[02:37:17] <thomedy> i run a content management system... so things get done a bit faster until i find somehting i dont' like and then i have to go find the div or variable yada yada yad
[02:37:24] <thomedy> such is this time
[02:37:32] <nodie> how can I "remove" a :nth-child() css style with jquery?
[02:37:44] <mello> aaronmcadam interesting. it doesn't want to pick it up because it's not an actual existing attribute that is defined in the dom?
[02:37:48] <thomedy> i am adding some buttons and functionality to one of my pages
[02:37:56] <aaronmcadam> mello dunno
[02:37:59] <thomedy> and i cant find out what 'this.' is referring to o
[02:38:05] <nodie> I've a table where I want to change the background color based on a click on a checkbox, but this table uses :nth-child() to use alternate background colors
[02:38:06] <thomedy> so...
[02:38:13] <gnarf> mello: probably because "value" is an attribute in the dom
[02:38:14] <mello> aaronmcadam well thanks. i'll try that now
[02:38:17] <gnarf> but only valid on inputs
[02:38:27] <thomedy> is there a way to do an event with if rather than $().click
[02:38:36] <nodie> so now I can change the color of the even rows  with .css() but I can't with the odd rows
[02:38:39] <thomedy> or onclick="function()"
[02:38:39] <mello> aaronmcadam it indeed picks up data-value
[02:38:40] <mello> thanks
[02:38:45] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:38:53] <_ramo> hi
[02:38:56] <thomedy> i just need an if statement that will allow me to keep my this value
[02:39:03] <_ramo> is it possible to check if a string like: '<p><i>Abstract</i></p>' is on a page?
[02:39:05] <thomedy> cuz i cant figure out the doc's on it
[02:41:01] <Edler> If anyone wants to check it out there's an online presentation about web security and it has a javascript clickjacking example check YourWebSecurity.com (It's HTML5, use chrome :P)
[02:41:53] <thomedy> does anyone know how to detect clicks specifically with if()
[02:42:07] <aaronmcadam> mello, use a data- prefix for any other custom attrs
[02:43:29] <aaronmcadam> it's a html5 thing mello
[02:43:42] <gnarf> thomedy: you can't detect events with if()
[02:43:46] <gnarf> you bind to the event
[02:43:56] <thomedy> dang i was afraid of that
[02:43:57] <gnarf> and the function is called when it happens
[02:44:03] <gnarf> so
[02:44:06] <gnarf> having said that
[02:44:16] <thomedy> yeah i kind of figured i just cant figure out the variable im looking for in my cms
[02:44:17] <gnarf> why are you trying to "detect a click" or perhaps reword what you said
[02:44:20] <aaronmcadam> mello, so you could return your attr like this $("div").data("value");
[02:44:23] <thomedy> thats my only problem
[02:44:54] <thomedy> i would usually just jquery it up and problem solved
[02:45:00] <gnarf> aaronmcadam / mello: one caveat- use lower case only, and avoid hyphens
[02:45:07] <gnarf> there is some weirdness in the spec for those
[02:45:09] <aaronmcadam> detect an event with an if statement? tf?
[02:45:20] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know that gnarf
[02:45:22] <thomedy> well i run a content management
[02:45:30] <aaronmcadam> don't think mello's noticed my msgs anyway hah
[02:45:35] <thomedy> so certaing things are done for me
[02:45:47] <thomedy> which is faster but confusing when i try to modify
[02:45:54] <thomedy> case in point
[02:46:20] <thomedy> they are using an extensive amount of 'this' and i can t figure out the root this cuz its difined more than once
[02:46:31] <thomedy> so when i bind something to it i looz my this
[02:47:09] <gnarf> thomedy: store "this" in a variable in the private scope
[02:47:23] <thomedy> i cant run this to it anymore i might be able figure somethign out
[02:47:38] <thomedy> no if it was my code (which i prefer) then it would be much easier
[02:47:50] <aaronmcadam> uh
[02:47:51] <gnarf> .click( function( e ) { var elem = this; setTimeout(function() { console.log( this, elem ); }, 100); })
[02:51:32] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?02T&raw - how does my dropdown match up against the one at www.topshop.com in terms of code quality, cross-browser compatibility and general accessibility / usability?
[02:52:03] <thomedy> i wonder if there is a way to stub out 'this' or if its connected to something annoying let me see what i cand o
[02:52:07] <aaronmcadam> i don't understand people using code that they're unable to edit
[02:52:42] <PrinceES> I am looking for a script in which i can give my home banner look like as ... http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[02:52:56] <thomedy> well... its just me... it actually makes sense to get the work done faster to use a cms
[02:52:58] <aaronmcadam> you can't "stub out" this, it must be being used for a reason
[02:53:00] <thomedy> it does to me anyway
[02:53:05] <mello> aaronmcadam sorry i was answering an email concerning this. Using data-value just worked fine! but thanks for the update
[02:53:15] <thomedy> when i say stub out i just mean print its meaning
[02:53:17] <aaronmcadam> no probs mello
[02:53:29] <aaronmcadam> oh just log it out then
[02:53:29] <thomedy> its a word ive used for a long time just to describe testing
[02:53:38] <thomedy> is that the console.log
[02:53:39] <aaronmcadam> right well to me stub out means destory
[02:53:46] <aaronmcadam> destroy*
[02:53:49] <mello> gnarf: do you mean that data-value is also a bad idea to use? or am i missing your point
[02:53:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah thomedy
[02:54:05] <thomedy> i have more experience with strict langusages and am learning this web stuff nown
[02:54:05] <aaronmcadam> mello no there's just rules to remember
[02:54:17] <aaronmcadam> mello, must be lowercase and must be data- as prefix
[02:54:31] <mello> aaronmcadam ah okay! thanks, now i'm updated with that too ;)
[02:54:34] <aaronmcadam> if you're using the jquery data method to retrieve the value
[02:55:03] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:55:17] <aaronmcadam> strict languages heheeee
[02:55:29] <thomedy> c++ and what not
[02:55:34] <thomedy> i dont' know what to call them
[02:55:42] <aaronmcadam> i kno what u mean
[02:55:48] <aaronmcadam> strongly versus weakly typed langs
[02:56:20] <thomedy> yeah sorry if i come acrross rude at all tonight its late andmy keyboard is really pissingme off
[02:56:21] <aaronmcadam> i'd recommend learning js properly though
[02:56:44] <thomedy> iv been on a mad dash to learn it all... i just taught myself sql
[02:56:44] <aaronmcadam> rather than leaning on a cms and trying to hack it
[02:56:48] <thomedy> and alot of php
[02:56:57] <thomedy> and the basics of javascript
[02:57:20] <thomedy> and alot of jquery in the last i don't know 2 months or so.. usually around 10 at night to 4 in the morning
[02:57:27] <thomedy> its just one thing at a time or 4
[02:58:01] <aaronmcadam> seems like you're pushing yourself like mad
[02:58:16] <thomedy> yeah i actaully am
[02:58:22] <aaronmcadam> are you a student?
[02:58:34] <thomedy> yi was... last semester
[02:58:43] <max_> someone help please, http://pastebin.com/3Dizi6vT how can i add all the values up?
[02:58:50] <thomedy> im married and am about to have a second kid and am tired of living on the margin
[02:58:56] <thomedy> and the only thing that fixes that is work
[02:58:57] <aaronmcadam> ahh right
[02:59:00] <thomedy> so thast what im doing
[02:59:19] <thomedy> im a bit stressed out

[03:00:01] <aaronmcadam> parseInt( $(el).text(), 10 )
[03:00:03] <max_> i need to add all values if the select is yes
[03:00:14] <max_> i have 2 select
[03:00:19] <thomedy> well its not so much my code which usually works fine
[03:00:21] <aaronmcadam> you have to parse the string to a number to add it
[03:00:30] <thomedy> i am having a hard time with the contentmanagement i run
[03:00:54] <thomedy> cuz for the most part its well documented ... in this very specific instance and veryspecific upgrad i am adding its crap
[03:01:17] <max_> aaronmcadam: can u help me pastebin it?
[03:01:21] <thomedy> i cant find the meaning of this variabla im in
[03:01:36] <aaronmcadam> max_, use jsfiddle
[03:01:53] <aaronmcadam> thomedy, dude, use console.log( this )
[03:02:03] <thomedy> thats what im doing right now
[03:02:04] <aaronmcadam> and it will print in the firebug console
[03:02:09] <max_> http://jsfiddle.net/jS6aG/
[03:02:17] <aaronmcadam> or in chrome/safari, web inspector
[03:02:40] <aaronmcadam> max_ u forgot the html....
[03:04:17] <max_> http://jsfiddle.net/jS6aG/1/
[03:04:18] <thomedy> wait now where do i look in firebug to find my .log()
[03:04:23] <aaronmcadam> console
[03:04:31] <thomedy> yeah im in there
[03:04:46] <aaronmcadam> refresh
[03:04:49] <thomedy> i think thast just lazyness from being tired im sorry i l find it
[03:05:18] <max_> aaronmcadam: any sample of adding different select values together?
[03:05:25] <aaronmcadam> jesus that's mental
[03:05:38] <aaronmcadam> max_ i don't have time to decipher that haha
[03:05:44] <max_> haha no problem
[03:05:59] <aaronmcadam> just put up a simple example
[03:06:12] <max_> any quick tip for adding all values on like 4 selects?
[03:06:13] <aaronmcadam> why are u redefining the same variable
[03:06:17] <crashev> I want to select text with mouse and then after clicking some link want to copy it to for example textarea - what is the proper way to do that ?
[03:06:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[03:06:37] <thomedy> me aaronmcadam
[03:06:38] <thomedy> ?
[03:06:46] <max_> used for different select.
[03:06:54] <thomedy> if it was me?... im trying not to redefine it
[03:06:59] <aaronmcadam> max_, ( +$(select).val() )  + ( +$(select2).val() )
[03:07:14] <aaronmcadam> no, I'm talking to max_ thomedy
[03:07:20] <thomedy> got it
[03:07:31] <amcsi_work> hello
[03:07:38] <max_> thanks aaronmcadam:
[03:07:40] <amcsi_work> how do I check if an image is loaded in a cross-browser way?
[03:07:54] <aaronmcadam> max_ the + operator will convert a string to a number
[03:08:08] <amcsi_work> I almost thought checking its height() would work, but it fails, because while the image isn't loaded, the alt text pops up
[03:08:09] <max_> thanks
[03:13:21] <aaronmcadam> amcsi_work, image.load() might work
[03:14:17] <amcsi_work> not in IE
[03:14:23] <amcsi_work> if it caches
[03:14:59] <aaronmcadam> what happens if you bind to window.load
[03:15:41] <amcsi_work> I could do that if nothing else works, but I'm trying to find a faster way
[03:17:14] <Trudko> Guys I have this field http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/32/testfl.jpg/. There is party classification dropdown
[03:17:27] <Trudko> if there is non idividual value then third row with Company name should appear

[03:17:46] <Trudko> Thing is Last Name and Comapany name should be same field - field with same name question is how to do that?
[03:18:25] <Trudko> I can either move the field add colspan to td, resize it  and hide first and midle name and then undo it

[03:58:08] <Aamir> Nuck:  ask question, dont look for experts
[03:58:18] <Hui_Nan> Amir, everything works fine, except for the reposition not happens at all
[03:58:48] <Nuck> Aamir: It's regarding PUT and the x-multipart encoding.  I'm wondering how to upload a file with ajax?
[03:58:50] <Hui_Nan> setting css left and top does not change position() result
[04:00:00] <Nuck> I just need something that'll provide a simple function to send off a form as x-multipart (and, if possible, provide progress updates)
[04:00:45] <bjensen> when you use bind, does it then also work for new elements that are loaded in using ajax?
[04:00:56] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @bjensen
[04:01:01] <aaronmcadam> ?test
[04:01:07] <Edler> bjensen:no it doesn't
[04:01:19] <aaronmcadam> bjensen use delegate()
[04:01:19] <Edler> use .delegate
[04:02:13] <Trudko> Guys cant get it work pls look here http://jsfiddle.net/SUGy9/
[04:02:22] <Trudko>  I want to switch third row with second row if some condidtion is true
[04:03:17] <aquatix> did jsfiddle uppercase your tags?
[04:03:22] * aquatix misses some "-s too
[04:05:03] <Edler> Trudko: HTML tags are ALWAYS lowercase
[04:05:59] <Aamir> Trudko:  something like http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/SUGy9/1/
[04:08:13] <Trudko> aamir whats that doing? rows should appear be removed(not just hide) depending on value in dropdown
[04:08:28] <Trudko> Edler true and what I did wrong
[04:08:39] <bjensen> if I were to use delegates then shouldnt this simple example work? $("body").delegate("a.spinner_enabled", "click", function() { console.log("foooooooooo"); })
[04:08:40] <bjensen>  body exists but the a.spinner doesnt yet
[04:08:40] <Trudko> Edler: I mean upper case wont produce my problem
[04:10:13] <RobinJ> 		$('.menu ul li a').click << can anyone tell me why this selector doesn't seem to be working? http://robinj.be/
[04:10:32] <RobinJ> i'm new to jquery, but if i'm not mistaken the sleectors should be the same as  they are in CSS
[04:10:41] <aquatix> Trudko: maybe the missing "-s cause problems
[04:10:58] <Trudko> aquatix: no it does not
[04:11:00] <Aamir> RobinJ:  yes you are right
[04:11:03] <aquatix> k
[04:11:16] <RobinJ> then i dont really see why this isnt working xd
[04:11:19] * aquatix doesn't have time to dive deeper in the problem though :(
[04:11:28] <Trudko> nevermind :/
[04:11:43] <Trudko> Aamir: hm?
[04:11:43] <RobinJ> maybe it doesnt execute the script becauise it wants to navigate to the <a href> thing
[04:11:44] <RobinJ> ?
[04:11:52] <bjensen> nm works
[04:11:53] <bjensen> thanks
[04:14:01] <Aamir> RobinJ:  because your $('.menu ul li a') is outside document.ready :)
[04:14:51] <Nuck> Ugh
[04:15:08] <Nuck> I really can't believe it's this hard to upload a damn file :S
[04:15:37] <RobinJ> huh... sghpoud,nt it be? xD
[04:15:54] <Aamir> Nuck:  http://webdeveloperplus.com/jquery/ajax-multiple-file-upload-form-using-jquery/
[04:16:10] <RobinJ> should it be inside the document.ready or inside the document.ready function()?
[04:16:23] <Aamir> or http://www.tutorialchip.com/jquery/9-powerful-jquery-file-upload-plugins/
[04:16:25] <VictorCL2> hellow
[04:16:55] <Aamir> RobinJ:  $(document).ready(function(){  //yourcode })  or simply  $(function(){//yourcode})
[04:16:58] <Nuck> Aamir: Oh thanks... Hopefully these ones aren't the bloated pieces of crap I've seen so far :S
[04:17:39] <VictorCL2> how can check if there is a div with class "event" inside td of table, but I need to filter the index like   ... check if inside td from 100 til 145 there is a div with class "event"
[04:18:14] <Cork> VictorCL2: $('td div.event').size > 0
[04:18:15] <RobinJ> great, now it's stuck on a loading box xD
[04:18:27] <VictorCL2> $table.finde("td .event").slice(100,145)
[04:18:34] <VictorCL2> something like that?
[04:18:40] <Trudko> Aamir: or maybe just think I want to remove and append second and third row according  to value of some dropdown
[04:18:55] <Cork> VictorCL2: no that won't work
[04:19:19] <Cork> you would have to select the div based on the .event and then get its parent
[04:19:53] <VictorCL2> if the parent is a <td> .. can I know on which tr and td is it?
[04:20:44] <Cork> VictorCL2: $td.parent().index()
[04:20:45] <RobinJ> urk
[04:20:56] <RobinJ> now get my index.php inside my index.php
[04:20:57] <RobinJ> xD
[04:21:14] <Cork> VictorCL2: the tr holds the index of the rows, if thats what your looking for
[04:21:23] <RobinJ> keeps fading in and out... oh HELP xD
[04:24:02] <VictorCL2> ok , I get it ,, but can I filter like .. if I have a table with 100 cols or td  .. then I need to check if on cols between 80 til 90 there is a div with class "event"
[04:24:21] <Anomareh> when doing: $('.some-element').siblings('div').hide() is there anyway to only run the callback once after all the animations are done?
[04:26:15] <Cork> VictorCL2: ya, on the tr row, select .event  check its parents index
[04:26:29] <bjensen> how can I see which events are availeble in my session? I have this: $("body").delegate("a.spinner_enabled", "ajax:loading", function() { console.log("foooooooooo"); })
[04:26:29] <bjensen>  which dosnt work, but if I replace ajax:loading with click then it works..
[04:26:42] <Cork> VictorCL2: the closest you can get is :containes
[04:27:00] <Cork> ?:contains
[04:27:08] <Cork> bah..
[04:27:50] <Cork> VictorCL2: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[04:28:18] <Cork> VictorCL2: but if you posibly can set a class on the td/tr your interested in, you will save quite a lot of speed in your app
[04:29:29] <VictorCL2> ok will check , thanks
[04:30:49] <slartsa> hm, ui-draggable is apparently committed to those elements that are statically created but how about if I create those elements dynamically?
[04:31:41] <Trudko> guys I want to append and remove second OR third row depeneding on value of some variable. I will do it in listener and I need to remove one and add second and vice versa. html code http://jsfiddle.net/vbDSU/
[04:32:05] <Cork> slartsa: as long as you give them the correct classes, it should work fine
[04:32:22] <Cork> if i remember correctly it binds through .deligate so
[04:32:27] <slartsa> Cork: it doesn't
[04:33:22] <Trudko> I have tried this but nothing has happened v
[04:33:23] <Trudko> http://jsfiddle.net/SUGy9/2/
[04:33:53] <thomasp`-> test
[04:34:12] <slartsa> Cork: in source I can see that those that are statically created are now also showing position details, but those that are dynamically created show me none
[04:35:43] <thomasp`-> What is the correct way to add an on click callback to an element that was dynamically appended?
[04:36:24] <Cork> Trudko: i'm not sure what your code is trying to do, its incomplete
[04:36:53] <Putr> hey ppl :) so i have jquery inclouded (1.4.2) in the html file.. but $ is not defined for some reason. Any ideas?
[04:37:19] <zec-> thomasp`-, http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:37:20] <Cork> Putr: does the page fail to load the file?
[04:37:23] <Trudko> Cork ou, as I said I have dropdown and if lets say value X is choosen there second row should appear and third row sould be removed and if value Y is choose second row should  be removed and third should appear
[04:37:38] <Cork> Putr: or does it load another framework like prototype?
[04:37:52] <thomasp`-> thx zec-
[04:38:05] <Putr> Cork: no firebug shows the file as loaded
[04:38:08] <Cork> Trudko: try to make a working example in jsfiddle, it makes it simpler to look at it
[04:38:19] <Cork> Putr: and other framework?
[04:38:32] <Trudko> Cork? I cant get it work thats the problem
[04:38:36] <Putr> Cork: this is a part of a larger aplication, where jquery worked b4. Didnt try anyother framework (never used it)
[04:38:49] <Cork> Trudko: the code you pasted is incomplete, so theres no way to get it to work
[04:39:17] <Cork> Trudko: your giving a few lines without its context. ex what is individualInputRow and nonindividualInputRow?
[04:39:21] <Trudko> Cork how its not complete? you have table with three rows. Row 1 will stay no matter what and second and third should be switched.
[04:40:18] <Trudko> Cork ou ok individualInputRow  is id of first row(will added it there) and  nonindividualInputRow is second w8
[04:41:04] <Trudko> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/SUGy9/3/ updated
[04:41:18] <bjensen> if I trigger my own event using element.trigger('ajax:complete', [xhr, stat]), can I then put a delegate for example: $("body").delegate("a.spinner_enabled", "ajax:complete", function() { console.log("foooooooooo"); })
[04:41:18] <bjensen>  and it should work?
[04:43:49] <Trudko> Cork is it complete now?
[04:46:50] <Putr> This sux.
[04:46:53] <Putr> :)
[04:46:58] <Cork> Trudko: no, its still not posible to say what the js is meant to do
[04:47:07] <Cork> or what its intented to do
[04:47:18] <Trudko> Cork ok ignore that JS its wrong anyway.
[04:47:23] <Cork> ah
[04:47:24] <Cork> wait
[04:47:27] <Cork> now i see
[04:47:59] <Trudko> Cork: ok sorry for not making it clearer
[04:51:06] <Edler> guys if i forgot my password on Nickserv
[04:51:09] <Edler> how can i reset it ?
[04:52:12] <Trudko> Edler:  google irc reset password
[04:53:54] <Cork> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/SUGy9/6/
[04:55:06] <Trudko> Cork hmm and I would like to also add row when one is deleted,
[04:55:30] <Trudko> so one gets removed and other get shown btw I dont need timeout do I?
[04:55:33] <Cork> Trudko: your sure you want detatch?
[04:55:44] <Trudko> I think so
[04:55:52] <Cork> Trudko: the timeout is just to make it flash in the different modes
[04:56:03] <Cork> Trudko: you plan to attach it anywhere else?
[04:56:12] <Trudko> I mean problem is that Last Name Input Field and Company name field do have same ID and Name(they are same field)
[04:56:12] <Cork> else .remove is what you want
[04:56:15] <Cork> or just .hide
[04:56:44] <Trudko> Cork Yes As I said I will have dropdown and depending on which value is there second or third row will appear
[04:57:05] <Trudko> Cork it has to be remove
[04:57:30] <Trudko> whats wrong with detach? according to doc. detach is good if I intend to restore element which I want
[04:57:33] <Cork> Trudko: ugg that sucks
[04:57:52] <Cork> Trudko: ya, but for what you want its over complicated
[04:58:03] <Cork> if the backend would work correctly that is
[04:58:06] <Trudko> So? what should I do?
[04:58:29] <Cork> i would keep one copy of fields that has the same name
[04:58:35] <Trudko> it has to be done on front end.
[04:58:41] <Cork> then change the style of the page through classes
[04:58:51] <Trudko> where would you keep them?
[04:58:57] <Cork> i wouldn't
[04:59:13] <Cork> as i said, one copy of each <input name="">
[04:59:29] <Trudko> can you show it to me?
[04:59:33] <Cork> and move them around and show hide them  through css
[04:59:53] <Trudko> Cork wow seems like more work especiallz because I need to do this for IE6
[04:59:57] <Cork> i don't have the time, the structure has to be changed
[05:00:21] <Cork> Trudko: shoulnd't affect it that much actually
[05:00:45] <Trudko> Cork see structure can be so adding removing element seems more easy
[05:01:09] <Cork> Trudko: well your making it hard for you, but go ahead
[05:01:23] <Trudko> but how is that a problem?
[05:01:45] <Cork> cause you would have to store the extra rows in the js
[05:01:49] <Cork> cause its not valid html
[05:17:56] <nVee> can I ask jquery mobile questions here as well?
[05:17:59] <nVee> wait
[05:18:00] <nVee> sorry
[05:18:00] <nVee> nvm
[05:22:38] <plovs> jquery newbie here, made a simple slideshow that works fine, ut links open only if i open them in a new tab (on chrome), not if i just click on them, i use the cycle plugin
[05:23:05] <Krambfhase> is you page live?
[05:23:25] <plovs> partly here: http://50.22.195.188/~hme010/hme.nl/export/
[05:24:16] <Trudko> Cork and how is save invalid html element problem ?
[05:24:27] <xec> may i ask where the slideshow is?
[05:24:58] <plovs> xec: my slideshow? http://50.22.195.188/~hme010/hme.nl/export/
[05:25:14] <Cork> Trudko: you can have as many form fields with the same name as you like, but they each have to have its own id
[05:25:16] <sadmicrowave> if thats the case its not working in firefox either
[05:25:20] <xec> yes, i was visiting that page and dont see any slideshow :P
[05:25:31] <sadmicrowave> if thats the case its not working in firefox either (the slideshow that is)
[05:25:56] <plovs> xec: sorry it is the big box, the slides are just sloooooow 8secs
[05:26:05] <Trudko> Cork ok lol thats is solving my problem rather easily :D
[05:26:16] <xec> oh, sadmicrowave is right, doesnt work in firefox
[05:26:21] <sadmicrowave> @plovs - I've been sitting on the page since you posted the link, the 'big box' has not moved
[05:26:43] <plovs> sadmicrowave: i will rename myself to sadplovs soon ....
[05:26:58] <xec> in chrome the picture changes at least :D
[05:27:08] <Kambfhase> Canvas is ok, beam me up scotty!  << :D
[05:27:08] <sadmicrowave> plovs - ok, will that help you solve your issue?
[05:27:40] <xec> firefox doesnt like the left menu popup thingys either
[05:27:42] <plovs> xec: i use chrome and safari until i start testing cross-platform .... sigh
[05:27:48] <sadmicrowave> @xec very true
[05:28:15] <slartsa> http://tyoton.com/tyoton/pdffi/jquery-test.htm# could someone please tell me why those four statically created elements are draggable but dynamically created elements are not?
[05:28:23] <sadmicrowave> yes, cross-platform, every developers nightmare, even more so when referring to IE
[05:29:08] <sadmicrowave> @slartsa - I havn't looked at your code or the page but my first question would be, have you used the 'live()' function to make those elements draggable?
[05:29:09] <xec> ive just been working on a site for the last 2 hrs, and first now opened it in ie8
[05:29:27] <sadmicrowave> @xec, very sad?
[05:29:27] <xec> needless to say im going to take a break to cry and whine to random people on irc
[05:29:35] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[05:29:51] <slartsa> oh, bummer
[05:29:53] <plovs> xec: yeah let's do that!
[05:30:02] <Kambfhase> slartsa: you need to call .draggable for the new elements
[05:30:27] <plovs> hmm clicking works in FF, just not the rotating and showing text .... back to the drawing board
[05:31:07] <sadmicrowave> @plovs or the slideshow
[05:32:05] * plovs is going to have a huge cup of coffee and some sugery things
[05:32:23] * dr0id is going to snatch the coffee cup from plov
[05:32:51] <sadmicrowave> @slartsa - you should only call $(document).ready() 1 time and put all your functions within that
[05:33:00] * xec intervenes but spills coffe on everyone
[05:33:01] <Kambfhase> instant human, just add coffee
[05:33:04] * plovs which goes to show that this is a very hard day
[05:33:33] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: thanks for the advice
[05:33:38] <sadmicrowave> @slartsa - also, since you have a class of 'elements' for all your textboxes why not just call resizable and draggable 1 time for each?
[05:33:46] <sadmicrowave> i mean one time period
[05:34:44] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: to answer your question: because I lack the skills to do so :)
[05:34:57] <sadmicrowave> :) let me show you hold on
[05:35:07] <orl> Hi!
[05:35:31] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: alright
[05:35:42] <orl> How can I make an mouseleave event check if it has been followed by a mouseenter one?
[05:36:12] <quip> sadmicrowave I thought that calling $(functionRef) multiple times would just queue up all the functions and run them sequentially
[05:36:22] <orl> I have a dt with a mouseleave event which I don't want to trigger when the following dd is 'mousentered'
[05:36:52] <orl> in other words, I'd like that when the user moves its mouse from dt to dd, nothing happens
[05:37:54] <sadmicrowave> @slartsa - http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/vVy7J/1/
[05:38:58] <Krambfhase> orl: i'll look something up!
[05:39:09] <orl> Krambfhase: thanks
[05:40:23] <Krambfhase> orl: there is a relatedTarget property on the event object. check if that is you dd. http://api.jquery.com/event.relatedTarget/
[05:40:43] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: oh you mean that. I simply didn't want all of the elements to be resizable
[05:41:14] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: of course your method would mean less code!
[05:41:18] <orl> Krambfhase: OK, nice. Got to see what I can do with this, but this looks interesting!
[05:41:24] <orl> brb to says if it works or not!
[05:41:29] <Krambfhase> :)
[05:43:01] <sadmicrowave> slartsa - if thats the case you can also put all the #id's in 1 selector so your not calling resizable and draggable so many times...hold on let me show you
[05:44:16] <nVee> hey guys. Anyone here used jquery mobile before?
[05:44:44] <sadmicrowave> @slartsa - http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/vVy7J/2/
[05:45:40] <Saadi> can someone help me refactor this jQuery code: http://pastebin.com/0QkgdCpc
[05:46:05] <lessless> people, is it possible to add a link to the background image ?
[05:46:19] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: ok thanks :) so what it comes to live() I should just simply put ".live("click", function() instead of just click?
[05:46:24] <lessless> background-image: url('/img/dn18.png');background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right;
[05:46:29] <slartsa> oops, missed a quote
[05:46:54] <orl> Krambfhase: seems suitable
[05:47:06] <orl> just got to find a way to check the following event (string comparison, I suppose)
[05:47:21] <sadmicrowave> @slartsa - I'm working on it now, hold on
[05:47:43] <plovs> right! now the slideshow slides in FF (there was a bug in my js somewhere, but i removed it all except the slideshow), still not clickable, though
[05:47:48] <plovs> http://50.22.195.188/~hme010/hme.nl/innovatie/
[05:49:21] <jomofcw> Hello =) !
[05:51:40] <orl> Krambfhase: sorry I begin with jQuery, where can I find the other (let's say) attributes like "nodeName" and so on?
[05:51:55] <orl> I mean the list of 'members' of that object
[05:54:35] <orl> I might ask the thing in a different way: how can I get the nodeName#id instead of nodeName only?
[05:56:18] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, are you wanting to number all your .elements the same way or have an incremental counter for each type of element you add?
[05:57:58] <orl> OK, found it element.id
[05:58:02] <Kambfhase> orl: event.relatedTarget.nodeName
[06:00:00] <Heliodor1> This is making me mad, how do i match the 3 first characters with regexp?
[06:00:04] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: well the numbering is there just for recognizing purposes. I only need to be able to write something to each of the elements to save it to database
[06:00:27] <sadmicrowave> oh ok
[06:01:02] <AdvoWork> if ive got <input type="text" data-name="" id="test" name="test"> how can i assign data-name a value?
[06:02:55] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, also if you notice, when you add a textarea the 'X' remove link is not showing up either
[06:03:12] <Kambfhase> Heliodor1: /^abc/ << matches a string starting with abc
[06:03:17] <zangetsu> hello
[06:03:35] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: did you try .attr() ?
[06:04:58] <zangetsu> if i use $('#content').dialog() jqueryui create a dialog with #content as dialog body. When i destroy the dialog, how i can do restore in original position  #content?
[06:05:12] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: yeah I noticed, don't really know why that happens though
[06:05:19] <sadmicrowave> ok
[06:06:10] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, like .attr('data-name) ? can i do .attr('myid data-name') ?
[06:07:20] <Kambfhase> .attr('myid data-name')  << whats that supposed to do?
[06:08:33] <Cork> AdvoWork: you can just do .data('name') instead of attr('data-name')
[06:09:36] <Kambfhase> that doesnt set the attribute in the html tough. amirite?
[06:09:46] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, also, I don't think your a#remove function needs to remove the div:first in the parent...doing that, if I click remove for textarea number 6 then textarea number 1 will be removed when actually I want number 6 removed....does that make sense?
[06:10:10] <sublimenal> Hi there, i was wondering if anyone knew of a plugin that would auto scroll a div depending on the direction the user moves their mouse (up or down)
[06:10:38] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, oh wait, I think I see what your doing, it just needs to be tweaked...
[06:14:51] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: well I don't really know why I built it like so, my tendancy was only to be able to remove the parent dic
[06:14:54] <slartsa> div
[06:15:09] <sadmicrowave> no its ok, I understand what you are trying to do
[06:17:30] <zangetsu> if i use $('#content').dialog() jqueryui create a dialog with #content as dialog body. When i destroy the dialog, how i can do restore in original position  #content?
[06:18:37] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, try this out (I was only interested in fixing a couple items, specifically the stuff you asked about, so I deleted the rest ). http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/vVy7J/3/
[06:19:47] <Kambfhase> zangetsu: i see two options here: either cache the original position and restore menually or, clone the #content and show that as a dialog
[06:20:31] <vidarw> Hi! is there any jquery event hooked up to the window.location variable?
[06:20:34] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: that's all what was needed? :)
[06:21:02] <Cork> vidarw: no, location isn't an element so it doesn't have events
[06:21:26] <vidarw> Cork: Any other way to get notified when the url changes?
[06:21:29] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, indeed, you just needed to call .resizable() and .draggable() after the creation of those elements. Also, creating the elements in node format like I did is much cleaner (in my opinion) and allows you to act upon each element individually
[06:21:31] <Kambfhase> there is a hashchange event though
[06:21:46] <Cork> vidarw: beforeunload
[06:22:02] <Cork> vidarw: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[06:22:13] <vidarw> Cork: Thanks

[06:24:24] <Layke> What's some good sliders which I can use with just content? I don't want images.
[06:24:28] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: ok so I just do to the same for checkbox, radio and input what you did to textarea?
[06:24:30] <Layke> Seems all I can find are image carousels.
[06:24:46] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, yessir
[06:27:31] <Jon47> Layke - I looked around for the same thing once, I ended up deciding that the reason you can't find any good ones are because it's just so simple to roll your own.  If you want cool stuff like gesture interaction and "snap-to" then I'd suggest checking out iScroll
[06:27:33] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: dude, you're a lifesaver
[06:28:35] <Jon47> if you make a layout something like.. div.shim > ul.overflowHidden > li + li + li, it just plugs right in
[06:28:50] <Layke> Jon47: It's I'm just trying to do a "News Flash" kind of horizontal bar.
[06:29:09] <zangetsu> tnx Kambfhase
[06:29:18] <Layke> I can format the actual page titles any way I want, I would just like them to scroll at intervals of a few seconds. Maybe slide out to the left and replace each other.
[06:29:20] <Kambfhase> :)
[06:30:01] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, let me know if you have any other issues
[06:30:08] <Jon47> Layke, yeah the above format should work for ya
[06:30:47] <Jon47> using my markup, just make "div.shim" the same width as each of the "li" items, and give the "ul" a really wide width, enough to accomodate all the items it contains without wrapping lines
[06:31:10] <Jon47> then when you "scroll" it, just adjust the margin-left of the "ul" element
[06:31:26] <Jon47> and.. .shim means overflow: hidden, in case that wasn't clear ;)
[06:32:38] <kborchers> Layke: This may work for you - http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html  Just rip out what you don't need and then write a quick function that runs on dom ready that slides the content and then calls itself with a delay using setTimout. Something like that

[06:34:58] <Bittarman> kurisu, I'm afraid your essay was cut short by the character limit.
[06:35:32] <kurisu> Bittarman: ah right... sorry, where did it get up to?
[06:35:50] <VictorCL2> if I have  <div class="main"><div class="child"></div></div>  .. which is the fastest way to select the "child"
[06:36:09] <sukima> $(".child")
[06:36:14] <VictorCL2> $main.find("div.child") ... or ... $main.children().eq(0) ...
[06:36:15] <Bittarman> kurisu, just put it in a pastebin :)
[06:36:26] <Bittarman> thats way too much text for IRC :)
[06:36:51] <kurisu> Bittarman: ok sure... the question ended up being a bit longer than I had anticipated
[06:37:10] <sukima> $(".main > .child")
[06:38:12] <kurisu> Bittarman: http://pastebin.com/tdp9MnGi
[06:38:17] <kborchers> VictorCL2: sukima's first response is the fastest way. if you must find child from main, $(".main").children(".child") is actually a little faster than sukima's second answer
[06:39:01] <sukima> kborchers: Thanks I just learned something. :)
[06:39:08] <kborchers> np
[06:39:20] <Kambfhase> $(".main").children(".child") is actually a little faster than sukima's second answer << sure?
[06:39:40] <kurisu> looking for some advice about jquery effects applied to dynamic content (i.e. unique id's)  ---> http://pastebin.com/tdp9MnGi
[06:40:22] <Jon47> selectors are parsed from right to left, so if oyu do
[06:40:22] <Jon47> $(".main > .child")
[06:40:22] <Jon47> the engine will search the DOM for all elements that have class "child" and then remove the ones that do not have a direct ancestor with class "main"
[06:40:59] <Kambfhase> still
[06:41:02] <kborchers> Kambfhase: yeah, actually saw a jsPerf not to long ago that showed that
[06:41:03] <Jon47> the selector you go with depends on the rest of your DOM, if you have other elements with ".child" that are outside of ".main", then you will need to go with the .find method
[06:41:32] <Kambfhase> kborchers: got the link?
[06:41:35] <Jon47> if you only have ".child" elements in ".main" it's probably fastest to just select $('.child') and forget about .main altogether
[06:43:03] <kborchers> Kambfhase: http://jsperf.com/jq-use-children-c-ass-vs-class-selector
[06:43:13] <Kambfhase> Jon47: $(".main > .child")  will be passed though to QSA but $(".main").children(".child") will not. So lets check out the jsperf
[06:43:54] <b1lly> i'm trying to create a json object cookie, which i'm using the jquery cookie plugin. is there an easy way to append / update this cookie? because its supposed to the state of the user and it needs to get updated after every action that a user takes, incase of a browser crash
[06:45:04] <Jon47> jsperf is great but remember it's just a tool - make sure the sample corresponds pretty closely to the actual DOM you're working with or you might get results that don't apply to you
[06:45:20] <sukima> kurisu: Have you looked at jquery-ui accordion? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[06:47:22] <_thomb_> i just found the jquery ui draggable objects. is it possible to move serveral objects at the same time? I'm looking forward to build something like a google maps overview
[06:47:50] <kborchers> Jon47: agreed. your situation will definitely change the outcome of those tests. i was just stating that at their simpelest, one was slightly faster than the other. in most cases, it probably won't make a difference which one you use since they are very close in speed.
[06:49:03] <kurisu> sukima: I have seen that but not really suitable for my needs, just need a way to generate/parse unique id's of divs
[06:50:56] <sukima> kurisu: I am having difficulty understanding the question. Is it possible to put the DOM your working with in http://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[06:52:25] <b1lly> is there a way to remove a parent element, but not the  elements within it? content within
[06:52:40] <kborchers> _thomb_: NO, that is not possible with draggable and won't be: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4901 Check out this plugin though, it might help - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/multidraggable
[06:52:58] <Saadi> is there a way to count elements?
[06:53:32] <quip> b1lly, like this? http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[06:53:32] <b1lly> .length
[06:53:46] <b1lly> thx quip
[06:53:58] <_thomb_> kborchers: uh nice one, thank you
[06:55:16] <FxIII> hi all
[06:56:38] <deuterium> hia. how do i access the "api" variable as shown on this page? http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/docs.html#api_docs
[06:59:19] <kurisu> sukima: the styles a bit messed up but the important stuff is all there, here --> http://jsfiddle.net/zQZYS/
[06:59:31] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: now that I've had your attention I'm just going to brutally take advantaged of you.. Did I miss something because just about nothing works?
[06:59:49] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: ..on my server I mean
[06:59:55] <sadmicrowave> lol give me a few minutes.
[07:00:24] <kborchers> deuterium: exactly as the examples on that page use it? maybe i'm not understanding your question.
[07:01:28] <kurisu> sukima: ** + except the jquery library include
[07:03:25] <deuterium> kborchers: that 'api' variable doesn't seem to be available. is this a default jquery mechanism or is this 'api' var provided by supersized?
[07:03:57] <kborchers> deuterium: that is a plugin and only available via that plugin. that is not a jquery mechanism
[07:04:19] <deuterium> kborchers: ok thanks. i'll investigate in this direction.
[07:07:22] <sukima> kurisu: Sorry there is no way I am parsing through all that. You need to distill it down to the simplest form to reproduce the problem. Sorry
[07:08:14] <kurisu> sukima: I dont really have a prolem other than not knowing how to get the effect I'm after
[07:09:14] <thomas`-> Hey. Is there a way to tell jquery to do a post request for iframe src <iframe src="">  ?
[07:09:44] <koskoz> hi
[07:10:05] <kurisu> sukima: basically I just want to get the membersLinks divs to be hidden and slide out when a link is clicked ... but because the list is dynamically generated I cant just use the id
[07:10:06] <sukima> kurisu: Right but you posted the entire website. I can't parse that. If you place just the specific dom your looking at or a sample test that represents what your working with then you could easly gain answeres. The way it is it would take hours to try and get up to speed when you already are.
[07:10:38] <sukima> kurisu: So you need to select the divs based on there relation to the link.
[07:10:40] <Rapala_> hey all, does anyone know of any known issues with the contains-prefix selector and IE7?  I have this selector: $('a[href|="#delete-member"]')  which works great in FF/Chrome/IE8 but fails silently in IE7.  The links it's operating on take the form <a href="#delete-member-123">Delete</a>
[07:10:44] <koskoz> I've got a menu with an arrow like this: http://www.codestore.net/store.nsf/rsrc/796656E2962DFFBA862577BC002BA7C0/$file/arrows_dde8be04-268c-45d0-be8b-2a9dff460ff3.png. What I want is that when the user hover a link on that menu the arrow slides to the selected item. I think I need to use the animate function for that.
[07:10:54] <kurisu> sukima: yes essentially
[07:11:04] <sukima> kurisu: I;ll write an example.
[07:11:22] <kurisu> sukima: thanks
[07:12:08] <kurisu> sukima: much appreciated
[07:18:05] <sukima> kurisu: http://jsfiddle.net/sukima/VKLqs/
[07:19:16] <sukima> kurisu: see how I was able to select element based on the relation they have to another element?
[07:19:36] <sukima> Use tricks like children(), next(), siblings(), parent(), etc.
[07:19:55] <kurisu> sukima: thanks, yes thats essentially what i'm looking for
[07:20:27] <sukima> Glad it helped
[07:21:03] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, ok whats the deal now?
[07:21:13] <kurisu> sukima: should do, thanks again
[07:22:12] <FxIII> I have a container of container of item (lets say a div containing span with a lot of anchor in each span) i want when i select the item i for the container j i want that all the items i for each container becomes red
[07:22:24] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: I'm sure I've made just one silly mistake and I just don't seem to place it
[07:22:41] <sadmicrowave> what browser are you using?
[07:22:47] <FxIII> i can use css :nth-child for this but i want to change the nth-child when an event occours
[07:22:57] <slartsa> chrome
[07:23:33] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, I don't use chrome so I can't test it but does chrome have the Web Developers Toolbar addon like firefox does?
[07:23:37] <slartsa> but I don't think that's the case since your script works
[07:23:37] <FxIII> i load containers over time so i dont want to change the attribute to all the items in the dom
[07:23:50] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: yes
[07:24:04] <FxIII> should i change the value of a <style> to do this?
[07:24:04] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, are you using it?
[07:24:35] <kborchers> FxIII: it's hard to visualize what you are asking, see ?demo
[07:24:59] <kborchers> oh bot-t, why do you fail me
[07:25:11] <slartsa> well uh.. I just right-click on page and examine on element and it pops up the dev "area" and I can see what the code is behind it
[07:25:26] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: not sure what you mean
[07:25:37] <kborchers> FxIII: can you create a http://jsfiddle.net to show us an example of the html you are working with to illustrate your question?
[07:25:37] <slartsa> oops, misread that one
[07:25:49] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, I think thats what I mean. so does it come up with any errors?
[07:25:49] <FxIII> ok kborchers
[07:27:12] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: oh sorry, i was viewing my old version when I took a look of it the last time. apparently there's an unexpeced end of input
[07:27:33] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, do you know how to fix it?
[07:27:55] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: need to take a look...
[07:28:03] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, let me kno
[07:29:18] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: done
[07:29:23] <sadmicrowave> nice
[07:29:31] <slartsa> works :)
[07:29:36] <sadmicrowave> great!
[07:29:50] <FxIII> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/k3syu/ ?
[07:30:35] <FxIII> i want that if i click the item i-th  all the i-th items gets red
[07:30:59] <FxIII> *get
[07:32:06] <FxIII> i should modify the css changin that '1' to 'i' when i varies
[07:33:09] <FxIII> so if i load another page through ajax the i-th element for the new page is automaticaly red
[07:33:45] <FxIII> kborchers: i didnt know this jsfiddle
[07:34:13] <kborchers> FxIII: it's the recommended tool here if you want to mock something up. pretty nice.
[07:34:38] <FxIII> kborchers:  really!
[07:36:05] <kborchers> FxIII: one issue is you can't modify the stylesheet via jQuery so you'll need to keep track of the current selected index and then update the css for the elements. when you load a page via ajax, you'll need to update that css after load. working an example, just a sec
[07:37:17] <FxIII> can i put that css in <style> and refer as $("style#mystile").text() ?
[07:38:18] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: I'm down to one question - and You've prolly noticed already that I'm a complete jquery-newbie - You wrote the code for creating a textarea but textarea tags don't go the same way as inputs or buttons...
[07:38:30] <Raydiation> hm, are there bugs in jquery ui effects? calling stop(true,true) works in chromium but not in firefox
[07:38:42] <slartsa> ...so how should the code be with checkbox for example?
[07:39:04] <kborchers> FxIII: i believe you could make those changes but style tags are only read on page load, when modified, don't believe they are parsed again
[07:39:54] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, type='textbox', type='checkbox', type='radio' are all just attributes of the element.  Therefore if you say $('yourselector').attr({type: 'checkbox'}) you should get the results you want
[07:40:38] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, subbing in the appropriate type you want (like 'radio', 'text', etc) where you see 'checkbox'...
[07:40:42] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: but "          var text = $("<textarea/>").val( i );" is what I'm wondering
[07:41:20] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, oh, var text = $("<input/>").attr({type: 'checkbox'}) for a checkbox
[07:41:45] <FxIII> kborchers: it works in my chrome browser but you say that it cant work on other browser did you?
[07:41:47] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, sorry, I would call it var checkbox or something else besides var text because that is misleading now
[07:42:18] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, var radio = $("<input/>").attr({type: 'radio'})
[07:42:18] <slartsa> awesome, thank you :D yeah I'm changing that
[07:42:47] <slartsa> so the text (that I had put there) was actually what was confusing me <3
[07:43:26] <sadmicrowave> probably, but you also needed to change your selector from $("<textarea/>") to $("<input/>")
[07:43:26] <kborchers> FxIII: i could be wrong but you may have an issue with everyone's favorite browser ... IE
[07:44:21] <FxIII> kborchers: hehehe my application is pessimized for IE :D
[07:44:23] <slartsa> yeah I figured that forwardslash was there to close the tags and jquery would think of the rest
[07:44:54] <FxIII> kborchers: you see we are talking abouth svg:g and svg:path not div and span so IE is out of games :D
[07:45:39] <kborchers> FxIII: you may be able to update the style tags then, but I have not done that and can't imagine parsing the text will be fun
[07:46:56] <VictorCL2> :/

[07:47:38] <DynamicFail> Are there any good tutorials that would allow me to create a conditional form just like this: http://www.tfaforms.com/209012 Where you get different options based on choices (ie if you choose multicast you get additional fields to fill in, if you select no output the output section disappears, and you can add more than one and remove additional outputs) http://www.tfaforms.com/209012
[07:47:49] <FxIII> kborchers: selection occurs less likely than page loading so i belive that is better to change the css that to change the style for each page
[07:48:13] <AdvoWork> ive got: <select name="assign_jobnumber" id="assign_jobnumber"><option value="123456" id="1" data-width="100" data-height="200">  how come this wont work? alert($('#assign_jobnumber').data('data-width').val())  says its basically undefined?
[07:50:44] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: no need for the extra .val() there!

[07:51:19] <Kambfhase> ?g css3please @ VictorCL2
[07:51:40] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, removed that but still says undefined
[07:52:00] <sadmicrowave> its completely amazing how many more people are in here and willing to help than in the StackOverflow chat room
[07:52:13] <Kambfhase> if you use .data() dont repeat it within the quotes. ie .data('width')
[07:52:34] <t4nkd> so has terrible chat
[07:52:38] <shamess> sadmicrowave: you don't get points in the stackoverflow chatroom though, eh? :P

[07:53:44] <[gr]ouzo12> My side.js script contains a simple "$('#side h3').addclass("newclass");" line of code.When i refresh page i cant get it working.Can someone provide some help here?
[07:53:53] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, same problem even with just data('width')
[07:54:05] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, you should post your code in pastebin or something, don't paste code in here
[07:54:06] <Kambfhase> ?p @ [gr]ouzo12
[07:54:08] <kborchers> FxIII: so you could pull my code out of the click binding and put in a function, call the funtion in the click binding, or call the function when the ajax load completes. make sense?
[07:54:26] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: oh, I just noticed something of completely different nature; noticed I had 7 tabs containing stackoverflow pages with helpful advices :)
[07:55:04] <[gr]ouzo12> Apologies.How can i paste inside "pastebin"?
[07:55:25] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, even $('#assign_jobnumber').attr('data-width')  gives undefined :/
[07:55:33] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: make sure you select the <selectes> active option
[07:55:47] <ajpiano> [gr]ouzo12 there are websites like jsfiddle.net and pastie.org etc, where you can paste code and provide a link to it
[07:55:55] <slartsa> IRC definitely needs a function that turns pasted code into a pastebin url
[07:56:02] <ajpiano> [gr]ouzo12, you should also put a $(document).ready(function() { }); block around your code
[07:56:05] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, how do you mean?
[07:56:13] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, i personally like to use jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/ but pastebin is here http://pastebin.com/, just paste your code and click save. then copy the url link and paste it in here
[07:56:16] <FxIII> kborchers: it does but i simply wanted to avoid this since i tipically make a few selection for every hundred of "page" loaded
[07:56:24] <Kambfhase> your select does not have the data attribute. iots on the option!
[07:56:47] <[gr]ouzo12> Thanks for your help :D

[07:59:19] <soc42> is there a way to do this with jQuery and how?
[07:59:38] <Kambfhase> A-tags cannot sed values via POST. you need a input

[08:01:14] <kborchers> soc42: check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:01:25] <kborchers> ajpiano: :D
[08:02:14] <PrinceES> wanna to make a jquery bannner such as ... http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[08:02:26] <PrinceES> anyone has an idea?
[08:02:43] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, like $('#assign_jobnumber:selected').data('height') ?
[08:02:56] <t4nkd> ManCity's site doesn't suck
[08:02:58] <t4nkd> that's refreshing
[08:03:26] <sadmicrowave> soc42, http://pastebin.com/7mxa7fcG
[08:03:38] <kurisu> is it possible to slide left/right with .slideToggle ???
[08:03:43] <juha___> hah i did the most awesome error 404 ever
[08:03:51] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: no, more like this: $('#assign_jobnumber > option:selected').data('height')
[08:04:00] <sadmicrowave> kurisu, no, you need .animate()
[08:04:08] <kurisu> sadmicrowave: ok thnaks
[08:04:35] <ajpiano> PrinceES: they have all their js uncompressed just chillin there, view source

[08:05:54] <GeO`> hey guys
[08:06:10] <GeO`> I'm building a game, and I have an issue on the page where the player chooses his character
[08:06:12] <soc42> sadmicrowave: hey thanksalot, this is more than i expected ;o) i'll sure give it a try...
[08:06:29] <GeO`> basically he has the choice among a lot of images, and he uses arrows to switch them
[08:06:56] <GeO`> I'm using  var dummy  = $('<img />').attr('src','the src.png');  in a loop to preload all the images
[08:07:29] <GeO`> it works well, but when the user manually clicks on an arrow it doesn't interrupts the preload, and it's added to the queue while it should prioritary
[08:07:40] <GeO`> it should be*
[08:08:06] <soc42> sadmicrowave: so this is how to dynamically add hidden fields to a form, but how to set the form "action"-link?
[08:08:08] <sadmicrowave> soc42, you may also include a e.preventDefault(); in the .click(function(e){ }); so the ahref doesn't try to execute
[08:08:13] <Kambfhase> GeO`: is your game live?
[08:08:36] <GeO`> no it's in beta but you can throw an eye
[08:08:42] <GeO`> it's a facebook game tho
[08:08:50] <sadmicrowave> soc42, with the .attr() function.  just add , action: 'mylink' to the .attr() function
[08:09:47] <sadmicrowave> soc42, $("<form/>").attr({method: 'POST', action: 'mylink'});
[08:10:04] <soc42> like this? var form = $("<form/>").attr({method: 'POST', action: 'fooURL'});
[08:10:09] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[08:10:29] <ajpiano> you can also do $("<input/>", {type: "hidden", name: "whatever", value: "whateverelse"}).appendTo(form)
[08:10:40] <ajpiano> but yah, same general principle
[08:10:43] <GeO`> anyone knows how I can deal with this problem?
[08:10:51] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano++ thats true
[08:11:32] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave++ for actually writing the code to help him tho :)
[08:11:42] <ajpiano> GeO`, it's a bit of an obtuse problem to have someone solve w/o code
[08:11:47] <sadmicrowave> ++'s ALL AROUND!!!!
[08:11:57] <webPragmatist> how can i get the computed width of all the li's inside of a ol
[08:12:29] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, are they all the same width?
[08:12:30] <Michael> $('ol').width() ?
[08:12:37] <glen1> bit offtopic, but has anyone use disqus javascript embed. I can't seem to get it working
[08:12:39] <sadmicrowave> Michael++
[08:12:46] <Michael> aw thanks!
[08:13:07] <sadmicrowave> i was just about to put that
[08:13:11] <GeO`> ajpiano : well the only relevant code I use is            for (i=1;i<some_number;i++) var dummy  = $('<img />').attr('src',i+'.png');
[08:13:20] <sadmicrowave> provided he returned to my question and told me that all the li's are the same width
[08:13:49] <ajpiano> GeO`, the idea that somehow some other image would magically get pushed to the front of an already-running/ran for-loop is somewhat specious
[08:13:56] <ajpiano> and obviously there is certianly other relevant code
[08:13:56] <webPragmatist> sadmicrowave: yes
[08:14:01] <silverd> afternoon guys, has anyone used any graphing/chart plugins that they can recommend? Currently looking at graphael or high charts, just wondering if anyone can offer any opinions, pros/cons, etc
[08:14:09] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, then use Michael's suggestion
[08:14:15] <webPragmatist> I can't though...
[08:14:22] <sadmicrowave> please explain
[08:14:34] <GeO`> ajpiano would you recommend another way of preloading images then? To take into account priority
[08:14:36] <ajpiano> silverd, i heard graphael is kinda miserable
[08:14:50] <ajpiano> i think tbranyen can confirm
[08:14:50] <ajpiano> :p
[08:15:06] <ajpiano> silverd, this is kinda new and awesome, just saw it the other day http://dealloc.me/2011/06/24/d3-is-not-a-graphing-library.html
[08:15:29] <ajpiano> GeO`, uh, preload the image when the next button is clicked as well as preloading the images
[08:15:56] <ajpiano> or like, preload them in the order they exist in the dom
[08:15:56] <webPragmatist> I am trying to make a horizontal slider (like itunes) so I have <div><ol></ol></div>   I set the <div> div to a fixed width and overflow auto and the <ol> to a larger width but this is dynamic (based on the <li> so I was just going to use js to set the width of the ul dynamically
[08:16:07] <webPragmatist> sadmicrowave: ^
[08:16:31] <webPragmatist> does that make sense?
[08:16:49] <webPragmatist> i mean maybe there is a way to do this with css...
[08:16:59] <silverd> ajpiano, high charts looks more feature rich compared to graphael, but I'll take a look at that link thanks :) if anyone else has any thoughts, please feel free to pipe up :)
[08:17:13] <timmywil_> .
[08:17:36] <GeO`> ajpiano : they don't exist at first in the DOM, the user chooses to load them. For example there's a HAIR TYPE selector, and he clicks on the left or right arrow to switch them. If I start the preload phase when he clicks first on an arrow that doesn't change anything, the problem appears when he clicks again
[08:17:46] <Michael> webPragmatist, Set the width of the li elements explicitely in your css
[08:18:25] <ajpiano> GeO`: i simply can't intuit enough about the problem from your descriptoins of it, sorry
[08:18:42] <webPragmatist> Michael: that's not going to fix anything. because they will do one of two things "float down" or if I set ol to overflow: hidden "be hidden"
[08:18:54] <GeO`> ye I understand, and I'm french it doesn't help...do you want me to give you the URL so you can have a look?
[08:19:00] <webPragmatist> let me get something on webdevout
[08:19:08] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, with jquery you could do this: http://pastebin.com/2AtXWM18
[08:19:29] <ajpiano> GeO` if it's a url yah, but if it's a FB game, i don't think i can get involved debugging that atm
[08:19:50] <webPragmatist> sadmicrowave: or iterate through .width() ?
[08:19:53] <[gr]ouzo12> I m trying to get this code work.http://pastebin.com/Z4YZ0qaD . addClass works alone.But when i paste the rest of the code lines into the documents nothing works..
[08:20:09] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, why? just get it once and it will be the same through all.
[08:20:10] <GeO`> sent in notice
[08:20:38] <ajpiano> GeO`: it's better to use /msg than /notice
[08:20:55] <ajpiano> GeO`, unfortunately i am not about to start changing my fb settings from https to http etc right now
[08:21:07] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, what is it doing or not doing?
[08:21:09] <GeO`> alright
[08:21:22] <GeO`> thx anyway
[08:21:37] <webPragmatist> sadmicrowave: probably just in case i change the design for them to be dynamic ;)
[08:22:13] <JEET> how to send additional variable value with jquery ui autocomplete?
[08:22:15] <lucenut> Hi, I have a simple jquery validate script for a form making 4 fields required and the 4 custom messages. Now I want to validate that the select box start_date is before the end_date select box.
[08:22:15] <[gr]ouzo12> It was supposed to give a class to all h3 inside #side and do some animations,like changing widths etc so the whole div,witch is possitioned out of screen view,will appear
[08:22:36] <ajpiano> JEET: use source: function() { } and roll your own ajax request
[08:23:09] <lucenut> Am I close with this: (new Date($('#time_started').selected.val())) < (new Date($('#time_ended').selected.val()))
[08:23:37] <lucenut> I got that from the docs but I don't know how to incorporate that in my script.
[08:25:47] <JEET> ajpiano some thing like this? $('#state').keyup(function(){
[08:25:48] <JEET> 	var stocknam= $('#state').val();
[08:25:48] <JEET> 	if(stocknam.length <= 2) {}	else{	$.post("states.php", {countrys: $('#country').val()});}});
[08:25:57] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, I wouldn't do that, but if you must, then yes you should iterate through them and increment a width counter
[08:25:59] <kborchers> lucenut: i believe what you want is - new Date($('#time_started').children(':selected').val());
[08:26:23] <ajpiano> JEET: no
[08:26:35] <ajpiano> i mean, the jquery ui autocomplete "source" option allows you to send your own ajax request
[08:26:40] <ajpiano> and then respond when it has replied
[08:26:46] <ajpiano> and that is how you can send additional parameters to tha ajax request
[08:27:09] <soc42> i am also using a jQuery .toggle()-function to show/hide some parts of a table
[08:27:13] <lucenut> kborchers, do I put that in the validation "rules" or inside the validate function?
[08:27:23] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, I say 'I wouldn't do that' because that is just adding complexity for the sake of adding complexity.  Making all your li elements the same width as your largest li element is good enough
[08:27:30] <JEET> ajpiano: thanks )
[08:27:50] <soc42> how can i also toggle the image within the link <a onclick="...toggle();"...><img src ></a> ?
[08:27:54] <kborchers> lucenut: are you using the validate plugin here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation, something else, or your own?
[08:28:18] <lucenut> Yes, the validate plugin.
[08:28:18] <webPragmatist> i laugh at the face of complexity
[08:28:48] <soc42> is there something like the javascript $this in jQuery?
[08:28:50] <systemfault> webPragmatist: Be careful, it might get its revenge someday.
[08:28:56] <lucenut> http://pastebin.com/KcK90jGu
[08:29:02] <systemfault> webPragmatist: And punch you in the face.
[08:29:03] <lucenut> There is my script.
[08:29:18] <ajpiano> soc42: you should use jquery's click handlers instead of inline event handlers
[08:29:18] <khmer> soc42: jquery is javascript, remember
[08:29:20] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, as do I which is why I made this: http://pastebin.com/kjVuzN6Z
[08:29:24] <lucenut> How do I incorporate the custom validation rule to compare the start and end date?
[08:29:35] <ajpiano> $("a").click(function(e) {  e.preventDefault(); $(this).toggle() })
[08:29:41] <khmer> i just found some awesome code
[08:30:02] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, but you no longer need var liCount. I accidentally left that in there from last edit
[08:30:02] <kborchers> lucenut: you'll need to write your own method. use this one as an example http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/CustomMethods/phoneUS
[08:30:24] <[gr]ouzo12> @sadmicrowave It was supposed to give a class to all h3 inside #side and do some animations,like changing widths etc so the whole div,witch is possitioned out of screen view,will appear.
[08:30:50] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, and its not doing anything at all? or its doing some of it?
[08:31:06] <[gr]ouzo12> Anything at all
[08:31:46] <khmer> $(function(){$.ajax({url:'extremely-expensive-operation.cgi',success: function(data){ // alert('test') }});});
[08:31:51] <webPragmatist> sadmicrowave: oh it's fine i wrote it all myself :) thanks for your help
[08:32:08] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, my first guess would be that its hanging up at the .animate() function.  You can't use .animate() to style your element with css properties like padding-left and text-align.  .animate() is specifically for telling the element where to animate to on the page and how fast to do it
[08:32:17] <sadmicrowave> webPragmatist, NP
[08:33:00] <[gr]ouzo12> So if i want to change some values of my current css styling ,i should not do it with .animate.
[08:33:40] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, you CANNOT do it with animate.  it won't let you...you can do it in your .animate() callback that I see you included but doesn't have anything in it.
[08:34:07] <[gr]ouzo12> ok,got it.Thanks again ! :D
[08:35:18] <b1lly> in my function, am i able to return an array?
[08:36:03] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, have a look at this: http://pastebin.com/GYKeFdMx
[08:36:39] <lucenut> kborcher can you show me how you'd compare the 2 date selects in a custom method? I can't make heads or tails of that example.
[08:36:59] <wladston> any ideas on how can I emulate a click on elements generated by the autocomplete plugin ?
[08:37:11] <Kambfhase> .trigger()
[08:37:12] <wladston> .click() on the generated a element isn't working :(
[08:38:04] <kborchers> b1lly: gonna need a little more info than that. in general, yes, a function can return an array. that's how split() works for example
[08:41:23] <Solow> I want to write a 'detach' method for my plugin... But how do I know which element to detach my plugin from? Should I just detach globally (so from all elements) or store the elements I've attached my plugin to?
[08:42:37] <Julien> hi
[08:43:38] <Julien> the download of jQuery UI is not working http://jqueryui.com/download
[08:43:46] <kborchers> lucenut: this is untested but hopefully will get you started http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/48pL3/
[08:44:20] <kborchers> Julien: works for me
[08:44:22] <Kambfhase> Julien: works for me
[08:44:28] <Julien> :/
[08:44:30] <Julien> ok
[08:44:33] <ajpiano> works for me as well
[08:44:38] <Julien> what is the size please?
[08:44:41] <Zack_> Is there a way to get a list of all the events attached to an element?
[08:44:49] <systemfault> Julien: Over 9000!
[08:44:52] <Julien> of the zip file
[08:44:55] <Julien> lol
[08:45:32] <Kambfhase> Julien: jQueryUI is also  hosted on Googles CDn so might not even have to download it ;)
[08:45:33] <innociv> How do I reverse objects?  .reverse() is just on arrays it looks like
[08:45:47] <Julien> it works now
[08:45:48] <Kambfhase> innociv: you cannot reverse objects. they have no order
[08:45:50] <Julien> weird
[08:45:56] <aca20031> what the heck is the reverse of an object
[08:46:04] <innociv> $.each gives them an order though..
[08:46:12] <kborchers> systemfault: since bot-t's not here, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtpyeLxVkI
[08:46:12] <systemfault> Julien: About a megabyte(The dev version)
[08:46:23] <Julien> ok thx
[08:46:23] <Kambfhase> Only Thing you could try is Object.keys( yourObj).reverse()
[08:46:23] <innociv> if I $.each() some objects, it doesn't iterate randomly
[08:46:34] <innociv> Yeah I could reverse them with a for loop.
[08:46:44] <systemfault> Julien: jQueryUI itself minimized with everything is about 200kb IIRC
[08:46:54] <innociv> .. wait isn't Object.keys mootools?
[08:46:56] <aca20031> yeah, each iterates them all for you - key there that it hides the collection entirely
[08:47:10] <systemfault> innociv: Ecmascript 5 but you shouldn't use it.
[08:47:11] <Kambfhase> innociv: the order of iteration is not defined in the ES5 spec and differs between the immplementations. be careful!
[08:47:15] <Julien> this morning i was getting a file of 67ko , and i it was unopenable
[08:47:26] <Julien> with chrome or FF
[08:47:39] <innociv> Really? I can't trust the order of each of objects to begin with?
[08:47:43] <systemfault> innociv: Won't work on any IE less but IE9
[08:48:01] <systemfault> innociv: Nope, the properties of an object have no order.
[08:48:02] <Kambfhase> there are shims for that
[08:48:08] <innociv> Oh.  WEll mootools adds an Object.keys that works cross browser.
[08:48:14] <ajpiano> Julien: occasionally bizarre stuff like that does happen
[08:48:32] <systemfault> Mootools and prototype love to modify the standard objects (Which sucks)
[08:50:20] <innociv> What's wrong with adding older browser fallback?  I don't think Object.keys replaces it if it exists, just adds support for old browsers.
[08:52:06] <khmer> i won't use anything with a cutesy name
[08:52:07] <khmer> anything at all
[08:52:13] <khmer> so mootools is right out
[08:52:17] <innociv> Haha.
[08:52:23] <Zack_> Is there a way to get a list of all the events attached to an element? The only way I have found is messy:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446892/how-to-find-event-listeners-on-a-dom-node/447106#447106
[08:52:27] <khmer> as is the ford fiesta
[08:52:42] <systemfault> innociv: In that specific case, it's not that bad but before.. some libraries like **cough**prototype**cough** implemented additional functions on the standard objects. Then when browsers started to implement the same function but that worked a bit differently, it caused problems.
[08:52:42] <innociv> Ford Fiesta is a great car with a tragic name, yeah. :(
[08:53:01] <systemfault> Zack_: There's no way... There's might be in the future.
[08:53:09] <innociv> systemfault, yeah.
[08:53:17] <systemfault> Zack_: Usually, it's never needed.
[08:53:20] <necromancer> hi, i'm having some trouble using the jQuery.validate plugin with static class rules. when i execute this code, i get a JS error for line 804 of jQuery.validate.js: "element is not defined" -- https://gist.github.com/1049132
[08:53:51] <Zack_> systemfault: Damn. Time to try something else then. Thank you
[08:54:04] <khmer> necromancer: you sure you're not missing a selector somewhere?
[08:54:23] <amereservant> I'm stuck on a glitch in stopping the image from loading on mouseleave: http://jsfiddle.net/xqrja/
[08:54:23] <necromancer> khmer: go ahead and look in the code
[08:54:30] <koskoz> this is what I've done for the sliding arrow in my header menu: http://koskoz.info/temp/. The thing is, if you hover the thrid intem in the menu and then hover the second one, the arrow will start from the left and not from the right? I tried to play with the offset of my span (which is used for the arrow) but I can't make it work since the span always returns to the selected item when the
[08:54:30] <koskoz> mouseout event is triggered. Any help would be nice, thanks.
[08:54:53] <necromancer> khmer: ".al_required" is the class i want required: true to be applied to...and i'm doing it exactly as it says in the docs...
[08:55:04] <DarkHouse> does anybody know of a good tooltip plugin that allows me to have an html link in the tooltip?
[08:55:12] <amereservant> img isn't always null when it should be and I'm not sure what I'm missing....
[08:55:59] <kborchers> necromancer: take a look here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/required
[08:56:20] <b1lly> im trying to dump a multidimensional array into a cookie and than pull it from the cookie later
[08:56:22] <b1lly> is this possible
[08:56:32] <ajpiano> koskoz: you can use a timeout or http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/docs/files/jquery-ba-throttle-debounce-js.html in order to defer the returning of the offset for a set period in case something happens first
[08:56:36] <necromancer> kborchers: i don't want to set required by name, i want to set it by calss
[08:56:45] <necromancer> so any element with class .al_required is set to required: true
[08:56:55] <necromancer> kborchers: that method only works if you select each field by name
[08:57:29] <Kambfhase> b1lly: yes, ut make sure you ecode the array so in can be deserialized later
[08:57:29] <necromancer> kborchers: i have a huge form to validate just required for, and i'd really like to use this plugin but it's getting really annoying to apply required to all elements using a class rather than laboriously typing each field name out and setting required on each one specifically...not to mention each message!
[08:57:46] <amereservant> DarkHouse, There's several if you Google it.  It's really simple to make one too if you know how to use CSS and positioning.
[08:58:21] <koskoz> ajpiano: what am I suppose to do with the timeout?
[08:58:37] <ajpiano> trigger the animation ?
[08:58:45] <b1lly> Kambfhase: i tried to serialize() the array andt hen unserialize() after i pull it ou f othe cookie and it dont seem to work?
[08:59:10] <Kambfhase> b1lly: try JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
[08:59:49] <b1lly> so arrayname.JSON.stringify()
[08:59:59] <systemfault> b1lly: Nah.
[08:59:59] <koskoz> ajpiano: I'm not realy sure where to put it. Sorry, I've been on this thing for hours, my brain starts to burn
[09:00:07] <systemfault> JSON.stringify(arrayName);
[09:00:17] <ajpiano> koskoz, take a look at the debouncing examples
[09:00:31] <DarkHouse> amereservant: i'm just under a major time crunch, i'm using http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/ right now, but it doesn't seem to allow the tooltip to stay open when you roll over it and off the original link
[09:00:42] <systemfault> b1lly: You might need json2.js if you want to support older browsers.
[09:01:50] <DarkHouse> amereservant: i believe i found one though, thanks
[09:02:49] <kborchers> necromancer: by default, if you assign a class of required, those fields are required, not sure if you can change that but you can either change your class name or just add required in addition to your class
[09:03:19] <b1lly> when you store a cookie does it automatically write over the existing one (if you use the same name), or does it append onto
[09:03:45] <djQuery> morn
[09:03:51] <necromancer> kborchers: i tried that but it only validated a few of the fields, and i still have to explicitly set the message for each field
[09:04:03] <amereservant> DarkHouse, Just tweak the one to not close on mouseout or whatever event it's bound to.
[09:04:49] <kborchers> necromancer: i think you can set a default message with jQuery.validator.messages.required = "";
[09:05:26] <necromancer> kborchers: oh cool
[09:06:07] <kborchers> necromancer: view the source for this demo, it might help
[09:06:08] <kborchers> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/
[09:06:35] <djQuery> necromancer: are you trying to change an idividual message or set it up for a lanquage? there are several language files u can load.
[09:06:49] <sadmicrowave> who all is coding in their mom's basement?
[09:08:54] <necromancer> djQuery: neither. i'm trying to mass-validate a bunch of fields by class. so any field with class="al_required" will be validated as required.
[09:09:00] <nicovalencia> +1 sadmicrowave
[09:10:11] <Narcissus> 1/8
[09:10:13] <Narcissus> /1/8
[09:10:22] <djQuery> necromancer: sorry to interupt then just got here.
[09:13:26] <mipo> hiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[09:13:43] <necromancer> ugh there's GOTTA be an easier way to do this..
[09:13:46] <paul_irish_> rpaddock: yo. you know the html5tx guys
[09:17:01] <sadmicrowave> mipo helllllooooooooo
[09:17:27] <koskoz> ajpiano: I guess I'm dumb but I can't make the debounce plugin works
[09:17:45] <koskoz> ajpiano: no error but it doesn't enter in my callback function
[09:20:56] <koskoz> ajpiano: ok, now I've got an error. The debounce actually call my animation function but then the plugin is throwing me "callback is undefined"
[09:21:20] <ikla> how do I prevent html special characters to show in a textarea? I want the code to display instead of the character
[09:23:29] <mipo> sadmicrowave , how are youuuuuuuuuuu
[09:23:32] <mipo> :D
[09:23:42] <sadmicrowave> good
[09:23:53] <mipo> ;)
[09:34:58] <koskoz> ajpiano: I've finally succeeded, it works like a charm, thanks
[09:35:09] <ajpiano> koskoz, good news :)
[09:35:13] <ajpiano> sorry i couldn't look in between
[09:35:39] <koskoz> ajpiano: no problem, that was me writing dumb code
[09:37:54] <koskoz> ajpiano: I've talk too fast ><
[09:39:28] <koskoz> ajpiano: If you can have a look at this using your browser's console: http://koskoz.info/temp/ and the js is here: http://koskoz.info/temp/js/plugins.js
[09:39:57] <ajpiano> you don't have the script in cluded
[09:40:02] <ajpiano> that's what it means that it is not a function
[09:40:33] <koskoz> ajpiano: wut?
[09:40:45] <ajpiano> uhh
[09:40:56] <ajpiano> le script n'est pas dans le web page
[09:41:31] <Kambfhase> hehe
[09:41:32] <koskoz> ajpiano: I did understand well when you were speaking english ;)
[09:41:43] <ajpiano> hahah
[09:41:49] <gym_jane> can i ask a javascript question here or do i need to go to #javascript?
[09:42:02] <koskoz> ajpiano: but the script is there, my bad: http://koskoz.info/temp/js/script.js
[09:42:03] <gym_jane> they are not very responsive :/
[09:42:21] <ajpiano> koskoz, the debounce plugin is another script
[09:42:24] <ajpiano> you have to put that script in your page
[09:42:30] <ajpiano> or add it into your plugins.js
[09:43:39] <Kambfhase> gym_jane: ask
[09:43:46] <koskoz> ajpiano: look at the end of the plugins.js: $.debounce = function( delay, at_begin, callback ) {
[09:44:20] <ajpiano> oh i had a cached page
[09:44:57] <koskoz> ^^
[09:45:04] <gym_jane> Kambfhase i got this http://pastebin.com/pgMWK7ZN which works fine for the "form" but i need to make it work with the select tag instead if that makes sense
[09:45:10] <Reedyseth> Hey guys I have a topic to discuss, Is it good to use the jQuery Mobile in order to support all browsers on a normal webpage or stay with the normal jQuery API ?
[09:45:32] <ajpiano> Reedyseth: use jquery mobile if you're trying to create something that feels like a mobile app
[09:45:40] <ajpiano> not just to create parity between desktop websites
[09:45:47] <ajpiano> oh
[09:46:00] <ajpiano> koskoz, you have to pass a function, not execute it
[09:46:05] <gym_jane> so basically when a user selects a particular option the "sendToActionscript" function gets the value
[09:46:14] <ajpiano> $.debounce(250, function() {  placeMenuArrow($("whatever")); });
[09:46:31] <koskoz> ajpiano: I've already tried that, and the function is never called
[09:46:42] <ajpiano> koskoz, you should actually use doTimeout, so you can cancel it at the right time
[09:46:52] <Kambfhase> gym_jane: why does the <form> not surround your <select> ?
[09:47:12] <sterlo> Is there a way to distinguish between two jQuery version being included on the same page?
[09:47:15] <sterlo> versions*
[09:47:17] <ajpiano> koskoz, the way you have it now, you aren't passing a function to be debounce, so it definitely won't work
[09:47:21] <gym_jane> Kambfhase i need to get rid of the whole form thingie
[09:47:30] <gym_jane> only want to have the select tag
[09:47:34] <ajpiano> koskoz, you also probably need some timers around the mouseover function as well
[09:47:40] <ajpiano> koskoz, i just can't get too deep into this
[09:47:52] <Kambfhase> <select> should belong to a form.
[09:47:53] <Reedyseth> ajpiano: this is what I thought but I was ready on de site about the cross browser support and sounded a good Idea, but you're right is you  use a mobile device use the API for the mobile device :p
[09:47:53] <koskoz> yeah I understand ajpiano ;)
[09:47:57] <ajpiano> koskoz, you might also just be able to use the hoverIntent plugin
[09:48:16] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I was just gonna suggest that
[09:48:16] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I need a method similar to .html() but that includes the item selected... for example <p id='a'><p>hello</p></p> if i run $('#a').html() I get only the innerhtml... how to get the outerhtml ?
[09:48:19] <erichynds> sterlo: the only way to accomplish that is if one of the versions is assigned to a variable using noConflict(true)
[09:48:20] <ryanneufeld> we use it in production
[09:48:24] <ajpiano> koskoz http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[09:48:24] <ryanneufeld> and it's great
[09:48:26] <ajpiano> yeah it's good
[09:48:38] <Kambfhase> gym_jane: so what was you problem again?
[09:48:45] <erichynds> sterlo: so jQuery referencing that variable will be using a diff version than just $
[09:48:48] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ mbutubuntu
[09:48:52] <gym_jane> wait i am lost myself :/
[09:49:03] <sterlo> erichynds: so if 1.4.2 is loaded and then 1.6 is loaded...and they are just loaded equally - there's no way to reference them independently? Just whatever was registered last will be used?
[09:49:26] <erichynds> you can, but not without some work
[09:49:30] <erichynds> 1.6 will overwrite 1.4
[09:49:38] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: I believe 1.6 will not
[09:49:43] <erichynds> unless you declare noConflict(true) in between the <script> tags
[09:49:44] <sterlo> even if its before 1.4?
[09:49:45] <Reedyseth> mbutubuntu: perhaps you can try to select the children of the selecte element
[09:49:49] <Gates> Is there an effective way to track the .hide and .show in Google Analytics?
[09:49:50] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: it will do a no-conflict on it's own I think
[09:49:52] <Gates> maybe as a sepreat page?
[09:49:56] <Gates> seperate*
[09:50:08] <sterlo> what will the no conlfict variable look like?
[09:50:19] <sterlo> by default
[09:50:29] <mbutubuntu> Reedyseth, the children contains also other unuseful elements...
[09:50:47] <erichynds> var jq14 = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[09:50:49] <erichynds> then load 1.6
[09:50:55] <erichynds> and use $ for 1.6
[09:51:02] <erichynds> and jq14("selector") for 1.4
[09:51:03] <erichynds> kinda thing
[09:51:05] <sterlo> I don't have a say in how 1.4 is being loaded - that's the lame part :)
[09:51:26] <sterlo> old developer unregistered a default library in the application - and linked to his own - so now it's at 1.4.2
[09:52:22] <sterlo> the overall plan is to get rid of his application - but until then I need to make the new stuff work with his old janky stuff.
[09:53:07] <sterlo> Thanks @erichynds @ryanneufeld
[09:57:00] <koskoz> I've wrote that using hoverIntent, but it still doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/1x7N7N62
[09:57:09] <koskoz> I think I'm just dumb or fried be the heat
[09:57:13] <koskoz> or both
[09:58:51] <koskoz> timeOut instead of timeout, I'm definitly fried
[09:59:26] <ShockIt> hello guys
[09:59:32] <ShockIt> do you know jquery-tools ?
[09:59:48] <ShockIt> i'm having a problem with apple_overlay, it's something really... insignificant
[09:59:57] <ShockIt> how do i stretch out the width of it?
[10:01:13] <necromancer> ShockIt: be more specific
[10:01:22] <necromancer> jsfiddle your code that's not working
[10:01:25] <ShockIt> i just need to increase the width
[10:01:29] <necromancer> or just explain your problem more than "it doesn't work"
[10:01:38] <ShockIt> the property width of that apple_overlay
[10:01:51] <ShockIt> http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/apple.html
[10:02:14] <necromancer> ShockIt: so you want to increase the size of the popup lightbox
[10:02:31] <ShockIt> yes :)
[10:02:48] <necromancer> ShockIt: have you looked in the CSS file?
[10:02:54] <necromancer> overlay-apple.css or whatever?
[10:03:08] <necromancer> you'll find what you're looking for in there :)
[10:03:08] <ShockIt> there's not a css :D
[10:03:12] <ShockIt> i mean
[10:03:16] <necromancer> uhh
[10:03:18] <necromancer> there should be
[10:03:19] <ShockIt> i just created a .apple_overlay
[10:03:24] <ShockIt> in my own css
[10:03:26] <d4rklit3> hi
[10:03:35] <ShockIt> and setting height:
[10:03:43] <ShockIt> or min-height: doesn't work
[10:03:51] <d4rklit3> so I neglected to add h1/h2 hierarchy to a site we just launched (wtf do i know, im a flash developer)
[10:04:09] <d4rklit3> anyways.. can you guys direct me to perhaps some reading on how that works
[10:04:38] <necromancer> ShockIt: http://static.flowplayer.org/tools/css/overlay-apple.css has the CSS of the demo. play around with that
[10:04:38] <AaronDCampbell> What is the difference between .bind('submit',...) and .bind('submit.validate',...)?
[10:04:50] <ShockIt> 		width after the growing animation finishes
[10:04:50] <ShockIt> 		height is automatically calculated
[10:04:50] <ShockIt> 	*/
[10:04:50] <ShockIt> 	width:640px;	
[10:04:52] <ShockIt> see ?
[10:04:54] <ShockIt> :)
[10:04:57] <necromancer> oh
[10:05:08] <ShockIt> even they don't give an example
[10:05:11] <necromancer> ShockIt: you may have to modify the plugin
[10:05:12] <ShockIt> ffff
[10:05:15] <ShockIt> i knew it
[10:05:17] <necromancer> they don't seem to have a config option
[10:05:18] <ShockIt> ok, nvm
[10:05:20] <necromancer> lol jquery tools is bs anyway
[10:05:25] <ShockIt> bs ?
[10:05:32] <necromancer> you can do that easily with your own plugin or jquery.facebox heavily modified
[10:05:36] <necromancer> it's bullshit
[10:05:39] <ShockIt> oh right
[10:05:42] <necromancer> their plugins suck
[10:05:52] <ShockIt> it's ok
[10:05:55] <ShockIt> it's just for one page
[10:05:57] <erichynds> much better than facebox
[10:05:58] <ShockIt> with three windows
[10:06:01] <ShockIt> it does the work
[10:06:10] <ShockIt> and it's nice to see
[10:06:19] <ShockIt> that's the only thing that counts for the client
[10:06:22] <necromancer> AaronDCampbell: bind('submit') submits the form normally. bind('submit.validate') is a custom event that some plugin made up i guess
[10:06:29] <necromancer> bind('submit') is submit(), btw
[10:06:33] <kborchers> AaronDCampbell: that is namespacing, check out http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/09/namespace-your-events
[10:06:39] <necromancer> erichynds: how so? facebox is way easier to modify
[10:06:50] <erichynds> just look at the source
[10:06:54] <erichynds> it's garbage
[10:07:05] <AaronDCampbell> kborchers: Thanks.
[10:07:10] <necromancer> erichynds: everything i've seen from jQuery Tools doesn't show that it's nearly as easy to customize the look and feel of
[10:07:23] <erichynds> might be so, i haven't used either
[10:07:31] <erichynds> facebox might be easier to customize
[10:08:20] <Cats4Gold_> Anyone ever have problems with jquery dialogs opening at the bottom of your page?
[10:08:53] <necromancer> lol what
[10:08:54] <Cats4Gold_> Currently, all my jquery dialogs open right in the middle of the viewport
[10:08:55] <necromancer> erichynds: you
[10:08:56] <mbutubuntu> how to move an object in the top of the parent element?
[10:08:59] <Cats4Gold_> Except on one page
[10:09:08] <necromancer> erichynds: what kind of retard disses two plugins that they've NEVER used?
[10:09:19] <Cats4Gold_> It opens on the bottom of the page, even though i never specify a position: 'bottom'
[10:09:20] <necromancer> i mean...
[10:09:21] <erichynds> i have eyes and can read source code?
[10:09:28] <ShockIt> lol
[10:09:29] <ShockIt> guys
[10:09:30] <erichynds> i usually look at the source before i decide to use them
[10:09:34] <ShockIt> don't fight over my choice
[10:09:40] <erichynds> and can tell that facebox is poorly written
[10:10:36] <d4rklit3> !seo
[10:10:37] <d4rklit3> ?
[10:10:49] <d4rklit3> does the bot know anything about jquery+seo
[10:11:00] <kborchers> mbutubuntu: try $("#moveMe").insertBefore($("#moveMe").siblings(":first"));
[10:11:01] <necromancer> erichynds: i've seen plenty of plugins written that way, never had a problem with any of them
[10:11:08] <erichynds> necromancer: cool
[10:11:09] <necromancer> tests > personal coding prefrence
[10:11:13] <necromancer> preference*
[10:11:45] <necromancer> d4rklit3: it's not really a hot topic. what do you need to know?
[10:11:53] <necromancer> the reason is because search engines can't execute javascript
[10:12:05] <necromancer> so...there's not much jQuery can do to help out with SEO
[10:13:11] <d4rklit3> well my site has a lot of dynamic content
[10:13:14] <d4rklit3> actually
[10:13:20] <d4rklit3> http://locos.ifc.com
[10:13:24] <d4rklit3> we just launched this
[10:13:30] <systemfault> d4rklit3: If you care about SEO, use PE.
[10:13:32] <d4rklit3> the only static html is in the headers/logos
[10:13:34] <d4rklit3> what is PE?
[10:13:46] <d4rklit3> systemfault, i personally don't care about SEO, but the client does :P
[10:14:22] <d4rklit3> the site is pretty much all ajax except the top and bottom part
[10:14:46] <necromancer> d4rklit3: wow that sound is annoying..
[10:14:57] <d4rklit3> there is a sound?
[10:15:00] <BarelyFitz> d4rklit3: at least try adding some heading elements and alt tags on your images
[10:15:10] <necromancer> d4rklit3: on the video? you developed it! ;)
[10:15:17] <d4rklit3> lol i didn't develop the video
[10:15:22] <necromancer> haha i'm kidding
[10:15:23] <d4rklit3> the client just picked it
[10:15:24] <d4rklit3> :P
[10:15:38] <d4rklit3> like it would be nice to make that video list crawlable
[10:15:53] <d4rklit3> but since its all JS
[10:16:02] <d4rklit3> it seems impossible
[10:16:05] <djQuery> cant change the channels
[10:16:10] <djQuery> stupid tv is broke
[10:16:13] <d4rklit3> haha
[10:16:20] <erichynds> d4rklit3: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html
[10:16:22] <d4rklit3> please don't QA the site djQuery
[10:16:42] <d4rklit3> erichynds awesome
[10:18:11] <d4rklit3> erichynds what if my page is ONE page
[10:18:19] <d4rklit3> actually
[10:18:29] <d4rklit3> i guess everytime u click a category
[10:18:34] <d4rklit3> its technically a different page
[10:19:16] <erichynds> indeed
[10:19:21] <erichynds> that's when you'd update the hash
[10:19:46] <erichynds> or bang-hash, whatever they call it
[10:19:47] <d4rklit3> erichynds do i do that just by setting an anchor?
[10:20:18] <erichynds> I would use something like jquery BBQ
[10:20:29] <erichynds> (plugin)
[10:20:39] <d4rklit3> also where does it talk about server provisions
[10:20:43] <d4rklit3> for taking html snapshots
[10:21:12] <erichynds> you can learn more here: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/
[10:23:01] <d4rklit3> basically the client would have to install something on their server?
[10:23:12] <erichynds> wat
[10:23:13] <erichynds> no
[10:23:18] <r3v3rb> hello
[10:23:22] <d4rklit3> well how would the server take a snapshot
[10:23:27] <r3v3rb> stupid question coming
[10:24:13] <r3v3rb> can i use jquery to hide the url data from an href when clicking through to a new page
[10:24:29] <d4rklit3> yeah erichynds looks like the server would need to install sutff
[10:24:30] <d4rklit3> stuff
[10:24:37] <erichynds> you form crawlable pages using a special URL hash, "#!page=about" for example, and google knows how to crawl them
[10:24:39] <d4rklit3> rather we would need to install stuff on the clients server
[10:24:57] <d4rklit3> all these pages say it needs to be able to take an html snapshot
[10:25:00] <d4rklit3> of the page
[10:25:08] <r3v3rb> say i had www.abc.com/index.php?id=1000&data=xyz
[10:25:32] <d4rklit3> so when the crawler requests to see the page, the server needs to know how to take an htmlsnapshot to make it crawlable
[10:25:38] <r3v3rb> but i want to load a page preferable using post but only an anchor to send the visitor onwards
[10:25:39] <d4rklit3> maybe im not reading this correctly
[10:26:19] <r3v3rb> i dont want them to see the url data, i know I could use an AJAX post but then I lose the SEO from the multiple pages - or do I nowadays?
[10:26:33] <d4rklit3> r3v3rb you do
[10:26:45] <r3v3rb> still lose the SEO?
[10:27:02] <d4rklit3> yeah
[10:27:08] <d4rklit3> im tryin to figure it out now
[10:27:34] <erichynds> the snapshot is just generated HTML that google can crawl.  the page gives you recommendations on how to achieve that, but a simple php script or whatever is also capable
[10:27:49] <r3v3rb> bugger, so how can I 'post' the data using an anchor i don't want to create a form for each element - although I could do it with jquery... I have over 350 links to produce
[10:29:22] <AaronCampbell> Is there anything in jQuery that can show a backtrace...let me see what exactly is calling a particular function?
[10:29:46] <AaronCampbell> I think I'm having issues with a submit even being triggered twice in IE7 but I'm having a heck of a time tracking it down.
[10:30:20] <ShockIt> i want to strangle the jquery tools creator
[10:30:45] <erichynds> AaronCampbell: console.trace()
[10:30:50] <r3v3rb> d4rklit3, actually its 711 links to recreate with this data ! argghgh
[10:31:12] <kborchers> r3v3rb: what if you generated all of your links as they are, with the querystrings so search engines can crall, but then use an onClick that posts your data via AJAX and then return false so that the browser doesn't try to follow the link
[10:31:53] <r3v3rb> kborchers, would that still work, or would the spiders see the ajax response ?
[10:32:04] <r3v3rb> do they ignore js?
[10:32:20] <kborchers> spiders don't execute js, at least i don't think they do
[10:35:24] <b1lly> im trying to create a multi-dimensional array but the first array is an associative array and the second is just a normal
[10:35:53] <Kambfhase> an "associative array" ia called object in JavaScript
[10:36:09] <kborchers> r3v3rb: you could create a small test then in goog webmaster tools use fetch as googlebot to see if it executes the js
[10:36:23] <Kambfhase> but where is your problem?
[10:36:24] <r3v3rb> indeed
[10:36:36] * r3v3rb is going to try it now
[10:36:46] <b1lly> http://pastie.org/2130142
[10:37:06] <Kambfhase> You are doing it wrong!
[10:37:07] <b1lly> basically it alerts binState['key'] properly, but if i alert binState; it returns empty
[10:38:42] <b1lly> ok? suggestion?
[10:38:57] <Kambfhase> b1lly: http://pastie.org/2130154
[10:39:20] <diegocn> hello ppl... is there any jquery plugin that help me with ajax crawler?
[10:39:52] <necromancer> diegocn: what is ajax crawler?
[10:40:07] <necromancer> diegocn: you talking about this? http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html
[10:40:13] <diegocn> yeah
[10:40:17] <diegocn> that is it
[10:41:19] <necromancer> diegocn: we were just talking about this before you came in here :)
[10:41:21] <necromancer> [1:20 PM] <erichynds> I would use something like jquery BBQ
[10:41:26] <necromancer> i have no idea what that is but erichynds seems to :)
[10:41:32] <diegocn> lol
[10:41:38] <necromancer> i'd just follow the specifications on http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/
[10:42:12] <necromancer> usually what i do is use the #p=id&x=4... syntax and make that available as /?p=id&x=4 as well in order to appease Google
[10:42:32] <necromancer> but apparently, Google's got a system for crawling Ajax applications, so i'd just use that specification and design your apps URLs around that
[10:43:21] <diegocn> i'll try something and post back
[10:43:29] <diegocn> thanks!
[10:43:46] <necromancer> how do you return the jQuery object's tag name? i tried the pure JS property .tagName but it doesn't produce anything
[10:44:08] <erichynds> $("#foo")[0].nodeName
[10:46:20] <systemfault> He could probably use ".prop" no?
[10:46:56] <sukima> Is there a huge difference between 1.6 and 1.5 that one should be careful upgrading without research?
[10:47:33] <sean`> systemfault, yes
[10:48:21] <systemfault> sukima: Just the attr VS prop thingy.
[10:48:24] <systemfault> AFAIK.
[10:48:52] <lopakodo> hey guys. is it possible to convert a [object Object] type into a string? googled, but stuff like new string(obj) didnt work.
[10:48:55] <b1lly> lets say i had an element, and wanted to move it into another elemnt
[10:49:02] <b1lly> i know i can append it to the new element
[10:49:10] <b1lly> but am i suppsoed to depend and then append
[10:49:11] <systemfault> lopakodo: What do you want to do with it?
[10:49:21] <b1lly> or is there a function to remove and replace
[10:49:22] <DofLeFou> Greetings
[10:49:42] <lopakodo> i want to append it to another string.
[10:49:44] <Kambfhase> b1lly: if you use append or appendTo it will be automatically removed from its old position
[10:49:44] <b1lly> lopakodo: JSON.stringify() ?
[10:49:57] <lopakodo> hm. ill give it a shot.
[10:50:04] <Aquaguy> Hello there, I'm doing a XMLHttpRequest but I get Origin xxxx is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin, how can I solve this?
[10:50:06] <systemfault> You can't append objects like that ..
[10:50:20] <Kambfhase> lopakodo: you might want to get yourself a console!
[10:50:25] <kborchers> lopakodo: if you use console.log instead of alert that will help
[10:50:30] <systemfault> Aquaguy: If you don't have control of the other site, nothing at all.
[10:50:40] <systemfault> Aquaguy: XHRs are bound by the SOP.
[10:50:41] <DofLeFou> I m doing a .POSt and the response of it is a CSV .... is there a way to send that response directly to the browser
[10:51:02] <DofLeFou> https://gist.github.com/1049360
[10:51:12] <Aquaguy> systemfault, I own the site
[10:52:20] <systemfault> Aquaguy: You can set proper headers for CORS but I would simply avoid as it's not really compatible with older browsers.
[10:52:40] <systemfault> Aquaguy: Usually, people use JSONP hack as a workaround
[10:53:18] <Aquaguy> systemfault, isn't there any way to tweak the apache server config to allow access to any domain?
[10:53:38] <systemfault> aquatix: It's XHR itself, the SOP is enforced by the browser.
[10:53:55] <toaotc> hi there - can anyone tell me why $('form :image[src="image.png"]) does'nt work?
[10:54:47] <Kambfhase> toaotc: you are missing a '
[10:55:04] <Kambfhase> plus why is there a : in front if image?
[10:55:05] <toaotc> thats not the reason :D - but thx
[10:55:17] <toaotc> $('#booking_form input:image[src="/images/button_back.png"]')
[10:55:26] <toaotc> looks better
[10:55:27] <DofLeFou> any taker https://gist.github.com/1049360
[10:55:35] <systemfault> toaotc: Not sure jQuery has a shortcut for that one
[10:55:44] <systemfault> toaotc: Try with the real CSS notation
[10:55:46] <Kambfhase> ah, ok, i wrong
[10:56:04] <systemfault> form input[type="image"][src="image.png"]
[10:56:15] <sukima> systemfault: Thanks
[10:56:28] <DofLeFou> toatotc: try using a class
[10:56:41] <kborchers> systemfault: actually, i think that should work http://api.jquery.com/image-selector/
[10:56:57] <lopakodo> json.stringify isnt working, it creates array of some things.
[10:57:05] <kborchers> systemfault: your way is better though
[10:57:10] <lopakodo> im trying to append the string that:
[10:57:11] <lopakodo> 	  $(xml).find("product").each(function()
[10:57:11] <lopakodo> 	  {
[10:57:11] <lopakodo> 	  	   $(this).find("id");
[10:57:12] <lopakodo> returns
[10:57:15] <DofLeFou> somewhere in you .css file ... create that image src in there
[10:57:31] <khmer> toaotc: you may also run into the nonstandard src property, so use src*= instead of src=
[10:57:42] <DofLeFou> and try using that class in your jquery ... it might owrk
[10:58:04] <Kambfhase> lopakodo: dont paste code into the irc. especially if you indentationsucks
[10:58:25] <Kambfhase> pleas epaste it somewhere
[10:58:57] <lopakodo> ok, sorry
[10:58:58] <toaotc> $('form input[type=image][src="/images/button_back.png"]') seems to work - thanl you :))
[10:59:21] <marktuk> i've got a slide show, in firefox when i switch away from the tab for a while, and switch back, there's like a backlog of animations that all fire at once
[11:00:07] <Kambfhase> markatto: is your page live?
[11:00:16] <marktuk> it's like firefox pauses the animations but lets the time carry on and just queues the animations up
[11:00:36] <marktuk> any way to stop this?
[11:00:52] <lyrae> i have quick and hopefully simple question about scope. inside an ajax call i set var errror = true, but outside, it doesnt seem to recognize that it's true. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/421436/
[11:00:57] <lyrae> am i doing anything wrong?
[11:01:13] <r3v3rb> seriously you have to love jquery !
[11:01:15] <Kambfhase> lyrae: learn javascript.
[11:01:41] <marktuk> lyrae: only do var error once
[11:01:47] <lyrae> i tried that
[11:01:48] <marktuk> the rest of the time just do error =
[11:01:50] <r3v3rb> 711 links created in 5 minutes. using data extraction, a split and then an wrapInner to build the links...
[11:02:03] <lyrae> didnt work so i put vars on the others. =/ hold on let me retry
[11:02:06] <Kambfhase> lyrae: by doing var error = true; you create a new local error variable. so you do not set the outer variabl. remove the var
[11:02:41] <r3v3rb> Kambfhase, true indeed infact that goes for pretty much any modern programming language ;)
[11:03:15] <Kambfhase> lyrae: btw, an ajax call is async, that means line 24 will be executed before line 19!!
[11:03:23] <marktuk> it's common practice in most languages to establish your vars first
[11:03:40] <Kambfhase> r3v3rb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6445794#6445794
[11:04:09] <lopakodo> is there a way to convert what .find() returns into a real string? when i display returned content, it looks like a string. but when i try to join it with another string, i get string + object.
[11:04:20] <Kambfhase> well JS has lexical scoping so a lot of ppl get it wrong
[11:04:30] <marktuk> check this out http://snook.ca/technical/fade/fade.html in firefox, tab away from it for a couple of mins, then tab back
[11:04:49] <marktuk> you'll see it suddenly starts catching up on the animations it missed, anyway to stop this?
[11:05:03] <Kambfhase> lopakodo: get yourself a javascript console
[11:05:11] <r3v3rb> lexical scoping? never heard that term Kambfhase
[11:05:31] <pielgrzym> how can I send an extra argument to the function that is bound to an event like this: elem.bind("keypress". $.fn.my_function) ? I want to send it settings :)
[11:05:54] <Kambfhase> r3v3rb: it just means that while other languages bind their variables to blocks, JS binds them to functions.
[11:06:20] <r3v3rb> c# binds to method(function) though
[11:06:36] <r3v3rb> no?
[11:06:55] <lopakodo> kambfhase: i have the firebug console if thats what u mean.
[11:07:04] <Kambfhase> pielgrzym: .bind() can take an extra event data param: .bind( eventType, [eventData,] handler(eventObject) )
[11:07:36] <Kambfhase> lopakodo: do you have Firequery?
[11:08:02] <lopakodo> nope? should i get it?
[11:08:03] <Kambfhase> it will show you which elements are returned by .find()
[11:08:10] <lopakodo> ok, thanks.
[11:08:43] <lyrae> Kambfhase, thats interesting
[11:08:45] <pielgrzym> Kambfhase: thanks!
[11:08:52] <Kambfhase> :)
[11:09:29] <toaotc> join #symfony
[11:10:04] <Kambfhase> toaotc: missing a / there ;)
[11:10:14] <toaotc> thx :)
[11:10:33] <pielgrzym> Kambfhase: how can I get this event data? function(e) { var settings = e.data.settings; } ?
[11:10:59] <BarelyFitz> join #donkeyshowmeetup
[11:11:03] <BarelyFitz> oops
[11:11:20] <pielgrzym> when I use settings as a global var in my plugin's namespace they are all shared among plugin invocations on entirely different elements/settings
[11:11:51] <pielgrzym> I hate js for this whole global clutter shit
[11:12:14] <Kambfhase> i hate CSS for the very same reason.
[11:12:44] <Kambfhase> that code from above looks ok, btw.
[11:12:58] <pielgrzym> Kambfhase: nvm, e.data :) thanks!
[11:13:30] <Kambfhase> :)
[11:13:43] <SeanJM> how would I check to see if $(this) doesn't have a certain class as a parent?
[11:13:48] <MoTiOnXml> given an array of jQuery objects, what is the shortest way of checking whether a target element is contained within the array of elements?
[11:13:52] <sukima> pielgrzym: var namespace = {}; namespace.whatever = value; <=-- fixes that problem
[11:13:55] <MoTiOnXml> jQuery.contains() works for single elements
[11:14:04] <Brodingo> ?has
[11:14:10] <MoTiOnXml> hmm
[11:14:19] <Brodingo> argh bot-t where art thou
[11:15:07] <Brodingo> is(:has(elem))
[11:15:17] <mipo> hi
[11:15:31] <pielgrzym> sukima: ok, how to make this namespace variable availible accross all my methods inside my plugin, given that this var is initiated with main plugin method (and extended from some defaults)?
[11:15:38] <mipo> I have a pages list with parent and sub , that's unlimited
[11:15:41] <marktuk> seriously, nobody knows the solution to this queued animation glitchin firefox?
[11:15:42] <MoTiOnXml> Brodingo: i'll check it out - thanks :)
[11:15:45] <mipo> I want to make filter for that
[11:15:52] <marktuk> okay it's not just firefox, wtf
[11:15:53] <pielgrzym> sukima: my plug is (function($) { .... })(jQuery)
[11:16:30] <pielgrzym> sukima: say plugin method is $('input').somePlug({custom: 'settings', here: true});
[11:17:09] <sukima> Sorry not seeing any globals there
[11:17:11] <pielgrzym> sukima: when I have a global settings definied in somePlug they are shared accross .somePlug invocations thus, the last invocations sets settings for every one before
[11:17:14] <marktuk> someone, opening this in a browser http://snook.ca/technical/fade/fade.html, then open another tab and stay there for a few minutes
[11:17:24] <b1lly> is there a way to return all the elements for #id that have no children?
[11:17:31] <marktuk> when you tab back, it'll 'catch up' on all the animations, i missed, how do i stop this?
[11:17:34] <r3v3rb> hmm, adding <a> using each function and wrapInner then trying to use $('a').live('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }
[11:17:44] <pielgrzym> sukima: https://gist.github.com/1049417
[11:17:47] <r3v3rb> but it doesnt stop the click through
[11:17:49] <pielgrzym> sukima: line 11
[11:17:57] <sukima> pielgrzym: Oh! well then couldn't you assign them to this instead of what ever global variable your using?
[11:18:36] <Brodingo> marktuk likely because setInterval is being capped
[11:19:00] <Bodu> if try to add selectID: 1, after line 19 of http://orkans-tmp.22web.net/star_rating/#main-menu=4&demo-tabs=2, selectID doesn't work for me. why?
[11:19:08] <pielgrzym> sukima: I could and I will. but this is really painfull in js that's all :) hoped I was missing some magic stuff that made my settings crap all over plugin though ;)
[11:19:59] <marktuk> Brodingo: reading about that now, what's the solution?
[11:20:02] <sukima> pielgrzym: The code looks good to me. you sure line 11 is what is being clobbered? Have you tried it with a different variable name?
[11:20:13] <pielgrzym> sukima: code works
[11:20:21] <r3v3rb> any idea why preventDefault() isn't working?
[11:20:26] <Brodingo> marktuk: probably using recursive setTimeout
[11:20:35] <Brodingo> r3v3rb: are you passing the event object?
[11:21:03] <pielgrzym> sukima: but when I do: $('input.one').formatInput({max_length: 10}); and next: $('input.two').formatInput({max_length: 2}); both inputs will have settings.max_length: 2 :/
[11:22:08] <r3v3rb> Brodingo, going to do a jsfiddle now ;)
[11:22:09] <pielgrzym> sukima: when I make line 4 local (var settings) and pass them to events in event data the problem is fixed. only I hate to remember about passing around some shit that should be global ;)
[11:22:17] <DoctorDarren> Is this correct convention?:   $('.mydiv').slideUp().remove()   ? Or should I do the remove as a callback of the slideUp?
[11:22:31] <pielgrzym> DoctorDarren: I'd go for callback
[11:23:00] <pielgrzym> DoctorDarren: since you might remove it while anim is still in progress
[11:23:25] <DoctorDarren> pielgrzym: $('.mydiv').slideUp("normal", function() { $(this).remove(); } );   right?
[11:23:38] <pielgrzym> DoctorDarren: yup
[11:23:40] <MoTiOnXml> Brodingo: i'm doing: if ($this.options.ignore.has(sender.get(0)).length > 0) { return; }
[11:23:44] <MoTiOnXml> Brodingo: works perfectly - thanks
[11:23:48] <DoctorDarren> pielgrzym: Awesome thanks
[11:24:01] <b1lly> if (is there a way to target the parent element and remove it but not its children? unwrap only works if you target the children
[11:24:27] <lucenut> I am using the jQuery validator plugin and would like to highlight the formfield rather than write out an error message. How do I do that?
[11:24:36] <Brodingo> ummm ok
[11:24:43] <pielgrzym> DoctorDarren: np :)
[11:25:36] <sukima> pielgrzym: try putting this.settings = ... instead see if that scopes it correctly
[11:26:01] <r3v3rb> Brodingo... http://jsfiddle.net/V5ZUd/2/
[11:26:21] <r3v3rb> myData isnt used yet ;) need to stop the default behaviour before moving on
[11:26:50] <lucenut> Anyone know how to highlight for error validation?
[11:27:04] <pielgrzym> sukima: this binds settings into the element that will be affected by the plugin, right?
[11:28:02] <sukima> pielgrzym: not sure trying it out in jsfiddle. now.
[11:28:17] <marktuk> Brodingo: recursive setTimeout seems to work fine, many thanks!
[11:28:24] <Brodingo> cheers!
[11:28:38] <r3v3rb> bro any chance of taking a look at the fiddle i posted?
[11:28:48] <khmer> in general, why do people use recursive setTimeouts instead of setInterval and clearInterval?
[11:29:26] <marktuk> khmer: if your dealing with animations, browsers queue the animations when the tab/window isn't in focus, but the setInterval keeps firing
[11:29:44] <marktuk> so you end up with the browser suddenly playing catch up when you bring it back in to focus
[11:29:59] <khmer> oh fair enough!
[11:30:18] <Brodingo> im not really sure what youre doing there r3v3rb what isnt working exactly?
[11:30:24] <marktuk> a recursive setTimeout only lets 1 animation build up
[11:30:48] <Brodingo> r3v3rb: best way to get help is to narrow down the most basic use case of what isnt working
[11:30:56] <marktuk> personally i think the browser behaviour is a bit odd...
[11:31:36] <skamikaze> o/ Suhana :)
[11:31:37] <r3v3rb> Brodingo, i'm adding the links using a wrapInner, but then I want to stop the link from processing when clicked and do some ajax...
[11:31:59] <r3v3rb> i am creating the link so the spiders can still get to the following pages
[11:32:11] <r3v3rb> otherwise i wouldn't bother ;)
[11:32:24] <Brodingo> well i dont see anything with the button class
[11:32:33] <Brodingo> thats probably why your lil event handler isnt working
[11:32:52] <r3v3rb> thats because like a twat i took it out a minute ago...
[11:33:02] <r3v3rb> lol, but it wasn't working before either...
[11:33:55] <r3v3rb> ah ha ! I escaped my quotes on the class in the wrapInner and all is well :D
[11:36:16] <lucenut> Can someone help me change the color of the formfields instead of displaying an error msg using the validator plugin?
[11:38:25] <sukima> pielgrzym: I think what you may want is the data() api
[11:40:37] <pielgrzym> sukima: is it a part of jquery? if not I'll stick to passing stuff around since it needs to be dep-less ;)
[11:40:59] <marktuk> Brodingo: actually, it doesn't appear to have worked =/
[11:41:03] <pootpoot> how expensive is calling the .find() method rather than calling .children().siblings().children().whatever
[11:41:30] <erichynds> find() is a lot more forgiving when your DOM structure changes
[11:41:39] <erichynds> so +1 for find
[11:41:39] <marktuk> doesn't make sense, the setTimeout shouldn't refire because i put it in the callback of the last animation
[11:43:30] <sukima> pielgrzym: yes
[11:46:04] <marktuk> perhaps i was too hasty
[11:46:09] <marktuk> something wierd going on here forsure
[11:48:47] <pielgrzym> sukima: I think I'll put all my internal function definitions inside formatInput - this fixes scope issues and is most flexible (and seems to work for now :D) :)
[11:48:54] <pielgrzym> sukima: thanks for help! :)

[11:52:17] <MistuhKurtz> with YepNope, say i'm loading some resources and then doing some JS inside the complete: function()
[11:52:20] <Armern[away]> Hi guys, I'm using draggable in my project, and I need to perform a check once the draggable has completely finished animating to its new position. However, the stop event appears to be called on mouseup rather than when the animation is completely done. Anyone know how to deal with this? ^_^
[11:52:38] <MistuhKurtz> could I just take all of that javascript inside complete: function() { } and add it as the last resource with yepnope?
[11:52:56] <MistuhKurtz> and it will run after all the other resources before it ran, right?
[11:53:43] <TehCodr> does this work: http://pastebin.com/aWefJEdW
[11:54:00] <TehCodr> I'm trying to make the menu drop down immediately if you click it
[11:54:07] <TehCodr> but otherwise, slide down gracefully
[11:55:29] <TehCodr> the site I'm testing it on: http://skarab.net/
[11:55:50] <pielgrzym> sukima: yeah, this works :) check this one out too: https://gist.github.com/1049507
[11:56:39] <skamikaze> pielgrzym: insertSpaces shouldn't be bound to $ as $ always returns your element set
[11:56:39] <pielgrzym> sukima: I'm also concerned if my stuff like filterEvent doesn't clutter jQuery namespace (and it obviously should be private to a plug)
[11:56:58] <skamikaze> pielgrzym: nvm
[11:57:08] <pielgrzym> skamikaze: latest version changes this :)
[11:57:11] <sukima> pielgrzym: That's it?! just a misplaced var statement! Huh go figure!
[11:57:49] <pielgrzym> sukima: no, I've moved all functions into formatInput not $.fn :)
[11:57:49] <sukima> pielgrzym: still look into data() it is a really useful tool in plugg-ins (thats' whe it was made for)
[11:58:05] <sukima> pielgrzym: Ahh yes that would do it too!
[11:58:07] <pielgrzym> sukima: yeah, it's for storing stuff inside elements right?
[11:58:10] <TehCodr> quick question: Are there any popular jquery video tutorials? I don't follow too well with reading (ADHD)
[11:58:36] <sukima> pielgrzym: yeah like setting values . hehehe
[11:58:42] <kborchers> Armern[away]: are you using draggable with a sortable?
[11:59:16] <Armern[away]> kborchers: No, it's just a draggable that has a grid size specified..
[11:59:30] <pielgrzym> I'm wondering - is there an easier, yet less problematic way to filter all keys that have a modifier or special meaning (like enter, tab, backspace)? this if(key....) approach sucks big time ;)
[11:59:38] <pielgrzym> sukima, skamikaze ^
[11:59:52] <pielgrzym> talking bout line 25
[12:01:06] <skamikaze> pielgrzym: var keys = [ 8, 9, 13, 35, 36,37,38 ]; if( -1 !== $.inArray( keys, key ) { ..
[12:01:07] <skamikaze> ?
[12:01:08] <skamikaze> :)
[12:01:27] <Armern[away]> kborchers: This is the code I'm using if you're interested: $('.item').draggable({ containment: "parent", grid: [120, 40], stop: function(e,ui) { alert("Drag event stopped, but I sure didn't finish animating!"); } });
[12:01:44] <lucenut> I am using the jquery validator plugin and have it displaying error messages but would like to highlight the formfields instead. How can I do that?
[12:02:41] <kborchers> Armern[away]: hmmm, are you defining an animation somewhere? by default, dragging and dropping a draggable has no animation
[12:03:14] <pielgrzym> skamikaze: ah, cool! I was missing python's "in" operator so much :) thankfully jQuery fixes that :)

[12:03:22] <insign> hide() uses display none, how can I use visibility hidden and get back with fadeIn()?
[12:03:36] <skamikaze> pielgrzym: besides IE you can use javascripts indexOf
[12:03:38] <MoTiOnXml> why can't I do $("<div>content</div>")?
[12:03:41] <MoTiOnXml> it fails
[12:03:52] <skamikaze> pielgrzym: ie <8 tbh
[12:04:09] <pielgrzym> skamikaze: yeah, ie makes life miserable :D
[12:04:12] <pielgrzym> as usual
[12:04:40] <skamikaze> no, supporting oldtimers makes life miserable :P
[12:04:53] <MoTiOnXml> why can't I do $("<div>content</div>")?
[12:05:08] <MoTiOnXml> does jQuery only support the elements, then asking for .html() afterwards?
[12:05:21] <fantomas> Hi all. Is there a plugin which can do smart text wrapping in titles? Under "smart" I mean for example not leaving 2-letters words at the end of lines, no breaking "names" in quotes etc.
[12:05:41] <erichynds> you can do that with css, fantomas
[12:05:46] <Armern[away]> kborchers: No that's what I found interesting as well.. I define no animation anywhere. Wait!! Now that you mention it.. haha, brilliant, I am using css3 animations. Let me see what that does.
[12:05:47] <erichynds> i think
[12:05:52] <fantomas> erichynds: I can't actually )
[12:05:58] <erichynds> damn
[12:05:59] <fantomas> erichynds: css is too limited
[12:07:37] <lucenut> Anyone? I'm sure it's a simple question, but how can I change the color or highlight the formfields instead of displaying an error "message"?
[12:07:46] <fantomas> Is it possible to get coords for every letter? Or I have to wrap every letter inside a <span> for example?
[12:08:04] <kborchers> lucenut: you have to use showErrors
[12:08:54] <Armern[away]> kborchers: That's the problem! Who would've thought that. Hehe thanks for pointing that out. I already thought 'hey wow that's cool, they even gave it fancy animations'... XD Guess I should be more careful in the future.
[12:09:22] <insign> hide() uses display none, how can I use visibility hidden and get back with fadeIn()?
[12:10:22] <kborchers> lucenut: in there you should be able to find the offending fields and highlight them instead of, or in addition to the messages
[12:11:14] <lucenut> I see there's a "highlight" option in the validator. I thought that was it.
[12:11:53] <kborchers> lucenut: see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions and scroll down to showErrors
[12:13:26] <lucenut> OK, where would I put the "$(".selector").validate({..."?
[12:13:42] <lucenut> I mean I already have that function right?
[12:14:01] <lucenut> Would I just put the highlight and unhighlight in after the rules and messages?
[12:14:04] <Suhana> oh hai skamikaze - caught me mid meeting o/
[12:14:49] <kborchers> lucenut: yes, those are defined as options in the same way
[12:16:00] <lucenut> So then I have to create a class "errorClass" to apply to the formfields?
[12:17:05] <TehCodr> fantomas: CSS3 has text wrapping fetures, and so do CSS2 and CSS1
[12:17:10] <TehCodr> features*
[12:20:44] <sadmicrowave> alright, I'm trying to remove an element using DOM object tree hierarchy. Here is an example: http://pastebin.com/hWAZPWEJ does anyone know how to do this?
[12:21:47] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: $(event.target).prev().children(":last").remove();
[12:23:09] <sadmicrowave> kborchers and here I was using jquery function .remove() without the jquery initiator :p
[12:24:41] <quuxman> How do I manipulate <script> tags with jQuery?
[12:25:25] <ryrych> hi guys
[12:25:31] <rixius> quuxman: what are you trying to do?
[12:25:38] <quuxman> if I run: $(foo).html("<script>alert('test')</script>"); $(foo).children() and $(foo).html() are both empty strings
[12:25:50] <quuxman> but the alert does appear
[12:26:02] <rixius> jquery does some magic when "inserting script tags"
[12:26:14] <quuxman> :-[
[12:26:17] <rixius> and instead just runs it in the global scope itself AFAIK
[12:26:18] <necromancer> quuxman: you can't do that in the DOM either, iirc
[12:26:27] <ryrych> how to make a regexp for url parameters? can't figure it out :( this won't work  "[\\?&]" + param + "=([\w]+)"
[12:26:41] <quuxman> rixius: so no script elements are ever created?
[12:26:51] <rixius> not by jquery that I know of
[12:27:00] <necromancer> ryrych: http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascript.html
[12:27:10] <necromancer> quuxman: you can't even really do that in the DOM
[12:27:23] <quuxman> I actually want the code though in this case. I have a text box where people can embed code, and I want to include JavaScript
[12:27:24] <Aristata> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/W6EJg/ ANd more specifically, how do I get one specific parents up the chain from a dom, when other things are parents before it.
[12:27:34] <necromancer> like var foo = getElementByID('foo'); foo.children won't show that <script> in there :)
[12:27:51] <necromancer> quuxman: are you looking to execute the JS on the fly so they can see it in a preview or something?
[12:28:07] <quuxman> necromancer: that, and also to be able to send the code to the server so it gets stored in a DB
[12:28:14] <necromancer> Aristata: try .find('.append')
[12:28:33] <necromancer> quuxman: HTML isn't interpreted when it's in a <textarea>
[12:28:36] <quuxman> necromancer: this particular code expects to be an element embedded in the DOM (twitter widget)
[12:28:39] <necromancer> quuxman: so it will get to the database
[12:28:42] <ryrych> necromancer: I have got a basic knowledge on this matter, have done some regexps but I cant put this one together.
[12:29:01] <necromancer> quuxman: your best bet is to submit to DB with ajax, and then grab the results with ajax in the preview window simultaneously
[12:29:20] <kborchers> Aristata: why would you do all of that if you could just say $("#blah").parent().append(...); ?
[12:29:23] <necromancer> so when you type something in the <textarea>, it saves your work to the database, and at the same time the preview window will read the results from DB into a <div>
[12:29:31] <ryrych> necromancer: sometimes it is hard to sort out a problem even with a manual
[12:29:40] <quuxman> necromancer: damn, that adds complexity
[12:29:52] <Aristata> kborchers:  Becasue that is a simple abstraction of something more complex in practice
[12:30:04] <necromancer> quuxman: there's a reason there aren't too many live JS editors on the internet ;)
[12:30:13] <Aristata> necromancer:  is there something that allows one to "find" and get the first matching element up the tree rather than down?
[12:30:26] <Aristata> i would like to find up, then find down
[12:30:27] <necromancer> ryrych: regex is no joke, but JS regex is at least a little easier to deal with. what are you trying to do? you may be able to just .split().join() the URL string and parse out variables
[12:30:59] <kborchers> Aristata: .parent(".section") will be empty since that is not a parent. you might want .parents()
[12:31:02] <rixius> ryrych: this is the way I got GET variables: https://gist.github.com/487874#file__get.js
[12:31:21] <rixius> it was definantly .splits and .joins
[12:31:26] <Aristata> kborchers:  parents works, but if I have two section classes, i only want the first one
[12:31:41] <necromancer> Aristata: find('selector').first()? i don't know how "first matching element up the tree" would be different than the first element found
[12:32:04] <Aristata> necromancer:  if it's always first then that's no problem, I will give it a try
[12:32:18] <necromancer> Aristata: elements are given in the order they appear on the page iirc
[12:32:38] <necromancer> that's the way it works with DOM anyway
[12:32:53] <Aristata> well that suits my needs perfect
[12:32:54] <kborchers> Aristata: you mean first in the tree or first as you traverse up the tree? if first in tree, necromancer's solution works, i first as you traverse, try closest(".section")
[12:33:05] <Aristata> kborchers:  first as you go up
[12:33:16] <Aristata> ahhhh
[12:33:19] <Aristata> closest
[12:33:21] <kborchers> Aristata: definitely closest then
[12:33:24] <Aristata> lemme look into that
[12:33:31] <Aristata> thanks guys
[12:33:34] <kborchers> np
[12:33:45] <Aristata> if those things work I feel a lot of javascript being simplified in my fguture
[12:33:48] <Aristata> future*
[12:36:16] <ryrych> rixius: I see, thanks; I have e.g an href with value "video.swf?width=640&height=480" and I want to grab width and height; my regexp is "[\\?&]" + param + "=([\w]+)" but exec returns null
[12:37:57] <rixius> with mine you'd use __GET['width'] and __GET['height']
[12:38:03] <rixius> ryrych: ^^
[12:41:07] <Aristata> kborchers:  necromancer: Perfect, this worked wonderfully guys.
[12:41:15] <necromancer> =P .find is your friend
[12:41:21] <necromancer> took me a little bit before i realized how awesome it was
[12:41:26] <necromancer> another great method is .closest :)
[12:41:30] <quuxman> necromancer: making a round trip to the server wouldn't solve anything
[12:41:49] <quuxman> you'd still have to insert the <script> tag as an HTML string
[12:42:24] <necromancer> quuxman: so you type in the <script> in your textarea, it saves to DB and spits it out as HTML, which since it's being parsed as HTML would then execute the JS in your <script> tag. hopefully.
[12:42:35] <necromancer> note that embedded inline JS using ajax isn't the most reliable method of executing javascript..
[12:42:37] <quuxman> necromancer: and whether I use jQuery or the underlying innerHTML attribute, it doesn't update the DOM with the new <script> element. It only appears in the DOM if it's loaded along with the page source
[12:42:49] <TehCodr> woo, I finished the first part of my website
[12:42:57] <necromancer> quuxman: you're not understanding what i'm saying, and if you're a beginner with JS and jQuery this may be a little advanced
[12:43:02] <TehCodr> modified an existing jquery command to handle clicks, too :D
[12:43:05] <Jee5us> Hi, guys. I have a problem. I have one js file containing functions and another file from where I run the functions. I have included the "engine" file before the main.js but console sais that there is no such function. any ideas?
[12:43:06] <quuxman> necromancer: I'm not a beginner
[12:43:08] <necromancer> oh ok good
[12:43:15] <necromancer> (can't be too careful in here)
[12:43:21] <quuxman> necromancer: I have no problem executing the script. The problem is including it in the DOM in a specific place
[12:43:32] <highend> hi. I have a small problem with a code snippet. it's used by a wordpress theme. Link for the snippet: http://highend.pastebin.com/sy25m0du
[12:43:35] <highend> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function. Line 2 in this script. Does anyone know how to solve this?
[12:43:55] <highend> forgot a line... If I open the corresponding site with chrome I can see this error:
[12:44:00] <quuxman> necromancer: this is specifically for widgets like the Facebook like button and Twitter things that insert elements where the <script> is included
[12:44:22] <necromancer> ahhhh i thought this was like a code preview thing or something
[12:44:35] <kborchers> Jee5us: it would help to see what you're talking about to give a little context to your question. link?
[12:45:14] <Anticom> hi all
[12:45:25] <Anticom> can anyone help me with the "flot" plugin?
[12:45:43] <necromancer> quuxman: you probably don't want to deal with simultaneous DB updating/calling then...i'd suggest just using a PHP file or something to parse out fake tags like <follow>@twitter_handle</follow> and turn them into inline script calls. because you need to include the facebook/twitter js files also..
[12:46:02] <pielgrzym> how can I detect that text inside an input field is highlighted??
[12:46:27] <Jee5us> kborchers: http://paste2.org/p/1492171
[12:46:45] <SeanJM> I want to check if $(this) is a child of a .class, I've been searching a bit on the internet, and I can't seem to find a solution that works
[12:46:56] <necromancer> my solution *will* work, it's just going to be very difficult to build & test. if you're unsure of the kind of stuff going into those <script> tags it would be useful, but if the only 2 JS things you're going to use are twitter & facebook widgets i'd suggest just hard-coding them into your parser and letting your customers do <facebook> or <twitter> in the HTML
[12:47:25] <necromancer> SeanJM: $(this).parent().hasClass('class') :)
[12:47:26] <quuxman> necromancer: :-P. Yuck
[12:47:51] <SeanJM> necromancer: doesnt parent() just go up one level?
[12:47:57] <Brodingo> SeanJM: if($(this).closest('.class').length)
[12:48:05] <necromancer> yeah but you can do parentsUntil
[12:48:35] <necromancer> you could check if ($(this).parentsUntil('.class').length)
[12:48:39] <SeanJM> necromancer: if $(this).parentsUntil('.class).length
[12:48:40] <SeanJM> necromancer: yeah
[12:48:47] <necromancer> .closest() would work but if you're concerned with overhead it doesn't make sense
[12:48:59] <necromancer> you KNOW it's a parent, so use the .parentsUntil function. .closest will look for children too iirc
[12:49:13] <Brodingo> um no
[12:49:25] <Brodingo> closest goes up, find goes down
[12:49:29] <kborchers> necromancer: .closest only goes up
[12:49:31] <necromancer> oh really?
[12:49:34] <necromancer> i thought it went both directions
[12:49:43] <necromancer> fuck it then
[12:49:44] <jkline> How do I close a jQuery UI Dialog from within? My dialog is populated from the result of an ajax request. I want a "close" button to be part of the ajax response. I tried jQuery('#close_buttom').closest('.ui-dialog').dialog("close") but that does not seem to work.
[12:49:49] <kborchers> nope closest ancestor
[12:49:52] <necromancer> SeanJM: disregard my bullshit. use .closest()
[12:50:06] <necromancer> because .closest() will stop when it reaches something that matches its selector right?
[12:50:25] <kborchers> necromancer: yes
[12:50:38] <necromancer> is the only difference between .parentsUntil() and .closest() that .closest() elements don't have to be in the DOM hierarchy?
[12:50:42] <Jee5us> kborchers, any luck?
[12:51:02] <sadmicrowave> for those of you familiar with the $.ajax() event. this is my first time attempting to use the beforeSend: method and was wondering if it is only intended to act upon the jqXHR data being sent or if I can use it to create my own functions like: function(){ $(".myselector").remove() }
[12:51:09] <necromancer> like if i have <div id="foo"> <div id="bar"></div> </div> <div id="bar2"></div>, i'd need .closest to find #bar2 but .parentsUntil to find #foo
[12:51:20] <SeanJM> Brodingo: it returns 0 length no matter where I click. What I am trying to do is check if a click is happening outside a certain div
[12:51:35] <SeanJM> necromancer: same thing with parentsUntil
[12:51:38] <jkline> sadmicrowave: You can use beforeSend to do whatever you want, including showing "spinners" or removing your selector
[12:51:44] <kborchers> Jee5us: not sure, you did include jquery as well, right? i know, stupid question but can't think of why that would happen.
[12:51:52] <Jee5us> yes I did
[12:51:57] <sadmicrowave> jkline thanks
[12:52:15] <Jee5us> kborchers, meh...i'll hack on. I bet I will figure it out. Thanks for the attention
[12:52:35] <necromancer> SeanJM: lol $('body').not('thediv').click() ;)
[12:52:37] <kborchers> Jee5us: yeah, sorry, that's a strange one.
[12:52:51] <necromancer> (i don't think that's the best option)
[12:55:05] <SeanJM> necromancer: do you know of a good option?
[12:55:40] <highend> I have a small problem with a code snippet. It's used by a wordpress theme. Link for the snippet: http://highend.pastebin.com/sy25m0du If I open the corresponding site with e.g. chrome I can see this error: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function. Line 2 in this script. Does anyone know how to solve this?
[12:57:23] <jkline> ok, I think I answered my own question about how to close a jQuery UI Dialog from within. jQuery("#close_button').closest('.ui-dialog-content').dialog("close")  because the dialog object is attached to the .ui-dialog-content element, not the .ui-dialog element.
[12:57:29] <notanumber> G'day.  I'm still newish to jQuery.  Mostly a Python developer.  But, I have a form on a page that I'd like to clone prior to submitting, keeping all of the **updated** data.  Currently, I'm using `.clone()`, but this only seems to clone the data as it was when the page loaded, not with the user's changes.  What am I missing?
[12:57:38] <insign> jquery have anyone function with info about the user-agent or the browser?
[12:57:39] <erichynds> highend: jQuery isn't included on your page properly
[12:58:19] <jkline> insign: If you need to know the user-agent you might be doing it wrong. What is the task you are attempting to accomplish?
[12:58:33] <kborchers> insign: you should not browser sniff, feature detect instead
[13:03:15] <Beta2K> Hello all
[13:03:28] <Beta2K> I'm having some troubles POSTing data with colorbox
[13:04:03] <Beta2K> I checked the variable coming in (id) and it's right, but my php script isn't showing anything in $_REQUEST
[13:04:23] <Beta2K> $.colorbox({href:'<?php echo $ROOTURL?>sale.php',data:{'saleid':id},open:"true"});
[13:04:35] <Beta2K> The same format works in a ajax .load()
[13:13:19] <insign> navigator.userAgent
[13:15:34] <kborchers> insign: again, if you need to detect the browser to make something work, most likely you're doing it wrong
[13:18:36] <r3v3rb> any one good with ajax here ?
[13:18:52] <kborchers> r3v3rb: what's your question?
[13:19:03] <r3v3rb> i have my $.post working but need some help with the success and complete functions
[13:19:14] <r3v3rb> i get success is not a function atm
[13:19:32] <systemfault> r3v3rb: Where's the code?
[13:19:40] <systemfault> My crystal ball died yesterday
[13:19:42] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/jneJm/
[13:19:44] <r3v3rb> ;)
[13:19:46] <kborchers> systemfault: took the words out of my mouth ;)
[13:19:49] <r3v3rb> lol
[13:19:52] <r3v3rb> gimme a chance
[13:20:19] <systemfault> kborchers: data is "air", that's the problem
[13:20:23] <systemfault> Err
[13:20:28] <systemfault> I mean r3v3rb
[13:20:47] <systemfault> r3v3rb: You use "data" but it doesn't exists
[13:20:47] <r3v3rb> argghh
[13:20:58] <r3v3rb> :P took out function(data) didn't i !
[13:21:00] <systemfault> :)
[13:21:00] <r3v3rb> idiot
[13:21:02] <r3v3rb> ;)
[13:21:09] <systemfault> Shit happens
[13:21:40] <r3v3rb> too often here !
[13:21:52] <imsky> lol
[13:22:20] <kborchers> r3v3rb: i was thinking it actually had more to do with the need to define success and complete inside the options being passed to post, rather than trying to chain non-existant functions
[13:22:51] <r3v3rb> only following JQuery.post doc's atm
[13:23:05] <insign> kborchers, the correct?
[13:23:34] <MoTiOnXml> is there a quick way to ask a jQuery object if anything is bound to it using e.g. click?
[13:23:35] <kborchers> really? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ the first example looks nothing like yours
[13:23:46] <MoTiOnXml> i'd like to get a reference to the click events
[13:23:49] <r3v3rb> hmm, works until .complete doesn't fire jScrollPane... http://jsfiddle.net/jneJm/1/
[13:23:51] <MoTiOnXml> to sort of re-bind the events
[13:24:14] <r3v3rb> #centrePanelMain updates now i need to fire jScrollPane again...
[13:24:27] <kborchers> r3v3rb: because you defined it wrong
[13:24:32] <r3v3rb> oh
[13:24:41] <r3v3rb> should it be jqxhr.complete
[13:24:58] <kborchers> no, just a sec, i'll fix it
[13:25:10] <MoTiOnXml> come on - a quick tip :)
[13:25:21] <MoTiOnXml> inspect element for click-bound event handlers?
[13:25:23] <MoTiOnXml> no? :)
[13:26:48] <kborchers> r3v3rb: i see your issue, you are mixing up .post() and .ajax() which .post() uses. you will need to change to use ajax() instead of post() to have the complete callback
[13:27:10] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:27:30] <r3v3rb> np
[13:27:34] <r3v3rb> thanks
[13:28:12] <r3v3rb> so the docs lie?
[13:28:18] <Woet> the docs never lie
[13:28:20] <r3v3rb> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:28:26] <r3v3rb> .complete
[13:30:06] <kborchers> r3v3rb: i see what you are referring to. honestly, i never knew those existed since I always just use .ajax() since it's more flexible
[13:30:09] <Kambfhase> woet++
[13:30:58] <r3v3rb> hmmm, nm, i'll try to refactor this to .ajax
[13:31:03] <Woet> r3v3rb: where is your latest code (with .post)?
[13:31:12] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/jneJm/1/
[13:31:40] <r3v3rb> its not a problem to refactor will only take a couple of minutes
[13:34:27] <Woet> i don't see the problem r3v3rb: http://jsfiddle.net/jneJm/4/
[13:34:32] <Woet> :)
[13:35:36] <r3v3rb> Woet, problem is jScrollPane doesn't fire on newly added content
[13:35:39] <r3v3rb>  ;)
[13:35:42] <Woet> okay, so jSrollPane sucks
[13:35:43] <Woet> not the docs
[13:35:46] <r3v3rb> lol
[13:35:54] <Woet> [22:28:17] <Woet> the docs never lie
[13:35:56] <r3v3rb> touch
[13:36:10] <Woet> it's not written by humans, which make mistakesi
[13:36:15] <r3v3rb> ok jScrollPane sucks
[13:36:18] <Woet> it's written by bot-t and he's awesome
[13:36:32] <r3v3rb> you mean my code was correct - flack thats a first
[13:36:33] <r3v3rb> ;)
[13:36:40] <Woet> no, you missed data in your function arguments
[13:36:52] <r3v3rb> :P
[13:36:57] <n20> http://pastebin.com/0JKrUUDv <--- how come it doesn't remove the element?
[13:37:14] <kborchers> Woet: too bad bot-t is taking a vacation day. could have used a bunch of his witty comebacks today. ;)
[13:37:23] <Kambfhase> john resig doesnt do documentation. he just wrte codes which self documents out of fear
[13:37:23] <r3v3rb> any ideas on jScrollPane and the callback?
[13:37:25] <Woet> bot-t is taking a lot of vacations these days
[13:38:25] <Kambfhase> n20: i suppose you have more than one element with the calss .ad-placer-link-hover ?
[13:39:40] <n20> Kambfhase: I will hav,e but at the moment only 1.
[13:40:35] <Kambfhase> ok. thats problem 1) problem 2) is that .remove() only checks if the current elment matches the selector, not the children.
[13:40:59] <n20> Kambfhase: Oh, then I'll have to do children('#foo').remove()?
[13:41:09] <n20> Kambfhase: For the 2)
[13:41:14] <Kambfhase> yes
[13:41:21] <Kambfhase> lets go back to 1)
[13:41:25] <erichynds> if you remove the parent, all children go with it
[13:41:44] <erichynds> ancestors*
[13:41:47] <Kambfhase> IDs must be unique in the whole document. therefore hte code might have some problems.
[13:42:29] <erichynds> descendants*
[13:42:30] <erichynds> heh
[13:42:35] <n20> Kambfhase: Just asecond
[13:42:55] <Buffon> hi .. i want to know the source of the function used in jquery .. if i hope to develop.. what i suppose to do?
[13:43:12] <n20> Kambfhase: Works like it should now. :-D
[13:43:15] <Kambfhase> https://bit.ly/jqsource
[13:43:59] <albertosheinfeld> hey guys, one quick question
[13:44:08] <Kambfhase> n20: you might want to cosinder writing your code like this, btw: http://pastebin.com/0KSuXA79
[13:44:22] <Kambfhase> fuck, forgot the .children() but you'll see what i mean
[13:44:31] <albertosheinfeld> i am using $(document).ready to run some scripts after the DOM is loaded, but it's firing the scripts before all images are in place, any ideas???
[13:44:43] <Kambfhase> albertosheinfeld: a quick question? that 5$
[13:44:49] <albertosheinfeld> for example it's telling me positions that are not true...
[13:45:09] <erichynds> albertosheinfeld: doc.ready fires before images have loaded
[13:45:20] <erichynds> you might want to bind to the load event of the images
[13:45:25] <erichynds> or window.load
[13:45:31] <albertosheinfeld> ok!
[13:45:34] <erichynds> eer, window.onload
[13:45:37] <albertosheinfeld> let me try that, thanks!
[13:46:32] <n20> Kambfhase: Thank you sir, that's some nice jquery. :-)
[13:46:41] <albertosheinfeld> worked like a charm!!! thanks!
[13:48:10] <WarDekar> I know this is probably really easy to do but I'm unsure how to do it... I have a form on my page and when the user submits it it sends a request, during the request I want it to just have an hourglass or w/e, then when it gets a response i don't want to change pages I just want to switch which Div is currently visible
[13:49:40] <freeceiling> hi. I'm trying to understand a bit of javascript code (that uses jQuery calls). var getacc_id = parseInt(window.location.hash.slice(1)); a possible url would look like this: www.domain.it\test\#0
[13:50:01] <freeceiling> what value would contain getacc_id in this case?
[13:50:07] <Kambfhase> 0
[13:50:32] <freeceiling> and only with /#   (no following number)?
[13:51:07] <r3v3rb> damnit Woet you're right jScrollPane is crap
[13:51:08] <freeceiling> sorry. \# and not /#^^
[13:51:09] <aaairc> would you guys recommend time a time frame selector?
[13:51:19] <Woet> r3v3rb: yay! the docs prevail again
[13:51:23] <r3v3rb> got it working but it truncates the bottom of the loaded text !
[13:51:35] <r3v3rb> so you can't scroll to the bottom!
[13:51:40] <Woet> yay!
[13:51:43] <r3v3rb> great bit of software not
[13:52:04] <Kambfhase> freeceiling: without a Number you'd get NaN (thats Not A Number)
[13:52:14] <Assimilater> so it appears that if i have a jquery object representing a row then $(row).children('select') appears to return nothing i think because .children is composed only of td's, sound about right? if so what is a more appropriate selector for select objects in row?
[13:52:32] <Assimilater> (row of a table sorry)
[13:52:51] <Kambfhase> Assimilater: try $(row).find('select')
[13:52:54] <ruprict> Holais there a way to use the {{if}} jquery template tag and short circuit the 2nd half of the conditional?  For example, this raises an error: http://jsfiddle.net/ruprict/YtHHK/ testing for the property first, then using it if it exsits.
[13:52:59] <r3v3rb> what a load of old pants
[13:53:00] <Assimilater> ah, that will probably do it :P
[13:53:01] <freeceiling> Kabfhase: and if(!getacc_id) rewritten is: if (getacc_id != 0)?
[13:53:35] <ruprict> Ugh
[13:54:12] <ruprict> Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/YtHHK/1/
[13:54:14] <ruprict> (sorry)
[13:54:22] <Kambfhase> freeceiling: nope
[13:55:04] <Assimilater> works like a charm, thanks Kambfhase
[13:55:21] <Kambfhase> if( !getacc_id) "equals" if( getacc_id == false) << there might be some edgecases though
[13:55:25] <Kambfhase> Assimilater: :)
[13:56:00] <Anticom> re
[13:56:15] <Anticom> can anyone help me with the jq "flot" plugin? =/
[13:56:55] <freeceiling> Kambfhase: I think I'm too stupid ;). May I post a few lines on pastebin to make more clear what I'm after?
[13:57:03] <Kambfhase> yeah!
[13:57:16] <freeceiling> http://highend.pastebin.com/jC09YP0p
[13:58:52] <r3v3rb> i want my mommmmmmmmmyyyyyyy its not fair
[13:59:08] <Woet> Anticom: just ask your question
[13:59:17] <jdee> r3v3rb, you can have mine
[13:59:32] <freeceiling> Kambfhase: my problem is, the page opens with the second accordion open with /#1 and third accordion with /#2. The first one should open with /#0 but it doesn't. only when I use /# it opens the first accordion (without the 0 after)
[13:59:58] <Anticom> Woet: i want to build a simple html file displaying a line graph with an ajax stream fireing every second and adding the data to the graph
[14:00:24] <Woet> Anticom: sounds good, go for it
[14:00:25] <Anticom> but i simply don't get it, because the documentation of flot is not the best
[14:00:44] <Anticom> and besides i'm a jq and js newbie (=
[14:00:55] <r3v3rb> jdee, not sure thats ethical is it - giving you mom away over irc?
[14:00:58] <Woet> Anticom: http://code.google.com/p/flot/source/browse/trunk/examples/ajax.html?r=174
[14:01:14] <Woet> Anticom: and re-code that so it generates the graph every second with new ajax data
[14:01:26] <insign> ?api string
[14:01:33] <Anticom> so how do i have to format the returned data?
[14:01:38] <Woet> Anticom: then fail to get it to work, scream, then put your code on pastebin and we go from there :)
[14:01:39] <Anticom> does it have to be JSON?
[14:01:46] <jdee> r3v3rb, neither is she :-)
[14:01:56] <Woet> that ajax example is great and shows how to achieve it, Anticom
[14:01:57] <Anticom> kay Woet i'll give it another try
[14:02:16] <Anticom> Woet: btw that was my first attempt: http://pastebin.com/bbFJB323
[14:02:24] <r3v3rb> jdee, nice send her over
[14:02:46] <insign> jquery has string functions?
[14:02:51] <Kambfhase> freeceiling: what does the accordions active parameter do?
[14:03:18] <kborchers> freeceiling: that is because your 0 is resolving to false in this case which tells active to not open any panes
[14:03:59] <freeceiling> kambfhase: the page has an accordion with three "entries". a # with 0-x should open the appropriate entry of it. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, etc.
[14:04:06] <bobbobbins> hey, im using high charts and i'd like my xaxis labels to be above the graph: http://jsfiddle.net/Mtp4Y/722/
[14:04:12] <bobbobbins> anyone know what i need to do?
[14:04:45] <kborchers> freeceiling: change if(!getacc_id) {getacc_id = false;} to if(!getacc_id && getacc_id !== 0) {getacc_id = false;}
[14:05:12] <insign> I don't want be offensive but I still asking me why I use jquery instead mootools in this project
[14:05:13] <freeceiling> kborchers: I was just about to ask how I should rewrite it *g*
[14:05:50] <mastafrog> hello, does anyone know if there is a way to loop .replaceWoth(), so the new object can also replece it self with the first one?
[14:06:11] <djQuery> paul_irish: awww sad panda
[14:06:30] <mastafrog> .replaceWith()
[14:06:44] <samuelcole> hey guys, question: has anybody had issues with appending html5 elements ('section', for example) and having them be unstyled? yes, i'm using the shiv
[14:07:07] <Kambfhase> Sad panda doesn't like 404's
[14:07:19] <djQuery> samuelcole: yes. specialy in ie
[14:08:18] <samuelcole> i'm also not seeing them in the dom inspector
[14:08:33] <samuelcole> but they appear on the page (though, unstyled)
[14:08:42] <freeceiling> kborchers: mh, isn't working as expected. e.g. If I don't provide the hash after the slash it opens the page with the first accordion open.
[14:09:29] <djQuery> samuelcole: what if you apply a style to them after you add them to the doc
[14:09:31] <timmywil_> samuelcole: it's not yet supported, see http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485
[14:09:40] <kborchers> freeceiling: that is because that is the default functionality for accordion
[14:09:49] <samuelcole> thanks, timmywil_
[14:09:52] <r3v3rb> thanks guys
[14:09:57] <timmywil_> samuelcole: np
[14:10:44] <freeceiling> kborchers: yeah, but the trick is, all accordion entries should be closed if not #<number> is used in the url
[14:11:54] <kborchers> freeceiling: what is getacc_id when you leave off the hash?
[14:12:11] <mastafrog> ?? checkbox = $(document.createElement('input')).click(function(){ obj = obj.replaceWith(img);}); where is img is the same as checkbox. But something doest work right. It stops after one full loop
[14:12:14] <kborchers> freeceiling: console.log it after the if
[14:13:03] <mastafrog> what did I done wrong?
[14:17:12] <albertosheinfeld> Is the best way to add some variable value on a bunch of div elements to add a rel attribute??
[14:17:26] <albertosheinfeld> isn't there a way to just assign a variable to that javascript object?
[14:17:33] <uzsolt> Hi all!
[14:17:48] <uzsolt> I'm a beginner in jquery-ui and I need some help.
[14:18:00] <mastafrog> member:albertosheinfeld just try it =)
[14:18:00] <uzsolt> I want to use Tabs (jquery-ui).
[14:18:13] <uzsolt> It works well, but I need some plus(?).
[14:18:14] <albertosheinfeld> not working masta! :(
[14:18:31] <kborchers> albertosheinfeld: you could use any named attribute you want, also check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[14:18:38] <uzsolt> In tabs I have a table and each row there is an "Edit" button.
[14:18:43] <albertosheinfeld> thanks!
[14:18:52] <uzsolt> So when I click "Edit", I want to load a webpage.
[14:19:09] <uzsolt> When I try: $("#tabs").load("cabstract/add?target=" + table + "&id=" + id);
[14:19:24] <uzsolt> It displays only the form.
[14:19:42] <uzsolt> s/add/modify
[14:19:44] <kborchers> freeceiling: console.log it after the if, then check your console or firebug
[14:20:13] <uzsolt> It displays the form in a Tabs-like border but the tabs disappear...
[14:20:23] <uzsolt> Can anybody help, where is my tabs? :)
[14:20:30] <albertosheinfeld> Data worked perfectly, thanks kborchers
[14:20:35] <kborchers> np
[14:20:35] <uzsolt> What is my fault?
[14:22:02] <uzsolt> The $("#tabs")... is clickEvent of EditButtons (with correct 'table' and 'id' parameters).
[14:22:07] <uzsolt> Anybody?
[14:22:23] <uzsolt> What information do you need?
[14:24:58] <abjorn> I gave tech support to the owner of kkk.org today. So, uh...yeah, that happened.
[14:25:55] <kborchers> abjorn: did you tell them the answer was on naacp.org? ;)
[14:26:01] <Anticom> Woet: okay i thought it might be better to understand jq ajax first in detail, before starting plotting charts: http://pastebin.com/duxjRc1F what's wrong about that code?
[14:26:11] <abjorn> kborchers: lol no in fact I did not
[14:29:10] <abjorn> his opening question said his primary domain was kkk.org and I was like ohboyherewego but...nope...nothing significant happened
[14:29:35] <kborchers> still, had to be an interesting experience
[14:30:11] <abjorn> lol well it did put me back a bit
[14:30:15] <abjorn> kinda did a double take lol
[14:31:14] <kborchers> freeceiling: gotta go, i may be on later, if not, probably all day tomorrow. good luck
[14:31:35] <Anticom> Woet: okay i debugged it roughly but firebug console is telling me that the function update() was not defined although i recognized, that i forgott the function keyword >>silly me<<
[14:32:02] <Woet> Anticom: i'll just ignore you for 15 minutes so you get all issues resolved by yourself :P
[14:32:14] <freeceiling> bye kborchers
[14:32:14] <Anticom> =(
[14:32:24] <Woet> Anticom: that's good! you are learning
[14:33:00] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/dx6wrCEK aptana is showing me no more erros now
[14:33:20] <Anticom> but i can't figure out why i should not have defined the function update()
[14:43:48] <WarDekar> I know this is probably really easy to do but I'm unsure how to do it... I have a form on my page and when the user submits it it sends a request, during the request I want it to just have an hourglass or w/e, then when it gets a response i don't want to change pages I just want to switch which Div is currently visible
[14:45:15] <Vaerros> WarDekar: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:45:38] <Vaerros> you could show the hourglass right before calling that, then remove it in the success callback
[14:45:47] <Vaerros> or w/e
[14:46:01] <mindrape> WarDekar - let me whip you up some sample code...
[14:48:22] <mindrape> $('#result').show('show');   $('#result').html('<img src="loading.gif">');    $.post('results.php', $('#form').serialize(), function(data) { $('#result').html(data); });
[14:48:41] <mindrape> that will show a hidden div called result and display a loading.gif while your php is getting processed...
[14:49:02] <mindrape> then it posts the results of your form to results.php and overwrites the #result div with it's contents
[14:49:23] <WarDekar> mindrape: awesome, thanks!
[14:51:08] <Anticom> Woet: okay got the tricky part now... http://anticom.dyndns.org/jqueryTests/ramusage/simple.html i'm just wondering, why the hell my serverload is not changing, although i'm running all kinds of fancy scripts
[14:51:37] <thomaschaaf_> is there a plugin which does something along the lines of http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5910/Jing/2011-06-27_2343.png ? I really don't want a popup thing but would rather have it inline
[14:51:43] <mindrape> Anticom - server load?  What are you using for the basis?  top?
[14:51:57] <Anticom> what basis? what top?!
[14:52:02] <Anticom> don't get your point
[14:52:04] <Woet> Anticom: use setTimeout inside the success callback instead of setInterval
[14:52:23] <Woet> Anticom: and add console.log to see whether it's actually refreshing every 500 ms
[14:52:35] <Anticom> it is
[14:52:36] <Anticom> firebug tells me ;)
[14:52:49] <Woet> okay, then your php script gives the same output
[14:52:58] <Anticom> script is fireing request every 0.5 sec
[14:53:08] <Woet> still
[14:53:08] <Woet> [23:52:03] <Woet> Anticom: use setTimeout inside the success callback instead of setInterval
[14:53:11] <mindrape> Anticom - if it's a linux server i thought you were referring to the load averages resulting from the top command..
[14:53:35] <Anticom> mindrape: simply using php's memory_usage(true) function (=
[14:54:23] <Anticom> Woet: still got your page open?
[14:54:27] <impi> hey guysand girls, i would like to use jquery tools tooltip with hoverintent, as i am using it in a calendar..which have loads of tooltips, i have thought to use it with the api, and the ,show() and.hide() and have written this code, but it said the api is undefined, can you please give me some advice? here is my code, http://pastebin.com/6E5UdA8Z thank you in advance,
[14:54:31] <Anticom> or better to say my page
[14:54:35] <Woet> no, Anticom
[14:54:50] <Woet> but it doesn't matter - i believe you
[14:54:52] <Woet> [23:52:49] <Woet> okay, then your php script gives the same output
[14:55:19] <Anticom> Woet: that's what i was thinking about, but php is the wrong topic for that chan (=
[14:56:22] <Woet> Anticom: echo shell_exec("free -b | grep buffers/cache | awk -F ' ' '{print $4}'");
[14:56:57] <Woet> print $3 for used bytes, print $4 for free bytes
[14:57:08] <Anticom> wow
[14:57:21] <Anticom> and it's no kind of forkbomb or something? :D
[14:58:15] <Anticom> Woet: output is empty
[14:58:23] <Anticom> for $4 AND $3
[14:58:36] <Woet> Anticom: debian? ubuntu? centos? pastebin your output of just 'free -b'
[14:58:51] <bro-bot> /me wiggles
[14:59:21] <ejo> Hi.  Is there a general answer to why sometimes Firefox 5 renders my animations in a jerky way as if system resources are kind of strained, even when all my cores are practically unloaded?  This is on a nearly clean Ubuntu installation so no Windows runaway background processes b.s. affecting the situation...
[14:59:36] <Anticom> Woet: windows :)
[14:59:37] <Anticom> :D
[14:59:59] <Woet> Anticom: oh, nvm then - i don't do sucky OSes
[15:00:17] <Anticom> btw, found the error in my php script: it's got to be memory_get_usage(FALSE) (which is default)
[15:00:28] <ejo> I've found that if I shut down and restart FF it will work smoothly again.  D'ya think it's just memory leaks and other sloppy stuff in Firefox?
[15:00:47] <bro-bot> ejo: because firefox 5 is buggy as all hell
[15:00:54] <Woet> Anticom: that shows the memory allocated to PHP, not the server
[15:00:55] <Anticom> Woet: my webpack is running on linux, and i've got a ubuntu partitition on my laptop as well (=
[15:00:58] <ejo> The animation in question is simple... just allowing a click to cause a not-very-complex div to animate across the screen to another position.
[15:01:07] <Woet> Anticom: unless you are interested in showing the memory usage of the script showing the memory usage..
[15:01:16] <Anticom> Woet: i want to get the actual usage of memory
[15:01:17] <ejo> bro-bot: I believe it.  I was hoping they would have left that at 4
[15:01:20] <Anticom> used by php
[15:01:28] <Anticom> and that's what i'm getting, am i not?
[15:01:32] <Woet> Anticom: so you want to know how much memory the getRAM.php script uses?
[15:01:38] <Anticom> no
[15:01:40] <Anticom> php.exe
[15:01:44] <Woet> that won't work
[15:01:49] <Anticom> doh
[15:01:52] <Woet> php is not a daemon.
[15:01:53] <ejo> someone said php: there's your problem!
[15:02:03] <Anticom> ejo:  :P
[15:02:05] <Woet> memory_get_usage does not show your usage of all PHP scripts
[15:02:07] <Ludger> I know, it is not jquery, but has here anyone some experience with ARC2/SPARQL?
[15:02:07] * ejo ducks
[15:02:21] <mindrape> ejo - you prefer perl?
[15:02:30] <Anticom> Woet: even with param = true?
[15:02:32] <ejo> rofl
[15:02:38] <Woet> Anticom: read the docs.
[15:02:44] <abjorn> as if perl is the only other option
[15:02:46] <Woet> so you know what the function and the actual parameters do
[15:02:49] <Anticom> don't get that emalloc() stuff
[15:03:03] <mindrape> abjorn - in the open source world which dominates freenode... basically...
[15:03:05] <Anticom> i'm native german and even the german version of the doc is written in english partialy
[15:03:17] <abjorn> mindrape: I guess you've never heard of Ruby.
[15:03:28] <Woet> so what? i'm native dutch, 'currently being allocated to your PHP script.' makes sense to me.
[15:03:28] <mindrape> Ruby is useless... as is python.
[15:03:32] <ejo> actually, if php and perl were in a room together and nothing else, I would smite php with a 20 pound sledgehammer, multiple times, and have a nice dinner with perl.  But I'm a python guy.
[15:03:36] <ejo> and/or java
[15:03:38] <abjorn> You, sir, don't know what you are talking about!
[15:03:41] <Anticom> ejo prefers cgi :D
[15:03:58] <abjorn> cgi php lol
[15:04:03] <Anticom> ftw
[15:04:04] <ejo> yep, all cgi here, I'm working on my Apple ][ assembly language port of jQuery this weekend
[15:04:13] <mindrape> if you are using ruby for ANYTHING production you are a tard.
[15:04:16] <abjorn> that sounds like the worst idea of all time
[15:04:17] <ejo> it's going to be 0.37% faster
[15:04:31] <abjorn> mindrape confirmed for not knowin nuttin bout ruby
[15:04:49] <mindrape> abjorn - just cuz your a ruby fanboy doesn't mean it's good for anything useful :)
[15:04:53] <abjorn> I'm not
[15:04:56] <abjorn> I don't even use Ruby haha
[15:04:57] <ejo> there's a pretty vast difference between "production for Bank of America" and "production for reddit.com"
[15:05:06] <mindrape> perl > python > php > bash > everything else > ruby
[15:05:12] <ejo> remember ruby != rails... it was rails that blew chunks
[15:05:19] <abjorn> But there's so many successful Ruby on Rails applications that your entire statement is ignorant
[15:05:56] <abjorn> I choose not to use Ruby because it's just not to my liking, but I would never say that using it in production is a poor choice - many people do it and do it rather successfully.
[15:06:11] <mindrape> probably in a small business of less than 50 employees...
[15:06:13] <__sephiroth> howdy friends. the custom downloader at http://jqueryui.com/download appears to be cutting the file transfer after the 1st chunk
[15:06:33] <__sephiroth> ~66k
[15:06:57] <abjorn> Yeah, okay, mindrape, because' it's not like basecamp, twitter, github, and groupon are very successful or anything
[15:07:09] <abjorn> lol
[15:09:09] <mindrape> abjorn - and I assume you've looked into their infrastructure and seen their scaling woes?
[15:09:44] <abjorn> Okay, and what massively successful website isn't going to have scaling woes? Certain PHP and Perl applications will.
[15:09:58] <abjorn> As will a web application written in...fuckin anything, really lol
[15:10:11] <mindrape> abjorn.glib++;
[15:10:16] <abjorn> Even something intended to be easy to scale, like Node, would have issues with that kind of load
[15:11:16] * kimico Miauuuuuu online
[15:11:42] <__sephiroth> do we have a jquery UI op around?
[15:11:55] <abjorn> uhh ajpiano might be here
[15:12:06] <abjorn> should check #jqueryui tho
[15:12:31] <abjorn> time to go get some FOOD
[15:12:31] <__sephiroth> oic - didn't know it was a separate channel. thanks
[15:12:58] <xxiao> a dumb question, what's the difference between "id" and "class"?
[15:13:05] <ejo> is github still on Ruby?
[15:13:21] <abjorn> yeah
[15:13:30] <mindrape> xxiao - #id .class
[15:13:31] <ejo> thx
[15:13:33] <abjorn> xxiao: No such thing as a dumb question.
[15:13:40] <abjorn> ID is unique per element
[15:13:42] <abjorn> Class isn't
[15:14:03] <xxiao> abjorn: got it, thanks
[15:19:15] <xxiao> abjorn: for all p elements in a html/js the id must have only one presense right? i.e. can not use the same id for all the p elements in a file?
[15:19:38] <xxiao> abjorn: for class i can have multiple p use the same name?
[15:19:47] <ryanneufeld> xxiao: yes
[15:20:11] <xxiao> guess i found a bug then, as the same id was used twice in two div
[15:20:23] * xxiao is new to jquery/js
[15:21:52] <albertosheinfeld> Is there a way to do on the hover (OUT) callback not to be called if i hover over 1 element??
[15:22:07] <albertosheinfeld> i mean, i want it to be called ALWAYS except if i'm on top of another element...
[15:23:10] <asdasd> no man
[15:23:22] <asdasd> who said
[15:23:27] <asdasd> ???
[15:23:32] <asdasd> alooo
[15:23:47] <asdasd> Ser????
[15:23:55] <asdasd> anybody????
[15:24:00] <kborchers> albertosheinfeld: do you have some code we can see?
[15:24:09] <albertosheinfeld> sure
[15:24:13] <kborchers> asdasd: if you have a question, ask
[15:24:21] <asdasd> yes I have many code
[15:24:26] <asdasd> cool
[15:24:42] <asdasd> ok i have problem
[15:25:24] <albertosheinfeld> whats the best way to paste my code here
[15:25:25] <albertosheinfeld> ?
[15:25:32] <asdasd> i want to create pop up fpr form where just have to show missing fields
[15:25:32] <kborchers> http://jsfiddle.net
[15:25:36] <albertosheinfeld> i know thereok
[15:25:54] <asdasd> do you have any excemple
[15:26:22] <asdasd> alloooo
[15:26:36] <kborchers> asdasd: hmm, if i am understanding you correctly, check out http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[15:26:58] <albertosheinfeld> here it is kbochers
[15:26:59] <albertosheinfeld> http://jsfiddle.net/STB9b/
[15:27:30] <albertosheinfeld> the idea is that if i am over the new div i added, then don't call the callback of hoverOut
[15:27:54] <asdasd> no no it will be like second form but popup with missing fields
[15:28:22] <kborchers> asdasd: oh, i see. don't know of anything like that.
[15:28:26] <kborchers> sorry
[15:28:53] <asdasd> and how I can do it any idea??
[15:30:51] <d4rklit3> what is the importance of <ul> and <li> tags
[15:31:02] <d4rklit3> are they block elements like <div> and <h#>
[15:31:13] <skamikaze> d4rklit3: #html
[15:31:19] <d4rklit3> i don
[15:31:23] <d4rklit3> wanna.. too many irc channels

[15:32:06] <behruz> hi guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[15:32:12] <behruz> i'm new here
[15:32:33] <behruz> i can help if any quest
[15:32:59] <albertosheinfeld> any idea kborchers?
[15:33:02] <rns> how can I update multiple things via ajax?
[15:33:15] <japherwocky> rns: what kind of thing?
[15:33:29] <rns> japherwocky, an html table and several formsets
[15:33:51] <behruz> how?? just explane
[15:33:54] <kborchers> albertosheinfeld: hmmm, so it fires even though you are still over img?
[15:34:06] <behruz> i don't undestand you man
[15:34:13] <japherwocky> rns: you can do it manually or look at something like backbone
[15:34:31] <albertosheinfeld> no, it fires when i hover over the div i created, that's on top of the image
[15:34:39] <behruz> now how i can put my code here
[15:34:47] <behruz> i didn't fined
[15:34:50] <albertosheinfeld> maybe i can remove all elements on hover, create them and just remove them on hover over the body?
[15:35:01] <rns> japherwocky, how would I do it manually?
[15:35:01] <behruz> here cool man i like it
[15:35:03] <albertosheinfeld> but i want an efficient solution...
[15:35:37] <behruz> just wait for me i'm doing i can show you
[15:35:44] <behruz> in 10 20 minits
[15:35:52] <kborchers> albertosheinfeld: right, hmmm. you might want to scrap hover and try using mouseenter and mouseout. i think mouseout should not fire until you actually leave the div even if you are over something inside
[15:35:55] <japherwocky> rns: you use something like $.post() which has a callback that gets passed the server response
[15:36:17] <japherwocky> and in that callback you read the response and change the values with something like $.val()
[15:36:53] <albertosheinfeld> wow
[15:36:54] <albertosheinfeld> ok
[15:36:54] <rns> japherwocky, how can I seperate out the values in the response to differentiate among the html table and different formsets?
[15:36:58] <albertosheinfeld> will try that
[15:37:00] <albertosheinfeld> thanks man
[15:37:30] <japherwocky> rns: your server could return a json dict with {key:value,}
[15:37:50] <kborchers> albertosheinfeld: don't thank me until it works. ;) i haven't tested that solution
[15:38:07] <JordiGH> jQuery isn't magical, is it? If I do var foo = ("#bar"); $("#bar").append("<p>lol</p>");, then foo won't reflect the change, will it?
[15:38:53] <rns> japherwocky, okay I can do that on the serverside, but then what would the jquery look like?
[15:39:13] <skamikaze> JordiGH: as  var foo = ("#bar"); is no jQuery object you will never find out ;D
[15:39:23] <zekeweeks> I've got a bug I can't figure out for the life of me... my <img> elements get stripped out on this one page in FF/Chrome only, but none of the others using the same exact script: http://new.onetribecreative.com/ver2/advertising.htm (Code: http://jsfiddle.net/mFS8t/ - Page without the error: http://new.onetribecreative.com/ver2/casestudies.htm )
[15:39:27] <JordiGH> Eh.
[15:39:37] <JordiGH> foo = $("#bar");
[15:39:44] <skamikaze> JordiGH: it chains the object so you don't get a result returned if that's the question
[15:40:21] <ajpiano> JordiGH: if you add something to that dom element, and still have a reference to that element, yes, you have a reference to the element with updated contents
[15:40:51] <japherwocky> rns: $.get('/yourservice', function (data) { alert(data)} )
[15:40:57] <JordiGH> Ah $("#stuff") returns a reference, not a copy?
[15:41:07] <JordiGH> So jQuery *is* magical.
[15:41:32] <ajpiano> that is definitely not magical
[15:42:07] <gnarf> jQuery returns unicorns
[15:42:37] <mindrape> magnets = magical.
[15:47:55] <kborchers> gnarf: thanks, i needed a good laugh :D
[15:50:43] <zamba> i need an input box for entering stop clock times in hours, minutes and seconds.. what's the best widget for that?
[15:51:13] <rns> japherwocky, any way you could provide me with a full example?
[15:51:18] <zamba> basically entering values like 54h 23m 2s
[15:51:23] <zamba> but want to make it easier for the user
[15:54:47] <__sephiroth> question about jquery ui theming
[15:54:50] <orolo> i need to bail out of the .hover() function so if a mouse hovers in and then 'click's; i need to disable the second function( mouseout) .
[15:54:51] <orolo> ?
[15:55:40] <coldhead> zamba: http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[15:55:40] <coldhead> something like that perhaps
[15:56:05] <__sephiroth> when i select 'No theme' the resulting jquery.ui.theme.css still references a few bg images, is there any way to have the generator remove that completely? or do i just deal with it by removing the url()'s myself?
[16:06:05] <MrSoundless> hey guys, I got a table and when I click one of the td's in it I want the next row to become visible
[16:06:09] <MrSoundless> how would I do this
[16:06:53] <MrSoundless> so so table has 2 rows, row1 and row2    td in row1 is clicked, row2 becomes visible
[16:16:46] <techdev> Hey all, I'm looking for someone who knows something about a jquery plugin called dataTables
[16:22:53] <choffstein> Hey all.  Quick question.  I am rendering a page within an iframe and that page has some javascript code associated with it.  Is it possible to use jquery to call that code on the inner iframe from the outer page?
[16:24:09] <techdev> I think you should be able to. I'm not certain because I don't know iframes very well, but I think they are supposed to be compatible with everything that goes on outside them on the main page
[16:25:22] <choffstein> so let's say I have parent_page and inner_page.  inner_page defines some javascript function.  Is there any way to call that javascript function from parent_page?\
[16:25:43] <z1000> http://pastie.org/2131625 any ideas why this might not work?
[16:25:48] <z1000> does closest work for sibling elements?
[16:25:53] <WarDekar> i'm having trouble with doing an ajax form that doesn't reload the page, and I really have no idea what's going wrong
[16:26:27] <erichynds> z1000: closest is anscestors. you may want siblings()
[16:26:36] <techdev> Ah, so you want to write the js in the inner page, then reference that function from jquery on the parent page?
[16:27:13] <choffstein> yeah
[16:27:20] <techdev> choffstein: again ,might be possible, but you would probably have to reference the iframe, then grab its elements in jquery
[16:27:20] <choffstein> seems ... not likely possible
[16:27:40] <choffstein> techdev: that's what I am trying to do... but I don't know how to reference the script itself.
[16:28:16] <z1000> worked thanks
[16:28:18] <erichynds> sure you can
[16:28:20] <techdev> choffstein: you would probably be better off writing jquery to do what your pure javascript is doing now, and referencing the iframe as an html element and manipulating it on the parent page
[16:28:37] <erichynds> iframe.contentWindow will give you the window object of the iframe
[16:28:47] <techdev> choffstein: does that make sense?
[16:28:49] <choffstein> techdev: the iframe is embedding a google map...
[16:28:59] <choffstein> techdev: makes total sense...just don't think I can necessarily do it.
[16:29:01] <erichynds> assuming that's where you've namespaced your stuff, you should be able to access it there
[16:29:21] <techdev> ^
[16:29:45] <choffstein> erichynds: $("#iframe_id").contentWindow ?
[16:29:48] <techdev> Maybe check out some documentation on embedding google maps
[16:29:58] <techdev> in case there's some special syntax
[16:30:04] <erichynds> choffstein $('#iframe')[0].contentWindow
[16:30:26] <choffstein> legend.
[16:32:32] <techdev> I'm having some jquery trouble myself, but it relates to a plugin called DataTables. Has anyone used this plugin before?
[16:32:57] <z1000> this cant work? 			$(this).parent().animate({'backgroundColor' : '#333'}, 501);
[16:33:07] <z1000> installed color plugin seems like should work
[16:34:26] <z1000> ahh needs default bg color set in css
[16:35:04] <techdev> Specifically, I am having trouble with options to show table manipulation buttons in the table toobar
[16:35:51] <techdev> I have declared serveral options to show up in the toolbar in my $(#table).dataTable ( {
[16:36:06] <techdev> but only a max of two show up, and others overwrite the old ones
[16:36:15] <techdev> Does anyone know why this might happen?
[16:40:06] <choffstein> well, I thought this would be easy.  I was very, very wrong.
[16:40:32] <coldhead> nothing is easy
[16:40:36] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[16:42:30] <techdev> tell me about it. I've been stuck on this plugin issue for awhile now
[16:44:31] <choffstein> okay.  hmmm.  maybe what i am trying to do actually isn't possible.
[16:45:04] <choffstein> let's say in a.html, I have a javascript function a().  I embed a.html in b.html with an iframe.  from b.html, can I call a() using jquery?
[16:45:19] <choffstein> because my javascript console doesn't seem to want to let me :D
[16:45:30] <techdev> choffstein: did you find some documentation that said that, or are you just giving up?
[16:45:51] <choffstein> more like ... lack of documentation :D
[16:45:54] <techdev> Try giving it a break for awhile, you might think clearer if you come back to it
[16:45:57] <choffstein> and the end of a 12 hour day ;)
[16:46:59] <techdev> That's why i'm glad life isn't like a video game sometimes: You can always find a different path of progression, instead of being stuck on a linear one
[16:47:22] <choffstein> very true.
[16:47:26] <choffstein> might be dinner time...
[16:47:32] <beasty> mm
[16:47:35] <beasty> can't i do this ?
[16:47:38] <beasty> $('#RGlzYWJsZWQ=').change(function() { alert($(this).val()); });
[16:48:55] <mgd> yeah!!! i'm here
[16:49:08] <mgd> just trying to find this ir c channel
[16:49:36] <erichynds> hi
[16:50:00] <mgd> hi
[16:50:11] <Veebers> Hi All, trying to make a minor typo fix on the docs page but there is no option to create an account only to log in? Am I looking in the wrong place?
[16:51:16] <erichynds> Veebers: yeah, it's not a public wiki
[16:51:23] <erichynds> file a ticket
[16:51:40] <techdev> think i'm out for today. Goodluck choffstein
[16:52:45] <Veebers> erichynds: Ah ok, makes sense :) is it work filing a ticket for a minor typo? (i.e. the ; is at the end of the comment, not the code itself . . .)
[16:53:02] <erichynds> sure
[16:53:42] <Veebers> Cool, will look into that then. Cheers for the help
[16:54:08] <tuchongo> hi i am looking for a plugin with gantt chart
[16:57:07] <beasty> this is soo weird
[17:00:18] <freedrull> i set the "action" attr of a form to a string, but when i do form.submit() its not using that string
[17:01:55] <tuchongo> need some help to find a gantt chart plugin
[17:03:10] <tucan> Hi, I am currently using jQuery UI for an autocomplete feature. A list of words is retrieved by the backend Perl script.  I need a flag to be passed from jQuery to the backend. This flag indicates what option is chosen from a select box. Every time the user chooses a different option in select box, I need to pass a different flag so that the backend executes another SQL statement.  The backend isn't important. I need someone that that k
[17:03:43] <tucan> can anyone help me that
[17:04:52] <freedrull> tucan: get the attribute of the select box, add a flag to the form submit action based on that?
[17:05:09] <ajpiano> tucan, you can use the "source" option of autocomplete with a function
[17:05:15] <ajpiano> which will allow you to roll the ajax yourself
[17:05:21] <ajpiano> instead of doing the built-in ajax
[17:05:27] <ajpiano> and that is how you can send an additional parameter
[17:05:28] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[17:05:34] <ajpiano> is an example of how it is done
[17:07:00] <T-Gunn> does img have a click event? $("img.className").click(function{});  ?
[17:08:21] <tucan> ajopiano, could you give me a full example?   i managed to get autocomplete to work for just a textbox but when select box is involved im lost
[17:10:30] <ajpiano> yup
[17:10:31] <T-Gunn> $(function(){alert("BOO");}); should give me a popup box on page load, right?
[17:10:31] <ajpiano> yes
[17:10:35] <T-Gunn> ok, thanks, so my syntax is correct but for some reason one of my pages isnt running javascript .. i know javascript is enabled becuse i just tested another page using jquery too and it works fine =\ very weird
[17:14:56] <tucan> ajpiano: basically whenever user selects a different option from select box, it needs to send a different value to backend, i was hoping you could provide a demo with select box
[17:15:26] <ajpiano> you already have an implementation of the ui autocomplete, just not sending the extra data?
[17:15:28] <ajpiano> please paste it
[17:15:32] <ajpiano> in a pastebin, not here
[17:15:38] <tucan> ok
[17:18:55] <freedrull> setting the 'action' attribute of a form doesnt seem to affect the post data
[17:19:20] <ajpiano> freedrull: please create a live demo of your problem on jsfiddle.net
[17:19:49] <freedrull> ok that sounds fun
[17:22:13] <tucan> ajpiano: i pasted it here http://pastebin.com/mF8ju95M
[17:22:58] <tucan> ajpiano, please help me send the extra data whether select box is onchange
[17:23:17] <tucan> *when
[17:23:46] <ajpiano> you want to send a query string value like "searchtype=english" along with your search?
[17:24:10] <tucan> ajpiano: yes, basically
[17:24:56] <anli_> Is there a way to get the value of a :radio?
[17:25:06] <anli_> I tried element.val()
[17:27:52] <ajpiano> tucan: this might not work as is, but shows you the approach you have to take
[17:27:54] <ajpiano> http://pastebin.com/URqpb8jX
[17:28:00] <ajpiano> sorry for the formatting, pastebin.com sucks
[17:28:28] <ElGoorf> anli, tried .checked
[17:30:51] <anli_> Strange, I set a value of the radios in the html as value="foo", but when I check those values in firebug, they value=""
[17:30:53] <anli_> empty strings
[17:38:13] * lazyPower yawns o/ everyone.
[17:39:03] <lazyPower> anli_: $('input[name=radio-name]').val(); -- with this method you have to give yooour radios a name= property.
[17:39:42] <FelicianoX> a
[17:40:06] <anli_> I had to add a property data-value to the radios
[17:40:19] <anli_> They did not become ""
[17:46:41] <ben_alman> wat
[17:46:58] <GoddeR> O;
[17:57:28] <tucan> ajpiano: it's working thanks
[17:58:32] <saddishwasher> hey all
[18:19:15] <tucan> ajpiano: are you still there?

[18:31:07] <supsup> question:  can you use delegate to just trigger when a new div with class is added to dom or do you have to pass it some event also....in this case should I just use live?
[18:36:15] <kborchers> supsup: what exactly are you trying to accomplish when the div is added?
[18:36:49] <supsup> add a tooltip on mouseover
[18:37:26] <tuchongo> @plugin gantt
[18:38:00] <kborchers> supsup: so you need to bind the mouseover event on that new div? then i believe live is what you want
[18:38:25] <supsup> yah trying otu live it appears to work
[18:38:48] <tucan> the autocomplete dropdown seems to be too narrow to fit my words and it's breaking to next line, how can make it wider?
[18:39:05] <tucan> (using jquery ui)
[18:40:43] <kborchers> tucan: hmmm, autocomplete should expand to the width of your content as long as it has room to expand. do you have a link or example you can show us of the issue?
[18:41:49] <supsup> Kborchers is there anyway to attach tooltip event as soon as the div with class is loaded instead of having to wait for an event to happen?
[18:42:03] <supsup> can the event be the addition of the div?
[18:42:30] <tucan> kborchers: can i pm the link?
[18:43:21] <kborchers> supsup: no, the dom change is not an event, unfortunately. why don't you just do a bind at the same time the div is added?
[18:43:58] <kborchers> tucan: any reason you can't just paste it here? PM's prevent others from learning.
[18:43:59] <supsup> ah yah
[18:44:30] <tucan> kborchers: ok
[18:44:40] <tucan> kborchers: it's http://www.koreandictionary.net/
[18:45:23] <tucan> kborchers: please select Pronunciation from select box and enter sa lang in textbox
[18:45:32] <supsup> good call kborchers...i tried 'load' heh
[18:45:36] <tucan> one of the phrases breaks to next line
[18:46:02] <kborchers> tucan: i don't see the break. what browser?
[18:46:18] <tucan> kborchers: firefox
[18:46:41] <kborchers> tucan: ok, i was using chrome. one sec
[18:47:03] <tucan> kborchers: the last phrase on the list is sa lang seu lu oon
[18:47:40] <kborchers> tucan: hmmm, it does wrap in FF. ok, let me take a look
[18:55:18] <kborchers> tucan: i can't seem to find a reason for this. it seems that the ul is 1 pixel to small. this may be a bug in autocomplete. probably not the answer you wanted. please file it at bugs.jqueryui.com
[18:55:32] <tucan> kborchers: sure
[18:56:54] <tucan> one other question i have is for minLength, I sort of want it to be different based on what option is chosen by select box
[18:56:59] <tucan> is that possible?
[18:57:07] <freedrull> are query strings ignored if they are appended to an "action" attribute of a form???
[18:58:44] <freedrull> this seems like the wrong way to do it, there should be input fields that are modified instead, even if they are hidden, its better than just modifying the "action" attribute
[19:00:26] <kborchers> tucan: sure, bind the change event of the selectbox and update the minLength option in that function. make sense?
[19:01:34] <tucan> kborchers: hmm could you give me the line, sorta new to jquery
[19:01:39] <kborchers> freedrull: browsers are inconsistent there. i believe ie ignores them.
[19:06:16] <kborchers> tucan: not a complete solution and the id's i use are examples but should get you started. http://jsfiddle.net/bkEKc/
[19:10:34] <tucan> kborchers: thanks

[19:31:53] <caro> hi
[19:32:30] <caro> anyone?
[19:32:44] <caro> I need help with jquery datepicker
[19:32:50] <kborchers> caro: if you have a question, just ask
[19:33:26] <tucan> kborchers: i submitted the bug report for the text wrap issue in firefox, i hope it can be resolved someday
[19:34:21] <caro> ok Im using datepicker and I need to change the color of the selected date but it seems like the default state always overwrite the class that I created
[19:36:02] <kborchers> caro: why don't you just change the css?
[19:36:20] <caro> look I did this
[19:36:34] <caro> var result = ( typeof(activeDates[dateAsString]) == "undefined" ) ? [false] : [true, 'selected-day'];
[19:36:56] <caro> that is in the function beforeshowDay
[19:37:21] <caro> .selected-day {      border: 1px solid #035190 !important;   color: #000000 !important;   background-color: #035190 !important;  }  .selected-day a {       color: #000000 !important;   opacity: 0.5 !important;  }
[19:37:30] <caro> an then in the css I did that
[19:38:12] <caro> but his class is overwritten by ui-defaul-state
[19:39:43] <kborchers> ok, but why don' t you just modify ui-default-state?
[19:39:54] <pyite_mac> why hello... I am using jQuery tmpl(), but I don't think this question relates to tmpl() specifically. I'm trying to find a safe way to access an object such as data.callerid.number where data and/or callerid might be null. Right now it errors out. I don't want to have to wrap each statement in a big long if, as I use this all the time. Is there something simple I can do?
[20:03:17] <Greed> Is there a run_once() equivalent for jquery?
[20:03:32] <Chibby_> is anyone here familiar witht he pnotify jqueryui plugin and knows how to change the position of the hover notice?
[20:03:43] <Greed> Actually
[20:03:45] <Greed> That makes no sense
[20:03:53] <Greed> Because unless it is set to an event, it will only run once.
[20:03:58] <Greed> Nevermind.
[20:05:09] <Chibby_> pyite_mac if you made the object, create accessor methods for the variables so you can do data.callerid.setNumber() and getNumber()
[20:05:23] <Chibby_> and have the ifs inside those
[20:26:47] <Chibby_> sadface
[20:38:41] <imsky> word up
[20:41:50] <Greed> When using .load(), does it append or replace content?
[20:47:27] <Greed> Actually, scratch that.
[20:47:31] <Greed> It replaces.
[21:20:34] <abjorn> unf
[21:21:23] <iszak> I concur
[21:24:40] <sprezzatura> is it possible to get all elements by wildcard. for eg, i want to attach a datepicker object to all elements which have the id as "*reading_date"
[21:25:35] <iszak> ?ends with @ sprezzatura
[21:25:42] <iszak> why do we even bother with bots
[21:25:50] <letterpress> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[21:26:04] <iszak> there we go, letterpress you are not recruited as the bot.
[21:26:06] <iszak> s/not/now/
[21:26:36] <sprezzatura> letterpress: thanks!
[21:27:33] <sprezzatura> love this!
[21:30:35] <sprezzatura> letterpress: same analogy holds good for find by class too? like...get all 'a' elements whose class is delete-row : $('input[class="delete-row"]').  ?
[21:30:47] <sprezzatura> ... $('a[class="delete-row"]').
[21:31:18] <letterpress> i think that you'd normally do simply $("a.delete-row")
[21:32:20] <sprezzatura> letterpress: doesnt seem to work
[21:32:41] <patabugen> I'm not sure you can use hyphens in class names
[21:33:10] <letterpress> i believe you can
[21:34:01] <letterpress> is the .delete-row class applied to the <a> ? or is it on an element inside the <a>?
[21:34:04] <patabugen> Entirely possible
[21:34:14] <sprezzatura> letterpress: applied to 'a'
[21:34:58] <sprezzatura> like : <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="delete-row" style="display: none;">remove</a>
[21:35:23] <sprezzatura> letterpress: i want to make that display as block. so was doing : $("a.delete-row").css({display:'block'});
[21:37:04] <sprezzatura> letterpress: patabugen: ?
[21:37:29] <letterpress> your css method doesn't look right
[21:37:44] <sprezzatura> letterpress: like?
[21:38:47] <Chibby_> the only jquery api is incredibly good and very easy to find things in
[21:38:57] <Chibby_> o:
[21:39:29] <letterpress> no it's fine sprezzatura, http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/uqfEY/1/
[21:39:41] <letterpress> should be working, in other words.
[21:40:34] <sprezzatura> brb
[21:42:49] <sprezzatura> i think its due to the fact that the element is being added dynamically by another js
[21:43:39] <letterpress> so is there a click event involved, hmm?
[21:44:21] <sprezzatura> yes. that element is being added dynamically.
[21:44:47] <sprezzatura> am using jquery.formset
[21:46:10] <sprezzatura> is it possible to capture that event and change when the DOM changes?
[21:46:16] <letterpress> not familiar with that but the problem may be that you need to use .delegate() for the click event.
[21:46:42] <letterpress> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[21:47:31] <letterpress> the "root element" that you attach delegate to just needs to be present at the time it's executed. so for instance a containing table or div.
[21:48:01] <sprezzatura> bugger! there was a bug in the .min file. used the .js file and it worked! need to inform the owner
[21:52:30] <sprezzatura> letterpress: can i use images in jsfiddle?
[21:52:55] <letterpress> sure, if they're accessible on the internet
[21:54:00] <sprezzatura> for eg. can i use datepicker?
[22:09:23] <Ricoshady> if I grab a bunch of classes by $('.my-class') is there a way to grab the first element?
[22:10:54] <farinspace> couldnt you do $('.my-class')[0]
[22:11:31] <Cork> Ricoshady: $('.my-class:first') or $('.my-class').eq(0)
[22:11:31] <farinspace> or $('.my-class').first()
[22:11:48] <Cork> [0] will get the dom element and not the jquery wrapper
[22:12:16] <farinspace> true ... go with $('.my-class:first'), much more elegant
[22:13:49] <farinspace> might have performance considerations using :first ... http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[22:13:56] <hrwath> ?down littlebigdetails.com
[22:14:13] <hrwath> bot-t, no ?down?
[22:14:17] <Cork> hrwath: bots down :)
[22:14:18] <bot-t> hrwath, No results found for 'littlebigdetails.com'.
[22:14:18] <bot-t> hrwath, Outlook not so good.
[22:14:27] <Cork> oh, its back >_>
[22:14:43] <hrwath> but still no ?down ;-)
[22:15:30] <hrwath> Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to downforeveryoneorjustme.com
[22:15:33] <hrwath> damn ;-)
[22:16:00] <Cork> farinspace: its the same for the other options too though
[22:16:13] <Cork> all of them will select all and then grab the first in the array
[22:17:22] <farinspace> Cork: interesting, good to know
[22:18:41] <Cork> farinspace: all :<function> calls work that way, they are extensions to the selector
[22:19:00] <Cork> so first the selector run, then the psedo selector
[22:19:32] <Cork> (its not the same in css though, as far as i know)
[22:20:26] <Chibby_> lol hrwath, if only there were a site that you could go to and check if the site is down for just you or everyone else
[22:22:12] <Cork> Chibby_: you mean like http://www.downornot.com/downforeveryoneorjustme ? :D
[22:22:42] <Chibby_> ahah
[22:24:24] <Cork> hmm
[22:24:29] <Cork> look like they changed domain name
[22:24:30] <hrwath> Chibby_, well... basically ?down was for that
[22:24:34] <Cork> http://downforeveryoneorjustme.org/
[22:25:17] <hrwath> hm, littlebigdetails is up
[22:25:34] <hrwath> I liked it when downforeveryone was down
[22:25:36] <hrwath> ;-)
[22:26:06] <hrwath> up... "We'll be back shurtly"
[22:26:12] <hrwath> up my ass ;-)
[22:26:21] <hrwath> shortly*
[22:28:46] <Nuck> Is there some magic way to buld my form such that it serializes to JSON easily?
[22:42:49] <Patman> does anyone know how to make this possible: cssdom = jQuery('style#stylesheetid').html('#test { }') or .text('#test { }')
[22:45:47] <tbranyen> Patman: use cssText
[22:46:01] <Patman> .cssText() ?
[22:46:02] <tbranyen> jQuery("#stylesheetid")[0].cssText i think
[22:46:08] <Patman> ah ok
[22:47:38] <tbranyen> Patman: although i thought innerHTML worked as well
[22:47:48] <Patman> let me give that a shot first
[22:48:24] <Patman> ah nvm i did try that one and it didnt work for me
[22:48:34] <Patman> it works when creating it, but to update it, it doesnt
[22:48:39] <tbranyen> Patman: oh wait its .styleSheet.cssText
[22:48:44] <tbranyen> nah it should work
[22:49:19] <tbranyen> Patman: i think the most cross browser compat way is to set either styleSheet.cssText and if styleSheet doesn't exist fallback to innerHTML or innerText
[22:49:19] <Patman> cssdom = jQuery('<style>').attr({id: sid,type: "text/css"}).html(css).appendTo(jQuery('head'));
[22:49:34] <Patman> cssdom.html('test');
[22:49:43] <tbranyen> test isn't valid css
[22:50:03] <Patman> right but doesnt change the style tag at all
[22:50:12] <atxq> how can I return the content of an iframe?
[22:50:12] <Patman> it creates it, but doesnt update it
[22:50:23] <tbranyen> Patman: i'm guessing because... its not valid?
[22:50:25] <Patman> @atxq .contents() if its same domain
[22:50:39] <Patman> i tried it with other css aswell
[22:51:15] <Patman> jQuery('#' + sid).html('#myclass { width: 50px; }');
[22:51:40] <atxq> so how can I send content into an iframe?
[22:51:50] <tbranyen> working here Patman
[22:51:55] <tbranyen> fwiw
[22:52:03] <tbranyen> var css = jQuery("<style/>").html("lol").appendTo("body"); console.log( css.html("lol2").html() )
[22:52:06] <tbranyen> lol2
[22:52:22] <Patman> let me try again
[22:54:03] <tbranyen> Patman: hmm it reports it correctly, but checking the dom element reports it unchanged
[22:54:07] <tbranyen> checking my old source code again
[22:54:10] <tbranyen> since i've done this before
[22:54:19] <atxq> is it possible to change text inside an iframe?
[22:54:44] <Patman> atxq http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[22:54:53] <farinspace> only if its local to the domain i think ... youll run into crossdomain issues otherwise
[22:55:05] <Patman> $("#frameDemo").contents().find("a").text('link');
[22:55:17] <atxq> I checked that page already, but in the example it changes the background-color
[22:55:26] <atxq> I want to change text
[22:55:28] <Patman> ya because its settings .css()
[22:55:31] <Patman> use .text instead
[22:55:39] <atxq> so switch .css with .html?
[22:55:39] <Patman> or .html
[22:55:46] <atxq> okay
[22:56:04] <atxq> was having some issues before, wanted to confirm
[22:56:07] <atxq> thanks
[22:56:28] <Patman> tbranyen: do you remember doing it with jquery or just using javascript
[22:57:51] <tbranyen> Patman: https://github.com/tbranyen/LiveEdit-CSS/blob/master/jquery.live-edit.js
[22:57:59] <tbranyen> code is really ugly and unfinished, but i did a lot of testing cross browser
[22:58:06] <tbranyen> to get style editing to work
[22:58:43] <Patman> unfinished, but works for setting the styles?
[22:59:46] <tbranyen> well unfinished in that i wrote it maybe a year ago and i never finished it
[22:59:52] <tbranyen> but it defintely can set styles
[23:00:13] <tbranyen> somewhere in that mess
[23:00:16] <tbranyen> is an answer
[23:00:21] <Patman> digging through it now
[23:00:24] <Patman> thanks a million
[23:02:03] <Patman> so far looks like the closest thing is the commented out .fn.style
[23:03:16] <Patman> another idea i just head is to just remove and recreate it... not ideal but should be fully cross browser compat
[23:07:19] <Patman> tbranyen: thanks, do you know if css loads top down?
