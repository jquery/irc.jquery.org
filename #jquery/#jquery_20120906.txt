[00:06:18] <howardgrigg> hey anyone around that can help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/HgAQu/1392/
[00:06:50] <howardgrigg> i want it so that it updates the span with the correct position of each object after being dragged and dropped
[00:07:10] <howardgrigg> not the same position for all of them… which it does currently
[00:08:50] <tknz> Hey guys. You know how you can do this $('p').click(function() { $(this).show(); } );  ... If i have that function defined externally i.e. $('p').click(externalFunction()) .. how can I retrieve the $(this) object? It seems to return the window...
[00:16:22] <diverdude> Is it possible to use find() to search for a hidden field with value="42" ?
[00:29:17] <beachandbytes> diverdude $('input[value="3"]'
[00:29:55] <diverdude> thx
[01:09:02] <pllx> Hi everybody ! I'm trying to select the second column of a table.   I tried  $("tr > td:eq(1)") but it works only for the first row of my table... can someone tell me why ?
[01:11:58] <blackspotwiggins> pllx, because :eq(1) selects the second td in that set
[01:13:05] <pllx> so :eq() always only return one element ?
[01:13:50] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[01:13:54] <blackspotwiggins> look at the docs
[01:15:26] <pllx> I get the logic... thanks blackspotwiggins
[01:19:13] <johnnyholm> Hi there, I've got a question: I have a function that handles actions when I click a certain link. that then goes to another function where $(this) turns to obj. in that new function I have an if statement checking if this link has the class of "remove". But I get an error saying "TypeError". when I console.log "obj" i get the entire link. when I alert it I get the url
[01:19:24] <johnnyholm> what am I doing wrong?
[01:30:09] <zedro> You're losing the "this" context.
[01:30:22] <zedro> try doing something like var _this = this; right before the callback declaration
[01:30:30] <zedro> and then using _this in place of this inside that event hanldler
[01:30:32] <zedro> handler*
[01:30:42] <zedro> johnnyholm: that was for you
[01:33:09] <DarsVaeda> why does the remove work, but not the set? http://jsfiddle.net/7R9uZ/
[01:33:40] <inad922> hello
[01:34:32] <inad922> If I have a name match with the $() function how do I determine the tag type?(I matched with $('*[name="asdasdad"]')  )
[01:34:32] <Trudko> can jquery tell me what is run onload?
[01:34:52] <Trudko> you mean tagName?
[01:35:00] <Trudko> you can do $()[0].tagName
[01:39:03] <xec_> inad922: just a sidenote, you don't need the * in that selector (it is implied)
[01:39:24] <inad922> xec_: ow ok. That's good to know. I'm kinda newbie with this library
[01:40:05] <AdamPDotty> Vader: I guess click gives the currently clicked element, while each() gives a set, so its usually not the same.
[01:41:57] <t432> <img src=\""+var+"\"/> <--is this the correct way use the var? <-- getting " %20Object%5D "
[01:42:27] <shiftingcontrol> is it possible to handle events inside ajaxForm() jquery plugin? http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/
[01:43:29] <shoky> t432:  what language is that supposed to be?
[01:43:38] <t432> jquery
[01:43:44] <shoky> it looks like html
[01:44:02] <shoky> jquery isn't a language ;s
[01:44:09] <t432> that was just an extract
[01:44:22] <shoky> why would you extract
[01:44:24] <t432>  event = $("<div id=\"-msg-box\"><div id=\"-inner-box\"><img src=\""+image+"\"/></div></div>");
[01:44:29] <AdamPDotty> and where to start? first "var" is reserved
[01:44:33] <t432> thats the whole thing
[01:45:35] <shoky> if image is defined, that should be ok..
[01:45:54] <AdamPDotty> hmmm, to what avail?
[01:46:17] <AdamPDotty> "<div" is not a good start for a selector
[01:46:25] <shoky> it's not a selector
[01:46:36] <shoky> html string
[01:47:00] <AdamPDotty> it got the $()
[01:47:14] <shoky> ?jquery function
[01:47:18] <shoky> eh
[01:47:26] <shoky> AdamPDotty: go read the docs for $()
[01:47:27] <AdamPDotty> ? jqeurry function
[01:47:32] <shoky> bot is gone
[01:48:18] <t432> [09:37:38.332] GET http://localhost:8080/app/%5Bobject%20Object%5D [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 11ms]
[01:48:29] <shoky> right, it worked
[01:48:35] <shoky> but image was an object.. not a string
[01:48:57] <AdamPDotty> the string might be image.src then
[01:49:00] <shoky> so you created an <img> element with src="[object object]"
[01:49:16] <t432> server returns byte[]
[01:49:23] <shoky> hah.
[01:49:43] <t432> so image holds byte[]
[01:49:49] <shoky> there is no byte[] in javascript
[01:50:04] <t432> well the content of byte[]
[01:50:09] <shoky> right...
[01:50:17] <t432> in json form
[01:50:35] <shoky> src attribute is usually for a url to an image..
[01:50:55] <t432> i had this working on a diff app
[01:51:01] <t432> maybe i missed something
[01:51:52] <blackspotwiggins> use base64 encoding and data uris
[01:51:57] <shoky> you can put encoded data in the src attribute with a data:  thingy
[01:52:03] <shoky> yeah that
[01:52:46] <t432> blackspotwiggins: can i get a url?
[01:53:04] <shoky> but either way, that image variable is just an object, not an encoded string
[01:53:15] <blackspotwiggins> t432, what?
[01:53:36] <t432> an article/tutorial or something
[01:53:40] <shoky> if it's an object parsed from json, you need to access its relevant properties
[01:53:42] <blackspotwiggins> www.google.com
[01:53:46] <t432> nvm
[01:54:14] <blackspotwiggins> src has to be url, it cant be raw data
[01:54:31] <blackspotwiggins> url includes possibility of data:
[01:54:54] <blackspotwiggins> if you have plain bytes you can decode it using some image decoder and use <canvas> to display it
[01:55:08] <blackspotwiggins> why anyone sane would do that instead of using data: however..
[01:58:12] <Axsuul> Is it me or does jquery fade animations lag in safari?
[02:05:35] <_shellox__> hi
[02:05:36] <DarsVaeda> in the current jquery how do I disable a hidden input element? attr('disabled', 'disabled') ?
[02:07:20] <DarsVaeda> because in my case this doesn't work, firebug highlights the hidden element indicating that something is happening but the disabled attribute is not added
[02:07:57] <_shellox__> http://pastebin.ca/2201709
[02:08:28] <_shellox__> is there something for the change element, so that i can only show the alert if a specific value is selected?
[02:14:59] <diverdude> I have a twitter bootstrap modal with a twitter bootstrap collapsable control inside: http://jsfiddle.net/mwT2p/13/ I want to ensure that the collapseble control is collapsed every time the modal is opened or reopened. The problem is that if i open the modal box, expand the collapsable and then close the modal box and reopen it, the panel remains expanded even though it should be collapsed. How can i ensure collapsed at every opening/re-opening?
[02:18:43] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/6PRH4/ this works nothing as expected :(
[02:19:55] <DarsVaeda> although adding the class works just like I supposed it would adding and removing the disabled property does not work
[02:22:06] <DarsVaeda> oh I think it is a bug :O it works with 1.7.2
[02:22:19] <Zogot> DarsVaeda: Isn't it just easier to use a checkbox?
[02:22:35] <DarsVaeda> actually the buttons are images
[02:22:44] <DarsVaeda> wrapped in a link
[02:23:01] <DarsVaeda> I changed it for the example cause I can not add the images there
[02:23:18] <DarsVaeda> in 1.7.2 it works using .attr()
[02:23:20] <DarsVaeda> -.-
[02:23:32] <Zogot> Even then, just have the image with a data-property that references the checkbox name and just hide the checkboxes
[02:23:35] <Zogot> will still be easier :p
[02:24:02] <DarsVaeda> I didn't even get what you mean, so no it is not easier :D
[02:24:27] <DarsVaeda> anyway I am more concerned about that bug
[02:24:38] <xec_> DarsVaeda: to retrieve the ID you can just do "this.id"
[02:25:55] <xec_> DarsVaeda: http://jsfiddle.net/6PRH4/1/
[02:26:37] <DarsVaeda> xec_: yes but this doesn't work either
[02:27:24] <xec_> oh? what did you expect to happen? looks like the selected class gets set on the clicked button and removed from the others
[02:27:43] <DarsVaeda> the disabled state of the input should vanish
[02:27:56] <xec_> aha
[02:28:37] <DarsVaeda> but it sets it to disabled=""
[02:28:46] <xec_> DarsVaeda: well they are still of type="hidden"
[02:29:00] <DarsVaeda> that is not the same
[02:29:10] <DarsVaeda> if they are disabled they are not send in a form
[02:35:47] <xec_> DarsVaeda: i see what you mean. but it doesn't seem to work with 1.7.2 either?
[02:36:11] <DarsVaeda> yes but with the attr it does, even in the current
[02:36:21] <DarsVaeda> now I'm really confused what to actually use
[02:36:52] <se-lite> Not sure if this is a jquery or html/css question, but i have the following problem: I have a menu i have to dynamic adjust the size on based on content. It basicly end up with me using $().width(<some width>). The problem is in chrome, even tho the css says correct number of pixels, the element displayed is 1px less. Anyone got a clue what this is/how to fix it?
[02:42:25] <xec_> DarsVaeda: actually, i think it does work
[02:42:47] <DarsVaeda> really? how?
[02:42:48] <xec_> DarsVaeda: firebug just doesn't show it for some reason
[02:43:07] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/6PRH4/4/
[02:43:16] <xec_> i just set them to type text so you can see them
[02:44:11] <xec_> when inspecting the inputs in firebug i don't see any changed in the disabled bit, it seems to just show the original setting (attribute)
[02:44:17] <xec_> any change*
[02:44:38] <xec_> but you can clearly see that the input gets disabled and enabled
[02:45:37] <xec_> tested in 1.8.0 too btw. and it's definitely .prop() and not .attr() you want
[02:47:28] <DarsVaeda> okay I see
[02:47:32] <DarsVaeda> but why prop?
[02:48:32] <DarsVaeda> isn't disabled an attribute? I read that in a w3c document on the other hand using prop was also highly recommended in other places, which was why I used it
[02:49:16] <xec_> yes and no
[02:51:42] <xec_> i'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but as far as i understand you can think of attributes as what is written in the html (static), while property is the changeable value on the dom element
[02:52:50] <xec_> the attribute won't tell you if the input is actually disabled or not, but the property will
[02:53:10] <xec_> the attribute just reflects what is written in the html, iirc
[02:53:17] <xec_> make any sense?
[02:53:40] <DarsVaeda> yes that makes sense
[02:53:58] <DarsVaeda> thanks :)
[02:54:05] <xec_> the confusing thing is that jquery, prior to 1.6, changed properties with the .attr() method
[02:56:37] <DarsVaeda> this also explains the firebug thing when disabled disappears when using attr
[02:58:20] <xec_> yeah, it looks like .attr() works too, maybe it still changes properties for backwards compatibility or something? i dunno. i would stick to .prop() anyway xD
[02:59:14] * xec_ is confused
[02:59:57] <pllx> I have multiples nested div, which all have an .click(function()   -the same function in fact-    when I click one, I always trigger the root div's function ...  is this the normal behavior ?
[03:00:15] <xec_> pllx: yes
[03:00:38] <xec_> pllx: you can do event.stopPropagation() if you want to prevent bubbling
[03:01:19] <xec_> where "event" is the 1st parameter to the click handler, like: .click(function(event){...})
[03:03:04] <xec_> ?demo @ se-lite
[03:03:05] <bot-t> se-lite, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:03:34] <xec_> se-lite: hard to tell what could be causing it without seeing it first-hand
[03:04:27] <pllx> thanks xec. I'll look into that.  (I'm learning jq)
[03:05:17] <xec_> pllx: that method is actually vanilla JS, not jq :) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event.stopPropagation
[03:07:04] <pllx> oh, does it's behavior differs with the browser I use ?
[03:10:12] <NoOova> Hello all!
[03:10:21] <NoOova> what is $.Widget?
[03:10:30] <xec_> pllx: no, quite safe as far as i know
[03:10:31] <NoOova> and how it different from $.widget
[03:14:42] <xec_> pllx: actually, i think maybe jq normalizes it. see http://api.jquery.com/category/event-object/
[03:18:16] <EweR> any1 else experienced in jquery UI datepicker when u add year or month dropdowns and try to choose other than the default one, the focus "jumps" back to default one..
[03:22:55] <Heather_> Is it possible that html tags that are looped in to place by php is not effected by javascript? Even though I use each(function(){});
[03:24:17] <sahbeewah> Heather_, no.
[03:28:47] <Heather_> can think of any other explanation to why the first tag that is present in the php file is the only one affected by jquery. The other tags that are not shown but generated when you run the site does not work. The jquery is solid and should iterate through all the tags with a certain id.
[03:29:58] <Heather_> the first element*
[03:30:17] <sahbeewah> Heather_, if you're using the id attribute of a tag you might encounter some problems
[03:30:43] <sahbeewah> ids must be unique on a page
[03:31:05] <Heather_> okay I see
[03:31:28] <Heather_> what would you suggest that I use? Not that familiar with html.
[03:31:38] <AdamPDotty> a class
[03:31:49] <Heather_> okay
[03:31:53] <sahbeewah> it depends on what you're trying to achieve
[03:33:34] <pllx> xec_ > I created a fiddle( http://jsfiddle.net/v2CTR/3/ )   where should I put the stopPropagation to be able to create sub level div ?
[03:34:04] <Heather_> I plan o use a lot of jquery so what would be the best approach to structure html? Mostly program php/mysql so I include html in my php files.
[03:34:40] <xec_> pllx: hmmm, on the click handler of the sub level div. but you don't have one in that demo?
[03:35:42] <sahbeewah> Heather_, that couldn't have been more vague
[03:35:44] <xec_> oh wait
[03:35:47] <pllx> xec_ ah    had one on my local file... forgot it then
[03:36:20] <sahbeewah> what did the ids represent?
[03:36:54] <Heather_> image's that work as buttons
[03:38:02] <xec_> pllx: http://jsfiddle.net/v2CTR/6/
[03:38:51] <sahbeewah> you mean the ids were on img tags?
[03:39:21] <Heather_> yes
[03:39:25] <sahbeewah> just stop and rethink your design... the reason html doesn't support multiple ids is because it doesn't make sense to have multiple ids
[03:39:26] <sh0ne> how can I make ajax request to return alert on success?
[03:40:50] <xec_> pllx: is that what you meant? prevent clicks on the created divs from bubbling to the #main one?
[03:41:00] <sahbeewah> sh0ne, use the success callback on the ajax request?
[03:42:18] <pllx> xec_ > not exactly,  I wanted newly created divs to be clickable as well,  tried it here : http://jsfiddle.net/v2CTR/5/
[03:42:43] <sh0ne> sahbeewah: I did that: "success: function () { alert('Hello') }" but even the request is successfully executed alert doesn't show
[03:42:50] <pllx> xec_ but you code helps me see what I miss :)
[03:43:04] <Heather_> alert();
[03:43:26] <sahbeewah> sh0ne, how do you know it executed successfully?
[03:44:08] <xec_> pllx: ok, i'm confused, not sure what you want it to do =) did you figure it out?
[03:44:27] <sh0ne> sahbeewah: because it have to call the action that sends mail and I get the mail in inbox upon running ajax request.
[03:44:54] <sh0ne> so i assumed it is successfully executed
[03:45:21] <sahbeewah> don't make that assumption
[03:45:44] <sahbeewah> your server side script may have died or exited with an error before it completely executed
[03:46:12] <sahbeewah> using your dev tools check on the network tab to ensure that the ajax call is actually being returned successfully
[03:47:17] <Heather_> sahbeewah worked with class attribute. But I ahve to ask what is the most flexible way to work with html? I have html in my php files since it feels convenient to retrieve and show data with it. Is it a better idea to just use javascript for that purpose?
[03:47:18] <davetarmac> hey guys - I'm still having bother with this darn script to change some text on hoverâ€¦ It doesn't want to stay as the new text over child elements http://pastebin.com/mgXVT3Xn
[03:49:08] <sahbeewah> Heather_, that depends largely on the type of website/application you're building
[03:50:32] <sahbeewah> in most cases that's fine... that's what php is
[03:51:11] <Heather_> okay thx for the help
[03:54:57] <granden> After issueing a event.preventDefault(); could I then do the default action after all my jquery is finnished?
[03:55:51] <granden> say I got it on a internal link, I would like to fade out one div and then redirect the user. To the page he would have gotten to if I did not have any preventDefault
[03:56:10] <sh0ne> sahbeewah: you were right all the way, I didn't get success because server-side was not correct (I looked in Firebug and noticed that). Thank you for your help, I appreciate it...I'd kiss you right now :)
[03:56:11] <sahbeewah> davetarmac, the ideal solution is to have the menu as child elements of the menu header... that way when you hover over the menu you're still on the menu header
[03:56:23] <sahbeewah> sh0ne, np
[03:56:51] <amccloud> Anyway to prevent the default action from happening when tab is pressed in a textarea? http://jsfiddle.net/bZ5CJ/
[03:56:54] <davetarmac> yeah - because of the nature of Drupal and it's inability to work nicely with multiple menus it had to be done this way :(
[03:57:01] <amccloud> Trying to prevent t he tab from actually showing up...
[03:57:04] <davetarmac> sahbeewah: ^^
[03:57:18] <davetarmac> sahbeewah: do you know how to get around that problem as it stands?
[03:57:26] <davetarmac> I've been trying on and off for three days now!
[04:00:06] <sahbeewah> hm
[04:00:24] <sahbeewah> well the first thing you're gonna need to do is not use .hover
[04:00:45] <sahbeewah> use .mouseover and .mouseout for the two separate functions
[04:02:28] <davetarmac> sahbeewah: what is the difference? if yo udon't mind me asking
[04:04:24] <sahbeewah> well, strictly speaking here, nothing
[04:04:33] <sahbeewah> but you're gonna need to play around with the separate handlers
[04:04:49] <sahbeewah> to detect whether what shows
[04:05:09] <sahbeewah> it just makes it visibly more explicit
[04:05:24] <davetarmac> OK
[04:05:28] <davetarmac> thanks for the advice
[04:10:52] <granden> If I got a variable with a hexcode for a color, like #ff9900 or so. And the variable name is imgcolor how would I do something ilke .css('background-color', imgcolor);
[04:10:57] <granden> now it complains about my hashtag
[04:11:06] <granden> and if I'm doing 'imgcolor' it wont now its a variable.
[04:21:23] <AdamPDotty> granden: worksforme
[04:22:42] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/kSmtB/ :/
[04:26:25] <Aamir> ah it returns https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/NodeList not array
[04:26:45] <AdamPDotty> yep
[04:29:20] <sh0ne> why replaceWith() doesn't work in this example http://jsfiddle.net/sMeD7/
[04:31:12] <sh0ne> JQuery 1.7.2 is the version
[04:34:50] <Aamir> sh0ne: because u have syntax error and you might want to use .html? http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/sMeD7/1/
[04:35:08] * syntax error
[04:35:10] <Aamir> sh0ne: also $('<h2>text</h2>') is not a valid selector

[04:36:38] <howardgrigg> hi there can anyone help me select the next 'select' field - this is pretty self-explanatory http://jsfiddle.net/yry4X/1/
[04:38:35] <sh0ne> Aamir: oh, I see....probably your solution with .html() is better, thank you for your help.
[04:38:35] <AdamPDotty> .parent().next().find('select')
[04:39:33] <AdamPDotty> or .closest('tr').find('select')
[04:40:02] <howardgrigg> AdamPDotty, thanks that has got it
[04:41:35] <Trudko> is there any significant difference between using $(window).load(... vs window.onLoad?
[04:42:00] <astropirate> Trudko, no
[04:42:13] <AdamPDotty> Ã¤hhm
[04:42:35] <AdamPDotty> as I remember, you can only load one function with window.onload
[04:42:52] <AdamPDotty> multiple with .load()
[04:45:21] <astropirate> aye true. but not any difference in behavior. I assumed thats what he was talking about
[05:03:53] <Jon47> yeahâ€¦ that's not a unique quality of window.onLoad, the same goes for any object property
[05:06:59] <beepbeep_> Hey all, I'm retrieving JSON using $.ajax. The JSON is a simple key: value. The PHP script generating the JSON returns the JSON string correctly, it contains multiple "Ã©" characters. When I console.log the JSON, I see that all the values containing "Ã©" characters are null. When I die my PHP script early, making it return a string with "Ã©" in it, and call the script using $.ajax, I see that
[05:06:59] <beepbeep_> "Ã©" characters have been replaced by "<?>".
[05:10:21] <diverdude> Boiled down to the essence - 5 lines of code:  http://jsfiddle.net/mwT2p/38/  Why is nothing happening when clicking the button called "collapse" ?
[05:14:13] <beepbeep_> Nvm, I just noticed that it's the PHP script that returns the data incorrectly.
[05:16:29] <jetsaredim> can someone post a barebones example of how to properly use the datatables plugin?
[05:17:06] <AdamPDotty> dude: cant find any function called "collapse()"
[05:18:37] <Heather_> how can I do a "reversed ajax request" e.g create an img element that is empty and then load it with content depending in server side code? So I can minizime client side coding?
[05:22:25] <shoky> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mwT2p/41/
[05:23:16] <diverdude> shoky: w000t you did it. genius. what did you do?
[05:23:45] <shoky> diverdude: just changed the selector inside the click handler
[05:24:00] <shoky> to the actual element that you're collapsing, not its trigger
[05:25:48] <diverdude> oh
[05:26:08] <diverdude> shoky: thx man
[05:27:44] <shoky> yw
[05:39:38] <coppa> hopla : automatic ajax navigation -> https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-navigate
[05:47:35] <ansolas> anyone using iScroll4?
[05:48:54] <coppa> yep
[05:49:46] <ansolas> which event is fired when you swipe with a mobile device ?
[05:50:08] <coppa> the function ontouchend
[05:50:18] <pHero> hello its me again, can someone help me, how do i trigger a close event on datepicker
[05:50:21] <ansolas> ok where do you found that ?
[05:50:30] <ansolas> is there an api ?
[05:50:37] <coppa> this is on the initialization of the iscroll, chetout there
[05:51:09] <coppa> onScrollEnd
[05:51:14] <coppa> to be exact
[05:51:20] <ansolas> http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4 ?
[05:51:28] <coppa> hm
[05:51:39] <ansolas> ok i can use that
[05:51:40] <diverdude> shoky: do you have a moment?
[05:51:43] <Trudko> Guys why is my console empty ? http://jsfiddle.net/MnW73/16/
[05:51:58] <k1ckn1ck> http://jsfiddle.net/XwN2L/552/ i have managed to get $toggled as the variable of the div to open but how would i set the var the the div to toggle?
[05:52:26] <ansolas> but that event is fired after after teh action
[05:52:32] <ansolas> i need an event on start
[05:52:34] <coppa> not an event a function
[05:52:48] <coppa> the function is called when scroll ends
[05:52:49] <ansolas> I liek to use this event to update the current page display
[05:53:06] <ansolas> onscolleend is fired after the page has turned
[05:53:11] <ansolas> yeah
[05:53:17] <ansolas> is there on scroll start ?
[05:57:33] <Trudko> astropirate: btw I guess jquery use attachEvent/ addEventListener
[05:58:44] <Trudko_> ops I dropped
[06:02:20] <jetsaredim> can someone please point me to a bare bones example of how to use the datatable plugin?
[06:02:59] <demersdesigns> Not to be a jerk, but did you check this out? http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/basic_init/zero_config.html
[06:03:21] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: yes but there's no sample code with that
[06:04:12] <jetsaredim> I tried to setup a basic html file with a simple table like that and including jquery and the plugin js but it's not auto-formatting it like that
[06:04:39] <Trudko_> anybody had problem in IE when using resizeTo or moveTO and you have left mouse button down it thorws access denied error, cant fix it with jquery load listener but works  ok with window.onLoad
[06:05:00] <jetsaredim> i'm trying to find an end-to-end example of just the basic setup - like a complete file
[06:05:08] <demersdesigns> jetsaredim: Another dumb question. Did you also include a css file that includes that styling? You would also need the images for the sorting icons.
[06:05:47] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: hm - didn't but i don't think that's going to change things - let me try
[06:07:17] <demersdesigns> jetsaredim: I would root around in the source on that page and on your page link to the css and images they are using to get started.
[06:07:44] <jetsaredim> yea i added the jquery.dataTables.css and no change
[06:10:12] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: i guess i'm just trying to figure out what attributes need to be set other than the "id" for the table in order to get it working
[06:10:37] <jetsaredim> all the examples I can find have all sorts of crazy divs around them
[06:11:34] <Koopz> stuff makes me mad again...my autocomplete only triggers if i hit down or up...
[06:11:46] <demersdesigns> jetsaredim: That is most likely the plugin itself adding classes and divs. You should only need, at the very least, to do $('#example').dataTable();
[06:12:33] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: exactly - except i changed the id to something else - but it should still work
[06:14:35] <demersdesigns> jetsaredim: Hmm. Give me a sec.
[06:16:01] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: http://pastebin.com/0QtNrWNs
[06:17:07] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: i don't think i can get more basic than that
[06:17:28] <ansolas> is it possible to use the touch pad of an macbookpro to generate touchswipe events ?
[06:18:09] <demersdesigns> jetsaredim: Stupid question. Are you sure the paths are correct for both the css and the script?
[06:18:59] <tash> if I'd like to .each on my td's, do I need to select the tr's too? Or, can I do $('#table-id td').each() ?
[06:19:29] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns: yea i mean - when i inspect the file with firebug it's able to load the files - not getting errors in the console
[06:20:07] <jetsaredim> i'm serving up the file on my local web server
[06:20:18] <k1ckn1ck> i am still learning jquery. I have managed to get the script to do what i want, but would like to know if there was an easier shorter code to get the same result http://jsfiddle.net/XwN2L/553/
[06:20:46] <demersdesigns> jetsaredim: Not sure what could be going wrong there. Maybe this could help? http://datatables.net/blog/Creating_beautiful_and_functional_tables_with_DataTables
[06:21:18] <antheee> jetsaredim: you have to call your javascript code as well. at the moment its not running
[06:22:28] <antheee> jetsaredim: http://pastebin.com/FAikPnJF
[06:23:33] <jetsaredim> antheee: omg that was it - i forgot the "$"
[06:23:44] <jetsaredim> demersdesigns antheee: thanks
[06:25:27] <Trudko_> can somehow onload rewrite jquery's load handler?
[06:26:35] <TimTim`> $.fn.load = function(){alert('lol you sure you wanna do this?')}
[06:28:48] <Koopz> *enrage* smurfin' autocomplete!
[06:29:12] <Trudko_> TimTim`: what I worry is if I call jquery load and then window.onload is called, will code passed to load function still work?
[06:30:21] <TimTim`> what are you trying to do Trudko_
[06:31:05] <Trudko_> TimTim`: nothing specially realy I just need to call something on onLoad but there is some code run after that which I dont have control off
[06:33:36] <Trudko_> TimTim`: thats not whole truth whole truth I want to fix this error  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/904947
[06:33:55] <Trudko_> only solution I found so far is to run moveTo resizeTo in onload
[06:34:22] <alaing> Hi I'm using jquery 1,7,1 and in ie7 $('#foo').is('span') is returning false but #foo is a span
[06:34:40] <alaing> and ff works perfectly
[06:35:02] <TimTim`> Trudko_ can i see your code
[06:35:13] <TimTim`> www.pastebin.com
[06:35:55] <tash> wondering if there is an easy way to add every td with class="test" in every row...basically a sum of 1 particular column
[06:36:21] <tash> I'm assuming I'd have to select the table and do an each on the td's ?
[06:36:30] <alaing> tash I know a great calculation plugin
[06:36:42] <alaing> no you dont need to
[06:37:02] <tash> I wouldn't really need a plugin right? Seems like it'd be pretty straight forward, my brain just isn't working right now :)
[06:37:42] <alaing> tash small and simple really
[06:37:43] <alaing> http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/calculation/calculation.plugin.htm
[06:38:53] <alaing> tash its as simple as $('.foo').sum()
[06:42:42] <_fury> Did anyone try to write a jquery bookmarklet for facebook? Somehow mine destroys sone ajax features of facebook. Did anyone make a similar experience?
[06:42:57] <tash> alaing: thanks, I might give that a shot.
[06:43:25] <alaing> tash no problem shout if you need help with it
[06:44:22] <alaing> Hi I'm using jquery 1,7,1 and in ie7 $('#foo').is('span') is returning false but #foo is a span. any ideas how I can get wround this bug
[06:44:28] <Trudko_> TimTim`: http://pastebin.com/sdxrVKE0
[06:45:08] <PrgmrBill> alaing: did you try $('span#foo').length > 0 ?
[06:45:08] <wolfehr> hey guys, what's the best way to apply a click handler to a parent div when I also need to apply a click handler to a child element within the parent (if I apply a click handler to the child, will it trigger first before the parent click handler?)
[06:45:50] <wolfehr> basically if the child click handler is triggered I want to prevent the parent from being called (I guess I could unbind the parent, but only if the child is called first)
[06:47:16] <shoky> diverdude: still need help?
[06:47:17] <alaing> PrgmrBill: Arrr I hadn't thought about that. Not sure how I could use that thought because I'm passing in a jquery object  to my function $elem.is('span'). Actually I could use .filter('span').length
[06:47:33] <PrgmrBill> yeah
[06:47:56] <wolfehr> ah, e.stopPropogation() looks like what I'm after
[06:48:03] <diverdude> shoky: i seem to have managed actually
[06:50:25] <Koopz> what on earth could keep my input from autocompleting automatically?! the list only appears if i hit down or up... >_<
[06:50:33] <itatitat> ey guys, Im trying this two lines, but is not working, can you tell me how is it?
[06:50:54] <toddWork> ey itatitat
[06:51:48] <itatitat> https://gist.github.com/3656460
[06:52:24] <toddWork> this doesn't look right: jQuery(list_tagsDOM ' li')
[06:52:49] <toddWork> jQuery('li', list_tagsDOM) maybe?
[06:53:04] <itatitat> jummmmmmmmmmm
[06:53:08] <itatitat> oooooooooh, yes........in the context.............can be
[06:53:24] <toddWork> i'm not sure where your li is in relation to your a#
[06:53:33] <itatitat> genious, is working, thanks
[06:53:50] <toddWork> yw
[06:53:55] <Trudko_> TimTim`: did the code help?
[06:54:57] <_fury1> Is it possible to add a callback function to an element  which is called whenever a child element or the element itself loads something using ajax?
[06:55:35] <toddWork> _fury1: you can set a custom event on that ajax and then listen for it on each of your elements.
[06:55:38] <toddWork> for example:
[06:55:58] <toddWork> success: $(window).trigger('myevent:success', data);
[06:56:30] <toddWork> then, do something like $(window).on('myevent:success', function(data) { //do your stuff wherever
[06:57:55] <_fury1>  thank you!
[06:58:03] <toddWork> _fury1: i hope that helps.
[06:58:16] <_fury1> i will try
[06:58:23] <toddWork> that customevent trick is my new hammer and everything seems like a nail.
[06:58:36] <_fury1> ^^
[06:59:36] <_fury1> But that even has to be registered on all elements that could use ajax.
[07:00:07] <_fury1> I want to write a bookmarklet parsing the data loaded using ajax.
[07:02:20] <toddWork> yes. i like that style of having elements listening for the event as opposed to piling up the actions in a success callback.
[07:08:25] <scriptor> hi guys
[07:09:00] <scriptor> I'm currently trying to use .css to change the padding properties for some li elements
[07:09:55] <scriptor> however, we're "scoping" all our stuff under an element. so in my case I have a variable called $elem which is the parent element containing everything I need to work with
[07:10:29] <scriptor> $elem.find('li') will only return the top-level list elements. so doing $elem.find('li').css(â€¦) will only change the css for the top-level ones, instead of all of them
[07:10:40] <scriptor> is there any way to .css all elements, both top-level and nested ones?
[07:11:14] <Cork> $elm.find('li').andSelf()
[07:12:33] <jacta> how to find first span in a div with id="test"
[07:12:49] <Cork> jacta:  $('#test')
[07:12:57] <Cork> id's can only exist once in the page
[07:13:01] <Cork> or the page is invalid
[07:13:21] <jacta> sure, and then i want to find the first span in that id - i need height and width of it
[07:13:27] <scriptor> Cork: doesn't seem to work, it still doesn't get nested li's
[07:13:50] <Bleu|taF> $('#test').offset()
[07:13:54] <sahbeewah> scriptor, .find should find all elements
[07:14:12] <Cork> scriptor: wait a min
[07:14:13] <scriptor> sahbeewah: it does, but only indirectly
[07:14:36] <Cork> scriptor: find finds everything thats a child of the elements in $elem
[07:14:41] <scriptor> sahbeewah: if you have <li id='foo'><li i='bar'></li></li> it will return an array containing just the outer li
[07:14:49] <scriptor> Cork: yup
[07:14:54] <Cork> scriptor: thats not valid
[07:14:55] <sahbeewah> that's not valid html
[07:14:59] <Cork> you need ul or ol
[07:15:02] <scriptor> so I guess a better way to phrase it is, is there some sort of findAll?
[07:15:12] <scriptor> sorry, was using a simplified example
[07:15:19] <scriptor> the actual html has ul's nested in ul's
[07:15:35] <sahbeewah> that's not valid either
[07:15:46] <sahbeewah> the ul needs to be under the li
[07:15:50] <Cork> scriptor: <li><li></li></li> becomes <li></li><li></li>
[07:15:52] <sahbeewah> in any case, find is the findall
[07:15:57] <scriptor> <ul><li><ul>â€¦</ul></li></ul> isn't valid?
[07:15:59] <jacta> var w = $("#test").find("span").width(); <--would that be correct?
[07:16:12] <scriptor> because that's the structure I'm using
[07:16:18] <Cork> scriptor: yes it is
[07:16:27] <jsmonkey> anyone aware of why jquery keydown does not work in FF? it's not dom ready thingy because I use "on"
[07:16:35] <jsmonkey> works properly in chrome
[07:16:35] <Cork> scriptor: open the page in a debugger and check the dom tree
[07:16:39] <alaing> PrgmrBill: .filter('span').length didn't work
[07:17:06] <jsmonkey> and safari
[07:17:18] <scriptor> Cork: the dom isn't an issue
[07:17:19] <Cork> scriptor: if it shows the li's anywhere inside the $elem element find will find it
[07:17:36] <Cork> scriptor: yes it is, cause what your explaining can't happen if its not
[07:17:41] <alaing> Hi I'm using jquery 1,7,1 and in ie7 $('#foo').is('span') is returning false but #foo is a span. any ideas how I can get around this bug. I tried $elem.filter('span').length but thats also returning 0
[07:17:54] <Cork> ?.find @ scriptor
[07:17:54] <bot-t> scriptor, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[07:17:55] <alaing> FF reckons there is a span
[07:18:29] <Cork> scriptor: the behavior your explaining is .children()
[07:18:40] <jsmonkey> never mind! was just a firebug issue
[07:18:53] <Cork> scriptor: so either your not using jquery or your dom structure isn't what you think it is
[07:19:42] <alaing> Should I go back and use native JS?
[07:20:33] <Cork> alaing: what does $elem[0].nodeType say?
[07:20:53] <alaing> Cork: let me try
[07:21:14] <Cork> alaing: and what does $(*[id="foo"]').length say ?
[07:21:35] <alaing> Cork it works in FF
[07:21:40] <Cork> if its > 1 you have a duplicate id you need to remove
[07:21:50] <Cork> alaing: they do error correction a bit differently
[07:21:56] <alaing> oh i see where you coming from
[07:22:24] <fatninja> when creating a jquery plugin
[07:22:27] <fatninja> that is being used by more elements
[07:22:37] <fatninja> and each element has its personal settings
[07:22:46] <fatninja> is it a good idea to store the settings to the element using jquery $.data ?
[07:22:46] <fatninja> :
[07:22:53] <scriptor> Cork: this is the DOM structure: https://gist.github.com/3656796, it is all under $elem
[07:23:14] <Cork> scriptor: no thats the html
[07:23:20] <alaing> Cork IE 7 doesn't like $elem[0].nodeType
[07:23:33] <scriptor> Cork: copied straight from the inspector
[07:23:35] <Cork> alaing: check the selector then
[07:23:56] <alaing> Cork: ff reporting 1
[07:24:08] <Cork> alaing: and ie?
[07:24:19] <wolfehr> any way to get each so cycle through selectors that have two particular classes assigned e.g. $('.class1 .class2').each()
[07:24:28] <alaing> ie is showing js error
[07:24:30] <wolfehr> or do I have to do hasClass within the each?
[07:24:50] <alaing> '0.nodeType' is null or not an object
[07:24:51] <Cork> alaing: js error for $(*[id="foo"]').length ?
[07:25:03] <Cork> ah no run that selector
[07:25:07] <faraway> fatninja: it is a good idea, but you need to take about on thing. if you remove an element or it's parent with remove form the dome, you loose the data. (like the attache event listeners are removed) if you need to remove it temporary and keep the data you need to use detach
[07:25:23] <faraway> fatninja: * take care *
[07:25:27] <Cork> scriptor: do you have a link to the page?
[07:25:40] <scriptor> Cork: sorry, it's internal, but I think I might have found the issue
[07:26:14] <jscheel> hi everyone, I',m having some trouble with the iframeFix in jquery-ui draggable. Specifically, this bugfix prevents click events from happening when a draggable is in the same position as an iframe: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7270
[07:26:21] <alaing> Cork: My selector I'm using is $('#report').next().find('.paginate')
[07:27:15] <jscheel> the fix makes sense for it's intended result, but if the _mouseup method in draggable has the wrong element in the event, because the iframe fix div is hovered over the draggable
[07:29:25] <jscheel> you can see the issue here: http://jsfiddle.net/9gbvd/6/
[07:33:04] <jscheel> I've left a note in trace, but I can't re-open the ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7270#comment:6
[07:33:22] <alaing> Cork How do I write that length selector
[07:37:54] <jscheel> anybody have any insight into draggable's internals?
[07:39:28] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: ping, you've done a lot of work on draggable, right?
[07:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: no, I avoid all of the interaction plugins.
[07:40:24] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: ah, sorry
[07:40:58] <jscheel> trying to look through the contributors on github
[07:41:20] <jscheel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js
[07:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that bug seems bad.
[07:42:23] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: it's definitely a show-stopper for me, of course, I have to be doing something totally wonky that most people would never run into
[07:42:32] <alaing> Cork: $('#report').next().find('.paginate').length is 0 in IE and 1 in firefox
[07:43:00] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: I'm not sure how to prevent this from happening, other than creating a new event on "this" during the _mouseUp phase of draggables' events
[07:43:53] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: http://jsfiddle.net/MruUn/1/
[07:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> hooray for z-index hell.
[07:44:20] <alaing> How can $('#report').next().find('.paginate').length be 1 in FF but 0 in IE7?
[07:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: I just added some CSS rules. You can probably find values that work for your app.
[07:45:32] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: wow, thanks. I played with z-index, but I was modifying the index on the draggable, not the iframefix
[07:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> If you modified the z-index on the draggable high enough, that would work.
[07:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/MruUn/2/
[07:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> You just have to go higher than 1000.
[07:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> Which I think is ridiculous.
[07:48:05] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: well, that fixes the use case most users will run into. Now I have to figure out how to make it work with my insane craziness, in which I am actually creating an iframe dynamically, then moving elements into the iframe's document, and attaching draggables from the parent :)
[07:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm shocked that you have that working.
[07:49:03] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: yep, had to fix draggable to keep track of the document it actually resides in
[07:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: The rewrite should handle that properly.
[07:49:38] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: it works, but the iframeFix is in the parent doc, which means the z-index will always be higer
[07:49:41] <jscheel> higer
[07:49:44] <jscheel> higher, can't type
[07:49:51] <EweR> any1 else experienced in jquery UI datepicker when u add year or month dropdowns and try to choose other than the default one, the focus "jumps" back to default one. its in chorme, but in FF it works without flaws
[07:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> We now track the document and window so that things should work cross-document: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L232-237
[07:50:51] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: oh, awesome! That is incredible. Basically, the same idea as what I did to make draggable work
[07:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: FWIW, the rewrite intentionally puts this logic into its own function so you can override it to apply whatever crazy logic you need: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L346
[07:53:00] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: in _create, I store a reference to the document context, then use that to fix the _mouseStop phase. I also fixed an issue where iframeFix wasn't working with a selector for the option: http://pastebin.com/fGjsWSuT
[07:53:12] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: is this going into 1.9?
[07:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> 2.0
[07:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> Which is far away.
[07:53:31] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: ah
[07:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Unless someone steps up and finishes the rewrites for all the interactions :-P

[07:53:57] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: :)
[07:56:20] <TheFuzzball> I'm animating the height of a <div> injected between a <header> and another <div>, when I set the height directly (no animation) it renders okay in IE7, but animating it doesn't push down the second div.
[07:56:38] <fatninja> faraway: yep, you're right, thanks for the tip!
[08:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Have you seen the new widget factory code for _super() and extensions?
[08:00:47] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: nope, haven't seen any of it
[08:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: It makes what you're doing much nicer. Let me throw together an example.
[08:04:20] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: thansk!
[08:04:22] <jscheel> thanks!
[08:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: https://gist.github.com/3657128
[08:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Based on the extension you're already building.
[08:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> Note how much cleaner the $.widget() line is :-)
[08:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> And you get ._super() so you don't need to do manual proxying anymore.
[08:06:24] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: ah, very nice!
[08:06:28] <coppa> btw jquery ui not compatible with jquery 1.8
[08:06:39] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: oh, really? Didn't realize that
[08:06:39] <coppa> curCSS
[08:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> It detects when you're redefining a widget as opposed to just inheriting from another widget.
[08:06:44] <piotr_> I'm trying to get ahold of a radio group inside a div called someDiv.. how can I do so?
[08:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> coppa: UPGRADE!!!!
[08:06:51] <coppa> ehehk
[08:07:26] <jscheel> wait, jquery ui 1.8.23 isn't compatible with jquery 1.8?
[08:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: it is
[08:07:39] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: ah
[08:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> People keep upgrading jQuery core without upgrading jQuery UI and they're surprised that it doesn't work :-/
[08:08:21] <jscheel> hah
[08:09:04] <coppa> btw when is planned jquery ui 1.9 ?
[08:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's not exactly easy supporting 18 different versions of jQuery :-P
[08:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> coppa: a few weeks
[08:09:51] <coppa> cool
[08:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> I was hoping to have 1.9 released by the end of August, but we couldn't get all the new sites done in time.
[08:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 supports jQuery 1.6+
[08:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> So that at least brings some sanity to the number of versions we support.
[08:10:41] <coppa> bah fair enough
[08:10:57] <slick-> if i have html which is: <span class="numbered-rounded">4</span>, how do i make jquery find the text in between (4) and replace it to something else?
[08:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, that still comes out to 10 different versions of jQuery core.
[08:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Our support matrix is crazy.
[08:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/728
[08:11:25] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: I'm definitely excited about 1.9
[08:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> slick-: $( ".numbered-rounded" ).text( "whatever" )
[08:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Me too! Over 2 years in the making...
[08:11:53] <slick-> <3
[08:12:34] <coppa> sure
[08:13:55] <eip56> mornin
[08:15:13] <slick-> does this look right? http://jsfiddle.net/CKEsC/
[08:15:59] <coppa> .html("1")
[08:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> coppa: .text() is better, he's setting a number as the value.
[08:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> slick-: It shouldn't be inside .each().
[08:17:11] <slick-> im trying to do for multiple ones
[08:17:11] <slick-> it works
[08:17:13] <slick-> thanks babes
[08:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> slick-: It does it for all regardless of the .each()
[08:17:54] <scott_gonzalez> The .each() is not limiting what $( ".numbered-rounded" ) is finding.
[08:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> You're just duplicating the work for every li that the other selector is finding.
[08:18:15] <slick-> yeah
[08:18:18] <slick-> i wanna do a count
[08:18:20] <slick-> so it works better
[08:18:24] <coppa> scott_gonzalez: interesting k
[08:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> coppa: It's just safer, since he's not actually setting HTML.
[08:19:54] <coppa> yep if tags around
[08:23:35] <qwebirc1016601> I'm getting some Jquery using myData = jQuery.getJSON('url');  If I do console.log(myData) I see an XMLHttpRequest object with a response property that has a string with the json data I want...
[08:24:04] <qwebirc1016601> I'm trying to parse this as such: JSON.parse(myData.response) and other variants but am having no luck...
[08:24:43] <gnarf> starpile: you need to use a callback function
[08:25:00] <gnarf> jQuery.getJSON('url', function( data ) { do something with data })
[08:25:16] <acxty> Hi guys. Is it possible to get the html of a page using .get() or any other function?
[08:25:48] <gnarf> starpile: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:26:44] <acxty> the page is not on the same domain
[08:27:59] <starpile> gnarf - I just want to set some variables based on the json properties...
[08:28:23] <gnarf> starpile: you MUST use a callback function to do this, and do any operation which then depends on that data
[08:28:26] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: the widget syntax, with super, is that available in 1.8.23, or is that coming in 2.0?
[08:28:30] <gnarf> you don't get a choice
[08:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: 1.9
[08:28:57] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: ah, thanks
[08:29:09] <starpile> gnarf = roger, thanks
[08:30:25] <starpile> gnarf = Iok, that gives me the data I need. I guess the question is how to bind the data to variables I can use outside of my getJSON callback...
[08:31:11] <gnarf> starpile: put those variables outside of the getJSON callback, but you'll still need to make sure that call has actually been called - read the slides it kinda explains how to handle it
[08:31:12] <slick-> if i have code like: <span data-cat="lol"> <span class="numbered-rounded">0</span></span>
[08:31:20] <slick-> how do I only set the numbered rounded for specific categories
[08:31:23] <slick-> or data-cats
[08:32:15] <NodeX> anyone know if "done()" works after "on()"
[08:34:20] <slick-> will this work? $("span").attr("data-cat").(".numbered-rounded").text(x)
[08:34:20] <johnkpaul> NodeX: on() returns a jquery object, .done() is on deferreds
[08:34:33] <ML74> What's the best way to auto refresh an HTML table?
[08:34:44] <johnkpaul> slick-: that is probably a syntax error
[08:34:50] <slick-> hmm
[08:34:55] <johnkpaul> slick-: can you explain what you are trying to do
[08:35:05] <slick-> i have code like this:  <span data-cat="lol"> <span class="numbered-rounded">0</span></span>
[08:35:07] <johnkpaul> set the text of numbered-rounded to the span's data-cat attribute
[08:35:12] <slick-> i wanna set the numbered rounded for only select data-cats
[08:35:14] <slick-> not all of them
[08:35:35] <slick-> how?
[08:35:44] <johnkpaul> slick-: $("span[data-cat]").find(".numbered-rounded").text(x)
[08:35:47] <slick-> <3
[08:35:48] <slick-> thx
[08:35:51] <johnkpaul> np, have fun
[08:35:56] <NodeX> I need to "click" something but only after the bind() (on() in my case) has been triggered
[08:36:13] <NodeX> triggered -> bound
[08:36:32] <NodeX> and I can't use doc.ready because it's already been fired by this point
[08:36:39] <johnkpaul> NodeX: so after you attach the handler using .on() call $jqobj.trigger('click')
[08:36:46] <NodeX> tried that
[08:37:07] <NodeX> the trouible is that the element it's being bound to is dyanimcally built (not via ajax)
[08:37:11] <NodeX> trouble*
[08:37:29] <johnkpaul> ?demo @NodeX
[08:37:30] <bot-t> NodeX, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:37:33] <NodeX> it's a simple race condition
[08:37:51] <coppa> bot-t:  stole my thought
[08:37:52] <johnkpaul> but if there's no ajax, what is asynchronous?
[08:37:53] <bot-t> coppa, Couldn't find "stole my thought" in jQuery Docs.
[08:38:04] <NodeX> that's my question.... it's a race condition
[08:38:09] <coppa> ah ah ah ah
[08:38:22] <johnkpaul> NodeX: js is single threaded, without something like ajax or setTimeouts, there shouldn't be race condtions
[08:38:34] <slick-> johnkpaul: $("span[data-cat]").find(".numbered-rounded").text(x) will set it for all cateogories
[08:38:45] <slick-> i wanna set it for data-cats which equal to restaurants
[08:38:47] <NodeX> demo = javascript adds a link to a page, on() is bound to it, $("thelink").click() is called ... but the on isn't fired
[08:38:48] <sunbeam> is it possible to detect whether a <h1> is displayed on one or two lines?
[08:38:48] <johnkpaul> slick-: data-cat=lol
[08:38:52] <slick-> oh ok
[08:38:53] <slick-> thx
[08:39:38] <Hopsy> I want to detect 404 images, any scripts for this?
[08:39:51] <starpile> gnarf - thanks for the help, I just bound the json data to my jquery functions inside the $.getJSON success function and it works like a charm...
[08:40:17] <johnkpaul> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/eHEdb/
[08:40:48] <NodeX> the thing I am inserting is a little larger than that!!
[08:40:59] <NodeX> but yes that's the general gist
[08:40:59] <johnkpaul> :) so give me a demo
[08:41:04] <johnkpaul> and I can help
[08:41:20] <johnkpaul> NodeX: so the general gist case works, so something you are doing is different
[08:41:29] <NodeX> Not really possible as the code is a clients and I have an NDA
[08:41:41] <NodeX> I'll use a timeout
[08:41:43] <johnkpaul> ?g reduced test case @ NodeX
[08:41:45] <bot-t> NodeX, Reduced Test Cases | CSS-Tricks - http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[08:41:46] <NodeX> easier than arguing
[08:42:14] <johnkpaul> sorry, didn't intended to argue, just hard to move forward without an example
[08:42:32] <NodeX> A simple yes/no was what I was after regarding the on()
[08:43:48] <slick-> ok, when I find the right attributes, it sets the value, but how do i make it iterate as well
[08:43:49] <slick-> $("span[data-cat=category_name]").find(".numbered-rounded").text(z)
[08:44:01] <slick-> i want z to iterate as the category name is found
[08:44:12] <johnkpaul> ?each @slick-
[08:44:13] <bot-t> slick-, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[08:44:28] <slick-> thx
[08:44:40] <johnkpaul> np
[08:52:12] <sunbeam> is it possible to add a text-decoration: underline below a <a> its lines even if it is on multiple lines?
[08:52:41] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Sure. It looks funky but it should be how it works.
[08:53:06] <sjeijk> can I bind a toggle function to an element that i create in a plugin like here? http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/8/
[08:53:18] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: how
[08:53:41] <slick-> when i add data-cat=category_name, it doesnt seem to find the text
[08:53:41] <slick-> :(
[08:54:11] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: You mean just like this? http://jsfiddle.net/hWMLw/
[08:54:16] <slick-> will this code: $("span[data-cat=category_name]").find(".numbered-rounded").text(x)  replace the text in this html: <span data-cat="lol"> <span class="numbered-rounded">0</span></span>
[08:54:34] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: str4ange
[08:54:39] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: yea
[08:54:43] <sunbeam> but that doesn't work hegre
[08:55:30] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Is there some weird kind of white-space setting on it?
[08:56:25] <BillCriswell> slick-: Yeah. You can even do $('span[data-cat=lol] .numbered-rounded').text(23); if you want.
[08:57:39] <venus_> hello how can i hide a div if another div element does not exist
[08:58:10] <slick-> ohhh i see what the problem is,  $("span[data-cat=cafes]").find(".numbered-rounded").text(x)
[08:58:15] <slick-> is there any way cafes can be a variabke
[08:58:18] <slick-> its taking it as a literal
[08:58:36] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: nvm i fixed it
[08:58:37] <shoky> venus_: if ( !$('#div1').length ) $('#div2').hide()
[08:58:42] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: how can i set the color of the underline?
[08:58:56] <sunbeam> (should be different than the <a> color)(
[09:04:08] <slick-> anyone know how i can make cafes a variable $("span[data-cat=cafes]").find(".numbered-rounded").text(x)
[09:06:41] <VancyPants> Hey guys, I have to create a function that I'm not certain where to start. I need to iterate through each link in a list, analyze the href attribute, if the root URL = http://theurlIneed, then analyze to see if theres a query string in that URL, if there is, add &query=1, and if not, append ?query=1
[09:06:43] <faraway> slick-: $("span[data-cat="+var+"]") ...   ????
[09:06:48] <VancyPants> any ideas? I'm not certain where to start for that.
[09:07:42] <slick-> thx!
[09:09:07] <shoky> VancyPants: start with the first step. you named a few
[09:09:40] <VancyPants> yeah so i'm using .each(), then I'm getting the .attr("href"),
[09:09:50] <shoky> so you do know where to start..
[09:10:03] <shoky> why ask such a vague question then?
[09:10:14] <VancyPants> yeah i know where to start... I've googled for the query string bit and theres no clear consensus on how to handle it
[09:10:39] <shoky> you said exactly what you want/need to do with the string
[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Thoughts on just dropping the conditional completely?
[09:10:47] <shoky> just need to translate it into code..
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Running the selector unconditionally won't be a perf issue.
[09:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: That's the logic I used for the rewrite.
[09:11:18] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: oh, then that would work as well. I guess it's a pretty tiny micro-optimization to even have the check there
[09:11:31] <jscheel> negated by the check too :)
[09:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Don't worry about sending a new PR. I'll just make the change and set you as the author.
[09:11:55] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: cool, thanks
[09:13:25] <faraway> VancyPants: what is not clear about the query string ?
[09:16:23] <sjeijk> can i ask some1 to look at this http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/14/ my first plugin, very simple (20 lines) but I'm interested if its considered bad or good code
[09:17:31] <piotr_> I have an event listener for a next button, when clicked I want to replace the body content with 'Thank you', but I get this error "TypeError: handleObj is undefined if ( ( mappedTypes || origType === handleObj.origType ) &&" on line 2796 of the latest version of jquery
[09:18:34] <Eviltwin> piotr_: Damn it, did you break jQuery?
[09:18:48] <ak> ?demo
[09:18:49] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:19:06] <ak> piotr_: ^^^
[09:21:31] <faraway> sjeijk: bad code
[09:21:44] <shoky> ^^
[09:22:11] <rmurphey> sjeijk: you should read up on variable scope in js
[09:22:13] <sjeijk> this better http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/16/ ?
[09:22:17] <sjeijk> ok
[09:22:34] <faraway> sjeijk: rmurphey said why it is bad
[09:22:35] <rmurphey> also, in a plugin, you don't need to do $(this), as this is already a jq object
[09:23:11] <rmurphey> also, it's bad form not to return this from a plugin
[09:23:15] <rmurphey> because it makes it unchainable
[09:23:28] <faraway> sjeijk: and the $ signs in fornt of the vars looks strange, you normaly don'T see that in js code
[09:23:34] <rmurphey> have you read http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring ?
[09:23:44] <rmurphey> faraway: that is more a matter of taste, plenty of people do it
[09:23:52] <silverwind> faraway: I don't like it but I see that all the time..
[09:23:53] <rmurphey> basically a variant of hungarian notation
[09:24:16] <sjeijk> ok lemme check those docs, tx for your feedback
[09:25:23] <faraway> rmurphey, silverwind : well yes you can name the variable the way you want, that true ^^
[09:26:15] <ak> hmm, i use $var for only jquery objects, and i think it's a nice thing to have...
[09:26:48] <ak> so people expect a jquery object in the variable...
[09:27:23] <Eviltwin> But you don't use Hungarian notation elsewhere? Shame on you!
[09:27:38] <ak> i don't know what hungarian notation is :(
[09:27:45] <ak> but i will google it
[09:28:00] <Eviltwin> It's where variables are annotated with what type they are
[09:28:07] <Eviltwin> Like var nMyVarName = 12;
[09:28:14] <Eviltwin> var oMyOtherVarName = {...};
[09:28:24] <Eviltwin> var bMyBooleanVarName = true;
[09:28:44] <piotr_> ak: http://jsfiddle.net/ehEsg/ -- its long
[09:28:58] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ piotr_
[09:28:59] <bot-t> piotr_, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[09:29:30] <piotr_> basically at the end of the question (there are ony a few) it should print "new content" after clicking the last button (you'll know it's the last button when clicking next  no longer works)
[09:29:36] <ak> Ewiltwin just got wikipedia on it :)
[09:29:55] <piotr_> so look at  $("#nextButton").click(function() {...}, I call exitFlow() which causes the error
[09:30:01] <piotr_> Eviltwin: check it out
[09:30:10] <sjeijk> so am I correct that var a = local and a = global scope?
[09:31:03] <sjeijk> so that http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/17/ is better with the scope of my variables?
[09:31:03] <slick-> this code is supposed to interate through and set the x as the value
[09:31:07] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/gfKCD/
[09:31:14] <slick-> but it only sets the final value of x
[09:31:17] <slick-> to everything
[09:31:57] <ak> piotr_: iÃ„m on it...
[09:32:18] <piotr_> ak: OK, thanks
[09:32:22] <slick-> anyone know why the x value is set as the final one
[09:32:25] <slick-> and not iterated through
[09:32:25] <faraway> sjeijk: you need to read a little bit more about scopes but the code with the var ok
[09:33:03] <christoph1er> Hello Jquery, Im trying to use the animate function. And ive gone completely back to basics, with a brand new square black div, and simply nothing happens. No errors. Just nothing
[09:33:06] <piotr_> ak: sorry I put all the JS in the html; I have that split in 3 files
[09:33:13] <christoph1er> :(
[09:33:17] <christoph1er> makes me sad
[09:33:21] <walidvb> anyone familiar with officialfm player? i have this really weird error here: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/N2chK/1/
[09:33:56] <talntidd> i see no error
[09:33:58] <talntidd> it works for me
[09:34:23] <sjeijk> ok tx faraway and rmurphey
[09:34:29] <slick-> talntidd: can u pls help me with this?  http://jsfiddle.net/gfKCD/  is supposed to iterate through and set the x value as it goes
[09:34:35] <slick-> but it only sets the final x value to all of them
[09:34:39] <christoph1er> oh well, im going to finish work then
[09:35:42] <jacoluta> where are u setting category_name?
[09:35:59] <rmurphey> ?demo @ christoph1er
[09:35:59] <jacoluta> $("span[data-cat=" + category_name + "]")
[09:35:59] <bot-t> christoph1er, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:36:05] <jacoluta> that seems to be statci
[09:36:07] <jacoluta> static
[09:36:27] <jacoluta> so each time u iterate it gets overwritten with the successive x value
[09:36:38] <optraz> how do i check if a variable has been altered its value?
[09:36:51] <Eviltwin> piotr_: The problem stems from your Object.prototype.formatMapValues = function(...) { ... };
[09:37:07] <talntidd> sorry guys, I have enough trouble making my own stuff work... :P I'm not real useful as a helper...
[09:37:15] <faraway> sjeijk: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/sagc3/1/
[09:37:16] <Eviltwin> piotr_: Why have you added all these things to your prototype?
[09:37:21] <talntidd> I can figure anything out, but it takes a bunch of time. lol
[09:37:22] <shoky> sjeijk this is a bit nicer and also works on multiple fields http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/wYdfD/20/
[09:37:43] <shoky> so, a more "complete" plugin
[09:38:07] <walidvb> talntidd: second player isnt loading
[09:38:16] <sjeijk> wow tx
[09:38:42] <slick-> jacoluta: the problem is with the x variable
[09:38:50] <faraway> sjeijk: just to illustrate that you really need to learn the scoping of js
[09:39:09] <Houman> Hi, How do I get a reference to the row I just insert with 'row.before(result);'
[09:39:48] <Houman> I tried var row_before = row.before(result);  but thats not the expected row.
[09:40:03] <talntidd> wachpwnski, invalid track id.
[09:40:09] <shoky> Houman: uhh. 'result'  ?
[09:40:17] <talntidd> wachpwnski: http://jsfiddle.net/N2chK/2/
[09:40:33] <sjeijk> so as long as you put var in front of it, it's going to be - depending where you put it - more locally
[09:40:35] <piotr_> Eviltwin: I added the formatValues because I have the object called choices, like choices = { 'exemptRange': "Less than {0}", ...} -- I take that string and format it so {0} becomes some number
[09:40:37] <shoky> oh result is html prolly
[09:40:42] <Houman> shoky: result is simply a piece of html (got by ajax) its <tr>
[09:41:07] <shoky> Houman: i'd go with  var row_before = $(result).insertBefore(row)
[09:41:18] <ak> piotr_: try maybe to move everything into a container div, not the  body element, and try to empty it...
[09:41:26] <Houman> shoky: interesting. let me try...
[09:41:37] <walidvb> talntidd: that's my point, the track id is correct, or at least the url works
[09:41:40] * sjeijk should review a lot of his code he recently wrote :s
[09:42:38] <piotr_> sjeijk: mine? go ahead
[09:43:05] <Houman> shoky: You are my hero. :)
[09:43:21] <shoky> ;]
[09:43:23] <sjeijk> no no, a lot of code I recently wrote is bad i just learned
[09:43:34] <sjeijk> cuz of this scope thing
[09:43:37] <talntidd> walidvb, just saying.. it works with a valid track id...
[09:44:21] <piotr_> ak: hmm, I tried that, and same thing
[09:44:52] <walidvb> talntidd: cheers. i know, i used it for a long time, and track ids always were ####, now they have letters as well, and it seems to have stopped working :(
[09:45:05] <walidvb> and i can't find the doc
[09:45:21] <ak> piotr_: i just used $('div.container').deatch() and it works like this...
[09:45:34] <ak> (and put everything into that div)
[09:46:21] <slick-> hey can someone please tell me why the x value is not set as it goes
[09:46:23] <ak> piotr_: http://jsfiddle.net/keriati/ehEsg/1/
[09:46:24] <slick-> but the final value is set
[09:46:25] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/gfKCD/
[09:46:52] <ak> piotr_: and i still don't know why your solution wouldn't work :(
[09:47:09] <talntidd> walidvb, hmm... I'd try emailing them maybe?
[09:47:22] <walidvb> done, twitter as well
[09:50:26] <piotr_> ak: thanks, I got yours to work.. perplexing huh
[09:50:39] <piotr_> Eviltwin: why is it caused by formatMapValues?
[09:52:25] <Pietertje> hi
[09:52:32] <Pietertje> does jquery come with a popup ?
[09:53:20] <piotr_> ak: I just suppose you have to detach.. I tried calling .off('click') on each button, and also looked for a way to just kill jquery, but thanks
[10:11:52] <Eviltwin> piotr_: Look at the first issue: http://docs.jquery.com/Won%27t_Fix
[10:13:24] <piotr_> Eviltwin: ah I see, very good to know, thanks
[10:15:27] <Eviltwin> piotr_: You can rewrite these functions so that instead of foo.myMethod(bar) they're myMethod(foo, bar)
[10:15:37] <Eviltwin> This is generally considered a better practice
[10:16:00] <Eviltwin> When foo is of type Object, and not some subclass
[10:17:11] <piotr_> Eviltwin: yeah I will, I don't know why I did that
[10:26:00] <optraz> how do i pass javascript variable into jquery?
[10:26:53] <optraz> $.ajax({ type: "POST", url : "test.php", data: { segment1 }, }); where segment1 is the javascript variable
[10:26:54] <ryanneufeld> optraz: Shout "jQuery go long!" And then throw it.
[10:27:06] <optraz> wtf?
[10:27:08] <ryanneufeld> lol
[10:27:11] <ryanneufeld> I'm kidding
[10:27:17] <optraz> not funny
[10:27:22] <ryanneufeld> where is segment1?
[10:27:27] <toddWork> i like to declare my vars like so: var myVar = "myvar";
[10:27:28] <ryanneufeld> *where is segment1 defined?
[10:28:10] <optraz> ryanneufeld: outside the block $(document).ready(function () {
[10:28:20] <ryanneufeld> so it's global
[10:28:24] <ryanneufeld> it should work then
[10:28:24] <piotr_> Eviltwin: what about extending String prototype?
[10:28:32] <optraz> ryanneufeld: no, it does not
[10:28:42] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @optraz
[10:28:42] <bot-t> optraz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:32:36] <optraz> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/r6R5J/1/
[10:33:31] <ryanneufeld> optraz: data: is expecting an object
[10:33:46] <Eviltwin> piotr_: It's less evil but it's still better to use the func(a, b) format when possible
[10:33:51] <ryanneufeld> optraz: http://jsfiddle.net/r6R5J/6/ try that
[10:34:05] <piotr_> Eviltwin: yeah I suppose
[10:35:30] <optraz> ryanneufeld: i see.. thanks mate..
[10:35:36] <optraz> gotta sleep... too tired
[10:35:38] <optraz> brqain stop working
[10:35:44] <ryanneufeld> optraz: np, been there dude
[10:43:13] <chadams42> jquery or dojo
[10:46:37] <Heather_> what is the best way to identify a html element if its part of php array i.e the element is generated several times with the same class name. I want to alter one of these elements which all have the same class name specifcally @ an ajax callback function.
[10:47:09] <Eviltwin> Did the AJAX originate through some action within that element?
[10:47:37] <Heather_> no
[10:47:51] <Eviltwin> So how do you know which one you're trying to remove?
[10:48:56] <Heather_> not sure new to client-side design, any tips how to avoid this kind of problem?
[10:49:24] <Eviltwin> Use a counter in PHP to give them all different IDs?
[10:49:29] <Eviltwin> foo1, foo2, foo3, ...
[10:53:55] <NoiseEee> Heather_: consider writing the element with a "data-" attribute.
[10:54:09] <NoiseEee> Heather_: <element class='sameAsManyOthers' data-referenceID='14412'>
[10:55:34] <Heather_> okay thanks
[11:00:57] <Cameron__> how can i get the current directory of the included file?
[11:02:55] <Eviltwin> Cameron__: Uh... what?
[11:03:13] <Cameron__> nevermind actually
[11:08:45] <Nullpointerz> hi
[11:09:52] <Ayush> Hello
[11:10:34] <Nullpointerz> I'm having a problem with element.height()
[11:10:36] <Ayush> How can i select div element order by z-index style property ? any metord to do so ?
[11:10:54] <Ayush> use $(element).height()
[11:11:07] <Nullpointerz> well, it works
[11:11:12] <Nullpointerz> but it kind of lies a little
[11:11:32] <Ayush> element = $(element);
[11:11:32] <Ayush> element.height();
[11:11:35] <Ayush> another way for u
[11:11:39] <Ayush> lol
[11:12:34] <Nullpointerz> Meh
[11:12:37] <Nullpointerz> First time
[11:12:44] <Nullpointerz> it'll work as it's supposed to
[11:12:55] <Nullpointerz> using slideDown btw
[11:13:21] <Nullpointerz> second time, it returns something that its not its real height
[11:13:34] <Nullpointerz> so the slideDown kind of jumps from middle to end
[11:13:54] <Ayush> u are calling it in slideDown
[11:14:00] <Nullpointerz> no
[11:14:02] <Ayush> or after slideDown ?
[11:14:05] <Nullpointerz> slideDown is calling it
[11:14:09] <Ayush> oh..
[11:14:16] <Nullpointerz> Made it log the height value
[11:14:25] <Cyph0n> Can anyone tell me why this code won't run? http://bpaste.net/show/G1HJRN1MWRTa3RWLyz19/
[11:14:25] <Nullpointerz> on first run it's 545px
[11:14:25] <Ayush> like slideDown(function() { }) ?
[11:14:30] <Nullpointerz> no
[11:14:33] <Nullpointerz> edited the source
[11:14:36] <Nullpointerz> to add logging
[11:14:42] <Nullpointerz> first run it's 545
[11:15:05] <Nullpointerz> after sliding up again, and running again it logs the height 4 times: 280, 200, 15, 50
[11:15:29] <Nullpointerz> does the latter one until I refresh the page
[11:15:45] <Nullpointerz> so I was wondering, could I delete some values it might've set?
[11:15:46] <Ayush> after doing slideup height will not work coz element get hidden..
[11:15:56] <drspin> hi there -- trying to do this $("#sel").html(<img src=\"https://......\">")
[11:16:01] <Nullpointerz> yes, it wont
[11:16:21] <Nullpointerz> but doesn't slideDown show it first, then get the height real quick and then animate?
[11:16:25] <drspin> and I get http://localhost....https... etc instead of just the https
[11:16:31] <drspin> not sure what I'm missing
[11:17:11] <Nullpointerz> youre missing a quote from after html(
[11:17:14] <Ayush> Nullpointerz: show the fiddle
[11:17:55] <Ayush> drspin: you must close the src attitube
[11:17:57] <Nullpointerz> the code or the page?
[11:18:34] <Ayush> Nullpointerz: code which in which you have problem
[11:18:54] <drspin> Ayush: yes, I have a closing tag
[11:19:34] <Ayush> $("#sel").html('<img src="https://......">') try this instead drspin
[11:19:39] <Cyph0n> try using single quotes to wrap the <img />
[11:21:04] <Nullpointerz> http://pastie.org/private/y5ezqyxxtsuestgunk8nvq
[11:21:09] <drspin> Ayush: ok that works! thank you
[11:21:16] <Nullpointerz> line 268 is the slideDown method
[11:21:38] <drspin> Cyph0n: thanks! that works
[11:21:40] <Nullpointerz> toggleMore is used on line 324
[11:24:29] <Ayush>  Nullpointerz so what problem you are getting in that line of code?
[11:26:22] <Nullpointerz> lol
[11:26:33] <Nullpointerz> the problem is in jquery methods I'm sure
[11:26:57] <Nullpointerz> height() returns wrong value for some reason
[11:28:17] <Cyph0n> Again, could anyone help me out with this piece of JS? http://bpaste.net/show/G1HJRN1MWRTa3RWLyz19/
[11:28:17] <Ayush>  where u using
[11:28:20] <Ayush> hight value?
[11:28:35] <rgr> I have a fnction name in a string var, I wish to call it as a jQuery.fn e.g jQuery.fn.myFunc = function(){}.  var f ="myFunc". How to call it?
[11:29:02] <Eviltwin> ?object @ rgr
[11:29:03] <bot-t> rgr, object.foo === object["foo"]
[11:29:07] <Cyph0n> All I'm trying to do is increase or decrease the font size of text on a page using two buttons.
[11:29:08] <Nullpointerz> i'm not using it, jquery is
[11:29:31] <rgr> Eviltwin: excuse my denseness but I dont see the relevance.
[11:29:33] <Nullpointerz> I'll try to use js style method for this
[11:29:45] <ak> rgr: jQuery.fn[f]()
[11:29:47] <Eviltwin> rgr: jQuery.fn["myFunc"]
[11:29:58] <rgr> oh right. Makes sense. cheers
[11:30:14] <wolfehr> in an html fragment of $('<div class="section"></div<div class="section"></div>'), how can you iterate through the divs (is find applicable, as it doesn't seem to be working as expected for me)
[11:30:31] <wolfehr> *the html is well formed ignore my closing bracked
[11:30:55] <ak> wolfehr: $.each()
[11:31:20] <rgr> hmm m y js lint doesnt like that
[11:31:44] <ak> rgr: try jshint :)
[11:32:07] <rgr> I think it is using flymake in emacs. I'll check later.
[11:32:18] <wolfehr> isn't each in the format $().something('selector').each() ?
[11:32:37] <ak> wolfehr: it has some formats...
[11:33:33] <Cyph0n> is += valid in JS?
[11:34:02] <wolfehr> I don't get how I can apply it to this instance $(htmlFragment).children('.selector').each(function(){}) for example, but I can't use a function as all of the elements are top level with no parent
[11:34:59] <ak> wolfehr: $('<div class="section"></div<div class="section"></div>').each(function(index, element) { do something with element});
[11:35:15] <ak> i think this should work
[11:35:20] <wolfehr> that doesn't let me filter by the section class though
[11:35:44] <ak> wolfehr: $('<div class="section"></div<div class="section"></div>').filter('.section').each(function(index, element) { do something with element});
[11:35:56] <wolfehr> does filter work on top level elements then?
[11:36:06] <ak> it should
[11:37:54] <ak> wolfehr: just so you get it, everything works with "top level" elements
[11:38:08] <ak> wolfehr: you don't need .find()...
[11:39:15] <Gho5t> Any guesses as to why when I click on a button with my mouse nothing happens but when I trigger it's click() in the console something does?
[11:39:27] <Gho5t> I thought it might be a z-index issue but no luck.
[11:39:43] <rgr> so this should work? var f = jQuery.fn[toggleFunc];
[11:39:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone experience with jEditiable
[11:39:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[11:41:11] <rgr> ecky--ptang-zoob: best just to ask you Q as opposed to the generic "has anyone used this". State your problem.
[11:41:23] <Eviltwin> rgr: Yes
[11:41:49] <rgr> heh, this new laptops keyboard s driving me around the twist.. ;)
[11:41:53] <ak> ?demo
[11:41:53] <Eviltwin> But f(...) probably won't do what you expect
[11:41:53] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:42:00] <ak> Gho5t: ^^^^
[11:42:41] <Gho5t> yeah
[11:42:42] <mykul> yo
[11:42:51] <mykul> hnng wrongchan
[11:42:53] <Gho5t> you can't mock everything
[11:43:13] <ak> and you can't help everyone ;)
[11:43:29] <Gho5t> : )
[11:43:46] <Gho5t> you could throw out some ideas
[11:44:00] <Gho5t> like "check the z-index"
[11:44:06] <Gho5t> does it have a width and height
[11:44:08] <Gho5t> etc
[11:44:09] <ak> something is "over" the thing? :O
[11:44:15] <Eviltwin> Gho5t: Check the z-index
[11:44:19] <Gho5t> danke
[11:44:21] <Gho5t> will do
[11:45:03] <danheberden> at first i thought your name was "ghost" but then i noticed what i thought was an 'S' was the number five! You pulled a fast on on me!

I've tried to create manually the same divs as the jquery Instagram generates and use the slide plugin on that and it does work. Hope someone understands what I'm saying. :)

[11:47:21] <nprasath0021> Hi i am using jquery hovercards in my wordpress site. .append() is not showing the changes in the hover card. any idea why this is happening?
[11:47:30] <nprasath0021> how do i debug it?
[11:47:42] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ nprasath0021
[11:47:43] <bot-t> nprasath0021, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:48:01] <ak> this bot-t is awesome
[11:48:18] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: Thanks :)
[11:51:11] <Gho5t> danheberden: yes, thank you. I am very crafty
[11:53:04] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: I logged the element and it shows all the appended elements. but the hovercard is not showing the changes?
[11:53:25] <Eviltwin> Then you probably have a CSS problem or something
[11:58:03] <Gho5t> twas the fact taht my handler was bound before the widget was created
[11:58:16] <Gho5t> i still don't get why firing the click in the console worked though
[11:58:19] <Gho5t> oh well
[12:06:20] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: i tried view source in the hovercard the appended elements are not there. but console.log showed all the elements
[12:06:36] <Eviltwin> View Source does not update when you modify the DOM
[12:06:53] <Eviltwin> It contains only the code sent by the server
[12:08:05] <Eviltwin> Consider this: http://jsfiddle.net/MQskH/show/
[12:09:34] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: http://designwithpc.com/Plugins/Hovercard example 5 listed here loads data dynamically and view source shows the data loaded
[12:10:37] <Eviltwin> nprasath0021: The View Source shows his tweets?
[12:11:14] <nprasath0021> yes try the example 5
[12:11:46] <Eviltwin> Yes, I did and when I clicked View Source, I didn't see his tweets in there
[12:12:59] <LessSeen> anyone know if there is a jquerytools chan?
[12:15:12] <rmill> LessSeen: don't use that POS!
[12:16:14] <rmill> jQueryTools. God damn. .overlay() binds _and_ returns NOTHING
[12:16:55] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: When the hover cards loads how tweets rightclik on one tweet and inspect element?
[12:17:06] <BinaryKitten> rmill?
[12:17:14] <Eviltwin> nprasath0021: Inspect Element != View Source
[12:17:50] <rmill> BinaryKitten: I'm just not a fan of jQueryTools
[12:18:10] <rmill> jQueryUI > jQueryTools
[12:18:14] <LessSeen> ok, it was in use on a legacy project
[12:18:16] <tw2113> i remember when i didn't understand inspect vs view source
[12:18:29] <tw2113> i didn't realize that inspect involved js changes etc
[12:18:40] <LessSeen> and the core of it needs a couple fixes
[12:18:44] <rmill> LessSeen, jQuery Tools hasn't been updated in a long time either, as far as I know.
[12:19:20] <LessSeen> good to know
[12:19:21] <BinaryKitten> rmill it's in the works for update
[12:19:38] <BinaryKitten> but the last release still works 99.9% fine with 1.8
[12:19:40] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: ah.I am sorry to bother you this much. is there any alternative for append?
[12:19:50] <rmill> BinaryKitten: do you work on it, or something?
[12:19:51] <LessSeen> i think it has some nice looking things, but it needs some fixes
[12:20:06] <Eviltwin> nprasath0021: Sure see ?g mdn appendChild
[12:20:07] <bot-t> nprasath0021, Node.appendChild | Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.appendChild
[12:20:10] <BinaryKitten> rmill i use it on a legacy project
[12:20:15] <Eviltwin> But I don't think .append is your problem
[12:20:19] <BinaryKitten> and can't switch it out
[12:20:23] <Eviltwin> Unless you're using it wrong
[12:20:24] <BinaryKitten> so have gotten used to it
[12:20:28] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: CSS issue?
[12:20:44] <rmill> I just wish it maintained conventions, like .overlay(), for example... You would think that method would actually _make_ an overlay...
[12:21:14] <BinaryKitten> it sort of does
[12:21:19] <LessSeen> anyway i don't see a chan about it on freenode so far
[12:21:23] <BinaryKitten> just doesn't auto show it
[12:21:27] <rmill> Anyway, I get that people use it, because it Just Worksâ„¢, but I wouldn't suggest it to anybody.
[12:22:22] <Eviltwin> nprasath0021: Here's an example of a CSS issue: http://jsfiddle.net/cLUxM/
[12:24:33] <nprasath0021> Eviltwin: thanks :)
[12:39:14] <Bish> hi, i tried to rotate an element with .css({'-webkit-transform':'rotate(90deg)'}); this works with EVRY element, but not the ones i added to the dome with my content script
[12:39:33] <Bish> could someone lead me into the right direction
[12:41:03] <Bish> i can even do that with $(body).css(...) and it will get rotated, the whole thing
[12:43:23] <BinaryKitten> Bish
[12:43:33] <BinaryKitten> how & when are you doing that
[12:43:59] <Nathan2055> Can I have some assistance with making a dialog?
[12:44:12] <Nathan2055> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nathan2055/afc_releasecandidate.js
[12:44:38] <Nathan2055> This script used to use "jsMsg" for the dialogs, but a recent patch to MediaWiki broke that.
[12:45:01] <Nathan2055> So, I'm rewriting it using "jquery.ui.dialog".
[12:45:22] <Bish> BinaryKitten, imagine it like this: $(document).ready(function(){ var elem = $('<span></span>').css{'-webkit-transform':'rotate(90deg)'};$('body').append(elem);})
[12:45:24] <Nathan2055> I've copied that over all of the current instances of "jsMsg", what is the next step?
[12:45:49] <rgr> when calling a func through a string var thus 'jQuery.fn[funcname]' how do I pass the selector? If I add (el) to the call I get a typeerror.
[12:46:23] <BinaryKitten> Bish siwtch that out a bit
[12:46:44] <BinaryKitten> $('<span></span>').appendTo(document.body).css.......
[12:46:51] <Nathan2055> Anybody?
[12:50:58] <Bish> BinaryKitten, just to tryout, or why?
[12:51:23] <Nathan2055> Can anybody help me?
[12:51:43] <BinaryKitten> thinking bish that that particular transformation requires the element to be in the dom
[12:52:00] <Bish> that's what i thought too, but didnt work
[12:52:06] <Bish> container.appendTo(v.pti.children().eq(0)).css({'-webkit-transform':'rotateX(180deg)'}); doing this right now
[12:52:31] <Bish> also: when im trying it with the chrome inspector, i can rotate any element on the page, but the ones i added
[12:52:46] <BinaryKitten> yeah as they're in the dom
[12:53:08] <Bish> yeah well, mine are in the dom, too
[12:53:15] <Bish> already.. they got added, they simply won't get rotated
[12:53:26] <Bish> and i can't return them with the inspector either
[12:53:31] <Bish> s/return/rotate
[12:53:32] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[12:53:49] <BinaryKitten> don't know then
[12:53:54] <Bish> :'(
[12:53:57] <Bish> thank you BinaryKitten
[12:54:00] <BinaryKitten> what about making the css a class?
[12:54:07] <Bish> will try
[12:54:17] <BinaryKitten> .rotated90 { ..... }
[12:54:24] <BinaryKitten> then add the class to the element
[12:55:15] <Nathan2055> This is ridiculous! Can I have help?
[12:55:56] <BinaryKitten> sorry Nathan2055
[12:56:05] <BinaryKitten> only myself on duty for help tonight
[12:56:14] <BinaryKitten> and only have one brain cell
[12:56:21] <Nathan2055> Ah, okay.
[12:56:30] <Nathan2055> It's 4PM where I am.
[12:56:38] <BinaryKitten> 20:56 here
[12:57:31] <Nathan2055> Anyway, what should I do next?
[12:58:14] <Bish> BinaryKitten, :( doesn't work either, added the class to a random elem on the page -> works
[12:58:32] <BinaryKitten> so. what else is on those elements
[12:58:45] <BinaryKitten> Nathan2055 have you looked at the demos? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[12:58:49] <Bish> they were there from the beginning, only difference
[12:59:02] <Nathan2055> Yeah.
[12:59:11] <Bish> but i can't manipulate that, since im injecting the script with chrome plugin
[12:59:19] <BinaryKitten> ok so Nathan2055 where are you stuck?
[12:59:36] <BinaryKitten> oh, that might be a completely separate issue
[12:59:39] <Nathan2055> The script is massive, so with my limited JS experience I don't want to risk destroying anything.
[12:59:55] <BinaryKitten> ah Nathan2055 that becomes the problem
[13:00:07] <BinaryKitten> bish: origin might be the issue
[13:00:15] <Nathan2055> ?
[13:02:12] <rgr> when calling a func through a string var thus 'jQuery.fn[funcname]' how do I pass the selector? If I add (el) to the call I get a typeerror.
[13:02:32] <Bish> BinaryKitten, :(
[13:02:50] <BinaryKitten> rgr that's the thing you don't call it like that normally
[13:02:56] <rgr> I also tried $(selector)[funcname] and while there is no error the function references by funcname isnt called
[13:03:14] <shoky> rgr: $(selector)[funcname]()
[13:03:16] <BinaryKitten> rgr have you tried $(selector).fn[funcname] ?
[13:03:19] <Eviltwin> rgr: Here's a very elaborate example: http://jsfiddle.net/GpGMu/
[13:03:20] <rgr> argh
[13:03:23] <rgr> thanks brb
[13:04:39] <BinaryKitten> Nathan2055 since i can't/won't edit the script i can only help with direct issues
[13:04:42] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[13:05:08] <rgr> BinaryKitten: thanks. Im an idiot. I missed the () ...
[13:05:15] <Nathan2055> Okay.
[13:05:22] <BinaryKitten> rgr :D
[13:05:40] <BinaryKitten> rgr actually i would split it to 2 lines
[13:05:47] <Eviltwin> rgr: Basically doing $("#foo").slideToggle instead of $("#foo").slideToggle() ?
[13:06:04] <BinaryKitten> var myFunc = $(selector).fn[funcname];  myFunc();
[13:06:17] <shoky> not .fn ..
[13:06:28] <rgr> this does it and fits in : var f =  el[toggleFunc]();
[13:06:37] <rgr> cheers guys
[13:06:38] <Eviltwin> That's fine
[13:06:48] <Eviltwin> var f = el[toggleFunc]; f(); won't
[13:06:54] <Bish> http://jsfiddle.net/4Yw2x/6/
[13:07:02] <Bish> BinaryKitten,  :(
[13:07:04] <BinaryKitten> no Eviltwin?
[13:07:10] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: Try it
[13:07:18] * BinaryKitten is too tired
[13:07:39] <BinaryKitten> i'll assume you're as correct as you usually are
[13:07:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How come this is not working? document.getElementById("date_default_" + idarray[1]).innerHTML
[13:07:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> TypeError: document.getElementById("date_default_" + idarray[1]) is null
[13:08:03] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/UjTcN/
[13:08:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> idarray[1] is set
[13:08:21] <Eviltwin> ecky--ptang-zoob: Please see #javascript
[13:08:28] <Eviltwin> Since you're using JavaScript
[13:08:35] <Eviltwin> Not jQuery
[13:08:51] <BinaryKitten> if you do, there could be a shrubbery in it for you ecky--ptang-zoob
[13:09:33] * BinaryKitten calls it a night
[13:10:03] <Zzaichik> although you should be using jQuery. whatever...
[13:10:14] <Bish> BinaryKitten, it appears you can't rotate display:inline stuff
[13:10:18] <Bish> does that makes sense to you?
[13:10:25] <Zzaichik> those JavaQueries are goodtimes for me
[13:10:32] <Eviltwin> Bish: What happens if you do position: relative
[13:10:44] <Bish> works
[13:10:51] <Bish> http://jsfiddle.net/4Yw2x/10/ try it
[13:11:25] <Zzaichik> display inline things technically do not take up space in the realm of block elements.
[13:11:58] <Eviltwin> Bish: Looks like you want inline-block
[13:12:08] <Zzaichik> Bish: or BinaryKitten:  you would have to change display:inline to inline-block or block
[13:12:15] <Bish> cool let's try that
[13:12:16] <Zzaichik> Eviltwin:  beat me to it.
[13:12:30] <rgr> hmm. maybe not. the element thats in toggleFunc is the element it was called from and not the selector I used. aargh. Ill start agan tomorow.
[13:13:04] <Eviltwin> rgr: I don't understand what you're trying to do
[13:14:42] <Bish> what does inline-block exactly do, since it's not getting display'ed anymore ( it was a span before )
[13:14:54] <Eviltwin> It makes it a block that's inline
[13:15:04] <rgr> call a function through a variable name but thaf function has the $(this) context but not of the called, but rather of the element it is called for. hard to explain and not really fiddleable.
[13:15:11] <Nathan2055> BinaryKitten: Okay, I made some modifications but FFs error console says "Error: TypeError: $("#dialog").jquery.ui is undefined". What should I do?
[13:15:34] <Eviltwin> rgr: You seem to be trying to speak in generics, try talking in specfics instead
[13:16:33] <rgr> eg: var f =  el[toggleFunc](); explanation : tooglefunc="myfunc". defined as jQuery.fn.myfunc= function(){blah();}
[13:17:05] <Eviltwin> Yes but why? What's the actual goal?
[13:17:23] <Eviltwin> People usually don't just replace functions for kicks
[13:17:55] <rgr> Nothing is replaced. The functon called is an attribute of the element. different elements call different functions.
[13:18:48] <rgr> (in this case all elements are toggle items (a class) which need to call element specific toggle functions.
[13:18:56] <Nathan2055> BinaryKitten: ping
[13:19:56] <Mr_Grim> dumb question? how do i clear the selection of a <select> element?
[13:22:16] <Bish> hm, why do i only see the background oft the inline-block if it has content?
[13:25:11] <rogeruiz> mr_grim: check which item has an attribute of checked="checked" and remove that attribute
[13:25:16] <rogeruiz> that should work
[13:25:35] <NoiseEee> (selected='selected')
[13:25:36] <rogeruiz> you'll need to $('.selector').each it
[13:25:56] <NoiseEee> Mr_Grim: or by 'clear the selection' do you mean erase all <option>s?
[13:25:57] <rogeruiz> is that the syntax, noiseeee?
[13:26:25] <NoiseEee> rogeruiz: no, just remarking that <options> are selected and not checked.
[13:26:53] <rogeruiz> right. thanks
[13:27:10] <rogeruiz> dealing with too many checkboxes ATM
[13:28:10] <rogeruiz> mr_grim: from the MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/option
[13:28:29] <rogeruiz> https://gist.github.com/5f1eed9ffb012da18f14
[13:28:57] <shoky> assuming your options have values and the default selection has an empty value... $('select').val('')
[13:29:19] <shoky> and if you wanted to select the selected option, no need for .each,  $('select option:selected')
[13:29:52] <Mr_Grim> i just want to clear the selection of a specific select element
[13:29:55] <Mr_Grim> i dont want to remove options
[13:30:03] <shoky> what does clear the selection mean exactly?
[13:30:06] <Mr_Grim> just remove the selected attribute for all options
[13:30:31] <shoky> one of them has to be selected..
[13:30:33] <shoky> i think?
[13:30:33] <Mr_Grim> shoky when you select something from a drop down, i just want to reset that
[13:30:40] <Mr_Grim> thats it
[13:31:01] <shoky> do your options have values?
[13:31:22] <rogeruiz> mr_grim, just grab all the option elements and remove the attribute and that'll do it.
[13:31:53] <rogeruiz> shoky's example is better
[13:32:08] <NoiseEee> $(selectElemet).val(whateverTheDefaultIs)
[13:32:20] <shoky> that
[13:33:34] <Mr_Grim> NoiseEeeill try that again
[13:33:36] <Mr_Grim> i did try that
[13:33:44] <Mr_Grim> i mean NoiseEee
[13:34:06] <Eviltwin> rgr: http://jsfiddle.net/Dg5pb/
[13:34:13] <Eviltwin> Damn
[13:34:19] <Eviltwin> bot-t: tell rgr http://jsfiddle.net/Dg5pb/
[13:34:20] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Okay.
[13:34:29] <shoky> hate when that happens.
[13:34:41] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[13:35:53] <Eviltwin> We need to modify Freenode so that if we're working on a solution for someone, it won't let them quit
[13:36:00] <shoky> lol
[13:38:22] <Bish> one problem left: the background of an inline-block seems to be not displayed if it has no content; but i want it that way
[13:38:58] <shoky> did you give it dimensions
[13:39:59] <Bish> what a stupid question ofcouse i di.. no i didn't
[13:40:09] <shoky> wat.
[13:40:09] <b-ot> life is hard...  be alive is funny... sufferin for other happyness is a non sense
[13:40:18] <Eviltwin> Uh
[13:40:24] <Bish> shoky, a joke
[13:40:26] <Eviltwin> Interesting
[13:40:43] <shoky> still wat.
[13:46:40] <Mr_Grim> is there a change event for <select /> elements?
[13:46:44] <Mr_Grim> like a .click event?
[13:46:54] <Mr_Grim> with regular JS I used onchange
[13:48:10] <shoky> Mr_Grim yes, change
[13:48:10] <NoiseEee> Mr_Grim: ideally you call the handler/function that you want to fire, and not trigger the event to call the handler
[13:48:22] <NoiseEee> Mr_Grim: personally i've always hated simulating events to get things to work
[13:48:33] <shoky> dont think he was asking about simulating/triggering
[13:56:53] <nsanden> Hi guys, i'm trying to use this example but its not working. http://stackoverflow.com/a/4058860  - here is my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CGYmx/7/, anyone know what the issue is or similar code that will do the same thing? basically i want my <a href="http://link" id="link1">test</a> to open a modal dialog with the html from http://link as the contents
[13:57:54] <toddWork> i need to ask if ($('.myClass') is not visible
[13:58:19] <ericelliott> $('.myClass').is(':visible');
[13:58:34] <ericelliott> might want to capture that return value and do something with it. ;)
[14:10:53] <toddWork> thanks ericelliott
[14:11:03] <toddWork> i just need to boolean
[14:11:06] <toddWork> *the
[14:11:20] <toddWork> so maybe .length.
[14:14:44] <danheberden> toddWork: is returns a boolean
[14:14:50] <danheberden> ?g is is not ajpiano
[14:14:51] <bot-t> danheberden, The opposite of jQuery's .is() method is not .not() - adam j. sontag - http://ajpiano.com/the-opposite-of-jquerys-is-method-is-not-not-it-is-is/
[14:16:30] <toddWork> ok. thanks
[14:16:51] <Eviltwin> Clearly we need .isnot(...)
[14:16:56] <danheberden> CLEARLY
[14:17:12] <danheberden> or .uhuh()
[14:17:37] <Eviltwin> I think .magic(...) that does whatever I wanted it to do in that context is what we really need
[14:18:47] <danheberden> .can( 'i have that one div and do stuff when it's clicked?', function...
[14:19:31] <danheberden> .can( 'you let me know when the window scrolls? KTHNX!', function...
[14:28:38] <Crazy4108> Hi! I'm trying to get my countdown function to work, it worked before i changed all the code to use each(function()) - It's just not updating? http://jsfiddle.net/xZAgW/1/
[14:33:10] <Eviltwin> Crazy4108: What's it supposed to do?
[14:33:45] <shoky> to not throw exceptions, for one
[14:34:27] <Eviltwin> Yeah, not have mismatched ()'s and {}'s
[14:34:40] <shoky> and other missing stuff.
[14:34:45] <shoky> like.. what's x and v
[14:35:12] <Eviltwin> Yeah, this is a total mess, dude
[14:38:10] <Eviltwin> Here's a massive step in the right direction: http://jsfiddle.net/xZAgW/2/
[14:39:16] <Crazy4108> Oh yes, sorry and thanks, for the help! Simple things, dont catch my eye!
[14:40:28] <shoky> Crazy4108: remember to check your console for errors
[14:40:40] <nsanden> is there a trick to getting .load() to pull in a webpage with javascript in it. for example i have a page with nothing but a google chart and getting strange results when i .load() it into my div
[14:41:33] <Crazy4108> shoky: console? I'm new to JS, im just looking at other things, and just going by my syntax of other languages
[14:41:43] <rmill> nsanden: you can't execute JS on a remote page from another page. unless we're talking about loading in an actual .js file.
[14:41:56] <rmill> Crazy4108: console.log()
[14:42:10] <nsanden> even if its remote page on same domain?
[14:42:28] <rmill> nsanden is it in <script> tags?
[14:42:35] <nsanden> yes

[14:43:26] <shoky> ;]
[14:43:35] <Crazy4108> Thanks for the help guys :£
[14:43:37] <Crazy4108> :3*
[14:43:39] <rmill> nsanden: you can't really do it that way. Or, atleast, I've never tried to.
[14:44:32] <rmill> nsanden: if it's inline, it won't like, just run on the HTML after calling .load()
[14:45:03] <nsanden> right... makes sense
[14:45:07] <nsanden> anyone have an idea how to do something like that? ultimately i want my google chart to be in a modal dialog when i click a link
[14:45:30] <rmill> you can call the google chart stuff after the .load()
[14:46:14] <rmill> or rather, on the complete callback
[14:47:21] <nsanden> hmm
[14:47:45] <rmill> .load( url, function() { // execute JS stuff here } );
[14:48:11] <nsanden> yeah its just the only reason for the .load in the first place is to call the google chart js
[14:48:31] <rmill> nsanden: can you provide an example/jsfiddle?
[14:50:48] <nsanden> http://www.bloggingawaydebt.com/test.php
[14:51:00] <nsanden> jsfiddle didnt work too well for this example
[14:52:43] <rmill> nsanden: I don't really get what you're trying to accomplish, there's no real reason to have two files
[14:52:48] <rmill> in this instance.
[14:53:11] <nsanden> well the chart is dynamic
[14:53:17] <rmill> nsanden: gimme a sec.
[14:53:44] <rmill> also, your php is showing.
[14:53:52] <rmill> <?php if(is_single()) { ?>
[14:53:54] <rmill> ;)
[14:53:56] <nsanden> yeah :)

[14:57:37] <Eviltwin> More or less

[15:11:44] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to put a watch on a cookie?
[15:20:04] <tw2113> with or without crumbling?
[15:20:44] <TrentonDAdams> dogarrhea2: Yeah, you can put a watch on a cookie.  Stick the cookie on the counter, take off your watch, and put it on the cookie.
[15:21:04] <dogarrhea2> it says the cookie is undefined
[15:21:15] <dogarrhea2> but under resources at a specific domain i see the cookie as being defined
[15:21:17] <wolfehr> when iterating through with each, is it possible to reverse the order to get the last element and work back the way?
[15:21:50] <hye> hi
[15:21:55] <TrentonDAdams> hi hye
[15:21:59] <wolfehr> get.reverse() found it
[15:22:00] <hye> :)
[15:22:05] <tw2113>  i wonder if there's a function to reverse the array before you do the $.each() wolfehr
[15:22:08] <aarjona> hello, I'm making a jquery plugin and I'm wondering what's the preferred method of inserting a bunch of html
[15:22:09] <tw2113> there ya go
[15:22:18] <aarjona> the plugin attaches to an empty div
[15:22:43] <aarjona> so far I'm just append()ing a string with the html
[15:22:56] <hye> if I have this element  <a href="#" class="one">test</a><div>abc</div>  let's say I select 'one' class $(".one")  how do i select the following div only, there could be multiple divs everywhere, and multiple <a>'s
[15:23:16] <tw2113> i've heard it's good for performance to concat a variable and the append the whole thing once aarjona
[15:23:40] <aarjona> I See
[15:24:05] <tw2113> that way you're not going through the dom each itteration
[15:25:38] <wolfehr> only found promise() earlier today, helped a lot with custom animations for remote data loading
[15:29:02] <aarjona> tw2113: I understand the template plugin will be jsrender, I'm wondering if it's the preferred solution for templating
[15:29:09] <aarjona> considering it's not yet "out"
[15:29:21] <tw2113> no idea regarding templating
[15:29:50] <aarjona> tw2113: I see, thanks

[15:42:07] <ryanneufeld> chrome
[15:42:16] <danheberden> LindsayMac: is the slide content, like, redownloading fonts?
[15:42:29] <LindsayMac> huh???
[15:42:40] <ryanneufeld> to be sure, i'm looking that the newsletter box, while clicking on the image slider up and to the left of it
[15:42:52] <danheberden> it doesn't look like they fade as much as they loose their weight or something
[15:43:21] <ryanneufeld> I'm not seeing any change at all
[15:43:34] <LindsayMac> yea im an idiot.. my FF window was just set to be small.. thats all
[15:43:36] <LindsayMac> its fine in FF
[15:43:46] <LindsayMac> but the blinking only seems to happen in chrome
[15:44:24] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  i was kinda thinking that too, but the font is set to normal... there are no lighter fonts used throughout
[15:44:32] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: what version of chrome?
[15:44:49] <LindsayMac> Version 21.0.1180.89
[15:44:51] <LindsayMac> most up to date
[15:44:55] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[15:44:56] <ryanneufeld> k
[15:44:58] <LindsayMac> and it happens on the input labels AND the submit button
[15:45:30] * ryanneufeld downloads chrome stable
[15:46:06] <LindsayMac> I was also thinking something to do with text shadows but that doesnt seem to be it either
[15:46:09] <LindsayMac> its VERY strange
[15:47:31] <danheberden> what's with this LindsayMac http://danheberden.com/share/e12e226.png
[15:47:36] <danheberden> maybe chrome is lagging on rendering or something
[15:47:40] <danheberden> because of all the css selectors
[15:47:50] <danheberden> repeated all over the place
[15:48:29] <LindsayMac> Woah that is strange@
[15:48:31] <LindsayMac> !!!
[15:48:38] <ryanneufeld> I'm on OSX Lion, with chrome 21 and 22 and I can't get it to act up
[15:49:08] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i am on osx too.. maybe you just arent noticing it?? its VERY feint change between them.. hardly noticable
[15:49:21] <ryanneufeld> I am getting old
[15:49:42] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  but even if that were teh case ( and I will try to find out why those are repeated) why would it re-render just that block of text when the slide moves?
[15:49:46] <LindsayMac> it doesnt make sense!
[15:49:54] <ryanneufeld> I'm really not able to reproduce it
[15:50:00] <ryanneufeld> strange
[15:50:03] <danheberden> no idea, just trying to throw ideas out :
[15:50:04] <danheberden> :/
[15:50:08] <danheberden> 'tis cray
[15:50:21] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  i understand.. just wanted to point it out.. not mad or anything ;)
[15:50:34] <danheberden> LindsayMac: oh, no, didn't mean to sound pouty :p
[15:50:43] <LindsayMac> haha ok... you never know
[15:50:51] <danheberden> I MEANT TO SOUND SERIOUSLY PISSED
[15:50:52] <danheberden> haha
[15:50:56] <LindsayMac> apparently i'm known to come off like an ass on IRC .. right tw2113 ?
[15:51:09] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: you and me both :P
[15:51:16] <danheberden> i've found always coming across like an ass helps that
[15:51:18] <tw2113> huh
[15:51:19] <danheberden> then there's no mystery
[15:51:38] <tw2113> i have my nights
[15:51:40] <tw2113> whenever sober
[15:51:53] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  see here: http://screencast.com/t/2DsyJVC26
[15:52:07] <LindsayMac> everytime the text blinks is when I am hitting the "next slide' button
[15:52:19] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I don't see that *at all*
[15:52:27] <ryanneufeld> I have seen a similar thing though
[15:52:27] <LindsayMac> well THAT Is strange....
[15:52:32] <danheberden> "blink" isn't the right description - the text doesn't dissapear
[15:52:35] <ryanneufeld> turned out to be a bug in chrome
[15:52:35] <danheberden> it looses weight
[15:52:38] <danheberden> which is funny
[15:52:40] <danheberden> because of the site
[15:52:42] <danheberden> you know...
[15:53:00] <ryanneufeld> I'm sure you've tried this, but have you cleared your cache, and restarted chrome?
[15:53:22] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yep.. this has been going on for some time across different computes i've noticed it
[15:53:28] <ryanneufeld> so odd
[15:53:36] <danheberden> "apparently text randomly looses weight ONLY on weight loss websites"
[15:54:04] <LindsayMac> HAHAHAHA danheberden
[15:54:11] <LindsayMac> its a testament to how AWESOME they are
[15:54:27] <danheberden> "even our form labels loose weight! THIS SHIT IS LEGIT SON"
[15:55:26] <LindsayMac> HAHAHA
[15:55:43] <LindsayMac> I guess if its a randomly occuring thing and it isnt happening everywhere, i wont worry too much about it
[15:56:10] <tw2113> if someone notices it, claim it's an easter egg
[15:56:15] <tw2113> and give them a can of free air
[15:56:28] <LindsayMac> hehe
[15:56:36] <tw2113> from Druidia
[16:02:32] <TelFiRE> Anyone know how to force flexslider to pause with a line of jquery? I can't add anything to the function to create a call back since it's in a module
[16:03:40] <danheberden> i did a line of jquery once... hooked ever since
[16:04:38] <tw2113> we're rehab now?
[16:06:00] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: It took me two lines, you must be flaky
[16:06:06] <TrentonDAdams> flakey
[16:06:43] <danheberden> like a box of wheaties
[16:07:14] <TrentonDAdams> Yeah, if you like wheaties, you're flakey. :D
[16:07:45] <TrentonDAdams> Seriously though, it took me two lines, so I'm thinking you must be one of those guys who adopt new technologies "just cause"
[16:07:46] <TrentonDAdams> :P
[16:08:11] <TrentonDAdams> Sorry, I hang my tongue out waaay too often. :P
[16:09:44] <danheberden> TrentonDAdams: well, jQuery was definitely a random choice
[16:09:46] <danheberden> it's ok i guess
[16:09:57] <danheberden> but i'm pretty new to it
[16:14:17] <tash> Hi guys, I'm using fnFooterCallback in DataTables.  I'm trying to get the SUM of all of the 'hours' which happens to be @ aData[10] in this pastie.  So, totalRemaining ends up being correct *if* there are 10 or less rows in my datatable.  But, since that isn't always the case it isn't adding the rest from page 2 in the datatable.  Does anyone know how to grab all of what I need considering I'm using pagination?  Sorry for the loaded question http://pastie.org/46
[16:14:55] <tash> I may not have provided enough data to get any help.  Not even sure anyone in here has used DataTables before.
[16:15:47] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: Yeah, it kind of was for me.  But, I do find it to be very useful, and fairly simple.  I did use ZK as well, which is pretty nice if you're into create a whole new Java UI
[16:16:24] <danheberden> Huh? Java != JavaScript
[16:16:44] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: I'm talking about using Java/JSP based systems.
[16:17:08] <TrentonDAdams> ZK is a framework that automates creationg of javascript, from a J2EE environment.
[16:17:52] <TrentonDAdams> ZK is cool, if you're building from the ground up, using J2EE.
[16:18:09] <TrentonDAdams> But, I like the simplicity of jQuery.
[16:20:01] <danzik17> yea, sometimes i do feel like javascript is missing out on the benefits of the AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean from java.
[16:22:45] <Tomasso> is there some way to get the event that is being launched by an object ?
[16:23:08] <danheberden> TrentonDAdams: but that's like saying i like pneumatic tools when working on a house, but really like using a jack-hammer to bust up concrete
[16:23:10] <Tomasso> triggered
[16:23:13] <danheberden> like - not a ton of correlation there
[16:23:35] <danheberden> but i digress
[16:23:37] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: I'm not sure what you're saying.
[16:23:39] <danheberden> jQueries for everybody
[16:23:59] <danheberden> you get a jQuery, YOU get a jQuery. EVERYBODY GETS A JQUERY!.
[16:24:28] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: If a person is using J2EE, it's perfectly sensible to use an AJAX framework that is designed right into the J2EE framework, and thereby automates everything.
[16:25:11] <danheberden> oh now i see what you're saying
[16:25:22] <danheberden> or at least i think i'm inferring it properly
[16:25:35] <TrentonDAdams> yeah, it basically makes the AJAX javascript stuff for you.
[16:25:41] <danheberden> as i touch java as much as my ex-wife (read: not very much)
[16:25:42] <TrentonDAdams> You don't have to write javascript at all
[16:25:47] <TrentonDAdams> Though you can if need be
[16:25:54] <danheberden> whew, cuz javascript is cray cray
[16:26:00] <danheberden> all those braces and dots 'n stuff
[16:26:11] <dojoi> anyone have any suggestions on jquery form validatoin plugins? im using the "Jquery Validation" plugin but it has an ounstanding bug that effects IE9 unfortuantely
[16:26:18] * danheberden is poking fun in general, not at you, in case i'm coming across as an ass :)
[16:26:29] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: not at all. :D
[16:26:42] <dojoi> https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/118
[16:26:52] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: Though, I'm not very easily offended.  Hmm, yeah, you looked like you were being an ass, now that I think about it.  JUST KIDDING
[16:27:14] <danheberden> dojoi: keep tweeting @jzaefferer until it's fixed? :D (note: don't actually do that)
[16:27:22] <dojoi> hhah
[16:27:47] <dojoi> not a bad idea had i had a twitter account
[16:28:11] <dojoi> cant seem to find another plugin that would let me consolidate errors in one spot
[16:28:21] <TrentonDAdams> dojoi: danheberden: You should automate those tweets, if they are going to be repeated regularly.
[16:28:26] <TrentonDAdams> :D
[16:28:30] <dojoi> and since this clown named his plugin so retardedly its almost impossible to cut out the noise
[16:28:48] <TrentonDAdams> dojoi: this works well, but I'm biased. :D https://github.com/TrentonAdams/perltwit
[16:29:06] <dojoi> ha
[16:30:52] <danheberden> dojoi: how dare he aptly name is plugin!
[16:31:18] <dojoi> hahh
[16:31:27] <dojoi> yeah its impossible to search for any other jquery vlaidation plugin
[16:31:41] <dojoi> like it keeps coming up in all my earches like its the defacto plugin
[16:31:49] <dojoi> just cant believe it with an IE9 glaring issue
[16:31:52] <danheberden> vladikoff: hear that? you're a jquery plugin
[16:32:04] <danheberden> vladation plugin
[16:32:12] <vladikoff> danheberden, finally!
[16:32:30] <aarjona> how expensive is find() in terms of performance?
[16:32:40] <aarjona> I'm wondering how liberally I can use it
[16:33:00] <qwebirc59477> Hi, people, i really have a bad problem. The .on() no detects click when the content is generated live. Something that would be catch with live()... how to do with .on()?? really really thanks.
[16:33:01] <aarjona> like I have a change event for a select and I do
[16:33:18] <danheberden> dojoi: since the open issues want a test case
[16:33:21] <danheberden> maybe you should make one to help out?
[16:33:24] <aarjona> var text = $(event.target).find("option:selected).text();
[16:33:43] <dojoi> yeah indeed i should
[16:33:48] <dojoi> do i require a github accnt to do so
[16:33:51] <danheberden> aarjona: unless you're doing it like a thousand times in a loop (and why on earth would you ever do that, right?!) then no expensive worries
[16:34:00] <aarjona> cool, thanks
[16:34:28] <danheberden> though in that case, you can just do event.target.options[ event.target.selectedIndex ]
[16:34:32] <danheberden> aarjona: ^
[16:34:51] <danheberden> or, rather, $( event.target.options[ event.target.selectedIndex ] ).text()
[16:34:58] <danheberden> if you were really worried about it
[16:35:05] <qwebirc59477> Someone can help me how to simulate the .live() with .on() ??? Thanks again.
[16:35:08] <aarjona> I see
[16:35:46] <danheberden> qwebirc59477: it's in the docs see ?on
[16:35:47] <bot-t> qwebirc59477, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:36:02] <danheberden> .on( 'whatevent', 'theSelectorOrWhatever', function...
[16:36:46] <danheberden> use it like delegate: $( '#someParentContainerOrDocumentOrSomething' ).on('click', '.thingy', fn )
[16:37:00] <qwebirc59477> danheberden i know that, but mi click isnt detect, because i use to catch something that is generate live on the DOM
[16:37:09] <BandC> how can I catch a form submit, do some things, then submit the form programmatically? I have an event handler on form submit; I do event.preventDefault(), stuff, then $(form).submit(). The problem is the event handler catches the submit again which results in an infinite loop. I really need something like event.continue() instead of form.submit(). Any ideas?
[16:37:21] <Eviltwin> $("selector").live("event", function() { ... }) becomes $(document).on("event", "selector", function() { ... }) in the literal translation
[16:37:43] <danheberden> qwebirc59477: then bind to an element that isn't made live, like document or a parent container
[16:37:48] <danheberden> as Eviltwin just made clearer
[16:38:08] <danheberden> and if you knew that, then you'd know that!
[16:38:23] <aarjona> danheberden: good to know, although it's not that many. Just gotta decide which would cause less confusion later on
[16:38:53] <danheberden> aarjona: yeah, totally - i think the options[selectedIndex] way is pretty common in the wild, so people would be used to seein git
[16:38:58] <qwebirc59477> Yes, thats true, the problem is that isnt work. I worked with jquery since 1,4 and this method no work now.. so rare... will investigate more. Really thanks guys!!
[16:39:16] <danheberden> and you could make it cleaner by var option = event.target.options[... and then $( option ).text();
[16:40:25] <Eviltwin> BandC: http://jsfiddle.net/GgWWW/
[16:41:09] <Eviltwin> $("#elem").submit(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...) gets passed in $("#elem").submit(function(event, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...) { ... });
[16:41:52] <BandC> hmm nice
[16:42:10] <BandC> is this a pretty standard way of dealing with this?
[16:42:14] <Eviltwin> Yes
[16:42:32] <BandC> do I really need the timeout? it looks like it could work with out it
[16:42:42] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, that was to illustrate that it could be async
[16:42:47] <Eviltwin> Yes, it absolutely works without
[16:46:08] <BandC> Eviltwin, thanks a lot!
[16:49:06] <Chuguniy> Hi guys! Can someone please give an example how to fire this code instantly http://pastebin.com/3itFed6L (.ready need to be changed to something else I guess). Thanks.
[16:50:14] <Eviltwin> Chuguniy: http://api.jquery.com/ready/ It really only makes sense for $(document).ready(...)
[16:50:22] <tw2113> $('#container').load('home.html'); ?
[16:51:24] <Chuguniy> tw2113: no, The thing is that it will load html file async, and I won't be able to use it :/
[16:52:08] <Chuguniy> I need to load it and then get a hight of the element which is filled with the home.html file
[16:52:40] <Eviltwin> Use the callback .load() provides
[16:53:08] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: Can you give an example please?
[16:53:17] <Eviltwin> .load('home.html', function() { /* do stuff that needs home.html here */ })
[16:53:56] <Chuguniy> Ah... will try it. Thank you!
[17:03:13] <Bish> meoow :3
[17:05:05] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: Working! Thanks!
[17:07:13] <bigLanky> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/dwight-d-opperman <--- i am using a jcarousel module and using circular wrap for this. there are only 5 items, but when it starts to cycle through instead of going from 5 back to 1, it just recreates 1 as #6
[17:07:28] <bigLanky> i need to either keep it from doing that, or somehow add a class to the middle item
[17:08:44] <Axsuul> Is it me or does jquery fade animations lag in safari?
[17:11:55] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: Not on a fast computer
[17:12:25] <Axsuul> Eviltwin: What is your reference?
[17:12:32] <Eviltwin> Safari on a fast computer
[17:12:45] <Axsuul> I mean which website/animation
[17:12:50] <Axsuul> are you using
[17:13:04] <Axsuul> I'm on a fast computer as well
[17:14:03] <danheberden> LindsayMac: i think the font thing might be a chrome issue, notice how techcrunch's menu bar changes weight as you scroll? http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/reportedly-development-to-cease-for-twitters-mac-client/
[17:14:18] <danheberden> like, depending what's on the page?
[17:15:12] <LindsayMac> I dont notice it on the techcrunch page
[17:16:10] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: http://jsfiddle.net/GykjJ/
[17:38:24] <coldhead> us women
[17:38:37] <LindsayMac> Woah-man
[17:38:56] <bigLanky> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/dwight-d-opperman <--- is it possible to somehow add an active class to the 3rd item in this case?
[17:39:18] <bigLanky> i have it set to wrap, but when it wraps it doesn't go from 5 back to 1, it goes from 5 to 6 to 7 etc...
[17:41:24] <bigLanky> o rknow of a similar slider that works the same way?
[17:42:25] <Chuguniy> Can't get the value from call back function http://pastebin.com/TRsbgd6t, what I'm doing wrong? console.log() says result is undefined.
[17:42:38] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[17:43:13] <Antaranian> having issues with Valums uploader
[17:43:50] <nsanden> Chuguniy, i dont believe that variable would be available outside the callback function would it? without making it global
[17:44:02] <Antaranian> it doesn't send any binary data, as I see in request via net panel
[17:44:10] <Antaranian> anyone experienced with it ?
[17:44:35] <Chuguniy> nsanden: so I need to put "var result" outside a function?
[17:45:12] <nsanden> inside the function
[17:45:25] <nsanden> but im not sure that would even be enough
[17:45:40] <nsanden> unless you do a synchronous .load
[17:45:46] <nsanden> but try it
[17:46:15] <Chuguniy> nope, doesn't work either
[17:46:29] <nsanden> you need to do synchronous then
[17:47:43] <Chuguniy> nsanden: how?
[17:49:28] <nsanden> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6849686/how-to-change-ajax-default-settings
[17:52:11] <Chuguniy> nsanden: This code http://pastebin.com/TRsbgd6t returns undefined. This one http://pastebin.com/8RHNcyBU displays the height as needed :/
[17:54:19] <nsanden> yep expected
[17:55:18] <nsanden> its either the variable isnt global
[17:55:25] <nsanden> only available in the function itself
[17:56:33] <nsanden> or in addition to that
[17:56:59] <nsanden> its that your console.log(result); is running before the ajax even loads
[17:57:27] <nsanden> so id try and fix the first problem cause its quick and easy
[17:57:32] <nsanden> just put var in front
[17:58:00] <nsanden> and if problem remains, then you must tell jquery to finish the ajax before it continues running additional code
[17:58:15] <nsanden> to do that, you do synchronous instead of asynchronous ajax
[17:59:35] <nsanden> theres the first fix http://pastebin.com/XpGzfj90
[17:59:58] <Chuguniy> nsanden: http://pastebin.com/pLEXeUej this works!
[18:00:37] <nsanden> yep there you go
[18:01:12] <Chuguniy> Thanks ;) been stuck on this quit a wile :)
[18:01:50] <nsanden> just fyi, synchronous isnt default for a reason
[18:02:56] <Chuguniy> nsanden: Why is that? And one more thing, if I turned async off in this function, will it be still active globaly?
[18:03:30] <nsanden> try turning it off and see
[18:03:43] <nsanden> dont think it will work
[18:04:03] <abjorn> coldhead mah qwerybro
[18:05:33] <Chuguniy> nsanden: hm... ok, will try a bit later, for now I'm just glad that this function works :)
[18:05:46] <Antaranian> ok, guys, any file upload plugin suggestions  ?
[18:05:53] <Eviltwin> Chuguniy: This has asynchronous AJAX: http://jsfiddle.net/g9dT5/
[18:06:02] <Eviltwin> Chuguniy: This has synchronous AJAX: http://jsfiddle.net/FStR5/
[18:06:09] <Eviltwin> Tell me which has a smoother animation
[18:06:29] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: ok, wait a sec...
[18:06:45] <Antaranian>  plugin which does only upload functionality, not jQuery UI progress bar and Twitter Bootstrat buttons hardcoded into source ?
[18:07:12] <Eviltwin> Chuguniy: Synchronous AJAX effectively locks up the browser while it's running
[18:08:41] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: well... async is much smoother, no doubt.
[18:09:28] <Switmac> hello..
[18:09:53] <Nathan2055> Can someone tell me why my code for dialog boxes at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nathan2055/afc_releasecandidate.js isn't working?
[18:10:05] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: What do you mean by locking the browser?
[18:10:54] <nsanden> Chuguniy: as in cant do anything really until that resource is loaded
[18:11:00] <nsanden> none of the rest of the page will load
[18:11:01] <deltaoo> is there a JQM tab solution or plugin?
[18:11:12] <nsanden> no more code will fire
[18:11:14] <Chuguniy> Ah...
[18:11:35] <Eviltwin> Chuguniy: Also the user won't be able to click things or scroll
[18:11:48] <Nathan2055> Hello?
[18:11:48] <Eviltwin> Or, in some cases, do any of the above on other tabs / browser windows
[18:12:01] <Eviltwin> So please don't use synchronous / async: false AJAX
[18:12:26] <lidocayne> Anyone here have a good site/tutorial for stylizing select boxes/dropdowns?  The default ones are fugly ....  Something similar to http://www.airbnb.com on the 1guest part of the bar...  I've been beating my head against the keyboard for days on this issue -figure there has to be some sort of a good jquery option for this (found plenty, but most are crap and poorly done)
[18:12:26] <nsanden> but sometimes no choice?
[18:13:52] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: Ok... so how do I write this http://pastebin.com/TRsbgd6t function  with async?
[18:14:01] <Nathan2055> Anybody?
[18:14:15] <Chuguniy> I can't get the value :/
[18:14:28] <Chuguniy> outside the callback function
[18:15:30] <Eviltwin> Chuguniy: http://pastebin.com/Kvbe3c2t
[18:16:29] <nsanden> ^ cool
[18:17:30] <Eviltwin> Nathan2055: For some reason it's not letting me see more than a few hundred pixels of content, it's just light gray after that
[18:17:43] <Nathan2055> Okay, I'll pastebin it.
[18:17:43] <Eviltwin> Can you put the relevant section in pastebin or pastie or something?
[18:17:51] <Nathan2055> ninja'd...
[18:18:00] <Eviltwin> And remind us of what your question is
[18:18:30] <grantg> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjfapkWZrDQ
[18:18:32] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: Well... It is just perfect!!! Thanks a bunch!!!
[18:19:31] <Nathan2055> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/3662271
[18:19:41] <deltaoo> so anyone with JQM Experience ?
[18:22:26] <Eviltwin> Nathan2055: So... what was the question? what is the relevant section?
[18:22:49] <Nathan2055> The beginning, why won't the dialogs work?
[18:23:10] <Eviltwin> Are you including jQuery and jQuery UI?
[18:23:32] <Eviltwin> Are you including a jQuery UI CSS theme?
[18:23:50] <Eviltwin> Does the dialog actually have the ID "dialog"?
[18:24:16] <Eviltwin> Is it actually in the DOM when the DOMContentLoaded event fires? (i.e. it's in the source of the page, not added after)
[18:28:32] <Nathan2055> brb
[18:33:56] <Chuguniy> Eviltwin: Sorry for bothering again. But how can I make it work like this http://pastebin.com/5Gr3bmcu ? I need the value to be available globaly!
[18:36:14] <min|dvir|us> Hi. How would I go about extending jQuery Color, which seems to only support animating CSS properties which only contain colors (like border-color but not border), to support text-shadow, which has no split properties?
[18:37:06] <deltaoo> the JQM guys seem very quiet any help on offer here for JQM ?
[18:37:19] <coldhead> worth a shot!
[18:37:38] <min|dvir|us> The relevant jQuery Color source: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/jquery.color.js
[18:37:54] <deltaoo> I'm looking for a tab solution (like the JQ one) but for JQM
[18:37:59] <min|dvir|us> (Which is apparently now a jQuery project?)
[18:43:45] <min|dvir|us> Anyone familiar with jQuery Color?
[18:45:41] <zelskeet> yes
[18:45:55] <min|dvir|us> zelskeet: responding to me?
[18:46:45] <coldhead> deltaoo: i have never seen a tab implementation for mobile
[18:47:05] <deltaoo> coldhead  : me neither - thats why I ask
[18:47:06] <coldhead> its all about those vertical accordions on mobile
[18:48:15] <deltaoo> coldhead : explain?
[18:48:41] <coldhead> deltaoo: have you seen the wikipedia mobile site?
[18:48:49] <deltaoo> no
[18:48:51] <coldhead> you just get the titles? and you tap to expand
[18:49:01] <min|dvir|us> deltaoo: IMO it's a better UI for mobile.
[18:49:02] <coldhead> that's the dominant mobile UI
[18:49:33] <coldhead> http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone
[18:50:48] <deltaoo> that would work if I could place them next to each otherand clide down:)
[18:51:16] <coldhead> so... it would work if they were a different thing altogether :D
[18:51:40] <coldhead> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/#docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[18:51:43] <coldhead> that looks vaguely tabby
[18:52:20] <coldhead> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html tabby
[18:53:52] <deltaoo> hmm
[19:05:39] <igcewieling> Can anyone explain the difference between .replaceWith() and .html()?
[19:07:13] <igcewieling> Is the only difference that replaceWith removes the element from the DOM first?
[19:10:01] <min|dvir|us> igcewieling: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L261-L293 v. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L219-L259
[19:11:16] <min|dvir|us> igcewieling: they're actually right next to each other.
[19:14:55] <min|dvir|us> How would I go about extending jQuery Color, which seems to only support animating CSS properties which only contain colors (like border-color but not border), to support text-shadow, which has no split properties?
[19:16:13] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: you're gonna wanna connect with gnarf on that, he's around a lot though
[19:18:27] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: thanks.
[19:18:41] <Nathan2055> Eviltwin: I'm back. I seem to have set the ID to ".dialog". I'll fix it...
[19:18:52] <optraz> i have a jquery code where when a drop down is detected, it will post the data back to the server, now how do i reload the page or part of the page itself to reflect the changes done?
[19:20:08] <Nathan2055> Eviltwin: You still here?
[19:38:42] <itatitat> guys Im frustrated, why this event never is fired?, is scrollTop, this code: https://gist.github.com/3662662
[19:39:22] <min|dvir|us> itatitat: scrollTop is not an event.
[19:39:36] <itatitat> ouch..........is a property?.........
[19:39:37] <min|dvir|us> itatitat: http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[19:40:31] <optraz> when i submit a http post to the server, how do i tell the browser to relaod/refresh to load new page?
[19:40:54] <min|dvir|us> optraz: RIGHT when you POST, or when the POST completes?
[19:41:45] <optraz> after the post complete
[19:41:51] <optraz> min|dvir|us: ^^
[19:42:06] <min|dvir|us> optraz: how are you making the request?
[19:42:20] <min|dvir|us> optraz: use Gist/JSfiddle.
[19:42:57] <optraz> min|dvir|us: jquery.
[19:43:29] <min|dvir|us> optraz: give it a `function () { window.location = 'google.com'; }`.
[19:43:50] <optraz> min|dvir|us: what you mean give it a function ?
[19:44:52] <min|dvir|us> optraz: it's time to get familiar with first-class functions.
[19:44:55] <min|dvir|us> (Google that.)
[19:45:27] <optraz> http://www.jquery4u.com/jquery-functions/jquery-select-items-specific-class/
[19:45:50] <optraz> that is the first link appear by googling "jquery first-class functions"
[19:46:12] <min|dvir|us> No, just first-class functions.
[19:46:18] <min|dvir|us> It's a general programming term.
[19:46:33] <min|dvir|us> The short of it is that functions are objects just like numbers or strings.
[19:46:35] <coldhead> EVERY DAY, WALKING ROUND, IN THE STREETS OF YOUR TOWN
[19:47:06] <min|dvir|us> One operation you can perform to a number is to add to it. num + 2. One operation you can perform to a function is to call it. func().
[19:47:08] <optraz> In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. Specifically, this means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.
[19:47:35] <optraz> min|dvir|us: fine.. what does it have to do with what i ask?
[19:47:45] <min|dvir|us> optraz: like I said, pass a function.
[19:48:11] <optraz> you mean call the function after the http post is complete?
[19:48:22] <min|dvir|us> optraz: no, I mean pass the function as an argument.
[19:48:33] <min|dvir|us> This function will be called with the XHR completes.
[19:48:47] <min|dvir|us> *when
[19:48:56] <optraz> i see
[19:49:25] <min|dvir|us> $.ajax follows the promises protocol, so that can be very useful depending on what you're doing.
[19:49:55] <optraz> min|dvir|us: actually my original goal is that, i have three drop down select form.. now when user change the first drop down, i want the table below refresh with new data.. so i dont know if i need jquery post or jquery ajax?
[19:50:48] <min|dvir|us> optraz: $.ajax is a general interface. $.post implements $.ajax but gives it a nice interface.
[19:51:08] <min|dvir|us> It doesn't matter which you use, but your end goal isn't changing the address of the page.
[19:51:27] <min|dvir|us> Your end goal is DOM manipulation, which jQuery will do.
[19:52:58] <optraz> min|dvir|us: fine.. any example/tutorial in the web ? i tried google.. no close result maybe the keyword i use is wrong
[19:54:09] <min|dvir|us> optraz: first things first, which is getting data from the server.
[19:54:38] <min|dvir|us> optraz: have you attempted to pass a function yet?
[19:55:11] <optraz> nope.
[19:56:58] <pandu101> Hi all. I want my code to ignore certain keypresses by the user (eg up arrow, down arrow, etc). Right now, Im doing a long-winded "if (e.keyCode == 9 || e.keyCode == 17....)" Is there a shorter way to do this?
[19:58:37] <pandu101> Like can I create an array of keycodes and then use if (keycode in ignorekeyarr) {..}?
[19:59:38] <min|dvir|us> pandu101: keycodes are a great use case for a switch block.
[19:59:49] <optraz> min|dvir|us: i try later...
[19:59:52] <optraz> tahnks for your help
[20:00:08] <min|dvir|us> optraz: that's the spirit.
[20:01:02] <pandu101> min|dvirs|us: ok thanks.
[20:01:33] <min|dvir|us> pandu101: type 'min' and press tab.
[20:02:08] <pandu101> Oh Cool! Great tip! Thanks :)

[20:59:33] <ibodi> sometimes i do not like people to see html source code, is it a good idea to use jquery to load html .
[20:59:47] <ibodi> if in this method, who actually still sees the html sourcecode ?
[21:01:39] <WebDragon> â—â— â— shady practices
[21:01:53] <WebDragon> but you can still see the html when you Inspect Element in Opera, Chrome, Firebug
[21:02:17] <ibodi> ok. let me test ...
[21:02:26] <WebDragon> easy to test
[21:02:47] <WebDragon> I have an image slider that adds little boxes via jquery to the bottom that shows which image in the list you're at
[21:02:59] <WebDragon> and those all show up in the element inspector
[21:03:19] <WebDragon> ey shoe
[21:14:51] <ibodi> WebDragon: u r right. actually it is visible in Element inspect
[21:15:11] <ibodi> WebDragon: will it be visible by bot?
[21:15:38] <WebDragon> depends on how sophisticated one makes ones bot
[21:16:29] <ibodi> eg google-bot. sometimes i would like human being to view, but not the search bot.
[21:18:55] <WebDragon> still somewhat shady and not guaranteed
[21:20:41] <ibodi> WebDragon: ok. that's good. as the content is nothing privacy.
[21:22:38] <ibodi> actually, instead of traditional html load, now i m using jquery to load html later, any man-in-middle to grab the contents as easily as the old ways ?
[21:25:13] <ibodi> or they are actually same.
[21:25:48] <ibodi> or jQuery method is better, as man-in-middle can not read content in correct order?
[21:39:46] <thebigkiwi> ok, who wants a simple job to help me some animate some areas in and out of a site and fix up a couple of little issues?
[22:29:53] <Gambit-> hoy chaps
[22:30:02] <Gambit-> any good visual designer tools?
[22:30:13] <Gambit-> something to speed form layout and such, for example?/
[22:39:43] <Gambit-> any good visual designer tools for forms and such?
[22:49:48] <versatiletech> Gambit-: wufoo.com It should let you build the form and then use the html/css
[22:50:02] <Gambit-> thx
[22:50:05] <Gambit-> I'll give it a try
[22:50:32] <Gambit-> Tho that looks more like wufoo hosted stuf.f
[22:50:47] <Gambit-> or do you just mean, design the form and then pillage the html afterwards?
[23:07:43] <azbyin> hi all
[23:08:08] <azbyin> what is a better equivalent to $("#area option:not(:last):not(:first)") ?
[23:08:28] <azbyin> i.e. select all the option tags within #area except the first and last one
[23:12:15] <nprasath002> Hi if i .append() to add some html element will it obey the css rules? or do i have add inline css?
[23:33:07] <coldhead> nprasath002: it will obey the appropriate CSS
[23:33:08] <coldhead> ?tias
[23:33:08] <bot-t> Try It And See
[23:48:27] <azbyin> what is the best way to grab unique text within matching tags?
[23:49:32] <azbyin> e.g:  <pa><ch>A</ch></pa><pa><ch>B</ch></pa><pa><ch>B</ch></pa>
[23:50:03] <azbyin> i want to grab A, B from this
