[00:00:12] <Ankabout> can anyone help me with scrolling some div's within another on clicking?
[00:01:54] <neoesque> Hi all,I have a problem with IE7/8 event handling. I bind a click function (A-function) that called another click function (B-function). Both A and B bind on different checkbox elements. B-function will check B-checkbox is checked or not. On IE 7/8, it seems run B-funtion callback first, and then click the element. that make checking B-checkbox is checked or not broken.
[00:02:57] <neoesque> On the other browser, it checked first and then run callback function. It's fine on the other browser(includes IE9).
[00:03:30] <ruby_on_tails> if i have 100 TRs selected, how can I split them into 20 chunks of 5 each ?
[00:22:49] <Ankabout> can anyone help me with scrolling some div's within another on clicking?
[00:23:45] <SIDU> <tr><td>checkbox</td>.....<td><input> when input changed, howto set the first checkbox as checked?
[00:23:54] <SIDU> sorry i asked before and forgot the answer.
[00:24:30] <SIDU> $(this).prevAll("checkbox").attr("checked","checked") ?
[00:27:55] <debby90> hey guys, I have a group of nested <DL>s. When i click on an element that is containted with the <dd> element, i need to trace my way back to my container element and retrieve the <dt> elements on the way..
[00:28:21] <debby90> I tried parentsUntill(container).map() but it's not working 100%
[00:28:24] <debby90> any ideas?
[00:30:10] <SIDU> i made this working however too long: $(this).parents("tr").children().children().attr('checked','checked');
[00:31:45] <ServerSage> Is there a way to select only a portion of the text in an input box?  For example, lets say I have an input text box with "foo bar monkey gonad" in it, and I want to highlight/select just the word monkey.
[00:32:10] <intellilogic> I have some code in doc.ready, but then I make some ajax calls and that code doesn't work on the new content, suggestions?
[00:33:23] <ServerSage> intellilogic: Take a look at the javascript console in your browser, might lend you some clues.
[00:34:12] <debby90> intellilogic: can you be more specific? are you adding elements after your ajax calls?
[00:37:03] <SIDU> coldhead: hi ~
[00:37:08] <SIDU> $('#dataTable *').change(function(){$(this).parents("tr").children().eq(0).children().attr('checked','checked')});
[00:37:15] <SIDU> howto update above ?
[00:38:08] <SIDU> it is working though
[00:38:27] <SIDU> tr>td>input ..td|td| ...
[00:38:41] <debby90> intellilogic: well, my best guess is that you need to use .live()
[00:41:47] <coldhead> SIDU: maybe $(this).closest("tr").find('td:first *').attr(etc ?
[00:43:51] <SIDU> coldhead: ok does not look much different. ok no worries about it. it is working anyway.
[00:44:19] <stede> hi. how to refresh an (ajax) tab (ui-tabs) which is already selected? and how to manipulate it's ajax request?
[00:44:25] <SIDU> coldhead: however jq seem not able to apply rules to html in js bit
[00:44:51] <coldhead> i don't know what you mean, SIDU
[00:45:51] <SIDU> coldhead: i have $(doc).ready(fn)... these fn does not affect "hmtl" in js code
[00:47:03] <SIDU> coldhead: i have fn: addHTMLrow(){...html...} this html does  triggled by the document ready functions.
[00:47:26] <coldhead> .ready() only fires once, when the document finishes loading
[00:47:40] <coldhead> so i think what you're describing is how it's meant to work
[00:48:40] <imanc> what is the best build tool for compressing javascript into a single file?
[00:48:56] <SIDU> coldhead: fn addRow("<div id='aa'>...") <== $('#aa').click(..) not working
[00:49:34] <SIDU> coldhead: so i guess i have to manually work old ways: add" onclick='...'
[00:54:47] <Xotix> hi
[00:58:02] <coldhead> SIDU: NOOOOO! if you want to add a click handler to elements that aren't on the page yet just use live!
[00:58:06] <coldhead> ?live @ SIDU
[00:58:07] <bot-t> SIDU, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[00:58:38] <coldhead> $('.aaa').live('click', function () {alert('lol');})
[00:59:50] <SIDU> ah.. i guess some guys mentioned earlier, so he might talk to me :)
[00:59:57] <SIDU> thanks
[01:00:02] <coldhead> no problem!
[01:01:21] <Xotix> i need some basic reading about how stuff like .click gets applied to html. e.g. here http://pastebin.com/F5sSLCFM the if gets called just once at the beginning and all the click's logic gets added to the element. also state gets false but since it doesnt check again, it never goes into the else. right? Give me something to read about such stuff.pls :)
[01:06:27] <SIDU> coldhead: well. i created a bug :(
[01:06:38] <SIDU> coldhead: original code is ==
[01:06:50] <SIDU> $('#dataTable *').change(function(){$(this).parents("tr").children().eq(0).children().attr('checked','checked')});
[01:06:55] <SIDU> and i changed to :
[01:07:06] <SIDU> $('#dataTable *').live('change',function(){$(this).parents("tr").children().eq(0).children().attr('checked','checked')});
[01:07:29] <SIDU> coldhead: now onchange, will popup an alert, then the checbox also works
[01:09:09] <SIDU> coldhead: easy down :D
[01:09:15] <SIDU> me problem . bug fixed :)
[01:09:37] <Ankabout> how do I slide an element up or down according to named anchors within?
[01:11:03] <NoNoNo> Ankabout: $('SOMEELEMENT:has(A[name="whatever"])').slideToggle();
[01:12:59] <SIDU> coldhead: will live() slow down performance ?
[01:17:37] <SIDU> well. howto make this in live()?
[01:17:39] <SIDU> $('.pop').prepend("<b class='xpop' title='Close'></b>")
[01:17:59] <inad922> hello
[01:19:29] <inad922> I try to make an ajax call to the server insert the answer with .html() and .slideDown() the containing element which previously had 'style="display: none; "' but instead of sliding down the element just pops in. Anyone knows why this might happen?
[01:19:49] <coldhead> SIDU: live() shouldn't affect performance unless you have a lot of live()s and or a very heavy page
[01:19:54] <coldhead> in which case you can use delegate()
[01:20:04] <coldhead> ?delegate
[01:20:04] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:20:14] <coldhead> but live() is generally fine
[01:20:22] <coldhead> don't worry about it until you notice it running slowly
[01:20:26] <SIDU> coldhead: ok
[01:20:59] <SIDU> coldhead: howto live() this: $('.pop').prepend("html");
[01:21:38] <SIDU> coldhead: there is no event though
[01:21:54] <COLHAX> what are you talking about?
[01:22:23] <SIDU> coldhead: however it does not matter much, i and manually insert
[01:23:47] <SIDU> coldhead: the resizeable i m not using jq ui, which is about 200K, i m still using x-broswers js, which is 10k
[01:25:17] <coldhead> i don't understand what you mean, SIDU
[01:25:33] <coldhead> if you have .live('click') it will work for elements in that html when you prepend them
[01:25:40] <coldhead> if they match the selector
[01:26:01] <SIDU> coldhead: this guy is also as smart as jq: www.cross-browser.com/x/examples/drag3.php
[01:26:01] <coldhead> $('.something-in-your-appended-html').live('click', ...)
[01:26:43] <SIDU> someguy too smart that does not look like a real human :D
[01:28:35] <aaronmcadam> delegaaaaaaaaaaate
[01:29:21] <coldhead> live() is the solution for when you don't have the energy to explain delegate
[01:29:26] * coldhead welcomes aaronmcadam
[01:30:06] <aaronmcadam> hha
[01:30:07] <SIDU> coldhead: deal
[01:30:25] <aaronmcadam> live probably won't be deprecated at this stage but it should be
[01:31:03] <coldhead> it will always live on in my heart
[01:31:05] <coldhead> LIVE on
[01:31:06] <aaronmcadam> I remember a podcast where the devs were cringing at the live/die method naming
[01:31:08] <coldhead> SEE WHAT I DID THERE
[01:31:09] <coldhead> ahahahah
[01:31:14] <aaronmcadam> jesus man
[01:31:19] <coldhead> hey scotty

[01:31:26] <aaronmcadam> :p
[01:36:15] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, and would that move the element to the top of the parent element or?
[01:36:24] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, sorry for the long delay, was in a phone call

[01:38:35] <pTa_armi> hi all. Somebody here who can help me with an jquery ui problem? We are using draggable and droppables. The problem is, that we have a slideDown within the page which causes wrong behavior if we drop the draggable. The drop zone seems to be like before the slidedown

[01:39:06] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:39:16] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, mind helping me put this together in a jFiddle? I have the basis set up, but no jQuery yet

[01:40:54] <jquery-boy> Anyone knows how a simple animation is not working in jquerymobile, like $('#dtgame').show("slide", { direction: "right" }, 600);   ??
[01:43:17] <jquery-boy> is jquerymobile able to animate a div or do I need to include query-ui also??
[01:44:24] <DarsVaeda> how do I continue in a $.each?
[01:44:37] <coldhead> jquery-boy: i'd expect animate should work. try it from the firebug or chrome inspector console?
[01:44:56] <coldhead> unfortunately the people i lean on for mobile help are asleep
[01:45:16] <coldhead> DarsVaeda: from memory it's return true; and failing that check the docs :P

[02:13:40] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:13:53] <coldhead> crikey
[02:13:56] <aaronmcadam> well in compass' docs, the view source sometimes shows +
[02:14:12] <aaronmcadam> no worries, it's not like a huge thing to type a few extra chars
[02:14:26] <Ankabout> oh hey NoNoNo. thanks for your tip with the sliding, but I can't seem to get it to work... mind giving me a hand with jFiddle?
[02:14:32] <aaronmcadam> anyway best to keep it with the @ directives until my team learn sass too
[02:14:41] <aaronmcadam> was just wondering

[02:16:15] <aaronmcadam> jquery included?
[02:16:53] <Xotix> yeah :) just wanted to change something
[02:17:21] <Xotix> it's 1.3.2
[02:20:18] <johnline3> hey babbies
[02:20:28] <johnline3> is there a way to fadeIn an addclass?
[02:20:55] <Xotix> seems like 1.3 rly doesn't have this function included...

[02:21:50] <johnline3> i wanna fadeIn a border on an element
[02:22:00] <ravenzz> hide().addClass('foo').fadeIn();
[02:22:01] <ravenzz> ?
[02:22:15] <ravenzz> uhm
[02:23:03] <johnline3> its a lot to ask, my initial idea is to fadeIn a div over the top of the element, with the pretti border
[02:23:12] <johnline3> no luck so far
[02:23:16] <Ankabout> what's wrong with my jQuery here? http://jsfiddle.net/FqMTY/5/

[02:26:39] * Ankabout rolls drums
[02:26:39] <aaronmcadam> bet it's shit ;)

[02:28:27] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/kpdS3/ why the readmore Link values doesn't change?
[02:29:57] <Ankabout> Kambfhase... is it supposed to work when I click?
[02:30:05] <Kambfhase> no
[02:30:11] <Ankabout> lol
[02:30:37] <projmon> hey guys, im using a jquery plugin called dragscroll. it works fine with 1.4.2 but it seems to break with 1.6.1. any idea what changed that may break it?
[02:30:58] <Kambfhase> I was merely cleaning up ypur code.
[02:31:01] <aaronmcadam> Kambfhase: didn't u mean to create a closure there?
[02:31:09] <Ankabout> haha thanks Kambfhase
[02:31:19] <aaronmcadam> to pass jQuery as $?
[02:31:22] <Kambfhase> working on it now ;)
[02:31:29] <aaronmcadam> or to $ i mean
[02:32:15] <aaronmcadam> also I think explicit $( document ).ready() calls are easier to read for team working
[02:33:30] <aaronmcadam> projmon: get an unminifed version of 1.6.2 and then paste in the errors you get in firebug
[02:33:43] <imanc> aaronmcadam: get to work
[02:34:03] <Kambfhase> ravenzz: why declaring .toggle inside the click?
[02:34:25] <aaronmcadam> imanc is that you, wind it in ye big bollocks :p
[02:34:35] <imanc> haha
[02:35:05] <imanc> aaronmcadam: yeh, i was asking about build scripts to concat & minify js

[02:37:59] <aaronmcadam> imanc: course
[02:38:12] <imanc> it's cool - going to use it on this project
[02:38:15] <aaronmcadam> don't use it tho, no real need at the mo
[02:38:55] <aaronmcadam> imanc: started using sass and compass yesterday, refactored the css from the mob project, much better already
[02:40:14] <imanc> aaronmcadam: very nice.  Seems like a minor hinderance having to build the css on each step though
[02:40:20] <aaronmcadam> nope

[02:42:29] <aaronmcadam> cool I'll show you this stuff then
[02:42:38] <imanc> nice
[02:42:49] <aaronmcadam> i need to get a build script sorted myself
[02:43:11] <aaronmcadam> I'm just gonna bastardise the hbp build
[02:43:32] <imanc> yeh - same here. Also need to get the css sorted out. Is your sass stuff compiling css into one script?
[02:43:39] <aaronmcadam> yep
[02:43:53] <imanc> ahh
[02:43:54] <aaronmcadam> you can use partials and stuff and then it can minify them all together
[02:44:13] <aaronmcadam> but by default, it prints out the source file line for debugging, handy
[02:44:18] <johnline3> thanks ravenzz, i revised my methods
[02:44:24] <imanc> how much learning curve do you reckon there is in sass?  can a front-end dev pick it up on the fly?
[02:44:29] <aaronmcadam> it's very easy
[02:44:50] <aaronmcadam> the only thing is figuring out which parts of your stylesheet should be reusable
[02:45:20] <aaronmcadam> it's up on the repo if you want a look
[02:47:17] <ravenzz> Kambfhase because the its text value must change on click...
[02:47:36] <ravenzz> from "Read more" to "Less"
[02:47:39] <ravenzz> and viceversa
[02:47:53] <ravenzz> he quits
[02:47:54] <ravenzz> lol
[02:47:57] <aaronmcadam> ha
[02:48:07] <aaronmcadam> simples
[02:48:45] <ravenzz> -its
[02:54:59] <theCode> how do you prevent adraggable parent from hijacking its child's drag event?
[02:55:32] <johnline3> what is the reverse of .append() ?
[02:55:39] <DanV> Hi everyone. I have a fadein/fadeout action on a Loding dialog for some filters with ajaxStart/ajaxComplete . http://jsfiddle.net/UuLuL/  . But the page ajax request often loads faster then the loading screen, and if you click on multiple filters and play around, you will end up with Loading fadein/fadeout queue and it will still show up even if it's really done. any way i can fix that?
[02:55:40] <theCode> prepend()
[02:55:45] <DarsVaeda> theCode: : there is an option for it "greedy" I think
[02:55:50] <theCode> ok
[02:56:04] <theCode> let me see
[02:56:15] <johnline3> thanks theCode
[02:58:25] <TrueColors> Okay, lets say... var width contains the width of an parent element.
[02:58:37] <TrueColors> and var strength can contain any number. lets say between 0 and 5
[02:58:43] <TrueColors> where 5 is width 100% 0 is ... 0%
[02:59:06] <TrueColors> I basically wnat to calculate the width percentage based on ... strength
[02:59:40] <TrueColors> for example, if var strength was between 0 and 100, it's simply width: strength + "%"
[03:00:04] <TrueColors> but if strength was betweeen 0 and 5
[03:00:17] <TrueColors> technically I'd have to do ... oh wait nevermind
[03:00:18] <TrueColors> it can't be dynamic.
[03:00:33] <TrueColors> i can just do (strength * 20) + "%"
[03:01:16] <TrueColors> oh wait i explained it wrong.
[03:02:51] <TrueColors> okay ignore me, i got it right
[03:04:07] <gnarf> Ankabout: did you ever figure out your slide problem? coldhead ping me about it, wanna rephrase? :)
[03:05:31] <Segaja> hi, i have found a bug in datepicker of jqueryui
[03:05:56] <Segaja> http://segaja.de/stuff/mario/ in month november 2011 there is one calendar week too much at the bottom.
[03:06:13] <Segaja> this happens because of the month october
[03:06:50] <Foxandxss> stupid question, If I have a list of items and with mouse over one I need to fadeout one, that will work?: $(".items").click(function() { $(this).fadeOut("slow") });
[03:07:59] <Segaja> Foxandxss: it works on click not on mouse over
[03:09:45] <Foxandxss> meh, true
[03:09:48] <Foxandxss> just the idea
[03:10:49] <Foxandxss> just linking some jquery code to a template, bla bla bla and doesn't work, Im asking but I needed to confirm that my jquery code is ok
[03:10:51] <Foxandxss> just thanks :P
[03:15:06] <mattems> hey all
[03:15:37] <DarsVaeda> on an input type hidden field, how do I not select one that is disabled $(":input:not(:disabled)") seems to be not the right thing to do
[03:16:40] <mattems> when running php bin/vendors install we get the following problems. http://pastebin.com/aRmri7nb see last 3 lines. any ideas?
[03:17:32] <mattems> sorry
[03:17:33] <mattems> wrong channel
[03:17:36] <mattems> ignore that
[03:18:04] <Ankabout> gnarf, no I didn't :(
[03:22:40] <rethus> i use ui-theme. But on Internet-explorer my fieldset have many space above... http://gyazo.com/b19b72e6e134ba63218813c44cfc35f5
[03:22:48] <rethus> any idea, if this a regular IE bug?
[03:23:47] <Ankabout> gnarf, did you need more info, or was that for cold.head ?
[03:24:23] <gnarf> Ankabout: Can you repeat the problem for me?
[03:24:33] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/FqMTY/6/
[03:24:50] <Ankabout> basically I want to move to the next gray block (next named anchor) on clicking the one visible now
[03:25:27] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: you ever had output_style in config not work?
[03:29:30] <Ankabout> gnarf, does it make sense?
[03:29:44] <gnarf> not really
[03:30:08] <Ankabout> well I have 3 divs (the gray blocks) and they are children of the red block
[03:30:16] <Ankabout> I want to move them up one by one on clicking
[03:30:37] <Ankabout> only one is visible at a time because the red box is smaller
[03:37:12] <Ankabout> gnarf, I was thinking of using jcarousel for this, but can't get that to work either
[03:44:07] <Ankabout> gnarf, was afraid I had a difficult question :)
[03:44:53] <keir> how do i put  >  in text?
[03:44:58] <keir> in html :P
[03:45:36] <Zelest> Is it possible to select an element which starts with something? like $('div.foo*') ?
[03:46:05] <keir> anyone?
[03:46:21] <Pjotor> &gt;
[03:46:22] <twoface> keir, find the html entity for it
[03:46:36] <iszak> Zelest, $('div[class^=foo]') but that will possibly b0rk for multiple classes.
[03:46:59] <keir> i was wondering if anyone could tell me the html entity for it but i'll keep looking on the web :P
[03:47:00] <iszak> Zelest, you may need to use a custom filter function.
[03:47:05] <Zelest> ah
[03:47:06] <keir> oh thanks pjotor
[03:47:09] <Zelest> cheers
[03:58:53] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: We use different output-styles without problems
[03:59:30] <aaronmcadam> ok cheers man
[04:04:39] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: what kind of problem do you have with it?
[04:06:57] <TeddyMurray> $('.select_item_dropdown :last')
[04:07:06] <TeddyMurray> showing blank in console window, but it does exist
[04:07:08] <Ankabout> anyone know how I can make a jcarousel-like scrolling of some nested elements? http://jsfiddle.net/FqMTY/6/
[04:07:11] <TeddyMurray> several exist actually
[04:07:21] <TeddyMurray> can you not use :last selector on a classname?
[04:09:17] <TeddyMurray> D:!!
[04:10:37] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: it's just ignoring the directive
[04:13:24] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: ah it *is* working! pycharm just isn't showing the new file properly :)
[04:13:54] <aaronmcadam> thanks for trying to help NoNoNo :)
[04:14:22] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, any chance you can help me a bit further with my sliding issue?
[04:15:03] <NoNoNo> Ankabout: Please repeat your question
[04:15:37] <aaronmcadam> Ankabout.repeat( 'question', 'now' );
[04:15:45] <Ankabout> well I have 3 nested divs in a container, and I want to let them slide up one by one on clicking. the nested div's have named anchors. http://jsfiddle.net/FqMTY/6/
[04:16:02] <Ankabout> lol aaronmcadam
[04:16:16] <aaronmcadam> Ankabout: you know the name attr of a is deprecated?
[04:16:19] <aaronmcadam> or are you using ids?
[04:16:35] <aaronmcadam> ids do the same thing
[04:16:42] <Ankabout> the code in there was taken from advice NoNoNo gave me earlier
[04:16:50] <Ankabout> but I'm obviously not implementing it right
[04:16:53] <aaronmcadam> i haven't looked at your fiddle
[04:16:59] <aaronmcadam> just saying :)
[04:17:02] <TeddyMurray> can you use the :last on a .class_name ?
[04:17:08] <aaronmcadam> sure
[04:17:10] <TeddyMurray> such as .classname :last
[04:17:17] <aaronmcadam> use .last()
[04:17:17] <TeddyMurray> hmm
[04:17:42] <aaronmcadam> $( '.classyStuffs').last() will return the last .classyStuffs element
[04:17:44] <TeddyMurray> thanks
[04:18:06] <aaronmcadam> no probssss
[04:19:37] <aaronmcadam> fuck me sass is awesome
[04:20:06] <blainsd> what's sass ?
[04:20:10] <aaronmcadam> OMG
[04:20:14] <aaronmcadam> srslyyyy?
[04:20:36] <aaronmcadam> blainsd: http://thesassway.com/
[04:20:51] <aaronmcadam> I want to use sass to generate my jqueries NoNoNo ;)
[04:22:16] <Guest59116> would anyone agree that http://danielprotopopov.com/ahqds/Components.html?Type=Armor conforms to pure client side website example?
[04:22:25] <blainsd> o synthetically awesome stylesheets...
[04:22:41] <blainsd> do you use it ?
[04:24:14] <aaronmcadam> yep
[04:24:31] <aaronmcadam> never want to write vanilla css again
[04:27:27] <NoNoNo> Ankabout: Your demo does work; the result is just clipped. Remove the overflow:hidden on .container and see the slideToggle
[04:28:00] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: what platform do u develop on?
[04:28:01] <chachan> guys, I searching for a library/plugin which allow me create images from a jQuery selector. Any suggestion?
[04:28:12] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: SASS requires some discipline to not overdo it
[04:28:22] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: I was joking dude lol
[04:28:26] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: FF + Firebug
[04:28:59] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: I meant OS. I'm thinking I can hook into Compass' inotify to show notifcations on linux mint/ubuntu
[04:29:08] <dr0id> ubuntu is great
[04:29:16] <aaronmcadam> I prefer mint now
[04:29:21] <aaronmcadam> much better driver support
[04:29:34] <aaronmcadam> and 32-bit PAE is really fast n stable
[04:29:34] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: I develop on an iMac
[04:29:44] <aaronmcadam> cool well you could use growl then
[04:29:48] <IgnisDiabolus> wait, OS isn't off-topic?
[04:30:00] <aaronmcadam> nevermind about OT :P
[04:30:08] <IgnisDiabolus> :P
[04:30:08] <aaronmcadam> platforms are important too :)
[04:30:12] <IgnisDiabolus> ok, Arch Linux!
[04:30:17] <twoface> +1 for arch
[04:30:18] <aaronmcadam> was waiting for that
[04:30:22] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: yep; I programm with Textmate, there you can overload the CMD-S (save file) shortcut e.g. with a Compile Sass command
[04:30:23] <IgnisDiabolus> heh
[04:30:28] <IgnisDiabolus> Elementary OS?
[04:30:32] <aaronmcadam> any of u guys know about inotify then?
[04:30:48] <dr0id> Windows 8
[04:30:51] <xp_prg> anyone have any recommendations on the best way to do an image gallery in drupal?
[04:31:00] <dr0id> Drupal is y0
[04:31:00] <aaronmcadam> NoNoNo: I'm just using compass watch, it detects file changes and pycharm saves as you type
[04:31:01] <NoNoNo> Windows 9 will be really good!
[04:31:03] <IgnisDiabolus> hey, have you heard of apple's new product? twas released earlier this week
[04:31:16] <NoNoNo> which one?
[04:31:17] <zeppo> the ipod?
[04:31:22] <IgnisDiabolus> no, the iQuit
[04:31:24] <aaronmcadam> iWank?
[04:31:33] <dr0id> !kickban IgnisDiabolus
[04:31:37] <IgnisDiabolus> :P
[04:31:41] <dr0id> :D LOL
[04:31:55] <aaronmcadam> you had the guys goin there tho
[04:31:56] <dr0id> maybe you mean, iSteveJobsQuit ?
[04:32:10] <IgnisDiabolus> too long, won't last in the market
[04:32:15] <dr0id> haha
[04:32:22] <NoNoNo> there is no need to be disrespectful
[04:32:37] <dr0id> Ubuntu is great is all I wanted to say. thank you
[04:33:09] <IgnisDiabolus> belated happy birthday Email!
[04:38:16] <djc> can someone tell me where (in 1.6.1) the "json" conversion/validation happens for $.ajax() calls?
[04:39:41] <aaronmcadam> djc: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/
[04:39:44] <aaronmcadam> look yourself :D
[04:39:53] <aaronmcadam> bump up ur version to 1.6.2 too
[04:40:18] <djc> I *was* looking myself
[04:40:33] <djc> but it seems somewhat convoluted
[04:41:00] <zeppo> alright, I have a masonry question.
[04:41:00] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[04:41:04] <johnline3> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
[04:41:10] <aaronmcadam> it's one of the most complicated methods in jQuery djc
[04:41:11] <johnline3> quite useful
[04:41:27] <aaronmcadam> drop the min for dev tho :)
[04:42:24] <djc> aaronmcadam: there's this dataTypes thing, but I don't understand where those converter functions are defined
[04:42:37] <Clorith> I want to trigger an event whe na user scrolls down on a page (so that I can move my menu to a fixed position, but not until the user has scrolled, ideally it will kick in after the user scrolls past X pixels for mthe top), is this doable?
[04:42:42] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[04:42:50] <aaronmcadam> it's just a string djc
[04:43:00] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't "convert" it to json for you
[04:43:14] <dismist> how can i put a callback function on a homemade function of mine (to make the function synchronous)
[04:44:23] <djc> aaronmcadam: if I set dataType: "json", it should do the conversion for me
[04:44:29] <djc> but it's getting stuck somehow
[04:44:30] <aaronmcadam> djc nope
[04:44:33] <aaronmcadam> it shouldn;t
[04:44:54] <aaronmcadam> you're just specifying the dataType for the transport, you're not actually stringifying it
[04:44:59] <aaronmcadam> you need to do that before
[04:45:13] <djc> err, this is the response JSON, not the requrest
[04:45:18] <djc> s/requrest/request/
[04:45:27] <aaronmcadam> right, well use $.parseJSON then
[04:45:39] <aaronmcadam> or $.getJSON
[04:45:45] <aaronmcadam> that will parse it for you djc
[04:46:09] <djc> aaronmcadam: I'm using $.ajax because I want to be able to specify an error handler
[04:46:16] <djc> which worked just fine before, but doesn't now
[04:46:17] <aaronmcadam> cool
[04:46:24] <aaronmcadam> well just use parseJSON then
[04:46:27] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem
[04:46:40] <djc> it's doing parseJSON for me because I set dataType: json
[04:46:44] <aaronmcadam> also jsonlint your response to make sure it's valid
[04:46:51] <djc> the response is fine
[04:47:48] <aaronmcadam> ah yeh
[04:47:51] <xp_prg> does lightbox use ajax?
[04:47:53] <aaronmcadam> and no errors?
[04:48:07] <aaronmcadam> lightbox? isn't that ancient?
[04:48:16] <xp_prg> what is better than lightbox?
[04:48:24] <zeppo> i use shadowbox for stuff
[04:48:35] <zeppo> http://www.shadowbox-js.com/
[04:48:55] <aaronmcadam> fancybox is my standard
[04:49:02] <aaronmcadam> or jq-ui-dialog
[04:49:12] <xp_prg> does fancybox use ajax?
[04:49:54] <zeppo> depends what you're doing with it
[04:50:11] <fayimora> xp_prg: if u have some form or something u need to do with ajax then yeah
[04:50:25] <xp_prg> does it load the pictures via ajax?
[04:50:28] <fayimora> depends on the content
[04:50:30] <fayimora> no
[04:50:38] <fayimora> pictures via location..lol
[04:50:42] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[04:50:49] <aaronmcadam> can't it use ajax all the time? :(
[04:51:10] <xp_prg> is there an ajax image gallery solution you are aware of?
[04:51:25] <xp_prg> what ajax stuff does fancybox use?
[04:51:26] <aaronmcadam> why must it be ajax?
[04:51:31] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[04:51:36] <xp_prg> its what I have been requested to get
[04:51:38] <twoface> you would probably be better finding a non-ajax solution you like, and then implement the ajax-stuff yourself
[04:51:45] <yii_noob> how could I permanently show a calendar?
[04:51:46] <zeppo> if you can write it without ajax its probably cleaner and better
[04:52:02] <zeppo> but it all depends
[04:52:03] <aaronmcadam> do u understand what ajax actually is xp_prg
[04:52:19] <xp_prg> yes, it is an asynchronous way to load content on a page via dhtml with divs
[04:52:25] <xp_prg> via callbacks
[04:52:42] <aaronmcadam> you can call anything but you're nearly there
[04:52:53] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to use ajax for everything tho
[04:53:02] <xp_prg> it is an http request with either xml or json inside of it
[04:53:05] <xp_prg> usually json
[04:53:17] <fayimora> i mostly use ajax for forms
[04:53:52] <aaronmcadam> it can be anything at all, doesn't even need to be an xhr, any transport will work now depending on support
[04:54:02] <zeppo> images you can just hide on the page and display in lightbox/fancybox whatever on click
[04:54:03] <pr0ton> xp_prg, you dont need to load images using ajax, simply adding a IMG tag to the DOM tree and setting it's src attrib will load the image
[04:54:14] <aaronmcadam> bingooo
[04:54:16] <zeppo> less requests to your server. its will be a lot faster and better
[04:54:30] <aaronmcadam> the images could load in the background
[04:54:32] <xp_prg> so I need to choose either shadowbox or fancybox, which one is better?
[04:54:35] <pr0ton> xp_prg, you might to use AJAX if you need to get the URIs of these images
[04:54:42] <aaronmcadam> I like fancybox, it's API is pretty solid
[04:54:43] <xp_prg> pr0ton right
[04:54:53] <pr0ton> xp_prg, so what is it that you want?
[04:55:01] <xp_prg> to fulfill the request of my boss
[04:55:02] <pr0ton> do you need to fetch the URIs of these images?
[04:55:13] <djc> okay, so in this situation, $.ajax() with datatype=text, then $.parseJSON(data) works, but $.ajax() with dataType=json fails
[04:55:16] <xp_prg> and to allow the users an ajax based image gallery solution in Drupal 6
[04:55:19] <djc> that seems like a bug, right?
[04:55:32] <pr0ton> djc maybe, 'datatype' ?
[04:55:51] <djc> that was a mistake reporting here, I actually have dataType
[04:55:59] <aaronmcadam> probably not
[04:56:08] <pr0ton> djc, ignore
[04:56:11] <yii_noob> yii
[04:56:14] <aaronmcadam> what happens if u log data?
[04:56:25] <aaronmcadam> php shit? :p
[04:56:26] <pr0ton> djc,  your server should send it with a mimetype of 'application/json'
[04:56:33] <djc> pr0ton: it does already
[04:56:47] <djc> aaronmcadam: if I log data, it shows a neat collection of valid JSON
[04:56:55] <aaronmcadam> right so
[04:56:59] <pr0ton> in that case, you dont need to set dataType
[04:57:01] <aaronmcadam> your cb func is wrong
[04:57:20] <djc> aaronmcadam: it's not
[04:57:34] <aaronmcadam> you can mock ajax requests on jsbin now so u can show us the code
[04:57:38] <djc> it used to work, I changed something orthogonal, then it failed
[04:57:59] <djc> specifically, if I add a method to Object.prototype, it starts failing
[04:58:30] <aaronmcadam> djc: http://jsbin.tumblr.com/post/9246335362/testing-ajax-requests-one-of-js-bins-original
[04:58:40] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:58:43] <aaronmcadam> and rightly so!
[04:59:07] <aaronmcadam> extending the prototype, especially Object, you should be shot :p
[04:59:23] <djc> I know it's a hack, but that's no reason to start failing on me weirdly
[04:59:38] <aaronmcadam> adding to the prototype in an async request? that's just stupid
[04:59:50] <aaronmcadam> just define it as a proper method and test
[05:00:13] <djc> not in the request, just somewhere else
[05:00:48] <aaronmcadam> get rid of it
[05:01:07] <aaronmcadam> that means nearly every other object will inherit that method, arrays, everything else
[05:01:27] <aaronmcadam> but it should still work yes
[05:01:39] <aaronmcadam> unless there's a naming collision
[05:01:48] <aaronmcadam> which is another reason not to extend Object
[05:02:50] <djc> ah, I'm guessing it might be a naming collision
[05:05:58] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, ah ok, but then it doesn't really do what it should
[05:06:13] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, the whole gray box should slide up, with all the contents.
[05:08:52] <NoNoNo> Ankabout: thats another problem ;)
[05:09:19] <Ankabout> NoNoNo, yes, I guess I didn't code it right then. But I have no idea how to go about it
[05:12:14] <IgnisDiabolus> hey Ankabout
[05:12:20] <Ankabout> hey IgnisDiabolus
[05:12:25] <IgnisDiabolus> what's the prob?
[05:13:14] <Ankabout> IgnisDiabolus, well basically I want to make nested divs slide up on clicking (or down on clicking elsewhere) to the next named anchor
[05:13:18] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/FqMTY/11/
[05:13:34] <Ankabout> I removed the anchors to test something though at the moment
[05:13:40] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/kpdS3/ why the readmore Link values doesn't change?
[05:13:47] <Ankabout> so if you click on the gray box, the next gray box should appear
[05:13:59] <amirite> hey spider
[05:14:10] <Ankabout> ravenzz, I looked at your code earlier. Why don't you make 2 divs, one read more, and one read less. and hide/show them when needed
[05:14:19] <Ankabout> hey amirite
[05:14:24] <amirite> :)
[05:14:41] <Ankabout> I dont speak Arabic though :)
[05:15:27] <ravenzz> Ankabout i can do that. But I suppose that it is not solving my issue
[05:15:43] <Ankabout> well then you just do it a different way, and it might work
[05:16:00] <Ankabout> ravenzz, the rest of your code goes beyond my jquery knowledge
[05:16:16] <Ankabout> I have the same sort of thing (read more/read less) but I do it completely differently
[05:16:21] <inad922> Is the data which is given to $.post()'s return function a string or it depends?
[05:16:27] <Ankabout> IgnisDiabolus, does it make sense what I'm trying to do?
[05:16:31] <ATrefz> hi everyone, i have a normal jQuery.fn.animate call which changes the position of an image by a small amount (40px) over 8000ms. It works fine everywhere, but in FF 3.6, 5 and 6 the CPU goes crazy and skyrockets to 70%-100%
[05:16:45] <ravenzz> Ankabout would you show me that? :)
[05:17:35] <ATrefz> is there any explanation/fix for that? shouldn`t that be a simple setTimeout?
[05:18:16] <Ankabout> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/3a2GS/
[05:18:21] <Ankabout> can't add the HTML right now
[05:18:37] <zeppo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/459224/jquery-animate-and-browser-performance
[05:19:00] <ravenzz> np
[05:19:09] <ravenzz> btw i suppose that is better to toggle()
[05:19:49] <IgnisDiabolus> Ankabout $('.image[name="Three"]').slideToggle();
[05:19:57] <ravenzz> i have just this stupid issue with the value of the "Read more" link
[05:20:18] <IgnisDiabolus> http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/
[05:20:44] <Ankabout> IgnisDiabolus, is it possible that the children of "image" don't move with?
[05:21:08] <IgnisDiabolus> wait what?
[05:22:28] <IgnisDiabolus> Ankabout, you can append the children to another div :3
[05:22:52] <EriksLV> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2945223
[05:23:08] <Ankabout> IgnisDiabolus, the title and client are children of the image div, yet when it slides, they don't slide with
[05:23:35] <IgnisDiabolus> $('#somediv').append($('.image[name="Three"]').children());
[05:23:48] <IgnisDiabolus> what? is that a problem or that is the action that you want to do?
[05:23:59] <Ankabout> I think maybe slidetoggle is not what I need.
[05:24:30] <Ankabout> see there are 3 gray boxes, and at the start, the first one is in the red box. when I click, the next one should appear in there, and so on
[05:26:42] <Ankabout> IgnisDiabolus, looks like slidetoggle might not be what I need actually...
[05:27:16] <Ankabout> ravenzz, figured it out?
[05:27:19] <IgnisDiabolus> :3
[05:27:42] <Ankabout> IgnisDiabolus, see what I mean?
[05:27:54] <IgnisDiabolus> ravenzz, make some if else statement
[05:28:04] <ravenzz> Ankabout no
[05:28:46] <ravenzz> i wouldn't do something like $(this).text() == "foo" ? "bar" : "foo";
[05:29:01] <IgnisDiabolus> if you say so
[05:29:28] <knubbze> what's wrong with an inline-if ?
[05:30:37] <ATrefz> knubbze: its less readable, everything else is the same
[05:30:53] <ravenzz> that works, of course
[05:31:13] <ravenzz> i just want to figure out why the toggle() ones doesn't
[05:32:14] <IgnisDiabolus> coz maybe it accepts only one callback. hmmm
[05:32:58] <MattWeb101>  how do you check for an empty input box? and many at one time.?
[05:33:50] <ravenzz> if ($('checkbox:checked').length)
[05:33:59] <zabka> hi all, what could be the rreason, that $('.class').mouseover(function(){alert("bla"}); doesnt fire? same with mouseenter. thx
[05:34:04] <ravenzz> az lol
[05:34:13] <ravenzz> empty input box.. i am sleepy
[05:34:31] <MattWeb101> text field.
[05:34:39] <ravenzz> yes sorry
[05:34:54] <MattWeb101> np, I'm in no hurry
[05:34:57] <IgnisDiabolus> $('input[type="text"]).each(function() { /* check if this is empty */ }); i guess so
[05:35:11] <IgnisDiabolus> btw, where are the experts?
[05:35:37] <Ankabout> I wish they were here IgnisDiabolus, I've been struggling with this for days
[05:36:11] <IgnisDiabolus> sorry ravenzz, is it really ok with .toggle to have to callback functions? I've only seen it with hover
[05:36:28] <ATrefz> zabka: something lies over the field, or the handler gets unbound
[05:36:54] <IgnisDiabolus> s/to callback/two callback
[05:37:06] <erichynds> yes
[05:37:07] <MattWeb101> but, how do you check, like this  var fname = $('#fname').val();, if(fname = '' || lname =''){}
[05:37:36] <zabka> ATrefz: well... i have a table. and a div (over which a wanna have mousover) in <td>
[05:38:35] <erichynds> MattWeb101: just like that. if( !$("#fname").val().length || !$("#lname").val().length ){}
[05:39:06] <theCode> how do you make a draggable non-greedy?
[05:39:07] <MattWeb101> but where is the =''
[05:39:25] <erichynds> it doesn't exist
[05:39:37] <erichynds> = is for assignment, not for equality checking
[05:39:37] <zabka> ATrefz: <td <%=x_style%>><div class="msg_id" id="<%=gRS("msg_id")%>"> <%=i%></div></td>. im trying to have hover over div
[05:39:44] <erichynds> you can do .val() == "" if you'd rather
[05:39:46] <erichynds> same thing
[05:40:32] <ravenzz> MattWeb101 if there is no value..its length is 0
[05:40:47] <zabka> ATrefz: is this td blocking?
[05:41:05] <MattWeb101>  yeah I know
[05:41:11] <ravenzz> or rather false
[05:41:27] <MattWeb101> oh ok.
[05:41:31] <blackspotwiggins> 0 which is falsy
[05:41:41] <MattWeb101> so I don't have to do >0
[05:41:50] <ravenzz> right
[05:42:22] <ravenzz> anything > 0 is true
[05:42:32] <ajpiano> technically he could get away with
[05:42:33] <erichynds> and < 0
[05:42:38] <ravenzz> of course
[05:42:49] <ravenzz> but with length you can't have negative values
[05:42:52] <ajpiano> if ( ! ($("#foo").val() || $("#bar").val()) ) { }
[05:43:04] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, if the value is "0" ?
[05:43:20] <ajpiano> blackspotwiggins: empty string == falsy, non empty string .... truthy
[05:43:25] <ravenzz> but maybe he is trying to do something like $('input[value!=""]')
[05:43:34] <ajpiano> ?eval !!"0"
[05:43:55] <aaronmcadam> hey guys, here's how to mock ajax requests on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/q8Qdb/
[05:44:36] <aaronmcadam> ?g are you alive?
[05:44:42] <MattWeb101> I'll post what I got.
[05:44:46] <aaronmcadam> can we please mirror bot-t :(
[05:44:50] <ravenzz> ajpiano actually i think that you are the only that can help me: http://jsfiddle.net/kpdS3/
[05:45:03] <aaronmcadam> is there anyone else who can sort it out ajpiano? :) how's it going today anyway
[05:45:04] <ajpiano> is this one of those help me obi wan kenobi moments
[05:45:08] <ravenzz> what's wrong with the toggle() ..the read more one
[05:45:18] <ravenzz> yes :D
[05:45:19] <MattWeb101> http://jsfiddle.net/WWGrN/
[05:45:22] <aaronmcadam> princess lea in a wee hologram moment
[05:46:11] <Naikrovek> Hey experts, is there a way to open a dialog while specifying that it be modal AND have a minimum width?  I have this, I need a minimal width parameter set as well: $('#dialog').dialog({modal: true});
[05:46:43] <MattWeb101> could someone check my code?
[05:46:45] <MattWeb101> http://jsfiddle.net/WWGrN/
[05:46:49] <MattWeb101> thanks
[05:46:52] <erichynds> Naikrovek: UI dialog has a minWidth option
[05:46:57] <aaronmcadam> autoOpen:false Naikrovek
[05:47:12] <aaronmcadam> ohh soz misread it hehe
[05:47:14] <Ankabout> is there anyone that can help me with my sliding issue?
[05:47:23] <ajpiano> ?linaf @ MattWeb101
[05:47:23] <bot-t> MattWeb101, .length is not a function, it is a property. $("div").length, not $("div").length()
[05:47:31] <Ankabout> I want to make a jcarousel-like slider
[05:47:38] <anli_> Can I compare two jquery encapsulated elements by using foo.get(0) == goo.get(0)?
[05:47:46] <ajpiano> anli_: yes
[05:47:49] <anli_> I see in the jquery ui datepicker src that they compare id
[05:47:52] <ravenzz> MattWeb101 do you want to select all the empty fields?
[05:47:57] <anli_> Seems to be better to compare elements
[05:47:59] <Naikrovek> erichynds: yes, but how can i specify it along with the modal option?  I can't find a syntax that lets me do both
[05:48:11] <erichynds> Naikrovek: .dialog({ modal: false, minWidth: 200 })
[05:48:12] <MattWeb101> yeah, eventually.
[05:48:29] <erichynds> Naikrovek: eer, moda: true in your case
[05:48:31] <aaronmcadam> anli_: you might wanna use ===
[05:48:32] <erichynds> modal
[05:48:47] <Naikrovek> erichynds: i'm sure i tried that.. let me try again.
[05:49:19] <ATrefz> anli_: yeah, but for that - use ===
[05:49:48] <MattWeb101> ok, nvm I got it. Thanks.
[05:50:05] <Naikrovek> erichynds: that's it.  I guess I never capitalized the 'w' before.  Thanks a ton!
[05:50:16] <erichynds> sweet
[05:50:53] <ajpiano> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/kpdS3/2/
[05:50:57] <ajpiano> i wouldn't use togle there at all
[05:51:26] <ajpiano> ravenzz: your mistake was assuming that by binding the toggle in the click, it would be in the right state, in reality, it was bound to be flipped
[05:51:46] <geekbuntu> erichynds, g'mornin'  you think it would be insane to put animations inside the notify plugin you made?
[05:51:48] <geekbuntu> :-D
[05:51:59] <aaronmcadam> least u learned a bit of italian doin it ajpiano :)
[05:52:04] <anli_> atrefz: Why? The type should be object anyway
[05:52:08] <erichynds> geekbuntu: nope, that would be simple
[05:52:22] <ajpiano> lol
[05:52:25] <geekbuntu> was thinking about imksy's wiggle
[05:52:27] <aaronmcadam> *should* isn't great, best to be sure
[05:52:27] <ravenzz> ajpiano and what about $('foo').click().toggle(); ?
[05:52:32] <geekbuntu> wold be a nice attention getter
[05:52:35] <ajpiano> ravenzz: i just don't see the point
[05:52:49] <ajpiano> you can handle all the logic inside of a single click handler
[05:53:19] <erichynds> geekbuntu: ping mekwall when you see him, he has a fork of mine that's better
[05:53:38] <geekbuntu> cool thanks erichynds
[05:53:48] <zabka> how can i check if a handler  is bound?
[05:53:54] <ravenzz> ajpiano no wait maybe i misunderstood, my english is horrible
[05:54:43] <ravenzz> ok i got it
[05:55:41] <ravenzz> ajpiano thank you
[05:57:22] <ravenzz> ajpiano uhm why it slides only when it is going to be hidden?
[05:58:24] <ravenzz> i have a fadein effect on show even though i set slide
[06:04:48] <geekbuntu> erichynds, that's perfect thanks (mekwall)
[06:05:58] <mekwall> geekbuntu: haven't updated that fork for quite some time, but you'll might find it useful :)
[06:06:24] <Gavrisimo> hey people, i have some strange issue with http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position when i put display: none on element that i want to position, positioning doesnt work properly. is that normal behaviour?
[06:06:38] <geekbuntu> mekwall, i have not looked at the source yet, but i would be surprised if it could even deprecate
[06:06:41] <Gavrisimo> i am showing it later when i hover on some element
[06:07:02] <geekbuntu> mekwall, please (PLEASE) tell me you're still working on milk - <---looks amazing
[06:07:47] <Hussein> hey, i have a slight bug. im using datepicker with the following options: { dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy', minDate: new Date() }    and where im expecting to see the month number i'm actually seeing minutes
[06:08:22] <Hussein> but the docs clearly state "mm" will return the month with leading 0
[06:09:00] <mekwall> geekbuntu: its on ice atm... I'm more or less in between jobs and I'm not sure I'm going to have any use of it anymore
[06:09:18] <mekwall> geekbuntu: but it's open sourced so feel free to fork :P
[06:09:18] <Ankabout> how do I scroll to the next child element using jquery?
[06:10:09] <blainsd> what's milk ?
[06:10:26] <geekbuntu> mekwall, milk is a game changer... if it works as a router too (dispatcher for php)... it could make you famous. most ppl build either a framework or a router - you combined them - even to use json...very very impressive... looks great on a resume too
[06:10:34] <mekwall> blainsd: milk is like karate
[06:10:38] * geekbuntu milk comes from cows silly
[06:11:00] <anli_> I tried just for fun to contribute to jquery ui development. It wasnt that hard
[06:11:02] <blainsd> who's got milk ?
[06:11:17] <geekbuntu> look in fridge :-D
[06:11:50] <geekbuntu> mekwall, let me know if you work on it again will pm my email - if you need something holler - i will help or find it for you
[06:12:18] <DarsVaeda> milk on ice...hmm I'm interested
[06:12:35] <mekwall> geekbuntu: just follow it on github
[06:12:40] <mekwall> then you'll know :)
[06:12:44] <geekbuntu> mekwall, ok
[06:12:58] <JKarsrud> milk sucks mekwall. it's in the wrong language :D
[06:13:54] <geekbuntu> JKarsrud, i use python 90% of the time, but PHP is in desperate need of such an animal as milk
[06:14:12] <mekwall> JKarsrud: the reason why I'm not so certain I will continue developing it :p
[06:14:16] <geekbuntu> zend/cake/ignitor or way overkill and still do not effective manage routes
[06:14:25] <JKarsrud> geekbuntu: believe me, I know. I'm just referring to mekwall's use of node lately :)
[06:14:40] <mekwall> yup... node is king :)
[06:14:51] <dr0id> node.js ?
[06:14:54] <geekbuntu> JKarsrud, i want to learn express+node.js   no time
[06:15:06] <JKarsrud> dr0id: yes.
[06:15:09] * geekbuntu never enough time
[06:15:10] <ajpiano> "no time" is the amount of time it takes to learn express and node
[06:15:10] <ajpiano> :p
[06:15:18] <JKarsrud> ajpiano++
[06:15:18] <anli_> Ah, had to do that pull request
[06:15:19] <Ankabout> how do I scroll to a named anchor using jquery within a parent div?
[06:15:58] <JKarsrud> geekbuntu: seriously, node+express takes no time at all
[06:16:04] <mekwall> ajpiano: hell yeah :D
[06:16:16] <mekwall> its why its called express :D
[06:16:37] <mekwall> I built my own npm package in my first month using node
[06:16:50] <mikouRoux> Hello, How can I get target the parent of a parent ?
[06:16:53] <MattWeb101> it still didn't work for me I want to check multuple lengths of inputs and if any of them are false I want to go through the false script
[06:17:11] <JKarsrud> if you have node installed, just $ npm install express -g && express projectname && node app.js
[06:17:13] <JKarsrud> BAM
[06:17:14] <fuchstronaut> (mikouRoux): .parent().parent()
[06:17:24] <byomkeshbakshi> hi i want to replicate functionality shown here http://www.seamless.com/food-delivery/Rice-Shop-Jersey-City.3979.r, when hovered over menu item, a popup is shown displaying some content. how can I do this in jquery?
[06:17:26] <fuchstronaut> (mikouRoux): or use .closest()
[06:17:30] <mikouRoux> fushstronaut Pretty easy !
[06:17:36] <mikouRoux> :-) thanks
[06:18:11] <manhunter> hi
[06:18:29] <manhunter> after clicking a button it calls this ajax function,http://bpaste.net/show/18339/
[06:18:36] <manhunter> with data taking from radiobutton
[06:18:36] <MattWeb101> it still didn't work for me I want to check multuple lengths of inputs and if any of them are false I want to go through the false script, http://jsfiddle.net/V9qMT/
[06:18:52] <manhunter> how can i call that ajax in browswer url manually ? is it possible ?
[06:19:15] <fuchstronaut> (manhunter): you can set window.location to alter the url
[06:19:48] <manhunter> fuchstronaut: i want to hit the url manually with data
[06:20:01] <anli_> If I have  a div with children and I want to check if the user clicked outside, I need to use !div.is('.fooclass,.fooclass *') right?
[06:20:39] <manhunter>  i want to see the result without clicking the button
[06:20:41] <fuchstronaut> (MattWeb101): That's not you access the input's value, take a look at .val()
[06:20:53] <ajpiano> MattWeb101: i'm working on a demo for you
[06:21:06] <ajpiano> but FYI, you can't cancel the submit of a form by canceling the click on a button
[06:21:07] <MattWeb101> ok, great thanks,
[06:21:15] <ajpiano> that's why you fire form validation logic on form submit
[06:21:36] <fuchstronaut> (manhunter): you can read the url by taking a look at window.location, but im not sure if i understood you right
[06:24:12] <manhunter> fuchstronaut: i want to see the same result of an ajax call
[06:24:47] <manhunter> fuchstronaut: without an event clicking, just hitting it with data to url
[06:25:27] * geekbuntu wow the names are so.... blue oyster
[06:25:48] <ajpiano> MattWeb101: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/WWGrN/3/
[06:26:50] <MattWeb101> ok great thanks
[06:27:08] <mekwall> geekbuntu: https://github.com/mekwall/milk/blob/master/tests/dispatcher/simple.yaml <--- I prefer that ;)
[06:27:44] <kborchers> ajpiano: fyi, you had already fixed his issue last night. once i got some images in and could see it working, everything worked as expected. he had some cache issues in IE but once he cleared that, everything worked right.
[06:27:54] <ajpiano> kborchers: lol
[06:28:06] <geekbuntu> mekwall, irony... i was almost there https://github.com/geekbuntu/milk/tree/master/examples/routes
[06:28:13] <geekbuntu> (working towards it anyways)
[06:28:13] <kborchers> last i heard he was going to test older IE's but should have been good to go
[06:28:26] <kborchers> at least i had an excuse to use placekitten.com :D
[06:28:42] <imgrey> good day #jquery
[06:28:48] <imgrey> does somebody know if ther's a tool for generating configuration for javascript ?
[06:28:48] <dr0id> night bro
[06:28:51] <antihero> I know this sounds insane but I want to check before telling a client - can you put javascript (for instance a Facebook "like") button in an e-mail?
[06:28:55] <imgrey> http://pastie.org/2459918
[06:29:01] <imgrey> I need to take such javascript and take docs for it
[06:29:08] <imgrey> to receive html in output
[06:29:39] <DarsVaeda> geekbuntu: why are you using classes, mvc, namespaces but then mix html and php?
[06:30:51] <geekbuntu> DarsVaeda, i am not a mvc fan... i'm using jquery tmpl (may learn knockout) - but using a dispatcher is good for ajax calls - the namespace & classes are good for RESTFul responses with the ajax calls
[06:31:28] <DarsVaeda> oh wait your the wrong guy :D
[06:31:42] <DarsVaeda> (or girl)
[06:31:50] <geekbuntu> DarsVaeda, yay :-P
[06:31:56] <DarsVaeda> I wanted to adress that milky guy
[06:34:01] <Ankabout> how do I scroll to a named anchor using jquery within a parent div?
[06:35:53] <richthegeek> I'm trying to diagnose an IE8 issue with jQuery UI dialog - it's throwing an "Object doesn't support this property or method" error
[06:36:29] <richthegeek> I've checked dependencies, checked each config option in turn, googled heavily... to no avail
[06:36:35] <richthegeek> anyone experienced this before?
[06:36:56] <byomkeshbakshi> hi i need to do a simple popup disloag with jquery, which method or plugin to use?
[06:37:03] <byomkeshbakshi> dialog
[06:37:14] <anli_> What is Trac?
[06:37:27] <richthegeek> byomkeshbakshi: jQuery UI dialog
[06:37:34] <richthegeek> anli_: a bug tracking system
[06:37:49] <anli_> ok
[06:38:09] <byomkeshbakshi> richthegeek: yes trying that, but I am getting error dialog is not a function. I have included the jqueryui lib also. How to debug such error?
[06:38:30] <kborchers> Ankabout: i believe what you would need to do is get the anchor's position relative to the div, then you can set the parent div's scrollTop to the anchor's top coordinate. something like that, let me see if i can throw together a demo
[06:38:41] <richthegeek> byomkeshbakshi: try including the jQuery UI from the Google CDN (includes all sub-scripts)
[06:38:42] <Ankabout> kborchers
[06:38:45] <Ankabout> I have a jsfiddle
[06:38:53] <kborchers> link?
[06:39:51] <Ankabout> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/4/
[06:40:17] <Ankabout> the jquery is all BS, was just for testing with different markup
[06:40:26] <kborchers> ok
[06:40:42] <Ankabout> kborchers, I have to go offline for 10 mins.... I'll be back in 10, have to move to a different office quick...
[06:43:50] <jgspratt> hello.  with http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-select, what is "index"?  an integer?  an ID?
[06:44:27] <richthegeek> jgspratt: it is the index of the element within the parent
[06:44:31] <richthegeek> so the first element has index of 0
[06:44:33] <richthegeek> second has 1
[06:44:36] <richthegeek> third has 2
[06:44:37] <richthegeek> and so on
[06:44:49] <jgspratt> thanks!
[06:45:32] <subdee> hello everyone. I have an issue, I am making an ajax call and the URL is correct, meaning that the script does get executed, but right after the call, Javascript crashes with an error and prevents me from catching the response data. The error thrown is (an empty string). Any ideas?
[06:46:25] <richthegeek> subdee: I assume the call is returning some data format like JSON/XML?
[06:46:47] <subdee> richthegeek: no, the call is returning a 1 or 0
[06:46:51] <subdee> simple boolean
[06:47:06] <richthegeek> subdee: are you sure that it's actually returning that?
[06:47:10] <richthegeek> try alert'ing the response
[06:47:15] <richthegeek> that will pause the exec until you can read
[06:47:24] <subdee> richthegeek: yes positive, i've console.log'd it
[06:47:38] <subdee> besides the crash happens before the script has finished responding
[06:47:48] <richthegeek> very strange
[06:47:58] <jgspratt> richthegeek: it works!
[06:48:09] <subdee> let me paste some code for you, one sec
[06:48:45] <subdee> richthegeek: http://pastebin.com/VEjYbCuc
[06:50:15] <richthegeek> subdee: are you sure about the window.location.replace argument requirements?
[06:50:25] <richthegeek> subdee: might require an absolute url, perhaps
[06:51:39] <subdee> the window/replace works, the problem is I never get to that point
[06:51:53] <subdee> it goes to the error function, it is not succesful
[06:52:35] <subdee> and no clue why it fails
[06:52:40] <subdee> since the script does get called
[06:52:58] <richthegeek> might be returning a non-expected type
[06:52:58] <subdee> i mean the php script
[06:53:06] <richthegeek> perhaps manually force the expected return
[06:53:16] <richthegeek> or just use the $.get method instead of $.ajax
[06:53:21] <subdee> hmm
[06:53:26] <subdee> how do i force the expected return?
[06:53:56] <subdee> by dataType?
[06:54:21] <richthegeek> yeah
[06:54:25] <richthegeek> dataType: 'text'
[06:54:56] <richthegeek> might be that your server sends a Content-type header other than text/plain
[06:55:01] <subdee> ok i'll give it a shot
[06:55:43] <yii_noob> can i get a input value with d1 = $( "#Reports_start_date" ).val(); ?
[06:56:00] <richthegeek> yii_noob: that's what val() is for
[06:56:12] <yii_noob> var d1 = $( "#Reports_new_sites_start_date" ).val();                console.log(d1);
[06:56:17] <yii_noob> that shows nothing
[06:56:20] <yii_noob> in firebug
[06:56:27] <richthegeek> shows nothing or shows "undefined"/"null"?
[06:56:35] <yii_noob> nothing
[06:56:42] <Ankabout> kborchers, I'm back
[06:56:49] <Ankabout> sorry about that
[06:56:56] <richthegeek> yii_noob: then it's returning an empty string
[06:57:18] <yii_noob> that filed has a date value
[06:57:31] <kborchers> Ankabout: no problem ... almost got something for you
[06:57:52] <richthegeek> yii_noob: you might be targeting the wrong field without knowing about it
[06:57:58] <richthegeek> ID's are *meant* to be unique
[06:58:02] <Ankabout> kborchers, cool, I'm waiting anxiously :)
[06:59:18] <xec> yii_noob: show us your code, what is that id selecting?
[07:00:34] <kborchers> Ankabout: here you go. it is very specific to this demo but it should get you on the path to make it work in your real situation http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/rVTNv/5/
[07:01:15] <Ankabout> kborchers, oh awesome!! thanks
[07:01:19] <kborchers> np
[07:01:27] <Ankabout> can I ask some follow-up qs?
[07:02:15] <kborchers> sure
[07:02:25] <yii_noob> I have a d1=07/01/2011 and I try to set that as a default date with $( "#cal1" ).datepicker( "option", "defaultDate", d1 );
[07:02:31] <yii_noob> where I do wrong please ?
[07:02:33] <Ankabout> if I go to the URL using #One, will it still work?
[07:02:39] <subdee> richthegeek: no luck. but the request URL it is making with $.get is wrong. Instead of giving the parameter name and value it says: [object Object]
[07:02:56] <subdee> that's what I see in firebug at least
[07:03:00] <kborchers> no, you would need to handle that see ?bbq
[07:03:01] <bot-t> no, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[07:03:18] <richthegeek> strnageness
[07:03:52] <Ankabout> ah cool...
[07:03:56] <subdee> indeed
[07:04:10] <subdee> the PHP script still gets called though
[07:04:13] <Ankabout> kborchers, alright, then one more thing...
[07:04:15] <subdee> unbelievable
[07:04:17] <kborchers> Ankabout: you could use just the hashchange plugin piece of that and then trigger a click on the image specified in the url
[07:04:54] <Ankabout> kborchers, it wouldn't need to scroll, it just needs to start on that spot, but I see where you're going with it.
[07:05:48] <kborchers> Ankabout: that animation was just for prettiness ;)  you can just set scrollTop and it will jump straight there
[07:05:59] <Ankabout> kborchers, the last thing I can't figure out, is I will nee the previous block to still be displayed a bit at the top, with the active one being positioned at the bottom of the container... this is just CSS right?
[07:06:09] <Ankabout> kborchers, no the prettiness I needed :)
[07:06:11] <Ankabout> thanks!!!
[07:06:14] <Ankabout> kborchers++
[07:06:22] <Ankabout> (if there's even a karma bot here)
[07:10:24] <engaged> Is there a way on a button click to have this audio player start playing? http://wpaudioplayer.com/standalone/
[07:10:53] <kborchers> Ankabout: yeah, you'll need to mess with the css and the scrollTo var's calculation to get that to work
[07:13:29] <Ankabout> kborchers, what's the *20 for?
[07:13:45] <kborchers> Ankabout: your bottom margin on the image
[07:13:51] <Ankabout> ahh ok
[07:13:59] <Ankabout> makes sense...
[07:15:03] <DNX> hi guys, how can I select a "p" element inside a $(this) element ?
[07:15:23] <chachan> DNX, $("p", $(this))
[07:15:36] <DNX> chachan, thank you
[07:15:47] <chachan> DNX, the second selector creates a context
[07:16:06] <knubbze> wouldn't $(this).find("p") not be correct also?
[07:16:17] <DNX> I'll try
[07:17:02] <subdee> richthegeek: just to keep you updated, I found my stupid problem, I was catching the click event from a submit button to call the ajax function instead of catching the submit event of the form
[07:17:14] <subdee> so the request had already started and ajax failed
[07:17:28] <chachan> knubbze, I guess so. I rather use selectors instead of functions (personal opinion), I'm not sure if there's a difference
[07:18:31] <Ankabout> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/8/
[07:18:33] <Ankabout> thanks!!
[07:18:49] <kborchers> no problem
[07:21:07] <DNX> any qtip guru here? in content->text: $("p", $(this)) doesn't work
[07:21:43] <DNX> I select qtip elements by class
[07:22:38] <DNX> example from here: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/content/
[07:23:24] <Ankabout> kborchers, when I get to it, I might need some help with this bbq stuff
[07:23:45] <Ankabout> I get basic jquery like toggles and slides and stuff, but a lot is a bit beyond my knowledge
[07:24:27] <kborchers> Ankabout: ok, it's pretty straight forward. like i said, you if read it, you may only need the hashchange plugin which is linked from that page. maybe this works see ?hashchange
[07:24:27] <bot-t> Ankabout, Ben Alman's hashchange enables very basic bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser HTML5 window.onhashchange event. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[07:24:32] <kborchers> yep, that one
[07:25:36] <kborchers> Ankabout: i'm in here pretty often so if you have questions, just ping me
[07:26:12] <Ankabout> yeah it will probably make sense to me, but just in case. So basically the script would check if there's a hash in the URL on loading, and then quickly do whatever it needs to to get the right div in view right?
[07:29:38] <kborchers> Ankabout: basically, yes. it recognizes that there is a hash, then you have to tell it what to do (i.e. move to the correct image)
[07:29:56] <Ankabout> excellent. should be able to figure it out. thanks again
[07:30:09] <kborchers> on page load, i think you'll actually need to trigger the hashchange event but that should be in the docs/examples
[07:32:38] <Dave_Stein> Ankabout i use that plugin frequently
[07:32:46] <Dave_Stein> Ankabout kborchers is right
[07:32:56] <BillCriswell> I'd like to keep all my scripts in one file and I was wondering what's the best way to only run some code on a particular page. I have <body id="sitename" class="home"> so I was thinking of doing if( $('body.home').length > 0 ) but I'm sure there's better ways?
[07:33:16] <Dave_Stein> I do:
[07:33:16] <Dave_Stein> $(window).bind( 'hashchange', MyObj.route );
[07:33:16] <Dave_Stein>         MyObj.route();
[07:33:46] <Dave_Stein> BillCriswell - i do same way to detect page but you don't want all your scripts in one file thats a mess in the end :)
[07:34:45] <BillCriswell> Dave_Stein: I have them all separated when I'm working on it but then I combine them all into one script and minimized when it's saved.
[07:34:48] <Ankabout> Dave_Stein, so the hashchange is the event that already exists, or do I need the plugin for that?
[07:35:46] <kborchers> Ankabout: i believe hashchange only exists in some browsers so you need the plugin to support older browsers
[07:35:54] <Ankabout> ah ok
[07:36:08] <Ankabout> well I'm at a different location right now, so just collecting the information I need for later
[07:36:32] <kborchers> Ankabout: that's explained in the second heading on the plugin page ;)
[07:36:44] <Ankabout> the CMS will output the markup, but I can make the divs have a named anchor and stuff, it's just to facilitate linking to specific images rather than always starting at the first
[07:37:01] <Ankabout> kborchers, yeah I just glanced real quick, not 'busy' with it yet :)
[07:37:03] <Dave_Stein> Ankabout hashchange is the event that the plugin does
[07:37:40] <Dave_Stein> BillCriswell gotcha
[07:38:45] <Dave_Stein> im apparently one step behind kborchers as i keep getting up ;)
[07:39:05] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: no, you're just reinforcing l)
[07:40:52] <Dave_Stein> kborchers why arent you @kborchers on twitter haha
[07:41:18] <gar_onn> G-Male: http://youtu.be/dx-cX7W03R , "Google created the perfect male" lol
[07:41:41] <kborchers> because some chick that hasn't tweeted for 3 years is sitting on it >:(
[07:41:51] <kborchers> i'm @k_borchers
[07:42:11] <enjoycrf> mama?
[07:42:57] <Dave_Stein> i feel your pain with @davestein which is why i have underscore
[07:43:07] <daninma> i wrote a function to show a collection of form validation errors. it fades in each error div and updates a line in the header that shows a total count of errors. I was wondering how do I update the header when the fadeIn starts, instead of when it finishes? http://jsfiddle.net/g3m97/1/
[07:43:26] <saml> hey, I have  a jQuery object. I want to return first matching DOM element.
[07:43:31] <saml> jq.get().dom() ?
[07:43:59] <blackspotwiggins> .get(0) actually works
[07:44:05] <blackspotwiggins> or [0]
[07:44:09] <enjoycrf> whats the diff?
[07:44:10] <Dave_Stein> i think he means the first thing in the array that matches to a dom
[07:44:13] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: i complain to them about once a month and they keep feeding me the same line about how they are working on a method for removing inactive accounts and i should check back in a few months ... for the last year
[07:44:14] <enjoycrf> dinima
[07:44:15] <Dave_Stein> not the first in the list
[07:44:15] <saml> what's best practice?
[07:44:18] <blackspotwiggins> ah, sry get() doesnt work
[07:44:20] <saml> jq  could be empty
[07:44:22] <blackspotwiggins> [0] is easyest
[07:44:25] <Dave_Stein> kborchers same here
[07:44:38] <gar_onn> I think [0]is bes
[07:44:50] <saml> oh yah. [0] returns undefined if nothing is matched
[07:44:50] <blackspotwiggins> man, my spelling sucks today
[07:45:09] <gar_onn> becouse you don't need to call an extra method from jQ, you just use the native one witch is always faser
[07:45:11] <saml> so how does  jQuery('.asd')[0]  work?
[07:45:20] <Dave_Stein> returns first matched DOM node
[07:45:22] <saml> jQuery('.asd')   returns plain javascript Array ?
[07:45:27] <gar_onn> jup
[07:45:38] <saml> oh cool thanks
[07:45:39] <enjoycrf> jup?
[07:45:39] <Dave_Stein> saml that returns a jQuery Array with all the functions youd expect
[07:45:46] <Dave_Stein> but if you do [0] on it, it comes the native node
[07:45:47] <gar_onn> a special jQuery array
[07:45:58] <daninma> anyone have a sec to take a look at thsi for me?
[07:46:15] <saml> did jQuery override  [i]?  or javascript won't let you override [i], right?
[07:46:37] <gar_onn> no
[07:46:40] <blackspotwiggins> saml, jquery object has array prototype i think
[07:46:44] <saml> nevermind,  [][0] is undefined too.. i thoguht it'll throw an exception
[07:47:19] <gar_onn> what Is your line of code now saml?
[07:48:12] <saml> addTagBubbleTo(jQuery('#tag-bubbles')[0], tagValue)
[07:54:13] <daninma> i wrote a function to show a collection of form validation errors. it fades in each error div and updates a line in the header that shows a total count of errors. I was wondering how do I update the header when the fadeIn starts, instead of when it finishes? http://jsfiddle.net/g3m97/1/  thanks!!
[07:55:18] <hariom> Is there any plugin or function to pick date and time as well?
[07:55:42] <mekwall> daninma: just put the update before the fadein? :)
[07:56:12] <daninma> tried that, this is in an each loop, doesnt work the way i thought it would
[07:56:35] <hariom> calender with date and time
[07:58:34] <daninma> it cant be that hard, I'm just missing something in the logic
[07:58:41] <kborchers> hariom: i have not used it but see ?g ui timepicker
[07:58:42] <bot-t> hariom, Adding a Timepicker to jQuery UI Datepicker - http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[07:59:37] <jeffsmykil> Any tips on how to run a functin every 30 seconds after the page loads?
[07:59:57] <saml> window.setInterval?
[07:59:59] <kborchers> ?setTimeout @ jeffsmykil
[07:59:59] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[08:00:56] <jeffsmykil> ty kborchers
[08:01:41] <daninma> ok well if anyone else has any thoughts on it please let me know, having a hard time figuring this out
[08:01:50] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: for some reason i don't like setInterval ... i just use setTimeout and recursively call the function after each timeout
[08:03:54] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: my book says: setTimeout(function() { my.Object.method(); }, 3000);
[08:04:31] <hariom> kborchers: thanks
[08:04:39] <kborchers> np
[08:07:53] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: only problem is my example seems to run right away
[08:08:27] <kborchers> ?demo @ jeffsmykil
[08:08:28] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:09:31] <jeffsmykil> we were just talking about
[08:09:39] <jeffsmykil> i posted my code
[08:09:42] <saml> given a dom element, how do you get first sibling that is <button class="tag">   ?
[08:09:51] <jeffsmykil> just want to delay it on load and thereafter
[08:09:54] <jeffsmykil> not thereafter
[08:09:58] <saml> jQuery(domEl).parent('button.tag')  ?
[08:10:30] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: i didn't see your code, can you post the link again?
[08:10:56] <saml> oh there is .siblings()
[08:11:05] <aaronmcadam> saml: yeah a parent is not a sibling
[08:11:06] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: setTimeout(function() { my.Object.method(); }, 3000);
[08:11:16] <aaronmcadam> saml: siblings().first()
[08:13:27] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: that will run after 3 seconds, for 30 you need 30000, you could also write that as setTimeout(my.Object.method, 30000);
[08:13:50] <jeffsmykil> but it is running on intial load
[08:14:16] <kborchers> make sure you aren't calling that method somewhere else
[08:15:02] <kborchers> for every 30 seconds you would then add a line to the end of your function that calls itself within another setTimeout
[08:15:23] <jeffsmykil> thats confusing
[08:15:30] <jeffsmykil> i appear to be calling it somewhere else
[08:15:31] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[08:16:50] <polygon-pusher> whats the method used to go to a new url?
[08:17:29] <polygon-pusher> something like window.location?
[08:17:53] <twoface> location.href = 'foo'
[08:18:37] <falcom> hey guys, is there a method where i can wrap some element with another element + inserting a sibling element? ( elemA --->  <div wrapper> elemA elemB </div> )
[08:18:38] <bot-t> (687 hours ago) <coldhead> tell falcom PUNNNNNNCH
[08:18:58] <falcom> the wrap function does half of what i want; and i'm not sure if there's an existing function doing what i want
[08:19:02] <ldleworker> Does anyone know of a working lazy loading technique for images?
[08:19:12] <twoface> falcom, $('<div>').append(elemA).append($('<div>'));
[08:21:10] <falcom> twoface: cool.. but what if elemA is already on the page? is there an efficient way to remove elemA and replace it with the wrapped elemA?
[08:21:54] <twoface> falcom, you should really just read the docs
[08:22:07] <twoface> ?replaceWith
[08:22:07] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[08:23:03] <falcom> thanks will look harder now
[08:25:26] <ldleworker> no one lazy loads their images?
[08:26:00] <johnline3> hey guys, i have a lot of elements that fadeIn() using jquery on my page, and to stop them flickering in on page load, i set their css to display:none;
[08:26:22] <johnline3> is there a better way? so that if the user doesnt have js enabled, content isnt hidden
[08:28:36] <polygon-pusher> is this correct formating for changing css rules $('div.newsletterContainer input[type="text"]').css("border:", "3px solid red");
[08:28:57] <Brodingo> remove the colon after border
[08:29:08] <polygon-pusher> oh dooo
[08:30:08] <johnline3> you can also use addClass and removeClass to swap in styles polygon-pusher
[08:30:44] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[08:30:55] <Brodingo> .css() should be a last resort method
[08:33:13] <falcom> johnline3: have your js code set the css of it to be display:none
[08:34:00] <falcom> johnline3: it isn't exactly pretty code but it's probably the only way to achieve what you want
[08:35:02] <ldleworker> Is there an idiomatic way to assign the value of one property to another?
[08:36:22] <johnline3> i was thinking falcom, should i try and execute the .css display:none; in a (document).ready?
[08:37:44] <twoface> obj.property = obj.another_property ?
[08:37:44] <falcom> if it's before ready i think it will be better
[08:38:08] <falcom> (only if it works)
[08:40:02] <falcom> johnline3: based on a quick skim on the documentation, .css set the "style" property, which might mean that  it wont work until document is ready
[08:40:41] <falcom> you can also have <noscript> <style> .blah { display:block; }
[08:40:59] <falcom> if setting css dynamically before document is ready wont work
[08:42:53] <johnline3> hmm true, thanks
[08:43:12] <johnline3> and yes, i found document needs to be ready to apply .css
[08:50:28] <NoNoNo> johnline3: with CSS: .js ELEMENT { display: none; } JS: $(function(){ $('HTML).addClass('js'); )});
[08:51:01] <enjoycrf> dang i screwd up my appetitae

[08:52:56] <johnline3> i am a little confused by those lines atm, but will study them

[09:14:36] <hariom> Cork: what is the difference in jquery dialog and modal window?
[09:14:46] <hariom> and what is content modal?
[09:16:34] <hariom> Is there any harm in designing entire subpage that has menus, buttons and size around 900X800 as a dialog instead of having it in window.open ?

[09:19:23] <orolo> i need to remove a dom element from one div and attach to another; is there a pattern for this?
[09:21:43] <quicksilver> orolo: just select it and append it to the other div
[09:21:51] <quicksilver> (it will vanish from the first automatically)
[09:22:49] <orolo> quicksilver: ok. no need to 'detach' then. cool thanks.
[09:23:17] <quicksilver> orolo: trivial example http://jsfiddle.net/XrLkD/

[10:02:15] <Brodingo> uhmmmm
[10:02:25] <imsky> thefalling: i can't think of a simple way, just the dumb long way
[10:02:32] <Brodingo> put it in an iframe
[10:02:35] <Brodingo> ?boom
[10:02:36] <bot-t> Did you are unimpressed? and now?

[10:02:41] <imsky> Brodingo: you are master of hacks
[10:03:58] <leroybuckingham> can i use var to scope a variable only to a loop?
[10:04:09] <imsky> noap
[10:04:11] <kborchers> leroybuckingham: no
[10:04:19] <leroybuckingham> thanks
[10:04:25] <imsky> that's kinda cool though
[10:15:22] <saml> hey, I'm doing this  var html = 'some html';  $(sel).append(html);     I want to add click handler for some elements in html.
[10:15:53] <saml> $(sel).append('...<a class="button">Remove</a>...')    I want to add .click()  to the Remove button
[10:16:40] <leroybuckingham> 12%5
[10:18:00] <kborchers> saml: there are multiple ways, just to a bind after the append or you can use live to bind to a handler to any a that is created with the button class if you want them all to act the same
[10:18:04] <kborchers> ?bind @ saml
[10:18:04] <bot-t> saml, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[10:18:08] <Brodingo> saml $(html).appendTo(sel).find(other).click
[10:18:09] <kborchers> ?live @ saml
[10:18:10] <bot-t> saml, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[10:18:49] <saml> i can't bind to .button because there are other elements
[10:19:34] <kborchers> so after you append .find(".button").click(....
[10:19:35] <saml> i want to bind click handler to the elements with .button class within the elements appended to $(sel)
[10:19:59] <saml> but if $(sel) already has .button..
[10:20:00] <t4nkd> How do I create an 'unless' type statement?
[10:20:15] <t4nkd> e.g. unless ($(this).hasClass('foo') { do.this(); }
[10:21:56] <saml> t4nkd, if (!$(this).hasClass('foo')) {  do stuff }
[10:22:00] <kborchers> t4nkd: if( $(this).not(".foo").length ) { do.this(); }
[10:22:15] <t4nkd> oh okay nice, Ididn't know you could bang like that
[10:22:18] <t4nkd> thanks saml
[10:22:34] <t4nkd> thanks also kborchers I like the idea of !$(this).function();
[10:26:02] <chucklarge> hey, using jquery template, i get this object when i render the template.  [<TextNode textContent="Chuck">, br, <TextNode textContent="Line 2">, br, <TextNode textContent="Line 3">]
[10:26:38] <chucklarge> i need to render that as html, but get null if i call var.html() .  only var.text() works, but strips the tags
[10:27:34] <saml> jQuery('body').append(jQuery('<a href="#">asdf</a>').click(function(){alert(1);}));
[10:27:35] <kborchers> saml: why not just do your binding before you append? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/b4zDv/
[10:27:36] <saml> this works
[10:27:51] <kborchers> heh
[10:27:59] <Jayflux> Does anyone know why my hovers are giving me errors in my boxes below?
[10:27:59] <Jayflux> http://goo.gl/PgNZM
[10:28:46] <Dave_Stein> Jayflux it says too much recursion which you could tell when the browser started to hang
[10:28:48] <imsky> Jayflux: your page froze firefox
[10:28:59] <imsky> i'm reading stuff man
[10:29:01] <Dave_Stein> Jayflux you must have a function calling itself or an infinite loop
[10:29:06] <Jayflux> hmm ok
[10:29:36] <saml> kborchers, what's event.preventDefault()?
[10:29:36] <Jayflux> i can't see where it would be infitatly looping
[10:29:58] <saml> oh event is function parameter. i thought you were using window.event
[10:30:06] <kborchers> that just prevents the click from following the href in that case
[10:30:09] <kborchers> right
[10:30:55] <webas> why some functions doesnt work if they are outside and linked to the html?
[10:31:14] <saml> kborchers, where is .preventDefault documented? is it jquery thingy?
[10:31:21] <kborchers> yes
[10:31:21] <t4nkd> ty again guys, appreciate the help very much
[10:31:26] <kborchers> ?preventDefault @ saml
[10:31:27] <bot-t> saml, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:31:36] <saml> oh right .click() is jquery
[10:31:38] <saml> haha
[10:32:49] <kborchers> saml: it's better to use that than something like return false; if you want to prevent the default action but still want the event to bubble
[10:33:08] <saml> i see
[10:37:50] <Deafgoose> why doesnt .after work using "this"  http://pastebin.com/97suuPGH
[10:40:22] <kborchers> Deafgoose: this is in the success callback's scope and does not refer to your button anymore. you will need to save "this" as another var outside of your getJSON then reference that new var inside your callback
[10:41:39] <Deafgoose> var myButton = $(this);	 ?
[10:41:50] <lahue> ajpiano: kborchers either of you around? :)
[10:42:03] <kborchers> lahue: maybe ;)
[10:42:16] <lahue> lol kborchers  one last ?
[10:42:21] <kborchers> sure
[10:42:39] <lahue> So in our dev we have the slider set to randomly select the image, anyway to set the jquery to work on any random number?
[10:42:51] <kborchers> Deafgoose: that would work
[10:42:52] <lahue> (Instead of just having the first be the default)
[10:42:58] <Deafgoose> http://pastebin.com/G0Txwxjs
[10:43:12] <Deafgoose> still not inserting the tag, what am I missing :p
[10:43:35] <Deafgoose> ouch, stupid mistake :)
[10:43:46] <Deafgoose> myButton.after('<span class="sbtitle">'+data[0]+'</span>') :-)
[10:44:04] <Deafgoose> hmm still didnt work
[10:45:29] <kborchers> lahue: you mean you want to start at a random num then sequential or jump around randomly?
[10:45:52] <lahue> Ex: we use <cfset Random = #RandRange(1, 5, "SHA1PRNG")#>
[10:46:13] <lahue> and then an if statement, if random EQ 1 then the first would be selected
[10:46:27] <lahue> but if the fourth it selected first, the first image is still FirstOver.jpg
[10:46:59] <kborchers> lahue: can you post the link to that fiddle again?
[10:47:31] <lahue> Let me see if I cant find it ;)
[10:48:11] <lahue> neg ill make a new one quick
[10:50:36] <simonandres> hi, I'm kinda young and new with the Json programing and decode so i need some help

[10:50:51] <simonandres> I'm trying to build a list from a json file
[10:51:03] <simonandres> I need some ideas, please

[10:51:16] <lahue> no, no kitties :( i ddint save that lol
[10:51:20] <kborchers> heh
[10:52:40] <kborchers> lahue: back in a min
[10:52:44] <lahue> kk ;)
[10:58:41] <austinbv> does anyone know of something like $.extend that works with multi tiered objects
[11:01:39] <hichs_> how handle multipul jquery
[11:01:46] <kborchers> lahue: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Q3Ey8/1/ This should eliminate the need for the server side randomization as well ... if i understood your earlier post. not a coldfusion expert
[11:02:32] <peol> austinbv: $.extend can extend deep, just prepend 'true' as first argument. $.extend(true, foo, bar, bad)
[11:03:47] <lahue> Hmm, no randomization :( or image changing
[11:03:55] <austinbv> peol: thanks
[11:04:28] <kborchers> lahue: really? let me put the kittens back in and look
[11:05:24] <lahue> hah ok, I remove my SS code, and now all the image are the first one ;)
[11:06:26] <|RicharD|> hi anybody know a good lightbox plugin for image
[11:06:37] <|RicharD|> that take the image from a div hidden ?
[11:07:08] <hichs_> how handle multiple jquery

[11:08:20] <|RicharD|> i already know colorbox...now i see better :)
[11:08:22] <|RicharD|> thx anyway
[11:08:49] <lahue> kborchers: the display order, as in the first image is always first is set by the server
[11:08:54] <lahue> I dont know if that makes a difference?
[11:09:32] <kborchers> lahue: not sure what you mean. this randomly selects the first image and then cycles through. is that not what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Q3Ey8/2/
[11:10:47] <lahue> Ok it randomly selects and cycles
[11:10:49] <|RicharD|> umh i read it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1428401/how-to-make-a-jquery-lightbox-open-multiple-images-from-one-link
[11:10:49] <hichs_> how to use noconflict ?????
[11:10:59] <|RicharD|> but how i can render all more dynamic ?it's for a cms
[11:11:03] <lahue> But for some reason ALL of the thumbnals are the same on my end
[11:11:20] <|RicharD|> so for any thumbnail i have many images hidden in a div
[11:11:23] <kborchers> lahue: did you clear your cache? ;)
[11:11:40] <lahue> yea, and ive tried diff browser
[11:12:05] <lahue> it is using the same main thumbnail and then one thumbnailover.jpg image
[11:12:40] <kborchers> hmmm
[11:13:09] <lahue> Yea :p
[11:13:12] <kborchers> and it wasn't doing that before?
[11:13:24] <lahue> no, it wasnt doing that until we added the random code
[11:14:28] <kborchers> lahue: what did you mean by "the display order, as in the first image is always first is set by the server"
[11:14:57] <lahue> All Image SRCs are set by the server, and then the display order as in 1-5 the first image on top is set by the server
[11:15:39] <lahue> Is there a way to tell your original code to select any random number?
[11:16:04] <kborchers> what do you mean? isn't that what i did?
[11:16:24] <lahue> Using my coldfusion
[11:16:57] <lahue> because my random and thumbnails work, but I just need the javascript to say "oh his random number is five, so I need to change the 5th thumbnail"
[11:17:41] <zoned> i'm using this code: http://pastebin.com/SnaAuwqV to do image rollovers on my page. what i would like to do is use either live() or delegate() to bind the event.. how can i use two functions like i have done if i'm using live/delegate ?
[11:18:13] <kborchers> like i said, not good with CF but if you can get that number over to the client side and just plug it in where i used the rand var, that would do it. then you can just remove my rand calculation
[11:19:09] <kborchers> lahue: and remove this line since it sounds like you are doing it with CF tabselem.tabs("select", rand);
[11:20:03] <kborchers> lahue: so your code would look like this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Q3Ey8/3/
[11:20:50] <kborchers> lahue: that number needs to be 0-3 though
[11:20:57] <kborchers> not 1-4
[11:21:56] <draginx1> Is there a way to listen to any DOMChange happening within #content for delegate?
[11:22:06] <lahue> omg that may have done it!
[11:22:15] <lahue> kborchers:  if there are 5 image?
[11:22:16] <lahue> 0-4
[11:22:26] <kborchers> yes
[11:22:27] <draginx1> Or anyway to execute a lot of javascript after every ajax call (worse case scenario if I have to dothis)
[11:23:19] <lahue> lol its workign with 1-5?
[11:23:20] <ngharo> draginx1: that's what the success callback is for
[11:23:31] <draginx1> ngharo: yeah but i need it for *every* ajax call
[11:23:41] <draginx1> its not like i have one single $.ajax() in my code lol
[11:23:46] <kborchers> lahue: if you get a 5 it may break
[11:23:49] <ngharo> ?ajaxSuccess @ draginx1
[11:23:53] <draginx1> on top of that id like that to be last case scenario as that it pretty intensive on the browser
[11:23:56] <draginx1> again last case scenario :)
[11:24:13] <draginx1> "Is there a way to listen to any DOMChange happening within irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#contentÂ for delegate?" more interested in knowing if there's a way to do this
[11:24:25] <nebbie> draginx1: r u from tp.bz?
[11:24:33] <draginx1> nebbie: yes, who are you? hah
[11:24:52] <draginx1> im banned on that irc server so i cant go back haha
[11:25:07] <nebbie> ahh ok.. I just recognize u from a while back.. so I had to ask.. I used to hang there, not anymore tho
[11:25:15] <nebbie> lol
[11:25:20] <draginx1> ahh cool, u got a girl? ;)
[11:25:26] <lahue> hmm ok, any explanation y?
[11:25:28] <nebbie> no
[11:25:38] <draginx1> all of that shit is bs man haha, once u ditch that shit girls will come ;)
[11:26:10] <kborchers> lahue: 0-4 are the indexes of the tab anchors. 5 would be a sixth tab that doesn't exist
[11:26:17] <nebbie> lol funny.. I still recall u all about the 'mode one'.. :)
[11:26:25] <lahue> sweet, i was able to tweak it to use 0-4 ;;)
[11:26:56] <lahue> And that was fast w/ animation
[11:27:09] <draginx1> nebbie: hah my style is actually very much inline with that :) I do that + act like a bear and just claw them/move them around etc ;)
[11:27:24] * kborchers cries for bot-t
[11:27:41] <kborchers> lahue: so you good to go?
[11:27:42] <lahue> kborchers: did you change any of the exisiting code or just append?
[11:27:56] <ngharo> draginx1: change event should bubble up the DOM so just attach your change handler to the parent and you're gold
[11:28:04] <nebbie> draginx1: r u doing some web development things now?
[11:28:40] <kborchers> yes, i changed setOver(tabs.anchors.first()); to setOver(tabs.anchors.eq(YOURNUMBERFROMCOLDFUSION));
[11:29:09] <draginx1> nebbie: yup I do mostly freelance, been doing a bit of consulting on the side but programming/software architecture has always been my main thing :) what about u?
[11:29:19] <draginx1> ngharo: what wold I bind it to?
[11:29:39] <draginx1> ' http://javascript.gakaa.com/domnodeinserted-description.aspx ' ?
[11:29:51] <ngharo> to the container
[11:29:58] <draginx1> i meant the event lol
[11:31:03] <nebbie> draginx1: trying to get a startup going, working on one currently..
[11:31:11] <lahue> ok I'm up and running on all of my options ;)
[11:31:19] <lahue> once again ty kborchers
[11:31:21] <draginx1> nebbie: nice :) What kind of start up if u dont mind me asking
[11:31:30] <kborchers> np ... time for lunch
[11:33:12] <nebbie> draginx1: the one I'm working on an web app that is nightclubs related.. it's only been about a month of development so far
[11:33:39] <draginx1> nice :)
[11:34:15] <razzi> does it pay well?
[11:35:33] <nebbie> pay = zero. the price of entrepeneurship.. obviously the hope is a great payout eventually
[11:35:52] <sgrover> Anyone know a good IRC channel for help with Canvas?
[11:37:14] <Brodingo> sgrover maybe #html5
[11:37:19] <sgrover> Or, what I'm trying to find is how I can draw a line behind a box.  I don't see any references to z-order.
[11:37:22] <sgrover> thanks Brodingo
[11:41:58] <orolo> for plugin development: what does this line do? var o = $.meta ? $.extend({}, opts, $this.data()) : opts;
[11:42:14] <StPiere> is there a way in jquery-ui.slider to trigger slide event  from outside ?
[11:42:45] <garbagegod> i have a bunch of functions that hide and show some divs but i want them to go on a timer so it executes 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 and back to 1

[12:06:34] <dotwired> why can't i work with the code i created via html() ?
[12:07:16] <Cork[home]> dotwired: work with?
[12:07:24] <Cork[home]> thats a text string
[12:07:38] <Cork[home]> if you want to use jquery on it you want dom objects
[12:08:57] <jeffsmykil> Is there some sort of version compatability tool that will tell me what im doing in my code that is not compatible with a specific version of jquery?
[12:11:58] <interlocutor> as long as you're using the latest version, your plugins should be compatible
[12:12:13] <interlocutor> afaik the core script doesn't remove functionality
[12:12:31] <jeffsmykil> well on our development server we have 1.4.1
[12:12:36] <jeffsmykil> the version included in .net
[12:12:46] <jeffsmykil> i accidentally developed this in 1.5.1
[12:13:06] <interlocutor> then you'll need to upgrade your development server.
[12:13:23] <interlocutor> there's no way to backport to the earlier version without a code audit
[12:13:47] <jeffsmykil> especially since i have no clue what i did differently
[12:14:02] <dotwired> Cork[home]: "interact"
[12:14:16] <interlocutor> I see, so you're looking for something that will tell you what you're using from 1.5 that's not in 1.4
[12:14:28] <educr0w> Hello, in $(document).ready, I attach some html to a div with $.post() function. How can I add event to an element that I've attached in that function? with $('#id') I can't do it :(
[12:14:36] <jeffsmykil> interlocutor: yes sir
[12:15:26] <interlocutor> I'm not personally aware of a tool like that, sorry...but I'm curious why you're not able/allowed to upgrade your development server version?
[12:16:36] <jeffsmykil> the only reason i can use jquery is because microsoft ships it with .net
[12:17:02] <jeffsmykil> our software runs in hospitals, they arent big on the whole open source thing
[12:17:22] <interlocutor> jquery is Microsofts AJAX platform of choice now
[12:17:31] <interlocutor> MS AJAX is deprecated
[12:17:43] <interlocutor> so, jQuery is now officially supported by MS
[12:17:47] <interlocutor> any version
[12:17:54] <jeffsmykil> maybe I can try and convince them
[12:17:58] <interlocutor> I sugest you upgrade your version for compatibility.
[12:18:10] <jeffsmykil> i think they think that because it shiped with asp its somehow less bug prone
[12:18:28] <interlocutor> here, show them this: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx
[12:18:39] <jeffsmykil> hrm its something that changed between 1.4.1 and 1.4.3
[12:19:32] <interlocutor> the bottom line here imo, is that you need to make your company understand that there is ZERO advantages to staying on an old version of jquery.
[12:19:44] <dotwired> hmm well seems to work in jsfiddle but i'm a little bit confusedabout my origin codeâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/WEKUV/
[12:20:23] <interlocutor> "We are really excited to be able to partner with the jQuery team on this.  jQuery is a fantastic library, and something we think can really benefit ASP.NET and ASP.NET AJAX developers.  We are looking forward to having it work great with Visual Studio and ASP.NET, and to help bring it to an even larger set of developers.
[12:20:23] <interlocutor> "
[12:20:40] <interlocutor> seriously though, just upgrade, even if you find the compatibility issue.
[12:21:45] <jeffsmykil> i know its going to come down to stability
[12:21:52] <jeffsmykil> and since i cant prove one way or another
[12:21:53] <jeffsmykil> i will lose
[12:22:00] <interlocutor> you're not opening up your app to bugs or security issues by upgrading, there's zero disadvantages
[12:22:15] <interlocutor> jquery isn't like that, there's not "stability" issue
[12:22:39] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/qYzdTYBK why dosent this work
[12:22:44] <interlocutor> it's a DOM manipulation script FFS, not some critical server side code
[12:23:01] <chrisdev> If I .load an HTML snippet with jquery, should I be able to reference the elements in that HTML? It seems I cant
[12:23:07] <garbagegod> god i hate javascript
[12:23:21] <interlocutor> either your function fires in the broser or not, it's not going to cause any issues beyond not working, and that's a problem easily solved
[12:23:30] <interlocutor> *browser
[12:23:45] <jeffsmykil> interlocutor: you know you have worked in a company like this
[12:23:59] <interlocutor> If your company doesn't understand the basics of jquery, you probably shouldn't use it at all
[12:24:05] <interlocutor> Oh indeed I have
[12:24:41] <interlocutor> they were a java shop for a long time, then moved to .NET.  Things just went downhill from there as they started to trust MS more than the developers
[12:24:55] <garbagegod> can anyone tell me why http://pastebin.com/qYzdTYBK dosent work
[12:25:07] <interlocutor> "Is that what Microsoft suggests?"
[12:25:09] <jeffsmykil> ok im going to try and convince them
[12:25:14] <jeffsmykil> wish me luck :-p
[12:25:22] <kborchers> garbagegod: you have multiple issues. first, var a = 0, (replace the , with a ;) second, you have an extra });
[12:25:30] <interlocutor> Alright, good luck, show them Scott Gu's blog about Jquesry
[12:25:38] <garbagegod> okay cool
[12:25:51] <garbagegod> there are multiple document ready function things in this script
[12:25:54] <garbagegod> this is just the last one
[12:26:33] <kborchers> garbagegod: still that comma will cause a syntax error. which firebug or chrome console would tell you
[12:26:52] <garbagegod> alright
[12:26:58] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/MaKjHLSt still dosent work :(
[12:28:05] <kborchers> garbagegod: start here http://eloquentjavascript.net/ then replace ;) after your var with just ;
[12:28:24] <garbagegod> alright
[12:28:28] <garbagegod> i just cant stand javascript
[12:28:35] <kborchers> why
[12:28:35] <garbagegod> i avoid it as much as possible
[12:28:38] <falcom> $(".some_class").click(function() {  $(this <stuff inside> ).show();   } ) .. how can i access the stuff inside .some_class
[12:28:55] <garbagegod> im a php coder and to me javascript just looks like someone banged their head on the keyboard a bunch to produce the code
[12:29:12] <garbagegod> which is probably pretty accurate in my experience
[12:29:33] <kborchers> wow, i don't think you'll get too much support in here on that one
[12:29:38] <garbagegod> haha
[12:30:30] <garbagegod> its just so unstructured and has so many obscure little vague things in its syntax
[12:30:40] <kborchers> like a ; ?
[12:31:05] <garbagegod> more along the lines of stuff like this and all the little functions it has
[12:31:37] <Rushing> javascript is very well structured. the problem is usually implementation
[12:32:00] <kborchers> "this" and scope may take some time to get your head around but still seems more logical to me than x->y->z
[12:32:07] <Rushing> it's been a very secondary language to most server-side programmers for so long that their code is usually just nasty
[12:32:39] <garbagegod> anyways http://pastebin.com/EJcStV8 still dosent work
[12:32:57] <garbagegod> honestly i think i could sit with a piece of javascript for 36 hours straight and not get anywhere with it
[12:33:03] <garbagegod> and i actually have before...
[12:33:07] <kborchers> link is broken
[12:33:21] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/EJcStV8k sorry
[12:33:33] <kborchers> garbagegod: sure, but someone who programs all day in JS and then looks at PHP could say the same thing
[12:33:50] <garbagegod> touche :P
[12:34:04] <garbagegod> let me show you what im trying to do...
[12:34:28] <kborchers> your problem is elsewhere as that code looks fine. other than using alert to debug
[12:35:02] * kborchers grabs more coffee, brb
[12:35:07] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/mjCU7Pbz
[12:35:16] <garbagegod> i just want all the stuff in the beginning to be timed
[12:35:36] <garbagegod> so like it will execute the click functions in reverse order
[12:36:17] <garbagegod> but only if someone hasnt clicked on it or something
[12:36:21] <garbagegod> this is such bullshit >:|
[12:36:58] <kborchers> garbagegod: all the stuff in the beginning? you mean the first 6 hides?
[12:37:41] <jeffsmykil> kborchers m having issues with formating json data to send to the server
[12:38:07] <garbagegod> nah i mean like i want to execute the b#t2 click function after like 5 seconds and then 5 seconds later the b#t3 and etc b#t4 clickfunction and back to 1 repeating
[12:38:25] <garbagegod> unless someone has actually clicked on one of them in which case i want it to stop..
[12:39:15] <markatto> I need to include a third party script that assumes jquery is available at the global variable $. Unfortunately, we already use prototype as $.

[12:41:04] <Guest5382> wat does this mean
[12:41:31] <markatto> kborchers: as far as I can tell, I can't use that. It is the third party code that relies on jquery being the global $, not our code.

[12:42:43] <mastermaw> hello all
[12:42:49] <mastermaw> i'm using $('id').remove(); to remove an area of html
[12:42:59] <mastermaw> and using a button to call the function
[12:43:11] <educr0w> Hello, in $(document).ready, I attach some html to a div with $.post() function. How can I add event to an element that I've attached in that function? with $('#id_of_element') I can't do it :(
[12:43:16] <kborchers> markatto: have you tried including it before you include prototype? just a guess
[12:43:21] <mastermaw> everything i want deleted is within <div id="49"> delete me! </div>
[12:43:25] <mastermaw> but! it doesn't work
[12:43:27] <Haprog> mastermaw: should be $('#id')
[12:43:39] <dotwired> ah okay. please help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/WEKUV/1/ if you're first adding a new li element and then want to delete it from the just created, it doesnt work
[12:43:44] <kborchers> garbagegod: what exactly is all of that doing?
[12:43:45] <Haprog> otherwise it looks for <id> not id="id"
[12:45:02] <garbagegod> kborchers: its kinda like a slieshow thing...
[12:45:07] <kborchers> garbagegod: if you start executing those clicks, nothing will happen after the first one because all of the slides have been hidden already. i guess those images will update but the hides won't do anything
[12:45:12] <garbagegod> you know, 4 sections one after the other...
[12:45:20] <deanclkclk_> anyone here?
[12:46:11] <geekbuntu> anyone know of a google-fonts based embedded editor?   well... not 'based' - but able to add/remove fonts - including typekit/google fonts?
[12:49:13] <mastermaw> i'm still struggling
[12:50:03] <mastermaw> my button works, and is calling my simple function
[12:50:09] <mastermaw> $('#id').remove();
[12:50:14] <educr0w> dotwired: you have the same problem like me, add event to dynamic content
[12:50:20] <Dave_Stein> mastermaw do you have a fiddle?
[12:51:01] <geekbuntu> mastermaw, you have a fiddle?
[12:51:01] <Dave_Stein> also it's not good practice for an ID to be a number because if you have two lists of items clearly you can't use id=5 twice
[12:51:10] <dotwired> educr0w: how you mean?
[12:51:37] <Dave_Stein> mastermaw $('#button').click( function() { $('#49').remove() }); is what youd want i think
[12:51:38] <mastermaw> if i pass it '70', should it not remove all html between <div id="70"> ...  </div ?
[12:52:28] <Dave_Stein> no it would remove 70
[12:52:29] <educr0w> dotwired: the first delet works, the others that appear when you click 'click me' doesn't works (are generated on the fly), I have the same problem
[12:53:12] <dotwired> educr0w: yes, this is the problem. but i didn't understand your solution, if you wanted to tell me a solution with the event thing
[12:53:32] <Dave_Stein> mastermaw it would remove that div and everything inside
[12:53:34] <educr0w> dotwired: I don't have solution, I just told you that I have the same problem :(
[12:53:44] <Dave_Stein> mastermaw to empty it out youd need to do: $('#70').html('');
[12:53:48] <educr0w> I here to know how to solve that issue
[12:56:23] <dotwired> educr0w: ah okay :D
[12:56:52] <Haprog> mastermaw: here's an example fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Haprog/4RNdb/

[12:59:05] <ravenzz> dotwired http://jsfiddle.net/WEKUV/3/
[12:59:06] <bambams> I'm trying to create a toggle button to lock a fieldset.
[12:59:31] <bambams> I have two problems (the second only applies to my example; heh...).
[12:59:53] <dotwired> ravenzz: damnit, i knew it :D i just thought to call the delete event again after creating :D http://jsfiddle.net/WEKUV/4/
[12:59:56] <bambams> Firstly, the toggle button doesn't always work reliably i.e., a click doesn't necessarily toggle it. Events seem to be missed or skipped.
[13:00:07] <bambams> The second problem is that my example isn't actually disabling the fields... >_<
[13:00:18] <bambams> http://jsfiddle.net/jLYmY/6/
[13:00:39] <dotwired> ravenzz: but your solution is much better of course, thank you very much!
[13:00:43] <bambams> By "lock" I actually just mean disable the client UI so the user doesn't accidentally change something.
[13:01:09] <ravenzz> dotwired live() Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future
[13:01:25] <dotwired> yep. thanks =)
[13:01:28] <ravenzz> you are welcome ;)
[13:01:53] <educr0w> ravenzz: I have slect that change, will work $('#id').live('change',function()) ?
[13:02:07] <webas> does it matter which jquery im using as long as its newest?
[13:02:34] <ravenzz> educr0w yes it should work
[13:03:03] <educr0w> ravenzz: excellent!! thanks :D
[13:03:17] <hooloovoo> bambams: what are you trying to do?
[13:03:24] <hooloovoo> bambams: lock the input fields?
[13:03:42] <hooloovoo> or just make the send button stop responding?
[13:04:57] <mastermaw> works - thanks Haprog
[13:05:03] <mastermaw> good old fiddle
[13:06:32] <BillCriswell> StackOverflow makes me sad
[13:06:49] <BillCriswell> Quality answers and people don't even acknowledge me. Damn internets.
[13:07:00] <sparuvu> hey guysâ€¦â€¦just a curious questionâ€¦..is it a good idea to call a javascript function inside a tmpl of jQuery templates ?
[13:07:23] <BillCriswell> inside a tmpl?
[13:07:48] <sparuvu> like â€¦..{{tmpl (myfunction("school")) '#jv-connections-template'}}
[13:08:20] <sparuvu> I am getting the desired output but not sure of performance
[13:10:27] <dotwired> another question regarding a similiar problem, but it's not binded with an event: if i used buttonset() jquery-ui widget (ord any other plugin) to an element and duplicate it it doesnt work in this duplicated element any more
[13:10:41] <bambams> hooloovoo: More or less disable the fields so they cannot be modified without the user explcitly "unlocking" them. :)
[13:10:56] <hooloovoo> bambams: mmh... okies
[13:11:13] <bambams> hooloovoo: The fields are used to automatically update some other fields (i.e., coordinates based on GMaps geolocation).
[13:11:39] <bambams> hooloovoo: However, the coordinates can also be explicitly set by the user. I don't want one to accidentally overwrite the other. The lock is meant to make it explicit.
[13:12:52] <bambams> I basically just want the 'lock' button to toggle reliably. :)
[13:13:35] <hooloovoo> bambams: hmm.... i've never locked a input field actually. don't even know if it's possible without hacks =P
[13:14:03] <bambams> hooloovoo: Well all I mean by "lock" is "disabled". :P   <input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
[13:14:32] <hooloovoo> ow!
[13:14:52] <ajpiano> bambams: use readonly instead of disabled ?
[13:15:10] <bambams> ajpiano: To what end? :\
[13:15:51] <ajpiano> oh you should also use prop() instead of .attr(),
[13:16:16] <ansimation> any idea why when i click the modal, it disappears but it's still there. it fades out but then have to click over a button again to get it remove() itself so that i can use other things.
[13:16:18] <ansimation> http://pastebin.com/WyaUk1Lv
[13:17:01] <amirite> kill self
[13:17:06] <bambams> ajpiano: I didn't even know about prop. :P That's new to me. Does 'attr' only retrieve the HTML attribute as opposed to the DOM property? :\
[13:17:18] <ajpiano> yes, new in 1.6.2
[13:17:20] <ajpiano> i mean 1.6
[13:17:26] <amirite> i mean 1.7
[13:17:39] <ajpiano> what's the deal with              var method = methods[locked|0];
[13:18:01] <amirite> what's the deal with              var method = methods[locked|1];
[13:18:05] <ajpiano> bambams: you could just do prop("disabled", true or false) instead of that nonsense
[13:18:22] <bambams> ajpiano: Well that is much nicer for sure. :)
[13:18:24] <amirite> bambams: you could just do prop("disabled", false or true) instead of that nonsense
[13:18:27] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: can I PM something to you, you can answer in here, I just dont want it out to everyone
[13:18:36] <bambams> Is amirite a bot or just a spammer? :P
[13:19:03] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: yes but don't expect me to have a response immediatley
[13:19:17] <hooloovoo> bambams: i'd listen to him cause he has a good point either way
[13:19:24] <jeffsmykil> WHY HAVENT YOU RESPONDED YET?!
[13:19:26] <jeffsmykil> :-p
[13:19:59] <bambams> hooloovoo: amirite just seems to be repeating what ajpiano says, but slightly differently or wrong. ;P
[13:20:07] <jeffsmykil> The question is, wtf am i doing wrong
[13:20:19] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: ^^^
[13:21:48] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: uh.... manually concatenating together a JSON string?
[13:21:52] <ajpiano> instad of using see ?stringify
[13:21:53] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[13:21:54] <ajpiano> is what you're doing wrong
[13:22:12] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: they arent forms and the such
[13:22:21] <jeffsmykil> they are passed via url parameters
[13:22:23] <ajpiano> you can cal JSON.stringify( onAnyObject);
[13:22:30] <bambams> I think I need more sleep. >_> This doesn't make any sense at all. disabled=true, but the field is not disabled?! Unless jsfiddle is faking the output wrongly...
[13:22:45] <ansimation> heh
[13:23:40] <bambams> Fixed (but still broken): http://jsfiddle.net/jLYmY/9/
[13:23:41] <ansimation> I'll be back in like 15 if anyone wants to review the paste i posted and tell me what i'm doing wrong
[13:23:58] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: for your convenience, i've put together this list of times when it's better to use manually concatenating strings together yourself to create JSON versus using JSON.stringify:
[13:24:06] <ajpiano> </end of list>
[13:24:10] <ansimation> haha
[13:24:14] <ansimation> +1
[13:24:21] <jeffsmykil> is that xml
[13:24:29] <jeffsmykil> im having trouble parsing it without a data type
[13:24:33] <bambams> +1
[13:24:49] <ajpiano> maybe
[13:25:54] <jeffsmykil> stringify isn't built into jquery?
[13:26:14] <ajpiano> no
[13:26:31] <jeffsmykil> yeah that's a problem then
[13:26:37] <jeffsmykil> so is it impossible to do it this way?
[13:26:41] <jeffsmykil> or just crazy?
[13:26:51] <ajpiano> it's really dumb
[13:27:14] <ajpiano> and here's the amount of effort i'm willing to expend looking for syntax errors in other people's manually concatenated together JSON strings
[13:27:16] <ajpiano> 0
[13:27:28] <jeffsmykil> thats an int Im guessing
[13:30:22] <sparuvu> can I pass the a function that returns an object as a parameter to the {{tmpl}} in jQuery templates ???
[13:37:18] <hooloovoo> anyone know if the jsonp format differs from json on the server side
[13:37:27] <hooloovoo> so i have to encode it differently somehow?
[13:39:24] <craq> im having a weird issue.. element.click() does not seem to happen on the iPad fora select box. im trying to toggle the native display.. anyone experience this?
[13:53:32] <gaspar|work> How do I select all the input fields with class .item_quantity and value > 0? It's a subset of $(".item_quantity"), I just don't know how to check for val() in selector
[13:59:50] <khmer> gaspar|work: you'll want to use .filter
[14:00:13] <khmer> $('.item_quantity').filter(function() { return this.val() > 0 });
[14:00:36] <khmer> wait, change this.val() to this.value
[14:04:12] <Unirgy> hi, can't make .select() work: http://jsfiddle.net/h3tkJ/ any ideas? thanks
[14:10:34] <geijutsuka> Hello... I have a question... errr, and please excuse my incompetence with javascript/jQuery in advance (learner). I have something of an image map... and depending over which area a user hovers, jQuery removes a visibility:hidden class on a particular image. I have eight different functions to do this with eight different areas. Is there a more efficient way to do this? here's one of the...
[14:10:36] <geijutsuka> ...functions: $('map #austocean').hover(function(){$('img.austocean').toggleClass('show-me')});
[14:12:28] <geijutsuka> the area has an id of "austocean" and the image has a class of "austocean" could I make what shows up there a variable of some type?
[14:13:15] <orolo> Unirgy: i pasted in the jQuery working example from the docs so at least you have a place to start: http://jsfiddle.net/h3tkJ/4/
[14:13:36] <orolo> do you need to work from an input element for it to work?
[14:14:09] <Unirgy> so it works only on input:text and textarea? not regular text?
[14:14:36] <orolo> ?select
[14:14:36] <bot-t> .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[14:15:29] <orolo> Unirgy: since 'select' is an action of a form element; i suppose it make sense.
[14:15:46] <Unirgy> ok i see that only IE supports it on all elements
[14:15:55] <Unirgy> will hack it with onmouseup
[14:15:56] <devinrolsen> hola Unirgy.
[14:16:02] <devinrolsen> weird to see you out of the magento room

[14:37:57] <thomedy> if i run the query $('#specificdiv').height()  that gets the heigh based on the content
[14:38:00] <thomedy> correct
[14:38:27] <Lurzino> I need a little little help.... I have this code: http://pastebin.com/RE2xZVYS where I have a href="" link.... I have a .js file with a .click() event and it should fire the alert message but it doesn't.... what I could have wrong or missed?.... thanks in advance to everyone!!!! :)
[14:38:28] <kbotnen> hi, Im trying to do a $j('#country option[value=""]').css("display","none"); which works fine in FF, but in IE it doesnt hide the field. It sets the property, but its still visible. Any easy way to achieve the same "effect" (hiding) that works in IE?
[14:38:28] <thomedy> i am using that number to animate a blog to that heigth and its not getting all the way down to the bottom
[14:41:09] <kbotnen> Lurzino, function(event)
[14:41:29] <kbotnen> you dont have the event part in the function paranthesis.
[14:42:20] <kbotnen> so I guess event.preventDefault doesnt fire.
[14:42:25] <Lundy> hi guys, how can I define a property in a button without it showing up in the value of it? is it like <button define[package]=1>Edit Package</button> ?
[14:42:32] <Lurzino> kbotnen, so I should remove the event and also the event.preventDefault() too?
[14:42:46] <kbotnen> no. you should write event inside the paranthesis.
[14:43:17] <kbotnen> that is, write the five letters that makes the word 'event' :)
[14:43:47] <Lundy> anyone?
[14:43:56] <Lurzino> ah... hold on
[14:43:58] <Lurzino> lemme try
[14:44:04] <kbotnen> http://pastebin.com/tZiW6qhD
[14:44:55] <Lurzino> yes I understand... I fixed and I'm trying right now if it works... hold on
[14:45:25] <Lurzino> yes it works
[14:45:31] <kbotnen> wuhu :)
[14:45:31] <Lurzino> thanks a lot kbotnen!!! :))))
[14:45:40] * Lurzino hands a fresh cold beer to kbotnen
[14:45:40] <thomedy> kokay im trying to animate a blog for someone and i have used the height() function to dynaicaly find the height nomater which blogis in front
[14:45:56] <thomedy> jquery docs say it gets the content height
[14:46:02] <thomedy> regardless of window
[14:46:05] <kbotnen> hehe.. np. Glad I could help.
[14:46:12] <thomedy> so i assumed it would get me to the bottom
[14:46:16] <thomedy> but it is not doing so
[14:46:41] <iammartian> hiya, i'm trying to bind an event to an element using a wildcard, like: $("input[name^=row?_QTY]").bind("keyup", someFunction);  << Is this possible?  I have a table full of elements that are generated by the server, and they look like: Row1_QTY, Row2_QTY, etc.
[14:46:52] <Lurzino> eh kbotnen... you see it was all the whole afternoon I was fighting with it! And just I had only to read better it was missing just 5 letters.... :D
[14:47:24] <janthony> Any idea why this won't fire $(".insert-offer-to-post").live("submit", function(){ console.log('test'); return false; });  - It's loading the new page instead of returning false, almost as if it didn't exist. Here is the form markup: <form method="post" action="#" class="insert-offer-to-post">
[14:47:51] <kbotnen> thats how you learn these kind of things ;) do you use firebug or IE developer toolbar? it would probably generated some kind of error on this one.
[14:48:30] <kbotnen> like. "event is not a variable" or "event is not defined", or similar.
[14:48:41] <Lurzino> you're right kbotnen... in fact my firebug is offline :P
[14:48:52] <Lurzino> now I'll switch on
[14:49:06] <kbotnen> hehe.. bring it up :) hard to debug without a debugger ;)
[14:50:21] <Lundy> anyone able to help?
[14:51:04] <draginx1> Anyone know how to trigger a $(obj).bind('dragstart') into a droppable on command?
[14:51:37] <orolo> Lundy:  i'm not sure i understand. but you can add properties <button my-awesome-property="true" value="something-else">
[14:53:22] <albertosheinfeld> Hello people!
[14:53:38] <janthony> Anyone?
[14:53:39] <albertosheinfeld> Is there a way to avoiid the cross-domain issue using jquery's $.post() method?
[14:53:50] <Lundy> so I could just do <button CP_id="3" id="edit_package" class="button"><img src="images/edit.png" border="0" width="15" height="15"></button>	
[14:54:09] <Lundy> now question... if I do a function like $('#edit_package').click(function(){
[14:54:18] <Lundy> how can I grab the CP_id?
[14:54:43] <Lundy> would it just be like $('CP_id').val() /
[14:55:31] <draginx1> $(this).attr('CP_id')
[14:55:35] <janthony> Lundy: throw the 3 into a supported <button> attribute then use .attr()
[14:55:51] <draginx1> ahh whats the other command for attr that supports non legit attributes?
[14:55:56] <draginx1> they just added it in 1.6 too..
[14:56:53] <albertosheinfeld> Is there a way to avoiid the cross-domain issue using jquery's $.post() method? anyone?
[14:57:34] <courpse> You mean to avoid security?
[14:57:57] <Lundy> ahhhhhhhhh :) thanks alot <3
[14:58:05] <albertosheinfeld> no... for example when you make an $.ajax it will give you that issue (in the console) unless you specify the jsonp dataType
[14:58:05] <jwmann> Is there a way to grab a specifc attribute of an element?
[14:58:21] <albertosheinfeld> but i can't get to avoid that using the $.post method
[14:58:28] <jwmann> like $this[id="foo"]
[14:58:32] <simoncpu> hi
[14:58:34] <janthony> Noone knows?
[14:58:37] <simoncpu> i have the same problem as this guy:
[14:58:39] <courpse> draginx1, Don't use non legit attributes?
[14:58:41] <simoncpu> http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=235979
[14:58:48] <simoncpu> how can i focus on an editable iframe?
[14:59:10] <courpse> draginx1, datasets are helpful if you need extra info in an element.
[15:00:45] <janthony> Does .submit() not work with .live() or something? I got .click() to work fine.
[15:01:12] <draginx1> courpse: its not my problem but someone elses :S
[15:01:31] <courpse> draginx1, Then copy/paste to someone else?
[15:01:49] <draginx1> ....what?
[15:02:46] <courpse> draginx1, Get your mouse, left click, drag it to the right tell you get to the end of the sentence, mIRC will auto clipboard it, others won't try Ctrl+c or rightclick/copy, then go to 'someone elses', and press ctrl+v, or right cliock and press paste.
[15:03:40] <draginx1> ur an idiot <3
[15:03:56] <courpse> draginx1, I thought you didn't understand the concept.
[15:04:06] <draginx1> Which is why my last statement holds truth
[15:04:18] <draginx1> The whole attribute question wasn't relevant to me
[15:04:19] <draginx1> end of story.
[15:04:31] <courpse> draginx1, Copy/paste the answer to who ever asked you.
[15:04:43] <janthony> Anyone?
[15:04:47] <courpse> oh.
[15:05:08] <courpse> I saw you ask a question about it.
[15:05:44] <ajpiano> janthony: what version of jquery
[15:05:46] <janthony> $(".insert-offer-to-post").live("click", function(){    // works $(".insert-offer-to-post").live("submit", function(){  // doesn't
[15:06:17] <draginx1> is insert-offer-to-post on a form?
[15:06:25] <draginx1> this seems more like a delegate task than a live one btw >.>
[15:07:00] <janthony> ajpiano: 1.6.1
[15:08:54] <janthony> ajpiano: Any ideas?
[15:09:04] <ajpiano> you should use 1.6.2 but that's besides the point
[15:09:34] <janthony> I don't get why .click would work but not .submit.
[15:09:52] <ajpiano> submit and change and focus don't bubble
[15:09:57] <ajpiano> jquery fixes that but in jquery 1.4 and above
[15:10:02] <ajpiano> so it shouldnt' be not-working
[15:10:33] <janthony> ajpiano: Yeah, I agree. That's why I'm frustrated. hehe. :)
[15:11:12] <janthony> Ahhh, found out why. This form is inside of another form.
[15:11:18] <ajpiano> glomp
[15:11:40] <janthony> It's for a WordPress meta box, but WordPress wraps the entire freaking page in a form, grrr.
[15:11:51] <ajpiano> pwned
[15:12:39] * geijutsuka sees that the room is a bit livlier than before so tries asking her question again
[15:12:55] <geijutsuka> I have something of an image map and depending over which area a user hovers, jQuery removes a visibility:hidden class on a particular image. I have eight different functions to do this with eight different areas. Is there a more efficient way to do this? here's one of the functions: $('map #austocean').hover(function(){$('img.austocean').toggleClass('show-me')});
[15:13:19] <geijutsuka> can anyone offer any help?
[15:13:22] <janthony> So much of using .serializeArray(). Guess I gotta do everything manually.
[15:13:29] <ajpiano> geijutsuka: yes
[15:13:34] <geijutsuka> :D
[15:13:41] <ajpiano> can you paste the live code at jsfiddle.net
[15:14:04] <geijutsuka> do I need an account first to paste it?
[15:14:08] <ajpiano> no
[15:14:23] <geijutsuka> k, lemme try, then
[15:14:25] <ajpiano> ps, if you want to give it a shot yourself
[15:14:52] <ajpiano> the trick to DRYING anything out is to keep the different parts in a data structure, and then encapsulate the functoinality in single function, and then iterate over the data structure calling the function on it.
[15:16:04] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky .....OOOGABOOGABOOGA
[15:16:04] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[15:16:38] <misterm> I generally just put my code under a hairdryer for 8 mins, but no longer...fire hazard
[15:17:17] <abjorn> I'm an air dry kind of guy
[15:17:20] <abjorn> I just let it sit around for awhile
[15:17:44] <geijutsuka> ajpiano: yeah... that's what I'm having trouble with... I don't know enough jQuery to do too much :( (trying to learn)
[15:17:59] <ajpiano> that's not really jquery, just javascript
[15:18:43] <abjorn> or just...general programming
[15:18:51] <ajpiano> that too :p
[15:19:01] <ajpiano> but post your stuff, i'll try to show you how to go about doing it
[15:19:16] <abjorn> he's just a giving kinda guy
[15:20:18] <geijutsuka> thank you :D ajpiano.. k, saving it
[15:20:51] <abjorn> fiddle that js!
[15:21:18] <geijutsuka> ajpiano: can you see it by going to jsfiddle.net/Lapt6 ?
[15:21:30] <ajpiano> yes
[15:21:59] <Brodingo> oh my
[15:22:13] <abjorn> brodingo!
[15:22:37] <Brodingo> abjorn!
[15:22:46] <albertosh> Is there a way to avoiid the cross-domain issue using jquery's $.post() method? anyone?
[15:22:49] <geijutsuka> I'm trying to become a better programmer, but the right side of my brain beats up the left side on a regular basis...
[15:23:09] <ajpiano> geijutsuka:  in this case you just have you realise that jQuery passes you a reference to the DOM element that the event is happening to
[15:23:15] <ajpiano> in the even thandler
[15:23:31] <Brodingo> that whole cross domain thingy
[15:23:43] <albertosh> yes???
[15:24:08] <Brodingo> i aint know expert but you need to do something with ports or jsonp
[15:24:10] <abjorn> not specifically using$.post
[15:24:21] <Brodingo> aint know
[15:24:35] <Brodingo> damnit brody what is wrong with you
[15:24:42] <abjorn> there's a lotta ways to get around it, albertosh
[15:24:44] <ajpiano> geijutsuka this should do the trick
[15:24:45] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/Lapt6/1/
[15:24:53] <ajpiano> or at the very least shed light on what the trick is
[15:25:01] <abjorn> http://alexsexton.com/?p=168
[15:25:01] <albertosh> how exactly abjorn?
[15:25:04] <abjorn> http://alexsexton.com/?p=168
[15:25:23] <albertosh> oh thanks!
[15:25:24] <ajpiano> geijutsuka: in addition, i suggest you read the following resources

[15:25:26] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[15:25:26] <albertosh> will take a look

[15:27:38] <ajpiano> good luck!!
[15:28:30] <geijutsuka> **GasP!* perfect!
[15:28:52] <geijutsuka> I could kiss you! thankyouthankyou!!
[15:29:24] * geijutsuka is convinced ajpiano is magic now
[15:29:27] <abjorn> I really hate CSS sometimes.
[15:29:31] <abjorn> And by sometimes I mean most times.
[15:29:32] <ajpiano> hhahaa
[15:30:17] <abjorn> I think it's a combination of magic and experience, geijustsuka
[15:30:26] <sgrover> Cookie help?  I can prove my document.cookie = ??? line is getting hit, but it refuses to set the cookie.  However, if I open up a console and manually do document.cookie = ??? it works fine.  Any suggestions?
[15:30:26] <abjorn> mostly magic tho
[15:30:32] <geijutsuka> yes, yes, this is true
[15:30:52] <abjorn> I don't think you cookie should be set to ??? :)
[15:31:06] * sgrover thinks ajpiano has the 'experience' thing down...
[15:31:28] <sgrover> abjorn: agreed.  That's why I'm actually setting values... the ??? was for discussion purposes only.  :)
[15:31:30] <geijutsuka> I make paintings... that type of mindset gets in the way of the programming part of my brain
[15:31:43] <abjorn> I know sgrover lol
[15:31:43] <ajpiano> are you really just setting document.cookie yourself or using like jquery cookie plugin
[15:32:36] <TeddyMurray> hi, $('.assign_date').datepicker({ ampm: true });
[15:32:39] <sgrover> ajpiano: literall "document.cookie = 'test=test';"  - no joy in code.  same line in console works fine.
[15:32:47] <TeddyMurray> will this make all my .assign_date's have a datepicker?
[15:32:48] <TeddyMurray> or only 1?
[15:33:12] <sgrover> hmm... actually now that I think of it, I'm doing document.cookie = 'myvar=' + JSON.stringify(someobject); in my code.
[15:33:49] <TeddyMurray> =[
[15:33:54] <ajpiano> sgrover: i'd strongly recommend using a cookie api of some sort
[15:34:42] <TeddyMurray> or should i use .each() ?
[15:34:53] <sgrover> understood.  I'm building a largish plugin though and was hoping to avoid a dependancy...  I need a simple set/get cookie for session length only...
[15:35:13] <sgrover> http://pastie.org/2462425 - tried with and without escaping.
[15:37:09] <sgrover> I'm testing in chrome that has some known issues with cookies on the localhost.  I've set up a virtual host though and can set cookies, except with that code....
[15:37:23] <TeddyMurray> im having trouble adding a datepicker() to a dynamically added element
[15:37:30] <ajpiano> sgrover: cookie need to have expiration dates and such
[15:37:35] <ajpiano> you're not setting that at all
[15:37:45] <ajpiano> who knows if the console has some magic juju for doing it automatically
[15:37:53] <snover> ajpiano: session cookies have no expiry
[15:37:59] <sgrover> if no expiration or path, then it defaults to session, and the current server.

[15:38:22] <AfroTurf> if i have options = { success: function(r) {} } how do i run this with the response
[15:38:34] <AfroTurf> options.success(r) doesn't work
[15:42:13] <jdevel> AfroTurf, your issue is with scopre
[15:42:16] <jdevel> scope*
[15:42:29] <AfroTurf> ok.. what shoudl i do
[15:42:37] <jdevel> get a var within scope and set it from the function
[15:44:30] <sgrover> TeddyMurray: your code would apply to ALL objects with the class .assign_date at the time the code was run.  If you add objects to the page after that, you'll have to run the code again.
[15:45:06] <AfroTurf> jdevel: sorry i'm new to this, could you give me a quick example
[15:45:40] <conee> anyone know if there's any event that fires on click of a jquery ui tab even if it's the currently displayed one?  the select event only fires if the tab selected is not currently active.
[15:45:45] <sgrover> AfroTurf: a pastie of your code would be handy.  It' *may* be a scope problem like jdevel suggests.
[15:45:51] <TeddyMurray> sgrover, i see
[15:45:51] <TeddyMurray> thank you
[15:46:01] <AfroTurf> sgrover: 1 sec
[15:46:29] <sgrover> conee: tabs are based on list items.  so something like $('div.tabs li').click(...) would do the trick.
[15:47:24] <conee> sgrover: yeah i was sorta hoping i didn't have to add my own bindings...i hate having my own custom code bound to elements that jquery is already managing.
[15:47:27] <sgrover> you can even do something like $('div.tabs').tabs('...') to execute one of the plugin methods to determine which tab is selected, etc
[15:47:47] <AfroTurf> sgrover: http://jsfiddle.net/cy38P/
[15:48:30] <conee> sgrover: do you happen to know what order things would execute in if i bound something to the click event on a tab?
[15:49:11] <conee> given the fact that jquery has callbacks bound to the tab already, where in the flow of things would my handler happen?
[15:50:06] <sgrover> conee: sry, no idea.  Probably in the order they were applied though.
[15:50:09] <dmarkey> more of a JS question, If im defining a function in another function(which is pretty normal), how does one pass a variable into the function (without passing as a parameter)
[15:50:43] <conee> sgrover: hm...figuring out which callbacks happen when is going to be fun.  thanks for the input though, looks like i'll have to do it manually
[15:50:47] <ajpiano> you just access it, the nested function can access any variables that are private to the function in which it's defined
[15:50:50] <ajpiano> dmarkey
[15:51:06] <sgrover> AfroTurf: try doing a console.log(options.success) inside your _success function.  If you don't see a function definition, then you might see a hint of what's going on.
[15:51:20] <AfroTurf> sgrover: ok thanks
[15:51:49] <philosophically> i am using a gallery where the images are loaded by javascript... php builds the page and the javascript... now i am trying to make an ajax cal to the page and load it dynamically and i cant grab the js. is there any way i can do that? pass the javascript through somehow?
[15:53:10] <nohorse___> when i launch my page via a window.open() my listviews are no linger clickable.  is this a known issue?
[15:54:16] <AfroTurf> sgrover: _success will not fire
[15:54:24] <AfroTurf> do i need _success()
[15:54:29] <dmarkey> ajpiano: got it, thanks
[15:55:07] <sgrover> AfroTurf: I suggest you track down that problem first then... :)
[15:55:15] <AfroTurf> k
[15:55:17] <AfroTurf> thanks
[15:55:25] <sgrover> I haven't used ajaxToken, so can't offer any insights there...
[15:55:51] <PhonicUK> I'm having a case of .toggleClass being weird - if I have two divs, one with classes A B C, and another A C, I can toggleClass('C') on the latter class, but not the first one
[15:56:04] <PhonicUK> A B C just being examples, they're not actually called that
[15:56:49] <fission6> anyone have a nice form word count solution to lock the form after a limit is reached?
[15:57:14] <jdevel> just do a split on a space character and check the length..
[15:57:32] <jdevel> that will be a easy crude word count..
[15:58:03] <jdevel> if x=y form.element.disabled = true
[15:58:21] <jdevel> basic idea of it..
[15:59:10] <uchuff> that sounds weird PhonicUK, if noone else can help from just that (I can't!) might be worth pasting a snippet somewhere
[15:59:32] <PhonicUK> i think something is being weird, these are dynamically created objects
[15:59:37] <PhonicUK> and the click event is being fired multiple times...
[15:59:54] <PhonicUK> i moved the toggle to an onclick= on each dynamic object, works fine now
[15:59:55] <PhonicUK> ah well
[16:02:20] <Tcalp> does anyone know of a dynamic form field plugin that supports initial data sets and supports arrays for naming of fields ?
[16:07:12] <osoba> Hi, could somebody enlighten me as to what the hell is wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/g4TzH/ :P I am new to JSON so I have no clue why isnt it alerting anything
[16:11:44] <draginx1> osoba: i believe ur json is invalid
[16:12:04] <draginx1> remove ";" :)
[16:12:10] <osoba> at the end?
[16:12:40] <draginx1> hmm json lint said that was an error
[16:12:42] <draginx1> but its not O_o
[16:12:44] <draginx1> http://jsonlint.com/
[16:12:53] <osoba> still doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/g4TzH/1/
[16:14:21] <ansimation>  here's the code: http://pastebin.com/WyaUk1Lv , here's what should be happening: click button and dialog appears with dynamically created modal. modal gets clicked, dialog and modal disappear. now on to the problem: everything works as described, but after the modal disappears if you hover over a button or use firebug, it shows the modal still being there. clicking it one more time makes it work as it should. but it should do that without requi
[16:14:21] <ansimation> ring the second click
[16:14:31] <draginx1> osoba: i dont tihnk u can pass a variable into it O_o
[16:14:33] <draginx1> it *has* to be a string
[16:15:04] <osoba> ooooooh
[16:15:16] <osoba> the entire {} needs to be inside '{}' _
[16:15:17] <osoba> the entire {} needs to be inside '{}' ?
[16:15:24] <sanjayb> I have a question: I call $.get() with some data parameters that it uses to construct a URL to make a request. Is there any way to get the value of that URL as a variable without doing string concatenation and creating the url myself?
[16:16:16] <draginx1> http://jsfiddle.net/g4TzH/3/ <â€” osoba
[16:16:34] <draginx1> sanjayb: like a url: $(this).attr('href') ?
[16:16:43] <sanjayb> draginx1, no.
[16:16:46] <draginx1> osoba: also notice all on one line :)
[16:16:54] <osoba> yeah got it, thanks draginx1 :)
[16:17:06] <osoba> yeah i know strings cant go on multiple lines
[16:17:08] <osoba> but hmm
[16:17:16] <osoba> a client should be filling in json data
[16:17:33] <osoba> its data for all usa states... it will be messy all in one line :/
[16:17:41] <sanjayb> draginx1, like: I do $.get("foo.php", {'x': 1, 'y': 2', 'z': 3'}, function(foo) {}); ... now jquery calls a url like foo.php?x=1&y=2&z=3 ... I want to get that url value in a variable.
[16:17:41] <ajpiano> handwriting json is really bad idea
[16:17:56] <snover> extreme levels of badness
[16:17:56] <ajpiano> forcing users/clients to handwrite json is even worse"
[16:18:26] <osoba> its a tech savvy client :P
[16:18:28] <sanjayb> the only thing worse than forcing users / clients to write json, is forcing them to write xml ;)
[16:18:32] <sanjayb> osoba, thats no excuse.
[16:18:40] <sanjayb> osoba, and, thats what they all say :P
[16:18:43] <osoba> and he will be filling in data once and never change it :P
[16:19:01] <draginx1> sanjayb: you ight have to pass xhr object
[16:19:15] <sanjayb> draginx1, ah! let me look into that! cheers:)
[16:19:19] <educr0w> osoba: 'some string' + enter.. 'continue strin' + enter 'finish string';
[16:19:34] <osoba> oki
[16:19:36] <osoba> thanks
[16:19:38] <ansimation> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6RyEmDyJM - a screen cast of what's happening
[16:19:40] <draginx1> sanjayb: yup :) sorry I dont know the sepcifics offhand, console.log world u go! :)
[16:20:30] <sanjayb> draginx1, sure - just needed the hint.. thanks.
[16:20:35] <educr0w> osoba: http://jsfiddle.net/g4TzH/4/ like this
[16:20:50] <osoba> yep thanks
[16:20:59] <educr0w> :)
[16:22:07] <pandeiro> is there a way to unbind all of the events bound to the children of an element?
[16:22:58] <sanjayb> argh, this object that is returned with var foo = getJSON( ... ) .. has all sorts of nice methods, but not the damned url of the page it is fetching. Guess I will have to do string concatenation to create the url. argh.
[16:23:23] <sanjayb> pandeiro: $(elem).children().unbind("event_type")  ?
[16:23:49] * ansimation yawns
[16:24:11] <draginx1> educr0w: couldnt you technically just do backticks?
[16:24:37] <draginx1> osoba: http://jsfiddle.net/g4TzH/5/ :)
[16:24:51] <draginx1> less typing makes jack a happy boy o-o
[16:28:52] <educr0w> draginx1: nice! I didn't know that, thanks!! I know something new :D

[16:37:07] <garbagegod> hey guys i have this line:     for (var i in json['data']) {
[16:37:07] <garbagegod>                         $('#wholesaleitems').append("<div id='" + json['data'][i]['id'] + "' itemno='" + json['data'][i]['itemno'] + "' added='" +
[16:37:07] <garbagegod> json['data'][i]['added'] + "' desc='" + json['data'][i]['description'] + "' price='" + json['data'][i]['price'] + "' style='background-position:center
[16:37:07] <garbagegod> bottom; background:
[16:37:07] <garbagegod> url(" + json['data'][i]['image'] +");'></div>");
[16:37:07] <garbagegod>                         document.write(" + json['data'][i]['price'] +");
[16:37:08] <garbagegod>               }
[16:37:14] <garbagegod> sorry about that paste i didnt mean to do that
[16:37:55] <garbagegod> anyways how do i change the src of that background image from that shitty + json['data'][i]['image'] + to something else
[16:38:16] <garbagegod> ive tried everything i cant even get it to show me what the src actually is and its really pissing me off
[16:39:29] <draginx1> itll change to whatever json[data][i][image] is
[16:39:33] <draginx1> u need to change it through there
[16:40:26] <Tcalp> does anyone know of a dynamic form field plugin that supports initial data sets and supports arrays for naming of fields ?
[16:40:43] <garbagegod> draginx1: no matter what i change it to it dosent work
[16:40:48] <RobertV> if i need to do calculations with values like '10px' does jquery have a mechanism to do that?
[16:40:52] <garbagegod> if i change it to an image url it dosent work
[16:41:03] <draginx1> yeah idk if browsers respond in that way for css
[16:41:03] <garbagegod> i dont even know what the value is and id like to
[16:41:05] <draginx1> they should O_o
[16:41:15] <draginx1> well then i dont think anyone can *really* answer ur question :S
[16:41:18] <garbagegod> :(
[16:41:40] <garbagegod> this whole thing sucks
[16:41:57] <garbagegod> i hate json and i hate javascript and jquery and everything
[16:42:00] <garbagegod> all of them suck so much
[16:42:01] <coldhead> aw don't despair brother
[16:42:14] <coldhead> it's not that those things suck and other things don't
[16:42:18] <coldhead> everything sucks
[16:42:26] <garbagegod> is there a way to see what the value of that is then
[16:42:52] <garbagegod> ive tried document.write(" + json['data'][i]['image'] + "); but it just outputs that string of text
[16:43:34] <coldhead> console.log(json) ?
[16:43:40] <garbagegod> and i dont even get how that works...
[16:43:49] <garbagegod> im more looking for a way to see the path its outputting
[16:43:59] <garbagegod> like from the way the code works i know its outputting an image url
[16:44:03] <fission6> hey there, i need a light solution that expands a div or something to that affect when a user clicks "reply" to a update post, any ideas? something similar to twitter/fb
[16:44:04] <garbagegod> but i cant tell what the image url is
[16:44:27] <garbagegod> or anything
[16:44:38] <coldhead> do you have google chrome, garbagegod ?
[16:44:44] <garbagegod> yeah
[16:44:55] <coldhead> can you open the javascript console?
[16:45:02] <garbagegod> ill try
[16:47:24] <garbagegod> wtf it dosent even work at all in chrome
[16:47:38] <garbagegod> god damn it
[16:48:37] <coldhead> that's very odd
[16:48:43] <coldhead> chrome is usually very tolerant
[16:51:37] <garbagegod> 1how do i open the javascript debugger
[16:51:47] <garbagegod>  /console in chrome
[16:52:25] <garbagegod> ?
[16:52:56] <garbagegod> i think i got it open now what do i do
[16:53:21] <coldhead> try typing console.log(json)
[16:53:28] <coldhead> at the field in the bottom
[16:53:33] <coldhead> and uh hit ENTER
[16:53:36] <coldhead> or Return
[16:54:02] <coldhead> allah willing you'll be able to click and explore exactly what that json variable contains
[16:54:04] <garbagegod> reference error
[16:54:12] <coldhead> okay so json isn't defined at that point
[16:54:24] <coldhead> so you'll have to add that line in your code
[16:54:28] <coldhead> and reload the page with the console open
[16:54:30] <garbagegod> okay
[16:54:43] <coldhead> so put console.log(json) at a point in your code where json should exist
[16:54:51] <coldhead> i'm praying for you, bro
[16:54:56] <coldhead> you and michelle bachman
[16:55:16] <khaan> hi everybody - can anyone point me out to a jquery technique / wordpress plugin to make vertical smooth scroll with easing from a fixed menu? :)

[16:57:22] <garbagegod> i dunno
[16:57:28] <garbagegod> the page im trying this on is full of json bullshit
[16:57:34] <garbagegod> thats where i got that line im trying to change from

[17:27:27] <r1ch_> });
[17:28:47] <ajpiano> class isn't a property of a jquery object
[17:28:51] <ajpiano> do .attr("clasS")
[17:28:55] <ajpiano> class*
[17:29:07] <imsky> man
[17:29:10] <imsky> what if it was!
[17:30:15] <r1ch_> ajpiano: sorry missed that! still doenst work though. i think the traversing inside the live function is more the issue
[17:30:26] <imsky> that's not an issue at all
[17:30:32] <ajpiano> traversing in live handler should work fine, assuming the handler is being fired
[17:31:17] <r1ch_> ajpiano: its definitely being fired just can't figure out why this isn't fetching the class
[17:31:42] <ajpiano> i can't really do much unles i see it failing myself
[17:32:03] <r1ch_> ajpiano: will jsfiddle it one min
[17:36:11] <Lundy> hi guys, anyone know how I can get the "hide menu" div to move right over to the left when the menu is hidden? http://jsfiddle.net/WeUM6/
[17:36:40] <r1ch_> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/zU7cG/
[17:38:17] <imsky> Lundy: lol what
[17:38:27] <ajpiano> r1ch_: that's a bad traversal to do
[17:39:01] <ajpiano> .next(".name option:selected")
[17:39:06] <ajpiano> cause all it does is grab the next element
[17:39:12] <ajpiano> and then check if it matches that selector
[17:39:17] <ajpiano> which it clearly won't
[17:39:36] <jdevel> what's the best short hand way in jquery to create a new element?
[17:39:49] <ajpiano> $("<div>")
[17:39:51] <jdevel> anything like $$('div')
[17:40:01] <snover> Iâ€™m pretty sure there is only one shorthand way in jquery to create a new element
[17:40:01] <jdevel> k
[17:40:04] <ajpiano> $("<div>", {id: "foo"});
[17:40:10] <r1ch_> ajpiano: what would be the best way to grab the value of .name then?
[17:40:13] <jdevel> brilliant
[17:40:18] <jdevel> thanks aj
[17:40:31] <Lundy> imsky: what im trying to do is when you click on Hide menu... it will toggle #staff_bg... and move the hide menu over to the left hand side of teh screen
[17:40:54] <ajpiano> r1ch_: $(this).closest("tr").find("select.name").val();
[17:41:41] <r1ch_> ajpiano: thank you!!
[17:42:44] <jdevel> ajpiano, if I load elements from a selector from within another element, then remove those will that destroy the ones pulled with the selector?  I guess what I'm wondering is.. is the collection of elements returned a reference only?
[17:42:48] <imsky> Lundy: yeah, well you want to change some CSS with that
[17:43:20] <ajpiano> jdevel: a great number of jquery methods return a new collection
[17:43:22] <ajpiano> so if i do
[17:43:36] <Lundy> stumped
[17:43:39] <ajpiano> var foo = $(".foo");  and then foo.filter(".bar");  foo will not be changed.
[17:43:52] <ajpiano> only if i do foo  = foo.filter(".bar");
[17:44:22] <jdevel> k, so if I grab all the divs, anchors, and images from withing element A, then clear element A everything in my var should not be effected
[17:45:04] <ajpiano> well if you have a reference to that element, you won't magically have a reference to it with it's OLD contents
[17:45:13] <imsky> Lundy: you'll need to use ?css
[17:45:14] <bot-t> Lundy, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[17:46:47] <jdevel> right, what I'm talking about is var a = $('elemA').find('>dev,>a,>img'); $('elemA').empty(); a should still have all the elements pulled with the selector
[17:47:58] <jdevel> I'm just running some things in my head.. I suppose I could just test this rather than talking about it
[17:48:40] <ajpiano> jdevel:  yeah
[17:49:12] <jdevel> Thank you for talking that one over with me.
[17:49:32] <jaequery> hi
[17:49:44] <jdevel> hola
[17:49:45] <jaequery> what sets apart a good front-end developer to a great front-end developer?
[17:49:55] <jdevel> code
[17:50:03] <jaequery> can you more in details
[17:50:16] <jdevel> experience
[17:50:19] <jdevel> takes time
[17:51:30] <jdevel> if you have only been at it for a year or 2, chances are someone doing it for 5 will be better..
[17:51:48] <jdevel> however, not in every case.
[17:53:32] <jdevel> i've been developing for about 11 years now..
[17:53:45] <jaequery> and so have i
[17:53:55] <jaequery> but what will decide who is better, you or me
[17:53:56] <jdevel> not counting learning time
[17:54:15] <jdevel> well that all depends
[17:54:18] <jaequery> lol
[17:54:20] <jaequery> exactly
[17:54:21] <jdevel> how versed are you in security
[17:54:36] <jaequery> security, in front-end?
[17:54:50] <jdevel> how many server side languages do you know, how many regular programming languages, how many platforms..
[17:54:54] <jdevel> sure
[17:55:01] <jdevel> if you are using cookies etc.
[17:55:06] <jdevel> and don't implement proper
[17:55:10] <jdevel> or use for authentication
[17:55:19] <jdevel> you can be vulnerable
[17:55:32] <jaequery> do you prototype?
[17:55:34] <jdevel> i guess I'm a font-end and back-end, and then some
[17:55:46] <jdevel> the framework or extension of objects?
[17:55:54] <jaequery> the extension
[17:55:57] <jdevel> indeed
[17:56:04] <jdevel> written my own animation library
[17:56:30] <jaequery> is prototyping a must when you develop?
[17:56:40] <jdevel> depends on what you want to accomplish
[17:56:54] <jdevel> sometimes you might want a new method on an array
[17:56:58] <jdevel> then it's helpful
[17:57:13] <jdevel> but people often over use or use it when it isn't needed
[17:57:21] <jdevel> just like ajax
[17:57:22] <jaequery> for me, i feel prototyping can make things more confusing, since you are breaking out of the normal structure
[17:57:45] <jdevel> not if your familiar with it
[17:57:49] <jdevel> then you just read the code.
[17:57:51] <jaequery> i think proper namespacing your classes is better than prototyping
[17:58:05] <jdevel> well there are not real classes in js
[17:58:07] <jaequery> because, atleast you'll know where it's being called/assigned from
[17:58:28] <jaequery> like, if i have, tools = {}, i know where all the tools.* live
[17:59:15] <jaequery> but when you start prototyping , it's harder to pin point how/where it got set, especially in multi-team development
[17:59:27] <jaequery> do you agree?
[17:59:55] <jdevel> not entirely
[18:00:07] <jdevel> that is why you use comments
[18:00:23] <jdevel> especially in multi-developer environments
[18:01:56] <jaequery> well, comments/docs can't be answer to all things
[18:02:24] <jaequery> im asking this because theres this new guy on our company going crazy over prototyping almost every single thing
[18:02:50] <jaequery> im trying to figure out, if he is doing this because he is really good, or if he is a noob going crazy over it for the first time
[18:02:56] <ajpiano> the idea that these two approaches are somehow mutally exclusive....
[18:03:54] <imsky> they are
[18:04:18] <jaequery> what is mutually exclusive
[18:04:54] <ajpiano> not these two things
[18:05:26] <Tcalp> when cloning a texteara how do I duplicate it without a value / text content ?
[18:05:28] <ajpiano> jaequery: it really depends on a lot
[18:05:29] <imsky> a really good noob going ham on prototyping?
[18:06:04] <ajpiano> do you mean he's "prototyping" by like, creating meaningful, reusable constructors and prototype properties and methods?
[18:06:33] <ajpiano> or that he's like, extending a shit load of shit onto native object prototypes
[18:07:20] <b1lly> so who won the pissing contest?
[18:07:56] <ajpiano> the toilet
[18:08:16] <imsky> damn that toilet
[18:10:02] <ace_me> how could be the easiest way to get a array with the days from today until the end of the month ? I want to pass them to calendar picker... ?
[18:11:22] <jaequery> i think problem is i was doing everything from from my util object (which is collection of my finest snippets simple things like ucfirst(), shuffle(), datetounix(), etc...   now he is loading it all into prototype
[18:12:04] <jaequery> and im thinking, whats the point
[18:12:30] <ridethefire122> Hey dudes. Any idea why this jquery function is broken? http://pastebin.com/L2NAqUwf
[18:14:30] <imsky> is this drupal?
[18:14:32] <courpse> ridethefire122, Because its using <marquee>
[18:15:16] <ridethefire122> imsky it's part of a drupal plugin that I developed, but it isn't "drupal" specific
[18:15:35] <ajpiano> ridethefire122: regardless of whether marquee with inline event handlers specifically will work
[18:15:38] <ajpiano> (i have my doubts)
[18:15:43] <ajpiano> this is *not* how you wrap something in jQuery
[18:15:47] <ajpiano> javascript thinks in terms of elements
[18:15:48] <ajpiano> not strings
[18:15:56] <ajpiano> so you don't prepend the opening tag and then append the closing tag
[18:16:00] <ajpiano> you have to use see ?wrap
[18:16:00] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[18:16:03] <ajpiano> or one of the other wrapping methods
[18:16:46] <ajpiano> and now i legit have to take a shower
[18:21:27] <thomedy> i want to build a recursive funcion using animate({}) and did that the traditional recursive function the way i know how
[18:21:44] <thomedy> but i m told that the stack gets its nuts flicked when you do that
[18:22:05] <thomedy> so now im using a call back function but its not working
[18:22:11] <thomedy> will that work
[18:22:20] <thomedy>  so taht i can use a call back recursively
[18:22:54] <IgnisDiabolus> hey. anybody know of a better plugin like oembed?
[18:24:42] <jdevel> thomedy, will setInterval work?
[18:25:39] <jdevel> rather than using a recursive func call
[18:26:01] <jdevel> or would that result in a scope issue?
[18:27:11] <snover> ?g setinterval harmful
[18:27:12] <bot-t> snover, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[18:27:39] <jdevel> guess I'll have to read that
[18:27:46] <jdevel> I haven't had any issues using it..
[18:29:23] <jdevel> eh.. just someone's opinion
[18:29:51] <jdevel> just write sound code..
[18:29:54] <jdevel> ;)
[18:30:50] <jdevel> there is a reason it exists...
[18:33:35] <snover> there is a reason typeof null == "object" too, doesnâ€™t mean it is correct or should be used
[18:36:50] <jdevel> i agree, however setInterval isn't incorrect.
[18:37:03] <snover> it is a bad idea to use it.
[18:37:10] <xp_prg> is anyone aware of a lightbox type gallery solution that can be configured with a single link that like reads a directory of images to show?
[18:37:10] <jdevel> you should be handling your errors anyhow
[18:37:22] <snover> that solved about 1/3rd of the issues that setInterval has.
[18:38:09] <philosophically> is there a way that i can print the url in the address bar without going to it?
[18:38:26] <jdevel> ajax handles the wait.. drop an animated gif on the screen while you wait
[18:38:36] <imsky> or a canvas loader
[18:38:45] <jdevel> indeed
[18:38:49] <snover> philosophically: that would violate so many security conventions.
[18:39:03] <chamon83> hello everybody!
[18:39:06] <imsky> hello there
[18:39:10] <philosophically> snover: hah ok, just checking
[18:39:12] <snover> â€œno really this page is paypal.com, lol, please send ur loginsâ€
[18:39:14] <jdevel> I've been using setinterval for a long while and my scripts haven't run into the mentioned issues
[18:39:17] <imsky> money pl0x
[18:39:22] <chamon83> i'm looking for help somebody can help me?
[18:39:29] <snover> jdevel: that you know of.
[18:39:29] <imsky> chamon83: i can help you with your wildest requests
[18:39:36] <imsky> jdevel: ditto
[18:39:40] <philosophically> snover: lol, i just wanted to show urls when doing ajax calls
[18:39:45] <jdevel> my code works that I know
[18:39:46] <thomedy> okay is there a way to run a call back function recursively im noticing it only goes as many times a s you call the allack
[18:39:51] <imsky> philosophically: use hash...stuff
[18:40:02] <thomedy> which then is not reccursively
[18:40:08] <philosophically> imsky: what does that mean?
[18:40:09] <chamon83> thats great @imsky
[18:40:12] <jdevel> doesn't need to be
[18:40:13] <thomedy> im trying to create an endless animation
[18:40:26] <imsky> philosophically: you can add the URL at the end of the location hash, which will put it in the address bar
[18:40:37] <philosophically> ahhh
[18:40:43] <philosophically> imsky++ thank you
[18:40:48] <imsky> np bud
[18:43:29] <jdevel> anyhow, thanks for bringing that article to my attention.  Now I will know in the event that I ever run into an issue with setInterval.
[18:44:05] <jdevel> I think they should add a sleep function to js..
[18:44:19] <imsky> because that's what event driven languages do
[18:45:34] <jdevel> chrome sure updates a lot.. feel like i've updated 5 times this week
[18:48:22] <chamon83> hello somebody can help whit this problem ?         $("*[id$='BagregarGlobal']").click(function () {

[18:49:37] <chamon83> i'm new here i don't know how work this place! sorry!
[18:49:46] <jdevel> all good
[18:49:59] <jdevel> people will teach you quickly.
[18:50:24] <jdevel> best to use jsfiddle
[18:50:31] <jdevel> easiest to test etc..

[18:51:52] <jdevel> brb, need to code an email for a client fast..
[18:52:00] <educr0w> is a good practice to obfuscate or pack the js code?
[18:52:12] <jdevel> compress yes, for speed
[18:52:48] <jdevel> however, obfuscate.. eh anyone that really knows what they are doing and has the drive to read the code will know how to do it
[18:53:26] <jdevel> compressing will usually do the trick for your average cut and paste coder
[18:53:29] <educr0w> i have various ajax request, and it show file.php used and post parameters, is there any way of hiding that?
[18:54:08] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ajpiano (or anyone else): Ok, so I have wrapped the element properly. Any idea why the code is still failing with the error at the bottom of this link: http://pastebin.com/a1q9vfNw
[18:54:18] <jdevel> well, I think you should protect the file.php rather than worrying about hiding it
[18:56:29] <educr0w> if you see facebook source..what are they using ?
[18:57:15] <jdevel> for script compression?
[18:57:33] <educr0w> for the web. if you look is a mess
[18:57:49] <jdevel> server side generated
[18:58:35] <HAPPYFUNBRO> that said, it looks like the .trackname element still isn't being wrapped. any ideas?
[19:01:48] <HAPPYFUNBRO> anyone?
[19:03:59] <coldhead> HAPPYFUNBRO: should maybe line 12 be  if ($(class).val().length >= 50) {
[19:04:11] <coldhead> yours is missing the $ and (class) doesn't do much without it
[19:04:27] <HAPPYFUNBRO> coldhead fixed that
[19:04:47] <coldhead> ?cc
[19:04:47] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[19:04:57] <HAPPYFUNBRO> no
[19:05:00] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I fixed the $
[19:05:07] <HAPPYFUNBRO> it didn't solve the issue
[19:05:17] <coldhead> you still see the error about val?
[19:05:41] <coldhead> or you don't see the "wrapping"
[19:06:10] <HAPPYFUNBRO> well, I suppose this is a new issue now. I don't see the wrapping unless I do != some random number
[19:06:12] <ansimation>  here's the code: http://pastebin.com/WyaUk1Lv , here's what should be happening: click button and dialog appears with dynamically created modal. modal gets clicked, dialog and modal disappear. now on to the problem: everything works as described, but after the modal disappears if you hover over a button or use firebug, it shows the modal still being there. clicking it one more time makes it work as it should. but it should do that without requi
[19:06:12] <ansimation> ring the second click. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6RyEmDyJM - a screen cast of what's happening
[19:06:31] <coldhead> HAPPYFUNBRO: can you paste the updated code
[19:06:36] <HAPPYFUNBRO> yeah sec
[19:07:00] <HAPPYFUNBRO> coldhead http://pastebin.com/vZwkU68z
[19:07:07] <abjorn> https://www.facebook.com/BaconAustin this restaurant is exactly what you think it is
[19:08:05] <coldhead> HAPPYFUNBRO: perhaps you want .text() instead of .val() ?
[19:08:11] <coldhead> val() is only for inputs
[19:08:24] <coldhead> sorry if that's a bum steer, i can't see your html
[19:08:29] * coldhead guesses
[19:09:41] <coldhead> oh fuck this is the marquee thing
[19:10:10] <HAPPYFUNBRO> coldhead I'm trying to make the code do something if the length of a string (enclosed in class) is longer than a given length
[19:10:43] <coldhead> i have a vague idea of what you mean
[19:10:44] <foreverdrone> hey anyone around?
[19:11:02] <coldhead> i'd still try text().length instead of .val().length
[19:11:10] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[19:11:14] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I'll look into it
[19:11:14] <HAPPYFUNBRO> sec
[19:11:29] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I also need to put the marquee into that element
[19:16:24] <foreverdrone> i'm working on this site, http://nr.vesul.com, when you click strains, the 'everything' section items open in a lightbox but when you click another sort option like "hybrid" it no longer opens the strain in a lightbox
[19:17:54] <foreverdrone> i have no idea why it's doing that
[19:18:52] <HAPPYFUNBRO> coldhead got it. thanks so much
[19:18:56] <devinrolsen> foreverdrone, your click event. what happens if you change it to be $('elms').live('click',function(){...});
[19:19:05] <coldhead> happy hacking, HAPPYFUNBRO
[19:19:26] <foreverdrone> for the prettyphoto part?
[19:19:43] <devinrolsen> the event you have set to open the lightbox.
[19:19:46] <devinrolsen> change it be a live.
[19:19:49] <devinrolsen> I just wanna see what happens.
[19:20:11] <foreverdrone> haha, not sure i know how to do that
[19:20:40] <devinrolsen> are you the one who wrote the JS?
[19:20:57] <foreverdrone> i coded it, i used some scripts
[19:21:01] <foreverdrone> all jquery stuff
[19:21:11] <foreverdrone> haha i'm a designer first, coder second
[19:21:17] <devinrolsen> at some point, you set it up to open the lightbox when someone clicks on these thumbnails.
[19:21:44] <foreverdrone> yeah
[19:22:00] <foreverdrone> $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").prettyPhoto({
[19:22:03] <devinrolsen> change that click event you have setup to not be $(...).click(function(){...}); but be $(...).live('click',function(){...})
[19:22:08] <devinrolsen> ahh
[19:22:32] <devinrolsen> well that is not going to work then.
[19:23:07] <foreverdrone> haha, i was going to say i don't remember a line of code like that
[19:23:13] <devinrolsen> at some point, you are losing this click event that prettyPhoto sets up on these thumbnails to open the lightbox.
[19:23:29] <devinrolsen> it seems to happen when you change your tabs up top.
[19:23:30] <ansimation> .click( function(){ $.prettyPhoto()....
[19:23:47] <devinrolsen> could try it.
[19:23:58] <ansimation> or live('click', function(){ $.prettyPhoto
[19:25:06] <devinrolsen> are you using clone anywhere when you click these tabs up top foreverdrone?
[19:25:42] <foreverdrone> nope, its just filtering
[19:26:14] <devinrolsen> do as ansimation has suggested, lets see if live will keep these events bound.
[19:27:17] <jdevel> live is for assigning multi elements events
[19:27:30] <jdevel> all returned by selector
[19:27:48] <ansimation> i use it for events on elements that are added to the dom later on
[19:27:55] <devinrolsen> same here
[19:28:05] <devinrolsen> such as httprequests.
[19:28:09] <ansimation> right
[19:28:14] <jdevel> why not just add them at that point?
[19:28:20] <FD_Good> i dont understand jquery nor javascript wich one is the best ? XD
[19:28:23] <jdevel> in the return
[19:28:33] <ansimation> FD_Good, jquery is a javascript library
[19:28:34] <devinrolsen> cause writting an event bind  twice is just dumb.
[19:28:52] <jdevel> who said to do it twice?
[19:29:07] <devinrolsen> I did under an httprequest or "Ajax" situation.
[19:29:14] <jdevel> they only exist when created, bind once created..
[19:29:22] <devinrolsen> why not just define it once with live and never have to do it again.
[19:29:42] <jdevel> so long as it fits the criteria of the selector
[19:31:07] <devinrolsen> so if I understand you right jdevel, you are saying that if I have a list of list items I should bind an event to them on page load, then again when I want to pull more list items in via ajax's callback?
[19:31:10] <devinrolsen> makes no sense to me.
[19:31:16] <devinrolsen> just use live once and you are done.
[19:31:27] <jdevel> no
[19:31:28] <devinrolsen> for existing and newly added dom elements.
[19:31:30] <ansimation> any of you have any idea on this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6RyEmDyJM ? the code is here: http://pastebin.com/WyaUk1Lv
[19:31:30] <jdevel> that you are right
[19:31:46] <foreverdrone> ansimation: sorry dude, where do i post this in here ? $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").prettyPhoto({ ?
[19:31:56] <jdevel> I wasn't aware that it auto bound newly created elements injected into the dom
[19:32:04] <devinrolsen> indeed
[19:32:06] <jdevel> still learning this library a bit
[19:32:08] <devinrolsen> that is its main feature.
[19:32:09] <devinrolsen> ;)
[19:32:14] <jdevel> you are right, I stand corrected
[19:32:29] <ansimation> $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").live( 'click', function(){ $.prettyPhoto({...}); } );
[19:32:40] <jdevel> I like that feature..
[19:32:42] <devinrolsen> no one is right or wrong lol just all under the same standards ;)
[19:32:45] <ansimation> yeah, it's pretty sweet
[19:32:56] <jdevel> very sweet
[19:33:04] <foreverdrone> no go
[19:33:13] <foreverdrone> http://nr.vesul.com
[19:33:28] <ansimation> what are we trying to do?
[19:33:36] <devinrolsen> ok I suggested live.
[19:33:43] <ansimation> hey hey i like the content though, heh
[19:33:44] <devinrolsen> just to see if these were being lost or removed.
[19:34:06] <devinrolsen> something in your code is literly removing the events prettyPhoto sets up on these elements.
[19:34:26] <foreverdrone> so when you click strains and hit one of the sort buttons, it wont open in the lightbox anymore
[19:34:42] <ansimation> also, i'd suggest making this site work first without javascript before adding in the fancy effects and what not
[19:34:48] <ansimation> accessibility++
[19:35:16] <foreverdrone> it should be fineâ€¦ i hope :)
[19:35:21] <foreverdrone> nah, i'll double check of course
[19:35:25] <devinrolsen> accessibility is very important my friend.
[19:36:05] <devinrolsen> sorry not to take this conversation off the tracks foreverdrone, but if you get time always run your site at least once through http://wave.webaim.org/
[19:36:13] <devinrolsen> to measure how accessibility friendly your site is.
[19:36:16] <ansimation> one page load firebug also tells me Image corrupt or truncated: http://nr.vesul.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/skywalker-og-18.jpg
[19:36:16] <ansimation> http://nr.vesul.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/skywalker-og-18.jpg
[19:36:16] <ansimation> Line 0
[19:36:17] <devinrolsen> its important man.
[19:36:41] <ansimation> s/one/on/
[19:38:14] <ansimation> missing } after function body, not sure what the image error was about, i had js disabled. after enabling it though, it gives me this
[19:38:25] <ansimation> so there's part of your problem
[19:39:01] <jdevel> you ever feel like your doing someone else's work in here :)
[19:39:09] <jdevel> i have.
[19:40:09] <ansimation> sometimes, but i'm stuck on my own stuff so that's why i'm here. heh
[19:40:26] <foreverdrone> ah shit
[19:40:49] <foreverdrone> i dont't see the missing }
[19:41:01] <jdevel> oh, I often come here and just help people..
[19:41:11] <foreverdrone> nvm i think i got it
[19:41:16] <jdevel> and through that, I also learn more
[19:41:20] <foreverdrone> oops nvm
[19:41:36] <jdevel> drone, did you setup a fiddle?
[19:41:49] <jdevel> I'm going to upload some images to a server for an email so I'll have a sec to look.
[19:41:59] <foreverdrone> ansimation: where do you see it missing
[19:42:52] <ansimation> i don't. just what it tells me. hell i don't even see the script you're working on just a bunch of libraries included from wp_head() and wp_footer(). unless it's the stuff in the head but i didn't really look that over to well
[19:43:15] <ansimation> and it is, heh
[19:43:42] <jdevel> doesn't WP have it's own jquery includes?
[19:44:03] <jdevel> I'm not a big fan of WP
[19:44:07] <ansimation> you don't close the function in the callback for live() it look slike
[19:44:09] <foreverdrone> they're all in the head
[19:44:15] <ansimation> yeah, it does
[19:44:29] <ansimation> jdevel^
[19:44:41] <ansimation> i'm a huge fan of wp :D
[19:44:43] <foreverdrone> so, "	    $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").live( 'click', function()){ $.prettyPhoto ({ "
[19:44:47] <jdevel> yea?
[19:44:59] <foreverdrone> ?
[19:45:03] <jdevel> it's rather bloated
[19:45:04] <ansimation> yeah, basically all i work with for the most part
[19:45:23] <foreverdrone> i think wp is the opposite of bloated
[19:45:31] <ansimation> meh a little but it makes things easy
[19:45:31] <foreverdrone> drupal and joomla are super bloated
[19:45:40] <madprops> any idea how can I avoid the $.get function to not execute until the name_file function is complete? http://www.radpaste.com/154/
[19:45:48] <violence> i love you!
[19:45:51] <jdevel> I use a diff CMS usually
[19:46:46] <jdevel> I used WP long ago, but the newer versions interfaces aren't so intuitive
[19:47:06] <jdevel> always waste time explaining how to use it
[19:47:23] <danzik17> madprops: see ?deferred
[19:47:23] <foreverdrone> no luck after closing the function in the callback for live
[19:47:23] <bot-t> madprops, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[19:47:24] <ansimation> and they just redid it agian in 3.0. it's not too shabby i don't think. my customers like it anyway
[19:47:26] <foreverdrone> unless i did this wrong
[19:48:11] <jdevel> maybe, perhaps I'll take a look at the newer version
[19:48:21] <jdevel> i wasn't a fan of some of the labels for sections etc..
[19:48:30] <foreverdrone> you can edit all that
[19:48:32] <jdevel> clients asking what's this.. what's thate
[19:48:34] <foreverdrone> with some work at least
[19:48:39] <foreverdrone> and you can hide some things
[19:48:41] <foreverdrone> from certain users
[19:48:59] <ansimation> http://pastebin.com/zW8Q90iz
[19:49:01] <devinrolsen> I use wp myself. I like it.
[19:49:01] <jdevel> another issue I have with that is security
[19:49:22] <jdevel> when an exploit is found you need to run around like a nut patching
[19:49:43] <ansimation> no, just hit update
[19:49:58] <jdevel> yea, after logging into 40 installations..
[19:50:00] <foreverdrone> ansimation: still opening in new window
[19:50:03] <foreverdrone> well, same window
[19:50:05] <foreverdrone> but not in lightbox
[19:50:15] <ansimation> jdevel, use multisite if you ahve that many installations
[19:50:38] <jdevel> i'll look into it
[19:50:46] <jdevel> ever use Concrete5 ?
[19:51:00] <foreverdrone> ive looked into it, never developed on it though
[19:51:06] <ansimation> $.prettyPhoto is not a function it says. try changing it to ($this).prettyPhoto({
[19:51:14] <jdevel> that's what I've been using
[19:51:37] <ansimation> no, never even heard of it actually. but like i said my business is wordpress oriented and everything i do it usually related to it one way or another so
[19:51:43] <foreverdrone> still no go
[19:52:14] <ansimation> well, pretty photo is loaded in the footer. but it's in document.ready so not sure
[19:52:17] <jdevel> yea, well since you all seems so adamant about it, perhaps I will give it a go next project again
[19:52:30] <jdevel> see how it feels
[19:52:37] <ansimation> worth a try anyway :)
[19:52:44] <jdevel> after I wrap up this stupid classic asp project
[19:52:58] <foreverdrone> weird, i'm not loading it in the footer
[19:53:00] <devinrolsen> I'm almost certain that our issue lives in the the tabs you click up top.
[19:53:02] <ansimation> i dont know if you saw that youtube video about what my problem was but i'm doin that on wp
[19:53:20] <foreverdrone> devinrolsen: i agree, the sort right?
[19:53:25] <devinrolsen> yes
[19:53:31] <devinrolsen> could you show us that code please?
[19:53:34] <foreverdrone> i thought the same thing, its breaking something
[19:53:46] <devinrolsen> well its removing this lightbox's click events.
[19:53:55] <devinrolsen> not just breaking.. but being a punk as well.
[19:54:24] <foreverdrone> http://nr.vesul.com/wp-content/themes/natural-remedies-2/js/menusort.js
[19:54:30] <foreverdrone> http://nr.vesul.com/wp-content/themes/natural-remedies-2/js/jquery.quicksand.js
[19:54:47] <ansimation> use a different lightbox. hell thickbox is included with wp. it's not the best looking of the bunch but it's still appealing
[19:55:07] <devinrolsen> eww thickbox :(
[19:55:26] <ansimation> lol yeah
[19:55:32] <jdevel> or write your own plugin
[19:55:36] <devinrolsen> I always recommend colorbox now.
[19:55:51] <devinrolsen> its what we use at our shop now days.
[19:55:53] <foreverdrone> well this essentially loading an iframe
[19:55:59] <foreverdrone> does colorbox support iframes?
[19:56:01] <devinrolsen> yes
[19:56:06] <ansimation> most of them do
[19:56:08] <devinrolsen> but that is not the problem.
[19:56:09] <foreverdrone> i would like to use ajax but it gets weird with the zoom
[19:56:11] <devinrolsen> sorted foreverdrone...
[19:56:14] <devinrolsen> what is this plugin?
[19:56:23] <devinrolsen> IT is the one removing the events from these elements.
[19:56:29] <foreverdrone> which plugin?
[19:56:49] <devinrolsen> var $sortedData = $filteredData.sorted({
[19:56:58] <devinrolsen> I assume you use sorted to sort the thumbs?
[19:57:00] <devinrolsen> no?
[19:57:18] <foreverdrone> yeah
[19:57:41] <devinrolsen> oh wait.
[19:57:49] <devinrolsen> grr sorry, so distracted right now.
[19:57:58] <devinrolsen> I didn't want to see this plugin's code haha.
[19:58:16] <devinrolsen> sorry I wanted to see your code you wrote that sets up the functions for these tabs.
[19:58:26] <jdevel> what IDE's do you guys use?
[19:58:30] <jdevel> Komodo anyone?
[19:58:37] <devinrolsen> do you have like a global.js you wrote you code in?
[19:58:41] <devinrolsen> TopStyle4
[19:58:52] <ansimation> i use nusphere phped
[19:59:01] <jdevel> yea I have that too
[19:59:03] <foreverdrone> devinrolsen: sorry i'm lost, what do you mean?
[19:59:18] <jdevel> also visual studio for windows based projects
[19:59:19] <devinrolsen> show me the file you wrote your jquery code in.
[19:59:25] <devinrolsen> that is the code for your sorted plugin.
[19:59:31] <devinrolsen> that you just showed me.
[20:00:03] <foreverdrone> its in the header
[20:01:06] <devinrolsen> you know when someone clicks say "Hybrid"
[20:01:14] <devinrolsen> and the thumb nails get shifted off the page..
[20:01:16] <foreverdrone> yeah
[20:01:19] <devinrolsen> that code is in the header?
[20:01:20] <foreverdrone> thats through menusort.js
[20:01:33] <foreverdrone> the plugin is that quicksand link
[20:01:40] <foreverdrone> http://nr.vesul.com/wp-content/themes/natural-remedies-2/js/jquery.quicksand.js
[20:01:56] <devinrolsen> foreverdrone..
[20:02:04] <devinrolsen> you told me you didn't use a clone :)
[20:02:17] <devinrolsen> var $data = $applications.clone();
[20:02:19] <foreverdrone> OH, i thought you meant, 'are you cloning elements'
[20:02:31] <devinrolsen> is this associated with these thumbs?
[20:02:39] <devinrolsen> if so, change it to be .clone(true);
[20:02:42] <devinrolsen> see if that helps.
[20:03:42] <foreverdrone> same thing
[20:04:39] <jdevel> forever.. it might be one of those times where you stand up, take a short walk, then come back..
[20:04:43] <foreverdrone> sorry, like i said, designer first, coder second :(
[20:05:08] <foreverdrone> i just can't figure out what's actually changing when i sort
[20:05:10] <foreverdrone> looks the same as before
[20:05:13] <devinrolsen> try one more thing .clone(true,true)
[20:05:19] <devinrolsen> a deep clone
[20:05:53] <mikeycgto> when using jquery to create elements (ie $('<li>')) when do you need to close the tag?
[20:06:04] <foreverdrone> same thing
[20:06:30] <devinrolsen> I got nothin.
[20:06:43] <devinrolsen> got to be some conflict between a plugin or two you are using.
[20:06:47] <foreverdrone> yeah
[20:06:49] <foreverdrone> thats what i figured
[20:06:53] <devinrolsen> check out colorbox
[20:06:55] <foreverdrone> dunno what though
[20:07:11] <devinrolsen> http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[20:07:12] <foreverdrone> thanks for the help though, i'll def check out colorbox. prettyphoto is pissing me off anyways
[20:07:23] <devinrolsen> yeah it seems flimsy
[20:07:56] <foreverdrone> looks much cleaner too (colorbox)
[20:08:47] <jdevel> i'm working (slowly) on a slider plugin.. haven't been happy with the ones I've seen/used.
[20:09:00] <foreverdrone> have you used anythingSlider?
[20:09:00] <jdevel> too much other work keeps getting in the way
[20:09:11] <jdevel> is that the one they want you to pay for?
[20:09:16] <jdevel> for commercial use
[20:09:40] <Daniwan> Quick question.  Why does this timer only trigger once?   $(document).ready(function() { $(document).everyTime(10000, $("#lifebar").load("game/lifebar.php"), 0); });
[20:10:06] <jdevel> i've also noticed a lot of the plugins are so bloated with css.. always an extra css file to load.. which is annoying
[20:10:20] <jdevel> so mine will not have that crap, you pass your own elements in for controls etc..
[20:11:13] <jdevel> it gets crazy, I see so many sites loading like 15 script files, then 20 css files, it is ridiculous
[20:11:33] <nathanb> hey, does anyone know where i can find an example of an incremental load on scroll ?
[20:11:38] <jdevel> often complements of cut and paste coding
[20:11:47] <devinrolsen> soo you are going to write all the style inline then jdevel?
[20:11:52] <jdevel> no
[20:12:09] <jdevel> you pass your own elements in
[20:12:20] <Daniwan> Anyone have an ideas as to why this timer only triggers once?  $(document).ready(function() { $(document).everyTime(10000, $("#lifebar").load("game/lifebar.php"), 0); });
[20:12:21] <danzik17> jdevel: 15 script files?  I only wish we were loading that few.
[20:12:24] <jdevel> then have your own css handle everything else
[20:12:47] <jdevel> scripts I mean JS
[20:12:52] <jdevel> not php includes etc..
[20:13:03] <danzik17> No, I knew exactly what you meant =P
[20:13:05] <jdevel> or asp, or .net placeholders
[20:13:07] <jdevel> k
[20:13:14] <Daniwan> jdevel I have to agree that many sites / plugins / libraries are way out of hand.
[20:13:32] <Daniwan> It's like the world doesn't realize it's faster to read one large file then the 15000 small files.
[20:13:40] <jdevel> exactly
[20:13:46] <Daniwan> Makes a large performance difference especially on fragmented drives
[20:13:58] <jdevel> not to mention then you have them externally hosted on CDNs etc
[20:14:03] <Daniwan> rule of thumb, if your host is windows it's fragmented
[20:14:08] <jdevel> really start to drag the sites down
[20:14:53] <ansimation> any of you have any idea on this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6RyEmDyJM ? the code is here: http://pastebin.com/cH2AAJL5
[20:15:02] <Daniwan> I think the major problem is that too many people don't understand the subtle differences between scripting languages and compiled languages
[20:15:29] <jdevel> yea..
[20:15:31] <Daniwan> Like in compiled languages it's recommended to create more source files to keep your code clean.  Like one object per file or what have you.
[20:15:41] <devinrolsen> lol, guys guys you have to realize that your only observing plugin authoring from one angle (your only needs from the plugin). Most are writing to accommodate large areas of flexibility left up to the end uses.
[20:16:11] <Daniwan> This does not effect end user performance because it's compiled into one (or maybe just a couple) binary executables
[20:16:22] <Daniwan> or CLR executables in some cases
[20:16:23] <jdevel> i understand this, but when you start to stack many plugins on top of one another it gets out of hand
[20:16:27] <Daniwan> CRL*
[20:16:57] <devinrolsen> yes and at that point.. is it really the plugins fault, or your own for relying on plugins still?
[20:17:11] <devinrolsen> or least that many ;)
[20:17:18] <jdevel> that's why I often code my own shit
[20:17:42] <jdevel> might take a little longer, but will often work much better
[20:17:53] <Daniwan> My problem is most of my clients bring their own baggage lol
[20:18:02] <devinrolsen> slap them
[20:18:02] <jdevel> oh I know about that
[20:18:05] <devinrolsen> or fire em.
[20:18:07] <Daniwan> They come to me with a site that already uses 15 plugins that they won't pay to rewrite
[20:18:30] <jdevel> I hear you.. I'm stuck finishing a site/system in classic asp
[20:18:36] <jdevel> i'd rather be using php
[20:18:41] <geekbuntu> also, if you're delivering payload data for the initial load, then you wouldn't want to load all the data depending on the event logic?  why load everything for somebody who just wants to look at one area?
[20:18:49] <Daniwan> god I hate ASP and ASP.NET lol
[20:19:09] <Daniwan> Especially ASP.NET...  What the hell where they thinking
[20:19:13] <jdevel> classic asp ... come on now..
[20:19:23] <jdevel> well asp.net can be alright
[20:19:23] <devinrolsen> geekbuntu cause we want visitors to cache our js and css.
[20:19:26] <Daniwan> I'd rather use classic then .net lol
[20:19:33] <Daniwan> .net is WAY to heavy for no reason
[20:19:39] <devinrolsen> so the rest of the page and sites loading experience is much faster.
[20:19:46] <devinrolsen> pages*
[20:19:49] <jdevel> it depends on what your trying to do
[20:19:57] <geekbuntu> devinrolsen, if you're have a small group of tmpl templates then sure - but a ton of json would be excessive (depending on the size of the site)
[20:20:09] <Daniwan> Well again I'm constrained by client requests in a lot of cases... lol
[20:20:10] <jdevel> I wrote a system that was huge about 1 million lines of code a couple years ago in asp.net
[20:20:22] <Daniwan> So if they want me to add a form to a .NET project I have to use the MS controls
[20:20:33] <Daniwan> Take a textbox for example
[20:20:37] <geekbuntu> jdevel, 1 milion lines of code in asp is a hello world?
[20:20:43] <jdevel> lol
[20:20:56] <devinrolsen> I just loled myself.
[20:21:01] <geekbuntu> i had to take the mcpd cert course at a job i had
[20:21:02] <jdevel> I genuinely laughed
[20:21:13] <geekbuntu> tblew my mind how much code was compiled for the tiniest app
[20:21:19] <jdevel> I hear you
[20:21:21] <geekbuntu> insane
[20:21:26] <jdevel> but I'm not talking about that..
[20:21:27] <Daniwan> It's an HTML element, but in .NET to create one using the MS textbox control you increase memory and bandwidth whilest decreasing performance on your server waiting for it to connect to the .NET framework, build a text box and then render it as a HTML textbox
[20:21:31] <jdevel> I am talking about writing
[20:21:34] <jdevel> not the generated shit
[20:21:44] <geekbuntu> then the dude died when i asked him how he knew which library  to look in for features
[20:21:49] <geekbuntu> no one knows
[20:22:04] <geekbuntu> .net library is hell
[20:22:15] * geekbuntu sorry... just had to join the rant
[20:22:18] <devinrolsen> you know what I hate.. is when our shop gets a new client and we open up their global.css on to be shown 10k lines of 3 - 5 element selectors.
[20:22:19] <Daniwan> .NET = best thing that happened to Windows Desktop apps
[20:22:24] <jdevel> there is a reason I moved most of my development to linux
[20:22:24] <devinrolsen> my soul died.
[20:22:35] <Daniwan> Microsoft just needs to accept defeat in the web hosting department IMO
[20:22:39] <jdevel> but I can't get away from windows all the time
[20:22:46] <Daniwan> I hear ya
[20:22:55] <geekbuntu> microsoft was intended to be a whorehouse and they succeeded
[20:23:01] <geekbuntu> they made money
[20:23:03] <jdevel> sometimes I take over these other projects.. because I all too often get the projects someone else couldn't finish
[20:23:04] <Daniwan> You get those customers that want to use MS Servers because they are more expensive?
[20:23:11] <geekbuntu> made peopel fuzzy
[20:23:21] <geekbuntu> now they're rich and we've been screwed
[20:23:32] <geekbuntu> hmmm, i like that analogy
[20:23:41] <jdevel> it's usually because people pick a side and only do it that way
[20:23:50] <jdevel> without caring what is good for the client
[20:23:57] <geekbuntu> people who know very little listen to the person who looks most like them
[20:24:04] <jdevel> lol
[20:24:10] <jdevel> your a funny bastard
[20:24:22] <foreverdrone> AHHH
[20:24:24] <Daniwan> I dunno, I get those silly clients that think the more you pay the better it is
[20:24:27] <geekbuntu> if linux ppl could asimulate better, we would have more market share
[20:24:28] <foreverdrone> devinrolsen: now colorbox isn't working
[20:24:30] <foreverdrone> i have no idea why
[20:24:37] <Daniwan> "Linux can't be a good web server it's free"
[20:24:38] <devinrolsen> its the sort plugin man.
[20:24:49] <jdevel> eh
[20:24:54] <Daniwan> "What do you mean Microsoft isn't better?  I payed $20,000 for it"
[20:24:54] <geekbuntu> don't believe the propaganda
[20:25:03] <jdevel> those people I charge 200/hr.
[20:25:09] <geekbuntu> and most suck
[20:25:24] <geekbuntu> i ahd those guys asking me to fisx thier home pcs
[20:25:35] <geekbuntu> man the painkillers have kicked in
[20:25:37] <geekbuntu> omg
[20:25:43] <Daniwan> oooh, perks?
[20:25:45] <Daniwan> :-p
[20:25:45] * geekbuntu *looks for beatles album*
[20:26:04] <geekbuntu> i take meds for severe add
[20:26:06] <geekbuntu> adhd/ocd
[20:26:13] <geekbuntu> and when i forget and take a pain killer
[20:26:18] <geekbuntu> it's an e ticket ride
[20:26:21] <coldhead> long long long time
[20:26:22] <jdevel> you get HD with them pills?
[20:26:23] <devinrolsen> do you have clean code ocd?
[20:26:26] <geekbuntu> my jack russels are lookinga t me
[20:26:44] <geekbuntu> my wife says if my office was as neat as the inside of my pc - she'd be happy
[20:26:56] <geekbuntu> my os/system/fs is perfect
[20:26:59] <geekbuntu> :-D
[20:27:29] <geekbuntu> too bad imsky isn't here
[20:27:35] <geekbuntu> twhen i have these trips he can talk me down
[20:27:40] <geekbuntu> lmao
[20:27:54] <foreverdrone> it wont work even without the sort stuff
[20:44:15] <SergSergiu> hello
[20:44:31] <phil_bw> so has anyone here used dreamweaver cs5 live view with jquery's $.getJSON? It won't load my ajax in live view
[20:44:43] <draginx1> uninstall dreamweaver problem solved
[20:45:10] <SergSergiu> $('#browser').click(function(){ .. , i need help to write like <button onclick="Example()">Bottone 1</button>
[20:45:15] <SergSergiu> can help me someone?
[20:46:33] <coldhead> you shouldn't use onclick with jQuery
[20:46:43] <coldhead> why do you think you need to do that?
[20:46:54] <phil_bw> so has anyone here tested an html file locally that uses jquery's $.getJSON? It won't load my ajax :P
[20:47:21] <coldhead> you can't do ajax on file:/// stuff
[20:47:28] <coldhead> you need to use localhost or something
[20:47:45] <phil_bw> :/ I was hoping that wasn't the case
[20:48:21] <phil_bw> I'm really new to using ajax so I was hoping there was some kind of override (whether it be in jquery or on the server) to allow it for testing purposes
[20:48:33] <SergSergiu> coldhead, i copyed "fly-out" menu , and i cant add id=some :( not running
[20:49:01] <ColloquyUser> If on a mac navigate to the directory in the terminal and fire up sim leggy server
[20:49:16] <coldhead> phil_bw: maybe you can tell the browser to be cool
[20:49:30] <coldhead> or um hack the source of the browser to force it to be cool
[20:49:35] <ColloquyUser> SimpleHTTPServer
[20:49:40] <phil_bw> any recommendations on a lightweight windows web server for testing purposes only?
[20:49:43] <phil_bw> well then
[20:50:00] <phil_bw> ColloquyUser, answered my question before I asked...
[20:50:02] <coldhead> ?p  SergSergiu
[20:50:02] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[20:51:05] <phil_bw> I've used pretty much all of the major windows web servers in some form or another over the past few years.  They all work, just wondered if you guys recommended one
[20:51:25] <SergSergiu> my dialog windows running in other items on page,only on menu not running :(
[20:52:12] <ColloquyUser> The python SimpleHTTPServer works great for quickly running a server in a directory . Just not sure how to go about it on windows
[20:52:40] <coldhead> just download python from python.org
[20:52:45] <coldhead> not python.com
[20:52:51] <coldhead> and run the installer
[20:53:27] <SergSergiu> coldhead have some ideea with my problem? :<
[20:54:32] <phil_bw> well off to bed for now, thanks guys

[20:57:12] <coldhead> SergSergiu: i just want to see the code you have written, i understand you are using a plugin but i don't understand HOW you are using it
[20:57:24] <coldhead> if you don't want to paste it you'll have to learn english really well
[20:57:30] <coldhead> so you can explain
[20:57:42] <coldhead> or i can learn spanish
[20:57:49] <coldhead> NO ME GUSTA

[20:58:14] <ColloquyUser> I vote engrish
[20:58:41] <SergSergiu> i can give you original url where is my code
[20:58:44] <ColloquyUser> Damn not sure why my names not showing up.
[20:58:45] <SergSergiu> i cant put this on pastebin
[20:58:45] <SergSergiu> :)
[20:59:02] <coldhead> fine, link to something, i am rapidly losing interest
[20:59:14] <coldhead> like a woman's love loses interst

[21:08:26] <SergSergiu> :))
[21:08:34] <SergSergiu> coldhead not running
[21:08:57] <devongovett> did chrome recently start updating CSS properties asynchronously? because I'm having cases where `div.style.background` != what I just set it to if the background image is changed in rapid succession...

[21:10:24] <coldhead> top of the marning to you, blackspotwiggins
[21:11:02] <coldhead> so i am coming to appreciate
[21:12:06] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hey I want to append a new div to an already existing one and then fade it in
[21:12:14] <Nicolas_Leonida2> but append doesn't have a callback does it?
[21:12:41] <coldhead> SergSergiu: add a alert("HELLO I AM WORKING") inside the .live function, SergSergiu, and you will see it is working. the div.dialog stuff probably isn't working but i don't know anything about that
[21:12:44] <coldhead> i am going away
[21:12:47] <coldhead> GOOD DAY, SIR
[21:13:40] <SergSergiu> i added "," and not running :( maybe is blocked by this $('#menuSelection').text($(item).text());

[21:21:45] <Doonce> â”¬â”€â”€â”¬ ãƒŽ( ã‚œ-ã‚œãƒŽ) There's no need for that kind of behavior. Just count to ten and take a little break okay?
[21:23:33] <blackspotwiggins> Doonce, ok :)
[21:24:11] <Doonce> ï¼ˆâ•¯Â°â–¡Â°ï¼‰â•¯ï¸µ 69
[21:24:48] <Doonce> on http://doonce.com/test/vexea/serializeArray.htm  why does it not fade in correctly if you check one after none were checked..
[21:25:19] <b1lly> doonce, try to stop the animation before you fade it, i see you have a loop that hides it constantly, maybe the animation is getting caught up?
[21:26:17] <Doonce> it only does it when you check one after none were checked
[21:26:20] <Doonce> like.. on page load
[21:26:26] <Doonce> or after you uncheck all and check one
[21:27:08] <Doonce> dont see how the animation would be getting caught up on page load, and then not when all get checked
[21:27:54] <b1lly> you have a constant loop
[21:28:57] <b1lly> what are you trying to do anyway?
[21:30:53] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. I have a function that returns a string. That string is the name of a function that I need to call. How do I call it?
[21:31:26] <b1lly> Whirl3d: a few ways
[21:31:49] <Doonce> fade out an element, show selected divs, fade in element
[21:31:50] <b1lly> Whirl3d: you can if (var == "functionname") { functionname() }
[21:32:14] <Whirl3d> b1lly, that presumes you have a hash table of functions, I don't
[21:32:46] <b1lly> ?EVAL
[21:32:46] <Whirl3d> right now I am using switch(funcVar) {   } to do just that
[21:32:46] <bot-t1> b1lly: Syntax: ? EVAL <javascript code>
[21:32:50] <b1lly> ?eval
[21:32:51] <bot-t1> b1lly: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[21:32:54] <b1lly> ?eval()
[21:32:55] <bot-t1> b1lly, jQuery.globalEval() - Execute some JavaScript code globally. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[21:33:02] <b1lly> hmm
[21:33:21] <b1lly> Whirl3d: so what's the problem?
[21:33:30] <Doonce> where is the thing constant?
[21:33:33] <ngharo> Whirl3d: why not just return the function and not a string?
[21:33:54] <b1lly> Doonce: setTimeout is a loop
[21:34:06] <Whirl3d> I don't know how. I have a div that needs to have a function run on its contents before it is displayed
[21:34:10] <b1lly> Doonce: I don't see anyhting that breaks out of the loop
[21:34:21] <Whirl3d> each div has it's own function.
[21:34:35] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, the hash method is better than eval()
[21:34:46] <blackspotwiggins> functionpile[nameoffunc]()
[21:35:07] <Whirl3d> functionpile?
[21:35:07] <Doonce> settimeout is a loop? i thought setinterval was..
[21:35:15] <Whirl3d> nevermind, duh. Just got that
[21:35:17] <Whirl3d> lol
[21:35:32] <b1lly> Doonce: woops
[21:35:47] <Whirl3d> I guess I'll just store the init script in the data object of the div and then call it when needed.
[21:36:00] <Whirl3d> thnks for your help everybody
[21:36:27] <b1lly> Doonce: can you jsfiddle?
[21:38:33] <Daniwan> Anyone see what I'm doing wrong?  This timer only triggers once.  $(document).ready(function() { $(document).everyTime(10000, $("#lifebar").load("game/lifebar.php"), 0); });
[21:39:18] <Doonce> http://jsfiddle.net/Wg3nV/1/
[21:40:17] <ngharo> Daniwan: i think you need to wrap your looping code inside function() { }
[21:41:01] <b1lly> doonce so when you click green, you want it to display green
[21:41:09] <Doonce> yes
[21:41:17] <Doonce> it works fine, but only if one is already checked
[21:41:25] <Doonce> if none are checked and you check one.. it doesnt fade, just shows.
[21:42:58] <Daniwan> ngharo tried that, it wont even fire once whilest wrapped in a function
[21:43:15] <Daniwan> Also tried to call an external function instead, that has the same single call result
[21:44:05] <ngharo> Daniwan: welp im not familiar with everyTime but you could just do setInterval(function(){ $("#lifebar").load("game/lifebar.php"); }, 10000);
[21:44:24] <Daniwan> Yeah, that does work
[21:44:31] <Daniwan> Was just trying to stay with jquery
[21:45:08] <blackspotwiggins> ugh, position() of jqueryui is constantly broken
[21:47:02] <ngharo> Doonce: change this to fadeIn -> $.viewMap[field.value].show();
[21:47:23] <ngharo> Daniwan: stick with what works :)
[21:47:37] <Doonce> ah. well. hm.
[21:47:41] <Daniwan> By that logic I shouldn't be using jquery at all?
[21:47:42] <Daniwan> lol
[21:47:47] <ngharo> its possible a plugin can be shit
[21:47:56] <blackspotwiggins> s/possible/likely
[21:48:02] <ngharo> :)
[21:48:14] <Daniwan> I mean I'm trying as hard as I can to give jquery a fair evaluation
[21:48:26] <Daniwan> but I'm already seeing it fail time after time
[21:48:37] <Doonce> why thank you ngharo
[21:48:47] <ngharo> Daniwan: don't judge jquery by third party plugins
[21:48:55] <Doonce> is there a reason why its not working correctly, this seems kind of like a workaround.. idk
[21:49:01] <blackspotwiggins> Daniwan, noone is forcing you use jquery. if you don't like it, there are many alternatives
[21:49:10] <Daniwan> even $("#mydiv").html("whatever") will fail sometimes
[21:49:16] <Daniwan> I know black, pay attention buddy
[21:49:24] <Daniwan> lol I'm evaluating it trying to find reasons to use it
[21:49:39] <courpse> Just looks liek you're moaning about it to me.
[21:49:39] <Daniwan> You would think users of this room would support jquery instead of telling me to not use it
[21:49:41] <ngharo> Daniwan: html() shouldnt be failing.  you must be doing something incorrect
[21:49:47] <Whirl3d> So what happens when I load content via ajax that has a function defined in it's header that conflicts with a globally defined function in the parent doc?
[21:50:10] <b1lly> Doonce:  http://jsfiddle.net/Wg3nV/5/?
[21:50:11] <Daniwan> It fails dependant on when you create the div in relation to when you DEFINE the div
[21:50:23] <b1lly> doonce: http://jsfiddle.net/Wg3nV/5/         ?
[21:50:25] <blackspotwiggins> Daniwan, why should we tell you to use it?
[21:50:26] <courpse> Daniwan, Heh, thats not how it works, we're not going to convince you to use it, we dont really care if you do or don't. And if we don't have to lsiten to you moan, then we'd point towards don't use it
[21:50:39] <Daniwan> Because your in this room as a supporter of the system
[21:50:46] <Doonce> b1lly, it has been fixed already.. but with yours, try checking multiple ones
[21:51:01] <blackspotwiggins> you have a cool understanding of world
[21:51:04] <Doonce> they had me change the .show() to fadeIn()
[21:51:05] <ngharo> create vs define?  i dont understand
[21:51:07] <Doonce> works..
[21:51:13] <Daniwan> Well I think this has just answered my questions
[21:51:32] <Daniwan> Apperantly jquery is just a waste of space if people that use it wont even recomend it lol
[21:51:42] <blackspotwiggins> yes it is
[21:51:44] <Whirl3d> troll
[21:51:46] <blackspotwiggins> now gtfo
[21:51:49] <ngharo> Daniwan: we give solutions to problems.  In your case the solution was setInterval.  If you want to debug the plugin that's fine but you must point towards that route
[21:52:08] <Doonce> you did try to clean it up a little though..
[21:52:14] <Daniwan> black, keep trying buddy lol
[21:52:47] <Daniwan> I'm used to assholes that come in these rooms to bash people cause they themselves can't actually program
[21:52:58] <Tobbi> Hello. What's wrong about this code? http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1317368 ? For some reason the handler never gets called.
[21:53:13] <ngharo> let's keep on topic ladies :)
[21:53:14] <Daniwan> When you get on my level and have 15+ years experience and 15 certiications in programing and electronics then maybe I'll take heed to anything that ever comes out of your mouth
[21:53:22] <blackspotwiggins> Daniwan, big words from someone who cant figure out js basics
[21:53:41] <ngharo> oh boy, nothing worse than an ego trip on irc
[21:53:53] <Daniwan> lol
[21:54:09] <Daniwan> Yeah, that is a bit conceded
[21:54:23] <Daniwan> Just sick of people that themselves don't know what they're doing trying to belittle my abilities
[21:54:24] <Whirl3d> isn't easy to ignore in all irc clients? Or is it just mIRC that makes it easy?
[21:54:33] <Daniwan> just mIRC whirl
[21:54:43] <Daniwan> Trillian doesn't have such a feature ;)
[21:54:53] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, /ignore should work
[21:55:13] <Whirl3d> my point exactly. LOL
[21:55:25] <Daniwan> I guess /ignore does work.  Good call black I don't have to see you anymore
[21:55:36] <blackspotwiggins> oh waaw
[21:56:02] <ngharo> oh no you di'nt *snaps fingers*
[21:56:14] <Daniwan> anyway, back to the point.  ngharo you may know this answer.  everyTime comes from a jquery plugin not jquery itself?  The documentation I gatherd from W3Schools led me to believe everyTime was core functionality
[21:56:28] <blackspotwiggins> haha
[21:56:31] <ngharo> Daniwan: first off w3schools suxors
[21:56:31] <blackspotwiggins> w3schools
[21:56:40] <ngharo> Daniwan: and no, it's not in the core api
[21:56:41] <blackspotwiggins> 15+ certificates didnt help there
[21:57:18] <ngharo> i think plugins that mimic native JS funcs are just plain silly
[21:57:19] <Daniwan> actually W3Schools says exactly word for word what the jquery documentation does on this matter.
[21:57:37] <Daniwan> Both of which lead those of us new to the lib to think it's a core feature
[21:58:04] <ngharo> api.jquery.com - its not there
[21:58:04] <blackspotwiggins> ngharo, have you tried the arithmetic addon for jquery? i heard its pretty neat
[21:58:14] <blackspotwiggins> $.add(4,5) -> 9
[21:58:32] <ngharo> $('#one').plus($('#two')) PHEW
[21:58:39] <ngharo> lol blackspotwiggins
[21:58:44] <Rinthe> can someone give me some help with bbq hash history?
[21:58:51] <Rinthe> im trying to implement it to my website
[21:58:56] <blackspotwiggins> ?ask @ Rinthe
[21:58:56] <bot-t1> Rinthe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:59:09] <ngharo> bot-t1000
[21:59:37] <Daniwan> Maybe that one was just my own overlooking of what appears obvious now
[21:59:42] <Daniwan> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/timers
[21:59:56] <Daniwan> I guess the part that says PLUGINS.jquery.com should have been a flag huh?  lol
[22:00:15] <ngharo> Daniwan: yeah hehe
[22:00:28] <coldhead> ben_alman: bbq halp? :D
[22:00:30] <Daniwan> ok, commence with the insults lol I deserve those
[22:00:39] <ngharo> you fool!!
[22:01:02] <Rinthe> well in bbq's example, he's loading external html files. I have this image slider that keeps track by a hash number and an index. and i want to use bbq hash history with it
[22:01:21] <Daniwan> ngharo, since you seem to be fairly well versed.  Would you say I can trust the AJAX plugin?  Or is there something I should be aware of as well?
[22:02:02] <ngharo> ajax is part of jquery core, so yes
[22:02:11] <ngharo> the core devs know whats up.  They're no dumb butts.
[22:02:13] <Daniwan> So far my only use of it was simply to load html which it seems to be working well
[22:02:34] <Daniwan> Just noticed that it is listed as a plugin and figured I'd ask
[22:02:53] <Doonce> thank you b1lly and ngharo
[22:03:08] <ngharo> Daniwan: hm?
[22:03:12] <ngharo> ?ajax @ Daniwan
[22:03:12] <bot-t1> Daniwan, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:03:24] <Doonce> b1lly.. your one you sent needs serializeArray, otherwise it loses all other checked ones.
[22:03:41] <jmoney> jquery.ajax is quite nicely designed
[22:03:51] <Daniwan> http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins?type=47
[22:04:02] <Daniwan> on the left it's listed as the first plugin under all
[22:04:24] <coldhead> that's a category
[22:04:32] <coldhead> for ajax related plugins
[22:04:46] <Daniwan> ahh
[22:05:00] <ngharo> stick to the api docs.  I'd guess 99% of what you need is there already
[22:05:17] <ngharo> plugins are for chumps!
[22:05:33] * ngharo is a chump
[22:06:46] <coldhead> the ajax queue plugins have their place
[22:06:53] <Daniwan> Thanks ngharo I will keep that in mind.  Glad someone could bring that to my attention
[22:15:12] <SIDU> coldhead: hello
[22:26:21] <bobdobbs> I want to debug a slideshow plugin from firefox. Can I use something in firebug to pause the script?
[22:26:37] <jmoney> i believe theres a way to set breakpoints in the script pane
[22:27:26] <psilo2> there definitely is, you can also inspect variables etc
[22:28:21] <bobdobbs> ok, I see 'breakpoints' in the menu
[22:39:21] <DeManDinG> whats the right jquery to register an event when user clicks in textarea?
[22:44:38] <xp_prg> hi wonderful jQuery people, I am trying to use fancybox but I am confused how to populate the images it will show via ajax, anyone know?
[22:46:03] <shoelessone> DeManDinG: $("textarea").bind("focus", function(event){}); maybe?
[22:46:14] <shoelessone> xp_prg: not sure what you mean by this exactly..
[22:46:55] <coldhead> heya SIDU
[22:47:05] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: why use .bind()? why not $('textarea').focus(function(e){});?
[22:47:08] <xp_prg> <a href="http://www.example/data.php">This takes content using ajax</a>
[22:47:10] <xp_prg> I mean this
[22:47:25] <xp_prg> I am confused how data.php needs to be coded for this to work in fancybox
[22:47:37] <xp_prg> what is it expecting?
[22:48:27] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: nevermind, its the same thing. how do you check on defocus?
[22:49:13] <xp_prg> >1 shoes, can you assist? :>
[22:51:13] <chs> hellow how use jquery conflict
[23:11:36] <xp_prg> ok, I don't think that ajax call is what I want as that loads the actual content, not the list of images for fancybox to use
[23:11:41] <shoelessone> xp_prg: what is the issue again?
[23:11:45] <chs> how use jquery conflict
[23:12:11] <xp_prg> well I want to dynamically get the list of images that either lightbox or fancybox will show
[23:12:31] <shoelessone> chs: you mean no conflict?
[23:12:53] <shoelessone> xp_prg: ok, I guess that obviously really depends on your setup. You need help with your PHP?
[23:13:05] <chs> yes
[23:13:13] <chs> i try to change $ var
[23:13:25] <chs> but its not work
[23:13:48] <xp_prg> well I need help with the basics of understanding what is required, should I populate a hidden div with the lightbox href's then cause jQuery to click on the first one to show the images etc... ?
[23:14:17] <shoelessone> $.noConflict();
[23:14:17] <shoelessone>   jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[23:14:17] <shoelessone>     // Code that uses jQuery's $ can follow here.
[23:14:19] <shoelessone>   });
[23:14:31] <xp_prg> can I make lightbox load a set of images in some dynamix way via ajax?
[23:14:45] <shoelessone> you're using lightbox or fancybox?
[23:15:33] <xp_prg> well i am using lightbox currently but thought fancybox would help me more with this dynamic ajax approach but it doesn't appear to be helping the way I thought it would, it just takes the ajax pure content and shows it, it doesn't parse like an array for the images to show or anything
[23:15:40] <xp_prg> in short I am using lightbox
[23:17:37] <DeManDinG> how to check if something doesn't have focus?
[23:17:50] <DeManDinG> e.g. in a textarea?
[23:18:39] <shoelessone> blur?
[23:18:50] <shoelessone> you mean the event when you loose focus, or you want to check a textearea to see if it is current focused?
[23:18:53] <DeManDinG> blur?
[23:19:10] <shoelessone> well, there is an event, I believe it's onblur, which is when something looses focus
[23:19:35] <shoelessone> say you are typing in a textarea, and then you click outside of the textarea, that fires "onblur" i think... actually I feel like I'm partially wrong, but generally right
[23:19:45] <zilly> I'm trying to position element foo over element bar.  Using foo's offset and offsetWidth works fine for the x position, but, for some reason, the offsetHeight for foo is always 0, so it doesn't work in the y position.  Is there a way around this?
[23:19:51] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: im using focus to check if textarea has focus. so when user losses focus i think i might use onblur?
[23:21:52] <shoelessone> well, you might try something like $("textarea").blur(function(){ alert("CLICKED OUT!!!"); }
[23:22:20] <shoelessone> xp_prg: well, I'm still not totally sure I understand. If you have a bunch of images, that you want a fancybox gallery for, why use ajax?
[23:22:23] <shoelessone> are they changing or something?
[23:23:01] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: actually i want something different than focus() more like when someone enters text in textarea?
[23:23:20] <xp_prg> basically I am dealing with end users, they are not comfortable putting in a bunch of href's for all the images lightbox should show, so I want to simplify this by using ajax to get the images for lightbox to show
[23:23:24] <xp_prg> does that make sense?
[23:25:29] <DeManDinG> so if anyone knows how to trigger an event when user enters text in textarea please let me know.
[23:27:56] <shoelessone> keyup?
[23:28:40] <shoelessone> $("textarea").bind("keyup", function(event){ alert("A KEY WAS PRESSED IN A TEXT AREA!!!"); }
[23:28:40] <shoelessone> ?
[23:28:54] <shoelessone> ));
[23:30:34] <shoelessone> xp_prg: sorry, I'm tired, I might be totally off. Why would an end user put in hrefs?
[23:31:04] <xp_prg> that is how lightbox knows what images to show, its ok, get some rest
[23:31:51] <shoelessone> I mean, in your php: foreach($imageResource as $image){ echo "<img href='$image' alt='' />";}
[23:31:53] <shoelessone> right?
[23:32:05] <shoelessone> all wrapped in a div or something?
[23:32:12] <shoelessone> or however lightbox works?
[23:33:03] <xp_prg> right, and then I would have to tell the browser to click on the first href
[23:33:56] <shoelessone> so, you want the lightbox to open by itself, without the user having to click on the link?
[23:34:17] <shoelessone> so like, in the image gallery in this example, you don't want to ahve to click on the image?
[23:34:17] <shoelessone> http://fancybox.net/
[23:34:19] <shoelessone> ?
[23:34:24] <xp_prg> no, I want them to click on an image actually and then have it go get the images and show them
[23:35:00] <xp_prg> shoelessone I want them to click one image and not have to enter in all the hrefs for all the images for lightbox to show!!!!
[23:37:16] <shoelessone> so, I know this is getting frusterating for you, sorry!, but on the facybox.net example, how is this different from what you want?
[23:37:24] <shoelessone> i mean, you don't have to have the thumbnails show up
[23:37:35] <shoelessone> so if you want a single image, click the image and you get a gallery with multiple images, that's possible
[23:37:52] <shoelessone> in the xample on fancybox.net they have three thumbnails that are visible
[23:38:01] <shoelessone> but again, you could only show a single thumbnail
[23:38:14] <shoelessone> the php would be the same, and spit out only the first thumbnail
[23:39:01] <xp_prg> ok, lets make it soooooooo simple for you to understand:  <a href="server.com?imagegroup=vacation">click here to see fancybox show</a>
[23:39:11] <xp_prg> that is all I want to put on the page, not all the images or anything
[23:39:41] <shoelessone> ah
[23:39:50] <shoelessone> you own server.com? ;)
[23:39:54] <xp_prg> SHOELESSONE BUT ON THE PAGE THE OTHER IMAGES ARE SHOWING, HOW HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND THIS SIMPLE IDEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[23:40:07] <xp_prg> they are in the html!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[23:40:28] <xp_prg> pours gasoline on himself
[23:40:28] <coldhead> that's quite enough capslocking chuck
[23:40:45] <xp_prg> looks in delight as he gets matches
[23:42:44] <shoelessone> if that's all you want, I'm sure it's possible with a tiny bit of work ;)
[23:42:51] <shoelessone> but, let's see..
[23:42:56] <xp_prg> well I am trying to figure it out
[23:48:28] <shoelessone> well, I guess my simple thought is to just use normal jquery ajax functions to get in the images from the server, stick them in a hidden div or something, then fire off fancybox on the div
[23:49:13] <xp_prg> well I am ok with that, my problem is how do I tell ajax to be called with a simple href?
[23:49:26] <xp_prg> by the way I am using lightbox not fancybox
[23:49:41] <xp_prg> I only wanted to use fancybox if it could do this thing outright, but it can't so I don't want it now
[23:51:47] <shoelessone> somethign liek http://jsfiddle.net/psE2w/1/
[23:51:50] <DeManDinG> how to check if keydown() is already triggered?
[23:52:34] <shoelessone> DeManDinG: huh? why would you want that?
[23:52:39] <DeManDinG> i got $('textarea').keydown(function(){$(this).empty;);
[23:52:54] <DeManDinG> otherwise everytime i enter a key it empties textarea
[23:53:02] <xp_prg> wow that is quite elegant
[23:53:27] <DeManDinG> i have default text in textarea like "enter a text"
[23:53:40] <shoelessone> ok, and you want to automatically clear when you start typing?
[23:53:43] <xp_prg> I have a dumb question, is it possible to add to $(function() { without having to alter the function manually?
[23:53:51] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: bingo
[23:54:02] <xp_prg> well it has a close little x on the right right so that is good enough
[23:54:35] <xp_prg> shoelessone does this create the hiddendiv to?
[23:55:22] <shoelessone> no, in this example you'd have to make the div before hand. also, i have no idea how lightbox or fancybox work, so that call might be different. I know that fancybox lets you trigger it on the fly though, so it should work,
[23:55:44] <shoelessone> honestly though, that's probably way off, but it's a general idea I guess
[23:55:55] <shoelessone> of one, possibly somewhat primitive way to do it.
[23:55:59] <xp_prg> well, its alot close then I was
[23:56:06] <xp_prg> thanks!!!!!
[23:56:15] <shoelessone> no worries man!
[23:56:19] <xp_prg> forgive my yelling, just seemed obvious what I wanted to do
[23:56:20] <shoelessone> DeManDinG: I think you might have a difficult time doing this without checking for text
[23:56:26] <shoelessone> no worries, I understand the feeling!
[23:56:46] <shoelessone> so, before emptying check to see if the text matches the default you had places
[23:58:10] <shoelessone> so, something like, "$("textarea").keydown(function(){ if($(this).val() == "enter text here"){ $(this).val()="";}});
[23:58:12] <shoelessone> or something
[23:58:48] <shoelessone> that doesn't seem very efficient though, there's probably a better way
[23:59:46] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: actually, better if you check if textarea is empty then do not empty text area on keydown
