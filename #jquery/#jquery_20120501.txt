[00:36:37] <LukeNukem> she cant*
[00:37:13] <LukeNukem> if you were selling crack then what the fuck youd stop for dummy, youd make a whole lot more money than youd do from rap
[00:37:38] <hyperstream> lololol
[00:38:18] <hyperstream> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_%22the_Muss%22_Heke
[00:38:21] <hyperstream> some good quote ^_^
[00:38:55] <LukeNukem> jake the muss what the fuck
[00:43:24] <ravenzz> so
[00:43:56] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/cQRrb/3/ why when the UL is created from the select the attributes aren't added?
[00:44:21] <ravenzz> I don't get why when I create a new jQuery object data() doesn't work on it
[00:44:43] <ravenzz> eg var foo = $('<div/>').data({ foo : 'bar' });
[00:51:04] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, what do you think foo is going to return?
[00:51:52] <ravenzz> :?
[00:52:35] <Whirl3d> s question mark?
[00:53:22] <Whirl3d> if you did console.log(foo)    given your previous statement, what would you get
[00:54:02] <LukeNukem> Why dont you just do .append :P
[00:55:37] <qvarkk> Can someone give me a hint on what to search for if I want a drag'n'drop function to order items in a list?
[00:56:00] <Whirl3d> jquery UI
[00:56:12] <Whirl3d> without a doubt. Look up JqueryUI sortable
[00:56:49] <qvarkk> Whirl3d: thanks!
[01:00:54] <coldhead> you know i can't grab your ghost chip
[01:26:35] <cheshair> Hi! I have those two JS snippet: http://dpaste.com/740739/ . First snippet: expande/collapse rows of a table. Second snippet: show fancybox (popup) image when clicking on an anchor tag
[01:27:02] <cheshair> the point is that when clicking the anchor tag I want the row is not collapsed again
[01:27:20] <cheshair> sorry, that English sucks!
[01:27:31] <cheshair> I'll try again
[01:28:18] <cheshair> whenever I click the fancybox anchor the image is shown and the relative table row is closed
[01:28:27] <cheshair> i don't want that behaviour
[01:28:48] <cheshair> when clicking on the anchor tag I don't want the row to be collapsed
[01:29:07] <cheshair> so, I must tell fancybox not to "propagate"
[01:29:28] <cheshair> any tips?
[01:31:49] <Axsuul> Is there any way I can create a jquery object from an array of DOM elements?
[01:32:02] <thomas____> how do I find out which properties on the window object were set by the browser, and which were set by a site ?
[01:33:31] <Whirl3d> cheshair, in the handler for your anchor element, use return false or e.preventDefault();
[01:35:33] <diverdude> How can i align these boxes horizontally instead of vertically? http://jsfiddle.net/Sm2tb/3/ and wrap when total width of 400 px is reached?
[01:41:09] <cheshair> Whirl3d: I'll try right now, thank you very much for the tip
[01:41:43] <macobo> Hello. Suppose I have a element where I want to make it possible to for user to define their own handler in html (similar to how onclick and etc works), how should I approach this?
[01:42:05] <macobo> I have code that handles the element and should be able to call the handler when neccesary.
[01:42:32] <macobo> I was thinking of using data-.. defines, but is there any way to convert the string into a method name without eval?
[01:45:08] <cheshair> Whirl3d: I added a "$("a.popup").click(function() {return false;})" and everything works fine!! Thank you so much!!  http://dpaste.com/740745/ Do you think this is cross browser compliant?
[01:45:52] <cheshair> Whirl3d: works fine in FF and Chrome, but I am concerned with IE, of course... :-)
[01:46:12] * cheshair doesn't have any IE to test against
[01:47:01] <macobo> cheshair: http://browsershots.org/
[01:48:31] <cheshair> macobo: thank you very much, that will help. However, I thought that was pretty much about CSS testing rather than JS
[01:49:20] <macobo> Hmm... Didn't think of that.
[01:50:08] <macobo> Anyways, if you're serious about worrying about cross-browser compability, you could use a virtual machine. :)
[01:54:51] <Whirl3d> cheshair, sorry, I was away for a mniute. Glad you got it working. I don't see why it wouldn't work in ie. If you have chrome, you can download a plugin called ie tab. It uses the IE engine within chrome. It'll at least givbe you some idea.
[01:56:46] <Whirl3d> diverdude, only one element can have an ID. If you set the same ID on two elements, it will break the browser. That being said, you will never get those boxes aligned.
[01:57:45] <diverdude> Whirl3d: why not
[01:58:07] <huntedmitch> diverdude: So you just want them to go across the page instead of down the page?
[01:59:21] <Whirl3d> if you have two elements with the same id, it doesn't work.
[01:59:30] <huntedmitch> diverdude: 1. Change your ID's to classes. 2. Go learn about the effect of widths/marging/paddings on the outer width of an object.
[01:59:30] <Whirl3d> IDs have to be unique
[02:00:14] <Whirl3d> and diverdude, come on. That's not a jquery question anyways. Try #css
[02:00:29] <diverdude> huntedmitch: yes
[02:01:44] <huntedmitch> Whirl3d: But he put it on jsFiddle ;-P
[02:01:59] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:17:48] <ravenzz> do someone know a jQuery plugin that do this http://jsfiddle.net/cQRrb/7/ (incomplete) ? it basically should transform a multiple select into an UL and when I click an item (option) it will be moved to a "selected" UL
[02:17:59] <ravenzz> and vice versa
[02:18:11] <ravenzz> I thought that it was simple to code :\
[02:25:23] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, so you want an unorder list of elements that when you click on one element it selects the element and moves it to another ul
[02:26:28] <ravenzz> yep
[02:27:03] <ravenzz> basically something like this http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/ but with the optgroups support
[02:31:14] <luyang> I do AJAX with jQuery every 2 seconds to generate game events in the MySql Database
[02:31:55] <luyang> But if I scale this game to become multiplayer, then this ajax model doesn't work. I guess I would have to schedule a singleton of some sort to poll a url which makes the db updates? Any ideas?
[02:32:56] <sgronblom> Is there a way to inspect a custom jquery ui DL to see which components it includes?
[02:34:06] <Dr-Bombay> DL?
[02:39:39] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, here is the beginning of what you need, I think: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/cQRrb/12/
[02:40:28] <Whirl3d> It at least shows one way to convert a select element to a UL. the problem is that you have multiple levels of options in your selects, which adds complexity.
[02:41:36] <Whirl3d> And since you are doing the conversion on dom ready, there will enver be a "selected" UL made. So you will have to handle the click event and on the first click, create the ul for selected and detatch the item, append it to the new ul
[02:42:45] <nFFF> what? :Z
[02:43:01] <Whirl3d> luyang, that sounds like a server issue, not a front-end issue. You need php or something, I would guess..
[02:43:31] <nFFF> if you want to move an li to a new <ul> when you click
[02:43:43] <nFFF> is simple :|
[02:43:48] <nFFF> why do you need to detach?
[02:45:19] <Dr-Bombay> sgronblom: the widget method gives you the dialog's parent element I think
[02:46:56] <sgronblom> I mean if you have a jquery.ui.min.custom.xyz.js file, is there a way to see which components are packaged in it?
[02:47:29] <r3za> hi guys , does anyone know what jquery script make this kind of menu ? http://i.imgur.com/RIu9F.jpg
[02:47:29] <r3za> please help
[02:47:41] <nFFF> lol
[02:47:42] <nFFF> :>
[02:49:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/cQRrb/13/
[02:49:01] <r3za> hi guys , does anyone know what jquery script make this kind of menu ? http://i.imgur.com/RIu9F.jpg
[02:49:24] <Whirl3d> you don't have to detach. I was thinking figuratively, really. You can just append
[02:49:36] <huntedmitch> r3za: Heard you the first time. This is jQuery support, not a bunch of people who will google plugins for you.
[02:50:09] <Dr-Bombay> r3za: that's called a flyout menu. nobody said there was a script for it, but you can try searching one now that you know what it's called
[02:50:16] <huntedmitch> Having said thatâ€¦ google "suckerfish" "superfish" etc.
[02:50:30] <r3za> huntedmitch: i dont anyone to google plugins for me , i just want to know if there is anyone know this plugin
[02:52:27] <Whirl3d> huntedmitch, there is a value to asking live people to do your googling for you. And that is that they might have the experience that you are lacking with the subject at hand. Looking through 3 million plugins that claim to do the same thing is a real bitch. When, in the same amount of time that you spent smarting off, you could have answered the question with your own experience and everyone
[02:52:27] <Whirl3d> would have benefitted.
[02:53:05] <Whirl3d> but that's just my soapbox.
[02:53:18] <Mohsen_Hassani> When I click on a checkbox, it won't get unchecked. I'm using jquery for only knowing if the checkbox is checked.
[02:53:34] <Whirl3d> When I ask for help for something that is obviously google-able, it's not just the result I want, it's the optinions of these folks that I value.
[02:54:00] <Whirl3d> ? demo @ Mohsen_Hassani
[02:54:00] <bot-t1> Mohsen_Hassani, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:54:59] <huntedmitch> Whirl3d: Yeah, true enough. And it's not like I've never asked for plugin advice. It's more the spamming and "please help" comments.
[02:55:16] <Whirl3d> Trust me, I am right there with ya
[02:55:31] <Whirl3d> Or the #CSS issues. GAWD I hate CSS. LOL
[02:55:37] <nFFF> lol its the way r3za asks
[02:56:03] <nFFF> clearly doesnt give a fuck about learning anything to do with jquery
[02:56:10] <nFFF> but thats just an assumption :D
[02:56:19] <Whirl3d> I think it's a language barrier.
[02:57:09] <nFFF> perhaps :>
[02:57:12] <Whirl3d> I am still amazed at how many people speak English around the world. I'm American and just dumb as dirt when it comes to foreign languages. I can speak some French, but not enough to ask for help in an irc channel
[02:57:37] <Whirl3d> Even with Google translate...lol
[02:57:59] <sgronblom> I only speak a couple of languages :)
[02:59:21] <Whirl3d> languages are so important. If I had had kids, they would all be polyglots.
[03:00:39] <sgronblom> So is there any way to list available jquery ui components? If you have a custom min DL.
[03:01:33] <Whirl3d> you could look at the source, and try to reformat it, but I don't really know of any way to figure it out in advance.
[03:01:48] <sgronblom> Well I think learning languages can be really interesting too.
[03:01:50] <Whirl3d> Maybe you could create every size of every combination and check the sizes
[03:02:10] <sgronblom> haha i dont think i will
[03:02:22] <Whirl3d> ya, don't blame ya. LOL
[03:03:16] <sgronblom> you'd think there would be some $.ui_components() function or something
[03:04:07] <sgronblom> But you'd also think this should be a common problem when people upgrade their jqueries?
[03:07:33] <cheshair> Whirl3d: ie tab? sounds nice, but you must be using windows, which I am not :-)
[03:08:39] <Dr-Bombay> sgronblom: does for(componentName in $.ui) give you anything?
[03:09:24] <sgronblom> ah well looking at $.ui gives me an indication. thanks.
[03:41:35] <onats> hi guys, I'm trying to setup loading images once its visible on screen. is there a facility like this available in jquery?
[03:51:39] <Whirl3d> cheshair, I wonder if Adobe's browserlab would help?
[03:52:50] <cheshair> Whirl3d: I have heard of it but never tried. You reminded me of it, thanks!
[03:53:27] <sunbeam> In many sites you currently see that the header servers as an iframe (eg. the header will stay on the same location) - is there some easy way that i can use to achieve this behavior?

[04:06:45] <superdmp> greetings #jquery - I'm hoping for some advice on how to solve an IE7 rendering issue at http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/slider-test/ (select the middle image to see what I mean)
[04:07:20] <superdmp> in IE7, no amount of CSS fiddling will get the yellow anchors above the image but below the white text box in the z-axis
[04:07:57] <superdmp> I can think of a few approaches to solving this, but what do you think would be best?
[04:08:13] <superdmp> (it's fine if the solution tackles IE7 only or is a more general one)
[04:08:17] <superdmp> I could:
[04:08:38] <superdmp> a) use JS to adjust the place of the yellow anchors in the z-axis
[04:08:57] <superdmp> b) use JS to make them no taller than the img
[04:09:14] <superdmp> suggestions and advice very gratefully received

[06:05:38] <dn123> hi
[06:06:31] <dn123> i have a little question, someone knows if is possible to handle the events from a input file,  like the close event?
[06:08:27] <NodeX> not in all browsers properly
[06:09:02] <NodeX> you can track focus though or change which can happen when someone selected a file and changed the value of the input field
[06:09:54] <dn123> hmm thx,  i will try with focus...
[06:13:58] <christo_m> hi, does anyone have any experience with forms in nyromodal?
[06:14:32] <christo_m> im trying to close after a saveall, ive tried using $.nmTop().close() and it hangs
[06:14:58] <christo_m> when i put console.logs in i see my inline script is getting executed.. ive tried self.close, ive tried firing a click event on the closeButton element, to no avail.
[06:15:54] <christo_m> i can .hide() the whole nyroModal div, or .remove() it, but then im unable to open another one after that without a refresh
[06:16:04] <christo_m> meaning i need to kill it somehow in js
[06:17:00] <shabble> if I'm fetching a <form> fragment via .ajax, and it needs some setting up (adding to dom, binding .submit, etc), what's the most sensible way to bundle those parameters along with the fragment?
[06:17:20] <shabble> I've been using a <script>var setup={ blah };</script> in the partial, but I'm not sure that's the best
[06:17:22] <christo_m> http://code.google.com/p/nyromodal/issues/detail?id=572

[06:50:43] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: can  you explain what you're intending to happen?
[06:52:19] <jonathancutrell> Hello all.
[06:52:39] <ravenzz> I need to trasform a multiselect in a kind of drag and drop lists, (it is click and drop or something like that). so every time I click an element it is hidden from the left list and shown in the right one. At the same time i should update the select value
[06:52:47] <jonathancutrell> Quick question to those who are familiar with the changes .on() brought (vs .live() )
[06:53:01] <jonathancutrell> I have an example using 1.7.2 where .on() isn't working while .live() is working.
[06:53:07] <jrist> anyone heard of uploading a file into a text area? no server side processing?
[06:53:16] <jonathancutrell> I was under the impression that .on() was supposed to replace .live() ?
[06:53:22] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: it does, but parameter order is different
[06:53:31] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: so what is not working correctly in your fiddle?
[06:53:38] <silverwind> jonathancutrell, it's supposed to replace both .bind, .live and .delegate
[06:53:47] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.live
[06:53:50] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I've got .on("click", function(){ })
[06:53:57] <silverwind> jonathancutrell, .on has 2 different syntaxes.
[06:53:59] <silverwind> Err
[06:54:04] <johnkpaul> it has more :)
[06:54:10] <ravenzz> johnkpaul I don't know how can I set the values for the current select
[06:54:23] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: the only way I figure it out, is by checking the source for .bind(), .delegate() and .live()
[06:54:29] <johnkpaul> because they all delegate to live
[06:54:42] <johnkpaul> and they're one-liners so they're easily understood
[06:54:42] <silverwind> to .on you mean?
[06:55:16] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: So basically you'd do something like $(body).on("click", someElement, function(){ //do stuff });
[06:55:25] <johnkpaul> silverwind: yes
[06:55:33] <jonathancutrell> where someElement is the clicked element.
[06:56:00] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: https://gist.github.com/1749717
[06:56:11] <johnkpaul> that's actually a better recommendation than the source, I should use that

[06:57:54] <johnkpaul> I was so sure the command was learn
[06:58:04] <jonathancutrell> Well,
[06:58:09] <jonathancutrell> I don't mind reading, fellas. Calm down.
[06:58:11] <kr|afk> How can I make jQuery $("myDiv").addClass("active") to use #myDiv.active {} instead of .active {}?
[06:58:20] <quicksilver> johnkpaul: such people can stop pretending to be programmers and move on to a rewarding career in the fast food industry? :)
[06:58:21] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: that wasn't directed at you, it's just a comment in general
[06:58:31] <jonathancutrell> Haha. Fair enough.
[06:58:36] <johnkpaul> quicksilver: eh, most of them aren't "programmers"
[06:58:48] <johnkpaul> most of them are people that need to get their paycheck and need to finish some work to get paid
[06:59:05] <johnkpaul> in general though, I agree with you
[06:59:07] <quicksilver> indeed :)
[06:59:25] <johnkpaul> ?teach
[06:59:26] <bot-t> johnkpaul, #4976 (qunit: allow enabling the noglobal option in code) – jQuery ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4976
[06:59:27] <jonathancutrell> Either way, it seems like the scope should be implied to be body if it's not identified?
[06:59:31] <jonathancutrell> perhaps not.
[06:59:57] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: the whole point of .on is to make those things explicit
[07:00:44] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: seems to me like $(element).on("click", function(){ })  should always map to the correct function; Maybe my thinking is broken.
[07:01:03] <quicksilver> jonathancutrell: well that does do something reasonable.
[07:01:07] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean if you wanted to use it like .bind(), not like .live()?
[07:01:08] <quicksilver> just not the thing you wanted, in this case.
[07:01:25] <jonathancutrell> because that's different thinking than $(scope).on("click", element, function(){ })
[07:02:50] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Just seems to make sense to delegate all events to body unless they are specified.
[07:03:11] <jonathancutrell> (use "live" delegated to body by default)
[07:03:19] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: there's overhead that comes from that fanciness
[07:03:27] <johnkpaul> you should excplitly opt-in to live like behavior
[07:03:29] <ravenzz> johnkpaul take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/GpX2t/14/ ..pick some values from the list and then submit and take a look at the console
[07:03:32] <johnkpaul> not only is there overhead, there are also cons
[07:03:43] <johnkpaul> if jquery did that by default, you'd be giving up al ot of useful functionality, jonathancutrell
[07:04:18] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Yeah that makes sense. Maybe combining into .on() is the problem I have with it.
[07:04:44] <johnkpaul> they are already combined into on(), they are just one line wrappers
[07:05:05] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: ah ok.
[07:05:17] <johnkpaul> I'm sure someone on jquery core would have a better thought out opinion than me, but I'm sure it's a common debate for library designers
[07:05:34] <johnkpaul> do you make things more complicated and give more power, or make things simpler and gloss over potential issues
[07:05:40] <johnkpaul> in this case, they chose to give the power to the people
[07:06:16] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: It's not a bad option, surely. It just requires less semantic code, and more reference to the docs.
[07:06:26] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: ah, so it duplicaes the value for some reason?
[07:06:32] <ravenzz> yes
[07:06:33] <jonathancutrell> .on() doesn't tell me what .live() tells me.
[07:06:33] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: that's only baceuse you're used to live :)
[07:06:52] <johnkpaul> eh, I don't know if I agree, jonathancutrell, when you first learned live, if you had learned about on() it would have been fine
[07:06:58] <johnkpaul> it's like $.ajax
[07:07:02] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: No, it's because .live, .click, etc are more semantic than .on
[07:07:09] <johnkpaul> it's unbelievably powerful and can be configured to do anything
[07:07:09] <jonathancutrell> at least .click is
[07:07:18] <johnkpaul> but you probably learned $.ajax earlier on, IMHO
[07:07:18] <jonathancutrell> Well, that's fair and true.
[07:07:37] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: where in your code are you setting your value, I wish jsfiddle had line numbers
[07:07:50] <jonathancutrell> I think the issue is that the arguments aren't semantic, and there is more than one configuration for arguments.
[07:08:32] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: yeah, taht's a fair critique, I have wished that they used an options object sometimes, but you do get used to it, and it was the same as live or delegate, you still had to know the parameter order in your head
[07:08:33] <ravenzz> johnkpaul me either, anyway at the bottom self.closest('form').submit(
[07:09:19] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: so you're setting the selected value to an array?
[07:09:26] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Yeah. I know I'll get used to it. Just one of those things you have to remember, or have the docs nearby, I suppose. Such is programming.
[07:09:53] <ravenzz> johnkpaul yes? isn't the value property of multiple selectboxes an array?
[07:10:01] <MikeH> What happens if you set the .val() of a select to a value that isn't already an option?
[07:12:56] <johnkpaul> so, ravenzz, I see your problem, but I don't have an immediate solution, my first thought is that you are trying to set the value of a select box to an array rather than a string
[07:13:06] <[ric]> guys, got a little problem with the .fadeIn and .fadeOut methods
[07:13:10] <johnkpaul> MikeH: I don't know, you should try it, I'd assume that it does nothing
[07:13:20] <[ric]> .fadeOut works fine triggering the callback after the effect has finished
[07:13:24] <johnkpaul> because .val() on selects goes through the options and sets the "selected" property on one of them
[07:13:35] <[ric]> the .fadeIn triggers the callback immediately and doesn't run the effect
[07:13:46] <[ric]> I have examples online if anyone cares to have a quick look
[07:14:08] <johnkpaul> [ric]: yes, please send a jsfiddle or something
[07:14:13] <ravenzz> johnkpaul I'll do a tiny test setting the values by hand
[07:14:22] <[ric]> http://www.vantasticjourney.com/test/fadeIn.html || www.vantasticjourney.com/test/fadeOut.html
[07:14:41] <[ric]> not sure what a jsfiddle is, but that is identical pages, simply using differtent methods
[07:14:55] <[ric]> the .fadeOut seems happy enough to play
[07:15:03] <[ric]> .fadeIn just dicks me about
[07:15:29] <kr|afk> How can I make el.addClass("active") using #el .active {} ?
[07:15:55] <quicksilver> do you mean #el .active or #el.active
[07:15:57] <pachet> kr|afk: huh
[07:15:59] <quicksilver> quite different.
[07:16:19] <quicksilver> #el.active is higher precendence than .active, so it should work.
[07:16:20] <johnkpaul> [ric]: it's already faded in
[07:16:26] <quicksilver> as long as you don' thave a space there.
[07:16:34] <johnkpaul> so it will fire immediately because there's no time to fade
[07:16:42] <[ric]> johnkpaul: ok, so how do I set it to be unfaded at the beginning?
[07:16:56] <kr|afk> quicksilver: Thank you :-)
[07:16:57] <[ric]> .css({"opacity":0}) ?
[07:17:12] <kr|afk> quicksilver: I forgot the whitespace... Didn't know that there's a difference
[07:17:21] <johnkpaul> [ric]: yes, you shoudl try that
[07:17:26] <johnkpaul> also, you can use jquery itself to create dom elements
[07:17:26] <quicksilver> kr|afk: #el .active with space means "elements with class active somewhere inside #el"
[07:17:41] <quicksilver> kr|afk: for example <div id="el"><span class="active">....
[07:17:44] <johnkpaul> [ric]: $("<div class='Test2'></div>").appendTo("#Test1)
[07:17:52] <kr|afk> quicksilver: Yap, but what does the other mean?
[07:18:11] <ravenzz> johnkpaul wtf ?! http://jsfiddle.net/akJEc/  select more than one option with CTRL
[07:18:27] <quicksilver> kr|afk: without a space #el.active means "elements with ID el and class active"
[07:18:35] <pachet> (which is redundant)
[07:18:50] <pachet> (well... zzz)
[07:19:00] <kr|afk> quicksilver: I see. Thanks a lot!
[07:19:14] <ravenzz> its type is an Object but console.dir displays an Array :|
[07:19:21] <CraniumSlows> Hi. Is it necessary to unregister click events registered with the $.click() function ?
[07:19:33] <pachet> necessary in what sense?
[07:20:01] <CraniumSlows> I may be creating and destroying elemeents with a .click() applied to it many times
[07:20:03] <kr|afk> quicksilver: Should I use :active instead of .active? (I tried the pseudo class but it didnt work...)
[07:20:15] <pachet> jquery removes all events that you attach (using jquery) whenever you remove them
[07:20:30] <quicksilver> kr|afk: probably not.
[07:20:39] <CraniumSlows> thanks pachet i wasn't sure if it paid attention or not
[07:20:50] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: hm, I don't know
[07:20:59] <johnkpaul> I need to head out, but I can help more later
[07:21:05] <ravenzz> pachet are the events removed from detach() as well?
[07:21:14] <CraniumSlows> good call
[07:21:15] <ravenzz> johnkpaul-afk np, thank you mate
[07:21:32] <pachet> ravenzz: no
[07:21:54] <ravenzz> okk
[07:22:34] <ravenzz> pachet can you help me to figure out why I get duplicated values in here ? http://jsfiddle.net/GpX2t/14/ pick some elements from the list and then submit
[07:22:39] <ravenzz> and take a look at the console
[07:22:56] <pachet> ?src cleanData
[07:22:56] <bot-t> Line#6235 - "cleanData: function( elems ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6235
[07:23:15] <pachet> ^re: event ( and other data ) removal
[07:27:26] <[ric]> johnkpaul-afk: I realise you are away, just wanted to thank you for your help (it was an issue with the display css property needing to be set)
[07:27:30] <[ric]> bye all.. :)
[07:28:23] <tehOPEologist> shoky, you here today mang?  ^_^
[07:29:58] <pachet> ravenzz: the goal is to have them print the same values?
[07:30:56] <_zoggy_> hmm odd
[07:31:26] <ravenzz> pachet if you look at the console you can see that when I collect them I have the correct ones, but when I set the select value to this collection
[07:31:38] <_zoggy_> jquery 1.8.20, ui-sortable drop target no longer shows the height of the item like before
[07:31:49] <ravenzz> it duplicate the values
[07:31:50] <mayhem93> hey there
[07:32:05] <mayhem93> i'm looking for some one who was a good working experience with jQuery UI
[07:32:13] <mayhem93> i want to ask something about autocomplete
[07:32:54] <ravenzz> pachet search for self.closest('form').submit(function(e) in the fiddle
[07:36:39] <mayhem93> crap... no one
[07:37:12] <ajpiano> mayhem93: ask your question directly
[07:38:06] <mayhem93> in autocomplete when you specify the data source, you actually pass as a copy and it doesn't work well when the actuall data source is dynamic
[07:38:13] <mayhem93> what's the workaround for this ?
[07:38:28] <mayhem93> my data source is just an array of strings
[07:39:25] <ajpiano> what do you mean "you actually pass a copy"
[07:39:45] <ajpiano> mayhem93: when you have a dynamic data source the typical approach is to use source: function(request, response) { } syntax
[07:40:06] <mayhem93> ah ok, i was thinking of that
[07:41:52] <tehOPEologist> can you use .find() to locate a regex in an img src within a div that's selected and then use that found string to have css display: block a div that has the same name?
[07:42:49] <tehOPEologist> i basically have a page setup so that an employee's name is the name of a png
[07:43:08] <ravenzz> so you want to match a pattern? and get its name?
[07:43:15] <ravenzz> his
[07:43:19] <tehOPEologist> i want jquery to get the employee's name from that file's name in the <img src="blah/employee.png" />
[07:43:48] <tehOPEologist> this is what i was thinking, but i'm sorta stuck
[07:43:49] <tehOPEologist> var employee = $(this).find('img');
[07:43:49] <tehOPEologist> 		img.attr('src').find(
[07:44:20] <tehOPEologist> not sure if find can actually get the string from the filename
[07:44:23] <ajpiano> tehOPEologist: .find is not a string method, you use normal string methods
[07:44:26] <ajpiano> when you have the filename string
[07:44:36] <tehOPEologist> could you elaborate for me?
[07:44:40] <ravenzz> var imageSrc = $('img').attr('src');
[07:44:50] <ravenzz> and then you can use match()
[07:44:53] <ravenzz> on that one
[07:44:53] <ajpiano> ^^
[07:45:05] <tehOPEologist> hmm
[07:45:17] <tehOPEologist> lemme toy around with that..  are ya'll gonna be around for a while?
[07:46:07] <ravenzz> maybe
[07:46:12] <tehOPEologist> lol
[07:46:59] <tehOPEologist> the jquery documentation doesn't have any info on .match()...
[07:47:01] <tehOPEologist> :(
[07:47:12] <ravenzz> because it is a js function
[07:47:16] <quicksilver> ?mdn match
[07:47:16] <tehOPEologist> ah
[07:47:17] <bot-t> quicksilver, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[07:47:21] <quicksilver> !
[07:47:22] <ravenzz> cool
[07:47:23] <mayhem93> xD
[07:47:26] <quicksilver> that's now what I thought it would do :P
[07:47:30] <ravenzz> ?g match mdn
[07:47:31] <bot-t> ravenzz, match - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[07:47:36] <quicksilver> :)
[07:47:53] <tehOPEologist> word, thanks, i'll take a look at that
[07:48:22] <ravenzz> last attempt for today
[07:48:42] <ravenzz> so I have this fancy select http://jsfiddle.net/GpX2t/14/ that I am starting to hate.
[07:49:11] <ravenzz> when I submit the form the select value has duplicated values
[07:49:42] <ravenzz> you can see it in action picking some value up from the list and submitting the form
[07:50:02] <ravenzz> and taking a look at the console of course
[07:50:36] <tehOPEologist> shit, i forgot how bad i was at creating regex's -_-;;;  rofl been a while >_<
[07:51:43] <ravenzz> tehOPEologist another (less safe) approach could be to slit the filename by /
[07:51:50] <ravenzz> and get the last part
[07:52:34] <tehOPEologist> say i have a filename that's "thisemployeesname-active.png"  and i want to create a regex that gets the name of that employee, wouldn't it be something like [A-Za-z]*-active.png or some shit?
[07:52:58] <tehOPEologist> you can tell it to grab the string as far as it goes, up until the dash comes into play?
[07:53:34] <ravenzz> ([^-]+)
[07:53:45] <ravenzz> i don't remember if you have to escape the dash
[07:53:46] <mayhem93> is that a smiley?
[07:53:52] <ravenzz> lol
[07:53:56] <tehOPEologist> riiiiight, forgot the carot does everything before, right?
[07:54:12] <tehOPEologist> ummmmm i might have to..  lemme ask someone in the office who'd know
[07:54:14] <mayhem93> looks like a cyborg
[07:54:17] <mayhem93> good job bro
[07:55:02] <ravenzz> [LoTL] footfetish regex
[07:55:30] <jsabeaudry> I'm using .buttonset for radio buttons with jquery ui but the buttons wont click if there is the slightest movement of the mouse during clicking, anyone encountered that issue before?
[07:55:54] <ajpiano> tehOPEologist: there are numerous regex testing tools online, use one and you can interactively tweak your regex until you are happy with it
[07:56:16] <ravenzz> read the mdn doc before
[07:56:53] <ravenzz> ajpiano could you help me?
[07:57:03] <jsabeaudry> I suspect it is a matter of text selection or something, (however my whole page is user-select:none)
[07:57:10] <ajpiano> ravenzz: let's play make a deal
[07:57:17] <Iszak> did someone say regex?
[07:57:25] <ajpiano> ravenzz: if you go to the apartment i'm looking at right now and insert one extra room inbetween the bathroom and the bedroom so there's room for a piano and a desk
[07:57:27] <ajpiano> i will help you
[07:57:35] <ajpiano> :|
[07:57:37] <brianloveswords> ajpiano: I'LL DO IT!
[07:57:43] <ajpiano> brianloveswords: :DDD
[07:57:48] <Iszak> ajpiano: you should move to the country, more space.
[07:57:54] <ravenzz> Lul
[07:57:59] <ajpiano> mmk
[07:58:03] <ajpiano> ravenzz: whats your quesiton
[07:58:07] <ravenzz> my father is an architect he could help you btw :p
[07:58:20] <ravenzz> mmm can you scroll up a bit and read it?
[07:58:31] <Iszak> ..
[07:58:48] <ravenzz> I asked it 10 minutes ago or less than that
[07:58:53] <ajpiano> ok found it
[07:59:42] <ajpiano> ravenzz: so first thing is
[07:59:53] <ajpiano> whenever youre working with a multiselect and need the value
[08:00:07] <ajpiano> you always want to do var val = $("#foo").val() || [];
[08:00:08] <jeffsmykil> I have an array of objects.  Each object has a member called key.  I need to match that key and delete the object it belongs to from the array.  How can I search for the key value?
[08:00:33] <ajpiano> this way you *always* get an array back even if nothing is selected
[08:00:33] <RandalSchwartz> I'd use a grep
[08:00:35] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you can use grep
[08:00:36] <ajpiano> lol
[08:00:48] <silverwind> What a bad function name :/
[08:00:49] <ravenzz> okk
[08:01:04] <jeffsmykil> never used grep should i be scared
[08:01:13] <ravenzz> that make sense
[08:01:14] <silverwind> jeffsmykil, Nah, it's easy
[08:01:18] <RandalSchwartz> thank goodness John Resig was a Perl fan. :)
[08:01:25] <jeffsmykil> you obviously don't know me silverwind
[08:01:38] <Iszak> grep? use ack
[08:01:39] <silverwind> RandalSchwartz, He should rename the library to grepQuery then
[08:01:49] <silverwind> Or jGrepy
[08:01:55] <RandalSchwartz> jPerly :)
[08:02:23] <RandalSchwartz> it was fun when I interviewed him and he revealed that bit about perl
[08:02:28] <RandalSchwartz> big grin on my face
[08:02:43] <RandalSchwartz> jQuery is very perl-ish
[08:02:56] <mayhem93> sea perl ?
[08:03:09] <jeffsmykil> so grep can search objects inside of an array?
[08:03:19] <RandalSchwartz> grep transforms a list into another list
[08:03:33] <RandalSchwartz> the selection function decides whether to keep or discard an item
[08:03:36] <jsabeaudry> Anyone has a workaround for this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8191155/jquery-ui-buttonset-buttons-dont-always-work-on-first-click
[08:03:47] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[08:04:53] <tehOPEologist> mkay, so i've grabbed the string i need with this, i think:
[08:04:54] <tehOPEologist> var employee = $(this).find('img');
[08:04:54] <tehOPEologist> 		img.attr('src').match(/([^\-]+)-active.png$/i);
[08:05:17] <TeckniX> is there a way to trigger an event for opacity, something like: onOpacityChange ?
[08:05:18] <tehOPEologist> tested it in a regex tester, and it's successful
[08:05:34] <ajpiano> ravenzz: i can't really get into debugging right now, super busy :(
[08:05:43] <ravenzz> np
[08:05:53] <jeffsmykil> he's picking his fro!
[08:05:59] <tehOPEologist> so, can i just use (this) under the last line to use that string to call the div with the same name?
[08:06:15] <ravenzz> I am done for today, I will try to figure out what is going on there tomorrow
[08:06:21] <omnipotent1> Hi, I have a hover event that where the mouseleave event gets unbound on a click.  I wish to rebind the mouseleave event when the element is hovered over again.  How can I accomplish this?
[08:06:57] <BlaDe^> Hi guys... I have a <div> with a bunch of <articles> which are using masonry to become fluid
[08:07:44] <BlaDe^> let's imagine theres 3 articles 200px each with 10px padding either side i'm trying to make the search box 660px
[08:08:14] <BlaDe^> or, bacause their absolute I can do $('article')[3].style.left + width + padding for the width of the searchbox
[08:08:19] <BlaDe^> but i'm not sure how to detect there's 3 on the top row
[08:08:37] <BlaDe^> hope I explained that ok
[08:11:17] <BlaDe^> Another way to do it would be to get the highest "left" value of a collection of elements.. is that possible?
[08:12:41] <ajpiano> ?mdn Math.max @ BlaDe^
[08:12:43] <bot-t> BlaDe^, Elance | IOS Programmers - https://www.elance.com/d/p/ios/44
[08:12:47] <ajpiano> wtf
[08:12:53] <ajpiano> ?mdc Math.max
[08:12:54] <bot-t> ajpiano, Math.max - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns the largest of zero or more numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max
[08:13:09] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: Math.max.apply( Math, arrayOfNumbers ) will yield the largest number in the array
[08:14:21] <TeckniX> is there a way to trigger an event for opacity, something like: onOpacityChange ?
[08:18:40] <jeffsmykil> TeckniX: not that im aware of
[08:19:42] <TeckniX> jeffsmykil: that's what I was afraid of - thanks
[08:19:57] <jeffsmykil> you could do a wicked dirty hack
[08:19:59] <jeffsmykil> with settimeout
[08:20:03] <jeffsmykil> and constantly check the opacity
[08:20:24] <cody--> anyone see why the click event isnt firing for this https://gist.github.com/bb47b3668d2b243b73bf
[08:20:25] <jeffsmykil> is the opacity triggered by something?
[08:20:57] <jeffsmykil> SlexAxton: is batman a corgie?
[08:23:10] <BlaDe^> ajpiano: can I apply that to my problem?
[08:23:28] <ajpiano> ostensibly
[08:23:53] <BlaDe^> is that the same as "i don't know" ? ;)
[08:24:00] <ajpiano> nope, check out a dictionary
[08:24:26] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: var widths = $(".elems").map(function() { return $(this).width(); }), widest = Math.max.apply( Math, widths );
[08:24:31] <jeffsmykil> apparently or purportedly, but perhaps not actually : portrayed as a blue-collar type, ostensibly a carpenter.
[08:24:50] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  but I need the element in question not just the width
[08:25:01] <BlaDe^> i mean, i need left, and width and probably margin too to add them all up
[08:25:11] <BLeg> is anyone able to lend a hand with the filter function? I have a relaively complex problem
[08:26:11] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: var widestIndex = $.inArray( widest, widths ); $(".elems").eq( widestIndex );
[08:26:20] <danielbak> Hi, is anyone here who can help me with my twitter bootstrap carousel problem?
[08:26:22] <ajpiano> or something like that
[08:26:25] <danielbak> I'm using Rails
[08:27:02] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  nice.. could that break mid-resize?
[08:27:12] <ajpiano> donno
[08:27:13] <BlaDe^> i mean the order of the elements could change if masonry triggers
[08:27:25] <danielbak> ajpiano, could you help me?
[08:27:28] <ajpiano> nope
[08:27:33] <BlaDe^> i'll give it a go anyway, thanks a lot
[08:27:35] <BlaDe^> danielbak:  ask your question
[08:27:38] <ajpiano> i have to get off the computer and measure the dimensions of my furniture
[08:28:00] <danielbak> https://github.com/chefscott/dbak <--- in the about page I have a carousel using jquery but it doesn't work
[08:28:11] <jeffsmykil> i don't know if ajpiano is being sarcastic or serious
[08:28:18] <jeffsmykil> quite the connundrum
[08:28:39] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: dead serious
[08:28:41] <danielbak> I put a google hosted jquery link in the header and loaded the script in the body but it's not working
[08:29:05] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you should instead measure the amount of air they displace
[08:29:08] <jeffsmykil> be more accurate
[08:30:20] <danielbak> BlaDe^: any idea?
[08:31:49] <BLeg> i have a list of sibling divs (varying in number) coming from a drupal views output. I've styled the divs to be in rows of 3. I want to put a bottom border on each of the divs, but only if they're not in the last row, as this row can be a row of one or two instead of a full row of 3. Can this be done with jQuery?
[08:31:52] <BlaDe^> danielbak: you want us to lok through your entire repo?
[08:32:31] <danielbak> BlaDe^:  nooo, just app/views/home/about.html.erb
[08:32:57] <quicksilver> BLeg: Yes. Count the divs. Get remainder after dividing by 3. Select that all except those ones. Add border. Profit.
[08:33:42] <danielbak> BlaDe^: http://pastebin.com/Wn09gZrs
[08:34:59] <quicksilver> danielbak: "it's not working" really doesn't tell people very much.
[08:35:14] <quicksilver> i expect you either haven't loaded jquery or you haven't loaded carousel.
[08:35:26] <danielbak> quicksilver: it's supposed to slide through images but it's just dead, doesn't perform the function
[08:35:44] <danielbak> quicksilver: i have them both loaded in another file
[08:35:55] <quicksilver> I doubt it.
[08:36:00] <BLeg> quicksilver: I'd thought of that, and then for some reason couldn't think of how to implement it until after you said it
[08:36:04] <quicksilver> or at least, I doubt you have it working correctly.
[08:36:24] <quicksilver> which carousel are you using? how are you loading it?
[08:36:43] <danielbak> i have them in app/assets/ javascript folder
[08:37:02] <danielbak> the application.js loads them automatically and in the head of the main layout file I have it loading the google hosted jquery
[08:37:15] <quicksilver> we need to see the actual generated HTML
[08:37:30] <quicksilver> either by putting a version of your site online or at least pasting what it produces.
[08:37:48] <Carlitta87> just went into css group to ask a css question...no one knows....but anywho...does anyone know how i can create a custome like box with my own css?
[08:38:06] <Carlitta87> ive tried the tutorials online n they seem a bit old...
[08:38:10] <BLeg> what do you mean a custom like box
[08:38:48] <danielbak> quicksilver: http://danbak.herokuapp.com/about
[08:40:28] <SlexAxton> jeffsmykil: miniature schnauzer
[08:42:14] <quicksilver> danielbak: WFM.
[08:42:18] <quicksilver> danielbak: for some sense of "works"
[08:42:23] <quicksilver> danielbak: the image changes from time to time
[08:42:29] <danielbak> WFM?
[08:42:38] <quicksilver> works for me.
[08:42:45] <quicksilver> your carousel is apparently loading and doing something.
[08:42:52] <jillescode> hey guys, I have a div called x, within that div is an h1, and a p, now I want to hide the P when the H1 of DIV is clicked, how would I do this?
[08:43:01] <quicksilver> one of the things it displays is your script tag which is a bit odd
[08:43:06] <danielbak> so it's not having to do with improper loading of the jquery file or the carousel file?
[08:43:33] <jillescode> $('x h1').on('click', function(){ *show this.p* });
[08:43:35] <quicksilver> danielbak: move the script tag outside of the carousel div
[08:43:45] <quicksilver> danielbak: but in safari at least, that page seems to work ok
[08:45:06] <danielbak> what do you  mean move it out of the carousel div? it's not in any divs
[08:45:57] <quicksilver> danielbak: it is in the generated source in safari. Something is odd. Maybe there is a missing </div> tag somewhere
[08:46:27] <quicksilver> danielbak: yes, you have a typo, <div> shoulud be </div>
[08:46:36] <quicksilver> danielbak: after the "D2" image
[08:46:43] <quicksilver> danielbak: and that throws all the nesting off
[08:46:53] <danielbak> ohhh
[08:46:53] <danielbak> okay
[08:46:54] <quicksilver> which means the script is inside the carousel the way safari reads it.
[08:47:03] <quicksilver> and probably explains why other browsers do differ things
[08:49:41] <amaroks> Hello, Im getting a .datepicker is not a function but not sure whats causing the conflict her :( http://dev2.appraisalhost.com/ even though I used a jquery noconflict

[09:09:30] <_bart> Hey, I'm handling ajax requests but I noticed it's only 200ms 'waiting' and then 2 minutes 'receiving'. What is it doing in 'receiving' state?
[09:22:11] <BlaDe^> _bart:  it's sending
[09:25:42] <Tomashe> $('.V').show().delay(2000).hide(); < why this isnt working at all and no error
[09:25:45] <Tomashe> it just doesnt show
[09:27:08] <wolfehr> Tomashe, check that the element definitely has the class V
[09:27:16] <Tomashe> sure it has
[09:27:27] <wolfehr> Tomashe, jsfiddle the test case of code
[09:27:32] <Tomashe> when i remove the the delay and hide its working
[09:28:11] <wolfehr> what happens if you switch show/hide for fadeIn and fadeOut
[09:28:24] <quicksilver> show/hide without a numeric parameter aren't animations
[09:28:24] <jeffsmykil> mother fucker i just messed up version control
[09:28:28] <Tomashe> let me see
[09:28:30] <quicksilver> I don't think they get queued.
[09:29:26] <jnettik> so I have a superfish dropdown and in ie8 i need to use the -ms-filter hack. that breaks my dropdowns. anyone have an idea why?
[09:29:32] <Tomashe> when i change to fadeout at the end its working
[09:30:00] <quicksilver> $('.V).show(); setTimeout(function() { $('.V').hide() },2000);
[09:30:03] <quicksilver> Tomashe: ^^
[09:30:11] <wolfehr> fadeout has a default animation period I think, which explains it
[09:30:33] <wolfehr> http://api.jquery.com/show/ as quicksilver said, show() becomes an animation method when a duration is provided
[09:32:21] <jnettik> this is only a problem in ie8. ie7 works fine
[09:34:18] <Steisi_F> what's the problem?
[09:36:26] <jnettik> Steisi_F: was that at me?
[09:37:11] <Steisi_F> yes
[09:37:28] <jnettik> so I have a superfish dropdown and in ie8 i need to use the -ms-filter hack. that breaks my dropdowns. anyone have an idea why?
[09:37:49] <Steisi_F> yeah
[09:37:57] <Steisi_F> the idea is that your code is buggy
[09:38:02] <Steisi_F> we must examine it
[09:39:57] <jnettik> this is the css that breaks things. without this everything works
[09:39:58] <jnettik> http://chopapp.com/#7koc6pc9
[09:40:13] <binaryfus10nz> was goign to ask if its possible to fade gradient backgrounds CSS3 but found this: http://sapphion.com/2011/10/css3-gradient-transition-with-background-position/
[09:40:52] <binaryfus10nz> curious the best way to have an icon cololr fade/change.. normally I set one as the BG then fade another elemenet on top of it.. is it possible to fade out 1bg image and then fade in another... all on the same element css3 or need JS ?
[09:41:00] <Steisi_F> well
[09:41:09] <Steisi_F> I can't answer to all of you at the same time
[09:41:13] <Steisi_F> who is first?
[09:41:21] <jnettik> dibs
[09:42:42] <Steisi_F> dibs?
[09:44:32] <jnettik> nevermind haha
[09:44:52] <Steisi_F> that's not nice
[09:45:23] <jnettik> you asked who was first. i was calling dibs.
[09:45:41] <Steisi_F> okay you're first then
[09:45:42] <jnettik> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibs
[09:47:38] <jnettik> so is there a reason -ms-filter breaks superfish?
[09:48:06] <Steisi_F> actually -no
[09:48:26] <Steisi_F> you must make agile tests as soon as possible
[09:48:54] <picori> Where's the jquery ui channeL/
[09:48:58] <picori> Where's the jquery ui channel?
[09:49:15] <jnettik> agile tests?
[09:49:37] <Steisi_F> yes, that's right

[09:59:11] <bot-t> polishguy94, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:59:59] <polishguy94> http://jsfiddle.net/MPb5H/
[10:01:36] <Brodingo> polishguy94 just glancing i think event goes before selector
[10:03:43] <polishguy94> Should I put event as an argument of a function in first line?
[10:04:36] <Brodingo> ?on @ polishguy94
[10:04:36] <bot-t> polishguy94, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[10:20:50] <zelrik> hi
[10:20:51] <tehOPEologist> can i do something like ('#' + employee) or something?
[10:21:41] <tehOPEologist> trying to dynamically call a div, and employee is the name of the div, i just don't know how to add the hashtag before it so it becomes the object that i'm selecting..

[10:38:50] <flaggy> I'm playing with input text autocomplete UI, but I can't figure out how to highlight the matched letters. Isn't it possible?
[10:41:11] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here going to jquerysf? is it all training? what is the agenda/
[10:44:00] <picori> I need to report a bug with jquery ui
[10:46:00] <picori> Using the draggable method, whenever an element's origin (starting position) has changed position, the alignment with the element and cursor changes. This is because jQuery is using relative positioning, rather than absolute positioning.
[10:48:08] <gnarf> flaggy: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/master/autocomplete/jquery.ui.autocomplete.html.js - you can do a lot with autocomplete if you extend it
[10:52:07] <InphraRed> suppose I have in my CSS, "div:hover { background-color:blue; }"  if I change any style attribute via javascript, the CSS:hover/click whatever no longer works.  How do I change CSS styles with javascript without destroying the hover/click etc.?

[10:54:58] <LukeNukem> Hey
[10:55:12] <LukeNukem> anyone know any plugin with which i can fluidly keep on rotating images
[10:55:12] <LukeNukem> so that it looks like a wheel :P
[10:55:32] <blindMoe> roundabout might do it
[10:55:36] <polishguy94> Can anyone help me with broken jQuery? http://a-aliasy.rhcloud.com/ this is my site: submit a form with empty second field, then there will be a notification, there's an X for closing it. But it doesn't fade out, nor does the event.preventDefault work. Can anyone help me?
[10:55:45] <blindMoe> you want a 3 dimensional look or just 2d?
[10:55:58] <LukeNukem> 2D
[10:56:14] <LukeNukem> blindMoe, my client wants an image to rotate for a while and stop on the homepage
[10:56:28] <LukeNukem> so this can be done in flash but meh i cant bother to learn it now
[10:56:36] <shwaiil> A few moments ago, I left a question about how to do a horizontal scroll, for some nested elements on a container overflow hidden. I was working in the jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/QRq3y/29/   My question is, is this correct ? I notice that it's very stuck, is not smooth. Can someone give a tip about how to do this ? Thanks a lot for looking!
[10:56:36] <blindMoe> well that and flash sucks
[10:57:03] <LukeNukem> yes blindMoe
[10:59:18] <blindMoe> LukeNukem: can't think of one off the top of my head but I would imagine there are a ton out there
[11:00:54] <picori> How can I fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/PW63J/
[11:01:35] <gasull> Why (or why not) is it better to use onchange vs $('#something').change()?
[11:02:18] <ProLoser|Work> gasull: why are you using onchange?
[11:02:58] <LukeNukem> blindMoe, ok i figured it out :D now i just have to make it a bit more fluid :0
[11:03:20] <sunbeam> Which jq plugin can i best use if i have a header navigation, and when on clicking of any of the 4 links i would like to move to the belonging chapter. Eg. when i click <a class="work" href="#">Work</a> it should slide (all on the same page) to #chapter_work
[11:04:07] <LukeNukem> sunbeam, um code it youself, it shouldn't be that hard :)
[11:04:16] <gasull> ProLoser|Work: when an input field is changed I need to perform a validation using Ajax.
[11:04:44] <LukeNukem> gasull, use keyup or keydown
[11:04:50] <gasull> ProLoser|Work: My question is if as a matter of good practice or style is it better to use $().change or onchange.
[11:05:07] <ProLoser|Work> how would you use onchange?
[11:06:35] <gasull> ProLoser|Work: define my function, then onchange="myFunction();"
[11:06:53] <ProLoser|Work> when is that ever been the preferred approach?
[11:07:00] <gasull> LukeNukem: why keyup/keydown instead
[11:07:00] <ProLoser|Work> why not do onClick
[11:07:02] <gasull> ?
[11:07:03] <ProLoser|Work> or onMouseOver
[11:07:16] <LukeNukem> gasull, on change is just like when you erase the entire field
[11:07:23] <gasull> ProLoser|Work: it's a text input field
[11:07:26] <LukeNukem> keyup or keydown is on every keystroke
[11:07:34] <LukeNukem> gasull, use on click or focus
[11:07:39] <shoky> gasull: use .change() or .on('change'
[11:07:51] <ProLoser|Work> gasull: what does that matter?
[11:07:55] <LukeNukem> id say keyup or keydown is better
[11:08:04] <ProLoser|Work> i am just curious why you started to think you should use inline js
[11:08:06] <LukeNukem> gasull, heh il prepare a fiddle
[11:08:12] <ProLoser|Work> is there some blog post you read or something?
[11:08:24] <ProLoser|Work> LukeNukem: and what if i paste text into the input?
[11:08:53] <shoky> he just asked about .change() vs. onchange
[11:08:58] <shoky> what are you guys on about
[11:09:06] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure what LukeNukem is going on about
[11:09:15] <ProLoser|Work> i'm just curious why he's looking at inline js out of the blue
[11:09:20] <shoky> what inline js?
[11:09:25] <ProLoser|Work> it's like asking if you should use onclick vs .click()
[11:09:33] <ProLoser|Work> shoky: onchage
[11:09:41] <ProLoser|Work> <input onchange="someFn()"
[11:09:42] <polishguy94> How do I attach listeners to the handlers which showed up because of ajax get?
[11:09:44] <shoky> he didn't say he'd be doing it in his html
[11:09:48] <ProLoser|Work> yes he did
[11:09:51] <shoky> where
[11:09:54] <ProLoser|Work> how else do you do onchange?
[11:09:56] <winux> How would I check if a form is valid from within submitHandler (inside a validate call) ?
[11:09:59] <LukeNukem> ProLoser|Work, keyup works with copypaste too :|
[11:10:01] <shoky> element.onchange = function() {}
[11:10:08] <ProLoser|Work> shoky: gasull: ProLoser|Work: define my function, then onchange="myFunction();"
[11:10:14] <LukeNukem> gasull, http://jsfiddle.net/JLZHW/
[11:10:43] <shoky> oh well if he meant in the html then sure, don't do that
[11:10:49] <ProLoser|Work> LukeNukem: use the mouse, not the keyboard
[11:10:54] <ProLoser|Work> right-click & paste
[11:11:02] <LukeNukem> well
[11:11:06] <LukeNukem> ok im
[11:11:07] <LukeNukem> ...
[11:11:09] <LukeNukem> DAMN U
[11:11:17] <gasull> ProLoser|Work, LukeNukem: thank you guys.  I'll write all JS as external.
[11:11:38] <ProLoser|Work> shoky: i still don't know why you'd opt for element.onchange but i am just curious why someone who should know by now (since they use jq) that you don't do inline js, why he brought it up for 1 unusual situation
[11:11:52] <ProLoser|Work> i was wondering if he read some antipattern somewhere
[11:11:56] <ProLoser|Work> or some blog post
[11:12:02] <ProLoser|Work> LukeNukem: lol
[11:12:22] <Whirl3d> good afternoon all. does this seem valid:    return ($.when(contract));    where contract is an array of deferred objects?
[11:12:28] <ProLoser|Work> LukeNukem: made me chuckle
[11:12:29] <ProLoser|Work> anywho
[11:12:32] <ProLoser|Work> anyone going to the sf conf?
[11:12:38] <ProLoser|Work> i have a ticket but i don't know that i want it anymore
[11:12:46] <shoky> ProLoser|Work:  asking about element.onchange vs $(element).change()  is a valid question for a noob or just someone curious.  but yea as i said if he meant inline then its odd
[11:12:46] <Whirl3d> say wat?
[11:12:48] <ProLoser|Work> i only see a introductory tutorial agenda
[11:12:52] <LukeNukem> ProLoser|Work, now you have me looking how to bind two events to the same function
[11:13:17] <ProLoser|Work> shoky: i still don't know about element.onchange because you can't do multiple bindings that way
[11:13:26] <shoky> dont know what?
[11:13:29] <shoky> it's just a question
[11:13:39] <polishguy94> I desperately need your help!
[11:13:50] <polishguy94> why do you ignore me :(?
[11:14:05] <Whirl3d> ? ask @ polishguy94
[11:14:05] <bot-t> polishguy94, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:14:07] <ProLoser|Work> i figure if you knew about $().whatever() you would have long-since been past the point of using more basic approaches
[11:14:19] <ProLoser|Work> polishguy94: i don't like the polish
[11:14:28] <ProLoser|Work> LukeNukem: huh?
[11:14:35] <shoky> polishguy94  you either attach them after adding them to the DOM, or you use .on() with event delegation
[11:14:45] <ProLoser|Work> .on("keyup keydown", fn())
[11:14:47] <shoky> ?on @ polishguy94
[11:14:48] <bot-t> polishguy94, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:14:49] <ProLoser|Work> @ LukeNukem
[11:15:03] <polishguy94> I am using on(); and it doesn't work
[11:15:22] <ProLoser|Work> polishguy94: look at delegation and live binding
[11:15:29] <LukeNukem> ProLoser|Work, so
[11:15:30] <LukeNukem> with a space
[11:15:32] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[11:15:44] <ProLoser|Work> you can pass 1 callback or optionally one for each binding (i think)
[11:15:55] <ProLoser|Work> in respective order
[11:15:56] <polishguy94> http://pastebin.com/rD3wbYHX
[11:16:36] <LukeNukem> ProLoser|Work, tell me any two events i can test this with
[11:16:55] <ProLoser|Work> keydown and up doesn't work?
[11:16:59] <ProLoser|Work> or mouseover vs mouseout
[11:17:00] <shoky> Whirl3d: $.when doesn't accept an array of deferreds
[11:17:15] <LukeNukem> progrock, keydown and up is probably the same innit
[11:17:19] <LukeNukem> just
[11:17:21] <LukeNukem> kind of a diff
[11:17:39] <Whirl3d> In the case where multiple Deferred objects are passed to jQuery.when, t
[11:18:15] <Whirl3d> how else would I pass multiple Deferred objects to when. isn't that it's primary function
[11:19:07] <shoky> multiple deferreds as seperate arguments
[11:19:36] <ProLoser|Work> anyone going to the conference?
[11:19:51] <Whirl3d> You are kidding me, right? Wow. So I need to monkey patch .when to understand that if passed an array, treat it as separate objects?
[11:19:58] <Whirl3d> Seems weird
[11:20:07] <polishguy94> the funny thing is that after I make ajax request and  in browser's js console insert my on() function one more time , event works perfectly
[11:20:08] <LukeNukem> ProLoser|Work, http://jsfiddle.net/JLZHW/7/
[11:20:15] <LukeNukem> help me out to test multiple events please
[11:20:18] <shoky> Whirl3d: $.when.apply(this, arrayOfDeferreds)
[11:20:52] <Whirl3d> shoky, you amaze me. I would have never thought of that. Thanks again for your sage advice.
[11:21:03] <shoky> np
[11:21:36] <ProLoser|Work> looks fine to me LukeNukem
[11:22:39] <LukeNukem> ProLoser|Work, thanks a lot man, you just saved a tiny project of mine :D
[11:24:01] <polishguy94> I've been reading documentation of jQuery and I still cannot spot my mistake in code.
[11:24:09] <LessSeen> polishguy94, wth @ the console.log on line 4
[11:24:52] <shoky> more wth comments such as:  // self-explanatory
[11:24:52] <LessSeen> ? .live @ polishguy94
[11:24:53] <bot-t> polishguy94, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:24:59] <shoky> no don't use .live
[11:25:03] <shoky> he's already using the preferred .on
[11:25:14] <LessSeen> kk
[11:25:19] <LessSeen> <ignore me>
[11:25:33] <shoky> polishguy94: is .alert-box  in the DOM when page is loaded?
[11:26:09] <shoky> if so then see ?demo
[11:26:09] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:26:29] <polishguy94> shoky: no it isn't
[11:26:35] <shoky> there's your problem then
[11:26:52] <shoky> that .on() does nothing
[11:27:04] <polishguy94> so what should I do?
[11:27:13] <ProLoser|Work> LukeNukem: how so?
[11:27:35] <shoky> polishguy94: you need to delegate the event handling to a container element that's already in the dom when you call .on()
[11:27:58] <shoky> polishguy94: either some container div , or 'body' or document.  (preferably some container)
[11:28:34] <shoky> e.g.:  $(document).on('click', 'a.close', ....)
[11:28:59] <polishguy94> thank you, shoky
[11:29:09] <shoky> np
[11:30:45] <LukeNukem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urxladmqaKs
[11:30:50] <LukeNukem> such a classic
[11:32:12] <hacks> How can fix this behavior? http://jsfiddle.net/PW63J/
[11:32:48] <polishguy94> shoky: works like a charm <3
[11:32:56] <shoky> ;]
[11:33:52] <vacho> $("#dialog-form").load('dialog.ajax.php').dialog("open");
[11:34:01] <vacho> that works fine, but how do I pass get parameters to my URL?
[11:34:24] <shoky> hacks: i dont really see that as bad behavior..
[11:34:38] <shoky> you want your cursor to jump??
[11:34:54] <melvinram> I'm trying to set the css width to 100% on browser resize using this code http://www.stratocommunications.com.php53-3.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/themes/thesis_184/custom/javascript/custom.js?ver=3.3.2 Anyone see why isn't work?
[11:35:05] <hacks> shoky: I want the dragged element to remain under the cursor, obviously.
[11:35:26] <hacks> Why would I want the element to jump like that, it doesn't make sense.
[11:36:42] <melvinram> nvm
[11:36:47] <melvinram> wrong targeting
[11:36:59] <ghing> I have an iframe ('#parent-iframe') that contains a tinymce-enabled textarea (so TinyMCE replaces the textarea with an iframe.  In Chrome (but not Firefox), I get a cross-domain error when  calling $('#parent-iframe').contents() is there any way to work around this?
[11:38:00] <InphraRed> how do I test for a class?  if($("#" + classname)) { $("#" + classname).show("slow") }
[11:38:10] <gho5t> .hasClass
[11:38:25] <ghing> I don't need to access the TinyMCE iframe, just the parent iframe (which is served from the same domain, so its okay)
[11:38:27] <InphraRed> $("#test").hasClass?  it's a boolean?
[11:38:39] <gho5t> word
[11:38:42] <NoiseEee> InphraRed: if only there were some kind of documentation somewhere
[11:38:54] <InphraRed> NoiseEee I know!
[11:38:56] <gho5t> yeah unfortunately they stored everything in my head
[11:42:25] <k1ng> what is better than jeditable?
[11:43:04] <gho5t> jeditable + 1
[11:43:32] <k1ng> ?
[11:45:17] <binaryfus10nz> is there a way to call a .hover like .click..... for example....   $('.foo').click(function() {  $('.bar').click();   });         how can I imitate for a hover to be called to .bar without it being hovered?
[11:46:03] <binaryfus10nz> can you do a fake mouseenter ?
[11:46:11] <gho5t> binaryfus10nz: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:46:28] <ProLoser|Work> k1ng: one sec
[11:46:31] <ProLoser|Work> i have something better
[11:46:38] <binaryfus10nz> gho5t, so trigger supports hover
[11:46:57] <ProLoser|Work> http://aloha-editor.org/
[11:47:05] <binaryfus10nz> only shows bind and click still hmm ?
[11:47:11] <ProLoser|Work> @ gho5t & k1ng
[11:47:51] <gho5t> binaryfus10nz: I don't think they're going to show every event type in their examples
[11:48:03] <binaryfus10nz> ok well I will mess with this and see how it goes thx sir
[11:48:46] <k1ng> um ProLoser|Work, its a WYSIWYG Editor
[11:48:54] <k1ng> jeditable is not a WYSIWYG Editor
[11:50:38] <Whirl3d> apply changes the context of the function you are calling, right? whereas call allows you call a function with a paramter...var x=function (el) {console.log(el);}   x.call(someDiv)   would work, but x.apply(someDiv) would not...is this correct?
[11:50:52] <binaryfus10nz> anyone recommend any good full page preloaders ? good/bad practice?
[11:50:58] <ProLoser|Work> you could try the editable property
[11:51:18] <shoky> Whirl3d: call and apply are exactly the same, except call receives seperate arguments, and apply receives an array of arguments
[11:52:08] <shoky> Whirl3d: in your examples you're not referncing the context at all so they would both 'work'
[11:52:54] <shoky> both of them set the context to the first argument
[11:53:24] <binaryfus10nz> does it make any difference leaving a blank callback placeholder? 	jQuery('#home-text h2').animate({'bottom' : '0px'}, {duration: 1200, easing: 'easeInOutExpo', complete: function(){}});		
[11:53:30] <Whirl3d> If you got a second, I am dangerously close the first pre-alpha of my concept. It is commented and designed for two specific use cases, but the idea is the same, I just need to refine and abstract it a little. Just having a scope issue at the moment...
[11:53:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/N7tzP/5/
[11:53:40] <binaryfus10nz> should I remove it if not used, or totally ok to leave it if I want to
[11:54:07] <shoky> hm can you point me to the issue?
[11:54:46] <InphraRed> ok hasclass isn't working, how do I test if the document has a tag of a certian /id/class.
[11:55:39] <Whirl3d> sure. wherever it says function (el) { .... I think I need to change that to function ()  and use $(this) inside of it.
[11:55:39] <vacho> ajpiano: sir :)
[11:55:56] <shoky> Whirl3d:   first of all - return ($.when.apply(someContext, contract))
[11:55:59] <binaryfus10nz> ajpiano, how are you sir
[11:56:04] <vacho> $("#dialog-form").load('dialog.ajax.php').dialog("open"); ... that works fine, but how would I go about adding GET parameters to my URL request?
[11:56:04] <ajpiano> InphraRed: $("#foo").length
[11:56:07] <shoky> someContext can be 'this' or 'null' or anything
[11:56:14] <ajpiano> why is every body pinging me
[11:56:19] <binaryfus10nz> anyone use any shorthand code minifiers? like minimal syntax kinda thing?
[11:56:24] <vacho> ajpiano: because you are a genius :)
[11:56:26] <ajpiano> hi vacho and binaryfus10nz :p
[11:56:41] <shoky> hi aj !!!
[11:56:45] <ajpiano> hi shoky
[11:56:56] <ajpiano> shoky: you have really upped your game lately, thanks for helping out so much :)
[11:56:58] <InphraRed> ajpiano thanks
[11:57:30] <shoky> ajpiano: wow thanks for saying this :))
[11:57:47] <ajpiano> :)
[11:57:58] <ajpiano> best way to learn is to solve other people's problems so you don't have to solve them when they become your problems :)
[11:57:58] <vacho> how lovely...
[11:58:01] <binaryfus10nz> anyone use any method to write other than raw jQuery ?
[11:58:05] <vacho> ajpiano: can you take a look at my question?
[11:58:23] <shoky> so true, aj :)
[11:59:07] <bung> I've got a ajax call set to synchonous (sjax?) that's inside a document.ready, however the browser wont render the page until the call completes. I thought document.ready fires after rendering? or is it only after the dom is loaded?
[11:59:19] <dabear_> binaryfus10nz: is there an unraw version of jquery?
[12:00:06] <dabear_> bung: use async..
[12:00:28] <bung> dabear_: yea that's what were going to do, but i was more curious about why
[12:00:39] <bung> about why the original issue that is
[12:01:03] <dabear_> the original issue is that your code should be async
[12:01:10] <dabear_> not ever should it be sync
[12:01:30] <bung> fair enough, do you know what i should google to understand why
[12:01:41] <binaryfus10nz> dabear_, same way they have this for CSS I believe they have for JS http://sass-lang.com/
[12:02:19] <binaryfus10nz> actually dabear_ this is a better example http://intridea.com/posts/sass-the-better-more-powerful-css
[12:02:29] <dabear_> binaryfus10nz: there are many other langauges that compile to js
[12:02:38] <dabear_> you can even compile c++ code down to js
[12:02:44] <binaryfus10nz> I was looking for recommendation if someone uses any
[12:02:53] <dabear_> coffeescript is one
[12:03:17] <dabear_> but you wanted to "not write raw jquery"
[12:03:23] <binaryfus10nz> yea thats what I was thinking of, but is there one for jquery or that is it
[12:03:33] <dabear_> that is something completely different from "not write raw javascript code"
[12:03:48] <binaryfus10nz> well now that you better understand... is there anything
[12:04:05] <dabear_> binaryfus10nz: jquery is an API
[12:04:08] <dabear_> not a language
[12:04:16] <binaryfus10nz> ok
[12:04:29] <binaryfus10nz> but same question/theory still applies
[12:04:53] <dabear_> so you want a dummed down version of jquery?
[12:04:56] <binaryfus10nz> anything for better shorthand or no
[12:05:09] <gho5t> dude
[12:06:38] <bung> binaryfus10nz: coffeescript?
[12:06:59] <binaryfus10nz> wow this looks fun: http://lesscss.org/
[12:07:20] <gho5t> yeah it's pretty good at generating jquery
[12:07:36] <bung> heh
[12:09:34] <jcp_> Why doesn't this loop? http://jsfiddle.net/hZ7QP/
[12:10:29] <dabear_> jcp_: doing foo() calls the function foo immediately
[12:10:38] <dabear_> remove the parens
[12:10:49] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N7tzP/8/
[12:11:11] <dabear_> jcp_: next time, go to ##javascript for general js questions
[12:11:40] <shoky> Whirl3d: i removed all the .apply() and .call() except for the two $.when.apply()  <- to which i added 'null' as first argument (they dont need any context)
[12:11:53] <shoky> i mean, $.when doesn't need any context
[12:12:57] <shoky> Whirl3d: nothing wrong with having function(el) {..}   and then passing the element to it.  using .apply() and setting the context to 'el' instead is much messier and has no benefit in this case
[12:13:20] <johnkpaul> sphinxxx: good idea with gzipwtf yesterday, I don't quite know how to add the bot though
[12:13:35] * shoky sits on jkp
[12:13:49] <gho5t> dabear_: actually he needs to use setInterval to have it repeat
[12:13:49] <johnkpaul> ouch
[12:13:53] <sekretskwerl> hey guys, is it possible to delay an ajax call 300ms or so, for a key press function, for example, and if another key is pressed in that 300ms it doesn't do the first call, but then waits another 300ms on the second key press to fire the ajax?
[12:13:58] <shoky> i'm not that heavy
[12:14:00] <shoky> or pointy
[12:14:12] <johnkpaul> sekretskwerl: look into the jquery debounce plugin
[12:14:15] <johnkpaul> ?debounce
[12:14:20] <gho5t> jcp_: use setInterval
[12:14:32] <johnkpaul> aw, no bot
[12:15:48] <Whirl3d> shoky, when I run it now, however, there is nothing defined for el
[12:16:08] <shoky> hmm where
[12:16:26] <blindMoe> anyone played around with jQuery masonry?
[12:16:38] <jcp_> gho5t: thanks , got it working http://jsfiddle.net/hZ7QP/1/ -- added back the jquery to avoid complains :P
[12:17:29] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: that is exactly what I need and was about to write from scratch. thanks.
[12:17:41] <johnkpaul> no problem, sekretskwerl, have fun
[12:17:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/N7tzP/10/
[12:18:20] <Whirl3d> in the actionFunc definition, I added the line console.log("some actionalll on ",el)
[12:18:22] <InphraRed> ajpiano that works like a charm
[12:18:25] <Whirl3d> and el= []
[12:18:27] <shoky> i don't see any console output
[12:18:34] <InphraRed> the $("#cname").length > 0
[12:18:35] <shoky> ohh
[12:19:13] <Whirl3d> the good news is that the function is being called, just not applied to the right context, it appears
[12:19:26] <Edulix> hi people
[12:20:09] <Edulix> how can I achieve both a fadein and a slideDown at the same time for an item I'm prepending to a div?
[12:24:22] <johnkpaul> Edulix: have you tried just calling both .fadeIn() and .slideDown() chained together?
[12:25:05] <Edulix> johnkpaul: yes
[12:26:47] <freeed> Edulix, $(html).hide().prependTo('.parent-div').animate({opacity: 1.0, height: '500px'}, 500, function(){ /*complete*/ })
[12:28:35] <freeed> Hey allâ€¦ I'm loading some images into a div with .load(), however, the images take a few seconds to download - so I'm unable to use .height() or similar. Is there a way I can use .ready() to check that all the new content has loaded? Only thing I could think of was creating a preloader to check that way..
[12:30:36] <johnkpaul> freeed: you can use the Image() constructor to preload an image
[12:30:40] <johnkpaul> and then check the width and height of that
[12:31:12] <freeed> @johnkpaul, yea thought soâ€¦ bummer. Ok, thanks!
[12:31:31] <johnkpaul> np, ther emight be another way, but I don't know of it
[12:32:17] <freeed> johnkpaul, do you know if it's possible to using .ready() when adding any new content to the DOM via ajax? Or can .ready() only be used on the initial page load?
[12:32:35] <shoky> Whirl3d:   wrong order of arguments to .map()  :)
[12:32:36] <johnkpaul> .ready will fire immediately if the dom is already loaded
[12:32:55] <Whirl3d> doh! I always do that
[12:32:57] <johnkpaul> it is intended to be used when the intiail page has loaded
[12:32:58] <shoky> ;D
[12:33:02] <freeed> johnkpaul, ahhh yea that makes sense. Ok - thanks.
[12:33:47] <B_> I'm using a lightbox plugin, which uses $(selector).lightBox() as its initializer. The function is defined as $.fn.lightBox = function(settings) {.......}. Is it possible to add an argument to the function? I'm not passing 'settings' when using the plugin.
[12:34:43] <Whirl3d> shoky it works! You genius. Thanks so much. it is the first step on what will be a really cool animation engine i hope.
[12:34:50] <johnkpaul> B_: are you sure that the settings are required?
[12:35:14] <B_> It's part of the implementation of the plugin... I just opened his .js file and that's what I was looking at
[12:35:35] <B_> the first line of the function is settings = jQuery.extend({ 			// Configuration related to overlay 			overlayBgColor: 		'#000',		// (string) Background color to overlay; inform a hexadecimal value like: #RRGGBB. Where RR, GG, and BB are the hexadecimal values for the red, green, and blue values of the color. 			overlayOpacity:			0.8,		// (integer) Opacity value to overlay; inform: 0.X. Where X are number from 0 to 9 			// Configuration rel
[12:35:50] <B_> oops, copied too much, my bad
[12:37:20] <johnkpaul> B_: have you tried without passing in the settings parameter?
[12:37:47] <shoky> Whirl3d: i'
[12:37:52] <shoky> Whirl3d: i'll be sure to try it out :)
[12:38:51] <B_> im not passing it
[12:39:04] <johnkpaul> B_: and is it not working as you're expecting?
[12:39:20] <B_> no, it is... I need to add something to it that didn't come out of the box
[12:40:19] <B_> the plugin works properly: it displays my lightbox with my image... all I want to do is add the caption associated to the image (it's actually a title coming from drupal) when the plugin is called
[12:40:49] <johnkpaul> oh, so you want to customize the plugin
[12:40:54] <B_> yes
[12:41:03] <johnkpaul> have you tried reading through the code? is there somewhere where you can add what you need to?
[12:41:11] <B_> i just want to know how to add a parameter to that function declaration
[12:41:34] <B_> yes, I've found where to display my text
[12:41:39] <B_> it's just getting it into the plug
[12:43:04] <NoiseEee> twss
[12:43:12] <johnkpaul> B_: you can just add it after settings
[12:43:19] <johnkpaul> change function(settings) to function(settings,title)
[12:44:40] <B_> i did that
[12:44:44] <B_> nothing happens
[12:45:34] <johnkpaul> what do you mean when you say "nothing happens"?
[12:45:37] <johnkpaul> ?demo @B_
[12:45:37] <bot-t> B_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:47:00] <B_> k i can't really provide a demo....
[12:47:04] <B_> nothing is boken
[12:52:33] <mordof> how would i get the value of a selected radio set?
[12:53:10] <mordof> (as in form elements)
[12:53:29] <freeed> mordof, $('input:radio').val()
[12:53:56] <mordof> freeed: all that's returning is "on"
[12:54:11] <hacks> Still haven't figured out how fix this http://jsfiddle.net/PW63J/
[12:54:56] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know of an ajax plugin that well verbose the ajax process?
[12:55:06] <freeed> mordof, radio values are only 'on' and 'off', maybe you're looking for the name? $('input[name="somename"]')
[12:55:29] <freeed> mordof, oops, $('input:radio').attr('name')
[12:56:17] <mordof> freeed: yes, but radios have an associated value with each individual one in a set. the problem wasn't my jquery - just realized i put val="" in the HTML instead of value="" ... jquery is ruining me -.-;
[12:56:29] <hacks> Shouldn't the left and top positions of a draggable element be calculated based off the cursor position and the offset left and top from the element's original position?
[12:56:53] <mordof> freeed: also, all radios have the same name. so that selector is pointless
[12:57:06] <jeffsmykil> anyone usingthe twitter bootstrap popovers with a site with a fixed layout with gutters?
[12:57:09] <mordof> that attribute anyway
[12:57:34] <jrockjiggz> $('input:radio').is(':checked').val()
[12:57:42] <hacks> Minus the to distence from the top and left edge of the cursor from the element when first clicked.
[12:57:57] <mordof> jrockjiggz: not necessary, but thanks. it was a problem with my HTML and not having typed the attribute properly
[12:58:06] <Validatorian> I'm trying to use a delegated .on with a bit of processing, but it's not working... $('#content').on('mousedown', '[data-tooltip="Share this post"]' works, but $('#content').on('mousedown', $('[data-tooltip="Share this post"]') does not (I need to use .add() for the delegated elements) - any ideas?
[12:58:08] <mordof> $('input:radio').val() does work with the HTML is proper, lol
[12:58:12] <mordof> when*
[12:58:24] <mordof> freeed: ty for the help :)
[13:04:23] <hacks> Example algorithm:: drag init: store click.x and click.y; store the element.left and element.top; store cursor distance from top and left edge of element (x and y minus the offsets of the element), distance.x and distance.y. drag movement: element's left and top is the relative distance from the element.lleft and element.top from the click.x and click.y, substracting the distance.x and distance.y. The algorithm should also take i
[13:04:23] <hacks> nto account any possible change that the element's origin (element.top/left) might undergo.
[13:04:36] <pflock> how do I change more than one css-property? I only know .css() and that only works for one property?
[13:04:58] <xec> pflock: you can give .css() an object literal with multiple properties
[13:05:43] <xec> pflock: .css({marginLeft: 200, color: "red"})
[13:07:21] <pflock> xec: thanks
[13:09:20] <Validatorian> anyone know how I can get this to work? This is a very simplified example, the .add is required: http://jsfiddle.net/MWLtL/1/
[13:12:35] <johnkpaul> what are you trying to do with that second parameter of on, Validatorian?
[13:12:42] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: http://jsfiddle.net/MWLtL/3/
[13:14:03] <Validatorian> johnkpaul: Those are the delegated elements that should allow the event to trigger
[13:14:32] <shoky> hacks: i think that would only be possible if .draggable() changed the element's position to absolute (or fixed..) , but this would have nasty side-effects
[13:14:33] <Validatorian> NoiseEee: That just spits out 'Foo' when I hover over anything -- I need it to spit out "Foo" when hovering over that, and "Bar" when hovering over that
[13:15:03] <shoky> hacks: nasty side-effects when something is dependant on that element's position being 'relative' . such as div floating to the left, as in your example
[13:15:12] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: take a look at what i've given you, which should illustrate how to use .on... come back with an attempt at what you want to do.
[13:15:31] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: and no, it only 'spits it out' when your hover matches the selector.
[13:15:51] <hacks> shoky: It's not "only" possible.
[13:16:00] <hacks> ..if absolute positioning is used.
[13:16:09] <shoky> hacks: actually i guess it could keep it 'relative' and make the necessary calculations.. but then it's not as simple as you suggested
[13:16:18] <hacks> I think it's perfectly plausible to use relative positioning and have it all work.
[13:16:38] <Validatorian> NoiseEee: I think you might not understand what .add is for -- it adds another selector to the current jQuery object, so $('.foo').add('.bar') is the same as $('.foo, .bar')
[13:16:51] <Validatorian> I don't want to add classes to the elements
[13:16:51] <shoky> hacks: build a prototype and let's see :)
[13:16:53] <hacks> shoky: Sure it's not simple, but it needs to be done. jquery needs to be awesome, not half-assed.
[13:16:55] <Validatorian> I want the elements in the selector
[13:16:56] <shoky> ^^
[13:17:17] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: it appears i did not understand what you were trying to do at all, and you don't understand how to use .on  ;)
[13:18:05] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: why are you intersted in pursuing the 'one that doesnt work' ?
[13:18:57] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: http://jsfiddle.net/MWLtL/4/
[13:19:31] <hacks> shoky: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8286
[13:19:35] <Validatorian> seriously, NoiseEee? You just uncommented what I had? As I said, .add is required.
[13:20:10] <Validatorian> yes, that works for this very simple example, but I need it to work using an appended jQuery object of other elements
[13:20:45] <gho5t> you suck
[13:20:59] <gho5t> wrong chan
[13:21:09] <Validatorian> I suppose I'm limited to only using a string there, and am unable to use a jquery object
[13:21:28] <Validatorian> guess I'll just duplicate the .on for each of my required elements
[13:22:10] <shoky> hacks: bad title, don't take your agressions out on people reading the bug tickets..
[13:22:39] <hacks> shoky: meh. XD
[13:22:42] <hacks> shoky: what should it say?
[13:24:08] <shoky> i donno man
[13:25:47] <infid_> if i use a cdn to load jquery, so that if the user has it cached they'll use that one, does that care about versions of jquery?
[13:26:24] <infid_> it's only going to work if they user happens to have cached the exact version of jquery that i'm telling it to use right, and does the file name have to be exactly the same?
[13:27:01] <gho5t> it will be cached if the user hit that exact url
[13:27:05] <gho5t> for jquery
[13:27:39] <hacks> shoky: lol
[13:28:26] <hacks> shoky: I wasn't really aggressive, I just used the word I thought best described the sitch. XD
[13:28:50] <shoky> kay. all i know is that when reading it, it immediately made me frown
[13:28:55] <ajpiano> hacks: "odd behavior" typically works better than "acts fucked up" in a public bug tracker
[13:29:08] <ajpiano> i realise you werne't be aggressive but it just comes off pretty rude
[13:30:23] <k1ng> any idea why i am getting random "has no method 'styleSwitcher'" on $(function() { });
[13:30:39] <k1ng> some time its fine some time its giving error
[13:34:46] <shoky> ?demo @ k1ng
[13:34:47] <bot-t> k1ng, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:35:26] <k1ng> shoky, its happens randomly. sometime its fine, sometime its broke
[13:35:53] <pflock> why doesnt $().css() work together with the css-transition value?
[13:36:15] <shoky> k1ng, the quality of help you get depends on the quality of your problem description
[13:36:36] <shoky> so far you're not getting any help
[13:36:53] <shoky> same goes for quantity i suppose
[13:37:44] <k1ng> its a problem to give access to site, its contain a lot of secrect information.
[13:38:42] <shoky> k1ng: when you randomly get that error, it means you randomly referenced a function 'styleSwitcher' on .. something
[13:39:00] <shoky> that has no styleSwitcher function
[13:39:15] <k1ng> its was dialog before
[13:39:51] <shoky> derpy derp derpy derp
[13:39:59] <k1ng> lol
[13:40:09] <shoky> ;>
[13:40:14] <k1ng> i had .dialog on $(function() { });
[13:40:31] <shoky> no idea, sorry
[13:40:35] <k1ng> i was getting error, i removed it and now its 'styleSwitcher'
[13:47:05] <pflock> I have a transition over 2 secs but when I use jQuery .css() the changes happen immeadeatly. Someone knows why?
[13:47:53] <Validatorian> does jQuery provide a method of converting html to text with formatting? e.g. <br(( ) /)> becomes \n and "&nbsp;" becomes " " and so on? .text() strips out <br> and such -- I can create a .replace, but I'd like to avoid it if there's already a method for that
[13:54:11] <shoky> pflock i donno much bout transitions bit if you jsfiddle your problem you'll prolly get some help
[13:54:57] <freeed> pflock, you probably need to use .animate() instead of .css() because .css() does not queue as an animation
[13:55:12] <shoky> he's talking about css transitions though
[13:56:17] <freeed> Ohh, my bad.
[13:56:30] <barh> Hello
[13:56:41] <barh> I need help with "toggle()"
[13:56:45] <barh> anyone here?
[13:56:48] <shoky> ?ask
[13:56:49] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:56:56] <barh> fine
[13:57:54] <barh> this is my website http://hd.barcoms.co.il/ and when i click on the button on the top right it suppose to toggle on or off
[13:58:06] <barh> but instead, it's toggle on and off
[13:58:14] <barh> not stopping after on
[13:58:16] <barh> or off
[13:58:33] <shoky> :)
[13:58:50] <barh> does anyone know what should i do?
[13:58:57] <shoky> shnia
[14:00:58] <shoky> you're hiding it and THEN toggling ?
[14:01:03] <barh> shoky - did you understand my problem?
[14:01:08] <shoky> yes
[14:01:17] <barh> shoky - yes
[14:01:44] <shoky> i think you want .slideDown instead of slideToggle
[14:02:01] <shoky> or just slideToggle, without hiding it first
[14:02:15] <sultan_> barh OR change your function to: http://pastebin.com/0D8JS3E7
[14:02:30] <barh> ok i'll check it
[14:02:36] <shoky> yes that's what i said
[14:03:04] <pflock> Can you only set one transition? I noticed it stops working when I have more than one css-property with a transition that I change?
[14:03:30] <barh> shoky - it doesn't work
[14:04:20] <barh> should i take off the "hide()" too?
[14:04:33] <barh> but i want to hide it at first
[14:04:50] <Giddeon> what's the best way to convert a full date and time string to a date object?
[14:05:04] <sultan_> barh no but you could do that with css
[14:05:22] <barh> display none?
[14:05:42] <shoky> ahhh
[14:05:59] <shoky> oops.
[14:06:10] <shoky> yeah display none
[14:06:14] <barh> with display none it still on and off
[14:06:20] <shoky> yea thats not the fix
[14:06:22] <barh> not on / off
[14:08:04] <barh> sultan- i tried hide with css but the animation still not working properly
[14:08:45] <shoky> muzar
[14:09:06] <sultan_> barh see not same element but general concept: http://jsbin.com/oquhuk
[14:09:17] <barh> ok
[14:09:42] <sultan_> gtg
[14:10:09] <scandana> hello. i've made the switch to using the jquery widget factory for plugin development. one thing i can't figure out, given that the widget factory architecture calls my plugin once for each element instead of all at once, is how to operate on a jquery object instead
[14:10:22] <barh> shoky - look it's the same but this one working
[14:11:16] <shoky> barh: maybe try putting the <script>  tag  inside the <head>
[14:11:17] <scandana> $( ".some_divs" ).myPlugin( "foo" ) so that i have access to jquery object containing the divs. any ideas?
[14:11:30] <shoky> barh: i think for some reason the .click event handler is running twice
[14:11:36] <shoky> so .slideToggle is getting called twice
[14:12:13] <barh> shoky - how it running twice?
[14:12:20] <shoky> barh: im not sure
[14:12:29] <shoky> barh: but why not put it in the <head> , that's its proper place
[14:12:38] <shoky> tasim , nu
[14:12:39] <barh> ok
[14:12:42] <shoky> ;p
[14:12:43] <pflock> Why do I still see the content of a div when I just changed display to 'none' via jquery.animate?
[14:12:55] <kollapse> ajpiano: Ping.
[14:12:56] <barh> shoky - works like a charm
[14:12:59] <barh> :)
[14:13:04] <shoky> :)
[14:13:23] <barh> but i did not understand what was the problem
[14:13:46] <shoky> me neither
[14:13:58] <shoky> that script was running twice somehow
[14:17:53] <Jon47> pflock it's weird to animate a non-numeric style property like "display"â€¦
[14:19:06] <pflock> Jon47: I want the divs to ease-out and ease-in... At the moment I am using .animate together with .show and .hide but it all doesn't look very nice and you can see how the animations are done one after another and not all at once
[14:19:57] <Jon47> got an example?
[14:20:38] <someprimetime> you can use opacity
[14:20:43] <pflock> Jon47: What do you mean by that? I have to div's. One shall get smaller and fade out while doing that, the other one gets bigger at the same time and a textarea appears
[14:21:00] <Jon47> ?demo pflock
[14:21:02] <bot-t> Jon47, Couldn't find "demo pflock" in jQuery Docs.
[14:21:11] <Jon47> how do you do that
[14:21:24] <Jon47> pflock: i'm just sayin, do you ahve a fiddle or something that shows your problem that we can tweak?
[14:21:32] <pflock> Jon47: Using .animate() for width and .show() and .hide() to change display
[14:21:34] <someprimetime> .animate({opacity: 0}, 0) .animate({opacity: 1}, 'slow')
[14:21:36] <someprimetime> something like that
[14:21:49] <ColloquyBenutzer> Jep
[14:22:29] <alexr2> is there any way for jquery to parse a json string when the parameters are single quoted? (ie: "{'param1':'val1'}"
[14:22:55] <pflock> someprimetime: but that won't solve the problem that the animations don't happen at the same time, will it? and why do I need opacity:0 first?
[14:23:11] <someprimetime> you want it to animate and fadeIn
[14:23:13] <someprimetime> ?
[14:23:37] <someprimetime> post a fiddle
[14:23:42] <pflock> someprimetime: Yes, animate 2 divs and fadeOut one div and fadeIn another textarea at the same time
[14:29:59] <alexr2> anyone?
[14:30:02] <krazyj> hey allâ€¦ i have this HTML/CSS setup: https://gist.github.com/a6ea805ddfddc72147b4 / and #customized-menu is droppableâ€¦. in the `drop` function, i want to remove .bottom-item and replace it with .middle-item. however, in `drop`, when i call $(this).children.('.bottom-item')â€¦ i get 'unexpected token ('â€¦. any thoughts?
[14:30:23] <alexr2> l $(this).children.('
[14:30:27] <alexr2> shouldn't be .('
[14:30:32] <alexr2> at the end of children
[14:30:43] <alexr2> should just be children(
[14:30:47] <krazyj> ah
[14:30:50] <krazyj> it's not chained?
[14:30:50] <krazyj> ok
[14:30:55] <alexr2> children is a function
[14:31:15] <alexr2> ie: $(this).children('.bottom-item')
[14:31:20] <alexr2> you had an extra . in there
[14:31:23] <krazyj> ah ok
[14:31:28] <krazyj> and '.bottom-item' is an argumentâ€¦ gotcha.
[14:31:31] <shoky> alexr2: single quotes are not valid JSON
[14:31:47] <alexr2> i know shoky, i'm storing the string in a data attribute
[14:31:52] <krazyj> shoky: if i'm Doing It Right, should i be using double quotes throughout my JS code?
[14:32:06] <alexr2> but you can't store double quoted things in attributes
[14:32:16] <alexr2> krazyj, it doesn't matter, just keep consistent
[14:32:16] <vacho> $("#dialog-form").load('dialog.ajax.php').dialog("open"); ... that works fine, but how would I go about adding GET parameters to my URL request?
[14:32:17] <shoky> krazyj: single or double or both, JS doesn't care
[14:33:29] <shoky> alexr2: sure you can
[14:33:37] <alexr2> how?
[14:34:02] <alexr2> as in ... <span data-id="abc"></span>
[14:35:41] <krazyj> if i want to add a div with a certain class, how can i access it again, later in my code?
[14:35:59] <krazyj> it doesn't look like .addClass returns a reference to that object
[14:36:33] <alexr2> you have to make a selector for that div if you want to access it again
[14:37:01] <krazyj> so add it, look it up, then save the reference?
[14:37:20] <alexr2> not sure you can actually have a reference of it
[14:37:27] <alexr2> what do you need the reference for?
[14:37:39] <krazyj> er, just an object referring to it so i can, say, add content to it
[14:37:49] <krazyj> without looking it up each time i want to add content
[14:38:12] <alexr2> doesn't work that way... if you want to do it that way, you can look into using a javascript library like ember.js
[14:38:22] <alexr2> but that's pretty heavy
[14:38:34] <krazyj> ah k
[14:38:36] <alexr2> and it gets complicated pretty quickly
[14:38:37] <shoky> alexr2:  <span data-id='"bla"'>  or  <span data-id="&quot;bla&quot;">
[14:39:06] <krazyj> alexr2: so the general strategy, in jquery, is to select something and do something with it, each time you want to do something with it?
[14:39:29] <krazyj> what if i want to, say, add a label and an imgâ€¦ i just chain it together to make one big command?
[14:39:39] <alexr2> krazyj, yes
[14:40:21] <krazyj> alexr2: thanks for helping a noob :)
[14:40:28] <alexr2> shoky, i'm working in python as my backend.  i think when it builds the page, it converts all attribute quotes to double quotes
[14:40:34] <alexr2> even if i typed it in as single quotes
[14:40:46] <austinallen> wow, python does that, awesome
[14:42:15] <shoky> ?glwtd
[14:42:15] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[14:42:26] <alexr2> hahaha
[14:42:27] <alexr2> thanks
[14:43:36] <domino14> i get these errors in jquery 1.5.1 randomly: attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope
[14:43:39] <domino14> anyone know what that means?
[14:46:05] <Gates> is there an easy what to make on click of a link
[14:46:09] <Gates> text content to popup
[14:46:21] <Gates> overlaying the site in some iphone/desktop friendly way
[14:46:33] <alexr2> Gates, look into window.open
[14:46:46] <alexr2> assuming you want to do it through javascript
[14:47:22] <alexr2> otherwise, target="_blank" on the a tag
[14:48:44] <Gates> will do
[14:49:18] <Gates> alexr2: isnt "window.open" just new window :
[14:49:19] <Gates> \
[14:49:40] <alexr2> oh i didnt' see text content to popup
[14:49:46] <alexr2> you mean send content to a new window?
[14:50:49] <alexr2> hold on
[14:50:50] <alexr2> refresh
[14:51:07] <alexr2> google fancybox
[14:51:16] <austinallen> Has anyone here done any Freelance Work?
[14:51:18] <alexr2> final answer
[14:51:47] <krazyj> what would be the best way to store a string that's a view partial and create a way to pass string vars to it for customization?
[14:52:24] <alexr2> krazyj, are you using zend?
[14:52:30] <krazyj> alexr2: no
[14:53:56] <alexr2> then i have no clue what you're talking about :-P
[14:54:35] <vacho> ajpiano: sir please.
[14:54:41] <krazyj> i guess i could create var menu_item_partial = function(name,icon_image) { return "blah" }
[14:55:07] <vacho> krazyj: why would you set a function to a var?
[14:55:23] <krazyj> vacho: still learning :)
[14:55:34] <vacho> krazyj: ohh, okay, you probably don't want to do that.
[14:55:34] <Bankzilla> you wouldn't be able to pass anything to the function?
[14:55:48] <vacho> krazyj: can you explain what you are trying to do ?
[14:55:52] <krazyj> honestly, looking at the first example here: http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/partial-currys-flashy-cousin/
[14:56:12] <krazyj> vacho: i have a view partialâ€¦ some HTML that's the default layout for a table cell, of sorts.
[14:56:29] <krazyj> and i need to pass that string a name and an icon_image_path to customize it and add it to said table
[14:56:36] <krazyj> so i'm figuring out a pattern to do that
[14:57:00] <vacho> it's always a good idea to pastebin your code.
[14:58:11] <krazyj> vacho: i want to append this string to a menu i'm building, through jqueryâ€¦ https://gist.github.com/66d0188b5c5f2694bb5a
[14:58:22] <krazyj> that's the basic string for each menu item
[14:58:25] <krazyj> which i .append
[14:58:29] <k1ng> it was can anyone confirm if jquery dialog works on mobile/tablet?
[14:58:35] <krazyj> but i want to customize that, of course
[14:59:26] <vacho> krazyj: hmm.. how do you want it to look after you have altered it?
[15:00:18] <krazyj> vacho: "Library", "Menu", etc in the NAME_GOES_HERE area and /images/library_icon.png, etc etc in ICON_PATH_GOES_HERE
[15:00:32] <krazyj> then i want to take said customized string and .append
[15:00:33] <vacho> ok
[15:00:36] <vacho> try this:
[15:01:25] <vacho> jQuery('.icon').attr('src','http://www.domain.com/image.jpg');
[15:02:57] <krazyj> vacho: that's only part of what i'm trying to do.. don't know how to do all the rest :)
[15:04:06] <vacho> krazyj: divide and conquer, did that work?
[15:04:32] <krazyj> first i need to construct the div so i can see it in my layout.. still figuring that
[15:06:54] <poke> if i have an object with opacity 0.5, var i = $(this).css("opacity"); should set i to 0.5, right?
[15:07:03] <poke> or will i be a string?
[15:11:43] <Bankzilla> why dont you try it and find out
[15:13:16] <poke> i did and it's not working :(
[15:14:35] <poke> hmm
[15:14:51] <poke> can javascript compare strings to ints?
[15:15:28] <ninjaprecision> Good afternoon all. Just wondering if anyone has ever run into a safari issue and the document ready call (and safari triggering too early.)
[15:17:11] <johnkpaul> poke: yes
[15:17:19] <johnkpaul> ?eval "1" == 1
[15:17:20] <bot-t> johnkpaul: true
[15:18:28] <remlabm> having issue with a deferred. ajax call want to get the success data param out side of the ajax scope.. any ideas?
[15:18:39] <Bankzilla> poke: appears that it will always be returned as 1
[15:19:32] <johnkpaul> remlabm: what do you mean by outside of the ajax scope?
[15:20:25] <poke> ah i just used parseFloat($(this).css("opacity") and it works fine
[15:20:46] <poke> maybe a bit indirect, but it gets the job done
[15:22:21] <remlabm> https://www.stypi.com/remlabm/test.js
[15:22:29] <remlabm> johnkpaul: ^
[15:23:46] <johnkpaul> remlabm: you can't do that exactly, that's the reason that the deferred API is used
[15:23:59] <johnkpaul> that ajax call is completed well after var t = Test.load() has finished executing
[15:24:11] <johnkpaul> what you need to do is something like....
[15:24:11] <remlabm> johnkpaul: do you know anyway i can accomplish this?
[15:24:20] <remlabm> you can edit that document below
[15:24:25] <johnkpaul> test.load().then(function(t){//do everything with t here});
[15:25:26] <johnkpaul> remlabm: I added it to your document
[15:25:35] <remlabm> thank you
[15:25:38] <johnkpaul> let me know if you have questions about what I did
[15:25:39] <johnkpaul> np
[15:30:48] <javalover> is there a way to do .load without it being into a frame?
[15:30:59] <javalover> or do i have to create an empty div?
[15:31:23] <javalover> guess i could just create a loader div...
[15:31:59] <sunbeam> Which jq plugin can i best use if i have a header navigation, and when on clicking of any of the 4 links i would like to move to the belonging chapter. Eg. when i click <a class="work" href="#">Work</a> it should slide (all on the same page) to #chapter_work
[15:33:52] <javalover> sunbeam what are you saying?
[15:34:19] <ColKurtz> sunbeam would like a plugin that smooth scrolls
[15:34:22] <javalover> it sounds like you want to use .load but i'm confused "it should slide..."
[15:34:26] <javalover> ohhhhhhhh
[15:34:26] <sunbeam> eg. someone clicks on header navigation item Contact. It should slide the page down till div#contact is there
[15:34:38] <javalover> oh shit i have something like this
[15:34:50] <javalover> but it's too confusing for me to elaborate on but I do one sec
[15:34:56] <sunbeam> ok
[15:35:01] <domino14> i get these errors in jquery 1.5.1 randomly: attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope

[15:42:17] <xp_prg> how do I convert a javascript associative array/hash to a url args string?
[15:46:56] <Domain4sale>  NLLL.com domain is for sale http://www.ebay.com/itm/330722589905
[15:58:59] <vacho> $( "#radio" ).buttonset(); how do I turn that into LIVE?
[15:59:22] <vacho> $("#dialog-form").load("dialog.ajax.php",{ type: type, tel: 55 } ).dialog("open");
[15:59:31] <vacho> does that dialog function have a callback?? can't find it in the docs!
[15:59:58] <AllStruck> is there a way I can skip around Same origin policy to scape HTML from an external domain with .ajax?
[16:00:31] <AllStruck> vacho: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog ?
[16:00:39] <vacho> AllStruck: yes
[16:01:23] <Whirl3d> krazyj, I'm sorry I don't know if I can help you without a test case . Create a fiddle and I'll try to help
[16:01:27] <ale_> this is the code: http://pastebin.com/yEbN7BwP
[16:01:36] <vacho> AllStruck: yes!
[16:02:11] <Whirl3d> ale_ what's not working on it?
[16:02:15] <austinallen> Do anyone of u guys a Freelencer??
[16:02:19] <ale_> Hello! I am trying to send a form via ajax, but it's not being sent. This is the code: http://pastebin.com/yEbN7BwP
[16:02:36] <ale_> Whirl3d: It's not being sent!
[16:02:54] <Whirl3d> that's because the plugin you are using doesn't sent it, maybe?
[16:02:57] <ale_> Whirl3d: It doesn't do anything
[16:02:59] <AllStruck> austinallen: lots of freelancers here I'd bet, I'm one
[16:03:05] <ale_> Whirl3d: yes, maybe!
[16:03:09] <Whirl3d> you need an action attribute on your form
[16:03:22] <Whirl3d> then you ajaxForm plugin will know what to do
[16:03:22] <ale_> Whirl3d: no, it's not compulsory
[16:03:35] <ale_> check the url attr on the ajaxForm
[16:04:02] <austinallen> Really AllStruck, Do you succeed in it, how much do you make, and what do you do?? Im Curious if i can start Freelencing
[16:04:08] <Whirl3d> Without seeing the code for the ajaxForm plugin, how do you expect us to divine what is happening?
[16:04:26] <Whirl3d> It obviously grabs the submit event on the form, but what does it take to submit it?
[16:04:38] <Whirl3d> Is there part of the ajaxForm api that handles that?
[16:04:57] <AllStruck> austinallen: I work my ass off and make little money currently.
[16:05:03] <someprimetime> without using a global variable how can i pass a variable to my hover() callback (e.g. when a user hovers on i set a variable, when they hover off, i want to do something with that variable in the callback function)
[16:05:32] <AllStruck> austinallen: if you have the ability to sustain through long periods like that and enjoy the work, you might be able to freelance I'd say
[16:05:38] <Whirl3d> what would the scope of the variable be?
[16:05:52] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, you could use the data object on the common parent
[16:06:01] <Whirl3d> *parent or ancestor
[16:06:14] <someprimetime> eh yeah actually i'm gonna do this another way.. this looks like it'll get sloppy quickly
[16:06:19] <someprimetime> but good solution though thx Whirl3d
[16:06:30] <Whirl3d> np
[16:09:32] <AllStruck> Is there an actual way around the Same Origin Policy aside from just writing a local server-side script to get my data from?
[16:16:04] <studio> hi, i'm trying to send some data with a $.post request via a url with parameters - is this possible as the receiving script doesn't seem to receive any post data?
[16:17:03] <ColKurtz> AllStruck, JSONP
[16:17:43] <AllStruck> NSFW words in this: http://jsfiddle.net/PShWL/24/
[16:18:29] <ColKurtz> AllStruck, there's this proxy that turns JSON into JSONP so you can access it from a different domain: https://github.com/maxogden/jsonpify
[16:18:40] <ColKurtz> But I wouldn't use that in production.
[16:19:03] <AllStruck> ColKurtz: interesting, but yeah I'm going to have this running on my website I think
[16:19:20] <ColKurtz> So yeah, unless it's offered as JSONP
[16:19:32] <ColKurtz> then you'll need to use your own server-side proxy
[16:20:06] <AllStruck> Yeah I thought that might be the case, just wanted to make sure I wasn't unaware of some cool solution. Thanks a million ColKurtz :)
[16:21:10] <ColKurtz> If it's a public feed it just might be JSONP, worth giving it a shot before writing server-side script
[16:22:43] <AllStruck> ColKurtz: would it be listed as an alternate or something, how would I check?
[16:23:45] <ColKurtz> use the jquery $.ajax method
[16:23:58] <ColKurtz> with dataType: 'jsonp'
[16:24:15] <ColKurtz> and it magically works just like JSON
[16:24:19] <ColKurtz> from a different domain.

[16:54:13] <jrockjiggz2> vacho: put it in the callback
[16:54:28] <vacho> ajax callback?
[16:54:50] <jrockjiggz2> or search your data, data.find('tr:has(th)')
[16:55:05] <jrockjiggz2> in ajax callback
[16:55:19] <vacho> what is the name of the callback function??
[16:56:22] <vacho> jrockjiggz2: can't find the function name in the docs.
[16:57:49] <jrockjiggz2> paste some code, depends how you are implementing your ajax
[16:57:50] <vacho> it worked now
[17:00:37] <InphraRed> I always felt that ajax is grammatically incorrect. 'a' implies singularity while jax is obviously references more than one Jack.  I think it should either be ajak or djax.

[19:04:30] <imitkit> hello
[19:06:32] <coldhead> Thanks for using freenode.
[19:06:56] <tw2113> oh freenode
[19:07:00] <tw2113> oh yeah, hi coldhead
[19:07:10] <coldhead> hallo
[19:22:33] <_Meowth_> Hey guys, I was wondering if there's a way of watching when an element changes. Lke <div id="profile-name"><h2>Chris x Hearts</h2></div> and I have an ajax request that switches between the profiles, the name gets updated. What I'm trying to do is when the name changes make it go to another callback function. I know there's the jquery-watch plugin but that didn't work for me
[19:23:56] <ColKurtz> _Meowth_: sounds like there's a better way you could approach that.
[19:24:20] <ColKurtz> Why don't you have the other callback function go along with the rest of the profile change?
[19:24:53] <coldhead> _Meowth_: the way i prefer to do that is to fire a custom event in the ajax handler that is actually manipulating the dom $('something').trigger('namechange')
[19:24:56] <coldhead> or some such
[19:25:13] <ColKurtz> ^ that's one way.
[19:25:16] <coldhead> and then $('somesuch').on('namechange', function () ... )
[19:27:40] <_Meowth_> coldhead Unfortunately it's a drupal plugin jQFX ImageFlow, the captions doesn't seem to be displaying underneath the pictures I figured i could just write a custome "watcher" and have it auto display once the profile loads lol
[19:28:35] <coldhead> _Meowth_: don't tell anyone i have ever done this but for 3rd party plugins like that i add a global ajax handler that runs anytime ajax occurs
[19:28:57] <coldhead> and that handler checks for the thing that might have changed and fires the custom event if necessary
[19:29:06] <coldhead> but shhh
[19:29:18] <coldhead> you didn't hear it from me
[19:33:08] <_Meowth_> coldhead that's wicked scary knowledge but I appreciate it!
[19:33:25] <_Meowth_> so just bind the ajax? *googles*
[19:34:19] <coldhead> _Meowth_: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[19:36:12] <skrassifras> what's the proper way to call a plugin's method from within another method? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring as a plugin design reference
[19:40:19] <coldhead> skrassifras: it probably depends how your code is structured
[19:40:35] <coldhead> i'd lean towards just calling it the same way you would externally, just for readability
[19:40:50] <coldhead> rather than trying to disambiguate `this` or a scope chain
[19:43:03] <skrassifras> thanks sounds great!
[19:44:06] <box> hello
[19:45:08] <tw2113> hi
[19:45:17] <skrassifras> is there an easy way to get each element in a jquery object in its own jquery object?
[19:47:19] <box> I'm having a problem with http://pastebin.com/SAShiwFP . When mod_pagespeed is enabled, the class "external" and target "_blank" get added to hyperlinks. Please advise?
[19:48:40] <box> All the Apache module does is remove whitespace - the var sitepath remains the same before and after enabling it.
[19:50:20] <systemfault> skrassifras: Hmm, perhaps      $.map(nodeArray, $)
[20:02:30] <guy> I have an element div.overlay. I want to copy this element on page load to a variable. Then say I do some changes to div.overlay (change width, manipulate DOM elements inside, etc.). Now, I want to reset the changes by replacing the modified object with the copy I made at the beginning. How do I achieve copy and DOM replacement?
[20:03:01] <Aristata> Does anyone here have any idea how to pull in a blogger feed via javascript? I have been searching for some type of plugin but nothing turns up!
[20:06:51] <coldhead> ?replacewith @ guy
[20:06:51] <bot-t> guy, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[20:06:56] <mike817> is there a reason why $("#ElementName").show().focus() doesn't work?
[20:07:20] <coldhead> Aristata: if the server is remote you need to find a jsonp interface to it
[20:07:39] <coldhead> and if it's local you should be able to use regular ajax and parse the xml (or whatever it is)
[20:07:40] <Aristata> Damn
[20:07:46] <Aristata> Its not local
[20:07:52] <coldhead> you need jsonp
[20:07:55] <coldhead> ?sop workarounds
[20:07:55] <bot-t> workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[20:07:56] <Aristata> I was hoping there would be some sort of plugion
[20:08:00] <coldhead> or something from there ^^
[20:08:08] <Aristata> Cool thanks!
[20:08:12] <coldhead> the plugin can't get around the jsonp requirement
[20:08:21] <coldhead> but its not much trouble to build it yourself
[20:08:30] <coldhead> you might be able to find an RSS parser at least
[20:08:37] <coldhead> to handle the data once you somehow retrieve it
[20:09:06] <coldhead> mike817: jQuery's focus() is different to the native DOM focus()
[20:09:20] <coldhead> you probably just need .show().get(0).focus()
[20:09:27] <coldhead> to get at the native one
[20:10:01] <mike817> hmm i thought focus with no arguments was the same as native focus
[20:14:45] <coldhead> you thought wrong, mike817
[20:14:59] <coldhead> it triggers any handlers you have bound to the focus event
[20:15:04] <coldhead> but it doesn't actually focus
[20:15:20] <coldhead> happily it's easily remedied and all is well forever
[20:15:25] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[20:20:35] <guy> coldhead: anything you can spot wrong with my aproarch? https://gist.github.com/e4da9739d3c0d81e1e63 I left only the relevant bits
[20:20:49] <guy> at some random point I get an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'contains' of undefined"
[20:21:41] <coldhead> that's what i was going to say, how about some error checking
[20:21:49] <coldhead> checking that thngs aren't undefined
[20:21:55] <coldhead> checking that elements exist
[20:22:15] <coldhead> then you won't have to find out where that error is occuring because it won't happen :D
[20:22:34] <guy> huh. I figured the error.
[20:22:43] <RandalSchwartz> does it actually work to be assigning to the object and already refer to elements of that onbject?
[20:22:52] <guy> $('.app-overlay').hide().replaceWith( ay.overlay.clone() );
[20:22:58] <guy> This should fix it.
[20:23:03] <RandalSchwartz> a.b.c = { d: a.b.c.e, e: a.b.c.d }
[20:23:06] <RandalSchwartz> that seems like it can't work
[20:23:23] <RandalSchwartz> and yet, you have it there in your snippet
[20:23:46] <guy> RandalSchwartz: it should work. There is nothing wrong with that code.
[20:24:00] <RandalSchwartz> where does it get the value before the assignment is finished?
[20:24:20] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, because they are all functions
[20:24:30] <RandalSchwartz> so the value isn't needed until teh fucntion fires
[20:24:33] <guy> well, no, not really because of that.
[20:24:36] <RandalSchwartz> that's the point
[20:24:39] <RandalSchwartz> well yes, really because of that
[20:24:43] <RandalSchwartz> otherwise you coulnd't do it
[20:24:54] <RandalSchwartz> a.b.c = { d: a.b.c.e, e: 14 }
[20:24:56] <RandalSchwartz> that won't put 14 in d
[20:25:03] <RandalSchwartz> since there's no a.b.c.e yet
[20:25:15] <guy> I am pretty sure a.b.c = { e: 14, d: a.b.c.e } would work
[20:25:23] <RandalSchwartz> I'm pretty sure it won't
[20:25:30] <guy> too lazy to test it.
[20:25:30] <RandalSchwartz> because the object has to be formed before the assignment can happen
[20:25:39] <RandalSchwartz> so there's no a.b.c.e yet
[20:25:54] <coldhead> ?eval a = {b: '1', c: a.b}
[20:25:56] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: a is not defined
[20:26:00] <RandalSchwartz> there ya go
[20:26:01] <coldhead> ?cc
[20:26:01] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[20:26:04] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[20:26:21] <RandalSchwartz> your code looked scarily like that
[20:26:26] <RandalSchwartz> but then I see it's all inside functions, so ok
[20:26:34] <RandalSchwartz> no problem until the function is *invoked*
[20:26:42] <RandalSchwartz> but by then, the object has been assigned
[20:26:43] <guy> Just wasted 15 seconds testing it.. it works. Though I knew that already.
[20:26:57] <RandalSchwartz> guy - "it works", which?
[20:26:59] <RandalSchwartz> your code
[20:27:03] <RandalSchwartz> or the code in the channel?
[20:27:06] <coldhead> 15 seconds isn't wasted if it gives you a smug feeling of superiority, guy
[20:27:08] <coldhead> don't sweat it
[20:27:12] <guy> https://gist.github.com/991ae823cfee6bb9145b console.log(ay.fn.overlay.b);
[20:27:46] <RandalSchwartz> yes, BECAUSE THEY ARE FUNCTIONS
[20:27:49] <RandalSchwartz> deferred access
[20:27:51] <RandalSchwartz> not immediate acces
[20:27:56] <RandalSchwartz> I was worried about immediate access
[20:28:05] <guy> ah. I see what you mean.
[20:28:40] <RandalSchwartz> if you don't fire the function until after the object is defined, then cool, you can get away with sibling access like that.
[20:28:45] <guy> yaya
[20:28:52] <RandalSchwartz> but see above in coldhead's example
[20:29:25] <coldhead> how dare you say "yaya" to Randal, have some respect
[20:30:04] <guy> Did I mention anyone that I am staying in Manila? Literally afraid of leaving the hotel.
[20:30:15] <RandalSchwartz> people have said worse to me :)
[20:31:15] <guy> Looking good for your age, RandalSchwartz.
[20:31:22] <coldhead> :D
[20:33:04] <mike817> coldhead: it turns out focus() does work, the element needed a tabindex
[20:33:54] <coldhead> oh sorry mike817
[20:34:01] <coldhead> it's literally my first day using jQuery
[20:34:11] <coldhead> glad you got there in the end
[20:46:35] <grateful> this site is completely ran off ajax , and on a few of the "pages" that get pulled in by ajax have markup that needs to manipulated by a jQuery slider plugin. but its not working. by jQuery   www.flutterly.com is the url with trapschl / trapschl, to get into the directory . for example http://flutterly.com/#!/locations/tsny-boston/ doesnt work. http://flutterly.com/locations/tsny-boston/ does
[20:46:35] <grateful> work because its refreshing everything. while the #! is a trigger for the ajax to do its thing
[20:47:15] <grateful> i think the problem is that $(function(){}); is already called at the begining and not fired off each time so the plug in doesnt work
[20:47:16] <sylon> does jquery 1.7 have anything built it to read query string values?
[20:48:08] <grateful> please PM if you would like or answering in channel is just fine
[20:49:42] <coldhead> grateful: your diagnosis is probably correct, you should wrap the code that sets up the slider in a function and call it whenever you load new content
[20:51:04] <coldhead> sylon: i don't believe there's anything builtin, but this is easy enough to add http://paulgueller.com/2011/04/26/parse-the-querystring-with-jquery/
[21:01:05] <grateful> coldhead: thank you did you see the problem with those two links?
[21:01:27] <steveoliver> FireFox strangeness: <select> list options disappear after selecting the drop-down elements on carclearance.com/get-dealer-price-quotes -- maybe it's jQuery?  maybe not?  Can't figure this one out.
[21:01:34] <steveoliver> http://carclearance.com/get-dealer-price-quotes
[21:02:28] <coldhead> grateful: i'm trying to look busy at my own work just now :)
[21:06:30] <nathanb> hi, with the newer version of jquery the plugin livequery can be disregarded using the .on ?
[21:07:46] <coldhead> mostly, nathanb
[21:07:55] <coldhead> for all intents and porpoises
[21:09:38] <nathanb> J(document).on('load', J('form').dirtyForms() )
[21:10:21] <nathanb> would replace J('form').livequery(function(){	  J(this).dirtyForms();	});
[21:10:22] <coldhead> that won't work
[21:10:33] <nathanb> what would I attach it too
[21:10:37] <coldhead> dirtyForms will be called immediately
[21:10:43] <nathanb> Yeah i thought so
[21:10:59] <coldhead> you still need to wrap it in an anonymous function
[21:11:00] <coldhead> as before
[21:11:19] <coldhead> and you don't have to use document
[21:11:32] <coldhead> J('form').on('load', function () {...})
[21:12:04] <coldhead> load MIGHT be one of the cases where it's still better to use liveQuery though
[21:12:07] <coldhead> i'm not sure
[21:12:43] <nathanb> well
[21:12:45] <nathanb> its not load
[21:13:00] <nathanb> I just want it to attach if I add elements to the pay
[21:13:01] <coldhead> okaaay
[21:13:08] <nathanb> *page
[21:13:32] <nathanb> but I think my issue is dirty forms doesn't check hidden fields
[21:16:12] <binaryfus10nz> var $goURL = $(this).attr('href'); how do I take the href and find the last two "/'s" and remove the last one.. and change second to last to a #
[21:16:27] <binaryfus10nz> I am trying stuff like
[21:16:27] <binaryfus10nz> 		$goURL.val().replace("/", "#");		 but no luck
[21:19:30] <nathanb> yeah it was the hidden fields found a way around it by triggering the change event when I set the hidden field :D
[21:20:13] <nathanb> replace will do the first / it finds i believe
[21:22:19] <binaryfus10nz> how do I say find last / and remove
[21:22:24] <binaryfus10nz> then find last / and replace to #
[21:23:01] <versatiletech> I'm trying to figure out the callback to check if a file type wasn't accept by jQuery File Upload https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options. I've used done and always callbacks, but none of them are called if the file is rejected, but it is called if the file is accepted. Anyone familiar with this plugin?
[21:24:45] <wkmanire`> binaryfus10nz: Why do you want to do that?
[21:24:54] <binaryfus10nz> wkmanire`, http://ogkexpress.com/services/#7
[21:25:10] <binaryfus10nz> on that link im trying to make it so i can click a service and it changes url to /services/#service-name
[21:25:20] <binaryfus10nz> and then will slidedown the appropriate div
[21:25:43] <binaryfus10nz> right now im reverting to having to use part of an ID
[21:25:48] <binaryfus10nz> would love to use proper name from href
[21:26:38] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: Just a sec, I'm looking for a library for you.
[21:26:47] <wkmanire> I think I saw something on microjs for dealing with hash components.
[21:26:48] <binaryfus10nz> BBQ ?
[21:26:52] <binaryfus10nz> I dont want something heavy
[21:27:05] <wkmanire> microjs.com specializes in all things not heavy.
[21:27:05] <binaryfus10nz> I just need to string manip the href and rest I can do in a few lines
[21:27:13] <binaryfus10nz> k sounds good
[21:27:21] <wkmanire> If you haven't seen it you should check it out.
[21:27:39] <wkmanire> It is essentially a huge listing of tiny javascript "libraries" that do all kinds of useful things.
[21:27:50] <grateful> cold head, im having difficultues trying to do with what you said because the jQuery image slider is control by a wp back end
[21:28:04] <grateful> and to initalize is it uses that stoopid short code
[21:28:47] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: No, not seeing it.
[21:29:02] <grateful> anyway just to refrsh the doc.ready() ?
[21:30:28] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: There is a library on microjs for dealing with hashchanged events that could be helpful for you, but I think a simple regex replace can be used for manipulating that string.
[21:33:24] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: #([^\?]+|$)
[21:33:27] <wkmanire> give that regex a shot.
[21:33:32] <binaryfus10nz> not sure how
[21:33:42] <wkmanire> it should capture the hash portion of the URL that you pass in.
[21:33:48] <wkmanire> but if you have a query string it will leave it a lone.
[21:33:51] <wkmanire> alone*
[21:34:17] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: Well, time to learn regular expression and capture groups. :)
[21:34:52] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: Here is a hint. var myRegEx = /#([^\?]+|$)/;
[21:34:54] <binaryfus10nz> http://collabedit.com/jyyaa
[21:35:01] <binaryfus10nz> thats my code, can you try to help me :?
[21:46:01] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: Still there?
[21:46:26] <binaryfus10nz> yes
[21:46:42] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: Did you see my last update in the editor there?
[21:47:03] <wkmanire> I gave you more or less the complete solution to the problem you stated.
[21:47:15] <binaryfus10nz> hmm
[21:47:39] <binaryfus10nz> this is sort of the reverse of what I need
[21:47:45] <binaryfus10nz> but I feel bad to keep bugging you
[21:48:25] <wkmanire> The reverse?
[21:48:43] <wkmanire> You said you want to replace the hash portion of a url with something else.
[21:48:53] <wkmanire> he he he, that's what I showed ya how to do.
[21:49:09] <binaryfus10nz> lol no where did I say that?
[21:49:13] <binaryfus10nz> I said I need to remove trailing /
[21:49:17] <binaryfus10nz> and then change last / TO #
[21:49:33] <wkmanire> Oh, jeese. I'm freaking out of it.
[21:49:35] <wkmanire> You're right.
[21:49:35] <binaryfus10nz> :( sorry for confusion
[21:49:40] <wkmanire> Not your fault.
[21:49:59] <wkmanire> Just a sec, I'll fix it.
[21:50:05] <binaryfus10nz> thx
[21:58:32] <wkmanire> binaryfus10nz: Sorry for they delay. I'm getting tied up here.
[21:58:46] <binaryfus10nz> honestly man take your time and/or all good
[21:58:54] <binaryfus10nz> you like the idea tho ?
[21:59:11] <binaryfus10nz> I did something similar with:
[21:59:19] <binaryfus10nz> click menus
[22:02:18] <coldhead> grateful: $(document).trigger('ready') ?
[22:02:22] <coldhead> maybe that works
[22:02:23] <coldhead> ?tias
[22:02:24] <bot-t> Try It And See
[22:11:11] <Agamemnus> Hello, does anyone know where jQuery.css is in the source code?
[22:12:06] <Cork> Agamemnus: its a group of css files
[22:12:21] <Agamemnus> what?!@
[22:12:28] <Agamemnus> that doesn't make any sense
[22:12:29] <Cork> and i suspect your talking about jquery-ui
[22:12:39] <Cork> cause jquery doesn't have any css dependency
[22:12:43] <Agamemnus> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js
[22:12:47] <Agamemnus> jQuery.css
[22:12:53] <Cork> there is none
[22:13:07] <Agamemnus> jQuery.css(offsetParent, "position")
[22:13:17] <Cork> ah the function
[22:13:22] <Cork> ?src .css
[22:13:22] <bot-t> Line#6313 - "jQuery.fn.css = function( name, value ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6313
[22:13:37] <Cork> bah... bots down
[22:14:20] <Cork> line 6573 in your file
[22:14:30] <Agamemnus> ?src .style
[22:14:31] <bot-t> Line#1217 - "opacity: /^0.55$/.test( a.style.opacity )," - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1217
[22:14:40] <Cork> style is dom
[22:14:55] <Cork> and you'll find that multible times
[22:15:01] <Cork> you can curCSS
[22:15:05] <Agamemnus> jquery.css depends on .style and .access
[22:15:05] <Cork> *you want
[22:15:30] <Cork> check line 6672
[22:16:00] <dns-away> Hello
[22:16:40] <Agamemnus> oh
[22:16:49] <dns-away> I need some help
[22:17:21] <Cork> ?ask @ dns-away
[22:17:21] <bot-t> dns-away, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:17:37] <dns-away> :-)
[22:17:38] <dns-away> Thanks
[22:18:04] <Agamemnus> so then I need jQuery.camelCase, jQuery.cssHooks, and jQuery.cssProps
[22:18:06] <Agamemnus> IT NEVER ENDS
[22:18:23] <Cork> not really
[22:18:28] <Cork> those are just arrays
[22:18:33] <Cork> you need currCSS like i said
[22:18:45] <dns-away> How i can get the latest id on class with name='Commet' in ID "#Test"
[22:19:01] <Cork> dns-away: latest id?
[22:19:08] <Cork> dns-away: id is suppose to be page uniq
[22:19:21] <Cork> if you have the same id twice or more its invalid
[22:19:26] <Agamemnus> I don't understand what you're talking about.
[22:19:30] <Agamemnus> I need curCSS?
[22:19:35] <Cork> yes
[22:19:39] <Agamemnus> ???
[22:19:44] <Cork> Agamemnus: check the end of the css: function
[22:19:46] <StevenCodes> Agamemnus,  Look it up
[22:19:49] <Cork> its calling that function
[22:19:57] <Cork> and its where all the magic happens
[22:19:59] <Agamemnus> ok, so I replaced that with the jquery css function
[22:20:07] <Cork> not really
[22:20:21] <Agamemnus> but curCSS = jQuery.css
[22:20:23] <Cork> its a chain of events
[22:20:26] <Cork> no
[22:20:27] <dns-away> yes i have #Test { <div class="Comment" ID='Comm1"></div> <div class="Comment" ID='Comm2"></div> } EndID #Test
[22:20:36] <dns-away> i need to get latest comment ID
[22:20:42] <Cork> ah
[22:21:01] <Agamemnus> This is too much.
[22:21:08] <Agamemnus> :(
[22:21:10] <Cork> dns-away: $('.Comment').last().prop('id')
[22:21:22] <Cork> sigh...
[22:21:27] <dns-away> Cork 10x :-0
[22:21:35] <Cork> why can't ppl just check what you ask them to check?? T_T
[22:22:19] <Cork> dns-away: and if you have Comment outside of #test do $('#test .Comment').last().prop('id')
[22:22:45] <dns-away> Yes, Thank you i know it :)
[22:43:39] <jherri> i'm using $.data() in my plugin. can i alter the returned object without returning it back to $.data() and have it "stick"?
[22:48:11] <Cork> jherri: if your using an object sure
[22:48:33] <Cork> .data('key').sub = something
[22:49:40] <jherri> no i mean var data = $( element ).data( "something" ); can i just alter data and have it stick?
[22:50:13] <jherri> or do i need to do $( element ).data( "something", data ) after data.foo = bar;?
[22:50:19] <jherri> i hope that makes sense
[22:50:30] <Cork> jherri: thats what i answerd yes
[22:51:02] <coldhead> jherri: read all of this http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[22:51:04] <Cork> .data('key').sub = something s/key/something/ s/sub/foo/
[22:51:10] <coldhead> you will have no further questions
[22:51:39] <Cork> jherri: it works by how objects work in javascript
[22:53:51] <jherri> thanks :)
[22:58:48] <Carlitta87> does anyone know of a slide that can do pop up images as well?
[23:19:26] <chx> I would like to add a link that would appear over an image when hovering. Is there a plugin?
[23:20:07] <Cork> chx: how do you want the link to be over the image?
[23:20:13] <Cork> a text link? and icon?
[23:20:19] <chx> text link i guess
[23:20:21] <Cork> just hovering the image?
[23:20:36] <chx> yeah you bring the cursor over the image and a clickable text appears
[23:20:37] <Cork> chx: just do it with css
[23:20:46] <chx> oh
[23:21:13] <Cork> add a wrapper div around the image and use mouseenter/mouseout to show the text link
[23:21:50] <Cork> you should prob find similar solutions in any image galery plugin out there
[23:22:35] <chx> :hover right, right
[23:23:01] <chx> I havent climbed out of the IE crater yet. Sorry :)
[23:23:24] <Cork> chx: no you might want to use the jquery mouseenter event
[23:23:33] <chx> Cork: better than div:hover?
[23:23:52] <Cork> :hover will hide the element when you hover a child to the element
[23:24:10] <Cork> thought you could make a compound selector to fix that
[23:24:28] <Cork> div:hover, div *:hover
[23:24:42] <Cork> its a matter of taste
[23:32:04] <dns-away> Cork, var LastComment = $('#WallID-1 .Article').last().prop('id');, not working
[23:35:47] <Cork> dns-away: and .Article has the id element?
[23:35:53] <Cork> *attribute
[23:36:01] <dns-away> yes, :) .last().attr('id');
[23:36:41] <Cork> dns-away: is there Article elements that doesn't have an id?
[23:37:06] <dns-away> it's is solved already
[23:37:19] <dns-away> Of course, All Articles have own ID
[23:37:32] <Cork> ah so it failed on .prop?
[23:37:43] <dns-away> i don't know really
[23:37:52] <Cork> your using an old version of jquery?
[23:37:53] <dns-away> but with attr, it work :-)
[23:39:15] <dns-away> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js, maybe it is latest :-)
[23:39:56] <gloomer> assuming makes an ..
[23:40:01] <gloomer> ohh wait your right
[23:40:49] <dns-away> I have more one question, how i can disable New Line in TextArea with key press=Enter(13)
[23:41:07] <dns-away> I need to change newline with (submit) like a input
