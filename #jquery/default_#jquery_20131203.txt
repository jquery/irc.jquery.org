[00:54:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone awake
[00:57:53] <joroci> nope
[00:57:55] <joroci> :P
[01:00:04] <ahandy> i have two arrows that need to slide a div. i managed to make that work and also continuously slide a div if it's a continuous click, but the sliding is not that continuous, so it slides, stops for a fraction of a second and slides again
[01:00:08] <ahandy> what's the best way to make it continuous
[01:03:23] <sacho> do you have a test case?
[01:05:38] <intellilogic> $(this).parent().select('a')   ///how to select off the parent?
[01:07:29] <joroci> why not select just the a:)
[01:08:01] <airandfingers> intellilogic: find() or children()
[01:09:36] <intellilogic> joroci: wouldn't that be nice, LOL.  On click of anchor, I want to select the others that are all within LI tags.
[01:10:00] <ahandy> sacho, http://kaleido.co/web// scroll down to DESIGN
[01:10:05] <ahandy> and continuously click on the right arrow
[01:11:45] <joroci> intellilogic make a test case with html you have
[01:15:35] <ahandy> can someone take a look at http://kaleido.co/web// and check out the DESIGN page's right arrow, i want the sliding to be continuous, any help?
[01:17:19] <ripthejacker> how do I highlight text inside an input textfield using jquery?
[01:18:03] <ripthejacker> acutally I wanted to do a 'copy to clipboard', but after extensive search, figured the only way to do it on click is to use flash.
[01:18:41] <intellilogic> joroci: with this function, it wouldn't be safe to asusme the HTML was consistant.
[01:20:56] <ripthejacker> Ok gotit
[01:20:59] <Radditz> hello
[01:21:06] <Radditz> is there a method in jquery to do a deep stringify
[01:23:38] <intellilogic> "deep" stringify?
[01:24:03] <Radditz> so I get a complete copy when I parse it
[01:35:11] <Guest12834> hello
[02:02:29] <jop008> Can someone give feedback on this site http://www.happyaway.nl site developed with jquery mobile. Is the font size good? Layout optimalization tips are welcome
[02:04:56] <Radditz> hello
[02:05:00] <Radditz> does extends do a copy?
[02:05:15] <Radditz> I have read on stackoverflow that extends is similar to JSON.parse(JSON.stringify
[02:05:22] <Radditz> but I read the documentation and it seems differente
[02:07:54] <shoky> Radditz: $.extend is suitable for your case:  var axis_0 = $.extend({}, boolean_axis);
[02:08:26] <Radditz> thank you shoky, I will try that
[02:35:32] <Koopz> can someone tell me if you were able to use attr() in order to choose values of an select back in the days of jquery 1.4.4?
[02:36:03] <Koopz> i should use prop() to make it work, shouldn't i?
[02:36:10] <ghostlines> hello, when do you and don't you add a . at the beginning of your class selectors like $('.classname')? in my CSS I used a dot but in jquery it seems like I don't need to add the dot
[02:39:37] <shoky> Koopz: .val() would be my choice
[02:39:57] <Koopz> wow... why didn't i think of that?
[02:40:31] <Koopz> ...and why didn't the developer of that old deprecated jquery plugin think of that...
[02:41:02] <shoky> ghostlines: you need the dot if you're writing a selector. so when doing a query like $('.classname') you need to put in a selector, so it's with the dot
[02:41:07] <bigbugjava> Hi, I have a global variable that is defined like this "var Myinfo = {};  Myinfo.FBName = {};  Myinfo.FBID = {};", During the script(Facebook API) I use console.log(response.id) and it works, also "Myinfo.FBID = response.id;" and then console.log(Myinfo.FBID) works, but if I try to use it later on or console.log it from broswer debugger, I get an object with nothing inside... any clues?
[02:41:23] <shoky> ghostlines: when calling a method like addClass which takes as argument the class name (NOT a selector) then it's without the dot
[02:42:37] <ghostlines> ohhhh thanks that helps a lot!, exactly by the addClass method I didn't have to add dots indeed :P
[02:57:26] <mtj_> hi peeps, can someone give me a jquery brainslap here….
[02:57:31] <mtj_> why do i need to append a [0] to get my :last element, like this..
[02:57:32] <mtj_> div = $(this).find('div:last')[0];
[02:57:38] <mtj_> rather than, what i expected, like this...
[02:57:39] <mtj_> div = $(this).find('div:last');
[02:59:21] <mtj_> without the [0], 'div' seems to be an array, rather than an object - this this to be expected?
[02:59:40] <shoky> mtj_:  it's a jquery object. they are array-like
[03:00:29] <shoky> (even if there is only one element)
[03:00:57] <mtj_> jebus, thats news to me O_o
[03:04:02] <mtj_> and thanks shoky, for the info :)
[03:04:09] <mtj_> so, a jquery object can only be accessed successfully by explicitly adding  a [0] to the end of it?
[03:04:17] <shoky> no
[03:04:37] <shoky> the [0] gets you the first element in the jquery object
[03:04:49] <shoky> you can't call jquery methods on that
[03:05:18] <mtj_> ah, ok...
[03:05:47] <shoky> if by "accessed successfully" you mean "access the first element in the jquery object", then sure :P
[03:06:05] <shoky> well, .get(0) would do the same
[03:07:32] <mtj_> aah - so its find() that always returns an array of elements - even if its just one element
[03:07:57] <mtj_> i think thats what confused me, here...
[03:08:11] <shoky> not just find()
[03:08:21] <shoky> also $(anything)
[03:08:37] <shoky> $(this)  is also an array-like jquery object
[03:09:26] <fedeK> Hi
[03:09:42] <mtj_> shoky, heh, ok… i'm bumping into some gaps in my jq knowledge here
[03:10:03] <mtj_> thanks again, ill have a read-up on your advice
[03:11:20] <fedeK> have a code that worked on 1.3.2 and does not on 2.0.3.
[03:11:21] <fedeK> 		if ($("#x").attr("checked")){
[03:11:34] <shoky> fedeK: change attr to prop
[03:11:41] <fedeK> thanks !!

[03:49:49] <vsgill> I have some jquery code to display the nav on the mobile
[03:50:04] <vsgill> the thing is the nav are in different places, can I pull in the list into the mobile div container?

[03:58:37] <fabioportieri> nvm solved
[03:58:58] <doberman> I have an issue in IE11 with $.ajax CORS request. It works fine in all other IE versions, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera. I get "Error: Access is denied." in status. Any idea/workaround?
[03:59:49] <fabioportieri> no, not solved, even by making the anonymous function to work, still get the same error
[04:00:50] <fabioportieri> updated http://jsfiddle.net/SNma8/
[04:01:23] <Cork> doberman: post or get?
[04:01:59] <doberman> Cork: I need to use both, but for now the problem is on GET.
[04:03:06] <Cork> well i know ie uses xdomain for cross domains as it doesn't support the normal cors headers
[04:03:15] <Cork> not sure if they've fixed that in ie11
[04:03:39] <doberman> Cork: XDomainRequest is not present on IE11, it's undefined.
[04:03:46] <Cork> nice
[04:04:48] <doberman> So.. any idea?
[04:05:29] <Cork> according to mdsn ie should support the standard since ie10
[04:05:36] <Cork> so no, no idea
[04:05:47] <Cork> might want to check http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx
[04:06:15] <Cork> might be you depend on cookie for example
[04:11:25] <doberman> Cork: not using cookies
[04:16:01] <k0bi> <shoky> thx its working
[04:22:34] <mikunos> hi guys how have I to intercept the function used by a submit button?
[04:22:57] <Cork> intercept function?
[04:23:13] <mathi> hi
[04:23:14] <Cork> mikunos: you can't really
[04:23:17] <mikunos> In brief, there is some function attached to the submit button in my form that block the submition
[04:23:26] <Cork> mikunos: you can remove the callback from the event queue
[04:23:31] <Cork> but that is about it
[04:23:39] <mathi> when does it make sense to move a funciton in $(document).read() or outside $(document).ready()   ?
[04:23:51] <mikunos> I need to catch up the name of the function
[04:24:08] <Cork> mikunos: not really supported
[04:24:18] <fabioportieri> mathi: if it have to manipulate dom place it inside
[04:24:35] <Cork> mikunos:  the browser doesn't expose the functions added as listeners for events
[04:24:58] <Cork> mikunos: you can kill all events jquery knows about but that is about it
[04:25:05] <Cork> $('button').off('click')
[04:25:36] <Cork> mikunos: though, like i said, that only works if the event listener was added though jquery
[04:26:41] <mathi> fabioportieri, in my case it doesn't manipulate the DOM at all,  but it stores a variable that other functions need to access in $(document).ready(), I don't want to make this variable a javascript global so that's why I placed the function in $(document).ready() even though it doesn't manipulate DOM, just for scoping issues
[04:27:04] <mikunos> Cork I have already tested it. I have disabled the JS from the webmaster toolbar but nothing change. the problem is that my form shows me a simple baloon with a text "This field is required"
[04:27:15] <mikunos> but I have not set this feature
[04:27:26] <mikunos> and I don't know where I have looking for
[04:27:28] <Cork> mathi: you can use (function() {})() if you want to scope several functions together
[04:27:38] <Cork> mathi: then you don't need to use an event listener
[04:27:57] <mathi> Cork, hah... and it replaces my document ready as well ?
[04:28:04] <Cork> mathi: no
[04:28:14] <fabioportieri> it just provides scope
[04:28:15] <Cork> mathi: it creates a namespace nothing else
[04:28:21] <mathi> Cork, I didn't understand about the event listener
[04:28:23] <mathi> then
[04:28:43] <Cork> mathi: ready is a helper function that listens for the DOMContentLoaded event
[04:28:51] <Cork> and if that event doesn't exist listens for onload
[04:29:06] <Cork> and if they have executed once trigger passed functions directly
[04:29:10] <Cork> that is all ready does
[04:29:28] <Cork> mathi: if you don't care about the dom there is no reason to wait for domcontentloaded
[04:29:42] <Cork> there is actually a reason to NOT wait for it
[04:30:05] <mathi> ahhh, got you, for thzt function indeed i don't need to wait for the document ready
[04:30:12] <Cork> mikunos: sounds like you might see the normal html form validate message
[04:30:19] <mathi> but I still have to palce document ready inside (function() {})() right ?
[04:30:25] <Cork> no
[04:30:27] <Cork> well
[04:30:33] <Cork> you do if you want to access the same scope variables
[04:30:37] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/v3eVN/1/ can someone have a look at this, i cant figure out why the audio isnt pausing when pressing the button
[04:30:37] <mathi> (for my other listeners i mean like click etc.)
[04:31:57] <Cork> mathi: if you want to add listeners they need to dom, and yes that needs to happen inside ready
[04:32:42] <mathi> Cork, i'll try that (function () {}) () now :)   thx!
[04:33:02] <Cork> johnline: http://jsfiddle.net/v3eVN/2/
[04:33:40] <johnline> wow cork
[04:33:41] <johnline> ilu
[04:34:04] <Cork> johnline: jquery objects does NOT expose dom functions
[04:34:05] <johnline> the [0] is an id index sort of thing?
[04:34:15] <Cork> it removes the jquery wrapper
[04:34:27] <Cork> and yes it grabs the raw dom element from the jquery array
[04:34:40] <johnline> so would it be smarter to target the <audio> with an id?
[04:34:52] <johnline> i tried that with no luck
[04:34:58] <Cork> johnline: well id's are faster; but it depends on how big the page is
[04:35:08] <johnline> only one audio player
[04:35:18] <Cork> you could do $('audio').each(function() { this.stop() }); if you like
[04:35:36] <Cork> johnline: size of the page not number of audio elements :)
[04:36:06] <Cork> pages with lots of elements => slower to search => id's makes a bigger difference to slow element selectors
[04:36:30] <johnline> ah yes
[04:36:41] <Cork> speed: id > class >> element >> attribute >>>>>>>>>> :contains
[04:36:42] <johnline> its relatively small
[04:37:07] <johnline> i'll add that to notes
[04:37:38] <Cork> johnline: another option that might be nice is to grab the audio element in relation to the button
[04:37:51] <Cork> then the code doesn't have to care about how many you use
[04:37:59] <johnline> the button isnt near the audio sadly
[04:38:44] <Cork> ex .$(this).closest('.wrapper').find('audio')
[04:39:00] <Cork> johnline: btw use <button> for actions
[04:39:13] <johnline> oh
[04:39:35] <mathi> Cork, how about variables ? I have many variables in $(document).ready because they are used only by my listeners (click, etc.), then I have variables in (function () {}) () that are not only used by the listeners   is that ok ?
[04:39:41] <Cork> that way it works better for assistive technologies
[04:39:47] <Cork> johnline: ^
[04:40:17] <johnline> just gotta de-style it now
[04:40:22] <Cork> mathi: think of (function() {})() as your own private global
[04:40:49] <Cork> mathi: variables you declare there are global to all functions defined inside it, but only to them
[04:41:03] <Cork> johnline: ya, it is simple enough
[04:43:10] <chrisdone> is there a way to see if an element *has* a property or not?
[04:43:25] <chrisdone> versus just using .attr() and comparing empty string, which is different
[04:43:57] <chrisdone> probably with the DOMElement i could use hasOwnProperty or w/e, but whether that's cross-browser, i've no idea
[04:44:12] <_rgn> $(elem).is('[attr]')
[04:44:14] <_rgn> or something
[04:44:30] <Cork> or .prop('val') == undefined
[04:44:33] <Cork> i think
[04:44:57] <Cork> chrisdone: btw don't add random properties outside data- to dom elements
[04:45:00] <Aamir> chrisdone: try !!$(this).attr('name') :)
[04:45:05] <Cork> it is a REALLY good way to make things break
[04:45:12] <chrisdone> Cork: ha, i'm actually using data-foo =)
[04:45:20] <Cork> sweet
[04:45:44] <Cork> chrisdone: guess you could check data('foo') then
[04:45:51] <Aamir> chrisdone: if you are checking data attribute than you can use  $element.data().foo   for data-foo
[04:45:51] <chrisdone> Aamir: that will return false for data-foo="". empty string is a valid attribute value, i want to test existence
[04:45:55] <Cork> if($(this).data('foo')) {}
[04:46:14] <Cork> ah
[04:46:19] <Cork> if it exists at all...
[04:46:28] <Aamir> humm than you have to check the value for empty string :/
[04:47:00] <Cork> chrisdone: $(this).data().foo == undefined? :D
[04:47:11] <Aamir> Cork: thats correct
[04:47:12] <chrisdone> seems legit
[04:47:28] <Cork> a bit goofy, but ya
[04:48:16] <Aamir> I just discovered the other day that if you have data-someThing, $element.data().someThing will return nothing. You need to use the lower case attributes i.e. $element.data().something
[04:50:00] <chrisdone> huh, that's not what i have here
[04:50:04] <johnline> does a <button>need to have content?</button>
[04:50:09] <chrisdone> $('#ide').data()
[04:50:10] <chrisdone> Object {project: 386, author: "", backUrl: "http://localhost:3000/user/foobar", exportUrl: "http://localhost:3000/project-export/386/i5Ve6dg1rK", adoptUrl: "http://localhost:3000/adopt-project/386/i5Ve6dg1rK"}
[04:50:15] <chrisdone> Aamir: ^ for example
[04:50:22] <chrisdone> Aamir: the values are data-backUrl, etc
[04:50:42] <chrisdone> Aamir: (author is the field i wanted to test for existence =)
[04:50:58] <ghostlines> hi, can I use .show to display a div that wasn't even on my page yet, that was only in my css?
[04:51:26] <seutje> o.O
[04:51:32] <grafi> o.o
[04:51:44] <fabioportieri> it's jquery not a magic show
[04:51:57] <chrisdone> but jquery *is* magic!!
[04:51:58] <Aamir> ghostlines: no
[04:52:34] <Aamir> chrisdone:  you want to check  if(object.author) { ... }
[04:52:36] <seutje> wish I could make divs from my CSS
[04:52:52] <Aamir> seutje: before, after ?
[04:52:54] <Aamir> :P
[04:53:02] <chrisdone> Aamir: yep
[04:53:11] <seutje> hardly divs, since ur forced to define their display property
[04:54:06] <Aamir> chrisdone: you were talking about data attributes :|
[04:54:20] <Aamir> this is a js object
[04:54:40] <chrisdone> Aamir: hm?
[04:54:54] <Aamir> chrisdone: repeat your question :D
[04:54:57] <chrisdone> Aamir: look at the line before it
[04:55:21] <Aamir> ah I SEE
[04:55:27] <chrisdone> Aamir: it's output from my js console
[04:55:35] <chrisdone> annoying that chrome doesn't include the > =p
[04:55:50] <Aamir> chrisdone: so you can check if($element.data().author) {}
[04:57:00] * Aamir off for lunch
[04:57:23] <fabioportieri> what do you think of that? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4080497/how-can-i-listen-for-a-click-and-hold-in-jquery    i think the solution doesn't work unless i use a setInterval instead a setTimeout
[04:58:42] <johnline> cork, thanks again :D
[04:58:46] <seutje> fabioportieri: huh? you don't want it to fire again every second, you just want to delay the firing for a second (unless the user releases)
[04:58:47] <johnline> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/data/greetings2013/
[04:58:50] <johnline> the aim^
[04:59:08] <fabioportieri> seutje: ah, then i guess my usecase is just different...
[04:59:15] <johnline> now i need to find a way to get the 10sec video to loop seamlessly without the jamming
[04:59:24] <fabioportieri> i want it to fire every sec
[04:59:28] <seutje> fabioportieri: this is for detecing when the using long-clicks something
[04:59:43] <fabioportieri> i've implemented a spinner for icefaces
[05:00:02] <seutje> fabioportieri: well, then you probably still want to use a setTimeout that triggers itself when done
[05:00:48] <seutje> fabioportieri: just have myFunction end with the setTimeout(myFunction, 1000) call
[05:01:14] <fabioportieri> i had to wrap it inside an anonymous to get rid of annoying firefox setTimeout issue
[05:01:22] <fabioportieri> but working smoothly
[05:01:25] <fabioportieri> afaik
[05:02:13] <seutje> well yeah, ur gonna want a scope closure, but I don't see how it being a global could screw up FF though
[05:02:42] <fabioportieri> seutje: it's a firefox bug: useless setTimeout call (missing quotes around argument?)
[05:03:52] <fabioportieri> using setTimeout for key listeners and setInterval for mouse holding
[05:04:57] <seutje> ╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[05:06:12] <jop008> I use         chtml += "<table id='maintable' data-role='table' data-mode='columntoggle'>"; try to make my site responsive but no column toggle on my table
[05:06:32] <jop008> read this http://api.jquerymobile.com/table-columntoggle/
[05:09:40] <kpl> Trying to replace "live" with "on" in jquery.dataTables.editable.js version 2.3.3. I have $(".table-action-deletelink", oTable).live("click", _fnOnRowDeleteInline); Do I need to replace this with one "on" for ".table-action-deletelink" and one for oTable?
[05:10:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you up?
[05:10:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you there?
[05:10:31] <Velveeta> yeah, but literally about to be out the door, gotta take the kiddo to school
[05:11:25] <kpl> jQ docs say: $( "a.offsite" ).live( "click", function() {    to be replaced with   $( document ).on( "click", "a.offsite", function() {
[05:11:32] <Velveeta> i'll be back in about an hour
[05:12:07] <kpl> How do I apply that when converting    $(".table-action-deletelink", oTable).live("click", _fnOnRowDeleteInline);
[05:13:34] <kpl> More specifically, how do I convert    ".table-action-deletelink", oTable    to a 2nd param for     $( document ).on(    ?
[05:18:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay Velveeta
[05:19:29] <ghostlines> I used z-index 9999 but my div isn't able to cover the javacsript animation/game on my page, how can i work around this?
[05:20:24] <jop008> How to show this code at full screen?
[05:20:36] <jop008> without the jsfiddle stuf
[05:20:37] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/78/
[05:21:49] <jop008> If I inject this html inside the DOM I miss the responsive colum trigger
[05:22:08] <jop008> inject by javascript
[05:22:16] <jop008> in the fiddle the code looks fine
[05:25:06] <shoky> kpl: that's not a proper use of .live really ..
[05:28:07] <Cork> kpl: you can't
[05:28:22] <Cork> kpl: the old code works cause jquery stored the selector from oTable internally
[05:28:53] <Cork> so it basically did [".table-action-deletelink", oTable.selector].join(', ')
[05:29:05] <Cork> kpl: no sorry
[05:29:10] <Cork> * [".table-action-deletelink", oTable.selector].join(' ')
[05:29:44] <Cork> kpl: so it is a good example where live's syntax was broken, cause it didn't do what you think it did
[05:30:19] <Cork> kpl: something you might find to work is $(oTable).on('click', ".table-action-deletelink")
[05:31:39] <kpl> So I can't do this transformation:    $(".table-action-deletelink", oTable).live("click", _fnOnRowDeleteInline);     to     $(document).on("click", oTable.find(".table-action-deletelink"),_fnOnRowDeleteInline);    ?
[05:31:50] <shoky> no
[05:31:55] <Cork> no
[05:31:59] <shoky> oTable.find(".table-action-deletelink")   is not a selector
[05:32:10] <Cork> it's a result
[05:32:25] <tdammers> quick question here: the error() callback for $.ajax() isn't called for JSONP requests - how can I capture errors instead?
[05:34:01] <Cork> tdammers: i don't think error is an event for script tags
[05:34:12] <tdammers> indeed
[05:34:19] <tdammers> but the GET request *can* fail
[05:34:29] <tdammers> is there any way to capture that?
[05:34:45] <tdammers> (e.g. when the target server is down)
[05:35:04] <Cork> hmm
[05:35:09] <Cork> looks like error should work
[05:35:19] <tdammers> the docs explicitly say that it won't
[05:35:21] <Cork> scripts do have an onerror callback
[05:35:32] <jop008> I have a table see http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/78/ when clicking a row user moves to the detail page of the house. When I toggle the column modes the navigation already started
[05:35:51] <jop008> I have now a click event attached to the row
[05:35:59] <Cork> tdammers: might be some browsers doesn't support onerrror
[05:36:01] <jop008> better ways to do this?
[05:36:05] <tdammers> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:36:29] <tdammers> says: "This handler is not called for cross-domain script and cross-domain JSONP requests."
[05:36:35] <tdammers> (in the section about error)
[05:37:21] <tdammers> ah wait
[05:37:28] <tdammers> maybe I can hook into the complete() callback
[05:37:56] <shoky> i doubt it'd help you if error doesn't fire
[05:38:13] <tdammers> worth a try
[05:38:16] <shoky> you can set a timeout tho
[05:39:40] <Cork> tdammers: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/sV9kc/
[05:40:03] <Cork> so not sure what that line is about
[05:40:04] <limpc> how do you save a rotated image's info in jquery?
[05:40:11] <limpc> im making a mood board (not using canvas)
[05:40:50] <Cork> limpc: jquery doesn't have any canvas helpers natively
[05:41:09] <shoky> Cork: doesn't work with jq1.9 it seems
[05:41:10] <Cork> limpc: you would have to either load a plugin for it or run native js+dom for it
[05:41:22] * Cork nods
[05:41:42] <Cork> so prob an ie restriction
[05:41:51] <tdammers> I'm not using IE
[05:41:51] <tdammers> :D
[05:42:00] <Cork> and actually i have a vague memory of hitting just that
[05:42:03] <kpl> Another one: var oActionFormLink = $(".table-action-" + sAction);   oActionFormLink.live("click", function () {
[05:42:14] <Cork> i think it was in ie7, a failing script tag didn't trigger error
[05:42:30] <tdammers> anyway, this is for a mobile app, so I don't think I have to worry about IE7
[05:42:45] <Cork> kpl: $(document).on('click', ".table-action-" + sAction, func)
[05:43:16] <Cork> tdammers: jq 2.0 ftw! :)
[05:43:57] <tdammers> heh
[05:44:14] <kpl> Cork: thanks
[05:44:37] <tdammers> lemme try that
[05:44:46] <Cork> tdammers: this is actually the first benefit i've ever seen of 2.0+
[05:45:13] <limpc> Cork: hmm we already spent a ton of time building this thing - are you saying ill have to scrap it and redo it all using a canvas library like fabric.js?
[05:45:36] <Cork> limpc: not really
[05:45:53] <tdammers> heh, 2.0.3 works flawlessly
[05:45:53] <Cork> limpc: just that jquery is for dom manipulation, not canvas
[05:46:27] <Cork> limpc: nothing prevents you to grab the canvas and run the native code to get a data uri or blob from the browser
[05:46:44] <Cork> ?g canvas generate data uri
[05:46:44] <b-ot> Cork: Drawing an image from a data URL to a canvas - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4773966/drawing-an-image-from-a-data-url-to-a-canvas
[05:46:53] <Cork> hmm backwards :/
[05:46:55] <limpc> Cork: yeah but we're not using canvas at all for the board. just divs
[05:47:07] <Cork> uh
[05:47:36] <Cork> limpc: so you depend on css3 transform?
[05:47:41] <limpc> yeah
[05:47:41] <tdammers> thanks
[05:47:56] <Cork> limpc: then just store the transform value and your done
[05:48:09] <Cork> i could have sworn you said you used canvas
[05:48:22] <seutje> aha, who's tweaking now eh?
[05:48:26] <jop008> I want to trigger a click event when clicking a cell within a table like this $("#vwlist td").click(function() {     alert("You clicked my <td>!" + $(this).html() +            "My TR is:" + $(this).parent("tr").html());
[05:48:32] <Cork> UGG...
[05:48:37] <seutje> (had to wait for this for a pretty damn long time)
[05:48:39] <jop008> it gave me no alert
[05:48:39] <Cork> "(not using canvas)" >_<
[05:48:44] <Cork> i need to READ....
[05:48:53] <jop008> vwlist is table ID
[05:48:54] <seutje> lies, you don't need to read on the web
[05:48:58] <seutje> just look at the cats
[05:49:22] <seutje> jop008: alert isn't very good at displaying multi line content
[05:49:34] <limpc> hmm ok ill try that thanks
[05:49:35] <jop008> console.log I try
[05:49:43] <seutje> oh, didn't even get an alert, I see
[05:49:47] <jop008> I use alert many times on my site
[05:49:57] <jop008> I have redefined alert
[05:50:07] <seutje> jop008: is the table and targetted cell in the page when this runs?
[05:50:10] <limpc> Cork: yea i said (not using canvas) ;)
[05:50:37] <jop008> yes
[05:50:41] <jop008> it is
[05:50:45] <Cork> limpc: ya, i missread, sorry about that
[05:50:51] <jop008> table id = vwlist
[05:51:23] <jop008> I change it from click row to cell click
[05:51:36] <jop008> to be more precise in actiong
[05:52:11] <seutje> jop008: can't rly think of another reason it wouldn't work
[05:52:22] <shoky> jop008: stop asking questions like this without giving demos.  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ea2FL/
[05:52:45] <seutje> shoky: heh, I did the exact same thing
[05:52:49] <jop008> demo is here http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/78/
[05:52:55] <seutje> xcept I didn't even bother to properly space out and indent my table :P
[05:53:43] <ShortWave> Anyone having major Godaddy-related issues today?
[05:53:52] <seutje> jop008: this id is different
[05:53:52] <shoky> jop008 that's not a demo. it works fine
[05:54:01] <seutje> and there's no javascript bit
[05:54:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> jop008: i love the fact that that fiddle went through 78 revisions
[05:54:26] <jop008> demo works
[05:54:42] <seutje> oh, it's no supposed to do anything then?
[05:55:10] <seutje> this feels like double jeopardy or something
[05:56:52] <seutje> ur using a single fiddle to make all demos, ever... aren't you?
[05:57:03] <seutje> that's how it got to 78
[05:57:19] <seutje> so much for the purpose of revisions!
[05:57:30] <Cork> seutje: i've seen fiddles with 200+ revisions
[05:57:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey anyone know how to disable dinput using css
[05:58:02] <shoky> display:none
[05:58:30] <Cork> seutje: ex. http://jsfiddle.net/FqqhY/261/
[05:59:00] <Cork> seutje: not to forget this one http://jsfiddle.net/abkNM/1577/ :D
[05:59:11] <seutje> Cork: but in this case, revision 60 is still relevant to 260
[05:59:38] <seutje> compare http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/78/ and http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/38/ real quick
[05:59:45] <seutje> or any other revision on that id
[06:00:09] <Cork> seutje: i just meant i've seen really high numbers
[06:00:21] <shoky> well they've both got some shared includes
[06:00:21] <Cork> this are all from my history ^^
[06:01:22] <seutje> the high numbers don't surprise me (although 1577 is quite extreme), it's how they are completely not relevant to eachother
[06:01:24] <FrankDWork> can i stream stuff in from an ajax request on-the-fly with jquery? ie to tail a log
[06:01:45] <FrankDWork> if so, anyone got a good link? :D
[06:02:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: i still need it to be visible just disabled
[06:02:54] <Cork> FrankDWork: it is more a limitation of browsers
[06:02:58] <seutje> don't think you can do real streaming without websockets
[06:03:33] <seutje> xcept maybe like an awkward iframe technique, but then you'd still need to stream predefined blocks
[06:03:41] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui: css is for styling. disable with js
[06:03:43] <seutje> so it wouldn't really be streaming
[06:03:47] <Cork> FrankDWork: i would recommend checking out websocket instead
[06:03:49] <FrankDWork> hmm can i do a poll every X ms?
[06:04:05] <Cork> FrankDWork: just set a timer in complete and start a new one
[06:04:13] <seutje> sure, just have the success handler re-initiate
[06:04:18] <seutje> or complete, prolly better
[06:04:41] <Cork> well websocket is even better
[06:04:46] <Cork> then you can push the data instead
[06:04:54] <FrankDWork> i do like push!
[06:04:55] <FrankDWork> heh
[06:04:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: reason i ask cause on buttons and links that look like buttons
[06:04:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> pointer-events: none;
[06:04:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> works
[06:05:09] <seutje> I really wanna use websockets in an actual project
[06:05:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that works on inputs too
[06:05:18] <Cork> seutje: i do :)
[06:05:21] <Cork> two actually
[06:05:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> only issue is if i am pressing tab to cycle through inputs
[06:05:27] <seutje> bastard
[06:05:29] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui: not on IE10 btw
[06:05:29] <Cork> well three counting the backend
[06:05:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can type in it
[06:05:32] <seutje> hiring? :P
[06:05:32] <jop008> when I have this   $("#maintable td").click(function() {  and insert the html code the event is not triggered
[06:05:40] <Cork> :)
[06:05:48] <jop008> must I bind something first?
[06:05:51] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui: disable with js
[06:05:53] <Cork> sse is quite silly though
[06:05:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky:  i hate my life :(
[06:06:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: fuck so there is no way to avoid?
[06:06:09] <shoky> to avoid what?
[06:06:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> using js
[06:06:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wanted to do in pure css and html
[06:06:24] <seutje> jop008: that's exactly why I asked you if the call was in the page when that code was being executed
[06:06:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> as much as possible
[06:06:38] <shoky> there is no reason to avoid. js is for making changes to the DOM
[06:06:43] <seutje> jop008: look into .on(), it allows you to bind to a higher element and then filter based on a selector
[06:06:51] <shoky> js is the perfect choice for disabling an input
[06:07:02] <shoky> and the only proper choice
[06:07:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[06:07:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> see im making a front end framework thing
[06:07:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> for rapid flat design prototyping
[06:07:37] <shoky> how is this relevant
[06:07:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> and your probably asking why not just use bootstrap or the likes
[06:07:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> well the point is i wanted to minimize the use of js
[06:08:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> and really try to do as much as possible in css
[06:08:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats why its relevent
[06:08:17] <shoky> that's a stupid principle to stick by blindly
[06:08:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess :/
[06:08:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways thanks for your help :)
[06:09:01] <shoky> np;]
[06:11:46] <shoky> how did you plan to do it with css..? even if there was a  "disabled: true"  css property
[06:11:54] <shoky> you'd still need to apply it
[06:12:31] <jop008> The code is injected with append
[06:16:25] <pedda> hi there
[06:18:52] <Aquaword> anyone know a good Mega-menu plugin ?
[06:21:55] <seutje> Aquaword: $('.top-level-menu-item').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).parent().toggleClass('expanded'); }); rest is CSS, and barely any
[06:22:30] <seutje> basically just ul > li > ul { display: none; position: absolute; } ul > li.active > ul { display: block; }
[06:22:55] <seutje> make that li.expanded
[06:23:02] <seutje> changed my mind in between those lines :P
[06:23:17] <ShortWave> Anyone here experiencing major godaddy issues today?
[06:23:45] <Cork> ShortWave: not sure why you think this would be a good channel to ask in
[06:24:26] <Aquaword> seutje : sure but no time to do it from scratch
[06:25:13] <seutje> but plenty of time to waste looking for a plugin that won't even cover the entire implementation... classic
[06:26:15] <ghostlines> so in javascript you can assign a function to a variable which get's executed at the same time?
[06:26:31] <ghostlines> this is has me a bit confused because 'normally' I think after you assign a function to a var you have to explicitly call it to execute it
[06:26:34] <Cork> ghostlines: sure
[06:26:49] <seutje> don't u always have to explicitly call it?
[06:26:50] <Cork> var a; (a = function() {})();
[06:27:12] <jop008> When I toggle columns strange column headers do appear is the html okay? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/80/
[06:27:28] <seutje> oh, that doesn't count as explicit?
[06:27:44] <Cork> well you assign and run it at the same time :)
[06:27:52] <Cork> never said it wasn't explicit ^^'
[06:27:54] <shoky> iife. immediately != at the same time
[06:27:59] <jop008> I thought you can hide and show columns with the filter
[06:28:12] <jop008> but the behaviour is diffferent
[06:28:34] <Cork> shoky: cleanest is most likely to first create it and then run it
[06:28:56] <ghostlines> but that's hardly ever done I think
[06:29:13] <shoky> mm was that meant to be directed at me?
[06:29:24] <Cork> well yes and no ^^'
[06:29:27] <Cork> both
[06:29:55] <Radditz> hello
[06:30:00] <Radditz> how can I add an element in jquery and have an id for it
[06:30:06] <shoky> well. you can't run it before creating, no? or i'm just tired
[06:30:35] <Cork> Radditz: two ways, parse html, or create the dom element and give it an id
[06:30:36] <seutje> jop008: THs aren't in a thead
[06:30:52] <Radditz> Cork: which one is the recommended one?
[06:30:57] <jop008> thx
[06:31:07] <Cork> Radditz: depends on the complexity of where you need it
[06:31:18] <Cork> var newElm = $('<div id="a"></div>')
[06:31:22] <Radditz> I just need to add a div with an id and maybe a paragraph
[06:31:27] <seutje> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/81/
[06:31:34] <Cork> var newElm = $('<div>').attr('id', 'a');
[06:31:37] <Radditz> how can I add it to an already existing div?
[06:31:46] <Cork> attr
[06:32:03] <Radditz> I mean add a newly crated element to an existing element in the page

[06:44:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys
[06:44:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> will you entertain a github question
[06:44:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i type: git branches
[06:44:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mean git branch
[06:44:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> i get 2 branches

[06:51:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> *intense
[06:51:10] <Cork> and ppl getting mad cause noone answers
[06:51:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[06:51:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[06:51:57] <Radditz> what is the difference between add and append?
[06:52:03] <Cork> and how are ppl new to irc going to understand that if noone tells them
[06:52:18] <Cork> Radditz: add just generates a new jquery result array
[06:52:24] <Cork> it doens't modify the dom in anyway
[06:52:54] <Radditz> I see, thank you
[06:53:05] <Cork> [result1, result2].add([result3]) == [result1, result2, result3]
[06:53:45] <Cork> note unlike push, add doesn't modify the original variable
[06:54:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork valid point. oh the conclusion to my github problems: i am abandoning their windows client, so much easier to use the git hub shell
[06:54:49] <Cork> git hub shell?
[06:55:01] <Cork> they actually have there own shell?
[06:55:05] <Cork> though they just used git
[06:55:50] <koneko> Cork, it's bundled as GitHub Shell but it uses regular git and usually PowerShell
[06:56:12] <koneko> It just configures the SSH keys and all without any work from your side from what I know
[06:56:18] <Cork> iih..
[06:56:41] <Cork> well guess it is needed if you don't have a real shell :P
[06:58:00] <koneko> Or if you like to click on octocats instead of a blue box
[06:58:34] <koneko> PowerShell itself isn't that bad though, had a guy at uni that refused to use nix shells and could do magic in PowerShell
[06:58:59] <airdem> how do i get the portion of .outerHeight() that is visible in a scrollable element?
[07:05:20] <kpl> More live -> on conversions needed, in dataTables-1.9.4 extras TableTools: $('tr', dt.nTBody).live( 'click', function(e) {    where  dt = this.s.dt      again dt.n.TBody   is not a selector?  so I could try just this as a selector?
[07:08:06] <limpc> when using css3 transforms to rotate a div, will it also rotate the image inside?
[07:08:10] <kpl> $(dt.nTBody).on('click', 'tr', function (e) {   does not give an error    does that mean it is a selector?
[07:10:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: i think they jsut call it github shell
[07:10:17] <kpl> In firebug dt is Object { oFeatures={...}, oScroll={...}, oLanguage={...}, more...}
[07:10:37] <kpl> dt.nTBody is <tbody role="alert" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="all">
[07:10:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: apparently it comes preinstalled with windows version of github
[07:12:48] <kpl> Someone: How do you define a "selector" and a "result", and how do I distinguish between them in firebug?
[07:14:09] <kpl> Is the result the group of elements you get from a selector?
[07:15:20] <raj> on page load, I am binding a clickhandler to the parent, delegated to the child. After an ajax call, I am also binding a click event on the parent, delegated to the child. Somehow, the binding in the ajax callback fires first! Isn't it supposed to fire in the order it was bound??
[07:15:27] <fabioportieri> i have two events on the same element: one is a click event and the other is a "holding mousebutton" event.. how can i prevent race condition between the two, i.e. if click is triggered then holding should not fire and viceversa
[07:17:22] <fabioportieri> i guess unbound the other event as soon as the other starts and then rebound?
[07:18:07] <raj> kpl, I'm not sure what you mean?
[07:18:54] <fabioportieri> raj i've implemented a spinner, the user can click on the arrow and increment by one, or can keep holding the arrow and keep incrementing
[07:19:23] <fabioportieri> two distinct events, problem is, when user clicks both events are triggered so the user increments by 2 instead of by 1
[07:19:44] <fabioportieri> just noticed you weren't talking to me
[07:20:00] <ae-r> use mousedown instead of click?
[07:20:20] <fabioportieri> ah.. merge into one
[07:20:23] <raj> fabioportieri, so do mousedown
[07:20:32] <raj> with setTimeout
[07:21:28] <fabioportieri> at first i only had mousedown not sure why i had to add onclick.. brb and thanks
[07:23:14] <kpl> $("div")   refers to an array of div elements, which is an array of Object ?
[07:23:36] <raj> yes
[07:24:02] <raj> could be none, or 1, or many objects in that array
[07:24:17] <raj> depending on how many 'div's it picks up
[07:25:27] <kpl> and   $(this)   vs   $("this"):    in the former the selector is "", in the latter the selector is "this"
[07:25:51] <raj> 'this' is not a selector
[07:25:56] <raj> I mean "this" is not a selector
[07:26:15] <raj> (single-quote or double-quote may be used, btw)
[07:26:30] <raj> because `this` is not an html tag
[07:26:33] <kpl> I think in $("this")  then this is regarded as a selector
[07:26:39] <raj> ".this" could be a class
[07:26:45] <raj> "#this" could be an ID
[07:27:02] <raj> $("this") is an invalid selector
[07:27:22] <kpl> OK, and the result is?
[07:27:24] <sacho> kpl, a selector is always a string using the css notation to designate elements.
[07:27:37] <sacho> kpl, the result of calling jQuery with a selector is a jQuery collection
[07:27:43] <raj> are you familiar with css selectors?
[07:27:52] <kpl> yes
[07:28:04] <raj> ok, so you know `this` isnot a valid css selector?
[07:29:03] <kpl> If you pass an invalid selector (e.g. a tag name which does not exist), you get an empty collection?
[07:29:09] <sacho> yes.
[07:29:26] <sacho> you can also pass a dom element to the jQuery function, which results in a jQuery collection wrapping that element.
[07:29:35] <raj> you can check out http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ for a complete list of selectors
[07:29:38] <sacho> which is what the effect of $(this) is, if `this` is a dom element
[07:29:48] <kpl> Firebug seems to report that "this" is a selector when I do $("this")
[07:30:03] <kpl> but it may be an invalid one
[07:30:08] <raj> sacho, I think that would be confusing until he understands what plain string selectors are doing
[07:30:13] <sacho> yes. If you call jQuery's function with a string, then it is treated as a selector or an html string.
[07:30:32] <raj> kpl, just type `this` without any quotes
[07:30:39] <raj> and you'll see it's an element
[07:30:49] <raj> when you throw $( ) around it, it turns it into a jquery object
[07:30:56] <raj> jquery figures out how to "select" it
[07:31:24] <raj> `this` is a special variable
[07:31:24] <b-ot> raj: memorised “this`”.
[07:31:49] <kpl> What firebug reports:  Object[]      vs      Object[Object { s={...}, dom={...}, classes={...}, more...}]        for  $("this") and $(this), respectively
[07:32:11] <shoky> kpl: $("this") looks for <this> elements.
[07:33:01] <sacho> kpl, One is an empty jquery collection, and the other is a jquery collection with a single element.
[07:33:04] <andrewrota> join #gruntjs
[07:34:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> so Velveeta what have you been working on recently
[07:35:17] <Velveeta> some new button styles for our core product, and refactoring a select widget from top to bottom to add template support and some immediate feedback, pseudo-mvvm pattern, as well as porting some of that to another widget of ours that it uses internally
[07:35:43] <kpl> OK. If $("this") is empty, it makes sense that firebug says Object[], but when I click on Object[]  see a header "window > Object", and context info.
[07:36:04] <shoky> so?
[07:36:10] <Velveeta> and now i'm apparently gonna be burning a day this week to look into what i can do for a product we purchased for an enterprise service bus solution, that they want to streamline the workflow on, not to do any of the work, but just to do a deep dive into it and see what the level of effort would be for what our guys are wanting to do with it
[07:36:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> sounds like your busy busy
[07:36:47] <Velveeta> kpl: $('this') is always going to be empty, unless you have an element type in your document named 'this', like 'div' or 'p' or 'span'
[07:37:06] <kpl> I guess one useful way to explain it is to use "length" on it. Then I get 0 and 1, respectivly, for $("this").length and $(this).length, so it makes sense.
[07:37:07] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: yepyep, and they just promoted me, so i doubt it's gonna slow down anytime soon :D
[07:37:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol true
[07:37:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> man I wish i wasnt in school :(
[07:37:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> more freedom
[07:37:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> getting off after exams
[07:37:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> have 3 weeks in sunny CA
[07:37:48] <Velveeta> mo' freedom mo' responsibility
[07:39:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[07:39:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have expected a LOTR quote or soemthing
[07:39:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[07:40:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> somethign along the lines of "with great power comes great responsibility"
[07:41:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> brb
[07:42:15] <grafi> thats not LOTR
[07:42:16] <grafi> oô
[07:42:50] <Velveeta> yeah that's like spiderman or something i think
[07:42:58] <Velveeta> how about this one… "fly, you fools!"
[07:43:15] <grafi> you shall not pass
[07:43:33] <Velveeta> one day when i had bubblegut, i told my coworkers i'd be back, and followed it up with "drums…. drums in the deep"

[07:51:45] <jop008> My site has font size look nice on desktop but on mobile the size is far to big how to avoid this?
[07:54:18] <raj> on page load, I am binding a clickhandler to the parent, delegated to the child. After an ajax call, I am also binding a click event on the parent, delegated to the child. Somehow, the binding in the ajax callback fires first! Isn't it supposed to fire in the order it was bound??
[07:56:02] <raj> jop008, have a .mobile class that uses different font-size maybe?
[07:56:42] <shoky> raj donno if you can count on it being in the same order it was bound, especially for delegated events. though if you got a demo...
[07:56:59] <GabrielFiel> hello, using sortable is the a way to define 1 div inside the boz wich has items to sort, for block and cant move it?
[07:58:02] <raj> shoky, so there's no way to guarantee order of handlers?
[07:58:04] <porton> I want vertically expanding (when text is added) textarea
[07:59:22] <raj> porton, 49
[07:59:26] <raj> porton, http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/
[07:59:43] <porton> raj: what is 49?
[07:59:55] <raj> dunno
[08:00:00] <raj> pasted somehow
[08:00:50] <shoky> raj adunno. but it does work for me.. in the order it was bound
[08:08:45] <raj> shoky, you're right, I can't recreate in fiddle
[08:09:32] <shoky> sure it's all on the same elements?
[08:12:53] <raj> $('#item-list').on('click.listing.marked', '.bubble'    vs    $('#item-list').on('click', '.bubble, .submit-button',
[08:13:53] <shoky> `shrug
[08:13:54] <b-ot> shoky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:14:10] <raj> someone needs to repair that ascii art
[08:14:26] <raj> or gnu screen maybe doesn't handle it well
[08:14:35] <shoky> it's unicode
[08:15:00] <shoky> japanese tsu
[08:16:24] <airdem> do japanese ppl pronounce please as prease?
[08:16:51] <airdem> or was is the chinese?
[08:17:02] <shoky> puriizu
[08:17:26] <airdem> so they convert L to R
[08:17:30] <shoky> no
[08:17:36] <shoky> they have their own letter.
[08:17:50] <raj> lmao
[08:17:53] <shoky> which sounds somewhere in between american L and R
[08:17:58] <airdem> but what i dont understand is that they pronounce suprise as suplies
[08:18:02] <airdem> converting R to L
[08:18:04] <airdem> boggles my mind
[08:18:07] <shoky> i just explained.
[08:18:11] <raj> airdem, it's sulplies
[08:18:21] <airdem> raj, true
[08:18:26] <airdem> tlue?
[08:18:30] <raj> lmao
[08:18:43] <shoky> more like saapuraizu
[08:18:57] <airdem> because in german every R becomes L
[08:19:02] <airdem> no exceptions! :)
[08:19:12] <Velveeta> all i know is sushi is yummy
[08:19:26] <airdem> im gonna eat that tonight! it shule is!
[08:19:27] <raj> shoky's a hentai connoisseur
[08:19:32] <shoky> ;D
[08:19:33] <raj> can't compete with his japanese knowledge at this point
[08:19:45] <airdem> you need more diciprine!
[08:19:51] <airdem> dis*
[08:19:56] <shoky> airdem: ok enough
[08:20:26] <airdem> yu needo moru discupurinu, better?
[08:20:47] <raj> lol
[08:20:59] <raj> ok, back to jquery
[08:21:07] <airdem> i love how they pronounce Street Fighter 3rd Strike
[08:24:10] <raj> how can I check the order of eventhandlers in the console, without firing?
[08:26:05] <raj> so I can see when the order changes
[08:26:23] <shoky> raj you get some order with $._data(element, 'events')  but again.. donno if you can count on this for anything
[08:27:19] <raj> $._data('#item-list', 'events') is undefined
[08:27:36] <shoky> element, not selector
[08:27:50] <shoky> $._data( $('#item-list')[0], 'events' )
[08:27:54] <raj> ah
[08:31:26] <raj> thanks shoky, hopefully this'll help me debug properly
[08:31:30] <raj> what's delegateCount, btw?
[08:32:06] <jop008> any one a good set of media queries?
[08:32:21] <jop008> Now I am just trial and error
[08:32:43] <jop008> font size is the biggest issue the table is responsive
[08:33:17] <jop008> biggest issue is font size
[08:34:39] <airdem> jop008, http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ read the "It's responsive" part. no offense :)
[08:34:41] <raj> ahh, solved my issue
[08:34:44] <raj> THANKS SHOKY
[08:35:14] <shoky> raj: it's what it sounds like
[08:35:16] <raj> ...full disclosure, I was executing a certain function in a <script> tag directly as well within the html
[08:35:18] <shoky> np ;p
[08:35:46] <raj> anyway, hopefully I get this freaking thing up today
[08:35:52] <jop008> Not very helpful link
[08:35:53] <raj> i need to start studying for my other job
[08:36:00] <shoky> neato
[08:36:57] <airdem> jop008, you want responsive design? maybe take a look at http://www.getskeleton.com/
[08:37:37] <jop008> good site
[08:38:24] <Guest69115> oh ffs..
[08:41:20] <TheEternalAbyss_> ok.. so I have a question.. when dealing with setIntervals.. I have two set intervals.. actually they are nested, one inside the other. Lets call them interval1 and interval2. If I halt interval two (which is inside interval1) with clarInterval, how to I start it up again, but it picks up where it dropped off?
[08:41:36] <fabioportieri> http://programming-motherfucker.com/
[08:41:54] <TheEternalAbyss_> fabioportieri: that directed at me?
[08:42:02] <fabioportieri> TheEternalAbyss_: nop, to the channel
[08:42:12] <TheEternalAbyss_> ah
[08:42:16] <TheEternalAbyss_> that is a great site btw
[08:42:19] <jop008> wat is the media query for a desktop bwoser?
[08:42:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss_: is back yay! :)
[08:42:47] <TheEternalAbyss_> o hai Rohan_Bhangui
[08:43:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you up to now
[08:43:23] <TheEternalAbyss_> working ... what else
[08:43:27] <TheEternalAbyss_> :\
[08:44:18] <hugo_moss> jop: media queries go by the width or height of the screen, so a desktop browser can be anything from 1024 pixels to 2560 pixels in width
[08:44:27] <hugo_moss> it depends on what you want to target
[08:44:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss_: figured. ugh too lazy to work right now
[08:44:59] <TheEternalAbyss_> Rohan_Bhangui: it's all i have really, so I have no choice
[08:45:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol but even then you must have some time to just program for fun! :P
[08:46:02] <TheEternalAbyss_> not really... all the plans I had went down the drain
[08:46:44] <fosser_josh> var fruit = ["apple","orange","banana"]; how to display this list in <div> using jquery?
[08:47:08] <airdem> fosser use a loop
[08:47:33] <fosser_josh> .each()?
[08:47:47] <airdem> fruit is a javascript array, use a js loop
[08:47:57] <TheEternalAbyss_> fosser_josh: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1198436/foreach-equivalent-of-php-in-jquery#1198439

[08:49:29] <mathi> hi
[08:49:35] <mathi> i think i found a buig in jquery
[08:49:38] <mathi> *bug
[08:49:51] <airdem> you want a medal or smth?
[08:50:15] <TheEternalAbyss_> lol
[08:50:17] <mathi> airdem, no i was going to explain the problem :p
[08:50:25] <TheEternalAbyss_> mathi: do tell
[08:50:30] <mathi> but well if nobody cares
[08:50:32] <mathi> ok
[08:50:33] <airdem> mathi, im just kidding. can you recreate it in jsfiddlem aybe?
[08:50:45] <TheEternalAbyss_> in the meantime, no ideas about my setInterval query?
[08:51:24] <mathi> yes, it's here:  http://jsfiddle.net/kMD6U/      focus one of the div elements, wait a fex seconds, and you see that filter() and is() results are different for firefox and chrome
[08:51:40] <mathi> I try to check if any of the .text-block elements has the focus
[08:51:53] <TheEternalAbyss_> that may be a browser problem more than a jquery one
[08:51:56] <mathi> and I see that the results are not consistent
[08:52:02] <airdem> mathi,  getting false 0 0 1 on firefox
[08:52:05] <airdem> have no chrome
[08:52:13] <mathi> airdem, chrome is true 0 1 1
[08:53:00] <mathi> look the problem is that, only the last way works : $('someSelector:focus') but if you have your elements in a variable you can't do it that way
[08:55:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss_: i found the solution to any bug problem.
[08:56:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> stop using that browser
[08:56:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[08:56:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD
[08:56:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh man im bored
[08:56:18] <airdem> mathi, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2683742/is-there-a-has-focus-in-javascript-or-jquery
[08:56:22] <airdem> maybe helpful
[08:57:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: does jquery not ahve like a .on("focus"
[08:57:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> *have
[08:57:38] <FrankDWork> anyone have a jQuery/AJAX/PHP/MySQL pagination example?
[08:58:06] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, mathi seem like jQ has :focus since 1.6 http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[08:59:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> FrankDWork: why all 4
[08:59:21] <mathi> airdem, well yeah, that's what i used in the jsfiddle :p
[08:59:40] <FrankDWork> Rohan_Bhangui, -- is there a better way to paginate results from a  MySQL table?
[09:00:49] <FrankDWork> I'm not really a web guy, I thought those might be the best tools for the job, but please do correct me if I'm wrong
[09:01:18] <BillCriswell> mathi: console.log() can make things seem weird at times.
[09:01:52] <mathi> airdem, actually i can get the focused element and check if it has a class text-block (so the other way around)  :p
[09:02:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> FrankDWork:  you will only ge tthe first language pagination youll have to creat the other 3 parts yourself
[09:03:47] <BillCriswell> document.activeElement might be of interest mathi. Came across that the other day.
[09:03:51] <FrankDWork> Rohan_Bhangui, that's why I was seeing if someone had a link to an example.. constructing the query/getting the data out of SQL in PHP and formatting it how I want to be displayed in a div based on a 'page' is no problem
[09:04:19] <FrankDWork> but like I said -- not a web guy, so if someone had a basic example thatd be great
[09:04:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> well FrankDWork: well are you familiar with data retrivial from jquery via ajax to php which grabs data from mysql?
[09:04:59] <FrankDWork> Rohan_Bhangui, just as far as autocomplete :)
[09:05:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> haha
[09:05:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay ill show you how i do ajax requests
[09:05:29] <airdem> FrankDWork, already got the PHP pagination code working?
[09:05:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> FrankDWork: pagination implimentation after the ajax request is easy
[09:06:17] <FrankDWork> airdem, no I didn't really start on it yet, just got another part of it done (autocomplete and ajax form post -> php to initiate an action)
[09:07:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: why dont you take this one
[09:08:49] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, take what?
[09:09:37] <airdem> FrankDWork, in my opinion you should build the php pagination first
[09:09:45] <airdem> the rest is just simple ajax
[09:10:14] <airdem> there is even a nice plugin to use with jquery called simplepagination
[09:10:21] <FrankDWork> well the php part is simpler to me :D
[09:10:51] <airdem> http://flaviusmatis.github.io/simplePagination.js/
[09:11:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: was just gonna suggest that one and when i said take this one meaning help FrankDWork out
[09:12:07] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, got it. thank  you :)
[09:12:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol np
[09:14:15] <Zee4Q> is jquery about more than just mindblowingly-cool lightboxes and sliders?
[09:15:23] <airdem> FrankDWork, somethin like this
[09:16:06] <airdem> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cb89e2f85af1f6366b57
[09:16:17] <airdem> you need to retrieve some values from your php script
[09:16:26] <airdem> like the total number of items
[09:18:43] <FrankDWork> airdem.. ok thanks I'll go take a look and play a bit
[09:24:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Zee4Q: what you mean?
[09:25:37] <Zee4Q> I mean that when I google jquery examples, probably 95% are sliders and lightboxesvery cool ones, but I'm curious what else can be done with it
[09:26:00] <bendman> I'm trying to use widget inheritance with a named function (for async reasons), but in the parent method (called via _super) "this" is Window
[09:26:14] <bendman> I've got a simplified use case here: http://jsbin.com/UPAriKo/2/edit
[09:26:28] <airdem> FrankDWork, i have to go now. good luck!
[09:28:55] <krambiorix> hi, my ajax code is returning a javascript function in a string... Is there anyway to make it executable?
[09:30:17] <grafi> hey girls
[09:30:22] <grafi> what you're doing
[09:35:58] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You can use eval() or $.getScript()
[09:36:15] <grafi> ugh
[09:36:20] <grafi> BillCriswell is the devil
[09:36:38] <BillCriswell> eval() I imagine is what $.getScript() does? I really have no clue though.
[09:36:40] <BillCriswell> I am haha.
[09:37:40] <thesisb> I don't know what the question is but you probably don't want to use eval
[09:37:46] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I'm educated enough on this topic now that I think about it.
[09:38:07] <grafi> on that note you are probably not wanting to execute code you got back from the server ...
[09:38:15] <grafi> so thats that ^^
[09:38:31] <BillCriswell> thesisb: He wants to run some code he gets from an ajax request.
[09:39:33] <thesisb> If that's the case then you need eval, however maybe the problem isn't defined correctly.  Why do you need to fetch code? why cant it be there already?
[09:39:58] <thesisb> or why cant it be a url string and you dynamically load a js file
[09:40:50] <grafi> valid questions :P
[09:41:12] <BillCriswell> Would $('head').append('<script>' + code + '</script>'); be as evil?
[09:41:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ehhhhh
[09:41:27] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui beeee
[09:41:28] <grafi> oô
[09:41:45] <BillCriswell> seeeeee
[09:41:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P i got used to using git shell
[09:41:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> well github shell
[09:42:01] <grafi> i see you are making progress creating my framework
[09:42:01] <grafi> ^^

[09:42:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> your framework? since when was it your framework ? :P
[09:42:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> well they call it github shell
[09:42:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> same shit as git shell
[09:42:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was able to update github.io page
[09:43:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> got some of the stuff really working

[09:43:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> chagned the text font to helvetica neue
[09:43:20] <thesisb> BillCriswell: id suggest doing it in vanilla js like this http://pastebin.com/VHN27vgb
[09:43:27] <grafi> the dots arent centered in ff btw ^^
[09:43:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> really?
[09:43:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmm

[09:44:08] <grafi> xD
[09:44:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> good enough XD
[09:44:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> try to fix them if you want
[09:46:10] <grafi> hm will try
[09:47:33] <grafi> whats the 1pc you have for lineheight oô
[09:48:15] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui ^
[09:48:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats for vetical positioning
[09:48:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> i jsut changed that to 17p
[09:48:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> *17px
[09:48:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> did it get fixed grafi
[09:49:07] <grafi> but what pc
[09:49:07] <grafi> oô
[09:49:11] <grafi> *whats
[09:49:21] <grafi> never seen that as a unit
[09:49:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> picas i think
[09:50:02] <grafi> hm
[09:50:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp
[09:50:14] <grafi> setting line-height equal to height fixes it for me
[09:50:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi:  ^
[09:50:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky push those changes
[09:50:30] <grafi> dont quote w3schools for the love of fuck ^^
[09:50:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry
[09:50:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> forgot
[09:50:39] <grafi> :P
[09:50:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[09:50:46] <grafi> i thought you already changed it :o
[09:50:52] <grafi> xD
[09:51:00] <Velveeta> lol
[09:51:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i hcanged line-height to 17px
[09:51:23] <grafi> cool stuff ^^
[09:51:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it fine now?
[09:51:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[09:51:53] <grafi> erm
[09:51:54] <grafi> no
[09:51:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck
[09:52:00] <grafi> because the height is 15px
[09:52:02] <grafi> not 17
[09:52:03] <grafi> ^^
[09:52:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ugh
[09:52:09] <grafi> naaap
[09:52:09] <grafi> :P
[09:52:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> if its 15 then it doesnt look right for me
[09:52:20] <grafi> we should really convert that to sass soon :p
[09:52:24] <grafi> in chrome?
[09:52:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[09:52:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think chrome is jumbled a bit
[09:53:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause at 15px height
[09:53:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> and 15px line hieght it is exactly centered when i zoom
[09:53:39] <grafi> when i change it in chrome it looks fine to me
[09:53:44] <grafi> to 15px that is
[09:53:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:53:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> what resolution
[09:53:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> im sitting at 1920*1080
[09:54:36] <grafi> dito
[09:55:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> still looking funny for me
[09:55:15] <BillCriswell> thesisb: It's code though, not a URL string, which had me question it... plus using vanilla js when jQuery is loaded feels like a crime to me haha
[09:55:21] <grafi> hm
[09:55:24] <BillCriswell> Mostly cause I'm lazy.
[09:55:24] <grafi> no idea :P
[09:55:53] <grafi> BillCriswell jQuery evangelist ^^
[09:56:24] <BillCriswell> Any of you "Map to Network Resource" in Chrome?
[09:56:42] <thesisb> The fact that it is code is what made me say maybe the problem wasn't defined properly.... currently youre describing something like  "on clicking this, ask backend what to do, get code, run it. " There is bad architecture in that
[09:57:09] <thesisb> I know jQuery is being used but for script loading you want it to be fast, effecient, and that's how requirejs does it I think :P
[09:57:20] <BillCriswell> thesisb: I agree. I wouldn't find myself in that situation. someone else asked.
[09:58:05] <BillCriswell> I have to touch the "Developers Tools" window to get the styles to refresh. It's making me sad. =(
[09:58:07] <grafi> BillCriswell no, but it looks sexy as hell
[09:58:09] <grafi> :P
[09:58:21] <grafi> really oo^
[09:58:24] <grafi> hm
[09:58:34] <grafi> thats not what paul irish promised me ^^
[09:58:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: try font size 32px
[09:58:49] <grafi> what the fuck?
[09:59:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> and line hieght 15px;
[09:59:12] <grafi> i feel like that should be more flexible ^^
[09:59:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> ????
[09:59:28] <BillCriswell> grafi: It is awesome, no doubt about it. It's svaing me tons of time, but that one hiccup is pretty bothersome. Worth it, though.
[09:59:36] <grafi> if it only looks right with a certain font size?
[09:59:54] <grafi> still sounds more annoying than manually refreshing xD
[10:00:19] <BillCriswell> Quick Alt + Tab, Alt + Tab is better than waiting for a refresh.
[10:00:28] <grafi> meh
[10:00:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol grafi just try it
[10:00:33] <grafi> im not in a hurry
[10:00:34] <grafi> :P
[10:00:51] <BillCriswell> Either am I, but I hate when things are slow.
[10:00:55] <grafi> no time now, have to watch football :P
[10:01:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh come on grafi
[10:01:13] <grafi> no shit, it just started
[10:01:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay can you atleast test the font size changes
[10:01:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> i psuh ed to the repo
[10:03:43] <grafi> are the pages already up to date for you?
[10:03:57] <grafi> i dont really see a difference in font-size
[10:03:57] <grafi> :o
[10:05:56] <grafi> oh now
[10:05:57] <grafi> hm
[10:06:02] <grafi> looks good
[10:06:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold updating
[10:09:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: should be fixed although the size is looking odd to me
[10:10:25] <grafi> looks like its 1px off to me ^^
[10:10:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay tell you what im rolling out the big guns
[10:10:50] <grafi> :D
[10:10:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> im gonna whip up my own icon font
[10:10:56] <grafi> lol
[10:11:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: http://icomoon.io/app
[10:11:18] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong? the alert is never invoked:   http://jsfiddle.net/ge4Af/
[10:11:20] <grafi> way to making it easy to set up xD
[10:12:04] <grafi> krambiorix why are there random dots inside the source oô
[10:12:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[10:12:21] <grafi> krambiorix also you dont have jquery inlcuded
[10:12:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> i had actually figured out how to do it on native raido ubttons
[10:12:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> but decided against
[10:12:39] <grafi> and no #checktype
[10:12:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause then only support on ie side for ie11
[10:13:08] <grafi> how far back did we want to support ie again?
[10:13:11] <krambiorix> grafi the random dots show that there is code below
[10:13:37] <grafi> so its a shitty example of code that obviously cant work?
[10:13:38] <grafi> ok
[10:13:47] <krambiorix> grafi, i just want to show my code not test it
[10:14:02] <grafi> ok i've seen your code
[10:14:06] <grafi> be happy

[10:15:47] <Alina-malina> grafi, i found this in code? what the hell this suppose to mean?
[10:15:56] <grafi> [19:15:17] <grafi> remove the class from the siblings add the class to the selected element Alina-malina
[10:16:00] <grafi> whats unclear?
[10:16:22] <Alina-malina> grafi, i say i found this in one websites code, what is this?
[10:16:24] <krambiorix> where is BillCriswell when you need 'm
[10:16:47] <Alina-malina> ok nvm
[10:16:53] <grafi> Alina-malina ok ;)
[10:16:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi:  up to ie10 would be nice
[10:17:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> even ie9 for that matter
[10:17:11] <grafi> so back to
[10:17:18] <grafi> ie9 i can agree with :P
[10:17:29] <krambiorix> anyone?
[10:17:34] <grafi> although i have no way to test that
[10:17:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i think im gonna take this enxt level
[10:18:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> svg
[10:18:24] <grafi> can ie9 do svg oô
[10:18:28] <Adil> hi
[10:18:40] <grafi> furthermore, doesnt that complicate the markup?
[10:18:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes it does
[10:18:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> im triyng icon font
[10:19:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> its not antialiasing properly
[10:19:09] <grafi> i dont like that very much either ^^
[10:19:15] <Adil> Can anybody tell me any source to learn jquery with respect to asp.net
[10:19:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mgiht as well do bitmap image grafi

[10:21:08] <grafi> exactly
[10:21:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: in my files i have i think 4 sets of ways we could have solved the radio button
[10:21:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1st one is out
[10:21:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> only uspport n ie11
[10:21:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the rest are half working
[10:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> the last one
[10:22:06] <grafi> whats the 1st?
[10:22:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> has all the required selectors
[10:22:07] <grafi> oô
[10:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> it just doesnt center properly

[10:44:29] <otiuk> I am getting the error:  Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined nu_tssurvey.js:1 (anonymous function) -- so i think i am having loading issues.. if you could check it out at:  http://empirezero.net/test -- and let me know what the best way would be have all that load that'd be great
[10:44:38] <nettoweb> is there a way to overlay the background when open a bootstrap popover?
[10:45:04] <grafi> i dont think thats possible out of the box TheEternalAbyss
[10:45:20] <Alina-malina> I still need a normal javascript functions viewer, please suggest me somthing
[10:45:37] <TheEternalAbyss> ugh... a progress bar should not be this complcated..
[10:45:45] <_rgn> Alina-malina: what's a normal javascript functions viewer?
[10:45:52] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[10:45:54] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss make it easier then :P
[10:46:04] <Bloomberg> I'm working with scrollabletab class
[10:46:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: fake it  :P
[10:46:09] <Bloomberg> Bu I have a problem
[10:46:18] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina what do you mean "a normal javascript functions viewer"?
[10:46:19] <Alina-malina> i want to see what steps making page, step by step, so i can pause and see
[10:46:34] <TheEternalAbyss> Alina-malina: don't we all
[10:46:41] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina what browser do you normally use?
[10:46:47] <Alina-malina> ff
[10:46:47] <TheEternalAbyss> doesn't really exist unless you look at dev tools
[10:46:51] <grafi> Alina-malina learn to use debugging in your devtools=
[10:46:53] <duch_kazatel> Firebug.
[10:46:54] <TheEternalAbyss> but that's not going to give you step by step
[10:47:04] <Alina-malina> i have all of them, but non of them helped me in this task
[10:47:05] <duch_kazatel> or firefox's built-in dev tools
[10:47:17] <TheEternalAbyss> yea you can set breakpoints I think
[10:47:24] <duch_kazatel> the script panel with a breakpoint in FireBug does exactly that.
[10:47:41] <duch_kazatel> with options to step in, step over, and step out, line by line.
[10:47:47] <Alina-malina> it says no javascript on this page
[10:47:52] <duch_kazatel> even IE11 has a built-in option.
[10:48:00] <grafi> stop with ie11 already
[10:48:11] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[10:48:22] <Alina-malina> lol?
[10:48:32] <TheEternalAbyss> lol = laughs out loud
[10:48:42] <TheEternalAbyss> you new to irc?
[10:48:47] <Alina-malina> i know what is lol, it sais No Javascript on this page
[10:48:51] <Alina-malina> *says
[10:48:55] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina what tab?
[10:49:02] <Alina-malina> Script
[10:49:04] <TheEternalAbyss> that means your js isn't loading
[10:49:13] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, you have no scripts.
[10:49:29] <duch_kazatel> are your script tags pointing to the right sources?
[10:49:45] <Alina-malina> scripts are included
[10:49:51] <Alina-malina> not on that page
[10:49:52] <Alina-malina> loool
[10:49:57] <TheEternalAbyss> or you have a syntax error preventing any code from loading
[10:50:13] <TheEternalAbyss> ah well there's your problem theb
[10:50:14] <TheEternalAbyss> then
[10:50:15] <Alina-malina> there is no javascript on that page, all scripts are included
[10:50:27] <duch_kazatel> what
[10:50:28] <Alina-malina> firebug not going to wkr?
[10:50:28] <TheEternalAbyss> make sure the includes are correct
[10:50:35] <duch_kazatel> you need to have javascript on the page.
[10:50:43] <duch_kazatel> "there is no javascript on that page, all scripts are included"
[10:50:48] <duch_kazatel> that sentence hardly makes sense
[10:50:50] <duch_kazatel> which is it?
[10:51:09] <Alina-malina> they are loadd as follwing <script src="></script>
[10:51:10] <Alina-malina> it is not my code
[10:51:29] <TheEternalAbyss> ...
[10:51:35] <grafi> Alina-malina go to the scripts tab, below the menu stuff there should be "inline" somewhere to the left side, click on it, itll show you all the scripts included
[10:51:38] <TheEternalAbyss> dude, just jsfiddle or sumthin
[10:51:48] <b3tamax> +1 for da fiddlde
[10:51:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah fiddle it.
[10:52:11] <Alina-malina> Warning: Enabling the Script panel causes a Firefox slow-down due to a platform bug. This will be fixed with the next major Firefox and Firebug versions.
[10:52:18] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:52:21] <TheEternalAbyss> yea that's fine
[10:52:22] <duch_kazatel> just enable it for now.
[10:52:30] <TheEternalAbyss> brb
[10:52:41] <Alina-malina> how to enable it hmmm?
[10:53:12] <duch_kazatel> see that little black triangle next to the title of that tab?
[10:53:14] <duch_kazatel> click that.
[10:53:23] <b3tamax> Anyone found a good to get stack traces from Firefox Dev Tools?
[10:53:39] <Alina-malina> but there is no trianble
[10:53:53] <Alina-malina> nothing clickable either
[10:54:03] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/0sqgMWm.png
[10:54:05] <duch_kazatel> you should see that.
[10:54:24] <Alina-malina> yes
[10:54:43] <Alina-malina> it is enabled
[10:54:44] <duch_kazatel> so you have the little black bit next to the word "script"?
[10:54:52] <duch_kazatel> all right - now reload the page.
[10:55:12] <Alina-malina> ok now i have the html page
[10:55:32] <Alina-malina> how to make breakpoints and see what is executing?
[10:57:09] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina you should see something like this: http://i.imgur.com/lAWaGYA.png
[10:57:38] <duch_kazatel> see the filename "jquery.nouislider.min.js"?  click that to select the file you want to put breakpoints in.
[10:57:58] <Alina-malina> just a moment i will make a screenshot of what i see now
[10:58:12] <duch_kazatel> the filename will likely NOT actually be the same as what I've got, but it's an example.
[10:59:43] <Alina-malina> http://i.imgur.com/iwo83AM.jpg  i understand
[10:59:59] <Alina-malina> i mean the code syntax is not highlighted, it is just an html page source there
[11:00:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah select that dropdown to the right of "all"
[11:00:46] <duch_kazatel> and select the script you want to watch
[11:01:47] <duch_kazatel> then create watch expressions in the appropriate panel on the right, or click on the line number of the line you want to pause on.
[11:02:02] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, no it is not it is still not active syntax:(
[11:02:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:02:23] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it.
[11:03:16] <Alina-malina> maybe it is firfox bug?
[11:03:24] <duch_kazatel> i highly doubt it.
[11:03:39] <duch_kazatel> i use it every day for work.
[11:03:48] <Alina-malina> well it is not working:(
[11:03:57] <duch_kazatel> why not create a fiddle?
[11:04:05] <duch_kazatel> you seem really resistant to that.
[11:04:15] <Alina-malina> no i am not, i dont love fiddler
[11:04:19] <Alina-malina> i cant use it:(
[11:04:29] <Alina-malina> this script is very compicated, i dont think i can make it work
[11:04:32] <Alina-malina> i hasitate to use it
[11:04:44] <duch_kazatel> are your script sources using absolute URLs?
[11:04:54] <Alina-malina> it is not my script it is a website
[11:05:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:06:54] <Alina-malina> it is ff problem, same with google
[11:06:58] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:07:02] <Alina-malina> i just only see javascript code in plaintext
[11:07:03] <Alina-malina> :(
[11:07:14] <duch_kazatel> none of what you're saying makes sense.
[11:07:31] <Alina-malina> just a moment i will make a screehshot for sense
[11:08:35] <Bloomberg> someone here has worked with scrollabletab jquery plugin?
[11:08:38] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/L1Uy3Mw.gif
[11:08:39] <grafi> :P
[11:08:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh god
[11:08:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:09:58] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, http://i.imgur.com/pGKNjPR.jpg
[11:10:13] <duch_kazatel> LMAO
[11:10:39] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina that's acting as expected - the script panel shows you whatever was sent. you're looking at minified code.
[11:10:43] <duch_kazatel> that's intended behavior.
[11:11:09] <dfletcher> paste that into jsfiddle ;p
[11:11:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: im gonna loo kfor some codepens might find something interesting
[11:11:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> for raido buttons
[11:11:41] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina are you working on your OWN code, or somebody else's?
[11:11:43] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, firebug doesnt handle minified code?
[11:11:52] <Alina-malina> of coarse somebody esles
[11:12:16] <TheEternalAbyss> back
[11:12:17] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina I'm not aware of any developer tool setup that handles minified code out of the box.
[11:12:20] <duch_kazatel> I could be wrong though.
[11:12:32] <dfletcher> Alina-malina, it "handles" it just fine. but minified means the line breaks were removed. so saying stop at line 7 doesn't mean much because there's no newlines. they were removed to optimize it for transport
[11:12:42] <grafi> well chrome can prettify
[11:12:44] <duch_kazatel> you can use this with firebug to accomplish that: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript-deminifier/
[11:12:47] <grafi> but its not ideal
[11:13:16] <dfletcher> google's source is a terrible place to learn ;)
[11:13:17] <duch_kazatel> oh wow, yeah, chrome has a pretty print option.
[11:13:27] <Alina-malina> what about jqery?
[11:13:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: welcome back
[11:13:37] <dfletcher> what about jquery?
[11:13:42] <duch_kazatel> so Alina-malina what is your goal here?
[11:13:42] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks
[11:13:47] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to learn javascript?
[11:14:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: all the good plugins use background images
[11:14:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> and sprite sheets
[11:14:13] <Alina-malina> i want to find one function, there is one website so i am trying to make a similiar game, but need to know every step it is doing
[11:14:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think that is the way to go
[11:14:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> it will decrease issues with icon fonts
[11:14:44] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui naaaah https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/b3gknDa.gif
[11:14:45] <grafi> :P
[11:14:50] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina err, you're looking for one function, but don't know what function it is?  how do you know it's one function?
[11:15:15] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina you might need to download and read the code manually.
[11:15:28] <duch_kazatel> or use a pretty-print option and step through that way.
[11:15:38] <TheEternalAbyss> wait...
[11:15:49] <TheEternalAbyss> Alina-malina is trying to reverse engineer a game?
[11:15:49] <grafi> stop
[11:15:52] <grafi> hammer time
[11:15:57] <dlam> $.parseHTML()  seems to return an Array of nodes,  how do i combine em all into a string so I can inject it somewhere?
[11:16:21] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss it looks more like they don't know what they're doing, but think they do.

[11:21:04] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss my god you are old :P
[11:21:05] <duch_kazatel> dlam you'd have to iterate through every index of the array it returns and concat to a big ol' string.

[11:21:36] <grafi> hammertime : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/gcshnBn.gif

[11:27:12] <TheEternalAbyss> there are several out there
[11:27:19] <TheEternalAbyss> the more the merrier
[11:27:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: does http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[11:27:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> work for you
[11:27:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: not so. we want to make it dead simple
[11:27:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> most require complicated classses
[11:27:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> we awant it as simple as
[11:28:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> have ing your html
[11:28:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> and it will do most of the work
[11:28:26] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui what about making it a fille our circle?
[11:28:26] <grafi> :o
[11:28:30] <TheEternalAbyss> actually most ui kits aren't that complicated unless people make them complicated I find

[11:28:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> fille?
[11:29:00] <grafi> filled
[11:29:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> im actually gonna make it like the icheck checkboxes and radio buttons

[11:29:53] <grafi> the way it looks now is still strange looking to me
[11:29:54] <Nomikos> using JS/jQuery obv
[11:30:31] <grafi> maybe its because you dont use even numbers for the stuffs?
[11:30:33] <grafi> :o
[11:30:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: checkmark with rounded corners or without
[11:30:42] <TheEternalAbyss> i think I'm going to try and redo my progress bar without setInterval
[11:30:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: why not fake it
[11:31:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> or do a sudo one
[11:31:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> one a loading gif
[11:31:09] <TheEternalAbyss> it's creating a multithreded heap-o-garbage
[11:31:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> no need for loading bar
[11:31:17] <TheEternalAbyss> i have a loading gif at the moment
[11:31:38] <TheEternalAbyss> but there are some pages on my site that just have massive queries and takes several seconds to load
[11:31:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> use it then
[11:31:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> dw
[11:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> trust if you pick a nice clean and simple gif
[11:31:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> users dont mind
[11:32:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> plus you could have like cute little text
[11:32:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> like

[11:32:38] <TheEternalAbyss> they may not mind, but woul dbe nice to give an actual estimate of time while it loads
[11:32:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi got the idea
[11:32:40] <grafi> what is this
[11:32:42] <grafi> sim city?

[11:33:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> corners
[11:33:25] <grafi> straight
[11:33:26] <grafi> oô
[11:33:30] <TheEternalAbyss> my God I hadn't heard the herding llamas bit in ages.. I had forgoten about that... wow
[11:33:47] <grafi> haha
[11:33:48] <grafi> :P
[11:34:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you sure
[11:34:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> our buttons have slight roundedness to them
[11:34:39] <grafi> take that then
[11:34:41] <grafi> unity
[11:34:43] <grafi> and such
[11:35:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[11:35:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i could relaly use your sass by tonight
[11:35:23] <grafi> oô
[11:35:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> after im done with this checkbox stuff
[11:35:28] <grafi> sure
[11:37:34] <TheEternalAbyss> this sucks.. I have to rethink my entire logic now for the prgress bar. poop.
[11:41:43] <grafi> xD
[11:42:01] <grafi> TheEternalAbyss mind explaining what you have been trying?
[11:42:02] <grafi> :P
[11:44:29] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: well, I have a query that loads a set of data on a page and because it has to join several tables and such... well long story short it just takes on average about 9 seconds to load.. could be less, could be more. so I created a progress bar using html and css and the jquery just updates as the page loads. I was sort of faking it my just using setInterval, but it's threading/scoping is screwing it all up when I was to 
[11:45:11] <grafi> i see
[11:45:13] <TheEternalAbyss> because I was going to just ballpark it up to a point... let it "load" for 7 seconds and then halt at 97% until the load was complete, then I'd resume and hide the progress bar
[11:45:23] <grafi> so its not like you are showing real calculable progress
[11:45:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: why is this font not vertically centering ugh
[11:45:47] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: no I wasn't, but honestly, i'd prefer to show real time progress
[11:45:47] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui apparently you suck at css xD
[11:46:03] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: lmao
[11:46:08] <grafi> 9 seconds for a query is terrible
[11:46:17] <grafi> any chance to cache results or something?
[11:46:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: shhhhhh
[11:46:34] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui hahaha
[11:46:36] <grafi> :P
[11:46:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> you take a crack
[11:46:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold
[11:46:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me uplaod
[11:46:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> to master
[11:47:06] <TheEternalAbyss> caching results? eh it can change depending on what the user wants to see
[11:47:28] <TheEternalAbyss> the problem is a aubquery and sorting on top of that
[11:47:33] <TheEternalAbyss> so it takes some time
[11:47:38] <TheEternalAbyss> subquery*
[11:47:48] <grafi> sounds terrifying
[11:47:53] <TheEternalAbyss> and it's a large dataset too
[11:48:16] <grafi> and the db is all optimized and shit?
[11:48:20] <TheEternalAbyss> it is yes
[11:48:28] <grafi> that sucks man
[11:48:32] <grafi> i feel for you
[11:48:33] <grafi> :P
[11:48:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i beat you
[11:49:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> it was a hack lets see if you can spot it
[11:49:04] <grafi> what are you
[11:49:05] <TheEternalAbyss> eventually the team here plans on re-optimizing everything and reworking the queries a bit, but that could be minimum a year down the line
[11:49:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold uplaoding
[11:49:10] <grafi> like chris brown or something?
[11:49:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:49:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> yeah yeah yeah
[11:49:28] <grafi> im not uploading anything
[11:49:30] <grafi> :o
[11:49:43] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: There's no progress bad plugin you can use to accomplish this? It's a really common thing.
[11:49:56] <grafi> progress bad
[11:49:58] <grafi> i like it
[11:49:59] <grafi> ^^
[11:50:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol grafi im uplaoding
[11:50:28] <grafi> then why should i hold uploading
[11:50:28] <grafi> oô
[11:51:04] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: not sure.. I've seen a few but they are either ugly, or I need to include a whole bunch of stuff which won't help the load time. Plus I really want to just create a drop in and use module that I can then make available to anyone
[11:51:16] <TheEternalAbyss> which is mostly html/css
[11:51:35] <TheEternalAbyss> as much as I like jquery, I'm a webdev purist to an extent
[11:52:06] <TheEternalAbyss> my philosophy is to use as little code/libraries as possible for the job
[11:52:16] <grafi> that sounds unreasonable ^^
[11:53:14] <TheEternalAbyss> why? the web is so bloated and crossbrowser problems abbound thanks to all those frameworks, non standard html/css usage, libraries, and such.. not to mentione the failures of browsers to use standards
[11:53:35] <TheEternalAbyss> oh and fucking CMSes. don't forget fucking CMSes
[11:53:41] <grafi> that was clearly sarcasm amigo
[11:53:47] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[11:53:48] <thesisb> TheEternalAbyss: thats how everything is, the web is just more visible
[11:53:55] <grafi> should i go search my sarcasm shield?
[11:53:55] <grafi> :p
[11:54:19] <TheEternalAbyss> thesisb: it is, true, but there's no reason to not have clean, efficient, non bloaty mcbloat bloat code
[11:54:31] <TheEternalAbyss> grafi: shields are down captain
[11:54:39] <grafi> i meant sign
[11:54:41] <grafi> i think

[12:11:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> what transition
[12:11:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> its usepr fast for me
[12:12:00] <grafi> when toggling radio buttons?
[12:12:18] <grafi> it looks weird for me
[12:13:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i updated timing
[12:13:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> im still not getting the timing changed
[12:13:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> intersting

[12:15:35] <grafi> ^^
[12:16:22] <grafi> the edges are bad in ie

[12:18:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> hence why i wanted to use background iamges
[12:18:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> we wil lfix that later
[12:18:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i but of border and box shadow can help with that
[12:18:43] <grafi> hack the hack
[12:18:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> the transitions arent workign for me nor the positioning is good in ie
[12:18:44] <grafi> sure
[12:19:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> why am i not seeing the animation'
[12:19:22] <grafi> idk
[12:20:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: funny thing button animation s work

[12:25:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> you dont liekt hem
[12:26:00] <jsc802> hi quick question
[12:26:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[12:26:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> no quick questions
[12:26:08] <jsc802> can i use #() instead of $()?
[12:26:14] <grafi> oô
[12:26:19] <grafi> wat
[12:26:21] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 why
[12:26:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsc802: im kidding
[12:26:25] <jsc802> jQuery( document ).ready(function( # ) {
[12:26:27] <jsc802> to avoid conflict
[12:26:36] <grafi> with what
[12:26:36] <grafi> oô
[12:26:46] <jsc802> appframework
[12:26:49] <duch_kazatel> conflict with... prototype.js?
[12:26:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so oyu dont like the radio button as they are?
[12:27:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i thought you liked these http://damirfoy.com/iCheck/
[12:27:15] <grafi> the transition looks weird
[12:27:25] <grafi> when you toggle to another
[12:27:40] <grafi> jsc802 # is not a valid char for a variable name
[12:27:42] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:27:47] <grafi> afaik
[12:27:48] <jsc802> is there a recommended alternative to $?
[12:27:55] <duch_kazatel> the word jQuery
[12:28:06] <jsc802> too long :P
[12:28:09] <jsc802> i like my code to be pretty
[12:28:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: transitions dont work for me at all so
[12:28:24] <duch_kazatel> look at the noConflict link.
[12:28:35] <grafi> just wrap it into (function($) {})(jQuery) use $ inside?
[12:28:51] <duch_kazatel> that's another option.
[12:28:52] <jsc802> i want to use other $. library inside it too
[12:28:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: can you take acrack at it
[12:28:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> im too lazy
[12:29:12] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 what's the other lib?
[12:29:16] <jsc802> the noConflict link doesn't mention anything about using # as an alternate variable
[12:29:23] <grafi> name it j then?
[12:29:24] <grafi> idk
[12:29:32] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 you can't use #
[12:29:39] <jsc802> what about @
[12:30:13] <_rgn> nope
[12:30:29] <duch_kazatel> http://mothereff.in/js-variables
[12:30:33] <_rgn> $$
[12:30:43] <jsc802> thanku
[12:30:55] <duch_kazatel> your code is going to be way unreadable if you use that.
[12:31:01] <duch_kazatel> and $ is one thing but $$ is another.
[12:31:26] <duch_kazatel> ಠ_ಠ is a valid name though - go with that.
[12:31:52] <grafi> hard to type though xD
[12:32:41] <jsc802> hehe
[12:32:45] <jsc802> i am going to use π
[12:32:52] <duch_kazatel> it'll still be more maintainable and readable long term.
[12:32:53] <jsc802> simple + pretty
[12:32:59] <grafi> i mean
[12:33:01] <grafi> use jquery
[12:33:07] <grafi> and let the minifier
[12:33:09] <grafi> minify
[12:33:10] <grafi> ...
[12:33:25] <grafi> n seems like a bad idea ^^
[12:33:51] <duch_kazatel> he didn't use n lol
[12:33:57] <duch_kazatel> use theta or something else.
[12:33:59] <grafi> [21:32:42] <jsc802> i am going to use π
[12:34:05] <jsc802> pi
[12:34:07] <duch_kazatel> that's pi./
[12:34:08] <duch_kazatel> not n
[12:34:22] <grafi> lol
[12:34:31] <grafi> looks totally like an n for me xD
[12:34:49] <duch_kazatel>  π n <- those look the same?
[12:34:54] <grafi> yup

[12:36:17] <shoky> grafi likes girly fonts
[12:36:31] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[12:36:34] <grafi> i think thats ubuntu mono
[12:36:36] <grafi> or something
[12:36:36] <grafi> xD
[12:37:26] <jragon> I'm having a few problems getting acts as list to work with update, at least I think it's acts as list which is causing the issues. If you take a look at the console.log you'll see the 'no method error' for 'position was'. Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/Jragon/7777049 (also the update function responds only to JSON)
[12:38:06] <duch_kazatel> jragon where's the jquery?
[12:39:03] <jragon> Oh shoot, wrong channel! Sorry
[12:39:08] <jragon> That was meant to be for Rails
[12:39:23] <jragon> I'm so sorry duch_kazatel
[12:39:33] <grafi> xD
[12:39:47] <duch_kazatel> hahaha it's cool.
[12:39:51] <duch_kazatel> i was about to say.
[12:40:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: still no luck
[12:40:41] <grafi> hm
[12:40:58] <grafi> have you tried turning it off and on again? xD
[12:41:04] <Dev0n> "The opposite of jQuery's .is() method is not .not(), it is !.is()"... well... you're telling me this after 1 hour, great :(
[12:41:07] <Dev0n> heh XD
[12:42:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what you mean?
[12:46:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i think it just doesnt work for before elements
[12:46:31] <hailwood> Hi guys, on focus of a contenteditable div I am appending an icon to it (abs positioned). on blur I am removing the icon. Issue is that I want the icon to be clickable. but the blur event get's fired before the click event on the icon, so the icon is removed before the click event can fire. What is the best way around this?
[12:46:55] <grafi> you may be correct
[12:47:18] <grafi> so you are seeing the other transition animation stuff on the radio buttons then?
[12:49:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont see on ardio button
[12:49:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> but when i apply to label
[12:49:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> NOT label:before i see transition
[12:49:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[12:50:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: apparently icheck too doesnt ahve smooth trasntions

[13:01:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> i hate you firefox users
[13:01:13] <grafi> cool story
[13:01:15] <grafi> ._.
[13:01:35] <grafi> works for us firefox users though :p
[13:01:41] <grafi> hahaha
[13:02:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[13:02:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> itr ied all sorts of code pends
[13:03:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> code pens too
[13:03:41] <fiveop> when I remove elements via $(selector).empty() from a document, will the event handlers attached to any of the removed elements be removed?
[13:04:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: works here too http://jsfiddle.net/xwmWK/
[13:05:12] <duch_kazatel> fiveop from the jquery api docs: "To avoid memory leaks, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers from the child elements before removing the elements themselves."
[13:05:57] <fiveop> thanks
[13:06:07] <fiveop> looks like I'm looking for detached
[13:06:12] <fiveop> detach
[13:06:28] <duch_kazatel> fiveop what's the issue?
[13:07:47] <fiveop> I create parts of the page in memory and switch out parts dynamically, when a part gets shown for a second time (after being removed with .empty()) all the handlers of its descendents are removed
[13:08:07] <duch_kazatel> fiveop you should check out using event delegation if you haven't yet.
[13:08:12] <duch_kazatel> that way those things don't matter.
[13:08:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so pissued over this right now
[13:08:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> it worked before
[13:08:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> im sure
[13:08:59] <fiveop> duch_kazatel: got a link for that?
[13:09:00] <grafi> im not :y
[13:09:01] <grafi> :P
[13:09:29] <duch_kazatel> fiveop http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:09:51] <fiveop> thanks
[13:10:23] <duch_kazatel> fiveop you'd do something like this: $(parentToBindOn).on('click', 'childSelector', function(){});
[13:10:40] <duch_kazatel> as long as parentToBindOn doesn't get removed ever, you're golden.
[13:11:09] <fiveop> problem is, currently my children don't have any ids or classes that I could use for selection
[13:11:25] <duch_kazatel> are you wholesale targeting all, say, 'a' tags?
[13:11:34] <fiveop> I create them with $(document.createElement("button")) for example
[13:11:45] <fiveop> and then I can just do myButton.click(...)
[13:11:48] <duch_kazatel> do you want to bind to all of that type?
[13:11:52] <fiveop> no
[13:12:14] <duch_kazatel> you can check context or, instead, add a class to all of them, then.
[13:12:58] <duch_kazatel> you probably know this, but if you can target the specific buttons you want using CSS, you can use that for your selector there, too/
[13:13:19] <fiveop> I know
[13:13:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: wait but you said you dont like these checkboxes right?
[13:13:42] <duch_kazatel> mmk.  i'd suggest adding a class instead of directly binding the handler - that's a little cleaner IMO.
[13:13:55] <duch_kazatel> and with that I go to lunch
[13:14:40] <grafi> the transitions looks weird
[13:14:42] <grafi> :P
[13:14:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> well not for you
[13:14:49] <grafi> well for me
[13:14:56] <grafi> for you there is no transition
[13:15:02] <grafi> no?
[13:15:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[13:15:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> there is no transition
[13:15:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay if i give you my source could you see if you can fix
[13:15:31] <grafi> so you cant even see that it looks weird ^^

[13:48:28] <grafi> even though the edges look shitty in ff and ie?
[13:48:29] <grafi> oô
[13:50:14] <bigbugjava> Hi, I use this code: "$(':checkbox').on('click',function()" , and then use it, it works great, but only from secand click, any ideas why that can happend?
[13:52:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: edges ill work out
[13:52:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> you work out the transitions
[13:53:20] <grafi> any idea how you will work that out? ^^
[13:54:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> well the edges can be fixed with a combination of borders which is fixed in ie11
[13:55:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just tried it and box shadow
[13:55:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[13:55:29] <grafi> if you say so ^^
[13:56:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi i got that covered do the transitions
[13:56:31] <grafi> dont tell me what to do
[13:56:32] <grafi> ^^
[13:57:09] * shoky whips grafi
[13:58:33] <grafi> i like that

[14:00:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[14:02:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: got idea
[14:03:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> try using ::before
[14:03:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: read: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before
[14:03:29] <grafi> you know that constant highlighting is kind of sucky
[14:03:29] <grafi> :P
[14:05:11] <grafi> doesnt help though
[14:05:17] <grafi> the ::before
[14:05:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats css3 notation
[14:05:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay ill stop bothering
[14:05:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me know if you com up with somethign
[14:10:02] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui so the transition seems to work when i toggle the :checked background-color in the devtools manually oô
[14:10:12] <grafi> but not when activating the other radio
[14:10:12] <grafi> ...
[14:10:14] <grafi> thats werid
[14:10:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[14:10:29] <Pedroshow> sup guys, someone know a good lightbox that works with cycle2?
[14:11:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: could it be possible since we are dealing with inputs it could be not activating
[14:12:20] <grafi> something like that
[14:12:23] <grafi> i mean
[14:12:25] <grafi> it must be
[14:12:47] <grafi> but why does it work in ff and how can we fix it ^^
[14:13:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[14:13:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[14:13:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> well try to do transitions in a div
[14:13:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> and see what you get
[14:14:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> independent of a radio button
[14:14:43] <Pedroshow> sup guys, someone know a good lightbox that works with cycle2?
[14:14:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: we do have 1 last option
[14:14:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> but that is last resort
[14:14:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> keyframe animations
[14:14:46] <grafi> that doesnt bring us closer to any solution though
[14:14:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> keyframes will work
[14:15:07] <grafi> why would they?
[14:15:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pedroshow: create your own
[14:15:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have a feeling they would
[14:15:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> keyframes ahve always worked
[14:15:56] <Pedroshow> create one is not an option now
[14:16:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pedroshow: why not?
[14:17:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: actually support is sketchy for that too
[14:17:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: try this http://kizu.ru/en/pseudos/
[14:17:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> it may assist
[14:19:06] <Pedroshow> Rohan_Bhangui, I dont have time for that, just need a plugin compatible, thinking in modify slimbox
[14:19:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pedroshow: the ndo it
[14:20:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: this may work http://jsfiddle.net/gleezer/4rnsx/228/
[14:20:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> i see what they are saying
[14:20:54] <grafi> i have it
[14:20:57] <grafi> mom:
[14:20:59] <grafi> :o
[14:21:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> you got it working!!!!
[14:21:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[14:21:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD
[14:22:51] <grafi> hm
[14:22:54] <grafi> it seems to me
[14:23:01] <grafi> the content thingie is the perp
[14:24:02] <grafi> hm
[14:24:08] <grafi> that may be a problem then ^^
[14:24:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> i kinda got it working
[14:24:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> tell me
[14:24:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there a way to prevent from :hover from running
[14:25:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[14:27:55] <jcooper> can someone explain this line to me var oldDisplay = numberofitems > 0 ? item[0].style.display : "block";
[14:28:05] <jcooper> i mean what does the ? do
[14:28:19] <jcooper> if first half do the second half?
[14:28:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: very good new!
[14:28:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> keyframe naimations work
[14:28:33] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/238Ch/
[14:28:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> *animations work
[14:28:37] <grafi> what about this
[14:28:52] <ngharo> jcooper: yes, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:
[14:28:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi how in the world.....
[14:29:13] <grafi> [23:22:58] <grafi> the content thingie is the perp
[14:29:21] <grafi> content: "asdfasdf" breaks it
[14:29:30] <grafi> so now im thinking do we really need the content ^^
[14:29:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> we need the checkmark though
[14:30:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> it works
[14:30:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> i got it working with key frames
[14:30:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> tell me is there a way by whcih we can active a class when a radio button is clicked
[14:30:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> in css only
[14:31:37] <grafi> hm
[14:31:52] <grafi> im thinking its the fonts fault somehow oô
[14:32:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[14:33:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> its content in general
[14:33:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> i tire d\2022
[14:33:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> generic char
[14:33:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> it didnt work
[14:33:16] <grafi> http://codepen.io/soulrider911/pen/qhEzf
[14:33:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold im pushing updates
[14:33:19] <grafi> look at this though
[14:33:23] <grafi> its working there
[14:33:24] <grafi> ...
[14:33:33] <grafi> and the method seems to be the same
[14:33:38] <grafi> its weird
[14:33:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> i spot some sass
[14:33:55] <grafi> sure
[14:34:00] <grafi> but thats not the difference
[14:34:01] <grafi> ...
[14:35:14] <grafi> hm the fiddle works with content
[14:35:22] <grafi> so we broke it somewhere in our css
[14:35:24] <grafi> ...
[14:35:38] <grafi> outside the radio stuff from the fiddle
[14:35:38] <grafi> oô
[14:35:40] <grafi> whaaaa
[14:35:56] <Zee4Q> is it tricky to make a sliding menu come from the right rather than from above?
[14:36:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: keep goin on your line of thought
[14:36:54] <grafi> shouldnt be Zee4Q
[14:36:58] <grafi> i am
[14:37:03] <grafi> cutting down css now ^^
[14:37:22] <Zee4Q> what would one modify? the css of the menu's parts?
[14:37:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: here you go http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[14:40:06] <grafi> Zee4Q dont know show code?
[14:40:27] <Zee4Q> http://coffeeonmars.com/W150/assignments/Asst_11/slide.html#
[14:40:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Zee4Q: are you looking for one of those ios style off canvas menus?
[14:41:00] <Zee4Q> I guess so..but I also want to understand what controls this thing
[14:41:09] <Zee4Q> CSS handles part of it, this I know
[14:43:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Zee4Q: http://codepen.io/jasonhowmans/pen/dykhL
[14:43:49] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui i see how the dude in the codepen did it, the content is in the ::after and positionend absolutely
[14:44:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> ????
[14:44:05] <grafi> so it looks like its over the ::before
[14:44:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> meaning?
[14:44:26] <grafi> meaning the animation stuff with the backgroundcolor is in the ::before
[14:44:38] <grafi> and the content which would break that is in the ::after
[14:44:40] <grafi> not breaking it
[14:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[14:45:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting
[14:45:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay new task for you
[14:45:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> you up for it
[14:45:34] <Enyx> Hi, could someone help me with this: i'm trying to create a plugin for a website, and for that i want to run a function that is normaly triggered by a click somewhere on the website. I tried a lot of things but i'm unable to retrieve what function is called :/ could you help me ?
[14:46:07] <grafi> havent even finished the old task you slaver
[14:46:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol grafi its done
[14:46:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> i fixed it
[14:46:20] <Rohan_Bhangui>  http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[14:46:26] <grafi> pah!
[14:46:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> the magic of keyframes
[14:46:46] <jcooper> is it better to check to see if class is already applied before doing .addclass
[14:46:47] <Nomikos> Enyx: can you not just trigger the click to have it run?
[14:47:13] <Nomikos> Enyx: also, with debugging tools you can pause execution and go step by step to see what happens where, and what is called
[14:47:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> jcooper: adding a class to somethign that already has that class that your ading will do nothing
[14:48:32] <Enyx> Nomikos: sadly no, the link is on a pannel that is deleted when not used, so i can't trigger it unless the pannel is open, i tried using the debuging tool, but it doesnt show the function called .... idk why ...
[14:49:34] <Nomikos> Enyx: got a url?
[14:49:37] <Enyx> Nomikos: The thing is using jQuery but in a very strange way everything is using a.this and stuff like that it seems it was obsucated...
[14:49:45] <Nomikos> no promises but happy to poke, little else to do atm
[14:49:47] <Enyx> Nomikos: yea but you ned to be loged in to see that
[14:50:00] <Nomikos> got a url and an account? :-)
[14:50:02] <Enyx> Nomikos: http://plug.dj/ and join any room
[14:50:18] <jcooper> if i have li_tags = $('ul#list').children()  whats the fastest way to add a class to all of them
[14:50:33] <jcooper> li_tags.addclass()?
[14:51:02] <goldr046> addClass()
[14:51:27] <jcooper> do i have to increment through them?
[14:51:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you think you can fix the whole ie thing?
[14:53:56] <Nomikos> Enyx: oooohkay. where's this tab?
[14:54:06] <Nomikos> before my cpu melts
[14:54:30] <Enyx> Nomikos: 2nd tab on the right -userlist- i want to trigger what is triggered when clicking an username
[14:54:47] <Enyx> Nomikos: it is also triggered if you click any little avatars on the middle of the screen
[14:56:38] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/ByqvAJJ.gif
[14:57:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh come on
[14:57:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have done so much work on this
[14:57:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> as if i am the only one
[14:58:01] <Enyx> grafi: nice gif, i steal it :D
[14:58:29] <grafi> what do you even mean, whole ie thing
[14:58:30] <grafi> oô
[14:58:38] <jcooper> can someone tell me why li.style.display = "block"; works but li.addClass('showme'); doesnt
[14:58:46] <jcooper> lis = $('ul#list').children();  li = lis[1];
[14:58:49] <grafi> Enyx please do ;)
[15:03:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> the positioning for checkmark is off for ie grafi can yu fix
[15:06:52] <Nomikos> Enyx: it's not obfuscated, but definitely minified/compressed or somesuch
[15:06:57] <Enyx> Nomikos: you think you can get something ? :/
[15:07:22] <Nomikos> Enyx: in http://plug.dj/_/static/js/room.282d347.js search for 'user-panel', after the second occurrence search for 'click'
[15:07:45] <Nomikos> I think it's.. there somewhere..
[15:08:37] <Nomikos> but it could very well be these are functions that are not accessible from outside that object. I know too little about JS to say if it's possible to call them separately..
[15:10:24] <Nomikos> for more fun, http://plug.dj/_/static/js/core.8784530.js switches writing direction about 5/6th through the file (according to firefox anyway) you can do a search for function and find noitcnuf
[15:10:29] <Enyx> Nomikos: i don't even get how it work ...
[15:10:30] <Enyx> .on("click",this.clickBind)
[15:10:46] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui finxing it in ie means breaking it everywhere else ^^
[15:10:51] <Nomikos> yeah, it's not your image-rollover variety JS
[15:11:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> not necessarily
[15:11:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> you really dont want to do this grunt work do you grafi ?
[15:12:10] <grafi> what ive just tried fixing the position
[15:12:18] <grafi> works when you adjust lineheight
[15:12:23] <grafi> screws it up everywhere else
[15:12:25] <grafi> of course
[15:12:34] <grafi> now researching why that is
[15:12:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[15:12:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[15:12:44] <grafi> ie just sucks
[15:12:45] <grafi> :P
[15:13:09] <grafi> it shows all applied styles with a stroke through them
[15:13:13] <grafi> how fucked up is that oô
[15:14:12] <Enyx> Nomikos: thank you gonna keep searching, i cant even copy/paste the code ... it fail to copy the whole code :(
[15:14:58] <Nomikos> Enyx: good luck, you're gonna need it
[15:15:22] <Enyx> Nomikos: ty :)
[15:18:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i think i fixed its not perfect but close enough http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[15:19:53] <grafi> loooks just as shitty as before in ie
[15:19:53] <grafi> oô
[15:19:56] <grafi> doesnt it?
[15:20:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[15:20:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> but its lcose enough
[15:21:06] <grafi> so basically you fixed nothing
[15:21:09] <grafi> i get it ^^
[15:21:27] <grafi> i think i still would be happy without the sign
[15:21:47] <grafi> on the plus side no positioning troubles ^^
[15:22:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> without what sign?
[15:22:14] <grafi> the checkmark
[15:22:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> how will we distinguish between checkbox and radio button
[15:22:44] <grafi> or putting the checkmark in the ::after element
[15:22:50] <grafi> well checkboxes are not round
[15:22:51] <grafi> ...
[15:22:52] <grafi> sooo
[15:22:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold give me asec

[15:24:22] <grafi> take this as your index
[15:24:23] <grafi> ;)
[15:24:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> also ie adds some stupid padding under the ::before elelent
[15:24:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> ??? lo
[15:24:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> *lol

[18:41:51] <Guest53835> hi, why wont the dialog show up on click ? http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/8/
[18:50:35] <Guest53835> am I doing something wrong?
[19:04:16] <entrope> Competition is already over but at URL: https://www.wf-site.com/microsite/pages/53efd21cd0540c0574742880589433b3 - I am curious how could you make a script to auto reload just the specific <button value="xxxxxxx"> ? Page refreshes even after vote on only Safari browser. All other browsers block reload
[19:13:23] <jabohemian> is $('[name="ElementNameHere"]') faster than other attribute selectors?
[19:13:53] <jabohemian> does jquery use dom getElementsByName()?
[19:14:33] <BillCriswell> jabohemian: I think it makes use mostly of querySelectorAll() or whatever when it's available.
[19:15:10] <jabohemian> yeah but it certainly makes us dom getElementById for id selector
[19:16:40] <BillCriswell> jabohemian: Would make sense.
[19:16:52] <Guest53835> hi, why wont the dialog show up on click ? http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/8/
[19:16:54] <Guest53835> am I doing something wrong?
[19:36:34] <jabohemian> Guest53835: you could try a hack like this
[19:36:35] <jabohemian> http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/10/
[19:38:42] <BillCriswell> Ehhh, be careful setting ids with a number first.
[19:41:49] <jabohemian> that was just a dumb example, id could be anything
[19:41:58] <jabohemian> not sure why his code dont work tho
[19:42:24] <BillCriswell> jabohemian: dialog() moves the element to right before </body>
[19:42:33] <BillCriswell> well.. appends it to body.
[19:42:53] <entrope> nobody can help me right?
[19:43:04] <BillCriswell> entrope: No god damn way.
[19:43:08] <entrope> Lol
[19:43:13] <BillCriswell> Just kidding. What was the question?
[19:44:17] <entrope> Competition is over but at URL: https://www.wf-site.com/microsite/pages/53efd21cd0540c0574742880589433b3 - All browsers only allow 1 vote but Safari. Regardless is there a way but value button to remotely click the Vote button without refresh?
[19:47:04] <Blaster> Hey I am doing $.ajax and getting a 500 response but the error key function isn't being called.  How come?
[19:47:44] <jabohemian> entrope: look at the page in firebug and see what the post actually looks like
[19:47:53] <entrope> Rgr that, one sec
[19:49:54] <entrope> Looks like: http://pastebin.com/V9YmkiHB
[19:52:07] <Blaster> nevermind, error function was being called, jsut wasn't doing the right thing inside of it
[19:53:04] <jabohemian> no i meant use firebug net panel to see what was actually getting posted, and then using php curl to keep sending those headers
[19:53:46] <jabohemian> or change the User-Agent header to safari or whatever
[19:54:39] <jabohemian> thats what i would do, im sure other options exist
[19:55:51] <Guest53835> jabohemian,  thx
[20:06:01] <libin> i am trying to download images from the server to local storage using xhr, but i only get the last image
[20:06:14] <Blaster> hey guys i am having trouble stopping the animation.. http://jsfiddle.net/zujLJ/2/
[20:06:22] <Blaster> how do I clearTimeout properly with this?
[20:07:17] <gahh> So according to the docs, in 1.9 a selector like "input[value=abc]" now always selects be the value attribute, how do I select by comparison the value property?
[20:17:26] <BillCriswell> gahh: I'd use .filter()
[20:17:46] <BillCriswell> $('input').filter(function(){ return this.value === 'abc'; })
[20:20:17] <BillCriswell> libin: Sounds like a closure issue?
[20:23:29] <libin> BillCriswell : this is my code, if you dont mind can u tell me where is it: http://textdump.net/read/3578/
[20:23:59] <libin> it is the replaceImages function
[20:24:28] <fattest> how do i use or for this statement? $('#Course').change(function(){ --->  $('#Course') or #course2
[20:28:13] <BillCriswell> fattest: It can be either or those elements?
[20:30:35] <Quest> jabohemian question regarding http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/10/ , why does the .dialog makes the element move uneer the <body> tag?
[20:31:10] <BillCriswell> fattest: Oh duh. You should probably just put a class on #course and #course2 and just do $('.someClass').change()... If that's not an option $('#course,#course2').change(); works.
[20:31:14] <Quest> jabohemian I mean this one: $( ".attachment-content" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false });
[20:33:17] <Quest> any one else?
[20:34:17] <BillCriswell> Quest: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-appendTo
[20:35:08] <Quest> hm
[20:35:39] <Quest> BillCriswell well, why doesnt the dialog REMAIN where it was in the first place?
[20:36:16] <Quest> BillCriswell one hack is to do appendTo : $(this)
[20:36:21] <Quest> in the fiddle case
[20:36:43] <Quest> BillCriswell but why... does the moving to body tag happens?
[20:37:14] <BillCriswell> Quest: I imagine it's because it needs to be absolutely positioned and if you put it inside a relatively positoined element that'll fuck shit up.
[20:39:19] <emma> what is the purpose of jquery?
[20:39:23] <Quest> BillCriswell hm.
[20:39:55] <Quest> emma to give short, featurefull, cross browser javascript alternative code
[20:40:16] <Quest> emma its a library made on top of javascript
[20:40:46] <BillCriswell> emma: "To make javascript fun" I think was john's original goal.
[20:41:09] <Quest> BillCriswell he succeeded then
[20:42:35] <BillCriswell> Quest: Agreed.
[20:43:35] <BillCriswell> http://ejohn.org/blog/barcampnyc-wrap-up/#postcomment the comments here are interesting... there used to be a jQuery browser.
[20:46:13] <Quest> BillCriswell tried to hack the dialog, any ideas why this is not working? (dont want to go with ids) http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/11/   ?
[20:47:13] <BillCriswell> Quest: Why not?
[20:48:11] <Quest> BillCriswell thats what I was curious of.
[20:48:27] <BillCriswell> I mean why didn't you want to use the ids?
[20:48:59] <Quest> just a preference
[20:52:34] <Quest> BillCriswell hm. Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[20:54:57] <BillCriswell> Quest: When you set up the dialog it doesn't change .foo to a modal, it takes .foo and puts it into a modal. You'd need to create the dialog when it's clicked and destroy it when it's closed.
[20:57:36] <Quest> BillCriswell I see the dialog is not appended to $(this)
[20:57:54] <Quest> it should
[20:59:32] <Quest> BillCriswell despite iam doing appentTo: $(this)
[20:59:58] <jabohemian> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-appendTo
[21:00:01] <jabohemian> (version added: 1.10.0)
[21:00:08] <jabohemian> that could be why
[21:00:10] <BillCriswell> Quest: http://jsbin.com/iFupuQad/1/edit?html,js,output Is this closer to what you were shooting for?
[21:00:35] <jabohemian> also appenD
[21:02:05] <BillCriswell> As soon as you call dialog on an element it'll be moved no matter what so .children('.foo') won't work while the dialog "exists"
[21:02:42] <jabohemian> even if you append it to the element?
[21:03:36] <BillCriswell> jabohemian: Yes. That's where it'll append the jQuery's dialog markup, not the element that's being added to the dialog.
[21:04:07] <jabohemian> ah
[21:04:24] <Quest> BillCriswell why do you think appentTo: $(this) is not working
[21:04:44] <jabohemian> lol just explained it
[21:04:49] <Quest> jabohemian oh
[21:05:14] <Quest> jabohemian "appenD" ?
[21:05:30] <jabohemian> no, i mean BillCriswell just explained why it won't work, unfortunately
[21:05:43] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/iFupuQad/1/edit is this not good enough?
[21:05:48] <Quest> jabohemian ya. i read it late
[21:07:12] <Quest> BillCriswell hm.
[21:08:08] <jabohemian> nice
[21:11:14] <Quest> BillCriswell jabohemian but why doesnt it works in my case and shows the contents of dialog http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/16/ ?
[21:11:30] <Quest> the one that BillCriswell used i mean
[21:12:59] <BillCriswell> Quest: http://jsbin.com/iFupuQad/2/edit?html,js,output look at the console and what's going on with the element through the process.
[21:13:52] <BillCriswell> Quest: http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/17/
[21:14:56] <gahh> http://jsfiddle.net/dYfBL/6/ , why does it not filter out the two text boxes?
[21:14:57] <Quest> BillCriswell what was wrong?
[21:15:09] <BillCriswell> Quest: You had visibility: none set.
[21:16:26] <Quest> BillCriswell........ hhhaaa.. I dont think i would become a great programmer
[21:16:43] <BillCriswell> Quest: Just a CSS mistake. It wasn't a big deal.
[21:16:58] <Quest> BillCriswell careless mistake. thanks a lot by the way
[21:17:01] <BillCriswell> Quest: Just get more familiar with dev tools and it'll start to make more sense.
[21:17:06] <BillCriswell> Quest: No problem!
[21:17:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> Quest: dev tools, number 1 asset for diagnostics
[21:17:41] * Rohan_Bhangui endorses BillCriswell 's statement
[21:18:06] <BillCriswell> gahh: because `this` is a form element.
[21:18:14] <BillCriswell> You probably want to filter our their inputs.
[21:21:51] <BillCriswell> gahh: http://jsfiddle.net/dYfBL/7/ However... I think you might be better off using serialize on the form and going through that array to see what to filter out.
[21:23:56] <BillCriswell> gahh: http://jsfiddle.net/dYfBL/8/ perhaps?
[21:24:24] <BillCriswell> 12 minutes on my laptop battery.. I'm such a rebel.
[21:25:16] <Quest> BillCriswell nice. but why do I need a destroy call?    I have made mine to work too http://jsfiddle.net/RJ6QK/18/     but once i click a link , it opens up. but after the close, it does not opens again
[21:26:02] <BillCriswell> Quest: Exactly because of what I explained and demonstrated with the console calls.
[21:26:32] <BillCriswell> Quest: http://jsbin.com/iFupuQad/2/edit look at the console as things are happening.
[21:27:41] <BillCriswell> Quest: .attachment-content does not go back to where it was unless you destroy it.
[21:28:39] <BillCriswell> Quest: "Removes the dialog functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state." http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-destroy
[21:29:26] <Quest> BillCriswell oh oh
[21:31:22] <BillCriswell> Bed time night!
[21:34:33] <devsys> Hi all. Quick question, I have a variable that is populated in one jquery function, but need to access it in another... I am not explaining it well, my code does though: http://jsfiddle.net/P55Mh/

[22:09:03] <tehopeologist> hey all
[22:09:31] <tehopeologist> i'm trying to load multiple google maps divs on the same page, but i can't seem to get it to work, as it's initializing on only an ID
[22:09:45] <tehopeologist> is there a way to do it by class?  i know byclassname gives an array
[22:09:58] <tehopeologist> do i need to loop through the array and initialize it each time per array?
[22:36:04] <__equinox> how do I remove a class that starts with the word beginning with 'validate' in one of my element
[22:40:12] <lite_> How would I go about positioning an element to the right of(and outside of the view of another element? The point here is that I'd like to temporarily slide an element over another on mouseover. so : mouseOver -> element comes sliding halfway in from the right -> MouseLeave -> element leaves to the right again

[23:41:04] <jop008> Make a site look nice on ipad/phone
[23:41:25] <Cork> have you checked that those classes exist on <html> ?
[23:41:25] <jop008> Now I have huge letters like this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-12-04_at_7.55.16_AM-k0TDtu17.png
[23:41:37] <Cork> jop008: an image doesn't help
[23:41:58] <jop008> A bit at least you see what I am trying to say
[23:42:19] <Cork> it's going to to a mechanic with a photo of the car and asking why it isn't starting
[23:42:25] <Cork> *it's like going
[23:42:45] <Cork> 1. make sure the classes you look for exist
[23:43:14] <Cork> 2. check so there isn't a more specific selector overriding your rules
[23:43:29] <jop008> this is the code on desktop http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/82/
[23:43:51] <jop008> But on desktop it appears okay
[23:44:00] <jop008> Only on ipad huge letters
[23:44:18] <Cork> so check what you have on the ipad
[23:44:24] <jop008> I try to use media queries
[23:44:46] <jop008> What to check for?
[23:44:57] <Cork> check 7 lines up
[23:46:28] <jop008> How to check for classes?
[23:47:40] <Cork> well either developer tools, view source or alert it from js
[23:47:43] <Cork> there is many ways
[23:48:20] <jop008> alert it from js?
[23:48:31] <jop008> I have thses as media queries
