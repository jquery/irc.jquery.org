[00:21:17] <grafi> Auctus not when you have it all inside .ready() i dont think, never had problems with show, I would be curious to know if fadeIn() instead of show() behaves differently for you.

[02:31:29] <wh0ami> hi
[02:31:51] <wh0ami> im trying to do a crossdomain request and i cant find the error/problem why dont work, http://pastebin.com/tNyQrFXe
[02:33:19] <byungmat> @ whoami : your pastebin doesn't tell much...
[02:33:31] <wh0ami> what i must post?
[02:33:39] <byungmat> can I see how u r using ur code?
[02:33:45] <wh0ami> yes
[02:34:23] <byungmat> like: "function called from aaa.com: getname("aaa","bbb.com")

[02:39:14] <wh0ami> byungmat: in #javascript 1 guy said me, Do server where you request the file from allow cross domain requests, wh0ami?
[02:39:21] <wh0ami> and the domain isnt mine
[02:39:26] <wh0ami> so i think nope
[02:39:40] <wh0ami> no way to get data/info from the other page?
[02:40:01] <byungmat> wait...there's a Mozilla dev network article on this...
[02:40:50] <byungmat> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Cross-Site_XMLHttpRequest
[02:43:46] <byungmat> here's a better one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[03:03:04] <byungmat1> @whoami but if you can't make the external server's admin to do that for you, you can always use your server as a proxy (i.e. your client connects to your server --> your server connects to the external server, receives data --> your server returns the received data to the client)
[03:04:22] <byungmat1> all of this is for security - xmlhttprequest and other access to external domain's resources might fiddle with other domain's cookies/csrf tokens/etc.
[04:24:43] <wh0ami> http://pastebin.com/ubYvUNTR why 1st console.log works as intended but the 2nd not?

[04:42:40] <ScYo> hello
[04:42:56] <ScYo> i have a question regarding css styling of UI widgets
[04:43:29] <ScYo> where can i find all the css classes for a widget?
[04:43:51] <ScYo> im tired of crawling the sourcecode for the css classes in question
[04:45:17] <ScYo> im just gonna stay here and w8. please be so kind to point me to a resource where i can find all css classes for widget. Thankx guys
[04:45:59] <sayakb> hi guys.. i have an xml here: http://goo.gl/pFiOP and i want a selector to get the value within the <id> tags. can i do that?
[04:46:21] <ScYo> is it xsl-ed afterwards?
[04:46:50] <sayakb> nope
[04:47:00] <ScYo> so how is it displayed?
[04:47:12] <sayakb> raw test. this is an api response
[04:47:19] <sayakb> *text
[04:47:57] <ScYo> dunno if u can access xml with jquery, sry
[04:48:27] <sayakb> np
[04:48:40] <sayakb> let me try to do some more research

[04:58:35] <vinex08> ?
[04:58:57] <amaurea> wc
[04:58:59] <amaurea> oops
[05:04:08] <Kambfhase> Passing `undefined` as the second parameter to .attr() does not change the value. Is that intended bahaviour or a quirk?
[05:05:56] <lenswipee> Kambfhase: change the value of what?
[05:06:36] <Kambfhase> the value of the attribute. Say $('img').attr('src', obj.key);
[05:07:21] <Kambfhase> I am wondering if I need to check for 'key' in obj, before that line.
[05:09:15] <lenswipee> ?attr
[05:09:30] <lenswipee> ?attr()
[05:10:18] <lenswipee> Kambfhase: probably not.
[05:10:47] <ScYo> anyone know a ressource for all the css classes a widget is using? thanx
[05:11:08] <Kambfhase> Yeah, its documented for accessor functions. If they return undefined, the value stays. But the docs dont mention sime value passing.
[05:13:56] <Kambfhase> Ah, found it. Yeah, if the second parameter is `undefined` the values just sty the same.
[05:16:13] <Kambfhase> bit.ly/jqsource to the resque :D
[05:38:44] <Dragooon> WHAT IS JQUERY MOBILE?!?!?!?!?!?!
[05:41:59] <bealtine> the clue is in the name
[05:42:18] <Dragooon> Yay someone's here
[05:51:53] <naught101> I have a table that has 7 rows, the 2nd and 5th of which have the class 'accordion'. When I do $('.view tr:not(.accordion)').hide(); it correctly hides the last two rows. But it doesn't hid the 3rd and 4th row. Any idea why?
[05:52:11] <naught101> hide*
[05:52:48] <Dragooon> Shouldn't it be tr. view:not(.accordion)?
[05:53:47] <naught101> Dragooon: no, this is a table inside a drupal view (hence the 'view'). The selector works correctly for the last two rows
[05:54:23] <Dragooon> Link to a demo page?
[05:54:35] <vinky> if you run the selector in the js console does it select the correct ones?
[05:54:53] <naught101> Dragooon: not at the moment, sorry.
[05:55:08] <naught101> vinky: not even sure how to do that. Pretty new to JS, really
[05:55:22] <vinky> naught101, what browser are you testing in?
[05:55:25] <Dragooon> You sure the rows have the class view and don't have accordion class?
[05:55:33] <naught101> vinky: firefox
[05:55:45] <naught101> Dragooon: absolutely certain :)
[05:56:12] <vinky> naught101, easiest is probably to install firebug then
[05:57:03] <naught101> vinky: I have that. What should I be typing?
[05:59:24] <vinky> open firebug and in the console tab you have >>> at the bottom just type the js you want to execute there
[05:59:28] <naught101> vinky: ok, yes, it works fine in the JS console
[05:59:39] <Dragooon> Something might be showing them then
[06:00:37] <naught101> yeah, ok. I have a $('.view tr:first-child').show(); after it... maybe I'm misunderstanding the first-child selector
[06:02:16] <Dragooon> What are you trying to do?
[06:02:59] <Dragooon> And does the parent element of the table have .view class or more than one element do?
[06:03:05] <naught101> Dragooon: Sorry, the code is at http://drupalcode.org/sandbox/naught101/2031569.git/blob/9ec0f152d924f7cf6ef193d422ef9891d759af5a:/views_flipped_table_accordion.js
[06:03:20] <Dragooon> HTML on which it's running?
[06:04:15] <naught101> Dragooon: Sorry, I don't have any publically accessible ATM. I'm trying to hide all non-.accordion rows initially, show the first row (which is a header), then accordion open and close the hidden rows when the .accordion rows above them are clicked
[06:04:29] <naught101> the showing/hiding works well, it just doesn't initialise properly
[06:04:34] <Dragooon> Can you just copy/paste the source code on a paste bin?
[06:04:45] <naught101> Yep, one sec
[06:06:40] <naught101> Dragooon: http://pastebin.ca/2412773
[06:07:11] <Dragooon> That thing has more classes than CSS
[06:07:11] <naught101> Sorry, it's quite large :/
[06:07:42] <naught101> Dragooon: I know, it's a rip from drupal. lots of unused classes. just ignore everything other than .accordion
[06:08:41] <Dragooon> Just use .view tr:first
[06:10:30] <naught101> Dragooon: same behaviour
[06:10:47] <Pal> Hi Good evening to every one
[06:10:52] <naught101> Dragooon: is it possible that the show/hide function is being triggered without clicking somehow?
[06:11:20] <Dragooon> lol, yeah. It's triggering it right there
[06:11:25] <Dragooon> See the trigger('click')
[06:11:57] <Dragooon> Line 9
[06:11:59] <naught101> Dragooon: ok. Ijust copied this from elsewhere :? just remove it? also, what's the .eq(0) for?
[06:12:02] <Pal> I have a html string which contains js (<script>) and css (<link>).....Here i wanna find and remove those thing
[06:12:07] <Pal> Is there any way
[06:12:12] <Pal> ???
[06:12:19] <Dragooon> naught101: eq(0) will return the first element of the matched set in the selector
[06:12:47] <Dragooon> Pal: How are you getting that HTML string? AJAX?
[06:13:04] <naught101> Dragooon: ha. ok, so remove that too.
[06:13:14] <Dragooon> naught101: Yeah it's useless
[06:13:19] <Dragooon> after you remove the trigger
[06:13:22] <naught101> Dragooon: work perfectly! Thanks heaps!
[06:13:23] <Pal> @Dragooon ...Yes via ajax only am getting
[06:14:14] <Dragooon> Pal: Hm, $(str).find('script').remove();
[06:14:32] <Pal> @Dragooon ...Yeap Tried ...but not working
[06:14:39] <Dragooon> I'm not sure if jQuery can take entire DOM in like that
[06:16:06] <Dragooon> Pal: Is it full html DOM?
[06:18:04] <Pal> @Dragooon ...hey my string like var string = "<!doctype><html><head><script type="text/javascript" src=""></script></head><body>Some Data'</body></html>"...From here how i do??
[06:19:25] <Dragooon> I'm not really sure how to remove it without running the script tag
[06:20:12] <Pal> @Dragooon ..Yeap...I dont wanna to load the scripts....
[06:20:24] <Pal> @Dragooon ..Anyway thanks buddy
[06:21:30] <Dragooon> Oh, apparently jQuery automatically removes script tags when using $(string), so you're work is already being done by jQ
[06:21:45] <Dragooon> You can simply do $(string).remove('link')
[06:21:48] <Dragooon> And it'll be fine
[06:21:50] <Dragooon> Pal ^
[06:23:27] <Pal> @Dragooon ..Yeap...Tried but not working
[06:23:47] <Pal> You many try in FF console
[06:24:04] <Pal> If any good thing please let me know
[06:26:43] <slax0r> Hi, is there perhaps any known issue/conflict with jquery hoverIntent and jquery markItUp on the same page?
[06:41:37] <pYr0x> hi guys... since toggle() is removed, how is the bast practice for toggle animation ... i will animate between "bottom: -130px" and "bottom: 0px"
[06:41:47] <pYr0x> since
[06:58:02] <Gorkyman> no time picker in date picker widgett? :/
[07:46:23] <Whirl3d> In writing my jquery plugin, I want to distinguish when a method returns a chainable jquery object and when it doesn't. Any suggestions?
[07:49:51] <Whirl3d> Although it sounds a bit Hungarian, I was considering adding the phrase "getVal" to methods that return non-chainables. Is this bad form and why?
[07:52:29] <Whirl3d> And then last question: is there a "catchall" method in jquery that is called when a method is undefined and/or how would I look that up?
[07:53:55] <systemfault> I'd be surprised if it had as the language itself doesn't support that.
[07:54:16] <systemfault> ES6 is going to have it with proxies
[07:57:11] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply systemfault. I thought for sure there was a way to define a handler for undefined method calls to jquery.
[07:59:26] <Whirl3d> wow, just looking through the deprecated 1.8 api and I noticed that .load, .unload, and .error are gone. What is the new way to handle these events?
[08:04:34] <systemfault> .on :P
[08:05:20] <systemfault> They have no reason to exist
[08:05:54] <Whirl3d> I could have figured that out. I am glad to see this trend in jquery.
[08:05:58] <Whirl3d> thanks
[08:08:45] <Whirl3d> in the api documentation it would be nice to color the deprecated methods red or purple or something to indicate that they should be avoided if possible.
[08:14:17] <Whirl3d> I think it would also be nice if the prefixed dimension properties were suffixed instead. In otherwords: innerHeight would becoe heightInner and outerHeight would become heightOuter, etc.
[08:16:30] <Coin-coin> Hi guys
[08:16:43] <Whirl3d> Can you use the '.' in a method name? In other words, because .height() returns a numeric value, you can't currently do .height().inner() but perhaps you could do .height.inner() ?
[08:16:53] <Whirl3d> hi Coin-coin.
[08:17:45] <Coin-coin> Do you know how I can  return the height css property of an element? Not its actual height, but its css property ("auto" should return "auto", not a numeric value of its current height) ?
[08:20:46] <Whirl3d> ? .css
[08:22:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/qCDkb/258/
[08:22:54] <Whirl3d> aha...I see what you mean.
[08:23:02] <Coin-coin> :p
[08:23:04] <Coin-coin> Yes
[08:23:10] <Coin-coin> It always return the computed height
[08:25:45] <Whirl3d> you can use .attr("style") and use regex to get the height style property
[08:26:12] <Coin-coin> No easier way? I'm kinda noof at programming
[08:26:14] <Coin-coin> noob
[08:29:46] <_rgn> maybe $el[0].style.height
[08:32:27] <Coin-coin> Not working too
[08:32:47] <Coin-coin> It seems that we can't access to the original values before computing
[08:32:59] <Coin-coin> Except if we parse the css document or something like that
[08:33:03] <Coin-coin> Thanks for your help
[08:36:08] <naquad> hi
[08:36:39] <naquad> point me to printf implementation in javascript compatible with jquery? the one in old plugin repo can't be donwnloaded (404)
[08:38:56] <_rgn> Coin-coin: i tried it and it seemed to work, maybe just on chrome though who knows
[08:39:21] <_rgn> Coin-coin: http://jsfiddle.net/qCDkb/263/
[08:39:22] <Coin-coin> Ah, maybe
[08:39:29] <Coin-coin> I heard it was a firefox issue
[08:44:07] <Whirl3d> naquad, jquery is javascript
[08:44:31] <naquad> Whirl3d, thank you captain obvious! o/
[08:44:53] <Whirl3d> might be compatible then
[08:45:19] <_rgn> if printf implementation wasn't jquery agnostic i'd be worried
[08:45:52] <Whirl3d> lol, i thought f in printf was a typo
[08:45:55] <Whirl3d> f
[08:46:51] <Whirl3d> I thought you were looking for a compatibility chart to print out or something.. LOL
[09:07:27] <abjorn> :o
[09:29:14] <AWarrad> hi
[09:29:20] <Dragooon> HELLO!
[09:59:17] <lordcaos> ?
[10:01:06] <defk0n> Hey, I have a problem. Is it possible to override the inline styling of a ajax requested html document?
[10:01:19] <defk0n> with jquery and if so how would i do that?
[10:04:39] <defk0n> my ajax request http://pastebin.com/d9GsZSMf
[10:09:46] <shoky> defk0n: it's possible somewhat. what does the html look like and what do you wanna do to it
[10:10:10] <shoky> defk0n: btw you have:   .find('div[id="main"')   which is wrong
[10:10:42] <Skullclown> euhm, kind of off-topic, but what is this called again? STATUS { DEFAULT, TEMP }, usage: STATUS.DEFAULT, STATUS.TEMP. I know how to use it, I just forgot the name ):
[10:10:52] <shoky> defk0n: also doing that css change is only affecting your "tree" var, it doesn't change xhr.responseText one bit
[10:11:21] <defk0n> shoky how do i save the changes to tree?
[10:11:38] <defk0n> redeclare like var tree = tree.find('div[id="main"').css("backgroundColor", "transparent");
[10:11:50] <shoky> defk0n:  .append( tree.contents() )  instead of .append( xhr.responseText )
[10:12:26] <shoky> defk0n:  .find('div[id="main"')   is wrong
[10:13:15] <defk0n> whats wrong about it? sorry am not really good at javascript
[10:13:19] <shoky> Skullclown:  enum?  that doesn't look like js
[10:13:33] <Skullclown> shoky: enum, yes. thanks. :)
[10:14:00] <shoky> defk0n: it's missing a closing ]   and anyway it's better to just  .find('div#main')
[10:14:09] <shoky> assuming your IDs are unique as they should be
[10:15:53] <defk0n> awww yeaaa its working
[10:16:00] <defk0n> shoky <3
[10:18:21] <naquad> can i somehow delegate draggable event? i have a grid which has dynamically added/removed items so i don't want to call draggable() every time new element appears
[10:27:59] <defk0n> how does one use jquery to find a specific selector, like example css: .filter-list ul.sub li a ,  or xpath?
[10:30:57] <Kambfhase> $('.filter-list ul.sub li a')
[10:31:27] <Kambfhase> jquery does not support xpath since the dark ages.
[10:37:54] <crab> is the jquery form plugin (jquery.malsup.com/form) still recommended/widely used? are there any better alternatives that have come up more recently?
[10:39:47] <CWSpear> What it accomplishesâ€¦ doesn't that only take like 5 lines of code to do on your own?
[10:40:36] <defk0n> Kambfhase does that work with find() also?
[10:41:04] <CWSpear> crab, I've never used it, but it looks like it's still being relatively actively worked on: https://github.com/malsup/form/
[10:41:27] <CWSpear> So I don't know about alternatives (I usually just do it by hand), but it is current and up to date
[10:41:36] <boytoy> crab: maybe jquery mobile?
[10:44:10] <Kambfhase> defk0n: yes, certainly
[10:45:00] <boytoy> At this click-to-expand kitty slider at http://jsbin.com/evehis/1/edit -- how do I get "height" inside SlidesJS to use my new customHeight variable?
[10:45:04] <boytoy> I need each slide to have a custom height. http://slidesjs.com used to have an autoHeight feature, but not anymore, maybe because setting custom height in principle is very easy?
[10:45:20] <crab> boytoy: afaics, jquery mobile is completely unrelated.
[10:46:51] <boytoy> crab: ah right my bad. maybe https://github.com/meltingice/ajax-chosen ?
[10:57:53] <defk0n> how does one use detach() to remove a html element? my code: var tree = $("<div>" + xhr.responseText + "</div>");    var heading =  tree.find('div.heading').html().detach();
[10:59:01] <Kambfhase> defk0n: var heading =  tree.find('div.heading').detach();
[10:59:29] <Kambfhase> no need for an extra .html() there
[10:59:52] <defk0n> thanks
[11:00:07] <Kambfhase> np
[11:00:09] <defk0n> jquery is weird
[11:00:10] <defk0n> lol
[11:00:13] <defk0n> or i am...
[11:00:26] <defk0n> alot of magic going around
[11:00:32] <defk0n> if you know what i mean
[11:00:40] <Kambfhase> yeah, jQuery is magic.
[11:01:15] <Kambfhase> But getting the hang of jQuery is easy. Just keep trying :)
[11:01:47] <defk0n> yer it is fun indeed
[11:04:06] <Whirl3d> I thought jquery was javascript. Now you are telling me it IS magic! I swear!
[11:04:10] <Whirl3d> lol
[11:04:39] <Kambfhase> You are getting it all wrong.
[11:04:48] <Kambfhase> JavaScript is implemented in jQuery.
[11:07:02] <dabear> isn't css a superset of javascript too, Kambfhase?
[11:07:07] <dabear> :p
[11:07:37] <Kambfhase> no, css is just a big pile of shit.
[11:08:54] <Kambfhase> If CSS was a super set of JS that would mean it would be turing complete, which it is not.
[11:10:54] <ylandsman> Can anyone tell me how to get IE9 to accept json correctly?  Right now it prompts me to open or save it
[11:11:26] <Kambfhase> you are loading it wrong, i guess
[11:12:13] <ylandsman> it works on all browsers but IE9
[11:12:16] <ylandsman> :(
[11:17:07] <ylandsman> anyone here have any experience using JSON with ie9?
[11:20:46] <defk0n> i think you need to have a json header if sending it from the server side
[11:21:36] <ylandsman> I have a json header, but IE keeps wanting to open or save rather than passing the JSON to my script
[11:21:42] <defk0n> header('Content-type: application/json'); if php
[11:21:56] <ylandsman> I have exactly that
[11:21:58] <defk0n> oh wait what? passing it to your javascript?
[11:22:14] <ylandsman> it doesn't pass anything to my script
[11:22:36] <ylandsman> works with all other browsers though
[11:23:35] <defk0n> your javascript? what script are you passing it to?
[11:26:07] <ylandsman> Its a script I wrote in javascript
[11:26:51] <ylandsman> the script get's nothing passed to it since ie9 wants to download the response instead of passing it on

[11:40:16] <jonathanvangils> Hello?
[11:40:31] <jonathanvangils> I need some help installing a Soundcloud stratus player to my tumblr can someone assist me?
[11:41:09] <relix> hey guys, I'm dynamically creating a div using jquery, and I need to get the width/height of the div before I display it
[11:41:13] <relix> is this possible?
[11:41:16] <Kambfhase> nope
[11:41:38] <jonathanvangils> can somebody plz just tell me the steps i need to take to install jquery on Mac
[11:41:45] <Kambfhase> or atleast not before you make your div non-hidden.
[11:41:48] <jonathanvangils> so the code provided for this soundcloud player will work
[11:41:59] <relix> Kambfhase but I guess I could position it outside the screen
[11:42:04] <relix> then check width/height
[11:42:10] <relix> probably the least-hacky solution
[11:42:36] <relix> jonathanvangils you don't install jquery on your mac, it's a file that the HTML page accesses, just like any other image or stylesheet
[11:42:37] <jonathanvangils> I will pay pal 5 dollars to someone who can walk me through installing this soundcloud widget
[11:43:02] <jonathanvangils> Thankyou Relix, how do I install this code: http://stratus.sc/guides#tumblr to my tumblr
[11:43:14] <jonathanvangils> i have tried copy and pasting the code in the right areas but it does not show up
[11:43:38] <jonathanvangils> The website also says, "Installing Stratus is easy. All you need to do is add some code to the <head> section of your HTML.
[11:43:39] <jonathanvangils> First, make sure you have jQuery installed. Once you've done that you're ready for the next step."
[11:44:20] <relix> jonathanvangils heh that's a stupid page
[11:44:24] <relix> jonathanvangils you have to add this as well:
[11:44:26] <relix> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[11:44:36] <relix> put that before the other code that you have to add
[11:44:54] <jonathanvangils> Relix, you're really helping me out man thankyou. So that page is wrong, That code will allow the tumblr theme to access jquery and embed the player?
[11:45:14] <jonathanvangils> i am a n00b
[11:45:14] <relix> jonathanvangils I don't know anything about tumblr or soundcloud, but yeah that code adds jquery to your page
[11:45:42] <jonathanvangils> trying it out bro
[11:46:09] <jonathanvangils> should i still paste the codes within <head> and before </body>
[11:46:25] <relix> yep
[11:46:57] <jonathanvangils> does this look right : <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js">
[11:46:58] <jonathanvangils> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://stratus.sc/stratus.js"></script>
[11:46:58] <jonathanvangils> <script type="text/javascript">
[11:46:58] <jonathanvangils>   $(document).ready(function(){
[11:46:59] <jonathanvangils>     $stratus({
[11:46:59] <jonathanvangils>       links: 'http://soundcloud.com/foofighters/sets/wasting-light'
[11:46:59] <jonathanvangils>     });
[11:47:00] <jonathanvangils>   });
[11:47:00] <jonathanvangils> </script>
[11:47:00] <jonathanvangils> </body>
[11:47:00] <jonathanvangils> </html>
[11:47:04] <jonathanvangils> Damnit, did not mean to do that
[11:47:06] <jonathanvangils> let me take a screen cap
[11:47:42] <relix> jonathanvangils use http://pastie.org
[11:47:44] <Kambfhase> OMFG
[11:48:03] <jonathanvangils> sorry about that

[11:48:23] <ylandsman> still looking for help with json and ie9
[11:48:39] <relix> jonathanvangils that could work, but you should find the </head> tag and place that code right before it
[11:48:51] <jonathanvangils> thanks
[11:49:08] <relix> other then that, that's perfectly according to the instructions
[11:49:15] <jonathanvangils> after "custum css"
[11:49:18] <jonathanvangils> custom Css*
[11:49:20] <relix> jonathanvangils yep, sure
[11:49:41] <jonathanvangils> before or after </style> they already have their own </style> tag im guessing i should just delete that
[11:50:02] <relix> style is something different, you shouldn't touch that
[11:50:08] <relix> put it just before </head>
[11:50:34] <relix> just find that tag, place your cursor before the "<" and paste the code
[11:50:41] <relix> that'll make sure everything is in the right place
[11:51:30] <jonathanvangils> oooh ok paste it inside <   PASTE / head > ?
[11:51:39] <jonathanvangils> before it
[11:53:50] <jonathanvangils> yeah im not sure what i'm doing wrong
[11:54:45] <relix> before it jonathanvangils, not inside it
[11:54:46] <jonathanvangils> relix Can i send you the code and you can tell me where to place it?
[11:55:10] <relix> jonathanvangils yeah sure, use pastie, I'll add it
[11:56:00] <jonathanvangils> thanks man. its a simple tumblr theme
[11:56:01] <jonathanvangils> http://pastie.org/8097575
[11:56:30] <relix> jonathanvangils ah see, line 167, jquery is already being loaded on your theme
[11:56:36] <relix> so you don't have to add it anymore
[11:57:02] <jonathanvangils> is there another reason the embedded player isn't showing up that I'm missing?
[11:57:04] <jonathanvangils> Thanks, btw
[11:58:08] <relix> jonathanvangils http://pastie.org/8097581
[11:58:19] <relix> ^ I added the embedded player here
[11:58:30] <relix> checkout line 195 to see how I did it
[11:58:47] <relix> if that's not working, then I don't know anymore :)
[11:58:54] <relix> you should ask the people from soundcloud
[11:59:39] <jonathanvangils> Thanks for the help man
[12:02:19] <relix> jonathanvangils no progs
[12:02:21] <relix> probs*
[12:02:48] <boytoy> join #soundcloud
[12:44:20] <lindii_> Total item $ seems to move if i do not have the same number of digits in this example.. the only way to fix this is using tables? http://jsfiddle.net/R2teD/
[12:47:28] <bmatusiak> anybody having problem with sortable?
[12:54:14] <bmatusiak> i found a bug that totally kills the ease of use on ui sortable plugin
[13:14:26] <phrearch> hei
[13:14:27] <phrearch> hey
[13:14:48] <phrearch> somehow this event is fired even if the button with id newRoom has a disabled class. any idea why? $('#newRoom:not(.disabled)').on('click', function(e) {
[13:27:35] <shoky> phrearch: that line sets an event handler on the button it found when you ran that line. it doesnt later care if it has the class or not
[13:28:38] <shoky> phrearch: you can either use event delegation instead, or do somth like:   if ( $(this).hasClass('disabled') ) { return; }
[13:37:30] <ylandsman> has anyone had any success getting JSON to work with ie9?
[13:38:28] <shoky> ylandsman: sure. what's the problem
[13:39:07] <ylandsman> I can't figure out the correct headers to get IE9 to not prompt to download the response
[13:40:29] <ylandsman> shoky: I can't figure out the correct headers to get IE9 to not prompt to download the response
[13:42:25] <shoky> ylandsman: what are you doing exactly
[13:43:57] <ylandsman> shoky: I have a script that submits a request via xmlhttpsubmit, and my php returns json with a content type of application/json.  In all browsers other than ie the response is sent to my script but on ie it prompts me to open or save the response
[13:45:13] <bmatusiak> sortable wont let me sort without moving element in its parent to empty div
[13:45:42] <Bheam> yo
[13:46:19] <Bheam> why'd they remove browser detection code in favor of "supports" ? There are several quirks that can't be detected by simply checking for existing functions/objects
[13:46:49] <shoky> ylandsman: xmlhttpsubmit?  paste your code on jsbin.com or somewhere
[13:48:19] <bmatusiak> sortable wont let me sort without moving element in its parent to empty div
[13:49:51] <beshoo> Hey,
[13:49:58] <beshoo> I am developing an app with multi-page template, i have same header and footer in almost all the pages.
[13:50:04] <beshoo> Now when i load a new page, the entire page slides along with header and footer.
[13:50:18] <beshoo> What i want is whenever a page loads only the content area div (data-role="content") of the page should change/slide, and not the header or footer div. is this possible and how.
[13:50:26] <defk0n> how does one select custom elements? like forexample filter in < div id="foo" filter="bar"></div>
[13:50:37] <beshoo> please advice ?
[13:51:07] <beshoo> iam talking about JQM
[13:51:12] <beshoo> jQuery Mobile
[13:58:35] <beshoo> in general i am looking for a wrapper page with global header and footer. Instead of content-section i think i need a pageContainer, which can hold my swiped in pages. Swiped in pages come without header/footer.
[13:58:38] <beshoo> but how ?
[14:05:02] <bmatusiak> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17394837/sort-able-broken-on-sorting-empty-div-elements
[14:08:42] <defk0n> how does one select custom elements? like forexample filter in < div id="foo" filter="bar"></div>  maybe $("<div filter>") ?
[14:08:44] <shoky> defk0n: $('#foo')
[14:09:20] <defk0n> yer icant select foo because its part of a navigation, classes and ids are  taken
[14:09:34] <shoky> why did you put it in there then..
[14:09:36] <bmatusiak> defk0n: $('div[filter="bar"]')
[14:09:49] <beshoo> the full story :: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6258866/persistent-header-in-jquery-mobile
[14:09:57] <defk0n> $('div[filter="*"]') would work aye?
[14:10:09] <shoky> it'd be much more inefficient
[14:10:15] <shoky> $('div[filter]')
[14:10:17] <bmatusiak> $('div[filter]')
[14:10:35] <defk0n> yer i know. iam using a bootstrap template so its not me creating it like that
[14:10:44] <shoky> that'd look through each div in the page
[14:10:45] <defk0n> just need to add a custom selector to browse over through
[14:11:07] <defk0n> thanks bmatusiak shoky
[14:11:14] <bmatusiak> :P
[14:11:40] <defk0n> shout out to mah nigz :P
[14:11:44] <defk0n> lol
[14:11:47] <bmatusiak> defk0n: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[14:12:21] <jwzx24> I want to do a hover on an image that changes the img's src attribute... easy enough... but I want it to restore the original src attrib on mouseout -- can this be done?
[14:12:33] <bmatusiak> ye
[14:12:34] <bmatusiak> s
[14:12:37] <jwzx24> I can't seem to find a way to store the original src in a way that the mouseout part of hover() can access
[14:12:50] <shoky> ?data
[14:13:06] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/data
[14:13:07] <bmatusiak> var oldSrc = $("img").attr("src");
[14:13:11] <NetTalk> i dont know why doesnt it way of replacing or passing the a href url woudnt seem work ? 	
[14:13:11] <NetTalk> $('#sucess_'+actionusId > a).replaceWith ( rponse );
[14:13:26] <NetTalk> where #sucess_'+actionusId is div id
[14:13:41] <NetTalk> and under this div.. i have a href=""
[14:13:48] <shoky> NetTalk:  the > a  is outside of the string..
[14:14:10] <jwzx24> bmatusiak: I've tried that, but the 2nd part of the hover function has no idea what oldSrc is when invoked
[14:14:12] <shoky> that'd prolly match  #sucess_false
[14:14:35] <NetTalk> it matchs
[14:14:57] <jwzx24> but this data() thing looks super handy
[14:15:07] <NetTalk> when i insert or update a new value for this div.
[14:15:25] <shoky> NetTalk:  $('#sucess_'+actionusId > a)    the > a is outside of the string
[14:15:41] <shoky> you probably meant  $('#sucess_'+actionusId + ' > a')
[14:15:51] <NetTalk> oh yes..
[14:15:57] <NetTalk> you are right let me try now
[14:17:37] <NetTalk> <shoky> can you see.. <div id="sucess_<?php echo $request->idActuacion; ?>" ><a href="#"  download="gsh_file_download" target="_blank"><img src="/public/img/download.png" style="cursor:pointer;"/></a></div>
[14:18:03] <NetTalk> here is a href under this div sucess_<?php echo $request->idActuacion; ?>
[14:18:04] <shoky> NetTalk: that's a bad way of doing it
[14:18:13] <NetTalk> ohh :(
[14:18:21] <shoky> NetTalk:  use a class instead, and a data-id attribute for that id
[14:18:21] <NetTalk> so what should i do
[14:18:25] <NetTalk> nope..
[14:18:51] <NetTalk> wait.. i hvae a table..which has more than 100 records..
[14:18:58] <NetTalk> so each row should be unique..
[14:19:08] <shoky> like.. <div class="success" data-id="idActuacion_here">...    $('.success[data-id="' + actionusId + '"]')
[14:19:25] <shoky> the row is still unique. IDs should not be used like that
[14:19:35] <NetTalk> ok..
[14:19:37] <shoky> unless there is a good reason, which you dont seem to have
[14:20:05] <shoky> but anyway, you didn't say what the problem is
[14:20:23] <shoky> and if you still have one, make a demo on jsfiddle.net
[14:20:45] <NetTalk> and what about changing n passing the url value to a href=""
[14:21:04] <NetTalk> $('.success[data-id="' + actionusId + '"] > a')
[14:21:17] <shoky> what about it?
[14:21:25] <shoky> or.. what do you mean
[14:21:48] <NetTalk> wait.. let me show u what i do ..
[14:21:49] <bmatusiak> jwzx24: you need give the img a attr of "oldSrc"
[14:22:22] <shoky> not really
[14:23:02] <bmatusiak> jwzx24: like  $("img").attr("oldSrc",$("img").attr("src"));
[14:23:25] <shoky> bmatusiak: using .data() is better, i think he's set
[14:24:16] <NetTalk> http://jsfiddle.net/Re2ej/
[14:24:20] <bmatusiak> shoky: true..
[14:24:43] <NetTalk> i m doing ajax past
[14:24:46] <NetTalk> post*
[14:25:10] <shoky> NetTalk: no php please. not so much code please - only what's relevant to solve your issue. and say what the issue is, too
[14:25:41] <bmatusiak> shoky: you ever use the sortable ui?
[14:25:59] <shoky> bmatusiak: yeah
[14:26:07] <NetTalk> nope..
[14:26:18] <shoky> bmatusiak: if you make a jsfiddle demo of your issue i can try to help
[14:26:25] <bmatusiak> shoky:  i have i wierd problem if you want to take a gander at it
[14:26:34] <microcode> http://magnifi.ca/photos/concept/reap-oh/ << I'm trying to get jQuery to resize the map to fill the rest of the bottom of the screen on load(init code for that is in the head), and the various sane ways to bind it don't appear to be working
[14:26:46] <microcode> I have verified that the resizeMap function indeed works when called later
[14:27:00] <microcode> but does not when the events are fired, either wrapped on not
[14:27:53] <bmatusiak> shoky: i use cloud9 instead if you dont mind lookin at it in cloud9
[14:28:00] <shoky> microcode:  $(window).resize(resizeMap());   that calls resizeMap
[14:28:05] <shoky> microcode:  lose the ()
[14:28:12] <microcode> oh right
[14:28:12] <microcode> derp
[14:28:14] <microcode> forgot my scheme habits
[14:28:15] <shoky> microcode: same for the other one
[14:28:19] <microcode> thanks
[14:28:51] <shoky> bmatusiak: it's fine, as long as it's a minimal testcase that demos your problem
[14:28:56] <microcode> referring to the symbol, not its return value
[14:29:21] <bmatusiak> shoky: http://bmatusiak_us.bmatusiak.c9.io/
[14:29:53] <shoky> bmatusiak: heh wtf is that
[14:29:56] <NetTalk> <shoky> can you see now...i removed php script and just showing rendering one.. http://jsfiddle.net/Re2ej/1/ how to change the a href url ???
[14:30:12] <bmatusiak> shoky: o the background is node.js log being compiled
[14:30:18] <microcode> shoky: still broken though, unfortunately
[14:30:45] <bmatusiak> shoky: on the page at the bottom if you click elements provided.. you see some bootstrap well div elements
[14:31:49] <microcode> nvm shoky, all fixed
[14:32:47] <NetTalk> sorry.. there was an error..
[14:32:49] <NetTalk> now u can see
[14:32:50] <NetTalk> http://jsfiddle.net/Re2ej/2/
[14:33:07] <NetTalk> here is what i m trying to change the URL..
[14:33:20] <shoky> NetTalk: you still have  $('#sucess_'+actionusId > a)
[14:33:27] <shoky> and you can change the href  with .attr()
[14:34:09] <bmatusiak> shoudnt it be      $('#sucess_'+actionusId+' > a')    ?
[14:34:35] <shoky> bmatusiak: what's the problem in your page?  and can you make a more minimal testcase without all that junk
[14:35:01] <bmatusiak> shoky: yes it may take me a few
[14:38:45] <NetTalk> <shoky> i can also use this ....  $('#sucess_'+hotelId > a).prop('href', rponse ); ???
[14:39:24] <shoky> NetTalk: it's safer to use .attr  for the 'href' specifically, i think. but .prop might work for it too.
[14:39:50] <shoky> NetTalk: and not with that selector, again..
[14:43:33] <bmatusiak> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/UChtJ/
[14:44:41] <bmatusiak> use this one instead   http://jsfiddle.net/UChtJ/1/
[14:47:25] <shoky> bmatusiak: ok im looking
[14:48:31] <bmatusiak> shoky: the problem is i have to move the provided elements in the parent before i can move it to "sections" of the page
[14:49:48] <bmatusiak> im pretty sure its a bug in sortable but i just want to make sure
[14:50:43] <bmatusiak> shoky: brb i need to get some coffie
[14:53:55] <AWarrad> hi
[15:05:05] <chee> boobs
[15:05:07] <chee> oops
[15:19:03] <shoky> bmatusiak: donno how to deal with that weird bootstrap css. it seems that mostly the issue is that the sections don't have a big enough size before you add that highlight class to them
[15:27:36] <bmatusiak> shoky: cant i update the sortable ui to recheck it?
[15:46:45] <ldexterldesign> hey, anyone got any advice on server-side vs client-side "save as..." file downloading?
[15:46:54] <ldexterldesign> is this the best solution http://johnculviner.com/jquery-file-download-plugin-for-ajax-like-feature-rich-file-downloads/ ?
[15:48:29] <beshoo> HI .i have a problem when transitions between pages (blinking / flicker) i tride all things but still flicker
[15:48:35] <beshoo> what should i do
[15:48:47] <beshoo> JQM
[15:49:54] <beshoo> any idea ?
[15:55:17] <shoky> bmatusiak: mm maybe
[15:56:11] <shoky> bmatusiak:  $(this).data('ui-sortable').refreshPositions();   seems to make it better, i think
[15:56:37] <shoky> bmatusiak: http://jsfiddle.net/UChtJ/6/
[16:02:18] <shoky> ldexterldesign: what do you mean by client-side save-as.. ?
[16:02:43] <shoky> ldexterldesign: that plugin seems to just create an iframe pointing to a server-side download link
[16:03:08] <ldexterldesign> shoky:i have 2 anchors on my page
[16:03:32] <ldexterldesign> shoky:they both link to a .pdf file, but i want to separate behaviours
[16:03:45] <ldexterldesign> shoky:one is a view in browser (nothing complex)
[16:03:54] <ldexterldesign> shoky:the other is a forced download link
[16:04:33] <shoky> ldexterldesign: oks, it's the server-side response headers that determine what the browser will try to do, usually
[16:04:34] <ldexterldesign> shoky:it appears you can do it with php http://php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php but i wondered how you'd do it?
[16:04:58] <shoky> ldexterldesign:  example header for download:   Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=Report0.pdf
[16:05:18] <shoky> if you have a php question go to ##php
[16:05:21] <ldexterldesign> shoky:have you used this before?
[16:05:29] <shoky> that header? sure
[16:05:45] <ldexterldesign> shoky:#php or ##php?
[16:05:46] <shoky> the plugin's demo page is using the same thing
[16:05:54] <ldexterldesign> shoky:#php is invite only
[16:05:54] <shoky> i took that header from the plugin's demo
[16:06:06] <shoky> ldexterldesign:  you need to register your nickname.  /msg nickserv help register
[16:07:30] <ldexterldesign> shoky:where do i type that?
[16:07:42] <shoky> ldexterldesign: anywhere. here

[16:25:02] <shoky> ldexterldesign: what did nickserv say?
[16:25:23] <shoky> ldexterldesign: i think you need to confirm the email
[16:25:54] <bmatusiak> shoky: thanks that fixd it
[16:25:58] <bmatusiak> thanks
[16:30:39] <ldexterldesign> shoky:he said nothing unfortunately?
[16:30:52] <ldexterldesign> shoky:what's the syntax again?
[16:31:00] <shoky> ldexterldesign: /msg nickserv help register
[16:31:23] <shoky> ldexterldesign:  he says:   -NickServ- You have to confirm the email address. To do this, follow the instructions in the message sent to the email address.
[16:31:57] <shoky> ldexterldesign:  that's not the command for registering.. only for getting help about how to register
[16:32:08] <ldexterldesign> shoky:i see no email in my mailbox?
[16:32:20] <shoky> ldexterldesign: did you register?
[16:32:36] <ldexterldesign> shoky:i think so, will try again
[16:32:56] <shoky> check yer spam folder too
[16:34:30] <ldexterldesign> shoky:done, thanks :)
[16:54:49] <mreq> Can I use Date.now() to namespace events? Resulting in something like 'resize.toolbar1372636468889'
[16:56:59] <shoky> have you tried?
[16:59:10] <mreq> Nope, want to make sure about cross-browser comp.
[16:59:27] <mreq> Couldn't find it in the docs
[17:00:33] <shoky> it's a regular simple string, no reason why it wouldn't work
[17:01:13] <mreq> ok, thanks
[17:01:19] <rmurphey> mreq: you could also just increment a counter
[17:01:30] <rmurphey> every time you do the binding
[17:02:14] <mreq> rmurphey: I am editing a third party plugin http://paulkinzett.github.io/toolbar/ which pollutes the memory as it doesn't unbind it's events and remove it's els.
[17:02:29] <tw2113> dastardly 3rd party plugins
[17:02:42] <shoky> mreq: it .remove()s them?
[17:02:43] <mreq> Am not 100% fluent in it's code, but trying to eliminiate possible damage to my backbone app
[17:02:51] <mreq> shoky: no, it does nothing :o
[17:03:05] <mreq> shoky: Am talking about window and document events
[17:03:10] <shoky> oh, your sentence was ambiguous
[17:03:14] <mreq> sorry about that
[17:03:48] <mreq> Am trying to namespace those and created a destroy method for it - eg. $(window).on "resize.toolbar#{self.uid}"
[17:03:55] <mreq> That's coffee btw
[17:06:06] <shoky> welp rmurphey's counter suggestion still stands
[17:06:33] <shoky> holds. whatever
[17:06:42] <rmurphey> also potentially easier to do the unbinding with a counter vs dates
[17:06:59] <tw2113> mr murphey
[18:41:40] <megalomix> hello
[18:42:04] <megalomix> guys, is it possible to detect when a class of a div changes ?
[18:42:10] <megalomix> is there an event for it ?
[18:50:00] <shoky> megalomix: nothing cross-browser
[18:50:45] <lenswipee> jquery is cross-browser
[18:50:54] <shoky> ..
[18:51:00] <megalomix> shoky, hmm so i need to use setinterval
[18:51:03] <HarryPitfall> megalomix: only if you use a timeout, comparing the old class with the new class
[18:51:08] <megalomix> and test it each N Milliseconds
[18:51:14] <HarryPitfall> exactly
[18:51:17] <megalomix> HarryPitfall, exactly
[18:51:25] <shoky> megalomix: that's an extreme, only if theres nothing better you can do
[18:51:38] <megalomix> shoky, yes i do not like it soo much
[18:51:43] <megalomix> but i think there is no other solution
[18:51:45] <shoky> megalomix: it's best to just track when you're making the change that matters to you
[18:51:45] <HarryPitfall> i dont like setInterval, most of time i use setTimeout, and queue again and again the same function
[18:52:16] <shoky> you could also trigger your own event each time you change the class
[18:52:21] <megalomix> shoky, i cant..i am using phantomjs
[18:52:25] <megalomix> with jquery
[18:52:32] <megalomix> i do not know when it happens
[18:52:45] <megalomix> HarryPitfall, yes settimeout
[18:52:47] <shoky> i dunno much about phantomjs sry
[18:53:30] <megalomix> shoky, the problem is that i do not know when it will be visible
[18:53:37] <megalomix> so i think there is only ONE solution
[18:54:02] <megalomix> calling a function N times until it detects
[18:54:04] <shoky> who's making the change, then
[18:54:21] <megalomix> shoky, the problem is... when i set a value inside an input text
[18:54:33] <megalomix> there are other js script that change the content of the page
[18:54:45] <megalomix> so i know when all is done WHEN this div sill be visible
[18:54:56] <shoky> and they don't have a way for you to hook into it? like providing a callback
[18:55:01] <megalomix> so i thought is better to "listen" it...when it will be visible i will do my operations
[18:55:17] <shoky> use better js scripts :S
[18:55:36] <megalomix> shoky, i do an example...
[18:55:44] <megalomix> if you see google.com
[18:55:50] <megalomix> when you start typing a word
[18:55:54] <megalomix> google change the content of the page
[18:56:02] <megalomix> so i need to fight with something like that
[18:56:22] <shoky> a site not under your control?
[18:56:28] <megalomix> exactly
[18:56:51] <shoky> does this need to be cross-browser somehow..
[18:57:29] <shoky> maybe phantomjs supports the non cross-browser events
[18:57:33] <shoky> whatever they're called
[18:57:58] <shoky> mmm DOM mutation observers or something
[18:58:16] <shoky> megalomix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[18:58:44] <megalomix> shoky, if you have to work ot it...something like GOogle search
[18:58:46] <Eviltwin> Ugh, those shouldn't be used
[18:58:50] <megalomix> how do you handle it ?
[18:59:20] <shoky> Eviltwin: how come?
[18:59:48] <megalomix> shoky, or wait....
[18:59:49] <shoky> megalomix: depends what exactly i wanna do..
[18:59:56] <Eviltwin> So easy to infinte loop when really you want a pubsub system or something
[19:00:01] <HarryPitfall> phantom is based on webkit...
[19:00:02] <Eviltwin> To listen for the thing that caused the mutation
[19:00:08] <megalomix> shoky, yes webkit
[19:00:08] <Eviltwin> Not the mutation itself
[19:00:20] <HarryPitfall> so, just look how webkit handle these things
[19:00:20] <megalomix> shoky, i need to send a form like google...
[19:00:28] <shoky> Eviltwin: but what if there's nothing else to listen for?
[19:00:35] <megalomix> i can not set the value inside the input and then does the submit()
[19:00:45] <megalomix> i have to wait until this div will be visible
[19:01:26] <Eviltwin> What I'm saying is it should truly be a last resort
[19:01:26] <megalomix> maybe i found another solution..... if i use submit() can i know if it iwll completly submitted
[19:01:30] <megalomix> if an error occurs
[19:01:40] <megalomix> how can i know it ?
[19:01:46] <shoky> Eviltwin: of course
[19:02:00] <Eviltwin> I'd argue that modifying library / plugin code should be higher up the list
[19:02:11] <shoky> if you have control over it
[19:02:15] <shoky> definitely
[19:04:10] <megalomix> shoky, now i do .submit()
[19:04:16] <megalomix> it returns something?
[19:04:17] <megalomix> i mean...
[19:04:24] <megalomix> something to understand if the form is sent correctly
[19:04:25] <megalomix> ?
[19:04:32] <megalomix> i know the ID of the form
[19:04:44] <shoky> megalomix: i donno, that's highly dependant on google's code
[19:04:49] <megalomix> so i can do .submit() .submit() untill it goes
[19:06:05] <megalomix> shoky, in another situation...when you do .submit() how can you know if there was a problem in the submit() ?
[19:06:17] <megalomix> how can you understand if the form is sent correctly ?
[19:06:38] <PhaseCode> Hi! I'm using the .sortable method, and I want to be able to sort a table except for one row is that possible?
[19:07:18] <Eviltwin> PhaseCode: Is it a header / footer?
[19:07:18] <PhaseCode> It also happens that its the last row in the table
[19:07:31] <PhaseCode> no its inside a tbody its just a row
[19:07:38] <shoky> megalomix: i donno man, "if there was a problem" is too general
[19:07:41] <Eviltwin> PhaseCode: Can you put it in a <tfoot>?
[19:07:54] <PhaseCode> I think I can actually let me see :)
[19:08:02] <Eviltwin> That might work
[19:08:07] <Eviltwin> Been a while since I've worked with sotrable
[19:08:08] <Eviltwin> sortable*
[19:09:39] <megalomix> shoky, there is no solution when i use .submit() to understand if an error is returned?
[19:10:18] <PhaseCode> Yup That worked :)
[19:10:30] <shoky> megalomix: again,  "an error is returned"  is too general.
[19:10:39] <shoky> megalomix: also  "i use .submit()"  is too general
[19:11:04] <megalomix> why too general? $('#myform').submit()
[19:11:06] <shoky> megalomix: make a testcase showing exactly what you wanna do and we can try to help
[19:11:08] <megalomix> i use it to send a form...
[19:11:28] <shoky> .submit()  could do anything from nothing to submitting a form, to sending an ajax request, to blowing up the pc
[19:11:34] <shoky> that's what i mean by too general
[19:12:13] <megalomix> ok
[19:13:42] <megalomix> i need to go......... 4:13 am here °_°
[19:13:46] <megalomix> thank you guys!!!!
[19:21:39] <PhaseCode> is there a drop function for .sortable?
[19:21:42] <w32stuxnet> hi all, is there a way to intercept arbitrary jquery callbacks using Chrome developer tools or something ismilar?
[19:22:06] <w32stuxnet> I.e. when I click a button somewhere, and it calls some jquery code, I want it to put a breakpoint there
[19:31:49] <_rgn> w32stuxnet: you can use developer tools to put breakpoints on click events
[19:38:29] <PhaseCode> is anyone in here have experience with css?
[19:39:04] <freebir> hey people
[20:03:43] <b1lly> hi
[20:05:10] <lenswipee> bye
[20:25:36] <lenswipee> hey, is this line of code valid? var $thisContact = $('#tab1').find('div.contacts').hasClass('opened: first');
[20:26:27] <b1lly> no
[20:26:29] <lenswipee> it should mean find first div.contacts that has class 'opened' in #tab1
[20:26:41] <shoky> opened: first  doesn't look like a class name
[20:26:52] <b1lly> hasClass('opened');
[20:26:55] <shoky> not even a selector
[20:27:05] <b1lly> also, that will return true or false
[20:27:06] <shoky> hasClass also returns a boolean
[20:27:09] <b1lly> it wont return the elemnt
[20:27:36] <shoky> .find('div.contacts.opened').first()  maybe..
[20:27:52] <lenswipee> ah that makes more sense
[20:27:54] <lenswipee> thanks shoky
[20:27:55] <shoky> or .find('div.contacts.opened:first')
[20:28:07] <lenswipee> even better
[20:28:43] <lenswipee> if it can't find one, what will it return?
[20:28:47] <lenswipee> an empty string?
[20:28:54] <shoky> empty jquery object
[20:29:00] <shoky> wiith .length === 0
[20:29:15] <lenswipee> what does an empty $ object look like?
[20:29:28] <shoky> what does a non empty one look like?
[20:29:43] <shoky> anyway i just told you the defining feature.. .length === 0
[20:29:45] <lenswipee> don't know
[20:29:57] <lenswipee> ok
[20:37:55] <Spork2013> Does anyone know of a preexisting script that does what this person is asking about? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8171024/slide-panel-up-after-x-seconds-close-on-click-set-cookie
[21:16:29] <SuperPhly> Hey folks, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how to about this ajax race condition I've sorta created. Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/gAU38K5b
[21:17:31] <SuperPhly> I need to wait for each of those ajax requests to finish before I do another task. I'm thinking that I'm really close to learning an important lesson with javascript
[21:19:37] <SuperPhly> is there a way to fire both of those requests off and then once they both return successfully, do something elseâ€¦ if one or both fail, then do something else.
[21:22:40] <bryanbuchanan> SuperPhly, I don't know if it's the best way to do it, but I've put one ajax request inside the success function of another
[21:23:08] <bryanbuchanan> that way it runs one at a time, then you can put your final callback function inside the success function of your 2nd ajax request
[21:23:24] <SuperPhly> bryanbuchanan: I'm looking at the $.when function
[21:23:40] <bryanbuchanan> Or, you could add "async: false" to the properties to freeze stuff until they're both done
[21:24:29] <bryanbuchanan> nice, that looks cleaner than my method :)
[21:30:09] <SuperPhly> after an ajax request, the variable i'm trying to return is coming back as this: [object Object],success,[object Object]
[21:38:30] <cknox> I think that means success?
[21:38:36] <cknox> Or does it mean object?
[21:38:45] <cknox> perhaps there was an objection to the success?
[21:39:44] <SuperPhly> well, from what the .ajax docs tell me, success returns 3 values in order: PlainObject data, String textStatus, jqXHR
[21:39:49] <SuperPhly> i just need the first one
[21:41:42] <Spork2013> How can I make this red tab say "MAILING LIST" in horizontal white text? Jquery question... how can I made the red tab say "MAILING LIST" in white, horizontally? http://jsfiddle.net/8jEtd/19/
[21:45:16] <lenswipee> hey, is .val() only used for form elements? I have an anchor <a>Some text</a> that i want to get
[21:46:41] <lenswipee> ?.val()
[21:46:42] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:46:45] <shoky> lenswipee: yes
[21:47:04] <lenswipee> yes that .val() should be used here?
[21:47:11] <shoky> yes to your question
[21:47:21] <shoky> you want .text() or .html()
[21:47:41] <lenswipee> which is faster?
[21:48:06] <shoky> both are fast enough. if you don't need html use .text()
[21:48:25] <lenswipee> ok
[22:07:37] <Parham> Hi. I have a jQuery code that sends a get request (using ~.get) to checkEmail. The checkEmail action does not redirect the user anywhere, but the browser (not only the get request) is redirected to the login page. Is there a way for me to trace the jQuery execution and see where this get request is being sent? I've tried using Firebug, but the buffer clears at redirection.
[22:07:53] <Parham> Err, that's $.get, not ~.get
[22:20:24] <SuperPhly> can i bind events to a nonexistent element only to have the events assume once they are created
[22:21:44] <gry> SuperPhly: .on() per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:22:32] <SuperPhly> oh nice, that essentially binds to the document with a sorta watcher
[22:24:38] <vinex08> guys help me on this ... http://jsfiddle.net/uw8Kz/2/   doesnt want to work
[22:26:38] <vinex08> anyone??

[23:25:57] <grafi> hello party people
[23:53:13] <titii> Hi there, when i plug a plugin like a $('#liquid').liquidcarousel(...; can i UNplug this somehow? Is it possible?
[23:55:16] <titii> I am asking because, i am pluging this extension many times, and I see the plugin is proceeding the same functionalities many times
[23:55:19] <innociv_> The plugin needs its own unbinder
[23:56:03] <titii> innociv_: this is simple plugin, how the unbind works?
[23:56:33] <innociv_> Ask the plugins docs
[23:58:04] <titii> innociv_: i mean, that is simple plugin, and i can do the unbinder, but how? can u offer some snippet?
[23:58:12] <titii> or nice example ? :
[23:58:40] <innociv_> You would need to make an unbinding function that undoes whatever it does.
[23:59:56] <titii> innociv_: ah, so forexample that plugin makes some click events, so that events needs to be unbind? Nothing more?
