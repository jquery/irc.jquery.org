[00:10:55] <Voyage> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/5171876 If I make line 52 async: false , only one request is sent (despite the for each loop of rowCount  which is 16 in number line 39). If I set async: true, it works 16 times
[00:15:26] <xec> Voyage: don't set async to false
[00:18:29] <Voyage> xec,   well, its mandatory in the senario, I want to preseerv the request/repsonse sequence. which is not possible in asyn: true
[00:20:07] <xec> Voyage: maybe queue them? try googling "jquery ajax queue"
[00:20:42] <xec> "async: true" basically means you block the entire browser
[00:23:39] <hnd> Hi, I have a fast question :) , About this jQuery plugin: http://www.meanthemes.com/plugins/meanmenu/ , how can I call this menu on window.onload to open ? :) jQuery code: http://pastebin.com/FwuVVnHF
[00:26:41] <hnd> Hi, I have a fast question :) , About this jQuery plugin: http://www.meanthemes.com/plugins/meanmenu/ , how can I call this menu on window.onload to open ? :) jQuery code: http://pastebin.com/FwuVVnHF
[00:26:56] <xec> hnd: we saw it the first time, no need to repeat the question
[00:27:07] <hnd> Sorry, didn't know :/
[00:27:13] <xec> hnd: what do you mean by "call this menu"?
[00:27:24] <hnd> I need the menu to slide open when you load the page
[00:27:40] <xec> hnd: either the plugin exposes a "open" method, or you can look through its source to figure out what makes it tick, or you could try to .trigger("click") on the element that opens it
[00:31:02] <Voyage> xec, $.ajax(url_1).done(function () { $.ajax(url_2).done(function () { $.ajax(url_3).done(…) } }
[00:31:40] <xec> that's not a queue, that's just successive callbacks. but sure, that would work too
[00:31:44] <Voyage> xec,  or any way to  can still wait to fire off #2 until the success callback of #1.
[00:32:01] <xec> did you try to google what i told you?
[00:32:17] <hnd> Me? yes :)
[00:32:22] <xec> no, Voyage
[00:32:23] <Voyage> yes. I want options
[01:03:59] <krambiorix> hi, when i move my draggable it hides. When i stop moving it, it shows up again... Does anyone know this kind of behaviour?
[01:24:31] <jphase> krambiorix: sounds like an issue with css, have you tried making a jsfiddle to see if the problem occurs with just your site?
[01:24:46] <brunoais> krambiorix, is that using jQuery UI?
[01:24:57] <brunoais> or is it using the DOM's dragging?
[01:25:10] <krambiorix> jphase, when i remove the background-color in css it works :s
[01:26:08] <brunoais> krambiorix, Is that for just the element being dragged?
[01:26:24] <brunoais> krambiorix, also, please answer my question
[01:26:49] <krambiorix> bruno: jquery ui yes
[01:27:01] <krambiorix> brunoais, the element being dragged yes
[01:27:27] <brunoais> krambiorix, Which is the CSS selector you are using?
[01:27:54] <krambiorix> brunoais, .invoiceitem
[01:28:15] <brunoais> Hum... so it is a class selector...
[01:29:22] <brunoais> krambiorix, use the browser's DOM inspector to see if any of your CSS is being overriden by any of jQuery UI's CSS (or any other)
[01:32:01] <krambiorix> brunoais, nope
[01:33:15] <brunoais> krambiorix, so you confirmed that there's no override?
[01:33:42] <krambiorix> brunoais, maybe the z-index
[01:34:03] <brunoais> krambiorix, just the z-index?
[01:34:17] <brunoais> to which value did it change to?
[01:34:36] <krambiorix> brunoais, and position -> relative
[01:34:52] <krambiorix> brunoais, z-index value : parent zindex value - 1
[01:35:41] <brunoais> krambiorix, are you using chrome?
[01:37:02] <krambiorix> brunoais, nope, Firefox
[01:38:04] <brunoais> krambiorix, so it goes from which position to relative?
[01:51:40] <krambiorix> brunoais, absolute -> relative (sry had a phone call)
[01:51:53] <brunoais> It's ok
[01:52:12] <krambiorix> brunoais, only in Firefox , in chrome it works...
[01:52:17] <brunoais> krambiorix, Hum... That's complicated
[01:52:29] <brunoais> are you able to make a jsfiddle out of that?
[01:52:42] <brunoais> Your situation has problematic details there
[02:03:18] <krambiorix> hmm brunoais i can't
[02:03:18] <krambiorix> brunoais, i located the problem
[02:03:18] <krambiorix> brunoais, the draggables are placed in a widget
[02:03:55] <brunoais> krambiorix, that's what I usually don't liek about libs :S
[02:04:04] <brunoais> We never really know what they are doing
[02:04:48] <krambiorix> brunoais, apparently it's the overflow-y : auto on the widget content
[02:05:26] <brunoais> krambiorix, I've been using the browser's API
[02:05:36] <brunoais> It has... weird stuff there
[02:05:50] <brunoais> the ppor guy who made that thing had to adjust to the current implementations
[02:06:11] <brunoais> but it works really well to avoid trouble
[02:06:21] <brunoais> troubles like that one you had there
[02:07:19] <brunoais> Unfortunately, the actual way of doing it is a bit confusing
[02:07:59] <brunoais> Maybe I'll make a lib to help using it... It might help...
[02:08:56] <krambiorix> brunoais, hmmm, i think it's my fault, i set the overflow-y
[02:09:04] <krambiorix> on the widget content
[02:10:00] <brunoais> krambiorix, to which value did you set it to?
[02:13:33] <krambiorix> brunoais, aut
[02:13:35] <krambiorix> *auto
[02:14:13] <brunoais> krambiorix, does the widget change sizes during the drag & drop operation?
[02:15:48] <krambiorix> brunoais, no
[02:16:59] * brunoais checking the drag & drop example on jQuery Ui website
[02:18:18] <krambiorix> brunoais, but it's ok, i set the overflow with jquery and now it works :s :)
[02:19:26] <brunoais> krambiorix, Eh... that's... weird
[02:19:32] <brunoais> but ok
[02:21:26] <krambiorix> it is
[03:11:49] <anli__> I have problems with button clicks, they are not always registered, I wonder if that is because the mouse has moved a pixel between down and up
[03:12:07] <anli__> http://jsfiddle.net/zNLNy/1231/
[03:12:15] <anli__> (kendo style)
[03:16:41] <brunoais> anli__, Eh...
[03:16:46] <brunoais> that's... not a button
[03:16:57] <anli__> Well, you are right
[03:18:16] <brunoais> anli__, where are you registering the event listeners?
[03:18:45] <anli__> kendoui does it for me, so I guess I need to find the code, well, it is maybe off topic in here
[03:19:04] <brunoais> Too hard for me
[03:19:17] <brunoais> I have no clue that kendoui is
[03:20:17] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. I am trying to check on the jquery ui tooltip how it is going to open, like if it is going for the fallback or original position. is it possible to check that in the open event?
[03:52:39] <joobie> guys, is there a way in firebug (or an alternative tool) to be able to see what JS is running ?
[03:52:56] <joobie> like when you hover for example, can you see what JS might be firing on the hover?
[04:05:47] <iKb> hi all
[04:06:12] <iKb> i can't acces $ in my function (i am just starting to work with jquery)
[04:06:14] <iKb> http://jsfiddle.net/rdZ7C/
[04:10:11] <cbuchler> Eh.
[04:29:08] <bberry> iKb: http://jsfiddle.net/rdZ7C/1/ theres some fixes
[04:29:25] <bberry> theres no such thing as alert.log, just alert and console.log
[04:29:47] <bberry> also, you seemed to have wrapped all that code in functions that weren't necessary, so i removed those
[04:30:30] <bberry> also, to concatenate strings, use the + operator
[04:31:54] <iKb> bberry, thanks
[04:31:59] <bberry> np :D
[04:35:21] <bberry> joobie: you can put in breakpoints in the debuggers. if you dont know where in the code the functions are, you can look up their event listeners (in chromes debugger, idk about others)
[04:37:08] <drakee> hello all, i have a FileReader which reads my images and than i also save that readed images src inside a new array. i now want to upload all the files using ajax, how i can get the files now to php so i can use $_FILES
[04:42:24] <brunoais> drakee, multiple files uploaded?
[04:42:39] <drakee> brunoais ye
[04:43:08] <brunoais> drakee, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[04:43:14] <brunoais> make an instance
[04:43:41] <brunoais> then place each File that is in the array into the FormData instance
[04:43:55] <brunoais> give a name ending with "[]" so that PHP knows it's an array
[04:44:04] <brunoais> drakee, ^
[04:44:15] <gnu_d> Hi, I added a custom icon using the class name: .ui-btn-icon-mybtn, however in my anchor button, the data-icon="mybtn" is not visible, instead a grey circle is being used, am I doing something wrong here ?
[04:44:22] <ElysiumNet> also, correct form enctype
[04:46:58] <drakee> brunoais look this is what i have by now http://pastebin.com/22i46EdJ  it shows you the image you selected now i want to make a button "upload" so all images will be uploaded you see i also create a array there so i can upload all
[04:50:51] <brunoais> drakee, ok... so?
[04:51:42] <brunoais> gnu_d, with no jsfiddle, that explanation is insufficient
[04:51:52] <drakee> brunoais and this is my upload event http://pastebin.com/k4TbsNwK   you see im trying to attach the newArray as a data for php .
[04:52:13] <drakee> like data: "test="+newArray
[04:52:25] <brunoais> drakee, no form?
[04:52:46] <drakee> brunoais no :D this will not work like this ?
[04:53:04] <gnu_d> brunoais: does jsfiddle supports jqm ?
[04:53:04] <brunoais> drakee, it can... Not that it makes sense
[04:53:29] <brunoais> gnu_d, what is jqm? Is that a lib? If it is in a cdn, it will work regardless
[04:54:02] <brunoais> drakee, You have quite some issues
[04:54:28] <brunoais> drakee, you cannot do a GET to sent binary data
[04:54:36] <brunoais> you better do a POST
[04:54:51] <gnu_d> brunoais: wasn't jqm alias for jQuery Mobile? - If not, I apologise :)
[04:55:00] <brunoais> gnu_d, I dunno. Is it?
[04:55:25] <gnu_d> brunoais: maybe :)
[04:56:53] <brunoais> drakee, what you need is the FormData object
[04:57:22] <brunoais> drakee, try using it, then ask me again. I'll guide you to fix your errors while using that object
[05:00:31] <drakee> brunoais , http://pastebin.com/EzxNCszA im trying now this object. well now on the php side i doing if(isset($_POST['file']))  print_r($_POST['file'])  it shows me an empty result.. but at least it showing :D
[05:00:39] <gnu_d> brunoais: I believe this is the needed fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/2R5JA/, don't mind the missing sprite, I don't know how to upload it
[05:01:11] <brunoais> drakee, http://us1.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.files.php
[05:02:44] <gnu_d> brunoais: fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/2R5JA/1/
[05:02:55] <d3m0n> Hey everyone. I have two simple animations that slide a paragraph up and down binded to a click. The inital click animation fires as soon as it's clicked but the second click animation seems like it has a delay added. I tried adding stop() before both animations but it doesn't do anything. Can someone take a look: http://codepen.io/jstn/rGKfC (Your browser has to be under 1000px to see the
[05:02:56] <d3m0n> clickables, just click the paragraph).
[05:03:05] <gnu_d> brunoais: now tell me why I can't see the custom icon
[05:03:28] <d3m0n> Sorry wrong link: http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/rGKfC
[05:04:16] <drakee> brunoais hm how to use this ? it's something like $_FILEs?
[05:04:43] <d3m0n> You can tell it's delayed because the same click event is attached to adding the semi transparent black box
[05:04:44] <brunoais> gnu_d, where's the element with the class "ui-icon-call"?
[05:05:09] <gnu_d> brunoais: it's <a href="index.html" data-role="button" class="icon-call" data-icon="call" data-iconpos="right">Call</a>
[05:05:15] <brunoais> sorry, d3m0n I can't help you much with jQuery animations
[05:05:29] <gnu_d> brunoais: I was following this guide http://www.interactivebynature.com/2011.04.04.jquery-mobile-custom-icons
[05:05:41] <brunoais> gnu_d, that has the class "icon-call", not "ui-icon-call"
[05:05:54] <brunoais> gnu_d, do you know CSS?
[05:06:21] <gnu_d> brunoais: I thought the jqm was using ui as a namespace or something :D
[05:06:43] <brunoais> gnu_d, it uses it to namespace its CSS so that it does not class with yours
[05:07:01] <brunoais> *clash
[05:07:10] <gnu_d> brunoais: I see no changes: http://jsfiddle.net/2R5JA/2/
[05:07:29] <gnu_d> brunoais: ok, I can see the background
[05:07:52] <gnu_d> brunoais: however how to get rid of the badge or what it's called ?
[05:08:46] <narcarsiss>  Can some one help me with this code please. http://jsfiddle.net/p44GV/  The idea is to on each page selected highlight the tab. But the navigation bar is imported via php import so i'm limited to setting only one and not the other. I'm close to code compleate and would love if someone could take a gander at it and either show me how it's done or point me in the right direction. Cheers.
[05:10:12] <onla> I am trying to validate a form field being empty first, and then if this one particular field is not numeric. Can someone check http://jsfiddle.net/y9Sh3/
[05:11:05] <brunoais> gnu_d, "ui-btn-icon-top" <- That the cause of that grey thing appearing in the middle
[05:11:43] <gnu_d> brunoais: but now the text is on top
[05:11:55] <gnu_d> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/2R5JA/3/
[05:12:39] <brunoais> gnu_d, yep.
[05:12:45] <brunoais> gnu_d, find an alternative class
[05:13:21] <brunoais> gnu_d, if no such thing exists... well... there's no alternative to overridding it...
[05:14:11] <brunoais> narcarsiss, it's awsome that it is even showing anything
[05:14:15] <brunoais> your HTML is invalid
[05:14:27] <narcarsiss> :/
[05:14:35] <drakee> when exactly is fired "change" event ?
[05:14:45] <narcarsiss> I never studied JS so im very new to how it workd
[05:15:10] <brunoais> drakee, when a form field has a different valud on blur than what it had when it was focused
[05:15:15] <d3m0n> narcarsiss: What i've done in the past is labeled my body as to which page I am on then just select the nav menu http://jsfiddle.net/p44GV/3/
[05:15:25] <brunoais> narcarsiss, that's not even js. It's HTML
[05:15:52] <narcarsiss> brunoais:  in the Javascript section. nto the html section
[05:16:41] <drakee> brunoais well because i have "change" event when i selecting files and than i have another "click" event when i click "upload" im trying to set the formData outside the 2 events and than use it inside the click
[05:17:08] <brunoais> drakee, make a form. Make the "upload" something that submits the form.
[05:17:09] <drakee> brunoais well, do jsfiddle support ajax calls ? i would like to make for you a full example but there i can't use ajax or i can
[05:17:22] <brunoais> drakee, then you do the upload when the submit event happens.
[05:18:01] <brunoais> drakee, you can. It's not about jsfiddle supporting AJAX. It is oblivous to that. It's about if your server accepts it or not.
[05:18:27] <brunoais> narcarsiss, with invalid HTML I can't test it, can I? :)
[05:18:36] <drakee> brunoais i can remotely using ajax ? i mean jsfiddle has no a php field ...
[05:18:50] <brunoais> drakee, there's no such thing as a php field
[05:18:53] <narcarsiss> you mean the missing href tags :)
[05:19:09] <brunoais> narcarsiss, no. the <a> are not properly opened
[05:19:22] <Cork> brunoais: it has an ajax echo service
[05:19:32] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[05:19:36] <Cork> drakee: ^
[05:19:36] <brunoais> :)
[05:20:09] <narcarsiss> i see my bad http://jsfiddle.net/p44GV/4/
[05:20:38] <narcarsiss> That one sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/p44GV/5/
[05:21:08] <d3m0n> narcarsiss: Did you see my post above?
[05:21:36] <narcarsiss> I missed it sorry. let me open it now
[05:21:52] <brunoais> narcarsiss, your HTML makes no sense
[05:21:54] <d3m0n> Cork! Would you mind taking a peep at my problem if you have a sec? I know it must be something easy
[05:21:58] <brunoais> you have an anchor inside an anchor
[05:22:18] <brunoais> narcarsiss, you have an anchor inside an anchor
[05:22:29] <Cork> d3m0n: can you restate the problem?
[05:22:37] <brunoais> narcarsiss, ... and you don't close the outside anchor
[05:23:52] <d3m0n> Cork: I am getting a delayed animation reaction on one of my click events - http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/rGKfC/ (The browser must be less than 1000px to see it in action, just click the first paragraph)
[05:24:26] <d3m0n> I am it's being delayed for some reason because the semi-transparent box is attached to the same click event but fires immediately
[05:24:34] <d3m0n> I know it's*
[05:25:52] <onla> why is this code not working on jsfiddle, but works on my servers http://jsfiddle.net/y9Sh3/1/
[05:26:03] <Cork> d3m0n: i don't really follow the description of the problem
[05:26:15] <onla> or removed just couple clauses
[05:26:22] <onla> s/or/I
[05:27:05] <Cork> onla: it isn't possible to test why code that works doesn't fail
[05:27:07] <d3m0n> Cork: You see the black semi-transparent boxes, right? If so, click the paragraph and it will slide down without a delay. Then click the "reduce text" button and you can see the slide up animation delay.
[05:27:45] <onla> Ok I mean that is there some problem in the code there? :)
[05:28:03] <Cork> d3m0n: clicking them does nothing
[05:28:20] <d3m0n> Cork: The paragraph part?
[05:28:25] <d3m0n> Not the heading
[05:28:47] <Cork> ah, checked the wrong link >_<
[05:29:01] <Cork> *try again!*
[05:29:11] <onla> ok, I copied that exact code to my server and it works. On jsfiddle it does not :<
[05:29:24] <d3m0n> Cork: browser has to be under 1000px too just FYI
[05:29:37] <Cork> px width or height?
[05:29:41] <brunoais> onla, link pls
[05:29:48] <d3m0n> sorry width
[05:29:53] <onla> http://jsfiddle.net/y9Sh3/1/
[05:30:25] <onla> don't get the alert on jsfiddle
[05:30:30] <drakee> brunoais well, im able to do the formData and the ajax call all inside the change event now it works. but when i want a outside "click" event there my formData not working.
[05:31:05] <brunoais> drakee, jsfiddle the code pls
[05:31:09] <Cork> d3m0n: you animate the max-height
[05:31:23] <Cork> d3m0n: so the animation will be from 1000px until the height of the element
[05:31:35] <Cork> and THEN the animation from x to 120px
[05:31:58] <d3m0n> Ahhh! Wow, why didn't I think of that. Ok.. lol that makes sense.
[05:32:05] <Cork> d3m0n: so the delay you see is the time it takes to animate from 1000px to the height you have
[05:32:24] <brunoais> onla, please repeat your code without using the on* parameters
[05:32:31] <d3m0n> Haha dang I feel stupid now.
[05:32:38] <brunoais> *attributes
[05:32:52] <Cork> d3m0n: this is why you can't do this kind of animations with transition
[05:33:50] <d3m0n> I was trying to find a work-a-round for doing animation({height: auto})
[05:33:51] <drakee> brunoais http://jsfiddle.net/PZ3r2/
[05:34:00] <onla> brunoais: what are on* attributes?
[05:34:15] <brunoais> onla, they are HTML attributes that start with the characters "on"
[05:34:28] <drakee> brunoais i was trying to do it with a upload button, but was not able to do it so i did it like this while you select a image it's also being uploaded.
[05:35:04] <MikeD_> on* ... that GM uplink/gps system
[05:35:54] <brunoais> drakee, you forgot the multiple attribute of the input
[05:36:12] <brunoais> drakee, http://jsfiddle.net/PZ3r2/1/
[05:36:39] <brunoais> drakee, otherwise you'll only get 1 file ever
[05:36:46] <CrowX-> on this website, http://whatishacking.org/thewebsite/ why is the div with class 'intro' having height 0? Inspect element says the height is set to 100%, but yet it has 0.
[05:36:59] <CrowX-> I know it's a css question, but nobody at #css would help
[05:37:10] <drakee> brunoais well , it does not matter for me so they click 5 times the button ... the images append. so idk
[05:37:14] <drakee> gfdsgf
[05:37:22] <brunoais> CrowX-, "502 Bad Gateway"
[05:38:04] <CrowX-> just a sec
[05:38:47] <brunoais> drakee, what is it doing wrong now, btw?
[05:39:18] <CrowX-> brunoais, try again please http://whatishacking.org/thewebsite/
[05:40:28] <drakee> brunoais, well i gona for a simpler solution i create 6 type="file" inputs and i simply when user click add i gona load a "loader.gif" while it's done ...  i gona leave FileReader .. anyway some browsers not support it i read. so fu ck it :D
[05:41:16] <drakee> brunoais because i have so mutch js code now that i don't understand and it's not my way i always have to have a clean mind of what's going on in the code.
[05:41:24] <brunoais> drakee, you are close to a simple solution, though
[05:41:43] <brunoais> drakee, want me to assist you?
[05:42:04] <CrowX-> brunoais, any idea about my problem?
[05:43:11] <brunoais> CrowX-, how are you trying to get the height?
[05:43:19] <brunoais> CrowX-, btw, on which browser?
[05:43:26] <CrowX-> chromium
[05:43:38] <CrowX-> and I'm not trying to get the height, i'm trying to set the height. it's just css.
[05:43:45] <drakee> brunoais i already deleted that change event :D damn it feels so good now :D , no ty i know how to go now my point was to not create 6 "browse ..." inputs just one and preview the images. but you know it's alot simpler for me do 6 "browse ..." inputs and than do my ajax call
[05:43:53] <brunoais> CrowX-, ok...
[05:43:56] <drakee> brunoais but thx alot for the effort :)
[05:44:01] <brunoais> CrowX-, It is set as 100%, though
[05:44:15] <CrowX-> brunoais, but the element shows with 0 height
[05:44:18] <CrowX-> check the box
[05:44:23] <d3m0n> CrowX-: html { height: 100%; }
[05:44:25] <CrowX-> at the bottom of inspect element
[05:45:30] <Guest____> height as a % doesn't work until all its parents have some kind of explicit height
[05:45:54] <Guest____> sorry, at least one
[05:46:12] <CrowX-> sammich_, but the parent has also 100%
[05:46:25] <brunoais> CrowX-, you have no sizable content inside. It's as if it was completely empty
[05:46:29] <sammich_> html and body need it as well
[05:46:40] <CrowX-> body has it
[05:46:41] <sammich_> also, block-level element
[05:46:50] <CrowX-> ok
[05:47:00] <brunoais> sammich_, I think the issue is also in the absolutely placed elements
[05:47:03] <CrowX-> let me check that
[05:47:33] <d3m0n> I told you the fix :P
[05:47:33] <sammich_> lets fiddle it
[05:47:33] <CrowX-> sammich_, there are two divs inside of it, aren't divs block by default?
[05:47:37] <MikeD_> absolute content would come out of flow, but an explicit height would make the box appear to be the correct size
[05:48:29] <sammich_> if the content is removed from the flow, then the parent won't have anything to define it's content size
[05:48:40] <sammich_> if it's inline*
[05:48:51] <brunoais> CrowX-, are you sure oyu need it to have position absolute?
[05:49:07] <brunoais> sounds like stuff that would work better as inline-box
[05:49:17] <sammich_> if you start messing with explicit heights, start checking out box-sising
[05:49:18] <CrowX-> brunoais, which element?
[05:49:23] <sammich_> sizing*
[05:49:25] <decx> so many people participating in one problem? sounds interesting, fiddle plz
[05:49:35] <sammich_> I'm not even sure what I'm making anymore
[05:49:50] <brunoais> decx, http://whatishacking.org/thewebsite/
[05:49:53] <MikeD_> i think it was the challenge "#css wouldn't help" that made it more interesting
[05:50:03] <decx> that's not a fiddle :Â´(
[05:50:04] <brunoais> :D
[05:50:15] <brunoais> decx, why a fiddle when you can have the real thing!
[05:50:19] <decx> well duh, #jquery is the best channel
[05:50:41] <sammich_> I come here for CSS advice too
[05:50:52] <decx> i cant live hack without extra effort brunoais ;)
[05:50:59] <CrowX-> Also, note that the height of that element is set in the 'pages' class, and other elements that have that class an are in the same container as that one have their height as real
[05:51:24] <brunoais> CrowX-, try making it without position absolute
[05:51:31] <CrowX-> brunoais, the inside element?
[05:51:38] <brunoais> CrowX-, everything
[05:51:41] <sammich_> this is getting rather vague without a sample
[05:51:45] <sammich_> maybe I missed it
[05:51:48] <brunoais> CrowX-, then remove the position relative you have
[05:52:04] <brunoais> CrowX-, then ask for my help to get the wanted result :)
[05:53:28] <CrowX-> fixed it!
[05:53:38] <CrowX-> I added "display: block" to its element
[05:53:41] <CrowX-> which is weird
[05:53:49] <CrowX-> because shouldn't it be 'block' by default?
[05:54:11] <sammich_> okay, now I need to see what you're looking at
[05:54:20] <decx> ugh, vertical slide? why reinvent the scroll wheel and handroll a ux that has decadeds of testing in it
[05:54:28] <decx> decades*
[05:55:08] <sammich_> I'm just so happy that -webkit-overflow-scrolling is a thing
[05:55:31] <sammich_> JS momentum scrolling can gdiaf
[05:56:43] <decx> get diarrhea forthwith?
[05:57:04] <sammich_> I had the most irritating issue the other day
[05:57:29] <MikeD_> decx: go die in a fire?
[05:57:50] <sammich_> yes
[05:57:50] <decx> ah, right
[05:57:55] <decx> i like mine better -.-
[05:58:08] <sammich_> I built a web app in jQM
[05:58:14] <MikeD_> "ah, right"  <-- like i didn't just make that up too
[05:58:43] <decx> well urban dictionary seems to agree
[05:58:43] <sammich_> and it had to be put into an iFrame to be placed into the web platform that served up that tool
[05:58:59] <MikeD_> oh - that's weird, i've never seen that in use
[05:59:04] <brunoais> CrowX-, I still don't see much
[05:59:12] <sammich_> that platform serves up the page with that iFrame in it
[05:59:17] <brunoais> CrowX-, A cut image on the left and some text on the right
[05:59:23] <sammich_> so, I'm left with an iFrame inside an iFrame
[05:59:24] <CrowX-> brunoais, I haven't uploaded the fixed version :)
[05:59:32] <brunoais> Oh, ok
[05:59:58] <sammich_> it's all fine on desktop
[06:00:12] <MikeD_> can you make a recursive page?
[06:00:19] <brunoais> sammich_, that's... weird, odd and "?!?!?!!"
[06:00:28] <sammich_> but the whole bloody thing explodes in a fiery mess of recurrent resize() events
[06:00:31] <brunoais> MikeD_, from a syntax standpoint, yes
[06:00:35] <sammich_> when on mobile
[06:00:50] <brunoais> sammich_, Huh?!?
[06:00:52] <sammich_> no, not recursive
[06:01:00] <brunoais> sammich_, What do you mean?
[06:01:11] <sammich_> jQM seems to fire resize events when in portrait mode on the iPad
[06:01:20] <sammich_> like, as fast as it can
[06:01:40] <sammich_> like, you can see the jQM footer slowly recede away
[06:02:13] <sammich_> if you look at the inspector, the height of the inner iFrame becomes 10k px high after a minute
[06:02:45] <brunoais> sammich_, did you try not pretending you know how to process CSS :D?
[06:02:57] <sammich_> so, I had to put in stuff to detect the orientation, and kill the resize events
[06:03:56] <sammich_> so, I eventually decided to stuff it, and now I detect touch, and break the iframe into it's own tab
[06:04:15] <sammich_> which, is annoying since on iOS 7, you can't programmatically open new tabs
[06:04:34] <sammich_> users have to tap on a a[target=_blank]
[06:04:35] <brunoais> sammich_, I'd make such that, if the viewpoert is resized, I'd do nothing and let the CSS do all the work
[06:04:45] <brunoais> it knows way better than I do how to deal with resizing
[06:05:01] <sammich_> it's not my code that doing the resizing
[06:05:15] <brunoais> sammich_, whose code is it, then?
[06:05:16] <sammich_> actually. hah, wait yes it was
[06:05:21] <sammich_> I killed it
[06:05:24] <brunoais> good
[06:05:30] <brunoais> now burn it
[06:05:42] <sammich_> but I still had the double overflow of nested iframes
[06:05:52] <sammich_> which is really annoying on mobile
[06:06:05] <brunoais> leave the displaying work to CSS. It knows it way better than you do
[06:06:58] <sammich_> I don't think CSS can make something 'fill the rest of the screen'
[06:07:21] <sammich_> the iFrame ideally should start where it is, until the bottom of the viewport
[06:09:22] <bberry> how is $("#mything").on("blur" ... and $("#mything").on("change" ... any different?
[06:09:54] <decx> if i leave a field and don't change anything blur will fire but change wont
[06:09:59] <sammich_> blur happens after losing focus
[06:10:15] <brunoais> sammich_, that's not the difference
[06:10:23] <bberry> gotcha
[06:10:39] <sammich_> it's not a difference, but I'm sure that 'change' kinda describes itself
[06:10:53] <bberry> yeah, i understand now
[06:10:58] <brunoais> CrowX-, I still cannot see more than a cropped image on the left and some text on the right :S
[06:11:11] <sammich_> whatishacking, right?
[06:11:21] <brunoais> sammich_, what?
[06:11:40] <CrowX-> brunoais, I still haven't uploaded the fixed version. since there are other unfinished things.
[06:11:49] <CrowX-> but if you're curious, I could upload now to see what you helped me fix :)
[06:12:35] <brunoais> CrowX-, yes pls
[06:12:37] <brunoais> I'm curious
[06:12:44] <sammich_> where is this website?
[06:12:53] <brunoais> sam452, http://whatishacking.org/thewebsite/
[06:12:53] <CrowX-> brunoais, done
[06:12:54] <brunoais> ups
[06:13:01] <brunoais> sammich_,  http://whatishacking.org/thewebsite/
[06:13:04] <sammich_> I thought so
[06:13:10] <sammich_> yeah, that site does nothing for me
[06:13:12] <brunoais> CrowX-, no difference
[06:13:32] <CrowX-> the server probably caches it
[06:13:35] <CrowX-> i'll upload in new folder
[06:13:53] <sammich_> someone likes HTML comments
[06:14:47] <sammich_> is it convention to put jQuery/libraries at the top of the page, and your own code at the bottom?
[06:14:56] <Cork> sammich_: at least it isn't <!------------------> comments
[06:15:16] <Cork> sammich_: yes it is
[06:15:21] <sammich_> hey, there's a name I recognise
[06:15:29] <Cork> sammich_: some of jquerys features depend on it
[06:15:43] <sammich_> I haven't been on this channel for a good 3-4 months
[06:17:45] <bberry> Why does jquery not have an input event?
[06:18:01] <sammich_> I recently got into Bootstrap. My god, it's like a bajillion times better than jQuery UI
[06:18:18] <sammich_> on('listen', function()
[06:18:21] <sammich_> what
[06:18:25] <xec> bberry: .on("input", ...) ?
[06:18:27] <sammich_> on('input', function()
[06:18:31] <bberry> yeah
[06:18:53] <bberry> well... if i google input event jquery, i seem to get no hits.
[06:18:55] <sammich_> on('anyEventNameYouCanShakeAStickAt', function()
[06:19:03] <sammich_> will also work, as long as it's been fired
[06:19:13] <CrowX-> brunoais, http://whatishacking.org/thewebsite2
[06:19:23] <sammich_> jQuery has a bunch of helper events
[06:19:26] <xec> bberry: it's a browser dom event, nothing to do with jquery
[06:19:28] <sammich_> like change, click
[06:19:50] <bberry> sammich_ yeah, i was expecting jquery to have a .input i guess
[06:19:50] <sammich_> the rest you'll have to listen or trigger manually
[06:19:55] <brunoais> CrowX-, \o/ for pink!
[06:20:19] <brunoais> CrowX-, I only see pink
[06:20:34] <CrowX-> aren't some words starting to appear?
[06:20:45] <sammich_> ah yeah, I see the words
[06:20:59] <brunoais> CrowX-, nope
[06:21:02] <brunoais> all pink
[06:21:04] <CrowX-> whic hbrowser?
[06:21:10] <brunoais> FF
[06:21:20] <sammich_> Chrome
[06:22:02] <sammich_> so, does that splash only open up once?
[06:22:06] <sammich_> show*
[06:22:35] <xec> bberry: you could just make your own alias if you want, $.fn.input = function(callback) { return this.on("input", callback); };
[06:22:42] <CrowX-> sammich_, yeah
[06:22:54] <CrowX-> sammich_, but there will be a button for upwards too
[06:23:17] <CrowX-> brunoais, my ff opens it fine
[06:23:20] <CrowX-> try clearing cache please
[06:23:33] <sammich_> I don't like clearing my caches :)
[06:23:49] <brunoais> CrowX-, still pink
[06:24:44] <CrowX-> brunoais, you do have javascript enabled, right? :P
[06:24:52] <sammich_> I discovered Chrome's media and device emulation
[06:25:00] <brunoais> CrowX-, I'm after CSS, not js
[06:25:01] <Cork> bberry: wait why should a script framework have an input element?!?
[06:25:24] <CrowX-> brunoais, well js should load the rest of the stuff
[06:25:37] <sammich_> <input></input> - is that semantic enough?
[06:25:43] <brunoais> CrowX-, on page load?
[06:25:46] <Cork> sammich_: that is invalid
[06:25:55] <CrowX-> brunoais, yes
[06:26:03] <DarsVaeda> is there some thing using ip urls with $.ajax?
[06:26:12] <brunoais> CrowX-, why?
[06:26:24] <brunoais> CrowX-, why not place it all on page load?
[06:26:28] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you can use ip in an url if you want
[06:26:30] <sammich_> a valid URL is a valid URL
[06:26:37] <DarsVaeda> works with any url especially a local one, but with an ip it does nothing
[06:26:48] <DarsVaeda> the ip itself works in the browser
[06:27:06] <Cork> DarsVaeda: is the ip a different domain then the one loaded from?
[06:27:22] <Cork> DarsVaeda: cause that would still be cross domain
[06:27:34] <DarsVaeda> uhm hmm uhm
[06:27:42] <sammich_> ah yeah, that's clefar, forgot about that
[06:27:45] <brunoais> CrowX-, where are you setting this to pink?
[06:27:46] <CrowX-> brunoais, the things are loaded without js, but their opacity is 0 by default, and js should make it slowly to
[06:27:46] <CrowX-> 1
[06:27:56] <CrowX-> brunoais, pink is the background
[06:27:59] <CrowX-> of .content
[06:28:14] <brunoais> CrowX-, why isn't that fade made by CSS?
[06:28:25] <DarsVaeda> that is actually my local ip
[06:28:33] <DarsVaeda> hmm
[06:28:40] <CrowX-> brunoais, because the elements appear one by one, with a 0.1s delay
[06:28:43] <sammich_> hah
[06:28:58] <sammich_> 127.0.0.1 should've given it away ;)
[06:29:14] <MikeD_> you don't want people to know your IP, they'll hack it
[06:29:17] <MikeD_> :p
[06:30:06] <DarsVaeda> sammich_, refering to me?
[06:30:10] <Cork> MikeD_: its cool just change it to 107.1.0.1
[06:30:18] <Cork> opps
[06:30:21] <Cork> *127
[06:30:28] <brunoais> CrowX-, did you try progressive enhancement :S?
[06:30:28] <MikeD_> i just imagined a script kiddie with a stolen botnet ddos attacking 127.0.0.1
[06:30:32] <sammich_> Cork, way too slow
[06:30:39] <CrowX-> brunoais, no idea what that is
[06:31:00] <Cork> sammich_: what is?
[06:31:01] <DarsVaeda> but even if it would be cross domain wouldn't that generate some kind of error?
[06:31:15] <sammich_> referring to the localhost
[06:31:22] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it should be logged in the browser console
[06:31:32] <Cork> sammich_: ah :)
[06:31:37] <brunoais> CrowX-, To make it simple, it's to make 1st the HTML (and have something with content and no presentation) then add CSS (and have the presentation) then add js (and have the dynamics)
[06:31:58] <sammich_> yeah, I'd recommend a complete rewrite
[06:32:08] <brunoais> sammich_, no way
[06:32:29] <brunoais> CrowX-, you can do that in a super simple way
[06:32:38] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it might also be a specific block the browsers add, as there is so many hacks like this now days it wouldn't surprise me if they start blocking it
[06:32:39] <sammich_> gets rid of the baggage
[06:32:42] <DarsVaeda> I do $.getScript("/javascripts/file.js") works but $.getScript("http://192.168.0.100/~user/domain.com/javascripts/file.js") doesn't not even an error
[06:32:50] <brunoais> it only requires a class in the <body> and a single javascript statement
[06:33:10] <Cork> DarsVaeda: hmm
[06:33:12] <MikeD_> Q: you know how much time i'd lose on all the part that I already did?  A: about 1/10 as much time as you'll waste trying to make this dead end go somewhere  (just sayin)
[06:33:13] <brunoais> CrowX-, it only requires a class in the <body> and a single javascript statement
[06:33:34] <brunoais> CrowX-, you can also get rid of all that JS that runs to add opacity and such. Just use CSS directly
[06:33:53] <CrowX-> brunoais, can't. every element has different delay
[06:34:00] <CrowX-> in css, I'd have to set it separately for each element
[06:34:05] <CrowX-> in js, I just run a loop
[06:34:09] <CrowX-> that increases the delay
[06:34:12] <DarsVaeda> problem is I need to test something from my smartphone in the local net on the server but I setup a vhost to fake a domain that does not work from the phone obviously so I need to put the ips in
[06:34:17] <sammich_> if you're learning CSS/JS like this, you end up with a page that has a lot of issues with fixes applied on top
[06:34:36] <sammich_> a complete rewrite lets you apply all you've learned without the junk
[06:34:44] <brunoais> CrowX-, That's no excuse not to add the progressive enhancement, though
[06:35:11] <brunoais> CrowX-, I'm not sure, for what I can tell, it's just fade-in's right?
[06:35:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: getting a script from a separate domain should generate a <script> added to the head of the document
[06:35:23] <brunoais> CrowX-, *I'm not sure, for what I can tell... it's just fade-in's right?
[06:35:27] <MikeD_> most of this webstuff is actually very easy, if you're struggling a lot it typically means you're doing it wrong.
[06:35:34] <Cork> DarsVaeda: so it shouldn't even get xss problems
[06:35:36] <sammich_> or you're learning
[06:35:46] <CrowX-> brunoais, it's fade in element after an element
[06:36:19] <brunoais> CrowX-, k'ay. Just make the CSS rule that makes it all invisible into 2 rules
[06:36:30] <brunoais> *visible and invisible
[06:36:45] <sammich_> var $els = $(selector);
[06:36:59] <sammich_> $($els).doSomething()
[06:37:00] <Manaus> hello, I have an <a href="#someid?foo=10"  which should open a modal with 10 as some parameter, but I get 'unreconized expression'
[06:37:10] <brunoais> CrowX-, Right after the <body> tag (inside the body), use js to remove the 2nd class
[06:37:16] <sammich_> I've seen that on production stuff. It's saddening
[06:37:35] <brunoais> CrowX-, Or you could do the inverse and it adds a CSS class instead
[06:37:37] <DarsVaeda> Cork, he puts that in but seems the code is not run in it
[06:37:50] <Cork> brunoais: uh you should never have js at the top of <body>
[06:38:18] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and the browsers network tab doesn't logg any calls?
[06:38:23] <brunoais> CrowX-, with (without) that CSS class, it will display everything like it shows with js on page load (with no animations)
[06:38:26] <brunoais> Cork, why?
[06:38:33] <bumbar> why do i get TypeError: undefined is not a function if i do: text = "#field"; $(field).live("click", function ... );
[06:38:39] <Cork> brunoais: cause you run before any dom elements exist
[06:38:48] <sammich_> live has been replacaed with on
[06:38:48] <Cork> brunoais: and if you do that then you can just as well do it in head
[06:38:53] <DarsVaeda> Cork, nope but it is in the head
[06:39:09] <Cork> DarsVaeda: what?
[06:39:11] <brunoais> Cork, it's right after <body>, not before
[06:39:29] <Cork> brunoais: like i said you should never have script at the beginning of <body>
[06:39:29] <brunoais> Cork, by the HTML spec, the <body>, at that time, is already defined
[06:39:30] <sammich_> stick all your JS at end of body
[06:39:39] <sammich_> all your dependencies in head
[06:39:42] <Cork> ya end of body or in head
[06:39:44] <Cork> not beginning
[06:39:45] <bumbar> sammich_, can't believe i didn't try this... thanks!
[06:39:58] <brunoais> Cork, why not at the beginning?
[06:40:05] <sammich_> timing issues
[06:40:18] <brunoais> if you don't there will be FOUC
[06:40:33] <DarsVaeda> cork, in firebug I can see the <script> call getting added to the head but there is nothing logged to the console that it actually loads the script, code in the script is not run too, so I guess it does not load
[06:40:49] <DarsVaeda> +it
[06:40:50] <sammich_> check the network tab
[06:40:54] <sammich_> net*
[06:41:02] <DarsVaeda> empty
[06:41:05] <Cork> DarsVaeda: not inspect the network tab
[06:41:06] <sammich_> refresh
[06:41:17] <brunoais> Cork, what's the issue of a single inline javascript statement?
[06:41:33] <sammich_> why are you removing a class onload?
[06:41:58] <Cork> brunoais: 1. if you want the code to load before the content shows you add it in head
[06:42:02] <sammich_> I thought inline JS went the way of the dodo
[06:42:14] <Cork> brunoais: if you want the page to show as fast as possible then you put it at the end of body
[06:42:27] <Cork> brunoais: there is no point in adding the script at the beginning of body
[06:42:33] <Cork> it just makes things messy
[06:42:47] <Cork> the script will still block page load
[06:43:04] <brunoais> Cork, for what? 0.0001s while the code is processed?
[06:43:07] <Cork> so you can just as well put it where it is preferable to have scripts
[06:43:15] <DarsVaeda> oh ajax instead of getScript gives an error
[06:43:16] <sammich_> no, the request to the server
[06:43:19] <Cork> brunoais: depends on network latency
[06:43:40] <brunoais> Cork, did you read what I wrote or are you really serious?
[06:43:44] <sammich_> I should tag people's names more
[06:43:56] <Cork> brunoais: not it isn't invalid to do it, it is just really not recommended
[06:44:09] <Cork> brunoais: i read what you wrote
[06:44:15] <sammich_> I think it's just actual JS, not a script[src]
[06:44:19] <Cork> the statement still stands
[06:44:32] <Cork> there is only two places you should ever put scripts
[06:44:34] <brunoais> Cork, What's the problem with the delay of 0.0001s?
[06:44:48] <Cork> in head after styles or at the very end of body
[06:44:48] <sammich_> yeah, mixing JS in the middle of your document is just semantically so so wrong
[06:45:18] <brunoais> Cork, what is the issue? I don't get it.
[06:45:25] <brunoais> what is wrong?
[06:45:31] <Cork> brunoais: you've been told a long list of them
[06:45:42] <Cork> to renumerate them:
[06:45:44] <brunoais> Cork, you only told me about latency
[06:46:07] <brunoais> \o/ *.net *.split!
[06:46:09] <sammich_> still here
[06:46:30] <brunoais> \o/ *.net *.split!
[06:46:31] <Cork> 1. code race, you might run before elements run 2. maintainability, you spread your in the html (BAD) 3. load time, 4. just pure best practice
[06:46:33] <Cork> and so on
[06:46:44] <Cork> *elements exist
[06:46:52] <sammich_> document.write
[06:46:55] <sammich_> that'll do it
[06:47:35] <Deele> is it possible to get somehow data, that was sent with ajax, out from from jQuery XHR object that is returned from $.ajax()
[06:47:41] <Cork> so ya, you really really never want to put scripts in that place unless you are forced by something like the backend
[06:47:43] <brunoais> Cork, 1. The element is guaranteed to exist 2. it's the top of the <body> for the crying out loud! Not somewhere lost inside it. 3. I don't get that one, sorry. 4. I dunno about that one
[06:48:10] <Cork> Deele: no
[06:48:40] <decx> script at the top of body?
[06:48:49] <decx> i've been seeing more and more of it
[06:48:52] <Cork> brunoais: hey go at it, create your own nightmare, just don't instruct others to do it
[06:48:58] <sammich_> right inside the body tag
[06:49:09] <brunoais> decx, an inline script
[06:49:12] <brunoais> just this:
[06:50:11] <brunoais> <script>document.body.className += "someClass"</script>
[06:50:20] <brunoais> decx, ^
[06:50:24] <brunoais> Is that too much code?
[06:50:31] <sammich_> how about body[class=alreadyHasTheClassInIt]
[06:50:37] <Cork> it isn't the amount it is the position
[06:50:59] <brunoais> Cork, does the <body> tag exist in the <head>?
[06:51:06] <decx> why not solve that on the backend?
[06:51:07] <sammich_> what
[06:51:10] <xec> lol
[06:51:27] <sammich_> I've been using that jackie chan meme a lot today
[06:51:30] <sammich_> *insert it here*
[06:51:33] <brunoais> decx, how do you know if the js you are sending has errors or not?
[06:51:33] <Cork> brunoais: if you add it to head you wait for domcontentloaded
[06:51:43] <Cork> brunoais: or just add it at the end of body
[06:51:48] <brunoais> Cork, how about the FOUC?
[06:51:49] <Cork> your exact line works fine there
[06:52:02] <Cork> fouc?
[06:52:09] <sammich_> flash of unstyled content
[06:52:24] <Cork> domcontentloaded is fired before rendering starts
[06:52:37] <Cork> so ya, you won't get any
[06:52:40] <brunoais> In this case it is incmpletely styled content, though
[06:52:49] <brunoais> Cork, that is false
[06:52:52] <Cork> ...
[06:52:59] <Cork> oh, prove it
[06:53:02] <Cork> *ok
[06:53:04] <brunoais> pls wait
[06:53:15] <Cork> give me a script that adds the styling class in a DOMContentLoaded
[06:53:21] <Cork> and it is added after the content shows
[06:53:53] <Cork> (hint you will have a VERY hard time doing so)
[06:53:56] <DarsVaeda> Cork, xhr throws an expection but not really with much of any information in it, seems getScript can't handle that
[06:54:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: getScript doesn't use xhr for cross domain scripts
[06:54:34] <decx> i havent dealt with fouc since i moved to modernizr
[06:54:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: also getScript is just a helper for $.ajax(url, { type: 'script' });
[06:55:07] <DarsVaeda> right so I changed it to ajax
[06:55:12] <DarsVaeda> that throws an error
[06:55:29] <Cork> decx: haven't had a need to deal with it since browsers fixed that problem in early 2k
[06:55:30] <DarsVaeda> leading to a line where it does "xhr.open..."
[06:56:01] <Cork> (when domcontentloaded was added)
[06:57:09] <decx> what if you have something that you hide because you have a button to show it with js, but want to show it all the time in a no-js scenario?
[06:57:28] <Cork> decx: domcontentloaded
[06:57:42] <Cork> decx: that is exactly the use case that cause them to implement it
[06:57:51] <Cork> *caused
[06:58:48] <decx> huh i guess
[06:58:58] <brunoais> Cork, http://brunoaisserver.dtdns.net/provingIt.php
[06:59:27] <decx> i cant remember if i ever used domcontentloaded and not jquery doc ready or window onload with native
[06:59:52] <brunoais> decx, jQuery uses DOMContentLoaded if the browser supports it
[07:00:01] <decx> well yeah but i don't see it :>
[07:00:13] <decx> *have to see it
[07:00:23] <brunoais> decx, you have to wait for the page to load
[07:00:29] <brunoais> then it does the alert
[07:01:03] <brunoais> decx, as there are no images, the DOMContentLoaded is fired just before the load event
[07:01:20] <Cork> brunoais: it why would anyone load a page of 12 mb??
[07:01:38] <brunoais> Cork, it makes it easier to prove my point that you were wrong
[07:01:39] <Cork> and yes you have a timeout when the browser won't hold of rendering the page
[07:01:46] <decx> that's the way we're going with angular attributes clogging up the markup cork ;)
[07:02:13] <Cork> brunoais: i meant in a reasonable page
[07:02:22] <Cork> meaning one that you actually would write
[07:02:38] <decx> well you cant change requirements after the proof :)
[07:02:40] <brunoais> Cork, as a test page it's hard to make
[07:02:41] <Cork> but yes no browser will hold of rendering the page for several minutes
[07:02:53] <brunoais> Cork, Hum... for example
[07:11:17] <brunoais> Cork, try to acess here
[07:11:18] <brunoais> http://brunoaisserver.dtdns.net/provingIt.php
[07:11:22] <brunoais> I have ot go to a meeting now
[07:11:28] <brunoais> ttyl
[07:11:55] <Cork> don't get any content flashing
[07:18:03] <dman777_alter> anyone use http://jsearchdropdown.sourceforge.net/? can't get it to work...it doesn't error out...just doesn't show the search box
[07:18:31] <bberry> this is what i came up with.... http://jsfiddle.net/mCG3G/2/
[07:18:47] <bberry> for the alert list thing we were talkinga bout yesterday
[07:19:06] <bberry> i wish i could make the code a lot shorter
[07:19:42] <bberry> also, id like to move away from using classnames for each item. dont know what to use though. :/
[07:20:01] <sammich_> what are you trying to do?
[07:20:28] <bberry> just show a list of errors to the user as theyre inputting to textboxes
[07:21:02] <sammich_> just wrap the input inside a span or div
[07:21:12] <sammich_> and another span inline with the input
[07:21:30] <sammich_> div>input+span.message
[07:21:54] <bberry> so you mean have the message appear off to the right of the input?
[07:22:23] <sammich_> yeah
[07:22:38] <sammich_> label to the left, input, then message
[07:22:52] <bberry> yeah i could
[07:23:01] <bberry> the way my site is set up right now id have to change things
[07:23:04] <dman777_alter> anyone know of a jquery plug in that would have a search box in addition to the select drop down list? I like http://jsearchdropdown.sourceforge.net/ but can't seem to make it work
[07:23:14] <sammich_> try to avoid using tables for displaying content, exception for lots of tabular data
[07:23:20] <bberry> yeah
[07:23:26] <sammich_> dman777_alter: selec2
[07:23:29] <sammich_> select2*
[07:23:47] <bberry> right now i have it so that its like label, input text, label, text
[07:23:51] <beancurd> or chosen js
[07:23:52] <bberry> and theres like 5 rows of that
[07:24:09] <decx> what does it validate against?
[07:24:12] <bberry> er, that last 'text' should be 'input text'
[07:24:18] <decx> why is that hardcoded?
[07:24:30] <decx> now you'd have to do that for every field
[07:24:38] <bberry> decx my stuff?
[07:24:46] <decx> ye
[07:25:06] <bberry> i just put that in there for example. the actual validation is different
[07:25:25] <bberry> in the end its a true/false though
[07:25:34] <dman777_alter> sammich_: nice...thanks!
[07:26:33] <decx> seems strange that it's dupllicating the whole block per input
[07:26:45] <decx> why not http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mCG3G/3/
[07:26:47] <bberry> decx, eh?
[07:26:58] <bberry> ah
[07:27:14] <sammich_> bberry: http://jsfiddle.net/mCG3G/4/
[07:27:37] <sammich_> I like mine better :)
[07:28:01] <bberry> haha, yeah im going to suggest to my team to change the layout
[07:28:10] <bberry> because right now i have two input items side by side
[07:28:16] <bberry> but i think having them all in a line is better
[07:28:20] <exskoop> yo, why this don't work ? http://jsfiddle.net/kvrJ7/
[07:29:43] <bberry> decx: unfortunately i cant use the 'data' thing that you had. wish i could. the validation part is more like, is it alphanumeric, is it less than X and greater than Y, etc
[07:29:47] <bberry> and each input is different
[07:29:56] <sammich_> exskoop: http://jsfiddle.net/kvrJ7/1/
[07:30:30] <bberry> decx: but i do like the table input text selector you have, that makes things shorter by a good bit
[07:31:09] <bberry> though idk if i can use it because every input is different for its validation :/
[07:31:35] <bberry> maybe i could set up the callback functions for each input separately
[07:31:36] <decx> exskoop in your example it was waiting for a submit event from the submit button, but only forms send a submit event
[07:31:38] <sammich_> put a data-attribute
[07:31:52] <bberry> can data-attributes be functions?
[07:32:05] <sammich_> no, you read it and use it to switch your logic
[07:32:14] <bberry> ah, yeah that might work
[07:32:37] <sammich_> it will work ;)
[07:38:19] <narcarsiss> is this Valid if (current_page.match(about.php){ //Do something}
[07:39:58] <sammich_> narcarsiss: /about.php/.test(document.location.href)
[07:40:16] <sammich_> narcarsiss: if (/about.php/.test(document.location.href)) { }
[07:40:29] <bberry> sammich_ haha
[07:40:51] <bberry> sammich_ it will work if i dont completely suck at web development*
[07:40:52] <sammich_> hmm?
[07:41:05] <sammich_> you only suck until you don't
[07:41:25] <narcarsiss> cool same as i got. but i was already storing document.location.href in current_page
[07:41:42] <bberry> lol
[07:42:15] <narcarsiss> sammich_:  why the / <?
[07:42:46] <sammich_> it's regex
[07:43:40] <narcarsiss> ahh
[07:43:45] <sammich_> I was a total noob at all things web dev
[07:44:03] <sammich_> one day, I decided to build a POS type thing on my iPad
[07:44:18] <sammich_> web app, of course
[07:44:27] <dman777_alter> sammich_: do I need to compile the source code of select2 with npm install and bower install?
[07:44:38] <sammich_> now I get paid to do that stuff
[07:44:53] <sammich_> dman777_alter: no, just get the source
[07:45:35] <sammich_> you want the select2.min.js inside the zip
[07:45:49] <sammich_> along with the resources that go along with it
[07:46:25] <sammich_> I recently built a pretty awesome little search box with select2
[07:47:23] <narcarsiss> sammich_:  I wonder cause im checking for 5 pages instead of copy paste code 5 times if i can loop it to check for one of 5 pages? Knowing my looping skills i shall stackoverflow XD
[07:48:18] <sammich_> is that code going inside a header.php file?
[07:48:25] <narcarsiss> yes
[07:48:38] <hypfer> hi, i have this date: 2014-05-16T18:00:00.000+02:00 and I want to see how many days/hours it is from now. how?
[07:48:42] <dman777_alter> sammich_: ah...thanks!
[07:48:45] <sammich_> can't you just do that detection in php?
[07:49:05] <narcarsiss> sammich_: I have no idea I had to pay a guy to do my php :/
[07:49:08] <sammich_> hypfer: do you have the date or just the string?
[07:49:20] <hypfer> sammich_: i only have that string
[07:49:34] <sammich_> okay
[07:49:55] <sammich_> new Date('2014-05-16T18:00:00.000+02:00')
[07:49:56] <sammich_> chrome will take that just fine
[07:50:28] <sammich_> (new Date() - thatDate)/(1000 * 3600 * 24)
[07:50:31] <sammich_> that'll be days
[07:50:43] <sammich_> hours is just the mod of that * 24
[07:51:51] <exskoop> i have a "submit" event how to get all the data now ? that is submited
[07:52:04] <hypfer> sammich_: not a Number :(
[07:52:13] <sammich_> what browser?
[07:52:51] <hypfer> sammich_: chrome. sec. i'm making a fiddle
[07:53:02] <sammich_> var theDate = new Date('2014-05-16T18:00:00.000+02:00');
[07:53:09] <sammich_> var days = (new Date() - theDate)/(1000 * 3600 * 24)
[07:53:39] * BillCriswell hugs moment.js
[07:53:43] <hypfer> done
[07:53:50] <sammich_> I was gonna say. I love moment.js
[07:53:59] <sammich_> fromNow and calendar are so good
[07:54:33] <exskoop> for what i need the serialize?
[07:54:52] <hypfer> I think I should use moment.js, right?
[07:54:58] <BillCriswell> sammich_: Good stuff.
[07:55:17] <BillCriswell> hypfer: If you're doing more than like one thing with dates I think it's a good investment lol.
[07:55:27] <bberry> so, i know not to use tables except for table-like data, but if i had like <span>foo</span><input type='text'.../> and i had a bunch of rows of that, the inputs arent aligned. do i need to put a margin-left on each input?
[07:55:52] <sammich_> give the labels a fixed width
[07:56:08] <BillCriswell> bberry: display block on label with a fixed width would do it.
[07:56:10] <sammich_> use the <label> tag, it's more semantically correct
[07:56:18] <sammich_> inline-block*
[07:56:19] <bberry> okay
[07:56:27] <BillCriswell> Oh, you didn't even use the label tag.
[07:56:35] <bberry> yeah, im with ya now
[07:56:37] <BillCriswell> I instinctively did that haha.
[07:57:00] <bberry> so should the label wrap the input?
[07:57:21] <bberry> or should i use the 'for' thing?
[07:57:21] <BillCriswell> Not if you want them in columns.
[07:57:31] <sammich_> if you look at my example which was /3/
[07:57:33] <sammich_> sorry /4/
[07:57:34] <bberry> k
[07:57:51] <bberry> didnt notice that before XD
[07:58:38] <sammich_> the label with the 'for' that makes the 'id' also does the focus for the element when you click on the label
[07:58:52] <sammich_> matches*
[07:59:30] <bberry> so. dont get mad at me. but why should we NOT use tables for layout?
[07:59:49] <sammich_> they're not designed for that purpose
[07:59:56] <sammich_> they're fixed
[08:00:23] <sammich_> tables are for data, not content
[08:00:28] * narcarsiss Made a short black to to learn javascript in a day
[08:01:06] <sammich_> it's taken me a year to get to this point
[08:01:52] <narcarsiss_Away> I have Python Java under my belt but forever since i did it so now im all dumb :?
[08:02:12] <BillCriswell> bberry: http://jsbin.com/dedocuvu/1/edit?html,css,output were you looking for something like this?
[08:03:06] <sammich_> right aligned form labels aren't my thing
[08:03:59] <BillCriswell> sammich_: If they're to the left in this case it just gets to be kind of a pain in the butt in my eyes.
[08:04:34] <sammich_> there's pros/cons for both
[08:04:36] <BillCriswell> You'd need to adjust the width so the input is close enough to form but the length of the labels could end up making some a lot further from the input that you'd like.
[08:04:40] <BillCriswell> sammich_: Absolutely.
[08:04:54] <sammich_> right is okay for like one word
[08:05:07] <sammich_> but LTR languages, I prefer LTR
[08:07:06] <BillCriswell> sammich_: Yeah, it all depends.
[08:07:42] <MikeD_> any idea how to get the window height and width?
[08:07:51] <MikeD_> ... in IE10
[08:08:03] <sammich_> window.innerHeight?
[08:09:19] <decx> beware innerWidth includes the scrollbar
[08:09:31] <MikeD_> i'm feeding those values to a window.open call  (actually a proprietary thing that mimics window.open)
[08:14:42] <onethfour> why is http://jsfiddle.net/74cPJ/ adding 2 hidden elements one without an ID
[08:15:25] <decx> after doesnt traverse
[08:15:34] <decx> you're just changing the id on your existing input
[08:16:19] <sammich_> well, you're adding one to the one that's already there
[08:16:28] <onethfour> http://jsfiddle.net/74cPJ/1/ and this seems to do it
[08:16:32] <sammich_> that's why there's two...
[08:16:43] <onethfour> no there was three
[08:17:01] <sammich_> there's 2
[08:17:02] <onethfour> its ok i'll use insertAfter
[08:17:06] <onethfour> thanks
[08:17:32] <DarsVaeda> is there still a colorpicker in jqueryui?
[08:17:58] <narcarsiss> sammich_: you seem like a cool dude (compliment bribe?) can you take a look. i left comments in html part. http://jsfiddle.net/fCNe8/26/
[08:18:15] <sammich_> you got half of it right
[08:18:23] <narcarsiss> me?
[08:18:28] <sammich_> yes
[08:18:30] <narcarsiss> woot
[08:18:36] <narcarsiss> then i got confused :?
[08:18:36] <sammich_> I am a dude
[08:19:04] <cbuchler> Wait a minute.. when I setup multiple Environments, do I need to set that up as well for controllers, models and Views?
[08:19:06] <narcarsiss> oh cheeeky
[08:19:16] <cbuchler> Oh wrong channel..
[08:19:24] <sammich_> yes. very wrong
[08:19:34] <sammich_> no talk of MVCs here
[08:20:03] <sammich_> oh, read the comment
[08:20:19] <narcarsiss> :)
[08:21:05] <decx> why bother with matching the location if you can just add a current class on the menu element that was clicked?
[08:21:42] <narcarsiss> decx: I dont know what im doing it's partly about 7 diff stackover flow pages :/
[08:22:40] <decx> i know some of these words -.-
[08:23:30] <sammich_> can you modify the css file?
[08:23:34] <sammich_> narcarsiss\
[08:24:03] <narcarsiss> Yes
[08:24:26] <sammich_> you'll need to add an 'active' class to the selector that defines width:100%;
[08:24:51] <narcarsiss> let me take a look.
[08:24:51] <dman777_alter> sammich_: hmm...select2 works great but can't get placeholder to show up in  placeholder: "Type in name",
[08:24:52] <sammich_> then you add that class to the a# you're targeting
[08:25:40] <sammich_> are you using with a single select option?
[08:25:45] <sammich_> "When placeholder is used for a non-multi-value select box, it requires that you include an empty <option></option> tag as your first option."
[08:26:25] <dman777_alter> sammich_: hmm...no...it's multi-value. but let me try that anyways
[08:27:43] <dman777_alter> sammich_: naw...still no luck. I am using Django templating...that shouldn't have anything to do it, right?
[08:27:51] <sammich_> never used it
[08:27:58] <sammich_> shouldn't do?
[08:30:02] <sammich_> dman777_alter: http://jsfiddle.net/LUsMb/2954/
[08:33:12] <MikeD_> $(window).height() and $(document).height() return the same value  ?  is that expected?
[08:35:21] <sammich_> if (document.height < window.height) document.height = window.height
[08:35:24] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Your content doesnt need to scroll if that's the case.
[08:37:32] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/xaxutuna/1/
[08:39:50] <sammich_> http://jsbin.com/xaxutuna/2
[08:39:52] <sammich_> better demo :)
[08:41:30] <dman777_alter> sammich_: thanks...I was missing multiple
[08:42:06] <BillCriswell> sammich_: Toadlily.
[08:43:05] <sammich_> I get it
[08:43:22] <MikeD_> i'm trying to determine if the page is in a viewport that has toolbars above it
[08:43:26] <MikeD_> i know, that's dumb
[08:43:41] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Haha
[08:43:45] <MikeD_> but i'm not sure if there another way to know if the window has been dechromed
[08:44:06] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah, I don't think there's any way to tell that.
[08:45:11] <BillCriswell> Just discovered document.designMode = 'on' basically makes everything editable.
[08:46:20] <sammich_> is it a document wide contentEditable?
[08:46:57] <sammich_> hah, it is too
[08:47:41] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document so many things I never touch in here.
[08:47:49] <sammich_> are you in IE MikeD_ ? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/ie/ms536651(v=vs.85).aspx
[08:48:06] <sammich_> scroll down to 'toolbar'
[08:50:16] <MikeD_> hmm... perhaps I should just communicate to the new window via a #youaredechromed suffix to the url
[08:52:53] <sammich_> nite
[08:54:24] <narcarsiss> Noooo Sammich Why you leave you didnt get the Good news :'( It works :D
[08:58:34] <MikeD_> what happens if I try to add a #anchor or #id reference to the end of a url that already contains one?
[08:59:04] <MikeD_> don't say "complete protonic reversal" because that was my first smart-ass thought
[09:01:17] <exskoop> how i check if (data) from ajax is empty or not
[09:01:32] <exskoop> becaause i know when empty data is returned i have no errors in my code.
[09:02:31] <decx> MikeD_ it'll look for the hash #oldhash#anchor as one
[09:03:13] <MikeD_> that's probably ok then
[09:03:29] <bowenac> is there a better option to clearing a textarea than $( "#message-contact-form" ).val('');
[09:03:52] <bowenac> I am trying to re append after clearing a form and it doesn't work... but if I don't clear the form like that before re appending the append works
[09:03:54] <bowenac> any ideas?
[09:03:54] <decx> no that's ok
[09:04:21] <decx> of course there's always the native reset() for forms
[09:05:08] <bowenac> I am removing an item from a wishlist, when they remove the item I need to clear the text area then re append the wishlist items to the textarea in the form. But for some reason when I clear the textarea I can no longer append to it. Why would that be?
[09:06:11] <decx> separate the problem and recreate it in a fiddle
[09:06:27] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/F05apT31
[09:06:38] <bowenac> this is what I am using. Ok will create a fiddle
[09:06:58] <crash1hd> whats wrong with this? $( ".formulaBox span" ).css({"background-color":$(this).parent().css("background-color")})
[09:07:18] <najemnyvrah> I have a number "1.2.3" and I want to iterate the second digit. like "1.3.3", "1.4.3" and so on. I was thinking regex. Just not sure if there is an easy way. Ideas?
[09:08:07] <bowenac> if I remove line 3 from that pastebin it will append  to the end of the textarea like I was saying... so if I had two items both items show in the textarea, then if I remove one it would show the two then 1
[09:10:47] <thebope> Hey everyone
[09:11:08] <thebope> Is there a way to see the currently stored javascript variables after a page has rendered without a break point?
[09:12:17] <MikeD_> i just want to confirm:  the scrollbars, favorites, toolbars, menu, etc. are collectively called "window chrome" right?  i can't google those terms anymore thanks to all the wrong connotations
[09:12:24] <exskoop> lol
[09:13:10] <exskoop> im doing "submit" event than i do $(this).serialize();  and i have no $_POST['myInputTypeSubmit'] availiable ? the rest i can reach...
[09:14:55] <exskoop> it ignores the type="submit" name="mySubmit"
[09:14:59] <exskoop> why ?
[09:16:04] <decx> najemnyvrah you split the string into an array, add whatever you want, and then join the array again
[09:17:49] <najemnyvrah> decx: sounds good. I'll try that. Thanx.
[09:19:31] <bowenac> apparently that is how append works I have to use .val and return
[09:20:37] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[09:21:08] <Vivekananda> used to have a friend here :) forgot his / her name though but have a question and kid of naive
[09:22:42] <thebope> ask away Vivekananda
[09:27:05] <zylophone> i have an array of objects with each contain a key called id. how do i get a list of id's which have a certain value?
[09:27:37] <sunbeam> how can I attach an on click for an <a> element  thats being added after page load ?
[09:27:47] <zylophone> or rather, i just want to check if a certain id value is contained in the objects
[09:27:55] <zylophone> sunbeam: .on
[09:29:38] <sunbeam> already used that
[09:29:51] <sunbeam> $(".icon").on('click'
[09:30:31] <decx> you can't add eventlisteners to something that doesn't exist on pageload (when the js is executed)
[09:30:32] <bowenac> so no one here has any ideas about append not working on a textarea after clearing the textarea using .val("");
[09:30:40] <zylophone> try wrapping that in a function, then calling that function when you add new items
[09:30:43] <decx> meaning you have to delegate your event from a parent
[09:31:02] <decx> $('#parentexistsonpageload').on('click','.icon',function(){})
[09:31:14] <zylophone> ahh
[09:31:47] <Vivekananda> sorry got cd
[09:33:22] <Vivekananda> hello thebope howdy :) and decx  too.. So my question. I have a jquery plugin and and got it to work mostly ( ie the flip ) but now am stuck. I want to make 'content' = GET 'myFile.php'  but not sure how to do this. my file is already all set with html code and some php.  here is the plugin link  http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[09:33:30] <zylophone> is it even possible to traverse the array like i want to without a .each?
[09:34:05] <thebope> Vivekananda, can you use ajax?
[09:34:07] <zylophone> Vivekananda: you mean like an ajax .GET?
[09:34:22] <thebope> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[09:34:39] <BillCriswell> zylophone: You can just use a for loop and grab them.
[09:34:42] <Vivekananda> thebope: I am exploring and honestly I dont know. The plugin page I linked to does not give the info. Please look at it.
[09:34:44] <BillCriswell> zylophone: or map
[09:35:27] <BillCriswell> zylophone: var ids = $.map( items, function(item){ return item.id; });
[09:35:30] <zylophone> BillCriswell: thanks, i think a map will be better
[09:35:33] <najemnyvrah> number = "1.2.3";
[09:35:33] <najemnyvrah> array = number.split(".");
[09:35:33] <najemnyvrah> var one =  parseInt(array[1])+1;
[09:35:35] <najemnyvrah> next = array[0] + '.'+ one + '.' + array[2];
[09:35:35] <zylophone> yeah
[09:35:37] <najemnyvrah> alert(next);
[09:35:47] <najemnyvrah> decx: like that ^^
[09:36:01] <BillCriswell> zylophone: If you're using undercore there's _.pluck(items, 'id');
[09:36:20] <decx> najemnyvrah http://jsfiddle.net/decx/tLQ7s/
[09:36:30] <thebope> Vivekananda, you will probably have to implement the jquery ajax functionality inside one of your flip functions
[09:37:37] <zylophone> BillCriswell: ohh underscore looks nice, i'll perhaps add it to my inventory ;)
[09:37:46] <najemnyvrah> decx: nice thanx
[09:38:10] <BillCriswell> zylophone: Yeah. Very useful.
[09:38:19] <Vivekananda> thebope: what does it mean when the author says :  content - define the new content of the flipped box. It works with: html, text or a jQuery object ex:$("selector").  can I use something like   content : function ( request, response){   ajax .... } ; ?
[09:38:36] <decx> there's also iterator if you want to traverse an object
[09:39:05] <thebope> Vivekananda, what does the php file do when it runs
[09:39:14] <Vivekananda> All I am hoping to do is to display an html page
[09:39:19] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zLTvZ/
[09:39:41] <Vivekananda> thebope: it is mostly an html file with just some images ( hence php used to display them ie echo them )
[09:41:07] <thebope> Vivekananda, I think you could add the ajax call in their then
[09:41:25] <thebope> Maybe try fooling around with a simple ajax call to an html element
[09:41:36] <thebope> and see if you can get a header with hello world in it to show or something
[09:41:43] <thebope> and then try it with the more complex php element
[09:42:55] <Vivekananda> thebope: yes you are right let me try that first. Although my question was
[09:43:49] <bowenac> alright thanks everyone I'll try another channel, figured this would be obvious to anyone who is good with jquery...
[09:44:10] <BillCriswell> You came to the wrong place.
[09:44:33] <thebope> Dodge City
[09:45:04] <BillCriswell> bowenac: What's your goal, appending to the current value of a textarea?
[09:45:37] <bowenac> I am clearing the value from the textarea, then re appending the values
[09:45:40] <Vivekananda> thebope: my question was I forgot how to write a proper  function(request, response) in jquery and wanted to look at an example to refresh my mem. I guess I will find one on stackoverflow. Btw
[09:45:55] <BillCriswell> appending "the values", what are "the values" and where do they come from?
[09:46:06] <zylophone> heh - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/ - the score for this is spinal tap goes up to 11!
[09:46:09] <Vivekananda> when I do content : function( request, response){} is the function creating an object ?
[09:46:14] <bowenac> I am removing an item from a wishlist, there is a contact form for inquiry, so if a user removes an item from the wishlist, I need to remove that item from the textarea then reappend the wishlist items etc
[09:46:30] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/F05apT31
[09:46:57] <bowenac> append does not work if you set the val to blank
[09:47:11] <BillCriswell> bowenac: You need to use val again.
[09:47:13] <bowenac> I found that out, but I guess a lot of people didn't know that
[09:47:16] <thebope> Vivekananda, http://kyleschaeffer.com/development/the-perfect-jquery-ajax-request/
[09:47:22] <thebope> that article looks like a good explanation
[09:47:27] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Just replace .append with .val
[09:47:46] <bowenac> yea I am trying to but I don't want the existing value but it won't work unless I use return value + which value ends up being undefined lol
[09:48:08] <BillCriswell> bowenac: That's not true.
[09:48:17] <BillCriswell> remove this line: $( "#message-contact-form" ).val('');
[09:48:25] <BillCriswell> replace this line: $( "#message-contact-form" ).append(name, " ", url, " ", sku, "&#13;&#10;");
[09:48:27] <bowenac> tried that didn't work has to be .val(function(index, value){return value + name + url + sku; });     it seems
[09:48:31] <BillCriswell> with this line $( "#message-contact-form" ).val(name, " ", url, " ", sku, "&#13;&#10;");
[09:48:52] <BillCriswell> bowenac: You confused someone who tried to help you previous.
[09:49:07] <bowenac> k
[09:49:23] <bowenac> I guess that makes more sense why clear it when I am setting the value
[09:49:41] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Actually. Wait.
[09:49:53] <BillCriswell> bowenac: I misunderstood your code.
[09:50:10] <BillCriswell> Build the string but don't set the value till you you're done the loop.
[09:50:19] <bowenac> yea that doesnt work haha
[09:50:45] <BillCriswell> bowenac: So like var value = ''; $.each(){ value += name; }; textarea.val(value);
[09:52:33] <BillCriswell> bowenac: http://jsbin.com/tumuroxi/1/edit?html,js,output very small demo.
[09:52:49] <Vivekananda> thebope: a kind of stupid question but why do we have things like success: sometihng rather than success = something. I want to know more about usage of  :  and syntax
[09:52:51] <BillCriswell> I used an array instead of a string but that'll work.
[09:53:33] <decx> that's just because it's in an object Vivekananda
[09:54:00] <BillCriswell> decx: Stop making up lies decx.
[09:54:16] <decx> not a lie if i believe it
[09:54:25] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:54:29] <decx> like var blah = 'blah'; var blah2 = { underblah: 'yes', no: 'yes' }
[09:55:12] <BillCriswell> decx: That's some sexy codin'
[09:55:26] <decx> more like object tit-eral amirite
[09:55:43] <BillCriswell> I have no idea, but probably.
[09:56:48] <Vivekananda> hmmm
[10:00:06] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Your nick sounds like a bad ass, sexy snake.
[10:00:39] <Jattenalle> or a pharmaceutical
[10:00:46] <Vivekananda> it actually is a quite a revered monk from INdia
[10:01:13] <Jattenalle> "Having problems with your thingstuff? Get Vivekananda! 'I use Vivekananda, and it sure helped me!'-Testimonial"
[10:01:19] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Really? Wayyyyyy off.
[10:01:46] <BillCriswell> 5 syllables is no joke.
[10:01:57] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivekananda
[10:02:05] <decx> i thought it was something that french canadians say
[10:02:26] <Jattenalle> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivekananda he was a key figure to introducing Yoga to the west, apparently
[10:02:29] <BillCriswell> I'm saying I was way off incase that wasn't clear. I'll read up haha.
[10:02:45] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Well, that brings him down like 20 cool points.
[10:02:56] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, you forget.. yoga pants.. <3
[10:03:00] <Vivekananda> oww lol why is that ?
[10:03:00] <BillCriswell> Luckily his name alone gave him like 1000
[10:03:06] <BillCriswell> ok he got that 20 back!
[10:03:33] <Jattenalle> whoa, he died at age 39
[10:03:49] <Vivekananda> yep
[10:03:55] <BillCriswell> That's a bummer.
[10:04:01] <Jattenalle> while meditating..
[10:04:03] <Jattenalle> badass
[10:04:20] <Vivekananda> lol did quite a bit in that short period though.
[10:04:47] <Vivekananda> but not like ISKON who are , the bad or worse part of our side of the story
[10:04:59] <Vivekananda> but apparentely the more widely known people
[10:05:05] <Jattenalle> though, i'm a bit disappointed in his lazy prophecy
[10:05:06] <Jattenalle> "Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years."
[10:05:21] <Jattenalle> i mean, the day before your 40th, you just off yourself, prophecy is true!
[10:05:53] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Is the death section confusing to you as well?
[10:06:03] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, it's horribly written, yes.
[10:06:25] <Jattenalle> (Like ( a lot) of this, stuff (maybe). Formating)
[10:06:32] <Jattenalle> either way, i feel educated, and i learned something new today, thank you Vivekananda
[10:06:48] <BillCriswell> "the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death" Can that just happen?
[10:07:07] <Jattenalle> it's called an aneurysm
[10:07:11] <Jattenalle> and yeah
[10:07:13] <Jattenalle> shit's scary
[10:07:39] <Vivekananda> this is what I am trying and blank response although the flip does go through --- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/252778c5dcb0d173ece2
[10:07:46] <decx> that's what happens if you don't extend your ring finger when you do the penguin stance
[10:07:59] <beancurd> rapture
[10:08:27] <Vivekananda> decx: lol kung fu panda
[10:08:33] <bowenac> BillCriswell thanks that kind of worked but for some reason when I remove one it does append the correct values but above and below I get undefined... with this http://pastebin.com/s3z96Kge
[10:09:09] <BillCriswell> bowenac: You should be setting up the demos at jsfiddle. pastebin belongs in the wastebin.
[10:09:32] <Vivekananda> so anyone comment on what how should I write the part ---   content : $.get('test2.php').  I can see in firebug that I AM getting a response just that it is nt showing up
[10:10:01] <bowenac> yea, a lot of this is coming from a plugin and php etc... it would be a pain to recreate a fiddle but I'll try if I can't get this sorted in a min
[10:11:04] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Where are the docs for this plugin?
[10:11:57] <bowenac> assuming its grabbing the value after clearing... since there is a empty line above and below the value before removing an item...
[10:12:48] <Vivekananda> the entire link is here
[10:12:58] <Vivekananda> http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[10:14:14] <BillCriswell> bowenac: http://jsbin.com/tumuroxi/2/edit?html,js,output does this help?
[10:17:05] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: There's only one flipbox, right?
[10:18:04] <Vivekananda> yes and it flips fine
[10:18:34] <bowenac> no does the same thing
[10:18:54] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: http://pastie.org/pastes/9182355/text this can be a work around.
[10:19:14] <bowenac> I end up with this http://pastebin.com/RBV6b0P7
[10:19:36] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: http://pastie.org/pastes/9182361/text is more up to date actually.
[10:19:55] <Vivekananda> also BillCriswell I found that if I do --  content : '<body> Hello world </body> '   this also works and ONLY   Hello world  is displayed but neither   1.  content : $.get("test2.php")  nor     2. content : ' $.get("test2.php")'  works
[10:20:28] <bowenac> BillCriswell its because the text area has the space at the beginning and end of the content
[10:20:33] <bowenac> probably from my first append
[10:20:36] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Yeah, you're giving a promise when you should be giving it a string.
[10:21:07] <Vivekananda> promise ?
[10:21:26] <BillCriswell> Well, a defered. $.get('foo.txt') does not return a string.
[10:21:47] <BillCriswell> I think I meant promise. I mix up terminology a lot.
[10:21:49] <bberry> BillCriswell, decx : this is what i came up with http://jsfiddle.net/AKcJW/1/
[10:21:53] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: also the author says that --   content  define the new content of the flipped box. It works with: html, text or a jQuery object ex:$("selector")   ie it should work with an object
[10:22:03] <Vivekananda> I was trying to give it one by doint  $.get()
[10:22:17] <bberry> BillCriswell, decx: it has my project specific stuff in there, but you get the idea :P
[10:22:44] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: That's not a jQuery object.
[10:22:46] <bberry> oh shoot, forgot to clear the text XD
[10:22:58] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: http://pastie.org/pastes/9182361/text did you see this link?
[10:23:08] <thebope> Vivekananda, sorry, lunch
[10:24:00] <bberry> decx, BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/AKcJW/2/
[10:24:17] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: okay yes saw it. I am guessing I have to put this code inside the document. ready() function isnt it ?
[10:24:42] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Yes, unless you load it after the document is ready.
[10:25:11] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: What is in test.php that can't be loaded in the document on load?
[10:26:09] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: let me try that and then I will get back to you with two more questions   ( it can be loaded on load no worries ) .  1.  what is the default data type obtained using the $.get()  and   2.  how do convert it to a string
[10:26:16] <Vivekananda> but letme first try this
[10:26:16] <BillCriswell> bowenac: I would need to see the rest of your code. My guess is you're adding to a string that wasn't initiated properly.
[10:26:23] <bowenac> BillCriswell I used your code instead of appending to get the first values before someone removes etc. And it adds a space to the beginning of the text area
[10:26:49] <BillCriswell> bowenac: You must be doing liek " " + value or some shit.
[10:28:19] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Seriously just grab the outputted HTML, narrow it down to the necessities and post it to jsfiddle or jsbin
[10:29:02] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: You can't really "change" it to a string. AJAX is async, so you need to run something when it's ready.
[10:30:31] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: how about using the .done() function and then changing the obtained value into string
[10:30:35] <Vivekananda> that should work right ?
[10:31:37] * BillCriswell is upset decx didn't notice the wastebin joke.
[10:31:41] <crash1hd> whats wrong with this? $( ".formulaBox span" ).css({"background-color":$(this).parent().css("background-color")})
[10:31:58] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: What do you think `this` is?
[10:32:16] <decx> sorry bill i'm busy
[10:32:32] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: The result of the done callback is a string.
[10:33:25] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: The code I gave you is the only way I could see doing it in a sane matter.
[10:33:49] <Vivekananda> it works fine thanks but if done callback is a string
[10:33:50] <BillCriswell> decx: I guess you're allowed to be once a month.
[10:33:57] <Vivekananda> then that should work equally well too isnt it ?
[10:34:22] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: It's not returned though.
[10:35:07] <Vivekananda> you mean I cannot do something like  $.ajax().done(data){content: data}  ?
[10:35:23] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Yes, that's essentially what I'm doing.
[10:35:24] <Vivekananda> sorry  you mean I cannot do something like  $.ajax(){}.done(data){content: data}  ?
[10:35:32] <Vivekananda> okay yes thanks
[10:35:44] <BillCriswell> I thought you were thinking { content: $.get('foo').done() }
[10:36:10] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:36:27] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Also, you might have white space in your HTML.
[10:37:06] <Vivekananda> yes that is what I want thinking to do  --   { content: $.get('foo').done() }   . Will this not work ?
[10:37:10] <Vivekananda> your method does work
[10:37:38] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: It will not work.
[10:38:11] <bberry> So no comments on the alert thingy i did? i'm going to assume that its perfect :P
[10:38:13] <bowenac> BillCriswell its something with my append http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/C2Dt3/1/
[10:40:29] <bowenac> If I remove the " " after each var it doesn't add the space to the  beginning but I don't get why its doing that to the beginning of the first var when I don't have " "
[10:42:30] <bowenac> If I use .append(name,url,sku); it doesn't add the space to the beginning of the textarea but if I use .append(name," ",url," ",sku);  it does
[10:45:08] <il> is it considered good practice to put colons after these?: });
[10:45:15] <il> I think they look cooler like this: })
[10:46:42] <karangoel> i do put the colons just for consistency
[10:46:58] <BillCriswell> bowenac: http://jsfiddle.net/C2Dt3/3/ this will help you debug it.
[10:47:41] <Vasa> when i do this.id is this cross browser?
[10:48:02] <Vasa> or is $(this).attr('id') better approach
[10:48:19] <BillCriswell> Vasa: That's safe I think.
[10:48:26] <Vasa> thank you
[10:52:34] <bowenac> thanks BillCriswell yea it seems to be running through an extra time...
[10:53:08] <bowenac> man  I am an idiot haha its because of the header column lol
[10:53:21] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Happens.
[10:53:24] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: thanks again. I am trying to do one last thing to the code you gave me and that is to flip back ie revert. on the page itself the author gives -    There's an "hidden" method called revertFlip: as it says, revert a flip to the previous state   --  $("#flipbox").revertFlip()  .  I am trying this  now ---   https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/252778c5dcb0d173ece2     but again does not work
[10:53:51] <bowenac> I didn't write the contact form why wouldnt they use th
[10:53:53] <Vivekananda> I do remember that this was a problem in jquery , js and quite a pain to give a Dynamic button some function
[10:53:55] <bowenac> I need to use tbody tr
[10:54:15] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: is #revertButton in the content loaded by .get?
[10:54:35] <Vivekananda> yes as you seen in the test page on the gist ( box 2 )
[10:54:46] <BillCriswell> I didn't scroll down that far haha.
[10:55:07] <Vivekananda> lol
[10:55:27] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Ok, so you can do $(document).on('click', '#revertButton', function(){ ... });
[10:55:32] <Vivekananda> okay but I remember that this is usally a problem for jquery / js to assing functions to on the fly button
[10:56:08] <Vivekananda> where do I put this code ? inside the document.ready() itself or outside it ?
[10:56:20] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Yeah, that problem is usually due to people not having a full understanding of things.
[10:56:22] <Vivekananda> and is it just 'document' or should I put some name
[10:56:50] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Just document is fine, but if that flipper it in a div might be better to use that.
[10:56:53] <Vivekananda> I remember reading about it and I believe I understood that since the button is not yet loaded so the on ready wont work
[10:57:02] <bowenac> hmmm now another problem for the bottom one, and they all have unique id's but the bottom one does not so not sure how I can target just the tr that have an id tag
[10:57:05] <Vivekananda> yes it is in a div
[10:57:22] <Vivekananda> and is nested too !!!
[10:57:25] <Vivekananda> that should help
[10:57:35] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: So you can do like $('#that-div').on('click', '.whatever') instead of $(document).on('click', '.whatever')
[10:57:39] <Vivekananda> but where do I put it ?  inside the .ready () or out side t ?
[10:57:55] <BillCriswell> Whatever that current code you have is.
[10:58:04] <Vivekananda> okay lemme try
[11:04:04] <bowenac> BillCriswell I got it working, I added a class to each tr .hasitem then when I do the remove I used $(this).parent('tr').removeClass("hasitem"); then only target the tr's that has the class .hasitem
[11:04:07] <bowenac> thanks for the help
[11:04:40] <BillCriswell> bowenac: No problem.
[11:13:01] <crash1hd> anyone know why $(this) inside .css("background-color") doesnt work
[11:13:24] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: What are you expecting `this` to be?
[11:13:35] <crash1hd> 		$( "input[name='"+args.Field+"']:eq("+((args.RowID)-1)+")" ).siblings("span").css({"background-color":($(this).parent().parent().css("background-color"))}).click(function(){
[11:13:57] <crash1hd> if I console log the $(this).parent().parent() it returns with the td
[11:14:11] <crash1hd> and if I added the .css("background-color") it returns the right color
[11:14:17] <crash1hd> but the color does not update
[11:14:28] <crash1hd> if I change it to a each it works
[11:14:44] <crash1hd> if I put the .css("background-color") inside the click it works
[11:14:53] <crash1hd> just not sure why it doesnt work above
[11:14:59] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: this would be defined outside of that.
[11:15:34] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: just console.log( this ); and make sure it's what you think it is.
[11:15:48] <crash1hd> it comes back correct inside the click
[11:16:59] <BillCriswell> The this inside click and the this you're using in your .css wouldn't be the same thing.
[11:17:12] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: Can you set up a demo at jsfiddle.net or jsbin.net ?
[11:17:21] <crash1hd> so how do I console log the one inside the .css
[11:17:30] <crash1hd> $( "input[name='"+args.Field+"']:eq("+((args.RowID)-1)+")" ).siblings("span").css({"background-color":($( "input[name='"+args.Field+"']:eq("+((args.RowID)-1)+")" ).siblings("span").parent().parent().css("background-color"))}).click(function(){
[11:17:30] <crash1hd> 		 works
[11:17:51] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: Put console.log(this) on the line above it.
[11:18:16] <crash1hd> on the line above the .click?
[11:18:32] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:18:40] <crash1hd> its going to return undefined
[11:18:59] <crash1hd> as its outside the selector
[11:21:37] <BillCriswell> $('li').css('background-color', $(this).text()); What do you think `this` is in the example here?
[11:22:22] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: I got the flip to work but now it works just once ie it flips forward then reverts back but if I want to flip AGAIN it does not . I included a copy of the two functions  a little altered  out side of the ready too and assumed that would do the trick but it does not  :(.     https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/a8643889c7ac09743676
[11:26:27] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: I need a demo to look at this. Entirely too lazy.
[11:26:55] <Vivekananda> hmm so I can create one but just a couple of things
[11:27:09] <Vivekananda> first how do I include custom js files in the demo
[11:27:42] <Vivekananda> is it possible to upload those in js fiddle and include them in the html
[11:27:56] <BillCriswell> No, you need to give a full url.
[11:30:34] <Vivekananda> but that is not possible as the files are not hosted online :(
[11:30:44] <Vivekananda> how do I create a fiddle !
[11:30:49] <BillCriswell> <script> src of file </script>
[11:30:56] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: You have to figure that part out.
[11:31:11] <Vivekananda> okay
[11:31:38] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: $('li').css('background-color', $(this).text()); What do you think `this` is in the example here?
[11:32:05] <crash1hd> should be the li
[11:32:36] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: Nope.
[11:32:41] <rethus> i have this entry in my menu: <a href="#" class="xst_bs3_mainNav_01-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".xst_bs3_mainNav_01-nav">
[11:33:04] <crash1hd> $(this) refers to the object that I am currently working with no?
[11:33:12] <crash1hd> $('li') is that object
[11:33:14] <decx> BillCriswell it's not but it should be, as $(this) works just fine in a function
[11:33:29] <rethus> if i shrink the screen, this is the Button to open the navigation on mobile-apps.
[11:33:35] <decx> crash1hd $('li').css('background-color', function(){ return $(this).text() });
[11:33:42] <rethus> but if i click on it, the page is reloaded
[11:33:50] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: this is whatever the parent scopes this is.
[11:33:55] <BillCriswell> in that example.
[11:34:09] <BillCriswell> The one decx just showed you would work, though.
[11:34:48] <crash1hd> So you are saying that $(this) in your example referes to the parent of $('li')?
[11:35:10] <decx> no it would apply to document
[11:35:13] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: No, $(this) in my first example would be the window actually.
[11:35:15] <decx> if it's in a document ready
[11:35:24] <BillCriswell> or maybe document haha
[11:36:09] <crash1hd> ok so the this in my case is it the document or the div? that contains the span
[11:36:30] <BillCriswell> decx: I think it is window.
[11:36:30] <decx> no that doesnt have anything to do with it
[11:37:02] <decx> if you put in in window onload it's window, if you put it in docready is document BillCriswell ;)
[11:37:18] <decx> without any scope it's probably window?
[11:37:27] <decx> ye
[11:37:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Ahhh, got it.
[11:38:12] <BillCriswell> decx: So if you just put your code before the </body> it's window, but in a doc ready it's document.
[11:38:38] <decx> that's probably something with crossbrowser headaches
[11:38:44] <BillCriswell> decx: Hm
[11:42:46] <decx> maybe not, it's always window unless its docready
[11:43:43] <BillCriswell> decx: We can chock it up to voodoo.
[11:44:02] <nerdin> is there a way to convert px to pt easily with jquery?
[11:45:35] <BillCriswell> nerdin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/139655/convert-pixels-to-points
[11:46:15] <nerdin> thanks
[11:49:21] <crash1hd> thank you :)
[11:51:28] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: No problem!
[11:52:21] <crash1hd> I really would have thought the $(this) would return itself not the window but it does make sense
[12:00:04] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: Yeah I remember trying the same thing in the past.
[12:00:29] <crash1hd> :)
[12:00:31] <BillCriswell> Someone explained it to me, probably a lot better than my attempt to you haha
[12:00:48] <crash1hd> didnt know I could do a function inside tho either lol :) so learned 2 things
[12:01:49] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: I put a onclick on the button itself on html and that solves all issues but sadly does not allow me to learn anything of why it wont work using jquery
[12:02:50] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: The function thing really comes in handy when you're working with collections of things.
[12:03:06] <crash1hd> no doubt
[12:03:40] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: I'd have to see everything in action.
[12:03:44] <decx> too bad it'S 3x slower
[12:06:32] <Vivekananda> let me try setting up a fiddle
[12:06:52] <dinho> how can I make this opens and closes the page appears closed?  http://tamand.com.br/~labscom/fale-conosco/  http://jsfiddle.net/5s5Vt/
[12:07:19] <dinho> now is open
[12:08:24] <dinho> must appear closed to open the page
[12:11:24] <dinho> http://jsfiddle.net/5s5Vt/1/
[12:12:00] <dinho> now works up and down. how can I leave closed when entering the site?
[12:15:12] <dinho> http://jsfiddle.net/5s5Vt/2/
[12:15:38] <dinho> is there any way to leave it closed to enter the page?
[12:41:10] <dinho> here results
[12:41:12] <dinho> http://tamand.com.br/~labscom/fale-conosco/
[12:49:58] <drej> anyone know a vanilla js approach to getting .parents(); fuciont?
[12:50:00] <drej> function*
[13:01:51] <BillCriswell> drej: You could loop through .parentNode till you hit the end maybe?
[13:02:02] <drej> yeah, thats what i think i have to do
[13:02:25] <BillCriswell> Whenever I write something that may infinite loop, it infinite loops.
[13:02:38] <drej> that's gotta be a law
[13:03:39] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: around ?
[13:03:56] <Vivekananda> set up this demo but the stupid thing is not working am checking it http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hW85Y/4/
[13:05:55] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: There's an error.
[13:09:18] <Vivekananda> have to check in firebug it seems
[13:13:47] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: it says that logFlip() is not defined but I have put it at the bottom on the js . Have I placed it incorrectly ?
[13:15:53] <da3m0n22> Hi, using AnythingSlider, when onSlideComplete adds hashtag to URL, it cancels current navigation
[13:16:05] <da3m0n22> anyone has the same problem?
[13:16:26] <da3m0n22> (solved by turning off hashtags, in initialization code `hashTags: false`)

[13:19:12] <sophdes> Hi everyone! Wondering if anyone here can lend me their expertise with a problem I am running into with show/hide multiple divs?
[13:29:48] <sophdes> http://jsfiddle.net/keriboyer/S2EGq/ Looking for a way to click on the red product category DIV to expand the hidden product information. With my current markup, is there any way to relationally target the div (ie. parent, child, etc)?
[13:33:20] <quantalrabbit> I'm selecting a bunch of span's such as follows:  $('span.myclass') .  What i want is to transform the result into an array of what is between the span tags.  Is there an easy way to go about this?
[13:45:32] <gnarf> sophdes: first off - ID is supposed to be unique
[13:45:41] <gnarf> you have a bunch of things with the same id, they should be a class
[13:49:41] <gnarf> sophdes: http://jsfiddle.net/S2EGq/3/ - i had to change some things to be classes
[13:56:03] <brunoais> decx, Hey
[13:56:06] <brunoais> sorry about the delay
[13:56:11] <brunoais> http://brunoaisserver.dtdns.net/provingIt.php
[13:56:21] <brunoais> decx, is this a "normal" size?
[14:03:45] <dmoreno> There are any program to do unit test on jquery?
[14:04:01] <Jon47> dmoreno:  jquery itself uses qunit i believe
[14:04:15] <Jon47> so you could start by looking there, but i'm sure there are other options as well
[14:11:37] <sophdes> gnarf -- Thank you so much! That works beautifully!
[15:28:59] <decx> brunoais i'm not cork :>
[15:31:00] <nhulea> let pop this bottlew !!
[15:31:03] <nhulea> bottle
[15:31:27] <naeluh_cork> I am cork !!
[15:33:27] <tw2113> no i'm cork
[15:57:26] <naeluh_cork> iam pretty sure my name says cork
[15:58:20] <tw2113> a name is just another way to label

[16:32:50] <dcorbin_>     var gl = document.getElementById('gameList')
[16:32:51] <dcorbin_>     var x = $("#gameList")
[16:32:51] <dcorbin_> I'm must be missing something really basic.   Wouldn't you expect both x1 and x2 in this fragment to be the same? https://gist.github.com/dcorbin/8f4d97d9a2d6c09d8551
[16:33:19] <dcorbin_> oops.  Skip the code above, ust look at the gist, please.
[16:40:52] <shoky> dcorbin_: one is a DOM element, the other is a DOM element wrapped in a jquery object
[16:45:44] <guzzlefry> What's the cleanest way to have all links on a page open in a new tab?
[16:47:23] <guzzlefry> $(document).ready(function() { $('a').attr('target', '_blank');}); ?
[16:56:25] <dcorbin_> shoky.  Ah.  much thanks.
[17:32:11] <foo> I want to load an image on page 1 that gets called on page 2, I want to load it at end of page 1 so it loads quickly on page 2. How can I do this? Hmm
[17:38:41] <BillCriswell> foo: Just load the image and it should be cached.
[17:39:57] <BillCriswell> foo: You could do it in CSS or just hide it in the HTML.
[17:47:33] <foo> BillCriswell: good point, hmm, guess I could just do that
[17:53:21] <Vivekananda> anyone around
[17:54:23] <Vivekananda> I have two fiddles one works the other doesnt I want to learn why it doesnt. This has to do with  giving dynamic element ( button here ) some jquery functionality but it does not work !
[18:06:32] <joobie> hey guys, is there a way in firebug (or similar program) to identify which JS is running in realtime? like to capture the JS that runs when you click a button, etc..
[18:13:56] <CrispyClean> Can some one help be pass in a parameter on click? http://jsfiddle.net/DGGZ/zFDS5/9/
[18:14:18] <CrispyClean> Iâ€™m pretty burnt and this code is doing nothing -_-
[18:16:11] <BillCriswell> CrispyClean: You can't use the same id twice and you shouldn't create your own attributes. Also, there's a syntax error.
[18:17:51] <CrispyClean> BillCriswell: ok I was trying to avoid creating multiple click functionsâ€¦ i guess no way around it?
[18:18:21] <BillCriswell> CrispyClean: You would use a class and set a data-attribute.
[18:18:33] <BillCriswell> CrispyClean: http://jsfiddle.net/zFDS5/11/
[18:18:35] <decx> change id to class, add data- prefix for your attributes, add a ) at the end and you're done
[18:18:59] <CrispyClean> :-D just saw that â€œ)â€ thx guys
[18:19:29] <CrispyClean> awesome BillCriswell !!!
[18:19:37] <CrispyClean> thanks!
[18:19:42] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:29:56] <gry> how do I get a "screenshot" of an html element? I want to take a picture and save it to file
[18:30:10] <gry> specifically a picture of a player embed
[18:31:24] <BillCriswell> gry: Programmatically or like... just for you to do real quick?
[18:37:17] <gry> BillCriswell, programatically
[18:37:42] <BillCriswell> Oh... no idea how to approach that one.
[18:38:22] <jphase> gry: I'd suggest looking into wkhtmltopdf
[18:39:36] <BillCriswell> gry: http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/examples.html
[18:40:20] <BillCriswell> This demo page is terrible but it works pretty well.
[18:40:26] <decx> 90kb lib for a screenshot?
[18:40:54] <gry> is that a lot?
[18:41:10] <BillCriswell> decx: You can't party with less than 90kbs.
[18:42:20] <decx> if you don't build an app around the fact of making html into images then you don't need a canvas html parser
[18:42:27] <decx> :>
[18:42:36] <decx> what are you embedding?
[18:47:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Working on anything good?
[18:48:11] <decx> yeah right
[18:48:28] <BillCriswell> decx: I feel like wasted talent haha
[18:48:28] <decx> i'm working on my buzz and contemplate bed
[18:48:35] <BillCriswell> decx: HAhaha
[18:48:38] <BillCriswell> What time is it there?
[18:48:48] <decx> [03:48:37] < BillCriswell> What time is it there?
[18:48:58] <BillCriswell> Geeze.
[18:49:01] <decx> i've been clicking at clouds for like 20 minutes
[18:49:10] <BillCriswell> Windows wall paper?
[18:49:12] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mfpqY/
[18:51:56] <BillCriswell> decx: All I see is this: http://i.imgur.com/Wha1NQy.png
[18:52:21] <decx> still a better ending than lost
[18:52:29] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[18:52:33] <decx> everyone dies either way
[18:52:39] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:52:51] <BillCriswell> I love that show.
[18:54:01] <decx> well i was looking for something to watch anyway
[18:54:05] <decx> might aswell
[18:54:35] <BillCriswell> decx: Oh you never saw it? How do you know they all die at the end? haha
[18:55:10] <decx> i'm in the right state of mind to watch a show with puppets
[18:55:19] <BillCriswell> Good.
[18:55:33] <jphase>  oooo I remember that ol' show
[18:55:33] <decx> and it's like what. 5 clicks away
[18:55:48] <decx> it really is the future
[18:56:06] <decx> i have a pizza for which i don't have to preheat the oven and it's still good
[18:56:29] <BillCriswell> decx: "Changing Nature" was the last episode aired. They all die.
[18:56:43] <BillCriswell> jphase: That's my go to show when I'm bored
[18:56:50] <decx> i know, i watched that like 20 years ago
[18:57:04] <BillCriswell> Oh haha
[18:57:51] <decx> i thought i was exaggerating but that's not that far off
[18:57:56] <jphase> that creepy lil' dinosaur baby always made me laugh
[18:57:57] <decx> yikes
[18:58:20] <jphase> fat babies are a good source of amusement
[18:58:31] <jphase> dinosaur or otherwise
[18:58:33] <BillCriswell> jphase: As a kid he's all I remember. Watching it now he's really not in it as much as I thoguht.
[18:58:48] <jphase> I might have to revisit that show
[18:59:18] <BillCriswell> I can't believe the episode "The Greatest Story Ever Sold" actually aired on TV.
[18:59:24] <BillCriswell> Pretty ballsy for the time.
[19:00:49] <BillCriswell> "The Last Temptation of Ethyl" is a good one as well.
[19:01:21] <decx> ill just start at 101
[19:03:31] <BillCriswell> "When the Baby asks Earl where dinosaurs came from and why, the questions are repeated throughout all Pangea and raise a panic; until the chief elders declare all questions can be answered by their newfound religion: Potato-ism."
[19:04:32] * jphase hands BillCriswell a steamy russet
[19:05:17] <BillCriswell> I just has mashed potatoes and steak actually.
[19:05:27] <jphase> yummmm
[19:05:52] <jphase> I am on of the select few that likes blue potatoes
[19:05:59] <jphase> om nom
[19:07:00] <BillCriswell> Never even knew they came in that color.
[19:09:01] <jphase> https://www.google.com/search?q=blue+potatoes&espv=2&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=mcR2U8aBEpCIqgazkYGABw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=910
[19:09:04] <jphase> booya
[19:10:33] <decx> i never noticed it, but the trex looks like ryan stiles
[19:11:06] <BillCriswell> decx: I agree. Same personality.
[19:11:13] <BillCriswell> jphase: They're cool looking.
[19:11:19] <BillCriswell> I might need to try one.
[19:11:56] <jphase> like a red potato and a beet had a love child
[19:12:09] <BillCriswell> I never ate a beet.
[19:12:18] <BillCriswell> I only even probably heard of it from Doug.
[19:13:22] <jphase> beets are good but make you think you're pooping blood - have remember you ate one
[19:13:41] <jphase> </graphic>
[19:15:27] <BillCriswell> jphase: Haha well good to know
[19:15:40] <BillCriswell> Hopefully they come with a warning for that.
[19:15:56] <shibato> okay.. i'm pretty lost on what to do: I have 4 elements with different heights. For each element down the list, it'll add the height of the previous elements in the list. what should I be trying here? http://jsfiddle.net/bvEj7/
[19:17:20] <jphase> shibato: are you trying to equalize the height between the elements?
[19:19:05] <jphase> shibato: if you want to make them all equal (based on the heighest/widest element) then I wrote a blog post about this since many -a- folk ask this:  http://robido.com/blog/jquery/jquery-equalize-height-or-width-of-elements-make-same-uniform-height-or-width/
[19:19:18] <shibato> jphase nope, I want the elements to still have different heights, but trying to get a total height count of each element + the previous height of each elements in the list
[19:19:23] <jphase> oh
[19:19:57] <BillCriswell> shibato: http://jsfiddle.net/bvEj7/2/ ?
[19:20:00] <shibato> I currently have it as a ton of different variables.. but i figured there had to be a better way with a loop or something
[19:20:08] <jphase> well it'd be similar, you'd just initialize a variable = 0; then loop through each and add their height
[19:20:39] <jphase> precisely what BillCriswell showed you
[19:20:41] <BillCriswell> shibato: Blah, http://jsfiddle.net/bvEj7/3/
[19:20:49] <jphase> either way looping through them
[19:21:20] <decx> what?
[19:21:49] <BillCriswell> what?
[19:21:59] <jphase> eh?
[19:21:59] <decx> when would that be applicable?
[19:22:14] <decx> isnt this about getting the height of all elements in one var?
[19:22:21] <BillCriswell> decx: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[19:22:53] <decx> we might never find out
[19:22:54] <BillCriswell> decx: I thought they wanted to add the height of the previous div to the height of the current div.
[19:23:09] <decx> well yeah that's what he wrote, but that seems ridiculous
[19:23:13] <shibato> BillCriswell I kinda get how you did that, but how do I assign each to a different variable? The idea is to make it so that I have new variables: apple1height = 50, apple2height = 120, etc
[19:23:45] <shibato> i'm trying to generate a list of the variables with the heights, but not actually change the height of each element
[19:23:55] <BillCriswell> shibato: Use an array.
[19:23:59] <jphase> shibato: use .push?
[19:24:03] <jphase> ^
[19:26:23] <BillCriswell> shibato: http://jsfiddle.net/bvEj7/4/ like this?
[19:28:45] <BillCriswell> Not sure if you want the new height added to the height of the next or the current height.
[19:31:02] <shibato> BillCriswell I'm trying to make a list of new heights but not change any elements yet so the array makes sense..just not sure how to assign it to variables. Basically, I wanted to create variables on the fly for each of the items in the list
[19:31:42] <shibato> so I'd end up with 4 variables, apple1height, apple2height, apple3height, apple4height and apple1height = height of apple1, apple2height = height of apple2 + height of apple1, etc.
[19:31:49] <shibato> and the elements wouldn't be changed
[19:32:47] <shibato> the way I have it right now- I have just a huge list of variables- apple1height = apple1.height(), apple2height = apple2.height() + apple.height(), etc so it's a mess to read
[19:33:07] <shibato> I think my biggest problem is generating the variables on the fly and assigning the new height to that variable
[19:34:00] <BillCriswell> shibato: newHeights = [ 50, 70, 80, 20 ].map(function(n, i, a) { return n + ( a[i - 1] || 0 ); }); should do it.
[19:36:46] <BillCriswell> n is the current number, i is the index of the number and a is the original array.
[19:38:56] <BillCriswell> shibato: http://jsbin.com/lifihema/2/edit?js quick demo
[19:39:34] <inDux> Hey hi, is this where all the jquery experts hang out?
[19:40:20] <BillCriswell> inDux: If by experts you mean not very terrible, yes.
[19:40:41] <inDux> BillCriswell: haha yes the honest devs
[19:41:15] <inDux> Think I may have bit off more than I can chew. Iâ€™m trying to create a dynamic formâ€¦add/delete form inputs
[19:41:36] <inDux> and transform regular text to text input via a toggle()
[19:41:46] <inDux> Iâ€™m stuck on the later
[19:42:06] <shibato> BillCriswell yeah it works- i'm just trying to understand each line. Trying to make it so that that each increment div would add the height of ALL the previous heights but having trouble understanding the code still
[19:42:26] <BillCriswell> shibato: Do you want to end up with one number?
[19:43:08] <shibato> Nope, 4 different numbers, but var2 = height of 1+ 2, var 3 = 1+2+3, etc
[19:43:10] <BillCriswell> inDux: Why isn't it an input off bat?
[19:43:40] <shibato> Right now your code works well, but it only adds the previous height in the list which is something i shouldve clarified
[19:44:02] <inDux> BillCriswell: multiple parties are editing one form. I want just one â€˜editâ€™ button to change the text into a form
[19:48:22] <tw2113> Cork, got a command for you to run in osx terminal :D say "Cork, you're my hero"
[19:48:32] <jphase> lol
[19:49:50] <BillCriswell> shibato: Do you need the original heights?
[19:49:56] <BillCriswell> inDux: What have you tried so far?
[19:50:45] <BillCriswell> shibato: http://jsbin.com/lifihema/5/edit?js,output can do it for you
[19:51:48] <shibato> BillCriswell don't need the original heights, but in your example, the final output should be [50, 120, 200, 220] http://jsbin.com/lifihema/2/edit
[19:52:12] <inDux> BillCriswell: All of the text that needs to transform into <input type=â€˜text /> boxes are in a span class: .dynamic-text-input
[19:52:32] <BillCriswell> shibato: It is.
[19:53:01] <inDux> BillCriswell: Iâ€™m trying to iterate through them and then add html to them
[19:53:09] <BillCriswell> and you only want them to be inputs after you click edit or can they be the whole time?
[19:54:00] <shibato> BillCriswelll just saw the new link- i don't know how you come up with this stuff so easily. It's perfect. Thanks a ton!
[19:54:21] <BillCriswell> shibato: No problem. Is that a little easier to follow than the map example?
[19:54:32] <gry> decx: I am embedding a movie player, need screenshot for user to select movie cover
[19:55:08] <shibato> BillCriswell yeah a lot easier. I can actually understand that- I didn't even know .map() existed but again, that's not saying much since I'm pretty new to jquery
[19:55:32] <gry> decx: I'd be somewhat happy if a file manager did that, as all files are in one directory, but it appears to be unreasonably unfriendly, such as with the too-small thumbnails
[19:55:43] <BillCriswell> shibato: That .map is just plain javascript. jQuery has it's own that does the same thing though.
[19:56:08] <BillCriswell> inDux: What I'm trying to get at it would this approach be ok? You could skip the JS all together: http://jsbin.com/doduyiwe/1/edit?html,css,output
[19:56:35] <inDux> BillCriswell: Thatâ€™s perfect!
[19:56:51] <inDux> BillCriswell: thank you!
[19:56:56] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[19:59:31] <BillCriswell> inDux: http://jsbin.com/doduyiwe/1/edit feels a little smoother with a transparent border.
[20:00:16] <inDux> BillCriswell: Yea that looks great! I didnâ€™t realize css was this powerful
[20:00:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/doduyiwe/2/edit there you go, even fancier!
[20:01:14] <inDux> woah that fade
[20:02:46] <BillCriswell> A bit obnoxious, but when it's subtle it's great.
[20:12:08] <inDux> BillCriswell: totally agree
[20:12:47] <inDux> BillCriswell: Are you in philly by chance?
[20:13:18] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[20:13:49] <inDux> BillCriswell: Me too. Ucity
[20:13:52] <jphase> ooo, I sense a date coming on!
[20:13:56] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[20:14:09] * jphase nudges BillCriswell towards inDux
[20:14:27] <inDux> hahah donâ€™t make me blush
[20:14:37] <BillCriswell> I work in Society Hill. I live in the Burbs though.
[20:14:47] <jphase> ooo, he/she wears blush! date city!
[20:15:28] <jphase> so I must ask, how pissed does the geico gecko make you on that stupid cheesesteak song?
[20:15:51] <inDux> jphase: dude I hate the commerical
[20:15:58] <inDux> jphase: itâ€™s awful
[20:16:25] <jphase> it makes me embarrassed when I watch it so I can only imagine how horrible it is to the natives
[20:16:57] <BillCriswell> I just watched it without listening to it. It was pretty awful to watch.
[20:16:59] <inDux> geicoâ€™s based in chicago. They have no business with our steaks
[20:18:49] <jphase> yeah, their whole "look we're local to everywhere" campaign has pissed me off as far as commercials go
[20:19:18] <jphase> I'm waiting for a Portland, Oregon one to push me over the edge
[20:20:28] <BillCriswell> jphase: What would they ruin for Portland?
[20:20:50] <jphase> I'm sure they'll get creative.... probably something off of Portlandia
[20:21:12] <jphase> "weirdness" or thick rimmed glasses or bacon maple bars... idk
[20:21:49] <BillCriswell> Damn lizards ruining everything.
[20:23:15] <jphase> mmmm, speaking of doughnuts....
[20:24:00] <krept`> could someone help me with this ajax? http://hastebin.com/kalufodeja.xml
[20:24:22] <krept`> it's not resetting lastchecked variable correctly. or taking to long maybe between calls, and returning previous result maybe?
[20:25:01] <krept`> it returns the same post a couple times before performing correctly with new time
[20:25:14] <inDux> jphase: Trailblazed geico
[20:28:54] <deizel> .part
[20:29:55] <jphase> heh
[20:30:13] <jphase> our only team is so sad... at least they're getting better after several years
[20:30:18] <BillCriswell> krept`: Are you sure you can just pass a date object like that? That seems weird. Also, you can look at the dev console's "network" tab to see if it's caching.
[20:30:48] <krept`> Pass the object through ajax / php is odd, or that you can do it in the success function?
[20:31:09] <krept`> i know i can pass it on page load, that works, but doing it on click isn't working properly i don't think
[20:32:22] <krept`> hmm yeah it's sending the right times.
[20:34:54] <BillCriswell> krept`: I'm having a hard time following what you're going for.
[20:35:04] <krept`> ok no problem
[20:35:34] <krept`> basically i just send an ajax call to query my mysql database for any new posts since lastchecked.
[20:35:48] <krept`> lastchecked is set on page load, so that works fine
[20:35:53] <krept`> but then if i return a post, i can click to show new posts
[20:36:00] <krept`> like twitter does, or stack overflow
[20:36:26] <krept`> when i click, it shows new posts, but also resets the lastchecked time to right when it's clicked, that way it doesn't return the posts that you just loaded
[20:36:56] <krept`> i cant use 'now' for the time to send to the query, because it would never get anything newer than right now, so i just have to set it and let it sit and wait for new posts
[20:42:40] <inDux> Um has anyone ever seen a .click() gone rogue and submit a form when itâ€™s not told to?
[20:43:15] <krept`> told not to or not told to?
[21:17:19] <krept`> i was wrong, it's not resetting the variable correctly
[21:21:55] <krept`> had to get the time from a function
[21:24:40] <fattest> i'm trying to always show the black box infront of the character's face, should i use jquery for this or just plain css? http://jsbin.com/dujimilu/1/edit if i use background contain, the backgroud only covers 75%
[21:24:52] <fattest> how should i go about fixing this?
[23:30:24] <brunoais> decx, ups, wrong username
[23:30:35] <brunoais> Cork, Hey
