[00:04:30] <pootietang> I'm unable to load text locally, can someone help me with this? http://bit.ly/qYBGRv
[00:05:02] <waseem_> Lets say I create some elements like $('<li/>', {...}) in a loop. Inside this loop I keep pushing these newly created elements in an array. Now when I try to do $.fn.append(this_new_array) I get an error. Its because append expects an array of jQuery elements. But what I passed was an array of arrays of jQuery elements. https://gist.github.com/1258585
[00:05:31] <waseem_> How do I overcome Above?
[00:10:14] <pootietang> is there an example showing how to load html content using deffered?
[00:13:02] <waseem_> So I need to do $lis.push(li[0]) instead of $lis.push(li). But it feels unnecessary.
[00:26:09] <gnarf> ?ajax @pootietang
[00:26:09] <bot-t> pootietang, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[00:26:33] <gnarf> waseem_: huh? jQuery has a .push method?
[00:26:38] <gnarf> waseem_:  see ?.add
[00:26:38] <bot-t> waseem_, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[00:26:54] <gnarf> $lis = $lis.add( li )
[00:27:31] <gorkha> My problem seems to be fixet by using $.ajax instead of $.post and setting the dataType to html
[00:30:07] <virtualint> how to trigger a delegate live jquery event?
[00:31:32] <coldhead> virtualint: did you try trigger() ?
[00:31:39] <coldhead> ?trigger
[00:31:40] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[00:31:44] <virtualint> yes
[00:31:47] <virtualint> no chance
[00:31:53] <coldhead> huh
[00:31:54] <gf3> NO U CHANCE
[00:31:56] <virtualint> event does not run when i use trigger
[00:32:03] <coldhead> i'm shocled
[00:32:06] <gf3> also
[00:32:07] <coldhead> shocked*
[00:32:09] <coldhead> and appalled*
[00:32:14] <virtualint> gf3 it is live delegated
[00:32:15] <gf3> whatever you're doing, it's wrong
[00:32:26] <eags_> hello
[00:32:39] <virtualint> gf3 so your suggestions?
[00:32:53] <gf3> virtualint: avoid triggering faux-events
[00:33:09] <eags_> I want to copy pieces of one form into another form.  This works ok if I reparent using .after() but if I do .clone() then the updated values are lost
[00:33:11] <coldhead> i love it when you speak french, gf3
[00:33:31] <gf3> coldhead: apropos
[00:33:35] <gf3> coldhead: deja vu
[00:33:46] * coldhead faps
[00:33:48] <gf3> (do meeeee)
[00:34:09] <eags_> anyone have any suggestions on this?  Even if I look in firebug, it looks like the dom is not updated with the edited values.  so I'm not sure exactly how this works.  However .val() does give the right value
[00:34:11] <coldhead> virtualint: it really should be triggered by trigger(), otherwise what's the point
[00:34:22] <gf3> eags_: look into serialize/populate
[00:34:44] <gf3> eags_: you'll need to either roll your own or use a plugin
[00:36:22] <eags_> gf3: where are the values that clone() is not capturing them?
[00:36:29] <waseem_> gnarf: Okay let me have a look. Thanks!
[00:36:50] <gf3> eags_: the values are not stored in the DOM
[00:37:06] <gf3> eags_: state is not the same as structure
[00:39:36] <waseem_> gnarf: $lis = $lis.add(li) did not work. $lis is initially simply a JS []. I want to put some jQuery elements in it. and doing $lis.push(element) did not work in a way that element itselef is an array.
[00:39:55] <waseem_> gnarf: Because of $list being an JS [] I used .push.
[00:41:09] <gnarf> ?js var a = [].contact( [ 1,2,3] ); a
[00:41:10] <bot-t> gnarf: TypeError: [].contact is not a function
[00:41:17] <gnarf> ?js var a = [].concat( [ 1,2,3] ); a
[00:41:18] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2, 3]
[00:41:30] <gnarf> so like $lis.concat( li.get() )
[00:41:45] <gnarf> anyway
[00:41:47] <gnarf> ?glwt
[00:41:47] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[00:41:50] <gnarf> im headin to bed
[00:41:56] <waseem_> gnarf: Good night :)
[00:42:18] <VorTechS> hey all :)
[00:42:43] <VorTechS> can anyone offer any clues as to why this works in Firefox/Chrome/IE9 but not IE7/8: http://jsfiddle.net/PgM5z/2/
[00:42:49] <coldhead> virtualint: http://jsfiddle.net/WJNkB/1/
[00:43:03] <VorTechS> note: two vertical accordions, top one never appears in IE7/8
[00:43:16] <innociv> How would I use .css() to change a property differently for chrome and ff?  Need background-image: -moz-linear-gradient:...; background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient:...;
[00:43:36] <innociv> As they both us the same property, it's weird.
[00:47:44] <coldhead> innociv: can't you just assign both properties in CSS and give the thing the appropriate class?
[00:48:37] <innociv> You mean css({backgroundImage:'-moz..',backgroundImage:'-webkit'})?  I feel like the 2nd one is going to replace the first.
[00:50:00] <xec> what about a class, in your css file
[00:52:04] <coldhead> that's what i meant, in your CSS
[00:53:44] <juha_> Our school rocks. They're teaching dreamweaver because "It's easy to teach", no matter that nobody uses it ever in real life, and if someone does, they should burn in the mountain doom
[00:54:11] <xp_prg> how do I clear a div of its contents?
[00:54:36] <juha_> ?empty @ xp_prg
[00:54:36] <bot-t> xp_prg, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[00:56:13] <xp_prg> I have <ul><li> menu bar, I bind events to clicking on them and update a single div with content, is that normal/good practice, I am new to this
[01:00:11] <innociv> coldhead, oh no because I want to do a gradient animation
[01:01:24] <xp_prg> so nobody wants to answer my question?
[01:01:46] <innociv> jsfiddle
[01:02:03] <xp_prg> am I doing it right?
[01:02:04] <innociv> It sounds fine as long as it remains simple
[01:02:18] <xp_prg> how do most other people do it?
[01:10:58] <innociv> xp_prg, you really need to post an example page
[01:11:04] <innociv> a simple one
[01:17:26] <innociv> and yeah, confirming that css({backgroundImage:'-moz..',backgroundImage:'-webkit'}) doesnt' work
[01:17:30] <innociv> I guess I can doa  browser check
[01:23:20] <bryricker> How do the jquery tabs work? The documentation doesn't explain it. It looks for an unordered list then turns each list item into a tab? Then uses its href value to display a div with the same ID?
[01:32:08] <xp_prg> byricker you talking about jquery ui?
[01:34:26] <bryricker> xp_prg: yeah
[01:34:34] <bryricker> what am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/2urRX/
[01:39:31] <xp_prg> I am new to jquery ui, I would not know forgive me
[01:42:44] <ablomen> bryricker, http://jsfiddle.net/2urRX/2/ << you did not include a theme, that's all
[01:44:02] <bryricker> ablomen: of course… I'm so stupid, I've been using jquery-ui features on another section of the website but forgot to include the stylesheet on this section. Thanks!
[01:55:31] <xec> innociv: just curious, maybe you could animate gradients with background-position, seeing as they are specified as images?
[01:56:41] <xec> innociv: you can find hooks for background position here: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js
[02:00:18] <seutje> u mean like http://codepo8.github.com/CSS3-Rainbow-Dividers/ ? \o/
[02:03:00] <xec> yaaay party
[02:05:46] <xec> haha, i love that they named the animations "charlieeee"
[02:13:12] <Spadeski> coldhead I just screwed my layout up mind checkin to see if everythings good http://209.172.30.1/WWWRoot/?gp=profile everything is piling on top in the middle content
[02:33:32] <Slartibart> Any jquery ui tabs experts? I've got two different tab sets reachable from the "root" tabs(i.e. basically three tab sets on page). One is loaded automatically when the page loads. But if I then click into the other set and then back into the first - which worked the first time - that subpage from the first subset is reloaded but the tab buttons aren't recreated :-[
[02:44:33] <diverdude> I am trying to find the first child hidden element. Is this a correct way to do that: console.log($(':hidden:first', $($(this).prev())).val()); ?
[02:45:04] <red> What event do I use to monitor an input field for changes?
[02:45:06] <xp_prg> I am trying to understand how to create a json string to send in an ajax call
[02:45:18] <red> Those changes might not be from user input, so click and keyup alone won't do
[02:45:34] <red> It might also be some code using .val() to change it
[02:46:30] <rgr> I can do something like setTimeout(function(){$("#id").html="";},1000); but its cleaner to so $("selector").setTimeout() right?
[02:46:40] <rgr> or whats the equiv?
[02:47:11] <rgr> xp_prg: you encode it...
[02:47:34] <NodeX> rgr : you cannot do jquery().setTimout();
[02:47:44] <NodeX> there is a defer plugin iirc
[02:49:23] <rgr> NodeX: so I might as well stick with what I already do. Just wanted to see if there was a jq equiv
[02:49:41] <rgr> xp_prg: here is an extract to get you going : http://pastebin.com/5kNAqL0b
[02:49:56] <NodeX> in defer() .. it might be in the branch but it was a plugin
[02:50:15] <NodeX> else it's very easy to write your own
[02:50:42] <rgr> actually there is "delay()"
[02:51:07] <NodeX> i thought it got merged !
[02:51:09] <rgr> and dont say "write your own" ;) If I wanted to write my own I wouldnd ask about a jquery equiv ;))
[02:51:20] <rgr> I'm a basic user ..
[02:51:26] <NodeX> and I know this how ?
[02:51:32] <rgr> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[02:51:36] <NodeX> at no point did you say you were
[02:51:49] <rgr> nevertheless, "write your own" is never an answer. Especially when the library does have what I want.
[02:52:04] <NodeX> It's always an answer
[02:52:07] <blackspotwiggins> rgr, you want jquery to have a setTimeout wrapper?
[02:52:10] <blackspotwiggins> it does not
[02:52:14] <NodeX> as you can see I answered with it
[02:52:29] <rgr> yes it does.
[02:52:35] <rgr> but thanks anyway.
[02:52:36] <NodeX> ".delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases."
[02:52:37] <blackspotwiggins> rgr, wanna bet?
[02:52:47] <NodeX> read the thing in BOLD on the page :)
[02:52:47] <rgr> its exactly what I want in this use case.
[02:52:56] <rgr> or, do I have to eat humble pie ;)
[02:53:03] <blackspotwiggins> that does not mean it replaces settimeout
[02:53:17] <rgr> it is what I want since I dont want to cancel.
[02:53:20] <NodeX> .delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function
[02:53:20] <rgr> anyways.
[02:53:27] <rgr> in certain instances.
[02:53:45] <rgr> Since i dont need to cancel it IS what i want in this use case.
[02:54:03] <NodeX> that still doesn't make it a replacement which is what you were saying it was
[02:54:04] <rgr> just to ensure a certain elements html is set to empty after a certain period.
[02:54:04] <harshada> hey i have a div( suppose id='main_div') which contains 2 divs (suppose ids are 'first_div', 'second_div' resp).. now onclick event i want to swap divs.. so when i do $('#main_div').find(--) i ll get swap div sequence..
[02:54:07] <harshada> any idea?
[02:54:08] <NodeX> anyway good luck
[02:54:41] <NodeX> harshada : you don't need find()
[02:54:52] <NodeX> they are reff'd by ID so the lookup is fast
[02:56:43] <ktada> how to use drag and drop in mobile application using jquery
[02:56:54] <harshada> NodeX: actually in other function m using find .. to get elements.. and its not coming as swap sequence..
[02:57:02] <NodeX> you would do it like this anyway (or summit like this) ... $().click(function(event) { $("#first_div").appendTo("#main_div"); }
[02:57:52] <NodeX> harshada : I don't understand what you just said so I can't help sorry
[03:04:08] <xp_prg> I am confused by this, I have var post_args = new Array(); then post_args['delete_posts'] =1; alert(JSON.stringify(post_args)); shows []
[03:04:19] <xp_prg> what am I missing?
[03:04:48] <torholm> xp_prg: var post_args = { delete_posts: 1 };
[03:05:28] <xp_prg> how do I make a blank one though, just curious?
[03:05:35] <xp_prg> is it just post_args = {}; ?
[03:05:39] <pratz> hey guys i have a form  and i use serialize() to post form data and then make a ajax call. How can i make the validation on this form, i want to check if any textbox is empty , any help is appreicated , thanks
[03:05:44] <torholm> xp_prg: arrays in javascript don't work the same way as in php
[03:05:48] <torholm> xp_prg: yes, {} is empty
[03:05:52] <xp_prg> ok thanks :>
[03:06:41] <pratz> during serialize() can i validate the form fields ??
[03:07:16] <NodeX> pratz : in your submit handler var th= $(this).find('textarea'); th.each(function(index) {if($(this).val()==''} return
[03:09:36] <red> I have a code that should be executed once user inputs stuff in a <input> area, it works with keyup and click, but not when I add the value to the field with .val(), nothing happends
[03:09:49] <red> I've tried .trigger('change') and adding a change handler but didnt work either
[03:10:15] <red> The problem is that I can't call my function from the scope of where the .val() is being pushed to the input field, so I cannot trigger it directly
[03:10:28] <NodeX> change() is a series of events
[03:10:34] <NodeX> try trigger blur
[03:10:56] <NodeX> I'm not sure you can trigger "change" with jquery (i could be wrong)
[03:11:03] <sean`> you can
[03:11:09] <sean`> you can trigger any event you want
[03:11:13] <red> nothing happends mm
[03:11:24] <NodeX> learn something new every day :)
[03:11:31] <sean`> but it won't always work as you might think it will
[03:11:37] <sean`> like .click() doesn't make you go to a link
[03:11:43] <sean`> You need real user interaction for that
[03:11:57] <sean`> same for change
[03:12:24] <NodeX> [11:10:26] <NodeX> change() is a series of events
[03:12:36] <red> I can console.log(jQuery(parent.url_field)); to find the element (I've set it with  window.url_field   = jQuery(media_popup).parents().find('input').eq(1); )
[03:12:52] <red> I can alter the .val() and take it up as well :|
[03:13:15] <red> Just need a way to trigger something there to run a function out of the iframe scope where the user input is coming from :|
[03:14:22] <pratz_> NodeX: form where should i import the find() method / func ??
[03:14:35] <NodeX> insude your submit handler
[03:14:38] <NodeX> inside *
[03:15:01] <NodeX> $('#your-form').submit(function(event) {event.preventDefault() .... IN HERE!! });
[03:29:08] <Slartibart> When should .tabs() be called for jquery ui tabs? Once when document is ready, or each time a tab is loaded? Reason I'm asking is that some(all but one) tabs contain tab widgets as well, so clicking back and forth among "root" tabs can cause tabs to be loaded again/recreated.
[03:33:13] <rgr> Hmm. Am I being naive to expect the html() call to only happen after the fadeOut completes? '$("sel").fadeOut(5000).html("");'
[03:33:54] <rgr> I'm guessing yes since the html replacement happens imediately.
[03:34:17] <rgr> so I suppose I need to make the html a callback in the fadeOut call?
[03:34:27] <petisnnake> If I make an ajax call, and refresh or close the page that made the call, does the script called through ajax get ran?
[03:34:59] <NodeX> petisnnake  ?
[03:35:28] <NodeX> if the request was made it's down to your server processing the URL
[03:35:33] <NodeX> it's fire and forget
[03:35:51] <petisnnake> what do you mean by fire and forget?
[03:35:55] <NodeX> well that's half true
[03:36:18] <NodeX> it means that once you start a request for somehting your server processes it until it errors or responds
[03:36:40] <rgr> but the ajax object waiting for the response will be killed I think, or?
[03:36:48] <petisnnake> yes
[03:37:00] <NodeX> of course  .. everything is unloaded on page unload
[03:37:32] <petisnnake> let's say I have a page that makes a call to a script that updates a db and takes about 1 minute to complete. If I terminate the calling script / page, does the updatin script finish?
[03:37:52] <NodeX> it's not down to ajax after it's been fired
[03:37:58] <NodeX> it's down to your server
[03:38:22] <NodeX> each server is configured differently .. if your's is configured to continue then yes else no
[03:39:09] <petisnnake> thans a lot
[03:39:43] <NodeX> :)
[03:39:43] <mazzachre> scripts that are so little responsive, is a bad thing anyway... Frontend stuff needs to be responsive. In case that is not possible make it update a progress bar and make that update tell the server side to continue or stop...
[03:42:55] <rgr> So I expect this to fade out the select element, replace the inner text and then fade it back in. Would you? Is there someting blindingly obvious missing? $("#fbconnecttext").fadeOut(3000).html("new text").fadeIn(3000);
[03:43:27] <NodeX> use the callback
[03:43:50] <NodeX> fadeOut(3000,function(){$(this).html("new text")}...
[03:43:56] <rgr> so whats fundamentally wrong with the above? Does fadeOut return immediately and asynchrously?
[03:44:01] <xec> yes
[03:44:04] <rgr> bah!
[03:44:06] <rgr> thanks
[03:44:09] <NodeX> if you absolutley need to synchronously chaing it
[03:44:11] <NodeX> chain *
[03:46:25] <inad922> hello
[03:46:28] <xec> hello
[03:46:42] <inad922> There can be only one onload function or can I define more them one of them?
[03:46:54] <NodeX> one
[03:47:07] <inad922> I see.
[03:47:09] <NodeX> well for window.onload anyway
[03:47:21] <james_May> hi all, i am at a complete loss
[03:47:35] <xec> you can have many $(document).load(...) afaik
[03:47:38] <james_May> Could anyone tell me why the success handler doesnt trigger on this? http://jsfiddle.net/6Rnf6/
[03:47:46] <james_May> but the error handler does
[03:48:06] <inad922> I'm serving a webpage with django and I cutted up the page into templates and it would make sense to define onload functions for each element. But if it can't be done it can't be done.
[03:48:44] <NodeX> james_May : console.log(result); and see why
[03:49:01] <NodeX> inad922 : you can do what you want qith load()
[03:49:12] <NodeX> look it up on the jquery load() api docs
[03:49:59] <james_May> NodeX:  you refering to js fiddles error?
[03:50:14] <xec> inad922: http://jsfiddle.net/JEjsq/
[03:50:29] <james_May> NodeX: you talking about the Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL....
[03:50:56] <NodeX> james_May : console.log(result) and see why it wont output it
[03:51:05] <james_May> i just have
[03:51:06] <james_May> i get Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL
[03:51:12] <NodeX> then there is your answer!
[03:51:15] <james_May> not really
[03:51:21] <james_May> it only does that on js fiddle
[03:51:22] <NodeX> well yes it is really lol
[03:51:25] <james_May> it doesnt do that on my server
[03:51:32] <NodeX> what does it do on your server
[03:51:54] <NodeX> I thought it was obvious to test it on yor server sorry for not adding that
[03:52:07] <inad922> Cool. This is what I looked for. Thanks NodeX and xec.
[03:52:13] <NodeX> :D
[03:52:29] <james_May> NodeX:  no worries let me get you a link to where im really testing it
[03:52:33] <NodeX> load != onload !!
[03:52:39] <james_May> NodeX:  here: http://goo.gl/xMiTm
[03:52:50] <NodeX> I dont need one - just pastebin what it says
[03:53:27] <Putr> hey. Is there "the" jquery autocomplete plugin?
[03:53:36] <james_May> NodeX: ignore that link its the wrong one
[03:53:42] <Putr> or any recomendations on what to use?
[03:53:46] <NodeX> lol
[03:54:08] <james_May> NodeX:  this one http://goo.gl/VMTKX
[03:54:44] <NodeX> The requested URL /select_demo.php was not found on this server.
[03:55:07] <james_May> :S
[03:55:10] <james_May> it doesnt say that to me
[03:55:21] <james_May> i get status: 200 OK
[03:55:31] <NodeX> you probably have a cached version of the first page loading
[03:55:44] <BobHolt> james_May, you're looking at the change event on the dropdown, not the submit event, right?
[03:55:51] <james_May> yes BobHolt
[03:55:55] <NodeX> data: {id: $(this).val(), ajax: 'true'}, <---- remove that comma
[03:56:08] <james_May> done NodeX
[03:56:11] <dross> so...
[03:56:19] <dross> what's the most useful up to date book for jquery?
[03:56:29] <dross> I need something I can bring myself up to speed when I switch projects and come back
[03:56:41] <james_May> NodeX:  select_demo.php finds on my console
[03:56:55] <james_May> and i still get the error handler triggering and not the .success
[03:57:16] <NodeX> can you put "console.log(result)" before the results.success line
[03:57:19] <Proteus^> dross its not a book but the most up to date information and tutorials are at http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[03:57:35] <james_May> NodeX:  plus im talking about the change event not when you press book
[03:57:45] <dross> Proteus^: I need something full of examples and such I can load on a kindle
[03:57:52] <dross> I'm always going and travelling
[03:57:56] <NodeX> I realise that now ... please put the console.log line in
[03:58:11] <james_May> console.log(result); ?
[03:58:26] <NodeX> yes
[03:58:37] <james_May> i get an object
[03:58:42] <james_May> with the stuff i need right
[03:58:53] <NodeX> omg .. put the line in and tell me when it's in lol
[03:58:59] <NodeX> and I will tell you what's wrgon
[03:59:00] <NodeX> wrong *
[03:59:04] <james_May> i have!
[03:59:10] <Proteus^> dross http://docs.jquery.com/Alternative_Resources#PDF_versions_of_the_documentation
[03:59:17] <NodeX> I can't see it
[03:59:34] <james_May> oh sorry i thought you meant put it in my console not in the script
[03:59:38] <james_May> NodeX:  where do you want it
[03:59:57] <Proteus^> assume the kindle can handle a pdf, i dont actually own one :)
[04:00:25] <NodeX> [11:57:14] <NodeX> can you put "console.log(result)" before the results.success line
[04:00:32] <NodeX> result.success **
[04:00:59] <james_May> 1sec
[04:01:22] <james_May> done
[04:02:03] <james_May> it just throws in the object like expected..
[04:03:01] <james_May> NodeX ^
[04:04:56] <NodeX> maybe a JSON encoding issue on the backend
[04:05:13] <NodeX> script is expecting formed json and being sent malformed mebbe ?
[04:05:27] <james_May> NodeX:  i can show you the php script sending back if you like
[04:05:34] <NodeX> yer
[04:05:41] <NodeX> pastebin it
[04:06:40] <james_May> NodeX:  http://pastebin.com/euz5GKdT
[04:06:59] <james_May> its confusing because the object says OK and 200, yet the error handler triggers
[04:07:09] <james_May> makes it hard to debug
[04:07:24] <NodeX> echo(json_encode($json)); not echo($json);
[04:07:41] <NodeX> line 43 change to: echo(json_encode($json));
[04:08:18] <dross> Proteus^: hmmmmm
[04:08:24] <NodeX> i'm assumingyour php installation has the json functions (i.e php5.1+)
[04:08:38] <james_May> NodeX:  yes and changing that
[04:08:38] <dross> the cheat sheet is broken :-( Some guy who looks like the Master from Dr Who appears on the webpage
[04:08:58] <Proteus^> lol
[04:08:58] <james_May> works, thank you NodeX :)
[04:09:36] <NodeX> :)
[04:11:19] <Proteus^> dross thats pretty funny.
[04:11:40] <Proteus^> someone should report that to the jquery team
[04:11:46] <Proteus^> or whoever runs the website
[04:12:01] <dross> Ticket subject: The drums are getting louder!
[04:12:31] <harshada> hey what is alternate method of drag and drop.. i want same functionality on click event??
[04:13:55] <Proteus^> you can almost see his nose hairs.
[04:14:16] <NodeX> harshada : that makes no sense lol
[04:14:31] <dross> Proteus^: the shot makes him stuck up too, just like The Master
[04:14:39] <dross> *makes him look
[04:15:11] * dross loves photography, though I don't think many people understand how their photos affect their appearance
[04:17:34] <diverdude> is there a good searchable dropdown list plugin i could use out there?
[04:17:38] <Proteus^> harshada we dont understand what you mean :)  can you try to be more descriptive?
[04:17:58] <Proteus^> driverdude do you mean like an autocomplete?
[04:20:09] <diverdude> Proteus^, yeah. I have fetched an array with key=>value pairs to put in a <select>. I was hoping there was some jquery plugin which appends a textfield to the <select> box, so that i can start typing in the textfield 'a' and only all values staring with a remains in the list...'af' only af... remains etc.
[04:20:37] <diverdude> so basically a filter
[04:22:40] <diverdude> actually this one is nice: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[04:23:58] <diverdude> By referencing: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js i fetch my jquery from google. Can i somehow do the same with jquery UI?
[04:24:27] <angelkoilov> diverdude: try use google loader
[04:24:42] <diverdude> angelkoilov, do you have a link?
[04:24:52] <angelkoilov> http://code.google.com/apis/loader/
[04:25:07] <angelkoilov>  google.load("jquery", "1.4.2");
[04:25:07] <angelkoilov>   google.load("jqueryui", "1.7.2");
[04:25:08] <diverdude> ah
[04:25:09] <angelkoilov> ... etc
[04:25:47] <diverdude> ahh you need a KEY. Is it expensive?
[04:26:19] <angelkoilov> ..... read the whole page ....
[04:26:38] <Proteus`> stupid airport internet :-P
[04:26:39] <james_May> NodeX: its returning my json as a string :S
[04:27:06] <Proteus`> diverdude it looks like you can use the autocomplete as a combobox which would do exactly what you wanted :) i didnt know about the combo box option myself :)
[04:27:21] <Proteus`> gotta go :)
[04:27:40] <NodeX> james_May : you need to do somehting on the script then
[04:28:00] <diverdude> angelkoilov, ahh you need a URL to use google loader...i dont have one yet...
[04:28:10] <james_May> grr

[04:28:56] <NodeX> also http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[04:43:43] <thomedy> okay i have been working on the logic of a site im building and i am  having a hard time
[04:43:53] <thomedy> if i js fiddle it would someone help me please
[04:45:48] <rgr> in a jquery chain, whats the neatest construct for selecting the first img or tag found which is a child of next() ? e.g $("sel").something().next(). *here* ?
[04:47:43] <rgr> possibly .next().find("img").first() ?
[04:48:54] <james_May> NodeX:  this is weird
[04:49:00] <james_May> json_encode is making it a string
[04:49:11] <seutje> that's crazy
[04:53:51] <aBoiler> hi, do you think that to store a lot of dom nodes in one array in order to view if the array already contains one specific node will be slow?
[04:53:56] <aBoiler> in practice var io = allnodes.indexOf(document.body); if(io>-1) return myinstances[io];
[05:05:15] <chris_five> hi there, i have a question :) I'm appending a div to the body, but i can't access it afterwords with .hide() or other functions - seems to me like it isnt in the DOM where jquery is looking for it .. http://pastebin.com/TV4PHT9z
[05:06:09] <seutje> ?regex
[05:06:53] <logik-bomb> chris_five: ";"
[05:08:28] <De|work> chris_five, its working, where's problem? http://jsfiddle.net/aj9EY/
[05:10:13] <DjMadness> Hi, i am using "var register_username = document.register.register_username.value;" on a document ready, however i am unable to get the value that the browser appends to it apon load, is there something i can do, so it waits until the browser has inserted the data ?
[05:13:48] <De|work> DjMadness, more code, more examples... try reproducing your situation @ jsfiddle.net
[05:14:57] <juha_> DjMadness: after appending content to that element, load it again like this: var myContent = $("input[name=register_username]").val() for example
[05:15:15] <DjMadness> i guess a pastebin would be enough for this, http://pastebin.com/KndD3Kxn (with some comments ofc)
[05:15:47] <DjMadness> juha_: it works when i use blur, but however i am trying to get the data that ie chrome spits into the field
[05:16:17] <DjMadness> ie remembered passwords etc
[05:17:19] <DjMadness> there is something in the field when the page loads, however i beleive the data comes after $(document).ready
[05:17:37] <rgr> what chrome spits in etc isnt done when its created.
[05:17:39] <DjMadness> hence the data being null
[05:17:54] <DjMadness> there any workarounds for that ?
[05:18:16] <rgr> trying to scrape passwords or what? ;) lol. No, I know you're not ...
[05:18:44] <DjMadness> no i am not, its the data user puts in. so it checks if username is in use apon document.ready
[05:19:49] <aro> i have a jqueryui progress bar that i am trying to animate its progress, i am using: $( "#progressbar" ).find( ".ui-progressbar-value" ).animate({ "width": value + "%" }, { duration: 300, queue: true }); but it seems to be sticking at around 2-5%
[05:19:57] <aro> anyone know what i am doing wrong?
[05:20:06] <DjMadness> basicly it will call a $post with the username and send the reply 0 or 1 based apon success/fail
[05:22:54] <juha_> DjMadness: wrap your code inside $(document).ready(function());
[05:23:37] <xp_prg> hi all, I have a form with id post_frm and a checkbox with id delete_posts, how do I get the value of the checkbox?
[05:23:38] <diverdude> When i do  google.load("jqueryui", "1.8.16"); and then copy/paste the code from http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ it looks like no styling is applied. Do i have to include some css also?
[05:23:50] <juha_> indeed yes.
[05:23:58] <xp_prg> I try this:  $("delete_posts:checked").val() but that doesn't work
[05:24:05] <DjMadness> juha_: its already wrapped inside that
[05:24:28] <DjMadness> i am starting to think its some security meassure prevending me from it..
[05:24:33] <DjMadness> preventing*
[05:24:41] <Asone> what is that "queue: true" in time spec for animation aro ?
[05:24:57] <Asone> i've never seen that in the jquery doc for animation, it is possible to queue the anims ?
[05:25:12] <juha_> DjMadness: have you googled if other people have similar issues?

[05:38:13] <juha_> diverdude: provide demo
[05:39:23] <diverdude> hmmm ok...i was missing this: http://static.jquery.com/ui/css/demo-docs-theme/ui.theme.css
[05:39:51] <diverdude> Is it possible to obtain that one from google also?
[05:41:10] <aro> is there a way to animate a width percentage?

[05:43:30] <juha_> i dunno, google it

[05:49:09] <sadmicrowave> anybody know how to incorporate a javascript variable with an inline php tag? i.e. <?php echo $myArray[ this.point.x ]; ?> where this.point is a javascript object and x is the value holder
[05:49:57] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, cant do that
[05:50:01] <sadmicrowave> :(
[05:50:02] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, not like that
[05:50:11] <sadmicrowave> :) advice?
[05:50:11] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, php is serverside, js is clientside
[05:50:14] <logik-bomb> they run at different times
[05:50:26] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, use document ready function
[05:50:41] <sadmicrowave> I am, this script is inside document.ready
[05:51:07] <aro> what would cause animate to not animate my percentage width properly?
[05:51:28] <sadmicrowave> aro, show your code
[05:51:31] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, if you want a value from server you make postback
[05:51:39] <aro> $( "#progressbar" ).find( ".ui-progressbar-value" ).animate({ width: value + "%" }, { duration: 1000, queue: true });
[05:52:54] <sadmicrowave> diverdude, I guess I could have php make a js array on page creation then in my document.ready call the js array instead of the php array
[05:53:15] <diverdude> if you want
[05:53:26] <sadmicrowave> what do you mean by postback?
[05:53:26] <diverdude> you can also just make callback and fetch the one value you need
[05:54:21] <sadmicrowave> diverdude, can you give an example? I'm not familiar with making callbacks like that
[05:54:49] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, look at  $.post, $.get or $.ajax
[05:54:54] <sadmicrowave> oh
[05:55:12] <sadmicrowave> nevermind, yea I know about those, thats not what I want, thanks anyways
[05:55:14] <dleonardi> hello
[05:55:18] <sadmicrowave> hi'
[05:56:01] <dleonardi> i've got what i expect to be an instance, as it gets returned by $("#domnodeID").jqueryPlugin({params})
[05:56:09] <diverdude> sadmicrowave, im pretty sure thats what you want...
[05:56:21] <dleonardi> i would like to set up an event listener for method calls within that instance
[05:56:58] <dleonardi> doing var foo = mylineabove; foo.bind("methodName", function(){console.debug(arguments)}); doesnt work as i'd expect
[05:57:45] <dleonardi> why not?
[06:00:29] <NodeX> because it cant find the element
[06:00:49] <NodeX> log the "mylineabove"
[06:10:03] <Mech0z> I have 10 accordions which all have the class accordion_tab, I am trying to select what is inside 1 of them and then replace that with some html I get through ajax

[06:10:18] <bot-t1> ((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]])
[06:10:22] <aro> weird
[06:10:29] <aro> it works fine on jsfiddle
[06:10:47] <Mech0z> I have this code to select it var closest = $(this).closest('.accordion_tab'); which works but if I do var closest = $(this).closest('.accordion_tab').siblings(); it selects all but the one I want

[06:15:08] <lucenut> Anyone know how to turn that function on?
[06:15:16] <lucenut> Hey guys, noob question. I'm using this datepicker: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-maxDate
[06:15:27] <lucenut> There's a maxDate option. I want to restrict the date picker to between a startdate and enddate.
[06:15:31] <d0ax> Im looking for some example of tool, for door measure
[06:15:36] <lucenut> But I don't understand how to do that option.
[06:15:37] <d0ax> choosing etc with grid and possibility of changing doors
[06:15:43] <d0ax> I would like to use it at the shop for the clients
[06:15:47] <d0ax> Give them possibility to choose products
[06:16:20] <pachet> i'm going door to door to make you this exclusive offer
[06:16:28] <pachet> ;[
[06:16:31] <rroelofs> lucenut: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#min-max
[06:16:52] <rroelofs> lucenut: there are many ways to specify the date range
[06:17:46] <lucenut> Thanks. :-)
[06:18:01] <Mech0z> If I have a <div class="test"> </div> how do I select and remove just what is inside that div and not the div itself
[06:18:57] <dleonardi> binding on method calls, anyone? http://pastebin.com/2C9kGCM1 << why doesnt this work???
[06:18:58] <rroelofs> Mech0z: $(".test").html("") will remove it
[06:20:39] <Mech0z> rroelofs: if I have more than one div with that class name, can I use closest to somehow limit my removal ? like var closest = $(this).closest('.test').html('') ?
[06:21:16] <davetarmac> Interesting puzzle time! I have three columns, each as a <div>, in these I have three sections of content, again, held in <div>. I need the content holders to be the same height as the tallest one.
[06:21:49] <davetarmac> I currently have this: http://www.pastie.org/2631972
[06:21:52] <davetarmac> but it's not working
[06:21:53] <Wa1deMar> j_J
[06:22:02] <rroelofs> Mech0z: $.closest works up the tree, so your code snippet will find either itself or the closest parent that matches.  so it will remove itself.  Is that what you want?
[06:22:25] <Wa1deMar> hello all. help me please
[06:22:30] <Mech0z> I want to remove children to the closest
[06:22:54] <rroelofs> dleonardi: you can create custom events but you still have to trigger them
[06:22:56] <Mech0z> I want to replace the insdie of the Div with some html I get through Ajax
[06:23:22] <dleonardi> rroelofs: are you saying i cannot just bind to a method call on some instance?
[06:23:31] <dleonardi> i dont care about custom events.
[06:23:38] <dleonardi> i dont want to have to use .trigger() for this
[06:23:42] <sadmicrowave> anybody use the HighCharts plugin?
[06:23:50] <diverdude> is there any way to use autocomplete plugin with key/value pairs ?
[06:24:21] <rroelofs> dleonardi: what is supposed to trigger that function call?
[06:24:50] <dleonardi> that method ("gotoPage") gets invoked by UI interaction
[06:25:21] <diverdude> ?
[06:25:59] <Wa1deMar> how can I parse this type of xml - <media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/F4uFuiNj3rM/default.jpg"/> ???
[06:26:41] <NodeX> parsing is outside the scope of this chan lol
[06:26:48] <NodeX> especialy XML parsing
[06:27:08] <rroelofs> dleonardi: Sorry, I apparently am not understanding your question.   You can bind to a method, but you can't pass it arguments
[06:27:47] <dleonardi> i want to set up an event handler which listens on the invocation of a method of a specific instance of something
[06:27:53] <rroelofs> dleonardi you can do $thing.bind("gotoPage", methName);
[06:28:03] <dleonardi> well the fuck that isnt working!

[06:29:12] <pachet> not super complex :[
[06:30:00] <davetarmac> pachet: thanks for that
[06:30:03] <dleonardi> rroelofs: look at that pastebin link please
[06:30:09] <davetarmac> and that will work for divs in divs?
[06:30:19] <davetarmac> as long as they have the same class
[06:30:19] <dleonardi> thats [in my eyes] exactly what you posted in the chan. innit?
[06:30:37] <pachet> i mean, i havent seen your markup
[06:30:42] <pachet> there may be other styles that cause conflicts
[06:31:24] <davetarmac> I'll give it a shot, pachet - thanks
[06:32:49] <dannN> hi. is it possible to make a keep-alive connection with jquery, like facebook does for the chat?
[06:32:55] <rroelofs> dleonardi: I did.  I also just looked at the anythingSlider page and I don't see a gotoPage event.  is gotoPage the name of your function?
[06:33:07] <dleonardi> it's not an event
[06:33:09] <dleonardi> its a method
[06:34:19] <dleonardi> specifically at line 418 of jquery.anythingslider.js
[06:34:30] <dleonardi> perhaps i am holding it wrong.
[06:34:33] <dleonardi> i see "base.gotoPage"
[06:34:36] <dleonardi> not "gotoPage"
[06:34:40] <dleonardi> pebcak?
[06:35:38] <pachet> dannN: yes, jq uses xhr long polling
[06:35:54] <pachet> ben nadel has a good writeup about the science of it : http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1976-Long-Polling-Experiment-With-jQuery-And-ColdFusion.htm
[06:36:09] <dleonardi> nah, even using base.gotoPage doesnt change anything
[06:36:11] <pachet> *fb uses xhr long polling, rather
[06:36:34] <dannN> pachet: thank you
[06:36:48] <dleonardi> the technology is also called Comet
[06:36:55] <dleonardi> dannN:
[06:36:58] <rroelofs> dleonardi: I've never used anythingSlider, but the .bind) call has the event first and the function name second.  The only way to trigger an action when a function is called is to add a $.trigger inside that function to trigger the custom event
[06:37:26] <dleonardi> thats retarded, expecting that i change plugin sources to bind to events
[06:37:41] <dleonardi> how the crap do i bind to a method call within an instance ?
[06:37:43] <dannN> is this something similar?
[06:37:44] <dannN> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/refresh
[06:37:47] <davetarmac> pachet: worked a treat! Thanks for the assit
[06:37:47] <logik-bomb> guys how can I create a fallback for users without flash installed?
[06:37:50] <davetarmac> *assist
[06:37:52] <rroelofs> dleonardi: What are you trying to acomplish with this?
[06:37:54] <dleonardi> it cant be possible that jquery makes something this trivial this difficult
[06:38:00] <pachet> davetarmac: yw!
[06:38:04] <dleonardi> rroelofs: tie together two damn sliders
[06:38:12] <seutje> binding to a method call? o.O
[06:38:21] <dleonardi> for which, i have to bind to method calls, since the damn slider doesnt provide events
[06:39:09] <seutje> like window.alert.addEventListener('call', function() {}) ? o.O
[06:39:40] <seutje> wait, are u blaming jQuery core coz some plugin is shitty?
[06:39:48] <dleonardi> no
[06:40:02] <dleonardi> i am blaming jquery its so difficult or unevident to connect to method calls
[06:40:08] <dleonardi> has nothing to do with the plugin
[06:40:25] <dleonardi> so again: how do i bind to a method call on an instance?
[06:40:46] <VeXii> events maybe?
[06:41:20] <dleonardi> *ahem* fuck events. no i am NOT modifying other peoples code to add in custom events.
[06:41:35] <dleonardi> i want to know when something gets called. it cant be so difficult or?
[06:42:14] <aro> i am trying to animate using this: $( "#progressbar .ui-progressbar-value" ).animate({ width: newWidth }, "slow"); where newWidth = (value)%
[06:42:17] <rroelofs> dleonardi Ah, I see.  This component's design will make this 'interesting'
[06:42:27] <aro> but it just jumps to the new value, instead of animating to it. what can cause that?
[06:42:29] <dleonardi> rroelofs: thats for sure
[06:45:31] <pachet> dannN: that plugin is more for short polling
[06:45:40] <rroelofs> dleonardi: hacking the plugin source is probably the easiest solution.  Switching widgets might be a better long-term solution.  jquery.cycle is a similar thing
[06:45:42] <pachet> note that there's no method defined for trimming changes from the xhr text
[06:45:59] <dannN> pachet: ok, is there an jquery/php plugin or tutorial to learn?
[06:46:21] <dleonardi> ok..
[06:46:32] <aro> why would animate jump straight to a value instead of animating it?
[06:47:18] <landypro> exit
[06:47:22] <dleonardi> well, "switching plugins" is not the option. matter of fact, i'll go back to writing my own plugin, but not based on a toolkit that doesnt even provide method connects. /me is back to using dojo toolkit.
[06:47:33] <dleonardi> goodbye #jquery, and thanks for all the fish.
[06:48:10] <seutje> dleonardi: so ur blaming jQuery core for limitations of the JavaScript language?
[06:48:50] <seutje> u can't do shit like window.alert.addEventListener('call', function() {})
[06:49:02] <dleonardi> i dont want to start a flame war. just saying i give up on jquery.
[06:49:03] <seutje> at least not afaik
[06:49:17] <pachet> dannN: i dont have any tutorials handy, but here's a plugin that might be helpful: https://github.com/RobertFischer/JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater/
[06:49:19] <dleonardi> seutje: i do that every day using dojo.
[06:49:32] <seutje> so use dojo then
[06:49:33] <dannN> pachet: thank you very much
[06:49:42] <dleonardi> dojo.connect(myInstance, "myMethod", scope, function(){});
[06:49:45] <pachet> yw
[06:49:51] <dleonardi> seutje: i will. :)
[06:50:00] <dleonardi> bye
[06:50:24] <VeXii> well if you want pub/sub use dojo then
[06:50:28] <VeXii> as its made for it
[06:50:48] <VeXii> not that you cant easly do somthing like it in jquery, you just have to set it up
[06:50:49] <seutje> when in doubt: use a hammer
[06:51:16] <VeXii> :)
[06:51:37] <rroelofs> Every lib has its strengths and weaknesses.
[06:51:50] <rroelofs> it's all javascript, so you can always do what you want
[06:52:08] <rroelofs> some libs make you work harder in one spot than another.

[06:53:05] <t4nkd> erp
[06:53:36] <tra> any good plugins for displaying some divs that could autoscroll and has a feature that the content circulates?
[06:53:55] <tra> using this now, but it lacks the circular feature: http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/
[06:54:00] <aro> why would animate jump straight to a value instead of animating it?
[06:54:16] <t4nkd> Hey I'm having trouble making a selector; can someone maybe take a look at this screenshot of the DOM and point me in the right direction? https://img.skitch.com/20111003-1q6qbs4cjpp9u2hnmp26nuxx18.jpg
[06:55:09] <erichynds> t4nkd: $("#listing_mapping_9")
[06:55:17] <tra> t4nkd: $(this).prev().find('select');
[06:55:21] <pachet> aro: usually that's caused by a non-numeric variable as your second arg
[06:55:22] <t4nkd> tra: thanks :)
[06:55:40] <aro> non numeric variable as my second arg?
[06:55:56] <aro> cant that be an object or the duration?
[06:58:40] <aro> $( "#progressbar .ui-progressbar-value" ).animate({ width: newWidth }, "slow");
[07:01:38] <pachet> aro: above that line, try adding in $.fx.off = false; and see what happens
[07:05:41] <lucenut> Is there any core tooltip functionality in jquery or just plugins?
[07:06:13] <lucenut> Maybe there's another name for it? I just want the user to be able to see more when they hover over a record in a report.
[07:07:07] <JAAulde> lucenut: no, there is nothing in jQuery core. There is a tooltip coming in jQuery UI
[07:07:20] <JAAulde> and there are lots of existing plugins
[07:07:53] <lucenut> Yeah. In my situation it takes nearly an act of congress to add a js plugin or library.
[07:08:20] <pachet> not difficult to write a tt plugin
[07:08:22] <JAAulde> lucenut: understood
[07:08:46] <JAAulde> lucenut: do you use UI?
[07:09:45] <lucenut> jquery-ui-1.8.custom.css
[07:09:48] <lucenut> That?
[07:10:11] <lucenut> Oh and jquery-ui-1.8rc3.custom.min.js
[07:10:21] <JAAulde> lucenut: yeah, ok
[07:10:58] <JAAulde> lucenut: not sure what custom build you're using, or why you're on an RC, but I just found UI's in-development tooltip code and pulled it in after UI itself
[07:11:41] <JAAulde> lucenut: it has some minor issues, but it stands up to light/moderate use. it's nice because it uses UI's positining code, etc
[07:12:01] <lucenut> Are you talking about a plugin?
[07:12:15] <JAAulde> well, it's part of UI
[07:12:15] <pachet> :O
[07:12:26] <JAAulde> technically, yes, it's a plugin as is all of UI
[07:12:38] <JAAulde> but if you;re already using UI, it seems you could slip that through
[07:12:53] <lucenut> I am trying not to add any js libraries or plugins. That's ALOT more trouble for me.
[07:12:54] <JAAulde> if even that is too much for your political situation, then pachet is right that you could rite something easily
[07:13:18] <JAAulde> s/rite/write/
[07:13:22] <lucenut> So in this ui that we have is there a tooltip widget?
[07:13:28] <JAAulde> no
[07:13:32] <lucenut> Grr.
[07:13:38] <JAAulde> you can get the code from the UI project and patch it int hough
[07:13:42] <JAAulde> since it's UI
[07:13:42] <lucenut> In an upgraded ui?
[07:14:07] <alvincrespo> lucent: theres a jquery plugin for tooltips here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/tooltip
[07:14:08] <JAAulde> lucenut: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip
[07:14:21] <JAAulde> alvincrespo: he is not allwoed to add plugins--been discussed
[07:14:27] <JAAulde> s/allwoed/allowed
[07:14:30] <alvincrespo> oh i see
[07:14:42] <lucenut> ui 1.9 has it though?
[07:14:52] <JAAulde> I was figuring this bit of UI code could be slipped under the radar
[07:15:25] <JAAulde> lucenut: I think so--it's not released ye though
[07:15:35] <lucenut> Ah
[07:16:04] <JAAulde> which is why I went and found the code and added it in
[07:16:08] <JAAulde> works well with 1.8.x
[07:17:50] <lucenut> I'm asking around to see what is better modifying our existing jquery, or using a plugin.
[07:19:20] <JAAulde> IMO, it's better to pull in the UI 1.9 tooltip code after your UI 1.8 (if your custom build supports it)
[07:19:28] <JAAulde> that way you're forward compatible
[07:19:47] <JAAulde> and it's code from the same people you're already using code frome
[07:34:08] <amit_usual> anyone has an idea how I can reload the whole page using facebook
[07:34:36] <varnie> I am newbie in jquery. my simple question is - how is it possible to get to the 2nd table?
[07:34:48] <amit_usual> sorry reload whole page on facebook for a iframe page app
[07:35:09] <pachet> varnie:  $('table').eq(1)
[07:35:10] <pootietang> hi guys, I'm looking for a simple background slideshow that can be activated on a click event.
[07:35:50] <varnie> thanks, pachet. it works.
[07:36:16] <pachet> amit_usual: refresh the iframe src attrib
[07:36:43] <amit_usual> can you elaborate
[07:37:19] <amit_usual> also I need the request to be a post request just like fb makes normall , pachet
[07:39:13] <ccmonsters> hola amigos
[07:40:52] <pachet> amit_usual: facebook api isn't my thing, but im sure the answer you're looking for is here somewhere:
[07:40:55] <pachet> http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/
[07:43:01] <pachet> as far as posting to the iframe, have a form with a target attribute pointing to the iframe on submit
[07:44:03] <keirlavelle> if im sending emails with a php script can anyone tell me any reasons why the email would send to my hotmail but not to my work email?
[07:45:08] <pachet> keirlavelle: probably getting swallowed by spam filter
[07:46:15] <NodeX> hotmail use SPF
[07:46:25] <NodeX> make sure you have SPF setup :)
[07:46:58] <NodeX> sorry - work email (if it uses SPF) check it, else if it's the same web server as mail server make suy
[07:47:12] <NodeX> sure* that there is not a mail loop
[07:52:00] <PhanLord> can one create with jquery.mobile a listview with data-scroll="true" instead of the overflow ? has anyone a sample ?
[07:54:34] <rgr> good idea is to use stackoverflow for the FB questions : they moved their support stuff there since their own was almost as bad their docs.
[07:57:04] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, maybe this is more of a javascript question but -- is there a method that converts string "to human" or "titleizes" them perchance? Like; something that would string replace "_" with " " and capitalize the first letter of each 'word' ?
[07:58:49] <pachet> its a javascript question
[07:58:59] <pachet> .split("_").join(" ")
[07:59:14] <t4nkd> Ah okay so I'll just write my own function to do it then I guess
[07:59:19] <t4nkd> ty :)
[07:59:41] <pachet> var a="something"; a=a.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+a.slice(1) ==> "Something"
[08:02:04] <acies> does jquery have a property/arg for the size of the respective jquery array inside an each(fn) ?
[08:02:55] <diverdude> Is there a filtered dropdownlist like this one: http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/ only with single select instead of multiselect?
[08:04:43] <ildaniel> hey everyone
[08:05:08] <ildaniel> !question
[08:05:27] <ildaniel> ive got a question
[08:05:28] <ildaniel> http://jsfiddle.net/RWVey/
[08:05:33] <diverdude> ildaniel, can you answer my question?
[08:05:42] <ildaniel> wha'ts your question?
[08:05:47] <ildaniel> i just got in...
[08:05:53] <ildaniel> im here to get an answer too :D
[08:07:16] <aro> why would animate jump straight to a value instead of animating it?
[08:07:35] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[08:07:49] <Haprog> aro: maybe you've disabled effects on jquery
[08:08:07] <Haprog> jQuery.fx.off = true;
[08:08:19] <Haprog> check that
[08:08:23] <ildaniel> you talking to me?
[08:08:49] <diverdude> ildaniel, if you know a filtered dropdownlist plugin
[08:09:03] <ildaniel> nope diverdude
[08:09:08] <diverdude> dammit
[08:09:17] <diverdude> nobody seems to be able to answer this qquestion
[08:09:39] <ildaniel> well my question is, how can i stop the mouseout function to be executed, when my div is clicked?
[08:09:47] <NodeX> diverdude : whats the question
[08:10:07] <diverdude> NodeX, If there is a filtered dropdownlist like this one: http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/ only with single select instead of multiselect?
[08:10:12] <NodeX> ildaniel : unbind the event then rebind it
[08:10:27] <ildaniel> you see, if you click on a circle it animates, but when you mouseout....
[08:10:34] <NodeX> diverdude : build one if you can't find one
[08:10:46] <diverdude> NodeX, well....i could save a lot of time
[08:10:53] <ildaniel> i tried that before, ok letme try again.
[08:10:54] <diverdude> NodeX, if i found one
[08:10:57] <pachet> snover: where did you find that 40000 value for FF stack limit?
[08:11:05] <pachet> i went on an engine performance kick yesterday and wanted to read up
[08:11:27] <snover> this is not really performance related. but, tests.novemberborn.net/javascript/callstack-size.html
[08:12:32] <Innocentus> hi
[08:12:49] <Innocentus> I want to pause the slideshow if an image is still downloading
[08:12:56] <Innocentus> is this possible with jquery / javascript?
[08:13:48] <NodeX> no
[08:14:04] <NodeX> jquery has no direct interaction with the server sending the iamge
[08:14:26] <NodeX> it might be possible to check the height of the image as it will be zero until downloaded on -most- browsers
[08:14:38] <NodeX> but it's not reliable cross browser
[08:14:50] <PERECil_> NodeX: readyState event on image to check if it's downloaded
[08:14:58] <PERECil_> that's reliable
[08:15:09] <NodeX> downloaded != rendered
[08:15:50] <NodeX> but I suppose that would work if you dont care about flickering screens while it's rendered
[08:20:49] <cambrian> Greetings! I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me figure out how to use $.getJSON / $.post to resolve a bug in the following code: https://gist.github.com/dbd3b6466fad0b7d1e71
[08:21:26] <t4nkd> hey jquery, how do I make a variable for a selector; e.g. $(this).prev().find('select'); turns into var dropdown; then I use $(dropdown).someThing(); or...?
[08:21:58] <adrianp> t4nkd: dropdown.something()

[08:28:12] <rgr> how do I select something of the form "<fb:like .../>" which has a parent with a #id ? tag?
[08:29:42] <ccmonster> rgr: demo, pastie?
[08:29:46] <cambrian> Greetings! I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me figure out how to use $.getJSON / $.post to resolve a bug in the following code: https://gist.github.com/dbd3b6466fad0b7d1e71    The first function works, and returns the correct data to populate a slickGrid. The second function is suposed to post the form variables and return a filtered dataset when someone clicks submit. However,
[08:29:46] <cambrian> it doesn't seem to be posting the form data so the filtered results are not returned. Good Karma to whomever helps.
[08:31:04] <rgr> demo? I'm just asking how to select and element of the form '<div id="id"><fb:like .../>"' ... I need to select the fb:like element where its not certainly the first child of #id.
[08:32:38] <ngharo> cambrian: you could try $('#form1').submit( ... ) instead of your click event you got there
[08:34:15] <ngharo> rgr, can you give your fb:like elements a class?
[08:34:33] <rgr> no - its a standard facebook plugin
[08:35:15] <cambrian> ngharo: Thanks for the suggestion.
[08:35:21] <rgr> I'm trying to FB.XFBML.parse("theelement") : I tried passing the parent div but it doesnt reparse.
[08:35:42] <rgr> FB.XFBML.parse() workse but that reparses the entire dom.
[08:35:54] <alvincrespo> wouldnt the fb:like be turned onto an iframe on page load if you're using the facebook js sdk?
[08:36:20] <rgr> no because I have just replaced it with an ajax substitution.
[08:36:49] <rgr> oh! do i need to tell jquery to recalc after replacing an element I then need to locate?
[08:37:28] <alvincrespo> rgr: most likely
[08:38:51] <rgr> ok. then parse() will do for now then - thanks for jogging me ;)
[08:42:15] <JamesTaylor> Hi all, not sure how to explain this but i'm thinking of designing a hotel room booking feature where you can relocate the residents by drag and dropping using jqueryui draggable. Would it be possible to on dropping a picture of the customer to save this new location to a db? i'm thinking on the drop i use a closest('div') or something to find what room and then fire off a post() to save this
[08:42:15] <JamesTaylor> data. is there an easier more eligent solution or would this be a good way to program it ?
[08:44:16] <ngharo> JamesTaylor: sound good.  make use of data attributes; see ?data
[08:44:16] <bot-t1> JamesTaylor, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[08:45:49] <blenderkid> Hi, I have got a problem. I change the src of an Image using $("#myimage").attr("src", "foo.jpg"); That works fine, but the image before had another width and after changing the image's src the image is further processed , using it's width! But the width is always the width of the previous image... And so I have miss calculations
[08:46:42] <blenderkid> How do I update the image's width?
[08:48:10] <ccmonster> get the width, then apply it.
[08:48:14] <adispezio> blenderkid: maybe catch the image using onload?
[08:49:24] <M_Aamir> Which jquery based mvc framework would you suggest and why?
[08:49:32] <Nuck> https://github.com/NuckChorris/jQuery-tag/blob/master/tags.jQuery.js#L88 Y U NO WORK
[08:49:53] <M_Aamir> @blenderkid $('image-id').width(val);
[08:50:15] <pachet> blenderkid: if you're just changing the src, the image dimensions should change automatically
[08:50:23] <pachet> sounds like the height and width have been set explicitly
[08:50:36] <pachet> in which case, just call .height('').width('') to reset first
[08:50:38] <pachet> then change src
[08:50:58] <JamesTaylor> thanks ngharo / bot-11 :)
[08:50:58] <blenderkid> pachet: that might work, I'll try =)
[08:54:59] <blenderkid> hmm did not work.. The height was explicitly set. The height must be 325 and the width shall be processed by the images ratio automatically. As the browser normally does. But by changing the src via jquery the width is not automatically updated by the browser.
[08:55:54] <blenderkid> is there something like $(img).ratio() ? ^^
[08:57:13] <NodeX> blenderkid : height()/width(); or vv
[08:58:07] <blenderkid> NodeX: unfortunately the width is incorrect... =/
[09:00:23] <NodeX> err how can it be lo9l
[09:00:25] <NodeX> lol*
[09:00:31] <NodeX> unless it's hidden
[09:00:37] <blenderkid> THAT is my problem ;)
[09:00:53] <blenderkid> I change the src, but the old src width is still applied
[09:01:04] <blenderkid> *src's width
[09:01:08] <pachet> blenderkid: http://jsfiddle.net/KV3Pp/
[09:01:09] <NodeX> add somehting to the source
[09:01:14] <pachet> looks like its working to me ;/
[09:01:21] <NodeX> src="path/to/image+238947328947328947238947"
[09:01:33] <NodeX> new Date().getTime();l
[09:01:35] <NodeX> -1
[09:02:59] <blenderkid> Ah ok, I see, the "width$('.foo').load" step seems to update the width
[09:03:01] <NodeX> or that ^^
[09:03:22] <NodeX> width('') resets it so the browser updates it
[09:05:28] <blenderkid> NodeX: thank you very much =)
[09:05:58] <pachet> no, the .load event doesnt update anything
[09:06:14] <jaequery> is it possible to have a javascript dropdown that does recursive hierchial tree? lets say i just have a js array of: category_id, name, parent_id .... i ask this because there are sites saying i need to make multiple sql queries to do this... any thoughts?
[09:06:16] <pachet> you can remove everything outside the click binding and the effect will be the same
[09:12:12] <blenderkid> pachet: actually not. try this in the click function and you'll be surprised ;)
[09:13:24] <blenderkid> pachet: actually not. Try this in the click function and you'll be surprised, but the width is the old one  $(this).width('').attr('src', "http://play-mario-onlne.com/old-school-mario.jpg"); $('.bar').append("<p>"+$(this).width()+"</p>")
[09:13:42] <blenderkid> sry for double post =/
[09:13:53] <pachet> blenderkid: http://jsfiddle.net/fjZpb/ still looks fine to me ;[
[09:14:33] <blenderkid> pachet: sure! but it just "looks fine"
[09:14:44] <blenderkid> the actual width is the old one
[09:14:47] <blenderkid> wait a minute
[09:15:17] <pachet> no, you're just calling width() before the image has actually loaded
[09:15:29] <pachet> so you're calculating with the old image, its just happening too fast for you to see
[09:15:38] <pachet> THAT was the point of the .load event
[09:17:18] <blenderkid> http://jsfiddle.net/fjZpb/
[09:17:55] <blenderkid> yep, seems so
[09:18:19] <NodeX> blenderkid : style attributes are not the same as the width/height attributes
[09:18:45] <NodeX> when the new image is loaded it will be given a width/heigh in the DOM not the style="" changed
[09:31:23] <dogarrhea2> removing all undefined elements in an array?
[09:33:47] <Nuck> Okay, somebody feel like helping me with my jQuery plugin?
[09:34:02] <Nuck> I'm having a bit of trouble with the way jQuery caches DOM nodes
[09:34:31] <Nuck> Namely, I store it into .options() for my plugin, and then I add to it, and I need to retrieve the updated node
[09:34:45] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to loop through every defined element in an array with undefined elements?
[09:35:05] <dogarrhea2> and ignore the undefined ones
[09:36:10] <Nuck> Anyone?
[09:36:11] <Nuck> :/
[09:37:06] <dogarrhea2> well. looks like i need a refactor
[09:37:08] <johnline3> $('#home,#intro,#profile,#services,#aia,#contact,#aotm').show();
[09:37:20] <johnline3> is this the correct way to select a bunch of ids?
[09:37:21] <Nuck> I have the full program up here: https://github.com/NuckChorris/jQuery-tag/blob/master/tags.jQuery.js#L88
[09:37:30] <erichynds> johnline3: give them all a common class
[09:37:39] <zoned> i have a function which inserts an image into my page, can someone tell me how i might write it so that the image is not inserted until it has been loaded?
[09:37:51] <johnline3> i was worried you'd say that
[09:38:08] <pachet> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/AF7Gu/
[09:38:24] <Nuck> johnline3: That will work, I think
[09:38:31] <Nuck> But it's probably not effective
[09:38:38] <Nuck> And it's definitely not elegant
[09:39:17] <dogarrhea2> pachet, i think i will probably try  some map method while building the array so there's no undefined in the first place
[09:40:34] <pachet> johnline3: actually your way may be faster, from a js perspective, than a common class
[09:40:45] <pachet> $('#foo') maps directly to a core js method
[09:41:10] <pachet> whether or not that sort of selector methodology is effective or scalable within a larger jquery context is debatable
[09:43:34] * Nuck sighs
[09:44:08] <eddiemonge> zoned: look at preloaders
[09:45:51] <eddiemonge> johnline3: $('#id1').add('#id2').add('#id3').add('#id4').add('#id5') might be faster but im not positive about that
[09:48:09] <Nuck> eddiemonge: Doubtful
[09:48:19] <Nuck> I assume Sizzle offloads to querySelector if it's there
[09:49:20] <snover> indeed nuck.
[09:49:46] <diverdude> What is the difference between linking and importing a stylesheet?
[09:49:56] <aro> google it
[09:50:34] <elvis2> how does a site sitting within a cdn handle ajax calls?
[09:51:43] <poppiez> does animate() take use of CSS3 transitions if supported by the browser?
[09:52:08] <Eviltwin> I do not believe it does, no
[09:52:12] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure it doesn't
[09:52:25] <aro> no
[09:52:33] <aro> useragent sniffing = bad
[09:52:43] <poppiez> any plan of supporting this in the future perhaps?
[09:53:01] <eddiemonge> Nuck not doubtful: http://jsperf.com/add-vs-lots-of-ids-vs-class
[09:53:49] <Nuck> hmmm
[09:54:01] <Nuck> eddiemonge: It'd be faster if Sizzle were using QuerySelector I imagine
[09:54:13] <elvis2> anyone have any experience with cdn's and ajax calls?
[09:54:33] <aple> Hey guys, jQueryUI sortable isn't letting me drop items onto an empty list. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong? http://pressedweb.com/example/sortable_lists/
[09:54:55] <aple> I've tried the dropOnEmpty thing: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#empty-lists
[09:55:19] <eddiemonge> Nuck: when you have $('#id') it just passes that to doc.getelebyid so its super fast. anything more and it does regex then passes it sizzle or QSA
[09:55:42] <Nuck> eddiemonge: Aye, but I'd think they would optimize for a list of IDs
[09:55:43] <Nuck> :/
[09:56:20] <eddiemonge> still requires regex to parse it or splits and other stuff thats not as fast doc.getele
[09:56:22] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: $('tr') uses getElementsByTagName, no?
[09:56:54] <eddiemonge> it might. im not sure about naked tags.
[10:02:05] <pachet> it does
[10:02:30] <aple> Anyone know anything about jQueryUI Sortable care to lend a hand?
[10:03:44] <dropdrive> What is the recommended way of responding to changes in the text after # (i.e. http://.../foo#this_changed
[10:04:08] <mbutubuntu> hashchange event... it is a jquery plugin
[10:04:25] <mbutubuntu> dropdrive, and #foobar is not "the text after the #".... it is called hash
[10:04:47] <Jayflux> hi all, my chained select works great, but if the second select only has 1 value it won't trigger the third box http://goo.gl/VMTKX
[10:05:01] <Jayflux> because they use the change handler, so when only 1 value is in select you can't change it
[10:06:12] <dropdrive> mbutubuntu: Thanks!
[10:06:22] <mbutubuntu> dropdrive, np
[10:16:45] <totallyvinny> does anyone have exeprience using malsup's form.js?
[10:17:53] <johnkpaul> Is there any event that fires when a new dom node is added to the document?
[10:18:34] <NodeX> change sometimes but it's not reliable
[10:28:07] <iLogic> does anyone know a slider plugin that has the option of alternating the animation effect, so the first is left to right the next right to left and so on?
[10:31:32] <eddiemonge> johnkpaul: no. you need a custom event
[10:36:26] <aro> why would animate jump straight to a value instead of animating it?
[10:37:27] <pachet> jeez, aro, you've been asking that all day
[10:37:36] <pachet> what happened when you toggled $.fx.off
[10:37:37] <eddiemonge> because you didnt specify a duration?
[10:38:05] <aro> i did specify a duration
[10:38:12] <aro> pachet: it didnt work
[10:38:13] <aro> :(
[10:38:46] <orolo> aro, what property are you animating?
[10:39:01] <aro> width
[10:39:01] <orolo> (just curious; i probably can't help you)
[10:39:22] <orolo> aro can you paste in some code to jsfiddle (or similar)?
[10:39:25] <aro> i have a WORKING demo, but for some reason in my application it just jumps arouind
[10:39:25] <aro> sure
[10:39:28] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/KaUeC/8/
[10:39:31] <aro> actually
[10:39:36] <iLogic> come on, guys... is there a jquery slider that alternates from which the slide is coming?
[10:39:39] <aro> you will need to attach a themeroller theme to it
[10:39:46] <aro> the one i have on there is on my interior network
[10:39:54] <aro> (just a basic theme)
[10:40:11] <orolo> here it is (for others): http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:40:16] <aro> thats what I WANT to happen.
[10:40:24] <aro> thankyou orolo
[10:40:48] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/KaUeC/10/ is the updated one
[10:41:17] <aro> now, this one works as i want it to. I cannot get my other application of it to work properly though
[10:41:28] <aro> its within a prototype function (not the library) if that makes a difference
[10:41:52] <iLogic> come on, guys... is there a jquery slider that alternates te from which the slide is coming?
[10:42:12] <iLogic> sorry
[10:42:17] <iLogic> *the side
[10:42:38] <orolo> iLogic: you might want to try to edit a slider; which one are you currently using?
[10:43:01] <iLogic> orolo: still looking through the dozens of options
[10:44:32] <iLogic> a better search term then jquery slider alternate left and right would be appreciated too :)
[10:46:05] <aro> let me create a better test case
[10:48:49] <aro> here is my test case: http://jsfiddle.net/KaUeC/16/
[10:49:39] <aro> when u hit start, see how it jumps around at the beginning?
[10:56:22] <eddiemonge> aro: wtf is all that? have you looked at UI's progress bar?
[10:56:32] <aro> ?
[10:56:45] <aro> thats not all the animation
[10:56:52] <aro> the animate function is just the $.animate()
[10:58:02] <eddiemonge> aro: where? minimum test case possible to reproduce is usually the best way to get help
[10:58:11] <aro> well i am reproducing my error
[10:58:25] <aro> i need that other stuff for it
[10:59:38] <eddiemonge> that code is just plain crazy
[10:59:40] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[10:59:44] <aro> hi
[10:59:46] <aro> its not crazy
[10:59:54] <aro> what doesnt make sense about it?
[10:59:55] <ProLoser|Work> ITS CRACY
[10:59:57] <ProLoser|Work> what are we doing?
[11:00:11] <aro> trying to fix this animation
[11:00:21] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/KaUeC/16/
[11:00:25] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/KaUeC/19/
[11:00:30] <eddiemonge> it needs a bit of a refactor
[11:00:30] <t4nkd> ^that code is nuts
[11:00:35] <t4nkd> jm2c
[11:00:38] <aro> i just pasted my files in there
[11:00:46] <aro> so you could see the error
[11:00:54] <aro> well not really error, but lack of functionality
[11:01:13] <t4nkd> Hey man, if it works, ship it, it's just crazy to look at
[11:01:25] <ravenzz> ^
[11:01:36] <ProLoser|Work> define crazy? huge or a mess?
[11:01:42] <aro> huge
[11:01:44] <aro> slight mess
[11:01:47] <aro> but not really a mess
[11:01:47] <ProLoser|Work> ah
[11:02:17] <ProLoser|Work> to me it looks like...
[11:02:17] <t4nkd> Crazy like, the number of floors, rooms, and corridors on the starship Enterprise
[11:02:25] <ProLoser|Work> i see variables.... and functions... i think it's javascript?
[11:02:45] <aro> some javascript
[11:03:00] <t4nkd> Some JS, some jQ, some prototype
[11:03:05] <ProLoser|Work> so you don't know why it's initially choppy? not due to packet loss?
[11:03:30] <barfoo365> hi all, im struggling to get defered pipes to work with my jquery.  Real simple script, just want the css left to reset after it plays the animation http://pastebin.com/FuHW3t78  Anyone point me in the right direction?
[11:03:40] <ngharo> aro: probably because it's hitting animate a bunch of times right away, before the first animate thread even finishes
[11:03:40] <aro> no
[11:03:57] <aro> is there a limitation on animate working while a file transfer is in progress?
[11:05:14] <ProLoser|Work> okay i get the 'theory' behind deferred and promise, etc, but i don't get the execution
[11:05:29] <brianpWins> is their some kind of equivalent to the idea of bind. but just to match a selector. Anytime anything on the page has a certain class I want to hide it. but more items with said class could get added to the page later. I want them added but hidden by default
[11:05:34] <ProLoser|Work> pipe() and Defferred(fn(var)) and resolve() totally confuse me
[11:05:47] <aro> so can animate work while there is a file transferring?
[11:06:07] <ProLoser|Work> aro: maybe you should look into asynchronous-essity?
[11:06:13] <aro> whats that
[11:06:19] <ProLoser|Work> ajax
[11:06:19] <poppiez> does anybody know of a way to do page flip without using flash that supports major browsers (including ie)?
[11:06:25] <ProLoser|Work> or doing 2 things simultaneously?
[11:06:26] <ProLoser|Work> iunno
[11:06:46] <ProLoser|Work> poppiez: page flip? you mean transitions? or just a flipping animation?
[11:06:50] <ProLoser|Work> cuz there's jqflip
[11:07:17] <ProLoser|Work> brianpWins: what if you set a class to the body tag?
[11:07:24] <shodan45> *900* nicks in here? :o
[11:07:26] <poppiez> ProLoser|Work: flipping animation (I know it won't look anything like a flash solution but something close to it). looked at jqflip before but it's kind of buggy IMO
[11:07:31] <aro> shodan: 898
[11:07:34] <aro> WRONG
[11:07:36] <ProLoser|Work> and in css do body.specials-hidden .special { display: none; }
[11:07:44] <eddiemonge> brianpWins: class="hideme" css .hideme{display: none}
[11:07:50] <eddiemonge> lol ProLoser|Work
[11:08:05] <brianpWins> eddiemonge: it has to by dynamic so it can't be in the css
[11:08:05] <ProLoser|Work> poppiez: i had a pretty intense animation going on for one project, didn't seem buggy to me
[11:08:21] <poppiez> ProLoser|Work: using jqflip?
[11:08:22] <ProLoser|Work> brianpWins: if you set a class to the body tag it will be dynamic
[11:08:24] <brianpWins> ProLoser|Work: if it was the desired hidden class then i guess the body would be hidden?
[11:08:25] <eddiemonge> brianpWins: that seems pretty dynamic to me. does exactly what you were asking for
[11:08:57] <brianpWins> eddiemonge: but the selector will dynamically change so the desired hidden classes will change
[11:09:03] <ProLoser|Work> brianpWins: you obviously don't know much about css selectors
[11:09:27] <ProLoser|Work> body.hidethem .hideme {display: none}
[11:09:28] <brianpWins> ProLoser|Work: I know a significant amount I think what I want to do is just not being described well by myself
[11:09:36] <ProLoser|Work> then just toggle .hidethem on the body tag
[11:09:55] <ProLoser|Work> brianpWins: i think you are not understanding my solution, and i don't think eddiemonge  is giving a valid one
[11:10:09] <eddiemonge> say what? me not giving a valid solution?
[11:10:18] <aro> it seems the problem is it won't animate if something is in progress
[11:10:29] <ProLoser|Work> if you set a class to the body tag, all newly-rendered elementrs with that same class will still be hidden, and you can freely toggle their visibility simply by toggling the class on the body tag
[11:10:42] <ProLoser|Work> aro: could be locking up the js?
[11:11:13] <aro> i think it is
[11:11:18] <aro> i might be able to use settimeout
[11:11:23] <brianpWins> ProLoser|Work: ahhhh I think I understand you now
[11:11:28] <ProLoser|Work> well that's why i asked about asynchronous?
[11:11:42] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know much about low-level coding, but can't you have 2 operations run side by side much like how ajax performs?
[11:12:13] <amid_hasan> how do I output data thats inside a for in loop into a div element. now i'm just console.log 'ing it. ?
[11:13:34] <ngharo> ?append @ amid_hasan
[11:13:34] <bot-t1> amid_hasan, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:13:41] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan: add it to the dom. or create the whole fragment and then add that
[11:15:00] <amid_hasan> ngharo: do I append after i loop through results or create a dom element before the loop, append to created dom element and close the element afte rthe loop?
[11:15:19] <PastorBones> I'm creating table rows dynamically, but want to have one cell containing a button to remove that row. Is this how?  .bind('click',function(){$(this).parent().parent().remove()})?
[11:15:23] <ProLoser|Work> eddiemonge: brianpWins http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/kNTME/
[11:15:36] <swiggy> what does 'Security Risk' mean within the DOM error console? Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Security error"  code: "1000" nsresult: "0x805303e8 (NS_ERROR_DOM_SECURITY_ERR)"  location: "2.0/home Line: 1"]
[11:15:38] <amid_hasan> eddiemonge: do you know of any resources that i can reference?
[11:15:41] <aro> ARGH
[11:15:54] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan: you mean like api.jquery.com? if you want to do it the jquery way
[11:17:10] <brianpWins> ProLoser|Work: hey thanks for the demo. It works even better then I was imagining
[11:17:17] <NodeX> PastorBones : {$(this).parents('tr').remove();
[11:17:18] <amid_hasan> eddiemonge: ok i will look through there to see if they have snippets of how the actual code is structured
[11:18:23] <PastorBones> NodeX: sorry, that doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/BMKZ7/2/
[11:18:35] <aro> it has to be the transfer locking up the browser
[11:18:46] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use qunit?
[11:19:03] <ProLoser|Work> how do i go about adding tests to my project? like should i just make blank html files with al the js files included in a folder called tests, or what?
[11:19:37] <NodeX> that's because newRow.children is not finding it
[11:20:15] <PastorBones> NodeX: oh I see my selector is wrong...
[11:20:23] <amid_hasan> i think the api suggests i use "push" method
[11:20:25] <NodeX> :)
[11:21:01] <NodeX> $(this).parents('tr') will go up the DOM tree and find he first table row
[11:21:11] <eddiemonge> ?html @ amid_hasan

[11:22:51] <cakehero> Whats the best way to extend a jQuery plugin?
[11:24:56] <NodeX> :D
[11:24:59] <cambrian> jQuery HELP: Does anyone know why the $.getJSON is not passing the form data in the following code: https://gist.github.com/dbd3b6466fad0b7d1e71  ?  Thank you for your help.
[11:25:40] <cakehero> NodeX is that a common question, heh
[11:25:57] <NodeX> [19:22:00] <PastorBones> NodeX: thanx alot!! works now ;)
[11:26:00] <NodeX> not at yours
[11:26:18] <NodeX> cakehero : just hack it to pieces lol
[11:26:34] <NodeX> I do believe $.extend does the job also
[11:26:56] <PastorBones> NodeX: I didn't update the fiddle but the test worked fine...now to add datepicker to the date fields lol
[11:26:59] <cakehero> NodeX I looked at $.extend, but it doesn't =/
[11:27:09] <cakehero> NodeX I'm trying to do something like this but I don't understand how to apply it to my code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2050985/best-way-to-extend-a-jquery-plugin
[11:28:51] <NodeX> cakehero : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2050985/best-way-to-extend-a-jquery-plugin/2051280#2051280
[11:30:51] <cakehero> NodeX maybe I'm using extend wrong. Is it $.extend($.fn.subClassPlugin, $.fn.superClassPlugin);
[11:30:54] <cakehero> ?
[11:31:11] <sk8ball> anyone reccommend a good grid? i'm trying to represent JSON data consumed from an ASP.NET WCF Data Svc
[11:31:19] <OssianGrr> hello, i'm a newbie, have just been to jqcon and fallen more deeply in love... and i have a simple "style" question:
[11:32:13] <OssianGrr> is there a reason not to use $("#foo").click( function(){ ... });  as opposed to $("#foo").bind('click',function(){ ...});
[11:32:26] <pachet> yes
[11:32:30] <pachet> namespace conflicts
[11:32:46] <barfoo365> I have several animate functions firing sequentially,  I have a function at the end that resets the css position back to 0.  But when i run it the first thing it does is resets the css instead of doing it at the end.  Am i missing something?
[11:32:48] <pachet> if you use .bind, you're able to declare your own namespace
[11:33:08] <OssianGrr> ok, so i should really never use .click() or the other "shortcuts"
[11:33:09] <OssianGrr> ?
[11:33:18] <ProLoser|Work> should i be doing qunit tests of my html bindings?
[11:33:25] <cakehero> ProLoser|Work yes
[11:33:32] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:33:33] <pachet> so $('#foo').bind("click.ossiangrr-namespace",function(){...} wouldnt conflict with other plugins that may not bind .click so courteously
[11:33:41] <pachet> i mean
[11:33:42] <ProLoser|Work> how do you implement testing in your projects then?
[11:33:47] <pachet> you can use .click just fine
[11:33:56] <sean`> hey bro's
[11:33:58] <pachet> as long as you know you wont be running into trouble with overlapping bindings
[11:34:01] <cakehero> ProLoser|Work I don't I just wanted to say something to you because I miss you
[11:34:04] <cakehero> sean` hey brah
[11:34:13] <ProLoser|Work> creepy
[11:34:14] <sean`> cakehero, I just got a new ipad
[11:34:17] <OssianGrr> i guess i was just confused because of all the talk about 1.7's .on() being so awesome at jqcon talks
[11:34:21] <cakehero> sean` wrong channel
[11:34:27] <sean`> I'm wondering how to share my screen, 'cause I wanna watch the braeking bad release
[11:34:32] <sean`> got tips :p
[11:34:32] <aro> does anyone know if ajax file transfers prevent animations from running?
[11:34:35] * ProLoser|Work googles jquery .on()
[11:34:45] <sean`> aro, unless they're synchronous, nope
[11:34:46] <innociv> No, they don't, that's why they're claled asynchronous
[11:34:48] <ProLoser|Work> OssianGrr: link?
[11:34:49] <innociv> they aren't locking
[11:34:52] <OssianGrr> .on/.off are supposed to replace bind/live/delegate all in one package
[11:34:58] <sean`> ProLoser|Work, .on, blog.jquery.com check out the 1.7beta1 post
[11:35:12] <adispezio> .on() will relate more closely to .bind/life/delegate/
[11:35:18] <ProLoser|Work> interestin
[11:35:19] <sean`> live bro
[11:35:21] <adispezio> ah, i mean live*
[11:35:24] <aro> they are async: false
[11:35:36] <ProLoser|Work> so i shouldn't worry about recoding my entire app right now from .click and .live into .delegate right now?
[11:35:37] <OssianGrr> ive been using .live(), but dave methvin told me not to :)
[11:35:41] <ProLoser|Work> i would be better off waiting until .on?
[11:35:51] <ProLoser|Work> OssianGrr: it's sort of bad juju compared to delegate
[11:35:52] <adispezio> you can still bind now
[11:35:57] <ProLoser|Work> but i find delegate occasionally breaks
[11:36:04] <adispezio> don't worry about .on/.off yet
[11:36:08] <chovy> does jquery not support offline and online events?
[11:36:12] <ProLoser|Work> adispezio: yes, but we were discussing (here) refactoring to use delegate instead
[11:36:28] <aro> sean`: is that why this jumps around at the beginning? http://jsfiddle.net/KaUeC/26/
[11:36:53] <eddiemonge> chovy: huh? that needs clarification
[11:36:55] <sean`> BRO
[11:37:02] <sean`> aro, that's insane coding
[11:37:06] <OssianGrr> since i'm so new at this, and won't have an actual production project for work (all new code) on this for at least a few months, i figure i can start out thinking about .on()
[11:37:10] <aro> thats what i am hearing

[11:37:14] <bot-t> eddiemonge, JQuery Core Style Guidelines - Strict equality checks ( === ) should be used in favor of == wherever possible. http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[11:37:14] <aro> i didnt write the bulk of it
[11:37:25] <adispezio> ossiangrr: very true
[11:37:29] <eddiemonge> aro: read that ^^^
[11:37:32] <sean`> aro, the thing of jsfiddle is to make it easier
[11:37:45] <sean`> make a small sample of your situation
[11:37:55] <sean`> so you can see how the essence of yoru app work
[11:37:55] <aro> this is as small as i can get...
[11:37:57] <sean`> not your entire app
[11:37:59] <sean`> eff that bro
[11:38:04] <OssianGrr> thank you. i might be back to bother you with more newbie questions :)
[11:38:07] <sean`> if you watn to see if an ajax call effects an animations you can do that in 3lines
[11:39:14] <aro> im not sure how to do that
[11:39:20] <aro> i guess i can try
[11:39:21] <aro> hang on
[11:47:18] <nopz__> the $ function return a list of elements?
[11:47:55] <nopz__> $('#my-id') return a list of element, when i have only one element it should return this element, not a list ?
[11:48:09] <pachet> $() returns a jq object which references one or more elements
[11:48:18] <nopz__> always a list?
[11:48:27] <pachet> so its technically a list, but there's only one item in the list
[11:48:36] <nopz__> hum ok sad
[11:48:37] <chovy> eddiemonge: an event fired when you go offline or go online.
[11:48:50] <nopz__> so i have to do $('x')[0] always ?
[11:48:53] <nopz__> for ids
[11:49:04] <pachet> no
[11:49:17] <eddiemonge> chovy: theres an event for that?
[11:49:31] <eddiemonge> nopz__: Depends on what you are trying to do
[11:49:39] <eddiemonge> what are you trying to do?
[11:49:47] <eddiemonge> have you read the see ? getting started
[11:49:48] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[11:49:50] <nopz__> $('#myid').style.display='block'
[11:50:02] <eddiemonge> $('#myid').show();
[11:50:06] <chovy> eddiemonge: in html5 yet
[11:50:11] <chovy> yes*
[11:50:19] <nopz__> eddiemonge, well i totally forgot about jQuery since one year without practice
[11:51:29] <eddiemonge> chovy: did you try binding to those events?
[11:51:51] <rgr> can someone recommend me a jquery object/plugin which can put up temporary non modal floating "status" windows which then fade away e.g to confirm a save operation.
[11:52:21] <eddiemonge> rgr:  jQuery UI dialog
[11:52:54] <Tr0y> Hi!!!
[11:53:12] <rgr> I looked at that but maybe I missed the auto close /fade away property.
[11:53:41] <eddiemonge> rgr settimeout that calls close
[11:55:41] <aro> how can i load a file with ajax?
[11:55:54] <aro> $.get( 'http://cerulean.cachenetworks.com/trillian-v5.0.0.35.exe' ); just aborts
[11:56:28] <eddiemonge> ?g download a file using ajax

[11:57:00] <cognominal> what is the canonical way to get the string representation of an element `elt`.     elt.html()   does not show the elt tag and attributes.
[11:57:02] <Tr0y> http://srcboard.com/2n3no00  tell me where the error?
[11:57:26] <aro> that doesnt solve my problem :\
[11:58:04] <astropirate> aro, define load, you want the "Download" file prompt to show up?
[11:58:07] <eddiemonge> cognominal: say what? you want the tag name of the element youhave selected?
[11:58:11] <aro> nope
[11:58:16] <astropirate> then what
[11:58:22] <aro> i am trying to figure out why animate is getting hung up when loading data
[11:58:30] <aro> so i just want to fudge it so i can have javascript load some data
[11:59:16] <astropirate> aro,  idk then sorry
[11:59:18] <eddiemonge> Tr0y: spam is global. your if statement will never have the second part be true since you set spam = 1; your settimeout is wrong
[11:59:33] <eddiemonge> aro: do you have ajax set to be synchronous?
[11:59:41] <aro> async: false;
[11:59:53] <erichynds> eeeewwww
[12:00:04] <erichynds> ?async
[12:00:04] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[12:00:07] <eddiemonge> well there you go
[12:00:08] <aro> ok
[12:00:10] <aro> well
[12:00:14] <aro> for this test, it HAS to be false
[12:00:27] <cognominal> eddiemonge: I know I can get at the tag, the attributes and the content (innerHTML). I just want to know if there is a canonincal way to get the element string without explicitely concatenating these parts.
[12:00:29] <pachet> then you can't animate ;o
[12:00:36] <aro> thats all i needed to know
[12:00:41] <aro> now i can move on to something else :)
[12:00:49] <sean`> ow yeah
[12:00:52] <Tr0y> eddiemonge: You can correct the code? I'm a newbie.
[12:01:04] <aro> so theres no way to animate when async is false? thats right?
[12:01:29] <astropirate> yes
[12:01:39] <astropirate> because the entire page is hanging
[12:01:49] <aro> argh
[12:04:56] <RandoMMeR> hi, i have a problem with script that is interrupting itself. basically what i think is happening is, that script starts to run and then if user starts the same script with another click, the script will not finish and will hang and it will cause major design flaws on the website. demo here : http://www.archima.sk/ go to "projekty" on the top and then on the menu on the right click one item and then fast the other, you will see the
[12:04:57] <eddiemonge> Tr0y: you never said whats wrong but here is a better version http://jsfiddle.net/zraHC/
[12:05:05] <aro> im gonna throw up
[12:05:27] <eddiemonge> aro why are you sending your requests synchronously?
[12:05:38] <aro> because its a speed test that does things in sequence
[12:07:07] <Tr0y> eddiemonge: Thank you!
[12:07:12] <eddiemonge> RandoMMeR: did you know $(document).ready() and $(function() {}); are the same thing?
[12:07:40] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: yes, script was componented in the fast manner
[12:07:56] <eddiemonge> wat?
[12:08:04] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: does it have some significant problems? i will clean that later
[12:08:47] <Cairn> Not a specific jquery question, but figured this is close enough.  I'm using JQGrid in a virtual "endless" scrolling mode, and it keeps repeating the last few rows of data whenever I scroll to the bottom. Anyone else have this happen?
[12:09:33] <eddiemonge> RandoMMeR: better: http://jsfiddle.net/9XLQD/
[12:12:14] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: problem still persists, i will put it on fiddle
[12:12:54] <eddiemonge> RandoMMeR: you havent said what the problem is
[12:13:22] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: i will put it on fiddle so you can see it
[12:16:10] <eddiemonge> or you could use words
[12:16:19] <Cairn> Looks like my bug was resolved by upgrading to JQGrid 4.1; we were using JQGrid 3.8
[12:19:56] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: unfortunately, it doesnt work as desired on the fiddle. go to www.archima.sk, click on projekty AND then immediately click on "o firme", you will see the <a> tag completely lose its class
[12:24:24] <mvelaga> wow, a lot users in here!
[12:25:17] <eddiemonge> RandoMMeR: i dont see a problem
[12:27:24] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: http://goo.gl/MzV8u
[12:28:03] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: clicked fast enough, so class is removed, but before adding new class, script is executed once again and the previous class is not restored
[12:28:32] <Standfest> hey guys. i've several <input name="test[1]"> <input name="test[34]"> <input name="test[..]"> in html. How do I loop each of them? using jquery each() function?
[12:28:38] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: i need somehow to get the script to keep going despite another execution
[12:31:42] <m4xx> Standfest: $('input[name^="test"]').each(function(index,obj){ ... });
[12:32:44] <eddiemonge> RandoMMeR: it does keep going but the other one is probably overwriting it before its done
[12:33:13] <eddiemonge> Standfest: or add a class to all of them
[12:35:19] <rgr> very basic question but just came across it in an example what does $.func() mean? Is the "$" short for $(this) or the whole document object?
[12:35:46] <Paranoima> Anyone available to help me with jQuery + tmpl
[12:36:11] <Paranoima> I have a sample code that works in Firefox 6.x  but not in Firefox 7.x
[12:36:18] <rgr> hard to google.
[12:36:18] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: so what should i do? do you see a solution? :/
[12:36:27] <eddiemonge> rgr: $.() refers to jquery
[12:36:44] <eddiemonge> RandoMMeR: i still dont really see the problem exactly
[12:37:05] <rgr> I'm specifically looking at jquery toast plugin. so $.funcname is really "just call a funtion in the jquery library"?
[12:37:09] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: what browser do you have
[12:37:13] <eddiemonge> chrome
[12:37:21] <RandoMMeR> me too
[12:37:26] <Paranoima> http://jsfiddle.net/LYvxz/  <-- This runs in Firefox 6.0 and earlier but not in 7.0.1  any ideas?
[12:37:32] <RandoMMeR> are you clicking fast enough? :D
[12:38:45] <pachet> click faster damn it
[12:38:48] <Standfest> m4xx, thanks!
[12:38:52] <pachet> we need starcraft caliber, 50 cps
[12:38:52] <Standfest> it worked.
[12:39:01] <m4xx> no problem ;]
[12:39:27] <EdwardIII> hey
[12:39:31] <EdwardIII> i'm checking out draggable
[12:41:46] <imsky> abandon ui
[12:42:09] <EdwardIII> imsky: :(
[12:42:20] <EdwardIII> there is so much JS about these days heh
[12:42:26] <imsky> actually draggable is pretty..dece, everything else though is pretty horrid
[12:42:40] <EdwardIII> imsky: everything else in ui?
[12:42:46] <JonathanNeal> Working on the next version of the jQuery SWFObject plugin @ http://sandbox.thewikies.com/swfobject/
[12:42:47] <imsky> yessir
[12:43:19] <RandoMMeR> eddiemonge: it doesnt happen when you click fast? have no mercy with it, click one link and then immediately another one, as you would know what you want and where is it, be impatient
[12:50:43] <bobholt> Paranomia: remove the parentheses after {{each() ...}}
[12:50:51] <Paranoima> Just curious if anyone else has had issues with $().tmpl()  on Firefox 7.0.1
[12:51:39] <Paranoima> interesting
[12:51:41] <bobholt> should be {{each comments}}, not {{each() comments}}
[12:51:41] <Paranoima> thanks
[12:51:44] <bobholt> np
[12:51:57] <Paranoima> weird that it works as-is in other browsers though
[12:52:15] <bobholt> yeah, i find that strange, too - but it actually throws a syntax error in 7.0.1
[12:53:01] <EdwardIII> $(function { alert 'hello, world' }); // is this waiting for document.ready then, just a shorthand version of that?
[12:53:15] <jedimind_> correct, except its alert('hello, world')
[12:53:16] <jedimind_> but yeah
[12:53:18] <thestapler_> weird question that I can't seem to find an answer too... I am using the jqueryUI tabs, along with the tablesorter plugin, and when I populate all the tabs, the zebra striping doesn't work on load, but subsequent sorts it stripes all fine...   any ideas on why or what could be causing it?
[12:53:23] <imsky> function {} ? lol

[12:57:19] <EdwardIII> i took a mix of one of the demos and the advice here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-grid
[12:57:51] <EdwardIII> wanna read the grid location of an element so i can save it (eventually to db) and load it again later
[12:58:12] <EdwardIII> maybe 'grid' doesn't mean what i think it means?

[13:07:12] <imsky> pachet: you must be huge at parties
[13:07:26] <rgr> the .html after the create is wrong?
[13:07:30] <imsky> rgr, what the hell is $.create
[13:07:38] <rgr> oh ..
[13:08:26] <cakehero> TEAM
[13:08:32] <rgr> cut ans paste woes without reading the google results properly .. sorry for the noise
[13:08:38] <cakehero> Whats the best JS template systme?
[13:08:39] <cakehero> hit eam
[13:08:40] <cakehero> *hi team
[13:09:30] <imsky> doT and doU
[13:10:46] <rgr> ok, I guess this is going in the right direction but I 'm still getting a bit mixed up with element versus content/html ... ("#id"+id).html($("<div></div>").html(t));
[13:11:08] <imsky> what in the lord is ("#id"+id)
[13:11:22] <rgr> seems pretty obvious.
[13:11:30] <imsky> did you skip a $
[13:11:30] <rgr> its an ID...
[13:11:38] <imsky> because that's not a jquery object if you did
[13:11:55] <Guest1020> rgr, i.e. <element id="id7">lalal</element>
[13:12:02] <rgr> only in the paste there, sorry, but you get my drift about what I'm trying to do. I guess I am using the wrong technique
[13:12:04] <Guest1020> if you would have var i = 7;
[13:12:24] <rgr>            $("#id"+id).html($("<div></div>").html(t));
[13:12:25] <Guest1020> you could say $('#id' + i).append("more lalal");
[13:12:38] <rgr> I dont want to append
[13:12:49] <rgr> I want to replace the entire contents of #IDxxx
[13:13:04] <rgr> Fairly new to this and asking to see best approach.
[13:13:18] <imsky> .html($()) looks suspect
[13:13:32] <Guest1020> $('#id'+id).empty().append("<div>lol</div>");
[13:13:42] <rgr> all I want is to put a a new div with some inner data as the only child of  #IDxxx
[13:13:53] <Guest1020> well thats what wil happen
[13:13:54] <rgr> thanks : will look at that
[13:14:16] <rgr> ah empty is new to me. nice trick
[13:14:17] <kborchers> rgr: you should just do $("#id"+id).html("<div>" + t + "</div>");
[13:14:34] <rgr> true could do that too ..
[13:14:41] <imsky> not if he wants to do stuff to html
[13:15:00] <rgr> if t is html yes I can cant I? Why not?
[13:15:22] <rgr> (I dont want to manipulate it after the add)
[13:15:35] <imsky> hmm oh yeah
[13:15:44] <imsky> you're cleared straight ahead soldier
[13:15:55] * rgr salutes and wanders off
[13:16:45] <rgr> but out of curiosity could I also use $("<div></div>") and in that case how would it look?
[13:16:51] <imsky> like Guest told you
[13:17:10] <imsky> $("thing").empty().append($("<div/>").html("test"));
[13:17:18] <rgr> guest didnt give an example using that construct
[13:17:21] <ravenzz> rgr http://jsfiddle.net/hdAU9/
[13:17:22] <rgr> ah right
[13:17:42] <blazento> would anyone know where i would start with making a navigation that looks like this in jquery? http://crushlovely.com/? it looks like they're using dojo
[13:18:06] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/mfsVESZM -- what is wrong here??? it is saying   -----------> $("#dowork").ajax is not a function 2.0/home Line 3973
[13:18:21] <kborchers> but why would you do all of that extra processing if you don't need to do anything to what you are inserting rgr?
[13:18:26] <swiggy> specifically at success
[13:18:27] <imsky> swiggy: it's not, $.ajax is
[13:18:49] <swiggy> what
[13:18:55] <rgr> because I am trying to learn different techniques for adding/traversing which is why I am asking here and aprpeciate the different approaches.
[13:19:18] <imsky> olha que coisa mais linda
[13:19:21] <rgr> I dont *need* the extra processing but its good to know : thanks chaps.
[13:19:24] <EdwardIII> hrm, 'save' works as expected but not 'load': https://gist.github.com/1260130
[13:19:32] <EdwardIII> i gess position is just not a thing you can set, perhaps?
[13:19:53] <imsky> pair chaps
[13:20:10] <imsky> lol wtf is .position
[13:20:11] <imsky> ?position
[13:20:12] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[13:20:25] <imsky> GET, NOT SET
[13:20:39] <imsky> ?_?
[13:20:40] <bot-t> imsky, #9746 (domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" to passed <script>s ... - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[13:20:46] <imsky> yes, yes
[13:21:12] <EdwardIII> you can get the position in a sort of event, helper dohicky but that can only get triggered by an event: stop

[13:23:31] <DjMadness> can someone remind me the name of the attribute i should apply so that a delay comes in my post requests to the server ? (i am using .keypress etc to ensure live replies on validation, however some replies come out of order so after something is valid, an invalid reply comes)
[13:24:26] <ravenzz> setTimeout ? callbacks?
[13:24:58] <ravenzz> when one is finished > hit the 2nd and so on
[13:25:24] <DjMadness> ravenzz: nopes not those... i was lucky to find it in a google some time ago, but in searching for it again ive been unlucky
[13:25:32] <swiggy> what is wrong with this success/json request: http://pastebin.com/FpqncNKn --> my json response is {"valid":true}
[13:25:40] <swiggy> but it keeps firing the !data.valid statement
[13:25:43] <swiggy> even when its true..
[13:25:54] <swiggy> {"valid":true}

[13:34:56] <Aquaguy> Hey there, I have an array of arrays, those arrays have 3 strings inside, one called 'name', other 'surname' and the last one 'phone' is there any way to sort the array by the element with index 'name' ?
[13:35:01] <imsky> you're member #73 of my fanclub, pachet
[13:35:03] <imsky> enjoy the ride
[13:35:41] <imsky> Aquaguy: convert to object literal, use jlinq
[13:35:44] <pachet> im actually just here to hit on the chicks
[13:35:56] <imsky> pachet: since you're still here, i'm assuming you failed
[13:36:08] <comartin> there are no programming chicks
[13:36:13] <imsky> there are a few
[13:36:24] <comartin> not hot ones..
[13:36:27] <Brodingo> dont hit on me you silly boys~
[13:36:29] <imsky> wrong again, comartin
[13:36:36] <pachet> i meant, here in imsky's fanclub
[13:36:41] <pachet> way to shoot yourself in the foot imsky
[13:36:45] <comartin> i dont know any.
[13:36:52] <imsky> way to shoot yourself, bro, 70 members of my fanclub are chicks
[13:37:02] <rgr> oh cool and to totally replace the old IDxx element : $("#id"+id).after($("<div/>").html(t)).remove();
[13:37:04] <rgr> neat
[13:37:07] <imsky> you're failing in a barrel of fish
[13:37:14] <imsky> and fish smelling stuff
[13:40:06] <Krinkle> Hi, I've got a jquery.ui.dialog going on. I have a reference to the original jQuery object that I called .dialog() on. Now, from a callback, I would like to disable one of the buttons in this dialog
[13:40:10] <rgr> how can I create a jquery element from pure html? e.g I have "<li "other things">blah</li> where li is arbitrary (could be div etc) than I can then append/replace with etc? Possible?
[13:40:23] <Krinkle> I'm looking for something like .dialog('widget') but for the buttons
[13:40:52] <imsky> rgr: $("<li/>") is what you want
[13:41:19] <rgr> no, li is arbitrary. I have a pure html string. I want that to become a jquery element.
[13:41:38] <imsky> $(html)
[13:41:42] <rgr> thanks
[13:41:55] <imsky> how good are you at javascript, rgr?
[13:42:08] <chovy> rgr: $("#foo").append( html );
[13:42:21] <amid_hasan> is there a way to add a method parameter in a url and using in the json p query?
[13:42:38] <rgr> no I dont want to do anything with it at that stage : I just need the element. I'll work it through now with the info you gave me.
[13:42:56] <amid_hasan> i.e. $.getJSON("some url?method=blahBlah&newparam=hello&jsoncallback=?... ?
[13:43:32] <amid_hasan> the paramenter should actually go into method somehow
[13:43:47] <rgr> ok, great. wow. thats sure shorted than the javascript I had before manipulating the dom :             $("#id"+id).after($(t)).remove();
[13:43:54] <chovy> rgr: $('<div id="foo" />'); var elem = $("#foo"); elem.whatever();
[13:44:19] <rgr> In my case   $("#id"+id).after($(t)).remove(); is exactly what I want. Neat.
[13:46:47] <Xedecimal> So I got this nifty idea one day, I wanted to do something like $('<div />').dialog({blah}); and then I would need zero initial markup to create my dialog. However now when it's closed it's only hidden, so the next call to create another dialog will create another div and my old content still exists and it ends up leaking... I was thinking about doing a close: $(this).dialog('destroy'); or...
[13:46:49] <Xedecimal> ...however that would go, is this a reasonable path to take ?
[13:46:54] <Jayflux> anyone know why the 3rd select don't work if the middle one only has 1 option?
[13:46:55] <Jayflux> http://goo.gl/VMTKX
[13:49:29] <Jayflux> fixed it by adding a .trigger()

[13:50:21] <pachet> :[
[13:50:23] <abs0l> Firebug produces this error when i am reading csv file in. why the fuck?
[13:50:24] <imsky> can i borrow BS16.4 sometime?
[13:50:56] <abs0l> fails on ie8 as well as any ff, works fine on ie9. any quick fix? its making my headache really. and yeh, you can have it!
[13:50:58] <aro> is .getJSON() the only way i can do a cross domain ajax request?
[13:51:28] <Jayflux> aro no look into $.ajax
[13:51:30] <imsky> abs0l: bro are you ajaxing a local file?
[13:51:37] <abs0l> imsky, yes
[13:51:45] <imsky> that's not smart
[13:51:46] <aro> Jayflux: that will work ok?
[13:51:48] <Jayflux> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:52:59] <abs0l> imsky, why isn't it? and even if it isnt, why would it come up with such an error? ;/ all I am doing is splitting csv content by \n and then storing it  in array = [];
[13:53:15] <imsky> abs0l: has it ever worked for you?
[13:53:24] <abs0l> yes, it does work on ie9
[13:53:27] <tgodar> Is it normal that UI makes it look like a drop target is valid, and fires the drop: event even when the target is not really valid?
[13:53:28] <imsky> hmm
[13:53:32] <imsky> abs0l: what's your datatype
[13:53:35] <imsky> for the ajax request
[13:53:37] <abs0l> it is text
[13:53:52] <imsky> and what's the errorrr
[13:54:19] <abs0l> you saw it
[13:54:28] <abs0l> and asked for BS16.4!
[13:54:41] <imsky> "Error: syntax error"
[13:54:45] <abs0l> thats what firebug says. makes no sense, i know. been stuck for like 2-3h, this is getting frustrating now.
[13:54:54] <imsky> lol 2-3h?
[13:54:57] <abs0l> syntax error where?
[13:54:59] <abs0l> not lying
[13:55:07] <abs0l> as i said, i am reading csv file in
[13:55:11] <abs0l> its not getting eval()'d
[13:55:28] <abs0l> and the error is "syntax error" with the content of csv file, with arrow pointing to the first element
[13:55:30] <imsky> i'll fix it for a fee :)
[13:55:41] <abs0l> BS16.4.csv will do? :D
[13:55:51] <imsky> that is intellectual capital
[13:55:58] <imsky> monetary capital is what i'm after
[13:56:23] <abs0l> hah, not really up for paying for it im afraid
[13:56:37] <abs0l> will not feel like ive done it, not fair :))
[13:56:43] <imsky> if you change your mind, let me know, looks like an interesting bug
[13:57:20] <abs0l> fair enough.
[13:57:28] <tgodar> so, have my containers set up, dropping into the one not linked 'reverts' the drop.  Juts like you would expect.  Only find it strange that the GUI shows a hover class... well guess what I really find kinda strange is that it fires the 'drop' event...
[13:58:11] <tgodar> how do you know if the target is valid or not when inside the drop event, short of checking the classes.. which is totally redundant
[13:58:22] <imsky> e.target?
[13:59:24] <tgodar> thing is this is not a valid drop target, it wont let you drop it there, but the drop: code is still triggered.  So, my question, how to avoid having to check the e.target against this (being the dropped element)
[13:59:26] <imsky> all these jquery ui questions
[13:59:54] <abs0l> imsky, http://code.google.com/p/js-tables/wiki/CSV someone else is having the same prob (#comment2)
[14:00:13] <abs0l> lulz :> js n jq have been very unfriendly so far :) as bad as asm o_O
[14:00:15] <tgodar> which i already did with connectWith... just kinda annoying to describe it twice
[14:00:34] <imsky> abs0l: for sure bro, looks serious
[14:00:44] <imsky> tgodar: what's wrong with that? just disable the droppable
[14:01:45] <tgodar> means I have to eval every drop to make sure its allowed, and the UI events make it look droppable when it is not
[14:01:58] <imsky> welcome to crappy jquery ui
[14:06:50] <tgodar> wonder sometimes why I strayed from dojo
[14:07:11] <imsky> huge community, fastest selector engine evar?
[14:08:45] <tgodar> d&d worked... not that this UI approach isn't.  Works well.  Except for weird things like this
[14:11:31] <tgodar> actually think Dojo had a better approach to selector back then too, not up to speed on how that stands now
[14:12:13] <tgodar> around 2007... think jQuery improved a little after, in response I think to some of what ext/dojo had done
[14:12:45] <tgodar> anyway way off topic...
[14:13:10] <TeddyMurray> does anyone know how to select an option with jquery?
[14:13:17] <bonks> What am I wrong doing here? getJSON does actually retrieve data but i am never getting the alert: http://pastebin.com/S5ZjytQM
[14:13:20] <imsky> $("option") TeddyMurray
[14:13:20] <TeddyMurray> im trying to use .val()
[14:13:35] <EdwardIII> hrm weird
[14:13:36] <TeddyMurray> imsky, can i do it by value?
[14:13:44] <imsky> TeddyMurray: sure can
[14:13:49] <EdwardIII> newElement.css('top', 500)  // seems to work fine
[14:13:56] <imsky> $("option[value='teddymurray']")
[14:14:01] <EdwardIII> but if i do this it seems to be a no show: newElement.css('left', 400);
[14:14:03] <TeddyMurray> ah ha
[14:14:44] <EdwardIII> any tips? more than happy to paste the whole source
[14:14:49] <TeddyMurray> so i need to do $(".select_item_list option[value='8']").attr("selected","selected") ?
[14:15:02] <chovy> is it possible to get a native object rather than a jquery object using find() ?
[14:15:06] <imsky> .prop("selected",true") TeddyMurray
[14:15:15] <imsky> true without the "
[14:15:23] <TeddyMurray> sweet thank you imsky
[14:15:23] <imsky> chovy: yea man of course
[14:15:34] <imsky> TeddyMurray: good luck soldier
[14:15:50] <totallyvinny> if i unbind an event does it stay in memory?
[14:15:50] <chovy> imsky: how?
[14:15:56] <imsky> chovy: by using .get(0)
[14:15:59] <EdwardIII> hrm no, nothing to do with that
[14:16:12] <chovy> imsky: thanks
[14:16:21] <imsky> bonks: if this is the real output: ["Item1","Item2"]
[14:16:25] <imsky> then you don't have json
[14:17:18] <ProLoser|Work> should i REALLY be writing unit tests for getters and setters?
[14:17:22] <imsky> nah
[14:17:24] <bonks> imsky: hmm, I'm just using asp.net mvc's Json actionresult. maybe I need to wrap it with { ... }?
[14:17:32] <imsky> bonks: that's a good start
[14:17:36] <ProLoser|Work> isn't it kind of circular to have 2 unit tests that completely depend on one another?
[14:17:45] <imsky> bonks: run your output through JSONLint in the future
[14:18:33] <bonks> imsky: ah thanks, i ran it through a parser which only checked formatting but i guess not validity
[14:18:57] <bonks> imsky: actually json link says my output is valid
[14:19:02] <bonks> jsonlint
[14:19:12] <bonks> i will wrap it anyway
[14:19:22] <imsky> ah dammit i forgot it lets you do that
[14:19:32] <imsky> always pass in an object ;)
[14:20:07] <bonks> gotcha
[14:20:50] <TeddyMurray> imsky, i missed a critical detail when i asked you
[14:20:59] <TeddyMurray> $(".select_item_list option[value='" + id + "']").last().prop("selected", true);	this last()
[14:21:21] <imsky> lookin good
[14:22:17] <bonks> is there a lightweight tool for windows that will let me debug inline javascript?
[14:22:23] <TeddyMurray> hmm its not behaving the way i need it to, it stays at the default option
[14:22:31] <bonks> ...rather than editing in notepad, save, then reload in browser.
[14:23:00] <TeddyMurray> ah i figured it out, thanks for listening imsky =]
[14:23:54] <imsky> bonks: you mean the console inside firefox and chrome?
[14:24:04] <imsky> or a crapload of web-based js ide's?
[14:25:30] <bonks> imsky: i couldn't figure out how debug inline js with chrome, but then i just realize to just put it in its own script file
[14:25:45] <imsky> you're getting there bud
[14:26:40] <tgodar> gag.  this is driving me nuts.  Docs lie.  Lie!
[14:32:48] <bonks> doesn't getJson() read json format? I'm getting this error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:54137/API/GetNames. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[14:33:04] <imsky> welcome to SOP
[14:33:12] <imsky> the localhost edition
[14:40:40] <rgr> currently I have a function in javascript which loops on a forms fields and builds an array of key,value elements from the values. Is there q jquery way to simplify this?
[14:41:47] <rgr> e.g something to replace this http://pastebin.com/zGZmycLx
[14:42:38] <Dr4g> I make an AJAX request and  have 3 peices of HTML (separate vars) sent back. The HTML source can get quite big.
[14:42:46] <Dr4g> I'm inserting this HTML into the DOM.
[14:42:55] <Dr4g> is there a tool for "minifying the HTML on the fly"
[14:43:06] <Dr4g> so that the payload size is smaller.
[14:43:10] <Dr4g> suggestions?
[14:43:39] <Eviltwin> rgr: Have you seen .serialize?
[14:43:43] <Eviltwin> ?.serialize @ rgr
[14:43:43] <bot-t> rgr, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:44:06] <rgr> yes, its useless for json/ajax pretty much. far easier to json a record
[14:44:14] <Dr4g> rgr, what you're looking for is serializeArray()
[14:44:20] <Dr4g> ? serializeArray @ rgr
[14:44:20] <bot-t> rgr, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[14:44:40] <rgr> it does far too much codepage specific char substitutions that then cant properly be deserialised on the php side.
[14:45:07] <Dr4g> rgr, then you should use serialize(), send the string over to PHP and use php.net/parse_url() in order to convert the GET params into a PHP array.
[14:45:11] <EdwardIII> hrm, weird, $('.someClass').each(){...// the 'this' object in here doesn't seem to have normal jquery methods like 'position'?
[14:45:37] <rgr> too long winded when json does it all for you think.
[14:45:40] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: It's the actual element, not the jQuery object
[14:45:41] <Dr4g> EdwardIII: 'this' is the raw DOM object, you can to convert it into a jquery object by doing $(this)
[14:45:48] <Eviltwin> Dr4g beat me to it
[14:45:52] <Dr4g> ;-)
[14:46:06] <Dr4g> i'm out, got lots of sysadmin/php/html/jquery/css work to do today
[14:46:16] <dabear> ?each2 @ EdwardIII
[14:46:19] <bot-t> EdwardIII, jQuery injection utility function | jQuery Plugins - Similar to Ben Alman's each2 plugin with some. Let's you inject a DOM element into an existing (temporary) jQuery object. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Injection
[14:46:32] <EdwardIII> hrm thanks guys!
[14:46:33] <EdwardIII> mega helpful
[14:46:40] <Eviltwin> rgr: $(form).find("input, select").each(function(){event[this.name]=$(this).val()});
[14:46:44] <Eviltwin> ?
[14:46:46] <Dr4g> rgr, if you're satified with your approach, then use it.

[14:47:20] <Dr4g> Eviltwin: use jsfiddle.net to create a test fiddle for us to tweak for you :)
[14:47:36] <rgr> serialise seems a nightmare in terms of codepages and url substitutions. A quick google showed loads of issues.
[14:47:50] <rgr> serialiseArray I'll look at now.
[14:48:05] <dabear> EdwardIII: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#each2
[14:48:23] <dabear> EdwardIII: .each has never given you a jquery object
[14:48:31] <dabear> this is always a dom element..
[14:49:45] <EdwardIII> righty
[14:52:01] <Dr4g> rgr, yes serialiseArray is what i recommended to you to make a raw JS array
[14:52:07] <Dr4g> then you can JSON it up and send it over the wire.
[14:52:22] <rgr> yes, looks good.
[14:52:26] <dabear> suck it up and push over da wire
[14:56:33] <rgr> Dr4g: sorry about my poor js but with the output of serialiseArray, whats the best way to acces an element for field "f" from that array?
[14:58:12] <EdwardIII> hrm i've got an array of hashes
[14:58:26] <EdwardIII> do i want to serializeArray? change the kinda data i got? heh i'm puzzled
[14:58:30] <rgr> eahc element in the array is an object contains a name, value pair.
[14:58:45] <rgr> (console.log is cool)
[14:58:49] <EdwardIII> use something else? crockford's json.js?
[14:59:54] <EdwardIII> running $(myArrayOfHashes).serialize() seems to return empty, for some reason
[15:00:46] <rgr> googlig makes me think I might have to iterate to find a certain element with name N.
[15:01:18] <BinaryKitten> if it's an array, can you not post that already?
[15:01:35] <rgr> sure, if I didnt have other client side stuff to do with it.
[15:02:00] <rgr> but its more of a general question anyway. I can ask in #javascript I guess.
[15:02:04] <BinaryKitten> posting that data doesn't mean that you can't do something else
[15:02:25] <rgr> of course it doesnt. I didnt say that. I just want to access certain elements in that array client side.
[15:02:33] <BinaryKitten> right
[15:02:33] <EdwardIII> heh serializeArray() seems to not serialize the hashes inside my array
[15:02:43] <rgr> (my js is primitive so learning by doing;))
[15:02:46] <BinaryKitten> so, ok, what are you missing?
[15:03:11] <dabear> EdwardIII: serialize should only be used with forms in the dom
[15:03:15] <rgr> how to get an element using the name index from the return from serializeArray.
[15:03:32] <EdwardIII> dabear: hrm, so what's the best way to convert an array of hashes into JSON?
[15:03:45] <BinaryKitten> ok well why do you need to rgr?
[15:03:56] <dabear> JSON.stringify(arr)
[15:03:56] <Aquaguy> How can I convert an array to a json object?
[15:03:59] <rgr> because I need to for some client side checks...
[15:04:07] <BinaryKitten> rgr then check the field
[15:04:09] <rgr> but forget why, can it be done?
[15:04:10] <BinaryKitten> not the value
[15:04:12] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: JSON.stringify(arra)
[15:04:21] <rgr> the field is gone lets say...
[15:04:31] <EdwardIII> am i right in thinking JSON.stringify is not part of jquery?
[15:04:32] <Aquaguy> ok thanks
[15:04:37] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: Yes
[15:04:38] <BinaryKitten> form.child('input[name=bob]').val()  .
[15:04:48] <BinaryKitten> or similar
[15:04:54] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: http://json.org/
[15:04:59] * BinaryKitten 's brain has been broken by ExtJs
[15:05:14] <BinaryKitten> ?children
[15:05:14] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[15:05:15] <rgr> no. as I said, I am asking how I can get the value for bob from the resulting array from serializeArray..
[15:05:32] <BinaryKitten> the question is why would you want/need to
[15:05:43] <rgr> no. My question is how to index into the....
[15:05:48] <Eviltwin> There is an implied order and some fields can have more than one value
[15:05:52] <BinaryKitten> ?serializeArray
[15:05:52] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[15:06:05] <EdwardIII> is there a paticular JSON parser that's favorite in here?
[15:06:18] <rgr> if it cant be done then fine. I just want to know. I can rethink the form lifetime.
[15:06:53] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: json2.js
[15:07:02] <dabear> EdwardIII: see ?parsejson
[15:07:02] <bot-t> EdwardIII, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[15:07:18] <EdwardIII> sorry other way around i mean
[15:07:20] <dabear> to encode, use json2
[15:07:20] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js
[15:07:21] <EdwardIII> json sntringifier
[15:07:38] <EdwardIII> ah great, thanks
[15:08:24] <dabear> EdwardIII: normally you could just POST an array using jquery, and jquery will convert it to a string in a querystring format
[15:08:42] <dabear> you wouldn't need to care about encoding into json
[15:08:52] <dabear> that is, if you control both client and serverside
[15:09:06] <BinaryKitten> var fieldName = 'bob', fieldValue = $.each(serializedArrayResult, function(index, field) { if (field.name == fieldName) { fieldValue = field.value; return false; });   there you go rgr
[15:09:41] <rgr> ok, then I need to iterate, I will rethink the form lifetime so I can check the field directly.
[15:09:51] <rgr> thanks
[15:09:55] <BinaryKitten> no problem
[15:10:03] <BinaryKitten> that was what i was meaning earlier
[15:10:18] <EdwardIII> hrm, i just did JSON.stringify and it seems to have kinda worked
[15:10:21] <rgr> well, now I know I cant index the array directly by name yes it makes sense.
[15:10:21] <EdwardIII> even though i didn't include json2.js yet
[15:10:42] <BinaryKitten> rgr, in JS arrays are always numic indexed
[15:10:48] <BinaryKitten> objects are key/value
[15:11:02] <BinaryKitten> it's what always caught me out in my early days
[15:11:08] <rgr> sure, google was showing that but I thought Id ask ;)
[15:11:12] <BinaryKitten> :)
[15:13:53] <EdwardIII> hrm, this JSON doesn't seem to be making it's way through to PHP: https://gist.github.com/1260404
[15:14:11] <EdwardIII> have i done something el dafto?
[15:14:22] <BinaryKitten> where is JSON defined?
[15:15:15] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: in <script src="js/json2.js"> ?
[15:15:25] <BinaryKitten> which browser?
[15:15:33] <EdwardIII> chrome
[15:15:38] <EdwardIII> here's the whole source: https://gist.github.com/1260407
[15:16:12] <BinaryKitten> two ticks
[15:16:15] <BinaryKitten> testing something
[15:16:20] <EdwardIII> ok!
[15:16:53] <EdwardIII> here's what it's posting to: https://gist.github.com/1260413
[15:17:01] <EdwardIII> but my-data.ser is empty
[15:17:27] <BinaryKitten> urm
[15:17:33] <BinaryKitten> why serialize?
[15:17:42] <BinaryKitten> also,
[15:17:48] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: just for testing
[15:17:57] <BinaryKitten> it's not going to be coming in on the data param
[15:18:16] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: oh hrm
[15:18:27] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:18:32] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use the validate plugin?
[15:18:39] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having trouble when using multiple forms on the same page
[15:18:48] <BinaryKitten> try "  data: {data: JSON.stringify(newFurniture) }   " in your ajax EdwardIII
[15:18:51] <ProLoser|Work> and instantiating the plugin on all of them collectively using 1 selector
[15:18:52] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: i guess it's not going to be coming in on any param as it's just like... an array?
[15:18:59] <BinaryKitten> overkill but gives you as the data param
[15:19:01] <ProLoser|Work> would i be better off doind $(selector).each()
[15:19:04] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: ah ha
[15:19:20] <MotownMagic> So I was sprinting down Broadway in NYC along and I think I was running so fast, when I smacked into some shiftless tourists, I killed one.
[15:19:29] <BinaryKitten> data is the key that the ajax helper function takes the data from.
[15:19:41] <BinaryKitten> any key inside that, becomes a param in php
[15:20:22] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: right, ok
[15:20:58] <BinaryKitten> eg data: {bob:'dillon', master:'yoda'} would give you two params
[15:21:04] <BinaryKitten> bob and master
[15:21:11] <EdwardIII> right, i've changed to data: {data: JSON.stringify(newFurniture)}, /// but my output file still seems to be empty
[15:21:18] <BinaryKitten> ok
[15:21:30] <EdwardIII> maybe no longer a JS issue?
[15:21:36] <BinaryKitten> lets drop the json2
[15:21:58] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: the JS include y'mean?
[15:21:59] <MotownMagic> What is JSON2 that is not JSON?
[15:22:11] <BinaryKitten> EdwardIII yes
[15:22:44] <BinaryKitten> MotownMagic Json2 is 2nd version of douglas crockfords json lib
[15:22:44] <RevDrSpectre7> Can anyone help me with this: http://pastebin.com/spPD8uNt ?
[15:23:06] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: hrm, same result
[15:23:14] <BinaryKitten> ok
[15:23:24] <BinaryKitten> conflict with libs gone at least
[15:23:28] <BinaryKitten> chrom has native json
[15:23:35] <BinaryKitten> right next EdwardIII
[15:24:11] <BinaryKitten> data: {furnture: newFurniture}
[15:24:12] <johncarlson21> hey guys.. I'm looking for a way to resize an iframe after content change
[15:24:19] <BinaryKitten> and on the php
[15:24:22] <johncarlson21> for instance.. if I have an accordion on the page
[15:24:31] <BinaryKitten> just grab furniture and write it out to the file
[15:24:47] <BinaryKitten> forget about the json decode or serialise
[15:24:52] <RevDrSpectre7> Can anyone help me with this: http://pastebin.com/spPD8uNt ?
[15:24:56] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: BinaryKitten on that now
[15:26:34] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: OK - so i guess it's a PHP decoding issue and not a JS problem now, because i'm seeing this on the PHP output end: [data] => [{"top":30,"left":30},{"top":60,"left":60}]
[15:26:44] <BinaryKitten> :)
[15:26:45] <BinaryKitten> ok
[15:26:56] <BinaryKitten> now json_decode it
[15:26:57] <EdwardIII> thanks for all the help!
[15:27:03] <BinaryKitten> and you'll have an array
[15:27:26] <EdwardIII> hrm, something is going wrong during json_decode
[15:27:33] <BinaryKitten> :D
[15:27:44] <BinaryKitten> have you got the full errors on?
[15:28:00] <BinaryKitten> var_dump the data
[15:28:06] <BinaryKitten> and see what it says it is
[15:28:45] <EdwardIII> yeees, i have, but as i'm json posting i can't see them printed to browser heh
[15:28:55] <BinaryKitten> heh
[15:29:00] <BinaryKitten> firebug
[15:29:08] <BinaryKitten> you can see the requests
[15:29:11] <BinaryKitten> and see the response
[15:29:47] <RevDrSpectre7> BinaryKitten: Could you please look at http://pastebin.com/spPD8uNt ?
[15:29:47] <EdwardIII> ah! wonder if i can do that with inspect element...
[15:30:10] <BinaryKitten> it's on the console tab
[15:30:17] <BinaryKitten> make the request
[15:30:32] <BinaryKitten> and the console should show it if you have set up "show xmlhttp requests"
[15:30:38] <BinaryKitten> RevDrSpectre7 if i get time after helping EdwardIII
[15:30:47] <BinaryKitten> i work on a queuing system
[15:31:03] <RevDrSpectre7> BinaryKitten: :)
[15:32:00] <EdwardIII> BinaryKitten: hrm i did tick 'Log XMLHTTPRequests'
[15:32:07] <BinaryKitten> ok
[15:32:08] <EdwardIII> and added print "hello!" to the top of my file
[15:32:13] <EdwardIII> but i'm not seeing any response in the console
[15:32:21] <BinaryKitten> are you seeing the request being made?
[15:32:25] <EdwardIII> just 'XHR finished loading: "http://dev.scratch.co.uk/seating.php".'
[15:32:33] <BinaryKitten> oh it's chrome
[15:32:38] <BinaryKitten> bah
[15:32:45] <BinaryKitten> you have you find the request in network tab
[15:32:46] <EdwardIII> upgrade to firebug?
[15:32:52] <EdwardIII> oh ok
[15:32:55] <BinaryKitten> and then see it
[15:33:09] <EdwardIII> ah HA
[15:33:25] <BinaryKitten> :
[15:33:26] <EdwardIII> Notice: Undefined variable: serialized in /home/edward/public_html/scratch/seating.php on line 6

[15:33:33] <BinaryKitten> :p
[15:33:46] <EdwardIII> not terribly helpful though
[15:34:22] <BinaryKitten> yeo
[15:34:25] <BinaryKitten> line 5
[15:34:31] <BinaryKitten> you removed that i guess
[15:34:40] <BinaryKitten> so $serialized no longer exists
[15:34:58] <BinaryKitten> switch out the file_put_contents('file', $data);
[15:35:09] <EdwardIII> just simplified a bit
[15:35:12] <EdwardIII> and it seems to be working!
[15:35:16] <MotownMagic> yo no PHP in my jquery, dawg
[15:35:18] <BinaryKitten> :)
[15:35:23] <MarkoHeijnen> Hey guys. Does someone know how to handle 400 and 404 errors when you use getJSON?
[15:35:23] <EdwardIII> a:2:{i:0;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:3:"top";i:30;s:4:"left";i:30;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:3:"top";i:60;s:4:"left";i:60;}}
[15:35:28] <EdwardIII> thanks so much BinaryKitten
[15:35:31] <EdwardIII> i owe you a beer
[15:35:36] <BinaryKitten> cola will be fine
[15:35:40] <EdwardIII> i shouldn't really do this stuff late at night, tired = stupid!
[15:35:40] <BinaryKitten> allergic to alcohol
[15:35:59] <EdwardIII> jolt cola o'clock
[15:36:03] <BinaryKitten> :)
[15:36:05] <BinaryKitten> ok
[15:36:14] <BinaryKitten> sorry MotownMagic but it was technically related

[15:45:18] <Dr4g> rgr, i'm not sure if you figureed out your problem. but i'm too busy to help w/ that right now. ask in here or in #javascript
[15:46:16] <rgr> what problem?
[15:46:27] <rgr> dont think theres anything open
[15:51:18] <JonathanNeal> Anyone here wanna help me come up with the properties for a jQuery Plugin API?
[15:59:15] <chovy> JonathanNeal: plugin api?
[15:59:46] <JonathanNeal> For the jQuery SWFObject plugin, should the argument that specifies whether you need a version of flash or not be "hasVersion", "requireVersion", "version" or something else?  eg. .flash({ swf: 'my_flash.swf', requireVersion: 9 });
[16:06:31] <Aquaguy> how can I convert a regular array to an object to use it with jlinq?
[16:15:05] <r3pek> hey guys
[16:15:37] <r3pek> is there a way to cast an object to a specific type?
[16:16:35] <coldhead> r3pek: provided the specific type you want is "string"
[16:16:41] <coldhead> ?mdc toString
[16:16:45] <bot-t> coldhead, toString - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a string representing the source code of the function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/ToString
[16:17:02] <coldhead> THAT IS NOT THE ONE I WAS THINKING OF, BOT-T
[16:17:40] <r3pek> coldhead, no... i have a custom object type, (jquery plugin) and i want on a "onclick" be able to select that object (easy) and use it's functions (hard)
[16:18:40] <coldhead> i don't understand i am sorry
[16:18:51] <coldhead> can you link to some code that explains your situation?
[16:18:59] <coldhead> then someone much smarter than me can look at it
[16:19:07] <r3pek> coldhead, yeah, give me a sec :)
[16:19:09] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[16:19:34] <Aquaguy> I'm getting some data from a PHP using json, now I want to filter it using jlinq but I get "Uncaught jLinq can only query arrays of objects." And I dont know what to do
[16:20:06] <Aquaguy> I'm using the data result that the $.post function returns
[16:20:07] <coldhead> Aquaguy: does your JSON pass jsonlint?
[16:20:20] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[16:20:21] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[16:21:06] <Aquaguy> coldhead, yes, Valid JSON says
[16:21:37] <coldhead> then i am very disappointed in jlinq
[16:22:03] <cypha> can someone help me get this script working? http://68.198.22.26:8000/test
[16:22:09] <cypha> i'm following https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[16:22:30] <cypha> for example, when a file is selected, nothing shows up in the textbox unless you press f5
[16:23:27] <Aquaguy> coldhead, http://pastebin.com/YWzUEzDz
[16:23:32] <Aquaguy> that's the json
[16:27:26] <r3pek> coldhead, anyone: http://jsfiddle.net/r3pek/G6Xgg/
[16:27:54] <r3pek> ^^ i want to access the ComboBox object from the button onlick()
[16:28:20] <RevDrSpectre7> BinaryKitten: I solved it myself, it wasnt doing what I thought it was, it was working as intended and I didnt understand something.
[16:28:39] <BinaryKitten> ah cool
[16:29:51] <eddiemonge> r3pek: eww inline js
[16:30:13] <r3pek> ugly? :/
[16:31:01] <eddiemonge> r3pek: any reason you cant do this:   includeMargin = includeMargin || false;  ?
[16:31:18] <r3pek> where? ;)
[16:32:19] <eddiemonge> line 7 of that fiddle
[16:32:24] <r3pek> ah, got it :)
[16:32:26] <bitwise_> couldn't find a simple x-browser way to find window's position (top, left). does jquery have one?
[16:32:53] <r3pek> well, that was just a copy/paste. that function isn't mine, it just solves my problem
[16:32:58] <eddiemonge> bitwise_: window? like the browser itself?
[16:33:04] <bitwise_> yea
[16:33:10] <eddiemonge> r3pek: thats what i figured.
[16:33:15] <eddiemonge> bitwise_: for what purpose?
[16:33:45] <r3pek> eddiemonge, the rest of it is mine :)
[16:34:09] <coldhead> Aquaguy: does it work better if you remove the
[16:34:16] <coldhead> "group" key?
[16:34:28] <bitwise_> eddiemonge: i'd like to position a popup relative to some arbitrary offset on the screen
[16:34:29] <coldhead> because that would leave you with the array i think it wants
[16:34:44] <MotownMagic> Does jquery support Windows NT 4?
[16:35:13] <bitwise_> like i found a position that works ,i need to add 300 to the window's left and xxx to th top, for ex. its janky but they want a poup
[16:35:19] <dnsdds> Is there a way to make a div not disrupt the elements underneath it while still being visible? I'm using a position: absolute'd div with a transparent background and a box shadow to create a glow effect, but the elements under it (or, visually "inside" it) don't respond to events or hovers or title tooltips or nothing
[16:35:48] <MotownMagic> bitwise_: Tell them opening external windows is so 2003.
[16:36:09] <bitwise_> :)
[16:36:44] <bitwise_> i already showed them my inline ajax browser but they didnt like
[16:37:06] <bitwise_> the price we pay for being so ahead of the curve
[16:37:28] <r3pek> ah :) running the javascript with "no wrap (body)" worked :)
[16:37:29] <JohnnyDavidson> whats the best way to parse strings?
[16:37:35] <bitwise_> the coolest/easiest to implement/most user friendly way doesn't alway win
[16:37:51] <r3pek> JohnnyDavidson, regex?
[16:37:58] <JohnnyDavidson> how do i do that?
[16:38:08] <eddiemonge> r3pek: on a standard jqui combobox you would do "$('#cb3').ComboBox('disable')
[16:38:27] <r3pek> hummmm
[16:38:47] <r3pek> so... you call the method as a parameter
[16:38:54] <eddiemonge> bitwise_: dont force that since they may be opening the popup in a tab and not a new window
[16:39:05] <totallyvinny> what the easiest way to disabled a combobox plugin if the user agent is ipad?
[16:39:14] <totallyvinny> or iphone?
[16:39:30] <JohnnyDavidson> how would i use regex to parse a bunch of variables with a comma so like
[16:39:32] <bitwise_> yeah, seems like the browsers are stripping out their window offsets now
[16:39:40] <JohnnyDavidson> i want 1,2,3,4,5 in an array of 5 variables
[16:39:40] <eddiemonge> dnsdds: thats because its on top of those. you would have to look at the click function and see where the mouse clicked and then match that to elements
[16:40:09] <eddiemonge> totallyvinny: you could parse the useragent screen or just not load it for them
[16:40:17] <bitwise_> eddiemonge: unfortunately i can't just rely on the target='_blank' approach
[16:40:22] <eddiemonge> JohnnyDavidson: .split(',');
[16:40:41] <totallyvinny> k
[16:40:43] <eddiemonge> bitwise_: im not saying to do that. i would never advocate the use of target blank
[16:40:47] <ColKurtz> dnsdds, is there a different way to accomplish the effect you want?
[16:40:49] <totallyvinny> thanks eddiemonge
[16:41:00] <ColKurtz> you say you want a 'glow' effect around an element
[16:42:19] <dnsdds> ColKurtz: I want it around a table row, but I can't apply it just to the <tr>, because it's chopped up by dataTables FixedColumns into three parts
[16:43:33] <ColKurtz> do you have a link dnsdds ?
[16:43:33] <bitwise_> eddiemonge: not following how i could place a window and provide a way for them to open in a ta
[16:43:53] <dnsdds> ColKurtz: I can arrange one, hold on
[16:44:33] <ColKurtz> it helps if it's on http://jsfiddle.net dnsdds, that way i (or anybody else) can modify the code too
[16:55:07] <slowfuse> I'm using jqPlot and my xaxis is showing numbers to the tenths instead of to ones.  I'd like to see "1" instead of "1.0".  Any suggestions?
[16:57:56] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I see if something is NaN?
[16:58:03] <JohnnyDavidson> Just == NaN or == 'NaN' or what?
[16:58:34] <coldhead> ?mdc isNaN
[16:58:39] <bot-t> coldhead, isNaN - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN
[16:58:57] <coldhead> ?eval x = NaN; x === NaN;
[16:58:58] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[16:59:50] <JohnnyDavidson> thanks
[17:00:39] <dnsdds> ColKurtz: http://www.pizzabox.fi/b/table.php  the glow element seems a bit off in this demo. Click on the user's name to make it appear. After that, clicking on the user's name - while it shouldn't make any visual difference - it doesn't fire, as (not) seen in the console
[17:01:15] <cypha> if I could get some help with getting this script http://68.198.22.26:8000/test working, i'd be more than happy to buy someone a beer
[17:03:52] <slowfuse> I found it for jqPlot... {axes:{xaxis:{tickOptions:{formatString:'%d'}}}}  Thanks anyway.:)
[17:20:04] <cnnr> if i'm sending data over a POST ajax submission, and that data is coming from an input box, is there a function I can call on it to strip all the white space, and escape any &'s, etc…?
[17:23:38] <SkyFlyer> I'm doing a bind with click event.  question though is once you click, the slight link outline remains on the page.  any way to remove that outline.  it goes away if I click somewhere else on page.  its the outline that shows a link is there.  I don't want to show that?  any ideas?
[17:43:18] <cakehero> Can I get all the jQuery UI stuff in a small number of files or do I need to include ~15 files to get it (dialog, date picker, slider, etc). I'm referring to the CSS
[17:45:31] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: kill me, thanks
[17:45:51] <Dave_Stein> cakehero I'm pretty sure all the CSS stays bundled, unlike the JS
[17:46:09] <cakehero> Dave_Stein stays in separate files?
[17:46:26] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: you can choose to bundle up the JS however you want, based on dependencies
[17:47:39] <cakehero> Dave_Stein do you just always include jquery.ui.all.css when you are using a few jquery widgets?
[17:48:04] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: I don't use the CSS out of the box, i just take positinoing and put it in my css file since i have my own theme
[17:48:27] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: but now youre making me think i could be wrong if they haev a .all.css im guessing they have it broken down somewhere :)
[17:48:32] <Dave_Stein> *have a
[17:49:24] <cakehero> Dave_Stein yeah, all.css just includes the others
[17:49:38] <cakehero> Dave_Stein jquery.ui.tabs.css, jquery.ui.datepicker.css, etc
[17:49:58] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: so if you can pick out ui.tabs.css individually, what question is there?
[17:50:02] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: sorry i'm a bit fried
[17:50:04] <Dave_Stein> :)
[17:50:18] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: if you can pick out individual ones, i wouldnt put them all on same page for no reason
[17:51:33] <cakehero> Dave_Stein I am just wondering if my website has 30 pages with different jquery UI elements if I can just include them all, all the time, or if it is better to include each one as necessar
[17:51:41] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[17:51:57] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: if you have 30 pages and like 2 different plugins on each page, its best to use .all so user has to dl once and then it's cached
[17:52:41] <Dave_Stein> cakehero: but a better option would be to pick out the ones you need, roll them into a file of your own
[17:53:19] <cypha> not sure if I'm doing something wrong, I'm having this issue: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/667
[17:53:19] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #667 on jQuery-File-Upload, reported by cypha (24m, 7s ago): application.js (from the example folder) hides the selected file's path in the textbox of the file <input>

[18:42:43] <Acolyte> when I send request to my ASMX service, the Context.Response.ContentType is empty, even though I set it to "application/json" in $.ajax... anyone advise?
[18:43:05] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/D6gzs/1/ How do I make a recursive function like this?  http://javascript.about.com/library/blrecursive.htm tries to say i'm doing it right
[18:43:08] <Acolyte> And when I use Tamper tool to send same request with application/json format, it works as intended
[18:49:39] <bobholt> innociv: you want to be passing that same iterator back into the function
[18:49:43] <bobholt> here's one solution: http://jsfiddle.net/bobholt/CrS3E/
[18:51:23] <innociv> I got it.  shouldn't have had hte quotes aroudn the fucntion in setTimeout
[19:04:32] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/D6gzs/7/ Why is the .css() scale immediately making this large, rather than the transition working?  If you go into inspector and toggle the scale style on-off it transitions fine.
[19:07:38] <bluenavajo> hi all
[19:07:55] <innociv> If the style is applied so quickly it seems to act like it was there to begin with. I can't figure out a good way to add it after a delay, though
[19:08:14] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/D6gzs/8/ this just works on the last one.
[19:09:11] <Acolyte> does anyone has any idea why POSTing via $.ajax of dataType JSONP causes content type to default to application/xml?
[19:10:30] <cnnr> when developing a plugin, if I have a default option, say 'root', set to "someRandomString", and I want another default option, say, 'root_plus_some' to be set to whatever 'root' is, concatenated with another string, how would I go about doing that?
[19:10:45] <bluenavajo> I have a interval related issue. I set a divs margin-top to a calculated amount, but every time the scroll bar of the browser makes a small jump up, even though the page height does not change. Can I prevent this, because it is really annoying if you scroll down and you're jumping back up.
[19:15:41] <innociv> I got i.
[19:15:46] <innociv> it*
[19:28:18] <bluenavajo> If I use .click(function... I only can assign one event right?
[19:28:58] <bluenavajo> and multiple with bind?
[19:32:10] <warrenparsons> @bluenavajo that's right. .click() is a shortcut for .bind('click')
[19:33:46] <warrenparsons> Anyway, if you're using 1.7, you'll want to start using .on() in place of .bind() or .click() anyway as that's the new event model.
[19:40:09] <Acolyte> does anyone has any idea why POSTing via $.ajax of dataType JSONP causes content type to be empty?
[19:43:19] <bobholt> the server sets the Content-Type of the response, so it could be any number of server issues.
[19:43:50] <bobholt> the web service could be expecting a GET, it may be configured improperly...
[19:44:36] <bobholt> it shouldn't have anything to do with your $.ajax({dataType: 'jsonp'}) - that only tells jQuery what to expect back}
[19:45:35] <oojacoboo> hey guys, I am trying to call an include using jquery to refresh a div on a page based on an event
[19:45:42] <oojacoboo> any tips here?
[19:46:16] <oojacoboo> it's actually more like a php function, the include is part of the framework and variables are passed to it
[19:47:56] <ngharo> call an include?
[19:48:21] <oojacoboo> .load(myPhp())
[19:49:47] <ngharo> write a simple service to call your php function
[19:50:19] <ngharo> if(get['foo'] == 'bar') myPhp()
[19:50:37] <ngharo> then .load('/?foo=bar')
[19:50:59] <oojacoboo> mmm
[19:51:10] <oojacoboo> I think that went halfway over my head
[19:52:00] <warrenparsons> @oojacoboo Can you restate what you're trying to do?
[19:52:17] <oojacoboo> using Symfony, fyi
[19:52:40] <oojacoboo> I load in a "partial", which is basically an include that you can also pass variables to
[19:53:13] <oojacoboo> so it loads in another file, like an include.  I want to call this "php function include" on success of an ajax call
[19:53:16] <warrenparsons> Okay. And is the partial a complete PHP file, or a PHP include that needs to be parsed?
[19:53:22] <oojacoboo> to refresh that portion of the page
[19:53:37] <oojacoboo> it needs to be parsed by php
[19:53:42] <oojacoboo> it's not straight html
[19:54:14] <warrenparsons> But does it output HTML?
[19:54:33] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: yes
[19:55:06] <warrenparsons> Okay. Just to clear things up, do you get the difference between client-side and server-side? No offense.
[19:55:19] <oojacoboo> haha, yes
[19:55:21] <warrenparsons> k
[19:55:25] <warrenparsons> You never know.
[19:55:42] <oojacoboo> I'm a frontend UI guy though, so, kinda new to scripting
[19:55:49] <oojacoboo> and business guy ;)
[19:56:00] <warrenparsons> So basically you want to call the results of some PHP running on the server into a div based on a DOM event.
[19:56:04] <oojacoboo> not new to it, new to coding it :P
[19:56:13] <oojacoboo> yes, that's correct
[19:56:39] <oojacoboo> well, it's based on an ajax 200 event
[19:56:40] <warrenparsons> Okay, well the .load will get you most of the way there. What's the event you want to use as a trigger?
[19:56:41] <oojacoboo> but w/e
[19:56:53] <oojacoboo> yea, success of .ajax()
[19:56:57] <oojacoboo> I got that already
[19:57:41] <ngharo> inception!
[19:57:52] <warrenparsons> I still don't think I'm getting your situation. It sounds like what you need to do is call a URL in a .load() when some other event happens.
[19:58:21] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: yes, but I can't just call a url
[19:58:29] <oojacoboo> I have to pass it variables
[19:58:38] <warrenparsons> Can you pass them in a querystring?
[19:59:16] <oojacoboo> I don't think so
[19:59:28] <oojacoboo> <?php include_partial('leads/demosidebar', array("state" => $state, "leadCountArray" => $leadCountArray)); ?>
[19:59:40] <oojacoboo> that's what loads in the "include"
[20:00:25] <warrenparsons> Gotcha. You need to parse that partial in some containing document before you can call it via AJAX. Sorry if that's obvious.
[20:00:59] <oojacoboo> yea, but how :P
[20:01:12] <ngharo> create a page that outputs ONLY that partial
[20:01:32] <oojacoboo> tru
[20:02:19] <warrenparsons> Create a PHP file that has an HTML document. Load the partial into a div with an ID (let's call it "myID"). Then call that containing PHP doc in your .load, passing in the ID after the URL to the doc.
[20:02:42] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: yea, I think I got it, thanks
[20:03:03] <warrenparsons> $myNewContainer.load('/path/to/containing/doc.php #myID', function(){ my success callback });
[20:03:04] <oojacoboo> I was just hoping there was a less bulky way of doing it
[20:03:32] <warrenparsons> Yeah, not really unless you're serializing output as JSON or XML already.
[20:03:44] <oojacoboo> what about using an iframe technique
[20:03:47] <warrenparsons> The problem is getting the application side code parsed and ready for output.
[20:03:56] <oojacoboo> not sure exactly how you'd pull it off, but seems like it might be possible
[20:04:16] <warrenparsons> Well, you'd still need an HTML doc to load into the iframe.
[20:04:35] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:05:25] <oojacoboo> do most people just do a reload on a DOM updates, or update the DOM itself?
[20:05:25] <warrenparsons> I have to do similar stuff in JSP from time to time. It's not as ugly as it might seem.
[20:06:02] <oojacoboo> like, I'm thinking setting up portions of the DOM that are complex and likely to change a lot, it's easier to just reload that content than it would be to update the DOM with js based on an event
[20:06:40] <oojacoboo> and the reload time for most users wouldn't give a bad experience
[20:06:56] <warrenparsons> Yeah, if you're making bulk changes to a container, like a product listing in a catalog view, it often makes sense to replace the block wholesale rather than changing pieces individually (price, SKU, color, etc.).
[20:07:22] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:07:29] <oojacoboo> that's what we do in a lot of instances
[20:07:52] <oojacoboo> btw, I'm not the one that typically writes this stuff ;)
[20:08:28] <oojacoboo> ngharo: everyone starts somewhere man
[20:08:38] <oojacoboo> I'm sure I have tons of topics I could take you to school on
[20:08:49] <oojacoboo> no need for the slighting remarks ;)
[20:08:53] <warrenparsons> As an aside, using event delegation (.delegate() and .live(), or built into the new .on() event model) can save you lots of headaches when replacing blocks that have events attached.
[20:09:15] <ngharo> sorry, we get goofy in here at night
[20:09:19] <warrenparsons> Otherwise you find yourself manually reattaching events each time something updates. Sucks.
[20:09:30] <ngharo> i cant help but throw some cheap shots at php questions
[20:09:46] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: that's interesting
[20:10:08] <oojacoboo> ngharo: well, I'm not good at php either
[20:10:26] <warrenparsons> Basically you tell a parent container, could be a div, parent UL, even the document, to listen for an event, then check its target. If the target matches your desired element, you fire your callback.
[20:10:36] <oojacoboo> but try me on html/css or anything design and you won't have a chance
[20:10:59] <warrenparsons> That way it doesn't matter if the target element existed in the document at load time.
[20:10:59] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: that
[20:10:59] <oojacoboo> '
[20:11:02] <oojacoboo> that's awesome
[20:11:12] <warrenparsons> Yeah. .on() in 1.7 is your friend.
[20:11:37] <warrenparsons> .delegate() and .live() are available in earlier versions, but .on() unifies it all.
[20:11:54] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:12:17] <oojacoboo> our codebase is quite a few years old, so we're not using a lot of that
[20:12:20] <ngharo> ?on
[20:12:21] <bot-t> ngharo, .submit() - Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[20:12:34] <oojacoboo> it's really a mix of reloading and actual DOM updates based on events
[20:12:40] <warrenparsons> @ngharo it's new in the 1.7 beta.
[20:12:43] <ngharo> on() allows attaching to nonexistent elements?
[20:12:45] <oojacoboo> but it's all event based triggers
[20:12:52] <oojacoboo> forced, not listening
[20:13:02] <warrenparsons> .on() combines the functionality of .bind(), .delegate() and .live()
[20:13:22] <warrenparsons> .off() being its counterpart
[20:13:26] <ngharo> sweet
[20:13:34] <warrenparsons> Yeah, I'm already in love with it.
[20:13:41] <coldhead> aww
[20:13:50] <oojacoboo> wow, that's going to make things very easy
[20:13:50] <warrenparsons> In a platonic kind of way.
[20:13:53] <ngharo> .on('love', snuggle)
[20:14:05] <coldhead> lol
[20:15:50] <warrenparsons> Here's the full writeup on 1.7. They also fixed the .animate() issue where you lose height on an element if running/stopping it too quickly. http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/28/jquery-1-7-beta-1-released/
[20:16:24] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: how about the slideUp/slideDown issue with padding and width
[20:16:39] <warrenparsons> Doesn't look like it. Just read the bug report this evening.
[20:16:46] <oojacoboo> I've found using animate for height works better
[20:16:50] <warrenparsons> I could be wrong, though.
[20:17:17] <warrenparsons> I'm not fond of slideUp/Down just because of the animation effect with contained text.
[20:17:29] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:17:44] <oojacoboo> .animation with height works better
[20:17:45] <warrenparsons> I usually fade or hide the text and then slideUp in a callback.
[20:17:49] <oojacoboo> uor using top/bottom
[20:18:00] <warrenparsons> And vice-versa.
[20:18:50] <oojacoboo> height works well, display: none; height: 0; then animate block and height 100%
[20:19:28] <oojacoboo> or visibility if you will have DOM flickering issues
[20:21:15] <warrenparsons> I was a little sad when I realized jQuery UI had a built in "slide" effect for exposing elements after I'd built one myself on my last project. Serves me for not looking around before I code.
[20:22:02] <oojacoboo> I can't bring myself to use jQuery UI
[20:22:20] <oojacoboo> only for complex UI elements like calendar selects
[20:22:42] <warrenparsons> I wouldn't include UI only for "slide."
[20:22:43] <oojacoboo> I just don't like what it does with the html and css
[20:23:01] <oojacoboo> editing anything in jQuery UI is a nightmare
[20:23:19] <warrenparsons> Not if you're careful. You can use the effects module without dealing with all the theming.
[20:23:20] <oojacoboo> all of it's dependent classes and ids… yuck
[20:23:23] <oojacoboo> I understand the need, but still
[20:23:47] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: I guess I am talking about the theme elements
[20:23:52] <oojacoboo> is slide() part of UI?
[20:24:08] <warrenparsons> Yeah, the theming is what turns me off about it. Never a good fit for our projects.
[20:24:19] <warrenparsons> http://jqueryui.com/docs/effect/
[20:24:23] <oojacoboo> we use the calendar
[20:24:25] <oojacoboo> that's about it
[20:24:29] <warrenparsons> The effects module is in UI.
[20:24:50] <ngharo> I love the theming because we don't have a real designer at work
[20:25:01] <ngharo> just a bunch of code monkies.  i use the shit out of ui classes
[20:25:04] <oojacoboo> :/
[20:25:18] <warrenparsons> @ngharo I can totally see that. If I was starting from the theme and working outward it would be great. But that's not how our workflow runs.
[20:25:41] <ngharo> word
[20:25:44] <oojacoboo> we do design/UI down
[20:26:11] <oojacoboo> design -> markup -> js/php
[20:26:32] <WalkWurst> @warrenparsons I don't see the .on() or .off() in the JQuery API docs, where would that be?
[20:26:36] <warrenparsons> Yeah, absolutely not dissing the theming model of UI and Mobile. Just doesn't fit well with our workflow so far.
[20:27:07] <warrenparsons> @WalkWurst It's in the 1.7 beta. Documented here - http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/28/jquery-1-7-beta-1-released/
[20:27:43] <WalkWurst> slick slick, tyvm!
[20:28:19] <warrenparsons> My current project has at least a month before launch, and 1.7 will almost certainly be final before then. So I'm using the heck out of it.
[20:29:00] <warrenparsons> BRB gotta take the puppy out.
[20:29:03] <WalkWurst> I'm trying to get a handle on the event binding using proxy()
[20:34:05] <warrenparsons> Yeah, there was a presentation on .proxy() at the conference this weekend. Still over my head, sad to say.
[20:35:09] <WalkWurst> Yeah, I was baffled by it too, but that's one reason why I'm messing with it now.
[20:35:22] <warrenparsons> Were you in Boston?
[20:35:25] <WalkWurst> yeah
[20:35:28] <warrenparsons> Sweet.
[20:35:57] <WalkWurst> was just checking out Ben Nadel's old post about using proxy(), got it working. http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2001-Using-jQuery-s-Proxy-Method-In-Event-Binding-And-Unbinding.htm
[20:36:11] <warrenparsons> I recorded the Dramatic Readings of jQuery Bugs breakout session. Here's the link if you didn't see it - http://www.youtube.com/user/sludge01?feature=mhee#p/c/F11BE01786ABB78F
[20:36:18] <warrenparsons> Comedy gold.
[20:36:34] <WalkWurst> my test version that is. pretty slick, now I have to figure out how to do it with .on() and .off()
[20:37:20] <WalkWurst> I'll check that vid out
[20:37:32] <warrenparsons> There's a whole set of them there.
[20:39:40] <WalkWurst> oh man, I didn't attend any of the breakout sessions
[20:39:50] <warrenparsons> That was the only one I went to. So glad I did.
[20:40:17] <warrenparsons> It was a much-needed break from the mental overload of the rest of the weekend.
[20:40:35] <WalkWurst> oh man, those are hilarious
[20:41:14] <warrenparsons> Yeah, the camera was shaking a lot because I was laughing so damn hard.
[20:41:27] <WalkWurst> lol, I bet
[20:44:14] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: http://jsfiddle.net/5pDDS/
[20:44:20] <oojacoboo> any ideas what I am screwing up here?
[20:45:13] <warrenparsons> Well, first thing I see is this will get you into trouble if your doc structure ever changes slightly - $(this).parent().parent().parent();
[20:46:04] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: yea, I didn't type that
[20:46:07] <oojacoboo> I noticed the same
[20:46:14] <warrenparsons> k
[20:47:41] <warrenparsons> Still looking.
[20:48:25] <warrenparsons> It's hard to say without it actually talking to the data. But nothing's showing up in JS Lint.
[20:48:38] <oojacoboo> mmm
[20:48:43] <warrenparsons> Of course, the lack of data may also be why it's borking on jsfiddle
[20:49:54] <warrenparsons> You've also got it wrapped in a closure, but you're not executing the closure to attach any of the event handlers.
[20:50:11] <oojacoboo> not following
[20:50:37] <warrenparsons> Oh, nevermind. Sleepy brain didn't see the leading $ at the beginning.
[20:51:10] <warrenparsons> Which part is giving you trouble? There's a lot going on here.
[20:51:29] <oojacoboo> I think that's what it was
[20:51:40] <oojacoboo> wait
[20:51:49] <oojacoboo> well, the load() isn't working
[20:52:17] <warrenparsons> And you're running it where it can talk to the actual data, unlike on jsfiddle, right? ;)
[20:52:33] <oojacoboo> right, it's at the foot of the file actually
[20:52:37] <warrenparsons> k
[20:52:47] <oojacoboo> nasty, but this is just our internal CP
[20:53:06] <warrenparsons> Well, I'm not seeing a definition for your baseurl var. Is that elsewhere in the file?
[20:53:30] <oojacoboo> mmm, that's in our other scripts, I think that's part of the utilities.js
[20:53:32] <oojacoboo> checking
[20:54:09] <warrenparsons> you could put a console.log('baseurl: ', baseurl); earlier to see if it's getting a value.
[20:54:13] <oojacoboo> warrenparsons: I think that's it
[20:54:25] <oojacoboo> those aren't defined in this app yet :/
[20:54:28] <warrenparsons> LOL
[20:54:33] <warrenparsons> That would keep it from working.
[20:54:39] <oojacoboo> yea it would
[20:54:48] <warrenparsons> If you know the actual URL you could hard code it in for testing.
[20:55:02] <oojacoboo> yea, gonna just do it right :P
[20:55:20] <oojacoboo> I'm a sucker for protocol
[20:55:26] <warrenparsons> Anyway, my girlfriend's home so I'm gonna sign off. This was fun, so I'll probably make it a regular thing.
[20:55:36] <oojacoboo> If I make and try to enforce, I better comply, right?
[20:55:43] <warrenparsons> LOL Yep
[20:55:46] <oojacoboo> enjoy, take care
[20:55:51] <warrenparsons> 'night folks.
[20:55:54] <coldhead> anytime, warrenparsons !
[20:56:06] <coldhead> who the fuck was that guy?
[20:56:19] <oojacoboo> warren parsons
[20:56:23] <oojacoboo> duh
[20:57:24] <coldhead> oh right
[20:57:37] <coldhead> thanks ooja cob oo
[20:57:56] <oojacoboo> it's jacob
[20:57:59] <coldhead> or is it ooja cobo o?
[20:58:08] <coldhead> or ooja co boo?
[20:58:10] <oojacoboo> oo jacob oo
[20:58:14] <coldhead> o_o
[20:58:18] <coldhead> oic
[20:58:33] <coldhead> are the "o"s bales of hay?
[20:58:40] <coldhead> they're very handsome
[20:58:44] <oojacoboo> they are from the old AOL days
[20:58:50] <coldhead> oh i heard of them
[20:58:51] <oojacoboo> Oo Jacob oO was how it started
[20:59:23] <oojacoboo> now, practically everyone I know uses it as a real life nickname
[20:59:26] <oojacoboo> so it's kinda stuck
[21:00:32] <coldhead> well it could be worse
[21:00:35] <coldhead> much much worse
[21:00:41] <coldhead> look at temp01
[21:00:51] <oojacoboo> heh
[21:14:56] <oojacoboo> if you need to get a var that is part of a request, what's the best way to go about this?
[21:15:22] <oojacoboo> would you just store the var in an html attr and pull that val() or would you add some xml to the page, a hidden input or what?
[21:15:30] <oojacoboo> what's the most preferred method of doing this?
[21:16:20] <oojacoboo> s/'of doing this'/'for handling this'
[21:18:21] <coldhead> oojacoboo: depends on the circumstance, but a popular modern way is to store and retrieve it via data()
[21:18:23] <coldhead> ?data
[21:18:23] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[21:18:34] <coldhead> cleaner than attributes
[21:18:45] <oojacoboo> mmm
[21:19:06] <oojacoboo> coldhead: the variables would need to be set by php and picked up by js
[21:19:18] <oojacoboo> not set by js for later use
[21:19:51] <coldhead> yeah, data does that
[21:20:12] <oojacoboo> how does data do that?
[21:20:16] <coldhead> <thingy data-pants="7777"> --> $('thingy').data('pants')
[21:20:21] <oojacoboo> yea… ok
[21:20:25] <oojacoboo> that's an html attr ;)
[21:20:35] <coldhead> no it isn't
[21:20:38] <coldhead> well it isn't JUST
[21:20:40] <oojacoboo> oh, but it is
[21:20:47] <coldhead> it's also HTML5, bro
[21:20:49] <coldhead> CAN YOU FEEL ME
[21:20:53] <oojacoboo> yea yea ;)
[21:20:55] <oojacoboo> still an attr
[21:20:58] <coldhead> in a way that some-custom-attr="lol" isn't
[21:21:02] <oojacoboo> that's what I thoguth you were gonna say though
[21:21:05] <oojacoboo> yea
[21:21:37] <oojacoboo> technically anything <inside the="element" is="an-attribute">
[21:22:01] <oojacoboo> but yea, that's html5 and has a spec purpose
[21:22:06] <oojacoboo> that's on the <body> right
[21:22:45] <oojacoboo> well, I guess technically it doesn't matter where you put it
[21:30:14] <gnarf> coldhead: http://www.youtube.com/user/sludge01
[21:30:31] <coldhead> oh i am all over that already gnarf
[21:30:40] <gnarf> coldhead: :)
[21:32:26] <Spadeski> how to slide left to right and show dom , go....
[21:32:58] <AphelionZ> Hello all - working with jquery templates. What am I doing wrong here? http://pastie.org/2635792
[21:33:25] <joshkehn> Quick question: What is the simplest drag and drop supported file uploader?
[21:33:32] <mav_> Hi guys I hav question regarding creation of html tables dynamically on ajax calls
[21:34:14] <mav_> I am new to this IRC Chat. Can anyone tell how can I get my questions answered
[21:35:05] <coldhead> a good step is to ask the damn question
[21:35:21] <coldhead> also link to the code you have so far
[21:35:31] <mav_> ok
[21:35:34] <coldhead> and for bonus points link to/create a working demo
[21:35:40] <coldhead> on jsfiddle
[21:39:12] <harpal> I am trying to use jquery-ui dialog box. My zend framework writes javascript for that, Its $("#confirm").dialog({"modal":true,"buttons":{"Cancel":"function() {$( this ).dialog( \"close\" );}"}});
[21:39:28] <harpal> But when I load page it says String contains an invalid character" code: "5
[21:41:40] <mav_> Hi guys I am new to jQuery. Please look at the code in the link http://jsfiddle.net/ykPXZ/ . I hav to request 2 web services, from one i ll get some attribute val and from other I ll get details for that attribute value. After getting the data I hav to populate it in table
[21:42:21] <mav_> So I have done something as shown in the link. Please tell me is this the best approach to do it. My problem is I am not able to get the data
[21:43:00] <mav_> It is not getting displayed as HTMl on the page, instead it gets deleted somehow. Please help.
[21:45:21] <coldhead> mav_: this code looks okay
[21:45:51] <coldhead> but is the URL you're getting the data from on the same site as the page you're running this script on?
[21:46:02] <coldhead> are they on the same domain?
[21:46:23] <mav_> yeah they are on same domain and in an internal network
[21:46:39] <coldhead> that should work
[21:46:49] <coldhead> and when you run it in firebug or chrome web inspector
[21:46:53] <mav_> I am able to get the data but not able to display it with this code and I am unable to figure it out
[21:46:56] <coldhead> can you see the data coming back in the network tab?
[21:47:07] <coldhead> oh okay
[21:47:26] <mav_> yes..I can see the data coming..earlier there was a Same Origin issue but it was resolved
[21:47:34] <e1ch1> is it possible to break hyperlink behavior with unbind?
[21:48:36] <coldhead> mav_: part of the problem could be that you are firing off a lot of getJSON calls
[21:48:40] <mav_> I have created a div <div id="tableData" class="tableData"></div>	 and I am appending data to it...but it is not getting displayed in the html page
[21:48:42] <coldhead> and the will not necessarily return in order
[21:49:13] <e1ch1> i just realized that hyperlinks no longer work after doing bind/unbind for click event on body
[21:49:33] <coldhead> e1ch1: that should not be possible
[21:49:33] <ExpFist> Does anyone know in canvas a good accurate way to get the height of text?
[21:49:54] <ExpFist> I read rotating a W then getting the width but that adds a ton of overhead if i need to clear the canvas just to do that for each frame
[21:49:55] <e1ch1> it's strange then
[21:50:08] <mav_> okay. Can this be an issue. I have tried populating data using static json file earlier and the same code was working
[21:50:36] <mav_> Please suggest any other approach
[21:50:48] <coldhead> mav_: i would try making the getJSON calls recursive
[21:51:04] <coldhead> so the success handler for each makes the next getJSON call
[21:51:09] <coldhead> until they're all done
[21:51:16] <coldhead> that will guaratnee that they run in order
[21:51:48] <coldhead> otherwise i would try push()ing each new table entry into an array
[21:51:55] <coldhead> and joining them all together after
[21:52:03] <coldhead> instead of concatenating them as you go
[21:52:21] <FNTom> coldhead: Why not keep an open connection to the server and the server pushes the information?
[21:52:49] <mav_> ok. Can you tell me how can I make recursive calls on getJSON success function?
[21:52:57] <coldhead> FNTom: i don't know how to do that :)
[21:53:04] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:53:26] <FNTom> Oh, I guess it was directed at mav_ :P
[21:53:28] <FNTom> My bad
[21:53:31] <mav_> I can try pushing each new entry in a table
[21:54:14] <mav_> @FNTOM how to do that. Even I am new to jQuery.
[21:54:37] <gskudlarick> ok.
[21:55:25] <SlexAxton> you guys new to jQuery too?
[21:57:52] <coldhead> mav_: this has syntax errors but it shows the general idea: http://jsfiddle.net/ykPXZ/1/
[21:58:24] <coldhead> oh well FUCK YOU THEN, mav_
[21:58:35] <coldhead> bot-t: tell mav_ I KILLEE
[21:58:35] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:58:41] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[21:58:41] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[21:59:07] <coldhead> bot-t: do you believe that a human and a bot could ever find love together?
[21:59:07] <bot-t> coldhead, Very doubtful.
[21:59:20] <coldhead> bot-t: i appreciate your honesty
[21:59:21] <bot-t> coldhead, Smashing jQuery By Jake Rutter - http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2127-Smashing-jQuery-By-Jake-Rutter.htm
[21:59:58] <coldhead> bot-t: you like bennadel too?
[21:59:58] <bot-t> coldhead, Reply hazy, try again.
[22:00:02] <coldhead> bot-t: you like bennadel too?
[22:00:02] <bot-t> coldhead, As I see it, yes.
[22:02:18] <harpal> $("#confirm").dialog({"modal":true,"buttons":{"Cancel":function() {$( this ).dialog( "close" );}}});  works fine but $("#confirm").dialog({"modal":true,"buttons":{"Cancel":"function() {$( this ).dialog( \"close\" );}"}}); doesnt
[22:03:10] <harpal> So is that mean, I cant pass quoted parameters to option in jQuery, as its giving error  String contains an invalid character" code: "5
[22:03:37] <ddoom> anyone know how to make an entire tabl row respond to click, unless they click on an input field within the row?
[22:03:56] <coldhead> harpal: you really don't want to pass functions as strings anyway
[22:04:14] <coldhead> anymore than you would date a strand of marilyn monroe's DNA
[22:04:17] <coldhead> it's not the same thing!
[22:05:23] <harpal> coldhead: My PHP Framework, uses that. So I am confirming that.
[22:05:42] <harpal> I think I have to write manually script ;)
[22:06:05] <coldhead> good luck harpal !
[22:07:09] <garbagegod> hey guys, i have an ajax question
[22:08:27] <garbagegod> please forgive my ignorance on the subject... but... I have this: http://pastebin.com/fD7Z907d and i want to add another post thing
[22:09:28] <garbagegod> kinda like this: http://pastebin.com/cpm3jJHQ (notice line 7)
[22:09:39] <garbagegod> i know im doing it wrong, but whats the right way?
[22:09:55] <ddoom> anyone? click on table row and if you click on an input field ignore the whole row click
[22:10:29] <coldhead> ddoom: in the click handler, test if $(event.target).is('input')
[22:10:34] <coldhead> if so, return false
[22:10:53] <coldhead> garbagegod: you really don't need to apologise for this
[22:11:22] <garbagegod> I will probably have to in a minute :P
[22:12:29] <coldhead> garbagegod: http://pastebin.com/g9xT1t0y
[22:12:31] <garbagegod> so what is the right way, anyhow? I've tried it several different ways but i was just firing blindly.
[22:12:49] <garbagegod> oh cool, thanks coldhead! :3
[22:12:52] <coldhead> you just give jQuery an object with your data and it wraps it up nice for you :)
[22:13:07] <garbagegod> cool :)
[22:13:12] <coldhead> good luck!
[22:13:32] <garbagegod> thanks again, i really appreciate it..
[22:13:50] <coldhead> my pleasure
[22:16:01] <ddoom> coldhead: thanks buddy, worked a treat
[22:16:47] <coldhead> yay!
[22:17:43] <harpal> coldhead: Hey, Got it working... :D
[22:18:21] <coldhead> good work harpal!
[22:18:31] <coldhead> i'm so proud of you all
[22:18:40] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[22:22:17] <phat_code^> anyone know a good tutorial on how to send the order of portlets and sortables back to a database. here is my test page http://belphegor.us/test/
[22:26:18] <garbagegod> coldhead: that didnt quite work, im definitely not experienced enough with jQuery to go making assumptions, but could i rewrite what you did using getElementById function as opposed to just .val()?
[22:26:20] <e1ch1> coldhead: seems like i managed to reproduce problem on jsfiddle
[22:26:21] <e1ch1> http://jsfiddle.net/3CtrT/
[22:26:27] <garbagegod> i dont know why but im hoping that will work
[22:27:51] <cypha> could someone possibly help me with this? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/667
[22:27:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #667 on jQuery-File-Upload, reported by cypha (4h, 58m ago): "basic" script hides the selected file's path in the textbox of the file <input>
[22:33:14] <Z3R0> anyone know how to stop jquery from moving back to top on changing of a div content that is located lower than the browser window? (aka you have to scroll to see the div... then you modify the div based on something like a select box change...) I have e.preventDefault() and return false; and yet, it keeps going back to the top of the screen
[22:33:33] <e1ch1> problem resides in line $("body").unbind("click", context_menu_close_handler).bind("click", context_menu_close_handler);
[22:34:48] <e1ch1> probably i'm doing it wrong :)
[22:35:03] <Jakey> dam right you are
[22:44:38] <coldhead> e1ch1: this is way out of my depth i'm sorry
[22:45:00] <coldhead> best bet is to ask an official jQuery UI team person like ajpiano when he's around
[22:45:13] <coldhead> i think he's at a planetarium or something AT
[22:45:15] <coldhead> M
[22:47:31] <e1ch1> i'll poke around existing plugins for now to see how they do things
[22:47:41] <coldhead> wise move
[22:50:07] <AphelionZ> Is anybody good with jquery templates? Can anybody tell me why http://pastie.org/2635792 isn't working? The variables in my template arent rendering as anything, yet the template still renders twice.
[22:51:44] <coldhead> AphelionZ: can you make a working demo on jsfiddle from that?
[22:52:09] <coldhead> you can hotlink the tmpl lib in the Add Resources section at left
[22:54:24] <Z3R0> wow... that's kinda neato lol
[22:54:58] <Z3R0> anyone got any ideas on my above question @ 00:30 CST lol
[22:55:40] <snover> Z3R0: “lol” is not a “.”
[22:56:05] <Z3R0> .
[22:56:07] <coldhead> i couldn't understand your question, Z3R0
[22:56:16] <coldhead> i'm new to jQuery
[22:56:20] <coldhead> first day in fact
[22:57:23] <Z3R0> basically I have a select box... that has a few items in it... and on change, it changes the contents of a div (easy enough) the div is located further down than a normal screen can see, so you must scroll down to see the div and the select box... once I select a new item in the select box, the div changes... however it keeps sending the user back to the top of the page, and not staying fixated on the select box and div
[22:57:34] <Jakey> ....... coldhead
[22:57:37] <Jakey> first day...
[22:57:39] <Jakey> really
[22:57:46] <Jakey> i've seen you here for like ages
[22:57:52] <Z3R0> ya sorry CH, I already know that's a lie, i've been here many a times lol
[22:57:56] <snover> that was a different coldhead, jakey
[22:58:27] <Jakey> snover how knows
[22:58:44] <snover> coldhead: ...............................................................................
[22:59:31] <coldhead> ...............................................................................
[22:59:41] <Jakey> ............
[22:59:44] <snover> .....................................................................................,..........................
[22:59:52] <Jakey> i am even more confuse
[22:59:54] <ruby_on_tails> when i open a page in my browser it shows that the page loads up 2 seconds, when i fetch it via an ajax request chrome console says it takes 6 seconds to load it
[23:00:03] <ruby_on_tails> what can be the reason for this differnce ?
[23:00:48] <coldhead> ruby_on_tails: your router is probably configured to give AJAX packets a lower priority
[23:00:59] <coldhead> possibly*
[23:01:25] <ruby_on_tails> it shows 2 seconds latency also
[23:01:28] <Jakey> why does ChanServ keeps doing that
[23:01:35] <coldhead> oh yes, network latency
[23:01:40] <coldhead> i've heard of that
[23:01:51] <coldhead> ruby_on_tails: can you just add a spinner?
[23:01:54] <coldhead> users like spinners
[23:02:07] <coldhead> oooh... spinner... spinning spinning spinning...
[23:02:10] <coldhead> that's what they say
[23:02:14] <coldhead> lol
[23:02:41] <coldhead> ChanServ: what's going on?
[23:02:43] <ruby_on_tails> already got a spinner but its a very data entry intensive app and 6 seconds is too much
[23:03:37] <coldhead> are you sure you're accessing the same data, ruby_on_tails?
[23:03:43] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: its the same page
[23:03:45] <coldhead> there's not a debug param or something?
[23:03:50] <coldhead> go-slow=true ?
[23:03:58] <ruby_on_tails> nope
[23:04:02] <coldhead> GUH
[23:04:41] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:04:49] <ruby_on_tails> nvm, will leave this as it is
[23:05:20] <coldhead> i approve
[23:05:42] <Z3R0> hmmmm
[23:05:48] <Z3R0> looks like I'm going to have to dig further in...
[23:05:57] <Z3R0> according to my fiddle test, it works as I want it to
[23:06:08] <Z3R0> so something else is causing it to move back to top
[23:06:28] <seeg> hello
[23:06:40] <seeg> i have an image and I change dynamically its src
[23:07:10] <seeg> i want to do some action when this src is changed, is this bound to the "load" event of the image?
[23:07:23] <seeg> i do live("load", function() { ... }) and nothing seems to happen
[23:07:33] <coldhead> i don't think that works reliably, seeg
[23:07:40] <coldhead> not across browsers
[23:07:45] <Z3R0> how would you know coldhead? lol first day
[23:07:59] <coldhead> you probably need to trigger a custom event whenever you change the src
[23:08:25] <seeg> ok then...
[23:08:28] <coldhead> $('img').attr('src', 'somenewthing').trigger('srcchange')
[23:08:31] <seeg> thank you
[23:08:40] <coldhead> seeg: my friend, you are welcome
[23:09:10] <waseem_> I want to have a presentation like effect with a <li>s in a <ul>. For this purpose I am doing $('li').each (function () { $(this).fadeIn().delay(3000).fadeOut(); });. I want to fadeIn a single li let it be on the page for a while and then fadeOut. After this I have to continue doing same with other ones. The problem is that all the <li>s are fadedIn, delayed and fadedOut at the same time. Any suggestion how should I do it?
[23:09:53] <coldhead> waseem_: chain the callbacks in something like this http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[23:10:14] <waseem_> coldhead: I am on 1.5
[23:10:24] <waseem_> coldhead: I hope version is not a problem.
[23:10:47] <coldhead> oh no, that should be fine
[23:11:00] <coldhead> it's a classic technique
[23:12:13] <waseem_> coldhead: Thanks looking. BTW this Paul Irish seems to be a jQuery/Javascript super Ninja Samurai. Since I started going deeper in jQuery his name pops up everywhere. :D
[23:12:52] <Umren> can samurai be a ninja?
[23:13:06] <coldhead> paul irish can
[23:13:23] <Umren> :3
[23:14:10] <seeg> coldhead, another question: with the trigger i want to change image's width but apparently calling it right after setting src does not work correctly
[23:15:29] <coldhead> seeg: because it isn't loaded yet
[23:15:36] <e1ch1> hmm, problem solved
[23:15:51] <seeg> hm, guess turning to Image() would solve the problem...
[23:16:13] <coldhead> seeg: yeah, i was just about to suggest that
[23:16:28] <coldhead> that object also has a .loaded attribute (or something like that)
[23:16:32] <coldhead> which you can test
[23:17:43] <coldhead> oh look, img.onload
[23:17:48] <coldhead> guess that will fix everythng
[23:26:49] <waseem_> coldhead: Thanks that is working superb! I just need to change it a little bit more according to my needs.
[23:28:13] <coldhead> excellent
[23:31:03] <DThought> good morning everyone
[23:32:46] <coldhead> good morning DThought
[23:37:11] <DThought> i assume the preffered way to acommplish dragable elements in a page is jquery-ui "draggable()"? i implemented it myself so far, but ecountered an problem when my dragable - hovering element contains an <svg> image (firefox wants to drag the image away then)
