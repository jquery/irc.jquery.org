[00:48:59] <P0rk> KingMe, what's the question?
[00:49:35] <KingMe> p0rk I need a event to capture when the swipe is over
[00:50:10] <KingMe> http://jsbin.com/kojaqoyuxo/1/edit?js,output
[01:51:10] <P0rk> Hey all
[01:56:18] <KingMe> Hey p0rk do you know the solution? http://jsbin.com/kojaqoyuxo/1/edit?js,output
[02:05:08] <P0rk> seems to work for mouse
[02:07:53] <bl4ckdu5t> Hi P0rk
[02:09:58] <P0rk> Hi
[02:12:51] <bl4ckdu5t> sleepless night
[02:32:22] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/urx73vz0/7/
[02:32:26] <P0rk> KingMe
[02:34:57] <KingMe> p0rk it should remove 1 when I swipe and 1 when I remove my finger/mouse off the screen
[02:36:07] <P0rk> so, when you swipe, it removes and then which one does it remove when you remove your finger?
[02:37:26] <P0rk> KingMe, I am not sure what you are trying to accommplish
[02:38:10] <KingMe> I didnt want to remove a specific one its just in general I want it to remove
[02:38:21] <KingMe> http://jsbin.com/kojaqoyuxo/1/edit?js,output
[02:39:03] <KingMe> when you swipe it removes one and when you release your mouse/finger I want another one to be removed
[02:41:41] <KingMe> jQuery has "touchend mouseup" event when the mouse is released or finger is off the screen but swipe doesnt so I want the same effect
[02:44:59] <P0rk> so if you have jquery loaded and it does what you want, why not use it?
[02:46:03] <KingMe> no it doesnt work for swipe
[02:46:10] <P0rk> then dont' use swi[pe
[02:46:23] <gtristan> what is the correct way to test if a node is visible in jquery ?
[02:46:36] <P0rk> why use swipe if it's not going to do what you want and another method does?
[02:46:55] <KingMe> the other method is mouse click... I need swipe
[02:46:56] <gtristan> i.e. whether $(node).hide() or show was called on it (which as I understand has some different effects depending on the node)
[02:46:56] <P0rk> $("#node").is(":visible"); ?
[02:47:35] <P0rk> there is the equivalent if you look at the fiddle I posted. Works great on android using swipe
[02:48:04] <P0rk> they virtualized the finger events to act like mouse events
[02:49:03] <P0rk> gtristan: what are you trying to accomplish?
[02:50:56] <gtristan> P0rk, I'm writing some variation of a sortable container with drag and drop features... while a drag is active, I know that I have hidden the drag source with $(node).hide(), however I do not depend on how that item was originally configured
[02:51:16] <gtristan> so I just want to have a reliable way to determine 'Did I hide this with jquery .hide() ?'
[02:52:07] <gtristan> i'm not saying that .is(":visible") is incorrect, that's the first SO answer which pops up too
[02:52:12] <gtristan> just trying to make sure :)
[02:52:40] <gtristan> the docs say that hiding the element stores the previous display state and that showing it restores it to what it was
[02:52:54] <P0rk> show and hide are ugly
[02:52:59] <P0rk> try $.toggle
[02:53:20] <P0rk> or better yet use css and add a class
[02:53:43] <gtristan> why toggle ?
[02:53:50] <P0rk> if it's hidden, add the hidden class (with CSS transitions to hide it), if your remove the hidden class it shows element
[02:53:56] <gtristan> that's certainly more ugly, as it's not explicit ;-)
[02:54:09] <P0rk> you do what you want.
[02:54:30] <P0rk> I wont argue with you. You seem to be the expert here.
[02:54:33] <gtristan> adding a CSS class may be better though, that I concede
[02:54:53] <KingMe> p0rk try this http://jsbin.com/kojaqoyuxo/1/edit?js,output
[02:55:06] <KingMe> When you click it removes 2
[02:56:51] <P0rk> jsbin sucks for swipe events
[02:57:16] <P0rk> so then what's the problem?
[02:59:49] <KingMe> I need a alternative for 'touchend mouseup' that can be used for swipe
[03:00:00] <P0rk> why
[03:01:03] <granden> Hi, I got a bit of trouble to do a .change() on a dropdown with a class colorselect I think it is because I got three dropdowns (its 3 products each with its own dropdown) I wanna watch the color change
[03:01:27] <granden> but how would I do it? because $('.colorselect').change(function(){}); did not cut it
[03:03:28] <granden> Maybe I spooke to soon.
[03:03:46] <P0rk> granden, your best bet is to isolate the code that is giving you a problem and paste it into jsfiddle.net then give us the link to it once you duplicate the issue in a smaller test case
[03:17:39] <KingMe> wow found the bug it is stopPropagation thats the worst method in the world! never use that!!
[03:18:25] <KingMe> We must all all deprecate stopPropagation asap! okay
[03:41:01] <gtristan> KingMe, it looks correct to me in my jquery.js, basically event.stopPropagation() where it exists and set cancelBubble for old and crusty IE
[03:41:27] <gtristan> KingMe, what's the bug... were you expecting it to do something other than prevent bubbling ?
[04:04:19] <KingMe> Well the bug is when I use this I get a weird thing saying "loading" under my canvas
[04:04:20] <KingMe>   <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script>
[04:47:51] <keksike> my ajax call here isnt working properly, in node I cant use req.params.time or req.params.limit properly https://gist.github.com/Keksike/b6d34270fbeec5d61c5a
[04:47:54] <keksike> what did I do wrong
[04:56:05] <granden> Is there any nice plugin for jquery that can handle options for a product or such. I have an array that looks something like this, productspecs[color][size]=quantity; so I got for example productspecs["red"]["L"] = 1; productspecs["red"]["S"] = 1; productspecs["green"]["S"]; and a lot more ofcourse then I want two group of butotns and have them relate so if I choose green in one button group then the size-button gorup 
[04:56:49] <granden> And this might be extended to more options might be like productspecs["option1"]["option2"]["option3"]["option4"] = 1;
[05:36:17] <kqr> what do you call the jquery... objects? the things which you can traverse
[05:54:50] <decx> jquery object
[05:59:43] <kqr> okay
[06:16:36] <arthurvr> kqr: what do you mean with jquery objects? instances of jQuery.fn? Such as $( ‚Äùp‚Äù )?
[06:18:29] <kqr> yeah
[06:19:12] <kqr> in this particular case, I was documenting a function that either returned $('#foobar') or $([])
[06:19:23] <kqr> but I didn't know what to call the return value
[06:19:34] <kqr> if it was a jquery iterator or a jquery object or something else
[06:20:33] <arthurvr> don‚Äôt mean if I understand you well, but we don‚Äôt really know ourselfs: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/541
[06:20:45] <arthurvr> * don‚Äôt know
[06:22:21] <kqr> ah
[06:22:33] <kqr> yeah the last part of that issue seems to deal with the same problem as I
[06:22:42] <arthurvr> kqr: we use many names but none is consistent
[06:22:47] <arthurvr> ‚Äùinstances of jQuery‚Äù
[06:22:51] <arthurvr> ‚ÄùjQuery collections‚Äù
[06:22:53] <arthurvr> and more
[06:23:02] <kqr> yeah
[06:23:31] <kqr> I settled for "jQuery iterator" because my workplace is a python shop so they'll be familiar with that terminology
[06:23:47] <arthurvr> however there are clear names for the differences between ‚Äù$.method‚Äù and ‚Äù$().method‚Äù
[06:24:14] <arthurvr> iterator I don‚Äôt see used that much tho
[06:24:20] <arthurvr> but feel free :)
[06:28:52] <KingMe> Can anyone help me make the 2nd code block the same as the 1st? http://pastebin.com/uL0zjUJc
[06:30:07] <arthurvr> KingMe: You‚Äôll just have to define jQuery.fn.swipe
[06:30:57] <arthurvr> KingMe: Inside to the same stuff, but using the parameters ;)
[06:31:08] <arthurvr> Or do I understand you wrong?
[06:31:10] <xinming> Anyone here knows in semantic-ui, How do we show 2 modal simutaneously?
[06:32:29] <KingMe> arthurvr I want to do $("#canvas").swipe('swipeLeft', function(e) {...} for the 2nd code but I dont know how as the format is weird
[07:05:41] <KingMe> Can anyone help me with jQuery? http://pastebin.com/my6Bqvnx
[07:10:15] <gtristan> KingMe, you are clearly not doing what the example your paste refers to is doing
[07:10:56] <gtristan> KingMe, calling $(pony).swipe (...) takes an object as a parameter, not a string + function
[07:11:08] <KingMe> gtristan I know but if I put the function inside the function it wont work because the scope
[07:11:20] <KingMe> so I need it more like the 1st one
[07:12:03] <gtristan> KingMe, that's not the part which is messed up
[07:12:14] <abailarri> Hello. I have a unix timestap integer and I want to convert to date like this: day/month - Hours:minutes
[07:12:16] <abailarri> What can I do?
[07:12:38] <jb0t> moment.js
[07:12:49] <KingMe> gtristan what do you mean? can you show me on pastebin?
[07:13:01] <gtristan> KingMe, $(pony).swipe ( { swipeLeft: function () { ... your callback } })
[07:13:28] <gtristan> KingMe, not $(pony).swipe ('swipeLeft', function () { ... the callback ...});
[07:13:46] <KingMe> I need   $("#canvas").on('touchstart mousedown',function(e){..}
[07:13:52] <gtristan> at least it seems clear from the example URL you refer to, that .swipe() takes a configuration object
[07:14:21] <KingMe> I cant use $(pony).swipe ( { swipeLeft: function () { ... your callback } }) because of the scope
[07:15:21] <gtristan> I dont get it then... the scope problem I thought you were referring to was the IIFE from the example you refer to
[07:15:27] <gtristan> which is not needed really
[07:16:07] <KingMe> my paste bin shows how I need it set up. I seen the example and that way wont work so I wonder how I can change it into the code in the pastebin
[07:16:14] <gtristan> KingMe, and I don't believe you have a scope problem either, your 'player' and other vars are just as much in scope if you call the function properly
[07:16:57] <gtristan> you can't decide how .swipe() recognizes it's arguments... it takes an object with some members that are functions, so thats what you must give it
[07:17:06] <KingMe> $(pony).swipe ( { swipeLeft: function () { ... your callback } }) thats 2 {{}} the pastebin is just 1 {}
[07:17:29] <gtristan> jquery .on() takes a string defining event names and a function to call, so that's what you would give .on()
[07:18:15] <gtristan> KindOne, first, a curly brace does not define scope, second, even if it were so, you would still have access to the outer scope from a dually nested inner scope
[07:19:00] <KingMe> it is not accessed the same
[07:19:06] <KingMe> or can be used the same
[07:20:26] <gtristan> .swipe ( { swipeLeft: function () { ..code has access...} }) to the same variables .on ('eventname', function () { ... as this function... })
[07:21:08] <gtristan> of course the magic 'this' may differ
[07:21:50] <KingMe> http://pastebin.com/uL0zjUJc this is if I follow the example.. and it doesnt work so I need to change it
[07:21:55] <jb0t> show us the code that includes the scope of the thing you need access to inside the swipe event handler. we can't help you because the question is obtuse
[07:24:15] <gtristan> note that the comment "Generic swipe handler for all directions" is incorrect from the example
[07:24:24] <gtristan> http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/demos/Single_swipe.html
[07:24:51] <KingMe> gtristan that is straight off the official website
[07:24:53] <gtristan> Interacting with the area below indicates that the 'swipeLeft' function is really only called for swipes in the left direction
[07:25:17] <gtristan> KingMe, and the official website has an erroneous comment, exactly.
[07:25:36] <gtristan> just pointing it out, in case you might be hitting that and expecting something different
[07:26:02] <KingMe> sigh how can I transform there example to the normal one
[07:26:14] <jb0t> what does that mean?
[07:26:30] <KingMe> http://pastebin.com/my6Bqvnx
[07:26:31] <jb0t> its an options object that lets you map your own handler for the swipeLeft event.
[07:27:09] <KingMe> its a function that calls a function that does something while the pastebin calls the function and does something
[07:28:05] <gtristan> KingMe, you are getting too caught up in what the arguments of the .swipe() function are, they are not 'abnormal' in any way, they just dont follow exactly the same pattern as jquery's .on() function does
[07:28:54] <KingMe> gtristan but I need to change it so it does as they both do the same thing
[07:29:06] <gtristan> no, you dont
[07:29:20] <gtristan> you just need to call the .swipe() function with the arguments it expects
[07:30:35] <jb0t> this would be a lot easier if you'd just show us all the code involved so we can try to answer your question about what you want, not what you think is wrong with one aspect of your code
[07:31:05] <jb0t> which may be misguided in general. which is typically the case when an answer can't be hashed out in 6 hrs
[07:31:26] <gtristan> this has been going on for 6 hrs ?
[07:31:28] <gtristan> omg
[07:31:46] <jb0t> you keeps saying its a problem of scope.  SHOW US THE SCOPE you're talking about
[07:32:51] <KingMe> you thing function {{function}} is the same as function{}
[07:32:57] <jb0t> the options object  is a common pattern in these jquery libs.
[07:33:03] <jb0t> you seem to not be getting it
[07:34:19] <KingMe> the example I see is function{ {function} } I just wanted it like this function{} but you guys tell me its the same and dont matter
[07:34:20] <jb0t> it's not the same. it's a config object. it gets parsed by the libraries init method.  in the example case, it overrides the internal leftSwipe method with whatever callback you define. all of that contained within the inner {}  <-- object
[07:34:41] <jb0t> the example you see is  function(object)
[07:34:45] <gtristan> KingMe, the outer {} is not a function, notice there is only one function
[07:35:33] <jb0t> again.  paste more of the code including the problem of scope. or we will continue chasing our tail trying to help you
[07:36:20] <KingMe> the problem is its written like this function {{function}} and I want it like this function{}
[07:36:47] <jb0t> it's a method call.  you have to abide by it's call sig
[07:36:52] <gtristan> KingMe, you cant always have what you want, unfortunately you have to call a function with the parameters it wants
[07:38:27] <KingMe> okay thanks will look for a plugin that can any recommendation? I need jQuery up swipe
[07:38:57] <jb0t> ...
[07:39:44] <granden> If I have a group of radio buttons with the name, color
[07:39:46] <jb0t> you realize what .swipe('swipeLeft'    does right?
[07:39:50] <granden> can I check if any one is checked?
[07:39:55] <granden> I dont really care which, just if any is
[07:39:57] <KingMe> jQuery only has left and right I needed up/down
[07:40:06] <jb0t> and what .swipe({...   does
[07:40:12] <KingMe> yes I know what it does I didnt use my exact code I just went with the example
[07:40:22] <gtristan> KingMe, there is no reason why this paste you made: http://pastebin.com/uL0zjUJc would not work perfectly when you perform a swipe to the left
[07:41:08] <gtristan> well, 'would not do exactly what your other sample' does in the .on() callback
[07:41:10] <KingMe> sigh okay try call jquery left/right then use that plugin and call up/down the same way
[07:41:13] <gtristan> more precisely
[07:41:34] * gtristan suspects that that plugin has more directions than 'left'
[07:41:41] <gtristan> would be a good guess
[07:41:57] <KingMe> but I already did the code with jQuery left/right...
[07:41:59] <jb0t> http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/docs/symbols/%24.fn.swipe.html#event:swipeUp
[07:42:14] <jb0t> granden: yep. exactly the same call signature
[07:42:31] <KingMe> so I just needed up/down...
[07:44:16] <granden> jb0t: In a if-statement would undefined be the same as false?
[07:44:23] <granden> If thats the case then sure yes.
[07:44:48] <granden> Or maybe if i did something like !! infront, it should return a true/false :)
[07:44:57] <jb0t> i never remember the specifics.. == probably .. === probably not
[07:46:21] <KingMe> Anyone know a plugin that does swipe events like this $("#canvas").on('swipeup',function(e){...} ?
[07:46:28] <granden> Ok, that way as well, tried my !! and it worked
[07:46:30] <jb0t> false == undefined   false
[07:46:56] <granden> if ( !! $('.color:checked').val() )
[07:47:07] <granden> that works
[07:47:31] <jb0t> i think theres a method for that
[07:47:44] <jb0t> prop
[07:47:53] <jb0t> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/426258/checking-a-checkbox-with-jquery
[07:49:36] <granden> Ok, thanks
[07:51:23] <abailarri> jb0t, I used moment with this: .swipe ( { swipeLeft: function () { ... your callback } })
[07:51:23] <abailarri> * EminenceHC (~eminenceh@206.169.99.194) ha entrat a #jquery
[07:51:23] <abailarri> <gtristan> KingMe, not $(pony).swipe ('swipeLeft', function () { ... the callback ...});
[07:51:23] <abailarri> <KingMe> I need   $("#canvas").on('touchstart mousedown',function(e){..}
[07:51:23] <abailarri> * stevo2 (~stevo@n058152248043.netvigator.com) ha entrat a #jquery
[07:51:24] <abailarri> <gtristan> at least it seems clear from the example URL you refer to, that .swipe() takes a configuration object
[07:51:27] <abailarri> <KingMe> I cant use $(pony).swipe ( { swipeLeft: function () { ... your callback } }) because of the scope
[07:51:29] <abailarri> <gtristan> I dont get it then... the scope problem I thought you were referring to was the IIFE from the example you refer to
[07:51:32] <abailarri> <gtristan> which is not ne
[07:51:34] <abailarri> sorry!
[07:51:52] <abailarri> I implemented with this var date = moment.unix(value.date).format('DD/MM - HH:mm'); and it return me an incorrect dat
[07:53:00] <gtristan> haha
[07:53:03] <KingMe> anyways I just found out how they did it. They set it up that way only because you can do multiple function in 1
[07:53:13] <Valduare> morning guys
[07:53:15] <gtristan> abailarri, lucky you didnt get a kline instaban for that ;-)
[07:53:33] <KingMe> function {{{}{}{}}} is possible
[07:54:52] <gtristan> sigh... yes KingMe ... I wouldnt describe it as such but yes, you can pass a configuration object with multiple functions defined as the members of that config object
[07:55:04] <KingMe> I am just trying to change it back to just function{} as I dont need the other function
[07:55:18] <gtristan> i.e. you can pass it { thisFunc : function () { ... }, thatFunc : function () { ... } }
[07:56:08] <gtristan> except that you cannot decide what the .swipe() function takes as it's arguments, you must abide by *its* api contract
[07:57:26] <gtristan> here... callSwipe (selector, method, callback) { var config = {}; config[method] = callback; selector.swipe (config) }
[07:57:40] <gtristan> KingMe, just copy/paste that ^^^
[07:58:10] <gtristan> and call: callSwipe ($('#canvas'), 'swipeLeft', function () { ... })
[07:58:12] <gtristan> instead
[07:58:33] <gtristan> if it grosses you out so much to use the API in the way that they defined it, just wrap it.
[07:59:19] <KingMe> I wanted to use jQuery and jQuery plugin but there not compatible I either gotta change the library source or just use one
[09:18:17] <niop> hi, i'm trying to simplify the dom structure by reducing it to only nodes that match selectors.  i used this $("*").filter('selector1', 'selector2'..) but if selector not found, the result is empty.  docs other than very lean jquery site? or command that might work?
[09:19:18] <arthurvr> niop: a jsfiddle/jsbin might be nice
[09:20:54] <niop> it works directly in console  $("*").filter('#main_content') gives 1 result Object { 0: <div#main_content.home_content>, length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument ‚Üí localhost:3000 }.
[09:21:16] <arthurvr> and it doesn‚Äôt work in your js file you mean?
[09:21:19] <niop> adding a second selector that doesn't exist in the dom,, returns empty.  not how i understood filter to work.
[09:21:40] <arthurvr> that‚Äôs the expected behaviour
[09:21:42] <niop> doesn't work in either console or in js file
[09:22:07] <niop> i've just checked jquery, w3 like sites, and there's not much explanation of how the command works.
[09:22:41] <niop> my guess was that it selects any node that matches any selector in the set
[09:22:42] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[09:22:42] <niop> obviously not
[09:22:54] <arthurvr> yeah but depends on how you use it
[09:23:19] <arthurvr> paste the code somewhere
[09:24:00] <niop> "The supplied selector is tested against each element; all elements matching the selector will be included in the result"
[09:24:39] <arthurvr> well yeah, that‚Äôs true right? (paste your code somewhere, it all depends on how you use it!)
[09:25:04] <arthurvr> also, $("*").filter('selector1', 'selector2‚Äô) must be $("*").filter('selector1, selector2'..)
[09:25:08] <arthurvr> is that what you want
[09:27:23] <niop> that's it. how simple. how did i overlook that. i guess examples around tend only to show selector with single element. but i think error admissable in part. thanks
[09:27:32] <jb0t> isnt' the * redundant there?
[09:27:43] <arthurvr> yes it is
[09:28:24] <arthurvr> $("*").filter('selector1, selector2'..) is the same as $('selector1, selector2‚Äô..)
[09:28:46] <jb0t> you might want to look at react. it uses a virtual dom. maybe that's what your trying to acheive
[09:29:45] <niop> heard the name.  might resort to that if thought useful, if it turns out presumably more basic facilties of jquery dont give the desired result.
[09:30:48] <niop> doing theme conversion and checking differences between doms, and going through html manually inspecting elements is time consuming.  wanting to condense the html.  filter might work though.
[09:31:07] <jb0t> yeah..thats EXACTLY what react was built to address.
[09:32:23] <niop> checking it out.. might provide more flexible filtering options.  thanks
[09:32:33] <jb0t> modifications to a virtual dom are very fast.  then it does an internal diff against the real dom using fancy heuristics and repaints the entire thing.  avoiding state change chaos
[09:33:30] <niop> could be promising..
[09:57:00] <Nialcen> Hi all. I try to check HTML content of all elements with "langType" class, and if it's equal to "English Forum", then find the next element with "topics-posts" class and change its html
[09:57:24] <Nialcen> However I can't really say I succeed Ahah ^^'
[09:57:31] <Nialcen> May you help =) ?
[09:59:41] <arthurvr> Nialcen: you just mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/
[10:00:31] <jb0t> $('.langType').children('.topic-posts').html('...')
[10:00:47] <arthurvr> if they‚Äôre nested that‚Äôs indeed an option
[10:00:49] <Nialcen> arthurvr, you're my savior, thank you :)
[10:01:17] <arthurvr> Nialcen: feel free to ask :-)
[10:01:54] <Nialcen> Hmm but, no sorry, it wont work, I change the fiddle
[10:01:59] <jb0t> i took 'next' to mean children. perhaps its just next element
[10:02:24] <Eels> Hey there!
[10:02:31] <arthurvr> Eels: hi!
[10:02:39] <Nialcen> http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/1/
[10:02:47] <jb0t> and i missed the condition .. soryr
[10:02:54] <Nialcen> Like this : there are multiple langType :)
[10:03:00] <arthurvr> use $.each
[10:03:12] <Eels> Is there a way to target sections with no visible dds that's better than $('section').not(':has("dd:visible")') ?
[10:03:20] <arthurvr> Nialcen: let me update my fiddle
[10:03:23] <Nialcen> I'm a bit confuse, I do not use often jQuery ^^
[10:04:45] <Nialcen> thank you arthurvr
[10:07:15] <arthurvr> Nialcen: http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/2/
[10:07:44] <arthurvr> Nialcen: better: http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/3/
[10:08:28] <Nialcen> Thank you !!
[10:09:18] <arthurvr> Nialcen: you‚Äôre welcome
[10:17:41] <Nialcen> arthurvr : well I thought I would be able to adapt it to my real code, but I failed :( sorry for disturbing you agin ^^' . Here the complete code : http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/5/
[10:18:13] <arthurvr> Nialcen: I‚Äôll take a look
[10:19:31] <arthurvr> Nialcen: you used ‚Äùenglish forum‚Äù in your html, I used "English class" in the code
[10:20:15] <Nialcen> I'm such a ... well thank you ^^
[10:20:17] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/6/
[10:36:16] <abailarri> Anyone can help me with a multiple each function please? http://jsfiddle.net/t1k8chmz/4/
[10:38:20] <abailarri> sorry this: http://jsfiddle.net/t1k8chmz/6/ is better
[10:39:03] <abailarri> or this http://jsfiddle.net/t1k8chmz/7/
[10:41:00] <Treyt22> abailari, this array/ is not self explanatory, its writing twice because you are nesting it into to foreach loops when one would be suficent for your sample data
[10:41:12] <Treyt22> two*
[10:45:11] <Nialcen> arthurvr ?
[10:45:24] <arthurvr> Nialcen: sup?
[10:46:03] <Nialcen> Admiting I would like to change the .lastpost, right after, how will I do that ?
[10:46:18] <Nialcen> i tried $elt.text() === "English Forum" && $elt.parent().next('.topics-posts').html('Subjects / Messages') && $elt.parent().next('.lastpost').html('Last post');
[10:46:45] <Nialcen> However, it do not work, nor the fact of duplicate the line :(
[10:47:06] <arthurvr> $.fn.html returns null, so is falsy
[10:47:24] <arthurvr> which means your && isn‚Äôt going to work
[10:47:37] <arthurvr> (FYI I just used it as an if-statement)
[10:47:46] <arthurvr> fiddle and I‚Äôll fix
[10:50:22] <Nialcen> http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/7/
[10:56:09] <Nialcen> I hope it's not too complicated :/ ?
[10:56:21] <arthurvr> oh sorry‚Ä¶ now looking
[10:57:05] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/dwrakenc/8/
[10:57:20] <arthurvr> .next() only selects the next element, remember? :-)
[10:57:27] <arthurvr> Nialcen: ^
[10:57:38] <Nialcen> Oooh ok
[10:57:42] <Nialcen> thank you :)
[10:57:49] <arthurvr> lol :-)

[12:06:09] <Nialcen> I try something from the moment you gave me the solution, but I have too admit I can't ^^
[12:06:12] <Nialcen> So
[12:06:19] <Nialcen> I'll fiddle
[12:06:26] <arthurvr> you‚Äôre welcome

[12:19:22] <arthurvr> hi Omar-!
[12:19:26] <Nialcen> Well, " Pas de message<br />&nbsp; " should have become "yay!"
[12:21:51] <arthurvr> Nialcen: works isn‚Äôt it?
[12:21:52] <arthurvr> http://temp.arthurverschaeve.be/wCIOTl.png
[12:22:25] <Omar-> hi arthurvr!
[12:22:26] <Nialcen> No
[12:22:44] <arthurvr> Nialcen: what should it do then?
[12:22:46] <Nialcen> Pas de message  should have became Yay! in my fiddle :)
[12:23:08] <arthurvr> Nialcen: it does that for me
[12:23:18] <arthurvr> Nialcen: in the ‚Äùenglish forum‚Äù section at least
[12:25:05] <Nialcen> All     'Pas de message'   after the Class langType link should become   Yay!    in my exemple
[12:25:23] <arthurvr> oh that‚Äôs your intent
[12:25:28] <arthurvr> I‚Äôll fiddle you a new one
[12:25:32] <Nialcen> So all     'Pas de message'   in my fiddle should have been changed
[12:30:19] <arthurvr> Nialcen: give me a minute, calling
[12:32:51] <Omar-> nighty everyone!
[12:33:49] <StatusFaction> Nialcen, why aren't you caching $elt.text() and using an if comparator ?
[12:44:04] <StatusFaction> Nialcen: http://jsfiddle.net/q92snup6/8/
[12:44:47] <Nialcen> waaaaow
[12:44:52] <Nialcen> Thank you !!
[12:46:27] <StatusFaction> But before you do that, you might want to risk running to #css or #html to see if you are using dt dd dl correctly.
[13:10:14] <rootbeam> Can I break out of multiple $.each functions or do I need to use a flag?
[13:14:11] <rangergord> hi
[13:14:28] <Valduare> hi
[13:15:55] <rangergord> newbie here. I'm looking at this line of code: "$('.spinner input').val(num);"  . Is it safe to say this does nothing?  The doc says it returns the value of an element.
[13:16:11] <rangergord> the fact that the author didn't assign it to a variable, means it does nothing, right?
[13:17:00] <tectonic> rangergord: it's setting the value of the input to num
[13:17:28] <rangergord> oh damn, didn't properly read the doc. my bad.
[13:18:42] <Valduare> hey guys I have some php search form, and a json file of locations, i‚Äôd like to filter the json data based on what was searched for _GET     how can I do this
[13:18:48] <Valduare> specificall for business type and zipcode
[13:19:42] <StatusFaction> rootbeam, yes you can break out of $.each() by returning false...I think.
[13:21:03] <rootbeam> StatusFaction: but if I have nested $.each loop and I want to break out of, say, 3rd "parent" loop?
[14:30:43] <Valduare> hows it going guys
[15:22:17] <Maciej__> Hello. Anyone can tell me why this selector does not work? $('#gameProgressBar' > ".progress" > ".progress-bar")

[15:22:56] <tectonic>  $('#gameProgressBar > .progress > .progress-bar")
[15:24:21] <Maciej__> oh..right, thanks

[15:38:55] <OnceMe> Hello
[15:39:05] <OnceMe> how can I prevent from loading content twice on double-click accident?
[15:39:09] <OnceMe> This happened to me right now ;(
[15:40:22] <tectonic> debounce
[15:40:55] <OnceMe> ?
[15:41:06] <OnceMe> can I use $(this).data("check";
[15:41:14] <OnceMe> and then $(this).removeData("check") ?
[15:41:18] <multi_io> are there selectors that select elements below a given elements or below all elements selected by another selector?
[15:42:50] <OnceMe> tectonic:
[15:43:10] <multi_io> i.e. selectors that take an element or a selector as one of their parameters (in addition to the selector string)
[15:43:13] <tectonic> multi_io: yes, look up + and ~
[15:43:34] <tectonic> OnceMe: look at the _.debounce method.  jQuery may have it too.
[15:46:46] <multi_io> tectonic: you mean next siblings selector etc.?
[15:46:54] <tectonic> isn't that what you wanted?
[15:47:05] <multi_io> not really
[15:47:13] <tectonic> do you mean children? >
[15:47:25] <multi_io> yeah
[15:47:44] <multi_io> and the parent is given as an actual element object
[15:47:45] <tectonic> Then the > selector gives you direct descendent
[15:47:54] <tectonic> Oh.  children()
[15:47:57] <multi_io> not as an id or anything
[15:48:06] <tectonic> $("#foo").children() then?
[15:48:19] <multi_io> that gives me all children
[15:48:27] <tectonic> $("#foo").children(".class") then?
[15:48:34] <multi_io> I want to apply the selector to them
[15:48:38] <multi_io> ah ok
[15:48:45] <tectonic> i believe
[15:48:56] <multi_io> yeah, that might be it. thanks, I'll check it out

[17:55:45] <iman> Hi, i dont' know what is wrong with this piece of code, http://jsfiddle.net/2s37e4ek/
[17:56:25] <iman> I am trying to get every single image inside images div
[20:34:06] <niop> hi, i have a theme site that uses  $('#temp_content').html('').load(et_site_data.site_url + event.value, function () {    to get back to the home page, where value there is '/'.  but it's causing a document.ready() event, when in the offical theme page i dont think that happens. is there something trick to address change, and changing url, without reloading the page?
[20:34:54] <niop> *some
[21:13:43] <niop> further to above, load doesn't trigger doc ready, for some reason, when #wrapper is put on the end of the url loaded.  but then it doesn't load the html page.
[21:31:08] <Eels> http://plakplek.be/test/backlog.html I can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong here. When I hide all of them and "show not done", "in progress" refuses to show.
[23:14:26] <desophos> hi, is there some sort of jquery functionality related to binding variables?
[23:16:14] <Eels> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8214642/jquery-bind-to-a-variable-event ?
[23:17:19] <Eels> http://api.jquery.com/?s=variable ?
[23:19:00] <Cork> Eels: about your earlier question, i would recommend removing all the .ready calls and wrap the function calls at the end instead
[23:19:06] <Cork> makes the code more readable
[23:19:29] <Cork> also cache the query results instead of running them over and over again
[23:19:49] <desophos> Eels: i was looking for http://api.jquery.com/jquery.proxy/
[23:21:42] <Eels> < jQuery newbie. Where do I start learning about caching query results?
[23:21:43] <Cork> Eels: also use classes instead of :contains
[23:21:56] <Cork> Eels: var cacheVariable = $('selector')
[23:23:42] <Cork> Eels: also what is it that isn't showing as you want it to?
[23:23:52] <Cork> can't find what it is you're talking about
[23:24:36] <Eels> When I hide all of em, show not done and then try to show In progress, it wont
[23:25:13] <Eels> There's a couple "In progress" in the Web section
[23:27:25] <Cork> Eels: you only show in progress that exist in hidden sections
[23:27:36] <Cork> if the section is already visible (by the not done) it is ignored
[23:28:11] <html5ius> hello - does anyone see any reason why this example - http://www.syntaxxx.com/accessing-user-device-photos-with-the-html5-camera-api/ - wouldn't work in chrome?
[23:29:22] <Eels> Cork: thanks! Don't see how I missed that ^^
[23:29:38] <Eels> Thanks for all of the tips, btw. It's much appreciated.
[23:41:36] <desophos> what's the difference between javascript bind and jquery proxy?
[23:42:40] <Cork> desophos: one is native and one does it by wrapping a function around the function you have
[23:43:42] <desophos> hm, ok
[23:44:54] <gtristan> is http://api.jquery.com/event.type/ supposed to work for all event types ?
[23:45:16] <Cork> yes
[23:45:36] <gtristan> I have a $(node).on ('dragenter dragover', function (e) { console.log (event.type) } <-- printing undefined :-S
[23:45:49] <Cork> gtristan: e != event
[23:45:50] <gtristan> err, 'e.type' ofcourse
[23:46:01] <gtristan> sorry, typo in chat, but not in code :-S
[23:46:21] <Eels> I cleaned it up a little, but now when I hide all sections and "Show done", it seems to skip (part of) the slideDown() animation. (or is that just me?)
[23:46:57] <gtristan> ah, sorry
[23:47:10] <gtristan> my mistake, it's something else in the console.log() which is undefined
