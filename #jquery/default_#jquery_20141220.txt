[01:54:49] <wodim> ok
[03:46:42] <ash_m> can I get a personal opinion from someone?
[04:04:45] <ash_m> I was wondering if anyone liked the hover states of http://jsfiddle.net/cfwhxsdn/ better than http://jsfiddle.net/93a0td9z/11/ ?
[04:21:02] <Guest__> suppose I send out an ajax request inside onbeforeunload, with no intention of processing the response, that's alright isn't it? The aim is to send a message to a server if they closed the window
[04:34:54] <sweet2k4> guys, i found this script to scroll to an anchor. how do i modify it to scroll to a <div id instad of <a name ? http://jsfiddle.net/BjpWB/4/
[04:36:03] <ash_m> sweet2k4: can I ask you a personal preference question?
[04:36:25] <sweet2k4> ash_m: sure :)
[04:36:39] <ash_m> which set of hover states do you like better? http://jsfiddle.net/7de2jx6o/ or http://jsfiddle.net/cfwhxsdn/1/ ?
[04:36:53] <ash_m> one is disjointed; the other is tandem
[04:39:39] <sweet2k4> well the first one seam to select the 2 diffirent "divs" independely, the second it seams that it dosnt matter were i click, i would expect the same result for the clikc
[04:40:15] <ash_m> sweet2k4: ironically, both would take you to the same destination as there is only 1 anchor link
[04:40:24] <ash_m> sweet2k4: across the whole thing
[04:40:58] <ash_m> sweet2k4: but do you have a personal preference between seeing the divs highlight individually vs together?
[04:41:04] <sweet2k4> ash_m: then i would say nr 2
[04:41:44] <ash_m> ya don't say. :P
[04:41:48] <ash_m> sweet2k4: thanks :)
[04:42:03] <sweet2k4> ash_m: i say the one with both highligted
[04:42:34] <sweet2k4> otherwise i might wounder what happens if i click the other link after i clicked the first, makes sens?
[04:43:08] <sweet2k4> ash_m: but thats just me :)
[04:43:18] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah. thanks! I will still have a bit of disjointment if the search result happens to be a product
[04:43:42] <ash_m> sweet2k4: ie http://jsfiddle.net/cfwhxsdn/2/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/7de2jx6o/1/
[04:44:34] <ash_m> sweet2k4: but you'll notice that this is more just to "emphasize" than to "denote clickable"
[04:45:24] <ash_m> sweet2k4: I'm hoping that the dashed outline will tip people off to the fact no matter where they click they'll be going to that result
[04:45:52] <sweet2k4> ash_m: well im not so sure about that, i think that ppl might miss that point
[04:46:12] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah; I'm starting to lean more toward your suggestion
[04:46:17] <sweet2k4> in this example. http://jsfiddle.net/7de2jx6o/1/ i would expect to se a larger image if i click the img, and product details if i clikc the text
[04:46:33] <ash_m> sweet2k4: I am still hoping that it becomes clear in the context of many search results
[04:47:18] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah; all goin' to the product page...
[04:47:39] <sweet2k4> ash_m: the dashed line would indicate that the information on click will be related to this product/ search result, still i think that i could expect a larger img when i click the img and product detials if i click the text
[04:47:55] <sweet2k4> but in this case it seams that it doesnt really matter since its all to the same page
[04:48:25] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah, the product page; incidentally; happens to have a larger image anyway
[04:48:48] <sweet2k4> ash_m: some sites provide a larger "popup" img when the img is clicked
[04:49:14] <sweet2k4> ash_m: but i dont think that would be any problem in this case tho
[04:49:15] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah, I could do a lightbox; but then I'm moving away from my own theme
[04:49:48] <ash_m> sweet2k4: just because I would have to remove the massive anchor and add a new one to the image... not hard but...
[04:50:03] <sweet2k4> im not suggesting that you should bring upp a popup, if you have a larger img in your product info it would matter
[04:50:15] <sweet2k4> wouldnt
[04:50:31] <ash_m> sweet2k4: I don't particularly want people to have to percisely click on the title to get to the product page and I dont feel like adding anchors to everything
[04:50:45] <juslintek> Hey anyone in here know how to check on dev tools lets say chrome inspector. Which events cause specific html element to change? And backtrack the line of code which did that.
[04:51:27] <ash_m> juslintek: you can but it's not particularly easy with chrome because it does not decifer the scripts for you...it's kinda globbed together usually
[04:51:58] <sweet2k4> ash_m: my final answer is my prefernce is all highlighted: like this example http://jsfiddle.net/cfwhxsdn/2/
[04:52:15] <juslintek> ash_m which tool you'd recommend me to use them and any links to tutorial for this?
[04:52:19] <sweet2k4> guys, i found this script to scroll to an anchor. how do i modify it to scroll to a <div id instad of <a name ? http://jsfiddle.net/BjpWB/4/
[04:52:20] <ash_m> sweet2k4: thanks
[04:52:27] <sweet2k4> ash_m: np
[04:52:45] <ash_m> juslintek: I personally like FF native inspector for that
[04:53:19] <juslintek> ash_m so how to do that on ff inspector then?
[04:54:31] <ash_m> juslintek: on the "inspector" tab (equivalent to "elements" on chrome) you just navigate to the element in question; a little bubble "[ev]" will appear to the right of the element opening tag...
[04:54:45] <ash_m> juslintek: when you click it; it shows you all the evernts that are attached to that element
[04:54:52] <ash_m> juslintek: it also tells you if they bubble
[04:55:12] <juslintek> ash_m, awesome, thanx a lot :-)
[04:55:13] <ash_m> juslintek: each event is clickable so you can see what code (isolated) executes
[04:55:29] <ash_m> juslintek: it's just a little cleaner than sifting through chrome
[04:55:46] <ash_m> juslintek: I like chrome; though; for tracking down scss properties
[04:56:30] <juslintek> Some people recommended me https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/ for AIO
[04:56:33] <juslintek> tracking
[04:56:39] <juslintek> All In One :-D
[04:57:29] <ash_m> scss can be configured to display comments about which line generated the following code; so if you want to know where a rule came from in chrome, you can just click on the stylesheet in the upper right-hand corner and boom; it takes you directly to the comment that tells what created that rule
[04:57:45] <ash_m> juslintek: I haven't used it; I'll bookmark and check it out later.
[04:59:18] <ash_m> sweet2k4: thanks for helping me... I wish I knew the answer to your question :\
[05:28:59] <sweet2k4> ash_m: np, i solved it, it was quite easy when took the time to understand exactly what the script did.
[05:29:17] <ash_m> sweet2k4: woot!
[05:29:35] <sweet2k4> ash_m: nvm :)
[05:35:12] <sweet2k4> ash_m: if you dont mind i have a little opinion question for you: what is you first impression of this site. http://www.onedeal.nu/
[05:35:28] <sweet2k4> all the deals are dummy deals so the text isnt accurate
[05:37:25] <ash_m> sweet2k4: not bad; it seems almost too simple though; percisely I would say clean but it makes me feel like it's selling hype merchandise
[05:39:16] <sweet2k4> ash_m: yeah ok, well its like the first deal on to is ment to be a very special deal that comes once a week
[05:39:39] <ash_m> sweet2k4: makes sense.
[05:39:57] <sweet2k4> ash_m: what do you mean about too simple
[05:40:07] <sweet2k4> you would expect more text?
[05:41:42] <ash_m> sweet2k4: I'm not trying to berate your site at all; so I'd rather not elaborate; but simple (or "clean") can be good or bad; I would say it's a matter of preference
[05:43:41] <sweet2k4> ash_m: no dont get me wrong, i didnt think you breate the site, just trying to understand your oppinon. critism are more then welcome! (if you have any)
[05:44:29] <sweet2k4> ash_m: what about the size layout did you get any negativ reaction to that?
[05:44:42] <sweet2k4> layout size
[05:46:57] <ash_m> sweet2k4: for my particular taste; it needs like a little more structure stylistically ... I think the graphics are very good and really tie the top together; but I would prefer to see more separation between the sections; and the standard deals are a bit overwhelming...
[05:48:43] <ash_m> sweet2k4: on this particular monitor; the bottom of hero image was cut off
[05:48:58] <ash_m> sweet2k4: Ironically; this worked as a plus for me
[05:49:34] <ash_m> sweet2k4: I wanted to believe that the hero image was poking out from underneath something and was mildly disappointed to see that it was not
[05:49:50] <sweet2k4> ash_m: thanks for the comments, i get your point about the smaler deals to be a bit overwhelming. that is true, and i will try to seperate them from the top deal more clearly
[05:50:33] <sweet2k4> poking out from underneath?
[05:50:52] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah... I'll make a fiddle
[05:51:44] <sweet2k4> ash_m: you mean like animated in from underneath?
[05:52:54] <ash_m> sweet2k4: no... hold on
[05:53:12] <sweet2k4> ash_m: alright, thanks dude
[05:53:14] <juslintek> what is the best way to get lenghts of all li to the left of the this li?
[05:59:52] <Zapsoda_> I have a getInfo function that sets a few varibles in the success method of a getJSON ajax call but I have another function thats called after that one and uses varibles set in the first like username to fill in sections of the page. My problem is that I keep getting " Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined" and I've found its because the ajax call isn't finished until after the username is referenced, What can I do
[05:59:52] <Zapsoda_> to make the second function wait for the first to finish
[06:17:25] <sweet2k4> ash_m: you dont have to use all your day just to help me :) its ok :)
[06:17:55] <ash_m> sweet2k4: it's good for me to templatize my ideas... sorry it's taking so long though; it shouldn't :P
[06:19:38] <sweet2k4> ash_m: i see, if does benefit you then sure :) take your time, its np
[06:38:28] <ash_m> sweet2k4: k, your layout looks something like this, right? http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/
[06:39:06] <sweet2k4> ash_m: yeah
[06:40:03] <sweet2k4> ash_m: if you add a foother it would be exactly like i have
[06:40:27] <ash_m> sweet2k4: my suggestion is like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/1/
[06:42:20] <sweet2k4> ash_m: you mean like no margin between the hero and content?
[06:42:29] <sweet2k4> ash_m: or overlap?
[06:43:16] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah, here's a box-shadow for clearification: http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/2/
[06:45:26] <sweet2k4> ash_m: so wich one overlap? the content or hero? in this example it looks like the content
[06:46:32] <frabblerock> hey
[06:46:55] <frabblerock> I'm doing some simple validation on a password type input field
[06:47:07] <frabblerock> and it's returning empty even when not empty
[06:47:11] <frabblerock> am I missing something?
[06:47:12] <Amaal> What's the most efficient cross platform way to implement a one-to-one chat system?
[06:48:29] <ash_m> sweet2k4: does the box-shadow not help
[06:50:15] <ash_m> sweet2k4: http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/4/
[06:50:46] <sweet2k4> ash_m: that would cover the text on the hero?
[06:50:52] <sweet2k4> one sec i show oyu
[06:53:25] <sweet2k4> ash_m: brb need to take care of the laundery back in 10
[06:55:28] <ash_m> sweet2k4: it doesn't necessarily need to "make sense"... it can just come up from a stylized drop-shadow
[07:05:13] <sweet2k4> ash_m: this is how i understand your suggestion: http://sv.tinypic.com/r/5be2qe/8
[07:05:21] <sweet2k4> back btw
[07:07:23] <ash_m> sweet2k4: yeah... possibly add a background texture behind the hero-image
[07:11:08] <sweet2k4> ash_m: well i cant really hide the content of the hero? i would have to do someting more like this to keep the btn visble http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/8/
[07:12:21] <sweet2k4> ash_m: http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/9/
[07:17:15] <ash_m> sweet2k4: or something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/10/
[07:17:36] <ash_m> sweet2k4: it doesn't *have* to be distinguished
[07:17:51] <ash_m> sweet2k4: but it's nice to add a tapering effect
[07:20:05] <sweet2k4> ash_m: yeah ok, i play around with your exaples, thanks for your suggestions :)
[07:27:00] <ash_m> sweet2k4: or maybe something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jj2s6fg8/12/
[07:28:10] <sweet2k4> ash_m: yeah, thats how im setting it up right now
[07:29:15] <juslintek> does ff take priority to css over js?
[07:29:34] <juslintek> Because what works on chrome like settings with and margin doesn't work on ff
[07:45:01] <juslintek> Anyone used superfish script before?
[07:45:10] <juslintek> If yes, how to disable it on some submenus?
[07:45:28] <juslintek> for example make it not to run if ul class is something
[08:14:31] <clearcut> im starting to get a lot of these websites from my clients, so im thinking to start reseller hosting - what are the best options for resellers in your expirience if you had any?
[08:21:22] <daylum> when using .clone(), are there bindings cloned as well?
[08:23:15] <shoky> daylum:  .clone(true) does
[08:23:21] <shoky> `api clone
[08:23:22] <b-ot> shoky: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:23:42] <daylum> awesome thx, and sorry for me being stupid :3
[08:51:51] <sharpy35_> hey guys, what is the best way to check if an string contains any numbers from 0-9 in arbitrary length?
[08:52:14] <sharpy35_> and maybe remove that numbers if that string contains any
[08:53:48] <lapidary> you mean with a regular expression?
[08:55:41] <sharpy35_> @lapidary: yeah
[08:58:23] <daylum> sharpy35_, a regex match and replace.
[08:59:01] <sharpy35_> i must admit i am a regex noob
[08:59:12] <sharpy35_> can you help me out with a snippet? daylum?
[08:59:29] <Robdgreat> foo.replace(/[0-9]/, '');
[08:59:43] <daylum> ^
[08:59:57] <daylum> also, for playing: https://www.regex101.com/#javascript
[09:00:17] <Robdgreat> or foo.replace(/[0-9]/g, '');
[09:00:20] <sharpy35_> thanks dudes !
[09:00:24] <sharpy35_> will test that out
[09:00:38] <Robdgreat> cheers
[09:03:10] <lapidary> has anyone here used a table sorter plugin?
[09:03:58] <Robdgreat> lapidary: like datatables?
[09:04:37] <lapidary> look pretty
[09:05:16] <sharpy35_> @lapidary: does the regex pattern also match like foo34594930 and would cut the numbers?
[09:05:37] <Robdgreat> sharpy35_: what did it do when you tried it?
[09:05:45] <lapidary> cut each digit the way its written now
[09:06:22] <lapidary> if you want to group all the numbers do [0-9]?*
[09:06:34] <lapidary> that will match 1+ numbers in a row
[09:07:08] <sharpy35_> ok thanks will try that
[09:07:27] <BillCriswell> sharpy35_: That's unneeded for that task.
[09:07:43] <lapidary> True
[09:07:58] <sharpy35_> why is it?
[09:08:03] <lapidary> if you are deleting all number, that will delete each number one by one
[09:08:15] <lapidary> oh not it won't
[09:08:27] <Robdgreat> the command I gave with the g flag will do it.
[09:08:29] <lapidary> because you didnâ€™t through g
[09:08:43] <lapidary> â€¦ or you did give g
[09:08:54] <lapidary> never mind, Robdgreat is right
[09:08:57] <sharpy35_> ah ok thanks guys :)
[09:09:08] <Robdgreat> http://jsfiddle.net/9mtn0p2L/
[09:09:09] <sharpy35_> its working now
[09:09:28] <Robdgreat> I try to make a point of being right before opening my mouth, virtually or otherwise :)
[09:10:26] <sharpy35_> haha thats a good advice ;)
[09:10:48] <Robdgreat> I'm sure you know far too many people who never bother
[09:10:52] <Robdgreat> I know I do
[09:11:34] <lapidary> Iâ€™m better when my toddler isnâ€™t dreaming behind me.  That makes me punchy
[09:27:52] <diegoviola> hi
[09:28:16] <diegoviola> I need to do some wizards (multi-page dialogs) on the front-end, I'm using rails on the backend, it looks like I can do that sort of thing with just jquery
[09:28:27] <diegoviola> but shouldn't I be using angularjs/emberjs for this?
[09:28:31] <diegoviola> what would you guys recommend?
[09:49:12] <BillCriswell> diegoviola: Depends on how complicated it can get.
[09:50:51] <BillCriswell> and how comfortable you are with the tools, how much time you have to get it done, etc
[09:53:20] <diegoviola> BillCriswell: I'm comfortable with rails (I've been using it since 2008)
[09:53:27] <diegoviola> I'm also comfortable with jQuery
[09:53:48] <diegoviola> however, everyone is using ember/angular these days and I like what I see from such apps, they tend to be very fast and responsive
[09:54:05] <diegoviola> and I have about a month to decide and 3 months to finish an app
[09:54:17] <diegoviola> the application is not very big though
[09:54:32] <BillCriswell> Oh, then might be worth learning one of them.
[09:54:47] <diegoviola> BillCriswell: ember or angular you mean?
[09:54:52] <BillCriswell> yes
[09:54:55] <diegoviola> right
[09:54:58] <bacobart> wouldn't pick angular though, the api is going to change in the next major version
[09:55:31] <BillCriswell> Yeah, completely changing.
[09:55:38] <BillCriswell> I've been investing my time in Vue.
[09:56:20] <bacobart> i've been using knockout. there are lots of alternatives :) but now would be a bad time to invest in learning angular as it would be kinda wasted...
[09:56:29] <diegoviola> most of those frameworks rely on jquery for DOM manipulation right?
[09:56:31] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[09:56:34] <diegoviola> they just provide routing, controllers, etc
[09:57:02] <BillCriswell> diegoviola: I think they use it if it's available but can be used without it.
[09:57:17] <diegoviola> I see
[09:58:39] <diegoviola> thanks guys
[09:59:06] <diegoviola> there's so much to choose in front-end these days
[09:59:16] <BillCriswell> diegoviola: Yeah, pretty daunting at times.
[09:59:32] <diegoviola> :)
[10:01:29] <BillCriswell> I dig it though, keeps me on my toes.
[10:12:42] <Amaal> Anyone knows a good free host where I can host my node.js app?

[12:58:17] <Pattt> hi
[13:02:49] <Pattt> any suggestions on infinite scrolling plugin?
[14:05:22] <puchacz> guys, I have a problem - to load an arbitrary content into iframe and grow iframe's height to match the loaded document height
[14:06:34] <puchacz> http://jsfiddle.net/u3o8ykkk/
[14:06:39] <puchacz> is my "hack"
[14:06:45] <puchacz> it works as follows
[14:06:56] <puchacz> first I try to append 1x1 pixel image at the bottom of the body
[14:07:21] <puchacz> I try to find its offset().top
[14:07:55] <puchacz> if it fails, I try to iterate through all elements in the document and find the largest offset().top in there
[14:08:12] <puchacz> it is sorta working for many websites
[14:08:22] <puchacz> but it fails on many of them too
[14:08:26] <puchacz> pls help
[14:12:13] <puchacz> shall I use iframe-auto-ehight possibly?
[14:13:37] <wa5ted> Velveeta: anyways you can help dissect the scroll on this page http://www.benoitchalland.com/projects

[14:44:25] <Guest57907> I have probably a dumb question. I am using jquery to send an ajax request and the dataType is "json". The response is saved to a variable "response". If the values are strings, I can access them like, response.string. But how do I access a 2d response? Like for example response.array.firstval or response.array.secondval are undefined. I hope I'm making sense.
[14:59:17] <Pattt> hello ?
[15:07:45] <Amaal> Wow. Are all node.js hosts this hard to use?
[15:13:26] <mdev> var selectedItem = $("#right_values option:selected"); that gets all the selected for a multiselect comobobox
[15:13:31] <mdev> but how do I delete those after?
[15:13:36] <mdev> append adds, but how to delete?
[15:13:43] <mdev> .remove not doing anything
[15:15:10] <shoky> mdev: .remove() should work. make a jsfiddle/testcase
[15:19:34] <mdev> yeah you're right, thanks
[15:24:18] <shoky> cheers :)
[16:38:43] <mdev> so I have the html code 3 times, 2 instances are hidden with display:none, reason is when I change the combobox entry I want it to show the difference instance
[16:38:57] <mdev> with related stuff, anyway my problem is they all have same ids on the controls
[16:39:10] <mdev> did that because it's easier to pull the data, but it's messed up/not working
[16:39:16] <mdev> because multiple instances of the id
[16:39:24] <mdev> anyway to do like
[16:39:34] <mdev> $('#theid 1').whatever
[16:39:40] <mdev> theid 2 etc...
[16:39:51] <mdev> as in the first one found with the id, second etc...
[16:40:57] <mdev> nevermind i'll google
[16:41:04] <mdev> I suppose I should remove the ids entirely and just use same class
[16:49:16] <Guest_> I've got an ajax call inside onbeforeunload. The request goes out *only* when the inspector is open.
[16:59:06] <mdev> $(".left_values option:selected").first();
[16:59:22] <mdev> that only finds first selected of the .left_values class
[16:59:35] <mdev> I want to find the first .left_values class and get all the option:selected values
[16:59:52] <mdev> which $(".left_values option:selected") gets
[17:00:29] <mdev> like $(".left_values").first().("option:selected");
[17:00:33] <mdev> not sure how to write it though
[17:01:17] <mdev> guess my question too tough for the chan tonight, dang
[17:01:32] <mdev> don't worry about it, i'll find the answer
[17:02:29] <mdev> and i'll share it when I do, to help teach you guys
[17:04:50] <mdev> you can do what I want like so
[17:04:53] <mdev> $(".left_values").first().children("option:selected");
[17:05:14] <mdev> finds first instance of .left_values, then pulls results matching option:selected which is all the selected ones
[17:05:17] <mdev> your welcome
[17:05:55] <mdev> if you need to match other instances you can use eq
[17:06:02] <mdev> $(".left_values").eq(1).children("option:selected");
[17:06:05] <mdev> etc..
[17:30:57] <mdev> I wish jquery did a divide and conquer approach to finding things
[17:31:08] <mdev> like selected items as it's super slow with 40k items
[17:31:15] <mdev> i'm assuming because it's going top to bottom
[17:58:41] <Dan42> Hi All. I've encountered a problem to which there doesn't seem to be a lot of help and reference online. I'm developing an app using Trigger.io and when running on Androind 4.4, it seems Webview is having a problem when local asset URI is translated by jquery-mobile with an additional "//" leading to a uri looking like:  content://// which breaks webview. Help...? :)

[20:34:34] <toothe> I'm trying to have an alert() generate when I change a select
[20:34:45] <toothe> I did: var scopes = $()
[20:34:47] <toothe> woops..
[20:37:46] <toothe> http://dpaste.com/1FHYKCX
[20:38:13] <toothe> but when I change any of the <SELECT>'s whose class is "scope", nothing happens.
[21:13:22] <toothe> gah
[21:13:39] <toothe> im expecting to get an alert() when I change a <SELECT>, but it doesn't happen
[21:31:55] <toothe> fixed it
[22:49:14] <toothe> how do you do a popup window with jQuery?
[23:42:32] <wa5ted> toothe: still need a hand with that
[23:42:37] <wa5ted> you are looking for a modal
