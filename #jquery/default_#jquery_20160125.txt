[00:48:48] <slavka`_> hey guys, if i got a parameter like window.foo.boo.doo.goo.key = "xxx" ...  how can i check if window.foo.boo.doo.goo.key isset... , considering that foo or boo or any thing under window may not exist
[00:50:00] <slavka`_> i.e. basically i want to know if there way i can validate the parameter and all the other parent parameters in the path to that parameter
[03:06:11] <hellyeah> hey anyone arouınd?
[03:19:05] <jquery531> hi
[03:19:25] <jquery531> is there anybody who can help me with a simple JSON question?
[03:19:49] <hellyeah> you need to fiddle it
[03:20:44] <jquery531> I have this JSON [{"loc":"2"},{"test":"yes"},[{"option":"width"},{"option":"height"},{"option":"weight"}]]
[03:21:19] <jquery531> I can get "loc" value by this: JSON.parse(data)[0]['loc']
[03:21:33] <jquery531> but...how can I get option values?
[03:22:33] <jquery531> @hellyeah I think it's a stupid question, but I can't solve it...
[03:22:59] <hellyeah> hmm i am kinda stupid guy :)
[03:23:12] <jquery531> lol
[03:23:14] <hellyeah> so you want to get the value of loc?
[03:23:21] <jquery531> no no
[03:23:34] <jquery531> I already get it by JSON.parse(data)[0]['loc']
[03:23:46] <jquery531> i need to get "option" values
[03:25:26] <hellyeah> hmm thats just a guess
[03:25:41] <hellyeah> it seems there are three option values and you want to get one by one
[03:26:00] <hellyeah> may be you can do foreach and get the option value with element.option
[03:26:09] <hellyeah> i am not so experienced you can try it
[03:55:53] <DirtyFinn> jquery531, I hope here is something you can works with: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dGdBZK
[04:50:11] <zagaza-> hi guys, how can I change the select options based on clicking the numbered buttons? So if I click button "1" I want option "1" to be selected. https://jsfiddle.net/Le4s12d5/
[04:51:42] <DirtyFinn> $('#one').on('click', function(){ //One was clicked });
[04:52:03] <DirtyFinn> or do you mean like switch?
[04:52:09] <zagaza-> like switch yes
[04:52:12] <DirtyFinn> ok
[04:58:20] <DirtyFinn> zagaza-, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dGdxNE
[04:59:29] <zagaza-> thanks :) I'll see what I can do with it
[05:36:50] <dunaeth> Hi, any idea why jquery selector returns removed elements after using .html function to change the content ?
[05:38:19] <dunaeth> Ie. $('my selector') gives me a,b,c elements, then I replace part of the page content with .html method, thus removing a,b and c elements from the dom, and the same selector after .html method is still returning removed elements
[05:39:39] <DirtyFinn> can you show us some code? just to make sure there's no typos or something :)
[05:43:06] <dunaeth> DirtyFinn, https://jsfiddle.net/pvkkck5L/
[05:44:22] <dunaeth> Hmmm w8 a minute, I think I know what's goin on ;)
[05:51:41] <DirtyFinn> why not $('#context').append($('<div id="testJquery">')); ? not that it solves the problem but... :)
[05:55:59] <dunaeth> Actually, the trouble relies in another script that mess with this one
[06:49:59] <hellyeah> shoky: can we discuss about beforeshownday function
[06:50:01] <hellyeah> ?
[06:50:06] <hellyeah> if you are available
[06:52:13] <shoky> hellyeah: i'm just about to leave for work.. got 3 min for ya if that helps ;p
[06:52:42] <hellyeah> sure
[06:52:48] <hellyeah> i just try to briefly explain
[06:52:49] <shoky> and i ask again, please enough with the useless questions everyday "is anyone around"
[06:52:55] <shoky> why do i have to keep asking?
[06:53:09] <hellyeah> i will give up thats just annoying thing
[06:53:14] <shoky> very
[06:53:30] <shoky> i'm almost always here when you say that btw :)
[06:53:40] <shoky> if you'd just ask a question, i'd probably reply
[06:53:54] <xec> or someone else will chime in :)
[06:53:55] <shoky> (and ask it in general, don't ask it of me)
[06:54:06] <hellyeah> what does chrime in mean?
[06:54:26] <xec> chime in, means to assist basically
[06:54:48] <xec> if you ask one person, noone else will care to answer or help
[06:56:16] <xec> if the question requires too much context, do yourself the favor and reduce the case. it not only will help us help you, but very often it will lead you to find the problem yourself
[06:56:38] <hellyeah> you do foreach here first you set boolean value and you get the dates from spesific input box. and you make false condition and you make enabled false to exit the loop as you meantioned if "if" condition" is not true then you return bool and you go on foreach loop and thanks to this dates are disabled http://dpaste.com/2BPZGM5 is that true?
[06:56:59] <hellyeah> xec: gotcha
[06:59:01] <shoky> hellyeah: i go through previous rows datepickers and check if the current checked date is in one of their ranges. if so i set enabled to false yes.  the "return false" is just an optimization to exit the .each loop early, because there's no need to keep iterating once i already set it to false
[06:59:48] <hellyeah> shoky: ic
[07:00:04] <hellyeah> so you have "date" parameter for current selected date
[07:00:09] <shoky> no
[07:00:12] <shoky> for current CHECKED date
[07:00:27] <hellyeah> ops sorrry for my language
[07:00:30] <shoky> jquery ui calls your beforeShowDay handler for each date that it wants to show
[07:00:37] <shoky> to check if you want it to be enabled or not
[07:00:45] <hellyeah> okey ic that then you got all pervious dates from "from" and "to"
[07:00:49] <shoky> has nothing to do with current selected date
[07:01:13] <hellyeah> if (date >= from && date <= to)
[07:01:17] <shoky> yes, the code is pretty self explanatory.
[07:01:23] <hellyeah> yes
[07:01:39] <hellyeah> i understood
[07:01:43] <shoky> great
[07:01:46] <shoky> can i go :D
[07:01:46] <hellyeah> thank you shoky
[07:01:49] <hellyeah> sure
[07:01:51] <hellyeah> :D
[07:02:40] <shoky> cool. seeya laters. and you, xec - i see you
[07:02:54] <xec> cya shoky :D
[07:03:20] <hellyeah> take care
[07:12:57] <cin_> hi
[07:14:27] <cin_> i have a problem with dropable elements, i have a div.dropArea initial width: 100%; and height: 0; with transition when user is dragging it get's heigth: 40px; but then jquery doesn't fire the drag events on the dropArea
[07:14:32] <cin_> any suggestions?
[07:15:13] <everson> Hi all. I'm loading a form with some pre-populated data in a textarea element. Is there any way to make the textarea automatically adjust it's height to fit its content so that the user doesn't have to resize / scroll?
[07:15:25] <everson> (preferably no 3rd party plugins)
[07:16:38] <cin_> i know that it's because of the transistion effect. if i set it straight to 40px w/o effect it works as expected. Is there maybe any workaround?
[07:17:16] <hellyeah> do you know about jqx calendar?
[07:24:21] <AlexRussia> Hey! What is most efficient way to update part of page by timeout with simple ability to stop these 'timeouted' updates?
[07:26:15] <hellyeah> how to select element which doesnt have a spesific class?
[07:26:46] <slax0r> AlexRussia: timeoutId = setTimeout(closure, timeout);
[07:26:56] <slax0r> and I want to say, stopTimeout(timeoutId), but I am not really sure
[07:27:02] <slax0r> if that is the right function
[07:27:08] <DirtyFinn> by spesific id the element should have
[07:28:07] <hellyeah> check this example http://jsfiddle.net/UN5Nv/15/ there is an already picked date and other dates. I couldnt know how i can select already picked dates between 7-15
[07:29:22] <AlexRussia> slax0r: oh, thanks, setTimeout is standard funciton or jQuery one?
[07:29:30] <slax0r> AlexRussia: vanila js
[07:29:46] <DirtyFinn> do you have Date.js? doesn't it have something like .range([startDate],[endDate]) or something?
[07:30:56] <hellyeah> this is jqx calendar
[07:31:28] <hellyeah> i just try to discover if it has that option can be really nice
[07:31:47] <hellyeah> i just try to select dates that are in rangr 7-17 from jquery
[07:31:53] <AlexRussia> slax0r: okay :)
[07:33:12] <cin_> hellyeah: are you trying to select the dates via the plugin or do you want to get the elements with jquery
[07:34:00] <hellyeah> with jquery  i did that bur probably wont work $('.jqx-calendar-cell-selected');
[07:34:22] <cin_> #that's by plugin $("#jqxCalendar").jqxCalendar('setRange', date1, date2);
[07:34:51] <cin_> and $('.jqx-calendar-cell-selected') works
[07:35:01] <hellyeah> for 7-15?
[07:35:04] <cin_> (if they have been selected)
[07:35:06] <hellyeah> for getting 7-15?
[07:35:16] <cin_> if they are in selected state
[07:35:18] <cin_> yes
[07:35:24] <hellyeah> let me tell what i try to do
[07:35:35] <cin_> are you testing this in debugger tools ?
[07:35:40] <hellyeah> i try to colorize days are selected like in that example
[07:35:44] <hellyeah> yes
[07:35:45] <cin_> maybe you are not in the right context in jsfiddle
[07:36:04] <DirtyFinn> after people have tried to help him, he finally decided to tell what he wanted :)
[07:36:06] <hellyeah> in above you will see random hex code thing
[07:36:27] <cin_> hellyou: there is a dropdown somewhere where you can select the context, unless you have selected jsfiddle the console will not work as you expecting
[07:36:30] * hellyeah people have so many demands
[07:36:48] * hellyeah sometimes i am confused hahah
[07:38:41] <hellyeah> got what i want
[07:38:55] <hellyeah> cin_: it works now
[07:39:11] <lordjancso> hi
[07:39:15] <hellyeah> i prefer just get 7-8-9... 15 http://jsfiddle.net/UN5Nv/16/
[07:40:01] <lordjancso> i'm trying to use pjax on my website, but i have a lot of other jquery libraries and they just dont work when pjax enabled (i guess because they are not 'live'), could somebody help me with this?
[07:40:10] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:40:19] <hellyeah> val() doesnt work here any tips http://jsfiddle.net/UN5Nv/17/
[07:40:53] <hellyeah> i am not so experienced but
[07:41:08] <hellyeah> your jquery files are at the end of body?
[07:43:00] <DirtyFinn> lordjancso, sometimes libraries conflict with eachother. that why we have to be careful what libraries we use. but can you call pjax.method() instead of method() ?
[07:43:10] <DirtyFinn> *that's
[07:43:34] <hellyeah> be carefuukl it must be at the end of body
[07:43:59] <hellyeah> and you may need order correctly
[07:44:05] <hellyeah> brb
[07:44:25] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn i mean i'm using pjax, which is fine, working without any problem, but for example i have a slick (jquery libary) slideshow on a page. so if i navigate there, slick wont be initiated, because of pjax ajax call
[07:45:40] <DirtyFinn> lordjancso, "because of pjax ajax call". exactly. library conflict
[07:46:03] <DirtyFinn> or do you mean the ajax call never returns stuff on time?
[07:46:09] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn so what should i do now? i'm not that expert in frontend stuff :)
[07:46:50] <DirtyFinn> depends on what you want. I'd start from removing any conflicting library
[07:47:04] <DirtyFinn> and would try to find a workaround
[07:49:41] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn i just want to make slick slideshow live
[07:49:53] <lordjancso> so i just create this slideshow like this:
[07:50:05] <lordjancso> $('div.slideshow').slick(...blah...blah...
[07:50:32] <DirtyFinn> and that works?
[07:52:00] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn yeah if i press an F5
[07:52:10] <lordjancso> because its in document ready
[07:52:24] <DirtyFinn> so what's the problem?
[07:53:46] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn i load content with PJAX
[07:53:50] <lordjancso> so with ajax
[07:53:59] <lordjancso> i just replace my documents content
[07:54:15] <lordjancso> so i load my website (everything loaded with a single http request)
[07:54:27] <lordjancso> then i click to a link and here comes pjax
[07:54:51] <lordjancso> so no full page refresh, just an ajax call and replace the page content (just replace a single div)
[07:55:06] <lordjancso> BUT
[07:55:24] <lordjancso> if i have something in the content (for example a jquery slideshow), then i should initialize it
[07:55:27] <lordjancso> somehow
[07:55:32] <lordjancso> thats what i dont know how
[07:56:20] <DirtyFinn> so the slider is inside the div you are "refreshing"? why not move it outside of it?
[07:57:16] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn yes, and because i can not
[07:57:25] <lordjancso> i no need slideshow for every page :)
[07:57:47] <DirtyFinn> ooooh. now i get what you try to do
[07:58:18] <lordjancso> thats good... :)
[07:58:34] <lordjancso> sorry, maybe i said it in a too complicated way
[07:59:27] <DirtyFinn> what aboutif you do $('div.slideshow').slick(blah...blah...blah...) at the success part of your ajax?
[08:01:15] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn yeah that would work, but i'm just trying to find a more simple way
[08:02:12] <DirtyFinn> spoiler: there is none :)
[08:02:13] <lordjancso> because i have a lot of library used (some jquery library for menu, carousel, slideshow, etc...) so now i have to wrap everthing into a function (e.g. refreshFunction()) then i call that function in the success party of the ajax request
[08:02:39] <DirtyFinn> souns smart
[08:02:46] <lordjancso> but its not my sitebuild and not my frontend logic, i just got the stuff and i'm doing backend development for this application
[08:03:09] <DirtyFinn> ok
[08:05:28] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn i should somehow re-throw jquery ready event
[08:05:33] <lordjancso> that would solve my problem
[08:05:40] <lordjancso> is this possible?
[08:07:27] <DirtyFinn> you could wrap your jquery code in differentFunction(){//jquery here} and then in jquery's ready function call differentFunction(). this way you can load all jquery when you do differentFunction;
[08:07:36] <DirtyFinn> not sure if that's smart though
[08:08:28] <DirtyFinn> sounds like you could do much better if you re-did the whole jquery and page structure... but I guess that's not appealing option :)
[08:09:29] <lordjancso> hmm
[08:09:31] <lordjancso> let me think
[08:11:11] <lordjancso> DirtyFinn here is my solution
[08:11:22] <lordjancso> i moved all my logic from ready event to a custom event
[08:11:31] <lordjancso> so i just modified this:
[08:11:41] <DirtyFinn> sounds good
[08:11:45] <lordjancso> $(document).ready(function() { ...my code... });
[08:11:48] <lordjancso> to this:
[08:11:55] <lordjancso> $(document).bind('_page_ready', function () { ..my code..});
[08:12:05] <DirtyFinn> looks good
[08:12:15] <lordjancso> and in document ready i trigger my event like this: $(document).trigger('_page_ready')
[08:12:21] <lordjancso> thats for the first page load
[08:12:30] <DirtyFinn> if it works for you, it's good
[08:12:42] <lordjancso> and in pjax ajax complete event i just re-throw this event
[08:12:43] <DirtyFinn> nice
[08:12:44] <lordjancso> $(document).trigger('_page_ready')
[08:12:49] <lordjancso> and it works fine
[08:12:55] <DirtyFinn> good
[08:12:55] <lordjancso> i'm still testing but looks ok
[08:13:30] <lordjancso> with this i dont need to wrap everything into an ugly big function
[08:13:40] <lordjancso> i just moved my logic from an event to an other
[08:28:19] <lacrymology> http://pack-the-knives-blog.whitehippos.com/ if you look at that with a width <= 767px there's a header that says the name of the site that disappears when you open the menu. That's all very well, except when you're scrolled down, the header is not in view anymore and when you open the menu the content scrolls up (adapting to the disappearing menu). What would you recommend here?
[08:28:45] <lacrymology> this is implemented with an .animate({height: "toggle", opacity: "toggle"})
[08:30:46] <DirtyFinn> i have no idea

[10:12:44] <Uhkis> split
[10:13:52] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:14:04] <hellyeah> actually i dont want to split array
[10:14:13] <hellyeah> i want to remove characters after ":"
[10:14:19] <hellyeah> still split do the job
[10:14:21] <hellyeah> ?
[10:16:23] <hellyeah> if my question doesnt make sense sorry
[10:17:08] <hellyeah> i want to remove character after : with :
[10:17:19] <dimi1947> I have two input checkboxes and by clicking a button I want to get the value of the one(s) that is/are checked...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/yrpwf1so/
[10:18:32] <hellyeah> dimi1947: do you know how to "each"
[10:18:52] <dimi1947> hellyeah...I cannot recall
[10:19:25] <hellyeah> first you need to each your input box there are two
[10:19:31] <hellyeah> check this out http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[10:23:06] <dimi1947> hellyeah...I will look into it
[10:23:16] <hellyeah> what can be the state of input box
[10:23:21] <hellyeah> check or unchecked right
[10:23:37] <hellyeah> so there must be a way for checking the state input box
[10:23:54] <hellyeah> basically you iterate your input box and check if it is unchecked
[10:24:20] <hellyeah> you need each, if , and how to check the state of input box "check or unchecked"
[10:26:04] <blinky_> Hi guys, I have an array of 3-4 numbers between 0 and 2.  I need to check the array for duplicates of either 1 or 2.  could someone please point me in the best direction for this please.
[10:26:47] <hellyeah> you can filter your array
[10:27:32] <hellyeah> filter will iterate the array and move it into another object
[10:27:43] <hellyeah> you can check for duplication there
[10:27:52] <hellyeah> i am not expert but tthat kind of thing
[10:27:56] <blinky_> Cool cheers.
[10:33:44] <taplar> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/yrpwf1so/6/
[10:36:32] <dimi1947> taplar...the result of your code is that along with the values I seek I get also some other data that I do not need...the goal gere is get the string values and nothing else
[10:36:45] <taplar> one sec
[10:37:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/yrpwf1so/8/
[10:37:22] <taplar> just have to do a get() off of it to get that
[10:41:39] <dimi1947> taplar....yes that is what I meant
[11:19:29] <bancika> hi, I have a $('[id^="edit-commerce-shipping-recalculate"]').trigger('click') which I think triggers a click on a button making some ajax stuff. How can I execute some jquery after the ajax is done its work?
[11:30:18] <skyFlix> @bancika is there a callback on "some ajax stuff" available?
[11:39:53] <bancika> skyFlix, thanks I will try to add one
[11:41:57] <dimi1947> is it possible to use each inside html() so that you can print the contents of an array/object in a div?
[11:44:24] <taplar> what exactly are you trying to put in the div?
[11:47:16] <dimi1947> taplar line 8 https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/4fwkc25v/4/
[11:47:54] <taplar> ah, use map
[11:48:14] <taplar> and you may have to join it
[11:48:18] <dimi1947> taplar map is already used
[11:48:44] <taplar> each() doesn't return, it only iterates
[11:48:49] <taplar> if you want to iterate and return, that is map
[11:49:23] <dimi1947> I wantto print services inside fill
[11:49:38] <dimi1947> that is div fill
[11:50:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4fwkc25v/5/
[11:51:31] <dimi1947> taplar....hmmm..it was so simple after all
[11:51:33] <dimi1947> thanks
[11:52:26] <dimi1947> taplar and you are saying that this could not be done with each???
[11:52:50] <taplar> no, as i said each does not return a value.  it only iterates
[11:52:58] <taplar> it's like a for loop
[11:53:23] <taplar> map, is like each, but it returns all the values
[11:53:34] <taplar> it's a translator
[11:54:09] <taplar> different tools for different problems, :)
[11:54:54] <dimi1947> studying each http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ made me think that I could also print to the browser
[11:55:05] <taplar> it can, if done inside the each
[11:55:22] <taplar> or you could add all the results to an array and afterwards put the array to the browser

[11:58:17] <GrundeLL> Yep
[11:58:30] <taplar> that seems like more of a backend redirect question
[12:00:41] <taplar> unless i'm misunderstanding the quesiton
[12:01:25] <GrundeLL> taplar: So simply the idea is that i have a form of two silders (http://imgur.com/2ON3sMQ) and i want to redirect to different pages depending on the input, first i want it to know if its above or below 25000 and have different pages there then i want to send the amount / maturity in the url ?amount={amount}&maturtiy{maturtiy}
[12:01:53] <GrundeLL> taplar: and the "jämför >" button sends is the "link"
[12:01:58] <GrundeLL> or trigger for thios
[12:02:21] <taplar> ok, so you want to update the link when the values change?
[12:04:00] <GrundeLL> Exactly
[12:04:09] <GrundeLL> depending on two variables
[12:04:49] <taplar> ok, so you could attach an event handler to the two fields using 'change, keyup' and evaluate in there whatever needs evaluation and if it's good, update the href of the link
[12:05:37] <taplar> comma may not be needed iirc
[12:05:58] <duch_kazatel> comma shouldn't be used actually.
[12:06:02] <duch_kazatel> space separated list.
[12:06:10] <taplar> i confuse selectors with bindings
[12:06:28] <duch_kazatel> it'll see "change, keyup" as "change," and "keyup" :)
[12:09:11] <GrundeLL> taplar: okay and how do i go about that ?
[12:12:07] <GrundeLL> taplar: so this is the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/y46avqva/
[12:12:20] <GrundeLL> for some reason i cant intergrate jqueryUi...
[12:14:05] <duch_kazatel> you've got a syntax error in there.
[12:14:18] <GrundeLL> where +
[12:14:25] <duch_kazatel> $("#months").val($("#month-slide")
[12:14:31] <duch_kazatel> then the next line.
[12:15:19] <GrundeLL>  duch_kazatel:you mean line 32 ?
[12:15:27] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[12:15:30] <duch_kazatel> and 33.
[12:15:32] <duch_kazatel> that's all wring.
[12:15:34] <duch_kazatel> *wrong.
[12:15:49] <duch_kazatel> same with lines 16 and 17.
[12:16:06] <duch_kazatel> what are those trying to do?
[12:16:21] <duch_kazatel> $(".amount").val($("#slider").slider('value'));?
[12:17:11] <duch_kazatel> ah, nevermind.  i see what you're trying to do.
[12:17:20] <GrundeLL> Update the input field to correspond with slider and vice versa
[12:17:34] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y46avqva/1/
[12:17:46] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i was way lost with the way you'd indented things.
[12:18:03] <GrundeLL> My bad :/¨
[12:18:07] <duch_kazatel> it's all good.
[12:19:35] <GrundeLL> duch_kazatel: (is there a reason why i cant see the sliders? )
[12:19:48] <duch_kazatel> in that fiddle?  you're missing variable declarations.
[12:20:18] <duch_kazatel> values and sliderUpdated aren't defined, for instance.
[12:21:10] <GrundeLL> https://jsfiddle.net/y46avqva/5/
[12:21:21] <GrundeLL> there it is with the sliderUpdated
[12:21:35] <duch_kazatel> so i named two variables that aren't declared.
[12:21:39] <duch_kazatel> you did one ;)
[12:21:58] <duch_kazatel> if you open your dev tools, you'll see the error.
[12:24:06] <GrundeLL> https://jsfiddle.net/mc0t45sq/
[12:24:19] <GrundeLL> Thats the full code for it
[12:24:28] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:24:35] <duch_kazatel> just define values duder.
[12:24:43] <taplar> and check your console
[12:24:51] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^^
[12:25:59] <GrundeLL> duch_kazatel: values = amm; Line 34
[12:26:06] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:26:09] <duch_kazatel> you're missing my point.
[12:26:15] <duch_kazatel> we're trying to help you fix this :)
[12:26:27] <duch_kazatel> give us the bare minimum mano.
[12:26:47] <GrundeLL> duch_kazatel: Yeah and i do appreciate that, but i don't understand what you need me to do...
[12:27:27] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y46avqva/6/
[12:27:44] <duch_kazatel> i told you a particular variable wasn't defined, so define it.
[12:27:47] <duch_kazatel> that's all i needed you do it :)
[12:28:41] <GrundeLL> Okay, so that one defined (Thaught i could look in the url for it and if it didn't exist i defined it through amm )
[12:29:00] <duch_kazatel> your code looks like it's grabbing it from the URL.
[12:29:08] <duch_kazatel> i'd make sure that's coming back as a number in tht case.
[12:29:21] <GrundeLL> Okay.
[12:29:32] <duch_kazatel> it could very likely exist on your apge - there's no way for me to know if any of that works correctly out of context.
[12:29:38] <duch_kazatel> your dev tools are invaluable.
[12:29:53] <GrundeLL> Okay :)
[12:30:32] <GrundeLL> So to my main problem then, how do i create a link out of jämför? that is depending / sending the values in the url?
[12:31:17] <duch_kazatel> so you want to update that URL?
[12:31:27] <duch_kazatel> use .prop('href', newVarHere);
[12:31:58] <GrundeLL> What i want to achive is simply if{amount < 25000 send to site.dev/smalan} else {send to site.dev/forbrukslan} and then i want to pass the amount &/ maturity in the Url
[12:32:18] <duch_kazatel> right.  so you'd use .prop() to edit the href property.
[12:33:38] <duch_kazatel> are you confused about how to concatenate a string?  not sure what you're asking at this point :)
[12:34:07] <GrundeLL> okay. and i simply do a $('#amount).change(function{})?
[12:34:42] <taplar> are you allowing the users to do the slider and change the input box?
[12:34:50] <GrundeLL> yes
[12:35:01] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/ - you'd use one of the events listed there.  change is probably what you want.
[12:35:03] <GrundeLL> and the slider change together with the input
[12:35:23] <duch_kazatel> i'd use .on() for that, but yeah.
[12:40:17] <GrundeLL> duch_kazatel: oaky
[12:46:59] <duch_kazatel> i love oaky wine.
[12:47:01] <duch_kazatel> boom.
[12:50:30] <taplar> shaka laka laka
[13:07:49] <tfitts> is there a function in jquery that gives you the pending requests/urls that correspond to the number you get form $.active
[13:20:47] <GrundeLL> Right, so run in to a small problem, https://jsfiddle.net/y46avqva/8/ When i update the amount / months in the correct order it works but when i add the maturity afterwars something goes wrong...
[13:25:44] <taplar> you could keep the maturity as a variable and use it in the other setter
[13:26:07] <taplar> or look it up from the input
[13:26:54] <GrundeLL> Okay,
[13:33:45] <GrundeLL> sweet i think i made it ;) https://jsfiddle.net/y46avqva/9/
[13:35:59] <taplar> one thing you might consider doing is caching your amount and month lookups
[13:36:11] <taplar> since your doing those multiple times
[13:37:07] <BoomBox1> Hey there! I just wanted to understand how I can apply a parallax similar to this: where a person appears to fly? An example would be handy thanks
[13:37:28] <BoomBox1> I tried to use parallax.min.js but it does not work quite right. I am new to this
[13:37:41] <BoomBox1> I can quickly show you what I did
[14:14:21] <hellyeah> taplar: can i show you my last effort?
[14:15:13] <taplar> sure
[14:16:55] <hellyeah> taplar: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xZWKzO
[14:29:51] <hellyeah> taplar: any feeback?
[14:31:49] <taplar> can't look at it right now.  got stuff to fix
[14:32:12] <hellyeah> oh sure
[14:32:15] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[14:32:31] <hellyeah> if you can check later pls let me know
[14:32:32] <taplar> you didn't break it, :P
[14:33:47] <hellyeah> you didnt break it i dont quiet understand the sentence can you meantion in different way :p
[14:34:20] <taplar> you didn't cause the issue that i'm having to resolve.  so no need to be sorry
[14:34:48] <hellyeah> ah okey
[14:34:55] <hellyeah> hmm i understand now
[15:28:55] <jquery634> I have this code, but when I try to get the value of the dom item in the IsJobValid() it is empty. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8487aebc4c4e840a2f19
[15:30:54] <jquery634> ??
[15:35:36] <jquery634> is this the wrong chanell?
[15:37:15] <PilotBob> Hi folks?
[15:43:23] <Pilotbob> so is there something wrong with this chanell?
[15:50:24] <Dulcin> Hi, I'm trying to find a javascript/jquery form widget that allows the user to create a list by adding/removing list items and change the order those list items. I tried Googling, but so far haven't been able to think of the right keywords to look for
[15:50:48] <Dulcin> Anyone know any widget that does this?
[15:51:49] <Dulcin> And I'm talking about a custom list, so there's no options to choose from, simply an input field with an add button, and the option to remove it and order it
[15:55:02] <Anorak> anyone live?
[15:55:18] <Pilotbob> hello, this chanel seems unnormally dead.
[15:55:29] <Anorak> i am looking into learning to make a modal in jquery core but i need some directions
[15:55:37] <Anorak> fuck bob
[15:55:45] <Pilotbob> huh?
[15:56:02] <Anorak> what should i do now?
[15:56:15] <Anorak> it is alot of people to just keep quiet on me
[15:57:14] <Pilotbob> like I said, this chanel is abnormally queit
[15:57:34] <Pilotbob> jqueryUI has a model dialog implementation
[15:58:36] <ccmonster_> i have a selector which is triggering a click event even though the selected element is disabled
[15:58:43] <Anorak> i was thinking of avoiding another JS call but it seems i can't avoid it
[15:58:46] <ccmonster_> any gotchyas with this?
[16:00:02] <Pilotbob> Why would a selector trigger a click? That doesn't seem right.
[16:00:37] <ccmonster_> i have an <a> which is diabled, and i'm still getting a click event firing
[16:00:43] <ccmonster_> disabled*
[16:01:00] <Anorak> you disabled it wrong?
[16:01:15] <ccmonster_> perhaps lol
[16:01:20] <Pilotbob> are you sure it's the a sending the event. Click events bubble.
[16:02:20] <ccmonster_> hm, perhaps a e.stopPropagation is needed.
[16:03:33] <ccmonster_> i did a disabled, true on it
[16:03:51] <ccmonster_> and i can see the el with disabled="disabled"
[16:04:21] <Pilotbob> do you have a jsfiddle that shows the behavior?
[16:09:32] <Pilotbob> so, who understands the ajax promise behavior. It is calling then before it calls success. wth?
[16:09:45] <duch_kazatel> success it not apart of promises.
[16:09:47] <duch_kazatel> .done() is.
[16:10:02] <ccmonster_> what is success then?
[16:10:06] <ccmonster_> defferred?
[16:10:14] <duch_kazatel> promises and deferreds are related to each other.
[16:10:22] <duch_kazatel> deferreds are the object that implement the promise interface.
[16:10:26] <ccmonster_> got ya
[16:10:31] <duch_kazatel> success is the old way of registering callbacks.
[16:10:43] <duch_kazatel> don't usee success/error if you're using promises, otherwise you get weird behavior like the above.
[16:10:52] <ccmonster_> what's suggested then?
[16:10:58] <duch_kazatel> deferreds.
[16:11:00] <duch_kazatel> use .then().
[16:11:13] <duch_kazatel> or done/fail if you want.
[16:11:52] <ccmonster_> got a link to a good writeup of using the .then() the right way?
[16:12:24] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ is pretty good.
[16:12:32] <ccmonster_> sounds good.
[16:12:37] <ccmonster_> ty
[16:12:52] <duch_kazatel> specifically api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jqXHR
[16:13:33] <duch_kazatel> if you scroll down a bit, you'll see api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#callback-functions, which shows you why success runs before the promise callbacks.
[16:13:59] <Uhkis> how does one use it the wrong way?
[16:14:17] <duch_kazatel> by using success and .then() together ;)
[16:14:26] <ccmonster_> lol
[16:46:36] <django_> hey all i have html: https://jsfiddle.net/shqtm5x2/ i wanna capture the send/logout
[16:46:58] <django_> but if i do on.("submit"..) it captures any submit
[16:47:01] <django_> what is a good way of doing it?
[16:47:33] <arc_> django_ assign an id to the button and select it for your binding
[16:50:07] <BoomBox1> Hey guys anyone to help with squarespace issue? I am not able to get a simple parallax scroll effect
[16:50:47] <BoomBox1> It works fine on a local implementation but due to the template I am not able to figure out exactly which div to pic for it to work
[17:12:42] <jak2000> any jquery claendar plugin ? any recomendattion?
[17:20:47] <alluringme> Hi how would i append a div around the <figure> : http://pastebin.com/pp7vz9Qh
[17:22:01] <taplar> you want to make figure a child of a new element?
[17:22:36] <alluringme> Yes, that's right taplar thank you
[17:22:42] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[17:23:58] <alluringme> I am checking it thanks. I see I can do it with a class, hope it works with id ; I will read the doc and brb :)
[17:24:12] <taplar> sure, any selector will work
[17:24:29] <alluringme> Okay let me try to see if it does the trick. :D
[17:30:09] <ponpanderer> Hello
[17:30:21] <taplar> yo
[17:32:35] <alluringme> I am guessing this is correct, this does not work for some reason: $(document).ready(function(){
[17:32:35] <alluringme> $('#thumbnail').wrap( "<div id='topDiv'></div>" );
[17:32:35] <alluringme> });
[17:32:47] <ponpanderer> I seem to be running into an issue with tooltips being orphaned on screen during fast transitions (mouseover several items in a menu). is there any way to add some kind of hover intent delay?
[17:34:26] <taplar> alluringme: looks fine.  can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[17:35:32] <alluringme> I mean, its a live site and I see that has been loaded in the head.... its square space I am not sure how I can replicate ; let me try copying a part of it sec.
[17:35:33] <alluringme> thanks
[17:39:21] <alluringme> strangly it works on fiddle :/ https://jsfiddle.net/wcprpfwa/
[17:40:14] <taplar> your sticking this stuff in your <head> ?
[17:40:39] <alluringme> thats right
[17:40:51] <alluringme> should I move it to the footer and try?
[17:40:53] <taplar> all of that should be in your doc ready then, as your doing a dom lookup
[17:41:41] <alluringme> Okay thank you taplar, let me try that;
[17:42:19] <taplar> do you understand the issue you would have with that?
[17:46:14] <alluringme> I understand your point. I was just wondering , lets say it must atleast wrap a div for me to begin with?
[17:46:52] <alluringme> I mean JQ is loaded, dom is ready, thus technically it should wrap a div is what I understand.
[17:47:06] <alluringme> The scroll part I moved to footer.
[17:47:10] <taplar> outside of the ready, in the header, the dom is not ready
[17:47:46] <alluringme> Hmm, but, it can manipulate and add elements?
[17:48:15] <alluringme> Please correct me if I am missing something haha, a little messed up today
[17:48:44] <alluringme> assuming #thumbnail is already there
[17:48:48] <taplar> you might could outside of a ready, though that would be weird.  appending to something that hasn't been parsed into the dom yet.  you really want it in a ready so it delays for the document to be completely loaded into the dom
[17:49:29] <alluringme> Okay, I understand. So you suggest me to move that bit to footer too and then try?
[17:49:49] <alluringme> I was confused as it worked on the fiddle
[17:50:19] <taplar> it's up to you.  if you keep it in the header, anything that relies on dom lookups should be in a ready.  if you put it at the bottom of your page, before </body> the ready is unnecessary
[17:51:37] <taplar> but either way, i'd keep it all together instead of spreading it out where you have to find stuff later
[17:51:40] <alluringme> okay, thanks for clearing that, I will move it to the bottom and see if that helps :)
[17:52:22] <alluringme> I am not a avid developer thus I keep having those silly doubts.
[17:52:47] <taplar> it's fine
[17:53:08] <taplar> even if you get confidence through repetition, doesn't mean we're always correct, :)
[17:54:00] <alluringme> Hehe, yeah, learning never ends :D Devs role is hard to cope up all the time.
[17:54:23] <taplar> so long as it's fun/interesting ;)
[17:54:49] <taplar> "working" sux
[17:55:20] <alluringme> That is true :) Today is utter waste, i am working on a fixed price project for 24$ from 4 hours lol
[17:56:16] <taplar> can imagine
[17:57:13] <alluringme> :D Now Team Viewer session ended lol; I will try it later. Thanks for your help taplar ; have a good day.
[17:57:23] <taplar> u2
[17:57:48] <alluringme> Thank you, later.
[18:21:04] * taplar is out
[18:33:03] <troop> hi..i am saving some data with ajax when user is checked or unchecked checkbox then manipulating html dom with returning data after this operation user clicks and go next page..
[18:33:29] <troop> after this, if user click back button of browser, manipulated data has reset
[18:33:37] <troop> how can i prevent this?
[18:34:02] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to detect if the user went "back" and, if so, pull your ajax back in from the server.
[18:35:11] <troop> duch_kazatel, but there is a problem too ( sorry i am not front end designer i dont understand much of front end) if user click to back button, checkbox seen still checked
[18:35:20] <troop> but data has reset
[18:35:50] <duch_kazatel> right, so you need to detect if the page was hit as the result of the user pressing the back button and, if that has happened, update the page as necessary.
[18:36:43] <troop> okay i will search for it
[18:37:09] <troop> thanks
[18:38:00] <troop> duch_kazatel,
[18:38:23] <troop> but i need to detect it in previous page ( if user came here with back button )
[18:38:25] <troop> right?
[18:38:31] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[18:38:38] <duch_kazatel> err.
[18:38:38] <troop> ok
[18:38:42] <duch_kazatel> "in previous page"?
[18:38:54] <troop> ok.. well.
[18:39:16] <troop> user enter the page, does some opereation in A page then clicks button and goes B page
[18:39:57] <troop> then clicks back button and comes A page again, so A page needs to know user came here with back button
[18:39:57] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9046184/reload-the-site-when-reached-via-browsers-back-button
[18:40:06] <duch_kazatel> lots of resources out there to solve this.
[18:42:58] <DarkElement> I am trying to scroll to anchor, instead of the quick jump that window.location.href yields. However, I am having trouble finding an example of this that doesn't involve actually triggering when someone clicks an href, anyone know?
[18:43:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:43:43] <duch_kazatel> you just run the code in the click handler.
[18:43:43] <DarkElement> Do you understand what I am trying to do?
[18:43:53] <DarkElement> But there is no click involved
[18:43:59] <duch_kazatel> right, so you just run the code.
[18:44:04] <duch_kazatel> instead of putting it in an event handler.
[18:44:22] <DarkElement> I tried that...i'll take a second look, however.
[18:44:35] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue you're having?
[18:44:40] <duch_kazatel> it jumped straight to the element?
[18:45:07] <duch_kazatel> because you're probably going to have to prevent the scroll or make it easy on yourself and use a different hash value to get to that ID.
[18:45:28] <DarkElement> It is not jumping when I do the stuff in the response to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717527/jquery-smooth-scrolling-when-clicking-an-anchor-link
[18:45:44] <duch_kazatel> can you share an example of your code then?
[18:46:38] <DarkElement> http://paste.pound-python.org/show/vgvVZcKLJnWJ7CNsWE6n/
[18:48:14] <DarkElement> And nothing happens when I execute this
[18:48:38] <duch_kazatel> you might want $(window)?
[18:48:56] <DarkElement> isntead of window.location, $(window)?
[18:49:04] <duch_kazatel> instead of $('html, body')
[18:49:13] <DarkElement> sec
[18:49:22] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[18:50:08] <DarkElement> Alright, that moved it, however it didn't move until after a delay, and also moved instantly, instead of scrolling.
[18:51:12] <DarkElement> What now duch_kazatel
[18:51:53] <duch_kazatel> make a jsfiddle.
[18:51:58] <duch_kazatel> i can't divine your html and stuff.
[18:55:59] <DarkElement> duch_kazatel, this should be good example: https://jsfiddle.net/jy0L4sLv/
[18:56:22] <DarkElement> Except jsfiddle doesn't seem to jump to anchor tags, since it's jsfiddle.
[18:56:33] <duch_kazatel> err.
[18:56:39] <duch_kazatel> don't use onclick.
[18:57:02] <DarkElement> That's not the problem but why
[18:58:23] <duch_kazatel> actually in the fiddle it IS the problem :)
[18:58:29] <duch_kazatel> doesn't see the function declaration.
[18:58:35] <duch_kazatel> plus you want all of your logic in JS, not js AND html.

[18:59:15] <duch_kazatel> works fine.
[18:59:25] <duch_kazatel> just need to make the content tall enough to enable a scroll.
[19:00:15] <DarkElement> So it wasn't the onclick that was the problem, just that they weren't far enough apart?
[19:00:24] <duch_kazatel> i don't know about your page.
[19:00:28] <duch_kazatel> but onclick is still gross.
[19:00:31] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[19:00:42] <DarkElement> Yea I just found the unobtrusive js page on wikipedia
[19:01:06] <DarkElement> But I don't think this is a solution to my problem, since on the page they aren't that far apart
[19:01:13] <DarkElement> I need it to scroll regardless
[19:01:14] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[19:01:22] <duch_kazatel> do you see errors in there when you click/the page loads?
[19:01:59] <DarkElement> No, I already checked.
[19:02:10] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, not enough space.
[19:02:19] <DarkElement> ...
[19:02:30] <duch_kazatel> need to give the element enough contents to scroll.
[19:02:30] <DarkElement> Why the hell is that a thing
[19:02:42] <DarkElement> Why will it not scroll
[19:02:44] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise the browser window would scroll forever for no reason.
[19:02:47] <DarkElement> Why does it say nah just scroll yourself
[19:02:52] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:02:56] <duch_kazatel> you can't scroll youself either.
[19:03:00] <DarkElement> They are like 200px away
[19:03:02] <duch_kazatel> can you scroll using your mouse?
[19:03:12] <DarkElement> I want to scroll so that the user can easily go through the form
[19:03:26] <DarkElement> But it won't go if the distance is too small?
[19:03:27] <duch_kazatel> ...
[19:03:38] <duch_kazatel> there's nowhere for it to scroll dude.
[19:03:39] <duch_kazatel> *duder
[19:03:47] <DarkElement> On my main page there is
[19:03:59] <duch_kazatel> is has nothing to do with the distance between the elements and everything to do with there being enough space for things to scroll./
[19:04:00] <duch_kazatel> that's what i mean.
[19:04:14] <duch_kazatel> i can't see the page so it's hard for me to help.
[19:04:20] <DarkElement> There is enough space on my page, I didn't realize that in my jsfiddle but there is enough space in my actual page.
[19:04:24] <duch_kazatel> try popping a console log in the handler and making sure it's even running.
[19:05:19] <DarkElement> How do i open a log inside a handler?
[19:05:34] <duch_kazatel> you open your console and use console.log() to output to it.
[19:05:46] <DarkElement> oh, didn't think you meant that
[19:06:21] <DarkElement> I know it is running because it is moving the page down
[19:07:31] <duch_kazatel> that's the default functionality.
[19:07:36] <duch_kazatel> is the handler even running?
[19:07:46] <duch_kazatel> if you put a console.log() in there can you see it fire?
[19:10:43] <DarkElement> duch_kazatel, when I add a console.log right before the window.location line it triggers the log but not the redirect
[19:11:03] <DarkElement> Only when I add it after does it work, which is strange.
[19:11:11] <DarkElement> But yes, i can see it fire.
[19:11:36] <duch_kazatel> are these anchor tags?
[19:11:38] <duch_kazatel> or divs?
[19:11:46] <DarkElement> These are <div id="something">
[19:11:50] <DarkElement> each one is like that
[19:11:59] <duch_kazatel> then i dunno. i'd have to see it.
[19:12:14] <DarkElement> fakkk
[19:12:27] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jy0L4sLv/2/
[19:12:29] <DarkElement> Gimme a sec
[19:12:34] <duch_kazatel> maybe try uising var $root = $('html, body'); again
[19:12:36] <DarkElement> I can actually just upload it
[19:12:39] <DarkElement> ok
[19:13:22] <DarkElement> When I changed it to that, it logged the test thing twice and didn't move.
[19:13:30] <DarkElement> I am uploading the file and will send you a url
[19:17:33] <duch_kazatel> hey could you toss that to the channel instead of a PM?
[19:17:45] <duch_kazatel> 'cause i might not be able to help you
[19:17:47] <duch_kazatel> ;)

[19:19:37] <duch_kazatel> are you creating these elements and then trying to scroll to them?
[19:19:53] <duch_kazatel> because i think I know exactly what your problem is :)
[19:20:20] <duch_kazatel> click a few of those buttons, then go back and try clicking on them again.
[19:20:20] <DarkElement> Oh no
[19:20:21] <DarkElement> Oh god
[19:20:26] <DarkElement> notlikethis
[19:20:35] <duch_kazatel> another reason you don't want to use onclick.
[19:20:40] <taplar> o_O
[19:20:41] <duch_kazatel> stick things inside a single event handler.
[19:20:44] <duch_kazatel> keeps things cleaner.
[19:21:54] <DarkElement> While I agree with you on changing onclick, the problem was not that, but merely my own ignorance
[19:22:19] <DarkElement> When you find the source of the problem and just laugh
[19:22:23] <DarkElement> god dammit
[19:23:18] <DarkElement> I am going to clean up that obtrusive js, and make sure to seperate my functionality.
[19:23:24] <DarkElement> Thank you so much duch_kazatel
[19:55:11] <troop> is it possible send user to the given link when user clicked to the back button?
[20:44:28] <ayylmao> does anyone here know about datatables dot net?
