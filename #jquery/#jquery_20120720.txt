[00:00:46] <sente> speaking of pics
[00:00:50] <Lucky--> explanation: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/493327/Tree%20mechanics.jpg
[00:01:02] <sente> i crawled 3,000,000 imgur pics to do site analytics
[00:01:04] <sente> on them
[00:01:11] <sente> i should publish my findings
[00:01:23] <Lucky--> i'm gonna roll out a hadoop cluster on azure when I get some time
[00:01:39] <mindis|wurk> argh, a chart. *implodes*
[00:01:42] <Lucky--> and use it to generate trading signals, shit like weather feeds, mortgage data, sentiment indicators, etc
[00:02:05] <Lucky--> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/493327/program.jpg
[00:02:06] <jaffipaffi> Hi guys... I try to fetch route directions from Google Maps API with JSON and using this: $.getJSON('http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin='+$('#latitude').val()+','+$('#longitude').val()+'&waypoints='+loc+'&sensor=false&callback=?', function(data) { console.log(data); });, but I get this: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[00:02:10] <Lucky--> hadooponazure.com
[00:02:13] <jaffipaffi> As it wasn't parsed as json :S
[00:02:18] <jaffipaffi> any ideas on what I can do?
[00:02:51] <sente> Lucky--: you a .net guy?
[00:03:21] <Lucky--> yea
[00:03:43] <sente> do you like that?
[00:03:51] <Lucky--> im not even a fuckin dev, but too many people were incompetent around me, so I ended up just doing it myself, and actually yea, love it
[00:04:01] <Lucky--> i used to do shit in PHP. i shudder now
[00:04:22] <Lucky--> to even think about it, i would never event accept any php work ever again just farm it off to elancwe
[00:04:31] <Lucky--> I actually enjoy it
[00:04:43] <sente> i see
[00:04:53] <Lucky--> and when you start exploring where they are taking it with web services, and simplifying things
[00:04:55] <Lucky--> its crazy
[00:05:35] <mindis|wurk> what did you hate the most about php?
[00:05:42] <sente> mindis|wurk: what's not to hate?
[00:06:01] <Lucky--> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/493327/infrastructure.jpg
[00:06:21] <Lucky--> i seriously think I could pull off more with writing bqatch files
[00:06:22] <mindis|wurk> i've never had a problem with php except for the poorly name functions
[00:06:25] <Lucky--> and do it mnore efficiently
[00:06:40] <Lucky--> mindis|wurk: most people in the PHP world have no clue what an orm even is
[00:06:42] <sente> mindis|wurk: and its lack of OOP
[00:06:44] <Lucky--> ^
[00:06:45] <sente> and its lack of a REPL
[00:06:54] <sente> and it's lack of debugging
[00:07:04] <mindis|wurk> Lucky-- you're right, i have no idea either
[00:07:04] <Lucky--> half your time is spent writing CRUD code
[00:07:05] <sente> and it's lack of package management
[00:07:19] <Lucky--> (create read update delete)
[00:07:29] <mindis|wurk> sente i use OOP daily. you must be referring to something specific
[00:07:40] <Lucky--> in .net, I can LITERALLY drag a db table onto my surface
[00:07:42] <Lucky--> writing 0 code for it
[00:08:03] <Lucky--> and have my classes;/models/objects auto persistence tracked
[00:08:06] <Lucky--> and updating the db etc
[00:08:10] <sente> yeah
[00:08:15] <sente> python > *
[00:08:23] <sente> says sente the asshole
[00:08:35] <Lucky--> basically I can do 10x as much work in 10 x less time
[00:08:41] <Lucky--> and it aactually looks decent
[00:08:51] <sente> spekaing of python
[00:08:54] <sente> i have to do work
[00:08:57] <sente> bbiab
[00:09:33] <juha_> sente: yeah the search sucks a bit
[00:09:41] <Lucky--> sente
[00:09:44] <sente> juha_: yeah, just a bit? ;)
[00:09:45] <Lucky--> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/493327/majesticseo_backlinks_history_backlinks.png ugh
[00:10:12] <sente> heh
[00:10:13] <Lucky--> i dont want to call $(selectors._selector).myinput :-(
[00:10:18] <mindis|wurk> bah. wanted to make a clever highlighting system but z-index and opacity colliding aren't making this easy
[00:10:19] <Lucky--> the idea was to get rid of the damn $
[00:10:24] <fairuz> Hey sente :)
[00:10:43] <sente> god i hate SEO
[00:10:49] <sente> Lucky--, you're good in my book
[00:10:52] <sente> my socal pal
[00:10:55] <sente> but SEO...shudder
[00:11:00] <juha_> sente: it works nicely when used from the top search bar, but when you go to the search page it sucks
[00:11:02] <sente> word, fairuz
[00:11:13] <Lucky--> sente ya man
[00:11:17] <juha_> sente: i didn't remember to finalize the search page :D
[00:11:18] <Lucky--> why do you think i sold that company
[00:11:22] <Lucky--> it was profitable too
[00:11:29] <Lucky--> just not mentally profitable
[00:11:42] <coldhead> can everyone please kill me
[00:11:44] <Lucky--> i will never do a service based business again till the day i die
[00:11:48] <fairuz> I have some "tricks" to do cheap advertising on Google ads.
[00:11:54] <Lucky--> they just arent scalable
[00:11:58] <mindis|wurk> you sure are an ambitious guy
[00:12:40] <Lucky--> meh, chalk it up to all the kids backc growing up that fucked with me, and i basically told them I would fucking own them :-)
[00:13:06] <Lucky--> and their parents
[00:13:22] <sacho> ..speaking of jquery
[00:13:56] <sente> i have tricks to donwload the internet
[00:14:03] <sente> that's my specialty
[00:15:31] <sente> juha_: doesn't make much sense that searches are different
[00:15:34] <sente> the url is the same
[00:15:38] <sente> i see why, in the code
[00:15:40] <sente> but odd
[00:16:59] <juha_> sente: yeah, it's not finished
[00:19:30] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[00:19:39] <Double_Rainbow> how do i refresh a div every 1 seconds ?
[00:19:50] <juha_> setInterval
[00:20:08] <mindis|wurk> how i hate how poor css is with scaling content to fit a space automatically
[00:20:26] <Lucky|Laptop> mindis|wurk: wtb responsive imaging already
[00:20:41] <diverdude> what is the jquery equivalent to PHP's empty()? Checks both if the variable exists, if it is not null and if it is an array, if it is not empty ?
[00:21:05] <mindis|wurk> feels like you have to do everything with table equivalents :/
[00:21:30] <Lucky|Laptop> prototype pattern is like a static class right?
[00:21:50] <Lucky|Laptop> mindis|wurk: use the twitter bootstrap yet with the fluid grid?
[00:21:59] <sente> juha_: do you notice server activiity?
[00:22:14] <sente> like, current searches, etc
[00:22:35] <mindis|wurk> Lucky|Laptop i have no idea what you're talking about :D
[00:22:50] <juha_> sente: not logging searches at the moment
[00:22:59] <sente> juha_: gotcha
[00:23:04] <juha_> hmm
[00:23:10] <juha_> my traffic just completely died
[00:23:27] <sente> seems good on my end
[00:23:41] <juha_> analytics just dropped to zero
[00:23:52] <juha_> usually always 100+ people on the site
[00:24:15] <Lucky--> juha_: what demographic is the audience?
[00:24:53] <diverdude> what is the jquery equivalent to PHP's empty()? Checks both if the variable exists, if it is not null and if it is an array, if it is not empty ?
[00:25:25] <juha_> Lucky--: about 90% from us
[00:25:42] <sacho> diverdude, if(var)
[00:26:46] <Lucky--> juha_ whats the demographic of the pplo onjt he site
[00:26:51] <Lucky--> income/education wise
[00:27:44] <juha_> i don't know
[00:28:02] <sacho> diverdude, actually, not exactly true, there isn't a strict equivalent
[00:28:25] <Lucky--> 20 apps a day is about $500/day from us
[00:30:14] <diverdude> sacho: ok...im just looking for a more shorthand way of writing the following basically: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/415618793
[00:31:25] <Cristen> Hey everyone, I tried to code a small chat using a timer it sets a message on every second. I used animate to scroll down the div once a message is posted. But how to prevent the scrolling when the user clicks on the scrollbar ?( to go back top for example)
[00:31:43] <rahul2kumar> HI ALL
[00:32:45] <sacho> it's odd that you need to check your variables for whether they were initialized or not, but...
[00:32:47] <sente> juha_: http://c.sente.cc/4vFc/first_images.json.txt
[00:33:08] <sente> whats with width?
[00:33:08] <diverdude> sacho: why is that odd?
[00:33:20] <sacho> because you should be aware of whether they were initialized or not? :|
[00:33:28] <juha_> sente: hack, not all images have width on db
[00:33:35] <ryanaz> yo.
[00:33:38] <sente> and also, will 'search=' find all the images
[00:33:46] <juha_> apparently non
[00:33:51] <juha_> hahah
[00:33:53] <juha_> fuuu
[00:34:04] <sente> juha_: none of the images have width
[00:34:05] <diverdude> sacho: sure, but this is variables sent via websockets from other clients. i dont know what they will send me
[00:34:19] <juha_> sente: maybe i broke something yesterday
[00:34:22] <sente> juha_: meh
[00:34:28] <juha_> i was doing some performance maintenance etc
[00:34:37] <rahul2kumar> please look into this http://pastebin.com/bRjrQNc4
[00:34:38] <sente> well if you lose it all
[00:34:40] <sente> i have a copy now
[00:34:45] <sente> ;)
[00:34:48] <sente> which, i will delete
[00:34:49] <sacho> so make sure they're initialized to something
[00:34:50] <juha_> i need to check it during the weekend, maybe it's always been broken
[00:34:52] <sente> because there is no good meta data
[00:35:03] <sacho> if you don't know what they'll send, you don't know that it'll have a function "fct" either
[00:35:29] <sacho> also, typeof x !== "undefined" && x is redundant
[00:35:34] <sacho> just x would do the same
[00:36:06] <rahul2kumar> please look into this http://pastebin.com/bRjrQNc4
[00:36:30] <sente> juha_: do you really think you can monatize that site?
[00:36:38] <ryanaz> hey systemfault
[00:36:56] <juha_> sente: i have no idea, most likely not
[00:37:10] <sente> yeah
[00:37:19] <sente> i mean, someone will click banners and ads now and then
[00:37:23] <sente> you could interleave them with images
[00:37:28] <sente> and not give a shit about ethics
[00:37:32] <sente> because ... it's an image site
[00:37:43] <sente> how often do you get uploads
[00:38:07] <juha_> every now and then
[00:38:24] <juha_> i used to have banners but adsense kicked me out and the banners were dropping pageviews..
[00:38:53] <ryanaz> !seen systemfault
[00:38:53] <b-ot> ryanaz, I saw systemfault 7h 9m ago, joining #jquery.
[00:40:54] <Christe__> Hi, does anyone of you know about any nice way of highlighting the active link/current page you are on?
[00:47:04] <Cristen> Ok guys, here's my work, http://jsfiddle.net/Se6qw/,  how do you disable automatic scrolling on mousedown and reactivate it on mouseup ? My code doesn't work if I click drag and release mousebutton, but if I click again the scrolling starts again
[00:53:22] <Lucky--> http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html <-- anyone use this before? im thinking of using it
[00:58:09] <davetarmac> Hey guys - I'm trying to use jQuery 1.5.2, jQueryUI 1.7.2 to get some tabs working - ultimately on Magento Go, but in jsFiddle for now - but it isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/5r8QP/
[00:58:46] <davetarmac> That fiddle is using the example on the jQuery page
[01:24:58] <Strausser> Hey, guys. Is it possible to limit the amount of text in a textarea OTHER than counting characters?
[01:25:27] <Strausser> as linebreak is a character, it's not really accurate :\
[01:26:28] <mindis|wurk> you could always leave out linebreak from the calculation but that's probably not the problem here
[01:26:53] <Cristen> using calculation + regex ?
[01:26:54] <Strausser> still "m" will be wider that "i"
[01:27:02] <Strausser> Hmm
[01:27:10] <Cristen> so that you can avoid unwanted characters
[01:27:59] <Strausser> Well yeah, still not very accurate tho. The absolute best solution would be if I could check if the user has passed, say; 300px in height
[01:30:33] <mindis|wurk> i've struggled with similar issues myself. the textarea is another fine example of how crude and limited form elements are
[01:30:52] <eddyb> so, my syntax highlighter was slow. guess what was taking 20 seconds? $this.html('');
[01:31:17] <Strausser> Okay, this may be harder than i thought :p
[01:31:57] <mindis|wurk> i almost burst a few blood vessels trying to center textarea text both horizontally and vertically
[01:32:00] <eddyb> I'm now questioning whether or not that's the best way to empty a container
[01:32:14] <Lucky|Laptop> documnent.ready happens before window.onload correct?
[01:32:30] <eddyb> mindis|wurk: if you can use CCS3, try flexboxes
[01:32:52] <mindis|wurk> i've used it in the past, it's...quite messy too
[01:32:53] <eddyb> mindis|wurk: they allow that with, like, three or four CSS properties
[01:33:04] <Strausser> what are flexboxes?
[01:33:21] <eddyb> it's not messy at all, at least not messier than trying to do without them
[01:33:57] <mindis|wurk> i also had compatibility issues to consider at the time
[01:33:57] <eddyb> Strausser: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/flexbox/quick/
[01:34:15] <Strausser> thx
[01:34:42] <eddyb> mindis|wurk: that's why I said "if you can use CSS3". if you support IE, either consider forcing chrome frame or just ditch that shit
[01:35:15] <mindis|wurk> hehe
[01:35:19] <Strausser> In my case, I would need to support IE8
[01:35:27] <mindis|wurk> good luck with that
[01:35:28] <Strausser> *crys*
[01:35:37] <Cristen> Strausser,
[01:35:37] <mindis|wurk> i'm so happy i don't need to consider IE at all in most of the stuff i do
[01:35:50] <Cristen> maybe if you use scrollHeight ??
[01:35:55] <Strausser> like please, just let the thing die already
[01:36:33] <Strausser> scrollheight in a textarea?
[01:36:36] <Cristen> yeah
[01:36:47] <Cristen> http://jsfiddle.net/Se6qw/
[01:36:49] <Strausser> Hmm
[01:36:53] <Cristen> add or remove text inside
[01:37:02] <Cristen> you'll see the value changing
[01:37:13] <Cristen> might be a workaround to your problem ...
[01:37:42] <eddyb> so, why does emptying a container take 20 seconds?
[01:38:32] <Strausser> Hmmmmm. So if I use overflow:hidden, it would still technically scroll right?
[01:38:34] <eddyb> it took less than a second to create what's inside the container, I doubt v8+WebKit+chrome take that much just to garbage collect
[01:39:10] <Strausser> eddyb: Are you sure its not a slow selector or something?
[01:39:12] <Cristen> Strausser, I tried on the link I provided
[01:39:13] <mathi> hi
[01:39:15] <eddyb> oooh, .empty exists
[01:39:16] <Cristen> and it works with overflow hidden
[01:39:26] <eddyb> Strausser: there's no selector:$this.html('');
[01:39:27] <mathi> is there any way to check if jquery is available ?
[01:39:37] <Strausser> ah
[01:39:47] <eddyb> mathi: typeof jQuery !== 'undefined'?
[01:40:03] <Cristen> Strausser, with overflow hidden there's no scrollbar and the value changes
[01:40:25] <bamarni> how should I deal with a string where I have to put a lot of variables, instead of "foo" + bar + "toh" + hi + "..." ? is there another solution?
[01:40:29] <Strausser> you mean the scrollHeight value, right?
[01:40:32] <Cristen> mathi http://jquery-howto.blogspot.fr/2009/03/check-if-jqueryjs-is-loaded.html
[01:40:41] <mathi> thank you!
[01:40:56] <eddyb> mathi: and that's generic, it works for any global object. you could also do ('jQuery' in window), IIRC
[01:41:00] <Cristen> Strausser, yes, but it means that the scrollbar must exist (even if it's not visible)
[01:41:31] <Strausser> For some reason I dont see it update in the DOM tree in Fire bug :S
[01:41:39] <Cristen> at a certain point of height overflow a scrollbar appears, but before that the value of scrollHeight doesn't change
[01:42:41] <Strausser> I'm not exactly sure how scrollHeight works. Is it always 0 when theres not scrolling?
[01:43:18] <Cristen> well when there's no scrollbar the value for me is 200 which is the height of my element
[01:43:18] <cynicalgrinch> anyone know why the javascript channel is invite only now?
[01:43:32] <Strausser> Ah
[01:43:43] <Cristen> but when there's a scrollbar it's 200+ the value of scrolling
[01:44:02] <Cristen> so if you make it invisible with overflow hidden it still works
[01:44:05] <Strausser> Wow cristen, that actually sound like a great idea!
[01:44:19] <Cristen> so if you add some Maths I think it could solve your problem
[01:44:26] <Strausser> Thanks man!!
[01:44:33] <Cristen> try it here
[01:44:34] <Cristen> http://jsfiddle.net/Se6qw/1/
[01:44:56] <Cristen> change the number of characters inside the textarea and rerun the script
[01:45:02] <Cristen> each time the scrollValue is different
[01:45:32] <Cristen> Strausser -> you're welcome ;)
[01:45:59] <Strausser> :D
[01:47:45] <eddyb> .empty() is a hundred times faster than .html('')
[01:47:54] <eddyb> I've been in the dark all this time :(
[01:56:12] <cynicalgrinch> I've got a social feed that's pulling from Twitter & FB and I'm getting an Uncaught TypeError when trying to pull from FB in line 52 here. Could anyone see if I'm doing anything obviously wrong? https://gist.github.com/3149679
[02:01:32] <aleminio> hey guys, what is the difference between using TOP and using PARENT in a frame in order to get the document element?
[02:03:04] <shoky> aleminio: parent gets direct parent, top gets the root ancestor
[02:06:47] <klawd_prime> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/node/5944 am i just retarded or is there no download link?

[02:19:30] <SeekingGuidance> Asked By s p in JavaScript on 20-Jul-12 04:09 AM  As per my finding till now...If we have to work with jquery then there is a site named http://jquery.org/, here we get .js latest files... now if we want we can use them with our gridview control of .net... but if the data we will be handling is too large we should consider gridview made in javascript i.e Jquery Grid   M i Correct in my findings till here?

[02:34:47] <zulu-gula> how to iterate just through firtst level child elements?
[02:37:03] <zulu-gula> I would like to add class like here:http://pastebin.com/B1CgdZLd
[02:37:07] <zulu-gula> http://pastebin.com/B1CgdZLd
[02:45:20] <bronsen> zulu-gula: maybe closest(expr) helps
[02:45:31] <bronsen> just guessing though, I have never used it myself

[03:19:06] <BrixSat> Hello, im having a problem with jquery latest, when i get data from a json  ajax request in utf8  the $.parseJSON(data); stops the execution of script
[03:21:16] <Whirl3d> slightly off-topic, but does anyone have a valid up-to-date link that demonstrates the preferred way to implment web fonts?
[03:22:31] <mindis|wurk> i'd imagine checking how google fonts does it would suffice
[03:30:52] <masak> good day. I'm relatively new at jQuery, but I thought I would build something using jQuery UI today. I know the basics of jQuery, with selectors and stuff. does anyone have any tips re documentation/tutorials/examples for jQuery UI?
[03:31:14] <masak> specifically, is there something that everyone wish they had known from the start that I should be aware of? :)
[03:35:49] <GuySoft> hey all, does anyone here know how to get the zomming in jqplot working correctly? it seems to get stuck and would not let me zoom right on the x axis: http://localhost:8000/server/server1
[03:36:42] <Zhy> setTimeout(testFu(), 10000);  in testFu I simply alert some text - but it happens immediately. What am I doing wrong?
[03:42:20] <Whirl3d> mindis|wurk, thanks. I tried using fontsquirrel and it worked for a while, but now it just won't work. I know that's sound vague, but wtf. I'll be glad to see the day when designing a web page is more about the design and less about the code necessary to reproduce the design in every browser
[03:43:29] <mindis|wurk> that day will never come
[03:43:29] <s-Code> hear hear
[03:43:57] <Lucky--> here is my big f u to finally getting to say that this 900 lines of javascript mobile app is finished. didn't take long to build, took days to debug everything <3 js's variable scope and this ptr and its loose typing. :/ eh
[03:44:30] <zatan> hey how can I select this  $(':input[type="submit"] .default') ?
[03:45:50] <Whirl3d> zatan, that asks for the element with a class of default INSIDE the submit button. arfaik, there shouldn't be things inside the submit button...but I could be wrong
[03:46:08] <mindis|wurk> sigh. how the fuck can it be this difficult to vertically align a little text so that it works in both chrome and FF is beyond me...
[03:46:29] <Whirl3d> vertically align center?
[03:47:05] <Whirl3d> Zhy, testFu() is not a function
[03:47:16] <Zhy> only testFu then ?
[03:47:18] <Whirl3d> it's the value returned from the function testFU
[03:47:22] <Whirl3d> yep
[03:47:23] <Zhy> oh :0
[03:47:26] <Zhy> thanks :)
[03:47:29] <Whirl3d> np
[04:43:29] <jpadilla> Hey guys, I'm trying to do a cross domain ajax POST request, so it can't be jsonp. On my server I already have the headers to allow any origin, but I keep getting the XMLHttpRequest cannot load... Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[04:49:50] <Dieterbe> hey guys, i'm trying to figure out what the stuff on line 1 ('(function( $ ) {'), line 36 ('$.fn.editable_in_place') and the last line ('})( jQuery );') is @ https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/blob/master/webapp/content/js/jquery.graphite.js
[04:57:42] <VaibhavR> Hi...
[04:57:48] <VaibhavR> facing a wierd issue...
[04:57:53] <VaibhavR> on firefox
[04:58:10] <VaibhavR> while making an ajax call in firefox....
[04:58:25] <VaibhavR> the error callback function is called before server sends the response
[04:59:12] <VaibhavR> Its a form where first username is validated via Ajax call...if the call will be successful... then form will be submitted via javascript
[04:59:57] <VaibhavR> but before the server sends response for username validation...the error callback is called and form is submitted...this is happening only on firefox...
[05:00:06] <boulet101010> This is the jquery code of the insert function : http://snipurl.com/24dn0ov , can somebody comment it?
[05:01:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a td with a certain name... but when I do in jquery alert(this.name); it gives "undefined"
[05:01:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why is that?
[05:13:26] <arussel> how do I create decorator ? I want to provide a default fnDrawCallback function that will call specific fnDrawCallback function if defined
[05:15:40] <eddyb> how can this take 7 bloody seconds? window.getSelection().removeAllRanges()
[05:16:36] <masak> I'd like to compliment you all on http://jqueryui.com/download -- it's very sleek.
[05:17:08] <Dieterbe> does anyone knows what this does '(function( $ ) {.....})( jQuery );' ? or '$.fn.<foo> = (...)'?
[05:17:11] <masak> the "Theme" pulldown leaves something to desired, because there's no way to know what a theme looks like. but that's a minor kvetch.
[05:18:39] <masak> oh, the demos have all the themes.
[05:20:16] <xec_> masak: there is a gallery under themes (top menu)
[05:20:33] <masak> ok, nice.
[05:21:04] <masak> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ doesn't feel right on Chrome for Ubuntu. something about the box "twitching" each time I start dragging it. is this a known issue?
[05:21:30] <masak> it gets worse the further from its origin I ove it.
[05:21:32] <masak> move*
[05:44:21] <shoky> Dieterbe: the first one is an immediately-executed function expression, where jQuery is passed as the first argument
[05:44:58] <Dieterbe> shoky: actually i found out both things already
[05:44:59] <shoky> Dieterbe: the second one defines a property on $.fn which is same as jQuery.prototype
[05:45:07] <Dieterbe> thanks anyway though!
[05:45:15] <shoky> o didn't notice it's been a while
[05:51:04] <masak> http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started says I should get an index.html with my .zip file, but I just got development-bundle/ and js/
[05:52:13] <masak> was that because I selected "no theme"?
[05:53:31] <masak> yeah, seems so. when I selected a theme, I got it.
[06:16:34] <masak> oh! I figured out why http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ is behaving strangely for me. it's because I wasn't zoomed 100%.
[06:17:06] <masak> I consider this a bug. would anyone benefit from me submitting a bug report somewhere?
[06:21:54] <niels__> I have a dropdown, when there is a change jquery does something accordingly. It works fine. But if the form i submitted, and user clicks the back button, suddenly the ID's which where displayed are now hidden. And the user has to reselect the option in the dropdown. Am I wrong in using .change() like this http://pastebin.com/3pWLZjnR :(
[06:22:25] <xec_> masak: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ search through and make sure it's not already reported before submitting your own
[06:22:38] <masak> understood. thanks.
[06:22:41] <thestapler> I am trying to load a jqueryui tab content via ajax, and it keeps timing out... is there an execution timeout, or a content length limit for ajax requests?
[06:26:05] <masak> it doesn't seem to be already reported. writing up a ticket.
[06:27:59] <Mewoth> Hey guys is there a way of on the fly changin a input text field into a textarea?
[06:28:04] <Mewoth> I tried .html() but didn't work
[06:28:35] <sunbeam> i'd like to check with javascript whether a user already has a certain cookie for my site ("I understoof the privacy policy") saved. Any idea how I can do this best?
[06:30:05] <nlogax> thestapler: There is a `timeout' option, but looking at the source it seems it defaults to `0', and only calls xhr.abort() if it's set to > 0
[06:30:32] <nlogax> So dunno if it is relevant
[06:30:43] <rukouen> thestapler: the default is 60 if i can remember...
[06:30:54] <thestapler> nlogax: seems that after about 18 seconds, i get a blank screen...
[06:31:04] <Mewoth> Anyone?
[06:31:21] <pachet> Mewoth : var $mytext = $('#mytextarea'); $mytext.replaceWith('<input type="text" value="' + $mytext.val() + '" />');
[06:31:45] <rukouen> thestapler: could be something on the server side that isn't returning properly?
[06:31:59] <thestapler> http://pastebin.com/jRdYB2is is how i am loading my tabs... i've tried changing the timeout to a rediculously long time, and same results :(
[06:33:11] <thestapler> rukouen: the page that it is requesting data from, is going to be pretty huge, and probably going to take about 1 minute to execute... (LONG story), but for the average profile that I am loading, it is done in about 2 seconds
[06:33:27] <Mewoth> pachet that will change the text input into textarea?
[06:33:48] <Mewoth> pachet
[06:34:07] <pachet> Mewoth: oh my bad, i read that backwards
[06:34:33] <pachet> '<textarea>' + $mytext.val() + '</textarea>' instead then
[06:35:15] <nlogax> thestapler: Silly question, but does it work by itself, if you request it directly?
[06:35:23] <thestapler> yes.
[06:36:49] <pachet> sunbeam: if ( document.cookie.indexOf('mycookie') > -1 ) //it's set
[06:36:58] <thestapler> nlogax: actually... no, it isn't... HMMM... I thought it was...  I will look into that now...
[06:37:00] <nlogax> thestapler: Hmm, 10000 is just 10 seconds
[06:37:09] <Mewoth> pachet thanks.. apparently it doesn't render my CSS now sigh
[06:37:33] <thestapler> nlogax: yeah, i was just trying anything... and the pastebin happened to have the 10second version
[06:39:02] <majd_> Hey #jquery - is there a way to make datatables (or any other jquery plugin), allow selecting ranges of cells within a table? i.e. the way you can do in any other desktop spreadsheet editor, selecting cells e.g C2:F9
[06:50:30] <christo_m> Anyone ever get TypeError: body is undefined
[06:50:39] <christo_m> its in jquery.js but i doubt thats the culprit
[06:51:25] <sunbeam> pachet: thanks
[06:53:58] <Whirl3d> when namespacing an event for binding, how do you unbind multiple events that use the same namespace?
[06:55:18] <Whirl3d> $("element").bind({mouseenter.test:function () {}, mouseleave.test:function () {}});   can you bind multiple namespaced events using the object binding notation or do I have to do it differently.
[06:55:36] <Whirl3d> The goal, is to be able to unbind all ".test" event handlers.
[06:55:59] <thestapler> nlogax: turns out, I am exceeding my memory limit of 512M in PHP... looking at fixing this now... sorry for any trouble
[06:57:17] <pachet> Whirl3d: i havent used it in a while, but pretty sure you can just unbind all events in a namespace via $(foo).unbind('.mynamespace')
[06:57:44] <Whirl3d> pachet, thatnks. I'm trying it now.
[06:59:16] <warrenparsons> christo_m: Are you putting your script calls in the HEAD of your document and not wrapping their executions in a $(document).ready()?
[06:59:46] <christo_m> warrenparsons: they are not in the HEAD, but they are wrapped in document ready
[07:00:14] <warrenparsons> christo_m: Weird. Is the page publicly accessible?
[07:05:42] <thestapler> nlogax: Now that I have fixed my query, and am not "select *" needlessly (still developing, so it was just easier) I am good... thanks for reminding me to check that things really are working before
[07:06:03] <nlogax> thestapler: Yay :)
[07:10:19] <Whirl3d> how do you disable a button? I thought it was btn.prop('disabled', true);
[07:13:10] <Roragok_> anyone good with jquery sliders? having a strange issue where my slider jumps down ignoreing step on the first click of the slider
[07:13:38] <pachet> Whirl3d: try .attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[07:14:18] <Working> I'm using the following function to replace a variable if it is inside a certain class, "special." Is there a cleaner way to do it? http://jsfiddle.net/rDeHK/
[07:16:19] <johnkpaul> Working: http://jsfiddle.net/rDeHK/1/ you don't need to re-query the dom
[07:16:34] <sl0ppy> anyone know what might be up with this http://pastebin.com/5gZxEV9P
[07:16:50] <Working> Thanks johnkpaul! I'll try it out.
[07:16:51] <sl0ppy> textContext goes undefined
[07:18:28] <dabear> sl0ppy: try $.text(this)
[07:18:33] <pachet> you can also assign $(this) to a variable so you don't have to call it twice
[07:18:34] <pachet> Working^
[07:19:09] <sl0ppy> dabear: ok
[07:19:11] <dabear> sl0ppy: this.textContext;
[07:19:21] <dabear> there is no such thing as textConteXt
[07:19:37] <dabear> textContent
[07:21:02] <sl0ppy> oh
[07:21:57] <warrenparsons> Working , pachet var $this = $(this); is something I use so often I've got a shortcut set up for it in Vim.
[07:23:03] <sl0ppy> dabear: nice work that was it :) heh
[07:23:15] <sl0ppy> eyes played tricks on me
[07:24:31] * fris steals sl0ppy's garbage pail kids cards
[07:25:42] <sl0ppy> fris sup
[07:37:24] <Working> johnkpaul: The script you sent me doesn't seem to be working. Any idea why?
[07:37:49] <johnkpaul> :) Working, not one bit of an idea why
[07:37:53] <johnkpaul> do you see any errors?
[07:38:03] <Zeph88> is there a way to get the effects of button() to apply to a <input type=submit?
[07:40:09] <Working> johnkpaul: No idea personally, looking at the page source after it loads, it appears all the variables are in place and the script has run, just the variables for the specific class weren't actually replaced
[07:40:34] <johnkpaul> and they were before?
[07:41:41] <Working> Yep, I'll double check now that they were before
[07:44:52] <Working> johnkpaul: Yes the original script works fine :(
[07:45:37] <mister_m> is it possible to have safari pretend to be an iphone browser for testing purposes ?
[07:45:39] <johnkpaul> that is surprising Working, all I did was change queries to $(this), but you'll have to debug if you want to find out why
[07:45:43] <johnkpaul> or just switch back
[07:45:46] <mister_m> I don't have an iphone to test with
[07:46:59] <Working> johnkpaul: Alright thanks for your help
[07:48:47] <johnkpaul> mister_m: do you have a mac? you can use the ios simulator
[07:48:53] <johnkpaul> for free, or at most $5
[07:49:29] * warrenparsons is using the iOS simulator right now.
[07:49:32] <mister_m> johnkpaul: naturally, I don't
[07:51:27] <mister_m> I can set the user agent to iphone in safari that will do for now
[07:53:16] <zatan> Hey how can I get the last value TR foe example $('#add_products_table tbody').children('tr:last - 4 ') ? from the last TR minus 4 TR
[07:53:59] <Y3Klo> Morning guys! I'm having a bit troubles with jQuery 1.7.2 $.on() method.
[07:54:01] <Y3Klo> I want to bind some function to JS-Inserted elements (all of them) without an event, just like the $.live() method did before, is there a way to accomplish that with the $.on() method?
[07:55:17] <Y3Klo> I mean the $.on() method requires an event to fire the function, any event, but it's required, I want to bind the function to the elements without any (just when they're added, they must had the function binded).
[07:55:23] <Y3Klo> Does that make sense?
[07:56:23] <Y3Klo> zatan: Try $('table tr:last')
[07:56:42] <Y3Klo> zatan: Insert a "tbody" between those :)
[07:57:01] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: yes $("body").on("click", ".yourelement", function() {})
[07:57:53] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: also, you should replace the body selector with the closest element to your targets you won't modify.
[07:58:01] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: But I don't want the "click" event, the function needs to be attached just after they're added, not at click.
[07:58:26] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: what event do you want to trigger it on then?
[07:58:49] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: None.
[07:59:03] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: so why do you wanna use on()?
[07:59:22] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: I want to use $.live(), but it's now depecrated.
[07:59:37] <Y3Klo> It did exactly what I wanted, just the selector and function to bind.
[07:59:39] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: live does the same thing i showed you
[07:59:54] <hooloovoo> just tell us what you're trying to do and we'll come up with a good solution =)
[07:59:57] <Y3Klo> So it's ALWAYS the "click"? Ecent?
[08:00:01] <Y3Klo> *event
[08:00:10] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: you can use any event you want
[08:00:42] <Y3Klo> I've many form's fields JS-Added, I need to bind one custom autocomplete function.
[08:01:18] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: you need a autocomplete function bound to events when they're added to your DOM?
[08:01:40] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: The default ones already have the function of course (it's attached at the load), but the JS-Added doesn't, that's why I wanted $.live(), to do something like:
[08:01:42] <Y3Klo> $('mySelector').live('myFunction');
[08:01:46] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: Yeah.
[08:01:48] <hooloovoo> you should use somerthing like $("body").on("keyup", "form input", function() { autocomplete code })
[08:02:26] <Y3Klo> I thought about it, but it wouldn't that "stack" the functions one over another?
[08:02:34] <hooloovoo> no
[08:02:43] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: At every "keyup" event it'd bind the function again.
[08:02:53] <Y3Klo> Or am I wrong?
[08:02:56] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: you don't bind the function
[08:03:05] <hooloovoo> you run it
[08:03:16] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: Ooooh! I get it! Sorry.
[08:03:24] <Y3Klo> Ok, I'll try it and tell you.
[08:03:28] <Y3Klo> Just 2 minutes.
[08:04:01] <hooloovoo> Y3Klo: i'm heading home in a minute, but i'm sure someone can pick up where i left you. =)
[08:04:23] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: Oh, ok.
[08:04:27] <Y3Klo> Thank you mate.
[08:04:32] <hooloovoo> np!
[08:05:43] <Y3Klo> hooloovoo: Works like a charm.
[08:05:46] <Y3Klo> Thank you!
[08:05:55] <hooloovoo> yay!
[08:06:34] <Y3Klo> I had a lot of time w/o JS, I forgot a bit about how it works, lol =P
[08:08:48] <sl0ppy> fris: what have you been up to? still on efnet?
[08:09:28] <gmurphey> anyone have a second to take a look at this? http://jsbin.com/axudud/3/edit
[08:09:50] <gmurphey> trying to figure out how options.name can be a string or function.
[08:09:53] <Y3Klo> gmurphey: What do you need'
[08:11:10] <hph> hi everyone. can anyone tell me what kind of jQuery identifier I would use to cause a plugin function to fire when this field is submitted by clicking the enter button?   http://bpaste.net/show/FwTO4z5ofdaxp9090UWr/
[08:11:19] <HassanS> whats the between .bind() and on() ?
[08:11:32] <hooloovoo> HassanS: .bind is old
[08:11:44] <HassanS> do the do the same thing?
[08:11:46] <hooloovoo> also it doesn't include the delegate function
[08:11:52] <hooloovoo> well, they can do the same thing
[08:11:58] <hooloovoo> .on() can do a couple more things as well
[08:12:16] <HassanS> cool thank you :)
[08:12:23] <masak> I'm using .insertBefore -- but I want it to duplicate an element, not move it. what do I do?
[08:13:02] <hooloovoo> masak: check out .clone()
[08:13:02] <troll-boy> morning kids
[08:13:08] <troll-boy> who's got questions I can answer
[08:13:23] <masak> hooloovoo: gotcha, thanks :)
[08:13:27] <HassanS> mornin!
[08:13:38] <dabear> troll-boy: your troll mom can give you answers
[08:13:45] <dabear> oh
[08:13:49] <dabear> you wanted questions
[08:13:51] <dabear> I see
[08:13:55] <troll-boy> yup
[08:14:03] <HassanS> hph had a question that wasn't answered i believe
[08:14:07] <dabear> What's the meaning of poo?
[08:14:07] <troll-boy> and she can actually, but only on MS Office... which I don't use
[08:14:08] <hph> can anyone tell me what kind of jQuery identifier I would use to cause a plugin function to fire when this field is submitted by clicking the enter button?   http://bpaste.net/show/FwTO4z5ofdaxp9090UWr/
[08:14:13] <hph> there it is
[08:14:41] <troll-boy> hph, first off, lets kill that onkeypress
[08:14:59] <hph> can't, troll-boy
[08:15:07] <hph> it's build into Oracle Apex
[08:15:17] <troll-boy> oh
[08:15:18] <troll-boy> crap
[08:15:22] <troll-boy> ok I can work around it
[08:15:26] <troll-boy> on account of my awesome
[08:15:27] <hph> well i could, but my boss want's it there
[08:15:32] <HassanS> you could remove it with jquery couldn't you? or would that break something
[08:15:32] <troll-boy> producing you a fiddle now
[08:15:37] <troll-boy> tell your boss there's better ways
[08:15:44] <hph> he just wants blockUI to fire when it's pressed
[08:15:45] <troll-boy> and yeah.. I'm totally removing it with jquery anyway
[08:15:46] <troll-boy> lol
[08:15:47] <dabear> douche boss
[08:15:57] <hph> no, it
[08:16:14] <HassanS> i love this irc channel. it's the  most active/helpful coding one I've found
[08:16:15] <hph> s just that we need the page to be able to be submitted through pressing Enter
[08:16:43] <troll-boy> which that won't do, lol
[08:16:51] <HassanS> lol
[08:16:51] <troll-boy> show me your <form> tag plz
[08:16:58] <troll-boy> so I can incorporate that as well
[08:17:54] <hph> http://bpaste.net/show/O4B24h1qCJCAFMM5BRj3/
[08:18:17] <troll-boy> danke
[08:24:27] <hph> so, no idea on what I could do with that?
[08:26:42] <cusco_> hey
[08:26:57] <cusco_> how do I get the last ID of a <li> inside a specified <ul> ?
[08:27:30] <tocka> cusco_ .find()
[08:28:18] <dabear> .find("[id]").last().attr("id")
[08:28:29] <troll-boy> hph, I'm coding you something now in jsfiddle
[08:28:40] <Whirl3d> hph, you will need to handle the keypress event will check to see if the key pressed is the enter key *AND* if the current "focused" field is not a text-input field (or select field with autosuggest) then manually call the submit function.
[08:28:42] <hph> i might have an idea
[08:28:51] <hph> in fact, i'm confident I have an idea
[08:29:03] <hph> i'm working with the document.submit() element
[08:29:04] <Whirl3d> don't be afraid, it'll pass
[08:29:23] <troll-boy> you don't want document.submit
[08:29:30] <Julien_`> Hello everybody
[08:29:34] <troll-boy> you want $('#wwvFlowForm').submit()
[08:29:38] <explodes> Has anyone used Waypoints to bind MULTIPLE sticky headers?
[08:30:11] <Whirl3d> but that only handles the submit event if the submit button is focused.
[08:31:09] <cusco_> thanks dabear
[08:31:15] <Julien_`> want to use this but seems not to work : $(document).on('click', $my_parent $my_children, ...)
[08:31:22] <Julien_`> ()
[08:31:56] <Whirl3d> what is $my_parents $my_children?
[08:31:56] <Julien_`> can i use variable as selector in this case ?
[08:32:11] <Whirl3d> you need to combine them and pass a single string in that case
[08:32:32] <Julien_`> Whirl3d: it is variable that store DOM element as jquery object
[08:32:35] <Whirl3d> var selector=$my_parents+" "+$my_children;    if they are both strings
[08:32:56] <Julien_`> hum..ok :) thanks a mot
[08:33:06] <Whirl3d> But if they are jquery objects...
[08:33:14] <Julien_`> ...
[08:33:32] <Julien_`> yes they are
[08:33:35] <troll-boy> odd my jsfiddle is being a bastard
[08:33:46] <Whirl3d> $my_parent, $myChildren, ?
[08:34:08] <Whirl3d> or maybe $my_parent.add($my_children);
[08:34:50] <Whirl3d> I would just use $(document).on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target) if (targ.is($my_parents)||targ.is($my_children)) {do stuff});
[08:35:25] <Julien_`> 		$(document).on('click', '#my_parent .children_class', function(){...});
[08:35:25] <Julien_`>  
[08:36:14] <troll-boy> is it just me or is jsfiddle broke for you all?
[08:36:17] <jeffsmykil> Best tree view plugin?
[08:36:31] <Julien_`> but i want the element $('#my_parent') to be stored : var $parent = $('#parent')
[08:37:08] <Julien_`> The question is importanti believe, because the selector in this case seems to be a string ...
[08:37:27] <blendedbychris> soooo
[08:37:48] <Julien_`> so impossible to do this : 		$(document).on('click', $('#parent').find('.children'), function(){...});
[08:37:48] <Julien_`>  
[08:38:10] <silverwind> ...
[08:38:27] <silverwind>  $(document).on('click', '#parent .children', function(){...}) ?
[08:39:58] <Julien_`> silverwind: ok but if i want to put $('#parent') in variable ?
[08:40:08] <Julien_`> no way to do this ?
[08:41:23] <troll-boy> hph, this *should* work, not understanding WHY its not working in JSFiddle atm
[08:41:24] <troll-boy> http://jsfiddle.net/UADPN/2/
[08:42:33] <troll-boy> err http://jsfiddle.net/UADPN/5/
[08:43:23] <pachet> troll-boy: var is a reserved keyword
[08:43:32] <pachet> function submitEnter(var1,var2){
[08:44:30] <troll-boy> yup already fixed
[08:44:51] <troll-boy> http://jsfiddle.net/UADPN/8/   hph this works, enjoy
[08:45:35] <troll-boy> god bless the JSLint button
[08:46:00] <hph> troll-boy, what if i want the keypress to do both that original submitEnter function and the new stuff i'm trying to add?
[08:47:17] <troll-boy> hph like this http://jsfiddle.net/UADPN/11/  ??
[08:47:52] <troll-boy> hph, or like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/UADPN/13/  ??
[08:48:09] <hph> hmm possibly. i'm having trouble understanding some of this because I've never really worked with jQuery
[08:48:20] <troll-boy> ok lemme walk you through it
[08:48:27] <hph> here's what I have now:
[08:48:30] <troll-boy> first we have 2 standard javascript function declarations
[08:48:33] <hph> (it's not working for some reason
[08:48:46] <troll-boy> standard everyday normal javascript (not jquery)
[08:48:49] <troll-boy> you follow those ok?
[08:49:06] <troll-boy> the submitEnter() and newStuff()
[08:49:19] <hph> http://bpaste.net/show/CiYpCT46uNUMfyrpYM5X/
[08:49:21] <troll-boy> submitEnter() is a place holder for whatever your current submitEnter does
[08:49:41] <hph> okay
[08:50:04] <troll-boy> now.. see that comment where I say "kill that stupid..."
[08:50:24] <hph> yeah
[08:50:39] <troll-boy> I'm grabbing the input object and removing the onkeypress attribute (setting it to '')
[08:51:05] <troll-boy> next I'm grabbing your form (like you are in that bpaste sample) and binding the submit event
[08:51:52] <troll-boy> now... I've never used your blockUI plugin, so you're probably on your own on that one
[08:51:54] <troll-boy> HOWEVER
[08:52:11] <troll-boy> you wanna move that $('#Cancel') out of the submit function
[08:52:27] <troll-boy> between lines 7 & 9 on your paste
[08:52:40] <troll-boy> btw, if you're looking for jquery help, jsfiddle is the bestest pastebin out there
[08:52:42] <troll-boy> brb cigarette
[08:52:49] <HassanS> you've earned it
[08:54:22] <hph> hmm it
[08:54:27] <hph> s not working for some reason
[08:55:02] <HassanS> did hef give you the code in a fiddle?
[08:55:39] <hph> http://bpaste.net/show/8HrFVl9lAcuGGHk7kVDi/
[08:55:52] <hph> any reason why that shouldn't work? it's what i have now
[08:56:17] <dabear> lol
[08:56:18] <dabear> return
[08:56:25] <dabear> followed by more statements
[08:56:37] <dabear> if you return, you cannot do anything more in that function
[08:59:03] <troll-boy> 2 things
[08:59:24] <troll-boy> 1 you have your return before your blockUI.. which means your function will never get to blockUI
[08:59:40] <troll-boy> return ends the function and dumps the output back to whatever called it
[08:59:52] <troll-boy> 2 you still have your cancel inside your submit
[09:00:53] <troll-boy> hph, see this:  http://jsfiddle.net/UADPN/15/
[09:01:15] <troll-boy> that won't work btw, as I don't have the blockUI plugin available to jsfiddle, BUT its how your code should look/work
[09:03:00] <eni> what does .modal doe (example:$('<div id="poplist" class="toggle_container">'+vidlist+'</div>').modal({onShow:function(dialog) {)
[09:03:48] <troll-boy> .modal disables the rest of the page if set to true
[09:04:41] <eni> troll-boy, it is a function in this case, I don't get it..
[09:04:48] <eni> is that a jquery function?
[09:05:15] <troll-boy> eni, I've only used it with jquery ui on dialog's.. researching it now
[09:05:28] <eni> yes it is a dialog thing in my case as well.
[09:05:29] <eni> thanks :)
[09:05:54] <troll-boy> hph, you getting anywhere with that?
[09:11:34] <eni> troll-boy, link me something if you find it :) thanks
[09:13:19] <hph> its giving me an error about parentheses
[09:13:35] <hph> sorry, in a meeting :P
[09:16:50] <masak> is there some well-known pattern for making a draggable both be dragged and stay in place? essentially cloning it when on start.
[09:17:08] <masak> (I have a toolbox of things that should replenish as they are dragged in place.)
[09:20:31] <g0z> hm, I know how to do that with yui2 but not jquery, sorry.
[09:25:29] <Gates> Does modernizr need special setup to get start with it?
[09:27:50] <fris> gates dont think
[09:27:52] <fris> so
[09:27:52] <b-ot> fris, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[09:28:29] <Gates> I have no idea why it doesnt work
[09:28:33] <Gates> the js file is linked and working
[09:28:36] <Gates> and html has the class it needs
[09:29:25] <Gates> oh i am stupid
[09:29:29] <Gates> i need to add the class before it dont i
[09:40:04] <Gates> fris: stupid question, does modernizr enable these features
[09:40:17] <Gates> or just add classes that just allow alternatives when not supported
[09:52:21] <MistuhKurtz> so, I've tried all sorts of ways to measure the width of the browser viewport, without the scroll bar. All sorts of different combinations of width, outerWidth, clientWidth, scrollWidth, innerWidth, jquery's width methods, on the window & document objects, $('body'), $('html'), and nothing seems to account for the scroll bar
[09:52:32] <MistuhKurtz> Does anybody have experience with this dilemma?
[10:01:19] <troll-boy> hi MistuhKurtz
[10:01:25] <MistuhKurtz> hey
[10:01:26] <troll-boy> whatcha tryin to do?
[10:01:59] <MistuhKurtz> I have a full-screen slideshow and so I need to measure the screen width and size the container
[10:09:09] <troll-boy> hmm
[10:09:38] <troll-boy> and $(window).height() and $(window).width() don't work for you?
[10:11:27] <scalex000> I need help with jquery not work
[10:12:07] <troll-boy> good to know scalex000!  although you'll get more and better help if you say "Hey guys, I'm trying to do X and getting this error/but its not working/but I don't know how"
[10:12:42] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, you try $(window).height or $(document).height yet?
[10:13:23] <MistuhKurtz> yeah I've tried pretty much everything. There are lots of answers on stack overflow that say they've figured it out but none of them work
[10:13:40] <troll-boy> hmm
[10:13:44] <troll-boy> you got a jsfiddle for me?
[10:13:47] <MistuhKurtz> I'm going to see if I can just change around my elements and their positioning to accomplish what I need
[10:13:54] <MistuhKurtz> instead of sizing the width
[10:14:05] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, shouldn't be needed, I'd much rather help you do it "The Right Way" (tm)
[10:14:09] <MistuhKurtz> the problem is I have a a "previous" and "next" button
[10:14:18] <troll-boy> inside the same container?
[10:14:24] <troll-boy> you got a url I can see?
[10:17:03] <shoky> MistuhKurtz it becomes simple if you have your own containers for the content and not count on the outer window width
[10:17:27] <shoky> for example: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/LpmuG/
[10:17:59] <shoky> don't think there's a way to do that just based on window's width
[10:18:22] <imachuchu> I have a group of text fields and I'm trying to clone one of them. These fields have the jquery-ui autocomplete attached to them via a shared class. When I clone one of them, and change the id of the cloned field, the autcomplete doesn't show. The code I'm using to attach is: $( "input.nodcAutocomplete" ).on( "keydown.autocomplete",  function(){
[10:18:39] <shoky> cause that will always report the actual viewport size, possibly not including the scrollbar
[10:19:24] <troll-boy> imachuchu, target by class
[10:20:21] <imachuchu> troll-boy: ack, sorry that's some in testing code, this is what I'm actually using: $( document ).on( "focusin", ".nodcAutocomplete", function(){
[10:20:40] <MistuhKurtz> Sorry guys my boss was talking to me
[10:20:53] <imachuchu> troll-boy: and I am attaching via class, the ".nodcAutocomplete" part (though you couldn't tell, what with me posting useless code)
[10:20:54] <shoky> how rude of him
[10:20:55] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, kill him.
[10:21:01] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:21:03] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/k6kPKiVJ
[10:21:08] <MistuhKurtz> the troll-boy tells me to kill you!
[10:21:19] <troll-boy> so it was written, and so it shall be done.
[10:21:25] <MistuhKurtz> well anyways, I think I've figured out a solution
[10:21:49] <scalex000> this script only work here $('#element_6_6')
[10:22:00] <troll-boy> imachuchu, maybe try live
[10:22:02] <scalex000> not work $('#element_6_4').autocomplete
[10:22:21] <troll-boy> imachuchu, http://api.jquery.com/live/
[10:22:45] <MistuhKurtz> Disclaimer: this isn't my project, it's a mess. I was asked to fix the gallery because my coworker was having trouble with it -__- http://brookfield-la.epxhost.com/community-gallery/
[10:23:08] * troll-boy fires up the hate engine to point at MistuhKurtz and blame him for all this
[10:23:16] <MistuhKurtz> ;_;
[10:23:18] <imachuchu> troll-boy: live is marked as depreciated (says use .on instead), what's the difference between the two (or how can I get .on to do what .live is needed for)?
[10:23:19] <troll-boy> where is the gallery thing at?
[10:23:50] <troll-boy> imachuchu, http://api.jquery.com/live/  <-- where you seeing a deprication notice?
[10:23:57] <scalex000> troll-boy, you mad, im try to think in english
[10:24:26] <troll-boy> scalex000, yes.  Yes I am mad.  What is your native tongue scalex000?
[10:24:33] <scalex000> spanish
[10:25:00] <imachuchu> troll-boy: part way down the page: "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live()."
[10:25:04] <troll-boy> imachuchu, live() is apply this to target, and all future things that may come to be that match that target, where as  on() is apply to target
[10:25:30] <scalex000> Im trying to do fill a variable with data, I check the script and return the data when I choose the country but when I type in state not apper nothing.
[10:25:39] <imachuchu> troll-boy: let me check it out and see if it works
[10:25:41] <scalex000> troll-boy, spanish
[10:26:01] <scalex000> troll-boy, hahaha my native tongue hahahaha
[10:26:09] <scalex000> troll-boy, mad mad mad
[10:26:37] <troll-boy> que bueno, y si, yo soy muy loco, pero tu quero que con jquery?
[10:27:05] <troll-boy> you getting any errors scalex000?? You got a live url or a jsfiddle I can look at?
[10:27:08] <scalex000> troll-boy, its okey, I know when I try to say something I dont know to begin
[10:27:22] <scalex000> troll-boy, nop.
[10:27:32] <troll-boy> nope to both questions?
[10:27:35] <scalex000> troll-boy, 200.88.120.178/senderform.php
[10:28:06] <scalex000> troll-boy, no errors, yes, I give the url
[10:28:09] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, where is your gallery?
[10:28:14] <troll-boy> scalex000, loading now
[10:28:18] <scalex000> troll-boy, go to pais
[10:28:23] <scalex000> troll-boy, go to pais input
[10:28:33] <MistuhKurtz> troll-boy, I posted the link
[10:28:36] <MistuhKurtz> http://brookfield-la.epxhost.com/community-gallery/
[10:28:59] <scalex000> troll-boy, push any key and you will see appear 2 countries, choose republica dominicana
[10:29:08] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, but I'm not seeing a gallery on here? Either I'm having an acid flash back or I have to click something it turn it on
[10:29:55] <shoky> imachuchu: $(selector).live(type, fn)  ===  $(document).on(type, selector, fn)
[10:30:09] <scalex000> troll-boy, after you select it the function fill the var statelist in array, when you go to provincia and type not appear nothing
[10:30:21] <troll-boy> scalex000, first thing I notice that I don't like is your /ajax_* return a mimetype of text/html which is wrong/bad
[10:30:50] <troll-boy> You want application/json
[10:31:18] <scalex000> troll-boy, the php that run this source i put json
[10:31:28] <troll-boy> with php that would be header('Content-type: application/json');
[10:31:53] <scalex000> troll-boy, :(
[10:31:58] <troll-boy> right, but when jquery reads it, your server tells jquery that its a html file not a json file, which can cause issues
[10:32:09] <scalex000> ok
[10:32:28] <scalex000> that netbeans so dumbass hahaha
[10:32:56] <troll-boy> scalex000, I use and *love* phpstorm
[10:32:59] <troll-boy> check it out
[10:33:06] <scalex000> its a joke
[10:33:11] <tash> I've got a function that returns data, like function(data){  console.log(data); } and that console.log output looks like this: http://pastebin.com/4LcRhvCA  Is there some way to loop through data to find the rel="start" values ?
[10:33:18] <troll-boy> much lighter than netbeans, and if you only do php/html/javascript its all you need
[10:33:57] <troll-boy> tash, there sure is..
[10:34:27] <troll-boy> but you've got multiple rel="start" there, whatcha trying to do?
[10:35:15] <tash> troll-boy: I want to find out if $('#jobstart').val(); equals any of the rel="start" values returned in that data.  #jobstart is something a user inputs ( a datepicker )
[10:35:19] <Grundell_> if i have a sign list is toggled how do i change the "toggle text"
[10:35:19] <troll-boy> but yeah you could just .each through the children of $('.schedule-entry') and if thechild.attr('rel') == 'start' doStuff()
[10:35:21] <Grundell_>  ?
[10:35:42] <tash> troll-boy, I think that is what I'm after
[10:35:56] <troll-boy> Grundell_, your question makes little sense to me... perhaps an example?
[10:36:00] <scalex000> troll-boy, not work, let me ask you, do you think Im not start using the correct event,  maybe the autocomplete use the var empty when load the page
[10:36:04] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, did you see my last question?
[10:36:04] <Grundell_> hang on
[10:36:34] <troll-boy> scalex000, I'm refreshing.. uno momento por favor.. pero tu teines FireBug?
[10:36:58] <tash> troll-boy: how do I get into "data" to do the .each on that tr?
[10:37:46] <scalex000> yes
[10:37:59] <troll-boy> ceck the headers and Content-type
[10:38:02] <troll-boy> but I'm still looking
[10:38:05] <troll-boy> scalex000,
[10:38:18] <scalex000> troll-boy, yes, application/json
[10:38:39] <troll-boy> you grab that table, grab its subsequent tbody, then the children of that tbody will be your tr's
[10:38:55] <troll-boy> the tbody stuff was for tash
[10:39:56] <troll-boy> scalex000, where is your javascript for the autocompletes?
[10:40:03] <imachuchu> shoky, troll-boy: so  bit of debugging later, both .on and .live are kind of working (in that they both will get called, based on a console.log), but the autocomplete doesn't show. fiddle at:http://jsfiddle.net/KEWRZ/
[10:40:21] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/k6kPKiVJ
[10:40:35] <troll-boy> scalex000, no in the url you pasted me where's the JS
[10:40:57] <imachuchu> also by looking at the server it is getting called to pull the autocomplete entries from the database, and is properly returning them, but the autocomplete box just isn't showing them
[10:41:11] <tash> troll-boy: I think I'm confused with interacting with "data" in this context.  I'm still a newb.  How do I get into data in order to do that? I can probably get the rest.
[10:41:11] <scalex000> troll-boy, ah
[10:41:24] <troll-boy> why are you doing it that way imachuchu?? can you paste some html into that fiddle.. if you do that I can fix it
[10:41:28] <scalex000> troll-boy, i create an php file called it header.php
[10:41:38] <tash> so, inside my function(data){ } not sure what to put in there to start digging into data
[10:41:40] <scalex000> troll-boy, i downloaded the jquery library
[10:41:43] <troll-boy> can you paste me a link scalex000 ?
[10:42:30] <scalex000> http://200.88.120.178/menu/header.php
[10:42:58] <troll-boy> tash what are you trying to achieve? exactly
[10:43:04] <troll-boy>  see hte 2 rows, each with 2 buttons
[10:43:07] <imachuchu> troll-boy: because the page itself is generated by django, so it will take a while to make up some basic html that will behave the same way.
[10:43:37] <troll-boy> tash,  in lieu of your method of accomplishing it, let me know what the goal is, there may be a better way to accomplish it..
[10:43:55] <tash> troll-boy: ok, one sec
[10:44:46] <troll-boy> imachuchu, http://jsfiddle.net/KEWRZ/1/
[10:45:46] <io__> how can i fill a form with a defined string ?
[10:46:11] <troll-boy> ah your code is in jquery.js scalex000 I see now
[10:46:23] <scalex000> yes
[10:46:30] <scalex000> i paste in pastebin
[10:46:38] <scalex000> troll-boy i paste in pastebin
[10:47:27] <tash> troll-boy: here you go, I tried to lay it out nice and easy: http://pastebin.com/nDbh9hC0  In this context just assume that #jobstart = 2012-07-07 and one of the rel="start" out of the returned data also equals 2012-07-07.  I basically want "if #jobstart equals any of the rel="start" do xyz"
[10:47:28] <scalex000> troll-boy, one part work  but the second part i dont know why
[10:49:17] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. I am having issues with this clone abilty. I can create multiple clones but the remove button is not working http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/sRQLA/6/
[10:49:23] <troll-boy> scalex000, try creating element_6_4 disabled, then in your select method on element6_6 enable it, and THEN bind the autocomplete to it.. your autocomplete is probably just using that empty array you started with
[10:50:12] <troll-boy> tash, that's pretty much the exact opposite of what I asked you for.. but I'll see what I can do
[10:50:25] <scalex000> troll-boy, I though the same
[10:50:37] <scalex000> troll-boy, but Im not a expert,
[10:50:44] <Grundell_> http://pastebin.com/9FjeA5e1 so this is the code that im using (line 10) how do i change the text of "js-toggle-translations" see all when toggled ?
[10:50:45] <imachuchu> troll-boy: no idea why I wasn't using the simpler form (I was having an issue with the autocomplete box fighting with a dialog, but I solved it otherwise) but it still won't carry over to the clone correctly. Working on a more detailed fiddle
[10:51:29] <troll-boy> I did a console.log(StateList); after selecting Republica Dominca and StateList is properly stocked.. so my only explanation is that its only using the original empty StateList... comprende?  Try that and lemme know what it says
[10:51:39] <troll-boy> imachuchu, danke
[10:52:11] <tash> troll-boy: man, i'm sorry
[10:52:43] <troll-boy> tash, also use jsfiddle, its much nicer
[10:52:56] <LindsayMac> whoever invented jsfiddle is a genius ;)
[10:53:01] <Grundell_> any one has a clue ? the toggle translation needs to chage text
[10:53:11] <scalex000> troll-boy, yes
[10:53:22] <troll-boy> tash, in your example.. you're trying to compare id:1 to dates?
[10:53:40] <scalex000> troll-boy, but how to fill after I select or run the autocomplete after
[10:53:44] <troll-boy> LindsayMac, agreed
[10:54:12] <troll-boy> scalex000, you see how you're loading statelist after they select a country?
[10:54:46] <LindsayMac> So does anyone have a thought as to why my remove button isnt removing cloned items? It is clearly adding them just fine but the remove button is not getting enabled with elements = > 1  am having issues with this clone abilty. I can create multiple clones but the remove button is not working http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/sRQLA/6/
[10:54:46] <troll-boy> as part of the loading statelist process do a $('#statebox').enable(); and a $('#statebox').autocomplete('... some crap ... ');
[10:55:10] <scalex000> some crap, hahaha
[10:55:29] <troll-boy> Grundell_, what do you mean "see all"
[10:55:44] <tash> troll-boy: I'm passing id:1 to a page and it is returning that first pastebin I sent you.... with the table and stuff
[10:55:54] <tash> I really just want to know how to each through the data and compare
[10:57:05] <troll-boy> tash, you don't have anything tied to the id's in your html.. you've dates and you've start/end/value for the rel attrib
[10:57:12] <troll-boy> so how do I know which one to grab?
[10:57:26] <monk13> clear
[10:57:38] <monk13> fail^ lol
[10:58:15] <troll-boy> monk13, winning
[10:58:58] <monk13> hehe ;)
[10:59:14] <tash> troll-boy: I didn't paste my entire file.  There is this in my html: <td class="jobstart" id="jobstart"><?=$value->jobstart()?></td> .... so, in the data returned from the .get() I want to compare id="jobstart" from my html to the rel="start" values
[10:59:18] <tash> am I making sense?
[10:59:38] <troll-boy> tash, not in the least, lol
[10:59:48] <tash> hmm
[11:00:38] <troll-boy> what data will /settings/scheduleDialogEntries give me exactly?
[11:00:47] <MistuhKurtz> troll-boy, sorry everybody is bothering me and asking to see the progress >.<
[11:00:49] <troll-boy> I see now that you're passing id=1 to it, but what is ITS data
[11:00:56] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, kill them.
[11:01:03] <MistuhKurtz> yes sir
[11:01:03] <tash> the first pastebin, shall I re-paste?
[11:01:16] <MistuhKurtz> what do you mean you don't see a gallery, troll-boy ?
[11:01:17] <tash> you were helping a million people at once, so I'm sure you were a little confused
[11:01:22] <MistuhKurtz> scroll down?
[11:01:23] <tash> and I suck at explaining so that doesn't help
[11:01:31] <troll-boy> or start answering them with "I've wrote 1 line of code and answered 134 stupid questions... would you like me to change that ratio at all?"
[11:01:38] <MistuhKurtz> there are 3 slideshows on that page, each one takes up the full width & height of the browser
[11:01:48] <troll-boy> tash, I'm never confused.. your original paste was just a html table
[11:01:54] <tash> :)
[11:02:07] <tash> troll-boy:  the returned data from that .get is literally this: http://pastebin.com/4LcRhvCA
[11:02:14] <tash> literally
[11:02:36] <troll-boy> MistuhKurtz, how do I "activate" a slide show.. all I see is that hallway and it turns grey when I mouse over it.. i don't see any galleries at all
[11:02:37] <tash> I want to compare the rel="start" values form that to an id I have on my page in another table
[11:02:40] <troll-boy> ok...
[11:02:45] <tash> forget the "why" for now :)
[11:03:03] <troll-boy> tash, they why is the most important part
[11:03:05] <MistuhKurtz> what browser are you in?
[11:03:08] <MistuhKurtz> scroll down dude
[11:03:09] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[11:03:10] <troll-boy> FF
[11:03:19] <MistuhKurtz> click "happy living" in the bottom-left corner
[11:03:32] <troll-boy> OH I see them now MistuhKurtz
[11:03:37] <MistuhKurtz> lmao
[11:03:55] <MistuhKurtz> Looks like I need to give the designers a usability seminar
[11:03:56] <HassanS> how do I get the children of $(this) in a function
[11:04:13] <troll-boy> HassanS, $(this).children();
[11:04:21] <HassanS> ty
[11:04:24] <MistuhKurtz> jQuery, IT'S MAGIC!
[11:04:26] <HassanS> can I use it inside of a selector?
[11:04:31] <MistuhKurtz> inside?
[11:04:39] <troll-boy> HassanS, you can use it whereever you can use javascript
[11:04:40] <MistuhKurtz> can you give an example?
[11:04:43] <HassanS> i.e (this < div)
[11:04:51] <HassanS> i.e $(this < div)
[11:04:55] <MistuhKurtz> wat
[11:04:55] <b-ot> They seem to be moving backward in this retrospect.
[11:05:38] <troll-boy> tash, so far I still have no idea wtf you're trying to do, although from what I've seen so far, I'm about 95% sure you're doing it wrong.. so that said.. lets try this again.. what is your end goal
[11:05:49] <MistuhKurtz> What are you trying to do HassanS ? I don't believe < is a selector.. > on the other hand, is the immediate-child selector.
[11:06:02] <HassanS> yeah that was a typo I meant >
[11:06:29] <HassanS> I'm trying to create one click function to apply to all buttons of a certain type throughout my page
[11:06:39] <DeltaHeavy> Are there any disadvantages to using jQuery?
[11:06:41] <HassanS> and the function collapses the div child of this butotn
[11:06:44] <troll-boy> HassanS, might just be easier to target by class that way
[11:06:51] <DeltaHeavy> ##javascript said it's slow and has a history of breaking
[11:06:52] <pisk> scripts go between <script> and </script> and before the </head>  ?
[11:06:58] <troll-boy> DeltaHeavy, code becomes too easy and quick.
[11:07:08] <MistuhKurtz> DeltaHeavy, only if you get lazy and don't optimize code
[11:07:13] <imachuchu> troll-boy: hopefully this helps a little bit more: http://jsfiddle.net/KEWRZ/4/
[11:07:14] <HassanS> troll-boy ok will do.  thank you for the help
[11:07:27] <troll-boy> pisk, scripts go between <script> and </script> but can go anywhere, not just in <head>
[11:07:31] <DeltaHeavy> Well it can't be as fast as normal JS correct assuming it's done properly right?
[11:07:40] <MistuhKurtz> it is normal JS
[11:07:43] <pisk> anywhere in the document, troll-boy ?
[11:07:43] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[11:07:46] <DeltaHeavy> There seems to be a LOT of jQuery hate lol
[11:07:49] <MattDunbar> its not normal
[11:07:49] <troll-boy> pisk, yup
[11:07:49] <MattDunbar> its fucking magic
[11:07:54] <DeltaHeavy> MistuhKurtz: Yeah but, I mean without jQuery lol
[11:08:05] <troll-boy> DeltaHeavy, to each their own
[11:08:06] <pisk> does something need to be within the head to notify of scripthood?
[11:08:09] <imachuchu> troll-boy: there has still been a large amount of JS and html that's been culled (multiple other dialogs and their buttons) so if needed I can start adding that in (but I don't think effect this problem)
[11:08:28] <MistuhKurtz> Any poor performance is not necessarily jQuery's fault. jQuery just makes it easy for a novice to write poorly optimized code
[11:08:34] <DeltaHeavy> troll-boy: I don't even know JS by itself, I want to learn it though. I'm just confused as to why so many people hate jQuery so intensley
[11:08:49] <DeltaHeavy> To me it's the same logic as "EVERYTHING SHOULD BE PROGRAMMED IN ASSEMBLY, FUCK C"
[11:09:05] <DeltaHeavy> But there are some actual arguments, but I'm assuming most the hate is just people who don't like change.
[11:09:05] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy: like anything else with a criticial mass of users, there are people who are passionate about disliking it
[11:09:09] <g0z> I just started using jquery seems ok to me
[11:09:12] <MistuhKurtz> the biggest thing you can do for optimization is to limit your calls to the jQuery object/use of jQuery selectors
[11:09:22] <MistuhKurtz> Cache them in a var if you need to use it repeatedly
[11:09:36] <LindsayMac> Ok so I got the remove button to work, but I am certain there is something wrong with my if statement that enables and disables the add/remove buttons. If someoen can take a look http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/sRQLA/14/
[11:09:37] <MistuhKurtz> chain things so you call jQuery once, not on every single line
[11:09:54] <MistuhKurtz> there are plenty more optimization tips if you just search 'jquery optimziation'
[11:09:55] <LindsayMac> The issue is that you can add all you want, and remove all you want.. but if you add, then remove, you can not add again
[11:10:03] <troll-boy> imachuchu, ok.. so wtf are you trying to do here?
[11:10:21] <pisk> and the opening script tag is:  <script type="text/javascript">   ?
[11:10:33] <MistuhKurtz> pisk, in HTML5 you can just do <script>...</script>
[11:10:43] <pisk> ok..
[11:10:46] <MistuhKurtz> or <script src="/path/to/my/file.js"></script>
[11:11:29] <imachuchu> troll-boy: (I ask myself that every day!) ok, so when the blank line at the end is edited and name/count/weight/split all have valid values, it is saved, cloned, the clone is then cleared, and used as a new blank line (makes somewhat sense?)
[11:11:30] <pisk> thank you, MistuhKurtz
[11:11:51] <PhanLord> is there a nice jquery / jqueryui way to change label of checkbox button in addition to color change i would like to change label text
[11:12:07] <MistuhKurtz> PhanLord, change it on an event?
[11:12:55] <LindsayMac> Alright.. now I am getting closer.. i can add new, remove, and add new again.. but can't remove again http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/sRQLA/15/
[11:13:14] <imachuchu> troll-boy: the problem is that the autocomplete box won't show up on the new cloned name (I have a large set of names on the server that are pulled for the autocomplete source)
[11:14:42] <troll-boy> sorry folks
[11:14:55] * troll-boy throws in the towel for the day and gets back to the work The Man pays him for
[11:15:02] <troll-boy> tty all monday
[11:15:10] <imachuchu> troll-boy: thanks for your time anyway
[11:15:33] <LindsayMac> Anyone have thoughts on my simple if statement quandry? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/sRQLA/15/
[11:16:15] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/sRQLA/16/
[11:16:40] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  THANK YOU!
[11:16:43] <MistuhKurtz> lol sure
[11:16:44] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[11:16:57] <LindsayMac> I knew it was something stupid simple, but i'm still really new with javascript in general..
[11:17:05] <LindsayMac> mind telling me what it was you noticed right away?
[11:17:43] <LindsayMac> so i can learn m
[11:17:44] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:
[11:17:59] <MistuhKurtz> Well it wasn't re-enabling if you deleted all but 1 and then added another 1
[11:18:29] <MistuhKurtz> so in the add function, I just checked if the number was greater than 1, and if it was then I called removeAttr('disabled')
[11:18:31] <MistuhKurtz> if (newNum > 1) $('#btnDel').removeAttr('disabled');
[11:18:38] <MistuhKurtz> that's the only line I added
[11:18:41] <MistuhKurtz> didn't change anything
[11:18:46] <LindsayMac> Ok cool!
[11:19:02] <LindsayMac> i knew it was something stupid, but I could not figure it out.. thanks a million for fixing it and telling me what you did
[11:19:03] <g0z> I'm resisting the urge to look at code today, I'm taking a day off (which doesn't explain why I am on freenode tech channels today)
[11:19:08] <MistuhKurtz> sure
[11:19:19] <g0z> so farewell!
[11:19:20] <LindsayMac> the one thing i DONT want to do is just copy and paste blindly
[11:19:40] <MistuhKurtz> That's good
[11:21:09] <HassanS> how would I go about loading a sound file on a button click?
[11:21:13] <HassanS> is that ajax?
[11:21:25] <MistuhKurtz> Isolating your problem on jsfiddle like you did is also a good thing LindsayMac :)
[11:21:40] <MistuhKurtz> HassanS, check out this library
[11:21:42] <MistuhKurtz> http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/
[11:21:53] <HassanS> ty
[11:21:55] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz or anyone else with a moment.. this code is working just fine, but it is tossing your an error saying num is not defined (even though it is!) and thats effecting my other scripts http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/sRQLA/16/
[11:22:07] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  thanks. One thing I am not new to is debugging and code.. Just the js language
[11:22:11] <MistuhKurtz> well if it says it's not defined, it's not :P
[11:22:40] <jakoch> hi, i'm trying to remove input fields which are added via jq. removing the first element works. http://jsfiddle.net/H8nrX/ how do i bind this correctly?
[11:23:19] <scalex000> troll-boy, ty I fix it
[11:23:38] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, it's an issue of variable scope
[11:24:00] <MistuhKurtz> I suggest you read about javascript & variable scope. I learned about it from a book called DOM Scripting, which is a good resource
[11:24:18] <dabear> LindsayMac: num is not defined, it is only defined inside the click handlers
[11:24:23] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  just googed it..
[11:24:33] <MistuhKurtz> It's not defined because it's out of scope
[11:24:33] <LindsayMac> dabear:  so do I need to redefined it at some point?
[11:24:34] <dabear> the code here is defined outside the handlers: // enable the "remove" button
[11:24:46] <MistuhKurtz> if a variable is defined inside a function, then it is not accessible out of that function
[11:25:47] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think you even need that line of code, LindsayMac. Here's an update: http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/sRQLA/17/
[11:25:52] <dabear> ?debugging @ LindsayMac
[11:26:14] <dabear> bha, bot-t is always down when you need him :(
[11:26:16] <MistuhKurtz> I added disabled="disabled" to the button markup, because you shouldn't be able to remove the first one when you first load the page
[11:26:19] <LindsayMac> lol dabear
[11:26:23] <LindsayMac> I can google!
[11:26:44] <dabear> LindsayMac: you would see this if you just pop open firebug/webkit developer tools
[11:27:01] <MistuhKurtz> then I commented out the line of code that had the out-of-scope variable
[11:27:10] <MistuhKurtz> because it's not needed
[11:27:26] <LindsayMac> dabear:  i have firebug but am just learning how to use the debugging tools for JS
[11:27:46] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i see that and thanks.. I appreciate you explaining. as well as you dabear
[11:28:01] <MistuhKurtz> np. and yeah, definitely read up on variable scope
[11:28:06] <LindsayMac> Ohh and dabear .. remember the scroll to issue I had previously? I finally sorted out that mess
[11:28:25] <MistuhKurtz> because it's the foundation for a lot of development patterns and becomes more and more important as you become more advanced
[11:28:28] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  I am doing that now.. that is why i do hese projects. Its the best way for me to learn is to make, break, and learn why and the fix
[11:28:34] <dabear> LindsayMac: https://skitch.com/e-bjorninge/e89b5/devtools-beautified
[11:29:34] <LindsayMac> dabear:  i saw that I got the error num is not defined.. but I didnt quite know what it meant
[11:30:12] <LindsayMac> if you're curious.. this is the little project I am playing with http://bscwebhost.com/cupcart/dashboard.html
[11:32:22] <MattDunbar>  $('.SKEETSKEET').watergun(); isn't working right
[11:33:06] <MattDunbar> html: <div class="skeetskeet">sa90sd-ks90sdjasdsa</div>
[11:33:30] <MattDunbar> the letters are white, and the water gun turns them blue.
[11:33:41] <DeltaHeavy> cool
[11:33:53] <MattDunbar> I can't seem to get the water gun function setup how do I add another function
[11:34:14] <LindsayMac> MattDunbar:  you can set it up in jsfiddle so people can test and play with it to get it to work http://jsfiddle.com
[11:35:17] <Kreczor-work> LindsayMac: You mean http://jsfiddle.net
[11:35:18] <MattDunbar> Lindsay: this looks like a spam site?
[11:35:21] <dabear> LindsayMac: weren't you a php dev?
[11:35:32] <MattDunbar> skeet
[11:35:40] <dabear> LindsayMac: look at this for an explanation why num is undefined: http://pastebin.com/KCd89yq5
[11:35:41] <LindsayMac> dabear:  i am more of a php person than javascript
[11:35:46] <LindsayMac> sorry yes Kreczor-work .. thats what I meant
[11:35:47] <MattDunbar> skeet skeetskeetskeet
[11:36:09] <Kreczor-work> okay :getout: unacceptable how you forget our lord and saviour
[11:36:17] <Kreczor-work> :P
[11:36:23] <LindsayMac> haha im new.. dont shoot!
[11:36:47] <LindsayMac> dabear:  yea.. it totally makes sense. I think I just missed it because I was looking for something more complex and lost sight of the basics of coding!
[11:36:48] <jfisk87> hey guys, if i had a jquery object that was something like <div class="myDiv"><input class ="input"/></div> how could i select the inner input element?
[11:37:07] <Kreczor-work> $('.input")
[11:37:12] <Kreczor-work> $('.input')
[11:37:16] <jfisk87> ty
[11:37:31] <Kreczor-work> idk why you're calling it class="input" though and not declaring the input type
[11:37:39] <Kreczor-work> seems kinda....odd
[11:38:58] <MattDunbar> skeetskeet
[11:39:03] <cusco_> hey...
[11:39:16] <cusco_> How do I count the number of <li> inside a specific <ul> ??
[11:39:46] <cusco_> ul.children.size?
[11:39:48] <cusco_> let me try
[11:40:01] <Kreczor-work> assign each of the <ul>'s the same class and alert($('.classname'));
[11:40:09] <Kreczor-work> assign each of the <ul>'s the same class and alert($('.classname').length);
[11:40:18] <Whirl3d> wow
[11:40:19] <Kreczor-work> or maybe it's .length()
[11:40:35] <cusco_> I would rather not
[11:40:44] <cusco_> yep, .children().size() works
[11:41:06] <Whirl3d> cusco_ you would do just what you asked $("ul li").length will give you the count of the li elements within the first ul
[11:41:36] <cusco_> Whirl3d: a specific ul ?=
[11:41:58] <jeffreylevesque> does anyone know how I can target all of the dom except one div?
[11:42:01] <cusco_> $('#ul-id')
[11:42:06] <Whirl3d> The .size() method is functionally equivalent to the .length property; however, the .length property is preferred because it does not have the overhead of a function call.
[11:42:47] <Whirl3d> so however you select the ul   (by id, by index, or class, or some other way)  $("#ulid li").length
[11:43:30] <Whirl3d> jquery doesn't always work perfectly with hyphenated ID's (or at least it has historically had some problems with them) so I avoid them.
[11:43:44] <cusco_> ow
[11:43:49] <MattDunbar> 8=====)
[11:43:54] <MattDunbar> skeet skeet, water gun
[11:43:57] <cusco_> it does not have a hiphen
[11:44:16] <Whirl3d> then, I guess it's not ul-id then is it?
[11:44:18] <MattDunbar> 8======) - -
[11:44:24] <cusco_> its msgList
[11:44:27] <MattDunbar> better?
[11:44:36] <cusco_> thanks Whirl3d
[11:44:46] <Whirl3d> who is the op on duty ?
[11:44:50] <cusco_> Whirl3d: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[11:44:53] <MattDunbar> no
[11:45:07] <Kreczor-work> MattDunbar shut up
[11:45:07] <DeltaHeavy> Don't ban this IP T_T
[11:45:11] <cusco_> ahh
[11:45:12] <cusco_> nvm
[11:45:13] <cusco_> sorry
[11:45:13] <cusco_> !
[11:45:13] <MattDunbar> 8=============D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  :|  <-- you
[11:45:13] <Whirl3d> type exactly what you wrote
[11:45:21] <Whirl3d> thought so
[11:45:36] <Whirl3d> gnarf, ajpiano, eviltwin, coldhead, anybody?
[11:46:09] <ajpiano> uch i should have done that 5 minutes ago
[11:46:34] <Whirl3d> thx. Sorry to disturb you if you were busy.
[11:46:49] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[11:47:40] <Eviltwin> I just don't understand the logic
[11:47:41] <gkatsev> ajpiano: yep, I just did that in ##javascript
[11:47:54] <Eviltwin> What compels someone to spend time to do that
[11:48:13] <Whirl3d> lack of attention?
[11:48:30] <Eviltwin> Do they really get that much satisfaction out of inconveniencing peole?
[11:48:31] <Eviltwin> people*
[11:48:35] <gkatsev> Eviltwin: it's like how extroverts get energized by people, trolls get energized by conflit
[11:48:55] <Eviltwin> I've seen trolls flood for pages with no responses
[11:48:57] <gkatsev> it's unfortunate, really.
[11:48:58] <Eviltwin> And just keep going and going
[11:49:03] <Eviltwin> Eventually getting kicked
[11:49:20] <Eviltwin> With no other reaction
[11:49:37] <dankest> Eviltwin: that's actually really sad
[11:49:48] <Eviltwin> It just doesn't compute for me
[11:50:24] <Whirl3d> well, I for one am grateful that this channel has really responsive ops. It really makes it nice in here. thanks.
[11:50:37] <Whirl3d> And I love what you've done with the decorations.
[11:50:56] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: no problem, i saw it out of the corner of my eye, but i'm also on the phone
[11:51:22] <snover> ajpiano: i was enjoying it
[11:51:23] <snover> you boob
[11:51:25] <Eviltwin> If I have IRC up, a mention of my nick (or privmsg) should usually get my attention within a few minutes
[11:52:01] <Eviltwin> If someone's being an ass, don't hesitate to get my attention
[11:52:07] <Eviltwin> Takes me two commands to kick someone
[11:52:11] <snover> 8====D~~~  ajpiano etc.
[11:52:17] <snover> oops
[11:52:19] <snover> sorry socialhapy
[11:52:27] <sente> who was being an ass? i don't see anything assholeish in the recent scrollback
[11:52:39] <gkatsev> Eviltwin: make a macro or something. Could be one command. :P
[11:53:05] <ajpiano> sente: the aimless stuff about "skeet skeet" etc etc
[12:02:11] <jeffreylevesque> When I click outside the textbox, it's supposed to change the text in the box.. but it's changing regardless where I click
[12:02:13] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/7xFMY/2/
[12:03:13] <Whirl3d> jeffreylevesque, the reason your selector isn't working is that there is only one body element and your selector says:
[12:03:26] <Whirl3d> select the body element that is not ".reportProblem"
[12:04:33] <jeffreylevesque> $('body > :not(.reportProblem)') does the opposite of what I want
[12:04:49] <Whirl3d> the pseudo class selectors like :not() filter on the current element. Wheras $("body").on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); if (!targ.is(".reportProblem")) { do stuff }
[12:05:28] <Whirl3d> but this is still risky as anything not in the ".reportProblem" class will trickker the handler
[12:05:56] <Whirl3d> trigger, lol
[12:06:35] <Whirl3d> what are you actually trying to accomplish, maybe there's a better way
[12:06:52] <Parhs> hello guys
[12:06:56] <jeffreylevesque> click inside the textbox, and the text dissappears
[12:07:19] <jeffreylevesque> if you click outside the box, and nothing was typed in the box, then the default text reappears
[12:07:52] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy: Kreczor-work you should be ok
[12:07:57] <gnarf> jeffreylevesque: just use placeholder="Text to show by default"
[12:07:59] <jeffreylevesque> prob have a flag, which is set to true if the textbox is clicked
[12:08:03] <Kreczor-work> Thanks aj
[12:08:07] <DeltaHeavy> ajpiano: Can you go to #ubuntu-ops and explain this to them?
[12:08:11] <Kreczor-work> I'll try and keep him out
[12:08:11] <DeltaHeavy> It would be so much apprichated T_T
[12:08:30] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy: they are going to give precisely 0 shits about what i say and how i run #jquery :p
[12:08:32] <gnarf> jeffreylevesque: there are a few polyfils for placeholder already out there too
[12:09:06] <gnarf> explain what?
[12:09:13] <jeffreylevesque> Thanks
[12:09:16] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy: unfortunately i can't get embroiled in this brouhaha
[12:09:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: have you ever played that in WWF?
[12:09:40] <ajpiano> gnarf: apparently these two gentlemen work in the same office as the guy who was kicked, who apparently is going around IRC getting their IP banned from useful channels that they need to be in for work
[12:09:48] <ajpiano> either that, or this is a very elaborate troll
[12:09:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: lol
[12:09:58] <jeffreylevesque> gnarf++
[12:10:16] <Kreczor-work> i dont use #ubuntu at all, however deltaheavy requires it T_T
[12:10:22] <ajpiano> gnarf: never have, that would be awesome
[12:10:22] <jeffreylevesque> i could prob build placeholder, but that's so stupid of me to do so haha
[12:10:23] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[12:10:45] <Kreczor-work> on the plus side, this is more interesting then what im supposed to be doing for work
[12:11:47] <gnarf> DeltaHeavy: Kreczor-work - you guys should register two nicks, link them together, and then go to #freenode and ask if someone can set up a cloak for you, if they are resistant, explain the IP issue to them
[12:12:12] <gnarf> DeltaHeavy Kreczor-work - then your IP will be @unafilliated/yournick instead of @ip
[12:12:15] <HassanS> anyone know a website that hosts mp3 files i can use as a src?
[12:13:04] <Kreczor-work> I'll let delta handle that, he's better with asking things (smarter, nicer and more understanding)
[12:13:18] <gnarf> Kreczor-work: you'll need to do it individually
[12:13:19] <Kreczor-work> (not ass kissing delta, fuck you :P)
[12:13:29] <gnarf> he can't set up a cloak on your nickserv account
[12:13:36] <Kreczor-work> oh right
[12:16:59] <quuxman> how do I delete a list of keys from a dictionary?
[12:17:04] <quuxman> er, sorry, wrong channel
[12:24:47] <Whirl3d> href is one of the situations where we should use attr() not prop(), right? Or do we always use prop when changing the value of a markup attribute?
[12:26:49] <eph3meral> (sorry for xpost and if this is OT) so, I'm trying to implement a SlickGrid inside of a Fancybox popup but when I do so, the jQuery Datepicker plugin won't trigger, or at least, it doesn't look like it triggers (not positive, possibly it's hiding behind the fancybox I suppose). I do get the calendar icon, but when I click, "nothing happens" - I would expect to get the usual jQuery Datepicker popup - any thoughts on how to go about deb
[12:26:49] <eph3meral> ugging something like this? I've read through the slickgrid code for their Date editor object, and it doesn't look like it's doing anything particularly tricky, it's pretty short
[12:29:52] <Jimu> I've got a 50px tall div positioned absolutely with only 1 px showing at the top of my page. I assign a $.mouseenter/leave combo to this element so it slides into view if you mouse over it. It works great until I fade in the elements that precede it in the DOM - after this, the mouseleave event occurs if the mouse leaves the topmost pixel, even though the div has come down and you're still...
[12:29:53] <Jimu> ...over it if you mouse down a little bit. Any ideas?
[12:37:40] <Whirl3d> Jimu, this sounds like a perfect match for jsfiddle. Post your code (with html, css and js) to jsfiddle and share the url back here for more help.
[12:38:24] <Browser> hi
[12:38:54] <Whirl3d> eph3meral, you too, my friend. Paste your code (html, css and js) to jfiddle.net and then post the link back here.
[12:38:59] <Whirl3d> Browser, hi
[12:39:35] <eph3meral> actually, i figured it out
[12:39:45] <eph3meral> someone else had explicitly set the z-index in the stylesheet with !important
[12:39:56] <Whirl3d> right on. Good catch.
[12:41:19] <Validatorian> is there any way to access the selected element in this case? $('.allOptions').text($(this).attr('id'))
[12:41:30] <Validatorian> this isn't in the same context
[12:41:34] <Validatorian> as it's not in an .each
[12:42:03] <Whirl3d> what are you trying to do?
[12:42:34] <Whirl3d> set each of the .allOptions class text value to their ID attr value?
[12:42:48] <Validatorian> yes
[12:42:55] <Whirl3d> not without .each
[12:42:59] <Validatorian> k
[12:43:05] <Whirl3d> or map
[12:43:12] <xec_> Validatorian: you could save the selection in a var, like: $opts = $('.allOptions'); $opts.text($opts.attr('id')); assuming there is only one item with the class
[12:43:27] <Whirl3d> lol
[12:44:09] <Whirl3d> or you could set the text of all of them to the first element's id that way as well.
[12:45:37] <xec_> if there are multiple, obviously go with something like $('.allOptions').each($(this).text(this.id)); instead yeah
[12:46:47] <pachet> xec_, Validatorian: $('.foo').text(function(){return $(this).attr('id');})
[12:47:18] <Validatorian> ah, thank you pachet
[12:47:28] <Validatorian> didn't know you could inline a function in text
[13:03:30] <Jimu> Whirl3d: hm. I worked up a small test in jsfiddle and it works fine. Must be something to do with the complex stuff loading on the page
[13:07:44] <Jimu> I'm loading up a grid, and each grid cell contains two overlapping divs - one has a Highchart that loads into it, the other has a set of overlapping images of a different chart. The app then cycles by using $.fadeOut() on the image chart to show the Highchart, then $.fadeIn(). Something is happening so that my div that slides in from the top... it still works, and it's visible, but after it...
[13:07:45] <Jimu> ...slides down, and the mouse is still over it clearly, the $.mouseleave handler is firing
[13:09:41] <Jimu> Highcharts might be aggressively handling mouse events?
[13:14:54] <imachuchu> I have a group of text fields with an even tied to them through a shared class $( ".eventClass" ).focusout(function(even){ ... Is there a way of finding which exact field triggered the event from within the function?
[13:15:52] <ogk1000> is there a way to specificy a range instead of 4 items: if (event.keyCode == 37 || event.keyCode == 38 || event.keyCode == 39 || event.keyCode == 40 )
[13:16:01] <ogk1000> like if (event.keyCode == 37-40)
[13:18:04] <johnkpaul> ?inArray @ogk1000
[13:18:05] <bot-t> ogk1000, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[13:18:35] <ogk1000> so almsot seems the 4 with || or separator is fine and /or better ?
[13:18:51] <johnkpaul> ogk1000: something like var acceptableKeys = [37,38,39,40] if($.inArray(event.keyCode,acceptableKeys){}
[13:18:56] <mindtheory> hey guys, ever have it so that with an on click event associated with a div that has cursor:pointer, that the cursor changes back to an arrow after the click?
[13:19:15] <johnkpaul> mindtheory: does the click handler change any css/classes?
[13:19:28] <johnkpaul> ogk1000: what do you mean fine and/or better?
[13:19:52] <mindtheory> hm no, but mouseenter and mouseleave do
[13:20:38] <mindtheory> ahh, seems to be associated with chrome and the history
[13:22:10] <mindtheory> johnkpaul: has to do with this: http://bit.ly/SLWZyH
[13:22:46] <ogk1000> thanks johnkpaul that worked
[13:23:02] <ogk1000> and I assume your way is better practices?
[13:23:10] <mindtheory> johnkpaul: actually filed as a chrome bug: http://bit.ly/PlEIEM
[13:25:39] <johnkpaul> ogk1000: eh, I don't know if there is a standard practice, but I'd find it much more readable
[13:25:49] <johnkpaul> mindtheory: :( too bad
[13:30:28] <jeffreylevesque> hi, can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/7xFMY/4/
[13:30:52] <jeffreylevesque> when i click outside the text area, i need something to happen, alert(), change text in textarea
[13:33:31] <shoky> jeffreylevesque: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7xFMY/5/  ?
[13:34:13] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[13:34:16] <jeffreylevesque> shoky++
[13:36:40] <shoky> ogk1000: if (event.keyCode >= 37 && event.keyCode <= 40)   :\
[13:36:56] <ogk1000> :P
[13:37:09] <ogk1000> does the array slow down process at all or no way
[13:37:25] <shoky> nothing you'll notice
[13:37:49] <shoky> but if it's a range i don't see what an array is needed for
[13:38:09] <silverwind> Gotta LOVE magic numbers!
[13:38:21] <shoky> whooose
[13:38:25] <silverwind> 37
[13:38:28] <silverwind> 40
[13:38:53] <shoky> very majestic
[13:40:29] <imachuchu> any idea on my question, how to tell which field exactly was triggered on when a group of fields with a common class have a focusout method on them?
[13:41:27] <shoky> imachuchu: 'this' or 'event.currentTarget'  don't help?
[13:44:30] <imachuchu> shoky: didn't know about the 'event.currentTarget' (will look into it), as for the 'this' I'm not sure what exactly to test it against ( $(this) == $("#theField") )?
[13:44:58] <shoky> no
[13:45:03] <ProLoser|Work> is ben allman in here?
[13:45:21] <shoky> imachuchu:  if (this.id == 'theField')
[13:45:38] <imachuchu> shoky: that makes sense, thank you I'll go check it out
[13:47:25] <Crimlo> whats up my niggaz?
[13:49:56] <gaspar|work> Hey, is there a way to get all the other radio buttons with the same name as currently being selected ("siblings" of the current radio button)?
[13:51:32] <gaspar|work> This is what I have $('input:radio[name="' + $(this).attr('name') + '"]').each( function () {})
[13:59:20] <MistuhKurtz> gaspar|work, what's wrong withi that line?
[14:00:28] <gaspar|work> MistuhKurtz: I thought that there could be more awesome way of doing this - I still need to filter out the current button
[14:01:01] <MistuhKurtz>  $('input:radio[name="' + $(this).attr('name') + '"]').not(this).each( function () {})
[14:02:33] <g0z> that's pretty cool
[14:07:15] <TelFiRE> anyone know a good js that makes max-width work in browsers that don't support it?
[14:07:16] <bot-t> (716 hours ago) <miketaylr> tell TelFIRE have a nice day!
[14:08:40] <gaspar|work> MistuhKurtz .not(this) is awesome, thanks!
[14:08:46] <MistuhKurtz> np
[14:09:43] <Crimlo> am i awesome too?
[14:17:33] <Jimu> .not(this) is interesting
[14:18:59] <sente> what's .not(this) ?
[14:19:43] <MistuhKurtz> not() is a selector method to filter out elements from a jquery collection
[14:19:45] <TelFiRE> everything that's not this
[14:19:46] <MistuhKurtz> it's the inverse of filter()
[14:19:59] <MistuhKurtz> "this" is the object that owns the function
[14:20:07] <MistuhKurtz> Usually used in a callback function for an event
[14:20:25] <MistuhKurtz> well, often used...not "usually"
[14:21:40] <nFFF> inverse of filter? is it ? :?
[14:21:51] <nFFF> id say its the inverse of is()
[14:21:53] <nFFF> ?is
[14:21:55] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[14:22:03] <MistuhKurtz> ?filter
[14:22:03] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:22:07] <MistuhKurtz> ?not
[14:22:08] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[14:23:04] <MistuhKurtz> no, is() does not modify a jquery collection, it returns boolean nFFF
[14:23:22] <MistuhKurtz> filter() and not() modify a collection
[14:23:35] <sente> ah
[14:23:42] <MistuhKurtz> they modify it and then return the modified collection
[14:23:46] <nFFF> but filter isnt the inverse
[14:23:52] <nFFF> its a similiar method
[14:23:54] <MistuhKurtz> I'm guessing you can't chain is() since it returns bol
[14:23:55] <MistuhKurtz> bool.l
[14:24:06] <nFFF> except filter can filter by true or false
[14:24:20] <MistuhKurtz> but that's not what it returns
[14:24:37] <xec_> nFFF: filter does the same as .not() only opposite ;)
[14:25:11] <MistuhKurtz> that's what I said. inverse, opposite
[14:25:55] <nFFF> my bad, just read the docs I always use filter(function(){
[14:28:04] <gsingh> Is jQuery.click() triggered on mouse  down and mouse up? The docs seems to indicate so.
[14:29:07] <gsingh> So i guess my question is, is it triggers twice?
[14:29:11] <MistuhKurtz> nFFF, you can pass a func to filter()?
[14:29:24] <MistuhKurtz> gsingh, no it does not trigger twice
[14:29:48] <nFFF> MistuhKurtz I hope so cos thats the only way I seem to use it :D
[14:30:36] <gsingh> Oh I see sorry I read it wrong its triggered after a mouse down and mouse up takes place.
[14:30:46] <MistuhKurtz> haha nFFF
[14:30:49] <MistuhKurtz> thats right gsingh
[14:34:26] <tash> troll-boy: if you are still around I figured out my issue from earlier
[14:34:32] <tash> sorry I wasn't very clear in describing it.
[14:37:14] <TelFiRE> Is it possible to just manhandle images to force them to the width of their container? max-width is supposed to work this way but certain browser makers saw fit to have it not work on certain elements such as img =/
[14:37:51] <tash> can someone look at this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Nk3Tw/ ? It doesn't really have any interraction at the moment but I wanted to share the code and ask the question anyway. In my first .get() you'll see that I'm assigning data to the var scheduledHours.  When I console.log that, it logs "200" which is correct ( checked the DB to make sure ).  In my next get() I'm doing a check to see if scheduledHours is true, but it returns false.  Am I missing some basic js 
[14:38:33] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:38:43] <MistuhKurtz> I've been working with full-screen sized images on this project
[14:39:11] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, this CSS will work: width:auto; height:auto; min-width:100%; min-height:100%;
[14:39:12] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: in FF and IE, images with max-width:100% are spilling outside their containers, just ignoring the rule
[14:39:21] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[14:39:54] <TelFiRE> the LI is properly sized, obeying its %-based width. Contents inside however do not resize accordingly, they just overlap eachother and cause issues
[14:42:56] <tash> does if(var) mean "if var exists" or someting else?
[14:43:04] <TelFiRE> yes
[14:45:01] <MistuhKurtz> tash, it's looking for a "truthy" value (boolean, true/false)
[14:45:27] <MistuhKurtz> if you need to check if a var exists, you should use typeof
[14:45:34] <MistuhKurtz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2281633/javascript-isset-equivalent
[14:45:53] <TelFiRE> oh my bad.. must be confusing with some other language
[14:48:14] <tash> MistuhKurtz: I must not be doing something right
[14:48:28] <tash> can you look at the fiddle I pasted not so long ago?
[14:48:34] <tash> about 11 minutes ago
[14:48:45] <MistuhKurtz> can you post a link?
[14:48:48] <tash> yeah
[14:49:01] <tash> http://jsfiddle.net/Nk3Tw/
[14:49:14] <tash> when you have that up, scheduledHours = data is in the first .get()
[14:49:29] <tash> and when I log it to the console it displays as a number, 200
[14:49:46] <tash> which is correct ... in my next get() I want to see if that var exists
[14:50:12] <tash> or rather, if it is there and has a value
[14:50:25] <tash> that if( scheduledHours ) is returning false.
[14:55:07] <tash> MistuhKurtz: did you get that link?
[15:02:35] <tash> maybe my problem is that the var isn't global or something
[15:03:24] <tash> if you define a var at the beginning of a script like: var scheduledHours;  and then on down in the code you do something like scheduledHours = data; ( where data == 200 ) ... shouldn't I be able to used scheduledHours anywhere in the script?
[15:04:28] <qwertymk>  
[15:06:12] <Parhs> hello
[15:06:21] <Parhs> what is a good plugin
[15:06:32] <Parhs> which is a good plugin to show html in a popup ?
[15:06:53] <martin3> Hey
[15:08:36] <mklappstuhl> I'm playing with waypoints for some animation but somehow one of the two waypoints is always triggered twice: http://www.martinklepsch.org/
[15:08:58] <mklappstuhl> you can see the log output where a message gets logged everytime a waypoint is triggered
[15:09:09] <nFFF> tash, your get requests are aysnc
[15:09:22] <dabear> tash: correct. but if you are using .get, .post or any ajax, the handlers will fire async
[15:09:51] <dabear> which means scheduledHours isn't filled before some time in the future
[15:10:57] <MistuhKurtz> tash yes. Sounds like you could brush up on "variable scope" though :)
[15:11:20] <MistuhKurtz> mklappstuhl, it's from event propogation
[15:11:35] <MistuhKurtz> I had the same problem :)
[15:11:47] <MistuhKurtz> you're using waypoints twice? one on a child element, and again on its parent?
[15:12:37] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: yes
[15:13:00] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, call event.stopPropagation();
[15:13:04] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: but one child changes to position fixed at some place
[15:13:07] <MistuhKurtz> in your callback handler
[15:13:23] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: in both?
[15:13:35] <MistuhKurtz> it's only really needed in the child element's callback
[15:13:48] <MistuhKurtz> because the click event is bubbling up to the parent element
[15:14:59] <MistuhKurtz> Read up on "event bubbling" or "event propagation." It's how delegate() works, mklappstuhl
[15:15:00] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: <3
[15:15:05] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[15:15:19] <MistuhKurtz> glad I could help. That bug had me going the other day
[15:15:30] <MistuhKurtz> I asked him to include it in the docs
[15:15:37] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: I'm also on it for quite some time know
[15:15:41] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: good idea
[15:26:51] <moon1> hi
[15:28:48] <moon1> hi
[15:29:21] <jyg> ho
[15:33:48] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: Still having problems... :) After a few times scrolling up and down the parent's waypoint is always triggered twice ...
[15:34:25] <MistuhKurtz> um
[15:34:36] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not exactly sure then
[15:36:34] <mklappstuhl> MistuhKurtz: would you mind having another look at the code? :) I updated here: http://www.martinklepsch.org/
[15:38:43] <gowie> Is there some place I can download plugins since the website is down/under development?
[15:39:52] <mklappstuhl> gowie: I'd always recommend to download plugins from the authors page
[15:40:09] <mklappstuhl> gowie: I don't know if all plugin authors have one
[15:40:28] <gowie> Yeah.. that makes this a bummer.
[15:41:43] <shennyg> I'm getting an 'Object doesn't support property of method 'isArray' error in IE8 in this code: https://gist.github.com/f1b678b1ea3351c5b716#comments
[15:41:59] <mklappstuhl> gowie: I guess you already tride to find a github repo/the authors page via google..
[15:41:59] <shennyg> works fine in IE9 and normal browsers.
[15:42:34] <TelFiRE> Is there a well-liked way I can make a dropdown menu that works normally on desktop but on mobile it requires a click-to-open and click-to-close?
[15:47:11] <mklappstuhl> Is there a way with jquery waypoints to only allow callback execution if the the last waypoint triggered has not been the same?
[15:54:26] <ogk1000> TelFiRE, it does that automatically no?
[15:54:38] <TelFiRE> not Android, only iOS
[15:54:59] <TelFiRE> unless it's in a newer Android but since for whatever reason those cursed devices don't get updates for years after they're released, I gotta support the old oens
[15:55:01] <TelFiRE> ones*
[15:55:02] <ogk1000> what about IF mobile THEN use some cool js ELSE dont
[15:55:29] <TelFiRE> I can write that, I'm just wondering if there's a nicely packeged pl or script out there and someone's already done the heavy lifting
[15:56:02] <TelFiRE> since I'm sure it's pretty common issue these days
[15:56:53] <ogk1000> something like this maybe

[15:57:25] <ogk1000> obv add the doc ready
[15:57:49] <TelFiRE> is that method of detection reliable?
[15:58:01] <ogk1000> works for me ya
[15:58:19] <TelFiRE> holy crap I have never seen this before lol
[15:58:25] <TelFiRE> you're adding stuff in realtime
[15:58:28] <ogk1000> ya lol
[15:58:31] <ogk1000> thats what I use it works well
[15:59:34] <TelFiRE> it's responsive so I dont want to redirect anywhere. Wouldn't this basically just get overriden by the fact that the header is a normal link?
[15:59:57] <ogk1000> the redirect is what I use
[16:00:02] <ogk1000> instead of that just add the JS for toggle
[16:01:12] <ogk1000> give that a shot
[16:01:13] <ogk1000> bet it will work
[16:01:37] <TelFiRE> ok I'll give it a shot :) thank you!
[16:01:44] <ogk1000> yw
[16:09:23] <scalex000> troll-boy, are you there?
[16:11:22] <scalex000> hello guys I need help with code.  I dont know not work good.  no error but i need to select data  twice
[16:12:14] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/PfAiV72d
[16:12:19] <troll-boy> scalex000, I is here
[16:12:31] <troll-boy> gah pastebin again
[16:12:35] <scalex000> troll-boy, check now
[16:12:37] <troll-boy> why not jsfiddle?
[16:12:45] <scalex000> ok
[16:12:49] <scalex000> i dont kwnow this
[16:13:47] <scalex000> http://jsfiddle.net/PFPkN/
[16:14:25] <scalex000> troll-boy, http://200.88.120.178/senderform.php
[16:16:40] <scalex000> troll-boy, test by your self I need to put data twice and work autocomplete on provincia and Ciudad
[16:19:00] <troll-boy> scalex000, fixing now for you
[16:19:38] <scalex000> troll-boy, where?
[16:20:46] <troll-boy> in jsfiddle
[16:20:50] <troll-boy> I will show you when I am done
[16:21:08] <scalex000> ok
[16:21:23] <scalex000> but I try to do my best hahaha
[16:21:32] <scalex000> I start to love jquery
[16:32:58] <troll-boy> ok question scalex000
[16:33:24] <troll-boy> in one you use source : '../ajax_country.php'
[16:33:29] <troll-boy> in the other, you call var names
[16:33:35] <scalex000> troll-boy, teacher what I do wrong
[16:33:42] <scalex000> troll-boy, yes
[16:33:45] <troll-boy> why?
[16:33:53] <scalex000> troll-boy, to get all country
[16:33:59] <troll-boy> riiiight
[16:34:05] <troll-boy> but why the var names on the other
[16:34:13] <scalex000> troll-boy, remember im novice so I follow examples
[16:34:32] <scalex000> troll-boy, I put a code of this country
[16:34:41] <scalex000> troll-boy, CountryCode
[16:34:48] <troll-boy> why not source: '../ajax_states.php?country=' + countryCode,
[16:35:21] * enkomax shoots himself in the head
[16:35:48] <scalex000> troll-boy, I source all country, so when I select one I need to source the states
[16:36:32] <troll-boy> ok
[16:36:39] <troll-boy> but look at my "why not"
[16:36:49] <troll-boy> its pulling the url dynamically based off countryCode
[16:38:00] <scalex000> I not gotta it
[16:39:01] <troll-boy> ok
[16:39:11] <troll-boy> for country, you get ../ajax_country.php
[16:39:21] <troll-boy> and it automagically pulls the JSON from there
[16:39:22] <troll-boy> yes?
[16:40:01] <scalex000> yes, work perfect
[16:40:09] <troll-boy> right
[16:40:44] <scalex000> when I select one country need to fill the var with states available
[16:40:53] <troll-boy> right
[16:40:53] <scalex000> the response work perfect
[16:40:59] <troll-boy> and when you do this
[16:41:05] <scalex000> but when I type on state input
[16:41:08] <troll-boy> you pass variables around and use .get
[16:41:10] <troll-boy> HOWEVER
[16:41:13] <scalex000> puff not show nothing
[16:41:18] <troll-boy> a simpler and saner way..
[16:41:24] <troll-boy> would be to just call the url again
[16:42:00] <troll-boy> source:  '../ajax_state.php?conuntry=' + countryCode
[16:42:01] <scalex000> ahh,
[16:42:25] <troll-boy> with the +countryCode at the end, it calls the url the same way, BUT auto appends your countryCode
[16:42:27] <troll-boy> make sense?
[16:42:28] <scalex000> I thought the autocomplete not work on select event
[16:46:08] <scalex000> i need to use another function
[16:46:12] <scalex000> not autocomplet
[16:46:15] <scalex000> autocomplete
[17:01:55] <kevinquinnyo> i need to .append() the html of a div, with an ajax .load() call.  Is this possible?
[17:02:29] <kevinquinnyo> i can get the load to work, but it replaces the contents of the div with the uri i am loading
[17:02:51] <kevinquinnyo> hope i said that right, i'm new to js and jquery here
[17:03:07] <Whirl3d> yes you can
[17:03:30] <Whirl3d> you just need to set up a success handler for your ajax call
[17:05:15] <kevinquinnyo> Whirl3d: i was reading about setting up success handlers with load a moment ago, but could you clarify how this would help
[17:07:36] <Whirl3d> sure, the data returned from the ajax load is passed to the success function.
[17:08:00] <Whirl3d> so in the success function you can then use the jquery .append() method to append it to your existing content.
[17:08:24] <Whirl3d> success:function (data) { $(container).append(data);}
[17:08:27] <kevinquinnyo> Whirl3d: is this kind of a hack to allow me to call a function within a .load() call ?
[17:08:41] <Whirl3d> Not at all
[17:08:49] <Whirl3d> in fact, it's really standard
[17:09:10] <Whirl3d> it's called asynchronous for a reason
[17:09:44] <kevinquinnyo> cool, going to do some playing with that.  thanks Whirl3d
[17:10:03] <Whirl3d> Sure. When you do, if you get stuck. Post your code to jsfiddle.net
[17:10:10] <kevinquinnyo> thanks!
[17:10:12] <Whirl3d> then share the link to your code and we can help you better
[17:10:19] <Whirl3d> np
[17:11:13] <kevinquinnyo> you guys are much nicer than #bash and some others ;)
[17:12:43] <Whirl3d> thanks. In fact, I think you'll find this is the nicest group of folks you will find. People can be a little sarcastic from time to time, but you'll always find people genuinely interested in helping.
[17:13:24] <MistuhKurtz> ##cars is a bunch of meanies ;_;
[17:13:47] <Whirl3d> lol, try #css (though I gotta say that lately it has been a genuine pleasure to hang out there)
[17:13:49] <enkomax> gearheads?
[17:14:18] <MistuhKurtz> IT/networking gearheads
[17:14:30] <enkomax> odd name for a channel
[17:14:33] <MistuhKurtz> maybe sys admins are just meaner than developers :P
[17:14:56] <enkomax> i'd imagine their social lives could be even more isolated
[17:15:07] <enkomax> resulting in mean old man syndrome
[17:30:07] <MistuhKurtz> lol enkomax
[17:35:44] <sente> MistuhKurtz: i think most sysadmins prolly are meaner than devs
[17:36:03] <sente> kevinquinnyo: i've been in #bash for years, there are a lot of jerks there
[17:36:05] <Whirl3d> wait, gearheads is the IT channel ?
[17:36:05] <MistuhKurtz> maybe it's because of those lusers they're always going on about :P
[17:36:31] <sente> kevinquinnyo: they're pedantic and anal
[17:36:42] <Whirl3d> I'm serious, if you have spent a day working in IT, you have every reason to be frustrated and angry
[17:36:49] <MistuhKurtz> Haha
[17:36:56] <Whirl3d> It's a thankless job
[17:37:12] <MistuhKurtz> Yeah I've been roped into a couple phone calls to help somebody with email (we host our clients websites and sometiems mailservers)
[17:37:16] <MistuhKurtz> I understand completely.
[17:37:20] <kevinquinnyo> sente: yeah true.  but they've helped me so much over the last year i would feel bad saying anything bad
[17:37:37] <kevinquinnyo> i'm in IT :(
[17:37:41] <MistuhKurtz> Hahaha
[17:37:43] <kevinquinnyo> haha
[17:37:44] <Whirl3d> And it always lures you in with the notion that you will be someone's saviour and then hammers you down over and over
[17:37:59] <kevinquinnyo> this is true Whirl3d
[17:38:02] <sente> i've told twkm and a few others to stop being dicks, on multiple occasions
[17:38:10] <tw2113> cool, a pissing match
[17:38:18] <Whirl3d> I've done IT for nearly 20 years, including being the sysAdmin for a 7 state region of Motorola's CIG it sucks
[17:38:55] <Whirl3d> tw2113, when you graduate highschool and get out in the real world, you'll see what we are pissing about. LOL
[17:39:18] <tw2113> i'm nearing 30
[17:39:24] <kevinquinnyo> sente: it really doesnt bother me, i have no feelings to be hurt.  i just said that because i was expecting to get torn apart asking the question i asked
[17:39:24] <Whirl3d> like I said
[17:39:26] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:39:29] <sente> tw2113: but still, when you graduate highschool...
[17:39:30] <sente> ;)
[17:39:35] <kevinquinnyo> in here
[17:39:42] <tw2113> first i need to finish kindergarten
[17:39:47] * Whirl3d gives tw2113 a titty twister
[17:39:48] <tw2113> that counting and whatnot is hard
[17:39:55] <sente> kevinquinnyo: yeah, i hear ya. and i haven't called them assholes because of shit they said to me.  sometimes they just pounce too hard on a noob
[17:40:42] <kevinquinnyo> sente yeah i can see that.  especially if it's like a 12 year old who installed linux, could be quite devestating
[17:41:05] <sente> exactly. one dude recently showed them his first bash script, he was kinda proud of it
[17:41:08] <Whirl3d> maybe we should do a movie or something about the #jquery community. LOL
[17:41:09] <sente> but of course it was full of errors
[17:41:10] <sente> and yada yada
[17:41:14] <sente> and so they ate him up
[17:41:22] <sente> and so i told them to suck it
[17:41:54] <kevinquinnyo> there is something to be said for the "tough love" approach
[17:42:05] <kevinquinnyo> but yeah it does border on just mean
[17:42:14] <sente> kevinquinnyo: there's also a great concept known as "don't be a dick"
[17:42:34] <scarlet_r> how to assign radio value to input box
[17:42:35] <kevinquinnyo> Whirl3d: by the way, i made that work, pretty much doing what i want now
[17:42:36] <scarlet_r> http://pastebin.com/dXUPKcME
[17:42:48] <kevinquinnyo> sente agreed
[17:42:50] * tw2113 subscribes to the "don't be an asshole" mentality
[17:42:58] <Whirl3d> Does anybody know why noone has built a really amazing client for IRC? It seems like companies would want to capitalize on it and make custom support clients and such.
[17:43:07] <sente> kevinquinnyo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmP9XozKEV0 <-- Phil Pait's don't be a dick speech
[17:43:22] <sente> Whirl3d: irssi is pretty kickass
[17:43:35] <Whirl3d> kevinquinnyo, right on.
[17:43:48] <Whirl3d> irssi, checking it out now.
[17:44:19] <kevinquinnyo> irssi doesnt support SSL, i have to use SSL irc for work, otherwise it is a great client
[17:44:23] <sente> also weechat
[17:44:30] <imachuchu> it's what I'm using, I don't even pretend to know all of the things it can do
[17:44:42] <imachuchu> (irssi that is)
[17:44:46] <tw2113> xchat works just fine for me
[17:44:49] <sente> kevinquinnyo: can't ssh/proxy?
[17:44:53] <scarlet_r> hello jquery people..... can someone give some advice for me... sorry i'm just a newbie......i guess that problem not much difficult for a jquery man.... hehe
[17:45:21] <kevinquinnyo> sente the irc server itself uses SSL
[17:45:49] <kevinquinnyo> sente: havent thought too hard about it, there may be a hack around that
[17:45:54] * tw2113 has issues with people self-depreciating themselves to "n00bs"
[17:45:58] <sente> kevinquinnyo: so what do you use?
[17:46:17] * sente has issues with the number 2113
[17:46:25] <Whirl3d> I am actually using the Trillian IRC client and it's not really full featured, but it works pretty well. Better than MIRC
[17:46:26] <tw2113> you'll hate me then
[17:46:33] <kevinquinnyo> sente: i cant find one that i like to be honest, pidgin for the last month :/
[17:46:50] <sente> does weechat support ssl?
[17:46:51] <Whirl3d> tw2113, you are a laugh riot.
[17:47:04] <kevinquinnyo> i tried to build my own with haskell, didnt finish
[17:47:08] <tw2113> *bows*
[17:47:09] <phonebook_> i have had too much to drink and am ready to give advice
[17:47:10] <phonebook_> OR
[17:47:19] <sente> built your own irc client in haskell?
[17:47:30] <phonebook_> if anyone wants to participate in a scientifc programming expirement let me know
[17:47:31] <kevinquinnyo> no *tried*
[17:47:36] <kevinquinnyo> emphasis there
[17:47:48] <sente> kevinquinnyo: :)
[17:48:00] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, amazing irc client, see: Textual (for Mac)
[17:48:01] <kevinquinnyo> there is a haskell snippet i found and built off of
[17:48:02] <sente> phonebook_: uhh..depending
[17:48:09] <phonebook_> okay its simple
[17:48:42] <phonebook_> have you ever heard that humans can influence and or predict random number generators? there are like 20 documentaries on it made by discovery channel and science channel
[17:48:59] <kevinquinnyo> back to it, have more work to do on this thing
[17:49:05] <arnaud-> MistuhKurtz ,  I'm usin linkinus on mac which is far better than textual (with fewer bugs)
[17:49:10] <scarlet_r> hello people.... can someone spare just a little time to fix my simple script... :)
[17:49:12] <kevinquinnyo> i will probably have more questions later
[17:49:29] <MistuhKurtz> Haven't heard of linkinus arnaud-. But I already paid for Textual -_-
[17:49:41] <sente> phonebook_: nope
[17:49:43] <sente> they can't
[17:49:45] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: post it and we'll take a look
[17:49:45] <sente> i have proof
[17:49:51] <sente> RANDOM number generator
[17:49:56] <phonebook_> right
[17:50:00] <sente> phonebook_: confirmation bias...
[17:50:04] <phonebook_> but apparantly its possible
[17:50:08] <sente> lol no
[17:50:19] <phonebook_> why laughable?
[17:50:50] <phonebook_> anyway, so i made a random number generator yesterday that generates half red and half blue
[17:50:50] <sente> how isn't it laughabale?
[17:50:56] <sente> okay
[17:51:02] <scarlet_r> http://pastebin.com/dXUPKcME
[17:51:17] <scarlet_r> imachuchu thank anyway.... .:)
[17:51:19] <phonebook_> i get someone to try and make it change color, using their psychic powers, and then i try to guess what color they are trying to get it to be, based on what percent the numbers are coming out
[17:51:21] <Whirl3d> I did read parts of the book about the group dynamics simulator they ran at a wired conference where they took a room of 1500 people and using a camera and a card that had red/green sides, they filmed the crowd to do some amazing group dynamics.
[17:51:47] <sente> phonebook_: your sample size will never be big enough
[17:51:51] <MistuhKurtz> linkinus almost looks like a fork of textual
[17:51:55] <sente> for you to get any sort of reasonable result
[17:51:56] <phonebook_> its just for fun
[17:52:03] <sente> phonebook_: change it to numbres, between 1 and 1000
[17:52:16] <sente> phonebook_: sorry i decline :)
[17:52:31] <phonebook_> most people do
[17:52:34] <phonebook_> which i find weird
[17:52:39] <sente> heh
[17:52:51] <sente> phonebook_: i find it weird that you think this is possible
[17:52:55] <sente> no offense intended
[17:53:30] * phonebook_ shrugs
[17:53:30] <b-ot> \_()_/
[17:53:39] <sente> phonebook_: do you have any reputable articles you can link me about this?
[17:53:53] <phonebook_> princeton used to do stuff on it
[17:54:00] <phonebook_> there is the global consciousness project
[17:54:12] <phonebook_> also some documentaries on science and discovery
[17:54:12] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: I don't think the "input" is needed before "#textbox", assuming that "textbox" is the id of the textbox you want to insert the data into
[17:54:23] <sente> phonebook_: i mean a link i can click and read :)
[17:54:32] <phonebook_> not atm
[17:54:38] <sente> okay
[17:54:40] <phonebook_> unless you consider through the wormhole credible enough
[17:55:18] <phonebook_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIcQ5KLIiio
[17:55:19] <sente> i consider wormholes more credible than my being able to change your random number generator with psychic powers
[17:55:34] <sente> oh loh haha
[17:55:44] <scarlet_r> imachuchu.... either i remove the input in (input#textbox) or not... it always the same....
[17:55:55] <scarlet_r> the textbox not showing the radio value....
[17:56:27] <phonebook_> i dont get why everyone thinks that possibility is so insane
[17:56:44] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: also try changing "$(this).html()" to the id of the radio button (at least temporarily)
[17:56:50] <sente> phonebook_: because it makes no sense
[17:57:03] <phonebook_> youve never sensed someone looking at you?
[17:57:11] <phonebook_> or knew someone would call before they did?
[17:57:11] <sente> phonebook_: i'm so glad you mentioned that
[17:57:12] <sente> seriously
[17:57:14] <sente> yes
[17:57:24] <sente> i'm going to find something for you to read
[17:57:28] <phonebook_> no no
[17:57:30] <phonebook_> dont
[17:57:33] <phonebook_> ive thought about this a lot,
[17:57:37] <phonebook_> ill just ignore it
[17:57:40] <phonebook_> i mean not rudely
[17:57:50] <phonebook_> but as i read it i would not pay attention
[17:58:01] <sente> heh
[17:58:16] <sente> okay
[17:58:25] <sente> phonebook_: do you believe in magic?
[17:58:35] <phonebook_> of course
[17:58:36] <imachuchu> so "don't offer anything to contradict me, I won't pay attention as I've already made up my mind"?
[17:58:49] <phonebook_> if you can program an ipad, that is magic to a lot of ppl
[17:58:51] <sente> phonebook_: then this conversation is not worth happening
[17:58:53] <scarlet_r> imachuchu : i change it into  $("#textbox").val($("#radio").html());
[17:58:57] <sente> phonebook_: no, that isn't magic
[17:58:58] <phonebook_> but by the time you can program it you dont care what they think anymore
[17:58:59] <sente> that is fucking science
[17:58:59] <scarlet_r> not work :(
[17:59:18] <phonebook_> its not magic to you
[17:59:21] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: you need to give an id to the radio button first
[17:59:22] <sente> no, it's not magic
[17:59:25] <sente> because it is explainable
[17:59:26] <sente> period
[17:59:34] <phonebook_> but throw in an arduino and a kinect and your a wizard to some
[17:59:40] <sente> and its still not magic
[17:59:42] <phonebook_> ah
[17:59:51] <scarlet_r> i know... i give it #radio in input bracket
[18:00:03] <kevinquinnyo> if i have: $("#something").contents().find("div[id^=previewNEEDTHIS]")
[18:00:14] <phonebook_> eh nm.. i was going to make a point about how it gets lower and lower level to the point where you are eventually down to physics problems that are still unsolved
[18:00:25] <sente> i understand
[18:00:26] <kevinquinnyo> can i store whatever is after preview, ie - NEEDTHIS as a variable?
[18:00:41] <kevinquinnyo> i mean as the value of a variable?
[18:00:42] <phonebook_> yes
[18:00:45] <sente> phonebook_: unsolved does not mean magic
[18:00:52] <phonebook_> and if there is more than one you will get an array of them
[18:00:55] <phonebook_> true
[18:00:58] <phonebook_> i dont mean actual magic
[18:01:02] <phonebook_> which couldnt be real
[18:01:06] <sente> bingo
[18:01:08] <sente> and there fo
[18:01:13] <kevinquinnyo> phonebook_: how might i do that?
[18:01:16] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: "i give it #radio in input bracket", you mean like <input id="radio" ...>...?
[18:01:18] <phonebook_> its automatic
[18:01:23] <sente> *there for, your random number generator thing won't work
[18:01:26] <phonebook_> do a .length on your variable
[18:01:26] <sente> because that would real magic
[18:01:33] <sente> because i'm in boston, MA. i dont know where you are
[18:01:50] <sente> but my thought processes rae not going to change the bits that are used to compute the random number
[18:01:53] <sente> they just aren't
[18:01:57] <phonebook_> but according to these studies humans are able to influence random number generators ever so slightly
[18:02:01] <scarlet_r> imachuchu : yes... am i wrong.... ?
[18:02:12] <sente> phonebook_: those studies are bullshit because you can't find an actual paper
[18:02:20] <phonebook_> true enough
[18:02:26] <sente> seriously
[18:02:26] <phonebook_> but i made my own and no one will play
[18:02:29] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: no (just making sure), I do remember getting values out of radio buttons is a bit of a pain. Give me a sec to see what I use
[18:02:38] <phonebook_> do one test with me
[18:02:43] <kevinquinnyo> phonebook_: the NEEDTHIS is a different number each time, i need to store it's value for each result of find
[18:02:47] <phonebook_> if i can guess your color you must concede that it is real
[18:02:54] <sente> jesus no
[18:02:57] <Whirl3d> sente, I am not defending the claims that phonebook is making, but I have read several studies where this kind of thing happens. It's documented and though hard to believe, it's reproducable.
[18:02:59] <sente> its 50/50
[18:03:05] <phonebook_> ah
[18:03:17] <sente> Whirl3d: that is interesting.  i would love to see an actual paper
[18:03:30] <imachuchu> pics/docs or it didn't happen
[18:03:36] <sente> imachuchu++
[18:03:40] <kevinquinnyo> ha
[18:03:47] <scarlet_r> you dont have to ... i work now... sorry... i give attr to it.....
[18:03:49] <imachuchu> and by those two I mean actual studies, not facebook/twitter posts
[18:03:50] <scarlet_r> thanks....
[18:03:56] <sente> phonebook_: i will later
[18:03:58] <Whirl3d> Lemme contact my friend who is big into all this. He was just telling me about this program they used to predict trends in the stock market --turns out it predicts the future.
[18:03:59] <Whirl3d> lol
[18:04:09] <Whirl3d> I dunno if I believe that shit, but it's fun to think about
[18:04:21] <sente> technical analysis is bullshit
[18:04:23] <sente> that's where itsand
[18:04:27] <sente> *i stand
[18:04:29] <phonebook_> coudlnt you just do myArray.push( $("^='whatever']").val());?
[18:04:48] <imachuchu> yes, one can statistically pradict the future, it's the basis for modern http://pastebin.com/dXUPKcME
[18:04:58] <sente> also, for everyone: i say things very confidently, like "xyz is bullshit" and stuff, but that's just "my opinion", i'm not trying to be an asshole
[18:05:00] <imachuchu> blech, no meteorology
[18:05:03] <kevinquinnyo> phonebook_: let me play with that, thanks
[18:05:21] <phonebook_> i dont think ive ever actually helped anyone on here
[18:05:30] <phonebook_> one time i really committed to helping this guy in css
[18:05:41] <Whirl3d> In this great book SUM, this neuroscientist gives a number of great plausible explanations for what happens when we die. Just as or more plausible than any of the current religious notions. It's really really good reading for fun (all short stories)
[18:05:44] <phonebook_> and like a day later i finally figured it out and it was obvious he had no respect for me anymore
[18:06:43] <sente> Whirl3d: can you sum it up? no pun intended
[18:06:46] <phonebook_> in a few years we will have brain implants
[18:06:48] <phonebook_> maybe
[18:06:53] <phonebook_> maybe 50-100, w/e
[18:06:56] <Whirl3d> In it, one of the stories claims that we are really just a computer simulation setup way in the future when computing power is powerful enough to simulate 1 world (not an entire universe of beings) and that each of us interact to simulate life in the hopes of finding a solution to some big problem.
[18:07:03] <phonebook_> but then we will be able to communicate and move thigns with our minds
[18:07:17] <sente> Whirl3d: yeah i'm aware of that theory
[18:07:17] <Whirl3d> so as we die, they compile our data and see if they figured it out yet. It's pretty cool when you think about the ramifications.
[18:07:20] <sente> its fun to think about
[18:07:32] <phonebook_> years later those chips will become biological or we will become mechanical.... it will LOOK magic but only because we dont understand it
[18:07:38] <sente> it's stoner philosphy at its finest
[18:07:46] <phonebook_> indeed
[18:08:25] <Whirl3d> one story claims that we are just a mistake. The real living thing is a bacteria and we are a biproduct of the bacterias lifecycle. Equally as plausable as a heaven with an old man sitting at some pearly gates or some number of virgin women waiting for us when we die.
[18:08:29] <sente> Whirl3d: i had actualy heard about this book, i was talking last week about science/life/* and someone mentioned it
[18:08:42] <sente> Whirl3d: well, heh
[18:08:51] <sente> we just 'are'
[18:08:52] <sente> i think
[18:08:55] <Whirl3d> It's reallymy favorite book
[18:08:58] <sente> not a mistake or intentional
[18:09:07] <sente> Whirl3d: you should read A Short History Of Nearly Everything
[18:09:10] <sente> that is my favorite book
[18:09:16] <sente> i think you'd like it
[18:09:16] <Whirl3d> Read it!
[18:09:18] <Whirl3d> loved it
[18:09:20] <sente> yes!
[18:09:27] <sente> that bok is epic
[18:09:30] <sente> *book
[18:09:36] <Whirl3d> funny and serious at the same time.
[18:09:43] <sente> yes bill bryson is the man
[18:09:45] <scarlet_r> imachuchu : my solution seems not perpect.... http://pastebin.com/xMpN8RyY
[18:10:00] <scarlet_r> it got the wrong value for the next radio input....
[18:10:38] <phonebook_> cmon try it one time
[18:10:44] <sente> phonebook_: link me
[18:10:46] <mouzone_> sup
[18:10:50] <mouzone_> anybody wanna hear my new beat?
[18:10:57] <phonebook_> you just use your brain and i tell you the color you are thinking of
[18:11:00] <phonebook_> thats how the game works
[18:11:04] <sente> okay
[18:11:05] <sente> got it
[18:11:10] <sente> ready when you are
[18:11:35] <phonebook_> but you have to tell me when you start thinking and you have to concentrate on changing it in my random number generator for 20 seconds
[18:11:36] <Whirl3d> I'll listen mouzone
[18:11:38] <phonebook_> hold on let me start it
[18:11:46] <muzone> cool
[18:11:46] <sente> okay
[18:11:50] <sente> tell me when to start
[18:11:55] <muzone> this ones for u then
[18:12:04] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: yeah, that's pretty hackey
[18:12:07] * muzone is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/haukeland/midnight
[18:12:18] <phonebook_> ready when you are, tell me when you start
[18:12:22] <sente> now
[18:12:40] <phonebook_> oy
[18:12:46] <phonebook_> its prety much even
[18:12:51] <phonebook_> idk
[18:12:54] <sente> how surprising
[18:12:59] <scarlet_r> imachuchu : is there something i miss ?
[18:13:01] <sente> your 50/50 generator is even?
[18:13:04] <sente> cani see the sourse?
[18:13:07] <phonebook_> yes
[18:13:08] <sente> source
[18:13:17] <phonebook_> it erases the dataset every 3 seconds
[18:13:24] <phonebook_> 200 numbers a second
[18:13:33] <sente> source code plz
[18:14:15] <phonebook_> i made zero effort at doing this properly http://pastebin.com/zSM0X5qA
[18:14:43] <sente> a great way to do science
[18:14:59] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: yeah, it's the attaching to the href part instead of the actual radio button
[18:15:09] <phonebook_> sometimes you have to work hard and sometimes you have to drink hard
[18:15:26] <sente> i do both fairly well
[18:15:43] <imachuchu> hmm, so with him trying to influence a 50/50 number generator, how many picks do we need to have a statistical significance?
[18:16:02] <sente> imachuchu: i think just 1
[18:16:04] <phonebook_> with the exception of that once ive only done 5 tests on it and it got 4 out of 5 right. ... atm a human has to read it which is a problem
[18:16:07] <sente> would satisfy phonebook_
[18:16:11] <scarlet_r> imachuchu : got any idea.... ?
[18:16:15] <sente> he said earlier, if he guesses right that prooves it
[18:16:15] <phonebook_> thousands
[18:16:21] <sente> phonebook_: right
[18:16:29] <sente> phonebook_: why do you believe this?
[18:16:41] <phonebook_> idk
[18:16:42] <sente> phonebook_: is this something you just /want/ to believe?
[18:16:46] <phonebook_> seems like a high enough number
[18:16:56] <phonebook_> of course i want to believe it
[18:17:14] <phonebook_> but i am only interested in it because i saw on tv that people have been doing it and getting results
[18:17:25] <sente> phonebook_: but no one credible
[18:17:33] <phonebook_> princeton
[18:17:35] <phonebook_> hold on
[18:17:38] <phonebook_> ill do the googling
[18:17:50] <sente> okay
[18:17:58] <phonebook_> https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=princeton%20random%20number%20generators&oq=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=db8253a2a0be9195&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1680&bih=933
[18:18:01] <phonebook_> 1st result
[18:18:55] <sente> heh sorry, can you link the result
[18:18:56] <sente> or bitly
[18:19:03] <sente> my irssi, despite being a good irc client, is failing
[18:19:05] <sente> at that long url
[18:19:07] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: hmm, in hindsight I'm not sure how useful this is: http://pastebin.com/ANgQZvVS
[18:19:39] <phonebook_> theres this one but it looks like its from 1995 http://noosphere.princeton.edu/
[18:20:08] <phonebook_> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project#Criticism
[18:21:37] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: my code attaches to the class, but you definetly could attach instead to the id of the radio selector then set the val of the textbox with $("#textbox").val($("#radioId").val()) I think
[18:22:27] <scarlet_r> imachuchu : http://pastebin.com/ANgQZvVS i'm sorry i'm not smart enough to understand what are u trying to intend  :8
[18:22:30] <sente> phonebook_: if the data was beyond a reasonable a doubt, i'd have heard about this shit 100x
[18:22:32] <phonebook_> not sure on straight html but with jquery mobile you have to use .attr("checked, "checked")
[18:22:46] <sente> phonebook_: referring to the #criticism link
[18:22:55] <phonebook_> yeah its the same old stuff
[18:23:07] <phonebook_> im not saying its real
[18:23:13] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: and I'm not knowledgable enough to explain it well :p
[18:23:24] <phonebook_> im just saying the idea of studying it is cool
[18:23:42] <imachuchu> phonebook_: the idea of being payed to study it is cool
[18:23:43] <sente> i mean, its kinda cool
[18:24:00] <scarlet_r> imachuchu.... i just i miss some selector rules.... :(
[18:24:35] <scarlet_r> when using this.... $("#textbox").val($(thir).html());
[18:24:38] <scarlet_r> it works...
[18:24:39] <scarlet_r> but...
[18:24:51] <scarlet_r> i return all the input bracket...
[18:25:00] <scarlet_r> i just need the value inside the bracket....
[18:25:04] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: the title of that piece is "not really that useful", it's a paste of what I am using (which is only somewhat like your problem)
[18:26:05] <scarlet_r> for my problem... i intent to create a popup tree to choosing category... a lot category... and user just click the radio to assign to DB...
[18:27:56] <sente> phonebook_: you should read phil plait's stuff on bad science
[18:28:11] <sente> phonebook_: and in general, skepticism
[18:28:22] <sente> phonebook_: i would be happy to link you to good sources
[18:28:32] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: try just when the button is pressed to read which value was selected with console.log( $("#radioId").val()) to see what exactly you are getting before you try to input it into a text box
[18:28:36] <phonebook_> i love science
[18:28:38] <sente> i'm very well read on the subject, i was actually going to go to TAM but had to cancel because something came up
[18:28:42] <phonebook_> it was my favorite subject
[18:28:44] <sente> TAM = the amazing meeting
[18:28:45] <phonebook_> im not against science
[18:28:48] <imachuchu> scarlet_r: also wouldn't you want a drop down box for database selector?
[18:28:52] <phonebook_> or the scientific method
[18:29:06] <sente> it's a big circle jerk for science and rationalists
[18:29:33] <phonebook_> but so rational that they miss the point and actually become stupid?
[18:29:51] <scarlet_r> tree category... when i using drop down... it will fully fill the entire page....
[18:29:51] <phonebook_> or
[18:30:08] <sente> hardly
[18:30:14] <phonebook_> okay go ahed
[18:30:16] <scarlet_r> so i choose somekind of a dialog box....
[18:31:05] <sente> phonebook_: hrm?
[18:31:39] <phonebook_> you said link to good sources
[18:31:42] <sente> ah
[18:31:59] <sku11knight> hi guys, sorry to ask a noob question, but google is failing me > <. i'm trying to put a variable as the value for the .click script and i'm wondering if this syntax is wrong because it's not really working > >. $($pclick.val()).click(
[18:32:14] <sente> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCofmZlC72g
[18:32:31] <phonebook_> this makes zero sense  $($pclick.val()).click(
[18:32:35] <phonebook_> everything about it is wrong
[18:32:57] <sku11knight> here let me get you the full script, sorry.
[18:33:03] <imachuchu> sku11knight: do you mean $("#pclick").click( ?
[18:33:23] <phonebook_> ah, youtube, nice
[18:33:26] <phonebook_> okay, watching now
[18:33:42] <sente> http://web1.boisestate.edu/econ/lreynol/web/PDF/short_3_knowing.pdf
[18:34:39] <sku11knight> imachuchu : http://jsfiddle.net/sku11knight/tduyb/
[18:35:06] <phonebook_> dear god
[18:35:07] <sente> http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/popper-logic-scientific-discovery.pdf
[18:35:08] <phonebook_> okay the problem is
[18:35:47] <phonebook_> you cant implicitly use the id of an element as a jquery object. e.g.  $pclick = $(".printerclick").attr('id'); ----> $($pclick.val()).click(function(){
[18:36:19] <sku11knight> crap. so what i'm trying to do isn't possible?
[18:36:31] <phonebook_> idk, im workign it now, someone will probably beat me to it
[18:36:45] <sku11knight> also phonebook_ you're cracking me up.
[18:36:48] <rmurphey> sku11knight: it seems like you're trying to bind a click event to the element with a class of .printerclick?
[18:37:26] <rmurphey> more to the point, in plain english, what are you trying to do?
[18:38:10] <phonebook_> i think this is it http://jsfiddle.net/tDuYB/1/
[18:38:55] <sku11knight> I have a php script that's generating different divs and they all share that class in common but their ids are unique, so i'm trying to get the unique ids and change specific divs without changing the other ones.
[18:40:11] <phonebook_> $.each($(".myClass"), function() { $(this).css("border", "5px solid Red;"} );
[18:42:12] <phonebook_> sente, he just said it was shown that people have been shown to have an ability to psychicly influence physical events
[18:42:37] <sku11knight> thank you phonebook, that helped a lot
[18:42:51] <sente> sam harris?
[18:43:00] <phonebook_> yeah!
[18:43:22] <sente> heh at what time? i'll have to watch it later
[18:43:27] <sente> phonebook_: my stance is still 100% bullshit
[18:43:34] <sente> i can't watch now
[18:44:16] <phonebook_> ...im paraphrasing, of course
[18:44:39] <phonebook_> 9:..05?
[18:45:25] <sente> phonebook_: heh ill have to watch it later
[18:45:29] <sente> and i might email him
[18:45:32] <phonebook_> im just kidding
[18:45:36] <sente> okay lol
[18:45:42] <sente> i haven't seen that video in awhile
[18:45:48] <sente> ive communicated with him before though
[18:46:16] <phonebook_> hes too boring for me
[18:46:19] <sente> and i was going to send him a very wtfh email
[18:46:26] <sente> phonebook_: heh, you might learn something though
[18:46:31] <phonebook_> true
[18:47:51] <phonebook_> i sense some irony though
[18:48:27] <scarlet_r> i still asking for voluntary .. :D
[18:50:03] <jonkersjoe> hmmm #javascript requires an invitation ? since when ?
[18:53:15] <sente> jonkersjoe: ##javascript, not #javascript
[18:53:33] <jonkersjoe> oh that's right
[18:53:34] <jonkersjoe> thanks
[19:18:40] <scarlet_r> broke up the silent... hello all...
[19:18:47] <scarlet_r> back to my question....
[19:18:48] <jonkersjoe> hi
[19:19:17] <scarlet_r> can someone help me out... for my script... got 3 hours here :(
[19:20:31] <jonkersjoe> you may want to ask it again
[19:22:02] <scarlet_r> http://pastebin.com/6jXLs80N
[19:22:11] <scarlet_r> the input not return the radio value....
[19:22:41] <scarlet_r> i have already read the reference, searching stackoverflow.... but... still got no ideas
[19:23:29] <jonkersjoe> are you trying to get the input value or the radio value
[19:23:30] <jonkersjoe> ?
[19:23:38] <scarlet_r> yes....
[19:24:55] <jonkersjoe> which one ?
[19:25:28] <scarlet_r> the one which user check it....
[19:25:58] <scarlet_r> my previous script :  $("#textbox").val($(":radio").attr("value"));
[19:26:18] <scarlet_r> but it could return same value if i add new radio....
[19:26:32] <scarlet_r> although the radio has different value...
[19:30:51] <jonkersjoe> scarlet_r:  is this what you are looking for ? http://jsfiddle.net/prad/AQeF4/ i don't really understand what you are trying to do
[19:31:52] <jonkersjoe> scarlet_r:  a couple of things with your code, you have two inputs of type radio which both have the same id, you need to make the id unique
[19:32:30] <jonkersjoe> and not sure why you are wrapping it in a tag
[19:32:51] <scarlet_r> it is being complicated if i create different id for the radio...since i would write it with php looping...
[19:32:56] <scarlet_r> and.....
[19:33:07] <jonkersjoe> well, you need to
[19:33:36] <scarlet_r> i guess i have to write the jquery script for every pieces of the looping of id...
[19:33:36] <jonkersjoe> otherwise remove the Id
[19:34:47] <scarlet_r> the simple thing is i change the $("#textbox").val($(":radio").attr("value"));
[19:35:02] <scarlet_r> to $("#textbox").val($(this).html());
[19:35:16] <scarlet_r> but.. it would return all the html syntax....
[19:35:37] <scarlet_r> that's ok... but i need to remove some class to get the id...
[19:35:42] <scarlet_r> is that possible... with jquery
[19:35:49] <jonkersjoe> or if you want to get a collection of the radio use a class <input type="radio" val="asd" class="myradios" /> and select it as $(".myradios")
[19:37:37] <scarlet_r> i'm try it...
[19:37:47] <jonkersjoe> sorry gotta run :/
[19:38:17] <scarlet_r> thanks... got..
[19:38:19] <scarlet_r> it...
[19:38:32] <scarlet_r> i know it's so easy... but i just not familiar with jquery...
[19:38:36] <scarlet_r> thank... jonkersjoe
[19:38:39] <scarlet_r> :)
[19:39:13] <jonkersjoe> that's ok, np
[20:24:52] <scathen^C> anyone around?
[20:25:31] <scathen^C> trying to get position data for some objects, but am always getting zero. if i put the code in a click method i get the correct positions???
[20:26:02] <runvnc> put the code in a jsfiddle
[20:27:49] <scathen^C> im literally just logging position().left to the console
[20:27:53] <scathen^C> it always returns 0
[20:28:37] <runvnc> put it in a jsfiddle
[20:29:18] <runvnc> If it says 0 then it is 0
[20:29:37] <runvnc> there is also offset()
[20:29:43] <scathen^C> but if i put the same line of code inside a click function it returns 650
[20:29:56] <runvnc> which line of code
[20:30:01] <runvnc> I said put it in a jsfiddle
[20:30:09] <runvnc> this is different
[20:30:16] <runvnc> what is the line of code
[20:30:30] <runvnc> your this is going to be the element you clicked inside of the click
[20:30:43] <scathen^C> console.log($('.user-tile').first().position().left);
[20:30:44] <runvnc> it won't be that outside of it. might be the window
[20:31:09] <runvnc> put it in a jsfiddle
[20:31:21] <scathen^C> it is a massively complicated page
[20:31:24] <runvnc> it might be that there is no .user-title.first()
[20:31:56] <runvnc> did you try console.log($('.user-title'))
[20:32:03] <runvnc> did you try using the element inspector
[20:32:26] <scathen^C> i'll rephrase the question. i want to do something to an element based on its position from its parent. is it correct to put this in $(document).ready()? or elsewhere?
[20:33:38] <runvnc> it should work in ready
[20:33:46] <runvnc> maybe there is no user-title or user-title first
[20:33:52] <scathen^C> there is
[20:33:52] <runvnc> at the point where you call it
[20:34:15] <scathen^C> i am actually calling it in an each() and getting a value logging for each item
[20:34:15] <runvnc> whats the url
[20:34:19] <scathen^C> its local
[20:34:27] <scathen^C> nvm, ill keep hacking
[20:34:42] <runvnc> youre calling it in an each? that's totally different from what you said
[20:36:25] <runvnc> I think you should double check that (this) is what you think it is in your each, double check that .user-title is what you think it is, double check that there is a .first, and then output all of the info you can about that element, including offset.  also try inspecting it
[20:41:08] <oojacoboo> hey guys, so, I have a sortable list where I have also, a contentEditable object
[20:41:37] <oojacoboo> I'm looking to disable the sortable behavior if the contentEditable object is clicked, for some reason the sortable function interferes here
[20:41:59] <oojacoboo> I'm doing now var.click(function(e) { return false });
[20:42:09] <oojacoboo> but that's not really getting me anywhere, anyone have any ideas?
[20:42:42] <runvnc> is there a dragstart option or sortstart
[20:42:52] <oojacoboo> mmm, prob is
[20:42:53] <runvnc> that maybe could check a global
[20:43:08] <oojacoboo> yea, def a good look
[20:43:10] <runvnc> and if the global is set it returns false or somehow makes it not start sorting
[20:43:39] <oojacoboo> runvnc, you say the global, can you explain what you mean by that?
[20:44:17] <runvnc> well maybe not a global sorry
[20:44:30] <oojacoboo> runvnc, http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable#events
[20:44:35] <oojacoboo> I'm using start:
[20:45:09] <runvnc> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2995329/if-i-do-jquery-sortable-on-a-contenteditable-items-i-then-cant-focus-mouse
[20:45:18] <oojacoboo> maybe I need to define the placeholder object?
[20:45:52] <oojacoboo> lol, at that perfect SO
[20:45:56] <oojacoboo> ><
[20:46:18] <oojacoboo> runvnc, cheers
[20:46:25] <runvnc> yay google
[20:46:34] <oojacoboo> I did my google :/
[20:47:07] <runvnc> I know I was just happy that google was able to solve that problem for me
[20:47:14] <runvnc> brain is a little dull today
[20:47:21] <oojacoboo> heh
[20:48:06] <oojacoboo> ahhh, that's genius, works a dream
[21:13:22] <Guddu> How can i have some JS Code to execute each time when a page loads (With Dynamic Content) after a form submission?
[21:13:53] <Guddu> Please guide.
[21:22:21] <Guddu> So no one can help?
[21:48:32] <sente> have you looked on stackoverflow?
[21:48:45] <sente> i'm fairly certain you'd find an answer there
[21:51:36] <Whirl3d> Guddu, it's a really big request, don't you think? You can add a script to the beginning of each loaded content in the head that says $(document).ready(function () {do stuff()}) but to ask someone to explain how to handle form submission, dynamic page loading and then how to append a script to dthose dynamic pages...only if I can design the shit too.
[21:52:25] <phonebook_> i was booted from philosophy for dominating the channel
[21:52:31] <phonebook_> it wasnt hard...
[21:52:38] <phonebook_> the dominating part
[21:52:48] <phonebook_> finding anyone worth talking to was VERY hard
[21:52:50] <Guddu> Whirl3d, I only asked how to invoke a JS at page load. I don't know how you got the remainder?
[21:52:54] <sente> phonebook_: i'm skeptical
[21:53:01] <sente> the way i imagine it played out is like this:
[21:53:03] <phonebook_> lol
[21:53:05] <Guddu> And i got the answer. Thanks
[21:53:12] <Whirl3d> Well, then you got it yw
[21:53:15] <phonebook_> save you
[21:53:28] <sente> you join the channel and talk about your consciousness magic
[21:53:47] <Whirl3d> but when you come back and want to know the rest of the answers, let me know and I'll try to help. Your request was pregnant with unspoken detail.
[21:53:48] <sente> they tell you, 'no, not really' in more ways than one
[21:54:03] <sente> you disagree with them, because
[21:54:31] <sente> these two events are repeated atleast a few times
[21:54:40] <sente> they give up and boot you
[21:54:47] <sente> yes?
[21:55:05] <phonebook_> ....
[21:55:15] <sente> Whirl3d: "pregnant with unspoken detail" - great phrase :)
[21:55:18] <phonebook_> it was more like the followig sequence of events
[21:55:29] <phonebook_> i say something
[21:55:38] <phonebook_> a bunch of nonsense
[21:55:44] <phonebook_> [nonsense]
[21:55:58] <Whirl3d> thanks. it's one of those things that when you see: With Dynamic Content in parentheses, you know there's a virtual bun in the oven
[21:56:00] <phonebook_> i counterpoint being nice to how bad the [nonsense[ was
[21:56:05] <phonebook_> ]
[21:56:07] <phonebook_> etc
[21:56:56] <phonebook_> a couple hours later after i have run out of people to talk to an op says i have been dominating the channel even though no one would have been saying anything in there anyway and in fact i probably increased the philisophical discussion
[21:56:59] <phonebook_> sry
[21:57:03] <phonebook_> too serious
[21:57:13] <Whirl3d> phonebook, I'll tell ya what. I left this room to run an errand an hour ago and you were spamming then and are still spamming now. If you need help with a jquery problem or want to discuss jquery, we're here for ya. Otherwise, we've been polite and entertained you now quit with the spam
[21:57:31] <phonebook_> wtf
[21:57:52] <phonebook_> ppl are really sad
[21:57:55] <phonebook_> maybe i can help YOU?
[21:58:01] <phonebook_> if that is imagineable
[21:58:16] <Whirl3d> certainly. And if I were in your channel, I would be grateful for your help
[21:58:16] <Guddu> Whirl3d, :-)
[21:58:37] <phonebook_> this is why i turn off my internet
[21:58:45] <phonebook_> okay...
[21:58:47] <sente> phonebook_: can you show me ##philosophy backlog? i'm genuinely curious
[21:58:57] <phonebook_> yeah why not
[21:59:09] <phonebook_> i dont even care if im wrong, you asked for it
[21:59:14] <Whirl3d> sente, you are provoking the situation, my friend.
[21:59:15] <phonebook_> give me a sec
[22:00:49] <phonebook_> http://pastebin.com/GtJQZqWd
[22:00:55] <phonebook_> not sayign i wasnt being somewhat of an ass
[22:01:05] <phonebook_> just sayig if i had ppl to talk to that werent dumb as shit..
[22:01:52] * Whirl3d is dumb as shit
[22:02:02] * tw2113 concurs
[22:02:05] <tw2113> jk
[22:02:18] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:02:50] <Whirl3d> nobody uses the old{{{{{tw2113}}}} syntax any more, do they
[22:03:38] <sente> Whirl3d: i know, i am technically 'provoking the situation', sorry
[22:03:40] <tw2113> stop hugging me
[22:04:01] <sente> personally i enjoy these 'situations' now and then. but i agree #jquery is a friggin odd place for it
[22:04:06] <phonebook_> that syntax is hard to remember, how many brackets?
[22:04:23] <phonebook_> it looks like 5
[22:05:25] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I like em too. That's why I felt like nobody was doing anything wrong, but it makes it hard for people to ask a question in a busy channel that's completely off topic. No hard feelings, just didn't want to alienate others who need help is all
[22:08:04] <sente> yeah i hear ya
[22:08:11] <phonebook_> philosophy is never on topic
[22:08:16] <RonWhoCares> I have setup 5 <button> beside the "Name Record" label.  I intend for them to trigger a JQuery ajax.  Instead they reload the page.  How do I stop the webpage from being reloaded and these buttons only trigger the JQuery   (I have only setup for Member Services Account so far)   http://jsfiddle.net/Gkazc/
[22:08:23] <phonebook_> its always about what regulars had for lunch or some insanly academic bs
[22:08:44] <sente> heh, phonebook_, those two things are like polar opposites
[22:08:54] <phonebook_> its never about actual thought or knowledge.... if philosophy is about the love of knowledge, jquery is mroe about philosophy than philosophy is about philosophy
[22:09:11] <phonebook_> i know they are.... its not my fault that is what they talk about
[22:09:12] <sente> phonebook_: ah you mean ##philosophy
[22:09:18] <phonebook_> just one
[22:09:23] <sente> i'm not familiar with the channel so i can't comment
[22:10:29] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, so right now you click "memberServicesAccount" and it reloads the page?
[22:10:45] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: Yes
[22:11:22] <Whirl3d> here are a couple of things to consider:   first of all you are selecting the button by id...no need to call the .attr("id") function inside, you know the id.
[22:12:19] <Whirl3d> If you later setup the button handlers without explicit ID's calling each one, you then would want to do it the way you did. Is that reasonable?  Now as for your page refresh issue:
[22:12:50] <Whirl3d> have you considered using $.ajax
[22:13:31] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: I am still new at this.  I have seen this, but I haven't grasped it yet
[22:13:37] <Whirl3d> sure it's just a shortcut syntax, but I think it makes it clearer what's happening in the background.
[22:13:54] <RonWhoCares> I am open to using it Whirl3d
[22:14:32] <Whirl3d> Well,  $.post is a shortcut to $.ajax (url, {type:"post", data:data, success:function (data) {do stuff here}});
[22:15:12] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:15:17] <Whirl3d> in the success handler, you will get past the data from the url you specified. Then you can do whatever you want with that data without having to refresh the page
[22:16:30] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:16:33] <RonWhoCares> I am with you so far
[22:17:05] <Whirl3d> so lemme change your fiddle a little and see where we stand. brb
[22:17:58] <Whirl3d> do you have a script on your server called ledger_account_source_update.php?
[22:18:13] <Whirl3d> and what variables is it expecting?
[22:19:04] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:19:12] <RonWhoCares> Yes I have a script named this
[22:19:32] <RonWhoCares> What it is expecting is a number 1 to 5
[22:19:48] <RonWhoCares> But I haven't set this up with the buttons
[22:19:57] <RonWhoCares> I want Member Services Account to be 1
[22:20:00] <Whirl3d> so you would send:    script.php?____=1 for example
[22:20:09] <RonWhoCares> sure
[22:20:10] <Whirl3d> what is ____
[22:20:15] <RonWhoCares> oh
[22:20:29] <RonWhoCares> that variable is     selectedvalue
[22:20:39] <Whirl3d> ledger_account_source_update.php?selectedvalue=1
[22:20:46] <RonWhoCares> yes
[22:20:53] <Whirl3d> cool. brb
[22:21:29] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d:    The output from this is a bunch of   <option value="###">Description</option>
[22:22:16] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: I want to remove the current <option> list from   #account_reference   and replace it with the results of this
[22:25:12] <Whirl3d> You realize of course that there are currently no options in the account_reference dropdown
[22:26:18] <Whirl3d> I think that usually, you would use one or the other.  5 buttons to select the account_reference is fine, but then you don't also need the select option for account_reference.
[22:26:53] <Whirl3d> or does the PHP script lookup a specific account and place it in the account_refernce field?
[22:27:00] <RonWhoCares> correct
[22:27:14] <Whirl3d> in which case, it might be best to just make it an input field that is uneditable for right now.
[22:27:15] <RonWhoCares> The results of this are to populate the select
[22:27:24] <Whirl3d> with one option
[22:27:37] <RonWhoCares> There is more than one way to do this
[22:27:44] <RonWhoCares> I am not set of 5 buttons
[22:27:53] <RonWhoCares> if you can show me a better way I am willing to learn it
[22:28:00] <RonWhoCares> and use it in my future programming
[22:28:14] <Whirl3d> I'm just trying to figure out what you are doing. Not passing judgment, really.
[22:28:50] <RonWhoCares> The results of the Name Record Source are to populate the  Name <select>
[22:29:11] <RonWhoCares> the output of the PHP file is <option value="">description</option>
[22:29:12] <Whirl3d> so the <option value='####'>Description</option> is what your php returns. Is it possible that you would do three or four transactions of different types and so the second time it would add another option?
[22:29:47] <RonWhoCares> I don't understand your question
[22:29:56] <RonWhoCares> Oh I see
[22:30:05] <RonWhoCares> The transaction could be of any of the 5 sources
[22:30:11] <RonWhoCares> it is sporatic
[22:30:17] <Whirl3d> but only 1 of the five sources.
[22:30:25] <RonWhoCares> Correct
[22:30:38] <RonWhoCares> This is creating a ledger entry
[22:30:43] <Whirl3d> Let's just try this then and we canchange it if needed:
[22:30:49] <RonWhoCares> It is recording a single transaction
[22:30:54] <RonWhoCares> ok; thank you
[22:31:08] <Whirl3d> Lets change the account_reference field to a simple text input that is uneditable.
[22:31:17] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:31:36] <RonWhoCares> You are going to update the JSFiddle
[22:31:44] <RonWhoCares> and then when it works I will change my code, am I correct?
[22:31:51] <Whirl3d> So, to select the account_reference. you click one of the 5 buttons on the top,can you change the PHP result?
[22:31:59] <Whirl3d> is it your PHP script?
[22:32:19] <RonWhoCares> Yes it is my PHP script
[22:32:24] <RonWhoCares> Yes, I can change the output
[22:32:49] <Whirl3d> so lemme ask this: does it just change the button clicked id into a value from 1 to 5?
[22:33:11] <RonWhoCares> So far
[22:33:13] <RonWhoCares> But
[22:33:28] <RonWhoCares> the PHP has a "switch ( $selectedvalue ) {
[22:33:42] <RonWhoCares> I could just change them to match the ID's   and no longer use 1 to 5
[22:33:45] <Whirl3d> why php for that?
[22:34:07] <RonWhoCares> The name records are stored in 5 different tables
[22:34:17] <RonWhoCares> there is a specific database query for each table
[22:35:04] <Whirl3d> but the php script that returns the option currently just looks it up using the switch(selectedvalue) and returns the option, right?
[22:35:05] <RonWhoCares> This is why I am asking the user to specify who the business transaction was with
[22:35:16] <RonWhoCares> You are correct
[22:35:51] <RonWhoCares> I can change the "CASE #" to match the ID
[22:35:51] <Whirl3d> wait wait wait. So if I click Member Services Account, I could get back 10 different options, to select under "name"
[22:36:13] <Whirl3d> and presumably the same for Ledger Account
[22:36:15] <Whirl3d> etc.
[22:36:16] <RonWhoCares> Correct Whirl3d
[22:36:34] <Whirl3d> I though you could only get back ONE option, not multiple options,.
[22:36:41] <Whirl3d> that makes more sense now
[22:37:00] <RonWhoCares> So I have a list of suppliers, a list of the membership
[22:37:02] <RonWhoCares> you are catching on
[22:37:05] <RonWhoCares> :)
[22:37:24] <Whirl3d> just change the .val(data) to append(data) and see if it works
[22:37:29] <Lucky--> bahahahahahahhahaha I want this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-cT6mra1Pw (yes a 2jz-gte (MKIV toyota supra twin turbo engine) powered boat
[22:38:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Gkazc/2/
[22:38:51] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: I want it to replace the existing set of <option>'s   if the user clicked one incorrectly
[22:39:08] <Whirl3d> then use .html(data)
[22:40:31] <RonWhoCares> am I correct that you made no changes to the form
[22:40:55] <RonWhoCares> just the script
[22:40:59] <Whirl3d> only in the success handler where you had .val(data).... you want .html(data)
[22:41:12] <Whirl3d> I just formatted it so I could see what was up with it.
[22:41:56] <Whirl3d> I literally pasted your source html into my ide and said APPLY SOURCE FORMATTING and then copied it back.
[22:42:14] <Whirl3d> so it would have more legible spacing
[22:42:39] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:42:48] <RonWhoCares> It is still re-loading the web page Whirl3d
[22:45:29] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Gkazc/4/
[22:47:00] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:47:02] <RonWhoCares> oine sec
[22:48:25] <RonWhoCares> It is still doing it
[22:48:47] <RonWhoCares> (reloading the web page, not treating this as a jquery ajax
[22:49:00] <Whirl3d> I think somethine else must be going on....can you pm me the link to the live site?
[22:49:10] <Edler> Where can i find an online demo
[22:49:14] <Edler> about the Sonata Bundles ?
[22:51:03] <bindi> hey juha_, you here? :P
[22:51:26] <bindi> juha_: nvm
[22:53:16] <Whirl3d> Edler, I am not sure what you mean by Sonata Bundles
[22:53:46] <Edler> http://sonata-project.org/bundles/
[22:53:52] <Edler> mostly the sonata page bundle
[22:54:11] <Edler> or the sonata admin bundle
[22:54:14] <Edler> can't find any demo online
[22:54:33] <sente> Whirl3d: /wg 72
[22:55:02] <sente> whoops
[23:20:01] <eip56> Hai
[23:39:43] <AliG1000> Hi - I have some jQuery & Ajax on my page at http://bus.cr/index2.php
[23:40:11] <AliG1000> Using the form, I am able to search the database e.g.Moravia
[23:41:16] <AliG1000> I can then hit the submit button and send the company name to a new page within the url as a GET
[23:41:38] <AliG1000> but, I'd like to send the record ID in the GET also
[23:42:44] <AliG1000> I already retrieve the ID - and I have tried to put it in a hidden field - it just isn't being passed to the GET
[23:43:03] <AliG1000> and I'm not sure if it is getting sent to that hidden field in the first place
[23:43:12] <AliG1000> anyone have to to take a look?
[23:44:44] <AliG1000> you can see what is being retrieved from the database here: http://bus.cr/autocomplete-search.php?term=moravia
[23:49:32] <Back2Basics> to my knowledge a GET doesn't POST anything from form fields (hidden or not) you need to include info in the get URL for anything to be passed that way.
[23:50:36] <Browser> Good morning
[23:51:27] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: ignore me I'm falling asleep.  (just read the last post)
[23:52:36] <AliG1000> @Back2Basics - well, wake up and see if you have any suggestions! :)
[23:54:26] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: can you post it using http://jsfiddle.net/
