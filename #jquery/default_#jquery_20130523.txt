[00:06:27] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:22:05] <redner> yoooooo
[00:29:12] <Lucaszz> hi
[00:29:21] <Lucaszz> how to detect ANY CHANGE
[00:29:24] <Lucaszz> inside input
[00:29:39] <Lucaszz> including cuting, pasting
[00:37:30] <joobie> guys, anyone know why with http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/36/ I can't click the first dot on the initial page load?
[00:42:47] <Cork> joobie: slideId = 0
[00:43:11] <Cork> joobie: http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/37/
[00:44:49] <s3d_matt> Morning All
[00:45:51] <joobie> ahh thanks Cork :)
[00:46:03] <joobie> Cork, i got 1 more bug with my code
[00:46:44] <joobie> it is to do with stop() used in the two mouseenter / mouseleave events (around line 47)
[00:47:07] <joobie> if you hover over the div and out very quickly over n over
[00:47:15] <s3d_matt> Couldn't anyone have a 10 second glance at this.  Its a countdown timer, but for some reason the author hasn't made setting time a setting when you create th countdown object.  This paste has the bit in it: http://pastebin.com/M7K9VZmG
[00:47:23] <joobie> you'll see eventually the arrows will become semi opaque and just sit there
[00:47:23] <s3d_matt> Ha, Could, rather than couldn't!!
[00:47:40] <joobie> im not sure why this is happening.. stop should be canceling the previous fadeout/fadein and then starting a new event to fadein / fadeout
[00:47:42] <joobie> any idea why?
[00:49:09] <seutje> joobie: passing false as the second argument to stop() causes it to not jump to the end
[00:49:20] <seutje> so the current point will be considered the start
[00:50:45] <joobie> seutje, which is sorta the effect i want - if the fadeOut is say 50% through, i want the fadeIn to start fading in from that point ideally
[00:51:31] <joobie> .. it'll give a smoother feel, in theory.. but this thing is sorta stalling
[00:51:35] <seutje> wait, ur actually using fadeout and fadein, my bad
[00:51:48] <seutje> this shouldn't be the problem, prolly something else then
[00:52:12] <joobie> im thinking JQuery bug - as in the stop() is stopping my fadeIn after by accident
[00:52:18] <joobie> i can't see what else it could be
[00:54:53] <redner> anyone here able to help with some ajax stuff?
[00:59:15] <oksushi> WouterDS: my next question would usually be "Does the issue persist with JavaScript disabled?‚Äùbut‚Ä¶
[00:59:19] <oksushi> gah
[00:59:22] <oksushi> apologies all
[01:01:44] <seutje> joobie: seems to be a problem with fadeout/fadein, when I do the animations manually, it seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/40/
[01:03:07] <joobie> seutje, good test case
[01:03:10] <joobie> .. and nice find
[01:07:24] <joobie> seutje, what do you think of the slider btw?
[01:07:49] <joobie> seutje, i couldnt find one that could give me the specifics i wanted so ended up doing my own
[01:08:41] <seutje> joobie: well, there's quite some repetition going on and it doesn't seem all that reusable
[01:08:44] <joobie> seutje, also wanted it to scroll through the slides up to the last on first load adn then stop? any ideas how to do this cleanly?
[01:08:52] <joobie> i have a few, but they dont seem clean to me
[01:09:37] <joobie> seutje, i've not yet normalized the code.. just been focusing on getting it functional
[01:09:47] <seutje> joobie: timeouts, I guess
[01:10:19] <seutje> also, you have a lot of stuff in the HTML onload that isn't functional without JS intervening
[01:10:42] <seutje> like the pagination and the next/prev
[01:10:55] <seutje> they're actual <img> elements, so u can't rly sprite them easily to save requests
[01:11:14] <s3d_matt>  It says that on line 20 I'm not declaring it right: http://pastebin.com/iPhQMgnu
[01:11:18] <s3d_matt> seems odd to me!!
[01:11:22] <s3d_matt> anyone help?
[01:12:17] <Cork> s3d_matt: its an object, not a function
[01:12:30] <Cork> line 20, 21 and 24 is wrong
[01:12:57] <s3d_matt> Cork: oh - thanks, no idea how to change
[01:13:04] <joobie> seutje, I see.. I could probably get pagination to work without JS (using sprites), but Next / Previous I don't think can work without JS at all
[01:13:09] <s3d_matt> Cork: any suggestions, js isn't my area of any skill at all!!
[01:13:12] <Cork> mysqlData: settings.countdownDate,
[01:13:23] <seutje> joobie: I'm not saying it should work without JS
[01:13:26] <Cork> similar for the other two lines
[01:13:28] <s3d_matt> Cork, agh thanks, ill try that
[01:13:55] <seutje> joobie: I'm just saying that it would probably be better if the elements were built by JS so as to not confuse the poop out of any non-js users
[01:14:09] <seutje> joobie: and the spriting has nothing to do with making it work without JS
[01:14:12] <s3d_matt> Cork four line 24, is it t:[0] ?
[01:14:20] <s3d_matt> for*
[01:14:33] <Cork> s3d_matt: no the problem is the =
[01:14:35] <seutje> I meant that I would use elements with a class, and some text, and then image-replace it with CSS using a sprite
[01:14:36] <Cork> and the ;
[01:15:05] <seutje> and the "var"
[01:15:07] <Cork> oh, just realized var t = mysqlDate.split(/[- :]/); can't be there at all
[01:15:16] <Cork> seutje: there isn't a var on that line
[01:15:30] <joobie> seutje, I like that the markup was used in this case for images and text, rather than shifting it to JS
[01:15:31] <seutje> yeah, it's like { var foo = 'bar' }
[01:15:37] <joobie> seutje, to make it more SEO friendly
[01:15:40] <Cork> seutje: thats earlier
[01:15:46] <Cork> seutje: line 24
[01:15:50] <joobie> seutje, i thought about that originally and opt'ed for it over JS arrays purely for SEO purposes
[01:15:58] <joobie> .. this way, all the guts of the slider is crawlable
[01:16:08] <seutje> joobie: what do u mean SEO friendly? what is google gonna parse from your "next slide" button that links internally on the page?
[01:16:16] <Cork> s3d_matt: just realized what you try to do, you can't do it that way
[01:16:22] <s3d_matt> :(
[01:16:22] <joobie> the <p> text and the image names
[01:16:32] <seutje> also, google parse js
[01:16:34] <seutje> parses
[01:16:39] <Cork> s3d_matt: move the var sections up to line 2
[01:16:47] <joobie> yes, but how it interprets into my structure is questionable
[01:17:04] <Cork> s3d_matt: and have only until: new Date(t[0], t[1]-1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]), in the countdown call
[01:17:11] <joobie> I hear what you're saying though seutje
[01:18:23] <seutje> Cork: I didn't know u were allowed to do that
[01:18:31] <Cork> seutje: why not?
[01:18:35] <seutje> js> var foo = { var meh = 'poo' };
[01:18:38] <b-ot> seutje: No output.
[01:18:45] <Cork> uh, no you missed half the conversation
[01:19:03] <seutje> he said it borked on line 30
[01:19:17] <seutje> I'd expect it to go bonkers at line 20
[01:19:21] <joobie> seutje, if I use a timer onload to do that inital scroll through slides, is it possible to pause the timer when i hover over the div?
[01:19:28] <Cork> the problem is that he wants to preprocess a value before giving it to the object
[01:19:38] <Cork> and he does the preprocessing in the object declaration
[01:19:40] <s3d_matt> ahhh
[01:19:41] <seutje> joobie: sure, if u keep a reference to the timeout
[01:19:44] <s3d_matt> ill edit it now
[01:20:17] <joobie> seutje, and can i also kill the timer if i keep a reference to it also?
[01:20:39] <joobie> seutje, just thinking if hover over a slide, pause and then continue when hover ended.. if manual click of a slide, stop the timer all together
[01:21:00] <seutje> joobie: yeah, but pausing is a bit tricky, sorta
[01:21:02] <Steve^> If I have a jquery item ($el), can I get the master jQuery object used to create it? I have a couple of jquerys on the page and need to find out what is being used
[01:21:23] <joobie> seutje, why so?
[01:21:37] <seutje> joobie: well, afaik, u can only clear a timeout
[01:22:06] <seutje> so pausing would consist of checking how much time has passed, clearing the timer, and then restarting the timer with the usual time - time that had already passed
[01:22:26] <bet0x> any super dude here? :D
[01:22:29] <seutje> if u wanted to do accurate pausing, but come to think of it, that innacuracy shouldn't rly matter
[01:22:53] <joobie> it wont seutje
[01:23:02] <joobie> thanks, ill give it a try
[01:23:27] <seutje> yeah, sry, I tend to focus too much on worst case scenarios
[01:23:40] <joobie> seutje, that's the sign of a good coder
[01:24:23] <seutje> not if you end up spending 80% of ur time optimizing use cases that are never met
[01:24:29] <bet0x> i'm searching on a HTML document for the ALT tag present in the IMG tag, the issue is, it works for 1 result but when i got 2 only show the first ocurrence: http://jsfiddle.net/J74Cy/3/
[01:25:32] <seutje> bet0x: u gotta loop over temp.getElementsByTagName('img') to get them all
[01:25:39] <seutje> instead of just grabbing the first with [0]
[01:26:37] <seutje> so like var results = temp.getElementsByTagName('img'); for (var i = 0, len = results.length; i<len;i++) { someArray.push(results[i].alt); }
[01:27:27] <joobie> seutje, it's that balance between getting the job done and doing it well
[01:27:44] <joobie> seutje, like in most things in life
[01:27:50] <seutje> yeah, and I suck at it :P
[01:29:22] <bet0x> seutje how i do print the result of the array?
[01:29:53] <seutje> bet0x: console.log?
[01:30:21] <bet0x> on screen
[01:30:23] <bet0x> not console
[01:30:42] <bet0x> for example can i do alert(someArray.push(results[i].alt));
[01:30:43] <bet0x> ?
[01:31:10] <bet0x> seutje also here someArray comes?
[01:31:49] <seutje> bet0x: so an alert box *is* the screen but the console isn't? interesting...
[01:32:09] <bet0x> i know, was a bad example
[01:32:22] <seutje> bet0x: but no, array.push returns the new length of the array, not the pushed value
[01:32:26] <bet0x> i must assign the variable's so i update an span with the results
[01:33:03] <seutje> bet0x: then it's prolly not all that useful to push it into an array to begin with
[01:33:28] <bet0x> you lost me on the array part! :P
[01:33:58] <bet0x> i just want to assign the results and show a red dot or a green dot just to verify that the html is properly formated
[01:34:31] <bet0x> so i comment the push
[01:34:33] <bet0x> then i do alert(results[i].alt);
[01:34:34] <bet0x> and works
[01:34:39] <bet0x> just figured that!
[01:34:41] <bet0x> thank you!!
[01:36:52] <Nemurenai> I have a jQuery mobile related question
[01:37:04] <Nemurenai> I've made a site where I use the default AJAX navigation
[01:37:20] <Nemurenai> and I need to be able to tell which page I'm on to trigger some javascript
[01:37:42] <Nemurenai> I've inserted a hidden div on all pages with the page name (maybe there's a better way?)
[01:38:02] <geiregjo> Every time you goto/open a page a handler is triggered for that specific page.
[01:38:15] <geiregjo> Check the event in the documentation.
[01:38:22] <Nemurenai> But for some reason, when I retrieve the value, I don't get the one for the original landing page - I just get the previous one
[01:38:45] <Nemurenai> The handler isn't a problem - my page load function is triggered just fine
[01:38:51] <geiregjo> Ok
[01:39:02] <geiregjo> So in that handler you need to fetch some value?
[01:39:10] <Nemurenai> yeah, the name of the page
[01:39:21] <geiregjo> The name equals the id of that page no?
[01:39:30] <Nemurenai> so, if I start on page A, I get 'on page A', and if I then navigate to page B, I get 'page B'. If I then navigate *back* to page A I get 'page B'
[01:40:10] <Nemurenai> geiregjo, is there a canonical place to write the ID of the page in jQuery mobile?
[01:40:20] <geiregjo> Define what you mean with name of the page?
[01:40:29] <geiregjo> It's title?
[01:40:37] <geiregjo> It's id?
[01:40:47] <Nemurenai> geiregjo, no. It's an identifier I use seperately from the title
[01:40:58] <geiregjo> aha
[01:40:58] <fabioportieri> what does it mean to have null: somevalue inside animate function?
[01:41:12] <Nemurenai> I can't use the title because it can be in different languages
[01:41:13] <geiregjo> So it can be anything?
[01:41:41] <Nemurenai> yeah...well, it's like 'usersettings', 'userstatus' etc.
[01:41:45] <geiregjo> K
[01:41:51] <geiregjo> And it's different for every page
[01:41:56] <Nemurenai> yeah
[01:42:01] <geiregjo> You could use the jquery data function
[01:42:10] <geiregjo> in the page tag you add an html attribute
[01:42:25] <geiregjo> data-<name of your attribute>="<value of your attribute>"
[01:42:46] <Nemurenai> that's what I currently do;
[01:42:47] <Nemurenai> $("[data-role='page']:last").attr('data-name')
[01:43:09] <Nemurenai> Sorry - I said I was using a hidden div - I forgot that I switched approach
[01:43:11] <geiregjo> but you allways get the last page?
[01:43:15] <Nemurenai> no
[01:43:22] <geiregjo> :last  ...
[01:43:23] <Nemurenai> only when I go to the landing page
[01:43:34] <geiregjo> o.O
[01:43:39] <geiregjo> K just to get things straight
[01:43:49] <geiregjo> You need the value of the page you are on right?
[01:43:50] <Nemurenai> yeah, I use :last because there seems to be several pages
[01:43:52] <Nemurenai> yes
[01:43:54] <geiregjo> K
[01:44:07] <geiregjo> the first part of your selector selects all pages in your dom
[01:44:11] <Nemurenai> I'm new to jqm, so possibly I'm doing something the wrong way :-p
[01:44:15] <geiregjo> every time you load a new page it's added to the dom
[01:44:18] <enerel> hi guys
[01:44:24] <geiregjo> the :last selector selects the last one in the list
[01:44:33] <Nemurenai> hm
[01:44:37] <geiregjo> so that selector allways refers to the last page added to the dom
[01:44:49] <enerel> http://hogash.com/demo/kalypso_html_responsive/pages-team.php how does this gray image loads?
[01:44:51] <enerel> anyone
[01:44:52] <geiregjo> you execute that line in your handler right?
[01:44:58] <Nemurenai> ah...I see
[01:45:16] <Nemurenai> so...there is some kind of attribute about which page is the active one?
[01:45:19] <geiregjo> on what event do you do it?
[01:45:26] <bet0x> on a for wich has 2 results an ALERT show me the 2 results, but when i do $("#message").text(results[i].alt +' en la imagen ' + results[i].src + ' OK'); only show the last one, what can be? here is the fiddle if someone can check it: http://jsfiddle.net/J74Cy/5/
[01:45:40] <Nemurenai> .ui-page-active seems to be it
[01:45:44] <geiregjo> wait wait
[01:45:55] <geiregjo> you could do it like that but there might be a cleaner way
[01:46:02] <Nemurenai> I've tried different events. Currently I use pageinit
[01:46:06] <Nemurenai> yeah?
[01:46:21] <geiregjo> you need the value before or after the animation?
[01:46:30] <enerel> guys help
[01:46:41] <Nemurenai> preferably before. But not strictly necessary
[01:46:56] <enerel> http://hogash.com/demo/kalypso_html_responsive/pages-team.php how does this gray image loads? could not ind JS
[01:47:07] <geiregjo> http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforeshow/
[01:47:11] <geiregjo> I think this is the one you need
[01:47:29] <geiregjo> According to the documentation it's triggered on the toPage.
[01:47:54] <geiregjo> So in that handler you can get a reference to the page you are navigating to by doing $(this)
[01:47:55] <enerel> geiregjo: can you look into it
[01:48:14] <Nemurenai> so really, I should just select on .ui-page-active it seems.
[01:48:17] <geiregjo> $(this).attr('data-name')
[01:48:27] <Nemurenai> geiregjo, oh. Neat.
[01:48:31] <geiregjo> Try that
[01:48:41] <geiregjo> in the event handler of the event I just linked you
[01:48:55] <geiregjo> You know what this means right?
[01:48:56] <Nemurenai> ok
[01:49:08] <enerel> cannot find appropirate JS for that
[01:49:36] <Nemurenai> hmmmm
[01:50:03] <Nemurenai> My handler is defined as $(window).on("pagebeforeshow", function(){...});
[01:50:12] <Nemurenai> so 'this' is just window
[01:50:17] <geiregjo> that's right
[01:50:24] <geiregjo> so your selector is wrong
[01:50:47] <enerel> geiregjo: http://hogash.com/demo/kalypso_html_responsive/pages-team.php how does this gray image loads? could not find related JS
[01:50:53] <geiregjo> you have to bind that event to all pages in your dom
[01:51:24] <geiregjo> enerel, I have no idea
[01:51:30] <geiregjo> Use some debug tools to figure it out.
[01:52:29] <Nemurenai> geiregjo, hmm
[01:53:03] <enerel> geiregjo: like firebug? i am not good at it
[01:53:29] <geiregjo> enerel, You learn by trying.
[01:53:38] <Nemurenai> I'm not sure how I would go about binding it individually to the pages. It seems it would work fine with the handler I have and just selecting .ui-page-active
[01:53:45] <geiregjo> Nemurenai,  $("[data-role='page']).on("pagebeforeshow", function(){...});
[01:54:17] <Cork> missed a quote there
[01:54:21] <Nemurenai> geiregjo, but that won't trigger on pages that are added later, though, right?
[01:54:21] <geiregjo> Nemurenai, it's safer to do it the way I explained
[01:54:27] <geiregjo> Right
[01:54:36] <geiregjo> you have to use the live equivalent
[01:54:46] <Nemurenai> isn't live deprecated?
[01:54:59] <Cork> it is
[01:55:03] <Cork> and removed
[01:55:05] <geiregjo> It's safer because you don't know when the .ui-page-active class is added.
[01:55:09] <enerel> cork help
[01:55:13] <Nemurenai> I tried doing  $(window).on("pagebeforeshow",".ui-page-active" ,function(){...});...but that didn't work
[01:55:14] <geiregjo> There's no equivalent?
[01:55:19] <enerel> http://hogash.com/demo/kalypso_html_responsive/pages-team.php how does this gray image loads? could not find related JS
[01:55:21] <Nemurenai> is there?
[01:55:27] <bet0x> on a for wich has 2 results an ALERT show me the 2 results, but when i do $("#message").text(results[i].alt +' en la imagen ' + results[i].src + ' OK'); only show the last one, what can be? here is the fiddle if someone can check it: http://jsfiddle.net/J74Cy/5/
[01:55:52] <Cork> Nemurenai: try $(document).on("pagebeforeshow","[data-role='page']" ,function(){...});
[01:56:08] <geiregjo> wow
[01:56:16] <geiregjo> I don't know this new notation :D
[01:56:21] <fabioportieri> bet0x: maybe if you increment i ...
[01:56:34] <Cork> geiregjo: live has been dead for years
[01:56:46] <geiregjo> I know
[01:56:57] <Cork> and has been a bad idea even longer
[01:57:05] <fabioportieri> bet0x: nvm
[01:57:12] <geiregjo> I wasn't aware of the alternative
[01:57:23] <Cork> ?.delegate
[01:57:24] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:57:29] <Cork> geiregjo: ^
[01:57:46] <fabioportieri> bet0x: http://jsfiddle.net/J74Cy/5/
[01:57:58] <enerel> http://hogash.com/demo/kalypso_html_responsive/pages-team.php how does this gray image loads? could not find related JS
[01:58:03] <Nemurenai> Cork, that seems to do the trick,.
[01:58:14] <bet0x> fabioportieri save it please bcz i see my original
[01:58:14] <geiregjo> Cork, so On depends on delegate?
[01:58:26] <Nemurenai> thanks for the help guys
[01:58:31] <fabioportieri> bet0x: sorry, anyway just replace ,text with .append
[01:58:43] <geiregjo> ah not for future components
[01:58:47] <geiregjo> K got it thx
[01:58:56] <Cork> geiregjo: the other way around
[01:59:09] <fabioportieri> bet0x: http://jsfiddle.net/J74Cy/8/
[01:59:20] <Cork> geiregjo: bind, delegate, click/mouseenter/... has been moved into on
[01:59:42] <bet0x> thank you!!!
[01:59:44] <Cork> geiregjo: but delegate was the original alternative, on is just a new shorthand function wrapper for it all
[01:59:45] <geiregjo> so on covers all
[01:59:55] <Cork> yes
[01:59:58] <geiregjo> ic
[02:00:09] <geiregjo> What's the performance difference?
[02:00:12] <fabioportieri> you're welcome
[02:00:24] <geiregjo> Say if you use "on" everywhere?
[02:00:43] <geiregjo> Instead of using bind (for existing) and delegate (for existing and future elements).
[02:01:10] <enerel> Cork!
[02:01:20] <enerel> you have to help me here
[02:01:28] <seutje> sweet, demands
[02:01:30] <geiregjo> I don't he has to do anything ><

[02:01:44] <Cork> enerel: it's minified though
[02:01:52] <geiregjo> :D
[02:02:01] <seutje> beatly url
[02:02:03] <seutje> beastly*
[02:02:07] <Cork> ya
[02:03:04] <geiregjo> Cork, did you see my last question?
[02:03:15] <Cork> ah
[02:03:26] <Cork> between live and delegate?
[02:03:29] <geiregjo> It's not really a performance question but more of a best practice question.
[02:03:31] <Cork> or on and delegate?
[02:03:44] <geiregjo> Let me rephrase
[02:04:00] <Cork> on and delegate is the same thing just a slightly different syntax
[02:04:01] <geiregjo> Is it wise to allways use on if you are sure you don't need to bind to future elements?
[02:04:12] <fabioportieri> yes
[02:04:16] <geiregjo> Is it then not better to use bind?
[02:04:18] <Cork> geiregjo: bind is moved into on too
[02:04:30] <enerel> Cork - nothing related with that hover gray image thow
[02:04:36] <Cork> bind is better to use if you only have one target
[02:04:40] <enerel> sorry being rude yall
[02:04:42] <Cork> id's is one example
[02:04:51] <Cork> enerel: there is
[02:05:01] <geiregjo> Ic
[02:05:04] <enerel> searched for class and ID
[02:05:07] <enerel> no joy
[02:05:26] <Cork> geiregjo: if you have a bunch of targets your better of finding a common parent and delegating the listning to one handler
[02:05:29] <geiregjo> They should put some big remarks in the documentation that certain functions are deprecated.
[02:05:42] <Cork> geiregjo: the reason is that the more handlers to add to the dom the slower it gets
[02:05:50] <Cork> geiregjo: there is
[02:05:51] <geiregjo> Good point
[02:05:53] <Cork> ?.live
[02:05:53] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:06:05] <geiregjo> yes
[02:06:09] <geiregjo> But bind is still in there.
[02:06:15] <Cork> "version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9"
[02:06:18] <geiregjo> But in the docs they tell you to use on :D
[02:06:25] <Cork> geiregjo: bind isn't deprecated
[02:06:30] <Cork> only live
[02:06:44] <Cork> live is deprecated cause it has bad performans problems
[02:06:49] <geiregjo> K
[02:06:58] <Cork> and ppl really shouldn't use it
[02:07:09] <geiregjo> I've read some bad things about it in the past.
[02:07:15] <Cork> and live can't be fixed, cause the problem lies in it's syntax
[02:07:24] <geiregjo> Ic
[02:07:32] <Cork> and delegate does the same thing, but with a fixed syntax
[02:07:40] <Cork> and actually more control
[02:07:48] <Cork> live always bind on document
[02:07:54] <Cork> delegate can pick what to bind on
[02:07:54] <geiregjo> ouch
[02:07:55] <geiregjo> ><
[02:07:59] <bet0x> can i put an if inside a for to check if results[i].alt is empty?
[02:08:05] <Cork> yes
[02:08:11] <geiregjo> So you end up with a very big list of event handlers :D
[02:08:22] <geiregjo> Or do they flatten the handlers
[02:08:30] <bet0x> how empty if represent in javascript?
[02:08:34] <Cork> geiregjo: each call becomes it's own handler
[02:08:37] <bet0x> (i come from php)
[02:08:40] <geiregjo> damn
[02:08:48] <Cork> bet0x: .length < 1
[02:09:03] <geiregjo> Anyway
[02:09:06] <geiregjo> thx for the explanation
[02:09:22] <geiregjo> It seems that I really need to reread the jquery api.
[02:09:35] <Cork> geiregjo: $('.selector').live('click') is the same as $(document).delegate('.selector', 'click')
[02:10:01] <duderion> hi. is there a jquery mobile #channel here or may i ask my question here ?
[02:10:06] <Cork> except jquery does a search through the entire page for .selector, and then throws the result away and uses the original string in .live
[02:10:07] <bet0x> if(results[i].alt.length < 1) { $("#message").append('Empty');   } else { $("#message").append(results[i].alt ??);  }
[02:10:46] <Cork> $('#message").append(results[i].alt || "Empty");
[02:11:13] <geiregjo> ic
[02:11:22] <Cork> ?eval "" || "Empty"
[02:11:26] <bot-t> Cork: "Empty"
[02:11:30] <Cork> ?eval false || "Empty"

[02:22:28] <Cork> there is a long list of sites that let you beautify minified javascript
[02:22:54] <bet0x> enerel you find anything here, is like a big market lolz
[02:22:58] <Cork> there is even some browser extensions that does it on the fly
[02:23:53] <enerel> thanks alot
[02:23:58] <Cork> enerel: but there might be an easier way
[02:24:03] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do?
[02:24:26] <enerel> i whant that team image hover effect

[02:25:13] <Cork> enerel: most likely done though canvas

[02:26:31] <Cork> no, not yet
[02:26:38] <enerel> i see
[02:26:44] <bet0x> there is a "way" to read a url like curl with javascript?
[02:26:57] <Cork> you can do it for webkit and gecko through some tinkering
[02:27:04] <Cork> bet0x: no
[02:28:23] <bet0x> Cork jQuery.ajax() won't do it?
[02:28:32] <Cork> not like curl no
[02:28:33] <duderion> how can i reenable scrolling if i disabled it via e.preventDefault on(touchstart) ?
[02:28:39] <Cork> cause ajax is limited to the same domain by default
[02:29:04] <Cork> duderion: .off('touchstart')
[02:29:24] <duderion> ehm...
[02:32:13] <duderion> sadly not
[02:33:54] <duderion> i tried it like this..
[02:33:54] <duderion> http://pastebin.com/KhLQHrmj
[02:34:30] <Cork> O_o
[02:34:43] <Cork> you first bind touch start and then directly afterward remove the listener
[02:34:44] <duderion> &&
[02:34:48] <Cork> what's the point of that?

[02:42:45] <enerel> Cork: it is PACKER
[02:42:52] <enerel> how to decode it?
[02:44:06] <Cork> enerel: the beautifier scripts should be able to handle that too
[02:45:16] <Cork> if it doesn't try http://www.strictly-software.com/unpacker
[02:45:50] <Cork> a cleaner version http://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html
[02:47:39] <enerel> last one worked
[02:48:31] <Cork> packer is basically just the javascript wrapped in an array
[02:48:36] <Cork> and it all put into an eval
[02:48:46] <Cork> replace the eval with an document.write and you get the code :)
[02:51:27] <enerel> perfect
[02:51:35] <bet0x> http://matthewfl.com/js/unPacker.js to learn how
[02:51:37] <enerel> var domainroot="http://hogash.com/demo/kalypso_html/";
[02:51:43] <enerel> was all that mistery
[02:51:59] <bet0x> enerel i just buy the SAME template lolz
[02:52:05] <enerel> lol
[02:52:16] <enerel> yes will do
[02:52:18] <enerel> sure
[02:52:44] <enerel> i just wanted that feature
[02:55:15] <Cork> enerel: just google for javascript grayscale image
[02:55:28] <Cork> there should be a on of info on it
[02:55:55] <enerel> thank you
[02:55:58] <Cork> or possibly canvas generate grayscale image
[02:56:13] <enerel> you should told me that before
[02:56:38] <Cork> thought it was quite obvious
[02:56:48] <Cork> i told you about the different ways it could be done
[02:57:07] <fabioportieri> what's the point of havin null: somevalue; inside animate() ?
[02:57:15] <Cork> none
[02:57:26] <Cork> sounds like a script bug somewhere
[02:57:39] <fabioportieri> here http://jsfiddle.net/6Tewd/3/
[02:58:16] <Cork> heh
[02:59:12] <fabioportieri> quite tricky imo
[02:59:27] <Cork> ah your animating an svg
[02:59:41] <fabioportieri> not me i found it somewhere
[03:00:37] <Cork> the only thing i can think of is to give animate something to loop
[03:01:09] <fabioportieri> but changing the value actually changes the animation :|
[03:01:22] <fabioportieri> so i wonder wtf is null property
[03:02:05] <Cork> it works through special
[03:02:17] <Cork> v is just for the direction
[03:02:50] <fabioportieri> but how
[03:02:58] <Cork> how?
[03:03:06] <Cork> through the function speacial gives to step
[03:03:15] <fabioportieri> i don't understand how changing value to null changes the animation
[03:03:24] <Cork> null: v, is just so animate what range it should animate and in what direction
[03:03:44] <Cork> the point is that null has no visible value
[03:03:49] <Cork> its there for the animate function
[03:03:50] <fabioportieri> and it makes sense to you?
[03:03:53] <Cork> sure
[03:04:28] <Cork> animate first moves from 0 to 150 the next time it moved to -150
[03:04:37] <Cork> next time to 150 again
[03:04:44] <fabioportieri> ah
[03:04:46] <Cork> that's all that null: v, is for
[03:05:03] <fabioportieri> why has to be "null" and not some other property
[03:05:45] <fabioportieri> mm dunno how to explain better
[03:05:48] <Cork> fabioportieri: http://jsfiddle.net/6Tewd/7/
[03:06:23] <Cork> it's just there so animate can handle the animation steps
[03:06:23] <fabioportieri> so it's a sort of a hack
[03:06:26] <Cork> yes
[03:06:39] <fabioportieri> i see
[03:06:53] <fabioportieri> tricky..
[03:08:12] <fabioportieri> need a cig after that
[03:31:47] <FernandoBasso> I have a function that sets an "active" menu css class. I use cookies to remember the active menu. I need to call another function when _only_ _after_ a click (for instance) the document is ready. I am looking for ideas on how to accomplish this. Thanks in advance.
[03:35:12] <Cork> FernandoBasso: you can't really do that
[03:35:38] <Cork> you can trigger when the click happens, but not after
[03:37:05] <FernandoBasso> But there must be a way, perhaps not following the path I mentioned.
[03:37:33] <Cork> you could call a function from the end of the event click event hander
[03:37:42] <Cork> thats the closest to after you can get
[03:37:49] <Cork> at least if you want to be sure it runs
[03:38:10] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do?
[03:40:02] <FernandoBasso> After a user clicks a menu, which causes the page to load again, I need apply an "active" class to it. The problem is that the "Welcome" menu should have the class by default. I have a function that restore applies the class on the clicked menu (using a cookie), and also removes the "active" class from all other menu elements.
[03:40:21] <FernandoBasso> The problem is that this function also removes the one that should be "active" by default.
[03:40:48] <Cork> ok?
[03:41:24] <Cork> is the click cause a back reload or is it through ajax?
[03:41:30] <Cork> *causing
[03:41:36] <Cork> uh..
[03:41:39] <Cork> lets take that again...
[03:41:42] <FernandoBasso> Not ajax. The entire page reloads.
[03:41:53] <Cork> is the click causing a full reload or is it through ajax
[03:41:59] <FernandoBasso> Full reload.
[03:42:27] <Cork> nothing triggers after the link is followed then
[03:42:49] <Cork> the last even that fires is unload and it fires before the new page is loaded
[03:43:13] <Cork> and javascript from the old page can't do anything on the new page
[03:43:53] <Cork> (if you found a way that would be a security hole and the browser vendor would love to hear about it)
[03:43:54] <FernandoBasso> But in my case it is working, with the exception of not removing the "active" class on the welcome menu when the user just logs into the system.
[03:44:18] <Cork> so you need to handle it in the ready event
[03:44:23] <FernandoBasso> Because I call the function that applies the class on $(document).ready
[03:44:39] <Cork> and that is where you would have to handle it
[03:45:17] <FernandoBasso> Yep, but I can't find a way to make that function not to remove the "active" class on the "welcome" menu when the page loads for the first time.
[03:45:37] <Cork> how are you removing the classes?
[03:45:37] <FernandoBasso> After the first click on the menu, everything works fine.
[03:45:50] <FernandoBasso> I remove from all of the menus that have a 'hl' class.
[03:46:09] <Cork> and how do you add the class from the cookie?
[03:46:32] <FernandoBasso>         if ($(this).attr('data-hl') === activeMenu) { $(this).addClass('active'); }
[03:47:10] <Cork> btw why are you removing the class at all?
[03:47:26] <Cork> a full page reload wouldn't have it anyway
[03:47:42] <FernandoBasso> Because I have to remove "active" from any class that might have it, and then apply it only to the one just clicked.
[03:47:55] <Cork> so the server sets active classes too?
[03:47:56] <vetra> at the end of the function couldn't you just reapply the class to the welcome page. kinda dirty though
[03:48:01] <FernandoBasso> You are right.
[03:48:10] <Cork> on more then just the welcome element?
[03:48:29] <Cork> i really just don't follow where the problem is...
[03:48:45] <Cork> and honestly why this is in javascript to start with
[03:49:07] <FernandoBasso> How should you approach the problem?
[03:49:13] <FernandoBasso> s:should:would:
[03:49:20] <Cork> have the server set the class before it return the page
[03:49:26] <Cork> problem solved
[03:49:35] <Cork> you are doing full page reloads after all
[03:49:58] <Cork> i would base it on the url the user requested and use that
[03:50:08] <Cork> have it all in server code and no need for javascript
[03:50:13] <Cork> (and no cookie)
[03:51:11] <FernandoBasso> Okay, I though of that too, but I have to base it on the url and the ?action=value stuff too. That is why it seemed more reasonable using data-hl with a value for each menu.
[03:51:34] <Cork> whats the problem of checking action?
[03:51:48] <Cork> the server is already parsing it anyway
[03:52:07] <Cork> $_GET or params or what ever you run on backend
[03:52:16] <FernandoBasso> Cork: You are right.
[03:52:53] <FernandoBasso> Unfortunately I have to go to work in five minutes. I'll come back to talk to you again as soon as I can. Thanks a lot for the help.
[03:57:42] <hawtin> need some help here http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/eBFmC/2/ with adding a function that checks pass length and display a html like "passwords should be at least 8 ch long" ...
[03:59:25] <dwarder> can there be two <script>$(document).ready(function() { } </script> in one html document?

[04:01:34] <Cork> dwarder: you shouldn't skatter our javascript in the body anyway

[04:09:47] <Cork> $(this).hasClass('password') $(this).hasClass('email') and things like that
[04:09:55] <Cork> makes it really dynamic
[04:10:11] <hawtin> if(password == "" || password.length < 8){  document.getElementById("passlenght").innerHTML= 'Your pass must be at least 8 char long'; } else { ok }
[04:10:21] <Cork> opps sorry password and email is type not class -_-'
[04:10:56] <hawtin> so this should work you say?^^
[04:10:59] <Cork> hawtin: why are you mixing vanila and jquery so much?
[04:11:13] <hawtin> because like I've said Im n00b
[04:11:23] <Cork> $('#passlength').html('Your pass must be at least 8 char long');
[04:11:56] <hawtin> nice learning something everyday
[04:12:05] <hawtin> good feeling ^^
[04:12:32] <sacho> imagine what a feeling you'd get reading api.jquery.com :P

[04:23:30] <catmando> hey all
[04:25:00] <catmando> quick question: i have a file upload field that uses the HTML5 multiple attr
[04:25:33] <catmando> jquery only seems to see the first file selected inside when I call .val()
[04:25:55] <catmando> (although I can confirm that the server is indeed seeing all the files selected being passed through the form
[04:25:59] <Cork> catmando: what .val() see is what .value contains
[04:26:21] <Cork> and you can't get the files from .val() anyway
[04:26:32] <catmando> Cork: I only want the names to display
[04:26:34] <Cork> (or .value)
[04:26:48] <Cork> you would have to loop .files
[04:27:07] <catmando> Cork: .files you say, I will have a look; thanks
[04:27:19] <Cork> and it's not a jquery member
[04:27:25] <Cork> it is on the dom element
[04:42:25] <Browser> Hello, Anyone has used GalleryView? I am trying to set the autoplay but It doesn't work. I have set transition: 4000..
[04:45:48] <tankblergh> hi! Anyone using Durandal here? I wonder how you can execute jquery DOM manipulation in the viewmodel after the page has loaded

[05:20:40] <zissou> how to bind a handler to a change in a div's html?
[05:22:41] <Cork> you can't

[05:22:42] <b-ot> seutje: MutationObserver - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[05:22:49] <seutje> not cross-browser though
[05:22:54] <Cork> far from
[05:23:10] <seutje> yeah, it's a pain
[05:23:24] <Cork> and technically it's not a handler :)
[05:23:28] <seutje> zissou: whatever is changing the content should provide a handler
[05:25:54] <zissou> more spaghetti pls ... ugh. i need to learn some framework to organize my sh**
[05:32:45] <lessless> what docs are describing how to extend jquery to add my own function to the chain $('div.complex, div.date2').hide().my_awesome_function()
[05:32:46] <lessless> ?
[05:35:04] <Scoding> Anyone experienced with jwplayer?
[05:37:52] <seutje> I have a lil problem when I only show stuff when the user has focussed a textarea, but the stuff that's being shown needs to be clickable (like links), but the blur fires before the click does, so it's hidden and the click doesn't fire -> http://jsfiddle.net/rArFQ
[05:38:15] <seutje> this is the only solution I got to work somewhat properly: http://jsfiddle.net/rArFQ/1/
[05:38:29] <seutje> 100ms seems to be the minimum, anything lower and the click will still not fire

[05:58:31] <juria_roberts> Can some1 tell me where in jquery code insertBefore function is defined?Couldn't find it
[06:00:25] <sacho> juria_roberts, search for insertBefore: "before"
[06:00:52] <juria_roberts> sacho: yeah couldnt understand that how does it work?
[06:02:19] <fabioportieri> i hate juria roberts
[06:02:33] <juria_roberts> fabioportieri: why?
[06:02:38] <sacho> juria_roberts, it modifies the parameters you give so they match the ones for before(), then calls it.
[06:03:36] <Cork> juria_roberts: insertBefore appendTo and the like works backwards so they are mapped to the calls that match how the dom works
[06:04:18] <juria_roberts> ok does prepend & insertBefore differ?
[06:04:21] <fabioportieri> juria_roberts: i don't like that actress
[06:04:29] <Cork> yes
[06:04:46] <Cork> prepend appends at the beginning of the children list
[06:05:45] <Cork> it basically takes the first child element and asks the partent to add it self before that one
[06:06:26] <sacho> juria_roberts, parents.prepend(child) -> insert child as the first element for each parent. elements.insertBefore(target) - insert the elements as children of target's parent, before it.
[06:07:28] <Cork> hmm simpler is prob to say insertBefore inserts as a sibling while prepend inserts as a child
[06:08:11] <juria_roberts> ok understood is there an alternative to prepend?
[06:08:22] <sacho> an alternative?
[06:08:29] <sacho> what are you trying to achieve?
[06:09:33] <juria_roberts> sacho: if have a script tag inside a div if i prepend an element into the div the script tags dissapear

[06:30:20] <Qdest> Does anyone know if modernizr adds a class for touch devices?
[06:31:05] <Qdest> I'd guess it's html.touch but I can't find a list of available classes :P
[06:31:14] <tra> Qdest: http://modernizr.com/docs/
[06:32:11] <Qdest> track7 ¬ª Thanks, been looking there but couldn't find it.. must be blind. This is what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/73C2z/
[06:32:23] <zcserei> How can I animate a block so that it appears from the center of the block, grows rapidly until it's about 120% of the original size and shrinks back slowly to the original size?
[06:32:39] <Qdest> Basically, I only want it to return false (preventDefault) the first time.. so I tried binding it to one() instead of on().
[06:33:06] <Qdest> Sadly though, one() is really one.. so if I select the menu, deselect it and want to select it again it wouldn't work
[06:33:31] <Qdest> I'd like to "reset" it if I hide the menu I guess. Can I reset one() somehow?
[06:34:31] <Qdest> bleh sorry I meant tra

[07:18:56] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:19:30] <jomofcw> Is therte a way to move the cursor to the end after focusing an input[type=text] ? I've tried input.focus().val(input.val()); but it doesn't work.
[07:26:02] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to use http://jsfiddle.net/m4QCt/762/ to perform an ajax request for the other page's content... It works fine in jfiddle, but when I use my WAMP setup on my workstation, Firebug's console returns a 200 OK GET response in red font but the error segment in that code gives me almost nothing useful from what I can tell. Does this mean that my server configuration is messed up? Do I...
[07:26:03] <Wolf_22> ...need to allow something in my Apache?
[07:28:48] <thang> jomofcw: click anywhere in the textbox to see it in action: http://jsfiddle.net/vkxdC/
[07:29:43] <Saaether> that would be annoying if you want to fix a typo at the start of the input heh
[07:31:55] <thang> Wolf_22: maybe, have you checked your apache logs to see what happens server side when that request is made?
[07:32:05] <thang> versus whats happening in the browser via firebug
[07:33:06] <Wolf_22> thang: No, not yet... I can do that right now though (good idea--I should've done that).

[07:45:58] <fabioportieri> jop008: css

[07:50:20] <ravenzz> ?newContent
[07:50:21] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[08:01:57] <Siecje> http://jsfiddle.net/BjtNY/193/ I am trying to get this working in a file. http://dpaste.org/6z9JL/ but no calender pops up
[08:04:09] <vetra> there's an extra space in your format, might be breaking it
[08:04:09] <shoky> Siecje: open your browser's javascript console and look for errors
[08:04:37] <shoky> btw it's <!doctype html>  not <!doctype>
[08:05:02] <Siecje> so I can't put jQuery in script tags like that?
[08:05:17] <shoky> Siecje: what's the error?
[08:05:35] <Siecje> line 8 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[08:05:42] <shoky> Siecje:  can you guess why jQuery is not defined?
[08:05:47] <vetra> ohh yes you need to load the JS from document.ready
[08:06:00] <vetra> it is trying to do the JS before the field gets loaded
[08:06:23] <shoky> that's another issue, yes
[08:06:25] <c4ptnh00k> morning gents
[08:06:59] <shoky> mornin'
[08:07:23] <c4ptnh00k> some people in stack overflow should be shot
[08:07:27] <c4ptnh00k> on*
[08:08:33] <c4ptnh00k> just reading through some of the answers make me cringe
[08:08:34] <Siecje> http://dpaste.org/IMjDf/ still same error
[08:09:10] <shoky> Siecje: you're not including jquery :\
[08:10:43] <shoky> Siecje: and document.ready is:   $(document).ready(function() { .... });
[08:11:42] <jomofcw> Thanks thang I'll try this syntax =).
[08:11:42] <Siecje> so now I am including jquery.js and the error has become Object [object Object] has no method 'datepicker'
[08:11:59] <c4ptnh00k> datepicker plugin?
[08:12:37] <shoky> Siecje: pay attention to the order in which you're including things
[08:12:37] <Siecje> trying to get a datepicker widget for a text field with bootstrap
[08:12:41] <c4ptnh00k> include jquery ui
[08:12:46] <shoky> he's not using jqui
[08:13:01] <shoky> my guess is he's added the jquery include AFTER the bootstrap-datepicker.js include
[08:13:32] <Siecje> yeah that was it
[08:13:34] <Siecje> ty

[08:16:22] <lasha> I want to be able to call methods of a plugin instance‚Ä¶..
[08:16:36] <shoky> lasha have you read through:
[08:16:40] <lasha> var slideshow = $(".selector").slideShowPlugin();
[08:16:40] <shoky> `g jquery plugin authoring
[08:16:41] <b-ot> shoky: Plugins | jQuery Learning Center ‚Üí http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[08:16:44] <shoky> damnit
[08:16:49] <lasha> And then so slideshow.pause()
[08:17:20] <lasha> shoky: See what I'm trying to do?
[08:18:16] <shoky> lasha: yes
[08:18:28] <lasha> Help? :)
[08:19:06] <shoky> damnit why did jquery remove that awesome plugin authoring page
[08:20:31] <lasha> :(
[08:20:40] <lasha> I'm building a zoom/panning plugin
[08:20:43] <shoky> lasha: help? that's not a question
[08:20:52] <lasha> I asked my question already! :)
[08:21:01] <shoky> you want me to write it for you?
[08:22:10] <lasha> So, I have a fully functioning plugin that works fine. But I'd like to make it so I can access controls (an API for the plugin, so to speak) AFTER the plugin runs.
[08:22:21] <lasha> So if you can show me how to do that piece alone, cool.
[08:24:34] <jshultz> can someone help me out? In my jquery mobile web site, when I navigate to a page within the site, then hit back (either the browser back or the back button). the links on the page I'm going back to no longer work.
[08:24:59] <jshultz> This seems to only happen on iphone5
[08:27:13] <shoky> lasha: read all of this  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:27:41] <shoky> most importantly 'methods' and 'data'
[08:31:28] <Onkeltem> Hi all. Please, I need help. I'm looking for a gallery which acts like http://jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/index.php
[08:31:56] <lasha> shoky: that guide is definitely helpful, however it's not quite what I'm looking for‚Ä¶.
[08:32:18] <jshultz> if i refresh the page, then links start working again, too. :/
[08:32:25] <lasha> shoky: that guide shows you how to check if a plugin has been instantiated and stuff, and then recalling the entire plugin.
[08:32:51] <Mr_Grim> hey guys how is the performance of jquery mobile 1.3.1 over 1.2.x on android devies?
[08:32:57] <Mr_Grim> devies
[08:32:57] <lasha> shoky: what I'm looking for is something like var something = $('.selector').plugin(); something.destroy();
[08:32:59] <Mr_Grim> i mean devices
[08:33:01] <shoky> lasha: and it shows you how to make an API for your plugin "widgets"
[08:33:03] <Mr_Grim> key was stuck
[08:33:15] <shoky> lasha: but fine... so you want to do it your way,
[08:34:01] <lasha> shoky: For what I'm trying to achieve with my plugin, the method calling I want to have is the best way to do it‚Ä¶ haha
[08:34:03] <shoky> lasha: so  $('.selector').plugin();  needs to return something that has functions in it..
[08:34:20] <lasha> shoky: right.
[08:34:51] <shoky> lasha: what in javascript can have functions in it that you access with  .functionName()  ?
[08:35:14] <lasha> An object literal.
[08:35:17] <shoky> an object
[08:35:29] <shoky> so your method needs to return an object with said functions
[08:36:57] <shoky> lasha: so try that and if/when you're stuck, show what you've tried so far..
[08:37:36] <shoky> lasha: and remember you can store your plugin's data for specific elements with .data()
[08:38:37] <shoky> lasha: but.. what's wrong with $('.selector').plugin('destroy')  ?
[08:40:35] <lasha> Storing plugin data for elements with .data() is messier than I'd like it to be‚Ä¶.
[08:41:00] <shoky> it's the cleanest way to do this stuff. you can store just the API object itself
[08:41:13] <shoky> and that's what you return from your plugin method if you want..
[08:43:02] <lasha> But then I lose chainability, right shoky?
[08:43:29] <shoky> of course
[08:43:34] <shoky> you can't have it both ways
[08:43:58] <lasha> when you do return this.each(‚Ä¶.).....
[08:44:11] <shoky> that's not returning an API object...
[08:44:16] <lasha> how do you include object with it?
[08:44:20] <shoky> huh?
[08:44:30] <lasha> return this.each()‚Ä¶.
[08:44:35] <lasha> that's what allows chainability
[08:44:47] <lasha> if did  return objectLiteral;
[08:44:50] <shoky> or:  return this;
[08:44:53] <shoky> (same thing)
[08:45:04] <shoky> by returning whatever the function was called on,
[08:45:12] <shoky> you allow the caller to chain more method calls
[08:45:28] <lasha> if did  return objectLiteral; that breaks chainability...
[08:45:37] <shoky> right..
[08:45:43] <fabioportieri> bye
[08:45:43] <shoky> you can't have it both ways.
[08:45:48] <lasha> :(
[08:45:53] <lasha> there must be a way!
[08:46:03] <shoky> there IS a way :\\\
[08:46:13] <shoky> (not a way to return both types)
[08:46:24] <shoky> but a way to make a nice API that is also chainable
[08:46:36] <shoky> and this is it http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:47:00] <shoky> jquery-ui widget factory is also good
[08:51:28] <c4ptnh00k> shoky: can I just outsource my job to you for free?
[08:52:20] <shoky> uhm

[08:57:25] <c4ptnh00k> Lianzinho: I think you can just extend the plugin. http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[08:58:15] <shoky> Lianzinho: it highly depends on how the plugin is written, there is no general answer here. for many plugins, you MUST mess with the source if you want to add/change something
[08:58:54] <shoky> also highly depends on the change you want to make, of course
[09:00:55] <c4ptnh00k> i know in jqui you can do this. I found it in jquery.ui.widget.js http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/gFt7c/
[09:02:05] <shoky> that's just adding methods
[09:02:11] <Lianzinho> c4ptnh00k: yeah, I thought about that, but how to manipulate some internal functions? like, if I extend it to add an option, how will I make the plugin to use this option value?
[09:02:24] <shoky> has nothing to do with adding an option that changes the behaviour of already written code
[09:02:51] <c4ptnh00k> ah.. fair enough
[09:02:57] <shoky> Lianzinho: there is no general answer to this. to change something internal, usually you have to change something internal.
[09:03:42] <shoky> if you have a specific plugin and specific change you wanna make, ask away
[09:04:19] <Lianzinho> shoky: I have to change the foundation.orbit plugin
[09:05:05] <Lianzinho> shoky: I want to make it fullscreen, I already know more or less how to do it, but I was wondering if it was possible to change it withou messing the code
[09:10:04] <clov3r> so i'm using jq-mobile for the first time, does anyone know if a data-position="fixed" footer is expected not to work on iOS4?
[09:10:20] <clov3r> it's working on an iphone ios5
[09:10:39] <clov3r> but on the ipad iOS4 it renders inline
[09:11:27] <clov3r> using jqm-1.3.1
[09:11:58] <clov3r> platform page lists iOS3.2+ as having a full enhanced experience
[09:14:51] <clov3r> actually having said that, the footer is working as expected on the iphone, but the header, also with data-position="fixed" is not
[09:15:04] <clov3r> veeeeerry mysteeeeerious
[09:15:49] <clov3r> \me has also just realised why they say to build mobile-first
[09:16:05] * clov3r has been ignoring this advice for a long time
[09:16:22] <shoky> Lianzinho: what's the change consist of?
[09:18:16] <Lianzinho> shoky: the size of the container must be the size of the window less the size of the menu-bar, and the image width must be the width of  the window
[09:18:21] <Lianzinho> just that
[09:21:36] <shoky> Lianzinho: ya sounds like you'd need to mess with the code ;p
[09:37:01] <Amburger> I have to create a link to a jquery + ajax heavy page, and my manager wants a specific subpage to come up
[09:37:17] <Amburger> The baseurl/#media page
[09:37:34] <Amburger> but if I link to it directly, I just get the main page.
[09:37:53] <Amburger> Is there a way to link directly to the subpage?
[09:40:53] <Amburger> ah, found my answer:
[09:41:00] <Amburger> " We haven't ever supported the navigation to embedded pages with query parameters. This is actually one of our most requested features"
[09:41:10] <Amburger> ~8 months ago
[09:43:25] <sacho> Amburger, is this for jquery mobile or something?
[09:45:06] <Ricaz> Can I not do  if ($('.test').is('input')) { ... }  ?
[09:45:25] <shoky> sure can
[09:45:45] <Amburger> sacho: No just normal jquery
[09:46:33] <Amburger> sacho jquery 1.8.23 according to the source
[09:46:37] <nsanden> have a problem i cant even explain, grr
[09:46:49] <shoky> Amburger: well you just quoted from a jquery-mobile issue page
[09:47:01] <shoky> Amburger: and 1.8.23 is jquery-ui, not jquery
[09:47:28] <sacho> Amburger, you could easily add a snippet on load that checks the url hash and focuses on the element it points to
[09:47:37] <sacho> googling will probably give you good examples too
[09:47:53] <sacho> if you have a specific question about it, you can ask it here
[09:47:57] <Amburger> shoky: I'll ask to see if I can get permission to edit the destination page.
[09:48:11] <Amburger> I am just supposed to link to it at the moment.
[09:48:28] <Amburger> Sacho, thank you for the advice.
[09:50:41] <imglabs> Need some professional assistance folks. This script works fine in every browser accept IE (of course). It's supposed to play an intro video and redirect to the website. In IE it loops about 10 times and then works. http://pastebin.com/yhHXES0L
[09:59:55] <coaster> hi everyone
[10:00:11] <coaster> i wrote some code that cycles through an image list on left and right keypresses
[10:00:40] <coaster> on first load, it works
[10:01:02] <coaster> but if i go back a page and then come back to it, it starts detecting every keypress twice
[10:01:08] <coaster> how can I find out why?
[10:05:44] <Amburger> coaster: Which key event are you using?
[10:06:07] <Amburger> In java at least, each key press if 3 events, keypress, keydown, keyup.
[10:06:19] <coaster> everything is loaded via ajax, and the code in question is here: http://pastebin.com/nsEBPGKW
[10:06:32] <Amburger> coaster: If you are listening to a generic 'keyEvent' maybe you are catching both?
[10:06:43] <coaster> i have no idea why the tab indents are so crazy in the paste, it doesn't look like that here
[10:07:09] <coaster> im doing keydown
[10:07:32] <Amburger> coaster: I will look at it in about 90 minutes, I need to finish some lipstick tasks before a meeting (so I have a list of things I can claim are 'done')
[10:07:46] <coaster> lol okay, thank you
[10:12:21] <dapingwing> Whats happening ?
[10:28:57] <druiz> Hi everyone
[10:31:15] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle|detached: I take it detached means you are not around?
[10:49:30] <banister`shop> can someone explain this to me: "As of jQuery 1.8, the deferred.then() method returns a new promise that can filter the status and values of a deferred through a function, replacing the now-deprecated deferred.pipe() method."
[10:49:48] <banister`shop> im trying to grok deferred.then() but not quite getting it, what is the nature of the new promise returned from deferred.then() ?
[10:54:53] <sandropadin> member:banister%60shop I think that's so you can chain the `then` calls. http://jsfiddle.net/4fA8s/
[10:55:20] <sandropadin> @banister`shop
[10:57:02] <banister`shop> sandropadin: ah ok, so if i had: a.then(..).then(...)   then the second then() is only executed if the success callback of the first then is executed? (i.e it's not rejected) ?
[10:57:22] <banister`shop> i mean the second then() is only executed if the 'a' promise is resolved?
[10:57:44] <banister`shop> and not executed if 'a' is rejected?
[10:59:25] <sandropadin> I don't think that's the case
[11:00:01] <sandropadin> if a is resolved both execute sequentially, but if a is rejected, I don't think either would executre
[11:01:47] <druiz> http://gtsrecruiters.com/sandbox/ can someone tell me what part i did wrong here?
[11:01:56] <druiz> brand new to jquery tis is my first project test
[11:02:52] <banister`shop> sandropadin: well the first 'then' for 'a' can define a fail callback
[11:03:31] <shoky> druiz: you didn't put your code in a <script> tag, for starters
[11:04:05] <druiz> ok let me try and find that
[11:04:06] <sandropadin> @banister`shop yes, as the second parameter. 
[11:04:32] <banister`shop> sandropadin: thanks for your help :)
[11:04:51] <sandropadin> Consider the "new" promise returned by then to be the same promise.
[11:04:55] <druiz> shoky is that the $ sign thing?
[11:04:58] <druiz> sorry..haha
[11:05:25] <shoky> druiz: javascript needs to be in a <script> tag
[11:06:44] <druiz> shoky, ok i fixed it but its like...backwords? it starts expaned...also very choppy

[11:09:00] <druiz> ok so what id like to do is reverse the animation ( start collapsed) and Id like for the annimation to occur upon click on the view jobs button not the more less link) would anyone be willin to help?
[11:09:05] <druiz> www.gtsrecruiters.com/sandbox
[11:09:11] <shoky> druiz: if you want to change how it starts.. change your initial css.. it's doing what your code is telling it to do
[11:10:00] <druiz> gtsrecruiters.com/sandbox/sandbox.css
[11:10:15] <druiz> im so sorry im very new but hopefully a fast learner, what part of that css dictatves to start expaded vs collapes
[11:10:29] <shoky> how about height: 150px
[11:10:39] <druiz> GOT IT

[11:11:00] <druiz> wait what?
[11:11:06] <druiz> sorry, i dont see a height 150 in the css
[11:11:21] <shoky> you have style attributes on your elements too

[11:14:17] <druiz> :(
[11:18:01] <Ricaz> I can check if $(this).is('input'), but I can't check if $(this).is('textarea'). Why is that?
[11:18:31] <druiz> I just dont understand why it starts EXPANDED but the link says MORE
[11:19:48] <shoky> druiz: it says more because that's what the HTML says:  <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return changeheight(this);" id="morelink">more</a>
[11:20:59] <druiz> i know but on page load it says MORE....but the div is already in expanded mode...it should start collaped...and when the MORE is clicked it expadns

[12:45:24] <hXm> can i merge normal javascript in a jquery ready(function() ?
[12:45:57] <nutron> is this the right place to ask dumb questions for jqueryui?
[12:46:16] <hXm> yea
[12:46:17] <nutron> s/for/about/
[12:47:31] <walidvb> hXm: jquery is normal javascript
[12:47:46] <walidvb> just a library. so the answer is yes
[12:48:05] <nutron> I'm new to the dialog that ui provides, so what I'd like to do is generate a dialog to edit some db values.  What is the "right" or general way to prefill the form for the dialog?  I understand that this is not a function of dialog itself, but I can't really find a place to begin on how to use ajax calls to do this.
[12:48:15] <nutron> Actually, typing that all out just gave me an idea.
[12:48:37] <hXm> ok, then my problem is for anything else
[12:48:43] <hXm> one paranoia less
[13:03:47] <Amburger> coaster: Do you get the same behavior with keypress instead of keydown?
[13:04:39] <Amburger> coaster: There is a stack overflow on the problem here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7987454/input-fires-keypress-event-twice
[13:05:09] <Amburger> There are 5 recommended fixes, my favorite is to use keypress, since keydown can 'bubble' apparently.

[13:33:35] <mapsRus> How do I get a variable out of a call back function?  http://pastebin.com/uDkpb4Pn
[13:35:18] <shoky> mapsRus: you don't  http://pastebin.com/WGViFA2D
[13:37:30] <mapsRus> >shoky - thanks...I can definitely get the contents of the variable within the callback.  How do I use that data globally now?
[13:39:23] <shoky> mapsRus: you can set the variable like you did in the callback, and any code that runs AFTER the callback has already executed, will have access to that new data
[13:39:37] <shoky> mapsRus: but code that you just put after the callback is not run AFTER the callback has executed
[13:40:18] <mapsRus> ok, makes sense, I just need to put my next set of code in there as well.  thanks for your help!
[13:41:43] <shoky> mapsRus: you can also use deferreds/promises to be able to do stuff like:  http://pastebin.com/L3Qm7Eyi
[13:49:22] <lejocelyn> Is it normal that, when with jquery ui tabs, I load other pages, it does't show on the source code of the page ?
[13:53:16] <shoky> you mean in 'view source' ?
[13:54:00] <lejocelyn> shoky: yes
[13:54:06] <shoky> that shows the original source, not including anything that javascript/jquery/ajax might change in the page
[13:54:26] <shoky> if you want a representation of the live DOM, go to your browser's devtools
[13:54:28] <lejocelyn> then it's not blind people friendly ?
[13:54:33] <shoky> (press F12)
[13:55:07] <shoky> i don't know much about blind people
[13:55:15] <lejocelyn> any good way to "browse" like a blind person ?
[13:55:36] <shoky> you'll need something sharp
[13:55:39] <shoky> or a spoon
[13:55:43] <shoky> some alcohol.

[14:20:04] <unstable> http://jsfiddle.net/9bYFs/ ... I want to make it so when someone clicks on a map marker.. then they click inside that InfoWindow border.. it will alert them with the infowindow number, so InfoWindow0, etc. I'm a little confused by adding Google function event listeners.. vs just adding regular jqm event listeners. Why do I need to add google event listeners for the marker? When do I know which event listener to use, a google one, or a jqm one?
[14:23:36] <oojacoboo> can someone explain why event.stopPropatation() stopped my ajax request from double submitting?

[15:14:25] <pilotsnipes> I am sure this is an embarrassing easy question, but I've gotten myself confused. If I make a *synchronous* ajax/post request (using async:false) and the response that is returned from the call is a complete HTML page, how do I load that html code as a new page!?
[15:15:08] <pilotsnipes> At the moment, the html code/page is returned to me exactly as I want, but I can't get it to load in the browser and replace the screen I was on.
[15:15:21] <oojacoboo> pilotsnipes: $("#container-to-load-html-inside").html(responseFromAjaxRequest);
[15:15:29] <pilotsnipes> I don't want to insert it into a div etc.
[15:15:38] <oojacoboo> pilotsnipes: then use "body"
[15:16:16] <ybart> Why using AJAX if you want to replace the whole page contents ?
[15:16:24] <pilotsnipes> @oojacoboo - but will that not give me a page, that has <html ......  <body><html My new html code</body></html ?
[15:16:35] <oojacoboo> pilotsnipes: don't AJAX load this!
[15:16:45] <oojacoboo> you have a full DOM doc‚Ä¶ wth are you doing?
[15:17:17] <pilotsnipes> Ok! I know that's why I'm here for help
[15:17:39] <ybart> pilotsnipes: Maybe you want this: http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[15:18:34] <pilotsnipes> I have a log out button that sends a POST to my form. The return is a new HTML page. I just want to click my button and show the returned page/html.
[15:18:44] <pilotsnipes> I'm reading about the submit now - thanks ybart.
[15:19:43] <pilotsnipes> Sorry I should be clear The logout button is NOT part of a form. I may have mistyped on my last line there.
[15:20:01] <oojacoboo> pilotsnipes: make it a form?
[15:20:25] <pilotsnipes> If that is the answer then I suppose I have to do that.
[15:20:34] <oojacoboo> that's the correct solution
[15:20:52] <oojacoboo> don't force js to do what html already does
[15:21:16] <pilotsnipes> I'm not on purpose. Just ignorance. :)
[15:23:04] <Dieterbe> any idea why this $.ajax with type set to 'POST' triggers a GET request? http://pastie.org/7950345
[15:24:21] <ybart> Dieterbe: because of JSONP
[15:24:54] <ybart> Dieterbe: JSONP means adding a script tag to the DOM, so POST is not possible.
[15:25:06] <Dieterbe> oh noes :(
[15:33:34] <Blubsi> Hi
[15:51:09] <unstable> Hello Blubsi
[16:26:33] <nottheoilrig> what does the exclamation mark at the beginning of the multiline comment at the top of a lot of jquery source files mean?
[16:26:44] <nottheoilrig>  /*!
[16:33:24] <shoky> nottheoilrig: it has to do with the YUI minifier.. according to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/192d6cd4a30bef497f72b1ca9b62fd8b90ade806
[16:33:48] <shoky> "added a ! so that it passes through YUIMin untouched"
[16:34:57] <shoky> also for uglify, i think
[16:35:10] <nottheoilrig> shoky: ah, awesome, ty
[16:38:12] <Blubsi> How should I use this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487073/check-if-element-is-visible-after-scrolling/488073#488073

[16:40:40] <jaco> ^^
[16:42:25] <Toerkeium> guys, is there any possibility to include a web browser window with jquery into a div? so the user must not have to go and open a browser to do a simple seach to fill in the form contained by the div?
[16:43:21] <shoky> o.O
[16:43:35] <jaco> not quite following Toerkeium
[16:44:00] <Toerkeium> hm
[16:44:03] <Blubsi> ty alot shoky
[16:45:09] <Toerkeium> supouse you have to fill a web form with some data and to find that data you have to do a search on google. I was thinking on including a window in that form, to let the user search in google the information, instead of forcing the user to open an internet explorer app
[16:45:24] <Toerkeium> so you get what I mean? sorry, my english is not good at all
[16:45:39] <Toerkeium> so/do
[16:47:15] <jaco> I don't think that is possible
[16:47:17] <Toerkeium> like the browser objects provided from many language platforms
[16:47:23] <Amburger> Toerkeium: So they would use that frame to do the search and them you would pull data out of it?
[16:47:39] <jaco> i've never seen anything like that before
[16:47:42] <Toerkeium> Amburger: that would be the idea, yes
[16:47:56] <Amburger> Are frames still an html thing?
[16:48:13] <Amburger> I havent done webdev since the early 90's :3
[16:48:34] <Toerkeium> it would be a nice feature
[16:48:39] <jaco> you could use an iframe, but i've never seen one actually contain an entire browser window
[16:49:13] <Toerkeium> I could do it with ajax but it would be a pita to make it, not sure of it worth the effort
[16:49:32] <Amburger> Toerkeium: Does it have to be another whole browser?
[16:49:51] <Amburger> Toerkeium: Does this do what you are asking: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5842040/dynamically-set-frame-src-using-javascript ?
[16:49:51] <Toerkeium> just to let the user google to get the result
[16:51:29] <Toerkeium> I'll test that to see it better
[16:52:52] <Toerkeium> thanks guys
[17:04:14] <zoszko> HellO!
[17:06:13] <Pavlov> what happens if i call $e.one() multiple times with the same event string?
[17:07:34] <zoszko> Please help! I trying to load page content and be able to filter it. I am using isotope( 'insert', ... to add new data and I am using the isotope filtering. But the filtering does not work. I only got blank pages when I select an option.
[17:08:03] <druiz> Can anyone reccomend a way to have a lightbox pop up upon page load that allows me to use various html,css, jquery inside of the light box?
[17:08:15] <shoky> Pavlov: it'll execute multiple times.. pretty easy to TIAS
[17:09:16] <wilkinsmc> any idea why my page isn't the right height online but is locally?
[17:09:23] <wilkinsmc> none of my other pages are getting cut off
[17:09:35] <wilkinsmc> it's getting cut off vertically right under the form submit button
[17:09:48] <wilkinsmc> horizontally, rather
[17:09:55] <shoky> link?
[17:12:41] <wilkinsmc> amiablecomputerexpert.com/lessons
[17:12:49] <wilkinsmc> and yes, the font is big as shit if you aren't on windows 7
[17:12:51] <wilkinsmc> i'm working on that too
[17:12:59] <jaco> I'm getting a 404
[17:13:00] <wilkinsmc> obviously they don't have sakvall majalla on windows xp
[17:13:11] <wilkinsmc> http://amiablecomputerexpert.com/Lessons.html
[17:15:32] <jaco> which button the submit request at the bottom?
[17:15:59] <wilkinsmc> the page doesn't extend all the way down
[17:16:06] <wilkinsmc> there's supposed to be a bottom nav like on the other pages
[17:16:12] <wilkinsmc> but it's cut off early
[17:16:24] <shoky> eh you should be using absolute positioninig sparingly
[17:16:43] <shoky> not for practically every element
[17:17:09] <shoky> remove all the css you put on #containment2
[17:17:11] <shoky> start from there.
[17:17:30] <shoky> it'll already take care of the height cutoff problem. then there'll be other issues to take care of
[17:18:04] <shoky> there's no need for that element at all
[17:18:40] <wilkinsmc> other issues?
[17:18:44] <wilkinsmc> my other pages look ok
[17:18:46] <wilkinsmc> except for the huge text
[17:18:51] <wilkinsmc> but i need to install custom fonts
[17:18:58] <jaco> it's because containment2 has a set height
[17:19:09] <jaco> and backMainWhole also has a set height
[17:19:40] <wilkinsmc> but it's showing up right locally
[17:19:59] <wilkinsmc> it's prolly somethin weird i'll have to troubleshoot in a bit
[17:20:13] <jaco> i'd do what shoky said and get rid of that container
[17:20:41] <jaco> your layout doesn't seem to be effected by it
[17:21:38] <jaco> once you get rid of that container's height the content will expand to whatever size it wants to be and not be constricted by the height you gave the container
[17:21:54] <wilkinsmc> kk, i appreciate it
[17:22:44] <jaco> NP
[17:22:45] <shoky> also.. remove that width from <body>
[17:23:42] <alphanumb> hi guys
[17:23:45] <shoky> and put overflow:hidden on <body>
[17:23:47] <alphanumb> it's jquery time!
[17:23:48] <shoky> oops
[17:23:56] <shoky> scratch that last one
[17:25:05] <jaco> it's good practice though to not have set height and widths on your body
[17:26:27] <druiz> anyone think its bad practice to do a light box popup on load?
[17:26:32] <jaco> wilkinsmc: http://html5boilerplate.com/
[17:27:24] <jaco> what are you loading in a lightbox that can't be shown normally on your page?
[17:28:31] <wilkinsmc> lightbox?
[17:29:51] <jaco> it's a plugin normally used for expanding thumbnail pictures
[17:31:28] <druiz> sorry like a popup message that says " join out email list
[17:32:25] <jaco> users hate stuff like that
[17:32:26] <shoky> popups on load are always bad
[17:37:48] <druiz> is it possible to run jquery in a sticky footer?
[17:37:49] <druiz> lol
[17:37:51] <druiz> that sounded wierd
[17:38:34] <jaco> of course jquery is ran throughout your document
[17:41:45] <gen0cide> Hello, I'm using a jquery plugin called texext, and am trying to use a method provided by the plugin, how would I use this? http://textextjs.com/manual/textext.html#getformdata
[17:42:28] <gen0cide> The basic core of the plugin works: tags.textext({ plugins: 'tags' });
[17:44:49] <jaco> what are you trying to accomplish?
[17:45:48] <gen0cide> jaco: If the keycode ==  13 which is enter, append a "#" to the string value
[17:48:43] <jaco> do you have a working file somewhere that I can look at?
[17:50:26] <wilkinsmc> fixed everything, i think
[17:50:29] <wilkinsmc> font should be right size
[17:50:40] <wilkinsmc> all my friends were telling me everything looked good so i assumed it was fine
[17:50:47] <wilkinsmc> then come to find out the fonts were all big as hell on all their pcs
[17:50:54] <wilkinsmc> cuz they were on xp, mac os, vista, etc
[17:51:15] <wilkinsmc> oops, doesn't work in ie
[17:51:17] <wilkinsmc> of course
[17:51:20] <wilkinsmc> FUCKING IE
[17:51:27] <jaco> I'm of the opinion that body font needs to be 16px minimum
[17:52:34] <jaco> or 1em
[17:57:01] <gen0cide> jaco: http://jsfiddle.net/fQXqq/
[17:57:44] <gen0cide> How would I use that TextExt.onGetFormData(e, data) method?
[18:04:15] <jaco> so you're trying to pass a hash to the string value every time a user presses enter?
[18:06:06] <gen0cide> jaco: Yes.
[18:12:37] <pilotsnipes> OK, i've managed to make a jsfiddle of my query because I wasnt good at explaining myself earlier.
[18:12:40] <pilotsnipes> http://jsfiddle.net/L6bJ2/291/
[18:14:32] <pilotsnipes> Look at the data that is returned when the user clicks log out. It's actually a new full webpage. Is it possible, (this is why I'm here!) to load that data as a new page or can I only insert it into the current page that the user is on?
[18:14:56] <pilotsnipes> (my fiddle is obviously very simplified!)
[18:16:08] <wilkinsmc> schema.org markup makes IE format my text weird
[18:16:20] <wilkinsmc> so i'm wondering, should i put my NAP in a <p> or <address>
[18:16:49] <gen0cide> jaco: Or just alerting would be great, I just dont know how to syntacictally use the textext plugin's methods.
[18:17:11] <jaco> ahh
[18:17:37] <jaco> his documentation isn't the best
[18:18:29] <Aristata> When I click a file input and my file selection screen comes up, it there a way to capture from that when it closes, and what was selected?
[18:18:50] <alphanumb> hey guys, why am I getting so many errors when trying to make the download button stick: http://goo.gl/G8Mie
[18:20:21] <jaco> TextExtPlugin.prototype.onGetFormData = function(e, data, 13){console.log('enter key hit');};
[18:20:23] <jaco> ?
[18:20:25] <jaco> maybe
[18:24:19] <gen0cide> jaco: hmm I get an error in firebug
[18:26:59] <shoky> alphanumb: because you have no element matching #widget-content
[18:27:14] <beakman> how can i get the 'on' method to respect the dom after it's modified with js?  http://jsfiddle.net/cBVsX/
[18:27:33] <shoky> alphanumb: and also scrollTop is not defined
[18:28:25] <beakman> to be more specific:  i only want the last input on the list to append that html on focus
[18:28:34] <alphanumb> i honestly have no idea what i'm doing with this.
[18:28:54] <alphanumb> shoky, i have an id of #widget-content
[18:29:07] <shoky> alphanumb: not quite.  <div class='widget-content'>
[18:29:15] <alphanumb> shoky, how do I define scrollTop?
[18:29:26] <shoky> alphanumb:  var scrollTop = 0;   for example :\
[18:29:29] <alphanumb> oh wowo lol
[18:31:33] <alphanumb> should I delete scroll top?
[18:32:01] <shoky> do what you wanna dude
[18:32:06] <shoky> beakman: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cBVsX/1/
[18:32:57] <beakman> shoky: thank you.  i must have overlooked something in the documentation
[18:33:17] <shoky> beakman: except maybe that wont work with firefox ;S
[18:33:33] <gen0cide> Anyone know how to use the texext onGetFormData method? http://textextjs.com/manual/plugins/tags.html  http://jsfiddle.net/fQXqq/
[18:33:37] <beakman> shoky: forrr reals? :(
[18:34:24] <beakman> shoky: works on my firefox o_O
[18:34:26] <shoky> beakman: yeah mine too
[18:35:11] <shoky> i guess jquery does the right thing with regards to focus/focusin
[18:35:28] <beakman> shoky: thanks a million.  i'll be sure to reciprocate soon enough :)
[18:35:41] <shoky> beakman: and the part you're looking for in the docs is 'event delegation'  in the docs for .on()
[18:35:57] <beakman> shoky:  i'll read that right now
[18:39:19] <alphanumb> beakman, how do I get the button to follow the user after 500px have been scrolled through the page?
[18:39:52] <beakman> alphanumb: i'm the wrong person to ask about JS or jQuery
[18:40:12] <alphanumb> oh, sry
[18:40:25] <alphanumb> shoky, ^^

[18:43:05] <Kokoinnnn> hello
[18:43:36] <Kokoinnnn> are you mastercoder for javascript about?

[18:48:11] <Kokoinnnn> i question for you
[18:48:14] <Kokoinnnn> ?
[18:49:56] <samholmes> How do I get the index of an element in it's set of siblings?
[18:52:13] <systemfault> .index() ?
[18:55:39] <aniasis> I am executing $(window).width() twice on my site and it is returning different values.
[18:55:52] <aniasis> But a resize event isn't being triggered.
[18:59:04] <relipse> is prop('checked', false) the correct way to uncheck input boxes
[19:01:35] <shoky> relipse: yep
[19:01:54] <relipse> i thought there was a new jquery 1.9 way?
[19:02:37] <shoky> nope. it used to be with attr before 1.6 or something
[19:05:28] <relipse> $('input[name=foo][value=42]') <-- that is valid, correct?
[19:05:36] <relipse> i need to find the checkbox with value 42
[19:05:41] <shoky> nope
[19:06:05] <shoky> that only looks for the value attribute being set to 42. not the runtime value property. afaik
[19:06:17] <relipse> it might still work then it is a checkbox
[19:06:23] <relipse> checkbox values rarely change
[19:06:33] <shoky> oh if it's something that doesnt change then it should work
[19:06:42] <relipse> and if not?
[19:07:07] <shoky> [value=42] looks for the attribute 'value' being set to 42
[19:07:26] <shoky> that's the rule, for either case
[19:08:40] <relipse> what about the runtime value
[19:08:53] <relipse> just iterate?
[19:10:04] <shoky> you can use .filter for that
[19:10:08] <shoky> `api filter
[19:10:09] <b-ot> shoky: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[19:10:21] <shoky> passing a function that checks the .val()
[19:10:24] <shoky> $(this).val()
[19:11:20] <shoky> because .val() gets the runtime value (i.e. the value property)
[19:12:25] <relipse> right i understand
[19:12:26] <relipse> ty
[19:41:58] <nutron> Ok, trying to use the chosen plugin to make the selects a little more useful.  What I can't figure out is how to set css styles for the container (div) that is created after the select is defined.
[19:51:28] <nsanden> nutron: fyi select2 is chosen on steroids
[19:53:59] <gen0cide> I'm using textext a plugin For jquery I have a basic example running here: http://jsfiddle.net/fQXqq/4/ How would I use the "TextExt.onGetFormData(e, data)" method listed here in the docs? textextjs.com/manual/textext.html
[19:55:15] <nutron> nsanden: yes, I just switched back from select2, as after trying it.. clicking on the select box does nothing... after 3 hours of dumbing it down I couldn't fix it...
[19:56:33] <nsanden> ah too bad, its lot nicer to use
[19:57:35] <nutron> sure looks like it....  I have no idea why it doesn't trigger the select to open...  the default text is in it, so it's actually being called and run... but the onclick isn't firing.... or something is borked
[19:57:48] <nutron> I guess I could try the unstable version
[19:58:34] <nsanden> im sure if you put up a jsfiddle with your attempt someone here can help figure out why its not working
[19:58:53] <nutron> Yeah, I might try that

[20:48:58] <joobie> hey guys.. is there a good plugin or method to achieve text that scrolls into view really quick, then slows down and moves very slow? sorta like for like text to sit over a banner
[20:49:47] <joobie> i currently use animate() and play with the margin of the text, so it does slide but i want it to slide in quick and then go slow and kepe moving slowly until it disappears
[20:57:07] <Cork> joobie: check the easing library
[20:57:12] <Cork> ?g jquery easing
[20:57:13] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Easing Plugin - GSGD ‚Üí http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[20:57:14] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery Easing Plugin - GSGD - http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[20:57:59] <Cork> a few of those are supported natively in jqeury
[20:58:14] <Cork> but most of them still need the library
[21:01:15] <joobie> Cork, is there a way i can do it without the library?
[21:01:23] <joobie> i cant seem to find one in there based on their examples that suits
[21:01:57] <Cork> sure you could use the step callback in animate and do the math you're self
[21:02:14] <joobie> if you picture a background color.. text would slide into it very quick from the left, then when it hits center it slows down and still slides .. then comes to a stop eventually
[21:02:26] <joobie> ok thanks Cork
[21:02:39] <joobie> so you could do variable speeds with this and control delays?
[21:02:48] <Cork> sure
[21:03:00] <Cork> or you could implement an easing function
[21:03:12] <joobie> got any exampels of this Cork ?
[21:03:17] <joobie> ive only done basic stuff with animate
[21:03:20] <Cork> the easing library?
[21:03:44] <Cork> you should have like 15+ examples there
[21:04:32] <Cork> warning though animation isn't the easiest thing to get right
[22:06:21] <enthrops> How do I scroll to the bottom of the page without animation?
[22:06:51] <Cork> ?.scrollTop

[22:20:26] <skypce> i am with firebug

[22:23:48] <skypce> look please
[22:23:54] <skypce> my problem is with parallax
[22:24:02] <skypce> when i disable al bxslider
[22:24:07] <skypce> parallax works
[22:24:11] <skypce> :S
[22:24:18] <tw2113> enable it so i can see them together
[22:24:19] <skypce> but the problem is that i need both
[22:25:10] <skypce> yes
[22:25:11] <skypce> check
[22:25:11] <lethjakman> hey, with jquery's $.ajax DELETE method do I need to append the id to be deleted tot he post path? 'my/url/'+id or is there a better way to do that?
[22:25:29] <tw2113> so they're both active
[22:25:36] <skypce> but parallax doesnt works
[22:25:41] <skypce> tw2113:
[22:25:58] <skypce> if you see html
[22:25:59] <tw2113> disable bx so i know what the parallax part is supposed to look like
[22:26:12] <skypce> the #third div doesnt have inline css styles
[22:26:35] <tw2113> tell me when that's done
[22:26:58] <systemfault> lethjakman: Well‚Ä¶ DELETE is to delete a resource‚Ä¶. if the url isn't a resource, it's pointless.
[22:27:15] <systemfault> lethjakman: Might as well use POST if you don't care.
[22:27:44] <lethjakman> systemfault: wait...what? I am deleting a resource. I just didn't know if this was the proper way to do it or not
[22:28:21] <systemfault> lethjakman: If your "api" are not restful, don't even bother using anything but GET and POST (POST for a delete)
[22:28:29] <systemfault> "api"s
[22:28:47] <lethjakman> systemfault: I'm learning, I want to do this right. I just need to know what I'm doing wrong.
[22:28:54] <skypce> tw2113:  i was disabled all bxslider
[22:29:00] <skypce> but the problem is not it
[22:29:08] <skypce> :S
[22:30:00] <tw2113> so the problem still exists even without the bxslider stuff?
[22:30:43] <tw2113> if the wooden bg with multi-colored bottles are supposed to be the parallax part and sticking, it seems to be working?
[22:31:39] <systemfault> lethjakman: Let's say you have users, you could have your collection of users at /users , then you can use HTTP verbs to operate on that collection‚Ä¶ GET  /users to get all users of the collection, GET /users/23 to get the user with id = 23, POST /users to create a new user, PUT /users/23 to modify user 23 then finally.. DELETE /users/23 to delete it.
[22:32:14] <skypce> twisted`:
[22:32:16] <skypce> twisted`:
[22:32:29] <lethjakman> systemfault: so the first way I said to do it was right? I just didn't know if there was a cleaner way to include the ID with jquery's ajax method
[22:33:17] <systemfault> lethjakman: Unfortunately, there's no "nice way" to do it in the current version of Javascript, you'll always end up concatenating strings
[22:33:34] <systemfault> lethjakman: We need to wait for ES6 get to proper string interpolation
[22:33:45] <lethjakman> ok cool, thank you :)
[22:33:52] <lethjakman> es6 haven't even heard of that
[22:33:55] <lethjakman> when will it be released?
[22:34:52] <systemfault> Javascript/ECMAScript is designed by a committee‚Ä¶ and like everything designed by committee, it takes millions of years to get something released.
[22:35:44] <systemfault> Browser implementors are already implementing some of its features‚Ä¶ but beside that, we need to wait
[22:37:22] <Cork> lethjakman: there is a jquery plugin that gives you the restful verbs in jquery
