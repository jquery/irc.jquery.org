[00:55:53] <dgx> Hey all. How can I execute code after AJAX/jQuery tabs has been loaded?
[00:56:04] <dgx> or more like after a tab has been Reloaded ?
[01:27:08] <Kricir> can someone help me out with this line - psychicText.text('Hmmm.... Yes I see...').setTimeout(function() { $('.psychic-test span').text(message[next]); }, 1000); I'm getting an 'Undefined is not a function...' error
[01:27:56] <Kricir> I tried to write it with a delay instead of setTimeout but it didn't delay text changes
[01:28:33] <Kricir> I'm basically trying to create a flash message effect that will stay up for just a second and then go to another message...
[01:56:30] <dgx> Hey all, if someone is here, how can I execute code after reloading a jquery tab?
[01:56:35] <dgx> inside the tab i mean
[03:29:35] <mehrdad> hello
[03:29:58] <mehrdad> i've forgotten the name of the jquery plugin that makes div scrolling possible
[03:30:13] <mehrdad> i also ran a search but couldn't find it
[03:31:47] <mehrdad> anyone?
[03:56:09] <masscrx> i have simple quest
[03:56:25] <masscrx> if in file A, ill include functions.js
[03:56:41] <masscrx> then in functions.js i have function kill_him
[03:56:52] <masscrx> can i call it from file A ?
[03:59:35] <JackBauer24> masscrx: if file A is a HTML file, then sure, just call it after you included the JS file. If you want to include JS file into another JS file then use $.getScript()
[04:52:57] <dgx> Hey all, after changing the DOM, some events stop working. How do do I fix this issue ? For example after refreshign jQuery tab, via the console I can alter the DOM again, but not from the code itself. Ideas?
[05:07:02] <krastavac> no one here
[05:12:44] <JackBauer24> dgx: $.on()
[05:14:01] <dgx> JackBauer24, using jquery 1.4.4
[05:14:35] <JackBauer24> dgx: then $.live()
[06:11:55] <Jaycob_> does anyone know if you need to include jquery in a chrome extension that uses it if the site on which the extension operates already uses jquery?
[06:30:47] <doug65536> Jaycob_: it depends on how it loads jquery. if it is using AMD pattern, it probably isn't setting window.jQuery and window.$
[06:33:58] <doug65536> Jaycob_: the page might call var someScopedVar = jQuery.noConflict(); and window.$ and window.jQuery would be restored to their previous value (probably undefined)
[06:38:53] <drager> I'm trying to create elements dynamically but I dont want these elements to go "outside" of an other element (div). Ideas?
[06:56:47] <apajo> i'm trying to use an empty jquery element as a buffer before i insert everything to dom, after i have appended the buffer to dom and empty the buffer, all the elements in DOm get removed too. something like this -> http://pastebin.com/ewws9QQV
[06:57:17] <apajo> how can i "move" my buffer to dom so i wouldn't need to clean it or so the elements remain in the dom
[06:58:24] <apajo> maybe instead of buffer.empty() i should do something like buffer = $("") ? :D
[07:51:32] <jphase> apajo: .empty would work to empty your buffer, same with setting it to var buffer = []; or something similar. Is there an issue emptying?
[08:39:29] <AlexR> Is there any way to find the element bound to an event?  I have the event, but don't see anything in the console that shows what it's bound to
[08:49:37] <TheJHNZ> o/
[08:49:39] <TheJHNZ> $('#reg-con-'+next).toggle("slide", { direction: "right" }, 300);
[08:49:44] <TheJHNZ> what could i use instead of toggle ?
[08:49:51] <TheJHNZ> for just a one time action ?
[08:50:06] <AlexR> animate
[08:50:34] <TheJHNZ> doesn't work :S
[08:51:29] <AlexR> it's not a direct transition
[08:52:31] <AlexR> `api animate

[09:56:37] <nsanden> hi guys, i found a plugin that lets you drag (to enlarge) a textarea which is what i want, but when i finish dragging, it doesnt fire off an event. would this be easy to add into it? http://jsfiddle.net/4J5cy/
[10:03:26] <JackBauer24> nsanden: implement it in function endDrag() ...
[10:03:54] <JackBauer24> or implement passing argument with anonymous function to the plugin and call it in endDrag
[10:07:31] <nsanden> JackBauer24: thanks yeah i started doing that but not sure how to exactly, this is what i have so far http://jsfiddle.net/4J5cy/1/
[10:38:26] <nsanden> http://jsfiddle.net/4J5cy/  how can i add an 'onResize' event to this?
[10:40:39] <Lehl0r> to the textarea or the "grippie" ?
[10:41:11] <Lehl0r> ok textarea probably

[10:42:39] <Lehl0r> });
[10:46:08] <minotaur01> Hey All, I'm trying to build a set of web based tools to do basic networking functions like ping and traceroute, using jquery and php. What I want to do is return the output of those two programs in real time to the web based client, i have already build the php script and it returns the output one line at a time. But I'm not sure how to use jquery to populate a div with the data in realtime.
[10:46:08] <minotaur01> Any suggestions where to start looking?
[10:46:45] <nsanden> Lehl0r: i dont understand. how do i trigger it?
[10:47:23] <Lehl0r> you put a handler on your textarea
[10:47:49] <Lehl0r> and it triggers when the textarea is resized
[10:48:18] <Lehl0r> make it resizable first
[10:48:37] <nsanden> oh is resize() event already built into jquery?
[10:50:02] <nsanden> this should work then? but its not http://jsfiddle.net/4J5cy/4/

[10:53:21] <tables> im new to jquery

[12:21:49] <raj> I'm getting keyCode/which 10 when I press ctrl+enter
[12:22:20] <raj> thought it should be keyCode 13 with ctrlKey true
[12:29:46] <AlexR> raj: code example?
[12:31:57] <raj> $('#container').on('keypress', '.myinput', function(ev){ console.log(ev.which, ev.ctrlKey)})
[12:35:28] <AlexR> i get 10
[12:35:40] <AlexR> http://jsbin.com/ifeXILEr/1/
[12:35:51] <AlexR> hmm
[12:35:58] <AlexR> rather i get 13
[12:36:00] <AlexR> sorry
[12:36:59] <raj> I'm on chrome
[12:37:08] <raj> apparently some browsers give code 10
[12:37:25] <raj> what kinda unsystematic coding is this
[12:37:56] <raj> AlexR, it's 10 when it's Ctrl+Enter
[12:38:36] <AlexR> raj, I'm on chrome, ctrl + enter gives me 13 + true
[12:39:18] <raj> wtf
[12:39:26] <raj> even in your jsbin I get 10
[12:39:31] <raj> with ctrl+enter
[12:39:36] <raj> but 13 with just enter
[12:40:14] <AlexR> maybe your ctrl key is messed up?
[12:40:18] <AlexR> *shrug*
[12:40:42] <raj> lol
[12:43:03] <raj> alex, you're on a mac or linux?

[19:39:21] <AlexR> If I have a bound event, is there any way to figure out what created the event what the selector is on?
[19:39:34] <AlexR> *or what the selector is on*
[19:46:13] <TheJHNZ> is there a way to make something slide left
[19:46:18] <TheJHNZ> or right
[19:46:22] <TheJHNZ> and not toggle ?
[19:46:31] <AlexR> `api animate
[19:46:31] <b-ot> AlexR: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[19:46:38] <TheJHNZ> yeah i did that
[19:46:51] <TheJHNZ> i tried width and it edged up all squashed to the side lol
[19:46:57] <AlexR> left: -100
[19:47:40] <TheJHNZ> does it need to be absolutely positioned?
[19:47:50] <TheJHNZ> or rel
[19:47:53] <AlexR> absolute
[19:48:10] <TheJHNZ> rel worked
[19:48:19] <AlexR> *shrug*
[19:50:42] <TheJHNZ> hmm
[19:53:31] <kevireilly> Is this the appropriate room to ask a jQuery Mobile question?
[19:56:00] <AlexR> kevireilly: yes
[19:59:38] <kevireilly> Sweet, thanks AlexR
[20:01:03] <kevireilly> With jQuery Mobile, is there a way to disable side panels for certain resolutions? I suppose one way is to hide the button with CSS, but hoping there's a better option
[20:02:45] <AlexR> kevireilly: I don't know my query mobile, but generally responsive design should be done with css.  At least that's what I've always thought
[20:04:12] <TheJHNZ> ^
[20:04:25] <TheJHNZ> how do i change a global variable in a function ?
[20:06:04] <kevireilly> AlexR: Yeah makes sense indeed
[20:06:32] <AlexR> kevireilly: If you're using something like bootstrap, it takes care of a lot of it for you
[20:06:50] <AlexR> TheJHNZ: what do you mean?  you just change the value like you would any other global variable
[20:08:35] <kevireilly> AlexR: jQuery mobile is on a similar playing field as bootstrap
[20:08:39] <TheJHNZ> hmm
[20:09:36] <AlexR> *shrug* I haven't used it before.  If it's similar, I imagine there are classes available that will make elements disappear
[20:10:52] <AliG1000> I am using the jQuery autocomplete and in one of the lines I have the following:   $( "#developer1" ).autocomplete({     This hooks to the following input   <input id="developer1"></label>    so far so good, but if I want to display multiple inputs.  Do I have to duplicate the jQuery for #developer1, #developer2, #developer3 etc.?
[20:11:14] <kevireilly> Yeah there may be indeed. Otherwise I this media queries are used
[20:11:53] <kevireilly> You should check it out though. It's neato.
[20:14:06] <AlexR> AliG1000: You can probably do something like $("#d1,#d2,#d3…").autocomplete…   Or you can do an $.each loop.  Depends on how the code inside looks
[20:15:48] <AliG1000> AlexR: thanks - I will try them now
[20:25:37] <AliG1000> AlexR: the $("#id1,#id2,#id3") worked on the input perfectly.  I have a jQuery range slider also which, although it sort of worked (the slider can be moved), it moves them both at the same time.  I will try your $.each loop suggestion
[20:29:16] <ionico> hi
[20:29:54] <ionico> i'm new in jquery and ajax,  can you tellme how can i add mora data to this: 	$items [$array1['descripcion']] = 	 $array1['id'];
[20:30:33] <AlexR> What are you trying to add data to?
[20:32:14] <ionico> to the $items array
[20:33:18] <AlexR> That's more of a js question than a query question.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[20:33:25] <AliG1000> ionico: .push()
[20:35:45] <AliG1000> ionico:  try this - it's a little simpler to understand http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp
[20:39:46] <AlexR> Try to avoid w3schools
[20:40:11] <AlexR> w3schools is super out of date and refuses to improve itself
[20:41:05] <Mage> usually the biggest problem with w3schools is that even when it's up to date, it ignores important details
[20:42:20] <Mage> one might assume you can do [].push('hi')
[20:42:20] <Mage> :v
[20:43:24] <AlexR> technically you can :-)
[20:43:30] <Mage> it will not give you the results you want :p
[20:47:09] <AlexR> fair enough
[20:49:31] <felixjet> can someone help me please?

[20:50:19] <felixjet> oh damn nvm

[22:10:40] <zulcc> shouldn't "jquery mobile" be called "jquery-ui mobile"?
[22:51:37] <BretHudson> Hey guys, having some issues with .toggle()
[22:51:38] <BretHudson> http://brethudson.com/cloudcafe/
[22:52:01] <BretHudson> The divs just show up, rather than toggling/easing in
[22:52:12] <BretHudson> Anyone have any idea why it's doing this? Google's been no help.
[22:57:05] <hopkins83> BretHudson: read the topic
[22:58:09] <hopkins83> BretHudson: Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com
[22:59:04] <BretHudson> hopkins83: One sec, this might take a minute.
[23:04:06] <BretHudson> hopkins83: I can't duplicate it in jsfiddle.
[23:04:24] <BretHudson> hopkins83: What do you propose now?
[23:04:38] <BretHudson> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZy9F/ Closest I could get
[23:06:08] <hopkins83> BretHudson: all bug reports and problem issues require a reduced test case. see http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ on why they "are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs."
[23:06:12] <hopkins83> a reduced test case is an isolated example that demonstrates the bug or issue. it contains the bare minimum html, css, and javascript required to demonstrate the bug. no extra functionality or styling. a link to your site is not a reduced test case.
[23:06:54] <BretHudson> hopkins83: It's not working in JSFiddle at all is what I meant.
[23:07:01] <BretHudson> The .toggle function isn't
[23:07:16] <hopkins83> BretHudson: you should try to isolate the problem
[23:07:32] <hopkins83> like with the bare minimum html, css and js, not paste in your whole site
[23:08:16] <hopkins83> that way it'll be easier for all of us. chances are though that this way you'll find out what's wrong before you even get to return to this channel
[23:08:57] <BretHudson> hopkins83: Is there a particular way to enable jQueryUI with JSFiddle? It seems the UI functions aren't working.
[23:10:54] <visua> So, i'm trying to add url segment (deep linking?) support to a lightbox, any lib suggestions? I'm not sure jquery address is what i'm trying to do
