[00:17:47] <mazzachre> If in jquerymobile I do a changePage('somewhere.html?what=ever') and somewhere.html is already loaded but without (or wither other) parameters, will the page be reloaded from server and the existing elements replaced? Or what will happen? Or should I not even consider this and instead reload the page from scratch?
[00:32:47] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[00:33:00] <ProLoser|Work> so i have some syntax errors but only jquery itself is throwing errors
[00:33:05] <ProLoser|Work> unfortunately it's being a bitch to debug
[00:33:07] <ProLoser|Work> any tips?
[00:35:32] <Deele> ProLoser|Work, use something like Firebug, see console output, correct mistakes, step by stem
[00:35:34] <Deele> step*
[00:41:13] <SoulRaven> please help me, i don't know how to split the name, and replace the 0 with somethning else
[00:41:13] <SoulRaven> name="data[Gpswarranties][0][gpsuniq]"
[00:41:27] <SoulRaven> i want to replace the 0 with 1,2, etc
[00:42:38] <tomato> $new = str_replace("[0]","[2]", $string)
[00:42:39] <tomato> ?
[00:42:46] <tomato> or something like that
[00:42:47] <Spinkzeit> mazzachre: are you actually talking about jQuery's scroll() or just scroll css wise?
[00:42:50] <tomato> ohwait, this isn't php
[00:43:12] <SoulRaven> yes:)
[00:47:16] <K1ng`> how do i get check radio's value?
[00:47:23] <K1ng`> checked
[00:47:26] <SoulRaven> tomato: i think i nead in the first place to split the string somehow, and then replice the value, but how
[00:47:28] <sedawk> How do you close a jquery dialog that wraps an IFrame that has a form?  I want to close both the dialog and iframe after I submit.
[00:48:29] <tomato> SoulRaven, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp
[00:48:52] <coldhead> how many years have you been using this channel, K1ng`, and you still don't know how to use the docs?
[00:49:00] <coldhead> it don't make no sense
[00:49:06] <K1ng`>  :S
[00:49:26] <K1ng`> $('input[name=radio]:checked').val()
[00:53:48] <SoulRaven> tomato: yes, i know that, but my text have [ and ]
[00:54:02] <SoulRaven> how i split 2 elements on the same time
[00:54:23] <tomato> just split the whole [0] and replace it with a [1]
[00:55:12] <ProLoser|Work> Deele: that doesn't help me
[00:55:15] <SoulRaven> ok, but on the next iteration i will have 1 not 0
[00:55:18] <Datarecal> disconnected
[00:55:43] <Datarecal> did anyone answer on how a .validate doesnt run when a .submit is there
[01:08:56] <Whirl3d> in the statement $(".footer").data("contents", "feet"); all items of class "footer" will have a data item that contains contents='feet', right? Or does jQuery maintain the data item once for the collection of .footer items?
[01:09:43] <coldhead> Datarecal: if you check the validate docs it explains how you can have it run automatically on submit or you can call it yourself to test if a form is valid or not
[01:10:11] <coldhead> they have to get a copy each, Whirl3d
[01:10:22] <coldhead> or things would get confusing if you changed one and not another later on
[01:10:47] <Whirl3d> hrmm, thx coldhead, must be something else then.
[01:12:08] <coldhead> maybe you're thinking of how live actually binds to document?
[01:12:27] <coldhead> and catches all events and then tests if they match any live selectors?
[01:12:32] <coldhead> cause that is magical
[01:12:43] <coldhead> and Whirl3d... you're magical
[01:12:54] <coldhead> i'm scared when i kill in my dreams
[01:14:30] <Whirl3d> I'm trying to put a function in a data item that evaluates a css property for each .footer item like this: $(".footer").data({activeCSS:{height:function () {return ($(this).find(".contents").height());}, opacity:1});   (or similar)
[01:15:48] <Whirl3d> that way, when I say "showItem(someFooter)", it can look at the data item called activeCSS and get the end state animation props dynamically for each footer.
[01:16:39] <coldhead> sounds good
[01:17:22] <Whirl3d> not quite working yet...probably some mixture of }s and )s that I'm messing up. lol
[01:18:11] <K1ng`> how to calculate %?
[01:18:48] <Whirl3d> part/whole
[01:19:08] <coldhead> jshint.com, Whirl3d?
[01:19:08] <K1ng`> like 15/500?
[01:19:33] <coldhead> (15/500 * 100)
[01:19:34] <shaggy_> part/whole*100
[01:19:37] <Whirl3d> ?eval 15/500
[01:19:42] <coldhead> no botty
[01:19:46] <K1ng`> thanks
[01:19:47] <coldhead> last days
[01:19:48] <Whirl3d> stumped em
[01:19:49] <Whirl3d> lol
[01:20:07] <Whirl3d> where's bot-t? he was here earlier
[01:20:20] <coldhead> he's fallen and he can't get up
[01:20:25] <coldhead> i'm sure it's not intentional
[01:20:26] <Whirl3d> I know the feeling
[01:21:01] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat, arent percentages in 5th grade curriculum?
[01:21:15] <coldhead> K1ng` is a little slow/lazy
[01:21:29] <Whirl3d> for a fourth grader
[01:21:35] <Whirl3d> he's doing pretty well, I'd say
[01:21:51] <coldhead> K1ng`++
[01:22:00] <coldhead> he certainly has a big heart
[01:22:02] <Whirl3d> <--irc didn't exist when I was in 4th grade, btw
[01:22:12] <coldhead> and a sweet portfolio site
[01:22:25] <coldhead> k1ng's k1ngdom it's called
[01:22:30] <K1ng`> :p
[01:22:37] <beevi7> guys
[01:22:39] <beevi7> i need help :(
[01:22:42] <beevi7> http://manuelbieh.com/dev/details/
[01:23:03] <beevi7> on iphone only the first textnode gets wrapped in a span and hidden
[01:23:38] <beevi7> and i have absolutely no idea why
[01:23:43] <beevi7> and what i can do
[01:25:11] <coldhead> alert("This site works best not on an iphone") is the quickest fix
[01:25:23] <coldhead> at least until you can find a better way
[01:26:57] <Whirl3d> How are you selecting the items that need to be hidden?
[01:28:44] <Datarecal> is there a way to do a submit handler but still post the data to the action html ?
[01:28:53] <Whirl3d> Maybe safari handles the contents of your menu options differently because some are plain text inside the div, some are <summary> elements, some are <p> elements.
[01:30:58] <K1ng`> any idea why 50.00 + 20.00 becomes 5020.00?
[01:31:08] <K1ng`> (quantity * size) + framesize
[01:31:17] <Whirl3d> datarecal: bind the submit button to both actions using two different binds?
[01:32:36] <Whirl3d> K1ng, how is (quantity * size) + framesize   similar to 50.00 + 20.00 = 5020.00?
[01:32:45] <coldhead> K1ng`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[01:33:16] <colin_> if have this code: http://pastebin.com/SFxq8wGk but don't understand why it's throwing an error
[01:33:23] <colin_> how is arr[0] undefined?
[01:33:28] <colin_> is it a scope issue?
[01:34:12] <quicksilver> try arr[c] = {} before the assignment
[01:34:20] <quicksilver> or do it in one step as
[01:34:35] <quicksilver> arr[c] = { wednr : $(this).attr('id') }
[01:34:54] <quicksilver> java objects aren't like perl hashes - they don't autovivify.
[01:35:08] <quicksilver> colin_: ^^
[01:35:08] <Whirl3d> autovivify...love that.
[01:35:11] * colin_ is a php developer ;)
[01:35:32] <K1ng`> coldhead, well i am getting 7090 with parseFloat... its should be 160
[01:35:59] <coldhead> looks like you found a bug in javascript!
[01:36:03] <Whirl3d> K1ng, try parseInt
[01:36:14] <coldhead> but they're floattts
[01:37:10] <amit_usual> is there a way i can make a jquery post request with page reload
[01:37:33] <K1ng`> http://pastebin.com/pTb3adSG
[01:38:07] <dr0id> anyone facing issues with jsfiddle ? like its not letting me write into its html box
[01:38:23] <blackspotwiggins> K1ng`, why the fuck are you defining floats as strings
[01:38:25] <K1ng`> dr0id, its not let me save
[01:38:36] <dr0id> bad bois
[01:38:43] <K1ng`> blackspotwiggins, which line?
[01:38:50] <K1ng`> ah
[01:38:58] <blackspotwiggins> take a wild guess
[01:39:00] <dr0id> wondering why alert($('#item tr.multientry_row:last-child').length); gives me 0 when alert($('#item tr.multientry_row').length); gives me 1
[01:39:20] <blackspotwiggins> dr0id, maybe said row isnt the last child?
[01:39:27] <colin_> quicksilver thnx that works
[01:39:37] <K1ng`> http://pastebin.com/n5qjLDCp
[01:39:41] <K1ng`> better now?
[01:40:19] <beevi7> Whirl3d i'm looking for details.childNodes
[01:40:22] <beevi7> iterate through them
[01:40:31] <beevi7> if it's a domnode -> .hide()
[01:40:43] <beevi7> if it's a textnode -> wrap inside of a span -> .hide()
[01:40:51] <beevi7> on the first textnode it works
[01:41:12] <beevi7> all the following (inside of the same <details> element) won't get wrapped
[01:41:27] <dr0id> blackspotwiggins: ahh, heh. and jquery can't support last-of-type , shame
[01:42:15] <colin_> is there an easy way to send/post a multidimensional array to a new page?
[01:42:41] <Whirl3d> I was just wondering how jQuery handles <div id='something'>some plain text<p>paragraph text</p></div>...what are the childnodes of "#something"? Is it one text node and one 'p' node?
[01:42:47] <K1ng`> i did it
[01:43:33] <colin_> Whirl3d try console.log($(whatever_selector));
[01:43:44] <colin_> the object should show up in the console
[01:43:51] <K1ng`> 180.78125, how do i make it 180.78?
[01:44:13] <beevi7> Whirl3d both
[01:44:20] <uptownben> Hey all
[01:44:21] <beevi7> some plain text is a childnode
[01:44:27] <beevi7> paragraph text is another
[01:44:42] <Whirl3d> and the p isn't a childnode of the text node, cool
[01:45:09] <colin_> is there an easy way to send/post a multidimensional array to a new page?
[01:45:25] <Whirl3d> send it in the url as a hash
[01:45:26] <aximilation>  colin_ have you tried json?
[01:46:20] <colin_> no i have not tried json
[01:46:26] <colin_> Whirl3d hash?
[01:46:28] <aximilation> if I was doing it I'd either go serverside and save it to the session, and/or use ajax on the second page to pull the data in
[01:46:28] <uptownben> Can I use .link() to link a <select> element with a data object? If so, how would that work, how does the data object need to be formatted?
[01:47:28] <beevi7> seems to be a safari bug
[01:48:00] <trickz> can we not do $('input[type="hidden"][value="2"]') ?
[01:48:03] <colin_> aximilation to be able to save it to the session (php in my case) i still need to send it
[01:48:31] <trickz> ???????????
[01:49:49] <aximilation> colin_: I'm not sure what case you're working with, but: A. Would it be possible to drop the data into input elements (dynamic or static) and do a form post, or B. What about posting that data in an ajax call (as json) and have a secondary script save it to the session
[01:50:10] <aximilation> neither are very good options in my opinion....where is the data coming from?
[01:50:57] <colin_> first the data is retrieved from a MySQL DB, then it's rendered into a list which the user drags&drops into a table
[01:51:10] <colin_> after that i need to store that data
[01:51:24] <colin_> and reuse it in php in the next step
[01:51:28] <aximilation> ok
[01:52:02] <aximilation> well when you retrieve it you have it in php, if it has readymade IDs, that's cool, if not give it some, or at least an index. Drop that into your session
[01:52:29] <aximilation> when the user is manipulating the data, track the ID only, send them to the second page, match them up with the original data, everyone is happy
[01:53:07] <aximilation> at least that's assuming the users are manipulating rows, not individual points of data...do you think that would work?
[01:53:11] <K1ng`> 180.78125, how do i make it 180.78?
[01:53:23] <colin_> nope
[01:53:34] <aximilation> explain
[01:53:47] <colin_> to be more precise: the user has to place teams into (soccer) matches
[01:54:08] <colin_> the matches are already defined by the rows of the <table>
[01:54:32] <colin_> the teams are being dragged&dropped into the specified cells of each table row by the user
[01:54:49] <aximilation> well then I would go with option A I listed, dynamically build input elements and submit them to the second page
[01:54:53] <colin_> after that i need to store the match id, home team, and guest team
[01:55:08] <colin_> yeah that might be my best bet
[01:55:45] <aximilation> pair0=(id, team1id, team2id), pair1=.....
[01:56:11] <aximilation> though you could do an ajax handle on the data itself while you're at it
[01:56:50] <farhad2161> how can i do both $('#a').text('1'); and $('#b').text('1'); with one line code and command?
[01:57:11] <aximilation> let them "commit" or "finalize" a match/row, sending the ajax request to save the data
[01:57:51] <farhad2161> for example  $('#a' and '#b').text('1')
[01:58:17] <aximilation> iirc, $(selector, selector2) may get you what you want
[01:58:18] <colin_> aximilation the whole proccess may only be stored AFTER all data is proccessed by the user
[01:59:04] <Cork> farhad2161: $('#a, #b') is what your looking for, but i think text only acts on the first element in the selection
[01:59:06] <Cork> ?.text
[01:59:14] <aximilation> Do the individual matches have any relation to each other?
[01:59:16] <Cork> ah... the bot is dead
[01:59:41] <Cork> aximilation: no, not more then that they are stored in the same match array in jquery
[01:59:43] <quicksilver> .text('1') should apply to every element
[01:59:58] <colin_> yes and no, they all belong to the same competition but thats the only relation they have
[01:59:59] <aximilation> because again, you should be able to run each match through ajax to save it
[02:00:43] <colin_> http://www.zulius.com/how-to/send-multidimensional-arrays-php-with-jquery-ajax/
[02:00:56] <quicksilver> farhad2161: http://jsfiddle.net/hxex7/
[02:01:13] <aximilation> that works too
[02:01:55] <aximilation> so apparently you can send an array as a post value, I didn't know that
[02:02:01] <farhad2161> Cork: thanks
[02:02:04] <colin_> me neither
[02:02:21] <Cork> aximilation: jquery converts it to normal params
[02:02:58] <Cork> aximilation: {a:{b:{c:1}}} becomes a[b][c]=1
[02:03:12] <aximilation> yea, many ways to skin a cat
[02:03:16] <Whirl3d> how can i turn the id of an element into the name of a function that I can call...like <div id='footer_pg'></div> would call a function named initfooter() as a callback to an animate function. <div id='map_pg'></div> would call initmap() for example...
[02:03:20] <colin_> don't!
[02:03:26] <Cork> aximilation: i meant thats what jquery does
[02:03:27] <colin_> skin cats that is
[02:04:30] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to split this string and replace the [0] with an increment number? data[Gpswarranties][0][gpsuniq]
[02:04:38] <SoulRaven> i have try with val.replace(/data\[.+?\]\[(\d)\]\[.+?\]/, 'teste'))
[02:04:40] <aximilation> $('#cat').skin(function(){flay: true, alive: true});
[02:04:50] <SoulRaven> but replace all the text with teste, and i want to replace only the number between [0]
[02:10:33] <dexter_e> How to get a reference to a freshly append()ed  chunk of HTML ?
[02:10:51] <dexter_e>    var chunk= deepHTML.append( <div></div> );
[02:11:33] <dexter_e> I would like to replicate one small chunk of HTML and build a list and push the appropriate data into each chunk as its appended.
[02:11:51] <Whirl3d> could you do var parts=val.split("]["); var num=parseint(parts[1])+1; parts[1]=num; val=parts.join("][");   It's ugly, but might work
[02:12:05] <aximilation> IMO give it an id/class as you create it (based on the data it contains)
[02:12:30] <dexter_e> and then target it based on that id/class ?
[02:12:31] <dexter_e> wow I see
[02:12:33] <aximilation> that's probably going to be the cleanest
[02:12:48] <aximilation> so long as the data you are using to name it is unique
[02:12:59] <dexter_e> so there is no way to extract a reference to what has been freshly append()ed  eh ?
[02:13:13] <aximilation> mmm, there may be, I just don't know off the top of my head
[02:13:26] <dexter_e> aximilation: Thanks!
[02:13:43] <aximilation> but I don't think so, for the most part jQuery works by referencing HTML elements in some way.
[02:13:47] <aximilation> no prob
[02:14:01] <mrmagoo1982> hi peeps
[02:14:06] <aximilation> greetings
[02:14:20] <dexter_e> do I have to use a special method to set the ID during append ?
[02:14:44] <mrmagoo1982> i have a response in the var html and it contains the following "<a href="/uploads/2011/08/mitron-sl450-rgb-copy.jpg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mitron-sl450-rgb-copy-154x300.jpg"/></a>"  how can i extract the value of src in the img element
[02:14:44] <dexter_e> $('#ads').append(  template_item.html() );
[02:15:02] <mrmagoo1982> i tried var theurl = jQuery(html).attr('src'); but that gives me undefined
[02:15:20] <quicksilver> dexter_e: name it first then append it.
[02:15:20] <K1ng`> any idea what the heck is wrong with 		 $(document).ready(function(){ $('#quantity').change(calculator()); });
[02:15:20] <K1ng`> ?
[02:15:26] <aximilation> dexter_e: var chunk= deepHTML.append( "<div id='target_"+id+"'></div>" );
[02:15:39] <quicksilver> dexter_e: chunk = $('<div>some html</div>')
[02:15:45] <quicksilver> dexter_e: somethingelse.append(chunk)
[02:17:26] <dexter_e> Ok. I'm actually experimenting with delimiter-less templating. Meaning I have Chunks of PreMade HTML in script tags and I juggle those around during clicks and hope to append the data to them upon transplanting into the visible div.
[02:17:46] <aximilation> eww
[02:17:49] <dexter_e> So a Browser-side templating without the {{ }} and {% %} stuff
[02:17:53] <Whirl3d> k1ng, you want to just use calculator, not calculator() unless calculator() returns a function
[02:18:08] <aximilation> sorry, I haven't warmed up to the idea of using js to template a site
[02:18:28] <dexter_e> warmed up ?
[02:18:42] <dexter_e> as in , it might be a bad idea ?
[02:18:45] <aximilation> It just seems like it would be rather inefficient
[02:18:59] <dexter_e> Have you seen Weld.js ?
[02:19:03] <dexter_e> and similar approaches ?
[02:19:14] <dexter_e> Delimiter-less templates
[02:19:22] <aximilation> nah, I'm sure there are some effective ways of doing it, but I also see a big potential for abuse
[02:19:37] <dexter_e> abuse security wise ?
[02:19:50] <aximilation> not really, though that's always a concern
[02:20:06] <dexter_e> What do you mean by abuse ?
[02:20:14] <dexter_e> as in misuse ?
[02:20:16] <dexter_e> :)
[02:20:27] <aximilation> just people using a cool new tool and writing horribly inefficient code and making the frontend user suffer
[02:20:38] <dexter_e> I see
[02:21:03] <aximilation> eg: javascript is not always available, and when it is, the computer it is running on is not always as powerful as your development machine
[02:21:52] <aximilation> If you have a large enough project, there's a potential for memory mis-management that the admin will never notice, as the load is on the client
[02:22:02] <dexter_e> Well thats one of the perks actually , these systems are being geared towards consistent server-browser operation
[02:22:22] <aximilation> things like that. I use js as a tool, not as a framework :D
[02:22:47] <aximilation> I'm not saying it's a bad idea, it may be better in some ways, I just wouldn't feel right about doing it myself
[02:22:56] <dexter_e> The template can be engaged on the server as its being passed to the browser and then re-engaged by the browser itself without re-requesting
[02:23:11] <dexter_e> right on
[02:23:55] <aximilation> yea, good concept, I'd be loading the template from the server and then use ajax to pull new data in if I wanted to go that route
[02:24:43] <dexter_e> this library uses underscore map-reduce to rebuild queries browser side too
[02:25:19] <dexter_e> offline asynchronous client side database
[02:26:25] <dexter_e> I'm just on a little quest to get rid of string delimeters
[02:26:34] <dexter_e> I think Weld.js and Caustic.js are on the right track
[02:27:40] <pigiman> anyone knows why $("input#INPUTID").focus(); doesn't work in FF?
[02:28:06] <dexter_e> aximilation: are you using a server side rig too ?
[02:28:11] <johnline3> LITTEL PIGGI MAN :Ð
[02:29:00] <aximilation> I do most of my stuff serverside actually, like I said, js is a tool. I have been using jQuery on a lot of my projects recently because of the utility I get for the interface, and on occasion some ajax stuff
[02:30:51] <pigiman> hehe
[02:31:18] <pigiman> any ideas why focus() in FF doesn't do anything? :| Chrome works, IE works
[02:31:38] <dexter_e> nice
[02:31:47] <dexter_e> Whatcha rockin server side ?
[02:31:54] <dexter_e> ruby or somethin ?
[02:32:58] <aximilation> nah, I'm mostly php, sometimes some other stuff
[02:33:25] <aximilation> I do light linux sysadmin stuff and am setting up a hosting company, so there has been a bunch of bash and python involved for that
[02:34:35] <dexter_e> whoa nice
[02:34:43] <dexter_e> you doing any DNS automation stuff ?
[02:35:11] <dexter_e> like BIND and NS records n stuff ?
[02:35:36] <Whirl3d> how can I make a string into a function? like the string "initSomething" so that initSomething() happens?
[02:36:13] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: eval, but it's a terrible terrible idea.
[02:36:26] <dexter_e>     eval(  "initSomething"+"()" );
[02:36:40] <aximilation> yea a bit
[02:36:48] <dexter_e> wild stuff
[02:36:56] <aximilation> I haven't gotten deep into the DNS yet, looking a powerDNS
[02:37:11] <Whirl3d> quicksilver, dexter, thanks. Any ideas how to make the id of a div into a function without using eval? like id='footer'   the function would be initFooter();
[02:37:56] <quicksilver> I'd have a map from id names to functions personally.
[02:38:12] <quicksilver> initfunctions = { footer : initFooter, main : initMain }
[02:38:27] <Whirl3d> But the id's are being loaded dynamically. I don't know the ids up front.
[02:38:59] <quicksilver> and say if (initfunctions[$(thing).attr('id')]) { initfunctions[$(thing).attr('id')](); }
[02:39:07] <quicksilver> well you must know the function names up front?
[02:39:09] <dexter_e> nice
[02:39:40] <colin_> aximilation php you say? we would like to have you at #php @ oftc.net
[02:39:43] <Whirl3d> no, i just know that every "page" div that I load will have an init function that I need to call and it'll be different for every "page"
[02:39:47] <K1ng`> how do i get everything within div?
[02:39:48] <K1ng`> http://codepad.org/WonTt9tF
[02:39:51] <colin_> we're small but friendly ;)
[02:40:04] <K1ng`> i need to change each div's style within fiddle
[02:40:35] <colin_> aximilation the founder of dns.com also hangs out there from time to time
[02:41:08] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: I don't understand enough of your problem. If this stuff is being generated dynamically then you could also generate dynamically a call to $(function() { /* init stuff */ initBlah(); }) call too.
[02:41:11] <aximilation> colin_: *more* IRC channels? :D
[02:41:20] <colin_> yes
[02:41:31] <colin_> ofc
[02:41:42] <quicksilver> K1ng`: $('#fiddle div')
[02:41:54] <colin_> tbh i do NOT like freenode's #php
[02:42:10] <K1ng`> ##php ftw
[02:43:16] <Whirl3d> quicksilver, thanks for your help. I am loading content into a div using ajax. Then, once loaded, I hide the current content, display the newly loaded content and after it's visible, I need to initialize it's function. If it has a map, draw map, if it has a form, setup form, etc.
[02:43:37] <Whirl3d> but not just on loading. Whenever "activating" the page
[02:43:45] <K1ng`> thanks quicksilver
[02:45:48] <Whirl3d> initialize its functionality.... I meant. initialize it's function is confusing...sorry
[02:54:17] <Whirl3d> okay, I'll figure out another way to handle it. Thanks for your input, quicksilver
[02:55:39] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: by all means use eval :) but try to learn why it's bad in general.
[02:56:58] <aaairc> is there a way to check if a variable is a type of a certain class?
[02:57:16] <peol> aaairc: typeof
[02:57:46] <aaairc> that will tell me the class too... not just that its an object versus string or number?
[02:57:53] <aaairc> peol: ^
[02:58:45] <peol> aaairc: it'll work on those, but probably not on arrays, you can use jQuery.isPlainObject and jQuery.isArray, for example
[02:59:22] <catcatcat> hi, how can i enable radio button with jquery on ie6?
[03:00:14] <catcatcat> when i disable radio button then trying to enable it does not work on ie 6
[03:01:22] <peol> catcatcat: use .removeAttr
[03:01:36] <catcatcat> did not work!
[03:02:15] <peol> catcatcat: which version of jQuery?
[03:02:22] <ximarin> question: when i want to preselect a tab created by the UI .tabs and only know its ID but not its number, how could I do that?
[03:02:37] <catcatcat> peo: 1.6.2
[03:03:10] <peol> ximarin: you could find it's index by doing $('#id').index()
[03:04:18] <peol> catcatcat: I think you should use .removeProp in 1.6+
[03:04:46] <catcatcat> peo;: thanks i will give it a go
[03:05:16] <catcatcat> $("#hyperflex_shaft").removeProp('disabled'); like this???
[03:05:27] <catcatcat> did not work though
[03:05:37] <catcatcat> it is still grayed out
[03:05:44] <peol> catcatcat: .prop('disabled', false) ?
[03:06:00] <peol> iunno, haven't used 1.6+ that much
[03:07:10] <catcatcat> no worries thanks for the help
[03:08:51] <ximarin> peol: thx, that works great! :)
[03:09:13] <peol> ximarin: np
[03:10:00] <eto> hello
[03:10:09] <eto> does anybody know cloudflare?
[03:10:24] <eto> i would liek to know how they achieved those tooltips on their menus
[03:10:45] <Guest92580> Is there a way I can keep bound events on elements from the response of a XHR?
[03:10:53] <eto> they seem to use jquery, but i would like to know whether they use some tooltip plugin or own solution
[03:10:56] <eto> ?
[03:11:18] <peol> Guest92580: Not unless you use .delegate or .live
[03:12:58] <ckb> peol: I guess I could just delegate this one instance, but I'd much rather pull out the events with the XHR :|
[03:13:32] <peol> eto: reminds me of http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/custom-effect.html
[03:14:04] <peol> ckb: why? you should use delegates when there's live dom changes, that's why it's there
[03:14:28] <eto> peol: they are pretty fast is that because of css3 usage?
[03:14:30] <silv3r_m00n> hi there , I need something like this , for certain input text fields , if $(elem).val(a) is done , then a custom callback function (which was specified earlier) be called , is that possible ?
[03:14:31] <ckb> peol: drupal and ajax forms
[03:15:19] <ckb> silv3r_m00n: $(elem).change(function() { if ($(this).val() == "") { //do this } })
[03:15:45] <richthegeek> $(this).val().length is shorter and covers more cases I think?
[03:15:53] <silv3r_m00n> ckb: does that help in my case ?
[03:16:06] <silv3r_m00n> I need a callback function to be called after val() is called
[03:16:22] <ckb> richthegeek: it was a quick response, he wants a specific value
[03:16:35] <ckb> ah
[03:16:48] <ckb> $(elem).val().each(function() { });
[03:16:59] * ckb shrugs
[03:17:12] <richthegeek> ckb: that will iterate on the val() of the first elem
[03:17:29] <ckb> richthegeek: if only one element is specified?
[03:17:30] <richthegeek> ckb: eg, it will split the val stirng into an array and call the each func on each element
[03:17:53] <ckb> at first, he asks .val(a)
[03:17:55] <eto> is there a way to "stop" js on page during execution?
[03:17:56] <richthegeek> ckb: regardless, val() returns a string, which each can't iterate on, and if it could it would try iterate as an array (each char in the string gets passed)
[03:17:59] <ckb> I don't know what 'a' is
[03:18:12] <ckb> .val(a) could return a jquery object
[03:18:22] <richthegeek> .val(a) is a setter
[03:18:29] <ckb> yes, I'm aware
[03:18:37] <richthegeek> so would return the target element
[03:18:46] <ckb> ... I'm done here
[03:18:52] <silv3r_m00n> ckb: actually when setting val() I am not giving any function , its defined previously
[03:19:11] <ckb> silv3r_m00n: I don't understand what you're trying to do.
[03:19:22] <ckb> be more specific, and I can give you a definite answer
[03:20:03] <ckb> you want javascript to execute a function each time val(a) is called?
[03:20:04] <silv3r_m00n> I will just do $(this).val(a) , and along with setting the value to a it will call some function abc() which was specified in someway earlier
[03:20:10] <silv3r_m00n> yes
[03:20:33] <richthegeek> var abc = function() { } .... val(abc) would execute abc(), yes?
[03:21:00] <ckb> Does anyone know if .val(a) triggers the change event?
[03:21:08] <silv3r_m00n> I checked , it doesn't
[03:21:14] <ckb> hm
[03:21:21] <silv3r_m00n> I need a event to trigger on val() , that's all
[03:21:43] <ckb> well
[03:21:48] <richthegeek> no way to just change your code to .val(..).trigger("val-update") ?
[03:21:48] <ckb> rich, has it right
[03:22:02] <silv3r_m00n> richthegeek: no
[03:22:05] <silv3r_m00n> I cannot use this
[03:22:29] <richthegeek> can you search/replace for s/val(/cbVal(/
[03:22:31] <ckb> var abc = function(stuff) { return stuff; }?
[03:22:49] <richthegeek> then create a small plugin cbVal which takes a value and a callback function
[03:22:51] <ckb> then .val(abc('a'));?
[03:23:16] <richthegeek> ckb: I think the function passed to val() recieves (index, value)
[03:23:31] <silv3r_m00n> so no other way ? no event can be triggered ?
[03:23:36] <richthegeek> var abc = function(i, v) { return v; }
[03:23:53] <richthegeek> silv3r_m00n: val() triggers no events afaik
[03:24:06] <ckb> that's fail.
[03:24:41] <ckb> can you delegate form submits?
[03:24:43] <silv3r_m00n> I could do something like this $(this).val(a).change(); and write a change handler , but I even need to get rid of change()
[03:25:24] <ckb> dude
[03:25:46] <ckb> just do $.extend.cbVal
[03:25:47] <richthegeek> just verifying against the source
[03:25:58] <ckb> your best bet
[03:26:34] <ckb> rich, form submits delegatable>?
[03:26:54] <richthegeek> ckb: possibly, but I'm not 100% sure if return false; would stop the form submit from going through
[03:27:05] <richthegeek> I think last time I did that I delegated the mouseclick
[03:27:33] <ckb> ugh
[03:27:34] <ckb> PITA
[03:27:53] <uptownben> Hi all.
[03:27:54] <richthegeek> silv3r_m00n: val() definitely triggers no methods
[03:29:41] <ckb> richthegeek: what's the point in submits being delegatable if you can't return false; them?
[03:29:45] <ckb> lol
[03:29:56] <uptownben> if I have an object ( var object = {}; ), can I bind a "change" event to it with a handler?
[03:30:21] <uptownben> so if the value of that object changes, will the "change" even tfire?
[03:30:28] <ckb> I might just use live() for this part.
[03:30:34] <richthegeek> ckb: it might be a bug, a quirk, or just a fact of the way delegate works.. or I might be mis-remembering
[03:30:34] <ckb> delegation would be a hassle
[03:30:53] <ckb> .live() takes a performance hit, no?
[03:31:06] <richthegeek> ckb: yes, but generally such hits are small
[03:31:24] <ckb> this is a pretty in-depth application
[03:31:41] <ckb> I might just got with .click() on the submit button
[03:31:43] <richthegeek> ckb: but unless the DOM goes 600 elements deep it's not going to cause an issue
[03:31:59] <richthegeek> ckb: perhaps do a whitebox test on delegate'd submit
[03:32:18] <richthegeek> ckb: because you submit covers both "click" and any inptu recieving an "enter"
[03:32:32] <ckb> I've read IE8 has problems with delegating submits
[03:32:44] <encompass> I have a "data=" in a dom object, what is the best way to retreive that information in the data attribute?
[03:32:57] <richthegeek> encompass: String.match
[03:33:18] <peol> silv3r_m00n: I think your best bet is .val(a).trigger('change')
[03:33:22] <peol> -.-
[03:33:25] <ckb> $(this).attr('data') won't work?
[03:33:53] <richthegeek> encompass, specifically, if the string is "data=bob's discount burgers" then data = data.match(/data=(.*)/i)[1]
[03:33:57] <ckb> although, validators will have a fit.
[03:34:47] <grid_> heya
[03:35:16] <peol> ckb: you can use return false with .delegate but not .live
[03:35:38] <encompass> richthegeek: hmm wow, is there a better way to store the data in the div than "data" attribute?
[03:35:56] <richthegeek> encompass, if you are doing it all within scripting, then use the data method
[03:35:56] <peol> ckb: also, delegate lets you set the context, which makes it a bit less heavy on the performance
[03:35:58] <ckb> peol: cross browser and everything?
[03:36:04] <richthegeek> http://api.jquery.com/data
[03:36:22] <peol> ckb: just look at the api doc: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:36:30] <richthegeek> if you are trying to get "data" out of "<div data='bobobob'>" then as ckb says, $("div").attr("data") will get it
[03:36:43] <silv3r_m00n> I am doing $(elem).change() on a certain element but the change event is not being triggered , because I used a plugin called autonumeric on it , if I remove the plugin change() works fine, is it possible for a plugin to disable all further event handlers ?
[03:36:58] <encompass> I just need to store some data in particular divs.  I thought something like <div data="bobs"> woudl work, is there a better way?
[03:37:13] <encompass> it is being generated before I get to it with javascript
[03:37:22] <peol> .data('foo') will match data-foo='value' if there's no internal 'foo' data bound to that element
[03:37:41] <richthegeek> peol: TIL
[03:37:59] <peol> it'll also give you a typed object
[03:38:11] <peol> e.g. data-foo='{"test:true}' gives you an object
[03:38:24] <peol> {"test":true} *
[03:38:53] <encompass> peol: this may be in the rigth direction, I will give that a shot...
[03:39:03] <ckb> on a side note, I cleaned up my music library today :)
[03:40:05] <wangdoo> hello
[03:40:10] <grid_> i'm using a jquery ui dialog, when it will be opened the firt time, it is just ok, i can change things inside the iframe of it, but later, when i open it again, i want to get it's normal state back, without opened comboboxes and href # link to bottom etc, so it probably has to reload in the background? how could i do that? http://jsfiddle.net/pVswH/
[03:40:47] <wangdoo> I have a grid,when i click on one column ,i should get a text box to input data.How to do this?
[03:41:24] <pigiman> anyone knows why $("input#INPUTID").focus(); doesn't work in FF? (works in Chrome & IE)
[03:41:40] <peol> grid_: iframeElem.contentWindow.location.reload() might do the trick if you can't restore it some other way
[03:42:10] <peol> pigiman: you using jquery ui?
[03:42:18] <pigiman> no
[03:42:20] <pigiman> peol - no
[03:42:39] <richthegeek> pigiman: do you have multiple elements on the page using the same ID?
[03:42:45] <ckb> night jQ ;)
[03:42:52] <pigiman> nope
[03:42:57] <pigiman> richthegeek, nope
[03:43:08] <grid_> peol: is that just a normal way to do it like that with jquery ui dialog?
[03:43:20] <richthegeek> pigiman: can you get the element (in firefox) with document.getElementById('#inputID') ?
[03:43:35] <pigiman> yes , I`v tried to use document.getElementById('#inputID').focus()
[03:43:40] <pigiman> but it still doesn't work
[03:44:21] <richthegeek> pigiman: document.getElementById returns a DOMElement not a jQuery object
[03:44:34] <pigiman> oh right lol
[03:44:45] <richthegeek> $(document.getElementById("#inputID")).focus() might work, but it would be best if you console.log it to check it's actually returning anything in the frist palce
[03:44:46] <wangdoo> pigiman: have a grid,when i click on one column ,i should get a text box to input data.How to do this?
[03:45:06] <richthegeek> if not, then either you have multiple elements with the same ID or you have spelled it wrong
[03:45:17] <pigiman> richthegeek, yes I did console.log($(input#ID)); and I see my object
[03:45:18] <peol> grid_: I guess so, you normally does not need to reset a whole iframe. And if you do, you might be able to do $('select,input,textarea').val() on the iframe, perhaps also scrollTop(0) on the window
[03:45:21] <richthegeek> wangdoo: google "prompt"
[03:45:38] <richthegeek> pigiman: hmm, that's quite strange
[03:45:41] <peol> grid_: ehm, .val('')
[03:45:47] <pigiman> richthegeek, same code works with Chrome & IE
[03:45:58] <richthegeek> pigiman: maybe Firefox blocks focus() ..?
[03:46:01] <wangdoo> richthegeek: what?
[03:46:22] <richthegeek> wangdoo: a two-word response is very simple, containing only one very common verb.
[03:46:27] <pigiman> richthegeek, I googled for this issue and I cant find anything
[03:46:29] <encompass> awww shoot... I have items added to my dom and I can't bind to them... is there a way to do that in JQuery?
[03:46:50] <peol> encompass: .delegate
[03:46:59] * encompass googles
[03:47:11] <grid_> peol: would i need to to refresh it also when i use $(this).load('content.htm'); instead of iframes?
[03:47:17] <peol> yeah sorry, our helper bot isn't around
[03:47:26] <wangdoo> richthegeek:  yes,but i'm asking you which methos should i use to do it
[03:47:46] <peol> grid_: no, afaik .load uses .html, which remove everything currently in that dom element
[03:48:46] <lanmower> I have a question about parsing html returned by an ajax call.
[03:49:00] <richthegeek> wangdoo: you bind a "click" event to the columns, and in the bound function you prompt() for a value, then do whatever you want with what that prompt returns
[03:50:10] <wangdoo> richthegeek: when i click on a column it should be an editable one
[03:50:34] <richthegeek> wangdoo: $(".column.editable").click(...
[03:51:01] <rich97> Does anyone know why jQuery is creating the same object repeatedly in this case? https://gist.github.com/1122371
[03:51:34] <wangdoo> richthegeek: when you click,how to make it editable.Your above code ii not do that
[03:52:12] <richthegeek> wangdoo: I already told you - bind a click and either prompt() for a new value or change certain elements into inputs
[03:52:37] <peol> rich97: `elem` is global
[03:52:49] <wangdoo> richthegeek: how to change that element into inputs?
[03:53:18] <rich97> peol: It's not, this is just a snippet there's a closure wrapping around it.
[03:53:21] <peol> rich97: remove `p` from the var-list and move it inside the callback
[03:53:29] <rich97> ok
[03:53:40] <peol> 'it' being the var list, not `p`
[03:53:43] <richthegeek> wangdoo: $(".editable-element").each(function(){$("<input type='text' value='"+$(this).val()+"' />").insertAfter(this);$(this).remove();})
[03:53:51] <peol> you're already defining that in the callback
[03:53:51] <richthegeek> wangdoo: $(".editable-element").each(function(){$("<input type='text' value='"+$(this).text()+"' />").insertAfter(this);$(this).remove();}) in fact
[03:54:10] <encompass> So as found in the example here... http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ if I create another td in that table it will have a hover effect on it?  Even have the innitial dom objects are created?
[03:54:22] <richthegeek> yes
[03:54:43] <encompass> richthegeek: was that for me?
[03:55:01] <rich97> peol: Like so? https://gist.github.com/1122371
[03:55:46] <rich97> peol: Perfect :)
[03:55:46] <richthegeek> encompass: yes, delegate works on anything that matches the delegated selector, regardless of if those matches were created after the delegation was created
[04:05:44] <alaing> hi I have two tables and one is floated left so that the other would sit next to it. however when ever I resize the window the table thats not floated drops below the floated table.  This only happens in IE 6/7 which are the only two browsers my client uses. I tried it in fire firefox and the elements stay on the same line. How can I  stop this from happening in IE
[04:06:18] <peol> alaing: #css
[04:07:18] <alaing> oops sorry i thought i had stuck that in css
[04:11:01] <enotodden> Quick question: Keyboard events, which event property is normalized? event.keyCode || event.which?
[04:11:06] <enotodden> or*
[04:11:22] <wangdoo> richthegeek: It's not working.See this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/
[04:11:26] <encompass> I am trying to get this delegate to work but it seems it does nothing... any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/YuxPS/3/
[04:12:08] <encompass> Basically I want it so I click on that image (or the whole div for that matter) and it runs the event.
[04:13:22] <Renex> hello
[04:13:26] <rich97> Relating to my last question, my load() function seems to be returning the same objects, even though the parameters are different every time it's called.
[04:13:36] <rich97> https://gist.github.com/1122371
[04:13:44] <Renex> does anyone know why $('#bg_color option').live('hover', function(){}); does not work in chrome?
[04:15:07] <Renex> actually, it seems to not work in any other browser except firefox...
[04:15:41] <enotodden> Renex: Option does not natively support :hover?
[04:15:52] <wangdoo> encompass: When i click name,it should change into text box.http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/
[04:16:23] <enotodden> Renex: try mouseover mouseout
[04:16:28] <Renex> enotodden: what I am trying to do is to change the background color when I go over an option in a select menu (not when choosing an option)
[04:16:45] <Renex> it works in firefox as it should but not in any other browser
[04:17:22] <encompass> wangdoo: what does that have to do with me?
[04:18:25] <enotodden> Renex: http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2009/01/12/ie-jquery-hovering-and-option-elements/
[04:18:52] <vinilios> is there a version available that fixes ajax 304 responses for opera ? or any workaround to fix the issue ?
[04:19:16] <enotodden> Renex: Hover is not supported on Option elements in any other browser than ff apparently..
[04:19:52] <Renex> thanks enotodden . i will read that
[04:20:07] <wangdoo> encompass: I'm asking you to help me with that
[04:21:27] <encompass> wangdoo: it's better to ask the crowd, I don't know how to answer your question. Sorry.
[04:22:14] <rich97> No ideas? I'm well and truly stuck here.
[04:22:32] <richthegeek> rich97: caching?
[04:25:17] <rich97> richthegeek: I don't think so. I think it has something to do with the scope like my original question, but my JavaScript is advanced-novice level. If I console.log(p) in the load function the arguments are different but it's returning the same element every time.

[04:32:07] <wangdoo> i have a text,when i click text gets into text box,i have done this.next if i add data to it and click enter,it should be present.how to do this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/1/
[04:39:30] <sgp913> hi everyone, i'm using drupal 7 and trying to create a simple link list that can hide divs on the drupal node. i put the code at http://jsfiddle.net/N2WcN/1/  it works correctly, but in drupal it's having issues. i followed http://drupal.org/node/756722 and wrapped it, but no change. can anyone point me in the right direction?

[04:42:58] <wangdoo> richthegeek: i have a text,when i click text gets into text box,i have done this.next if i add data to it and click enter,it should be present.how to do this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/1/
[04:44:37] <wangdoo> whitman: what is keyup doing there?
[04:45:18] <whitman> wangdoo, when a key is pressed and released the function is fired.  event.keyCode == 13 checks to see if it was the Enter key.
[04:45:59] <wangdoo> whitman: it is doing exactly,how i wanted but how to pass this to a mysql query
[04:47:46] <whitman> wangdoo, depends how you're accessing mysql, but it's not really a jQuery issue.
[04:48:11] <wangdoo> whitman: after entering one word,i should place a cross mark,when i click it should get deleted,same like facebook
[04:49:09] <whitman> wangdoo, then create a new image element and append it, then bind a click handler to it
[04:51:49] <adamhutton> I'm currently running jQuery 1.4.4 and jQueryUI 1.8.6. I want to upgrade--is there a reason I should go with 1.5.2 instead of 1.6.2?
[04:54:12] <wangdoo> whitman: can you add that to jsfiddle
[04:54:56] <whitman> wangdoo, I'm not going to do your work for you.
[04:55:20] <wangdoo> whitman: hey no ,how to that
[04:58:10] <seutje> calling blur on an element with contenteditable doesn't seem to make it lose focus or am I doing something wrong?
[04:58:27] <formers> Just wondering whether there is a method to insert elements at a specific possition other than insertafter, insertbefore etc... ? I'm trying to keep two sortables in sync, but I'm finding that i need to use a bunch of ifs to determine whether to use append, insertafter, insertbefore...
[04:59:18] <seutje> no wait, it does, I'm just doing something wrong it seems o.O
[05:01:48] <sean`> HI ALL
[05:04:14] <austinbv> hello sean`
[05:04:39] <adamhutton> I'm currently running jQuery 1.4.4 and jQueryUI 1.8.6. I want to upgrade--is there a reason I should go with 1.5.2 instead of 1.6.2?
[05:05:12] <austinbv> if you wanna be living in the past
[05:05:21] <austinbv> if you like retro things
[05:05:38] <austinbv> if you are afraid of new stuff
[05:06:50] <Paul__> Hello, quick question, I wanna display the URL of a file in an alert box (after a drag and drop from my desktop to a webpage now available as an event). alert(event.target.url) does not seem to work, anyone know how I can get the URL of the file ?
[05:06:51] <adamhutton> austinbv: :) thanks. I've done a little research and know that 1.6.x introduces some .attr() / .prop() distinctions which may mean more code updates, but I haven't seen any "1.6.x breaks foo" notes anywhere
[05:07:14] <adamhutton> so, this was just a double-check--because I am a little afraid of new stuff :D
[05:07:31] <austinbv> there are always gonna be little code fixes between versions
[05:07:41] <austinbv> but there are no major bugs in 1.6x
[05:07:55] <adamhutton> austinbv: thanks again!
[05:12:46] <ciss> hi
[05:13:09] <austinbv> Paul__: try event.target.result
[05:13:39] <ciss> how do i select a parent element that is a child of a specific element?
[05:14:37] <austinbv> ?parent @ ciss
[05:15:13] <ciss> austinbv: i know about parent() and parents()
[05:15:15] <austinbv> oh the bot's sleeping
[05:15:35] <austinbv> ciss so?
[05:15:38] <austinbv> what's the issue
[05:15:53] <formers> ciss: $(".mySelector").parents(".myParen")
[05:15:54] <ciss> i need to select a parent element that itself has a certain parent element
[05:15:55] <formers> oh
[05:16:45] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, is it possible to remove background from a .jpg by JS?
[05:16:53] <ciss> i'll wrap up an example ...
[05:17:06] <austinbv> ciss: Paveloosha no
[05:17:09] <formers> ciss : have you used the child selector ?
[05:17:34] <formers> ciss: $(".mySelector").parents(".myParen > .myChild")
[05:17:50] <Paveloosha> Not in any case? I ???
[05:18:40] <austinbv> Paveloosha: sure you could write an image processing application in js but no
[05:18:55] <austinbv> it would need to probably run on node
[05:19:04] <ciss> formers: yep, didn't work. i'll create an example, maybe i made a mistake somewhere
[05:19:15] <austinbv> and be serverside not client
[05:19:52] <formers> Paveloosha: if you are just wanting to make it look like you are updating the background you can sort of hack it by using a transparent gif instead
[05:20:46] <austinbv> but to my knowlege no image processing in js exists
[05:22:01] <adamramadhan> hello
[05:22:17] <Paveloosha> <formers>, I can do that but that is not my goal.. I was trying to know that is there any way to take out the background from a jpg..
[05:22:20] <austinbv> well a little google came out with http://www.pixastic.com/lib/ which is a js ish hack using the canvas to do image processsing
[05:22:22] <adamramadhan> is there anything like http://mootools.net/docs/more/Utilities/Assets in jquery?
[05:23:48] <austinbv> Paveloosha: maybe if you told us more we could point you in the right direction
[05:24:00] <Paveloosha> <austinbv>, <formers>, I have seen this thing working but was unable to find that how they are doing this..
[05:24:23] <quicksilver> adamramadhan: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/ ?
[05:24:46] <adamramadhan> for css?
[05:24:48] <adamramadhan> same?
[05:24:54] <adamramadhan> i mean dataType: css ?
[05:25:00] <adamramadhan> or just put it data will be fine
[05:25:19] <Paveloosha> Suppos I am using a logo with white background.. in .jpg format.. Now goal is to take out the white background and show it like png style..
[05:25:52] <austinbv> Paveloosha: you could use the canvas check for the most frequent solid color
[05:26:00] <austinbv> change that color to transparent
[05:26:03] <austinbv> and save
[05:26:10] <austinbv> but that is still very elementrary
[05:27:23] <Paveloosha> <austinbv>, canvas is a higher solution, they are using something simple..
[05:28:19] <ciss> formers: $(".mySelector").parents(".myParen > .myChild") works with jquery > 1.2.6
[05:28:50] <formers> ciss: what are you using ?
[05:28:58] <Paveloosha> Please check out this link http://www.aegeaneshop.com/Home.htm ...... see "AeGean Shop" .. at banner.. They are using a jpg but it is transparent
[05:29:01] <ciss> formers: 1.2.6 :/
[05:29:06] <formers> oh
[05:29:37] <Paveloosha> strenge.. I cant see any js included at the page to !!!
[05:30:36] <Paveloosha> no, there issome script but dont think they are for this job
[05:32:00] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, jpgs dont have transparency
[05:32:06] <seutje> what the poo... I call blur on a contenteditable element, it's focusout fires and shit, but there's still a carret blinking in the element o.O
[05:32:16] <seutje> css also behaves like focus was lost
[05:32:53] <seutje> (in chrome)
[05:33:22] <seutje> hmz, firefox is doing the exact same, weird shit
[05:33:29] <Paveloosha> <blackspotwiggins>, please check out this link http://www.aegeaneshop.com/Home.htm .. go to view source and find for logo.jpg
[05:33:42] <blackspotwiggins> you cant do it?
[05:34:06] <vStone> Could somebody confirm $(window).resize(function() { alert('test'); });  breaks their browser? :)
[05:34:07] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, http://www.aegeaneshop.com/Images/bgLogo.jpg
[05:34:09] <formers> ciss: sorry I only started jquery with 1.4 ish
[05:36:11] <austinbv> wow irssi really went fail sauce there
[05:36:57] <formers> vStone: yes!
[05:37:23] <formers> my firefox is gone
[05:37:31] <Paveloosha> <blackspotwiggins>, Ohhhhh God .. I was pulling my hair out .. ha ha ha..
[05:37:43] <Paveloosha> Thanks a lot
[05:37:56] <seutje> weird shit, yo:
[05:37:58] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/zZX37/
[05:39:40] <vStone> damned. I was hoping it was a local issue. Now I'll have to work arround it. Thanks for confirming formers
[05:40:38] <formers> actually it wasn't so much broken, it was hidden when I clicked seutje link it came back up however, firebug reported 9 errors
[05:43:17] <mneimne> hey guys am using clear box for my website but when a flash content exist in the background i get flickerry images
[05:44:19] <formers> seutje: what's wrong with it ?
[05:44:31] <seutje> it loses focus, yet retains it
[05:45:06] <seutje> everything acts as if focus was lost
[05:45:14] <formers> not in firefox
[05:45:23] <seutje> except the lil caret still blinks in the field and when u type, it focusses it again
[05:46:03] <seutje> formers: hm, guess chrome only then
[05:46:18] <formers> I'm clicking on it to get focus, the div border turns red, I click on the button and the red border is removed and then I'm typing and nothing happens.
[05:46:48] <formers> yeah not in firefox
[05:46:50] <seutje> formers: hm, guess chrome only then
[05:47:15] <seutje> explicitly throwing a blur on the element doesn't change anything q.q
[05:47:29] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, focus on something else?
[05:47:43] <formers> yeha just tried it in chrome, and it was doing what you mentioned
[05:47:43] <seutje> tried $(document).focus()
[05:48:24] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, the fiddle seems to work normal for me
[05:48:33] <seutje> what chromesies?
[05:48:43] <seutje> 14 dev?
[05:48:49] <blackspotwiggins> firefox 6
[05:49:01] <seutje> formers: hm, guess chrome only then <- blackspotwiggins
[05:49:04] <blackspotwiggins> ah, didnt notice it was chrome only
[05:50:14] <seutje> hmm weird, throwing focus on a random button seems to prevent the element's focusout to fire q.q
[05:50:19] <formers> hmmm using html5 already...
[05:50:50] <austinbv> when the docs say .trigger bubbles the DOM wtf does that mean
[05:51:15] <seutje> formers: making a true wysiwyg
[05:51:27] <seutje> ?mdc bubbling @ austinbv
[05:51:38] <seutje> ?bot
[05:51:41] <austinbv> seutje: the bots gone
[05:51:45] <seutje> motherffffffff-
[05:51:49] <ElGoorf> lol
[05:51:51] <ElGoorf> italy's fucked
[05:51:52] <austinbv> haha
[05:51:54] <adamramadhan> hello how is the best way to load css dymamicly with jquery ? im looking for a asset mootools alternative
[05:51:57] <ElGoorf> oo werong chn
[05:52:03] <ElGoorf> wrong chan*
[05:53:09] <formers> seutje : have you looked at aloha ?
[05:53:22] <adamramadhan> there is no dataType for style sheet i guess, is data enough? text or html?
[05:53:24] <seutje> formers: have u seen the size of that monster?
[05:53:29] <austinbv> seutje: I read the mdc still not really sure what bubbling is
[05:53:34] <formers> seutje : hahahaha
[05:53:37] <seutje> austinbv: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[05:54:37] <seutje> austinbv: given this markup: <div><input /></div>, if u click on the input, the click event will also fire on the div
[05:54:59] <austinbv> oh ok
[05:55:06] <seutje> that's sort of it, in a nut shell
[05:55:09] <austinbv> yeah thanks the quirks mode is what i need
[05:55:20] <seutje> quirksmode.org is the shit!
[05:55:28] <austinbv> yeah I can tell
[05:55:54] <austinbv> I am writing a jq plugin for jasmine that emulates user interaction with the event fires
[05:56:03] <seutje> jasmine?
[05:56:12] <austinbv> seems to work pretty well just wasn't sure about the bubbles
[05:56:25] <austinbv> http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/
[05:56:40] <austinbv> spec testing for JS
[05:57:37] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, http://jsfiddle.net/zZX37/2/ only way i could get it to work
[05:57:59] <seutje> ouch
[05:58:06] <blackspotwiggins> yeah
[05:58:17] <seutje> wanna avoid that, but might be forced to move towards that anyway
[05:58:31] <seutje> coz right now, whilst my ajax call is saving the shizzle, u can still edit it
[05:59:04] <seutje> and ideally, I'd want to grab a filtered return from the backend and replace whatever is in there with the filtered content, so might wanna remove contenteditable for a sec anyway, during the saving process
[05:59:23] <seutje> anyway, thanks for the idea :)
[05:59:34] <austinbv> blackspotwiggins: doesnt work for me
[05:59:41] <austinbv> unless you are supposed to keep focus out
[05:59:55] <formers> put in a bug report
[06:00:13] <formers> to chrome
[06:01:21] <blackspotwiggins> crbug.com
[06:02:15] <ShawnRisk> How come this code: http://pastebin.com/pixkmPrx hides the content when I first visit the page, but when I click the button to search it didn't show up the content afterwards?
[06:02:36] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=89026 might be related
[06:03:03] <seutje> heh, exact same one I ended up at :)
[06:03:53] <blackspotwiggins> there are some workareounds there as well
[06:04:59] <seutje> yea, but considering it regains focus as soon as u start typing, this isn't a blocker for me
[06:05:08] <seutje> it just threw me off :P
[06:06:24] <blackspotwiggins> accidental ctrl-v -> everything is fucked
[06:08:03] <drOptimize> Good Morning.
[06:10:49] <maxmac> Why does http://pastebin.com/hk7jMszj leav me with an empty StoreDropDownHidden?
[06:12:02] <quicksilver> maxmac: because appending something removes it from its current location
[06:12:05] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my problem?
[06:12:18] <maxmac> oh, did not know that. What should i use instead?
[06:12:29] <quicksilver> clone it first.
[06:12:35] <quicksilver> and read the docs :P http://api.jquery.com/append/
[06:13:20] <maxmac> thanks!
[06:15:17] <maxmac> you're awesome
[06:16:30] <macheleon> I'm using setTimeout and clearTimeout for a periodic .animate(), which works fine, but when I go to another browser tab for a while and then return to the original one with the .animate() then it goes nuts like it's stored up all the animations while I've been gone. How to fix that?
[06:16:44] <ShawnRisk> How come this code: http://pastebin.com/pixkmPrxÂ hides the content when I first visit the page, but when I click the button to search it didn't show up the content afterwards?
[06:17:28] <macheleon> I know about .delay() but it doesn't have a cancel method
[06:18:06] <mokush> is there a way to return a custom object from a custom event attached with bind? like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5BRwf/
[06:21:10] <kborchers> macheleon: that is a browser issue which you will have to work around. there is a big discussion among the jQuery team about what to do about that issue. here is one way someone has worked around it not sure if it's cross browser but seems like it would work http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5766263/run-settimeout-only-when-tab-is-active
[06:22:06] <Aamir> Any better of doing:   var gravity = $(this).hasClass('s') ? 's' : $(this).hasClass('e') ? 'e' : $(this).hasClass('w') ? 'w' : 'n';
[06:22:09] <ShawnRisk> hi kborchers
[06:22:10] <Aamir> ?
[06:22:37] <kborchers> ?hey @ ShawnRisk
[06:22:43] <DukeDrake> macheleon: maybe combine clearTimeout and setTimeout whith checking if window loses focus?
[06:22:45] <kborchers> oh sleepy bot
[06:22:49] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: hey
[06:22:51] <mbrevda> looking for a clean way to break a list of files paths (/some/path/to /some/file) down to an array or object. Ideas?
[06:22:52] <djQuery> kborchers: this is what I got it down to button.button({icons: props.icons, text: props.iconText});
[06:22:56] <DukeDrake> i.e. turn the animation off, when you change a tab?
[06:22:57] <blackspotwiggins> bot is ded
[06:23:08] <grid_> hey djquery
[06:23:18] <macheleon> DukeDrake: I am, using some code that 'almost' always catches it .. but not always.
[06:23:45] <djQuery> hey
[06:23:50] <DukeDrake> I actually don't know the trigger for out of focus ...
[06:24:08] <djQuery> DukeDrake: see ?blur
[06:24:24] <DukeDrake> ah =)
[06:24:24] <kborchers> djQuery: bot go bye bye
[06:24:27] <macheleon> thanks kborchers I will look into that. This is for a homegrown slideshow .. do established slideshow plugins suffer from this problem?
[06:24:34] <djQuery> DukeDrake: or if its not an input see ?mouseleave
[06:24:48] <djQuery> kborchers: well he can look it up then
[06:24:53] <kborchers> yep
[06:25:15] <DukeDrake> djQuery: it's about how to stop a timer when the window loses focus ;)
[06:25:24] <kborchers> macheleon: not sure but you can look at their demos and test. i would imagine they would have this problem unless they already worked around it
[06:25:46] <Woet> $(window).blur(function(){ clearTimeout(timer); });
[06:25:59] <DukeDrake> check
[06:26:28] <macheleon> kborchers: doing that now, it'll be good to know
[06:27:29] <macheleon> .mouseleave() on the window you say
[06:27:39] <grid_> i want to declare .autocomplete( "close" ) (it comes with jquery ui autocomplete, it should bring it back to a normal state) i want to declare it when i close my jquery ui dialog, but somehow the screen will mess up, do i first need to make another function of it?
[06:27:45] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: just curious if you saw my problem?
[06:27:48] <kborchers> djQuery: not sure i like the name iconText but if you're going to submit another pull you should probably implement all of the button options right?
[06:27:58] <seutje> Aamir: if it has all 3 classes, u still wanna just catch 's'?
[06:28:16] <kborchers> djQuery: also i'm not looking at the code now but how does that work if you want different icons on different buttons?
[06:28:22] <djQuery> kborchers: me neither but its a naming conflict between the 2
[06:28:45] <djQuery> kborchers: it works fine because thats inside a .each loop
[06:28:53] <Aamir> seutje:  it should not class. it can have one of s, n, w, e and other classes
[06:29:04] <Aamir> it worked but wondering if there is a better way
[06:29:13] <kborchers> djQuery: right, cool
[06:29:22] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: no, i think i joined after you posted it
[06:29:33] <djQuery> got a better name ? havent submitted this one yet
[06:29:46] <Aamir> http://gyazo.com/a0df4a4fcdbe1be678c0a8662025e01a.png
[06:29:59] <seutje> Aamir: hmz, dunno, making an array and looping over it is prolly more costly, right?
[06:30:04] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I posted it again after you entered
[06:30:26] <seutje> Aamir: u can at least cache $(this) :P
[06:30:30] <Aamir> seutje: yes i think this method is simpler than making an Array
[06:30:30] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: gotcha ... looking
[06:30:38] <Aamir> lol yes :)
[06:31:16] <seutje> Aamir: do I want to know what $.fn.tipsy does? :P
[06:31:41] <Aamir> seutje:  No but http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/#download
[06:32:05] <seutje> aaah
[06:32:19] <kborchers> djQuery: maybe i haven't had enough coffee. where does dialog use text? for the title?
[06:32:22] <seutje> was hoping it would make things blurry and waving from left to right
[06:32:31] <kborchers> is that the conflict?
[06:32:41] <seutje> guess that's more something for $.fn.drunk
[06:33:12] <Aamir> :)
[06:34:04] <JimXL1> I'd like to have a jqgrid start with the last page of data.  I tried setting the pager pgtxt attribute, but that didn't work.
[06:34:58] <djQuery> kborchers: for the text of the button it is equivalent to label in button
[06:35:18] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: would be helpful if you could pull those pieces out into a fiddle. nothing is jumping out at me in that small piece of code
[06:35:53] <djQuery> ShawnRisk: jsbin rocks as well
[06:36:17] <seutje> jsbin can I can use jsbin on my phone, jsfiddle... not so much
[06:36:34] <macheleon> kborchers: that SO link is proving interesting, it seems to work in IE even. I have been using a somewhat similar thing that uses if (/*@cc_on!@*/false) { document.onfocusout = onBlur; } and isn't totally stable
[06:36:36] <djQuery> seutje: giat
[06:36:41] <seutje> something went wrong with that sentence
[06:36:50] <kborchers> djQuery: oh right, couldn't you just use buttonText implying it comes from the button options. that way it's obvious they do the same thing but no naming conflict?
[06:37:33] <djQuery> kborchers: that would kinda make me think that it is setting the text of the button not a boolean to hide the text
[06:37:38] <JimXL1>  I'd like to have a jqgrid start with the last page of data.  I tried setting the pager pgtxt attribute, but that didn't work.
[06:38:01] <djQuery> kborchers: how bout boolText
[06:38:47] <kborchers> djQuery: i guess it would help if i paid attention to what text actually does in button :/  i would go with showText
[06:43:24] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I can't remember get this working in a jsfiddle as there is code doing the search which would make this impossible to do.  All I want to do is have this hidden on page view and then when I click a button and the page reloads show this.
[06:43:56] <phobia> Hi :) I got a setInterval(myfunc, 1500) that triggers a function that does $('#foo').animate('left', newPos); The problem is that if I open another tab in the browser, stay there for a few seconds, then go back the animation goes nuts making up for lost time. Any idea what's going on, and how I can fix it?
[06:44:49] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: wait, so the problem is that it's hidden when the page reloads?
[06:45:23] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: yep
[06:45:46] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: but you're telling it to hide when the page loads. what else would it do?
[06:45:50] <grid_> djQuery: i run a jquery ui dialog, the iframe i get inside this dialog must get back to its normal state when i close the dialog, in order to reopen it, atleast i think i need with jquery ui autocomplete to reset my combobox .autocomplete( "close" ) ?
[06:46:11] <grid_> i tried it to declare it
[06:46:53] <kborchers> phobia: that's funny, just helped someone else with that. it's a browser issue that you have to work around. try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5766263/run-settimeout-only-when-tab-is-active
[06:47:09] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: meaning?
[06:47:25] <phobia> kborchers: ah, thanks! :D
[06:47:33] <macheleon> hah timing kborchers, phobia
[06:47:38] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: when you reload the page this code runs again jQuery('div.view-bursary .view-content').hide();
[06:47:45] <seutje> crap, I has another problem, I have an element with an onfocusout handler, when I click one of the control buttons, the element loses focus and its onfocusout is fired, how can I prevent this, but only when something within a certain container is clicked?
[06:48:26] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: oh, how do I fix this?
[06:49:49] <macheleon> seutje: would putting a conditional in a function fired by onfocusout that checks which container is clicked work?
[06:49:57] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i would say use ajax
[06:50:06] <seutje> macheleon: can't check which container is clicked
[06:50:06] <kborchers> without seeing the rest of your code
[06:50:27] <seutje> the event passed to the onfocusout handler doesn't contain any reference to where the focus went
[06:50:56] <alaing> would someone be so kind as to help me with a css floating issue I'm experiencing. #css doesn't seem to be of any help
[06:51:05] <seutje> #css is never any help
[06:51:10] <seutje> sup?
[06:51:22] <JimXL1> #php is worse
[06:51:26] <seutje> qft
[06:51:54] <seutje> alaing: what seems to be the problem?
[06:52:03] <grid_> djQuery: what would you to choose to bring the iframe back to it's normal state? it's inside a jquery ui dialog, or would you use if you use a jquery ui combobox some custom function?
[06:52:09] <alaing> seutje: thanks, I've search stackover flow and found this issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/266015/css-floats-how-do-i-keep-them-on-one-line
[06:52:26] <alaing> I'm trying to float two divs next to each other
[06:53:12] <alaing> when i resize my window in IE the right div drops below the left conent but in FF they stay on the same line and FF just provides a scroll bar
[06:53:19] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: the code is crazy but here is the actually page: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/students/Awards/search
[06:53:25] <macheleon> seutje: that's what I mean, fire a function with onfocusout, and put a conditional in the function that checks .click() on the other containers ... mind I might not be understanding your situation so apologies if I'm not
[06:55:42] <ximarin> question: i created some tabs using .tabs. How can i fire an event when I click on a tab with a specific id? $("#theTab").click... does not work
[06:55:56] <alaing> I've tried the solution giving in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/266015/css-floats-how-do-i-keep-them-on-one-line but in IE my content is now always dropped below the floated div. I added aborder around to see what it was doing and it seems like my floating divs contain ("which uses the minwidth hack") is setting the width to 100%
[06:56:06] <alaing> instead of my 500px
[06:56:31] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: definitely just submit that form with AJAX and then put the result in the div, then show it. i would pull your back end search code out into a separate file so that it doesn't return the rest of the page, just the contents of the div
[06:57:16] <djQuery> grid_: huh?
[06:57:21] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: okay but I want to hide this on pageview
[06:57:36] <kborchers> what are you trying to hide?
[06:57:40] <alaing> ximarin: give me a sec i did somethign similar not to long again
[06:57:47] <xzuttz> Hello. I have a click event handler on a button. I would like to validate weather a textbox is empty and consists of digits, when the button is clicked, before execute a function. How can i accomplish this with jQuery validation?
[06:57:58] <grid_> djQuery: nevermind, i try to explain it later again :)
[06:58:05] <ximarin> alaing: great, i would appreciate any help :)
[06:58:08] <djQuery> grid_: you mean the way that dialog rips it from where it currently is and appends it to the document
[06:58:25] <GreyTrilby> xzuttz - are you using the validate.js plugin?
[06:58:27] <grid_> djQuery: thats right
[06:58:42] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: you see below the submit button there is content?  I am trying to hide everything there.
[06:58:51] <xzuttz> GreyTrilby: Yes
[06:59:05] <GreyTrilby> what code do you have so far?
[06:59:24] <xzuttz> GreyTrilby: I will put it on jsfiddle just a sec
[06:59:28] <dirkpennings> Guys, when using a selector for multiple items (like 25) and use .append() to all that selectors (even when they not exist), I'm getting an "stop running script?" message in IE7 + IE8.. anyone knows why or knows a workaround? using jQuery 1.5.1
[07:00:12] <alaing> ximarin: well theres two ways you can do it. you could delegate a click event on the parent element or you can hook into ui tabs custom event http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ go to events tabs and expand "select" to see an example
[07:01:04] <GreyTrilby> @ximarin - what're you trying to do?
[07:02:12] <alaing> ximarin: look on the overview tab as well under "events" you need to pass in ui.tab for the selected tab which you cna then pick out if the id is foo and then run whatever you want
[07:02:15] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: where is that JS in this page?
[07:02:20] <alaing> seutje: ?
[07:02:37] <xzuttz> GreyTrilby: http://jsfiddle.net/YqYm8/
[07:03:15] <ximarin> ah i see, I'm gonna try this out
[07:03:38] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: if you don't see I am using Drupal and Views
[07:03:48] <alaing> ximarin: hope that helps you
[07:03:52] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: that is my biggest issue with Drupal ... it drops in so much shit that you can't find anything you're looking for
[07:04:21] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I totally understand
[07:05:00] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: but that doesn't answer my question ... where can i find that piece of JS you posted for help. what file?
[07:05:32] <xzuttz> GreyTrilby: Edit - http://jsfiddle.net/YqYm8/1/
[07:05:38] <GreyTrilby> xzuttz - this should help for a start.. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[07:07:30] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: it looks like you are using AJAX for that form so the page does not reload.
[07:08:17] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I took that out
[07:08:28] <alaing> seutje: ?
[07:08:56] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: reload as I just changed this no ajax now
[07:11:48] <GreyTrilby> xzuttz - just playing your fiddle - won't be long
[07:14:29] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i am not going to be much help moving forward. you need to put the hiding part of your code back in, change it back to AJAX (hopefully you're doing that and Drupal isn't doing it for you), in the AJAX success, show the content. from there you have to figure it out as i don't have time to dig through a Drupal mess and do it for you
[07:14:56] <xzuttz> GreyTrilby: Does the validate plugin only work on submit?
[07:15:01] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: no worries, thanks for your help
[07:15:37] <kborchers> xzuttz: no, you can call .validate() any time you want
[07:15:49] <GreyTrilby> beat me to it - cheers kborchers
[07:15:56] <kborchers> ;)
[07:16:10] <GreyTrilby> kborchers - can't find the documentation - how do you make it validate against numbers only?
[07:16:18] <kborchers> i think the coffee is finally kicking in
[07:17:14] <kborchers> GreyTrilby: are you using classes for required etc. ?
[07:17:30] <GreyTrilby> not me guv, it's xzuttz
[07:17:56] <kborchers> duh
[07:18:11] <kborchers> xzuttz: you can just add a class called number and it will require numbers in that field
[07:18:50] <seutje> macheleon: uhm, what? check click within an onfocusout handler?
[07:18:58] <seutje> how exactly does that work?
[07:19:06] <kborchers> xzuttz: or if you're using rules, you would say number: true
[07:19:30] <kborchers> xzuttz: GreyTrilby: heres the docs http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[07:19:41] <alaing> seutje: did you see my css posts?
[07:20:18] <GreyTrilby> number: true - that's what I was after - can never find that kinda stuff - hate the jquery docs
[07:21:31] <kborchers> GreyTrilby: i think the docs are pretty straight forward ... easiest way to find stuff though is to google it just google "jquery validation" and the plugin page is first result and doc is second
[07:22:12] <kborchers> GreyTrilby: google jquery ajax and the first result is the doc for .ajax() ... you get the idea
[07:22:13] <DevBrPb> hi to all, anybody know how get the data, values in exeternal content url in table, don't have div or id in table, i try simple_html_dom but don't work. i want filter the values in table filter to date...
[07:22:30] <xzuttz> kborchers: I see. I have used it before, with forms. And it works fine. But i havent used it outside forms, so thats where im having trouble. Also i am new to jQuery.
[07:22:58] <kborchers> xzuttz: why are you using it outside of a form ... what purpose does it serve?
[07:23:37] <GreyTrilby> This is what I've come up with so far... http://jsfiddle.net/YqYm8/4/
[07:23:46] <xzuttz> kborchers: I have a jQuery script that adds a dynamic table to a form. I need to validate if an input box is not empty and is digits, because it specifies how many rows to add to the table
[07:23:49] <GreyTrilby> Sadly I need to bail
[07:24:08] <GreyTrilby> I think kborchers will be more help than me (although I'm pretty sure I've done the hard work already ;)
[07:24:12] <GreyTrilby> good luck!
[07:24:51] <ip-route> in <ul><li>aa <ul><li> ccc </li></ul> </li> <li>bbbb</li> </ul>, how select all 'li' main without 'li' children? (<li><aa/li> AND <li>bbbb</li>) ?
[07:25:09] <bartek> Hi there. Is there some built-in functionality I should look at for cancelling multiple ajax requests before another one is finished? Or do I have to build this myself?
[07:26:13] <ximarin> alaing: this worked out great, thx :)
[07:27:28] <alaing> ximarin: great thanks for letting me know
[07:27:34] <ximarin> another problem; my tables are much wider than the tabs they are in. The tab only expands to the width of the screen and squeezes my table-cells. the cells all have a fixed width and the table-layout also is fixed.
[07:27:54] <ximarin> how can i get the tab to expand to the right if the content is wider than itself?
[07:28:51] <xzuttz> kborchers: GreyTrilby made this but it isnt working: http://jsfiddle.net/YqYm8/4/ -do you see the error?
[07:28:56] <gho5t> Is there a way to style the scrollbars in jqGrid?
[07:29:00] <kborchers> bartek: believe you have to do that yourself but should be pretty easy. just set a flag when the first request starts, then don't allow others until the flag is turned off when the first request completes
[07:29:53] <bartek> kborchers: Yup, seems simple .. just didn't want to write the extra code, thanks! :-)
[07:32:08] <alaing> ximarin: thats a css issue
[07:35:11] <geekbuntu> xzuttz, you have it setup with mootools?  also, you call a function and it isn't there(?)
[07:36:27] <xzuttz> geekbuntu: I just didnt show the function but it is there. First time i use jsfiddle
[07:36:52] <kborchers> xzuttz: this doesn't work because validate isn't available in the fiddle. hopefully gets you on the right track http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YqYm8/5/
[07:37:00] <ximarin> alaing: I know, but I dont find it. the structure is: tab-div > ul > li > table (fixed) > tbody > tr > td (width:xxx). Thats all css related to the width
[07:37:38] <kborchers> xzuttz: not sure but you may still need to wrap a form around the text input and call validate on the form but that shouldn't be a big deal if it's necessary
[07:38:42] <xzuttz> kborchers: Ill give it a try thanks for the help :)
[07:39:26] <kborchers> xzuttz: sorry, forgot to change one thing http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YqYm8/6/
[07:41:41] <xzuttz> kborchers: Not working ill try adding a form
[07:42:21] <kborchers> xzuttz: then you'll need to change $("#text").validate({  to  $("#yourFormID").validate({
[07:42:32] <xzuttz> kborchers: cool thanks :)
[07:43:36] <eric_lewis> is $(document).ready the same as body onload?
[07:44:34] <quicksilver> eric_lewis: similar but not the same. see the docs.
[07:47:11] <sadmicrowave> ?ready @ eric_lewis
[07:47:23] <sadmicrowave> bot-t you have betrayed me!
[07:47:46] <quicksilver> bot-t has betrayed us all, sadmicrowave
[07:47:56] <quicksilver> I heard he's hanging out in a VBScript channel now
[07:47:58] <sadmicrowave> bot-t when you sign back in I'm going to give you a peace of my mind
[07:48:14] <sadmicrowave> traitor!
[07:48:27] * geekbuntu bot-t is packing his bags...
[07:48:40] <sadmicrowave> geekbuntu, is he leaving on a jet plane?
[07:48:48] <geekbuntu> bicycle - he's poor
[07:49:13] <sadmicrowave> does he at least have baseball cards in the spokes?
[07:49:27] <geekbuntu> and an annoying thumbringer
[07:49:49] * alaing wonders what would happen if I stuck my laptop in a microwave
[07:49:58] <sadmicrowave> alaing, it would be sad....
[07:49:58] * geekbuntu it gets more power
[07:50:03] * geekbuntu to it
[07:50:14] <alaing> geekbuntu: i like your thinking :P
[07:50:24] <blackspotwiggins> try with a cd
[07:50:33] * geekbuntu there is a dude on youtube that puts everything in a microwave
[07:50:33] <sadmicrowave> thats what happened to me...thats why I'm sad....I don't want to talk about it....too painful
[07:50:36] * geekbuntu fries it
[07:50:53] * geekbuntu you need MICRO-therapy
[07:50:53] <sadmicrowave> try it with a cat!
[07:51:00] * geekbuntu cats are too quick
[07:51:05] <alaing> a biut of salt and pepper and I bet my laptop would be quiet tasty
[07:51:06] * geekbuntu use a turtle
[07:51:12] <sadmicrowave> try it with a hobo
[07:51:18] <alaing> 30min on high power should about it
[07:51:21] <sadmicrowave> they arn't quick at all
[07:51:33] <geekbuntu> hobos don't fit
[07:51:38] <geekbuntu> unless they're exjockeys
[07:51:55] <sadmicrowave> time to buy an industrial microwave
[07:52:10] <sadmicrowave> the size of a walk-in closet
[07:52:13] <blackspotwiggins> just chill in front of a radar dish
[07:52:44] <sadmicrowave> little known make-believe fact, microwave radiation lowers sperm count
[07:52:54] <g0rd0n> i have a form which has some time fields, and i need to do some calculations on thos fields, like time diff and decimal representation also... what would be the best approach? is there a jquery plugin that suites?
[07:53:16] <blackspotwiggins> sadmicrowave, it also lowers alive cell count
[07:53:22] <geekbuntu> sadmicrowave, at least cops cannot reproduce
[07:53:22] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:53:56] <blackspotwiggins> g0rd0n, no really simple way
[07:54:14] <blackspotwiggins> parse the inputs, you can use timestamps for diffs/calculations
[07:54:35] <g0rd0n> yeah that's what i thought :P
[07:54:58] <blackspotwiggins> beware of dst tho
[07:55:01] <blackspotwiggins> that shit will fuck you up
[07:55:13] <sadmicrowave> I work in an Alcatel-Lucent manufacturing facility where we create, assemble, and tune the microwave radio infrastructures of large companies like Verizon and AT&T....where does that put me on the sperm adjustment rictor scale?
[07:55:15] <nascro> @sadmicrowave well done on the map. you knocked that thing out!
[07:55:23] <g0rd0n> oh it's just in HH:MM format
[07:55:24] <blackspotwiggins> sometimes i think dst was invented just to troll all engineers for eternity
[07:55:33] <g0rd0n> yeah
[07:55:50] <blackspotwiggins> g0rd0n, so if there's 23:30 and 00:30 is the diff 1hr or 23hrs?
[07:55:52] <g0rd0n> we should all have the same time in the world
[07:55:52] <blackspotwiggins> ;)
[07:55:58] <g0rd0n> and just wake up and go to sleep at different times
[07:56:05] <sadmicrowave> nascro, :)
[07:56:22] <g0rd0n> blackspotwiggins: heh, that won't happen in my case, but i will build some check
[07:56:30] <nascro> @sadmicrowave @kborchers isn't there a giant Lucent building in Naperville off of 88 and Naperville Rd.?
[07:56:32] <blackspotwiggins> that's why you need date component as well
[07:56:37] <blackspotwiggins> and
[07:56:40] <blackspotwiggins> you still have dst
[07:56:41] <nascro> Not even sure if it's still in use.
[07:56:43] <sadmicrowave> nascro, yes
[07:56:56] <nascro> @sadmicrowave is that where you work?
[07:56:59] <sadmicrowave> that is a main routing facility for North America
[07:57:00] <blackspotwiggins> like 02:59 -> next minute is 04:00 not 03:00
[07:57:02] <sadmicrowave> no
[07:57:03] <blackspotwiggins> in some cases
[07:57:22] <blackspotwiggins> or it'll be 02:00 again :)
[07:57:24] <alaing> could someone help me with a css issue i;m having #css not being of any help
[07:57:40] <sadmicrowave> nascro, no I don't work there
[07:57:48] <alaing> http://jsbin.com/awijew/4/edit#preview
[07:58:03] <alaing> in ie resize as soon as you get to a long word it drops but in ff you get a scroll bar
[07:58:23] <alaing> i need the divs to be next to each other like FF
[07:58:56] <geekbuntu> alaing, i do not know the answer to your question, but do you realize that jquery was made to get past hurdles like this?
[07:59:03] <geekbuntu> (ur using getelementbyid)
[08:00:46] <alaing> lol
[08:00:53] <alaing> no ignore the js part
[08:02:07] <nascro> @sadmicrowave I was going to say, it's a small world. Multiple folks in here from Illinois.
[08:02:29] <alaing> ok updated http://jsbin.com/awijew/6
[08:03:31] <sadmicrowave> nascro, I'm from TX
[08:03:53] <sadmicrowave> I just know about most of our plants...especially the ones still critical to operations
[08:04:04] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: My brother lived in San Antonio for a while. I was there last June.
[08:04:18] <nascro> @sadmicrowave Friend of mine lives in Austin
[08:04:18] <sadmicrowave> nice
[08:04:45] <kborchers> nascro: yes, there is a lucent building there to answer your question ... my son goes to their affiliated daycare across the street
[08:05:11] <sadmicrowave> cool
[08:05:25] <nascro> @kborchers Cool. I used to live in AMLI over there off of Butterfield and Naperville Rd.
[08:05:27] * geekbuntu is illinois an actual state?
[08:05:31] * geekbuntu o.0
[08:05:40] <kborchers> it's pretty sweet, they have computer labs and science labs with lab coats for the older kids
[08:05:57] <TimMc> OK, I'm trying to convert onclick='filterBy("some-id-goes-here")' into proper unobtrusive stuff. Eventually it will be a regular link, but until then, how should I get the ID information into the event handler?
[08:06:04] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, what color are the lab coats?
[08:06:11] <kborchers> just white
[08:06:16] <nascro> @*geekbuntu I bet you pronounce it "Illinoise"
[08:06:19] <geekbuntu> do the sleeves tie?
[08:06:19] <nascro> ;)
[08:06:21] <sadmicrowave> damn I wish ours were white, we have blue ones
[08:06:30] <TimMc> I'd be inclined to just slap it into a random element attribute and harvest it from there, but that seems slightly hacky.
[08:06:45] <nascro> @kborchers my son is too young, but sounds cool and nerdy
[08:06:46] <geekbuntu> nascro, i'm from kentucky - if we say it close to right - be impressed
[08:07:06] <sadmicrowave> geekbuntu, yea our lab coat cuffs have snap buttons
[08:07:32] <nascro> @geekbuntu haha! word. I've only been through Kentucky, haven't interacted with the natives much :)
[08:07:33] <geekbuntu> sadmicrowave, i was wondering if mr illinoise's labcoats were straight jackets (sleeves tie behind back)
[08:07:44] <sadmicrowave> oooh
[08:07:47] <sadmicrowave> :P
[08:07:51] <geekbuntu> nascro, my mother smuggled me out at 6 months old - never went back
[08:08:07] <nascro> @geekbuntu Was reading "Outliers" and they were talking about Kentucky. Interestting stuff...
[08:08:10] <geekbuntu> grew up in germany, texas and new york mostly
[08:08:23] <nascro> @geekbuntu lucky you. there are only a few openings on the border.
[08:08:32] <geekbuntu> most kentuckians are very simple hardworking people - freaking intense though
[08:08:43] <geekbuntu> (VERY intense)
[08:08:49] <geekbuntu> moonshine is an art form
[08:10:14] <nascro> @geekbuntu yeah, that's what Outliers was talking about. It really is interesting. A lot of Irish background influenced much of the attitude that Kentucky is now known for.
[08:10:29] <nascro> @geekbuntu or so Malcom Gladwell says
[08:10:52] <mister> hi guys, could you give me some help on running some code on all browsers except for webkit on iphone?
[08:10:59] <geekbuntu> nascro, my mom didn't want me to grow up with the limited mindset... (true maternal love)
[08:11:37] <nascro> @geekbuntu understandable. I think it's good to move around no matter where you're from.
[08:11:50] <nascro> @geekbuntu that said, I've lived in Illinois most of my life.
[08:12:02] <nascro> @geekbuntu travel a lot, though. also good for you.
[08:12:07] <geekbuntu> nascro, living in germany 13 years - i met people from all over the world... really opens a persons mind
[08:12:23] <geekbuntu> learning to speak german while hungry helps too
[08:12:31] <geekbuntu> good motivator
[08:13:21] <nascro> @geekbuntu Wow
[08:13:27] <geekbuntu> i don't know if it will help anyone, but this appears to be the shiznit: http://downloads.sencha.com/extras/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf
[08:13:33] <nascro> @geekbuntu met some folks from Germany that were in Montana a couple of weeks ago.
[08:13:38] <geekbuntu> had some conflicting code in jq-ui this morning
[08:13:39] <nascro> @geekbuntu older couple
[08:13:51] <geekbuntu> nascro, most germans are extremely cool people
[08:14:06] <nascro> @geekbuntu Every German I've met has been
[08:15:01] <geekbuntu> nascro, the only thing i've found in common with germans is they believe in public nudity/open sex, legalizing public drunkenness and drugs should be legalized because it flushes the scum out of the darkness (no blackmarkets)
[08:16:09] <nascro> @geekbuntu sounds conservative
[08:16:18] <geekbuntu> && if you ever visit amsterdam/holland - you can order a nickle bag and a big mac off the same menu
[08:17:20] * geekbuntu nascro they're all republicans obviously
[08:17:23] <nascro> @geekbuntu haven't spent much time overseas unfortunately. Would love to, though.
[08:17:29] <nascro> @geekbuntu clearly
[08:17:36] <geekbuntu> go in oktober
[08:17:39] <geekbuntu> (will change your life)
[08:18:01] <gho5t> why does jscrollpane tell you to initialize it in an anonymous function rather than just calling $('.scroll-pane').jScrollPane();  ? http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[08:18:10] <nascro> @geekbuntu I'm not sure I want my life to be changed <i>in that way</i>
[08:18:24] <geekbuntu> nascro, you'll never drink another american beer
[08:19:31] <nascro> @geekbuntu I am sure you're right. Ignorance is bliss?
[08:19:53] <tjholowaychuk> for stuff like $('<li>' + blah + '</li>') does anyone hate the idea of sprintf style? $('<li>%s</li>', blah) etc
[08:19:53] <geekbuntu> sam adams is as close as i've found here
[08:20:44] <gho5t> why does jscrollpane tell you to initialize it in an anonymous function rather than just calling $('.scroll-pane').jScrollPane();  ? http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[08:20:49] <gho5t> p.s. bud light rules
[08:21:33] <nascro> @geekubuntu I typically stick with Sierra Nevada and Blue Moon if I'm drinking at all.
[08:21:34] <Adjames> I've built funtionality using .keydown to make an alertbox popup when i press the down key.  However, what I'd like to do is make the current focus to move down to the next item like crtl + tab does.  Any thoughts or resources to figure this out?
[08:22:39] * geekbuntu nascro blue moon is pretty good stuff - pale's are generally 'break fluid tasting though'
[08:23:14] <nascro> @geekbuntu what does that mean?
[08:24:06] <geekbuntu> nascro, pale ale's tend to lose the beer taste and begin to taste like lighter fluid (imo)
[08:24:31] <nascro> @geekbuntu maybe you're drinking too many?
[08:24:31] <Adjames>  Or is it possible that when the down arrow is pressed to scriptivly call shiftkey plus crtl key?
[08:24:32] <nascro> :)
[08:25:44] <geekbuntu> nascro, that's a distinct possibility
[08:25:55] <geekbuntu> nascro, i'm trying to be paul_irish
[08:26:03] <nascro> @geekbuntu good luck
[08:26:12] <nascro> <- Back in a bit.
[08:27:41] <seutje> alaing: sry, got a lil preoccupied and now I gotta bounce :x
[08:28:18] <bartek> What's the proper way to check on an $.ajax request when it's finished? I want to basically check its state (I store the request in a var), to see if it's complete, wether it was a success or a failure. Seems. readyState might be one way, but not sure how that works
[08:29:58] <TimMc> bartek: I think you can declare separate onSuccess and onFailure callbacks.
[08:32:39] <gho5t> why does jscrollpane tell you to initialize it in an anonymous function rather than just calling $('.scroll-pane').jScrollPane();  ? http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[08:33:56] <sean`> gho5t, it isn't telling you to do that
[08:34:04] <sean`> it's tellig y ou to call after domready event
[08:34:13] <sean`> see the anonymous function is wrapped with $()
[08:34:24] <sean`> $(function () { .. this will run when the dom is ready .. });
[08:34:46] <peol> ^- this is why i never recommend short-handing .ready
[08:34:53] <sean`> FU
[08:34:57] <sean`> shorthand++
[08:35:13] <sean`> :p
[08:35:31] <Usse> anyone know a reg exp to match youtube link?
[08:35:34] <peol> $ is too easy to miss, perhaps jQuery(fn); in that case
[08:36:06] <nail_> not always true, my gf hilights on '$'s
[08:36:06] <gho5t> ohh
[08:36:20] <gho5t> sean`: so that anonymous function is really just short-hand for document ready?
[08:36:30] <peol> gho5t: yes
[08:36:47] <sean`> peol, yeah, I prefer jQuery ( .. )
[08:36:56] <sean`> shorthandign with the $ is not koole man
[08:37:01] <peol> ;p
[08:37:07] <sean`> Usse, you can find multiple on the interwebz
[08:37:07] <gho5t> why do ppl prefer that
[08:37:14] <gho5t> so noobs like me can be confused?
[08:37:28] <sean`> gho5t, because it looks cooler, or they are lazy
[08:37:46] <gho5t> i see some scripts with that all over the place when they could've just wrapped it in one document.ready
[08:38:25] <peol> i prefer declaring fn's earlier and just reference them, instead of having anonymous fn's EVERYWHERE
[08:38:26] <sunsean> Which version of jQuery would you consider more stable. v1.5.2 or v1.6.2?
[08:39:02] <johnline3> http://pastebin.com/bx7MpydG
[08:39:22] <sphinxxx> any small plugins that wlll add an opaque box to all images, displaying the alt text, on hover?
[08:39:22] <peol> ugh
[08:39:25] <johnline3> hey guys, im implementing 'if msie's' into my code
[08:39:42] <johnline3> but already notice it affects the performance in good browsers
[08:39:54] <johnline3> i guess cause they're cheacking each time if its msie
[08:39:57] <gho5t> peopl: but i'm still confused. what does that have to do with document.ready
[08:40:01] <johnline3> is there a better way
[08:40:05] <gho5t> peol
[08:40:23] <geekbuntu> sphinxxx, i heard this worked, but have not tested it http://mikelee.blogs.iconsolution.net/post/2009/10/03/Opaque-and-Rounded-Divs-using-DD_roundies.aspx
[08:40:34] <peol> gho5t: which?
[08:40:45] <gho5t> anonymous functions
[08:41:04] <gho5t> <peol> i prefer declaring fn's earlier and just reference them, instead of having anonymous fn's EVERYWHERE
[08:41:07] <ximarin> smth off topic: is anyone of you familiar with synergy? (to share screens)
[08:41:10] <peol> gho5t: $(function() {}); <-- anonymous function wrapped in $();
[08:41:16] <peol> less readability for one
[08:41:32] <mb9999> hey im having a problem with jQuery animate. Can anyone help?
[08:41:49] <peol> gho5t: e.g. function doStuff() {}; $( doStuff );
[08:42:14] <peol> mb9999: just ask, please
[08:42:42] <gho5t> i guess i just don't understand why people use anonymous functions in the first place
[08:42:55] <gho5t> is it so there aren't a ton of functions in the global namespace?
[08:43:14] <mb9999> i am animating marginLeft and it seems when it gets to a value greater than -10000px it bums out and resets to 0px
[08:43:26] <quicksilver> gho5t: why name something you're only going to use once?
[08:43:39] <quicksilver> it's just work, coming up with a name.
[08:44:00] <gho5t> ok
[08:44:10] <peol> mb9999: cross-browser or specific ones, a jsfiddle.net link would be nice
[08:44:18] <gho5t> why wrap it in a function then?
[08:44:22] <gho5t> why not just call the js
[08:44:28] <gho5t> is it because of scoping?
[08:44:38] <quicksilver> to pass it as a parameter to a function?
[08:44:44] <quicksilver> like $, or $.click, or ....
[08:45:17] <quicksilver> $('a').click(function() { ... do something on click } );
[08:45:18] <gho5t> ah
[08:45:37] <mb9999> theres like 1000 lines of code, its doing it in all browsers
[08:46:06] <gho5t> how about this line i found in my project: (function ($, undefined) {
[08:46:12] <gho5t> wth is that
[08:49:33] <newuser> hello i suppose i don't need to use jsbin for 1 line code?
[08:49:38] <larzen-wrk> anyone work with the widget factory JQuery UI piece before? I am trying to apply options to elements if the user calls create multiple times
[08:50:36] <newuser> when i use <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.6.2.min.js" /> jquery doesn't work with ie; and when i use <script></script> it does why so? sorry for noobish question btw :s
[08:50:59] <ajpiano> newuser: cause a script tag isn't a valid element to have a />
[08:51:03] <ajpiano> you have to have <script></script>
[08:51:13] <newuser> but it works in opera and others?
[08:51:51] <ajpiano> well if web development was centered around "what shit you can get away with" instead of "actually doing things right" that would be awesome
[08:52:16] <ajpiano> just do <script></script> and move on with your life, it is the right way to do it
[08:52:22] <newuser> nvm you went off topic ;) i would use <script></script>
[08:52:53] <richthegeek> ajpiano: +1
[08:57:20] <larzen-wrk> I need some help. When I call my plugin for the first time, the _create method is invoked... but not the subsequent times
[08:57:32] <larzen-wrk> this is for a widgetfactory component
[08:57:45] <larzen-wrk> is there any way I can detect if the user calls the create mehtod multiple times?
[09:03:55] <quicksilver> gho5t: that's a function taking two parameters, one called $ and one called undefined.
[09:04:07] <quicksilver> gho5t: not much is magic in javascript. Just learn the basics and be methodical.
[09:08:23] <richthegeek> is there any way to tell if a jQuery Droppable's "drop" event was from a valid/invalid drop?
[09:13:42] <Xeon06_> Is it normal that this doesn't work, or is it just me?    $("<a>").wrap("<li>")
[09:17:11] <quicksilver> Xeon06_: well it works but you can't tell its working
[09:17:19] <quicksilver> Xeon06_: .wrap doesn't return the newly wrapped object
[09:17:30] <quicksilver> so it's useless if the newly wrapped object isn't already inserted somewhere.
[09:18:13] <quicksilver> Xeon06_: see that this works - http://jsfiddle.net/yyNWp/ - but all that is logged is the <a> element. The li element is wrapped into the DOM but not returned to console.log
[09:18:50] <quicksilver> "This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes" although I agree it is a bit surprising.
[09:19:07] <phlp> $("<a>").wrap("<li>").parent()
[09:22:10] <quicksilver> phlp: does parent() work if it's not in the DOM yet?
[09:22:10] <Xeon06_> quicksilver: Wow, that's weird. Okay thanks.
[09:22:14] * quicksilver could just try it an see.
[09:22:21] <phlp> yes
[09:22:35] <quicksilver> yes.
[09:22:35] <Xeon06_> It does, just tried it out
[09:22:36] <quicksilver> :)
[09:22:39] <gnarf> quicksilver: assumint it has a parent, yet
[09:22:41] <Xeon06_> That's a good solution, thanks phpedinei
[09:22:43] <Xeon06_> Oops
[09:22:44] <quicksilver> gnarf: ofc.
[09:22:46] <Xeon06_> Damn autocomplete
[09:22:53] <Xeon06_> Thanks phlp
[09:22:54] <quicksilver> thanks phlp, indeed. today I learn something ;)
[09:23:01] <Xeon06_> Wait, I just didn't type your name right, haha
[09:23:06] <gnarf> if its the "root" node out of the dom parent() will be empty
[09:29:35] <Unode|Work> hi everyone
[09:29:56] <Unode|Work> I'm having a problem related with resizing on a dialog
[09:30:04] <Unode|Work> JQuery UI last version
[09:30:56] <Unode|Work> I include the maxHeight, maxWidth, height: 'auto', and width: 'auto' and the maxHeight is ignored
[09:31:22] <Unode|Work> only if you try to resize the dialog it will get applied
[09:31:56] <Unode|Work> in addition, I have modal: true
[09:32:47] <Unode|Work> and if the dialog is bigger than the screen size, the modal "background" will only be applied to the screen and not to the remaining area (if you scroll down, you will start to see a white background)
[09:33:01] <Unode|Work> Browser is Firefox 5
[09:33:44] <Unode|Work> can someone reproduce this?
[09:36:44] <TimMc> Best to create a publicly viewable test case.
[09:39:34] <m_e> can you select all td and th somehow like this: $('td|th')
[09:39:58] <ajpiano> $("th, td")
[09:40:18] <m_e> nice ty :)
[09:54:52] <Unode|Work> TimMc, http://jsfiddle.net/xKPfg/1/
[09:56:10] <Unode|Work> TimMc, you can see the white background on modal and if you try to resize you will see the size hiccup, then the scrollbar shows up in the dialog and you are then limited to the max, but only after trying the resize
[09:58:00] <Unode|Work> TimMc, can you reproduce it?
[09:58:49] <Unode|Work> or anyone else
[10:12:55] <jeffreyjames> a bit OT, but I ask here cause #jquery seems up on trends more than other channels...
[10:13:23] <jeffreyjames> has anyone seen any info on how to aggregate facebook photos?
[10:13:46] <jeffreyjames> I'm trying to use this: http://dev.herr-schuessler.de/jquery/popeye/demo.html
[10:13:55] <aximilation> "a bit" ? But no I haven't.
[10:14:25] <jeffreyjames> for a client, but they seem like they will probably ever know how to update their FB page
[10:14:39] <jeffreyjames> even flickr scares them
[10:14:52] <aximilation> tip: Run for your life
[10:15:06] <aximilation> or sell them management services...
[10:15:14] <jeffreyjames> yeah, this is a job that was supposed to take 2 months
[10:15:18] <jeffreyjames> ...1 year later
[10:15:23] <jeffreyjames> still not complete
[10:15:29] <jeffreyjames> their idea of content is...
[10:15:43] <jeffreyjames> "hi welcome to our site. we do things. please work with us"
[10:16:03] <jeffreyjames> </content I've gotten for the whole site>
[10:16:26] <aximilation> Make them pay for a content writer?
[10:17:01] <jeffreyjames> long story short... hiring anyone for anything is not an option
[10:17:03] <jeffreyjames> they're cheap
[10:17:10] <aximilation> Or just make the whole site with *information about the company here*      *information on how to contact here*    ....and make it go live that way :D
[10:17:11] <jeffreyjames> dont' build websites for small town churches
[10:17:16] <jeffreyjames> (is the moral)
[10:17:34] <aximilation> "If you don't give me something to put in this space this is how it goes out"
[10:17:56] <aximilation> Otherwise make a one page awesome design and leave it at that
[10:18:04] <jeffreyjames> I started this gig is a favor to a friend who worked there and then he got let go...
[10:18:23] <jeffreyjames> yeah. one page awesome design seems like a good idea
[10:18:45] <aximilation> drop the axe, whatever you do. Give them a timeline, what you need, when you need it, or else
[10:18:48] <jeffreyjames> I might just put their single line content in fancybox-es with photos so it's not so sparce and weird looking
[10:19:10] <jeffreyjames> ohhh!
[10:19:14] <jeffreyjames> expound on that
[10:19:18] <jeffreyjames> "or else"
[10:19:31] <jeffreyjames> I always want to say that but I'm not really sure what to use for a threat
[10:19:46] <jeffreyjames> "or else... I'll give you back your money"
[10:19:48] <aximilation> "I have spent XX hours going back and forth with you in email, I need to move on to new projects, if you do not provide me with content for X, Y and Z, the site will be completed without it and billed accordingly
[10:19:59] <aximilation> "
[10:20:11] <jeffreyjames> that makes sense
[10:20:33] <jeffreyjames> I was a bit zealous and ambitious in our initial meetings
[10:20:45] <aximilation> Don't let them burn through your time, this also includes communication and revision time
[10:20:59] <jeffreyjames> yeah... I flat-rated this one
[10:21:07] <jeffreyjames> you know... friend worked there, favor sort of thing
[10:21:10] <jeffreyjames> BIG mistake
[10:21:11] <aximilation> yep
[10:21:40] <jeffreyjames> I still have to figure out the google calendar API and code a custom events calendar
[10:22:06] <aximilation> Give them a deadline, anything after that, including emails, will cost them a 15 minute minimum at a fair rate, say $25-45/hr.
[10:22:26] <jeffreyjames> that sounds good.
[10:22:28] <aximilation> Without being greedy, you have to be able to make them feel the pain, pain is a good motivator
[10:23:02] <jeffreyjames> at least it's a good learning experience
[10:23:10] <jnylen> hi all, anyone know how I can get the body to not scroll when I show a jQuery UI dialog?
[10:23:11] <jeffreyjames> teaching me how to structure pricing and etc.
[10:23:34] <aximilation> If they can string you along with 2 sentence emails, half the content, and it doesn't hurt, they probably will. If they know doing that will cost them an extra $200 due to missed deadlines, too many emails, etc...guess what happens
[10:23:51] <jeffreyjames> yeah. I'
[10:23:55] <jeffreyjames> I'm going to write this down
[10:24:07] <jeffreyjames> i love the deadline, then charge concept
[10:24:18] <jeffreyjames> so simple and effective, yet it never crossed my mind
[10:24:40] <jeffreyjames> the perils of freelancing...
[10:24:56] <aximilation> Take a log of the chat, take notes. Business is business, at some point you have to value what your time is worth. From the sounds of it, if you account for communication your time spent so far is what, $5/hr?
[10:25:12] <TimMc> Unode|Work: Not exactly what you said, but yes, the constraints are being ignored at creation.
[10:25:14] <aximilation> Give them the raw metrics, don't be a douche, but don't be a pushover
[10:25:28] <TimMc> Unode|Work: Firefox 3.6.18
[10:25:42] <Unode|Work> TimMc, seems like this is a known problem http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4820
[10:25:45] <jeffreyjames> 5 an hour or less... *grumble*
[10:26:05] <Unode|Work> TimMc, no fix available though
[10:28:48] <aximilation> 30 emails x 15-25 minutes + 5 10 minute voice calls + 12 hours development time + whatever = 25 Hours, (probably more) say you bid the project at $800 (it sounds like less), with those numbers you're at $32/hr...fair enough for starting out, but I doubt you have those numbers, chances are the money is half that and the time is double that. ($8/hr?)
[10:29:40] <jeffreyjames> 800 exactly actually
[10:30:24] <jeffreyjames> I just made them pay the balance before I would continue
[10:30:35] <jnylen> hi all, anyone know how I can get the body to not scroll when I show a jQuery UI dialog?
[10:30:39] <jeffreyjames> the fact they they didn't have a problem with it is a good sign
[10:30:41] <jnylen> or, how to cancel scroll events in general
[10:30:51] <aximilation> ok fair enough, the time I noted accounts for about a month or so of development and communication, where are you with the 1yr mark?
[10:32:01] <jeffreyjames> it's been over a year now, but I've just set it aside until they would email me saying "hows the site coming?" to which I would reply "give me content."
[10:32:08] <aximilation> lol
[10:32:12] <jeffreyjames> it's basically been those two emails back n forth for a year
[10:32:28] <jeffreyjames> and though I could just design something and pop in a CMS
[10:32:30] <aximilation> yea, that time may not be worth much, but it does add up.
[10:32:40] <jeffreyjames> I don't want to overbuild or underbuild it
[10:33:00] <aximilation> You're probably good with static page and all their info on the front page
[10:33:01] <jeffreyjames> it does. they are the least tech savvy people I've ever seen
[10:33:13] <jeffreyjames> so I have to make screencasts of how to sign up for a flickr account
[10:33:16] <aximilation> Just make it look pretty
[10:33:28] <jeffreyjames> and how to sign up for a web host
[10:33:57] <aximilation> pity the n00bs
[10:34:49] <nvictor> how do i know if i get an empty jquery object?
[10:35:13] <jnylen> $('...').length == 0
[10:35:50] <nvictor> jnylen: thanks
[10:35:52] <jnylen> np
[10:36:29] <devinrolsen> morning all.
[10:38:05] <airportyh> jnylen: try $('body').css({overflow: 'hidden'})
[10:38:12] <airportyh> that do what you want?
[10:38:32] <jnylen> airportyh: that works.. but it makes all the content shift when it hides the scrollbar
[10:38:58] <jnylen> i can also do position: fixed but that doesn't actually prevent scrolling
[10:39:10] <jnylen> i think i'm going to catch the window scroll event and force it back to the previous scroll position if my dialog is showing
[10:39:27] <rubyruy> anyone know if there's a place to get jquery-ui themeroller icons extracted as separate images?
[10:39:37] <rubyruy> background offsets aren't always practical
[10:39:48] <rubyruy> sometimes you really just need the icon :/
[10:39:50] <jnylen> given (user scrolls to end of dialog content and page starts scrolling) vs. (main scrollbars don't work while dialog is visible) I think the second choice is preferable
[10:41:51] <airportyh> maybe you can capture the scroll event on the dialog and not let it bubble, just a thought
[10:44:23] <daninma> does anyone know of any examples online in regards to using the statuscode: function in jq 1.5+ ajax calls?
[10:45:20] <daninma> it lets you set functions for specific error status codes, but I'm not sure how to code one for unknown, unplanned for status error codes
[10:47:03] <airportyh> the complete handler takes xhr as the first param, from which you can get xhr.status
[10:47:05] <airportyh> I think
[10:48:06] <airportyh> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[10:48:59] <daninma> right but the statuscode functionality requires a statuscode to be provided, so I can use it to do error handling for error codes I'm expecting, but how do you deal with error codes you werent planning for?
[10:50:04] <airportyh> daninma: no, I am saying to use the 'complete' handler
[10:50:10] <daninma> I mean if i was using the error: function etc... I setup if else's for the various status codes that are returned and i can also code and else in there for any I didnt cover, btu the new statuscode: function doesnt seem to have anythgin specific for unplanned codes
[10:50:21] <airportyh> error works too
[10:50:30] <bbrowsergames> I'm trying to set the height of something to the height of another thing with this code: http://pastie.org/private/yuls5qtnz5dexhiw36thq - but whenever I run it, the height of .build_report_container .col1 doesn't seem to change. Is there anything else I have to do?
[10:50:51] <daninma> shoot.. gotta run. Ill be back later
[10:51:47] <airportyh> bbrowsergames: can you post it on jsfiddle?
[10:53:50] <bbrowsergames> airportyh: I'm having some trouble because .build_report_container .col1 ends up getting populated dynamically, and it looks like jsfiddle can't quite handle that
[10:54:36] <airportyh> member:bbrowsergames: should be able to as long as you include the code that populates it
[10:54:49] <bbrowsergames> That code's in there, no dice :(
[10:55:01] <airportyh> hmm, might be an error in the page
[10:55:26] <airportyh> But, the first thing I'd suggest is do an inspect element
[10:55:58] <airportyh> look at it's actual height as it could be affected by css
[10:56:14] <bbrowsergames> okay
[10:56:23] <airportyh> you can still post the fiddle, maybe I can diagnose it
[10:59:58] <gho5t> do it the other way like everyone else

[11:05:29] <SoulRaven> if i don't have the ID of multiple text box elements, how i set the date ussing the datepicker plugin?
[11:05:54] <Segaja> swiggy: should work

[11:08:29] <swiggy> i dont know, it isnt refreshing at all tho
[11:08:56] <aximilation> read that link...
[11:09:49] <SoulRaven> if i don't have the ID of multiple text box elements, how i set the date using the datepicker plugin?
[11:10:10] <aximilation> by name?
[11:10:30] <SilentGuy> I'm trying to convert bookmarks for ebooks. and the target is in jquery form ("*:eq(0) > *:eq(1) > *:eq(1)"). my problem is that the source counted like JS childNodes and counted stuff like "<TextNode textContent="\n ">". Is there a query other then * that would include those for indexing purposes?
[11:10:50] <SoulRaven> aximilation: how i set by name?
[11:11:35] <SoulRaven> i have initiate the datepicker using the same class, on all elements, but is not working, for multiple elements on the same page
[11:11:49] <aximilation> $('[name=foo]') should get that element
[11:12:11] <aximilation> can't you add an id to them?
[11:12:56] <SoulRaven> i hard, because i have clone elements
[11:13:06] <SoulRaven> and i have to modify each element with a diferent id
[11:17:59] <aximilation> newelement=oldelement.clone; newelement.id=oldelement.id+'clone'; or something following that structure?
[11:18:12] <aximilation> I'm sure the syntax is messed up, but you get the idea
[11:18:26] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:18:44] <aximilation> I don't think hallo is here, friend of yours?
[11:18:44] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting some cryptic errors and it's being a bitch to debug
[11:18:59] <ProLoser|Work> missing ) after argument list
[11:18:59] <ProLoser|Work> },
[11:20:41] <SoulRaven> aximilation: i have this code, look, only on the first section, with gpswarranty: http://jsfiddle.net/KSSry/
[11:21:16] <SoulRaven> now i modify only the name attr of the elements
[11:24:19] <dreinull_> i have some divs with ids like id[1], id[2] etc. What is the appropriate selector to get id as an array of all single instances?
[11:26:22] <nvictor> it would be nice if jquery gave more meaningful errors :(
[11:28:26] <drOptimize> dreinull_ $("#myID\\.entry\\[1\\]")
[11:29:07] <nail_> dreinull_: $('[id^="id["]') but [] are not valid characters for IDs
[11:29:12] <dreinull_> drOptimize: I suppose this id notation is not considered canonical by jquery.
[11:29:18] <dreinull_> nail_: :)
[11:29:44] <nail_> (that works though)
[11:29:45] <dreinull_> is there an array like notation that I should use instead
[11:30:32] <nail_> eg id-X or id_X
[11:30:35] <dreinull_> or should I just use id_1, id_2 etc?
[11:30:41] <nail_> yep
[11:30:41] <dreinull_> ok
[11:30:58] <dreinull_> thanks
[11:31:06] <nail_> welcome
[11:33:00] <drOptimize> my example was from http://api.jquery.com/id-selector
[11:33:55] <SilentGuy> is there a selector that includes TextNodes? e.g. one that would return two elements on "A <span>B</span>"?
[11:37:17] <phlp> SilentGuy: there is .contents() http://api.jquery.com/contents
[11:39:42] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to select multiple elements ussing *
[11:39:49] <SoulRaven> something like, Gpswarranties0Startwarranty-*
[11:40:50] <SilentGuy> Ah, hm, I'll try to see if the framework I'm working with will let me use contents() :)
[11:41:10] <kborchers> SoulRaven: check out http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ and look at ^=, *= and $=
[11:41:42] <SoulRaven> thx:)
[11:51:29] <grid_> in what way can i send $('select,input,textarea').val('') to my iframe? it's name is iframe2
[11:53:27] <RTPMatt>  grid_: is the iframe for the same domain?
[11:53:59] <grid_> RTPMatt: the iframe is located in my jquery ui dialog, it is on the same domain, yes
[11:54:19] <djQuery>  grid_ wouldnt it be better to do a reset on the form that the items are in?
[11:54:28] <grid_> i wanted to call the function when i close the dialog, to bring it back to the new state if you reopen it
[11:54:59] <grid_> djQuery: how would i do that?
[11:55:21] <djQuery> well if you have the form you would just do .reset()
[11:55:24] <djQuery> ?reset
[11:55:42] <SilentGuy> damn, it seems I can only give a list of selectors to be applied consecutively, e.g. "*:eq(0) > *:eq(1) > *:eq(1)", and .contents() is a specific function. guess my input is just not compatible to the framework.
[11:55:49] <djQuery> http://www.javascript-coder.com/javascript-form/javascript-reset-form.phtml
[11:56:22] <grid_> djQuery: the iframe has also some # hrefs that will be linked to the bottom, so i wouldnt need scrollTop(0) if i use .reset ?
[11:56:40] <grid_> or probably i will need it? :)
[11:56:42] <Cork[home]> SilentGuy: you could try :first-child instead
[11:56:52] <djQuery> grid_: most likely not
[11:57:16] <Cork[home]> SilentGuy: and nth-child
[11:57:29] <djQuery> grid_: I just dont know how to get a hold of the iframe
[11:57:49] * djQuery momma says iframes are da devil
[11:58:05] <grid_> djQuery: do you want to see my site? i could add your ip to my dev site, so you can probably see what i mean :)
[11:58:19] <eddiemonge> grid_: is an iframe really necessary if its the same domain?
[11:59:24] <SilentGuy> Cork[home]: nth-child() does not seem to count textnodes either...
[11:59:28] <djQuery> var formdiv = $('formdiv').load('urlofiframe', function(){formdiv.dialog();});
[11:59:29] <grid_> eddiemonge: the iframe is already in the background, it will load when the user will open the index.html, if i use .load the user has to wait probably
[11:59:55] <eddiemonge> grid_: huh?
[12:00:14] <grid_> eddiemonge: i combination with jquery ui dialog i mean
[12:00:24] <grid_> it will be opened within that
[12:00:38] <grid_> in combination :)
[12:01:23] <grid_> djQuery: does it fetch/load the iframe content a second time of the server?
[12:01:48] <mintux> this rectangle fade with click http://jsfiddle.net/dXhKh/  how can I fade it with on mouse over on a linke? I have link that I want when mouse cross over that image show (with fade effect) each link has a image when mouse come over it the image replace
[12:01:49] <eddiemonge> grid_: ok but why do you need an iframe? why cant you just directly load the contents into the dialog?
[12:03:01] <grid_> eddiemonge: the iframe is already catched, so thats probably more fast?
[12:03:09] <eddiemonge> ?mouseover @ mintux
[12:03:26] <eddiemonge> grid_: iframes, to me at least, are almost always never the way to go
[12:03:38] <eddiemonge> grid_: how is it cached?
[12:04:14] <grid_> eddiemonge: like this source http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/modal.html it's placed at line 39, so when you open the page, the iframe is already in the background
[12:05:01] <djQuery> grid_: it would hav eto follow the browser caching rules and doing .load would still follow those rules
[12:06:09] <eddiemonge> grid_: again, an iframe isnt necessary for any of what you are describing and is probably making your life harder than it already is
[12:06:30] <djQuery> grid_: and there is no iframe on that page
[12:06:45] <grid_> djQuery: i know it's just example
[12:07:04] <aximilation> can you tell us exactly *why* you need an iframe?
[12:07:26] <aximilation> If you can't give a good reason, you probably don't need it and are just doing more work than you need to
[12:07:46] <aximilation> eg: iframes to provide content from an external site within yours, is an example where it can be appropriate
[12:07:57] <eddiemonge> grid_: im not trying to critiscize, just trying to make your life easier with past experiences from my own
[12:08:19] <grid_> yeah, my friend is programmer, he hates iframes also
[12:09:19] <aximilation> It's not about hating them (yes they cause bad code practices) but again, I ask, *why* do you want to use them?
[12:09:41] <swiggy> $('form[id="captcha2"],input').attr('disabled',true);            will that disable all the <input> fields for <form id="captcha2"> ??
[12:09:43] <aximilation> Do you want a container? That's what a div is for
[12:09:56] <swiggy> i only want the inputs on form id="captcha2" disabled
[12:10:13] <aximilation> swiggy: you may want to drop that comma
[12:10:25] <swiggy> what is the selector i need to use
[12:10:31] <swiggy> im having a brain fart
[12:10:41] <aximilation> $('#captcha2 input') probably
[12:11:00] <eddiemonge> swiggy: $('#captcha2').find(':input').prop('disabled', true) i think
[12:11:13] <swiggy> ty
[12:11:26] <Datarecal> any thoughts on how to submit the form normally after the submit handler is called http://jsbin.com/adakup/edit
[12:11:56] <swiggy> nope
[12:11:59] <swiggy> neither worked
[12:12:09] <eddiemonge> swiggy: jsfiddle it
[12:12:13] <swiggy> isnt it
[12:12:17] <swiggy> ,find(input)
[12:12:20] <swiggy> not :input
[12:12:21] <eddiemonge> Datarecal: what do you mean submit it normally?
[12:12:26] <eddiemonge> ?:input
[12:12:39] <curlytoe> I found a jQuery plugin a while back and can't remember what it was called.  It had the ability to delay processing of events on an element and had options that would only fire a specific event one time if more than one of the same event occurred within a specific timeframe.
[12:12:41] <eddiemonge> oops bott is dead again
[12:12:51] <Datarecal> well the form is a getresponse form so its offsite and cant be submitted via ajax, so i need it to regular submit like a normal html form after
[12:12:54] <aximilation> swiggy: $('#captcha2 input').attr('disabled',true); will work, I just tested it
[12:12:57] <Datarecal> but .validate seems to hook into .submit
[12:13:13] <eddiemonge> Datarecal: yeah, if it doesnt validate it doesnt submit
[12:13:14] <grid_> aximilation: in this cast i want to use them because the browser doesnt need to load something of the server when i open the jquery ui dialog, it's already somewhere in the background
[12:13:16] <swiggy> $('#captcha2').find('input').attr('disabled', true)
[12:13:18] <swiggy> also works
[12:13:28] <Datarecal> it validates
[12:13:44] <Datarecal> but since i have a submit handler it wont submit to getresponse.com normally i need to figure out a way to do both
[12:13:48] <grid_> aximilation: i think .load will reload the content on every click
[12:13:50] <eddiemonge> grid_: .load will do that
[12:14:03] <aximilation> swiggy: one is shorter, one is longer, they do the same thing in the end
[12:14:14] <eddiemonge> grid_: .load() it into a hidden div and then the dialog will open that div without reloading
[12:14:16] <Datarecal> so my ajax submit will work and then tell the browser to submit the form as it normally would to getresponse.com
[12:15:10] <aximilation> grid_: <div style="display:none;">hidden contents</div> <- can't this do what you need?
[12:15:22] <grid_> eddiemonge: that is a good way, yes, but it's going about the way to reset it, would that be more easy then? it must just going to it's old state
[12:15:24] <aximilation> You're not really explaining your use case well
[12:15:54] <grid_> aximilation: i know that :)
[12:16:11] <eddiemonge> Datarecal: you dont want the cool ajax style submit?
[12:16:20] <SoulRaven> strange things with datepicker
[12:16:28] <Datarecal> eddiemonge ajax cant submit to other domains as far as i know
[12:16:38] <eddiemonge> grid_: i am so confused to what you are doing
[12:17:06] <grid_> eddiemonge: do you want me to show my website?
[12:17:32] <eddiemonge> Datarecal: doing $(form).submit() without any preventDefaults and return falses int he forms submit handler will submit it normally
[12:17:48] <SoulRaven> i have some elements cloned, each element, even if is cloned has a diferent id, way when i click on some clone element, the datepicker appears on the original element, and the date is change on that element, not in the clone element, wher i clicked in fact
[12:17:59] <eddiemonge> grid_: not really. if you cant explain what it is in one or two sentences you are probably trying to solve the wrong problem
[12:18:03] <eddiemonge> or something like that
[12:18:26] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: how are you calling it and how are you cloning them?
[12:18:42] <aximilation> +1 eddiemonge
[12:19:11] <aximilation> grid_: have you solved the "why" of your issue first?
[12:19:39] <SoulRaven> eddiemonge: var row = tbody.children().last().clone(true);
[12:19:43] <aximilation> I get the impression that you are trying to figure out the "how" to something that does not have a well defined "why"
[12:20:49] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: and how are you calling the datepicker?
[12:21:24] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/KSSry/2/
[12:22:23] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: either you need to recall datepicker on the newly cloned items or try clone(true, true)
[12:23:02] <grid_> aximilation: since my iframes didnt cause me any trouble (since today) i didnt realize why i would need .load, i think about it to use it right now
[12:23:30] <SoulRaven> is not working with clone(true, true)
[12:23:34] <grid_> i even think about to forget the whole reset thing :)
[12:24:33] <John3^AFK> How can I make so that the counter updates automaticaly when I edit the textarea? If I delete some letters with right-click and cut it doesent update. I also wonder how I could do so that the counter also reacts on both keypress and keyup? http://jsfiddle.net/kPRg5/

[12:25:24] <eddiemonge> sorry, ignore that
[12:25:50] <drOptimize> John3 what about onChange?
[12:27:20] <drOptimize> or possibly making a function and attaching it to multiple events
[12:28:07] <Datarecal> http://jsfiddle.net/s32ND/3/ is the latest jsfiddle the notes are in the css
[12:29:16] <eddiemonge> John3^AFK: something like this but i have to see if there is a right click event: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/kPRg5/1/

[12:30:22] <John3^AFK> eddimonge: I updated it with keypress also
[12:30:24] <John3^AFK> that worked
[12:30:31] <John3^AFK> But how about the right click thingy
[12:30:32] <John3^AFK> hmm

[12:34:01] <Datarecal> eddiemonge i know but i need the submit handler so i can grab the data as well and set sessions
[12:34:19] <shpizank> looks like something similar to `term = $form.find( 'input[name="s"]' ).val()` ?
[12:35:39] <eddiemonge> shpizank: ugh sure  $.post(url, {s:term}, function (data) {});
[12:35:46] <SoulRaven> eddiemonge: is not working eather with call datepicker after each clone
[12:36:05] <shpizank> wasn't sure if that would also work with array variables being passed

[12:52:18] <thefalling> is there a version of bind that can somehow only bind to the last element added?
[12:52:55] <eddiemonge> thefalling: yeah, just call bind when you add that element
[12:54:10] <thefalling> I have a magicbox (modal popup box) and i can delete a file with it, and has a confirm dialog,  i use .live() on the load, but if I open and close the popup, itll show the dailog twice, if i open close it 3 times itll show the confirm 3 times

[13:01:46] <ckb> why am I getting: "Uncaught TypeError: Object 0 has no method 'width'" when the DOM element clearly exists?
[13:02:17] <eddiemonge> thefalling: and your markup? use jsfiddle
[13:02:19] <ravenzz> ?paste @ ckb
[13:02:45] <ckb> one sec
[13:03:13] <phlp> ckb: .width instead of .width() ?
[13:03:43] <ckb> http://pastie.org/private/qr86p8c0ze3hyyar5q6a
[13:03:45] <ckb> hell no
[13:03:51] <ckb> "has no method width"
[13:03:56] <ckb> not "has no property"
[13:04:12] <ckb> line 11, is what it's spitting up on
[13:04:35] <ravenzz> js fiddle?
[13:04:51] <ckb> what?
[13:04:52] <phlp> well i meant if its the DOM element then you would need to use .width and not .width()
[13:05:10] <ckb> oh, it's a selector in a jquery object, phlp
[13:06:18] <sadmicrowave> ckb, does the error tell you which line the error is on?
[13:06:31] <eddiemonge> ckb: you should do the height and width and offset before show on line 1
[13:06:34] <ckb>  ckb> line 11, is what it's spitting up on
[13:07:33] <eddiemonge> whats the error message though
[13:07:37] <sadmicrowave> ckb, where are top, left, width, and height variables defined before .show()?
[13:08:00] <sadmicrowave> .seen bot-t
[13:08:01] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 14 hours, 15 minutes and 22 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Quit: bot-t
[13:08:20] <kborchers> bot-t is such a quitter
[13:08:39] <sadmicrowave> sometimes I want to quit...life
[13:09:26] <ckb> ahhh
[13:10:03] <John3^AFK> eddiemonge: big thanks!
[13:10:16] <eddiemonge> John3^AFK: support is questionable for that though
[13:10:26] <sadmicrowave> ckb, ?? the variables: top, left, width, and height in your first animate brackets {} are nonexistent?
[13:11:21] <sadmicrowave> ckb, fyi...height: height, is invalid (the comma needs to be removed after the last option
[13:11:23] <sadmicrowave> )
[13:11:28] <neuSynergy> http://jsfiddle.net/JwAMp/19/ - anyone have an idea why when a link is clicked, the slider is duplicated?
[13:11:29] <John3^AFK> I also wonder how can I make so that one of my divs shows a random message everytime the sites gets refreshed? I want to add 5 sentences thats shows randomnized at page refresh
[13:11:50] <eddiemonge> John3^AFK: that should be done via your backend
[13:12:10] <John3^AFK> I dont have a backend. I just want to make this simple thing. Should I use PHP for that?
[13:12:22] <John3^AFK> Its nothing to do with java?
[13:12:26] <John3^AFK> jquery/js i mean
[13:12:57] <eddiemonge> John3^AFK: lol java is defintely not javascript or jquery. you could use javscript for that but a backend would be better
[13:13:03] <sadmicrowave> ckb, that goes for your second .animate() function with "width: width," and your .css() function with "left: offsetLeeft,"
[13:13:15] <John3^AFK> eddiemonge: Thats why I corrected it with jquery/js =)
[13:13:27] <John3^AFK> Ok thanks for the help!
[13:17:45] <DevBrPb> anybody know how i find row in xml with jquery?
[13:18:14] <DevBrPb> i want display a only row of my xml file
[13:18:16] <DevBrPb> ...
[13:22:06] <erichynds> DevBrPb: $(xml).find("row")
[13:22:21] <erichynds> replace xml with your xml document (not xml string), and row with the name of the node
[13:25:44] <surfdue> if im clicking submit on a form and the input above it is .inputEmail how would i select its value? $(this).closest('.inputEmail').val(); is not working
[13:27:02] <kborchers> surfdue: why not just $('.inputEmail').val();
[13:27:22] <sadmicrowave> kborchers++
[13:28:09] <kborchers> surfdue: if there is more than one .inputEmail, then we will need to see your HTML to create a better selector
[13:28:12] <surfdue> kborchers, its a class cause there is more then one
[13:28:24] <jaypitidi> How can I get a preloading gif to show while my pages are loading? http://pastebin.com/mVeqWPUZ
[13:28:26] <sadmicrowave> surfdue, so add an ID to it
[13:28:38] <kborchers> sadmicrowave++
[13:28:46] <surfdue> kborchers, http://pastebin.com/tNvrKADh
[13:29:01] <kborchers> ?prev @ surfdue
[13:29:05] <kborchers> damnit bot-t
[13:29:15] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[13:29:16] <surfdue> kborchers, i tried prev()
[13:29:19] <sadmicrowave> jaypitidi, at the top of your js initiate the gif, then at the bottom hide it
[13:30:08] <phlp> surfdue: $(this).find('.inputEmail')
[13:30:17] <kborchers> surfdue: ok, then we need to see your js now to figure out the context in which your executing this selector
[13:30:30] <sadmicrowave> phlp, where 'this' is his submit button?
[13:30:35] <sadmicrowave> I don't think that will work
[13:30:51] <phlp> im assuming he is handling .submit() so this is the form
[13:31:04] <surfdue> kborchers, http://pastebin.com/rLY9WTth
[13:31:18] <surfdue> phlp, i believe find will find all of them
[13:31:23] <sadmicrowave> phlp, I was assuming he was using .click() .... assuming is all we can since he didn't post any code
[13:31:47] <sadmicrowave> surfdue, add an ID to the input element
[13:31:50] <kborchers> surfdue: just add id's
[13:31:52] <phlp> surfdue: only within this which is the form being submitted
[13:32:02] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, beat you too it
[13:32:04] <sadmicrowave> to*
[13:32:04] <kborchers> heh
[13:32:11] <flaming_bass> muh
[13:32:13] <flaming_bass> mah
[13:32:14] <surfdue> no thats messy
[13:32:16] <flaming_bass> leh
[13:32:22] <kborchers> how is that messy?????
[13:32:22] <flaming_bass> feh
[13:32:29] <surfdue> putting ids all over.
[13:32:32] <sadmicrowave> surfdue, yes you are right id's are always the messiest way to go
[13:32:42] * sadmicrowave is being sarcastic
[13:33:26] <sadmicrowave> surfdue, can you post your html showing the form and the input you wish to capture?
[13:33:35] <kborchers> he did
[13:33:45] <sadmicrowave> html?
[13:33:52] <phlp> http://pastebin.com/tNvrKADh
[13:34:03] <sadmicrowave> oh sorry
[13:34:25] <GoGoGarrett> I have 3 divs,  and a button being pushed down with padding.  I want all 3 of these buttons to stay alined when the window is resized.  This is what I have. http://jsfiddle.net/tmYvL/  any ideas why i'm not having any luck?
[13:34:27] <datlap> I m using jQuery UI tabs and it works fine. However I am having problems w/ subtabs. I m putting the same javascript code I wrote for the parent html to the child html. However it is not executed. Any idea?
[13:35:04] <sadmicrowave> surfdue, .closest() won't work because that function goes up through the DOM hierarchy, not down
[13:35:09] <kborchers> surfdue: if you refuse to use the best solution which is to use id's, you could try $(this).find("input[type='submit']").prev() but that is a ton of overhead just to find a single element
[13:35:23] <B|ackPanther> how do i pass multiple parameters to jquery fancybox using ajax ?
[13:36:39] <phlp> how is that better than $(this).find('.inputEmail')
[13:36:43] <sadmicrowave> surfdue, so .closest() basically starts at <form> and goes up through your html looking .inputEmail (which it won't find) because it needs to find it within itself
[13:36:52] <B|ackPanther> One the example provided they only send one parameter to the server.
[13:36:59] <sadmicrowave> phlp++ surfdue .find() is what you need for this
[13:37:40] <kborchers> it's not but when he said there was more than one, thought maybe we weren't seeing "all" of the html there.
[13:38:12] <sadmicrowave> I expect we are seeing all the HTML within that form...there are probably other forms on the page with .inputEmail in them...
[13:38:17] <sadmicrowave> but $(this) takes care of that
[13:39:51] <crankharder> I've got toggleSlide('fast') on a click event, and there's no slide effect, just show/hiding.  Live page (click 'leaderboard'): http://68.100.5.21:9999/series/11/events  - javascript is line #35 here: http://68.100.5.21:9999/javascripts/series.js
[13:40:12] <datlap> how do I create a subtabs using jquery ui tabs?
[13:40:56] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/tmYvL/1/  I'm trying to keep these buttons aligned as the window is resized, as well as keep the padding.  any ideas?
[13:41:05] <crankharder> so, why isn't it sliding?
[13:41:14] <kborchers> datlap: what do you mean by subtabs?
[13:41:57] <datlap> i have 4 pages using tabs, 1 2 3,4. I m creating 3 more pages if user clicks on 1 (1a,1b,1c)
[13:42:10] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, is all that css really necessary for your fiddle?
[13:42:17] <datlap> it works w/ 1,2,3,4 but not 1a 1b 1c.
[13:42:57] <kborchers> can you give us a link to your site or create a simplified test case at http://jsfiddle.net ?
[13:44:05] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, and I'm not aware that you can use a pixel integer as the value for the css 'background' property
[13:44:33] <datlap> kborchers:http://dpaste.com/585781/
[13:44:35] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, are you looking for 'height', maxHeight
[13:45:03] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to set all the div's to the same height, and theres a padding-bottom to each of those div's of like 50 or so to push the buttons down
[13:45:18] <GoGoGarrett> i'm trying to get the tallest div, and set them all to that height - so they stay aligned
[13:45:26] <GoGoGarrett> You can see the real site at http://etbeancounter.heroku.com/
[13:45:27] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, if you want all the divs to be the same height why not do it with pure css?
[13:45:47] <GoGoGarrett> It's a fluid layout and hard pixel numbers don't work well
[13:46:08] <datlap> kborchers: try this one http://dpaste.com/585784/
[13:50:24] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/tmYvL/2/  this is what I have, and I'm just setting the pure "height" to the maxHeight value.  and took away the css and added resources
[13:52:17] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, that won't work...if the 2nd maxHeight is less than the 3rd maxHeight then your divs will be unequal
[13:52:29] <sadmicrowave> you had the right idea in the first fiddle...the css was throwing it off though
[13:53:51] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, notice your .each() function isn't even being entered into http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/tmYvL/3/
[13:54:18] <sadmicrowave> i take that back
[13:55:24] <Matt-> does .submit() work on button elements? I have a form with multiple submit buttons and need to trigger a submit but only for a certian button
[13:55:36] <phlp> that completely killed my firefox
[13:55:36] <GoGoGarrett> Should I maybe do innerHeight? idk how that'd make a difference though
[13:57:05] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/tmYvL/5/
[13:57:33] <datlap> hi all i need to create 4 subtabs underneath tab main. any idea? http://dpaste.com/585788/
[13:57:38] <GoGoGarrett> That's the same as what I have
[13:57:46] <GoGoGarrett> if you resize it, they are all the same height, but the padding doesn't stay, and the words get lost
[13:58:21] <sadmicrowave> GoGoGarrett, O.o.O I see what you're going for now
[13:58:30] <GoGoGarrett> haha yeah it sucks
[13:58:32] <neuSynergy> ok, can someone explain to me why chrome does a little "catch up" thing with jquery timeouts?
[13:58:45] <neuSynergy> like, it speed the timeout up 10 fold trying to catch u where it should be
[14:01:10] <ajpiano> what is a jquery timeout
[14:01:36] <neuSynergy> sorry, javascript timeout
[14:01:51] <neuSynergy> smarta$$ lol
[14:02:24] <ajpiano> are you triggering animations in a setTimeout loop?
[14:02:37] <neuSynergy> yea
[14:03:01] <neuSynergy> I'm assuming you're familiar with this?
[14:03:05] <ajpiano> yes, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5766263/run-settimeout-only-when-tab-is-active
[14:03:22] <ajpiano> it's related to the fact that we support requestAnimationFrame in browsers where it's available
[14:03:42] <gnarf> or, better yet, don't use setTimeout to queue animations :)
[14:03:44] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381
[14:04:04] <kborchers> ajpiano: i already gave that link to 2 people today ... it's setTimeout day
[14:04:08] <neuSynergy> odd, I have a blur focus code but let me give that a whirl
[14:04:23] <gnarf> use an animation callback which queues the next one after a timeout
[14:04:35] <ajpiano> kborchers: hahah yeah i literally just did ctrl-f on the logs cause i saw you do it earlier :p
[14:04:37] <gnarf> instead of a timeout that queues one, and then calls itself regardless of the completion of the previous one
[14:04:51] <kborchers> heh
[14:05:08] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/tmYvL/6/  I got this, and the padding is staying there, but now I'm loosing the functionality of all the div's staying the same height
[14:05:25] <kenperkins> anyone heard of a bug on line 6584 of returning a value like so: "100%" (inside getWH)
[14:05:37] <kenperkins> where the value is returned as a percent, but then treated as a number immediatley thereafter
[14:05:55] <kenperkins> jquery 1.6.2
[14:05:57] <ajpiano> kenperkins: yes let me find the ticket
[14:06:34] <acidjazz> if i ahve a click event on a <tr>
[14:06:38] <acidjazz> and i click inside that tr on a checkbox
[14:06:52] <ajpiano> kenperkins http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9945 perhaps?
[14:06:59] <acidjazz> how can i check if that checkbox was clicked inside the $('tr').click(function() { /* in here */ }); ??
[14:07:37] <kanzie> is there any nice way for me to pass obj to my callback. http://pastebin.com/RSjbCEa4 I can't really think of anything but it feels like it should be possible
[14:07:55] <kenperkins> bingo
[14:07:57] <kenperkins> that's exactly it
[14:08:02] <ajpiano> acidjazz function(e) {  if ( $(e.target).is("input:checkbox"}) {}   }
[14:08:02] <neuSynergy> hmmm. still bugging out
[14:08:24] <acidjazz> can i get $(e.target).attr('type') and itll be checkbox?
[14:08:46] <ajpiano> you can do anything along those lines
[14:09:06] <acidjazz> ajpiano: e isnt defined
[14:09:11] <acidjazz> ah
[14:09:12] <acidjazz> (e)
[14:09:14] <ajpiano> you ahve to pass it into the callba....
[14:09:25] <acidjazz> NO I KNEW OK
[14:09:28] <acidjazz> :)
[14:09:54] <ajpiano> kanzie: success: function(data) { callback(data, obj);   }
[14:09:56] <acidjazz> is using .is more efficient thatn $(e.target).attr('type') == 'input' ?
[14:10:24] <ajpiano> acidjazz: anything that does $(e.target) is actually a waste
[14:10:35] <acidjazz> ajpiano: well what should i be doing then?
[14:10:41] <ajpiano> fastest is to do e.target.tagName or something like that
[14:10:50] <acidjazz> what is tagName
[14:10:56] <acidjazz> name="" ?
[14:10:59] <ajpiano> think about it for one second
[14:11:01] <kanzie> ajpiano: nah, that would assume I have a function called callback which I don't. callback is a param that contains a name of the method to run. So I need something like window[callback](data, obj)
[14:11:17] <ajpiano> oh
[14:11:23] <ajpiano> yeah, you do need that
[14:11:28] <ajpiano> but wait
[14:11:33] <ajpiano> if callback is a string
[14:11:36] <ajpiano> then it would fail right now
[14:11:39] <acidjazz> tagName is the name of the tag .. if its an input.
[14:12:05] <kanzie> ajpiano: sorry, not a string, a function
[14:12:16] <ajpiano> kanzie... if it's a function, you can just execute it right there
[14:12:30] <ajpiano> you don't have to like, execute a function by its own name
[14:13:53] <GoGoGarrett> is there no way to set something to somethings innerheight?
[14:13:59] <kanzie> ajpiano: I haven't been able to run the code yet, just writing it but Im using the function I pastebin'd like setValue({bla: 'bla'},myFunctionName);
[14:14:20] <GoGoGarrett> I stored the innerHeight of the div in a variable, and I'm trying to pass it through height, but it doesn't seem to retain the padding and junk
[14:14:31] <ajpiano> kanzie... right...
[14:14:45] <ajpiano> you can then execute that as callback();
[14:15:07] <kanzie> problem I saw is that if I do success: callback(data, obj) it would not check local scope first but global scope
[14:15:19] <ajpiano> what are you talking about
[14:15:22] <gnarf> hrm
[14:15:28] <ajpiano> not success: callback()
[14:15:33] <ajpiano> success: function() { callback();  }
[14:15:40] <kanzie> wellâ¦ I can't use () in the success-hanlder
[14:15:42] <gnarf> so - if you were trying to determine if a div is positioned using top/left or bottom/right
[14:15:50] <ajpiano> otherwise you're executing the funtction too early
[14:15:53] <gnarf> so - if you were trying to determine if a div is positioned using top/left or bottom/right - how would you handle it?
[14:16:23] <kanzie> ajpiano: so if callback() is not a function but callback a variable with a function in it it will launch?
[14:16:29] <ajpiano> yes
[14:16:42] <ajpiano> kanzie how do you think passing a function as an optoin to ajax works
[14:16:52] <jp-> jquery ui's draggable event's, what is the ui object that is passed to the event handler? or even better, where can i find documentation that explains it because the jqueryui.com draggable docs don't mention anything other than it's passed to the even handler.
[14:16:56] <ajpiano> it doesn't magically know the name of the funtion and look it up
[14:17:07] <phlp> GoGoGarrett: http://jsfiddle.net/tmYvL/8
[14:17:13] <ajpiano> jp- http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable
[14:17:16] <kanzie> ajpiano: that discussion on next to last episode of yeyQuery was really good wakeup-call for meâ¦still getting my head around it though.
[14:17:16] <jp-> droppable's ui obj is the actual object that was dragged and dropped, however that doesn't seem to be the case with the draggable events
[14:17:40] <ajpiano> kanzie: which discussion :p
[14:18:09] <kanzie> it was just a short mention of how you guys are still flabbergasted that people don't understand $ is just a function-name etc.
[14:18:18] <ajpiano> heh yeah ... i see what you're saying
[14:18:19] <kanzie> and that functions can contain functions
[14:18:21] <GoGoGarrett> sweet, thanks a lot phlp I wouldn't of thought of that haha
[14:18:24] <phlp> GoGoGarrett: the problem is you're setting the height then expecting it to grow based on what's inside it but that wont happen, the height next time will be exactly what you set it to. so use whats inside it to determine how tall it should be
[14:18:30] <ajpiano> well i am glad then that it got ya going
[14:18:44] <GoGoGarrett> gotcha, because that's whats expanding
[14:19:36] <GoGoGarrett> works on the fiddle, but not when i run it in the console of my site ^>^ dang, i'll mess with it
[14:19:38] <neuSynergy> http://jsfiddle.net/JwAMp/24/
[14:20:29] <neuSynergy> blur doesnt cause it to stop, and clicking a link duplicates the timeout (looks like clearTimeout isnt working?)
[14:21:10] <ajpiano> ohhh neuSynergy this is not the problem we thought it was
[14:21:21] <gnarf> paritally is ajpiano
[14:21:27] <ajpiano> well, sort of
[14:21:34] <ajpiano> it also seems like he isn't really debouncing properly
[14:21:47] <ajpiano> gnarf you wanna take dis :pp
[14:21:56] <gnarf> it seems to me that your organization of the entire thing is in question neuSynergy
[14:22:14] <neuSynergy> debouncing? lol
[14:22:34] <neuSynergy> gnarf: yea, I know it needs a lot of cleanup
[14:22:44] <neuSynergy> but I also have a lot to learn
[14:22:55] <gnarf> well
[14:23:06] <gnarf> then lets work on that
[14:23:22] <gnarf> first suggestion: write a "makeActive( rel )"
[14:23:48] <neuSynergy> a function?
[14:23:51] <gnarf> yeah
[14:23:54] <neuSynergy> alright
[14:24:03] <GoGoGarrett> Can you specific javascript to only load on a specific stylesheet? and disable it for mobile?
[14:24:18] <neuSynergy> give me a bit to rewrite it into a proper function
[14:25:10] <gnarf> that should handle your finding the currently active one.  Animate it to fadeOut.  the callback from the fadeout should start the fadein, and the callback from the fadein should set a timeout for the slide()
[14:25:28] <gnarf> slide just takes the active and finds the next, then pushes the hard work to makeActive
[14:25:52] <neuSynergy> gotcha
[14:26:02] <neuSynergy> lemme write that down
[14:26:10] <gnarf> you might want to clearTimeout in the makeActive
[14:26:27] <gnarf> and setTimeout in the callbacks
[14:26:42] <gnarf> your hover can still do clearTimeout / setTimeout
[14:26:53] <gnarf> it should all layout and make more sense
[14:27:05] <gnarf> i jsut wrote one of these recently
[14:27:07] * gnarf digs
[14:28:12] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/d5053f27311fadccf753
[14:28:16] <gnarf> thats what mine ended up
[14:28:22] <gnarf> but it didn't have manual link clicking
[14:28:29] <gnarf> so its a little less complex than what you need
[14:28:34] <mfilipe> hi! how do I configure localization in jquery-validate?
[14:28:47] <gnarf> but it might be a good start
[14:29:12] <neuSynergy> interesting yea
[14:29:29] <neuSynergy> oh, one thing thats bugging me
[14:29:51] <neuSynergy> whats the difference between doing a "var item = blah" and "item = blah"
[14:30:06] <gnarf> hey - can anyone think of a way to detect if an item was positioned using top vs bottom, left vs right?
[14:30:21] <neuSynergy> gnarf: relative to what?
[14:30:34] <gnarf> neuSynergy: var is scoped to the function that contains it
[14:30:43] <neuSynergy> ah!
[14:30:53] <gnarf> neuSynergy: without a var, its global which is bad
[14:30:53] <neuSynergy> so it makes it a local variable
[14:31:00] <neuSynergy> gotcha gotcha
[14:31:02] <neuSynergy> sweet thx
[14:31:38] <gnarf> neuSynergy: note that all of the vars inside that closure on line 6-35 are accessible in the inner functions too
[14:31:43] <neuSynergy> but if everything is in a function, and var is defined in a top lvl function, its still local but globally available to sub functions corrent?
[14:31:50] <neuSynergy> exactly
[14:31:51] <neuSynergy> right
[14:31:54] <neuSynergy> makes sense now
[14:32:10] <neuSynergy> and here I was trying to try "global item" lol
[14:32:11] <gnarf> function level scoping
[14:32:19] <neuSynergy> yea, im familiar with that
[14:32:26] <neuSynergy> just didnt know jquery's version of it
[14:32:33] <neuSynergy> anyway, what were u saying about positioning?
[14:34:15] <ckb> okay fellas.. I have a question. I'm using AJAX to create a gallery viewer. in my $.get callback, I set the element's html, and call another callback (which uses the elements height). Is that element guarenteed to have the exact height before my 2nd function call?
[14:36:40] <gnarf> neuSynergy: unrelated, i'm trying to solve an issue in jQuery :)
[14:36:44] <gnarf> well, UI
[14:36:45] <gnarf> but yeah
[14:38:23] <neuSynergy> gnarf: I might be able to help
[14:38:35] <neuSynergy> gnarf: whats the issue
[14:39:01] <gnarf> i need to detect if an element has been positioned using top/bottom or left/right
[14:39:08] <gnarf> its pretty much that simple
[14:39:09] <gnarf> :)
[14:39:59] <neuSynergy> relative to its parent?
[14:40:35] <gnarf> position property is unessecary
[14:40:53] <gnarf> thats easy enough to know
[14:41:15] <neuSynergy> Im confused as to what you're trying to accomplish
[14:41:16] <ohiosilver> Hi guys
[14:41:24] <ckb> okay,,
[14:41:32] <neuSynergy> what you're saying is rather vague
[14:41:40] <gnarf> neuSynergy: its actually quite specific
[14:41:45] <gnarf> given ANY element
[14:41:57] <gnarf> i want to know if bottom/right are not auto
[14:42:03] <neuSynergy> oh
[14:42:06] <gnarf> otherwise assume top/left
[14:42:11] <ohiosilver> Could anyone help me out figure why the animation here http://bit.ly/oLg2FA is acting so weird? Choose any filter from the left menu
[14:42:19] <gnarf> but i can't seem to get it cross browser
[14:42:36] <neuSynergy> I.E. giving you trouble eh'?
[14:42:39] <neuSynergy> lol
[14:44:16] <neuSynergy> tried a var bottom = $(this).css('bottom'); if (bottom != ('auto' || '100%')); ?
[14:44:20] <CodeZombie> is it possible to convert a string inside a variable to a jquery object?
[14:44:33] <gnarf> neuSynergy: actually its firefox that disagrees
[14:44:42] <gnarf> ie seems to be handling it
[14:44:46] <CodeZombie> $("mystring") works, but var mystring = "mystring"; $(mystring) doesn't.
[14:44:48] <neuSynergy> wierd
[14:44:52] <gnarf> and yeah, i was checking that bottom wasn't auto
[14:44:58] <gnarf> but in FF its a px value
[14:45:05] <gnarf> even when not set via css
[14:45:20] <neuSynergy> then just check it to the parent/window
[14:46:12] <neuSynergy> one second
[14:47:11] <neuSynergy> var maxheight = $(window).height; if ($(this).height + $(this).offset[1] == maxheight ) {} ...
[14:47:36] <ajpiano> that's not at all what he's trying to figure out :)
[14:47:37] <neuSynergy> erm forgot a pair of brackets but you get the idea
[14:48:18] <ckb> ajpiano: will .html() update the elements height instantly? or is there some delay?
[14:48:22] <neuSynergy> what all is he trying to figure out then?
[14:48:37] <ajpiano> CodeZombie, if the strings are identical it should work fine
[14:48:38] <ckb> I'm getting unreliable results with .html(html).height()
[14:48:59] <neuSynergy> sounds like you're working with modal boxes gnarf
[14:49:05] <ajpiano> neuSynergy: whether an element is positioned using top or bottom, left or right
[14:49:15] <ajpiano> neuSynergy: he's trying to fix generic code for the jQuery UI slide effect
[14:49:18] <CodeZombie> ajpiano that was just an example... I'm grabbing the selected text in a div... that text is then stored in a variable, and then I'd like to convert it into a jquery object.
[14:49:21] <ajpiano> for anyone who slides anything
[14:49:22] <gnarf> *scale
[14:49:37] <neuSynergy> gotcha
[14:49:43] <gnarf> (i typoed on -dev - sry to put the wrong word in your head ajpiano)
[14:49:53] <ajpiano> np
[14:50:00] <ckb> sigh
[14:50:12] <ajpiano> CodeZombie you probably are forgetting to append a . or # other thing that will actually make the string into a useful selector
[14:50:24] <ajpiano> ckb: it should work, but sometimes the browser might not repaint instantaneously
[14:50:36] <ajpiano> if you throw the height check into a setTimeout(fn, 0) is it any more reliable
[14:51:22] <CodeZombie> ajpiano: ya know, you actually just answered my question... It's been a long day, and I'm trying to shove a random string where a selector should go
[14:51:26] <ohiosilver> anyone?
[14:51:26] <CodeZombie> thanks
[14:52:04] <ckb> ajpiano: seems to work fine with the timeout.
[14:52:07] <ckb> chrome has issues.
[14:52:31] <neuSynergy> gnarf: can I see what you have so far
[14:53:48] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.scale.js#L121-122
[14:55:31] <neuSynergy> hmmm
[14:56:33] <gnarf> fails in firefox
[14:56:40] <jtannenbaum> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'catcomplete' <-- isn't it supposed to be built in?
[14:56:40] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/effects/effects.html
[14:56:43] <neuSynergy> just those 2 lines huh?
[15:00:21] <duttons> hi all.. I am trying to get a plugin working on my website and I am struggling to get it to work .. partly beacuse I am trying to make it work in another way...  Please could someone tell me how I would surround a image src with a Href using jquery? or give some advice on how to implement the plugin..  I would appreciate it if someone could have a look at my URL and make a suggestion..Thanks in advance :)
[15:01:02] <ckb> duttons, http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[15:02:00] <ckb> $(".myimg").wrap($('<a href="myurl" />'));
[15:03:07] <Carraway> if i'm trying to get the tag that a given item is inside of, is there a better way to grab it than current.attr("tagName")? tagName seems to work in 1.3.2 but not in the most recent 1.6.2
[15:03:34] <ajpiano> in 1.6.2 you would do .prop("tagName")
[15:03:38] <ajpiano> or just... current[0].tagName
[15:03:44] <Carraway> ooo
[15:03:53] <ckb> 1.3.2?
[15:04:04] <Carraway> is the attr -> prop change a recent thing
[15:04:23] <ajpiano> yes, 1.6
[15:04:25] <ckb> I like to roll around without power steering, automatic windows, and A/C in my brand new Ferrari too!
[15:04:35] <Carraway> that worked magically
[15:04:47] <Carraway> thanks ajpiano
[15:04:52] <ckb> attr still works, but for attributes. :P
[15:05:02] <ckb> afaik
[15:05:32] <Carraway> ha, yeah that makes sense
[15:06:23] <jtannenbaum> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ okay I'm going crazy here
[15:06:43] <jtannenbaum> where is the download link to this plugin. It is nowhere to be found on this page, even though it's the ~demo page~
[15:07:08] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/download
[15:07:23] <jtannenbaum> oh it's a separate bloody..
[15:07:31] <iateadonut> when i'm doing a post, what should the php file look like to return something?
[15:08:02] <iateadonut> in the past, i've used javascript ajax, and echo "$whatever"; was enough to return a string.
[15:08:23] <iateadonut> now, that technique is sending me "[object Object]"
[15:08:27] <duttons> <ckb>: thanks , will give that a go..
[15:09:00] <duttons> <ckb> not sure how I am going to get it to work though
[15:09:18] <iateadonut> nevermind.  works now.
[15:14:16] <Diogo> hi, i have o problem using animate with my site. when i cliked on BRODCAST LINEUP the scrolls appear on my browser..http://d500.hopto.org/radio/
[15:14:51] <Diogo> i know that the problem is in <div id="footerContainer">
[15:15:35] <duttons> <ckb> dont think it worked..  could you have a look at a line of my code and see if I have done it properly?  I need it to on hover add a class and surround the image src with a href to kick off the plugin
[15:17:13] <jtannenbaum> when I have autocomplete imported from jquery-ui (with the core, widget, positioning, etc) it's still saying catcomplete is not a property of object
[15:17:54] <ajpiano> are you sure you included the files properly
[15:17:55] <jtannenbaum> ah wait
[15:17:58] <jtannenbaum> yea
[15:18:04] <duttons> <ckb> I am trying to add this http://professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm to this http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[15:18:07] <jtannenbaum> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/categories.html they make their own catcomplete method for the demo
[15:18:10] <jtannenbaum> jerks!
[15:18:18] <ajpiano> oh for that
[15:18:36] <gopus> what's the url to jfiddle?
[15:18:43] <ajpiano> ?jsfiddle
[15:19:11] <gopus> ahhhh
[15:19:13] <gopus> of course
[15:19:15] <gopus> yes
[15:19:45] <gopus> does jsfiddle have jquery assumed?
[15:21:52] <duttons> <ckb> would really appreciate some advice as I am really stuck with this... :s
[15:30:32] <duttons> <ckb> : + when I add this it seems to stop the add class that I did before it..  really want to get this implemented but seem to be having trouble..
[15:32:34] <Ogredude> ok, I'm using RSpec + Capybara + webkit.  In my spec, I'm telling Capybara to visit the page, fill out the "Name" field (which has an autocomplete on it), and sleep(3).  I'm looking in my log and I never see the autocomplete search action firing.
[15:32:40] <Ogredude> wtf am I doing wrong?
[15:39:05] <Ogredude> besides attempting to test javascript, that is.
[15:45:28] <radiantstatic> I've got this menu that, when fully opens, is perfectly centered in the page. However, when closed, is not. is there a way to go about changing the total width of the container upon close/open? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/ww7UU/9/
[15:51:09] <Carraway> what's a good lightweight text editor that I can use for html/css/js for os x?
[15:51:18] <Carraway> something in the vein of notepad++ for windows
[15:51:21] <duttons> All ckb has mentioned the .wrap function to add a href to a image src used in a plugin..  could someone have a look at a couple of my lines of code and advise the best place to do this to get the plugin to operate.  I need to be able to add a class to the image displayed in an image wrapper and then add a href to it to point to a seperate url.  in order to get http://professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm this to work here.. http
[15:52:16] <Ogredude> macvim
[15:55:25] <lupomontero> Carraway: macvim rocks, but if you are not familiar with vi/vim it takes a little while to get used to edit modes
[15:55:59] <lupomontero> also, derek wyatt has posted some awesome video tutorials: http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/
[15:57:54] <Ogredude> Carraway:  if you don't mind commercial software, Textmate is pretty damn fantastic.
[15:58:35] <snover> Carraway: komodo edit.
[15:58:50] <snover> oh, you said âlightweightâ
[15:58:52] <snover> itâs mediumweight.
[16:24:56] <jaypitidi> how can i add an if statement so that once .load() is finished loading the requested page it will do something?
[16:30:37] <duttons>  I am trying to add this http://professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm to this http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html could anyone help with some issues?
[16:31:11] <duttons> I need to understand some of the commands which are required to get this implemented.
[16:31:23] <radiantstatic> Anyone?
[16:33:13] <duttons> I want to do the same as this http://www.chaidotsitoura.com/jewels-en.html but on the image wrapper on my site rather than the slider on theirs.
[16:33:35] <duttons> I expect this would be an easy fix for someone who knows..
[16:33:49] <Ogredude> anyone have examples of testing jquery ui autocomplete behavior?
[16:34:58] <gnarf> Ogredude: ummm like the unit tests for autocomplete ?
[16:35:17] <zulax> if i need to reach #my div ul li a and find the a with name="active" -> should i be looking at selector?
[16:35:19] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/autocomplete/autocomplete.html ?
[16:35:25] <zulax> i need to change its css
[16:35:52] <gnarf> $("#my div ui li a[name='active']") ?
[16:36:24] <Ogredude> gnarf:  actually that might be a good place to look.
[16:36:33] <zulax> thanks gnarf that looks so easy
[16:36:48] <Ogredude> if a test case is Setup -> Do Stuff -> Assert Something, I'm completely stuck on the Do Stuff part.
[16:38:38] <vasocreta> Here like a dog with his tail between his legs. Can anyone confirm for me, if you've used the cycle plug-in, if my slide container is a <ul> then the <li>'s become my slides, right??
[16:42:08] <naomi> Can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/qpyKC/  (question: how can I programmatically create an array of the same type that $() returns?)
[16:44:23] <ajpiano> naomi: var y = $();  $.each(texts, function( i, t ) {  y = y.add($("<li>").text(t));    });
[16:44:37] <ajpiano> you create an empty jquery object and add stuff into it
[16:45:07] <gnarf> naomi: you can also pas an array to $()
[16:45:51] <ajpiano> but it would have to be an array of dom elements
[16:46:52] <naomi> ajpiano: so do i add $("<li/>").text(t)[0] ?
[16:47:00] <Suhana> burp
[16:47:08] <macheleon> for setTimout() - driven animations that queue up when a window is blurred and then all play in rapid succession on focus, is this a good / reliable / recommended fix? - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5766263/run-settimeout-only-when-tab-is-active
[16:47:38] <ajpiano> no you just munged the two ideas into one
[16:48:19] <Abbas-> guys , i have some javascript code in my header.php ... the header.php is included on main page, as well as sub pages ... how do i make my javascript execute on sub pages only? like not on abc.com or abc.com/index.php but only to execute on abc.com/anyotherpage.php ?
[16:48:35] <zulax> gnarf,  cant see what i m missing
[16:48:37] <zulax>   $("#header.nav ui li a[title='apply']").css("visibility","hidden");
[16:49:07] <gnarf> case sensitive
[16:49:37] <ajpiano> naomi http://jsfiddle.net/qpyKC/1/
[16:49:49] <zulax> checked, its lower case
[16:50:09] <zulax> hoping #header.nav means header vid and class nav
[16:50:23] <zulax> Ah! its typo
[16:50:25] <zulax> ul ui
[16:50:33] <naomi> ajpiano: awesome! i swear i tried this, but i must've screwed up something
[16:50:46] <ajpiano> naomi: the parent() part is imporant
[16:50:58] <zulax> nop, didnt work
[16:51:10] <ajpiano> wrapAll() doesn't mean the selection you now have is actually the ul, you still have a collection of LIs
[16:51:14] <gnarf> zulax: then its still the wrong selector for some other reason
[16:51:27] <naomi> ajpiano: interesting...
[16:51:30] <zulax> you mean apply or the title part?
[16:51:41] <naomi> ajpiano: would it be better to start from the UL and .append() LI ?
[16:52:18] <ajpiano> once you get the set of LI from map, yes you could also just do $("<ul>").html( y ).insertAfter("div");
[16:52:20] <ajpiano> in this example.
[16:52:45] <zulax> well, now works for some reason, might be cache
[16:52:47] <zulax> thanks gnarf
[16:53:46] <vacho> jquery auto complete works in IE6, but I can't navigate through the results using my arrows...anyone?
[16:55:07] <naomi> ajpiano: .append() seems to work too. should i favor .html() since i know i'm passing in HTML elements?
[16:55:15] <ajpiano> no
[16:55:27] <ajpiano> .you're *always* passing in html elements pretty much
[16:55:29] <ajpiano> to append as well
[16:55:39] <ajpiano> use html when you want to destroy everything inside and set the new content
[16:55:43] <ajpiano> use append when you want to... append
[16:55:48] <gnarf> .html( jQuery ) === .empty().append( jQuery )
[16:55:49] <naomi> ah, got it :)
[17:01:03] <duttons> could someone help me sort a problem out..  I need some help to get a plugin working ..  I would be willing to paypal a little thank you to someone.. its probably a 5 min job..
[17:01:14] <oksushi> no, I replied to you asking âWhat do you think aboutâ¦â â my answer is ânot muchâas in âI donât have a high opintion ofâ¦â
[17:01:17] <oksushi> *opinion
[17:01:27] <oksushi> gah, sorry channel
[17:02:21] <stodge> Anyone using the datatables plugin?
[17:04:36] <vacho> ajpiano
[17:04:50] <vacho> any idea why when I use autocomplete, I cannot use my arrows to navigate through the results in ie6?
[17:05:00] <ajpiano> nope.
[17:06:06] <duttons> can I interest someone in earning a little reward for what i hope would be a 5 min job.. I need to find a way of doing a few things with a plugin..
[17:06:31] <vacho> duttons: what's ur problem?
[17:08:04] <duttons> <vacho>I am trying to get this http://professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm to work on this site within the image wrapper.. so whatever image is in the displayed image wrapper uses the innerzoom function of the cloud-zoom function
[17:08:53] <duttons> <vacho>:so  http://professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm to work on http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[17:09:11] <duttons> I have been trying to find a way of implementing it but having issues.
[17:10:10] <duttons> uuuh  why do people leave just as they ask you what your question is..
[17:11:54] <datlap> I have tab and nested tab. however the nested tab is not gettting loaded.  http://dpaste.com/585896/
[17:13:25] <duttons> I am trying to get this http://professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm to work on this site within the image wrapper.. so whatever image is in the displayed image wrapper uses the innerzoom function of the cloud-zoom function ..  could somone assist, I would be willing to send a little paypal thankyou..
[17:22:36] <jaypitidi> can i attach a success function to .load()? I have a preloader that seems to work but it looks as if the preloader just shows for a second while the document loads. It doesn't look like it waits for the document to load before hide() or fadeOut(). Because on some browsers there is a period where nothing is on the screen and then my content will show up.
[17:23:04] <datlap> I m using jquery tab to make a nested tab. var url however returns UNDEFINED ( var url = $.data(ui.tab, 'load.tabs')). Any idea?
[17:24:03] <aximilation> jaypitidi: .load isn't something that can fail, to my knowledge
[17:24:12] <aximilation> it either fires or it doesnat.
[17:25:02] <aximilation> it's more a matter of when. Some *content* may not load, eg: broken images, but overall the whole page will load at some point, and once everything is loaded as expected your load gets called
[17:30:09] <duttons> could someone help me sort a problem out..  I need some help to get a plugin working ..  I would be willing to paypal a little thank you to someone.. its probably a 5 min job..

[17:35:49] <supsup> if you clone a div and it has an ID, does it create two IDs with the same value in the DOM?
[17:35:50] <ajpiano> duttons: please stop asking that every 5 minutes
[17:36:02] <duttons> sorry my apologies..
[17:36:04] <ajpiano> duttons: you're obviously a bit off in your assessment that it's a five minute job
[17:36:33] <kborchers> supsup: yes, you would need to change the id
[17:36:48] <supsup> kborchers: thanks
[17:46:51] <duttons> <ajpiano> not if someone with experience of doing this sort of thing is around.. I still am sure it would not be a big job.. but I understand that I have posted a little bit too much over the last hour or so.. just eager to get it resolved.
[17:47:48] <ajpiano> the problem isn't the person with the experience, it's relating that experience to someone who does not have that experience that takes a long time
[17:47:54] <ajpiano> :/
[17:48:06] <supsup> duttons: i'll help u if u get me a date with that model
[17:48:10] <supsup> thats my price
[17:49:07] <duttons> haha...  nice...  If I knew her would you think i would be sat in front of my PC at 2am in the morning..
[17:51:00] <duttons> I think I would be able to take it in ajpiano.. I think I just really need help from someone ..  I am very keen to learn more jquery, hard to find the time though with a new baby..
[17:51:52] <supsup> is it a boy? if so you can sell it on the chinese black market and be free of that time drain
[17:53:01] <duttons> <supsup>: would you be able to give a little advice ?
[17:53:27] <duttons> <supsup>: on the problem front, not the model of course..
[17:53:43] <supsup> i don't really know what your trying to do from what you said while i was in here.  you refrence a plugin- but I don't think you mean that site. you should make a jsfiddle of what your trying to do
[17:57:53] <duttons> Its quite simple to explain really..  I am trying to get a plugin that uses anchors and a class to bring in the plugin..  I need it to apply to whichever image is in the #displayed tab.   the site I need it to work on is http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[17:58:33] <supsup> as simple as it is you should still make a jsfiddle example if it is simple then it should be such a simple task to make a jsfiddle!
[17:58:57] <duttons> I will try and sort one now..
[18:09:28] <james13433> Whats the best html tag to wrap a number in so that I can get it and update it?
[18:10:20] <supsup> prob depends on context of what your doing with said #s
[18:10:32] <supsup> like is it tabular data ?
[18:10:37] <supsup> if so then a td?
[18:10:41] <james13433> just on click +1
[18:10:55] <ajpiano> it doesn't matter what tag you do
[18:11:12] <supsup> i'd prob use a span but yah does not matter ~
[18:11:23] <supsup> if the #s are in tabular and in a tables td tho...use the td
[18:11:27] <ajpiano> james13433: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/t9j3E/
[18:11:55] <james13433> I was just trying to think if there was one something that wont change the style, (i have some styleing on a span)
[18:12:29] <supsup> use id like ajpiano and set specific style to it?
[18:12:37] <supsup> so it never changes based on global rules?
[18:12:58] <james13433> ok cheers, supsup
[18:13:10] <ajpiano> james13433: click the 10 here
[18:13:11] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/t9j3E/1/
[18:13:21] <supsup> nice if Ajpiano ~
[18:14:03] <james13433> Cheers
[18:15:34] <supsup> tho i thought crockford said not to use -- and ++ at txJs! i prob misunderstood
[18:16:43] <ajpiano> crockford says you shouldn't have fun on a trampoline
[18:16:52] <supsup> so i don't ever
[18:16:57] <supsup> i jump but keep a frown up
[18:18:41] <supsup> are you entering the nodejs competition ajpiano?
[18:18:47] <ajpiano> naw
[18:18:53] <ajpiano> i have a wedding to go to that weekend
[18:18:54] <tiemonster> Is there a more appropriate place than this to ask a question about QUnit?
[18:21:59] <james13433> if I have the <span>9 clicks</span> how would I decrease that number?
[18:22:24] <supsup> ajpiano gave u perfect example james?
[18:22:29] <james13433> well <span id="click_number">9 clicks</span>
[18:22:45] <james13433> that would work even though its half text?
[18:23:02] <supsup> o put the span dude just around the #
[18:23:23] <supsup> or can they click the text also?
[18:23:25] <tiemonster> james13433: you're storing the number itself elsewhere, right?
[18:23:39] <james13433> well I want that bit styled different so that would need two spans then
[18:23:43] <ajpiano> tiemonster: this is better than nowhere
[18:24:06] <tiemonster> ajpiano: I'm wondering if it's possible to load tests asynchronously
[18:24:06] <james13433> tiemonster, nope wasnt planning on it.
[18:24:07] <supsup> you could use the jquery . data method prob i always want to use that method but never do.  ;/
[18:24:53] <ajpiano> james13433 what you do is this crazy approach called "thinking critically about your problem"
[18:24:55] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/t9j3E/2/
[18:25:30] <ajpiano> "hmm, how do i get the number part of this only, decrement it, and then get the rest of the text from after the number"
[18:25:46] <supsup> heh thats exactly what i was making ajpiano   ur too fast ;/
[18:25:53] <ajpiano> hehe
[18:28:17] <EmoSpice> Understanding that this isn't 100% jQuery related, but I'm interested to see if anyone else has run into this problem.
[18:28:39] <ajpiano> tiemonster: i've never heard of anyone doing it
[18:28:44] <ajpiano> but i'm no authority on that matter
[18:28:45] <tiemonster> EmoSpice: we'll cut you slack because of the nick
[18:28:52] <ajpiano> obviously, it's possible to do async tests
[18:28:59] <tiemonster> right
[18:29:00] <ajpiano> but i don't know about loading tests async
[18:29:05] <EmoSpice> I'm developing a site that's using a couple HTML5 tags (nav being the important one). FF, Chrome(-e +ium), and Opera work fine. IE self-closes the nav tag. Any ideas?
[18:29:14] <EmoSpice> tiemonster: Thanks ;)
[18:29:22] <ajpiano> EmoSpice: are you using an html5shiv
[18:29:47] <EmoSpice> I could be, but I'm currently just setting the css to display: block in my css.
[18:30:10] <ajpiano> you gotta be
[18:30:12] <EmoSpice> (honestly, it's not *THAT* important - I could just do <div id="nav"> >_>)
[18:30:21] <tiemonster> What do you mean self-closes? Is there a closing tag?
[18:30:32] <ajpiano> you can't style html5 elems in IE unless you use html5shiv
[18:30:40] <jtannenbaum> I'm having a problem with jquery-ui, combining two of the features: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/10512/
[18:30:48] <EmoSpice> tiemonster: should be <nav>...stuff...</nav>; is <nav/>
[18:30:52] <jtannenbaum> trying to combine http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/custom-data.html with http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/categories.html
[18:31:23] <EmoSpice> ajpiano: moving to HTML4 and <div id="nav>. Thanks for the insight
[18:31:50] <jtannenbaum> but when I click on items in the menu I get the following: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'data' of undefined
[18:32:00] <swanson___> are there any gotchas involved with POSTing to an API that is using CORS with $.ajax()?
[18:32:16] <jtannenbaum> at this line in jquery.ui.autocomplete.js: var item = ui.item.data( "item.autocomplete" ),
[18:32:17] <swanson___> I can hit the API through curl but not with an ajax post
[18:32:40] <tiemonster> jtannenbaum: then ui.item is undefined
[18:32:56] <tiemonster> swanson___: cross-domain?
[18:32:59] <ajpiano> jtannenbaum... try .data("item.catcomplete")
[18:33:04] <jtannenbaum> I'm wondering why it would be, since both examples on the website works, and all I've done is combine them
[18:33:17] <jtannenbaum> oh
[18:33:19] <swanson___> @tiemonster ya, the server has the Allow-Origin headers set
[18:33:51] <jtannenbaum> ajpiano: but that'd require modifying the plugin autocomplete file, do you think that's wise
[18:33:57] <tiemonster> swanson___: I've never had success doing that
[18:34:00] <ajpiano> no it doesn't... in your own code
[18:34:10] <jtannenbaum> oh
[18:34:13] <ajpiano> like 46, 51
[18:34:17] <ajpiano> not sure if that'll work
[18:34:24] <jtannenbaum> doy, makes sense
[18:34:30] <swanson___> @tiemonster ya in chrome the server returns a 404, in firefox it doesnt even make the request (or at least it doesnt show in the firebug network tab)
[18:34:49] <swanson___> @tiemonster so I dont know if its the browser, my code, the server etc :/
[18:35:02] <tiemonster> then my guess is that cross-domain policy isn't doing what you think it's doing
[18:35:28] <tiemonster> you know it's not the server because curl works
[18:35:32] <jtannenbaum> the issue persists
[18:35:53] <swanson___> well maybe the server isnt setup to handle ajax cross-domain -- but ya I think I can rule out the server
[18:36:00] <tiemonster> jtannenbaum: post your code
[18:36:00] <swanson___> since curl is just a standard post
[18:36:13] <jtannenbaum> <jtannenbaum> I'm having a problem with jquery-ui, combining two of the features: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/10512/
[18:36:31] <tiemonster> sorry
[18:36:36] <tiemonster> what line?
[18:36:44] <ajpiano> jtannenbaum: please make a live demo on jsfiddle
[18:36:58] <ajpiano> with the rendered output from that items loop
[18:37:07] <duttons> is there something that I am doing wrong with jsfiddle.. it doesnt seem to load images in on my plugin but works find on my website..
[18:37:12] <duttons> http://jsfiddle.net/v3SAs/
[18:37:26] <ajpiano> your assumption that you can just mishmosh two demos tegether and assume it'll work seamlessly is certainly a bit naive :)
[18:37:31] <ajpiano> or shall we say, idealistic
[18:37:46] <tbranyen> no u
[18:38:25] <ajpiano> duttons, don't put <script> </script> in the javaScript part of jsfiddle
[18:38:49] <duttons> <ajpiano> thanks
[18:40:27] <mintux> I have several links in list that I want when mouse on over each link.one image (related to that link)fade on center of page
[18:40:44] <tbranyen> so basically a linked list
[18:40:50] <mintux> what should I search for?
[18:41:11] <tbranyen> mintux: have each image in a data attribute on the list item
[18:41:23] <tbranyen> like data-image-url="some/image/path.jpg"
[18:41:39] <mintux>  tbranyen:yes
[18:42:09] <duttons> <ajpiano> still didnt seem to work though.. website works fine but this seems to be missing something..
[18:42:09] <tbranyen> then $("ul.li").mouseover(function() { $(".somemainimage").attr('src', $(this).data("image-path")); });
[18:42:14] <tbranyen> i dunno thats the basics you cna tweak it
[18:42:34] <mintux> each link has a image .when mouse over link a image swap in the position  (but with fade effect )
[18:43:03] <ajpiano> duttons: styles go in the head of a document
[18:43:06] <ajpiano> before any scripts are loaded
[18:43:47] <supsup> duttons: i kind of ment u should make a simple example not just copy your whole website to jsfiddle
[18:43:59] <Shishire> Is it possible to unregister a function from jQuery.ajaxSuccess?  I need to piggyback on a specific ajax call, but I don't want to be notified of every single ajax request the page makes forever.
[18:44:36] <supsup> break down what your trying to do to just that one use case?
[18:46:01] <ajpiano> Shishire: would be better to just tack a success onto that call, innit
[18:46:46] <jtannenbaum> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ZGXRe/
[18:47:59] <jtannenbaum> refer to http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/custom-data.html and http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/categories.html for the desired behavior. Clicking on a menu item is supposed to go to a page corresponding to that item
[18:48:13] <Shishire> ajpiano, no, I don't control the ajax call.  I get notified before the request goes out, but not when it comes in.
[18:48:31] <Shishire> Or, rather, what's the best way to piggyback on select ajax calls that I don't own?
[18:48:53] <ajpiano> how do you know which ones you want to piggyback off of ?
[18:49:50] <Shishire> ajpiano, I get notified when it goes out, and the data coming back has a specified structure.
[18:50:02] <ajpiano> what do you mean, you "get notified"
[18:51:31] <Shishire> I get the function which handles the ajax call as a callback which I have to call.  But since it's asynchronous, I can't just call a function afterwards.
[18:52:15] <ajpiano> you have a reference to the ajax call at some point?
[18:52:26] <gnarf> if not, can you get one?
[18:52:50] <ajpiano> in jquery 1.5 and above you can late-bind a callback at any time as long as you have a reference
[18:53:24] <codeshah> I am creating checkboxes dynamically and then want to check whether they are checked or not - how do I do this?
[18:53:26] <Shishire> no, I can't touch the ajax call at any time.  I just get a reference to the function which somehow makes a jquery ajax call.
[18:54:26] <ajpiano> what environment are you in?
[18:54:45] <Shishire> Heavily custom.
[18:55:23] <gnarf> Shishire: pass in a callback to the function that makes the ajax call?
[18:55:39] <ajpiano> he can't modify that function to tell it to call that callback
[18:55:44] <gnarf> oh
[18:55:55] <gnarf> bitch moan and complain to whoever writes that code
[18:56:34] <ajpiano> Shishire: short of like, making your function that runs on *all* ajax callbacks check for some level of integrity in the response data and then actually invoking the logic you want, without some sort of access to the XHR object, it's pretty much "all or none"
[18:57:22] <Shishire> ajpiano, hmmm, that's what I feared.  I'll see what I can do with all.  Thanks.
[18:57:40] <ajpiano> Shishire: what is the return value of the function that you get
[18:58:25] <Shishire> ajpiano, of the data that comes back from the server?
[18:58:44] <ajpiano> no, of the function that you actually have access to
[18:59:18] <Shishire> um, void I think.  It's making an async call, so I don't think it actually has a return statement.
[18:59:39] <ajpiano> Shishire: FYI, what i'm getting at abstractly here is that that's not necessarily true
[18:59:54] <ajpiano> if the function returns the jqxhr itself you can attach more callbacks to it
[18:59:55] <ajpiano> like this
[19:00:44] <exxy-> I'm attempting to use the .click function on a few divs, and while testing I can get it to work find, but when I attempt to use it on an embedded div it doesn't work at all.. do I need to ID all of the divs in the document? Or something?
[19:00:46] <ajpiano> function watever() {  return $.ajax({ url: "someHiddenServiceLayer.php"  });   };   watever().success(function(data) {  console.log("async call completed");  });
[19:00:48] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[19:00:57] <ProLoser|Work> can i do $(this) inside of live?
[19:00:59] <Shishire> ajpiano... damn... you're right.  I can attach a success handler after .send() is invoked, if I'm still in the same thread?
[19:01:13] <ajpiano> well, there's no concept of "thread"
[19:01:23] <gnarf> Shishire: you can attach a success handler to it after its finished too
[19:01:29] <ajpiano> but yes, in jquery 1.5+, you can attach callbacks to the jqxhr at any time
[19:01:34] <ajpiano> even ^^
[19:01:49] <Shishire> gnarf, really?  cool!
[19:02:45] <Shishire> Yeah, I can force the callback function to return the jqxhr function.  I can't change call signature or functionality, but I can petition to get the return type changed, since it's currently void.
[19:02:52] <Shishire> Awesome, thanks!
[19:03:48] <ajpiano> Shishire:  wooooooooooo
[19:04:11] <ajpiano> it's a great way to allow people to subscribe to the async nature of a call many layers abstracted from the call, as you can see
[19:04:22] <ajpiano> instead of having to bind all callbacks at the time of the actuall xhr
[19:05:38] <Shishire> ajpiano, if it's got it's own success handler internally, will setting .success() overwrite or simply add?  The jQuery.ajax page is woefully inadequate for those kind of details.
[19:05:48] <ajpiano> just add
[19:06:00] <Shishire> awesome.  I can build this :D
[19:08:04] <nascro> Can someone define what a "handler" is in simple terms? "this" and "handler" are two of the most evasive concepts to me.
[19:08:40] <ajpiano> a handler is another name for a function that is bound to "handle" when a particular event of some type happens
[19:08:59] <ajpiano> 'this' is the "context" of a function
[19:09:36] <ajpiano> http://justin.harmonize.fm/index.php/2009/09/an-introduction-to-javascripts-this/
[19:10:44] <nascro> @ajpiano: Thanks for the explanation. What does a simple handler look like?
[19:10:53] <coldhead> can everyone please kill me
[19:10:55] <coldhead> thx
[19:10:59] <ajpiano> $("#foo").click(function(e) { console.log(e):  });
[19:11:16] <ajpiano> the anonymous function there could be said to be a "click handler"
[19:11:27] <imsky> $("coldhead").kill();
[19:12:37] <nascro> So a handler is different from a method in that it's handling an event as opposed to, say, .each() ?
[19:12:43] * macheleon joins in and kills coldhead
[19:14:13] <nascro> I don't think what I just said makes sense.
[19:15:07] <nascro> Because each() works the same way
[19:16:07] <ajpiano> a method is a name for a function when that function is stored as a property of an object
[19:16:24] <Shishire> nascro, a handler is another word for a function.  They're often used interchangeably, but technically, a handler is a response to an event, whereas a function could be anything.
[19:16:26] <ajpiano> in the case of each, you'd probably call the function an "iterator"
[19:16:46] <ajpiano> functions have a lot of interchangable nomenclature depending on exactly how you're using it and hwere
[19:17:26] <mintux> I find this code  http://mrg.name/swap/ I want when mouse come over on A B C D the image swap with fade effect the source is here http://mrg.name/swap/swap.zip
[19:17:46] <nascro> Yeah, so functions, methods and handlers are all the same thing, but different depending on context
[19:18:06] <Shishire> .each() takes a function as a parameter, as does jqXHR.success().  The function passed to .success() could be called a handler, because it handles a successful ajax event.  The one passed to .each() could be called an iterator, as it iterates through elements.  But passing a function as a parameter has nothing to do with it being a handler
[19:18:22] <ajpiano> yeah... to piggyback off what Shishire just said
[19:18:30] <ajpiano> you can have a function... function foo() { };
[19:18:47] <ajpiano> if you attach it to an object... var bar = { baz: foo };
[19:19:06] <ajpiano> now you'd say that "baz" was a method of "bar" even thought it would execute the same function
[19:19:12] <gnarf> function on an object = "method"
[19:19:27] <ajpiano> and then you could do $("something").click(foo) or $("something").click(bar.baz) and then that function or method would be considered a "handler"
[19:19:35] <gnarf> function called in response to event = "handler"
[19:19:59] <nascro> I guess that's why I always say "method" when referring to jQuery functions because they really <i>are</i> methods since they're part of the jQuery object
[19:20:06] <ajpiano> yup
[19:20:08] <Shishire> nascro, yes
[19:20:12] <gnarf> function called in response to completion = "hollaback" = "callback"
[19:20:21] <nascro> Oh shit, you just said callback
[19:20:27] <nascro> Another one of my issues.
[19:20:45] <nascro> There are just a couple of terms that my mind implodes in response to
[19:20:51] <ajpiano> callback is just "give me a function now, i will call it later after some stuff happens"
[19:20:54] <nascro> These are great descriptions thoug
[19:21:04] <ajpiano> that's why handlers are often called "callbacks"
[19:21:12] <ajpiano> because you're passing a function reference to be "called back" when something else has happened
[19:21:15] <nascro> The call back makes sense, but passing functions around doesn't
[19:21:17] <jaypitidi> how can i limit my hashchange plugin from only changing the url on specific classes or ids?
[19:22:15] <Shishire> nascro, in javascript, functions are first class, so they're quite literally just regular objects, and as such variables.  Anything you can do to an object, you can do to a function.
[19:22:31] <Shishire> which means you can pass them as parameters to another function.
[19:22:49] <gnarf> nascro: if you pass a function, you can call it
[19:23:19] <nascro> Okay. Starting to make some sense.
[19:23:35] <gnarf> ?js function testit( callback ) { console.log("i did something"); callback(); }  testit( function() { console.log( "And I got the hollaback" ); } );
[19:23:39] <Shishire> they're very similar to lamba functions in other languages, although there's a technical distinction between the two.
[19:23:47] <nascro> Most of it makes sense to me when I'm "doing" but being able to explain what I'm doing - to myself - is challenging ;)
[19:23:50] <gnarf> too bad bot-t isn't here or he woulda run that for me
[19:23:52] * gnarf kicks bot-t
[19:24:21] <nascro> gnarf awesome, thank you for that
[19:24:37] <macheleon> #jquery is by far the most helpful channel I've come across - php, drupal, mysql, they're more "why are you touching this stuff if you don't already know how to do it"
[19:24:50] <nascro> @macheleon agreed
[19:24:50] <gnarf> macheleon: we're like that 90% of the time too
[19:24:58] <styol> yeah it depends on who is around ;)
[19:24:58] <gnarf> ;)
[19:25:10] <macheleon> nah gnarf I've spent a while here now, it's nowhere near as bad
[19:25:18] <macheleon> true, there's that styol
[19:25:19] <gnarf> macheleon: its all ajpiano's fault
[19:25:22] <nascro> @macheleon you gotta learn somehow. doing is best. broken stuff can be fixed.
[19:25:25] <gnarf> he attracts helpful cool people
[19:25:26] <Shishire> macheleon, agreed.  #jquery tends to answer questions on most everything even remotely related to jQuery, so it's pretty awesome.
[19:25:44] <ajpiano> machelon it completely ebbs and flows though, look what we did to poor duttons
[19:25:47] <ajpiano> :/
[19:25:50] <macheleon> heheh
[19:25:59] <ajpiano> it really depends so much on the type of questions you ask
[19:26:02] <macheleon> yah it does have its moments
[19:26:21] <gnarf> "Don't talk to me, I'm busy eating two bags of dicks"
[19:26:21] <ajpiano> if you ask like "hey, how do functions work and have clear specific questions" you can get help
[19:26:27] <macheleon> and how well you take suggestions too
[19:26:30] <nascro> I could ask programming-related questions all day. I would pay a better-than-me programmer to be my friend.
[19:26:45] <ajpiano> if you  "want to implement the one effect from this website on this other website that looks like creepy child porn and you're sure it will only take 5 minutes"
[19:26:50] <ajpiano> you get considerably less results :/
[19:27:00] <macheleon> lol understandable
[19:27:41] <Shishire> idk though, I love freenode in general.  So much concentrated knowledge, I'm not sure why freenode isn't itself sentient.
[19:27:47] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7592 I have this guys problem, but you closed it wontfix
[19:28:05] * gnarf giggles @ the "view source" bug
[19:28:12] <ajpiano> haha that one is legendary
[19:28:30] <gnarf> legendary and brand new
[19:28:31] <ajpiano> "no, the bug isn't that people can see YOUR source code... it's that people can see MY source code!!"
[19:28:34] <gnarf> it can only get better
[19:28:53] <kborchers> gnarf: i have that same bug on all of my pages!!!!
[19:28:56] <macheleon> oh that reminds me, I do have a question ... I've got the old problem with animations controlled by setTimeout stopping and 'stacking up' when the window loses focus, and then rapidfiring when focus is returned ..
[19:29:07] <nascro> ajpiano: was the link above your blog?
[19:29:09] <gnarf> ahhh good ole 9381
[19:29:13] <macheleon> is this a good / reliable / recommended fix? - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5766263/run-settimeout-only-when-tab-is-active - or is there better
[19:29:20] <ajpiano> nascro: nope, just googled dat
[19:29:20] <gnarf> macheleon: there is a better way
[19:29:37] <gnarf> macheleon: but it will most definitely require restructuring your application
[19:29:48] <nascro> macheleon: something inside me gets excited when I see a stackoverflow link
[19:29:48] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ebowan/11/edit
[19:29:53] <macheleon> wait - is that a trick answer because there's 'always' a better way?
[19:29:58] <ajpiano> nascro:  i have some pretty cut-and-dry stuff on 'this' within jquery here though http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide28
[19:30:16] <macheleon> <3 fixingthesejquery
[19:30:19] <swanson___> is there an easy way to check if an ajax call is properly setting the user/pass credentials on a POST
[19:30:38] <gnarf> macheleon: no, the best way is not to ever "queue" animations from a setTimeout loop
[19:30:50] <gnarf> read the long ass discussion on http://jqbug.com/9381
[19:30:52] <nascro> @ajpiano awesome! thanks for that. checking it out
[19:31:02] <gnarf> and feel free to ask me follow ups
[19:31:15] <gnarf> I get the feeling that noone in the world knows more about this issue than me ;)
[19:31:40] <macheleon> makes sense gnarf, shall do .. I'll be looking for the better alternative that allows you to also pause / stop a timer
[19:31:57] <ajpiano> gnarf: i think the only thing anyone can say to you wrt to that is
[19:32:01] <ajpiano> YOU DESTROYED MY SITE!
[19:32:05] <ajpiano> You bitch!
[19:32:14] <gnarf> ajpiano: hey, it was before me that rAF hit the 1.5
[19:32:31] <gnarf> i think its paul's fault
[19:32:34] <nascro> Hahaha
[19:32:35] <ajpiano> heh
[19:32:41] <ajpiano> nascro: background fyi: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/you-destroyed-my-site :)
[19:33:18] <nascro> WOW I have never seen that
[19:33:23] <nascro> That just made my day
[19:33:47] <nascro> You bitch!
[19:33:48] <coldhead> aww
[19:34:10] <macheleon> oh jesus gnarf that's so simple .. if I'm understanding it correctly
[19:34:10] <kborchers> i love dave's comment on that page
[19:34:21] <gnarf> macheleon: just use the callbacks to queue the nexts
[19:34:25] <macheleon> yeah
[19:34:28] <gnarf> yeah
[19:34:29] <macheleon> derrrrrp
[19:34:30] <gnarf> way simpler
[19:34:35] <gnarf> and less hacky
[19:35:07] <macheleon> that's one of those 'god why did I not just see that' moments
[19:36:19] <nascro> Here's a question: What do you conference-goers get out of the conferences you attend? Does it worth?
[19:36:39] <nascro> i.e., considering jQuery conf
[19:36:41] <gnarf> nascro: i dunno, i'll tell you after i give my talk on animation @ jsconf ;)
[19:36:48] <tdignan> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#api If I call ajaxSubmit, how do I get a response back from it?
[19:37:13] <nascro> @gnarf you'd have a different perspective, then, being a speaker.
[19:37:29] <ajpiano> jqcon is a lot of people's first conf, it was mine
[19:37:31] <gnarf> well, i get to attened all the other talks right? :)
[19:37:45] <kborchers> nascro: i'll be there as an attendee
[19:37:56] <gnarf> kborchers: lucky bastard
[19:37:58] <nascro> @kborchers have you been to conferences before?
[19:37:59] <gnarf> kborchers: ;)
[19:38:06] <ajpiano> it's good to make connections with people, it's a venue for that that can't realy be duplicated on just the plain internet, nascro
[19:38:22] <ajpiano> and obvoiusly there's generally a lot of content that can be eye opening
[19:38:31] <kborchers> yes, not that one but many others
[19:38:34] <nascro> @ajpiano understandable. I guess, honestly, I don't feel like I have anything to offer anyone.
[19:38:39] <nascro> I would learn a ton
[19:39:01] <ajpiano> you never know what someone might ask you to offer
[19:39:14] <tdignan> you could offer me some advice on how to get the http response back from .ajaxSubmit
[19:39:22] <tdignan> I would be quite grateful
[19:39:31] <nascro> I could offer some advice, but I don't know that it would be helpful or relevant
[19:39:32] <gnarf> nascro: if you do decide to go, you might wanna think about doing the bocoup training
[19:40:04] <kborchers> and i agree with ajpiano ... conferences are a great place to make connections and learn ... and see what an ajpiano and a gnarf look like ;)
[19:40:13] <gnarf> tdignan: its probably going to a) return jqXHR, so you can .ajaxSubmit().success( callback ) - or you can pass a success callback
[19:40:25] <ajpiano> tdignan ajaxSubmit({ success: function() { } });
[19:40:27] <ajpiano> ll
[19:40:28] <macheleon> if cons like that ever make it to backwater Brisbane Australia ... I'll jump at them
[19:40:33] <ajpiano> press enter #fail
[19:40:46] <nascro> @gnarf I looked at that briefly. My main thing is this: I learn best by doing. Like, immediately applying what I'm being taught.
[19:40:53] <tdignan> gnarf, ajpiano thanks, that wasn't in the documentation.. probably because it is standard
[19:41:00] <nascro> Going to school, so to speak, isn't as much of a learning experience as actually doing
[19:41:13] <gnarf> school sucks
[19:41:15] <ajpiano> yeah, it statse in tha jaxForm docs that you can pass any option you can pass to $.ajax to ajaxSubmit or ajaxForm
[19:41:20] <nascro> @kborchers I'm not sure I want to know what some of you look like ;)
[19:41:31] <gnarf> i dropped out of high school 15 years ago and never looked back :)
[19:41:37] <tdignan> oh!
[19:41:44] <ajpiano> nascro: ben's training is like, incredibly thorough
[19:41:44] <tdignan> when I read "options" i didn't think of them that way
[19:41:55] <ajpiano> you would probably benefit from it immensely
[19:41:56] <kborchers> nascro: bocuop rocks! if i had the money, i would be doing training
[19:42:05] <kborchers> bocoup*
[19:42:08] <nascro> @ajpiano it looks legit. Their site is solid
[19:42:10] <ajpiano> kborchers: i think you might know how the jqueries work thoug:)
[19:42:18] <ajpiano> nascro: i work there :p
[19:42:31] <tdignan> gnarf: the guidance counselor advised me to drop out, after I showed him a picture I drew depicting my school as a concentration camp.
[19:42:40] <ajpiano> i've seen a lot of sections of those trainings, even done a bit
[19:42:44] <nascro> @ajpiano haha! I had no idea. Otherwise I would have more timidly offered a compliment
[19:42:45] <gnarf> kborchers: i just took the opinion of asking ben if he wanted any help, cuz i like being around learning environments ;)
[19:43:01] <nascro> @gnarf: I'm the same way
[19:43:06] <nascro> Will work for edu
[19:43:32] <gnarf> kborchers: do you know what your travel plans are yet for the conf?
[19:43:52] <kborchers> gnarf: yep flying out friday morning and back late sunday night
[19:43:56] <lenswipe> hey guys
[19:43:56] <lenswipe> j
[19:44:03] <lenswipe> anyone know about CKEditor?
[19:44:13] <lenswipe> its interpreting newlines as new paragraphs >:{
[19:44:23] <gnarf> conf is sat/sun right?
[19:44:26] <kborchers> yep
[19:44:48] <nascro> @kborchers are you speaking, too?
[19:45:05] <gnarf> kborchers won himself a free ride to jsconf via rewardjs.com ;)
[19:45:10] <kborchers> nascro: no, not this time ... but maybe i'll submit something in the future
[19:45:14] <kborchers> that i did
[19:45:33] <macheleon> will these presentations be podcasted
[19:45:38] <kborchers> and i've been hooked ever since
[19:45:47] <james13433> I have a number inside a span I would like to decrease, but due to my cms, it has two on of the same span on the page so I cant use a id how could I get the value of one of the spans?
[19:45:47] <kborchers> they can't get rid of me ;)
[19:45:52] <nascro> Let me ask you speakers something: do you really want to be speaking? I've worked in the pro portrait/wedding photographer industry for several years and know firsthand that some of the speakers - big names - don't honestly care about their presentation
[19:45:52] <ajpiano> we haven't historically gotten good recordings of the conf stuff :/
[19:45:57] <gnarf> likely, considering the release form stated that i had to agree to be filmed for jQuery ;)
[19:46:07] <nascro> @kborchers how'd you score that? awesome
[19:46:22] <ajpiano> kborchers: didn't realise rewardjs was where you turned up from... awesome :)
[19:46:31] <djQuery> james13433: select both of them then just doa .first()
[19:46:52] <kborchers> nascro: check out rewardjs.com ... i fixed a lot of jQueryUI bugs
[19:47:24] <ajpiano> nascro: considering i was heavily involved in the speaker lineup for this upcoming jqconf, i certainly hope that isn't the case :p
[19:47:43] <james13433> djQuery perfect thanks
[19:47:54] <gnarf> nascro: I'm pretty excited to give my first ever presentation, by the time I get tired of it, I'll prolly just stop applying ;)
[19:48:11] <nascro> @ajpiano I worked for some of the speakers at WPPI, ImagingUSA for a few years. "Burnt out" would describe their approach.
[19:48:22] <nascro> @gnarf that's encouraging
[19:48:24] <kborchers> nascro: i have spoken at many other conferences and I can tell you if i didn't want to do it, i wouldn't have.
[19:48:40] <ajpiano> yeah, i personally wouldn't really apply to speak at a conf if i was burnt out on speaking...
[19:48:46] <nascro> @kborchers that's what I would expect
[19:48:53] <ajpiano> but i know a lot of people just like the rhythm of it and get the asks etc
[19:49:07] <nascro> @ajpiano these folks are asked to speak. they don't apply. Is that how web conferences work?
[19:49:15] <nascro> @ajpiano they are paid to speak
[19:49:22] <ajpiano> jsconf and jqcon have calls for speakers
[19:49:43] <ajpiano> and people don't get paid, they get their hotel and maybe their flight covered
[19:49:59] <nascro> @kborchers re: rewardjs that's awesome! congrats on winning
[19:50:00] * gnarf perks up, how is "maybe" determined? :) 
[19:50:27] <kborchers> thanks ... it was awesome. i think my wife hated me after the end of that month though ;)
[19:50:33] <ajpiano> gnarf: depends on the event usually
[19:50:35] <nascro> @kborchers winning, like, 50 things... sheesh!
[19:50:49] <ajpiano> we were able to afford to pay for speaker flights in last san fran, but the hotels are much pricier this time so we can't for the one in boston
[19:50:51] <nascro> What was your 750 gift card to?
[19:51:04] <kborchers> yeah, my goal from the beginning was the conf trip though. the rest was just icing
[19:51:05] * gnarf remembers that large chunk of week were they didn't pull shit
[19:51:08] <nascro> My bro lives 2 hours away... may commute... or use hotel points
[19:51:23] * kborchers screamed at the computer during that week
[19:51:40] <nascro> haha
[19:51:49] <kborchers> nascro: amazon
[19:52:06] <nascro> @kborchers word. those are some solid winnings
[19:52:28] <gnarf> all i got was a PSP and some t-shirts
[19:52:38] <gnarf> oh and a book
[19:52:49] <gnarf> that i gave to someone else cuz i already had it in pdf
[19:53:21] <kborchers> yeah ... my little secret is i did gift returns for all of it to amazon and got a huge credit which i then used to by the 15" MPB with a docking station, keyboard and magic mouse i'm using now ;)
[19:53:40] <gnarf> and now i will not be eligible for another rewardjs if they do it :)
[19:53:52] <kborchers> only if its jquery narf
[19:53:54] <kborchers> gnarf
[19:54:00] <ajpiano> neither will kborchers at this rate :D
[19:54:03] <kborchers> heh
[19:54:05] <gnarf> well jQuery UI
[19:54:17] <gnarf> i don't have commit on jQuery either
[19:54:24] <kborchers> still don't have commit access so i'm still in
[19:54:42] <nascro> What's an example of a bug you fixed?
[19:54:54] <nascro> How do you approach fixing bugs, anyway?
[19:54:59] <Shishire> jqcon is in boston this year?  Sweet, I might be able to go to it!
[19:55:03] <nascro> I guess it's much like I would debug my own stuff.
[19:55:06] <kborchers> and since it took me 15 tries today to get one of my pulls merged, it'll probably be a while before i get commit access
[19:55:41] <gnarf> kborchers: i think scott / jÃ¶rn / richard were just lonely when they gave me commit access ;)
[19:55:52] <kanzie> is there a limit as to how many parallel jsonp-requests I can make? My app starts by making like 9 of them concurrently and two always fails, but its random which two
[19:56:16] <kborchers> nascro: you can do it now if you want ... no prizes but great way to learn the guts of jQuery and jQueryUI http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[19:56:25] <gnarf> why in gods name would you want that many parallel requests in an app? :)
[19:57:00] <gnarf> oh shit
[19:57:01] <nascro> @kborchers: i'll check it out
[19:57:02] <gnarf> that reminds me
[19:57:07] <gnarf> i was gonna review a pull
[19:57:10] <Shishire> kanzie, well, most browsers set a limit on the number of concurrent resource requests...
[19:57:15] <gnarf> i got so sidetracked into that damn FF position bug
[19:57:17] <gnarf> i forgot
[19:57:25] <kborchers> nascro: you'll need to read all the guidelines and learn git if you don't already know it
[19:57:43] <nascro> I'm mildly familiar with git
[19:57:52] <kanzie> Shishire: ok, when this happens I get error in consoleâ¦ I wonder how I can avoid this. Do I have to write a "crowd-control" or something
[19:58:23] <nascro> @kborchers I would love to see someone's git workflow for a web project where they're responsible for everything.
[19:58:31] <nascro> @kborchers O
[19:58:45] <gnarf> nascro: mine looks like a damned octopus
[19:58:48] <Shishire> kanzie, which kind of an error?  An error from javascript, or does your browser itself throw an error?
[19:58:48] <nascro> @kborchers I'm self-employed and most of my projects are small, so I do everything.
[19:58:58] <nascro> @gnarf haha
[19:59:11] <gnarf> nascro: but i leave a lot of branches to die
[19:59:24] <gnarf> like half finished optimizations and shit
[19:59:36] <kanzie> since Im using jsonp it seems to register as a failed resource-load but it does not seem to prevent further execution. Im a bit puzzled right now so I think I need to poke at this some more first
[19:59:45] <nascro> How do you mentally track that?
[20:00:05] <swanson___> @tiemonster finally found the problem :) something was getting messed up with the Authorization headers
[20:00:21] <swanson___> @tiemonster setting it manually made it work
[20:00:32] <gnarf> nascro: thats the point, i usually don't ;)
[20:00:38] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah, i need to clean up a lot of branches. i have one for every bug i worked on and some have 2 or 3 versions and then i have all of my branches for menu and position
[20:01:07] <gnarf> kborchers: heh, want to compare "git branch | wc" ? :)
[20:01:19] <kborchers> heh
[20:01:21] <gnarf>      35      36     500
[20:01:33] <gnarf> i just did a purge about a month ago
[20:01:36] <nascro> Random question: if I push a mysql file into a populated db, does it overwrite the entire db or append data to it?
[20:01:42] <nascro> Sorry, sort of off topic
[20:01:44] <gnarf> where i cleaned all my branches that were pulled/merged
[20:01:57] <nascro> @gnarf haha sheesh
[20:02:14] <gnarf> like 13 of those branches are in effects
[20:02:16] <kborchers> wow, you got me beat 9      10     138
[20:02:19] <gnarf> which i haven't touched in a while
[20:02:26] <gnarf> 15 of them are ticket branches
[20:02:37] <gnarf> 3 of them are tracking other peoples remotes
[20:03:07] <gnarf> how about a compare of git remote | wc ? :)
[20:03:17] <gnarf> i got 13 of those ;)
[20:03:25] <gnarf> oh wait, 14 now
[20:04:03] <nascro> @kborchers: current state of the site you've been adding input. coming along http://bit.ly/q3Qg4A
[20:05:07] <kborchers> nascro: cool, looks like your arrows are still a little off though, huh?
[20:05:47] <gnarf> anyone know if ' is a valid character for an html ID?
[20:05:50] <nascro> @kborchers: yeah, moving between the projects popup and the photos popup somehome messes things up.
[20:05:57] <gnarf> bot-t isn't here with his trusty ?validid
[20:06:02] <nascro> I changed the arrows to neutral for the time being, but will fix them in time.
[20:06:47] <nascro> @kborchers the current number variable is acting weird. I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it.
[20:07:02] * kborchers attended bot-t's funeral earlier today :(
[20:08:07] <kborchers> nascro: best thing is to try to simplify in a fiddle or something then work back into your situation
[20:09:02] <nascro> @kborchers getting from simple example to implementation is what's f-ing everything up.
[20:09:09] <kborchers> heh
[20:09:32] <Shishire> gnarf, ' is not valid
[20:09:51] <nascro> Heading out west next week for vacation. Hopefully I can retain some of this info #humblebrag
[20:10:06] <Shishire> from w3.org: * ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[20:10:42] <kborchers> well, folks i'm out. good night
[20:10:59] <kborchers> ?tell yourself to get your act together tomorrow
[20:11:06] <kborchers> oh right, stupid lazy bot
[20:11:19] <nascro> @kborchers take care man
[20:11:33] <kborchers> later
[20:12:25] <vandemar> nascro: the contents of the mysql dump that you're using determine whether existing tables get overwritten.  more than likely, they will be.  mysqldump typically inserts statements that drop and recreate tables before inserting data
[20:13:11] <nascro> vandemar: Context = WordPress, so based on your comment, they probably are overwritten. Thanks for the response.
[20:18:20] <tdignan> If I want to set a value somewhere in the blob of HTML I have is there a better way to do it than using a span, and selecting it to set the text?
[20:21:54] <Shishire> tdignan, not really.  There's no real way to select a specific piece of text, only html elements.
[20:21:55] <Phrogz_> tdignan: Nope, that seems pretty good to me.
[20:22:15] <tdignan> thanks, I just wanted to know if I was doing it right
[20:22:38] <hopperfest> What's a good solution for copying something to the clipboard on the press of a button?
[20:23:02] <exxy-> I'm trying to update the text inside of a <input type="text"...> I'm looking for something like.setAttr, what function am I looking for?
[20:23:26] <Shishire> exxy-, .value()
[20:23:30] <exxy-> AH thank you.
[20:24:17] <exxy-> ..wait, does that exist?
[20:24:33] <Shishire> exxy-, .value() works on all manner of input controls which makes it convenient.
[20:24:45] <exxy-> I can't find the documentation for that function
[20:24:50] <Shishire> Um.... it should...
[20:25:01] <exxy-> I know .val() gets the value..
[20:25:05] <Shishire> bah
[20:25:11] <Shishire> you're right.  .val()
[20:25:27] <Shishire> pass a value to .val(), and it becomes a setter
[20:25:40] <exxy-> thank you
[20:25:54] <Shishire> exxy-, sure, sorry about the confusion
[20:29:22] <GoGoGarrett> Has anyone worked with "CSS 3 Media Queries for all Browser" plugin? I'm trying to get a site work with ie7, and it's just not going well at all
[20:34:56] <htoothrot> i feel your pain buddy, i've still got to consider IE6 for one of my apps !#^!@
[20:35:12] <htoothrot> fortunately not with anything css3 related
[20:37:02] <GoGoGarrett> I'm just trying to get media quires to work in IE7, I have tried beating it up with pure css specific stylesheets and stuff, but to no avil.  So I found a query plugin, that seems to work..not :P
[20:37:20] <austen>  Is there a javascript equivalent to variable references? I have an object that I would like to return a reference to an array, as opposed to returning a copy of the array...
[20:38:30] <sunscreen> herm
[20:40:27] <sunscreen> function blabla() { var WTF; $.get("myphp.php",{}, function (phpdata) { WTF=Number(phpdata); }); echo WTF; ]  <-- returning undefined ????
[20:40:53] <sunscreen> strang things is it works else where in my code fine
[20:41:16] <coldhead> JS has no echo
[20:41:19] <coldhead> is a problem
[20:41:29] <sunscreen> echo == alert
[20:41:33] <coldhead> and then WTF won't be set to that value until the ajax returns
[20:41:39] <coldhead> which could be whole seconds later
[20:41:45] <sunscreen> ah
[20:41:57] <sunscreen> can i make it block some how
[20:41:59] <coldhead> you can either do the work inside the callback (preferred)
[20:42:05] <coldhead> or make it synchronous
[20:42:11] <coldhead> async: false
[20:42:16] <coldhead> bad idea
[20:42:20] <coldhead> ?ajax
[20:42:28] <coldhead> oh no bot :)
[20:43:02] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:43:08] <coldhead> check the bit about async
[20:43:12] <coldhead> but avoid it if possible
[20:43:17] <coldhead> it makes your users cry
[20:43:29] <sunscreen> kk
[20:43:36] <sunscreen> relocating to the callback
[20:43:46] <sunscreen> i hope the global still work in there
[20:43:58] <coldhead> should do!
[20:46:35] <sunscreen> that is mad its like the callback is in an entirely different time
[20:46:45] <sunscreen> but yet its all happening in the same bit of script in <head>
[20:46:48] <coldhead> that's the magic of the first A in AJAX
[20:47:41] <Shishire> sunscreen, it is actually happening at a different time.  You're passing in a reference to a function which is stored, and then executed at a later time, once you get a result.
[20:49:15] <tdignan> ajaxForm is amazing
[20:50:08] <gnarf> its a pretty solid plugin
[21:03:01] <coldhead> you crushed the lily in my soul
[21:04:15] <tdignan> What's the best wrapper around HTML5 local storage?
[21:04:29] <tdignan> I am looking at jstorage.info.. not sure if it's what I am looking for or not
[21:11:44] <gnarf> tdignan: local storage is a pretty darn simple dom api
[21:11:52] <gnarf> why do you need a wrapper?
[21:12:12] <alexparker> anyone in here done any jquery/javascript with twitter's api?
[21:12:16] <tdignan> for cases where the browser doesn't support it, or it's IE and it's different, or something.
[21:12:29] <wookiehangover> gnarf: JSON.stringify is really hard to type...
[21:12:39] <gnarf> tdignan: and what exactly do you want to do when unsupported?
[21:12:43] <gnarf> there is no good "fallbck
[21:12:43] <wookiehangover> that's why I use a wrapper >_<
[21:12:49] <tdignan> I don't know
[21:12:54] <gnarf> wookiehangover: yeah, but you wrote that wrapper prolly ;)
[21:13:02] <tdignan> have you seen jstorage.info?
[21:13:14] <gnarf> tdignan: there isn't really a suitable fallback for localStorage
[21:13:30] <alexparker> i want to make something to work like this: http://cl.ly/919V when you hover over the twitter username link
[21:13:54] <tdignan> gnarf: www.jstorage.info says I can persist data even after a browser crash
[21:14:04] <tdignan> on browsers as old as IE6
[21:15:45] <wookiehangover> gnarf: well... ya ;)
[21:16:03] <schizm> hello all, what sort of arbitrary socket access (accept on any specified port, send out to arbitrary ips/ports) is available security and library wise nowadays in a JS client in browser?  I'm porting over an app to be a webapp and need some real time communication with other types of hardware.
[21:17:19] <schizm> im looking at using JQuery as my main framework with JQuery UI for the UI building blocks
[21:18:01] <schizm> I looked at socket.io but it doesn't look as open access/arbitrary as I need
[21:20:47] <schizm> hm, guess it's not possible :(
[21:22:03] <vandemar> any network access that's not mediated by the browser would have severe security implications, not the least of which defeating things like Tor.
[21:22:25] <schizm> vandemar: this is a secure situation, LAN based, internal tool...so that is fine
[21:25:04] <sunscreen> is clear timer the only way to bust out of a timer function
[21:25:15] <sunscreen> clearTimeout/clearInterval
[21:31:13] <gnarf> sunscreen: its the only way to cancel one before it is fired, yes
[21:32:25] <sunscreen> so in a function reference thingy you have to do it before the function ends and hope that it can cancel in time
[21:36:00] <gnarf> huh?
[21:36:08] <coldhead> wat
[21:36:22] <gnarf> sunscreen: either it fired, or it hasn't
[21:36:35] <gnarf> if you cancel it, it cancels it
[21:37:01] <coldhead> what about schroedinger's cat though, gnarf?
[21:37:05] <coldhead> you ever think about that?
[21:37:10] <gnarf> both
[21:37:10] <sunscreen> hmmz its like it just ignore my conditions like its triggering more times then the variable can increment
[21:37:21] <gnarf> its is both canceled and fired until you can observe the result
[21:37:26] <sunscreen> lol
[21:37:45] <gnarf> are you sure you aren't setting it multiple times and only canceling the latest?
[21:37:47] <gnarf> ?p

[22:07:27] <wangdoo> Hello all
[22:08:03] <wangdoo> I have a table when i click on 8 th column click event shoudl not work.How to do this?
[22:08:58] <ciriuz> try nth selector
[22:09:49] <wangdoo> ciriuz: Is this correct td:not(:nth-col(8))
[22:11:05] <ciriuz> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[22:12:41] <wangdoo> ciriuz: The reason for using not is,when i clcik on that column click event should not work
[22:12:45] <olinux> $(function(){  $.fn.bindStep.defaults.prevBtn = 'Prev'; }); ... Error: $.fn.bindStep is undefined
[22:13:08] <olinux> this works on my test site bu undefined on live site
[22:13:12] <olinux> any ideas?
[22:14:44] <tdignan> I thought a click event would be consumed by the browser unless I call event.preventDefault()?
[22:15:27] <tdignan> I have a .click set on <a href="#">foo</a> and it runs the code in the handler, but the normal browser behavior (a page refresh) does not happen
[22:15:40] <tdignan> doesn't the browser get refreshed when you put a "#"? or am i misunderstanding
[22:17:54] <tdignan> I must be inaccurate on that.
[22:17:57] <tdignan> Putting in a location.reload();
[22:20:50] <ciriuz> @wangdoo
[22:20:51] <ciriuz> if the nth-child isn't working for you try :eq(7)
[22:25:16] <olinux> whats the difference between $(function() { });
[22:25:38] <olinux> and (function($) { })(jQuery);
[22:30:31] <lupomontero> the first back is a callback to be run on dom ready
[22:30:55] <lupomontero> the second one is a closure into which you pass a ref to the jQuery object, nothing to do with dom ready
[22:32:48] <olinux> thanks lupomontero
[22:33:07] <olinux> step1.bindStep(step2, {nextValidator: step1_validator}); .. step1.bindStep is not a function
[22:33:21] <olinux> not sure why this plugin works fine on one server but not the other
[22:34:05] <aximilation> Question: I think it's more css than anything, but I'm assigning a long number to an element like this:         $('#performance').html(value);
[22:34:30] <aximilation> ...and no matter what size I set the element to be via css, the object overflows/resizes it
[22:34:51] <aximilation> I have white-space:nowrap;overflow:hidden;width:95px; Any thoughts?
[22:35:21] <aximilation> After it is called I end up with this: <td id="performance">0.060390949249268</td>
[22:36:34] <lupomontero> olinux: is that the babysteps plugin? http://coryodaniel.com/index.php/2008/08/22/babysteps/
[22:36:45] <olinux> lupomontero, yes
[22:37:33] <olinux> this site has jquery included twice i think it fixes when i remove 1.4.2 and leave 1.6.0
[22:37:52] <olinux> however i used the exact html on test site just fine
[22:37:56] <lupomontero> olinux: do u have a link i can look at?
[22:39:33] <olinux> ya
[22:39:50] <sunscreen> can i pass variable to setTimeOut when its callback?
[22:39:57] <sunscreen> s/ss
[22:40:29] <sunscreen> setTimeout(function (myvar) {},323); == faileth
[22:40:41] <wangdoo> olinux: using selector on table,when i click on one particular column click event should not work.i used td:not(:nth-child()) but this is not working
[22:43:03] <olinux> lupomontero, working url is working again, i flushed cache and killed the js that was hard coded
[22:43:36] <lupomontero> olinux: nice one, sorted then?
[22:43:59] <olinux> lupomontero, well now it works in firefox but not chrome
[22:44:38] <olinux> hm also not IE
[22:48:32] <lupomontero> olinux: the problem might be the Uncaught ReferenceError, as js execution will stop on the error
[22:50:39] <sunscreen> k now that is something valuable to learn
[22:50:58] <sunscreen> http://www.makemineatriple.com/2007/10/passing-parameters-to-a-function-called-with-settimeout <-- might want to put that in the bot
[22:59:03] <lupomontero> sunscreen: you could also use a function to create a closure and return another function to be used as the callback. something like: http://jsfiddle.net/9ANGD/
[23:00:42] <sunscreen> coo
[23:03:34] <Shabana> Can anyone tell me why I get an error with the following code in the new version of jquery:
[23:03:43] <Shabana> setTimeout("$('div.MTGdecks_stats_graph').hide().show()",5000);
[23:03:50] <Shabana> I get a $ is not a function error
[23:04:01] <Shabana> Would really appreciate any help from anyone
[23:04:24] <lupomontero> sunscreen: a while back i posted an short article on my blog about closures: http://lupomontero.e-noise.com/blog/using-javascript-closures-to-create-private-scopes
[23:04:40] <lupomontero> sunscreen: blatant plug :-S
[23:05:14] <sunscreen> tnx I'l have a a read on that after i have a cat nap :D
[23:07:58] <lupomontero> Shabana: try putting the code you wanna run inside an anonymous callback function
[23:08:04] <lupomontero> Shabana: something like: http://jsfiddle.net/yDuac/1/
[23:09:04] <lupomontero> Shabana: although, doing hide() and immediately after show() looks a bit weird, is that on pupose?
[23:10:20] <lupomontero> sunscreen: i think i need to sleep too... to much caffeine though
[23:10:52] <sunscreen> lol
[23:11:24] <sunscreen> a pillow feels awesome
[23:11:30] <sunscreen> i just reseted my head
[23:13:04] <lupomontero> ok, now srsly, time for bed, tomorrow got to finish this plugin (http://demos.e-noise.com/jQuery.locationPicker/) and haven't looked at it in IE yet
[23:13:25] <Shabana> Lupomontero: how do we declare an anonymous function in jquery
[23:13:50] <Shabana> The code used to work in a previous version of jquery
[23:14:20] <lupomontero> Shabana: an anonymous function is a javascript thing, not jQuery. it is basically a function declared without a name, normally to be used as a callback
[23:15:13] <Shabana> Thanks, will look that up.
[23:15:18] <lupomontero> Shabana: ie: $('a').click(function () { alert('ha!') });
[23:15:46] <lupomontero> in that case we basically call the click() function and pass it an anonymous function as an argument
[23:16:12] <lupomontero> Shabana: this "callback" will be invoked later in time, when a click event actually happens
[23:17:32] <Shabana> Got it, I understand that, it's just I'm trying to make sense of someone else's code, and a bit confused doing that.
[23:17:39] <zoran119> hey, i'm trying to use jquery ui dialog to confirm user's action (are you sure you want to follow the link)
[23:18:14] <zoran119> the dialog stops the default action, but i want the default action to happen if they click 'yes'
[23:18:27] <zoran119> how do i not block the default action?
[23:19:27] <lupomontero> zoran119: in that case you would need to take action on the second click which is a different event
[23:20:09] <lupomontero> zoran119: not sure if i understand the problem
[23:20:22] <lupomontero> zoran119: too tired...
[23:20:25] <zoran119> lupomontero: sorry, maybe i am not describing it well...
[23:21:01] <zoran119> lupomontero: to use the dialog i have to put 'return false;' at after .dialog('open')
[23:22:10] <zoran119> lupomontero: then in the button click handler (inside the dialog init configuration) i want to keep going to the link the user clicked on (if they click 'yes' on the dialog)
[23:22:23] <zoran119> but the 'return false' is stopping it
[23:22:28] <zoran119> :)
[23:22:36] <zoran119> :( actually
[23:23:12] <lupomontero> zoran119: the 'return false' in the first link should have nothing to do with it...
[23:24:04] <lupomontero> zoran119: when you click on the second link (inside the dialog) you can handle the click and go to the location the first link was going to go to
[23:24:47] <lupomontero> zoran119: you could reference the first link in the click handler for the second one and use its href property
[23:26:08] <zoran119> lupomontero: that's what i want thinking... but it's ugly.. the user already clciked on a link - it would be much cleaner just the interrupt the default action if they click 'no' and don't touch anyting if they clicked 'yes'
[23:27:12] <lupomontero> zoran119: i know, but since user input is needed, you need to stop and that involves handling two events...
[23:28:23] <gnarf> zoran119: pop the dialog by passing a variable equal to what you clicked
[23:28:44] <gnarf> $dialog.data("href", this.href).dialog("open");
[23:28:50] <gnarf> also you prolly don't need return false
[23:29:04] <gnarf> you probably only need event.preventDefault()
[23:29:41] <gnarf> and then in your "yes" button you can grab the .data("href") from the dialog
[23:30:16] <lupomontero> gnarf: event.preventDefault() is indeed prettier :-)
[23:30:34] <gnarf> return false means a lot of things
[23:30:38] <drd> it's not just prettier, it means something else
[23:30:44] <gnarf> so know what all of them do
[23:31:04] <gnarf> event.preventDefault(); event.stopPropagation(); event.stopImmediatePropagation()
[23:32:00] <lupomontero> gnarf: indeed
[23:32:52] <gnarf> wtb bot-t
[23:32:55] * gnarf cries
[23:35:39] <lupomontero> a bot? not really, just a very tired man...
