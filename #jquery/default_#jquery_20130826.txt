[00:55:56] <eeezkil> any good open source javascript charts besides jqPlot (http://www.jqplot.com/)
[01:09:05] <rvr87> anyone happen to know if .each goes over object sequentially?
[01:09:14] <rvr87> objects*
[01:22:29] <Narhir> Hi..
[01:22:33] <Narhir> I have some silly questions
[01:22:48] <Cork> rvr87: each goes over the object in the order the keys exist in the object
[01:22:48] <Narhir> trying to make the "Close" link actually CLOSE a div
[01:22:50] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/aZVhz/
[01:23:15] <Cork> Narhir: if you don't want a link; don't use a link
[01:23:21] <Narhir> in addition I think it would be nice if someone would click on siblings of "waterfall-block- wrapper it would close it as well
[01:23:54] <Narhir> well... I really need to learn jquery
[01:26:42] <Kambfhase> $('#linkid').on('click',function(){ $('#divid').slideUp() })
[01:27:26] <Cork> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/aZVhz/2/
[01:27:50] <Cork> Narhir: live has been depricated for a long time; stop using it
[01:28:09] <Cork> use delegate in older versions or on in newer ones
[01:29:48] <Narhir> thats neat thank you Cork
[01:29:52] <Narhir> cork++
[01:29:52] <Narhir> hmm
[01:29:54] <Narhir> however..
[01:30:38] <Narhir> if I have something like that :http://jsfiddle.net/aZVhz/3/
[01:30:59] <Narhir> is there any clever way to make it like "if another green block is clicked" close the previous "popup" opened?
[01:31:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/aZVhz/4/
[01:32:06] <Narhir> can you tell me what did you changed?
[01:32:11] <Narhir> you added event ?
[01:32:42] <Cork> line 3
[01:34:39] <Narhir> hmm I see so we hide all .popup-waterfall-block and then we show this ppup-waterfall-block
[01:34:40] <Narhir> thank you!
[01:40:54] <houser> Hello, i am using twitter bootstrap 3.0. I made a fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/5Qrwj/1/   Why does "menu" and "content" stack on the second smallest resolution? Is there any way to avoid that, so that it only stacks on the smallest resolution?
[01:41:12] <zemanel> hellooo
[01:43:22] <Narhir> Cork: sorry for bothering you even more but is there any easy way to "add class" to element on which we clicked ?
[01:46:30] <xkr47> Narhir, http://api.jquery.com/
[01:46:30] <xkr47> Narhir, if you look there, the third method is addClass()
[01:51:07] <Narhir> thank you xlr47 :) I really need to learn.. it is there any book you guys would reccomend or.. tutorials ?
[01:51:46] <Cork> ?g learn.jquery
[01:51:46] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/
[01:52:20] <Cork> Narhir: additionally api.jquery.com will help for most cases if you know the basics
[01:55:43] <Narhir> hmm I really need to learn the basics
[01:55:52] <Narhir> thank you guys you were really helpful ! :)
[02:04:00] <sarahm_22> hello, im writing my first jquery function and im having some trouble. im trying to fetch some data from a remote server using ajax , in a django app. i wrote it that way http://bpaste.net/show/iCcCu9bFcBHvQ1ZsbdjN/
[02:04:54] <sarahm_22> it works fine, except that i will have to make about ten requests, each to a different url and i don't know how to write it, should i just repeat the call to request function ? doesnt seem DRY.
[02:04:59] <Cork> sarahm_22: why do you need to chain ajax load it?
[02:05:05] <veiz> hi, anyone knows how to load jStorage correctly? I got a 'undefined' typeerror when $.jStorage, see here -> http://pastebin.com/Z4CtncDu
[02:05:24] <sarahm_22> Cork : i dont get you
[02:05:43] <Cork> sarahm_22: you first do $.ajax (get) and then $.post == $.ajax (post)
[02:06:03] <Cork> why the double ajax calls?
[02:06:18] <sarahm_22> Cork : the get is to get the data from a remote server, then i send it back to django server
[02:06:32] <Cork> O_o
[02:06:54] <Cork> so your doing a cors load of the data and then push it to your server?
[02:07:37] <sarahm_22> Cork: yes, This is for the other developers who will be using my app, who don't know much of javascript and prefer to write python/html to code the way they want the data to be displayed and make use of the django template engine for custom tags and stuff
[02:07:40] <Cork> sarahm_22: sounds like something you should do server side, not through the client
[02:08:10] <Narhir> I guess it is illegal to do something like that:     $(this).children.addClass( "bottom-red-arrow" ); is there any other way to combine it ? or I need to create a function ?
[02:08:24] <Cork> Narhir: $(this).children()
[02:08:31] <sarahm_22> Cork :the data fetching? i want it to be done client side, so the load will be on the client and not the server
[02:08:47] <Cork> sarahm_22: the load will still be on the server
[02:08:57] <Cork> except it will depend on the client too, and add load there too
[02:09:19] <Cork> i don't see the point of over working it like this
[02:09:53] <Cork> it will just make it complex and fragile, without changing the load on the infrastructure in a meaningful way
[02:09:54] <sarahm_22> Cork: well if i don't do a post and just have something like $.html() or $.append() then the load will be on the client right?
[02:10:02] <Cork> yes
[02:10:29] <Cork> but if you want the data to your server, have the server get it, it will be more efficient
[02:11:40] <sarahm_22> Cork: ok i guess i'll do it that way then there are just a few exception where i ll need the data to the server. but still i don't know how to send multiple ajax requests without repeating it in a dumb way
[02:12:08] <silverspring> Hey guys im getting "Missing required field: licenses[0].url." error from this jquery.json package file https://raw.github.com/hakanersu/jquery-bildirim/master/bildirim.jquery.json Any idea what im missing ?
[02:12:12] <Cork> sarahm_22: if the server can concatinate the data just make a range request
[02:12:27] <doonie> sarahm_22:  send everything you need only 1 in a json object
[02:12:33] <Cork> sarahm_22: if you can only request individual sections, you will have to duplicate the requests
[02:12:52] <Cork> so again it is a server side limitation, not ajax
[02:14:09] <OnkelTem> Hi
[02:14:29] <OnkelTem> If I do e.preventDefault(), can I restore original behaviour after that?
[02:14:31] <sarahm_22> Cork : well if i dont send the data back to the server and just have it rendered by js, i ll have to duplicate the requests?  something like : http://bpaste.net/show/yI4atZz1gy2nGkc3VWHa/ , but then how can i know which response goes where on the page ?
[02:14:38] <Cork> OnkelTem: no
[02:15:24] <sarahm_22> doonie : if i do so, the server will have to parse them again ?
[02:15:39] <Cork> sarahm_22: none of them will go on the page, as you don't actually add the data to the page
[02:16:12] <doonie> exactly, you do what you need, return a json back and you can do multiple things with 1 request instead of many
[02:16:17] <Cork> sarahm_22: when you append the data it will be appended in the order the requests ends
[02:16:36] <Cork> json isn't the only way to do that
[02:16:50] <Cork> xml and html can do it too
[02:17:00] <Cork> it is only about if the server can send the data that way
[02:17:16] <sarahm_22> well i changed my code to have : $("#Content").html(data.text()); so it will appear, the problem is since the requests are sent to different servers the requests doesn't end in the same order they're send so its confusing
[02:17:28] <Cork> heck a plain text response can also, as long as you know how the sections is divided
[02:17:46] <Cork> sarahm_22: ya, you can't know when they end
[02:17:54] <Cork> sarahm_22: even if they where to the same server
[02:18:13] <Narhir> hmm.. is there somethng like parent of a parent ?
[02:18:21] <Narhir> or sibling of a parent ?
[02:18:24] <Cork> ?api closest
[02:18:25] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:18:55] <Cork> Narhir: sibling of a parent would have to be exactly that
[02:18:59] <doonie> sarahm_22:  just keep it simple :)
[02:18:59] <Cork> .parent().siblings()
[02:19:17] <sarahm_22> Cork : :/ so how can i do that then ? i'm confused
[02:19:29] <Cork> sarahm_22: do you have control of the source server?
[02:19:30] <Narhir> thank yu
[02:19:33] <Narhir> gonna try both
[02:19:36] <doonie> cork my guess is no ;D
[02:19:40] <Cork> sam here
[02:19:46] <Cork> but i don't want to assume
[02:20:09] <sarahm_22> no :)
[02:20:26] <Cork> sarahm_22: then you would have to have targets in the dom ex. id's
[02:20:45] <sarahm_22> well i have that
[02:20:45] <Cork> and when the request finises add the content to that specified id
[02:20:57] <Cork> you can
[02:21:13] <Cork> * you can't guarantee the order with any other solution
[02:21:16] <sarahm_22> wait a sec i'll paste you a small example of what i'll have
[02:21:39] <Cork> sarahm_22: then just pass the uniq id to the request function
[02:21:46] <Cork> and use that when you run the .html() call
[02:21:53] <Cork> should be as simple as that
[02:23:11] <sarahm_22> so i should have something like that http://bpaste.net/show/DVDcWbow8UdGiMhqH77r/
[02:23:28] <Cork> $(id) ya
[02:23:32] <Cork> not $("id")
[02:23:46] <Cork> or possibly $('#' + id)
[02:23:54] <Cork> depending on how you want to pass the id
[02:24:14] <sarahm_22> ok :) and then in my html have http://bpaste.net/show/nQMoYWZqjfECFUepaMQm/
[02:24:18] <Narhir> .parent().siblings() worked but the closest() didnt
[02:24:19] <Narhir> thanks :)
[02:24:39] <Cork> Narhir: closest works to find the parent of parents
[02:24:52] <sarahm_22> the only thing that is bothering  me is to have to call the request function many times instead of passing a list or something
[02:24:57] <Narhir> ahh gotcha but not the sibling of one of those parents
[02:25:11] <Cork> Narhir: $(this).closest('.granparent') <div class="granparent"><div><target></div></div>
[02:25:25] <Cork> Narhir: ya, and that was the second answer :)
[02:25:27] <doonie> sarahm_22:  your own server can do all the calls in the backend, thus having 1 ajax call ;P
[02:25:28] <Narhir> got the idea :)
[02:25:34] <Narhir> good to learn
[02:26:02] <Cork> sarahm_22: how fresh does this data have to be?
[02:26:20] <Narhir> hmmmm I really really like this jQuery :) just got idea how to make it all cooler
[02:26:27] <Cork> sarahm_22: simplest is prob to have an update script sync the data from the remote server on an interval
[02:26:31] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented the .remove function but I think that it not works in mi iphone with safari. Any suggestion?
[02:26:37] <sarahm_22> doonie: seems like a good idea except that i want the calls to be done client side
[02:26:39] <Cork> and then just get everything from your own server
[02:27:02] <doonie> well you can't have everything :)
[02:27:12] <sarahm_22> Cork: very, ill have to do some long polling or smthn so it coulb be updated all the time
[02:27:37] <Cork> sarahm_22: you can only do longpulling if the server supports it
[02:27:52] <sarahm_22> the thing is the app is embedded so i want to keep the biggest load on the client
[02:28:06] <Cork> sarahm_22: also you normally don't want to do ajax calls to a third party from the client side, you have quite a chance of exploits there
[02:28:19] <doonie> if you let your server do the calls, you can cache it, instead of letting the clients it req. 1000 times on each visit.. As my guess is you want to avoid being detected for getting someone else's content :)
[02:28:36] <sarahm_22> doonie : no it's not that
[02:29:01] <Jaycob> hey, how do I compare two elements? like so: $(".set").last() === $(this)
[02:29:29] <Jaycob> without assigning id's that it
[02:29:29] <Cork> Jaycob: $(".set").last()[0] === this
[02:29:29] <doonie> Jaycob:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407825/how-to-compare-two-elements-in-jquery
[02:29:42] <doonie> 2second google search ;D
[02:29:55] <Narhir> ok.. guys.. so I have some like that: http://imgur.com/oAaqxtJ it is all in responsive markup of bootstrap.. so each column have a span3 class and each row have a "row"
[02:30:02] <sarahm_22> my servers app will be on an electronic device and the webserver that gives the data on the same device too, so no cross domain requests, but since all of this lives on the same device, the poor thing wouldnt stand those many ajax calls , thats why i want it to be client side
[02:30:03] <Cork> Jaycob: you can't compare javascript objects, but you can compare dom elements
[02:30:12] <Cork> Jaycob: so just grab the raw dom element and it should work fine
[02:30:17] <Jaycob> thanks! I tried google, must've searched with the wrong query
[02:30:18] <Narhir> the popup have position absolute to overwrite the fixed width that is setted on it by the "span3"
[02:30:42] <Jaycob> yes, it's working now! wonderful!
[02:30:57] <seutje> is can also do that
[02:31:07] <seutje> $('.foo').is(someReference)
[02:31:18] <Narhir> now I'm thinking if I can do something like .parent().parent().parent().sibling ( that is just below in the DOM) so it would select .row that is below our currently parented .row....
[02:31:36] <Narhir> I'm not sure if I'm explaining it in understandable way.... I doubt it
[02:31:44] <seutje> u can even use it to compare entire sets
[02:31:54] <Cork> Narhir: you normally want to use .closest when you end up in those situations
[02:32:23] <Cork> Narhir: you don't want to change a long list of parent() calls, it easily becomes very fragile
[02:32:37] <Narhir> so in my case it would be like .closest('.row').sibling(just below in dom) ?
[02:32:39] <Narhir> is there a way?
[02:32:45] <Narhir> like .nextSibling ? or something like that
[02:32:58] <Cork> ?api next
[02:32:58] <b-ot> Cork: .next(): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[02:33:10] <hazardous> can anyone recommend a plugin or something for html tooltips that supports loading via ajax? half the ones i've seen don't even support 1.10.2
[02:33:14] <Narhir> hmm cool
[02:33:42] <Cork> hazardous: there should be a tooltip in jquery ui
[02:34:03] <Cork> hazardous: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[02:34:10] <Narhir> I could add a "class to this element" and add margin top.. probably but is there a way to find this sibling and "Sldie it down" ?
[02:34:41] <Narhir> probably ?api slide
[02:34:51] <Narhir> ?api slide
[02:34:51] <b-ot> Narhir: No matches.
[02:34:56] <Narhir> ?api slideDown
[02:34:56] <b-ot> Narhir: .slideDown(): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[02:34:56] <Cork> ?api slideDown
[02:35:01] <b-ot> Cork: .slideDown(): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[02:35:04] <Cork> :)
[02:35:44] <Narhir> hmm but it doest seem to allow to slide by fixed amount of pixels..
[02:35:59] <Cork> ?api animate
[02:35:59] <b-ot> Cork: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[02:39:11] <hazardous> Cork: would you by any chance know what object or whatevre is returned if i use a content: callback function with jqui tooltip? the url i need to ajax is different and is based on the <span data-id="xxx" data-lang="sv">
[02:40:15] <Cork> hazardous: not sure what you mean
[02:40:42] <Cork> hazardous: what you do is content: function(callback) { $.ajax().done(function(data) { callback(data); }) }
[02:40:55] <hazardous> like, basically i need to assemble the ajax url so that it's different for each tooltip - like <span class="tooltip" data-id="3" data-lang="sv">3</span> -> /tip/3/sv is the url to retrieve
[02:41:02] <Narhir> cork I decided to just go with add class and adding margin
[02:41:04] <hazardous> i would have over 400 tooltips all with a different url on the page
[02:41:05] <Narhir> for now :)
[02:41:29] <Cork> ah
[02:41:38] * hazardous is not very good with $(this) and this
[02:42:12] <Cork> hazardous: no can't way i've tested that part, but i expect this to be the target element
[02:42:52] <Cork> ya it is
[02:43:28] <Thoams> var sectionContents = $(stuff[i].outerHTML).filter(":not('script')"); works just fine: could someone help with how to filter out divs having a certain class too? something like...   .filter(":not('script')").filter(":not('script')").filter(":not(div[class='myclass'])");    ?
[02:43:29] <T13|sleeps> Just  make sure the function it's wrapped in defines the element
[02:43:42] <Cork> hazardous: var self = $(this); self.data('id') + '/' + self.data('lang')
[02:43:50] <hazardous> ahh ok
[02:43:53] <hazardous> that will work in function(callback){} ?
[02:44:07] <Cork> Thoams: use the function alternative to filter
[02:44:18] <Cork> hazardous: yes
[02:44:23] <Thoams> thanks, I'll give that a crack
[02:45:44] <hazardous> thanks
[02:52:57] <Narhir> ok.. my brilliant jquery code.. basicaly work
[02:54:27] <Narhir> It removes the ".row-slide" class for my .row element when someone clicks on "CLOSE"
[02:54:47] <Narhir> but.. if someone cliks like on another thumbnail it doesnt remove the class
[02:54:47] <Narhir> heh
[02:58:11] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/aZVhz/6/ it works as.. designed if someone uses "close" but it doesnt remove the margin if someone doesnt uses the clsoe button
[03:00:24] <Cork> Narhir: what is it your trying to do?
[03:00:43] <seutje> holy poop
[03:00:45] <seutje> this needs more $(this)
[03:00:49] <Cork> :D
[03:01:18] <Narhir> I'm trying to make it that if someone clicks on any other "waterfall-block-wrapper" it would remove class "row-slide" same as it do when someone clicks on close..
[03:01:31] <Narhir> so I guess removing the $(this) from third line is good idea to start.. heh
[03:01:41] <Cork> Narhir: but why do you need all the extra closest and the like?
[03:02:04] <Narhir> too specify where is this lass which should be removed ?:)
[03:02:20] <Cork> Narhir: just find them all and remove them
[03:02:39] <Cork> no need to be specific if you want to close them all
[03:02:54] <Narhir> $("row-slide").removeClass; ?:)
[03:02:58] <Cork> yes
[03:03:06] <Cork> with a dot though
[03:03:19] <Cork> $(".row-slide").removeClass(".row-slide")
[03:03:21] <Cork> opps
[03:03:24] <Cork> * $(".row-slide").removeClass("row-slide")
[03:04:10] <Narhir> yes it works! :)
[03:04:16] <Narhir> awesome thanks
[03:04:35] <Cork> Narhir: so think simple, no need to over complicate things
[03:04:36] <Narhir> so.. seutje what wrong with so many $(this) should I wrote it in better way ? (newbie friendly)
[03:04:53] <Cork> Narhir: you wrap the dom element in a new jquery object every time
[03:05:05] <Cork> you can either chain them, or use a variable
[03:05:10] <Cork> var self = $(this)
[03:05:18] <seutje> I usualyl use $this
[03:05:20] <Narhir> yes.. I thinkI should add margin bottom to the .row instead of selecting next of the row and adding margin top ...
[03:06:05] <Narhir> I really think I'm quite good at complicating things that I'm trying to do
[03:06:53] <Narhir> I was also thinking that it would look "COOL" :) if I will add slide down animation to show up the .popup-waterfall-block and slide down while addin margin...
[03:07:01] <Narhir> but it would be to cmplex to then I think
[03:07:21] <Cork> Narhir: na, that isn't complicating it
[03:07:28] <Cork> Narhir: and no it isn't that hard to do
[03:07:58] <Narhir> so I'm gonna try
[03:08:05] <Cork> Narhir: the problem i was talking about is when you make the code more complex to the the same thing as you can express in a simple manner
[03:08:17] <Cork> *to do the same
[03:08:24] <Narhir> heh true..
[03:08:40] <Narhir> I'm qutie good at CSS but jQuery -.- is just... I need to learn it :)
[03:09:08] <Cork> Narhir: jquery selectors work a lot like css, so if you know your way around there
[03:09:21] <Cork> you should be able to figure out simple solutions for jquery too
[03:09:32] <Cork> much of the same logic is used in both
[03:09:50] <Cork> (as both is restricted by the limitations in dom)
[03:12:52] <Thoams> Nrggh.
[03:16:11] <Narhir> hmm
[03:16:19] <Narhir> I think I got it :) http://jsfiddle.net/aZVhz/6/
[03:16:48] <Narhir> quite simple actually, the thing I'm worried about is the arrow..
[03:17:49] <Narhir> http://imgur.com/oAaqxtJ currently the arrow is a class added on click to the thumbnail but if the rest SlideDown it should be fine but on SlideUp it wont look nice I think
[03:18:45] <Thoams> Sorry guys, hate asking again but am pressed for time. Filter help plx? http://codepad.org/2TOmVKdA
[03:19:32] <Thoams> ^ and I can't just do $(".removable").remove();
[03:19:37] <Thoams> before teh filter
[03:20:07] <Narhir> hm nope it doesnt work :( because of my adding margin with the CLASS .. it instantly adds or instantly removes the margin :/ so the slide up and down looks terrible
[03:20:12] <Cork> Thoams: you can't remove the children based on the parent
[03:20:48] <Cork> Thoams: if you want to select something like that you would have to do $('#stuff').find('*').filter(function(i) { })
[03:20:59] <Cork> Thoams: filter only runs on the element you have selected
[03:21:17] <Thoams> would the wildcard find every child and run my filter against each?
[03:21:31] <Cork> Thoams: alternatively you could do $('#stuff .removable') or $('#stuff').find('.removable')
[03:21:37] <Cork> Thoams: yes
[03:21:59] <Thoams> can I do .find('not:[.removable]') ?
[03:22:12] <Thoams> no, you juuuust said that
[03:22:17] <Thoams> err... k
[03:22:18] <Thoams> thanks
[03:22:21] <Thoams> again :)
[03:22:24] <Cork> $('#stuff .removable').not('.removable')
[03:22:41] <Cork> uh sorry
[03:22:53] <Cork> $('#stuff').children().not('.removable') could be a solution
[03:23:02] <Cork> though it would only look on level
[03:23:15] <Thoams> yeah, the wildcard find I think might be the best bet
[03:23:21] <Thoams> will be over the moon when I get this
[03:23:25] <Kambfhase> .find(':not(.removable)') shoudl also work
[03:23:44] <Cork> though that would be a more costly search
[03:24:33] <Cork> Kambfhase: you normally want to avoid the :commands
[03:24:53] <Kambfhase> yeah
[03:26:11] <Thoams> ah, crap
[03:26:17] <Thoams> find not removable does remove the removable
[03:26:23] <Thoams> but it does find .removable's children
[03:26:29] <Thoams> and they need to get cut too >.<
[03:27:56] <Thoams> sorry guys, and thanks for trying to help
[03:28:04] <Thoams> I'll keep at it...
[03:32:12] <MagePsycho> hi guys
[03:32:13] <MagePsycho> http://jsbin.com/EtiXIvu/1/edit
[03:32:21] <MagePsycho> i want to check the first radio button
[03:32:43] <MagePsycho> http://jsbin.com/EtiXIvu/2/edit
[03:33:47] <netiul> how do i remove all css classes starting with "url-" from an element?
[03:34:06] <netiul> removeClass("^url-") won't do it :)
[03:35:49] <T13|sleeps> First you have to retrieve the whole class name, then substring(4, length of class), addClass(truncated new class), remove old class.
[03:36:58] <netiul> T13|sleeps, I'll go with that!
[03:37:39] <T13|sleeps> There might be a shorter way, but that should work.
[03:37:57] <ph88> MagePsycho:  looks like the first one is checked, nice :)
[03:38:14] <MagePsycho> ph88 but what i am not getting id
[03:38:14] <Cork> netiul: you don't
[03:38:36] <netiul> T13|sleeps, i was hoping for a shorter way :)
[03:38:47] <ph88> MagePsycho:   alert(firstRadio.attr('id'));
[03:38:47] <Cork> netiul: if you need that it most likely means you have constructed the classes a bit... over complicated
[03:41:30] <netiul> Cork, I see it more like this: make use of all the possibilities it offers :)
[03:42:01] <netiul> Cork, anyway this use case is not so easy as it may sound
[03:42:15] <Cork> netiul: i mean it sounds like you use compound class names, instead of using multiple class names
[03:42:43] <Cork> netiul: css do support selecting on multiple names
[03:42:56] <Cork> "url section name something"
[03:43:06] <Cork> .url.name.something.section {}
[03:43:29] <Cork> and if you construct it that way you shouldn't have to remove a large number of class names from the elements
[03:44:23] <netiul> Cork, it problem is more that i don't know the classname, except that it start with url-
[03:45:19] <Cork> netiul: only option would have to handle the class attribute manually then
[03:46:43] <houser> is there a good class in twitter bootstrap to create text overlay on images?
[03:46:58] <xqo> hi
[03:47:12] <xqo> doug65536 are you here?
[03:47:15] <netiul> Cork, yes, but i was hoping to use attribute selectors, it seems i have to do it manually indeed, thanks
[03:47:30] <doug65536> xqo: yes
[03:47:33] <netiul> something like $( this.element ).attr( "class").split(" ").each()
[03:48:02] <xqo> is it OK if i pm you, doug65536?
[03:48:10] <doug65536> xqo: yes
[03:49:21] <MagePsycho> http://jsbin.com/EtiXIvu/2/edit
[03:49:34] <MagePsycho> how to trigger click funciton with radio : http://jsbin.com/EtiXIvu/2/edit
[03:49:37] <netiul> eh, which probably doesnt work since it cant iterate over a plain array, anyway like that
[03:51:52] <Cork> netiul: $.each($( this.element ).attr( "class").split(" "), function() {})
[03:52:05] <netiul> right :)
[03:52:36] <ph88> MagePsycho: looks like you did it
[03:52:58] <MagePsycho> ph88 but how to trigger the click function, did you check it
[03:53:11] <ph88> by clicking with your mouse
[03:53:59] <ph88> maybe instead you want to add or remove event handlers depending on whether the radio button is set
[03:54:05] <ph88> so you can use .on() and .off()
[03:57:37] <Thoams> by jove
[03:57:41] <Thoams> I think he's done it!
[03:57:56] <Thoams> I can be guaranteed the depth of children that I need removing
[03:58:02] <Thoams> huzzah!
[04:00:40] <mink> Hi guys. Anyone can explain this?   ----> http://s13.postimg.org/xfxvdq4nr/wtf.png          (Sorry It's on png but It's best way to show thatg)
[04:16:19] <thaifood> hi, in jQuery, how can I submit my serialized formdata using GET to the same page please ?
[04:16:41] <thaifood> i have a click listener workin on the form and  e.preventDefault();
[04:19:26] <Kambfhase> .trigger('submit')
[04:19:36] <xec_> mink: is it possible that the arrays are filled and emptied as you type commands?
[04:20:06] <Cork> thaifood: $.get('', ); should work if you want to use ajax
[04:20:23] <thaifood> i didn't want ajax because i want the entire page to reload
[04:20:46] <Cork> thaifood: then you need to use a normal form submit
[04:20:48] <thaifood> this is my current code  http://fpaste.org/34780/13775160/
[04:21:02] <Cork> thaifood: so serializing the form isn't usefull
[04:21:32] <thaifood> i see
[04:22:08] <thaifood> i need to do validation checking on the fields and then submit using GET
[04:22:45] <thaifood> i just dont' know how to submit the form manually in jquery using get
[04:23:22] <Lolzy> Useing GET as in PHP's GET?
[04:23:33] <mink> xec_, I don't know why console.log executed in the same time returned different values for the same object, but It was async thing and I fixed this
[04:23:36] <thaifood> as in a form submission GET/POST
[04:23:50] <Lolzy> Thats juse the html part, not jQuery
[04:24:58] <thaifood> this is what i'm trying to do  http://fpaste.org/34782/16289137/
[04:25:04] <thaifood> line 9
[04:26:16] <Lolzy> .trigger('submit')
[04:26:57] <thaifood> thanks, i'll give it a try. :-)
[04:27:22] <Lolzy> or $("form").submit()
[04:27:24] <Lolzy> Hmm
[04:27:54] <thaifood> the 2nd one seems to explicitly have the form id so that makes sense to me
[04:28:02] <Lolzy> and the html, <form method="get"></form>
[04:30:24] <Lolzy> It dosnt' use the id, but the tag
[04:30:47] <thaifood> tag ?
[04:30:49] <thaifood> oh
[04:30:50] <Lolzy> So it would trigger all (for only the first) form
[04:31:15] <thaifood> i just have one form so that should be fine
[04:31:21] <Lolzy> Jep
[04:34:17] <thaifood> seems to work,  thanks so much
[04:34:25] <Lolzy> Np
[04:34:40] <seutje> don't bind click on the button
[04:34:44] <seutje> bind on the form's submit
[04:35:00] <seutje> there's a ton of ways to submit a form without even touching your mouse
[04:35:03] <thaifood> seutje i changed that :-)  everytime i entered a form value it clickde :-)
[04:35:15] <seutje> oh my
[04:35:26] <seutje> so when they hit return, they still bypass it all
[04:48:28] <noaXess> hey all
[04:49:40] <seutje> noaXess: hey
[04:50:23] <noaXess> if inside a jquery plugin functions are defined, how to call them from outside?
[04:50:44] <Cork> noaXess: unless the plugin exposes is in some way; you can't
[04:50:52] <noaXess> hm.. ok..
[04:50:54] <seutje> noaXess: the plugin needs to explicitly expose them
[04:51:00] <noaXess> plugin is http://www.vissit.com/projects/eventCalendar/
[04:51:26] <seutje> noaXess: rather than just stating the problem what is your goal?
[04:51:32] <noaXess> inside is a function that will be called on click to eg. the month or day... and i want call this method from outside.. to handle it with own buttons..
[04:51:36] <seutje> I accidentally the comma
[04:51:53] <anjaly> In my jquery mobile ios phonegap application, i use iscroll. On using iscroll, text boxes behave weirdly (move up and down on entering each character).  I enabled iscroll in my app by,data-iscroll in the content div, data-tap-toggle="false" data-transition="none" in header for making header fixed.nw i can"t type in textfield while  i am focusing  the scrolling occures ,hw can i fix this,any one pls help me?...
[04:51:58] <thaifood> you accidentally what the comma,  finish your sentance
[04:52:02] <seutje> noaXess: u can fake the click action
[04:52:07] <Cork> noaXess: you mean flags.wrap.on('click','.eventsCalendar-day a',function(e){ ?
[04:52:46] <thaifood> i accidently ATE the comma ?
[04:52:58] <thaifood> i accidently EXPLODED the comma
[04:53:06] <thaifood> a vital verb is missing
[04:53:16] <seutje> hahahaha
[04:53:23] <noaXess> Cork: the method is getEvents().. and i want call it from externally... like <a id="click_me">click me</a>, js: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6028374/
[04:53:23] <seutje> ?g I accidentally the whole thing
[04:53:23] <b-ot> seutje: I Accidentally | Know Your Meme → http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-accidentally
[04:53:38] <thaifood> i accidently deleted the comma ?   i accidently added the comma ? could be anything
[04:54:09] <Cork> noaXess: ya, that function is private, you can't access it
[04:54:13] * thaifood turns up Michael Franks and all problems disappear
[04:54:53] <seutje> noaXess: all u can do is trigger a click on the same element
[04:54:59] <seutje> or rewrite half the thing
[04:55:09] <noaXess> Cork: so.. i have to emhance the plugin, so i call call it outside, right?
[04:55:28] <noaXess> ^ can call ^
[04:55:33] <Cork> noaXess: that or trigger the event like seutje talks about
[04:55:55] <seutje> but that's not an option if you're trying to avoid the other stuff going on in that handler
[04:56:05] <seutje> or you'd have to re-undo that crap
[04:56:19] <noaXess> okey.. seutje so trigger can be a solution.. hm..
[04:56:31] <Cork> noaXess: but ya, that plugin isn't very extendable
[04:56:37] <noaXess> trigger, means. simulate a event, right?
[04:56:41] <Cork> it could have been written a lot better
[04:56:44] <seutje> yeah
[04:56:44] <Cork> yes
[04:56:53] <seutje> yeah this plugin seems rather wonky
[04:57:08] <noaXess> the calendar starts with current day.. and i want to make a filter.. so i can set start/end date to show
[04:57:19] <seutje> lots of repetition, unconfigurable magic stuff, ...
[04:57:25] <noaXess> any other, similar plugin, that can have start/end date filters?
[04:57:37] <seutje> UI datepicker?
[04:57:54] <seutje> prolly heftier, but it's quite tested
[04:58:03] <noaXess> seutje: datepicker don't has a calendar view like this, right?
[04:58:04] <CygnusS> hi! i can not load jquery ui if i assign jquery to a global name like this: SomeName = jQuery.noConflict(true). If i load ui i get a $ is not defined error. What can i do?
[04:58:33] <seutje> oh, you mean with like a list of events?
[04:58:38] <CygnusS> sorry, its $ is not a function
[04:58:44] <noaXess> seutje: jep..
[04:58:44] <seutje> nah, might not be an easy fit for this then
[04:58:55] <noaXess> thats why customer chooses this one ;)
[04:59:07] <noaXess> so triggering.. might be the way.. hm..
[05:00:23] <seutje> CygnusS: check the order of the files in your document
[05:00:48] <seutje> noaXess: yeah, u can even set those attributes it uses to call that function, so u could easily trigger it with whatever options u wanted
[05:01:03] <seutje> within the limits of how that handler handles those attributes
[05:02:49] <seutje> site crashes IE8 onload... gogo gadget debugger!
[05:03:08] <noaXess> seutje: i want to create two datepicker fields, to change daterange.. now.. have no clue how to make the trigger :]
[05:03:15] <thaifood> ie8 can die
[05:03:37] <seutje> thanks, that helps!
[05:04:14] <seutje> noaXess: well, you'll need to create a selector to match whatever date is associated with your button
[05:04:27] <seutje> then just call .trigger('click') or just .click() on it
[05:04:46] <seutje> (I prefer the former, less confusion)
[05:06:13] <seutje> remove a line, see if it loads up, remove a different line, see if it loads up, rinse/repeat -_-
[05:06:33] <CygnusS> seutje: i load jquery before ui. If i set the noconflict like SMT = jQuery.noConflict(true) i would normaly call the jQuery object like this: (function ($) {$function{}}) (SMT) - UI does not know about this.
[05:07:12] <seutje> CygnusS: jQuery would still be on the global that way, so if it goes all (function($){})(jQuery), it should still work
[05:07:25] <seutje> unless you went all window.jQuery = undefined;
[05:08:11] <noaXess> seutje: there are two click events... one for ".eventsCalendar-day a" and other for ".monthTitle".. how to trigger th correct one?
[05:08:56] <seutje> noaXess: well, I'm assuming you're looking for the day-buttons, not the month headings
[05:09:58] <seutje> noaXess: actually, u can target $('#dayList_' + numberOfDay + ' a')
[05:10:06] <noaXess> seutje: yes.. i want create two datepicker fields.. where i can enter from and to date.. and then.. it should show only that range.. but i think i have to enhance the plugin.. to show only a date range..
[05:10:06] <ravenzz> so I am trying to implement this infinite scroll, http://jsfiddle.net/kPzfa/ it works fine when scrollContent is the document, but really I want it to work with other elements too eg. '#content', could someone think of a better way to do so?
[05:10:33] <seutje> noaXess: oh, yeah, that might be quite some work
[05:10:39] <noaXess> grrr..
[05:10:51] <seutje> sorry, I guess? :(
[05:11:21] <noaXess> seutje: i have to.. cause can't find any other plugin, that does show calendar in this way..
[05:12:05] <noaXess> so i have to make a public function, which i caan call with date range.. and in this public function, private functions are called to show up the calendar.. as normal.. hm..
[05:12:54] <sarahm_22> hello, i have a little xpath problem, i wrote a function that gets an xml then parses it and shows the value i need given an xpath, i use the jquery xpath plugin, here it is : http://bpaste.net/show/2Eg3uKakstgwdnbYBlUa/
[05:13:42] <sarahm_22> the problem is when i have an xpath like that "/foo/bar", i have to access it using ".text()"
[05:14:12] <sarahm_22> but wheni have an xpath like "/foo/@bar" i have to use it with .value()
[05:14:27] <sarahm_22> i don't know how to combine both in my function so i have a generic function i can call no matter the case
[05:25:03] <sarahm_22> in other words, im looking for something that combines val() and text() no matter the type of data , any idea anyone ?
[05:28:58] <fn> is there something like $('*[name=foo]'); to select the element with name foo?
[05:30:24] <le_gars> hello, I have a quesiton about .serialize() on form data? Im using .serialize on a form when sending it with an ajax post. But feels as though its not working as I thought it did
[05:30:50] <le_gars> when I do an alert on html on success I get so much more than the form
[05:31:55] <le_gars> I get like the whole page
[05:41:59] <seutje> ?api attribute selectors
[05:42:22] <seutje> fn: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[05:42:35] <seutje> most are the same as CSS attribute selectors
[05:58:08] <Croves> Hi guys, I'm trying to build a simple dropdown menu. Everything it's ok, except for this doubt: what's the proper event to trigger to hide the dropdown menu? Because I'm showing the submenu in the .mouseover() and hiding it in the .mouseout(), but the problem is when I'm going to access the submenu, the .mouseout is triggered and the menu is hidden
[05:58:56] <Cork> Cronoh: use mouseenter and mouseleave
[05:59:02] <Cork> ?api mouseenter
[05:59:03] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseenter(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[05:59:06] <Cork> ?api mouseleave
[05:59:08] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseleave(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[05:59:18] <Croves> Cork is that for me? :P
[06:01:39] <ravenzz> so the idea behind infinite scroll is  var $window = $(window); $window.on('scoll', functioin () { if ($window.scrollTop() + $window.height() == $(document).height()) { /* load more */ } }); right?
[06:02:23] <Cork> Croves: yes
[06:02:31] <Croves> Cork hehe thank you
[06:02:37] <Croves> Didn't know those events
[06:03:04] <Cork> ravenzz: no you need scrollHeight
[06:03:16] <Cork> Croves: those aren't real events
[06:03:39] <Croves> Yeah, whatever…
[06:03:42] <Cork> Croves: but mouseover and mouseout triggers every time you move from one element to another
[06:03:49] <Cork> Croves: and that includes child elements
[06:04:08] <Cork> Croves: but enter/leave does the check to exclude child events
[06:04:15] <Croves> oh, right...
[06:04:16] <Croves> Good to know…
[06:04:23] <Croves> thank's, mate =)
[06:05:24] <ravenzz> Cork which is undefined for the document
[06:07:22] <Cork> ravenzz: document.documentElement.scrollHeight
[06:07:33] <Cork> but i think chrome needs a fallback if i remember correctly
[06:08:35] <ravenzz> well $(document).height() returns the same value as document.documentElement.scrollHeight
[06:08:48] <Cork> then go for it
[06:09:01] <Cork> just make sure it work in all browsers
[06:09:12] <ravenzz> ok but that's not the problem.
[06:09:37] <Cork> then what is?
[06:10:02] <ravenzz> The thing is that I would like to load more when I am near the bottom, plus throttle the event handler fn
[06:10:11] <ravenzz> which changes things a bit
[06:10:47] <Cork> ravenzz: so add the margin you want
[06:10:52] <Cork> it's simple math
[06:11:04] <fn> seutje: the problem is, i'm don't know, what kind of element it is (textarea or input), so i search only for the name attr
[06:11:45] <seutje> fn: if you're trying to match an exact value, it's just $('[name="someName"]')
[06:11:50] <ravenzz> Cork because of the throttled fn $window.scrollTop() + $window.height() could never be equal to $(document).height()
[06:11:52] <seutje> where someName is the name you're looking for
[06:12:05] <seutje> fn: you don't need to quote them, but it beats having to escape
[06:12:17] <fn> ah thanks a lot, i will try it now
[06:12:34] <Cork> ravenzz: why not?
[06:14:48] <ravenzz> Cork I am trying to pictuare how it work, I guess $window.scrollTop() will be increased of an X amount on "scrollEnd"
[06:15:26] <ravenzz> meaning that its value + $(window).height() could surpass $(document).height() - margin
[06:15:29] <_pash> hello currently i am using node to run my website, if i want to convert it to be single page 'app', do i have to create a jquery load script for every button?
[06:15:30] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/zvtapcdkw6bnsnuar8b2g - I can't figure out how to uncheck the checkbox if the fields are disabled - what am I dowing wrong?
[06:15:53] <ravenzz> picture*
[06:15:58] <ravenzz> +s
[06:17:41] <Cork> ravenzz: scrollTop is the scroll position from the top, height is the height of the viewport
[06:17:58] <ravenzz> yep
[06:18:07] <Cork> ravenzz: scrollTop + height + [margin to bottom] >= scrollHeight == scroll
[06:18:14] <Cork> or rather == fetch
[06:18:19] <Cork> it's as simple as that
[06:18:44] <Cork> [margin to bottom] is how far from the bottom you want the fetch to trigger
[06:18:53] <ravenzz> sure
[06:19:08] <Cork> and if you have a placeholder you add, take it into account
[06:20:00] <MagePsycho> how to remove active class from that ul only: http://jsfiddle.net/Gy39P/32/
[06:20:01] <MagePsycho> any idea
[06:23:17] <Cork> from what ul?
[06:24:28] <MagePsycho> yes if a is clicked in first ul then it should remove active class from that ul > li > a only not from 2nd ul
[06:26:04] <ravenzz> Cork I am afraid that in that way fetch more is fired multiple times
[06:26:44] <Cork> ravenzz: not if you checkes if you have one pending
[06:27:05] <Cork> there is little point firing more then once at a time
[06:27:54] <ravenzz> well let me see what I can do
[06:32:38] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[06:33:01] <|RicharD|> anyone know how setting the max value to Any/All to slider of jquery ui ?
[06:39:07] <Cork> value to any/all ?
[06:39:54] <|RicharD|> example
[06:40:11] <|RicharD|> Cork: i have a slider with range 0 - 100 but i want add also like max value: All/Any
[06:40:52] <Cork> |RicharD|: all/any isn't a value, so what do you mean by that?
[06:40:57] <|RicharD|> so if i have all/any i must have or a big number like 100000 or 0 or null, so i can manage in backend
[06:41:21] <Cork> well have the slider go from 0 to 101 and have 101 be the all then
[06:41:23] <|RicharD|> for example i want that user choice min budget 50$ and max budget not definited
[06:41:35] <|RicharD|> Ok it's fine
[06:41:39] <|RicharD|> how i can do that
[06:41:48] <|RicharD|> 101 is showed like All/Any ?
[06:52:41] <Cork> |RicharD|: well the slider doesn't show any value so just max: 101
[06:52:47] <seutje> getElementsByClassName isn't dynamic, is it?
[06:54:14] <Cork> seutje: dynamic in what sense?
[06:54:43] <Cork> seutje: some core dom lists modify in real life as you modify the dom
[06:54:54] <seutje> foo = document.getElementsByClassName('foo'); document.appendChild(someElementWithThatClassName); I gotta re-query to get the new one, right?
[06:54:54] <Cork> it is a bit scary :)
[06:55:01] <seutje> yeah, that's the question
[06:55:18] <seutje> although "some" wasn't quite the answer I was hoping for
[06:55:23] <c4ptnh00k> I have an address form. The user can add more than one address. I have it so every time they click add it takes the form element and puts it in an array. How do you post this array through ajax?
[06:55:27] <seutje> just wondering if I can loop & remove safely
[06:55:31] <seutje> or if I need a proxy array
[06:55:35] <Cork> seutje: i actually think it does modify it self
[06:55:39] <seutje> fuck
[06:55:59] <Cork> getElement(s)By is the ones i remeber has that weird behavior
[06:56:03] <seutje> so my loop will effectively only remove half and trip out once it gets past half-way
[06:56:24] <Cork> try loop backwards
[06:56:30] <Cork> that usually fixes those problems
[06:56:38] <seutje> right, never think of that
[06:56:46] <seutje> usually end up with a derpy tempArr
[06:57:47] <noaXess> seutje: i got it,, can define start date ;)
[06:58:11] <Cork> i remember the getElement(s)By dynamic behavior from some examples back in the late 90's where you could end up in a loop cause the element you work with keeps jumping in the list
[06:58:13] <agbeladem> Hi guys, know any jquery plugin to do a graph like the one in the middle : http://bits.liquidx.net/projects/plotkit/plotkit-demo.jpg ?
[06:58:15] <Cork> so it never ends :D
[06:58:49] <Cork> agbeladem: should be a long list of plugins that can do that
[06:58:50] <seutje> I hate shit that morphs what ur dealing with instead of returning the altered state
[06:58:50] <Tingle> Hi, I'm wanting to submit a form over js so I'm catching the form through $('body div.login_form form').on('submit', function(data)
[06:59:02] <Cork> agbeladem: both in svg and canvas
[06:59:08] <seutje> hell, core could do that :P
[06:59:18] <agbeladem> Cork: you know how they're called ? Like, cumulative line plots ?
[06:59:24] <Tingle> a alert tells me that the data variable is a Object object, how can I look at what it is?
[06:59:27] <seutje> Tingle: the argument to the handler is the event
[06:59:37] <agbeladem> Cork: I can't find it in JqPlot, for instance
[06:59:49] <seutje> Tingle: if it was triggered with data, try event.data (after changing data to event in the argument)
[06:59:53] <Cork> agbeladem: have a look at flot or g.raphael for two examples
[07:00:14] <Tingle> oh ok ill try
[07:00:14] <agbeladem> Cork: raphael isn't jquery though is it
[07:00:15] <seutje> Tingle: if you're trying to get at the actual form values, just $(this).serialize() in the handler
[07:00:38] <seutje> vanilla JS is like a dirty word nowadays
[07:00:44] <Cork> agbeladem: it is a svg compatibility lib, but it works nicely with jquery
[07:00:57] <Tingle> Im wanting a array so I can pass it through ajax
[07:01:00] <Cork> or rather svg/vml compatibility
[07:01:10] <agbeladem> hmmm… perhaps
[07:01:22] <Cork> ?g raphael graphs
[07:01:22] <b-ot> Cork: gRaphaël—Charting JavaScript Library → http://g.raphaeljs.com/
[07:02:27] <Tingle> ah ok, serialize did it
[07:02:39] <Tingle> is there some function that convets that to an array?
[07:02:46] <seutje> Cork: just realized this element I'm after is always alone, so I'me just stick an ID on it and getElementById instead :)
[07:02:48] <Cork> Tingle: that problem comes from you using alert() for debugging
[07:02:55] <Cork> Tingle: use console.log() instead
[07:03:11] <Tingle> ok
[07:03:54] <seutje> Tingle: oh, want an array? use serializeArray instead: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:04:11] <Cork> seutje: i think the problem was the output
[07:04:47] <Cork> unless i misunderstood the question completely
[07:04:53] <Tingle> nice thanks
[07:04:55] <Tingle> console log is awsome
[07:04:58] <seutje> agbeladem: d3 is also a nice library for rendering dynamic, interactive graphs
[07:05:01] <Tingle> I can browse a object
[07:05:03] <Tingle> at least in ff
[07:05:04] <seutje> not jquery though
[07:05:15] <someone235> hi, I try to get to the text of a big element, and change its html. e.g, change <a><b></i>hello</i></b></a> to <a><b></i><u>hello</u></i></b></a>. is it possible?
[07:06:45] <Cork> someone235: yes $('i').each(function() { $(this).html($('<u>').html($(this).html())) })
[07:07:21] <agbeladem> Cork: I don't really see that kind of plot in gRafael line charts
[07:07:50] <Cork> agbeladem: http://g.raphaeljs.com/linechart.html
[07:07:57] <Cork> top right
[07:08:26] <Cork> Someguy123: actually $('i').wrapInner('<u>') should work too
[07:09:27] <Tingle> and is there a function with jquery to take that array and format it into a json string?
[07:09:47] <Tingle> i found this JSON.stringify, but that isnt jquery
[07:09:57] <Cork> JSON.stringify()
[07:10:01] <Cork> (not in jquery though)
[07:10:39] <Tingle> ok then ill just use that
[07:17:23] <Tingle> mm short question, I'm using this http://www.openwall.com/phpass/, to hash my passwords, I think It would be best to send a hash to the server instead of the raw password, does this framework exist for javascript? I can only find it for php
[07:18:10] <NoiseEee> Tingle: just use ssl to send to the server
[07:18:51] <Tingle> well I do have a ssl connection.. but what if I didn't
[07:19:12] <NoiseEee> then it would be ill advised to even send a hash over a non-ssl connection.
[07:19:46] <ravenzz> Cork seems to be working now, anything you would change http://jsfiddle.net/YXSwE/ ? (take in mind that it is a testcase yet)
[07:19:50] <NoiseEee> Tingle: feel free to look at https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/ or http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/ but there's no blowfish, the only real decent one is PBKDF2
[07:20:01] <NoiseEee> Tingle: but again, its about SSL.
[07:20:26] <Tingle> what do you mean its about ssl?
[07:20:50] <NoiseEee> Tingle: that's the single point of focus for sending anything secure from client to server, encrypted or not
[07:21:13] <Cork> Tingle: there is little point in hashing the password before it is sent to the server
[07:21:23] <Tingle> why?
[07:21:36] <Cork> Tingle: cause that would just make the hash the password instead of what you enter
[07:21:51] <Cork> Tingle: the hasing solutions is for storing the password in a safe way
[07:21:54] <Cork> not transmitting it
[07:22:31] <Cork> Tingle: cause if the stored hash is leaked, it is much harder to get the working password from that
[07:22:50] <Cork> Tingle: but if you hash it before it is submitted, it basically means you store the password used
[07:22:57] <Tingle> if the client has a trojan or some kind of sniffer that reads out packets coming from that network, or someone installs some kind of sniffer node infront of the server, catching the data going from client to server - then they would get the raw password from the user
[07:23:20] <Cork> Tingle: they would still have to decrypt the ssl connection
[07:23:29] <Tingle> yeah but Im saying if I didnt have ssl
[07:23:37] <Cork> Tingle: or they could hijack the browser, and then neither would matter
[07:23:48] <Tingle> many websites, like forums and other places dont use ssl
[07:24:02] <Cork> Tingle: you can't replace ssl with hashing
[07:24:02] <Tingle> do they just raw send the password to the server?
[07:24:09] <NoiseEee> Tingle: then i'd stay away from those
[07:24:11] <Cork> no they are just insecure
[07:24:15] <NoiseEee> Tingle: probably, you could see yourself
[07:24:19] <Cork> you can't make it safe without an ssl connection
[07:24:36] <Cork> Tingle: an none ssl connection can be highjacked in seconds if anyone wants to
[07:24:44] <Cork> Tingle: they don't even need the password
[07:24:56] <Tingle> mm then how do forums do it
[07:24:57] <Cork> Tingle: all they need is one packet from you, to get the session id
[07:25:02] <Cork> and then bam they have access
[07:25:14] <Cork> Tingle: either they don't give a ***, or they user ssl
[07:25:29] <AdamPDotty> mostly first :-)
[07:25:33] <Cork> ya
[07:25:47] <Cork> *use
[07:25:55] <boytoy> With jQuery Embedly, how do I not embed data from random URLs (just show the anchors normally) - but only embed from YouTube and Vimeo? http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/31/edit
[07:25:58] <boytoy> I've been told to use the Services API (http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/service) so if someone could give me some quick guidance I'd appreciate it.
[07:26:28] <Tingle> mm k
[07:26:35] <Tingle> well you said I can see how they transfer data
[07:26:44] <Tingle> Im on this forum that isnt ssl secured
[07:26:46] <Tingle> atm
[07:26:54] <Tingle> how can I view what they do with my data
[07:26:58] <Tingle> when I login
[07:27:05] <Cork> Tingle: you can't
[07:27:23] <Cork> Tingle: but anyone that can connect to the network you are on, can just grab one packet from you
[07:27:30] <Cork> and from there get the session cookie id
[07:27:39] <NoiseEee> Tingle: one sec
[07:27:44] <Cork> and that is all that's needed to grab your session and do what ever they want as you
[07:27:46] <harryhcs> hey, how do you set headers for a xmlhttprequest ? All I see is the xhr.setRequestHeader("TVR-CLTPUBKEY", public_key), but would that mean I would have to do this for each header?
[07:27:56] <harryhcs> is there not a object type?

[07:28:34] * Cork hits b-ot
[07:28:47] <Cork> Tingle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep
[07:28:57] <Cork> take that and run it on a public wifi and have fun :)
[07:28:59] <Tingle> yeah I understand that non ssl isnt secure Cork, I just can't beleave this vBulletin board doesnt encode my password before sending it to the server.
[07:29:14] <NoiseEee> Tingle: in firefox, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tamper-data/ is super easy to use
[07:29:18] <Cork> Tingle: they don't cause that is pointless
[07:29:28] <NoiseEee> Tingle: believe it dude, the whole internet is practically insecure.
[07:29:40] <Cork> Tingle: if you encode the password before it is submitted, all the attacker needs is to grab the encrypted password
[07:29:46] <Cork> Tingle: then what have you gained?
[07:29:58] <Tingle> then he doesnt know the password
[07:30:00] <Cork> (or if you hash it it has the same effect)
[07:30:08] <Cork> Tingle: they don't need your password
[07:30:18] <Cork> they need your encoded password, cause that is what the server expects
[07:30:28] <Cork> Tingle: and that is why it is pointless
[07:30:47] <Cork> the network trafic will contain what the server expects, so as long as you can grab the packet and read it
[07:30:50] <Tingle> um, he can just take the password and login normaly over his browser, like the original user did, because he has the raw login darta
[07:30:51] <Cork> you have everything you need
[07:30:52] <Tingle> data*
[07:31:14] <Cork> Tingle: same would work if it was cryptated or hashed client side
[07:31:33] <Cork> only difference is he would have to cirkumvent the code that does it
[07:31:44] <Cork> so he can send the raw data he captured
[07:33:14] <Cronoh> Hi, I have multiple inputs that i am iterating over and I want to change their name from : question[0][1][123] to question[0][2][123] for example, what is the best way to do this?
[07:33:37] <Tingle> mm you dont understand what Im getting at, if I was to enter my data, login and pass, then someone catches that raw data, he can then login normaly over the site normaly with the 'real' data. but if that is encrypted, differnt than the hash the server is expecting, just a temporry encryption - then he cant login 'normaly' because that is not the data the login form takes normaly.
[07:34:04] <Cork> Cronoh: that would be string management, and spliting the string and changing the numbers
[07:34:16] <Cork> Tingle: i do, but you miss what matters
[07:34:16] <Tingle> so encrypting the login form data does make sence?
[07:34:16] <NoiseEee> Tingle: try re-reading the chat thus far.
[07:34:31] <Cork> Tingle: cause what matters is what is sent, not what is entered
[07:34:43] <NoiseEee> the server is EXPECTING the hash if thats what your plan is (sending a hash)
[07:34:47] <Tingle> exactly, so the sent data should not be the raw user data
[07:35:05] <Cork> Tingle: but it wouldn't matter cause the attacker would SEE THE HASH
[07:35:09] <Cork> and that is all he needs
[07:35:13] <NoiseEee> Tingle: whats the difference between sending "mypass" and encrypting "mypass" if the attacker can see both?!?!
[07:35:18] <Cork> he won't care about what you used to generate the hash
[07:36:02] <Tingle> no he wouldnt, I take 'mypass' turn it into 'sdfsdf' client side, send to server - the server unscrambles/decrpts it back to 'mypass', then hashes it and compares the hash to the db hash
[07:36:25] <NoiseEee> Tingle: good luck.
[07:36:27] <Tingle> I know sending a hash to the server would be useless
[07:36:38] <Tingle> considering that is what its expecting
[07:36:48] <Cork> Tingle: mypass > encode (sdfsdf) > network (sdfsdf) [hacker grabs (sdfsdf)] > server gets (sdfsdf) > decods (mypass)
[07:37:01] <Cork> Tingle: hacker sends (sdfsdf) > server gets (sdfsdf) > decods (mypass)
[07:37:07] <Cork> you added no protection what so ever
[07:37:07] <NoiseEee> Tingle: first of all, no passwords in a database should EVER have the possibility of being decrypted.
[07:37:19] <Tingle> ah
[07:37:21] <Tingle> now I get it cork
[07:37:39] <Tingle> yeah I suppose its useless then
[07:37:54] <Tingle> but at least he doesnt know the users real pw which that user might use on other places
[07:38:15] <NoiseEee> Tingle: which is what I just mentioned my last point.
[07:38:18] <Cork> Tingle: well you should never reuse passwords so...
[07:38:25] <NoiseEee> Tingle: first of all, no passwords in a database should EVER have the possibility of being decrypted.
[07:38:28] <Tingle> well users are not that smart ^^
[07:38:33] <Tingle> ppl use the same pw everywhere
[07:38:39] <Cork> ya, passwords should be hashed, not encrypted
[07:38:55] <Cork> but that should happen server side, not client side
[07:39:12] <Cork> else the hash in the database IS the password
[07:39:18] <Tingle> well anyway, gonna eat - thanks for hte insight on security >.>, I understand now
[07:39:30] <Cork> the hashing is to make the password the server expect be different from what is stored on the server
[07:39:51] <NoiseEee> tingle: also maybe give https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm a peek
[07:39:51] <Cork> (and impossible to extract from what is the database)
[07:40:08] <Tingle> also I just noticed encrpyting would be useless because the key used for the encrpytion is ofc in the javascript, so one could just decrypt it >.>
[07:40:24] <NoiseEee> Tingle: correct, encryption/decryption is not the proper way to store/compare passwords.
[07:40:38] <Tingle> so ssl & hash is the securest you get
[07:40:58] <Cork> you can double hash it
[07:41:07] <Cork> if you use ssl, that will give a small extra security
[07:41:17] <Cork> but not much
[07:42:22] <Tingle> so basicly the form sends 'mypass' to the server, the serve hashes it and compares it to the hash stored in the db
[07:42:30] <serapath> if i have lots of rows in a table and give each one an id like for example $('row-13')
[07:42:32] <NoiseEee> Tingle: bingo
[07:42:37] <Tingle> and mypass is unsecurly sent around the net
[07:42:50] <NoiseEee> Tingle: well no, it should be sent via SSL
[07:42:58] <Tingle> yeah ofc
[07:43:01] <Tingle> but if ssl isnt existant
[07:43:06] <Tingle> like on almost every forum
[07:43:14] <NoiseEee> Tingle: then again, its useless, there is no security on those forums
[07:43:42] <serapath> how can i select a row?
[07:43:50] <serapath> if i dont know how many rows are available?
[07:44:12] <serapath> is it possible to do something like $('#row-*').on('click'.... ?
[07:44:22] <NoiseEee> serapath: isn't a row a <tr> ?
[07:47:41] <serapath> mhh.. no actually a div
[07:48:25] <_rgn> technically you can do that but it might be smarter to add a class to all of them
[07:48:33] <_rgn> (not that exactly but something similar)
[07:50:51] <serapath> if i add a class to all of them
[07:51:05] <serapath> how could i make sure only the one i select triggers?
[07:51:17] <NoiseEee> serapath: thats the way javascript works?
[07:51:22] <serapath> hmm ok
[07:51:26] <_rgn> .on('click', makes sure of that
[07:52:00] <grafi> sounds like binding to a parent would be a better idea? if there are many "rows" ?
[07:53:25] <serapath> what means "binding to a parent"?
[07:54:47] <johnny_|_> Hi. With sortable tabs - how can I get old and new position of re-ordered tab?
[07:56:03] <grafi> serapath instead of binding your click handler to every row you bind to a parent e.g. a div that contains all of your "rows"
[08:00:26] <grafi> http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/events read about event bubbling and event delegation, its more of a general best practice than specific to solving your problem though
[08:00:50] <_rgn> grafi: that wouldn't have the desired effect if he just wants to act on a single row
[08:01:20] <dersand> is $().click(function(){}, function(){}); do-able? It does not seem to work for me
[08:01:47] <grafi> if he wanted to only select a single row he wouldnt try to bind to something like row-* in the first place though?
[08:01:55] <NoiseEee> dersand: what?
[08:02:06] <NoiseEee> dersand: what are you trying to do?
[08:02:14] <dersand> this: http://pastebin.com/jNppD11D
[08:02:30] <_rgn> grafi: why not?
[08:02:40] <dersand> I only get alert(1) on my screen
[08:02:55] <NoiseEee> dersand: no, bad syntax, you don't add two handlers.
[08:03:01] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[08:03:01] <grafi> because that selector will match multiple "rows" ?
[08:03:05] <NoiseEee> dersand: you can call an additional handler from the first
[08:03:13] <Bloomberg> Someone know some channel for video?
[08:03:29] <_rgn> grafi: that's what he wants to do, bind to each row and add a handler where element is the clicked row
[08:03:36] <dersand> Would it be too much to ask for a rewrite?
[08:04:00] <NoiseEee> http://pastebin.com/U4AvNqLD @ dersand
[08:04:17] <_rgn> it's the same as having class "foo" in each row and doing $('.foo').click
[08:05:05] <dersand> NoiseEee, the function that i wrote changes some css properties, however when i do it just like that i never get the new values
[08:05:11] <grafi> but that will still work on all rows with .foo, no?
[08:05:35] <Bloomberg> someone know how can I merge a subtitle with a pm4 movie?
[08:05:36] <NoiseEee> dersand: http://pastebin.com/Vi1N0jQu is really all thats needed
[08:05:37] <Bloomberg> mp4*
[08:05:58] <NoiseEee> dersand: well maybe jsFiddle an example of what's not working etc
[08:06:13] <_rgn> grafi: yeah but the event handlers are specific to the rows
[08:06:34] <dersand> The function gets called now, but the things i need to change does not.
[08:06:57] <grafi> not really
[08:07:02] <NoiseEee> dersand: well then maybe you need to pass nextImg to setLbProperties?
[08:10:39] <dersand> I solved it, why couldn't i use the callbacks like that?
[08:12:54] <NoiseEee> dersand: you only get one callback.  you can look into promises to manage a bunch.
[08:13:03] <Tingle> how do I retrieve the 'data' string I sent over ajax to a php?
[08:14:06] <dersand> $_POST['name']
[08:14:10] <dersand> or GET
[08:14:17] <Tingle> what name
[08:14:23] <Tingle> i never specified a name
[08:14:34] <dersand> if you send data{hello:hello}
[08:14:37] <dersand> sent*
[08:14:47] <Tingle> I sent: data: JSON.stringify($(this).serializeArray()),
[08:15:00] <Tingle> or is that formating wrong
[08:15:07] <Tingle> the doc said just a plain string
[08:15:33] <dersand> Either way you send it, you get it as $_GET[''] or $_POST[''];
[08:15:57] <Tingle> hmm ok
[08:16:07] <Tingle> well print_r($GET); and print_r($POST); are empty
[08:16:16] <dersand> use var_dump();
[08:16:36] <BlakeH> Guys, where do i place $(document).ajaxError  ?? should it be outside of the document.ready or inside?
[08:16:39] <dersand> pastebin your code
[08:17:30] <dersand> Tingle, have you specified your code for which way to send it?
[08:17:41] <dersand> e.g type: GET or type: POST
[08:18:21] <dersand> And also, use var_dump[$_GET not $GET
[08:18:28] <Tingle> ah
[08:18:30] <Tingle> ups
[08:19:40] <Tingle> mm array(0) on both get and post
[08:19:44] <Tingle> let me show you my code
[08:19:51] <dersand> sure
[08:20:34] <Tingle> http://hastebin.com/hesaqikali.php
[08:21:30] <OnkelTem> Would you recommend plugings showcase/store with modern image sliders?
[08:21:30] <Tingle> and the $(this).serializeArray() comes from a submit form, but that data is valid, ive printed it out
[08:22:17] <dersand> var_dump shows nothing?
[08:23:07] <Tingle> i get "array(0){}" in the console, for both GET and POST
[08:23:59] <Tingle> ah
[08:24:00] <Tingle> its in GET
[08:24:10] <Tingle> and I needed to not use the stringify
[08:24:21] <Tingle> so just plain data: $(this).serializeArray(),
[08:24:26] <Tingle> now it works
[08:24:58] <dersand> i could have tried http://pastebin.com/b3zKU5vp
[08:25:02] <BlakeH> Anyone?
[08:25:13] <dersand> yeah?
[08:25:35] <BlakeH> $(document).ajaxError(..  inside or outside of the document.ready?
[08:25:45] <dersand> try it?
[08:27:57] <Smaug> Hey guys,,, I am new to jquery
[08:28:02] <Smaug> and need help!!
[08:30:16] <Smaug> if i am using jquery to develop a web site,, what should i use to get data from database?
[08:30:23] <Tingle> btw, are require_once paths, relative to the root or the folder of the file calling require_once?
[08:34:50] <slikts> Smaug: your question is too broad and suggests you are too noob
[08:35:34] <Smaug> yah,, i just started learning jquery
[08:36:11] <slikts> it does't even have anything to do with jquery, you need to learn basic general concepts like what's ajax
[08:39:12] <_rgn> Smaug: jQuery.get or jQuery.ajax, read the documentation
[08:50:15] <spobat> hi
[08:50:24] <spobat> why aren't these .show()s not animated? http://jsfiddle.net/esBPa/
[08:51:23] <spobat> well they are animated, but it looks weird http://jsfiddle.net/esBPa/1/
[08:57:54] <defaultro> anyone here uses select2 plugin?
[09:00:19] <spobat> is it possible to center block tags? http://jsfiddle.net/esBPa/2/
[09:02:48] <boredcodemonkey1> Is there any way to access the contents of a included script from a different domain?
[09:03:26] <boredcodemonkey1> Or will the same origion policy still stop me?
[09:03:47] <boredcodemonkey1> origin
[09:05:47] <boredcodemonkey1> I am trying to just cat the included file if that is possible.
[09:28:02] <Smaug> can anyone tell me what other technology is required to develop a full-fledged website
[09:28:14] <Smaug> with jquery
[09:29:03] <tw2113> html/css ?
[09:29:09] <tw2113> a browser
[09:29:17] <tw2113> your favorite version control?
[09:29:52] <Smaug> yah,, do we need wcf or C#.net or asp.net ? like when we want to fetch data from backend
[09:31:08] <InphraRed> how do I get jquery code within content loaded via .load() to work?  It seems only some javascript is parsed in the content loaded.
[09:31:10] <tw2113> even in 2013, a website can be powered simply by html/css/js
[09:31:21] <tw2113> server side languages aren't a requirement
[09:31:47] <InphraRed> tw2113 there's a lot that server side languages are best fro, like sessions for one.
[09:31:57] <Smaug> js can be used to get data from sql server?
[09:31:59] <tw2113> yes, there are perks to them
[09:32:43] <tw2113> ajax can fetch data from the server, but unless there's stuff i don't know(plenty), then it's not a bad idea for a server side language to intercept your sql request and return the data
[09:32:49] <tw2113> not sure about directly to the sql tables
[09:33:21] <Smaug> i have to get data from sql server,,
[09:33:32] <InphraRed> tw2113 if there's one reason to not use IIS as a webserver, is the fact ASP does not by default, or in any easy manner, do server side session handling, it's all javascript based cookie session tracking.  Which may shed light to how often IIS based sites are often hacked.
[09:33:49] <tw2113> i avoid Microsoft's products as much as i can anyway
[09:34:23] <scar> office isn't too bad. i don't pay for it tho. got a 365 subscription thru the office. allows for a home install
[09:34:24] <InphraRed> tw2113 unfortunately, I have to code up a site+backend for a client who happens to be running Windows 2003 and Windows 2008R2 and IIS.  It sucks balls.
[09:34:24] <scar> ;)
[09:34:34] <scar> InphraRed, eew :\
[09:34:40] <tw2113> i just use libreoffice scar
[09:34:50] <InphraRed> libreoffice is nice
[09:35:33] <Smaug> while learning get method,, they used aspx and wcf page in the url parameter
[09:35:33] <InphraRed> but libreoffice will always "suck" for as long as it can't render, pixel for pixel stuff from MS Office.
[09:36:01] <InphraRed> Office is the only reason Windows maintains a hold on desktops in the office.
[09:37:21] <InphraRed> I've ran into too many people who pass judgement on koffice/libreoffice/google+docs by comparison to MS Office and not by merits of the software itself.
[09:37:46] <InphraRed> koffice is actually pretty bad ass, especially for rendering complicated math equations
[09:39:41] <Smaug> just one question:: please tell me how to fetch data from database using jquery?
[09:39:58] <Smaug> do we need to use ado.net for this? or jquery can do that?
[09:40:42] <InphraRed> Smaug problem with that, is how is it going to know how to talk to the SQL database?  They aren't all created equal, at some point you'll need a database connector.
[09:41:02] <InphraRed> MSSQL, PostgresSQL, MySQL, Oracle....
[09:41:08] <InphraRed> IBM DB
[09:41:23] <Smaug> by database connector , u mean to say ADO.net, right?
[09:41:23] <InphraRed> Javascript has no drivers to talk to all of those.
[09:42:01] <Smaug> yes, /inphrared
[09:42:50] <jop008> Is there a clever way to sort date in an array?
[09:43:10] <Smaug> how is aspx page who will get data from database using ADO.net will send data to jquery? so that i can apply that data to some attribute value?
[09:43:29] <InphraRed> Smaug I'm actually doing just that
[09:43:31] <InphraRed> one sec
[09:43:33] <jop008> I want to find out if there are holes in my days. All days must be within one period
[09:44:11] <InphraRed> I'm using System.Data.SqlClient in aspx C#
[09:44:21] <InphraRed> It can only talk to MSSQL though
[09:44:41] <xdjuj__> Damned
[09:44:45] <xdjuj__> What a bad word...
[09:44:47] <xdjuj__> C#...
[09:44:52] <xdjuj__> Uggly °_0
[09:45:17] <InphraRed> SqlConnection data class
[09:45:28] <InphraRed> xdjuj__ yeah, but it's better than vb I think.
[09:45:31] <Smaug> InphraRed yes,,I know that in ASP.NET
[09:46:27] <Smaug> #inphrared
[09:46:39] <Smaug> how to tag a name in the chat :O'
[09:47:05] <xdjuj__> InphraRed Maybe :) But that's from the wrong side of the Force :p
[09:48:17] <fonko> guys does anybody used this countdown plugin before? http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html

[10:21:58] <serapath> hi, i use jade templating language. for many pages i have a dynamically created html site + a related css file + a related js file, sometimes i have additional stuff and i'd like to put it all in the same folder
[10:22:33] <serapath> how would i do that? ...because the jade template is rendered by the server and thats why i havent put that file inside of my publicly shared folder, like the html or css files
[10:54:50] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js

[11:27:35] <guzzlefry> oh, $(parent)? :P
[11:29:32] <jsc802> how come this doesnt work
[11:29:35] <jsc802>     $(this).parent.find('a.test').show();

[11:42:58] <Tingle> how do you disable/greyout a sumbit button showing it is disabled/working?
[11:44:57] <NoiseEee> Tingle: theButton.prop('disabled',true);
[11:45:47] <Tingle> ah

[11:45:49] <Tingle> ok thanks
[11:46:28] <NoiseEee> yw
[12:01:06] <clarkk> I'm having a mental block. I didn't have a problem with this before, and the elements were being selected correctly, but now it is returning zero elements. Can anyone spot anything wrong with this?  console.log("No of rows = " + $('.myclass').length);
[12:01:45] <Kambfhase> clarkk: looks fine.
[12:02:34] <granjero> hi, can anyone give me a hand with a jquery menu called superfish?? i can not make the dropdown menu to work
[12:03:38] <clarkk> thanks Kambfhase - damn this is crazy :(
[12:04:40] <Kambfhase> Are you sure there is an element with .myclass in the DOM?
[12:06:10] <clarkk> Kambfhase: yes. Sorry, I have to pop out. Will return later to troubleshoot it. Thanks for your responses
[12:06:28] <Kambfhase> np
[12:07:53] <guzzlefry> so uh
[12:08:09] <scar> uh uh
[12:08:16] <guzzlefry> $("#backgroundMusic").get(0);
[12:08:26] <guzzlefry> TypeError: $(...).get is not a function
[12:08:41] <guzzlefry> Note that $("#backgroudnMusic"); actually finds an element.
[12:12:15] <guzzlefry> Any ideas?
[12:14:11] <guzzlefry> okay, something is botched.
[12:14:58] <guzzlefry> It's selecting elements but none of the functions seem to exist.
[12:18:23] <Kambfhase> guzzlefry: looks like $ is not jQuery
[12:18:44] <Kambfhase> guzzlefry: check if $ == jQuery is true
[12:19:16] <guzzlefry> ah, stupid template language wasn't including the script. :P
[12:26:53] <zackiv31> is there something within all jQuery objects that is unique?  i.e. can I query something on the object that is always the same, and is always unique from other objects?  or do I have to maintain this myself

[12:32:57] <chuwiey> Hi, I'm running into a problem with 1.10.2 and the sourcemap, when using jquery from bower...
[12:33:41] <chuwiey> Basically, the jquery.min.map that gets installed with bower is looking for jquery-1.10.2.js, however, bower installs a jquery.js file
[12:36:21] <chuwiey> So I wanted to create a pull request to fix that, however, when I checked out 1.x-master, I encountered three problems: 1) I'm not sure if that's the right branch to go off of. 2) I tried to build using grunt, but that's failing based on a missing src file from sizzle. 3) I saw that jquery 2.x says in the release.js file that the jquery.js file is defined, but is commented out due to backwards compatability with 1.x
[12:36:25] <Gmac_> how can i easily figure out what code is causing an element to have inline styling of dimply none
[12:36:40] <chuwiey> can anyone point me in the right direction so i can branch this and fix?
[12:36:46] <chuwiey> or maybe i'm doing it wrong :-)
[12:42:44] <virgomoon> In this call " $("div").load( <URL>, function { $("div").trigger("create"); } "  just as an example .. does the callback function run asynchronously?  i.e. is it possible that it runs after whatever comes after that 'load' function line?
[12:45:11] <NoiseEee> virgomoon: no, the callback would fire after the xhr response is returned.
[12:46:50] <virgomoon> so, for example .. $("div").load( <URL>, function { $("div").trigger("create"); } ); alert ("done");  the alert could fire before the create trigger would, right?
[12:47:05] <NoiseEee> virgomoon: yes, it likely would fire before then.
[12:47:21] <virgomoon> that would explain my headache today
[12:47:21] <virgomoon> ty

[13:19:50] <serapath> hi, i could need some help. i'm using http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager and have a working tag manager on my site, but i try to add another instance, and it tells me that .tagManger() method called on my DOM element, does not exist
[13:20:01] <serapath> i dont understand why thats the case, because it works with the first on
[13:20:03] <serapath> one
[13:21:27] <talntid> serapath, when using multiple instances of tag manager on a page, each input field must have a unique name, not just a unique ID. This behavior will be improved in v3.0
[13:23:12] <serapath> thats what i did
[13:23:35] <talntid> alright
[13:23:42] <talntid> you may want to make a jsfiddle for more help
[13:23:43] <serapath> i'm adding the second tag manager 'later on'
[13:23:45] <serapath> dynamically
[13:23:51] <serapath> is that a problem?
[13:24:14] <talntid> i don't see why, but anything is guessing unless you can show an actual example
[13:24:28] <serapath> could i instead link you to the live project?
[13:24:41] <serapath> because creating a fiddle isnt trivial
[13:28:58] <grafi> show the project
[13:32:59] <nooneelse> Hi guys, why when I use this "jQuery.post('/gpli/businesscase/cadastros/validaPasso1', serializedData).done(function(data) { var respObj = JSON.parse(data)
[13:33:00] <nooneelse> console.log(respObj.busi_nome)
[13:33:00] <nooneelse> 	}) " it only works once, then, it doesn't send anymore the POST data, causing a 500 error on the serve
[13:33:19] <nooneelse> does anyone know why ?
[13:41:16] <bluesm_> What is the source of the "data" method
[13:41:29] <bluesm_> I mean that it is the "data-" properties from html
[13:41:59] <bluesm_> but what else ? Since if you set the "data" property via jQuery
[13:42:12] <bluesm_> it won't show up in the html code
[13:42:35] <bluesm_> so it is not synonimic to "set attribute"
[13:45:38] <ngharo> perhaps it's using element.dataset
[13:45:57] <ngharo> where supported
[13:47:24] <bluesm_> dataset source is from html "data-" but it is not written to html
[13:47:33] <bluesm_> When set by JavaScript right ?
[13:50:02] <bluesm_> ngharo: ^
[13:50:18] <ngharo> i just tested, it does indeed get written to html
[13:50:37] <ngharo> also jquery data() cannot be found in element.dataset
[13:51:32] <bluesm_> ngharo: So jquery uses something else when you write something with "data" ?
[13:53:29] <ngharo> i dont know enough about the internals to answer that
[13:53:54] <EHLOVader> evening everyone.. had a bug I was hoping to get some advice on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13428
[13:54:36] <EHLOVader> it has been 7 months, the workaround provided by dmethvin doesn't work for me because I can't have the focus event run again
[13:55:35] <EHLOVader> I was trying to accomplish a focus without firing the event (the opposite of triggerHandler, which is event firing without the focus)
[13:56:49] <EHLOVader> I started with off('focus').focus().on('focus', function(){...}) and that worked perfectly in chrome, but IE fired focus handler on that focus even though it shouldn't have existed
[13:57:09] <EHLOVader> so then I went with http://stackoverflow.com/a/13078895/704765
[13:57:13] <nonotza> hey everyone. I'm having an issue with youtube videos playing not being able to play in full screen in Windows8 IE10. I believe the issue is caused because, with jQuery, I'm copying a div's contents, removing the original div (which includes the youtube embedded iframe), and then using jQuery.after() to paste the copied div's contents into another area of the website. After I do this, the video shows up fine, but clicking on the full screen but
[13:57:14] <nonotza> resets the video.
[13:57:15] <EHLOVader> it would work if that bug wasn't a problem
[13:57:28] <nonotza> Does anyone have an idea of something i can do to perhaps mitigate the issue?
[13:58:29] <EHLOVader> any advice? tl;dr how to focus dom element without firing the event handler in jquery 1.9.0
[13:58:57] <nonotza> can't you just write a filter in the event handler?
[14:00:54] <EHLOVader> nonotza: a filter based on what exactly?
[14:01:20] <nonotza> the condition for which you don't want the event handler to handle the event
[14:01:24] <EHLOVader> I need to handle natural focus events, but also later need to manually focus the same element without firing the event
[14:01:47] <grafi> sounds strange
[14:01:48] <grafi> ...
[14:01:51] <EHLOVader> I want to fire the event when keyboard or clicks have focused it, but not when I programatically focused it
[14:02:29] <nonotza> can't you attach a property to the event e.g. ignore = true?
[14:02:30] <EHLOVader> I am using an anchor to serve as a tabindex for handson table... I suppose I could just tabindex its outer div but I would still likely run into the same problem
[14:02:47] <EHLOVader> nonotza: you mean in the extra parameters passed to the handler?
[14:02:53] <nonotza> yes
[14:02:56] <EHLOVader> I would but http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13428
[14:03:02] <EHLOVader> the very first thing... there is a bug
[14:03:11] <nonotza> oh
[14:03:29] <nonotza> use vanilla js then
[14:03:47] <EHLOVader> I also tried just using a variable in scope, one set before firing the event, and then unset in the handler and use that to determine it, but if I wildly tab through the form it seems to get confused and I run into a race condition
[14:04:04] <EHLOVader> vanilla js, how do you suppose?
[14:04:20] <EHLOVader> oh, is that a framework
[14:04:23] <EHLOVader> or library
[14:04:33] <nonotza> lol
[14:04:36] <EHLOVader> or do you mean 'vanilla' js
[14:04:40] <nonotza> vanilla js = javascript
[14:04:51] <EHLOVader> why would someone name their framework that
[14:05:07] <EHLOVader> that makes sense nonotza
[14:05:21] <tw2113> i've never fully gotten that term either
[14:05:24] <EHLOVader> I tried to access the dom to focus the element, but it is still firing the jquery event handler too
[14:05:26] <nonotza> :)
[14:05:54] <EHLOVader> I would like to not ditch jquery as I am using jquery ui too and all sorts of other plugins
[14:06:25] <EHLOVader> I would roll back to 1.8.3 but I am using features in jquery ui 10.3 which had upgraded to jquery 1.9
[14:06:34] <EHLOVader> so I am not sure if I can rollback without adding more testing and headaches
[14:09:39] <EHLOVader> I feel like I am missing something
[14:09:54] <EHLOVader> it shouldn't be this complicated... amiright?
[14:11:22] <EHLOVader> nonotza: thanks though, for taking a minute or two to look at it.
[14:11:50] <nonotza> well the simple solution is blocked by the bug
[14:11:56] <nonotza> so you are right it shouldn't be that complicated
[14:12:19] <nonotza> I still think you can use vanilla js to work with this particular event and use case
[14:12:28] <EHLOVader> yeah
[14:15:09] <EHLOVader> nah, nonotza....  I tried something similar to the workaround in the bug report
[14:15:10] <EHLOVader> http://i.imgur.com/sWGrhj4.png
[14:15:30] <nonotza> that's vanilla js :)
[14:15:31] <EHLOVader> and my handler runs twice...
[14:15:34] <EHLOVader> http://i.imgur.com/GIGeJ34.png
[14:15:48] <EHLOVader> what my handler must do is when the anchor is focused, it transfers focus to the handson...
[14:16:12] <nonotza> I'd implement the entire handler in javascript with no jquery
[14:16:28] <nonotza> you can still use query inside the handler
[14:16:35] <nonotza> but the handler itself would be using plain js
[14:16:38] <EHLOVader> then I handle tabs within the table (it is like an excel block embedded in the form) and when it hits the end or begining, it focuses the anchor again, and lets the tab flow through to focus the appropriate next tabindex
[14:20:13] <EHLOVader> well I think they are just gonna have to tab slower... this is a working solution nonotza http://i.imgur.com/syP20p5.png
[14:20:25] <nonotza> cool
[14:20:29] <EHLOVader> but it also sometimes doesn't focus the handsontable because the outbound hasn't been set yet
[14:20:38] <EHLOVader> when I tab back and forth over it
[14:22:57] <EHLOVader> oh I think that may have just been off by one
[14:24:52] <amh120> Hey can I get some input? I've got this file I downloaded and it has something called onload.js and I see something that says:  ('line-height',$new_size); - is there anyway I can do like line-height new size +1? or +10px or +1.5em or something?
[14:25:46] <clov3r> amh120: short answer is yes
[14:26:02] <amh120> clov3r: lol, so is the solution a long answer?
[14:26:20] <clov3r> well line-height is a ratio
[14:26:28] <amh120> a ratio to the font?
[14:26:30] <clov3r> unitless
[14:26:32] <clov3r> yep
[14:26:49] <clov3r> so you'll see font-size: 16px; line-height:1.6;
[14:26:51] <clov3r> for example
[14:27:05] <amh120> clov3r: well right now their having it 1/1 to the font, so if the font renders (responsively) 15px, then the line-height will be displaying at 15px  (or i guess 1.5)
[14:27:32] <amh120> clov3r: the problem with that is it just looks too smushed, i'd love it to be like 15px = 1.8 or something, just a little more spacing
[14:27:33] <clov3r> right
[14:27:38] <clov3r> yeah
[14:27:45] <clov3r> just set it to 1.8
[14:28:12] <clov3r> and you could do that in a number of ways... whether by doing $new_size *= 1.8;
[14:28:22] <amh120> clov3r: but what does that code look like? because it's set to be responsive, so if it says: $(path_).css('line-height',$new_size);
[14:28:44] <clov3r> $(path_).css('line-height',$new_size*1.8);
[14:28:51] <amh120> anh
[14:28:53] <amh120> ahh*
[14:29:00] <amh120> clov3r: let me try
[14:29:14] <clov3r> do or do not
[14:29:19] <clov3r> there is no try
[14:33:15] <amh120> clov3r: lol i'm TRYING to see if it wored is what i meant, I tried it but it's altering all my text...hmm
[14:33:30] <amh120> clov3r: so now i'm trying to figure out how to make it only affect p class
[14:45:01] <Trudko> guys I would like to use jquery tablesorter editable widget for editing rows (example) http://jsfiddle.net/8cg4f/432/ and I need some listener so I can update data on server not sure where to put it I am getting lost in the code -> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/js/widgets/widget-editable.js
[14:46:02] <anew> if i have two class names class = "this that" can i $(.that).(); ?
[14:51:43] <clov3r> amh120: $('p').css('line-height',$new_size*1.8);
[14:52:34] <clov3r> anew: almost; you can $('.that').nextMethod();
[15:05:40] <gandul> whats wrong in this code ? http://pastie.org/8272293

[15:44:59] <Connor> Hello.  I'm trying to add plupload to my application.  Looks like it requires v1.9.0, but, I'm still using 1.3.2 and not ready to upgrade the application.  How can I run this using 2 versions.. I know about noconflict.
[16:08:45] <blazedd> I'm getting an issue with using .on for a live event delegation. I want to have the event listen on a parent li element and have it click the a element as a child. The event is propagating and causing a repeating event fire, which gives me a max stack size error. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/pVX97/1/
[16:21:30] <rhizome> hi all. i'm trying to manage some keyboard handling, restricting some fields to a-z and backspace. since apparently 'keypress' doesn't hear backspaces i'm using 'keyup', but the visual feedback on this is a bit suboptimal due to the keyup delay. is there a better way? should i split a-z and special character handling between different handlers?
[16:22:57] <rhizome> p.s., that would be $(foo).on('keyup', ...)

[16:23:27] <anew> how do you undo preventdefault ?
[16:24:03] <anew> is that even possible or should i show/hide buttons
[16:24:14] <anew> like i have a preventdefault on a button, then submitting some ajax
[16:24:18] <anew> on return i want the button to function
[16:25:20] <rhizome> preventdefault or disabled?
[16:25:32] <anew> e.preventDefault();
[16:25:40] <anew> just click(...e.preventDefault(); ...
[16:25:46] <anew> then running ajax

[16:37:58] <civilordergone> http://pastie.org/8272502 i'm trying to grab custom meta-data from a div through jquery
[16:38:23] <civilordergone> it throws undefined
[16:39:17] <jaCen915> Hi all, i'm having an odd issue with attempting to cache a jquery object into a var…can't figure out why the var stops acting like a jquery object when referenced (e.g. using the show() method here https://gist.github.com/jasonsemko/6348008)
[16:40:54] <jaCen915> nm found it :)
[16:41:10] <pixelpimp> civilordergone: looks decent to me other than it should be data-startleft
[16:41:33] <civilordergone> thanks pixelpimp, i'll change it and see what it says.
[16:41:40] <pixelpimp> http://jsfiddle.net/D5veG/
[16:41:53] <pixelpimp> seems to work without (not that it shouldn't really, just that your markup wasn't valid)
[16:44:26] <civilordergone> thanks pixelpimp, yeah it works in jsfiddle but i don't know why it's being goofy
[16:44:58] <dogarrhea> jQuery-1.7.2  vs  jQuery-1.10.2
[16:45:01] <dogarrhea> which one is newer?
[16:45:19] <dogarrhea> this versioning convention is weird
[16:51:18] <civilordergone> pixelpimp, figured it out.  i had another div without that attribute :-x.  i need breaaak points
[16:56:15] <guzzlefry> Is there an event triggered when something like an iframe's src attribute changes?
[16:59:39] <pixelpimp> .load()
[17:08:07] <guzzlefry> ah wait sorry...
[17:08:55] <guzzlefry> The iframe's location is changing, but source remains the same in the parent. 0.o
[17:10:31] <pixelpimp> hmm... maybe it has to be changed from the parent?  could be some security thing
[17:10:39] <pixelpimp> not sure on the specifics
[18:48:36] <ekkis> afternoon everyone.  I'm doing something like: x = $("<" + tag + "/>", opts) and I'd expect x to contain a jquery object.  would I be wrong?
[18:51:53] <tw2113> if you're trying to select by tag, i don't think you need the <> stuff ekkis
[18:51:59] <tw2113> just the actual tag name
[18:52:21] <ekkis> tw2113: really? wow
[18:52:26] <ekkis> oh wait, I'm not selecting
[18:52:30] <ekkis> I'm creating a new tag
[19:03:17] <ekkis> tw2113: http://jsfiddle.net/2k7kb/
[19:03:40] <ekkis> see, the object returned looks like a page element, not a jquery object... wtf?
[19:04:51] <tw2113> *shrug*
[19:06:42] <virgomoon> Good evening, all!  Using jquery mobile, in a UIWebView on iPhone, the 'click' event isn't triggered with a 'touch click' like it is in a browser .. is there another event I should be binding to to detect clicks instead of click?  I've been googling for a while and haven't found an event list
[19:07:31] <shodan45> how do you tell jquery UI that jquery isn't available via "$", just "jQuery"?
[19:14:35] <doug65536> shodan45: are you calling jQuery.noConflict() ?
[19:18:13] <shodan45> doug65536: yep, and I've tried several variations of it
[19:19:01] * shodan45 grumbles about designers having no business programming
[19:19:04] <doug65536> shodan45: what leads you to believe that $ is causing a problem?
[19:20:03] <shodan45> doug65536: firebug says it's undefined. If I change everything to "jQuery", I get ".tabs() is not a function"
[19:20:06] <doug65536> shodan45: correctly written plugins don't depend on $, they only depend on jQuery. They pass jQuery in as a parameter
[19:20:33] <shodan45> doug65536: this is plain jquery UI, no plugins that I'm aware of
[19:20:57] <doug65536> shodan45: jquery ui IS a plugin itself
[19:21:11] <doug65536> you are including jquery before jquery-ui right?
[19:21:18] <shodan45> doug65536: sure
[19:22:39] <shodan45> this is a wordpress site that someone else did, so I don't know what they did
[19:23:08] <obert> looks correct? $('#foo').load('<img src="' + foo_var + '">'); ?
[19:25:26] <shodan45> and old versions too - jquery is 1.6.1, jquery ui is 1.8.12
[19:26:23] <duckgoose> obert what are you trying to accomplish
[19:26:49] <obert> duckgoose: load imgs into #foo
[19:27:07] <obert> where foo_var is == path/img.jpg
[19:27:23] <doug65536> shodan45: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/tpb8s/3/
[19:29:12] <duckgoose> .load is only going to fire if #foo loads a URI
[19:29:14] <doug65536> obert: no, if foo_var has & or other characters that are special in html, the html will end up invalid
[19:29:35] <doug65536> obert: also, load takes a url
[19:30:48] <duckgoose> if you're trying to fire something after #foo loads, you would do $("#foo").load(function () {   the_code   });
[19:31:22] <doug65536> duckgoose: foo won't "load", it is not an image or an iframe
[19:32:00] <duckgoose> if #foo is an element you want to put html into, do $("#foo").html("THE_HTML");
[19:32:09] <doug65536> obert: maybe something like this is what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/82EVm/7/
[19:32:28] <obert> i want to open an img into a div
[19:33:20] <duckgoose> $("div").html('<img src="'+foo_var+'">');
[19:33:21] <obert> .html seems to works
[19:33:39] <doug65536> obert: sure, but it may be invalid
[19:33:50] <duckgoose> if you want to add html to it without overwriting the html do .append or .prepend
[19:33:57] <doug65536> obert: depending on what is in foo_var
[19:34:15] <obert> foo_var == path/filename.jpg
[19:34:16] <duckgoose> I assume foo_var is an image uri
[19:34:50] <doug65536> duckgoose: uri's aren't always valid html
[19:36:02] <obert> like $('#foo').empty().append('<img src="' + big_img + '">'); ?
[19:36:03] <duckgoose> I don't know what you mean. if the image uri is invalid the image just aint gonna load
[19:36:16] <doug65536> duckgoose: I mean & characters are invalid
[19:36:56] <doug65536> http://placehold.it/200x200&text=Test       <-- not valid html, must be  http://placehold.it/200x200&amp;text=Test
[19:38:58] <obert> why .load() wont works?
[19:39:11] <doug65536> obert: because .load takes a url. read the documentation
[19:39:13] <duckgoose> .load is not meant to load html into anything
[19:39:17] <duckgoose> unless it is a uri
[19:39:17] <obert> oh
[19:39:26] <obert> didnt thought about that indeed heh
[19:40:00] <duckgoose> also read what doug65536 said about valid html
[19:40:54] <doug65536> obert: if you want it to be guaranteed to be correct, use $('#foo').append($('<img>').attr('src', foo_img))
[19:40:56] <duckgoose> I think you can use encodeURI() for that
[19:41:16] <obert> doug65536: you go too far:p
[19:42:07] <doug65536> obert: and if something might be in there already and you want to replace it, use $('#foo').empty().append($('<img>').attr('src', foo_img))
[19:42:34] <obert> doug65536: you need .empty() in any cases seems
[19:42:53] <obert> else it will print an img on every click
[19:43:06] <obert> yep that
[19:46:34] <shodan45> hmm, how about this: what's an easy way to test if jquery ui loaded ok? something like a list of plugins?
[19:50:30] <doug65536> shodan45: if (typeof jQuery.ui !== 'undefined')  { ... jquery ui is loaded ... }
[19:51:07] <doug65536> shodan45: did you look at the fiddle I sent you?
[19:51:54] <doug65536> shodan45: you are wasting time trying to find a problem where no problem exists. the problem is somewhere else if you are loading jquery and calling noConflict like my fiddle
[19:52:05] <shodan45> doug65536: yeah... it didn't have a ton of baddly written wordpress theme code all over, so it doesn't count ;)
[19:52:19] <doug65536> lol
[19:52:52] <doug65536> shodan45: can you give me a link? I'll investigate in debugger for you
[19:54:17] <Jinxed-> I'm just learning jquery and I can't figure out why my ball div isn't moving: http://jsfiddle.net/pAWZg/
[19:54:18] <shodan45> doug65536: I'm honestly afraid of linking it in public since wordpress is out of date
[19:54:19] <Jinxed-> Any ideas
[19:54:22] <Jinxed-> should be pretty simple
[19:54:36] <doug65536> shodan45: PM it to me with /msg doug65536 <link here>
[19:55:34] <doug65536> shodan45: if you want, I'm offering to spend my time on it. your choice
[19:56:34] <Jinxed-> the stupid ball doesn't move
[19:56:42] <shodan45> doug65536: 1 sec, think I figured it out :)
[19:56:49] <doug65536> Jinxed-: it's a css problem: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pAWZg/3/
[19:57:04] <doug65536> Jinxed-: added position: relative to MyWorld and ball
[19:57:14] <Jinxed-> genius
[19:57:25] <doug65536> Jinxed-: there is another problem though
[19:57:36] <shodan45> nope.... very weird, jQuery.ui exists but none of the .tabs, .accordian, etc are there
[19:57:43] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you should start the next animation in the animation completion callback
[19:58:01] <doug65536> Jinxed-: the way it is, the anumation queue will gradually build up with queued anumations
[19:58:19] <Jinxed-> that was the only way I knew of creating a "delay"
[19:58:30] <Jinxed-> I know it just is an endless recursive loop
[19:58:32] <Jinxed-> which is awful
[19:58:37] <Jinxed-> but I couldn't figure out how to avoid it
[19:59:44] <doug65536> Jinxed-: animate takes a callback function that is called when the animation is finished... one moment, I'll update fiddle
[19:59:52] <Jinxed-> awesome
[20:00:17] <obert> thanks people
[20:00:43] <shodan45> I may just go burn down this "design" company's building instead of fixing this.... much more satisfying
[20:01:13] <doug65536> shodan45: jquery ui is never loaded - which is obvious - I mean, it doesn't even attempt to load it. where is that line supposed to be?
[20:03:46] <Jinxed-> doug65536: interesting... i thought .position() was suppose to give relative to the parent container... but I just get 0,0
[20:04:02] <shodan45> doug65536: hm? it's in there twice - lines 116 & 185
[20:04:15] <shodan45> twice because I'm debugging :)
[20:05:54] <doug65536> Jinxed-: this does what your code said, but probably not exactly what you want http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pAWZg/5/
[20:06:41] <doug65536> Jinxed-: it keeps stopping because the default easing function is 'swing'
[20:09:23] <doug65536> shodan45: core probably doesn't have tabs
[20:09:30] <doug65536> shodan45: why not include whole jquery-ui
[20:10:08] <doug65536> shodan45: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js
[20:10:29] <Jinxed-> doug65536: function myloop(){ $("#ball").animate({top: '+=10px'+},1000,myloop));
[20:10:31] <doug65536> shodan45: and don't include it twice - you're asking for problems
[20:10:41] <Jinxed-> doug65536: function myloop(){ $("#ball").animate({top: '+=10px'+},1000,myloop());
[20:11:29] <shodan45> doug65536: yeah, that was just out of frustration
[20:12:25] <doug65536> Jinxed-: I'm taking a wild guess that this is more like what you wanted  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pAWZg/9/
[20:13:53] <doug65536> Jinxed-: keep in mind that animate returns immediately, long before the animation is finished.
[20:14:09] <Jinxed-> yeah
[20:14:11] <doug65536> Jinxed-: actually, it returns before the animation starts :)
[20:14:14] <Jinxed-> javascript is weird
[20:14:27] <Jinxed-> comming from c++
[20:14:32] <Jinxed-> lots of things are much easier
[20:14:35] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you mean javascript is good. you want it to hang while it animates?
[20:14:51] <Jinxed-> doug65536: I'm just messing around trying to learn
[20:15:02] <Jinxed-> no "real"goal other than better understanding
[20:15:18] <doug65536> Jinxed-: get used to the async stuff and you will love it
[20:15:19] <Jinxed-> I figured making a ball bounce would be a good start
[20:15:32] <duckgoose> hmm stale cookies
[20:15:35] <Jinxed-> doug65536: it my my draft generator alot harder than I was expecting
[20:15:43] <Jinxed-> (draft generator was my first project)
[20:17:35] <doug65536> shodan45: are you including the jquery ui css?
[20:18:10] <shodan45> doug65536: not yet, I realized that was missing
[20:18:13] <doug65536> shodan45: for example http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[20:18:19] <shodan45> but no console errors! \o/
[20:21:03] <shodan45> doug65536: I have *something* finally.... thank you :)
[20:21:18] <shodan45> @doug65536++
[20:21:29] <shodan45> karma bot here? ;)
[20:24:23] <Jinxed-> doug65536: why does it always say yPos is 0?
[20:24:32] <Jinxed-> I changed it to go up and down instead of left/right
[20:36:04] <doug65536> Jinxed-: because you never change ball.yPos
[20:36:36] <doug65536> Jinxed-: that variable is not magically updated when the actual DOM element top changes
[20:37:25] <Jinxed-> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[20:37:36] <Jinxed-> doug65536: I read it as getting the position of the element relative to the parent
[20:37:45] <Jinxed-> in thsi case ball
[20:37:51] <doug65536> Jinxed-: yeah, so what? you only call it when page loads
[20:38:18] <Jinxed-> ah
[20:38:33] <doug65536> Jinxed-: it is zero at that moment
[20:39:14] <doug65536> put top: 20px in #ball in css and see what happens
[20:40:15] <Jinxed-> I call it now in the loop
[20:40:19] <doug65536> Jinxed-: I am basing my comments on the last fiddle I sent so it might not be in sync with what you have right now
[20:40:29] <Jinxed-> here is my current fiddle
[20:40:30] <Jinxed-> http://jsfiddle.net/pAWZg/10/
[20:41:05] <Jinxed-> opps
[20:41:08] <Jinxed-> wrong address
[20:41:08] <doug65536> Jinxed-: your code has syntax error
[20:41:10] <Jinxed-> 1 sec
[20:41:34] <doug65536> Jinxed-: the infamous missing );  :D
[20:41:40] <Jinxed-> http://jsfiddle.net/pAWZg/11/
[20:42:33] <doug65536> Jinxed-: orgball?
[20:42:41] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you are console.logging something else
[20:44:00] <Jinxed-> doug65536: ahh should be: console.log("yPos" + orgBall.yPos);
[20:44:11] <Jinxed-> but even after that I get yPosundefined
[20:44:27] <doug65536> Jinxed-: because position returns an object with 'top' and 'left'
[20:45:12] <Jinxed-> doug65536: ahh
[20:45:18] <Jinxed-> i'm getting sloppy/tired
[20:45:23] <Jinxed-> my mistake
[20:45:49] <Jinxed-> http://jsfiddle.net/pAWZg/13/ logs correctly now
[20:46:00] <Jinxed-> now I just need to get the up distance to equal the down distance
[20:46:14] <doug65536> Jinxed-: when you are not used to it, everything is unsure. once you get accustomed things like that will be instant fixed
[20:47:19] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you should do actual physics and handle the animation yourself
[20:47:59] <Jinxed-> well I'm doing the same form of the physics equation
[20:48:05] <Jinxed-> just not for earth
[20:48:09] <Jinxed-> gravity
[20:48:16] <doug65536> Jinxed-: yes but the velocity is capped by .animate
[20:48:36] <doug65536> Jinxed-: where to I put the coefficient of restitution in the fiddle? :D
[20:48:55] <Jinxed-> true it won't be correct exactly, but what I can do eventually is shorten the animate time
[20:49:02] <Jinxed-> increase the number of loops
[20:49:11] <doug65536> Jinxed-: yes, I know you're keeping it simple right now. I was joking
[20:49:16] <Jinxed-> so its updated every 1/100th of a second
[20:49:30] <Jinxed-> well i'm planning on doing physics eventually
[20:49:36] <Jinxed-> this is my hello world for animation
[20:49:42] <doug65536> 100th is way too excessive. almost all monitors only update 60 fps or less
[20:50:01] <doug65536> there is a "proper" way to do animation: window.requestAnimationFrame
[20:50:01] <Jinxed-> I think I will need to use jquery ui
[20:50:16] <Jinxed-> so I can set x and y coordinates exactly
[20:50:27] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you don't need jquery ui
[20:50:36] <doug65536> use .css({top: y, left: x})
[20:50:42] <Jinxed-> although I feel like jquery/html isn't really meant for this level of animation
[20:51:09] <doug65536> Jinxed-:  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/
[20:51:10] <Jinxed-> I mean obviously my simple example is alright, but as I expand it etc
[20:51:32] <anjaly> Hai all,In my jquery mobile ios phonegap application, i use iscroll. On using iscroll, text boxes behave weirdly (move up and down on entering each character).  I enabled iscroll in my app by,using data-iscroll in the content div, data-tap-toggle="false" data-transition="none" in header for making header fixed.scrolling occures but when i start typing in the textfield  the element does not keep a position .its running on the screen..
[20:52:04] <anjaly> is?
[20:52:29] <Jinxed-> doug65536: very cool, but kind of to my point that was quite a bit of work
[20:52:48] <Jinxed-> where you could get the same effect with some simple keyframing in flash
[20:52:56] <doug65536> Jinxed-: yes but you are saying moving a ball is too much for html and I pointed you to full 3D animation
[20:53:18] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you can keyframe css
[20:53:29] <Jinxed-> doug65536: sorry i didn't mean that jquery couldn't handle it, but just that it wasn't probably the ideal tool for the job
[20:53:29] <doug65536> Jinxed-: flash is dead :D
[20:53:52] <Jinxed-> well i'm attemping to learn some web language stuff
[20:53:56] <doug65536> Jinxed-: which is a good thing - why do they get a monopoly on websites
[20:54:27] <Jinxed-> doug65536: well I still think it has its uses
[20:54:33] <Jinxed-> We use sharepoint at work
[20:54:35] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you are way off imho. moving things around is *nothing* for a browser
[20:54:36] <Jinxed-> which is awful
[20:55:05] <Jinxed-> and I can either embed avi's which require directX and IE or I can do flash
[20:55:13] <Jinxed-> for video
[20:55:24] <doug65536> you can use html5 video
[20:55:34] <Jinxed-> not with sharepoint (as far as I know)
[20:56:06] <doug65536> Jinxed-: you can't put whatever html you like in the page?
[20:56:14] <Jinxed-> haha I wish
[20:56:32] <doug65536> Jinxed-: well, blame the people who make you use sharepoint
[20:56:40] <Jinxed-> oh I do
[20:56:42] <Jinxed-> everyday
[20:56:48] <Jinxed-> :)
[20:56:54] <doug65536> explain how you can put flash in the page then
[20:57:30] <Jinxed-> flash is the worst... causes my browser to crash like 25x a day
[20:57:48] <Jinxed-> anyway jquery is pretty fun
[20:58:00] <Jinxed-> thinking I probably need to learn some server side language to go with it
[20:58:05] <Jinxed-> python or php
[20:58:30] <Jinxed-> Also looking at phonegap to make some of the jquery stuff into mobile apps
[20:58:33] <Jinxed-> like my draft picker
[20:58:37] <doug65536> Jinxed-: php is easy-mode. python is more low level because you need to mess with templating
[20:59:02] <Jinxed-> doug65536: what serverside language do you prefer
[20:59:06] <doug65536> Jinxed-: php is a pretty goofy language though imho
[20:59:08] <Jinxed-> and what do you use for databasing
[20:59:25] <doug65536> Jinxed-: php has mysqli. it's very easy and well documented
[20:59:46] <doug65536> Jinxed-: almost every web host has mysql so that's all I've needed
[21:00:00] <doug65536> and it's fast. less than 1ms for a typical query
[21:00:37] <doug65536> well, sometimes less than 1ms. almost always less than 10ms
[21:03:00] <doug65536> Jinxed-: I've seen php code that pounds on mysql 10 or 20 times per page and they have good response times. properly designed code will fly
[21:03:16] <Jinxed-> nice
[21:04:27] <doug65536> Jinxed-: if you want speed, php has http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php - which can drastically improve performance
[21:05:03] <Jinxed-> doug65536: need to learn to crawl before I run
[21:05:08] <Jinxed-> :)
[21:05:15] <Jinxed-> I'm trying to make a bloody ball bounce
[21:05:28] <Jinxed-> Next project will probably be dynamic templates
[21:05:31] <doug65536> Jinxed-: of course - just keep it in the back of your mind if you do end up using php
[21:06:15] <Jinxed-> I do some cisco router configurations etc that use a lot of text configurations, I want to build it so it can read a text file in and generate a web UI to output actual configurations
[21:06:19] <Jinxed-> similar to what this guy did
[21:06:52] <Jinxed-> doug65536: http://packetlife.net/blog/2013/jul/26/lessons-learned-writing-custom-config-builder/
[21:06:55] <doug65536> Jinxed-: there are tons of templating systems
[21:06:57] <Jinxed-> seems like a really fun project
[21:07:21] <Jinxed-> doug65536: stuff that can already do what that guy did??!
[21:07:38] <Jinxed-> I mean I generate one router config, and it basically has to be duplicated on multiple routers
[21:07:41] <Jinxed-> with only minor changes
[21:07:53] <Jinxed-> it would be awsome to have a templating system like that
[21:07:58] <doug65536> Jinxed-: I did web dev stuff before web 2.0 (ajax), and everything was, "read a template, search and replace placeholders, send the page". today there are frameworks that do that really well
[21:08:35] <doug65536> Jinxed-: back when perl was everywhere
[21:08:46] <doug65536> used everywhere*
[21:09:04] <Jinxed-> do you agree with that author that
[21:09:08] <Jinxed-> django is the way to go?
[21:09:35] <doug65536> Jinxed-: I wouldn't know, I haven't used it
[21:10:04] <doug65536> Jinxed-: from what I've seen it's really good though
[21:10:25] <Jinxed-> well like i said that's probably where I'm going next
[21:10:49] <doug65536> Jinxed-: the way you can wrap a loop around a fragment of the document is brilliant
[21:13:16] <doug65536> Jinxed-: that part makes php look silly by comparison
[21:13:28] <Jinxed-> haha nice
[21:13:33] <Jinxed-> well doug65536 it's been fun
[21:13:35] <Jinxed-> but I need sleep
[21:13:38] <Jinxed-> work day tomorrow
[21:13:39] <Jinxed-> adios
[21:13:42] <Jinxed-> thanks for all the help
[21:13:42] <doug65536> Jinxed-: good night
[21:13:44] <doug65536> np
[21:48:23] <hbcreative> Hey everyone! Good to be here :)
[22:33:10] <NCS_One> hi
[22:47:37] <lovesh> can i get the live html content of dom
[22:47:52] <lovesh> because .html() gives the static html
[23:00:29] <Cork> lovesh: there are no live html
[23:00:43] <Cork> lovesh: you can serialize the dom to html, but html is never live
[23:04:01] <lovesh> i have some text boxes in my dom but when i change their values in my browser their value property does not change
[23:04:33] <Cork> lovesh: the property changes, but not the attributes (what you have in the html)
[23:05:28] <Cork> lovesh: but why do you need the html?
[23:05:47] <Cork> sounds like you are going about something the wrong way
[23:07:38] <lovesh> because i have some text boxes and some other elements in my dom and when the text of text boxes change i want to grab the live html content with the text of text boxes changed
[23:07:49] <rose_> hi,iam working with ios phonegap application.Iam using FB login and logout.I successfully logged in facebook.But my problem is iam not able to log the user out.FB.logout(function(response){document.location.reload(true); alert("fbLogout"); I use this code but not looging out..Please help me..
[23:08:17] <Cork> lovesh: that is the point, why do you want the html?
[23:08:31] <Cork> lovesh: the field values should be everything you need
[23:08:59] <lovesh> i want to generate html that looks like the previous html
[23:09:31] <Cork> lovesh: so have the html static, and from the saved field value set the input boxes
[23:09:55] <Cork> much less data to save, and would give the same result
[23:14:42] <NCS_One> can someone please help me with: http://jsfiddle.net/JWTjf/
[23:15:08] <Cork> NCS_One: always start by stating the problem
[23:15:50] <NCS_One> Cork: it is on the fiddle
[23:26:17] <doug65536> NCS_One: events propagate to all parents to the top of the DOM tree
[23:26:36] <doug65536> NCS_One: you need to take a parameter in your click handler
[23:26:57] <doug65536> or make your click handler more specific
[23:27:51] <doug65536> NCS_One: ah, I see what you're doing...
[23:29:31] <doug65536> NCS_One: problem is your selector for div1 selects both anchors
[23:30:48] <doug65536> NCS_One: solved: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/JWTjf/8/
[23:32:48] <NCS_One> damn
[23:32:56] <NCS_One> didnt notice that
[23:33:05] <NCS_One> doug65536: thanks
[23:33:10] <doug65536> NCS_One: yw
[23:37:22] <Tingle> I use phpass framework, and the hashes I generated yesterday and compared with the checkpassword() function worked fine yesterday, but today it keeps returning false, so I regenerated the hashes for the password and now it works again. how can this be, I had portable_hash set to false, so basicly new PasswordHash(12, false) - thinking this might be the problem I set it to true when generating the new hashes today
[23:37:22] <Tingle>  - but I cant test if that was it until tomarrow again considering I cant alter the webservers clock. Anyone have experience with this?
[23:37:54] <doug65536> Tingle: hashes have nothing to do with the clock
[23:38:10] <doug65536> Tingle: the whole idea of a hash is it is deterministic
[23:38:38] <doug65536> Tingle: looking for phpass docs...

[23:41:24] <Tomashe\> hey doug65536
[23:41:35] <doug65536> Tomashe\: hi
[23:41:41] <parad0x0n> i have a kinda special question bout javascript/jquery , allready tried findin a solution via google/stackoverflow sadly all i found wasnt that helpfull :/
[23:42:32] <Tomashe\> anyone can help ... ? http://www.lasso.co.il/ when u scroll down there is a "load more" but when i load more the boxs showing wrongly. it seems it doesn load the photos before it set the size of the boxs what make them overflow each other in case of big images.. any solution?
[23:42:39] <parad0x0n> just gonne drop it. if anyone has an idea/solution just answer/qry me... would be thankfull
[23:43:02] <doug65536> parad0x0n: What's the question?
[23:44:17] <doug65536> parad0x0n: an idea/solution for what? all you've said is that you have a question
[23:44:32] <parad0x0n> Im writin an Javascript application wich is meant to handle multiple javascript applications as lets say kinda application handler. The thing is im using localStorage to save actual applications data to be able to restore it on next visit. Actually my plan was to restoreall applications on browser restart(page revisit) on their last state. Storing and restoring the html/styles isnt any probloem. But i would like to store the bound events too.
[23:44:38] <parad0x0n> Im doin doug65536
[23:44:49] <doug65536> oh ok lol
[23:45:31] <Tingle> parad0x0n: then what is the reason for that behavior that the check returns fals today?
[23:46:27] <doug65536> Tomashe\: you can do .one('load', function() ...) on an img, then in that event handler, do the stuff that depends on the size of the image
[23:46:28] <parad0x0n> So i found at least $._data @ stackoverflow wich should show me the events that are bound. In the Stackoverflow example i see a printed out data object showin me all needed informations(including the code wich has been bound inside the click/mouseout function). When i try same code so the same call on the jquery $._data object i just get a list of assigned events but the handler function wich on stackoverflow included the assigned code to the event at me just
[23:46:43] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone has used the .css() propierty? I'm trying change some css but it not works. Anyone can help me? Thanks!
[23:46:43] <doug65536> Tomashe\: .one is not a typo - it requests a single event callback then auto detaches the event
[23:47:06] <doug65536> abailarri: show code
[23:47:24] <Tomashe\> h,,,
[23:47:27] <Tomashe\> hmm
[23:47:31] <Tomashe\> ok let me check
[23:47:38] <doug65536> parad0x0n: my suggestion is to hook .on and capture information there, then forward the call to the real .on
[23:47:48] <parad0x0n> Mh k.
[23:48:29] <parad0x0n> Would mean i hav to force all application developers for my application manager to use only .on but k i prolly dont see any other solution.
[23:48:32] <parad0x0n> thx anyway :)
[23:48:42] <doug65536> no it wouldn't
[23:48:47] <doug65536> everything ends up calling on
[23:48:53] <doug65536> the other ones are just wrappers that call on
[23:49:05] <abailarri> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/HqYeyEAq
[23:49:28] <doug65536> parad0x0n:  but since you are so quick to dismiss my suggestion, I'll say good luck to you and help someone else
[23:49:44] <parad0x0n> no i dont dismiss it
[23:49:46] <parad0x0n> dont take me wrong
[23:49:47] <parad0x0n> :)
[23:50:18] <Tomashe\> but how do i run it
[23:50:21] <parad0x0n> just had a very short night cuz of tryin to find a solution that just stores any type of event. i just kinda overslept so dont take me offensive .)
[23:50:30] <Tomashe\> let me show you
[23:51:41] <Tomashe\> http://jsfiddle.net/jxA6j/
[23:53:26] <doug65536> parad0x0n: this shows that you can intercept on calls and capture the information http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/p3ycT/
[23:54:18] <parad0x0n> *click* thx
[23:54:20] <doug65536> parad0x0n: another approach would be to use $.data(element) to get that information but I'm not sure how effective that would be
[23:54:41] <parad0x0n> doug65536: as i mentioned $.data doesnt help cuz it doesnt store the content of anonymous assigned functions
[23:54:58] <doug65536> parad0x0n: ok, well the hook technique does
[23:55:04] <parad0x0n> ye thx
[23:55:35] <parad0x0n> big thx man :)
[23:55:36] <doug65536> parad0x0n: if you can reliably capture the element array the rest should be serializable easily
[23:55:44] <parad0x0n> <3
[23:56:11] <parad0x0n> will deliver my piece of code when its done .)
[23:56:33] <doug65536> Tomashe\: where does new_p come from?
[23:57:13] <parad0x0n> At all this will be a small JS based system Includin a basic system core, an application manager , a window manager and a filesystem all js local based using local storage. AES encryptin every safed data on leave :) easy to write applications for it
[23:57:51] <parad0x0n> no longer gonne disturb you now. thx again , jquery has great community :)!
[23:57:59] <Tomashe\> new_p set below
[23:58:12] <Tomashe\> i did not show u the full part
[23:58:17] <Tomashe\> let me paste u everything
[23:58:23] <parad0x0n> 44/exit
[23:58:54] <Tomashe\> http://jsfiddle.net/jxA6j/1/
[23:58:56] <Tomashe\> thats it
[23:58:59] <doug65536> Tomashe\: itemids.push($(this).attr...)  is much easier
[23:59:16] <doug65536> itemsids
[23:59:56] <doug65536> Tomashe\: [] is easier than new Array()
