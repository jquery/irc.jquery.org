[00:18:55] <Reith> Hi, I'm looking for a link to a jquery plugin simulating Firefox DOM inspection tool. It was focusJS or something. Does anyone have a link to it?
[00:25:22] <tw2113> why not use the firefox dom inspection tool?
[00:29:08] <funhouse> Hi there, is there a function to easily shuffle an array?
[00:29:20] <funhouse> sort of like shuffle() in php.
[00:31:48] <ilyai> funhouse: not sure for jQuery, but Underscore.JS has it.
[00:34:04] <funhouse> ilyai: ok thank you, just found this function seems to work fine --> http://pastebin.com/QNh6QyTz
[00:47:17] <zafu> hi, how do I build a selector that says every element _except_ '#priceable td' ?
[00:48:44] <Phil-Work> *:not(#priceable td)
[00:48:57] <zafu> thanks
[01:00:44] <jop008> if you want to set html to a dom element what to use
[01:01:06] <jop008> .append (chtml) grows after multiple calls
[01:04:39] <zafu> is :not(...) the same as *:not(...) ?
[01:33:35] <shoky> zafu
[01:33:41] <shoky> zafu: yes
[01:34:21] <shoky> actually no sorry, my mistake

[01:42:21] <styx51> hi all again
[01:43:03] <styx51> is there a way to get all the css properties of an element to make an object of it ???
[01:46:42] <Lann> ugh…how do you .append content to an iframe in IE? The following code works in all browsers but IE: $('#myframe').contents().find('html').append(myForm);
[01:49:27] <jaya> How to convert HTML to XML ?
[01:49:33] <jaya> using js
[01:51:33] <ilyai> Lann: each iframe is associated with it's own window context. you can get it via property 'contentWindow'. then operate on it
[01:51:59] <Lann> …in IE?
[01:52:16] <Lann> like i said, this code functions in all browsers but IE
[01:52:18] <shoky> Lann: also.. appending to the <html> tag seems odd
[01:56:24] <ilyai> Lann: try accessing it with window[0] or window.frames[0]
[01:57:59] <ilyai> change 0 to corresponing iframe index if it's not the first
[01:59:23] <Lann> hmm ok
[01:59:25] <shoky> styx51: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1471256/1098884
[02:06:31] <Lann> ilyai: window.frames[ myframename ].document).find("pre").append(myForm) still does not actually append the form in IE
[02:07:05] <Lann> $(window.frames[ myframename ].document).find("pre").append(myForm);  rather
[02:10:56] <Lann> oh interesting, javascript worked: window.frames[ framename ].document.write(myForm.html());
[02:11:10] <ilyai> Lann: are you really sure it executes suceessfully and on the right iframe. can you modify (or inspect) it with .innerHTML ?
[02:11:38] <Lann> well i think this solution works
[02:35:10] <motaka2> hello , i load javascript like <script src="..."></script> and some HTML using ajax request, is there anyway that I can make sure that first the javascript is loaded and second the html comes in DOM , notice that I have several js files per request
[02:38:01] <ravenzz> motaka2 do you mean load all the scripts first and then do the ajax req?
[02:38:13] <motaka2> ravenzz: Yes
[02:39:09] <ravenzz> well if you put your js in the head it should be loaded
[02:40:26] <motaka2> ravenzz: no, I have to call them in ajax
[02:42:47] <ravenzz> what do you mean?
[02:43:46] <ravenzz> do you get some js and html from an ajax req?
[02:46:35] <Lann> jesus did that code ever get ugly now with IE support
[03:39:05] <QuackQuacker> Hi, im familiar with jquery, how ajax works, serverside stuff and etc.. though  im often worried about the load of frequent request for getting newst chat msg etc.. could anyone recommend a ajax plugin that is ok performence wise
[03:39:20] <QuackQuacker> im using php serverside so there will be no pushing
[03:45:54] <ilyai> QuackQuacker: why do you think it's not possible to use pushing with php?
[04:10:10] <jimquery> Hey guys, anyone able to spare a minute and take a look at my code here: http://pastebin.com/rzEQ1tu3 . Trying to "multi-thread" (probably not technically the correct term) email sending here, but though many are marked as sending, it does not seem to go any faster in practise. It does, however, appear to traverse the list one at a time. Is this a Jquery limitation or perhaps even a server limitation?
[04:14:52] <QuackQuacker> Hi jimquery
[04:15:30] <r1card> Question, does anyone know a library/utility/something that converts this foo["bar.baz.qux"] to this:  foo["bar"]["baz"]["qux"]
[04:16:26] <QuackQuacker> <ilyai> QuackQuacker: why do you think it's not possible to use pushing with php? << im not familiar with how this should work. If i could setup something that would react somewhat like Node pushing to an clientside worker
[04:16:34] <QuackQuacker> but i dunno how to do something like that with php
[04:17:55] <ilyai> QuackQuacker: if you aren't restricted to old browsers you can try sever-sent events
[04:18:06] <ilyai> *server
[04:18:13] <ctienrsg> QuackQuacker: maybe I can help you
[04:18:30] <ctienrsg> there is a PHP string function for that
[04:18:57] <ctienrsg> dont worry about PHP, use it a few times and u'll understand it. Only shit that freenode has no php channel
[04:22:19] <QuackQuacker> ctienrsg,
[04:22:30] <ilyai> QuackQuacker: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events for example
[04:22:31] <QuackQuacker> sounds REAL good
[04:22:51] <QuackQuacker> YES
[04:22:59] <QuackQuacker> Thanks ilyai and ctienrsg
[04:23:54] <QuackQuacker> This should be much more effecient
[04:25:18] <ctienrsg> QuackQuacker: look at string functions. in php, there is always one for your current need
[04:26:13] <QuackQuacker> ctienrsg, yea, i use ZendFramework or CodeIgniter so this is quite easy to implement (espcially with a REST interface)
[04:26:29] <QuackQuacker> i just have no knowlegde of streaming (pushing) states.. but i guess thats what im going to learn now
[04:27:09] <ctienrsg> i think codecademy has tutorial look there
[04:27:14] <QuackQuacker> This is very cool and exactly the solution i was hoping for... in a couple of years when the old browser versions die out some more.. this kind will be the standard
[04:27:21] <QuackQuacker> ok ill take a look
[04:27:28] <QuackQuacker> I need to read up on the streaming part
[04:31:07] <Gorkyman> man, this positioning is killing me in ui
[04:34:54] <ctienrsg> QuackQuacker: maybe u can answer me my question (only if u want)
[04:35:11] <QuackQuacker> I hope i can
[04:35:12] <QuackQuacker> sure
[04:37:56] <ctienrsg> http://pastebin.com/BBWEwtnx
[04:38:34] <ctienrsg> QuackQuacker: my header and footer are displayed twice. I have deleted header and footer includes in the included stuff of course
[04:39:08] <QuackQuacker> Hmm
[04:39:25] <QuackQuacker> and the file im looking at is the requested on, it isnt included in another?
[04:39:52] <ctienrsg> u look at the index.php
[04:40:19] <QuackQuacker> does any of the ca, s, m, c, f, 4 include anything?
[04:40:50] <ctienrsg> yes
[04:41:11] <QuackQuacker> does any of them include the footer or header
[04:41:16] <ctienrsg> nope
[04:41:33] <ctienrsg> So when I would only include one of them, there would be no header and footer in it
[04:41:42] <QuackQuacker> oh
[04:41:45] <ctienrsg> But why is the header and footer displayed twice?
[04:41:53] <QuackQuacker> Can i see your header
[04:42:07] <marcinm> Guys i want to modify css class, and precisly i want to add this -> "@include blbla;"
[04:42:09] <QuackQuacker> Maybe you have a bad tag which is making the browser self generate the header
[04:42:21] <marcinm> how i can achieve this in simplest way
[04:42:21] <QuackQuacker> is it the same header included twice (like title tag etc are the same?)
[04:42:51] <marcinm> css method is not enough for me
[04:43:14] <ctienrsg> ok i give u the header
[04:43:17] <QuackQuacker> marcinm, do you want to change the css sheet?
[04:43:28] <QuackQuacker> and not a element in the html dom?
[04:44:05] <marcinm> QuackQuacker: sorry this was stupid, now i reliazed that i want to add preprocessed code to already proccessed css
[04:44:10] <marcinm> QuackQuacker: sorry
[04:44:13] <QuackQuacker> thats okay
[04:44:40] <marcinm> this method is called rubish duck i think ;)
[04:46:28] <ctienrsg> QuackQuacker: http://pastebin.com/vvutnnTd
[04:46:47] <ctienrsg> this is header (of course shortened a little bit as always to make debugging easier)
[04:47:08] <QuackQuacker> your head
[04:47:13] <QuackQuacker> tag is missing the closing >
[04:47:25] <QuackQuacker> line 4
[04:48:56] <ctienrsg> nope that is just  a shortening error i just made
[04:49:01] <ctienrsg> in the original it is correct
[04:49:30] <ctienrsg> only php is the req_uri but still twice header and footer
[04:49:41] <QuackQuacker> also the shit on meta comment
[04:49:51] <QuackQuacker> should be <!-- Shit on meta -->
[04:50:24] <ctienrsg> yes but hope u get what i wanted to say
[04:50:41] <ctienrsg> I just want to  understand why called twice on header
[04:50:45] <ctienrsg> and footer
[04:50:50] <QuackQuacker> yea
[04:51:05] <ctienrsg> my nesting and other html blabla is excellent quality, nothing wrong there
[04:51:09] <QuackQuacker> i must admit im having a hard time seeing
[04:51:14] <QuackQuacker> try changint it to
[04:51:16] <QuackQuacker> require_once
[04:51:22] <ctienrsg> sounds good!
[04:51:37] <ctienrsg> can u tell me a bit more about req_once or give link?
[04:51:41] <ctienrsg> what does it do?
[04:52:07] <QuackQuacker> yes it says require, if it fails loading gives a blocking error. If it is already loaded, it gives a blocking error
[04:52:27] <QuackQuacker> http://php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php
[04:53:12] <ctienrsg> will try that
[04:53:48] <QuackQuacker> and if no differnce please try http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include-once.php   ... include_once($file);
[04:54:00] <ctienrsg> hey it works now! but without req_once
[04:54:25] <ctienrsg> I had forgotten to get rid of header and footer include in some file
[04:54:32] <ctienrsg> but it wasn't the home site
[04:54:53] <ctienrsg> didn't know this is parsed as well… Confused even more
[04:57:49] <QuackQuacker> Cool
[04:58:20] <QuackQuacker> That you found the real challange :)
[05:00:35] <ctienrsg> of course if i call a.php i have no header/footer. will need to fix that
[05:01:37] <marcinm> How i can achieve better quality after css rotate for example in chrome, someone try to improve this effect ?
[05:02:11] <bwen> is there a way I can specify the following: $('section > div') but i'd like ot be able to do $('> div', $section) ?
[05:02:44] <ctienrsg> bwen no traversing possible?
[05:02:59] <ctienrsg> I get everywhere I want with traversing
[05:03:11] <bwen> ctienrsg: i'm sorry... traversing?
[05:03:32] <ctienrsg> Ok, I hand u over to some guy explaining u
[05:03:38] <bwen> ic
[05:03:42] <bwen> googled it
[05:04:05] <ctienrsg> http://try.jquery.com/levels/2/challenges/1
[05:05:01] <dabear> bwen: .find
[05:05:26] <ctienrsg> dabear: think better if we let him make tutorial then he can help himself in the future
[05:11:36] <bwen> dabear: nah find is no good. it gives your a list of elements, I need exactly $('section > div)
[05:12:11] <dabear> bwen: .find(">div") or just .children()
[05:12:49] <bwen> hm I had assumed it wouldnt work since: $('> div', $section); didnt.. I am gonna give it a try
[05:13:28] <bwen> yeah doesnt work
[05:13:37] <bwen> i'll find something I guess
[05:18:01] <bwen> oh nice, .closest() accepts a context. That just might be it :]
[05:18:37] <dabear> bwen: .find(">foo") works
[05:19:29] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/VhwMw/
[05:20:12] <bwen> then the problem is elsewhere. hmm
[05:23:06] <bwen> yep found the error :P
[05:23:26] <bwen> had nothing to do with my selectors :p
[05:24:15] <dabear> maybe there was a case of acute PEBKAC going on..?:)
[05:25:41] <ctienrsg> dabear: yes the classic error -40
[05:27:52] <dabear> ctienrsg: surely you mean error 42
[05:28:01] <bwen> -.-
[05:28:16] <bwen> I did endup using the find('> div') :)
[05:31:30] <dabear> children() is faster
[05:31:31] <dabear> but ok
[05:51:49] <roflmaus> What's the simpliest way to display a dialog with a textbox and OK/Cancel buttons (and to read info from it)?
[05:52:28] <Ungy> what do you mean read inf from it?
[05:53:05] <Ungy> do you care how it looks?
[05:53:57] <roflmaus> Ungy, i want to ask user to input a value. I'd be happy with default looks.

[06:29:38] <jay> that's what i implemented
[06:29:42] <Ungy> or if you prefer http://tinker.io/78418/6
[06:29:45] <jay> y it is not working
[06:29:56] <Ungy> well on that page you had to add jQuery in the settings
[06:30:00] <Ungy> but whatever

[06:32:14] <jay> thnx anyway
[06:34:08] <Snoopal> hey guys. im wondering why $(document).height(); returns me a hight which is 100px less than the actualy rendered height?
[06:34:33] <Ungy> when is it run before or after somethign is changed
[06:35:27] <Snoopal> hm what do i need to do, that it returns correct height?
[06:36:02] <Ungy> if everything is loaded and done it should return the correct height
[06:36:36] <Snoopal> im calling it in $(document).ready(function() {});
[06:37:23] <Ungy> and do you have any other code running after?
[06:39:09] <Snoopal> actually it should run before
[06:39:56] <Ungy> I have no idea what you are trying to do when you call that it shoudl get the height at the time of call that is the best I can tell you
[06:40:33] <Snoopal> :(
[06:43:29] <dabear> Snoopal: .height only returns the current visible height of the document
[06:44:42] <Ungy> worded differently but ok
[06:46:48] <Snoopal> hmm but when i check the element in chrome it shows me, that the actual height is much more higher
[06:47:36] <dabear> Snoopal: you can get this without jquery
[06:47:40] <dabear> document.body.scrollHeight
[06:49:43] <Snoopal> hmm this returns me the same result like jquery
[06:51:01] <Ungy> when you call that if anything loads or is modified after the value woudl nto be correct
[06:51:30] <Snoopal> is there a way to update the information
[06:51:49] <Ungy> call it when you need it?
[06:52:17] <Snoopal> its the last script that i call
[06:52:36] <Ungy> what ar eyou trying to do man
[06:53:19] <Snoopal> i have a sidebar, which should have the height of the content
[06:54:09] <Ungy> your trying to do equal height columns?
[06:54:20] <Snoopal> yes
[06:54:26] <Ungy> use css
[06:55:05] <Snoopal> content is modified by javascript ^^
[06:55:12] <Ungy> so?
[06:56:07] <Ungy> Snoopal http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/ultimate-multi-column-liquid-layouts-em-and-pixel-widths
[06:56:21] <Ungy> pick a layout out they work
[06:56:30] <Ungy> and stretch properly
[06:56:57] <Snoopal> ha! thanks man :)
[06:57:09] <Ungy> much easier to deal with
[06:57:49] <Ungy> could have saved yourself a lot of time telling us what your trying to do ;-p
[06:57:58] <Snoopal> :P
[07:02:18] <FELS_zh> hi all
[07:02:28] <FELS_zh> anyone got experience with Turnjs ??
[07:06:56] <FELS_zh> help... pls
[07:08:55] <Ungy> I am beginning to think I should just leave this channel no one asks any real questions. Is it always just whinny children saying help or asking you to do their work for them?
[07:21:51] <zissou> can you use percents when updating element's css
[07:24:06] <Ungy> zissou if the css attribute accepts percetage yes
[07:24:15] <ctienrsg> Ungy: I agree
[07:24:29] <zissou> i realized that i have to define it as string
[07:24:43] <zissou> if i dont it acts like i used px
[07:24:53] <zissou> or breaks
[07:26:36] <Ungy> "10%" "10em" "10px" 10 gets intepreted as "10px" althoguh it is bad they are making up for crappy developers
[07:27:14] <Ungy> gotta go
[07:28:57] <jay> http://tinker.io/78418/7
[07:29:02] <jay> hey guys
[07:29:08] <jay> need help here http://tinker.io/78418/7
[07:29:18] <seaworthy> you i have something like this <div id="popup"><div id="body"></div></div> how to i append element to #body
[07:30:00] <seaworthy> the thing is that i might have many #body on page how do i target that it is specifically within the popup div
[07:31:20] <jay> need help here >>>> http://tinker.io/78418/7
[07:38:51] <fikst> seaworthy, you cannot have many #body on your page
[07:38:55] <fikst> id's should be unique
[07:39:16] <seaworthy> of course i can
[07:39:23] <gnarf> http://events.jquery.org/2013/portland/
[07:39:26] <gnarf> anyone going?
[07:39:27] <fikst> no you cant
[07:39:43] <seaworthy> anyway i figured it out
[07:39:55] <fikst> or, yes you can, but you should not
[07:40:07] <seaworthy> $('#helpPopup').find('#body').append('<p><b>Description Formatting Tips</b></p>');
[07:40:39] <seaworthy> have it all named the same saves you time and makes it easir
[07:41:07] <seaworthy> when you have a tempting system
[07:41:11] <fikst> seaworthy, there is no need to use find
[07:41:15] <seaworthy> templating
[07:41:28] <fikst> and again, id's should be unique
[07:41:39] <fikst> use classes if you will have more than 1
[07:41:45] <roflmaus> I've got this code working fine in a fiddle service: http://jsbin.com/obemig/17/edit But when i put it into a Sinatra app, the `$("#controls input").change` and `$('#equalize').click` stop working without notice, while `$(document).ready` and `$(window).resize`. Why?
[07:42:06] <roflmaus> If i copy the non-working part into FireBug console and execute, it works!
[07:42:15] <seaworthy> okay, what if i have 3 popups and i want to use one template for them
[07:42:35] <seaworthy> the stuff you are talking about won't let me do it. fikst
[07:42:46] <fikst> use classes
[07:42:57] <seaworthy> ???
[07:43:11] <seaworthy> using classes has nothing to do with it
[07:43:49] <fikst> yes it does, you cannot have multiple elements with the same id
[07:43:51] <seaworthy> just tell me whats wrong with using find
[07:44:13] <fikst> $('#helpPopup #body')
[07:44:37] <fikst> but, then again, because id's are unique, u should just use $('#body')
[07:45:33] <seaworthy> they are not unique
[07:45:51] <fikst> they should be...
[07:46:00] <seaworthy> look i only see what i am trying to do right now possible with shared ids okay
[07:46:01] <seaworthy> ?
[07:46:51] <fikst> why can you use class="body"?
[07:46:57] <fikst> cant*
[07:47:05] <sacho> what makes you think you can't?
[07:47:10] <sacho> oh, sorry
[07:47:51] <seaworthy> i can
[07:47:55] <seaworthy> hmm
[07:48:32] <seaworthy> sorry i wasn't not sure what you meant by class, i thought you meant making some kind on a js class and managing popups that way
[07:48:37] <seaworthy> you are right, my bad
[07:51:39] <seaworthy> finskt so if  i am using a class instead of the id how do i modify this? $('#helpPopup #body')
[07:52:07] <seaworthy> i still want to make sure i stay inside the help popup
[07:52:41] <gnarf> seaworthy: #helpPopup .body ?
[07:52:43] <fikst> $('#helpPopup .body')
[07:53:55] <seaworthy> nice! all right thanks, sorry for arguing lol
[07:54:11] <fikst> np :)
[08:12:56] <cameron262> how could i create a thing that is two images layed on top of each other, but while you hover the mouse over it it cuts through the first layer in a feathered circle shape to show the image underneath for the time while it is hoevered?
[08:31:23] <Ungy> uhh cameron262 absolute positioning with z-index
[08:37:36] <cameron262> Ungy, yeah it was the second part which im not sure about
[08:42:00] <Ungy> what do you mean the second part?
[08:45:18] <cameron262> while you hover the mouse over it it cuts through the first layer in a feathered circle shape to show the image underneath for the time while it is hoevered?
[08:45:35] <cameron262> ungy
[08:46:51] <Ungy> cameron262 well you would atach a hover on the elements parent as to how to get that specific effect I am not sure
[08:58:21] <Agbeladem> Hi guys
[09:02:36] <Agbeladem> I got a div container with mousedown and mouseup events. Inside I have buttons with click event, and a stopPropagation call(), but when I click on the button it still activates the mousedown event ?
[09:08:32] <Ungy> Agbeladem as it should
[09:09:28] <Agbeladem> Ungy: so I need to put a mouseup event with a stopPropagation() call to my buttons, right ?
[09:09:59] <Ungy> Agbeladem wouldn't know I never violate that
[09:10:39] <Agbeladem> Ungy: hmm it seems to be working. What would you do ? Stop using click() when you start using mousedown somewhere ?
[09:11:53] <Ungy> no I never put form items or anchors in something that has a mouse event on it
[09:12:50] <Ungy> why cause myself problems when I do not have to
[09:13:21] <Agbeladem> well I have div that can be selected and dragged, but they do have buttons on it
[09:13:29] <Agbeladem> it's not like I have that much of a choice in this situation lol
[09:14:43] <jedrek> is there some sort of ultra-lightweight jquery-esque library that will let me use the $() selectors and maybe .css() and .attr() and nothing else?
[09:14:51] <Ungy> I would frame the object itself and only allow the drag on the frame or better yet have a mode where the drag is available and a mode where it is not
[09:15:15] <Ungy> jedrek use pure JS
[09:15:29] <jedrek> not really in the mood
[09:15:47] <Ungy> jedrek then why worry about using jQuery
[09:15:48] <jedrek> but i feel like a fool loading 90k into a mobile app to flip a couple divs and stuff
[09:16:03] <Ungy> why not jQuery.mobile
[09:16:17] <Ungy> and use a hosted URI for load it may be cachede
[09:16:24] <jedrek> have you used jquery mobile?
[09:16:39] <Ungy> only a few experiments with it
[09:17:04] <jedrek> it's 144k
[09:17:22] <jedrek> i think i've found something
[09:18:08] <jedrek> http://marcelbeumer.com/im/
[09:18:12] <jedrek> toodle pip
[09:18:15] <Ungy> OK well most phones have a cached version of jQuery Mobile by now but I se your point
[09:19:30] <Ungy> that link has no valid download links
[09:34:42] <JohnnyCache> I have <span id=parent> <span id=child1></span><span id=child2><span id=childofchild></span></span> </span>
[09:34:59] <JohnnyCache> I want to change the styles of all the child spans of #parent but not the #childofchild
[09:35:05] <JohnnyCache> change the class**
[09:35:55] <JohnnyCache> $("#parent").each("span") will select ALL the spans inside, is there any way to select only one-level childs?
[09:36:05] <JohnnyCache> first-level i mean
[09:38:28] <JohnnyCache> oh n/m found it :)
[09:42:39] <gnarf> JohnnyCache: surely you also meant .find("span") ?
[09:42:47] <gnarf> `api children
[09:42:47] <b-ot> gnarf: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[09:43:24] <gnarf> JohnnyCache: .children( selector ) is prolly best, but i'm pretty sure you can also .find("> span")
[09:43:38] <gnarf> but i remember there being potential issues with using positional selectors in a find
[09:53:00] <Agbeladem> what's the selector for "not in .x class"?
[09:53:38] <sacho> there's no such selector
[09:53:57] <Agbeladem> damn, how would you do ? :D
[09:54:07] <fikst> .not()
[09:54:18] <sacho> select and filter.
[09:54:19] <Agbeladem> yeah but I'm using '.next'
[09:54:30] <Agbeladem> I wanted the next element that does not have a given class
[09:54:55] <Agbeladem> :/
[09:55:08] <sacho> That's not what you asked
[09:55:10] <sacho> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[09:55:31] <Agbeladem> ??
[09:55:39] <Agbeladem> oh okay
[09:55:57] <Agbeladem> so $(element).next(':not(.myclass)') ?
[09:56:13] <sacho> tias
[09:56:24] <Agbeladem> thanks !
[09:57:27] <gnarf> actually
[09:57:33] <gnarf> that doesn't work Agbeladem
[09:57:49] <gnarf> .next() will only ever get the next element
[09:58:06] <gnarf> it will either be the next, or empty
[09:58:11] <gnarf> if you pass it a selector
[09:58:21] <Agbeladem> that's what I'm doing dude
[09:58:26] <Agbeladem> oO
[09:58:32] <Agbeladem> oh you mean
[09:58:36] <gnarf> .nextAll(':not(.myclass)').first()
[09:58:46] <Agbeladem> that sounds not optimized lol
[09:58:46] <gnarf> `api nextall
[09:58:46] <b-ot> gnarf: .nextAll(): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[09:59:05] <gnarf> Agbeladem: selections are rarely optimal
[09:59:11] <Agbeladem> yeah that's right
[09:59:12] <Agbeladem> but still
[09:59:23] <Agbeladem> I don't find "next or empty" very intuitive
[09:59:41] <Agbeladem> next(selector) should give "the next that matches the selector"
[09:59:45] <gnarf> .next() is basicaly .nextSibling
[09:59:57] <gnarf> .next(selector) is .next().filter(selector)
[10:00:04] <Agbeladem> alright
[10:00:08] <Agbeladem> still not intuitive to me :P
[10:00:27] <gnarf> Agbeladem: there's a reason i made sure to explain it
[10:00:28] <gnarf> :)
[10:02:09] <Agbeladem> gnarf: yeah I get the logit
[10:02:11] <Agbeladem> logic*
[10:02:18] <Agbeladem> doesn't mean the logic is right to my mind :P
[10:02:28] <Agbeladem> but thanks for the explanation anyway
[10:02:30] <gnarf> sure, it was confusing the first time i ran into that
[10:02:50] <gnarf> but knowing how it's written, it actually makes too much sense
[10:03:34] <gnarf> Agbeladem: if you want more optimized
[10:05:01] <gnarf> jQuery.fn.nextMatch = function(selector) { return this.map(function() { var elem = this; while ( elem = elem.nextSibling ) { if ( jQuery(elem).is(selector) ) return elem; } }); };
[10:05:07] <gnarf> that might work
[10:05:15] <gnarf> i just coded it on an airplane in an IRC chat tho
[10:05:17] <gnarf> so YMMV
[10:06:49] <Zitter> how to get "data-item" attribute in <button data-item="myValue"> $(this).attr("data-item") returns 'undefined'
[10:07:09] <gnarf> Zitter: it should return 'myValue' are you sure this is right?
[10:07:16] <gnarf> console log this.dataset.item ?
[10:07:33] <gnarf> also, you can use .data('item') - it will read the initial value from the data-* attribs
[10:07:42] <gnarf> `api data
[10:07:42] <b-ot> gnarf: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:10:01] <Zitter> ok, maybe I've done some mistakes
[10:10:15] <Zitter> s/maybe/surely/
[10:17:13] <FELS_zh> help... pls
[10:17:58] <FELS_zh> i want ot make a page turn for images but must work on iphone _ iwant to use it phonegap
[10:53:49] <WASD> Someone once mentioned to me a javscript library that was exactly like jquery but without IE6 support, thus making it several times smaller. Does anyone know the name of this library?
[10:54:50] <sonotos> WASD: http://zeptojs.com/ maybe but the don't have ie support at all
[10:55:07] <WASD> Yes that was the name, thanks :)
[10:55:38] <sonotos> WASD: i think jquery2 is the better option, the removed legacy ie support too
[10:56:16] <WASD> I'll look into that. It was maybe a year ago since I worked with jquery so I have missed that
[10:57:58] <WASD> zepto is however almost 10 times smaller in size than both of them, heh
[10:58:45] <sonotos> WASD: well as mentioned they have NO ie support
[10:58:58] <sonotos> not only no legacy support
[10:59:06] <WASD> Sounds good to me
[10:59:24] <WASD> I'll try zepto and switch to jquery 2 if I encounter problems
[10:59:45] <sonotos> sounds like a plan
[11:00:50] <nsanden> or you can fallback on jquery for ie only?
[11:02:20] <WASD> that's a solution too
[11:03:05] <WASD> But this is just for a personal userscript that I'm going to share with some friends. If they use IE, they are no longer my friends (jk)
[11:03:23] <sonotos> well i'm not sure how good the API compatibility really is, but you will find out soon
[11:03:50] <sonotos> i like the way you think :-)
[11:10:33] <boytoy> Anybody know how to replace the slide transition with fade transition at http://jsfiddle.net/jHvdr/ (SwipeJS aka. the world's most accurate mobile touch slider)
[11:16:10] <WASD> sonotos: for some reason $(".class").size() didn't work in zepto because $() returned null. Back to jquery2!
[11:16:40] <WASD> Which did work without any other modification
[11:17:29] <gnarf> sonotos: WASD: random fun fact: zepto has 2 times as many open bugs than jQuery does
[11:17:45] <WASD> heh
[11:17:50] <gnarf> WASD: another fun fact
[11:18:01] <gnarf> that 10 times size difference is < the size of one image file
[11:18:07] <gnarf> so get over it
[11:18:10] <sonotos> gnarf: hey i proposed jquery
[11:18:37] <gnarf> WASD: if you really want a tiny build
[11:18:41] <gnarf> and don't need part of jQuery
[11:18:48] <gnarf> you can checkout the repo and build it modular
[11:19:07] <gnarf> fully stripped down it's like 12k i think?
[11:19:19] <WASD> I'm not that hardcore
[11:19:31] <WASD> This is such a silly little task anyways. It doesn't matter how bloated it is.
[11:19:48] <WASD> I just wanted to hate on IE a little.
[11:29:11] <Tygerr> Hi, i made a jquery ui slider for a friend and the position is diferent on my friends pc, any ideas anyone?
[11:40:59] <ctienrsg> position? calls for CSS. please give snippet, Tygerr
[11:49:54] <lolmaus> Can i do something like `.debug()` to a jQuery object to send it to console and return it without breaking the flow? E. g. `var foo = $(this).outerHeight().debug();` would assign the variable and write its value in console
[11:50:35] <lolmaus> It would be way quicker than writing `console.log(foo);`
[11:51:05] <lolmaus> Especially when you have `return $(this).outerHeight();`, no variable
[12:00:20] <shoky> lolmaus: $.fn.debug = function() { console.log(this); return this; }
[12:09:52] <vinse> Hey everyone
[12:10:07] <vinse> How's it going
[12:14:05] <lolmaus> shoky, thx!
[12:17:35] <diverdude> when i do $(document).unbind('keydown'); do i then unbind all keydown handlers or a specific? (like the last added)
[12:18:48] <sacho_> all the bound handlers on the element(s)
[12:21:19] <lolmaus> shoky, it won't work for me, says not a function.
[12:23:33] <tw2113> lolmaus, how are you using it?
[12:26:15] <lolmaus> tw2113, i've written the line suggested by shoky in the beginning of my JS file, then i do `var fooHeight = $('foo').outerHeight().debug();`
[12:28:39] <zissou> make this http://jsfiddle.net/ alert 'bok'
[12:29:34] <tw2113> i wonder if it was not meant to be chained
[12:29:37] <zissou> ...cause i dont know how
[12:29:56] <tw2113> you didn't link to a set up jsfiddle either zissou
[12:30:16] <zissou> sry
[12:30:17] <zissou> http://jsfiddle.net/SJFC6/
[12:30:26] <tw2113> lolmaus, i got jQuery('#foo').debug();  to console log something
[12:31:35] <tw2113> lolmaus, try assigning the outer height to a variable and then run debug() on the variable
[12:31:50] <tw2113> var fooHeight =  jQuery('#foo').outerHeight(); $(fooHeight).debug();
[12:32:21] <lolmaus> tw2113, i could use `console.log` for that. The idea is to get rid of adding the second line.
[12:32:59] <tw2113> touche
[12:36:55] <shoky> lolmaus: outerHeight() returns a number, you said you wanna add it "to a jQuery object"
[12:37:47] <diverdude> sacho, so all bound handlers on document ?
[12:41:04] <lolmaus> shoky, sorry. Is it possible to do the same for any value, be it number, string or object?
[12:59:06] <CausaMortis> Evening :) I realise this might be asked a lot but i'm a bit confused about the ajax navigation system in jquery mobile 1.3.1. I've read the documentation and it seems by default the anchor element is automaticly hijacked by jquery ui. How does jquery know (when the href= is remote) what page content div will hold the content?
[12:59:11] <CausaMortis> On another note
[12:59:47] <CausaMortis> I also read that I shouldnt be returning a json response but instead I am better off returning simple html?
[13:05:03] <xylogicz> anyone have a dribble invite
[13:08:41] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/ZwkRB/1/ - how to open multiple UI dialog at the same time (different position)
[13:11:46] <CausaMortis> wer0ckz, not sure if this would be a viable solution but you could try giving them the same class?
[13:14:55] <CausaMortis> wer0ckz, nvm.. silly suggestion
[13:19:59] <wer0ckz> yeah sorry man my bad
[13:20:29] <CausaMortis> Could someone perhaps point me to a resource or fiddle to help me wrap my head around the ajax navigation system more? I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the official docs
[13:20:36] <CausaMortis> in jquery mobile that is
[13:21:12] <shoky> lolmaus: i wouldn't recommend it but i guess you can do:  Object.prototype.debug = function(){ var val = this.valueOf(); console.log(val); return val; }
[13:21:15] <wer0ckz> http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/ZwkRB/4/ - my dialog # 1 is on the back of dialog # 2. how can i make it both on front?

[13:52:30] <bobinator60> wer0ckz:
[13:52:42] <bobinator60> wer0ckz: not sure what you're asking exactly
[13:52:46] <shoky> wer0ckz: 'modal' is for one dialog at a time..
[13:53:55] <wer0ckz> i just want to put a box where its not part of a modal. box like another ui dialog
[13:53:59] <wer0ckz> is that possible?
[13:54:11] <shoky> stop using modal?
[13:55:48] <shoky> also, you're re-initializing the dialog widget on #dialog without first destroying the first instance with .dialog('destroy') . that's why the 3rd dialog is also modal and positioned like the 1st
[13:58:24] <wer0ckz> i see
[13:58:28] <wer0ckz> i'll try that. thank you
[14:01:57] <wer0ckz> shoky: lets say i wanted to use modal so that part of my page will not be clickable like menu's or links. is it possible to make part of my page  not part of a modal? like box?
[14:05:25] <shoky> wer0ckz: if you use the 'modal' option for .dialog(..), no i dont think you can do that. you can make your own overlay though, and set z-index of whatever you like

[14:56:43] <colinwren> mzarella: yes
[14:56:56] <fikst> mzarella, it is valid, browser will fill in the currently used protocol

[16:32:39] <relipse> how do i find all <option elements without a specific class?
[16:32:47] <relipse> and delete them from the DOM
[16:34:50] <wer0ckz> Help please. i got this line txt.val(txt.val() + 'Modem offline troubleshooting\n'); to append to my text area. a lot of them. every time i copy and paste using IE. it only appears on a single line.

[16:35:35] <relipse> wer0ckz: hmm
[16:35:52] <relipse> wer0ckz: textarea you can use $txt.html()
[16:36:05] <relipse> and if you are appending
[16:36:08] <relipse> just use $txt.append()
[16:36:15] <wer0ckz> i got hunders of txt.val(txt.val() in my code
[16:36:27] <wer0ckz> so i'll just use notepad++ and replace them all?
[16:36:34] <wer0ckz> is there a global function to replace them using jquery?

[16:45:18] <shoky> min|dvir|us: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11663
[16:45:18] <min|dvir|us> shoky: how do I prevent detach() from triggering a change?
[16:45:23] <madprops> I only have chromium
[16:45:27] <shoky> min|dvir|us:  try .blur().detach()  :P
[16:45:35] <min|dvir|us> shoky: the event is triggered twice still.
[16:45:39] <min|dvir|us> I know because I already tried that. :P
[16:45:42] <shoky> yeah :\
[16:45:57] <min|dvir|us> madprops: me too, error happens there.
[16:46:31] <min|dvir|us> shoky: it's not a jQuery bug: http://jsfiddle.net/xZtqw/3/
[16:46:34] <madprops> ok I got a NotFoundError
[16:47:03] <shoky> min|dvir|us: i didnt say it's a jquery bug
[16:47:18] <min|dvir|us> How do I fix it? :/
[16:47:24] <shoky> that bug report has a link to the chrome bug

[16:47:55] <IamTrying> I have a table with 5 rows. How can i trigger a click on row 1 ? e.g: $('.mycalls_table tr') .. and then??
[16:48:07] <min|dvir|us> wer0ckz: you're just making a new string with the values replaced.
[16:48:16] <min|dvir|us> wer0ckz: you have to $('#textarea').val(string).
[16:48:31] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: .click()
[16:49:14] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, how do i say its row 1? not row 5
[16:49:19] <wer0ckz> i got a script that appends on the text area
[16:49:20] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: :first-child
[16:49:23] <wer0ckz> \n is not working on I
[16:49:25] <wer0ckz> *IE
[16:49:29] <min|dvir|us> Or :nth-child(1).
[16:49:33] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, $("... :first-child").click() ?
[16:49:38] <min|dvir|us> Yep.
[16:49:42] <IamTrying> OK - Thanks min|dvir|us
[16:49:43] <adavia> anybody knows why im getting undefined when i console.log this or parent ? http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/2/
[16:50:01] <min|dvir|us> shoky: thanks for the bug report.
[16:57:01] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, This is somehow not clicking the first row and first column but clicking something else on that row column e.g:  $('.mycalls_table tr:nth-child(1)').trigger("click");
[16:57:37] <IamTrying> Need to click row1, col1 : <tr> <td>a  <td>b <td>c     <tr> <td>a  <td>b <td>c     <tr>
[16:58:23] <min|dvir|us> $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:first-child');
[16:58:23] <shoky> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/wpXNs/5/  :)
[16:58:31] <min|dvir|us> Or $('.mycalls_table td').first().
[16:58:55] <min|dvir|us> shoky: that's one way to do it, I guess.
[17:01:46] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, same failing. also this failing $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:nth-child(1)').click();
[17:02:00] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: dunno.
[17:02:15] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, is it counting from righ to left ? or left to right? when we say first-child or nth-child?
[17:03:03] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: it's what you'd expect.
[17:03:11] <min|dvir|us> console.log() it so you can make sure it's the right object.
[17:03:30] <relipse> i have an alphebatized list of subcategories, if i prepend each <option it will end up in reverse order, I can't append because I have existing <option elements, what do I do?
[17:04:23] <relipse> reverse sorting the array seems silly
[17:06:45] <IamTrying> OK - Thanks min|dvir|us it was my mistake somewhere i had: whichclick=0; $('.incomingcall').live("click", function() { whichclick=1;});
[17:07:50] <IamTrying> Can i say before this click do another click? $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:nth-child(1)').click(... here before the click ....);
[17:08:05] <IamTrying> $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:nth-child(1)').click(before , and after ??);
[17:08:25] <min|dvir|us> ?
[17:10:22] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:nth-child(1)').click( beforeSend: function() { }, complete: function() { } ) ?
[17:10:42] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, something like before the click event and once thats done then apply the main.
[17:11:26] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: event handlers are triggered "beforeSend".
[17:11:45] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: use setImmediate from within the handler to emulate "complete".
[17:12:00] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:nth-child(1)').trigger("click", function() { // after click ?? } );
[17:12:03] <IamTrying> OK
[17:15:38] <mattoly_> ahoy people
[17:23:59] <IamTrying> Why after the click `$('#connect').click(); ` is not getting executed? e.g: $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:nth-child(1)').click(function() { $('#connect').click(); } );
[17:24:21] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: just use :first-child instead of :nth-child(1).
[17:24:33] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: put a console.log() before and after to ensure it's executing.
[17:24:40] <IamTrying> OK
[17:24:53] <nsanden> anyone know of a really customizable slot machine effect
[17:25:13] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: you should really put an ID on that first cell anyway.
[17:25:22] <mattoly> oops. hello again
[17:25:54] <mattoly> anyone have any experience with form validation engine and using a div as a container to handle instead of a form element?
[17:26:14] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, before is fine but as soon as i have .click(function() { anything.... } ); it fails
[17:26:31] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: .click(function () {}) makes an event handler.
[17:26:42] <min|dvir|us> The stuff in the anonymous function is executed when the element is clicked.
[17:26:51] <min|dvir|us> .click() triggers all .click(function () {}) event handlers.
[17:28:07] <IamTrying> min|dvir|us, 1) this works:  $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:first-child').click() 2) but when i do this it does not. $('.mycalls_table tr:first-child td:first-child').click(function() { console.log(">>>>>>>test>>>>>"); } );
[17:28:25] <min|dvir|us> IamTrying: you have to click on it.

[17:29:07] <min|dvir|us> wer0ckz: are you going to make me spell it out for you?
[17:29:25] <min|dvir|us> Let's look at the chain of functions here.
[17:29:35] <min|dvir|us> $('#textarea') // This is a jQuery object.
[17:29:43] <min|dvir|us> ....val() // This is a string.
[17:30:05] <wer0ckz> example im using IE dialog and it appends on my textarea
[17:30:06] <wer0ckz> txt.val(txt.val() + 'Modem offline troubleshooting\n');
[17:30:15] <wer0ckz> the \n is not working on IE but working on firefox
[17:30:34] <wer0ckz> im talking about line break. sorry
[17:30:47] <min|dvir|us> wer0ckz: ahh, use a <pre>.
[17:30:52] <wer0ckz> where?
[17:30:56] <min|dvir|us> Instead of <textarea>.
[17:31:00] <wer0ckz> where to insert <pre>?
[17:31:06] <min|dvir|us> Instead of <textarea>.
[17:31:11] <wer0ckz> hmm
[17:31:50] <min|dvir|us> (You'd have to replace .val() with .text() everywhere.)
[17:32:02] <wer0ckz> is there any other work around? i got 3,000 lines that appends on a textarea
[17:32:20] <min|dvir|us> Are you using the textarea to store state?
[17:32:46] <wer0ckz> not really to store. just to have the user copy and paste the content
[17:32:52] <wer0ckz> but its working on firefox
[17:32:54] <wer0ckz> just the IE
[17:33:08] <wer0ckz> \n <-- firefox no problem
[17:33:30] <wer0ckz> should i create a jsfiddle? but jsfiddle doesnt work on my IE8 here
[17:33:41] <min|dvir|us> wer0ckz: I probably can't help, sorry.
[17:33:47] <wer0ckz> its alright
[17:36:12] <shoky> wer0ckz try jsbin.com
[17:41:41] <shoky> or... download a real browser
[17:42:13] <shoky> and add /show to the fiddle url to test in IE8

[17:50:58] <wer0ckz> <shoky> or... download a real browser <- all my viewers and users are using IE8 this is something like a call center tool
[18:09:31] <deitarion> If $(this) references a <table>, what's the best way to find() all descendant <tr> elements that aren't members of a nested table? (In other words, how do I select "Only descendant <tr> elements that belong to THIS table"?)
[18:12:09] <deitarion> So far, the only thing I can think of is doing find('tr') and find('table tr') and then ignoring any results from the former that are also in the set of results for the latter and that still seems inelegant.
[18:13:46] <myndzi> isn't there a .filter?
[18:13:57] <myndzi> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:14:14] <deitarion> myndzi: True. I'm still trying to figure out how to apply something like :not() in this context.
[18:14:38] <myndzi> well
[18:14:42] <myndzi> now that i read the whole thing
[18:14:50] <myndzi> if you only want children, use .children
[18:14:56] <myndzi> or a selector with 'immediate descendant'
[18:15:00] <myndzi> like 'table > tr'
[18:15:09] <myndzi> but you could also select on ':not(selector)'
[18:15:32] <myndzi> $(this).children('tr') seems simplest though, assuming that you don't have tbody tags etc in the way
[18:15:44] <deitarion> myndzi: I may. That's part of the problem.
[18:15:46] <myndzi> but you could also do .children('tbody>tr')
[18:16:27] <myndzi> happen to have a fiddle or something?
[18:17:17] <deitarion> I'm rewriting the accordion table plugin for http://gbindex.ssokolow.com/stories/31 and I'm trying to fix up the code which adds the "click to expand" tooltips so they don't also get added to the "Known Incidents" table inside the expander.
[18:18:23] <deitarion> Note: The rewrite is partially done. Hence why you have to click the links but the tooltips are added to everything. The tooltip code is from before I added the option to say bind_row=false when initializing.
[18:18:42] <myndzi> sure, so what are you trying to select specifically?
[18:19:03] <myndzi> like, give me some classes or something to work with :P
[18:19:05] <myndzi> dats a lot of table
[18:19:24] <myndzi> oh nevermind, i had it backwards
[18:19:28] <myndzi> 'known incedents' was on top
[18:19:52] <deitarion> It's supposed to match every row in the outer table but not the ones on the table within the colspan'd row.
[18:19:56] <myndzi> is there some reason you can't just put them under different parents?
[18:20:07] <deitarion> What do you mean?
[18:20:07] <myndzi> in before table not for layout
[18:20:10] <myndzi> i mean
[18:20:21] <myndzi> <div class="known-incedents"><table>...</table></div>
[18:20:32] <myndzi> <div class="list of stuff"><table>...</table></div>
[18:20:37] <myndzi> then you could select them separately
[18:20:40] <myndzi> that'd be the best way
[18:20:47] <myndzi> or even just table class="whatever"
[18:20:52] <myndzi> just don't have one be a subset of the other
[18:21:07] <deitarion> Nope. That'd defeat the whole point. Make sure you have Javascript enabled and then try clicking one of the links in the outer table.
[18:21:20] <myndzi> oh blah, sorry
[18:21:25] <myndzi> i thought i was looking at a header
[18:21:28] <myndzi> okay, now i see what's going on
[18:21:56] <deitarion> My plugin implements something similar to jQuery UI Accordion but for tabular data.
[18:22:12] <myndzi> $('.accordion-table').find('tbody>tr,tr')
[18:22:20] <myndzi> that'll take care of whether or not there's a tbody tag
[18:22:25] <myndzi> though
[18:22:36] <myndzi> it'll be better to give the trs you want to target their own clas sname
[18:22:38] <deitarion> myndzi: I think you mean .children('tbody>tr,tr')
[18:22:40] <myndzi> dunno why i didn't go there first
[18:22:49] <myndzi> deitarion: yeah, sorry
[18:23:03] <myndzi> but still $('.tooltip-row') is better ;)
[18:23:07] <myndzi> selectors go right to left
[18:23:14] <myndzi> so if you do anything that ends in tr it's going to start by selecting ALL trs
[18:23:16] <myndzi> and you have a lot of them
[18:23:23] <myndzi> a lot that you don't want to select, i mean
[18:24:27] <deitarion> myndzi: I don't think you understand. I'm attaching a tooltip to every row except the details expander. If I knew a way to say "but not here" for the expander and the header, I'd attach it to the <table> element when bind_row=true.
[18:24:40] <myndzi> i'm not sure YOU understand :P
[18:24:58] <myndzi> i'm suggesting that when you construct the html, you add a class to the specific tr elements that you want to attach to
[18:25:02] <myndzi> that would be the best way
[18:25:29] <deitarion> For $('.tooltip-row') to work as intended, I'd have to add that class to n-1 of n rows in the table.
[18:25:32] <myndzi> but my understanding is that since the details expander is a table inside the other table, you want to essentially select "all direct child trs of the outside table"
[18:25:47] <myndzi> so .children('tbody>tr,tr')
[18:26:13] <deitarion> Probably best. One sec while I try it.
[18:29:22] <deitarion> Oh, yeah. That's why I wasn't using .children(). It doesn't work with tbody>tr.
[18:29:30] <myndzi> oh huh
[18:29:43] <myndzi> how about find('>tbody>tr,>tr')
[18:30:11] <deitarion> find() doesn't seem to work when it starts with a direct child selector.
[18:30:25] <myndzi> so why can't you do it the proper way?
[18:30:39] <deitarion> myndzi: Which way was "the proper way"?
[18:30:50] <myndzi> add a class directly to the html items you want to select
[18:30:59] <deitarion> myndzi: Two reasons:
[18:31:29] <deitarion> 1. As I said, it'd require adding that class to all but one row in the table. (Sort of like adding "not-me" as a class to every HTML tag on the page except one)
[18:32:15] <deitarion> 2. I'm trying to make this plugin more generic and reusable. It's bad enough that I may have to make <tbody> mandatory.
[18:33:52] <myndzi> using a class would make it more reusable
[18:33:58] <myndzi> it's easy to add that class to all but one row
[18:34:13] <myndzi> also
[18:34:20] <myndzi> you could put the known incedents table INSIDE the tr
[18:34:23] <myndzi> instead of amidst it
[18:34:27] <myndzi> which would alleviate that problem too
[18:34:33] <myndzi> er, well, the 'details' row
[18:34:48] <deitarion> myndzi: I have no idea what you mean by "inside the tr". It's in a colspan'd <td>. It's already inside the <tr>.
[18:34:58] <myndzi> i mean as its own table
[18:35:01] <myndzi> or div or something
[18:35:10] <myndzi> you have "a bunch of trs and then one that's different"
[18:35:12] <deitarion> It IS its own table. It's just a table inside another table's cell.
[18:35:19] <myndzi> when you could have "a bunch of trs that are the same and one contains something else"
[18:35:36] <deitarion> That IS what I have.
[18:35:47] <myndzi> the details tr is in with the others
[18:35:54] <myndzi> it's the one you would have to add the class to "everything but"
[18:35:57] <myndzi> yes?
[18:35:57] * deitarion is frustrated.
[18:36:11] <myndzi> i'm looking at the dom and i see
[18:36:12] <deitarion> Never mind. I'll just figure out how to do a set difference operation on two jQuery objects.
[18:36:14] <rmill> Wait, back it up, you JUST want to find the top layer of tr's
[18:36:24] <rmill> and not go into any sub tables? jeah?
[18:36:30] <myndzi> tr class, tr class, tr class, tr class, tr class, tr class="expanded", tr id="details" class="details"
[18:36:47] <myndzi> there are two trs that are different from a hundred others
[18:37:10] <myndzi> i'm saying don't do that
[18:37:13] <deitarion> myndzi: class="expanded" is irrelevant to this problem.
[18:37:23] <myndzi> okay
[18:37:24] <myndzi> good luck then
[18:38:21] <CausaMortis> Any idea why a phonegap application using jquery mobile and the following code results in a listview without styling? http://jsfiddle.net/5LjRd/
[18:38:22] <deitarion> myndzi: I suspect it's just .find('tr:not(.details)').not($scope.find('table tr')). Let me check.
[18:38:37] <myndzi> there's two ways to solve a problem that's difficult
[18:38:41] <myndzi> one is to make it a problem that's easy
[18:38:46] <myndzi> and the other is to come up with a difficult solution
[18:38:54] <myndzi> i'm trying to point you at the first but you're demanding the second
[18:39:19] <deitarion> myndzi: Because the solution you keep giving does not meet the requirements.
[18:39:29] <rmill> LOL
[18:39:35] <rmill> What are the requirements, again?
[18:39:36] <myndzi> i'm giving you ideas man, i haven't parsed all your code
[18:39:52] <myndzi> if you make it something bite sized it would be easier for me to give you exact details
[18:40:07] <deitarion> rmill: Matching rows in the parent table but not the nested table WITHOUT adding a class to n-1 or n rows in the parent table.
[18:40:24] <myndzi> rmill: far as i can tell, he wants to select all the trs belonging to the outside table but not the trs belonging to the sub-tables inside them
[18:40:30] <myndzi> and he doesn't want to do this by giving them class names-
[18:40:37] <rmill> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSpbF/
[18:40:42] <rmill> Like that?
[18:40:42] <deitarion> myndzi: My solution works. Just tried it. This --> $scope.find('tr:not(.' + o.expander + ')').not($scope.find('table tr'))
[18:41:19] <myndzi> i didn't say it wouldn't work, i said it was the wrong way to solve a problem :P
[18:41:35] <myndzi> rmill: add a tbody and see what happens
[18:41:41] <deitarion> myndzi: Depends on the problem you're trying to solve. This is supposed to be a drop-in plugin requiring minimal or no changes to the HTML.
[18:42:12] <myndzi> well, you can make a drop-in plugin that works with good html or a drop-in plugin that works with bad html :P
[18:42:23] <myndzi> or you could, i dunno, use javascript to set up and help you out
[18:42:35] <deitarion> myndzi: I consider it bad HTML to attach a class to n-1 of n rows.
[18:42:51] <myndzi> i consider it bad html to have n-1 rows in the first place
[18:42:56] <myndzi> :P
[18:43:03] <rmill> myndzi: tbody's are implied.
[18:43:26] <myndzi> rmill: but they interfere with the .children selector, yes?
[18:43:30] <deitarion> rmill: He's saying that your .children()-based solution will break if the HTML uses <tbody>.
[18:43:33] <rmill> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSpbF/1/ still works even with tbody tags.
[18:44:00] <rmill> tbody is there in your DOM even if you don't have it in markup.
[18:44:12] <myndzi> dom and markup don't always match the same
[18:44:15] <myndzi> i think i'm thinking of css though
[18:44:24] <rmill> :|
[18:44:38] <rmill> I didn't have any tbody in my markup
[18:44:48] <deitarion> rmill: Oh, wait. I didn't notice your table  was equivalent to $scope.children('tbody') on my end.
[18:44:50] <myndzi> i'm a bit surprised to see .children operate that way
[18:44:51] <rmill> but the selector '#wat > tbody' still worked...
[18:45:23] <myndzi> dunno, i know that i've had html changes from implied to explicit dom elements break formatting
[18:45:37] <myndzi> i'll have to check out exactly what the situation is next time

[19:12:32] <leaetmika> @coldhead thanks almost what i want , i want first to set the image outside of the window but without animation
[19:13:22] <S1r1usBl4ck_1> Repeating my question because I am not sure if it went through - stupid net issues. I am trying to compose a new jquery widget from existing jquery widgets. I couldn't find any way to accomplish that. Any ideas how one can go about that?
[19:28:28] <coldhead> leaetmika: http://jsfiddle.net/Q5Y3j/3/ ?
[19:31:08] <leaetmika> @coldhead yes exactly thanks , just one question the image that i am trying to animate is not at the center can i set first a variable to memorize the position of the image then animate to that same position ?
[19:32:25] <coldhead> sure you can
[19:33:40] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/Q5Y3j/4/
[19:35:05] <leaetmika> @coldhead amazing thanks a lot for your help
[19:52:32] <CausaMortis> Anyone here that was bold enough to write a phonegap application using jQuery Mobile? I'm trying to setup a simple phonegap container that executes different json requests (remote webserver) depending on the page that is displayed. I managed to fetch the data in all sorts of ways (making use of jQuery Mobile's ajax navigation system to hijack the url and turn it into an AJAX call, working with $(docu
[19:52:32] <CausaMortis> ment).delegate and following one of the tutorials linked in the documentation (this last one to no avail, alas)). The first two I am able to fetch the data and add it to my html, however phonegap seems to be preventing jquery mobile from applying its styling. Any thoughts on this bizar way of writing a mobile application? Any decent resources laying around that you could point me to? Suggestions? Ple
[19:52:38] <CausaMortis> ase help a brother out.
[19:55:01] <ryorky1> I have the following code:  	$('tr#dirrow').on("mouseenter",function(){dir = "#parent"+$(this).attr('data-tt-id'); $(dir).show();  this works in most situations, however, when a new element is dynamically loaded, i.e. using jquery, my event no longer works.  Any ideas on how to resolve the problem?	
[19:59:25] <ryorky1> hello
[20:08:21] <delco> Hello, is it possible to make the textare detect ^word and automatically color it then return back to default color ? so if someone types ^ + word it would turn green for example
[20:10:46] <mike_b_f> Hrm... Maybe use a content-editable <p> with a border.
[20:13:02] <delco> having one text area over some div does not work to well because there is all kinds of problems when the user types something and then goes to the next line, and never lines up
[20:13:32] <paxcoder> can't queue be chained to a previous fadeIn?
[20:17:51] <delco> coldhead
[20:18:41] <CausaMortis> phonegap + jQuery Mobile, who is the godly man or women that can show me a working example of this fiasco?
[20:19:05] <CausaMortis> I have lost too many precious nights sleep over it :o please help a brother out
[20:23:49] <paxcoder> CausaMortis|zZz, why would it be a fiasco?
[20:24:03] <CausaMortis|zZz> paxcoder, pretty much every phonegap developer advises against it
[20:24:35] <CausaMortis|zZz> im tried using jquery mobiles ajax navigation system, ive tried the delegate solution
[20:24:37] <paxcoder> CausaMortis|zZz, why? and what'd you use instead?
[20:25:16] <CausaMortis|zZz> well, jquery mobile isnt designed to be some sort of front-end design framework for mobile applications
[20:25:30] <CausaMortis|zZz> its a framework developed for websites
[20:25:51] <paxcoder> ungh, not from what i know about it
[20:25:54] <DRWhite> hi all, I am in need of assistance for JQuery Mobile, is there anyone here that can help?
[20:26:21] <paxcoder> CausaMortis|zZz, it seems to me its primary use case are web apps that want to look like native apps
[20:26:43] <paxcoder> so that plays nicely with PhoneGap's philosophy
[20:27:15] <paxcoder> it's not like i used either, but that's my impression
[20:27:28] <DRWhite> I am doing an ajax call to get data, but the styling for the "switches" as per the scroll version is not working on radio buttons. how can I force an UPDATE of the jquery on it?
[20:27:44] <CausaMortis|zZz> id advise you to read a bit more about it then and perhaps drop by #phonegap. Im not saying you shouldnt use it, im just saying thats the message I keep getting
[20:28:01] <CausaMortis|zZz> I was wondering, if you have written applcations in phonegap with jquery mobile
[20:28:06] <CausaMortis|zZz> you think you could help me out with something?
[20:28:39] <CausaMortis|zZz> Im trying to make my application execute a json request during the pagechange or pageshow method and populate the page
[20:28:49] <CausaMortis|zZz> however, the jquery mobile styling is not applied
[20:29:24] <CausaMortis|zZz> fetching the data works, even when making use of the build in ajax navigation system and paths to my web application
[20:29:43] <CausaMortis|zZz> method = event obviously :)
[20:29:52] <CausaMortis|zZz> sry, ive been up for about 48 hours
[20:29:54] <CausaMortis|zZz> need bed
[20:29:57] <CausaMortis|zZz> soon :o
[20:30:23] <coldhead> why don't you just sleep for a couple of hours and then try again
[20:30:32] <CausaMortis|zZz> paxcoder, if you perhaps have some code you would be willing to share with me that would be awesome
[20:30:42] <ryorky1> is it possible to add events to elements that have been added to a page via ajax?
[20:30:48] <CausaMortis|zZz> coldhead, I was planning on it :) hence the |zZz part
[20:31:02] <CausaMortis|zZz> but figured id ask for some advice before going to bed :)
[20:31:07] <CausaMortis|zZz> put my mind at ease
[20:31:55] <paxcoder> CausaMortis|zZz, you missed where I said I didn't use either. Take coldhead's advice. Rest is all the rage. ;-)
[20:32:23] <CausaMortis|zZz> paxcoder, ah :) my bad
[20:33:12] <CausaMortis|zZz> Will be doing that then. In case anyone feels like sharing a chunk of code or a resource that could prove useful
[20:33:19] <CausaMortis|zZz> please do not hesitate to do so
[20:33:30] <CausaMortis|zZz> either way, take care and thanks for the input
[20:33:34] <delco> can someone tell me why this does not work :/ as i was expecting http://jsfiddle.net/2mLgc/
[20:40:37] <DRWhite> I am doing an ajax call to get data, but the styling for the "switches" as per the scroll version is not working on radio buttons. how can I force an UPDATE of the jquery on it?
[20:56:51] <s5fs> DRWhite: which widget are you using?
[20:57:14] <DRWhite> I'm using JQuery Mobile
[20:57:49] <DRWhite> I'm AJAX loading from another URL
[20:57:54] <s5fs> DRWhite: gotcha. which switch are you using? like a toggle switch or a slider?
[20:58:00] <DRWhite> Placing that returned data into the page
[20:58:07] <DRWhite> Any
[20:58:10] <s5fs> DRWhite: I'm assuming the content you are loading from the ajax call has the radio buttons that won't work, right?
[20:58:14] <DRWhite> I don't care what the style is.
[20:58:42] <DRWhite> It's just appearing as STANDARD HTML style, not as JQuery Mobile layout with the cun tions on them
[20:58:50] <DRWhite> It's just appearing as STANDARD HTML style, not as JQuery Mobile layout with the functions on them
[21:00:05] <DRWhite> I need to know how to re-initialise the JQuery to act upon those fields
[21:01:11] <s5fs> DRWhite: assuming you were using a slider, you could try $("#myelement").slider()
[21:01:30] <DRWhite> that would work after the AJAX?
[21:01:45] <DRWhite> as in get all the elements, then perform that upon them all?
[21:03:28] <s5fs> DRWhite: I think so, should be quick to test.
[21:03:38] <s5fs> just throw it in after the ajax call finishes.
[21:03:40] <DRWhite> thanks, I'll give it a go
[21:04:33] <s5fs> DRWhite: good luck! also check out api.jquerymobile.com, it's got more detail for each widget. look to see what methods they have, etc.
[21:05:09] <DRWhite> I did look there, have been looknig on there for 3 hours
[21:05:12] <DRWhite> reading everything
[21:05:18] <DRWhite> trying to solve it all...
[21:06:10] <s5fs> DRWhite: yeah, i'm on a documentation readathon right now
[21:08:39] <enerel> what is bootstrap channel name?
[21:09:39] <s5fs> enerel: #twitter-bootstrap maybe?
[21:09:43] <enerel> thanks

[21:24:40] <delco> kborchers i added one ) but i dont see any changes in the code

[21:46:41] <guzzlefry> I'm getting "TypeError: $(...).unwrap is not a function" from $('.image-style1 img').unwrap();
[21:46:51] <guzzlefry> no clue why as the images are wrapped in divs.
[21:47:01] <guzzlefry> and jquery is included.
[21:47:36] <kborchers> delco: not really sure what you were doing there … i would definitely recommend learning some more basic JS before you get to far over your head but here you go http://jsfiddle.net/2mLgc/7/
[21:47:55] * kborchers leaves his soap box and goes to bed :)
[21:48:36] <coldhead> goodnight forever kborchers
[21:48:47] <kborchers> i can only hope
[21:49:08] <coldhead> guzzlefry: do you maybe have some other library that is overwriting $?
[21:49:17] <coldhead> does it work if you replace $() with jQuery() ?
[21:50:15] <marandi> hi , guys , can anyone help me about datatables ?
[21:50:48] <coldhead> it depends what you need
[21:50:53] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[21:51:10] <guzzlefry> coldhead: same error.
[21:52:04] <coldhead> weird
[21:52:05] <delco> kborchers i know i have to learn it, let me see this
[21:52:38] <marandi> coldhead: yea of course , i have a problem with initializing datatable , specifically  when i use sDom property ! i explain it here http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/15497/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-039length039-of-undefined#Item_2, can u help ?!
[21:52:40] <coldhead> guzzlefry: what version of jquery is it?
[21:53:37] <delco> kborchers thank you so much :) your the best
[21:53:49] <coldhead> guzzlefry: http://jsfiddle.net/MLRwU/
[21:53:52] <coldhead> it definitely CAN work
[21:54:25] <coldhead> you're*
[21:55:43] <guzzlefry> coldhead: http://www.kolodinskiart.com/ that's the offending page :P
[21:56:34] <coldhead> marandi: you seem to be using jquery UI options in sdom
[21:56:44] <coldhead> but you are setting bjQueryUI to false
[21:56:55] <coldhead> Default:lfrtip (when bJQueryUI is false) or <"H"lfr>t<"F"ip> (when bJQueryUI is true)
[21:57:06] <guzzlefry> oh, this may be an old version of jquery 0.o
[21:57:11] <coldhead> you have the latter but bJQueryUI: false
[21:57:28] <coldhead> guzzlefry: bam, 1.3.2
[21:57:30] <coldhead> unwrap is in 4
[21:57:34] <coldhead> :(
[21:57:39] <guzzlefry> well that's silly
[21:57:49] <coldhead> it's very sad
[21:57:59] <guzzlefry> isn't it up to 1.7 now? :P
[21:58:01] <marandi> coldhead: im sorry i dont get it , and its not ur fault because i cant understand this value
[21:58:11] <delco> ahh just realized something
[21:58:18] <marandi> coldhead: so what should i do now ?
[21:58:38] <guzzlefry> oh, 1.9
[22:00:01] <coldhead> marandi: try changing bjqueryui to true
[22:01:08] <marandi> coldhead: what do u mean by bjqueryui , because i checked and it just had jquery ui header and jquery ui footer !
[22:01:35] <marandi> coldhead: i found nothing called bjqueryui
[22:02:25] <guzzlefry> looks like a typo
[22:05:50] <delco> if someone could take a look at this it almost works just the problem is.. it wont change the color back to black after writing the link http://jsfiddle.net/2mLgc/8/
[22:05:55] <coldhead> line 2 of the first code snippet here: http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/15497/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-039length039-of-undefined#Item_2
[22:06:03] <coldhead> for god's sake, work with me here marandi
[22:06:35] <coldhead> LINE TWO OF THE FIRST THING IN A BUNCH OF CODE YOU WROTE
[22:06:40] <coldhead> HELEN KELLER COULD HAVE FOUND THIS
[22:07:06] <marandi> coldhead: :O im so sorry ! i thought were still talking about sDom
[22:07:16] <marandi> coldhead: sorry again man , let me chek
[22:08:12] <coldhead> It's perfectly simple. If you're not getting your hair cut, you don't have to move your brother's clothes down to the lower peg. You simply collect his note before lunch, after you've done your scripture prep, when you've written your letter home, before rest, move your own clothes onto the lower peg, greet the visitors, and report to Mr. Viney that you've had your chit signed.
[22:09:23] <marandi> coldhead: still got that error ! ( i change bJqueryUI to true in initializing )
[22:10:51] <coldhead> marandi: if you look at the docs for sDom here http://datatables.net/usage/options
[22:10:55] <coldhead> which is ALL I AM DOING
[22:11:15] <coldhead> the value you have for sDom is the default
[22:11:20] <coldhead> when jQuery UI is included
[22:11:28] <coldhead> so try removing that line entirely and use the default
[22:11:52] <coldhead> it may not even be the cause of your error but it's not right
[22:12:54] <delco> coldhead for how long can you stay on ?
[22:14:08] <marandi1> coldhead: sorry i disconnected ,  still got that error ! ( i change bJqueryUI to true in initializing ) !
[22:15:12] <coldhead> marandi1: you make me feel so tired
[22:15:43] <marandi1> coldhead: im not good at jquery , sorry !
[22:16:07] * unCork pours coldhead a cup of coffee
[22:16:24] <coldhead> marandi1: i would try to simplify things until it works, then add back whatever you need http://jsfiddle.net/XrSXh/
[22:16:39] <coldhead> cheers uncky unCork
[22:16:41] <marandi1> coldhead: alright !
[22:16:48] <marandi1> coldhead: sounds perfect
[22:16:55] <coldhead> i would also try heroin
[22:17:00] <coldhead> under the right circumstances
[22:20:47] <coldhead> tell the story that you donnnnn't lovvvve meeeee
[22:22:30] <delco> coldhead?
[22:23:42] <coldhead> wat
[22:24:24] <coldhead> delco: it goes back to black for me when i backspace
[22:24:27] <coldhead> i don't understand
[22:24:36] <rohdef> I just fell over a blog claiming that with HTML5 I don't need $(document).ready(...) if I place my scripts in the bottom of the page. Is this true?
[22:24:51] <delco> hmm
[22:24:58] <coldhead> technically true, rohdef
[22:25:03] <coldhead> also for older html
[22:25:07] <delco> you think the browser could have affect on it ?
[22:25:07] <coldhead> but it's still a good idea
[22:25:28] <coldhead> having it does no harm and lets you move your scripts safely
[22:25:29] <rohdef> coldhead, ok, how come?
[22:25:40] <rohdef> ah makes sense
[22:25:43] <coldhead> because by the time the browser gets to the <script>s the doc is loaded
[22:25:48] <coldhead> so it's "ready"
[22:26:01] <coldhead> possibly delco
[22:26:05] <coldhead> where is it not working for you?
[22:26:14] <marandi1> coldhead: ok everything works great , except table style !
[22:26:23] <delco> as soon as i type http:// everything turns red
[22:26:40] <delco> when i make a space it does not turn black but everything turns in red
[22:26:49] <rohdef> coldhead, thanks :)
[22:27:49] <Cork> delco: what turns red?
[22:27:50] <coldhead> delco: http://jsfiddle.net/2mLgc/9/
[22:27:56] <coldhead> maybe you want ^ and $ ?
[22:28:09] <coldhead> marandi1: i don't know anything about style, sorry
[22:28:09] <Cork> ah, regex
[22:28:14] <coldhead> two problems
[22:28:27] <marandi1> coldhead: its alright , i just want to make it right !
[22:28:50] <marandi1> coldhead: i dont have that sDom right now , and when i uncomment that line , i got error
[22:30:28] <coldhead> so that line is probably wrong
[22:30:37] <coldhead> i think the style problem probably relates to jquery UI
[22:30:43] <coldhead> maybe you need to inclde the jQuery UI CSS?
[22:32:19] <delco> coldhead yeah almost , see thats why i always had problem with js because its so hard to make something to work and you have to test something on many ways : now like i said almost works but the problem is if you start writing regular text and then the link it then the link wont turn red
[22:33:16] <marandi1> coldhead: i did  ! another things that weird about it is : when i use initializing without bServerSide , bProccessing and sAjaxSource and sServerMethod ( i mean when i use the static datas ) everything works wonderfull with even with bJqueryUi : false and previous sDom property but in ajax method i got error
[22:37:02] <coldhead> delco: if you want JUST the link in the <textarea> to appear in red, i am sorry, that's not possible
[22:37:13] <coldhead> text color is all or nothing in <textarea>s
[22:38:22] <khmer> hey so, let's say that some handsome guy you know was writing an SDK for dealing with raw API objects
[22:38:31] <khmer> and he's designing the collection interface
[22:38:44] <khmer> which would you prefer: an array-like object similar to jquery, that you can loop through but that isn't a "real" array
[22:39:06] <khmer> or an object with an "items" property that is a literal array, and a bunch of methods on the object that proxy array methods, so you never have to touch the .items array and it's essentially private
[22:39:23] <khmer> using a plain array isn't an option, because you need metadata on the thing, like paging params
[22:39:55] <Cork> khmer: as long as it can be used in a loop it doesn't really matter
[22:40:10] <khmer> Cork: well, the latter usage would have a .each method
[22:40:26] <khmer> the former could, but wouldn't really need one since you could use it in a plain for loop, or call Array.prototype.forEach on it
[22:40:30] <Cork> i meant ex for(obj in objs)
[22:40:54] <Cork> or for(var v;v;v++)
[22:41:08] <khmer> Cork: we're talking about iterating through array indices, not object props like a for-in
[22:41:22] <delco> coldhead yeah i kinda thought of that cuz textarea was not mean to be for that
[22:41:28] <Cork> khmer: and that would be the second loop yes
[22:42:03] <khmer> Cork: so the first, you could directly use that loop on. the second, you couldn't--you'd have to use an accessor to get to the real array, or call a .each method on it
[22:42:05] <Cork> khmer: my point is preferably you should not force the user to not use the built in features of javascript
[22:42:08] <coldhead> delco: you could either use contenteditable
[22:42:09] <delco> thanks for the hep anyway cuz it was close
[22:42:15] <coldhead> to give you a "rich" textarea
[22:42:18] <coldhead> like twitter does
[22:42:31] <coldhead> OR you could pull the URL and display it somewhere else in whatever color you want
[22:42:32] <coldhead> maybe
[22:42:38] <coldhead> both options are some trouble
[22:42:46] <Cork> khmer: to make the original object loopable isn't hard
[22:42:54] <delco> yes i see
[22:43:05] <delco> im gonna see what i can do, going to sleep soon
[22:43:19] <Cork> khmer: var o = { 0:'a', 1:'b', length: 2 };
[22:43:22] <delco> probably gonna talk to you tomorrow or the next day
[22:43:23] <khmer> Cork: i didn't ask if it was hard, gorgeous, i asked which you'd prefer
[22:43:26] <delco> depend on the work
[22:43:28] <Cork> just add a length to your object and it's done
[22:43:31] <khmer> Cork: sounds like the former :)
[22:43:57] <Cork> khmer: there is really no need to over architect it like java normally like to do (for example)
[22:44:28] <khmer> Cork: well, these objects extend a prototype that has its own sync methods with a server, like backbone models
[22:44:47] <khmer> Cork: so there's already CRUD methods on them
[22:44:47] <Cork> so?
[22:44:56] <Cork> sure and?
[22:45:03] <khmer> Cork: so it's already pretty architected
[22:45:20] <Cork> comparing to have an array like object you can just loop
[22:45:32] <Cork> to haveing an object with next prev and an item
[22:45:49] <khmer> nah, not like a java iterator
[22:45:50] <Cork> the later is over architected
[22:46:14] <Cork> ah, that was the feeling i got from your initial explanation
[22:46:18] <khmer> i do take your point, though, you'd prefer the array-like method, so, point in your corner
[22:46:26] <coldhead> really looking forward to that delco
[22:46:27] <Cork> then if it's just moving it one step it, it doesn't really matter
[22:46:39] <khmer> Cork: look at Ext.MixedCollection for an example of the second approach
[22:46:52] <khmer> http://dev.sencha.com/playpen/docs/output/Ext.util.MixedCollection.html
[22:47:04] <Cork> khmer: ext is very much java sadly
[22:47:16] <Cork> it tries REALLY hard to reinvent java in javascript
[22:47:38] <Cork> and is one of the reasons i don't like extjs at all
[22:48:06] <khmer> it does a lot of nice stuff well, though--some of its decomps are stupid, like compositeelements and floating,and some of them are really great, like stores and proxies and operations
[22:48:11] <Cork> hack if you check in it's editor a few versions back you even wrote the code for the site in java
[22:48:17] <Cork> and it compiled it to javascript -_-'
[22:48:29] <khmer> oh yeah, never that stuff
[22:48:33] <khmer> no sencha designer, no GWT
[22:48:33] <Cork> khmer: yes, the ui is nice, it's code; not so much
[22:48:42] <khmer> but writing JS directly in Ext is kinda nice after a while
[22:48:50] <Cork> and extending there frameworks is hard like hell
[22:48:58] <Cork> (the second thing that made me hate it)
[22:49:08] <khmer> every time you think "oh man this thing is so stupid and heavy, i'm gonna reimplement this to be all Simple and HTML5 and Modular cause i'm a Node Person"
[22:49:25] <khmer> five commits later you've rewritten all the stuff they wrote, and worse, with no tests
[22:49:35] <Cork> :)
[22:49:38] <lemonsparrow> I have my submit button on click function now within the document ready. https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379 when I move it out of the document ready function, then the submit function does not work... what is the best way to handle this submit function outside of document ready function ?
[22:50:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: add a form and use the submit event on the form instead
[22:51:07] <Cork> you're breaking browser features without forms
[22:52:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok but idealy even if I put the onclick outside of document ready it should  work provided I click the button after the DOM loads ryt ?
[22:52:32] <Cork> no
[22:52:44] <Cork> well it depends on where you add the code to the page
[22:53:05] <Cork> if you add it to the head it will run before the element exist, so it won't match anything
[22:53:16] <Cork> so no click event will be added
[22:54:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I added it to the last :)
[22:54:51] <Cork> to the last what?
[22:55:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that means even after the document ready block..
[22:55:47] <Cork> that means it would run directly when your script section is parsed (inline or as an external resource)
[22:56:05] <Cork> and if that is in the head body would be empty
[22:57:17] <lemonsparrow> https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379 Cork like this !!
[22:57:35] <Cork> yes and if that is linked in the head of your html file
[22:57:49] <Cork> $('#pub') would run directly when the page starts to load
[22:58:00] <Cork> and the section in ready would run when the content has been parsed
[22:58:10] <Cork> so $('#pub') wouldn't match anything
[22:58:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what is differnce b/w "page starts to load" and "content has been parsed" what content ?
[22:59:09] <Cork> the browser starts to parse the html as it comes in
[22:59:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I have my js code outside of html in a separate js file..
[22:59:38] <Cork> it hits the header section and finds the link (css) links pauses the parser and download the css files
[22:59:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and I am not  using any form in my html
[22:59:50] <Cork> then if finds the script sections and fetches external files and parses them
[22:59:55] <Cork> then it gets to the body section
[23:00:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am using DWR for ajax
[23:00:23] <Cork> if thats the matter ready means even less
[23:00:29] <Cork> or makes it even harder
[23:00:37] <Cork> cause ready will trigger before the content exists
[23:01:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you need to wait for a callback from dwr to know the content has been loaded
[23:01:26] <Cork> before that selectors won't match anything
[23:01:36] <Cork> (as the content isn't there yet)
[23:01:55] <coldhead> https://twitter.com/WarrenBuffett/status/329993701524918272
[23:01:56] <b-ot> coldhead: @WarrenBuffett: Warren is in the house.
[23:03:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok since I have all my DWR calls inside document ready.. I believe I will have all the data by the time the page is ready/loaded ?
[23:03:50] <Cork> no
[23:04:00] <Cork> not if you load your content through ajax
[23:04:13] <Cork> dom ready does nothing for that user case
[23:04:41] <Cork> dom ready triggers exactly once per initial page load
[23:05:12] <Cork> and it is when the document has been parsed to the </body> tag
[23:05:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so u mean to say the code is wrong in a way ? actually all my dwr calls are inside document.ready but dwr method defintions outside document.ready
[23:05:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i say that if you're loading things through ajax, dom ready won't help you
[23:06:12] <Cork> dom ready isn't meant to use with ajax
[23:06:24] <Cork> it
[23:06:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and DWR is ajax :)
[23:06:35] <Cork> *'s for use with the initial page load
[23:06:45] <Cork> so you need to use callbacks
[23:07:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok so u mean to say that document.ready works during first page load and not for subsequent page refreshs ? until I clear my cache ?
[23:07:39] <Cork> no
[23:07:49] <Cork> i say it works for when the page loads, not when ajax calls complete
[23:07:58] <Cork> ajax != page loads
[23:08:39] <Cork> ajax is just data sent to the page, what the code in the page does with the data has nothing to do with page load
[23:08:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok i got ur point..
[23:09:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean by the document loads and my ajax data hasnt finished loading yet,,, there could b a delay before I could start using auto complete ? ryt ?
[23:10:10] <eisenheim> Can anyone help with a question right quick?  I am struggling with what I would think should be a simple task.  I am using $.post to send objects to a PHP script. I'm looking for an easy way to convert a form into a javascript object so when PHP gets it it treats it like an array. Is there no built in way to do this?
[23:10:10] <Cork> well it means it is async, so you don't know
[23:10:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: got ur point...
[23:10:42] <Cork> you need to have a callback that tells you when the data has been received and added to the page
[23:11:08] <Cork> else you have a race situation where it might work, and if ex a slow connection happens it breaks
[23:11:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so how can I modify my code here ? https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379
[23:12:10] <Gazpacho> yo dawg i heard u like callbacks so i put a callback in your callback so you can handle events when you handle events
[23:12:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to look at the DWR's api for a way to get a callback from it
[23:12:15] <sacho> eisenheim, whether you "convert a form into a javascript object" or not doesn't really have a bearing to how php will treat your data
[23:12:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and by break u mean.. autocomplete and other ajax validations and update wouldn't work.. there would be a larger delay for things to finsih loading and working ryt ;)
[23:13:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: as in you don't know if the dom element exist when you try to select for it $('selector')
[23:13:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: DWR side is java and all it is sending is array of strings for autocomplete.. to the front end..
[23:13:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ryt
[23:13:37] <Cork> uh...
[23:13:52] <Cork> so, you're not dynamically loading the page through ajax?
[23:13:57] <Cork> (you just said you did...)
[23:14:27] <sacho> eisenheim, if you want to make use of php's magic conversion of parameter groups to arrays, you need to name your parameters accordingly (param[], param[x], etc)
[23:14:58] <Cork> or use json
[23:15:05] <Cork> eisenheim, sacho: ^
[23:16:02] <eisenheim> sacho: if I send an argument using $.post as {key:"val"} PHP treats that as $_POST['key']="val" - I'm trying to use something like serialize() or serializeArray() to get it into that {key:"val"} form
[23:16:24] <eisenheim> or do I just need to write a function to do it?
[23:16:48] <tw2113> eisenheim, are you trying to do that in php? or on the returned value from php?
[23:17:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am dynamically buidling the text fields and all. inside the body tag writing js for it within document.ready block
[23:17:05] <eisenheim> the data that is being sent
[23:17:13] <Cork> eisenheim: $.post(url, { arr: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] }); should works just fine to send an array
[23:17:20] <tw2113> why not just deal with it in php with the $_POST global
[23:17:27] <coldhead> i have an ambiguous dream of you serene surrounded in a sunflower seed
[23:17:30] <Cork> it will be a really long param string but it works
[23:18:11] <enerel> hi guys
[23:18:20] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ok, you have to make sure you have the element added to the page when you try to select it, else it won't work
[23:18:27] <eisenheim> maybe an example will help clarify - I have a php class method that requires an array as a paramater - how would you take the data from a log in form and get it to PHP as an array?
[23:18:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: in short it is an empty body tag and everything I am appending using js inside my document.ready block
[23:18:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and dom ready won't help you at all unless the element is in the original html source
[23:18:47] <Cork> then dom ready won't help you at all
[23:18:53] <tw2113> via the $_POST *array* eisenheim
[23:19:14] <eisenheim> tw2113: how are you collecting the form data?
[23:19:21] <sacho> yes, that would be one way to name your params like that :p
[23:19:29] <tw2113> it's part of the $_POST global
[23:19:34] <tw2113> when you hit submit
[23:20:02] <eisenheim> tw2113: I'm using $.post(); so it's not
[23:20:13] <tw2113> are you checking on the php side?
[23:20:33] <eisenheim> what do you mean?
[23:20:50] <tw2113> in whatever file you're sending your form data to via ajax
[23:21:03] <tw2113> you can check what is in $_POST at that point
[23:21:22] <tw2113> assuming there's anything
[23:21:24] <eisenheim> I'm sending the data as a varaiable through my $.POST
[23:21:56] <tw2113> and yet i say check the $_POST php variable
[23:22:00] <sacho> eisenheim, at this point, explaining what you want to do is less useful than showing your code that attempts to do it.
[23:22:00] <tw2113> not your js variable
[23:22:29] <tw2113> do a print_r() on it and see what shows up
[23:22:44] <eisenheim> tw2113: I know how the php $_POST var works
[23:22:52] <tw2113> is it empty or populated
[23:22:54] <tw2113> after you hit send
[23:23:09] <eisenheim> sacho: there i no code, i'm writing some but I'm trying to think of the best way
[23:23:37] <eisenheim> let me rephrase - how can I turn form data into a javascript object?
[23:23:57] <Cork> eisenheim: you normally don't need to
[23:23:59] <tw2113> i don't think you need to
[23:24:03] <Cork> just use .serialize()
[23:24:12] <tw2113> but i could be wrong
[23:24:24] <eisenheim> Cork .serialize() creates a string - i don't want a string
[23:24:31] <eisenheim> i want to pass an argument
[23:24:36] <eisenheim> that is a javascript object
[23:24:47] <Cork> eisenheim: you have to send a string
[23:24:50] <tw2113> what would php do with a js object
[23:24:54] <sacho> you could use serializeArray, or iterate over the input elements and produce an object yourself
[23:24:56] <Cork> http can only send text
[23:25:27] <Cork> but serializeArray would still be converted to the same thing as serialize() when you send it with $.post
[23:25:59] <Cork> eisenheim: serialize will generate a param string, compatible with what is exepcted by the server
[23:26:17] <bobbobbins> hey, I have a text field that isn't on the page when its loaded, so when i try to set its value using .val once its on the page, nothing happens…any idea how to make that work?
[23:26:18] <Cork> as long as your input fields has the correct names it will just work
[23:26:48] <sacho> bobbobbins, test case please.
[23:26:52] <Cork> bobbobbins: have you verified that the selector finds the field?
[23:27:00] <Cork> $('selector').length > 0
[23:27:09] <bobbobbins> let me try that
[23:27:13] <eisenheim> bobbobbins: you using jquery to set the val after it appears?
[23:27:18] <bobbobbins> yeah
[23:27:35] <eisenheim> ah
[23:27:50] <eisenheim> I can help
[23:27:57] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[23:27:57] <coldhead> great work everyone
[23:28:14] <eisenheim> you need to do $(document).on();
[23:28:39] <Cork> eisenheim: set the value, not bind an event
[23:29:01] <eisenheim> Cork: His issue is that the element isn't being found by jquery because it wasn't there on page load
[23:29:18] <bobbobbins> hmm, it didn't get to the selector length, maybe the function thats called before it is killing it
[23:29:22] <Cork> eisenheim: sure, but on binds events, it doesn't set values
[23:29:55] <Cork> bobbobbins: that might be it
[23:30:49] <eisenheim> Cork: I think he's needing to do $(document).on('click','ele',function(){ $(myTarget).val() }); rather than $(ele).click(function(){ $(myTarget).val()});
[23:31:03] <eisenheim> if it is a dynamically loaded element
[23:31:08] <Cork> eisenheim: and what would trigger the event when the element is added?
[23:31:31] <Cork> the problem isn't about adding an event that sets the value, it about changing the value through code
[23:32:10] <eisenheim> bobbobbins: what event is happening that prompts setting the value?
[23:33:14] <bobbobbins> an on click…that part works fine…Im calling a function someone else wrote in the callback though, and i can see now that their stuff is busted
[23:33:52] <eisenheim> bobbobbins: and when you say that it isn't on the page when it's loaded, you mean the element is later added dynamically right?
[23:34:35] <bobbobbins> yup
[23:34:39] <bobbobbins> but it should work anyway, right?
[23:35:30] <eisenheim> yah it should work fine - the code that someone else wrote is suppose to do what?
[23:36:03] <Cork> bobbobbins: a link or a testcase would help saying what goes on
[23:36:30] <Cork> there might be a code error, it might be something async, or something similar
[23:36:36] <ryez> given "tr > td > div > span > a", assume I have the anchor as 'this', how do I get/select the 'tr' object via jquery?
[23:36:37] <eisenheim> Cork: the browser transmitts it as text sure, but $_POST see's  {name:val, name:val} much different than "name=val&name=val"
[23:37:00] <bobbobbins> their code does some audio stuff…but its returning an error…before I even post a test case, I'll need to get access to their code and fix it, thats probably what the problem is
[23:37:17] <eisenheim> bobbobbins: yah sounds like it
[23:37:55] <bobbobbins> thanks though, just talking about it helped me figure out the problem
[23:38:02] <eisenheim> ryez: you're trying to select the tr?  so like $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent() ? :-)
[23:38:12] <lethjakm1> hey, I want a little pop up box inside of a browser, does jquery supply anything like that?
[23:38:16] <eisenheim> bobbobbins : rubber ducky debugging
[23:38:23] <lethjakm1> I want a box that will say "change title?" and have an input field
[23:38:36] <sacho> eisenheim, if you're trying to pass json to your server script, then use JSON.stringify..
[23:38:39] <bobbobbins> heh, i just heard that term today for the first time, and now i've heard it twice in the same day
[23:38:44] <ryez> eisenheim: yes, but is it possible to avoid that many 'parent()' thing?
[23:38:55] <enerel> when i select calendar check-in the check-out date is automatically select next day but when go back and select another check-in date it does not work sometimes http://jsfiddle.net/tZ4YQ/ please see this
[23:39:16] <eisenheim> ryez: I don't know of a way - sorry
[23:39:29] <sacho> ryez, item.parent('tr')
[23:39:56] <sacho> hmm
[23:39:59] <sacho> or .ancestor
[23:40:16] <enerel> Coldhead: are you free?
[23:40:21] <enerel> Cork:?
[23:40:27] <sacho> ryez, http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:42:25] <ryez> eisenheim, sacho: yes, a.closest('tr') is the one
[23:42:32] <ryez> thank you very much!
[23:42:41] <eisenheim> good find sacho
[23:43:02] <eisenheim> sacho: is there a way to stringify an html form in one line?
[23:44:31] <sacho> JSON.stringify(serializeArray().map(function (item) { // transform to whatever json you wanted or not at all }))
[23:44:46] <tw2113> eisenheim, serialize your form data, pass it through, then use <?php unserialize(); ?> on the other side
[23:44:58] <sacho> ..lol
[23:45:27] <sacho> php's serialize and unserialize methods don't use the urlencoded format
[23:46:07] <tw2113> just throwing thoughts out there
[23:46:12] <enerel> when i select calendar check-in the check-out date is automatically select next day but when go back and select another check-in date it does not work sometimes http://jsfiddle.net/tZ4YQ/ please see this
[23:46:19] <enerel> anyone?
[23:46:45] <eisenheim> sacho: what's the map at the end doing?
[23:48:01] <sacho> it transforms the output of serializeArray() to a form that you want, before you stringify.
[23:48:11] <sacho> pun not intended
[23:48:40] <enerel> when i select calendar check-in the check-out date is automatically select next day but when go back and select another check-in date it does not work sometimes http://jsfiddle.net/tZ4YQ/ please see this
[23:50:16] <anze_031> hi all
[23:53:02] <anze_031> how can we hide radio button on by using html ?
[23:54:17] <Cork> anze_031: radio button on what?
[23:55:17] <anze_031> not on wrong typos i have to hide radio button
[23:55:32] <Cork> display: none; ?
[23:55:38] <tw2113> that'd be css Cork
[23:55:46] <tw2113> he's asking how with html
[23:55:58] <Cork> so add an inline style tag
[23:56:06] <tw2113> but that's still css :D
[23:56:07] <Cork> -tag +attribute
[23:56:10] <Cork> :)
[23:56:20] <Cork> then, no you can't hide it through html
[23:56:25] <tw2113> goal for tonight, make Cork want to punch my face in
[23:56:40] <Cork> tw2113: then you have a LOOOONG way to go
[23:57:12] <Cork> cause i actully find that kind of nit picking fun
[23:57:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this is how it is now.. loading text field and submit button using js with document.ready and also invoking dwr method inside document.ready and also submit click method inside document.ready https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379
[23:58:26] <tw2113> night is young
[23:58:42] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then ya that would work, as you append them before you try to access it
[23:59:08] <Cork> lemonsparrow: though, like i said before, you should be using a form around that
[23:59:35] <Cork> simplest would prob be to just replace the div in the buildSiteID function with a form
[23:59:35] <anze_031> Is there have no way to hide radio button by using html ?
[23:59:57] <Cork> anze_031: html is for markup, style should be done in css
