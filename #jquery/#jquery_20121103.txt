[00:25:28] <bythenumebrs> Hello, who do I need to talk to help develop jquery? I am a new developer looking to contribute to some opensource projects.
[00:34:58] <awc737> you need ta talk ta frankie
[00:35:15] <awc737> tellem bobby sent ya
[00:36:11] <awc737> ya* need ta
[00:40:44] <awc737> by the way, big huge thanks to whoever helped me by creating this
[00:40:50] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9sp
[00:41:05] <awc737> you cleaned and reworked a lot of stuff
[00:42:42] <Eviltwin> I'm going to take credit even though I didn't actually edit it
[00:43:04] <awc737> Eviltwin, you made this one I believe
[00:43:16] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9qX
[00:43:23] <awc737> with the deferreds
[00:45:56] <awc737> anyway you helped a lot yesterday Eviltwin with your jsfiddle and links, I combined it all and got a pretty nice working script I think http://paste.laravel.com/9tz
[00:46:33] <Eviltwin> Congrats
[00:46:35] <Eviltwin> Looks good
[00:47:05] <awc737> thanks, i somewhat understand deferreds and callbacks now... which is saying a lot to where i was
[00:47:18] <awc737> although callbacks seem to get even crazy as you go on
[00:47:20] <awc737> like with node.js
[00:48:22] <awc737> now must pass out, thanks
[01:00:20] <batdorf> is $(window).outerWidth() supposed to return 0 when a page is first loaded? As opposed to a refresh?
[01:31:06] <thinkerweb> hi, jquery mobile in alpha or beta?
[02:29:44] <ItsJustMe> Hey there .. :) I think I've got a relatively small problem .. I pass an input value and echo it with php. If someone types in "Blah._." everything's fine, but if there's a space like "Blah ._." jquery says: "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ._. @ http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js:4679". What to google for?
[02:30:45] <ItsJustMe> Every search results told me something like [@name=required], but no one explains my problem ..
[02:45:27] <CFUDev> Hello . . .
[02:48:28] <maloik> Any tips for a searchbox which gives suggestions from a remote source (AJAX API, to search movies) but also work's on mobile? Select2 didn't seem to like iOS very much
[03:04:05] <ItsJustMe> found a solution :D
[03:04:10] <ItsJustMe> escape(); xD
[03:04:14] <ItsJustMe> cu ^^
[03:05:26] <CFUDev> Can anyone help with that ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13208086/jquery-run-a-plugin-only-when-that-is-required-by-a-variable
[03:06:48] <tintin> In imgur.com or some other website, in facebook.com too , if you scroll down it the page down or other data will be displayed
[03:06:59] <tintin> loaded new page/data
[03:07:05] <tintin> new images
[03:07:14] <tintin> automatically loaded new images
[03:07:40] <tintin> How can it be controlled like if you  click a button it will display the next page data/images
[03:07:48] <tintin> So a use can wait
[03:08:04] <tintin> But now it just scrolls down to next page with data/images.
[03:11:10] <Eviltwin> CFUDev: Bottom answer is correct
[03:11:16] <Eviltwin> The one by roXon
[03:14:26] <CFUDev> That's correct Eviltwin :)
[03:14:31] <CFUDev> I using it now :)
[03:14:34] <CFUDev> Thanks :)
[03:23:57] <batdorf> does switching tabs fire a resize event?
[03:24:41] <batdorf> in Chrome
[03:50:11] <anew> https://github.com/adeelejaz/jquery-image-resize anyone using this? it distorts the image when it says it doesnt.... ayone have any ideas
[03:53:55] <anew> ah working now
[05:05:14] <ideaprison> im switch a background on a specific div using eq() but both elements with the class name get their background changed http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/u9HZs/15/ not sure what im doing wrong
[05:17:34] <ravenzz> ideaprison are you sure?
[05:18:00] <ideaprison> i was about to say
[05:18:05] <ravenzz> seems like that the 1st poster background-image is
[05:18:08] <ideaprison> that i dont think its the JS anymore
[05:18:12] <ravenzz> 0.jpg
[05:18:19] <ideaprison> ?
[05:18:25] <ravenzz> and the second one is 1.jpg
[05:21:07] <ideaprison> seems like the new poster is on top of the old one though
[05:21:25] <ravenzz> seems so
[05:21:27] <ideaprison> i think the css is iffy and that once it is put on the page it has 660px height
[05:21:39] <ideaprison> instead of 0 and animating once i add the 2nd class to the wrap
[05:23:43] <aqeel> hi room
[05:23:58] <aqeel> what is the focus code for opera
[05:24:05] <aqeel> .focus() not working
[05:24:47] <aqeel> how can i detect what is having focus in opera
[06:46:27] <IVA> Does anybody see some plugins for creating carousel effect like in Features tab of the new Appstore on iOS 6? Is it made with html/js or it's native Obj-C? Any ideas?
[06:49:37] <ideaprison> i feel like saying its html/js because they pushed the changes of how the main page looked without doing an update for iOS6
[06:49:50] <ideaprison> so nothing changed to the actual app on the phone
[06:50:13] <ideaprison> just like how people on 6.0 and 6.0.1 have the same appstore
[06:50:18] <ideaprison> far as i know..
[07:03:20] <IVA> ideaprison: interesting. all the coverflow carousels i found on the inet are slow on ipad (3rd gen)
[07:03:36] <IVA> ideaprison: so i decided that it's some native code.
[07:03:48] <ideaprison> unless they programmed it in such a way they can allow edits without updating the OS?
[07:04:04] <ideaprison> or had it in there already and enabled it at later time
[07:05:10] <IVA> ideaprison: according to the general lags across the appstore UI it is html/js. because native app won't behave like this (e.g. contacts, ibooks, music etc. that work with rich content as well, but work really smooth)
[07:05:23] <ideaprison> or am i mixing things up, i could remember they updated the appstore with something nice AFTER iOS6 was out
[07:05:41] <IVA> well, probably i'll try to write this plugin by myself.
[07:05:50] <ideaprison> are you working on an app?
[07:06:10] <IVA> they changed AppStore completely with iOS 6. it's black and with new search etc.
[07:06:22] <IVA> ideaprison: no, it's for the website for now.
[07:06:40] <IVA> ideaprison: but it should work on iOS devices as well
[07:57:17] <hugo_moss> hi, im using a jcarousel but for some reason the width is being calculated as too narrow, so it expands to two rows, so when you scroll on the first row, you see empty items, and theyre really on the second row but not visible. anybody know what the problem might be? how can i make it only take one row?
[07:57:47] <hugo_moss> its a horizontal carousel, not vertical
[08:04:50] <eltoro> hi guys, is there any way to set globally UTC() for all dates generated by the app?
[08:06:55] <eltoro> i'm using jquery countdown plugin http://pastebin.com/siDEv34C
[08:07:07] <eltoro> i would like to make it works only with UTC dates format
[08:07:10] <eltoro> is it possible?
[08:08:04] <eltoro> ops sorry wrong link http://pastebin.com/siDEv34C
[08:10:12] <eltoro> no one knows how can i do that?
[08:13:51] <eltoro> seems the world is ended up today in this channel
[08:13:52] <eltoro> :D
[08:13:59] <eltoro> is there anÃ¦one?
[08:19:02] <eltoro> hey hey
[08:19:07] <eltoro> yahoooo
[08:19:09] <eltoro> gooogle
[08:19:18] <paissad> hello guys, i would like to use a red background-color into a textaria for lines having a specific (regex) pattern, how can i do that if possible ? thanks in advance
[08:19:19] <eltoro> damn :/ byeee
[08:19:51] <paissad> basically, i would like to use a red background-color for lines having the word ERROR
[08:19:59] <toothrot> paissad, where are you stuck? use css...
[08:20:06] <StevenCodes22> ^^ Boom
[08:21:19] <zatan> Hey is anyone knows any good plugin which one will do like here http://www.jenjenhouse.com/Empire-Sweetheart-Floor-length-Chiffon--Charmeuse-Holiday-Dresses-With-Ruffle--Beading-020003246-g3246   with mouse over on image thumb change image in tht div ?
[08:21:22] <zatan> Hey is anyone knows any good plugin which one will do like here http://www.jenjenhouse.com/Empire-Sweetheart-Floor-length-Chiffon--Charmeuse-Holiday-Dresses-With-Ruffle--Beading-020003246-g3246   with mouse over on image thumb change image in that div ?
[08:21:58] <paissad> toothrot: okay, i'm in #css currenty, thanks
[08:22:38] <paissad> toothrot: i've been told the following --> CSS can define the style, but you should use JS to parse and assign the class
[08:22:46] <paissad> so ^^
[08:23:14] <paissad> that's kinda obvious, isn't it ?
[08:23:36] <toothrot> agreed.. is why I'm asking where you are stuck?
[08:24:35] <paissad> may someone lead me the way, i'm not good to JS/JQuery, but i just need some lead for the beginning
[08:25:00] <sekyms> Anyone use underscore?
[08:25:15] <sekyms> or know if there is a an underscore irc channel?
[08:25:35] <toothrot> paissad, also (depending on what you meant), you can't really color specific areas of a textarea, all or nothing, i believe
[08:26:29] <sekyms> he could set the text-area to transparent and put a series of divs behind it that were different colors
[08:27:01] <toothrot> yes.. but figuring out the positions of the text inside may be tricky
[08:27:07] <paissad> hmm, thanks anyway
[08:27:11] <sekyms> i didn't see how whole questio
[08:27:14] <sekyms> just what you sai
[08:27:14] <sekyms> d
[08:28:07] <hugo_moss> hey i have a horizontal jcarousel with 13 items, for some reason the width is calculated to be take 7 items, so the remaining 6 is on a second row. so now when i scroll through the first row, it shows missing items ( placeholders above the last few items of the second row). anyone know what the problem might be?
[08:29:05] <hugo_moss> they should all be on one row so i can just scroll horizontally through that row
[08:31:04] <sekyms> i think underscore is going to make my life so much easier
[08:44:07] <StevenCodes22> Hello
[09:06:33] <Kambfhase> ?hi @ bot-t
[09:06:34] <bot-t> bot-t, :)
[09:15:33] <Drager> How can I make this code better? http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/3/ And when it auto-appends I want the value to be Hide from start and not Show.
[09:21:21] <seutje> Drager: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/4/
[09:22:36] <sekyms> ajpiano: you around by any chance?
[09:23:57] <Drager> seutje: I want them to auto append if there are less than 10 <hr>s
[09:24:16] <seutje> Drager: auto-append what?
[09:25:06] <Drager> seutje: The divs with ids
[09:25:10] <Drager> That holds the data
[09:25:39] <seutje> Drager: so u want to append stuff with IDs that are already in the page?
[09:25:50] <Drager> Yes
[09:26:07] <seutje> and this doesn't throw a red flag in your head?
[09:26:30] <seutje> like a voice screaming "OMIGAWD DUPLICATE IDS!!"
[09:26:34] <Drager> Yes
[09:26:39] <Drager> But I have diffrent ids
[09:26:40] <Drager> :P
[09:26:47] <seutje> uhm, ok
[09:26:48] <Drager> Look at my html in the code
[09:26:59] <seutje> I must be misunderstanding then
[09:27:07] <Drager> #result_user #result_news
[09:27:08] <Drager> and so on
[09:27:17] <seutje> yeah, re-append them and u got them twice, no?
[09:27:39] <Drager> What do you mean?
[09:29:29] <seutje> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/XGf97/
[09:30:08] <Drager> Ah yeah
[09:30:42] <seutje> so I think I'm misunderstanding what you mean by automatically append
[09:32:06] <Drager> seutje: Check the result for this; http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/5/
[09:32:51] <seutje> oooh, ok, so u just wanna show them
[09:33:14] <Drager> Yes if the result is less than the count
[09:33:42] <Drager> and you see the problem as well? It says: "Show" when it's "Open"
[09:33:44] <seutje> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/6/
[09:33:58] <seutje> (also added a e.preventDefault() to keep the page from jumping to the top)
[09:34:02] <seutje> oh, right, forgot the label :x
[09:34:09] <duderion> hi guys
[09:34:16] <Drager> seutje: Cool
[09:34:19] <duderion> i have a problem with the scope
[09:35:15] <duderion> http://pastebin.com/VekUzFFq
[09:35:42] <seutje> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/8/
[09:35:43] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ duderion
[09:35:44] <bot-t> duderion, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[09:35:45] <Drager> duderion: Use a better paste pls
[09:35:50] <seutje> could prolly use some more optimization though
[09:36:06] <duderion> :)
[09:36:32] <Drager> seutje: Lovely. Many thanks!
[09:37:08] <shoky> duderion: in short, 'return mailText'  is run much earlier than the .load() callback
[09:37:26] <duderion> ok
[09:37:37] <duderion> if i put the return inside the callback
[09:37:41] <duderion> the return is 'undefined'
[09:37:52] <shoky> wont help, it'll return from the callback function, not from the outer function
[09:38:01] <seutje> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/9/ changed the .click to .on and moved the actual event handler to the actual link :P
[09:38:09] <shoky> you need to do the stuff you want, inside the callback,
[09:38:24] <duderion> k
[09:38:27] <duderion> ill try it again
[09:38:38] <seutje> Drager: btw, the .stop(true, true) is to keep it from tweaking out when some1 spam-clicks, this way, when someone clicks during an animation, it'll jump to the end of the animation and start the next
[09:39:09] <seutje> Drager: there's still an issue with the detection though, cause an element that is busy fading in or out, won't be ":hidden"
[09:39:56] <gnarf> seutje: if you use .toggle() newer jQuery is smart enough to know it WAS hiding and switch to "re-showing"
[09:40:18] <gnarf> seutje: don't even need (true, true) anymore
[09:40:20] <duderion> hm
[09:40:21] <shoky> duderion this is one way to do it: http://pastebin.com/RZyUtud8
[09:40:50] <gnarf> use fadeToggle instead of fadeIn/fadeOut
[09:42:07] <seutje> gnarf: :o
[09:42:18] <Drager> hm
[09:42:20] <seutje> gnarf: well tell Drager!
[09:42:22] <seutje> :P
[09:42:34] <gnarf> just use .stop().fadeToggle
[09:43:04] <seutje> yesterday, I noticed new jQuery doesn't screw up anymore when animating stuff that's display: table; or anything other than block :D
[09:43:41] <Drager> Weird, doesnt work on my site
[09:43:42] <Drager> o,0
[09:43:52] <seutje> what version u running?
[09:44:32] <Drager> 1.8.2
[09:44:36] <seutje> hm
[09:44:43] <shoky> gnarf: remind me please- is there a way in 1.8+ to get a promise for a specific animation? (without creating your own deferred)
[09:45:32] <Drager> seutje: It doesnt hide my div
[09:45:57] <gnarf> shoky: use $.Animation( elem, props, opts ) instead
[09:46:13] <gnarf> that returns the promise
[09:46:53] <shoky> ah. and the call to $.Animation starts the animation?
[09:47:37] <shoky> nm i'll tias. thanks
[09:47:47] <seutje> gnarf, Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/TxDBg/10/ better? :D
[09:48:28] <gnarf> shoky: yeah - the $.Animation is basicaly .fn.animate but it doesn't support the queue param
[09:48:30] <Drager> seutje: That code and code9 wont hide the div but the code8 works
[09:48:40] <shoky> awesome
[09:48:45] <gnarf> $.Animation 's are all queue: false basically
[09:49:34] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L463-479
[09:50:17] <duderion> shoky: works perfect!
[09:50:19] <duderion> thanks alot
[09:50:19] <seutje> Drager: odd
[09:50:23] <jrajav> +100 bounty SO question with nothing close to a decent answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13120672/how-to-ensure-css-hover-is-applied-to-dynamically-added-element/13204126
[09:52:47] <Drager> seutje: Yes and I have no idea why
[10:04:18] <Whirl3d> jrajav, perhaps you should add a class to the image elements that have the fully loaded image and use the hover on those only
[10:05:59] <michi7x7> Hi all! I'm having a problem with - yeah you guessed it - Internet Explorer. Apparently it cancels AJAX-Requests on its own will. I'm following the Requests in IE's debug-window and the problematic (first few) requests are immedeately marked as "(Canceled)". In every other Browser the code works as expected. This is the problematic code: https://gist.github.com/dee792602780b0044ee8
[10:06:18] <michi7x7> Does anyone of you know certain cirumstances which are known to cause this odd behaviour?
[10:06:20] <jrajav> Whirl3d: I have already tried that, but good suggestion
[10:07:30] <jrajav> Whirl3d: Since I posted the question, I actually have found a workaround; it works to add the image to the div containing the thumbnail, then make the class something like 'div.thumb:hover fullimage'
[10:07:43] <jrajav> Which works in my case but it circumvents the issue
[10:07:58] <jrajav> I've submitted a Chrome bug, I'll see where it goes
[10:10:20] <jrajav> Whirl3d: By the way, I think it really is a #css question, because it seems to be an error with browsers' handling of :hover
[10:10:29] <jrajav> The only browser it works correctly in is Firefox
[10:10:48] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/WSDRz/5/ jrajav
[10:11:27] <abjorn> :O
[10:11:39] <Firemonk> Im trying to pass cap.css("margin-top", cap.height() * -1) how can i concatenate px onto the returned value of cap.height() * -1 ?
[10:11:49] <jrajav> Whirl3d: I still see the issue there
[10:12:02] <Drager> seutje: You have no idea?
[10:12:31] <seutje> Drager: not rly, I have no possible way of debugging it, so yea...
[10:12:47] <Drager> seutje: It must be my divs
[10:13:05] <Drager> Because I removed my code and just took the html from the jsfiddle
[10:13:08] <Drager> and that works fine
[10:14:37] <Whirl3d> jrajav, what about getting rid of the anchor element completely: http://jsfiddle.net/WSDRz/7/
[10:15:48] <Drager> seutje: Now I know what the problem is: I have my <a href="#"> in another <div> and in a <h3>
[10:15:58] <seutje> ah
[10:17:36] <jrajav> Whirl3d: I need the anchor, though; the full image should have the same active link as the thumbnail
[10:17:55] <jrajav> I also can't replace the thumbnail with it
[10:18:07] <jrajav> Because the thumbnail is positioned on the page
[10:18:19] <jrajav> But if the full image takes its place and then expands width, it will reflow everything
[10:18:31] <Drager> seutje: What should I use instead of .text() if I want to use images.
[10:21:22] <seutje> Drager: either .html('<img src="..." alt="show/hide" />') or .find('img').attr('src', ...)
[10:25:45] <Whirl3d> jrajav, here's a cool way to do it, though I just read your last comment, so it would take some adjustment.
[10:25:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/WSDRz/8/
[10:27:32] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm unsure why this script isn't grabbing any tags. I have the id of 'cat_aluminum-round' on line 3 of the HTML but I have no idea why it's not grabbing it. Any help would be appreciated: http://jsfiddle.net/ZscaY/1/
[10:29:08] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: elements can only have one ID
[10:29:30] <shoky> hey Whirl3d
[10:29:38] <Whirl3d> jrajav, your orignal url for the thumb appears to have a directory named Cairo_international_stadium.jpg   is this right?
[10:29:47] <Whirl3d> Hey Shoky! What's Up!
[10:29:53] <shoky> kk ;]
[10:29:55] <shoky> sup

[10:30:25] <Whirl3d> Just got out the hospital after a terrible bout with e-coli ...don't get it; it's not pretty.
[10:30:39] <shoky> ouchie, thanks for the tip
[10:30:51] <Drager> seutje: Alright, thank you
[10:34:56] <michi7x7> anyone got info's on my problem?
[10:44:05] <timwis> Hey guys, I have a persistent navbar footer (like a tab bar), and I have one page, "Search" that doesn't have its own button on the navbar - you land there when the button you press doesn't have the search data yet, so the search page should highlight the prevPage button. I can't seem to do this in pagebeforeshow -- it's as if the footer doesn't exist during that event...any idea why?
[10:45:14] <timwis> $("#search :jqmData(role='footer')").length returns 0 inside pagebeforeshow, but returns 1 in pageshow

[11:30:22] <Kambfhase> hm, .css() accepts "+=50"
[11:30:43] <Kambfhase> not sure, if that works with %
[11:30:52] <Kambfhase> you might just have to TIAS
[11:30:59] <FrameFever1> tias?
[11:31:01] <FrameFever1> container.css("left")-= "100%";
[11:31:20] <Kambfhase> container.css("left","-=100%")
[11:33:29] <FrameFever1> Kambfhase: doesnt work
[11:33:34] <FrameFever1> subtract -100 px
[11:33:52] <Kambfhase> m, yeah
[11:40:42] <dblosevn> weird just lost connection usually i have a reason lol
[12:02:35] <e66> how can I added a css rule to an elment?
[12:02:53] <e66> $(elem).css('property', 'value') ?
[12:03:14] <dblosevn> yep @e66
[12:04:06] <dblosevn> e66: make sure to use the javascript equivalent of `property` though
[12:04:25] <e66> yeah
[12:04:38] <e66> I'll just use css('display', '');
[12:04:49] <e66> or css('display', 'block');
[12:04:54] <Kambfhase> dblosevn: that doesnt matter
[12:05:06] <dblosevn> ya i was referring to margin-left vs marginLeft
[12:05:28] <Kambfhase> dblosevn: afaik jQ can deal with both ways
[12:05:46] <dblosevn> thought the - broke things
[12:07:14] <Kambfhase> in plain js, yes.
[12:07:15] <gnarf> works fine - jQuery will camelCase camel-case
[12:07:21] <dblosevn> maybe it was for a diffent method as well, .css may be able to take both i remember having an issue with margin-left in particular in the past but cant rememebr what
[12:07:34] <gnarf> even in { "margin-left": 100, "margin-right": 100 }
[12:08:15] <dblosevn> oh i know what it is you have to quote the key to make it work
[12:08:49] <dblosevn> {margin-left: vs {'margin-left': vs {marginLeft:
[12:11:52] <e66> Is tehre any wayt to run any function async ?
[12:12:15] <Kambfhase> setTimeout( fn, delay)
[12:24:46] <DBordello> I am trying to use jquery to ajax submit a form.  However, it doesn't apepars to be submitting anything
[12:25:01] <DBordello> I am using this example: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/#ajaxSubmit
[12:25:11] <DBordello> It triggers the showRequest, but it is blank
[12:26:53] <codeshah> hey guys, I have a bunch of div elements [a list of them] and only want to show ~10 , and then show more as I scroll down... any jQ plugins to achieve this?
[12:52:38] <FrameFever1> I have a child div, and what to get know what child number is it?
[12:52:42] <FrameFever1> how can I do this?
[12:59:25] <gnarf> ?index
[12:59:26] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[13:42:39] <Kambfhase> is there an easy way of adding an error handler to a $('#div').load() ?
[13:43:14] <butblack> hi
[13:43:17] <gnarf> use ajax instead Kambfhase
[13:43:39] <butblack> I'd like to parse my json and put the name attribute into an array that will be useable by my javascript.. thoughts?
[13:43:40] <gnarf> just put $("#div").html(data); in the success and its basically load
[13:43:40] <butblack> https://gist.github.com/4008656
[13:43:44] <gnarf> ?load
[13:43:45] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:43:58] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:44:28] <Kambfhase> i just want the error.
[13:44:43] <Kambfhase> I Think im gonna go with $('#div').ajaxError().load()
[13:44:50] <gnarf> ajaxerror is global
[13:44:56] <gnarf> it fires for every error
[13:45:15] <Kambfhase> "Attach the event handler to any element:"
[13:45:39] <Kambfhase> ah, kk.
[13:45:42] <Kambfhase> hmmm.
[13:45:45] <gnarf> you can use it
[13:45:50] <gnarf> just dont bind multiples
[13:45:57] <gnarf> its easier prolly to just use $.get
[13:45:58] <gnarf> instead
[13:46:08] <Kambfhase> yeah
[13:46:23] <gnarf> $.get( "url", function( data ) { $("#div").html( data ); }).fail(function(){});
[13:47:02] <Kambfhase> yeah. I'll do that. thx!
[13:47:33] <butblack> any thoughts?
[13:48:33] <Kambfhase> obj.name.value? why the value?
[13:50:45] <butblack> Kambfhase: sickkkk
[14:11:04] <tuv> when i load() a url into a div then append() it to body, everything works (except the div shows up before it's loaded). but if i call the append inside the load's callback, the div never shows up!
[14:12:13] <tuv> d = $('div'); d.load(url, function(){ $('body').append(d); });   -> div never shows up
[14:12:51] <Hopsy> hi I am searching for a script that is doing this: http://forum.jquery.com/viewImage.do?fileId=14737000001588249&forumGroupId=14737000000003003
[14:12:55] <tuv> well, d = $('<div>')
[14:16:12] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[14:16:18] <vrlogrs> need some help: http://199.195.250.119/
[14:16:41] <vrlogrs> im trying to get #filters to show() and hide() as you focus on either one of the two input['text']s on top
[14:16:46] <vrlogrs> wont seem to work
[14:17:17] <Kambfhase> Hopsy: looks like an css transformation to me
[14:17:42] <Hopsy> I am searching for a plugin Kambfhase that supports all browsers :(
[14:17:52] <Kambfhase> http://css3please.com/
[14:18:34] <Kambfhase> vrlogrs: you are doing it wrong
[14:18:38] <vrlogrs> :S
[14:19:09] <Hopsy> Kambfhase: this supports also IE6?
[14:19:16] <vrlogrs> what do you mean Kambfhase?
[14:19:23] <Kambfhase> vrlogrs: you can either move your <script> to the end of the <body> or you need to wrpa your code in jQuery(function(){ ... });
[14:19:31] <Kambfhase> Hopsy: mostly, yeah
[14:19:40] <vrlogrs> oh ok
[14:19:43] <vrlogrs> i can do that
[14:19:50] <vrlogrs> end of the body -- thanks
[14:20:50] <Kambfhase> np
[14:21:18] <vrlogrs> end of the body doesnt work either :S
[14:21:45] <Kambfhase> you mind uploading that version?
[14:22:00] <vrlogrs> i did .. try refreshing
[14:22:22] <vrlogrs> nvm
[14:22:25] <vrlogrs> it's working
[14:22:27] <vrlogrs> thanks :)
[14:22:35] <Kambfhase> you should really not use jQ 1.4.2
[14:22:54] <vrlogrs> i am :S
[14:22:59] <vrlogrs> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
[14:23:18] <Kambfhase> you should really _not_ use jQ 1.4.2
[14:23:39] <Kambfhase> should really _not_ use jQ 1.4.2
[14:23:47] <Kambfhase> really _not_
[14:23:49] <Kambfhase> _not_
[14:23:52] <Kambfhase> ;)
[14:24:01] <vrlogrs> oh sorry ..
[14:24:05] <vrlogrs> what should i use?
[14:24:11] <Kambfhase> 1.8.2
[14:24:20] <Kambfhase> or -latest
[14:25:03] <vrlogrs> updated :) thanks
[14:56:22] <gabrieluk> hi, I have some code that makes a area "sticky". In the first example it works fine, but in  the second example, i have quirks when resizing the window. any help to debug this?
[14:57:07] <tuv> d = $('<div>'); d.load(url, function(){ $('body').append(d); });   -> div never shows up. why?! why?!
[14:57:19] <gabrieluk> first example http://jsbin.com/welcome/43101/edit , second http://jsbin.com/ozafay/2/edit
[14:57:51] <gabrieluk> the problem is that the html markup and the css changes, so the js is always the same.
[14:59:00] <tuv> when i load() a url into a div then append() it to body, everything works (except the div shows up before it's loaded). but if i call the append inside the load's callback, the div never shows up!
[15:00:07] <gabrieluk> i think you need d.hide()
[15:01:09] <razzi> tuv, invesigate the load() function, perhaps it can't work on elements not in DOM.
[15:03:26] <tuv> razzi: d.load(url).appendTo('body') works
[15:04:20] <tuv> gabrieluk: where? why?
[15:05:21] <tuv> oh.. d.load().hide().appendTo(); ?
[15:06:08] <razzi> tuv, try this to be sure that the .load() works ... d = $('<div>'); d.load(url, function(){ console.log('test'); $('body').append(d); });
[15:06:09] <tuv> but why wouldn't the append work in the load callback?
[15:09:28] <black_warlock> hey peeps sup ?
[15:09:58] <black_warlock> how can i setup the mouseout click button ?
[15:10:20] <black_warlock> i have a toggle on click on this button
[15:10:21] <black_warlock> $('button.options').click(function(){
[15:10:38] <black_warlock> how can i let the target close also onmouse out click ?
[15:11:46] <tuv> the callback never gets called, but there is an error in the console: 'TypeError: document.getElementById("searchbar") is null' - how do i find out where is this coming from? firebug shows the line but i can't find out where it's coming from!
[15:12:23] <hamurgerl> black do you mean on lose focus?
[15:13:41] <razzi> tuv, in Chrome it shows the file & line number, probably so too in FF
[15:14:28] <gabrieluk> tuv, sry, i was just guessing really
[15:16:23] <black_warlock> nope
[15:16:41] <black_warlock> i got a button which open a submenu on click
[15:16:56] <black_warlock> the button toggle the sub menu
[15:17:00] <black_warlock> but i wish
[15:17:02] <gabrieluk> hey there, i have a lil mission. my jquery code works with a certain html/css, but when i inserted in actual project(which contains much more html/css), i found some quirks. is there anyone able to help?
[15:17:18] <black_warlock> if i click in any part of the screen that if menu is open it get closed
[15:17:58] <gabrieluk> the code is this http://jsbin.com/welcome/43101/edit
[15:18:30] <black_warlock> gabrieluk you have created some function with duped name
[15:18:46] <gabrieluk> duped name?
[15:19:38] <black_warlock> yes
[15:19:41] <gabrieluk> i think i'm gonna cry, about 2 days i go over this >.<
[15:20:53] <hamurgerl> black: http://api.jquery.com/mouseout/   without looking at specific code, you would call the hidden or hide against the 'dropdown menu'
[15:28:20] <KristofferDarj> I have some links with href=javascript:void(0) that I want to bind to a click event. Is this possible?
[15:28:29] <KristofferDarj> It seems the inline js prevents it.
[15:34:21] <shoky> KristofferDarj: it shouldn't be preventing it..
[15:35:40] <seutje> event should fire before the void is executed afaik
[15:35:47] <KristofferDarj> hmm strange. Wonder what it is then.
[15:36:22] <KristofferDarj> I'm writing a TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey script so I'm not in control of the page. Might be some other event that triggers first perhaps.
[15:38:15] <seutje> KristofferDarj: yea, if some event handler that gets executed before yours calls stopImmediatePropagation on the event, it won't execute consecutive handlers I think
[15:39:56] <KristofferDarj> I'll have a look
[15:40:15] <seutje> KristofferDarj: you could try to re-order the $el.data('events').click array
[15:41:34] <gabrieluk> hi, I'm having some quirks with my code. the code is to make a fixed div in the middle of the page. it works well, but when i resize the browser window to minimum and than enlarge again, the #sticker div is displaced. there's some extra html/css, but i had to insert those to be able to reproduce the issue http://jsbin.com/ozafay/2/edit
[15:42:19] <shoky> $el.data('events') won't work in 1.8+
[15:42:34] <shoky> $._data(el, 'events')
[15:43:06] <gabrieluk> shoky, should i ask this question in css/html? this code above is the one you helped me to do. but when i added the actual html/css i causes the jquery to quirk :(
[15:43:31] <shoky> gabrieluk: that's not a question
[15:44:09] <gabrieluk> the one above it
[15:44:25] <shoky> gabrieluk: btw you should prolly add  'if (!sticky)'  to the beginning of the .resize callback
[15:45:14] <seutje> shoky: oh, right, keep forgetting about that
[15:46:16] <seutje> KristofferDarj: http://jsfiddle.net/FnV3p/2/
[15:46:27] <shoky> gabrieluk: i didn't give you a perfect solution to that.. it's tricky to get just right. why not use a plugin?
[15:47:41] <gabrieluk> shoky, i really apreciate all you did for me, but it is almost done, and i think would be a pitty to throw that code away
[15:48:08] <gabrieluk> i was using first a plugin, but it was so bloated, and was giving the same errors also
[15:50:43] <hamurgerl> seutje, that's some cool code!  I didn't realize you could work with those click events like that.
[15:50:58] <seutje> well it depends who bound the events, of course
[15:51:13] <seutje> I'm sure there's some more robust, fancy shit you can do, but I'm rather sleep-deprived atm
[15:52:25] <gabrieluk> shoky, but if you say that is not worthy, i won't bother you again.
[15:52:28] <hamurgerl> i'm relatively new to jQuery (several months)...  the var $a=$('asdf') is cool... I assume that's faster because jQuery doesn't have to search for asdf each time?
[15:52:46] <tw2113> yeah
[15:52:59] <tw2113> if you're going to use a selector repeatedly, it's a good practice to store in a variable
[15:53:38] <hamurgerl> cool!
[15:54:15] <hamurgerl> I just started messing around with knockout a while back... have you got to play with that?
[15:57:47] <shoky> Gabrielp: i think this is somewhat better- http://jsbin.com/welcome/43449/edit
[15:57:57] <shoky> gabrieluk *
[15:59:34] <shoky> gabrieluk: but you'd need to adjust the way 'stickerTop' is calculated to fit your layout..
[16:00:35] <gabrieluk> shoky, what that means? how should i adjust that?
[16:01:07] <shoky> gabrieluk: right now it's calculating where the bottom of #top is
[16:01:33] <shoky> that's the y-coordinate where the green div should be if it's not sticky
[16:02:52] <gabrieluk> let me copy that code to the new html and see what happens.
[16:09:56] <gabrieluk> shoky, i think i understand what you did. you used the #top div, to make a "roof" for the sticker. something to recalc based on it. something like that, right?
[16:12:13] <gabrieluk> thanks shoky, if i can't make it work now i will just give up, lol
[16:12:38] <shoky> gabrieluk: i calculated where the bottom of #top is, yea
[16:13:46] <shoky> gabrieluk: and i also made all the scroll/sticky checks happen on resize too
[16:14:06] <gabrieluk> nice one bro, you are a pro
[16:14:52] <shoky> just a fiddler
[16:16:13] <tw2113> the js dev went down to georgia?
[16:19:09] <shoky> ;p
[16:21:57] <xboi209> im trying to prepend a div without closing it but i look in the source code and it automatically closes by itself, can anyone explain this?
[16:22:34] <shoky> xboi209: you can't add "parts" of a tag to the DOM. only full elements
[16:23:05] <xboi209> is there any way to get around this though?
[16:23:20] <shoky> yes, add whole tags
[16:23:30] <shoky> you can build up an html string if you want..
[16:23:45] <xboi209> what i was trying to do is add a vertical scrollbar around an element
[16:23:53] <shoky> see ?wrap
[16:23:54] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[16:23:55] <xboi209> so prepend a div with style attribute inside of it
[16:24:00] <xboi209> and then close it later
[16:24:03] <shoky> and/or .wrapInner
[16:24:19] <xboi209> k lemme read this
[16:24:54] <xboi209> oh
[16:24:57] <xboi209> thanks, that works

[19:44:03] <Kitu> if ($(this).html() != $('#ans_active_page_m').html()) work
[19:44:06] <Kitu> but
[19:44:18] <Kitu> if ($(this) != $('#ans_active_page_m')) does'nt work
[19:44:49] <Kitu> strange for me
[19:46:17] <Kitu> it was the problem black_warlock :)

[19:58:37] <enderx86> I'm creating a website that compares sort times for various algorithms (insertion sort, mergesort, etc.) after a user gives the size for a randomly-generated list
[19:58:50] <enderx86> What's the best way to go about this? My idea is to use a jQuery $.ajax call to retrieve a JSON with all the sort times for every algorithm
[19:59:08] <enderx86> The $.ajax call would be to a PHP page, and the PHP would do the algorithm and encode the JSON
[19:59:26] <enderx86> Thoughts?

[20:09:05] <shoky> enderx86: that's fine
[20:09:22] <enderx86> thanks shoky
[20:09:50] <enderx86> I could alternately do everything in javascript, but it seems easier doing the algorithm and time computations in PHP...
[20:10:12] <shoky> depends what exactly you wanna do..
[20:10:27] <enderx86> It's really just a project to help me learn web programming + algorithms
[20:10:39] <enderx86> So I'm interested in the proper way to do it from the web programming perspective
[20:10:58] <shoky> but that would depend on what the service being offered is
[20:11:15] <shoky> for example, if you want to show the sort interactively to the user.. you'd probably do it in javascript
[20:11:21] <enderx86> Goal: Have the user input the size of a randomly generated list, have the server generate the random list, and output the sort times for different algorithms (insertion sort, mergesort, etc.)
[20:11:40] <shoky> but if all you want to show is the time it took.. then what do you wanna show? the time it takes your server to do it? or the browser?
[20:11:50] <enderx86> the time it takes the server to do it
[20:11:56] <enderx86> good point...
[20:12:11] <enderx86> the browser would be busy handling other requests, so the time it takes from the browser's perspective would be inaccurate, right?
[20:12:20] <enderx86> meaning: it has to be done in PHP
[20:12:35] <shoky> umm they'd both be accurate in that they measure the correct time ;p
[20:12:51] <enderx86> oh
[20:13:04] <shoky> but you have more control over the "experiment" if it's done server-side, yes
[20:13:35] <shoky> anyway doing it serverside will give you experience with ajax

[20:13:51] <enderx86> okay, thanks shoky
[20:14:04] <enderx86> is basically all communication between javascript and PHP done with $.ajax?
[20:14:38] <shoky> javascript can ask the browser to refresh the page
[20:14:41] <shoky> no ajax there
[20:14:49] <enderx86> right
[20:14:55] <shoky> javascript can open a web-socket connection to the server.. no ajax there
[20:14:58] <shoky> etc
[20:15:10] <enderx86> but with ajax, no refresh
[20:15:14] <shoky> yep
[20:15:17] <enderx86> so what i mean is
[20:15:35] <enderx86> are all ajax requests done through $.ajax?
[20:15:42] <enderx86> or are there other libraries / ways to do ajax
[20:15:54] <enderx86> (aside from jQuery)
[20:15:58] <shoky> $.ajax is the jquery way
[20:16:09] <shoky> other libs have their own..
[20:16:15] <enderx86> i see, cool
[20:16:23] <enderx86> i started learning jquery a week ago =/
[20:17:07] <shoky> cool
[20:18:15] <ejo> Hello.  If I  .remove() an element from the DOM but keep it for later reinsertion, does it lose event handlers that were bound to it and its children?
[20:18:32] <shoky> ejo: yes, use .detach() to keep them
[20:18:41] <ejo> ahhh that's what I was thinking of.  Thanks shoky!
[20:18:49] <ejo> internal thesaurus needs coffee
[20:18:55] <shoky> hh
[20:20:06] <gabrieluk> shoky, do you have any cool links so  can get inspired for a next project?
[20:22:25] <ejo> hallelujah
[20:23:38] <black_warlock> guys i have found this script to hold the clickoutside
[20:23:44] <black_warlock> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-outside-events/examples/clickoutside/
[20:24:08] <black_warlock> who can help me apply that to this button
[20:24:17] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/wzKww/12/
[20:24:30] <black_warlock> i mean onclick outside close the menu
[20:26:22] <gabrieluk> oh nvm shoky, i found a good resource now
[20:28:27] <enderx86> Can you do a $.ajax request to a Python script as opposed to a PHP page?
[20:29:31] <shoky> enderx86: yeah.. the browser and jquery don't care what's handling the request or outputting the response
[20:29:47] <enderx86> oh, so what would it look like
[20:30:04] <shoky> on the client it'd look exactly the same
[20:30:19] <shoky> well, the url would probably change
[20:31:35] <shoky> just like you can do a regular request to a python page (just by pasting the url in the address bar), you can also do an ajax request to it
[20:32:48] <enderx86> would the url be "page.py"?
[20:32:55] <enderx86> i've never done python web dev before
[20:32:59] <shoky> if you named it so..
[20:33:20] <razzi> i hate python and ruby
[20:33:25] <enderx86> why do you hate python?
[20:33:28] <enderx86> i hate php
[20:33:33] <razzi> because i'm too old and don't want to learn another new language
[20:33:38] <enderx86> i'm trying to find an excuse to learn a python web framework, instead of write in php
[20:33:47] <jstroem> <3 language flaming
[20:34:10] <enderx86> can anyone give me a reason not to learn python/web.py and stick with php?
[20:34:19] <shoky> no
[20:34:25] <enderx86> shoky: what's your preference?
[20:34:32] <razzi> yes, php is nice
[20:34:34] <enderx86> do you write in PHP or do you use django/RoR/etc.
[20:34:43] <jstroem> enderx86: if you know your way around PHP maybe thats enough?
[20:34:54] <enderx86> I don't... I'm a 10-year java developer, and I'm getting ready to leave Java
[20:34:57] <shoky> most of my backend experience is in java actually
[20:35:00] <shoky> heh
[20:35:08] <black_warlock> why ?
[20:35:13] <black_warlock> dont leave java
[20:35:24] <black_warlock> crazy '
[20:35:27] <enderx86> i prefer python
[20:35:30] <black_warlock> use jsp !
[20:35:37] <enderx86> I'm moving towards web dev.... and I hate JSP/Java
[20:35:40] <enderx86> SO tedious
[20:35:41] <shoky> node is fine for a lot of stuff
[20:35:53] <razzi> web dev is done with php. period.
[20:36:07] <shoky> if i were to build smth new right now, i'd do it in clojure though
[20:36:20] <enderx86> do people here agree with razzi?
[20:36:20] <black_warlock> jsp its the most secure language if used well
[20:36:29] <enderx86> i mean, development is supposed to be FUN, and python is most fun
[20:36:33] <shoky> enderx86: there are ~750 people here
[20:36:36] <enderx86> PHP is death.
[20:36:40] <black_warlock> i see every bank website has been made on jsp :P
[20:36:43] <shoky> php is fun for some
[20:36:59] <shoky> jsp is old..
[20:37:06] <black_warlock> ans still java its very used on app
[20:37:13] <Alpha64> since i started with perl i can't use php anymore
[20:37:47] <Alpha64> but php is very easy for newcomers
[20:37:53] <enderx86> I hate the $ signs
[20:37:54] <black_warlock> if you wanna change radically go for razor
[20:38:07] <black_warlock> and asp.net
[20:38:07] <enderx86> i hate the way loops look, classes look, etc.
[20:38:57] <Alpha64> i love the $ because it does wonders  in perl
[20:39:09] <black_warlock> razor has been empowered
[20:39:22] <shoky> right, let's talk about which symbol's we like..
[20:39:37] <Alpha64> also $ is great because i like money
[20:39:42] <black_warlock> razor stands in html code without opening tags
[20:39:52] <black_warlock> just uses a @
[20:40:48] <razzi> lol @ PHP being dead...
[20:41:50] <enderx86> lol @ Alpha64
[20:41:59] <enderx86> that's why so many people like PHP
[20:42:00] <razzi> each day millions of peeps earn their paycheck with PHP and you say PHP is dead.
[20:42:07] <razzi> yeah all right , sure.
[20:42:11] <enderx86> they think they'll make money off of it with all the dollar signs they have to write...
[20:42:24] <black_warlock> check this out
[20:42:27] <black_warlock> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIv6yR9Q1IA
[20:42:42] <black_warlock> its the 1st of 6 videos
[20:43:54] <black_warlock> this is the future
[20:44:03] <Alpha64> what i don't like about php is that it's very domain specific, and all over the place, but i can understand people liking it for this reasons
[20:44:53] <wassa> howdy... trying to run the following on a googlePlus one api container $('div[id*="plusone"]').removeAttr('style');  it works in firebug but not on the page. is this due to the dom still being created as it is an api / sj call?
[20:45:08] <razzi> what does domain specific mean?
[20:46:41] <Alpha64> it's made for generating web pages
[20:47:34] <Alpha64> as templates most of the time
[20:50:02] <black_warlock> gnight
[20:50:06] <razzi> well, that's a feature
[20:51:40] <wassa> anyone know how you might be able to drop / alter the style of a googleplus one div container? http://jsfiddle.net/fUFTp/
[20:51:41] <Alpha64> yes and no, reusing php for something else is very hard
[20:52:13] <Alpha64> but if you only want to do webpages as templates, it's fine
[20:52:33] <tw2113> put your code at the bottom of the page, so that it has better chance of running after the G+ stuff has loaded
[20:52:44] <wassa> i tried that
[20:52:49] <tw2113> wrapping it in $(document).ready() may help too
[20:52:58] <wassa> tried that too
[20:53:05] <tw2113> not sure if g+ is in an iframe or not
[20:54:39] <wassa> if you just inspect the element you will see its outer container is ___plusone_0 that is wrapping an iframe. I just want to kill that outer container style and apply new class.
[21:00:30] <zeroquake> i have a strange problem http://zero9916.net46.net/examples/basic.html     when the page slides to right , scrollbar appears , but when it slides to left . scrollbar doesn't appear
[21:00:35] <wassa> tw2113 I have updated the sample. http://jsfiddle.net/fUFTp/2/  for some reason the container holding the google api won't update.
[21:05:30] <smoothlists> Question: I am using a jQuery tooltips plugin on my page.  Plugin code: http://pastebin.com/vLjVbSb5
[21:05:40] <smoothlists> And this is my HTML: http://pastebin.com/Py8AYGw9
[21:05:53] <smoothlists> Please see the HTML link, as I have commented in the problem there
[21:06:03] <smoothlists> Basically, I can't get the tooltips to work on my JavaScript-generated links, although they work on hard-coded links
[21:07:08] <smoothlists> Is there a way to "attach" the tooltip code to the "carousel" id?
[21:10:47] <tw2113> no idea wassa
[21:10:56] <tw2113> what exactly are you trying to change?
[21:12:01] <wassa> were you able to see the update showing the second plusone container?
[21:12:50] <tw2113> i saw "the second plus one container " yes
[21:13:20] <wassa> i know my jquery command is good. after page load in the firebug console if i run it then the style disappears. but for some reason, it seems the jquery is running before the dom is loaded.
[21:13:50] <wassa> tried putting the script in the head, body top and body bottom
[21:14:53] <wassa> and the command fires successfully on the second plusone container no problem as well.
[21:27:06] <smoothlists> see you later
[21:34:20] <erdos> hey if i set a bunch of event listeners on an element, is there any way to force the order in which they are called?
[21:34:57] <erdos> (same event, a bunch of times)
[21:35:30] <dblosevn> ya bind order
[21:35:40] <dblosevn> last its a LIG+FO stack
[21:35:44] <dblosevn> *LIFO
[21:35:57] <dblosevn> @erdos
[21:35:58] <erdos> in order that it's declared in the script?
[21:36:03] <dblosevn> no reverse
[21:36:10] <erdos> cool thank you :)
[21:36:10] <dblosevn> last in first out LIFO
[21:36:22] <dblosevn> np
[21:36:27] <erdos> got ya, i wasn't sure if it was some pool that i couldn't depend on the order of
[21:36:37] <erdos> dblosevn++
[21:36:41] <dblosevn> sorry was plaiyin call of duty and failed typin lol
[21:37:03] <erdos> heheh the help is much appreciated!
[21:37:08] <erdos> multi tasking!
[21:37:13] <dblosevn> lol
