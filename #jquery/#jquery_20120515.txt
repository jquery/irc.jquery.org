[00:01:46] <wkmanire> hope: Sure. Just render an unordered list in your response from your database data then all $.sortable() on it.
[00:01:54] <wkmanire> call*
[00:02:23] <wkmanire> Don't forget to add references to jQuery-ui and it's CSS file.

[00:17:58] <Back2Basics> How do I send this form (6 textfields) via json? http://bpaste.net/show/jYZz5wEYV86dKrLoQ4Wo/
[00:18:35] <Back2Basics> I'm missing something in the .ajax call.
[00:18:57] <wkmanire> hope: Try to solve the problem first, then if you have problems come back and ask us questions.
[00:19:26] <hope> wkmanire: thanks
[00:20:36] <systemfault> Back2Basics: I guess you'll need to JSON.stringify your object you're passing to "data" and also, you probably want to set the "contentType" config option accordingly.
[00:21:21] <hope> wkmanire: sorry for the PM i just want to say my problem
[00:25:17] <wkmanire> hope: No need to apologize.
[00:25:29] <wkmanire> hope: A good idea when signing into IRC channels is to check the channel topic.
[00:25:41] <wkmanire> Very often channel policies are listed there.
[00:25:42] <thirdknife> is there any plugin that can generate this kind a text box ? http://imgur.com/5cmPC
[00:26:34] <wkmanire> thirdknife: You wan't a spinner?
[00:26:44] <wkmanire> AKA numeric up/down
[00:27:27] <Back2Basics> systemfault: so not data.serialize()
[00:27:43] <wkmanire> Damn, I thought they were adding one to jquery-ui.
[00:27:47] <systemfault> Back2Basics: You said you want to send it as jsonâ€¦
[00:28:00] <Back2Basics> systemfault: Yes yes yes.
[00:28:11] <stenno|work> serializing json must be the most easy thing ever
[00:28:13] <systemfault> Back2Basics: .serialize is to create a application/x-www-form-urlencoded string
[00:28:35] <stenno|work> it _is_ already serialized, come to think of it
[00:29:16] <Back2Basics> systemfault.:  yeah I don't want to do that.  (sorry this is my first use case for json)
[00:30:47] <thirdknife> wka
[00:31:27] <thirdknife> wkmanire, its like a counter user can increase and decrease i can write my self i was looking if thats already out so that i can use it.
[00:31:57] <wkmanire> thirdknife: Yeah, like I said, I thought there was going to be one in jQuery-UI but it doesn't seem like it is there yet.
[00:32:08] <wkmanire> I hope they get around to adding one because it is a really useful widget to have
[00:32:38] <thirdknife> yeah right on
[00:32:39] <wkmanire> Especially when the keyboard is integrated.
[00:33:18] <wkmanire> You might still be able to find one ready made.
[00:33:36] <wkmanire> Just add spinner and numeric up/down to your search terms.
[00:43:02] <vl1234> how to use rich text popup using jquery and store into html text;
[00:43:30] <Cork> vl1234: contentEditable
[00:44:45] <vl1234> @cork...........first how to invoke that rich textarea when focus the textbox
[00:45:03] <Cork> vl1234: its not on a textbox
[00:45:08] <Cork> its on a html element
[00:45:19] <Cork> ex. <div contentEditable="true"></div>
[00:46:06] <vl1234> @cork...........oh we want to create spt div tag........k ill try
[00:46:30] <Cork> ?mdc contentEditable
[00:46:31] <caniuse> Cork: Content Editable - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Content_Editable
[00:46:45] <Cork> vl1234: ^
[00:48:08] <Back2Basics> systemfault: do I need a converter? http://bpaste.net/show/q6hijLjhdDEPQtC4y9k5/
[00:48:46] <systemfault> Back2Basics: You'll probably need to JSON.stringify the object
[00:49:03] <Back2Basics> systemfault: I did data1 = data.stringify(),
[00:49:21] <systemfault> What is that supposed to do?
[00:49:27] <Cork> JSON.stringify(data1)
[00:49:42] <Cork> *JSON.stringify(data)
[00:50:14] <Back2Basics> it's supposed to take the object and stringify it.  (well if we were in python it might work.)
[00:50:37] <stenno|work> l2javascript, Back2Basics
[00:51:11] <stenno|work> also this can easily be done in javascript, too :);
[00:51:34] <stenno|work> there you have an even higher grade of modularity
[00:53:09] <systemfault> Hmm.. I'm not able to use the jsfiddle echo API...
[00:53:53] <Cork> systemfault: what about it?
[00:55:13] <systemfault> Cork: I cannot send a json body to the echo api of jsfiddleâ€¦  http://jsfiddle.net/BkpKM/1/
[00:55:48] <systemfault> Anyway.. it's just a jsfiddle issueâ€¦ it's not important.
[00:57:06] <Cork> systemfault: data JSON.stringify isn't valid
[00:57:35] <Cork> and no it shouldn't work
[00:58:38] <Back2Basics> in javascript what is a functionname that does Nothing?
[00:58:40] <systemfault> Cork: Then how do I do it?
[00:59:02] <systemfault> Back2Basics: What?
[00:59:06] <stenno|work> Back2Basics, you normally don't need that
[00:59:09] <stenno|work> there is no pass()
[00:59:18] <stenno|work> there is continue or return
[00:59:21] <Back2Basics> systemfault: I need a placeholder for the .post() function
[00:59:30] <stenno|work> function() {}
[00:59:39] <stenno|work> ^ anonymous function that does nothing
[01:00:10] <Cork> systemfault: they way you did it first http://jsfiddle.net/BkpKM/2/
[01:00:41] <systemfault> Cork: But that doesn't send a JSON body :/
[01:00:57] <Cork> does for me
[01:01:14] <systemfault> Cork: Look at the request payload..
[01:01:19] <systemfault> Cork: It's form data...
[01:01:22] <systemfault> json=%7B%22hello%22%3A%22hi%22%7D
[01:02:04] <Cork> ya?
[01:02:09] <Cork> that IS the body
[01:02:22] <Cork> its url-form-encoded
[01:02:38] <Cork> and its what /echo expects
[01:02:58] <Cork> what you get back is from the response
[01:03:15] <Cork> "{"hello": "hi"}"
[01:04:01] <systemfault> Ahâ€¦ It's really echo's fault then.
[01:04:08] <Cork> ?eval decodeURIComponent('%7B%22hello%22%3A%22hi%22%7D')
[01:04:08] <caniuse> Cork: '{"hello":"hi"}'
[01:04:16] <Cork> systemfault: no its not
[01:04:19] <Back2Basics> how about this for a return value?  UnicodeMultiDict([('tags', u'a'), ('title', u'a'), ('desc', u'desc'), ('coteach', u''), ('teachaid', u''), ('languagecode', u'en-us'), ('page1', u''), ('page1', u'')]) Status: 200 content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 0 Cache-Control: no-cache
[01:04:24] <Cork> i'm not sure what you see as a problem here
[01:04:42] <stenno|work> Back2Basics, what syntax is that?
[01:05:12] <Back2Basics> it's print repr(self.request.POST) from python
[01:05:30] <stenno|work> oh python
[01:05:34] <Back2Basics> the output of anyway
[01:05:35] <stenno|work> what does u'foo' mean?
[01:05:43] <Back2Basics> unicode of foo
[01:06:01] <systemfault> Cork: If I set contentType: "application/json" then the body of the request should be only application/json and not form dataâ€¦ It's basic HTTP stuff.
[01:06:15] <Back2Basics> but if it says content-type: text/html that's not json is it.
[01:06:16] * stenno|work as a ruby programmer is a bit envious about unicode support in python
[01:06:41] <Back2Basics> yup
[01:10:37] <Back2Basics> new version http://bpaste.net/show/9vbeYUKMUYMX6jG8napz/   trouble spot at line 78-79 I think.
[01:12:21] * tga grubles at the jquerymobile docs using version 1.0b and not matching the current library
[01:12:30] <tga> they even include examples that won't work with the current version
[01:14:36] <Back2Basics> is there something on line 70-77 that I should be looking out for?
[01:18:08] <Back2Basics> can I write the application/json header?
[01:21:43] <coldhead> HE SAID HE ALWAYS KNEW HER / ALONG THE SHORRRRRRELINNNNNE
[01:22:02] <stenno|work> and, did he?
[01:40:10] <raven_king> hi..can someone look at my site: http://greenpantry.in/test820fcec and tell me why there is a slight jerk when using smooth scroll. This is the script I am using: http://pastebin.com/fRPZ9zYb
[01:43:42] <terryleigh> I'm using a datepicker plugin.. and a plugin to make my labels disappear when text is inputed.. but the label doesn't always disappear when a date is selected with the date picker.. any ideas?
[02:12:18] <haribo> I am using jquiry ui multiselect (http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/) and they work fine. But now I am making an button that appends rows to a table with a multiselect inside. The select is not visible but the multiselect is not visible either.
[02:12:59] <haribo> My guess is that maybe cause the script is already loaded and the select is added lated to the DOM ? Does anobody know how to refresh this or work around it?
[02:13:45] <stenno|work> haribo, check .live
[02:14:30] <haribo> stenno|work: hah you are in here too! Making me move to #jqeury haha! But what do you mean with check .live ?
[02:14:35] <rosieres_respawn> has somebody an idea how to get the position of an area ? i´ve got a imagemap with areas running an each() on it and trying to get the position by offset() on $(this) - i do also clear the variable for the offset eeverytime - but position I get is always the same . . .
[02:15:47] <subdesign> hey, do you know a plugin that rotates text like a slideshow, and not images?
[02:17:04] <stenno|work> haribo, http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:22:51] <DrBombae> subdesign: as I understand your question, you just want to replace a particular text node in a document?
[02:23:12] <DrBombae> so that the new text will flow around images like the old text did
[02:23:30] <subdesign> DrBombae, i guess i want some news ticker .. i didn't know the exact name of it
[02:23:36] <subdesign> now i found some
[02:24:56] <haribo> stenno|work I recreated the function like in the examples there. The row is added so it is working but again the multiselect is not showing.
[02:25:57] <haribo> stenno|work: The html is actually just a selectbox with the attribute multiselect=multiselect. The selectbox is not showing so it seems multiselect does hide it. But just nothing is placed over it
[02:26:16] <stenno|work> what does your css say?
[02:26:22] <stenno|work> inspect it with firebug
[02:26:27] <stenno|work> maybe you have some strange rules
[02:27:50] <haribo> stenno|work: if I just place the <tr>..</tr> in the document without adding it using an event to the DOM then it shows perfectly so my CSS should be fine. It only does not show when I append it to the table.
[02:28:22] <dman777> anyone know of a jquery plugin that will show a grid of thumbnails of photos with all of them doing the ken burns effect at the same time?
[02:28:35] <haribo> stenno|work: in other words it only doesnt show when I dynamicly add it after the page has already been loaded
[02:30:01] <DrBombae> dman: you can show a table where each cell has a background and you can animate the background position. You don't need a plugin for that
[02:30:54] <dman777> DrBombae: i was thinking about that. and just apply the ken burn effect in javascript to it?
[02:31:36] <DrBombae> If you want to pan across the image, changing the background position will do that
[02:32:06] <haribo> stenno|work: the widget contains a refresh function that I tried but that only seems for when you dynamicly add options to the selectbox. It does not make the hole selectbox appear.
[02:32:56] <stenno|work> haribo, now its time to paste your code :)
[02:33:10] <stenno|work> (the relevant part)
[02:33:51] <DrBombae> if you want to change the image scale, unfortunately backgrounds do not support that
[02:37:49] <Nece228> hello
[02:38:02] <Nece228> i have a form, i need to send data to server without refreshing
[02:38:57] <stenno|work> Nece228, xhr
[02:39:19] <Nece228> basically i have send button which opens the url
[02:39:34] <dman777> DrBombae: i found a some javascript code where this guy wrote the ken burns effect using canvas. http://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/2011/2/26/ken-burns-effect-with-javascript-and-canvas/ can i just grid the photo thumbnails and have each one call the ken burns function?
[02:41:53] <haribo> stenno|work: here is the code: http://pastebin.com/qQf2tEVg  (and offcourse there are references to the jquery.js multiselect.js en multiselect.css from the multiselect widget)
[02:42:11] <Nece228> ah nevermind found tutorial
[02:42:43] <DrBombae> you know, "zooming" and "panning" were things before Ken Burns showed up
[02:43:25] <johnline3> http://images.summitpost.org/original/471736.jpg
[02:44:10] <DrBombae> anyway, I don't know what can be done with someone else's plugin, but I think it's possible to zoom and pan images without using canvas
[02:44:29] <haribo> stenno|work: sorry forgot to give the table the id used by the append (it is there in the code but the table is too huge. And made a new click listener as I used to use just javascript functios as you can see in the link. I created the click listener for .live / .on
[02:45:21] <KOTRET> http://jsfiddle.net/DH8WG/ any hints? seems each does not allow a object field named "length"
[02:46:42] <haribo> stenno|work: quickly updated it here: http://pastebin.com/7xNc7bFR
[02:48:18] <stenno|work> haribo, but you didn't bind to the a
[02:48:33] <quicksilver> KOTRET: if it sees 'length' it assumes it is an Array-like object and iterates through numeric indices.
[02:48:36] <stenno|work> .live is not neccessary here
[02:48:59] <stenno|work> haribo, you bound onlick to the td? is that intended..?
[02:49:03] <quicksilver> this is because javascript sucks and doesn't give a particularly clean or sensible way to distinguish between objects, plain data, and arrays.
[02:49:21] <KOTRET> quicksilver: any suggestion where to find it in the code @ http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js ?
[02:49:30] <quicksilver> I don't know why .each checks for length instead of checking the prototype
[02:49:39] <quicksilver> but I guess they had a reason.
[02:50:15] <quicksilver> KOTRET: sure, search for "each:", it's the second occurrence.
[02:50:28] <quicksilver> length = object.length, isObj = length === undefined || jQuery.isFunction( object );
[02:50:50] <KOTRET> narf :D
[02:51:01] <quicksilver> so if length is defined, isObj will be false. and it goes into the second for loop
[02:51:25] <KOTRET> okay... i would consider this as bug :>
[02:51:45] <haribo> stenno|work: it was a quick work around as my framework generates my <a> and quickly wanted to test the .live .to. I used the onclick="" to call a javascript function altho this is probable not really the jquery way.
[02:52:00] <quicksilver> KOTRET: well, it's a language stupidity really. Do some googling for javascript for loops and hasOwnProperty
[02:52:11] <quicksilver> KOTRET: you will see lots of nasty ways of doing it and nothing really nice.
[02:52:50] <KOTRET> quicksilver: too bad :( thank you for the hint!
[02:53:01] <haribo> stenno|work: the javascript function has the same functions inside and both work they both append the string to the table body. Except in both ways the selectbox code is there but the jquery multiselect is not shown (drawed or what)
[02:53:38] <quicksilver> KOTRET: also some discussion in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/684672/loop-through-javascript-object
[02:53:42] <stenno|work> so it is not there when you inspect the code, or it isn't there because of css or so?
[02:55:24] <haribo> stenno|work: I see that the css of the multiselect hides the origional select as it draws its own select on that place. I am not suppose to see the html select box. I am suppose to see a custom multiselect box
[02:57:31] <haribo> stenno|work: after allot of searching I found a function to make it redraw!
[02:57:51] <haribo> as expected I had to make it redraw after appending
[03:04:18] <quetzyg> good morning
[03:05:05] <D4> How'd I set the scroll speed of a page or how I'd be able to smooth the scrolling of a page?
[03:05:40] <stenno|work> thats browser-specific i'd say
[03:05:50] <stenno|work> i am nearly 100% sure you cannot set that with javascript
[03:07:22] <sanova> hi
[03:08:22] <sanova> how can i append variable text for a label into dialog form ?
[03:09:36] <sanova> i have just tried something like this: $("#r-dialog_form").append("span#r-id_span").html(position).dialog({...}); but result is empty dialog
[03:09:39] <D4> stenno|work » Well, I meant like preventing the standard scrolling and implementing another which is smoother and works like.. well all them "go to DIV", "smooth scroll to element" etc types out there
[03:14:36] <rosieres_respawn> is something written wrong here ? .css({'cursor':'pointer','position':'absolute','left':+event.clientX+'px','top':+event.clientY+'px'});
[03:14:54] <KOTRET> quicksiver: not that simple to fix this, gonna use another fieldname... :<
[03:25:35] <dman777> anyone know of any 3d accordian plug ins?
[03:50:06] <Aamir> http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored wow
[04:00:23] <andr0id> hey guys, can anyone tell me how to reload the page after closing the colorbox?
[04:03:42] <andr0id> anyone?
[04:04:09] <stenno|work> ... closing the colorbox?
[04:04:14] <stenno|work> what is a colorbox?
[04:04:37] <andr0id> http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox
[04:04:44] <stenno|work> dunno that, sorry
[04:04:49] <DrBombae> https://www.google.com/webhp?q=javascript%20force%20reload
[04:05:38] <andr0id> DrBombae, should i add the window.location.reload after the close function of the colorbox?
[04:14:23] <Jagan> hi;;;
[04:14:27] <Flo0815> hi
[04:14:37] <stenno|work> hi|||
[04:14:47] <Flo0815> :)
[04:15:21] <Jagan> I want to add image next to textbox when focus of that textfield...can anyone help me?
[04:15:56] <Flo0815> $('#textfield').focus(function(){ $(this).append('<img src="">');})
[04:16:26] <stenno|work> and you can bind on .blur to remove it afterwards
[04:18:33] <andr0id> DrBombae, it worked :D
[04:20:19] <PhonicUK> this is interesting
[04:20:39] <DrBombae> hmph
[04:20:44] <PhonicUK> chrome-devtools://devtools/DevTools.js
[04:21:13] <PhonicUK> I wonder if I can rip that apart enough to make code set breakpoints on itself?
[04:21:32] <vpv4oo> having javascript $('#foo').bind({ click: }); i want to .load() a bar.php containing #foo AFTER the script has loaded. is there a way of preloading bar.php so that the javascript bind()s are finding their not-yet-loaded elements?
[04:21:54] <stenno|work> PhonicUK, well js is js
[04:22:10] <PhonicUK> stenno|work, indeed - except this is over 60K lines of js
[04:22:23] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing click on Price Matrix tab, now when you select drop-downs it should highlight the column, then the row, but it only highlights the row. why?
[04:22:25] <stenno|work> what wtf
[04:22:28] <stenno|work> that is a lot of js
[04:22:39] <DrBombae> vpv: it's either loaded or it isn't
[04:22:41] <PhonicUK> it is an absolute behemouth
[04:22:51] <DrBombae> there's no event on "loaded but not really"
[04:22:52] <stenno|work> well, have fun then :) hope that its reasonably commented
[04:22:59] <PhonicUK> its not commented at all
[04:23:05] <stenno|work> haha
[04:23:15] <PhonicUK> the variable and function names are at least reasonable though
[04:23:22] <stenno|work> good
[04:23:28] <stenno|work> images you'd have to work on minified :D
[04:23:34] <stenno|work> imagine*
[04:23:39] <PhonicUK> i wouldn't bother xD
[04:23:49] <PhonicUK> and Alpine makes it really easy to test things like this :D
[04:24:02] <stenno|work> didn't hear of it
[04:24:19] <PhonicUK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5lGwqi8L_g
[04:28:26] <PhonicUK> stenno|work, seen it?
[04:29:04] <andr0id> i have a text box, that i enter a number, now, when i enter it, onchange, how to make it call a script that does some calculations and writes in the db using php/mysql? i have the php script, i just dont know how to call it. and when it changes, after calculation, to update the result from the script calculation to be visible in the table i am showing. any help with that?
[04:29:19] <stenno|work> PhonicUK, i am at work right now, cannot watch yt
[04:29:31] <PhonicUK> ah
[04:38:04] <Flo0815> hey guys, i have a problem with $.ajax. I have a index.html, which does a ajax request loading a XML-file. When i try to open it in Chrom with doubleclicking on the index.html file, the ajax request throws an error: Access-Control-Allow-Origin. I think it's a cross-domain-problem. Can someone help me?
[04:38:34] <PhonicUK> Flo0815, where is the XML file located?
[04:38:48] <Flo0815> in a subfolder of the dir, where the index.html is
[04:38:56] <Flo0815> so it's not really a cross-domain-request
[04:39:07] <PhonicUK> is this on a local filesystem instead of a web server?
[04:39:11] <siks> is there anything that even remotely resembles "best practice" for handling changes with html5 input types? namely "number"
[04:39:36] <Flo0815> PhonicUK: when i doubleClick is it like a local filesystem
[04:39:47] <Flo0815> so in addressbar is C://...
[04:39:50] <siks> actually, hm, it's a polyfill so i probably need to hack that
[04:39:53] <PhonicUK> okay, thats probably why
[04:39:55] <Flo0815> no, file://
[04:40:10] <PhonicUK> try putting it on an actual webserver
[04:40:13] <PhonicUK> and see if you still have the problem
[04:40:17] <Flo0815> no i don't
[04:40:23] <Flo0815> but i need to do it this way
[04:40:29] <PhonicUK> why?
[04:40:30] <Flo0815> for an ipad-container-app
[04:40:32] <PhonicUK> (you may not be able to)
[04:40:35] <Flo0815> or iBook sth.
[04:40:36] <PhonicUK> ah
[04:41:01] <PhonicUK> can you do it by making a xmlhttprequest yourself outside of jquery?
[04:41:35] <Flo0815> sure
[04:41:50] <Flo0815> but i don't know how the syntax is :D
[04:41:56] <PhonicUK> thats what google is for
[04:42:00] <Flo0815> jup
[04:42:05] <Flo0815> so i should try this?
[04:43:22] <Jagan> .
[04:44:17] <MindSpark> hi, if I use the load function twice on the same url, is the content cached?
[04:44:50] <PhonicUK> depends
[04:58:13] <Flo0815> PhonicUK: doesn't change anything
[04:59:02] <youngin> Guys that have things that can't be taught
[04:59:41] <Flo0815> ?
[05:00:35] <MindSpark> PhonicUK, on?
[05:00:47] <PhonicUK> I am
[05:01:02] <MindSpark> on you are?
[05:01:07] <PhonicUK> ?
[05:01:16] <MindSpark> you said it depends...?
[05:01:16] <PhonicUK> aah
[05:01:20] <PhonicUK> it depends on a lot of things
[05:01:28] <PhonicUK> the type of content, and what cache settings the server specified
[05:01:43] <MindSpark> let's say I want to load a portion of the file into one place and another portion into another
[05:02:08] <MindSpark> so let's say I do a file.html #content and then a file.html #morecontent
[05:02:24] <Cork> MindSpark: you don't want to do that
[05:02:34] <Cork> that loads the complete file twice
[05:02:35] <MindSpark> Cork, why not?
[05:02:50] <Cork> if your lucky its just cache hit
[05:02:53] <MindSpark> that was the question, so it's not cached...
[05:03:06] <Cork> its up to the browser
[05:03:25] <MindSpark> so jquery doesn't cache the content into a variable or something...?
[05:03:29] <Cork> but the .load with id is a hack, its a sub optimal solution
[05:03:39] <MindSpark> Cork, what do you recommend
[05:03:40] <Cork> not when your using load no
[05:03:49] <Cork> MindSpark: send fragments from the server
[05:04:06] <Cork> so you just send the data need and not all the overhead
[05:04:24] <MindSpark> not an option. I don't have access to the server
[05:04:47] <MindSpark> or let's say I use a cms that doesn't allow that to happen easily
[05:05:27] <Cork> ok, then the best option is to use .get and do what .load does, but from the same object
[05:06:19] <MindSpark> can I use the DOM if I load the return into a variable?
[05:06:24] <MindSpark> or do I have to place it in a div?
[05:07:26] <Cork> $.get(url, function(data) { var doc = $('<div/>').append(data); $(parent1).append(doc.find('#content1')); $(parent2).append(doc.find('#content2')); });
[05:07:55] <Cork> thats basically what .load does anyway
[05:08:20] <Famic> is seems I can't get the .css('background-image') in chrome even though it works fine in ff. Any idea why ?
[05:09:11] <Cork> Famic: is it an url, uri-data or gradient?
[05:09:24] <Famic> Cork: url
[05:09:38] <Cork> should work, you have a link?
[05:10:18] <Famic> http://demo.lindicible.com/lusine2/
[05:10:27] <Famic> I'm talking about the section element
[05:10:35] <MindSpark> Cork, alright, thanks!
[05:11:03] <Cork> Famic: you mean var bkgImage = $(this).css('background-image'); ?
[05:11:10] <Famic> yes
[05:11:38] <Famic> seems it works from the console
[05:12:22] <Deele> could someone help me with http://jhtmlarea.codeplex.com/ ? I want to understand, how to get that jHtmlArea object, so I could interact with jHtmlArea functions, like html or updateHtmlArea
[05:13:13] <Cork> Famic: interesting
[05:15:41] <Cork> Famic: wfm on reload at least
[05:15:51] <Famic> wfm ?
[05:16:40] <Cork> Famic: works for me
[05:16:56] <Cork> tested in chromium 18
[05:17:28] <Cork> though first time i tried i got "none" in chromium
[05:17:31] <Cork> can't reproduce it now
[05:17:43] <Cork> i'm guessing its a race condition or something
[05:18:12] <Famic> I'm testing locally, I can't get it to show a value
[05:19:21] <Keir_> hi can anyone please explain the css scope on a ui theme for me?
[05:21:10] <Cork> Keir_: scop?
[05:21:23] <Cork> what scope are you talking about?
[05:22:24] <Keir_> I'm just looking at the advanced theme download settings, and you can apply a css scope, in theory enabling you to use more than one theme on a page
[05:23:24] <Cork> thats new to me, where do you find this option?
[05:24:23] <Keir_> on the download page on the right hand side in the theme section there is a small dropdown titled "Advanced Theme Settings"
[05:25:06] <Cork> ah the custom downloader
[05:25:38] <Cork> Keir_: check the ?
[05:25:55] <Cork> its a selector that it prepends to the css file
[05:26:13] <Cork> so the css only works on things inside ex #app or something
[05:26:27] <Keir_> i'm just wondering how to utilise the css scope, do I just need to specify a parent class or id as the scope?
[05:26:45] <Cork> or even a dom element
[05:26:49] <Cork> like section
[05:26:58] <Cork> or nav or so on
[05:27:31] <Keir_> so i need to put the css attribute aswell as the name, such as the .parent for class or #parent for id?
[05:27:49] <Keir_> not attribute, selector :P
[05:28:12] <Cork> yes
[05:28:16] <Cork> its a normal css selector
[05:28:16] <Keir_> thank you :)
[05:28:37] <Keir_> do you know if datepicker will fall under that hierarchy
[05:28:59] <Cork> everything can fall underit
[05:29:08] <Cork> just set the container option
[05:29:20] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing click on Price Matrix tab, now when you select drop-downs it should highlight the column, then the row, but it only highlights the row. why?
[05:32:03] <Keir_> whats the container option?
[05:34:26] <Cork> Keir_: things that can be dragged like, draggable, sortable, dialog ... has an option container
[05:34:43] <Cork> *containment
[05:34:47] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[05:35:59] <Keir_> datepicker doesn't seem to have that option does it?
[05:36:23] <Cork> nope, and i think it floats relative to the input element
[05:36:27] <fRAiLtY-> Cork ^^
[05:36:30] <Cork> so it doesn't need it
[05:36:50] <Keir_> seems to be appended to the end of the document though, thats my problem
[05:39:07] <Cork> Keir_: donno then
[05:39:13] <Keir_> nw, thanks anyway
[05:39:15] <Cork> never used datepicker much
[05:40:57] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it doesn't select anything for me
[05:41:07] <Cork> nether row or column
[05:41:20] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  hmm, mine selects a row and that's it.. what's the issue do you think
[05:41:41] <Cork> might be number offsets or something
[05:41:42] <fRAiLtY-> Its drop-downs 1&2 that effect it
[05:41:51] <Cork> put some debugging code in and check
[05:43:20] <Famic> I don't get it... firefox finds the background-image everytimes, chrome doesn't most of the times, and the behaviour is really weird
[05:43:39] <Famic> I added a console.log, it worked the first time, then never again
[05:44:13] <Famic> I changed it to .css('background') instead of .css('background-image'), same thing : fine the first time, then always none
[05:44:22] <johnkpaul> ?demo @Famic
[05:44:37] <johnkpaul> still not bot?
[05:44:38] <Famic> johnkpaul: just read above
[05:44:46] <Famic> I pasted a link already
[05:45:19] <Famic> http://demo.lindicible.com/lusine3/
[05:45:25] <Cork> Famic: i could reproduce it the first time i loaded the page in chromium, then never again, so can't help
[05:45:41] <Famic> Cork: that's weird cos it's the opposite here
[05:46:55] <Famic> looks like clearing the cache allows to have it work one time again
[05:47:09] <_ramok> hi
[05:47:11] <johnkpaul> Famic: why not use css classes and keep everything in your css file?
[05:47:23] <_ramok> does anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/6fYPE/3/ i don't get any test in the iframe?
[05:47:25] <johnkpaul> this seems like it's some attempt to be responsive to window size?
[05:47:25] <_ramok> best regards,
[05:47:29] <_ramok> :)
[05:47:35] <Famic> johnkpaul: ?
[05:47:44] <Famic> I need to find out the height of the current background-image
[05:47:57] <johnkpaul> also, Famic, that wierd swinging machine is really creepy :)
[05:48:10] <johnkpaul> Famic: why do you need to find that height? are you tring to switch it out when the window resizes/
[05:48:49] <Famic> johnkpaul: I am moving the background image relatively to the section container when the user scrolls
[05:48:52] <_ramok> any ideas?
[05:49:15] <johnkpaul> _ramok: I get text in the iframe in chrome 19 osx
[05:49:27] <jedimorten> hi. I have an addClass line on docready. $('#wrap p .colw4').addClass('editable'); The idea is to add the class to all p`s with  .colw4 inside #wrap, however it only adds the class to the first p with this criteria. Any idea what to do?
[05:49:37] <johnkpaul> oh Famic, I see
[05:49:46] <Famic> anyhow, the issue is not related to any of that. It's just a problem of getting the css background-image
[05:49:59] <Famic> in webkit browsers
[05:50:18] <johnkpaul> in my console, I see main.js:41 logging url(imgpath)
[05:50:18] <_ramok> johnkpaul: me not on FF 12.0
[05:50:43] <johnkpaul> hmm, on FF 12, I see it, and then it disappears
[05:51:03] <Famic> johnkpaul: I get that the first time, then if I refresh the page I just get 'none'
[05:51:28] <fRAiLtY-> Is it wrong to have 2 of these in a file jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[05:51:32] <johnkpaul> Famic: hm, on about 5 refreshes, I get none once
[05:51:46] <Famic> johnkpaul: what do you mean "it disappears" in ff ?
[05:51:48] <johnkpaul> fRAiLtY-: no, it's not wrong, potentially confusing if you have too many though
[05:51:50] <stygyan> hello there
[05:51:57] <johnkpaul> Famic: that was for _ramok, not you
[05:52:02] <Famic> k
[05:52:05] <stygyan> anyone knows about jquery tools?
[05:52:05] <fRAiLtY-> johnkpaul:  So theoretically one wouldn't upset the other?
[05:52:17] <johnkpaul> fRAiLtY-: no, they are executed in order with which they are added
[05:52:20] <jedimorten> (oops, sorry. none of the p`s got the class i wanted to add)
[05:52:31] <eshlox> hm, <form method="post">, it's possible to add action="something" with jquery/js?
[05:52:48] <johnkpaul> Famic: have you tried logging css("background")
[05:52:53] <stygyan> http://jsfiddle.net/km7bC/
[05:52:54] <johnkpaul> does that every come up with "none"?
[05:52:56] <_ramok> johnkpaul: hm, what could that bee?
[05:52:57] <stygyan> this
[05:52:58] <Cork> eshlox: yes ajax and methid: 'something'
[05:53:03] <Cork> *method
[05:53:04] <stygyan> i dont know how to make the first item active
[05:53:06] <Famic> johnkpaul: yes, I have the same behaviour. ok the first time, then not
[05:53:11] <johnkpaul> _ramok: my first thought is something in jsfiddle, have you tried something on it's own?
[05:53:19] <Famic> but I don't see why you don't have the same result
[05:53:21] <_ramok> no
[05:53:27] <fRAiLtY-> johnkpaul: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing click on Price Matrix tab, now when you select drop-downs it should highlight the column, then the row, but it only highlights the row. why?
[05:53:52] <Cork> eshlox: sorry i always forget they call it type on ajax >_<
[05:53:54] <johnkpaul> Famic: have you tried getting the css directly, without jQuery? is this background image coming from the css class, or inline style?
[05:54:03] <johnkpaul> :) fRAiLtY-, I have no idea
[05:54:26] <Famic> johnkpaul: it comes from the stylesheet
[05:54:49] <Famic> I don't believe I can get it from the DOM element
[05:55:20] <johnkpaul> Famic: what do you mean? this.style.background
[05:55:44] <Famic> isn't that only aviable for inline styles ?
[05:56:14] <defaultro> morning folks, what does this code do? http://pastebin.com/2azWs81q
[05:56:20] <johnkpaul> no, when you set it directly, it becomes an inline style, Famic
[05:56:25] <defaultro> sorry, ignore
[05:56:56] <Famic> johnkpaul: I don't "set it firectly", I set it in a stylesheet
[05:57:50] <johnkpaul> yeah, I know Famic
[05:58:04] <johnkpaul> so I think I have an idea bout your issue
[05:58:18] <johnkpaul> in the stylesheet, do you set it on an id selector or class selector?
[05:58:26] <Famic> id
[06:00:15] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn getcomputedstyle @ Famic
[06:00:16] <caniuse> Famic: window.getComputedStyle - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.getComputedStyle
[06:00:25] <Famic> this to me there is some kind of bug in jquery when retrieving css property in chrome, due to caching mechanism
[06:01:09] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Done a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/6eUQb/4/ Try that, You can see it selects the row and selects the green square over the cross-point, but doesn't select the column, it should do :x
[06:01:10] <johnkpaul> Famic: if you can boil that down to a test case, you should submit a bug
[06:01:43] <johnkpaul> I believe you btw, Famic, getComputedStyle works for me every time
[06:02:45] <jedimorten> ok I`ll rephrase my question :P How do I add a class to all p`s with class ".colw4" which are inside a div with id "#wrapper"?
[06:03:01] <johnkpaul> jedimorten: $("#wrapper").find(".colw4"
[06:03:12] <johnkpaul> jedimorten: $("#wrapper").find(".colw4").addClass("your-new-class")
[06:04:10] <jedimorten> the problem is tha .colw4 is also divs containing images, so I want just p`s with .colw4
[06:04:24] <johnkpaul> jedimorten: $("#wrapper").find("p.colw4").addClass("your-new-class")
[06:04:58] <johnkpaul> but also, jedimorten, that seems really confusing that you have divs, ps, and imgs having the same class called colw4
[06:06:04] <jedimorten> it might.. but its a style to set the width of the elements
[06:06:09] <stygyan> guys
[06:06:11] <stygyan> what's wrong with this?
[06:06:11] <jedimorten> *styleclass
[06:06:12] <stygyan> http://jsfiddle.net/km7bC/1/
[06:06:28] <Famic> johnkpaul: if I understand you right, you have the background name each time, with a few exceptions. I, on the other hand, never have it, except right after I clear the cache
[06:06:42] <Famic> I just tried with computedstyles, I have the same behaviour
[06:06:52] <johnkpaul> Famic: yes, that' strue, but more importantly, I am seeing it every time with getComputedSTyle
[06:06:52] <defaultro> good morning folks, I've seen some codes written by my officemate. It's Raphael. What is this library?
[06:06:55] <johnkpaul> oh, then I am very confused Famic
[06:07:08] <johnkpaul> ?g raphael.js @ defaultro
[06:07:10] <bot-t> defaultro, Raphaël—JavaScript Library - http://raphaeljs.com/
[06:07:14] <defaultro> thanks a lot
[06:07:36] <jedimorten> johnkpaul: thanks anyway, I tried $("#wrapper").find("p .colw4").addClass("your-new-class") before I asked here, so I guess the space between p and .colw4 was the trouble :)
[06:07:47] <Famic> johnkpaul: if you're very confused, then we're on the same page now oO
[06:07:54] <LordThumper> Hey does anyone know of a good content slider plugin?
[06:08:08] <andr0id> LordThumper: coda slider
[06:08:16] <johnkpaul> sorry, jedimorten, I didn't see your original response, yeah, if it is for width, I understand, but having img tags that are put into fixed width columns seems odd
[06:08:18] <andr0id> i am usin that one
[06:08:20] <johnkpaul> and the space is the decendent selector
[06:08:40] <Famic> LordThumper: slideAnything
[06:08:40] <johnkpaul> so p .col4 means all .col4 elements underneath a p tag @jedimorten
[06:09:02] <johnkpaul> Famic: yes, we are both confused, I'd start removing functionality from the page until you get it to as bare bones of a test case as you can
[06:09:14] <stenno|work> jedimorten, thats #css :)
[06:09:31] <johnkpaul> this might be a webkit bug, but I can't tell of any problem in your code, Famic
[06:09:32] <jedimorten> true story :)
[06:10:41] <Famic> johnkpaul: I reduce js to a bare minimum, nothing interferes
[06:11:12] <johnkpaul> not just js, also css and html
[06:23:59] <stygyan> guys, anyone working with jquerytools?
[06:24:46] <defaultro> johnkpaul, I've been playing the demos of raphael, that is so cool :)
[06:25:09] <johnkpaul> defaultro: yeah, it is, I've been playing much more with d3, but that's ie9+
[06:25:14] <stenno|work> meh, just canvas tricks
[06:25:19] <defaultro> what is D3?
[06:25:27] <johnkpaul> ?g d3js @defaultro
[06:25:29] <bot-t> defaultro, D3.js - Data-Driven Documents - http://d3js.org/
[06:25:35] <defaultro> cooling :)
[06:25:45] <johnkpaul> stenno|work: sure, but magic tricks are cool too ;)
[06:26:03] <stenno|work> hehe fair
[06:26:28] <Famic> johnkpaul: I reduced it to a bare minimum
[06:26:47] <Famic> I still have the issue except if I place the css directly in the html document
[06:28:38] <johnkpaul> Famic: can you make a jsfiddle that reproduces it minimally?
[06:29:09] <Famic> johnkpaul: I don't think so, as it seems the crucial point is that it's an external stylesheet, but I'll give it a try
[06:29:18] <johnkpaul> Famic: jsfiddle allows external stylesheets
[06:43:35] <_ramok> does anybody has an idea why this is not working in jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/6fYPE/3/ ?
[06:44:08] <jorick> What do I do if i want to perform a number of ajax requests in parallel and then callback when they all returned their data?
[06:45:03] <johnkpaul> ?when @ jorick
[06:45:04] <bot-t> jorick, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[06:45:11] <johnkpaul> hey bot-t, you're back!
[06:45:18] <johnkpaul> _ramok: did you try w/o jsfiddle?
[06:46:08] <johnkpaul> so jorick, you can pass all of your ajax calls as a parameter to jQuery.when and it will return a new deferred that represents all of those ajax calls together
[06:46:20] <Famic> johnkpaul: I couldn't make it work with jsfiddle but I've placed a testcase at http://demo.lindicible.com/temp/bkgbug/
[06:46:32] <johnkpaul> jorick: $.when(ajax1, ajax2, ajax3).then(function(ajax1response, ajax2response, ajax3response){})
[06:46:41] <Famic> I am now using an external image, and I noticed I have the problem with firefox too now
[06:47:14] <jorick> okay that looks like it might work. but what will happen if (some) of the ajax calls fail?
[06:47:33] <defaultro> off topic question, which is a better library, phonegap's or jquery mobile?
[06:47:53] <johnkpaul> jorick: then that won't work, it will only call the fail handler
[06:48:12] <johnkpaul> Famic: hmm, so the first time I loaded the page, I got 4 nones
[06:48:19] <johnkpaul> the second time, and it's working as I'd expect
[06:48:23] <johnkpaul> so wierd
[06:48:33] <johnkpaul> try removing the jquery dependence?
[06:49:02] <johnkpaul> defaultro: they are for completely different purposes, read up on them
[06:49:03] <Famic> johnkpaul: the more things I removed, the more often I had expected result, but it's still not really reliable
[06:49:24] <defaultro> oh ok
[06:49:24] <Famic> if you reload the page a certain number of times, you'll get a none
[06:49:26] <johnkpaul> Famic: yeah, I know, but the more things you remove, the more confident you can be when you write a webkit bug report :)
[06:49:46] <Famic> johnkpaul: nah, I mean it's still pretty random
[06:50:12] <Famic> it began happening a lot less when I placed the js in the html
[06:50:25] <Famic> it doesn't seem to happen at all if I place the css in the html
[06:50:38] <Famic> this is a cache problem (quide trendy nowadays)
[06:50:57] <johnkpaul> which makes it seem even more like a webkit issue, perhaps try searching their bug reports
[06:51:02] <stenno|work> if you are using chrome...
[06:51:08] <stenno|work> have fun clearing the js cache
[06:51:13] <Famic> well I'm having it with ff too now
[06:51:23] <stenno|work> in ff its shift+reload
[06:51:33] <stenno|work> in chorme, that works only partially concerning js
[06:53:02] <Famic> I've placed the js back into an external file, I'm having "none" most of the time
[06:55:48] <jsabeaudry> I can do $('#mycheckbox').prop('checked') but not event.target.prop('checked') in the change event handler? (Just starting out with jquery here)
[06:56:03] <johnkpaul> event.target is the bare dom element
[06:56:07] <johnkpaul> $(event.target).prop
[06:56:36] <johnkpaul> ^ @ jsabeaudry
[06:56:52] <jsabeaudry> johnkpaul, Ah, thank you very much, was not aware that jquery wrapped objects :)
[06:57:08] <johnkpaul> ah, yes, it does
[07:00:24] <shoky_> oi
[07:04:20] <Famic> http://demo.lindicible.com/temp/bkgbug/
[07:04:31] <Famic> safari shows "none" most of the times too
[07:07:54] <patrickvw> Hi
[07:09:10] <patrickvw> How can I check if the a detached item already is inserted with .insertAfter();
[07:10:46] <jbw> patrickvw, search to see if the item exists before you call insert ? e.g. $('ul.items li[data-id=99]').length == 0
[07:11:54] <niceguy> Hey guys
[07:12:22] <niceguy> Is there a way to inject default value into an input box with jquery
[07:12:32] <niceguy> because im working with a pregenerated input box
[07:12:35] <patrickvw> jbw, Thanx!!
[07:12:47] <niceguy> so i cant set the value myself
[07:13:10] <jbw> niceguy,  check if the input is empty and if it is set its value ?
[07:13:53] <niceguy> no i want to literally give it a default value once, on page load
[07:14:14] <niceguy> im not talking about inserting text
[07:14:18] <niceguy> but literally giving it a default value
[07:14:32] <jbw> isn't it the same thing?
[07:14:35] <niceguy> no
[07:14:36] <devmikey> Question: WHy doesn't this work:
[07:14:47] <niceguy> default value is value=""
[07:14:54] <niceguy> text is whatever the user types in
[07:15:00] <jbw> it's the same thing
[07:15:02] <niceguy> no
[07:15:12] <niceguy> if the user types something into the box, it wont change the value="" attribute
[07:15:15] <niceguy> so im asking
[07:15:21] <johnkpaul> niceguy: you'll need to add a form submit handler
[07:15:23] <niceguy> is there a way to change the value="" attribute in the DOM through jQuery?
[07:15:23] <jbw> whatever the user types in will be accessible via val() which is reading the value attribute
[07:15:34] <johnkpaul> in that event handler, you'll need to check if something is empty, and modify it to whatever default you want
[07:15:34] <devmikey> $('MyID').attr("src","externalhtml.html").anotherJqueryfuntion();
[07:15:56] <johnkpaul> devmikey: you're missing a # before MyID
[07:16:46] <niceguy> jbw: it's not the same thing. even if the user types something in you can still fetch the default value from the dom
[07:16:53] <Ivru> Hi
[07:16:55] <niceguy> but i dont know if its possible with jquery
[07:17:04] <niceguy> johnkpaul: i dont know what that means. im not an advanced user
[07:17:14] <TheEternalAbyss> greetings Ivru
[07:17:15] <jbw> niceguy, you seem to know what you're talking about so dig deeper the answer lies inside you
[07:17:20] <niceguy> johnkpaul: is that really the most effective way of fetching the default value of something?
[07:17:26] <niceguy> rather than the user input
[07:17:32] <TheEternalAbyss> use the force niceguy
[07:17:37] <johnkpaul> niceguy: that is the only way to do what you're trying to do
[07:17:39] <NoiseEee> niceguy: you're asking where to store a 'default value' ?
[07:17:47] <niceguy> johnkpaul: okay. thanks mate.
[07:17:48] <johnkpaul> there is nothing in the browser by itself that has a "Default" value in your sense of the word
[07:17:48] <Ivru> I'm trying to get event on an input having its name attribute starting with param... The problem is that I cannot intercept the event. Any idea ? http://pastie.org/private/y0ahs6my6ed1bxhzw1wjtg
[07:18:04] <niceguy> cheers
[07:18:07] <niceguy> thx all
[07:18:20] <jbw> what a creep
[07:18:46] <johnkpaul> haha
[07:18:48] <NoiseEee> i think he was looking for <input data-defaultvalue='Enter text here'> or something
[07:19:03] <NoiseEee> but it shall remain a mystery
[07:19:12] <johnkpaul> yeah, but he wanted that to be submitted with the form if the value was ""
[07:19:27] <johnkpaul> anyway, let's see if niceguy returns one day
[07:20:17] <johnkpaul> Ivru: so what's the issue?
[07:20:37] <johnkpaul> you don't need the quotes around param in your selector
[07:20:43] <Ivru> johnkpaul: that i cannot intercept the event
[07:20:54] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @ Ivru
[07:20:55] <bot-t> Ivru, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[07:20:57] <Ivru> changin |= to ^= solved by problem
[07:21:13] <johnkpaul> ok, great
[07:21:17] <stenno|work> there is |= in javascript?
[07:21:17] <Ivru> thanks
[07:21:26] <Ivru> Attribute Contains Prefix Selector
[07:21:40] <Famic> how come .append() doesn't seem to work in opera and ie with my testcase ? o_O
[07:22:04] <Hooloovoo> Famic: where's your testcase?
[07:22:16] <Famic> http://demo.lindicible.com/temp/bkgbug/
[07:22:18] <jbw> stenno|work, he's talking about the jquery selector he was using $('input[name|="param"]') .. but that said you can probably get the result you're looking for using a = (a || 'default');
[07:22:49] <stenno|work> eh i see
[07:22:57] <stenno|work> anyway there _is_ |= in javascript :D
[07:23:29] <jbw> there is, pretty cool, i didn't know that
[07:23:38] <ak87> Hello,how can i make each step of a for loop be executed with some seconds delay?
[07:24:09] <johnkpaul> stenno|work: have you ever actually seen that used in production code ?
[07:24:13] <jbw> ak87, maybe using setInterval or setTimeout?
[07:24:15] <johnkpaul> I guess if you're working on a math library
[07:27:23] <ARUN__> hi, I have three input fields in form#container element, can I select the input elements under the specified form#container element using this ? $('form#container input[type="text"], input[type="password"], input[type="email"]')
[07:27:53] <jbw> ARUN__, use :input .. $('form#container :input')
[07:28:34] <ARUN__> hmm okay
[07:28:36] <jbw> alternatively if you want to use your syntax you'll need to specify the full selector -   $('form#container input[type="text"], form#container input[type="password"], form#container input[type="email"]')
[07:29:01] <ARUN__> okay, but in css can we use this for selection ? form input[type="text"], input[type="password"], input[type="email"]
[07:29:18] <ARUN__> or do we have to specify the form#container after each comma
[07:29:43] <jbw> if you want to target just the password and email inputs in form#container then you need to specify form#container after each comma
[07:30:00] <jbw> if you want to target globally then drop the form#container .. it depends on your use case
[07:30:02] <Taloncor> Is there a (sane) way to determine if there are scrollbars for a given element and the height/width of said scrollbars?
[07:30:19] <ARUN__> jbw, thnx for clearing my doubt :)
[07:31:51] <ak87> jbw , i had to rewrite my script and found my mistake.Thanks!
[07:32:16] <jbw> np
[07:35:59] <anli_> What is the official jquery cookie download page?
[07:36:58] <devmikey> $('#MyID').attr("src","externalhtml.html").anotherJqueryfuntion();
[07:37:18] <anli_> Cant find a cookie plugin download
[07:39:31] <Famic> johnkpaul: are you on osx or windows ?
[07:39:45] <johnkpaul> osx, although there is a third option ;)
[07:39:50] <devmikey> $('#MyID').attr("src","externalhtml.html").anotherJqueryfuntion();
[07:39:58] <devmikey> WHat is wrong with that?
[07:42:43] <KatelyNix> Hi. A CSS, not a jQUery question -- but unique to a jQuery plugin.  I installed Superfish for menus.  I want to CSS-style the parent on hover over a submenu.  Examples from web cause the submenu to flicker wildly, and don't touch the parent. Here's my source+CSS: http://pastebin.com/WMSR6uVr.  What's the CSS style to modify the Superfish parent?
[07:50:59] <devmikey> ALright, more general.  How do you change an element's contents?
[07:51:13] <devmikey> source
[07:51:26] <devmikey> .attr("src",)... right?
[07:52:00] <shoky_> that changes an element's src attribute, yes
[07:52:22] <devmikey> does it actually change the source?
[07:52:27] <devmikey> apparently not
[07:52:28] <shoky_> what source
[07:52:31] <anli_> strange, when I try jquery tabs with the option cookie, the tabs plugin does not create a working tab set any longer
[07:52:35] <anli_> And I include jquery cookie
[07:52:36] <devmikey> the actual html
[07:52:42] <shoky_> of course not
[07:52:54] <devmikey> how do I do that?
[07:52:59] <devmikey> innerHtml?
[07:53:03] <shoky_> not sure what you wanna do
[07:53:04] <devmikey> Is there such a thing?
[07:53:12] <devmikey> change inner html
[07:53:22] <shoky_> ok so .html()
[07:53:25] <shoky_> or .text()
[07:53:50] <shoky_> src attribute has nothing to do with the innerhtml
[07:54:06] <devmikey> i c
[07:54:25] <devmikey> shoky: how do I specify a file for the html instead of raw htmlo
[07:54:39] <shoky_> a file from where
[07:54:45] <anli_> .load
[07:54:57] <shoky_> if you wanna load it by ajax, then yeah, .load
[07:55:28] <anli_> Where can I find a download link on http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie ?
[07:57:17] <rhino_> can anyone tell me why I am getting a  'ptmedvals.1' is null or not an object error in IE8?  here is my pastie:  http://pastie.org/3915569  By the way, it works perfectly in chrome, firefox, etc.
[07:58:38] <rhino_> shoky_:  any ideas?
[08:00:39] <shoky_> rhino_: your loop goes from 0 to 4 inclusive
[08:00:50] <shoky_> but you only have 4 elements in the array
[08:01:04] <rhino_> shoky_:  so how would I fix that?
[08:01:26] <devmikey> if you load innerhtml for say, a <table>, should it have the <table> tags or just the ontents thereof?
[08:01:32] <devmikey> contents*
[08:01:32] <rhino_> ah, change it to 3?
[08:01:35] <shoky_> make your loop go from 0 to 3?
[08:01:44] <shoky_> donno if thats the cause of your error though
[08:02:06] <anli_> I cannot make jquery tabs with cookies work
[08:02:20] <anli_> b.cookie is undefined
[08:04:53] <anli_> Ah, did not include the jquery cookie js properly after all
[08:06:48] <rhino_> shoky_:  it is still giving me that error, is there something wrong with the way I set up my array or am looping through it?  http://pastie.org/3915569
[08:08:31] <rhino_> shoky_:  I haven't updated that code, but I did change the loop to go from o to 3 instead of 0 to 4
[08:09:26] <vlad27aug> that may be because it encounters a value that is undefined or '' or the other values
[08:09:29] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[08:09:46] <vlad27aug> and when that happens you set the whole variable to be an empty array
[08:10:24] <vlad27aug> so when it tries to go to the next iteration it tries to access ptmedval[i]
[08:10:40] <catfired> hi
[08:10:43] <vlad27aug> and ptmedval[i] doesn't exist anymore
[08:10:51] <vlad27aug> I think that is why IE complains
[08:10:55] <catfired> i s there  a key value dictionary i can store stuff in jquery?
[08:11:27] <rhino_> vlad27aug:  so, how do I fix that?  Set the individual elements to ''?
[08:11:49] <rhino_> instead of setting the array to be empty
[08:12:04] <vlad27aug> I think that should work...yes
[08:12:27] <vlad27aug> catfired: you can store things in localStorage or sessionStorage
[08:12:43] <vlad27aug> it's not from jquery...but it's what you're looking for
[08:12:54] <rhino_> vlad27aug:  then how can I check that subsequent array to check if any of the elements are empty and throw the error msg?
[08:13:21] <catfired> whats localstorage or session storeage
[08:14:08] <vlad27aug> google it...it's a way to store things provided by each browser
[08:14:17] <vlad27aug> a key - value pair thing
[08:15:06] <vlad27aug> rhino_:  instead of setting that array to be empty you can set an 'error' variable to be true...and later on the second if to check for this variable
[08:15:22] <vlad27aug> you need to initialize it with false before the loop
[08:15:30] <rhino_> just realized how stupid that question was, LOL
[08:16:06] <vlad27aug> something like: var error = false; for() {..... if() { error=false; break; }}  if(!error) {  // do stuff }
[08:19:13] <lotus_> hiya!  I'm writing a bookmarklet and loading jquery dynamically.  What I'm running into is that, before running my bookmarklet, console.log($('body')); returns a body tag, after running my bookmarklet, console.log($('body')); returns "jQuery.fn.jQuery.init"
[08:19:44] <lotus_> What is jQuery.fn.jQuery.init and why is this the output of console.log(jQuery_collection) ?
[08:21:12] <diamonds> yo
[08:21:26] <diamonds> if I want to namespace an event, I do click.myNS
[08:21:37] <diamonds> then I can off('.myNS')
[08:21:44] <diamonds> if I want a subnamespace
[08:22:41] <lotus_> nevermind, I was loading an old version of jquery from the google cdn... don't copy paste code without reading it.
[08:22:48] <diamonds> is it click.mySub.myNS ?
[08:23:01] <diamonds> then I can unbind EITHER mySub.myNS or .myNS?
[08:23:35] <lotus_> pretty!
[08:24:29] <catfired> i dont think i can use localstorage or sessionstoreage cause i have to support ie 6
[08:24:36] <Brodingo> http://www.weather.com/weather/map/interactive/Austin+TX+78759:4:US
[08:24:39] <smplstk> ie6 wat

[08:25:33] <chepe263> newbie here
[08:25:42] <silverwind> catfired, because you
[08:25:50] <catfired> shut up
[08:25:50] <chepe263> i read the plugin autoring page but not what i was looking for
[08:25:58] <Brodingo> come on guys
[08:25:59] <silverwind> catfired, because you're handicaping 98% of your users to accomodate 2%

[08:28:41] <smplstk> cookies/sessions
[08:28:42] <NoiseEee> catfired: you can just store an object as a cookie and use it as a dictionary of sorts
[08:28:42] <catfired> im just gonna use an array
[08:28:58] <catfired> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5402180/does-jquery-support-dictionaries-key-value-collection

[08:29:44] <catfired> i mean it only needs to persist for that page
[08:29:45] <smplstk> chepe263: why do you need $.alert ?
[08:29:56] <smplstk> console.log not good enough?
[08:30:32] <chepe263> @smplsk is an example, i want a function to appy some special properties to just one element
[08:31:02] <chepe263> @smplsk in the long run, i'm going to have to use it a lot of times so i want to save time writing a jquery function
[08:31:23] <smplstk> chepe263: everything you need is here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:32:00] <chepe263> @smplstk i've read it alerady
[08:32:06] <silverwind> catfired, that's still stupid... Anyway, take a look at the IE UserData storage.
[08:32:10] <chepe263> i don't get it....
[08:32:40] <shoky_> $.alert = function() { ... }
[08:34:04] <smplstk> chepe263: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/phy6y/
[08:34:23] <smplstk> what's there to get?
[08:35:05] <chepe263> gracias @smplstk
[08:35:11] <chepe263> i'll try to change it

[08:35:44] <chepe263> gracias anyway
[08:36:59] <MacroMan> How do I do a selector for a name element? eg $('my_element_name').whatever();
[08:37:19] <silverwind> MacroMan, $('[name="rofl"]')
[08:37:28] <MacroMan> silverwind: Thanks
[08:37:35] <silverwind> You're welcome.
[08:40:22] <NoiseEee> catfired: so just use an object!
[08:41:06] <catfired> ya thats what im gonna do
[08:41:09] <catfired> use an object
[08:50:20] <AgentCarmichael> What code would I need for the following behavior: a status page that can be changed from red background to green background (e.g. green="I am online" red="I am offline")?
[08:50:38] <Brodingo> some css
[08:50:59] <AgentCarmichael> The goal would be to create a page that tells a visiting user of my webserver if I am online or offline.
[08:51:29] <AgentCarmichael> So with jquery I can change the physical state of a page?
[08:51:50] <Brodingo> jquery makes it easy to manipulate dom nodes
[08:51:55] <AgentCarmichael> Meaning, if I click a button and it changes to red background and I close the browser, will the resulting file's background code still be red?
[08:52:14] <Brodingo> not unless you save that somehow
[08:52:19] <AgentCarmichael> Darn.
[08:54:59] <rhino_> is it possibly to swap images onhover to elements that have been dynamically added to the dom with jquery?
[08:55:11] <shoky_> yep
[08:55:34] <Brodingo> ?on @ rhino_
[08:55:35] <bot-t> rhino_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:57:58] <rhino_> Brodingo:  the element is added perfectly to the dom, the only problem is that my onhover event doesn't work on that element
[08:58:36] <Brodingo> rhino_ on works to delegate hover events to new elements
[08:59:26] <rhino_> does .live do the same thing?
[09:00:03] <shoky_> live delegates all event handling to the document element
[09:00:10] <shoky_> don't use live
[09:00:36] <Brodingo> rhino_ live is deprecated in favor of on, if youre using new jquery you should use on
[09:00:40] <shoky_> use .on  to delegate the event handling to a container element (that is already in the dom when you call .on)
[09:01:23] <rhino_> k, tnx
[09:01:53] <shoky_> and i guess you'd need to use 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' events
[09:02:23] <shoky_> something like: $('#containerDiv').on('mouseenter', function(e) { ... }).on('mouseleave', function(e) { ... })
[09:02:29] <shoky_> sorry
[09:02:57] <shoky_> something like: $('#containerDiv').on('mouseenter', '.elementClass', function(e) { ... }).on('mouseleave', '.elementClass', function(e) { ... })
[09:03:21] <shoky_> where all your elements that you want to hover over have the class 'elementClass'
[09:03:42] <Parhs> hello guys... do you know any good gallery for jquery ?
[09:03:56] <Parhs> i am interested in gallery manager  to upload and sort images
[09:05:15] <shoky_> actually you could write it as: $('#containerDiv').on({ mouseenter: function() { ... }, mouseleave: function() { ... } }, '.elementClass' )
[09:06:17] <andr0id> hey guys, i have table with 4 fields: category, subcategory, type, quantity. i want to do the following: show only 1 row of each separate category, subcategory that has the same category, and finaly, type. it will look something like this: category: office , subcategory: pencils, type: a4, next row -> category:office, subcategory: pencils, type: some_type and so on. any idea on how to do that?
[09:06:17] <andr0id> its all written in php, but since i cant go there (invite only) can anyone help me with this?
[09:07:43] <andr0id> anyone?
[09:08:31] <Brodingo> ?ui tablesorter
[09:08:34] <bot-t> Brodingo, Tablesorter - http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-spf/tablesorter.html
[09:09:16] <rhino_> why does this simple function throw a syntax error?  http://pastie.org/3915569
[09:10:15] <Brodingo> you only need two functions
[09:10:38] <rhino_> Brodingo:  what do you mean?

[09:11:07] <andr0id> can anyone help me with the table sorting?
[09:12:08] <Brodingo> andr0id are you asking for php help?
[09:12:19] <catfired> i have a div how do i get all the inputs in it?
[09:12:36] <Brodingo> $('div input')
[09:12:58] <andr0id> Brodingo: yes, but i cant access the php channel(invite only)
[09:13:02] <andr0id> Brodingo: yes, but i cant access the php channel(invite only)
[09:13:09] <Brodingo> i think theres another php channel
[09:13:12] <Brodingo> ##php
[09:13:17] <Brodingo> or something
[09:15:09] <rhino_> Brodingo:  I still don't quite follow how I would do that?

[09:22:40] <lyrae> i have a hover event. if i hover the mouse over the elemnt really fast, say, 5 times. the event will call 5 times even after the mouse is resting outside of it. how can i stop it from happening?
[09:22:55] <shoky_> rhino_: hover is not an event
[09:23:02] <shoky_> you want 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave'
[09:24:29] <lyrae> shoky_: thanks. let me try
[09:25:01] <lyrae> $('.homebox-wrapper').hover(function() {
[09:25:04] <shoky_> well i was talking to rhino_ ;)
[09:25:08] <lyrae> where would mouseenter go in there?
[09:25:09] <lyrae> oh
[09:25:11] <lyrae> was so confused
[09:25:13] <shoky_> its fine to use hover like that
[09:25:43] <shoky_> lyrae: not sure what you want to stop from happening?
[09:27:03] <lyrae> shoky_: http://none.io  for working example
[09:27:19] <lyrae> if you hover the mouse over the box a few times, the menu will show and hide, even after you stop
[09:27:43] <shoky_> ok so that's what you want to stop, not the hover event
[09:27:54] <lyrae> technically yes
[09:28:21] <shoky_> then don't queue an animation unless you need to
[09:28:52] <Brodingo> shoky_ hover in jquery is an alias of mouseenter and mouseleave
[09:29:15] <shoky_> Brodingo: not the hover event, you're talking about the hover function
[09:29:40] <catcher> couldn't you also use $('.home-menu').stop.slideDown()/up()?
[09:29:49] <shoky_> yes
[09:29:56] <shoky_> @ lyrae
[09:30:03] <catcher> lyrae, $('.home-menu').stop.slideDown()/up()?
[09:30:06] <lyrae> on the hover out part?
[09:30:07] <catcher> :)
[09:30:11] <shoky_> .stop()
[09:30:18] <shoky_> on both
[09:30:29] <lyrae> let us try
[09:31:29] <catcher> lyrae, include the braces, .stop()
[09:31:31] <lyrae> not working. hold on let me look @ the docs
[09:31:32] <gho5t> if i do this.element.append("form") I'm still at this.element when I continue chaining, correct?
[09:31:41] <Brodingo> ?hover intent @ lyrae
[09:31:41] <caniuse> Brodingo: .hover(): Bind a single handler to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters or leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/

[09:32:14] <lyrae> http://hastebin.com/gudalubojo.coffee
[09:32:28] <lyrae> if that is the right way, it works on the first time, but not the other times you hover
[09:32:32] <lyrae> ok let me read
[09:32:40] <smplstk> bot-t died (again)
[09:32:45] <Brodingo> sonuva
[09:32:45] <smplstk> :/
[09:32:54] <Brodingo> needs more oil or something
[09:32:56] <smplstk> at least caniuse is here <3
[09:33:00] <Brodingo> or soulgems
[09:33:10] <Brodingo> caniuse sup?
[09:33:16] <smplstk> haha!
[09:33:18] <Brodingo> whoops.
[09:33:19] <Brodingo> haha
[09:33:23] <Brodingo> he shy
[09:33:23] <lyrae> worked in chrome, not firefox
[09:33:41] <smplstk> Brodingo: at least forever brings him back, Node.js++
[09:33:50] <smplstk> caniuse hi!
[09:33:56] <smplstk> hmm
[09:33:59] <smplstk> caniuse hi?
[09:34:03] <smplstk> lol
[09:34:04] <Brodingo> just dont ask him things! haha
[09:34:09] <smplstk> it's a feature!
[09:34:20] <Brodingo> he prefers question marks at the beginning of things
[09:34:23] <Brodingo> caniuse ?right
[09:34:31] <Brodingo> i guess not
[09:34:42] <smplstk> he's a work in progress.
[09:34:42] <Brodingo> you are one fickle lil bot caniuse
[09:34:51] <Brodingo> arent we all
[09:35:14] <gho5t> is there a way to do this: var form = this.element.append("form");
[09:35:29] <gho5t> meaning I want the newly appeneded item to be the context
[09:36:20] <shoky_> lyrae: try .stop(true, true)
[09:36:27] <rhino_> Brodingo:  When I use that code, I get no errors, but it does nothing at all, any ideas why?
[09:38:06] <Brodingo> rhino_ not sure man, a working demo would help if you can make one of jsfiddle.net
[09:38:15] <Brodingo> or lady
[09:38:19] <Lachezar> Do I need to put some Â«magicÂ» code in my page, so that jQuery-UI components look as expected?
[09:38:28] <smplstk> gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/rUmCy/
[09:38:35] <Lachezar> Other than including a theme...
[09:39:06] <gho5t> smplstk: ah right. danke
[09:40:33] <zps> wow i just came to know usefulness of jquery!
[09:40:38] <LuisSantos> I was wondering if when you disable all the radiobuttons in a group of radiobuttons you can still get the information of which radiobutton is selected?
[09:40:45] <shoky_> Lachezar: the .js and the .css
[09:41:10] <zps> highslide and slider is one of them!
[09:41:23] <Lachezar> shoky_: not enough it seems :( The autocomplete and calendar both have HUMONGOUS text size.
[09:41:31] <zps> is facebook is using highslide for photos any one knows?
[09:41:46] <shoky_> Lachezar: then you're doing something weird
[09:42:29] <zps> no one answeres :(
[09:43:53] <catcher> zps, looks like highslide isn't written in jquery..
[09:45:55] <smplstk> *with*
[09:46:06] <catcher> fair enough.
[09:46:43] <smplstk> zps: I doubt FB is using highslide, you can always view source and find out.
[09:46:47] <smykes> I have to populate a select with upwards of 2500 options i get via ajax call, its killing slower machines, is there a better way to do it then a for loop?  Better == faster
[09:47:00] <zps> yeah it is~
[09:47:13] <LuisSantos> I was wondering if when you disable all the radiobuttons in a group of radiobuttons you can still get the information of which radiobutton is selected?
[09:47:29] <zps> so what about facebook photos ??,smplstk
[09:47:56] * smplstk shrugs
[09:48:13] <smplstk> view source and find out?
[09:48:53] <zps> facebook source is just like piece of sand!!
[09:49:21] <zps> cant find any syntax in bunch of characters!
[09:50:08] <catcher> zps, are you talking about highslide.com?
[09:50:18] <zps> no facebook
[09:50:29] <catcher> is the highslide you're talking about at highslide.com?
[09:50:40] <smykes> should i append them one at a time or all at once?
[09:51:27] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquery: And with that, consider the baton passed to @jqcon for all your incremental conference updates, if you're into that sort of thing! â˜… http://bit.ly/JEUFoQ
[09:51:29] <zps> no i am talking about facebook.com when we click on photo it just enlarges ,that effect i m talking abt!!
[09:52:35] <catcher> zps, I'm still curious why you say highslide is jquery - you probably won't find help on it here, as it's not written with the jquery library.
[09:52:37] <rhino_> Brodingo, shoky_: thanks for your gelp, I finally figured it out
[09:53:55] <catcher> LuisSantos, I'm pretty sure disabled form fields won't let you get the value. Even if it worked in a couple operating systems, it may not work in all.
[09:53:58] <zps> hell, i came to know dat highslide is not from jquery but n1 of you know th photo enlargement effect of facebook sorry if i m irritating you!
[09:54:11] <catcher> LuisSantos, your best bet is probably to set a hidden field, or tuck it away with a .data value.
[09:54:13] <Brodingo> rhino_ happy to gelp anytime
[09:54:27] <LuisSantos> ok
[09:54:51] <LuisSantos> that's what I was thinking :/ but that would require a lot of work for my page
[09:55:39] <catcher> LuisSantos, a hack could involve enabling, getting the val, and re-disabling..
[09:56:34] <catcher> zps, not irritated, just making an important distinction.  Not sure what fb uses off-hand, it's quite possibly something they built themselves in js.
[09:56:43] <LuisSantos> catcher: that's a good idea I think, when I press the submit button right?
[09:57:19] <catcher> LuisSantos, hard to say timing without knowing more about the circumstances.
[09:57:41] <LuisSantos> ok
[10:00:02] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm trying to append a div, then remove a class from it to play a transition. must be doing smth wrong though...
[10:00:02] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/GQNqS/15/
[10:00:53] <walidvb> i did try several ways, but no luck.
[10:00:58] <wkmanire> walidvb: Try $.fadeIn
[10:01:16] <walidvb> wkmanire: i want some animation rather that fadeIn
[10:01:36] <walidvb> which is in the css code
[10:02:06] <wkmanire> I see
[10:02:11] <wkmanire> hmm
[10:02:30] <walidvb> (try adding and removing hidden to a star, you'll see)
[10:02:46] <walidvb> wkmanire: i never got delay to work for anything, btw
[10:03:07] <walidvb> i just realized i usually go with setTimeout(1000, function());
[10:03:16] <Brodingo> delay is for animation queue
[10:03:38] <walidvb> so i can ONLY do it after animate().delay().animate() ?
[10:03:54] <Brodingo> yes or other methods that use animate
[10:04:03] <Brodingo> fadeIn slideDown etc
[10:04:57] <walidvb> Brodingo: hmm. so if I do want to wait i do need to use setTimeout?
[10:06:00] <wkmanire> walidvb: Would you mind updating the paste with a couple of starts actually doing the animation?
[10:06:16] <wkmanire> walidvb: I want to see the effect you're going for.
[10:06:20] <walidvb> hm well... lemme check
[10:06:29] <Brodingo> walidvb yes or also check out this
[10:06:36] <wkmanire> stars*
[10:06:37] <Brodingo> ?g jquery dotimeout
[10:06:38] <caniuse> Brodingo: Ben Alman Â» jQuery doTimeout: Like setTimeout, but better - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[10:06:39] <shoky_> you can do delay before animate
[10:06:54] <ezio> is there a way to iterate over the members of an object?
[10:07:01] <shoky_> $.each
[10:07:09] <ezio> is there a js native way?
[10:07:34] <Brodingo> a for loop
[10:07:38] <shoky_> for (var a in obj) { ... }
[10:07:42] <wkmanire> ezio: Yes there is.
[10:07:47] <Brodingo> ezio but a master assassin such as yourself would use $.each
[10:07:51] <walidvb> wkmanire: hm the easiest way to see is to simply add and remove 'hidden' from a star's class, directly in the inspector
[10:08:10] <wkmanire> walidvb: I haven't seen anything animate at all.
[10:08:28] <ezio> Brodingo, yes but even i didn't have a hook blade until 60
[10:08:48] <ezio> Brodingo, why would i use that?
[10:08:54] <ezio> i can't imagine it's better for the compiler
[10:08:58] <walidvb> wkmanire: it works here.. you did add hidden to the classes of a star, right?
[10:09:00] <wkmanire> oh
[10:09:02] <wkmanire> there it goes.
[10:09:20] <wkmanire> So it just kind of plops down into the div.
[10:09:21] <Brodingo> just a lil easier i guess
[10:09:24] <wkmanire> is that what I should see?
[10:09:33] <walidvb> yeah kind of.
[10:09:46] <wkmanire> ezio: Premature optimization is the devil.
[10:10:05] <walidvb> wkmanire: i'm building a prototype of a smartphone app, decided to go with html rather than flash catalyst and other tools, i don't like that
[10:10:05] <ezio> wkmanire, but it's also just as easy to code
[10:10:30] <wkmanire> ezio: Only if you want to iterate every object on the prototype chain. :D
[10:10:33] <walidvb> this is just one of these 'reward' thingy, you know? just needs to work for this one presentation for school, nothing big, but soooooon
[10:10:34] <Brodingo> ezio just do whatever you feel comfortable doing
[10:10:37] <wkmanire> ezio: Otherwise you have to add more code to filter the objects.
[10:11:21] <dmsuperman> Can I use $.each to start from the end and iterate backward?
[10:11:30] <ezio> .each prevents the prototype from being copied?
[10:11:34] <wkmanire> ezio: You can also check out the iterator functions on Array.prototype. Such as Array.prototype.forEach.
[10:11:40] <wkmanire> look it up in MDN.
[10:11:51] <blindMoe> dmsuperman: you could reverse the array first
[10:11:52] <wkmanire> but beware, they don't work on some browser.
[10:12:05] <dmsuperman> blindMoe: I need the position to remain unmodified
[10:12:07] <wkmanire> I used the singular form on purpose there.
[10:12:26] <wkmanire> walidvb: Well, let's play with this and see what we cna do.
[10:12:27] <wkmanire> can*
[10:12:29] <blindMoe> dmsuperman: clone the array and then reverse the clone
[10:12:31] <catcher> dmsuperman, you could make a copy
[10:12:47] <dmsuperman> No I need the position to be unmodified inside the .each function
[10:12:48] <walidvb> wkmanire: and this would happen on page load, if possible.
[10:12:52] <dmsuperman> start at 10 and go back to 0
[10:13:02] <dmsuperman> I'm guessing not
[10:13:04] <walidvb> or rather, on data-role="page" load, if you know what I mean
[10:13:06] <blindMoe> dmsuperman: doesn't make sense
[10:13:11] <dmsuperman> Makes perfect sense.
[10:13:16] <MagePsycho> jQuery('#shipping:prefix, #shipping:street2, #shipping:region, #shipping:region_id').removeClass('required-entry').removeClass('validate-select');
[10:13:19] <wkmanire> walidvb: IFFFFFFF ya know what I mean.
[10:13:19] <dmsuperman> for(var i = 10; i > 0; i--)
[10:13:21] <MagePsycho> is not working for me ... any idea?
[10:13:26] <walidvb> hehe
[10:13:27] <blindMoe> the position would not be modified in the original array
[10:13:49] <dmsuperman> blindMoe: Right. And the .each function wouldn't know about the original array either
[10:13:49] <blindMoe> dmsuperman: how about you don't use $.each() and just do what you just pasted
[10:14:07] <dmsuperman> I obviously am aware of that. I came here to see if .each supported alternate iteration
[10:14:15] <dmsuperman> You could just say "it does not"
[10:14:25] <shoky_> .each is just a for loop
[10:14:32] <dmsuperman> I am aware of that.
[10:14:37] <blindMoe> dmsuperman: whatever.. if you can't figure that out from the docs then I feel bad for you
[10:14:51] <dmsuperman> Thanks for your mature help blindMoe
[10:14:59] <blindMoe> dmsuperman: haha anytime
[10:15:23] <tw2113> are we behaving in here?
[10:15:32] <dmsuperman> Instead, I'm just going to do var x = array.length - x;
[10:15:35] <walidvb> wkmanire: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/GQNqS/
[10:15:36] <dmsuperman> So I can continue to use .each
[10:15:36] <walidvb> done
[10:15:38] <walidvb> and thanks
[10:15:42] <walidvb> :)
[10:15:58] <walidvb> wkmanire: it does look quite ok, no?
[10:15:59] <MagePsycho>  jQuery('#shipping:prefix, #shipping:street2, #shipping:region, #shipping:region_id').removeClass('required-entry').removeClass('validate-select'); ==> not working any idea?
[10:16:28] <wkmanire> walidvb: Neat.
[10:16:41] <wkmanire> walidvb: try to figure out how to do it without that implied eval.
[10:16:45] <wkmanire> It isn't necessary.
[10:16:58] <walidvb> wkmanire: the eval?
[10:17:12] <wkmanire> Yeah, you're passing javascript as a string literaly to setTimout.
[10:17:17] <wkmanire> Same thing as eval'ing.
[10:17:21] <wkmanire> literal*
[10:17:34] <wkmanire> I need to go eat lunch, back in a few.
[10:18:08] <walidvb> wkmanire: i don't care, act, hehe. it's a project for school, they won't look at the code, and it'll never be used, so...
[10:18:13] <walidvb> wkmanire_away: bon appÃ©tit!
[10:18:15] <shoky_> MagePsycho: you need to escape your colons.  e.g.  jQuery('#shipping\\:prefix, #shipping\\:region, etc
[10:18:31] <MagePsycho> shoky_ that's great man
[10:19:19] <MagePsycho> shoky_ : you rock man
[10:19:26] <shoky_> LoL
[10:26:15] <catfired> can javscript variables persist when the browser refreshes?
[10:26:41] <BillCriswell> catfired: Nope. You would need to use local storage or a cookie or something.
[10:26:42] <silverwind> carlos2010, localstorage/sessionstorage/cookies, that's about it
[10:26:50] <silverwind> Err
[10:26:54] <silverwind> catfired
[10:27:09] <ezio> if i use .each can i write to the object?
[10:27:41] <silverwind> ezio, sure (If I understand the question properly)
[10:28:00] <ezio> is there a jquery bot?
[10:28:08] <silverwind> Yeah
[10:28:18] <silverwind> ?eval "HI!";

[10:30:22] <cheesypoof20> I'm new, what is the correct way of doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/hgPdg/4/ I had it working before I tried to add the checkbox functionality.
[10:30:24] <ezio> ?eval "{ var a = [{id:\"15\"}, {id:\"12\"}]; $.each(function(){this.name="test"'}); a[0].name;}"

[10:30:43] <caniuse> ezio: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[10:30:48] <ezio> you whore
[10:31:18] <ezio> ?eval "{ var a = [{\"id\":\"15\"}, {\"id\":\"12\"}]; $.each(function(){this.name="test";}); a[0].name;}"
[10:31:18] <caniuse> ezio: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[10:31:40] <shoky_> you need to pass what you're iterating over to $.each ...
[10:31:47] <shoky_> it's not magic
[10:32:43] <silverwind> shoky, Indeed... but still.. the bot doesn't have jquery
[10:33:03] <silverwind>  ?eval var x = [{}, {}]; $.each(x, function() {this.lol = "lol"; }); x[0].lol;
[10:33:06] <shoky_> ?eval document

[10:33:10] <caniuse> silverwind: 'ReferenceError: $ is not defined'
[10:33:12] <silverwind> See?
[10:33:45] <shoky_> even when it had jq it was only 1.4.2 :(
[10:35:20] <djQuery> when using the syntax of $('<p></p>', {text: 'something', class: }
[10:35:21] <silverwind> shoky, still better than no jquery.
[10:35:27] <wkmanire> I'm back.
[10:35:54] <wkmanire> I remember 1.4.2 being pretty kick ass.
[10:36:03] <wkmanire> I used it quite a bit.
[10:36:11] <djQuery>  when using the syntax of $('<p></p>', {text: 'something', class: 'red'})   it doesnt seem to get the css class. am I using class wrong?
[10:37:18] <aphid> jshint usually complains about using unquoted 'class' in that context.
[10:37:43] <shoky_> yah quote text and class
[10:37:59] <shoky_> or just class
[10:38:11] <aphid> it shouldn't matter, it's "technically reserved" as a future keyword
[10:39:07] <aphid> is there a difference between $('<p></p>'[...]  and $('<p/>'[...] ?
[10:39:22] <shoky_> unlikely
[10:40:00] <shoky_> why shouldn't it matter, if it's a reserved word
[10:44:03] <jeebster> hi guys. I have a few anchor tags on a page and I'd like the widnow/scrollbar to jump to the tag location on the screen. any good approaches for tackling this?
[10:44:34] <wkmanire> jeebster: Set window.location.hash to "#myanchorid"
[10:45:55] <jeebster> I'll try that out. thanks wkmanire
[10:46:11] <jeebster> will that approach work for any elements with IDs or only anchor ID?
[10:47:05] <wkmanire> jeebster: Only for anchors.
[10:47:31] <wkmanire> jeebster: Hash changes are in style. :) You should read around the internet about it.

[11:36:13] <wkmanire> You should be using the value attribute instead of these data attributes.
[11:36:21] <horelicious> wkmanire I have a fantasy about doxing the staffers and tracking them down one-by-one for a brutal raping!  I will take a cialis beforehand and then smoke some meth so that after tying them down to their own beds, I can jizz in and out of their asses all night long until they bleed and their faces are covered in my cum!
[11:36:43] <wkmanire> ajpiano: ^
[11:36:45] <cheesypoof20> The value attributes are used by the shopping cart for the cart dropdown descriptions.
[11:37:09] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: bummer. Any way you can choose shorter attributes? he he he
[11:37:13] <wkmanire> I think "price" would do nicely.
[11:37:15] <horelicious> cheesypoof20   I confide in you that    I have a fantasy about doxing the staffers and tracking them down one-by-one for a brutal raping!  I will take a cialis beforehand and then smoke some meth so that after tying them down to their own beds, I can jizz in and out of their asses all night long until they bleed and their faces are covered in my cum!
[11:37:37] <cheesypoof20> I do have control of the markup though... I haven't investigated modifying the way the shopping cart works though.

[11:45:19] <M4d3L> hi. what is the best way to get the real hight of a div?
[11:49:20] <Brodingo> ?height
[11:49:20] <caniuse> Brodingo: .height(): Set the CSS height of every matched element. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[11:49:33] <Brodingo> M4d3L ^
[11:53:30] <walidvb> NoiseEee: and, unrelated to my case here, what if I add an element to my DOM, for example a hard-coded anchor, with a specific js to be run onClick, then it won't be there when the event handler is set(unless i specifically re-run the event handler 'setter')
[11:53:57] <walidvb> so that anchor won't handle that event, will it?
[11:54:14] <andr0id1> can anyone help me on how to get this working for multiple rows, not just 3? i get the rows from a database. here's the link: http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/?js=true
[11:54:27] <NoiseEee> walidvb: or you use event delegation, via on:   $('#parentOfAnchor').on('click','a',function() { //hey this fires whenever an <a> is clicked within me! });
[11:54:44] <NoiseEee> walidvb: ^^ do that once, add as many/few <a> as you like and they'll all fire that
[11:54:58] <walidvb> aha, i didn't know this one
[11:55:14] <eyaculado> walidvb OMG pici...  Tengo muchas ganas de violar tu culito apretado hasta que te desangres por el ano.  FumarÃ© el cristal para poderme venir tantas veces hasta el punto de llenar tu puto recto con mi semen.  ajajajaja   SerÃ¡s mi puto. :D
[11:55:16] <walidvb> can i do the same using the click() syntax?
[11:55:36] <walidvb> and how come it is bot invasion today??
[11:55:57] <NoiseEee> walidvb: you should use .on for just about all events, esp. event delegation
[11:56:07] <walidvb> ok. reason?
[11:56:47] <NoiseEee> give http://api.jquery.com/on/  a perusal i guess :)
[11:59:18] <ckb> How can I check to see if jQuery UI is loaded?
[11:59:47] <ckb> .show('slide', {direction:"right"}, 1000); isn't working.. but I'm getting no JS errors on the page other than when trying to use this
[12:00:29] <walidvb> no time to read this atm, but i will.

[12:08:54] <ajpiano> did you see that $r ban
[12:08:58] <snover> yes
[12:08:59] <snover> it says
[12:09:01] <snover> gecos
[12:09:07] <snover> â€œThis type matches on a client's realname, or gecosâ€
[12:09:08] <snover> what is that
[12:09:16] <ajpiano> lol
[12:09:34] <ajpiano> it does a check to see if the person has any geckos who are named in the account field
[12:09:36] <ajpiano> probly not
[12:10:14] <snover> confusing
[12:10:28] <snover> i would think that is the same as *!*dyn.telnor.net*@*
[12:10:28] <ajpiano> webchat populates the realname field tho
[12:10:53] <ajpiano> naw cause they're coming in over webchat so the dyn.telnor isn't in there

[12:14:08] <snover> makes sense now
[12:14:12] <snover> if you ignore the gecos part
[12:14:30] <youngin> fuck the gecos cart
[12:14:32] <ajpiano> yeah the gecos are just a diversion
[12:14:33] <youngin> we dont play that part

[12:16:18] <Hornet> no unexpected margins or positioning are affecting it
[12:16:28] <Hornet> any likely suspects?
[12:16:39] <Hornet> other likely suspects, I should say
[12:19:36] <PhonicUK> bleh, .droppable is really buggy :\
[12:20:07] <PhonicUK> greedy: true works fine for nested elements, but there's no way to prevent event propogation for sibling elements that overlap
[12:23:30] <andr0id1> do you want to know a very good song?

[12:28:54] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: http://jsfiddle.net/hgPdg/11/
[12:28:57] <wkmanire> wow, sorry for the 30 minute delay
[12:29:01] <wkmanire> I got wrapped up with something else.
[12:29:25] <wkmanire> I gave you a kick-starter there. Hopefully you'll be able to finish your implementation from it.
[12:30:45] <gho5t> you're welcome
[12:31:10] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: Just a word of caution. Be careful with floating point arithmetic in Javascript. .1 + .2 !== .3
[12:31:26] <wkmanire> When you're adding up money it can go poorly. :)
[12:31:37] <Hornet> or more likely just make you poor
[12:31:55] <Hornet> flops are pains in the backside
[12:32:04] <gehsekky> wkmanire: out of curiousity, do you have a source on that so i can read up on it?
[12:32:09] <Hornet> whoever invented the idea of fuzzy numbers needs their head read
[12:32:19] <Hornet> just google it, it's an old problem
[12:32:51] <wkmanire> gehsekky: ^ what he said. Javascript actually just implements a standard.
[12:32:55] <cheesypoof20> Awesome, thanks for your efforts wkmanire.
[12:33:00] <wkmanire> So, no different than a lot of other languages.
[12:33:19] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: Also, you may want to use the jQuery methods for map and replace the "reduce" with a for loop or something.
[12:33:26] <gehsekky> wkmanire: thanks, i've seen this in other languages, just haven't read up on the specific js implementation
[12:33:34] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: THose are javascript 1.6 functions which don't work on some well known browser.
[12:34:43] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods
[12:34:44] <wkmanire> there's the link.
[12:35:05] <cheesypoof20> Are you sure its adding up correctly. The checkbox seems to be adding 10 instead of 5.
[12:35:32] <wkmanire> It will accumulate because the product price input gets updated each time the price changes.
[12:35:45] <SeanLazer> i feel like i'm missing something obvious here: i'm trying to observe a hidden field for changes and then run an event when they happen.  the value of the hidden field is being changed by other jquery code, is there a way to do this?
[12:35:55] <SeanLazer> .change or .on('change') is not going to work for this instance
[12:36:30] <wkmanire> SeanLazer: Really? Well if that doesn't work you can set up an interval on it and trigger your own event.
[12:36:53] <SeanLazer> wkmanire: .change doesn't fire if the value is changed by javascript in the first place, right?
[12:37:13] <wkmanire> SeanLazer: I think it probably should fire, but I could be wrong.
[12:37:39] <SeanLazer> wkmanire: i'm probably oversimplifying the question here, it's actually a number of hidden fields, in the event that ANY of them change i need to run a function.  i'll check again but i think .change requires a blur event
[12:37:53] <wkmanire> Ah right.
[12:38:38] <cheesypoof20> From a usability standpoint though wkmanire, a visitor might check then uncheck that option. One would expect it to add then subtract, not add then add?
[12:38:49] <Hornet> hm, found it... looks like fadeOut was affecting the invisible elements too still
[12:39:01] <Hornet> which is somewhat broken but nvm
[12:39:27] <jdaddy> hello. i'm looking for some input on jquery plugin design. i'm developing a plugin that creates a new element, from a set of specified elements, that the plugin operates on. i.e. newElement = $.myPlugin.createNew( $( "#first" ), $( "#second" ), $( "#third" ) ); $( newElement ).myPlugin( "someMethod" ); is there a cleaner way to design this? i'm a little lost since the plugin examples attach the plugin to a single, preexisting element
[12:39:37] <wkmanire> cheesypoof20: Hey, I just illustrated how to do the math, you make the behaviors behave.
[12:39:39] <wkmanire> ha ha ha
[12:42:02] <ravenzz> jdaddy can't you have a collection of elements instead of 3 parameters?
[12:43:24] <jdaddy> ravenzz: yeah that was just a quick example. the part i'm stuck on is how to create the new element gracefully. since it doesn't already exist on the dom i can't do $( "#newElement" ).myPlugin() to initialize it
[12:44:17] <walidvb> NoiseEee: can I access variables the same way? i guess not, as they are declared in $(document).ready()...
[12:44:46] <NoiseEee> walidvb: you could always set them as window variables
[12:45:04] <NoiseEee> walidvb: window.availableToAll = 'something';
[12:45:12] <walidvb> nice
[12:45:14] <walidvb> thanks
[12:45:17] <walidvb> bad practice though?
[12:45:21] <NoiseEee> not necessarily
[12:45:25] <walidvb> okay.
[12:45:30] <jdaddy> i guess i'm just asking, would an extra method on jQuery.myPlugin to create the element intended to be operated on by jQuery.fn.myPlugin, be bad design?
[12:45:53] <walidvb> i'm doing everything very uglyly atm, as i need this fast and only doing what i want it to do
[12:46:22] <walidvb> but good opportunity to test different things without implementing the whole surrounding code properly ;)
[12:52:21] <lathan> anyond have a question?
[12:52:58] <jdaddy> me!
[12:53:03] <lathan> ok
[12:53:26] <jdaddy> wait no i don't thanks though!
[12:53:30] <lathan> lol
[12:54:19] <walidvb> me!
[12:54:21] <walidvb> neither
[12:54:43] <walidvb> lathan: looking for karma? ;)
[12:54:49] <wkmanire> SeanLazer: http://jsfiddle.net/ydL2C/
[12:54:49] <lathan> lol
[12:54:58] <wkmanire> SeanLazer: What do you think about that?
[12:55:07] <lathan> a tad bored...
[12:56:01] <SeanLazer> wkmanire: I cooked up something similar with setInterval but more tailored to my current situation.  that's a really handy generalized version though!
[12:57:57] <walidvb> well, lathan, if you know an easy and good way to drag and drop on a mobile, i'll take it!
[12:58:00] <walidvb> :D
[12:58:03] <lathan> walidvb, sorry
[12:58:14] <walidvb> lathan: not that bored, then ;)
[12:58:19] <lathan> connect it to the Wii ?
[12:58:23] <lathan> haha
[12:58:36] <wkmanire> SeanLazer: Ah ok.
[12:58:39] <walidvb> haha
[12:58:39] <wkmanire> I was a bit too slow.
[12:58:40] <wkmanire> heh
[12:58:59] <SeanLazer> wkmanire: well your version is a lot more thorough than mine
[12:59:00] <SeanLazer> :)
[12:59:53] <saba> Does anyone know what's wrong in the following? var foo = []; foo[$(this).attr('name')] = $(this).val(); foo will be [undefined, "0"]. The attr is "2" and the value of this is "0"
[13:01:39] <malydok>  foo[$(this).attr('name');] <- ? or maybe just declare a var to hold attr above
[13:02:31] <saba> malydok: that is not valid syntax. The problem is not the syntax, but the approach. Why do I get 'undefined'?
[13:03:05] <imachuchu> I have a js function that attaches a bunch of functions to some fields in a div. I then want to clone the div and reattach the js functions. Is there an easy way to, given a div on the page, detach all attached js functions?
[13:03:33] <lathan> imachuchu, if by attach, you mean events, then: .clone(true)
[13:04:03] <sanjayb> lathan: passing true to clone() also clones event handlers?
[13:04:15] <lathan> yes
[13:04:25] <sanjayb> lathan: wow, i think im going to cry. thanks.
[13:04:26] <imachuchu> lathan: not what I asked, but definetly what I want. Let me try it!
[13:04:33] <lathan> that's what the Jquery docs say....: http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[13:04:43] <lathan> jQuery docs: they help
[13:05:36] <sanjayb> lathan: ah, the deepDataWithEvents was added in 1.5 ... i remember needing this some years ago when it did not exist ..
[13:06:51] <walidvb> how can i set the color of a div according to it's width?
[13:07:46] <sanjayb> walidvb: lol, what do you mean .. ? something like if ($(this).width() > 500) { $(this).css("color", "black"; }   ?
[13:07:49] <supermanjnk> When using a lot of ajax calls. Is it best practice to keep all my custom JS in one file. Or is it better to load the js needed for that function when the call is made?
[13:07:56] <walidvb> oh. and animate it(the smaller the redder, the bigger the bluer)
[13:08:15] <walidvb> sanjayb: yes, but the width changes with time(and it's animated)
[13:08:41] <sanjayb> walidvb: how does the width change? on browser resize or with some function?
[13:08:53] <ravenzz> walidvb are you fine with random colors?
[13:09:02] <walidvb> I don't think this is possible, but is it not possible to bind a color style to it's width? i mean OOP like? :D
[13:09:53] <walidvb> sanjayb: i set a new width, and i use css3 for transition
[13:10:07] <sanjayb> walidvb: well, you could bind to a .resize() method of window() or so .. but otherwise, wherever you're changing the width, you'd EITHER, fire a custom event like .trigger("widthChanged") on the element and then bind to that ..
[13:10:18] <walidvb> but actually, for my purpose, my bar will always go from blue to red, so i can set my initial color to blue, set a final color, and transition between both
[13:10:41] <sanjayb> walidvb: ah okay, nice ... um, can you also not animate the color with a css3 transition ?
[13:11:00] <walidvb> sanjayb: i never worked with custom event before, don't know too much about them, but should :/
[13:11:05] <walidvb> sanjayb: i think so, yes
[13:11:21] <walidvb> pretty sure, act, it's done quite a lot for text on anchors and so
[13:11:34] <sanjayb> walidvb: yes, for this design pattern, custom events are nice -- you can just do .trigger("foo") and .bind("foo", function() { doSomething();}); on any jquery element
[13:11:49] <walidvb> but i could create an event that 'watches' the width of an element, is that what you're saying?
[13:12:15] <sanjayb> walidvb: in this context of wanting to combine css animations with a js listener .... its an interesting problem ;)
[13:12:39] <walidvb> hehe i like css3 transition, i do almost everything animated with that
[13:12:39] <sanjayb> walidvb: you could poll the DOM for the width, but that doesn't sound like so much fun .. do you have code for this you can post somewhere ?
[13:13:16] <sanjayb> walidvb: yes - i like using css3 transitions for animations these days too - i just have also run into cases where i want something done with JS, and something with CSS, and sometimes getting the two to talk to eachother can be a bit weird, i think.
[13:13:33] <walidvb> sanjayb: act, not really, i'm doing a prototype of a iphone app, didn't like the dedicated soft, so went with html, have to hand in on monday, but they won't look at the code at all
[13:13:45] <walidvb> that's why i'll take whatever works for now
[13:14:04] <walidvb> but yeah, you can see my wip on vbbros.net/sb/meal.html
[13:14:12] <sanjayb> walidvb: hm, so i'd first try to also animate the colour with css3 trans .. although, tbh, i dont fully understand your use-case ..
[13:14:14] <walidvb> or vbbros.net/sb/avatar.html
[13:14:21] <NoiseEee> can i search for an element that has particular data associated with it via .data(),  or instead of setting via .data() should I just use a data- attribute and then search by attribute?
[13:15:04] <walidvb> NoiseEee: i think you can do smth like $('[data=yourdata]')
[13:15:40] <walidvb> sanjayb: well... it's an app for diabetics, they should compose a meal, and once they confirm it, it shows the amount of carbohydrates there is in it
[13:16:18] <sanjayb> NoiseEee, I *think* you'd have to set a data- attribute and use $('[data-foo=...]')
[13:16:27] <walidvb> i'm thinking of after the page transition, a bar could fill up to a point, and if it's not enough, it would be blue, if it's too much it would be red, if it's good it'll be green
[13:16:47] <walidvb> NoiseEee: sanjayb i'm pretty sure that works
[13:16:49] <walidvb> ?data
[13:16:50] <caniuse> walidvb: .data(): Returns value at named data store for the first element in the jQuery collection, as set by data(name, value). http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:17:23] <Chopps> hey guys, is there a channel to hire jquery coders?
[13:17:28] <walidvb> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[13:17:37] <walidvb> Chopps: i guess here is a good start :D
[13:17:39] <imsky> Chopps, this is the channel
[13:17:48] <sanjayb> walidvb - about NoiseEee's question - yes, I just think the question was if there was somewhere to do like $('[data-foo=blah]') for data attributes set with .data() (and not in the DOM)
[13:18:03] <johnkpaul> Chopps: there is #css-lance that has javascript posts as well I believe
[13:18:09] <walidvb> does .data() not update the DOM?
[13:18:10] <NoiseEee> indeed sanjayb
[13:18:20] <NoiseEee> walidvb: no, it just associates data with a jquery object
[13:18:27] <walidvb> oho, i did not know that
[13:18:34] <sanjayb> walidvb: I'm fairly certain .data() does not update the DOM .. this is why you can get different values for .data("foo") and .attr("data-foo")
[13:18:39] <walidvb> (sry i'm still kind of a noob)
[13:19:02] <walidvb> ok
[13:19:36] <johnkpaul> NoiseEee: there's some way to hack jQuery.cache to search, but that's probably not a good idea. What are you trying to do? is there a way taht you can add a class to flag these special elements
[13:19:54] <sanjayb> walidvb: any-how .. so, for your use case -- you could do something primitive like if ($('#element').width() > 300) { $('#element').css("color", "green") } ... right ? and just a bunch of ugly if / elses ?
[13:20:37] <walidvb> sanjayb: i guess, i was going for the gradient transition, but i need to check if that's possible
[13:20:45] <walidvb> lemme jsfiddle that quickly
[13:20:50] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul: just loading some elements dynamically that i might need later, would rather not stuff things into their IDs.... so i'd look-up by a "client key" data attribute that can be passed from elsewhere
[13:21:05] <sanjayb> walidvb: well, if you want to animate colours in jquery, just include the jquery color animation plugin and then just use .animate() ..
[13:21:07] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul: so at some point i'll need to look up those elements by their 'key'.  probably makes more sense to use data-clientkey='something' and then just search $([data-clientkey='something'])
[13:21:20] <sanjayb> walidvb: if you want to combine css3 gradients AND animate them, maybe interesting :-)
[13:21:29] <ravenzz> walidvb go with an array of width > color
[13:21:47] <ravenzz> and indexOf
[13:22:03] <sanjayb> walidvb: yes, something like what ravenzz suggests ... put the width: colour into some sort of data structure
[13:22:12] <johnkpaul> ah, yes, I agree with your last thought NoiseEee
[13:22:18] <johnkpaul> that makes more sense than searching through $.data
[13:22:23] <NoiseEee> thanks johnkpaul
[13:22:25] <walidvb> ... guys..... http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[13:22:29] <walidvb> ooops
[13:22:32] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/PA35b/
[13:22:33] <johnkpaul> np
[13:22:35] <walidvb> i told you ;)
[13:23:02] <lathan> in which browsers?
[13:23:06] <lathan> wanna try that in IE 7?
[13:23:44] <sanjayb> walidvb: man, css transitions just FEEL so much nicer than js animations ;-)
[13:23:44] <lathan> walidvb, FF doesn't do the webkit transition
[13:23:59] <walidvb> change -webkit to -moz
[13:24:03] <walidvb> sanjayb: right?
[13:24:06] <walidvb> i love them
[13:24:09] <walidvb> use them all the time
[13:24:20] <walidvb> plus it makes a lot of things much easier
[13:24:42] <walidvb> for example, if you have two states, just have two classes, and toggleClass()
[13:24:42] <sanjayb> walidvb: yea - been working with a friend who does the css more, and im constantly blown away these days - and it does make a lot of things easier ..
[13:24:44] <lathan> and it may be work in IE 10
[13:25:04] <walidvb> lathan: there is a js that translates it all to IE i think
[13:25:09] <sanjayb> walidvb: i just wrote a jquery image gallery plugin last week or so to do a simple image gallery where the transitions are managed in css
[13:25:09] <walidvb> called... PIE?
[13:25:17] <walidvb> sanjayb: link=
[13:25:19] <walidvb> ?
[13:25:25] <sanjayb> walidvb: lemme push it somewhere, one moment
[13:25:40] <lathan> walidvb, but then its js....lol....yah, its cool
[13:26:02] <ravenzz> walidvb btw you could use css3 animations, so you can do anything in css using keyframes
[13:26:21] <sanjayb> walidvb: http://bhangar.com/tmp/jquery.cssgal.js
[13:26:23] <walidvb> lathan: well you write css3, and it creates all the js according to that
[13:26:30] <walidvb> i heard it works pretty well!
[13:26:32] <lathan> ah
[13:26:46] <lathan> walidvb, just not as optimized.....
[13:26:50] <walidvb> sanjayb: aha and the result?
[13:26:54] <sanjayb> walidvb: you can see it being used here: http://testjosephs.bhangar.com/
[13:27:36] <sanjayb> PIE works okay - but my approach with this is generally that IE users see the content change, but don't get to see the animations, tough luck :-)
[13:28:00] <tw2113> css3pie is a waste of resource imho
[13:28:02] <walidvb> well, i always say: F**** IE users
[13:28:04] <walidvb> :D
[13:28:06] <lathan> lol
[13:28:23] <xmaddness> I usually just say f*** ie
[13:28:26] <walidvb> i tell my clients i dev for the rest
[13:28:29] <xmaddness> although 9 isn't bad
[13:28:33] <ravenzz> tw2113 i would agree :p
[13:28:35] <xmaddness> 8 though, ugh
[13:28:46] <walidvb> (i do have understanding clients, and not corporate for the most ^^)
[13:28:47] <xmaddness> just enough users to still fully support it
[13:29:21] <walidvb> sanjayb: nice. i defo need to start working with objects and so, ftm i don't at all and it's ugly
[13:29:28] <sanjayb> I think the fall-back of css3 transitions of it just not animating, but otherwise working fine is generally acceptable. yes, i would be very clear about these things up-front with clients and not take them if they're not okay with it (or quote a million dollars :))
[13:29:51] <walidvb> sanjayb: hehe right
[13:29:58] <walidvb> i think my library is closing :(
[13:30:05] <walidvb> ppl are leaving
[13:30:09] <sanjayb> walidvb: yea - the problem with javascript, imo, is only that there's all these different approaches and one gets confused -- and there's a couple things that are awkward / take a bit to get used to .. but otherwise the OOP in JS is actually fabulous.
[13:30:16] <walidvb> it's 22:30, too, so makes sense i guess
[13:30:29] <xmaddness> Here they expect chrome, firefox, ie9 to have the nice stuff, ie8 and 7 are okay and are labeled as a "degraded experience"
[13:31:02] <walidvb> sanjayb: i totally believe you. prob is i started with js for very simple things, and never learned the 'good practices', although i should have some from C++
[13:31:57] <sanjayb> walidvb: yea, i started programming with javascript mostly and then moved to php and now python, so very often when speaking to more serious programmers, coming from C or so, I feel very from the opposite end of things.
[13:32:10] <walidvb> haha
[13:32:11] <walidvb> i bet
[13:32:58] <lathan> well, no matter how "serious" you are, there are always those that say you are doing it the wimpy way, and you should do it their hardcore way...
[13:33:24] <johnkpaul> you don't use vim? hahah ;)
[13:33:38] <sanjayb> lathan: yea, i always feel like the wimp:) - but in the end, when shit hits the fan, im generally the one who can get the damned thing to actually work :/
[13:33:47] <lathan> lol
[13:33:50] <walidvb> and ravenzz i agree i could go with animations as well, i do, but most of the things i do only do state1->state2 in my case
[13:33:57] <lathan> johnkpaul, mostly....(well, vi)
[13:33:57] <walidvb> johnkpaul: i hate vim
[13:34:11] <lathan> walidvb, its hard to learn, but once you do...its powerful
[13:34:29] <walidvb> lathan: nano does fine for me
[13:34:31] <sanjayb> yea, I use Gedit .. the wimpiest of 'em all :-)
[13:34:32] <aclockworkpeter> anyone here worked with jQuery mobile?
[13:34:36] <walidvb> call me wimp ;P
[13:34:38] <lathan> walidvb, left h, right l, up k, down j
[13:34:42] <walidvb> aclockworkpeter: started today
[13:34:43] <sanjayb> aclockworkpeter: I did one project a few months ago ..
[13:34:48] <lathan> sanjayb, its still better than windows notepad
[13:34:49] <aclockworkpeter> what is the proper way to put small text on the bottom of one page
[13:34:56] <walidvb> lathan: haha foshizzle
[13:35:04] <sanjayb> lathan: lol - when I was on windows, notepad is all I used, but yea- glad I left that life many years ago now :-)
[13:35:15] <lathan> sanjayb, notepad++ is nicer when you have to be there
[13:35:17] <walidvb> i'll leave this to sanjayb, he might know more
[13:35:34] <walidvb> but try data-role="footer"
[13:35:34] <sanjayb> aclockworkpeter: put it in the <div data-role="footer"></div> element or so on the page ?
[13:35:47] <walidvb> (y) i got it right \o/
[13:35:59] <lathan> walidvb++
[13:36:04] <aclockworkpeter> my footer element isn't what it needs to be for the small text
[13:36:07] <aclockworkpeter> so I can't use that...
[13:36:22] <aclockworkpeter> unless I can somehow override the footer element
[13:36:37] <aclockworkpeter> and when I used the footer element, it didn't get placed on the bottom of the screen
[13:36:37] <walidvb> ok here is really closing... sry guys, nice talking though.
[13:36:43] <sanjayb> aclockworkpeter: what do you mean .. ? you can add another element inside the footer and then style that with a small font-size or so ?
[13:36:46] <lathan> bye @ walidvb
[13:36:54] <walidvb> i'll keep working later at home, so maybe see you later, depending on what continent you are
[13:37:22] <sanjayb> aclockworkpeter: the footer should get placed at the bottom - that's what its for - otherwise managing these fixed positioned things is weird on mobile. are you sure the issue was not something else (if footer did not show at bottom?) ?
[13:37:40] <sanjayb> walidvb: take care - i sleep soon (india) :)
[13:37:53] <walidvb> gora ;)
[13:38:48] <aclockworkpeter> I don't want the footer to be encapsulated in black... how do I go about this
[13:39:25] <aclockworkpeter> and I did <div data-role="footer" data-position="fixed"> text </div> and it won't go on the bottom of the screen
[13:39:47] <walidvb> found how to btw (problem was that red->blue goes through violet, not green): have 2 classes with 2 animations, one red->green, second red->green->blue, and set class according to width
[13:40:00] <walidvb> aclockworkpeter: i had this earlier, check the 'display' of your div
[13:40:24] <sanjayb> aclockworkpeter: hm, im not soo familiar with jquery mobile .. but if you don't want black, some data-theme stuff ? .. and do you have a data-role="header", data-role="body" (or was it content?) and data-role="footer" all inside a data-role="page" ?
[13:40:56] <sanjayb> walidvb: w00t! nice ;-)
[13:41:12] <walidvb> makes sense, no?
[13:41:34] <aclockworkpeter> what do you mean check the display of the div?
[13:41:41] <walidvb> display:block
[13:41:46] <darkknightcz> hi, how to fire a function when element is "visible" on screen? (or if you scroll at the end of page)
[13:41:52] <lathan> aclockworkpeter, the css property: display
[13:41:59] <walidvb> btw little thing with css3: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/GQNqS/
[13:42:47] <lathan> darkknightcz, try an "inview" plugin, http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/
[13:43:08] <sanjayb> walidvb: hey, that's cool :-)
[13:43:13] <darkknightcz> lathan thanks
[13:43:14] <lathan> darkknightcz, otherwise you have to bind to resize, and then check the ScrollTop() compared to the offset().y and width()
[13:43:34] <darkknightcz> yeah, i wanted to avoid that :) thanks fo that "in view" plugin :)
[13:43:49] <lathan> darkknightcz, look for others like it...not sure which one is the best
[13:45:04] <dailylinux> hey #jquery
[13:45:28] <dailylinux> can i get a bit of help on this one http://fpaste.org/QG1Z/
[13:46:15] <lathan> ok, what's wrong with it dailylinux
[13:46:24] <lathan> dailylinux, besides that there's no success callback on the $.post
[13:46:28] <dailylinux> the post value of toaddress is not being set to #email, but instead to 'Email sent' which is a feedback given to user after hitting the send button
[13:47:20] <lathan> well, .animate does not make the rest of the function wait for it to finish
[13:47:30] <lathan> dailylinux, move the $.post line right before the animate line
[13:47:37] <lathan> dailylinux, put line 6 before line 3
[13:47:39] <dailylinux> lathan, i'm totally new to JS/Jquery
[13:47:59] <dailylinux> lathan, ah, ok, will try! Cool
[13:48:14] <lathan> dailylinux, animate sets an animation rolling in the "fx queue", but the regular thread of javascript keeps going.
[13:48:33] <walidvb> hm.. should css animation stay at the 100% state after it's done?
[13:49:16] <lathan> walidvb, you mean does animate keep the number in % instead of in exact pixels?
[13:50:01] <walidvb> lathan: nope, rather if i set any style at 100% that is different than at the start, should it not keep the style set at 100%?
[13:50:14] <dailylinux> lathan, i see
[13:50:28] <lathan> walidvb, ah....demo? lol....I don't get a ton into animate
[13:50:42] <walidvb> found a work around, but surprised
[13:50:45] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/PA35b/
[13:51:06] <walidvb> changeaddClass('toRed') to addClass('toGreen') for workaround
[13:51:32] <walidvb> got it?
[13:51:53] <sanjayb> dailylinux: im not sure exactly what you were going for, but see if this makes sense: http://fpaste.org/9OBE/
[13:52:40] <lathan> sanjayb, fix the $(this).
[13:52:55] <lathan> sanjayb, the selector is: '#email'
[13:53:07] <dailylinux> lathan, still same issue
[13:53:23] <sanjayb> lathan: oh, i thought i did that - ergh, sry
[13:53:26] <dailylinux> the toaddress is being set to 'Email sent' it seems
[13:54:32] <lathan> sanjayb, and why would you pull the xhr from $.post and then later add a .success to it?
[13:54:49] <lathan> sanjayb, shouldn't it just be $.post(url,{data}, function(){ success })
[13:55:04] <sanjayb> lathan: could do it either way, sure.
[13:55:42] <sanjayb> lathan: lately I've started enjoying using .success() and .fail() .. trying to get into using these Deferred objects more ... maybe better to have it as the callback for example though
[13:55:54] <dailylinux> lathan, hey, it looks ok :)
[13:56:20] <dailylinux> lathan, although i don't get the email, which was the problem... but i got the answer on this Jquery issue :)
[13:56:59] <lathan> sanjayb, oh....those are new 1.7 flashy things.....
[13:57:06] <lathan> sanjayb, I'm still living in the past in 1.4 :P
[13:57:13] <dailylinux> lathan, thanks!
[13:57:19] <lathan> dailylinux, np
[13:57:24] <lathan> bot-t: where are you?
[13:57:30] <dailylinux> lathan, :)
[13:57:46] <walidvb> is it bad to addClass(null) ?
[13:57:53] <lathan> walidvb, what's the point?
[13:58:03] <lathan> walidvb, I have no idea what it would do
[13:58:08] <nFFF> lol :D
[13:58:26] <lathan> walidvb, any advantage that it does for you is probably undocumented, and therefore subject to change at any time
[13:58:29] <walidvb> i set a class according to a test, but one test result implies no class set
[13:58:32] <nFFF> craziest question Ive seen in a while
[13:58:34] <sanjayb> lathan: lol, yea - i got scolded by this 19 year old couple months ago for "nested callbacks" that are apparently so yesterday .. still haven't grokked Deferred fully, but trying to get with the cool kids :/
[13:58:49] <walidvb> lathan: as i said, needed until monday, then gone ^^^
[13:58:59] <nFFF> walidvb, you can set the class as '' to reset it
[13:59:05] <lathan> sanjayb, the cutting edge isn't necessarily where the cool kids are....lol
[13:59:06] <walidvb> nFFF: true that
[13:59:08] <walidvb> thx
[13:59:08] <nFFF> or 'delete' any classes on the element
[13:59:17] <lathan> ?removeClass
[13:59:17] <caniuse> lathan: .removeClass(): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[13:59:17] <walidvb> nFFF: this i don't want
[13:59:30] <sanjayb> walidvb: sorry, unrelated, but do you have any idea of css keyframes are supported in anything but webkit?
[13:59:43] <lathan> ?g keyframes outside of webkit
[13:59:43] <caniuse> lathan: Build a Pure CSS Slideshow With Webkit Keyframes | Design Shack - http://designshack.net/?p=19905
[13:59:49] <lathan> fail
[13:59:52] <walidvb> sanjayb: just add a prefix, and you get ff and opera
[14:00:03] <lathan> -moz
[14:00:06] <walidvb> -o , or -moz
[14:00:13] <sanjayb> walidvb: ah! and the syntax is consistent across the vendor prefixes?
[14:00:17] <walidvb> yep
[14:00:23] <lathan> why can't they just standardize on those prefixes....
[14:00:25] <sanjayb> walidvb: woohoo! ok, nice. did not know.
[14:00:41] <walidvb> most styles also exist with no prefix, but not all are supported by all browser
[14:00:53] <walidvb> i think transition for example is also supported by webkit
[14:00:55] <lathan> excatly....standards are *not* overrated!
[14:00:57] <sanjayb> there's some good auto css prefixing tools out there by now.
[14:00:57] <walidvb> not too sure though
[14:01:11] <walidvb> sanjayb: ?
[14:01:14] <walidvb> what is that?
[14:01:28] <lathan> walidvb, prob something that reads your css and duplicates all those custom prefix cmds
[14:01:30] <sanjayb> walidvb: that will go through your css files and generate the appropriate vendor prefixes for you ...
[14:01:35] <lathan> score!
[14:01:40] <sanjayb> lathan: :P
[14:01:54] <Chopps> hey guys, i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/FtR4d/ the select elements have 2 options besides the default option, 1 option displays 1 field, the other option display 2 fields, each select displays the fields on his own row, my issue is how to make the display work if each select has a different option selected?? ive been trying for 2 days and i cant make my head around it, hope u guys
[14:01:54] <Chopps> can help me out
[14:02:07] <walidvb> nice
[14:02:17] <sanjayb> lathan: an approach i liked is one where you could write your css without vendor prefixes and it would generate a separate css file with the same selectors with the vendor prefixes for you .. so, hypothetically, few years down the line, you can just throw away that file ..
[14:02:17] <walidvb> ok really have to go now :D
[14:02:33] <walidvb> that would be cool
[14:02:37] <lathan> walidvb, you have said that many times
[14:02:39] <lathan> :)
[14:02:40] <walidvb> could a js do that? not really
[14:02:44] <walidvb> lathan: i know...
[14:02:49] <walidvb> but i like you guys :P
[14:02:52] <walidvb> hahaha
[14:02:54] <walidvb> well
[14:02:56] <walidvb> farewell
[14:02:58] <sanjayb> walidvb: there's a JS solution as well - look at Vera Lerou, i think she had some things
[14:03:06] <sanjayb> walidvb: but I'd recommend a server-side solution.
[14:03:14] <lathan> walidvb, a js could read in a css file and then create an inline style block with the additions
[14:03:15] <sanjayb> walidvb: ok, go already :-)
[14:03:24] <walidvb> gone
[14:04:39] <sanjayb> lathan: i think this attempts to do that: http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/
[14:04:43] <lathan> ?multiple-selector @ Chopps
[14:05:07] <lathan> ?Chopps please put some of those lines together $('.label1, .label2, ...').hide()
[14:06:49] <lathan> bye
[14:07:10] <sanjayb> Chopps, and, not sure you want to set .css("display", "") .. either .css("display", "block") or .css("display", "inline") or however would probably be better.
[14:09:43] <poppiez> does anybody know what happened to this profiling tool? http://ejohn.org/blog/deep-profiling-jquery-apps/#postcomment the jquery-profile.js file can't be found anymore
[14:10:49] <Chopps> ok sanjayb, i will try not leaving the display empty, i will also do what lathan said, thanks
[14:13:08] <sanjayb> poppiez, hm, the link does seem to be down - not sure if it exists somewhere else -- perhaps let J Resig know he's got a broken link politely and hope he fixes it .. ? :)
[14:16:57] <poppiez> sanjayb: will do - I found a gist tho: http://raw.github.com/gist/1546548/74065da859f5caa833745b77820e7697358aa8dc/jquery-profile.js
[14:17:18] <sanjayb> poppiez: nice 'un
[14:19:48] <raj> how do i break out of the current .each() without affecting the parent .each()?
[14:20:06] <raj> I can't `break`
[14:22:09] <darkknightcz> raj: what exactly do you wanna do?
[14:22:44] <NCS_One> raj: return true goes to next each
[14:23:09] <raj> gotcha
[14:23:18] <NCS_One> raj: return false stops all
[14:25:13] <raj> i'm actually having trouble with this code. If data['item_text'] exists in any of the $mydiv.find('.item-text'), I don't want to append $("<span class='item-text'>" + data['item_text'] + "</span>") to $mydiv
[14:25:37] <Dr-Bombay> raj: returning false from an inner each function does not make the outer each function return anything
[14:25:38] <raj> but it just keeps removing the first item
[14:25:44] <raj> ah ok
[14:25:44] <raj> cool
[14:26:15] <shoky> r_a_j__
[14:26:30] <shoky> D-I_d u_WaTch ?!?
[14:28:32] <raj> yeahhh
[14:28:39] <raj> good episode
[14:28:49] <shoky> who tf did theon burn?
[14:28:52] <raj> was that season finale?
[14:28:56] <shoky> *Spoilerz*
[14:28:56] <shoky> nope
[14:29:30] <raj> remind me again where theon originally came from?
[14:29:39] <raj> cuz i thought he was supposed to be good
[14:29:43] <raj> and he seems bad
[14:29:45] <shoky> heh
[14:29:49] <raj> is he related to lanisters?
[14:29:55] <shoky> no he's a greyjoy
[14:30:20] <shoky> and he was taken to the stark's when he was a boy
[14:30:22] <raj> what're the greyjoy's about?
[14:30:32] <shoky> well, you met his dad & sis
[14:30:37] <raj> he's the bastard from the prostitute that ned stark brought home?
[14:30:40] <shoky> they're about iron and war, it seems ;)
[14:30:46] <shoky> no, thats jon snow
[14:30:55] <shoky> theon isnt related to starks by blood
[14:31:03] <raj> oh ok
[14:31:13] <shoky> and yeah, seems he turned bad ;)
[14:31:25] <raj> oh, the dude that diddled his sister
[14:31:26] <raj> yeah
[14:31:26] <shoky> i'm expecting a bloody death for him
[14:31:31] <shoky> lol yeah
[14:31:33] <raj> so what was his role before hand?
[14:31:48] <raj> like before he rode to his dad
[14:32:00] <shoky> mmm he was just "brothers" with robb stark
[14:32:05] <shoky> but not a REAL brother
[14:32:15] <StevenCodes22> what todo
[14:32:30] <shoky> and robb sent him to his dad to try to get an alliance or smth. but his dad & sis dont like teh idea.
[14:32:46] <shoky> and he feels he needs to prove himself to them
[14:32:52] <shoky> so he turned evil crazyz
[14:33:10] <shoky> so he burned the kid?
[14:33:34] <Dr-Bombay> wait what channel am I in again?
[14:33:52] <shoky> u got a jquery issue?
[14:33:56] <raj> ohhh
[14:33:57] <raj> right
[14:34:04] <raj> that's what his story was
[14:34:09] <shoky> ;p
[14:34:12] <raj> k, def makes more sense now
[14:34:16] <raj> lol
[14:42:07] <raj> how do I get 'hellothere1' from <span class=â€‹"item-text">â€‹hellothere1â€‹</span>â€‹ ?
[14:42:17] <raj> .html() and .text() give me blank responses
[14:44:33] <shoky> mmm they shouldn't
[14:44:44] <catcher> raj, .val()
[14:44:54] <shoky> whut
[14:45:01] <raj> nope, val() is empty too
[14:45:05] <catcher> wait, nm
[14:45:12] <catcher> not val, html & text should work
[14:45:25] <shoky> raj you got smth else wrong then
[14:46:19] <raj> console.log($mydiv.find('.item-text')) gives me <span class=â€‹"item-text">â€‹hellothere1â€‹</span>â€‹
[14:46:39] <shoky> what about .length
[14:46:46] <sanjayb> raj: uh - console.log($mydiv.find('.item-text').text()) , no ?
[14:46:59] <raj> length is 1
[14:47:12] <shoky> hrm
[14:47:30] <sanjayb> raj, in your above console.log, you're not calling either .text() or .html() .. just logging the element itself, no?
[14:47:34] <hope> hello there i want to ask how to put a parameter in making your own plugin in jquery.
[14:47:40] <raj> yeah
[14:47:51] <raj> just to show that it shows up properly
[14:48:04] <raj> but when looking for the text() or html(), it shows up blank
[14:48:37] <shoky> raj , it gives you what you wrote inside array brackets [] ?
[14:48:53] <raj> yeah
[14:49:26] <sanjayb> raj: oo, that's interesting then .. you got a more complete bit of code to paste ?
[14:49:35] <nanotechnoloG> is there a way to auto close a modal dialog window after a submit?
[14:49:43] <raj> k, let me put something on fiddle
[14:50:50] <sanjayb> hope: as in .. you want the user to be able to pass some options to the plugin?
[14:51:00] <walidvb> sanjayb: haha you're still here, too
[14:51:01] <walidvb> ^^
[14:51:27] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DvY7b/
[14:52:12] <raj> how odd
[14:52:54] <shoky> pizza!
[14:53:32] <raj> nomnomnom
[14:53:36] <shoky> ^^
[14:56:31] <raj> omg
[14:56:32] <raj> i got it
[14:56:41] <raj> i forgot console.log() has a delay
[14:56:49] <raj> so I was appending the text to it after the console.log
[15:07:25] <raj> what's an efficient way to see if sometext is not found in any of the .someclasses in $someplace.find('.someclass'), then append that text within a new <span class='someclass'>sometext</span>
[15:08:38] <Gsingh> Hi, I'm using the validation plugin for jQuery I noticed something curious the URL "http://www.g" is considered a valid URL. Is this correct according the whatever standard or rules determine a valid URL?
[15:10:04] <Dr-Bombay> gsingh: yes
[15:10:21] <Gsingh> cool, can you point me to a source?
[15:10:26] <sanjayb> Gsingh: well, i guess in theory .g could be the TLD (equal to .com) and www the second-level ..
[15:10:45] <raj> Gsingh, sikh?
[15:10:48] <Gsingh> yeah
[15:10:53] <raj> nice, we're taking over
[15:11:08] <Gsingh> uhhh.. if you say so.
[15:11:09] <sanjayb> Gsingh: would parse as a valid URL. unless the URL parser has a hard-coded list of valid TLDs, which I think is not desirable.
[15:11:37] <tocka> Hey
[15:11:44] <Dr-Bombay> https://www.google.com/?q=url+rfc
[15:12:12] <Gsingh> sanjayb: hmmm, yeah I guess I can see that. Thanks!
[15:12:35] <raj> second sikh in here in 3 days
[15:12:41] <Gsingh> Dr-Bombay: thanks!
[15:13:05] <Dr-Bombay> keep your petty ethnic politics out of this channel please
[15:13:05] <tocka> I have got 50 <img src's> and I want to add height and width properties to all of them, im doing this like $('img').height('200px').width('300px');  but it only changes one of the image's width and height, how could I change it on all of them?\
[15:13:11] <sanjayb> Dr-Bombay, nice nick. had to say it.
[15:14:04] <sanjayb> tocka: try $('img').each(function() { $(this).height('200px').width('300px'); });
[15:14:13] <Gsingh> tocka: add a class to your images say "change_image" and then just set there widths
[15:14:33] <sanjayb> tocka: what Gsingh said ^^ is probably best.
[15:14:58] <tocka> Gsingh at this point class is not an option, because im generating the height according to the width of the image
[15:17:05] <Gsingh> tocka: so you want to add different widths and height to each image, just select all the elements by class get their heights and change the width according?
[15:17:18] <tocka> Did that, it works:)
[15:17:54] <tocka> Just wondering now is it possible to add the width and height not by style="height:100.. but <img src width="x" height="y" /> ?
[15:18:28] <sanjayb> tocka: instead of .height('200px') use .attr("height", "200").attr("width", "300") for eg.
[15:18:50] <sanjayb> tocka: not sure exactly why you'd want that.
[15:19:40] <tocka> sanjayb im using wookmark plugin and it requires for the image height and wight to be defined that way
[15:20:08] <sanjayb> tocka: cool - then .attr("width", "200") should set it that way.
[15:21:32] <tocka> ffs, it works but it doesnt.. :D when i set the w and h by hand its ok, but when i do it through jquery - its a mess
[15:21:52] <tocka> its like i didint even define width and height at all
[15:21:54] <tocka> arghh.
[15:22:32] <sanjayb> tocka: lol, what do you mean? care to paste some code?
[15:24:25] <gamingdroid> I have the following very simple form, http://dpaste.com/748698/, but it seems I'm getting two submits instead of one. Anyone have any clue?
[15:25:44] <thorie> your click() action doesn't stop the submit from happening
[15:25:56] <tocka> sanjayb lets say if I define the image dimensions by hand like <img src="image.jpg" width="200" height="100" /> it all works perfectly but for every image the height differs so when im trying to add the height through jQuery using height() or attr() functions its like that plugin doesnt see those lines then O_o
[15:26:03] <tocka> and there is really no code for real :/
[15:26:14] <thorie> gamingdroid: instead of capturing the click of the submit button, try capturing the "submit" event of the form object
[15:26:37] <sanjayb> tocka: well, are you instantiating the plugin after you have set the width and heights ?
[15:26:44] <thorie> gamingdroid: that way, if they just press "enter" on a field, it will submit the form like most people expect it to
[15:26:48] <tocka> Uuuu
[15:26:50] <tocka> Thats an idea
[15:26:52] <tocka> :D
[15:27:47] <gamingdroid> thorie: Use something like this: $("form").bind("submit",...
[15:28:05] <tocka> sanjayb <33333 thanks :)
[15:28:26] <thorie> gamingdroid: even then, though, you might need e.preventDefault() or e.stopPropagation() something like that... i forget
[15:28:30] <raj> what's an efficient way to see if sometext is not found in any of .someclass in $someplace.find('.someclass'). If it's not found, then append that text within a new <span class='someclass'>sometext</span> and append to $someplace
[15:28:32] <sanjayb> thorie: and remember to either return false; or do like .bind("submit", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... }); if you don't want it to actually submit
[15:28:55] <thorie> sanjayb: yeah i was helping gamingdroid :-)
[15:28:55] <gamingdroid> sanjayb: what do you mean, if I don't want it to actually submit?
[15:29:23] <sanjayb> gamingdroid: uh, sorry - i didn't look at your code - if you don't want to actually make the GET or POST request to the action url defined in your form (triggering a page reload).
[15:29:58] <thorie> gamingdroid: for example, if you validate that a field is entered incorrectly, you might not want it to actually submit
[15:30:01] <sanjayb> thorie: lol - sorry, got helper and helpee mixed up there. 4am, brain fuzzy, i should sleep.
[15:33:30] <gamingdroid> thorie & sanjayb: thanks! I got a 500 error, but it seemed to work! :D
[15:40:31] <walidvb> can someone explain to me the following, please? if you go here: http://vbbros.net/sb/meal.html click on a food item, and then on go
[15:41:09] <wkmanire> How can I make jQuery do my site like ebay? I want to make an auction site for selling jQuery plugins.
[15:41:36] <walidvb> how come the transition only works on the colr, and not on the width?
[15:42:55] <walidvb> btw, if you change the width manually, the transition does work.
[15:43:36] <gamingdroid> what does it mean that you are doing cross domain?
[15:46:19] <tmerrill99s> anyone wanna check out an "if NOT IE" conditional comment for me?  i'm losing my mind up in here.
[15:46:36] <sanjayb> gamingdroid: trying to make an 'ajax' request to a different domain from the current webpage.
[15:47:15] <tmerrill99s> and by "if NOT IE" I'm talking loading js and not css (just so we're clear)
[15:47:43] <gamingdroid> sanjayb: so let say, I download a page from example.com and i try to submit a login to example.com/members/login. That isn't a cross domain? If I submitted to example2.com/members/login, then that would be a cross domain?
[15:48:05] <sanjayb> gamingdroid: yes, that is correct.
[15:48:26] <gamingdroid> sanjayb: would loading the jquery library from google matter?
[15:48:46] <sanjayb> gamingdroid: no. its relative to the page url.
[15:48:50] <tmerrill99s> anyone?  this is gonna be easy.  i promise.
[15:49:05] <wkmanire> walidvb: meal.js:107 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[15:49:13] <sanjayb> tmerrill99s: lol, paste link to code - someone may look - asking "will someone look" is not going to help ...
[15:49:18] <tmerrill99s> http://pastebin.com/ZRE5dCGB
[15:49:42] <tmerrill99s> sanjayb, then how do i get someone to know about my issue?
[15:50:19] <walidvb> wkmanire: that shouldn't change anything, because the bar does go from 0 to 80%, but only the transition doesn't work...
[15:50:25] <walidvb> but i'll check that
[15:50:39] <walidvb> removed..
[15:51:29] <tgodar> off topic i know but anyone here used Google Visualization API?
[15:51:55] <tmerrill99s> http://pastebin.com/ZRE5dCGB
[15:52:15] <walidvb> wkmanire: you see what I mean?
[15:52:33] <wkmanire> walidvb: That page doesn't appear to be working at all for me.
[15:52:35] <wkmanire> I'm using chrome.
[15:52:45] <sanjayb> tmerrill99s: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html - look at the syntax for !IE - its a bit different .
[15:52:49] <walidvb> wkmanire: hm me too.
[15:53:01] <walidvb> what do you mean by not working at all?
[15:53:24] <wkmanire> walidvb: Big white blank page.
[15:53:30] <walidvb> by the way, you guys feel like testing the app once it's done? would love some remarks
[15:53:46] <gamingdroid> for some odd reason HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH header isn't set....
[15:54:00] <wkmanire> I don't see any food items.
[15:54:02] <sanjayb> walidvb: doesn't work at all for me either - error in console: invalid token on line 107 or so
[15:54:24] <walidvb> ....... it works for me, haha. and for my iPhone..
[15:54:57] <wkmanire> walidvb: Not working on my noteBook.
[15:54:59] <walidvb> could it be the cache?
[15:55:05] <sanjayb> walidvb: but you have a : instead of a ; on 107
[15:55:08] <wkmanire> It did this on my first access.
[15:55:13] <walidvb> of which file?
[15:55:25] <wkmanire> walidvb: Open up the debugger
[15:56:02] <walidvb> i do have it open
[15:56:05] <walidvb> the console, you mean?
[15:56:07] <sanjayb> walidvb: meal.js
[15:56:30] <walidvb> corrected
[15:56:43] <walidvb> but that's weird, that it's working on my devices...
[15:56:54] <walidvb> perhaps an old meal.js in the cache or something
[15:59:45] <sanjayb> walidvb: urgh, figure some way to syntax check your code, my friend :-)
[15:59:49] <walidvb> there, now it works
[15:59:52] <walidvb> sry
[16:00:09] <sanjayb> walidvb: hm, giving me a syntax error on 114 - lemme refresh ..
[16:00:13] <walidvb> came home, homies chiling on the sofa, took a couple of puffs ;)
[16:00:24] <sanjayb> i can never figure out how to get chrome to clear cache of a page and refresh easily - argh.
[16:00:40] <walidvb> yeah you always have to go to the prefs
[16:00:56] <sanjayb> walidvb: cool, works now
[16:01:04] <walidvb> finally
[16:01:06] <Wass|> hi
[16:01:16] <walidvb> so, see my problem?
[16:01:25] <sanjayb> walidvb: yea - pressing ctrl-shift-r 2-3 times seems to clear cache, but never certain
[16:01:33] <sanjayb> walidvb: yea.
[16:01:44] <sanjayb> walidvb: are you setting the width initially to 0 ?
[16:01:49] <walidvb> (i should probably focus on the implementation instead of this, but this is bothering me right now...)
[16:01:50] <walidvb> yes
[16:02:01] <ZLAPPER> hello everyone, I'm developing a web app using jQuery Mobile and Google Maps, and I'm getting a strange behavior when clicking on the map: the tap/click event happens to be misplaced consistently some pixels below the actual tap/click
[16:02:05] <ZLAPPER> has anyone ever got a the same problem? I'm using a Motorola Defy (Android-CM7) for testing. It works fine on Chrome/Windows 7, as well as on a Galaxy Nexus.
[16:02:12] <walidvb> you can see there: http://vbbros.net/sb/meal.html#mealconf
[16:02:15] <walidvb> you'll see
[16:02:45] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: links?
[16:03:16] <ZLAPPER> walidvb: http://danielgarcia.co/trappt/mapa.php
[16:03:29] <ThemNuts> i have this class in an input, now i'd like to use this class dynamically and use it as such: $("." + myVar ).click( function() { do stuff }); but i can't seem to find how to get the class in a var and use it as shown, is it even possible?
[16:03:40] <walidvb> sanjayb: and you can change the bar size manually to see that the transition IS working
[16:03:56] <sanjayb> walidvb: what if you set $carboProgress.css({'width': '0px'}) or so before setting the width to $carboTotal+'%'  ?
[16:04:08] <sanjayb> walidvb: it possibly does not have an initial width to animate from.
[16:04:11] <Wass|> I have a page that I'm trying to load with jquery with $get method, the page loads fine but all the javascript inside isn't executed.  anyway idea ?  there's my code sample : $(document).ready(function(){Â $.get("pageview.php",{ wfid : "1", view : "2", vorder : "3" },  function(result){  $("loader").html(result); }); });
[16:04:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Anyone have a @boot2gecko phone they'd be willing to donate to the jQuery Mobile project for testing? â˜… http://bit.ly/JIyBu7
[16:04:25] <walidvb> sanjayb: well it's in the css, but lemme try
[16:04:32] <walidvb> ThemNuts: I'm pretty sure you can like this
[16:04:41] <walidvb> but i know i've had trouble with this
[16:05:00] <walidvb> other wise try to set a var myClass = '.'+myclass or smth
[16:05:17] <ThemNuts> walidvb: i tried several things but non seem to work. If somebody could help me with this i could sleep with peace in mind :)
[16:05:39] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: to get the class from the input: var someclass = $('#inputid').val();
[16:05:44] <ThemNuts> thats the thing, i don't know the classname upfront, its dynamic
[16:06:07] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: then - $('.' + someclass).click(function() { alert("woohoo, go to sleep"); });
[16:06:26] <tobyg> where is it being made themnuts?
[16:06:29] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: but you know the input / wherever you're going to get the classname from, right ?
[16:06:33] <ThemNuts> by php on the spot
[16:06:55] <walidvb> php->javascript?
[16:07:03] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: lol - and is php putting it on the page somewhere, or are you going to have to make an ajax request to get it from php?
[16:07:26] <walidvb> sanjayb: if you load the 2nd page directly, try changing it's width(when it's still virgin)
[16:07:28] <ThemNuts> i have <input class="<?=$thisvar.$this2ndvar"> and want to use that class name to $("." + myVars).click( function()...
[16:07:38] <tmerrill99s> sanjayb, thank you, kind sir!
[16:09:05] <walidvb> ThemNuts: did you try printing myVars?
[16:09:35] <ThemNuts> i'll give it a try with what i have here
[16:09:47] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: think about it a bit and then come back to it :P - in the example you give, the only solution would be to either do a <?= php echo thing in your JS code as well
[16:09:53] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: but that's ugly as all hell.
[16:10:03] <walidvb> sanjayb: what?
[16:10:09] <sanjayb> ThemNuts: its a better idea to re-think this a wee bit.
[16:10:16] <walidvb> oh! in your js file??
[16:10:20] <walidvb> oh no
[16:10:22] <walidvb> haha
[16:10:24] <walidvb> in the header
[16:10:25] <sanjayb> walidvb: yes - oh no :-)
[16:10:27] <roo9> Hi, i'm using jquery mobile and wondering if anyone would have an idea how to right-align the toggle buttons on this page: http://adam.gs/jquery.html
[16:10:28] <walidvb> time to sleep, soon
[16:10:36] <walidvb> :D
[16:10:59] <wkmanire> Just use phpquery.
[16:11:11] <wkmanire> _$("#myDiv").dotheThings()
[16:11:22] <wkmanire> :D
[16:11:23] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, were you able to reproduce this problem?
[16:11:25] <walidvb> roo9: float:right
[16:11:34] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: which?
[16:11:44] <ThemNuts> echoing the php is not an option since its in a for loop, and as you say, its ugly as
[16:11:56] <sanjayb> $('.progress-container').css({'width': '30%'});
[16:12:10] <tocka> Could someone tell me whats wrong with this bit? http://pastebin.com/0DexL1fZ cant get it working..
[16:12:32] <ZLAPPER> walidvb: the one I just commented, about the misplacement of click/tap events on google maps/jquery mobile
[16:12:43] <sanjayb> walidvb: hm, your width problem is interesting.
[16:12:44] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: sry didn't see the link
[16:12:57] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, no problem: http://danielgarcia.co/trappt/mapa.php
[16:13:08] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: when you click on the icons?
[16:13:10] <wkmanire> tocka: For starters you probably want to use ceil or floor instead of round.
[16:13:16] <wkmanire> so that your height is more predictable.
[16:13:18] <sanjayb> er - i meant to type that $('.progress_container') into my chrome console and some-how it turned up in this chatroom. weird.
[16:13:36] <walidvb> haha
[16:13:47] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, yes, when I click on the markers but also on the zoom control
[16:14:09] <walidvb> i can't zoom
[16:14:15] <walidvb> by tapping
[16:14:23] <walidvb> but the markrs work fine
[16:14:49] <tocka> wkmanire still, that doesnt solve the problem :/
[16:14:53] <walidvb> and tapping above them doesn't work
[16:14:57] <walidvb> tocka: what problem?
[16:14:59] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, try to tap just below a marker and the zoom control
[16:15:18] <tocka> newHeight doesnt output anything
[16:15:18] <wkmanire> tocka: I couldn't address your problem because you didn't state one. "not working"
[16:15:35] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: no i have to tap right on it
[16:15:37] <ajpiano> ?doesn't work
[16:16:16] <sanjayb> walidvb: why are you setting .width() twice there ... ?
[16:16:24] <wkmanire> tocka: Make a jsfiddle please.
[16:16:32] <tocka> wkmanire here is a fiddle, i cant get the newHeight
[16:16:32] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/rFCgk/
[16:16:36] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Looks like it didn't work.
[16:16:41] <walidvb> isn't that what you said? i thought maybe if it had been set already..
[16:16:44] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, well, it works fine on chrome/windows and on a galaxy nexus
[16:16:59] <ajpiano> wkmanire: poor botty :(
[16:17:17] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, it doesn't work for me on a Motorola Defy
[16:17:47] <wkmanire> tocka: http://jsfiddle.net/rFCgk/1/
[16:17:54] <sanjayb> walidvb: oh no - i meant .css({'width': '0%'}).css({'width': $carboTotal+'%'}) .. but also, scratch that idea. just do .css({'width': $carboTotal+'%'}) once and that should work.
[16:17:55] <wkmanire> columnHeight isn't declared anywhere.
[16:18:04] <sanjayb> walidvb: this seems weird :/
[16:19:11] <walidvb> sanjayb: right? i tried with width(100%); and it does the same
[16:19:18] <wkmanire> tocka: Also you don't have an element by that ID defined in your markup
[16:19:19] <ajaxNoob> in jquery $.ajax is the error callback triggered if the returning json has a synatx error such as a:b:c instead of a:b, b:c
[16:19:22] <wkmanire> so it isn't going to find anything.
[16:19:23] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: i'm sorry i don't think i can help
[16:21:00] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, thanks anyway! just to be sure, did you say that you couldn't tap on the zoom control?
[16:21:14] <walidvb> what zoom control, actually?
[16:21:38] <sanjayb> walidvb: uh, have you tried .addClass() before .css({'width': ... }) ... ?
[16:21:48] <walidvb> i tried without addclass
[16:22:22] <sanjayb> walidvb: ok, here's my horrible ugly idea: http://dpaste.com/748719/
[16:22:33] <sanjayb> walidvb: wrap it in a setTimeout and see if it plays differently ..
[16:23:04] <walidvb> hm
[16:23:10] <walidvb> ..ok
[16:23:16] <walidvb> playin dirty
[16:23:21] <sanjayb> walidvb: sorry - really last resort kinda idea - lol, yea
[16:24:02] <Wass|> Is there a way to execute Javascript code in a page loaded with jquery?
[16:24:18] <sanjayb> ajaxNoob: good question. one good way to find out is to try :-)
[16:24:49] <sanjayb> Wass|: what do you mean? jquery IS javascript? you can still execute any normal javascript you wish even if you have jquery included on the page.
[16:25:12] <sanjayb> Wass|: ah no, wait, i see what you mean
[16:25:19] <ajaxNoob> hehe.. i'm sorry.. sanjayb.. you are correct.. I had nested ajax calls and placed error callback in wrong place.. it is working now thanks
[16:26:07] <walidvb> sanjayb: i need the quote, no?
[16:26:08] <walidvb> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[16:26:19] <ajaxNoob> so yes, error event is triggerd and error callback is being called.  but I want to output the json for debugging purposes instead of debugging response in firebug.
[16:26:22] <sanjayb> Wass|: you wont get a $(document).ready() event on the page you are loading via ajax
[16:26:34] <walidvb> th ejs is already loaded
[16:26:42] <sanjayb> Wass|: but if you put the JS to be executed at the bottom of the page you are fetching via ajax
[16:26:44] <ajaxNoob> the json response is an object, not a string.. is there a method to go backwarrds from object to string instead of string to json object
[16:26:45] <walidvb> sanjayb: oh sorry
[16:26:49] <sanjayb> Wass|: then the browser should execute it.
[16:27:24] <walidvb> Wass|: you mean within a page, or on a page?
[16:28:01] <sanjayb> ajaxNoob: JSON.stringify(object)
[16:28:16] <Wass|> walidvb : the javascript is inside the page to be loaded with jquery
[16:28:34] <walidvb> yeah i guess sanjayb's method would work
[16:28:41] <walidvb> can't see any other way right now
[16:28:55] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, this (the default) zoom control: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fefsxejty78jppn/screenshot-1337124238749.png
[16:29:18] <walidvb> sanjayb: did you see anything? with quotes it gave me a $carboTotal not defined
[16:29:26] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: not there
[16:29:46] <walidvb> $carboProgress, sry
[16:29:56] <ZLAPPER> walidvb, could you send me a screenshot? sorry to bother you :)
[16:30:54] <amaroks1> Hello guys
[16:31:19] <walidvb> ZLAPPER: exactly like you, but without controls
[16:31:55] <sanjayb> walidvb: you don't want the quotes around "function ... "
[16:32:28] <walidvb> sanjayb: but if you put inline code you must?
[16:33:33] <sanjayb> walidvb: its not inline code, its an anonymous function
[16:34:04] <walidvb> ok, it did work once
[16:35:32] <shoky> raj: $someplace.find('.someclass').filter( function() { return this.innerText == 'sometext'; } ).length || $('<span>', {'class': 'someclass', text: 'sometext'}).appendTo($someplace)
[16:35:57] <ThemNuts> i almost found it, just one thing i can't get to do dynamically: http://pastebin.com/bD40kJYb the 'doel' var registers and is doing what its supposed to but as soon as i put it in place of [name=myPhpVar] it goes wrong
[16:36:04] <walidvb> sanjayb: with 3 seconds it works ^^
[16:36:13] <sanjayb> walidvb: roflmao :-)
[16:36:45] <ajaxNoob> JSON.stringify thank you very much sanjayb
[16:36:53] <sanjayb> walidvb: this is probably some intricate FUBAR with jquery mobile + css transitions, something ... my guess is you need to wait for the page transition to finish before applying this ... for some reason ...
[16:38:04] <walidvb> ThemNuts: it goes wrong first line?
[16:38:08] <walidvb> sanjayb: hm that sucks.
[16:38:10] <walidvb> hahahaha
[16:38:23] <walidvb> no it's ok, well i guess that's how it'll have to be!
[16:38:40] <sanjayb> walidvb: well.. you can probably some-how do this in the callback of the next page being loaded
[16:38:57] <walidvb> via jqm?
[16:38:59] <sanjayb> so you're not guessing a setTimeout value, which seems quite dangerous
[16:39:05] <walidvb> i'll check the api
[16:39:12] <walidvb> sanjayb: why is that dangerous, though?
[16:39:17] <sanjayb> walidvb: something like that .. they should have an event for it ..
[16:39:36] <sanjayb> walidvb: well, if you're "guessing" that value, and suppose that time is different on different devices / browsers, etc...
[16:39:50] <walidvb> sanjayb: quite true
[16:39:57] <ThemNuts> yeah, instead of needing to write the var there, i need it to fetch it from the input that is clicked and put it in there dynamiclly
[16:40:16] <ThemNuts> like it does on line 4
[16:41:12] <walidvb> http://pastebin.com/4FqRAVn1
[16:41:19] <walidvb> why don't you simply do that?
[16:42:09] <walidvb> or http://pastebin.com/sn5iGRn3
[16:42:48] <ThemNuts> right
[16:42:50] <ThemNuts> lets try
[16:44:48] <walidvb> sanjayb: hm http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/api/events.html
[16:45:07] <walidvb> check page load. to what do i need to attach that?
[16:45:14] <walidvb> window, act, i guess.?
[16:46:07] <sanjayb> walidvb: lol, yea, good question.
[16:46:59] <walidvb> yep, window
[16:47:29] <sanjayb> walidvb: yea, or $(document) , not sure if there's really a difference
[16:49:00] <imsky> there's no difference
[16:49:11] <imsky> in fact if you do window == document, you'll get true
[16:50:29] <walidvb> imsky: nice to know
[16:51:17] <sanjayb> imsky: i get false on console when i do window == document
[16:51:23] <imsky> good good
[16:56:24] <hacks> is there a way to have a callback inkoved when a new element with a specific selector is appended to the dom?
[16:56:27] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys, I would like to break down a select expression in two.  What is the best way of doing this.  Say, $(".select_elem option:selected") into something like: $(".select").$("option:selected")
[16:56:32] <_pr0t0type_> is this possible?
[16:58:25] <sanjayb> _pr0t0type_, $('.select_elem').find('option:selected') i think is what you're looking for.
[16:59:00] <sanjayb> hacks: dont think so - not without polling the DOM .. but what's your use case exactly? can it be fulfilled with .live() or so?
[16:59:45] <hacks> sanjayb: I have a bit of code that goes through all .thumbnails on the page and resizes/crops them.
[17:00:06] <_pr0t0type_> sanjayb: thanks, I will try to see if that solves it
[17:00:33] <hacks> sanjayb: Whenever I append new .thumbnails dynamically to the DOM, these code doesn't effect these new element, obviously.
[17:00:38] <walidvb> hacks: and you don't want to go through again each time
[17:00:46] <hacks> Right
[17:00:48] <sanjayb> hacks: hm .. i think you'd have to check at all places where you're adding content to the DOM ...
[17:01:24] <walidvb> maybe addClass('processed') and then $('img:not(processed)')
[17:01:40] <walidvb> still checks everywhere, but runs your code once
[17:02:13] <hacks> Too bad there wasn't a mechinism built into append/prepend that allows me to fire an event when an element with a specific selector was appended to the DOM.
[17:02:47] <sanjayb> hacks: since its 5:30 am where I am, here's a really ugly approach to the problem: http://dpaste.com/748733/
[17:02:49] <walidvb> hack the core, hacks ;)
[17:03:47] <hacks> walidvb: could work, but then it's subject to a minor delay where users will see the larger images.
[17:04:02] <walidvb> hacks: why so?
[17:04:10] <walidvb> because of the addClass??
[17:04:13] <sanjayb> hacks: OR, really, the best way is to do something like call a function whenever you inject content to the DOM, or maybe a bit cleaner fire a custom event or so
[17:04:26] <hacks> Because it's on an interval of 250 ms
[17:04:54] <walidvb> hacks: that was sanjayb's suggestion
[17:04:55] <sanjayb> hacks: yes. and if you reduce that interval too much i imagine the function would get really expensive (it seems like the WRONG way to do it)
[17:05:04] <walidvb> and i disagreen completely
[17:05:05] <walidvb> haha
[17:05:09] <hacks> that's what I meant, sorry. :P
[17:05:32] <walidvb> what triggers the new thumbs?
[17:05:55] <sanjayb> hacks: i just dont know of any to fulfil your use-case. the correct solution, imo, is to call a function or so everywhere new thumbs maybe triggered.
[17:06:34] <walidvb> imo too :)
[17:07:10] <Foxhoundz> is there any way to trigger a hover event over an element with z-index rule on it?
[17:07:17] <Foxhoundz> it's being covered by another element so the event is not firing
[17:07:17] <sanjayb> hacks: hey - maybe there is a solution: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3840149/jquery-live-event-for-added-dom-elements
[17:07:25] <Foxhoundz> or perhaps, is there a workaround?
[17:08:25] <hacks> sanjayb: how expensive is livequery?
[17:08:35] <sanjayb> hacks: no idea :-)
[17:08:43] <hacks> hmm
[17:08:44] <walidvb> i was asking myself the same thing
[17:08:44] <sanjayb> hacks: only one way to find out? :-)
[17:09:39] <sanjayb> Foxhoundz: i think the css4 cursor:none; property aims to fulfil this use-case or so, but no implementation yet - for now, i think you have to attach .hover() to the element that's on top of the z-index pile ..
[17:11:39] <snover> Foxhoundz: thereâ€™s no fully cross-browser way to do that. There is a pointer-events property that some browsers support.
[17:11:55] * sanjayb looks up pointer-events
[17:13:00] <sanjayb> snover: hm, i thought there was some implementation already for cursor:none; which I thought did the same thing, but maybe im totally mistaken.
[17:14:08] <shoky> Foxhoundz: there's also this http://e-infotainment.com/projects/interface-query/demos/behaviours/forward-mouse-events/
[17:14:13] <ryanneufeld> snover++
[17:14:59] <hacks> Livequery hasn't been commit in about 2 years. :\
[17:15:30] <Foxhoundz> shoky: thanks!
[17:15:48] <Wass|> <sanjayb> Wass|: but if you put the JS to be executed at the bottom of the page you are fetching via ajax  then the browser should execute it.
[17:15:56] <Wass|> I just did, it's not executing it
[17:16:19] <hope> hello there i want to ask you about making your own jquery plugin?
[17:16:34] <sanjayb> Wass|: do you have a code example up somewhere? i know for sure this works, in general.
[17:17:13] <shoky> hope: go ahead
[17:17:13] <Wass|> sanjayb : here's the page I want to fetch with ajax : http://www.wmsolinc.com/test.php
[17:17:53] <Wass|> the page loads fine but i loose the ability to  sort/filtre the table
[17:18:37] <sanjayb> Wass|: so, you need all the javascript at the BOTTOM of the page, as I said, before the </body> tag
[17:18:58] <sanjayb> Wass|: and ideally the content you're fetching via ajax should not be a full page like this but just the html snippet.
[17:19:22] <hope> shoky: thanks , i have a list with the same class but have different id and when i click the class i want to get its id but the problem the first id of the list will show
[17:19:35] <shoky> huh.
[17:19:58] <shoky> commas would be nice
[17:20:31] <hope> shoky: what about comma ?
[17:20:35] <sanjayb> hope: $('.fooclass').click(function() { var id = $(this).attr("id"); });  but yes, some commas would be nice.
[17:20:39] <imsky> shoky you card
[17:20:52] <shoky> i couldnt figure it out sry ; (
[17:20:59] <shoky> sanjay could ; )
[17:21:02] <shoky> and he also has a cool name
[17:21:04] <imsky> raacist

[17:21:11] <shoky> so............... yea
[17:21:14] <imsky> lol
[17:23:06] <Mowee_> Hey guys, I created a form where after entering something into an input field a new input field appears. Works fine for the first time and then itâ€™s not working properly anymore. I donâ€™t understand why. Can somebody help me? http://jsfiddle.net/LkbrV/
[17:23:31] <Wass|> sanjayb : what If the page that fetch the subpage is already in a  <body> tag ?
[17:24:51] <shoky> Mowee_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/LkbrV/1/
[17:24:53] <sanjayb> Wass|: yes, ideally the subpage should have no body tag
[17:24:55] <hope> sanjayb: thanks, that is what ive done but the id that will appear is the id of the first list. because the list have same class
[17:25:10] <sanjayb> Wass|: just the html snippet - and all the <link> and <script> tags at the bottom
[17:26:22] <sanjayb> ok, now i've lost hope. good night all.
[17:26:28] <imsky> GOOD NIGHT
[17:26:28] <Mowee_> shoky: Thank you :)
[17:26:43] <Wass|> alriught good night thanks for the tips
[17:27:03] <shoky> np
[17:27:14] <shoky> Mowee_: you need to delegate the event to a container element, using .on()
[17:27:48] <shoky> because that element is already in the DOM when you bind the 'change' event
[17:29:00] <Mowee_> ah ok, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining :)
[17:29:31] <shoky> np
[17:35:53] <mick`> Hi, got some problem to open a modal window (jqmodal), i made this function: http://jsfiddle.net/RjWVu/
[17:36:23] <mick`> when die results are loaded and the link is set it loads the whole destination-page but not the modal window
[17:36:40] <mick`> when i set the link to the main script it is loading

[17:41:09] <tocka> One part of my code works only by using  $(document).ready and another part works only by  $(document).load, is there a way to merge them somehow?

[18:01:56] <djcercone> anybody have experience with the .focus() method and Internet Explorer?
[18:09:52] <nDuff> I'm getting the error "$(this) is null" when running $('form#relgroup-form input').each(function(idx){$(this).text="";}) -- but the jQuery docs appear to be explicit that $(this) should be set when the callbacks to each are run. Are there gotchas here I don't know about?
[18:15:23] <Axsuul> Is there any way to force a an element's css to redraw
[18:17:09] <shoky> Axsuul: changing it usually does the trick
[18:17:46] <shoky> nDuff: $(this).text('')
[18:18:12] <shoky> actually if they are inputs then maybe you mean $(this).val('')

[18:37:18] <ansdev1> can i select all elements that may be loaded dynamically?
[18:37:34] <ansdev1> i know .live() but that needs an event
[18:40:27] <Dr-Bombay> are you writing the code that loads them?
[18:42:52] <Dr-Bombay> you cannot select elements that do not exist in the DOM yet
[18:43:21] <Dr-Bombay> "Pray Mr. Babbage, if you put in the wrong numbers, will the right answers come out?"
[18:43:58] <p3rsist> Hi guys. is there a way to bind a change handler to a live select element? I tried the new 1.7 on() function... and I also tried the old deprecated live() function, but none work.
[18:46:05] <ansdev1> Dr-Bombay: i'm using a jtemplate to copy them into an existing element and then swapping a class on the copied elements
[18:46:27] <ansdev1> i wish to select all the ones before they exist in the DOM.. there's no way to achieve this?
[18:46:53] <ansdev1> i've already got the script working by select the new element each time this gubbins happens but i thought there may be a nicer solution
[18:52:41] <shippy> hey there.. can someone help troubleshoot this?  http://pastebin.com/8AcJZp3x

[18:57:01] <sqwishy> When I handle a click event, I want to call something after the element actually receives the event (in my case, after the location hash changes). How do I do this with a handler bound to the click event in jquery?
[19:24:20] <dougb> is it possible to scan through elements that were appended? i'm trying to run $.each on an element, but it doesn't find any of the newly added elements that were appended to the page
[19:24:38] <k1ng> can anyone recommend me a datepicker that allow to pick AM/PM?
[19:33:50] <nezZario> lol
[19:33:56] <nezZario> ever noticed the pastebin is powered by mootools?
[19:44:18] <Mowee_> I would like to go through all input fields except the last one. This is not working. Any ideas? input[type=text]:not(:last-child)
[19:45:40] <ColKurtz> Mowee_ :last-child specifically targets input elements that are the  last children of their containers
[19:46:01] <ColKurtz> if there's a <p> element afterwards, for example, then it's no longer a last-child
[19:46:05] <ColKurtz> what you're looking for is :last
[19:46:42] <ColKurtz> which would be the last element in the array matching that selector.
[19:48:27] <Mowee_> ah damn, and I was going through it over and over looking for the error
[19:48:29] <Mowee_> thanks :)
[19:51:01] <ColKurtz> np Mowee_ :)
[20:05:01] <wkmanire> When the night, has come... and my brain is dead, and the monitor sheds the only light I see. I can't code. I can't code. Noooo iiiii can't code one line. But some beer, would be, just fine.

[20:08:33] <k1ng> i am upside down
[20:09:37] <raj> is there any jquery plugin like this that allows live highlighting? http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html
[20:23:26] <wkmanire> k1ng: are you?
[20:23:32] <wkmanire> What's your lat and long?
[20:24:03] <k1ng> 23.8511° N, 89.9250° E
[20:25:04] <wkmanire> k1ng: Yeah, you're upside down
[20:26:04] <k1ng> now answer my question
[20:26:35] <wkmanire> k1ng: I didn't see it. can you paste it again? Sorry
[20:26:44] <k1ng> can anyone recommend me a datepicker that allow to pick AM/PM?
[20:29:16] <wkmanire> k1ng: No, I can't recommend one off the top of my head.
[20:29:24] <wkmanire> I have had pretty bad luck with datetime pickers.
[20:29:30] <shippy_> is this valid jquery? http://pastebin.com/SfsapMcj
[20:29:48] <wkmanire> shippy_: Looks good to me
[20:30:27] <k1ng> wkmanire, same here
[20:30:28] <k1ng> :(
[20:30:49] <k1ng> shippy_, did it work?
[20:31:10] <shippy_> it doesn't, but i do see why it isn't.. the element i'm attempting to find isn't a child
[20:31:16] <shippy_> of where that line of code is
[20:31:16] <k1ng> wkmanire, actually it does not work
[20:31:22] <k1ng> valid* i mean
[20:31:40] <k1ng> shippy_, show us the code
[20:31:42] <k1ng> page
[20:32:17] <shippy_> http://pastebin.com/eLe88Rn6
[20:32:19] <shippy_> here it is
[20:32:30] <shippy_> has some php in there, to echo out the html
[20:32:33] <shippy_> before applying the jquery
[20:32:33] <k1ng> stop using pastebin
[20:32:58] <k1ng> id="goal_thumb_overlay" < bad bad bad
[20:33:11] <k1ng> you cant have same id for mutiple tag
[20:33:25] <k1ng> shippy_, use class="goal_thumb_overlay"
[20:33:43] <someprimetime> is there a known issue with clone() on like > 50 elements?
[20:34:16] <shippy_> got it
[20:34:19] <shippy_> works, thanks k1ng
[20:34:47] <k1ng> np
[20:42:52] <jaapbadlands> how do I check if any animations are currently running
[20:44:41] <someprimetime> @jaapbadlands  if ($('#div').is(':animated'))
[20:46:11] <raj> any plugin that can change the css of highlighted text?
[20:47:01] <Cork> raj: no
[20:47:09] <Cork> theres some css selectors though
[20:47:25] <Cork> ::selection and :-moz-selection
[20:48:07] <raj> Cork, but I want the selected area to stay highlighted even after the browser highlight is removed
[20:48:23] <Cork> ah
[20:48:31] <Cork> you want a selection replacement plugin
[20:48:39] <Cork> not exactly what you asked :)
[20:49:10] <raj> hmm
[20:49:14] <raj> perhaps
[20:49:15] <raj> yes
[20:49:27] <raj> maybe that's why my google results haven't gotten me anywhere =T
[20:50:25] <Cork> raj: you could prob do something with http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html
[20:50:58] <raj> yeah, i saw that, but I have no idea what to do with it
[20:51:08] <raj> that's why I was hoping there was a jquery implementation
[20:51:29] <Cork> you would have to track the selecton events your self
[20:51:46] <raj> hmm
[20:51:49] <Cork> and then you could use that to do the actual highlighting
[20:52:02] <raj> i'm not sure what that entails, really
[20:52:16] <Cork> loads of work :)
[20:52:41] <Cork> its not simple to replace user interaction features in browsers
[20:54:45] <raj> hmm
[20:54:58] <raj> i can't believe no one has made a plugin/script for this
[20:55:14] <raj> seems like a common use scenario
[20:55:20] <Cork> no
[20:55:27] <raj> k :)
[20:55:29] <Cork> it sounds like something rarly needed
[20:55:36] <Cork> highlighting is another matter
[20:55:42] <Cork> and there is a plugin for that
[20:55:53] <raj> so I basically need to detect what was selected?
[20:56:09] <raj> like, what currently has the browser highlight
[20:56:10] <dfdsfds> Hello room
[20:56:57] <Cork> raj: you need to track the caret and update the range it should result in
[20:58:04] <Cork> and thats differing degrees of hard in browsers
[20:58:18] <raj> hmm
[20:58:26] <raj> so save it for a rainy day?
[20:58:33] <raj> and get some real work done?
[20:58:39] <Cork> save it for a rainy week or two
[20:58:44] <raj> whatttt????
[20:58:45] <raj> omg
[20:59:02] <raj> ok, what should i be googling for to see if anything even remotely similar exists?
[20:59:40] <Cork> javascript get caret position
[21:00:25] <Cork> raj: the reason its so hard is that browsers are REALLY protective of the information about what the user selects
[21:00:30] <Cork> its copy buffer and so on
[21:00:33] <raj> i'm trying to highlight within a div or <p>, not in a textarea
[21:00:49] <Cork> there should be some pages about that too
[21:01:05] <raj> k, but not for caret position, right?
[21:01:29] <Cork> well caret or user selection
[21:01:56] <Cork> if the one describing it know what they talk about thats what they'r going to call it
[21:02:30] <raj> k, this looks a bit daunting...looks like I'll wait till monsoon season
[21:02:40] <Cork> :)
[21:02:51] <raj> thanks for the 411 though Cork :)
[21:02:59] <Cork> i once tried to make a cross browser "copy to buffer"
[21:03:01] <raj> oh, that's Information in US :)
[21:03:12] <Cork> and found it almost impossible to do cross browser
[21:03:17] <raj> copy text?
[21:03:18] <Cork> and ended up using flash
[21:03:37] <raj> isn't copy/paste OS-relatecd?
[21:03:44] <Cork> ya, on click on a button i wanted to copy a specific part of the page to the copy buffer
[21:03:54] <Cork> raj: sure
[21:04:10] <Cork> there was ways to do it back in the 90's
[21:04:22] <Cork> but it was abused heavily so it was blocked
[21:04:54] <Cork> they've reimplemented it again in some parts with better security
[21:05:07] <raj> really??
[21:05:10] <raj> i'm surprised you can't do that
[21:05:19] <Cork> but its still really limited when you want to fiddle with what the user does with selections and copy buffer
[21:05:44] <raj> thenewyorker.com adds their citation at the end of whatever you copy
[21:05:51] <Cork> for years you just couldn't do anything with it if it wasn't in a form field
[21:07:13] <Cork> raj: doens't work in all browsers, and ya its the copy event listner thats recently been added
[21:08:01] <raj> http://lifehacker.com/5553814/stop-sites-from-adding-citations-to-copy-and-paste-blocks
[21:08:14] <raj> it shows how the newyorker.com is able to do so
[21:08:29] <raj> interesting stuff
[21:08:53] <Cork> ugg i HATE sites that demands js just to render the text
[21:10:09] <raj> why would a site do that?
[21:10:23] <Cork> advertisement
[21:10:46] <raj> render the page's regular text though?
[21:10:54] <Cork> ah, that
[21:11:02] <Cork> bad design
[21:11:17] <Cork> many load the content through js
[21:11:25] <Cork> some show it through js
[21:11:39] <Cork> sometimes its to force the user to enable js for the site
[21:12:12] <raj> aah, i see
[21:12:40] <Cork> i often just deam them idiots and find a better place for my info
[21:21:25] <raj> Cork, that's a good policy
[21:21:48] <raj> i think you need to start a movement :) power in #s
[21:22:17] <dr0id> ...
[21:23:56] <tga> hello
[21:24:32] <tga> quick question, when I pass any kind of async callback inside an object constructor, how can I access my current object?
[21:24:41] <tga> 'this' gets reassigned to #document
[21:26:05] <Cork> tga: callback.call(this)
[21:26:31] <tga> I'm not calling the callback directly
[21:26:37] <tga> things like .done() for example
[21:26:58] <tga> actually done() and fail() are the bulk of it, all deffered stuff
[21:27:02] <tga> deferred rather
[21:27:28] <Cork> your using deffered or ajax?
[21:27:35] <Cork> *deferred
[21:27:43] <tga> ajax is using deferred
[21:27:48] <tga> so yeah, only deferred
[21:28:01] <tga> a bunch of my own too
[21:28:06] <Cork> ok, let me refrace that
[21:28:17] <Cork> your doing your own deferred or ajax?
[21:28:22] <tga> both
[21:28:33] <tga> and using the deferred interface when doing ajax
[21:28:39] <Cork> sigh
[21:28:51] <Cork> ok, lets go the long way
[21:28:53] <tga> I need a way to pass in 'this' to done() and fail() callbacks
[21:29:05] <Cork> if your doing ajax, you can set a scope that will be the this in the callbacks
[21:29:14] <Cork> if your doing deferred you need to do that your self
[21:29:18] <tga> right, it doesn't help with my own deferreds
[21:29:45] <tga> is there no way to do it without passing in a context param to each deferred?
[21:30:19] <tga> and then inside the deferred to each callback
[21:31:00] <Cork> resolveWith takes this
[21:31:05] <Cork> and its where you set it
[21:31:08] <nezZario> vaginals
[21:31:33] <Cork> tga: well and rejectWith
[21:31:41] <tga> resolveWith is the same as calling resolve(context) and then doing this = context inside the callback
[21:31:49] <tga> right?
[21:31:55] <Cork> no
[21:32:07] <Cork> well kinda
[21:32:33] <Cork> fireWith, resolveWith and rejectWith is the same as calling call or apply
[21:32:46] <Cork> * as calling a function with
[21:32:57] <tga> not a big difference from passing in context manualy
[21:33:00] <tga> *manually
[21:33:16] <tga> but ok, if that's the standard way
[21:33:18] <Cork> well you don't have to specify a variable in the function, but ya
[21:33:21] <Cork> thats how this works
[21:33:35] <tga> I'll get busy changing my deferreds
[21:34:23] <tga> I guess I could also do it the ajax() way and pass in a context parameter
[21:34:33] <tga> it would be a bit clearer what is what
[21:34:39] <Cork> tga: context becomes this in ajax
[21:34:51] <tga> right
[21:35:12] <tga> so essentially all my resolve()
[21:35:17] <tga> become resolveWith(this)
[21:35:22] <Cork> right
[21:35:34] <tga> not too bad
[21:35:51] <tga> I thought I needed to pass this to my deferred constructors too, but they're already in the object
[21:35:58] <tga> cool, thanks again Cork
[21:36:03] <Cork> np
[21:48:01] <phxheat> if anyone is willing to take on a small script that carousels a long div bg image continuously and loops it as well, please PM me so we can discuss it and your rate. its kinda urgent :)
[22:13:19] <ansdev1> my jcrop onSelect event doesn't see the dynamically loaded elements in IE7... even though jCrop is working for them
[22:31:35] <Xtrivity> hey guys, If you have a element $(".test"+i).append("<div class=\"test2"+i"\"); can you append something into test2+i as it's been created on the fly?
[22:31:40] <Xtrivity> in the same for loop
[22:32:20] <Cork> $(".test"+i).append($("<div class=\"test2"+i"\").append('<span/>'));
[22:32:28] <Cork> uh...
[22:32:32] <Cork> that html isn't valid
[22:33:00] <Cork> $(".test"+i).append($("<div class=\"test2"+i"\"/>").append('<span/>'));
[22:33:02] <Xtrivity> yeah, sorry but assuming it is valid
[22:33:42] <tw2113> Cork are you holding fort?
[22:33:47] <Cork> or var test2 = $("<div class=\"test2"+i"\"/>"); test2.append('<span/>'); $(".test"+i).append(test2);
[22:33:57] <Cork> tw2113: not really
[22:34:16] <tw2113> for shame! on your house!
[22:35:17] <Xtrivity> thanks Cork
[22:38:16] <nir0> hello, i got a selector here: $('a[data-remote]') how can i modify it to exclude links with data-history parameters?
[22:41:20] <Jerry> is there a jq function I can use to encode a javascript array and insert it as the value of a hidden input, that will make that array readable by php when sent via post?
[22:42:59] <nir0> Jerry: store such things in session maybe?
[22:43:20] <Jerry> nir0: nah, this array is generated on the client side.
[22:43:37] <nir0> Jerry: i see...
[22:43:42] <Jerry> essentially, an array of tags for a bunch of images
[22:44:00] <Jerry> I don't want 30 checkbox inputs showing up for each image(up to 100)
[22:44:04] <nir0> why not send it as they are?
[22:44:54] <jaapbadlands> you want to convert an array to a json string
[22:44:56] <Jerry> well, the way the tag system is set up right now is to have one set of checkboxes with the tags, and each time the user selects an image for editing, the tag dialog pops up. selected tags are then stored in an array to be sent over later
[22:45:15] <Jerry> jaapbadlands: ohhhh, and then json_decode it on the other end
[22:45:31] <Jerry> thanks, didn't occur to me!
[22:52:11] <mgl> hi guys
[22:54:17] <mgl> $('#weatherbox').load("weather_main.php") how to stop this loading process if specified time past
[22:54:19] <TylerWhitney> why is .hide() not working for a text input?
[22:56:08] <Jerry> mgl: I think this is what you're looking for: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1540986
[22:56:20] <Jerry> you can set a timeout param on the ajax call
[22:57:15] <Talon_> how do you test if a jquery object is already a child of another jquery object? I'm trying to use jquery-ui to utilize draggable and droppable, upon drop, if it's not a child, I want to append the dropped item to the container, pretty easy so far, but now the issue is making sure it's not already a child if you drag it again, since the position needs to be fixed only when it's appended, and
[22:57:15] <Talon_> not afterwards.
[22:59:41] <dfrey> I'm new to jquery and javascript in general and I'm trying to cobble something together quickly.  I'm trying to call getJSON() to grab data from a node.js backend.  I get the data back, but when I do: $.each(data, function(k, v) { $('#test').append(k + ': ' + v + '<br/>'); } ); I get a bunch of lines that are like "17: d".  It seems like the json data is being treated as an array of characters whereas I was
[22:59:43] <dfrey> expecting the keys to be from my JSON data eg "stdout" and "stderr".  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong.
[23:01:15] <mgl> $('#weatherbox').load("weather_main.php") how to stop this loading process if specified time past
[23:01:25] <Jerry> dfrey: have you checked that you're getting an actual json string with the request? with say, firebug?
[23:03:36] <Talon_> http://jsfiddle.net/VfBdT/ <== here is what i'm trying to do in a short to the point example
[23:05:49] <blyrrh> Not specifically jQuery, but I saw this line of code in a microsoft template and it looks like an order of operations nightmare.
[23:05:51] <blyrrh> var item = options && options.item ? options.item : data.items.getAt(0);
[23:06:19] <blyrrh> i'm guessing (options && options.item)
[23:06:37] <raj> can I ensure that :hover is not occuring on click?
[23:06:51] <raj> that the css for :hover is not implemented, essentially
[23:10:45] <Cork> raj: no, hover happens BEFORE click
[23:11:34] <raj> ya, but after the click, it's not fully apparent that the item is unclicked, cuz hover has the same styling as a clicked item
[23:11:37] <raj> ...if that makes sense
[23:12:45] <d[^_^]b> Any reason why this would still be submitting? $("#Login").on("click",function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); (Its live content added via Ajax call)
[23:13:25] <Cork> d[^_^]b: thats not a live listner
[23:13:29] <Cork> its the same as bind
[23:13:47] <d[^_^]b> As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live().
[23:13:51] <Cork> $(parent).on("click", "#Login",function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); is the live listner
[23:13:59] <d[^_^]b> Oh
[23:14:04] <raj> k, I just did this
[23:14:04] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/436629/how-do-i-remove-hover
[23:15:01] <d[^_^]b> $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);     <-- slaps his ball bag.
[23:17:26] <Talon_> hmm, seems it was an error in my lib, I typo
[23:18:33] <Talon_> 'd and chose 1.5 over 1.7 lol, soon as I fixed it it fixed my problem, checked mozillas webconsole and was getting a c.replace error in jquery.min.js.. so everything I tried in an attempt was actually that old libs fault lol
[23:19:04] <TylerWhitney> I can't get .change to fire on a radio input
[23:19:11] <TylerWhitney> or live/on change either
[23:19:12] <TylerWhitney> or bind
[23:20:42] <TylerWhitney> oops, nvm, not in .ready made a bracket mistake
[23:23:59] <ARUN__> how to detect browsers with jquery ?
[23:24:57] <raj> i added $myelement.data('elementdata', elementobjectdata)
[23:25:12] <raj> not I want to add an additional key/value
[23:25:17] <raj> *now i want to
[23:25:34] <raj> elementobjectdata['addedkey'] = 'addedvalue'
[23:25:49] <raj> but how can I do that directly to the .data('elementdata')
[23:25:50] <raj> ?
[23:26:23] <raj> do i HAVE to modify elementobjectdata and then put the whole thing into 'elementdata' again?
[23:27:21] <Jerry> raj: yup, you have to access the actual element's data property
[23:27:31] <Jerry> otherwise you're just changing the var
[23:27:43] <raj> so can i add a single key/value to it?
[23:27:46] <ARUN__> if anybody has experience with jqueryui dialog box : can you please tell me when we set height option for dialog box, why gecko browser have height always height+1 and not equal to height ?
[23:28:27] <Jerry> raj: you either have to update elementobjectdata, then set $myelement.data('elementdata', elementobjectdata), OR add a new key, like $myelement.data('NEWelementdata', NEWelementobjectdata)
[23:28:41] <raj> ok
[23:28:42] <raj> gotcha
[23:28:43] <raj> thank you
[23:29:11] <varnie> Hello.
[23:29:43] <ARUN__> if anybody has experience with jqueryui dialog box : can you please tell me when we set height option for dialog box, why gecko browser have height always height+1 and not equal to height ?
[23:29:51] <ARUN__> is ther anybody who have come across this problem ?
[23:30:04] <ARUN__> or is it some bug of jquery ui ?
[23:32:23] <dfrey> Jerry: I'll give firebug a whirl and see if that provides some hints.  Thanks for the suggestion.
[23:43:21] <soee> hi, how can i do some actions on element when user click on it or page is loaded? Do i have to split it to 2 separate codes or maybe i can do such thing in with combinaton .click + something ?
[23:45:58] <Dr-Bombay> soee: define a named function and register it as a handler for both events, separately
[23:56:17] <skylamer`> Use "on"
[23:56:41] <Zhy> a jQuery-UI dialogue , whether modal or not, does always remove the ui-state-active that I lay over the table row that's been clicked.. how could I prevent this?
