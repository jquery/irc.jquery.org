[00:00:06] <Cork> the 'key'
[00:00:21] <symfonius> ah oky
[00:00:23] <symfonius> *okay
[00:00:38] <symfonius> that bit needs to be dynamic
[00:00:51] <symfonius> so I imagine if I used a var there it wouldn't be in scope
[00:01:01] <symfonius> arr.filter(function(elm, keyword) { return keyword in elm })
[00:01:04] <Cork> js> var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 },{ a:3 }]; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filrer(function(elm) { return 'a' in elm; }));
[00:01:04] <symfonius> would that work?
[00:01:07] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[00:01:12] <Cork> sigh
[00:01:39] <Cork> js> var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 },{ a:3 }]; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filter(function(elm) { return 'a' in elm; })));
[00:01:39] <tech-ninja> can you actually pass returns this way, or is this just figurative?
[00:01:41] <b-ot> Cork: [{"a":1},{"a":3}]
[00:02:37] <symfonius> js> var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 },{ a:3 }]; var keyword = 'a'; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filter(function(elm, keyword) { return keyword in elm; })));
[00:02:40] <b-ot> symfonius: []
[00:02:53] <Cork> you're overwriting keyword
[00:03:04] <Cork> js> var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 },{ a:3 }]; var keyword = 'a'; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filter(function(elm) { return keyword in elm; })));
[00:03:05] <symfonius> js> var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 },{ a:3 }]; var keyword = 'a'; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filter(function(elm) { return keyword in elm; })));
[00:03:08] <b-ot> Cork: [{"a":1},{"a":3}]
[00:03:13] <b-ot> symfonius: [{"a":1},{"a":3}]
[00:03:16] <symfonius> ah ok
[00:03:22] <symfonius> I thought keyword wouldn't be in scope
[00:03:26] <symfonius> because of the function call
[00:03:43] <Cork> symfonius: inline function declaration inherit the scop
[00:03:44] <Cork> +e
[00:03:53] <symfonius> ok
[00:04:04] <symfonius> I'm still in a php mindset
[00:04:15] <tech-ninja> so return keyword in elem is == to for (keyword in elem) return keyword; ???
[00:07:32] <tech-ninja> @Cork ?
[00:07:57] <symfonius> Cork: in that example, assuming there is only one matching item - how would I get the value?
[00:07:58] <Cork> tech-ninja: no filter expects true/false return
[00:08:08] <symfonius> say this was the obk: {"a": 1}
[00:08:09] <symfonius> obj
[00:08:11] <Cork> where true == keep; false == drop
[00:08:42] <Cork> js> var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 }]; var keyword = 'a'; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filter(function(elm) { return keyword in elm; })[0][keyword]));
[00:08:46] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[00:08:58] <symfonius> thanks
[00:09:40] <Cork> tech-ninja: .filter works the same as $.grep

[00:10:27] <jquery811> I have an issue with jquery UI dialog box.. http://hastebin.com/nukihoxuqu.coffee
[00:11:00] <jquery811> Trying to have a dialog box open when I click to edit a comment, that works fine. But when I go to edit another comment, it edits the previous comment as well as the current one? Any ideas why?
[00:11:32] <symfonius> Cork: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '1' in item_number
[00:11:52] <Cork> item_number??
[00:11:52] <Verzlo> Anyone?
[00:12:03] <tech-ninja> hmm.. interesting
[00:12:07] <Cork> Verzlo: $(function() { inside a function is a strong indication you're missing something
[00:12:25] <Cork> Verzlo: also please make a live example
[00:12:29] <Cork> ?demo
[00:12:29] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:13:05] <Verzlo> I forgot about that
[00:13:09] <Verzlo> Hold on
[00:13:20] <symfonius> Cork: it was supposed to be like {'1': 'item_number'}
[00:13:32] <symfonius> so 1 is my equivalent to 'a' in your example
[00:13:36] <Verzlo> I get this also 'Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'close''
[00:13:39] <Cork> symfonius: could you make a fiddle too?
[00:13:46] <symfonius> sure
[00:14:05] <symfonius> oh hang on, I just realised my json was malformed... was just a list of values with no keys :P
[00:14:37] <Cork> symfonius: that sounds like it is what you actually want
[00:14:48] <Cork> symfonius: that would be a straight array, and simpler to work with
[00:15:04] <symfonius> nah, in my script I only have access to a list of ids
[00:15:13] <symfonius> I need to use this, to convert that id to a piece of text
[00:15:19] <symfonius> say.... 1 maps to "item_number"
[00:15:38] <Cork> so use ["", "item_number"]
[00:15:49] <Cork> as long as the id's are sequensial that is
[00:15:52] <symfonius> it's not in order though
[00:15:56] <Cork> ah
[00:15:57] <symfonius> it could go 1, 2, 170, 180
[00:16:18] <Cork> symfonius: though that said
[00:16:25] <Cork> don't make an array of the objects
[00:16:30] <Cork> just use one big object
[00:16:53] <Cork> { "1": "item_number", "2":"something", "170":"something else" }
[00:17:02] <Cork> that would again make things much simpler
[00:17:03] <symfonius> it's done dynamically in php though
[00:17:08] <Cork> you can do that
[00:17:17] <symfonius> i've got a php array, which twig/symfony json_encodes
[00:17:25] <Cork> just use there assosiative arrays (i think it is called if i remember correctly
[00:17:38] <symfonius> yes: { "1": "item_number", "2":"something", "170":"something else" }
[00:17:41] <symfonius> thats what I'm trying to get
[00:17:55] <Cork> json_encode(array("key"=>"value")) => {"key":"value"}
[00:18:01] <symfonius> for some reason symfony is encodign it as like, { "item_number","something", "something else" }
[00:18:14] <Cork> ouch that isn't valid
[00:18:24] <symfonius> yeah thats the style of array i'm using in php, i'm just trying to find out why it's losing the key
[00:18:30] <Cork> json_encode(array("key"=>"value")) => {"key":"value"} <--
[00:18:31] <symfonius> sorry.... replace { with [
[00:18:32] <Cork> this is what you want
[00:18:58] <symfonius> yep thats what i've got
[00:18:59] <Cork> it becomes heaps easier to deal with if you do that
[00:19:06] <symfonius> i think i've messed up an array_merge somewhere though
[00:19:12] <Cork> prob
[00:19:15] <symfonius> and i'm jsut getting values, no keys
[00:19:55] <Cork> symfonius: but my point is do array("1"=>"item_number", "2"=>"something")
[00:20:04] <symfonius> yeah thats what I have
[00:20:08] <symfonius> I have two arrays like that
[00:20:11] <symfonius> which I array_merge
[00:20:12] <Cork> symfonius: not array(array("1"=>"item_number"), array("2"=>"something"))
[00:20:38] <Cork> the first you can look up in without looping
[00:20:46] <Cork> and it becomes much much easier to deal with
[00:20:52] <symfonius> verbatim it looks like this
[00:20:56] <symfonius> $items = array(             Constants::ORDER_NUMBER_1                                => 'item_number',
[00:21:20] <symfonius> with the "Constants::ORDER_NUMBER_1                                => 'item_number'," part repeated a few dozen times with different keys and strings
[00:21:25] <jop007> In jq mobile 1.4.5 I use <input placeholder="9999XX"in my browser Chrome W7 I see placeholder 9999xx why is this changed?
[00:21:32] <symfonius> then there's another array just like it, which i array_merge
[00:22:10] <symfonius> just stepping through the PHP code though, the array_merge appears to be stripping the keys out though just leaving my values
[00:22:24] <symfonius> but thats okay, php problems I can figure out
[00:22:34] <symfonius> jquery is the area I am new :)
[00:23:37] <Cork> symfonius: ok, so if you manage php to generate {"key":value,"key":value,"key":value}
[00:24:09] <Cork> symfonius: then you just have to do obj[key] to access it
[00:24:14] <symfonius> yeah when i've got it merging correctly then I'll try: var arr = [{ a: 1 },{ b:1 }]; var keyword = 'a'; print(JSON.stringify(arr.filter(function(elm) { return keyword in elm; })[0][keyword]));
[00:24:17] <Cork> it will be undefined if it doesn't exist
[00:24:24] <Cork> so no need for filter or anything
[00:26:42] <symfonius> Cork: would you believe it: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3292071
[00:26:49] <symfonius> $array = $a + $b;
[00:26:54] <symfonius> retains the keys
[00:27:03] <symfonius> $array = array_merge($a, $b); flattens it
[00:27:21] <Cork> ya, i'm not a heavy php user since quite a bit now
[00:27:28] <Cork> but ya arrays is... special in php
[00:27:40] <symfonius> yeah, $a + $b feels like a sort of Perl type thing
[00:27:55] <symfonius> i naturally assumed it would be done via a function in php
[00:27:57] <Cork> i wish they splitted hashes and arrays like every other freaking language does
[00:28:36] <symfonius> I do like the way php handles arrays though
[00:28:52] <symfonius> admittedly, there's next to no level of strictness
[00:28:58] <symfonius> you can do pretty much whatever you want
[00:29:56] <symfonius> but that flexibility can be good. i'll be doing something in java and just require a very simple object type thing... you end up needing a key value pair or writing a new class, for something that would take 10 sec to write in a php array
[00:29:57] <DragonPunch> is there a way to press [Enter] to send
[00:30:19] <Cork> heh that was random
[00:30:32] <Cork> DragonPunch: could you possibly share some context?
[00:30:43] <Cork> like enter where, to send what?
[00:31:03] <DragonPunch> okay i have a input box. not wrapped in a form.. its just a input box and when you click a button it sends the data inside of that box via AJAX to my server
[00:31:13] <DragonPunch> but i want isntead of having to click the button you can press the enter key
[00:31:29] <Cork> DragonPunch: wrap the input field in a form
[00:31:35] <Cork> make the button a submit button
[00:31:40] <Cork> and bind submit on the form
[00:31:59] <Cork> always use <form> when you want to send data to the server
[00:32:15] <Cork> or accept user input in any form actually
[00:32:27] <DragonPunch> cork: i can't. it will send the form to '' whcih does page refrs
[00:32:34] <DragonPunch> im sending data via AJAX
[00:32:38] <Cork> ok?
[00:32:45] <Cork> that doesn't really matter
[00:32:56] <Cork> just event.preventDefault() the submit event
[00:33:07] <Cork> the form tag only have to be <form> nothing more
[00:33:39] <Cork> DragonPunch: the <form> tag is vital for the browser to have a clue what it is you're trying to do
[00:34:08] <Cork> lots of things in the browser depends on the form tag
[00:34:42] <DragonPunch> Cork: but my button is an <img>
[00:34:52] <DragonPunch> i cant use the submit button
[00:35:03] <Cork> so use <button> and use the image in css
[00:35:11] <DragonPunch> no not button
[00:35:15] <DragonPunch> i need to use submit
[00:35:24] <Cork> uh, <button> IS submit
[00:35:32] <DragonPunch> <input type="submit">
[00:35:39] <DragonPunch> vs <button>asdf</button>
[00:35:48] <Cork> <button></button> === <button type="submit"></button>
[00:36:07] <Cork> so yes <button> is a submit button
[00:36:10] <DragonPunch> okay.
[00:36:17] <symfonius> var item = commonItems.filter(function(commonItemObject) {                            .... Getting "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" on that line
[00:36:31] <Cork> symfonius: again you're not working with an array
[00:36:33] <Cork> you don't need filter
[00:36:48] <symfonius> ah sorry
[00:36:49] <symfonius> yes
[00:36:53] <symfonius> it's just oen big object
[00:36:59] <symfonius> sorry
[00:37:06] <Cork> i gave you how to work with it a while back
[00:37:21] <Cork> (10 mins ago)
[00:37:27] <symfonius> [15:24] <Cork> symfonius: then you just have to do obj[key] to access it
[00:37:31] <Cork> yes
[00:37:54] <symfonius> != undefined  -or-  !== undefined
[00:37:56] <symfonius> does it matter?
[00:38:01] <Cork> no
[00:38:17] <Cork> != undefined works with null
[00:38:23] <Cork> that's about the only difference
[00:38:42] <Cork> js> print(null != undefined)
[00:38:46] <b-ot> Cork: false
[00:38:48] <Cork> js> print(null !== undefined)
[00:38:51] <b-ot> Cork: true
[00:40:30] <symfonius> phew, finally working
[00:40:34] <symfonius> thanks for your patience Cork
[00:40:39] <Cork> np
[00:42:42] <tech-ninja> Cork: wtf, really?
[00:43:10] <tech-ninja> is the double == looking for literal string?
[00:44:20] <Cork> tech-ninja: == checks if the value is "alike" or "equal"
[00:44:30] <Cork> tech-ninja: while === checks if the value is identical
[00:44:42] <Cork> js> print(false == "")
[00:44:45] <b-ot> Cork: true
[00:44:45] <Cork> js> print(false === "")
[00:44:50] <b-ot> Cork: false
[00:45:03] <Cork> js> print(true == {})
[00:45:05] <Cork> js> print(true === {})
[00:45:06] <b-ot> Cork: false
[00:45:11] <b-ot> Cork: false
[00:45:14] <Cork> uh
[00:45:28] <Cork> {} is falsy??
[00:45:31] <tech-ninja> so des!
[00:45:52] <tech-ninja> this has always been a trial and error experiment for me, and usually i just run with double ==
[00:46:17] <Cork> == has it's neat features
[00:46:26] <Cork> js> print("true" === true)
[00:46:28] <Cork> for example :)
[00:46:29] <b-ot> Cork: false
[00:46:35] <Cork> wtf...
[00:46:39] * Cork pokes the bot
[00:46:54] <tech-ninja> lol
[00:47:02] <Cork> ah -_-'
[00:47:10] <Cork> it's 1 not true
[00:47:15] <Cork> js> print("1" === true)
[00:47:18] <b-ot> Cork: false
[00:47:22] <Cork> js> print("1" == true)
[00:47:25] <b-ot> Cork: true
[00:47:39] <tech-ninja> any logic to this?
[00:48:03] <tech-ninja> ‚Äú1‚Äù has to be identical to ‚Äú1‚Äù unless it‚Äôs a different instance
[00:48:06] <Cork> when you use != or == the engine tries to convert the two values to the same type
[00:48:19] <Cork> while !== === doesn't
[00:48:29] <symfonius> One final question, say I have    var itemObj = {         "item_number": 0, "something": 0 }   ................                item_number is the one I want to update.           item_number is stored in "var keyName = obj[key];"
[00:48:48] <symfonius> Can I do itemObj.keyName = "whatever"; ?
[00:49:00] <symfonius> or will it think keyName is a key itself?
[00:49:01] <tech-ninja> ahh! ther‚Äôs probably a better performance boost if you know if the will be identical and can use === huh?
[00:49:03] <Cork> symfonius: no
[00:49:09] <symfonius> SHould I do, itemObj[keyName] ?
[00:49:16] <Cork> symfonius: keyName will be the number not key keyname
[00:49:58] <Cork> var key = "item_number"; if(obj[key] != undefined) { obj[key] = "whatever" }
[00:50:10] <Cork> or
[00:50:14] <symfonius> ok, i'll try that now
[00:50:15] <Cork> var key = "item_number"; if(obj[key] != undefined) { obj[key]++; }
[00:50:21] <Cork> or
[00:50:52] <Cork> var key = "item_number"; obj[key] = obj[key] || 0; obj[key]++;
[00:51:21] <Cork> tech-ninja: you might want to read up on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators
[00:52:16] <symfonius> that first one worked - cheers Cork
[00:52:34] <Cork> it's just different ways depending on what you want to do :)
[00:54:49] <tech-ninja> sweet, i‚Äôm gonna have to spend my whole weekend on the mdn .. there‚Äôs just too much to learn! lol
[00:55:07] <sadtaco> How do I add an element after another that's not appended yet?  ie var $el = $('<div />');   $('<div class="foo" />').insertAfter( $el );  $el.appendTo('body');  the div with the class foo won't appear.
[00:55:31] <Cork> sadtaco: just use .add
[00:55:55] <Cork> the element isn't in a document so there isn't anywhere to append to
[00:56:04] <sadtaco> Right
[00:56:04] <Cork> so just include it in the set of elements
[00:56:19] <Cork> note though that .add doesn't modify the object
[00:56:19] <sadtaco> I hope there is a reverse of that.
[00:56:21] <Cork> it reaturns a new one
[00:56:28] <Cork> .filter
[00:57:13] <sadtaco> well .add() isn't working
[00:57:35] <sadtaco> var $el = $('<div />');  var $child = $('<div class="foo" />');  $el.add( $child );  $el.appendTo('body');
[00:57:46] <Cork> sadtaco: read what i just said
[00:58:17] <sadtaco> k done
[00:59:03] <thinced> $el.append($child);
[00:59:28] <sadtaco> http://jsbin.com/tofebakeyo/1/edit?html,js,output
[00:59:31] <sadtaco> thinced, nope.
[00:59:40] <sadtaco> wait
[00:59:44] <sadtaco> yeah no
[00:59:45] <Cork> ugg don't use jsbin
[00:59:49] <sadtaco> I need it inserted after not apepnded
[00:59:49] <Cork> it sucks
[00:59:53] <sadtaco> What should I use?
[00:59:56] <sadtaco> jsfiddle is broken
[01:00:09] <Cork> anything that actually let you save the modifications
[01:00:21] <Cork> jsbin loses changes left right and center
[01:00:21] <crandersons> add should be .append() right?
[01:00:27] <Cork> no
[01:00:28] <sadtaco> no...
[01:00:31] <sadtaco> I need to insert after
[01:00:32] <sadtaco> not append
[01:00:38] <crandersons> i just chimmed in
[01:00:45] * crandersons walks away
[01:00:52] <Cork> sadtaco: you still haven't read my note about .add...
[01:00:55] <sadtaco> I need to insertAfter when it isn't yet appended to the page
[01:00:59] <thinced> sadtaco: prepend ;)
[01:01:06] <Cork> <Cork> note though that .add doesn't modify the object
[01:01:08] <sadtaco> You just said "just use .add"
[01:01:13] <Cork> no i didn't
[01:01:24] <Cork> <Cork> it reaturns a new one
[01:01:35] <Cork> so currently you don't store the result of .add
[01:01:41] <sadtaco> Ohh.
[01:02:02] <Cork> you could use $el.add().appendTo though
[01:02:04] <sadtaco> http://jsbin.com/qanekucupa/1/edit
[01:02:19] <sadtaco> ty
[01:02:43] <DragonPunch> Cork: after i bind the button with the form.. say if i press enter.
[01:02:56] <DragonPunch> will it 'act' like someone clicked the button?
[01:03:00] <Cork> DragonPunch: you don't bind the button with the form
[01:03:16] <Cork> DragonPunch: just put the <button> in the form
[01:03:22] <Cork> and clicking it will fire the forms submit event
[01:03:37] <Cork> just like enter will do
[01:03:40] <DragonPunch> yeah but
[01:04:02] <Cork> *sigh*
[01:04:05] <DragonPunch> i have code that gets excuted via jQUERY/javascript when the "message-send-button" on "click"
[01:04:19] <DragonPunch> pressing the enter button won't execute that code.
[01:04:26] <Kartagis> why would $this be not defined? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xqz7r051/1/
[01:04:30] <sadtaco> so.. execute it on submit() instead
[01:04:53] <Uhkis> Kartagis: $(this)
[01:04:57] <sadtaco> cause you didn't define $this
[01:05:23] <Cork> DragonPunch: http://jsfiddle.net/e7jLb8kr/
[01:08:21] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xqz7r051/2/ I got all rusty. why isn't this working as desired
[01:08:39] <Cork> Kartagis: .val is a function
[01:08:51] <sadtaco> ...
[01:08:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xqz7r051/3/
[01:08:55] <DragonPunch> Cork: ohhh so you would use on submit okay okay thanks so mch. what if there are 2 buttons?
[01:09:18] <Cork> DragonPunch: then the second one would be a <button type="button"></button>
[01:09:26] <Cork> as you can't have two separate submit events on a form
[01:09:30] <DragonPunch> ahhhhhhhhhhh
[01:09:31] <DragonPunch> i see.
[01:09:41] <DragonPunch> sweet. thanks pal.
[01:09:45] <Cork> but actually unless the second one is to clear the form i wouldn't ever do that
[01:10:01] <Cork> i would use radio/checkboxes if there is to be different actions
[01:10:03] <Kartagis> thanks Cork
[01:10:19] <Cork> separating actions depending on what button you click is bad ui
[01:10:36] <Cork> cause if you happen to hit enter you don't know what effect you get
[01:10:57] <jop007> In jq mobile 1.4.5 I use <input placeholder="9999XX"in my browser Chrome W7 I see placeholder 9999xx why is this changed?
[02:03:27] <symfonius> Cork and tech-ninja: thanks for your help earlier
[02:03:31] <symfonius> have a great Easter
[02:03:39] <Cork> same
[02:03:48] <symfonius> bye
[02:20:09] <ServerSage> Hey folks, what is the best way to disable a form and all it's inputs with jQuery?  I've tried $('#formID').attr('disabled', 'disabled') but that seems to have no effect.
[02:20:32] <Cork> ServerSage: 1. never EVER set state with .attr
[02:20:39] <ServerSage> *affect
[02:20:44] <ServerSage> Cork: Ok
[02:20:45] <Cork> 2. you would have to set it on each element separately
[02:21:03] <Cork> so $('#formID :input').prop('disabled', true)
[02:22:08] <ServerSage> Cork: Aah, ok.  So set it for each input.  Got it.  Unforutnately, it's an old ass version of jQuery so .prop isn't available.
[02:22:28] <Cork> ah, ok so in older version use .attr('disabled', true/false
[02:22:38] <Cork> attr was split in jquery 1.5
[02:22:47] <ServerSage> Yeah, this client is stuck on 1.44
[02:22:49] <Cork> and prop is the function to use now days
[02:23:01] <ServerSage> Er, 1.4  :)
[02:23:15] <ServerSage> Thanks for the assist Cork, much appreciated.
[02:23:19] <Cork> np
[02:31:52] <ServerSage> Cork:  Worked a treat.
[02:32:04] <bmh_25> Anybody know if jquery and dojo can be used alongside? anything i have to watch out for? thx
[02:33:27] <Cork> bmh_25: jquery is written in a way that it can coexist with basically other framework as long as that framework doesn't break natives too badly
[02:33:28] <Xatenev> bmh_25: You can use them beside each other with no issues because Dojo does not override $ like some other javascript libraries.
[02:33:35] <Cork> (extending Array or Object for example)
[02:34:01] <Cork> *basically any other
[02:34:34] <sanjayb> hey Cork, could you point me to any resources on why " 1. never EVER set state with .attr" ? I'm still so used to using .attr :( .. but I should probably read up and change my ways ..
[02:34:58] <Cork> sanjayb: that statement is only true for jquery >= 1.5
[02:35:08] <Cork> sanjayb: cause you are setting the attribute of the element, not the property
[02:35:12] <bmh_25> Cork, thx, okay.
[02:35:25] <Cork> and that doesn't actually change the state in all browsers
[02:35:56] <Cork> sanjayb: the way you should look at it is instead what few corner cases should you still be using .attr
[02:36:07] <Cork> as you should basically always use .prop instead
[02:36:11] <sanjayb> Cork, right, I see .. I remember some similar discussions on using .attr vs. .data .. I got scared of all the new-fangledness and still use .attr .. but yea, reading up now, shall amend my ways :-)
[02:36:19] <Babcom> hello every one
[02:36:41] <sanjayb> right, reading up a bit, can see that ... ah, but what fun would javascript be without 300 corner cases to watch out for .. :P
[02:37:00] <Cork> sanjayb: basically, before 1.5 jquery did a magic dance and used the property of the element except for a few cases where it used getAttribute
[02:37:15] <Cork> sanjayb: this broke cases when you actually wanted the attribute/property
[02:37:29] <Cork> sanjayb: so in 1.5 attr was split into .attr and .prop and the magic removed
[02:37:49] <Cork> sanjayb: what 99% of ppl used .attr for before is now in .prop and that is why you should use .prop instead
[02:38:02] <sanjayb> right .. sure sure, I see that .. and I've run into those before .. usually though I'm also the one authoring the html so I have strict ways of how I do it, so it hasn't bit me too bad .. but I can see where it would get really rough if you had attributes defined slightly different in html, etc..
[02:38:13] <sanjayb> Cork, right, I see that. thanks so much. :)
[02:38:18] <Cork> sanjayb: .attr is good if you want the html value before the browser normalize it
[02:38:32] <Cork> like ex. .attr('href') on a <a href="#top"> link
[02:38:56] <Cork> .prop('href') == 'http://www.example.com/path/index.html#top'
[02:39:00] <Babcom> I need some help on a website please; I can't figure what I am missing
[02:39:02] <Cork> .attr('href') == '#top'
[02:39:16] <Cork> ?ask @ Babcom
[02:39:16] <b-ot> Babcom: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:39:34] <sanjayb> yeep .. .attr is always the literal value in the attribute .. which is often what I want, before the browser does any magic :) -- but yes, I also see why in most sane cases, one would want to use .prop ..
[02:39:59] <Cork> sanjayb: actually, no it is almost never what you want
[02:40:13] <Cork> cause if you change that value, it normally doesn't affect the running page
[02:40:15] <Babcom> ok this is a template : http://larchedivine.com/fileadmin/templates/main/index.html and this is my webiste base on this template : http://larchedivine.com/accueil/
[02:40:32] <Babcom> on the first one when cliking on Start there is an animation going down
[02:40:40] <Babcom> It doesn't work on the second one
[02:42:05] <Babcom> maybe I am missing an initialisation somewhere, but I don't know where or when
[02:42:38] <Cork> Babcom: do you have a specific jquery question
[02:43:06] <Babcom> no, I thought it was a jquery issue
[02:43:29] <Cork> ok, i have to run (lunch)
[02:43:30] <sanjayb> Cork, things generally worked fine with .attr in the pre 1.5 days. but I definitely see why .attr is bad practice and should only be used when you actually know you want .attr, which as you say, is probably less than 0.1% of the time.
[02:46:16] <sanjayb> Babcom, http://larchedivine.com/fileadmin/templates/main/index.html doesn't open in my browser. it would be more helpful if you could try and reduce the problem and paste code somewhere
[02:46:55] <Schabo> I have a simple .ajax function that triggers the .fail even though I get a success. I can't figure out why it would trigger the .fail everytime. Any ideas on how to find out why it fails? jQuery 1.10.2
[02:47:30] <c0d3n4m3> Paste the code to hastebin so we can take a look
[02:47:37] <Schabo> sure, sec
[02:47:43] <Babcom> sanjayb: ok I'll try to find the problem then
[02:48:35] <leporello> Hi. I need to set css transition time depending on button size. If i do it with :hover selector i have only one effect, but with jquery i have two effects - direct on mouseenter and reverse on moseleave. What do I need to prevent reverse effect? Or how can i set :hover style with jquery?
[02:48:47] <Schabo> http://pastebin.com/3Gi5FGdQ
[02:49:03] <c0d3n4m3> I'll take a look now for you
[02:49:10] <Schabo> thanks
[02:53:03] <Schabo> oh, I don't post any data... I've remade that function several times and probably forgot to change to "GET" when testing. Would that trigger the fail since no POST data?
[02:55:56] <Elirips> Hello. Is there something built-in into jquery that will copy all properties of object 'x' into object 'y' ?
[02:56:16] <Elirips> overwritting them if they already exists, creating them if they do not exist yet
[03:00:46] <Babcom> Please look this two code : http://pastebin.com/duyR7kne and this one : http://pastebin.com/a2Pc7NPG
[03:01:03] <Babcom> the first doesn't work, and the second does
[03:01:24] <Babcom> when I say it works, I mean there is a scroll to the destination link
[03:01:34] <leporello> oh, i just needed to set transition-timing-function to step-start
[03:02:41] <sanjayb> Babcom, you would need to post also the JS that's responsible for the actual scrolling function ..
[03:02:49] <sanjayb> ?fiddle @Babcom
[03:02:53] <Babcom> ok
[03:03:07] <Omar-> `paste @ Babcom
[03:03:08] <b-ot> Babcom: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:03:13] <sanjayb> that didn't work .. err .. use http://jsfiddle.net
[03:03:16] <sanjayb> ahh, thanks Omar :)
[03:03:20] <Omar-> sanjayb ;)
[03:04:08] <FilipNortic> do people still use <i> tags?
[03:04:30] <Omar-> found this in fixee.org lol http://fixee.org/paste/i6qgeon/
[03:04:31] <sanjayb> Schabo, that might be the problem, yes .. although, for what you are doing, it seems like you would be well advised to use POST and not GET
[03:04:43] <Omar-> FilipNortic fontawesome uses it
[03:05:20] <Schabo> sanjayb, yes, it is supposed to be a POST but I'vee been fiddling around with it testing trying to get it to not fail...
[03:05:53] <sanjayb> Schabo, right I see. yep, you should probably be sending the correct http verb that the server expects :)
[03:06:08] <Schabo> It takes both post and get
[03:06:18] <Schabo> and I get a 200 Ok back too
[03:06:31] <sanjayb> but it doesn't trigger the success callback?
[03:06:45] <Schabo> It does what it's supposed to do in the api.php file, but it always triggers the .fail
[03:07:54] <sanjayb> Schabo, this .. is strange .. inspecting network in console shows you a 200 response, etc?
[03:08:07] <Schabo> yes, 200
[03:08:22] <Babcom> Omar-:  sorry for beeing such a newbie but I don't understand how jsfiddle work
[03:08:32] <Schabo> readyState 4, http 200 Ok, method POST and so on, looks correct to me
[03:09:27] <Babcom> ok found it : there is the link : https://jsfiddle.net/4fc8fw99/
[03:09:42] <Omar-> Babcom it's simple, you have 4 sections, HTML (top/left), CSS (top/right), JS(bottom/left) and result (bottom/right)
[03:09:49] <sanjayb> Schabo, darn that sounds strange .. wish I could dig in and help, but gotta run, client just over :/ .. atb ..
[03:10:02] <Babcom> sanjayb:  ok thx :'(
[03:10:05] <Schabo> I'll keep trying :) Thanks for the help!
[03:10:33] <Omar-> Babcom the code is minified, we cant debug such code :)
[03:10:57] <Babcom> Omar-:  yes whit explanation I undertand now :)
[03:19:52] <wrock> heyo..regarding $(..)load(..))....it is actually a get request yeah? so if i would use $( "#recent_works" ).load( "/ #recent_works"); and  $( "#recent_posts" ).load( "/ #recent_posts"); it actually loads the webpage over the net, and parses the content out of it... correct?
[03:20:20] <wrock> it loads 2 times the page

[04:00:47] <wrock> the second time, does it load the page a second time or is it buffered and it just parses out the next #
[04:08:39] <yudz> I am trying to use the slick.js jquery plugin. The slick.css and slick.min.js are correctly arriving to the browser. I am using the package as demonstrated here (https://dpaste.de/LZye) but i just get a list of the divs and none of the extra classes seem to be applied in the inspector as they are at http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

[04:12:53] <wrock> yudz: line 961
[04:12:57] <wrock> it starts with a (
[04:13:05] <wrock> youre sure the syntax is correct?
[04:14:58] <wrock> * on the page, not your pastebi
[04:15:30] <yudz> wrock, you dont have access to the page?
[04:15:40] <yudz> im not sure which line you're reffering to...
[04:16:06] <yudz> 961 in that pastebin is a closing ul tag

[04:16:41] <basiclaser> Is it possible to use serializeArray() across a whole webpage? I have a very complicated form which goes across three 'tabs', with a lot of node nesting and so on. When I call serializeArray on a parent ID, the array is empty
[04:17:03] <wrock> did you try to debug with firebug?
[04:17:20] <basiclaser> wrock: me?
[04:17:28] <wrock> no
[04:17:32] <basiclaser> lel
[04:17:41] <yudz> wrock, you mean via the console? haven't. i dont even know where to start; i'm much more experienced in python than javascript
[04:22:25] <wrock> actually dont know, but what i can recognize  from http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ that there is javascript executed at the end of the page, on yours it isnt, maybe you can start to look there
[04:25:25] <yudz> wrock, what js are you noticing that is executing there but not on mine?
[04:29:03] <wrock> <script type="text/javascript">         var disqus_shortname = 'slickcarousel';          (function() {             var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;             dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';             (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);         })();     </script>
[04:29:30] <sacho_> paste on jsfiddle or jsbin
[04:29:32] <wrock> right click: view page source
[04:30:40] <yudz> wrock, that seems to be disqus initialisation code
[04:32:10] <sacho_> basiclaser, assuming they're all wrapped in forms, select the forms and serializeArray()
[04:32:42] <basiclaser> sacho_: badoy! :p thanks
[04:42:53] <Schabo> Can someone help me figuring out why only .fail gets triggered even though I get "200 Ok" as status code on the ajax request? I can't figure this one out at all
[04:43:10] <Schabo> oh... and here is the code: http://hastebin.com/ihasimotus.coffee
[04:46:08] <sacho_> JSON.parse..?
[04:46:23] <Schabo> yeah?
[04:46:29] <sacho_> and comparing to "undefined"?
[04:46:33] <sacho_> neither of those things make sense
[04:46:53] <sacho_> don't use alerts to debug - use a debugger
[04:47:11] <Schabo> Using Chrome dev tools for debugging
[04:47:13] <sacho_> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging
[04:47:37] <Schabo> The POSt get√§s made and the api.php does it's thing and works fine.
[04:48:02] <Schabo> It should trigger the .done but instead triggers the .fail
[04:48:31] <sacho_> so what's the response you get in the .fail
[04:49:07] <Schabo> I get a Object there.. with readyState and so on, it looks correct to me (as a success)
[04:49:28] <sacho_> can you paste what it actually contains?
[04:49:46] <Schabo> I assume you want the headers?
[04:49:55] <sacho_> no, I want the whole object
[04:50:23] <Schabo> Not sure how to post it for you
[04:51:48] <sacho_> JSON.stringify(res, null, 4)
[04:52:01] <Schabo> thanks... sec
[04:52:25] <sacho_> var sendme = { cmd: 'save', frm: 'msg', id: to, user: user, msg: msg }
[04:52:30] <sacho_> instead of the JSON.parse()
[04:53:34] <kostodo> Anyone know how I can add a custom class (on a particular condition) to #ui-datepicker-div in jquery datepicker?
[04:53:42] <kostodo> it doesnt exist until you click the date field
[04:54:06] <Schabo> sacho_, http://hastebin.com/gikoribequ.tex
[04:54:49] <Schabo> I actually knew that about JSON.parse, but I don't know why I did it this way... thanks
[04:55:06] <basiclaser> are there any tutorials on making internal page 'routes' depending on which buttons are clicked? eg. clicking on 'footer' jumps to the footer, and that is reflected in the URL with /#footer or something ?? thanks :)
[04:55:47] <Schabo> sacho_, I made that change and now it triggers .done
[04:55:57] <Schabo> That's a bit interesting though, no?
[04:56:16] <sacho_> why?
[04:56:32] <Schabo> oh, wait... nevermind
[04:57:55] <Schabo> still fails
[05:06:05] <Schabo> sacho_, Any ideas?
[05:16:14] * sacho_ shrugs
[05:16:18] <sacho_> make a reproducible test case
[05:17:54] <Schabo> hmm... alright...
[05:18:58] <Schabo> But from what you know the .ajax call/code is correct? I'm not doing anything wrong there? So the problem is in the reply from api.php or perhaps a bug?
[05:21:43] <Schabo> I might make a testcase... but for now I don't have the time to do it.
[05:22:02] <fougere> Schabo, What the issue (just got in the chan)
[05:22:39] <Schabo> I have a .ajax request that only triggers .fail even though the request is a success.
[05:24:30] <Schabo> http://hastebin.com/ilofijeluk.coffee here's the current code for the .ajax request
[05:25:13] <Schabo> Here's the response, http://hastebin.com/gikoribequ.tex
[05:27:48] <Elirips> Hello. One last question about the datepicker: Whenever I select a date / time in the datetimepicker, it will immediately update the parent edit control. But I would like to prevent this control from being updated, until the user clickes the 'Done' button. Is this possibl?
[05:34:45] <Schabo> fougere, I can't find anything wrong on this. I got other .ajax requests working fine, but this one just wont play along. Maybe it's something in the response even though it looks correct...

[06:00:51] <foxfire> hi all i have a problem i am unable to make ajax GET request
[06:01:16] <foxfire> from chrome browser on iPhone device
[06:01:31] <foxfire> can anyone help me
[06:01:32] <foxfire> ?
[06:04:53] <notchris> Good morning
[06:07:00] <arthurvr> morning notchris
[06:07:07] <notchris> arthurvr: How‚Äôs it going?
[06:07:26] <arthurvr> all going well :) Where are you up to today?
[06:07:48] <notchris> Good to hear!
[06:07:56] <notchris> Just got a SSL cert on my works website
[06:08:02] <juppppp> Hey arthur
[06:08:03] <notchris> So making sure everything is secure, ect
[06:08:24] <arthurvr> notchris: Yeah. Kind of a boring work to do but it‚Äôs important huh
[06:08:41] <notchris> arthurvr: Yeah it‚Äôs good to learn!
[06:08:50] <notchris> I‚Äôm trying to figure out something more difficult today though
[06:08:56] <notchris> We have an external ticketing website
[06:09:10] <notchris> I‚Äôm trying to see if I can authenticate our main website to pull content from that page
[06:09:14] <notchris> Without using an iframe
[06:09:19] <notchris> And still be able to submit forms ect...
[06:09:21] <wheeei> about to lose my mind, I have been working on small bug all day. I just finished a mobile menu but when you focus the login-form input-field it triggers the mobile menus toggle somehow and collapses. At first I was sure that e.stopPropagation(); would solve the problem but it doesnt and nothing else I've tried either :(
[06:09:38] <notchris> wheeei: Post example, I‚Äôll help
[06:09:56] <arthurvr> jsbin would be nice indeed :)
[06:10:09] <juppppp> arthurvr, We talk yesterday about an issue with a lot of checkboxxes
[06:10:32] <arthurvr> juppppp: yeah remember something like that. sup?
[06:11:08] <juppppp> I found out the Remote-validation went wrong and rewrote a line in jquery-validation.js. Do you know where to send it to so it will be taken into the lib?
[06:12:06] <arthurvr> juppppp: The repo is at https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation
[06:12:29] <arthurvr> juppppp: Is that the plugin you mean?
[06:12:33] <juppppp> thanks, I'll check into that
[06:12:36] <juppppp> yeah it is
[06:12:52] <arthurvr> Awesome. Check if there wasn‚Äôt any duplicate issue or PR before, of course.
[06:13:14] <juppppp> it's an issue with the find(":input") which is pretty slow
[06:13:57] <juppppp> I'm not sure why but we had to change it a year ago in another piece of code aswell
[06:16:47] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/XeGZ  why it doesnt download .zip file? it works if i go to /storage/resource/download_zip/  without ajax
[06:20:52] <foxfire> hi all
[06:20:56] <foxfire> can anyone help me
[06:20:57] <arthurvr> hi foxfire
[06:21:02] <arthurvr> !ask @ foxfire
[06:21:02] <b-ot> foxfire: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:21:41] <sacrebleu> I use $.ajax() to return a page and during that process I execute $('#somediv').html(response); ... in the done() function .. when I do this, it executes the code in "response" twice.. why?
[06:22:03] <foxfire> i have a problem i am unable to make ajax GET request
[06:22:18] <foxfire> with Accept headers from chrome browser on iPhone device
[06:22:28] <arthurvr> sacrebleu: foxfire: Both of you, could you make a fiddle?
[06:22:54] <foxfire> sure
[06:23:00] <sacrebleu> i suppose...
[06:24:27] <sacrebleu> arthurvr: its not really possible to fiddle it?  how would I return a page with JS embedded in it?
[06:25:04] <foxfire> this is the sample https://jsfiddle.net/myfeyuL1/
[06:25:16] <foxfire> arthurvr: ^
[06:25:39] <foxfire> this ajax req works on adnroid device but not on iPhone
[06:25:43] <foxfire> chrome browser
[06:25:49] <foxfire> not sure why
[06:26:25] <arthurvr> foxfire: That should work though. Is an issue with the phone or with the setup of the rest of your page.
[06:26:52] <foxfire> hmm
[06:26:57] <basiclaser> when console.logging an array of objects, how can i make it so that it doesnt just print out [object,object,object]
[06:27:26] <foxfire> arthurvr: is it possible that iOS is stopiing the AJAX requests
[06:28:10] <arthurvr> basiclaser: could use console.dir if you prefer that but I don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt want that. You can open the object by clicking on it.
[06:30:55] <notchris> How do I authenticate a site to be able to submit / modify content in an iframe?
[06:37:26] <sacrebleu> arthurvr: found it..
[06:37:44] <arthurvr> Glad to hear that.
[06:44:10] <notchris> Can I authenticate same-origin using jquery?
[06:49:32] <tofra> Anyone worked with the plugin datatable (from datatables.net)?
[06:49:55] <tofra> This should work right? $('<table>').dataTable();
[06:52:46] <denete> not I
[07:10:02] <transverse> i have classes that have padding styles, I have jquery created elements with those classes but when they are created the padding styles are glitchy and done work, so padding-left: 10% will appear as 0% until refresh, then it fixes itself
[07:10:08] <bbclover> Hey guys, how do I trigger a click on a button whose inner text is "Cancel", which is a child of a div of a certain id?
[07:11:53] <transverse> bbclover: same way you normally would...
[07:12:44] <bbclover> I don't know how I would. I know about .click(); but this button doen't have an id/class
[07:12:55] <bbclover> so I wanted to look for it somehow by its inner text being "Cancel"
[07:13:22] <bbclover> this is very hacky, I know, but this button is generated on the fly by YUI and normally you'd just click it manually
[07:15:19] <transverse> bbclover: why not just give the button a class or id?
[07:15:46] <bbclover> ok I'llt ry
[07:20:49] <hackal> Hello does the .attr() accepts regex as parameter?
[07:22:20] <arthurvr> hackal: No, when would that be handy?
[07:22:53] <bbclover> couldn't figure out how to give the button a class in yui, but I found I could do $("#myDialog button:contains('Cancel')").click();
[07:23:52] <hackal> arthurvr: I have HTML where there is <a href="mailto:xxx@xxx.xx">abc</a> and I need to find that element and I need to extract the mail from it.
[07:24:50] <hackal> arthurvr: so I am looking for something like "find element with attribute starting with 'mailto:'"
[07:25:08] <arthurvr> hackal: But that has nothing to do with .attr(). Let me fiddle something for you.
[07:26:29] <midori-rus> hello. Some function in my scripts returns me a sting like this '240&#160;–º'. My question is howto replace html spec char to space?
[07:26:34] <arthurvr> hackal: is this what you‚Äôre searching for http://jsbin.com/lugeferisa/1/edit?js,output
[07:26:50] <midori-rus> I suggest that &#160; is a 1 space
[07:27:10] <transverse> bbclover: unless you have more than one button, you could just do: $('button').on('click', function...
[07:27:28] <hackal> arthurvr: yes, thank you very much for the example
[07:27:46] <bbclover> transverse: yeah, more than 1 button
[07:28:42] <hackal> arthurvr: well, but now I see your fiddle is looking for exact email. My problem is will not know the email.
[07:29:01] <arthurvr> oh that‚Äôs not difficult. 5 minutes and I‚Äôll fix that for you.
[07:29:27] <arthurvr> hackal: done http://jsbin.com/ruwuhopexa/1/edit
[07:30:34] <hackal> arthurvr: thank you again. Also I see you added ^ in front of the ="mailto:". What does it mean/do?
[07:30:47] <arthurvr> attribute starts with
[07:30:54] <arthurvr> It means that :)
[07:32:01] <hackal> arthurvr: Ok now I see, thank you
[07:33:13] <transverse> jquery created element with classes with padding styles not taking effect until page refresh..anyone heard of this bug?
[07:43:03] <arthurvr> transverse: would you mind doing a jsfiddle/bin?
[07:48:04] <transverse> the problem is, i would have to completely replicated my entire environment and send you my entire project...im just asking in general if this is something that happens when...for example you put your script file in the wrong order or your stylesheet in the wrong place, etc
[07:49:09] <arthurvr> transverse: That why I asked to reduce the problem to a small fiddle. The problem is likely not to be jQuery.
[07:51:45] <abailarri> Hello. I have a var that contains: Date {Thu Apr 09 2015 04:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)}, but if I put console.log(myvar.getMonth()) I get 3 instead 4. What can be the reasonø
[07:53:27] <shoky> abailarri: it starts with 0.  3 is april.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getMonth
[07:53:37] <transverse> arthurvr: http://pastebin.com/bT0mjdqW
[07:53:56] <abailarri> shoky, and If I want to pint somethinf like d/m/Y?
[07:54:05] <abailarri> from myvar that is a date?
[07:54:09] <arthurvr> abailarri: These months are zero-indexed.
[07:54:13] <arthurvr> js> new Date('1 January 2014').getMonth()
[07:54:20] <shoky> abailarri: then go ahead and do it
[07:54:24] <b-ot> arthurvr: No output.
[07:54:53] <abailarri> shoky, what?
[07:56:16] <shoky> abailarri: print whatever you want. you didn't ask a question
[07:56:46] <abailarri> shoky, but how can I print with concret format a date objetc'
[07:56:49] <abailarri> t?
[08:00:47] <shoky> abailarri: you just print whatever you want.  console.log(mydate.getDate() + '/' + (mydate.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + mydate.getFullYear())   or use a date library like moment.js
[08:01:11] <abailarri> aaa ok, then I add +1
[08:01:15] <abailarri> this was the question
[08:01:33] <shoky> i'm sure you didn't need me for that :\
[08:21:51] <lostManny> Id like to make a .HTA, from which I can select all of the text fields and their names from a different website.  Is this possible?
[08:32:09] <maxvi> is anybody know some library for jquery/backbone to create panels
[08:32:09] <maxvi>         (opened windows) and windows on the screen. I need create a lot of
[08:32:12] <maxvi>         parts of the web app on the screen, so windows like
[08:32:16] <maxvi>         chat/forms/content/iframe.
[08:33:03] <robertmaxrees> you can finish a sentence before you hit enter ;)
[08:34:09] <notchris> How can I test if CORS is working
[08:34:17] <notchris> Should I try manipulating content in the iframe?
[08:37:16] <robertmaxrees> notchris try to hit the site with ajax from another domain.
[08:37:26] <notchris> Hmm
[08:37:35] <maxvi> robertmaxrees: yes, just a mistake (copy/paste from another channel, didn't know that it will be pasted as many sentences :( sorry)
[08:38:11] <robertmaxrees> notchris or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12173990/how-can-you-debug-a-cors-request-with-curl
[08:38:32] <maxvi> so anybody know library to create/move/min/max/resize windows ?
[08:38:37] <robertmaxrees> maxvi either way, i've seen some libs that do that, but i can't remember them off the top of my head.
[08:42:04] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Could you please show me an exmaple?
[08:42:16] <robertmaxrees> notchris that link has examples on it.
[08:43:08] <notchris> Is that PHP?
[08:43:14] <robertmaxrees> it's cURL
[08:43:18] <robertmaxrees> command line utility.
[08:43:38] <robertmaxrees> http://curl.haxx.se/
[08:49:53] <maxvi> jquery (or ui) hasn't any tools to bind model/view by default?
[08:50:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:50:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery/jqui isn't an MVC lib.
[08:59:30] <creativename> sup
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> yo
[09:00:05] <creativename> sup robertmaxrees
[09:00:31] <creativename> I was wondering can I bind multiple classes to one on click event?
[09:00:34] <creativename> $('.refresh-button').click(function(e) {
[09:00:48] <robertmaxrees> sure - the jquery selector is just like css.
[09:01:00] <robertmaxrees> $('.refresh-button, .another-class, .foo');
[09:01:02] <creativename> something like $('.refresh-button' , '.refresh-widget').click(function(e) {
[09:01:11] <creativename> ahh ok so in one pair of quotes
[09:01:15] <robertmaxrees> just one string, yeah.
[09:01:20] <creativename> thanks bud
[09:01:36] <creativename> hows everything going?
[09:01:47] <robertmaxrees> eh, could be better, could be worse.  you?
[09:02:15] <sinious> has anyone dealt with rotating images? I'm amazed this is difficult (non-square images)
[09:02:23] <creativename> the same lol been so caught up with work havent had time to work on any of my personal stuff
[09:02:52] <robertmaxrees> sinious use css to do that.
[09:03:55] <sinious> robertmaxrees: I realize the transform will occur in CSS but some calculations need to be performed.. if the image isn't square, it'll need to be translated on x/y by some amount
[09:04:14] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[09:05:55] <sinious> if you rotate a non-square image in a container it's easy to see the browser starts to get erratic on the container calculations: (plunkr) http://tinyurl.com/kkegjzb
[09:06:30] <sinious> the container (red border) eventually doesn't match the image (blue border).. so the image gets clipped and the container scrollbars are all wrong
[09:07:05] <decx> fyi jquery css() already does the right prefix itself
[09:07:19] <sinious> the vendor prefixes?
[09:07:21] <decx> yep
[09:07:24] <sinious> good to know thanks
[09:09:04] <sinious> I read I should use max-width to be mobile friendly but it does appear to work better if I actually use width instead: http://tinyurl.com/qbxkslc
[09:09:30] <sinious> on chrome it's pretty bulletproof but firefox and IE end up randomly deciding to have tons of extra horizontal scroll
[09:10:03] <sinious> I'm only doing 90 degree turns, can't imagine what it'd take to get arbitrary angles working
[09:12:18] <basiclaser> hey guys, say i have an array of objects like this : objectName = [{name:"value-1",value:"bacon"},{name:"value-2",value:"cheese"},{name:"value-3",value:"profit"}] , How would I access the value by using the name? I am currently trying objectName["value-1"] and objectName["value-1"].value , but neither work. THANKS!
[09:12:55] <robertmaxrees> can you change the way the object is created?
[09:12:59] <robertmaxrees> or are you stuck with this format?
[09:16:07] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser because as is, you'd need to use .filter() or another similar method to get what you want.
[09:16:26] <maxvi> how can I add custom button to dialog ? buttons like close/minimize/maximize
[09:16:38] <maxvi> dialog has close button by default
[09:16:58] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a9b1gths/
[09:28:16] <matthias___> hello, i'm using http://www.fixedheadertable.com/ but i get not the expected results. my code: https://bpaste.net/show/37ddc0db2a63 http://www.fixedheadertable.com/
[09:28:39] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[09:30:30] <wheeei> Can I preventdefault and then call for a inputfield to focus?
[09:30:37] <robertmaxrees> sure
[09:31:35] <wheeei> would I just write event.blur(); or event.focus(); after event.preventDefault(); in the same function?
[09:31:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:31:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to select the element and run .trigger('focus') on it.
[09:32:23] <wheeei> ok, thanx a lot I think this will solve a annoying little bug Ive been working on all day
[09:35:03] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: okay: http://jsfiddle.net/r381pxnm/
[09:35:25] <robertmaxrees> matthias___ and your html is valid?
[09:35:52] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: displays fine without the jquery plugin
[09:36:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked :)
[09:36:35] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: how can i validate it? i tried serveral but the had issues with the html attributes
[09:36:44] <wheeei> gah same bug came back when I triggered it :(
[09:36:57] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: *several checkers
[09:37:05] <robertmaxrees> lol.
[09:39:04] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: sorry?
[09:39:16] <robertmaxrees> you just said that your code isn't valid.
[09:39:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd try fixing it and then going from there.
[09:40:31] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: i may not use uuid=""   instead data-uuid="" right?
[09:41:03] <robertmaxrees> you kind of can, but it's not valid.
[09:41:15] <robertmaxrees> though that's a tricky subject.
[09:41:50] <wheeei> about to lose my mind, I have been working on small bug all day. I just finished a mobile menu but when you focus the login-form input-field it triggers the mobile menus toggle somehow and collapses. At first I was sure that e.stopPropagation(); or event.stopImmediatePropagation() would solve the problem but it doesnt and nothing else I've tried either :(
[09:41:53] <matthias___> i will change them ...
[09:42:03] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ wheeei
[09:42:03] <b-ot> wheeei: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:43:09] <robertmaxrees> matthias___ also check to make sure you're satisfying the reqs for the plugin.  when in doubt, make a small, self-contained example.
[09:43:21] <robertmaxrees> instead of one with massive amounts of stuff, try a simplified version instead.
[09:43:24] <matthias___> okay thanks
[09:58:34] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: i have still no success: http://jsfiddle.net/r381pxnm/1/
[09:59:55] <robertmaxrees> so try to simplify and go from there.
[10:03:36] <wheeei> robertmaxrees cool if I just put up a small test-site instead of a fiddle? had problems getting the problem on the fiddle..
[10:03:54] <robertmaxrees> fiddles are preferred because then i can edit your code.
[10:04:30] <wheeei> I didnt get an issue on the fiddle, I think the fiddle website might fix it automatically
[10:04:39] <robertmaxrees> what was your issue again?
[10:06:11] <wheeei> I have implemented a reponsive menu but I got form inside of it, it works great on desktop (and all its mobile emulators) but on mobile devices the focus on the input-fields triggers the menu to collapse the first time it gets focused, after that it works great again. Its really weird and I cant get my head around it. Heres an demo of the issue http://webtherock.com/debug/
[10:07:14] <robertmaxrees> $('input').on('click', function(e) {});
[10:07:23] <robertmaxrees> then in the handler e.stopPropagation();
[10:08:05] <robertmaxrees> you might also need to catch the various touch events, too, depending on what the parent menu is looking for to collapse things.
[10:09:47] <wheeei> robertmaxrees I will try again what you wrote but I have tried e.stopPropagation(); on every possible way I can and all touch events I could think of and nothing have helped
[10:10:02] <wheeei> didnt work this time either
[10:11:07] <wheeei> this is the plugin Im using: https://github.com/MartinBlackburn/responsive-nav/blob/master/js/navigation.js
[10:11:12] <robertmaxrees> $('.nav').on('click touch touchstart', 'input', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[10:11:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the right code on your sample page currently.
[10:11:49] <robertmaxrees> your event listener needs to be on the input or a delegated listener for the input.
[10:11:53] <robertmaxrees> not on .navControl.
[10:11:56] <wheeei> I think u did it
[10:11:59] <wheeei> :O
[10:12:00] <wheeei> :O:O:O:O
[10:12:04] <robertmaxrees> you were bound to the wrong spot.
[10:12:43] <wheeei> I think that you added just "touch" made the difference, I never found that when searching for a solution
[10:12:49] <hellier> Hey, bit of an odd question here. Don't suppose anyone can throw me in a direction of some well written jQuery form validation, I can take a peak at. Not a lib, a real site.
[10:13:05] <robertmaxrees> wheeei the delegated listener may have fixed it.
[10:13:18] <robertmaxrees> hellier huh?
[10:13:34] <hellier> What are you having trouble with understanding?
[10:13:41] <robertmaxrees> why don't you want a lib?
[10:13:49] <robertmaxrees> just confused by why you're asking that.
[10:13:54] <hellier> I'm wanting ot check over some written source code
[10:14:16] <hellier> Decently written code that is. Just looking to see how my own code differs.
[10:14:23] <hellier> How it could be better, etc.
[10:14:41] <robertmaxrees> okay
[10:15:17] <wheeei> :( The problem remains :(:(:(
[10:15:46] <robertmaxrees> wheeei put a console.log() in that handler to make sure it's actually firing.
[10:15:56] <wheeei> I was just too excited and it hadnt reload, when the form have been focused once the bug dissapears... thats weird too
[10:16:18] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything like that?
[10:17:18] <wheeei> robertmaxrees it fired alright
[10:17:30] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 follow this then.
[10:17:34] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'm at a loss.
[10:17:39] <wheeei> tested it with an alert box
[10:17:46] <robertmaxrees> avoid using alerts fwiw.
[10:17:53] <robertmaxrees> but if that fired, hrm.
[10:18:27] <jessy-jo> so if i do var message = $('#message').val(); and then $message.val(''); why do i get undefined
[10:18:39] <jessy-jo> sorry message
[10:18:51] <robertmaxrees> because message is a string.
[10:18:51] <jessy-jo> message.val('');
[10:18:54] <robertmaxrees> not the jquery object.
[10:19:13] <hellier> message.val();
[10:19:20] <hellier> no dollar sign when you set the var
[10:19:34] <robertmaxrees> they already corrected themselves, but that's not the problem.
[10:19:36] <jessy-jo> yeah i misstyped
[10:19:53] <robertmaxrees> var message = $('#message').val(); is set to whatever .val() returned, which would be a string, not a jquery object.
[10:20:15] <robertmaxrees> so your second call is like you're trying to do  $('#message').val().val('');
[10:20:18] <jessy-jo> robertmaxrees: if then i want to set it to another val
[10:20:37] <robertmaxrees> you either reselect it or "cache" the jquery object instead.
[10:20:38] <jessy-jo> umm looks kinda horrible
[10:20:46] <robertmaxrees> var $message = $('#message');
[10:20:51] <jessy-jo> yeah
[10:20:54] <jessy-jo> definitely
[10:20:59] <jessy-jo> thanks robertmaxrees
[10:21:08] <robertmaxrees> then $message.val(); to read, $message.val(''); to set, etc.
[10:25:51] <wheeei> robertmaxrees created a jsbin with the same issue now!
[10:25:57] <wheeei> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/ruwagohaco/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:27:24] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[10:28:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/xeqozipuzo/1/edit?html,js,output works fine for me.
[10:29:24] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: i got it working now :)
[10:29:30] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  what was is?
[10:29:32] <robertmaxrees> *it
[10:30:19] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/r381pxnm/3/ there was simply some css missing. haha
[10:30:44] <matthias___> i haven't thought about it
[10:32:10] <wheeei> robertmaxrees u need to test on a mobile device and not a emulator. It works great on desktop and chrome dev tools emulators but not on chrom on my android S4 and other mobiles
[10:32:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm lazy and not going to do that fwiw.
[10:32:36] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[10:32:41] <wheeei> :(
[10:32:52] <robertmaxrees> check out the link i tossed you earlier.
[10:32:53] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: but there are some problems with events. normally i have a focus and blur event for the name column, which is editable. but for this column it is not working when i apply the fixedheadertable command. i read something about .clone() to set it .clone(true, true) but i'm not sure
[10:33:08] <wheeei> robertmaxrees the fiddle-link? I tried it on my android, didnt work
[10:33:33] <wheeei> the jsbin http://jsbin.com/xeqozipuzo/1/ didnt work
[10:33:39] <robertmaxrees> the fixingthesejquery.com link.
[10:34:22] <wheeei> ok
[10:34:58] <wheeei> robertmaxrees the weirdest thing about this is that once the bug happend once it never happens again unless you reload the page..
[10:41:09] <wheeei> robertmaxrees anything I can do, to make you take another look at it? :/ Im quite desperate :P
[10:42:26] <matthias___> *awk for ~1,5h
[10:53:03] <MikeD_> why does the .data() object force the property names to lower case?
[10:54:36] <robertmaxrees> unless you dasherize them, you mean? :)
[10:54:49] <MikeD_> ?
[10:55:35] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/mdfcb24b/
[10:55:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pwq1k7ea/
[10:57:44] <MikeD_> i wish i knew this kind of stuff before I wrote a ton of code :(
[10:58:20] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*
[10:58:23] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery limitation.
[10:58:30] <robertmaxrees> HTML5 limitation.
[10:59:10] <MikeD_> oh. damn.
[11:28:22] <forQuery> nice, i just wrote my first css4 stylesheet
[11:28:34] <islalobo> Hey, is there a way to pass a variable to onclick function? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d69d184a5c7fbce720f3
[11:28:40] <forQuery> complete with varibales and coloration functions
[11:28:41] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:28:51] <robertmaxrees> forQuery CSS is a livign spec now.  no "css4"
[11:28:58] <arthurvr> lol
[11:29:03] <forQuery> it was just released in march 2015
[11:29:25] <arthurvr> wut?
[11:29:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:29:40] <forQuery> well, they call all the moduless for it level 4
[11:29:44] <forQuery> ex: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#modifying-colors
[11:29:51] <robertmaxrees> there are some "level 4" specs, but no "css4"
[11:30:02] <forQuery> yes :) i didnt know
[11:30:05] <arthurvr> haha :D
[11:30:07] <forQuery> https://cssnext.github.io/ lets you use it starting today
[11:30:17] <robertmaxrees> islalobo sort of, but I'd avoid it if at all possible.
[11:30:18] <forQuery> just installed on my server with postcss, works great
[11:31:00] <arthurvr> forQuery: off-topic but you should avoid that kind of tech on your server.
[11:31:17] <forQuery> ut oh, can you share more?
[11:31:28] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: what are the reasons to avoid?
[11:31:48] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: can I run what I'm trying to achieve by you?
[11:32:04] <arthurvr> forQuery: You meant to run it on your css before serving a webpage right?
[11:32:08] <arthurvr> really bad idea.
[11:32:26] <forQuery> yea, it caches into .css file though
[11:32:37] <robertmaxrees> islalobo sure - toss it out into the channel.
[11:32:49] <forQuery> i g2g phone, client, sry
[11:32:53] <forQuery> you guys rock!
[11:37:31] <islalobo> Hey guys, I want to prepopulate some forms by passing a value in onclick function (or some other method). The structure of my page is like this: https://jsfiddle.net/o7c36k8t/  Basically, I want each 'edit' button to receive a value that will allow it to display a prepopulated form unique that that item
[11:38:30] <robertmaxrees> where's the input?
[11:39:17] <MikeD_> you know html has other tags besides div, right?  :P
[11:40:26] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: are you asking me? the value is being passed
[11:40:30] <robertmaxrees> islalobo i don't understand what your question has to do with that markup/js
[11:40:36] <islalobo> $adhMedicationAlertId
[11:40:52] <islalobo> using onclick function in a link
[11:41:00] <maxvi> is jQuery 2 load map automatically ? or I need to link it in html ?
[11:41:19] <robertmaxrees> islalobo huh?
[11:41:25] <robertmaxrees> are you sure this is the right markup?
[11:41:54] <robertmaxrees> btw href is only valid on <a> tags last i checked.
[11:42:04] <islalobo> for onclick?
[11:42:11] <robertmaxrees> for a tags.
[11:42:16] <robertmaxrees> <button href="#collapse1" class="btn button-white button-large edit-alerts">Edit</button> isn't valid.
[11:42:41] <robertmaxrees> either way, what are you expecting to happen if i click that button?
[11:43:42] <robertmaxrees> oh also <div class="edit-alerts-form" id="collapse1" style="display:none">PRINT FORM</div> - you have this ID replicated on the page.
[11:43:45] <robertmaxrees> that's a no-no.
[11:43:47] <islalobo> The only think I want to try to do is pass a value to the onclick function
[11:43:59] <robertmaxrees> to do what?
[11:44:08] <islalobo> so that the form that shows is relative to that specific item
[11:44:21] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaah the "PRINT FORM" div?
[11:44:26] <robertmaxrees> no need to pass anything.
[11:44:27] <islalobo> Yeah
[11:44:33] <robertmaxrees> first things first, fix the duplicate IDs.
[11:44:43] <islalobo> and sorry, I updated the id's in my code, but not jsfiddle
[11:44:43] <robertmaxrees> either make those classes, or get rid of them.
[11:44:50] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle then :)
[11:44:55] <islalobo> id="<?php print $value['adhMedicationAlertId']; ?>"
[11:44:59] <islalobo> Okay
[11:45:13] <islalobo> I just noticed :P
[11:47:06] <robertmaxrees> either way - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o7c36k8t/1/
[11:48:07] <MrSavage> For var $div = $("<div>", {id: "foo", class: "a"}); what does the $ infront of div signify?
[11:48:24] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/o7c36k8t/2/
[11:48:26] <robertmaxrees> it's a convention.
[11:48:38] <robertmaxrees> islalobo look at the fiddle i tossed out.
[11:48:45] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage that the object is a "jquery object"
[11:49:20] <islalobo> Okay, I can update that later, but what about trying to prepopulate based on that same id
[11:49:26] <NoiseEee> MrSavage: its a convention, which is there to 'hint' to developers that $div is a jquery object representing the <div>, and not just a DOM element
[11:49:42] <robertmaxrees> islalobo do what now?
[11:49:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to update the fiddle to illustrate what you're talking about.
[11:50:01] <robertmaxrees> because i don't see what you're prepopulating.
[11:50:34] <islalobo> onclick="getEditForm($adhMedicationAlertId)"
[11:50:39] <robertmaxrees> don't do that inline.
[11:50:51] <robertmaxrees> and that doesn't tell me anything.
[11:50:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to show me a more fleshed out example.
[11:54:34] <MikeD_> islalobo: try adding some comments to your example, it's amazing what you discover when you are forced to explain in words :)
[12:00:27] <forQuery> actually, the more tags you use the faster your jquery selectors will be
[12:00:30] <forQuery> assortment is speed
[12:00:35] <robertmaxrees> WHAT
[12:00:40] <forQuery> the more various tags i mean
[12:00:52] <forQuery> like if you use one figure and one section and one div it is faster than if you use 3 div
[12:01:08] <robertmaxrees> proof
[12:01:25] <MikeD_> proof would be so contrived it wouldn't be much proof
[12:01:28] <forQuery> no
[12:01:31] <forQuery> its not contrived
[12:01:33] <forQuery> there is proof
[12:01:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd love to see it.
[12:01:38] <forQuery> and ill prove the bitch!
[12:01:42] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:01:48] <robertmaxrees> not cool.
[12:03:02] <MikeD_> does .prop('checked',true) fire the change event?
[12:04:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z37hn8bp/ MikeD_
[12:04:10] <robertmaxrees> (nope)
[12:05:20] <MikeD_> so this then: http://jsfiddle.net/z37hn8bp/1/
[12:09:34] <xMopxShell> Is there a way to track exactly where an event was triggered if i‚Äôm catching it somewhere?
[12:09:46] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell not sure what you mean.
[12:10:10] <forQuery> sigh... i cant find the article.  im positive i read about it though.  It might be if you are using the tag selector only though, not id or class selectors
[12:10:18] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: For example, there‚Äôs $(window).trigger(‚Äòresize‚Äô) being called somewhere. I‚Äôm listening for resize events and want to see where it was triggered
[12:10:28] <xMopxShell> Just for debugging purposes
[12:10:33] <robertmaxrees> you can see the e.target
[12:10:41] <robertmaxrees> check out the event object in the event listener.
[12:10:52] <robertmaxrees> that'll tell you the element
[12:11:06] <forQuery> http://robertmaxrees.com/ you have good examples on your site robert :)
[12:11:12] <xMopxShell> Ah, i‚Äôm looking for where $(window).trigger(‚Äòresize‚Äô) is being executed
[12:11:18] <xMopxShell> not the element itself, that will always be window
[12:11:22] <robertmaxrees> forQuery hah, thanks.
[12:11:35] <robertmaxrees> i need to clean up that poole install and write more.
[12:11:41] <MrSavage> alright for some reason I'm getting null for a selecting a class in a document
[12:11:53] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell your dev tools can tell you what listeners are bound.
[12:11:58] <MrSavage> can I just type $(".search_controls"); in console?
[12:12:08] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: it‚Äôs not bound anywhere
[12:12:09] <MrSavage> or is it more elaborate to access the DOM?
[12:12:20] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage if jquery is loaded or you're using chrome, that should work.
[12:12:25] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell ah right, trigger.
[12:12:39] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: I think jquery is loaded. I see the script. I'm just using the console in firefox
[12:12:40] <xMopxShell> It doesn‚Äôt look like theres a way to track that down besides searching source code
[12:13:19] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage try doing $.fn.jquery
[12:13:21] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[12:13:38] <MrSavage> undefined
[12:13:40] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell i can't recall, but you'll likely have ot dump around the source.
[12:13:47] <xMopxShell> Alright fair enough
[12:13:49] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage now try jQuery.fn.jquery
[12:13:51] <xMopxShell> thanks
[12:13:51] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[12:14:05] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: shows 1.11.1
[12:14:11] <robertmaxrees> noConflict mode is turned on.
[12:14:15] <robertmaxrees> so instead of using $, use jQuery
[12:14:22] <MrSavage> huh
[12:14:35] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('.someClass');
[12:14:41] <MrSavage> can i change that?
[12:14:48] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[12:14:52] <robertmaxrees> if you own the site, sure :)
[12:15:04] <intropy> any advice on how to append dynamic elements
[12:15:17] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: I don't own the site, creating a userscript
[12:15:25] <MrSavage> i'm trying to make a userscript for steam
[12:15:46] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage then you'll have to wrap in a closure that'll reserve $ for you.  are you going to use a doc ready?
[12:16:00] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: After it finishes loading
[12:16:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:16:11] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: I'm new
[12:16:24] <MrSavage> what do you mean doc ready
[12:16:34] <maxvi> anybody know if jQuery load jquery.map automatically ?
[12:16:40] <intropy> any advice on how to add and remove elements dynamically
[12:16:52] <robertmaxrees> intropy use .append() and .remove() ?
[12:17:01] <robertmaxrees> maxvi $.map should be included, yes.
[12:17:08] <forQuery> or .detach i think, if you want to keep event listeners intact
[12:17:23] <robertmaxrees> use delegated listeners instead imo.
[12:17:42] <forQuery> i need to learn more of this still :) you taught me a lot yesterday
[12:17:45] <matthias___> robertmaxrees: okay, i'm back
[12:17:52] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vr55uhw6/ check this out.
[12:18:00] <robertmaxrees> if you put all your code where that comment is, you can use $ again
[12:18:08] <MrSavage> ty
[12:18:16] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: just what i needed, thank you
[12:18:20] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[12:18:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vr55uhw6/1/ shows the original and a document ready variant.
[12:19:09] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: Is it ok if I put .call(this) at the end? I'm using greasemonkey so
[12:19:22] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage for what?
[12:19:25] <MrSavage> not really sure what the (jQuery) at the end is doing
[12:19:35] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: so the userscript runs automatically
[12:19:43] <robertmaxrees> that will run automatically.
[12:19:48] <robertmaxrees> no need to .call() it.
[12:19:50] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: Oh, was copying another userscript
[12:19:51] <robertmaxrees> that's called an IIFE>
[12:20:12] <forQuery> pernounced iffy
[12:20:26] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ good article on the subject.
[12:22:41] <forQuery> yall suppose that's the real remysharp in the chat list
[12:22:54] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't be surprised.
[12:23:00] <forQuery> that guy is super famous developer
[12:23:01] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: also how do i properly debug my script? I notice greasemonkey is not making the script show up in debugger
[12:23:02] <robertmaxrees> paul irish used to hang out in here a lot.
[12:23:11] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage not sure i follow.
[12:23:19] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: You know greasemonkey?
[12:23:22] <forQuery> well that's another level of famous
[12:23:22] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[12:23:33] <robertmaxrees> forQuery a lot of those figures hang out in here.
[12:23:40] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
[12:23:44] <forQuery> too cool
[12:23:50] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage let me rephrase - i am aware of what it is.
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't have a working knowledge of it.
[12:24:01] <MrSavage> oh
[12:26:27] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: then what's the preferred way of running javascripts manually?
[12:26:40] <MrSavage> so i can debug it
[12:26:43] <robertmaxrees> greasemonkey is a popular choice.
[12:26:47] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "debug"?
[12:27:01] <forQuery> so i have a lynda.com account.  Anyone have a teamtreehouse or tutsplus account?  I was thinking we could trade login credentiuals and have 2x the access for 1/2 the price.
[12:27:06] <MrSavage> where i can set breakpoints and look at variables and see their values via the gui
[12:27:13] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3490279/923919 MrSavage
[12:27:24] <robertmaxrees> forQuery not the right place for that.
[12:27:40] <robertmaxrees> kind of a grey area thing to do ;)
[12:28:08] <forQuery> oh, ok
[12:28:09] <forQuery> sry
[12:28:27] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage google around for info.  there's also the console api that can help with debugging.
[12:30:05] <MrSavage> ah not sure why you would use firebug since firefox has it's own tools already
[12:30:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm using firefox's dev tools.
[12:30:23] <robertmaxrees> my larger point is "google around"
[12:31:22] <forQuery> ppl love firebug, it's oldest and i think folks get used to what they use
[12:31:33] <robertmaxrees> they're abandoning it.
[12:31:36] <robertmaxrees> for firebug.next
[12:31:46] <forQuery> ooh, cool, im going to check this out
[12:31:51] <robertmaxrees> which sits on top of the fire fox dev tools.  lots of people primarily use chrome.
[13:06:01] <MrSavage> I can't seem to find anything about this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10619445/the-prefered-way-of-creating-a-new-element-with-jquery
[13:06:08] <MrSavage> on the jquery api documentation
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> about which part?
[13:07:14] <robertmaxrees> if you're just trying to create a new element, go for whichever is easiest.  don't concern yourself with performance implications.
[13:07:37] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: well i'm just trying to learn the easiest way to create elements
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i tend to prefer var $newDiv = $('<div>', {'class': 'some-classes go-here'});
[13:08:05] <robertmaxrees> and then .append() when all is said and done.
[13:08:16] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: but i can't find documentation on that way
[13:08:44] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[13:08:52] <robertmaxrees> like about using $() to make elements?
[13:09:13] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:09:17] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[13:09:18] <MrSavage> i don't see anything on that kind of syntax
[13:09:32] <MrSavage> of course...it's not $...it's jQuery
[13:09:37] <MrSavage> thanks
[13:09:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:10:15] <acidjazz> what other characters can be used
[13:10:16] <acidjazz> like $ and _
[13:10:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:30] <hcker2000> any one know how to access .toDataURL when using $('canvas') selector?
[13:11:45] <robertmaxrees> is that an underlyng DOM method?
[13:11:52] <forQuery> $parent.find("#selectWidgetScale_UL").find("a")
[13:11:53] <hcker2000> yes
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> hcker2000 do $('canvas')[0].toDataURL
[13:12:10] <robertmaxrees> forQuery noooo
[13:12:10] <forQuery> assuming you only use #selectWidegetScale_UL once on page, is this fastest way to find this a element?
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:12:17] <forQuery> :)
[13:12:20] <hcker2000> robertmaxrees, let me give that a go
[13:12:24] <robertmaxrees> directly select it.
[13:12:35] <robertmaxrees> also: perf isn't kind.
[13:12:36] <forQuery>   $("#selectWidgetScale_UL").find("a") this is what im using right now...
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> *king
[13:13:01] <robertmaxrees> and that will be faster.  but don't overly concern yourself with performance.
[13:13:45] <hcker2000> robertmaxrees, thanks that did the trick. just curious is there a way to tell jquery you only want one node with a selector vs doing [0]
[13:14:09] <forQuery> i think doing [0] makes it native javascript selector not jquery selector
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> there's also .get(0)
[13:14:25] <robertmaxrees> doing [0] accesses the property named "0"
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> .get(0) returns it.
[13:14:40] <robertmaxrees> same object, two different ways to access it.
[13:14:49] <hcker2000> robertmaxrees, ok good to know perhaps you could help me with one more thing
[13:14:57] <hcker2000> I have just converted some code over to a plugin
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> the jquery object is "array-like", so you can use numeric indices against it to get the underlying DOM nodes.
[13:15:10] <hcker2000> as I need to use it various places
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> i ahve to leave soon, so what's up?
[13:15:54] <hcker2000> I'm wondering how could I do some thing like $('specific selector').myPlugin('getProperty');
[13:16:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:16:18] <hcker2000> right now once the plugin has run on multiple items I have no way to get the info from them
[13:16:24] <forQuery> im sorry to ask again, i just dont get it.... this is what I have  $("#element").find("a")  so if I already have $parent element cashed, is it not faster to do $(parent).find("#element").find(
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> hcker2000 you need to store that info somewhere.
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> forQuery it's not faster.

[13:17:17] <hcker2000> robertmaxrees, ok I'm thinking i would just use .data to store a reference to the function?
[13:17:23] <hcker2000> that i want to pull the data from
[13:17:40] <forQuery> sorry, just to verify...
[13:17:52] <forQuery>   $("#element").find("a") ...  so if I already have $parent element cashed, it is slower to do $parent.find("#element").find("a")
[13:17:59] <robertmaxrees> forQuery correct.
[13:18:02] <forQuery> :)
[13:18:04] <hcker2000> but I have seen other plugins like bootstrap do $('selector').modal('show');
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> hcker2000 right, that's running a function, not retrieving data.
[13:18:32] <robertmaxrees> forQuery read up about selector performance.
[13:18:39] <hcker2000> I'm not sure how to make my plugin accessable via .myPlugin
[13:18:46] <robertmaxrees> hcker2000 check out the plugin guide.
[13:18:51] <robertmaxrees> i gotta go to lunch.  sorry folks!
[13:18:53] <robertmaxrees> bbiab.
[13:18:57] <hcker2000> robertmaxrees, ill search it up
[13:20:44] <forQuery> so this is an image of a bunch of cached selectors, i use them multiple times in multiple methods within.    http://imgur.com/wj2iCXK
[13:20:46] <forQuery> I'm thinking, do I leave as is... or do i use find on them.
[13:21:16] <forQuery> i updated two to use find... it worked but...
[13:22:06] <forQuery> i dont know if it's better.  Down in children methods below, on the collection cached selectors list, i use .find() or .children
[13:39:04] <Es0teric> anyone here use fancybox?
[14:15:01] <RubyRonin> anyone have any experience parsing json data?
[14:27:39] <MikeD_> RubyRonin: JSON.parse( ) ?
[14:28:35] <sadtaco> How do I select elements that do not contain elements that have a certain class?
[14:29:36] <sadtaco> I guess .has can do it
[14:30:50] <NoiseEee> also .not()
[14:36:21] <forQuery>                             if ($("#searchLabels_allLabels_UL>li:not(.hide):not(.added)").length) {
[14:36:34] <forQuery> is there a better way to write this?
[14:38:46] <sadtaco> $('.container').find('.to-select:not(.bad-parent .to-select)');
[14:38:48] <sadtaco> Almost except.. Now I need the selection that is the first group of a parent.
[14:38:48] <sadtaco> I hope that make sense.
[14:38:53] <sadtaco> As in I have two containers, and two sets of .to-select that are not children of .bad-parent, and I only want to get the first selection of children that's matched
[14:39:03] <sadtaco> first selection of siblings
[14:39:03] <sadtaco> something like .filter(is not the sibling of the first element matched)
[14:39:07] <forQuery> .closest is quick... but for straight up :first...
[14:39:12] <forQuery> nothing is better than :first-of-type
[14:39:19] <forQuery> http://jamesallardice.com/selecting-the-first-element-with-jquery/
[14:39:37] <sadtaco> You should be able to :not(.hide.added) for starters
[14:41:12] <sadtaco> Anyway I figured it out. I just hit the first and and do .siblings().andSelf()
[15:01:27] <forQuery> cool i did not know andSelf()
[15:04:50] <jarco> Hello all. I am trying to append an element To a child of one of its parents. It is not a direct sibling to the element I want to append it to. I am trying to do this:    $(this).closest('.parent').find('uliwanttoappendto').append(this); But for some reason the element i want to append to dissapears now.
[15:07:19] <jarco> nvm my question. I did somthing stupid :)
[15:21:10] <noober03> i have this selector (($("input[name ^= 'work_order[" + names[i] + "'")) that can select multiple items. is there a way to get the values of all those items that are selected?
[15:22:02] <noober03> currently i use a each loop to get each of the values, but i wanted to see if there is an easier way to do this with the selector
[15:27:07] <MrSavage> What's the best way to go by if I wanted to retrieve innerHTML from a URL, then modify it, and implement it on the current page?
[15:27:20] <MrSavage> I'm not sure if I want to use $.get or $(...).load
[15:42:50] <MrSavage> how can i use a select after a selector?
[15:55:22] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage hrm?
[15:55:38] <MrSavage> i'm just having issues with ajax atm
[15:55:42] <MrSavage> What's the best way to go by if I wanted to retrieve innerHTML from a URL, then modify it, and implement it on the current page?
[15:55:46] <MrSavage> I'm not sure if I want to use $.get or $(...).load
[15:56:04] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.load() or just $.ajax()
[15:56:06] <MrSavage> so far I'm trying $.parseHTML
[15:56:10] <MrSavage> from $.get
[15:56:12] <robertmaxrees> i prefer the latter personally.
[15:56:16] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.get() for that.
[15:56:20] <MrSavage> why?
[15:57:03] <robertmaxrees> $.get() tends to be more for just data with a callback.  you should $.fn.load() is more contextually appropriate in this case.
[15:57:16] <robertmaxrees> or just get used to using $.ajax() since that's what they all use anyway.
[15:57:48] <MrSavage> but i want to modify and save the data
[15:57:54] <robertmaxrees> so use $.ajax()
[15:57:58] <MrSavage> alright
[15:58:21] <robertmaxrees> .done(function(thedata){ $(thedata).find('#someDiv'); });
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> on that $.ajax() call.
[15:59:13] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: why don't you use $.parseHTML?
[15:59:31] <robertmaxrees> are you just grabbing another page?
[15:59:37] <MrSavage> ah it's not html
[15:59:42] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need to parse it.
[16:00:00] <robertmaxrees> that part is done for you when you $() it.
[16:00:19] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: unless you use $.get right?
[16:00:35] <robertmaxrees> $.get() is te same way.
[16:00:39] <MrSavage> ah wait $.get and $.ajax returns the same thing
[16:00:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[16:00:45] <MrSavage> which i'm not sure what it is
[16:00:49] <robertmaxrees> html.
[16:00:53] <MrSavage> a jqHXR
[16:00:55] <robertmaxrees> but when you do $() around it, it's fine.
[16:01:05] <MrSavage> alright
[16:01:11] <MrSavage> so why would you use parseHTML then?
[16:01:55] <robertmaxrees> if you need a utility way to parse something into DOM nodes.
[16:02:08] <robertmaxrees> notice that it's DOM nodes, not a jQuery object.
[16:02:41] <MrSavage> ah
[16:06:30] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: it's giving me undefined
[16:06:39] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[16:06:47] <MrSavage> !paste
[16:06:47] <b-ot> MrSavage: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:11:41] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/3m1dnwrx/1/
[16:12:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.  is the $.ajax() call properly configured in your case?
[16:13:07] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: yes
[16:13:12] <MrSavage> but i was trying to make a test case
[16:13:24] <MrSavage> forgot to put window.location.href
[16:13:41] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of the data you're getting back?
[16:14:04] <MrSavage> How?
[16:14:35] <robertmaxrees> console.log(data);
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> that should output it to your console.
[16:15:20] <MrSavage> ok
[16:15:42] <robertmaxrees> and/or just try $('#someElement').load('http://someurl.com #someContainer');
[16:19:07] <MrSavage> unsure how to copy the output
[16:19:13] <MrSavage> as it's all interactive
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> try the .load() example i just shared.
[16:20:07] <MrSavage> arg that seems a bit complicated
[16:20:17] <robertmaxrees> it really isn't.
[16:20:25] <MrSavage> yeah i'm just tired lol
[16:20:30] <robertmaxrees> $('#someElement') is where you want stuff to show up.
[16:20:35] <RubyRonin> when utilizing jquery mobile is their a means to created a fixed elment that never moves. For example a sound player that remains visible and fucntional irrespective of however many pages the user clicks throuhg?
[16:20:38] <robertmaxrees> htt://someurl.com is the URL you want to hit.
[16:20:49] <robertmaxrees> #someContainer is an element on that ajax'd page you want to have show up.
[16:20:56] <MrSavage> yes that's true, but i'm just trying to use $(data).html() atm
[16:21:05] <MrSavage> which is giving undefined
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> what is data ?
[16:21:31] <MrSavage> from the ajax done
[16:21:50] <robertmaxrees> i gathered that - is is an entire page?
[16:21:51] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[16:22:34] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: basically my whole script https://jsfiddle.net/3m1dnwrx/2/
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees>         var game = $("#searchGameKey").value; isn't what you think it is.
[16:23:54] <robertmaxrees> WOAH.  don't do that in a for loop.
[16:24:19] <MrSavage> yeah
[16:24:59] <MrSavage> i'm just making a crappy script and hopefully make it more efficient once i understand what the hell i'm doing lol
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3m1dnwrx/3/
[16:25:56] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: the reason it's in a for loop is because I'm trying to retrieve html from a bunch of pages
[16:26:22] <robertmaxrees> start with just one for now.
[16:26:28] <MrSavage> mkay
[16:26:36] <robertmaxrees> for loops with async operations like that is always a really bad idea.
[16:26:54] <MrSavage> yeah i know
[16:30:49] <sadtaco> How do I do a .find('.class') but to not look too deep for the class, sort of like closest() but in reverse and getting siblings?
[16:31:17] <sadtaco> They're deeper than just .children() will find, but I dont' want it look so deep it gets children of what it's selecting that also have the class
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco erm...
[16:31:48] <MrSavage> .last()?
[16:31:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:32:01] <sadtaco> Don't see how last() would help
[16:32:06] <MrSavage> i'm tired
[16:32:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find a class, but not children of that class that share the class?
[16:32:23] <sadtaco> Yes exactly
[16:32:30] <sadtaco> find all of a class but not the children in taht class
[16:32:36] <sadtaco> oh I think I can :not('.class .class')
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to .find() and then .filter() those whose .parents() contain the class.
[16:32:46] <robertmaxrees> or you could do that, too.
[16:33:07] <sadtaco> my way is better :P  Probably slower though. dunno
[16:33:15] <robertmaxrees> it will be slower.
[16:33:17] <sadtaco> since it's matching a bunch of stuff twice
[16:33:34] <sadtaco> luckily this mustn't be blazin
[16:33:44] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor methods over selectors.
[16:34:33] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: so this is still giving me undefined https://jsfiddle.net/3m1dnwrx/4/
[16:34:35] <sadtaco> I tend to favor what appears more clear and implicit in the code on client stuff.
[16:34:47] <MrSavage> i'm trying to see if i'm getting valid HTML back but it says undefined
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco right - selectors generally aren't either of those for me.
[16:35:07] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage what if you just console.log(data) - what do you get then?
[16:35:15] <MrSavage> some valid object
[16:35:25] <robertmaxrees> but of what?
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> can you like screenshot your console or something?
[16:36:10] <MrSavage> sure
[16:36:55] <sadtaco> So you're getting an *object* not a *string*?
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up.
[16:37:16] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: https://i.imgur.com/7gxvvwO.png
[16:37:24] <sadtaco> cause it looks like you want data to be a string not object
[16:37:28] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:37:37] <robertmaxrees> wtf.
[16:37:40] <sadtaco> data[0]
[16:37:46] <sadtaco> also wait
[16:37:47] <sadtaco> ...
[16:37:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ start there.
[16:37:52] <robertmaxrees> this is fucked up though.
[16:37:54] <sadtaco> that's not a string in there anyway.
[16:38:04] <MrSavage> no you told me to do console.log(data)
[16:38:09] <MrSavage> errr
[16:38:12] <MrSavage> wait a sec...
[16:38:13] <sadtaco> right but...
[16:38:14] <robertmaxrees> right, but what you're getting back isn't what you want.
[16:38:17] <sadtaco> your ajax is not returning a string of html
[16:38:20] <MrSavage> nevermind
[16:38:23] <sadtaco> it's returning an object/array
[16:38:23] <MrSavage> hold a sec
[16:38:31] <sadtaco> OPEN N SHUT CASE ROBERT
[16:38:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.
[16:39:03] <sadtaco> your js is fine your problem is your back end is not returning a string of html
[16:39:03] <MrSavage> ok well i do get valid html now
[16:39:12] <robertmaxrees> O.o okay.
[16:39:14] <MrSavage> but i don't get why $(data).html() gives invalid
[16:39:22] <sadtaco> cuz it's probably still an object?
[16:39:23] <MrSavage> i used console.log($(data))
[16:39:23] <robertmaxrees> because data is an array.
[16:39:25] <sadtaco> and you need to data[0]
[16:39:39] <MrSavage> what?
[16:39:45] <robertmaxrees> just try it.
[16:39:48] <robertmaxrees> $(data[0]);
[16:39:58] <sadtaco> $(data[0]).html()
[16:40:14] <MrSavage> but console.log(data) returns perfectly fine data
[16:40:23] <MrSavage> i just messed up
[16:40:24] <sadtaco> ... i think your idea of perfectly fine is wrong
[16:40:31] <MrSavage> because i sent you the wrong thing
[16:40:32] <robertmaxrees> lol you're confused about what the data is.
[16:40:35] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:40:39] <robertmaxrees> then show us the right thing.
[16:40:40] <sadtaco> And you need to read up on JS different object types and stuff, and what string/object/array are
[16:41:11] <MrSavage> https://i.imgur.com/ivZPBOb.png
[16:41:21] <sadtaco> even if that data is right or whatever... i dunno it still looks weird. It looks like an array of elements instead of an array of strings or JUST a string
[16:41:28] <MrSavage> omg man read
[16:41:39] <MrSavage> i said i put console.log($(data));
[16:41:44] <MrSavage> not console.log(data)
[16:41:51] <MrSavage> which is what it is now
[16:42:06] <MrSavage> however alert($(data).html()) gives undefined
[16:42:25] <sadtaco> Er can you $() an entire page like that? With doctype and all? It seems like that's what you're tryin to do
[16:42:27] <robertmaxrees> because it's not parsing correctly since you're fetching the entire page.
[16:42:38] <robertmaxrees> try the .load() i suggested earlier.
[16:42:42] <sadtaco> ^
[16:42:56] <MrSavage> alright
[16:42:59] <robertmaxrees> it's built to handle these cases.
[16:46:18] <MrSavage> can you load with a full http URL like: https://google.com/?search=asdf
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:46:37] <robertmaxrees> it's designed to handle this kind of case.
[16:47:11] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: alright so the load erased my page
[16:47:20] <MrSavage> well everything inside the element
[16:47:27] <MrSavage> the inner html i mean
[16:47:30] <robertmaxrees> and didn't load anything new?
[16:47:56] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: no
[16:48:31] <robertmaxrees> and your selector is all good?  be aware that some stuff probably isn't showing since it's probably generated via JS.
[16:49:13] <MrSavage> yeah my selector is good
[16:49:20] <MrSavage> it deleted all the innerhtml
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> the other selector.
[16:49:37] <robertmaxrees> for the content in the page you're fetching.
[16:49:37] <MrSavage> it's the same one that i'm loading
[16:49:55] <robertmaxrees> then something is generated via js.
[16:49:56] <MrSavage> yes
[16:50:03] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess.
[16:50:04] <MrSavage> i'll give you my testcase
[16:50:14] <MrSavage> https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Itfeelslikesomethingsintheair#members/?p=1
[16:50:19] <MrSavage> $("#memberList").load("https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Itfeelslikesomethingsintheair#members/?p=2 #memberList");
[16:50:26] <MrSavage> as simple as it gets
[16:50:39] <sadtaco> Whats with the selector in .load()
[16:50:45] <robertmaxrees> that's valid.
[16:50:51] <robertmaxrees> you use that to select something in the page to load in/
[16:50:53] <sadtaco> oh
[16:51:16] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage yeah, i was right.
[16:51:20] <robertmaxrees> this is all client-side, JS driven.
[16:51:36] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: but i can see the member list and all that via javascript with get
[16:51:39] <MrSavage> GET*
[16:51:57] <robertmaxrees> but you don't see the correct one.
[16:51:59] <MrSavage> i would read the data via $.get and i could see it fine
[16:52:13] <MrSavage> i don't understand
[16:52:26] <robertmaxrees> the javascript isn't executing when you load this content with ajax.
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> so the client-side stuff that needs to fire isn't.
[16:52:49] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess at least.
[16:53:04] <MrSavage> ok, but why does $.get work?
[16:53:07] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't.
[16:53:11] <MrSavage> yes it does
[16:53:13] <robertmaxrees> it's grabbing the first page of results.
[16:53:17] <robertmaxrees> not the subsequent pages.
[16:53:24] <MrSavage> let me show you a testcase
[16:53:29] <robertmaxrees> see how there's #members/?p=1 ?
[16:53:33] <robertmaxrees> on the end of that URL?
[16:54:41] <robertmaxrees> anything after the # doesn't get sent to the server - that's only read by the JS in the page.
[16:54:43] <MrSavage> ah...
[16:54:46] <MrSavage> yeah you're right lol
[16:54:52] <robertmaxrees> so that request never reaches the server, etc.
[16:55:14] <robertmaxrees> so let's take a big ol' step back - what are you trying to build?
[16:55:26] <MrSavage> just a filter for steam's crappy group browser
[16:55:37] <MrSavage> so you can filter the group by what games the members are playing
[16:55:44] <MrSavage> and then I can hopefully add "Join" buttons
[16:55:57] <MrSavage> i was searching the web for something like this and it doesn't exist so i thought I could make it
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, then you'll need to check out what the underlying ajax stuff they're doing is and go from there.
[16:56:13] <robertmaxrees> you have their source so it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
[16:56:19] <MrSavage> yeah luckily it isn't minified
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> even if it was you could unminify it.
[16:56:48] <MrSavage> yeah but the variable names throw me off
[16:56:52] <MrSavage> the handles
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> there are tools out there to make that a lot easier.
[16:57:21] <MrSavage> you mean where it makes every handle name like a, b, c, d, e?
[16:57:28] <robertmaxrees> "handle"?
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean variable ?
[16:57:36] <MrSavage> names for functions, variables
[16:57:44] <robertmaxrees> those are just variables.  not handles.
[16:57:47] <MrSavage> anything for the programmer to access and reference
[16:57:54] <MrSavage> a function isn't a variable
[16:57:57] <robertmaxrees> actually, it is.
[16:58:01] <robertmaxrees> functions in JS are objects.
[16:58:03] <robertmaxrees> like everything else.
[16:58:11] <MrSavage> well a handle is a name for something
[16:58:20] <robertmaxrees> in javascript, we call them "Variables".
[16:58:27] <MrSavage> so you can "handle" it
[16:58:30] <robertmaxrees> variables can be arrays, strings, functions, etc.
[16:58:37] <robertmaxrees> but we don't call them "handles"
[16:58:52] <MrSavage> that's being specific
[16:59:01] <robertmaxrees> that's being generic to the language.
[16:59:05] <robertmaxrees> we don't call them handles in JS.
[17:02:08] <Taggnostr> if I have a <pre> with several lines, what would be the easiest way to add line numbers at the beginning of each line?
[17:02:23] <robertmaxrees> use a <ul> instead.
[17:02:37] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to do some gymnastics with regex to handle it.
[17:04:25] <Taggnostr> robertmaxrees, that's what I'm trying to do
[17:05:50] <Taggnostr> $('pre.numbered').html().replace(/^/mg, '00') this adds '00' at the beginning of each line
[17:06:22] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: I just found my problem
[17:06:22] <robertmaxrees> or maybe something like var allLines = $('pre').html().split(/\r\n/g); var $newUl = $('<ul>'); allLines.forEach(function(currentLine) { $newUl.append('<li>' + currentLine + '</li>') });
[17:06:42] <robertmaxrees> or use ^ instead of \r\n in there.
[17:06:42] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: it's because i have to send a login cookie or whatever
[17:06:54] <robertmaxrees> MrSavage that's not the entire issue...
[17:07:02] <MrSavage> robertmaxrees: the page doesn't load if you try to get without login information i'm sure
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> except you're already authenticated.
[17:07:19] <robertmaxrees> that inforamtion was already sent.
[17:07:32] <robertmaxrees> it's because the JS isn't executing, so the content you need doesn't exist.
[17:07:47] <MrSavage> ah
[17:07:53] <MrSavage> nevermind
[17:08:22] <robertmaxrees> not sure how else to phrase that.  you need to abuse their current ajax setup.
[17:11:01] <sadtaco> Hm...
[17:12:10] <nardev> guys i want to switch from tabs to accordion responsively to resolution, however, .tabs have ajax load by default and i don't see something similar for accordion, is there any easy work around ?
[17:13:10] <sadtaco> I have something like <div class="container"><div class="to-match"><div class="container"><div class="to-match"></div></div></div><div class="to-match"></div></div>  So I have the outter .container selected. This is a tree, obviously. How can select the to-match that aren't within a .container OTHER THAN the current element I'm traversing from, if that makes sense?
[17:13:41] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco do you have any control over this html?
[17:13:41] <sadtaco> Like find('.to-match:not(.container .to-match)') will match nothing since the element i'm selecting from is .container
[17:13:59] <sadtaco> Yeah I do but.. I'm trying to make it really uh
[17:14:11] <robertmaxrees> this is a really bad structure so far.
[17:14:32] <sadtaco> I don't want certain html to lead to bad traversing of it.
[17:14:43] <sadtaco> Like yeah I could rename the inner container classes or something.
[17:14:46] <robertmaxrees> this is leading to bad traversal techniques.
[17:14:50] <sadtaco> But I want infinite depth to it.
[17:14:54] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:15:06] <sadtaco> This tree can just go deeper and deeper.
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a nightmare.
[17:15:24] <robertmaxrees> any way you could use classes that hint at the current depth or anything like that?
[17:15:26] <sadtaco> Heh it's a really complicated application
[17:16:04] <sadtaco> I absolutely could it's just I worry about others with plugins or whatever making mistakes with that. Ideally the traverse should handle not looking into another "container'
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> "other with plugins"?
[17:16:27] <sadtaco> It's bad code in one place to make code better everywhere else.
[17:16:30] <robertmaxrees> worry about your own sanity.
[17:17:06] <sadtaco> I really need it to traverse this way.
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll want to start using .filter(), parents(), and .length
[17:17:29] <sadtaco> I was thinking something with .closest() can see if it's inside something and stuff..
[17:17:32] <sadtaco> or uh
[17:17:44] <sadtaco> closest to compare .container in the not with the one it's searching from
[17:17:47] <robertmaxrees> what you need to know is how far deep you currently are in the tree.
[17:17:55] <sadtaco> Yeah
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> and then get rid of anything that's any deeper than that.
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> instead of dicking around with .closest()
[17:18:30] <sadtaco> Really all I need to do is throw out results that are in a .container that's not the .container it's traversing from
[17:18:39] <sadtaco> The start of the search I'm doing is one of those .container
[17:18:42] <robertmaxrees> right, so use .parents(), .filter() and .length
[17:19:25] <sadtaco> There's some extra html in there though. Like .to-match can be wrapped by another element.  It's just that element needs to not be .container that isn't the one that traverse is starting at
[17:19:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:19:48] <robertmaxrees> so you'd check .parents('.container').length
[17:20:05] <sadtaco> ah
[17:20:25] <nardev> guys i want to switch from tabs to accordion responsively to resolution, however, .tabs have ajax load by default and i don't see something similar for accordion, is there any easy work around ?
[17:20:26] <sadtaco> I need to use an .each() for that, though
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco nope.
[17:20:33] <robertmaxrees> then filter out anything oyu want whose .parents('.container').length is > what you have.
[17:20:38] <robertmaxrees> just try it.
[17:20:54] <sadtaco> if I select a bunch of .to-match and get .parents('.container').length it's just going to return one value.
[17:20:57] <sadtaco> I have to .each to get the value for each
[17:21:10] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco you're starting at a .container though
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to .find('.to-match').filter() at that point.
[17:21:57] <sadtaco> how do i filter then to take out the ones that don't have the same parent container length?
[17:22:30] <Taggnostr> http://jsfiddle.net/wto6cycg/ <- this seems to work
[17:22:36] <robertmaxrees> return $(this).closest('.container').length > parentContainerLength
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> or whatever
[17:23:08] <robertmaxrees> Taggnostr cool.  i still woulda use a UL, but whatever works :)
[17:23:37] <Taggnostr> robertmaxrees, I'm going to use a span for the line number, so I can format it more easily
[17:23:48] <sadtaco> Ohh filter can take a function
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> you should use ULs and css do to that Taggnostr :)
[17:23:54] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco yep.
[17:24:04] <robertmaxrees> .filter() is one of my favorite things.
[17:24:21] <Taggnostr> robertmaxrees, can I put e.g. a border-right on the number of an ul?
[17:25:09] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to, bvut fair enough.
[17:26:47] <sadtaco> That works great.
[17:26:55] <robertmaxrees> glad to hear :)
[17:27:26] <sadtaco> it's === parentContainerLength and .parents('.container') but yeah. The idea of it works.
[17:27:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah you get the idea.
[17:27:43] <sadtaco> Thankfully
[17:27:56] <robertmaxrees> somebody just needed to point you in the right direction :D
[17:27:58] <forQuery> does anyone know, is $.each faster than for(var i in object) { }
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> ew for loops.
[17:28:15] <forQuery> lol
[17:28:18] <robertmaxrees> and don't worry about performance
[17:28:18] <forQuery> well that answers that
[17:28:29] <forQuery> i can move anyting in a for in looop into each right?
[17:28:39] <sadtaco> Mhm
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> sorta, but why are you enumerating over object properties?
[17:30:43] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10070851
[17:31:00] <forQuery> so, here are two for-in loops i was using. For these, i think they can rewrite with each?
[17:31:10] <forQuery> $.each()
[17:31:12] <robertmaxrees> what is aLayout.area_order ?
[17:32:37] <Taggnostr> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/wto6cycg/1/
[17:33:07] <forQuery> one sec
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> Taggnostr http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wto6cycg/2/
[17:35:38] <Taggnostr> robertmaxrees, is $this a naming convention to indicate jquery objects?
[17:35:46] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:38:11] <forQuery> when i log type of, and also when i log aLayout.area_order i would get http://imgur.com/b32wiWK
[17:38:18] <forQuery> in this example, there are four containers on the page
[17:38:22] <robertmaxrees> that's an array.
[17:38:24] <robertmaxrees> not an object.
[17:38:35] <robertmaxrees> typeof what you think it is fwiw.
[17:38:52] <robertmaxrees> aLayout.area_order.forEach()
[17:38:57] <Taggnostr> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/wto6cycg/3/ this looks ok, thanks for the review!
[17:38:58] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> Taggnostr definitely :)
[17:40:52] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10070947  so, you would recommend top way, not bottom way?
[17:41:04] <robertmaxrees> that's nbot how you use forEach()
[17:41:12] <forQuery> yes
[17:41:14] <robertmaxrees> but for in loops are a bad idea to begin with.
[17:41:21] <robertmaxrees> and for in is wrong for arrays.
[17:42:08] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/805t93mz/
[17:42:53] <forQuery> sweeeet
[17:44:07] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[17:46:08] <forQuery> im doing my best to understand... http://jsfiddle.net/805t93mz/2/  but, im unsure what goes into that function part
[17:47:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see examples of the data, but probably something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/805t93mz/3/
[17:47:36] <Taggnostr> http://jsfiddle.net/wto6cycg/4/ one more tweak -- now the numbers are not selectable
[17:48:04] <forQuery> robert thank you
[17:48:09] <forQuery> just what i needed to understand
[17:48:27] <robertmaxrees> though your data is kind of oddly structured, but that should get you on your way.
[17:51:00] <forQuery> yea, learning and refactoring as I go
[17:51:23] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to reach accross objects like that.
[17:52:25] <robertmaxrees> either way, good luck.
[17:52:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm out.
[17:52:38] <forQuery> thx dude ttyl
[18:01:26] <kiki_lamb> What's the correct syntax to unbind this handler? $('tbody').on("click", 'a.remove-row', the_handler)
[18:01:26] <rcyr> Same thing but with .off
[18:02:36] <kiki_lamb> thank

[18:26:23] <[MOePP]Amethist> hi
[18:26:34] <[MOePP]Amethist> what is difference between jquery and javascript?
[18:26:40] <[MOePP]Amethist> both are not java?
[18:26:54] <Woet> one is a language and the other is a library for that language
[18:27:06] <Woet> and indeed, neither has anything to do with java.
[18:27:31] <[MOePP]Amethist> lol
[18:27:47] <[MOePP]Amethist> javascript is library right?
[18:28:13] <Woet> no.
[18:31:45] <rcyr> JavaScript is a language. jQuery is a DOM abstraction layer written in JavaScript.
[18:32:14] <[MOePP]Amethist> rcyr:  +1 and thanks
[18:32:35] <[MOePP]Amethist> after learn basic html , css and php
[18:32:56] <[MOePP]Amethist> i woke that have to know javascript :(
[18:41:17] <yellow1> Possible to have two $.post() methods with the same url? ex: $.post('/', etc)....
[18:42:23] <rcyr> The question doesn't make sense, can you explain better?
[18:43:59] <yellow1> rcyr: can two $.post() methods point to the same endpoint? example w/ express: app.post('/', etc) = endpoint
[18:44:23] <rcyr> Is that an express question or a jQuery question?
[18:44:39] <rcyr> But no, you cannot have multiple routes with the same path
[18:44:47] <rcyr> (For a specific verb)
[18:45:26] <yellow1> rcyr: why would that be? makes no sense
[18:46:43] <rcyr> I don't get what's difficult to understand... you cannot have 2 handlers for the same route + verb.
[18:46:49] <rcyr> Or else, which one would be picked?
[18:47:12] <rcyr> Again, is that a express or jquery question?
[19:03:08] <yellow1> rcyr: its a boss question
[19:06:09] <rcyr> I see
[19:20:53] <MrSavage> robbyoconnor: I figured it out
[19:21:06] <MrSavage> now should i use $.get, load, or ajax?
[19:29:44] <sadtaco> read the api pages, man. They tell you what those functions do.
[19:30:58] <jiggatrigga> do you guys know of a scroll plugin, that operates off of the z index? like a 3d depth scroller?
[19:31:29] <sadtaco> you mean parralax scroll?
[19:31:40] <sadtaco> The browser only has 2 scroll bars. x and y
[19:31:41] <yellow1> scroller9000.io
[19:32:11] <jiggatrigga> yeah well im considering a z scroller. do u know what i mean?
[19:32:40] <sadtaco> I don't
[19:33:52] <jiggatrigga> ok. consider a box....and consider another box behind it...a z index scroller would provide depth...like an itunes scroller for album flow, but not side to side, but from a z perspective
[19:34:47] <sadtaco> k go ahead and make it. Have fun.
[19:35:39] <jiggatrigga> do you know what im talking about now or are you still lost?
[19:38:50] <jiggatrigga> join #photoshop
[19:57:54] <jiggatrigga> hello is anyone there
[19:58:15] <Velveeta> sort of
[19:58:24] <Velveeta> what's up
[19:59:12] <jiggatrigga> ok this is bizarre...why in the world would my internet allow this connection to work, but when i try and open a tab, pull up any page...nothing... acts is if though disconnected
[19:59:13] <jiggatrigga> skype, and irc, still functional
[20:00:10] <Velveeta> sounds like a dns failure...
[20:00:30] <Velveeta> sometimes things your dns cache has already identified, it'll maintain services to, but any new lookups, like surfing the web, will fail
[20:01:24] <jiggatrigga> that sounds right how could I fix that? or what could be causing that
[20:02:52] <Velveeta> i would try first checking what your dns server is set to, and pinging it to make sure you're getting a response from it
[20:03:01] <Velveeta> if you are, then i'm not sure why'd you be having lookup failures
[20:13:06] <jiggatrigga> someone just told me to set my dns to 8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8
[20:13:22] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me why '.step2' class doesn't wait to slideDown? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WbWYGg
[20:13:38] <rcyr> jiggatrigga: That's google's dns servers
[20:14:10] <MrSavage> I'm having trouble trying to selecting elements that contain strings within them. I also notice that when I read the html(), that it's the entire document from the get
[20:17:40] <MrSavage> https://jsfiddle.net/rn59j4wd/
[20:24:04] <TeddyMurray> hi, im having trouble using jquery mobile with a background-image on the body element
[20:24:36] <TeddyMurray> i think it is because it adds ui-mobile to my html class
[20:24:50] <TeddyMurray> is that necessary or could i move it do a div?
[20:27:00] <MrSavage> ah nevermind
[21:08:37] <_1_Lak> hi
[21:16:44] <MrSavage> hi
[21:56:58] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me why '.step2' class doesn't wait to slideDown? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WbWYGg
[21:57:26] <d3m0n> Ignore the next/prev buttons and click the div

[23:20:22] <forQuery> so i tracked down the slowest function in my program.  I think it is because, it is doing keyword search layout thrashing and appending an li to a ul inside a foreach loop.
[23:20:46] <forQuery> can anyone guide me on how I would attach this to the parentUL one time, at end of foreach loop?  http://pastie.org/10071188
[23:27:47] <arthurvr> forQuery: You mean like just appending it?
[23:28:00] <forQuery> like yea
[23:28:03] <arthurvr> !api append @ forQuery
[23:28:03] <b-ot> forQuery: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[23:28:03] <forQuery> at end instead of everytime
[23:28:15] <arthurvr> just include an .append() in there
[23:54:09] <forQuery> so i was trying to use the documentfragment method to append content to a page, but im getting error message Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.
[23:54:24] <forQuery>  http://pastie.org/10071218 i made pastie
[23:54:34] <forQuery> maybe, if anyone knows how to use document fragment, they can help
[23:55:00] <forQuery> of if not, another idea
[23:55:04] <forQuery> i was using append to inside
[23:55:11] <forQuery> i was hoping to append at end of foreach
[23:55:14] <forQuery> not inside of foreach
