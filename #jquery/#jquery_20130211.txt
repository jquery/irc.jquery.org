[00:00:02] <dblosevn> assuming you have the $.cookie plugin
[00:01:11] <dblosevn> then in the load function do something like var oldDate = new Date($.cookie('firstopen'));
[00:01:19] <dblosevn> then just diff now to oldDate
[00:01:25] <dblosevn> pass that into init
[00:13:48] <nesoi> Hm... I'm getting rather frustrated. I can't seem to figure out why things aren't working. and furthermore none of the ways I've found online for determining which is the current page is working
[00:14:48] <ravenzz> what's the issue nesoi?
[00:18:18] <nesoi> ravenzz : I'm trying to create some buttons on a pagechange event
[00:18:28] <nesoi> I do the append, but they don't appear in the dom
[00:19:21] <nesoi> been trying to figure out why for like 3 or 4 hours
[00:19:46] <nesoi> and it's obviously something stupid
[00:21:22] <xdjuj> nesoi I don't understand
[00:21:30] <nesoi> so here https://gist.github.com/rlad/2e314063dc6d3a3f85e7
[00:21:36] <xdjuj> If your page change... Why do you want to create it with jQuery ?
[00:22:05] <nesoi> if I return from selecting contacts to a message creation page, I want to display the selected contacts as buttons
[00:22:33] <nesoi> so I'm binding to the pagechange event and checking to see if the new page is the message page and if we have selected some recipients
[00:23:02] <nesoi> so that code works to this extent: the two append and trigger statements which are full left indented work
[00:23:08] <nesoi> the console log shows what's expected
[00:23:24] <nesoi> the two append and trigger at the bottom do nothing
[00:23:32] <nesoi> it's obviously something really stupid but I can't find it
[00:23:55] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/pPKX2/
[00:23:57] <dblosevn> :-)
[00:24:12] <dblosevn> wait a few secs then click run again
[00:24:21] <nesoi> oh wait
[00:25:04] <dblosevn> nesoi: i figured your problem out most likely earlier
[00:25:12] <nesoi> you did dblosevn?
[00:25:14] <dblosevn> but you hauled ass before i could ask you something
[00:25:25] <dblosevn> what version of jquery you using?
[00:25:56] <nesoi> 1.2.0, but I also have jquery-migrate-1.1.0 loaded
[00:26:11] <dblosevn> oh ok, id still get rid of that delegate
[00:26:47] <dblosevn> i had a bitch of a time working on some code yesterday using jquery latest and delegate even with migrate
[00:26:57] <dblosevn> rewrite that to use .on instead
[00:27:57] <nesoi> I did
[00:27:58] <nesoi> :)
[00:28:12] <dblosevn> did it work?
[00:28:14] <nesoi> sorta
[00:28:16] <nesoi> no I have bind now
[00:28:18] <nesoi> no
[00:28:26] <dblosevn> .on is what you should use
[00:28:57] <fRAiLtY-> dblosevn:  N1!!!
[00:29:06] <dblosevn> .on is like bind and delegate on steroids :-)
[00:29:07] <nesoi> dblosevn : how do you know what page you're on in .on?
[00:29:12] <fRAiLtY-> Can I adjust the start number easily, just so it looks like a bit more random?
[00:29:24] <fRAiLtY-> Tried adjusting the static numbers but still starts from 0
[00:29:38] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: your as bad as a client it does what you asked
[00:29:53] <fRAiLtY-> :)
[00:29:57] <dblosevn> counts up from first page load
[00:30:21] <dblosevn> the plugin already supported it
[00:30:35] <nesoi> ah now it worked
[00:30:36] <dblosevn> sort of you just had to pass in a date object
[00:30:38] <nesoi> fuck that was dum
[00:30:59] <dblosevn> so i serialized the date object to a cookie on first load
[00:31:07] <nesoi> dblosevn : in delegate you can specify what page you want to trigger. how do you do it in .on?
[00:31:16] <dblosevn> un comment that line at the bottom and it will reset the coookie
[00:31:40] <dblosevn> ('#page-id').on
[00:32:07] <dblosevn> =^$
[00:33:07] <dblosevn> .on is cool because you can choose the parent to buble up to
[00:33:15] <dblosevn> delegate always used window
[00:33:41] <dblosevn> so if you had a complex dom it might have to bubble up 100 times
[00:33:47] <dblosevn> or more
[00:35:15] <nesoi> hmm... ok
[00:35:23] <dblosevn> the arg order is backwards in .on though
[00:35:34] <dblosevn> so make sure to switch it
[00:36:20] <nesoi> is bind deprecated ?
[00:36:28] <dblosevn> so like $('#page-id').on('event', '#target', function () { //callback
[00:36:34] <dblosevn> ya a few versions back
[00:36:42] <dblosevn> but bind doesnt deleagte anyways
[00:37:55] <dblosevn> they actually removed deleagte lol bind has still kinda stuck around
[00:38:16] <dblosevn> wow delegate my fingers are freezing
[00:38:21] <nesoi> dblosevn : I just did this $(document).bind('pagechange', function(event) { if ($.mobile.activePage[0].id == "message-page") {
[00:38:30] <nesoi> which is maybe not so nice
[00:39:10] <dblosevn> maybe were talking about 2 different issues
[00:39:23] <dblosevn> thats nothing like what you were stuck on earlier something about buttons
[00:39:36] <nesoi> I'm creating the buttons after that if
[00:39:48] <nesoi> I was looking for a good time to create them
[00:41:19] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: also keep in mind i didnt set an expiration date on that cookie so it will start over if the broswer is closed
[00:41:33] <dblosevn> easiy enough to set though
[00:42:05] <fRAiLtY-> dblosevn:  How?
[00:42:10] <fRAiLtY-> Just found that out btw :D
[00:43:51] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: $.cookie('lastload', now.toString(), 60*60*24*365);
[00:43:56] <dblosevn> would make it last a year
[00:44:13] <jamesdotnet> nesoi: You got the buttons working?
[00:44:50] <nesoi> jamesdotnet : yes, finally!
[00:44:52] <nesoi> eeeek!
[00:45:08] <faaat> How do make the cursor keep blinking when it has finished writing the text. the cursor goes away when its done, but i want to keep blinking. please help http://jsfiddle.net/Q6E2c/50/
[00:45:49] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/pPKX2/1/ there thats with expires in a year
[00:46:08] <serdem> hi guys, what is wrogn with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/sMByu/19/
[00:46:19] <serdem> i can not catch the click event on checkbox
[00:46:28] <fRAiLtY-> Thanks dblosevn
[00:46:42] <faaat> help pls
[00:47:44] <jamesdotnet> nesoi: Ok I was digging around trying to figure out how JQM buttons work, then noticed your snippet was missing a closing quote in id="b-' + contactsForMessage[k].id +'>'
[00:47:49] <jamesdotnet> thought that might be it
[00:48:18] <nesoi> jamesdotnet : yes it was and I am an idiot :)
[00:48:44] <nesoi> thanks jamesdotnet
[00:49:15] <jamesdotnet> nesoi: Hey it got me reading about something I've been putting off, so thanks for being an idiot. haha
[00:49:35] <nesoi> ah you're welcome!
[00:52:55] <dblosevn> faaat: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6E2c/51/
[00:53:55] <faaat> dblosevn: the curson disappears every second and comes back. do u see?
[00:54:22] <dblosevn> um dude you said blink and last i checked thats what blink was...
[00:54:41] <nesoi> hmm... how do I clear a text input field?
[00:54:49] <dblosevn> disappears and comes back === blink
[00:55:00] <dblosevn> some peoples kids
[00:55:04] <AdamPDotty> text.val('');
[00:55:20] <nesoi> AdamPDotty : I tried that but somehow it wasn't cleared.
[00:55:36] <dblosevn> text would have to be a jq object for that
[00:55:42] <nesoi> it is
[00:55:49] <nesoi> $('#contactsSelect').val('');
[00:55:49] <dblosevn> $(selector).val('')
[00:55:57] <nesoi> didn't clear it
[00:56:12] <nesoi> do I have to do something to redisplay it?
[00:56:13] <AdamPDotty> it only clears the first matching element though
[00:56:16] <dblosevn> ya only reason it wouldnt be cleared is if theres another field with that id on the page or another page loaded before it
[00:56:46] <nesoi> hm. there's no other element with that id, but there is another page loaded at the time. it's jqm though and the pages are in the same dom so I didn't think it mattered
[00:56:50] <dblosevn> jqm loads all pages into the dom and naviagting to another page does not remove the last one
[00:57:14] <nesoi> right, so that should work
[00:57:15] <nesoi> hmm
[00:57:33] <dblosevn> so if you have an id collission on another "page" you will get undesired results
[00:57:40] <nesoi> oh right
[00:57:43] <nesoi> I'm still an idiot
[00:57:50] <dblosevn> ++ nesoi
[00:58:11] <nesoi> I just don't know how to expect things should work
[00:58:18] <nesoi> so if they don't work I think I am not doing the right magic :)

[01:34:23] <wathek> any idea how can I trigger the change event on a select element just after I trigger the change event on an other select element ?
[01:35:03] <Cork> $('this_select_selector').trigger('change')
[01:35:30] <wathek> Cork, yes but I have two trigger('change')
[01:35:55] <wathek> Cork, I have  $("#id_opt_marque_popup").trigger('change'); $("#id_opt_modele_popup").trigger('change');
[01:36:11] <wathek> Cork, and the second trigger I want it to be triggered after the first one
[01:36:34] <Cork> wathek: that should happen by default
[01:36:40] <wathek> Cork, unfortunalty not
[01:37:17] <Cork> wathek: the your doing something else somewhere
[01:37:26] <Cork> events is fired in the order you queue them
[01:37:35] <wathek> hmm ok

[02:03:30] <Kingsy> I have some js running on a page. when you click an element it does *something* is it possible with firebug to find out exactly what code has been assigned to the event? when it runs etc?
[02:03:45] <Kingsy> I cant see the event in the library at all
[02:05:59] <Nancy2012> i have a problem in ajax  response which always return data valúes..  http://pastebin.com/vMpS49uc
[02:06:22] <dblosevn> Kingsy: theres this brand new thing they just invented called a call stack maybe that could help :-)
[02:07:25] <Nancy2012> on the line 50. which should return response (tData) … and if u take a look on the php función.. in both condition it returns false..
[02:07:44] <Nancy2012> then why is always return data value instead of response false..
[02:08:26] <Kingsy> dblosevn: is this available in firebug ?
[02:09:29] <star_prone> hi
[02:09:41] <mazzachre> OK, I have just had an error, and now I am confuzzled beyond means... I found my error, which was that my selector was input[name="something"], this but the field had changed to a select instead of a hidden input field... Nothing strange there (well took my half an hour to debug) but... but... It sometimes worked before I found the error... How?! How could it ever work? I don't understand...
[02:10:44] <dblosevn> lol
[02:11:03] <dblosevn> its not new it was invented around the time programming was invented
[02:11:06] <star_prone> i have a calendar on my page (the jquery-ui calendar) which will change the value of a disabled input type text field, when a date is selected. what is the event that I should define on the input element in order to capture the it when the date is selected
[02:11:35] <iksik> hello
[02:11:37] <Kingsy> dblosevn: ah, I found a way of displaying the listeners in chrome, looks like firebug is a little weird.
[02:12:04] <dblosevn> ya its there in firebug too but i prefer the chrome inspector
[02:12:41] <dblosevn> its always better when the debugger is native in the browser and not an extension
[02:13:17] <iksik> i'm looking for some UI plugin like this one http://layout.jquery-dev.net/ - but with ability of drag & drop panels between layout containers
[02:13:36] <iksik> anyone know if something like that exists somewhere?
[02:14:56] <Kingsy> damn it, I still cant alert() before it executes to the event code.
[02:15:00] <Kingsy> heh
[02:16:08] <Alarm_> hello. i have a theoretical question that might help me understand where my problem lays. So the scenarion is that i have a text field in a jquery window. i set the value and post the value with an ajax call to the server.  that works pretty fine. the problem is when i try to do that for the second  time. the ajax sends again the same value that i have set on the first run .
[02:16:26] <Alarm_> it only clears the value once i refresh the page.  where could i look in order to locate my problem ?
[02:17:41] <dblosevn> Alarm_: most likely your only grabbing the value of the text box once and reusing it
[02:17:58] <dblosevn> Alarm_: you need to get the value everytime before you post
[02:18:31] <dblosevn> without seeing the issue i cant tell you any better then that
[02:18:57] <granden> If I got $('input.days').change(function(){  });
[02:19:06] <granden> And got 7 checkboxes with the class days.
[02:19:15] <granden> How could I get the index of which checkbox is checked?
[02:19:58] <dblosevn> i dont think you do
[02:20:14] <Alarm_> dblosev i do get the value , the problem is that the value is always the same on every post
[02:20:39] <Alarm_> <input class="k-textbox reasoning-textbox-width" type="text" id="editingReasonInput"  name="editingReasonInput" /> if this is my textbox, with editingReasonInput.value i do get the value before setting in the ajax call
[02:21:04] <dblosevn> granden: youd have to do an each inside of the change callback and test until you find the one thats checked and grab the index from there
[02:21:06] <Alarm_> unfortunatelly the value remains the same  from the very first time it was set
[02:21:57] <dblosevn> you will get the value with $('#editingReasonInput').val() as well
[02:22:09] <nisseni> I'm getting the ID of an element I'm clicking. However, when I click a child element of that element I don't get it, is there a way to get the id of the parent id, or something?
[02:22:55] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/e99cai3m8n5nv0z621x4q - like this for example, when I click the "name"-element, I don't get the Id of the element I need
[02:22:57] <dblosevn> nisseni: does the parent have a class or id
[02:23:16] <nisseni> dblosevn: it's the id I want
[02:23:38] <nisseni> since it's a loop there are several elements that would have the same class
[02:23:46] <Alarm_> dblosevn:  here is the source http://pastebin.com/ygFJEtE3
[02:23:49] <treeprogram> Hi, can any one tell me why I'm getting this error: "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new p.fn.init(a,b,c)} has no method 'cookies' "
[02:24:21] <Alarm_> i open a window (kendo ui window) that contains the div seen in the paste site. set the value in the textbox, and submit it . the first time runs well
[02:24:45] <Alarm_> after that i cannot find a way to reset my value again and set it with a new one. i hope the source helps a bit
[02:26:09] <treeprogram> I have the cookies plug-in referenced, like this: <script src="jquery-cookie-master/jquery.cookie.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[02:26:23] <dblosevn> Alarm_: if (undefined !== $(this).attr('id')) { var id = $(this).closest('div').attr('id'); } else { var id = $(this).attr('id'); }
[02:27:21] <Alarm_> well it would be more helpful if i could also understand where the problem is :)
[02:28:09] <dblosevn> that basically says if this element doesnt have an id get me the id of the closest div up the tree
[02:28:51] <dblosevn> and my logic is backwards that should be if undefined ===
[02:29:40] <dblosevn> i would give the parent that has the id you want a class though
[02:30:19] <dblosevn> then you can do $(this).closest('.product-class').attr('id')
[02:30:57] <dblosevn> looks like your giving the div a numerical id thats a nono
[02:31:34] <dblosevn> id do <div class="product" data-id="101">
[02:31:36] <nesoi> hmm... so what can I do to make the last row in a scrolling listview not be obscured by the footer (jqm)?
[02:32:04] <Alarm_> dblosevn: thank you . the solution finaly was your suggestion with $('#editingReasonInput').val()
[02:32:24] <Alarm_> for some reason editingReasonInput.value returns the very first value set
[02:32:27] <dblosevn> nesoi: make sure your ul isnt taller then the content pane :-)
[02:32:32] <Alarm_> while the $('#editingReasonInput').val()  the latest.
[02:32:36] <Alarm_> i dont understand though why
[02:32:42] <nesoi> dblosevn : how does one control that?
[02:32:53] <dblosevn> Alarm_: because you should never do that to begin with :-P
[02:33:16] <Alarm_> thank you very much :)
[02:33:18] <dblosevn> theres this awesome thing called css and jquery :-) nesoi
[02:33:45] <nesoi> um... ok.. I guess that's for tomorrow :)
[02:33:52] <dblosevn> inspect the ul and see how tall it is
[02:33:53] <nesoi> nite all
[02:34:11] <dblosevn> if its too tall your doing something weird with the layout
[02:34:30] <nesoi> yeah, I have this funky resize code I copied from someone and I guess I need to make it deal with the ul too or something
[02:34:40] <nesoi> ttyl
[02:35:06] <dblosevn> no the resize code shhould only play with header, [data-role="content"] and footer
[02:35:09] <Nancy2012> i have a problem in ajax  response which always return data valúes..  http://pastebin.com/vMpS49uc
[02:35:10] <Nancy2012> on the line 50. which should return response (tData) … and if u take a look on the php función.. in both condition it returns false..
[02:35:21] <Nancy2012> then why is always return data value instead of response false..
[02:37:20] <nisseni> dblosevn: how can I extract the data id then?=
[02:37:29] <nisseni> dblosevn: nvm :P
[02:37:57] <dblosevn> var id = $(this).closest('.product').data('id')
[02:38:22] <nisseni> dblosevn: is data-id legit? is it supported by all browsers?
[02:38:37] <dblosevn> yes not somthing to support
[02:38:45] <dblosevn> its an attribute

[02:50:53] <nisseni> dblosevn: http://pastie.org/private/b00yzrorn3oh4oqi3kto6w - I want to open information-box by clicking on the "product-element" - maybe I don't even need ID for that? I tried opening it with "closest" but didnt' work
[02:51:17] <Nancy2012> here is my all code.. : http://pastebin.com/vMpS49uc
[02:55:12] <Nancy2012> my post and response on the ajax función is the same..
[02:55:13] <Nancy2012> a
[02:55:14] <Nancy2012> lwa
[02:55:22] <Nancy2012> it always returns the same values..
[02:55:41] <Nancy2012> see here.. http://pastebin.com/vMpS49uc
[03:05:08] <jacta> Can anyone help me find the error: http://jsfiddle.net/vdzTV/ - validated json and seems okay, or is it just me?
[03:05:40] <dblosevn> nisseni: add a class to the product div like ive told you 4 times now
[03:05:53] <nisseni> dblosevn: I did
[03:06:13] <nisseni> and I get the id... no problem, but I'm not sure I need it, I've already got the information I need in the information-box
[03:06:21] <nisseni> so I simply need to open it up :)
[03:06:21] <dblosevn> nisseni: $(this).closest('.product').find('.information-box').show()
[03:08:02] <Nancy2012> what wrong my code..  http://pastebin.com/vMpS49uc why do i always get post data value instead of false
[03:08:07] <Nancy2012> help me :(
[03:08:50] <nisseni> dblosevn: can't get it to work - looks like this now: http://pastie.org/private/2ybbsdmqau3idplcclvw
[03:10:38] <dblosevn> ... nisseni: of course you cant information-box isnt a child of product
[03:10:53] <nisseni> dblosevn: tried making it a child as well
[03:10:54] <dblosevn> nisseni: $(this).closest('.box-product').find('.information-box').show()
[03:11:16] <dblosevn> no that wont work
[03:11:30] <dblosevn> information-box has to be a child of div.product
[03:12:44] <nisseni> last suggestion opens all .information-box
[03:12:55] <sahbeewah> Nancy2012, what do you mean you get post data value?
[03:13:10] <Nancy2012> look at this.. http://jsfiddle.net/VxDCU/
[03:13:11] <Nancy2012> i
[03:13:16] <Nancy2012> made it so clear
[03:13:47] <Nancy2012> i m posting the value to php función for knowing if the product exists or not
[03:13:48] <nisseni> dblosevn: ^
[03:14:09] <dblosevn> Nancy2012: theres nothing clear about that
[03:14:38] <Nancy2012> response is result
[03:14:50] <Nancy2012> and it comes from checkSection function..
[03:14:59] <dblosevn> response is always the result lmao
[03:15:17] <dblosevn> nisseni: if you read my last suggestion you wouldnt have used it
[03:15:39] <Nancy2012> i m returning ….  if($checkId){return  msg =  "tyre exist.."; }else{   return  msg =  "tyre doesnt exist..";        }
[03:15:48] <dblosevn> [05:11] <dblosevn> no that wont work
[03:15:48] <dblosevn> [05:11] <dblosevn> information-box has to be a child of div.product
[03:16:06] <erdos> is anyone familiar with the colorbox plugin?
[03:16:07] <Nancy2012> so when i do alert(result) then it should print one of these meg… 
[03:16:14] <Nancy2012> either… tyre exist
[03:16:22] <Nancy2012> or tyre doesnt exists
[03:16:41] <sahbeewah> what's the context of the checkSection function?
[03:16:45] <Nancy2012> but why does my code always return the same data what am i passing to checkSection function
[03:16:58] <dblosevn> whats the resposne from the server look like, look at the net tab in the inspector
[03:17:13] <Trisox> men so ffing stressed
[03:17:24] <dblosevn> Trisox: me too
[03:17:37] <Nancy2012> CheckSection checks if the types exists … if yes.. then return message it is exist… if not then return message it doesnt exist
[03:17:37] <dblosevn> im flying back in like 10 hours and im nowhere near done
[03:17:37] <Trisox> rather give a presentation for 50 people then this
[03:17:43] <Nancy2012> it is clear
[03:17:49] <Trisox> ah florida here you come
[03:17:53] <dblosevn> yep
[03:17:58] <Trisox> :)
[03:18:03] <mandarks> hey guys
[03:18:04] <mandarks> PROBLEM: keep getting a js error saying unable to modify the parent container element before the child is finished loading. any idea?
[03:18:06] <Nancy2012> then why it always returns me ….. data values
[03:18:19] <Nancy2012> it should return the message which is on return
[03:18:23] <dblosevn> mandarks: wait till it finishes loading first?
[03:18:30] <Nancy2012>  if($checkId){return  msg =  "tyre exist.."; }else{   return  msg =  "tyre doesnt exist..";        }
[03:18:40] <dblosevn> they made this crazy event called domready just for that purpose :-D
[03:18:44] <mandarks> i wrapped it in n load block
[03:18:59] <dblosevn> domready and load are not the same
[03:19:06] <dblosevn> load means the content is loaded
[03:19:18] <dblosevn> ready means that the content is rendered
[03:19:28] <sahbeewah> Nancy2012, but what file is the checkSection in? is the result of checkSection being outputted to the file that's handling the base_url/admin/checkSection url?
[03:19:44] <mandarks> loaded is all i need coz its performance testing related
[03:19:48] <sahbeewah> just because you're returning it from the function, doesn't mean it's being outputted to the resulting returned file
[03:20:18] <dblosevn> mandarks: oviously its not because your getting an error about the content not being rendered when you try to modify it
[03:20:33] <Trisox> dblosevn: i get the preview view of my home...
[03:20:39] <Nancy2012> yes,..,
[03:20:40] <Nancy2012> it does
[03:20:45] <Trisox> to see whats wrong
[03:20:53] <Nancy2012> my code is very simple..
[03:20:54] <Nancy2012> $.ajax({url: '<?php echo base_url(); ?>product/admin/checkSection',type: 'post',data: {id:product_id,section:section},cache: false,dataType:"html",success: function(result){alert(result);if(result == false){alert('nook');}else{alert('ok');}},error:function(){alert('An error occured when ordering the images.');}});
[03:20:59] <Trisox> dblosevn: i get the key in next week
[03:21:03] <Trisox> so bit stressed
[03:21:17] <dblosevn> nice nice
[03:21:19] <mandarks> fyi, its in ie.. firefox, chrome and several other browsers work fine
[03:21:25] <dblosevn> dont know that id be stressed about that
[03:21:44] <mandarks> client requirements
[03:21:45] <dblosevn> mandarks: of course it is lol
[03:22:05] <dblosevn> im telling you use ready
[03:22:16] <dblosevn> the problem will magically go away
[03:22:21] <mandarks> kk
[03:24:34] <Trisox> dblosevn: you not stressed?
[03:24:47] <bamarni> hi, I have a selector matching a link on which I bind a click event, durig this click event, I remove the link and create another one, the selector should still match this newly created link (same class), but when I click on it, it doesn't work, it's lke a standard html link, do you know why?
[03:26:11] <sahbeewah> because the newly created link didn't exist when you binded it
[03:26:15] <dblosevn> lol of course i am
[03:26:25] <dblosevn> this project is blowing up in my face
[03:26:28] <dblosevn> i need another month
[03:26:58] <dblosevn> cant get reliaable devs working with me so im doing everything
[03:27:02] <dblosevn> -a
[03:27:15] <mandarks> it's probably because your use of ready's, never magically worked
[03:27:32] <mandarks> blew up in my face just then
[03:27:44] <dblosevn> um... if you use it the right way it will work great
[03:28:16] <dblosevn> .load(url, fucntion() { //inject data $(function() { //manipulate the dom })});
[03:28:19] <mandarks> no, i've got a hunch its related to cached js
[03:28:28] <dblosevn> or
[03:28:33] <dblosevn> skip the ready
[03:28:41] <dblosevn> in the load callback
[03:29:04] <dblosevn> $el = $('<div />');
[03:29:12] <dblosevn> append to $el
[03:29:21] <dblosevn> manipulate $el
[03:29:39] <dblosevn> then inject $el into the body
[03:29:44] <dblosevn> or whereever you want it
[03:30:10] <dblosevn> the only issue is the extra div might not be wanted
[03:31:54] <dblosevn> i almost never use .load though id rather be in full control of the ajax call but thats just me :-)
[03:33:35] <ismartboi> i am trying to set the height of the body same as the browser window height, i have used this but its not getting it to full height http://pastebin.com/WB3qkwxk
[03:38:35] <tlkr> ismartboi, do you have any padding on the body?
[03:39:55] <ismartboi> tlkr: no
[03:40:26] <tlkr> what is the difference between the window height and the body height after running that script?
[03:41:49] <ismartboi> the height that its showing now is 618px
[03:46:22] <Trudko> Guys I cant find some customize dropdowns and input fields for Jquery theme -ui darkness
[03:46:41] <jacta> Can anyone help me find the error: http://jsfiddle.net/vdzTV/ - validated json and seems okay, or is it just me?
[03:46:59] <talktokets> Trudko: Can u be more specific ?
[03:46:59] <jacta> but it seems like its telling me that json is wrong?
[03:47:37] <Trudko> talktokets:  yeah check here http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!zThemeParams=5d00000100ea05000000000000003d8888d844329a8dfe02723de3e5701cc8cb8a0f4166c8f002bb384a9a94d46b66930ecd1d30314057ff273da42b76034e7df160b9e7ba7002682805fc5802b2a0549efda864da8b43871254a8db50234db11c2645a6a024432bad09b8d7855d6a3efb8321417f716f7d2a0078a45300e3d900039407cc7e51331b176feb95a8300678e4341c911cea30065cfd91c786e8b573d92c84c46463957b2130c9a63f5009ec928e4f6c
[03:47:40] <Trudko> ops
[03:47:58] <Trudko> that is longer than I thought. Anyway where are examples of input fields or selects
[03:48:29] <dblosevn> wow... i just spent half an hour trying to figure out why my images wernt loading into my grid and i had the wrong field name in one spot in the grid config grrr
[03:49:28] <talktokets> wait checking
[03:50:23] <Trudko> talktokets: do you know what I mean?
[03:50:23] <Cork> jacta: is the server returning jsonp?
[03:50:39] <talktokets> ummm kind of
[03:50:53] <jacta> Cork, its this url: http://9l.dk/zhopz/json?cats
[03:51:05] <jacta> dunno what it would be returning, I have set some headers
[03:51:07] <Cork> jacta: thats json, not jsonp
[03:51:27] <Cork> jacta: the server needs to make a javascript call in the response if you call for jsonp
[03:51:39] <Trudko> talktokets: also it seems that jquery does not have theme for tables
[03:51:44] <jacta> oh, i need to use it in a phonegap - dunno whats easiest for that purpose
[03:52:00] <jacta> right now I just json_encode the array from mysql
[03:52:00] <talktokets> Trudko: U want to use drop down list. Right?
[03:52:27] <Cork> php example: <?php echo $_GET['callback']; ?>(<?php echo JSON_encode(); ?>);
[03:52:34] <Cork> jacta: ^
[03:53:09] <jacta> Cork, i use this right now: echo '{"cats":'.json_encode($rows).'}'; -- is that wrong then?
[03:53:13] <Cork> jacta: is the call is from the same domain, just remove the &callback part
[03:53:17] <ravenzz> maybe with some extra check
[03:53:20] <Cork> jacta: yes
[03:53:21] <Trudko> talktokets: i picked ui darkness theme but by dropdowsn , my input fields and my table look  same they dont have any style
[03:53:36] <jacta> Cork, its from another domain also
[03:53:48] <Cork> jacta: ok, then you need to add the code i showed you
[03:54:37] <jacta> and what about the url then?
[03:54:46] <Cork> what about it?
[03:54:50] <dblosevn> cork: its phonegap, phonegap doesnt honor cross domain security policys
[03:55:08] <dblosevn> can just pull a standard request
[03:55:13] <Cork> dblosevn: he's still doing jsonp
[03:55:55] <jacta> I just need to fetch json(p) to some elements and loop them - how is not the matter, just so phonegap can do it
[03:56:05] <talktokets> Trudko: On which browser u have tested ? and OS ?
[03:56:09] <jacta> I'm really new, so dont know what way is easiest
[03:56:51] <dblosevn> your jsonp response looks good now
[03:57:45] <jacta> atleast great! :)
[03:58:02] <Trudko> talktokets: chrome, but  do they even provide styales for tables input etc?
[03:59:00] <talktokets> I think for table there are no styles. And does ur chrome shows any errors in Console OR Net Panel?
[04:00:25] <Trudko> talk no i dont think there are any styles in first place
[04:01:14] <Cork> jacta: json is what your server is sending, for jquery to handle that you need to remove the &callback=? in the url
[04:01:26] <Cork> jacta: normal browsers will block that call though
[04:01:59] <Che-Anarc> I was looking for UI framwork to do drop down menu & nested <select> 's with buttons?
[04:02:00] <Cork> jacta: alternatively the server needs to send a jsonp response; thats basically a javascript file with a function call with the json as an argument
[04:02:04] <Che-Anarc> any recommendations?
[04:02:33] <talktokets> Trudko: Tell me one thing, from where u have selected "ui darkness" and applied  ?
[04:02:48] <Cork> jacta: right now your sending json, and jquery tries to execute it as javascript, and that won't work
[04:04:21] <Trudko> talktokets:  what do you mean?
[04:04:59] <star_prone> i have a calendar on my page (the jquery-ui calendar) which will change the value of a disabled input type text field, when a date is selected. what is the event that I should define on the input element in order to capture the it when the date is selected
[04:05:03] <talktokets> Trudko: As u said earlier "i picked ui darkness theme but by dropdowsn , my input fields and my table look  same they dont have any style" . Thats y i hav asked
[04:05:15] <star_prone> i have a calendar on my page (the jquery-ui calendar) which will change the value of a disabled input type text field, when a date is selected. what is the event that I should define on the input element in order to capture it when the date is selected
[04:05:23] <Trudko> from JQuery UI website
[04:06:12] <dblosevn> Cork: he already added the callback to the response http://9l.dk/zhopz/json?cats&callback=me123
[04:07:58] <Cork> so he did >_>
[04:09:06] <talktokets> Trudko: R u designing a website or wat? Coz u can use still perfect tools for jQuery UI. hence asking.
[04:09:45] <Trudko> talktokets: yes I am so I picked jquery UI theme but I need some styles for table input fields and dropdowns
[04:10:14] <Trudko> my question was if Jquery ui really does not have styles for this or did I missed something. If they do not have styles for table inputs and dropdowns then what shoul I us?
[04:11:25] <Cork> Trudko: what do you mean by table inputs?
[04:11:54] <the_dark_knight> hi, I have a text field - <input name="editPurchaseDiscount" id="editPurchaseDiscount" type="text">  . I want it to only accept a fload ranging from 0 to 100. How do I do it using jquery?
[04:12:47] <Cork> the_dark_knight: you would have to use a keydown and filter based on the keyCode
[04:12:56] <Cork> *keydown event
[04:13:03] <Trudko> Cork, i meant table, input(texts), dropdowns
[04:13:15] <talktokets> Trudko: u first apply UI-darkness theme to the site, it will show changes there. Then after that dowload that theme.
[04:13:15] <talktokets> A zip file will be downloaded to ur PC. Then extract the " .js " contents to required folder and include that in ur html file
[04:13:19] <talktokets> try this
[04:13:21] <Cork> Trudko: you can't just simply style those
[04:13:26] <talktokets> may it will work
[04:13:27] <Cork> Trudko: you have to replace them
[04:13:44] <Trudko> Cork does jquery UI theme provides replacements?
[04:13:45] <Cork> Trudko: input form elements has style rules to "look natively"
[04:13:53] <Cork> Trudko: for some of them
[04:13:55] <Cork> but not all
[04:14:05] <Cork> you can replace select boxes
[04:14:19] <mazzachre> Is this a good way of doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/2/
[04:14:25] <Cork> but not inputs (those can be stules quite well though)
[04:14:25] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/6116032 Why does my ajax request "cancel out" the validation of the varienForm. If I comment out the entire ajax request my validation rule works fine. With the ajax request active it almost "ignores" the validation
[04:14:27] <Trudko> i did not find anything for things I mentioned... I found  autocomplete comboxo for select maybe
[04:14:45] <the_dark_knight> Hi, cork. please have a look here - http://jsfiddle.net/hussaintamboli/9Ry9t/87/.
[04:15:52] <the_dark_knight> Cork: from above jsfiddle, My last if condition is preventing everything I enter instead of preventing it when the number is less than 0 and greater than 100.
[04:16:20] <Cork> the_dark_knight: you can't use .val()
[04:16:21] <talktokets> Trudko:  ^^
[04:16:33] <Cork> the_dark_knight: and you can't use keypress
[04:16:47] <Cork> the_dark_knight: you need to store and update a separate variable, and use keydown
[04:17:08] <Cork> the_dark_knight: then add and subtract from the string from it
[04:17:13] <Cork> -from it
[04:17:42] <Cork> the_dark_knight: keypress is triggered when the char has already been entered in the input field, so you can't block it there
[04:17:46] <Trudko> cork tip where to look for because tey have to match I guess I will have to stylle them my self in the end
[04:17:53] <Cork> the_dark_knight: and keydown is before, so its not in the field yet
[04:18:30] <Cork> Trudko: for select is in http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[04:18:46] <Cork> Trudko: checkboxes you should just forget, that will break more then it helps
[04:18:46] <the_dark_knight> Cork: updated it, http://jsfiddle.net/hussaintamboli/9Ry9t/89/ still doesn't work.
[04:19:02] <Cork> the_dark_knight: you can't use .val() <--
[04:19:05] <the_dark_knight> Cork: Why can't I use val()

[04:19:19] <the_dark_knight> Cork: should i use text()
[04:19:36] <talktokets> Trudko: and also this : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4985452/how-to-apply-theme-to-select
[04:19:39] <Cork> js> var a = ""; if(a == "a") { /* block */ }; a += 'a';
[04:19:42] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:19:58] <Cork> the_dark_knight: you'r testing before its in there so its pointless
[04:20:26] <Cork> .val() will be whats in the field except for what is about to be entered
[04:21:13] <Cork> the_dark_knight: and yes fiddling with blocking input characters is a PAIN, i know
[04:22:15] <Cork> the_dark_knight: and thats why most sites choose to run it as validators afterwards instead
[04:22:30] <Cork> cause the input is very hard to get to work well
[04:24:17] <the_dark_knight> Cork: what would you do?
[04:24:35] <Cork> the_dark_knight: i've done the input thing a few times
[04:24:54] <Cork> but when you have to start handling ppl pasting in, and backspace/delete and so on
[04:25:07] <Cork> it becomes VERY boring >_>
[04:25:14] <Cork> so i would go with the validation solution
[04:25:23] <Cork> its the most stable solution you can use
[04:25:37] <the_dark_knight> Cork: I wan't to put percentage. So the value must be from 0 - 100.
[04:26:00] <the_dark_knight> Cork: Ok. I will try the validation.
[04:26:39] <the_dark_knight> Cork: I will validate the whole text field in jquery.
[04:26:45] * Cork nods
[04:35:30] <Che-Anarc> How can I do a nested drop down menus with buttons and other elements using jquery mobile?... I tried with adding data-role="button" within <options> / <select>.
[04:40:34] <Cork> Che-Anarc: you can't style a select box or its option element
[04:40:39] <Cork> Che-Anarc: you need to replace it all
[04:43:26] <fs0i> Hi guys, I got a problem: I have a problem: I want to load sth. within a jquery-script from another server under my control. The problem is: The script can be executed on *every* server, so I don't know where the script is executed. I want to make an ajax call to my server, but I get an error:
[04:43:48] <fs0i> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://mpc/paper/2. Origin http://blub is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[04:44:06] <fs0i> But the error could also be
[04:44:11] <fs0i> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://mpc/paper/2. Origin http://blub2 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[04:44:20] <talktokets> Trudko_: prblm solved ?
[04:44:41] <fs0i> How can I allow *every* host to make requests to my server?
[04:45:22] <Cork> ?mdc cors

[04:45:30] <Cork> fs0i: ^
[04:47:37] <fs0i> I alread HAD that solution. I just forgot to restart my server. Argh! Sorry for brothering you!
[04:49:42] <Cork> fs0i: warning though, ie won't care
[04:51:38] <fs0i> Well, gladly chrome is the only browser this project needs support for, it is a desktop / andorid app :)
[04:53:39] <Trudko_> talktokets: I will probably use something else maybe boostrap
[04:54:13] <pallet> Hi there, what's wrong here please if ($("#a0oauthtoken").val() != "") {$("#twitter-auth").css('display','none');}
[04:54:51] <talktokets> ok
[04:54:54] <pallet> basically, I'm trying to see if an input is NOT empty, if so then hide a button
[04:55:37] <pachet> try logging the .val()
[04:55:41] <pachet> see if it's what you expect
[04:55:47] <pachet> also log the result of those selectors
[04:55:54] <pachet> make sure the elements are found
[04:56:02] <unik> hi. is there a way to select tags that its content string start with an '-'? like <div>-foo</div>
[04:57:06] <talktokets> unik: Can u be more specific plz ?
[04:58:34] <pachet> unik: not without walking every node in the dom ;[
[04:58:47] <pachet> you'd be much better off if you could narrow the scope of your search
[04:58:58] <pachet> to, say, all the children of a specific container
[04:59:50] <unik> I need to select the divs of a specific class where its content text start with an hyphen.
[05:00:30] <pachet> oh, well there you go
[05:00:33] <pachet> that's better already
[05:01:38] <pachet> $('.myclass').filter(function ( i ) { return this.innerHTML [0] === '-'; })
[05:01:41] <pachet> unik^
[05:03:14] <brantje> Will this work: $('.comments[id="'+id+']"')
[05:03:50] <unik> pachet: thanks. the [0] is for the first character?
[05:03:58] <pachet> yup
[05:19:14] <jn_> I have a submenu ul targeted with "this" can I then chain backwards and select the mainmenu which the submen ul is nested in ? Hope makes sense

[07:25:54] <Nancy2012> :(
[07:26:52] <czytacz> pachet: unfortunately that doesn't work.
[07:27:22] <dblosevn> Nancy2012: for one dont flood the channel and two that is a var dump from php which is interpreted as an object in js
[07:28:17] <pachet> Nancy2012: your xhr request tells your controller to call this checkSection method?
[07:28:27] <pachet> and the checkSection method generates some JSON to pass back?
[07:29:20] <Nancy2012> i did it but it returns like this on my firebug consolé on response array(3) { ["id"]=> string(1) "1" ["langs"]=> string(9) "0,1,4,2,3" ["totaImage"]=> string(1) "5" }

[07:29:42] <pachet> Nancy2012: you didnt answer my question
[07:29:55] <pachet> s/question/questions, even
[07:29:58] <Nancy2012> yes
[07:30:11] <jeturcotte> halllo; does anyone know why, after i've set 'tabindex' for a <p> tag and them a <em> tag, jquery's .focus() will happily set focus on the p but NOT on the em?
[07:30:18] <pachet> so if the return value of checkSection() is supposed to be a JSON string
[07:30:29] <pachet> why are you returning json_decode()
[07:31:04] <Nancy2012> i tried.. but it wouldnt help me to print my valúes and defined them into variable on sucess fuction
[07:31:19] <Nancy2012> i tried using json_decode
[07:31:49] <Nancy2012> i m doing like this echo json_decode($checkdata);
[07:31:56] <pachet> hint: you want json_encode
[07:32:02] <Nancy2012> but it wouldnt return anything on response
[07:32:04] <pachet> hint #2: /join #php
[07:32:34] <Nancy2012> yes.. i want these array data what i have inside checkSection función
[07:32:57] <Nancy2012> and i want to pass these array data to success function
[07:33:09] <Nancy2012> so i will defined them as a variable
[07:33:12] <Nancy2012> and use them
[07:33:21] <Nancy2012> that is thing what i want
[07:34:50] <jeturcotte> so no ideas why, re: … <em tabindex='100'>stuff</em> cannot receive .focus() via jQuery?
[07:34:58] <Nancy2012> i m simply printing the result valúes … success     : function(result){ alert(result); }
[07:35:26] <Nancy2012> and on the función …  $obj = json_decode($checkdata); print_r($obj);
[07:35:46] <Nancy2012> i dont know why .. my response is empty
[07:36:00] <Nancy2012> pachet:  any idea?¿
[07:36:41] <Kingsy> can someone briefly explain this --> $('body').on('click', 'a[rel^=lightbox], area[rel^=lightbox]', function(e) { });   more specifically the rel^=lightbox part, what exactly is that saying?
[07:36:56] <Nancy2012> pachet: can you please replyt me
[07:36:58] <Nancy2012> please
[07:36:59] <tlkr> jeturcotte, the em element does not have a focus event. In the same way that <strong> doesn't
[07:37:10] <pachet> Kingsy: he's saying
[07:37:15] <pachet> any time someone clicks the body element
[07:37:19] <pachet> (so any click basically)
[07:37:33] <pachet> check if the specific element clicked is either an anchor with the 'rel' attribute starting with 'lightbox'
[07:37:37] <Nancy2012> pachet: you just say.. u can help me or not? i really dont want to bother you guys
[07:37:43] <pachet> or, an <area> element with the rel element starting with lightbox
[07:37:51] <pachet> that little ^= just means 'starting with'
[07:37:52] <Nancy2012> please
[07:37:56] <pachet> in lieu of actual regex :[
[07:38:03] <jeturcotte> tikr: but p does?
[07:38:09] <Kingsy> ah it means starting with
[07:38:18] <jeturcotte> is there a list out there somewhere?
[07:38:29] <Nancy2012> here is my code.. http://jsfiddle.net/4HUL9/
[07:39:18] <jeturcotte> hmm, let me try that again tikr
[07:39:18] <Nancy2012> i want to convertí these función return valúes into variable… on  success     : function(result){
[07:39:27] <jeturcotte> or is that tlkr
[07:39:29] <jeturcotte> there we go
[07:39:34] <Nancy2012> any idea?
[07:40:00] <jeturcotte> okay; so tlkr; are you suggesting then that <p> DOES have a focus function despite needing to have a tabindex created first?  is there a list out there of tags that do and dont support this?
[07:40:50] <Nancy2012> i m using var_dump($checkdata);
[07:40:54] <iksik> hmm, i've got something like <div class="foo"><div class="foo"><div>a</div><div>b</div></div><div>a</div><div>b</div></div> - is it possible to select div elements inside 'foo' but not divs inside of nested foo?
[07:41:00] <Nancy2012> but it wouldnt work
[07:41:06] <Nancy2012> please have a look my code

[07:41:52] <Nancy2012> ease
[07:41:53] <Nancy2012> e
[07:41:54] <pachet> jeturcotte: so, short answer is 'its up to the browser'
[07:41:58] <Nancy2012> sorry
[07:42:02] <Nancy2012> :(
[07:42:03] <tlkr> Nancy2012, that's annoying.
[07:42:23] <pachet> Nancy2012: you have php problems, not jquery problems
[07:42:24] <Kingsy> pachet: ok, well that click executes with the following --> rel="lightbox[whatever]" and rel="lightbox"    however if you change it from rel to class, it works with  class="lightbox" but not class="lightbox[whatever]"     can you see a reason for that?
[07:42:25] <pachet> go ask there
[07:42:49] <jeturcotte> this is for a me-only administrative control page, so i don't have to have universal compatibility by any means… but where possible, it would be nice
[07:43:35] <jeturcotte> interesting the first link makes no mention of em
[07:43:40] <jeturcotte> the 2nd link is still loading
[07:44:22] <pachet> Kingsy: hm, it should work with either attribute
[07:44:25] <pachet> have code?
[07:44:37] <jeturcotte> ah, but according to stackoverflow, "Any element with a tabindex" … which is wrong (at least for safari)
[07:44:55] <Kingsy> pachet: ahh, it looks like it works with  class="lightbox..."   but not   class="lightbox..   someother class tags"
[07:44:59] <jeturcotte> wheeeeee
[07:45:12] <pachet> Kingsy: oh right, yeah
[07:45:30] <Kingsy> pachet: is there an easy way to modify the click identifier so you can have multiple classtags if the "lightbox" is always at the start?
[07:46:18] <pachet> Kingsy, well, to be honest, you're going to get better performance if you use actual css class selectors for that anyway
[07:46:22] <pachet> rather than attr selectors
[07:46:36] <Kingsy> ah ok cool
[07:46:43] <pachet> so just $('body').on('click', '.lightbox', function ( e ) { });
[07:46:43] <Stephen> Ah, yes, CSS selector priorities
[07:47:11] <pachet> yeah that came out sounding a bit confused
[07:47:19] <Stephen> http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/images/specificitywars-05v2.jpg
[07:47:21] <pachet> s/css class selectors/class selector syntax
[07:47:25] <Stephen> Use that as reference
[07:47:47] <jeturcotte> I definitely need a .focus()able alternative to p … since p is already in use
[07:47:50] <Kingsy> pachet: and what if the classname is   lightbox[whaever] ?
[07:48:54] <Stephen> jeturcotte: <blocktext>
[07:48:57] <Stephen> maybe
[07:49:18] <jeturcotte> i'll try Stephen, thanks
[07:50:06] <Stephen> jedimind: Here's the kicker: It varies by browser
[07:50:17] <Stephen> er, jeturcotte
[07:50:18] <jeturcotte> alternative, I suppose, I can add a click event to any given p tag with sets aside a form I can atype into and, on exiting, applies the styling choices to said p-tag
[07:50:19] <jedimind> wat
[07:50:30] <pachet> Kingsy: eh, try $('body').on('click', 'a[class^="lightbox"],a[class*=" lightbox"]', function ( ) { })
[07:50:49] <pachet> Kingsy: but really you only need that first selector if you are going to have classes like 'foo-lightbox-wat'
[07:50:56] <pachet> that you want to exclude :[
[07:51:07] <Stephen> jeturcotteL Why do you need an alternative to <p>?
[07:51:14] <pachet> otherwise just 'a[class*="lightbox"]' will work
[07:51:47] <pachet> ?wat @ jedimind
[07:51:48] <bot-t> jedimind, Boom! Did you are unimpressed? and now? http://bit.ly/i2SDjX
[07:52:05] <jedimind> twat
[07:52:22] <jeturcotte> because when one enters 'styling mode' it needs to leave the p-tag temporarily so that further edits are kept separate from the content of the p-tag until 'styling' is complete (and which point it is applied to the tag and focus is returned)
[07:53:30] <Stephen> jeturcotte: set it's tabindex to -1
[07:53:35] <Kingsy> pachet: your a legend man, it works like a charm
[07:53:51] <Stephen> That forces the element to only be focusable by javascript
[07:53:56] <jeturcotte> <em> was convenient insofar as it could be inside the p-tag and visually automatically be different than the content and subsequently destroyed… but it refuses focus
[07:54:10] <jeturcotte> hmm -1… I'll try it; thanks Stephen++
[07:54:33] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Setting tabindex to 0 makes it first focus, and higher is its order
[07:55:02] <Stephen> try setting <em tabindex="somecrazyhighnumberifnotfirstfocus">
[07:55:08] <jeturcotte> so the idea is not to rely on jquery to set focus but try to meta the same effect
[07:55:40] <Stephen> I'm coming in on the question late, so I'm not sure
[07:55:53] <Stephen> Can you explain the problem behavior?
[07:55:58] <jeturcotte> naw it sounds like a plausible experiment
[07:56:32] <Stephen> Great, lemme know how it goes
[07:57:12] <Stephen> I'm particularly interested if setting tabindex=-1 blurs the element, or if tabindex=0 auto focuses the element
[07:57:17] <jeturcotte> well, i have a simple jquery module written that, when you click on a tag, creates a tabindex and immediate sets focus.  Another function enables typing straight into said tags (which works fine) … if I use the first func on a p tag it works like a charm… if I use it on an em, it only sets the tabindex, but focus fails
[07:58:03] <Stephen> why not manage classes instead of a second element?
[07:58:12] <jeturcotte> if i tab my way thtough the page it will eventually cycle to the em and i can type into it… but .focus() itself refuses to go to it
[07:58:13] <Stephen> Elements can have multiple classes
[07:58:44] <jeturcotte> well, i have to be able to see what i'm typing … so I needed a visual place
[07:59:21] <Stephen> Which browser are you working in?
[07:59:45] <jeturcotte> theoretically, i'm in a p-tag… I hit CtrlZ (opens style mode)… and I type a prefab style, css, or write my own css… CtrlZ again and it applies that to the tag in question… creating a sub-tag and focusing on it allows me to know what part of the content is and is not my style
[07:59:49] <jeturcotte> safari
[07:59:53] <Stephen> According to this, Firefox will give focus to any element with a tabindex >=1, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Focus_management_in_HTML?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Focus_management_in_HTML
[07:59:53] <jeturcotte> with tests in chrome
[07:59:56] <jeturcotte> so far the same
[08:00:02] <Stephen> I wonder  if Safari is the same
[08:00:09] <Stephen> Don't use 0 in this case
[08:00:15] <Stephen> 1 or above for em would be better
[08:00:44] <jeturcotte> so far everything's been given a tabindex of 100 by default
[08:00:51] <jeturcotte> which the em happily accepts
[08:00:54] <Stephen> There is a list of non-focusable elements there
[08:01:01] <jeturcotte> but even with it it won't take .focus() from jquery
[08:01:12] <jeturcotte> looking
[08:01:50] <jeturcotte> pages are loading slow today… wonder what's up (</rant>)
[08:02:33] <Stephen> jeturcotte: According to this link, divs should take focus using the same tabindex method: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3656467/is-it-possible-to-focus-on-a-div-using-javascript-focus-function
[08:06:19] <jeturcotte> hmm, same list as at the stackoverflow site
[08:07:20] <Stephen> jeturcotte: You might also try  .click() instead of .focus()
[08:08:15] <Stephen> Why is it that you need to have a separate distinct element inside of the <p>? why not just a <p class="whatever">?
[08:08:24] <Stephen> jeturcotte^\
[08:08:32] <jeturcotte> i suppose if i try it in FF later and it works, we can declare that <em> is NOT on the list of jQuery-safe .focus()ables in webkit
[08:09:19] <jeturcotte> because the user needs the opportunity to type out the style they want to have applied to that tag, and not have it confused with the rest of the tag's content
[08:09:24] <Stephen> jeturcotte: <span> should be focusable as well
[08:09:54] <Stephen> Ah, I see
[08:10:01] <Nece228> i just reinstalled lamp
[08:10:11] <Stephen> you're trying to give <p> a default child node
[08:10:13] <Nece228> now jquery code doesnt work, could it be that some kind of php error reporting or something brake json outputs
[08:10:26] <Nece228> i mean $.getJSON
[08:10:41] <jeturcotte> so it creates a child tag temporarily, focus goes to it, you type up your style… you end the tag, its contents get read and applied as style='<contents>' to the parent p-tag and then gets destroyed
[08:10:43] <jeturcotte> in theory
[08:10:48] <Stephen> Nece228: Yes, install firebug and watch the Network console & Console
[08:11:11] <Stephen> Nece228: Alternatively, use Fiddler2 to hunt down the offending response
[08:11:16] <Stephen> It's a great tool
[08:11:17] <Nece228> Stephen: cant chrome do something
[08:11:25] <jeturcotte> if you are in a p-tag, right now, and hit enter, it successfully creates a NEW p tag and shifts focus to it… but if i do an em, whether before, after, or as a child, it refuses focus
[08:11:33] <Stephen> Nece228: Yes, Fiddler2 or Developer Tools
[08:11:58] <jeturcotte> but it both needs to display its contents and not be a p-tag
[08:12:01] <Stephen> Nece228: In Chrome, hit F12
[08:12:11] <jeturcotte> div, span, em, strong, i dunno
[08:12:13] <Stephen> Nece228: Network and Console tabs there will assist you
[08:12:28] <Stephen> hmm
[08:12:35] <Stephen> So setting the tabindex isn't helping
[08:12:36] <Nece228> Stephen: ok, but i need to enable console logging in jquery?
[08:12:40] <Stephen> Not exactly
[08:12:41] <jeturcotte> right it isn't
[08:12:45] <Stephen> Nece228: No
[08:12:58] <jeturcotte> both the p and the em are tabindexed but the p will take focus and the em will not
[08:13:14] <jeturcotte> i THINK i tried span, too, and it refused focus as well… though i may be misremembering that one
[08:13:23] <Stephen> Nece228: But if you have the dev version of jquery it /could/ be helpful. I doubt you'll need it. The problem responses usually stick out like a sore thumb
[08:13:43] <Nece228> i meant console.log()
[08:13:57] <Nece228> Stephen: my code is absolutely untouched after reinstalling lamp
[08:14:13] <Nece228> so far console outputs nothing
[08:14:33] <jeturcotte> i may give up and put a dblclick() on the ptags which just creates a floating div i can type into… but i'd like to avoid mouse interaction if i can
[08:14:41] <Stephen> jeturcotte: It's possible the rendering engine hasn't caught up with the tabindex change when you do the focus. You might try .detach().attach().focus()
[08:15:15] <jeturcotte> Stephen++ I will research those… it seems like be fine with p tags but so far that' the only one that has cooperated among what i've tried
[08:15:24] <pachet> i'd be surprised if that was what was going on
[08:15:30] <Nece228> i need to put console.log() line
[08:15:36] <pachet> more likely just a browser-specific behavior
[08:15:53] <jme> hey all
[08:15:55] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Can you paste me the configured styles on the <p>?
[08:16:09] <jeturcotte> ocnfigured styles?
[08:16:22] <Stephen> It's possible some inherited property is the culprit, and not the elements themselves
[08:16:22] <jorn> hi, i have a website with a huge tree structure with several nested <ul><li><a class="mnuItm">some text</a</li>… elements. is there a convenient way to traverse this and transform it into a tab indented list of the "some text"s?
[08:16:53] <jeturcotte> oh
[08:16:54] <jeturcotte> well
[08:17:01] <Stephen> jeturcotte: In chrome, pull up the dev tools, use the HTML pane to find the elment. Select it, on the right there should be a configured styles section
[08:17:53] <jeturcotte> prior to the .typehere() function (my custom one), you have a <p></p> … no attributes… same with the <em></em> … after .typehere(), they're <p tabindex='100'></p> and <em tabindex='100'></em> …
[08:18:18] <jme> I have a dropdown menu, basically <ul> tags under <li> tags, like this <ul> level one<li>child one</li> <ul> level two {etc....}, and I have some code that drops down the first level fine, but also the second level, which is not what I want. How do I drop down just the first level under the currently selected <ul> -- or <li>, whichever is correct?
[08:18:29] <jeturcotte> literally all it does is assign tabindex if there isn't one already and then immediately apply .focus()
[08:19:13] <jorn> currently i iterate over all the $(".mnuItm") and use parents("ul").each() to print tabs into the console log… will that preserve the order?
[08:19:40] <Stephen> hmm
[08:19:44] <jeturcotte> and if i hit the tab key, it will cycle through both
[08:19:59] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Apparently <p> isn't allowed to have block level elements as children
[08:20:05] <jeturcotte> but if I start typing, it will work with the p tag (as focus was successful) but not with the em
[08:20:22] <jeturcotte> i've tried the em both inside and outside the p tag with the same result
[08:20:31] <pachet> jorn: should, yeah
[08:20:31] <hugo_moss> hey, if i do an ajax request of a group of images, and the folder location that images point to is mislabeled, that ajax request should fail. why do all subsequent image pulls (ajax requests) from all correct folders fail? it stops loading every other images as well
[08:20:49] <pachet> hugo_moss: you're sure those requests go out?
[08:21:03] <pachet> sure it's not an error in your ajax error handler that prevents subsequent reqs from going out?
[08:21:08] <jeturcotte> and regardless.. if the em is inside or outside the p, if I tab to it and then start typing, content goes into the em… it just will not accept .focus() from jQuery
[08:22:21] <jeturcotte> the hoped for behavior is that when i want to start styling a tag, I hit CtrlZ, it creates the em and focus is immediate… i type the style… hit crtlz again to stop the mode… it sucks up the contents of the em and applies them as a style to the parent tag, and destroys the em… no having to tab or click around
[08:22:24] <Stephen> jeturcotte: How are you setting tabindex?
[08:22:27] <Stephen> Can you paste the line:?
[08:23:46] <jeturcotte> does this room have regulations on posting code?
[08:24:10] <delboy1978uk> anyone here any good with jquery.validate rules?
[08:24:15] <jeturcotte> i know some prefer pastebins
[08:24:20] <Stephen> prefer a pastbin or something
[08:24:23] <delboy1978uk> use pastebin
[08:24:24] <Stephen> 1 line should be ok
[08:24:35] <jeturcotte> i'll compact this a bit
[08:24:44] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Also, I'm not sure how you are checking on whether .focus() works or not, but if you've created an editor here, it would also be prudent to set the contentEditable property to true as well
[08:25:12] <delboy1978uk> is there a way to check if at least one check box has been ticked using jquery.validate.js?
[08:25:12] <Stephen> From what I'm reading in the Safari docs, em is definitely a focusable element
[08:25:18] <hugo_moss> pachet: yeah, thank you, thats exactly whats happening
[08:25:18] <jeturcotte> if(this.attr('tabindex')){  this.focus(); } else { this.attr('tabindex', 100); this.focus(); }
[08:25:20] <jme> it seems I can write code for each level of submenus but I'm not sure how to write just one listener for just the currently selected level to open it's immediate child only, and then on clicking one of it's child items, then expand those. Any thoughts?
[08:25:42] <jeturcotte> inside a module, so this is the current element
[08:26:05] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Hah! try tabIndex
[08:26:29] <jeturcotte> if that were the case you'd expect the p-tag wouldn't work either
[08:26:36] <jeturcotte> though i can obviously try
[08:27:00] <pachet> hugo_moss: heh, i've hit that one my fair share of times
[08:29:58] <jeturcotte> i need to use git a lot more… i fumble my way through it every time
[08:30:39] <Stephen> jeturcotte: go check this
[08:30:40] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/
[08:30:52] <Stephen> When it loads, is the text "Me" green?
[08:31:01] <jeturcotte> aye
[08:31:03] <jeturcotte> even in safari
[08:31:22] <jeturcotte> neat site, btw… that oculd be useful
[08:32:40] <jeturcotte> i have to find it via this.children('em')
[08:32:53] <jeturcotte> but since tabindex DOES get applied to the em after it is created, i know that it found it okay
[08:32:54] <Stephen> ??
[08:33:22] <Stephen> Can you paste your code in a  new jsfiddle so I can take a look?
[08:33:28] <jeturcotte> because the code that facilitates typing is going some from the perspective of the jQuery context for that particular p tag… so it knows itself as 'this'
[08:33:28] <Stephen> Also, check this one:
[08:33:29] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/1/
[08:33:41] <Stephen> I put your conditional into my code, it still seems to work fine
[08:34:03] <jeturcotte> it'll take a few, but i'll poke at it
[08:34:29] <jeturcotte> can this facilitate jQuery modules
[08:35:10] <Stephen> You'd have to paste them, but don't worry about that
[08:35:51] <Stephen> just get me at least the function scope where the focus() gets called, and as much of the HTML and Styles you can provide
[08:36:11] <Stephen> No need to go rummaging through linked files
[08:38:46] <jeturcotte> nice
[08:41:01] <Stephen> hmm.. this.children("em") would return an array of elements
[08:41:10] <Stephen> so if :
[08:41:16] <jeturcotte> yeah thogugh this will only allow one em to exist at any time
[08:41:28] <Stephen> var ems = this.children("em");
[08:41:32] <jeturcotte> the fact that it gets tabindex when .typehere() is called on it shows that it found the element okay
[08:41:36] <Stephen> then you shoud be doing:
[08:42:33] <Stephen> $.each(ems, function() {if(this.attr('tabindex')){  this.focus(); } else { this.attr('tabindex', 100); this.focus(); });
[08:42:34] <pallet> hi people, http://pastebin.com/JigZbnDZ this is working, but there's got to be a better solution than repeating the code
[08:42:41] <pallet> please help ;)
[08:42:55] <Stephen> or at least be sure that you are referencing [0] when setting the attr
[08:43:26] <vedic> Hello friends, is there any way to convert query string of type: ?k=+consulting&rates%5Brate30min%5D=25&rates%5Brate30max%5D=150    to   ?k=consulting/rate30min=25/rate30max=150  and so on?
[08:43:45] <Stephen> Javascript encode() and decode()
[08:43:56] <jeturcotte> hm
[08:44:25] <vedic> or any thing similar which looks much prettier then using [] (which is shown as %5B)
[08:44:39] <Stephen> vedic: my mistake, decodeURI
[08:44:50] <jeturcotte> hope i didn't overwrite your thing, but: http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/2/
[08:45:08] <jeturcotte> now type a couple lines
[08:45:25] <jeturcotte> then hit Crtl-Z .. type more… then tab around till you get back to the em and you'll find you can type into it
[08:45:33] <jeturcotte> it got tabindex correctly, it just never gets focus
[08:46:44] <vedic> Stephen: Would that send the uri of ?k=+consulting&rates%5Brate30min%5D=25&rates%5Brate30max%5D=150 which is actually:  ?k=+consulting&rates[]rate30min=25&rates[]rate30max=150
[08:46:58] <Mottie> pallet: can you share your html please
[08:49:16] <Stephen> jet: I never see EM elements get created in the DOM
[08:49:19] <Stephen> jeturcotte
[08:49:29] <jeturcotte> i do
[08:49:46] <jeturcotte> and with their tabindex as well
[08:50:49] <jeturcotte> ltierally the only thing about this that isn't working is typehere()'s .focus() on a non-p
[08:51:11] <veganista> I've writing some JS for an application and have a question. Should i wrap all the functions up in a plugin that can be called on my ellement. For example, i haver a calculator that requires a couple of sliders, some inputs that can be used to set the sliders and some result boxes. It seems to make sense as then i avoid functions like calculateResult() and can call $('element').calculator('calcula
[08:51:12] <jeturcotte> (at least in webkit/safari)
[08:51:13] <veganista> te'). It seems a nicer approach to me as then i can use custom events easier and keep my code DRY
[08:51:27] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Well, let's see
[08:52:10] <Stephen> jeturcotte: can you try replacing .focus() with .click() and see if it behaves as you expect?
[08:53:44] <Stephen> jeturcotte: this.children('em:last').typehere(); is your problem
[08:53:58] <Stephen> .focus() can't be called on an array
[08:54:08] <jeturcotte> it may not be ideal, but that the em gets tabindex suggests it worked
[08:54:13] <Stephen> this.children() always returns an array
[08:54:19] <thaifood> hi
[08:54:24] <Stephen> setting properties on an array works
[08:54:32] <jeturcotte> so typehere() can be, but the focus inside cannot
[08:54:36] <Stephen> You can't give multiple objects focus
[08:54:45] <jeturcotte> naturally
[08:55:07] <jeturcotte> that the em gets tabindex gives the impression that it the result was good
[08:55:19] <thaifood> Is there a way for me to reliably simulate a click on an <h3 id="foo"> please ?
[08:55:21] <jeturcotte> but jquery may be making up by applying it to each array child
[08:55:32] <jeturcotte> so part works and part doesn't
[08:55:47] <thaifood> i have no luck with:  setTimeout(function() { $('#' + acc_cookie.substring(0,3) ).trigger('click'); }, 50);    or   jQuery('#' + acc_cookie.substring(0,3)).click();
[08:56:18] <jeturcotte> still no good
[08:56:40] <jeturcotte> in fact, now it fails to apply typehere at all
[08:57:02] <Stephen> jeturcotte: If you are using this.children("em:last"), It would be prudent to change it to this.children("em:last")[0].typehere()
[08:57:10] <jeturcotte> tried
[08:57:15] <jeturcotte> now it fails altogether
[08:57:18] <jeturcotte> instead only only one part
[08:57:27] <Stephen> Can you update the fiddle  for me right quick?
[08:58:13] <jeturcotte> http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/3/
[08:58:30] <jeturcotte> in /2/ you can tab your way to finding the empty <em>, but in /3/ you cannot
[08:58:37] <jeturcotte> which means not even the tabindex was applied to it
[08:59:09] <maxmoore14> gnarf: hey - a follow on question from the other day if you don't mind - when overriding _setOption(key, value) do I need to explicitly call this._super() or this._superApply(key, value) or will it just get called automatically?
[08:59:41] <jeturcotte> also tried var c = this.children('em'); c[0].typehere(); but same fail
[09:00:51] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Any errors in your browser JS console?
[09:01:02] <jeturcotte> note, if i were to do a this.after( … em … ) and this.next.typehere(); (as i do with the p tags successfully on key==13), it still will not accept focus
[09:01:32] <jeturcotte> not displayed here on jsfiddle, no… and the typing and creation/focus on new p tags still works happily
[09:01:44] <lejocelyn> hi
[09:06:02] <pachet> hi
[09:06:23] <Stephen> jeturcotte: When I run this fiddle, what I get is a single gray line waiting for me to enter text
[09:06:32] <jeturcotte> indeed
[09:06:36] <Stephen> I type something, hit enter, start typing again and I get another line
[09:06:43] <jeturcotte> so far so good
[09:06:47] <Stephen> When are the <em> elements supposed to be created?
[09:06:51] <jeturcotte> now hit ctrl-z and keep typing
[09:07:01] <jeturcotte> you'll probably see a mystery space created
[09:07:06] <jeturcotte> that's the em
[09:07:25] <jeturcotte> but you;ll notice the typing stays in the p tag… you can only type in the em if you tab your way through back to it
[09:07:39] <Stephen> Ah, ok
[09:07:41] <Stephen> one sec
[09:08:03] <jeturcotte> the idea is to be able to ctrlz one's way into and out of styling mode
[09:08:08] <jeturcotte> and to keep it separate from the parent
[09:08:09] <thaifood> Can anyone tell me why line 19 of my code is not triggering the click ?   Line 33 works fine though  http://fpaste.org/bOw5/
[09:08:44] <jeturcotte> kind of you, btw, to take such a long look at it
[09:10:23] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLElement> has no method 'typehere'
[09:10:45] <jeturcotte> not getting that
[09:11:02] <jeturcotte> oh maybe you're getting that on /3/
[09:11:10] <jeturcotte> i went back to /2/
[09:11:15] <jeturcotte> which still works except for focus
[09:13:13] <Stephen> jeturcotte: I think I got it
[09:13:27] <Stephen> this.children("em")[0] isn't a jquery object
[09:13:32] <Stephen> therefore, no impress
[09:13:34] <Mottie> thaifood: can you set up a demo please
[09:13:40] <lejocelyn> hey guys, I've beginning with Jquery, I try to make a script that would add a input form if I click on a button but, it doesn't work. Can you look at this snippet ? http://pastebin.fr/26429 ?
[09:13:54] <Stephen> er, no typehere
[09:13:56] <jeturcotte> but this.children('em') IS, but as an array the tabindex works while the focus does not
[09:14:06] <Stephen> jeturcotte $(this.children("em")[0]).typehere()
[09:14:20] <jeturcotte> <trying></trying>
[09:14:30] <thaifood> mottie, no, i wish i could,  i am simply using the jquery ui accordion and trying to simulate clicking on one of the nodes as my page loads
[09:14:57] <jeturcotte> naw
[09:14:59] <thaifood> now i'm digging into the ui code for the accordion thinking in can call a function instead
[09:15:15] <jeturcotte> $(this.children('em')[0]).typehere(); is sufficient to tabindex again, but it still refuses focus
[09:15:18] <dblosevn> Stephen: think you meant $(this).find('em').eq(0).typehere();
[09:15:41] <Mottie> thaifood, the reason I asked is because it seems like a lot of id's are being used. I wonder if any are duplicated? or what do you see in the console.log's that you have in there.
[09:15:52] <jeturcotte> dblosevn this in this context, but maybe
[09:16:00] <dblosevn> wont fatal if the element is not found
[09:16:07] <thaifood> none are duplicated, i have uniquelly named them a01, a02 etc...
[09:16:29] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Hmm, it always hits the .after() section
[09:16:43] <thaifood> this is my accordion  http://fpaste.org/Rube/
[09:16:56] <jeturcotte> hmmmm
[09:17:02] <jeturcotte> maybe then it's going to em and then immediately leaving it
[09:17:05] <jeturcotte> well no
[09:17:12] <jeturcotte> because the p parent is not after the em
[09:17:12] <Mottie> lejocelyn: that code will add an input after the image every time you click it. It would be better to already have a hidden input in place and reveal it when the image is clicked
[09:17:44] <jeturcotte> btw, same result on http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/5/ (with this.find('em').eq(0).typehere();) ...
[09:18:02] <Mottie> thaifood: which click isn't working?
[09:18:02] <jeturcotte> it sets tabindex (saying that typehere fired) but focus is refused
[09:18:25] <thaifood> setTimeout(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); }, 50);  on line 19
[09:18:25] <vedic> Is there way to make GET url query string looks prettier? I know decodeURI method. Anything else? something that removes [] and & to = and /
[09:18:48] <lejocelyn> Mottie: but, I can need a lot of new input :(
[09:18:51] <Mottie> thaifood: does acc_cookie.length ever === 3?
[09:19:12] <thaifood> yeah it's in that loop for sure
[09:19:40] <Mottie> thaifood: I don't see a loop
[09:19:42] <thaifood> what's odd is that if i create a button and click it, my listener works with the same code
[09:19:48] <jeturcotte> so far, i've had the same result from this.children('em').typehere(), this.find('em').eq(0).typehere(), and $(this.children('em')[0]).typehere()…. all fire correctly but refuse focus
[09:19:54] <thaifood> line 33 http://fpaste.org/bOw5/
[09:20:02] <Mottie> lejocelyn: can you set up a demo?
[09:20:28] <Stephen> jeturcotte: got it!
[09:20:28] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/6/
[09:20:40] <Mottie> thaifood: ok let me ask this... where is the listener on #a01?
[09:20:40] <Stephen> Check out the changes
[09:20:51] <Stephen> It types the text inside the EM now
[09:21:09] <vedic> Is there way to make GET url query string looks prettier? I know decodeURI method. Anything else? something that removes [] and & to = and /
[09:21:29] <Stephen> inside typehere(), when doing this.focus(), you need to be using this[0].focus()
[09:21:29] <jeturcotte> nice...
[09:21:31] <jeturcotte> but why
[09:21:36] <thaifood> Mottie,  there isn't one,  I'm saving the ID in a cookie and on page reload loading the cooking back and and telling jQuery to click it,  Since there is no listener that's probably why it doesn't work ?
[09:21:49] <Stephen> Like I was saying, you are passing an array to typehere, not a single element
[09:21:54] <thaifood> s/cooking/cookie
[09:21:57] <jeturcotte> woot
[09:22:14] <jeturcotte> on a side note, does Stephen++ do anything in irc context?
[09:22:26] <Stephen> Nope, not here
[09:22:29] <jeturcotte> i see people do it from time to time; emulating but not sure why
[09:22:39] <Stephen> Just visit my game sometime: http://nova-initia.com
[09:22:50] <jeturcotte> many thanks by the way
[09:22:54] <Stephen> or hit up our irc chan: irc.nova-initia.com #nova-initia
[09:22:58] <jeturcotte> i'll have to parse this a bit, but it's a big deal to me =3
[09:23:00] <Stephen> Not a prob
[09:23:10] <jeturcotte> bookmarked
[09:23:16] <jeturcotte> (nova initia that is)
[09:23:17] <Mottie> thaifood: do the console logs show anything? line 26 & 28
[09:23:41] <thaifood> yeah they show the correct values for the id that i click
[09:23:43] <Stephen> just remember, children() returns an array, even if it's just one.
[09:23:53] <jeturcotte> i believe it
[09:23:57] <thaifood> and the cookie is retreived correctly too
[09:24:14] <jeturcotte> i think that the attr() was happy to work with an array which is why it was a half false-positive
[09:24:29] <thaifood> so maybe jQuery can't simulate a click if there is no listener on the element
[09:24:37] <thaifood> i wonder if there is another way
[09:24:38] <Stephen> jeturcotte: Yes, attr will always work on arrays, it's convenient like that
[09:24:47] <jeturcotte> *bow*
[09:24:51] <Stephen> thaifood: Yes it can
[09:25:08] <thaifood> hmm, then i'm stuck why i can't get it to play along
[09:25:30] <thaifood> stephen, line 19 won't work for me   http://fpaste.org/bOw5/
[09:26:03] <Stephen> thaifood: look up jquery's trigger function
[09:26:23] <thaifood> what about it
[09:26:33] <Stephen> You can call an events handler without the actual event happening
[09:26:46] <thaifood> so why doesn't line 19 click it
[09:27:10] <jeturcotte> heh, now i have to fix it up so styling mode actually exits
[09:27:15] <jakul> hi guys. i'm wondering if anyone can help me find a jquery site-tour plugin? i don't want one that shows popup boxes, instead I want a single overlay with curvy arrows that point to the releavant parts of the page.
[09:27:18] <jeturcotte> (to do later), food times
[09:28:25] <Stephen> thaifood: I see, no handler. What are you expecting to happen?
[09:28:33] <vedic> Is there way to make GET url query string looks prettier? I know decodeURI method. Anything else? something that removes [] and & symbols and provide = and /   . More REST like url?
[09:28:53] <thaifood> on page load i want it to click the accordion <h3 id="a01">
[09:29:00] <Mottie> Stephen: the #accordion will see the event from bubbling up
[09:29:16] <Stephen> ah
[09:29:42] <xiphiasx_> any idea on how to create a widget on uh
[09:29:42] <xiphiasx_> jquery mobile
[09:29:43] <Stephen> #(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); });
[09:29:57] <Stephen> thaifood: set line 19 to that
[09:30:04] <thaifood> k
[09:30:18] <mhn23_> i like thai food
[09:31:21] <Stephen> thaifood: Your entire script is wrapped in $().ready, why are you using setTimeout??
[09:31:49] <thaifood> i thought it was a timing issue
[09:32:12] <Stephen> thaifood: Lastly, I'd move your entire script block to be AFTER the body tag, if it isn't there already
[09:32:13] <thaifood> i get illegal character #   with   #(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); });
[09:32:26] <Stephen> That should be $(function
[09:32:31] <Stephen> not #(function
[09:32:36] <Stephen> My bad
[09:32:55] <thaifood> k
[09:33:35] <Stephen> thaifood: Note that trigger() doesn't actually click the dom element.
[09:33:42] <thaifood> ahh it was just above the body tag, now it's below
[09:33:47] <Stephen> Which means the event doesn't get propagated through the dom
[09:34:00] <Mottie> thaifood: I still think that acc_cookie is never = 3
[09:34:12] <thaifood> actually it's 3, i check
[09:34:42] <Stephen> thaifood: I'd do yourself a small favor and remove the if clause regarding the cookie while you test this.
[09:34:48] <Mottie> thaifood: document.cookie ="sdbcookie1=" + event.target.id; ... it'll never add more than one
[09:34:49] <lejocelyn> Mottie: set up a demo ? don't have yet the serveur online
[09:34:59] <lejocelyn> the code doesn't work though
[09:35:07] <thaifood> i just enabled the  console.log('triggered #' + acc_cookie.substring(0,3));
[09:35:08] <Mottie> lejocelyn: use jsFiddle or jsBin
[09:35:11] <Stephen> thaifood: Also, sorry, trigger does actually click
[09:35:11] <thaifood> and it's showing the value
[09:35:17] <Stephen> triggerHandler does not
[09:35:23] <thaifood> Mottie,  yeah i only want one
[09:35:26] <Mottie> lehocelyn: http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:35:36] <thaifood> no luck with   $(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); });
[09:35:41] <Mottie> thaifood: so if(acc_cookie.length == 3){ will always be false
[09:36:16] <Stephen> thaifood: Can you comment out lines 16,17, and 20 and see if it works?
[09:36:20] <lejocelyn> I didn't know that
[09:36:39] <thaifood> i removed the entire if and just have    $(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); });
[09:37:49] <Stephen> thaifood: Also, can I ask why you are using .trigger('click') and not .click()?
[09:38:18] <thaifood> i will use whatever you tell me will work :-)
[09:38:35] <Stephen> So, removing the if didn't help?
[09:39:00] <thaifood> correct, now i'm down to this code   http://fpaste.org/9YO7/
[09:39:08] <Stephen> If not, are you use that $('#a01") exists?
[09:39:19] <thaifood> yes i even test that it exists
[09:39:29] <Stephen> try this line:
[09:39:37] <thaifood> if ($('#a01').length > 0) {alert("exists"); }
[09:40:03] <Stephen> what type of element is #a01?
[09:40:08] <thaifood> <h3>
[09:40:20] <thaifood> from the jQuery UI Accordion
[09:40:31] <dblosevn> grr
[09:40:41] <Stephen> ok, is line 19 still how I wrote it, or did you go back to the setTimeout?
[09:40:54] <dblosevn> is there a way to force something to render in a hidden div?
[09:41:07] <lejocelyn> Mottie: here
[09:41:11] <lejocelyn> http://jsfiddle.net/FN88m/
[09:41:12] <thaifood> 19 is how you wrote it   this is my accordion http://fpaste.org/pwUk/
[09:41:48] <dblosevn> i have a ui-tab view with 2 ext grids both grids work but the one thats not visible doesnt quite render properly
[09:42:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What's the unsigned int value of -84897?
[09:42:27] <dblosevn> 84897 lol
[09:42:27] <Chuwiey> Hi all, when does it make sense to create a jquery plugin as opposed to just another object that uses jquery... ?
[09:42:33] <Stephen> thaifood: Have you checked with your browser console to make sure that a01 isn't getting renamed after the grid renders?
[09:42:55] <thaifood> right, it's id stays a01 in firebug inspector
[09:43:15] <thaifood> weird huh
[09:43:21] <Stephen> great, and clicking on the H3 is what expands the accordion?
[09:43:26] <thaifood> yes it is
[09:43:48] <Stephen> ah, I see
[09:44:08] <thaifood> so to save the state of the accordion i save out the id to a cookie and bring it back
[09:44:15] <thaifood> thinking i can simulate the click
[09:44:22] <Stephen> thaifood: it could be a face condition
[09:44:33] <thaifood> so i used settimeout for that possibility
[09:44:39] <thaifood> even 1000 changes nothing with it though
[09:44:44] <Mottie> lejocelyn: oh, remove "function addInput(){"... it's causing an error
[09:45:13] <Stephen> thaifood: does this accordion have any events which you can hook?
[09:45:17] <lejocelyn> lejocelyn: but, isn't it the base of my script ?
[09:45:48] <Stephen> thaifood: I'd have function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); } run in it's loaded event or something if you could
[09:46:01] <Mottie> thaifood: the getCookieValue is only run when the dom is ready, so because the initial accordion is panel 0, it just opens the same panel
[09:46:06] <thaifood> Stephen,  it's working for other values, just not a01
[09:46:35] <Mottie> lejocelyn: if it is, it needs a closing "}", then you'll need to initialize it
[09:47:24] <thaifood> i got it !
[09:47:31] <Chuwiey> Hi all, when does it make sense to create a jquery plugin as opposed to just another object that uses jquery... ?
[09:47:38] <Stephen> did you put it in the create: event?
[09:47:40] <Mottie> lejocelyn: whenever you have code that doesn't work, open up the javascript console (F12), or paste your code into jsHint (http://jshint.org/) to help find the problem
[09:47:43] <thaifood> if it's the first accordion, i have to trigger it twice:     $(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); });
[09:47:43] <thaifood>     $(function() { $('#a01' ).trigger('click'); });
[09:48:02] <thaifood> go figure ?
[09:48:08] <Stephen> thaifood: because it doesn't have focus
[09:48:09] <Stephen> I see
[09:48:12] <Stephen> I'
[09:48:12] <Brodingo> trigger is typically for custom or multiple events
[09:48:14] <Mottie> thaifood: it would be better to use the header option
[09:48:16] <Brodingo> .click() is the same
[09:48:21] <thaifood> what is a header option ?
[09:48:26] <Mottie> errr active
[09:48:28] <Brodingo> just fyi
[09:48:45] <Mottie> thaifood: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[09:48:47] <thaifood> oh see if it's active first ?
[09:48:53] <Stephen> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[09:49:03] <Stephen> No, there is an option to set the active panel
[09:49:12] <thaifood> oh craptastic !
[09:49:12] <Mottie> thaifood: no, you can set which accordion panel is active by adding the index there
[09:49:22] <thaifood> thanks so much guys, i'm back in the race
[09:49:29] <Stephen> Documentation is your friend :-)
[09:49:34] <thaifood> free spring rolls for everyone :-)
[09:49:42] <Stephen> I'm holding you to that
[09:49:43] <Mottie> thaifood: active: getCookieValue("sdbcookie1")

[09:49:51] <thaifood> yes !
[09:49:54] <thaifood> thanks again

[09:54:43] <lejocelyn> Mottie: it doesn't work for me :(
[09:55:25] <Mottie> lejocelyn: where should the input be added?, inside the form or inside the button?
[09:55:38] <lejocelyn> :D
[09:55:42] <lejocelyn> inside the form

[10:04:04] <Nancy2012> ??
[10:04:18] <Nancy2012> is it posibles vía json??
[10:04:25] <gates> its the only way
[10:04:27] <Ziggy`> Nancy2012: You need to send the data to the server..
[10:04:37] <gates> oh yeah its ajax, wow sorry
[10:04:43] <gates> listen to Ziggy`
[10:04:47] <ericandrewlewis> does anyone else notice the jquery ui accordion seems a bit outdated? is there an alternative more dev friendly one i should be using?
[10:05:39] <Mottie> ericandrewlewis: what do you mean outdated? And there are some pure css accordions out there is you want.
[10:06:16] <ericandrewlewis> Mottie: for example, it only allows for one section to be open at a time
[10:06:40] <ericandrewlewis> and i'd love recommendations if you have any for a more full-featured accordion library
[10:06:51] <jrajav> That's kind of what an accordion is
[10:07:00] <jrajav> It's more of a "wizard" type interface
[10:07:08] <jrajav> You may just want distinct slide-open elements
[10:07:19] <Mottie> ericandrewlewis: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-collapsible
[10:07:44] <mg983> Hullo
[10:08:29] <mg983> Is there any way to get the number of lines of text are in a div? for example http://jsfiddle.net/EyEJp/ to return for the first box 3 and second 6...
[10:08:44] <ericandrewlewis> Mottie: that option only allows you to close all panels at once, not open multiple at once
[10:09:03] <Geekle> is that someone can correct my code I can not make it work  http://jsfiddle.net/KsQ3P/12/
[10:09:27] <ericandrewlewis> jrajav: yeah, i think that might be the way I'll have to go. it makes more sense that would be a function of the a single library
[10:10:36] <ericandrewlewis> i guess i can just create a simple effect with slideDown and slideUp onclick

[10:17:06] <grafi> pallet i dont think thats possible
[10:17:10] <Geekle> grafi ok, by which I can replace this procedure?
[10:17:16] <pallet> grafi, thought so
[10:17:28] <asker> hello everyone
[10:19:16] <grafi> Geekle, first of all marginleft is not a defined variable ... so thats gotta change
[10:19:23] <Geekle> grafi possible but I do not think you do me fix this code?
[10:19:24] <asker> does anyone here have time to help me with probably a very trivial problem please?
[10:20:03] <grafi> just ask asker ;)
[10:20:08] <asker> ok thanks
[10:20:17] <asker> i have this piece of code http://pastebin.com/vwzXTmYR
[10:20:35] <shoky> Geekle: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KsQ3P/13/
[10:20:44] <asker> and for some reason it keeps changing the background to p4.jpg instead of p1.jpg, p2.jpg...
[10:21:43] <royalty> hello
[10:22:26] <grafi> asker my guess would be you just get to see the final state ...
[10:22:53] <asker> but shouldnt the loop go through all the stages before it gets to the final state?
[10:23:29] <Mottie> ericandrewlewis: here is a basic example: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/58LBP/
[10:23:54] <ericandrewlewis> Mottie: yeah that's the direction i'm gonna go in. thanks!
[10:24:00] <Mottie> ok
[10:24:18] <shoky> asker:  by the time the fadeOut callback is called,  the loop is already long gone, so photo is 4
[10:24:29] <shoky> asker:  http://pastebin.com/frM0YHeS
[10:25:10] <Geekle> shiky you're big boss jquery ;)
[10:25:40] <Geekle> shoky you're big boss jquery ;)
[10:25:49] <shoky> asker: this will also work if you want to keep the while loop.. http://pastebin.com/WdmMXtfy
[10:26:11] <shoky> Geekle: ;]
[10:26:19] <asker> shoky: thanks in advance (im still trying it all :) )
[10:26:35] <grafi> shoky can you tell me why your while version would work?
[10:26:52] <Geekle> shoky:  we are a small organization who rides a French social network project, we seek a ajax coder for this project with contract and pay. Are you interested?
[10:27:21] <shoky> grafi:  because of the nested function (an IIFE - immediately invoked),
[10:27:48] <shoky> grafi: because there's a function, it creates a new inner scope, with its own local copy of the photo variable
[10:28:00] <shoky> grafi: so in the nested function the photo value wont change
[10:28:09] <mr_pinc> Anyone have a good example of an integrated video app.  So for example your app loads with a still image of an environment and 3 hotspots that you can click on,  depending on which location you select it plays a different video with the camera flying to a new location, when the camera arrives a different piece of content loads and that might have some mild interactivity
[10:28:21] <grafi> ah i see, thank you very much shoky
[10:28:25] <mr_pinc> we createa  lot of these types of applications in flash currently but we want to explore HTML5 but we want to say what we can do / how much effort is it
[10:28:34] <shoky> Geekle: not currently, sorry ;]
[10:28:36] <ericandrewlewis> does anyone notice not totally smooth element collapsing with hide() and show() ?
[10:28:57] <ericandrewlewis> here's my example: http://bundletechnologies.com/themcwell/sermon/12/ click audio or video a little ways down the page
[10:29:41] <ericandrewlewis> there's minor hiccups that happen at the beginning and end of the event
[10:29:50] <awc737> can anyone recommend a minimalist framework to get good MVC structure, but not for a full fledged single page JS app?
[10:30:53] <Geekle> shoky have you email  for help me ?
[10:31:02] <asker> shoky: your while version seems to work, thanks!
[10:31:17] <asker> shoky: one question though, what does the (photo) after the while cycle mean?
[10:31:40] <shoky> Geekle: i answered your PM
[10:31:45] <ericandrewlewis> awc737 not exactly a jquery related question, you might get more answers in #javascript. that being said, i'm partial to backbone.js
[10:31:48] <dcherman> awc737: Backbone is as minimalist as it gets.
[10:32:35] <shoky> asker:  it passes the outer photo var into the nested function call as first argument
[10:33:31] <Mottie> ericandrewlewis: I think that's the padding... try setting the padding/margin of the animated element to zero, then add the padding/margin to an element inside
[10:33:33] <shoky> asker:  it's more clear like this:  http://pastebin.com/aWLSZhmf
[10:34:34] <asker> shoky: so the function(photo) sets up a variable inside a function called "photo" and the (photo) after it defines the inner "photo" variable as outer "photo" variable?
[10:34:50] <shoky> asker: and it is equivalent to this:  http://pastebin.com/40uztDjf
[10:35:24] <shoky> asker:  it does exactly what i'm doing "manually" in the last paste
[10:35:42] <asker> shoky: i see
[10:35:48] <shoky> well, not exact, but same result
[10:36:04] <royalty> does anyone have any experience with the jquery validator plug in
[10:36:18] <asker> well thank you shoky, your advice is very helpful!
[10:36:28] <shoky> np
[10:46:32] <Alex___> Hey guys, I've a problem with popover(), If I've my form outside my popover my ajax is working properly but once I've my form inside my popover my ajax stop working as it used to
[10:48:45] <royalty> how do i put jquery in noconflict mode again
[10:49:02] <royalty> can i replace $ with jQuery?
[10:50:18] <royalty> i think i can
[10:53:49] <Jon471> i believe in you
[10:58:17] <Gho5t> you can do anything if you set your mind to it
[11:00:21] <royalty> it worked guys
[11:00:25] <royalty> I couldnt' have done it without you
[11:00:31] <royalty> <3
[11:01:36] <royalty> could someont help me understand this: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/required#dependency-expression
[11:02:02] <royalty> i simply want to test if a box has a certain string and if it does then don't allow it to validate
[11:03:05] <royalty> I am really unfamiliar with those selectors #filled and #visible and whatever
[11:03:47] <royalty> actually that function doesn't allow what i want
[11:03:48] <royalty> hmmmm
[11:07:48] <jrajav> Is there an API spec with links to the source code?
[11:09:11] <eaz> API: http://api.jquery.com/
[11:09:14] <eaz> Source Code: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[11:09:17] <eaz> control-f
[11:09:21] <eaz> type in function name
[11:09:24] <jrajav> So no.
[11:09:33] <jrajav> I could have sworn I remembered something like that
[11:09:47] <eaz> i've never seen anything like with jquery
[11:09:57] <jrajav> Ctrl-F is a bit hard because I'm searching for the "text" method
[11:10:04] <jrajav> And I'm not familiar with the source tree at all
[11:10:05] <mythril> jquerymobile: is there a straight forward way to create an inline icon? (not a button, just an icon)
[11:11:01] <eaz> etText = Sizzle.getText = function( elem ) {
[11:11:11] <eaz> ** getText = Sizzle.getText = function( elem ) {
[11:11:27] <eaz> and there is this line
[11:11:28] <eaz> jQuery.text = Sizzle.getText;
[11:11:35] <eaz> so i think that is what you're looking for
[11:11:46] <thaifood> I'm trying to use the jquery.cookie.js  functions but when i remove a cookie it's still there.  Does this make any sense?  http://fpaste.org/D9xV/   https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[11:11:58] <thaifood> And i want the cookie to be sitewide
[11:12:53] <jrajav> eaz: Thank you very much! But I actually meant the one that *sets* text - I'm looking for how jQuery handles setting text content
[11:13:06] <jrajav> Our project currently does el.innerText = el.textContent = s;
[11:13:11] <jrajav> Which seems redundant to me
[11:13:30] <jrajav> For our "htmlEncode" function
[11:14:02] <awc737> is it valid to have a <form> element without any action attribute? if you use AJAX to set the URL
[11:15:13] <eaz> i think that is just js not jquery
[11:15:50] <eaz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.textContent
[11:15:52] <eaz> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms533899(v=vs.85).aspx
[11:16:00] <jrajav> This? http://api.jquery.com/text/#text2
[11:16:07] <jrajav> Yes, I know that *ours* is just JS
[11:16:41] <jrajav> I meant that I just wanted to see how JS did the same thing we're doing - we support the same browsers and I would mostly trust jQuery to be doing it right
[11:17:01] <jrajav> We can't actually use jQuery because we're encoding strings for interpolation, not directly setting them on elements
[11:17:12] <eaz> that would be it
[11:17:28] <jrajav> ?
[11:17:29] <dcherman> jrajav: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L32-L38
[11:17:40] <jrajav> dcherman: Thank you!
[11:17:57] <jrajav> .createTextNode, eh?
[11:18:15] <jrajav> Hmm. That's probably more efficient than creating a div and setting its textContent
[11:19:07] <jrajav> Is there a reason it must be appended to the document instead of just created standalone?
[11:19:35] <wolfehr> is there a traversal method for finding a parent, but we don't know how many levels up?
[11:19:43] <wolfehr> firstParent() or something
[11:19:44] <jrajav> Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding that chain. It seems to just be retrieving the document object to call createTextNode
[11:20:12] <dcherman> jrajav: it's not appended to the document, it's doing ownerDocument.createTextNode || document.createTextNode
[11:20:13] <Armistice> how would you have a background fadeIn to another background? $(this).animate({backgroundColor : "#4480A8"});
[11:20:16] <Armistice> doesn't seem to work
[11:20:19] <Armistice> it doesn't even change it
[11:20:49] <jrajav> dcherman: Yeah, I managed to misunderstand it twice in a row. this.empty().append( is on the element being acted on, not the document.
[11:21:08] <wolfehr> parents() seems to do it....
[11:21:26] <jrajav> So the way to go to duplicate it in vanilla JS would be: document.createTextNode(str).textContent;
[11:23:13] <dcherman> jrajav: no, there's a difference between textContent and innerText whitespace wise - your method won't be cross browser consistent.  why don't you want to just use $ functions?
[11:23:39] <jrajav> Is there a $ function for simply HTML-encoding some string?
[11:24:32] <jrajav> And perhaps cross-browser consistency is why our code currently does el.innerText = el.textContent = s;
[11:24:38] <jrajav> Where el is a throwaway div
[11:25:22] <cheshair> HI! I have a form with a jquery UI datepicker. I need it to display the date with format 'dd/mm/yy' but i need my form to return a date with format 'yyyymmdd'. Do you have any tips on how to achieve this?
[11:26:10] <cheshair> i am aware that dateFormat option can format the date, but i need two different formats for displaying and form purposes
[11:27:09] <dcherman> jrajav: nothing builtin, but you can simulate it via $( "<div>" ).text( htmlToEncode ).html()  .  if you use underscore/lodash, you can use _.escape
[11:28:26] <eaz> cheshair, why not use dateFormat with two formats?
[11:30:17] <cheshair> eaz: i am afraid i can't get you
[11:30:37] <jrajav> I see that lodash's _.escape simply does a string replace, precisely what I'm doing (precisely!) in a different function that I called htmlAttrEscape
[11:30:38] <cheshair> eaz: how can i specify two formats?
[11:30:54] <jrajav> Since our existing htmlEncode did not properly handle escaping quote characters for insertion into HTML attributes
[11:31:04] <jrajav> But perhaps that replace function can take the place of htmlEncode, too
[11:31:07] <eaz> cheshair http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-dateFormat
[11:31:25] <jrajav> It would be nice, because we use this in many places and performance is a concern
[11:31:33] <eaz> you can specify your own pattern
[11:33:06] <cheshair> eaz: will i be able to show the user one format and send back another one as a GET variable?
[11:34:00] <eaz> i don't know, i'm not familiar with GET/POST methods
[11:34:09] <eaz> sorry
[11:34:34] <cheshair> eaz: ok ty very much, i'll give a look at jquery-dateFormat
[11:42:50] <royalty> is there a way to test via console on a website
[11:42:53] <royalty> if jquery is loaded
[11:43:08] <Alex___> Anyone knows why some ajax inside a popover doesn't work but works outside of the popover?
[11:43:46] <andrewSC> hi all
[11:43:51] <royalty> i mean
[11:43:54] <royalty> i am using firefox
[11:44:24] <royalty> if i enter something like $("#comment").css("background","black"); in console it doesn't work
[11:44:43] <NoiseEee> isn't it backgroundColor?
[11:44:54] <royalty> i think you can do both can't you?
[11:45:08] <yogurt_truck> css' background should't accept that
[11:45:35] <andrewSC> So I'm trying to do a form submission event and all of the logic to work with the form is in js--it doesn't need to post to anywhere/anything.  Even with e.preventDefaults(); I get a refresh of the page and i loose the form data.  Is there a way to prevent this/is there a way to bind a enter key event and click event elegantly?
[11:45:50] <royalty> the function or actual css?
[11:45:53] <yogurt_truck> royalty: if that command runs without errors then it seems you do have jQuery loaded, though
[11:46:21] <royalty> i do get an error though and I am sure i have jquery loaded I am just trying to debug something
[11:46:28] <royalty> and it is kind of annoying because I am using a plug in
[11:46:33] <yogurt_truck> royalty: and what's the error?
[11:46:55] <yogurt_truck> royalty: maybe you have jquery running in noConflict mode, and therefore isn't in the $ variable
[11:47:34] <NoiseEee> andrewSC: sounds like you likely have a JS error, tell your debugger to pause on all uncaught exceptions
[11:47:40] <andromedian> i want to toggle a div to show when i click something since i am noob with jqurey i found a code that works but it uses a hyperlink that you click it and shows the div. i added a text-indent:-9999px in order to hide the text. is there another way without the use of hyperlinks or text?
[11:47:46] <royalty> ohhhh
[11:47:50] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: will do
[11:47:56] <royalty> i think it is in noconflict mode
[11:48:18] <royalty> yogurt_truck: the error is [14:47:37.396] TypeError: $(...).css is not a function
[11:48:37] <yogurt_truck> royalty: you either don't have jQuery, or have it running in noConflict() mode, or aren't using a proper css selector, because the command ".css("background","black")" is perfectly acceptable
[11:48:48] <yogurt_truck> royalty: right, what does the jQuery variable have?
[11:49:15] <yogurt_truck> royalty: like, try jQuery("#comment").css("background","black")
[11:49:48] <royalty> it worked
[11:49:53] <royalty> hmmmm
[11:50:28] <royalty> my problem is i don't think this line jQuery("#comment").val() == "Leave a comment..."; is returning as intended
[11:51:17] <yogurt_truck> what is #comment?
[11:51:24] <yogurt_truck> an input with a value?
[11:51:27] <royalty> yeah
[11:51:29] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: I was selecting the wrong id in the js for the submit event
[11:51:29] <royalty> a textarea
[11:51:47] <NoiseEee> royalty: you should use <textarea placeholder='Leave a comment...'>
[11:52:00] <NoiseEee> royalty: no more need to fill up inputs with instructions/fake placeholders
[11:52:04] <yogurt_truck> royalty: you sure it isn't a placeholder text what you're seeing?
[11:52:23] <royalty> ohhhh
[11:52:31] <royalty> there is such a thing as placeholder text
[11:52:33] <royalty> oh wat
[11:52:38] <royalty> so the attribute is just placeholder
[11:52:39] <royalty> ???
[11:52:53] <eaz> this is how i do a console textarea http://jsfiddle.net/eazimmerman/QfBqf/
[11:53:12] <royalty> nah I tested what i wanted and it is working but it isn't working with this plug in as intended I'm sorry I'm not being specific
[11:53:20] <yogurt_truck> royalty: .val() will return the actual value of the "value" attribute, regardless of what the "placeholder" attribute has
[11:53:37] <royalty> so wait
[11:53:43] <royalty> hahahaha
[11:53:53] <royalty> okay let me try this placeholder thing because that is what i want i think
[11:54:50] <royalty> because what i was trying to do is use this plug in and say if the value of the box is this text i already put in
[11:54:52] <royalty> don't validate
[11:55:01] <royalty> and the text i put in was instructions
[11:55:14] <royalty> so hopefully this placeholder thing works like i think it will
[11:56:41] <royalty> ahhhh yessssss
[11:56:58] <royalty> NoiseEee: thank you sir
[11:57:07] <royalty> yogurt_truck: thank you as well
[12:23:52] <nirvisual> jquery.com is down?
[12:24:54] <nirvisual> nvm
[12:25:06] <mathijs_> it was down for a few seconds
[12:29:02] <katsh> if i use $.load() to append html, how do i target that html (ie, $('#some_div')
[12:29:26] <katsh> without putting the js code inside the callback
[12:29:55] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:30:02] <mathijs_> hi
[12:30:47] <rindolf> mathijs_: what's new?
[12:30:57] <Brodingo> katsh if you want to delegate events, use .on() otherwise you have to use the callback to manipulate it since it would be asynchronous
[12:31:16] <systemfault> katsh: "theurl selector"
[12:33:22] <John-Q> hi.. im wondering whats the difference of doing $(this).next().val(ui.item.id); and  $('#id_client').val(ui.item.id);
[12:34:30] <katsh> systemfault: what?
[12:34:34] <katsh> oh
[12:34:37] <katsh> got it
[12:34:56] <systemfault> katsh: In the url, you add a space then the selector you want
[12:34:57] <Brodingo> John-Q the first references some context then traverses to the next sibling, the other is a direct ID selector
[12:35:21] <Brodingo> John-Q val sets the input value to that variable
[12:38:16] <John-Q> Brodingo:  if i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/bV8rC/ both options are available to use ?
[12:38:57] <katsh> systemfault: and if i will also select elements inside that selector, should i just include them in the call too?
[12:39:07] <katsh> or just the topmost ill need?
[12:39:36] <systemfault> katsh: I'm not sure I understand your question
[12:40:36] <katsh> systemfault: say i do  $.load('someurl.html #someid')
[12:40:56] <katsh> ill then be able to do $('#someid').  but what if inside the #someid div, i have #someclass
[12:41:14] <katsh> should i do $.load('someurl.html #someid .someclass #someotherID')
[12:41:15] <katsh> etc
[12:41:19] <systemfault> Yeah
[12:41:23] <tvanover> I have a snippet of code that maintains the session data on the server by querying the current logged in user every 10 minutes.  It seems to work fine in FF and Chrome but IE throws an "object doesn't support this property or method" errors on line 3 character 3 and line 4 character 4 of http://jsfiddle.net/pSNe7/.  Am I missing or misstating something?  running jquery 1.9.1
[12:42:05] <systemfault> tvanover: .trim() is probably the problem
[12:42:22] <systemfault> And also the setTImeout
[12:42:37] <tvanover> what should I be using to trim whitespace and set a delay?
[12:42:51] <tvanover> in IE?
[12:43:31] <systemfault> tvanover: To trim, you can use jQuery like this $.trim(theString)
[12:43:39] <systemfault> As for setTimeout, the first argument is a function
[12:44:03] <tvanover> yes, check()
[12:44:14] <systemfault> tvanover: Function != Function call
[12:44:31] <systemfault> tvanover: Right now, you're sending to setTimeout the result of the check
[12:44:58] <systemfault> The same as if you did: var result = check(……); setTimeout(result, 6000000);
[12:45:04] <systemfault> Which is not good
[12:45:24] <systemfault> setTimeout(function() { check(data.trim(), data.trim()) }, 600000);  would work
[12:45:33] <tvanover> ah.
[12:46:48] <tvanover> how should I reform the trim to IE doesn't complain?  data = trim(data)?
[12:48:15] <mythril> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/listview.filter.js <- so I guess jQuery mobile listviews have no events
[12:48:24] <mythril> particularly for descending into nested lists
[12:50:07] <mathijs_> tvanover: $.trim(data) should work
[12:52:20] <loic84> Hi, i want to add an event handler on click, that triggers another event, but I'd like this event to be called after all the other click handler have executed, is there a way to ensure that?
[12:55:53] <tvanover> rock thanks folks
[12:57:07] <Gho5t> loic84: you can use a deferred but I believe those are only for asynchronous actions
[12:58:43] <dcherman2> Gho5t: how would you use a deferred to accomplish that?
[12:59:42] <Gho5t> dcherman2: I've never used one so if you're insunating that I'm wrong, then so be it
[12:59:59] <Gho5t> I said I thought they might be for only asynch tasks
[13:00:06] <Gho5t> if his are, then it would work
[13:01:01] <dcherman2> Gho5t: deferreds ( as they're implemented by jQuery at the moment ) aren't inherently async, so they'll work for either use case
[13:02:11] <Gho5t> so wouldn't there be a way to get them to work in this case
[13:02:49] <dcherman2> Gho5t: newp.  the last event handler would need to resolve the deferred, but in this case you may not know what handler is the last one.
[13:03:04] <dcherman2> at least as i understand it.
[13:03:46] <Gho5t> I guess we'd have to see his workflow a little more
[13:04:12] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone. Could someone tell me an easy way to change an <option> value (such as <option value="abcxyz">) based on the value itself, such that no other options are changed? Basically like a full text match of sorts...
[13:04:26] <Gho5t> inv3nt0r: eq
[13:04:51] <Gho5t> oh nvm
[13:04:53] <Gho5t> misread
[13:05:16] <inv3nt0r> Basically I just want a link to an internal web page to change to a link to a Google map for mobile users
[13:05:41] <Gho5t> something like: $('option[value="abcxyz"]').attr('value', 'http://abcxyz.com') ?
[13:06:04] <inv3nt0r> Gho5t: I'll give that a shot... Looks about right
[13:08:39] <inv3nt0r> Not quite working... But I think I know where I've gone wrong...
[13:09:16] <dcherman2> loic84: what are you trying to do that you need to trigger a seperate event?
[13:11:09] <loic84> dcherman2: a click event handler of which I have no control over adds an element to dom, I need to do something on that newly created element.
[13:12:20] <dcherman2> loic84: is that something just changing styles, binding events, etc..?  can you use plain CSS or event delegation?
[13:13:06] <inv3nt0r> Gho5t: Seems to work in jsfiddle... But not on my page. Blaah!
[13:13:29] <Gho5t> well something is off in your code I guess
[13:13:33] <Gho5t> maybe the option osm
[13:13:42] <Gho5t> *isn't there or you're not doing this in dom ready
[13:14:38] <loic84> dcherman2: well that event handler add rows to a form, and for each textarea I'd like to attach an instance of codemirror. Before I'd just monitor DOMNodeInserted but I'd like to switch to monitoring the click handler that adds the new row.
[13:14:41] <inv3nt0r> Gho5t: Ya... The console doesn't throw any error, I'm going to try running my script at the very bottom of the code... brb
[13:15:58] <loic84> dcherman2: obviously catching the click is easy, but not triggering my event after all the other clicks handler have ran (in particular the one that adds the new row).
[13:17:08] <loic84> i could add a callback on timeout but that's not exactly clean.
[13:17:33] <dcherman2> loic84: DOMNodeInserted is deprecated and seriously degrades performance - look into MutationObservers instead if you want to go that way ( depending on your target browser share )
[13:17:58] <dcherman2> loic84: you could do as you say and use setTimeout(function() {}, 0 ), but that's not very clean as you pointed out.
[13:18:15] <systemfault> I've never seen so far a legitimate use of the mutation events…
[13:18:36] <systemfault> Everyone I've seen looking for them have bad code and see them as a solution for their mess.
[13:19:39] <loic84> all I'd need is a way to know that all click other handlers have run, and check if my form has changed. but there's no obvious way for that right?
[13:22:01] <loic84> actually, if a click event handler, trigger another event, shouldn't that event be queued after the current click signal?
[13:22:06] <Raydiation> how does jquery animate height?
[13:22:10] <Raydiation> slideToggle
[13:23:04] <Raydiation> first set height to 0 & overflow hidden, then display: block then making gradually increasing the height?
[13:23:19] <Gho5t> that's prorpietary information
[13:39:12] <ipartuk> hey fellers, is there a way to use a selector [e.g.: $(java_var)] to select a js var announced earlier? (such as var java_var = 'text')...?
[13:40:01] <Gho5t> if java_var is a dom element sure
[13:40:24] <digitrig> Gho5t, unfortunately, I think it's probably just a string, or some json data...
[13:40:29] <Gho5t> heh
[13:44:10] <Foxhoundz> ipartuk, it can accept texts and objects
[13:44:23] <Foxhoundz> strings*
[13:44:56] <Gho5t> I guess my point was why wrap anything else
[13:51:24] <jrockjiggz> does this make sense?
[13:51:26] <jrockjiggz> $(document).off('click','.likeLink').on('click','.likeLink', function(e){});
[13:51:36] <jrockjiggz> it works.. just never thought it could be don
[13:53:05] <shoelessone> So, I thought that in jQuery 1.7 + "on" will handle watching for new DOM elements
[13:54:08] <shoelessone> Basically, the issue I'm running into is that I'm rebuilding a <ol> and want to bind the "click" event on the <li>
[13:54:45] <jrockjiggz> $('olParentThatNeverChanges').on('click','ol li', functin(){});
[13:54:46] <shoelessone> But, using $("#the-ol li").on('click', function(event){..... I loose my "binding" when I rebuild the <ol>
[13:55:16] <systemfault> shoelessone: .on has two forms.. look at jrockjiggz's example
[13:55:18] <shoelessone> jrockjiggz: makes sense... I guess I don't know much about how this works
[13:55:25] <shoelessone> systemfault: cool, thanks guys, makes sense
[13:55:55] <jrockjiggz> $('.item').on('click') is for a single binding, just like $('.item').click()
[13:56:24] <shoelessone> gotcha. Awesome, that's beautiful, thank you!
[14:05:54] <lanken> is it worthwhile to cache a jquery object as a variable?
[14:06:35] <lanken> say I've got a UI response which runs $("img.shiny").hide() and $("img.shiny").show() in response to user actions
[14:07:15] <lanken> I should be able to improve the ms response of these hide() and show() visuals if I save var shiny_images = $("img.shiny"); , right?
[14:07:31] <jrockjiggz> lanken: yes it helps
[14:08:11] <jrockjiggz> each $('item') is a query to the DOM
[14:08:18] <czytacz> I made an array of selectors ------- var tabrand = [$(".a1"), $(".b2"), $(".c4")] ----- and then removed divs from the document using remove() and loaded new ones using get and append. Is there a way to bind the array obects with these new elements or do I have to define a new array?
[14:09:51] <jrockjiggz> an idea $('.a1, .b2, .c4').find('div').remove().end().html('newDiv').find('div').on('click');
[14:10:01] <Gho5t> bam
[14:11:17] <Foxhoundz> for the love of god
[14:11:22] <Foxhoundz> don't put that all on one line
[14:11:53] <jrockjiggz> you would format the syntax accordingly
[14:12:00] <coldhead> Foxhoundz <3
[14:13:49] <John-Q> is jsfiddle server slow?
[14:17:31] <Foxhoundz> Works fine for me
[14:22:05] <John-Q> is there any way to avoid repeating the selected value in the select list http://jsfiddle.net/qR9SK/
[14:25:10] <jrockjiggz> John-Q: ?
[14:27:03] <John-Q> jrockjiggz:  i would like to show only Inter in the combo field but i dont want it in the list once you click it
[14:27:12] <John-Q> jrockjiggz:  lol make sense?

[14:33:23] <banister`movie> hi, i added a click event for an element via: $('#id').click(function() ...)   how do i remove that click event?
[14:33:38] <jrockjiggz> die('click')
[14:33:45] <banister`movie> thanks
[14:33:54] <Foxhoundz> unbind
[14:33:58] <jrockjiggz> ^^
[14:34:00] <John-Q> jrockjiggz:  thanks !
[14:34:00] <Foxhoundz> there's die now?
[14:34:12] <jrockjiggz> live() -> die()
[14:34:15] <jrockjiggz> on() -> off()
[14:34:18] <jrockjiggz> bind() -> unbind()
[14:34:23] <banister`movie> Foxhoundz: which, unbind or die?
[14:35:03] <Foxhoundz> unbind
[14:35:49] <banister`movie> thx
[14:36:14] <jrockjiggz> i stand corrected. i never use unbind()
[14:41:30] <lundy> anyone care to give me some feedback on www.lundy.me.uk ?? id like to know where to improve it
[14:45:12] <hot_saucerman> needs some marquee tags
[14:45:23] <lundy> :o
[14:45:28] <humans63> ciao
[14:45:34] <humans63> !lista
[14:45:47] <Foxhoundz> lundy: +1 for not making it responsive
[14:45:49] <Foxhoundz> seriously
[14:45:49] <humans63> !list
[14:47:09] <andromedian> what's wrong with a responsive website?
[14:47:16] <lundy> iv just got 1 page atm but wanted feedback on wot iv done just
[14:48:20] <andromedian> lundy, you can ask at #design
[14:48:37] <andromedian> althought your website looks kinda old with that design
[14:49:09] <Foxhoundz> andromedian: It's an idiotic approach to mobile web development someone in California came up with while sipping a 'Grande' Cappuccino in an upscale Starbucks. You're basically trying to fit content across three different mediums of communications that have three distinct modes of interaction.
[14:49:29] <Foxhoundz> frameworks like skeleton and boostrap have made it bearable
[14:49:35] <Foxhoundz> but the idea still sucks
[14:49:39] <Foxhoundz> just my two cents on it
[14:50:21] <lundy> andromedian, where could i improve the design
[14:51:10] <hot_saucerman> best way is to look around at what other people are doing to get ideas
[14:53:56] <Foxhoundz> lundy: try #css and #html as well
[14:54:11] <lundy> yeah i have :) thanks
[14:54:28] <lundy> still gotta add in jquery to the site lol
[14:54:37] <banister`movie> how do i get my js to do something if it just discovers a tag with #home exists when the page is loaded?
[14:56:45] <jrockjiggz> ?bbq @ banister`movie
[14:56:45] <bot-t> banister`movie, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[14:57:57] <banister`movie> jrockjiggz: why are you telling me this?
[14:58:13] <banister`movie> it seems the answer is just: if($('#home').length) { .. }
[14:58:44] <jrockjiggz> banister`movie: oh sorry, i thought you meant #home in the url.. lol
[14:58:52] <banister`movie> hehe
[14:58:53] <banister`movie> np
[15:05:36] <czytacz> jrockjiggz: unfortunatelly it doesn't work
[15:06:45] <czytacz> i need a way to reassign the selectors of loaded content AFTER it appears there
[15:09:03] <czytacz> loaded by AJAX ofc
[15:09:22] <czytacz> bac
[15:09:28] <czytacz> loaded by $.egt
[15:09:36] <czytacz> $.get

[15:36:12] <TnR> Also, Is is possible to removeClass() using *? (Ex: removeClass('label-*');
[15:36:37] <tw2113> try and see
[15:40:07] <owzim> is there a way to trigger a <select> to open via js?
[15:41:13] <naeluh> Hi
[15:43:18] <rrva> hi! if I have a an array of document elements x = [$("#a"),$("#b"),$("#c")[C], and an array y = [0,0,1], what is the most efficent way of calling .addClass for all elements x[i] which have y[i] == 1 and .removeClass for all elements x[i] which have y[i] == 0 ?
[15:43:48] <rrva> oops x is  [$("#a"),$("#b"),$("#c")]
[15:44:14] <naeluh> I am trying to use the zoom plugin - http://janne.aukia.com/zoomooz/ - with a scale and show one the div has been clicked but I am getting some weird stuff happening it cause my other picture and text to disappear and just runs the zoom plugin here is my jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/DWA4a/

[15:48:11] <cheshair> Hi! I am using jquery UI date picker for a form. I need two different date formats for the date shown in the form and for the one which is sent back as a GET variable. Eg, the user is shown "3 jan 2013" and behind-the-scene the variable is "20130103". Any tips?
[15:49:04] <jrockjiggz> cheshair: you can have a hidden input, and have {onSelect: function(){ $('#hidden
[15:49:38] <rrva> owzim: http://jsfiddle.net/FVZkX/
[15:50:18] <owzim> rrva: awesome, thanks!
[15:52:20] <Alex___> Yeah guys, Do you have any ideas why AJAX is not working in a popover but works outside of it?
[15:52:24] <naeluh> for some reason the plugin isnt allowing my scale code to work anymore
[15:53:23] <cheshair> jrockjiggz: ehi thank you very much! that sounds interesting! a bit of a trick indeed...
[15:56:51] <cheshair> jrockjiggz: what about converting the form dates on the fly as soon as my "submit" button is pressed?
[16:00:42] <naeluh> its pretty weird ? I feel like this should work ?
[16:01:08] <naeluh> can some take a look at it if they have a sec thanks http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/DWA4a/
[16:08:54] <Chuwiey> can someone please tell me why this long-poll executes constantly and not every 15 secs like it should? http://jsfiddle.net/ambP3/
[16:09:09] <Chuwiey> or 60 secs
[16:28:00] <nesoi> so I have a .tap function defined on a UL and I can use event.target.id to get the ID of the LI that was tapped. That works fine. BUT I also have a .tap function defined on a regular DIV which contains buttons, and when I display the event.target.id of them, it's blank... any idea what I should be doing instead?
[16:30:05] <nesoi> hmm... the id is null
[16:33:10] <nesoi> hmm.. so why would the event.target.id be null? or should I access something else?
[16:35:01] <shoky> nesoi:  this.id   (or event.currentTarget.id)
[16:36:04] <shoky> er well, depends what yer doing exactly
[16:37:46] <nesoi> shoky : thanks... event.target.id works in the listview to return the li that was tapped, but it returns null in this case. event. currentTarget.id returns the id of the parent div rather than the button which was tapped, in the case I'm working on now
[16:37:56] <nesoi> while event.target.id returns null
[16:38:51] <nesoi> I don't understand how "this" context gets set so I haven't used it so far :)
[16:41:03] <shoky> nesoi: do the buttons have ids?
[16:41:15] <nesoi> yes!
[16:41:41] <shoky> nesoi: can you jsfiddle it
[16:42:20] <shoky> also, dont really know what that ".tap function" is
[16:42:31] <shoky> and if it bubbles normally or whatever
[16:43:33] <ryanseddon> does anyone know of a good interactive tutorial on $.ajax and friends for beginners?
[16:44:19] <ryanseddon> my team is learning about ajax and I find if I give them stuff to play with they'll pick it up quicker
[16:46:55] <coldhead> there was a reasonable one i used to teach a class that loaded pictures of cars but i can't find it now for the life of me >: |
[16:47:32] <coldhead> maybe dropbox to the rescue
[16:49:20] <coldhead> ryanseddon: http://www.jquery4u.com/function-demos/ajax/#
[16:49:25] <coldhead> looks like it's broken now >: |
[16:49:48] <ryanseddon> bummer thanks anyway coldhead
[16:50:00] <ryanseddon> i'm setting up some jsbin demos instead
[16:50:20] <ryanseddon> since you can create a bin that is just json data etc
[16:50:58] <nesoi> shoky : this.id is undefined
[16:51:21] <shoky> nesoi: and what is 'this'?  and how bout a jsfiddle
[16:51:45] <coldhead> ryanseddon: jquery4u has upgraded to 1.9.1 and they're still using live() is al
[16:51:48] <coldhead> all*
[16:51:50] <nesoi> I don't know how to set one up shoky
[16:51:52] <coldhead> poor bastards
[16:52:05] <shoky> nesoi:  what's this ".tap function" ?
[16:52:07] <ryanseddon> coldhead: tell them they're fired
[16:52:15] <shoky> nesoi: and.. at least pastebin your code then
[16:52:26] <Foxhoundz> hello jQ
[16:52:29] <coldhead> i'm sending them flowers to that effect
[16:52:31] <nesoi> .tap is from jquery mobile
[16:52:31] <Foxhoundz> I'm going to need your help for the next few hours
[16:54:18] <shoky> nesoi: show some code.. and console.log(this)
[16:55:38] <nesoi> console.log showed undefined when I logged it
[16:58:09] <nesoi> shoky: https://gist.github.com/rlad/72361735895f3e171932
[16:58:12] <nesoi> not sure how useful that will be
[16:58:18] <nesoi> it's a fragment showing what I'm trying to do
[17:00:41] <nesoi> shoky : so I create these buttons, and there is previously a bind on .tap for the enclosing div
[17:00:52] <nesoi> so when the button is tapped, the event is triggered
[17:01:00] <nesoi> now I need to get the id of what was tapped
[17:01:06] <nesoi> which works when I do it for a listview
[17:01:55] <nesoi> but in this case e.currentTarget.id is the ID of the surrounding div, and e.target.id is null
[17:01:56] <shoky> nesoi: welp e.target should work here
[17:02:04] <nesoi> it should huh?!?
[17:02:08] <nesoi> but it's null
[17:02:29] <nesoi> the console.log of the variable containing the HTML creating the buttons looks good to me
[17:02:42] <shoky> what does  $("#recipientsList").parent().trigger("create");    do?
[17:02:48] <shoky> (sorry, dont really know jqmobile)
[17:03:05] <nesoi> it makes the newly created elements actually render
[17:03:16] <nesoi> this is the log of some buttons which were created:
[17:03:28] <nesoi> <a href="#" data-role="button" data-mini="true" data-inline="true" id="b-943">A jose</a><a href="#" data-role="button" data-mini="true" data-inline="true" id="b-940">A Temp</a><a href="#" data-role="button" data-mini="true" data-inline="true" id="b-947">Aaron</a> at file:///android_asset/www/js/rl.js:134
[17:03:36] <shoky> oh ok its not inside the loop
[17:03:49] <nesoi> no, it's executed once
[17:03:57] <nesoi> I only do one .append and one create
[17:04:15] <nesoi> thinking that might be faster :)
[17:06:07] <oymyakon> Hello, does anybody know how to use jquery-mobile with bower? I can install the component but don't know that steps to follow after that.
[17:07:02] <nesoi> so why is it null?!?
[17:07:32] <skypce> hello guys
[17:07:46] <shoky> nesoi:  ah because jqmobile adds more elements inside the button
[17:07:47] <skypce> how can i add space with <span> tag in this code:$( "#amount" ).val( "" + $( "#slider-range" ).slider( "values", 0 ) +
[17:07:47] <skypce> 	"<span></span>" + "" + $( "#slider-range" ).slider( "values", 1 ) );
[17:08:26] <shoky> nesoi:  so its one of those extra elements (like a <span> with the button's text)  thats actually e.target
[17:08:33] <nesoi> shoky : but it should still have an .id
[17:08:34] <nesoi> oh
[17:08:38] <nesoi> grr
[17:08:47] <shoky> no it shouldn't
[17:09:03] <nesoi> how to figure that out??
[17:09:23] <shoky> use event delegation
[17:09:25] <shoky> sec
[17:12:13] <shoky> nesoi:  $('#recipientsList').on('tap', '.ui-btn', editRecipient);
[17:12:25] <shoky> nesoi:  and use this.id
[17:12:33] <shoky> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/AAenY/1/
[17:13:20] <shoky> if you want to use delegate instead of on  then:  $('#recipientsList').delegate('.ui-btn', 'tap', editRecipient);
[17:13:58] <Randuin> Is anyone using jquery mobile and backbone here?
[17:15:04] <nesoi> thanks shoky! What do those other 2 parameters do exactly and how did you determine it?
[17:16:09] <Chuwiey> can anyone tell me why the $('...').isotope(...) at the bottom isn't working? when i paste that into the console it loads without a problem... http://pastebin.com/q8NwEc9V
[17:16:23] <shoky> nesoi: that's how event delegation works.. you can read about it in the docs for .on()
[17:18:19] <shoky> nesoi:  and i used '.ui-btn'  just cause it was the first thing i saw that can identify the buttons. a custom class would be cleaner
[17:18:37] <nesoi> so what was really being tapped was <span class="ui-btn-text">bob</span> which has no ID, therefore null
[17:18:46] <shoky> yup
[17:20:00] <nesoi> so ui-btn is 2 elements higher, but the tap still registers on that? This stuff is still a bit magical for me
[17:20:04] <Chuwiey> anyone?
[17:20:24] <shoky> nesoi: events bubble up the dom
[17:20:40] <nesoi> ah ok
[17:21:03] <nesoi> cool, that's working! thanks so much. You probably saved me at least 3 gray hairs :)
[17:21:10] <shoky> ;]
[17:23:24] <shoky> nesoi: and regarding 'this',  with jquery events its usually equal to event.currentTarget
[17:24:55] <nesoi> ah ok
[17:25:13] <nesoi> but within what scope does 'this' stay valid?
[17:25:31] <shoky> within the event callback only
[17:25:38] <herdrick> is this the place to ask about the Quicksand plugin?
[17:26:11] <shoky> and if you call another function from inside, you will probably lose the 'this' unless
[17:26:23] <shoky> unless you put it back ;p
[17:26:58] <shoky> so i dont think your original way of calling another function from inside the event callback (for no reason)  would work with 'this'
[17:28:07] <nesoi> shoky : yeah, that's what I was guessing
[17:32:08] <herdrick> i want to change the default behavior of Quicksand animations.
[17:32:20] <herdrick> Normally new items just appear in place, and deleted items sort of wink out.  What I want is for the new items to bubble up from roughly the last item and the deleted items to drop down to there as well.
[17:33:40] <herdrick> I.e. I am animating a 'top 10' list, so I want the items which weren't already on the list to appear to have come from someplace after #10.  Likewise the deleted ones should fall off the list, appearing to drop to somewhere below position 10.
[17:34:00] <nitrix> Hi guys, I'm working on some kind of DOM canva drawing with your mouse. So far it uses mousemove. I'd like the normal click to draw, and the right click to erase.
[17:34:04] <oymyakon> hello, does anybody know how to use jquery mobile with bower?
[17:34:47] <nitrix> I managed to do the normal click by checking e.which==1, but cannot check the right click e.which==3... probably because the context menu opens and the events arnt sent
[17:35:37] <nitrix> How would I make my right-click-eraser work ?
[17:39:20] <nesoi> ok, on to the next problem!!
[17:39:58] <nitrix> It's pretty quiet in here.
[17:39:59] <shoky> nitrix:  .on('contextmenu', function(){return false;})
[17:41:43] <Raydiation> any idea why the click for the child a is not aborted? http://dpaste.org/B6FG7/#l12
[17:41:58] <Raydiation> jquery ui draggable
[17:42:12] <nitrix> shoky: solved. thanks!
[17:42:31] <Raydiation> does event.preventDefault also prevent clicks on childelements?
[17:42:40] <nitrix> Raydiation: one does not simply abort a child :/
[17:42:52] <nitrix> Raydiation: that was kinda nasty joke.
[17:42:57] <Raydiation> nitrix: i only abort the click
[17:43:07] <Raydiation> i need the child for gold farming
[17:43:17] <nitrix> lmao.
[17:43:23] <nitrix> Let me see
[17:43:48] <nitrix> that's mustache right?
[17:43:54] <Raydiation> coffeescript
[17:44:03] <nitrix> close enough.
[17:44:15] <shoky> Raydiation:  what kinda element is ui.helper? and what are you trying to prevent?
[17:44:15] <Raydiation> i can also paste the compiled js if you want to
[17:44:28] <nesoi> hmm... so in jquery mobile, if you want to create a popup it seems to want to find some <div> somewhere with the code in it already. But where would one put that div so it doesn't take up space in any page?
[17:44:28] <Raydiation> shoky: im dragging a li
[17:44:42] <Raydiation> the li has an <a> child with a click function
[17:44:54] <Raydiation> now when i drag the li, the child click is fired afterwards
[17:45:43] <Raydiation> shoky: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-start
[17:46:27] <Raydiation> second answer from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1771627/preventing-click-event-with-jquery-drag-and-drop
[17:46:46] <herdrick> nothing?  ok, i'll just hack up some one-off thing.
[17:46:57] <shoky> Raydiation: the start/stop events probably happens
[17:47:02] <shoky> Raydiation: sorry i gota go
[17:47:04] <shoky> bbs
[17:47:09] <nitrix> Raydiation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/947195/jquery-ui-sortable-how-can-i-cancel-the-click-event-on-an-item-thats-dragged
[17:47:51] <nesoi> bye shoky
[17:48:27] <nitrix> The reason being that ui.helper is null inside start and stop.
[17:50:09] <nitrix> Raydiation: the verdict?
[17:52:03] <nesoi> hm. so anyone here familiar with jquery mobile popups? I'm wondering if there's a way to create them dynamically like alert("text") rather than by putting a div somewhere in my html file
[17:52:58] <Raydiation> nitrix: had to adjust my style but it works quite well
[17:53:00] <Raydiation> ty
[17:53:09] <Raydiation> it also looks nicer i think
[17:56:42] <donCams> hope you can help me. wondering why my checkboxes are not checked after I added checked attr
[17:56:53] <donCams> not working in ff/chrome
[17:56:59] <donCams> or ie
[17:57:20] <oymyakon> hello, does anybody know how to use jquery mobile with bower?
[18:04:56] <nitrix> 30 mins later.
[18:05:11] <nitrix> Keep it up oymyakon; this channel is pretty dead.
[18:05:31] <oymyakon> nitrix, :D
[18:27:28] <nesoi> so in jquery mobile, is there a way to do something like alert()?
[18:33:23] <nesoi> hmm.. there seems to be an example here, but no source code http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/demos/popups/dynamic-popup.html
[18:34:17] <nesoi> hm. view source
[18:35:17] <nesoi> wow, that looks kind of complicated
[18:42:52] <relipse> is it possible to change a select2 box height? the item doesn't fit because of a big picture
[18:57:39] <GoSox> does $(this).siblings() include $(this) ?
[18:57:48] <relipse> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14824676/how-do-i-change-select2-box-height
[19:01:09] <GoSox> apparently not, which makes this a job for .parent().children()
[19:03:12] <nesoi> so if I want to have a popup which lets me delete an element on a page, what's the good way of doing that?
[19:06:06] <melfy> i'm using jquery to parseXML, modify a bit then print out, XMLSerializer doesnt understand passing it back! :( any ideas
[19:07:02] <nesoi> oops ttyl
[19:10:13] <ogk1000> any ideas why this each loop is overwriting the height values? http://collabedit.com/pp8sq
[19:10:28] <ogk1000> Maybe I need to use .data or something? it seems like the height only has 1 value vs the unqiue for all
[19:11:25] <Darbok> so...just ask question in the main room?
[19:11:43] <ogk1000> ya
[19:12:20] <Darbok> i downloaded the  .js file to install jquery.. i double clicked the file and got an error.. obviously i know i'm doing something wrong.
[19:13:07] <ogk1000> hmmm :(
[19:13:40] <Darbok> the jquery-1.9.1.js
[19:14:00] <Darbok> am i suppose to just double click on it and it should work?
[19:15:21] <ogk1000> define work
[19:16:12] <dcherman> Darbok: you don't double click it, you put it in a script tag in your HTML.  you should probably give http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/ a read
[19:20:02] <Darbok> thanks
[19:21:41] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all is there a way to copy to clipboard without using flash?
[19:22:25] <dcherman> mfoxdogg|work: only in IE.
[19:22:30] <mfoxdogg|work> crap

[20:52:36] <yogurt_truck> nights
[20:52:56] <coldhead> terrifying
[20:53:02] <coldhead> i'll have to try it
[21:36:08] <goddard> I want to show a button to my user when all form elements are filled in
[21:36:12] <goddard> how should i do this?
[21:36:27] <goddard> after each element focus?
[21:36:35] <goddard> or is there an easier way?
[21:38:57] <Cork-> goddard: you could check on keypress and see if the elements has a length > 0
[21:39:14] <Cork-> goddard: but ya, you would have to check each element separately
[22:01:37] <Cork> goddard: a better option would prob be to use var fields = $("#js_form :input"); and then reuse that variable all over the palace
[22:02:28] <Cork> and then you could do if(fields.filter(function() { return $(this).val() < 1; }).length > 0)
[22:04:56] <goddard> Cork, i gotta say i don't really understand what you typed haha
[22:05:13] <Cork> opps it should have been $(this).val().length
[22:05:31] <Cork> .filter will filter the resulting list
[22:06:39] <Cork> goddard: http://pastebin.com/bQzAF4Pi
[22:07:10] <Cork> bah thats backwards
[22:07:51] <Cork> http://pastebin.com/yNJvSEUf
[22:11:40] <goddard> let me see if i can get this working
[22:14:47] <roman_> can anybody tell me what might be wrong with this code http://jsfiddle.net/dR5fG/
[22:15:35] <Cork> roman_: too little information (that IS wrong with it?)
[22:15:45] <Cork> but are you sure $(this).next() gets the correct element?
[22:17:15] <roman_> Cork:  well the problem is im not able to catch the id from the hidden field.. it works with a selector but is doing it worng
[22:17:17] <roman_> wrong
[22:17:23] <the_dark_knight> hi, I have this code - http://www.bpaste.net/show/f7aW6Gyd3iW7Jh7F9nCp/ . I am using a dialog box to edit two fields from my databases's table. For that I am using checkboxes. for the first time, suppose first checkbox is selected and second is not, the next time the first checkbox persists it's behaviour. Please help me. I don't understand this behaviour.
[22:18:03] <Cork> roman_: and ui.item.id contains what you expect?
[22:19:11] <roman_> Cork:  isn't ui.item.id the element after .tableEmployee
[22:20:03] <Cork> no
[22:20:14] <Cork> its the data in the json response
[22:21:05] <thorie> hi, im trying to post a file using .ajax (and the jquery-iframe-transport plugin) but on chrome, even though I get a 200 OK response, the request comes up in the chrome debugger as "POST (canceled)" any idea why? Here's my code: http://thorie.com/ajaxpost
[22:22:30] <roman_> Cork:  u mean like this http://jsfiddle.net/dR5fG/1/ ?
[22:23:23] <Cork> roman_: uh... i don't know
[22:23:33] <Cork> i don't know how your php code orks
[22:23:35] <Cork> *works
[22:23:42] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[22:24:27] <roman_> Cork:  well just get_empleado() is the function that brings the name and id of the employees
[22:24:54] <Cork> roman_: have you checked the resulting json?
[22:25:06] <Cork> and have you checked that ui.item.id actually contains that value?
[22:25:29] <roman_> Cork:  how can i verify that
[22:25:50] <Cork> well, the json is to just open the request in a browser and look at it
[22:26:02] <Cork> the ui.item.id is a console.log in the event handler
[22:26:43] <rmurphey> thorie: out of curiosity, why are you providing the complete/success/etc handlers after the fact?
[22:26:56] <rmurphey> rather than $.ajax(url, { complete: fn, success: fn }) etc
[22:27:10] <the_dark_knight> Hi, state of one of my checkbox persists for different dialog boxes. I want the checkboxes to be unchecked by default. And then after I have retrived the values from db, I will decide whethere to check it or not. My code is here - http://www.bpaste.net/show/f7aW6Gyd3iW7Jh7F9nCp/
[22:27:38] <thorie> rmurphey: that's the example i saw in the comments here --> https://github.com/cmlenz/jquery-iframe-transport/blob/master/jquery.iframe-transport.js
[22:27:51] <roman_> Cork:  first thing works fine.. ill check the ui.item.id
[22:28:04] <rmurphey> thorie: per http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ jqXHR.success and jqXHR.complete are deprecated
[22:28:16] <thorie> rmurphey: oh ok
[22:28:48] <rmurphey> so you either want to provide them as part of the config object, or use the promise api
[22:29:56] <thorie> updated it.. still same Google Chrome (canceled) problem..
[22:30:09] <rmurphey> thorie: i see that the complete handler is firing but not success .. curious whether that will happen if you change it
[22:30:57] <roman_> Cork:  this is what im getting [{"id":"1","value":"Andres"}
[22:31:06] <rmurphey> it's weird, i also see the canceled thing, but the response is 200 OK
[22:31:08] <roman_> Cork:  seems good
[22:31:17] <Cork> from ui.item.id?
[22:31:17] <thorie> rmurphey: yup.. same
[22:31:43] <roman_> Cork:  thats the request
[22:32:03] <Cork> roman_: and whats in the variable?
[22:33:57] <Ghost1227> Does anyone have thoughts on good jQuery UI themes other than Delta and Bootstrap?
[22:39:24] <goddard> Cork, didn't work bud
[22:39:38] <Cork> goddard: what didn't work?
[22:39:43] <thorie> rmurphey: if i disable iframe:true then i don't get that "canceled" error anymore
[22:40:10] <goddard> the step0Next element didn't show itself when all form fields were filled out
[22:40:16] <goddard> and it never went hidden either
[22:41:19] <Cork> goddard: did the focusout fire?
[22:42:50] <goddard> nope
[22:43:16] <Cork> ok, so replace it keyup and see if that helps
[22:43:32] <roman_> =/
[22:45:19] <goddard> Cork, it does fire now and the step0Next element disappears but never reappears when all fields are filled out
[22:46:07] <Cork> goddard: could you make a working example of your page in jsfiddle?
[22:48:33] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I have a text box with id editSMSPackDiscount. Can I do this - $('#editSMSPackDiscount').attr("readonly", true).val("0"); or rather $('#editSMSPackDiscount').attr("readonly", true).val(0);  ?
[22:49:04] <goddard> Cork, no problem
[22:49:23] <Cork> the_dark_knight: prop('readonly', true) except for that; yes it should work
[22:49:55] <the_dark_knight> Cork: so instead of attr, I should use prop?
[22:50:09] <Cork> or attr('readonly', 'readonly')
[22:50:13] <Cork> your choice
[22:50:32] <Cork> or attr('readonly', 'readonly') / removeAttr('readonly')
[22:50:49] <Cork> or prop('readonly', true) / prop('readonly', false)
[22:51:20] <Cork> but attr('readonly', true) is wrong
[22:51:55] <MrTrick> I've got a <div id="foo"> full of buttons, form elements, etc. While I wait for an async response, is there a good way to *disable* the whole thing? No more responses to events, and the thing is shaded or something until I *undisable* it?
[22:52:28] <Cork> MrTrick: prop('disabled', true)
[22:52:37] <Cork> on the form elements
[22:52:38] <goddard> Cork, oh got it working but it also required me to make a selection on my select fields
[22:52:46] <trycatch> hello
[22:52:54] <trycatch> can u help me with this one
[22:52:59] <Cork> goddard: ah, ya :input matches select elements
[22:53:02] <trycatch> I'm trying to make a computation
[22:53:23] <goddard> trycatch, you just did
[22:53:26] <Cork> goddard: you can use $('#form').find('input, textarea') instead
[22:53:37] <Cork> if you prefer that
[22:53:38] <goddard> ok
[22:53:38] <trycatch> and the event I chose was 'blur'
[22:53:47] <trycatch> however it's giving me a Nan
[22:54:02] <goddard> Cork, nice trick man thanks for your help
[22:54:04] <roman_> Cork:  works if i do $('.id_employee').val(ui.item.id);
[22:54:10] <Cork> goddard: np
[22:54:42] <MrTrick> Cork: So, $('form').find('input,button').prop('disabled', true); ?
[22:54:46] <Cork> roman_: so $(this).next() doesn't match
[22:54:55] <Cork> MrTrick: ya, that should work
[22:55:06] <roman_> Cork:  i still dont know why
[22:55:25] <Cork> roman_: does $(this).nextAll('input').first() work?
[22:55:33] <MrTrick> I was hoping I could prevent *all* events from inside that div reaching handlers - any ideas there?
[22:55:49] <roman_> Cork:  should i try that?
[22:55:55] <Cork> roman_: yes
[22:56:06] <Cork> MrTrick: you could add a cover element ontop of it all
[22:56:16] <hagb4rd> .prop('disabled', true) <- so the eventlistening would be disabled on that element(&children)? but the state isn't lost..is it?
[22:56:23] <trycatch> here: http://pastebin.com/ukVHYn9M
[22:56:38] <Cork> hagb4rd: no the state shouldn't be lost
[22:56:40] <MrTrick> hagb4rd: I tried $('form').prop('disabled', true);  no luck.
[22:56:57] <Cork> ex. checkboxes and radio boxes should be locked in the current position
[22:57:12] <sacrilicious> good morning
[22:57:20] <sacrilicious> i have this function: $('#img_photo').mouseenter(function(){	
[22:57:26] <MrTrick> I'm more concerned about other click or focus handlers that might pop up dialogs.
[22:57:28] <sacrilicious> how do i define a wider range ?
[22:57:31] <thorie> hmm i was able to get rid of the (canceled) error on chrome, but I had to modify the jquery-iframe-transport.js file... there's a part in cleanUp() that does: iframe.attr("src", "javascript:false;").remove(); ... any idea why this would cause a problem?
[22:57:42] <nesoi> so if I want to make a pop-up with dynamic text in it and a two buttons, one which does something and another which closes the popup, what's a good way to do it?
[22:57:46] <nesoi> hi everyone!
[22:57:50] <sacrilicious> like $img_photo aand all divs within it ?
[22:57:55] <Cork> sacrilicious: by having another element outside that is wider
[22:57:59] <MrTrick> How would the cover element be placed?
[22:58:11] <hagb4rd> Mtrick: how bout just .enable() AND .disable() ?
[22:58:14] <Cork> sacrilicious: you can't define ranges for elements in html, the element is the size they are
[22:58:23] <sacrilicious> Cork: there is another div that appears dynamically inside it
[22:58:23] <hagb4rd> Mtrick: tried that?
[22:58:40] <Cork> MrTrick: position absolute, and the top/left + height/width of the form element for example
[22:58:58] <hagb4rd> oh its jqueryUI..actually
[22:59:03] <MrTrick> hagb4rd: what .enable() / .disable() methods? Ah.
[22:59:14] <hagb4rd> jqueryUI..if that's ok
[22:59:19] <Cork> sacrilicious: mouseenter triggers when you hover anything that is inside the selected element
[22:59:25] <hagb4rd> just googled that
[22:59:43] <hagb4rd> so no warranty
[23:00:16] <roman_> Cork:  nothing
[23:02:24] <nesoi> so if I want to make a pop-up with dynamic text in it and a two buttons, one which does something and another which closes the popup, what's a good way to do it?
[23:02:52] <Cork> roman_: that didn't work either?
[23:03:03] <Cork> roman_: what element is this?
[23:04:53] <roman_> works only using a selector.. i dont know if the problem can be related as im generating fields automatically and each field is autocompleted
[23:07:38] <Cork> roman_: check what element this is
[23:07:49] <Cork> i suspect that it isn't the input field, and thats why it fails for you
[23:13:36] <roman_> Cork: i'have never used the console.. but should be like this console.log($(this).next().val(ui.item.id)) ?
[23:15:41] <Cork> roman_: console.log(this)
[23:15:53] <Cork> the just check what element that is
[23:19:08] <roman_> Cork:  you were right.. is taking the input text not the hidden id
[23:23:27] <roman_> weird
[23:26:53] <sacrilicious> good morning again
