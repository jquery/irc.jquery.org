[04:52:29] <eynix> I have a jquery object, like $('<span>text</span>'), and I'd like to remove it and replace it by its text

[05:08:12] <moldy> hi
[05:08:41] <archer121> Hey, I want to match all input tags with `"type="hidden" name="damaged"`. How do I do this?
[05:09:34] <moldy> is there a variant of next() that finds elements regardless of their nesting in the dom?
[05:11:27] <moldy> https://dpaste.de/18kj i want to find the next .bar, relative to #foo
[05:24:38] <FilipNortic_> moldy: I don' think so but you should be able to write a filter function with .offset or something but it feels like your doing something odd here
[05:25:39] <moldy> FilipNortic_: yeah, my example was not quite right, either. i found a solution now :)
[05:26:49] <moldy> FilipNortic_: https://dpaste.de/cfTR `this` is the input on line 6 and i need to do something with the select on line 13
[05:27:04] <moldy> jQuery(this).closest(".form-group").next("select");  seems to work
[05:27:08] <archer121> In an input tag, I want to assign the value="". How do i do this? attr("value", "") seems to set it like this: value=
[05:27:23] <moldy> archer121: .val(), iirc?
[05:29:20] <codecutter> ajaxform is not a function http://pastebin.com/VrsJ1fiv (commented part seems to works although i get a 500 server error)
[05:31:41] <FilipNortic_> codecutter: ajaxFrom is not normal jQuery it's some plugin it think
[05:32:16] <codecutter> ah!
[05:33:45] <FilipNortic_> and if you use it; It provides a speical submi tmethod called ajaxsubmit or something like that. Now your chaining a normal subit event onto your ajax call which will never work
[05:37:36] <archer121> I have 3 pull down menus and three corresponding "Set Status" buttons. I want jquery to modify the document in such a way that when one status is set, others are reset. I have pasted relevant parts of the html doc and the jquery commands here: https://jsfiddle.net/d8xbL7c0/#&togetherjs=CwHFlIvE0K Can anyone tell me what is wrong?
[05:44:04] <FilipNortic_> archer121: lots of thing propobly
[05:44:38] <archer121> FilipNortic_: I am doing JQuery for the first time, would you help me sort this out?
[05:44:45] <FilipNortic_> use val() instead of attr to set value and when i try I don't find $("#catalogue_detail_biblio") in the page
[05:45:32] <archer121> FilipNortic_: That's because I did not give you the entire document. Shall I paste the entire document instead?
[05:46:54] <FilipNortic_> $("#catalogue_detail_biblio input[type='hidden'][name='itemlost']") this selector searches for and a hidden input with name item lost inside a div with id=catalouge_de...
[05:47:34] <archer121> yes, and I get the two hidden inputs.
[05:47:46] <archer121> Here is the entire document, http://paste.ubuntu.com/17427891/
[05:51:28] <FilipNortic_> archer121: the normal way to do this is a change event with a common class on the inputs then you can reset all exept the one that was changed
[05:53:31] <archer121> FilipNortic_: Will it work even when there are three submit buttons corresponding to the tree pull down menus?
[05:55:49] <FilipNortic_> depends of you accually submit the form when a value is changed but that would be wired...
[05:58:15] <maxpen> I could use some help
[05:58:38] <maxpen> I'm checking the select option if it has trustworthy and if it does do nothing and if it has no such option add it
[05:58:38] <maxpen> https://gist.github.com/bustapaladin/7455dcbf62d5b7e4d125a93f0b2013c4
[06:02:11] <archer121> FilipNortic_: I don't understand what you just said. The hidden input is used to echo back the values from the other two pull down menus to the server, changing only the value corresponding to the pull down menu that was chaged.
[06:02:17] <archer121> changed*
[06:03:30] <archer121> what I want is to set the value to "Choose" (which has value="0") and thus reset the other two fields.
[06:04:24] <maxpen> the issue is
[06:04:28] <maxpen> it adds it 6 times lol

[06:06:37] <BackEndCoder> <BackEndCoder> but thats not the correct syntax
[06:07:09] <BackEndCoder> the manual does something like :not(:checked)
[06:09:30] <Cork> BackEndCoder: css can't do :not on a parent selector
[06:09:53] <Cork> cause it would always match (all elements have a body parent for example)
[06:10:21] <Cork> what you could do is ex. $(':not(.tableFloatingHeaderOriginal) > .man-checkbox:checked')
[06:10:28] <Cork> but that would only match a direct parent
[06:10:37] <FilipNortic_> acher121: but each set status button submits your form
[06:11:12] <BackEndCoder> ok thanks
[06:11:15] <BackEndCoder> i will have a play around
[06:11:33] <Cork> BackEndCoder: another option is to so if($(this).closest('.tableFloatingHeaderOriginal').length > 0) { return; } in the callback
[06:11:42] <Cork> *to do
[06:12:08] <BackEndCoder> that might work better thanks
[06:12:23] <Cork> hmm
[06:12:31] <Cork> actually there is a better option
[06:12:52] <Cork> BackEndCoder: $('.man-checkbox:checked').not('.tableFloatingHeaderOriginal .man-checkbox')
[06:13:01] <Cork> that should do what you want
[06:13:15] <BackEndCoder> thank you
[06:13:19] <Cork> BackEndCoder: and actually $('.man-checkbox:checked:not(.tableFloatingHeaderOriginal .man-checkbox)') should work too
[06:13:25] <BackEndCoder> lol ok :)
[06:13:29] * BackEndCoder takes notes
[06:13:47] <BackEndCoder> my floating header duplicates a element in the html
[06:14:10] <BackEndCoder> i'm trying to stop it from counting all .man-checkbox references
[06:14:26] <BackEndCoder> but my orignal, doesn't work when they change the layout, adn the floating header doesn't exsist :P
[06:14:35] <BackEndCoder> so i needed to use .not() in some way
[06:14:41] <BackEndCoder> thank you thats working nicely

[06:19:19] <FilipNortic_> maxpen your question doen't really make sense
[06:19:27] <Cork> maxpen: if you want something you need to ask a question, throwing random links at me won't help
[06:19:43] <Cork> also don't ping me unless i've explicitly asked you a question
[06:19:50] <Cork> ask it in the channel and ppl will answer if they can
[06:19:51] <maxpen> sorry
[06:19:57] <maxpen> so let me explain
[06:19:59] <maxpen> the issue
[06:20:02] <maxpen> yes?
[06:20:04] <maxpen> anyone help me folks?
[06:20:12] <maxpen> I got a option select with values
[06:20:27] <maxpen> if the value "Trustworthy" is not in it
[06:20:29] <maxpen> add it
[06:20:37] <maxpen> but it first has to check its not in it
[06:20:44] <maxpen> so it doesn't get added double
[06:20:52] <maxpen> and now it is added due to each 5 times
[06:21:29] <FilipNortic_> maxpen: yeah it adds one for each option that isn't trustwothy
[06:21:55] <maxpen> how to make it only add one to the list
[06:22:31] <maxpen> one option "trustworthy
[06:22:38] <maxpen> if no usch option exist to chose from
[06:22:44] <maxpen> that is what I would like to achive
[06:22:49] <FilipNortic_> you don't want each here you just want $(option[value='trustwotthy]).lenght>0 or something like that
[06:23:03] <maxpen> well that makes no sense lol
[06:23:22] <maxpen> could you paste a bin?
[06:23:27] <Cork> maxpen: are you sure you don't just want to check $('#pods-form-ui-pods-meta-suspicion').val() == "trustworthy" ?
[06:23:41] <maxpen> Cork will try
[06:23:54] <Cork> ah, no you don't
[06:24:04] <maxpen> no?
[06:24:07] <maxpen> what?
[06:24:07] <Cork> maxpen: btw don't prefix ids with tag names
[06:24:13] <FilipNortic_> I think he want to check if his select has that option and if not add it
[06:24:14] <Cork> it makes the selector slower for no reason what so ever
[06:24:15] <maxpen> ok
[06:24:56] <maxpen> I'm in brain freeze
[06:25:08] <maxpen> just need a working code
[06:25:17] <Cork> maxpen: if(!$('#pods-form-ui-pods-meta-suspicion option[value="trustworthy"]').length > 0) { $('#pods-form-ui-pods-meta-suspicion').append($('<option>', { value: "trustworthy" }); }
[06:25:21] <Cork> that is what you want
[06:25:32] <maxpen> thank yo cork
[06:25:33] <maxpen> will try
[06:25:53] * Cork afk
[06:26:41] <maxpen> syntax error
[06:27:04] <FilipNortic_> maxpen: yeah but its mostly correct
[06:28:15] <maxpen> FilipNortic I can't use it though I don't find this syntac error
[06:28:25] <maxpen> I changed the dollar symbol with jQuery
[06:28:28] <maxpen> but that didn't fix it
[06:28:36] <FilipNortic_> the append isn't closed
[06:28:56] <maasha> Hi, how can setup an event listener to act if a dom object specified by a given id is changed?
[06:29:09] <maxpen> found it
[06:29:11] <maxpen> Cork that has a bug in it
[06:29:45] <FilipNortic_> we can help you here what bug is it
[06:31:50] <FilipNortic_> maasha: what would the difference be from a normal change event?
[06:32:44] <maasha> FilipNortic_: addition or removal of element via jquery-ui sortable
[06:37:04] <maasha> gotit there is an example here http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update
[08:22:55] <Uhkis> wow :D http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31044/is-there-an-exists-function-for-jquery
[08:25:25] <FilipNortic_> doent some browers retun null if the selector is empty?
[08:25:58] <FilipNortic_> hmm no that would be strange I'm getting things mixed up
[08:26:19] <Cork> FilipNortic_: you're thinking of querySelector()
[08:26:38] <Cork> $() _always_ returns a jquery object
[08:27:04] <FilipNortic_> yeah I wrote before thinking...
[08:27:22] <Cork> also wow.. defining a function to access length...
[08:27:23] <Cork> why >_<
[08:27:35] <Uhkis> not all methods return jquery object though
[08:27:41] <FilipNortic_> save chars?
[08:27:56] <Cork> sure, but all selector related ones
[08:28:02] <Cork> if ($(selector).is('*')) { <-- wow TT_TT
[08:28:34] <Uhkis> Cork: this answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/13313296/1381706 :D overkill much? :D
[08:28:46] <Cork> lol ya
[08:29:34] <Cork> but still 22 likes :D
[08:30:07] <Cork> exists: function() { return this.length } <-- lol
[08:30:13] <Cork> doesn't even return the correct type :/
[08:32:03] <Uhkis> not sure which is funnier, the correct answer in the question or those overkill answers
[08:32:43] <Cork> or that the correct answer isn't accepted as the answer
[08:32:59] <Cork> $(selector).length > 0
[08:34:38] <Uhkis> some of these questions makes me feel like people think jquery is its own language
[08:34:55] <Cork> oh, ya no question about that
[08:35:04] <Cork> ppl DO think jquery is a language
[08:35:37] <Uhkis> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1638449/1381706 at least he provided the warning :)
[08:36:03] <Cork> ..
[08:36:18] <Cork> he insteansiates jquery around an object to modify a href property...
[08:36:24] <Cork> that is... SAD
[08:36:37] <Cork> also that code doesn't work anymore
[08:36:43] <Cork> (you need to use prop)
[08:37:08] <Cork> location.setAttribute doesn't exist last i checked :D
[08:37:38] <Cork> but ya, jokes aside, there i a reason i recommend ppl to NOT look at so for answers
[08:37:58] <Cork> cause even high rated ones are normally horribly bad
[08:39:12] <Uhkis> yeah, seems so
[08:41:29] <Duikb00t> not always but i think it's not 'bad' but more deprecated
[08:41:50] <Cork> i didn't say always i said normally
[08:41:56] <Cork> and no i don't just men outdated
[08:42:19] <Duikb00t> :(
[08:42:42] <Cork> but ya, outdated answers are a big problem too
[08:43:01] <Cork> or rather outdated knowledge
[08:43:07] <Uhkis> especially with that datestamp being so small and hard to read
[08:43:13] <Cork> cause ppl answer new questions with old answers
[08:43:45] <Cork> it took so about 2 years to notice that jquery moved property access to .prop
[08:43:59] <Cork> and for that time they still pointed ppl at .attr
[08:47:05] <Duikb00t> Cork:  When you have X-browser support in mind.
[08:47:10] <Duikb00t> Which version do you use of jQuery?
[08:47:11] <Duikb00t> 1.9?
[08:47:23] <Duikb00t> IE8 +
[08:47:39] <Cork> 1.x
[08:47:45] <Cork> all of 1.x supports old ies
[08:47:50] <Cork> 2.x support ie9+
[08:48:17] <Duikb00t> Currently I am always using 1.9 to make sure it runs in IE8
[08:48:28] <Duikb00t> Are there so much differences in 2.x?
[08:48:45] <Cork> yes
[08:48:54] <Cork> 2.x doesn't support attachEvent for example
[08:49:01] <Cork> no reason to stay at 1.9 though
[08:49:06] <Cork> 1.12 works fine
[08:49:42] <Uhkis> only a few years more and we can all start using 2.x
[08:49:55] <Cork> heh i think most will just straight from 1.x to 3
[08:50:24] <Cork> that is my plan at least
[08:50:41] <Uhkis> well yeah, it's probably somewhere around 3.5 by then
[08:58:57] <taplar> mmm, jumping from 1 to 3.  straight from single to menage a trois
[09:07:00] <hellyeah> taplar,
[09:07:06] <taplar> hellyeah,
[09:07:23] <hellyeah> i really wanna be js master i want to give education to my collegue at company. Comapny give me chance to do that
[09:07:32] <hellyeah> is there any way you can suggest to me to follow
[09:07:53] <taplar> not really.  i just learned by doing
[09:09:09] <helldamn_> sorry
[09:09:12] <helldamn_> i am hellyeah
[09:09:19] <taplar> lies
[09:09:47] <taplar> lies!
[09:09:50] <hellyeah> :D
[09:10:08] <hellyeah> You are now identified for hellyeah
[09:10:10] <hellyeah> :D
[09:10:28] <taplar> could have bribed chatserv
[09:10:42] <hellyeah> you are joking right :D
[09:10:48] <taplar> who then in turn bribed chanserv
[09:10:53] <hellyeah> taplar,  http://cube-drone.com/comics/c/encapsulation
[09:11:30] <hellyeah> taplar,  do you have some advice?
[09:11:39] <taplar> about that picture?
[09:11:46] <hellyeah> no
[09:11:50] <taplar> lol
[09:12:00] <hellyeah> i wannt be expert at jquery for teaching to my collegue at company
[09:12:14] <hellyeah> taplar,  i wonder your comment about picture also ofc
[09:12:26] <taplar> "not really. i just learned by doing"
[09:12:43] <taplar> and i don't know much about docker yet.  there is some talk about it in the office, but we haven't moved on it yet
[09:12:47] <hellyeah> i learnt with that way too
[09:12:52] <taplar> Uhkis likes it, iirc
[09:13:12] <hellyeah> i wanna teach my collegue at company
[09:13:33] <hellyeah> i can be popular with that way
[09:13:44] <hellyeah> and company realize me :D
[09:14:00] <hellyeah> because people in my departmant do some mobbings to me
[09:14:14] <taplar> 'mobbings'?
[09:15:05] <hellyeah> do you know mobbing?
[09:15:26] <FilipNortic_> bullying
[09:15:28] <taplar> i know two possible definitions, one being a joke reply.  what do you mean by it?
[09:16:00] <hellyeah> try to annoy me
[09:16:14] <taplar> oh.  your going to have that any where, :s
[09:17:12] <hellyeah> thats why i want to learn js and jquery deeply to offer a company i can teach javascript and jquery to employees
[09:17:28] <hellyeah> if company accept this i get rig of those people
[09:17:31] <taplar> hows that going to affect your mobbing?
[09:17:53] <taplar> lol
[09:17:54] <hellyeah> company know i do some stuff
[09:18:10] <hellyeah> i will ask for changes of department
[09:18:18] <taplar> good luck with that
[09:18:21] <hellyeah> i will be stronger may be
[09:18:57] <hellyeah> they want me to finish llots of thing now they just try to mob me
[09:19:00] <taplar> it's a little strange to be asking for someone's termination because 'i do not like them'
[09:19:08] <FilipNortic_> suggestions of changes to a working systems usally have quite a bit of blowback
[09:19:20] <hellyeah> blowback?
[09:19:26] <hellyeah> what does it mean_
[09:19:38] <FilipNortic_> resitance
[09:19:43] <taplar> or reprocussions
[09:20:25] <FilipNortic_> at least in a big company it's tends to be don't rock the boat
[09:20:31] <FilipNortic_> at a*
[09:20:40] <hellyeah> no word resitance
[09:21:00] <taplar> in any case, i'm not sure of the acceptable work environment policies in your country, but i would be hard pressed to believe that there would be one where everyone has to get along, otherwise your expendable
[09:21:20] <taplar> it's tolerable up until some level, the question is what that level is
[09:21:22] <hellyeah> we are all expandable
[09:21:43] <hellyeah> lots of things are weird here
[09:21:48] <FilipNortic_> expandable or expendable?
[09:21:54] <hellyeah> i just try to protect ny position
[09:22:03] <hellyeah> expendable
[09:23:23] <hellyeah> anyway i want to learn jquery really well i want to teach that to someone
[09:23:32] <hellyeah> i am searching what i can do for this
[09:23:50] <Cork> hellyeah: i would strongly recommend reading through and understanding the jquery.js lib
[09:24:07] <Cork> it will help you A LOT at understanding how things work and why
[09:24:30] <hellyeah> Cork,  talking abour reading function in jquery.js
[09:24:31] <hellyeah> ?
[09:24:39] <Cork> not just functions
[09:24:42] <Cork> the entire file
[09:24:56] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:25:05] <Cork> and looking at parts until you understand what they do and why
[09:25:05] <hellyeah> ouch
[09:25:08] <hellyeah> :D
[09:25:21] <Cork> na, not really, i do this every few versions
[09:25:28] <taplar> egh
[09:25:29] <Cork> as the lib changes
[09:25:53] <hellyeah> egh? what is this expression for?
[09:26:18] <taplar> similar to your ouch statement
[09:26:30] <FilipNortic_> well if your js basics isn't strong enough it will be a hassle but then u should propably focus on that
[09:26:34] <Cork> i actually find it quite fun, the lib of quite well written now days
[09:26:50] <hellyeah> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.js
[09:26:52] <Cork> ++FilipNortic_
[09:27:01] <Cork> that is exactly it
[09:27:20] <taplar> i'll look at the source for functions if i'm curious.  but i'd be hard pressed to sit down and go over the whole thing.  guess i'm not that dedicated, :)
[09:27:29] <taplar> so hellyeah can surpass me in that aspect!
[09:27:37] <Cork> jumping straight into jquery is a fast way to get going, but you really NEED to know the basics before you can teach other
[09:27:43] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[09:27:55] <FilipNortic_> btw i hang in the postgres room quite alot too and the best guys there also reads the source code alot
[09:28:06] <Cork> taplar: my point of view is "if i'm to use a third party lib, i have to be able to maintain it if it gets dropped"
[09:28:20] <FilipNortic_> but i'm not that good at c saddly
[09:28:31] <taplar> Cork: ah, makes sense
[09:28:35] <Cork> and if it can't then i look for a simpler one, or write a cleaner alternative
[09:28:48] <Cork> (like replace a tooltip plugin with 5 lines of code :D)
[09:29:26] <hellyeah> i have to make my  js skill perfect before reading jquery file i suppose
[09:29:35] <taplar> perfect?
[09:29:37] <Cork> not really
[09:29:46] <Cork> hellyeah: what you have to have is basics
[09:29:58] <Cork> like how you define functions, how you modify arras
[09:30:08] <hellyeah> array?_
[09:30:12] <Cork> you should have a basic understanding of what prototype is
[09:30:22] <hellyeah> let me take a note
[09:30:28] <Cork> except for that just start reading
[09:30:35] <Cork> look things up on mdn as you get stuck
[09:30:56] <Cork> jquery is actually much simpler in its structure then ppl think
[09:31:13] <taplar> the biggest chunk of it, iirc, is the sizzle in it
[09:31:23] <Cork> na, not really
[09:31:33] <Cork> it used to be when it had to support document.all
[09:31:47] <hellyeah> what is arras btw?
[09:31:52] <taplar> arrays
[09:32:02] <Cork> but now days it is basically just a symbol replacements in strings
[09:32:02] <hellyeah> okey i understand correctly
[09:32:10] <Cork> and then it feeds it through querySelectorAll
[09:32:20] <fission6> does anyone have any theories in regards to this question, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37873072/using-jquery-plugin-with-webpack-in-es6-module
[09:32:27] <Cork> i think sizzle is like 100 - 200 lines of code now, its nothing
[09:32:31] <taplar> huh, i'll have to take a look again.  maybe i was looking at 1.12
[09:32:52] <hellyeah> i dont know anything about sizzle
[09:32:53] <Cork> taplar: it isn't big since ~1.5
[09:33:15] <Cork> hellyeah: sizzle is what lets you do $(':input') for example
[09:33:23] <hellyeah> ah
[09:33:26] <RattyWork> Hey, anyone know of any good table editors like handsontables that will convert data arrays to columns instead of rows? For some reason I canâ€™t seem to find anything to do that automaticallyâ€¦.
[09:33:26] <hellyeah> looks simple
[09:33:29] <Cork> or rather $(document).find(':input')
[09:33:37] <Cork> hellyeah: it isn't
[09:33:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:33:46] <Cork> not simple, but it isn't lot of code
[09:34:00] <Cork> :input isn't supported by css
[09:34:13] <Cork> so sizzle has to find that in the string and run js functions in it place
[09:34:22] <Cork> and run the css selectors before and after
[09:34:42] <hellyeah> should i read sizzle.js?
[09:35:14] <hellyeah> Cork,  i dont quiet get it your lastt statement
[09:35:45] <z1haze_work> anyone know why my grid items are a few pixels too tall? http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/rLLEbz
[09:36:00] <hellyeah> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/src/sizzle.js
[09:36:51] <hellyeah> it is almost 1000 lines
[09:37:19] <hellyeah> may be more
[09:42:28] <z1haze_work> http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/rLLEbz grid-item is 4 px too tall, but why? any packery users?
[09:43:03] <FilipNortic_> man all the time I've spent trying to figure out how map works and it was like 20 lines of code
[09:46:56] <hellyeah> map works simple
[09:47:10] <hellyeah> but which map are you talking about?
[09:47:24] <hellyeah> map is like forEach, at the plus side you can return something
[09:47:43] <hellyeah> you can filter array and put into another array
[09:48:00] <hellyeah> you can write if etc. i think map is just functional way of writing forEach
[09:48:03] <hellyeah> can i say this?
[09:50:26] <helldamn_> hey again
[09:56:48] <Justice> so i create a jquery object $(<lestuff>) how do I append to some div or something without it getting "object object" ?
[09:57:00] <Justice> seems i have some brainfart with this.
[09:57:20] <hellyeah> brainfart i like this word
[09:57:23] <hellyeah> :p
[09:57:52] <hellyeah> Justice,  did you fiddle it?
[09:58:02] <decx> dont treat it as a string and you'll be fine
[09:58:13] <decx> types yo
[09:58:20] <hellyeah> what do you mean getting object object
[09:58:28] <hellyeah> i donnt understand this
[09:58:54] <Cork> Justice: you get object object if you concat an object with a string
[09:58:56] <Justice> I am doing an input radio button trying to append it to dom with divobject.append(stuff)
[09:59:04] <Justice> yeah
[09:59:17] <Cork> Justice: if you want to append string mixed with other elements you need to first convert both to dom elements
[10:00:24] <Justice> Cork: with get ?
[10:00:47] <Justice> no thats dom to $
[10:03:48] <GeekShadow> hello
[10:04:42] <GeekShadow> when I use .show() with either linear or swing easing the div is opening from the top left corner
[10:04:45] <hellyeah> Justice,  i think you should do fiddle
[10:04:57] <GeekShadow> is it possible to make it open from top to bottom instead ?
[10:05:39] <hellyeah> as far as i know show() method accept "time parameter"
[10:06:18] <hellyeah> GeekShadow,  did you check animate
[10:06:35] <GeekShadow> http://api.jquery.com/show/
[10:06:38] <GeekShadow> I'll look
[10:06:40] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:06:45] <hellyeah> this may help
[10:10:51] <GeekShadow> hellyeah: I found .slideDown, thanks anyway :)
[10:11:56] <Justice> hm sek
[10:13:00] <Justice> hellyeah: something like this; https://jsfiddle.net/h2u57rcv/
[10:13:52] <Justice> meh forgot about the object for if but yeah
[10:16:14] <Justice> https://jsfiddle.net/h2u57rcv/3/
[10:23:08] <geri> hi, the user can select different tasks at the start of a simulation. at the end there is a summary depending on the selection at the beginning...how to approach it?
[10:31:50] <z1haze_work> in the callback of a slidetoggle() function can is there a way to determine which way its sliding? like check the display: value or something?
[10:32:50] <hellyeah> Justice,  not expert here but you dont append element
[10:33:00] <hellyeah> you append content instead
[10:34:35] <hellyeah> sorry
[10:34:41] <hellyeah> seems problem is <br>
[10:35:00] <Justice> ?
[10:35:14] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/h2u57rcv/4/
[10:35:19] <hellyeah> ops
[10:35:25] <hellyeah> anyway i removed br
[10:37:41] <Justice> yeah its like Cork said that you need to play differently with objects and strings.
[10:37:48] <Justice> but im unsure how really to do it correctly
[10:37:53] <arc_> this is a much harder way to build this object
[10:37:55] <km4> hi guys ;D
[10:38:03] <km4> whats up?
[10:38:06] <hellyeah> Junaos,
[10:38:08] <hellyeah> ops
[10:38:18] <hellyeah> Justice,  btw some suggestion for you
[10:38:34] <Justice> hellyeah: but the current code works; http://codepad.org/eHNQfGB0
[10:38:39] <hellyeah> var input = $('<input'>); will create input
[10:39:00] <hellyeah> you can addClass you can prop('id', someinteger);
[10:39:17] <hellyeah> dont make your code unreadable
[10:39:24] <hellyeah> use css class and jquery method
[10:40:15] <hellyeah> + ' <br£ ' + you should use that it seems
[10:40:34] <hellyeah> <br>
[10:45:35] <Justice> hellyeah: yeah im redowing it atm since I also hate doing it like strings.
[10:50:36] <yottabyte> hi, the docs say $.get, $.ajax return jqXHR, is this different from Deferred objects? can I use .done() with them?
[10:52:44] <Justice> hellyeah: any idea how to add text to input radio when doing it that way?
[10:53:20] <FilipNortic_> yottabyte: done is a deffered object and you can (and should) use them on all ajax calls rather than a success attribute
[10:54:34] <yottabyte> so I do $.get().done?
[10:54:40] <yottabyte> and $.ajax().done?
[10:55:33] <FilipNortic_> yeah with the callcackfunction inside
[10:55:43] <FilipNortic_> callback function*
[10:57:23] <FilipNortic_> yottabyte:  not really sure what you are asking. done replaces the success atrriburte, fail replaces error: and always replaces finally:
[10:57:32] <hellyeah> Justice,  i am not so experienced
[10:57:41] <hellyeah> but dont do that hard coded
[10:57:57] <hellyeah> check .prop, .attr, addClass
[10:58:10] <hellyeah> i need to go
[10:59:27] <theLearner> hello
[10:59:32] <theLearner> need some help here
[10:59:34] <theLearner> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY
[10:59:42] <theLearner> that is the test case
[11:00:40] <theLearner> this is what I want to achieve: I just need to increment counter only ONCE every time I drop draggable from the container to the droppable area
[11:01:13] <theLearner> the issue: every time you release draggable inside droppable counter increments even if the draggable is already inside the droppable area
[11:01:15] <theLearner> please help
[11:01:16] <theLearner> thanks
[11:03:17] <arc_> Justice this is what i would do https://jsfiddle.net/h2u57rcv/5/
[11:03:52] <arc_> note that i didn't do what you're trying to do with the checked property. i just set it to true or false, not based on those variables
[11:03:56] <arc_> since i don't totally understand your goal there
[11:04:10] <FilipNortic_> theLearner: why not just recount on every drop instead of incrementing
[11:05:36] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: I wanted to know how many draggables I have inside the droppable after I am done with the desired number of draggables inside droppable area
[11:07:31] <FilipNortic_> yeah but if you do count=$("#dropable_id").children(".dragable").length on each drop
[11:08:37] <FilipNortic_> then you can compare with old value or something like that
[11:09:23] <jose3_> would anyone be willing to look at my code? I have no specific problem, i just know its not very clean
[11:09:57] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: ok let me experiment on your suggestion
[11:09:59] <theLearner> thanks
[11:10:43] <FilipNortic_> theLearner: other alternative is to set classes on dragable which is a bit of a pain
[11:11:21] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: yeah I just tried it but I have not yet fully explored that idea yet
[11:11:29] <theLearner> let me try what you suggested
[11:14:15] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: just as I thought
[11:14:31] <theLearner> your idea will only work if I do an append when dropping
[11:14:48] <theLearner> secondly it will also require using classes
[11:20:40] <FilipNortic_> theLearner: yeah append would kind of defeat the purpose so classes it is then
[11:23:23] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY
[11:23:47] <theLearner> i implemented your code but counter always equal to zero even if the draggable class is dropped
[11:24:08] <theLearner> please have a looked
[11:24:12] <theLearner> *look
[11:26:15] <yottabyte> can I do $.get().done().then()?
[11:26:29] <yottabyte> now does that rely on .done() succeeding or whatever?
[11:37:22] <FilipNortic_> yottabyte:  no point in chaining a .then() to done then is for when calles which as usefull with multiple ajax calls and callbacks
[11:38:51] <FilipNortic_> for an ordinary ajax request eg ajax, get, post etc.  done().fail().always() cover all your needs
[11:41:03] <FilipNortic_> theLearner: thought that was what you relized erlier problem is they aren't appended, and (this) in drop referse to droppable
[11:41:47] <FilipNortic_> you need some way to access the object you dropped but when i looked in the api quickly i couldn't find any such method
[11:42:38] <FilipNortic_> worst case you have to do something ugly with position. Which frankly seems horrible
[11:43:49] <FilipNortic_> theLearner: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10368367/counting-the-number-of-divs-placed-into-a-div-via-drag-and-drop
[11:43:56] <FilipNortic_> seems this is how you do it
[11:44:19] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: ok will go and have a look
[12:01:24] <theLearner> FilipNortic_: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY
[12:01:28] <theLearner> that is the latest version
[12:01:55] <theLearner> I am wondering how come the ui class attribute cannot be captured at all
[12:02:05] <theLearner> the console says undefined
[12:06:47] <tocka> hi guys, I have this function that tracks is the element visible in viewport http://pastebin.com/nSss2YkJ
[12:07:02] <tocka> but it doesnt track dynamic elements.. What is the problem :|
[12:07:07] <tocka> Could someone help out? :o
[12:07:25] <theLearner> tocka: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY
[12:07:35] <theLearner> please have look at my code
[12:07:54] <theLearner> how come the ui.draggable class attribute says undefined when it has a class
[12:07:58] <tocka> LOL :D
[12:08:52] <tocka> theLearner i dont get any errors :|
[12:09:10] <theLearner> tocka: at your console
[12:09:13] <theLearner> its says undefined
[12:09:15] <tocka> nop.. nothing
[12:09:24] <theLearner> I did
[12:09:39] <theLearner> ctrl+shift+i
[12:09:42] <theLearner> you will see
[12:10:10] <shoky> theLearner: because your drop handler arguments are in the wrong order
[12:11:29] <theLearner> shoky: thanks for that
[12:11:34] <theLearner> :)
[12:11:39] <theLearner> my next question is this
[12:12:13] <theLearner> how do I prevent multiple increment of the counter when the draggable is already dropped inside the droppable area
[12:13:14] <theLearner> what I mean is even if the droppable is dropped many times over counter will not increment.  It will only increment on the first time the draggable is dropped into the droppable area and not when it is dropped once it is already inside
[12:13:34] <shoky> you should probably move the dropped element to be a child of the droppable. then just count how many children there are
[12:14:00] <theLearner> shoky: but that requires appending right
[12:14:12] <shoky> ya
[12:14:14] <theLearner> children is already invoked when the draggable is appended
[12:14:27] <shoky> hm?
[12:15:32] <Justice> arc_: I did this; http://codepad.org/Iy8HKDvm
[12:15:38] <Justice> but cannot seem to get text working.
[12:24:23] <theLearner> shoky: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY?editors=1111
[12:25:16] <theLearner> I managed to achieve what I wanted now my question is why is it that there seems to be multiple instance of draggable appended each time I append one draggable into the droppable area
[12:25:24] <theLearner> please have a look at my code
[12:28:49] <shoky> theLearner: i don't see multiple instances appended
[12:29:07] <theLearner> shoky: look at the bottom of the droppable area
[12:29:35] <shoky> i see only the one i dragged being appended. and because of the css it appears below
[12:29:52] <theLearner> when you drop one draggabe into the droppable area another copy gets pasted underneath the droppable area try moving your scroll bar down and you will it
[12:30:11] <theLearner> see it
[12:30:21] <shoky> it's not another copy, it's the one you dragged
[12:30:42] <shoky> if you check the DOM you'll see just the one
[12:31:04] <shoky> you can do .css({left:0,top:0})  when you append it, to reset its position
[12:36:16] <Justice> I create radioBtns with; http://codepad.org/zwav3vNJ however cannot seem to get text working
[12:36:23] <Justice> tried appending label but it wont display.
[12:36:39] <Justice> the button itself works
[12:38:21] <shoky> radio button's don't have text, they are just the button
[12:39:36] <Justice> how add text beside it?
[12:39:56] <Z3R0> anyone know where in BS3 the modal template code is? I canâ€™t seem to find where the actual modal template is
[12:40:10] <shoky> Justice: add another element.. or just append text
[12:40:48] <shoky> usually radios are paired with a <label>
[12:41:08] <Justice> shoky: tried label but no avail, inspecting showed label but browser did not
[12:41:27] <shoky> then you did something wrong, or had bad css
[12:42:47] <Z3R0> nvm about the previous questionâ€¦ just now trying to find the code that generates the <!â€” .modal â€”> line
[12:44:20] <Justice> shoky: tried; http://codepad.org/O6zwjOUK
[12:44:51] <shoky> Justice: you can't append elements to an <input>
[12:46:00] <Justice> elemnts in chromium shows the label but the browser does not display the ctual text.
[12:46:15] <shoky> you can't append element to an <input> :)
[12:46:32] <shoky> anyways if you still have problems, make a jsfiddle so we can see the result too
[12:47:24] <Z3R0> nvm idiot again haha Iâ€™m just going to leave hte room before I get any dumberâ€¦ (sorry guys)
[12:48:28] <Justice> some other time gotta go =)
[12:50:08] <theLearner> shoky: please have a look at my code: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY?editors=1011
[12:51:02] <shoky> theLearner: you're doing  .remove( $(...) )
[12:51:08] <shoky> that can't be right
[12:51:11] <theLearner> I solve the problem with "seeming" duplication when appending but I can no longer drag back to the container when I drop the draggable into the droppable area
[12:51:30] <theLearner> shoky: no removeClass
[12:51:58] <shoky> theLearner: line 23  has .remove
[12:52:04] <shoky> $(ui.draggable).remove($(ui.draggable).clone().draggable().css({"left":"0","top":"0"}));
[12:53:49] <theLearner> shoky: ok I changed that to .append and the problem came back
[12:54:24] <theLearner> shoky: each time you drop a draggable there seems to be a second copy created
[12:54:34] <shoky> theLearner: you're cloning it each time now.. so there's a new clone each time yep
[12:55:40] <theLearner> shoky: i just remove .clone and nothing seems to be appended anymore
[12:55:43] <theLearner> ;)
[12:55:44] <shoky> theLearner: also you're appending into the draggable ...
[12:55:56] <shoky> $(ui.draggable).append  ...
[12:56:08] <shoky> btw  ui.draggable is already a jquery object, don't wrap it again with $()
[12:57:15] <theLearner> shoky: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vKKopY?editors=1011
[12:57:18] <theLearner> what about that
[12:57:31] <theLearner> anything else I can improve on the code to make it cleaner and neater
[12:57:51] <taplar> maybe Justice will read the logs https://jsfiddle.net/zc6rz7ur/
[12:58:01] <shoky> you can do what i just said. and you're calling .draggable() on something that's already draggable
[12:59:09] <shoky> theLearner: that for loop to create them can just have this inside btw..  $('<div class="draggable">').appendTo('#container')
[13:00:00] <shoky> otherwise i donno what your purpose is with this and where you're heading, so hard to suggest anything
[13:02:52] <taplar> i'd create a document fragment to put all your elements in for the top loop, and append it at the end
[13:03:21] <taplar> cache that container lookup too
[13:05:07] <taplar> dunno if it would be less work to create it once and just clone in the loop...
[13:05:27] <taplar> probably oo at that point
[13:07:52] <ertl> hello, I'm trying to move table rows up/down when pressing up/down keys, it works fine, I was wondering how could I move two positions up or down, ie. is row.insertAfter(row.next(row.next())); possible?
[13:09:02] <taplar> should be able to do next().next()
[13:34:21] <esagon> hi you all
[13:38:31] <esagon> somebody can look at this? http://jsbin.com/vanuwawube/edit?html,output the problem is: i use jquery mobile 1.3.2 and i want to have a multipage html page, but i've to copy and paste each heaher and footer or i can write it only one time for every page?
[13:38:56] <yottabyte> what is the difference between $.get(url, function(response) { }); and $.get(url).done(function(response) { }); ? also, where does the function get its arguments like response, etc. I see sometimes you can get multiple objects or json back, can you name them whatever?
[13:42:07] <taplar> yottabyte: both the get callback and the done() execute when the request is resolved, so on success
[13:42:28] <taplar> you can check the docs for both to see what arguments they are given.  you can name them whatever
[13:43:36] <yottabyte> taplar: how is the order determined, though?
[13:43:58] <taplar> order of what?
[13:44:10] <yottabyte> .done(function(a, b, c)
[13:44:14] <yottabyte> the response
[13:44:19] <taplar> it's what's in the docs
[13:44:22] <dranve> guys, i have some rows selected (it's 10 div objects)  now i want to select particular among them like rows.find('[div-id="1234"]'); however, it doesn't get that one... why???
[13:44:25] <yottabyte> docs for what?
[13:44:34] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[13:45:30] <taplar> dranve: so your elements have <div div-id="1234"> ?
[13:45:39] <dranve> taplar, yes
[13:45:44] <taplar> you want filter instead of find
[13:45:50] <dranve> taplar, :D
[13:46:04] <dranve> hehehe thnx i'll try i think you are right thank you
[13:46:08] <taplar> and you should consider sticking 'data-' on the front of that
[13:46:42] <dranve> taplar, reason?
[13:46:59] <dranve> filter gets the first?
[13:47:01] <taplar> it's a non-standard html attribute.  for browser compatability you want to make them data elements
[13:47:11] <taplar> filter will match against all of them
[13:48:03] <dranve> taplar, so that is quite slow... would be same if i use rows.each and go throught them until i find THE one and loop it every time i need it..
[13:48:04] <dranve> ?
[13:48:30] <taplar> shouldn't be that slow for 10 divs
[13:48:55] <taplar> wait, how many rows?
[13:49:58] <taplar> you want to do that filter on your divs, not on the row
[13:52:02] <dranve> taplar, it works ok..
[13:52:21] <dranve> well it's usually 10-20 divs but real limit is 300
[13:52:38] <dranve> yes... it was filter i needed ..
[13:53:12] <taplar> ok, the important thing to note here is you should try to do those kinds of selector, if you must, as filters, and not finders cause they scan everything
[13:53:47] <dranve> taplar, thank you very much
[13:57:05] <yottabyte> taplar: if I have numerous callbacks in .done, are they executed one by one?
[13:58:36] <taplar> "The deferred.done() method accepts one or more arguments, all of which can be either a single function or an array of functions. When the Deferred is resolved, the doneCallbacks are called. Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. "
[14:17:27] <theLearner> shoky: I manage to implement the code well
[14:17:34] <Sagar> suppose i have a url https://www.domain.com/auth/fb/call#code=SomeCode&otherquer=1 , how can i get the value of #code=, Also the #code can be any where, like http://domain.com/auth/something/fb/something/call#code=someCode&otherQuery
[14:17:37] <theLearner> but i have question though
[14:18:04] <taplar> Sagar: try window.location.hash
[14:18:26] <theLearner> is it possible to append and leave it to jquery to paste the draggables without having to use css({"left":"0", "top":"0"})
[14:18:33] <Sagar> the url is entered in input box, its not in the url
[14:19:05] <theLearner> the problem only happens the first time you drop the draggables into the droppable area
[14:19:43] <theLearner> then they are dropped back to the container area there is no problem anymore when they are dropped back again into the droppable area the second time around
[14:19:45] <taplar> Sagar: you could split on '#' and then take the [1] element, if it exists
[14:20:08] <taplar> or value.substr(value.indexOf('#'))
[14:20:43] <Sagar> The issue is the url can be  https://www.domain.com/auth/fb/call#code=SomeCode&otherquer=1 or http://domain.com/auth/something/fb/something/call#code=someCode&otherQuery or even http://domain.com/auth/something/fb/something/call#otherPart=here&#code=someCode&otherQuery
[14:21:00] <taplar> multiple # in a url aren't really valid
[14:21:14] <taplar> # as part of a parameter key should be encoded
[14:21:34] <Sagar> It's for the reason, its not in URL, it needs to be entered in input
[14:22:11] <taplar> so find the first one that doesn't appear after a ?
[14:22:53] <Sagar> What if i split with #code?
[14:24:01] <taplar> *shrug* try it and see
[14:27:28] <arc_> taplar i showed him what to do and he was like "i did this, it doesn't work" : /
[14:27:50] <arc_> too bad i wasn't here to explain i guess
[14:28:25] <Sagar> o.o
[14:28:34] <taplar> ah
[14:29:05] <Sagar> Got it anyways :) Thanks
[14:29:54] <theLearner> arc_: need some help
[14:29:57] <theLearner> https://www.infinityls.org/home/decoratingByCounting/2
[14:30:45] <theLearner> my issue is that the first time I drop the class sticker into the droppable area they stick way right into the top
[14:30:49] <theLearner> how can I solve this issue
[14:31:01] <arc_> sry i don't know anything about draggable stuff
[14:31:24] <arc_> tbh i wish no one would use it :D
[14:31:27] <blakespot> I have jquery loading in my footer (WP site) and I then have script tags below it on the page and a simple " $(".menu-item-object-dinner").append("@@@@"); " and I get $ is not a function error.
[14:31:37] <theLearner> shoky: are you still around
[14:31:40] <taplar> use jQuery
[14:31:40] <theLearner> https://www.infinityls.org/home/decoratingByCounting/2
[14:31:45] <theLearner> this is the my problem an
[14:31:50] <taplar> wordpress operates in no conflict mode
[14:31:50] <theLearner> *man
[14:31:52] <blakespot> There are things below the jquery include and above my <script> tags that require jquery and are running fine
[14:31:55] <blakespot> Why would this be?
[14:32:26] <decx> wrap it up
[14:32:27] <arc_> if you're using wordpress and you are writing custom jquery code, write jQuery() instead of $(). you will save yourself a lot of headaches trying to figure out how to get it to work
[14:32:32] <blakespot> jquery.js is loaded and things are using it on the site
[14:32:34] <taplar> why are you including multiple versions of jQuery?
[14:32:38] <theLearner> my only problem no is how to make the class sticker just append to a particular place inside the picture
[14:32:48] <theLearner> without having to go straight right into the top
[14:32:50] <decx> (function($){ mystuff })(jQuery)
[14:33:09] <blakespot> taplar: that to me?
[14:33:17] <blakespot> arc_: hmm
[14:33:18] <taplar> oh, i think i misread your comment
[14:33:33] <taplar> so you have your include, some jquery logic that works, and now some jquery logic that does not
[14:34:11] <blakespot> So instead of $(".menu-item-object-dinner").append("@@@@"); ....do.... jQuery(".menu-item-object-dinner").append("@@@@");
[14:34:14] <blakespot> ?
[14:34:21] <taplar> or wrap it like decx suggested
[14:34:23] <decx> do what i wrote
[14:34:33] <decx> aint nobody got time to write jQuery all the time
[14:34:39] <taplar> heh
[14:35:16] <decx> you should also understand the concept of iife's and their arguments
[14:35:28] <blakespot> damn that wokred
[14:35:35] <blakespot> I never ran into that
[14:35:36] <blakespot> beore
[14:35:52] <blakespot> woudl it be same if I were calling a .js file in a script tag?
[14:36:01] <blakespot> Would $() then work in WP?
[14:36:06] <blakespot> I think I've done that more typically
[14:36:11] <decx> wp does noconflict
[14:36:29] <taplar> script includes are essentially the same as if your logic had been on the page at that point in time
[14:36:39] <decx> so your window element doesnt have the $ shortcut
[14:42:34] <geri> hi, how can i have a scrollbar in my dialog by default enabled? $('#dialog-form').dialog
[14:42:44] <geri> vertical scrollbar
[14:48:01] <Ales> overflow-y: scroll geri ?
[14:48:31] <geri> in the properties of the dialog?
[14:49:07] <Ales> in css geri
[14:49:20] <geri> i did that
[14:49:32] <geri> but the scrollbar is not visible by default
[14:50:02] <geri> see: http://ideone.com/Qx6DPd
[14:53:55] <geri> Ales: do you understand whats the issue?
[14:56:02] <Ales> geri add overflow-y: scroll to jquery dialog class in main dialog css class
[14:56:10] <Ales> probably #dialog-form
[14:56:40] <geri> Ales: i changed my code to: http://ideone.com/Qx6DPd
[14:57:59] <geri> Ales: is that what you mean?
[14:59:27] <introspectr> how can i use jquery to set the .val() of an input that is added to dom after page load?
[15:00:35] <taplar> it's the same as any other lookup and usage of val()
[15:01:28] <xai_beha> using jquery ui autocomplete, when i set minlength to 0, down arrow shows the options. customer wants search to start only after 3 chars have been entered, but i'd like to nevertheless show the options on downarrow (or at least 3 chars to search on).
[15:01:32] <xai_beha> is there a way to do that?
[15:02:22] <xai_beha> currently, minlength 0 -> downarrow shows options but also searches after first char entered; minlength 3 means search is correctly only after 3, but downarrow is also dead.
[15:07:18] <geri> Ales: any idea?
[15:07:36] <Ales> no geri
[15:07:42] <geri> :(
[15:23:39] <grimel> HI, all. I'm trying to use simple datepicker from jQuery UI but I'm really new to jquery. It works but it's not rendered properly. I mean - datepicker is shown but has no "background". What can cause such a problem?
[15:24:16] <grimel> It's something like transparent
[15:24:35] <europe-league> i've a question about jquery mobile, someone can help?
[15:25:42] <Uhkis> europe-league: not without asking
[15:26:29] <grimel> Got this. I forgot to include stylesheet.
[15:29:14] <europe-league> uhkis thank you. i've a page with 3 x data-role="header". can i programmatically add an header to a data-role="page"?
[15:29:46] <europe-league> to avoid cut n paste 3 times...
[15:30:01] <Uhkis> add a header?
[15:31:35] <europe-league> yes, i read this: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/widgets/pages/   section multiple pages template...
[15:33:36] <europe-league> i hope i ve explained correctly my problem...
[15:35:32] <Uhkis> yeah, i've never used jqm
[15:35:46] <Uhkis> but stick around, maybe someone will answer
[15:38:09] <grimel> btw, what's the easiest way to localize datepicker?
[15:40:12] <europe-league> uhkis maybe solution is this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6050384/dynamically-create-jquery-mobile-page-via-javascript-after-clicking
[15:40:31] <europe-league> or is a good starting point...
[16:08:55] <yottabyte> hi, I have functions that just perform ajax calls like function myFun() { $.get().done(); }. Can I use $.when(myFun1, myFun2); if I want to run myFun1 before myFun2? or should I put myFun2(); in the .done() of myFun1?
[16:09:35] <yottabyte> but myFun2 doesn't always need to run after myFun1 so I was trying to find the best practice for this sort of thing
[16:15:43] <shoky> if you don't need one before the other then using $.when is fine..   you need to pass it promises though, not functions
[16:15:50] <shoky> yottabyte ^
[16:17:37] <yottabyte> shoky: can you elaborate? something like var myDeffered = $.get(...);?
[16:18:38] <yottabyte> so function myFun1() { return var myDeffered = $.get(...); } and $.when(myFun1(), myFun2())?
[16:19:17] <yottabyte> what is the difference between $.when(a, b) and $.when(a).then(b)?
[16:24:40] <shoky> yottabyte:  you need to return the deferred/promise from the functions..  and the difference is that $.when(a,b) will wait for both to resolve in no specific order (i.e. in parallel), and $.when(a).then(b)  will only wait for b after a is resolved
[16:25:21] <shoky> though if b is a function call then you probably don't want to execute it right away
[16:26:01] <shoky> e.g.   doing $.when( fn1() ).then( fn2() )    both fn1 and fn2 will be called right away
[16:26:36] <shoky> because it's the same as:   var x1 = fn1(), x2 = fn2();  $.when(x1).then(x2);
[16:28:44] <yottabyte> shoky: so how do I return the deferred/promise? function myFun1() { return var myDeffered = $.get(...); } and then $.when(myFun1, myFun2)?
[16:29:19] <shoky> you just return it.    return var   is not valid javascript
[16:29:41] <yottabyte> return $.get(...)?
[16:29:44] <shoky> function myfn() { return $.get(...); }
[16:29:46] <yottabyte> ah
[16:29:53] <shoky> or:   var v = $.get(...);  return v;
[16:30:01] <yottabyte> and then $.when(myFun1, myFun2); without ()?
[16:30:03] <yottabyte> err
[16:30:04] <shoky> no
[16:30:13] <yottabyte> $.when(myFun1).then(myFun2)?
[16:30:15] <shoky> you want to call the functions probably
[16:30:20] <shoky> otherwise they won't run ;p
[16:30:27] <yottabyte> oh, ok
[16:30:32] <yottabyte> this stuff is pretty confusing
[16:30:57] <shoky> $.when( myfn1() ).then(function() { return myfn2() })
[16:31:00] <shoky> for example
[16:31:42] <shoky> don't really need to use $.when in this case
[16:32:04] <shoky> myfn().then(...)  does the same
[17:09:37] <harry1_> what's wrong with this: var display['root'][0] = blah;
[17:13:47] <shoky> you can't define a variable with that name, or in that way..
[17:22:34] <harry1_> shoky: thanks i tihnk i got it
[17:29:15] <Darren_> Hey guys http://pastebin.com/p6SbWZTD I'm trying to use MixItUp for content filtering. I have the js file added, I'm targeting in my main.js, I added the appropriate classes in my html, but I can't get the buttons to filter my content I have a live example here http://www.stepyouraimup.com/upcoming-games/
[17:36:25] <z1haze_work> anyone know if its possible when using the youtube embed to have a custom play button on the overlay?
[17:36:56] <mmmveggies> z1haze_work: doubt it, cause iframe
[17:37:49] <z1haze_work> yea, i didnt know if they had some sort of custom settings for the pro accounts or whatever, just going off what our client is requesting they act like its possible, ive not seen it
[17:38:05] <mmmveggies> I highly highly doubt it.
[17:38:20] <mmmveggies> It's a significant piece of branding
[17:38:21] <z1haze_work> they send mockups like this: https://gyazo.com/872b33a53e6d9c42cb6a6116f9b221b3
[17:38:33] <mmmveggies> not happening xD
[17:38:36] <z1haze_work> lol
[18:37:51] <holler> hello, I am having trouble getting an element with position: fixed to stay at the bottom of the screen when it's input comes into focus and the ios keyboard opens
[18:37:56] <holler> anyone have experience with this?
[18:38:25] <Duvdevan> does jQuery suck compared to Angular?
[18:40:07] <shoky> no
[18:43:39] <snover> those two things are not comparable.
[19:27:30] <leffs> hey, newbie here, i want to make an event listener for FancyProductDesigner#productCreate, but I don't understand how to put it in a function so I can fire and use the returned values, I know how to use stuff like FancyProductDesigner.function() but not as an event listner can someone please help? http://jquerydoc.fancyproductdesigner.com/classes/FancyProductDesigner.html#events
[19:28:10] <leffs> i just need the event listener to function outline I can plop in my page ~
[19:41:36] <leffs> all i'm looking for is how to listen, like $().on('fancyProductDesigner#productCreate', function(e) {});
[19:42:09] <leffs> here is sample, you can see the "output console" is listening similarly http://fancyproductdesigner.com/jquery/
[19:47:06] <MaXxer90> so do you want to bind the event on sth. or do you want to trigger the event? If you want to trigger it: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ could help
[19:47:33] <leffs> the .on function
[19:51:33] <snover> fwiw, you should never trigger events using `trigger`; instead, expose the logic in a separate function, and call that function directly.
[23:22:44] <jq> When building formdata can I use a file outside of an html form?
[23:30:06] <nicknamer> I know this is wrong channel, but does anyone know how I install a PHP class like https://github.com/stil/gd-text
[23:30:09] <nicknamer> I can not get it to work
