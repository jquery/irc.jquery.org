[00:29:52] <crab> heh, for arbitrary values of 32 :-)
[00:29:53] <crab> urk
[00:29:59] <rookie84> hello everone.
[00:30:12] <rookie84> <div class="widget"> 		<div class="widget-header"><a id="expand"
[00:30:18] <rookie84> how can i close the .widget class?
[00:30:39] <rookie84> $('#expand').click(function(e) { $(this).parent('.widget').hide('slow')
[00:30:40] <rookie84> isn't working ?
[00:32:59] <prurigro> rookie84: have you tried adding the same function to an onclick to see if that works?
[00:33:45] <rookie84> yes still no luck :(
[00:34:04] <prurigro> have you tried directly setting the display style to none?
[00:34:43] <rookie84> yes that works
[00:35:05] <prurigro> are you using jquery-ui?
[00:35:37] <rookie84> hmm just plain jquery stuff?
[00:36:23] <prurigro> interesting-- so the widget class is your own invention?
[00:36:40] <prurigro> oh duh
[00:36:45] <rookie84> yeh :)
[00:36:49] <prurigro> actually, I'll change that from duh to maybe
[00:36:56] <rookie84> let me change the class names anyway.
[00:37:06] <prurigro> but you're setting a span to disappear
[00:37:09] <rookie84> since it may not be my invention
[00:37:16] <rookie84> no
[00:37:18] <prurigro> well jquery doesn't add any classes
[00:37:21] <rookie84> its not a span but a div ?
[00:37:25] <prurigro> jquery-ui would have, which is why I asked
[00:37:32] <prurigro> you're setting it to effect expand
[00:37:32] <rookie84> yeh but i may be using that widget class somewhere maybe.
[00:37:34] <prurigro> which is the <a>
[00:37:49] <rookie84> $('#expand').click(function(e) { $(this).parent('.widget').hide('slow')
[00:38:08] <prurigro> <div class="widget">   <div class="widget-header"><a id="expand"
[00:38:15] <rookie84> <div class="widget"> 		<div class="widget-header"><a id="expand" href="">HTML</a>
[00:38:15] <prurigro> expand is your link
[00:38:22] <prurigro> oh
[00:38:22] <rookie84> yes correct?
[00:38:22] <prurigro> nm
[00:38:24] <prurigro> I see
[00:38:32] <prurigro> sorry, late :)
[00:38:43] <morficus> hey guys - when trying to make a request using $.ajax to a URL that is protected using Basic HTTP Auth, what is the best way to provide the proper credentials?
[00:39:07] <prurigro> oh hrm
[00:39:08] <morficus> is it using the "username" and "password" options? because those don't seem to be setting the proper headers
[00:39:17] <prurigro> should you have this instead of $(this)?
[00:40:04] <prurigro> nm
[00:41:00] <prurigro> rookie84: kk, can you try switching the contents of the function for alert("IT WORKED");?
[00:41:10] <rookie84> yeh that works :)
[00:41:45] <prurigro> and setting the display property to none works too eh?
[00:41:51] <prurigro> that means hide is specifically the issue...
[00:42:03] <rookie84> yes.
[00:42:19] <rookie84> $(this).parent('.widget-header').hide()
[00:42:21] <rookie84> works too :)
[00:42:35] <rookie84> but just after it hides it displays again, why?
[00:44:49] <rookie84> ok prurigro: it should be parents
[00:44:58] <rookie84> not parent if you want to go more than one level up
[00:45:10] <rookie84> now another issue is that just after it disappears, it appears again
[00:45:54] <prurigro> hmm, when is it supposed to reappear, if at all?
[00:45:58] <morficus> according to the API the "password" option is "A password to be used in response to an HTTP access authentication request." - but when I look at the headers, I see teh request being sent to http://username:password@URL
[00:46:24] <morficus> does this mean that the "username" and "password" options are not to be used when Basic HTTP Auth is protecting a URL?
[00:47:22] <rookie84> it is supposed to hide/disappear/close after the hide() occurs
[00:47:42] <rookie84> ie. never reappear
[00:51:58] <morficus> anyone?
[00:53:28] <prurigro> rookie84: can you get this to work without the rest of the backend of your site?
[00:53:41] <rookie84> ok i fixed this one as well
[00:53:54] <rookie84> another issue now is that if i have two divs = 2 widgets
[00:54:02] <rookie84> and i say $(this).parent('.widget).hide()
[00:54:05] <rookie84> it will hide both
[00:54:07] <rookie84> why?
[00:56:24] <rookie84> fixed this
[00:56:30] <rookie84> by setting default to prevent action
[00:58:57] <prurigro> how did you fix it rookie84?
[00:59:38] <rookie84> e.preventDefault()
[00:59:39] <prurigro> and are both widgets under the parent being hidden?
[00:59:49] <prurigro> interesting...
[00:59:51] <rookie84> no they're visible.
[00:59:54] <rookie84> still few issues
[01:00:07] <rookie84> #1, i'm using Sortable
[01:00:11] <rookie84> and connecting elements to the sortable like dragging them
[01:00:21] <rookie84> i want to be able to close a particular widget that i drag to the sortable
[01:00:26] <rookie84> how could it be done
[01:00:47] <prurigro> hmm
[01:00:54] <prurigro> you should use the sortable objects in jquery-ui for that
[01:01:09] <prurigro> they allow more obscure requirements like that
[01:12:34] <morficus> does jquery have a way to base64 encode a value?
[01:34:04] <phrearch> hey
[01:34:25] <phrearch> any idea why a dynamically generated imagemap like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/513447/ wont highlight?
[01:35:09] <Guest41902> in error callback of ajax, how do you call the response code e.g. 500 ?
[01:35:47] <Guest41902> instead of overridin the statusCode parameter when calling ajax
[01:45:39] <boaseter> Hey, im wondering something, i have an .aspx-page, and in the head i have: <script src="Scripts/jquery-1.6.4.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> , <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function () { ... and when running this i get $ undefined, however if i just refresh the page, this error doesnt appear again...
[01:45:47] <boaseter> What could cause that?

[02:36:55] <varnie> hello
[02:37:23] <varnie> what might cause strange delay during hiding div layer in $(document).ready ?
[02:38:32] <Zogot> strange delay when?
[02:38:47] <varnie> when that div layer gets hidden in $(document).ready handler
[02:39:07] <varnie> I see it half a second or so and after that it gets hidden
[02:39:23] <Zogot> It was my understanding that the document ready waits for the page to finish loading
[02:39:33] <Zogot> so if you want it to be hidden straight away, dont put it in the document ready
[02:39:47] <varnie> where should I put it then?
[02:39:53] <Zogot> outside it
[02:40:04] <varnie> it should be hidden immediately as soon as possible
[02:40:20] <Zogot> aye, so put it before the document ready line
[02:40:50] <jovrtn> $(document).ready is fired when the DOM has finished rendering
[02:41:33] <varnie> hmm, just commented out the other js scripts which nd now that item gets hidden immediately.
[02:41:51] <varnie> it seems some of these js scripts cause the delay.
[02:41:59] <varnie> maybe it does some hard job
[02:42:37] <jovrtn> external files load synchronously, so they'll block page rendering as they load in sequence
[02:42:57] <jovrtn> which would delay the execution of your code
[02:43:28] <Zogot> http://pastebin.com/JpsREpSp hows that code?  It works fine, but I'm still learning JS, and want to get rid of any bad habits
[02:43:43] <varnie> in other words my script waits until it gets executed?
[02:43:57] <jovrtn> it means that if you want it to load as quick as possible, put it first
[02:44:20] <jovrtn> but if it relies on jquery, for example, it will have to come after it
[02:47:38] <varnie> I put it out of $(document).ready anonymous-function and now it doesn't work
[02:47:45] <kollapse> Zogot: For more complex applications it would be best not to use stuff like "find('input[name=accountEmail]')" when there is an alternative. Just use an ID or class selector, they are much faster than attribute selectors.
[02:48:22] <Zogot> Ah awesome, exactly the kind of thing I was looking to hear
[02:48:24] <Zogot> thanks
[02:49:33] <kollapse> Also, you used find('input[name=accountPassword]') two different times. That means it has to search through the DOM two times. It would speed up things if you would declare a variable and use that.
[02:50:43] <Zogot> well didn't it mean that me storing the larger ID into a variable mean it doesn't search the DOM anymore?
[02:50:51] <Zogot> var login_widget = $('.login-widget'); that bit?
[02:51:15] <Sabixkl> help
[02:51:22] <Zogot> ?
[02:51:23] <Sabixkl> here's the problem http://pastebin.com/ZV1u0Fbd
[02:51:27] <Sabixkl> i'm using jqgrid
[02:51:34] <kollapse> No, I mean you used `login_widget.find('input[name=accountPassword]')` two times. Why not just once ?
[02:51:35] <Sabixkl> please check the line which has comment
[02:51:38] <Zogot> Sorry man, a little above my knowledge
[02:52:13] <varnie> is it possible to use "$('.photo').hide();" outside of document.ready handler?
[02:52:36] <Zogot> you can use anything outside the document.ready
[02:52:44] <Zogot> kollapse: fair enough, thanks :)
[02:52:49] <varnie> it doesn't work for some reason
[02:53:28] <varnie> maybe that div layer isn't loaded at that moment?
[02:54:08] <Zogot> Run through what it is your trying to do with it?
[02:54:22] <Zogot> Any reason CSS couldn't do it instead?
[02:55:18] <varnie> no reasons, but I don't understand what is wrong with my approach
[02:55:28] <kollapse> varnie: What does $(document).ready() do ? It waits for the DOM to load. Anything executed inside it is guaranteed to run once the DOM has loaded. Runing DOM-related code outside it may not work because they may refer to non-existant DOM nodes.
[02:55:53] <Zogot> kollapse: how to you not use find when you store something into a variable then?
[02:56:17] <varnie> if I put that $(.foo).hide() inside $(document).ready() then there will be short delay before that item gets hidden
[02:56:23] <varnie> this is my problem I am trying to solve.
[02:56:30] <kollapse> Instead of using .find() each time, just make a variable like `var a = myElement.find("...");` and point to `a` every time.
[02:56:57] <Zogot> ah, sorry, i mis-read your first comment
[02:56:59] <kollapse> varnie: As was said earlier, put the code as early on as possible.
[02:57:00] <Zogot> ignore me
[02:57:29] <varnie> but it should be intro $(document).ready() ?
[02:57:36] <varnie> into*
[02:57:55] <kollapse> varnie: "$('.photo').hide();" manipulates the DOM. Yes, you need to include it in the .ready()
[02:58:08] <varnie> I see
[02:58:12] <kollapse> Otherwise .photo may not exist when executing the code.
[02:58:29] <kollapse> As in, it may not have been loaded yet in the DOM tree.
[03:11:38] <varnie> I put it just after jquery and it still doesn't work as I want
[03:57:45] <eternity13> $(".doSmth").each(function(){doThis($(this));}); // how do i attach doThis to elements created by ajax, without attaching again to already existing?
[03:59:23] <muszek> hi... how do I select element's html? not html of its contents. for example I have <div id="foo">asdf</a> and I want to get the whole '<div id="foo">asdf</a>' string.  How do I do it?
[03:59:39] <muszek> .html() would get me just 'asdf'
[03:59:53] <muszek> $('#foo').html() would get me just 'asdf'
[04:00:14] <eternity13> muszek: put it inside another div and get it's html
[04:00:53] <muszek> eternity13: any solution without modifying html?
[04:03:18] <eternity13> muszek: dunno, im just a newbie :D
[04:03:25] <muszek> ok :)
[04:03:45] <crab> muszak: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419749/get-selected-elements-outer-html
[04:13:11] <eternity13> $(".doSmth").each(function(){doThis($(this));}); // how do i attach doThis to elements created by ajax, without attaching again to already existing?
[04:14:15] <crab> look at .live/.delegate and see if you can use one of them to accomplish what you want
[04:15:11] <donCams> crab, what is .on? somebody told me about that. i tried using it with the new jquery version. doesn't work
[04:16:03] <sahbeewah> it's the same thing as delegate, with the first two parameters switched around
[04:40:35] <eternity13> .live didn't help me
[04:42:09] <Haraldson> then you're doing it wrong
[04:56:24] <troubleman> hey

[05:42:47] <aleray> hi, I was wondering why the two following snippet of code don't act the same: http://dpaste.com/662303/
[05:43:24] <aleray> the first do log once where the second do log twice
[05:43:45] <aleray> (a typical html snippet is below)
[05:57:45] <gladosv2> hi, I have this html that gets added via ajax: <div class="cc_uitleg"><div class="cc_uitleg_href">Some text</div>
[05:57:46] <gladosv2> 	<div class="cc_uitleg_full hide">some other text</div></div>
[05:57:46] <gladosv2> and this jq in the $(function() {...}):
[05:57:46] <gladosv2> $(".cc_uitleg").on("click", function(event) {
[05:57:46] <gladosv2> 		$(".cc_uitleg_href", this).toggleClass('hide');
[05:57:46] <gladosv2> 		$(".cc_uitleg_full", this).toggleClass('hide');
[05:57:46] <gladosv2> 	});
[05:57:47] <gladosv2> but it doesn't work... the click event doesn't trigger. any ideas?
[06:02:43] <Zogot> tried $(".cc_uitlet").live("click", function(event){}?
[06:08:31] <gladosv2> yep, didn't work either
[06:10:17] <gladosv2> the error chrome's debug gives me is this:
[06:10:30] <gladosv2> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[06:11:24] <sahbeewah> are you using >=1.7
[06:11:59] <gladosv2> oh ***, i'm not... thanks

[06:34:13] <black_warlock> hi pepps
[06:34:30] <black_warlock> any shadowbox expert ?
[06:34:43] <black_warlock> i got problems with a gallery and i dunno how to solve
[06:35:19] <black_warlock> a slideshow within shadowbox , but the click on images doest work
[06:44:50] <juha_> black_warlock: check your error console, i'm pretty sure you have an error somewhere. either that or your selector is  wrong
[06:50:09] <black_warlock> i did it
[06:50:12] <black_warlock> no errors
[06:50:18] <easyrider> does any body know good irc room about PHP?
[06:50:23] <black_warlock> i guess its an error of inizialization
[06:50:38] <black_warlock> i made a fiddle
[06:50:51] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/f2eTB/8/
[06:51:53] <black_warlock> nice script ye ?
[06:52:05] <black_warlock> but shadowboxx popup doest work on pictures
[06:52:22] <black_warlock> i mean it works just on the first image and it happens sometimes
[06:53:32] <black_warlock> is it because the slider is setted on document.ready ?
[06:53:58] <black_warlock> and doesnt have the time to load the SB ?
[07:00:06] <Layke> Does jquery have anything which will help me here. I have a 500px div. Inside of it I have a 900px breadcrumb. When I move to the right, I want to make it so that the content that isn't visible scrolls into view.
[07:00:13] <Layke> The larger div has white-space:nowrap.
[07:02:21] <pen> 2011-11-20 23:43:17.557906 is it possible to convert this string to Date object?
[07:05:15] <sunscreen> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'done'
[07:05:34] <black_warlock> layke: just change the css property
[07:05:59] <pen> btw, the decimals are nano secs
[07:06:00] <Layke> black_warlock,  Yeah well I'm using white-space-nowrap, since I want to always ensure that it is all on one line.
[07:06:12] <pen> I do new Date(string) but it doesn't work
[07:06:14] <sunscreen> whats that error all about ^ keep running in to it..
[07:06:15] <pen> invalid date
[07:06:21] <Layke> black_warlock, So if my breadcrumb is 900px, and the container is 500px, then I have 400px which won't be in view.
[07:06:37] <Layke> So what I would like is to be able to move over the element, and have it scroll left or right.
[07:06:48] <Layke> black_warlock,  If that makes sense.
[07:06:56] <black_warlock> set the overflow on the 400px layer
[07:07:03] <black_warlock> overflow-y: auto;
[07:07:03] <black_warlock> overflow-x: hidden;
[07:07:07] <black_warlock> or vice
[07:07:27] <black_warlock> it hides the overflow in horizontal
[07:07:35] <black_warlock> and show the one in vertical
[07:07:52] <Layke> Sorry, by scroller, I mean, I want it to scrol via automatically moving. I think I'll just do the math and create it myself. What you are suggesting, will still require the user to click his mouse and drag right?
[07:09:05] <Layke> Image I have a 300px element. So I can split this into three areas. 100px (left) 100px(middle), 100px(right). The total content inside is actually 600px. So if the user hovers his mouse in the riht area, then it should scroll automatically the far right content into view.
[07:09:09] <black_warlock> so you need jquery scroller
[07:09:17] <black_warlock> onmouse over right ?
[07:09:20] <Layke> Yeah
[07:09:26] <black_warlock> this is what ya need
[07:09:28] <black_warlock> http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/
[07:09:40] <black_warlock> you  can also hide the arrows
[07:09:42] <Layke> Thanks. I tried Googling myself but kept coming up with carousel image scrolls.
[07:09:52] <black_warlock> nah it sux
[07:10:00] <black_warlock> this is good
[07:10:05] <Layke> Yeah that looks good.
[07:10:09] <black_warlock> you can set also in vertical
[07:10:43] <black_warlock> and can change the onmouse over area
[07:11:03] <Guest41902> how do we ajax post a file?
[07:11:48] <black_warlock> $.ajax({
[07:11:49] <black_warlock>   type: 'POST',
[07:11:49] <black_warlock>   url: url,
[07:11:49] <black_warlock>   data: data,
[07:11:49] <black_warlock>   success: success,
[07:11:49] <black_warlock>   dataType: dataType
[07:11:49] <black_warlock> });
[07:12:34] <black_warlock> file ?
[07:13:19] <sie> I'm using the datepicker from jquery ui and I've got to dynamically colour some of the dates, but the thing is inline style won't do since the html is recreated each time I press it(the date). I could recolour it every time it gets recretaed, but is there a way that'd be more sane?
[07:13:49] <sunscreen> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'done'   <--- why :(
[07:14:14] <Guest41902> black_warlock: yes,...multipart file
[07:15:13] <black_warlock> files cant be uploaded via ajax
[07:15:42] <sie> Is there some selector that looks at element's innerhtml?
[07:15:42] <black_warlock> you can use .load() to charge a page that execute a post "multipart/form-data"
[07:16:12] <sie> :contains()!
[07:16:21] <black_warlock> Sie : yes .htm()
[07:16:48] <black_warlock> if you want the content of a layer
[07:16:58] <sie> >selector
[07:17:33] <sie> .htm 1. isn't selector 2. does not exist
[07:17:41] <black_warlock> its just $(#divid").html()
[07:17:59] <Axilla> so i have some ajax when fades content in a div when a link is clicked.. it works perfectly fine when i visit localhost/blah.php
[07:18:10] <Axilla> but if i visit it online at myipaddress/blah.php
[07:18:17] <Axilla> all i get is the spinning waiting indicator
[07:18:29] <Axilla> and nothing ever shows up when a link is clicked.. anyone have any idea why?
[07:20:03] <black_warlock> you didnt load the library online
[07:24:23] <sunscreen> ha i was doing $("#bla").load("widget.php"); and it was buggering up $.ajax
[07:25:49] <sunscreen> ah i know why the widget is include jquery.js
[07:27:47] <black_warlock> Axilla: i dunno what are you talking about, but can be just 2 things 1 you didnt set the jq library or 2 - you didnt set up the inizialization code, you are missing files check the souce code online and click js FIles for the phisical path
[07:30:16] <Layke> What file am I missing with this error? .mousewheel is not a function
[07:30:39] <Layke> I'm trying to get the most minified versions I can, but can't even see what I should be invcluding to get mousewheel scrollable functions built into jquery
[07:34:58] <sunscreen> well that's unfortunate .. my widget was designed using jquery 1.2 and i am coding my site with 1.6 .. but when i put the widget in a iframe on the ver 1.6 page it breaks stuff .. and i tried putting noConflict();
[07:35:35] <tomasm-> hi, when i bind something to form.submit, how do I determine which submit buttons were pressed? or is that only possible by binding to the buttons being clicked?
[07:49:30] <BlaDe^> anyone got experience with SOP?
[07:53:35] <murosai> how can i select links which target (href) only end with certain extension?
[08:00:13] <armicron> murosai, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[08:00:45] <armicron> $('[href$="\\.html"]')
[08:00:54] <armicron> something like this
[08:01:21] <armicron> $('[href$=".html"]')
[08:01:53] <armicron> murosai, try last variant
[08:04:16] <tomasm-> hi, if i pass an Array object to a function, can that function call arrayname.push() to alter the original array for the caller?
[08:10:33] <cantonic> hey guys. does anyone here have experiences with HighCharts? (www.highcharts.com)
[08:10:40] <rookie84> i've a method i'm using with JuiSortable
[08:10:58] <rookie84> it doesn't work with other event handlers but with .live it works
[08:11:02] <rookie84> .live is deprecated
[08:11:08] <rookie84> .on <-- it doesn't work
[08:11:09] <rookie84> any idea?
[08:11:17] <cantonic> i have a problem with the xAxis of a Graph and explenation would be confusing if you have never worked with HighCharts :) Therefore I am asking wheather someone has experience with it
[08:11:32] <tomasm-> rookie84, show the syntax for .on() you're using... it's not so obvious how to create a delayed handler
[08:11:36] <belevele> hi, is there a jquery plugin to let me select more files to upload? [ but not upload them via ajax ]. i want to upload on submit. i have tried uploadify but it is based on ajax.
[08:11:36] <cantonic> rookie84: sorry, no idea :(
[08:12:21] <rookie84> cantonic: np
[08:12:42] <rookie84> tomasm: $('.nug-header .closeme').on('click', function(e) {
[08:12:58] <tomasm-> belevele, either you use flash, ajax, or have some fancy ajax that hides the field once it is changed and then shows another file field instead.... you either show a list before submit, or as one processes, you can choose another file to submit
[08:13:13] <tomasm-> rookie84, what is the element that is showing up after the page onload?
[08:14:06] <rookie84> hmm how do i check that?
[08:14:33] <tomasm-> belevele, I dont think there's a way to submit a file automatically unless it is ajax - unless maybe you bind an 'onChange' to the file that calls form.submit(), but my guess is that security wise it wont let you. worth a try, though
[08:14:58] <tomasm-> rookie84, hmmm, well try this instead: $(document).on('click', '.nug-header .closeme', function(e) { ... })
[08:15:12] <rookie84> yeh i tried this one too :)
[08:15:39] <tomasm-> the syntax you provide does nothing because there is no element to bind to yet.... all i can suggest is my syntax - beyond that it may be a deeper issue
[08:15:53] <rookie84> ok
[08:16:37] <rookie84> oh your syntax works, thanks
[08:16:47] <rookie84> i was enclosing document with ' (single quotes)
[08:16:48] <rookie84> my bad
[08:16:50] <belevele> tomasm-, is it impossible just to load them into a list and after upload them via php on submit? i dont want to add the images into my db via AJAX. i need jquery just to let me select more files to upload.
[08:17:12] <rookie84> tomasm: i'm using it with JuiSortable so i want an element to be closed when under the sortable area
[08:17:40] <tomasm-> belevele, after a file is chosen, you can have an event trigger creating a clone of the first file upload, let them choose another... and continue until they say 'submit', and submit like normal
[08:18:00] <tomasm-> rookie84, not familiar with JuiSortable, sorry
[08:18:15] <rookie84> yeh never mind, you helped me.
[08:18:16] <rookie84> thanks.
[08:19:24] <ryanneufeld> belevele: have you checkout uploadify?
[08:20:04] <tomasm-> belevele, $('input[type=file]').change(function() { $(this).clone().appendTo($(this).parent()); }) # essential idea, not sure if it works tho
[08:20:56] <belevele> ryanneufeld, yes, but it isnt the best option for my case. tomasm- thanks for your help, im gonna to try it. xD thats the idea.
[08:21:43] <ryanneufeld> belevele: make sure when you clone the element that you change it's name or else you will only get the last file uploaded
[08:33:17] <murosai> why doesn't $('a[href^=location.hostname]').addClass("external"); work?
[08:34:48] <ryanneufeld> murosai: do you have any links that have location.hostname in the href?
[08:35:28] <murosai> well the location.hostname part is wrong, firebug tells me there is an error
[08:35:44] <murosai> "unrecognized expression"
[08:35:55] <ryanneufeld> right
[08:36:01] <ryanneufeld> makes sense
[08:36:17] <murosai> i think you can't use variable like href=variable?
[08:36:21] <ryanneufeld> no
[08:36:25] <ryanneufeld> you can't ;)
[08:36:29] <ryanneufeld> not the way you've done it
[08:36:35] <murosai> so how should i d o it
[08:36:36] <murosai> do
[08:36:46] <ryanneufeld> murosai: you code in PHP normally don't you?
[08:36:52] <murosai> nope
[08:36:55] <ryanneufeld> ah
[08:37:51] <ryanneufeld> $('a[href^="'+location.hostname+"']').addClass("external");
[08:37:59] <ryanneufeld> you had two things wrong
[08:38:39] <ryanneufeld> 1) you should quote the string you're looking for
[08:39:11] <murosai> i thought quoting just meant we are passing a string
[08:39:16] <murosai> but ok
[08:39:22] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's what it means
[08:39:24] <nwksystems> hi
[08:39:29] <ryanneufeld> but you're passing a variable
[08:39:51] <ryanneufeld> and single quotes mean "pass these letters exactly as I type them"
[08:40:26] <ryanneufeld> murosai: javascript doesn't know that you want the value of location.hostname when you put it in the quotes like that
[08:41:05] <ryanneufeld> it assumes you wanted the string to be 'a[href^=location.hostname]'
[08:41:24] <ryanneufeld> where as you wanted something more like this:
[08:41:38] <ryanneufeld> say location.hostname was 'google.com'
[08:42:00] <ryanneufeld> 'a[href^="google.com"]'
[08:42:06] <ryanneufeld> that's what you expected
[08:42:17] <ryanneufeld> you got 'a[href^=location.hostname]'
[08:42:23] <ryanneufeld> murosai: got it?
[08:42:30] <ryanneufeld> nwksystems: welcome
[08:42:46] <murosai> yup
[08:43:02] <ryanneufeld> you have to build the string you're after
[08:43:11] <nwksystems> ryanneufeld: thanks!
[08:43:42] <nwksystems> what is the standard quote type to default too if it doesn't matter?  I always feel a little uncertain :}
[08:44:33] <murosai> ryanneufeld: alright i saw my mistake now
[08:44:37] <murosai> thanks
[08:44:51] <ryanneufeld> murosai: http://pastebin.com/B4VgY5JP check that out too
[08:45:07] <ryanneufeld> handy little bit of code we use to force external links to open in a new window
[08:45:15] <ryanneufeld> seems similar to your needs
[08:45:23] <ryanneufeld> nwksystems: doesn't matter
[08:45:30] <ryanneufeld> nwksystems: just be consistent
[08:45:59] <held> does anyone know if it's possible to send a last ajax request when the browser closes but WITHOUT showing the user any confirmation window, like here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5575472/detect-when-a-user-leaves-a-website
[08:46:18] <held> if i return anything else than null it shows a popup, and when I return null it just doesn't work
[08:46:31] <nwksystems> fair enough
[08:47:25] <ryanneufeld> nwksystems: we use php/js so our php we have a rule, '' for simple strings, and if we're using variables then we use ""
[08:47:37] <ryanneufeld> it's a convention we've adopted
[08:48:01] <ryanneufeld> but whatever works for you. As long as you understand that they work differently
[08:49:03] <ryanneufeld> held: I'm sure it's doable, but without seeing your code, I don't think I could be of any help beyond that
[08:49:24] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ held
[08:49:25] <bot-t1> held, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:49:50] <ohcibi> when doing a $.post(url, data, function (resp) { }); how to use only certain html-elements of resp like $.load('url identifier'); would do?
[08:50:10] <ohcibi> i tried $(data).find('#id'); but it wont find the element with id
[08:50:30] <ryanneufeld> that's the way to do it
[08:50:34] <nwksystems> ryanneufeld: I like that, I think I'll adopt yours
[08:50:38] <ryanneufeld> so something else is wrong
[08:50:45] <ryanneufeld> nwksystems: giver
[08:53:02] <ohcibi> ryanneufeld: ah... i misspelled the id ;) thx...
[08:53:36] <held> bot-t1: ryanneufeld: sorry for late reply, this is what I have http://jsfiddle.net/c6Me4/
[08:53:37] <bot-t1> held, Stored "ryanneufeld: sorry for late reply, this".
[08:54:23] <held> should have figured out bot is a bot :p
[08:54:57] <held> anyway, the code i posted here works if i return anything different than null http://jsfiddle.net/c6Me4/
[08:56:25] <cantonic> anyone here using HighCharts library?
[08:57:10] <ryanneufeld> held: bot-t1 is a bot
[08:58:21] <rookie84> have a question regarding Draggable, Sortable
[08:58:28] <rookie84> how can i change status of an element after it has been dragged into a sortable area?
[08:58:40] <ryanneufeld> held: why are you passing a function as the first argument to getjSON
[08:59:05] <ryanneufeld> rookie84: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[08:59:40] <ryanneufeld> held: that's probably why it's not working
[08:59:57] <held> ryanneufeld: basically my framework generates the request url inside that function
[08:59:58] <ryanneufeld> held: getJSON expects it's first param to be a usl
[09:00:04] <ryanneufeld> *url
[09:00:08] <held> so i'm sure that's not the problem
[09:00:11] <rookie84> ryanneufeld: thanks, looking into it.
[09:02:39] <ryanneufeld> held: my reduced test works just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/c6Me4/2/
[09:03:25] <ryanneufeld> held: what does #{jsAction @World.finalRequest() /} do?
[09:03:32] <ryanneufeld> I'm not familiar with that syntax
[09:04:58] <held> ryanneufeld: var cometQuery = function(options) {var pattern = '/world/finalrequest'; for(key in options) { pattern = pattern.replace(':'+key, options[key]); } return pattern }
[09:05:20] <held> that's the generated JS in the browser
[09:05:45] <held> ryanneufeld: it's code that is compiled serverside, the browser gets something else
[09:06:49] <ryanneufeld> held: you should be doing a hasOwnProperty check on the options in your for in
[09:08:06] <held> i'll look that up, thanks
[09:08:47] <ryanneufeld> held: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/c6Me4/5/
[09:09:06] <ryanneufeld> you see you function is expecting an object
[09:09:12] <ryanneufeld> containing some options
[09:09:16] <ryanneufeld> but you're never passing any
[09:10:15] <Whirl3d> does anyone have a suggestion for finding a list of images that I can load into jsfiddle for demonstration purposes? Google image search will work, but I would prefer a serial list ("image-1.jpg","image-2.jpg"), etc. if possible.
[09:10:16] <Marlinc> I'm having a problem with just a very small jQuery code
[09:10:43] <Whirl3d> ?ask@Marlinc
[09:10:44] <bot-t1> Marlinc, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:10:45] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[09:10:57] <Marlinc> I don't ask to ask:P
[09:11:01] <Marlinc> That was not a question
[09:11:25] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: Thats nice then
[09:11:49] <Marlinc> But okay at http://planning.digital-ground.nl/schedule/view/?id=3 when you click on the row that has the + a event should raise but it doens't I can't find out why
[09:12:09] <nwksystems> I'm having lots of problems with code, large and small :)
[09:12:33] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, you are my hero. Thanks, that's exactly what I was looking for.
[09:12:38] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: NP
[09:12:53] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: you haven't got any events bound to that element
[09:12:59] <ryanneufeld> it's not surprising it doesn't work
[09:13:30] <Marlinc> http://jsfiddle.net/G8q4E/
[09:14:12] <Marlinc> $().click(<function>) is used to create a event right?
[09:14:20] <held> ryanneufeld: so basically it's not necessary to return anything at all?
[09:14:34] <ryanneufeld> held: nope, also, you're doing it wrong with getJSON
[09:14:56] <ryanneufeld> if you have no options to pass passing an empty object is silly
[09:15:20] <ryanneufeld> just use the promise returned by $.ajax... so .done() or .fail()
[09:15:24] <ryanneufeld> cleaner that way
[09:15:41] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: I see exactly what your problem is.... see ?ready()
[09:15:41] <bot-t1> Marlinc, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[09:16:06] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: you see, your binding to an element that doesn't exist yet.
[09:16:12] <Marlinc> Ah
[09:16:18] <Marlinc> That makes sens
[09:17:00] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/G8q4E/1/
[09:17:19] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: also with jsfiddle you don't need the head or body tags :)
[09:17:43] <Marlinc> Okay thanks :)
[09:17:47] <ryanneufeld> Marlinc: np
[09:21:50] <ryanneufeld> held: how'd you make out?
[09:22:26] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: also checkout placekitten
[09:24:05] <held> ryanneufeld: still no change
[09:24:18] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:24:28] <ryanneufeld> can you update the fiddle with what you're trying?
[09:24:42] <ryanneufeld> make sure to hit update when you're done
[09:25:08] <held> last thing i tried was your code actually, right now i'm just staring at the code  :p
[09:26:01] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:26:08] <ryanneufeld> are there any errors in the console?
[09:26:36] <held> no, no errors
[09:27:14] <ryanneufeld> do you have persist log enabled?
[09:27:34] <ryanneufeld> so it will save the log between page navigation
[09:28:06] <held> no i don't, let me see where i can activate that
[09:28:26] <sunscreen> man why are all the dashboard gauges always got some quirks
[09:29:14] <ryanneufeld> held: in chrome, right click on the console
[09:29:26] <ryanneufeld> held: then you can try this code: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/c6Me4/6/
[09:29:31] <ryanneufeld> log out the url
[09:29:45] <ryanneufeld> make sure it's gonna give you what you're expecting
[09:29:55] <sunscreen> fusiongauges look all well good but the stench of flash!!! arrrhghg
[09:30:04] * sunscreen dons a gas mask
[09:31:09] <held> the console is now showing "/world/finalrequest" but my server still isn't receiving the request
[09:32:10] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, thanks for the great links.
[09:32:14] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: np
[09:32:24] <ryanneufeld> held: so you're not seeing an XHR?
[09:33:11] <held> ryanneufeld: not one pointing to world/finalrequest anyway
[09:33:30] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:33:56] <Whirl3d> I am trying to run a test case for using the selector ":last" to fire a callback once the last element in a collection has done ...something...and I can't get the test case to work, let alone testing it. Any advice would be great. http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/BvHM6/9/
[09:33:58] <ryanneufeld> no errors either?
[09:36:56] <held> ryanneufeld: no, nothing
[09:37:00] <murosai> how can i use variables in regexp match?
[09:37:32] <Whirl3d> murosai, can you give an example of what your are trying to regexp match?
[09:38:26] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/BvHM6/11/
[09:38:42] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: fixed, now see ?when
[09:38:42] <bot-t1> Whirl3d, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[09:38:48] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: and make it suck less
[09:38:55] <ryanneufeld> murosai: like I showed you before
[09:39:00] <ryanneufeld> murosai: you just build a string
[09:39:24] <murosai> this is different im using .match()
[09:39:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah, the concept is the same
[09:39:41] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, thank you once again.
[09:39:52] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: yes, now make it suck less and use when
[09:40:06] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: not that it sucks now, but it could suck less
[09:40:18] <ryanneufeld> murosai: see ?mdc RegExp
[09:40:19] <bot-t1> murosai, RegExp - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Creates a regular expression object for matching text according to a pattern. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[09:40:46] <ryanneufeld> murosai: using that you can build a regexp string minus the start and end /'s
[09:40:53] <ryanneufeld> murosai: then you pass that to your match() call
[09:44:21] <held> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/c6Me4/7/
[09:44:30] <held> even that isn't working without a return statement
[09:44:46] <ryanneufeld> held: something else is going on then
[09:45:13] <held> how so?
[09:45:36] <ryanneufeld> so you're saying that the alert isn't happening?
[09:45:54] <held> yea
[09:46:01] <ryanneufeld> held: try binding with jquery
[09:46:20] <murosai> return !$(this).attr("href").match(regexp);
[09:46:21] <ryanneufeld> $(window).on('beforeunload',unloadPage);
[09:46:26] <murosai> this means don't match the regexp right?
[09:46:46] <ryanneufeld> murosai: yes...
[09:47:07] <murosai> hm, if i remove the ! i get the same result

[09:47:57] <ryanneufeld> murosai: what's your new RegExp look like?
[09:47:57] <held> ryanneufeld: same thing, not working without a return, maybe it simply isn't possible
[09:47:57] <held> http://jsfiddle.net/c6Me4/13/
[09:47:59] <murosai> i messed up something else probably
[09:48:08] <ryanneufeld> held: what browser?
[09:48:58] <ryanneufeld> held: I'm not sure man
[09:49:25] <held> chrome
[09:49:28] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:49:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah, strange man
[09:49:34] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[09:49:46] <ryanneufeld> not really something I have a lot of exp with
[09:49:49] <ryanneufeld> keep googling
[09:50:25] <held> i'll probably need to try something else
[09:50:28] <held> thanks for your help!
[09:50:39] <ryanneufeld> np man
[09:51:44] <murosai> yeah the regexp was messed, problem solved
[09:54:10] <donssp> hi guys
[09:58:42] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, I redid my script using .when as per your suggestion, but the deferred is resolving immediately...http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/BvHM6/13/
[10:00:46] <richardr> Does anyone know a small Mustache.js plugin that helps load templates externally? E.g. from a templates/ folder. Quickly and easily so I don't have to nest too many $.ajax requests in my code.
[10:01:09] <richardr> I found a great plugin for jQuery Templates, tmpload, but unfortunately it depends on $.template which I can't seem to find
[10:01:42] <danzik17> Whirl3d: it's resolving because you're just passing a boolean essentially - you need to be passing an array of deferreds
[10:03:12] <Whirl3d> danzik17, thanks for the reply. I thought the idea was to pass a boolean deferred so that it fired when the boolean became true...
[10:03:45] <danzik17> Whirl3d: no, you'd pass something like $.when( deferred1, deferred2, deferred3 ).done()....
[10:03:49] <danzik17> when all 3 are done, it resolves
[10:04:32] <alexhanh> jquery ui tabs: how can I make it so that the anchor of the current tab is updated to the url?
[10:05:58] <Whirl3d> Then it seems weird to use .when in this context...in fact, it seems contrary to jquery's recursive nature to use a linear .when(item1, item2, item3)  rather than .when(collection).done....
[10:07:30] <danzik17> Whirl3d: you're forgetting about apply - you can use jQuery.when.apply( null, deferredCollection )
[10:07:36] <danzik17> to do exactly that
[10:08:06] <danzik17> but it may not be as straightforward, doesn't look like animate returns a Deferred
[10:08:37] <Whirl3d> right. I was just creating a single deferred (once all the images were hidden, then fire the callback)
[10:10:14] <siovene> Hi, I'm using latest jquery, and from my Django app I return the following to a $.ajax call: return HttpResponse(simplejson.dumps({'success': True}), mimetype='application/javascript')
[10:10:16] <Whirl3d> lol, it's tricky to lookup jquery .when
[10:10:31] <siovene> Still, the $.ajax call executes its error function, and not success.
[10:10:41] <siovene> Any idea?
[10:11:12] <danzik17> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/BvHM6/14/
[10:15:24] <Whirl3d> danzik17, thanks for your help. I guess that deferreds are overkill for this when I could just do a conditional callback: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/BvHM6/16/
[10:16:25] <Guest41902> how do you get pasted text in a paste event?
[10:18:19] <danzik17> Whirl3d: not really imo, i think Deferred are exactly what you want, but that's up to you - i personally use Deferreds all over the place
[10:18:54] <Whirl3d> what is the advantage to using a deferred here? I am new to deferreds, so any advice is greatly appreciated.
[10:20:36] <minna> How do i match an attribute value that is "-1" ?
[10:22:27] <Whirl3d> $(sel).filter("[attrname='-1']");
[10:23:18] <danzik17> Whirl3d: because it allows you a common API - the same API is used for all asynchronous functions whether you're doing an animation or an ajax call
[10:23:25] <danzik17> and it's trivial to implement thigns like this
[10:23:26] <danzik17> http://jsfiddle.net/BvHM6/17/
[10:23:34] <Guest41902> how do you get pasted text in a paste event?
[10:23:56] <minna> Whirl3d: Ah, silly me, thanks
[10:24:35] <minna> Whirl3d: And i guess you mean $('#silly[value='-1']'); right?
[10:26:10] <Whirl3d> minna, If you are trying to select the one "silly" element, only if it's attribute named "value" is equal to -1, then yes
[10:29:10] <Whirl3d> danzik17, thanks for the input. I will spend more time with deferreds to understand why that is better than: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/BvHM6/18/
[10:31:17] <Whirl3d> if (parseint($("#silly").val())==-1) { doSomething()}   ?
[10:42:54] <hdon_> hi all :) is there a good lib out there for manipulating document.styles?
[10:43:04] <hdon_> i mean, document.styleSheets
[10:44:14] <Whirl3d> danzik17, if I am creating a function that returns a deferred object and I have to code the return states (like progress, resolved, done, reject, error) within the function, it seems like deferred isnt really doing anything that a standard wrapper function with conditional output...
[10:45:13] <Whirl3d> It seems like the advantage to a deffered object would come in the sense that your promise definition DOESN't have to provide methods of returning the deffered callbacks.
[10:48:24] <danzik17> Whirl3d: you're also missing the idea that you can attach N number of callbacks to the Deferred's callback queues, and they do not all need to be passed in when the function is called
[10:49:14] <Whirl3d> aha! I get it now. So it's worth it to standardize the progress, resolve, and reject states this way.
[10:49:34] <Whirl3d> but why don't deferreds have a "start" and "pause" state?
[10:49:55] <danzik17> Whirl3d: start and pause?
[10:50:52] <Whirl3d> It seems like we are setting up a context for listeners...so why not add a start event callback, and a pause event callback as a standard part of a deferred object so N functions could be attached to those as well.
[10:51:18] <Vivid_> hi
[10:51:35] <Whirl3d> hello, Vivid, just jump in and ask your question.
[10:52:18] <Vivid_> how can I move an element on the page that is affected by scrolling up and down?
[10:52:47] <Whirl3d> you could use .position() to position the element relative to it's container
[10:53:18] <Vivid_> scroll down in the browser and a fixed position div would move up the browser and out of view basically
[10:54:02] <Whirl3d> why would you want that to happen? Can't the element be absolutely positioned?
[10:54:16] <Vivid_> hi whirl, yeah it could be absolute positioned
[10:54:39] <Whirl3d> then, scrolling down the page would scroll up the element, presumably...
[10:54:50] <Vivid_> it's an effect i'm looking create, not for usability
[10:55:12] <Whirl3d> perhaps you could setup a test case/example using jsfiddle.net
[10:55:32] <Vivid_> it's like little bubbles that vanish at a diferent rate to the background if you see what i mean
[10:56:01] <Whirl3d> why does the scrolling of the page affect them?
[10:56:31] <Whirl3d> You want them *not* to be affected by the scrolling of the page, maybe?
[10:56:47] * Whirl3d is confused
[10:57:08] <Vivid_> they would ideally slowly disappear ( at a different rate) kind of like a parallax scrolling effect
[10:57:58] <Whirl3d> Vivid_, are these bubbles affected by the scrolling of the page? In other words, are you simulating depth and perspective (as in parallax)?
[10:58:17] <Vivid_> yeah, that's what I should have said :)
[11:00:03] <Vivid_> i think you understand the effect i'm trying to create
[11:00:24] <Whirl3d> Vivid_, perhaps, rather than animating the elements, you could setup a sequential function that uses the scrollTop attribute of the document to determine the relative rate of movement
[11:02:07] <Vivid_> yes, sounds promising, where should i start with this, any pointers
[11:02:08] <Vivid_> ?
[11:03:00] <Whirl3d> gimme just a minute and I'll see if I can write something to get you started.
[11:03:09] <Vivid_> :)
[11:03:32] <Vivid_> is this jquery or just plain javascript I should be using?
[11:05:12] <Whirl3d> i'd use jquery
[11:16:43] <Vivid_> this page pretty does what i'm trying to achieve... http://www.kevinpruett.com/ just the #description h2 element
[11:20:10] <new2net> Child Selector (“parent > child”)   will work if the child is a DIRECT descendant.  I want to select something that's inside of parent, but all I know is its name="foo".  Is there a selector for this?
[11:20:37] <sanjayb> new2net: ("parent child")
[11:21:01] <new2net> So just get rid of the greater than character?
[11:21:04] <sanjayb> new2net, in your case, possibly something like $('#someform [name=foo]')
[11:21:06] <sanjayb> new2net, yes
[11:21:24] <coderzach> $("parent [name=foo]")
[11:21:40] <sanjayb> new2net, or cleaner maybe $('#form').find('[name=foo]');
[11:21:52] <coderzach> is that cleaner?
[11:22:17] <sanjayb> coderzach, actually, dunno :) - i tend to prefer .find in a case like that .. matter of style, i guess.
[11:22:41] <new2net> I'd say coderzach's is cleaner. But to be honest, both are so much better than having to change the DOM.
[11:23:10] <new2net> ill use them both, since I have multiple ones to select
[11:23:33] <KUL> $(".paging a").find('rel').attr(rel_math).addClass('active') <-- is this the right code?  I mean can we use .find to look inside an attr ?
[11:23:50] <sanjayb> KUL, that does not look right.
[11:24:00] <KUL> Yup I thought so
[11:24:00] <sanjayb> KUL, what are you try to do?
[11:24:28] <KUL> I want to add class = active to an element where rel = 1
[11:24:32] <sanjayb> KUL, your code is saying find all elements that are <rel>s inside $('.paging a'), which makes no sense:), since i doubt you have any elements called <rel>
[11:24:54] <sanjayb> KUL, $('.paging a[rel=1]').addClass('active')
[11:25:15] <sanjayb> (am assuming this is for <a>s inside something with class=paging )
[11:25:15] <KUL> wait I'll give it a try :)
[11:26:43] <KUL> yes Sanjay thats right
[11:27:13] <KUL> I mean my problem is not yet solved
[11:27:19] <KUL> 1 sec
[11:27:22] <sanjayb> KUL, lol, never is :P
[11:27:45] <danzik17> Whirl3d: took a few minutes since i've never looked at/used animation and queues before, but here:  http://jsfiddle.net/BvHM6/21/  .  i'm sure it can be done nicer as this is just a quick job.
[11:28:30] <KUL> sanjayb instead of 1 I have made 1 variable can i show it there ?
[11:28:42] <KUL> $('.paging a[rel=rel_math]').addClass('active')
[11:29:29] <sanjayb> KUL, $('.paging a[rel=' + rel_math + ']');
[11:29:30] <KUL> I know I can show it there.. But I'm failing with my syntax! :|
[11:29:38] <KUL> Oops I tried that
[11:29:43] <KUL> 1 sec lemme try once again
[11:31:21] <KUL> Yea sanjayb Thank u soo much :)
[11:31:31] <KUL> I was making mistake in my syntax!
[11:31:42] <sanjayb> KUL, cheers. yea, string concatenating is always a bit weirdo.
[11:31:59] <KUL> yup :) Cheers :)
[11:40:04] <tash> yesterday I was trying to do some jq ajax.  I realized I don't have a very good grasp of xhr, and I want to understand it better.  I read the docs, but am still confused...=\ Sorry.
[11:40:31] <tash> can someone explain to me, if I want to pass variables to a page, if I need to do that in the .get() ... like key: value
[11:40:55] <sanjayb> tash: um..
[11:41:28] <sanjayb> tash: $.get("/page/", {'key': value}, function(response) { alert(response); });
[11:42:09] <magcius> I usually use $.ajax manually
[11:42:54] <magcius> $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: '/page/', data: {'key': value} }).done(function(response) { alert(response); })
[11:43:25] <sanjayb> oo, .done() .. that's cool, didn't know about that :)
[11:43:42] <tash> so, if my page is expecting values for certain variables ( phone, date, msg ), would I do something like $.get("/page/", {'phone': value, 'date': value, 'msg': value}, function( response ) { alert(response); });
[11:44:10] <sanjayb> tash, yes.
[11:44:53] <sanjayb> tash: although I would recommend using $.ajax as well .. makes it easier to extend with an error handling function and such as well .
[11:44:53] <tash> and, if in my html form the elements have id's and names like 'phone', 'date', 'msg' ... how do I get the value to put in the get?
[11:44:58] <Guest89900> How do I .toLowerCase() in Mustache? E.g. same data, just presenting it differently
[11:45:09] <tash> sanjayb: ok
[11:45:18] <tash> I can certainly do that ... just trying to understand the basics
[11:45:18] <sanjayb> tash, if field has id=phone, $('#phone').val() to get that fields value
[11:45:31] <tash> ty, I'm going to test it out now.
[11:45:36] <tash> be back in just a few
[11:45:39] <sanjayb> tash, if name=phone, $('[name=phone]').val()
[11:45:41] <sanjayb> tash: BUT ..
[11:46:05] <sanjayb> tash, if you want to send the entire contents of a form .. look up the form .serialize() and .serializeArray() methods to serialize an entire form ..
[11:48:47] <igcewieling> this appears to work: $('#route_edit select option[value=suspended]').attr('selected','selected');    It seems to me this will select any select/option pair with an option value of "suspended".  How would I make sure this only applies to the option with name="blah"
[11:49:24] <igcewieling> would it be $('#route_edit select[name=blah] option[value=suspended]').attr('selected','selected'); ?
[11:50:29] <ajpiano> igcewieling: $("#route_edit_select[name='blah']").val("suspended")
[11:50:49] <ajpiano> you can use .val("foo") to set a select box
[11:51:24] <coderzach> $('#route_edit select option[value=suspended][name=blah]')  no?
[11:51:36] <ajpiano> that makes even less sense
[11:52:14] <ajpiano> he wants to find the option with a particular value inside of a select with a particular name, not an option with a particular value and name.
[11:52:19] <coderzach> you want the option with value suspended AND name blah, right?
[11:52:26] <coderzach> oh
[11:52:35] <ajpiano> oh, well, you're right, he typed that
[11:52:36] <ajpiano> :)
[11:52:39] <igcewieling> thanks!  I'll give it a try
[11:52:45] <ajpiano> but i assume that was probably an erro
[11:53:02] <igcewieling> I don't care what I'm finding, as long as the correct option is selected.
[11:53:07] <ajpiano> lol
[11:53:18] <igcewieling> I'm still a bit of a jquery n00b.
[11:53:19] <coderzach> yeah, it was probably an error, because I don't think options can have names
[11:53:21] <ajpiano> definitely avoid finding out more about the problem !!!
[11:53:42] <tash> sanjayb: thanks for the last tip
[11:54:07] <trunkmonkey> hey, ya'll. i'm trying to use jQuery to select some li's from a drupal view. there's multiple ul's, all with the same classes. I tried: $(".view-newslide-page ul li:gt(2)").hide(); and that works great except it hides ALL the li's after the the 3rd, even in seperate uls. any hint on how I can get more specific so it targets each ul individually?
[11:54:08] <igcewieling> something else must be wrong, the moment I set set a 2nd select none of my code runs
[11:55:05] <tash> so, I tried the .get but the page seems to not be doing any async.  I want my page to appear as if it isn't "refreshing" or going to another page.  I want the server to do the action and just alert the user that it is done.
[11:55:23] <ajpiano> tash:  are you sure that th request is successfully making it to the server
[11:55:31] <sanjayb> tash, can you please paste your code somewhere ( jsfiddle.net ) ?
[11:55:55] <tash> here is the .ajax ... http://pastie.org/2929820
[11:56:11] <sanjayb> tash, if you're firing the event from an <a> element or a button inside a form, you have to remember to do something like $('#foo').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ..... });
[11:56:14] <tash> yeah, it is making it to the server. In the server I'm doing a print_r($_REQUEST)
[11:56:21] <tash> and it is printing the arrary
[11:56:24] <tash> array*
[11:56:46] <sanjayb> tash, can you post the code where you're actually triggering the ajax request ?
[11:57:30] <coderzach> truckmonkey: $(".view-newslide-page ul").find("li:gt(2)").hide(); might work
[11:57:39] <dimitris5> hi guys, can you help me? I have this code http://pastebin.com/5C0Djh09 I want to do all this but with an fadein effect, how i do it?
[11:58:42] <trunkmonkey> nice one, coderzach. that did the trick
[11:59:13] <coderzach> cool :-)
[12:04:03] <sanjayb> dimitris5, first, .hover() needs to be passed 2 functions - first to execute on hover over, and second on hover out ..
[12:06:06] <dimitris5> sanjayb: you are right, let me fix it
[12:07:01] <sanjayb> dimitris5, but in general, do you want to animate the colour changes as well, or just change $('#blood').css("display", "block"); to $('#blood').fadeIn(); should make #blood fade in instead of just displaying ...
[12:07:33] <dimitris5> sanjayb: i want to animate everything, the backround color also
[12:07:40] <dimitris5> sanjayb: here is the new version http://pastebin.com/hdrpgbqX
[12:08:01] <sanjayb> dimitris5, for colour animations, i think you need to include the jquery color animation plugin.
[12:08:34] <sanjayb> dimitris5, then it would be as simple as $('body').animate({'backgroundColor': '#000'});
[12:08:45] <sanjayb> dimitris5, look up the .animate() jquery method for additional options, etc.
[12:09:55] <sanjayb> dimitris5, and instead of using display:none and display:block on the #blood element, you may want to use opacity:0 so you can animate to opacity:1
[12:14:12] <sanjayb> dimitris5, http://pastebin.com/0UBXLC7M
[12:15:04] <dimitris5> sanjayb: the animate option is not working , take a look http://home.dakulov.eu:85/404/
[12:15:57] <sanjayb> dimitris5, for colour? you have to include jquery.color.js
[12:17:21] <sanjayb> hmm .. can't seem to find jquery color plugin on plugins page any more .. hmmmm ...
[12:20:27] <dimitris5> sanjayb: i found it, check it out http://home.dakulov.eu:85/404/
[12:20:37] <dimitris5> sanjayb: now i have to animate the image change
[12:20:46] <sanjayb> dimitris5, that maybe a bit more complicated ;-)
[12:21:13] <sanjayb> dimitris5, one way is to have two different images with the same position, and fade one out, and the other in ..
[12:22:14] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/ - what's the best way to keep the main links in #ddd while their dropdowns are hovered?
[12:34:34] <dimitris5> sanjayb: hmm now the positioning is crap http://home.dakulov.eu:85/404/
[12:35:59] <sanjayb> dimitris5, lol - yes, because now the img is absolute positioned and the text would either need to be absolute positioned also below the image or something like that
[12:36:25] <sanjayb> dimitris5, since now the image is no longer in normal document flow, etc. the text does not know to start correctly after the image ..
[12:38:41] <sanjayb> dimitris5, or put the <img> tags in a container that is position relative, and the images within that position absolute, and then the text after the container div or so
[12:40:17] <dimitris5> sanjayb: i will fix it, the problem now is to sync the fade effect. Both of them are set to "slow"
[12:41:25] <dimitris5> sanjayb: if i use transparent outline in the image this will fix the problem right?
[12:41:58] <sanjayb> dimitris5, uh, not sure what you mean by transparent outline .. i dont *think* so ?
[12:42:57] <sanjayb> dimitris5, not sure how to make it sync exactly .. try using values in ms instead of "slow", like 1000 for the animation to take 1 second .. ?
[12:44:27] <dimitris5> sanjayb: wow that worked! Thank you
[12:45:57] <sanjayb> dimitris5: np, cool 404 page :)
[12:46:19] <dimitris5> sanjayb: thanks :)
[12:54:14] <jbrokc_> how do I get a certain element(s) of a return jquery Array without turning them into DOM elements (ie - still jquery objects)?
[12:58:04] <sanjayb> jbrokc_, paste code? you *should* be able to treat jquery objects as jquery objects even if they are not in the DOM .. ? tho not sure exactly what you mean ..
[12:59:32] <jbrokc_> $("foo") i get back 3 jquery objects in an array. how do I get the second one and keep it as a jquery object? $("foo")[0] == dom element, $("foo").get(0) same thing
[12:59:35] <jbrokc_>  /cc sanjayb
[13:00:10] <sanjayb> jbrokc, $('foo').eq(1)

[13:04:12] <hdon_> i'm trying to use <col> and i'm using a w3c example from spec, but it's not working :(
[13:04:21] <hdon_> quizme: hm?
[13:04:27] <quizme> innerXHTML?
[13:04:35] <hdon_> quizme: with jquery you just use .html()
[13:04:43] <hdon_> quizme: but innerHTML is how it's done at the browser level
[13:05:16] <sanjayb> hdon_, have not used <col> .. but, you don't seem to be closing the tag .. is that okay?

[13:10:31] <quizme> i want something like (""+ $('#bob')) == "<div id='bob'><span class='mommy'>hi mom</span></div>"
[13:11:26] <sanjayb> quizme, seems like you need something like outerHTML() ...
[13:11:37] <quizme> i'll try it thanks sanjayb
[13:12:22] <sanjayb> quizme, err .. not sure thats standard / in jquery really .. but try googling jquery outerHTML , there seem to be a few solutions / threads ..
[13:12:40] <quizme> thanks a lot
[13:12:49] <quizme> the javascript version is what i want
[13:13:10] <hdon_> quizme: http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[13:14:25] <quizme> hdon_ thnq
[13:16:32] <quizme> they should put that in jquery
[13:18:10] <sanjayb> hdon_, not sure if this helps you: http://www.bramstein.com/projects/column/
[13:18:47] <kul> How to get the attr of last tag ? for example I have multiple <a> tags in a div. <a rel="1">,<a rel="2">,<a rel="3">,<a rel="4">,<a rel="5">..<a rel="10"> so I would like to have value of rel of last <a> which is 10 for this example tag how can I get that in jquery?
[13:19:27] <t1m_> hey guys, i have got a problem, i want some images to be draggable. this should be restricted to a div... the code i wrote just refuses the dragging if the middle of the dragged picture is out of the div, i want it to refuse, if anything of the picture slips out of the div. the code: http://pastebin.com/LQ9HYreW
[13:20:11] <kul> hehe sorry  i got it
[13:20:12] <kul> var last = $('.paging a:last').attr('rel')
[13:20:23] <hdon_> sanjayb: that's basically waht i'm doing right now. just wanted to do it cleanly with pure CSS and HTML
[13:20:49] <sanjayb> hdon_, yea, im a bit zapped that there isn't a cleaner way to do this.
[13:21:08] <hdon_> sanjayb: well the w3c specified a way. it just doesn't work :|
[13:21:29] <sanjayb> hdon_, how about <colgroup> ?
[13:28:36] <hdon_> sanjayb: maybe. i haven't been able to make it work :(
[13:30:54] <sanjayb> hdon_: a bit silly, but http://www.search-this.com/2007/04/11/styling-table-columns-with-css/ ?
[13:34:54] <t1m_> *last push*, i have got a problem, i want some images to be draggable. this should be restricted to a div... the code i wrote just refuses the dragging if the middle of the dragged picture is out of the div, i want it to refuse, if anything of the picture slips out of the div. the code: http://pastebin.com/LQ9HYreW
[13:37:37] <sanjayb> t1m_, have you tried the 'containment' option, or is that not applicable?
[13:38:14] <t1m_> sanjayb: i have thought about that, i cannot use it without a big restructuring of my html... would be my last option to try
[13:40:37] <sanjayb> t1m_, k, then not sure - have not used the grid option u seem to be using .. if u have a page to look at, can look, but doubt would be able to help, actually.
[13:41:20] <t1m_> sanjayb: would have to make an account for you... i will try a few more minutes, probably you will have to then ;)
[13:42:12] <sanjayb> t1m_, lol, no no .. its actually 3 am here, im prolly passing out soon ..
[13:51:58] <Flobin> Hi everyone, I was hoping someone could perhaps point me to a tutorial on how to make a form that's not a full contact form, but one where all you do is leave your email and have it sent
[13:52:07] <Flobin> if anyone knows any, that'd be awesome
[14:18:29] <black_warlock> hello
[14:18:39] <black_warlock> im using .load() method
[14:18:56] <black_warlock> to pass some variables via querystrings
[14:19:23] <black_warlock> but if my variables has a white space inside the script breaksdown
[14:19:35] <black_warlock> how to solve it ?
[14:20:18] <coderzach> black_warlock: GET or POST ?
[14:20:27] <black_warlock> its a get
[14:20:50] <black_warlock> .load () its not always get isnt it ?
[14:21:00] <black_warlock> $('#re_user').load('annunci/asp-validator.asp?tipo_controllo=usercheck&valore='+$(this).val());
[14:21:47] <black_warlock> if the $(this).val() has space the script will interrupt
[14:21:54] <black_warlock> instead i wish to validate it
[14:22:00] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/ - what's the best way to keep the main links in #ddd while their dropdowns are hovered?
[14:23:18] <coderzach> black_warlock: if the name attribute of the element is valore then you can do $('#re_user').load('annunci/asp-validator.asp?tipo_controllo=usercheck&'+$(this).serialize());
[14:23:33] <JesperA> i love cake
[14:23:42] <black_warlock> its an input field
[14:24:17] <sanjayb> black_warlock, something like escape($(this).val())
[14:24:35] <sanjayb> black_warlock, or do validations on $(this).val() before running .load(..) ...
[14:24:56] <black_warlock> yessa
[14:25:08] <black_warlock> its escape
[14:25:18] <black_warlock> now it reads the white space
[14:29:35] <black_warlock> but serialize its also better
[14:29:54] <black_warlock> with escape it doesnt print values like àè'òù
[14:30:09] <black_warlock> hum
[14:30:12] <black_warlock> whats the difference ?
[14:30:20] <black_warlock> just curiosity
[14:31:44] <quizme> how do you make sure there is only 10 <li> elements in a <ul> list ?
[14:31:58] <quizme> 10 or fewer elements
[14:31:59] <coderzach> serialize uses encodeURIComponent instead of escape
[14:32:07] <chee> where are all the coldheads
[14:32:21] <shesek> quizme, you make sure you only create 10 <li> in the <ul>?
[14:32:28] <coderzach> $("#myUl > li").length
[14:32:58] <quizme> shesek hmm
[14:33:10] <shesek> quizme, I don' really understand your question... if there shouldn't be more than 10 <li>, don't create more than 10 <li>s
[14:33:33] <quizme> shesek i mean what if there were like 1000 and you only wanted 10
[14:33:38] <Schumacher> mhh, why can't i put a variable inside a selector ? :S ;
[14:33:42] <Schumacher> $('#'+val).AddClass("error");
[14:33:59] <quizme> shesek like in a chat window
[14:34:03] <Flobin> Hey everyone, I'm trying to create a form where all people do is leave an email address and it's sent to our email, using php and jquery. I took a tutorial for a jquery + php contact form, which worked great and now I've been editing it, and since I'm a noob at this, I've broken it. I was wondering if anyone could either help me or perhaps point me in the direction of a tutorial or something
[14:34:03] <Flobin> that is more along the lines of what I need.
[14:34:06] <quizme> like this one
[14:34:18] <quizme> you don't want to scroll to infinity due to finite memory
[14:34:42] <quizme> and you always want to add lines
[14:34:59] <quizme> and you just wanna make sure that some extra lines didn't sneak in somewhere
[14:35:06] <quizme> so you wanna delete extra ones
[14:35:53] <shesek> quizme, well, you can do something like `items = $('#container li'); if (items.length > 10) items.eq(0).remove()`
[14:36:04] <shesek> to make sure it doesn't go behind 10
[14:36:25] <shesek> or change it to a `while` loop if you think there might be more than one extra
[14:36:38] <shesek> (which shouldn't happen if you add this test right before inserting a new row)
[14:37:34] <quizme> how about with while
[14:37:50] <sanjayb> Schumacher, you can. except that'd be $('#' + val).addClass("error");
[14:38:24] <quizme> shesek thanks that helps
[14:39:19] <quizme> while ($('#container li').length > 10){ $('#container li:first-child').remove() }
[14:39:25] <quizme> i think that does it
[14:39:46] <Schumacher> thanks sanjayb an A instead of an a, made the difference.. ..
[14:40:04] <sanjayb> Schumacher, you mean a instead of A, but yw anyway.
[14:40:36] <shesek> quizme, running two selectors for every execution can get somewhat resource-intensive
[14:40:59] <shesek> especially on browsers without native CSS queries support that fallbacks to Sizzle
[14:42:43] <black_warlock> well thanks for halps !
[14:43:32] <Deele> cmon, he is so mean... holmes.freenode.net sets mode: -o Deele
[14:46:39] <pvivek> #jqueryui
[14:48:28] <pvivek> how to format in datepicker? in the sense i want to format the it as yy-mm-dd . how to format it? I checked the example in jqueryui website . But when i tried it didn't work . i would be very glad if someone can help me out
[14:50:25] <kkuno> hi I need to open a php file using ajax
[14:50:42] <kkuno> and add the content of the file to the DOM
[14:50:59] <kkuno> which datatype should I use?
[14:51:57] <Flobin> hey everyone, I'm a noob who got a php + jquery form working, so I'm kinda proud
[14:52:16] <Flobin> now I'm wondering if there is a way to display the "email sent" message in a better way using jquery
[14:52:26] <Flobin> maybe so that it doesn't have to reload the whole page, is that possible?
[14:52:31] <Deele> kkuno, if that's html document, then default, no specific data type needed
[14:52:33] <coderzach> Flobin: more details
[14:53:02] <Flobin> well, the form is here: http://viastedebouw.nl/event/index.php
[14:53:21] <Flobin> and what else would you need to know?
[14:54:20] <Flobin> it's basically just a really simple php contact form
[14:55:22] <pvivek> i got it :)
[15:04:11] <linoge> so, i'm trying to make a simple login screen with jquery. It posts the form to a php page that tries to connect to a database or dies if data is incorrect. Now, i added a .success and a .error to $.post , but no matter if i enter incorrect info and the php script dies. Jquery thinks everything is ok. I'm misssing something here... could you help me out?
[15:05:08] <sanjayb> linoge, paste code? in general, I then use $.ajax with 'error': callback  ..
[15:05:46] <coderzach> Flobin, just use $.post and then replace #contactForm with the result
[15:06:06] <linoge> sanjayb: this is the jquery part: http://pastie.org/2930597
[15:06:31] <linoge> i already tested the php script and it dies if info is incorrect
[15:09:34] <sanjayb> linoge, define 'dies' - what does the php script return? if it doesn't return an http code like 404 or 500 or something, i don't think .error() will be fired ..
[15:10:00] <linoge> sanjayb: well... die(); ?
[15:10:25] <sanjayb> linoge, er, i don't think that would count as an error for the jquery code
[15:11:14] <sanjayb> linoge, you'd either have to die properly, or just return something like 0 from php and check in your success function if (response == 0) { .fadeIn()... ; }); or so ..
[15:11:51] <sanjayb> linoge (sorry, not written php in a while, would have to check how to return a proper http error code .. )
[15:11:59] <linoge> sanjayb: mmm, neither do i. If i open developer tools in chromium it shows the returning state of the php script as OK. Well, i'll test with it :). Thanks, i have like half an hour stuck here.
[15:12:21] <linoge> i'll check how to return an error code like 404 and test it
[15:12:32] <linoge> at this point i just want it to work :)
[15:15:25] <sanjayb> linoge, maybe easier to just return some string in the php and check for it with an if statement in your success handler .. although returning an http error code is probably the 'correct' way to do it ..
[15:18:26] <linoge> sanjayb: how can i check the returning string?
[15:18:46] <linoge> sanjayb: don't know, it works with the header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error');
[15:19:04] <linoge> but i would like to know how to access the response
[15:19:09] <sanjayb> linoge, yes, if u send a 500 back, it will trigger error
[15:19:22] <sanjayb> linoge, .success(function(response) { alert(response); });
[15:19:33] <sanjayb> same with .error(...)
[15:20:19] <linoge> sanjayb: perfect, much thanks my friend :D.
[15:30:49] <MariusKarthaus> I'm requesting data from a PHP serverside script using $.ajax, the script sends back json encoded data with a headers set to application/json. Jquery parses this data correctly and I get my object. However chrome complains: Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/json. What am I doing wrong ?
[15:48:54] <richardr> Architectural question: I have a plugin that essentially renders some API through Mustache templates. So different templates can b e defined, almost like widgets. Some of these widgets have events, so as per normal I create a jquery event listeners to 'onclick' or something in the template, no problems. My problem comes in when I want to UPDATE a widget or APPEND new items to a widget. How should I handle this?
[15:49:11] <richardr> Once the widget is created I have no more reference to it, and the templates define header/footer structure not only the items
[15:51:12] <quizme> slidetoggle snaps at the end when my <ul> goes from display:block to display:none?.. is there a way to prevent the "snap" ?
[15:53:53] <zoidfarb1> Does anyone have suggestions for how to programmatically reproduce dragging a JqueryUI draggable onto a sortable list? (preferably with animation)
[15:56:02] <coderzach> zoidfarb1: use jquery.animate to move it and then use jquery.appendTo to ACTUALLY put it in the list
[16:00:14] <kanzie> is there anything particular I should think about to use serialize()? I have a form and inside it I have a table. When I click a button I do serialize on the form-id however it returns empty
[16:01:17] <zoidfarb1> coderzach: that sounds pretty good. What if I want to insert it into the middle of the list? Can I trigger the move-out-of-the-way behavior of the sortable?
[16:06:33] <Afflicto> Hey all
[16:07:40] <Afflicto> I'm scripting a forum. I'd like to enable certain html tags but escape all php and scripts etc. Any way to do that
[16:08:45] <coderzach> zoidfarb: you could use insertAfter, and they'll move out of the way
[16:09:40] <kanzie> is there anything particular I should think about to use serialize()? I have a form and inside it I have a table. When I click a button I do serialize on the form-id however it returns empty
[16:11:32] <Afflicto> Shit I just realized I'm not in #php. sorry! ;D
[16:19:45] <kanzie> answer to my own question, "make sure you have a name-attribute on each input
[16:24:12] <zoidfarb1> coderzach: thanks for the advice! I'll give it a shot with insertAfter and see how it goes
[16:25:45] <yurakeshi> I'm using jquery.webcam to take a picture and upload to the server with asp.net. The aspx handler receives the byte array but it doens't make an image. The converter throws an "Param is invalid" error. Any helps is aprreciated. Thanks
[16:40:36] <yurakeshi> I'm using jquery.webcam to take a picture and upload to the server with asp.net. The aspx handler receives the byte array but it doens't make an image. The converter throws an "Param is invalid" error. Any helps is aprreciated. Thanks
[16:42:28] <bonhoffer> if i have <div id="bob" style="display: none; ">ted</div>, should $("#bob").show change the display to visible
[16:43:24] <bonhoffer> in the console, i get function (c){if(l(c))return t...ments);a[1].mode="show";return t... if I thype $("#bob").show
[16:43:52] <bonhoffer> no idea what the if(l(c))return this._show . . . response is all about
[16:49:45] <sanjayb> bonhoffer: you get that in your console because you're using minified jquery. but then problem is somewhere else -
[16:49:56] <sanjayb> bonhoffer, you need to do $('#bob').show() for one :P
[16:50:21] <sanjayb> bonhoffer, and it will change display to 'block' in that case, i think.
[17:02:58] <shadi_> I have a question about jQuery/AJAX/PHP. May I ask it here?
[17:03:12] <coldhead> please do
[17:04:40] <shadi_> you know in CAPTCHA implementation, a server sends the CAPTCHA image to the client, client shows it, gets the answer entered by user, client sends the answer to the server, and server processes the answer
[17:05:15] <shadi_> I need to do the same thing, but in my case, server sends several images t the client (instead of just one)
[17:05:46] <shadi_> so, my php file should create several (e.g. 10) images, sends to the client
[17:06:50] <shadi_> client (jquery) shows them, makes some interaction with people, gets some info from them and sends them to server (php) to be processed
[17:07:03] <shadi_> I do not know how to implement this.
[17:07:05] <amh345> I'm beginning to the the accordion lib is not what i need.
[17:07:44] <shadi_> I would appreciate any help
[17:08:32] <amh345> what's the best way to have a hidden div at the bottom of the page appear and slide up to the top of the page- pushing the div above it up and offscreen?  like the tumblr.com homepage
[17:11:49] <Scott0> whats the best way tog et the # minutes since the beginning fo the day?
[17:12:31] <shadi_> any idea?
[17:14:05] <ChrisPartridge> Scott0: getHours*60 + getMinutes from a date obj should do it
[17:14:18] <coldhead> which part are you stuck on shadi_ ?
[17:15:06] <coldhead> if you can get the images to the browser you want to use ?ajax // to send the user input back to the server, and the server can respond to that with a success or failure message
[17:15:07] <bot-t1> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:17:30] <shadi_> I am stuck on sending and receiveing images between client and server
[17:20:02] <shadi_> @coldhead: I don't know if server should just send strings containing the name of the images or the real images? and how?
[17:21:03] <coldhead> shadi_: you can send a list of URLs for the images and have javascript wrap them in lovely <img> tags for you
[17:21:18] <Hopsy> do we have a jeffrey way here?
[17:21:39] <coldhead> OR you can have the server build the HTML with the <img>s and javascript can just dump that in the page
[17:21:41] <Hopsy> no?
[17:21:54] <coldhead> not that i know of Hopsy
[17:22:18] <Hopsy> he is a fool, http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/editorials/are-jquery-users-fools/
[17:22:31] <Hopsy> paul_uk from the other channel want to smack him lol :')
[17:22:54] <Hopsy> read that article :')
[17:23:01] <coldhead> i shall!
[17:23:50] <shadi_> I know that one way is having this expression in client code: <img src="captcha.php" />
[17:24:51] <shadi_> and php creates the picture like: $im = @imagecreatefromjpeg("captcha.jpg");  Header ('Content-type: image/jpeg'); imagejpeg($im,NULL,100); ImageDestroy($im);
[17:24:56] <kba> anybody got experience with datatables? I can't seem to figure out how to properly format my json output in order for datatables to accept it. This is my current output: {"0":{"id":"46283","country":"Romania"},"1":{"id":"46157","country":"Poland"}}
[17:25:28] <kba> I've tried with this as well [["46283","Romania"],["46157","Poland"]]
[17:26:11] <kba> and [{"id":"46283","country":"Romania"},{"id":"46157","country":"Poland"}], etc. etc.
[17:26:24] <Hopsy> coldhead: did you finished?
[17:26:31] <kba> But dataTables just says "Loading..."
[17:27:56] <coldhead> no i am not finished! this is lonnng
[17:28:22] <Hopsy> kba: do you have any errors in firebug?
[17:29:16] <black_warlock> sanjayb are you there
[17:29:33] <kba> Hopsy: I'll have to install that, wait a minute
[17:30:26] <black_warlock> guys is it normal that .serialize gives the input name="itsvalue"
[17:30:42] <Hopsy> kba: and also, there should be some examples on the website of datatables
[17:30:48] <black_warlock> the result its like "user=pip"
[17:31:03] <Hopsy> kba: http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/server_side/scripts/jsonp.php
[17:31:06] <kba> Hopsy: I found one, and I feel like I'm formatting it a lot like it. But I don't get any errors
[17:38:50] <bonhoffer> sanjayb, thanks!
[17:40:51] * paul_uk thinks coldhead is a slow reader
[17:40:53] <paul_uk> :P
[17:41:12] <danzik17> paul_uk: so why do you disagree with whats said there?  curious.
[17:41:39] <bonhoffer> but a frustration remains, I am doing $.get("/foo/", {}, function(a) { alert(a)}); i am able to see the response, a 200, with the right stuff
[17:41:46] <bonhoffer> but the alert doesn't run
[17:41:51] <coldhead> slow AND at work dealing with CEO mondayitis
[17:41:58] <bonhoffer> there is a successful ajax request
[17:42:11] <b0x> *cough* console.log not alert *cough*
[17:42:15] <paul_uk> danzik17, cos he's aiming the article at designers and putting the blame of bloated/shitty/bad jquery code at their door.
[17:42:15] <coldhead> i am boiling with rage at his dragging religion into it
[17:42:18] <coldhead> idiot
[17:42:47] <bonhoffer> b0x, i'll do console log if i can figure out why the function isn't running
[17:43:23] <paul_uk> plus what pissed me off the most was this: What these copy and paste addicts (I was one of them)
[17:43:56] <paul_uk> talk about writing an article from the pov of an utter noob
[17:44:07] <paul_uk> an ignorant one at that
[17:44:12] <bonhoffer> responseText is full
[17:45:11] <coldhead> you should be required to surrender a testicle if you ever write "Compare this to simple Math."
[17:45:32] <Hopsy> lol omg
[17:46:10] <coldhead> i don't know if i have the strength to finish reading this
[17:46:43] <danzik17> paul_uk: he's not talking about jquery at all at that point, he was talking about javascript prior to jquery
[17:46:51] <bonhoffer> any insight why this doesn't work: $.get('/foo', function(a){ console.log('foo'); }) <-- the url is loading correctly, no errors
[17:47:17] <bonhoffer> the only way i got around this was to render json, and that forced a success event
[17:47:23] <richardr> If I have an object, say, $(this.element), how would I find the 'footer a.more' element within that and bind a click event to it? Thanks
[17:47:32] <shesek> bonhoffer, define 'not working' ?
[17:47:32] <coldhead> he is talking about how many golf balls he can insert into his body at one time
[17:48:04] <bonhoffer> shesek, sorry for ambiguous ?, console.log('foo') does not run
[17:48:09] <bonhoffer> the function is not called
[17:48:23] <paul_uk> danzik17, sure but he is still keeping that premise throughout the article when talking about jquery
[17:48:36] <Scott0> why would var currentDate = new Date(); console.log(currentDate); give me "Date" ?
[17:48:40] <shesek> bonhoffer, any errors in the console? does the XHR request show up there?
[17:48:57] <bonhoffer> despite no errors, a 200 status and the correct responseText -- no errors in the console
[17:49:01] <bonhoffer> i'm typing this in the console
[17:49:17] <paul_uk> danzik17, and I'm not the only one.  In the comments: JQuery is awesome, but can cause nasty problems with the ‘copy and paste’ types.
[17:49:34] <bonhoffer> shesek, i have the full object, how can i find the XHR request?
[17:49:44] <paul_uk> Jeffery Way needs to be punched several times by several people in the balls
[17:49:48] <bonhoffer> i'm using rails and it is supposed to have the correct headers
[17:50:17] <shesek> bonhoffer, what browser you're using?
[17:50:21] <bonhoffer> chrome
[17:50:51] <bonhoffer> same behavior in firefox
[17:52:09] <bonhoffer> shesek, any thoughts?
[17:52:58] <shesek> bonhoffer, under the New tab, you have a sub-tab that says XHR or XmlHttpRequest or something like that
[17:53:06] <bonhoffer> yes
[17:53:07] <shesek> Check there if the request is sent
[17:53:19] <Hopsy> vladikoff: hey
[17:53:19] <crab> what's the preferred slide-making-thingy these days?
[17:53:40] <Hopsy> ?logs
[17:53:41] <bot-t1> Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[17:53:54] <bonhoffer> shesek, yes i have the request -- one sec
[17:54:17] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1398768
[17:54:29] <Hopsy> hmm, drupal problems
[17:55:29] <Hopsy> bot-t1 tell vladikoff lampoon.gurpartap has some drupal installation issues :(
[17:56:44] <bonhoffer> shesek, this works: $.get('url', {}, function(a){ console.log('foo'); }, 'html')
[17:56:50] <bonhoffer> so i needed to specify the content
[17:58:18] <shesek> bonhoffer, that doesn't make sense
[17:58:30] <bonhoffer> i wish it did
[17:59:02] <shesek> and the request log you gave me is of an POST request, not get
[17:59:22] <shesek> can you paste the rest of the (relevant) code?
[17:59:29] <bonhoffer> Request Method:GET
[17:59:56] <bonhoffer> right? i'm new to this side of the code
[18:00:54] <shesek> Oh, you're right, my bad
[18:01:30] <shesek> so $.get('url',callback) doesn't work, but $.get('url',callback,'html') does?
[18:01:50] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1398768
[18:01:52] <bonhoffer> more code
[18:02:24] <bonhoffer> well, what you said is true in the console, and more specificially, $.get('url', {}, callback, 'html') <-- works
[18:02:49] <bonhoffer> but that is just with a trivial example, not my real code --i'm still getting trouble there
[18:04:37] <bonhoffer> shesek, yes, in the console: $.get("http://localhost:3000/my_fit_wit/leader_board/4ed291affdffdc49a6000005", function(a) {alert(a);},'html'); <-- works
[18:05:03] <yurakeshi> I'm using jquery.webcam to take a picture and upload to the server with asp.net. The aspx handler receives the byte array but it doens't make an image. The converter throws an "Param is invalid" error. But i can't findout  Any help is aprreciated. Thanks
[18:05:04] <bonhoffer> but without the html it doesn't -- now to get my production code working
[18:05:11] <Hopsy> lol paul_uk I asked in the #drupal channel where to began with drupal, they send me this image: :( http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfojlzGHJ01qdpu1qo1_500.png
[18:05:40] <paul_uk> lol
[18:05:45] <shesek> yurakeshi, sounds like a problem on the asp.net side of things, I doubt you'll find any help here
[18:05:51] <bonhoffer> it is all working shesek
[18:05:52] <paul_uk> drupal/joomla/et al.  all need to die in a fire
[18:06:03] <shesek> bonhoffer, what kinda of data is returned?
[18:06:24] <bonhoffer> html data
[18:06:44] <bonhoffer> so it does make sense that jquery was "intelligently guessing" incorrectly
[18:06:46] <bonhoffer> (to me)
[18:07:08] <bonhoffer> right?
[18:07:21] <shesek> seems like it
[18:07:28] <shesek> no errors on the console, at all?
[18:10:27] <ParadoxQuine> if I have a click handler for each element in a specific div, would it be faster to get an attrib of that div by doing $("#divid").attr("someattr") or $(this).parent("#divid").attr("someattr")?
[18:13:03] <bonhoffer> shesek, no errors -- that is a pain
[18:14:53] <vladikoff> Hopsy, :o
[18:16:41] <Hopsy> yes vladikoff?
[18:51:06] <lduros> hello, anybody knows a website that uses GOOGLE CDN to load Jquery or another library
[18:51:19] <lduros> i'm trying to find a site that does, just making a little experiment
[18:51:38] <ryanneufeld> I know of a couple
[18:51:49] <ryanneufeld> what's your experiment?
[18:52:23] <ryanneufeld> rather I know of one
[18:55:06] <Sabixkl> I need help whose work with jqgrid here?
[18:55:13] <Sabixkl> who's* rather
[18:55:44] <lduros> ryanneufeld: was just trying to know what sort of values they are gathering on that external script that uses the api key
[18:55:59] <lduros> if they are gathering data for statistical use
[18:56:19] <ryanneufeld> we're not using any api key for including it
[18:56:38] <lduros> ryanneufeld: ok, Google says you **need** to but technically you don't
[18:57:09] <lduros> ryanneufeld: the actual <script src='[url]'> seems to be cached for a long time
[18:57:19] <lduros> so the browser wouldn't make a request to the server everytime
[18:57:24] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:57:33] <ryanneufeld> it depends on which one you use
[18:57:38] <lduros> yeah it makes a request every time or yeah it doesn't?
[18:57:48] <lduros> ryanneufeld: like? :-)
[18:57:52] <ryanneufeld> they return cache headews
[18:57:58] <ryanneufeld> headers
[18:58:10] <lduros> ryanneufeld: for jquery for instance I get: Â  Cache-Control: public,max-age=31536000
[18:58:15] <lduros> so it would be cached for a while
[18:58:22] <ryanneufeld> so if you have http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.7.1.min.js
[18:58:33] <lduros> yeh there's a big max-age for this one
[18:58:34] <ryanneufeld> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[18:58:37] <ryanneufeld> that one
[18:58:47] <lduros> yeh
[18:58:49] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:58:58] <lduros> but they say you also need to put that jsapi file
[18:58:59] <ryanneufeld> what about this one: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js
[18:59:07] <lduros> http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#prototype
[18:59:08] <ryanneufeld> not if you use those ones
[18:59:08] <lduros> in there
[18:59:15] <ryanneufeld> http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[18:59:22] <ryanneufeld> we don't use it
[18:59:26] <lduros> UNder "Load the API"
[18:59:31] <lduros> I know, many seem not to use it
[18:59:37] <lduros> but google sorts of tells you you should
[18:59:37] <ryanneufeld> they have a loader API
[18:59:40] <lduros> so i'm wondering
[18:59:45] <ryanneufeld> that you can use it
[18:59:46] <lduros> that if you actually include that one
[18:59:46] <Sabixkl> I need help who has work with jqgrid here?
[18:59:52] <lduros> if it starts tracking some stuff
[18:59:53] <lduros> on the page
[19:00:04] <lduros> with: <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi?key=INSERT-YOUR-KEY"></script>
[19:00:20] <lduros> it seems to use a variable name userLocation
[19:00:21] <lduros> etc
[19:00:38] <ryanneufeld> lduros: yeah, google likes to collect lots of data
[19:00:50] <ryanneufeld> but we use analytics and their CDN for loading jquery
[19:00:54] <lduros> ryanneufeld: i'm mostly interested in sites that would include that script with the api
[19:00:55] <ryanneufeld> www.metrolyrics.com
[19:01:00] <ryanneufeld> oh
[19:01:02] <lduros> ryanneufeld: ok, thanks :-)
[19:01:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah, we don't do that
[19:02:10] <lduros> hehe
[19:02:42] <b1llydev> with jquery, how do you make sure that at least 1 item is selected within a multi <select> element?
[19:12:31] <tome> Hi all, is http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation a strongly recommended validation plugin, or is there a different one that's more recommended?
[19:13:00] <tome> (i'm having some issues with the validation code and I wanted to double check I'm spending my time debugging in the right place)
[19:13:51] <crab> is that the bassistance.de chap's plugin? that one is as close to strongly recommended as i've seen
[19:15:34] <tome> crab: yes, it appears to be, great, then I'll go through the work of debugging my issue (min/max on html element isn't converted to range). Much appreciated.
[19:16:22] <igcewieling> What might cause a .click() handler to fire multiple times.  The issue seems additive, first click() is fired twice the 2nd click() fires three times, etc.
[19:16:40] <igcewieling> I am still a novice.
[19:17:20] <crab> i take it you're not clicking multiple times? :-) what does your click handler look like?
[19:17:42] <crab> (paste to a pastebin)
[19:17:46] <matsebc> igcewieling: If I had to bet on something, you are adding a listener to the click event on your handler
[19:18:26] <igcewieling> crab: http://pastebin.com/cWjQCAHS
[19:19:35] <igcewieling> I'm sure I've encountered this before, but I don't remember when and what I did to solve it.
[19:20:27] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: When are you running that code?
[19:20:33] <Eviltwin> Oh, well
[19:20:38] <crab> btw, shouldn't you return false from your top-level click handler too?
[19:20:40] <Eviltwin> You're also binding the submit every time
[19:20:58] <Eviltwin> It's almost never right to bind a listener inside another listener
[19:21:09] <Eviltwin> Unless you're creating new elements and binding to them
[19:21:48] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: not sure I understand the question, this code is in $(document).ready()
[19:22:45] <Eviltwin> Okay, well as you have it right now
[19:22:49] <igcewieling> should I drop the .submit() since I'm handling that?
[19:23:11] <Eviltwin> Is the save button the submit button?
[19:23:18] <igcewieling> yes
[19:23:25] <Eviltwin> Then drop the click wrapper
[19:23:30] <Eviltwin> Just use the .submit
[19:23:32] <igcewieling> but I want a refresh-less submit
[19:23:51] <Eviltwin> Returning false from the submit handler will do that
[19:23:55] <Eviltwin> There's no need for the click handler
[19:24:31] <igcewieling> I'll try that.  thanks.
[19:26:42] <igcewieling> dunno why I thought I needed a click handler
[19:27:38] <tome> Hi, is the metadata plugin included with jquery? Is there something specific I need to do to activate it in that case? I see validation uses it, and I'm not sure it's enabled.
[19:35:08] * tome found a version on github
[19:50:52] <BILLY_> anyone around?
[19:51:02] <BILLY_> i'm having the weirdest time with a form
[19:51:32] <Eviltwin> Just ask your question
[19:52:01] <BILLY_> i build a form with post method so that when a user finishes registering they can click submit (disguised as a link) to go to their page with their login details already attached
[19:52:13] <BILLY_> when i make it a method=get
[19:52:14] <BILLY_> it works
[19:52:16] <BILLY_> when it is post
[19:52:17] <BILLY_> it wont
[19:52:31] <BILLY_> i have the pther page listing the entier $_REQUEST
[19:52:33] <BILLY_> but nothing shows
[19:53:19] <BILLY_> any ideas?
[19:53:53] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a #php problem, not a #jquery problem
[19:54:10] <Eviltwin> Did you try looking at $_POST ?
[19:54:15] <BILLY_> post is empty too
[19:54:39] <BILLY_> what's weird is that i have another trick post form working on another page
[19:54:50] <BILLY_> so my server is capable of handling it
[19:54:59] <BILLY_> and both are built on the fly
[19:57:09] <b0ot> If you try to do a loop to create a table in html in a each(data.foo, function(i,data){...add row...} loop does it create a seperate table for each row?
[19:58:19] <BILLY_> @b0ot is that directed at me? i do a form validation where i serialize the data and it is showing up fine
[19:58:21] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Can you paste actual code to pastebin or something and link it here?
[19:58:34] <Eviltwin> What you've written doesn't even have matching brackets
[19:58:35] <BILLY_> haha
[19:58:36] <BILLY_> sry
[20:17:40] <b0ot> Eviltwin,  sorry it took me awhile to code an example
[20:18:15] <b0ot> Eviltwin, http://codepad.org/sQifwdfY
[20:18:21] <b0ot> Why wouldn't this work
[20:19:01] <SudoKing> i'm having a hard time changing the value of a checkbox in my form -- when i run $('#checkbox1').text('description'); the description of the checkbox doesn't change ?
[20:22:13] <coldhead> do checkboxes have text?
[20:22:15] <Eviltwin> b0ot: You may want to look at something like jQuery template or tmpl
[20:22:43] <coldhead> SudoKing: you sure you shouldn't be changing a label next to your checkbox?
[20:23:02] <Eviltwin> b0ot: If the table already exists, why are you making a new table?
[20:23:07] <Eviltwin> And putting it inside
[20:23:08] <SudoKing> mm.. i didn't have a <label
[20:23:18] <SudoKing> just between >description goes here</input>
[20:23:26] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Also this isn't like PHP
[20:23:55] <Eviltwin> .appendTo() isn't like writing out more HTML
[20:23:56] <SudoKing> i've tried .text(), .html(), and .innerHTML
[20:24:16] <b0ot> Eviltwin, When I look at the page... the top of the table defined in start shows up as a seperate table. The main compoments of the table in the loop seem to come out alright, and i'm not sure what happenes with the end=</table>
[20:24:31] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: Add a <label for=...>
[20:24:50] <SudoKing> Eviltwin: hmm, ok. how will i change the label though, since it doesn't have an id?
[20:25:10] <b0ot> for example the table border only shows on the row with the category names
[20:25:15] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: Then give it an id?
[20:26:56] <Eviltwin> b0ot: You probably want something more like this: http://pastebin.com/Vntse961
[20:27:14] <Eviltwin> Seems like you may not completely understand how the DOM works
[20:27:48] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Also you may want to look at <th> tags instead of doing <tr><b>
[20:28:01] <dogarrhea2> why does my relatively positioned element not move when i change the height of something via javascript?
[20:28:04] <Eviltwin> <td><b>*
[20:28:15] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: That's *SO* vague
[20:28:17] <b0ot> Eviltwin,  trying it now
[20:28:31] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Can you make a jsFiddle example?
[20:29:42] <b0ot> Eviltwin, So I never actually have to define the table?
[20:30:14] <Eviltwin> b0ot: What's #theTable?
[20:30:22] <b0ot> a div
[20:30:45] <Eviltwin> ...
[20:31:09] <b0ot> It was defined in the bottom of that paste I sent you
[20:31:23] <b0ot> <div id="theTable" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px"></div>
[20:31:47] <Eviltwin> b0ot: http://pastebin.com/KuckZuzK

[20:35:21] <mdaisuke> Does somebody know in what situation jqXHR.status return zero?
[20:35:37] <Eviltwin> mdaisuke: If you're using the file:// protocol for one
[20:35:51] <Eviltwin> If the response isn't complete yet
[20:36:50] <mdaisuke> googling shows when it's unreachable or cross site scripting
[20:37:09] <Eviltwin> It should hit your error handler in that case
[20:37:27] <mdaisuke> right
[20:37:46] <dogarrhea2> hrm. bottom:0px should make the child element go to the bottom right?
[20:38:15] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Dude, jsFiddle example
[20:38:25] <dogarrhea2> bah jsfiddle is so annoying
[20:38:34] <dogarrhea2> what's the minimum you need?
[20:38:42] <dogarrhea2> do you need a full html page with doctype andeverything?
[20:38:46] <mdaisuke> Or in other words, how can I tell the ajax error by network or other server error?
[20:39:04] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: No, there's an implied <html><head>...</head><body>...</body></html>
[20:39:38] <tome> Hi, sorry to re-ask but I'm not sure of the answer yet: what's the best way to get the latest metaData plugin (which I think is used by plguin/validate)? The github one seems to be out of date, but I can't find the up to date one on the jquery plugin site, probably because I don't know what to look for.
[20:40:43] <dogarrhea2> where can i find images
[20:40:47] <dogarrhea2> for jsfiddle use.
[20:42:29] <dogarrhea2> damnit this jsfiddle is taking too much time
[20:42:47] <Eviltwin> mdaisuke: http://jsfiddle.net/U54Y4/
[20:42:54] <Eviltwin> mdaisuke: Can I see your code?
[20:43:16] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Google
[20:43:40] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: The reason for jsFiddle is so that we can see the whole issue, play with it, and hopefully solve your problem
[20:43:43] <b0ot> Eviltwin, I made those changes... and now nothing shows up
[20:43:49] <b0ot> I'm double checking my syntax
[20:43:59] <aidan> How can I make this chunk of code work in 1.7: http://dpaste.com/662551/
[20:44:03] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: You should try to make easy for us to help you otherwise we won't help you
[20:44:11] <aidan> I get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'html' of undefined
[20:44:12] <dogarrhea2> yea i know it takes so much time to set one up
[20:44:20] <dogarrhea2> it's ridiculous. i would rather try to solve it by myself
[20:44:56] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Then solve it yourself :P
[20:45:43] <Eviltwin> aidan: Which one of those .html's
[20:45:53] <aidan> Eviltwin: the outer one causes the error
[20:46:13] <Eviltwin> If $(breadcrumb[key]).attr('class'), that could cause that problem
[20:46:17] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:46:19] <Eviltwin> If $(breadcrumb[key]).attr('class') is undefined
[20:46:24] <Eviltwin> Try running just that if you can
[20:46:24] <aidan> Eviltwin: removing that whole line then gives an addClass error
[20:46:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah, it's probably because you're doing .attr('class', undefined) and it thinks you're trying to get the class
[20:46:53] <hightekvagabond> Are methods using callbacks such as $.ajax using eval or is there a more elegant way to pull off a callback?
[20:46:55] <aidan> Okay that fixes it (removing the attr('class)
[20:47:02] <aidan> Eviltwin: ah I see!
[20:47:13] <Cataclysm> is it bad to use json to submit passwords? its is right? okay i know that, but what should i do instead.
[20:47:19] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: They're not using eval...
[20:47:27] <mdaisuke> Eviltwin: wait a moment
[20:47:41] <Cataclysm> i'm trying to login and am using serialize() to test the credentials.
[20:47:48] <Eviltwin> Cataclysm: Really you should be using HTTPS to send passwords
[20:48:02] <aidan> Eviltwin: great pickup!
[20:48:03] <Eviltwin> Cataclysm: But using JSON to send it is really no different than a form POST
[20:48:17] <Cataclysm> Eviltwin .. dang.. this is an open app so i cant depend on https
[20:48:25] <Eviltwin> Cataclysm: Then just use the JSON
[20:48:30] <Eviltwin> Don't use GET though, use POST if you can
[20:49:04] <Cataclysm> Eviltwin .. well at least should i encode the password
[20:49:20] <Eviltwin> Cataclysm: It's not really worth it, whatever method you use to encode will be in the source of the page
[20:49:28] <Eviltwin> And someone can easily reverse engineer it
[20:49:41] <Cataclysm> im scared
[20:50:18] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/Lsyrj/  anyways. jsfiddle is ignoring my width/height
[20:50:41] <dogarrhea2> whoops forgot px
[20:50:47] <aidan> Eviltwin: is there an better fix than http://dpaste.com/662553/
[20:50:47] <dogarrhea2> the joys of coding twice
[20:51:21] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/Lsyrj/1/

[20:54:53] <mdaisuke> I meant in a situation like iPhone doen't have network access then hit error handler
[20:54:57] <dogarrhea2> where does the javascript live? head? body?
[20:55:04] <Cataclysm> Eviltwin : worth using jCryption?
[20:55:06] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Generally head
[20:55:16] <mdaisuke> Eviltwin: I meant in a situation like iPhone doen't have network access then hit error handler
[20:55:31] <Eviltwin> Cataclysm: They're typing the password in the browser and JavaScript is encoding it for transmission to the server?
[20:55:57] <Cataclysm> Eviltwin : correct
[20:56:10] <Eviltwin> Presumable decodable on the other end?
[20:56:48] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/Lsyrj/2/ dun know. i think it should alert [Object object]
[20:57:08] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Have you written jQuery before?
[20:57:28] <Cataclysm> Eviltwin : i would be able to, yes. it's a Magento extension and I need to tap into the Magento login controller
[20:57:36] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/Lsyrj/3/
[20:57:46] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Also, see ? alert
[20:57:47] <bot-t1> dogarrhea2, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[20:58:26] <dogarrhea2> oh yea. forgot to put a closure
[20:58:33] <Eviltwin> Cataclysm: Unless you're using public key encryption, there's not really any worthwhile encryption
[20:58:43] <Eviltwin> Nothing that can't be easily reverse-engineered
[20:58:46] <dogarrhea2> anyways this is why jsfiddle annoys me. i have to copy paste code and it's so annoying/double development
[20:59:13] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Unless your whole page is like 12 lines, it's not really doubled
[20:59:21] <Eviltwin> And if it is, it's not really a page
[20:59:43] <Eviltwin> The goal of jsFiddle is not to reproduce your page, it's to reproduce your issue
[20:59:48] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ dogarrhea2
[20:59:49] <bot-t1> dogarrhea2, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[20:59:53] <b0ot> works now!
[21:00:06] <b0ot> thanks Eviltwin my syntax mistake (as you prob expected :p)
[21:00:19] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Heh, could easily have been me
[21:00:28] <Eviltwin> I didn't actually run that
[21:00:29] <b0ot> ah this is so much sexier
[21:01:09] <Eviltwin> b0ot: You're welcome :P
[21:02:16] <bananasontoast> Hey guys, more of a js question but hoping someone can help. How do I make a function wait for callbacks to finish before returning a value? And on that topic, how do I deal with scope inside function callbacks? Here is a code sample, but unfortunately it won't be able to actually run since it's a private APIâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/mitchmalone/89gNa/
[21:03:25] <Eviltwin> b0ot: You can't make a function wait for a callback
[21:03:28] <Eviltwin> Err
[21:03:33] <Eviltwin> bananasontoast: You can't make a function wait for a callback
[21:03:39] <Eviltwin> It needs to be done asynchronously
[21:05:07] <bananasontoast> Yay :-(
[21:06:09] <Eviltwin> bananasontoast: You need to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QjjRJ/
[21:06:33] <Eviltwin> And you use .isAvailable("...",function(isAvail){...})
[21:06:46] <Eviltwin> Instead of var isAvail = .isAvailable("..."); ...;
[21:07:08] <bananasontoast> Hmmm k I'll try that
[21:07:25] <dogarrhea2> ok i figured it out.
[21:07:35] <dogarrhea2> something to do with position absolute vs relative
[21:10:49] <siovene> Hello,.
[21:10:51] <tome> Hi all, does anyone out there use the metadata plugin? Is there a place to get the latest one? It appears to not be on the jquery plugins site, but I couldn't find that it was merged into jquery proper.
[21:11:01] <siovene> How can I write a selector for an html select which is not multiple?
[21:11:18] <Eviltwin> tome: What plugin?
[21:11:31] <siovene> I know I can do $("select[multiple]") for multiple select, but how can I select the single-select selects?
[21:11:38] <siovene> (wow that was a mouthful :))
[21:11:44] <dogarrhea2> hrm. somehow, my page is becoming more and more like .append("<div class='someclass'></div>")
[21:11:53] <Eviltwin> siovene: $("select:not([multiple])") perhaps?
[21:12:04] <siovene> Eviltwin: thanks, I'll try
[21:12:38] <siovene> Eviltwin: thanks, it worked :)
[21:12:40] <tome> Eviltwin: the Validate plugin keeps referring to the metadata plugin, and an old github exists of it here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-metadata   - but people in the forum (and pull request) indicate a newer version, which I cannot find anywhere, which makes me think it's either dead and removed or merged into jquery somehow.
[21:15:09] <Eviltwin> tome: Looks like it uses jQuery.data
[21:15:12] <Eviltwin> Which works fine
[21:15:41] <Eviltwin> Oh, wait
[21:15:50] <Eviltwin> $(element).metadata()[meta]
[21:15:51] <Eviltwin> Hmm
[21:16:32] <WerbDerver> Anyone have any ideas for a 1 semester senior college class (directed study) that involves front end dev work with html5, css3 and javascript?
[21:16:46] <WerbDerver> and by ideas I mean small projects
[21:17:01] <crab> werbderver: are you looking for a class that does that, or for ideas to teach in a class that... ah
[21:17:04] <tome> Eviltwin: yup, that's what I see (and also forum posts asking users to include that metadata before they can use metadata rules.) What's strange is the plugin is not on the query plugin site, though it's referenced there in a lot of places
[21:17:14] <Eviltwin> tome: Did you say jquery-metadata wasn't working?
[21:17:59] <crab> tome: i don't remember what it was for, but the last time i looked, i concluded that the metadata plugin was no longer needed because the core could do everything the plugin did
[21:18:05] <WerbDerver> not to teach, but for a directed study made by a senior student
[21:18:19] <WerbDerver> they arent offering enough electives for me to graduate so I need to make up my own class
[21:18:36] <Eviltwin> WerbDerver: Are you looking to get into things like <canvas>?
[21:18:38] <tome> crab: it appears to me the Validate plugin still relies on the metadata plugin, though there is no longer a 'home' for the metadata plugin
[21:18:55] <tome> Eviltwin: pull requests indicate that the git repo is out of date, and not maintained
[21:19:02] <crab> tome: does it use it a lot? maybe you could convert it to .data()?
[21:19:21] <Eviltwin> tome: Just because it hasn't been updated in a year doesn't mean it's "out of date"
[21:19:26] <Eviltwin> Or "not maintained"
[21:19:39] <Eviltwin> Could means they just didn't need to make any changes
[21:19:43] <Eviltwin> mean*
[21:19:57] <tome> Eviltwin: I calim out of date because there have been no replies to the reasonably worded pull requests, and even those point to a page (on jquery site) which no longer exists?
[21:20:01] <WerbDerver> Ya <canvas> and animation and transitions
[21:20:17] <WerbDerver> I really like html5readiness.com
[21:20:17] <tome> Eviltwin: but of course I'm here for the informed opinion : )
[21:24:31] <crab> what the validation plugin uses metadata for is quite horrid.
[21:24:52] <crab> class="{required:true,messages:{required:'required field'}}"
[21:25:18] <tome> crab: that is the only way unfortunately to specify a range on an element (rather than set it ahead of time in javascript) that I've found.
[21:25:48] <tome> crab: obviously that's a validation plugin limitation, so I agree with you, but unfortunately for me, I need the functionality
[21:28:41] <crab> tome: i see the jquery-validation git repository includes lib/jquery.metadata.js, i'd just try it with that one
[21:29:41] <igcewieling> http://pastebin.com/AvEfukNq  The alert triggers but $(this).val() is always empty
[21:33:04] <tome> crab: thanks! Yeah that's the old one (which has bugs, though the new one is also supposed to have bugs, etc.). Wish I had time right now to clean this up, because it seems like the Validate plugin is fairly important to jQuery from my (limited and noob) perspective, and to have it rely on that old metadata plugin which isn't even in the plugins page is suboptimal.
[21:33:39] <tome> thanks crab, Eviltwin. I appreciate your help.
[21:34:35] <b0ot> Eviltwin, this runs slow on my page: $.get('num.txt', function(data) { var theY = data; series.addPoint([x, theY], true, true); })
[21:34:50] <b0ot> I'm using jquery-ui to graph a number and it stutters alot
[21:35:11] <Eviltwin> And what is num.txt?
[21:37:23] <tome> crab:  on the plus side, with the plugin, everything works:)
[21:37:54] <crab> cool.
[21:38:47] <b0ot> Eviltwin, a file with one number in it
[21:38:52] <b0ot> 1-10
[21:39:09] <Eviltwin> I suspect series.addPoint is the culprit
[21:40:31] <dogarrhea2> when you append something, does jquery change the positioning style?
[21:42:18] <dogarrhea2> hrm apparently it does
[21:43:32] <crab> "the positioning style"?
[21:44:38] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Do you mean does it change the position attribute?
[21:44:39] <Eviltwin> No
[21:45:22] <crab> no, but the browser might decide to display whatever you're appending to differently because of its new contents
[21:46:16] <dogarrhea2> somehow the position attribute is getting changed..
[21:46:24] <dogarrhea2> i have a style that says "position:absolute"
[21:46:32] <dogarrhea2> but it becomes relative.
[21:47:12] <Eviltwin> So the style attribute says "relative" now?
[21:47:33] <dogarrhea2> the parent container is relative. the child is also relative
[21:47:40] <dogarrhea2> the css says "absolute"
[21:48:00] <Eviltwin> Then I guess it's not relative
[21:48:07] <dogarrhea2> and it's crossed out in the developer toolbar so i'm not sure where it's happening. rpobably some css precedence.  i just changed the style after i appended it back to aboslute
[21:50:26] <dogarrhea2> time to eat. good night
[21:51:05] <SudoKing> how could I create an array of the labels of all checked checkboxes in a form?
[21:51:10] <SudoKing> to my dismay, this did not work: var result = $(':checkbox:checked').map(function() { return $("label[for='" + this.id + "'"); }).get().join('|');
[21:51:33] <SudoKing> (minus the joining bit)
[21:53:11] <igcewieling> I have $('.format_tn').change(function() { alert('$(this).val()=' + $(this).val()); });  The alert triggers, but .val() is empty.  What might I be doing wrong?
[21:53:39] <Eviltwin> $(':checkbox:checked').map(function(){return $("label[for='" + this.id + "'").text()})
[21:53:42] <Eviltwin> For SudoKing
[21:53:49] <SudoKing> i'll try that, thanks :)
[21:54:01] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: What elements have the format_tn class?
[21:54:59] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: <span class="input format_tn"><input type="text" name="ani_match" autocomplete="off"></span>
[21:55:03] <SudoKing> hmm
[21:55:12] <SudoKing> Eviltwin: result = [object Object]
[21:55:19] <igcewieling> Now that you ask the question, I wonder if I should put the class on the input element?
[21:55:50] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: see ? alert
[21:55:51] <bot-t1> SudoKing, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[21:56:15] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: You need to call .val() on the input itself
[21:56:31] <Eviltwin> Perhaps $('.format_tn input').change(...) instead?
[21:56:35] <igcewieling> I realized that as I was pasting the example.
[21:57:05] <igcewieling> It is easy enough to move the class to the <input>
[21:57:40] <igcewieling> I was looking at the code, not the html and obviously not finding anything.  LOL!
[21:57:46] <SudoKing> where did that log to, cna't find it..]
[21:57:52] <igcewieling> Thanks, BTW.
[21:58:20] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: What browser are you using?
[21:58:32] <SudoKing> firefox, did see something in the web console
[21:58:47] <Eviltwin> The Firebug console
[21:58:51] <Eviltwin> Is where it should log to
[22:00:17] <xaxxon> how do I Find out if an event has a handler associated with it?  Basically if I get a mousedown for something with a click on it, I want to ignore it
[22:01:05] <SudoKing> i don't see the value of the checkbox in the message -- ({length:1, 0:{length:1, 0:"", prevObject:{length:1, prevObject: etc...
[22:01:07] <xaxxon> imagine a drag bar on top of a window, but a maximize button in the drag bar that if you click on, it shouldn't drag
[22:01:31] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: Oh, feed the result of the .map to $.makeArray
[22:01:35] <Eviltwin> And try logging that
[22:02:02] <Eviltwin> xaxxon: $("[selector for the button goes here]").click(false);
[22:02:07] <SudoKing> like this, correct?  console.log($.makeArray(result));
[22:02:36] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: Yup
[22:02:37] <xaxxon> evil: waht does that do?
[22:02:48] <Eviltwin> xaxxon: Do you know what event bubbling is?
[22:03:06] <xaxxon> oh, yes.  Now I understand
[22:03:20] <jkuery> hi guise i would need some help, I have this link on the index-page, <a href="#" class="add">Foobar</a>
[22:03:20] <Eviltwin> .click(false) is a shortcut for .click(function(){return false})
[22:03:27] <jkuery> it will trigger $(".add").click(function() {//sauce});
[22:03:36] <jkuery> but from my func.js i have this,  $('#results').append("<a href='javascript:;' class='add'>"+title+"</a>");
[22:03:50] <xaxxon> what I need is actually .mousedown(false).. but yes
[22:03:51] <SudoKing> Eviltwin: same output :(
[22:03:52] <heshanh> u need to use live
[22:03:57] <Eviltwin> heshanh: NO
[22:03:59] <jkuery> and those links dosnt trigger that click function like the first link does
[22:04:00] <Eviltwin> Do not use live
[22:04:11] <heshanh> why not
[22:04:14] <Eviltwin> jkuery: What version of jQuery
[22:04:28] <Eviltwin> heshanh: Because .on and .delegate are significantly better alternatives
[22:04:41] <heshanh> theres a .on?
[22:04:48] <Eviltwin> In jQuery 1.7+
[22:04:51] <heshanh> ahh
[22:05:05] <heshanh> i had no idea, what does that to diff to .live ?
[22:06:10] <Eviltwin> $("[selector]").live("click",function(){...}) accomplishes the same goal as $(document).delegate("[selector]","click",function(){...})
[22:06:30] <Eviltwin> However first it builds a jQuery object with everything that currently matches [selector]
[22:07:20] <Eviltwin> So say I have $("a").live("click",fnA).click(fnB);
[22:07:39] <heshanh> aha..
[22:07:43] <Eviltwin> I have an existing <a id="foo">
[22:07:53] <Eviltwin> And after I call that, I add <a id="bar">
[22:08:01] <Zxurian> http://jsfiddle.net/48YAv/ - is there a way to use setDate without having the datepicker popup?
[22:08:01] <Eviltwin> Clicking foo will trigger both fnA and fnB
[22:08:17] <Eviltwin> Clicking bar will trigger only fnA
[22:08:20] <xaxxon> Eviltwin, thank you.  That was a much better solution that what I was going to do
[22:08:21] <Eviltwin> Which is why it's misleading
[22:08:44] <Eviltwin> xaxxon: Good :P
[22:09:21] <heshanh> i see what you mean, but inst that an issue with selecting the the right elemen
[22:09:22] <heshanh> t
[22:09:34] <Eviltwin> What do you mean?
[22:10:20] <heshanh> if i only need bar why not a#bar ? rather than selecting all a tags. or am i getting it all wrong
[22:11:31] <heshanh> hang on a sec
[22:11:32] <heshanh> i got it
[22:13:25] <heshanh> http://www.timacheson.com/Blog/2011/oct/jquery_live_vs_delegate good article
[22:13:28] <Eviltwin> heshanh: Look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/ceYYC/
[22:13:57] <Eviltwin> Try clicking foo and bar
[22:15:32] <Eviltwin> jkuery: Did you figure out your problem?
[22:15:54] <xaxxon> Eviltwin, this is what I'm working on: http://ec2-50-18-91-62.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/desktop
[22:15:56] <heshanh> i see :), wll gues u learn something new everyday, thank  u very much
[22:16:13] <Eviltwin> heshanh: Also look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/WUzLu/
[22:16:28] <xaxxon> and now you can't drag if you start your click on one of the buttons
[22:16:34] <xaxxon> err.. wait
[22:16:49] <xaxxon> running old code
[22:17:32] <xaxxon> there it goes :)
[22:18:33] <Eviltwin> heshanh: You know how event bubbling works, right?
[22:18:42] <heshanh> yeah
[22:19:00] <Eviltwin> So the $("#blackbox").click(false) is preventing any clicks from inside the blackbox getting outside
[22:19:04] <heshanh> well i guess imma have to rewrite some of my code lol
[22:19:12] <Eviltwin> But I'm doing $("a").live("click",fnA)
[22:19:15] <heshanh> and link 1.7 crom the cdn
[22:19:23] <Eviltwin> So it looks like it's binding to the A's
[22:19:29] <Eviltwin> But it's actually binding to the document
[22:19:44] <Eviltwin> So unless the events are allowed to bubble up to the document, they don't hit .live's
[22:19:51] <Eviltwin> Which is why it's misleading
[22:20:09] <Eviltwin> So to sum up, it's a wasteful, misleading hack
[22:20:11] <Eviltwin> And should not be used
[22:20:42] <xaxxon> interesting
[22:20:55] <xaxxon> but that makes sense.  Constnatly scanning and binding to new elements would be prohibitive
[22:22:09] <Eviltwin> Extremely so
[22:22:14] <Eviltwin> Which is why it's not done that way
[22:22:49] <Eviltwin> .live was designed to look a lot like .bind
[22:23:01] <Eviltwin> To make things "easier"
[22:23:26] <Eviltwin> But as a result it's very confusing
[22:26:20] <coldhead> what's the gomfusion?
[22:29:09] <jkuery> Eviltwin i have version 1.6
[22:29:30] <Eviltwin> jkuery: see ? .delegate
[22:29:31] <bot-t1> jkuery, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:31:38] <Zxurian> http://jsfiddle.net/48YAv/1/ - not themed, but it gets the point. I can't find any combination of methods that allows me to preset the date within the input box without having the datepicker popup when the dialog is opened. any ideaS?
[22:34:30] <Eviltwin> Zxurian: You need to add datepicker under Add Resources
[22:34:49] <Eviltwin> Wait
[22:34:51] <Eviltwin> Nevermind
[22:34:53] <Eviltwin> It loaded finally
[22:35:25] <Zxurian> eviltwin: the styling isn't relevent to the problem that i'm having
[22:36:07] <Zxurian> i'm trying to set the date within the input, then open the dialog, without having the datepicker pre-opened when the dialog opens
[22:38:40] <Eviltwin> Does this work for you? http://jsfiddle.net/rbv56/
[22:41:05] <Zxurian> eviltwin: nope, it doesn't allow for subsequent changes
[22:41:05] <Zxurian> http://jsfiddle.net/rbv56/1/
[22:41:26] <jkuery>  http://pastebin.com/6EX1YEdy that is from my functions.js it prints out links when found items by search (some code are deleted as not importent) but these links would't trigger that click(function(){ from another *.js file but if i put same links what functions.js are appending to the #results div, they do work
[22:42:18] <jkuery> $(".add").click(function() {//Sauce});
[22:42:40] <jkuery> but if i put manually the links on the index-page they do work like a charm
[22:42:52] <Eviltwin> Try $(document).delegate(".add","click",function() {//Sauce}); instead?
[22:43:11] <Eviltwin> Zxurian: What's the expected behavior?
[22:44:10] <Zxurian> have a datepicker attached to an input within a dialog, and then be able to set the date on that input, then open the dialog, without the datepicker auto-open when the dialog is opened
[22:44:39] <jkuery> holy smoking god! You are awesome Eviltwin tysm
[22:45:43] <TSnowman> hi, I have something like $('<a>').addClass('remove').attr({href:'javascript:'}).appendTo(span), I'd like to call a function in this chain right after, how would I go about doing that?
[22:45:50] <Eviltwin> Zxurian: What about this: http://jsfiddle.net/rbv56/4/
[22:46:12] <Eviltwin> TSnowman: What kind fo function?
[22:46:24] <jkuery> Eviltwin btw i wonder how i can send variables with a link :S (sounds wierd?)
[22:46:35] <Eviltwin> What kind of variables?
[22:46:52] <jkuery> link some info, title, url, thumbnail
[22:46:59] <jkuery> that $(document).delegate(".add","click",function() {//Sauce}); will get
[22:47:02] <jkuery> from the links
[22:47:10] <TSnowman> Eviltwin: a simple function with no vars or closure that will allow me essentially to inline some commands that are relevant to that <a>
[22:47:39] <Eviltwin> So you want to run a function on that collection after all of that stuff is done?
[22:48:07] <TSnowman> technically, yes, a collection or just a single item
[22:48:25] <Eviltwin> myfunfunction($('<a>').addClass('remove').attr({href:'javascript:'}).appendTo(span));
[22:48:26] <TSnowman> later on I bind click event to .remove
[22:49:11] <Zxurian> eviltwin: don't think that's working quite right. if you click first button, then close dialog without the datepicker displayed, the dialog closes, then the datepicker shows up
[22:49:56] <Eviltwin> jkuery: http://jsfiddle.net/4m7kt/
[22:50:07] <TSnowman> Eviltwin: I'm not sure I understand that syntax...could I add arbitrary commands after .appendTo(span) to do what I want?
[22:50:26] <Eviltwin> TSnowman: I don't understand what you have and what you want to do
[22:50:32] <Eviltwin> Can you paste an example to pastebin or something
[22:50:42] <citizenkeys> how do i select the <ul style="display: none;"> immediately after the <a> in this: <li><a onclick="my_function">Click me</a><ul style="display: none;">
[22:50:43] <Eviltwin> Or jsFiddle
[22:51:08] <Eviltwin> citizenkeys: Try $("a + ul")
[22:51:15] <citizenkeys> i'm trying to select the <ul> using $(this).next("ul").css("display")) but that doesn't work.
[22:51:34] <Eviltwin> Well what is this? The <A> you clicked?
[22:52:01] <citizenkeys> i need the click the <a> and get the display property of that immediately following <ul>
[22:52:40] <Eviltwin> Do you have something like $("a").click(function(){$(this).next("ul").css("display")})?
[22:53:28] <citizenkeys> like i said, i've already tried $(this).next("ul").css("display")) and it doesn't work.
[22:53:29] <jkuery> Eviltwin in ur exemple, then i would like to get out the data-foo from the links
[22:53:42] <Eviltwin> jkuery: What browser are you using?
[22:53:50] <Eviltwin> citizenkeys: Can you paste your code at jsFiddle or pastebin?
[22:54:03] <Eviltwin> citizenkeys: I need to see how the function is getting called
[22:54:17] <jkuery> Eviltwin firefox
[22:54:25] <Eviltwin> Zxurian: I think you have access to the dialog's close event
[22:54:39] <Eviltwin> In that case you can call .datepicker("hide") when they're closing
[22:54:44] <Eviltwin> jkuery: Do you have Firebug?
[22:54:55] <jkuery> yes good idea
[22:54:57] <Zxurian> tried that, still doesn't have the same effect, also tried disable, setdate, enable, and it still shows up
[22:55:07] <Eviltwin> jkuery: console.log sends the data to the Firebug window
[22:55:31] <jkuery> oh well i just chaanged console.log into alert($(this).data());
[22:55:39] <Eviltwin> ...
[22:55:42] <Eviltwin> jkuery: see ? alert
[22:55:43] <bot-t1> jkuery, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[22:55:56] <jkuery> Didnt know
[22:56:13] <Eviltwin> Well you can also see what .data("foo") and .data("bar") do
[22:56:33] <citizenkeys> n/m.  i'll just give that <ul> an id.  solve that problem real quick.
[22:57:07] <jkuery> Oh now i see
[22:57:55] <Zxurian> http://jsfiddle.net/rbv56/5/ - you can see that with click, it doesn't really work properly, as it flashes once before closing, however with click2, it doesn't respect the "hide" method at all when called before the dialog("open")
[22:58:47] <jkuery> Got it all is wokring now tysm again Eviltwin
[23:01:19] <SudoKing> http://pastebin.com/pC5CNbBS whenever i run this, in every case, it POSTs but there is no data whatsoever passed (looked at it through tamper data)
[23:01:51] <Kuni> I am experiencing with menus and want to produce the following: when hovering over li, submenu is shown; on leaving the li the submenu is faded out; when hovering over an entry in the fading out submenu in time, the animation should be stopped and reversed
[23:02:15] <SudoKing> why isn't this data being passed: target => 'test'
[23:03:06] <Kuni> now I don't manage to stop the animation and reversing it: just stop() leaves the item partially faded out and show() or fadeIn(0) do not work; fadeIn(0) on its own works, but the previous animation is completed first, which looks bad
[23:04:21] <Kuni> using only show() achieves nothing at all, it seems to be different from fadeIn(0) somehow
[23:06:00] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: You know about same origin policy, right?
[23:06:40] <Eviltwin> Kuni: Try .fadeTo
[23:06:44] <Eviltwin> ?.fadeTo @ Kuni
[23:06:44] <bot-t1> Kuni, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[23:07:34] <Eviltwin> And you'll probably want .stop(true)
[23:07:56] <SudoKing> so there's no way to post data to a remote server?
[23:09:28] <SudoKing> hmph. time to start from the beginning xd
[23:09:42] <Zxurian> Eviltwin: in case it's a lingering issue, only way I was able to achieve it was to create the datepicker as part of the dialog open, and destroy it as part of the dialog close each time
[23:09:44] <Kuni> EvilTwin; ah, thanks, that's better - added both
[23:11:37] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: It'd be kind of a HUGE security risk if it were possible
[23:14:29] <enerel> hi guys i build custom slide tooltip but not working why?
[23:14:34] <enerel> http://pastie.org/2931848
[23:15:31] <Eviltwin> enerel: I think you want opacity: 0 and opacity: 1
[23:15:39] <Eviltwin> Instead of opacity: 'show' and opacity: 'hide'
[23:16:30] <Kuni> Eviltwin: just for understanding, can yoou tell me the difference between fadeIn and fadeTo (with opacity set to 1)?
[23:17:34] <Eviltwin> fadeIn assumes that if the opacity is not 0, it's already faded in to the appropriate level
[23:17:59] <Kuni> ah, thanks, that explains it
[23:18:06] <Eviltwin> Kuni: You can also do some cool stuff like this: http://jsfiddle.net/BYD92/
[23:18:13] <enerel> opacity: 0 or 1 does not work
[23:18:27] <enerel> opacity: "show" works
[23:19:01] <Eviltwin> So...it's working?
[23:19:49] <enerel> no
[23:20:11] <Eviltwin> Can you put this in a jsFiddle instead?
[23:20:14] <Eviltwin> ?jsFiddle @ enerel
[23:20:15] <bot-t1> enerel, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[23:20:57] <Kuni> Eviltwin: did you just made that fiddle or did you actually have that lying around as example; came rather quick
[23:21:12] <Eviltwin> Kuni: I spend about 3-5 minutes making it
[23:21:16] <Eviltwin> spent*
[23:21:25] <Kuni> oh, it seemed quicker than that
[23:21:35] <Eviltwin> I was working on it before you asked your question
[23:21:47] <Kuni> nice coincidence :)
[23:22:23] <enerel> http://jsfiddle.net/utxsZ/
[23:23:03] <Kuni> so the fadout in your example kicks fro the mouseleave kicks in after the delay - not necessarily what one expects
[23:23:54] <Eviltwin> Kuni: So you can get lots of different, interesting behaviors depending on where you put things
[23:23:58] <Eviltwin> Like here I moved the delay: http://jsfiddle.net/BYD92/1/
[23:24:14] <Eviltwin> In the first example, it made sure the div was shown for at least a second
[23:24:32] <Eviltwin> So if you hovered your mouse for a second then moved away, it faded out instantly
[23:24:38] <enerel> i want this effect http://ini.mn/service.php
[23:25:07] <enerel> i did myself above tooltip actually.
[23:25:20] <Eviltwin> In the second version, it now stays open a second after you have moved the mouse out
[23:25:24] <enerel> like 3years ago
[23:25:31] <Eviltwin> But still will immediately fade back in if you move back over
[23:26:05] <enerel> yes
[23:28:07] <Eviltwin> enerel: http://jsfiddle.net/utxsZ/2/
[23:28:35] <Kuni> Eviltwin: had a bit of trouble understanding why the latter happens, but it is because of stop(true) (right?)
[23:29:34] <Eviltwin> Yes, so every animation gets added to the animation queue
[23:29:37] <Kuni> it's sorta cool, anyway, though you really have to careful where placing these things
[23:29:41] <Eviltwin> Because of the queue
[23:29:52] <Eviltwin> You animations happen one after another
[23:29:52] <enerel> Eviltwin: http://www.mongolianairlines.com/test/ see bottom carousel tooltip.
[23:30:11] <Eviltwin> Your*
[23:30:21] <Eviltwin> fadeTo and delay are technically animations
[23:30:38] <Eviltwin> .stop(true) empties the animation queue and stops the current animation
[23:30:55] <Eviltwin> enerel: http://jsfiddle.net/utxsZ/3/
[23:31:02] <Eviltwin> The display property was part of your problem
[23:31:56] <Eviltwin> Kuni: Anyway, jQuery makes animations really easy and they're fun to play with
[23:32:21] <murosai> can i use post and also pass additional parameters in the url?
[23:32:31] <enerel> Eviltwin: tnx
[23:32:36] <Eviltwin> murosai: Sure
[23:32:37] <Kuni> fadeTo(0,x) sets opacity directly, according to doc, would that also fall under animation?
[23:32:55] <Eviltwin> Kuni: It fades to the specified opacity
[23:33:09] <amh345> is there a way to disable more than one click on a toggle?   if i rapidly toggle a div by clicking like an idiot-- the toggle starts getting weird.
[23:33:16] <Eviltwin> And .fadeTo is an animation
[23:34:04] <Kuni> yes, but with duration 0 it states that opacity is set directly: just wondering if that is a separate case or is still queued
[23:34:32] <Eviltwin> Not sure if it's still queued, but if it is, it still happens almost instantly
[23:34:54] <Eviltwin> amh345: Can we see an example of your problem? (preferably in jsFiddle)
[23:36:14] <amh345> ok, ill paste it to jsfiddle.   i just did $('#click_me').unbind('click').next() on the first toggle.  but i can't get it to rebind again with $('#click_me').bind('click').next()
[23:36:45] <Eviltwin> amh345: see ? .bind
[23:36:48] <bot-t1> amh345, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[23:37:45] <amh345> i would .bind on the callback of the initial toggle, right?
[23:37:58] <Kuni> Eviltwin: thanks for the help, that was very pleasant. But I am off to work now.
[23:38:06] <Eviltwin> Kuni: You're welcome
[23:38:08] <flu1> hey all! im new to jqueryâ€¦i need to find the position from an element; the absolut position to the whole documentâ€¦so that position that i see from top left from the browserâ€¦tried it with different methots like, offset(), scrollTop(), position() (like $('#test').offset()) etc & i always get 0 as return value? anyone knows where the prob could be??
[23:38:44] <Cork> flu1: is the element inline?
[23:38:51] <flu1> yes
[23:38:57] <Cork> then it doesn't have a position
[23:38:59] <Cork> dom doens
[23:39:04] <Cork> *'t provide it
[23:40:00] <Eviltwin> amh345: Is there a reason you don't simply do this? http://jsfiddle.net/PBGZZ/
[23:41:11] <Eviltwin> Cork: Really? I'm pretty sure everything still has a offset
[23:41:20] <Eviltwin> In fact I use that for some code I wrote
[23:41:45] <Cork> Eviltwin: inline elements isn't positioned, it follows the text flow
[23:42:00] <Cork> it can even be wrapped (cut up into parts)
[23:42:20] <Cork> so it can't have a position
[23:43:00] <Eviltwin> Cork: What do you get? http://jsfiddle.net/Zs2nA/
[23:43:04] <Eviltwin> In the console
[23:44:55] <Eviltwin> flu1: Can you make a jsFiddle example? Or link us a pastebin of your ode?
[23:44:56] <Eviltwin> code*
[23:45:52] <Eviltwin> Cork: Look at the examples: http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[23:45:56] <Eviltwin> A lot of them involve text
[23:46:01] <Cork> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/Zs2nA/
[23:46:41] <Eviltwin> That's what I linked you
[23:46:44] <Cork> there is no way to give a meaningfull value for itx x y
[23:46:49] <Cork> opps
[23:46:54] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Cp2uK/
[23:47:02] <Cork> my c&p messes up... >_>
[23:47:14] <Eviltwin> It's for the bounding box
[23:49:05] <Eviltwin> But I see your point
[23:49:31] <Cork> as soon as a inline element wrapps your the position is 0,0
[23:49:37] <Cork> -your
[23:50:21] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/jYWdb/
[23:50:33] <flu1> yepâ€¦. i got the solution, i get the pos of the parent dic & calculate the new posâ€¦that works thx for help

[23:53:58] <_nix00> hi,all. I need some documents about how to build jquery-ui from source code.
[23:54:08] <Eviltwin> _nix00: How to "build" it?
[23:54:42] <Cork> _nix00: its just a bunch of files thats combined and minimized
[23:54:55] <Cork> _nix00: its not something you "build"
[23:55:28] <_nix00> Eviltwin: use google-compiler to complier it .
[23:56:04] <Eviltwin> No thanks, I'm good
[23:57:15] <_nix00> Eviltwin: Sorry. I mean, "build" is  use google-compiler to complier it.in my mind
[23:59:16] <Eviltwin> _nix00: You probably want to use this: http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_app.html
