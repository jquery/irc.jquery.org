[00:00:01] <Cork> fructose: if you want name= ['field1-name', 'field2-name'...], value=['val1','val2',...]] kina structure
[00:00:05] <Cork> fructose: else no
[00:00:06] <andrewjackson> MS seems to like to think they make the standards
[00:00:19] <Cork> you want { name:value, name:value}
[00:00:37] <andrewjackson> then again, what did someone say here? they earned it? ;)
[00:00:39] <Cork> the array is [{name:'', value:''}, {name:'', value:''}, {name:'', value:''}]
[00:01:11] <Eviltwin> MS has brought some ideas to the browser that had previously not existed
[00:01:19] <Eviltwin> But they almost universally got them wrong
[00:01:22] <ColKurtz> lol
[00:01:36] <Eviltwin> Like the idea of selecting / filtering
[00:01:40] <andrewjackson> well, MS is pretty good for not getting things right the first time
[00:01:41] <fructose> Oh, I guess I want a property map
[00:01:51] <Eviltwin> Started with MS's idea to put bigass lists as properties in the Doccument
[00:01:57] <Eviltwin> Document*
[00:02:05] <andrewjackson> Vista should have ben Win7
[00:02:07] <Eviltwin> Let you do very basic lookups by tag name
[00:02:13] <Cork> fructose: uh.. the js name for that is an object
[00:02:14] <andrewjackson> they had a Win98 second edition lol
[00:02:16] <Eviltwin> And be relatively fast
[00:02:25] <Eviltwin> Then they decided to do document.all
[00:02:31] <Eviltwin> Which is a list of every element in the document
[00:02:42] <Eviltwin> Because people wanted to filter by other things
[00:02:59] <Eviltwin> And they decided to just screw it and have them do the filtering in JavaScript
[00:03:13] <Whirl3d> anybody remember MS Bob?
[00:03:43] <andrewjackson> I've been using jQuery too long
[00:03:56] <meghdad> Whirl3d, i havent used it, but i think the idea was great
[00:03:59] <andrewjackson> starting to lose touch with Javascript
[00:04:29] <meghdad> that computing must be integrated into daily life, not a separate intrument and device
[00:04:32] <Whirl3d> meghdad, you know of course that Bob was 100% designed to make users hate the MacOS, right?
[00:04:34] <andrewjackson> thought document.all was netscape, then I remembered if (typeof document.all === 'undefined') was how to check if it wasn't IE
[00:04:37] <JKarsrud> andrewjackson: nope, not really, you're just getting too used to the abstractions
[00:04:57] <fructose> Maybe I could just cheat and do $.get(url + '&' + form.serialize(), { op: 'foo', id: bar })?
[00:04:57] <Whirl3d> Bob was punitive.
[00:04:58] <meghdad> Whirl3d, no, i am barely familiar with that era
[00:05:11] <Eviltwin> "document.all was introduced in Internet Explorer 4"
[00:05:14] <NihilistDandy> andrewjackson: I will take a nice abstraction over boilerplate any day of the week
[00:05:26] <Cork> andrewjackson: except that failed fas as netscape implemented it for compatibility
[00:05:34] <Cork> fas==fast
[00:05:41] <andrewjackson> JKarsrud: you're right... gonna need to do a project without jQuery as an excersise
[00:05:47] <Whirl3d> Apple came out with the smiling computer and the GUI when windows was still in WFW311 (Windows for Workgroups)
[00:05:50] <Cork> it didn't really do anything, but it wasn't undefined
[00:06:07] <andrewjackson> *exercise
[00:06:16] <Whirl3d> So, MS scrambled to create a "fake" os that had consequences that were startling if you wanted to run a graphical user interface...
[00:06:20] <JKarsrud> andrewjackson: if you start using node.js, it'll come back to you, and then you see how much stuff in JS isn't related to `document`
[00:06:36] <Whirl3d> make a mistake and a dragon burns the contents of your screen, for example.
[00:06:50] <andrewjackson> JKarsrud: oh... I LIKE node.js, but haven't played with it much
[00:07:24] <JKarsrud> but doing something without jQuery in the browser is nice too of course. But if you think about it, you probably do a lot of stuff that isn't jQuery
[00:07:26] <Whirl3d> It basically said, if you want a childish OS, this is what it's like. That gave them enough time to get Windows 95 to market.
[00:07:27] * meghdad gets back to js work
[00:07:29] <Eviltwin> node.js is still one of those things that frightens me
[00:07:40] <JKarsrud> why?
[00:07:43] <andrewjackson> am wanting to get a dedicated server with node.js
[00:07:53] <JKarsrud> andrewjackson: nodejitsu?
[00:07:54] <Eviltwin> JavaScript isn't CPU- or memory-efficient
[00:08:02] <Eviltwin> It's fine in the browser
[00:08:08] <Eviltwin> When all it's doing is handling a few user interactions
[00:08:11] <Eviltwin> And only for one person
[00:08:17] <Eviltwin> But when it's on a server
[00:08:24] <astropirate> Eviltwin: its not meant for heavy duty work. Its meant to move small amounts of data fast
[00:08:28] <Eviltwin> Handling potentially hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of clients
[00:08:32] <Eviltwin> Doesn't scale well
[00:08:36] <andrewjackson> well, I have my own servers, but they're neglected for the time being lol
[00:09:12] <NihilistDandy> I've been utterly unable to get into node. The hype just turned me off
[00:09:25] <Eviltwin> It's definitely something I want to poke at at some point
[00:09:27] <astropirate> Eviltwin: i've done a rudimentary benchmark and for what its meant to do, it does it gloriously.
[00:09:28] <JKarsrud> well, it's an evented language, and it has v8 (which is effin' powerful) to control it, and uses c and c++ as well, so I think it's fairly mature already
[00:09:31] <Eviltwin> Just don't think I'll ever use it for anything real
[00:09:40] <Eviltwin> astropirate: What is that? Handle <5 requests at a time?
[00:09:47] <fructose> woo hoo. cheating works
[00:10:17] <JKarsrud> Eviltwin: I think it says something when Linkedin, a site with quite some amount of traffic uses node; http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/16/linkedin-node/
[00:10:23] <astropirate> Eviltwin: yes.
[00:10:57] <Nomikos> Node.js benchmarks http://zgadzaj.com/benchmarking-nodejs-basic-performance-tests-against-apache-php
[00:11:32] <andrewjackson> Eviltwin: but doesn't it compile to machine code? also there's no document, window, or browser type things...
[00:12:00] <NihilistDandy> I'm so sick of benchmarks
[00:12:06] <Nomikos> :-)
[00:12:09] <JKarsrud> anyways, I am doing an application in node now, and it's a dream to work with, and that's what matters to me
[00:12:11] <NihilistDandy> I'm going to just shatter every bench on the planet with a bat
[00:12:12] <JKarsrud> I know javascript
[00:12:24] <JKarsrud> I can share modules with the browser
[00:12:29] <Nomikos> "doesn't scale well" is also highly overrated ..
[00:12:38] <Eviltwin> So it can serve 18 bytes?
[00:12:40] <JKarsrud> that makes it the perfect choice for me
[00:12:54] <Nomikos> Java is "slow" but that's not stopping it from running everywhere, even servers
[00:13:10] <astropirate> Nomikos: Eviltwin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e1zzna-dNw
[00:13:10] <NihilistDandy> Nomikos: BUT IS IT WEBSCALE
[00:14:05] <andrewjackson> JKarsrud: I agree, I was dumbfounded when I simply tried a few node examples
[00:14:22] <andrewjackson> so MUCH more you can do with it, than with just Apache and PHP
[00:14:48] <JKarsrud> well, not really, but it makes some stuff easier
[00:14:53] <JKarsrud> :)
[00:15:39] <NihilistDandy> Much as I like all these JS abstractions, sometimes I wish the documentation weren't so spotty. All these pretty animations and callbacks, but hardly a manual in sight :D
[00:15:44] <andrewjackson> but you have control over the clients and headers being sent
[00:16:00] <Eviltwin> I don't really consider these benchmarks worth anything: http://zgadzaj.com/benchmarking-nodejs-basic-performance-tests-against-apache-php
[00:16:00] <JKarsrud> but I had no intention of making this channel into a node.js bashing channel right now.... I'll discuss this with some like-minded folk at #node.js and #nodejitsu :P
[00:16:27] <Eviltwin> I'm sure nginx would kick both of their asses by a long shot serving that file staticly
[00:16:46] <Nomikos> Well yes, for static content nginx is king, obviously
[00:16:49] <Eviltwin> I'd like to see some benchmarks where there's database access or something else involved
[00:16:58] <Eviltwin> Because what they have here is something that could easily be static
[00:17:11] <NihilistDandy> JKarsrud: I don't mean to sound like I'm bashing. I have nearly zero experience with node. The only thing that ever bothered me was the near messianic hype :D
[00:17:35] <Nomikos> NihilistDandy: stick around another 10 years, you get used to it :p
[00:17:44] <NihilistDandy> Nomikos: lol
[00:17:58] <Nomikos> Java, XML, WebObjects, OOP, ...
[00:18:05] <meghdad> where does console.log write its msg to
[00:18:06] <meghdad> ?
[00:18:14] <imc> to the console
[00:18:19] <Eviltwin> ?alert @ meghdad
[00:18:19] <bot-t> meghdad, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[00:18:30] <Nomikos> meghdad: what browser are you using?
[00:18:36] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ meghdad
[00:18:36] <bot-t> meghdad, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[00:18:39] <imc> personally I use chromium for debugging
[00:18:50] <imc> (but firefox/vimperator for everything else)
[00:19:07] <andrewjackson> developer tools :P
[00:19:25] <imc> chromium's 1-proc-1-tab is great when you mistakely write an infinite loop or something in the sort
[00:19:37] <imc> (with firefox, you must kill it all)
[00:19:39] <jon_x> would this be a jquery bug or a browser bug?  http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/Wx6kw/
[00:19:42] <meghdad> Nomikos, i have firebug, but it isnt written to the console
[00:19:55] <jon_x> with the extra markup ... data-itemprop="RemoveUrl UnsafeUrl"
[00:19:57] <imc> meghdad: errors before that point?
[00:20:06] <jon_x> jquery can't stop the link click in firefox
[00:20:23] <meghdad> no error in the console, maybe a goof somewhere, let me check
[00:20:37] <NihilistDandy> imc: Firefox has always made me want to kill all
[00:20:44] <NihilistDandy> :D
[00:20:49] <imc> ghgh
[00:20:49] <meghdad> ok , working
[00:21:10] <imc> NihilistDandy: well, when you can point me to the equivalent of vimperator for chromium, I will throw firefox away
[00:21:14] <imc> :(
[00:21:34] <meghdad> and it is undefined, now i understand where did the error undefined come from :>
[00:21:45] <Nomikos> IMHO Firefox is the worst browser out there (except for all the others) (well, maybe Chrome not)
[00:22:28] <meghdad> Nomikos, basically u pasre the web urself?
[00:22:45] <Nomikos> meghdad: I wish I could. I hate Firefox, but I'm stuck with using it because I hate the others /more/
[00:23:02] <imc> ok guys, I'm trying something nasty with Liftweb (based on jQuery). It uses a jQuery.ajax() wrapper, but It basically works just the same
[00:23:15] <Whirl3d> I miss flock
[00:23:16] <NihilistDandy> imc: vichrome seems well-reviewed, but it lacks yank, which would likely be a dealbreaker for most people
[00:23:16] <meghdad> i have to use ff too, but i have opera as well and prefer it when i dont have to use ff
[00:23:25] <imc> NihilistDandy: indeed
[00:23:36] <Eviltwin> I'm definitely a WebKit person
[00:23:47] <Nomikos> Hmm.. haven't tried Opera in a long time..
[00:23:50] <NihilistDandy> WebKit 4 lyfe
[00:24:04] <imc> what I'm trying to do is to define something in the like: function (onSuccess) { ....ajax(data, onSuccess, null, "javascript"); }
[00:24:22] <meghdad> Nomikos, definitely improved, ff is just hype now
[00:24:44] <andrewjackson> meh... imo Chrome > IE > Firefox > Sarfari
[00:24:47] * Nomikos makes a mental note to try it sometime
[00:24:48] <andrewjackson> just on principle
[00:25:11] <NihilistDandy> The whole Opera experience just never sat well with me. It felt like they were trying to do too much. They've definitely made a fine browser, but it never clicked with me
[00:25:11] <meghdad> what engine opera uses?
[00:25:26] <andrewjackson> same here
[00:25:31] <NihilistDandy> meghdad: Presto
[00:25:32] <imc> what i do not understand is : 1) the response of this ajax call is in a scope where "onSuccess" is available? and 2) if not, how can "onSuccess" be used ?
[00:25:34] <meghdad> andrewjackson, pretty much agreed, but i mainly use ie9 on Windows
[00:25:36] <andrewjackson> spagehtti or something? lol
[00:25:37] <NihilistDandy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_(layout_engine)
[00:25:49] <andrewjackson> oh, presto that's it
[00:26:02] <imc> 'cause right now I'm trying to just "return onSuccess(some_value);" in the ajax response
[00:26:04] <meghdad> nice word, has a nice ring into it
[00:26:07] <meghdad> like bingo
[00:26:10] <meghdad> :D
[00:26:21] <andrewjackson> I always think noodles for some reason hahaha
[00:26:23] <imc> but I suspect that's wrong (maybe 'return' ? or 'onSuccess' not in scope? or both?)
[00:26:34] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ imc
[00:26:34] <bot-t> imc, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[00:26:40] <NihilistDandy> andrewjackson: Safari's my favorite browser, really, but it's a joke anywhere but on a Mac
[00:26:56] <Nomikos> imc: try the console.log thing, see what does and doesn't work
[00:27:05] <imc> Nomikos: right
[00:27:05] <NihilistDandy> Chrome if I have my druthers on *NIX/Win, FF if I have to settle for the fat sister
[00:27:34] <andrewjackson> Apple software on Windows is usually not very good, same for Microsoft software on Mac
[00:28:20] <NihilistDandy> imc: http://vimium.github.com/
[00:28:32] <andrewjackson> jsut what I hear, but tbh... I don't really fool around with Apple products
[00:28:40] <NihilistDandy> andrewjackson: Truth. And they're both awful about bundling a bunch of bloat with every damn thing
[00:28:58] <andrewjackson> like HP with their adware lol
[00:29:08] <imc> NihilistDandy: clearly not enough for me :)
[00:29:33] <NihilistDandy> imc: What more could you need? :D
[00:29:50] <NihilistDandy> CUSTOMIZATION == QUALITY
[00:29:52] <NihilistDandy> ~
[00:30:09] <imc> NihilistDandy: macros, for instance
[00:30:13] <imc> just a start
[00:30:20] <meghdad> there's this line  this.$input_picker = this.$element.find('input.oe_datepicker_container');
[00:30:48] <meghdad> and the context that it is written in, has extended the widget object
[00:31:07] <meghdad> oh nvm
[00:31:12] <meghdad> i think i got it
[00:31:29] <NihilistDandy> imc: I dunno. I'm an emacs user, so I don't know what matters in vimland :D
[00:31:38] * Nomikos gets out of the way
[00:31:49] <imc> NihilistDandy: macros are macros
[00:31:55] <imc> you record something and you can replay it
[00:32:02] <imc> very very very cool in browsers
[00:32:03] <NihilistDandy> I know that :P
[00:32:18] <NihilistDandy> I've just never used vim except to edit my .emacs :D
[00:32:23] <imc> of course, you need to have some keyboard power for that
[00:32:33] <NihilistDandy> Meta-Fu
[00:32:55] <imc> i.e. macros on vimium would be useless without the other tons of useful commands found in vimperator
[00:34:15] * NihilistDandy nods
[00:45:06] <Whirl3d> xbmcbuntu or death!
[00:49:11] * Whirl3d slaps head...wrong channel.. time to sleep
[00:49:38] <Whirl3d> gnite all. Eviltwin, thanks again for the interesting info. Talk to you later...
[01:48:43] <cwillu_at_work> is there any better way to make a $.ajax request pass parameters via a query string than doing silly things with string munging + $.param?
[01:48:56] <cwillu_at_work> (in the case of methods other than GET; in this particular case, the DELETE method)
[01:55:31] <mindis|wurk> hello chaps. anyone got experience with .on() not working with dynamically loaded content? i'm using .load to get some content on my page but the .on() i've set on the page doesn't work with them even though i have nearly identical elements on the page that do work
[01:56:36] <Advocated> If I have various elements that are numbered, such as: testA 1, testB 2, testC 3, testD 4, testE 5, i'm looking for a way to be able to change say testD from 4 to priority 1, but i'd want all the other priorities to follow suit, so 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3 and so on. Any ideas please? all values are in list menus
[01:58:16] <cwillu_at_work> mindis|wurk, are you using the $(containing_element).on('click', '.actual_element', function () {alert('look ma!')};); form?
[01:58:17] <cwillu_at_work> (where containing_element is something that is not dynamically added
[01:58:17] <mindis|wurk> yep
[02:00:31] <merlin1978> how to get the tab name of  the jquery ui tab using the index?
[02:02:45] <ShawnRisk> Would this work or am I doing this wrong: "title": <a href="community/" . $.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").text()) ">" . $.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").text()) . "</a>",  Any ideas?
[02:03:12] <Nomikos> is table a defined variable?
[02:03:52] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance JavaScript/Node dev?
[02:04:30] <meghdad> where in the doc does it explain $ syntax?
[02:05:07] <ShawnRisk> Nomikos: yes var table = obj.next(),
[02:06:08] <Nomikos> ShawnRisk: is your code a copy/paste, or pseudocode? because it's probably not running like that
[02:06:28] <ShawnRisk> Nomikos: not running like?
[02:07:03] <Nomikos> "title": <a href="community/" . $.trim   -- is this javascript, or php, or ..?
[02:07:14] <ShawnRisk> jQuery
[02:07:31] <Nomikos> shouldn't the <a> tag be quoted?
[02:07:56] <Nomikos> what is the . between community/" and $.trim
[02:08:27] <klawd_prime> hi!
[02:08:35] <klawd_prime> is there a way to make $.get not follow redirects?
[02:08:41] <shwaiil> hi
[02:09:13] <Advocated> If I have various elements that are numbered, such as: testA 1, testB 2, testC 3, testD 4, testE 5, i'm looking for a way to be able to change say testD from 4 to priority 1, but i'd want all the other priorities to follow suit, so 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3 and so on. Any ideas please? all values are in list menus
[02:09:16] <Nomikos> mehrdad: a good starting point is http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[02:09:28] <ShawnRisk> Nomikos: var obj = $(this), and .featuredlistname is a css class.
[02:10:32] <Nomikos> ShawnRisk: is it working?
[02:10:46] <mehrdad> Nomikos, read that before, it doesn't explain $ though
[02:10:59] <mehrdad> just uses it in all examples
[02:11:04] <Nomikos> mehrdad: $ is just the variable name, it's not syntax
[02:11:32] <Eviltwin> $ is a function
[02:11:33] <ShawnRisk> Nomikos: haven't tested
[02:11:34] <mehrdad> what variable, how is it assigned
[02:11:40] <Nomikos> mehrdad: they also use 'jquery' as name to not clash with other JS frameworks
[02:11:41] <Eviltwin> Just like alert or prompt etc
[02:11:52] <mehrdad> coming from a c# background this stinks to me
[02:12:10] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: ok, a variable containing a function :-p
[02:12:37] <Nomikos> mehrdad: in JS the $ character is perfectly valid for variable/function names
[02:13:04] <mehrdad> ok i understand that ^
[02:13:32] <mehrdad> but u say it is a pointer to a function?
[02:14:15] <Nomikos> I don't think JS has pointers. It's the name of a function?
[02:14:47] <mehrdad> a variable name containing a function? :/
[02:15:53] <mehrdad> Eviltwin, what function is it in this context? $element   is element a function?
[02:16:06] <Cork> Nomikos: javascript doesn't have pointers, but it has references
[02:16:17] <Nomikos> well.. yes. JS functions are first class objects, like strings, numbers, .. So you can do var x = function() {};
[02:16:24] <Nomikos> and then run x()
[02:16:31] <mehrdad> well ref pointer whatever
[02:16:43] <Cork> opps wrong order of conversation i see ;P
[02:17:18] <mehrdad> i meant pointer in general sense
[02:17:25] <mehrdad> whatever though
[02:17:32] <Nomikos> or, you can do var $ = function () {}; or function $() {}
[02:17:40] <mehrdad> so is $element calling a function named element
[02:17:41] <mehrdad> ?
[02:17:48] <Nomikos> no, $ is not syntax
[02:18:07] <Cork> mehrdad: $element is calling a function called "$element"
[02:18:09] <Nomikos> just treat '$' as alphanumeric here
[02:18:16] <Cork> $ is a function name just like any other
[02:18:33] <Nomikos> for JS '$' is the same as 'x' or 'H'
[02:19:07] <mehrdad> so why some funcs dont use it? here e.g this.$element.find  . find is a function with no $
[02:19:17] <Nomikos> jQuery decided to use it for /their/ stuff, since it looks neat and is short and you won't confuse it with your own variables, usually
[02:19:52] <mehrdad> ok so it is an internal usage for jquery base code?
[02:19:55] <Nomikos> .find() is a method of the jQuery object, chained like in Java
[02:20:34] <Nomikos> you can chain methods, $('.class').next().find()
[02:20:49] <mehrdad> methods against functions like in VB?
[02:20:58] <Nomikos> I have no idea how VB works
[02:21:10] <Nomikos> (nor Java for that matter, but I know it has method chaining)
[02:21:22] <Cork> mehrdad: its basically that the function returns the class it belongs to
[02:21:38] <Cork> mehrdad: so basically function find(...) { ... return $; }
[02:21:55] <Cork> kinda, (extreamly simplified)
[02:21:59] <Nomikos> That's how it's implemented, yeah
[02:22:07] <Nomikos> (sorta, I guess :-p)
[02:22:14] <Cork> not at all actually
[02:22:21] <Cork> but for this subject, ya
[02:23:49] <mehrdad> it is a mess to me
[02:24:06] <mehrdad> maybe my brain is malfunctioning or that i am distracted somehow
[02:24:09] <mehrdad> brb
[02:24:15] <Nomikos> It can take a while to click
[02:24:20] <Nomikos> I know it did for me...
[02:24:21] <Cork> mehrdad: the objects members returns the object theyr members of
[02:24:33] <Cork> mehrdad: that means you can chain all the members after eachother
[02:24:43] <Nomikos> knowing JavaScript and CSS and the basics of OOP helps a lot
[02:24:44] <Cork> as they all return the object again
[02:24:49] <Cork> ya
[02:25:11] <mehrdad> Cork, what u are saying is basically like a design pattern in java and c#
[02:25:15] <mehrdad> cant remember the name
[02:25:21] <Cork> mehrdad: kinda
[02:25:35] <Cork> mehrdad: its a bit different, but ya, much of the idea is the same
[02:25:37] <mehrdad> but we could write methods that returns the their own class object
[02:25:42] <mehrdad> so it was recursive
[02:25:43] <Nomikos> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining
[02:25:48] <Cork> yes
[02:26:24] <OverL> Hi, i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/y6X3r/ and i have problem, when i call this function first time (example with button) so jQuery send one request, whe i call function second time so jQuery send two requests etc.
[02:27:24] <Cork> OverL: from where do you call ajaxLogin?
[02:28:09] <Nomikos> OverL: every time you call ajaxLogin you're adding the inner function to the form's submit event
[02:28:50] <OverL> Cork: from button wtih onclick event
[02:28:54] <OverL> *with
[02:28:56] <Cork> ah
[02:28:59] <Nomikos> OverL: I think you should just add it once by default, inside the jQuery block, without the function ajaxLogin(){ .. } around it?
[02:29:02] <ShawnRisk> when I use .HTML() this shows up as plain html, not rendered html, what am I doing wrong with this code, $.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").html())?
[02:29:37] <Cork> OverL: if you don't remove the form from the page, just bind the event, and use the function to show/hide the form
[02:30:18] <Cork> ShawnRisk: what are you doing with it after $.trim?
[02:30:57] <OverL> Cork: I don't remove form, just I hide him
[02:31:08] <Cork> thats what i said
[02:31:16] <Cork> don't bind the submit event in the form
[02:31:20] <Cork> do it on page load
[02:31:25] <Cork> then just hide the form
[02:31:32] <Cork> don't bind the event again
[02:31:44] <ShawnRisk> Cork: table = obj.next(), and obj = $(this).
[02:32:07] <Cork> ShawnRisk: and obj is the return value from $.trim?
[02:33:11] <ShawnRisk> Cork: right, but in straight plain text not html
[02:33:24] <OverL> Thanks you men
[02:33:34] <Cork> ShawnRisk: no its html, thats what your asking for
[02:33:38] <Nomikos> trim() just returns the string, it depends on how you put it back in the dom how it will show up
[02:33:43] <Cork> ShawnRisk: but your expecting dom objects, and thats not html
[02:34:07] <Cork> so you need to parse the html again
[02:34:17] <Cork> $($.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").html()))
[02:42:49] <ShawnRisk> Cork: nothing showed up when I did that.
[02:43:32] <Cork> there should be a jquery object
[02:43:47] <Cork> ahwait
[02:43:53] <Cork> you need a wrapping element too
[02:44:08] <Cork> try $('<div/>').append($.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").html()))
[02:44:29] <Cork> or might just as well be $('<div/>').html($.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").html()))
[02:44:43] <ShawnRisk> Cork: don't you mean </div>?
[02:44:49] <Cork> no
[02:44:59] <Cork> <div/> is the same as <div></div>
[02:45:11] <Cork> (in jquery)
[02:45:41] <ShawnRisk> right
[02:49:58] <mehrdad> i think we need an effing doc system  for jq
[02:50:05] <mehrdad> an integrated one if possible
[02:50:24] <Cork> effing?
[02:50:29] <mehrdad> in c# i could put three / and write an xml doc right within code
[02:50:47] <mehrdad> freaking*
[02:51:16] <Cork> mehrdad: just put it in an element where it belongs
[02:51:59] <mehrdad> and if i want to export it?
[02:52:16] <Cork> export?
[02:52:25] <mehrdad> like javadoc
[02:52:43] <Cork> you mean generate a file for the user to save?
[02:52:53] <mehrdad> yes
[02:53:01] <Cork> you use the File api
[02:53:21] <NihilistDandy> Or just a little awk script, as long as your doc comments are standardized
[02:53:39] <mehrdad> yeah, no standard doc system
[02:53:45] <mehrdad> each to his own stuff
[02:53:52] <mehrdad> but its ok i guess
[02:54:00] <ShawnRisk> Cork: this didn't help either.  My code goes <div /> <span /> <a />
[02:54:41] <Cork> ShawnRisk: i'm not sure what your talking about
[02:55:04] <Cork> ShawnRisk: when you run .html() in a selection it converts the dom objects back to html text
[02:55:12] <Cork> ShawnRisk: that means its just text
[02:55:34] <caruso_g> Any idea?
[02:55:37] <Cork> you then have to parse that text/html back into dom elements again to be able to work on it like it would be a tree
[02:55:48] <ShawnRisk> Cork: you mean it is not dynamic clickable text that will take me to another page?
[02:56:14] <Cork> ShawnRisk: it means its just text, no objects; just a string of characters
[02:57:12] <ShawnRisk> Cork: how do we return this to dom elements?
[02:57:54] <Cork> if the html is wrapped in a tag like <div></div> or <span> or similar
[02:57:57] <Nomikos> ShawnRisk: can you put a sample (10-20 lines) of what you are doing up on jsfiddle?
[02:58:07] <Cork> then just ask jquery to parse it $(<your html>)
[02:58:29] <Cork> ShawnRisk: if its not, you need a holding element for the content
[02:58:33] <ShawnRisk> Nomikos: can I pastebin this?
[02:58:40] <Cork> no
[02:58:50] <Cork> don't use dead text holders
[02:58:52] <Cork> use live js pages
[02:58:59] <Cork> like jsfiddle or jsbin
[02:59:00] <Nomikos> jsfiddle is easier, since you can run it and edit and run again
[03:00:06] <Qalqi> wats the difference between ajaxform and ajaxsubmit?
[03:01:31] <Nomikos> Qalqi: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#faq
[03:03:02] <Qalqi> come on
[03:03:08] <Qalqi> i read that already
[03:03:27] <Nomikos> Well, uh. I'd never even heard of this plugin. It's not standard jQuery
[03:03:37] <Nomikos> And your question is in there verbatim.
[03:04:59] <Qalqi> i am having hard time sending hard time figuring out how to get data from a server in django
[03:05:17] <Qalqi> so trying this plugin
[03:05:37] <mehrdad> send a soft time, works easier
[03:05:53] <mehrdad> :p
[03:05:57] <Qalqi> i am Lolling back here
[03:05:58] <Qalqi> :P
[03:06:40] <fotoflo> hi all. I have a question about $.when( array_of_$ajax_objects )  -- http://pastebin.com/nfvjpJvs  --   My when is apparently being called before any of the requests return
[03:06:42] <ShawnRisk> Cork: can you explain this more: "then just ask jquery to parse it $(<your html>)"?
[03:07:11] <fotoflo> why is this? how do i fix it?
[03:12:18] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I don't know the html off the fly that is why I can't do it that way
[03:24:10] <mehrdad> a variable need not be defined before referencing it using 'this'? is it correct?
[03:25:20] <mehrdad> this.$input_picker actually creates a var and assigns it in place right?
[03:33:52] <cyberrog> I'm trying to add custom components inside jquery ui dialog. I successfully added two inputs, but I want that when I click one of the fields, a datepicker shows. I've added the libraries and codes to script tag in the same file, but nothing happens. Any idea?
[03:43:39] <mehrdad> this.$input_picker = this.$element.find('oe_mqLayerManager_container');
[03:43:52] <mehrdad> $input_picker will be undefinede
[03:43:56] <mehrdad> undefined*
[03:44:19] <mehrdad> but in firbug, it shows $element filled with correct element
[03:44:59] <mehrdad> and i expect $input_picker to be set to the element oe_mqLayerManager_container
[03:45:08] <mehrdad> and the hierarchy is correct
[03:45:23] <mehrdad> and the code that i copied this from is working
[03:45:41] <mehrdad> same procedure but different elements
[03:46:33] <mehrdad> just throwing my thoughts here
[03:52:41] <mehrdad> ff crashed :-|
[03:54:18] <NihilistDandy> What's new? :P
[03:55:34] <mehrdad> the smugs bash ie all the time, now they should know
[04:18:59] <zatan> hi, why  $.getJson is called two times  one I am getting 301 Moved permanantly another one 200 OK ? http://jsfiddle.net/pa8Na/
[04:19:33] <john-dev> because you get redirected (that's what 301 does)
[04:20:22] <milkncookie> as someone new to jQuery, i'm trying to find examples of good code, and was wondering if this would be considered well-written jQuery: http://css-tricks.com/css3-clock/
[04:20:35] <milkncookie> i feel a lot of that is redundant
[04:21:08] <mehrdad> Caradigm
[04:21:20] <zatan> john-dev, thanks that helped me :)
[04:21:33] <john-dev> ;-)
[04:22:02] <john-dev> milkncookie, css-tricks always does..
[04:22:16] <milkncookie> john-dev: does what?
[04:22:25] <john-dev> good code's ;-)
[04:22:42] <milkncookie> so yes, that's good code?
[04:22:49] <john-dev> it's just modern, so there is mostly no support for old browsers..
[04:22:50] <john-dev> y
[04:23:06] <NihilistDandy> mehrdad: Caradigm?
[04:23:38] <milkncookie> john-dev: i feel like he could've cashed a few of those objects instead of calling them two times
[04:24:09] <xec> milkncookie: i have no idea why there are three setintervals with the same frequency, you could just put it all in one
[04:24:10] <NihilistDandy> I'm so glad IE 6 is practically off the radar, finally
[04:24:28] <john-dev> milkncookie, i didn't read that code from scratch, im jsut talking about experience..
[04:24:51] <john-dev> using this site*
[04:24:52] <xec> milkncookie: also, its much better to cache selectors than keep selecting over and over and over
[04:25:05] <milkncookie> xec: that's what i as thinking
[04:25:26] <milkncookie> was*
[04:25:26] <xec> milkncookie: this code is probably just proof of concept, to demonstrate what he's doing, not a finished product
[04:25:32] <milkncookie> i see
[04:25:32] <john-dev> indeed
[04:25:44] <john-dev> but it's not bad written or seomthing, it's maybe just a fast way
[04:25:57] <xec> inefficient, yes
[04:26:59] <xec> another thing that strikes me as odd is, the article starts out with "i was exploring css3 animations" and goes on to animate with javascript :P
[04:27:16] <xec> i am paraphrasing of course
[04:28:05] <ShawnRisk> I am using this code, $.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").text()) and want to pull html and use this as a dom element how do I do that? table = obj.next(), var obj = $(this),
[04:28:20] <mindis|wurk> mmmh, i don't think it's that wrong. technically it's probably more accurate to say "css3 features animated with javascript" but who cares :P
[04:29:20] <milkncookie> xec: well, it's animating with css3 using js :P
[04:29:33] <xec> milkncookie: indeed
[04:35:21] <xec> also, under alternatives - php is suggested
[04:35:52] <xec> sounds like a lot of server requests to animate using php :P
[04:36:05] <xec> yes, i'm bored okay
[04:44:21] <obelich> hiyas
[04:45:50] <obelich> one question i want to make a event where i click in to check box un hide a div and the if i click again it go hidden again we try this http://pastebin.com/gTW80Dta
[04:45:55] <obelich> buth it dont work :(
[04:46:52] <prawnsalad> hey guys, ive got a div position:relative. top:1px. however .position().top shows 18
[04:47:00] <prawnsalad> shouldnt that also show 1?
[04:47:54] <john-dev> .css('position')
[04:47:57] <john-dev> .css('top')
[04:48:45] <prawnsalad> john-dev: wont css('top') return the same as .position().top? or at least, should be the same?
[04:49:18] <john-dev> give it a try, i don't know :-/
[04:50:22] <obelich> one question i want to make a event where i click in to check box un hide a div and the if i click again it go hidden again we try this http://pastebin.com/gTW80Dta
[04:50:35] <obelich> sorry my english is bad i speak spanish
[04:51:12] <prawnsalad> john-dev: that works, but now im wondering why .position() doesnt as expected heh
[04:51:15] <prawnsalad> ty :)
[04:51:21] <john-dev> .change('click', -> .bind('click',..
[04:51:35] <john-dev> prawnsalad, i never used .position, i can't help you to find an answer, sry :-)
[04:51:59] <john-dev> and use if(..hasClass('..') to check if it's active or not..
[04:52:07] <john-dev> or use :selected
[04:53:01] <Viduthalai> what does mean barebone vote slider?
[04:53:36] <obelich> john-dev, can give some example please im very newbie in using jqeury
[04:55:56] <john-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/njGFf/
[04:55:57] <john-dev> like that
[04:57:02] <john-dev> gr
[04:57:11] <obelich> john-dev, thanks very mutch muchas gracias :)
[04:57:23] <john-dev> get it working first :-)
[04:58:15] <john-dev> and consider using animate to give it a flawless nice look :-)
[04:58:21] <milkncookie> on.() is the same as bind.(), right?
[04:58:25] <john-dev> no
[04:58:49] <john-dev> .on is a live function, .bind only trigger if an event before the dom finished loading
[04:58:54] <milkncookie> i was under the impression that bind, live, delegate all pointed to .on
[04:59:01] <milkncookie> ah i see
[04:59:04] <erichynds> no
[04:59:04] <bot-t> (6 hours 48 mins ago) <paul_irish> tell erichynds good picks on spotify
[04:59:07] <erichynds> on can be a live function
[04:59:18] <john-dev> live is deprecated, so don't use it
[04:59:29] <erichynds> if you pass it a selector to delegate
[05:01:51] <milkncookie> "As of jQuery 1.7, the http://api.jquery.com/on method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[05:02:04] <Zogot> aye milk is right
[05:02:07] <Zogot> thats what I thought too
[05:02:19] <john-dev> milkncookie, yes, it is..
[05:02:32] <obelich> john-dev, i add the script but it onli show it and ton hide again :( buth try this buth the same onli unhide but no hide again http://jsfiddle.net/2cJDK/
[05:02:32] <john-dev> it at least means don't use .live
[05:03:03] <john-dev> you don't need that seconds part
[05:03:14] <john-dev> the first part checks what to do using an if/else statement
[05:03:43] <milkncookie> john-dev: in the source it says "bind: function( types, data, fn ) {
[05:03:43] <milkncookie> 		return this.on( types, null, data, fn );
[05:03:43] <milkncookie> 	},"
[05:03:46] <obelich> john-dev, i try with onli one buth the same result
[05:04:13] <john-dev> ad your html code to jsfiddle (and css), so we can work there together..
[05:04:38] <Noeble> question: I get some info via json in my script and append it into a div on my page. Its done via a dropdown selector filter. Deppending on what I choose it gets different content. Problem is that after pageload the css background on each div that I appended blinks like 5times quick and then stops. Anyone has any idea why? http://dpaste.com/703073/
[05:05:27] <discountrobot> Hey guys, could somebody point me to the site with jquery devided into modules?
[05:06:33] <john-dev> Noeble, consider usign jsfiddle..
[05:06:38] <john-dev> It's hard to help you like that
[05:08:17] <john-dev> btw why do you hide elements, just to show them one line later?
[05:09:12] <Ortund> I need to make a small slideshow that is NOT interactive... What would be the best way for me to reference the image paths without having them somewhere else on the page?
[05:09:24] <Ortund> pre-defined vars I guess could work
[05:09:44] <john-dev> further you can use .html instead of .append, so you wouldn't need to empty that div first..
[05:10:09] <Noeble> john-dev: hmm
[05:10:17] <john-dev> Ortund, an array
[05:10:18] <john-dev> :-)
[05:10:51] <Ortund> john-dev as soon as I was done answering the question I came to that exact same conclusion
[05:10:52] <obelich> john-dev, http://jsfiddle.net/2cJDK/
[05:11:05] <john-dev> ;-)
[05:11:35] <john-dev> obelich, wrong link
[05:11:48] <Ortund> jquery that has no attached html confuses the hell out of me
[05:12:10] <Noeble> john-dev: first paste was the wrong one. This is the current working version. http://jsfiddle.net/qvk7M/
[05:12:27] <obelich> lol sorry is the firs time i use this one :P i click run i i suppose it change :P
[05:12:28] <obelich> http://jsfiddle.net/2cJDK/1/
[05:12:45] <john-dev> Noeble, you need to add the div's too, i can't see that effect yet..
[05:13:33] <Ortund> john-dev so now, how do I have the images stay visible in my slideshow for say... 10 seconds before moving on to the next one
[05:13:47] <Noeble> john-dev: divs are appended just fine, problem is that in chrome to be specific, thecss background seem to blink annoyingly a cpl of times before it stops
[05:14:05] <john-dev> Ortund, setTimeout? don't know :-/
[05:15:44] <john-dev> obelich, you want to bind that click event to a checkbox right?
[05:15:58] <similian> when i recieve data from a request how can I use jqery selector on that data if its html?
[05:16:22] <obelich> ye
[05:16:23] <obelich> yep
[05:16:32] <john-dev> but it's bound to the input field :-/
[05:17:05] <similian>  success: function(data) {  $('#popuplayer').html($(data)find('#popup'));}
[05:17:15] <similian> is something like this possible?
[05:17:26] <john-dev> similian, i don't know if that is possible but you can .load only specified div's
[05:17:45] <john-dev> $(data) wont work..
[05:17:57] <similian> whats the proper syntax ?
[05:18:16] <similian> i have to update multiple divs in my application case
[05:18:20] <john-dev> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container');
[05:18:20] <similian> 1. a popup
[05:18:38] <similian> 2. the source div
[05:18:59] <john-dev> similian, i would do it in two steps..
[05:19:27] <similian> i have a #message div and a #popup div in my data
[05:19:48] <john-dev> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container');
[05:19:52] <john-dev> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #theotherone');
[05:20:04] <similian> i see
[05:20:15] <similian> and with data I cannot?
[05:20:25] <john-dev> just use two steps
[05:20:25] <john-dev> i don't know it this is possible..
[05:20:39] <similian> okay well thanks I will do two steps
[05:20:50] <john-dev> maybe someone else knows
[05:21:07] <similian> i found this topic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/704679/parse-html-string-with-jquery
[05:21:24] <similian> but I cant get it work
[05:21:30] <similian> maybe syntax issues
[05:21:50] <Ortund> john-dev: .delay() looks like a definite possibility
[05:22:09] <john-dev> Ortund, yepp, that could work..
[05:22:49] <obelich> john-dev, buth is bind with the id
[05:24:07] <john-dev> $('#automovil').bind('click', function() { <- this cant work, you want to use one of your checkboxes here..
[05:24:10] <john-dev> #automvil is your input field
[05:25:03] <john-dev> if you want your input field use .on('focus'..
[05:25:24] <sjobidoo> Hi all :) Anyone who could help me out as to whats incorrect in my if-statement here:  http://pastebin.com/5u7mT1mB   ? :)
[05:25:41] <obelich> john-dev, cambiando :)
[05:25:54] <sjobidoo> when i click the item which HAS the class 'current-menu-parent' it still goes through :/
[05:25:55] <john-dev> sjobidoo, first, change .live to .on :-)
[05:26:42] <sjobidoo> john-dev:  done...no change :p
[05:26:47] <john-dev> of course not :)
[05:26:49] <sjobidoo> hehe
[05:27:11] <obelich> john-dev, thanks for the help i go to studing more about jquery :P
[05:27:11] <john-dev> obelich, raither it's not needed to use different clases here, since us can use .css to change the stylesheet propterties..
[05:27:19] <john-dev> ok :)
[05:27:52] <john-dev> line 2 -> event.target -> this
[05:28:10] <john-dev> and use hasClass instead of .not
[05:28:59] <john-dev> and .id should be .attr('id')
[05:30:00] <sjobidoo> updated: http://pastebin.com/yLxUQ8Ee
[05:31:27] <kevindougans> anyone know how i can change adapt.js to load in 2 style sheets as opposed to just 1
[05:32:20] <kevindougans> i need it to load in the default 720.css or 960.css then also load in a custom 960.css for that page too
[05:32:23] <john-dev> alert("honk honk"); <- nice :-P
[05:33:29] <sjobidoo> john-dev: :P  i still don't get any honking though :/
[05:33:32] <john-dev> sjobidoo, redescripe your problem pls
[05:33:40] <john-dev> can you show me the page?
[05:33:44] <sjobidoo> ya sec
[05:34:14] <sjobidoo> send you link
[05:34:16] <sjobidoo> sent*
[05:43:21] <kevindougans> anyone know much about adapt.js?
[05:43:56] <kevindougans> i basically want to run it twice on one page, or have it include 2 css files instead of just the one
[05:45:55] <ShawnRisk> I am using this code, $.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").text()) and want to pull html and use this as a dom element how do I do that? table = obj.next(), var obj = $(this),
[05:46:37] <Ortund> Is this right? -> $("#slider").delay(1000).html("<img src=""" + FullPath + arr(i + 1) + """ />");
[05:46:55] <clawfire> hi there
[05:48:56] <lxg> hey guys, little question: how can i catch the creating of an element?
[05:49:18] <lxg> like live('click', callback), only the event being the creating of the element
[05:49:27] <clawfire> hi guys (and girlz), anyone can help me with cross domain json POST call (maybe jsonp ?)
[05:53:01] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to do like a .live append?
[05:53:19] <john-dev> jeffsmykil, what do you mean?
[05:53:20] <jeffsmykil> I have something that needs to go in an elemetn that isn't there when the dom loads
[05:53:37] <john-dev> .on
[05:53:53] <john-dev> .on('click'.. <- .trigger('click')
[05:54:44] <john-dev> lxg i think you need to trigger it as soon as your created it
[05:55:21] <lxg> john-dev: i had this idea, too, but it seemed "dirty" to me ;)
[05:55:22] <john-dev> like .html('<div id="test">…'); bind an on event to that "not existing" div and use .trigger('click')
[05:55:34] <john-dev> lxg yes, it is, i don't know a better solution too
[05:55:39] <lxg> john-dev: but ok, i'll try and dig some more in the jQuery source ;)
[05:55:49] <john-dev> :)
[05:56:06] <jeffsmykil> can you use on on a success?
[05:56:28] <john-dev> .html doesn't have a onSuccess event
[05:56:32] <john-dev> an*
[05:57:05] <lxg> jeffsmykil: do you want to attach an event to the created element? then use .live() or better: .on()
[05:57:31] <lxg> jeffsmykil: oh, i see you are aware of .live()
[05:57:44] <john-dev> [14:53]  <john-dev> .on('click'.. <- .trigger('click') :-)
[05:57:55] <jeffsmykil> im trying to use .html on an element that doesn't exist on dom load
[05:57:59] <K3|Chris|Work> how would I use two different PHP strings depending on what jQuery if statement results in?
[05:58:02] <john-dev> .live is deprecated, use .on
[05:58:22] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/32FLz/          <<< never seen the error I get from this
[05:58:22] <Ortund> Default.aspx:186Uncaught TypeError: Property 'arr' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[05:59:15] <john-dev> K3|Chris|Work you can only do this using $.ajax
[06:00:06] <mehrdad> anyone know anything about nodeType property?
[06:00:08] <K3|Chris|Work> :\
[06:00:16] <mehrdad> is it part of jquery libs?
[06:00:22] <john-dev> arr(i+1) -> arr[i+1]
[06:00:47] <john-dev> @Ortund
[06:01:20] <john-dev> you do call the function arr, which doesn't exist since you try to use an array..
[06:01:41] <lxg> Ortund: and, if you want three elements into an array, simple write: [elem1, elem2, elem3]
[06:02:26] <Ortund> lxg, how does that set the values to them then? or do I later reference arr[0] = "derp"; ?
[06:02:56] <john-dev> you do
[06:03:00] <lxg> Ortund: right: myArray = [e1, e2, e3]; alert(myArray[0])
[06:06:31] <soc42> hi #jquery
[06:06:33] <soc42> are there any known errors/malfunctions about jquery on ie9?
[06:07:44] <Elisha> uhm, hello, I have a problem with jquery deleting a tr element from tbody, it sets all the elements to undefined rather than deleting a row
[06:09:06] <lxg> Elisha: what method do you use to remove the tr
[06:09:36] <Elisha> ah I found the bug
[06:09:37] <Elisha> :)
[06:09:39] <lxg> Elisha: try $('#your-tbody tr').remove()
[06:09:49] <Elisha> remove is actually successful
[06:10:03] <Elisha> but I have one more listener on a button
[06:11:43] <Elisha> thanks lxg :)
[06:11:49] <lxg> Elisha: np :)
[06:13:47] <Ortund> my jquery doesn't have errors in it, but the delay isn't rotating the images
[06:19:37] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/32FLz/1/           <<< the delay() doesn't seem to be working
[06:22:38] <DerekPioneer>  do i further select on a $this?
[06:22:46] <DerekPioneer> $('.textAlign').find('li img')
[06:22:54] <DerekPioneer> wait nvm
[06:28:43] <Gozzy> Ortund delay is working it just never gets there
[06:30:02] <soc42> ok, seems that .change()-event didn't fire in ie9, so used .keyup() instead which works like a charm
[06:31:17] <Ortund> Gozzy because there's a problem with i?
[06:35:21] <iNerd> Hi. Could anyone help me with a very simple bit of jquery? Trying to get a mouseover of an image to show/hide a caption div but I'm entirely new to this and it's flummoxing me enitirely
[06:36:41] <john-dev> .mouseover
[06:39:00] <K3|Chris|Work> http://api.jquery.com/hover/ ?
[06:39:32] <iNerd> Hover is what i was trying
[06:40:21] <iNerd> but trying something like $("div.rg-image").hover(.fadeOut(100), .fadeIn(500)); is not working. Clearly i'm doing something wrong.
[06:42:09] <blackspotwiggins> ?learn @ iNerd
[06:42:10] <bot-t> iNerd, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[06:43:49] <nFFF> Anyone have a hetzner.de dedicated server and ahving issues?
[06:44:26] <john-dev> nFFF, yepp, they got problems..
[06:44:32] <john-dev> http://hetzner-status.de/
[06:45:13] <K3|Chris|Work> iNerd: you're doing it really wrong, look at the example at the link I gave you, and yeah learn some JS, though honestly speaking I'm not that good with JS but ok with JQ
[06:46:01] <K3|Chris|Work> learn the syntax and the rest is easy
[06:46:53] <john-dev> iNerd, try. $("div.rg-image").on('mouseover',function() { $('div.rg-image').fadeout(100); }); <- something like this
[06:46:53] <john-dev> but you probably want #rg-image..
[06:50:30] <K3|Chris|Work> john-dev: is there an advantage to mouseover over hover?
[06:51:07] <mehrdad> in js a null , undefined value evaluates to false, right?
[06:51:15] <john-dev> i just never used .on('hover')..
[06:51:16] <john-dev> :-)
[06:51:29] <danheberden> ?eval [ !!null, !!undefined]
[06:51:30] <mehrdad> like in python
[06:51:32] <bot-t> danheberden: [false, false]
[06:51:40] <danheberden> ?tias @ mehrdad
[06:51:40] <bot-t> mehrdad, Try It And See
[06:51:42] <danheberden> :D
[06:52:07] <mehrdad> good tip
[06:52:21] <danheberden> chrome console is, like, the best playground ever :D
[06:52:30] <danheberden> or firebug if you're *one of them*
[06:52:57] <mehrdad> syntax error hah
[06:53:01] <iNerd> so http://pastebin.com/KzMNNGFF seems closer. but still wrong.
[06:53:03] <mehrdad> in firebug console
[06:53:12] <danheberden> mehrdad with what?
[06:53:40] <mehrdad> ok, removed the ? and it returns undefined
[06:53:52] <danheberden> mehrdad the ?eval part is for the bot-t
[06:53:53] <bot-t> danheberden, Invalid key: "mehrdad the ?eval part" (Char 13).
[06:54:05] <danheberden> just type !!null
[06:54:12] <mehrdad> damn
[06:54:15] <mehrdad> *blush*
[06:54:20] <danheberden> no worries mate :D
[06:54:47] <danheberden> you could also try like if ( null ) { console.log( 'null bitches' ); } else { console.log( 'false?! OH YES!' ); }
[06:54:51] <mehrdad> yeah, returns false
[06:54:54] <mehrdad> thx
[06:54:55] <danheberden> the !! is just handy
[06:54:58] <danheberden> of course
[06:55:26] <mehrdad> yeah nice trick
[06:55:27] <danheberden> But 0, null, undefined, an empty string
[06:55:30] <danheberden> all falsy
[06:55:52] <mehrdad> needed to make sure
[06:55:56] <danheberden> but an empty array? that's true
[06:56:03] <mehrdad> all scripting languages are like so?
[06:56:12] <mehrdad> python acts the same i know
[06:56:22] <danheberden> yeah, definitely playing by different rules sometimes
[06:57:53] <SaadIbrahim> hey guys
[06:58:00] <SaadIbrahim> i want to style my dropdowns like this: http://screensnapr.com/v/AwuZZz.png
[06:58:09] <SaadIbrahim> know of nay scriipt which would make it easy for me
[06:58:48] <john-dev> SaadIbrahim, you raither need a book..
[06:59:15] <SaadIbrahim> :o john-dev
[06:59:19] <SaadIbrahim> why do you say so?
[07:01:37] <john-dev> SaadIbrahim, we don't write navigations in here :-/
[07:01:46] <john-dev> it's css btw, not jquery you are looking for..
[07:02:10] <SaadIbrahim> never mind
[07:02:21] <xec> well, to be fair - you can't really style select lists with css - you would need to replace it with a javascript equivalent
[07:02:22] <SaadIbrahim> i found a plugin which will prolly do the trick
[07:02:36] <SaadIbrahim> ^^ what xec said
[07:02:37] <SaadIbrahim> http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/
[07:02:40] <SaadIbrahim> ^ the plugin
[07:04:26] <john-dev> xec i admit
[07:16:12] <Ashfame> jQuery can't seem to pick up the value of an input field. this works -  console.log( $('#aname-input') ); but this doesnt -  console.log( $('#aname-input').val() ); // gives an empty string
[07:16:16] <abourget> Anyone knows about 'SlickGrid' ?
[07:17:21] <batlhazar> Doing var wrapped = element.wrap('div'); returns me only element and not the element wrapped with the div. How can I store that created dom element directly to a variable?
[07:18:47] <xec> ?demo @ Ashfame
[07:18:47] <bot-t> Ashfame, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:19:51] <xec> batlhazar: var div = $("<div>"); element.wrap(div); ?
[07:20:15] <xec> i'm just guessing here
[07:21:00] <nFFF> :D
[07:21:09] <john-dev> nFFF, hetzner is back up..
[07:28:27] <dwarder> i have a .click event associated with a certain id how can i programmaticaly click it?
[07:28:32] <dwarder> i.e. fire this event
[07:30:44] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[07:31:39] <Mosselmaniac> i have jquery datepicker initialised, and it is working. now i want to set the minDate option dynamically, but this isn't working.
[07:31:45] <Mosselmaniac> I use: $('.date-pick').datepick({minDate: val});
[07:32:46] <Vaerros> well, it's .datepicker('option', 'minDate', [new val])
[07:32:57] <Vaerros> (is one way)
[07:33:03] <Mosselmaniac> mine is wrong?
[07:33:27] <Vaerros> the object passing in part, maybe not, but it would be .datepicker not .datepick
[07:33:32] <donCams> hello :)
[07:34:07] <Mosselmaniac> Vaerros: it sais .datepicker is not a functino
[07:34:12] <Mosselmaniac> $('.date-pick').datepicker('option', 'minDate', val);
[07:34:40] <Vaerros> Mosselmaniac: which version of jqueryui?
[07:35:24] <fof> are you missing an each()?
[07:35:34] <intellilogic> $(this).data(databit).mykey = myvalue;  //it's asigning to "mykey" and not the variable
[07:35:41] <Mosselmaniac> Vaerros: 1.8.1
[07:36:03] <Mosselmaniac> fof, me?
[07:36:14] <Mosselmaniac> intellilogic: is that to me? lol
[07:36:33] <intellilogic> No, I need help
[07:36:34] <fof> you're selecting a class
[07:36:38] <Vaerros> dwarder: look into .trigger(you can also just do .click(), conventionally iirc)
[07:37:16] <Vaerros> Mosselmaniac: almost sounds like you're using some old, pre- jqueryui datepicker or something
[07:37:25] <Vaerros> or pre- [datepicker was added to jqueryui]
[07:37:29] <intellilogic> $(this).data(databit).mykey = myvalue;  //it's asigning to "mykey" and not the variable - myvalue is working properly.  HELP!?
[07:37:54] <dwarder> Vaerros: thanks, i'll take a look in documentation
[07:37:54] <Mosselmaniac> fof: $('#datefield').datepicker('option', 'minDate', val);
[07:37:58] <Mosselmaniac> doesn't work too.
[07:38:24] <Mosselmaniac> but Vaerros: $('.date-pick').datepick(datepickerOptions);
[07:38:28] <Mosselmaniac> does work, when initialised.
[07:39:03] <Vaerros> Mosselmaniac: then it's either an old version of jqueryui that the documentation doesn't cover and I'm not familiar with or it's some third party plugin
[07:40:16] <Mosselmaniac> Vaerros: ouch so what should i do now :(
[07:41:11] <Vaerros> Mosselmaniac: well I can't 'see' your code or codebase so I can't tell you :\
[07:42:11] <avillanueva-npr> Hey, jQuery, I have a question: http://pastebin.com/i72b0but
[07:42:26] <intellilogic> can someone look at my issue?
[07:42:42] <avillanueva-npr> I think it comes down to scoping but I'm not entirely sure that is the problem.
[07:44:32] <nFFF> intellilogic whats your issue?
[07:44:44] <intellilogic>  $(this).data(databit).mykey = myvalue;  //it's asigning to "mykey" and not the variable - myvalue is working properly.  HELP!?

[07:51:15] <kumar> ihave tryed with all way (i hope so)
[07:51:46] <ajpiano> kumar: can you make a testcase on jsfiddle?
[07:51:58] <ajpiano> cause otherwise, anything you were triyng to post to trac for the last 5 hours would have been useless anyway
[07:51:59] <kumar> yes I will give you rigt now
[07:52:06] <nFFF> intellilogic,
[07:52:22] <nFFF> I don't know whats going on with your code
[07:52:32] <nFFF> $(this).data(databit).mykey = myvalue; // especialy this
[07:53:11] <nFFF> why not: mykey = myvalue; $(this).data(databit, mykey);
[07:53:33] <nFFF> or just pass myvalue directly
[07:53:50] <intellilogic> $(this).data('aj').Foo = 'bar';  $(this).data('aj').Foo //bar   -  Now I am trying to make a function that does that and some other stuff
[07:55:44] <kumar> 1.	Select radio button from 2nd  group (any one) and click on the Send Button,  it show perfect result. 2.	Now select any Radio button from 1st group and click on the first Button, it show the Perfect result. 3.	Now click on the 2nd button, it show the result, which us wrong.

[08:01:36] <monk13> Any web browsers without a console I can download? (don't want to dl Virtual-PC with IE6 that Windows provides. too big :) ). already have new FF/Chrome/IE. need another browser that doesnt have console so i can test my 'FauxConsole'
[08:02:07] <NoiseEee> monk13: you should certainly be able to test it regardless of whether the browser has a native console
[08:02:31] <NoiseEee> re: something like eloquentjavascript.net
[08:02:42] <monk13> NoiseEee, how so? my console.log's will just goto the native console. I only override it if not supported.
[08:03:25] <monk13> you saying I should just comment out my code, so overrides in all situations, and test in FF? i could do that.
[08:03:34] <Ashfame> jQuery can't seem to pick up the value of an input field. this works -  console.log( $('#aname-input') ); but this doesnt -  console.log( $('#aname-input').val() ); // gives an empty string
[08:03:54] <Ashfame>    Demo - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12633923/anuj/index.html
[08:04:23] <Ashfame> click the grey box below blue buttons
[08:04:57] <Ashfame> xec: Got a demo now :D
[08:06:11] <xec> Ashfame: doing $('#aname-input') in console returns null
[08:06:35] <Ashfame> it shows the element in console itself
[08:06:42] <Ashfame> .val() returns empty string
[08:06:48] <monk13> Ashfame, maybe it needs name="" a value?
[08:07:10] <xec> Ashfame: also, $ == jQuery returns false :P
[08:07:43] <Ashfame> I have wrapped my code in (function($){    .....   })(jQuery);
[08:08:15] <Ashfame> monk13: it has a name too, but why would it need that when selecting from an ID
[08:09:15] <Ashfame> Point is jQuery picks up the element by ID but can't pick up its value that I have typed it in
[08:10:44] <xec> Ashfame: i renamed the id to "trololol" and it works
[08:10:54] <Ashfame> haha
[08:11:26] <monk13> hmmm, Do you have an id somewhere else called that?
[08:11:28] <Ashfame> whats wrong with aname-input? jQuery doesn't like it? *foreveralone*
[08:11:28] <xec> Ashfame: jQuery('[id="aname-input"]').length  returns 2
[08:11:39] <JAAulde> please refresh my memory...how would I call the "bar" method of a "foo" UI widget, passing multiple params... I know it's $collectionObj.foo("bar") for calling the method, but what is the format for passing multiple params to bar?
[08:11:50] <xec> monk13: indeed
[08:11:54] <monk13> blah
[08:12:06] * xec flexes
[08:12:10] <Ashfame> monk13: no I dnt have two elements with same ID
[08:12:19] <Ashfame> xec: let me check that
[08:12:22] <xec> Ashfame: haha yes you do!! :D
[08:12:29] <monk13> ;)
[08:12:35] <Ashfame> lol, where? I couldn't find it
[08:12:50] <xec> don't ask me, i didn't code this soup ;)
[08:13:03] <Ashfame> nor did I :P
[08:15:06] <astropirate> No soup for you!
[08:20:32] <shwaiil> hi
[08:21:07] <shwaiil> Q: how to get current selector name ? for example $('.get-me') how to get "get-me" ? I'm asking this because this may be useful for DRY inside a .each . any tip ? tks
[08:22:41] <Phoenixz> danzik171: I suppose that would be $('<div id='foobar'>blah blah<div>').find('#foobar').dosomething() ?
[08:25:34] <antdillon> shwaiil, check out: http://jsfiddle.net/Z75MA/1/
[08:26:17] <shwaiil> antdillon: tks for looking
[08:26:27] <shwaiil> but what if you are inside a .each loop ?
[08:26:30] <antdillon> shwaiil, no prob
[08:26:44] <shwaiil> $('.here').each( function(k, v) { ... } );
[08:26:59] <shwaiil> how to get ".here" instead of hardtyping it inside { .. }
[08:27:22] <jes> I have a lot of divs with similar names car1, car2... etc how do I hide the div that I clicked?
[08:27:32] <jes> names/ids
[08:28:00] <antdillon> shwaiil, http://jsfiddle.net/Z75MA/3/ ?
[08:28:30] <shwaiil> antdillon: thanks :) nice one
[08:31:25] <kirbysayshi> jes: I"m assuming you're talking about the clicked element in an event handler? jQuery sets the element as 'this'.
[08:32:01] <albertosh> I'm running with this message when trying to do a DELETE $.ajax request. Any ideas?
[08:32:03] <albertosh> Method DELETE is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods
[08:34:51] <jes> kirbysayshi: yes, but how do I know which element was clicked? is it #car1 or #car2 or #car*?
[08:37:20] <NoiseEee> jes: written properly, it will be 'this'.   http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials.
[08:37:21] <erichynds> jes: if(this.id === "car1") {}
[08:37:36] <WebDragon> heya folkz
[08:37:38] * WebDragon kick-starts the bottomless coffeepot and waits for the multiple *peRk*GaSmS to start... 
[08:38:26] <WebDragon> anyone here familiar with the old vs. new analytics code ? I've got a nice trick I used to use with the old analytics code for tracking offsite and download links within analytics, but I can't figure out how to work it into the NEW analytics code
[08:38:33] <dwarder> $('#id').trigger('click',["14", "00","16","00"]); am i understand right that arguments[0] shoud equal 14?
[08:38:38] <jes> erichynds: I have an ifinite number of cars...
[08:38:42] <dwarder> should *
[08:38:49] <WebDragon> the old way worked like this http://pastebin.com/RqmCTvup  which also has a sample of the new analytics code for comparison
[08:39:07] <WebDragon> it was quite the nifty trick, and I'd really like to be able to keep using it
[08:39:22] <WebDragon> I just can't seem to wrap my brain around how, however
[08:39:41] <WebDragon> it's not as obvious as it used to be, for me
[08:40:18] <xec> jes: that doesn't change anything. this.id would be whatever the id of the clicked element
[08:40:56] <xec> jes: and i think you mean "unknown" rather than "infinite" ;)
[08:41:08] <WebDragon> I'd been using jquery to do the manipulation, but perhaps this question is better asked in #javascript ?
[08:42:04] <brettster> hey guys
[08:42:15] <brettster> This is kind of pertaining to a cms but not really
[08:42:25] <jes> xec: so how do i make the clicked element (whose id I do not know) for example toggle?

[08:43:16] <brettster> that's my code
[08:43:26] <brettster> i need it to loop through every 4 users
[08:43:32] <brettster> right now it'

[08:43:47] <brettster> so let
[08:43:51] <john2496> hey guys, how do i remove classes from an element that begin with 'page-*'?
[08:43:52] <WebDragon> longer sentences brettster
[08:43:59] <WebDragon> stop using <ENTER> as punctuation
[08:44:01] <WebDragon> you
[08:44:04] <WebDragon> create too
[08:44:04] <john2496> eg, $('#ele').removeClass('page-*')
[08:44:05] <WebDragon> much scroll
[08:44:15] <WebDragon> heya ajpiano ;)
[08:44:16] <brettster> 's say i have 13 users - how would i get it to loop through every 4?
[08:44:54] * WebDragon waits a bit before repasting his question
[08:45:08] <brettster> sorry
[08:45:10] <brettster> got kicked
[08:45:12] <brettster> but
[08:45:14] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3381912
[08:45:17] <xec> lol
[08:45:24] <brettster> again - trying to loop through every 4
[08:45:30] <WebDragon> brettster: stop using <ENTER> as punctuation. type longer sentences. use paragraphs
[08:45:34] <xec> brettster: we got it the first time round
[08:45:38] <brettster> I'm seriously sorry
[08:45:39] <brettster> lol
[08:45:43] <WebDragon> you create way too much scroll the way you're typing now
[08:45:50] <brettster> I user enter as punctuation habitually
[08:45:58] <WebDragon> my questions' already two screens back and I only just got done asking it
[08:46:19] <xec> WebDragon: sorry, but i doubt anyone can answer it anyway ;)
[08:46:23] <WebDragon> yeah you gotta break that habit here. the scroll in here is bad enough what with 936 users ;)
[08:46:53] <xec> it's better now, only 935
[08:47:13] <xec> dammit
[08:47:20] <WebDragon> xec: well I'm just hoping anyone's familiar enough with the new analytics code and how it works to give me some pointers in the right direction so I can go off and figure it out. right now I'm utterly lost in how it's changed vs the old way
[08:47:24] <albertosh> Im getting: Method DELETE is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods doing a simple $.ajax call
[08:47:31] <albertosh> Any ideas how to overcome this?
[08:48:27] <brettster> anyone avail?
[08:49:29] <xec> brettster: you pastie is... PHP code?
[08:49:35] <xec> your*
[08:49:50] <brettster> yeahhh
[08:49:53] <brettster> php, js
[08:49:56] <brettster> it's just looping
[08:50:08] <brettster> the php is looping into jcycle
[08:50:22] <brettster> i just need it to loop through at least 4 profiles at a time
[08:50:39] <xec> ?demo @ brettster
[08:50:39] <bot-t> brettster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:51:07] <brettster> http://broomegop.com.s142783.gridserver.com
[08:51:10] <xec> brettster: i'm not about to try and manually parse your php mentally
[08:51:10] <brettster> box on the left
[08:51:38] <xec> what about it
[08:51:43] <brettster> so
[08:51:53] <brettster> the php is looping through one member at a time
[08:52:02] <brettster> i need it to loop through at most 4
[08:52:14] <brettster> so 4 profiles show up in the box at a time
[08:52:16] <brettster> instead of 1
[08:52:27] <xec> this sounds an awful lot like a php question
[08:53:15] <brettster> ahh
[08:53:26] <brettster> there is no-one helpful in the php room
[08:53:57] <xec> so you thought you should ask #jquery about php loops rather than look it up on google :)
[08:53:58] <WebDragon> does occasionally require patience
[08:54:09] <WebDragon> ##php is pretty busy too
[08:55:53] <WebDragon> xec: so you think I might be better off asking in #javascript ?
[08:56:32] <xec> WebDragon: honestly, no idea, maybe google analytics have a forum or something
[08:56:57] <WebDragon> yeah possibly, worth a quick query on freenode
[09:04:59] <supsup> is there an easy way to get int value from a css value string like 90px or do i have to use parseInt on it?
[09:05:20] <supsup> i mean parseint is easy too just easier
[09:05:28] <NoiseEee> what could possibly be easier?
[09:05:35] <supsup> .getInt()
[09:05:36] <shwaiil> Q: This is looking to ugly, how to write this cleaner ? $('.imageGallery').eq( myIndex ).children('.list').children('li').length
[09:05:38] <shwaiil> thanks for looking
[09:05:39] <supsup> or something in the chain
[09:05:51] <NoiseEee> supsup: why wouldn't you use parseInt() in the chain?
[09:05:51] <gf3> supsup: what CSS value?
[09:06:05] <supsup> parseInt dont work on chain
[09:06:18] <supsup> u have to pass parseint params not chain it
[09:06:25] <ajpiano> supsup: jquery doesn't wrap every single native javascript method just so you can feel warm and fuzzy
[09:06:44] <supsup> well well i am so cold now tho can't a brotha get a blanket
[09:07:17] <gf3> supsup: yo, which CSS value?
[09:07:22] <supsup> was just checkin -- i mean i used parseInt just figured there might be 'easier' way
[09:07:23] <supsup> top
[09:07:37] <gf3> ajpiano: but doesn't jQuery stand for Javascript Query1?!?!
[09:07:46] <gf3> supsup: yes, use parseInt
[09:07:53] <jes> I have a container div that holds children divs and each child has a div that I want to show when clicked on. I did that. Now how do hide all other grandchild divs?
[09:08:19] <gf3> jes: Make a JS Fiddle showing us what you have so far
[09:08:43] <geekbuntu> does anyone recall what the button beside the datepicker input field is called? not finding it in docs - wondering if it has been deprecated
[09:09:29] <jes> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/550938/
[09:13:16] <jes> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/550944/
[09:13:49] <jes> car name shouldn't hide, but when i click on it the child should show and all other car child divs (except for the name) should hide.

[09:30:48] <LukeNukem> Hello, im doing manipulation with jquery, taking the value of a data attribute, add it with 1 and then use the .html to change the real data
[09:31:08] <LukeNukem> if the data attributes value is 0, one added to it is (0 + 1) 1, but jquery gives me 01(same thing, but i want 1)
[09:31:12] <LukeNukem> how can i get 1 instead of 01

[09:32:09] <nFFF> you basically are treating the numbers as strings
[09:32:14] <nFFF> you need to cast them to int
[09:32:18] <LukeNukem> oh thanks.
[09:32:31] <nFFF> Not sure if parseInt is the correct function
[09:32:35] <nFFF> but there will be one like that

[09:39:30] <LukeNukem> its confusing
[09:40:08] <nFFF> LukeNukem, parseInt(string);
[09:40:24] <nFFF> converters the string into integer
[09:40:54] <LukeNukem> so
[09:41:10] <LukeNukem> var newnumber = parseInt(oldnumber)+1;
[09:41:17] <nFFF> yes
[09:41:18] <ShawnRisk> nFFF: I just tried that and now nothing shows up.  Here is the full code: $.trim(table.find(".featuredlistname").text()) table = obj.next() var obj = $(this)

[10:01:43] <supsup> how bad is this idea:   using javascropt to control presentation/move a fixed position navigation?  like real bad or really really bad or just like meh?!  http://jsfiddle.net/4WpN7/2/
[10:02:16] <supsup> this is not really important just was wondering about fixed stuff - never use it
[10:02:29] <supsup> I never use fixed position that is
[10:07:29] <faz> hi all. I am trying to create a dynamic jquery form when the user clicks on a link on my page and when they click the submit button on that form the date is posted to another php page. Can someone guide me on how i can add a submit function to this dynamic form and the correct way to adding the form elements
[10:08:50] <supsup> give form id, attach submit event to form
[10:08:53] <supsup> via ID
[10:09:04] <supsup> ? .submit()
[10:09:05] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[10:09:12] <supsup> ? .css()
[10:09:12] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[10:10:19] <supsup> i guess if ur making form on link click first add click event to link and in that make the form, give it an id, attach submit even to it etc..
[10:10:21] <faz> i tried binding the submit event to the form but for some reason the page refreshes without submitting any data
[10:10:37] <supsup> did u set action correctly on form?
[10:11:12] <supsup> is form ajax form or normal submit form?  a form when submitted tends to redirect user to it's action location.
[10:11:32] <supsup> if ajax form you will need to address that in the submit event attached to form
[10:12:02] <faz> well what i wanted was for the form to not refresh so in my submit fucntion i added e.preventDefault for the page to not refresh but since its refreshing i dont think binding the submit function to the form worked
[10:12:23] <supsup> yah prob not
[10:12:24] <faz> sorry i meant the page shouldnt refresh
[10:12:50] <supsup> i use just return false in .submit() at end.  add console logs in there
[10:12:57] <supsup> to find out if ur even getting inside your submit event
[10:12:59] <ravenzz> ok why if jQuery is loaded this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/dgvB2/
[10:14:13] <faz> i will try that
[10:14:16] <faz> thanks supsup
[10:14:19] <coldboot|mini> Could someone tell me a unique substring near the implementation of jQuery.type() so I can find it in the source? I'm not sure what to grep for.
[10:14:55] <supsup> ravenzz: add comments to it -- it does not work ...in what way?
[10:15:15] <johnkpaul> coldboot|mini: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.type
[10:15:24] <ravenzz> it would be easy if you open up your console
[10:15:26] <ravenzz> anyway
[10:15:29] <coldboot|mini> johnkpaul: fancy!
[10:15:36] <ravenzz> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'getElementById'
[10:15:53] <johnkpaul> coldboot|mini: yeah, taht's damn useful
[10:15:55] <Phoenixz> I have an HTML snippet in which I have to change some <span> texts.. Basically, I do var snippet='<span id="test">somemore code here</span> '; $(snippet).find('test').text('foobar!');  But after I run this, the span text has not changed.. What am I doing wrong?
[10:16:09] <ravenzz> which actually refers to the onclick handler
[10:16:52] <Seubeu> Hi all a quick question about js : What is the equivalent of $MyObject->{EvalAVar} = $value  (From PHP) in Javascript ?
[10:17:40] <johnkpaul> myObject[evalAVar" = value
[10:17:50] <johnkpaul> myObject[evalAVar] = value
[10:18:06] <Seubeu> ok thank you johnkpaul I'll try that
[10:21:44] <supsup> ravenzz i think only document has that method?  since u added modal to body it should be in document no?
[10:22:08] <kyclark> I have a number of <div>s with class="pub_table" and I'm using " $('.pub_table').hide;" to try to hide any that are currently showing, but it isn't working.  Any pointers?
[10:22:31] <supsup> ravenzz: maybe http://jsfiddle.net/dgvB2/1/
[10:22:41] <ravenzz> sorry
[10:22:52] <ravenzz> silly me
[10:22:56] <ravenzz> doc.getElementById('modalClose') worked perfectly
[10:25:25] <kyclark> Oh, hmm, this works: $('.pub_table').toggle(false);
[10:25:30] <kyclark> kbai
[10:25:37] <aqeel> $('.pub_table').hide();
[10:26:57] <aqeel> toggle is if u want to have something to trigger the event of toggle
[10:27:17] <aqeel> say click this toggle that
[10:33:31] <Whirl3d> could someone explain what is happening in jQuery 1.7 source in the genFX function?
[10:33:36] <bakers> is there a way to make the right click "inspect" in firefox launch firebug, instead of the new built in inspector?
[10:35:02] <Phoenixz> I have an HTML snippet in which I have to change some <span> texts.. Basically, I do var snippet='<span id="test">somemore code here</span> '; $(snippet).find('test').text('foobar!');  But after I run this, the span text has not changed.. What am I doing wrong?
[10:35:11] <jpfarias> hey guys
[10:35:29] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: #
[10:35:32] <jpfarias> how do I get if a checkbox is checked or not on 1.7?
[10:35:37] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: test is an id, you need a #
[10:35:55] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: .is(":checked") or .prop("checked") or elem.checked
[10:35:58] <jpfarias> at 1.6 I did $(selector).attr('checked')
[10:36:15] <ajpiano> that changed between 1.5 and 1.6, not 1.6 and 1.7 fwiw
[10:36:21] <jpfarias> oh ok
[10:36:23] <jpfarias> thanks
[10:36:35] <jpfarias> I may have been using 1.5 for a while indeed
[10:37:25] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, could you explain the syntax jQuery.each(fxAttrs.concat.apply([],fxAttrs.slice(0,num)),function(obj[this]=type;});
[10:37:44] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Ah, my bad, I forgot the # in the demo, but in the devel code I do have that.. it returns the correct object, so thats all fine. Point is that if I do .text('foobar') on that, nothing happens...
[10:38:05] <Whirl3d> *,function () {obj[this]=type;});
[10:38:44] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Also a funny detail.. I had <p id='test'>.. I would select on that $(snippet).find('#test') and get no results.. If I would move it in a span like <span id='test'> and do the very same selector, I would get results.. What is that about?
[10:38:49] <jpfarias> and to set it as checked or not should I do .prop('checked', true) or .prop('checked', false)?
[10:39:02] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: you have to check the structure of the jquery object you create with $(str)
[10:39:11] <ajpiano> sometimes you need to .find() to find child elements
[10:39:27] <ajpiano> othertimes you need to .filter() because you are looking to refine the top-level element set
[10:39:32] <ajpiano> jpfarias: yes
[10:39:39] <jpfarias> ajpiano: thanks
[10:40:55] <Eviltwin> I wish there was a shorter term instead of "function" to declare a function in JavaScript
[10:41:01] <Eviltwin> Especially for anonymous functions
[10:41:03] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: it's generating the parameters for the animation
[10:41:17] <Eviltwin> Like Perl's "sub" or Python's "def"
[10:41:23] <Whirl3d> Sure, I understand What it's doing, I just don't get the syntax.
[10:41:34] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply, btw.
[10:41:42] <Eviltwin> I can take a look as well if you want
[10:41:44] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: filter()? I'll check that.. But when to use find() and when to use filter() ?
[10:41:45] <Eviltwin> I just got here though
[10:41:45] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: use your console and break it down
[10:41:50] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: i just described
[10:41:51] <ajpiano> that.
[10:42:04] <Eviltwin> Phoenixz: .filter takes the jQuery object you already have an reduces it
[10:42:20] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: also, $(snippet).find('#test') returns the correct object.. but $(snippet).find('#test').text('blah') does nothing
[10:42:32] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").filter(".bar") matches elements that have classes foo and bar
[10:42:38] <aqeel> $("#id[sippet id need to change]").text([your new text]);
[10:42:43] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: is that element still off the DOM?
[10:42:45] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").find(".bar") matches elements with class bar that are inside elements with class foo
[10:42:52] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: fxAttrs.concat.apply([], fxAttrs.slice( 0, num )) just builds an array
[10:43:27] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Yeah, its just an HTML snippet, not added to DOM yet (I want to fix it before I add it)
[10:43:28] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: in general, someArray.concat.apply( [], someArray ) is a trick to flatten an array with nested arrays into a single array
[10:43:43] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: truth be told i can't really do anything to help you unless i see a live demo of it failng
[10:43:55] <ajpiano> otherwise we're just two guys telling each other stories about computers
[10:44:06] <Whirl3d> I see. That makes a lot of sense. It could also be used to flatten an object into it's properties as well I assume?
[10:44:16] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: objects don't have a concat method :p
[10:44:20] <Eviltwin> Uh...it's an Array method
[10:44:29] <Whirl3d> lol, right. Sorry
[10:44:32] <ajpiano> or a slice method, etc.
[10:44:59] <Whirl3d> so, how is an associative array different from an object...I'll have to look that up. Thanks for the help.
[10:45:11] <Eviltwin> Don't use associative arrays in JavaScript, use objects
[10:45:32] <ajpiano> ?g andrew dupont associative arrays considered harmful

[10:45:45] <MindSpark> hi, I am using jqueryui theme called start. Can someone have a look at http://designopolis.com/newsite/admin.php and tell me why, when the edit button is clicked, the dialog pops up and looks weird, anyone's encountered this problem before?
[10:47:13] <johnkpaul> MindSpark: do you mean the green background on the edit button is wierd?
[10:47:35] <Whirl3d> Got ya. Thanks Eviltwin, ajpiano, I see where fxAttrs is defined. I thought it was an object, but it's just an array of [heightAnimation props],[widthAnimation props], and [opacity].
[10:50:30] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, no, I mean when the button is pressed a dialog pops up and the close button on that dialog behaves in a weird manner and is located in a strange location
[10:52:20] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Here's what's happening in easier to understand pieces: http://jsfiddle.net/WUPG7/
[10:52:27] <johnkpaul> MindSpark: something is up wih the css
[10:53:12] <johnkpaul> MindSpark: I'd try removing all of your custom css
[10:53:17] <aqeel> if not enough romm float drops
[10:53:21] <johnkpaul> and see what it looks like
[10:53:30] <johnkpaul> yeah, or you could just add float right to the anchor
[10:54:29] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, thanks! That makes a lot more sense. I was having a hard time with the .each syntax...I forget that you can use each like: $.each(array,function). I makes much better sense now, thanks.
[10:54:43] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, removed everything, still no luck
[10:55:20] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It's one of those things that will eventually make perfect sense at a glance
[10:55:33] <Whirl3d> Why does jquery use genfx  to get the property array for a "height" animation, for example rather than just defining them explicitly (in the source code where they do common shortcuts)
[10:55:55] <Eviltwin> Saving bytes and centralizing logic
[10:55:57] <johnkpaul> MindSpark: you're missing line 228 of this file
[10:55:58] <johnkpaul> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.17/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:56:02] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, with your gracious help, I'm getting there...
[10:56:05] <johnkpaul> where did you get your css from
[10:56:16] <Whirl3d> ok, cool.
[10:56:35] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, ok, I haven't included this file at all. Thanks, I'll give it a try
[10:56:35] <Eviltwin> If the properties relating to a height animation changed, we'd want to have one place to update
[10:56:48] <johnkpaul> oh no, you don't _ need_ to include that file, but that line should be in whatever theme you're using
[10:57:07] <Eviltwin> Additionally it would waste a lot of bytes to repeat the string paddingBottom a half dozen times
[10:57:11] <Eviltwin> Or more if more animations are added
[10:57:13] <johnkpaul> I mean, using that file and letting the CSS override is fine, but you might be including files a lot of rules that you don't need
[10:57:59] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, ok, can you please tell me how you found out where the problem is?
[10:58:03] <discorpia> anyone have a good tag cloud plugin suggestion?
[10:58:25] <Whirl3d> makes perfect sense. I am trying to extend jquery's shortcuts for sliding to including slideIN and slideOUT (using width, left/right properties) and was trying to mirror the source of slideUp and slideDn..
[10:58:39] <Whirl3d> *to include...
[10:59:09] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure you're not going to be able to use genFx directly
[10:59:35] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I don't have access to fxAttrs either, do I
[11:00:31] <johnkpaul> MindSpark: I used the chrome dev tools (or firebug, doesn't matter) to compare the css rules defined for the anchor tag in  your example, and in the canonical demo at jqueryui.com
[11:00:35] <johnkpaul> and that line was missing
[11:01:00] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/NjrMJ/
[11:01:09] <Eviltwin> Just use the output
[11:01:59] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, you just inspected both elements?
[11:02:30] <Whirl3d> sure, but in writing a plugin, I can't access genFX or fxAttrs without redifining them locally, right? (probably used all kinds of bad context words there)
[11:04:09] <Whirl3d> in other words, the object returned from genfx would include slideLeft, slideRight, slideOut, slideIn and slideToggle would be modified to handle either up/dn or left/right
[11:04:18] <johnkpaul> MindSpark: yeah
[11:04:35] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, the close button only?
[11:04:52] <aqeel> yup u can do that....
[11:04:54] <johnkpaul> well, I checked the edit text first actually
[11:04:56] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Take a look at the object generated here: http://jsfiddle.net/NjrMJ/
[11:04:57] <johnkpaul> thinking that was the problem
[11:05:04] <johnkpaul> but then I saw that it was the same, so I moved to the next element
[11:05:08] <Eviltwin> It shows you exactly what gets passed as options to animate
[11:05:20] <Eviltwin> properties rather
[11:05:31] <aqeel> firefox has builtin inspect element
[11:05:53] <aqeel> i was doing it too...but he got it first
[11:05:57] <MindSpark> johnkpaul, alright, thanks!
[11:06:02] <aqeel> :-)
[11:06:09] <Whirl3d> right, i see that (and thanks), but I need to add a left and right attribute set to fxAttrs
[11:07:33] <Eviltwin> You're not changing fxAttrs
[11:07:44] <Eviltwin> You're producing a new set of animation properties
[11:08:00] <Whirl3d> right, but there is no left in the current fxAttrs
[11:08:04] <Whirl3d> and there is not right
[11:08:24] <Eviltwin> I'd imagine you're going to be setting the same properties for both of your functions, just setting them to different values
[11:08:32] <Eviltwin> So just build one object of properties
[11:08:40] <Eviltwin> Like slideToggle's output but modified
[11:09:17] * Whirl3d looking up toggle, show, and hide
[11:10:51] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[11:11:02] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[11:12:10] <Eviltwin> aqeel: I think he's more interested in the implementation, not the documentation
[11:12:14] <Seubeu> Hi again, thanks for your help johnkpaul but I'm still stuck. I'm sure is not a big deal but I'm on it still too much time :) : http://pastie.org/3382784
[11:12:56] <aqeel> well y reinvet the wheel if it exists
[11:13:24] <johnkpaul> Seubeu: object keys with periods in them need to be quoted
[11:13:31] <johnkpaul> that should be a syntax error if I'm not mistaken
[11:13:41] <Seubeu> yes it is
[11:13:46] <Seubeu> but I can't resolve it
[11:13:58] <johnkpaul> you want the key to be the literal string "myJson.id"?
[11:14:04] <johnkpaul> if so, put quotes around it
[11:14:14] <Seubeu> nope
[11:14:22] <johnkpaul> if you want it to be the value stored in the property myJson.id, then you can't use that syntax
[11:14:34] <Eviltwin> aqeel: He wants a different kind of wheel
[11:14:38] <jqueryKid3543> need help rotating an image of planet earth that fits entire screen width and height
[11:14:39] <Seubeu> I want the value of myJson.id to become a propertie of list
[11:14:51] <johnkpaul> you have to use var data = {};data[myJson.id] = true;
[11:14:59] <johnkpaul> and then $('#myDiv').data('list',data)
[11:15:33] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, when the shortcuts for animation are being defined, there's the line: return (this.animate(props, speed, easing, callback);   where is it getting the values for speed, easing, and  callback?
[11:16:01] <Whirl3d> sorry, I see just below there.
[11:16:13] <Seubeu> yes but each time I'll call $('#myDiv').data('list',data) I'll erase the previous values of 'list' right ?
[11:16:32] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Just above, they're passed in as args
[11:16:39] <jqueryKid3543> anyhelp?
[11:16:49] <jqueryKid3543> need help rotating an image of planet earth that fits entire screen width and height
[11:17:02] <Seubeu> I may try data = $('#myDiv').data('list') but I'm not sure it will work :)
[11:17:04] <xec> jqueryKid3543: what do you have thus far?
[11:17:58] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, are you familiar with the Fuse library for (blush) actionscript 2?
[11:18:32] <jqueryKid3543> was trying to use jQueryRotate plugin, but it takes the image and rotates it based on the width/height it started at
[11:18:45] <jqueryKid3543> but I need it to stretch
[11:19:14] <xec> jqueryKid3543: what is stopping you from stretching it before it rotates
[11:20:21] <aqeel> set width and height with the window.width and height()
[11:20:58] <aqeel> $('#id').height(window.height());
[11:21:10] <xec> aqeel: i'm guessing he doesn't want it elliptical so find the lower of the two first perhaps :)
[11:21:23] <jqueryKid3543> xec, ill be back hold on...
[11:21:48] <aqeel> yup tha must be considered...
[11:23:26] <Discountrobot> on a completely unrelated matter, how the heck do i route something like domain.com/folder to folder.domain.com?
[11:24:04] <xec> Discountrobot: on the server, preferable
[11:24:09] <xec> preferably*
[11:25:11] <Discountrobot> but, what kind of voodoo htaccess do i have to write in order to achieve this?
[11:26:17] <johnkpaul> Discountrobot: I'd ask that in #httpd
[11:26:24] <johnkpaul> they'd help much faser
[11:26:28] <Discountrobot> i'll do
[11:26:28] <johnkpaul> faster
[11:26:58] <xec> there is a mod_rewrite plugin iirc
[11:27:28] <byebyebyezzz> I am using if ( $active == $('#box1-image IMG:first'))  to check for first element
[11:27:31] <byebyebyezzz> but it doesnt work
[11:27:35] <byebyebyezzz> can some1 help me?
[11:27:46] <xec> byebyebyezzz: what is that code supposed to do?
[11:28:14] <byebyebyezzz> I want to check for the first image
[11:28:16] <xec> byebyebyezzz: and in what context? what is $active?
[11:28:18] <byebyebyezzz> in my div
[11:28:31] <byebyebyezzz> I have a div
[11:28:36] <byebyebyezzz> inside div I have bunch of image
[11:28:44] <byebyebyezzz> var $active1 = $('#box1-image IMG.active');
[11:29:02] <byebyebyezzz> $active1 keep track of where the active class is
[11:29:38] <byebyebyezzz> I just want to check if the class active is at the beginning so I can move it to the last image
[11:30:16] <Discountrobot> $('#box1-image img:first').hasClass('active') ?
[11:30:24] <xec> maybe something like $active1.is("img:first-child")
[11:30:35] <byebyebyezzz> I ll try thx
[11:33:08] <byebyebyezzz> the img:first-child work
[11:33:10] <byebyebyezzz> thank you
[11:33:19] <xec> yw
[11:34:19] <byebyebyezzz> so there should be the same one for img:last-child?
[11:35:02] <xec> yes
[11:35:12] <xec> assuming it really is last child you are after
[11:36:14] <xec> byebyebyezzz: http://jsfiddle.net/UH9jz/
[11:38:28] <xec> byebyebyezzz: this is messy, why are you looking for first and last? maybe there is a better way
[11:38:57] <tab1293> im trying to hide a div that is in a container with two floated divs next to each other. when i hide the div on the left the div on the right fills its spot. i want the div on the right to stay in its position. how can i do this?
[11:39:00] <Phoenixz> http://pastebin.com/w5E2TD1V  Why is this not as expected? I would expect to see "aaaaa", but I keep seeing "test".. Isn't .text('aaaaa') supposed to change the text?
[11:39:44] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: because you are performing the entire operation again when you log out the text
[11:39:57] <ajpiano> s is just a string
[11:40:35] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: i imagine this would work better http://pastebin.com/1z6dfdi8
[11:40:42] <tab1293> example can be seen here: http://www.anes.ucla.edu/~tberger/althome.php hover over mission and click history
[11:41:16] <Eviltwin> Phoenixz: Try this: http://pastebin.com/GY6nq1V5
[11:41:41] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Eviltwin: Checking..
[11:42:16] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: the code you have now says "make some elements from this string of html, search those newly created elements, and update the html of one of them.  THEN, create a brand new set of elements from the same original string, and check if the element inside of that second collection magically has had its html changed by manipulating a completely different element"
[11:42:37] <xec> love the explanation, ajpiano
[11:42:42] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: ah, doh! Gottit
[11:42:59] <Phoenixz> Makes sense, should have seen that myself.. thanks!
[11:43:10] <Eviltwin> Yes, yes you should have
[11:43:51] <tab1293> anyone?
[11:44:09] <xec> tab1293: you can try setting visibility to hidden
[11:44:48] <tab1293> im just trying to make it so the "in the news" div doesnt slide over after the main conent is hidden
[11:45:19] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ tab1293
[11:45:19] <bot-t> tab1293, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:45:33] <xec> tab1293: did the visibility trick work?
[11:45:39] <tab1293> i did Eviltwin example can be seen here: http://www.anes.ucla.edu/~tberger/althome.php hover over mission and click history
[11:46:02] <tab1293> xec: what element would you set the visibility to?
[11:46:20] <xec> tab1293: whatever you're hiding
[11:46:31] <xec> tab1293: something like .css("visibility", "hidden") rather than .hide()
[11:46:47] <tab1293> xec: the hiding is working fine, i just want the div next to it to stay in place. i want that slide effect
[11:47:22] <xec> tab1293: make a demo or give us a url like bot-t wants :)
[11:47:22] <tab1293> the end product should have another div sliding into that spot as the old content slides out
[11:47:34] <tab1293> i just did
[11:47:36] <Eviltwin> I see a lot of broken image references here
[11:48:03] <tab1293> Eviltwin: i know, didnt even start that
[11:48:52] <xec> tab1293: you can make a wrapper in the html, just hide the contents and not the entire box
[11:50:54] <tab1293> xec: ok thanks. another question is where should i position the second div that i want to slide in as the content slides out?
[11:51:44] <Jon471> is there some sort of feature detection for ":hover" pseudo-classes?
[11:52:33] <Eviltwin> Not without waiting for the user to trigger a hover, I don't think
[11:53:32] <xec> tab1293: i have no idea - could you make a tiny jsfiddle demonstrating what you're trying to do?
[11:58:54] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ tab1293
[11:58:54] <bot-t> tab1293, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[12:00:26] <xec> tab1293: i would do something like this, if you really want it to take up space after you slide it: http://jsfiddle.net/uywv7/
[12:00:53] <xec> tab1293: i think, however, that this isnt really what you want
[12:01:34] <xec> because, if you now slide something in, this huge box will still be there taking up space ;)
[12:01:52] <tab1293> xec: thank you i can work with that at least. ill try to put up a jfiddle when im done at work
[12:04:35] <Jon471> Eviltwin - ended up using Modernizr feature detection for touch based devices, basically did the same thing as far as i was concerned, thanks for your input!
[12:19:37] <xarxer> Will find() find children that matches selector, or just the first-level children?
[12:19:47] <xarxer> eh
[12:19:58] <xarxer> hmm
[12:20:03] <xarxer> That makes no sense.. :(
[12:21:57] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xDuHM/ for some reason when i load new content into the page and click on that dropdown menu it fires as many times as new content loads.. so if i load new content once and click on the dropdown, the click will fire twice, if i load content twice, it'll load 3 times… i tried doing $(this).closest('.js-drop-nav').delegate('a', 'click', function() {}); in replace of $button.click(function(){});
[12:21:58] <someprimetime> but it didn't work
[12:21:58] <someprimetime> a
[12:22:03] <someprimetime> any ideas?
[12:24:41] <xec> someprimetime: sounds like you attach new handlers every time you load content
[12:24:59] <xec> but the demo doesn't seem to demonstrate the issue?
[12:26:52] <someprimetime> xec, the code is @ the top here which is how i'm loading the content
[12:26:53] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xDuHM/1/
[12:27:29] <someprimetime> i can't really hook it up to jsfiddle, but that's what's loading the new content
[12:27:48] <xec> you can actually make jsfiddle echo back dummy data
[12:28:55] <someprimetime> xec: ah nice did not know i'll look into that
[12:29:35] <xec> i can't tell from just looking at the code what could be causing it
[12:29:51] <someprimetime> k i'll hook it into it
[12:30:00] <someprimetime> yeah it's driving me nuts
[12:33:16] <tab1293> can you stagger events in jquery. ie as an element is sliding out can you have another element slide in?
[12:33:30] <tab1293> while the first element is sliding out?
[12:35:13] <xec> tab1293: sure
[12:35:22] <xec> :)
[12:35:32] <xec> i feel that was a sufficient answer
[12:40:41] <xec> tab1293: i was bored so i made you this http://jsfiddle.net/uywv7/2/
[12:45:28] <Eviltwin> xec: That's pretty much what I do around here :P
[12:45:44] <Eviltwin> "I'm bored so I did that thing you spent 2 weeks working on in about 30 minutes"
[12:46:16] <supsup> anyone know why scrollPosition does not stay constant when i scroll up and down the page?  comment is at point I do not get: http://jsfiddle.net/4WpN7/5/
[12:46:45] <supsup> constant relative to the scroll that is not as a constant always
[12:47:58] <xec> Eviltwin: hehe, i like it, it's a nice hobby ^^
[13:08:33] <intellilogic128>  find(":hidden") what does the ":" mean?
[13:09:03] <BinaryKitten> intellilogic128 it means "this is not a real selector, but a pseudo-selector meaning to do extra stuffs"
[13:10:48] <Eviltwin> intellilogic128: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:21:01] <mllie> If I do: loadLink.before(htmlString); how do I find all ul:s in that htmlString after it is added? Like doing loadLink.prev() and get all after that till loadLink?
[13:22:21] <dabear_> mllie: If I understand your question correctly you want to see ?nextall
[13:22:21] <bot-t> mllie, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[13:23:16] <mllie> dabear_: could I do like saving the prev() before calling before() and then do nextAll().find("ul")?
[13:23:42] <dabear_> mllie: your explanation makes no sense to me
[13:23:59] <dabear_> look at the examples in the link posted above
[13:24:56] <mllie> dabear_: I have <div class="container"><article></article><article></article><article></article><article></article><a class="loadLink"></a></div> and before(html) does input more article-tags before the loadLink. I want to find all ul:s in these newly added article-tags
[13:26:50] <ajmiller82> hi everyone. I need a little guidence. I have a table I'm dynamically deleting rows from, the first column is a rowspan. every time I remove the first row, it breaks my table. is there a nice way i njquery to handle this problem so I dont lose my rowspan?
[13:27:03] <newtonianb> How can I catch QUnit.done from jquery.testHelper.js ?  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/jquery.testHelper.js
[13:27:32] <newtonianb> I tried QUnit.done: function ( failed, passed, total, runtime ) { alert("test"); } but it's giving me "uncaught syntax error"
[13:27:53] <ajpiano> newtonianb: QUnit.done = function(....) { }
[13:28:06] <ajpiano> : is if yr declaring a method on an object literal
[13:28:38] <ajpiano> oh you were trying to add it to the object literal in testhelper
[13:28:47] <newtonianb> I'm trying to catch it, I tried both ways
[13:28:49] <ajpiano> yeah that won't work
[13:28:54] <newtonianb> not sure the syntax how do I do it?
[13:29:24] <ajpiano> if you just put QUnit.done = function(){...} all the way at the bottom, after this object is declared, does that work
[13:30:46] <newtonianb> trying again one sec
[13:31:51] <newtonianb> ajpiano: the problem when it's outside it's telling me QUnit is not defined
[13:32:15] <ajpiano> i don't really know where you're putting it
[13:32:27] <newtonianb> after line 236
[13:32:36] <newtonianb> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/jquery.testHelper.js
[13:32:45] <newtonianb> 237 I mean
[13:33:06] <ajpiano> that's pretty bizaree.. is qunit actually being included
[13:34:31] <newtonianb> ajpiano: it is pretty strange because on line 20 you clearly see QUnit used
[13:34:41] <ajpiano> yeah, my thoughts exactly
[13:34:53] <ajpiano> but that's in a method that's called later
[13:34:54] <JuJuBee> Anyone using the jquery datepick extension?  I cannot get the noWeekends to work
[13:35:00] <ajpiano> not actually being executed immediately after that object is declared
[13:35:07] <newtonianb> ajpiano: I see
[13:35:38] <newtonianb> why can't I defined the QUnit.done behavior inside the asyncLoad: method on line 10
[13:35:59] <newtonianb> jpiano: since a setting gets set i'm assuming a behavior could also be QUnit.config.autostart = false;
[13:36:49] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xDuHM/2/ for some reason when i load new content into the page and click on that dropdown menu it fires as many times as new content loads.. so if i load new content once and click on the dropdown, the click will fire twice, if i load content twice, it'll load 3 times… i tried doing $(this).closest('.js-drop-nav').delegate('a', 'click', function() {}); in replace of $button.click(function(){})
[13:36:49] <someprimetime> but it didn't work
[13:36:56] <newtonianb> ajpiano: since a setting gets set i'm assuming a behavior could also be QUnit.config.autostart = false;
[13:37:32] <ajpiano> newtonianb: just from reading the code my gut instinct is that you would want to set up your done func like, on line 22
[13:37:33] <mllie> dabear_: thanks. works fine
[13:39:17] <newtonianb> ajpiano: ah that worked! much appreciated
[13:39:36] <ajpiano> nice
[13:39:52] <newtonianb> ajpiano: so there is no way to define it lower down there? I was trying to isoalte it since this is part of a repository I want future updates to not conflict so much
[13:40:46] <ajpiano> newtonianb: it seems like qunit is being dynamically included or something here, so you have to wait for it to be finished
[13:41:33] <newtonianb> ajpiano: ah yes it seems to be breaking the flow here
[13:42:06] <MarkvA> Howdy. Amateur question, I know, but I just can't get this darn jQuery ajax function to work: http://pastebin.com/mG7ZaxAd. It's supposed to return the AJAX data (which is the same as the data it sends, I know, but it's just me fiddling around) but it doesn't.
[13:46:56] <MarkvA> the part below the </html> part is the test2.php page btw
[13:48:55] <chovy> xec: how do i echo json w/ jquery on jsfiddle.net?
[13:49:16] <Bennit> Hi
[13:49:40] <ch3mical> echo JSON?
[13:49:41] <Bennit> is there an easy way to get the sibiling from within an element itself?
[13:49:54] <chovy> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/XWUs3/
[13:50:02] <ch3mical> ?closest @ Bennit
[13:50:02] <chovy> just returns an empty object.
[13:50:03] <bot-t> Bennit, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:50:05] <Bennit> there's the prev ~ sibling syntax
[13:50:28] <Bennit> thanks ch3mical , exactly what I need :)
[13:50:32] <ch3mical> ;)
[13:50:43] <Bennit> ~ doesn't work with this, that was my problem :p
[13:51:05] <nitrospectide> If I have a UL for nav, and I want to style the LI before and the LI after the active one (active has class "active") in special ways, how do I select them?
[13:52:27] <supsup> .next .prev?
[13:52:49] <DerekPioneer> i want to have an array sort of thing inside of a cookie, like have a cookie that holds multiple urls that i can read from and add to
[13:52:51] <DerekPioneer> what do?
[13:53:06] <rocky> i'm looking for info on using "templates" of some nature with jquery and the docs say that builtin jquery templates are to be replaced with jsviews ... google isn't showing me much info on jsviews, don't suppose there's an api guide on how to get started with jsviews someplace ?
[13:53:16] <hlve`workaholic> why isn't $(html).css( "background-image","url(/images/background.png)" ); actually working to change the html {background image ?
[13:53:19] <hlve`workaholic> o.O
[13:53:27] <newtonianb> when I overload QUnit.done how can I also tell it to execute the parent.done IE what would have happened if I hadnt overloaded, I have a suspision i'm breaking the flow because it's overloaded elsewhere
[13:53:42] <ajpiano> rocky: eff jsviews
[13:53:44] <newtonianb> this.parent ? or something
[13:53:47] <supsup> think u want quotes around html also most use body instead of html i think
[13:53:50] <ajpiano> use a templating engine that exists now, there are bountiful good ones
[13:54:01] <ajpiano> newtonianb: just alias beforehand
[13:54:10] <hlve`workaholic> So, $("html").css( "background-image","url(/images/background.png)" );
[13:54:10] <hlve`workaholic> ?
[13:54:11] <rocky> ajpiano, any opinion on which one i should get going with? i've not used any of them
[13:54:17] <Bennit> ch3mical: is there a way to do the inverse: the previous element? (.prev uses the matched set, so I don't think that'll work?)
[13:54:18] <supsup> i'd use $("body")
[13:54:19] <ch3mical> ?mdn array.join @ DerekPioneer
[13:54:20] <newtonianb> ajpiano: how do I do that?
[13:54:24] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, .toArray() - Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set, as an array. http://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[13:54:25] <hlve`workaholic> How come body?
[13:54:30] <ch3mical> ?array.join @ DerekPioneer
[13:54:32] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, jQuery.map() - Translate all items in an array or array-like object to another array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[13:54:37] <ajpiano> newtonianb: var oldDone = QUnit.done; QUnit.done = function(a,b,c) { doStuff(); oldDone.call( this ); };
[13:54:40] <ch3mical> wtf
[13:54:55] <ajpiano> rocky: i like handelbars, it works well but some ppl complain its heavy
[13:54:57] <Bennit> like the previous sibling element
[13:55:17] <rocky> ajpiano, thanks, i'll check it out
[13:55:17] <ch3mical> Bennit, .closest will do previous (ancestor) elements
[13:55:46] <ch3mical> handlebars > *
[13:56:13] <hlve`workaholic> Btw, thanks supsup. worked perfectly.
[13:56:25] <supsup> yah i think you can use html also i just always use body
[13:56:34] <rocky> ajpiano, do you know of a jinja-work-alike template thing for jquery?
[13:56:37] <hlve`workaholic> =P Gotcha
[13:56:39] <supsup> not sure why
[13:57:02] <ch3mical> Probably not a sound practice
[13:57:17] <ajpiano> rocky: every template engine that produces a string of html will work perfectly fine with jquery
[13:57:45] <ajpiano> rocky: jquery templates tried to OVER work-alike
[13:57:49] <rocky> ajpiano, jinja2 is django-templates on the serverside... i was just wondering if something similar existed for the browser-side
[13:57:58] <ajpiano> ohhh
[13:58:08] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xDuHM/2/  the infinite scroll demo doesn't work in this fiddle, but for some reason everytime new content loads and i click on $button in the show/hide plugin, it binds the amount of times the content is loaded in
[13:58:10] <rocky> just so i'd be something i'm familiar with :)
[13:58:13] <rocky> *it'd
[13:58:39] <someprimetime> so if i load content in after scrolling 3 panels worth, and click on the dropdown (Popularity V) it'll get triggered 4 times
[13:58:41] <ajpiano> rocky: i am not 100% sure, i think i heard about such a thing, but not sure.
[13:58:49] <someprimetime> once for the initial click and 3 because of the new content that was loaded in
[13:58:51] <ajpiano> client side django templtes that is
[13:58:55] <supsup> hlve'workaholic: because the w3 recommends it! http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html  -- guess thats my new answer to that.
[13:58:58] <ch3mical> Someone know a good/stable Gantt plugin?
[13:59:16] <adoven> rocky: you looking for something like mustachejs? https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[13:59:26] <ch3mical> I'm looking at jQuery.ganttView but now sure how stable it is
[13:59:48] <ch3mical> Also found jquery.gantt but seems maybe still in its infancy?
[14:00:01] <rocky> adoven, no, the syntax is a tiny bit similar but not quite what i was looking for
[14:00:03] <xec> chovy: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[14:00:20] <rocky> ajpiano, right, i'm googling but it's hard to know what to search for since obviously searching "javascript django templates" doesn't yield much ;)
[14:00:41] <ajpiano> if anything it yields too much :p
[14:00:41] <sooperduper> join #html5
[14:00:44] <sooperduper> doh
[14:00:46] <ajpiano> but you can sift through that instead of me
[14:00:48] <ajpiano> :)
[14:00:53] <rocky> hehe
[14:01:21] <rocky> looks like dojox.dtl does it, but i don't know if dojox.dtl is usable outside of dojo proper
[14:01:40] <newtonianb> ajpiano: something funky is happening when I use that alias method, it seems it works fine for the first time around but everytime after it it never uses my custom override
[14:01:55] <ajpiano> hum
[14:02:10] <newtonianb> var oldDone = QUnit.done;  QUnit.done = function(obj) {  alert(obj.failed); oldDone.call( obj ); }
[14:02:22] <ajpiano> newtonianb: what is it you're actually trying to do? if you are trying to enhance or work with the mobile tests, you might want to get input from those cats
[14:02:50] <ajpiano> just have your own QUnit.done in addition to theirs when running the tests?
[14:02:55] <newtonianb> I'm trying to POST the DOM after each QUnit.done of thesetests so I can parse this on the server
[14:03:30] <Dave_Stein> Any idea why only a direct bind would work with this code? http://pastebin.com/F7650xuw
[14:03:36] <Dave_Stein> .on works, .delegate and .live dont
[14:03:40] <chovy> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/XWUs3/2/
[14:03:43] <Dave_Stein> im working on a file that has to be 1.6 compatible
[14:03:51] <chovy> I looked at the docs, but my json is not echoed back.
[14:03:58] <Dave_Stein> works on 1.6 no problem, 1.7.1 hates me
[14:04:15] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: That delegate syntax...is wrong
[14:04:29] <Eviltwin> ?delegate @ Dave_Stein
[14:04:30] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:04:38] <Dave_Stein> d'oh sorry reversed as i typed into pastebin
[14:04:44] <ajpiano> newtonianb: go to #jquerymobile-dev, johnbender is your man
[14:05:24] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/wQL6AVas :D sorry
[14:05:27] <xec> chovy: hrm, ye i cant get it working either now - usually can, and whats odd is all the mootools examples work
[14:05:30] <Dave_Stein> gah
[14:05:34] <Dave_Stein> my brain is scrambled isnt it
[14:05:38] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: How is click involved here?
[14:05:43] <Eviltwin> ?delegate @ Dave_Stein
[14:05:44] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:05:45] <Dave_Stein> no thats me being dumb and scrambled
[14:06:04] <Dave_Stein> my actual line of code in reality is
[14:06:04] <Dave_Stein> $form.delegate( this.css_rule, this.event, configure);
[14:06:16] <Dave_Stein> i just keep fucking up pastebin for no good reason
[14:06:33] <Dave_Stein> http://pastebin.com/UnCkS9k2 sorry I'm being a dumbass right now
[14:06:33] <rocky> ajpiano, don't suppose you have an example of loading a template from another url instead of embedding the html in my javascirpt?
[14:06:55] <newtonianb> ajpiano: where do I go to find these people you think are relevant to this?
[14:07:07] <chovy> xec: i see
[14:07:11] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: I'm definitely using the right arguments in reality, and i just fixed the pastebin to not be so hurried... doign a few things at once
[14:07:15] <ajpiano> rocky: typically the approach there is to use a require system with a text plugin that lets you supply template strings via that
[14:07:30] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: but yeah with the proper arguments on delegate, and live, neither fire, just the .on which is synonmyous with bind is working
[14:07:41] <ajpiano> rocky: for instance, i use requirejs with SlexAxton's handelbars plugin https://github.com/SlexAxton/require-handlebars-plugin
[14:07:49] <Eviltwin> Well we'd appreciate it if you'd put in effort towards the questions asked here
[14:07:50] <ajpiano> so i get templates loaded and compiled by the time i need to use them
[14:08:01] <rocky> ajpiano, gotcha
[14:08:08] <ajpiano> newtonianb: in the #jquerymobile-dev channel
[14:08:22] <SlexAxton> w00t!
[14:08:30] <Eviltwin> You are asking for our time and effort for free
[14:08:48] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: you know I usually do unless you've forgotten me so soon :)
[14:09:05] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: I just make a lot more mistakes when I'm making a fake pastebin vs that actual line i pasted here
[14:09:12] <Eviltwin> Could you make a jsFiddle instead?
[14:09:15] <Eviltwin> So we can actually see it not working?
[14:09:20] <rocky> ajpiano, i was hoping to not have to reach out for even further dependencies but i guess if that's what i need to do
[14:09:33] <ajpiano> rocky: dependency management isn't a dependency :p
[14:09:44] <ajpiano> it's dependency management
[14:09:50] <ajpiano> rocky: there are also simpler approaches
[14:10:05] <ajpiano> rocky: you can write all your templates in separate files and build them together, or write them all in the same file
[14:10:21] <ajpiano> and either way, ajax in that file when your app inits, and process and compile and store the templates somewhere
[14:10:24] <xec> chovy: this works for some reason http://jsfiddle.net/XWUs3/3/
[14:10:32] <danzik17> or compile them on the server and include them as like template.js
[14:11:03] <ajpiano> or that!
[14:11:36] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: sorry coworker was buggin me. I'll do that
[14:12:03] <ch3mical> Damn coworkers
[14:13:20] <rasmusth> http://pastie.org/3383888 shouldnt this work?
[14:14:20] <ajpiano> newtonianb: all good or ... ?
[14:14:25] <brianV> hi all. Just checking something - can only one function be bound to a click() event?
[14:14:31] <Eviltwin> rasmusth: Depends
[14:14:36] <xec> chovy: but it fails if i do a get request or don't json encode it
[14:14:36] <Eviltwin> brianV: No
[14:14:39] <brianV> ie, can there be multiple calls to .click()?
[14:14:39] <Eviltwin> As many as you want
[14:15:18] <brianV> Eviltwin: hmm... ok, thanks. I added another .click() event to a link which only contained an alert() call, and both fail to trigger...
[14:15:39] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle demo of the problem?
[14:15:54] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/cre3J/
[14:16:11] <rasmusth> Eviltwin: okay? :/
[14:16:38] <aaroninfidel> hi there, I was wondering if there was a way to easily get the contents of your newly inserted html from the $('el').before('<p>Stuff</p>');  <-- how can I get a reference to the <p> tag?
[14:16:58] <someprimetime> Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xDuHM/2/  the infinite scroll demo doesn't work in this fiddle, but for some reason everytime new content loads and i click on $button in the show/hide plugin, it binds the amount of times the content is loaded in :o
[14:17:35] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: It would be nice if I can do 1.6.4 on there and check off jquery UI but anyway I can assure you .delegate works no problem on 1.6.4
[14:19:44] <someprimetime> using one() solves it, but i still need to click
[14:19:53] <someprimetime> + it
[14:20:13] <someprimetime> more than once. sorry that was so fragemented let's try over.. i could use one(), but i need to be able to keep clicking it again
[14:20:19] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: I also tried upgrading that plugin from 1.1 to 1.2 but that didn't solve it. it's strange since it runs thru ui widget and it definitely fires the event
[14:20:23] <newtonianb> ajpiano: still trying to maintain normal execution behavior but also append to it my POST, problem is when I overoad that QUnit.done function execution stops so it must be used to loop the process until there are no more tests
[14:20:38] <newtonianb> ajpiano: I tried alias but after the first loop it skips my overload
[14:20:48] <Eviltwin> rasmusth: Make a jsFiddle demo
[14:20:55] <ajpiano> newtonianb: why don't you go to #jquerymobile-dev and talk to the devs, i told them to expect you :)
[14:20:59] <rasmusth> Eviltwin: oki
[14:21:04] <newtonianb> ah! thanks you didn't know of it
[14:21:30] <rasmusth> Eviltwin: http://realen.dk/drupal/payment/?sid=SkkLe250j6eNTxk-Vx41r6RPXW1pD_VH3H3yvoqjfes it's easier if you can just look here maybe?
[14:21:59] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: Any idea why that fiddle I posted wouldn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/cre3J/
[14:22:06] <Eviltwin> rasmusth: Nope, I really don't want to look at that much code
[14:22:26] <rasmusth> okay, but I cannot make a jsfiddle that doesnt work
[14:22:28] <Dave_Stein> Get me the answer and I'll let you win our current game of WWF haha
[14:22:32] <Eviltwin> But submit buttons don't have a submit event
[14:22:34] <Eviltwin> They have a click event
[14:22:37] <Eviltwin> Forms have submit events
[14:22:45] <rasmusth> arhh
[14:23:04] <rasmusth> document ready doesnt work either though
[14:23:16] <Eviltwin> Uh...what?
[14:23:23] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: not sure
[14:23:38] <rasmusth> or I'm wrong
[14:23:54] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: wait
[14:23:56] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: it's weird i don't have any similar bugs with any other plugins so I'd guess it's that version of selectmenu but it definitely is firing frmo within widget
[14:24:05] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: jquery ui 1.8.16 isn't compat with jquery 1.7.1
[14:24:07] <Dave_Stein> using ._trigger and all
[14:24:10] <ajpiano> have you tried 1.8.17
[14:24:10] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/cre3J/10/
[14:24:18] <ayaat> hiiiiiiii
[14:24:27] <ajpiano> and i suepect it's some eventy thing that's the incompatibility
[14:24:56] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: You're probably right then I didn't realize 16 wasn't good with that
[14:24:58] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: also uch, i made that play knowing i'd take a bath on the TW but sheesh, it was meant to balance my rack till i managed to pull TWO H's on the draw.
[14:25:00] <Dave_Stein> I'll go make the change real fast
[14:25:30] <brianV> Eviltwin: can't replicate on fiddle... but I am just now seeing the following in firebug: TypeError: $(".white-paper-download") is null
[14:25:49] <brianV> Eviltwin: I can guarantee there are divs with the class 'white-paper-download' on the page
[14:26:05] <ayaat> ji
[14:26:06] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: When did 17 come out? Sad I missed that :(

[14:27:35] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i hate myself and you're so right - i needed 17
[14:28:45] <tw2113> don't hate yourself
[14:28:49] <tw2113> that's bad for self esteem
[14:30:22] <Dave_Stein> anyway I'm out of here, thanks for help Adam. Hopefully I'll have time to help people in here agian one day. Apartment hunting sucks the life out of ya, that's all I have to say ha
[14:30:23] <Dave_Stein> ttyl
[14:48:51] <someprimetime> why am i getting "methods is not defined"? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/RdpYD/
[14:49:36] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Because you declared methods in a separate scope
[14:50:02] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Here's a step in the right direction: http://jsfiddle.net/RdpYD/1/
[14:50:54] <someprimetime> ahhh
[14:51:11] <someprimetime> thanks Eviltwin
[14:51:15] * tw2113 now sees the difference in append vs appendTo
[14:51:23] <tw2113> and it was a simple misunderstanding on my part
[14:51:24] <Eviltwin> tw2113: Finally :P
[14:51:33] <tw2113> i hang my head in shame
[14:51:42] <Eviltwin> A lot of the functions have two forms like that
[14:52:58] <jeffsmykil> Centering something vertically on the screen when the page is scrolled down
[14:53:20] <Eviltwin> Like fixed center?
[14:53:30] <jeffsmykil> well 40% is always from the top of the page
[14:53:39] <jeffsmykil> I would like from the top of the visible page
[14:54:35] <Discountrobot> does anybody remember that site that gave me jQuery in smaller parts?
[14:54:39] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: did that make any sense?
[14:54:56] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Discountrobot
[14:54:57] <bot-t> Discountrobot, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:54:57] <Eviltwin> That?
[14:55:10] <Eviltwin> Or you mean like where you could download pieces
[14:55:16] <tw2113> mmm MDN
[14:55:21] <Discountrobot> in pieces.
[14:55:31] <Eviltwin> ...
[14:55:48] <Discountrobot> dont give me that, i saw it some days ago.
[14:56:01] <Eviltwin> Do you mean learn it in pieces or download it in pieces?
[14:56:24] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: you are from Ars aren't you?
[14:56:44] <Discountrobot> i want to divide jquery into modules, like Ajax, selectors and animations.
[14:56:52] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I used to be on Ars in #macintosh and #arsificial, yes
[14:57:04] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I used to write for ars
[14:57:19] <Eviltwin> I'm a former coworker of Chris Foresman
[14:57:25] <jeffsmykil> At purdue?
[14:57:35] <someprimetime> any reason why http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/RdpYD/4/  my passed in variables aren't overwriting the defaults with extend()?
[14:57:39] <Eviltwin> It was a short-lived IT job we both had at UChicago
[14:57:41] <LakWork> jquery 1.7 for live equivalent on the body of the page, should i do $(document).on('click', selector, fn) or $('body').on('click', selector, fn) ?
[14:57:53] <Eviltwin> LakWork: Former
[14:57:54] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I too was a co-worker of his, but at Ars
[14:58:06] <LakWork> document is preferable/
[14:58:07] <LakWork> ?
[14:58:36] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: It's because you don't actually know how .apply works
[14:58:43] <Discountrobot> Eviltwin: https://github.com/mythz/jquip
[14:58:58] <Discountrobot> breaks it down into smaller sections.
[14:58:59] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Read this section: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function
[14:59:34] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: so you know clint and jacqui too?
[14:59:39] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/RdpYD/5/
[14:59:51] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I've met them once or twice maybe
[14:59:58] <Eviltwin> Don't really "know" them
[15:02:42] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Was this kind of what you were looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/pGQrN/
[15:02:47] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: are you still a FIB?
[15:03:02] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I figured it out I did some of this var mid = $(window).scrollTop() + Math.floor($(window).height() / 2);
[15:03:17] <Eviltwin> That acronym is escaping me
[15:03:26] <jeffsmykil> Fucking Illinois Bastard
[15:03:30] <Eviltwin> Ha ha ha
[15:03:46] <Eviltwin> Yeah, that's me
[15:03:48] <jeffsmykil> Perhaps you would have got Flatlander
[15:03:53] <jeffsmykil> Are you still a flatlander
[15:03:55] <Eviltwin> I prefer Chicagoan
[15:04:12] <jeffsmykil> the people of Wisconsin prefer FIB
[15:04:40] <numist> is it just me or is the ThemeRoller's image generator effed?
[15:08:27] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: ok, read the article
[15:08:30] <numist> ah, it doesn't understand a three digit colour (expects #rrggbb)
[15:08:44] <someprimetime> so basically i can't access it because i wasn't in the proper function's scope
[15:08:49] <someprimetime> right?
[15:09:18] <someprimetime> since it is only accessible within the expressive function
[15:09:28] <someprimetime> am i understanding that properly?
[15:09:50] <Eviltwin> Your problem is your use of .apply
[15:09:54] <Eviltwin> Focus on the section about that
[15:10:29] <someprimetime> ah ok
[15:11:33] <Eviltwin> If I had to guess you copied that blindly from somewhere
[15:11:40] <Eviltwin> But it's what's causing your problems currently
[15:12:09] <Eviltwin> Rather than fix it for you, I think it's more important that you have some understanding of what you need to do and how to do it
[15:12:12] <Eviltwin> And why it's done that way
[15:12:32] <Eviltwin> The article I sent explains apply and arguments
[15:12:39] <Eviltwin> Please read the details relevant to those
[15:12:50] <someprimetime> well i got it from http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:13:02] <someprimetime> and changed some stuff up in it
[15:13:43] <someprimetime> but yeah i think i understand now.. usingi apply or call from the prototype explicitly sets the initial settings which were the ones defined in my extend, right>
[15:13:47] <someprimetime> ?*
[15:13:50] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Your changes broke it
[15:14:08] <someprimetime> so i need to not use apply in this case?
[15:14:09] <Eviltwin> The code they had would probably have worked fine for you
[15:14:11] <Eviltwin> Why did you change it?
[15:14:19] <someprimetime> because i'm an idiot
[15:14:36] <Eviltwin> You seem to have removed Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 )
[15:14:39] <Eviltwin> Why did you decide to do that?
[15:14:45] <someprimetime> no good reason
[15:14:56] <Eviltwin> Well that's a dangerous reason :P
[15:15:26] <Eviltwin> So if you read that article, you should be able to tell me what .apply does and what arguments means
[15:15:41] <Eviltwin> So what does .apply do
[15:15:44] <Eviltwin> And what does arguments mean?
[15:16:23] <someprimetime> it calls the function with whatever value this is
[15:16:38] <Eviltwin> I mean in general
[15:17:04] <Eviltwin> If I have function foo(x, y, z) { console.log(this, x, y, z); }
[15:17:15] <Eviltwin> And I do foo.apply(document, [1, 2]);
[15:17:20] <Eviltwin> What is the console.log going to log?
[15:17:37] <someprimetime> document and then the array?
[15:17:42] <someprimetime> document object*
[15:17:58] <Eviltwin> It's actually going to be document then 1 then 2 then undefined
[15:18:18] <someprimetime> ah, right because there is no value for z
[15:18:21] <Eviltwin> It takes an array argument that represents the arguments you want to send to the function
[15:18:30] <Eviltwin> What if I do foo.apply(document, [1, 2, 3, 4]);
[15:18:35] <someprimetime> same thing
[15:18:37] <Eviltwin> What is it going to log?
[15:18:39] <someprimetime> document, your array
[15:18:41] <someprimetime> then undefined
[15:18:48] <Eviltwin> No, it's not going to log an array
[15:18:56] <someprimetime> it'll log an object?
[15:19:03] <Eviltwin> Neither of the two applys will log an array
[15:19:15] <Eviltwin> I'm pretty sure this was explained in the article
[15:19:49] <Eviltwin> Maybe not
[15:19:58] <Eviltwin> Let me explain it another way
[15:20:29] <Eviltwin> Let's start with var x = $("<div>");
[15:20:44] <someprimetime> ok
[15:21:01] <Eviltwin> Doing x.css("display", "none") is the same as x.css.apply(x, ["display", "none"])
[15:21:16] <Eviltwin> Doing x.css("display") is the same as x.css.apply(x, ["display"])
[15:21:29] <Eviltwin> Note that it's not the same as x.css(["display", "none"])
[15:21:39] <Eviltwin> Or x.css(["display"])
[15:21:43] <someprimetime> ahh ok
[15:21:48] <someprimetime> i think i'm understanding
[15:21:53] <someprimetime> you explicitly define what goes into x
[15:21:57] <someprimetime> after it
[15:21:57] <Eviltwin> So you can send a variable number of arguments to the function this way
[15:22:10] <Eviltwin> You don't need to know ahead of time how many there are
[15:22:26] <Eviltwin> Now inside my function
[15:22:32] <Eviltwin> function foo(x, y, z) { ... }
[15:22:46] <Eviltwin> I only name my first three arguments
[15:22:53] <ajpiano> someprimetime: http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/ is useful as well, unless you already saw that
[15:23:09] <someprimetime> thanks ajpiano ++
[15:23:13] <LZNPDE> is there any good way to work with css properties such as '0px 0px' i'm splitting with a ' ' and trimming of the 'px' at the moment, but what happens if the values aren't in px?
[15:23:44] <Eviltwin> If I called foo(1, 2, 3, 4)
[15:23:56] <Eviltwin> Inside the function x would be 1, y would be 2, and z would be 3
[15:24:18] <Eviltwin> In order to access the 4
[15:24:19] <someprimetime> right
[15:24:22] <Eviltwin> Or accept a variable number of arguments
[15:24:26] <Eviltwin> You can use the keyword "arguments"
[15:24:29] <chrisdev> Anyone know if JQuery 1.7 is OK to use with PhoneGap 1.4.1?
[15:24:40] <Eviltwin> It's an array-like object that represents a list of all the arguments sent to the function
[15:24:47] <someprimetime> ah, interesting
[15:24:49] <someprimetime> never knew you could do that
[15:24:50] <Eviltwin> arguments would effectively be [1,2,3,4] in this case
[15:24:57] <someprimetime> so it's an optional parameter
[15:24:59] <someprimetime> but still accessible
[15:25:00] <someprimetime> if i need it
[15:25:12] <yamahaalex37> this statement is not working as planned
[15:25:13] <yamahaalex37> $('#content').html("<?php include('create-db.php'); ?>");
[15:25:15] <Eviltwin> Now do you know what [1,2,3,4].slice(1) would do?
[15:25:39] <someprimetime> yamahaalex37: you are injecting php code in with javascript which would need the intepreter to run
[15:25:55] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Open your document and do View Source
[15:26:04] <yamahaalex37> when i view source, its shown as a comment
[15:26:12] <yamahaalex37> <!--?php include('create-db.php'); ?-->
[15:26:32] <someprimetime> slice(1) would get rid of 2
[15:26:36] <intellilogic128> yamahaalex37: if that worked that way, you could hack any website...
[15:26:39] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Nope
[15:26:40] <someprimetime> so you'd be sending in 1,3,4
[15:26:45] <someprimetime> o.o
[15:26:50] <Eviltwin> That's not what slice does
[15:26:56] <yamahaalex37> intellilogic128, how can i go about this?
[15:26:57] <Eviltwin> slice returns a range of elements in the array
[15:27:09] <Eviltwin> If it's just one parameter, it starts at that index and goes to the end
[15:27:14] <Eviltwin> So it will return [2,3,4]
[15:27:16] <intellilogic128> yamahaalex37: PHP RUNS and then puts out HTML, you need to do some ajax to get the page
[15:27:23] <someprimetime> so it'd return 3, 4
[15:27:26] <someprimetime> woops
[15:27:32] <someprimetime> ah so it starts at 1?
[15:27:36] <someprimetime> not 0?
[15:27:39] <someprimetime> (index, that is)
[15:27:43] <Eviltwin> .slice(0) is the whole list
[15:27:58] <Eviltwin> It's inclusive
[15:28:05] <Eviltwin> It includes that index
[15:28:08] <someprimetime> oh
[15:28:35] <yamahaalex37> intellilogic128, if I just put that include in the index, it would work fine
[15:28:37] <Eviltwin> So Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ) is a way to use .slices on arguments instead of a normal array
[15:28:42] <yamahaalex37> what harm is there in javascript putting it in?
[15:28:42] <ajpiano> someprimetime: when you see .slice(0), on an array, typically it's used to copy an array by value instead of by reference
[15:28:56] <Eviltwin> Meaning it's going to produce an array of all but the first argument
[15:29:13] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Let's step through the logic for $.fn.tooltip here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:29:40] <intellilogic128> yamahaalex37: one sec, writing you code
[15:29:54] <yamahaalex37> thank you intellilogic128
[15:29:59] <Eviltwin> Assuming you do .tooltip("show", "name", "Bob");
[15:30:16] <Eviltwin> Inside the function(method) { ... })
[15:30:22] <Eviltwin> method will be "show"
[15:30:32] <Eviltwin> It will test methods[method] and find that such a method exists
[15:30:37] <intellilogic128> yamahaalex37: $.ajax({url:"create-db.php", error:function(){console.log("error");}, success:function(responseHTML){ $('#content').html(responseHTML) } });
[15:30:39] <Eviltwin> Then it's going to do http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:30:44] <Eviltwin> Producing ["name", "Bob"]
[15:30:59] <Eviltwin> Then it's going to apply those arguments to methods[method] preserving "this"
[15:31:18] <Eviltwin> So in the end the show method will be called with "this" being the jQuery object it was called on and "name" and "Bob" as its two arguments
[15:31:25] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[15:31:38] <someprimetime> all the way up until preserving "this"
[15:31:38] <Eviltwin> In your code, you dropped the argument splicing
[15:31:40] <someprimetime> what do you mean by that?
[15:31:49] <Eviltwin> return methods[ method ].apply( this, Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ));
[15:32:08] <Eviltwin> It means that when it runs "this" inside show will be the same as whatever "this" was inside $.fn.tooltip
[15:32:11] <Eviltwin> Which would be the jQuery object
[15:32:16] <Eviltwin> That it was called on
[15:32:25] <someprimetime> ahhh wow ok
[15:32:31] <someprimetime> hell yeah
[15:32:37] <someprimetime> thanks for explaining that
[15:32:43] <someprimetime> i'm pretty sure i get it now
[15:32:44] <Eviltwin> So when you dropped the Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ) part
[15:32:46] <someprimetime> ask me a question
[15:32:47] <intellilogic128> yamahaalex37:  you want anything to do with php after the page is loaded, the only was is going to be ajax.  responseHTML is going to be whatever the result of your page is, even if there is no text, it will have ran that PHP page.
[15:32:49] <yamahaalex37> thanks intellilogic128 i really apprecaite that
[15:32:56] <Eviltwin> You effectively made it so that no arguments got passed to any of those methods
[15:32:58] <someprimetime> i wasn't looking for anything after the first argument
[15:33:01] <someprimetime> right
[15:33:27] <Eviltwin> But it meant that those methods received 0 arguments
[15:33:27] <intellilogic128> yamahaalex37:  :)
[15:33:56] <Eviltwin> So here's a question
[15:33:57] <Eviltwin> ?hard
[15:33:57] <bot-t> var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[15:34:03] <Eviltwin> What does w equal after this?
[15:35:20] <someprimetime> the next id?
[15:35:35] <someprimetime> in the document object
[15:35:43] <someprimetime> wait no
[15:35:48] <Eviltwin> Well what does this[y](z) equate to in this case?
[15:36:00] <Eviltwin> When it runs here
[15:36:17] <Eviltwin> Piece by piece
[15:36:22] <Eviltwin> What is "this" what is "y" and what is "z"
[15:36:28] <Eviltwin> When that .apply happens
[15:36:42] <someprimetime> document is [y] right?
[15:36:55] <Eviltwin> Nope
[15:37:02] <Eviltwin> Remember what the first argument of .apply represents
[15:37:09] <Eviltwin> The first argument to apply rather
[15:37:41] <someprimetime> it represents this
[15:37:45] <nFFF> returns an array of elements on the page?
[15:37:58] <Eviltwin> So what's "this" inside the function?
[15:38:05] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Nope
[15:38:09] <nFFF> specifically foo
[15:38:32] <nFFF> is it not the exact same as $('#foo') ???
[15:38:38] <Eviltwin> No, it is not
[15:38:53] <Eviltwin> It's similar but different
[15:39:10] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: So what's "this" inside the function?
[15:39:16] <Eviltwin> Inside "x" when the apply runs
[15:39:33] <nFFF> an object of the DOM
[15:39:35] <Eviltwin> You're basically said all of the pieces
[15:39:36] <someprimetime> it's the document object
[15:39:39] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:39:45] <Eviltwin> Okay, now what does y get set to
[15:39:57] <fructose> Does jQuery have any tricks for 'scaling' an entire div?
[15:39:57] <someprimetime> foo?
[15:39:58] <nFFF> #foo
[15:40:00] <Eviltwin> No
[15:40:06] <someprimetime> :|
[15:40:12] <nFFF> It grabs the objec of id foo?
[15:40:17] <someprimetime> nFFF: ++
[15:40:19] <Eviltwin> ?hard
[15:40:19] <bot-t> var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[15:40:34] <Eviltwin> y is the first argument to x
[15:40:41] <karnei> Are things feeling down today? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPAJ9I7AIAs
[15:40:49] <Eviltwin> How are arguments set when using .apply?
[15:40:55] <nFFF> object, array
[15:41:02] <someprimetime> yes
[15:41:05] <someprimetime> what nFFF said
[15:41:16] <nFFF> ok
[15:41:17] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: So what are the arguments to x in this case?
[15:41:20] <nFFF> i feel you
[15:41:32] <someprimetime> y, which is the array
[15:41:32] <nFFF> this[document,foo]
[15:41:33] <Eviltwin> What values do they have as a result of the apply
[15:41:47] <Eviltwin> This was the point I was trying to make earlier
[15:42:12] <Eviltwin> x.apply(this, ["foo", "bar"]) doesn't mean x(["foo", "bar"])
[15:42:16] <Eviltwin> What does it mean?
[15:42:23] <karnei> fun.apply(thisArg[, argsArray])
[15:42:35] <tw2113> so in genera, it's better to use $('#id').find('.class') instead of $('#id .class') for performance?
[15:42:41] <tw2113> general*
[15:42:42] <nFFF> it means, apply to object this, elements foo and bar
[15:42:57] <someprimetime> yes.. it's always the object and then the array
[15:42:58] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: What would be the equivalent x(...) way of calling it
[15:42:58] <nFFF> or simply the array that contains foo and bar
[15:42:58] <dinduks> Hi guys, how can I pass a parameter to the $.ajax function? Thanks
[15:43:03] <someprimetime> but we didn't splice it though, right?
[15:43:06] <chovy>           section.fadeOut(function(){
[15:43:06] <chovy>             section.remove();
[15:43:07] <chovy>           });
[15:43:10] <Eviltwin> There's no splice involved here
[15:43:21] <chovy> is there a better way to write that. like section.fadeOut().remove()?
[15:43:23] <someprimetime> how come the one before needed a splice then
[15:43:33] <chovy> not s ure if remove() will fire after fadeOut is done though.
[15:43:34] <Eviltwin> Because we were trying to accomplish a different task
[15:43:47] <nFFF> this.getElementById[foo,bar]?
[15:43:52] <Eviltwin> Maybe I should ask this the other way around first
[15:43:54] <karnei> dinduks - good question,
[15:44:01] <someprimetime> this is set to document
[15:44:08] <Emn1ty> anyone willing to help out with some ajax stuff? not very proficient at it and not sure what parts of the syntax I can modify. Essentially I just want to send a post request to a php file, run a script that modifies the data I get and return the data into two seperate sections of the page (a form of dropdowns and a product listing)
[15:44:26] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: How would I do document.getElementsByClassName("myClass") using document.getElementsByClassName.apply(...)
[15:44:27] <nFFF> woah I get it
[15:44:29] <karnei> dinduk what kind of variable are you trying to pass
[15:44:31] <Eviltwin> What would the ... need to be?
[15:44:58] <nFFF> var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]); // y = the array of dom objects
[15:45:04] <nFFF> this is the document
[15:45:05] <dinduks> karnei: A simple string, which is outside $.ajax's scope, and thus is undefined inside of it
[15:45:14] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Incorrect
[15:45:18] <yamahaalex37> how can i include a long block of code in jquery.html(code here)
[15:45:21] <yamahaalex37> like muiltiple lines
[15:45:24] <karnei> dinduk you can make global variable
[15:45:46] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Do you have a guess at least?
[15:46:02] <dinduks> karnei: How do you suggest doing that?
[15:46:04] <someprimetime> function x(y)
[15:46:04] <someprimetime> return this[y](z); var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementByClassName"]);
[15:46:04] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: document.getElementsByClassName.apply(...) fill in the ... so it does the same thing as document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")
[15:46:06] <someprimetime> or whatever :o
[15:46:16] <someprimetime> elements, rather
[15:46:33] <someprimetime> man i need to step my straight js game up
[15:46:36] <Eviltwin> Just answer this question first
[15:46:42] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: document.getElementsByClassName.apply(...) fill in the ... so it does the same thing as document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")
[15:46:52] <karnei> what kind of variable are you trying to pass, im assuming to success function for .ajax
[15:47:08] <nFFF> document.getElementsByClassName.apply(document,'myClass')
[15:47:24] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Close but incorrect
[15:47:35] <dinduks> karnei: Not for the success, but for data
[15:47:42] <nFFF> document.getElementsByClassName.apply(this,'myClass')
[15:47:43] <dinduks> karnei: i'll gist you that
[15:47:48] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Less correct
[15:47:54] <someprimetime> var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementsByClassName', 'myClass')
[15:48:01] <nFFF> fuark ims tarting to guess :|
[15:48:06] <someprimetime> bracket around getelementsbyclassName
[15:48:14] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: There's no x involved in this sub question
[15:48:14] <dinduks> karnei: i'll gist you that
[15:48:16] <someprimetime> haha
[15:48:18] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: document.getElementsByClassName.apply(...) fill in the ... so it does the same thing as document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")
[15:48:24] <dinduks> karnei: sorry, here it is https://gist.github.com/1831743
[15:48:27] <someprimetime> sorry i was editing the other one in a text file because it's formatted
[15:48:44] <Eviltwin> nFFF is at least answering the right question
[15:48:48] <Eviltwin> He's just answering wrong
[15:49:07] <someprimetime> document.getElementsByClassName.apply('myClass')?
[15:49:25] <someprimetime> document.getElementsByClassName.apply(document,'myClass')
[15:49:26] <Eviltwin> What were we talking about earlier with setting the "this"
[15:49:33] <Eviltwin> Okay, now that's close, that's what nFFF had
[15:49:49] <Eviltwin> But remember how .apply takes an array?
[15:49:56] <dougb> I'm trying to get something to happen after a delay after an element is clicked, I did a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/yMCax/  I think I am close...does anyone have suggestions?
[15:50:00] <nFFF> it takes an objec and an array
[15:50:00] <yamahaalex37> is + on each line the best way to include multiple lines?
[15:50:08] <Eviltwin> "myClass" isn't an array
[15:50:12] <Eviltwin> It's a string
[15:50:21] <nFFF> fuck
[15:50:26] <someprimetime> document.getElementsByClassName.apply(document, ['myClass'])
[15:50:32] <nFFF> document.getElementsByClassName.apply(document,new Arrat('myClass'))
[15:50:33] <Eviltwin> Correct
[15:50:39] <Eviltwin> nFFF: someprimetime's was better
[15:50:40] <someprimetime> woot
[15:50:44] <Eviltwin> So
[15:50:45] <someprimetime> nFFF: :P
[15:50:47] <Eviltwin> The important detail
[15:50:50] <karnei> right so... the server wouldnt read it?
[15:50:51] <nFFF> :<<<
[15:50:54] <someprimetime> lol
[15:51:00] <someprimetime> <3
[15:51:02] <Eviltwin> Is that despite the fact that we're passing an array to .apply there
[15:51:11] <Eviltwin> getElementsByClassName IS NOT receiving an array
[15:51:23] <Eviltwin> It's receiving one argument, the string "myClass"
[15:51:29] <nFFF> Yes
[15:51:33] <Eviltwin> Is that clear, someprimetime?
[15:51:39] <someprimetime> yep
[15:51:43] <Eviltwin> So now let's see ?hard
[15:51:44] <bot-t> var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[15:51:45] <someprimetime> it won;t work unless it's an array
[15:51:50] <Eviltwin> What is x receiving?
[15:51:55] <Eviltwin> What arguments
[15:52:02] <Eviltwin> What is "y" going to be
[15:52:03] <someprimetime> x is receiving document and the array
[15:52:15] <dougb> nvm, got it working.  I was using the wrong function
[15:52:20] <Eviltwin> We've established that "this" will be document
[15:52:21] <nFFF> var z = "foo"; function x(["getElementById"]) { return this[["getElementById"]]('foo'); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[15:52:22] <Eviltwin> That's correct
[15:52:24] <Eviltwin> but what is "y" going to be
[15:52:30] <nFFF> this = document
[15:52:42] <karnei> or it should fail
[15:52:46] <someprimetime> y will be getElementByID
[15:52:49] <karnei> because its converted to string
[15:52:49] <someprimetime> right?
[15:52:52] <Eviltwin> The string
[15:52:56] <Eviltwin> "getElementById"
[15:53:02] <dinduks> karnei: Nevermind, it's data.value that is undefined... Damn me. Thanks man
[15:53:02] <nFFF> document["getElementById"]('foo');
[15:53:04] <Eviltwin> It's not an array, it's not a function
[15:53:06] <Eviltwin> It's a string
[15:53:11] <Eviltwin> And what's z going to be?
[15:53:22] <yamahaalex37> can I include an entire html file with $('#id').html(include file.html) ?
[15:53:35] <Apathetic> does obfuscating the jquery code make it slower?
[15:53:35] <someprimetime> food
[15:53:37] <someprimetime> err foo
[15:53:40] <koden> hey all, so I am trying to take a form field and once the user is done filling it out another form field will be injected with that data right afterwards. No clicking or anything just as soon as field1 is done and moved out of field2 is injected
[15:53:53] <nFFF> How is document["getElementById"]('foo'); different from $('#foo');
[15:53:54] <someprimetime> this["getElementById"]('foo')
[15:53:57] <Apathetic> I was looking over here, http://www.jquery4u.com/security/hide-jquery-source-code/
[15:54:04] <Eviltwin> Substitute "this" as well
[15:54:04] <Apathetic> and wondering if there are disadvantages of it
[15:54:22] <jacof> Hi guys. A little question. How to select every child but one from a certain element?
[15:54:29] <someprimetime> ?easy
[15:54:29] <Eviltwin> jacof: see ?not
[15:54:31] <bot-t> jacof, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:54:32] <bot-t> someprimetime, Tutorials:Zebra Striping Made Easy - Walking through the simple code needed to stripe table rows. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Zebra_Striping_Made_Easy
[15:54:36] <someprimetime> woops
[15:54:42] <someprimetime> ;)
[15:54:45] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You said this["getElementById"]('foo')
[15:54:50] <Eviltwin> Remember that we know what "this" will be set to
[15:54:53] <nFFF> document["getElementById"]('foo');
[15:54:58] <jacof> maybe: .children(:not(.classname)) ?
[15:55:00] <someprimetime> document.getElementById('foo')
[15:55:04] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:55:18] <Eviltwin> This call will return the result of document.getElementById('foo')
[15:55:25] <Eviltwin> And it will be saved in "w"
[15:55:26] <karnei> hey Guys, I have a question
[15:55:32] <someprimetime> so that's what javascript does everytime you call that native selector
[15:55:32] <nFFF> Eviltwin
[15:55:41] * Nomikos wonders whatever happened to $('#foo')
[15:55:45] <nFFF> So how is that different then $('#foo') educate me
[15:55:52] <nFFF> I said that right at the begginig
[15:55:54] <someprimetime> $('#foo') is jquery
[15:55:58] <someprimetime> this is just pure js, i believe
[15:55:58] <karnei> how do you get a queue to run a function when its done
[15:56:03] <someprimetime> but it does the same thing
[15:56:09] <karnei> specifically ajaxqueue
[15:56:27] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Try document.getElementById("foo").innerHTML vs $("#foo").innerHTML
[15:56:35] <nFFF> But I was pretty much right
[15:56:38] <Eviltwin> Or $("#foo").html() vs document.getElementById("foo").html()
[15:56:40] <nFFF> Could have told me that :|
[15:56:46] <nFFF> feel like Ive been misleaded
[15:56:50] <nFFF> and abused
[15:56:52] <nFFF> but ti was fun
[15:56:53] <someprimetime> nFFF: you got it before me
[15:56:54] <nFFF> give us another one
[15:56:57] <someprimetime> quit your whining :P
[15:57:01] <someprimetime> lol
[15:57:01] <karnei> lol misleaded
[15:57:07] <Eviltwin> Well there's a pretty critical difference between $("#foo") and document.getElementById("foo")
[15:57:13] <Eviltwin> And that is 22kb of JavaScript
[15:57:14] <someprimetime> he meant unleaded
[15:57:16] <someprimetime> he's a machine
[15:57:18] <Nomikos> heh
[15:57:21] <someprimetime> running on high octane fumes
[15:57:21] <karnei> as in deprived of your vitality?
[15:57:32] <Eviltwin> 22kb of JavaScript we call jQuery
[15:57:37] <someprimetime> which dissipate from Eviltwin
[15:58:03] <Emn1ty> anyone willing to help out with some ajax stuff? not very proficient at it and not sure what parts of the syntax I can modify. Essentially I just want to send a post request to a php file, run a script that modifies the data I get and return the data into two seperate sections of the page (a form of dropdowns and a product listing).
[15:58:08] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks for the explanation
[15:58:09] <someprimetime> that was fun
[15:58:12] <someprimetime> always a good time learning from you
[15:58:25] <Eviltwin> I need to start charging for these lessons
[15:58:31] <Eviltwin> They're time-consuming for me as well
[15:58:37] <someprimetime> psh you know you love it
[15:58:39] <Nomikos> and dedicate a channel to 'm :p
[15:58:44] <someprimetime> if you weren't doing this what else would you be doing?
[15:58:58] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: yeah man, that was incredible, you are a fine fine person
[15:59:02] <Eviltwin> The work I actually need to get done
[15:59:03] <ajpiano> #js
[15:59:10] <someprimetime> that's actually an interesting business model… when people ask you questions start explaining and then give them a bill afterwards.. i like it
[15:59:16] <tw2113> he'd probably be getting laid by some lonely single girl this holiday
[15:59:22] <Eviltwin> Well you can feel free to donate to me here: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[15:59:28] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Thanks
[15:59:37] <jacof> Can't tell if quiet ... or disconnected -.-
[15:59:46] <someprimetime> i'll donate when i get my next paycheck you know i'm good for it
[16:00:12] <tw2113> nice goal total Eviltwin
[16:00:25] <Eviltwin> tw2113: It demanded a goal so I went a little optimistic
[16:00:52] <tw2113> i should do that for #wordpress
[16:00:55] <tw2113> :D
[16:00:57] <koden> nvm guys I figured it out on my own. Good old keyup method :D
[16:01:05] <jacof> :not seems to be the answer, but it isn't working so good so far.
[16:01:11] <karnei> somehow i dont see "Hey Baby I know jQuery" as yet having hit the bar market
[16:01:36] <nFFF> Eviltwin what you do for living
[16:01:53] <dinduks> How to access the 'label' property in Object { label="Megadeth", value="Megadeth"}?
[16:01:55] <karnei> so Emn1ty im not sure how I can help, but have you tried tutorials?
[16:02:21] <Emn1ty> I've found one tutorial for php+jquery $post but it says very very very little
[16:02:36] <Emn1ty> as in, its explanations are go to jquery.com
[16:02:54] <Eviltwin> nFFF: JavaScript & jQuery :P
[16:03:01] <karnei> http://www.degraeve.com/reference/simple-ajax-example.php
[16:03:20] * tw2113 is working to move from server side to client side with stuff
[16:04:02] <karnei> right so... in php
[16:04:07] <karnei> its different right :)
[16:04:38] <karnei> ....thinks (im useless) :(
[16:04:42] <Emn1ty> The logic is probably the same
[16:04:47] <Emn1ty> just different syntax
[16:04:52] <karnei> right
[16:05:28] <Emn1ty> i have an innate problem with things that don't explain every nook and cranny of what's going on in relatively basic terms.
[16:05:51] <karnei> but what I havent figured out yet is how to run a singular function after the very last ajax loaded document is loaded or (success/complete)
[16:06:56] <karnei> so jquery makes all that easy
[16:06:57] <karnei> $.ajax({
[16:06:57] <karnei>   url: "test.html",
[16:06:57] <karnei>   context: document.body,
[16:06:57] <karnei>   success: function(){
[16:06:57] <karnei>     $(this).addClass("done");
[16:06:58] <karnei>   }
[16:07:24] <Emn1ty> yeah, i was reading the article on their site
[16:07:46] <dinduks> Can you please tell me how to access the 'label' property in Object { label="Megadeth", value="Megadeth"}? var.label says it's undefined
[16:07:47] <Emn1ty> what I want to know is how to pass back specific information via php
[16:07:50] <karnei> error(), .success(), and .complete
[16:08:05] <dinduks> Emn1ty: where to?
[16:08:42] <Emn1ty> ajax call script.php and have it return info from the .php
[16:08:46] <karnei> isnt it  { label:"Megadeth", value:"Megadeth"}?
[16:09:01] <Emn1ty> yes
[16:09:04] <karnei> emn1ty : yup
[16:09:25] <dinduks> Emn1ty: echo json_encode($myData);
[16:09:36] <karnei> so var newObject = Object {label:"MD",...;  newObject.label
[16:09:42] <Emn1ty> tried that, but i'll look at it again
[16:10:29] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: another i need to understand more is currying so i'll focus on those
[16:10:39] <dinduks> karnei: this object is returned by an api, I cannot change it, I just want to access its properties
[16:13:01] <karnei> you mean data: json_encode(_myData)  should work
[16:14:19] <dinduks> karnei: who are you talking to? ;P
[16:14:28] <karnei> any one with ajaxQueue experience?
[16:14:32] <BinaryKitten> dinduks: if you are seing Object ..... and using php
[16:14:44] <Eviltwin> karnei: I've implemented queues for AJAX before but never used ajaxQueue
[16:14:45] <BinaryKitten> then it's not outputting correctly
[16:15:08] <dinduks> BinaryKitten: I'm not using php, and I don't have the control over this object :/
[16:15:15] <karnei> Eviltwin its all good, I just dont get how to run a last call function
[16:15:15] <BinaryKitten> right
[16:15:23] <BinaryKitten> dinduks that's fine
[16:15:49] <BinaryKitten> but what is outputting the item, and how is it outputted?
[16:16:06] <karnei> Eviltwin I dont have to use ajaxQueue
[16:16:09] <nFFF> Eviltwin can you no go work for google or something/
[16:16:13] <nFFF> Or maybe mozilla
[16:16:16] <nFFF> :>>
[16:16:49] <nFFF> And give me another task
[16:16:55] <nFFF> I like things like that
[16:17:06] <dinduks> well... it's returned by a Rails gem (kind of library). The object concerned is data: https://gist.github.com/1831743
[16:17:32] <dinduks> damn!!
[16:17:49] <dinduks> I can access it using "data.item.data", what the hell is that...
[16:17:56] <dinduks> data.item.label* sorry
[16:18:03] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Don't have time to build a puzzle but read up on http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ and be able to tell me why and how they were used
[16:18:30] <BinaryKitten> dinduks thanks for that pastebin, but that's not the outputted data
[16:18:48] <dinduks> BinaryKitten what do you mean?
[16:19:13] <BinaryKitten> you pastebinned your code, not the data that you get back.
[16:19:22] <BinaryKitten> .
[16:19:52] <BinaryKitten> anyway, seems you have it sorted now
[16:19:59] <Emn1ty> so the issue I am running into is that when i send a request to the page and try to include my functions.php file. Currently I am using a file which filters my inventory to display my inventory. I am also externally including a file that has all my prewritten functions.
[16:20:00] <dinduks> Or sorry, I thought you saw it already
[16:20:14] <dinduks> BinaryKitten: Object { label="Megadeth", value="Megadeth"}
[16:20:23] <BinaryKitten> that's not data as output
[16:20:29] <BinaryKitten> what's that taken from?
[16:20:51] <Emn1ty> but when i send the request to my inventory filtering file, i get an error that my includes are not there (despite putting it in an if statment to be included when the post exists).
[16:21:00] <Emn1ty> the data returns, but the include doesn't register.
[16:21:23] <Emn1ty> So echo "hello" is displayed, but include('function.php"); directly after it isn't working
[16:21:35] <BinaryKitten> Emn1ty if a php file doesn't include, that's not JS/jQuery
[16:21:43] <Emn1ty> alright
[16:21:53] <BinaryKitten> can't really provide you with php support sorry
[16:22:02] <BinaryKitten> you might get better help over in ##php
[16:22:14] <nFFF> Eviltwin, I actually don't see the immediate value
[16:22:17] <dinduks> BinaryKitten: Sorry but I don't get what you mean. Thanks anyway the problem is solved ^^
[16:22:22] <nFFF> They allow your to defer callbacks
[16:22:37] <nFFF> But why not have all your code in the first success: callback for instance
[16:22:39] <BinaryKitten> small question dinduks .. where did you get Object { label="Megadeth", value="Megadeth"} from?
[16:22:49] <nFFF> why do you need multiple callbacks
[16:23:00] <nFFF> except maybe for asynch requests
[16:23:07] <dinduks> BinaryKitten: I said that it is returned by an external library
[16:23:08] <nFFF> where they are completed at different times
[16:23:44] <BinaryKitten> dinduks that precise line of data?
[16:23:55] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Explain why synchronous AJAX is or isn't a bad idea.
[16:24:09] <Eviltwin> Depending on your views
[16:24:22] <Eviltwin> And if you don't have any views, Google "synchronous AJAX" and look around
[16:24:28] <Eviltwin> Or I think there's a blurb on see ?ajax
[16:24:28] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:24:53] <dinduks> BinaryKitten: Which line? :/ I don't understand
[16:24:55] <nFFF> Bad idea: you don't know the queue in which they are completed
[16:25:14] <BinaryKitten> Object { label="Megadeth", value="Megadeth"}     <--- that precise line that 100% precise data as that in that format
[16:25:20] <nFFF> Good idea: performance/speed gains, more requests at once
[16:26:12] <nFFF> oh synchronous
[16:26:19] <Eviltwin> Yes
[16:26:24] <nFFF> inverse of what I said
[16:26:26] <nFFF> :P
[16:26:28] <Eviltwin> Why is synch bad?
[16:27:05] <nFFF> resources?
[16:27:14] <Eviltwin> How so?
[16:27:15] <Eviltwin> Explain
[16:27:20] <BinaryKitten> uses no more resources that asych nFFF
[16:27:34] <nFFF> Im thinking on the multithread capabilities of browsers perhaps
[16:27:50] <BinaryKitten> actually, it would technically use less since no other resources until it returns
[16:27:53] <blindMoe> tw2113: still around?
[16:28:08] <nFFF> Ok why is it bad :<
[16:28:09] <Eviltwin> How many threads does JavaScript have available to it?
[16:28:11] <tw2113> yeah, i'm still logged on IRC
[16:28:24] <someprimetime> can i not do var blah = 5; $(this).eq(blah)?
[16:28:27] <blindMoe> tw2113: that template based on any kind of grid system by any chance?
[16:28:34] <someprimetime> does it need some sort of conversion?
[16:28:37] <tw2113> nope
[16:28:38] <someprimetime> seems it only takes just a number
[16:28:44] <blindMoe> k thanks
[16:28:50] <BinaryKitten> dinduks in the end, Object { label="Megadeth", value="Megadeth"}  is not Json, it's not xml, it's in a strange format that wouldn't normally be parsed. The only place i've seen that is when someone uses console.log
[16:29:04] <nFFF> no idea Eviltwin :<
[16:29:10] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Only one
[16:29:16] <nFFF> so in synchronous
[16:29:16] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Only one function is running at a time in JavaScript
[16:29:24] <Eviltwin> So what happens in synchronous
[16:29:34] <Eviltwin> If the request say takes 5 seconds to complete
[16:29:36] <nFFF> everything stops
[16:29:40] <nFFF> until completed
[16:29:41] <dinduks> BinaryKitten: I actually got it from console.log, maybe that's why it's "weird". Does console.log change the data format?
[16:29:45] <Eviltwin> Correct, JavaScript can't do anything till it's done
[16:29:53] <BinaryKitten> dinduks yes it does
[16:30:05] <BinaryKitten> it outputs in a human readable way
[16:30:22] <dinduks> I see, thanks a lot for the explanations. :) I'll keep that in mind
[16:30:29] <dinduks> What do you suggest to "watch" my variables?
[16:30:41] <BinaryKitten> dinduks to give the best answers we would have neede the RAW data from the external library
[16:30:44] <Eviltwin> dinduks: A loud dog
[16:30:52] <BinaryKitten> but watching vars in firebug is a good thing to do..
[16:30:56] <nFFF> Man can't believe I only started to learn javscript/jquery  a month a go to remove a class now im up till 1am trying problems :|
[16:31:03] <BinaryKitten> but it doesn't help us help you debug :)
[16:31:04] <nFFF> new i shouldn start programming
[16:31:08] <nFFF> should have left it to the devs
[16:31:14] <dinduks> nFFF: welcome to the club ;)
[16:31:34] <BinaryKitten> nFFF wait til you learn about dependency injection
[16:31:37] <dinduks> Eviltwin: hm?
[16:31:44] <nFFF> I don't need to know any of this though
[16:31:50] <nFFF> it doens't effect my job ha
[16:31:54] <Eviltwin> dinduks: I thought you meant so that no one steals them
[16:31:54] <nFFF> :|
[16:31:56] <someprimetime> console.log($(this).find('li:eq("+options.wrapAfter+")')); is that not the proper way to do this?
[16:32:08] <dinduks> Eviltwin hehe :D
[16:32:12] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime probably not
[16:32:13] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Use .eq(...) instead
[16:32:15] <Eviltwin> It's safer
[16:32:27] <Eviltwin> You get no benefit from the pseudo selector
[16:32:31] <BinaryKitten> what is options.wrapAfter someprimetime?
[16:32:41] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: a variable 5
[16:32:52] <nFFF> Ok thanks for the fun this evening
[16:32:53] <nFFF> bed time
[16:32:58] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Good night
[16:32:58] <BinaryKitten> yeah, use the .wq
[16:32:59] <someprimetime> console.log($(this).find('li').eq("+options.wrapAfter+") won't work either.. hm
[16:33:11] <Eviltwin> Why do you have "+...+" there?
[16:33:17] <Eviltwin> It take a number...
[16:33:20] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: per this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1074728/jquery-pass-variable-to-eq-does-not-work
[16:33:21] <Eviltwin> takes*
[16:33:25] <BinaryKitten> $(this).find('li').eq(options.wrapAfter);
[16:33:41] <Eviltwin> There's a difference between :eq and .eq
[16:33:45] <Eviltwin> see ?:eq see ?.eq
[16:33:45] <bot-t> :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[16:33:46] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[16:33:52] <Eviltwin> Read both of those pages please
[16:33:58] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: woops i forgot to mention
[16:34:02] <someprimetime> since this is a zero based index selector
[16:34:07] <someprimetime> the number i'm passing in is 5
[16:34:11] <someprimetime> and if i pass it to this
[16:34:15] <someprimetime> it'll select the 6th element instead
[16:34:22] <BinaryKitten> $(this).find('li').eq(options.wrapAfter-1);
[16:34:26] <someprimetime> so i set var wrapAfter = options.wrapAfter + 1
[16:34:26] <Eviltwin> If only JavaScript could add and subtract numbers
[16:34:31] <someprimetime> :o
[16:34:33] <someprimetime> lol
[16:34:50] <someprimetime> -1 i meant
[16:35:01] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime remember ALL js arrays are 0 indexed
[16:35:31] <someprimetime> ah got it now
[16:35:35] <someprimetime> freaking extra '
[16:35:37] <BinaryKitten> if it has a textual key or doesn't start at 0, it's an object pretending to be an array
[16:35:47] <someprimetime> thanks BinaryKitten
[16:35:48] <someprimetime> and Eviltwin
[16:36:04] <Nomikos> That has to be the most confusing thing about Javascript for PHP devs
[16:36:28] <Nomikos> (*one of the most confusing things)
[16:36:44] <BinaryKitten> Nomikos yep
[16:37:01] <BinaryKitten> Nomikos even worse is that PHP 5.4 gets the [] syntax for arrays
[16:37:36] <BinaryKitten> eg in PHP5.4 you can do $myArray = ['A'=>'B', 'C'=>'D'];
[16:38:02] <Nomikos> wow :) that's not how I imagined it would have been applied..
[16:38:07] <BinaryKitten> which I personally like
[16:38:20] <Eviltwin> Typing array(...) is hard
[16:38:25] <BinaryKitten> Nomikos it will also have the [1,2,3,4,'B']
[16:38:38] <BinaryKitten> but basically [] = array( )
[16:38:38] <Nomikos> hmkay
[16:38:46] <BinaryKitten> in 5.4
[16:41:30] <ProLoser|Work> anyone work with chosen?
[16:42:37] <Guest23550> When using sortable, is there any way to get the old and new position?
[16:42:44] <Guest23550> Positon within a list, that is.
[16:44:21] <aaroninfidel> anyone know a good place to learn HTML/CSS?
[16:44:51] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
[16:48:17] <someprimetime> i'm using nextAll() to get a bunch of elements and I want to wrap all of them with a div, but it's wrapping each element
[16:48:30] <someprimetime> instead of wrapping around all elements e.g.
[16:48:50] <ajpiano> ?wrapAll
[16:48:51] <bot-t> .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[16:48:52] <BinaryKitten> ?.wrapAll @ someprimetime
[16:48:53] <bot-t> someprimetime, .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[16:48:58] <someprimetime> <div><li></li><li></li><li></li></div> is what i want <div><li></li></div><div><li></li></div> is what it's doing
[16:49:01] <someprimetime> oh wow
[16:49:02] <someprimetime> thanks
[16:49:03] <someprimetime> :)
[16:49:05] * BinaryKitten hi5s ajpiano
[16:49:18] <ajpiano> :D
[16:49:25] <chee> :D
[16:49:29] <someprimetime> it lives!

[16:49:31] <someprimetime> B)
[16:57:07] <koden> hey all, is there a way to have a dialog pop up from another dialog?
[16:58:43] <koden> man this channel died
[16:58:55] <Emn1ty> what kind of pop up?
[16:59:00] <Emn1ty> like an alert?
[16:59:00] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/VFthffas – question, I get the data.result in my log, but "Funkar" doesn't show up, I have no idea why it doesn't proceed, help?
[16:59:21] <someprimetime> koden: you mean to update the contents within your modal?
[16:59:24] <koden> they would be two jquery ui dialogs
[16:59:48] <someprimetime> what is the use case for this?
[17:00:21] <Emn1ty> I don't see why not
[17:00:42] <koden> basically we have a table of values that are saved in a jquery ui dialog. you can delete items from this table but the delete link should open a confirm pop up before moving forward
[17:00:59] <donCams> hello
[17:01:01] <koden> not saved, poor word, displayed in a table
[17:01:17] <Emn1ty> you can do an $(item).click(alert(are you sure?));
[17:01:34] <Emn1ty> to put it simply
[17:01:35] <donCams> or do some fancy lightbox popup
[17:01:39] <Emn1ty> yeah
[17:01:43] <Nomikos> qom2: try jQuery(data.result).each(function () {
[17:01:43] <donCams> -grin-
[17:01:49] <koden> except that after the confirmation it needs to pass ajax
[17:01:54] <Emn1ty> as long as it isn't an alert box it should be very simple to do
[17:02:07] <Emn1ty> thats fine
[17:02:10] <donCams> yeah. don't use alert or confirm :3
[17:02:39] <qom2> Nomikos: oh, thanks!
[17:02:40] <qom2> :)
[17:03:12] <donCams> koden, on confirm, do some ajax magic
[17:03:31] <koden> ok thanks guys, I'll look into using a confirm :D
[17:03:40] <donCams> wtf :(
[17:03:49] <Emn1ty> don't use a confirm
[17:04:11] <Emn1ty> make a confirmation window that returns a confirmation to perform the script
[17:04:29] <Emn1ty> it'll look prettier
[17:04:47] <Emn1ty> :)
[17:06:46] <Guest23550> When using sortable, is there any way to get the old and new position?
[17:06:48] <Guest23550> Positon within a list, that is.
[17:07:24] <Guest23550> Oh, nobody knows?
[17:07:27] <ajpiano> Guest23550:
[17:07:31] <Guest23550> You must all be noobs!
[17:08:02] <chovy> w/ a nick like Guest23550 I wonder who the real noob is.
[17:08:14] <Nomikos> You can sort with jQuery?
[17:08:20] <Nomikos> Whoa
[17:08:24] <Emn1ty> I'd say you could 1) save the positions to an array or b) check to see if sortable keeps their original index on the element.
[17:08:30] <ajpiano> in the various appropriate sortable events, get the ui.item's index
[17:08:35] <ajpiano> with see ?index
[17:08:35] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[17:08:50] <Guest23550> Ah ok cool thanks
[17:08:57] <Guest23550> And Emn1ty Sure.. I suppose I could do that too :s
[17:09:12] <Guest23550> chovy: It's a cool name.. Guests are cool.
[17:11:43] <koden> thanks guys that worked. I'd still like to see two jquery dialogs one open in the other at some point but the confirm works for now
[17:12:03] <ajpiano> koden: you can obviously have multiple jquery ui dialogs open at a time if you want
[17:12:14] <ajpiano> the idea that one would physically contain the other is nonsensical though
[17:12:43] <koden> not what I meant, I meant open one from the other
[17:12:47] <ajpiano> the second dialog doesn't have to actually be inside of the dom tree of the first one to physically appear as though it's over it...
[17:12:51] <koden> which I tried to do and it doesnt seem to work for me
[17:12:55] <ajpiano> ok well yes, that's emininently possible
[17:13:36] <koden> do you have a tut on how to do that ajpiano I am quite curious
[17:14:17] <ajpiano> gimme a min
[17:14:29] <xboi209> Hey guys I need help with the :contains selector, I only find examples where if jquery can find a certain word, then it could do css stuff like changing background colors but how do I execute variables?
[17:15:22] <Eviltwin> Execute variables?
[17:15:48] <xboi209> yes
[17:15:53] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[17:16:44] <xboi209> like here's the example I see on w3schools: $("p:contains(is)").css("background-color","red");                  when you see the .css, I want to replace that and execute a vriable
[17:17:37] <koden> xboi209 we don't exactly know what you mean by "execute a variable" what do you mean by the term "execute"
[17:17:53] <xboi209> use the variable
[17:17:55] <xboi209> ._.
[17:17:58] <coldhead> evaluate?
[17:18:10] <xboi209> like if I had var hi = ("Hello");
[17:18:21] <xboi209> I want to use var hi
[17:18:48] <koden> well you can "use" a variable in many different ways, do you mean "display" the variable
[17:18:55] <xboi209> umm yes
[17:19:55] <koden> xboi209 this might help a bit http://api.jquery.com/html/
[17:20:54] <koden> so basically you would have an empty div in your html that you can inject into using that method.
[17:21:47] <xboi209> What if I still wanted to use the :contains, what it still be possible to achieve what I'm trying to do?
[17:23:15] <Briareos1> is there a simple way to say: focus on the next (in regards to the source code) input element of class 'example' - WITHOUT going up the hierarchy first?
[17:24:05] <Nomikos> I /think/ .next('.example') does that
[17:24:13] <xboi209> Koden?
[17:24:16] <ajpiano> koden: http://jsfiddle.net/QZL5f/
[17:24:37] <koden> xboi209 yeah you can still use contains
[17:24:54] <Nomikos> Briareos1: ehr, nextAll('.example')
[17:25:08] <xboi209> how would I replace the .css and display a variable then
[17:25:21] <Vorspire> ?siblings
[17:25:22] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[17:26:18] <Briareos1> Nomikos: unfort. not ...
[17:26:22] <dzajdband> it fails if "this" is the last .example item
[17:26:26] <xboi209> Koden?
[17:26:43] <Nomikos> Briareos1: not nextAll either? then I don't think I understand the question
[17:26:49] <koden> I'm doing a jsfiddle for you hold on xboi209
[17:26:51] <dzajdband> but maybe is what you want
[17:26:54] <xboi209> ok
[17:26:58] <Briareos1> structure: <td><form><INPUT class="current"> </...> <td><form><INPUT class="example"> </...>
[17:27:10] <koden> xboi209 http://jsfiddle.net/CUtYA/     does that make sense?
[17:27:17] <Nomikos> .... Ah.
[17:27:50] <Nomikos> That's not exactly without going up the hierarchy first, IMO
[17:28:08] <xboi209> Koden that doesn't work because the contains doesn't check if there's a word "is"
[17:28:25] <Briareos1> Nomikos: i meant there IS an hierarchy, but I want to avoid having to traverse it :)
[17:29:03] <xboi209> or
[17:29:10] <xboi209> let me check that again koden
[17:29:13] <Nomikos> Hm-mm. Can you tweak the selector so it finds all the relevant inputs, and then runs through those?
[17:29:46] <koden> xboi209 I updated http://jsfiddle.net/CUtYA/2/
[17:29:47] <Nomikos> 'td form input[class=example]' or something similar
[17:29:59] <Briareos1> how'd i get there in the simplest manner? i mean stepping manually causes a lot of effort if for example an enclosing diff is added
[17:30:08] <Briareos1> => bad maintainability
[17:30:12] <ajpiano> koden: did you see the fiddle..
[17:30:19] <koden> xboi209 notice how I have two paragraphs, one has the word is in it. so that is being replaced by the var that I defined
[17:30:24] <xboi209> ahh
[17:30:34] <koden> I did ajpiano, thank you very much, sorry I was trying to help out xboi
[17:30:46] <xboi209> Koden is there any way for it to not replace the paragraph?
[17:31:05] <xboi209> or wait
[17:31:10] <Briareos1> Nomikos: there's a lot of "example" class input elements actually
[17:31:10] <xboi209> hmm
[17:31:12] <Briareos1> <form><INPUT class="example"> </...> <form><INPUT class="example"> </...> <form><INPUT class="example"> </...> <form><INPUT class="example"> </...> <form><INPUT class="example"> </...>
[17:31:13] <Briareos1> :)
[17:31:15] <xboi209> ya..
[17:31:30] <Nomikos> Briareos1: and you need to only find the ones /after/ the currently selected one?
[17:31:46] <Briareos1> and i _always_ just need to go to the next one ...
[17:31:52] <Briareos1> yep
[17:32:07] <Nomikos> Good one :)
[17:32:10] <xboi209> Hey koden, why did you add in the div tags?
[17:32:20] <koden> xboi209 use .after in stead http://jsfiddle.net/CUtYA/4/
[17:32:48] <Briareos1> i recently had something ugly like that: .closest('td').next().next().find('.example').focus()
[17:32:56] <Briareos1> ... but it failed anyways
[17:33:42] <chovy> lets say i have a collection of <li>'s how do I filter the list do only get those <li>'s with a class of .foo ?
[17:33:53] <chovy> to only get*
[17:34:31] <Briareos1> Vorspire: is there a way that allows siblings to work in my case?
[17:34:39] <koden> xboi209 you good to go?
[17:34:47] <someprimetime> xboi209 are you from stockton?
[17:34:50] <xboi209> Why did you add in the div tags though?
[17:35:04] <xboi209> yes
[17:35:07] <koden> idk cause I wanted to
[17:35:08] <someprimetime> ha! i grew up there.
[17:35:18] <koden> not required
[17:35:27] <xboi209> oh
[17:35:28] <xboi209> ok
[17:35:56] <someprimetime> chovy: wrap them inside a div and do $('div').find('li').hasClass('foo')
[17:36:19] <someprimetime> or you might want each() instead
[17:36:34] <chovy> someprimetime: i thought there was a .filter()
[17:36:36] <someprimetime> xboi209: do you go to school out there?
[17:36:44] <xboi209> yes
[17:37:03] <Nomikos> Briareos1: if you could find the index of the current input in all of $('input.example'), you'd just have to add 1
[17:37:13] <xboi209> When did you grow up there?
[17:37:15] <someprimetime> word. i graduated from uop
[17:37:28] <dzajdband> that was my snippet
[17:37:32] <chovy> someprimetime:       var ebooks = this.$books.filter('.ebook');
[17:37:32] <dzajdband> did it work?
[17:37:33] <someprimetime> up until a few years ago so i've lived there maybe 22 years (i'm 25)
[17:37:43] <xboi209> dang
[17:37:51] <xboi209> what high school did you go?
[17:37:53] <someprimetime> st. mary's
[17:37:56] <xboi209> oh
[17:38:04] <xboi209> is that like near the library?
[17:38:11] <someprimetime> it's on el dorado
[17:38:13] <someprimetime> by alberto's
[17:38:16] <xboi209> oh
[17:38:26] <xboi209> anyways im in mcnair right now
[17:38:30] <someprimetime> you from there?
[17:39:25] <Nomikos> Briareos1: I think you want set.index(currentElement)
[17:40:19] <Nomikos> which should return an int, add 1, use .. appropriately, somehow
[17:40:59] <someprimetime> Nomikos: there are no ints in js
[17:41:03] <someprimetime> only 64 bit floats
[17:42:08] <Nomikos> hm, does that also apply to character positions within strings, like indexOf() would return
[17:42:13] <dzajdband> does my code works? $('.example').eq($(this).index('.example')+1);
[17:42:23] <tyfighter> anyone know of a way to one-time prevent the loading dialog from appearing w/ jQuery Mobile?
[17:42:28] <Nomikos> In any case, it'll return a number which you can add 1 to, to find the next item
[17:42:53] <dzajdband> tyfighter .one?
[17:43:20] <tyfighter> dzajdband: it is automatically handled by the framework when changing pages..
[17:43:44] <binil> tyfighter: $.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg()
[17:44:04] <tyfighter> yes but that doesn't prevent it from loading, only hides it when it's there
[17:45:06] <izepstan> hello there, it's noone in the js room, if someone could give me a hint how to assign these key to obj, if( value in objName ) { ObjName.value=kompkomp.value+1; }
[17:45:36] <binil> tyfighter: you can hijack that method and provide a custom implementation. chk this out: https://gist.github.com/1100435
[17:45:40] <izepstan> this makes the key of the obj objName['value']
[17:47:11] <tyfighter> binil: thx
[17:53:16] <binil> tyfighter: simpler way would be to set $.mobile.loadingMessage = false
[17:53:44] <binil> check out the code(	// loading div which appears during Ajax requests
[17:53:44] <binil> 	// will not appear if $.mobile.loadingMessage is false)
[17:53:53] <tw2113> does the bot have a built-in command to point people to plugin authoring?
[17:54:28] <tw2113> if so, could someone use it on me? :D
[17:56:13] <Briareos1> Nomikos: i am unable to find anything about "set" in the reference- what is it?
[17:57:37] <Briareos1> hmm i suppose you mean a set of objects ?
[17:57:46] <Nomikos> Briareos1: ehr, yes, sorry
[17:58:45] <Briareos1> Nomikos: that would be $('.try').index() i suppose (try == example)
[17:58:46] <Nomikos> and then you could use .eq(index+1)
[17:59:18] <Nomikos> you have to pass the current element to index() as well, so it knows which index/key to return
[17:59:44] <Briareos1> ah ok
[18:00:17] <Nomikos> cur = $(this); next = $('.example').eq($('.example').index($(this))+1); // bit crude and untested, but ...
[18:00:33] <Nomikos> ahd I totally failed to actually use cur, there.
[18:01:56] <Briareos1> puh i wonder what's best practice to go abt such a problem - i have it in each and every project (where no predictable IDs are available) ...
[18:03:07] <Nomikos> hm, quick test, it does work :)
[18:04:15] <Briareos1> really? not here ...
[18:04:19] <Briareos1>   next = $('.try').eq( $('.try').index( $(this) ) + 1 )
[18:04:19] <Briareos1>   $(next).focus()
[18:04:51] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/gfQEb/
[18:04:56] <Nomikos> Briareos1: ^
[18:05:28] <Nomikos> I think you can do plain next.focus() since next is already a jquery object
[18:08:17] <Briareos1> Nomikos: strange - that also fails for me ... maybe b/c i am using classes instead of elements (as you example does)
[18:08:29] <Briareos1> at least that's the only difference code wise
[18:08:37] <Nomikos> hm. /me fiddles
[18:10:29] <Briareos1> Nomikos: stop. i got it :)
[18:10:31] <Nomikos> this looks a bit cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/gfQEb/2/
[18:10:34] <Nomikos> oh, ok :-)
[18:10:54] <Nomikos> Hammertime?
[18:10:57] <Briareos1> Nomikos: my $(this) was not really a this ... cuz i was in no event like click
[18:11:27] <Nomikos> ah, right.. yeah code examples have to simplify things sometimes :)
[18:11:55] <Briareos1> so i exchanged the this for the id (juhu i got an id for that) and now it works
[18:12:00] <Briareos1> thanks a lot!
[18:12:09] <Nomikos> nice, np :)
[18:12:26] <Nomikos> good fun & I learned another bit of jquery again..
[18:14:49] <coloso> How can I list other channels?
[18:14:59] <thang> lolwut
[18:15:08] <coloso> how can i list all available channels?
[18:15:09] <hobs> dont do it
[18:15:18] <hobs> its bad news bears on an irc server generally
[18:15:26] <thang>  /list
[18:15:35] <hobs> you can just /list but if you have a sane irc client it will be like DONT DO IT
[18:15:35] <coloso> thank you thang
[18:15:37] <Nomikos> Doesn't freenode have a list online somewhere?
[18:15:59] <hobs> well time you stuff your tubes
[18:16:11] <hobs> get all those delicious channels in there
[18:16:23] <Nomikos> http://irc.netsplit.de/channels/?net=freenode
[18:16:51] <hobs> and youll probably notice thousands of channels, unless you grep them or something it will be useless
[18:16:55] <hobs> oh yeah, look at that
[18:16:58] <hobs> 11335 channels in the list
[18:17:04] <hobs> good thing you have a list in your client hehe
[18:18:34] <zophy> can .load() load an http://.... url ?
[18:18:44] <zophy> a remote file ?
[18:19:06] <coloso> sick with schizophrenia and I don't understand minute 2:15 on this youtube vid f6HGS0O9yEg Do your good deed of the day please help.
[18:19:24] <Nomikos> zophy: Ajax has issues in general with files that sit on other servers
[18:20:45] <zophy> Nomikos, yeah, i had this working once.. now it;s borked
[18:21:13] <Nomikos> zophy: you can look into jsonp if you can control that other server, or if that server supports it
[18:23:14] <Corey> coloso: Please don't spam users or channels on freenode.
[18:35:03] <dunkel2> hello!
[18:35:21] <dunkel2> when it is recommended to use the live()
[18:35:28] <coldhead> ah dunkel, you're one of my favourite beers
[18:35:34] <dunkel2> and when to keep using the on()
[18:35:38] <coldhead> you should not use it anymore, dunkel2
[18:35:38] <dunkel2> lololol
[18:35:43] <dunkel2> really?
[18:35:44] <coldhead> live is deprecated
[18:35:47] <coldhead> on() is the future
[18:35:49] <dunkel2> im watching some video tutorials
[18:35:56] <dunkel2> from net tutsplus
[18:36:00] <coldhead> they do the same thing internally
[18:36:04] <coldhead> but on is neater
[18:36:05] <Nomikos> .on() as off jQuery 1.7 I believe
[18:36:13] <coldhead> and live() will get retired eventually
[18:36:17] <dunkel2> and the guys says that live will always be added to new dom automatically
[18:36:31] <coldhead> so will on
[18:36:36] <dunkel2> really?
[18:36:46] <dunkel2> so for exmaple if i have an on method on something
[18:36:51] <coldhead> live is just on with the parent of document
[18:36:55] <dunkel2> and if i load a new content using ajax
[18:37:02] <coldhead> you can rewrite any live() in on() form
[18:37:05] <coldhead> and it will work
[18:37:07] <dunkel2> the new elements will ahve that event?
[18:37:13] <coldhead> yes
[18:37:16] <dunkel2> ;O
[18:37:16] <Nomikos> Note there's a slight difference in that you give .on() a root element (in the selector) *and* a target element for the event
[18:37:23] <coldhead> if you do on() right
[18:37:29] <dunkel2> then i have some duplicated stuff on my code
[18:37:49] <dunkel2> how is a on method done right?
[18:38:57] <dunkel2> for example when i select something in a menu, i ask for the $(selecto).on('click',function(){});
[18:39:05] <dunkel2> after the ajax succesfully loads
[18:39:15] <binil> dunkel2:  http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[18:39:24] <dunkel2> then if i click again on that menu i do the same again
[18:39:34] <dunkel2> because i remove all that content
[18:39:39] <Nomikos> .live() only took a selector and watched out for that, with .on() the selector has to exist always, and the target is specified inside, you could do $('#mainArea').on('click', 'div', function() {...
[18:39:59] <imsky> tuuuuesday
[18:39:59] <bot-t> (53 hours 6 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky first week was awesome, as maddening as CSS can make me. :D
[18:40:02] <dunkel2> and load it again , is that correct? or i should just call the on once and it will be attached to my selector if it just pops on the screen
[18:40:17] <Nomikos> does that make sense?
[18:41:04] <coldhead> you should only need to call it once, dunkel2
[18:41:19] <dunkel2> so that way Nomikos, the on() will be listening when in the #mainArea, a div is clicked?
[18:41:24] <coldhead> if you have to call it everytime you migth as well use bind()
[18:41:37] <Nomikos> dunkel2: yes.
[18:41:51] <Nomikos> dunkel2: and yes, also for dynamically added divs
[18:42:09] <dunkel2> i see, then i need to optimize a lot my code :)
[18:42:30] <Nomikos> hrm.. now that you mention it...
[18:42:38] * Nomikos curses under his breath
[18:42:58] <Nomikos> Maybe I shouldn't have always just linked to the "latest" jQuery..
[18:43:12] <dunkel2> thank you guys!
[18:43:43] <coldhead> good luck dunkel2!
[18:43:48] <coldhead> you wonderful beer you
[18:44:06] <Nomikos> ^
[19:10:42] <jcp_> i have a preloaded that keeps freezing because i'm loading too much data (using .load()). How do I avoid this?
[19:15:58] <jcp_> nm i see why
[19:19:06] <xarxer> Can one use a jQuery object together with other selectors?
[19:20:44] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that
[19:22:23] <xarxer> For example if I pass a jQuery object to a function, like function formOk($myForm) { ... }, and I want to check all the <input> and <textarea> in that form.
[19:22:51] <xarxer> Something like: $($myForm + " input, " + $myform + " textarea").each(function() {  ...  });
[19:22:57] <Eviltwin> see ?find
[19:22:57] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:23:07] <ajpiano> xarxer: see ?concatobj
[19:23:07] <bot-t> xarxer, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[19:23:20] <ajpiano> same basically applies to a jquery obj
[19:23:29] <xarxer> hmm
[19:24:02] <ajpiano> myForm.find(*input, textarea")
[19:24:18] <xarxer> If my structure is <form> <div><input /></div>  </form>, will $("form").find('input') reurn all the inputs despite that they're deeper in?
[19:24:57] <ajpiano> yes
[19:25:15] <xarxer> Sweet :)
[19:25:19] <xarxer> Thanks for the help!
[19:27:50] <xarxer> And also, given the previous mentioned structure, how would I find the form-object from the input-object?
[19:27:55] <xarxer> .parent().parent()?
[19:28:36] <ajpiano> .closest("form")
[19:28:50] <xarxer> Thanks again :)
[19:29:51] <ajpiano> :)
[19:30:14] <chee> :)
[19:30:40] <Eviltwin> xarxer: Might be worthwhile to read the links we direct at you
[19:30:54] <Eviltwin> That behavior for .find is described clearly on that API page
[19:32:12] <xarxer> Eviltwin: Yeah, I had totally missed that.. My apologies..
[19:43:40] <dunkel2> if when an animation is complete, i want to call a method can i just do this
[19:43:49] <dunkel2> complete: mymethod(arg1,arg2)
[19:46:23] <Nomikos> dunkel2: the animate() method accepts a callback function which will run on completion
[19:46:50] <dunkel2> should i call my method on that call back function?
[19:47:10] <dunkel2> like that or i need to do complete: function(){ mymethod(a1,a2)}
[19:47:43] <Nomikos> yeah, the latter - otherwise it will execute immediately, to supply the animate() method with a value as a parameter
[19:48:10] <Nomikos> animate({properties}, 3000, function() {mymethod(args, ..)} )
[19:48:58] <Nomikos> dunkel2: if your mymethod callback doesn't take any arguments, you can also just use the function name, without the () at the end
[19:49:12] <Nomikos> so: animate({properties}, 3000, mymethod )
[19:49:23] <dunkel2> ty, it takes arguments, that was the reason of my doubt ;D
[19:49:27] <dunkel2> thank you again
[19:49:33] <Nomikos> ok :)
[19:55:24] <Nomikos> Hm, animating border color still has issues
[19:56:55] <Eviltwin> Do you have the animate color plugin?
[19:57:24] <Nomikos> Hmno, but I now remember that there was a workaround plugin indeed..
[19:57:48] <Eviltwin> Well it's not really a workaround...
[19:58:12] <Nomikos> for this particular issue it could be viewed as one
[20:04:29] <dunkel2> can i set an on() toa selector and to a cached object at the same time
[20:04:30] <dunkel2> ?
[20:04:56] <dunkel2> something like ($('myselector'),myObject).on()
[20:05:37] <Nomikos> ? add
[20:05:37] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[20:06:14] <dunkel2> ;O!!! awesome thank you Nomikos
[20:06:39] <Nomikos> That's the first time I've used bot-t too \o/
[20:07:14] <dunkel2> xD
[20:10:27] <starkid> hi there... :D !!!
[20:19:44] <coldhead> ?eval ~~"-666"
[20:19:46] <bot-t> coldhead: -666
[20:19:57] <coldhead> ?eval +"-666"
[20:19:57] <bot-t> coldhead: -666
[20:20:28] <Nomikos> What's the ~ do?
[20:20:33] <coldhead> ?eval ~~"asldkalsk"
[20:20:34] <bot-t> coldhead: 0
[20:20:41] <coldhead> ?eval + "asdasd"

[20:20:48] <coldhead> chee: ^^
[20:21:09] <coldhead> Nomikos: it's a sneaky way to convert strings to numbers
[20:21:35] <sneakyness> coldhead, I know it's valentines day but I have a girlfriend now okay?
[20:21:41] <coldhead> Nomikos: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#.7E_(Bitwise_NOT)
[20:21:54] <coldhead> RETURN THE LINGERIE I SENT THEN, SNEAKYNESS
[20:22:03] <sneakyness> the pictures weren't enough?
[20:22:05] <sneakyness> hmph
[20:22:46] <coldhead> naw you can keep them
[20:23:04] <sneakyness> okay
[20:23:06] <sneakyness> <3
[20:23:17] <Nomikos> coldhead: aha interesting, thanks
[20:33:10] <ansdev1> i just mouse spazed and all my buttons in xchat have vanished

[20:33:48] <byomkeshbakshi> I am using a third party jquery selectbox plugin. A select has 10 options. All options are displayed when included on a webpage. But, when I include the select in a Colorbox, only 3 options are displayed. And, no scrollbar also added to the dropdown. I am not sure what could be the issue. How should I debug this issue?
[20:44:47] <r500> how can i set progressbar value for a progressbar using jqueryui on USER DEFINED FUNCTION
[20:49:42] <r500> instead of loading progress bar value in  $(document).ready(function() { };   I want to define function myloadprogress{ and put progress bar value here}
[20:49:53] <r500> any thoughts, solns?
[20:52:39] <r500> a i still not clear in describing my query?
[20:52:50] <r500> am  i still not clear in describing my query?
[20:53:50] <Nomikos> It's been very quiet here in the last couple hours,
[20:55:21] <Nomikos> it seems to me you can do anything that happens inside the jQuery document-ready stuff, you can also do from within a function
[20:55:56] <Nomikos> something like function foo() { $( "#progressbar" ).progressbar({value: 123}); }
[22:24:25] <meghdad> the find method works for getting an element using class name, but doesn't work for another
[22:24:40] <meghdad> the codes are identical, copied over from the working one
[22:25:18] <mehrdad> yo
[22:26:57] <bot-t> mehrdad, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:29:06] <mehrdad> ok i was going to
[22:31:24] <mehrdad> jsfiddle requires me to prepare sample code, but my case is fairly complex , so i choose the others
[22:37:10] <mehrdad> here http://paste.pocoo.org/show/551257/
[22:37:12] <mehrdad> brb
[22:40:01] <mehrdad> so anyone?
[22:41:24] * Nomikos takes a peek
[22:42:02] <Nomikos> mehrdad: is this where it's going wrong? .find('oe_mqLayerManager_master');
[22:42:21] <Nomikos> I've been html'ing for a long time but never seen that tag ;-)
[22:43:04] <ngharo> :)
[22:43:59] <mehrdad> one moment
[22:44:57] <mehrdad> Nomikos, yes, but it won't be exactly undefined, it will contain an empty array
[22:45:13] <mehrdad> [ ]
[22:45:36] <ngharo> class selectors start with a '.'
[22:45:41] <mehrdad> Nomikos, i know what u mean, it is not a tag
[22:46:09] <mindis|wurk> no, but it's a class
[22:46:11] * Nomikos returneth
[22:46:20] <ngharo> you're telling jquery to find <oe_mqLayerManager_master/>
[22:46:28] <mehrdad> ahhh, did i just overlook something so obvious ?! :/
[22:46:41] <Nomikos> mehrdad: happens to the best of us :p
[22:47:11] <mehrdad> well to be honest, i went for the easy way: asking here
[22:47:11] <Nomikos> (at least, I'll assume it does.. I *know* it happens to me, in css more often than elsewhere)
[22:47:34] <mehrdad> thx anyway :)
[22:47:52] <mindis|wurk> i have a habit of doing class=".myclassname" :}
[22:48:02] <mindis|wurk> surprisingly it won't work very well
[22:48:07] <Nomikos> awh :)
[22:48:16] <Nomikos> finicky parsers..
[22:58:37] <mehrdad> say u have a code block that starts with (function($) {   and ends with    })(jQuery);
[22:59:15] <mehrdad> and in that code block u have extended the fn array of an object, in my case it is mapquery
[23:00:18] <mehrdad> and u want to reference the added function in another file, specifically in the code that i pasted , the value of jqueryui_object
[23:01:17] <mehrdad> i have tried accessing the function name, but for
[23:01:18] <mehrdad> return $.fn[this.jqueryui_object].apply(this.$input_picker, arguments);
[23:01:30] <mehrdad> the error returned is $.fn[this.jqueryui_object] is undefined
[23:02:03] <mehrdad> the function being added is defined like this: $.mapQuery.mqLayerManager.fn.extend({
[23:02:19] <mehrdad>    mqLayerManager: function(o) {//some stuff }
[23:03:13] <mehrdad> i set the value of jqueryui_object to  'mqLayerManager',
[23:03:17] <mehrdad> same error
[23:04:03] <mehrdad> set it to jqueryui_object: 'mapQuery.mqLayerManager',
[23:04:05] <mehrdad> same error
[23:04:41] <mehrdad> let me continue debugging in the meantime tho
[23:09:34] <GoSox> i want to have what look like regular A tag links, but I want them to perform query actions instead of redirecting the browser. What's the best way to do this?
[23:09:46] <GoSox> still use A tags, and just give them an ID and no HREF?
[23:10:35] <mindis|wurk> just use preventDefault() when they're clicked
[23:10:59] <mindis|wurk> or have them point to the same page
[23:12:23] <mehrdad> i am curious what do u guys prefer for dynamic web design, frameworks like silverlight and flash or just pure js e.g jquery
[23:12:33] <mehrdad> and do u prefer one over the other?
[23:12:41] <mehrdad> why*
[23:13:30] <mindis|wurk> jquery because it doesn't require heavy and seperate plugins
[23:13:48] <mehrdad> well i was going to say that leave the plugin talk aside
[23:14:00] <mindis|wurk> why leave it, it is relevant
[23:14:10] <mehrdad> disregarding that, just pure functionality and developer experience
[23:15:09] <mindis|wurk> still jquery. actionscript is terrible to debug
[23:15:47] <mindis|wurk> the only good thing about those plugin solutions is that they work the same in every browser
[23:16:10] <mehrdad> haven't had my hand into it, it sounds terrible if it is harder to debug than jq
[23:16:11] <mindis|wurk> plus they do allow some advanced stuff
[23:16:16] <Nomikos> I like not having to have a seperate IDE for dynamic code
[23:17:22] <mehrdad> what about silverlight mindis|wurk , i know it hasn't been successful tho
[23:17:47] <Nomikos> soo.. jQuery for me. Then again I've never yet needed all the advanced stuff that flash can do easily
[23:17:49] <mindis|wurk> haven't really tried it but it still has the same basic caveats as flash
[23:18:11] <mindis|wurk> whether it's a bonus to be able to do windows phone dev remains to be seen
[23:20:54] <mehrdad> well me, i prefer integrated experience top to bottom
[23:21:24] <mehrdad> a real framework, so yes, i do like having a professional ide to simplify things
[23:22:04] <mehrdad> one language to do em all
[23:23:37] <mehrdad> i think the good thing about plugins is that they can be improved and developed ahead of browser
[23:24:13] <mehrdad> decoupled from the browser, no js engine caveats and lags
[23:24:45] <mehrdad> but things are not going that way, quite the opposite
[23:24:55] <mehrdad> the arm version of windows 8 will not allow plugins
[23:25:36] <mehrdad> iphone has no flash player
[23:25:43] <mehrdad> only android allows it for now
[23:27:58] <Nomikos> Some say JS is the assembly of the web. It's the most common denominator, and as long as the various engines stick to *something* resembling, oh, *standards*, all should be well
[23:28:31] <Nomikos> Then we can develop in higher-level 'languages' like coffeescript and jquery and mootools etc, and actually get things done.
[23:28:35] <mindis|wurk> webdev is full of shit anyway, no matter what solution you use
[23:29:00] <Nomikos> Sturgeon's Adage? :-p
[23:30:33] <mehrdad> js is dirty, that's what annoys me, i opened up the jquery core lib sometime ago and i was like wtf looking at the jumbled up codes
[23:30:57] <mehrdad> granted i know little about jquery, but it was still looking like a mess
[23:31:00] <Nomikos> what do you mean, dirty?
[23:31:03] <mindis|wurk> yep, it's a mess, but it only reflects the whole html/css mess
[23:31:23] <mehrdad> mindis|wurk, true
[23:31:31] <mindis|wurk> it's full of gimmicks and hacks because it wasn't meant for the stuff it's being used for today
[23:31:58] <mehrdad> it hurt my eyes Nomikos
[23:32:20] <mehrdad> mindis|wurk, so true
[23:32:31] <mehrdad> and yet nobody could come up with a better solution
[23:32:36] * Nomikos shrugs. Javascript wasn't made to look pretty
[23:32:44] <mehrdad> or maybe some 'bad guy' did
[23:33:09] <Nomikos> The only language I know of that looks "good" is well-written Python
[23:33:16] <mehrdad> Nomikos, i would say c code looks cleaner, that says alot
[23:34:10] <Nomikos> You know C better than JavaScript?
[23:35:08] <mehrdad> i have had a llittle experience with it while doing a school project
[23:35:33] <mehrdad> and yeah, i can write C code more fluently in comparison
[23:35:48] <Nomikos> jQuery is heavily optimized, no language is going to look pretty after that
[23:36:08] <Nomikos> And anything you know will look better than things you are not familiar with
[23:36:21] <mehrdad> yeah i guess so
[23:36:28] <Nomikos> machine code looks like crap :p
[23:37:14] <mehrdad> assembly does yeah
[23:37:32] <Nomikos> the jQuery methods however are what you get to work with, and IMO they look pretty decent. Anyway, this is all a bit subjective..
[23:37:44] <mehrdad> i would say the main issue is as long as u don't know something it will look mind boggling
[23:39:36] <neteffect> hello
[23:39:50] <Zogot> ahoy
[23:39:58] <neteffect> $("#tdb2").button({icons:{primary:"ui-icon-triangle-1-e"}}).addClass("ui-priority-secondary").parent().removeClass("tdbLink");                  i dont know why this isn't working on browsers set to high security.  do i have to rewrite it in javascript?
[23:40:38] <Nomikos> What is the error you are getting in those browsers?
[23:40:52] <neteffect> the button is not rendering
[23:40:58] <mehrdad> hah there goes another issue with js, security
[23:41:00] <Nomikos> Is it possible high-security means no JS?
[23:41:20] <Nomikos> or no JS libraries from another server?
[23:41:44] <mehrdad> ie does not allow some scripting if set to tight security
[23:41:59] <neteffect> oh
[23:42:00] <Nomikos> It /really/ depends on what the actual error is - "it's not working" isn't much to go on
[23:42:19] <neteffect> oh yeah sorry, it doesnt show up.  the class doesn't get changed.
[23:42:26] <mehrdad> i dont think the newer versions are that picky tho, the protected mode will do the job
[23:42:28] <neteffect> the buttons work fine if you put regular security
[23:42:53] <mehrdad> what browser are u using?
[23:42:54] <Nomikos> Is any Javascript running at all, under high security?
[23:43:01] <Nomikos> Explorer, I'm guessing..
[23:43:05] <neteffect> oh um
[23:43:16] <mehrdad> what version
[23:43:39] <Nomikos> I don't know but I know no other browsers with security levels
[23:44:12] <mehrdad> true , i am asking neteffect  tho
[23:44:30] <neteffect> um seems like no script is running in high security heh, i didn't think of that :D
[23:45:15] <mehrdad> u can customize the security settings bit by biy
[23:45:17] <neteffect> ty
[23:45:17] <mehrdad> bit*
[23:45:48] <mehrdad> to allow all js to run, or some js
[23:45:56] <Nomikos> mehrdad: ya, my last remark was wrt my guess, not the version :)
[23:49:08] <izepstan> short question, very glad if someone could help me: http://jsfiddle.net/V3PPt/1/
