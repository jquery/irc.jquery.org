[01:21:13] <izepstan> hello, someone maybe know, it is possible with jquery qTip positioning the tooltip on another div on the page while mouseover on another?
[01:29:59] <dinosaadeh> hi guys i am trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote and trying to let the suggestions open as soon as the text field has focus.. any idea how to do that please?
[01:33:56] <coldhead> dinosaadeh: i think most of the UI/autocomplete wizards are asleep just at the moment, or out partying
[01:34:14] <coldhead> dinosaadeh: you might have better luck at forum.jquery.com
[01:36:00] <dinosaadeh> coldhead: hehe thanks
[01:52:38] <sean`> dinosaadeh, not supported, you'd have to hack it
[01:52:39] <bot-t> (21 hours 20 mins ago) <Aamir> tell sean` check ur inbox.
[01:54:08] <dinosaadeh> sean`: thanks
[01:56:50] <sean`> dinosaadeh, won't be hard, you should just spoof a keypress event, using a focus event
[01:57:45] <dinosaadeh> sean`: this is what i did although i thought a minLength: 0 should do, but had to resort to focus thing

[02:21:23] <ravenzz> what's wrong in this function? http://pastie.org/1984228
[02:21:31] <ravenzz> the recoursive currentPlaybackT = setTimeout(currentPlaybackAds(),1000); assignment?
[02:24:28] <_aron> ravenzz: you're calling currentPlaybackAds before you pass it into setTimeout. Try setTimeout(currentPlaybackAds, 1000);
[02:25:11] <ravenzz> oh
[02:26:30] <nir0> hi guys, when i click on link, it does an ajax request, js is returned and evald, but when i call it through setInterval($("#updater").click(), 5000); it does 1 request on page load, and then just produce an error missing ] after element list, google says its json related, but i dont use json
[02:27:06] <ravenzz> you are right, i was inattentive
[02:27:08] <ravenzz> thank you

[02:32:46] <bot-t> mitnavn, window.onhashchange - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onhashchange
[02:33:06] <mitnavn> Awesome, thanks a lot Cork[home]!
[02:33:13] <Cork[home]> np :)
[02:33:20] <nir0> help me too
[02:34:05] <nir0> ruby_on_tails: try location.href
[02:34:27] <Tant102> ruby_on_tails, <form action="?"> would post to the current page (but wont keep querystrings)
[02:34:42] <ruby_on_tails> hmm location.href works cool
[02:34:51] <Cork[home]> ?p @ nir0
[02:34:51] <bot-t> nir0, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[02:35:00] <ruby_on_tails> Tant102: location.href is better for me
[02:35:00] <Cork[home]> nir0: spesifically the click event function
[02:35:11] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: you might be able to use an empty string too
[02:35:18] <Tant102> nir0, have you tried wrapping it in a anonymous function? setInterval(function() { $('#updater').click(); }, 5000)
[02:35:19] <ruby_on_tails> empty didnt work
[02:35:20] <ruby_on_tails> dunno why
[02:35:30] <ruby_on_tails> i tried it before asking
[02:35:33] <ruby_on_tails> i even tried a "/"
[02:35:39] <gnarf> "#"?
[02:35:49] <Cork[home]> oooh, ya Tant102, thats correct
[02:35:58] <Tant102> nir0, but it sounds like you should have some kind of process-function that both your interval and your click-method calls.
[02:35:59] <Cork[home]> thats the problem
[02:36:27] <nir01> Tant102: sorry repeat plz, network problems
[02:36:46] <Tant102> nir01, setInterval(function() { $('#updater').click(); }, 5000)
[02:36:55] <ruby_on_tails> gnarf: # seems to work but wont work in my case i have a templating system so the base href is changed
[02:36:55] <Tant102> but it sounds like you should have some kind of process-function that both your interval and your click-method calls.
[02:38:19] <gnarf> Tant102: good suggestion ( one method bound to both click and interval.... )
[02:40:33] <nir01> Tant102: works perfectly, thank u !
[02:41:22] <Tant102> nir01: I've got something that may help at http://tant102.mine.nu:81/Scripts/TaskProcessor.js
[02:41:50] <gnarf> Tant102: if only more people thought like you ;)
[02:42:29] <Tant102> It calls /GIR/tasks/process every minute, unless the json returned actually did something, then it keeps calling it. It's basically an attempt to support scheduled tasks without a backend service.
[02:44:22] <Tant102> And you could call processor.Update() to do a check, instead of waiting up to a minute to next check.
[02:48:53] <gnarf> so, is anyone actually working on anything? reading anything interesting lately?
[03:02:13] <Northwoods> how to join all values of checkbox with class='cc_box' , $('.cc_box:checked').val().join(); ?
[03:02:28] <Northwoods> how to join all values of checkbox with class='cc_box' , $('.cc_box:checked').val().join(','); ?
[03:02:42] <Northwoods> with comma ofcourse
[03:03:05] <CVertex> if you look at the docs Northwoods
[03:03:10] <CVertex> val() doesn't return an Array
[03:03:16] <Northwoods> CVertex: correct
[03:03:18] <sean`> CVertex, use .map
[03:03:23] <sean`> Northwoods,*
[03:03:29] <Northwoods> i dont want to use  .each
[03:03:39] <CVertex> too bad>
[03:03:40] <CVertex> ?
[03:03:44] <sean`> Northwoods, .map
[03:04:11] <Northwoods> sean`: thanks
[03:04:24] <CVertex> oh, i forgot about map
[03:04:31] <CVertex> heyyyyaaallll i have a really stupid question
[03:04:41] <CVertex> is there are COMPLETE list of event handlers out there somewhere?
[03:04:56] <sean`> api.jquery.com/category/events
[03:05:19] <CVertex> thanks, but i need javascript ones
[03:05:25] <CVertex> including ontouch and such
[03:05:39] <Northwoods> :)
[03:05:58] <CVertex> something more comprehensive
[03:06:03] <CVertex> everything i've found is a bit out of date
[03:07:13] <CVertex> i'm writing an app that checks to make sure students assignments don't include event handlers in their HTML
[03:07:55] <sean`> why don't you just use a validator?
[03:08:32] <CVertex> for the validation section of the assignment, there are three distinct marks
[03:08:36] <CVertex> 1 for html validation
[03:08:40] <CVertex> 2 for css validation
[03:08:47] <CVertex> 3 for clear separation of style from content
[03:08:54] <CVertex> and behaviour from content
[03:09:08] <CVertex> 1 and 2 are done using the validators
[03:09:11] <CVertex> i just need to do the 3rd
[03:09:42] <CVertex> the problem with the validator APIs is they are out of date
[03:09:53] <CVertex> writing the code isn't hard, i just need a complete list of all the event handlers
[03:12:34] <CVertex> hmmm, here's some desktop ones
[03:12:35] <CVertex> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow
[03:16:04] <gnarf> CVertex: they are all attribs that start with "on" right?
[03:16:33] <CVertex> only specific ones
[03:16:46] <CVertex> cos on_I_Made_This_Up is valid HTML
[03:17:18] <gnarf> CVertex: not really --- it would be suggested to use data-* for that anyway right
[03:17:19] <gnarf> ?
[03:17:46] <CVertex> yeah, but it's still valid and would get through the validators successfully
[03:18:42] <gnarf> CVertex: so build a whitelist of attributes
[03:20:15] <CVertex> hmmm
[03:22:23] <CVertex> btw, these mutation events would be sooo handy
[03:22:46] <CVertex> i've always wanted to register for when new DOM nodes get added into a fragment
[03:24:18] <CVertex> but they're all deprecated
[03:24:22] <CVertex> hmmm, more reading required
[03:26:46] <CVertex> getting closer to a complete list here, http://help.dottoro.com/larrqqck.php
[03:30:42] <CVertex> and it's a spammy page, wonderful
[03:35:54] <linopolus> Hi
[03:36:09] <linopolus> How do I use the HTML5 data-foo attributes from jQuery?
[03:38:07] <sean`> linopolus, can you be more specific?
[03:38:22] <F1skr> how does this selector work $("div", "#some-id"); ?
[03:38:35] <ussher_> Im having an issue with jquery .cookie() plugin.  The issue is that whenever i write to a cooke called 'backurl' another cookie is added with the same name.  So if i have it in the headers of 3 pages and switch between them, each switch adds a cookie.  I expected it to overwrite it since the name is the same.  What am i doing wrong.
[03:39:55] <ussher_> I tried to expire it first, then write it again, didnt seam to work.  here is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/PMCUd6A0
[03:41:26] <jensn> Is there any way to stream a binary file in the browser?
[03:41:52] <sean`> F1skr, get all divs in #some-id
[03:42:25] <sean`> F1skr, it's the same as $('#some-id div')
[03:42:32] <sean`> or $('#some-id').find ('div')
[03:43:26] <linopolus> sean`: First: I have <div data-english="world"></div>, how do I get the "world" with jquery, Second, how do I produce <div data-english="world" data-german="welt"></div> from this first example? I know theres something to do this beyond just accessing the attributes, as it was mentioned in some jquery 1.6 news
[03:43:39] <sean`> $('div').data ('world')
[03:43:44] <F1skr> couldn't seem to find it in the jquery api? but it works as you say thank you sean`
[03:47:12] <Tant102> Should be .data('english')
[03:47:39] <Tant102> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[03:47:50] <Tant102> Or http://api.jquery.com/data
[03:48:07] <linopolus> sean`: sean` I tried it, but it won't work: http://jsfiddle.net/7dszA/
[03:48:35] <sean`> linopolus, you can't set an attribute using data
[03:49:20] <sean`> linopolus, looks like your jsfiddle works like a charm (?)
[03:49:23] <Tant102> linopolus, it outputs 'Holla' as expected.
[03:49:42] <linopolus> o_O here it stays blank
[03:50:10] <Tant102> Have you tried turning it off and on again? ;)
[03:50:54] <linopolus> now it works, :D

[04:55:35] <raRaRa> Hiya.
[04:56:03] <raRaRa> When I updated jQuery to 1.6 then I get undefined for $('#Container').attr('scrollHeight')
[04:56:15] <raRaRa> Any ideas what may have changed?
[04:59:12] <raRaRa> However, my fix would be to use the scrollHeight property of the element. But still, just curious why this changed.
[05:03:29] <raRaRa> Seems like this changed in 1.6. and the new way to access scrollHeight is using .prop
[05:03:33] <raRaRa> Anyhow, thanks :)
[05:11:30] <paul_k> sounds like it was a bug fix since, afaik, there's no 'scrollHeight' attribute on elements -- <div scrollHeight=""></div>
[05:28:50] <stackoverflow> hello
[05:29:27] <stackoverflow> i got a function to toggle in jq
[05:30:19] <amirite> shutup

[05:30:56] <coldhead> amirite?
[05:31:12] <amirite> i love you
[05:32:50] <raRaRa> is there a diff way to get height of a div which includes the padding
[05:35:19] <coldhead> ?height
[05:35:28] <coldhead> oh thanks bot-t
[05:35:45] <coldhead> height() should give you including padding i believe
[05:37:02] <coldhead> apparendly not, sorry raRaRa
[05:37:37] <coldhead> raRaRa: outerHeight()
[05:37:44] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/CGTVJ/
[05:40:28] <raRaRa> nice, thanks coldhead
[05:40:50] <raRaRa> BTW, is it possible to do jquery on a variable that holds html text?
[05:41:21] <coldhead> var giggle = $('p').html() ?
[05:41:21] <raRaRa> e.g. find all images and do something to them
[05:41:29] <raRaRa> Ahh
[05:41:30] <raRaRa> righto :)
[05:41:31] <raRaRa> thanks
[05:41:53] <coldhead> there are a lot of things you can do, take a looksy at the docs

[05:46:28] <rethus> is it wrong to use replace in this code (but seems to work)

[06:16:04] <rethus> split always remove the string which is give to split:   split("PLACEHOLDER");
[06:16:04] <rethus> Is there a way to keep this PLACEHOLDER while splitting?

[06:17:54] <|RicharD|> anybody can help me ? i have this: http://pastebin.com/4gcQFGGQ but it not change the bg background :S
[06:18:47] <|RicharD|> where i wrong ?
[06:18:51] <rethus> "asdf PLACEHOLDER fdsa" split it on the "PLACEHODER" but keep the placeholder to the second-split-array
[06:19:13] <rethus> meaning split without removing text of the inputstring
[06:19:14] <|RicharD|> these is my php code that generate the output:        		$(".bg .outerWrap").css("background", "url('/'.<?php echo $products['Product']['dir_imgbig'].'/'.$products['Product']['filename_imgbig']; ?>.'')");
[06:19:41] <skylamer`> remove the dots
[06:20:40] <gnarf> rethus: nothing builtin

[06:21:16] <|RicharD|> skylamer`: you say to me ?where i must remove the . ?
[06:21:27] <gnarf> rethus: i assume you aren't splitting on placehoder

[06:23:14] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/75K8Na5y
[06:23:36] <rethus> should be splittet by PINENTRY and Second time on CDR Variables
[06:24:05] <rethus> after that i send the 3 array's to a parser-function which create js-usable vars
[06:25:31] <rethus> why this didn't work? (debug) ? console.log("Split-Function:\n\t"+line) : "";
[06:25:39] <rethus> debug is not set, but the console.log shows the message
[06:36:03] <Fox`> grr there are SO many edit in place plugins, but they're all exactly the same
[06:39:37] <Krinkle> ?1.7
[06:40:23] <Krinkle> rethus: Why put the 'debug' in (parens) ?
[06:40:40] <rethus> clear code-style :)
[06:40:54] <Krinkle> ? How is that.
[06:40:54] <Krinkle> rethus: Is the variable named 'debug' or 'line'
[06:40:59] <rethus> works now... i had a copy of this function below... therefor there was the output (blush)
[06:41:07] <Krinkle> ?eval debug ? 'yes' : 'no';

[06:44:41] <Tyris> I'm having an odd issue with plugin dependencies
[06:45:48] <Tyris> If I do $('#some_id').my_plugin(); where my plugin contains roughly: return this.each(function(){ $(this).tinymce(); });
[06:46:18] <Tyris> then it fails; but if I call $('some_other_id').tinymce(); first then the above works (as if the first calls causes the plugin to load properly...)
[06:46:47] <Tyris> completely lost; so any direction welcome
[06:48:14] <binni> is it possible to easily make some elements, a div with a few buttons inside it for example, completely non-interact-able (no clicking, draging, etc..) and then make it interact-able again?

[07:03:58] <bootstrap> hex += ( (tmp.length == 2) ? tmp : '0' + tmp );    what does tmp:'0' do?
[07:04:28] <Tyris> bootstrap, makes sure its 2 digits in length
[07:04:48] <Tyris> its a ternary statement (wiki it if you don't know what that is)
[07:05:09] <Krinkle> bootstrap: basically this: (with extra parens for the human eye)
[07:05:10] <Krinkle> hex += ( ( (tmp.length == 2) ? tmp : '0' ) + tmp );
[07:05:46] <Krinkle> eh, scrap that
[07:06:06] <Krinkle> hex += tmp.length == 2 ? tmp : ( '0'  + tmp );
[07:06:09] <bootstrap> '0' + tmp is one choice?
[07:06:13] <bootstrap> ah

[07:18:09] <Mooseman> hi
[07:19:01] <Mooseman> hi
[07:19:14] <jtarragon> hi there
[07:19:42] <Mooseman> quick: favorite UI code
[07:20:10] <Mooseman> .hide("puff", {}, 500);
[07:21:07] <Mooseman> come on...
[07:23:20] <jtarragon> I'm having trouble displaying the jquery slider, I've put up a simple example http://jsfiddle.net/FpcSK/
[07:23:55] <jtarragon> jquery is not complaining, but the slider is not showing at all
[07:24:44] <ShawnRisk> I am trying to use .show and .hide with .hover. .animate and .stop but everytime I do this the slider flickers.  I think because it wants to show and hide at the same time.  How do I fix this?
[07:25:45] <Jayflux> you have a link or can you put it into Jsfiddle ShawnRisk ?
[07:26:23] <Jayflux> also ShawnRisk have you tried using toggle(); ?
[07:26:24] <cdevroe> Hi, I'm looking for help with a selector problem. (I think) Is this the right place to ask?
[07:26:34] <Jayflux> ?toggle @ ShawnRisk
[07:26:40] <ShawnRisk> one sec
[07:27:03] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: http://ecosanity.org/ and http://pastebin.com/GedZgMcG
[07:27:06] <Jayflux> yes cdevroe name your problem
[07:27:11] <ShawnRisk> this is when you hover over the slideshow
[07:27:39] <Jayflux> you deffo have some problems there
[07:27:52] <cdevroe> Jayflux: I'm trying to have jQuery show a button whenever a table row is hovered.
[07:28:06] <Jayflux> right
[07:28:14] <Jayflux> set your button to display:none; in your CSS cdevroe
[07:28:25] <cdevroe> The button is in the corresponding row.  Something like table > tr > td > a.actionbutton > img
[07:28:46] <cdevroe> Here is my JS.
[07:28:47] <cdevroe> $('table#itemlist tr').hover(function(event) {
[07:28:48] <cdevroe>       $(this).children('td:last').children('.actionbutton').toggle();
[07:28:48] <cdevroe>   });
[07:29:01] <Jayflux> then use a selector similar to $('table').mouseover(function() { $('button').show();});
[07:29:37] <cdevroe> The selector is fine, I think, because if I do an alert on .attr('class') is shows me the right class.
[07:29:43] <cdevroe> But toggle() no worky.
[07:29:49] <jtarragon> is there a way I could debug the slider not showing up?
[07:30:05] <jtarragon> jquery does actually insert the slider code, but nothing is visible
[07:30:08] <Jayflux> hmm you have a link cdevroe
[07:30:34] <cdevroe> Jayflux: I don't but I could drum one up in a few minutes perhaps. Working locally at the moment.
[07:30:52] <cdevroe> Is there any reason toggle() wouldn't work?
[07:31:02] <Jayflux> put it into jsfiddle.net cdevroe
[07:31:07] <Jayflux> then we can help you
[07:31:32] <Jayflux> ShawnRisk give us a second
[07:31:41] <ShawnRisk> okay
[07:35:01] <cdevroe> jsfiddle looks neat, but haven't used it.
[07:36:47] <qom2> http://www.akqa.com/#/work/akqa/microwaves â€“ anyone that knows a script that works like this page? using arrows to navigate to the next page? I've only found different slideshows, but they are mostly for images only, and seldom full screen. I also want the possibility to link to a certain "slide"/page.
[07:37:15] <cdevroe> Yeah, not sure it is worth the trouble trying to put this together on jsfiddle. I'll keep stabbing at it. There must be a requirement of toggle() that I simply don't know. It definitely has the correct selector.
[07:38:54] <cdevroe> And... just like that I found the answer. Jayflux: I was display: none; on the img instead of the a. :(  It is always something simple, isn't it?
[07:39:05] <Jayflux> yep
[07:39:40] <cdevroe> Thanks for your willingness to help.
[07:39:45] <cdevroe> Anything I can do for you?
[07:40:14] <sunscreen> HMM
[07:40:25] <sunscreen> if you window.open on a mobile device will it work
[07:40:40] <sunscreen> can you make a button to switch back the window that it came from
[07:40:52] <Jayflux> ShawnRisk why are there so many tables in your site
[07:41:52] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: Just my fault.  I will fix this correctly when I get everything else working.  I know I should have done this at first but I am in too deep now.  When done I will get the tables all sorted out.
[07:45:39] <Jayflux> just recreating it
[07:46:00] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: I will, but can we get jQuery working?
[07:46:10] <Jayflux> yeah im just looking through
[07:47:04] <ShawnRisk> back
[07:47:06] <jtarragon> how can I debug my code if jQuery is not throwing any errors?
[07:48:22] <Jayflux> ShawnRisk you have everything happenin under the 1 hover function, you need to split it really
[07:48:26] <Jayflux> to mouse over and mouseout
[07:49:05] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: I saw that lots of people do what I do, and it seems to work out somewhat
[07:52:23] <Jayflux> hmm
[07:54:16] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: you might be right, but doesn't mouse over and mouseout do the same as hover?
[07:55:00] <Jayflux> yes your function seems to be running twice when you hover over the .cover text causing it to loop
[07:55:12] <sunscreen> hm
[07:55:50] <felo> I want to know if i have the right syntax by creating a function after .data('commentid') ---->  $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid')function get(){
[07:58:57] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: I thought so.  I need two functions with mouseover and mouseout instead of hover?
[07:59:33] <Jayflux> hold on
[07:59:35] <Jayflux> just fixing it up
[08:00:11] <ShawnRisk> okay
[08:01:30] <Jayflux> ahhhh i see
[08:03:11] <Jayflux> ShawnRisk you need to put your .cover inside your field div
[08:03:27] <Jayflux> when it leaves the image it hides the p description
[08:03:47] <Jayflux> but when it hovers over the p description it tries to show it again, you should make one global div that covers both
[08:05:52] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: put .cover inside slider?
[08:06:44] <Jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/8e6HK/
[08:06:46] <Jayflux> getting there
[08:08:00] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: okay
[08:08:21] <|RicharD|> anybody here ?
[08:13:30] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: any other thoughts?
[08:17:39] <Jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/8e6HK/1/
[08:17:47] <Jayflux> ShawnRisk try the js from that
[08:19:15] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: looks like this is fixed.  Thanks.
[08:20:02] <jtarragon> will someone please take a quick look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/FpcSK/12/ I'm trying to debug it but nothing comes out
[08:21:37] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: Can I pm with a non-jquery question?
[08:21:39] <Jayflux> although ShawnRisk you have been better putting cover inside slides class
[08:21:41] <Jayflux> sure
[08:22:03] <Jayflux> that way when you leave the slides to click on your selector your description doesnt go back up
[08:22:48] <Jayflux> but i suppose the plugin won't let you do that
[08:25:54] <ShawnRisk> I am back
[08:25:59] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: can I pm you?
[08:26:05] <Jayflux> sure
[08:27:51] <cdtank> anybody here with experience with juqery + plupload file uploader plugin?
[08:28:15] <domino14> i use $.post and pass in a javascript map
[08:28:53] <domino14> like an object; how come $.post turns stuff like {a: {b: true}} into 'a[b]': 'true' ?
[08:29:00] <domino14> how do i parse this back into an object on the receiving end easily
[08:29:39] <cdtank> domino14:  it kind of depends on what server-side tech you are using.
[08:30:19] <cdtank> domino14: i "think" you might be able to use some kind of json parser to access the contents.
[08:31:05] <Moo-_-> domino14: what you want to do is to make toJSON call before sending the data, and on the server-side call parseJSON to make again native objects out of it?
[08:31:29] <domino14> Moo-_-:  i was looking for something like that; i was unaware that jquery had a toJSON command..
[08:31:42] <Moo-_-> domino14: it does not
[08:31:59] <Moo-_-> but there are various other javascript microframeworks + plugins to jquery itself
[08:32:01] <Moo-_-> also
[08:32:14] <Moo-_-> if you don't target IE all modern browsers have native toJSON
[08:37:34] <beeviz> how can i extend functions which extend the jquery object?
[08:37:50] <beeviz> i have jQuery.extend({myMethod: function() {}});
[08:37:59] <beeviz> $.myMethod();
[08:38:03] <wookiehangover> ? plugins
[08:38:12] <beeviz> now I need something like $.myMethod().stop();
[08:38:53] <wookiehangover> why are you attaching to the $?
[08:38:58] <wookiehangover> is it a plugin?
[08:39:30] <zmbmartin> I am setting flash messages on a page with ajax I want to trigger a live event to fade the flash messages out. I just want the trigger to fire when there is any change to #messages.
[08:39:35] <zmbmartin> What event do I use
[08:39:48] <beeviz> yes. it's a plugin
[08:40:07] <zmbmartin> I tried live change but that does not seem to be working
[08:40:10] <wookiehangover> zmbmartin: there's not an attachable event for changes to text node
[08:40:36] <wookiehangover> beeviz: so chaining custom methods off of a plugin isn't a good idea
[08:40:54] <wookiehangover> $.myPluginStop()
[08:40:59] <zmbmartin> wookiehangover: how can I accomplish this?
[08:41:07] <wookiehangover> is a much more maintainable pattern
[08:41:10] <beeviz> ah ok. then i'll do it that way :)
[08:41:35] <wookiehangover> zmbmartin: using an evented pattern
[08:41:58] <wookiehangover> at some point some other javascript is putting content into that node, right?
[08:42:06] <zmbmartin> yes
[08:42:22] <wookiehangover> so at that point you should fire an event to do whatever
[08:42:56] <wookiehangover> http://yehudakatz.com/2009/04/20/evented-programming-with-jquery/
[08:43:03] <wookiehangover> old, but good content
[08:45:30] <njbair> how can I wrap a new element around the selected element?
[08:46:01] <Visualiza> hi folk. is this how you should make an array (of a class of DOM nodes) with jQuery?: jQuery.makeArray($(".someClass"))
[08:46:25] <wookiehangover> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[08:46:34] <wookiehangover> Visualiza:
[08:46:36] <wookiehangover> no
[08:46:46] <wookiehangover> $('.blah').get()
[08:46:57] <Visualiza> i see, thanks
[08:47:00] <wookiehangover> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[08:47:41] <Whirl3d> Good morning all.

[08:50:56] <|RicharD|> http://jsbin.com/icona4/edit
[08:51:01] <|RicharD|> not change the background image ?
[08:56:41] <|RicharD|> where i wrong with this ? 				$(".outerWrap").css("background", "url('/<?php echo $products['Product']['dir_casting'].'/'.$products['Product']['filename_casting']; ?>')"); ???
[08:57:07] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: uhh, you can't execute php code in the client's browser?
[08:57:22] <|RicharD|> it in a php page
[08:57:22] <dabear> lol
[08:57:24] <|RicharD|> the do a output
[08:57:40] <|RicharD|> so it produce a output that is:
[08:57:52] <dabear> |RicharD|: see ?paste
[08:57:52] <bot-t> |RicharD|, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:58:24] <|RicharD|> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/396710/

[08:59:17] <asi> I'm trying to develop a plugin for my app. Can I call a plugin function to a variable in side the plugin context?
[08:59:17] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: if that's in a php page, that's a ##php question then, not a #jquery one. #jquery is client-side, that's why i said the php thing...
[08:59:35] <|RicharD|> pls i hope that you joke :)
[08:59:42] <|RicharD|> is a syntax problem with javascript
[08:59:44] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: the problem is that you are on windows, right?
[08:59:56] <|RicharD|> yes but also on server linux
[08:59:59] <|RicharD|> it not work
[09:00:02] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: because windows uses backslash for directory structure
[09:00:11] <|RicharD|> isn't these the problem
[09:00:13] <|RicharD|> :)
[09:00:18] <|RicharD|> i tried with also correct slash
[09:00:26] <skylamer`> |RicharD| make ;';escape cha
[09:00:39] <|RicharD|> what you mean ?
[09:01:08] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: when you do that, what does the background get set to? check firebug to see...
[09:01:43] <|RicharD|> it not set nothing :(
[09:02:08] <|RicharD|> istead if i tried with a simple "background", "url('asd.png')" it work
[09:02:40] <felo> RicharD: is this syntax ok ----> $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid',function(){
[09:03:01] <felo> I initiate a function  after 'commentid
[09:03:14] <|RicharD|> ?
[09:03:18] <|RicharD|> why these sorry ?
[09:03:34] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: the problem is that you use backslashes
[09:03:44] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: backslashes are escape characters
[09:04:02] <|RicharD|> and if istead of \ i use  /
[09:04:07] <|RicharD|> it will be work ?
[09:04:12] <bittyx-laptop> |RicharD|: that should work, yes
[09:04:51] <|RicharD|> yes it work :S
[09:04:57] <|RicharD|> sorry for time spent :)
[09:05:02] <felo> bittyx-laptop: is this syntax ok ----> $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid',function(){ I initiated a function after the data-commentid attribute
[09:05:42] <felo> I want to send the commentid data to the server
[09:05:50] <ShawnRisk> how do I turn the pager from numbers into thumbnails using: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ ?
[09:06:20] <asi> I'm trying to develop a plugin for my app. Can I call a plugin function to a variable in side the plugin context?
[09:06:59] <bittyx-laptop> asi: if i understand what you're asking, is there any reason you think you can't?
[09:07:07] <kevinmonk> Anyone able to help with this questiona bout using Ajax defereds with a $(selector).each('form.changed')? I've got my code here http://jsfiddle.net/CLhNw/
[09:07:32] <bittyx-laptop> if i want to implement the kind of thing that some sites use for automatic loading of new data when you scroll to the bottom of the page, which event should i use? i've been searching but can't find anything that looks even remotely similar to .scrollIntoView() ? should i do something like manually calculating the offset of the element vs. window height vs. scrollbar position etc. to find out?
[09:08:24] <asi> bittyx-laptop: Yep. When I call the plugin function addFieldActions(); to a variable firebug says field.addFieldActions is not a function
[09:08:38] <kevinmonk> It works if I just write a list of the Ajax calls but some forms are added dynamically so I'm not sure how many forms would be submitted. I'm returning a deferred object I believe.
[09:09:44] <bittyx-laptop> asi: i dunno, maybe pastebin some code so we can see what you're doing?
[09:09:50] <felo> I want to ajax data-attribute to the server in here http://jsfiddle.net/DN5he/7/
[09:10:36] <felo> i want to know as the html structure where the data of $id is in commentid or #replyCommentId id of the input field
[09:11:11] <ShawnRisk> seems no one knows my question
[09:11:21] <subsume> How could I make my inactive window tab blink?
[09:13:01] <|RicharD|> there is any script for panning a image of background ?
[09:13:13] <felo> How can I send a html data-attribute id to jquery?
[09:14:18] <felo> how can I the data attribute in span to jquery ? ----> <span class="comment" data-commentid="'.$id.'"
[09:16:36] <Whirl3d> is it okay to have a "." in an element's html id?   <div id='page.topic'> for example?
[09:17:36] <subsume> How can I tell if my window is not active?
[09:23:31] <Visualiza> Whirl3d: i don't think so, that would cause problems in CSS when #page.topic looks like #page.className. i think people use page-topic' instead
[09:24:15] <Visualiza> anyone know how to look within a node and pull out all the inner nodes of a certain class, even if they're not children but grandchildren etc. ?
[09:24:56] <subsume> ew why would you want to pull out all of the inner nodes of one of your grandchildren
[09:25:50] <subsume> anyway I think it would be findAll()
[09:27:22] <Andy-> hi guys, is there a way of selectin element X - Y. i.e. if I have 100 div.container, can I tell jQuery to display numbers 58-63
[09:27:31] <Andy-> without looping
[09:28:55] <Visualiza> subsume: thanks. but, is there a findAll? do you mean just .find() perhaps
[09:29:19] <subsume> I think there's a findAll
[09:29:33] <subsume> but find seems like it
[09:29:57] <Visualiza> i thought there was a findAll to, but can't find the documentation
[09:30:04] <Visualiza> *too

[09:33:46] <clockwize> how wou
[09:34:15] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood hey
[09:34:18] <lenswipe> o/
[09:35:19] <clockwize> i have a div with a load of spans in it, each contains a word, how would I find the span with the word "blah" in it? can I do that with a selector?
[09:36:48] <dabear> ?:contains
[09:36:49] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[09:36:58] <dabear> @clockwize
[09:37:14] <dabear> note that using such selectors are slow
[09:37:34] <clockwize> yeah, i saw that... but what if i was looking for blah, and there were 2 spans with "blahhhh" and "blah", it would get both right?
[09:38:03] <dabear> you would
[09:38:27] <clockwize> ok.. i'll maybe find a betteer way
[09:40:37] <dabear> clockwize: select all your spans, then do a .filter( function(){  return this.innerHTML.indexOf("string") > 0 })
[09:40:38] <bittyx-laptop> asi: i'm not sure what you're trying to do there? are you trying to redefine the function .extend() ? is that your complete code or only part of it?
[09:40:44] <dabear> and adapt that to your needs
[09:42:52] <asi> bittyx-laptop: I want to concatenate the string in the actions vairable in the addFieldActions method
[09:43:19] <asi> this is the plugin part.
[09:43:47] <asi> error occurs in line 25
[09:47:02] <dabear> asi: you know field is a string? strings do not have an addFieldActions() method
[09:47:46] <dabear> man that code of yours is fcked up
[09:48:05] <dabear>  addFieldActions is wrong too
[09:48:15] <dabear> you can't do this + "text"
[09:49:20] <asi> dabear: hehehe... I'm a newbie to plugin development. this is my very first try.
[09:49:40] <dabear> asi: focus on learning javascript
[09:50:03] <dabear> this would be obvious if you did know some js :)
[09:50:17] <asi> dabear: yeah.. thanks.

[09:51:33] <g4> how can I "click" on an a element using jquery (for navigating to href)? $('#ahref').click() doesn't work?
[09:52:45] <dabear> g4: that works, if that id exists
[09:53:17] <njbair> I've got a page with a table on it. I'd like the table header to appear fixed at the top of the page, but only if the user has scrolled past its default location. Can someone point me in the right direction?

[09:54:17] <asi> dabear: do you recommend any books?
[09:54:22] <njbair> can you recommend a good one?
[09:54:50] <g4> dabear: ok, I will need to investigate a bit further then, I get a recursion error inside jquery when I try that

[09:55:21] <Jakey> please just stop asking question and just go learn
[09:55:24] <njbair> thanks
[09:55:27] <djQuery> or 20 seconds of google turned up how to do this in pure css http://www.imaputz.com/cssStuff/bigFourVersion.html
[09:55:28] <dabear> g4: yes, if you do a click inside a click and that clicks something which you listened to, that might happen
[09:55:44] <dabear> listened to in the click handler*
[09:56:56] <g4> dabear: ahh, I see, I have the click on a li and want a click on the li to click the a inside. Maybe it bubbles up back again
[09:57:16] <dabear> g4: yes it does
[09:58:39] <dabear> g4: untested, but maybe something like this might work: var ev = $.Event("click"); ev.stopPropagation(); $("someanchor").trigger(ev)
[09:59:52] <djQuery> g4: $('li:has(a)').click(fucntion(e){ $(this).children('a:first').triger('click', e); '});  $('li>a').click(function(e){  e.stopPropogation(); do other stuff here; });
[10:00:10] <dabear> mine is shorter^^
[10:00:35] <g4> excellent, thank you guys!
[10:00:45] <djQuery> dabear: mine included both the li and the a code
[10:01:13] <dabear> but mine is valid
[10:01:20] <dabear> yours raises a syntax error :)
[10:01:55] <djQuery> dabear: ok we are all learning here whats wrong with mine?
[10:02:43] <dabear> mine does the stoppropagation in the triggering, yours in the binding
[10:06:15] <g4> if ("LI" == e.target.tagName) {location.href = $(this).find("a").attr("href");} :)
[10:34:21] <TomLeyton> Hey all, I have a question, I know this is not pure jquery, but I guess jquery probably offers a way to do it, i'm trying to get a "popup" menu (in a div container) to be docked to the bottom of the page, and remain there even through scrolling. The popup is smaller then the page width, so it should go above the page when opened, and not move the entire page up (I did see an example to do this
[10:34:22] <TomLeyton> with jquery). Currently my div is set with css position: fixed and position: expression('absolute'), it works fine on FF and Chrome but not on IE. Anyone has any idea?
[10:34:40] <robsonkarls> yo how can i delete a entire  object with jquery?? $('#id').remove() ??
[10:35:15] <robsonkarls> pls halpppp
[10:35:43] <Jakey> its IE CSS problem
[10:35:47] <Jakey> go figure
[10:35:52] <Jakey> i hate IE 6 7
[10:36:04] <robsonkarls> ie 7 is the new ie6
[10:36:08] <DoctorDarren> Can a draggable detect if another draggable has been dropped on top of it? (I want to stop draggables overlapping)
[10:36:15] <robsonkarls> ie6 doenst exist anymore
[10:36:20] <Jakey> yes robbyoconnor
[10:36:21] <DoctorDarren> If not, can I make a div both draggable and droppable?
[10:36:26] <Jakey> yes robsonkarls
[10:36:33] <robsonkarls> if u are developing for ie6 just quit ur job
[10:36:38] <enapupe> Hi, I have images binded to open a galery overflow, but don't know why when I click this anchor on firefox the body is scrolling up, only in firefox.
[10:36:51] <TomLeyton> :) I did figure that one out, but I do need to support all three (especially since IE is still the leading browser use wise
[10:36:58] <TomLeyton> Any idea on how to get it to work?
[10:37:15] <robsonkarls> my question is simple guys help me

[10:39:26] <paul_irish> okay!
[10:39:35] <TomLeyton> paul_irish, can you please read my above question?
[10:39:43] <paul_irish> i coulddddd
[10:39:44] <robsonkarls> but follow sample in jquery IP, i dont know if it will delete data inside the div
[10:39:53] <robsonkarls> API*
[10:41:27] <pifantastic> ?tias
[10:41:27] <paul_irish> TomLeyton: what is position:expression('absolute') ?
[10:41:27] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:41:58] <TomLeyton> I have no clue really. It's what I found in some example.
[10:42:10] <paul_irish> trash it brah
[10:43:04] <enapupe> paul_irish: I left a comment at one snippet of yours, did you see? can't remeber where.. github? bitbucket? google code? too much names :P
[10:43:16] <paul_irish> let's just say i saw it!
[10:43:19] <enapupe> hhaha
[10:43:21] <TomLeyton> I tried removing it, it will get the entire thing to stop working in FF and chrome too
[10:43:24] <TomLeyton> I guess it does something...
[10:43:28] <enapupe> about stripping analytics params from the url
[10:43:46] <paul_irish> TomLeyton: you should like.. put up a jsfiddle recreating this or just share your site
[10:43:48] <Jakey> its a css problme i tell ya
[10:43:58] <paul_irish> yes it is
[10:43:58] <enapupe> I'm using, it's beautiful
[10:44:12] <paul_irish> enapupe: ah. v
[10:44:13] <paul_irish> https://gist.github.com/626834
[10:44:15] <TomLeyton> Thanks, I will, just a second.
[10:50:01] <TomLeyton> Oh, I think I found a fix, lol.
[10:50:05] <TomLeyton> Looking into it.
[10:50:19] <TomLeyton> Somehow in the test i'm making it's working well, but in my site it doesn't.
[10:53:06] <jonh> swagg?

[10:53:52] <Will123456> hey guys. i can't for the life of me figure out actually how to 'add' a jquery plugin to jquery. how is it done>
[10:54:16] <bittyx-laptop> Will123456: are you talking about making a plugin or using an existing one that you've downloaded?
[10:54:33] <Will123456> bittyx-laptop: the latter, using one i've downloaded
[10:55:03] <bittyx-laptop> Will123456: well just include it in your <head>, like <script src="/js/plugin_name.js"></script>
[10:55:18] <bittyx-laptop> Will123456: include it after jquery, but before your custom .js file or whatever you use
[10:55:51] <bittyx-laptop> Will123456: and then, in your own custom .js where you actually program stuff, just use the plugin like it was already a part of jquery
[10:55:55] <Will123456> bittyx-laptop: oh, that's it? wow, okay. no wonder i didn't find anything :P
[10:56:31] <bittyx-laptop> Will123456: well, try it, if you run into any problems, feel free to ask here again, but yeah, that's how it's usually done
[10:57:27] <Will123456> bittyx-laptop: thanks very much :)  i had assumed it'd be more complicated, but i'm pleasantly surprised
[10:57:37] <bittyx-laptop> Will123456: you're welcome
[10:59:16] <gaius65> I'm looking for a templating engine which totally works inside js.
[10:59:19] <gaius65> Does someone has experience with the tempalting engines Orange-J or mustache.js?
[11:00:09] <gaius65> Or some other recommendations?
[11:02:30] <enapupe> How can I hide the main scrollbars in firefox? I'm doing $("html").css("overflow", "hidden"); but this is scrolling up the page.
[11:07:11] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Hey brother, what's up?
[11:07:16] <lenswipe> mn
[11:07:18] <lenswipe> nm*
[11:08:24] <Jakey> sup sup
[11:08:34] <lenswipe> u?
[11:10:22] <Jakey> nm
[11:10:25] <Jakey> u?
[11:11:23] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Notta. Just figuring out what to do with my day
[11:11:35] <Will123456> $("#foo") grabs any element with the ID of foo, right?
[11:14:46] <lenswipe> Will123456 there should only be one element with the id of "foo" but yes
[11:14:56] <stackoverflow> hello guys
[11:15:00] <lenswipe> Will123456 more than 1 you should be using classes
[11:15:41] <stackoverflow> sombody knows how to make easyslider adpt its pictures to the div where its conteined ?
[11:15:49] <Will123456> lenswipe: i tried using classes but i didn't really work, so i switched to using IDs. perhaps i'm using the plugin wrong though. i'll get back to you once i've tested it :P
[11:16:05] <lenswipe> Will123456 what are you trying to do?
[11:16:15] <lenswipe> Will123456 cant garuntee i can help but im not sure unless i see the code
[11:17:28] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood having fixed a few bugs i think ima implement CKEditor
[11:17:31] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood is it hard?
[11:21:29] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Nope, super simple. I was messing with it all night long.
[11:21:54] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Just make sure to use the jQuery adapter and your life will be awesome.
[11:24:51] <TomLeyton> paul_irish, I still can't get it to work properly... for some reason only in my site on IE it doesn't work
[11:24:59] <TomLeyton> on a regular IE example is works fine
[11:25:42] <Will123456> lenswipe: i'm trying to use http://pvdspek.github.com/jquery.autoellipsis/ this plugin, but for the life of me i can't get it to work. does anyone know of a simple, smallish ellipsis jquery plugin that'll definitely, definitely work?
[11:26:07] <TomLeyton> it also comes in the form of another problem (not quite the same), the width of my div changes between my example and my site
[11:26:16] <TomLeyton> and I can't figure why as I am using the exact same css file
[11:26:49] <lenswipe> Will123456 why use jquery for autoelipsis?
[11:26:56] <lenswipe> Will123456 you know you can do it with CSS right?
[11:27:01] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im going to go fucking insane
[11:27:08] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Why's that?
[11:27:27] <Will123456> lenswipe: firefox doesn't seem to support it, and google chrome on my machine doesn't, even though it apparently can.
[11:27:53] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood just explaining to my mother how to edit content on the site, shes pointing at the textbox and going "i dont know what any of that means" and im hard to put to not to shout "IM FUCKING TELLING YOU WHAT IT MEANS - ITS THE PAGE FUCKING CONTENT!!!!!"
[11:28:00] <lenswipe> Will123456 ....strange..
[11:28:16] <Will123456> lenswipe: i'm pretty sure FF doesn't support it either way, and i want FF support as a minimum
[11:28:18] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Once you put CKEditor in place, you won't have to worry about that.
[11:28:57] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood yeah i know, but surely its easy to figure out that you type text in box. user hits save. text appears on page.
[11:29:16] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood how easy is it to implement ckeditor
[11:29:20] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Are you nuts?!? That is fucking rocket science.
[11:29:34] <lenswipe> how is it rocket science?
[11:29:45] <lenswipe> its the same principle as word
[11:29:52] <Will123456> damn, and lenswipe is a brain surgeon
[11:29:58] <lenswipe> ?_?
[11:29:59] <bot-t> lenswipe, #5052 ("_" is redundant in many selectors of Sizzle) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 17 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5052
[11:30:13] <lenswipe> bot-t fckEdit offf
[11:30:14] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: CKEditor is easy as hell. like I said, I was working on modifying it most of the night and found it to be the easiest thing ever, especially with the jQuery adapter.
[11:30:23] <lenswipe> right
[11:30:29] <lenswipe> but how easy is it to disable all the colours and shit
[11:30:41] <bittyx-laptop> lenswipe: for a regular computer user, yeah, it's nothing out of the ordinary. but in my experience, some people, especially older ones who didn't actually grow up with computers, either have a hard time figuring out how something works, or don't really care that much (e.g. my mom asks me how to do stuff on the computer all the time, and most of the time she asks the same things - she just doesn't care enough to think about it and remember it)
[11:31:03] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Very easy. You just setup the config.js to only show the tools you want the user to use.
[11:31:05] <bittyx-laptop> lenswipe: and fwiw, my mom is pretty computer-savvy, compared to some other people i know
[11:31:18] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood cool, and can it be made to produce valid html?
[11:31:34] <dabear> my mom is better than yours
[11:31:36] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: It produces valid xhtml
[11:31:42] <lenswipe> perfect.
[11:31:43] <bittyx-laptop> lenswipe: so don't be mad at your mother, she's not a programmer like you :P
[11:32:44] <sdio> What editors do you guys use? I've been using sublime text (and vim on linux), but wondering if I should switch.
[11:33:00] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: actually, my mom programmed in cobol when she was young (that's what they used back then). it's just some stuff like granting permissions to apps to do something, or cleaning viruses etc. that she doesn't care to learn :P
[11:33:12] <lenswipe> sdio i use netbeans
[11:33:15] <lenswipe> sdio and i love it
[11:33:31] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: I use Aptana Studio and Netbeans.
[11:33:55] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: my mom used puch cards daily, so she's better
[11:34:58] <Will123456> bittyx-laptop: my mum tells me the "i did BASIC once or twice" anecdote all the time
[11:35:01] <Will123456> it's getting on my nerves
[11:35:03] <sdio> lenswipe: probably looking for something more lightweight.
[11:35:06] <Whirl3d> anybody got a good regex to clean up a string by removing all characters that aren't numbers or letters?
[11:35:22] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: What platform?
[11:35:28] <sdio> Whirl3d: [a-zA-Z0-9]?
[11:36:04] <sdio> DanAKAHollywood: Primarily windows, I'm fairly proficient with vim on linux, just hate having to get autocomplete working. I'm used to intellisense :(.
[11:36:12] <Whirl3d> sdio, I must be doing something else wrong then. Thanks
[11:36:23] <DanAKAHollywood> Whirl32: s/[a-zA-Z0-9]// with sed.
[11:36:36] <snover> congratulations on two people not reading the question
[11:36:37] <DanAKAHollywood> Whirl3d: *
[11:36:46] <dabear> ?eval "234234ddf  32342\t".replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/, "" )
[11:36:46] <bot-t> dabear: "34234ddf 32342\t"
[11:37:05] <DanAKAHollywood> snover: You're absolutely right... I completely misread that question.
[11:37:06] <dabear> ?eval "234234ddf 32342\t".replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]/, "" )
[11:37:07] <bot-t> dabear: "34234ddf 32342\t"
[11:37:13] <dabear> meh
[11:37:23] <DanAKAHollywood> Whirl3d: Yea, don't use that.
[11:37:30] <snover> more importantly, define â€œletterâ€
[11:38:10] <Cork[home]> ?eval "234234ddf 32342\t".replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "")
[11:38:10] <bot-t> Cork[home]: "34234ddf 32342\t"
[11:38:14] <Cork[home]> hmm
[11:38:21] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: http://editra.org/
[11:38:22] <Cork[home]> ah
[11:38:24] <snover> jesus christ you guys
[11:38:29] <Cork[home]> :)
[11:38:35] <sdio> ?eval "234234ddf 32342\t".replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "")
[11:38:36] <bot-t> sdio: "234234ddf32342"
[11:38:36] <TomLeyton> hey, trying to look for other solutions for my problem, how can I set a div window to the bottom when receiving a scroll event ?
[11:38:55] <Cork[home]> snover: not even sure what they'r trying to do :)
[11:39:13] <sdio> wait, what was the question?
[11:39:14] <snover> thatâ€™s only valid if you donâ€™t consider any language other than English to be valid
[11:39:24] <bittyx-laptop> dabear, Will123456: aw c'mon, moms are awesome, even with their anecdotes and all :P it's the "when i was your age i walked 10 miles through snow, uphill, both ways, just to get to school" story in a different package, have some understanding. in 30 years, your children will maybe be programming in some hyper-modern method that you can't even imagine today, and you'll be like "yeah, i made websites back when i was young" :P
[11:39:56] <sdio> snover: y u h8 FREEDOM?
[11:40:06] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: That tends to be more of a dad category
[11:40:15] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: hey, i use sublime text, and i'm really pleased by it, just sayin'.
[11:40:30] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: that's a bad assumption.
[11:40:30] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: I quite like it, never managed to get any sort of autocomplete going, though.
[11:40:35] <dabear> I will never get laid :(
[11:40:48] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: i use it both on linux and windows since i don't like switching environments
[11:40:58] <sdio> ah, so you use v2?
[11:41:01] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: yup.
[11:41:04] <sdio> I didn't like v2
[11:41:14] <sdio> too much screenspace lost
[11:41:23] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: well it's still in dev, but i really like some features (and i can live without other stuff that's still missing)
[11:41:33] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: wait, what? you can remove everything except for the editor
[11:41:38] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: it's customizable :P
[11:42:03] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood Uncaught [CKEDITOR.editor.replace] The element with id or name ".page" was not found.
[11:42:06] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood any ideas?
[11:42:12] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: true. okay, better question: what do you like about it over 1.x?
[11:42:12] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: though i have both the side bar and the mini map on, and i can see everything i need on a 22" monitor
[11:42:19] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood i have CKEDITOR.replace('.page'); in my <head> section
[11:42:27] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Use the jQuery adapter.
[11:42:29] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: I work on a laptop.
[11:42:44] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood 2 secs
[11:42:47] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: just a few minutes, i gotta make some coffee :D
[11:43:30] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: load up ckeditor/_samples/jqueryadapter.html
[11:45:04] <Whirl3d> other than (space) _ and -  what other characters are safe to use in an element's id?
[11:45:11] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: bittyx-laptop: Did you guys actually purchase a license to use sublime?
[11:45:22] <Whirl3d> *ignore space
[11:45:25] <Whirl3d> lol
[11:45:35] <sdio> DanAKAHollywood: Not yet. I only started using it a couple of weeks ago.
[11:45:54] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: I was curious if it is actually worth the money, it looks pretty slick.
[11:45:59] <sdio> DanAKAHollywood: Not really sure I want to continue to use it.
[11:46:26] <sdio> I use it primarily for python/JS/CSS, never going to give up VS for C/C++/C#.
[11:46:48] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: The problem I run into is that Aptana 3 isn't KDE friends at all and Netbeans is a memory hog after a day or two of use. I have been looking for a valid alternative myself.
[11:47:35] <sdio> DanAKAHollywood: I tried Aptana too, it seemed heavyweight.
[11:48:21] <sdio> If I could get some sort of decent autocomplete, proper auto indent on paste/fix indent working with ST, I'd probably stick to it.
[11:48:41] <sdio> otherwise, right now, its not much better than vim with auto indenting and some syntax highlighting.
[11:49:05] <DanAKAHollywood> sdio: For Rails and large PHP projects it is great. But, being built on Eclipse it is definitely not lightweight at all.
[11:49:30] <Jakey> i just like a nice gutter lines for an IDE
[11:49:30] <sdio> right :/
[11:49:35] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ok
[11:49:38] <Jakey> like notepad++ has
[11:50:09] <Jantire> Anyone here use RoR?
[11:50:28] <lenswipe> janne i was thinking of it
[11:50:37] <lenswipe> Jantire can you reccomend a good RoR editor?
[11:50:38] <DanAKAHollywood> Jakey: I use Notepad++ at work for all of my quick coding. If it had autocomplete it would be stellar. But that is where Editra is supposed to come in and be useful. I haven't messed with Editra too much though.
[11:50:55] <Jantire> lenswipe: Gedit
[11:51:00] <Jakey> DanAKAHollywood, yes. dam right your right
[11:51:58] <sdio> DanAKAHollywood: I'll try editra out.
[11:52:01] <lenswipe> Jantire hmmm dont care for Gedit much
[11:52:04] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'ckeditor' any ideas?
[11:52:15] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Is it online?
[11:52:19] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood sure
[11:52:27] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood lemme go grab my IP for you
[11:52:41] <bittyx-laptop> hey, i'm back
[11:52:48] <skylamer`> Dan Notepad++ haS auto completion :))))))
[11:52:49] <sdio> excellent.
[11:52:56] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood http://95.146.91.2/stpeters2/admin
[11:53:00] <sdio> now we can party it up like it's 1999.
[11:53:25] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: as for sublime text 2, i love the sidebar (it really helps with a lot of files in a project), and the goto anything command is just magic
[11:53:30] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: it's the best thing ever
[11:54:03] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: I tend not to use the mouse at all when coding
[11:54:04] <lenswipe> sdio why are you looking for something "more lightweight"?
[11:54:08] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: autocomplete works great across a lot of files
[11:54:21] <sdio> so i'd have much preferred if I could do some sort of ctrl+num to skip to a specific file
[11:54:23] <lenswipe> sdio unless you're using netbeans to recompile windows seven on a 386 you're not going to really notice too much
[11:54:26] <sdio> instead of having to tab through a bunch.
[11:54:36] <sdio> lenswipe: okay. thanks for your opinion.
[11:54:38] <TomLeyton> hey, trying to look for other solutions for my problem, how can I set a div window to the bottom when receiving a scroll event ?
[11:54:39] <lenswipe> k
[11:54:51] <lenswipe> sdio just suggesting you give it a shot before you dismiss it :p
[11:54:53] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: alt+1, 2, 3, etc. goes through open files
[11:55:01] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: I'm learning so much.
[11:55:15] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: Real men don't read the instructions? That's my excuse, anyway.
[11:55:19] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You aren't including the jquery adapter
[11:55:27] <lenswipe> how do i include it?
[11:55:41] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: What features do you use in v2 that don't exist in v1.x
[11:55:44] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: i haven't read much of the instructions anyway, i think i'm used to the alt+num for switching from somewhere, though i have no idea where
[11:56:01] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: <script type="text/javascript" src="ckeditor/adapters/jquery.js"></script>
[11:56:25] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: i don't remember how good autocomplete was in v1, i use it a lot in v2, and the new goto anything thingy (iirc that didn't exist in v1)
[11:56:25] <DanAKAHollywood> skylamer`: Does it? I wasn't aware.
[11:56:52] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: tbh, i haven't used v1 much; i've tested it for a couple of weeks, and then v2 was released - with linux support, i skipped to it immediately
[11:56:54] <sdio> one thing I hate about it is how find stops working all of a sudden.
[11:57:13] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood yay
[11:57:13] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: i don't know, i haven't encountered anything like that in v2
[11:57:30] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: fortunately, the alt-num hotkey doesn't work in v1
[11:57:31] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood now how do i change the size of it?
[11:57:36] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: so it looks like I'll be switching.
[11:57:39] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: In the config.js
[11:57:39] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: also, i don't remember v1, when you do ctrl+h for replacing for example, do you get a popup window, or just that little menu on the bottom?
[11:57:48] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im using a config array
[11:57:55] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood can i just pass width = blah height = blah
[11:57:57] <Jakey> DanAKAHollywood, not that kind of autocomplete
[11:57:58] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: little menu on the bottom.
[11:58:09] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html#.height
[11:58:34] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: that's something i REALLY love about sublime text - it's so non-intrusive with anything you do - i've used notepad++ previously and once you see the awesome user interface of sublime text, you see how intrusive all the windows are
[11:58:58] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Yea, you would pass height: 'blah', width: 'blah'
[11:59:14] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: def.
[11:59:54] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: you asked about the license, right? i've started using sublime text for a project a few months ago (i heard about it accidentally and decided to check it out); i'm finishing the project in a week or so, and as soon as i get the money, i'll buy the license. i feel it's worth it, even with hundreds of free alternative editors.
[12:00:29] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: I guess I should give it a go then. It is only $59 so what can it hurt.
[12:00:43] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: but i assume that's a matter of preference. i don't mind paying money (and it's not really that expensive) for something that makes my work really comfortable and speedy, compared to other environments i've worked in so far.
[12:00:54] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: exactly.
[12:01:18] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: How does it handle large projects like say, a Symfony project.
[12:01:40] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood if i dont specify a css file to apply to the contents, will it just apply my style.css?
[12:02:12] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: oh, their site specifically says that it's free for demoing; so you can download and work in it for sometime without paying. there's no restrictions really, except for a popup dialog that appears every 20-30 saves or so. they just say that you have to pay if you decide to use it, so download and test it all you want.
[12:02:27] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: v2 is still in production, and they're still fixing things, adding features, etc.
[12:02:58] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: It will apply the default style. You do have to specify a style if you want it to be a true example of the final output.
[12:03:04] <lenswipe> ok
[12:03:12] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: hmm, never used symfony. i'm using codeigniter for this project i've been working on, and everything works great.
[12:03:12] <lenswipe> im having trouble passing the width and height
[12:03:45] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: I will give it a go and check it out.
[12:03:53] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-public-alpha <--- their site says that, for example, the goto anything function handles 50,000+ file projects easily
[12:04:10] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: sure.
[12:04:19] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: hmn, is goto anything supposed to work on functions?
[12:04:40] <sdio> or just files?
[12:04:46] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: 1.4 doesn't run on Linux?!?
[12:04:54] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: goto anything works on *anything*
[12:05:01] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: no, v2 does
[12:05:06] <bittyx-laptop> DanAKAHollywood: try v2, you won't regret it
[12:05:25] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: if you want to find a function, you can search for @function name
[12:05:44] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood nevermind
[12:05:46] <lenswipe> i have it
[12:05:59] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: the example on the site says, that if you search for, say, "tp@rf", that would take you to the function read_file in a file called text_parser.py
[12:06:01] <TomLeyton> paul_irish, you still around?
[12:06:12] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: now that is a killer feature.
[12:06:28] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: just give it a go, once you get used to it, you don't even think about it, you just navigate easily wherever you want to
[12:06:41] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: just did, and it actually worked quite nicely.
[12:06:48] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: So far, quite nice.
[12:07:04] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: how about autocomplete? I can't even get it to autocomplete stuff in the python standard lib..
[12:07:34] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: hmm, i dunno, autocomplete just works for me. don't really remember how it was in v1 though, since, as i've said, i haven't used it much
[12:07:58] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: talking about v2 :/
[12:08:01] <DanAKAHollywood> bittyx-laptop: It shows just how much Netbeans sucks a perserving spacing... All of my files look horrible in Sublime because of that...
[12:08:42] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: that's weird, though i can't help you much with that, since i don't do python :/
[12:09:14] <m0dmd> Whirl3d sup buddy you round
[12:09:17] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: final q, is there some syntax to search * open files for a function? if I'm working on a JS file, it seems to search only functions within that file.
[12:09:32] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: goto anything?
[12:09:56] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: indeed, with goto anything.
[12:10:28] <sdio> bittyx-laptop: @function searches only within the file I am currently viewing.
[12:12:43] <Tant102> How come <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"> seems to add newlines to my posted strings?
[12:16:13] <dub54> does jquery have anyway to merge query strings?
[12:16:16] <Whirl3d> Here's a tough one for y'all:  If I have a scrolling div with named anchors in it and I want to know when an anchor scrolls off the top of the page. How do I do it?
[12:17:26] <DukeDrake> out of focus check ... something?
[12:17:28] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ok i got a problem
[12:17:37] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Yea?
[12:17:42] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im using ckeditor and im passing it my stylesheet so i can see stuff is gonna look like...
[12:18:19] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood problem is ckeditor uses an iframe meaning that the iframe contains <body> meaning that the background to my ckeditor instance is the same colour as the <body> in my actual page....
[12:18:23] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ....which is dark blue
[12:18:35] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood go to edit a page and youll see what i mean
[12:19:10] <Tant102> Cant you give the iframe a class/id? And remove the background?
[12:19:11] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: It is white for me
[12:19:14] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: sorry, had to go for a while. goto anything jumps to a function in a specific file, but there's "find in files" and "find in open files" options if you need those
[12:19:22] <Tant102> #editFrame body { background: none; }
[12:19:43] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood oh yeah sorry - try now
[12:20:11] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Also, you can add resize_enabled: false to disable resizing of the editor. And you can also disable the little collapse arrow just to make it a little more... locked down.
[12:20:13] <vifo> 'n evening folks
[12:20:31] <imsky> wot up vifo
[12:20:32] <bot-t> (114 hours ago) <abjorn> tell imsky I miss him
[12:21:03] <Whirl3d> awwww, that makes my heart wiggle
[12:21:08] * imsky wiggles
[12:21:24] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood done that
[12:21:31] <imsky> can't connect to freenode from my normal irc client
[12:21:36] <imsky> this is bullcrapsky
[12:21:52] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood but yeah, basically i want it apply only the css selectors from within #content, but i dont want to make a seperate stylesheet just for ckeditor
[12:22:01] <vifo> i'm playung around with jQuery.ajax. Now i'd like to get the response data in complete() (as it is passed in success()). Anyhow, I am apparently to stupid :) How can I retrieve the response data in complete() callback (if any)?
[12:22:05] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood neither do i want to start chopping my main stylesheet up and cascading it
[12:22:40] <lenswipe> vifo surely it returns HTTP 200 if it was successful?
[12:23:36] <cooki3s> why does my browser refresh the site when I use $.post? is there another way to use ajax and avoid a refresh?
[12:23:39] <bittyx-laptop> sdio: but seeing as v2 is still a work in progress, you can make a suggestion for something like *@function_name to search through open files. from my experience (reading their forum), it seems that the developers are very open to good/usable suggestions
[12:23:43] <imsky> finally got through
[12:23:45] <vifo> lenswipe: yep, 200 and json data, so i could catch in it complete(), but i'd like to do so in complete() instead, since i'm wrapping it and calling other callbacks
[12:23:47] <imsky> wtf freenode, get your crap together
[12:23:55] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html#.bodyClass
[12:24:04] <imsky> also sup Whirl3d
[12:24:36] <vifo> lenswipe: of course i mean in success() in first place
[12:25:03] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood thats having no effect at all for some reason
[12:25:07] <lenswipe> vifo i dont know then, sorry :(
[12:25:09] <vifo> lenswipe: i'd like to handle all outcome in ONE callback
[12:25:15] <lenswipe> hmm
[12:25:20] <vifo> lenswipe: thanks anyway
[12:27:17] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Did you setup a style for your bodyId?
[12:27:25] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood hmm?
[12:27:29] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood lemme pastebin what i have
[12:27:37] <DanAKAHollywood> Pastebin your CSS?
[12:27:47] <lenswipe> that too?
[12:27:48] <lenswipe> ok
[12:27:52] <vifo> my first thought was, that since a jqXHR object is passed to ajax.complete(), there would be some way to gather response data from the jqXHR. seems though, that i'm not able to get it ... any hints?
[12:28:00] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood heres my js: http://pastebin.com/6uQcLAVJ
[12:28:34] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood http://pastebin.com/8u9W4vb4
[12:28:37] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood theres my CSS
[12:29:53] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Add a background-color to #content
[12:30:12] <lenswipe> are you serious?
[12:30:13] <lenswipe> damn.
[12:31:57] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood can CKEditor do image uploads?
[12:33:14] <DoctorDarren> Can a div be both draggable and droppable?
[12:33:43] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Nope, but if you want that then I can hook you up there too.
[12:34:28] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: http://www.uploadify.com/
[12:34:45] <DanAKAHollywood> DoctorDarren: I don't see why not.
[12:34:55] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood thanks
[12:35:15] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood this is for inline images right?
[12:35:21] <lenswipe> i can use it to upload inline images
[12:35:58] <mipo> how to send li id with $.post?
[12:36:09] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You just use it to upload files and you can customize to fit your needs
[12:36:28] <lenswipe> right.
[12:40:34] <guy> why would this return error navigator.hover is not a function:
[12:40:36] <guy> navigator	= $('div.page > div.nav'); navigator.hover(function(){
[12:43:06] <Moo-_-> guy: navigator is reserved word/object
[12:43:09] <Moo-_-> I guess
[12:44:20] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood its not applying some selectors for some reason
[12:44:45] <mipo> Moo-_-,  how to get li id of ul ?
[12:45:08] <Moo-_-> mipo: easily
[12:45:13] <mipo> how?
[12:45:23] <Moo-_-> mipo: I am not in mood to answer this question
[12:45:23] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood images arent being styled as they should be
[12:45:43] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Let me check it out.
[12:45:52] <mipo> Moo-_-,  Ok
[12:46:07] <Jakey> MOOOO
[12:46:14] <Jakey> cow
[12:46:19] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood if you insert an image it doesnt have the shadow and stuff that it does on the actual page
[12:46:38] <Jakey> holy cow!
[12:46:46] <Jakey> your right lenswipe
[12:46:55] <lenswipe> Jakey ?
[12:47:15] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Are you using a class for the shadows in the display view?
[12:47:27] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood nope im using #content img
[12:47:46] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood since im telling CKEditor to use #content as the base for everything that should apply
[12:48:23] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood on second thoughts, forget it - i have it working now :D
[12:48:53] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Very nice
[12:48:57] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood like it?
[12:49:02] <lenswipe> :D
[12:49:37] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Due to our conversation on CKEditor yesterday, I decided to use it for my editor and just tie my customer toolbars into it.
[12:49:45] <lenswipe> cool
[12:50:05] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Your site is well on its way to being quite amazing now.
[12:50:10] <lenswipe> thanks :D
[12:50:45] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Just stay away from creating a skin for it, it is a pain
[12:51:12] <lenswipe> yeah
[12:51:24] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood is it possible to have useful styles that actually work on the styles menu?
[12:51:52] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Not sure, haven't messed with that.
[12:52:10] <lenswipe> asin something other than "RED TITLE" and "BLUE TITLE"
[12:52:22] <lenswipe> like can i have it use <h3>s and stuff that i actually want
[12:54:05] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I'm sure you can, not entirely sure as to how.
[12:54:11] <lenswipe> hmm
[12:54:23] <lenswipe> thanks for all your help so far anyway
[12:57:09] <mipo> how to alert all li id of a ul?
[12:59:25] <guy> $(document).height() gives way bigger size than the actual document is
[12:59:31] <guy> any ideas as to what is causing it?
[13:02:02] <guy> ah. got it.
[13:05:51] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im creating a pivot table between users and pages to fix a many to  many relationship
[13:06:06] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im worrid about referential integrity though, how can i sort that out?
[13:08:11] <srj55> is there anything like .load()  that instead of loading the entire page into an element, it will load a specific element only into an element?
[13:08:27] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: On the database side?
[13:08:32] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood yes
[13:08:50] <DanAKAHollywood> dump the scheme and paste it
[13:08:56] <DanAKAHollywood> schema*
[13:09:20] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood how do i do that?
[13:09:38] <dub54> can I limit a selector to x amount of characters and hide the others?
[13:09:59] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: mysqldump -u[user] -p [database] > schema.sql
[13:12:47] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood http://pastebin.com/mtzYWX6j
[13:13:30] <DanAKAHollywood> what is the pivot table?
[13:13:40] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood user_pages_xref
[13:16:33] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: What is the table for, user/page relationship?
[13:16:50] <lenswipe> yes
[13:16:56] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You don't need a table for that
[13:17:00] <lenswipe> i dont?
[13:17:14] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: No, just add a constraint on the page table that ties it to the user
[13:17:26] <lenswipe> hmm
[13:17:32] <lenswipe> bear in mind this is for a many to many
[13:18:00] <Renegade001> Has anyone any idea why this won't work
[13:18:00] <Renegade001> (wrapper ? wrapper : document.body).appendChild(elem);
[13:18:01] <lenswipe> i want 1 page to be editable by many users, and many users to be able to edit many pages if that manes sesnse
[13:18:18] <Renegade001> It works in the console but not contained in a script
[13:21:32] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Okay, so you should add a constraint on the page table that ties back to the xref table.
[13:21:45] <lenswipe> how do i do that?
[13:28:00] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: ALTER TABLE [table] ADD CONSTRAINT fk_something FOREIGN KEY([column]) REFERENCES [table]([column]) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELTE CASCADE;
[13:28:58] <lenswipe> do i replace fk_something with my foreign key?
[13:29:13] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You can just call it whatever you want
[13:29:19] <lenswipe> o
[13:29:30] <lenswipe> would i have 2 of those?
[13:29:36] <lenswipe> a foreign key for users and for groups?
[13:30:28] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: If you need integrity for groups then yes. That will cause it to delete the entries from your pivot table when a page was deleted.
[13:30:36] <lenswipe> err
[13:30:38] <lenswipe> not for groups
[13:30:39] <lenswipe> for pages sorry
[13:30:46] <lenswipe> ah ok
[13:30:49] <DanAKAHollywood> No, you just need that one foreign key
[13:31:52] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ALTER TABLE user_pages_xref ADD CONSTRAINT refinteg FOREIGN KEY(page) REFERENCES pages(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELTE CASCADE;
[13:31:54] <lenswipe> like that?
[13:32:43] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: it would be FOREIGN KEY(pageid)
[13:33:01] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood it wouldbe, but i just changed it so its page
[13:33:11] <lenswipe> either way mysql moans about it :<
[13:33:14] <lenswipe> ALTER TABLE [table] ADD CONSTRAINT fk_something FOREIGN KEY([column]) REFERENCES [table]([column]) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELTE CASCADE;
[13:33:16] <lenswipe> ewrr
[13:33:22] <lenswipe> #1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'DELTE CASCADE' at line 1
[13:33:31] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You spelled DELETE wrong
[13:33:36] <guy> I have <ul><li></ul> structure. <li> element has Hover event. How do I select all other LIs but not the one that is hovered?
[13:33:44] <lenswipe> ok thats it
[13:34:18] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood do i need a cascade on insert?
[13:34:27] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Nope
[13:34:29] <lenswipe> ok
[13:34:45] <lenswipe> so if i create a page and assign someone to it, it will be put in there too?
[13:34:47] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: The only time you need relations updated is when you delete or update something
[13:35:48] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You will probably need to create a trigger to do that
[13:35:51] <lenswipe> right
[13:35:58] <lenswipe> is that an SQL related thing too?
[13:36:29] <guy> anyone?
[13:36:56] <stefancrs_> hey, usually I set up my event listeners in $(document).ready(), but if I want to hook listeners up on stuff that gets loaded by ajax, should I do that in the success handler?
[13:38:19] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: It doesn't look like a trigger will do what you need.
[13:38:45] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You will have to handle it in your PHP
[13:39:10] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: The foreign key will just make sure that you don't end up with a bunch of orphaned rows in that table when you delete content
[13:39:20] <Tant102> I'm sending content with 'Content-Type: image/png' and 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="awesome"'. Is there anyway I can get IE to make out the extension itself, or in any way else be able to auto-open the file? Firefox uses the content-type and suggests to open the file in gimp, which is what I want.
[13:39:43] <bittyx-laptop> i'm loading some elements via ajax and appending them to a div. however, before i append them, i want to set them to be hidden, so they wouldn't be displayed immediately when appended, but only later, through calling a separate function (that does some filtering stuff). i'm using the $.get(url, function(data) { ...} ), and in the function, i'm trying $(data).find('.someClass').css('display', 'none'), but it doesn't work. i've also tried .hide()
[13:39:43] <bittyx-laptop> , it's the same. as soon as i do $(data).find('.someClass').appendTo($('#someDiv')), the downloaded content is visible. is there any way to accomplish what i want?
[13:39:59] <guy> I have <ul><li></ul> structure. <li> element has Hover event. How do I select all other LIs but not the one that is hovered?
[13:40:07] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood so when i insert a table i need to insert a row in there too?
[13:40:08] <lenswipe> ok
[13:40:17] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, why not send the newly found content to your method, and add it when it should be displayed?
[13:40:51] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I'm looking at a way to avoid that, give me just a sec
[13:40:55] <lenswipe> thanks
[13:41:09] <djQuery> stefancrs_: either that or take a look at see ?.live
[13:41:09] <bot-t> stefancrs_, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:41:15] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: What version of MySQL are you using?
[13:41:26] <stefancrs_> djQuery: ta!
[13:41:40] <djQuery> stefancrs_: or see ?.delegate
[13:41:41] <bot-t> stefancrs_, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:41:43] <lenswipe> well on my dev server im running  5.1.41-log
[13:41:49] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood lemme check the production server
[13:42:01] <stefancrs_> djQuery: live ought to be slightly less efficient than just hooking it up after I've added it to the DOM, no?
[13:42:10] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: hmm, i haven't thought of that. the thing is, this is a function i use in some other places, and it would be a pain having to rewrite it, or write a separate one - it's basically a updateFilteredItems() function that takes care of what should be hidden and what should be shown (which gets updated by clicking on some tags on the page)
[13:42:59] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood production server is: 5.0.51a-24+lenny5
[13:43:07] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood why?
[13:43:30] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, sounds like you would love http://knockoutjs.com/
[13:43:43] <djQuery> stefancrs_: no necessarily.   .delegate is actualy less overhead that onclick. and it depends on how you write your code. if you have 20 buttons that all do the same thing but based on some attribute of the button .like deleting a row from a table for example
[13:43:55] <bittyx-laptop> is there a way to do what i asked, though? i've thought about appending 'style="display:none"' to my php code, but that seems kind of ugly/hacky
[13:44:10] <djQuery> stefancrs_: http://jsperf.com/jquery-live-vs-jquery-delegate/15
[13:44:12] <stefancrs_> djQuery: aha, will have a look at delegate. heard it mentioned many times.
[13:44:14] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, Add your items to your viewModel, and let them have a simple .IsVisibleShazaam, and use jquery.tmpl to render those that are visible.
[13:45:46] <djQuery> stefancrs_: http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/event-delegation-jquery-performance/
[13:46:27] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, anyhow, it sounds like a simple container.hide().append(items) should work for you.
[13:46:33] <Tant102> And call container.show() later.
[13:46:44] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: that sounds nice, but i doubt i'm gonna learn a new framework just for this simple problem. hmm
[13:47:00] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: okay, here's a live link of the example: http://nsnight.levacic.net/dogadjaji
[13:47:18] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: so you may get a better idea of what/how i'm doing
[13:47:20] <Tant102> You sure are in for some parties.
[13:47:28] <stefancrs_> djQuery: good stuff, thanks!
[13:47:56] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: i can't exactly hide the container, because of the categorized events by dates - if the data downloaded should be put into an already existing date, that could cause problems (hiding the actual container)
[13:48:10] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: i'd just like a way to have the events hidden by default when they are appended
[13:48:35] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, on page load?
[13:48:38] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: the newly downloaded events, that is, not those already on the page
[13:48:47] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: nope, on ajax download
[13:49:15] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: then just apply css to them and then do a .show when neccessary
[13:49:25] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: that's what i'm doing, but it's not working
[13:49:26] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Because certain features are only available in certain versions
[13:49:42] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, define "not working".
[13:49:48] <bittyx-laptop> just a sec, i'll paste some code
[13:50:07] <stefancrs_> bittyx-laptop: you apply css, add to dom, then show later, right?
[13:50:16] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: that's what i'm trying
[13:50:23] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: see ?not working
[13:50:24] <bot-t> bittyx-laptop, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:50:24] <stefancrs_> bittyx-laptop: try adding to dom, apply css, show later?
[13:50:32] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: but it's not working, as in, the css isn't applied before added to the dom
[13:50:36] <djQuery> see ?notworking
[13:50:38] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ok
[13:50:39] <bot-t> djQuery, Issue Queue and jQuery Wiki links not working | jQuery Plugins - The "issue queue" and "jQuery Wiki" links near the bottom of the left hand navigation do not seem to be working. When activated, the links change size and position and the links are not followed af... http://plugins.jquery.com/content/issue-queue-and-jquery-wiki-links-not-working
[13:50:43] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im off for my tea - back shortly
[13:50:47] <stefancrs_> bittyx-laptop: that's why I suggested adding to dom first, then hiding
[13:51:08] <stefancrs_> it seems strange to add stuff before you actually want to show ANY of it though
[13:51:11] <Tant102> Wouldnt that cause a 'flash' of visible content?
[13:51:24] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: exactly, that's why i don't want that
[13:51:26] <stefancrs_> Tant102: yeah, mayube
[13:51:32] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: okay, look at http://nsnight.levacic.net/dogadjaji
[13:51:37] <djQuery> Tant102: not unless u are applying some animation to the hide
[13:51:46] <stefancrs_> hah
[13:51:48] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: at the bottom of the page is a variant of infinite scroll
[13:51:48] <stefancrs_> :)
[13:52:03] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: the thing is, when you click on a tag to filter by categories etc
[13:52:24] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: the infinite scroll div may end up in view, which would cause the download of new events (which is good)
[13:52:26] <stefancrs_> bittyx-laptop: see what djQuery wrote above
[13:53:02] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, yeah, I see what you mean when I filter on "Proslava datuma". There's a flash of content that shouldn't be visible.
[13:53:03] <stefancrs_> bittyx-laptop: btw, is there a good performance reason for downloading events you aren't showing?
[13:53:04] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: yeah, but there's no way to select the newly appended elements
[13:53:08] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: yeah, that
[13:53:15] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: seems to work fine on my machine using chrome
[13:53:30] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: yes, so i wouldn't have to download them again when i click on a different filter
[13:53:40] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: there is a little bit of jump
[13:53:54] <bittyx-laptop> stefancrs_: i've talked with the client and we've decided that the preferred functionality is to download ordered by date
[13:54:26] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: yeah, sometimes some items appear that shouldn't (they disappear immediately, though, but that's not what i want)
[13:55:15] <bittyx-laptop> the ideal would be if i could hide the items before they are appended to the dom
[13:55:43] <bittyx-laptop> i mean, if i don't find another solution, i'll just put style="display:none" in the php that's called by the ajax request, but it seems like an ugly solution/hack
[13:55:45] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: success: function(){  $(data.elems).each(function(i, elm){    $('<div></div>', {text: elm}).appendTo('.content').slideDown();   });  }
[13:55:53] <bittyx-laptop> i'd rather do that in jquery
[13:56:11] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, init.js, rows 267-283, correct?
[13:56:27] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: correct
[13:56:32] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: hmm give me a sec to parse that
[13:56:45] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, instead of .css('display', 'none'), how about just calling .hide()?
[13:56:48] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: .content div {display: none} will prevent any kinda flasing
[13:57:07] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: i've tried .hide() first, and it was the same
[13:58:07] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: i'm not sure i follow? you mean, put that in the css? but then non-javascript users won't be able to see anything? (it's not currently non-javascript friendly, but it will be later)
[13:58:27] <Tant102> bittyx-laptop, uhm. I dont know the dom well enough, but you aren't you adding a child item when calling .appendTo?
[13:58:39] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: well non javascript users wont be able to dynamicaly load items either ?
[13:58:41] <Tant102> So the parent is hidden, but the child get's the new parents visibility?
[13:59:37] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: child nodes get the new parents visibility after calling .appendTo()? that's weird. oh, let me try something
[13:59:52] <xenyz> Is there a limit on the number of document ready functions you can call?
[13:59:53] <Tant102> It's just a style, and the new parent doesnt have the display:none that hide() gives.
[14:00:02] <Renegade001> Is anyone getting a weird error with this?
[14:00:02] <djQuery> nonjs body {}    $(document).reay( fucntion(){$(document.body).removeClass('nonjs');})
[14:00:02] <Renegade001> http://jsfiddle.net/hAK76/1/
[14:00:03] <Tant102> But it seems that you hide the child with your first selector.
[14:00:11] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: as i've said, that's scheduled for a later time (there will be just simple pagination style stuff though)
[14:00:32] <bittyx-laptop> Tant102: yeah, the first selector should give the display:none to the children
[14:00:42] <bittyx-laptop> the second one should hide the date categories
[14:00:50] <Renegade001> Specifically http://pastie.org/1986351
[14:00:58] <Renegade001> I cannot seem to figure out the problem
[14:01:44] <bittyx-laptop> ahh, that fixed it
[14:01:57] <bittyx-laptop> oops, no it didn't
[14:02:28] <zfmf> i have this jqueryui datepicker config, maxdate set to 2012-05-20 but i can choose until 2012-06-20 why this, i want only until 2012-05-20
[14:02:30] <zfmf> http://pastebin.com/iELSQ523
[14:03:26] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: to keep you $(document).reay( fucntion(){$(document.body).removeClass('nonjs').addClass('js');})    This way you basicaly have 2 different styule sheets\namespaces for your js and nonjs browsers.       .nonjs .content div {display: block; } .js .content div { display: none; }  do its not like what I was sayin would cause you issues later when you wanted those pesky non js browsers to work
[14:04:58] <m0dmd> Whirl3d how was home depot last night
[14:05:13] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: hmm, that seems like a usable idea. but i've found another way of solving this particular problem.
[14:05:31] <bittyx-laptop> i'm doing ...appendTo(...).hide().children('.itemSmall').hide();
[14:05:34] <bittyx-laptop> that seems to work
[14:05:44] <bittyx-laptop> i just have a problem with my infinite scroll now
[14:05:49] <bittyx-laptop> dunno why :S
[14:07:01] <bittyx-laptop> ohh, it seems the .appear() plugin doesn't do another check after the function called has finished. well that seems like a bug
[14:07:51] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im back
[14:08:09] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood i love how this is #jquery and we're discussing MySQL lol
[14:11:16] <m0dmd> help is help, no matter how you put it.
[14:11:31] <lenswipe> m0dmd ?
[14:12:04] <|RicharD|> anybody here had used the jquery image panning plugin ? http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-image-panning
[14:12:36] <m0dmd> lenswipe it's good that you got MySQL help here :)
[14:14:49] <m0dmd> |RicharD| i'm sure if you follow the basic tut, your questions will get answered :)
[14:15:07] <|RicharD|> you use this ?
[14:15:18] <m0dmd> nope, have not found a need to
[14:15:37] <m0dmd> we all use jquery
[14:15:43] <m0dmd> :p
[14:17:29] <|RicharD|> in every case i fixed it :)
[14:17:35] <|RicharD|> but the problem was on my css :)
[14:17:41] <|RicharD|> but thx in every case :).
[14:18:39] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I'm working diligently on the issue. You need to use InnoDB on your tables.
[14:18:59] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood i thought that might be the case
[14:19:04] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: InnoDB is a transactional storage engine that is required for the foreign keys.
[14:19:24] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You also need a foreign key on your xref tying back to the users table
[14:19:35] <lenswipe> ok
[14:19:38] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: That way if you delete a user, it will delete from your xref
[14:19:43] <lenswipe> yeah
[14:22:05] <m0dmd> I'd really recommend reading the MySQL documentation!
[14:22:29] <m0dmd> and loading a test environment with MySQL so you can play with the command line.
[14:23:06] <m0dmd> Whirl3d you round
[14:24:08] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I was thinking that you may be able to use a stored procedure and a trigger for the xref but I can't see how we could pass both the pageId and the userId to the procedure.
[14:24:34] <Edler> when you have multiple elements that have the same id on a page what problem does it cause css and js wise ?
[14:25:24] <m0dmd> Edler I know my js was not working at all during that situation.
[14:25:32] <m0dmd> Edler no errors, just didn't work.
[14:25:38] <Edler> hmmm
[14:25:43] <m0dmd> Edler but if you want to use multiple ele, use class
[14:25:47] <lenswipe> Edler to start with its invalid
[14:25:50] <Edler> yes i understand that
[14:25:56] <Edler> but because id is faster in execution
[14:26:00] <Edler> cause it uses native code
[14:26:04] <lenswipe> huh?!
[14:26:12] <Edler> yes i know it's invalid
[14:26:15] <Edler> but like if you do
[14:26:26] <Edler> $("#div1 #myid")
[14:26:28] <Edler> and
[14:26:31] <Edler> $("#div2 #myid")
[14:26:40] <Edler> even though there are 2 elements who have id = myid
[14:26:43] <Edler> it will select them properly
[14:26:49] <Edler> in css it will also apply styles properly
[14:26:52] <lenswipe> whereas .myid wont?
[14:26:54] <Edler> even though it's invalid
[14:27:00] <m0dmd> Edler, i can't say there is a noticeable differece between using class and id
[14:27:03] <m0dmd> in speed.
[14:27:11] <lenswipe> m0dmd i was about to say that
[14:27:17] <Edler> no it will, i know classes, but i'm curious about the id case
[14:27:18] <lenswipe> unless you're benchmarking it you wouldnt notice
[14:27:25] <Edler> well getElementById is native code
[14:27:27] <Edler> in browsers
[14:27:35] <lenswipe> right
[14:27:36] <Edler> getElementsByClassName needs to be interpreted
[14:27:37] <m0dmd> that's native js, this is jQuery :p
[14:27:46] <m0dmd> jQuery baby!
[14:27:55] <guy> anyone is well familiar with http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/?
[14:27:57] <lenswipe> Edler all js needs to be interpreted
[14:27:58] <m0dmd> lenswipe 2 minds better than 1?
[14:28:03] <Edler> jquery is a javascript library :P
[14:28:16] <m0dmd> Edler and you're worrying about the speed of using id and class rofl
[14:28:18] <lenswipe> Edler unless you're sitting doing js in binary ...
[14:28:23] <guy> how do I activate slide running ONLY when user has hovered the slide-screen?
[14:28:26] <Edler> lol
[14:28:34] <m0dmd> build your application, get it running then optimize from there
[14:28:34] <Edler> well building faster applications is better
[14:28:43] <m0dmd> you don't build fast applications at the beginning
[14:28:45] <m0dmd> you make them faster.
[14:28:48] <Edler> i see
[14:28:56] <m0dmd> also, depends on hardware too
[14:28:56] <Edler> cause i'm having many modules
[14:28:58] <Edler> display on 1 page
[14:29:04] <Edler> i don't want their javascripts to interfere
[14:29:11] <Edler> i want each to run in it's own scope on the page
[14:29:24] <Edler> but the developers might be fucked up and name the same id for some element
[14:29:34] <m0dmd> so use a namespace for your stuff
[14:29:52] <Edler> guy: cool
[14:29:59] <Edler> how ?
[14:30:01] <Edler> js or html wise ?
[14:30:13] <m0dmd> rofl id="edl_thisID"
[14:30:16] <guy> what? js wise of course.
[14:30:37] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Almost got it
[14:30:37] <m0dmd> or make sure you hire good developers!
[14:30:44] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ok
[14:30:53] <Edler> lol
[14:31:00] <Edler> developers can be anywhere aroudn the world
[14:31:03] <Edler> and anyone can write a module
[14:31:06] <m0dmd> that's location.
[14:31:09] <Edler> and anyone can combine any module
[14:31:11] <Edler> i don't hire them
[14:31:21] <Edler> so i can't manage that
[14:31:26] <guy> anyone is well familiar with http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/?
[14:31:27] <guy> how do I activate slide running ONLY when user has hovered the slide-screen?
[14:31:28] <m0dmd> edler, why are other developers coding on your app anyways!
[14:31:28] <Edler> but i must find a way to make sure they can't break each other
[14:31:34] <Edler> not my apps
[14:31:40] <Edler> i'm providing them a framework
[14:31:42] <m0dmd> a developer can break anything they want!
[14:31:46] <Edler> so they code their apps
[14:31:49] <Edler> with limited access
[14:31:54] <Edler> but they have access to js
[14:31:56] <m0dmd> build separate systems for each of them
[14:31:58] <Edler> and limited php access
[14:32:02] <m0dmd> this way, they can't break others code.
[14:32:05] <Edler> yes but how do you build a seperate system for html
[14:32:13] <m0dmd> give them separate files and include those files.
[14:32:19] <Edler> if someone did <div id="title">
[14:32:31] <Edler> and someone in another file decided to put <div id="title">
[14:32:34] <m0dmd> Create a list of global ids
[14:32:38] <m0dmd> And send the list out to all of them!
[14:32:39] <m0dmd> :)
[14:32:54] <Edler> there are no global ids :)
[14:32:59] <m0dmd> Because you make them :)
[14:33:13] <m0dmd> Or the correct term, preserved IDS
[14:33:14] <Edler> what i thought of doing was
[14:33:22] <mdel> man irssi is sweet
[14:33:25] <Edler> a layer on top of jquery
[14:33:31] <Edler> so that when someone calls $("something")
[14:33:33] <Edler> it will call
[14:33:40] <Edler> $("#hisapp something")
[14:33:40] <m0dmd> edler i hope you're making 1000's of dollars from this
[14:33:50] <Edler> yes i am
[14:33:56] <m0dmd> in a couple of days
[14:33:58] <m0dmd> :p
[14:34:03] <Edler> well it's my company
[14:34:04] <Edler> hehe
[14:34:10] <m0dmd> hiring?
[14:34:17] <Edler> you mean hiring people ?
[14:34:24] <Edler> no but i subcontract
[14:34:35] <m0dmd> i fired my last service provider
[14:34:45] <Edler> providing what services ?
[14:34:56] <m0dmd> Edler PM
[14:35:02] <Edler> kk
[14:36:02] <djQuery> edler
[14:36:29] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Got it
[14:36:43] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood :o
[14:36:51] <DanAKAHollywood> Let's go PM
[14:37:03] <Edler> djquery: yea ?
[14:38:11] <djQuery> was trying to catch up on conver thought I had hit ctrl+f before typin name
[14:38:54] <Edler> lol
[14:40:45] <DoctorDarren> Hey, I have a draggable with a snap, but snap seems to ignore the draggable's margin and snap to the div itself. Cn I make snap recognise margins?
[14:50:05] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[14:53:37] <D-Roch> Hi
[14:54:18] <wkmanire> D-Roch: Hello.
[15:06:59] <ale_> hello
[15:07:22] <ale_> why if I have this: $("#dialog-form").dialog("open"); the dialog is not opening??
[15:07:44] <DoctorDarren> Can I get a selector by matching id AND class?
[15:08:10] <wkmanire> DoctorDarren: You can, but you should not have more than one element in the DOM with the same ID.
[15:08:34] <DoctorDarren> wkmanire: Oh okay then, will try to rectify that, thanks
[15:09:53] <wkmanire> ale_: Call $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog() first.
[15:10:27] <wkmanire> ale_: Then call $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );
[15:11:26] <Will123456> anyone have any experience with the jquery threedots plugin?
[15:11:45] <ale_> wkmanire: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ettnu/ ?
[15:12:13] <wkmanire> DoctorDarren: Np, generally speaking you can smash together selectors to create a more specific selector. element#ID.className[attributeX=someValue]:first  and on and on and on
[15:13:38] <wkmanire> ale_: Looks correct
[15:13:58] <ale_> wkmanire: but it's not working! this is strange
[15:14:11] <wkmanire> ale_: Gimme a sec and I'll work up a demo in that fiddle of yorus.
[15:14:13] <wkmanire> yours*
[15:14:55] <ale_> wkmanire: ok, ..I used the one of jqueryui, but not as a button, as a link
[15:15:57] <wkmanire> ale_: No problem, I'll jQuery-ui set up in a fiddle.
[15:17:11] <ale_> wkmanire: thanks mate!
[15:18:42] <wkmanire> ale_: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/2TrdP/
[15:18:54] <wkmanire> Check the info section in the accordion and look at the resources.
[15:18:58] <wkmanire> I'll set up your demo now.
[15:19:43] <ale_> Ok
[15:21:59] <wkmanire> ale_: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/2TrdP/1/
[15:22:06] <wkmanire> Here is a working demo.
[15:22:32] <wkmanire> The first call to dialog initializes the jQuery-UI dialog widget and attaches it to that DIV element.
[15:22:44] <wkmanire> The second call executes the "show" method causing it to be displayed.
[15:22:44] <ale_> wkmanire: and how would you do it with a <a> elementy?
[15:23:08] <wkmanire> I may be mistaken, but the dialog widget is intended to be called on block elements.
[15:23:31] <ale_> so there's no way to make it as a link?
[15:23:34] <clockwize> can i replace an element with another one easily? like in exactly the same position etc
[15:23:45] <wkmanire> ale_: I tested it with an anchor and it still worked.
[15:24:33] <wkmanire> clockwize: It is easy to replace an element but the DOM is going to get reflowed, so the dimensions, border, margin and display type have to be an exact match if you don't want any layout changes.
[15:24:38] <ale_> RIGHT
[15:24:41] <ale_> It works' let me try it
[15:24:58] <clockwize> well, i just want to take an element, wrap a div around it reall
[15:25:01] <clockwize> really*
[15:25:55] <wkmanire> clockwize: You're probably going to want to use a combination of $.detach() and $.append()
[15:27:33] <clockwize> thanks
[15:27:34] <wkmanire> clockwize: Something like get the parent node of the element you want to wrap, create the wrapping div, detach the element you want to wrap and append it to the wrapping div, then insert the wrapping div back into the parent node at the same index.
[15:28:26] <ale_> wkmanire: maybe it's not detecting it because I have: result.append('<a id='sendMessage'>Send Message</a>'); and then I make the $( "#sendMessage" ).click( function () {.... ???
[15:28:34] <mloskot> Folks, could anyone clarify the following statement in http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works#Complete_Example
[15:28:37] <mloskot> "Also, while the custom script is included in the <head>, it is generally preferable to place it in a separate file..."
[15:28:54] <mloskot> AFAIS, there is no script in <head>
[15:28:55] <wkmanire> ale_: Can you set up that fiddle up to better approximate your situation?
[15:29:43] <wkmanire> mloskot: You know how you can put javascript into an HTML document inside of <script> tags?
[15:30:01] <wkmanire> mloskot: THose <script> tags can be children of the <head> element or of the <body> element.
[15:30:17] <wkmanire> mloskot: But a <script> tag can also link in code from a javascript file directly.
[15:30:23] <wkmanire> That is what it is talking about
[15:30:27] <mloskot> wkmanire, Yes, I do know about what you are saying.
[15:31:15] <mloskot> wkmanire, simply, I assumed "the custom script" means this particular script presented in this example
[15:31:20] <kybalion> whats up
[15:36:21] <ale_> wkmanire: this is very strange....I placed an alert inside the $("#sendMessage").click(function(e) { and it's not detecting it!!!
[15:41:21] <wkmanire> ale_: Theres really no such thing as "it doesn't detect it" in javascript.
[15:41:32] <wkmanire> ale_: Odds are you are not reaching that line of code.
[16:01:18] <gigamonkey> I seem to be having trouble with css() not returning correct values. If I have a rule in my own stylsheet which applies to the elements I'm selecting with jQuery, should css() return the values from those rules?
[16:04:50] <gigamonkey> This is in Chrome with 1.6.1 FWIW.
[16:26:54] <ssfsam> what does .attr() do

[16:54:37] <shankysv87> hey there. i'm having trouble with an ajax fancybox popup. perhaps some tips.
[16:54:55] <shankysv87> i have a popup loading a .php upload script to upload images.
[16:55:42] <shankysv87> i'm trying to pass the information for the direct location back to the original page. any thoughts.
[16:56:29] <shankysv87> i figured an array can be passed across the pages, but this isn't working out so well as my php is rusty at best.
[16:56:49] <shankysv87> could i ajax the pop as a div from the same file so its not actually going to another file?
[16:57:01] <shankysv87> but otherwise won't show on the page?
[16:58:02] <coldhead> if you use a modal like
[16:58:04] <coldhead> ?modal
[16:58:04] <bot-t> There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[16:58:17] <coldhead> that should be "in page"
[16:58:41] <coldhead> and if you need to go between the pages you can store it in a cookie
[16:58:47] <coldhead> ?cookie
[16:58:48] <bot-t> coldhead, Cookie | jQuery Plugins - A simple, lightweight utility plugin for reading, writing and deleting cookies. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[16:59:22] <shankysv87> i don't "need" to go between pages. it just looks better as a popup from fancy box, otherwise it should be hidden in some way.
[17:00:02] <coldhead> try some of the modal demos above and see if you like them any
[17:00:02] <shankysv87> and from what i can tell the only way fancybox will work correctly with my setup is by loading the external page (on same domain)
[17:00:11] <shankysv87> ok thanks for the tip.
[17:02:06] <coldhead> shankysv87: you sound like me pizza delivery guy :)
[17:04:34] <shankysv87> you know what ya talking aboot eh? i disagree
[17:04:37] <shankysv87> lol jk
[17:04:50] <shankysv87> (canadian impression)
[17:05:09] <shankysv87> unless your pizza delivery guy is canadian. then i forfeit

[17:14:20] <ShawnRisk> I am using the jquery cycle plugin from malsup.com and when I click on the thumbnail, the description was is the image alt text is not changing, how do I make this change?
[17:22:17] <|RicharD|> how i can in easy way
[17:22:22] <|RicharD|> add and remove html content into a div ?
[17:22:27] <|RicharD|> append and ?
[17:24:49] <coldhead> $('div').html('new content');
[17:25:08] <coldhead> $('div').html('') // no content
[17:26:02] <coldhead> var content = $('div').html(); content = 'new' + content + 'aids'; $('div').html(content);
[17:26:09] <snover> HEY COLDHEAD
[17:26:15] <coldhead> |RicharD|: ^^
[17:26:26] <coldhead> HEY SNOVER WHAT THE FUCK
[17:26:37] <snover> HEY THANKS BRO, WHAT THE FUCK TO YOU TOO
[17:26:56] <|RicharD|> i tried
[17:26:58] <|RicharD|> with
[17:27:05] <|RicharD|> 				$("#container_imgbig").html('<img id="img_casting" src="/<?php echo $products['Product']['dir_spinning'].'/'.$products['Product']['filename_spinning']; ?>" height="201px" width="3000px" class="panning">'); but it give me error
[17:27:14] <|RicharD|> maybe problem with '... sure :D
[17:27:18] <|RicharD|> fixing it :P
[17:27:57] <|RicharD|> any suggest for the ' problem ?
[17:28:32] <ShawnRisk> I am using the jquery cycle plugin from http://malsup.com/Â and when I click on the thumbnail, the description which is the image alt text is not changing but image does. How do I make this change?
[17:30:52] <coldhead> what is the problem, |RicharD| ? the code i pasted works
[17:30:58] <coldhead> what error do you see?
[17:31:14] <|RicharD|> not show
[17:31:16] <|RicharD|> well the page
[17:31:21] <|RicharD|> i think for the tag problems
[17:32:30] <coldhead> try to do things more simple, |RicharD|
[17:32:31] <ShawnRisk> maybe you should check tags that is what most of my problems are in jQuery
[17:32:37] <coldhead> separate your JS and your PHP
[17:32:41] <ShawnRisk> yep
[17:32:51] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: any thoughts on my problem?
[17:33:44] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: maybe it doesn't cycle the other attributes
[17:34:22] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: want to see an example?
[17:34:23] <coldhead> you should check the source
[17:34:29] <coldhead> see if it does
[17:34:34] <coldhead> and see if you can add it if it doesn't
[17:34:36] <coldhead> that's what i'd do
[17:34:49] <coldhead> have a look at the source yourself first, then we can talk about examples
[17:36:21] <ShawnRisk> The description does cycle
[17:36:27] <ShawnRisk> I know that
[17:36:41] <ShawnRisk> just when I click the thumbnail it doesn't change
[17:36:59] <ShawnRisk> how I know it cycles is when I hover over it shows the correct description
[17:37:08] <|RicharD|> not put the content
[17:37:10] <|RicharD|> with: $("#container_imgbig").html('asd');
[17:38:11] <ShawnRisk> |RicharD|: pardon?
[17:39:55] <|RicharD|> nothing it work :)
[17:40:09] <|RicharD|> the problem is that i'm using a panning image plugin
[17:40:21] <|RicharD|> but when i switch
[17:40:32] <|RicharD|> and change image it not work properly(the panning image plugin)
[17:40:39] <ShawnRisk> oh okay
[17:41:04] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: not sure what else I can tell you unless you want to see the code
[17:42:16] <coldhead> sure, let's look at the code
[17:42:23] <coldhead> you too, |RicharD|
[17:42:46] <coldhead> show us the code that makes it to your browser, not all the PHP stuff
[17:42:50] <coldhead> this isn't ##php
[17:42:56] <|RicharD|> yes i know :)
[17:43:02] <|RicharD|> now i work for a workaround
[17:43:05] <|RicharD|> and fuck the problem :)
[17:43:24] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: do you want jquery cycle plugin code or what makes the slider come up?
[17:43:55] <coldhead> a working demo with everything, ShawnRisk :)
[17:44:12] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: I can just send you the link is that okay?
[17:44:23] <coldhead> sure

[17:47:30] <KimRoen> Hi there!
[17:47:46] <KimRoen> Does anyone here have 3 seconds?
[17:48:07] <ShawnRisk> yes
[17:48:13] <KimRoen> Great
[17:48:14] <KimRoen> http://senjatre.no/tjenester/
[17:48:17] <snover> timeâ€™s up
[17:48:21] <KimRoen> ^^
[17:48:37] <KimRoen> I'm getting an error here with both my js-files
[17:48:45] <KimRoen> It seems to think it's an html-file
[17:49:02] <KimRoen> But on the front page it loads fine
[17:49:02] <KimRoen> http://senjatre.no/
[17:49:15] <shankysv87> coldhead: i've ran into another problem with the modal thing you were talking about. got it to work to an extent, however, since the page that is running the script is ajax .load()ed into the div, on form submit, it wants to reload the entire page. no good. but i think i may ahve found another ajax load without page refresh.
[17:49:28] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: i am seeing the alt attribute being cycled...
[17:50:33] <shankysv87> so i have top level page .load() content into div, div content is popup-ing a box where the form that it needs to submit is.  upon submit, it wants to reload the top level page.
[17:51:05] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: did you click the thumbnail and did the description change?
[17:51:10] <KimRoen> This occurred after running the build-script from the html5 boilerplate. I'm loading the unminified versions now, but it didn't make a difference
[17:53:58] <coldhead> oh it's just when you click? k
[17:54:41] <ShawnRisk> yes
[17:58:28] <Draconisle> Hi Guys
[17:58:46] <jrockjiggz> hi
[17:58:46] <Draconisle> Question about the .unload handler
[17:59:14] <Draconisle> is there anyway to give the user the ability to choose if they really want to leave
[17:59:31] <Draconisle> I have a map that might have unsaved changes
[17:59:47] <Draconisle> I want to give the user to keep working if they realized they have unsaved changes
[18:00:29] <Draconisle> I want to give the user "the option" to keep working if they are notified that they have unsaved changes
[18:00:44] <KimRoen> snover: Do you have idea?
[18:00:50] <KimRoen> snover: any*
[18:01:57] <coldhead> this is an unbelievable amount of html to pick through, ShawnRisk
[18:02:01] <coldhead> it makes me feel terribly tired
[18:02:49] <snover> KimRoen: which files exactly?
[18:03:13] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: okay sorry
[18:03:39] <coldhead> i think i nearly got a nasty little fix, ShawnRisk
[18:03:41] <coldhead> hang in there
[18:03:47] <KimRoen> snover:  I've been changing them around, but right now it's the plugins.old.js and script.old.js
[18:03:48] <snover> KimRoen: if you are referring to the last two scripts, you need to be using absolute paths, not relative ones (add a slash)
[18:04:00] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: thanks
[18:04:37] <snover> KimRoen: if you want to know why they are returning html, i have no idea. probably a 404 handler.
[18:04:45] <KimRoen> snover: And that's why it works on the front page, right?
[18:04:51] <snover> KimRoen: yes
[18:04:52] <diegoviola> hi
[18:05:06] <diegoviola> i need to be able to add a <div> dynamically, when a user clicks on a <a> link, does jquery has something for that please?
[18:05:35] <KimRoen> snover: I guess me or someone else will need to change the build script to account for that
[18:06:49] <KimRoen> snover: And that works perfectly. See? This is why I love you.
[18:06:54] <diegoviola> anyone please?
[18:07:34] <Anitox> $('a').click(function(){$(this).append('<div/>');});
[18:07:44] <diegoviola> Anitox: thanks
[18:07:51] <Draconisle> also
[18:08:03] <Draconisle> you can use .live if your <a> are dynamic
[18:08:14] <Anitox> or .delegate
[18:08:18] <shankysv87> goodnight all, thanks for the information.
[18:08:18] <diegoviola> <a> is not dynamic
[18:10:19] <Draconisle> anyone know how to use .unload?
[18:11:06] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/396896/
[18:11:08] <Anitox> examples on: http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[18:11:15] <Draconisle> yes i know that
[18:11:26] <Draconisle> but I want to give the user a cancel ability
[18:11:26] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: how you add that to the page is a matter for yourself, but it worked when i pasted it in the console
[18:11:36] <Draconisle> so that the can stay on the page if they have unsaved changes
[18:11:52] <Draconisle> they*
[18:11:55] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: let me try
[18:12:01] <Anitox> $.unload(function(){ return confirm("are you sure?"); });
[18:13:05] <__Pepr> evening everyone. Can someone please enlightment me about the whole cross-domain issue with Javascript. I am aware of SOP and that JSON/JSONP are methods or getting around the restriction. My question is, is there one approach in the jQuery world that can be used successfully, that does not require a JSON proxy method, or flash method, etc. I am looking for a simple solution that is commonly used. Thanks in advance.
[18:13:45] <Draconisle> that didnt work
[18:13:47] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: the problem is that I have to click twice on some slides to get the right descriptions.
[18:13:53] <Anitox> __Pepr, use GET
[18:14:06] <Draconisle> looks like it didnt care about the result from confirm
[18:14:16] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: that shouldn't be -- didn't happen for me
[18:14:32] <coldhead> you maybe wanna try adding a setTimeout?
[18:14:48] <coldhead> give it half a second to update maybe?
[18:15:29] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/396899/
[18:15:35] <__Pepr> Anitox: so using the $.get method will allow me to retrieve and XML file from another domain without having to have a json proxy somewhere to translate it to JSON?
[18:16:24] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: or possibly add that whole .live() thing inside a setTimeout so it is added after everything else on the page, to ensure that your .live() stuff runs last when a click happens?
[18:16:46] <Anitox> GET will just retreive data... specify parameters in the URL.
[18:16:48] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: trying
[18:18:48] <__Pepr> Anitox: but I was under the impression that browser will not allow a script to GET anything that is not in the same domain. So you are saying that  I can GET a XML file and parse it's content from another domain with no issues on trigger the SOP ( same origin policy ) on browsers. That would be stellar if that was the case.
[18:18:49] <bittyx-laptop> Anitox: that is not true.
[18:18:56] <bittyx-laptop> Anitox: ajax request are subject to same-domain policy
[18:19:03] <bittyx-laptop> Anitox: which is enforced by the browser
[18:19:24] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: the usual approach is to make a php proxy on your own domain
[18:19:37] <Anitox> I can setup a script to return data for parameters in the URL, then I can use any domain to access that URL, specifying the parameters, and it'll return my data
[18:19:41] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: basically, just send the ajax request to your own page, e.g. mysite.com/php-proxy/
[18:20:02] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: and then php-proxy should be passed (e.g. via POST) the url you actually want
[18:20:13] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: the proxy then retrieves the page with curl, and passes it back
[18:20:16] <Anitox> Use it like you're just requesting a page, not like you're POSTing data...
[18:20:16] <coldhead> the usual approach is to develop facebook apps
[18:20:26] <coldhead> and let facebook deal with it
[18:20:50] <Anitox> fecebook
[18:20:52] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: I think this is working.  There are two other problems
[18:21:02] <coldhead> oh no :(
[18:21:08] <__Pepr> Thanks bittyx-laptop and Anitox. I am aware of the php proxy method ,are either of you aware of methods that do not require a php proxy.
[18:21:20] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: i dunno, a python proxy?
[18:21:40] <stackoverflow> who can help me with a cookie  ?
[18:21:43] <__Pepr> lol, nice :)
[18:21:53] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: sorry.
[18:21:54] <__Pepr> I should said, any proxy for that matter.
[18:22:33] <bittyx-laptop> Anitox: read this: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[18:22:36] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: 1.) I think that if I hover over the image and the slider shows up, sometimes when I move the mouse away I can't close the slider.   I am not sure why.
[18:22:39] <bittyx-laptop> Anitox: read the Additional Notes:
[18:22:39] <coldhead> lol bittyx-laptop
[18:23:14] <stackoverflow> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/RXJ3n/4/ <<<<< i have to add a cookie that register if the box is hidden or not
[18:23:16] <__Pepr> I was hoping to find a solution that uses javascript and other technologies ( client side script like ) and not server side assisted.
[18:23:32] <bittyx-laptop> __Pepr: i know, i'm just kidding. i don't personally know of other working solutions, but they may be some
[18:24:09] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: that sounds difficult to reproduce and possibly a bug in cycle... your application looks okay (apart from the 4 billion lines of html)
[18:25:18] <hever> How do I apply the next only for the first result of my selector? window.$("td:contains('sometext')").next().text().replace(/\s\s+/g, ' ')
[18:25:20] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: okay one last thing, how do I make it so when the slider slides int position on slow browsers this is not shown until it reaches the bottom of the slideshow?
[18:25:42] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: you could MAYBE bind to hover everything else on the page and close the thumbs panel if its open... that is awful thougj
[18:25:59] <ShawnRisk> yep it is
[18:26:15] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: you probably want to use .load() but i;'m not sure which elements you want to load on
[18:26:19] <coldhead> i'm getting breakfast
[18:26:22] <coldhead> GOOD LUCK

[18:30:20] <Draconisle> Hi Guys
[18:30:52] <Draconisle> I have tried using .unload
[18:31:11] <Draconisle> but it was warning my users but not providing the option to cancel
[18:31:14] <Draconisle> so I tried this one
[18:31:16] <Draconisle> window.onbeforeunload = function() {return "You have unsaved changes on this page.";}
[18:31:29] <Draconisle> However, it is still triggered on page refreshes
[18:31:41] <Draconisle> I guess that would make sense
[18:31:57] <Draconisle> but is there a way to prevent it from triggering on screen refresh?
[18:33:55] <Draconisle> anyone?
[18:34:24] <Draconisle> I might reuse the onbeforeunload for other things, not just warning of unsaved changes

[19:31:57] <ale_> Hello, I have a strange problem. When I have an div.append('<div id="click">Click here</div>') and then I have a function $('#click').click(func..... it does not work, it's not entering the event, or something like that...why can this be?
[19:33:43] <ale_> Any idea guys?
[19:34:41] <coldhead> ?live @ ale_
[19:34:42] <bot-t> ale_, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[19:35:27] <normelton> snover: i seem to remember some whizbang framework in the last few months that did something like that
[19:36:28] <normelton> my use case would be creating logic for loading JSON data from a URL, then passing it to a "div" object to be parsed and loaded into the div
[19:36:39] <normelton> basically the DIV would just have a callback that accepted the data and populated itself
[19:38:18] <normelton> maybe i could store the function using .data("callback", function(data) { ... })
[19:39:04] <snover> normelton: if by last few months you mean 2005
[19:39:16] <snover> prototype attached methods to dom elements
[19:39:29] <normelton> snover: right, i used prototype for quite a while
[19:39:37] <snover> it was not a good thing.
[19:39:44] <normelton> i seem to remember something recent that seemed more eloquent than that
[19:40:01] <ale_> coldhead: nop..it's not working :(
[19:40:12] <snover> dom elements are host objects. messing with them directly is not a great idea unless you really really know what you are doing.
[19:41:19] <ale_> coldhead: sorry, it's working, just a problem of mine
[19:46:24] <JoeHazzers> anyone come across issues where if something has a hover() handler, i hover over it, it gets animated, then i can right-click, move my mouse away and then focus on the page again, all with the element left in the hovered state?
[19:48:15] <JoeHazzers> whoops, updated jquery, problem fixed.
[19:50:53] <amh345> is there a way to have a function work with 2 separate classes so i dont have to define $('.class_1')  and $('class_2') >

[19:51:08] <ok> hey
[19:54:50] <coldhead> amh345: $('.class_1, .class_2')
[19:54:55] <coldhead> the same as in CSS
[19:56:07] <amh345> oh man. heh. thanks.
[20:01:32] <ale_> how can I change the "Create an account" and "Cancel" buttons from the jqueryui modal-form
[20:01:37] <ale_> ?
[20:05:23] <ZeuZ> How can I do that a scripts polls through AJAX after some X time?
[20:05:34] <ZeuZ> I'm trying to develop a "chat-like" thingy
[20:07:05] <ZeuZ> I can submit the message that's no biggie, however, I know Facebook uses the Comet protocol for it's chat, I know I wouldn't even dare to implement that, but I'd like my script to check the server for new stuff after, say, 5 seconds
[20:07:49] <ZeuZ> I've also seen "hackish" things like this: http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/autofresh.shtml
[20:14:37] <nlogax> welcome felo
[20:15:30] <felo> nlogax: how you doing man! here having trouble with a simple data-attribute field man.
[20:16:04] <tbranyen> dude
[20:17:03] <felo> nlogax: is there such a thing like a fiddle but with server side support ?
[20:17:40] <felo> is there a support site like jsfiddle but with server support for php?
[20:17:54] <nlogax> felo: there is codepad.org , it will run stuff but not much else
[20:18:42] <felo> does it support html and javascript ?
[20:42:22] <amirite> does ajax allow for server-side compression ?
[20:43:00] <coldhead> usually!
[20:43:27] <coldhead> if the browser and the server support it it should happen transparently
[20:44:13] <amirite> so if i instruct my server to spit back gzipped html served via ajax, when i see it in jquery it'll be uncompressed
[20:44:45] <coldhead> if the server is sending the right headers, yes
[20:47:54] <ale_> If I am receiving this as JSON: {"results":{"id":"1"... how would you show it on an alert?
[20:48:17] <coldhead> ?alert
[20:48:17] <bot-t> Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[20:48:38] <ale_> I mean alert( data.results.id??
[20:49:01] <coldhead> if you have function(data) then yes
[20:49:07] <coldhead> hopefully
[20:50:51] <ale_> I have this: coldhead: http://pastebin.com/kfYGXtkS
[20:52:02] <coldhead> i would do a console.log(data)  before the each to ensure that data has a) something and b) something objecty, not just a string
[20:53:07] <ale_> coldhead: because the problem is that it writes me [object Object]
[20:53:48] <coldhead> console.log(data) should give you an entry in the console you can click on to inspect
[20:53:54] <coldhead> but object sounds like it is the right thing
[20:54:24] <ale_> coldhead: so how can I show it correctly?
[20:54:42] <coldhead> ?p @ ale_
[20:54:42] <bot-t> ale_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:54:54] <coldhead> get it up in jsfiddle with the complete json and we'll make it work
[20:55:07] <ale_> coldhead: ok!
[20:55:14] <coldhead> alert(data.results.id) /should/ show "1" off of what you have shown me so far
[20:56:06] <ale_> coldhead: it does not show any alert..strange
[20:56:46] <diegoviola> how to add a loading indicator to an $.ajax() or $.get() request?
[20:56:57] <diegoviola> like a "loading" image
[20:57:20] <coldhead> jsfiddel
[20:57:59] <mega> any one seen a p2p plugin for jquery possibly using flash/silverligth/java under the covers?
[21:00:06] <ale_> coldhead: can you help me on this one?h ttp://jsfiddle.net/9Le8Q/
[21:00:08] <ale_> http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8Q/
[21:00:09] <coldhead> diegoviola: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/04/display-loading-gif-image-while-loading.html
[21:00:27] <coldhead> that and a thousand other pages google can direct you to >: |
[21:00:35] <diegoviola> coldhead: ty
[21:02:13] <ale_> coldhead: can you please?
[21:02:18] <coldhead> you have a syntax error here, ale_
[21:02:20] <Guest66359> This file http://pastebin.com/zPHJmEkq written using jquery 1.3.2 is not working with jquery 1.4.2 .
[21:02:25] <coldhead> which may be why it isn't alerting
[21:02:29] <coldhead> i am tidying it up for you
[21:02:58] <ale_> coldhead: yes, but it has nothing to do, I just broke it placing a false }
[21:04:18] <coldhead> ale_: http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8Q/1/ that's a working version
[21:04:43] <coldhead> i am using parseJSON but you don't need that if your .ajax() method is parsing the JS for you
[21:06:56] <ale_> coldhead: great..I am trying to make it work on here now
[21:08:11] <coldhead> ale_: http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8Q/2/ that's how i'd do the guts of it
[21:10:37] <ale_> coldhead: that's a nice one! But still..still getting the same [object Object]
[21:10:56] <gf3> Ã¸bjet
[21:12:11] <coldhead> you must have different code locally to what you have on jsfiddle
[21:12:27] <coldhead> which is where console.log is invaluable
[21:12:42] <coldhead> you can inspect the structure and try the properties on the console
[21:12:53] <coldhead> like typing data.results.id should show "1"
[21:13:03] <coldhead> and if it instead shows another object
[21:13:07] <coldhead> there's your issue
[21:14:48] <ale_> coldhead: fantastic...no, I have a rear problem, because it's not updating me when I save a file
[21:14:55] <ale_> So I'll have to restart maybe
[21:15:03] <ale_> coldhead: thanks so much for your help!
[21:15:05] <coldhead> good luck!

[21:46:32] <felo_> I am using getAttribute instead now

[21:56:45] <aroman> Hi, I've written some code that works fine most of the time, but causes my browser to hang (like max CPU) when the function is called in rapid succession. (Like button mashing on a keyboard, as that's how it's triggered). Would anyone mind taking a look? It's really baffling me. http://dpaste.org/CBZg/
[22:03:58] <progrock> Am I right to believe uglifyjs removes with statements and replaces with the ull variable namespace?
