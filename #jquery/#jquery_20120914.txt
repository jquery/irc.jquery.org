[00:04:30] <sent-hil> in jmobile, do i wrap each text element in fieldcontain div or one fieldcontain for all fields?
[00:04:49] <anda> cold give me a moment
[00:07:31] <anda> coldhead, when i click on the submit button the js alert works
[00:07:55] <coldhead> okay
[00:07:58] <anda> and  when i commented  the alert im not getting any output
[00:07:59] <coldhead> so this is progress
[00:08:03] <anda> yes!!
[00:08:05] <anda> :)
[00:08:22] <coldhead> you're going to need to be very brave now, anda
[00:08:30] <coldhead> which browser are you testing in
[00:08:33] <anda> lol yeah
[00:08:38] <anda> firefox
[00:08:42] <coldhead> okay
[00:08:45] <coldhead> do you have firebug?
[00:08:52] <coldhead> if not: get firebug
[00:08:59] <anda> yes
[00:09:10] <coldhead> open firebug and reload the page
[00:09:16] <coldhead> go to the network tab
[00:09:24] <coldhead> and click the button
[00:09:30] <coldhead> you should see the ajax request there
[00:09:49] <anda> ok one moment
[00:11:35] <anda> it says 0 requests
[00:12:07] <anda> nvm
[00:12:16] <anda> when i submited now it says
[00:12:22] <anda> i had to refresh the page
[00:13:16] <anda> what should i do now?
[00:13:42] <coldhead> do you see Status 200 OK?
[00:14:12] <coldhead> AND when you click on the filename there, it should show you what is returned
[00:14:19] <coldhead> do you see any actual data?
[00:14:25] <coldhead> the sort of thing you expected?
[00:14:27] <anda> i see 200ok
[00:14:42] <anda> one moment let me check
[00:18:07] <anda> where should i be looking exactly on the POST ? when i click on the link there
[00:18:14] <coldhead> anda: if you are just trying to load some HTML into a div via ajax you might find it easier to use load()
[00:18:17] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/V8Sky/5/
[00:18:19] <letweet> http://jsfiddle.net/BLRSJ/        <<< okay this is very simple, but it sort of achieves what I'm looking for. Only thing is that the content change is very choppy and the instances of the flipper block don't work independently of each other. Any suggestions?
[00:18:19] <coldhead> that uses load
[00:18:20] <coldhead> and it works
[00:18:26] <coldhead> and we can all get on with our lives
[00:18:38] <anda> ok let me see
[00:18:47] <coldhead> the response tab is the one you're interested in, anda
[00:18:55] <coldhead> because uh... you're interested in the response
[00:18:59] <coldhead> you see how that works?
[00:19:03] <coldhead> it's a logic thing
[00:20:57] <coldhead> surf party usa
[00:21:21] <letweet> coldhead are you aware that your "help" is unabashedly dripping with condescention?
[00:21:49] <coldhead> letweet: how much of the backlog have you read?
[00:21:53] <abc-kid> http://jsfiddle.net/rP8gU/ howto stop js in the middle of run?
[00:21:54] <coldhead> this has been a very long process
[00:22:01] <coldhead> meeker men would have given up
[00:22:14] <coldhead> AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION, it's spelled condescension
[00:22:18] <coldhead> :D
[00:23:01] <abc-kid> any idea? thanks in advance
[00:23:57] <coldhead> abc-kid: return false;
[00:24:54] <letweet> coldhead, not much
[00:25:25] <letweet> was just curious anyway
[00:26:09] <coldhead> very well aware, don't take me too seriously letweet
[00:26:15] <abc-kid> coldhead: looks like return false does not work, still alert the next line
[00:26:33] <abc-kid> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/rP8gU/
[00:27:00] <coldhead> abc-kid: "We can break the $.each() loop at a particular iteration by making the callback function return false."
[00:27:38] <jeffreydev> He isn't talking about that each loop though, he wants to break that one and the parent loop
[00:27:42] <coldhead> oh abc-kid, you want to break out of the whole thing
[00:27:45] <coldhead> sorry sorry sorry
[00:27:51] <coldhead> you will need to use a guard variable
[00:27:54] <coldhead> let me demonstrate

[00:29:16] <coldhead> letweet: http://jsfiddle.net/BLRSJ/1/
[00:29:20] <coldhead> that close enough?
[00:30:27] <anda> coldhead thank you, i will test some things and see if i can make this work, maybe something with the calling the div
[00:30:41] <anda> probably gonna go to sleep
[00:30:44] <anda> soon
[00:31:00] <abc-kid> coldhead: it looks like still continue to exe the js ?
[00:33:42] <abc-kid> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/rP8gU/5/ the demo page seems not working at all

[00:38:34] <coldhead> who's going to the big game tonight?
[00:38:42] <rgr> possible to get chrome to auto expand logged objects?
[00:39:36] <letweet> sorry coldhead, got pulled onto something else quick, will check in a bit
[00:39:53] <coldhead> letweet: no fear, i think it should do what you want and in only 3 lines <3
[00:40:08] <coldhead> rgr: theoretically but you'd have to go into the debugger internals
[00:40:42] <coldhead> rgr: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10464844/is-there-a-way-to-auto-expand-objects-in-chrome-dev-tools
[00:40:52] <rgr> well theoretically it could be completely rewritten so I'll take that as a "no, not yet", cheers :)  Yes, I googles that too.
[00:41:48] <Eviltwin> JSON.stringify
[00:42:04] <Eviltwin> That's probably your best bet short of a rewrite
[00:42:54] <rgr> yeah, I have something like already, just wanted to see if anything had progressed. cheers.
[00:44:01] <abc-kid> thanks. have a great weekends
[00:45:01] <coldhead> what a great result team
[00:45:06] <coldhead> we just kicked a lot of goals
[00:45:09] <coldhead> let's all take 5
[00:45:16] <Eviltwin> "Hey gang"
[00:45:49] <anli__> Is it anything wrong with this url? http://localhost:57775/image?labels[0][text]=testar&labels[0][fontsize]=5&labels[1][text]=test2&labels[1][fontsize]=5
[00:45:52] <letweet> awesome :) thanks coldhead
[00:46:54] <Eviltwin> anli__: That port number's pretty big
[00:47:15] <anli__> Ah, should be http://localhost:57775/image?labels[0].text=testar&labels[0].fontsize=5&labels[1].text=test2&labels[1].fontsize=5
[00:47:21] <Eviltwin> ...
[00:47:23] <letweet> by the way coldhead, no fear... you a 90s / pre-90s kid?
[00:47:46] <coldhead> much older than that
[00:47:46] <anli__> what do I get with []:s instead of ., arrays?
[00:48:00] <coldhead> but i spent exactly 10 years in the 90s
[00:48:05] <coldhead> so that counts
[00:48:12] <Eviltwin> Any port number >=49152 should probably not be used
[00:48:50] <Eviltwin> coldhead: If I told you I didn't spend 10 years in the 90s would you feel old?
[00:49:16] <Eviltwin> anli__: The structure of query params should be designed for the server, not the client
[00:49:37] <Eviltwin> anli__: Unless your server is speaking JavaScript, it's probably not going to understand the hybrid [] and . structure
[00:49:39] <hooloovoo> Eviltwin: sooo young!
[00:49:48] <Eviltwin> If it's PHP, it's going to speak only []'s
[00:49:58] <coldhead> i already feel terribly old, Eviltwin
[00:50:04] <coldhead> but of course, you are no help
[00:50:19] <coldhead> ye loveable young rove, ye
[00:50:59] <anda> coldhead does it make diffrence if im using database in the php code?
[00:51:22] <anda> because this is not just loading the content but actull echo from user
[00:53:40] <coldhead> i am not sure how to respond
[00:54:16] <xec> try jumping jacks
[00:54:42] <anda> im not sure, hmm try the easiest way coldhead
[00:55:11] <anda> ajax has been always the black magic for me
[00:55:55] <anda> its like the alert works but i cant get the content to make it display but i know all the php is good since it runs fine
[00:56:16] <devslash> i need help with my site. it is http://iosdevs.org/devslash/MyMusicStreamer/. if you click on add link of a song, it will add it to a playlist. Im trying to figure out how to change the playlist text. nothing is working for me
[00:59:53] <devslash> anyone ?
[01:00:32] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I have a policy of not dealing in sites, only jsFiddles
[01:00:49] <Eviltwin> There are just too many moving parts on sites
[01:01:03] <devslash> there really aren't any animations at all
[01:01:08] <devslash> if that what you mean
[01:01:12] <Eviltwin> It's not
[01:01:14] <Eviltwin> I mean there's code
[01:01:15] <xec> hehe, i don't think thats what he means, no
[01:01:21] <coldhead> he means in the sense of a woman's love
[01:01:26] <devslash> well its kind of a jquery question
[01:01:45] <Eviltwin> I'm sure it is
[01:01:54] <Eviltwin> I'll defer to coldhead's expertise
[01:01:57] <Eviltwin> It's his first day using jQuery
[01:02:04] <devslash> all that I want to do is change the text but it doesn't seem to be changing
[01:02:36] <xec> devslash: try to make a prototype in jsfiddle
[01:02:53] <anda> i wish js was supporting php...
[01:02:56] <devslash> i can't because its based off of a customized jplayer plugin
[01:03:10] <devslash> anda what do you mean
[01:03:18] <anda> rule number one, never use plugins
[01:03:29] <devslash> you can have php and JS talk to each other
[01:03:35] <devslash> its something I use and need
[01:03:39] <xec> devslash: of course you can. you can add whatever resources you want to jsfiddle. but in your case you're just trying to change some text? make a fiddle where you try to change some text.
[01:03:54] <devslash> its easier to just use firebug on my site
[01:04:01] <anda> devslash but you cant really use echo and php code in jsfiddle
[01:04:02] <Eviltwin> So you say
[01:04:03] <Eviltwin> I say not
[01:05:24] <xec> devslash: you don't have to follow our suggestions of course, but don't expect us to be willing (or even able) to help
[01:05:39] <devslash> all I'm asking is for someone to open up firebug on my sute
[01:05:41] <devslash> site
[01:05:48] <Eviltwin> That's kind of asking a lot
[01:06:26] <xec> devslash: no it's not. you're asking someone to find the bug when we don't even know what your js does. i'm not going to go through a site full to chase it down.
[01:06:30] <xec> ?testcase @ devslash
[01:06:31] <bot-t> devslash, http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[01:06:37] <devslash> there no JS
[01:06:47] <xec> there is no js? no wonder it's not working then :)
[01:06:50] <devslash> i have a playlist that gets populated
[01:07:04] <devslash> i have 1000 lines of JS but for what I need it has nothing to do with JS
[01:07:21] <Eviltwin> So isolate your problem
[01:07:23] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ devslash
[01:07:23] <bot-t> devslash, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[01:07:42] <devslash> the only way for someone to help me fix it is by using firebug
[01:08:00] <devslash> you do not need to dig through any code at all
[01:08:19] <Eviltwin> If that's the only way then you have deeper problems
[01:08:31] <devslash> its the easiest way
[01:08:38] <Eviltwin> For you maybe
[01:08:40] <Eviltwin> Not for us
[01:08:59] <coldhead> i have deep problems
[01:09:01] <coldhead> it's so true
[01:09:05] * coldhead breaks down
[01:09:23] <blackspotwiggins> there there coldhead
[01:12:00] <coldhead> it's just so hard
[01:21:22] <letweet> coldhead, much older than the 90s? Which decade was your favorite? I liked the 90s most... everything seemed more chilled back then
[01:22:39] <coldhead> the 90s to meet were so 80s
[01:22:42] <coldhead> not in a bad way
[01:22:46] <Eviltwin> I think you mean more chill
[01:22:46] <coldhead> but very much so
[01:22:50] <Eviltwin> Not more chilled
[01:22:55] <coldhead> Eviltwin: >: |
[01:22:55] <Eviltwin> It wasn't an ice age
[01:23:08] <coldhead> chillax, militant grammarian
[01:23:25] <coldhead> take a chilled pilled, jilled
[01:23:35] <Eviltwin> Oh, right, people used to say "chillax"
[01:23:52] <Eviltwin> :P
[01:24:25] <coldhead> now they say "surf party USA!!!"
[01:24:31] <coldhead> people are totes cray
[01:25:24] <shoky> devslash: function createPlaylistTag(trackPath)
[01:25:42] <devslash> what about it
[01:25:44] <shoky> that function creates the name that appears in the playlist..
[01:25:55] <devslash> yes I know
[01:26:02] <shoky> what's the prob then
[01:26:07] <devslash> but it adds it to the myPlaylist object
[01:26:16] <devslash> I want to change the display track name later
[01:26:35] <devslash> i cannot call that function
[01:27:11] <coldhead> good luck, beautiful people
[01:27:17] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your lives
[01:30:54] <shoky> devslash: $('#jp_playlist_1 li').eq(0).find('.jp-playlist-item').text('hahaha')
[01:31:16] <devslash> wow perfect thank you
[01:31:28] <devslash> thats exactly what I was trying to do
[01:31:54] <shoky> pretty simple query ;p
[01:32:23] <Stonekeeper> Hi! It's my understanding that I can't get the localhost's network domain via jquery/javascript. Is that right?
[01:32:30] <Already> Is there a reason why .remove doesn't work with .delay?
[01:32:51] <shoky> Already: .delay is only for queued stuff like animations
[01:33:17] <Already> Ah so .remove just isn't queued? Well simple and good explanation i guess. :)
[01:33:39] <Eviltwin> Already: ?see delay
[01:33:48] <Eviltwin> Already: see ?delay
[01:33:48] <bot-t> Already, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[01:33:51] <Eviltwin> Damn, I keep doing that
[01:34:11] <Eviltwin> Already: They explain a bit more about it there
[01:34:42] <Already> I'll have a look, thanks. I guess I'll just have to go another way about it.
[01:34:55] <Eviltwin> They explain how on that page :D
[01:37:40] <blackspotwiggins> you can use .queue() to add anything
[01:40:46] <anli__> $.param generates labels[0].label=&labels[0].size=5&labels[1].label=&labels[1].size=5&labels[2].label=&labels[2].size=5 instead of labels[0].label=&labels[0].size=5&labels[1].label=&labels[1].size=5&labels[2].label=&labels[2].size=5 , why?
[01:41:00] <anli__> oops
[01:41:04] <anli__> Sorry
[01:41:09] <anli__> It generates labels[0][label]=&labels[0][size]=5&labels[1][label]=&labels[1][size]=5&labels[2][label]=&labels[2][size]=5
[01:41:21] <anli__> But size and label will be treated as arrays on server side
[01:41:32] <anli__> And they are just string and int originally
[01:41:34] <rgr> gah. having an awful time tryng to use draggable but convert the element to position:absolute after the drag when it was a relatively positioned element before the drag.
[01:44:16] <blackspotwiggins> anli__, that's the correct serialization
[01:44:25] <blackspotwiggins> http does not support typing if you did not know that
[01:44:29] <blackspotwiggins> handle that on the server side
[01:46:02] <anli__> I know what http is, seems that $.param cant be used because if you have an array with objects, all their members will be serialized as arrays
[01:46:43] <anli__> ?foo=bar[0][x]=1 instead of ?foo=bar[0].x=!
[01:46:48] <bot-t> anli__, #4346 (Data missing after adding to two elements.) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4346
[01:46:53] <anli__> oops, should be 1 instead of !
[01:47:22] <blackspotwiggins> what
[01:47:41] <blackspotwiggins> that's how it's supposed to work
[01:47:44] <blackspotwiggins> lrn2params
[01:47:50] <anli__> bar[0][x] is treated as a two dimensional array in a lot of languages
[01:47:59] <blackspotwiggins> it's not a language syntax
[01:48:00] <blackspotwiggins> it's httpo
[01:48:03] <anli__> Where 0 is the index of the outer array and "x" the index of the inner
[01:48:04] <blackspotwiggins> -o
[01:48:07] <NodeX> anyone use jquery mobile?
[01:48:15] <anli__> Instead of having x being a property
[01:48:25] <blackspotwiggins> that's the tragedy of whatever sad language you are using to parse http
[01:48:41] <anli__> You cannot parse http to start with
[01:48:44] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, i can say that yes, someone has used it
[01:48:52] <blackspotwiggins> anli__, o really?
[01:48:59] <blackspotwiggins> how do you think it works then?
[01:49:15] <anli__> the query string is just garbabe from https viewpoint
[01:49:23] <anli__> So http is out of the discussion
[01:49:30] <blackspotwiggins> you fool.
[01:49:34] <anli__> Thanks
[01:50:46] <NodeX> blackspotwiggins : helpful as usual :P
[01:51:21] <NodeX> Does anyone know how to make it initialise on my page, I thought it auto loaded and made all the changes but it seems not
[01:52:18] <anli__> :)
[01:52:44] <anli__> "you fool" is always a way of conveying information
[01:54:36] <asido> are there any plugins available like a magazine here in brown background: http://issuu.com/ ?
[01:54:55] <NodeX> nvm, bad coding by the dev forgot a ";" which was killing it
[01:56:05] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, you've been here long enough to know that asking if anyone has ever done anything is kinda pointless
[01:56:29] <blackspotwiggins> even more if the question is like "has anyone used jquery" or similar
[01:58:23] <NodeX> well seeing as it's not a specific jqm room I think it's not pointless
[02:00:48] <rgr> so how would you convert an element from relative positioning to absolute "in place" with no visible hopping? Any trick?
[02:01:24] <blackspotwiggins> rgr, you can use offsetParent() to determine current offset
[02:01:31] <Eviltwin> var x = elem.offset(), elem.css({position: "absolute", left: x.left, top: x.top}); ?
[02:01:39] <rgr> offsetParent is not correct
[02:02:14] <rgr> Eviltwin: yeah offset() seems the way and yes, that object with one call is neat. thanks.
[02:02:30] <blackspotwiggins> well, depends on if the element is inside another positioned one
[02:02:44] <blackspotwiggins> offset is page relative, offsetParent is relative to closest positioned element
[02:02:57] <rgr> yes.
[02:03:21] <blackspotwiggins> if you change your markup, the with offset it will break
[02:03:24] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/position
[02:03:25] <blackspotwiggins> then*
[02:03:58] <rgr> I should have said page absolute. offsert() is the way.
[02:04:41] <Eviltwin> rgr: position: absolute is actually relative to the top left corner of the closest ancestor that is absolute or relative positioned
[02:04:56] <Eviltwin> Actually I think it's non-staticly positioned
[02:05:01] <rgr> closetst element thats not static.
[02:05:16] <Eviltwin> Beat you to it
[02:05:32] <rgr> yes I know - in this cse none are so its the html element. hence page absolute. cheers guys.
[02:12:21] <rgr> its hopping down when I do the rel to abs conversion and worse things on the drag (the jquery ui draggable properties sure could be documented beter - theres a raft of position type records in the draggable data object with no apparent documention or guidelines) . Something is amiss. Could be twiddle time.
[02:16:02] <anli__> Has $(':text') been removed?
[02:17:30] <anli__> alert($(':text').length); outputs 0, even if I have textboxes on my webpage
[02:17:47] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/text-selector/
[02:18:12] <anli__> Funny, I had that webpage open already
[02:18:56] <Kingsy> can you toggle() any html attribute? say I wanted to toggle onclick="" ?
[02:19:17] <anli__> Define toggle
[02:19:55] <Kingsy> well by default its set to "whatever.save()" so I want to toggle between that and ""
[02:20:14] <Kingsy> exactly the same functionality as toggleClass
[02:20:22] <Kingsy> but with onclick
[02:20:41] <Kingsy> I assume that is the easiest way of stopping a button being clickable?
[02:21:09] <Eviltwin> http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#Inline_Event_Handlers
[02:21:25] <NodeX> Kingsy : use prop('disabled',true);
[02:22:50] <Kingsy> NodeX: that will disable the button?
[02:23:33] <Kingsy> NodeX: that did nothing
[02:24:03] <Kingsy> NodeX: this is what I have atm --> http://jsfiddle.net/9wqZk/ <-- it just disables it on check, it doesnt toggle
[02:24:13] <Kingsy> by disables I mean removes the onclick method
[02:30:10] <sh0ne> how can I call handler function (which don't belongs to the element on which addEventListener is called, but it is the outside) from addEventListener? For example I have "  $(this.el).find('[data-dialog-input="file"]')[0].addEventListener("drop", this.catchFile, false);  " and I want to call handler catchFile that is outside of element (don't belong to that element, so I cannot use this.catchFile) ? I tried this.parent().catchFile but t
[02:30:10] <sh0ne> hat doesn't work either.
[02:30:20] <adac> guys I have the following situation: http://jsfiddle.net/x4dXm/2/ Now when I click on one of the links, query should read out the "mystring" value of the corresponding link.  How to do that?
[02:32:10] <Pitel_IPEX> how can I fire event when some select item is selected? ponchagne does not work, when I select same item again.
[02:33:00] <Already> adac what query? You'd have to do something like $("a").click(function(){$(this).text();return false;}
[02:33:21] <anli__> Do I need to create a timer to fire events on the user changing contents in a textbox?
[02:34:21] <anli__> In a .keydown handler, .val of a textbox gives me the old value
[02:34:56] <adac> Already, I'm not sure how i can bind a click event on such a dynamic list of links. They all have the same class, mayb it is possible via this class name and then get th id and bid the events on the ids?
[02:35:11] <adac> *bind not bid
[02:38:58] <Already> I'm not sure I understand what you're planning to do, btw. the top right field is CSS not HTMl. ;) http://jsfiddle.net/x4dXm/3/ does that help?
[02:39:51] <Already> anli__ did you try keyup?
[02:40:09] <Already> or .change?
[02:40:15] <anli__> That works, but does not give me the same functionality
[02:40:25] <anli__> I want to react directly
[02:42:05] <beepbeep_> Hey all, my request.success() has access to html, how do I replace my $(form).html with the $(form).html inside that html?
[02:42:42] <beepbeep_> already found.
[02:43:03] <danielhunt> *wave* Hey there - I'm trying to find out how I can monitor a page for the insertion of new dom nodes that match a given selector. live() has been deprecated, and the recommendation is to use .on(), but I cannot for the life of me find an event name that will allow me to watch for new element creation. does anyone have a helpful pointer they could share relating to this?
[02:43:27] <anli__> Ok, seems that I must use $('input[type=text]'), $(':text') is not working
[02:43:41] <xec> danielhunt: .live() never detected insertion of new dom nodes
[02:43:54] <xec> danielhunt: what exactly are you trying to do?
[02:43:59] <danielhunt> xec: oh, i see
[02:44:37] <danielhunt> xec: when new elements are added to a page, that match a given selector, i want to auto-fetch data from a server, related to that node, and populate the node with the content
[02:44:57] <xec> danielhunt: how do these elements get added to the page?
[02:45:20] <danielhunt> xec: the point being, to allow me to dump <span data-foo-id="123"></span> into the dom, and have some js magic automatigically see that node, and pull&populate
[02:45:47] <danielhunt> xec: through any number of ways. right now, with ajax calls. in the future? *shrug* anything JS related i suppose
[02:47:10] <danielhunt> xec: i've been experimenting with $(document).ajaxComplete(), which obviously will help with the ajax calls. but not for code-related additions
[02:48:16] <Already> Should $("<div />").delay(4000); stop script exectuion for a time?
[02:48:29] <danielhunt> xec: not to mention the fact that ajaxComplete() doesn't *appear* to be working all the time for me (debugging as we speak)
[02:48:50] <xec> danielhunt: well, the usual way to go about it is to have the code that gets the new content create the element, not the other way around
[02:48:50] <rgr> it seems if a parent has a margin-top offset fails when inside draggables strart dragging call back. remove the margin and all good. ack.
[02:49:34] <danielhunt> xec: yeah, that's what i was trying to avoid, actually. i want to be able to dump the node-string anywhere on the page and the magic central code will just see it, and auto-fill it
[02:49:55] <jomofcw> Hello !
[02:50:32] <xec> danielhunt: yeah. i suggest you rethink the structure. make your own lib/methods that helps you do what you want
[02:50:35] <xec> danielhunt: there are DOM mutation events that could be useful if you insist on doing it the wrong way ;) but i don't think it's cross browser
[02:50:42] <Already> hi jomofcw
[02:50:43] <jomofcw> How can I get the element origin of an event please ? I.E. I click on a LI element that trigger the "click" event of the parent UL, in the function, I want to get the LI I click, how to ?
[02:50:52] <jomofcw> hi Already :).
[02:51:41] <danielhunt> xec: i understand that suggestion to rethink the structure, believe me. but i don't believe that this should be all that difficult to do :) i *would*, however, like to steer clear of any dom mutation event listening :)
[02:52:03] <danielhunt> xec: i'm actually a little surprised that jQuery doesn't have an event for this kind of thing
[02:52:13] <danielhunt> or rather, if it does, that i haven't found it
[02:53:00] <danielhunt> xec: right, well, thanks for your help anyway. :)
[02:53:16] <danielhunt> $(document).ajaxComplete(function() { console.log('ajaxComplete'); }); <-- any idea why this wouldn't be firing for every ajax request that completes?
[02:53:33] <danielhunt> it fires for the first events, but none after that
[02:53:39] <danielhunt> first event*
[02:54:03] <JelmerD> Guys i'm running into some trouble here. I am making use of the .dialog extensions, but with a small fade animation when opening and closing. The dialog is opened/closed on a click event. Now, when I click the button for 10 times, it will open, close, open, close, open close
[02:54:11] <JelmerD> How can I stop the animation on a new "click" ?
[02:54:15] <danielhunt> actually - it's being called for *2* ajax requests. but no subsequent ones
[02:54:26] <JelmerD> Normally you can do something like .stop(), but, not here?
[02:54:59] <helllen> helllo
[02:55:29] <helllen> I would like to redirect to a page with some params (like $.ajax) but completly recirected
[02:55:44] <helllen> I used to use window.location = url
[02:56:05] <helllen> the problem is I need to specify data attributes (array, and some other elements)
[02:56:26] <danielhunt> helllen: there's a helper function for generating url-friendly params from an array
[02:56:33] <danielhunt> helllen: $.params(), i think?
[02:56:34] * danielhunt checks
[02:56:39] <helllen> ahms
[02:56:57] <danielhunt> helllen: $.param()
[02:56:59] <danielhunt> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[02:57:00] <jomofcw> And so the answer is : event.delegateTarget
[02:57:55] <helllen> thanks
[02:58:27] <danielhunt> helllen: no worries
[03:05:26] <ozette> jQuery tools'   "$('#div').tooltip( effect: 'slide')"  doesn't work in IE9 ?
[03:05:48] <ozette> my tooltip won't show up, but it does in other browsers
[03:06:30] <ozette> jQuery tools claims to work in  IE6+
[03:06:32] <danielhunt> anyone have any ideas on my ajaxComplete() issue?
[03:12:00] <ozette> http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/any-html.html  does not work in IE, can anyone confirm?
[03:18:17] <Already> .done() on my own functions. Darn.
[03:25:51] <pangelovski> hi guys, when doing an alert, is it possible to remove the page name?
[03:26:00] <ozette> http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/any-html.html  does not work in IE, can anyone confirm by hovering over the "Download now" button, a tooltip should appear
[03:28:41] <rohith> hi all
[03:28:48] <rohith> is anyone there......?
[03:28:55] <rohith> to chat with me..............?
[03:29:09] <xdjuj__> Hi :)
[03:29:19] <xdjuj__> What is actually the best jQuery Tooltip plugin ?
[03:29:32] <xdjuj__> I use to have my own tooltip, but maybe there a cool plugin :)
[03:29:40] <Cork> xdjuj: depends in what term you mean best
[03:29:45] <ozette> well I like the jQuery Tools one, but it doesn't seem to work in IE
[03:30:18] <Cork> a fav of mine is beutytip, its quite badly coded though
[03:32:43] <Already> *breaks out in tears*
[03:33:15] * AdamPDotty slaps Already around a bit with a large trout
[03:33:23] <ozette> *pats*
[03:35:01] <Already> THanks both of you. It would've been to nice if my code just worked on IE.
[03:36:05] * AdamPDotty has heard such before
[03:36:07] <ozette> I know how you feel my friend
[03:38:20] <Already> What a difference an equal sign makes, 24 little bits ... or so. It's been a fast fix... though I doubt that it's just going to work out like that.
[03:41:19] <Sicp> I want to change the background image of an element if it is selected, but doing the following is not working, it just doesn't do it. http://jsfiddle.net/X2qVf/
[03:42:25] <AdamPDotty> CSS != innerHTML
[03:42:42] <AdamPDotty> does it work this way?
[03:42:48] * AdamPDotty fells it should not
[03:43:55] <Sicp> it doesn't of course
[03:44:01] <Sicp> that's why I'm complaining :P
[03:44:03] <ozette> try $(element).css(..)
[03:44:15] <Sicp> ok
[03:44:21] <Sicp> but the hard CSS inside is correct?
[03:44:24] <Sicp> background-image etc...
[03:44:25] <Sicp> ?
[03:45:19] <Sicp> ok it applied something wrong
[03:45:22] <Sicp> but it did apply it
[03:45:28] <AdamPDotty> try single quotes outside
[03:45:40] <AdamPDotty> then you do not need to escape the doubles inside
[03:45:53] <AdamPDotty> but it looks ok to me
[03:46:30] <ozette> you can just do "background: url(...) no-repeat;
[03:50:58] <Sicp> hmmm, it is just minimizing the text..
[03:51:04] <Sicp> but it IS applying it to the correct element :P
[03:51:47] <Sicp> this was the final line, $(divsMostViewed).css('background-image: url(../Images/listBox/selector.png)');
[03:53:11] <ozette> Sicp, minimizing the text?
[03:53:41] <ozette> what do you mean by that
[03:54:32] <AdamPDotty> ah
[03:54:41] <AdamPDotty> css(9 is used slightly differently
[03:55:12] <AdamPDotty> css('color', 'Blue');
[03:55:38] <AdamPDotty> not ('color: Blue')
[03:55:57] <AdamPDotty> theres a variation with more bracktes, too, but I dont like it
[03:56:08] * AdamPDotty goes and trains spelling
[03:58:34] * Already cheers for AdamPDotty
[04:01:28] <MasterX1> Hello everyone .
[04:04:37] <Already> Is there any reason that i can't get a click event on a floating img?
[04:04:39] <Already> hi MasterX1
[04:05:23] <MasterX1> Sorry if this is nobish but does anyone know how can I obtain the "nth-child" number of "this" ? I'm using several sections all referring to the same function on click . I'd like my function to run a switch case based on the nth-child number . Something like // function foo () {var child = $(this).[some code IDK]  switch(child) {case "1" , case "2" , ... etc }; };
[04:06:28] <juha_> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[04:08:13] <Already> Is there anything special I have to do after adding elements using .after so that they get registerd by .click and so on?
[04:10:14] <MasterX1> @juha_ Thanks , so just use // var child = $(this:nth-child) ? That only leave my var null . I've looked a bit into the problem but i can't figure out the syntax .
[04:10:30] <juha_> ?on @ Already
[04:10:30] <bot-t> Already, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:10:59] <juha_> MasterX1: nope, that's invalid
[04:11:40] <Already> Thanks juha_
[04:13:51] <Zepo> Hey Guys, I downloaded this http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox Stuff here, but the Default design really bugs me so  I want to change it to a really "HTML" Default or atleast make the triangle Black without downloading another UI
[04:13:53] <MasterX1> @juha_ I've seen that it's invalid but I can't figure out how to do it .
[04:14:16] <Already> MasterX1 it's working in a different way. It would be :nth-child(number) so you wouldn't really be able to build a switch I'd guess.
[04:14:27] <Already> at least as fare as i understand it.
[04:14:53] <MasterX1> Yes , the problem is I'm trying to get that number.
[04:16:19] <Zepo> Okay, doing Question easier. How do I stop this autocomplete from using UI - Framework ?
[04:16:20] <Already> If you want to make it standard why not use the default HTMl <select> Zepo?
[04:16:42] <Zepo> Already: I want the Autcomplete Function
[04:16:47] <fusion27> I'm trying to get this one to return this string, but my skull thickness appears to be getting in the wayâ€¦ I'm returning '', anyone got a minute to help a brother pry his head from his arse? http://pastie.org/4714225.  I've confirmed that irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#14Â is returning a value
[04:17:07] <fusion27> sorry #14
[04:17:15] <fusion27> not sure where that irc link came from
[04:17:48] <juha_> MasterX1: oh you want to get the child number for your element?
[04:18:08] <juha_> MasterX1: if you're doing it inside .each() loop, that will give you that number
[04:18:29] <Ravindran> fusion27: your console.log should be inside the success handler
[04:18:30] <MasterX1> Got it , the syntax was //$(this).index()
[04:18:36] <AdamPDotty> http://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:18:51] <MasterX1> Thanks for the help guys .
[04:18:54] <AdamPDotty> I am getting slow
[04:18:58] <myme> http://jsfiddle.net/qUeWU/1/ -- Different behavoir on hide depending on if the element's in the document or not.
[04:19:12] <Already> Zepo did you have a look at the default functionaly? It looks like the thing you want.
[04:19:25] <myme> I thought it was a synchronisity issue related to setting $.fx.off messing up my tests, but it's not touching the display property at all...
[04:22:44] <myme> I have no idea if that's been discussed and deliberatly decided before, but I'd consider that broken.
[04:23:52] <fusion27> Ravindran: http://pastie.org/4719217
[04:23:53] <Already> If i bind a click event to * i should be able to determin every object that was clicked, right?
[04:24:00] <fusion27> This has to be something simple
[04:24:37] <fusion27> I'm trying to separate my "model" functions from "controller" functions
[04:24:42] <fusion27> in to their own files
[04:25:25] <fusion27> on model.js #15 I am getting the return  I seek
[04:26:00] <fusion27> but on index.js #34 it's getting '' on the reutnr
[04:26:03] <fusion27> return
[04:26:09] <Already> I guess that's it for today. I can't figure out the error. Have a nice day everyone! :)
[04:26:26] <Already> Oh and thanks for all the help
[04:43:14] <Ravindran> fusion27: The userID is received from server asynchronously. But the function return the value prematurely (which is empty string). That's why you are not getting the value in index.js
[04:43:49] <fusion27> Ravindran: I'm still kinda new to JS and programming in general
[04:43:58] <fusion27> How would I fix this?
[04:44:05] <Sicp> it's .css("background-image", "url(../path/to/url)");
[04:44:12] <Sicp> so one more thing, what if I want to have some variable in 1 file..manipulating it and whatever, then I want to access it in another file and keep manipulating it and whatnot
[04:45:34] <Ravindran> fusion27: you can return the '$.ajax' object from the model_get_user_auth function and attach success/failure callback in index.js
[04:46:30] <fusion27> Thanks Ravindran, I'll look in to it
[04:53:57] <Bacta> Hi - if I placed a piece of async code inside an onunload event and then accessed the dom on the error handler (the tab should have closed by that point) what would I be referencing?
[04:54:45] <pangelovski> hi guys
[05:00:13] <mazzachre> I love this code I have been given to maintain and sort out... Especially the layout part... <table><tr><td><span style="float: left;"><a href="..." style="margin: 5px;"><img width="20px"../></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href"..." style="margin: 5px;"><img...</a></span>...
[05:00:24] <mazzachre> How can you anything but love that?! :D
[05:00:49] <mazzachre> All the code is done like that!
[05:01:26] <mazzachre> Then the javascript is even better... loads of global vars and global functions...
[05:03:29] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, dont forget inline js
[05:03:41] <AdamPDotty> thats the globalisation I have heard of
[05:04:29] <mazzachre> Oh it is all inline... the code is dottet with <script type="text/javascript">...</script> There is only jQuery library, jQueryUI being loaded...
[05:05:45] <mazzachre> I am seriously wondering what to do with it...
[05:08:38] <adac> how can i copy a div content into a textbox?
[05:09:16] <mazzachre> $('textbox').val($('#mydiv').text());
[05:09:42] <mazzachre> or .html() depending on what you want... html() will be structured
[05:23:19] <klawd_pr1me> hi!
[05:23:34] <klawd_pr1me> is there a way to access an element as soon as it gets inserted into the dom tree?
[05:23:40] <klawd_pr1me> like a listener on a selector?
[05:23:43] <klawd_pr1me> like .live?
[05:26:50] <fusion27> klawd_pr1me: I typically use .bind()
[05:27:23] <fusion27> make a gist or pastie.org of your code inserting your element in to the dom
[05:28:21] <oberst> I have a tabbed controls initialised by $(".tabs > ul").tabs("section > section"); . Looks like this kind of initialization isn't described on http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ page and i cannot set active tab with $(".tabs > ul").tabs("section > section", {selected: 1});. How can I do this?
[05:31:34] <klawd_pr1me> nvm, i just found .bind("DOMSubtreeModified")
[05:31:46] <iface_> @klawd_prime you should look at delegate http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:33:49] <seutje> klawd_pr1me: note that not all browsers implement DOM mutation events
[05:35:13] <blackspotwiggins> notably IE
[05:36:04] <adac> mazzachre, thank you! I have bound an event on paste on the textbox. but with this copy this event does not fire... any ideas?
[05:49:52] <danielhunt> it looks like the ajaxComplete() function isn't firing when i'm doing a cross-origin request :/
[05:49:58] <danielhunt> has anyone seen this before?
[05:52:45] <danielhunt> ... same for ajaxStart()
[05:52:47] <danielhunt> wtf...
[05:52:58] <danielhunt> works for *some*, but not all CORS requests
[05:53:26] <danielhunt> specifically, it fails 99% of the time, with JSONP requests
[06:01:35] <blackspotwiggins> danielhunt, jsonp does not really use ajax
[06:01:44] <blackspotwiggins> it adds a <script> tag
[06:02:23] <adac> $('textbox').val($('#mydiv').text()); having this works fine it does copy and past the content. however I have a trigger on paste for this textbox which doesnt fire qith this line of code. any ideas hwo to make the event fire?
[06:02:55] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: sure, but it's called through the .ajax() function, so i'd expect it to fire events as though it is
[06:03:21] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, it doesnt
[06:04:08] <danielhunt> well, it *does* :) that's the problem
[06:04:17] <danielhunt> it's firing it for some requests, but not others
[06:04:46] <blackspotwiggins> well, it doesnt reliably anyway
[06:04:50] * danielhunt nods
[06:04:51] <danielhunt> arse
[06:04:52] <danielhunt> :(
[06:06:07] <blackspotwiggins> "When the transport mechanism is something other than XMLHttpRequest (for example, a script tag for a JSONP request) the jqXHR object simulates native XHR functionality where possible. "
[06:07:27] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: yeah i read that. hence why i expected the events to fire. looks like they don't fire *at all*, though (the previous firing was accidental, by myself)
[06:11:36] <Zepo> Can someony say me why the last #ldv is a illegal character ->   ($(this).val() == "DV        ") ? $("#ldv ,#ldvs).show() : $("#ldv ,#ldvs").hide();
[06:12:56] <blackspotwiggins> danielhunt, i guess so
[06:13:08] <blackspotwiggins> the complete on the ajax itself might fire
[06:13:16] <blackspotwiggins> but i guess it wont do the global ones
[06:15:34] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: that's what it looks like - regardless of the global option for the ajax request
[06:19:04] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: interesting problem, such a pain
[06:19:08] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: workaround is to: complete: function(e, XHR, options) { jQuery.event.trigger( "ajaxComplete", [ XHR, options ] ); }
[06:19:19] <danielhunt> ... add that to the ajax definition
[06:19:28] <danielhunt> i don't like this solution :/
[06:21:46] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[06:21:52] <danielhunt> blackspotwiggins: 'Note: Global events are never fired for cross-domain script or JSONP requests, regardless of the value of global.'
[06:21:55] <danielhunt> ugh
[06:22:32] <danielhunt> such a pain
[06:22:35] <danielhunt> thanks for the help blackspotwiggins
[06:23:12] <blackspotwiggins> np
[06:24:37] <flump> Can anyone suggest a method for cross-domain JSONP requests which include a cookie, that works in IE? Using a P3P header is the only method I've found to work.
[06:28:45] <norm> is there a way to change what "this" represents within a $.ajax callback?
[06:31:55] <strykr> hello all, just a quick question as I am new to jQuery. :/  I've noticed that in IE9 $(window).height() returns 0, but firefox returns the correct height.  Is there way around it for IE9?
[06:32:26] <pachet> norm: sure, use call, bind or apply
[06:32:31] <pachet> norm: or see .proxy()
[06:32:36] <pachet> ?.proxy() @ norm
[06:32:57] <pachet> bleh - bot-t is probably still on his morning commute
[06:33:25] <hooloovoo> strykr: works for me
[06:33:55] <norm> pachet: perfect, thanks
[06:38:18] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, can anyone make an educated guess which property to change on the slider (the big 1 image when you load the page) to speed it up http://www.doubleclick-print.com/
[06:38:24] <fRAiLtY-> It takes around 10secs or more to slide
[06:40:34] <norm> pachet: even sexier, $.ajax accepts a "context" parameter
[06:40:58] <pachet> norm: oh good catch, i completely forgot about that
[06:41:12] <strykr> hooloovoo: i am just using, $('#id_box').text($(window).height()); to populate a div with the viewport height, theoretically that should work?
[06:43:49] <norm> pachet: no worries, thanks
[06:43:56] <pachet> fRAiLtY-: its not sliding at all for me - you have an error in your glider.js binding
[06:44:16] <aJacom[ghost]> Hi.. I have a little script that works flawlessly in chrome, firefox, safari, opera., it listens to a $().click event, and hides/shows some divs (very simple), but in IE9, I'm getting 'return' statement outside of function. This is the script: http://pastebin.com/HreApzeE and this is the page: nesap.net
[06:44:51] <aJacom[ghost]> note that i have javascript:return false; in the href="" of the elements
[06:44:56] <hooloovoo> strykr: try $(""#id_box").txt("" + $(window).height())
[06:45:01] <hooloovoo> .text*
[06:46:15] <aJacom[ghost]> or should I use ev.preventDefault();, instead of return false; in href="" ?
[06:46:17] <pachet> aJacom[ghost]: that's definitely your problem
[06:46:23] <pachet> i'd recommend - yes
[06:46:24] <pachet> doing that
[06:46:40] <pachet> otherwise, if that's not an option, you need to wrap your return statement ( the inline one ) in an anonymous function
[06:46:41] <fRAiLtY-> pachet:  What is the problem, is el. undefined?
[06:46:59] <strykr> hooloovoo: unfortunately no go, 0 for IE, correct size for firefox.  very weird :s
[06:47:15] <hooloovoo> strykr: you're running it in document ready?
[06:47:43] <AdamPDotty> if you do not want to link, you should not have a href
[06:48:02] <pangelovski> hi, is it possible to check if a transition is complete?
[06:48:18] <pachet> pangelovski: qualify 'transition'
[06:48:21] <anli__> I have a div with three classes, two that I know about and the 3rd varies, what is the most beautiful way getting the 3rd?
[06:48:33] <pachet> strykr: try $(window).innerHeight()
[06:48:36] <strykr> hooloovoo: yes
[06:48:39] <hooloovoo> strykr: also, try window.innerHeight
[06:48:47] <pangelovski> patchet: i have my default transition set to slide. is there somehow to check when a transition has completed
[06:49:04] <pangelovski> i have a bug where my page is shown for a split second before a transition
[06:49:09] <pachet> pangelovski: transition of what? jquery mobile pages?
[06:49:15] <pangelovski> patchet: yes
[06:49:58] <strykr> no go on .innerHeight(), if its working with you guys, must be problem local with me
[06:50:11] <strykr> might go try another IE install
[06:50:27] <seutje> try all the IEs!
[06:51:13] <anli__> Is there a jquery function that removes a string from a space separated string (classname)?
[06:51:23] <anli__> resulting in another space separated string
[06:52:26] <AdamPDotty> maybe without jquery with text.lastIndexOf(' ')
[06:52:37] <pachet> ?eval var div = $('<div class="foo bar baz"/>'), my_classes = ['foo', 'bar'], other_classes = div.attr('class').split(' ').filter(function(a){return my_classes.indexOf(a) !== -1;}); other_classes
[06:52:49] <pachet> bleh, bot-t :[
[06:53:36] <pachet> anli__: anyway, give that a shot
[06:53:56] <pachet> there's probably a more jquery-y answer using $.map or some such, but that shows the logic at least
[06:55:33] <pachet> i guess since this is #jquery, abstracting away the problem of array.indexOf failing on ie<9 with $.inArray wouldn't be a bad idea either
[06:55:34] <bleen> I'm having a weird issue where the following has no effect in webkit browsers until I "inspect element":  $('#foo').css('position', 'relative').animate({paddingRight: '45%'}, 250); â€¦ I'm sure I am doing something wrong somewhere, but does anyone have any ideas what might cause this?
[06:56:55] <anli__> If I create a function with $.fn.remove_from_string = function() { /* etc */}, and I do var str = "test"; str.remove_from_string();, how do I get the string in that function?
[06:57:10] <anli__> must try this
[06:57:12] <ravenzz> bleen try to animate the position
[06:57:22] <ravenzz> left: '45%'
[06:57:27] <anli__> Object object...
[06:57:40] <pachet> anli__: well, normally you'd reference it with '
[06:57:43] <pachet> *'this'
[06:57:52] <bleen> ravenzz: even without the animate â€¦ just the css â€¦ I have the same problem
[06:57:55] <pachet> or 'this'.toString() if you're doing wonky things with objects-as-strings
[06:58:17] <pachet> anli__: but note that in order for you to use that on an object it has to be created via a call to $
[06:58:25] <anli__> var string = $(this).toString(); does not work
[06:58:36] <anli__> So I cannot extend strings
[06:58:36] <anli__> ?
[06:58:45] <ravenzz> bleen prepare a testacase on jsfiddle.net then
[06:59:31] <pachet> anli__: er... jquery is going to try and do all sorts of selector mashing on whatever 'this' equates to
[06:59:36] <bleen> ravenzz: I did and everything works fine there â€¦ so clearly I have something that Im missing but I cant think of where to look
[06:59:39] <pachet> and the result of that call to $ is not going to be a string
[06:59:53] <pachet> hence the result of calling toString on THAT.... will not look like what you want
[07:00:12] <seutje> anli__: sounds like you're trying to make a jquery plugin when what you really want is a regular old function
[07:00:16] <anli__> var foo = "sdfdf"; $(foo).remove_from_string should work, should it not?
[07:00:27] <pachet> no
[07:00:28] <seutje> anli__: no
[07:00:37] <seutje> $.fn.stuff works on jQuery collections
[07:00:37] <anli__> seutje: But I really want to chain stuff
[07:00:49] <anli__> Adding calls by adding code to the right
[07:01:01] <pachet> anli__: you can chain things natively...
[07:01:15] <anli__> I can always create a wrapper, yeah
[07:01:20] <seutje> guess u could fuck with the string prototype
[07:01:25] <anli__> hm
[07:01:29] <anli__> well, why not
[07:01:32] <anli__> :)
[07:01:34] <pachet> i'd recommend not :[
[07:01:42] <seutje> yeah, about that
[07:01:47] <pachet> chaining isn't "cool" enough to warrant that
[07:01:59] <anli__> Its not for the coolness
[07:02:02] <anli__> But clearness
[07:02:16] <Gho5t> only a little bit for impressing the ladies
[07:02:22] <pachet> 'clarity' is the noun you're fishing for
[07:02:59] <Gho5t> you mean the synonym
[07:03:10] <pachet> as for 'remove_from_string', why doesnt my_string.replace('foo', 'bar') work :[
[07:03:36] <anli__> Because I want to create a method that removes a class from a class string
[07:03:52] <anli__> I can always do it by replace... hm
[07:04:01] <anli__> Not so pretty, but
[07:04:47] <seutje> anli__: u mean like classList?
[07:04:52] <anli__> var result = $(div.attr('classname').remove_class('pressed').remove_class('button');
[07:04:53] <anli__> yeah
[07:05:02] <anli__> oops, forgot a )
[07:05:30] <Deviad> Hello everyone.
[07:05:57] <STHayden> hey. I was just wondering if anyone knew what the source of the reports that 1.8.1 was slow in IE? I've seen a lot of blog comments but no one seems to know why it's happening.
[07:06:00] <pachet> you don't have to use 'classname', you can just use 'class' -> it's on that big laundry list of potentially implementation-breaking prop accessors that jquery will watch for you
[07:06:20] <seutje> smells like div.classList.remove('pressed')
[07:06:51] <pachet> STHayden: quantify slow? and which version of IE? i use it daily in ie7 - 9 and havent noticed anything
[07:06:59] <Deviad> Hello Everyone
[07:07:05] <pachet> hello
[07:07:12] <Deviad> I'm using the hashchange plugin and I wrote this script:
[07:07:13] <Deviad> http://pastebin.com/AHX0miEJ
[07:07:35] <pachet> pangelovski: late response, but are you already binding to the 'pageshow' event?
[07:07:41] <pachet> should only fire once the transition is complete
[07:07:45] <Deviad> How do I avoid the normal behavior so that it slides down to the position of the div with id="idname"?
[07:07:58] <seutje> anli__: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.classList might be of interest
[07:08:00] <Deviad> www.stefanopalladino.it that's the site I'm using it against.
[07:08:11] <pachet> against?
[07:08:13] <pachet> like a weapon?
[07:08:20] <Deviad> yes. :P
[07:08:30] <STHayden> I've seen its low on ie7-8. I've heard reports of 9. I've tried to debug my site but I can't figure out what type of call might be causing it. part of the problem is that everyone who is reporting it (including me) have such vague reports that it's supper hard to take seriously
[07:08:48] <Deviad> As you can see the page slides down. And I want that to stay in place.
[07:09:15] <Deviad> But the script does its job as you can use the back button.
[07:09:19] <strykr> hooloovoo: http://pastebin.com/SdDvdt0W tried in ie6/ie8/ie9, with no luck on returning anything but 0
[07:09:42] <starpile> Anyone mind looking at this http://jsfiddle.net/bTJ6X/
[07:10:29] <hooloovoo> strykr: what if you just do console.log($(window).height())
[07:10:34] <STHayden> and I mean slow like a full second to get IE to render a CSS hover style with no JS attached. which is really weird
[07:10:47] <pachet> STHayden: IE9+ dev tools have the script profiler, you should run that against a page using only jquery and see if there's anything written in the tea leaves
[07:11:35] <pachet> STHayden: are you running in 64 or 32bit?
[07:11:47] <STHayden> ah. good idea. thanks patchet.
[07:11:59] <ajpiano> STHayden: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12522
[07:12:30] <Deviad> Any idea?
[07:12:34] <STHayden> I am running in 64.. but we had multiple complains from different customers.
[07:12:59] <STHayden> thanks for the bug link ajpiano
[07:13:18] <starsinmypockets> In chrome this adds <div id = "outer"> before the first div... I'm trying to wrap the two divs in the #outer div...
[07:14:01] <pachet> STHayden: well, i can't speak to whether jquery is contributing to your woes, but 64bit is a train wreck
[07:14:25] <pangelovski> patchet: problem solved jquery mobile: using latest 1.2 beta. jQuery  using latest 1.8.1
[07:15:00] <STHayden> yeah. I just wish I could be less vague atm.... I'm glad there is a bug and people are looking in to thing though :)
[07:15:32] <strykr> hooloovoo: LOG: 0
[07:15:47] <hooloovoo> weird...
[07:15:50] <hooloovoo> works for me
[07:15:57] <hooloovoo> you have a old jquery version?
[07:16:34] <Deviad> I found the solution to my problem here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1489624/modifying-document-location-hash-without-page-scrolling
[07:16:41] <Deviad> ;)
[07:16:52] <strykr> hooloovoo: currently using CDN version 1.8.1 < http://pastebin.com/SdDvdt0W is the basic code im using
[07:18:43] <hooloovoo> strykr: ok then go ugly. set it to a 500ms timeout and see if you get the height
[07:18:47] <hooloovoo> just to see if that's the problem
[07:19:08] <starpile> Fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/bTJ6X/1/
[07:20:11] <aJacom[ghost]> pachet, thanks, worked great
[07:22:08] <christo_m> Hello, does anyone know fullcalendar well enough to tell me how to do the following:
[07:22:21] <christo_m> Im resizing an event on top of another event, i want to grab the ID of the bottom event while im doing the resize
[07:22:39] <christo_m> as i have an eventResize callback that opens a dialog with some adjusted parameters, but i also require the ID of the event below it
[07:22:51] <christo_m> how would i grab the event?
[07:23:05] <christo_m> i do the following with eventRender
[07:23:41] <christo_m> http://pastebin.com/vAePMf7P
[07:24:04] <christo_m> the same does not work when i try element.resizable
[07:26:21] <coder7of9> greetings
[07:26:40] <itatitat> guys I have this simple code, why I have this error?, I have the properti id: https://gist.github.com/3722218
[07:27:42] <strykr> hooloovoo: nope, no go, very weird
[07:27:53] <coder7of9> how do i pass the event to a function when binding $('#id').change(function() { doFunc(event,this);});
[07:29:11] <itatitat> okok, fixed
[07:30:39] <strykr> hooloovoo: I worked out the problem damnit
[07:30:52] <strykr> help if i set doctype
[07:30:57] <pachet> coder7of9: just specify it in the anonymous function that you assign as the handler
[07:31:12] <pachet> $('#foo').on('change.mynamespace', function ( event ) { /* do stuff with event */ })
[07:31:33] <christo_m> anyone know what im talking about xD
[07:32:01] <hooloovoo> strykr: lol! sweet! =D
[07:32:11] <hooloovoo> strykr: good job! *high-5*
[07:32:33] <strykr> can't believe that was the prob, damn you quirks mode
[07:32:49] <sachh> hi
[07:32:55] <pachet> hi
[07:33:02] <sachh> how r u
[07:33:14] <pachet> still alive
[07:33:14] <kelye> hello, i have a strange problem with jquery
[07:33:16] <sachh> hi pachet
[07:33:28] <sachh> which problem
[07:33:34] <coder7of9> pachet thanks. i am using jq1.5  i do not believe on was invented then
[07:33:49] <sachh> what
[07:33:51] <kelye> when i submit a query through ajax it just turns the request red (in firebug) and no response is shown
[07:33:54] <coder7of9> using the syntax i provided is there a way to get the event
[07:33:56] <pachet> coder7of9: well, same concept applies
[07:34:07] <coder7of9> mmm i willtry thanks
[07:34:15] <pachet> $('#foo').change(function(event){-->
[07:34:19] <sachh> which type of response code is generate by server
[07:34:24] <kelye> if i use liveheaders to check headers .. no request is shown
[07:34:26] <kelye> t
[07:34:37] <kelye> that means no request is sent.. so what could be the reason this fails?
[07:35:30] <sachh> which language you have use ajax jquery + java php or other
[07:35:48] <pachet> kelye: are you passing in a function for the 'error' callback to $.ajax?
[07:36:06] <pachet> if so, what are the values for the second and third parameters
[07:36:41] <sachh> pachet which language u r use ajax
[07:36:49] <kelye> no, just dataType: json
[07:36:56] <kelye> beforeSubmit and success
[07:37:11] <pachet> kelye: assign something to the 'error' property on that object
[07:37:32] <kelye> how many params ?
[07:37:41] <pachet> error : function ( xhr, status, error ) { console.log(status); console.log(error); }
[07:38:09] <pachet> sachh: javascript?
[07:38:58] <sachh> pachet ok
[07:39:25] <sachh> through ajax what will u do
[07:39:26] <sachh> ?
[07:39:40] <sachh> call any php code javacode
[07:39:51] <sachh> any another operation
[07:40:03] <kelye> pachet: error , an empty  string
[07:40:03] <sachh> pachet r u there
[07:40:46] <pachet> i'm here in physical space, i'm definitely not here in terms of understanding what you're talking about
[07:40:49] <phelix> Is there a way anyone could help me try to troublshoot something? Soon as I added jquery.min.js 1.8.1 my superfish menu on the sliders they slide out but disapear before I can get my mouse over them. Any idea how I can trouble shoot this and figure out how to get it working properly?
[07:41:29] <sachh> are kay he eassy writing ahe ka?
[07:41:49] <kelye> i'm using http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js .. could it be something with that?
[07:42:27] <sachh> i don;t know for which perpose u r use ajax
[07:42:39] <sachh> kelye
[07:42:51] <pachet> kelye: not likely, probably just something iffy about how you have things set up
[07:43:08] <pachet> kelye: can you paste a demo somewhere?
[07:43:20] <kelye> it's just $(form).ajax(
[07:43:28] <kelye> and it worked till 20-30 mins ago
[07:43:40] <kelye> it works ok on my development server
[07:43:49] <sachh> then
[07:43:50] <kelye> and the code is the same
[07:44:04] <sachh> what happen
[07:44:28] <pachet> kelye: you're trying this on your production server? sounds like something's messed up with it
[07:44:57] <sachh> are ye lavdyano kay bolatay tumhi
[07:45:02] <en3r0> hello
[07:45:10] <sachh> helo
[07:45:17] <sachh> en3r0
[07:45:28] <sachh> en3r0 how r u
[07:45:42] <pachet> kelye: also i'll just point out that calling $.ajax on a jquery result object is definitely non-normative
[07:45:43] <sachh> u have any problem
[07:45:46] <en3r0> anyone know how i could reset a options list back to what the html lists, after modifying it?
[07:45:54] <en3r0> hello sachh
[07:45:58] <sachh> hi
[07:46:03] <pachet> i've never tried it, so i don't know how likely that is to introduce problems
[07:46:08] <sachh> what i u r problem
[07:46:34] <en3r0> sachh: i am attempting to "reset" an options list after removing items from it.
[07:46:42] <pachet> en3r0: well, you'd have to store the original options somewhere
[07:47:00] <sachh> u r use jquery ajax for change list value on one list box change
[07:47:19] <sachh> en3r0
[07:47:20] <en3r0> sachh: this is what i have so far - http://jsfiddle.net/VqTE5/
[07:47:35] <sachh> wait
[07:48:15] <sachh> so what problem occurs
[07:48:17] <pachet> en3r0: var $select = $('select'), $stored_options = $select.children().clone(); $select.empty().append('<option value="foo">foo</option>'); /* now it has the new option */ $select.empty().append($stored_options); /* and now you're back */
[07:48:45] <en3r0> sachh: if you select one date before another, those options will not come back
[07:49:01] <sachh> where u want implement this type of logic
[07:49:03] <en3r0> pachet: let me see if i can understand that =D
[07:49:23] <sachh> i know this is simple
[07:49:56] <sachh> no need to write this type of logic
[07:50:26] <pachet> en3r0: there are lots of different ways to accomplish the same thing -- see .detach(), for instance
[07:50:57] <en3r0> pachet: looking
[07:51:10] <sachh> call change event on list box and pass selected value to data
[07:51:25] <sachh> get data from server use ajax
[07:51:31] <pachet> sachh: you don't 'call' events on anything
[07:51:33] <pachet> events are triggered
[07:51:35] <sachh> or get data from json
[07:52:24] <pachet> granted you can manually .trigger an event, but thats only due to jquery having a stored reference to the event handler you assigned that its able to find
[07:52:25] <sachh> how is possible with out any event on list box
[07:57:48] <Imad> i have a json feed with prices how can i implement that with jquery so i dont have to manually put in the price?
[08:01:50] <Gho5t> wat
[08:02:16] <termite> Imad: so you want to take the json feed iterate over it and create elements and then add them to the DOM?
[08:03:32] <en3r0> sachh, pachet: I fixed the issue with hide and show
[08:06:21] <Imad> i have a json feed with prices how can i implement that with jquery so i dont have to manually put in the price?
[08:06:54] <Gho5t> lol
[08:06:59] <Gho5t> hellloooo
[08:07:04] <Gho5t> nope no echo in here
[08:08:22] <termite> nope no echo in here
[08:08:26] <Gho5t> wait
[08:08:45] <termite> wait wait wait
[08:10:45] <termite> Imad: do you want to build the html elements dynamically or are they on the page already.  Do you have something we can look at?
[08:12:09] <Gho5t> i have a json feed with prices how can i implement that with jquery so i dont have to manually put in the price?
[08:12:58] <Evandro-sl> Hello, I'd like to save a event in a var then call it later (after I unbind events)......... How can I save a event handler and keep it in a var?  : /
[08:13:21] <pachet> just assign it to a variable first, then use that variable when you bind to that event
[08:13:46] <pachet> var do_something = function ( event ) { ---> }; $('#foo').on('click.mynamespace', do_something);
[08:14:53] <kelye> just for the record
[08:15:07] <kelye> it was an segmentation fault on the live server :)
[08:15:13] <kelye> and no response returned
[08:15:55] <pachet> kelye: suspected it was something with the server :] glad you got it sorted out
[08:16:35] <burnt> hello, small problem wonder if I can get some help ... if I have a <lable> for an html elementwith a given known id, in an each() on the class of the html element, is their a simple way to get the lable text? would just be $('#lableid').text():?
[08:17:37] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  ahmm.. and if I use  $('#foo').unbind('click')  after I assigned to a var "do_something" , this var will not lost the event?
[08:18:28] <pachet> Evandro-sl: nope
[08:18:34] <pduersteler> When using a plugin like prettyCheckboxes, how do you ensure that they e.g. also work on elements loaded via modalbox? I currently have a method that encapsulates all .<someJQueryPluin>() calls and re-call that method (with a selector scope) on the body on page load and on a modal window / dynamically added content to apply. But this feels like being on the wrong way.
[08:18:40] <lahwran> I'd like to make some text shrink to fit its container if it's too long
[08:18:49] <pachet> Evandro-sl: although if you're using jquery 1.7+ i'd recommend using .off() in favor of .unbind()
[08:18:58] <lahwran> any idea how you'd do that?
[08:19:24] <lahwran> I was looking at shrinking the .width() repeatedly until it fits in the parent container, but it seems that the width *is* that of the parent container
[08:19:44] <pachet> lahwran: check if the container's innerWidth is greater than its outer
[08:20:03] <pachet> (assuming the container is given a fixed width)
[08:20:29] <lahwran> hm
[08:20:42] <pachet> pduersteler: yeah, that'd be the wrong way. just call that plugin method on the elements as they're added to the DOM
[08:21:13] <lahwran> that doesn't seem to be working, innerWidth is the same as width
[08:21:22] <lahwran> both are 220, the width of the parent container
[08:21:38] <pduersteler> pachet so I need to also call the plugins e.g. in my afterFinish's from the modal box and ajax calls, that's what you mean right?
[08:21:40] <lahwran> but the visible width of the element looks like double that
[08:21:50] <pachet> lahwran: can you post an example on jsfiddle.net?
[08:21:51] <pifantastic> lahwran: you could always abuse this: http://fittextjs.com/
[08:21:57] <pifantastic> and make the creators mad
[08:22:04] <lahwran> http://puu.sh/150f7
[08:22:14] <lahwran> pachet: oh, right, live is better than screenie I suppose
[08:22:24] <pachet> pduersteler: presumably, i havent seen your code so its hard for me to say where the best place for it is
[08:23:03] <pachet> just whatever function is called when the ajax request is successful, do it there or in a function called by that success handler
[08:23:28] <pduersteler> pachet but that's what I am doing right now ;) calling my "enableAllThePluginsFor('#dynamic-container')" on my afterFinish / onShow / … whatever ;)
[08:23:51] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  cause what I'm trying to do is,     first take evetns with   var events = $('#div').data('events'), then unbind  $('#div').unbind('click'), then after do things  trigger the assigned event .... and when I use unbind('#div')  the events saved in the var are also unbinded
[08:24:39] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  just ot clarify my situation : )
[08:25:35] <pachet> Evandro-sl: oh, that's because when you assign the result of data('events') to your variable, you're really just referencing the same object that jquery is going to loop through and remove things from
[08:25:39] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  I didn't know the off() , I'll take a look  (I'm a little bit newbie in Jquery, just used in some situations)
[08:25:41] <pachet> so you and jquery are looking at the same object
[08:25:54] <pachet> manually go through and select the ones you want from that events object
[08:26:15] <pachet> if you assign each handler to a new object, that object will be immune from jquery cleaning out the original
[08:26:22] <pachet> or look at ?.extend
[08:26:24] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  Yeap, and what I wanted is to save events, not just reference it : /
[08:26:35] <pachet> *$.extend
[08:26:36] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  hmmmm, interesting
[08:27:01] <lahwran> ooh! interesting
[08:27:16] <lahwran> this seems to be related to our stylesheets doing label { display: block; }
[08:27:19] <lahwran> I can't reproduce it without that
[08:27:44] <lahwran> http://jsfiddle.net/r84KB/2/
[08:28:24] <Evandro-sl> pachet:  Well I'll take a look at what you suggested, thank you very much, It will help me a lot ; )
[08:28:29] <Evandro-sl> pachet++
[08:28:34] <pachet> Evandro-sl: yw
[08:28:57] <lahwran> this is most like my environment: http://jsfiddle.net/r84KB/5/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/r84KB/4/

[08:50:44] <Deviad> I put my question in there. I hope someone will answer.
[08:52:43] <peterschmidler> I have an event that maps mouse wheel scrolling to horizontal scrolling. How can I remove the event? $('body').mousewheel(function(event, delta) {this.scrollLeft -= (delta * 30); event.preventDefault();});
[08:57:35] <pachet> peterschmidler: did you try $('body').off('mousewheel')?
[08:59:52] <CharlieM75> is there a way to accomplish this that works in more recent versions of jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/R9auG/71/ (start with an empty select when empty is not an option)
[09:00:06] <peterschmidler> pachet: thx
[09:01:24] <termite> peterschmidler:are you using the mouse wheel plugin?
[09:01:37] <peterschmidler> termite: yes
[09:02:27] <termite> peterschmidler: open up the code and see how they bind.  If they use bind then you need to use unbind.  If they use .on then you need to use .offf
[09:03:39] <peterschmidler> termite: thx
[09:04:22] <peterschmidler> Strange it doesn't work on windows...
[09:06:21] <termite> peterschmidler: scrolling or unbinding
[09:06:52] <peterschmidler> scrolling

[09:11:13] <NodeX> anyone know a good workaround for blurred bg images on mobiles?
[09:13:05] <termite> NodeX: what format are you using
[09:13:39] <termite> for the images
[09:14:16] <NodeX> png
[09:14:21] <NodeX> it's blurred :/
[09:14:38] <NodeX> I assume the browser is trying to scale it or something
[09:15:38] <termite> NodeX: Hmm set it to repeating and see if its still blury
[09:16:36] <NodeX> still blurre
[09:16:38] <NodeX> d*
[09:16:43] <termite> NodeX: I haven't really run into this issue before
[09:17:01] <termite> what device or it is all of them
[09:17:06] <NodeX> Htc one x
[09:17:38] <termite> is it blured on others also
[09:17:58] <termite> what version of the os are you running
[09:18:28] <NodeX> ICS and yes
[09:18:34] <NodeX> it's not the phone or the OS lol
[09:18:51] <NodeX> it's a wide known problem for BG images in mobile browsers
[09:18:59] <termite> I was going to grab the same phone and see if I could dup it
[09:19:29] <NodeX> I'm going to make an image 10 times the size and scale it in the html to see if that works
[09:22:53] <termite> stupid question what is the DPI on the image
[09:24:14] <NodeX> normal web dpi, 72 or w/e
[09:24:27] <NodeX> whatever photoshop exports as
[09:24:36] <pachet> it varies :[
[09:24:58] <Eviltwin> NodeX: http://menacingcloud.com/?c=highPixelDensityDisplays
[09:26:17] <NodeX> Ok so one way round it was to make an image 10 times the size and scale it in CSS
[09:26:33] <pachet> why 10
[09:26:55] <NodeX> why not ,lol
[09:27:00] <pachet> bandwidth
[09:27:07] <NodeX> thought 10 might cover retina displays
[09:27:14] <termite> Or you can detect the size and resolution and request assets based on that
[09:27:16] <NodeX> 10times is 27k for the image lol
[09:28:56] <termite> Eviltwin: you beat me to the bunch with that link
[09:29:37] <pachet> Eviltwin packs a mean bunch
[09:30:56] <termite> he is truly evin

[09:31:12] <ShadowChancellor> Hey guys, I have a question:
[09:31:35] <ShadowChancellor> I'd like to watch a DOM element and trigger an event whenever its visibility changes
[09:32:08] <ShadowChancellor> What is the best way to do this?
[09:32:27] <ShadowChancellor> I'm thinking about extending the is() method
[09:32:41] <NodeX> Forget all that crap in the link. Make an image for the largest size you need and scale it in CSS with "background-size" - it works on every mobile browser I have tested so far - only works for BG images though ;)
[09:34:12] <termite> background-size does' work for opera mini if I recall
[09:40:40] <NodeX> it's only the site logo - not to bothered tbh
[09:41:35] <Hilton> Hi! Using .autocomplete, how can I have a change-like event fire as soon as a user clicks an item in the list, rather than waiting to lose focus?
[09:42:29] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: there are many autocomplete libraries out there, which one specifically have you chosen to use?
[09:42:35] <Hilton> jquery-ui
[09:42:53] <hazamonzo__> heys folks. Who can reccomend a good jqueryui library for all sorts of selects (drops downs, multi selects ect). I've been googling for a little while and found a few but i would like to find one that does many of these things. Not a library for multi select and another for single selects ect. Just looking for recommendations :)
[09:43:20] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: see ?docs
[09:43:24] <bot-t> Hilton, Main Page - The references on docs.jquery.com are obsolete. Please see http://api.jquery.com for up-to-date documentation. http://docs.jquery.com/
[09:43:27] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[09:43:37] <ryanneufeld> Look under events tab

[09:44:56] <ShadowChancellor> select2 is a good jquery plugin
[09:44:58] <ShadowChancellor> http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[09:44:58] <Hilton> Maybe. I changed change: to select: and now it won't select items :P
[09:45:30] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: you probably want both
[09:45:40] <hazamonzo__> ShadowChancellor: I guess that was for me? :)
[09:45:45] <hazamonzo__> ShadowChancellor: And it looks great!
[09:45:47] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: without seeing your code I can't advise you further
[09:45:50] <ShadowChancellor> yup ;)
[09:47:08] <hazamonzo__> ShadowChancellor: Cheers! I saw Dropkick and JQuery Multi select. They both did what i wanted. but i didn't want two libraries :)
[09:48:17] <Hilton> http://jsfiddle.net/d6BjN/ - basically, my autocomplete list consists of "IDSTRING - Long identifying name" for ease of use, but the field is to only have IDSTRING in it, hence the split. Then three other fields are loaded with data.
[09:48:29] <Hilton> I would like this to happen as soon as an item is selected, not on lost focus.
[09:48:58] <ShadowChancellor> hazamonzo_: Yeah select2 basically does all of that. It's really great. Hopefully, it works for you!
[09:49:37] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: can you update that fiddle with some html. It's impossible to see what you're doing here.
[09:50:02] <hazamonzo__> ShadowChancellor: Looks great mate. Cheers!
[09:50:06] <Hilton> oof thats a lot of things to add...
[09:50:29] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: you don't need the whole page. Just enough to replicate the problem
[09:50:49] <SparK_BR> That awkward moment when you're scuba diving and you see Adele rolling in the deep.
[09:50:59] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:51:37] <Hilton> ryanneufeld: I know, that's the hard part. A lot of programatically created lists, etc.

[09:55:17] <Guest24708> i have a input element with 2_10_555.0_0_seat as id....when i do $('#'+ipname) i dont get any elements
[09:55:25] <Guest24708> can anyone tell me what am i missing
[09:55:46] <Guest24708> when ipname = "2_10_555.0_0_seat"
[09:57:01] <hackeron> hey, I'm trying to get the href of every link on a page, I'm doing: $("a").each -> alert($(this).href) -- but every result shows "undefined" - what am I doing wrong?
[09:58:53] <Hilton> .attr('href') ?
[09:59:00] <microhxo> Is it possible to UpdateTargetId with a Plain old $.ajax ???
[09:59:22] <microhxo> Or will i have to do it manually?
[10:00:05] <Guest24708> i have a input element with 2_10_555.0_0_seat as id....when i do $('#2_10_555.0_0_seat') i dont get any elements..plain javascript when i do document.getElementById('2_7_555.0_0_seat')..i can see the element..what am i doing wrong
[10:00:21] <hackeron> Hilton: ah, that worked! - weird, in the console I can do $('a')[0].href
[10:01:18] <Hilton> Yay, I helped!
[10:02:11] <termite> hackeron:http://jsfiddle.net/PtLkt/1/
[10:02:36] <hackeron> termite: ah, so this.href instead of $(this).href
[10:03:31] <Oona_> why does my div doesnt change color? http://jsfiddle.net/3UJvr/
[10:03:51] <Guest24708> i have a input element with 2_10_555.0_0_seat as id....when i do $('#2_10_555.0_0_seat') i dont get any elements..plain javascript when i do document.getElementById('2_7_555.0_0_seat')..i can see the element..what am i doing wrong
[10:04:05] <NoiseEee> Oona_: if you're going to make a js fiddle, put the html there too, and load jquery :\
[10:04:06] <termite> Guest24708: kill the . in the id
[10:04:25] <termite> it thinks your referencing a class
[10:04:51] <Guest24708> termite: let me try that..
[10:04:52] <Hilton> ryanneufeld: I've put in everything relevant, but it won't work in the demo... the ID field should pop up an autocomplete list. http://jsfiddle.net/d6BjN/2/
[10:05:04] <tommarshall> Guest24708: the . in the id is the problem you need to remove it, otherwise jQuery will treat the second half of the id as ajoining class
[10:06:04] <Hilton> On my end, I get the autocomplete list, but after I changed the event from change to select, the list won't disappear or update the field.
[10:06:45] <termite> Hilton: are you returning false
[10:07:53] <Guest24708> termite, tommarshal...thanks for your inputs..thats the problem..anyway i could bypass jquery not to treat that way..i dont get to have control over the id being generated
[10:08:39] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: you have an unexpect end of input error.
[10:09:00] <termite> Guest24708: find the person that does and beat him with a hammer till he changes it
[10:09:04] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: go here
[10:09:09] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: and paste your code in
[10:10:27] <Guest24708> termite : :) i will probably do that..i was just wondering if we can add any escape character
[10:10:48] <Oona_> why does my "li' doesn't change color? http://jsfiddle.net/3UJvr/1/
[10:11:32] <starpile>  /join #django
[10:11:33] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: you had a syntax error, and no css. I've added the css and fixed the syntax error: http://jsfiddle.net/d6BjN/3/
[10:11:36] <starpile> ups
[10:11:57] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: look at the error console. and start playing around
[10:12:44] <Hilton> I don't see any changes in your version except formatting. No extra CSS.
[10:15:02] <Hilton> Anyway, it still isn't working - clicking an item in the list doesn't do anything at all, not even make the list disappear.
[10:17:18] <ryanneufeld> Hilton: did you look at the console?
[10:17:22] <ryanneufeld> There is errors there
[10:17:30] <ryanneufeld> that would likely tell you where to start looking

[10:42:05] <hlve> afternoon gents
[10:42:29] <Zzaichik> So! What is the best parallax plugin?
[10:45:06] <HughAJWood> @Zzaichik very broad what do you want it to acheive or just the coolest?
[10:45:16] <hlve> shoky, i'm kinda revisiting that city/state autocomplete by zip. any suggestions on where to start?
[10:45:47] <optraz> HughAJWood: i have jquery.. does the slickback use jquery or what?
[10:46:07] <hlve> well i guess not so much aimed at shoky. for anyone who wants to help
[10:46:19] <Zzaichik> HughAJWood: just the coolest I guess. I mean just the best one as far as options and effect.
[10:46:47] <HughAJWood> ~optraz it uses jquery, backbone.js and slickgrid
[10:46:47] <Zzaichik> I've used a couple, I'm just wondering if anyone else has a parallax script they've used and like.
[10:47:49] <optraz> HughAJWood: any good example url ?
[10:47:51] <HughAJWood> @ZZaichik Scrolldeck is cool its a snail pace background instead of fixed
[10:47:52] <b-ot> HughAJWood, memorised â€œScrolldeckâ€.

[10:53:20] <optraz> HughAJWood: okay, thanks, i will check it out later. but can i ask, how do i refresh / reload / (watever word that used) an existing table?
[10:53:29] <optraz> i have the exsiting table using id table_foo
[10:53:51] <optraz> i use $('#table_foo').html(data)
[10:53:52] <optraz> dont work
[10:56:55] <HughAJWood> @array of data or a single element?
[10:57:05] <optraz> @array of data in json
[10:58:13] <HughAJWood> @optraz then something like $('#table_foo tr').each(function(i) {$this.find('td').html(array[i]); }); just go in each dimension if its multi dimensioned thats only for a single column
[10:58:54] <optraz> HughAJWood: very cool..
[10:58:59] <optraz> let me try, hold on..
[10:59:06] <HughAJWood> sorry $(this) typo
[10:59:48] <optraz> HughAJWood: can you show again the code?
[11:00:19] <HughAJWood> $('#table_foo tr').each(function(i) {$(this).find('td').html(array[i]); });

Here's an example of what I mean: http://pastebin.com/VEHYHySS
[11:04:23] <cjhmdm> sorry, please see this one instead.. had a mistake in the other one: http://pastebin.com/4HKqYULc
[11:05:08] <optraz> HughAJWood: you there?
[11:05:19] <HughAJWood> @optrax http://jsfiddle.net/vKPTa/7/
[11:05:24] <HughAJWood> optraz
[11:05:29] <cjhmdm> basically, when i hover over the 'trophy-container' div, I want it to display the hidden 'trophy' element of that div. But currently, it ends up making all of the 'trophy' elements show instead of just the one
[11:06:08] <HughAJWood> @optraz you don't need the iife i just did it to explain i for you
[11:06:37] <cjhmdm> I've also tried this but it doesn't seem to work either: $(this).next('.trophy').removeClass('inactive');
[11:07:16] <optraz> HughAJWood: }).done(function(data) {  ($('#foo tr').each(function(i) {$(this).find('td').html(newarray[i]); }))(0); });
[11:07:19] <optraz> is that correct?
[11:11:46] <optraz> HughAJWood: are you there?
[11:12:33] <hazamonzo__> hmm, this might be insane but... say i attached a function to an item $('#myselect').select2();  <--- thats some selector library... if there a way to set options for that select BEFORE its execute. Maybe use some jquery to get the #myselect and say, when i call .select2()... use these options for .select2()...
[11:12:36] <hazamonzo__> Is that insane?
[11:14:16] <pachet> hazamonzo__: its a little insane, why can't you just add them before you call that function?
[11:15:27] <hazamonzo__> pachet: I don't have much control over the function. This function is integarted into another application and i get the option to choose what function i want to use. When i choose it, its fine and works. But im trying to figure how i might use some pre execution javascript to send option to that function when it loads. If that makes sense? :)
[11:15:49] <HughAJWood> @optraz sorry was eating here http://jsfiddle.net/vKPTa/25/
[11:16:45] <pachet> hazamonzo__: its ugly, but can you just wrap that call in another function and use that instead?
[11:17:13] <pachet> $.fn.add_some_options = function ( options_to_add ) { $(this).append(options_to_add).select2(); return this; };
[11:17:28] <optraz> HughAJWood: thanks.. but that version 25 dont show any output?
[11:19:01] <monstordh> If I'm creating a set of list items from other elements in an .each() function, how do I wrap it with the <ul> element? http://jsfiddle.net/monstordh/bUTpn/
[11:19:26] <hazamonzo__> pachet: hmmm, im not sure i have that control. Liek i said, in this application i get an option. I can select what 3rd party lib i want to use for a selector (chosen.js and some other one). The only thing i can choose is a preset name (looked at the js code of the application and ig goes something like if(whatever=="chosen")   ). Then the application does the work... $(#whatever).chosen();
[11:19:49] <hazamonzo__> pachet: just read what you said above... looks interesting
[11:19:52] <HughAJWood> @optraz take out the =0 sorry I put that in so you understood, that only works in ff
[11:19:59] <HughAJWood> = 0
[11:20:11] <HughAJWood> http://jsfiddle.net/vKPTa/28/
[11:20:20] <HughAJWood> yeah looks right
[11:22:01] <optraz> HughAJWood: newarray is in javascript array? but the data im passing back is dataType json in this }).done(function(data) {
[11:22:28] <optraz> HughAJWood: when i chagne newarray to data, the firebug complaint data[i] is undefined
[11:22:47] <HughAJWood> same principle just get json with jquery you will get your data as an array
[11:23:29] <optraz> HughAJWood: sorry, what should i do ?
[11:23:37] <optraz> HughAJWood: i mean the chagnes i need to done?
[11:23:42] <hazamonzo__> pachet: you want to see this crazy application? Might explain it a little better?
[11:26:39] <HughAJWood> @optraz if your using http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ and check your json returned type, it may be objects not an array
[11:27:07] <optraz> HughAJWood: in my php code, i did echo json_encode($data);
[11:28:56] <HughAJWood> @optraz that doesn't mean a lot, get into firebug, look at your returned json, check its json datatype (get firebug json explorer it rocks) and go from there on how you have to traverse the data, as a non associative array is best
[11:29:06] <optraz> HughAJWood: when i do in php gettype($data) is an array.
[11:31:49] <optraz> HughAJWood: when i check in firebug -> console -> All, it show this [{"id":"1","foo":"val1"},{"id":"2","foo":"val2"}]
[11:35:36] <HughAJWood> @optraz example: http://jsfiddle.net/9gVbP/
[11:36:25] <HughAJWood> @optraz if you do an associative array you will have to do a little more work to populate your table because you are using objects
[11:36:25] <b-ot> HughAJWood, no YOU ARE using objects
[11:38:27] <optraz> HughAJWood: thanks for the link.
[11:38:38] <HughAJWood> no danger
[11:39:06] <optraz> HughAJWood: if in the php server side script, i dont echo json_encode
[11:39:10] <optraz> would it make any simpler?
[11:39:38] <HughAJWood> does it have to be an associative array in php?
[11:41:14] <optraz> HughAJWood: answer is yes, i need assocative array
[11:44:23] <optraz> HughAJWood: well, the dataType is of Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)
[11:44:29] <optraz> maybe i woudl just return html instead
[11:44:48] <optraz> and in the presentation layer, i use the jquery to replace the table row..
[11:45:39] <optraz> HughAJWood: what you think?
[11:46:51] <Hopsy> how do I $(this) inside $.ajax?
[11:47:11] <SparK_BR> var self = this;
[11:47:34] <Hopsy> I am doing like this: var _this = this;
[11:47:40] <SparK_BR> $.ajax({ success: function(answer){ $(self)!
[11:48:09] <Hopsy> success: function(load) { $(_this).attr('src', 'someimage.jpg');
[11:48:15] <SparK_BR> works?
[11:48:19] <Hopsy> no
[11:48:33] <Hopsy> when I do it outside of ajax it works
[11:48:48] <SparK_BR> the var _this = this; must be outside ajax
[11:49:01] <Hopsy> thats outside
[11:49:25] <hlve> Hey guys, question
[11:49:39] <hlve> actually. one sec. gunna set this up in jsfiddle first
[11:52:20] <Hopsy> SparK_BR: now it works :p
[11:53:02] <SparK_BR> Hopsy, what did you do?
[11:53:05] <optraz> how do i replace all the html of class foo with data?
[11:53:11] <optraz> HughAJWood: ^^ if you know..
[11:53:26] <SparK_BR> $(".foo").html(data);
[11:53:35] <Hopsy> the ajax request got an error
[11:53:42] <SparK_BR> lol
[11:53:50] <SparK_BR> success: wasn't even running
[11:53:56] <Hopsy> indeed
[11:56:55] <optraz> SparK_BR: what's .html?
[11:57:49] <NoiseEee> the markup language that's taking the world by storm
[11:58:12] <SparK_BR> is a function of the jquery object
[11:58:37] <SparK_BR> that changes the content of the selected element with the html code inside parentesis
[11:59:02] <optraz> i see..
[11:59:05] <optraz> maybe i want replacewith..
[12:00:13] <NoiseEee> "how do i replace all the html of class foo with data?"  what does that mean optraz?  you want to remove the class "foo" from elements and give it a class "data" ?
[12:00:14] <pachet> optraz: replaceWith replaces the element you call it on, not just its contents
[12:00:28] <NoiseEee> optraz: think your question needs to be more specific
[12:02:03] <optraz> NoiseEee: pachet my original goal is that, when success in ajax post request, i want the table to refresh with new information.
[12:04:20] <NoiseEee> optraz: this is very easy and well documented over the webz
[12:04:42] <optraz> NoiseEee: not that i can find a realible source.
[12:04:46] <optraz> been there.. trust me
[12:04:48] <optraz> gogole many times
[12:04:50] <optraz> google
[12:05:28] <NoiseEee> optraz: well break it up into steps. what kind of information are you getting back?  what do you want to update in your table?
[12:06:27] <NoiseEee> xhr.done(function(data) { $('#thingInDocument').text(data.textToInsert); })  kind of thing
[12:06:47] <hlve> Hey guys. How can I get this to function properly in any version of IE? http://jsfiddle.net/rL95V/
[12:07:04] <hlve> It's supposed to autocomplete City / State by the ZIP. It works just fine in Firefox/Chrome/Safari.
[12:07:13] <hlve> But for whatever reason, it's not working in IE.
[12:07:23] <hlve> Not hitting a breaking point that I can see either
[12:07:42] <optraz> NoiseEee: im getting information back to the client browser in json type. no update, just that when user select a drop down, the data is sent to a php server and get new data.
[12:07:55] <NoiseEee> optraz: ok... and now you want to do what
[12:08:23] <optraz> NoiseEee: well, the replaceWith works for me... :) i regenerate the whole table and then calling in the ajax success replaceWith()
[12:08:39] <NoiseEee> ?cc
[12:08:43] <hlve> Anyone/ o.o
[12:08:51] <NoiseEee> great optraz, have a nice day
[12:09:40] <arielserafini> hlve, checking
[12:10:04] <optraz> yea.. work at 3.09am.. something to cheer up.. but im gonna use the slicktable a guy called Hugh something.. or the datatable..
[12:10:13] <hlve> thanks arielserafini
[12:10:46] <hlve> I was told I may have to use 'JSON2"
[12:10:49] <hlve> I don't even know what that is
[12:11:36] <Gho5t> JSON3 would probably work better
[12:11:43] <Gho5t> or JSONP90X
[12:11:45] <hlve> lol
[12:12:01] <arielserafini> json3 has some compatibility issues
[12:12:08] <hlve> i just can't fathom why it works in every other browser, and in IE, it just sits there and ignores
[12:12:15] <arielserafini> luckily 4.1b will address that
[12:13:42] <Gho5t> yeah if you add the f90 extension
[12:13:53] <Gho5t> everyone forgets that
[12:14:04] <hlve> o_O?
[12:14:23] <arielserafini> hlve, just messing around
[12:14:28] <arielserafini> still investigating your fiddle
[12:14:30] <arielserafini> very weird
[12:14:49] <SparK_BR> instead of {itens:[{name:"one",age:55,whatever:"shit"},{name:"two",age:80,whatever:"big deal... NOT"}]},
[12:14:50] <SparK_BR> use {head:["name","age","whatever"],itens:[["one",55,"shit"],["two",80,"big deal... NOT"]]}
[12:14:50] <SparK_BR> that's what "json2" means
[12:14:52] <hlve> i've tried the xdr fix, as well as the CORS fix, to see if it was a cross domain scripting issue
[12:15:04] <hlve> didn't do anything
[12:15:10] <BillCriswell> I'm so annoyed by this "API" I'm working on... it puts out data that should be arrays as the string "[foo, bar, baz]"
[12:16:44] <hlve> hmph
[12:22:57] <hlve> arielserafini, anything?
[12:23:02] <hlve> Or is this a lost cost? lol
[12:23:06] <arielserafini> still looking :/
[12:23:15] <hlve> really appreciate it
[12:23:51] <hlve> if it helps any, the ajax error handler indicates that in IE the ajax is erroring out, but we've already figured that part out lol
[12:24:03] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/rL95V/2/ (updated CSS to show the class success/error)
[12:26:25] <arielserafini> god, jsfiddle keeps eating my double quotes
[12:29:47] <hlve> lol
[12:29:52] <hlve> editing jsfiddle in IE is a nightmare
[12:29:53] <hlve> ;(
[12:30:10] <hlve> Was able to have it output the errorThrown
[12:30:15] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/rL95V/4/
[12:30:18] <hlve> No transport
[12:31:55] <hlve> and if I apply the cors fix to seee if it's a cross domain scripting issue, the errorThrown turns to Access is Denied
[12:32:00] <hlve> shoky, care to weigh on this again?
[12:32:00] <hlve> lol
[12:32:10] <hlve> It's a late Friday-day project that I'm hoping to complete
[12:32:29] <NoiseEee> what cors fix?
[12:32:35] <hlve> jQuery.support.cors = true;
[12:32:44] <NoiseEee> iirc IE doesn't support CORS until at least 9
[12:32:45] <hlve> to enable cross domain scripting
[12:32:49] <hlve> I'm trying in IE9
[12:32:57] <hlve> IE9 is where i'm having the issue
[12:32:57] <hlve> lol
[12:33:03] <hlve> I'm sure the issue is the same IN 8
[12:34:20] <shoky> hy
[12:34:35] <hlve> Heya
[12:34:36] <hlve> Shoky!
[12:34:39] <shoky> sap
[12:34:42] <hlve> care to weigh on this again?
[12:34:43] <hlve> lol
[12:35:01] <shoky> mmm what's this
[12:35:15] <hlve> The city/state autocompletion from zip
[12:35:20] <hlve> I tried from another source
[12:35:44] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/rL95V/4/ works in firefox/chrome/safari, not in IE. I was able to get the ErrorThrown, when have the support.cors = true, I'm getting "Access Denied". Without that, I'm getting the "No Transport"
[12:35:58] <shoky> oh IE ;(
[12:36:55] <shoky> well didn't we go through this?
[12:37:06] <arielserafini> i get an access denied error
[12:37:08] <hlve> we did, and I couldn't find a localized version of this
[12:37:10] <arielserafini> on ie9
[12:37:25] <hlve> right arielserafini, just read up on that and saw this solution here. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5087549/access-denied-to-jquery-script-on-ie
[12:37:28] <hlve> I wonder if that's something
[12:37:35] <hlve> this xdr = new domain request thing
[12:38:00] <arielserafini> god
[12:38:03] <hlve> but I don't really know how to incorperate xdr into this
[12:38:04] <hlve> lol
[12:38:13] <arielserafini> that's just plain ugly
[12:38:25] <arielserafini> and kind of defeats the purpose of jQuery, don't it?
[12:38:27] <arielserafini> :/
[12:38:34] <hlve> lol
[12:40:10] <shoky> hlve did you try just including the xdr transport js?
[12:40:45] <hlve> just the latter code under reference with the modified url?
[12:41:19] <optraz> how do i check if foo, bar or , baz ? $('.foo .bar .baz').anyfunction() ?
[12:42:30] <arielserafini> optraz, hasClass ?
[12:42:42] <arielserafini> wait
[12:43:06] <arielserafini> do you mean $(".foo, .bar, .baz") ?
[12:43:31] <optraz> waht is , means?
[12:43:54] <optraz> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[12:44:34] <arielserafini> optraz, is that what you're trying to do? match foo OR bar OR baz?
[12:45:01] <arielserafini> hlve, you could probably solve that using a server-side proxy :/
[12:45:10] <arielserafini> i know it's kinda ugly
[12:45:12] <shoky> hlve: yeah it works..
[12:45:21] <hlve> Shoky, wasn't able to get it to work here
[12:45:22] <hlve> lol
[12:45:24] <hlve> o_O
[12:45:29] <shoky> hlve: http://jsfiddle.net/rL95V/6/
[12:45:42] <hlve> OMG
[12:45:44] <hlve> I love you.
[12:45:46] <shoky> ;p
[12:46:08] <hlve> Thank you!
[12:46:13] <shoky> np
[12:47:02] <optraz> arielserafini: yes, i need the , selector. i have a few drop down and i want if any of the drop down is change, the jquery code is trigger.
[12:47:05] <optraz> thanks.
[12:47:59] <arielserafini> optraz, did that solve your problem?
[12:48:09] <optraz> yes
[12:48:13] <optraz> perfectly
[12:48:21] <shoky> hlve: i added crossDomain:true  but you don't need it, btw
[12:48:55] <arielserafini> :)
[12:52:21] <hlve> Ah. roadblock.
[12:52:32] <hlve> It's getting the access is denied when I try ti implement the exact same code on my site
[12:52:33] <hlve> lol
[12:53:15] <hlve> ughhhh lol. This sucks.
[12:53:16] <hazamonzo__> hmm, this might be crazy. But say i have a function like .chosen()... It can take a laod of properties... In this case i can't set the properties when .chosen is fired. Is there a default jquery way, to set the default properties for a fucntion?
[12:53:29] <hazamonzo__> Trying to google it but im not sure exactly what im looking for
[12:53:51] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, how are you firing your function? do you have a fiddle?
[12:54:38] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: Im afraid i have very little control over this .chosen() function. I can only execute it with no properties. This is why im hoping i can define so pre execution JS to set the default properties list for this function
[12:54:42] <hazamonzo__> If that makes sense?
[12:55:27] <hlve> shoky, almost :(. this thing is going to be the death of me.
[12:56:37] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, you can test for arguments.length
[12:56:47] <arielserafini> inside your function code
[12:57:10] <hazamonzo__> hmm, im not sure how that might help me im afraid :s
[12:57:27] <arielserafini> if no arguments are passed along, use default values
[12:57:32] <hazamonzo__> let me see if i can create something with jsfiddle
[13:00:22] <hlve> well. this sucks.
[13:00:27] <hlve> I really thought this was about to work lol
[13:02:17] <arielserafini> hlve, :/
[13:02:46] <hlve> it was working in jsfiddle, but stopped working when I tried taking the example and applying it to my site
[13:02:54] <hlve> It's back to the "access is denied"
[13:03:34] <arielserafini> what about a server side proxy?
[13:03:46] <hlve> really want to avoid that, it's a sign up page with cc info. lol.
[13:04:08] <arielserafini> what do you mean?
[13:04:19] <arielserafini> i mean proxy only the zip request
[13:04:40] <hlve> Eh
[13:04:47] <arielserafini> i know it's not pretty
[13:04:49] <arielserafini> :/
[13:05:07] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i a file there is a function function execute() with in that function this.executeScript = function()...............   how can i call executeScript from outside function execute?
[13:05:22] <hlve> I wonder if it's something that it's in my webconfig that's stopping cross domain
[13:06:10] <arielserafini> Krambiorix, you can't unless you make that inner function "public"
[13:06:45] <Krambiorix> arielserafini, ok, if i make it public, how can i call it?
[13:06:55] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: Ever used the chosen.js library ?
[13:07:16] <arielserafini> Krambiorix,  if you add a return statement to that execute function at the end
[13:07:19] <arielserafini> return { executeScript: executeScript }
[13:07:33] <arielserafini> you can probably use execute().executeScript()
[13:07:50] <arielserafini> or you can add executeScript to the window object, which is bad and uglt
[13:07:52] <arielserafini> ugly*
[13:07:55] <arielserafini> (but works)
[13:08:08] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, nope
[13:09:09] <Krambiorix> arielserafini, ok i'll look into that thx!
[13:09:26] <hazamonzo__> :)
[13:09:37] <arielserafini> Krambiorix, if you make a jsfiddle we can probably help you more
[13:09:45] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, why do you ask?
[13:10:14] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: oh its just the plugin im playing with. That i mentioned earlier
[13:10:26] <hazamonzo__> im trying to get a jsfiddle created :)
[13:10:58] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, oh, i've looked at chosen before for a project. it looks pretty cool
[13:11:21] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: Its very cool indeed. Im just trying to get control of it within this third par application im using :)
[13:11:42] <shoky> hlve: are you accessing it on localhost?
[13:12:55] <hazamonzo__> Am i being blind and not able to see a list of available fucntion properties on this page? http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[13:13:08] <shoky> hlve: er nvm
[13:13:15] <hlve> shoky, yes
[13:13:29] <hlve> I'm wondering if there's something I need to change in my webconfig
[13:16:51] <shoky> don't think so.. works fine for me hosting it locally too
[13:18:51] <shoky> i only get the access denied msg when i try it with the local file (file://...)
[13:21:28] <David_Bradbury> Are you able to do something like $("#select-id").on('click', 'option', function(e) {}); ? It doesn't seem to work, and using "change" isn't desired due to it being a select list of font sizes, and if they click the same size more than once, it won't show up
[13:24:05] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/blob/master/chosen/chosen.jquery.js
[13:24:12] <arielserafini> do a search for this.options
[13:25:50] <hlve> hm
[13:26:26] <arielserafini> David_Bradbury, make a jsfiddle
[13:26:57] <shoky> David_Bradbury: handling clicks on options is known to be wonky
[13:27:26] <Eviltwin> Bordering on insane
[13:28:36] <sk8ball> hey folks - as far as CMS's go which do you all reccommend - Wordpress, Joomla, ... other? (i come from a primarily asp.net/c# background - and custom web design here and there.) A client of mine wants me to implement a CMS for his site and I'm trying to decide which offers the best trade-off from a developer vs client perspective?
[13:28:52] <sk8ball> reccommendations - and why?
[13:29:07] <ayente> hello all
[13:29:15] <pifantastic> sk8ball: it all depends on what the site is
[13:29:28] <pifantastic> so think about the requirements of the site long and hard
[13:29:29] <sk8ball> im usually doing lots of enterprise apps lots of database stuff that sort of thing
[13:29:39] <sk8ball> once in awhle i moonlight as a web designer
[13:29:52] <hlve> Just emailed the creators, shoky. Maybe they'll have some input
[13:29:52] <sk8ball> pif, its a small business web presence
[13:30:09] <shoky> hlve: creators of what?
[13:30:17] <ayente> i have a problem for convert protype javascript to jquery with syntax  of .css
[13:30:19] <sk8ball> he wants to basically just update the content of a few pages text/pic-wise
[13:30:20] <arielserafini> the universe, obviously
[13:30:26] <hlve> zippopotamus
[13:30:27] <shoky> ;p
[13:30:29] <hlve> ;p
[13:30:30] <arielserafini> they have all the answers
[13:30:36] <Krambiorix> arielserafini, can you help me on this? var field = $('input[type=file]', form).get(0); -> this i understand, but then this: var  files = field.files; how can a field have files??
[13:30:44] <hlve> It doesn't really make any sense why it wouldn't work on the site itself, but works in jsfiddle
[13:30:53] <hlve> like... nothing is different.
[13:31:07] <hlve> and it's getting that access is denied crap.
[13:31:09] <shoky> hlve: got a live link? or pastebin..
[13:31:15] <David_Bradbury> Not working in Chrome at all - http://jsfiddle.net/M69s3/
[13:31:28] <shoky> cause it should work fine if you copied the code exactly
[13:31:53] <shoky> David_Bradbury: right, seek an alternative
[13:31:58] <hlve> shoky, it's an aspx site, I could pastebin but really nothing is different
[13:32:06] <hlve> I changed around some of the id names. that's about it
[13:32:37] <sk8ball> pifantastic, its a small business web presence site - they want to do content updates (mainly text, some pics)
[13:32:47] <sk8ball> nothing complicated
[13:32:58] <hlve> shoky, http://pastebin.com/XfFVCz7c
[13:33:04] <hlve> nothing is different lol
[13:33:29] <Krambiorix> anyone else? var field = $('input[type=file]', form).get(0); -> this i understand, but then this: var  files = field.files; how can a field have files??
[13:33:40] <arielserafini> Krambiorix, i have no idea about that
[13:33:55] <arielserafini> looking at that code, field would be a jQuery object
[13:34:10] <arielserafini> and I don't know of a .files property
[13:34:20] <shoky> hlve: don't do $.support.cors = true
[13:34:47] <arielserafini> Krambiorix, again, if you make a jsfiddle I can help you better
[13:34:55] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix / arielserafini: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications
[13:35:05] <hlve> same error
[13:35:11] <bluesnow> Hi, I'm wondering what custom events in Javascript are really used for.
[13:35:25] <bluesnow> Do they mostly pass custom data to an event handler when something like onclick happens?
[13:35:26] <ayente> ".setStyle( 'right:' + ( $('right_block').getWidth() + right + 19 ) + 'px;' );" i search to convert with .css( 'right:' + ( $('#right_block').width() + right + 19 ) + 'px;'
[13:35:34] <hlve> Anything else you see that's changed?
[13:35:51] <shoky> hlve: nothing in the console?
[13:36:31] <arielserafini> David_Bradbury, you could probably use a click event handler on the select itself, and use a variable to test if the select is open or closed
[13:36:40] <arielserafini> David_Bradbury, not sure how good that solution is though
[13:36:40] <hlve> no o_o
[13:36:51] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: legend
[13:37:06] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, ?
[13:37:23] <arielserafini> NoiseEee, yes, but since it's a jQuery object I don't think .files would return anything
[13:37:24] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: you're a legend. Thanks :)
[13:37:33] <shoky> hlve: what jq?
[13:37:49] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, oh, you got the parameters thing right?
[13:37:57] <hlve> 1.8.1
[13:38:02] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: pointing out the options
[13:38:10] <arielserafini> :)
[13:38:11] <hazamonzo__> I'll get to setting those properties soon enough
[13:38:15] <arielserafini> glad to help
[13:38:17] <hlve> should I go back to 1.8.0?
[13:38:20] <hazamonzo__> when i get this jsfiddle working the way i want
[13:38:24] <arielserafini> that should be documented somewhere though
[13:38:59] <shoky> hlve: i doubt that'd be it.. forward your ports and post a link ;>
[13:39:08] <hlve> can't
[13:39:09] <hlve> lol
[13:39:16] <shoky> prolly can if u wann ;P
[13:39:26] <shoky> unless uh
[13:39:27] <shoky> you cant
[13:39:29] <hlve> no, i don't have access to the router or anything.  lol
[13:39:33] <hlve> i'm at work ;p
[13:39:43] <hlve> if it were at home, sure. they have shit locked down here
[13:40:08] <hlve> sorry. they have stuff locked down here*
[13:40:09] <hlve> lol
[13:40:31] <shoky> well i cant debug smth i cant see ;p
[13:40:57] <hlve> blah :\
[13:41:04] <hlve> I can maybe do a join.me session or something
[13:41:09] <hlve> but you can't control from that
[13:41:11] <hlve> lol
[13:42:27] <shoky> maybe its some lame IE security setting about localhost or local LAN addresses, who knows :\
[13:42:40] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: of weird... not many options
[13:42:41] <ratiz> hi peoples :D
[13:42:53] <hazamonzo__> most options are define in the HTML and not the fucntion :s
[13:42:55] <hlve> hm
[13:43:26] <ratiz> wtf?
[13:43:29] <ratiz> mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
[13:43:41] <hlve> should I maybe wrap it in a .ready?
[13:43:41] <hlve> lol
[13:43:47] <hlve> that wouldn't make a difference
[13:43:52] <hlve> I'm desperate for this shit to work lol
[13:44:08] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, what do you mean?
[13:44:33] <shoky> hlve: i'd try putting some console.logs  in that xdr code, to see if its even being used
[13:44:37] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: I have a jsfiddle for you this time :) http://jsfiddle.net/vy2qZ/
[13:44:52] <hlve> how would I add an error handler do that
[13:44:58] <shoky> not an error handler
[13:45:00] <shoky> console.logs
[13:45:03] <hlve> ah
[13:45:22] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, okay, what are you trying to do now?
[13:45:24] <hazamonzo__> replace the HTML <select data-placeholder="Choose a Country" class="chzn-select"> with..... <select data-placeholder="Choose a Country" multiple class="chzn-select">
[13:45:43] <hlve> stupid question, how would I do that?
[13:45:55] <shoky> console.log('im here')
[13:46:06] <hlve> console.log(ajaxTransport); ?
[13:46:08] <hlve> ah
[13:46:10] <hlve> k
[13:46:15] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, you need to add "multiple" in there using javascript?
[13:46:24] <hlve>         if (window.XDomainRequest) {
[13:46:24] <hlve>             console.log('im here')
[13:46:25] <hlve> right?
[13:46:31] <hlve> ;
[13:46:42] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: well im not too fussed. But i was thinking that multiple would have been a fucntion property
[13:46:48] <shoky> well that's one place, but it'd be more interesting inside the callbacks there
[13:46:59] <hazamonzo__> liiike .chosen({type:"multiple"})
[13:47:15] <hlve> well. that one wrote to the log. I'll add it more places thruout
[13:47:32] <ayente> i go to work for my question i have aacount in forum thank
[13:47:41] <shoky> hlve: for example next to  : xdr = new XDomainRequest();
[13:47:43] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, http://jsfiddle.net/vy2qZ/1/
[13:48:01] <arielserafini> I agree it could be a property
[13:48:04] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: Ha!
[13:48:09] <hazamonzo__> Yeah that will work too :)
[13:48:32] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, maybe patch it and submit a pull request?
[13:48:36] <shoky> hlve: and make it try to send a request, of course
[13:48:36] <hazamonzo__> but remember. i don't have access to anything to do with .chosen()
[13:48:42] <arielserafini> ah
[13:48:48] <hazamonzo__> hmmm,
[13:49:01] <arielserafini> what CAN you do then?
[13:49:05] <arielserafini> can you pass parameters?
[13:49:07] <hazamonzo__> i think this is a chicken, egg situation
[13:49:13] <ayente> yes i'm dj it's my hobby (800â‚¬ for night] it's very diifcult to see girls :))
[13:49:47] <shoky> hmm
[13:50:19] <jedimind> ... what
[13:50:19] <b-ot> jedimind, is if not is?
[13:50:25] <hazamonzo__> right, i think im just going to fix the code in the application im using and submit a pull request. This is nuts! :D
[13:50:37] <hlve> so it's not getting to the xdr = new XDomainRequest();
[13:50:40] <hlve> didnt output the log
[13:50:45] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, :)
[13:50:50] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: also, i think i'll integrate http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/ ;)
[13:50:58] <shoky> hlve: and you entered a zip, ye?
[13:50:59] <hazamonzo__> Its based on chose
[13:51:03] <hazamonzo__> *chosen
[13:51:04] <hlve> ah i'm stupid
[13:51:05] <hlve> one sec.
[13:51:05] <hlve> lol
[13:51:44] <hlve> console.log('im here on the onload');
[13:51:44] <hlve> xdr.onload = function () {
[13:51:49] <hlve> that didn't log to console
[13:51:49] <Croves> Hey guys... how do I get the action of a form with jquery?
[13:51:52] <hlve> the other one did though
[13:52:12] <shoky> hlve: yea so it made it to the xdr.open
[13:52:22] <shoky> so.. no help there.
[13:52:45] <arielserafini> hazamonzo__, going home, be back in a bit
[13:52:47] <hlve> Stupid question, but the page I'm trying this on is HTTPS, and the ajax is for an HTTP
[13:52:50] <arielserafini> best of luck in your endeavors :)
[13:52:52] <hlve> would that cause this?
[13:53:05] <hazamonzo__> arielserafini: Tale it easy!
[13:53:08] <hazamonzo__> *take
[13:53:14] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[13:53:21] <Croves> hello
[13:53:26] <shoky> hlve: it's IE, such questions can't be stupid
[13:53:30] <hlve> lol
[13:53:36] <hlve> Lemme try fixing tha
[13:53:48] <hlve> Jesus christ
[13:53:57] <hlve> ... Really IE?
[13:54:03] <shoky> that was it?
[13:54:05] <hlve> Yes.
[13:54:06] <hlve> Oh my god
[13:54:07] <hlve> lol
[13:54:11] <AzizLight> I am using jquery ui dialog and the dialog buttons are not styled even though the dialog itself is. What am I doing wrong?
[13:54:20] <hlve> Well, thank you for the help with all of this haha. What a stupid fix.
[13:54:24] <shoky> hlve: and it works fine on the HTTPS with chrome/firefox?
[13:54:29] <hlve> Yes
[13:54:30] <shoky> np
[13:54:48] <hlve> Makes no sense whatsoever, but atleast it works :)
[13:54:49] <shoky> nice catch ;P
[13:55:21] <NoiseEee> hlve: it actually does make sense, its a same-origin policy issue :|
[13:55:26] <NoiseEee> hlve: but good to note for future, thx
[13:55:39] <hlve> Really appreciate you helping me thru this man, this has been a small project that I've been working on for awhile lol
[13:55:58] <hlve> Ahh. what a relief.
[13:55:59] <hlve> lol
[13:56:15] <shoky> ;]
[13:57:07] <shoky> NoiseEee: SOP was a given anyway because it's a different domain, but its CORS enabled
[13:58:59] <mikunos> hi guys, is there a way to load a json array data in the html form objects
[13:59:03] <mikunos> ?
[13:59:19] <shoky> yes. but. what?
[13:59:40] <mikunos> http://pastie.org/4722120
[13:59:50] <mikunos> I have a json data
[14:00:38] <shoky> you can loop over your array with $.each or $.map
[14:00:50] <mikunos> already done
[14:01:02] <mikunos> but I don't know how to set the values
[14:01:34] <shoky> .val(...) no good?
[14:01:49] <mikunos> also for the select object?
[14:01:58] <shoky> well yes
[14:02:02] <shoky> but that depends
[14:02:33] <shoky> you want to set the value of the selecT? or you want to set the actual options?
[14:02:36] <shoky> or what.
[14:02:45] <mikunos> the actual option
[14:03:04] <shoky> elaborate
[14:03:21] <shoky> i don't feel like mindreading
[14:04:22] <mikunos> ???
[14:04:24] <shoky> you can .append() new options..
[14:04:29] <shoky> you can .remove() existing ones
[14:04:43] <shoky> you can select existings ones and change their value with .val() and their text with .text()
[14:04:50] <shoky> you can do anything , just say what you wanna do.
[14:05:06] <mikunos> ok
[14:05:16] <mikunos> how have I select them by name?
[14:05:23] <mikunos> $('#name')
[14:05:28] <shoky> that's by id
[14:05:28] <mikunos> ?
[14:05:48] <mikunos> $('.name')
[14:05:53] <shoky> that's by class
[14:05:59] <mikunos> :|
[14:06:16] <mikunos> attr('name')
[14:06:31] <shoky> ok..
[14:06:40] <mikunos> ??
[14:07:05] <shoky> $('[name=bla]') will select elements with name attribute being bla
[14:07:28] <mikunos> thanks
[14:07:49] <mikunos> is there a way to know if it is a checkbox or select box
[14:07:58] <mikunos> before to set the value?
[14:07:59] <shoky> "it"?
[14:08:06] <mikunos> yes
[14:08:44] <shoky> $('select[name=bla]') will select a <select> ..
[14:09:19] <mikunos> but I don't know before if the json data will go in a select
[14:09:23] <mikunos> or in a textbox
[14:10:42] <shoky> http://docs.jquery.com
[14:10:50] <mikunos> thanks
[14:19:21] <barfoo365> I am getting an uncaught 'SyntaxError : Unexpected Identifier' error on line 14 of this http://pastebin.com/wv3M6gWV - Can anyone see why?
[14:19:54] <Eviltwin> barfoo365: Render this first
[14:20:01] <Eviltwin> Open it in your browser and use View Source
[14:20:03] <Eviltwin> Copy that
[14:20:16] <Eviltwin> Assume PHP is gibberish to us
[14:20:55] <barfoo365> sorry, you canb ignore the php bit!
[14:21:20] <NoiseEee> barfoo365: show the rendered source.
[14:21:31] <Eviltwin> The problem is that PHP bit is producing a result at runtime
[14:21:39] <Eviltwin> And because we don't have your runtime, we don't know what that bit is
[14:21:46] <Eviltwin> So show the rendered result, please
[14:23:12] <AzizLight> how do I get the previous sibling of $(this) (which is a form) in this code please? http://pastie.org/4722224
[14:23:21] <scar> is there a good plugin that does something similar to this? (small thumbnails to change the big image) http://www.cartersjewelchest.net/collections.php?collectionID=13
[14:24:07] <derekpioneer> AzizLight: $(this).prev()
[14:26:35] <AzizLight> derekpioneer: I tried that here: http://pastie.org/4722248 but the form doesn't submit when I click the "Yes!" button...
[14:27:33] <barfoo365> Eviltwin, NoiseEee : Here is the rendered source http://pastebin.com/gc8nRuZL
[14:28:16] <Eviltwin> barfoo365: ...why are there <?php and <?= tags in there?
[14:29:43] <NoiseEee> that is not rendered source.
[14:29:52] <NoiseEee> barfoo365: view in browser. view/copy source.  paste THAT.
[14:30:14] <Eviltwin> And if that's what you got from viewing the source, you need to reconfigure your server
[14:30:55] <barfoo365> NoiseEEe : that iswhat i have done?
[14:31:08] <NoiseEee> barfoo365: if you have, then read Eviltwin's comment post haste
[14:31:13] <NoiseEee> your php is not being parsed.
[14:31:34] <Eviltwin> barfoo365: When you open the page, do you see "echo 'Basic Validation';" in the browser window?
[14:31:38] <Eviltwin> And other code
[14:31:39] <AzizLight> can anyone tell me why this code doesn't submit my form please? http://pastie.org/4722248
[14:32:00] <barfoo365> I see "; } else { echo 'SECOND VALIDATION';
[14:32:26] <Eviltwin> You should talk to ##php about how to configure your server
[14:32:35] <Eviltwin> Because your server-side code is not running how it should be
[14:32:57] <Eviltwin> AzizLight: Because of this: $('form.button-to-delete').submit(function() { ... return false; }
[14:33:00] <Eviltwin> )
[14:33:28] <hazamonzo__> hey folks. selector advice. I have a div (circled) that i know the name of. the child div (arrow) is dynamic. so i can't select this easily. I need to set this divs width attribute (underlined). http://wstaw.org/m/2012/09/14/plasma-desktopMy3980.jpg thoughts?
[14:33:54] <Eviltwin> AzizLight: Try something like this: http://pastie.org/4722295
[14:34:09] <hazamonzo__> i will need something like.... $('#R2')<something>.attr()
[14:34:47] <Eviltwin> $("#R2 .chzn-container").css("width", '250px'); ?
[14:34:57] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps $("#R2 > .chzn-container").css("width", '250px'); ?
[14:35:12] <hazamonzo__> Eviltwin: It looks good. Will give it a test :)
[14:35:22] <Eviltwin> hazamonzo__: Read this for more information: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[14:35:29] <Eviltwin> If you want to understand why I wrote what I wrote
[14:35:46] <hazamonzo__> Eviltwin: Sure. I've looked at selectors before. You can do some funky stuff! :D
[14:36:14] <AzizLight> Eviltwin: nope, doesn't work... When I click the "Yes!" button nothing happens..
[14:37:29] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ AzizLight
[14:37:31] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ AzizLight
[14:37:40] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[14:37:46] <Eviltwin> Go to jsfiddle.net
[14:37:52] <Eviltwin> Make a working demo there
[14:38:00] <Eviltwin> Save it, send me the link
[14:38:09] <Eviltwin> By working, I mean there's a dialog that actually opens with actual buttons
[14:38:32] <AzizLight> Eviltwin: ok I will do that, give me a second
[14:41:50] <dogarrhea2> is there a browser session timeout other than the one that destroys cookies upon browser close?
[14:42:17] <AzizLight> Eviltwin: that's my code, but I don't know why it doesn't work in codepen.. http://codepen.io/pen/
[14:43:12] <AzizLight> oops
[14:43:24] <AzizLight> Eviltwin: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/iIJfa
[14:44:02] <Eviltwin> Did you include jQuery and jQuery UI?
[14:45:12] <AzizLight> Eviltwin: not in codepen -_- http://codepen.io/anon/pen/iIJfa check again please - sorry for the hassle
[14:46:38] <Eviltwin> I'm still getting "'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$(document)')" which means jQuery isn
[14:46:41] <Eviltwin> 't there
[14:47:25] <clayjar> Please help. Why won't $("#priv_reg_uri").empty(); be effective?  http://pastebin.com/KNG1AJSX
[14:47:57] <AzizLight> Eviltwin: try this link, it works on mac... http://codepen.io/anon/pen/avBCE
[14:48:09] <clayjar> When I put in a console.log before that line, it correctly gets there, but .empty() just won't do it for some reason.
[14:50:54] <clayjar> (some helpful context: I have two text input fields, one w/ ID of regkey and another with priv_reg_url, and whatever is typed on regkey gets concatenated to priv_reg_url, and if regkey is empty (user presses backspace) then priv_reg_url should be ".empty()"'d or removed ...

[14:56:11] <BipolarCoder> something to read on a lazy Friday afternoon: http://www.scribd.com/doc/105844487/Bipolarcoder-Software-in-the-Key-of-Web
[15:20:03] <dogarrhea2> what is the possibility of a race condition on cookies and expiration
[15:20:23] <dogarrhea2> say i access a cookie just as it expires.
[15:27:34] <AzizLight> can anyone help me with this SO question please? It's a jquery ui dialog problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12432606/jquery-ui-dialog-using-a-form/
[15:37:38] <razzi> AzizLight, just try  $('form.button-to-delete').submit .. instead of  $(this).prev('form.button-to-delete').submit
[15:38:22] <AzizLight> razzi: I tried this, didn't work, but I managed to fix the error. I will submit a response to the SO question right now
[15:43:20] <Jax> hello
[15:43:29] <Jax> how can i get the table from a th element?
[15:44:41] <Jax> if $(this) is the <th>.. and the structure is like: <table><thead><tr><th>..
[15:46:51] <razzi> jax, $(this).parents('table')
[15:47:26] <Guim> Can I ask a question related to a jquery plugin here? I'd like some quick feedback on the masonry plugins, I'm not able to center the main container following the instructions of the plugins, here's my problem http://vultur.ca/masonry/ (inline styling and scripts are there on purpose of making it easier to see)
[15:49:12] <Jax> awesome, thx
[15:49:16] <Jax> gnite all
[16:02:28] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to search the debug output of the network monitor in firebug?
[16:02:52] <dogarrhea2> i search for something that obviously exists in http post/get headers like "ERROR" because i can see that in a specific request. but the search says "not found"
[16:03:43] <LordVorp> Guim: the style definition for class="centered" doesn't actually center anything.  Nor is it particularly related to jQuery, in that sense.
[16:04:35] <LordVorp> dogarrhea2: are there any  FB extensions like logging to a file? that might get you closer...
[16:04:37] <Guim> LordVorp the class centered is how I applied styling to my container
[16:05:17] <LordVorp> I see that.  But that style ONLY says, margin: 0 auto;  There's no centering in that.
[16:06:40] <Guim> LordVorp ?
[16:07:02] <Guim> LordVorp no offense but are you sure you know what you are talking about?
[16:07:58] <LordVorp> nope. I've just loaded the masonry page to see whether or not I've made myself look silly or not
[16:08:01] <LordVorp> I think I have
[16:08:46] <Guim> lol
[16:08:49] <Guim> no worries
[16:09:46] <Guim> by default for margin: 0 auto; to work you need to apply a witdth
[16:09:56] <Guim> but seems like Masonry does it by default
[16:10:04] <Guim> something is wrong in my code and I'm not sure what
[16:10:24] <Guim> at the beginning my link for my jquery was incorrect, fixed it and still no working masonry :S
[16:11:51] <LordVorp> well okay but, all I'm saying is that there's no CSS or code or style that will make the LABEL "centered" cause the EFFECT of centering, that I can see so far... and i'm loking at the masonry docs now.
[16:12:08] <LordVorp> but I'll keep looking... never herad of masonry before it looks awesome if it can be made to work. :)
[16:13:46] <Guim> LordVorp my inline styling has the class .centered with the right properties and then my container has the class centered, as far as masonry docs goes, it should workâ€¦ oh well, will try again
[16:14:49] <LordVorp> i'm looking, i'm looking: it DOES look "correct" but I'm wondering, if it might work better/differeng if instead of setting height/width on your divs, you put some sample "foobarbaz" content in them instead.
[16:15:47] <Guim> maybe
[16:15:53] <Guim> I,ll try that right away
[16:19:42] <jarr0dsz> hey guys im loading the contents of a page, save it to $page then replace the body tagg of html to replace everything
[16:20:57] <jarr0dsz> but it throws some errors i need to replace the whole page is there a way to do that?
[16:21:14] <jarr0dsz> not   $("body").empty().append $page
[16:21:30] <jarr0dsz> but everything from the <html> tag starting
[16:21:31] <LordVorp> jarr0dsz: the correct way to finish that statement is to state the content of the errors
[16:21:58] <jarr0dsz> bascially im trying to replace a portion of a page eventually but for now the whole page
[16:22:33] <LordVorp> document.href= newURL; ?
[16:22:37] <jarr0dsz> im not sure on the performance impact, saving the contents of a page to $page or just a portion
[16:22:38] <LordVorp> cuz that's the whole page. :)
[16:22:41] <jarr0dsz> guess the later is much faster?
[16:23:02] <LordVorp> at that pace, unless the $page is monstrous, the main performance issue is network speed.
[16:23:07] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: yes ive used chaning the url before but i want to replace the html contents of it instead since reloading a page gives lagg
[16:23:12] <jarr0dsz> like css + js that has to be loaded in everytime
[16:24:43] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: im getting a NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS: Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentFragment.appendChild]
[16:24:57] <jarr0dsz> i shall post a pastie im not a guru in jquery
[16:25:18] <LordVorp> jarr0dsz: it sounds like you actually want to replace the <body> tag.  In which case: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2825586/inplace-replace-entire-html-document
[16:25:49] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: im doing it like this http://pastie.org/4722739
[16:26:06] <jarr0dsz> its a bit more complex but to keep simple this is what happens and throws that eror
[16:26:11] <LordVorp> and if there is js + css in the <head>, it will keep that loaded while replacing the uh, "main" content
[16:27:28] <jarr0dsz> ok thx i have to read that interesting
[16:27:58] <LordVorp> why not $("body").html($page); ?   ? :)
[16:29:26] <LordVorp> or even $("body").replaceWith($page);
[16:29:52] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: I try that yes , the problem that i want to fix here is not reloading the css + js everytime on a reload
[16:29:56] <LordVorp> but I think the first will be better.
[16:29:57] <jarr0dsz> im basically now redirecting the page with websockets
[16:30:13] <jarr0dsz> so im sending a url like game/step/1
[16:30:21] <jarr0dsz> then /game/step/2 and it reloads the page everytime
[16:30:29] <LordVorp> heh alright. But i'm saying that, presuming the css + js is in the head, then replacing $("body") *should* keep that stuff loaded
[16:30:47] <LordVorp> however it's possible there will be work on the browser's part to then APPLY that css to the newly parsed <body>
[16:30:48] <jarr0dsz> but then the content im replacing body with
[16:31:00] <jarr0dsz> $page should only contain the content not the header again right
[16:31:11] <LordVorp> right
[16:31:12] <jarr0dsz> im now loading a whole page + header css etc in that #page
[16:31:17] <jarr0dsz> so i have to fix that in my rails app
[16:31:33] <jarr0dsz> to remove the header from it so $page would only have the contents of the page
[16:31:47] <LordVorp> yes, if the whole point is to avoid re-loading the <head> section, then make sure your replacement content doesn't have a <head> s!
[16:31:50] <LordVorp> :)
[16:32:07] <jarr0dsz> damn still keep getting those S_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS: Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentFragment.appendChild] errors though :(
[16:32:22] <LordVorp> I'm not sure (you'll have to experiment) if your returned content should be wrapped in <body></body>
[16:32:24] <jarr0dsz> could that be caused cause $page holds everything?
[16:32:56] <jarr0dsz> if i do like $("body").html('sadfas'); it goes fine
[16:33:39] <LordVorp> absolutely...  including (it sounds like) the javascript libs that you're dealing with already... yes make the app return JUST the content (not the headers) and it should presumably stop having to (recursively) re-parse itself (recursively)  ;-)
[16:34:03] <someprimetime> how can i target only anchors within a specific class?
[16:34:11] <someprimetime> is it $('.selector > a')?
[16:34:38] <rmurphey> someprimetime: just like you would in css
[16:34:55] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: sound like logic thx alot ! im going to expiriment with it a bit
[16:35:00] <rmurphey> that selector will give you immediate child a's within .selector elements
[16:35:02] <jarr0dsz> would this also work in internet exploder?
[16:35:10] <rmurphey> if you want all descendants, you'd get rid of the >
[16:35:17] <jarr0dsz> like replacing page contents, ie always have those strange issues with these non default stuff
[16:35:55] <someprimetime> rmurphey: thanks
[16:35:58] <LordVorp> jarr0dsz: one of the reasons I use jQuery is that it makes the same code work in jIE and Chrome and Firefox.  so presumably yes.  But in this case: try it!
[16:36:54] <jarr0dsz> great thx i try it out ;)
[16:37:03] <jarr0dsz> actually quit fun if it works ;p
[16:39:19] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: would you know perhaps if i can alert the $page contents? it says its an object
[16:39:30] <dogarrhea2> how do you determine what event fires when you click a particular element?
[16:39:37] <dogarrhea2> i don't know anything about this particular element
[16:39:38] <jarr0dsz> so alert(@page); only shows an alert with object how to display its contents?
[16:40:07] <LordVorp> use firebug, and console.log
[16:40:11] <jarr0dsz> dogarrhea2: ill guess you first have to id an element to be able to trigger action on it
[16:45:18] <LordVorp> jarr0dsz: if it's still not working, after you have removed the header content, this looks like it might work even better: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236360/how-do-i-replace-the-entire-html-node-using-jquery
[16:45:42] <jarr0dsz> yeah have to think about removing the header
[16:45:51] <jarr0dsz> its just really wierd what happens in my browser now ;p
[16:47:50] <LordVorp> oh i'm sure. :)
[16:48:28] <jarr0dsz> hmmz do you know how to alert the contents of $page perhaps?
[16:48:35] <jarr0dsz> i try to figure out whats in it
[16:48:57] <jarr0dsz> the headers should not be in there but cannot be sure unless i can somehow print the contents of it to screen but to no avail :(
[16:49:23] <LordVorp> I'm telling you, if you want to dump [Object] then you need to use Firebug in FireFox, and use console.log to see what the [Object] contains.
[16:49:31] <LordVorp> other than that you'll have to use a DOM browser
[16:49:47] <jarr0dsz> dom browser and look for the contents of $page
[16:49:48] <LordVorp> I've never found another way to see it, so far.
[16:50:08] <LordVorp> and yes, look for $page (probably at the top level) and see what's in it.
[16:51:57] <jarr0dsz> okay ive did a search shame it seems to be not there in the top nodes nor in underlaying ones :(
[16:52:25] <LordVorp> then is there a reason not to use Firebug?
[16:52:49] <LordVorp> and console.log, to see it?
[16:52:52] <jarr0dsz> im using firebug yes under dom
[16:53:19] <LordVorp> alright but I'm saying: in the javascript, load $page, then add the line: console.log($page);
[16:53:27] <LordVorp> then it should dump the object into the console
[16:53:30] <LordVorp> and you can see what's in it
[16:53:35] <jarr0dsz> ok sorry missed that lets try that
[16:53:45] <LordVorp> :)
[16:54:08] <shoky> goddamnit
[16:55:24] <shoky> didnt think it'd ever happen to me but it just did. the ol'  return \n returnVal;  where _ is an actual newline in the code
[16:55:37] <dns-away> hello
[16:55:43] <dns-away> can you elp me .-)
[16:55:53] <shoky> \n not _   :\
[16:55:59] <dns-away> w./
[16:56:04] <shoky> maybe
[16:56:09] <dns-away> o.p.)
[16:56:12] <dns-away> Ok
[16:56:35] <jarr0dsz> ok so it returns the params not the content as it seems strange
[16:56:50] <shoky> ok
[16:56:58] <jarr0dsz> i do have some get requests wich loads the /game/step/1 part i assume thats whats stored in @page then
[16:57:02] <jarr0dsz> they include the headers also
[16:57:06] <jarr0dsz> see if can shave them off
[16:57:30] <LordVorp> well if your pastie was the actual code you're running, it didn't look like it would compile, did you paste a pseudo-code version, or did I just misunderstand it? :)
[16:57:48] <dns-away> i have html.span#price = '' and i want on click input this.attr('class') + span#price.text(), but no calculating 0k.
[16:57:53] <dns-away> Ill show code if you want.
[16:57:56] <dns-away> :-)
[16:58:42] <shoky> you want what?
[16:58:56] <dns-away> calculating price <if checkbox checked>
[16:58:57] <jarr0dsz> LordVorp: it was only part its more complex on several layers ans using websockets an coffeescript
[16:59:09] <shoky> dns-away: what does .attr('class') have to do with it?
[16:59:24] <dns-away> number ' it;s price
[16:59:29] <dns-away> numbers~*
[16:59:35] <shoky> the class is the price?
[16:59:39] <dns-away> yes
[16:59:41] <shoky> :\
[16:59:51] <shoky> try parseInt
[17:00:03] <shoky> or parseFloat
[17:00:26] <dogarrhea2> i want to cry

[17:00:42] <dns-away> :-)tu
[17:00:50] <dogarrhea2> the event listener attached to the thing i new nothing about is some URL encoded function that doesn't url decode
[17:00:58] <dogarrhea2> knew*
[17:01:33] <shoky> no idea what that means but yep, it sounds worth crying about

[17:21:29] <shoky> php doesn't run on the browser
[17:21:42] <shoky> so it probably doesn't involve any
[17:22:14] <MattBrotz> No my code does, it generates the divs
[17:22:45] <shoky> sure, your parents are involved too if you wanna go back that far
[17:23:34] <ProLoser|Work> is there a way to get an object of elm attributes?

[18:11:20] <murph> I've got a UI slider with two handles. It returns their current state with 'ui.values' in an event. What's the best way to sort the values? (I'm kinda new to jquery)
[18:21:17] <zzing> So there is a function for executing a get JSON: http://docs.jquery.com/GetJSON   it has a callback function as a parameter, but what is the specification of this function? The example has 'data, textSuccess' as parameters, but it doesn't say what it actually will take or what it will take.
[18:21:59] <k1t> hey folks
[18:23:34] <k1t> trying to think of an approach to "automate" droppable() (i believe) from UI. the goal is allow a user to click a button which will in turn create an element, which i would like the cursor to be able to drag around
[18:24:06] <k1t> not sure if im making much sense hehe would be happy to clarify if necessary
[18:25:09] <k1t> i'd like this element to be "pre-selected" for draggable()/droppable() though, so when its created, all the user needs to do is move their mouse and, once they click, it would release that element
[18:25:38] <k1t> and itd no longer be draggable or w/e by the mouse
[18:25:42] <k1t> not completely sure which to use.
[19:35:04] <Samian> hello
[19:36:01] <timwis> Hey guys, does anyone recommend a basic jQuery plugin for table sorting that allows you to write your own ajax data fetch logic?
[19:40:40] <Lucky--> timwis: check out jqgrid
[19:40:45] <Lucky--> or datatables
[19:41:00] <Lucky--> *jquery datatables
[19:42:13] <timwis> Lucky-- Yeah I've been trying datatables, and they provide a lot of flexibility, but trying to override their ajax logic is crazy! The data they attempt to send to your server page is an array of objects
[19:42:33] <timwis> I'll check out jqgrid - I wrote it off before because I didn't think I could customize styling (going for bootstrap style)
[19:42:55] <Lucky--> timwis: just render to a standard table and then call dataTables on it AFTER
[19:42:56] <Lucky--> ;-)
[19:43:12] <Lucky--> jquery template it as a table
[19:43:21] <timwis> Lucky-- for datatables?
[19:43:43] <Lucky--> yea
[19:43:56] <timwis> Lucky-- That's what I was doing, but I want to render, say, 15 results, then when you click the 'next' button on datatables, have it fetch the next 30 results. *thats* the difficult part
[19:43:58] <Lucky--> http://datatables.net/
[19:44:10] <Lucky--> oh paging
[19:44:12] <timwis> Lucky-- http://datatables.net/ref#fnServerData
[19:44:15] <timwis> even sorting
[19:44:25] <Lucky--> does the server side provide any sort of filtering mechanism? is it odata?
[19:44:35] <timwis> basically,w hen you interact it tries to send a call to your server script. i want to modify how that call works to use specific params
[19:44:38] <Lucky--> what is the source of the data?
[19:44:48] <timwis> cloudmine.me , similar to iriscouch
[19:45:46] <Lucky--> timwis: https://cloudmine.me/docs/api#ref_sort
[19:45:46] <Lucky--> :-)
[19:46:16] <Lucky--> let me know when you go "damn it, why didnt i rtfm earlier? " :-)
[19:46:18] <timwis> Lucky-- I know how to get cloudmine to sort. What I can't do is make datatables do that in it's cloudmine query
[19:46:26] <Lucky--> limit
[19:46:56] <timwis> heh, I've actually read up quite a bit on cloudmine's docs and datatables docs, over the course of 4 days
[19:47:01] <Lucky--> http://datatables.net/plug-ins/pagination
[19:47:16] <Lucky--> combine that with cloudmines pagination
[19:47:19] <Lucky--> and you are set
[19:47:30] <timwis> no, I guess I didn't explain my issue well enough
[19:48:16] <timwis> When I click something on a datatables table, whether it's sort, next page, search, limit...datatables attempts to query the URL I specified to get the data based on the new filter i just clicked
[19:48:26] <timwis> But the way it attempts to query the URL I specify is *crazy*
[19:48:44] <timwis> it sends this bizarre array of objects
[19:49:03] <Lucky--> does it have ?callBack on it somewehre
[19:49:05] <Lucky--> if so thats jsonp
[19:49:17] <timwis> no
[19:49:51] <timwis> I'll check out jqGrid though. If I can remove/customize styling, that will be great
[19:49:55] <timwis> thanks
[19:50:16] <Lucky--> i didnt care to double up writing my grid code, so i just used a hybrid server side/client side solution
[19:50:19] <Lucky--> actually used jqgrid
[19:59:59] <ericw> http://pastebin.com/C1zEyLGp
[20:00:05] <ericw> Can someone help me figure out what's wrong with that?

[20:02:53] <ericw> do I need to specify my background for the div id by adding div id="body_wrap_1" style="background: url()" ??
[20:03:04] <ericw> because currently the background is specified in the stylesheet
[20:03:52] <timwis> Lucky-- I don't see a way to customize the ajax logic in jqGrid. Am I that blind?
[20:05:10] <iceworm> anyone know how to know what key is pressed on the keypress event?
[20:05:18] <iceworm> (i need to know when enter is pressed)
[20:06:14] <johnkpaul> event.keyCode==13
[20:06:17] <johnkpaul> ^@ic
[20:06:19] <johnkpaul> iceworm:
[20:07:44] <iceworm> yes.. or.. finally found on google, too.. event.which is supposedly the cross browser way
[20:08:23] <timwis> Hey guys, does anyone recommend a basic jQuery plugin for table sorting that allows you to write your own ajax data fetch logic?
[20:08:55] <ericw> someone feel like helping me with this? http://pastebin.com/C1zEyLGp it's a pretty small piece of code but not functioning
[20:09:13] <ericw> it should read the url of the page you're on and change the background if you're at the index
[20:09:33] <paulmillar> why would you do that with jquery ericw?
[20:09:44] <ericw> because it's necessary for some pages
[20:10:01] <paulmillar> can you not just apply a class to the html body?
[20:10:08] <ericw> no
[20:10:26] <ericw> the header is not static across all pages, but the html is identical across all pages
[20:10:28] <ericw> it's a typepad blog
[20:10:43] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com/cloud/ click the "Previous" link at the bottom of the page near the footer
[20:10:54] <ericw> compare the source code of "Previous" to the source code of the index
[20:10:57] <ericw> it's exactly the same
[20:13:18] <ericw> howcome i always get "WHY ARE YOU DOING IT THIS WAY" and then when i explain no one helps?
[20:14:23] <ericw> paulmillar: i answered your question, you answer mine now. ;)
[20:14:35] <ericw> the first question
[20:14:36] <ericw> http://pastebin.com/C1zEyLGp
[20:14:39] <ericw> not the howcome question
[20:18:24] <paulmillar> I don't know jquery / js :)
[20:18:25] <paulmillar>  
[20:19:32] <ericw> i hate when people hire me to do something that isn't on my resume. lol
[20:20:31] <rsumi_> if i have, var x = $('<div><a class="test"/></div>') â€¦ how can i select the <a> tag by the class name?
[20:21:09] * ericw crickets
[20:22:48] <tw2113> $('a.test')
[20:23:20] <rsumi_> tw2113: how do i do that when the dom nodes are in the var x?
[20:23:37] <tw2113> why are you assigning to a variable
[20:24:02] <tw2113> var x = $('a.test')
[20:24:25] <rsumi_> tw2113: because the html string was provided by a template, not by the document
[20:24:58] <rsumi_> so i used jquery to create a dom tree of it and i want to modify the template before injecting it into the document
[20:29:04] <rsumi_> is it not possible with query yet?
[20:30:20] <tw2113> i'm not sure personally
[20:30:28] <tw2113> it's an odd thing to select by imho
[20:30:38] <ericw> http://pastebin.com/C1zEyLGp
[20:31:17] <rsumi_> i thought it was common for templating
[20:31:18] <rsumi_> hmmm
[20:31:31] <tw2113> *shrug* may be out of my range of knowhow
[20:32:24] <ajpiano> rsumi_: x.find(".y")
[20:32:25] <ajpiano> etc
[20:33:16] <rsumi_> yay!
[20:33:19] <rsumi_> thanks!
[20:34:35] <ericw> Anyone have a moment to assist?
[20:34:51] <ericw> <script language="javascript">
[20:34:52] <ericw> if (window.location.href.indexOf('/cloud/') != -1) {
[20:34:52] <ericw>     //Change background
[20:34:52] <ericw>     $('#body_wrap_1').css('backgroundImage','url(/images/headerbg2.jpg)');
[20:34:52] <ericw> }
[20:34:52] <ericw> </script>
[20:35:21] <ericw> small piece of code
[20:35:25] <ericw> it just doesn't work
[20:36:01] <rsumi_> i think backgroundImage is wrong
[20:37:39] <rookie84> hi there.
[20:37:54] <tw2113> .css("background-image", "url(/myimage.jpg)");
[20:38:41] <tw2113> 2 possible options
[20:38:42] <tw2113>     $('selector').css('backgroundImage','url(images/example.jpg)');
[20:38:42] <tw2113>     $('selector').css({'background-image':'url(images/example.jpg)'});
[20:39:18] <tw2113> i'd go the easy route and just toggle classes and have the bg setting in the css itself
[20:40:00] <rookie84> when I loop through some divs, and try to show them, why does it show them all at once, even I have a delay(2000) there?
[20:40:06] <rookie84> $('#'+element.id).delay(2000).show('slow');
[20:40:12] <rookie84> but stilll it would show it all at once
[20:40:22] <rookie84> why doesn't the loop wait for the delay?
[20:41:37] <rookie84> http://pastie.org/4723574
[20:41:40] <rookie84> anyone please?
[20:43:54] <ericw> tw2113: still doesn't work
[20:44:01] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com/cloud/ :(
[20:44:22] <ericw> when you click a blog, it should display a shortened version of the header bg
[20:45:12] <ericw> or vice versa because i can't read/write jquery or js
[20:45:18] <ericw> but it's not actually doing anything
[20:47:24] <tw2113> eh?
[20:47:56] <tw2113> not sure what i'm supposed to be clicking
[20:48:16] <tw2113> what is "body_wrap_1"
[20:48:20] <tw2113> ID? class?
[20:49:12] <tw2113> something tells me you'll need to pass in the whole image path as well
[20:49:38] <tw2113> which is why it'd be even better to toggle classes on it instead of trying to change the bg yourself
[20:49:42] <ericw> it's not a click
[20:49:46] <ericw> it's on page url
[20:50:12] <ericw> i'll try the whole image url
[20:50:13] <tw2113> you still have a bad selector in $('body_wrap_1')
[20:50:21] <ericw> require the #?
[20:50:32] <tw2113> if body_wrap_1 is an ID, yes
[20:50:34] <ericw> it's the name of my div id containing the background image
[20:52:16] <Samian> can learning jquery possibly land me an internship with google ?
[20:53:45] <jrockjiggz> Samian: yes
[20:53:53] <ericw> tw2113: still no go
[20:53:57] <ericw> <script language="javascript">
[20:53:57] <ericw> if (window.location.href.indexOf('/cloud/') != -1) {
[20:53:57] <ericw>     //Change background

[20:53:57] <ericw> }
[20:53:58] <ericw> </script>
[20:54:20] <jrockjiggz> ).css({ backgroundImage:
[20:55:43] <Samian> well if only I knew where to look. Google doesnt have any internship positions available on their careers /job search website
[20:55:50] <ericw> jrockjiggz: still nothing
[20:56:13] <jrockjiggz> ericw: is url valid? is #body_wrap_1 valid?
[20:56:24] <ericw> #body_wrap_1 is definitely valid
[20:56:31] <jrockjiggz> console.log( $('#body_wrap_1').length ); //should produce > 0
[20:56:34] <ericw> i couldn't be for sure if /cloud/ is an acceptable URL for this
[20:56:48] <jrockjiggz> cloud?
[20:57:08] <ericw> cloud is the index directory
[20:57:09] <Lucky--> quick reference an anonymous function wrapped in a $() set is just an alias for document.ready right?
[20:57:35] <jrockjiggz> ericw: your css looks valid
[20:57:39] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com/cloud/
[20:57:41] <jrockjiggz> *jquery
[20:59:04] <jrockjiggz> ericw: the code works
[20:59:05] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/kDNYa/
[20:59:31] <jrockjiggz> Lucky--: yep
[20:59:43] <jrockjiggz> Lucky--: $( function() {});
[20:59:58] <ericw> jrockjiggz: so it's my URL it's not accepting?
[21:00:23] <tw2113> i got it to work in firefox scratchpad
[21:00:52] <jrockjiggz> ericw: ? your url is ok.. you may not be executing the line.
[21:01:27] <ericw> maybe that's the issue
[21:01:30] <ericw> the line should execute itself
[21:02:13] <jrockjiggz> add console.log('test'); after, see if it works
[21:03:08] <tw2113> console.log( window.location.href.indexOf('/cloud/') != -1 );
[21:03:09] <tw2113> returns true
[21:05:12] <ericw> jrockjiggz: it's now in the code
[21:05:17] <jrockjiggz> ?
[21:05:40] <Lucky--> jrockjiggz: thx. i switch between diff languages so much at times its easy to forget the symantics of each
[21:07:30] <paulmillar> Anyone able to help me out with a jQuery problem which should be relatively simple? $20 paypal for a solution? :)
[21:07:43] <tw2113> Samian, http://www.google.com/about/jobs/

[21:09:17] <ericw> same results.. nothing happened
[21:10:12] <ericw> i hate some people
[21:10:37] <tw2113> why are you doing it that way?
[21:10:49] <tw2113> no idea why you added the console.log there
[21:10:55] <ericw> this girl i haven't seen in like 3+weeks but she won't quit blowing me up with message "COME OUT WITH ME NOW!"
[21:11:06] <ericw> i'm doing anything right now
[21:11:08] <tw2113> tell her you have herpes from her mom
[21:11:33] <ericw> i told her no, she said "i expected that" and i just replied "you should bitch"
[21:11:56] <ericw> i've had 3 hours of sleep in 2 days and this project needs to be completed by monday :(
[21:12:10] <ericw> i will paypal someone $20 to get this fixed. lol
[21:12:15] <ericw> but you can't have passwords unfortunately
[21:12:25] <Lucky--> ericw: huh money? sup?
[21:12:27] <Lucky--> what ya need?
[21:12:33] <ericw> lol
[21:12:41] <ericw> i need backgrounds to change
[21:12:47] <ericw> the index needs a specific longer background
[21:12:51] <Lucky--> ericw: ok give me a jsfiddle
[21:13:00] <ericw> the rest of the layout needs a shortened background
[21:13:23] <ericw> Lucky--: I can give you the url to the website?
[21:13:28] <Lucky--> mk
[21:13:35] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com/cloud/
[21:14:09] <Lucky--> look what i just found on my vs2012 menu: https://dl.dropbox.com/0/view/qkeiqy1o5yymlgy/Apps/CloudShot/shot_9142012_91342_pm.jpeg interested.
[21:14:12] <Lucky--> *interesting
[21:14:35] <Lucky--> ok so you want to change background of?
[21:14:40] <ericw> the header
[21:14:46] <Lucky--> k via js?
[21:14:56] <ericw> ideally yes
[21:14:58] <tw2113> if (window.location.href.indexOf('/cloud/') != -1) {
[21:14:58] <tw2113>     //Change background
[21:14:58] <tw2113>     $('#body_wrap_1').addClass('bg2');
[21:14:58] <tw2113> }
[21:15:04] <tw2113> <style>
[21:15:04] <tw2113> .bg2 {
[21:15:04] <tw2113>     background-image: url('http://blogs.salesforce.com/images/headerbg2.jpg');
[21:15:04] <tw2113> }
[21:15:05] <tw2113> </style>
[21:15:22] <ericw> because the same source code is found in more than just the index page
[21:15:30] <shoky> you've got tons of JS errors
[21:15:47] <ericw> yeah there's half-assed code all over the place until i clean it up
[21:15:49] <tw2113> the class should only be added when /cloud/ returns true
[21:15:50] <shoky> that 'if' isn't being run
[21:16:10] <Lucky--> ericw: you work for salesforce?
[21:16:19] <ericw> Lucky--: maybe
[21:16:22] <Lucky--> cool
[21:16:25] <ericw> lol
[21:16:33] <ericw> i work for a lot of companies but typically i avoid cloud based development
[21:16:41] <Lucky--> i only do cloud based dev
[21:16:48] <Lucky--> just not with shit languages like php
[21:16:50] <ericw> i'm not that good of a developer.
[21:16:54] <ericw> ;)
[21:17:02] <Lucky--> im not a developer. i just code to bring my business needs into reality
[21:17:10] <ericw> yeah that's how i started also
[21:17:20] <ericw> i have a nice looking resume because i've worked with a lot of big name companies
[21:17:21] <ericw> lol
[21:17:28] <shoky> ericw: your code is:   if console.log( window.location.href.indexOf('/cloud/') != -1 ); {
[21:17:34] <ericw> oh yeah
[21:17:37] <shoky> that is totally wrong
[21:17:38] <ericw> let me remove the console.log
[21:17:39] <ericw> haha
[21:18:06] * tw2113 is indirectly responsible for that
[21:18:25] <shoky> you didnt tell him to if console ;)
[21:18:58] <tw2113> but i did paste console.log( window.location.href.indexOf('/cloud/') != -1 );
[21:19:14] <Lucky--> eric do me a favor, what css class is http://blogs.salesforce.com/images/headerbg.jpg set in
[21:19:18] <shoky> yup
[21:19:34] <ericw> #body_wrap_1
[21:19:36] <ericw> it's an id not a class
[21:19:41] <Lucky--> ps: install progressive internet explorer
[21:19:45] <Lucky--> thats what the PIE error is
[21:19:49] <Lucky--> it needs an addon
[21:19:57] <Lucky--> a .htc file
[21:20:24] <rookie84> any idea why this shows all the boxes at once? : http://jsfiddle.net/cgyXj/
[21:20:25] <ericw> hm, there is an .htc file included in these scripts
[21:20:32] <rookie84> it is supposed to show one box and then go to another?
[21:20:34] <rookie84> please help.
[21:20:35] <ericw> i didn't actually develop this template, they commissioned me to redesign it
[21:21:20] <rookie84> why does all the boxes are shown at once, when we do a loop or setInterval?
[21:21:27] <Lucky--> it looks like one problem you are having is that all of your scripts aren't running
[21:21:30] <Lucky--> because the js is mossed
[21:21:31] <Lucky--> *messed
[21:21:49] <Lucky--> var a = $("#body_wrap_1");
[21:21:52] <Lucky--> err
[21:21:55] <Lucky--> https://dl.dropbox.com/0/view/2nfk61gv439cwk7/Apps/CloudShot/shot_9142012_92139_pm.jpeg
[21:21:56] <ericw> well my js just above this script runs
[21:21:59] <rookie84> like there are three div boxes b1, b2, b3 and if I loop through them, they are shown all at once instead of each ?
[21:22:00] <ericw> hence the "More" button
[21:22:06] <ericw> click "More" and my js there works
[21:22:20] <Lucky--> when js breaks it can half execute your code and half not
[21:22:32] <Lucky--> ive seen it experienced it numerous times
[21:22:35] <Lucky--> and spent hours debugging
[21:22:44] <Lucky--> *seen it/experienced
[21:24:17] <rookie84> any help for me plzz :(
[21:24:29] <Lucky--> ericw: 80% of my clients are on a NDA/NCND basis
[21:24:42] <ericw> i believe you
[21:25:52] <Lucky--> ericw: so fix those errors first
[21:25:58] <Lucky--> and your code will work
[21:26:02] <Lucky--> most likely
[21:26:05] <Lucky--> 80% chance
[21:26:25] <ericw> hmmmmm
[21:26:37] <ericw> you say there's a htc file missing?
[21:26:57] <Lucky--> ericw: http://css3pie.com/
[21:27:16] <ericw> this is commented in the code: <!--[if lt IE 10]>
[21:27:16] <ericw> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://blogs.salesforce.com/js/PIE.js"></script>
[21:27:16] <ericw> <![endif]-->
[21:27:31] <ericw> uncomment?
[21:27:33] <Lucky--> http://css3pie.com/documentation/pie-js/
[21:28:17] <Lucky--> see if you have a Pie.htc anywhere in the directory structure, then you can do behavior: url(path/to/PIE.htc);
[21:28:53] <ericw> there is
[21:29:12] <Lucky--> k go copy paste that behavior in to every css class
[21:29:18] <ericw> it's in /js/PIE.htc
[21:29:21] <Lucky--> k
[21:29:24] <Lucky--> theres 2 ways
[21:29:27] <Lucky--> the js approach which is slow
[21:29:30] <Lucky--> and annoying
[21:29:32] <Lucky--> and requires js
[21:29:41] <Lucky--> and the paste it in every css tag method
[21:29:46] <Lucky--> which is annoying, but doesnt require js
[21:30:12] <ericw> haha
[21:30:26] <ericw> ok so it belongs in every CSS tag?
[21:30:29] <Lucky--> yea
[21:30:35] <Lucky--> and then take the js out
[21:30:50] <ericw> the commented js?
[21:30:56] <Lucky--> yea, and actually its not commented
[21:31:09] <Lucky--> those are preprocessor directives that IE actually reads
[21:31:09] <ericw> what is this going to do?
[21:31:15] <Lucky--> and will execute as commands
[21:31:42] <Lucky--> its going to make things render the way the dev meant them to, and make ie<8 support stuff like gradients, round corners, etc
[21:31:47] <ericw> 3400 line css file
[21:31:49] <ericw> ...
[21:31:53] <ericw> 2400
[21:31:54] <ericw> sorry
[21:33:29] <shoky> rookie84: here's one way. but there are nicer ways to achieve it.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cgyXj/1/
[21:34:20] <rookie84> shoky, great, thankyou!!
[21:34:31] <Lucky--> trade you your css,in exchange ill give you http://www.24-7cashadvance.com/CDN/Scripts/js
[21:35:31] <ericw> Lucky--: and what will this do?
[21:35:56] <Lucky--> Or must we?
[21:35:56] <Lucky--> PIE stands for Progressive Internet Explorer. It is an IE attached behavior which, when applied to an element, allows IE to recognize and display a number of CSS3 properties. Consider, if you will, the following CSS:
[21:36:20] <ericw> well i meant the js script you were linking to. lol
[21:36:46] <Lucky--> oh its libraries and functions i wrote for a landing page i have
[21:36:48] <ericw> there's a lot of rounded corners used in this template.. or was before
[21:36:50] <Lucky--> and for the web api
[21:38:55] <Lucky--> ericw: https://www.autoleadnow.com:8080/ALNWebServices.service/_help
[21:39:45] <ericw> lol that looks very useful
[21:39:52] <tw2113> i say do prefixes + border-radius for those browsers that can handle it
[21:39:53] <tw2113> and fuck the rest
[21:39:57] <ericw> but unfortunately i don't have th ebrainpower at the moment to absorb information like i normally do
[21:40:18] <tw2113> square corners have never killed anyone and they won't start now
[21:40:22] <ericw> tw2113: border-radius isn't even in use anymore except for the pagination buttons
[21:40:24] <ericw> that's about it
[21:40:27] <Lucky--> ericw: I started this project (for my self, 9 months ago, not knowing any C#/.net/js - now I do lol. no help. also no life for 9 months.)
[21:40:50] <tw2113> that PIE.htc isn't a worthy replacement for straight css
[21:40:56] <Lucky--> nope not at all
[21:40:58] <Lucky--> BUT
[21:41:07] <Lucky--> the idea is to get the page in a non erroring out fashion first
[21:41:28] <tw2113> delete the pie stuff and fix border radii later
[21:41:37] <ericw> would it be safe to just add it to the tags using border-radius?
[21:41:48] <Lucky--> ericw: yea
[21:42:38] <ericw> ok uploading it now
[21:42:55] <ericw> wow i hate typepad
[21:43:00] <ericw> uploaded and got an error
[21:43:16] <Lucky--> ericw: http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
[21:44:25] <ericw> ok new css uploaded
[21:44:33] <ericw> anything using border-radius has behavior: url(http://blogs.salesforce.com/js/PIE.htc)

[21:45:24] <Lucky--> Uncaught ReferenceError: PIE is not defined jquery.template.js:72
[21:45:24] <Lucky--> (anonymous function)
[21:45:28] <Lucky--> err
[21:45:29] <Lucky--> https://dl.dropbox.com/0/view/n94xk2i831ovmpp/Apps/CloudShot/shot_9142012_94514_pm.jpeg
[21:45:39] <Lucky--> also get rid of wrongly linked css files
[21:45:48] <Lucky--> and change the meta viewport tag
[21:46:08] <Lucky--> and the xtend-web stats.js make it use change it from http to https
[21:46:40] <shoky> all this for 20 bucks, huh
[21:46:46] <ericw> haha
[21:47:08] <ericw> Lucky--: the wrongly linked CSS files actually were deleted on purpose
[21:47:15] <ericw> those contain css that will fix the header for *most* of the pages
[21:47:21] <Lucky--> shoky: I've gone through $38,000 self funded, cross collaterized my equity in my dispensary, and not taken a paycheck in 8 months. lol.
[21:47:34] <Lucky--> startups (yay)
[21:47:48] <Lucky--> and im only 26
[21:47:53] <Lucky--> (yay)
[21:47:53] <shoky> i don't really understand half of the words you just said, but lol
[21:48:07] <tw2113> what are these words you people use
[21:48:12] <ericw> i understood
[21:48:14] <ericw> dispensary
[21:48:15] <ericw> ;)
[21:48:16] <ericw> jkjk haha
[21:48:49] <ericw> so what's this uncaught reference error about, Lucky--
[21:48:56] <Lucky--> I spent my money on building a software platform, paying all the legal and startup costs out of pocket, and living. I am now broke till I finish this. $20 sounds good.
[21:49:21] <shoky> gotcha ;p
[21:49:31] <shoky> i was just teasing
[21:49:40] <Lucky--> oh and half way through that I obtained a utility patent just for the process i patented to have the FCC change a regulation that made it illegal, had to scrap it
[21:50:09] <shoky> sounds derpy
[21:50:14] <Lucky--> sucked :-(
[21:50:43] <shoky> i take it the software platform wasn't profitable
[21:51:06] <Lucky--> shoky: oh its extremely platform, and I have the contracts secured, im just a 1 man army building an n-tier cloud solution
[21:51:10] <Lucky--> *profitable
[21:52:17] <shoky> so, IRC for an hour make some bucks for food, then build n-tier armies the rest of the time, i see
[21:52:35] <Lucky--> shoky: its mainly to stare at something other then my code ive been staring at all day :-P
[21:52:44] <Lucky--> not really the $20, but the $20 doesnt hurt
[21:53:01] <shoky> ;p
[21:53:14] <ericw> Lucky--: I've commented out most of the stuff you complained about
[21:53:16] <ericw> :)
[21:53:36] <ericw> want to run that agian and see what comes up?
[21:53:40] <shoky> but you didn't download webstorm
[21:54:28] <ericw> Lucky--: are you in SF?
[21:56:44] <ericw> I can deliver $ so we can avoid paypal fees if so
[21:56:45] <ericw> lol
[21:58:19] <ericw> otherwise given your situation i'll cover the paypal fees
[21:59:00] <Lucky--> ericw: last week

[22:00:26] <Lucky--> lol
[22:00:48] <Lucky--> built fkin all that by myself :-(
[22:01:40] <ericw> nuts
[22:02:00] <beachandbytes> wow impressive Lucky--
[22:02:31] <beachandbytes> I've been having some issues with signalR causing slower load times on pages where it's implemented
[22:02:44] <Lucky--> beachandbytes: web api for those cases
[22:02:47] <beachandbytes> especially with pages implementing redirectToaction any ideas?
[22:03:19] <Lucky--> and then return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCodes.Redirect)
[22:03:41] <Lucky--> and set the Request.Headers.Location to your redirect url before returning that
[22:03:42] <Lucky--> ;-)
[22:04:15] <ericw> what do you want me to do next, mr Lucky--?
[22:04:20] <Lucky--> uh
[22:04:23] <ericw> still don't work
[22:04:24] <Lucky--> let me look
[22:04:25] <Lucky--> link?
[22:04:32] <Lucky--> lol
[22:04:35] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com/cloud/
[22:04:36] <ericw> lol
[22:04:42] * Lucky-- is tired, gonan throw coffee in the keurig
[22:04:52] <beachandbytes> I'll definitly try that, when i profile the pages right now I get a request that looks fine and about 2-3s of nothing, then finally the page loads, this 2-3s doesn't change regardless of the logic in controllers
[22:05:16] <Lucky--> beachandbytes: web api is lean and fast
[22:05:28] <Lucky--> much faster then the regular Controller too
[22:05:29] <Lucky--> 	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width;minimum-scale=0.5,maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=1;" />
[22:05:31] <Lucky--> change that

[22:06:02] <Lucky--> beachandbytes: my biz partner knows jack shit about code, keeps wondering why its taking soo long
[22:06:04] <Lucky--> :-(
[22:06:09] <Lucky--> its cuz i'd rather do it right
[22:06:30] <beachandbytes> Ya, i haven't had the change to work with web api yet hopefully next project, im pretty much done with this just optiming but this 2-3s on these pages seems like forever with the responsiveness of the pages
[22:06:32] <Lucky--> so when im done i can hire a team and delegate it to them to work on
[22:06:43] <Lucky--> beachandbytes: web api is SIMPLE
[22:06:44] <beachandbytes> I can definitly eliminate the redirecttoaction but will lose some modularity in doing so
[22:06:55] <Lucky--> lol i actually have a working sample project saved
[22:07:11] <Lucky--> that i showed someone that just simply returns a picture as a stream
[22:07:20] <ericw> Lucky--: done
[22:07:54] <beachandbytes> Ya my work thinks im magic :), but i work with unidata and Sb and a bunch of obscure tech

[22:14:28] <Lucky--> gotta have a few in the rotation keeps you level headed
[22:14:33] <beachandbytes> rodd its just a metaphor for delegates
[22:14:36] <Lucky--> and making the right choice, not the emotional one
[22:14:38] <ericw> haha, yeah i did that once. she blamed me for "flirting with her friend" so i took her friend out to dinner
[22:14:59] <ericw> i found a pretty cool chinese girl that graduated from stanford

[23:08:37] <huntedmitch> Hey guys, question on jQuery UI Autocomplete. I know when I set up a custom data source I can return label and value, but is there a way I can easily add a url to the links without doing full custom data? I had hoped I could just return a uri variable, but it's not that simple.
[23:08:44] <ruby_on_tails> why does google chrome fetch plusone.js on any page even if its not called for ?
[23:11:24] <huntedmitch> nm
[23:15:49] <gt3> i have a $.ajax call that sends a number in the request to the server, and also uses that same number in a callback that saves it in an array, from the success response, but since it's asynchronous the numbers don't match. What can i do to make them match other than making it synchronous?
[23:21:08] <ccunni> good evening #jquery.
[23:21:19] <ccunni> I have a mouse position question... any takers?
[23:23:23] <syborg> ccunni: Just ask the question, if anyone here can help they will
[23:23:33] <ccunni> thanks
[23:24:58] <ccunni> i'd like to get the pageX/pageY of the mouse relative to the topmost frame in a scenario where the mouse may move over iframes.
[23:25:07] <ccunni> these iframes have my code running in them as well
[23:25:36] <ccunni> and are not necessarilly in the same domain/origin as the top frame
[23:25:53] <ccunni> i have a good rpc mechanism in place using easy xdm
[23:26:02] <ccunni> and we can assume my code is running in all rames
[23:27:14] <ccunni> One approach i've considered: tell the inner frames their position from the topmost frame via rpc before setting up mouse tracking, and then offset the pageX pageY of mousemove events in the inner frames with that position
[23:27:35] <ccunni> but this bites when the page is resized or if the frames are dynamically moved in the layout
[23:28:06] <ccunni> so i'm looking for something else
[23:28:59] <ccunni> screenX/screenY don't look too promising
[23:34:31] <ccunni> guess its a bit late ;)
[23:40:51] <Spikes> ccunni, i had to deal with similar problem. What i did, is set up iframe and after them div that works as an overlay for when that frame is not active
[23:42:19] <ccunni> thanks Spikes. Does the div block the natural cursor changes as you mouse over links, buttons, etc?
[23:42:52] <Spikes> ccunni, if those elements are in iframe, then yes, it would block them
[23:43:01] <ccunni> :(
[23:43:48] <ccunni> spikes, unfortunately, my inner iframes have interactive content which the user will want to click/drag/scroll while I'm actively tracking the mouse
[23:45:37] <Spikes> ccunni, you may try running mouse tracking code inside of the frame and then run outside function from inside (window.opener...)? Then based on iframe offset add left/top to the data that you pass from the inside
[23:46:23] <Spikes> I've never tried that approach myself, so can't guarantee if it'll work
[23:48:35] <ccunni> Spikes, you may be onto something :), I think I can pass this mouse tracking message up to the parent frame via my rpc mechanism and dynamically compute the offsets at the time of the mouse movement then.
[23:48:42] <ccunni> Will give this a shot!
[23:48:49] <ccunni> thanks
[23:49:58] <Spikes> ccunni, you're welcome. Hope it'll work
