[00:25:13] <thestereobus> anli__: what happens if you send .slider({value: 30}) after the initial min and max?
[00:25:20] <thestereobus> as a separate .slider call
[00:28:06] <anli__> thestereobus: I tried that without luck
[00:28:36] <thestereobus> bummer. I despise jQuery UI, personally.  you using any other jquery ui widgets?
[00:28:47] <thestereobus> or just the slider?
[00:29:08] <Cork> anli__: have you been able to reproduce it in a minimalistic fiddle yet?
[00:29:21] <anli__> nope, will do
[00:29:48] <thestereobus> because there's this http://refreshless.com/nouislider/
[00:29:52] <thestereobus> if you don't need the rest of jQuery UI
[00:30:08] <Cork> if you do its possible to follow what happens behind the seens and see whats the cause
[00:32:31] <diomeo> guy can anyone tells me own feedback about this site http://bitfungus.org
[00:32:56] <diomeo> we would like to make it helpful to developers/designers so any request will be appriaciated so much
[00:37:14] <bezudar_> Hi
[00:37:37] <bezudar_> I am having trouble sending a crossdomain ajax json request
[00:37:44] <bezudar_> its not getting recieved on server
[00:37:51] <rabbi1> $('a').attr('href #something').addClass('active'); is this correct if i have to add a class to <a> tag where its href="#something".. ?
[00:38:12] <bezudar_> the jfiddle code is here.http://jsfiddle.net/AynLX/3/
[00:38:56] <systemfault> diomeo: I find the background distracting
[00:39:12] <Cork> bezudar_: that server doesn't support cross domain ajax calls
[00:39:26] <systemfault> diomeo: Personally.. I would lover the opacity of that scrolling background layer to .25 or even .15
[00:39:28] <bezudar_> if i add
[00:39:32] <Cork> rabbi1: no
[00:39:34] <bezudar_> accept origin
[00:39:38] <bezudar_> will it support then
[00:39:53] <rabbi1> Cork: should use contains,, not finding it... can u help
[00:40:04] <Cork> rabbi1: $('a[href="#something"]').addClass('active');
[00:40:11] <diomeo> @systemfault oh great me i love less opacity always will see what i should do with that ;) thx!!
[00:40:27] <Cork> bezudar_: yes in none ie browsers
[00:40:44] <rabbi1> Cork: so simple...? :) wondering in the API.. thanks
[00:40:47] <Cork> bezudar_: ie doesn't support cross domain cors headers
[00:41:08] <diomeo> the fact is that we would like to add more features if possible, make it more helpful we can, and we have finished ideas for now %)
[00:41:10] <Cork> rabbi1: its the same syntax you would use in css
[00:41:23] <bezudar_> @cork thanks
[00:41:24] <b-ot> bezudar_, I'm a bot you know...
[00:41:28] <diomeo> sorry for dummy english
[00:41:36] <Cork> bezudar_: a better option is prob to use jsonp
[00:41:58] <bezudar_> @cork ya am looking into it I think that would work
[00:49:31] <xdjuj> diomeo you should accept GIF images :)
[00:50:28] <diomeo> but we love png :D
[00:50:52] <MagePsycho> anyone using javascript code from menucool.
[00:51:35] <diomeo> @xdjuj the web is full of png %))
[00:51:59] <xdjuj> Yep but you should accept GIF too :)
[00:52:07] <xdjuj> The web is full of GIF :)
[00:52:26] <xdjuj> When we submit with an error in the form, you loose the tags
[00:52:35] <diomeo> well :) it could be the fact is we would like to avoi animated gifs, if we realize that is possible sure!!
[00:54:59] <xdjuj> diomeo ok but GIF is not only used to do animated :)
[00:55:08] <diomeo> sure! ;)
[00:55:12] <xdjuj> You have a problem with your "cesure"
[00:55:25] <diomeo> what's cesure? )
[00:55:27] <xdjuj> Words are truncated every where :)
[00:55:46] <diomeo> uhm not catched sorry .. tells me more

[00:57:21] <xdjuj> HE on the third line
[00:57:40] <xdjuj> Hum depends on the nav :)
[00:57:56] <xdjuj> On FF (Mac) it's the "service" word wich is truncated
[00:58:00] <diomeo> omg
[00:58:02] <diomeo> you're right
[00:58:08] <diomeo> now catched really thx!!
[00:58:27] <diomeo> yep yep little bug i'll fix it surely!
[00:58:40] <xdjuj> That's the "break-all" line 835 in your CSS
[00:58:52] <diomeo> oh yess :D
[00:59:03] <xdjuj> word-break => break all is a bad idea :)
[00:59:51] <diomeo> sure, this is somenthing came out with the deploy :/
[01:06:31] <diomeo> @xdjuj check it now ;)
[01:07:18] <jammanbo> Is there a way to run a group of $.ajax requests, each async, but as a group act as if it were synchronised? I mean, let them all run at the same time, but block until they have all finished. Is this what promise is for?
[01:11:49] <ravenzz> I am experiencing a weird behavior with labels and the click event
[01:11:49] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/rUcr9/
[01:12:02] <ravenzz> the event is triggered two times
[01:12:09] <ravenzz> any idea why?
[01:15:51] <computer2000> can anyone tell me if there will be a (performance or other) problem with playing ~10 html5 videos on a page at the same time? is it actually possible, do browsers allow that?
[01:16:28] <jammanbo> ravenzz: Event bubbling. http://jsfiddle.net/rUcr9/2/
[01:16:56] <ravenzz> jammanbo yo dude, but
[01:17:21] <ravenzz> if the default action is prevented, the checkbox won't never be selected
[01:18:00] <jammanbo> oh, this is true
[01:18:50] <jammanbo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4649705/click-event-being-fired-twice-jquery
[01:19:45] <ravenzz> it is the same in js
[01:21:56] <ravenzz> jamesgorrie make sense
[01:22:06] <ravenzz> let me try it
[01:28:58] <ravenzz> jammanbo that helped, http://jsfiddle.net/rUcr9/3/
[01:45:23] <Christer> Does Ajax requests submit its request with the session of the client?
[01:46:20] <ThJ> I'm using Sortable for a playlist, and I've got a problem with the defaults. I'm using :nth-child(odd) in my CSS to make my rows alternate in background color, and this looks wrong because Sortable doesn't actually remove the row when you drag it. I can't seem to construct an "odd numbered visible rows" CSS selector. I'd rather not have to manually set styles on the list, because this is harder to keep track of, and slows down the GUI somewhat for
[01:46:20] <ThJ> long playlists.
[01:47:31] <Christer> Thj, You could allways trigger a function that redraws the table style.
[01:49:30] <damian_^> hi, is there any holo theme (android ics) for jqm?
[01:49:57] <damian_^> its all thats stopping me switching over from kendo mobile
[01:50:31] <Christer> damian_^: https://github.com/jjoe64/jquery-mobile-android-theme
[01:51:23] <Christer> damian_^: http://dribbble.com/shots/640482-Jquery-Mobile-theme-inspired-by-Holo-Light-for-Android-4-0
[01:51:35] <damian_^> hehe you have hit the same google search as me
[01:51:59] <damian_^> unfortunately those are just a recolouring rather than the controls being changed
[01:52:56] <damian_^> thank you though
[01:53:01] <Christer> Well, Honestly. Im an iOS user. I have no idea how the theme looks like on the phone! :P
[01:53:01] <ThJ> Christer: Merg, setting explicit row styles is precisely what I'm trying to avoid :| If only I could tell Sortable to simply remove the item from the list altogether until the drag is finished. That's probably something the programmer tried hard to avoid doing, but that's exactly what would solve the problem.
[01:53:19] <damian_^> ok not a problem :)
[01:53:49] <damian_^> i might just have to be the one who creates it
[01:53:58] <damian_^> would be a good project for me
[01:53:59] <Christer> Go for it! :D
[01:55:34] <ThJ> Having to set the style kind of messes with the nice hiearchy of inheritance and convenience functions I have set up for my custom list classes.
[01:56:14] <ThJ> I can't set the style in the addSong function because then it'll set the styles 100 times for a 100 item playlist, but it must be called if a single song is added...
[01:59:18] <BinaryKitten> ThJ how are you doing it at the moment?
[01:59:36] <ThJ> BinaryKitten: :nth-child(odd) { background-color: … }
[02:01:02] <BinaryKitten> thought about using $(selector).removeClass('odd').filter(':odd').addClass('odd')
[02:03:18] <BinaryKitten> then attaching the background color to .odd in css
[02:04:04] <ThJ> BinaryKitten: Thing is, if I add that to my addSong() function, that's gonna make addSong an O(n^2) function, because it'll have to run the filter on an increasing number of items.
[02:04:36] <BinaryKitten> and?
[02:04:48] <BinaryKitten> i think you may be prematurely optimising there
[02:06:16] <ThJ> BinaryKitten: In my experience, doing JQuery stuff on many elements tends to make stuff real slow…
[02:06:38] <BinaryKitten> depends on if you're iterating through them and doing 1 action on all of them
[02:06:39] <ThJ> Eh, it's just an ugly solution, forces style data into the code, etc.
[02:07:21] <BinaryKitten> also, there's no style data .. just a class (which the style is using yes) but it's not actually appending style data to each
[02:07:59] <BinaryKitten> again i'd recommend doing performance testing on each
[02:08:40] <BinaryKitten> because optimising it right this moment, when it's not working right, isn't going to help you get it working right
[02:08:54] <ThJ> Well, I used such a solution before. Can't recall what was the problem, but there was something I found unacceptable about it.
[02:09:29] <ThJ> Thanks anyway.
[02:09:45] <BinaryKitten> no problems. wish i could be more help
[02:11:43] <ThJ> I'm more of a systems programmer (C++ and such) than a web programmer. These web standards always leave out rather crucial usage cases.
[02:14:58] <damian_^> anyone here know kendo?
[02:42:22] <treeprogram> I want the cookie value stored on the user's browser to determine which of the two radio buttons that are outputted dynamically by PHP is selected, any advice on how I can do that?
[02:42:27] <treeprogram> I could do it more easily by just having the radio buttons there from the beginning and toggling their display value when an event occurs, but I'd like to see if it's possible to do the same thing for dynamic content
[02:47:31] <Whirl3d_> what two radio buttons are you talking about?
[02:52:35] <Hapaa> treeprogram a cookie is irrelevant
[02:53:22] <treeprogram> Hapaa how so?
[02:53:53] <Whirl3d_> This is only slightly off topic considering I need this for a second WP install...I would like to redirect traffic from members.mydomain.com to mydomain.com/members (which is a wp installation)...how do I do this?
[02:55:39] <treeprogram> Whirl3d_ I want to PHP to output two radio buttons, and two elements, both 'display:none' by default. Each radio button will assign a 'block' value to one element's display property and a 'none' value to the other element's. If a user selected one of the radio buttons in a previous session though, I want that stored in a cookie, and used to pre-select one of the radio buttons when they're outputted as html
[02:56:13] <treeprogram> that was properly a bad explanation
[02:56:16] <treeprogram> *probably
[02:57:07] <Whirl3d_> Okay, that sounds like you need to know how to use php more than WP...have you asked for help in #php? (if that sounded rude, I really didn't mean it to)
[02:58:06] <kiamorot> Hello gyus. I hava a little problem (not sure yet if is on Jquery or my code) which happens on a jquery function. Lets introduce you in the scenario. I am polling data from a server through web sockets and i updated every second a certain information in a table in my html markup. I need that to work when I have opened more than one window elements (tabs or browser instances). So i update the same data to every window instance and eve
[02:59:39] <kiamorot> So far what it happens is that when i recieve (on my second window, have one already running and updating data of the table) the data in my onmessage handler i parse it with Jquery.jsonparse() and i got typerror as the return value of the method is null.
[03:00:07] <kiamorot> Any ideas? You can, of course, ask questions.
[03:01:06] <shoky> kiamorot: return value of which method is null?
[03:01:11] <treeprogram> Whirl3d_ no problem. The reason I think it might be a JS/jQuery problem is that I need the html outputted by PHP to interact with the client-side JS/jQuery code to retrieve and make use of the cookie value.
[03:01:28] <kiamorot> shoky: jsonparse method
[03:02:08] <shoky> kiamorot: does the json string get received ok or not?
[03:02:23] <treeprogram> Whirl3d_ oh nevermind, I thought you were responding to me..
[03:02:35] <kiamorot> shoky: yes. cause i am already running one tabs where the info is updated
[03:02:47] <shoky> kiamorot: not sure what you're asking..
[03:03:07] <shoky> kiamorot: end of your long sentence got chopped off, also
[03:03:55] <shoky> kiamorot: so it gets received ok.. and you're calling $.parseJSON on a valid JSON string..? and it returns null?
[03:07:04] <kiamorot> shoky: hold on
[03:09:13] <kiamorot> shoky: correction: is not properly sent
[03:09:21] <kiamorot> logically it fails
[03:10:05] <kiamorot> thing is a moment ago i was observing is in both consoles from web dev tools

[03:53:59] <faraway> voot545: imho it should always be in document order
[03:54:30] <jds> I could do something along the lines of  if (elem.is(':animated')) elem.queue(callback); else callback()  - just wondered if there was a neater way
[03:54:30] <voot545> no offense but I'm not looking for an opinion :/
[03:54:48] <faraway> voot545: ;)  i'm pretty sure :D

[04:03:42] <beasty> pondering if it's possible to $.get('') a rendered dom
[04:06:28] <tolborg> It is common to use js to recreate a select list for custom styling. The original select list is hidden and recreated using styleable elements like divs and spans. This approach is fine for desktop, but so far I havent seen examples of such a custom dropdown activating the iPhone select wheel. Is this at all possible? And how?

[06:18:27] <tomasm-> hi, i have some code (autogrow plugin) that gets the line-height of a textarea, and tries to parse it numerically, unfortunately it is not a number at all, but 'normal' .... is there a way to translate that into a numeric size, without explicitly setting it via css?
[06:19:56] <computer_> how can i get the height of the iOS mobile safari address bar?
[06:21:19] <NodeX> tomasm- : no
[06:21:41] <NodeX> you can only get the computed height with height()
[06:21:44] <shoky> tigger1: bind to the 'open' event and call  .tooltip('close') after a timeout
[06:23:30] <tomasm-> NodeX, ok well even with height() I need to somehow figure out an approximate line height, is there a way to figure the # of lines?
[06:23:38] <tomasm-> (and then divide the two)
[06:24:08] <NodeX> tomasm- : you can try to get the font-size
[06:27:34] <tomasm-> NodeX, so whats the correlation between font-size and line-height ? assuming it's 'normal' ? should I multiply the font-size by a fudge factor?
[06:28:06] <NodeX> font-size is roughly line height minus a couple of PX
[06:28:42] <NodeX> it depends how accurate you need it to be, dont forget number of lines depends on the width of the element it's in also
[06:29:06] <tomasm-> so add 5px, or multiply * 1.15 ?
[06:29:30] <NodeX> I dont know the exact figure
[06:34:04] <tomasm-> ok well I just changed it in the css to 1.2em, and it seems to be fine...... chrome unfortunately returns 'normal' unless explicit in the css

[06:45:03] <Rickardo1> Hi, is there any specific jquery mobile channel?
[06:46:08] <meanyface> anew: indeed. sup?
[06:46:46] <anew> one sec have a pastebin for u
[06:46:52] <NodeX> Drager : $('.class p:first');
[06:47:41] <Roelb> Hi all, small question I can't find in the issue trackers, but maybe is intended behaviour: Setup: a page that fills up the viewport with content and has a form element on the bottom, Action: you tap the textarea, and the keyboard appears. On Android we have an issue: the keyboard displays itself on top of the textarea, instead below it. You can not scroll to see what you are typing. On iOS, this is not an issue, it lifts the browser 
[06:47:58] <Roelb> It feels more an Android/HTC problem to me, but is there a workaround?
[06:48:10] <anew> http://pastebin.com/v13ea3EX partial pastebin fail.  but meanyface, when u sing require and the function call inside of it - how do you make the data inside dynamic? i'm just a little confused all the examples i've seen it was static
[06:48:13] <Drager> NodeX: Thank you
[06:48:20] <NodeX> ;)
[06:48:30] <anew> this is found inside <script> tags
[06:48:42] <aquatix> Roelb: does chrome do the same?
[06:48:44] <anew> do you just php from the server ?
[06:48:50] <aquatix> or only the default browser
[06:48:55] <anew> dunno
[06:49:39] <inv3nt0r> Good morning everyone... Getting this error in FireBug: Permission denied to access property 'toString' --- My page is built from two iframes, do I need to target a specific frame when using this code: $("#noTarget").attr("target", "");
[06:50:40] <Roelb> aquatix: No, Chrome handles it like iOS
[06:51:02] <Roelb> Seems to be HTC browser issue
[06:52:31] <aquatix> Roelb: i think i remember reading about such issues; sometimes blur and refocus help
[06:52:34] <meanyface> anew: so you want to make the properties of the object you are passing to Browse.initFeedPage() dynamic instead of hard-coding them?
[06:52:40] <aquatix> a google search on that might help
[06:52:52] <Roelb> ok, thanks aquatix
[06:53:02] <aquatix> Roelb: but it stays hairy :)
[06:53:07] <Roelb> will try that, and report the issue to HTC
[06:53:14] <anew> yes exactly meanyface
[06:53:15] <aquatix> good luck :)
[06:53:32] <aquatix> Roelb: there are some tricks floating around
[06:55:25] <meanyface> anew: I'm not really familiar with the bootstap + requirejs use case. Seems like you could have require request a JSON endpoint to pull the values in for you. Where do you intend to get the values?
[06:57:12] <anew> getting the values from database ?
[06:57:39] <moai>  hi. I'm a beginner and am struggling to get the value of a jquery spinner ui-element. I believe the problem is in my javascript code. This is the code: "var spinnerValue = $("numSearchResults").spinner("value");"
[06:57:47] <moai> then spinnerValue is a [object Object] instead of a number
[06:58:37] <anew> pull from json endpoint?
[07:00:04] <meanyface> anew: that's what makes sense to me. Put together an AJAX endpoint which gathers data from the db and spits out JSON. Then either request it within your callback or have Require request it via a JSON plugin.
[07:00:46] <anew> hmmm ok thanks let me try something like that
[07:00:59] <meanyface> anew: seems like something that would cache well also.
[07:06:21] <shoky> shesek: have you looked into .contents() ?
[07:07:06] <shesek> shoky, yeah, I found it eventually. I tried it before, but I had another problem that caused me to think it didn't work. thanks
[07:07:08] <Roelb> @aquatix: tweeted HTC about the bug, let's see if they monitor that.. couldn't find a bug tracker.
[07:07:32] <Krambiorix> hi guys, this doesn't give me the full height of my iframe, can someone help ?   http://pastebin.com/nHENPHvx
[07:07:57] <inv3nt0r> Hey all... can anyone here tell me how to change an attribute of an element inside of an iframe? I'm trying this but getting errors: $("#iframe_content").contents().find("#noTarget").attr("target", "");
[07:08:22] <shoky> inv3nt0r: is the iframe in a different domain
[07:08:52] <Krambiorix> shoky, no
[07:09:17] <inv3nt0r> shoky: no, the two iframes are both in the same domain I believe...
[07:09:19] <shoky> what errors?
[07:09:28] <shoky> two iframes?
[07:09:37] <inv3nt0r> shoky: Permission denied to access property 'toString'
[07:09:42] <Krambiorix> shoky, it gives me the height of the viewport and not of the content
[07:09:53] <Krambiorix> shoky, no, just one iframe
[07:09:56] <shoky> er Krambiorix i wasn't talking to you ;]
[07:10:27] <moai> i've put all the spinner initialization, and access code here for reference: http://pastebin.com/fhPEgRQ1
[07:10:45] <moai> the error message I get is "min not defined"
[07:10:49] <Krambiorix> shoky, ok then it was fyi
[07:11:41] <BillCriswell> moai: Do you want Math.min() ?
[07:14:06] <aqeel> why do we use doubele not bit operator as it results theoretically back to square one.....~~x = x
[07:14:12] <moai> BillCriswell, yes, actually, that was the problem
[07:14:15] <moai> thank you
[07:14:23] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[07:14:29] <shoky> Krambiorix: the iframe body's height will be limited by the iframe size
[07:15:33] <Krambiorix> shoky, so what can i do about it
[07:15:34] <Krambiorix> ?
[07:15:58] <aqeel> since ~ = -(x+1) and ~~ = -(-(x+1)+1) = x
[07:16:31] <shoky> aqeel: a logical NOT brings you back to square one.. a bitwise NOT, not neccesarilly
[07:16:47] <aqeel> please explain?
[07:17:07] <shoky> but aqeel: it's mostly used as a quick way to turn a value into an integer
[07:17:34] <BillCriswell> ~~~~~ @x = -(34).3
[07:17:34] <aqeel> ic so mostly it is used for conversion
[07:17:41] <BillCriswell> I can do that too!
[07:17:48] <sunbeam> how can I best search for a visible (display: block) .content-part ?
[07:17:55] <shoky> aqeel: and sometimes its also used as a fast way to do Math.floor
[07:18:08] <shoky> well i guess that's the same usage
[07:18:13] <NodeX> hidden elements sunbeam ?
[07:18:17] <aqeel> but ~ should be suffice why ~~
[07:18:26] <NodeX> iirc there is a :hidden psuedo selector
[07:18:28] <shoky> aqeel: ~ doesnt give you the same value at all
[07:18:36] * hlve slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[07:18:41] * shoky sits on hlve
[07:18:46] <hlve> o;
[07:18:52] <shoky> this is what i do, this is what i do, this is what i do
[07:18:54] <shoky> i sit on you
[07:18:59] <aqeel> lol
[07:19:08] <sunbeam> NodeX: yea sorry
[07:19:11] <Krambiorix> anyone else? :  this doesn't give me the full height of my iframe, can someone help ?   http://pastebin.com/nHENPHvx
[07:19:15] <hlve> lol
[07:19:24] <shoky> Krambiorix: what do you mean "what can i do about it" ??
[07:19:32] <sunbeam> NodeX: I mean, visible elements
[07:19:32] <aqeel> so if jslint gives crap for this ~~, is there any alternative
[07:19:33] <shoky> Krambiorix: you cant magically get a height that isn't there
[07:19:46] <sunbeam> how can i check how much nth-child the current clicked <a> is?
[07:19:55] <NodeX> I think there is :visible too
[07:19:56] <shoky> Krambiorix: think of it like the iframe size is the window-size, as far as the iframe's document is concerned..
[07:20:12] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[07:20:35] <dorong> hey
[07:20:55] <NodeX> sunbeam : index iirc
[07:21:08] <aqeel> since ~ is equavalent -(x+1), can they be replaced?
[07:21:11] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:21:39] <shoky> aqeel:
[07:21:49] <Krambiorix> shoky, so there is no way to get that actual iframe height
[07:21:50] <Krambiorix> ?
[07:21:56] <shoky> ?eval var x = 'lol'; -(x+1)
[07:21:57] <dorong> if I have multiple event listeners on the same custom event, what is the order in which the callbacks will get executed ?
[07:21:59] <bot-t> shoky: NaN
[07:22:02] <sunbeam> NodeX: thanks
[07:22:02] <shoky> huh.
[07:22:15] <NodeX> the order they're bound in
[07:22:20] <shoky> o right.
[07:22:44] <shoky> Krambiorix:  what do you mean by actual iframe height
[07:22:50] <sunbeam> NodeX: $(".tabbed-content .tabs a").click(function() { alert($(this).index()) }
[07:22:53] <sunbeam> something like this?
[07:23:09] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: There is a :visible selector.
[07:23:13] <Krambiorix> shoky, the height of the content in the iframe
[07:23:24] <shoky> Krambiorix: which element?
[07:23:29] <NodeX> sunbeam : try it and see
[07:23:56] <Krambiorix> shoky : body
[07:24:23] <shoky> Krambiorix: what makes you say that its giving you the wrong height
[07:24:32] <aqeel> Krambiorix: http://api.jquery.com/height/
[07:24:46] <hlve> BOOTSTRAP UPDATED
[07:24:47] <hlve> Hm
[07:24:47] <shoky> also yeah, use .height()
[07:25:05] <aqeel> example make use of iframe
[07:25:05] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: You may also want outerHeight()
[07:25:51] <shoky> Krambiorix: <body> will be the same size as the containing window pretty much,  elements INSIDE body might be higher
[07:26:06] <shoky> hmm thats not right is it
[07:26:22] <shoky> ill shuddup
[07:26:28] <aqeel> lol
[07:26:30] <dorong> NodeX, event if on is bound with "on" and another with "one" ?
[07:27:01] <ravenzz> does jquery converts ems into px when using css()?
[07:27:04] <NodeX> dorong : the binds go in order else it would be silly to never know the order or have jquery change it
[07:27:30] <dorong> NodeX, ok thanks
[07:27:33] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: When you're reading it maybe, not setting it.
[07:27:37] <BillCriswell> Let me double check, though
[07:28:01] <aqeel> NodeX: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[07:28:17] <Krambiorix> thx anyway shoky :p
[07:29:16] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: I was correct.
[07:29:33] <ravenzz> the thing is that it gets the height in px, but margins are in ems and the result is a mess
[07:29:58] <aqeel> so change to pixel
[07:30:00] <ravenzz> I'll make a fiddle one sec
[07:30:04] <NodeX> aqeel : It';s not me who wants it
[07:30:15] <ravenzz> aqeel I am not going to change the css because of js
[07:30:33] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, this.outerHeight() --> is not a function
[07:30:38] <aqeel> or use jquery to internally grasp the value and convert it to pixel so cssis ems and javascricpt is px
[07:30:48] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: $(this)
[07:31:39] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, it's also 596 px  which is much lower than the content in the iframe
[07:32:37] <aqeel> u no ned to if you do not want to...just an option and opinion on posibilities
[07:32:45] <hlve> wat
[07:33:04] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/VTj87/2/ I'm getting pixels here.
[07:34:25] <shoky> Krambiorix: when you inspect the iframe's <body> with your devtools, what height does it say ?
[07:35:11] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/VTj87/3/ getting it for all of them here.
[07:36:15] <aqeel> nice one BillCriswell
[07:36:16] <NodeX> ravenzz : perhaps this can help (the code at least) http://filamentgroup.com/lab/update_jquery_plugin_for_retaining_scalable_interfaces_with_pixel_to_em_con/
[07:36:23] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/QhaNd/
[07:36:26] <ravenzz> here I am
[07:37:12] <yaya> hello all
[07:37:32] <yaya> can anyone help me with an a problem i'm experiencing with jQuery UI Accordion?
[07:37:43] <BillCriswell> The result window isn't loading up for me. I feel like it's been doing this a lot lately
[07:37:54] <NodeX> Same here on first try
[07:38:13] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, when i inspect it, i don't see the iframe
[07:38:16] <ravenzz> eh actually it is loaded, they are just
[07:38:25] <ravenzz> out of the screen >> my issue
[07:39:12] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, it's like the iframe is not there
[07:39:32] <ravenzz> maybe I solved it
[07:40:01] <yaya> anyone?
[07:40:01] <BillCriswell> I just tried to reload with no luck.
[07:40:01] <BillCriswell> It also took forever.
[07:40:07] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/QhaNd/1/
[07:40:22] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: Oh. I'm on OSX, no scroll bars lol.
[07:40:39] <BillCriswell> The very few times I hate this OS is when this happens... I know it's an option.
[07:43:15] <shoky> ?ask @ yaya
[07:43:16] <bot-t> yaya, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:45:01] <yaya> Sorry. My jQuery accordion is breaking in IE7 and IE8.  Works fine in Chrome, FF, and IE9.  The page is here: http://offers.pli.edu/employment-law-winter
[07:45:13] <yaya> and I have no idea why.
[07:46:37] <aqeel> how are you testing for ie7 and ie8
[07:47:07] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, when i try $(this).html()  it returns an empty string
[07:47:25] <yaya> @aqeel ie developer tools
[07:48:08] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: You're using an iFrame so I'm not sure what you need. I think maybe .contents()?
[07:48:19] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I just don't work with many iFrames
[07:49:18] <jeremy-> If anybody has used datatables a bit, can anybody explain to me why I cant use jQuery.extend or even loop through my associative array to put data into the fnServerParams (send extra get data to datatables)
[07:51:25] <jeremy-> ref: http://www.datatables.net/ref#fnServerParams
[07:51:27] <shoky> yaya: first of all you're including jquery more than once
[07:51:42] <aqeel> do not use third party simulation, ietester, microsoft super preview, or built in developemnt tools...ie 7 as ie6, ie 8 as ie 7 and 6, ie 9 as ie 8,7,6.....please use xpmode or original machines with those installed... yaya
[07:52:30] <jeremy-> When I manually aoData.push ( { "key" : "value", "key" : "value" } ) it works fine, when i try and use jquery's extend to merge another array with this, it doesnt work.
[07:52:46] <aqeel> i have been in those problems my self....rectified by xp mode, 3 enviorment with ie,6,7,8 installed
[07:54:00] <yaya> @shoky Okay. Wordpress queues its own version of jQuery via a hook at bottom of </head>.  Just removed hook for now so only jsapi jQuery is version and problem still persists.
[07:54:06] <aqeel> simulation is not 100% carbon copy of older version
[07:57:34] <inv3nt0r> Hey again everyone... I'm getting pretty close but still having trouble. Should this code here remove the target attribute from a link with id="noTarget"?  	$("#noTarget").removeAttr("target");
[07:58:48] <inv3nt0r> NM still getting the Permission denied to access property 'toString' error
[08:02:03] <yaya> aqeel: downloading xpmode and vpc now.  Will test when finished.  In the meantime, both the page in question http://offers.pli.edu/employment-winter-a AND http://offers.pli.edu/litigation-treatises-a both use the same format for the jQuery UI accordion, but only the former seems to not be working when simulated in IE7/IE8.  Do you have any ideas as to why?
[08:05:16] <aqeel> yaya one point to note, after installing xpmode, TURN OFF windows update....it will update you ie6 to ie8
[08:05:54] <aqeel> so manually install the necessary updates if necessary
[08:05:54] <yaya> aqeel: you mean on the virtual machine?
[08:05:59] <aqeel> yes
[08:06:11] <yaya> gotcha
[08:06:26] <aqeel> i got hit 3 times ....
[08:07:03] <aqeel> there is no choice but to reinstall gain if ie gets updated
[08:08:18] <aqeel> xpmode default is ie6, latest update for ie on xp is ie8, need to download ie7...
[08:10:08] <systemfault> Just download the testing VMs on the microsoft website
[08:10:32] <aqeel> xpmode is vm from microsoft
[08:11:03] <systemfault> It's still not a IE testing VM
[08:11:12] <aqeel> it is
[08:11:27] <aqeel> full xp machine with ie on it
[08:11:51] <systemfault> aqeel: Good luck installing more than once version of IE on it.
[08:11:52] <aqeel> as if you bought a xp machine
[08:12:00] <systemfault> I know that more than you do.
[08:12:04] <aqeel> i did and am using it
[08:12:30] <systemfault> aqeel: Anyway.. if you ever stop being stubborn... http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11575
[08:12:45] <NodeX> who are you talking to aqeel?
[08:14:26] <yaya> aqeel: tested on other machine while vm is d/l and accordion does not function
[08:14:34] <yaya> it appears jQuery is breaking but I'm not sure
[08:14:38] <yaya> any insight?
[08:15:06] <aqeel> yaya and systemfault --> NodeX
[08:15:52] <yaya> aqeel: you mean ask NodeX my question?
[08:16:00] <systemfault> My friend NodeX, master of the lulz.
[08:16:27] <aqeel> no he asked who i was talking to
[08:18:01] <yaya> Can anyone tell me why the jQuery accordion is not working on this page for ie7 and ie8: http://offers.pli.edu/employment-law-winter ?
[08:19:41] <aqeel> systemfault: the link you provided do not have ie6 and ie7 for win7.....xpmode?
[08:20:29] <hlve> lol
[08:20:41] <aqeel> and why do i need to bloat for xp,vista and win7, whereas xpmode can handle all three
[08:20:44] <NodeX> ah, I have systemfault ignored that's why I thought you were talking to yourself!
[08:20:59] <aqeel> lol
[08:21:55] <fission6>  whats a good pattern to change button text on slideToggle inside a click handler?
[08:22:02] <fission6> ie. show more, show less
[08:22:26] <systemfault> aqeel: The link I gave you are complete VMs with the browsers... MS supplies them for testing purpose
[08:22:50] <systemfault> aqeel: That way, you can keep your XP mode fully updated and have a testing VM for shitty browsers like IE6/IE7
[08:23:48] <aqeel> yes but not as xpmode...xp + vista + win7.....where as xpmode + win7 that is it
[08:25:15] <aqeel> xpmode can handle ie 6,7,8 ....whereas the link you provided there is no ie6 for win7, ie7 for win7....
[08:25:30] <katsh> http://jsfiddle.net/KepeX/ using obj.html(), but it returns undefined. howcome?
[08:26:33] <aqeel> anyway i would go xpmode rather than individual crap for ies
[08:26:54] <systemfault> katsh: Because it tries to get a '.cms-topbar-wrapper' element inside the "root element"
[08:27:41] <katsh> isn't that the point?
[08:27:47] <systemfault> aqeel: You cannot have the 3 versions of IE on the same VM
[08:27:47] <shoky> katsh: var response = $('<div>').append(data);
[08:28:13] <aqeel> it is 3 instances and yes are independent of each other
[08:28:14] <katsh> no i can't do that.
[08:28:21] <shoky> katsh: sure you can
[08:28:24] <katsh> i need to extract just that one div.
[08:28:31] <shoky> so?
[08:28:42] <shoky> katsh: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KepeX/1/
[08:28:56] <systemfault> katsh: "response" is that first div, no need to .find it
[08:29:52] <katsh> systemfault: that was for jsfiddle simplicity. 'data' would consist of more divs
[08:29:56] <katsh> and shoky, thanks.
[08:31:07] <aqeel> systemfault: http://blog.dotsmart.net/2009/06/24/using-windows-7s-xp-mode-to-run-ie-6-and-ie-7-side-by-side/
[08:32:08] <systemfault> aqeel: Nice trick, didn't know that.
[08:32:12] <aqeel> at that time ie9 was not out...thus we can create another instance and have it ie8..thus ie6,7,8,9 all together
[08:32:21] <aqeel> that is what i ahve done
[08:32:35] <aqeel> may be i know more than u do..
[08:32:59] <aqeel> that is xpmode
[08:33:20] <systemfault> You, of course.. know more than me on Virtual PC, I totally agree.
[08:34:02] <aqeel> aqeel: Anyway.. if you ever stop being stubborn... http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11575...so u take back??
[08:34:20] <systemfault> Yeah, I do
[08:34:40] <shoky> friends4life
[08:34:42] <systemfault> I have no problem taking back what I said when I'm wrong.
[08:36:01] <katsh> random question here just out of curiosity, is there a convenience method to replace $('#div').parent().html()
[08:36:15] <katsh> or is that the proper way of doing that
[08:36:27] <aqeel> well i am not stubborn nor do i have any intension of being it...i was telling the facts and one should listen before giving their opinions..by the way i have seen that site too....the link you provided
[08:36:58] <aqeel> when i first setup my xpmode
[08:37:29] <Andy1991> https://github.com/Andy-Holland/bQuery
[08:39:22] <shoky> katsh: no shorter way to do it
[08:39:29] <katsh> thanks.
[08:42:02] <Andy1991> What you guys think of this? https://github.com/Andy-Holland/bQuery it overrides the jquery init method to allow variable replacement in selectors
[08:42:39] <Andy1991> i.e. $('.find-%1-in-container', ['me'], '.container') resolves to $('.find-me-in-container', '.container')
[08:43:08] <shoky> is outerHTML now supported in all browsers?
[08:44:07] <Andy1991> Can use objects too i.e. $('#{selector}', {selector: 'container'}) resolves to $('#container')
[08:44:14] <aqeel> Andy1991: tough one and yes good one at that..
[08:44:49] <Andy1991> tough one?
[08:45:04] <aqeel> getting into the core of jquery
[08:45:26] <aqeel> yet not destryoing its behavior
[08:46:04] <Andy1991> Ahh, I know, but it doesn't alter the current interface, and if it's not used the only extra operation is if ( typeof context != 'undefined' )
[08:46:14] <yaya> Having issues troubleshooting jQuery UI Accordion breakage on http://offers.pli.edu/employment-law-winter/ as it doesn't work in IE7/IE8.  Any help/ideas?
[08:46:41] <shoky> katsh: if you dont care about firefox<11 i guess you can use .prop('outerHTML')
[08:47:00] <Andy1991> https://github.com/Andy-Holland/bQuery/blob/master/bQuery.js see
[08:47:34] <Andy1991> I just think it's a lot nicer than $('#' + selector)
[08:47:56] <Andy1991> Or if you're doing multiple interpolations, it gets messy
[08:48:26] <Andy1991> i.e. $('div'+ selector +':eq('+ index +')')
[08:48:54] <Andy1991> vs $('div%1:eq(%2)', ['.findme', '2'])
[08:49:08] <shoky> that's a good string formatting lib.. why tie it into jquery init method? it's not related at all
[08:49:28] <Andy1991> or $('div{selector}:eq({index})', {selector: '.findme', index: '2' });
[08:49:47] <roelb> aquatix: I am continueing testing, and with mobile chrome an comparable issue exists (1.2 final). Scenario: open a page, with form elements, add a footer that is not fixed. Put the input field center screen, tap it. Then the browser re-focuses to the input field, which is ok. But a millisecond later the footer bar is putting itself over the input field.
[08:49:57] <systemfault> In ten years.. we'll be able to use ES6 string interpolation :P
[08:50:08] <shoky> ;p
[08:50:19] <aqeel> :p
[08:50:29] <delinquentme> Ok so I've got a nice little $('.dingo')on('click', function(){}) thats working as expected  .. howveer the selector 'dingo'  returns the right object on console.log  .. but says I cant give it an .addClass()  http://jsfiddle.net/kfkb4/
[08:50:48] <delinquentme> ... do I need to pass in some kind of self-reference into the function?
[08:50:49] <shoky> delinquentme: $(this)
[08:51:01] <shoky> er
[08:51:03] <systemfault> delinquentme: The "this" inside the handler is a "DOM" node, you need to jQueryfy it.
[08:51:05] <shoky> and don't do function(this)
[08:51:08] <shoky> ever.
[08:51:45] <Andy1991> skqr: That's just the use case I created it for, it was annoying me, and I prefer it this way to $(format(...))
[08:51:49] <delinquentme> shoky, noted
[08:52:02] <systemfault> delinquentme: The first parameter in an event handler is an event object, so call it "event" or "e" or "ev" :P
[08:52:27] <shoky> p_EventObject
[08:52:45] <moai> hi. is it possible to use a jquery-ui spinner that is not editable, i.e. whose value can only be changed with the spinners?
[08:53:22] <Andy1991> skqr: How would youmplement it?
[08:53:37] <Drager> Why can't I do var.fadeToggle(duration)?
[08:54:28] <shoky> was Andy1991 talking to me
[08:54:30] <shoky> oh well.
[08:54:30] <Andy1991> oops
[08:54:37] <delinquentme> systemfault, that was a correction to what? ... the term "selector" ?
[08:54:39] <Andy1991> Nah, the guy who left
[08:54:41] <delinquentme> ( little lost )
[08:54:44] <fission6> anyone here work with google maps v3 and jquery having issues with slideDown and rendering the map correctly
[08:54:51] <Andy1991> I didn't notice lol
[08:55:02] <shoky> ok except he wasn't saying anything
[08:55:09] <Andy1991> Ohh sorry
[08:55:21] <Andy1991> I meant you then
[08:55:22] <Andy1991> lol
[08:55:59] <Andy1991> Sorry about that :$
[08:56:06] <shoky> Andy1991:  ok so i got a neat string formatting tied into the $() function... now i do:  var myJqObj = $('#{coolshit}', {coolshit:'yeaa'})
[08:56:31] <shoky> Andy1991: then.. i wanna find some element inside..  myJqObj.find('....  uhhh cant use the string formatting thingy here, its only in that one jq init method
[08:56:42] <shoky> just a stupid example of why it doesnt make sense to me the way you did it ;p
[08:56:58] <Andy1991> Hmm good point
[08:57:18] <Andy1991> I guess I shouldn't have written it at 3am lol
[08:57:32] <Andy1991> But TBF, I probably wouldn't have seen that anyway
[08:58:13] <shoky> man i suck.
[08:58:30] <Andy1991> lol why's that?
[08:58:45] <shoky> adunno, nevermind ;p
[08:58:52] <Andy1991> lol
[08:59:23] <Andy1991> So I should just implement a .format on the string proto or something?
[08:59:28] <Andy1991> Probably not .format tho
[08:59:40] <Andy1991> something with less potential conflicts
[09:01:27] <Andy1991> $('.find-%1-in-container'.format(['me']), '.container')
[09:01:34] <Andy1991> could work
[09:02:05] <Andy1991> Whay you think shoky?
[09:02:07] <delinquentme> annnd forced interpolation in jquery?
[09:02:22] <Andy1991> delinquentme: ?
[09:02:33] <delinquentme> Andy1991, like "#{}"  in ruby
[09:02:45] <delinquentme> IE take this string ... and evaluate it as the variable of that tname
[09:02:52] <Andy1991> Ahh
[09:03:04] <Andy1991> I had that with {}
[09:03:05] <delinquentme> .eval() ?
[09:03:06] <Andy1991> no #
[09:03:23] <delinquentme> Andy1991, so its just {} ??
[09:03:28] <Andy1991> Yeah
[09:04:00] <Andy1991> $('#{selector}', { selector: 'container' }) = $('#container')
[09:04:34] <Andy1991> Then arrays is %1, %2 = element1/element2...
[09:04:57] <fission6> anyone here use jquery animation with google maps, can't get the map to properly render after toggleSlide
[09:05:17] <Andy1991> i.e. $('.%1-%2', ['find', 'me']) - $('.find-me')
[09:06:53] <Andy1991_> Damn chrome is buggy lately
[09:07:19] <hlve> chrome is silly.
[09:07:21] <hlve> Firefox 4 lyf
[09:07:39] <Andy1991> Nah, Chrome all the way
[09:07:44] <Andy1991> Even with bugs
[09:07:48] <hlve> Eh
[09:07:50] <hlve> I don't like chrome
[09:07:50] <woopwoop> prolly really silly, but I can't figure out the right syxtax to retreive the id attr http://jsfiddle.net/NLCTY/
[09:08:30] <BillCriswell> woopwoop: You probably don't want to use numeric ids.
[09:08:40] <fission6> well i guess not haha
[09:08:48] <woopwoop> i have to for this damn asp.net project
[09:08:55] <jeffsmykil> Is there a good way to fake ajax responses sending back json data from a file on a dev machine?
[09:09:23] <woopwoop> but let's say it wasn't in an id
[09:09:33] <woopwoop> instead of ticket it'd say the id #
[09:09:36] <woopwoop> how would i access that
[09:09:44] <jeffsmykil> woopwoop: if you are doing asp.net and using the dynamic ids i feel bad for you
[09:09:52] <Andy1991> lol
[09:09:57] <woopwoop> lol
[09:10:00] <BillCriswell> woopwoop: You want closest(), not .parent() by the way.
[09:10:07] <woopwoop> it's a ticket system in a grid
[09:10:31] <BillCriswell> .parents() could also work, just not .parent()
[09:10:32] <jeffsmykil> probably using data grids?
[09:10:32] <jeffsmykil> fucking nightmare
[09:10:32] <jeffsmykil> been there done that
[09:10:39] <woopwoop> yep.
[09:10:41] <woopwoop> kendoui too
[09:10:46] <Andy1991> I'm off, thanks for the help
[09:11:19] <woopwoop> closest worked
[09:11:21] <woopwoop> thanks guys
[09:11:31] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:12:03] <Drager> Do this code look alright to you guys? https://pastee.org/vk5kn
[09:12:52] <shoky> Drager: yea
[09:13:47] <Drager> shoky: Any idea if there's a better way of doing it than using the this.next?
[09:13:57] <shoky> Drager: of doing what?
[09:15:40] <Drager> shoky: I mean like, that the next is prone to break
[09:16:11] <shoky> Drager: there's no better way to get the next element.. if there is something better to identify the element you want, then use the something better, obviously.
[09:16:51] <Drager> shoky: Ah, thanks
[09:16:53] <shoky> by better, i mean.. less prone to break
[09:17:30] <shoky> Drager: for example if you know it's always gonna be a sibling with a certain class.. you can do .siblings('.theClass')
[09:17:52] <shoky> but uh.. cant really help with that without knowing more
[09:19:24] <Drager> shoky: Yeah, I did that
[09:19:35] <Drager> and I believe it's better
[09:19:39] <Drager> So thank you
[09:19:45] <bil`> So I used .map() to generate an array of object literals, but I guess when you use map it makes the array a jQuery object. Is there anything I can run to strip it down to a normal array so I run JSON.stringify() on it?
[09:20:00] <shoky> bil`:  .get()
[09:20:09] <bil`> the api doc mentions using get on top of map, but it still seems to be a jQ object
[09:20:11] <shoky> bil`: and there's also $.map which returns a normal array
[09:20:26] <shoky> bil`: nuh.. .get() is a normal array
[09:21:27] <Chris_CC> Hi guys .. quick problem ... having trouble with lines .48 .49 OR .53 .54 firing when firing an if statement using the (data) .. any idea why? http://pastebin.com/TenmWy5m
[09:22:57] <shoky> Chris_CC: what?
[09:23:06] <shoky> what's the trouble
[09:23:14] <ralphsaunders> This is a bit odd. Why does this code cause freezing/crashing. I think I might be misunderstanding how clearTimeout() works (line 19). http://pastie.org/5507323
[09:23:58] <Chris_CC> shoky: 1 sec i'l get what works and what doesnt
[09:25:03] <shoky> ralphsaunders: why are you calling functions in Plugin.prototype  ?
[09:25:12] <shoky> ralphsaunders: with no context
[09:25:22] <ralphsaunders> shoky: instead of this.moveSlides?
[09:25:45] <Chris_CC> shoky: here are the 2 versions .. the 2nd works but does not rely on (data) being returned http://pastebin.com/XzhwWrav
[09:26:09] <Chris_CC> basically i want a button to change text from FOLLOW -> UNFOLLOW (or vise versa) if the .php page returns good
[09:26:17] <shoky> ralphsaunders: the call to .timeout is more suspicious to me, because timeout() actuall does something with 'this'
[09:26:21] <ralphsaunders> shoky: this.moveSlides() (line 7) would be referring to the delegate method the blocks in. Is there a better way?
[09:26:45] <ralphsaunders> Ah
[09:28:10] <shoky> ralphsaunders: also.. inside the setTimeout, you're calling timeout() with the same 'id' that you got before
[09:28:27] <bil`> shoky: yeah you were right about get my bad
[09:28:27] <shoky> ralphsaunders: so it'll keep doing  clearTimeout on the original id, i think
[09:28:36] <ralphsaunders> ah
[09:28:45] <aqeel> a?b:c; what is this called ...how to search for this on net
[09:28:52] <bil`> Can you do any cool stuff by leaving the array a query object? what stye point?
[09:28:58] <bil`> jquery*
[09:29:30] <shoky> aqeel: ternary conditional
[09:29:37] <aqeel> thanks
[09:30:34] <fission6> how do i get html() and include the html of the element vs just everything "in" it
[09:31:25] <shoky> bil`: cool stuff? it's an array of object literals.. jquery is for DOM manipulation and AJAX  ;]
[09:31:40] <misteroneill> fission6: you mean the element itself minus its contents?
[09:31:50] <fission6> element itself and its contents
[09:32:14] <misteroneill> ah. well i can't think of a way off the top of my head, but if you want to copy something you can always use .clone()
[09:32:15] <ralphsaunders> shoky: aha, atleast I have an error in the console now (call stack size exceeded), thanks :)
[09:32:33] <fission6> outHTML seems tow irk in normal dom
[09:32:43] <shoky> fission6: either .parent().html()  or $('<div>').append(theElement).html()   or if you dont care about firefox<11 then .prop('outerHTML')
[09:32:54] <misteroneill> yeah you can just use that too
[09:33:50] <bil`> shoky: I mean why does't .map automatically return it in the format of when you attach get()? In what situation would I not want get applied too?
[09:34:27] <shoky> bil`: if you return other elements i guess. for example if you map over some divs to get their inner <input> or whatever
[09:34:52] <bil`> ah
[09:34:55] <bil`> gotcha
[09:35:43] <shoky> bil`: also this way you can easily chain more .map or .each or .filter
[09:35:58] <shoky> of course.. EC5 has all those already ;S
[09:44:16] <aqeel> very weird....i was trying to look for ternary error document on jslint and what there is nothing ...no explanation to this error
[09:47:04] <aqeel> any direction i can get help for this ternatory conditional topic
[09:51:25] <NoiseEee> aqeel: sorry whats the issue?
[09:52:12] <aqeel> no issue just reading up on ternary conditional stuff, ans am not being able to find  a good source
[09:52:50] <aqeel> jslint gives error on ternary operator and is not documented as well
[09:53:40] <thinboy> Anyone knows how to make an image slider swipable on touch devices?
[09:55:00] <softmanpetro> I get for a functional test dubious
[09:55:49] <NoiseEee> aqeel: jslint doesn't care about ternary, it cares about silly whitespace issues in ternary
[09:56:15] <aqeel> Use the || operator.                  x: (document.all ? (!de.scrollLeft ? b.scrollLeft : de.scrollLeft) : (window.pageXOffset ? window.pageXOffset : window.scrollX))
[09:56:22] <aqeel> not really
[09:57:34] <NoiseEee> aqeel: anyone using code like that should be ternaries
[09:57:34] <NoiseEee> i mean terminated
[09:57:46] <NoiseEee> aqeel: totally unreadable, totally unnecessary
[09:58:02] <aqeel> yeah and worst of all it is in plugin
[09:58:45] <aqeel> even coldhead was puking at it
[09:59:11] <aqeel> so i am kind of rectifyting this plugin
[09:59:36] <NoiseEee> and your question is why does jslint complain?
[10:00:46] <aqeel> ni i want to read on the errors it gave
[10:00:51] <aqeel> no*
[10:01:05] <aqeel> there is no documentation on such error
[10:02:41] <aqeel> there is this another line
[10:02:41] <aqeel> var k = e.charCode ? e.charCode : e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which;
[10:06:07] <NoiseEee> you'd have to ask crockford or take it to some kind of jslint/hint support for the reason it complains
[10:06:07] <NoiseEee> maybe because "?"
[10:06:14] <NoiseEee> meaning "gross having more than one ? in a line"
[10:06:22] <sunbeam> $("li.current-item .item-content").animate({ display: "none"}, 500);
[10:06:35] <sunbeam> any idea what I do wrong here? the classes targeted are the right ones
[10:09:31] <aqeel> it says use || operator
[10:09:53] <aqeel> y: (document.all ? (b.scrollTop || de.scrollTop) : (window.pageYOffset || window.scrollY))
[10:09:58] <aqeel> this works..
[10:10:26] <aqeel> so does this
[10:10:27] <aqeel> var k = e.charCode || e.keyCode || e.which;
[10:12:43] <NoiseEee> aqeel: why are you caring so much about what jslint says
[10:13:25] <aqeel> well not just js lint but jshint, and jsfiddle jslint also same error
[10:15:41] <sealeaf1> Hi, does jquery checkbox:checked return an array?
[10:15:56] <sealeaf1> I'm trying to create an array of checked values that I can pass to the backend in rails
[10:16:43] <maplesoft> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13789428/any-other-way-of-basic-auth-else-than-browser-generated-input-text-fields
[10:16:47] <maplesoft> any tip?
[10:17:11] <halcyon1234> sealeaf1: You may need to do a .each.  var values = new array; $("selector:checked").each(function() { push value into array });
[10:17:46] <sealeaf1> halycon: Right. And then I would pass that as json, and rails would get it as an array?
[10:17:50] <aqeel> well do not use new array but....var values=[]
[10:18:39] <halcyon1234> aqeel: Yes, that. I suck at remembering syntax. =)
[10:23:13] <aqeel> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/hgNLm/
[10:23:19] <aqeel> this is the plugin
[10:23:55] <sealeaf1> https://gist.github.com/4252303 - could someone tell me what the .get() is doing there?
[10:27:18] <roswell> sealeaf1, it returns an array of matched objects i believe
[10:27:31] <roswell> entries, rather
[10:27:39] <sealeaf1> Doesn't the map part already create an array of checkbox values?
[10:29:57] <roswell> sealeaf1, map() returns a jquery array
[10:30:31] <sealeaf1> roswell: Ah, I see. and .get() turns that in a regular array?
[10:30:38] <roswell> sealeaf1, right
[10:30:56] <sealeaf1> roswell: thanks. If I passed that as json to a ruby backend, would it turn into a ruby array?
[10:32:03] <bensonshaji> hi guys, I want to animate each span elements in div, during the hover of a particular span the remaining must be blured. Does anyone know the solution or could you please redirect me to the right place....
[10:32:55] <roswell> sealeaf1, jquery simply passes json string inside a request. i'm not sure either ruby autodetects and decodes incoming json or not
[10:34:06] <sealeaf1> roswell: Okay, thanks.
[10:36:30] <roswell> bensonshaji, i guess it's $( 'div:not( #item-to-blur )' ).toggleClass( 'blur' ).animate( '1s' );
[10:36:30] <aqeel> bensonshaji: what u mean by blur?
[10:37:14] <sealeaf1> Hm, how would I make a regular delete request using jquery?
[10:37:18] <BillCriswell> I really think I need to take a class on basic excel. I have to write a script for anything I want to do that I know should be doable in Excel or Open Office quickly lol.
[10:37:22] <sealeaf1> Actually can't find it in the docs :(
[10:37:46] <aqeel> BillCriswell: macros?
[10:38:57] <aqeel> not basic but advance..., basic is GUI usage, intermediate is hidden stuff, and advance is intigration
[10:39:24] <aqeel> like vbscript and macros stuff
[10:39:30] <roswell> sealeaf1, was it rails?
[10:39:38] <sealeaf1> roswell: Yeah
[10:39:49] <sealeaf1> roswell: Er, maybe I shouldn't be using AJAX.
[10:40:07] <sealeaf1> I just need to get all checked checkbox values, make a delete request, and refresh the page.
[10:40:30] <lasha> why wouldn't ajax for that?
[10:40:33] <sealeaf1> If I make a delete request, are the checked checkbox values automatically available in params?
[10:40:47] <sealeaf1> I think a page refresh is better.
[10:40:54] <lasha> you can pass the checked box values through the query string/URL
[10:40:56] <roswell> sealeaf1, yup, if you pass these with $.ajax()
[10:41:03] <bensonshaji> roswell, hovered item should not be blurred but the remaining span elements should be . this is my general syntax <span><a></a></span>........<span><a></a></span>
[10:41:07] <aqeel> but the delete you can do client side and no need for ajax
[10:41:27] <sealeaf1> aqeel: I need to delete the users from the database.
[10:42:07] <bensonshaji> roswell, I was trying to achieve something like this without css3 http://www.htmldrive.net/items/demo/1152/CSS3-and-jQuery-Blur-Menu
[10:42:23] <aqeel> ok, i thought u need to check and unccheck the checkbox..
[10:42:37] <roswell> bensonshaji, gotcha
[10:44:40] <bensonshaji> roswell, Do  you know how it can be done with jquery?
[10:44:51] <chrisluther> howdy all.  Does anyone have any pointers on how to add HTML5 data-attributes to Drupal select list option arrays?
[10:45:23] <NoiseEee> chrisluther: #drupal
[10:45:37] <roswell> bensonshaji, it's 5 minutes
[10:46:03] <bensonshaji> roswell, ok
[10:46:34] <katsh> ok so. http://jsfiddle.net/KepeX/3/  how to get include <div id='one'>..</div> when i use html() ?
[10:46:45] <katsh> I can't use parent() because that gets the 'root'
[10:47:06] <dshiner> anybody know a quick fix for being unable to click on anything after a dialog is displayed and closed? google didnt help.
[10:47:10] <Rchristiani> Is it possible to add multiple attributes to an element with the attr method, catch is that the attributes would be like this "addthis:url" etc
[10:48:21] <roswell> dshiner, bring on a 100% div with outermost z-index
[10:49:50] <dshiner> roswell: what do you mean?
[10:50:52] <roswell> dshiner, simply add a "<div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; z-index: 999; display: none;"></div>"
[10:51:11] <eziob> i'm handling a submit and returning false.  chrome isn't keeping an auto select list .. anyone know why?
[10:51:21] <roswell> dshiner, and toggle its visibility whether you need an user's input to be blocked
[10:52:49] <dshiner> roswell, sorry, what i was saying is that i am unable to click on anything on the page after rendering and closing a modal dialog. it seems that jquery is capturing all of the clicks and returning false or something. i was to unblock the input to allow the page to function
[10:52:58] <dshiner> *want to unblock
[10:54:19] <roswell> dshiner, ah ok. then it must be that the same blocking div
[10:56:49] <hateIE> hey when i .load() something its triggering $(window).load i dont want that because I my check_logged_in() function lives there and then it ends up getting stuck in a loop
[11:00:19] <roswell> bensonshaji, http://roswellsite.ru/test/bensonshaji/
[11:00:27] <hateIE> i mean i can make a flag to check if the loggin has been checked .. and not allow it to go any further but isnt there some a little more elegant
[11:00:58] <NoiseEee> your check_logged_in() is js?
[11:01:09] <hateIE> yep
[11:01:26] <hateIE> it checks with $.ajax
[11:02:06] <bensonshaji> roswell, thanks a lot buddy, Its great work what you have done there. Once again thank you so much :)
[11:02:32] <roswell> bensonshaji, nm always glad to help
[11:02:49] <hateIE> then it uses ajaxComplete to check that all the ajax requests are complete
[11:02:57] <hateIE> then arranges the content accordingly
[11:03:44] <hateIE> but that is was it trigger the stuck in a loop because its calling .load() which is then triggering $(window).load(..)
[11:03:57] <hateIE> er
[11:04:38] <hateIE> but that is what is triggering it to be stuck in a loop because its calling .load() which is then triggering $(window).load(..) which calls the login_check again ....even
[11:05:26] <david`> http://plug.dj/deep-lounge-chill-house/ if anyone want to listen/play (deep, lounge and chill house only) :)
[11:05:27] <NoiseEee> hateIE: all sounds goofy, you should be using jquery/event listeners for your original window.load event
[11:06:00] <systemfault> Could you do that check on the backend?
[11:07:22] <roswell> david`, it doesn't play anything though
[11:07:38] <david`> roswell you need to login :-)
[11:07:46] <roswell> david`, f*ck that )
[11:07:59] <david`> roswell chill
[11:08:00] <hateIE> systemfault it is checking on the back .. with $ajax
[11:08:10] <eziob> can anyone reach http://206.248.142.234:52170/scan
[11:08:47] <NoiseEee> hateIE: but shouldn't it be checking before the page even renders?
[11:08:58] <NoiseEee> hateIE: your setup suggests I can fool your JS and be logged in
[11:09:15] <roswell> eziob, nope
[11:09:42] <hateIE> yeah you can but try and talk to the scripts they will tell you p off lol
[11:09:51] <hateIE> on the server side
[11:10:11] <NoiseEee> hateIE: yeah but i'd adjust your JS in my local browser and suggest to it that the XHR auth call was successful.
[11:10:42] <NoiseEee> hateIE: anyways, you should be using jquery/event listeners for your original window.load, and maybe change it to DOM ready to avoid being fired erroneously
[11:10:54] <roswell> david`, really, you have to let visitors to listen to a selected stream w/o any action required from their side, otherwise it sucks
[11:13:23] <eziob> roswell, can you try again?
[11:14:27] <roswell> eziob, it works fine now (either it's not, i'm not sure - gave me some html)
[11:14:50] <eziob> did the page fully render?
[11:15:22] <katsh> shoky: thanks
[11:15:41] <roswell> eziob, nope, though i have it in the telnet output heh... ok will give it a try with a browser
[11:15:45] <anew> http://pastebin.com/ZPD4cKs3 anyone using requirejs here?  if i have a callback in my define... where do i put the data that will be loaded into it now?
[11:15:58] <eziob> oh i assume it works then
[11:15:59] <eziob> cool
[11:16:30] <eziob> okay ... http://206.248.142.234:52170/scan ... can anyone tell me why chrome's autocomplete isn't working for the add host/range input?
[11:16:47] <roswell> eziob, it presented me with a couple of dropdowns
[11:17:01] <eziob> oops
[11:17:19] <eziob>  http://206.248.142.234:52170/scan?assessment_id=8
[11:18:54] <anew> anyoen ?
[11:19:05] <roswell> anew, it depends...
[11:20:21] <roelb> Hi all, question: I see the development team has a quite long list of test devices. But isn't it better to "crowdsource" these things? A kind of mobile site where users can go through all tests and give a rating on how "Natural" it felt. With these results, maybe a plugin can be built that optimizes functionality, transitions, css, ... for all devices?
[11:20:23] <roswell> eziob, i assume you're trying to filter out entries by entering their first letters into the input box under "Select Hosts/Ranges", but i can't see any network activity... yet i assume you rely on http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[11:20:36] <anew> roswell please look here http://pastebin.com/4D0a2X45  will data be loaded on page here where .... is now ?
[11:20:49] <eziob> roswell, nope i just want chrome's autocomplete to keep a list so that people don't have to type in the same ranges over and over
[11:21:25] <eziob> roswell, try 192.168.1.1-50
[11:21:47] <roswell> eziob, try adding autocomplete="on" to that input field's attributes
[11:22:38] <roswell> anew, do you use some framework? bootstrap?
[11:22:52] <anew> backbone
[11:23:17] <eziob> roswell, forgot to put return false back in there ... shouldn't be refreshing each time
[11:23:33] <roswell> anew, just asking since i can't remember #jquery 's got anything like "require( {} )"
[11:23:47] <anew> oh
[11:23:49] <eziob> roswell, that didn't work
[11:23:50] <anew> yeah nevermind then
[11:23:56] <anew> i'm using require.js and backbone.js
[11:24:52] <eziob>  http://206.248.142.234:52170/scan?assessment_id=8  <--- can anyone figure out why chrome isn't maintaining an auto complete list for add hosts/ranges .... try 192.168.1.1-50
[11:25:05] <roswell> eziob, afair data for autocompleting is saved for latter use only upon submission of a form
[11:25:21] <eziob> roswell, i'm causing a submission on the form
[11:25:31] <eziob> i just changed to be a form submission so that it would autocomplete
[11:25:41] <kerrick> Is this a fairly idiomatic usage: http://bpaste.net/show/YHP6paDjN9kYnJBQt8hg/
[11:25:44] <roswell> oh ok i'll recheck
[11:25:48] <kerrick> or should I be doing this some other way?
[11:26:56] <roswell> eziob, i'm out of ideas actually
[11:27:23] <eziob> roswell, thanks
[11:28:19] <roswell> eziob, but... what i'm saying is that a form shall be _submitted_, which i can't see on a chrome network activity
[11:28:50] <roswell> either let it be an iframe or an ajax
[11:28:57] <eziob> right i'm returning false for the submission ... the browser should think its submitted
[11:29:15] <roswell> actually the browser doesn't as you tell it not to
[11:30:02] <TelFiRE> Is something wrong with my syntax here? (I'm on 1.5 and can't use on())   $offer.live('click','a.round',(function(){ $(this).parents('.views-row').addClass('flip');  });
[11:30:41] <xec_> ?live @ TelFiRE
[11:30:43] <bot-t> TelFiRE, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:31:02] <xec_> TelFiRE: there is no selector argument to .live()
[11:31:37] <xec_> TelFiRE: so the "a.round" part doesnt make sense
[11:32:30] <TelFiRE> I see :/ so I just have to select all a.rounds and run a listener for each?
[11:33:08] <roswell> TelFiRE, jquery will create a listener for every item matched the selector, i. e. $( 'a.round' ).live( ... );
[11:33:14] <sethetter> TelFiRE: I believe you can delegate it still so it's just a listener on the encompassing parent element
[11:34:15] <TelFiRE> Yeah I know but it's usually less efficient if I'm not mistaken
[11:34:35] <sethetter> Efficient how?
[11:34:49] <sethetter> Performance wise I believe it's better because you have less event handlers flying around
[11:34:54] <TelFiRE> curses, why can't drupal keep up with jquery
[11:34:58] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: sethetter's suggestion is correct
[11:35:07] <TelFiRE> sorry sethetter I meant that at ros
[11:35:10] <roswell> TelFiRE, it shan't be bothering you unless you program a microcode, which i either doubt
[11:35:12] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: just manually figure out the class/if you care in the function
[11:35:27] <xec_> TelFiRE: you probably want delegate instead, see ?delefate
[11:35:31] <bot-t> TelFiRE, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:37:23] <TelFiRE> does delegate work like live?
[11:37:27] <TelFiRE> and work after ajax etc
[11:37:44] <xec_> yes
[11:37:56] <xec_> assuming the element you attach it to always exist
[11:38:30] <sethetter> If you want event handlers on dynamically loaded/created elements, you need delegate though I believe
[11:39:10] <ravenzz> TelFiRE anyway you should use on()
[11:40:05] <TelFiRE> ravenzz: that would be quite a trick
[11:40:23] <TelFiRE> I'm on 1.5
[11:40:28] <xec_> ravenzz: not available in 1.5
[11:40:53] <ravenzz> oh I didn't read it
[11:41:06] <ravenzz> sorry
[11:41:26] <ravenzz> that's insane anyway :p
[11:41:35] <TelFiRE> :p
[11:41:39] <TelFiRE> ok so what's wrong with this http://pastebin.com/wN8c9Fb1
[11:42:07] <TelFiRE> I'm still getting the same error, complaining about the syntax of a . somewhere on the 4th line of that paste.... regardless of delegate or live
[11:42:08] <ravenzz> why are you using 1.5?
[11:42:11] <TelFiRE> ravenzz: drupal
[11:42:17] <xec_> TelFiRE: selector goes 1st ;) read the docs
[11:42:30] <ravenzz> drupal what
[11:42:41] <TelFiRE> xec_: $offer is the selector
[11:42:53] <TelFiRE> $offer = $('#block-views-auction-offers-block').find('.views-row');
[11:43:08] <xec_> TelFiRE: no, 'a.round' is the selector
[11:43:14] <TelFiRE> oh whoops
[11:43:22] <ravenzz> you have a missing comma btw
[11:43:30] <ravenzz> 'a.roundback'f
[11:43:34] <ravenzz> function*
[11:43:37] <TelFiRE> AHHH
[11:43:39] <TelFiRE> that explains it
[11:43:40] <TelFiRE> thank you ravenzz
[11:43:51] <TelFiRE> why can't I see these things :(
[11:44:34] <ravenzz> and you should remove the parenthesis a.round',(function
[11:45:46] <TelFiRE> CRAP
[11:45:55] <TelFiRE> delegate is not working :( after ajax it dies
[11:46:59] <TelFiRE> ok I'm just going to select em all and use live I guess.. unless anyone has any tips
[11:47:21] <TelFiRE> because that seems to work. I worry about performance but don't think it will be too huge (I hope)
[11:47:28] <sethetter> TelFiRE: The way you should use delegate is to select a parent element that will surround any elements that will be added in the future that need the event handler
[11:47:48] <sethetter> And then provide a selector for the specific elements within that parent
[11:47:55] <TelFiRE> sethetter: that's what my $offer variable is
[11:48:40] <jacobroufa> http://rrstar.com/wishlist - i have a jquery ui dialog modal that is breaking in some older browsers here. can anyone give me any tips to fixing this?
[11:48:49] <TelFiRE> what I'm saying is, if I use delegate() then after ajax occurs, the clicks do not work any more
[11:49:04] <jacobroufa> closest i can get is debugger pushing me into some crazy minified script that i cannot understand
[11:49:49] <TelFiRE> thanks for all the tips guys :) I appreciate the help
[11:50:31] <ravenzz> TelFiRE you're welcome, post a link if you need further help
[11:51:28] <rindolf> Hi all. Does anyone know the answer for this question - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13791528/how-to-get-jqtree-to-read-the-initial-tree-from-the-htmls-source ?
[11:54:13] <sealeaf1> for jquery.click(function()) does the function receive an event object?
[11:54:38] <kripster> hey guys, is there anyone I can remove the default action and set the expand collapse to an accordian (http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/22/)??
[11:54:58] <rindolf> kripster: let me see.
[11:55:58] <Drager> How can I make this button change the value when it shows it should be "Hide" (you get waht I mean) http://jsfiddle.net/xuTCX/
[11:56:18] <kripster> thx rindolf
[11:56:31] <sethetter> TelFiRE: Is your $offer element getting replaced when the ajax runs?
[11:56:39] <rindolf> kripster: OK, I'm not a jQuery Mobile expert.
[11:56:53] <kripster> don't worry, neither am i lol
[11:57:10] <TelFiRE> sethetter: it's set when the document loads, but with live() it works
[11:57:17] <rindolf> Drager: just use .text("Foo")
[11:57:29] <TelFiRE> or maybe I have that wrong
[11:58:24] <rindolf> Drager: I have something similar here - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/ - feel free to steal the button's functionality.
[11:58:45] <rindolf> Drager: see the [Show] Button in the right pane.
[11:59:06] <rabx> Hi, I am trying to achieve the same goals as the OP found in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4230422/jquery-scale-pulsate?rq=1 except I've been trying to include this particular script in hover to no avail. On hover run the script, on mouse out finish the animation and stop
[11:59:43] <rindolf> Drager: ping.
[11:59:57] <Drager> rindolf: Will check that out in a min. Thank you
[12:00:05] <rindolf> Drager: you're welcome.
[12:02:45] <kripster> i suppose if there is a way to remove the default expand and collapse and set a clickable function to toggle the content of the radio buttons?
[12:05:38] <tigger1> shoky: Thanky you (better late than never)
[12:06:56] <ThJ> I have a playlist class I made that uses <table> and <tbody> to implement song entries with expandable/collapsible tabs, and I've made them Sortable/Draggable. You can also highlight (select) one or more songs. Is it somehow possible to make groups of such items draggable?
[12:07:29] <rabx> http://jsbin.com/ukuzan/1/edit arrow isn't moving
[12:11:49] <kripster> thought this would be something simple but I can't figure it out
[12:16:56] <anew> this probably sounds idiotic, but can you generate text inside <script> tags with js
[12:18:10] <rabx> I am new but this might point you in the right direction: take a look at text() or html()
[12:20:29] <anew> with templates
[12:21:58] <piklu> Can anyone suggest me a good UI, as Kendo UI
[12:22:47] <kripster> any ideas rindolf??
[12:22:52] <xec_> anew: should be possible. like rabx mentioned http://jsfiddle.net/aYkS6/
[12:23:21] <rindolf> kripster: let me see what your question was.
[12:23:58] <kripster>  hey guys, is there anyone I can remove the default action and set the expand collapse to an accordian (http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/22/)??
[12:24:00] <rindolf> kripster: ah, well, I'll have to research it.
[12:24:15] <rindolf> kripster: s/anyone/anyway/ # /me is a grammar nazi.
[12:24:43] <xec_> s/anyway/any way/
[12:24:52] <xec_> xD
[12:24:56] <kripster> lol
[12:25:01] <kripster> :{
[12:25:46] <anew> oh hmmm i see thx xec_
[12:25:48] <anew> and rabx
[12:25:56] <rindolf> xec_: right.
[12:26:21] <rindolf> kripster: hold on, I need to restart X (my desktop effects are FUBAR).
[12:27:39] <xec_> kripster: i'm not quite sure what you're asking tbh
[12:27:48] <xec_> kripster: what do you want it to do?
[12:29:47] <kripster> when i click on the name tab instead of collapsing expanding I want it to be like an accordian effect
[12:29:57] <kripster> instead of just dissappearing
[12:30:20] <xec_> you want it to animate (slide) up/down?
[12:30:32] <kripster> correctamondo
[12:31:11] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:31:14] <xec_> kripster: have you seen this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10438588/jquery-mobile-add-animation-to-collapsible-set
[12:31:15] <rindolf> kripster: hi.
[12:31:23] <rindolf> xec_++
[12:31:30] <kripster> welcome back
[12:32:04] <rabx> xec_ would you mind taking a look at this: http://jsbin.com/ukuzan/1/edit
[12:32:57] <xec_> rabx: have you tried including jquery? :D
[12:33:04] <rabx> :) yes
[12:33:19] <rabx> first time using jsbin
[12:33:24] <rabx> wasn't sure if i had to include it
[12:33:32] <xec_> http://jsbin.com/ukuzan/2/edit
[12:33:55] <rabx> wow... you're a genius... I did have to include it lol
[12:34:05] <xec_> there is also an "add library" button at the top
[12:34:16] <xec_> which does basically the same as i did
[12:34:26] <rabx> how can i get the hover off to finish the animation and pause at the beginning?
[12:34:44] <Jzarecta> hi I want to do a vanilla JQuery script, but I wonder if I can get the page title?
[12:35:10] <rindolf> Jzarecta: use $("title").text()
[12:35:23] <anew> http://pastebin.com/jLeHbf0d so how would you create the array after initFeedPage on the fly then ?
[12:35:24] <Jzarecta> rindolf ok thaks.
[12:35:30] <rindolf> Jzarecta: you're welcome.
[12:37:06] <xec_> rabx: not sure how you can make it finish the animation. .stop(true, true) will make it jump to end
[12:37:39] <xec_> rabx: this is quite easy with css animations though
[12:38:01] <hlve> be careful with CSS animations. You drop most IE support.
[12:38:34] <xec_> browser support is an issue, but even latest IE supports them
[12:39:04] <anew> anyone?
[12:39:16] <xec_> question is, how essential is the animation really :)
[12:41:10] <katsh> are if statements a good way to check if something happened?
[12:41:26] <katsh> $('body').append(toolbar)    would it be reliable to put that inside an if?
[12:43:01] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. i'm having some issues with jquery isotope and infinite scroll.. If anyone has any thoughts, they would be hugely appreciated. its kinda a mish mash of issues with jquery and wordpress... I am an experienced WP dev so I can work out most issues relating to WP
[12:43:10] <LindsayMac> http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/ <~~ example
[12:43:32] <LindsayMac> basically i'm not getting any errors, but i'm also not getting the rest of my posts
[12:43:45] <rabx> xec_ yea I see what you mean with stop(). Maybe I can use animate on the hover out to scale it back down to 150px. Haven't tried any animation in css yet
[12:44:04] <rindolf> katsh: why do you expect that statement to fail?
[12:44:54] <Jzarecta> rindolf: I need more coaching, so this is what I have, what I want is really JQuery to replace headers image depending on the title of the site doing a switch case (or if else).
[12:45:42] <Jzarecta> rindolf http://ooo.pastebin.ca/2291220
[12:47:02] <katsh> rindolf: I am not sure. it seems to work sometimes, and sometimes does not
[12:48:08] <Jzarecta> rindolf should it be a $("title").load(function() { if (this == "home") {   $("#header").css("background-image","url('"+ headimage[1] + "')"); } elseif...
[12:48:32] <rabx> xec_ this kinda works, isn't perfect: http://jsbin.com/ukuzan/4/edit
[12:49:01] <rabx> thanks for your help xec_
[12:49:38] <rindolf> Jzarecta: I'm not sure if this is the way to change the page title.
[12:50:10] <Jzarecta> rindolf I dont want to change the page title, I want to change the CSS based on the page title.
[12:50:41] <rindolf> Jzarecta: OK.
[12:50:51] <rindolf> Jzarecta: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7173596/changing-the-page-title-with-jquery - maybe see this.
[12:51:05] <Jzarecta> so if I am on 'home' load css #header background-image: url('mycar.jpg');
[12:51:26] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: as long as you're on one page, you should be adding/removing classes, not css files.
[12:51:49] <xec_> rabx: if you wanted to try css animations, check this out (firefox is the only one that supports non-vendor-prefix atm) http://jsbin.com/ukuzan/2/edit
[12:52:02] <xec_> IE10 should prob work too
[12:52:15] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee well I ws thinking onloading different CSS arguments.
[12:52:33] <Jzarecta> or loading a different array element
[12:53:21] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: i don't know what that means
[12:54:16] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee well let say I have something like this: var myHeaders=new Array("images/background1.png","images/background2.png","images/background3.png");
[12:54:31] <rabx> xec_ awesome. I will use this, thanks again
[12:55:56] <Jzarecta> and then if title = home -> css("background-image", "url('"+myHeaders[1]"')"
[12:56:15] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: whatever floats your boat; personally i'd keep all that stuff in the CSS as .background1, .background2 etc and then apply/remove classes.  not a fan of defining CSS elements in JS.
[12:56:56] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee oh ok I thought I was doign something impossible
[12:58:18] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee ok if I want to do it your way, how do I do it in JQuery?
[12:58:44] <NoiseEee> $(whatever).addClass('.userBackground');
[12:58:44] <NoiseEee> minus the .
[13:01:13] <awc737> can anyone please hint how I can "return result;" ONLY after the ajax finished? http://paste.laravel.com/d3b
[13:01:59] <NoiseEee> awc737: put it in the callback
[13:02:20] <NoiseEee> .done(function(data) { return result; })
[13:03:00] <awc737> NoiseEee: for some reason that doesn't work, it breaks the original ajaxValidation script, and refreshes the page
[13:03:03] <awc737> var rsAjaxValidation = window.ajaxValidation;
[13:03:19] <awc737> I am overriding another scripts validation function
[13:03:43] <NoiseEee> awc737: all of which are irrelevent to me for the most part.  if you want something to fire after XHR, you put it in the callback.
[13:04:10] <awc737> NoiseEee: ok but it breaks my script
[13:04:15] <awc737> I need a way to return a promise
[13:04:47] <rabx> xec_ still around? I copied the working poc from http://jsbin.com/ukuzan/4/edit to my site but it doesn't run at all. Guess I am over looking something: http://pastebin.com/C6QBvBpZ
[13:04:57] <NoiseEee> awc737: "breaks your script" = probably working with broken logic
[13:04:59] <awc737> or something, I'm not sure, but removing return result as the last line breaks the script, because it finishes BEFORE the ajax callback
[13:05:12] <NoiseEee> http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/ @ awc737
[13:05:40] <awc737> i'd like to return the customerLookup() function, which itself returns result
[13:05:50] <awc737> so the end of the script is returning result still, but waiting for it
[13:06:17] <NoiseEee> awc737: http://eng.wealthfront.com/2012/12/jquerydeferred-is-most-important-client.html?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email and callbacks; not sure what else there is to explain.
[13:06:49] <awc737> NoiseEee: its got something to do with my override, because I've successfully used callbacks and deferred
[13:07:07] <awc737> but does that override look accurate to you? or does it look like it might interfere with a promise / callback
[13:08:07] <xec_> rabx: yes. you need to put the script code at the bottom of the html, or wrap it in $(document).ready(function(){ ... })
[13:08:26] <rabx> got it, thanks!
[13:09:02] <rabx> perfect, works on my site... thanks again (and again)

[13:12:14] <hlve> !someone? :(
[13:13:17] <awc737> NoiseEee: I don't think you understood the problem. If I move return result; INSIDE the callbacks, the script finishes before the async request, and with no return, therefore breaking

[13:31:33] <anew> ok guys... how would you create this on the fly without an xhr request? ok... how would you create this on the fly without an xhr request ?
[13:31:33] <anew> <anew> http://pastebin.com/jLeHbf0d
[13:31:48] <anew> bah copy/paste fail lol
[13:31:52] <anew> well anyone know anyway
[13:32:32] <nerk> is that even jquery?
[13:33:00] <anew> requirejs
[13:34:01] <hateIE> bah you see all that the problem was,  the onAjaxComplete was calling recursively because the function that does the login Check was calling another function with more ajax calls which was trigger onAjaxComplete all over again ... pritty stupid really.. all I had to do was put a if (user_logged == 0) into the condition that would call the "setup_member_content()" function...  and no its not
[13:34:01] <hateIE> insecure the jelly is in the server, any client side fiddle is just fooling your self into a false sense of reality you are not actually logged in you can not perform any significant functions like changing any data on the server side as they are protected by session variables that are set when the user actually logs from $(form).submit()
[13:35:45] <nerk> where's the peanut butter?
[13:35:51] <nerk> and does that make the user, the bread?
[13:36:48] <peb7268> Hi guys / gals, I'm having some trouble firing a custom event and passing the correct data. I have a working behavior. Essentially when a drop down selection is made the ui updates and another selection set is loaded in. It an animated hierarchical selector essentially. I want to bind the event to a button click though and use a custom event to trigger it. When It fires though the correct data is not passed and my event is fired 13 times instead of 1 time. 
[13:36:48] <peb7268> someone check my syntax and let me know what I need to do to improve it pls? All the action happens in the doc ready http://pastebin.com/vVQjYnK0
[13:37:32] <hateIE> well i guess ... yeah jquery == is the bread
[13:37:50] <hateIE> or butter or peanut butter
[13:38:55] <hateIE> is the user is the sandwich eater?
[13:39:16] <BinaryKitten> peb7268 contxt.realm.parent().parent().parent().parent()  does that last parent have a class or id or is it a unique tag?
[13:39:29] <peb7268> yeah
[13:39:30] <peb7268> ID
[13:40:10] <BinaryKitten> i mean is it distinct and knowable prior to this?
[13:40:27] <hugo_moss> hello, i have a jquery promise variable that is set inside a conditional if else statement while being inside a promise.done() callback.  when the var is set i want to run a function $.when(promise).done( function(){...} ), but if i place this when after the if else statement, since its asynchronous, the when gets executed, because the promise callback inside the conditional has not been executed
[13:40:27] <hugo_moss> since its not done.  how would I do this without having callbacks all over the place, what would be the cleanest way to do this?
[13:41:59] <BinaryKitten> hugo_moss i'm lost
[13:42:03] <MistuhKurtz> hugo_moss, might help if you can set that up in a fiddle
[13:42:29] <BinaryKitten> peb7268
[13:42:32] <peb7268> Yes
[13:42:40] <peb7268> yes it is distinct thanks
[13:42:49] <BinaryKitten> peb7268 quick tips, don't double wrap
[13:42:59] <BinaryKitten> try to use .closest .. if possible
[13:43:02] <peb7268> what do you mean by double wrap
[13:43:19] <BinaryKitten> $('#' + $(something).attr('id')
[13:43:36] <BinaryKitten> there's no point double wrapping when you've got the item with the right id
[13:44:20] <peb7268> oh ok
[13:44:20] <anew> do you see cross-domain xhr requests in firebug ? or are those hidden /
[13:44:22] <BinaryKitten> peb7268 also $($('#' + contxt.choices[contxt.nextI])); is double wrapped and not needed as you only need the inner one
[13:44:37] <BinaryKitten> anew check your net tab
[13:44:47] <peb7268> I was trying to give the inner one jquery utils
[13:44:53] <peb7268> http://pastebin.com/21xqvt1Q
[13:44:59] <peb7268> thats my starter html
[13:45:08] <peb7268> are you familiar with jqtransform?
[13:45:10] <hugo_moss> ex. if( cond1 ) { $.when(somePromise).done( function(){ promise= func(); } ) }else { $.when(anotherPromise).done( function(){ promise= func2(); } ) } $.when( promise ).done(){ execute this; };
[13:45:30] <BinaryKitten> hugo_moss pastebin please .. not paste in channel
[13:45:33] <hugo_moss> promise is null when after if/else
[13:45:35] <peb7268> It takes a select and turns it into ul's and divs and such so it can be skinned
[13:45:42] <peb7268> Thats why I'm using that retarded code.
[13:45:50] <peb7268> Trying to traverse up so many levels and such
[13:46:02] <anew> binarykitten is there some other way to contact server other than xhr? or are all requests viewable in firebug ?
[13:46:18] <peb7268> anew, you can see them in firebug
[13:46:21] <BinaryKitten> pretty much every request is in the net tab
[13:46:23] <peb7268> whats your server side lang?
[13:46:33] <anew> php
[13:46:35] <BinaryKitten> if it's standard xhr then they might appear in the console
[13:46:45] <BinaryKitten> server lang doesn't really matter
[13:46:48] <peb7268> yeah whatever you echo in php you can see in the response tab in chrome
[13:46:50] <peb7268> or firebug
[13:47:07] <anew> but i mean are there other ways to talk to server other than xhr ?
[13:47:08] <peb7268> click the response and look at the response tab
[13:47:19] <joAnna> Hi. IDo you know any jquery plugiin to get a (resizeable) thumbnail of a (dynamic) page in order to include it in a slide?
[13:47:28] <BinaryKitten> anew hidden form, script link, img src
[13:47:49] <hateIE> nerk: peanut butter & jelly sandwich eater == the user, bread == the browser/css, peanut butter == jquery/js, jelly == protected php functions and data in the sql database ... lolz
[13:47:51] <BinaryKitten> (new Image).src = 'yourphpscript';
[13:47:54] <peb7268> Anyway, so BinarryKitten, so for a custom event do you still have my link handy?
[13:48:07] <anew> binarykitten all those create a new page load tho dont they
[13:48:33] <BinaryKitten> not entirely anew
[13:48:43] <BinaryKitten> it all depends on what your trying to achieve
[13:48:44] <BinaryKitten> and why
[13:48:44] <nerk> hateIE: somes feasible.. and is making me hungry
[13:48:52] <anew> binarykitten can i pm you
[13:48:55] <BinaryKitten> nope
[13:48:59] <anew> lol
[13:49:00] <BinaryKitten> please keep it to channel
[13:49:09] <anew> yeah dont want to post the link for everyone
[13:49:13] <joAnna> sure, we want to see those hands
[13:49:16] <BinaryKitten> don't need a link
[13:49:26] <BinaryKitten> just need an outline of what you're trying to achieve
[13:49:33] <otherj> why would you ask a question in the public jquery channel if you don't want to let anyone else learn?
[13:49:42] <otherj> you should pay someone to help you if that's how you operate
[13:49:59] <peb7268> ok 1 sec
[13:50:00] <anew> yeah u do... this page i swear is not sending an xhr request... it is useing require.js and backbone.js
[13:50:12] <anew> and generating new data from database inside <script> tags
[13:50:19] <anew> and they are not using underscore.js templating either
[13:50:24] <anew> just so strange
[13:50:42] <peb7268> http://imgur.com/gkSXY
[13:51:46] <BinaryKitten> peb7268 sorry not sure what you want now.. you asked for a syntax check..
[13:51:50] <peb7268> When you select an element from the drop down, the select animates left and disappears, then a new one fades in. The text above updates and new options are shown. I have 3 levels of this.
[13:52:00] <peb7268> Yes. Im not sure what I'm doing wrong.
[13:52:15] <BinaryKitten> nor do i
[13:52:26] <BinaryKitten> but i've given you some pointers in regards to syntax
[13:53:04] <peb7268> Ok a condensed question:  this is the on signature //.on( events [, selector] [, data], handler(eventObject) )
[13:53:22] <anew> hidden form/script link/img src would not be asynchronous calls tho
[13:53:48] <BinaryKitten> they would be anew
[13:53:55] <peb7268> Nvm, ill just go try and figure it out.
[13:53:57] <anew> iframe?
[13:54:07] <BinaryKitten> iframe adds more complexity
[13:54:17] <anew> but i mean how are these asynch
[13:54:19] <anew> script link?
[13:54:22] <anew> i'm googling but failing
[13:54:37] <joAnna> please...  Do you know any way of getingt a (resizeable) thumbnail of a (dynamic) page in order to include it in a slide?
[13:54:49] <BinaryKitten> anew again what is you're after
[13:55:14] <anew> binarykitten http://pastebin.com/jLeHbf0d this needs to be generated asynch with no xhr call
[13:55:16] <anew> how is that possible
[13:55:58] <BinaryKitten> urm
[13:56:40] <BinaryKitten> i havent the foggiest anew mainly because i don't know how it's being generated at the moment
[13:56:53] <BinaryKitten> also don't know where the other parts are coming from
[13:56:57] <anew> what do you mean being generated at the moment
[13:57:09] <BinaryKitten> well how is it placed into the page?
[13:57:11] <anew> that's it... just the require inside the <script>
[13:57:32] <BinaryKitten> right i understand requireJs
[13:57:43] <BinaryKitten> but you must be generating the other parts for the function
[13:57:59] <BinaryKitten> even if that's "by hand in the html"
[13:58:26] <anew> i dont follow, the other parts of the function dont have anything to do with it ?
[13:58:45] <anew> i need to generate what is inside initFeedPage - it's just data from db
[13:58:53] <BinaryKitten> ok
[13:58:57] <anew> yeah
[13:58:57] <BinaryKitten> that i get,
[13:59:12] <anew> ok
[13:59:14] <BinaryKitten> but how are you going to do so. forget requesting via xhr or anything like that
[13:59:25] <BinaryKitten> how would you do it normally
[13:59:28] <anew> how? that's my question lol
[13:59:36] <BinaryKitten> how is it done for that script tag?
[13:59:40] <anew> well php fail bc we dont want a page load
[13:59:46] <anew> and xhr fail because we dont want xhr
[13:59:51] <anew> just wondering if there is a different way to get that
[14:00:02] <BinaryKitten> anew you're using requireJS
[14:00:05] <anew> what do u mean how is it done for script tag ?
[14:00:06] <BinaryKitten> just call it
[14:00:13] <anew> but it's not static ?
[14:00:44] * BinaryKitten has no clue what you want any more... but you pastebinned a script tag. how was that gneerated?
[14:01:21] <anew> yes - i want to generate this script tag
[14:01:24] <anew> it's not on the page
[14:01:36] <BinaryKitten> so what's the function?
[14:01:36] <anew> lol makes no sense almost
[14:02:03] <BinaryKitten> and what denotes the requirement
[14:02:12] <BinaryKitten> and why does it need to be a script tag?
[14:02:22] <anew> ok, dunno having hard time to explain
[14:02:27] <hateIE> nerk .. i find that rather amusing .. the user/eater who trys to eat the sandwich by fiddling on the client side just gets a straight peanut butter sandwich.. and because the server knows hes not allowed jelly if he trys to take any of the jelly he can be redirected to a naughty boy page.html
[14:02:48] <anew> ok so i have a define for require
[14:02:54] <anew> and that define accepts the data from db
[14:03:03] <anew> this is inside another .js file
[14:03:17] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:03:19] <anew> so when it recieves this data, it displays on page the products
[14:03:25] <anew> the issue is feeding this function the data
[14:03:32] <anew> i feed the function the data with this pastebin i just showed u
[14:03:46] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:03:55] <anew> now the problem - how do i create this pastebin onpage so i can feed it to the function
[14:04:01] <anew> on the fly
[14:04:07] <BinaryKitten> you don't create the script tag
[14:04:12] <BinaryKitten> you just run that code
[14:04:25] <BinaryKitten> but you shouldn't need to do the paths bit
[14:04:28] <anew> i.e. user clicks a button like 'all blue items', everyting inside the script changes
[14:04:32] <nerk> hateIE: lol, nice analogies
[14:04:41] <anew> 'just run that code' - what do u mean ?
[14:05:08] <BinaryKitten> anew in the onclick handler
[14:05:11] <BinaryKitten> call the require code
[14:05:13] <joAnna> :(
[14:05:42] <anew> meh, so then ur saying screw the whole require thing right
[14:06:13] <hateIE> goto love ajax :)
[14:06:15] <BinaryKitten> sorry joAnna there isnt a way to get a resizable image magically. You needto get the largest version and use that in a width/height limited fashion
[14:06:24] <BinaryKitten> anew NO
[14:06:33] <BinaryKitten> i'm saying USE the requre IN the click
[14:06:42] <anew> hmmm
[14:06:55] <BinaryKitten> just call the code. just call require directly at that point
[14:07:11] <BinaryKitten> there is nothing that says you have to have the require code in a separate script tag
[14:07:32] <BinaryKitten> in fact they say for cross linking scripts to use require inline
[14:07:32] <anew> true
[14:07:39] <anew> hmmm let me see
[14:07:54] <BinaryKitten> so you could create the object outside the require
[14:07:54] <anew> thanks
[14:07:56] <anew> for the talk
[14:08:00] <BinaryKitten> and then call it inside
[14:08:41] <joAnna> BinaryKitten, Thank you. Doesn't need to be resizable. I'm preety sure i'll handle the size after learning a way of getting the thumb. The main idea, i mean, my concern, is how to get a thumb of a page.
[14:09:05] <BinaryKitten> joAnna you'll need to use an external service for that
[14:09:14] <joAnna> BinaryKitten, probably with PHP tho...
[14:09:25] <BinaryKitten> doesn't have to be PHP
[14:09:31] <BinaryKitten> can be any server side stuff
[14:09:34] <joAnna> BinaryKitten, Thanks so much!
[14:11:19] <anew> wait so binarykitten back to the original question - if i do all that, will that create an xhr request or not ?
[14:12:02] <BinaryKitten> anew i don't know
[14:12:08] <BinaryKitten> and really it shouldn't matter
[14:12:27] <BinaryKitten> anew this is what i had in mind http://pastebin.com/MtVcKH8u
[14:13:32] <anew> right but then i have to get var data from somewhere (ajax)
[14:14:03] <BinaryKitten> that was my question
[14:14:14] <anew> ok
[14:14:15] <BinaryKitten> where is that data coming from or expected to come from
[14:14:22] <anew> yeah ... from server
[14:14:43] <BinaryKitten> if that different on every click?
[14:14:51] <BinaryKitten> *is that
[14:15:32] <anew> yep
[14:15:36] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:15:48] <BinaryKitten> so what are the items that triggering the click?
[14:16:04] <anew> color/price/etc
[14:16:13] <BinaryKitten> yeah but what are they
[14:16:24] <anew> 'what' = ?
[14:16:27] <anew> what do u mean
[14:16:32] <BinaryKitten> tag something..
[14:16:36] <BinaryKitten> you have to click on something..
[14:16:39] <BinaryKitten> what is that something
[14:16:43] <anew> oh
[14:16:46] <anew> yeah button
[14:16:51] <BinaryKitten> <button?>
[14:17:11] <BinaryKitten> and how are they rendered to the page?
[14:17:34] <anew> no actually <li>
[14:17:37] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:17:39] <BinaryKitten> and how are they rendered to the page?
[14:17:59] <anew> irrelevant tho... i swear i was looking at a page earlier that was doing something similar and there were no xhr requests in console/firebug
[14:18:04] <anew> that is what's making me mad
[14:18:09] <anew> mad = insane
[14:19:23] <BinaryKitten> anew ok
[14:19:33] <hateIE> in chrome you can right click the console and click on log XMLhttprequests
[14:19:38] <BinaryKitten> well if you think my questions are irrelevent, i'll go help someone else
[14:19:48] <hlve> BinaryKitten, I like you.
[14:19:51] <anew> yeah i had that option clicked hateie
[14:19:59] <BinaryKitten> otherwise anew please answer the question
[14:20:03] <anew> well i dont think ur questions are irrelevent just thought we were going off topic
[14:20:10] <anew> how are they rendered? what do you want to know exactly
[14:20:22] <BinaryKitten> how are you generating the different lis
[14:20:39] <BinaryKitten> you have to have somewhere that spits them out in the right order
[14:21:47] <ThJ> If you select into a single-row variable inside a PL/PGSQL, will GET DIAGNOSTICS still return the proper total row count? I'm basically sampling the first row of a result, but I need to know the total number of matched rows.
[14:22:03] <BinaryKitten> ThJ wrong channel
[14:22:09] <ThJ> Oh I'm sorry
[14:22:18] <ThJ> I'm so used to only hanging out on #postgres, lol
[14:22:24] <BinaryKitten> lol
[14:23:22] <anew> wait, you can add new script tags with require and download everything
[14:23:25] <anew> this will not show up in xhr
[14:23:46] <BinaryKitten> anew but that still won't give you the data
[14:23:59] <anew> when you call require/define you parse in your dependency list, which gets resolved, ie everything downloaded, then once everything has finished the parsed callback is resolved
[14:24:20] <CapMax> trying to get the option of a select box: jQuery('#<?php $widget_id ?>_category option[value=="'+id+'"]')
[14:24:32] <CapMax> is there any problem with that? assuming id is the value
[14:24:45] <BillCriswell> CapMax: just one =.
[14:24:49] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:24:58] <BinaryKitten> well i'm out ... need to go fix a laptop
[14:25:12] <anew> k
[14:25:13] <anew> thx
[14:25:31] <CapMax> BillCriswell: still returns null :(
[14:26:03] <MistuhKurtz> CapMax, try to avoid using PHP in your js if possible
[14:26:13] <CapMax> its unpossible
[14:26:25] <BillCriswell> CapMax: is the value attribute actually id or are you trying to comparse the text ?
[14:26:28] <BillCriswell> compare*
[14:26:33] <hateIE> anew are you basically trying to include a generated script.. ?
[14:26:34] <BillCriswell> comparse might be a real word?
[14:26:38] <BillCriswell> I need sleep.
[14:26:49] <CapMax> BillCriswell: the goal is actually to get the inner HTML of the options tag
[14:27:06] <MistuhKurtz> I'll accept that might be the case. I've just had to deal with the two intermingled before when it was possible to prevent, and it made for a real PITA to maintain
[14:27:14] <anew> hateie yes but the data inside it is dynamic
[14:27:38] <CapMax> on that note
[14:27:59] <BillCriswell> You'd want jQuery('#<?php $widget_id ?>_category option:contains('+id+')')
[14:28:08] <hateIE> so the server pukes out this script to some place with the dynamic variables from a database or something?
[14:28:11] <CapMax> ah wait i forgot the echo in php
[14:28:32] <CapMax> BillCriswell: is that a new way of doing it ? or what
[14:28:34] <hateIE> jquery has a funciton that will load a script from the server and append it to the <head> and I am sure it generates a xhr
[14:28:41] <BillCriswell> CapMax: that's why avoiding showing the php is good.
[14:28:41] <anew> well not the server tho
[14:28:46] <anew> it's all client side
[14:29:15] <BillCriswell> CapMax: That's if you want to get the text inside the option tag. I'm not sure if the [value=] would grab the text inside the <option>.
[14:29:21] <hateIE> what about eval()
[14:29:36] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. having some issues with masonry and infinite scroll and wondering if anyone can help. I am using posts pulled by wordpress and I have my selectors all set but for some reason infinite scroll isn't seeing the rest of my posts http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[14:29:59] <BillCriswell> If you have <option value="some_id">Foo</option> you can do $('#foo_category option[value=some_id]')
[14:30:08] <CapMax> oic
[14:30:09] <CapMax> ty
[14:30:13] <BillCriswell> Welcoem.
[14:31:39] <hugo_moss> whats the consequence of having $.when after an if else, if the $.when depends on a deferred callback inside the if else?
[14:31:50] <hateIE> anew:  you can generate the script code send it via ajax make the server store it into /js/ directory then use jquery to load it from there
[14:32:43] <anew> hmmm
[14:32:51] <anew> generate the script code
[14:32:55] <anew> with php
[14:33:01] <anew> send it ajax
[14:33:07] <anew> store it
[14:33:13] <shoky> hugo_moss: can you give an example
[14:33:14] <anew> then retrieve it
[14:33:16] <anew> is that right
[14:35:25] <BD--> http://jsfiddle.net/XedDB/3/ -> why do my resize handles all have a height of 0 and float in the top left of my div ? :(
[14:36:44] <shoky> BD--: you're not including jquery UI
[14:38:02] <LindsayMac> anyone with the infinite scroll help?
[14:38:42] <anew> ok so a new question XD can i print json that has <script> tags?
[14:38:49] <BD--> that seems to be a jsfiddle issue :x
[14:38:59] <BD--> it's the same when i add it: http://jsfiddle.net/XedDB/4/
[14:39:04] <shoky> BD--: you can add resources on the left side..
[14:39:10] <BillCriswell> anew: I don't see why not.
[14:39:26] <shoky> BD--: in that last fiddle you're still not including jquery-ui CSS file
[14:39:29] <anew> ok screw it i'll do i that way
[14:39:38] <shoky> BD--: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/XedDB/5/
[14:39:48] <anew> "screw it we'll do it live!"
[14:40:25] <BD--> strange, but thanks :)
[14:41:45] <BD--> that's a bummer though, because i get the exact same behavior in my project, and jquery-ui *is* included there :x
[14:42:10] <shoky> and the css?
[14:43:38] <BD--> yea :/
[14:43:53] <LindsayMac> I'm using this WP pluygin but have tried both the WP plugin and including it manually and neither seem to work correctly http://www.infinite-scroll.com/installation/
[14:44:11] <shoky> BD-- any errors in your console?
[14:44:38] <shoky> or got a live link?
[14:44:48] <LindsayMac> shoky: http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[14:44:56] <LindsayMac> or were you not asking me?
[14:45:07] <shoky> heh i wasn't. but i'll take a look anyways
[14:45:13] <LindsayMac> hahah sorry!
[14:45:18] <shoky> not that i know wordpress/infinte-scroll/masonry
[14:45:40] <LindsayMac> well the wordpress part I know pretty darn well.. its the javascripting that has me lost
[15:01:42] <BD--> no errors in console
[15:06:42] <BD--> shoky: do you see any obvious errors ? -> https://gist.github.com/a36788cedb1e48cfdb0e
[15:08:49] <BD--> screenshot of the result: http://tinypic.com/r/6zuixu/6
[15:12:59] <shoky> BD-- looks fine
[15:14:15] <jtm> shoky Thanks again for the other day!
[15:14:26] <shoky> yw jtm
[15:16:48] <shoky> BD-- are you sure jquery-ui.css is included properly?
[15:20:37] <BD--> i'm not sure of anything :') i'm seeing something strange in my head section :x
[15:22:47] <BD--> http://i50.tinypic.com/5yyicx.jpg
[15:23:25] <BD--> but apart from that, no, it links fine when i navigate towards it. besides, the 'draggable' part works fine :x
[15:25:11] <BD--> facebook is totally down here :o
[15:25:35] <Foxhoundz> Facebook is working
[15:25:36] <Foxhoundz> for m
[15:25:37] <Foxhoundz> ee
[15:31:31] <anew> lol was just about to ask if fb was down for anyone
[15:31:51] <LindsayMac> yep
[15:32:00] <LindsayMac> the world is ending
[15:32:03] <LindsayMac> duh
[15:32:08] <coldhead> OMG WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
[15:33:37] <LindsayMac> go out and do shit...
[15:33:44] <LindsayMac> the world is going to end in a week or so anyways
[15:36:33] <tw2113> no comment
[15:38:11] <LindsayMac> gmail was down earlier too
[15:38:57] <tw2113> facebook being down is a productivity gain
[15:54:16] <awc737> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'submit' of object #<HTMLFormElement> is not a function
[15:54:22] <awc737> the input is as such: <input type="submit" value="Register" name="form[submit]" id="submit" class="rsform-submit-button">
[15:56:17] <jacoluta> what are you trying to do>
[15:56:41] <shoky> awc737: it's because of the id="submit"
[15:57:03] <jacoluta> and it should be $('form').submit()
[15:57:06] <shoky> awc737: it overrides the .submit property/method
[15:57:12] <jacoluta> not $('input').submit()
[15:57:18] <shoky> he's doing it fine
[15:57:22] <shoky> it's the id="submit"
[15:57:23] <awc737> shoky: so id should not = submit?
[15:57:29] <shoky> awc737: yep
[15:57:55] <shoky> name="submit" or id="submit" are problematic
[15:58:07] <awc737> is it form.submit()... jQuery('#formRegister').submit();
[15:58:16] <awc737> I thought they were necessary?
[15:58:27] <shoky> what?
[15:58:47] <awc737> welel jacoluta said not $('input').submit(), but it's not, its jQuery('#formRegister').submit();
[15:58:54] <shoky> yeah, that's fine
[15:59:14] <shoky> he thought you're doing $('input').submit() because you showed the <input> element
[15:59:14] <luckyruby> should I be using event.preventDefault or return false for a click event handler to a link?
[15:59:19] <awc737> how does jquery know which is the submit button, if name and id !='submit'
[15:59:32] <shoky> awc737: type="submit"
[15:59:40] <awc737> oh
[16:00:25] <shoky> anyway jquery doesn't need to know it, it's the browser
[16:00:57] <awc737> sweet!!! it worked, thanks
[16:01:05] <shoky> ;]
[16:01:58] <shoky> luckyruby: event.preventDefault() is fine

[16:15:30] <asterismo> hi people
[16:15:33] <asterismo> i need hepl
[16:15:35] <asterismo> help
[16:16:07] <asterismo>  i need to have sections of the image highlighted in color on mouse over
[16:16:15] <coldhead> skypce: http://jsfiddle.net/8gNHg/
[16:16:23] <asterismo> does anybody knows how to do this?
[16:16:28] <asterismo> there are some howtos using jQuery and javascript but i cannot do it
[16:16:42] <asterismo> it is a -bw image with sections in it
[16:16:55] <ogk1000> if I have about 10 of these that only the # changes... any suggestions on the best way to write it? http://collabedit.com/2wqax
[16:17:04] <coldhead> you can't manipulate internal parts of an image with jQuery
[16:17:19] <coldhead> you just get the whole image, not pixel level within it
[16:17:34] <ogk1000> coldhead, you mind peeping my link?
[16:18:50] <skypce> very thank you coldhead i will test it now
[16:19:58] <asterismo> coldhead, this would be fine, but i cannot do it
[16:19:59] <asterismo> http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/demo_simple.html
[16:21:27] <asterismo> or how about mapping an image in sections, and on mouseover, the whole image changes to anotherone with the highlighted colors?
[16:21:48] <asterismo> is there any example on doing that?
[16:22:24] <asterismo> preloading images and switching them on mouse over different sections
[16:22:32] <asterismo> can anyone help me with this?
[16:25:04] <shoky> damn u Fatty
[16:25:18] <ogk1000> hes helping lol u fkn it up
[16:25:59] <coldhead> collab chat sucks dogs balls
[16:26:08] <ogk1000> it does ya fk :/
[16:26:14] <coldhead> what's in there now should work, ogk1000
[16:26:22] <ogk1000> LMC thx
[16:26:22] <coldhead> see if you can follow the code
[16:26:30] <coldhead> it uses a regex to find the target id
[16:26:40] <ogk1000> giving me syntax error on regex line
[16:27:17] <coldhead> fixed
[16:27:24] <coldhead> there was a ( where there should be a )
[16:27:39] <coldhead> because some ass monkey kept typing chat in the code
[16:27:41] <coldhead> i killee
[16:27:50] <coldhead> man that collabedit sure angries up the blood
[16:28:09] <ogk1000> lol ya I think it needs to be only 2 ppl
[16:28:21] <shoky> i think  id should be target in that last line
[16:28:22] <ogk1000> what u did isnt working but ill faux with it
[16:28:25] <shoky> changed ;D
[16:28:31] <shoky> or
[16:28:39] <shoky> target[0] or somh
[16:28:41] <ogk1000> ahhh
[16:28:43] <ogk1000> it worked ya
[16:28:47] <ogk1000> what is this fadeToggle thing?
[16:28:52] <shoky> ?fadeToggle
[16:28:52] <bot-t> .fadeToggle([duration], [easing], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[16:29:07] <ogk1000> so it changes hover to only need 1 function?
[16:29:15] <shoky> sorry Fatty
[16:29:38] <shoky> using .hover with only one callback, hmm
[16:29:43] <shoky> coldhead^
[16:29:50] <ogk1000> its working tho perf
[16:29:57] <coldhead> hover with only one fn calls that fn for mousein and mouseout
[16:30:03] <shoky> really
[16:30:06] <shoky> neat
[16:30:09] <coldhead> and fadeToggle does the honourable thing
[16:30:09] <ogk1000> coldhead, you made me warm and fuzzy with this
[16:30:31] <ogk1000> can I ask another Q very similar?
[16:30:41] <coldhead> as long as you don't use collabedit
[16:30:59] <ogk1000> so thats on the hover.... on the click of #abtn# I want it to addClass('active') on #btn#
[16:32:00] <ogk1000> o wait I think im silly
[16:32:31] <ogk1000>         $('#' + target).addClass('active');
[16:32:44] <ogk1000> thats adding the class to the #btn and #abtn... not that it matters but should only be #btn
[16:33:00] <ogk1000> does
[16:33:00] <ogk1000>         var target = id.match(/(btn\d+)/)[0]; search the entire dom?
[16:33:09] <goddard> how can do something with a span is clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/GgyZL/1/
[16:33:13] <goddard> here is an example
[16:33:22] <coldhead> ?jsfiddle @ ogk1000
[16:33:23] <bot-t> ogk1000, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[16:33:34] <coldhead> live demos ftw
[16:33:38] <shoky> goddard: just like you did, but you need to include jquery
[16:33:47] <ogk1000> ya only prob mine has so much extra local images and stuff
[16:33:55] <coldhead> reduced test case bro
[16:33:57] <ogk1000> I can send you a live URL tho
[16:34:00] <coldhead> distill the essence
[16:34:11] <coldhead> can you also sned the login and passwords for the live url?
[16:34:24] <coldhead> because i got some extremely unchristian images to host
[16:34:30] <coldhead> and some banner ads
[16:34:37] <coldhead> i don't really, images are gross
[16:35:00] <ogk1000> lol can I pm you the link?
[16:35:08] <coldhead> if you must
[16:35:15] <coldhead> this whole endeavour is making me very tired
[16:35:16] <ogk1000> its cool youll like it
[16:35:30] <coldhead> DON'T TELL ME WHAT I'LL LIKE PAL
[16:35:38] <ogk1000> yessa mastah
[16:37:18] <ogk1000> so you see not so easy to make a test case :( - thoughts / feedback?
[16:38:30] <skypce> hey coldhead
[16:38:36] <skypce> can you explain me this http://jsfiddle.net/8gNHg/
[16:38:47] <skypce> why appear pink before green box
[16:38:57] <skypce> i think that it is reverse
[16:39:22] <shoky> ?after @ skypce
[16:39:23] <bot-t> skypce, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[16:39:36] <shoky> X.after(Y)  means:  put Y after X
[16:40:02] <shoky> you are thinking of .insertAfter()
[16:41:10] <coldhead> skypce: change after() to before()
[16:41:23] <skypce> better
[16:41:29] <skypce> i am thinking in wrong way :S
[16:41:33] <coldhead> rocket science
[16:41:45] <skypce> very thank you
[16:41:55] <ogk1000> so I made this really cute and light-weight parallax script... I'm curious anyones professional opinion on perhaps a better way to do it? or if I'm doing something wrong: http://collabedit.com/dymh2
[16:42:29] <coldhead> my opinion is far from professional and i hate collabedit so i will defer to brighter minds
[16:42:34] <ogk1000> am I caching the variables at right location? I tried doing outside the function but it wasnt working... is it still making them cache on every resize?
[16:43:04] <ogk1000> how about this coldhead lol http://jsfiddle.net/SnPAd/
[16:43:25] <coldhead> that doesn't make me more professional ogk1000
[16:43:38] <ogk1000> no I want you to make me more professional
[16:43:42] <ogk1000> is it ok how I did it?
[16:43:52] <ogk1000> it works fine just wondering best practices approach
[16:44:22] <shoky> ogk1000: the ideal place to cache the queries is in the DOM ready handler
[16:44:38] <shoky> ogk1000: cause now you're re-querying all of those for each scroll event
[16:44:51] <ogk1000> so do I need to pass the vars to the parallax function, or?
[16:44:55] <shoky> no
[16:44:57] <coldhead> no they'll be in scope
[16:45:34] <ogk1000> so put all of it in the dom ready
[16:45:46] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/SnPAd/2/
[16:46:06] <coldhead> you better say nice things about #jQuery in a comment in your code ogk1000
[16:46:30] <ogk1000> lol
[16:46:35] <shoky> ogk1000: i edited & commented the collabedit
[16:46:46] <coldhead> brave man
[16:47:15] <ogk1000> thx guys
[16:47:23] <coldhead> shoky's is better
[16:47:29] <ogk1000> whats the diff
[16:47:39] <shoky> coldhead's has the $(window).scrollTop at the wrong place
[16:47:41] <coldhead> he recalcs scrollTOop
[16:48:01] <ogk1000> gotcha
[16:48:07] <Ontolog> I must be doing something wrong here: http://pastebin.com/vmD4qust the fail callback is always running, and it happens quickly too, before the timeout could have possible run its course
[16:49:19] <Ontolog> also tried setting jsonp to false: http://pastebin.com/wbYYDBT9
[16:49:52] <ogk1000> either way it worked well, really appreciate the help once again coldhead and shoky
[16:50:02] <Ontolog> and yes the jsonpCallback does always run and definitely within 3s
[16:50:06] <ogk1000> althought I think instead of helping you would have wrather paid me to know those things lol
[16:51:01] <shoky> Ontolog: there's a parse error.  im looking at what that jsonp request returns.. it doesnt look like normal JSONP
[16:51:27] <Ontolog> ohhh :/
[16:51:28] <Ontolog> damnit
[16:51:51] <Ontolog> what is jsonp supose to return?
[16:53:32] <shoky> Ontolog: a simple call to the callback whose name you supplied in the request, with the argument being the json object intended for response
[16:53:58] <coldhead> Ontolog: i am not sure you can use jsonp with deferreds
[16:54:08] <Ontolog> coldhead: you definitely can
[16:54:20] <Ontolog> coldhead: there are just some caveats
[16:54:36] <coldhead> good point, i just remembered my favourite code ever uses them
[16:54:45] <shoky> doesnt matter, that URL isn't returning jsonp
[16:54:45] <coldhead> i should maybe retire
[16:54:55] <shoky> it's returning the same thing it returns without the callback param
[16:55:01] <shoky> some JS code
[16:55:17] <ogk1000> shoky, are you zz on my collab post?
[16:55:20] <shoky> this is it http://www.youtube.com/iframe_api
[16:55:23] <shoky> ogk1000 yea
[16:55:29] <ogk1000> is there any reason to keep a function like that outside the DOM ?
[16:55:49] <shoky> ogk1000: outside the DOM ready handler, you mean.  only if you want to call it from somewhere else..
[16:55:57] <Ontolog> i see the problem, that iframe_api script actually attaches yet another script: http://s.ytimg.com/yts/jsbin/www-widgetapi-vflzyu6XH.js
[16:56:34] <shoky> you dont need JSONP for that.. just a regular <script> tag
[16:56:39] <shoky> and it'll run that code for you
[16:56:50] <shoky> crossdomain or whatever, no hack needed
[16:57:26] <Ontolog> i need a deferred though
[16:57:36] <Ontolog> i need to know when its done loading
[16:57:48] <shoky> then uh
[16:57:53] <Ontolog> don't worry i got it
[16:57:54] <Ontolog> thanks
[16:57:55] <shoky> go read how to properly use the API ?
[16:58:18] <shoky> youtube's API i mean
[16:58:48] <mlang> If I understand that correctly, I loose context if I use the .ajax success callback. How would I safe the "this"?
[16:59:04] <shoky> mlang:  var self = this;
[16:59:08] <shoky> is one way..
[16:59:16] <shoky> (do that outside the ajax callback of course)
[16:59:29] <mlang> shoky: Tried to do that, to verify it that I'm sending it to the console and i'm getting back a window object.
[16:59:43] <shoky> mlang: then you did it wrong
[16:59:57] <shoky> or 'this' was window to begin with ;p
[17:01:12] <mlang> shoky: Not really, setting up a JSFiddle, second please :)
[17:01:20] <coldhead> great work everyone
[17:01:37] <shoky> \o/
[17:01:56] <mlang> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/fPZH2/
[17:02:08] <mlang> Gna, still coffeescript
[17:02:13] <shoky> eek
[17:02:46] <mlang> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/fPZH2/1/ - better, I hope.
[17:03:40] <shoky> mlang: no idea what .ddsclick is..
[17:04:11] <mlang> shoky: Select Plugin, that allows me to display images in a select tag.
[17:04:13] <shoky> mlang: and there's nothing there that shows me that 'this' isn't window to begin with, in that onSelected function
[17:04:38] <mlang> Shouldn't this refer to the '.select_color' in the beginning?
[17:05:04] <shoky> but we're inside the onSelected function
[17:05:10] <shoky> 'this' can change wildly between function calls
[17:05:33] <mlang> Ah, I see.
[17:05:50] <mlang> yeah, i just figured out - moving it before the ddSlick - and it works fine.
[17:05:56] <shoky> sweet
[17:06:15] <mlang> Thanks for kicking the stone :)
[17:06:31] <shoky> muh pleasure
[17:09:09] <sunbeam> $("ul li:not(.current-item) a").click(function() {}
[17:09:13] <sunbeam> does anyone see what i am doing wrong here?
[17:09:56] <shoky> sunbeam it looks.. ok. but smells like you should be using event delegation instead
[17:10:18] <jacoluta> yea looks good
[17:14:23] <sunbeam> shoky: yes
[17:17:52] <shoky> yeeap
[17:19:01] <mlang> shoky: Can I follow up with the problem? Something else, quite weird appeared.
[17:19:11] <shoky> ya
[17:20:23] <mlang> So, my ddSlick Plugin is actually replacing the $(this) - the select tag - so I actually want to save the parent div to a variable.
[17:20:38] <mlang> So I try it via that = $(this).parent('div')
[17:20:59] <mlang> I am positive that the selector is correct - but If i send it to the console, i'm just getting a reference object, not the element itself.
[17:21:34] <shoky> what do you mean, a reference object?
[17:22:07] <shoky> it should be a jquery object
[17:22:15] <shoky> wrapping the element
[17:22:25] <mlang> Yeah - exactly. Sorry for the wrong nomenclature.
[17:22:37] <mlang> How would I access the element directly?
[17:23:03] <shoky> that[0]  but, why?
[17:23:39] <shoky> ah just to log
[17:23:46] <mlang> Yep.
[17:23:51] <shoky> good to check that.length
[17:24:07] <shoky> if its 0 something is uh-oh
[17:24:09] <mlang> Returns 0.
[17:24:12] <shoky> heh
[17:24:37] <shoky> ok, backstep, console.log( $(this) )
[17:24:40] <shoky> er
[17:24:45] <shoky> console.log( $(this).length )
[17:25:09] <shoky> are you sure that element has a direct parent <div> ?
[17:25:36] <mlang> shoky: Yeah, that was the problem - Read the wrong DOM. The direct parent is a <span>
[17:25:42] <shoky> ah
[17:26:16] <ogk1000> http://jsfiddle.net/pLKmz/30/ - if I wanted to have these links come in sequentially... is there an easy way to do a loop with like 100ms between each coming in?
[17:26:26] <mlang> shoky: Okay.. Makes a lot more sense now :)
[17:26:38] <shoky> ;]
[17:26:38] <mlang> Thanks again, don't worry! Ill be back with more novice questions.
[17:32:10] <shoky> ogk1000: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pLKmz/32/
[17:33:44] <ogk1000> shoky, can I have some chick blow you?
[17:34:04] <coldhead> that's fucking exquisite shoky
[17:34:11] <shoky> ogk1000: that'd be welcome
[17:34:17] <shoky> shuddup Fatty
[17:34:22] <coldhead> no really
[17:34:27] <shoky> lol. thanx
[17:34:42] <ogk1000> I guess sometimes its worth it to jsfiddle away
[17:34:58] <coldhead> almost always
[17:35:28] <shoky> sometimes even more than always
[17:35:32] <nerk> why is it that when I disable transitions in jquery.mobile, on a phone the lag shows a black screen when loading a new view?
[17:35:47] <nerk> and is this fixable? or should I not have defaultTransitions set to none?
[17:35:59] <ogk1000> lol
[17:36:05] <nerk> fyi, the view is another local file.. phonegap
[17:36:48] <shoky> donno but i really gotta peepee.
[17:37:23] <nerk> think about it while you go peepee and maybe you'll have a solution for me
[17:37:24] <nerk> lol
[17:37:53] <nerk> my solution is to not use ajax at all.. if I don't have transitions.. that might smooth views when swapping.. but I like ajax as I don't need to refetch all my js..
[17:47:09] <ogk1000> thx again for help shoky
[17:47:10] <ogk1000> I owe ya 1
[17:53:11] <nerk> has anyone experiencing a "blacking" transition after setting the jquery.mobile transition default to 'none' ?
[17:53:29] <nerk> s/experiencing/experienced/
[18:24:45] <hateIE> heh..damn it.. i had to abandon that onajaxcomplete crap
[18:25:18] <hateIE> nested my second ajax request in the complete event of the first one and it works 10 times better and simpler
[18:31:52] <hateIE> so the real solution is just do 1 ajax request which returns every thing you need with Json
[18:46:41] <jacoluta> hateIE: haha
[19:26:53] <hlveheart> is there a non-flash solution to add to a users clipboard?
[19:30:02] <ericandrewlewis> so, i have a full page image slider i'm using. my client wants the bottom of the image to always show.
[19:30:27] <ericandrewlewis> i figure i'm probably going to have to dig in a bit to the jquery of the plugin, but i thought i'd ask, anyone know of a plugin that will do this, or any other clever suggestions?
[19:36:33] <tw2113> eh?
[19:37:11] <tw2113> ericandrewlewis
[19:37:35] <ericandrewlewis> tw2113: you had me thinking i accidentally asked this in #wordpress for a second there

[21:02:29] <williamherry> tw2113: thanks
[21:13:58] <Kunnis> I'm using $('').load('/url') to load a block of table.  When I put the markup directly in the page, the table renders correctly, but when I .load it, the elements don't line up correctly.  Of course this is IE only.  Any thoughts on what might be wrong in my markup?  The table is well-formed, and has no colspans nor rowspans
[21:14:20] <Kunnis> it works right in FF
[21:14:35] <coldhead> does /url have a complete html page?
[21:14:38] <coldhead> or just a table?
[21:14:44] <coldhead> or wat
[21:15:34] <Kunnis> Just the table's markup
[21:16:05] <Kunnis> I've checked the response from the ie debugging tool, and the response looks correct
[21:17:31] <coldhead> so you're sure it's not loading a table into a table or something, you're not going to end up with <table<table>...</table></table> ?
[21:17:45] <Cork> (don't forget the tbody)
[21:18:07] <coldhead> because Fx etc are more forgiving about that kind of thing so if you're seeing it in IE it sounds like it might be invalid markup
[21:19:00] <coldhead> $('table').load('/url') might be weird if /url also includes <table>, ya feel me
[21:19:24] <Kunnis> The $('#foo') is a div
[21:19:36] <coldhead> i am mollified
[21:19:43] <Kunnis> the cells don't line up right... normally it's like 10 columns wide, but there's some that go out 11 columns
[21:20:16] <coldhead> i would ask if you have a live demo but i don't have IE with me today :(
[21:20:21] <Kunnis> what faux pax am I making?  (I'm displaying tabular data, the first row is headers)
[21:20:39] <coldhead> you have thead and tbody?
[21:20:59] <coldhead> non-ie will add them for you behidn the scenes
[21:21:20] * Kunnis looks around suspicouly about thead and tbody.
[21:23:59] <Cork> Kunnis: if you have a link i could have a look
[21:24:03] <Kunnis> I fixed the <table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
[21:24:12] <Kunnis> It's now nested properly
[21:24:52] <Kunnis> https://kunnis.com/EProfit/
[21:26:09] <Kunnis> it seems like some phantom cells are appearing randomly
[21:26:15] <Kunnis> the jquery takes a bit
[21:26:32] <Cork> does it happen in all versions of ie?
[21:27:18] <Kunnis> Dunno, it happens in IE9
[21:27:31] <Cork> hmm the ajax call doesn't resolve
[21:27:43] <Kunnis> 404's or times out?
[21:27:52] <Cork> just pending
[21:27:59] <Kunnis> the ajax takes like 2 mins.
[21:28:04] <Cork> aj
[21:28:06] <Kunnis> it's generating a report on the server
[21:28:08] <Cork> jiks
[21:28:22] <Kunnis> I'm solving my problems one at a time
[21:29:18] <mdedetrich> is there something like a slideTo plugin (which is like slideDown but also accounts from going larger -> smaller as well as smaller -> larger)
[21:29:23] <Kunnis> and yes, it's spewing back a lot of markup.
[21:29:28] <mdedetrich> *plugin = function
[21:31:22] <Cork> Kunnis: do you have any comments in the ajax response?
[21:31:43] <Cork> or is all the empty text nodes just indentations?
[21:32:36] <Kunnis> no comments
[21:32:38] <Kunnis> just markup
[21:32:39] <Cork> and you should really think about using infinite scroll
[21:32:55] <Cork> browsers don't like 22000+ lines of table rows
[21:33:10] <Kunnis> There's only 1000 rows :X
[21:33:19] <Cork> ya, but the source is
[21:33:47] <Kunnis> I'm trying to refactor it a bit at a time.
[21:34:22] <Kunnis> This looks just fine if I just put this markup in the page directly
[21:34:23] <Cork> there finnaly managed to save it from firefox >_>
[21:34:31] <Cork> lets see if ie likes a static version better
[21:35:28] <Cork> UGG!!
[21:35:36] <Kunnis> ??
[21:35:37] <Cork> Kunnis: you're using quirks mode
[21:35:47] <Kunnis> IE is showing IE9 mode
[21:35:48] <Cork> that gives all kind of weird effects
[21:35:54] <Kunnis> to me
[21:35:57] <Cork> you don't have a doctype
[21:36:03] <Kunnis> *facepalms*
[21:36:03] <Cork> == quirks mode
[21:36:16] <Cork> <!doctype html>
[21:36:39] <coldhead> <!doctype html "be cool">
[21:37:02] <Kunnis> I already have the doctype in there
[21:37:16] <Cork> not in the page i loaded
[21:37:25] <Kunnis> view the page source
[21:37:36] <Cork> i did
[21:37:54] <Cork> its in the exported html file i saw it
[21:38:47] <Cork> hmm
[21:38:48] <Kunnis> when I view source, I see it
[21:38:51] <Cork> scratch that
[21:39:06] <Cork> for some reason the export lost the doctype O_o
[21:40:23] <Cork> ok, if i give ie the status html it loads fine
[21:40:31] <Cork> so it is its error correction thats causing it
[21:41:10] <Kunnis> ???
[21:42:00] <Cork> still diagnosing
[21:43:55] <Cork> hmm you're putting a table in a span
[21:44:03] <Cork> that's not strictly valid
[21:44:26] <Cork> have you tried replacing <span id="data"></span> with <div id="data"></div> ?
[21:44:26] <Kunnis> let me re-test with that
[21:44:35] <Kunnis> already testing
[21:44:55] <Kunnis> still doing it
[21:44:55] <coldhead> straws are being grasped at
[21:46:23] <Abhijit> hi. i have button 1 and button 2. if user click button 1 it goes to process 1 and process 1 then goes to process 2. if user clicks on buton 2 it directly goes to process 2 and skips process 1. how do i know that the user came here by pressing button 1 or button 2 so that i can then execte jquery ajax if its button 2
[21:46:45] <pandu101> hey guys Im using ajax to grab the exchange rate from a 3rd party. But Im not able to use the exchange rate to do calculations since its received after the page loads. How can I save the exchange rate in a var and do other things.
[21:47:29] <monkey> pandu101: umm .. use the same javascript/jquery you're using to 'do' ajax, to 'do' calculations after the page loads?
[21:47:46] <monkey> Feel free to clarify if I've missed something.
[21:48:16] <monkey> Abhijit: by 'process' 1 and 2, do you mean they're different pages, or just divs in a slide/accordion etc?
[21:48:25] <Abhijit> moneal, different web pages
[21:48:57] <pandu101> monkey: Thanks. The problem is that I also need to wait for use input. So this is what happens: Page loads, exchange rate is grabbed, user enters some number to convert to currency2 and then I convert it using the exchange rate and the user input
[21:49:34] <Abhijit> monkey, different web pages
[21:50:02] <monkey> So the exchange rate is grabbed, via ajax, and held until they enter a number (currency value) and invoke 'conversion'?  Are you using jQuery $.get/$.ajax etc?  Or rolled-your-own?
[21:50:30] <pandu101> im using jQuery $.ajax
[21:51:22] <monkey> So you grab the exchange rate out of 'data', then hold it in a variable, then when they say 'convert' (hit a button/link/img/div etc), you call a javascript function to do the calculation using the input field for currency, x the exchange?
[21:51:26] <snufft> hi guys
[21:52:20] <pandu101> monkey: that is what I tried to do, ie hold data in a variable but it always comes up as undefined when i try to use it. my guess is that the ajax is too slow for the var to hold the data?
[21:52:49] <snufft> it looks like $(window).resize() is triggered  for every pixel that the browser window is moved, before you let go of the mouse button. Is there a similar event that only fires once the window has been resized and the mouse button is released?
[21:53:05] <Cork> Kunnis: have you tried removing the indentation in the ajax response?
[21:53:07] <tw2113> mouseup snufft
[21:53:41] <monkey> pandu101: jump onto pastebin and show us the (specific) HTML and javascript in question.
[21:53:53] <pandu101> okay
[21:54:14] <snufft> tw2113: as in $(window).resize(function() { $this.mouseup(........ ?
[21:55:16] <tw2113> no that'd treat it like a method, if my terminology is correct
[21:55:40] <tw2113> ?mouseup
[21:55:40] <bot-t1> .mouseup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mouseup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseup/
[21:55:50] <tw2113> eh, guess it would have a method
[21:56:27] <tw2113> but there you go snufft
[21:57:07] <Cork> Kunnis: i can say this much for sure, you're experiencing a ie rendering or parsing bug
[21:57:24] <tw2113> way to be vague cork :)
[21:57:25] <Cork> Kunnis: if the file is loaded statically ie renders it just fine
[21:57:45] <Cork> tw2113: the problem is there is absolutely nothing to go on
[21:58:05] <Cork> the only thing i can think of is its conditional comments messing things up
[21:58:16] <tw2113> just teasing you and IE
[21:58:20] <pandu101> monkey: here is the code --> http://pastebin.com/4Kc6xdS2

[22:00:03] <Cork> no, not yet...
[22:01:20] <tw2113> i have now, then
[22:02:14] <Cork> Kunnis: yup its the indentations causing it
[22:02:45] <Cork> Kunnis: if you remove all the extra spaces around the td elements the bugs go away

[22:05:10] <Abhijit> hi. i have button 1 and button 2. if user click button 1 it goes to process 1 and process 1 then goes to process 2. if user clicks on buton 2 it directly goes to process 2 and skips process 1. process 1 & 2 are on two seperate web pages. how do i know that the user came here by pressing button 1 or button 2 so that i can then execte jquery ajax if its button 2
[22:05:19] <Cork> when i found that latest android browser doesn't support websocket O_o
[22:05:34] <Cork> (and none of the earlier versions does either)
[22:05:49] <tw2113> i'm on like my 4th loop
[22:05:54] <tw2113> ?.of tonight
[22:05:55] <bot-t1> tw2113, Guards carry scoring load at Princeton - The Daily Targum: Men's ... - http://www.princetonbasketball.com/f/49093
[22:07:03] <monkey> Abhijit: really basic way; after hitting button 1 and submitting to the first page, render a hidden input, name='button', value="1".
[22:07:07] <r500> http://jsfiddle.net/GGeZq/3/  radio button on selecting the vlaue is coming undefined
[22:07:29] <Abhijit> monkey, ok that will 'set' the information for me. now how do i 'get' this information on next page?
[22:07:38] <r500> oops got
[22:07:45] <monkey> Abhijit: then on the second page do the same, same input name, value="2".  By the time you get to the page to make the decision, you will have a successful control called 'button' that will either have one value or two, be it '1' or '2'.
[22:07:57] <r500> its name and am taknig ids in jquery event
[22:08:00] <r500> :p
[22:08:34] <monkey> Abhijit: each page is submitting the variable as a hidden input, and the next page is testing for its value/values.
[22:08:37] <tw2113> Cork, now i have to go listen to the original
[22:08:42] <monkey> What are you using server-side?  PHP?
[22:09:24] <pandu101> monkey: here is the code on the exchange rate thingy --> http://pastebin.com/4Kc6xdS2
[22:09:43] <pandu101> check out lines 77-99
[22:09:44] <Abhijit> monkey, i see. let me see. no this is fully frontend jquery thing only nothing with php. upon testing the if (button 1) {do nothing} else {do jquery ajx}
[22:10:20] <pandu101> that is where Im grabbing rate from 3rd part and trying to save it, return it but its always undefined.
[22:11:14] <monkey> Uh, yeah .. so you're doing a query with ajax - and what's the requesting?  A server-side page that's processing something?  Or just 'GET'ting a plain page, no processing?
[22:11:25] <monkey> s/the req/that req/;
[22:11:54] <pandu101> monkey: talking to me?
[22:12:18] <pandu101> the requester is jquery
[22:12:30] <monkey> pandu101: not yet dude, will name you if/when I do.  I'm checking out your code though and trying to 'get it' (at the same time Abhijit's, and my own li'l project drama going on)
[22:12:49] <tw2113> monkeymulti-tasker
[22:12:56] <pandu101> monkey: okay cool, thanks :) take your time
[22:13:00] <monkey> You should see me at feeding time.

[22:16:49] <monkey> Maybe it's old Lynx devs finally too jealous of UI sexiness.
[22:16:55] <Cork> there is quite a lot of ppl using ui
[22:17:53] <prishabh> ?down jquery.com
[22:17:58] <bot-t1> prishabh, It's not just you! - http://jquery.com looks down from here.
[22:18:35] <coldhead> it's okay, jquery.org is up
[22:18:40] <coldhead> and that site is more important really
[22:18:44] <Cork> lol
[22:19:04] <monkey> pandu101: I've had a quick couple of skims.  So what exactly is the error/quirk?
[22:19:38] <prishabh> how goes it coldhead, PM?
[22:19:40] <pandu101> monkey: Im not able to pass the data from ajax to other parts of jquery
[22:19:42] <monkey> You're saying you think ajax might not be fast enough?  I mean you're getting the alert (rate1) successfully?  But from what I read, your calculation function doesn't actually 'use' the rate?
[22:20:32] <pandu101> monkey: yes first i wrote the app to use a static exchange rate. Now im trying to get real time exchange rate but am stuck at passing the rate from ajax to the rest of jquery code
[22:20:51] <pandu101> the alert(rate1) leads to undefined
[22:21:19] <pandu101> monkey: so essentially i want to know how to pass variables b/w ajax and others
[22:21:47] <pandu101> here is the front end: http://ezex-bongu.rhcloud.com/
[22:22:03] <monkey> pandu101: I should add here that I'm no expert, just a n00b with a few weeks of pain^H^H^H^H experience under my belt..
[22:22:27] <pandu101> monkey: ha ha .. well thanks for trying
[22:22:36] <pandu101> im a noob as well
[22:23:38] <monkey> pandu101: now, you've declared rate1 'globally' enough, so it should be visible, and you assign it to the output of checkrate(), but like I said; where do you bring the rate into the calculation of the final amount?
[22:23:59] <snufft> tw2113: cheers : )I'll have  alook :)
[22:24:40] <pandu101> monkey: I'm not using the rate in the calculation yet. That's the next part. Once I figure out how to grab the rate from the ajax i'll start using it in the calculation. The calculation is done by hardcoding the exchange rate for now.
[22:24:52] <monkey> pandu101: wait .. that's the "dollar = usrInput1/82;" line?
[22:24:57] <monkey> That's the old static exchange rate?
[22:25:04] <pandu101> monkey: yes - you got it!
[22:25:04] <prishabh> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4903326
[22:25:21] <monkey> So      ..... userInput1 / rate1?
[22:25:37] <pandu101> monkey: yes thats next step
[22:26:02] <pandu101> monkey: but rate1 is nothing right now. It just says "Undefined" if i alert it.
[22:26:05] <monkey> pandu101: or more accurately; usrInput1 / checkrate()
[22:26:16] <pandu101> monkey: yup
[22:26:51] <monkey> (assuming you just support one exchange rate, in your magic javascript dual-currency world.
[22:27:44] <pandu101> even within checkrate(), im not able to get rate1. If I alert it there its undefined. But I know Im getting the rate cos it shows up on my page.
[22:28:26] <pandu101> oh wait! just had an idea...
[22:28:47] <monkey> .. within #calbutton.click() have you alerted() checkrate()?
[22:28:56] <monkey> s/alerted/console.log'd/;
[22:29:16] <pandu101> monkey: what does s/alerted/... do?
[22:29:33] <pandu101> does it print the alert onto the console?
[22:30:19] <Cork> pandu101: he meant use console.log instead of alert
[22:30:25] <monkey> Well it sends the text to the browser console, yeah.  Just a little cleaner, non-system-modal, and isn't 'as' ugly if you leave it in there on a page.
[22:30:47] <Cork> and doesn't risk messing up the flow of the page
[22:30:53] <pandu101> ohh okay: i'll start using that
[22:30:57] <monkey> Yeah sorry, old habit of talking pseudo-sed commands back in my uni days.  Ah IRC.  Who needed girls.
[22:31:10] <pandu101> monkey: lol
[22:31:23] <Cork> moneal: s// is quite common irc slang actually
[22:31:31] <coldhead> ALRIGHT EVERYONE, JQUERY.COM IS DOWN BUT DON'T PANIC I AM CALLING YOUR PARENTS AND THEY ARE COMING TO GET YOU
[22:31:36] <monkey> Oh awesome!  I thought I was just oldschoo'!
[22:31:48] <pandu101> I remember I impressed a girl once my showing her how to use "talk"...
[22:32:10] <monkey> omg!  If jquery.com is down .. do I have to start using document.getElementById() again?!!?!?@#$?%?$^?1111one
[22:32:47] <Cork> lol ie fails there own testdrive page -_-'
[22:32:58] <Cork> but chrome and firefox works fine >_<
[22:33:05] <monkey> omg pandu101: my mate tried to pick a girl up once using talkd .. she just looked up, saw we were the only other two people in the comp.lab .. and never made eye contact in lectures - again.
[22:33:08] <Cork> http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/Flexin/Default.html
[22:34:23] <monkey> pandu101: how'd the 'new idea' for your script go?
[22:34:37] <pandu101> monkey: LOL - something similar happened to me. Girl was lab asst and we were friends. And then I show her my "talk" magic while sitting on a diff terminal and she freaks out and Im like.. yahh baby! :)
[22:35:07] * monkey shakes head
[22:35:21] <monkey> Something makes me think, tonight, you'll have more success with checkrate() scoping.
[22:35:35] <monkey> On that note; any progress?
[22:35:43] <pandu101> monkey: i've been thinkign about that girl so haven't tried my new idea...
[22:35:51] <Cork> LOL
[22:35:54] * monkey shudders
[22:36:08] <monkey> No wonder you've been typing slow.
[22:36:26] <pandu101> its called recharging the brain... i think
[22:36:37] <monkey> Uh huh.  Whatever you kids call it these days.
[22:36:58] <coldhead> ew
[22:37:40] <pandu101> cos my brain lives down there...
[22:37:51] <Cork> ...
[22:38:44] <monkey> ohhhhhh kaaaaaay .. motivation to assist   . .. ... quickly .. fading . ..
[22:39:42] <monkey> sheilablackrose: you from Oz?
[22:39:56] <sheilablackrose> yeah
[22:40:09] <sheilablackrose> whats up
[22:40:10] <sheilablackrose> :P
[22:40:35] <monkey> Ah.  Small world.  I'm from the "lucky" country also, but o/s at the moment, so your hostname reminded me of home (heh)
[22:41:05] <sheilablackrose> thats kewl :)
[22:41:25] <sheilablackrose> the weathe ris getting better
[22:41:33] <monkey> Seems unlike war, oil and money: jQuery knows no political boundaries.
[22:41:59] <sheilablackrose> hi guys if i have a dynamic table row with a class <tr class="showFlagRow" >. is there a way i can hide the row that is clicked?
[22:42:02] <monkey> Getting better?  My Asus Transformer is telling me tomorrow's -4 here.
[22:42:07] <sheilablackrose> lol
[22:42:18] <sheilablackrose> hahaha
[22:42:25] <sheilablackrose> :p
[22:42:27] <monkey> So either I'm in the wrong f@#%%ing country, or I should have gotten an iPad.
[22:42:49] <Cork> sheilablackrose: $('table').on('click', 'tr', function() { $(this).hide(); });
[22:43:21] <monkey> Hey man I'd actually rather be in -4 than +38.
[22:44:24] <monkey> .. unless I was in Fiji.  In which I'd be firmly planted in a pool-bar all day.  And by firmly-planted, I mean loosely-floating-near.
[22:45:27] <monkey> Just an aside for the channel; how many people have taken up QUnit; majority?  Is it just gaining speed, or is it arcane voodoo?
[22:45:49] <sheilablackrose> hahaha
[22:46:22] <sheilablackrose> Hi Cork. this the code im using im clicking an image on a column n hiding the column next to it. now i would like to hide the row below it. http://jsfiddle.net/DFqPP/
[22:47:01] <sheilablackrose> basically i was tonggling the 10<td>
[22:50:14] <monkey> sheilablackrose: $('table').on('click', 'tr', function() { $(this).next().hide(); }); ?
[22:51:06] <Cork> sheilablackrose: $('table').on('click', 'tr.showFlagRow', function() { $(this).next().hide(); });
[22:51:28] * monkey coughs and nods, humbly
[22:51:31] <sheilablackrose> thanks buddy
[22:51:44] <sheilablackrose> i tried coming up with one myself
[22:51:48] <sheilablackrose>   $(this).closest("tr").hide(); this ownt work?
[22:51:55] <Cork> sheilablackrose: or possibly even $('table').on('click', 'tr.showFlagRow', function() { $(this).next(':not(.showFlagRow)').hide(); });
[22:52:37] <sheilablackrose> ok ill try that thanks
[23:00:17] <sheilablackrose> cork is here away to do it with a image click
[23:00:29] <sheilablackrose> i tried $(this).closest("tr").hide(); but it hides the same row. could i use .next()
[23:00:34] <sheilablackrose> i tried $(this).closest("tr").hide(); but it hides the same row. could i use .next('tr')
[23:00:52] <pandu101> monkey: I gave my idea a try and it did not work. so basically its a scoping issue? the variables within .ajax are not accessible outside of .ajax?
[23:00:55] <monkey> closest("tr").next().hide()
[23:01:08] <sheilablackrose> basically im clicking on an image
[23:01:14] <monkey> So hopefully that selects the surrounding tr, then its next sibling, then hides 'that'.
[23:01:20] <sheilablackrose> oh ok
[23:01:25] <sheilablackrose> let me try that
[23:01:27] <sheilablackrose> i was close :p
[23:01:28] <monkey> Yep, so closest("tr") should select its container.
[23:01:38] * monkey types with crossed fingers
[23:02:18] <monkey> pandu101: heh man, ajax 'scoping' == javascript scoping.  It's not a different environment/context.  A function's a function.
[23:02:19] <sheilablackrose> testing it now
[23:03:06] <monkey> pandu101: I'm uncomfortable with you putting the value into the textbox val(), then pulling it back out of there for 'rate'.  It *shouldn't* break anything, but it's messy and indirect.
[23:04:04] <pandu101> monkey: yah i agree with you. its something im doing in desperation cos i cant seem to access the rate, even though i can print it to screen
[23:04:08] <sheilablackrose> awesome it works
[23:04:19] <sheilablackrose> is the way im doing this right? i feel like there is a bteer way
[23:04:20] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/DFqPP/2/
[23:04:24] <sheilablackrose> im using a count
[23:04:36] <sheilablackrose> than alternate th eif statement to tonggle the hide/show
[23:05:03] <sheilablackrose> does jquery have something like status ? hide show
[23:06:17] <monkey> sheilablackrose: Oh I see.  You put me off with the number '10' being used before.  I thought there was a toggling of some sort . . .
[23:06:22] * monkey alt-tabs and Googles like a madman
[23:06:53] <monkey> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[23:06:55] <monkey> Heh.
[23:07:15] <sheilablackrose> let me check it out
[23:07:34] <monkey> If it's not *exactly* what you need, your money back*.
[23:07:54] <monkey> *this guarantee is fake.
[23:08:43] <monkey> pandu101: what's the last line where you can show the rate (either by alert or console)?
[23:10:17] <pandu101> guys: figured out the solution - it was to set the ajax async flag to sync. Talking to u guys was helpful. narrowed the problem down to scoping. the solution was from SO --> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5976142/variable-scope-question-in-my-jquery
[23:10:57] <pandu101> monkey: thanks for your help and the good times - he he :)
[23:11:33] <monkey> Argh k.  I thought that could be an issue on slower links, but thought since it was alert()ing successfully, it mightn't be a problem for the moment.
[23:12:51] <pandu101> talking thru a problem is so helpful - better than getting the solution, makes u think harder...
[23:13:21] <sheilablackrose> monkey :  $(this).closest("tr").next().tonggle(); didnt work :(
[23:13:41] <monkey> Ah.  And I thought jQuery 1.8 supported .tonggle().
[23:13:43] * monkey giggles
[23:15:12] <Cork> ?.toggle
[23:15:12] <bot-t1> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[23:15:20] <Cork> ?.toggle 2
[23:15:21] <bot-t1> Cork, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[23:15:28] <Cork> ?.toggle 1
[23:15:29] <bot-t1> Cork, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[23:15:31] <Cork> bah
[23:16:19] <turbolihis> sheilablackrose: try toggle instead of tonggle
[23:16:45] <monkey> Man, that was my joke.  Tough crowwwwd.
[23:17:36] <monkey> Alright, when you can't make jokes in #jQuery, you know it's time for bed.
[23:17:49] <sheilablackrose> so the visibility of the row i would just need to specify toggle() right
[23:18:09] <sheilablackrose> ahh
[23:18:11] <sheilablackrose> i used tonggle
[23:19:04] <Cork> monkey: jokes only works if the other party understands that it is a joke
[23:19:16] <monkey> :(
[23:19:22] <Cork> if its quiet for a longer period of time they most likely missed it
[23:20:18] <monkey> I was hedging my bets that he was either furiously Googling for other uses of "tonggle", or had fallen off his chair crying in the foetal position.
[23:20:38] <Cork> :)
[23:22:06] <monkey> Thanks for the good times guys.  It's been emotional.
[23:31:42] <sheilablackrose> can anyone point me in the right way for styling checkbox? using image n stuff
[23:32:25] <Cork> sheilablackrose: input:checked + label { background-image: url(); padding-left: 16px; }
[23:32:59] <Cork> and input[type="checkbox"] { display: none; }
[23:33:54] <Cork> <input type="checkbox" id="test"><label for="test">title</label>
[23:35:18] <sheilablackrose> input:checked + label { background-image: url(); padding-left: 16px; } where do i do this?
[23:35:20] <sheilablackrose> in a css file?
[23:35:24] <Cork> yes
[23:35:45] <sheilablackrose> than i do <input type="checkbox" id="test" class="mycss">
[23:35:46] <sheilablackrose> ?
[23:35:53] <Cork> yup
[23:36:16] <Cork> the id on the checbox needs to be uniq for each checkbox and match to there label
[23:38:38] <sheilablackrose> im a bit confused on the firts part in css i do .mycheckbox { input:checked + label { background-image: url("images/ckbchecked.png"); padding-left: 16px; } } input[type="checkbox"] {  background-image: url("images/ckb.png"); padding-left: 16px; } }
[23:38:42] <sheilablackrose> is that right?
[23:39:02] <Cork> no
[23:39:19] <Cork> you should make input[type="checkbox"] display: none;
[23:39:29] <Cork> it should never be visible (you would see the old one if you do)
[23:40:06] <Cork> the image is in input[type="checkbox"] + label and input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label
[23:40:21] <sheilablackrose> let me try it out
[23:40:47] <Cork> and it's important that there is nothing in between the label and the checkbox
[23:43:47] <sheilablackrose> im getting massive errors
[23:44:03] <sheilablackrose> in my css i create a class .flagCheckBox {
[23:44:04] <sheilablackrose> }
[23:44:05] <sheilablackrose> right
[23:44:42] <sheilablackrose> but this line causes error  input:checked + label { background-image: url("images/ckbchecked.png"); padding-left: 16px; }
[23:44:53] <sheilablackrose> is there a specific way of uising it
[23:48:06] <cat3> howdy, folks!
[23:48:28] <Cork> sheilablackrose: "cases error" ?
[23:48:38] <cat3> greetings from the far east!
[23:48:38] <sheilablackrose> causes error
[23:48:42] <sheilablackrose> when i do this
[23:48:55] <Cork> error is too generic
[23:49:10] <Cork> what happens
[23:49:16] <cat3> i'm a boorish PHP programmer, trying to learn the excellent jquery to make beautiful interfaces
[23:49:18] <sheilablackrose> .flagCheckBox {
[23:49:18] <sheilablackrose>       input:checked + label { background-image: url("images/ckbchecked.png"); padding-left: 16px; }
[23:49:18] <sheilablackrose> }
[23:49:34] <Cork> uh...
[23:49:44] <Cork> you know how to write css right?
[23:49:56] <Cork> sheilablackrose: what i gave you was a full selector
[23:50:10] <Cork> you can't style checkboxes, so you need to hide it and fake it
[23:50:31] <tw2113> turn your checkboxes into gspots?fake
[23:50:40] * tw2113 goes to the unhelpful corner
[23:50:51] <sheilablackrose> sorry im still new
[23:50:55] <sheilablackrose> do explain please
[23:50:59] <Cork> sheilablackrose: if you need more help try asking in #css
[23:51:06] <sheilablackrose> ok
[23:53:31] <cat3> i have a question about jquery and bootstrap
[23:54:13] <Cork> ?ask
[23:54:13] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:54:15] <cat3> i'm using a bootstrap popover, $('.my-popover)(). how do I get the ID of the element?
[23:54:43] <cat3> this.id and $(this).attr('id') don't work
[23:55:35] <cat3> for a .click() function, I can retrieve the id fine. but I'm trying to get it from within the popover function.
[23:55:53] <Cork> $('.my-popover)() is not valid so what is it you mean?
[23:56:52] <cat3> sorry, $('.my-popover').popover()
[23:57:30] <Cork> so you mean you're trying to do it in the popover callback?
[23:57:44] <Cork> popover(function() { /* get id? */ })
[23:58:18] <cat3> no - i'm passing parameters into the popover function. Id like one of those parameters to include the id. let me jsfiddle it for you :)
