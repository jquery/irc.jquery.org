[00:11:27] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/6sEcTdZ4 can someone help me with some transitions. each image is a different size, i want them to transition instead of changing suddenly. I think i need to change height and width?
[00:26:10] <maxaud1> Hey guys, I have a website with two jquery "tabbed" sections on the page.
[00:26:10] <maxaud1> Both are setup to rotate through their tabs automatically but for some reason only one does it.. can someone tell me why and give direction as to how I can fix it?
[00:26:10] <maxaud1> http://www.apstraining.com/cae/caeaps-ffs-ip-standardization-session-1-1/cae-aps-ffs-ip-high-altitude-loc-i/detailed-analysis-of-upset-event-high-altitude-stall-737ng/
[00:27:23] <Woet> ?paste @ maxaud1
[00:27:23] <bot-t1> maxaud1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:27:37] <Woet> tons of non-relevant code to look through at your site
[00:29:19] <na3r> hi, i have <div class="searched">this is a test</div>. how can i say that just change test color
[00:29:27] <maxaud1> Will try to paste the code, it's all created dynamically. just a sec
[00:34:21] <Woet> na3r: i'll assume you thoroughly read the documentation and google?
[00:34:38] <Woet> http://www.google.nl/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=change+text+color+of+class+jquery&hl=en
[00:35:43] <beanluc> All right... I definitely confirmed that I have the right selector, because I can alert the attr("checked") of my checkbox... Why can I not get the .change() or .click() events off it?
[00:35:46] <na3r> Woet, i know that. i wanna find a text and just change the color of searched text . not whole the text. sorry for my english
[00:36:02] <Woet> na3r: no reason why the documentation and my link doesn't apply
[00:36:16] <na3r> Woet, i used this code $('.searchedItem:contains({$searchedItem})').css('color','red');
[00:36:17] <maxaud1> Woet: here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/VVEfS/
[00:36:50] <Woet> na3r: what should the :contains do?
[00:37:22] <Woet> maxaud1: you don't use the jquery tabs?
[00:37:27] <na3r> Woet, selects the element that contains the searched item
[00:37:45] <Woet> na3r: you want to turn all classes 'searched' red, right?
[00:38:04] <Woet> na3r: or just a word in the class searched?
[00:38:18] <maxaud1> Woet: no, It's a 'homegrown' jQuery function. Just trying to figure out why I cannot automatically cyle multiple per groups of tabs per page
[00:38:20] <na3r> Woet, the second one
[00:38:49] <Woet> na3r: well, css won't work like that
[00:38:53] <maxaud1> per = tab**
[00:38:59] <Woet> you can't color just a word inside a class without html
[00:39:26] <Woet> na3r: so put a span around the words you want to highlight and turn those red
[00:39:34] <Woet> either server side or jquery
[00:41:48] <na3r> Woet, span around all word. you mean something like <div class="searched"><span>this</span><span>is</span><span>test</test></div>
[00:42:22] <Woet> na3r: <div class="searched">this is a very long search result and since you searched for <span class="highlight">na3r</span> i will turn that red</div>
[00:42:26] <Woet> .higlight { color: red }
[00:43:28] <na3r> Woet, this is my problem. how to add a <span> around searched item
[00:43:42] <Woet> na3r: why can't you do that server side?
[00:43:51] <skylamer`> get the word and just wrap it with a span tag :)
[00:44:02] <Woet> it would be silly to let the client do that
[00:44:08] <Woet> which is possible btw, just silly
[00:44:52] <na3r> Woet, ok. tnx for your help
[00:45:33] <Woet> maxaud1: the only thing i can imagine is one timer overriding the other
[00:45:39] <Woet> but that seems fine
[00:45:56] <beanluc> OK, answer to my question: "Why can I not get the .change() or .click() events off a checkbox?" is, It works if I put the whole thing in a document.ready() but not if I just let the listener be bare
[00:46:37] <Woet> maxaud1: is interval_shortcodes a global variable?
[00:48:02] <maxaud1> Woet: I don't think so. All code is shown there.
[00:48:32] <Woet> maxaud1: then i don't see how interval_shortcodes is passed between auto_rotate and goToSlide
[00:48:44] <Woet> but  that shouldnt cause your issue
[00:48:58] <gyzmodo> hello
[00:49:09] <gyzmodo> i've a problem with jcarousel
[00:49:19] <gyzmodo> it shows only one image
[00:49:33] <gyzmodo> but when i resize it shows other 4 images
[00:49:39] <gyzmodo> i set visible to 4

[00:50:14] <Woet> ?demo @ gyzmodo
[00:50:15] <bot-t1> gyzmodo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:01:40] <gyzmodo> Woet, http://jsfiddle.net/2y8h2/
[01:01:46] <gyzmodo> look here
[01:01:51] <gyzmodo> it's my markup
[01:02:07] <Woet> gyzmodo: not a very working demo is it..
[01:02:37] <danheberden> such a verbose demo for a simple carousel
[01:02:53] <gyzmodo> so markup is correct?
[01:03:08] <Woet> am i saying that?
[01:04:12] <gyzmodo> nope, i am asking
[01:04:34] <gyzmodo> markup same as example on the site
[01:04:54] <Woet> please make your code work on jsfiddle first, gyzmodo
[01:04:58] <Woet> hence a "live working demo"
[01:05:06] <Adman65> is there some way I can get the history state stack?
[01:05:09] <Skval> Hi guys, I'm having problem with the animate() method, When I run the following code:

[01:05:21] <Skval> The style changes are effective, the div is now displayed & with margin-top of 159px  but I just don't see any animation on the screen.
[01:05:21] <Skval> Does anyone has an idea of what got wrong?
[01:06:51] <Woet> ?demo @ Skval

[01:07:18] <Skval> Will do.
[01:07:54] <coldhead> good work Woet
[01:08:05] * Woet looks at coldhead
[01:08:15] <coldhead> when Woet is around i get another beer :)
[01:08:32] <coldhead> SCHOOLING THE NOOBS SINCE 1884
[01:08:46] <Woet> so i'll be responsible when you pass out on alcohol abuse?
[01:08:48] <Woet> if i'm around a lot.
[01:09:13] <coldhead> well beer stops me using heroin
[01:09:22] <coldhead> AT FIRST
[01:19:57] <gyzmodo> Woet, http://jsfiddle.net/2y8h2/1/
[01:19:59] <gyzmodo> look here
[01:20:25] <gyzmodo> when i load scripts from local machine, script doesnt work
[01:27:14] <gyzmodo> i've fixed problem
[01:28:53] <Woet> :)
[01:30:30] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/3xIoqbFN can someone help me with some transitions. each image is a different size, i want them to transition between the size instead of change suddenly. I think i need to change height and width?
[01:40:32] <Techdeck> hey guys, what do you recommend for checking whether the client is on a touch device? (i.e. smart phones, tablets etc)
[01:41:58] <coldhead> Rinthe: http://jsfiddle.net/SqmkE/1/
[01:42:16] <coldhead> i usually use absolute positioning and cross fading
[01:43:25] <Rinthe> coldhead: thanks! i'll check it out
[01:43:41] <coldhead> if you want to use ?animate // you can do the width height stuff you were talking about
[01:43:41] <bot-t1> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:43:49] <coldhead> but it's more gomblicated
[01:44:31] <coldhead> Techdeck: i think you're supposed to use media queries for that kind of thind?
[01:44:37] <coldhead> thing*
[01:44:42] <Techdeck> coldhead, what are media queries?
[01:45:13] <coldhead> Techdeck: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Media_queries#-moz-touch-enabled
[01:45:42] <Techdeck> that seems CSSish
[01:45:57] <Techdeck> I need a way to detect it from JS
[01:46:13] <coldhead> oh i se
[01:46:27] <Techdeck> I know there's $.browser -- but not sure that does what I need
[01:46:31] <Rinthe> coldhead: that's not what i'm looking for
[01:46:42] <Rinthe> coldhead: http://erichu.info/#120736/Moldar-Poster if you click the images
[01:46:50] <coldhead> then i have ventured all and failed
[01:46:51] <Rinthe> you'll see that the height of the image follows
[01:47:00] <Rinthe> coldhead: haha
[01:47:50] <Rinthe> thanks tho
[01:49:34] <coldhead> let me try something closer to that, Rinthe
[01:49:53] <Rinthe> coldhead: ok
[01:50:05] <Rinthe> coldhead: http://cargocollective.com/california#35337/Aerial-Studies-2 heres a better example
[01:50:05] <coldhead> how kind of you
[01:50:21] <Rinthe> coldhead: thanks :)
[02:14:08] <Kambfhase> anyone knowing how to make the explode effect working with position: absolute?
[02:14:14] <coldhead> sorry Rinthe, connection issues http://jsfiddle.net/SqmkE/2/
[02:15:06] <Rinthe> coldhead: oh np!
[02:15:25] <Rinthe> coldhead: I see all three images
[02:15:39] <coldhead> that ain't right
[02:16:07] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/SqmkE/3/
[02:16:32] <coldhead> er http://jsfiddle.net/SqmkE/5/
[02:16:38] <coldhead> that hides them initially in CSS
[02:16:43] <coldhead> which is more fool proof
[02:17:03] <Rinthe> okay
[02:17:26] <Rinthe> coldhead: that looks like it!
[02:17:31] <Rinthe> coldhead: thanks so much sir
[02:17:39] <coldhead> you're welcome
[02:21:08] <xover> Anyone know anything about the ._ui() method that ajpiano refers to here <http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide13>?
[02:21:36] <xover> Is it an actual jQuery UI method? Widget Factory method?
[02:21:58] <xover> Or is it just a suggested name for a method I should implement myself?
[02:22:18] <xover> (Google is so not being helpful with this)
[02:23:16] <coldhead> Techdeck: apparently the best way to test for touch is by using modernizr
[02:24:00] <Techdeck> hmm
[02:24:03] <Techdeck> ok, I'll try that, thank you
[02:24:28] <coldhead> then if ($('html').is('.touch') {alert)('houston we have a touch device');}
[02:24:55] <Techdeck> good idea.. I'll use it, sounds useful in other cases as well
[02:25:27] <coldhead> yes, we should all use it more often :)
[02:26:12] <Techdeck> I have another question for you, but this is a hard one
[02:27:03] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jQuery but let's hear it
[02:27:11] <Techdeck> oh in that case never mind
[02:27:14] <Kambfhase> yeah right
[02:27:17] <Techdeck> this is a really pain in the ass
[02:27:51] <coldhead> gross
[02:28:11] <Techdeck> $("</img>").attr("src", "http://some/image.png").load(function() { ... }); -- that should work everywhere right?
[02:28:18] <Techdeck> apparently not in IE when the image is cached :P
[02:28:28] <Techdeck> once the image is cached, it doesn't call the function in .load()
[02:28:35] <Kambfhase> try pusstin the loadd before the .attr
[02:28:40] <Kambfhase> *putting
[02:28:48] <Techdeck> Kambfhase, really?
[02:28:50] <Techdeck> lemme try
[02:29:02] <Techdeck> if that's it, I'm gonna send you beer
[02:31:03] <xover> Why is there not a Gratitude/Kudo Beer‚Ñ¢ clearing house for, uhm, ‚Äúmicropayments‚Äù?
[02:31:35] <Kambfhase> bitbeer
[02:33:26] <Techdeck> Kambfhase, I'd butt sex you right now
[02:33:33] <Techdeck> Kambfhase, how did you know that's the issue?
[02:33:36] <Techdeck> and what is the issue exactly?
[02:33:51] <Kambfhase> random guess. :o
[02:34:02] <Techdeck> do you understand why it happens?
[02:34:07] <xover> Yeha, there's allready sites ofr /that/, but I'm not sure it's as motivational for most people. :-)
[02:34:08] <Techdeck> ohhh
[02:34:12] <Kambfhase> well, you set the .attr and in that moment the .load event fires, because it is cached!
[02:34:15] <Techdeck> because it loads before I attach the event
[02:34:15] <Techdeck> doh
[02:34:21] <Techdeck> I love you
[02:34:23] <Techdeck> thank you very much man!!
[02:34:28] <Techdeck> this issue was driving me INSANE
[02:34:33] <coldhead> good work everyone!
[02:34:33] <Kambfhase> so after that you listen for the .load event but it does not know it has already been set off.
[02:34:56] <Kambfhase> ergo no handler execution
[02:34:56] <Techdeck> does that mean explorer runs better than the others? :P
[02:35:01] <Techdeck> cause it was working in them
[02:35:41] <Kambfhase> no, it shouldnt fire the event while other JS is running.
[02:35:49] <Kambfhase> looks like a bug to me
[02:37:07] <Kambfhase> oh yeah, you can stop humping me now.
[02:43:47] <Botanic> I am trying to return a jquery ui tab panel via an ajax function however the tab's do not work, when I include the tabpanel in the page itself it works fine. I assume there is a function I need to call manually but I dont know...
[02:44:34] <Botanic> http://codepad.org/tFdSpatq is what im returning
[02:45:49] <MrSamuel> Hi,
[02:45:56] <MrSamuel> I'm working on a very simple plugin for video and audio elements
[02:46:06] <MrSamuel> It synchronises events with the playback of the video
[02:46:31] <Rinthe> anyone know how i can make hash tags to be used with back and foward from the browser?
[02:46:38] <MrSamuel> I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions about how to integrate this with jQuery - e.g. in terms of the kind of API I should be aiming to create
[02:46:47] <coldhead> MrSamuel: have you seen popcorn.js ?
[02:46:50] <MrSamuel> Yeah
[02:47:01] <MrSamuel> But I already made my own one and I want to publish it
[02:47:04] <Kambfhase> ?bbq @ Rinthe
[02:47:04] <bot-t> Rinthe, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[02:47:38] <coldhead> i guess i would suggest you do what popcorn does :)
[02:47:54] <MrSamuel> coldhead: popcorn uses an object to manage the state of a single element
[02:48:11] <MrSamuel> but‚Ä¶ is this really in line with jQuery mode of interacting with elements and events?
[02:48:14] <coldhead> and yours supports multiple objects>
[02:48:19] <MrSamuel> yeah ideally
[02:48:21] <coldhead> ?
[02:48:25] <coldhead> cool!
[02:48:33] <MrSamuel> Well, event synchronisation is a separate part of the project
[02:48:50] <coldhead> popcorn is by a core jQuery developer, so i have faith that he is doing the right thing
[02:48:51] <MrSamuel> You can hook multiple audio and video streams into the EventPlayer object
[02:49:11] <MrSamuel> coldhead: After looking at popcorn I noticed that it doesn't seem to use jQuery though
[02:49:15] <coldhead> but i haven't had a good excuse to use it yet
[02:49:25] <MrSamuel> coldhead: it uses a single object to manage the state of a single video
[02:49:27] <coldhead> no it's probably platform independent
[02:49:41] <coldhead> in which case it would be cool if someone did a jQuery wrapper for popcorn
[02:49:54] <MrSamuel> coldhead: but what would the API look like
[02:50:05] <coldhead> ah this is your original question
[02:50:06] <MrSamuel> I mean, as soon as you write $('.foo') you are dealing with multiple objects
[02:50:30] <MrSamuel> yeah pretty much
[02:50:40] <coldhead> i;'m trying to think of a similar project you could borrow from
[02:50:40] <MrSamuel> I already wrote a proof of concept implementation a couple of months ago
[02:50:46] <MrSamuel> so the implementation works
[02:50:56] <MrSamuel> I just want to make a release on github
[02:51:03] <MrSamuel> but I want the code to work well and API to be nice
[02:51:17] <coldhead> MrSamuel: you might like to post on the jQuery forums for a more thoughtful answer
[02:51:46] <ravenzz> mh nice
[02:51:54] <coldhead> ajpiano and rwaldron would give you the benefit of their wisom there
[02:51:59] <MrSamuel> i see
[02:52:05] <MrSamuel> I might just have a stab at something
[02:52:10] <MrSamuel> =)
[02:52:20] <ravenzz> is it possible to read a txt file from the client side?
[02:52:21] <MrSamuel> it will be released under the MIT so anyone can improve it
[02:52:31] <ravenzz> popcorn.js could be usefull to add subtitles to videos
[02:52:57] <MrSamuel> ravenzz: yeah thats what I did with my proof of concept
[02:53:20] <ravenzz> i am interesting on it
[02:53:31] <ravenzz> what is your state of work?
[02:53:32] <MrSamuel> you are interested in my proof of concept?
[02:53:37] <MrSamuel> um, you can see a demo here
[02:53:46] <MrSamuel> http://www.kapahaka.org.nz/whaka-eke/index
[02:53:52] <MrSamuel> that is a pretty old example though
[02:53:59] <MrSamuel> but it will give you the general idea of how it works
[02:54:02] <MrSamuel> its really very simple
[02:54:12] <ravenzz> are you working with html5?
[02:54:28] <MrSamuel> yes
[02:55:14] <MrSamuel> would this be crappy jQuery syntax? var eventPlayer = $('.video').eventPlayer();
[02:55:31] <ravenzz> mh yea i see.. i need one for jw flv player, i could code it as well
[02:55:32] <MrSamuel> where eventPlayer is then used to add timed events to the playback of any of the selected elements?
[02:55:46] <MrSamuel> ravenzz: what is jw fly player?
[02:55:49] <MrSamuel> flv
[02:56:02] <ravenzz> a flash web player
[02:56:13] <MrSamuel> I see
[02:56:28] <iivvoo> I'm trying to implement modal-like behaviour
[02:56:35] <iivvoo> which means intercepting all / most events
[02:56:48] <iivvoo> is there a way to bind to all events somehow? For some reason, I can't get it to work
[02:56:59] <MrSamuel> ravenzz: what is different about jw fly player than other existing flash based players?
[02:58:02] <ravenzz> dunno, is like wmp vlc and winamp, they are different players ;)
[02:58:10] <ravenzz> i like jw
[02:58:22] <MrSamuel> i see cool
[02:59:01] <ravenzz> anyway i think that is impossible to read from a txt file
[02:59:04] <ravenzz> by js
[02:59:35] <MrSamuel> well you could pull the data using xmlhttprequest
[03:00:10] <ravenzz> yep, but that means that i need the server to spend resources
[03:01:01] <MrSamuel> what do you mean?
[03:01:14] <MrSamuel> the server is always going to have to spend resources to serve any kind of file
[03:01:20] <MrSamuel> where is the txt file stored?
[03:02:18] <ravenzz> no i need a page with the video playback
[03:02:52] <ravenzz> and the possibility of load subtitles
[03:03:09] <MrSamuel> why not embed the subtitles in the html?
[03:03:17] <MrSamuel> could that work?
[03:03:56] <ravenzz> i would allow the user to load Subtitles from his own pc
[03:04:02] <MrSamuel> i see
[03:04:08] <MrSamuel> yeah that could be hard from a browser
[03:04:08] <ravenzz> as a desktop player
[03:04:21] <ravenzz> i think that is not possible at all.
[03:05:22] <ravenzz> the subtitles file has to be uploaded
[03:05:54] <MrSamuel> i wonder if that could be a security risk
[03:06:19] <ravenzz> nah, if you parse it correctly
[03:43:13] <mndar> I want to disable search in jqGrid. Is that possible? I tried setting "search: false," for every column but that doesn't get rid of the 'Search' option at the bottom of the grid

[04:43:26] <bot-t> beilabs, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

[05:39:32] <jaypitidi> My site is using ajax navigation. When I try to implement my 5 star rating script that also uses an ajax request the page will refresh. Is there any way I can make an ajax request from inside a site that is loaded with ajax?
[05:48:35] <Woet> to answer your exact question
[05:48:36] <Woet> jaypitidi: yes.
[05:48:42] <Woet> is it a way
[05:48:45] <Woet> there is a way *
[05:48:52] <Woet> multiple ways even!
[05:48:57] <jaypitidi> How?
[05:49:03] <Woet> thought you might ask that
[05:49:09] <jaypitidi> When I try to do it, it will refresh the page
[05:49:14] <Woet> why is it relevant whether the content is loaded with ajax?
[05:49:19] <Woet> ?demo @ jaypitidi
[05:49:19] <jaypitidi> and I don't know if anything was sent to the servver
[05:49:22] <Woet> hmm
[05:49:27] <Woet> someone killed bot-t again
[05:49:38] <Woet> anywya
[05:49:40] <Woet> anyway
[05:49:46] <ipo> hi
[05:49:48] <Woet> jaypitidi: www.jsfiddle.net or a link to your site please
[05:49:56] <ipo> how to find is child with jquery?
[05:50:09] <Woet> ipo: what?
[05:50:25] <jaypitidi> http://lazywaycash.com/getpaid/surveys/#acop/
[05:50:39] <ipo> Woet, I have some li and ul , I want to know who is child!
[05:51:03] <jaypitidi> The other links you see on the left use iframes for the rating script and I am trying to find a way to not use them for seo reasons
[05:51:10] <jaypitidi> and others..
[05:51:40] <Woet> ipo: not making any sense, sorry
[05:52:06] <Woet> at least not to me :)
[05:52:19] <Woet> jaypitidi: they are a href's, hence the refresh of the page
[05:52:25] <ipo> Woet, no problem! I want to set parent width - 42 to children
[05:52:27] <Woet> jaypitidi: where is your code that turns the star rating into ajax?
[05:54:00] <jaypitidi> http://lazywaycash.com/php/rating.js
[05:54:20] <jaypitidi> or http://pastebin.com/nAZX80QH with that nice lil syntax highlighting
[05:55:43] <Woet> jaypitidi: okay, but that script is $(document).ready(function() {
[05:55:46] <Woet> which is before the content is loaded
[05:56:05] <Woet> so turn that into a function which is called: a) $(document).ready(function() { b) on success of your ajax loading content
[05:56:49] <jaypitidi> So I would put that in my main ajax navigation script?
[05:57:08] <Woet> jaypitidi: yes, you want it to turn the links into ajax when the content is loaded through ajax
[05:57:30] <jaypitidi> ok i'll give it a go
[05:57:48] * Woet looks at peol
[05:58:23] <Woet> yay jquery ui
[05:58:35] <Woet> yay bot-t
[05:58:37] * Woet hugs bot-t
[05:58:37] * bot-t hugs Woet back
[06:02:13] <jaypitidi> Hey you're awesome Woet
[06:02:17] <Woet> i know!
[06:03:11] <jaypitidi> http://pastebin.com/kigMfD1H
[06:03:16] <jaypitidi> it looks a lil funky but it works
[06:03:57] <jaypitidi> line 20 is where you can start
[06:04:08] <Woet> looks good
[06:04:13] <jaypitidi> thanks
[06:04:17] <Woet> you don't need $(document).ready(function() { in the callback of .load though
[06:04:17] <jaypitidi> for your help
[06:04:25] <jaypitidi> i didn't think so lo
[06:04:26] <jaypitidi> lol
[06:04:45] <jaypitidi> just a quick copy and paste to see what i would get
[06:04:56] <jaypitidi> yay no more iframes
[06:05:30] <Woet> shame on you for using them in the first place
[06:06:19] <jaypitidi> i know right? I had a lot of problems with cross domain, so I started using them before i did a permanent redirect
[06:06:25] <jaypitidi> no www in my address
[06:06:56] <Woet> why have the URL in your javascript in the first place?
[06:07:06] <Woet>  $.get("/php/rating.php" instead of  $.get("http://lazywaycash.com/php/rating.php" is a lot better
[06:07:30] <Woet> also supports domain changes without changing a million things
[06:07:41] <Woet> you can't do cross domain ajax anyways, so it won't break anything
[06:08:39] <jaypitidi> I had it relative before but some of my scripts and markup wasn't getting it. but then again this was before the redirect so i may try it again
[06:08:47] <kingmilo> hi guys.
[06:08:53] <ipo> how to make all li size 700 px?
[06:09:06] <jaypitidi> it's a site still in production so i haven't had a chance to optimize it really
[06:09:24] <kingmilo> How can I change the overall size of the jquery ui, I just want the whole ui to be a bit smaller, is there a quick way to achieve that?
[06:09:49] <jaypitidi> is that width or height jpo? I would think that is a css question anyways
[06:10:01] <jaypitidi> ipo
[06:10:17] <ipo> jaypitidi, ?
[06:10:32] <ipo> yes
[06:10:44] <jaypitidi> are you asking how to make all li elements a width or a height of 700px?
[06:10:49] <jaypitidi> which one?
[06:10:57] <ipo> jaypitidi, yes! this have some li and ul similar sub and sub
[06:11:09] <ipo> and now I want to set 700px with too all!
[06:11:20] <ipo> yes! all li
[06:11:20] <jaypitidi> you are trying to do this in jquery?
[06:11:30] <jaypitidi> .css()
[06:11:36] <jaypitidi> .attr()
[06:12:10] <ipo> yes
[06:12:13] <ipo> but cant!
[06:12:30] <jaypitidi> ('li').css('width', "700px")
[06:12:34] <jaypitidi> I think something like that
[06:13:01] <jaypitidi> don't ask why i'm using single and double quotes
[06:13:29] <ipo> you are right!
[06:13:47] <ipo> But my li style is this: (wait for showing image)
[06:14:18] <kingmilo> any ideas?
[06:14:21] <jaypitidi> I don't know what you are talking about. maybe you should paste your code in pastebin.com or show a link
[06:14:32] <ipo> yes! wait a sec
[06:27:25] <ipo> any body can help me?
[06:27:46] <ipo> I want to make my li like this picture!
[06:28:01] <ipo> http://morteza.asia/Screenshot.jpg
[06:28:23] <ipo> Woet, do you know?
[06:35:17] <ipo> Solved!
[06:35:18] <ipo> ;)
[07:13:10] <grid_> i use jquery ui dialog with containment in the body, can somebody help me to enable modal: true ? http://jsfiddle.net/bLJuj/
[07:23:29] <HS^> hi, i have a question about drag drop functionality.  there's a helper option in Draggable that i can set to a function..  i thought when i would now drop the item somewhere,  the item being placed in the container would be whatever is given back by the helper function
[07:23:49] <HS^> it will drag that item around.... that was returned by the helper function
[07:23:56] <HS^> but when dropped... the original is dropped
[07:24:19] <HS^> any idea why that is/
[07:38:49] <fotoflo> hmm, I'm getting some unexpected functionalty
[07:39:40] <fotoflo> var canvas = $("#myCanvas");  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");        Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'getContext'
[07:45:04] <fotoflo> can anyone suggest something fast? that works?
[07:45:36] <Haprog> try canvas = $("#myCanvas")[0]
[07:45:54] <Haprog> or just use document.getElementById('myCanvas') instead
[07:46:05] <fotoflo> why? whats up whith that?
[07:46:09] <fotoflo> http://ideone.com/Flbf4 btw
[07:46:31] <qvarkk> how can i select all tds inside a table that contains _only_ "x"?
[07:46:50] <qvarkk> $( 'td:contains("x")' ) doesn't do it
[07:48:23] <Haprog> fotoflo: jQuery object doesn't have a getContext method and using a jQuery selector you usually get an array of objects. you need the DOM node to call it's getContext method I guess.
[07:48:37] <Haprog> but I'm no expert
[07:51:28] <fotoflo> hmm
[07:51:30] <fotoflo> ok
[07:56:27] <misterm> qvarkk: I don't think there is a contains only selector
[07:56:39] <qvarkk> filter() did the trick
[07:56:39] <misterm> qvarkk: you might have to just iterate through them
[08:15:33] <Zxurian_> anyone here familiar with the jquery-File-Upload plugin?
[08:22:22] <mattt_> Are there any Java tools that'd make jquery-compatible XML responses out of java types and structures?
[08:23:11] <mattt_> And can jQuery transmit type information in an ajax request?
[08:24:02] <misterm> mattt_: what do you mean by "jquery-compatible"?
[08:24:14] <mattt_> Well, in a format jQuery expects
[08:24:32] <misterm> mattt_: a format it expects for what?
[08:24:49] <mattt_> Ah, is the XML interpretation up to the application?
[08:24:57] <misterm> mattt_: in terms of AJAX requests, it doesn't expect anything except it's valid
[08:25:06] <ErrorMcError> hey guess i was wondering if it is possible to submit the values of a table row to a mysql database, i cant seem to find any tutorials or articles on how to do so
[08:25:28] <misterm> mattt_: and jQuery can send whatever information you want in an AJAX request
[08:27:57] <HS^> hi, i have a draggable and a sortable.  and i drag the draggable into the sortable (with connectToSortable: "#sortable").  im ok so far.  but what i actually want to do is drop a custom helper in the sortable.
[08:27:59] <HS^> is that possible?
[08:28:34] <HS^> helper: test  , will show the custom helper will dragging......... but when dropped the original item is dropped
[08:32:47] <mattt_> Why does $.post() have a data type parameter?  Is that for the benefit of the developer/application, or does the api need to know something about the data returned from the server?
[08:33:19] <Superman_> guys any ideas. this page don't showing the clock all the time with my auctions
[08:33:20] <Superman_> http://auctions.hilotickets.com/index.php
[08:33:33] <Superman_> and often it needs a refresh
[08:33:41] <Superman_> when it doesn't comeup
[08:35:33] <HS^> i think there are here 800 people with questions lol.
[08:35:48] <ErrorMcError> ok so if i have a table with editable rows and i want to submit those values to a database after an edit has been made, would each row be its own form?
[08:47:38] <ryrych> hello hello
[08:48:19] <ryrych> how many of you, guys, are using vim to code in jQuery?
[08:48:42] <ryrych> I am interested in switching to it :)
[08:48:58] <Superman_> just code.. dont see where u r coding
[08:49:07] <Superman_> start it from notepad right now :p
[08:50:09] <ryrych> Superman_: I would like to know if it is comfortable to code in vim
[08:50:37] <Superman_> seriously this will waste your time. don't go for ide
[08:50:41] <Superman_> just code dude
[08:50:58] <Superman_> whatever is comfortable with you np++ or dreamweaver or wahteve
[08:51:19] <misterm> ryrych: the main consideration re IDE and jQuery is code completion
[08:51:20] <grid_> can anyone tell me why the scrollbars aren't working with chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/bLJuj/1/ they work with internet explorer and firefox, thnx
[08:51:23] <ryrych> Superman_ I do but I don‚Äôt find Komodo edit cool enough
[08:51:41] <misterm> ryrych: some libraries offer code completion for jQuery...if that's a feature you want, then consider that
[08:51:43] <Superman_> tip is this don't go for heavy ide
[08:51:51] <misterm> ryrych: but other than that, just fo for what you're comfortable with
[08:51:59] <misterm> ryrych: I like Komodo Edit a lot
[08:53:23] <ryrych> misterm: frankly I do not really know how Komodos completion for jQuery work :(
[08:53:55] <ryrych> more than often it does not catch up with new releases
[08:54:12] <ryrych> I mean api
[08:54:48] <misterm> ryrych: personally I don't really care about code completion for the jQuery API
[08:55:18] <ryrych> misterm: could you tell me what do you find attractive in Komodo when it comes to jQeury?
[08:55:31] <misterm> ryrych: I just want some minimal code completion based on what I am doing
[08:55:55] <misterm> ryrych: there's nothing about it that has anything to do with jQuery in particular
[08:56:23] <misterm> ryrych: that's what I was saying, really the only thing to think about editors/IDES in terms of jQuery is whether or not they have code completion for the IDE
[08:57:05] <misterm> I like Komodo Edit because it has good JS and Coffeescript support, you can write macros in Javascript/Python, it's based on the XUL platform so the plugin system is the same as Firefox
[08:57:21] <misterm> it's also very configurable and extensible
[08:57:53] <misterm> ryrych: but you should try a few and pick what you are comfortable with
[08:58:04] <misterm> ryrych: don't pick based on what you think is "cool"
[08:59:01] <mbutubuntu> hello everyboy
[08:59:07] <ryrych> misterm: the thing I like in Komodo is formatting of javascript that is superior to other editors
[09:00:01] <ryrych> misterm: but I have not found an edittor that is ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô with jQuery formatting guidelines
[09:00:05] <misterm> ryrych: yea, I've tried a lot of editors and I've found it just works well all around...and I've been using the 7 beta and it's even better
[09:00:20] <misterm> ryrych: I'm not sure what you mean
[09:01:00] <misterm> ryrych: the only thing in the jQuery style guidelines that I can think of that is not determined by you is the indenting and you can set that in Komodo
[09:01:02] <ryrych> misterm: jQuery devs published some time ago how they would like people to write in jQuery
[09:01:24] <misterm> ryrych: right, but besides indentation how is that related to the editor?
[09:01:31] <ggarri_> hi
[09:01:56] <ggarri_> why if I change the css propieties from javascript function of one element
[09:01:56] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, who us your code
[09:02:04] <mbutubuntu> *show us
[09:02:30] <ryrych> misterm: right, sorry, I should have said that others have problems with this formatting
[09:02:43] <ggarri_> http://pastebin.com/a8zCCBHY
[09:03:18] <ryrych> misterm: anyway I will give vim a try
[09:03:23] <ryrych> thank you
[09:04:21] <ggarri_> it is very strange
[09:04:33] <ggarri_> because the background works ok
[09:04:45] <ggarri_> but the font color stopping work
[09:05:13] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, you're setting style for ID, ul and li $('#page_menu ul li')
[09:05:32] <mbutubuntu> you should try setting it only to #page_menu
[09:05:38] <ggarri_> ul and li ?
[09:05:53] <ggarri_> ahhh
[09:05:53] <ggarri_> ok
[09:06:06] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, and then why do you set css two times?
[09:06:34] <ggarri_> because I want to change with click event
[09:06:37] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, it's unuseful.. what you do it: setting a style, then replacing it
[09:06:53] <ggarri_> I didn't replace it
[09:07:10] <ggarri_> I change only the font color when the menu is selected
[09:07:21] <mbutubuntu> I see $('#page_menu ul li').css and then $(this).css, but $(this) is the clicked obj
[09:07:40] <mbutubuntu> and the clicked obj is $('#page_menu ul li')
[09:08:11] <mbutubuntu> so you apply two different styles to the same element twice...
[09:08:28] <ggarri_> wait
[09:08:32] <ggarri_> ok, it is true
[09:08:57] <ggarri_> because firstly I change all the menu to initial state( initial style)
[09:09:07] <ggarri_> and after I change the element clicked
[09:09:45] <mbutubuntu> initial state should exist yet...
[09:10:08] <ggarri_> and how I can reset it ?
[09:10:38] <ggarri_> if I want to come back to the initial css style, are there any way ?
[09:11:46] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, are you using classes? what is #page_menu? a single button or the entire menu block?
[09:12:18] <ggarri_> menu block
[09:12:54] <mbutubuntu> so why you want to change aspect of a menu block? I think you should change the aspect of the single button.. do you?
[09:13:33] <ggarri_> yes
[09:13:37] <ggarri_> look at here
[09:13:37] <ggarri_> http://pastebin.com/W7Dwt0BP
[09:13:48] <ggarri_> I uploaded css, html and jquery
[09:13:58] <mbutubuntu> so you shouldn't binding a click event on the entire menu block...
[09:15:02] <ggarri_> what?
[09:15:15] <ggarri_> I didnt understand
[09:15:26] <ggarri_> ahhh, ok
[09:15:51] <HS^> hi, i have a draggable and a sortable.  and i drag the draggable into the sortable (with connectToSortable: "#sortable").  im ok so far.  but what i actually want to do is drop a custom helper in the sortable.
[09:15:52] <ggarri_> I want to change only one element which belongs menu block
[09:16:56] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, you should use classes... for example $('.button').click(function(){$('.button').css(resetCss); $(this).css(clickedCss);});
[09:17:21] <mbutubuntu> where resetCss and clickedCss are css objects
[09:18:14] <mbutubuntu> you could use also use $(li) but if there are other <li> in the page you'll have problems... so classes can help you
[09:18:36] <ggarri_> ok
[09:18:46] <ggarri_> but my main problem is with the hover event
[09:18:53] <ggarri_> not with the normal style
[09:19:13] <ggarri_> can I select the hover style also through jquery ?
[09:19:22] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, sure....
[09:19:32] <mbutubuntu> $("id:hover")
[09:19:42] <ggarri_> ok
[09:19:44] <ggarri_> thx
[09:19:48] <ggarri_> I will
[09:19:48] <ggarri_> xD
[09:20:01] <mbutubuntu> !selectors
[09:20:23] <ravenzz> ?selectors
[09:20:24] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1ñ3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[09:20:27] <ravenzz> :]
[09:20:37] <mbutubuntu> ravenzz, thanks
[09:20:52] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, I've a doubt on the last question...
[09:21:11] <ggarri_> which ?
[09:21:31] <ggarri_> just I want to select the style on hover event using jquery
[09:22:15] <innociv_> I'm having a lot of trouble finding a javascript bbcode parser that actually works :/  I've tried http://blogs.stonesteps.ca/showpost.aspx?pid=33  http://code.google.com/p/bbcodejs/ and one other I can't locate.  The most complicated one was buggy, the simple ones don't do things like [color="#hex"]text[/color]
[09:22:47] <innociv_> Hm think i might have actually found one
[09:23:40] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, about the :hover pseudoSelector
[09:24:28] <ggarri_> what do you want to know ?
[09:24:53] <HS^> when i do this ui.draggable.empty();
[09:25:03] <HS^> why is there still style left in that draggable?
[09:25:11] <HS^> the border of draggable is stll there.
[09:25:19] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, :hover isn't usable as a selector
[09:25:36] <ggarri_> ok
[09:25:42] <ggarri_> then ?
[09:25:46] <mbutubuntu> but you can use classes...
[09:26:13] <ggarri_> but can I use $(.button:hover).css(...) ?
[09:26:34] <mbutubuntu> for example you could use two classes in css both with :hover; then add a class when clicked and remove when unclicked
[09:28:06] <ggarri_> ok
[09:28:20] <ggarri_> the problem is incompatibility
[09:28:26] <ggarri_> but I can't find it
[09:28:33] <ggarri_> I will do something different
[09:28:38] <ggarri_> because I am tired
[09:28:44] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, incompatibility?
[09:28:45] <ggarri_> I was long time with this
[09:28:47] <ggarri_> yes
[09:28:59] <ggarri_> because hover event works correctly
[09:29:12] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, you can also use .hover()
[09:29:13] <ggarri_> just the font color stop to work in hover
[09:29:16] <hacksparrow> Guys, know of any js lib to convert time from one timezone to another?
[09:29:24] <ggarri_> I will try that
[09:29:30] <ggarri_> It is easier
[09:32:13] <mbutubuntu> hacksparrow, no, but you can use .getTimezoneOffset()
[09:33:20] <mbutubuntu> it gives you the offset in minutes from UTC... than you can do some stuff for conversion
[09:33:26] <mbutubuntu> *then
[09:33:37] <HS^> jquery gives me headpain
[09:34:33] <xec> HS^: have you tried plain javascript? :)
[09:34:48] <HS^> i try to do drag and drop..
[09:34:54] <HS^> cant do it with that
[09:34:59] <ggarri_> can I do that $(this).css('buttonMenu2');ø?
[09:35:05] <xec> hehe, of course you can
[09:35:05] <mbutubuntu> xec, :-)
[09:35:11] <HS^> no.....
[09:35:18] <HS^> i m busy all day with this stupid thing
[09:35:21] <xec> HS^: well, jquery IS javascript
[09:35:26] <HS^> yes
[09:35:28] <HS^> i hate it :/
[09:35:45] <xec> HS^: so anything jquery can do, it can do because javascript can do it
[09:35:48] <grid_> can anyone tell me why the scrollbars aren't working with chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/bLJuj/1/ they work with internet explorer and firefox, thnx
[09:35:51] <mbutubuntu> xec, are you sure ggarri_ can? buttonMenu2 is a string....
[09:36:11] <HS^> xecdo you know anythng about jquery drag drop
[09:36:12] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, do you mean how to add a class to an element?
[09:36:14] <xec> mbutubuntu: i was replying to HS^,
[09:36:21] <ggarri_> was a question
[09:36:28] <ggarri_> I did fail
[09:36:28] <mbutubuntu> xec, ok... :-P
[09:37:10] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, you can't... css wants objects...
[09:37:30] <mbutubuntu> HS^, why do you hate jq ?
[09:37:44] <ggarri_> what you mean ?
[09:37:46] <ggarri_> with object
[09:38:30] <mbutubuntu> ggarri_, you used it... var cssObj = {"color": "#ffffff", "background": "#000000"};
[09:38:49] <mbutubuntu> cssObj is an object.....
[09:39:07] <mbutubuntu> Obj should be clear :-P
[09:39:19] <HS^> mbutubuntu it doesnt do what i want
[09:39:35] <mbutubuntu> HS^, what do you want from jq?
[09:40:02] <HS^> drag and drop... i have it all working ,  except i want to drop the helper
[09:40:03] <mbutubuntu> jq is wonderful for many stuffs
[09:40:12] <HS^> so with the helper it will show that div when dragging...
[09:40:16] <HS^> but it wont drop it
[09:40:17] <mbutubuntu> HS^, are u using jquery-ui?
[09:40:22] <HS^> yes
[09:40:52] <mbutubuntu> HS^, you should say: you don't do what you want... :-P
[09:41:00] <mbutubuntu> I used drag&drop and it's fine
[09:41:01] <HS^> ?
[09:41:21] <HS^> i want to do it a bit more complex
[09:41:43] <HS^> i want to drag a draggable...... into a sortable......  and actually drop the helper of the draggable
[09:41:48] <HS^> if that makes any sense to you.
[09:42:19] <mbutubuntu> HS^, yes it makes sense...
[09:42:41] <HS^> look at this
[09:42:54] <HS^> this is what i took: http://www.mccran.co.uk/examples/jquery-multi-drag-drop/
[09:42:56] <HS^> it works fine
[09:43:45] <HS^> but now i want to drop something else, for example.. when i drag bread ... i want to actually drag and drop another div (a helper)
[09:44:17] <HS^> think of it like left a menu.  rightside the actual items
[09:44:19] <yannj> Hello, I need to load multiline data from XML, is there a way to use .text and preserve the multiline? I did replace('\r\n','<br>') but <br> is display instead of breaking line
[09:44:26] <HS^> thats what i try to do
[09:44:35] <HS^> but jquery is not build for it... so i have headpain.
[09:45:48] <mbutubuntu> HS^, you'll win against jquery...
[09:46:29] <HS^> i tried every other drag drop library also
[09:46:36] <HS^> scriptaculous or something
[09:47:24] <HS^> im going for a walk.
[09:47:55] <mbutubuntu> HS^, so you need to drag another element that is a sort of "mirror" of the selected element?
[09:48:19] <mbutubuntu> HS^, so you don't want to see bread dragging?...
[09:51:58] <K1ng> !up
[09:52:04] <K1ng> !up http://k1ng.php-dev.net/
[09:57:18] <Woet> K1ng: it's up.
[09:57:21] <Woet> slow, but up.
[09:57:29] <K1ng> thanks :)
[09:58:04] <K1ng> Woet, my computer connected to two slow ass internet
[09:58:16] <Woet> that's probably why people invented datacenters
[09:58:40] <woopwoop> hey, how would I go about adding a border to an image after it's been clicked on? bind a click event? but if i were to click on another image i'd want the same action on that but how would i get it to automatically unbind on the prev image?
[09:58:52] <Woet> woopwoop: docs?
[09:58:53] <K1ng> well yes, that is not for website, its just for showing things to my client
[09:59:13] <Woet> woopwoop: read the documentation, use google, try it out at www.jsfiddle.net and post a link when you're stuck
[09:59:27] <Woet> we'll repeat that process until you got working code and learned a lot
[09:59:28] <Woet> :)
[09:59:59] <K1ng> jquery is way better than pure javascript :p
[10:00:22] <Woet> the effect on your website is way too slow K1ng
[10:00:27] <Woet> makes people click away
[10:00:32] <dabear> woopwoop: add an event listener to all images. save the last clicked image in a variable. unset any border of that variable, and apply new border to currently clicked element
[10:00:33] <woopwoop> i have read the docs, i just wanna make sure it's on the right track and if its even possible
[10:00:49] <Woet> woopwoop: everything is possible.
[10:00:54] <K1ng> Woet, really slow?
[10:01:07] <Woet> K1ng: as in, i click on 'contact' and the entire effect takes 7 seconds
[10:01:20] <woopwoop> thanks dabear
[10:01:29] <Woet> you're welcome too woopwoop
[10:01:32] <K1ng> nope
[10:01:36] <K1ng> 4 sec
[10:02:12] <Woet> K1ng: 6.32 sec, i just timed it
[10:02:13] <woopwoop> thanks for the wisdom woet
[10:02:29] <Woet> K1ng: from 'about me' to 'contact' and being able to enter something
[10:02:46] <K1ng> :P
[10:02:57] <Woet> i would click away if i was interested
[10:04:12] <Guest32499> K1ng: ah, we meet again
[10:04:17] <k1t> muahaa
[10:04:23] <k1t> =x
[10:04:25] <K1ng> oh hey mate :P
[10:04:29] <k1t> how's it going? :)
[10:04:55] <K1ng> bad :(
[10:05:02] <K1ng> i only made 2k this month
[10:09:32] <k1t> :(
[10:09:45] <k1t> just got a check from Evernote, not doin too bad here lol
[10:09:52] <k1t> =x
[10:09:54] <k1t> jk
[10:12:23] <yannj> Hello, I need to load multiline data from XML, is there a way to use .text and preserve the multiline? I did replace('\r\n','<br>') but <br> is display instead of breaking line
[10:12:49] <intellilogic> k1t, you prog for evernote?
[10:13:16] <k1t> i was subcontracted to work on an app for them
[10:13:26] <k1t> indirectly
[10:13:26] <k1t> lol
[10:13:29] <intellilogic> Cool
[10:13:33] <dabear> yannj: you cannot use .text and expect any formatting (like tags) to work
[10:13:34] <intellilogic> still cool
[10:13:42] <k1t> :]
[10:13:48] <dabear> yannj: see ?html for that
[10:13:48] <bot-t> yannj, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[10:14:02] <yannj> dabear: ok I'll try
[10:19:27] <yannj> dabear: works well
[10:27:36] <danzik17> Random question about the jquery source if someone knows - why in some places is something like $.each('one two three'.split(' '), ... used rather than just passing in ['one', 'two', 'three' ]?
[10:40:26] <bobbobbins> hey all...is there some sort of jquery plugin that will make sure users input a date into a text field in a certain format? I'm aware of datepicker, but i didn't want to use the popup calendar thing
[10:41:15] <fris> bobbobbins i love this one http://www.datejs.com/
[10:42:04] <bobbobbins> fris, perfect thanks
[10:55:29] * gjvc watches the yayquery podcasts
[11:02:53] <grid_> can anyone tell me why the scrollbars aren't working with chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/bLJuj/1/ they work with internet explorer and firefox, thnx
[11:15:27] <Woet> grid_: which scrollbars won't work?
[11:16:09] <johnline3> get out woet
[11:16:23] <johnline3> :v
[11:16:54] <Woet> [20:16:28] ‚Üê johnline3 left the channel.
[11:16:55] <Woet> irony
[11:19:25] <error4o4>  is it possible to dynamically load an external javascript file inside some DOM element.  Trying  to load Facebook Like button, google+  etc. after the whole page has completely loaded
[11:20:49] <Woet> .getScript, error4o4
[11:21:03] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[11:21:18] <error4o4> Woet: yea but i need somehow to put that code inside some Dom element, because the buttons show where the script is
[11:21:31] <Woet> $("#element").getScript doesn't work?
[11:21:40] <Woet> also, they both have an API
[11:21:57] <error4o4> Woet: that one did not came to my mind
[11:22:07] <Woet> im not sure whether it works, but its worth a try
[11:22:16] <Woet> anyways, i personally did it differently
[11:22:44] <error4o4> what approach did you choose.. the problem is that sometimes those external JS files slow down the website
[11:23:07] <Woet> i used the <fb:like> tag
[11:23:14] <Woet> and then loaded the facebook javascript later asynchronisally
[11:23:21] <Woet> it rewrites those tags
[11:23:36] <Woet> it's the 'xfbml' checkbox on the like button generator
[11:23:54] <error4o4> Woet: yea, google+ and facebook support that, need to check if linkedin has this feature
[11:24:02] <Woet> and for google +1 you can pass parsetags: 'explicit' to it
[11:24:13] <Woet> and then use gapi.plusone.render
[11:24:30] <error4o4> Woet: thanks
[11:24:36] <Woet> not sure for linkedin
[11:24:44] <Woet> isn't it just a static image for linkedin?
[11:25:05] <Woet> oh, i see
[11:25:08] <error4o4> Woet: no, it loads ext. js and shares the url
[11:44:01] <Skizu> Hi, say I've a normal html form how can I submit it to the server ._.
[11:45:25] <Kambfhase> .submit() ?
[12:38:20] <guy> just thinking of a web concept & wondering whether that'd be possible
[12:44:24] <daniele> hello. I'm looking for a library for parsing date times in "natural language" form. datejs looks nice but development seems halted
[12:44:42] <daniele> some other option?
[12:47:32] <abjorn> yeah its
[12:47:32] <abjorn> very
[12:47:33] <abjorn> VERY
[12:47:35] <abjorn> halted lol
[12:47:49] <abjorn> Fairly sure it was abandoned or somethign
[12:50:29] <mbutubuntu> hello folks
[12:50:49] <daniele> abjorn: i hope someone will pick up the project
[12:51:45] <abjorn> meh, it's easy enough to roll your own tbh
[12:52:04] <abjorn> afaik there aren't any stand alone libraries that are particularly mature for that sort of thign
[12:52:15] <mbutubuntu> daniele, abjorn what project?
[12:52:37] <daniele> mbutubuntu: datejs
[12:52:55] <Kambfhase> maybe https://github.com/jquery/globalize is what you want
[12:53:36] <abjorn> nah, datejs, what he was looking at is more like
[12:53:43] <abjorn> "oh this date should be 'tomorrow'"
[12:54:03] <abjorn> or "last March" or "a few seconds ago" etc etc
[12:54:05] <abjorn> that sort of thign
[12:54:12] <Kambfhase> ah, kk
[12:55:12] <abjorn> but really you could just fork datejs
[12:55:17] <abjorn> it mostly works
[12:55:26] <abjorn> it'll probably do what you want
[12:56:11] <abjorn> (although tbh it's *really* bloated, so I'd rather write my own from scratch)
[12:58:54] <daniele> abjorn: i would not define this kind of problem "simple"
[12:59:59] <daniele> abjorn: it is quite contrived to make it work in the reasonable cases and fail reasonably in the other
[13:01:33] <abjorn> well what exactly are you trying to do
[13:18:06] <chachan> guys, I'm trying to understand how they can make the hover effect in this page: http://goo.gl/EfQXv
[13:19:30] <chachan> I can do everything but I can't figure out how to put divs at the backend without using z-index, any idea?
[13:19:35] <peol> chachan: probably just a wrapper div, two absolute-positioned elements inside and you animate the second one with your desired effect
[13:19:38] <peol> check the source
[13:19:54] <chachan> peol, I'm checking the source but I don't get that part
[13:20:05] <ravenzz> chachan http://buildinternet.com/2009/03/sliding-boxes-and-captions-with-jquery/ LOL
[13:20:11] <grid_> just find something with a hover effect on github, it has lots of plugins, did you already try?
[13:20:13] <mbutubuntu> chachan, there are probalby 3 elements
[13:20:26] <ravenzz> "This is the Live Demo
[13:20:26] <ravenzz> Go back to the tutorial for a full explanation of what's going on!
[13:20:27] <ravenzz> "
[13:20:47] <mbutubuntu> the hover is applied to a not-visible not-animated div... in the upfront
[13:21:24] <mbutubuntu> the hover on the element makes children's animations
[13:21:30] <grid_> but guys, i already try for this whole day to figure out howto avoid that the scrollbars aren't working with this jquery dialog, i use containment with modal effect, http://jsfiddle.net/bLJuj/1/ can anyone take a look at it?
[13:21:43] <chachan> hm, thanks guys, I will check it out :)
[13:21:44] <grid_> scrolling works ok with ie and firefox
[13:21:53] <grid_> is it something small?
[13:21:59] <grid_> or a webkit bug?
[13:22:22] <peol> grid_: what? it's working here, in chrome
[13:22:28] <mbutubuntu> chachan, something like <a><b><c></c></b></a>... the a is the main-parent element
[13:22:30] <peol> drag+scroll that is
[13:22:54] <grid_> peol: try to scroll down with your mouse button on the scrollbar, it isn't working with chrome
[13:22:56] <peol> mbutubuntu: it's all explained it the link ravenzz posted
[13:23:05] <ravenzz> grid_ the same here
[13:23:05] <mbutubuntu> peol, aah ok...
[13:23:23] <peol> grid_: i'm on trackpad only
[13:23:34] <grid_> ravenzz: it only scrolls down with the dialog here, not with a mouse press on the scrollbar
[13:23:45] <grid_> ravenzz: do you use chrome?
[13:23:57] <mbutubuntu> peol, it's what i thought...
[13:24:10] <grid_> it didn't scroll with chrome at someone else his computer too (chrome)
[13:25:04] <mbutubuntu> grid_, do you need that the scroll moves when dialog goes out the container?
[13:25:14] <mbutubuntu> or you don't want this?
[13:25:29] <ravenzz> grid_ no wait, i notice the same problem now
[13:25:38] <peol> grid_: yeah, it's not working when trying to drag the scroll indicators
[13:25:46] <grid_> mbutubuntu: in my intention it does that already, i want it to scroll normal, like when you scroll in a webpage
[13:25:54] <skypce> guys, can you helpme please
[13:26:04] <skypce> i need change the color of a placeholder
[13:26:14] <skypce> $(document).ready(function(){
[13:26:14] <skypce>   $('#search input:text').autofill({
[13:26:14] <skypce>     value: "Search..."
[13:26:14] <skypce>   }).css('color:#000')
[13:26:14] <skypce> });
[13:26:21] <peol> skypce: ?paste
[13:26:26] <peol> ?paste
[13:26:26] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:26:42] <peol> ? css @ skypce
[13:26:42] <bot-t> skypce, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:26:49] <mbutubuntu> skypce, .css("color", "#value")
[13:26:50] <grid_> ravenzz: ok, do you think it's something that is easy to fix?
[13:26:52] <peol> read the api
[13:27:07] <skypce> thank you very much guys,
[13:27:27] <grid_> ravenzz: just need the containment option with jquery dialog here, so it should scroll atleast
[13:27:35] <grid_> with modal true
[13:28:09] <skypce> that have a good day ;D
[13:28:10] <peol> grid_: a modal should lock the scrolling fully afaik, it's a what a modal (usually) do
[13:28:43] <grid_> peol: well, it will scroll if you implement jquery ui dialog the normal way
[13:29:29] <peol> grid_: yeah, because that's a dialog :)
[13:29:37] <peol> not a modal
[13:29:42] <grid_> isnt this also a dialog? :)
[13:30:21] <peol> grid_: "If set to true, the dialog will have modal behavior; other items on the page will be disabled (i.e. cannot be interacted with). Modal dialogs create an overlay below the dialog but above other page elements."
[13:30:25] <peol> from the docs
[13:30:37] <Techdeck> who killed ajpiano and why? :(
[13:30:44] <grid_> peol: yeah i know
[13:30:46] <peol> Techdeck: he's traveling this weekend
[13:30:56] <Techdeck> ahhh
[13:31:02] <Techdeck> how dare he travel
[13:31:10] <Techdeck> what will the jquery community do :P
[13:31:13] <grid_> peol: can we activate the scrollbars again with chrome on some way?
[13:31:21] <guy> I found a bug in jQuery, if anyone is interested.. it is pretty basic. See the demo. http://anuary.com/?preview=true The bug is in $('div.page').animate({ padding: 6 }); so, I'd expect the animation to decrease the size of padding from present value (20px) to 6px. However, it doesn't animate, and change change the value to 6.
[13:32:06] <peol> grid_: yeah, that part def. sounds like a bug, i haven't used the ui lib that much, but it should work consistently (i.e., scrolling (not) work x-browser)
[13:32:23] <peol> grid_: you could probably patch it if you find the culprit
[13:32:49] <grid_> yeah, but the fact is, containment is not a feature with jquery ui dialog, so there is no bug support (yet)
[13:33:34] <interopcop> I have a rails site using jquery - on a particular page I would like to show the status of a process, like a wizard [stage1] >> [stage2] >> [stage3] where each stage is a div.  Do I fade stage1 to highlight stage 2 using fadeTo(), or is that bad form?
[13:33:35] <grid_> but i get bugs when i use the normal ui dialog on ie8, it will be dragged besides the edges of the browser, that's why i want containment (i use dynamic background plugins)
[13:33:45] <interopcop> it's a static page, not a form
[13:33:46] <grid_> the background will become smaller
[13:33:49] <peol> grid_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L697 it's probably around that line
[13:33:54] <grid_> so i want containment so it will not effect anything
[13:34:34] <grid_> it's not always a good idea to change the source of a plugin :)
[13:34:38] <peol> and you could unobtrusively change that behavior by extending it (easier to remove the workaround when updating to a fixed version). also, please report this as a bug so it can get fixed
[13:35:18] <grid_> well, as long containment is not a feature with jquery ui dialog, i think they will not report it like a bug
[13:35:42] <grid_> or they will not search for a workarround
[13:36:05] <grid_> they could better make a workarround with ie8 and jquery ui dialog, so it won't drag behind the edges of the browser
[13:36:19] <grid_> this will mess up other things on my site
[13:36:40] <peol> grid_: true, but this is not the expected behavior since it isn't cross-browser consistent, so it should be looked into if it's not a bug in chrome 13 specifically and will get fixed
[13:36:44] <grid_> look here http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/5651/screenyo.jpg
[13:36:50] <grid_> you see the dialog?
[13:37:45] <grid_> that's with ie8, but it's not a big problem, but the problem is, all background will become smaller (atleast background that will load dynamically from atleast 8 jquery plugins that i could find on github)
[13:37:51] <grid_> so i see it as a big bug :)
[13:38:22] <peol> grid_: you might want to discuss this with the devs, check if someone's awake in #jqueryui-dev
[13:38:40] <peol> or make a post on the forums
[13:38:51] <grid_> yeah, thats probably a workarround for it
[13:40:44] <ravenzz> grid_ you could set the modal property to false, and implement the overlay by yourself
[13:41:32] <grid_> ravenzz: yeah, i did read something about this solutions somewhere
[13:45:19] <grid_> ravenzz: but do you have a suggestion for the overlay? where should i start with?
[13:48:11] <peol> grid_: use the dialog events, create your own overlay on 'dialogopen' and remove it with 'dialogclose'
[13:48:42] <peol> s/with/on
[13:49:17] <grid_> i know about the options, i already use them, i could bind it to a function i already use with dialogopen and dialogclose, but the new overlay you get also from jquery ui dialog?
[13:51:00] <Rinthe> why doesn't this work? http://codepad.org/vbZvz8SQ
[13:51:12] <ravenzz> grid_ http://jsfiddle.net/jHkSW/
[13:51:16] <Rinthe> i made one for this is the key "k" i made one for "j" and it works
[13:51:52] <ravenzz> also i would change the dialog's position attribute from absolute to fixed
[13:52:36] <Rinthe> is there something special about the letter K
[13:53:00] <Rinthe> nm.
[13:57:28] <grid_> ravenzz: i will use your workaround, sure
[13:57:36] <grid_> will change it to fixed instead
[14:05:03] <skypce> <skypce> hi again guys, i have another problem
[14:05:03] <skypce> <skypce> $(document).ready(function(){
[14:05:03] <skypce> <skypce>   $('#search input:text').autofill({
[14:05:03] <skypce> <skypce>     value: "City Search"
[14:05:03] <skypce> <skypce>   }).css({color:'#807F7F',margin:'0 auto'})
[14:05:04] <skypce> <skypce> });
[14:05:15] <skypce>  when i do a focus without element and again do a focus into element the css properties doesnt work
[14:05:26] <skypce> can you helpme please, maybe have some like a refresh or update
[14:05:26] <skypce> <skypce> ?
[14:07:03] <Offlein> I'm looking at code wherein they do: $item.toggle(function() { // stuff }, function() { //stuff });
[14:07:16] <Offlein> Isn't toggle just to make things disappear and reappear? Are they rebinding it or something?
[14:08:18] <peol> Offlein: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[14:08:26] <dabear> Offlein: it has multiple uses. called as in your example there, it will cycle through different functions for every other click
[14:08:35] <Offlein> Ah, I see there's an event and  an effect!!
[14:09:39] <Offlein> so that leads into my next question, which is that if the toggle event triggers alternate things (in my example, it is triggering an "expand" method or a "collapse" method, is there any way to retain the original click?
[14:09:58] <Offlein> Basically since this is rebound, child elements are not registering the click() event as normal
[14:10:45] <dumbyAtJS> I have a rookie question
[14:11:38] <HS^> hi. drag drop question. dropping a helper on a sortable. is it \possible?
[14:11:40] <dumbyAtJS> how do it iterate over an array of 4 strings, and create 4 new objects referenced with the array's strings with a for loop
[14:14:58] <Rinthe> is there a count function in jquery?
[14:15:11] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: what do you mean by "object referenced with a string"?
[14:15:41] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: do you mean you have an array of strings that you want to turn into property names in an object?
[14:16:07] <dumbyAtJS> <misterm>
[14:16:11] <dumbyAtJS> yes!!!!
[14:17:48] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: var my_object = {}, key; for ( var i = 0, l = the_array.length; i < l; i++) { key = the_array[ i ]; my_object[ key ] = []; }
[14:18:23] <misterm> or {} or whatever you want to put into the object
[14:18:38] <Rinthe> is there a count function in jquery?
[14:18:47] <misterm> Rinthe: to count what?
[14:18:51] <dumbyAtJS> <minsterm> here is what my mind is thinking http://pastie.org/2408256
[14:19:08] <dumbyAtJS> as i'm looking at ur code...i see i'm thinking about this wrong
[14:19:28] <Rinthe> misterm: count the number of $('.images')
[14:19:45] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: you don't need to do new Object(), just do {}
[14:20:00] <misterm> Rinthe: ?length
[14:20:20] <dumbyAtJS> can i set the var to arr[i] as it goes through the string names?
[14:21:00] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: I'm not sure what you mean
[14:21:17] <dumbyAtJS> i don't understand {}
[14:21:38] <dumbyAtJS> i wanna pull the string names out of the array and turn them into variables
[14:21:47] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: {} creates a new object
[14:22:03] <dumbyAtJS> basically set 4 vars with a for loop with the names of the array's
[14:22:23] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: you can't really do that in JS without using something like eval and you don't want to do that
[14:22:38] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: what you want to do is create an object to hold the data you want
[14:22:42] <dumbyAtJS> why do i always do javascript WRONG!
[14:22:44] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: and use the strings as property names
[14:24:11] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: see how when you make an array, you didn't do "new Array()"?
[14:24:19] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: you just used [] and put stuff in it?
[14:24:27] <dumbyAtJS> yes sir
[14:24:29] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: {} is the same, except it makes an object
[14:24:50] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: if you do var foo = {}   ... foo now holds an object
[14:25:18] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: var foo = {"blue" : 123} ...holds an object with a "blue" property
[14:25:33] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: and you can do foo.blue to get 123
[14:25:42] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: or you can do foo["blue"]
[14:25:55] <misterm> dumbyAtJS: or even var x = "blue"; foo[x]
[14:28:03] <HS^> hi. drag drop question. dropping a helper on a sortable. is it \possible?
[14:29:31] <Kambfhase> HS^: you can drop a droppable on a sortable, yes
[14:31:39] <dumbyAtJS> i don't like that i can write js how i think
[14:32:11] <dumbyAtJS> i have an array with strings in it, and i want to write a for loop that takes the string values and turns them into objects
[14:32:15] <dumbyAtJS> why????
[14:32:40] <Kambfhase> why would you want to turn strings into objects?
[14:32:47] <HS^> Kambfhase yes but i mean the helper
[14:32:55] <Kambfhase> helper? dunno
[14:33:02] <HS^> Kambfhase imagine leftside is a menu, right side "items" ...
[14:33:23] <HS^> i need a user to drag a menu item but it will drop an actual 'item'
[14:34:21] <Kambfhase> well you could use reveter:true and on drop append a new item and the place the helper was dropped
[14:34:26] <Kambfhase> *revert
[14:34:39] <danzik17> misterm:  Why would you need to use eval to accomplish what he's trying to do?
[14:34:52] <HS^> Kambfhase and how would you do that
[14:34:59] <misterm> danzik17: what do you mean?
[14:35:28] <danzik17> misterm: He wants to create 4 new objects with the name of 4 strings in a given Array - why would you need eval for that?
[14:35:56] <misterm> danzik17: did you miss the part where he said he wanted them to be variables?
[14:36:23] <danzik17> misterm: No.  Given string 'foo', he wants an equivalent 'var foo' unless I'm misunderstanding.
[14:36:46] <misterm> danzik17: yea, and how would you do that without something like eval?
[14:37:19] <danzik17> $.each([ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz'], function() { window[this] = {}; });
[14:37:43] <misterm> danzik17: you don't want to stick things in the global scope like that
[14:37:45] <woopwoop> hey - so I have a div with like 50 images, is there anyway I can get its currnt (count) position relative to the total amount of images when I click on it? is there such a function?
[14:37:52] <misterm> danzik17: other than that, that's the same solution I gave him
[14:37:53] <Kambfhase> HS^: http://jsbin.com/inazeg/edit#javascript,html
[14:38:03] <danzik17> misterm:  I agree.  Nothing is stopping him from creating a container object within a function though.
[14:38:08] <tbranyen> ?index @ woopwoop
[14:38:08] <bot-t> woopwoop, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[14:38:15] <misterm> danzik17: yea, and that's what I told him he could do
[14:38:21] <woopwoop> ah right
[14:38:21] <danzik17> misterm: Ah, missed that.
[14:38:22] <woopwoop> thank you
[14:39:25] <Kambfhase> also ui has an offset property by i have never used that.
[14:40:24] <HS^> Kambfhase its a sortable ..
[14:40:28] <HS^> thats what makes it difficult
[14:40:44] <HS^> maybe i can show what i have 1 sec
[14:40:51] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah. hmmmm :/
[14:41:47] <HS^> basicly i want to have leftside a menu,  right side a sortable.   then drop a menu item on the sortable... which then shows as a div i specify
[14:42:49] <HS^> when i say helper: myfunction  in the draggable , it will drag the div i return in myfunction .....
[14:42:56] <HS^> but when its dropped the original item is dropped
[14:44:18] <HS^> so imagine menu item is a sun image, i drag it to the right side and want to see for example a weather div
[14:44:30] <HS^> is this kind of thing really strange/uncommon?
[14:44:58] <Kambfhase> sounds like a reasonable use to me.
[14:45:08] <Kambfhase> have you been lookin for plugins?
[14:47:17] <skypce> guys , can you helpme please, 201.241.183.63/muebleria_2011
[14:47:52] <skypce> when you click out of search and click in again the placeholder color change
[14:48:00] <HS^> i dont know about plugins or where to search
[14:48:40] <Getty> someone an idea where i can get the cloned object from if i move a draggable into a sortable? I checkout the stuff i get on .receive() on the sortable, but i just the the "source" not the clone of the draggable
[14:51:39] <Kambfhase> skypce: a) i dont see a search b) upgrade your jQuery version
[14:51:49] <skyl> I need to find a textarea that has all of 3 different classes
[14:52:11] <skypce> thank you Kambfhase
[14:52:45] <Kambfhase> skyl: $('textarea.class1.class2.class3')
[14:55:18] <skyl> Kambfhase, thanks for the tip, I didn't know that
[14:56:03] <Kambfhase> css selectors. :)
[14:56:14] <xrated> xPath light.

[14:58:48] <Mr_Grim> hey
[14:59:15] <Mr_Grim> i have an an onclick event within an element. is it possible with jquery to get the id of the element which caused the onclick?
[14:59:28] <Kambfhase> yes
[15:00:14] <Kambfhase> $( parentelem).click(function( event){ console.log( event.target.id );})
[15:00:58] <Mr_Grim> will that run console.log for all onclick events?
[15:01:29] <Kambfhase> that will cun console.log for all click events triggered on parentelem or within
[15:01:47] <Mr_Grim> thats awesome
[15:01:47] <Mr_Grim> thanks
[15:01:57] <Kambfhase> np
[15:14:11] <smplstk> Kambfhase: aren't you just rebinding by doing that?
[15:14:24] <smplstk> I don't think that's what he's asking for...
[15:14:46] <Kambfhase> well, he didnt complain in the last 10 min
[15:16:32] <smplstk> Kambfhase: tru
[15:16:49] <smplstk> he also said thanks, so ya

[15:36:21] <Mr_Grim> jQElementId =  '#' + $(event.target).attr('id');
[15:36:23] <Mr_Grim> thats the line of code
[15:36:27] <Mr_Grim> event is not defined
[15:38:59] <Kambfhase> see my code i pasted above. you need to specify the paremeter event as the first parameter of the handler
[15:39:37] <danzik17> Mr_Grim: Or use 'this' (which in the handler is set to the element that threw the event)
[15:44:32] <Mr_Grim> k thanks
[15:49:44] <k6hx> i seem to be having some difficulty with a simple iphone/jqtouch/jquery app which displays a google map.
[15:50:06] <k6hx> it doesn't seem to have the right viewport (pans aren't centered, and the frame doesn't refresh entirely)
[15:50:28] <k6hx> anybody have any ideas?  google suggests others have had difficulties, but no definitive help.

[16:54:39] <j_wright> what a tragic turn of events
[16:55:51] <JesperA> =)
[16:56:16] <ggarri_> hello
[16:56:30] <ggarri_> somebody would know asking to if it is possible to use parameter in a function() when use for example click events
[16:56:43] <ggarri_> as this: $(boxes[i]).hover(function(){ }
[16:56:59] <ggarri_> I'd want to use parameter when I call this function
[16:57:05] <ggarri_> is it possible?
[16:57:19] <JesperA> test it
[16:57:32] <ggarri_> ok
[16:57:35] <ggarri_> but, how ?
[16:58:09] <ggarri_> I want to use for example the parameter 'i' inside of the function
[16:58:22] <ggarri_> how I can do that?
[16:58:36] <ggarri_> $(boxes[i]).hover(function(newvar = i){ } ????
[16:58:41] <groenroos> I heard a rumour that the .change() event is only fired for textual inputs and textareas when the element loses focus; is there an alternative way to call a function immediately as the user types a single letter into it?
[17:02:33] <JesperA> http://lolmicrosoft.ytmnd.com/
[17:05:50] <detain> Making a web-based Flot  graph settings manager ... is there any type of postential issue with me parts of documents cut and paste into the help sections of my scrript ?
[17:06:18] <detain> like i know im allowed to reuse the JS but not sure about the docs
[17:06:32] <detain> woudl that be plagurism ?
[17:06:42] <fotoflo> hmm, sometimes i don't understand the order in which my code executes. especially if there is an ajax request involved, some things execute and then some things just seem to fault. What's going on here?

[17:23:25] <courpse> If i have layed divs, How can i trigger click only on a top layer?
[17:23:51] <courpse> When they all haev 2 classes, 1 is the same, second is what i want to match which is dynamic.
[17:24:19] <misterm> courpse:what do you mean by top?
[17:24:47] <courpse> z axis on top.
[17:26:03] <jaypitidi> how can I get the .animate() method to resize a div from the center outwards and inwards towards the center?
[17:27:07] <min|dvir|us> http//min.dvir.us/ -- I have a function, which lets you scroll #contact to the top, getting called onresize and onload, but it only functions properly onload.
[17:27:11] <min|dvir|us> Any thoughts?
[17:27:44] <jaypitidi> .animate( {'width': '0',  'height': '0' } , 300 ,  'swing' ).animate( {'width': '600px' ,  'height': '500px' } , 300 , 'swing' ); will resize it from and towards the top left.
[17:43:20] <Jarred> Is there anything wrong with this function (window.questions[question_number].answers[answer_number].id evaluates to an integer)? http://pastie.org/2408995

[18:06:48] <NCS_One> hi
[18:09:30] <NCS_One> on FF when I do "$('#inputId').focus();" it gives focus but gets out almost immediately
[18:49:22] <min|dvir|us> http//min.dvir.us/ -- I have a function, which lets you scroll #contact to the top, getting called onresize and onload, but it only functions properly onload. Any suggestions?
[19:00:57] <AfroTurf> $("element").slideUp(400, function() { $(this).html("html").slideDown(400); }); this works.. but has a jumping effect. how can i this work a little more smoothly
[19:02:23] <min|dvir|us> AfroTurf: I don't think you can use $(this).
[19:03:12] <AfroTurf> yes i can :) even when i use $("element") does the same thing
[19:03:41] <devians> Hey guys, im animating some elements on screen, but when the tab isnt in focus, all animations are stopped ( its in the additional notes for animate, its to save cpu cycles ) whats the most appropriate way to deal with this? should i be detecting tab focus and pushing elements where they need to be without animation, or can i force the animation to play without tab focus?
[19:05:28] <AfroTurf> i thnk slideUp is caching the old height of what the "element" before i slideDown again
[19:19:42] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/ sizeToWindow(), which pads the bottom of the screen so #contact is higher, happens onload and onresize but only works right onload. Any thoughts?
[19:33:39] <AfroTurf> anyone here?
[19:38:21] <authorblues1> I have a $.post() call with the format $.post(url, data, success). Firebug is showing the request is being made, returned with 200 OK, and the data I want is there, but success isn't being called. Is there some other criteria I can check to determine why the success function never fires?
[19:40:00] <Superman_> what could be the possible reason if ajax content don't shown on page but after hitting refresh??
[19:40:17] <letterpress> authorblues1 can you paste that code?
[19:41:03] <authorblues1> letterpress, et al: https://gist.github.com/cc68e10c302d1357f7e2
[19:41:19] <ShaunO`work> authorblues1: i think it's possible to have things like that happening if the response data type is json or so and the json data itself is invalid
[19:41:28] <authorblues1> ...oh
[19:41:29] <ShaunO`work> jquery fails to parse it and potentially doesn't call the success delegate
[19:41:44] <ShaunO`work> run the response data through jsonlint.com or something and check that it's valid
[19:41:45] <authorblues1> ShaunO`work: that is exactly the problem
[19:41:50] <authorblues1> thank you so much
[19:44:45] <ShaunO`work> sweet, i've run into the same thing before, consider implementing an error delegate, it may be called in this situation (though not 100% sure, and it may not even be descriptive) but it may be nice to know it was called
[19:46:57] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/ uses sizeToWindow(), which pads the bottom of the document so #content goes higher. It is called onload and onresize; however, it only functions correctly onload. Any thoughts?
[19:47:16] <min|dvir|us> I mean #contact.
[20:00:10] <dcope> If I have a href that triggers a function, is it possible to have the browser not "navigate" to it?
[20:00:25] <dcope> right now, if someome clicks it, it takes them to #. so if they click the back button they have to click it twice.
[20:04:24] <letterpress> dcope: have you tried http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[20:04:50] <min|dvir|us> Anyone have any thoughts?
[20:05:20] <dcope> letterpress: wow, worked great
[20:05:27] <dcope> jQuery is awesome :) many thanks
[20:06:03] <min|dvir|us> The script is here: http://min.dvir.us/site_media/static/style/blue/scroll.js
[20:12:16] <__import__> Is it possible to use jquery to read RSS feeds from external sites?
[20:12:30] <__import__> If so, what would be a good customizable example?
[20:13:13] <paul_irish> hi guyzz. i'm looking to hire someone for a quick 1hr freelance thing. you need to be pretty good at shell scripting and have adium installed. (i want to export all adium logs to HTML nicely). pm me.
[20:14:06] <__import__> paul_irish, I really doubt this channel is for advertising
[20:15:12] <paul_irish> it's not.
[20:15:36] <paul_irish> but i'm abusing that rule temporarily.
[20:16:00] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/ uses sizeToWindow(), which pads the bottom of the document so #content goes higher. It is called onload and onresize; however, it only functions correctly onload. Any thoughts?
[20:16:07] <min|dvir|us> The script is here: http://min.dvir.us/site_media/static/style/blue/scroll.js
[20:17:51] <letterpress> the script is running. it's applying 30px padding to the body's bottom. so...
[20:18:20] <min|dvir|us> It is supposed to add more, if you have a normal-sized screen.
[20:18:34] <min|dvir|us> letterpress, it's supposed to get #contact directly under #header.
[20:19:47] <Rinthe> how can i check if something is in the URL?
[20:20:40] <ShaunO`work> window.location will give you information about the current url
[20:21:37] <ShaunO`work> https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.location has a list of properties you can use
[20:21:44] <letterpress> also check out http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[20:22:00] <letterpress> but that could be overkill if you're just looking for something
[20:25:58] <tbranyen> letterpress: he broke out his deparam stuff into another plugin as well
[20:26:12] <letterpress> good point
[20:26:29] <Rinthe> thank you!
[20:27:29] <min|dvir|us> Anyone have any thoughts?
[20:27:31] <letterpress> but bbq is only 4kb
[20:30:32] <letterpress> well min|dvir|us my screen is pretty normal but it's always padding 30px on the bottom of the body. even then i'm not sure how that's going to move anything except the end of the document.
[20:31:01] <min|dvir|us> letterpress, your browser full-screen, and refresh.
[20:31:19] <min|dvir|us> The point is that the bottom of the document should have exactly enough padding to make #contact hit #header.
[20:32:00] <min|dvir|us> Like the other h2s do.
[20:40:05] <e6nian> I'm hack some tooltips code, that I wanna the tooltips both show when the mouseover the elements and the tooltips div, what should I do?
[20:40:41] <e6nian> currently,I use tipsy from http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/
[20:41:59] <e6nian> and find jquerytools support that option, http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html
[20:42:15] <e6nian> I wanna port this option into tipsy.
[20:42:45] <e6nian> but can't understand jquerytools tooltip's solution.
[20:43:04] <e6nian> any idea about this?
[20:55:47] <doom> is there an easy way to only allow numbers and '.' in input text fields (as well as backspace, delete etc)?
[21:11:53] <dcope> any idea as to why this would take like 3 clicks to get it to work?

[21:12:02] <dcope> and when it does work, it immediately toggles back? :(

[23:04:29] <Aquaguy> is there any way to apply a fadeIn to a object after another object has been faded out? example: objectA.fadeOut().objectB.fadeIn()
[23:05:19] <Ned_> Aquaguy: err, yes
[23:05:30] <Ned_> a.fadeOut(function () { b.fadeIn() })
[23:05:40] <Aquaguy> oh, ok, thank you!
[23:05:40] <Ned_> Aquaguy: you use the callback of the first one to trigger the second
[23:05:48] <Aquaguy> great

[23:07:24] <Fredcpp> but I'd like to load the caption for the link from that file too
[23:07:54] <Fredcpp> the ajaxloadlink function loosks like this: function AjaxLoadLink(e) {
[23:07:54] <Fredcpp>     e.preventDefault();
[23:07:54] <Fredcpp> 	$('#maincol').hide();
[23:07:54] <Fredcpp> 	$('#maincol').html( $('#loading_msg').html());
[23:07:54] <Fredcpp> 	$('#maincol').fadeIn('slow');
[23:07:55] <Fredcpp> 	$('#maincol').load(this.href . '#content');
[23:07:55] <Fredcpp> }
[23:08:36] <Fredcpp> aby clue about how to make every hyperlink to load the text from the H1 contained in the file It has as href?

[23:10:13] <Fredcpp> some

[23:19:52] <cam_> hello
[23:23:14] <cam_> hi
[23:24:15] <Fredcpp> hey
[23:24:20] <dr0id> hey
[23:24:50] <cam_> i have a problem
[23:24:57] <dr0id> who doesn't
[23:27:23] <juha_> i have a mental problem, is #jQuery the correct place to ask for psychiatric help?
[23:27:42] <dr0id> yes
[23:28:26] <juha_> i feel rejected because coldhead refuses to give me aids, it's causing me some serious mental issues
[23:28:35] <cam_> what is a sibling element?
[23:28:58] <dr0id> cam_: HTML 101
[23:29:09] <cam_> ?
[23:29:17] <juha_> cam_: quick example: <table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table> td would be the sibling of td
[23:29:20] <cam_> i am reading the next() method
[23:29:37] <dr0id> haha, good one
[23:29:59] <dr0id> ok, another quick example: <ul><li></li><li></li></ul> li would be the subling of li
[23:30:08] <dr0id> sibling*
[23:30:55] <cam_> because there are 2 or more li/td elements?
[23:31:00] <dr0id> :D
[23:31:02] <dr0id> (rofl)
[23:31:44] <Ned_> cam_: because they share the same parent
[23:32:16] <Ned_> in the example above, both <li> tags share the same <ul> parent, therefore the <li> tags are siblings
[23:32:29] <cam_> can a IMG and a P be sibling if they both are in the same DIV ?
[23:32:34] <Ned_> cam_: yes
[23:32:41] <dr0id> <parent><child1></child1>-siblings-<child2></child2></parent>
[23:32:42] <cam_> ohhh perfect :D
[23:32:43] <Ned_> <div><p>hello</p><img src=""></div>
[23:33:04] <dr0id> .next() and .prev() to select next and prev siblings
[23:33:28] <cam_> now i understand why my jquery code doesn't work
[23:33:29] <cam_> :P
[23:34:27] <dr0id> I'm glad
[23:35:26] <cam_> i have a question
[23:35:46] <mercury_> hello. why does jquery ajax post request does more request than one ? i have some button onclick and function $.ajax behidn this function and the first onclick its OK but every other click adds the requests. any idea ?
[23:40:17] <mercury_> like it would append functions
[23:44:20] <Fredcpp> I want to load the tittle of a set of hyperlinks from the page they are linking; but this doesn't seem to work: $("a.ajaxified").load( this.attr(href) + '#h1_tittle');
[23:44:32] <mercury_> the strange think is that simple XMLHttpRequest works fine but jquery.ajax doesnt.
[23:57:20] <mneimne> hello is there a jquery image carousel with pagining i have been searching for 2 days and no result
[23:58:07] <Fredcpp> well officially
[23:58:09] <Fredcpp> $(document).ready(function()
[23:58:09] <Fredcpp> {
[23:58:09] <Fredcpp> 	$("a.ajaxified").load( this.attr(href) . ' #h1_title');
[23:58:09] <Fredcpp> });
[23:58:12] <Fredcpp> doesn't work :(
[23:58:45] <Fredcpp> does someone have a idea how can I make It work? :S
