[00:02:38] <mydoghasworms> coldhead: Cool, thanks. Is there a bot on this channel to pass on messages?
[00:02:58] <mydoghasworms> OK, yes, phone number is better.
[00:03:18] <mydoghasworms> mattyh88: Try taking away the * from the name attribute?
[00:03:20] <coldhead> bot-t: tell mydoghasworms this is how you can leave a message
[00:03:21] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[00:03:35] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[00:03:35] <bot-t> ;)
[00:03:38] <coldhead> bot-t: i love you
[00:03:39] <bot-t> no you don't
[00:03:44] <mydoghasworms> Is nice, thanks.
[00:03:44] <bot-t> (24 secs ago) <coldhead> tell mydoghasworms this is how you can leave a message
[00:03:54] <coldhead> don't tell me how i feel, bot-t
[00:03:55] <bot-t> coldhead, Is that a question?
[00:03:58] <coldhead> my love is real
[00:04:49] <mattyh88> mydoghasworms: should be a valid selector, but i'll try: p
[00:06:59] <devilsdue> so
[00:07:56] <coldhead> one word
[00:07:58] <coldhead> was all it took
[00:09:20] <mydoghasworms> coldhead: That was very sinister.
[00:11:36] <sasori> how to check "if" no radio button was ticked ?
[00:11:51] <coldhead> he is subnormal, mydoghasworms
[00:11:57] <timing> sasori: it's not posted
[00:12:04] <coldhead> in a spam the channel with thousands of lines of crap way
[00:12:24] <sasori> hmmn
[00:14:37] <sasori> got..nevermind XD
[00:14:47] <coldhead> great work sasori
[00:24:24] <aaa> ok
[00:37:16] <juha_> hello peeps
[00:44:44] <Nedlinpopo> hello all
[00:44:55] <Nedlinpopo> I'm having trouble with .remove
[00:45:32] <Nedlinpopo> i've got a div that I want to remove a child div from, but i want to keep a copy of the child div around
[00:46:28] <Nedlinpopo> i thought that was just var copy= parent.find("div").remove();
[00:46:36] <Nedlinpopo> but that doesn't appear to do what i want
[00:46:42] <Nedlinpopo> anybody kno whow to do it?
[00:46:55] <xec> Nedlinpopo: what do you mean by "keep a copy"? have you looked at .clone() ?
[00:47:21] <Nedlinpopo> i suppose i could clone the child then remove it from the parent
[00:47:47] <Nedlinpopo> is that the right way?  I kinda got the impression from the documentation that .remove shoudl return the removed elements
[00:48:40] <Nedlinpopo> also, maybe i'm doing this the dumb way.  is there a good way to do templating in jquery?
[00:49:25] <Nedlinpopo> (currently i'm iterating through a bare HTML page and filling out copies of it's parts with the result of an ajax query)
[00:50:57] <alkemann> anyone experienced with history.js?
[00:52:48] <jkline> Nedlinpopo: http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[00:54:30] <Nedlinpopo> jkline: thanks this might be sophisticated enough for what i need
[00:57:14] <jkline> Nedlinpopo: there is all sorts of Template stuff http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[00:57:43] <Nedlinpopo> the cursory google search i did earlier seems to have missed it
[00:58:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[00:58:15] <Nedlinpopo> oh yeah, also this is apparently deprecated?
[00:58:19] <aaronmcadam> underscore templates, mustache, handlebars
[00:58:22] <jkline> Nedlinpopo: it's not like "template" is a common word or anything :)
[00:58:51] <Nedlinpopo> no i did find this one, but i dismissed it since it claims to be deprecated, I couldn't find what eh replacement was though
[00:58:54] <aaronmcadam> has jq-tmpl been discontinued?
[00:59:35] <Nedlinpopo> aaronmcadam: accrding to the big bold header at teh top it has
[00:59:45] <aaronmcadam> I can't see that
[00:59:48] <jkline> that is news to me
[00:59:52] <aaronmcadam> "This feature and its documentation are in beta and subject to change before final release."
[00:59:59] <Nedlinpopo> ?
[01:00:06] <jkline> i have not been following the jQuery news
[01:00:07] <aaronmcadam> ah i see
[01:00:12] <Nedlinpopo> mine says "Note: This plugin was released as BETA and is now deprecated, no  longer in active development or maintenance. The docs remain here for  the time being (for reference) until a suitable replacement template  plugin is ready."
[01:00:29] <aaronmcadam> why is it deprecated
[01:00:37] <Nedlinpopo> you're looking at http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/ correct?
[01:00:42] <aaronmcadam> maybe cuz there's better options
[01:01:02] <aaronmcadam> maybe it's cuz other projects solve the problem already
[01:01:12] <aaronmcadam> better than a beta project could
[01:01:57] <Nedlinpopo> aaronmcadam: does it seriously not have the big deprecation warning for you?
[01:02:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah it does on the main page
[01:02:14] <Nedlinpopo> oh okay
[01:02:15] <jkline> I think $.tmpl was the microsoft contribution to templating, it was meant to be THE answer. However, that was many moons ago, and clearly something changed but I don't know what.
[01:02:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah
[01:02:29] * Nedlinpopo feels more sane now
[01:02:37] <aaronmcadam> I dunno if data-linking is still alive
[01:02:42] <Nedlinpopo> *whew* I thought i was loosing it for a second there
[01:03:26] <jkline> apparently this has something to say about templates, http://blog.jquery.com/2011/04/16/official-plugins-a-change-in-the-roadmap/
[01:04:00] <aaronmcadam> well that just said that it was no longer an official plugin
[01:05:40] <aaronmcadam> ahhh yea
[01:05:47] <aaronmcadam> the jq ui templating plugin
[01:06:16] <aaronmcadam> http://www.handlebarsjs.com/
[01:06:20] <aaronmcadam> https://github.com/janl/mustache.js
[01:06:24] <Nedlinpopo> apparently i've come to it in the middle of a transition and nothing really exists at the moment
[01:07:08] <aaronmcadam> will have to ask a ui team member what the plan is
[01:07:14] <aaronmcadam> in the meantime, just use another
[01:07:17] <jkline> Nedlinpopo: The thing you are working on now, how long do you expect it to last?
[01:07:24] <coldhead> tmpl sucks dogs balls
[01:07:25] <aaronmcadam> underscore templates are awsome
[01:07:35] <coldhead> you can break it by having an '@' in your template
[01:07:38] <aaronmcadam> or try mustache or handlebars
[01:07:40] <coldhead> it's the suckiest thing in the world
[01:07:48] <Nedlinpopo> jkline: depends, maybe 1 month, maybe 3 years
[01:08:14] <jkline> seems like maybe _ is the way to go
[01:08:23] <aaronmcadam> _ is awesome
[01:08:26] <jkline> apparently coldhead doesn't like tmpl
[01:08:33] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[01:09:01] <Nedlinpopo> probbaly the 1month timeframe is more accurate, in 3 years it'll probably have been re-written 2x over and only exist as a debug tool
[01:09:01] <aaronmcadam> coldhead is learning, i'm his senpai ;)
[01:09:03] <jkline> originally I was going to say just use tmpl and change it out when the time comes, using beta code for three years is no big deal. But then coldhead had to come along and ruin everything :)
[01:09:38] <jkline> so for a project that will last between 1 month and a year pick whatever
[01:09:39] <aaronmcadam> you don't wanna  be deploying beta software when the project is dead
[01:10:01] <aaronmcadam> that's just silly
[01:11:02] <Nedlinpopo> mostly I want the one that is well behaved and makes this code elegant and maintainable so that when we do scrap it and start over, i'll have something to go on
[01:11:32] <aaronmcadam> Nedlinpopo: pick a project that is actie
[01:11:34] <aaronmcadam> active*
[01:11:48] <Nedlinpopo> yeah, that's why i was scared by jq-tmpl
[01:11:50] <aaronmcadam> like mustache or handlebars or underscore templates
[01:12:00] <Nedlinpopo> i'm looking at handlebars right now
[01:12:23] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's meant to be quite good
[01:12:27] <aaronmcadam> yehuda is awesome anyway
[01:13:45] <coldhead> if you're doing anything with twitter and rely on the @symbol, don't use tmpl
[01:14:01] <coldhead> and if you're not doing something with twitter, what are you: a cave man?
[01:14:24] <aaronmcadam> I'm not coldhead
[01:14:54] <Hooloovoo> coldhead: i like how you think
[01:15:12] <cypha> I have a json array, and I'm not sure how to make the data within accessible--> [{'username': u'xyz', 'first_name': u'x', 'last_name': u'z', 'middle_name': u'y'}] As the $.post callback, I have .success(function(data) { $("#mytemplate").tmpl(data).appendTo("#target"); })
[01:16:00] <cypha> when I didn't have [ ] around the data, I could just do "username" and I'd get the value
[01:16:12] <cypha> so now how do I access the data?
[01:16:23] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: what you have is a single element array
[01:16:44] <Nedlinpopo> so do var myobj = thing[0];
[01:16:51] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, I plan on having multiple elements in there afterwards
[01:16:58] <Nedlinpopo> then you can say myobj["data"]
[01:17:25] <Hooloovoo> cypha: then do $.each(array, function(a, b) { //b here is the object. })
[01:18:38] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, by elements you mean { }?
[01:18:55] <tachyean> hello
[01:19:21] <tachyean> any ideea on ... how can i check if an element is delagated or not ? :)
[01:19:22] <cypha> cuz I'll eventually have [{stuff:yes},{morestuff:yeah}}
[01:19:25] <cypha> cuz I'll eventually have [{stuff:yes},{morestuff:yeah}]
[01:19:43] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: you have an array of objects, so you have to get an object from that array before you can check an attribute of the object
[01:20:08] <cypha> so data[0] will be the first dictionary in there
[01:20:18] <cypha> (i currently only have one)
[01:20:41] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: usually when you're using an array it's full of the smae thing.  if you want a contianer for different things, that's what an object is for (like {} instead of [])
[01:21:12] <cypha> k
[01:21:29] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: {} is not a dictionary, it's an object.  JS objects are a lot like dictionaries, but they are *not* python dictionaries
[01:21:43] <Nedlinpopo> (or whatever other languages you know)
[01:21:51] <cypha> k
[01:21:57] <cypha> yes, that's what I was comparing it to
[01:22:13] <cypha> is a js object like a python object?
[01:22:21] <Hooloovoo> no
[01:22:28] <Hooloovoo> a js object is a weird thing =P
[01:22:34] <cypha> so there's nothing in python like a js object?
[01:22:52] <Hooloovoo> i doubt it. it's kinda like a dictionary
[01:22:57] <cypha> k
[01:22:57] <Hooloovoo> but not really
[01:23:03] <cypha> why, not really?
[01:23:30] <Hooloovoo> i'm not the best pythoneer out there so i'm not sure exactly what parts differs
[01:23:32] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: one way to think about objects is that they are collections of named properties, in that way both python and JS are similar
[01:24:27] <cypha> is it possible to arrange the js object array in a way that I can access the key/values as user.username and user.dob?
[01:24:28] <Nedlinpopo> but that only lets you inspect them, the way JS and python handle inheritance or typing are very different
[01:24:37] <cypha> ah ok
[01:24:42] <dismist-> im looking for an expert javascript coder who is familiar with air to help with a big money application that is for the most part already written, just needs code optimization and needs to be able to handle multiple functions running at the same time
[01:25:17] <cypha> without doing var user = whatever in the js script
[01:25:21] <Hooloovoo> dismist-: adobe air? D:
[01:25:33] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: not entirely sure, but i think obj.attr is the same as obj["attr"] in JS
[01:25:35] <cypha> i mean by strictly arranging the json array
[01:25:46] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, yes, I read that it was
[01:26:05] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, but my question is, how can I arrange the array as such?
[01:26:30] <cypha> for example, this is what I currently have https://gist.github.com/35c9a2a8cce5f728a274
[01:26:32] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: are you sure what you want is an array?
[01:26:40] <cypha> but of course, data.username isn't valid
[01:27:49] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: i can't read this, is it php or something?
[01:27:53] <Hooloovoo> is everyone using templating these days? D:
[01:28:28] <Nedlinpopo> Hooloovoo: yeah man, get with the times :P
[01:28:44] <Hooloovoo> lol! i'll have a look at it later. =D
[01:28:59] <Hooloovoo> what's the best templating plugin right now?
[01:29:44] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, I basically want to return 'user', with a buncha attributes like username, dob, marital_status....and be able to use it as such (user.username, user.marital_status). But in the same array, I'd like to be able to return "pictures" with pictures.location, pictures.date, etc
[01:30:04] <cypha> and I would preferrably like to set my array up in such a way that it can inherently do that
[01:30:10] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: i think you shoudln't make it an array, just use an object instead
[01:30:15] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, php? it's all js
[01:30:39] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, ok, so if I make it an object, how would I do that?
[01:30:40] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: what's with the {%raw%} jibber-jabber?
[01:30:43] <Hooloovoo> cypha: you're gonna return the info for many users in one call?
[01:31:08] <Hooloovoo> Nedlinpopo: i think that's django templating or something
[01:31:14] <cypha> jinja2
[01:31:25] * Nedlinpopo is not a web programmer by trade
[01:31:31] <cypha> it just lets me use jquery.template's ${} and whatnot
[01:31:44] <Nedlinpopo> well, i don't really know how that works
[01:31:53] <cypha> Hooloovoo, not necessarily returning many users in one call
[01:31:54] <cypha> but I may
[01:32:06] <cypha> I just want to set my array and code up in a way to standardize it
[01:32:13] <cypha> that way i can always send my json in a particular forrmat
[01:32:20] <cypha> and I can always extract the data in a particular format
[01:32:48] <Nedlinpopo> cypha, look for a way to do a for loop
[01:32:57] <Nedlinpopo> and iterate through the array
[01:33:11] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, will that allow me to do user.username?
[01:33:16] <Nedlinpopo> (even if it's a lenght 1 array)
[01:33:47] <cypha> cuz doesn't my array have to have [{'user':{'username':'john'}}]
[01:34:27] <Nedlinpopo> something like for (i in data) { user = data[i]; print user.username; }
[01:34:53] <Nedlinpopo> dealing with the scope issues et cetera
[01:35:43] <ravenzz> It is "Once a year I also write at my blog" correct?
[01:35:46] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, but see, then I've hardcoded that "user" in there
[01:36:08] <cypha> "Once a year I also write on my blog"
[01:36:14] <ravenzz> also does once a year can be used to say "rarely"
[01:36:23] <cypha> yes
[01:36:25] <nVee> hey guys, how can I ittirate through an array with jquery? I tried $(arrayName).each() but it did not work
[01:36:33] <ravenzz> or it is just my italian to english translation?
[01:36:38] <ravenzz> oh k
[01:36:44] <ravenzz> but I am in the wrong channel
[01:36:45] <ravenzz> lol
[01:36:46] <Nedlinpopo> yeah, but user is just  a local variable refering to an element (in this case an object) in the array
[01:36:57] <ravenzz> I was sure that it is #english
[01:36:58] <ravenzz> sorry
[01:36:58] <nVee> forget I said anything :)
[01:37:11] <Hooloovoo> nVee: $.each(array, function(i, val) {})
[01:37:14] <Nedlinpopo> nVee, drop the $()
[01:37:19] <cypha> Nedlinpopo, is it not possible to make the 'user' portion handle in the array's format?
[01:37:53] <cypha> something like [{'user':{'username':'john', 'yob':'1984'}}]
[01:38:12] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: again, you're confusing objects and arrays.
[01:38:36] <cypha> so if I iterate through that array, can I then just do user.username?
[01:39:10] <Hooloovoo> yes
[01:39:51] <cypha> Hooloovoo, for (i in data) ...
[01:39:55] <cypha> ?
[01:40:37] <Hooloovoo> cypha: or $.each(arr, function(i,val) {})
[01:40:56] <Hooloovoo> cypha: oh and it's for (var i in data) {}
[01:41:01] <cypha> and that will automatically make user.username available within jquery-templ?
[01:41:18] <Hooloovoo> i don't know anything about templates, so idk
[01:41:23] <cypha> oh ok
[01:42:25] <cypha> Hooloovoo, what's arr?
[01:42:33] <Hooloovoo> an array
[01:45:44] <cypha> Hooloovoo, http://paste.ofcode.org/uZdbpvHysfQvuxw6hcDaaJ
[01:46:03] <cypha> will this be how it'll work?
[01:46:14] <cypha> (notice lines 4,20,21)
[01:46:29] <cypha> oops, line 2 should be user.username
[01:47:00] <Hooloovoo> cypha: i still don't know how templates work so i don't know
[01:47:33] <nospinzy> someone want to do a job for me
[01:47:40] <nospinzy> ill paypal them
[01:47:49] <Nedlinpopo> cypha: also on line 17 i think you mean $.each(data, function ...
[01:47:55] <cypha> yes
[01:47:56] <cypha> i changed that
[02:00:08] <cypha> Hooloovoo, that didn't work
[02:00:12] <cypha> $.each(data, function(i,val) {})
[02:00:48] <cypha> https://gist.github.com/5482cf6865e8933a7e96
[02:01:19] <cypha> with line 3 added, it doesn't put "Working" in #status or any of the stuff below it
[02:01:52] <cypha> oops, even with the semicolon
[02:12:42] <Nedlinpopo> okay, thanks for the help everybody
[02:12:47] <Nedlinpopo> it's bedtime for me!
[02:20:37] <coops> any one free for a little freelance work to fix a jquery bug that I just can't work out ?

[02:49:38] <Weedjo> Sorry to post it again: Hey, I've got this problem and no one seems to know an answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7742620/how-to-know-when-the-dom-of-an-iframe-is-ready-again-after-changing-its-content/7742680#7742680  Any ideas? Thank you! :)
[02:50:21] <ravenzz> load ?
[02:55:23] <ravenzz> Weedjo http://jsfiddle.net/sU6kF/
[02:55:27] <Weedjo> @ravenzz : when I use load, it's never finished :(
[02:56:50] <Weedjo> http://jsfiddle.net/sU6kF/1/ this is the code I was using, but it's not working! The alert never appears
[02:57:34] <ravenzz> there is no html there
[02:57:35] <ravenzz> :o?
[02:57:44] <Weedjo> It's a firefox extension
[02:57:54] <ravenzz> also you can't access the iframe content
[02:58:07] <Weedjo> that's working without problems
[02:58:14] <ravenzz> if its src is not hosted in the same domain
[02:58:21] <Weedjo> when I put an alert in front of it, everthing is working perfectly
[02:58:34] <Weedjo> it's not violating the same orign policy ;)
[03:00:24] <ravenzz> anyway i shown you that it works, so the issue should be related to something else
[03:02:05] <Weedjo> as I wrote in the stackoverflow-forum: The page is a page from facebook and it contents a lot of ajax and the .load() isn't working because it thinks the page is never finished loading

[04:38:45] <quicksilver> Hopsy: it was the 'if' part he wanted to fix, I imagine
[04:38:59] <quicksilver> hence my answer. Javascritp question not jquery, o fcourse.
[04:39:47] <Hopsy> owh I see haha
[04:42:45] <Weedjo> Hey, I've got this problem and no one seems to know an answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7742620/how-to-know-when-the-dom-of-an-iframe-is-ready-again-after-changing-its-content/7742680#7742680  Any ideas? Thank you! :)
[04:47:43] <seutje> ?g jquery frameready @ Weedjo
[04:47:44] <bot-t> Weedjo, jquery.frameready.js - chamilo - Next generation content ... - http://code.google.com/p/chamilo/source/browse/main/inc/lib/javascript/jquery.frameready.js?repo=classic&r=39a2ef8dd8332b3680a10b24c922d8676c991aeb
[04:54:14] <Weedjo> @bot-t and  @seutje : I'll check on frameready, thanks :)
[04:54:38] <seutje> Weedjo: that link is wrong btw, it's frameready as part of a content editing thingymajig
[04:54:47] <seutje> looks like the original source is removed :/
[04:55:21] <seutje> link to the demo and link to the source are both dead on http://daemach.wordpress.com/frameready/
[04:55:58] <Weedjo> @seutje, but I can use this one, can't I? http://code.google.com/p/chamilo/source/browse/main/inc/lib/javascript/jquery.frameready.js?repo=classic&r=39a2ef8dd8332b3680a10b24c922d8676c991aeb
[04:56:45] <Weedjo> shall I just add it somewhere in the jquery code and use $frameready ?
[04:57:03] <seutje> ?tias
[04:57:04] <bot-t> Try It And See
[04:57:45] <Weedjo> all right :P
[04:57:59] <Weedjo> does it matter where I put it into jquery? never touched the file^^
[04:58:29] <seutje> what?
[04:59:04] <seutje> preferably after jquery itself I suppose... o.O
[04:59:19] <Weedjo> hmm ok
[05:03:48] <ArchAdmin> hi
[05:03:55] <ArchAdmin> where can i download skype source code?
[05:06:45] <NodeX> #skype
[05:07:20] <ArchAdmin> NodeX: very funny.
[05:08:25] <NodeX> then why are you asking in a jquery help chanell ?
[05:09:08] <ArchAdmin> NodeX: because there is no skype channel on freenode.
[05:09:34] <ArchAdmin> and people of this channel are generally clever and helpful
[05:09:49] <NodeX> dude skype is closed source
[05:10:02] <NodeX> and Microsoft now own it iirc so that will never change
[05:10:28] <ArchAdmin> what? microsoft????
[05:10:31] <ArchAdmin> OMFG
[05:10:38] * ArchAdmin uninstalling skype
[05:14:14] <m4xx> lol
[05:14:26] <m4xx> you've just heard this for the first time now arch?
[05:14:34] <johanhar> Hi. Is there any timer in javascript or jquery? I am going to make a ajax-request every 10 second
[05:14:43] <NodeX> setTimer
[05:15:04] <NodeX> setTimer(function(){alert('Hi its been 10 seconds since last time')},10000);
[05:15:05] <ArchAdmin> m4xx: yes
[05:15:10] <johanhar> thanks
[05:15:36] <seutje> johanhar: but what if the ajax request takes over 10 seconds?
[05:15:41] <InDigital> hi
[05:15:42] <InDigital> :)
[05:15:55] <cypha> does this seem like a good way to show the flashmsg? https://gist.github.com/046d18f5ff4c262bd4a9
[05:16:05] <InDigital> who can help with JQuery Change event ?
[05:16:10] <johanhar> seutje: its actually just a ping ... there is no request ... hmm .. all its doing is saying: "im here"
[05:16:10] <InDigital> one question
[05:16:24] <GuidoBouman> arch
[05:16:24] <stodge> I'm experimenting with jquery mobile's nested lists. I copied the example list from the website but I don't understand why the second list doesn't have the same formatting as the initial list that's shown.
[05:16:43] <cypha> or is there a more efficient way
[05:16:54] <seutje> johanhar: I'm just saying, you should probably approach it with this in mind
[05:17:10] <triptec> if I use $(el).autocomplete("search":function(event,ui){}) how do I get the value of the input. I've used console.log(ui) and looked att the object but the input value is nowhere to be found
[05:17:32] <NodeX> triptec : event.target ?
[05:17:35] <seutje> johanhar: e.g. don't just use a timer, use a callback, so the 10 secs are initiated when the request is done, not when it's started
[05:17:37] <InDigital> is there any coder i can ask for a little help in private?
[05:18:57] <seutje> InDigital: why u gotta randomly PM me? did I show any interest in your offer?
[05:19:24] <johanhar> seutje: thanks. will do
[05:20:05] <InDigital> seutje are you coder or not?
[05:20:19] <Hooloovoo> InDigital: just ask your question in here
[05:20:25] <InDigital> ok
[05:20:55] <InDigital> so i have problem with change event and JQuery UI animation options..
[05:20:56] <GuidoBouman> ArchAdmin, check http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/05/10/its-confirmed-microsoft-announces-acquisition-of-skype-for-8-5-billion/
[05:21:23] <InDigital> problem happens only on firefox
[05:21:36] <InDigital> if i type code like this: $('#FileUploader').change(function() { $('#attchmnt_container').show('slide',{direction:'down'},1000); });
[05:21:56] <InDigital> but if i write code like this: $('#FileUploader').change(function() { $('#attchmnt_container').show(); });
[05:22:04] <Hooloovoo> InDigital: http://jsfiddle.new recreate your problem there and paste link here.
[05:22:08] <InDigital> then everything will be ok
[05:22:39] <GuidoBouman> InDigital, there's also a slideDown(duration); method
[05:23:13] <InDigital> GuidoBouman ok i'l check now :)
[05:26:06] <InDigital> GuidoBouman listen man, you are a god! :)))
[05:26:54] <InDigital> that realy halped :)
[05:27:23] <GuidoBouman> InDigital, No problem.
[05:30:57] <stodge> Is jquery mobile stable enough for commercial use? Seeing weird things with nested lists
[05:46:02] <ArchAdmin> stodge: no, pure javascript is much more stable
[05:46:05] <ArchAdmin> except IE's
[05:50:45] <m4xx> ajpiano: dude thank you for the widget factory suggestion!!! this has made my life SO much easier.
[06:00:32] <Driekus> Guys, which jQuery history plugin should I use when using jQuery.load() to get part of a html page in AJAX and without a second request to the complete page?
[06:01:24] <Trisox> ?bbq
[06:01:25] <bot-t> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[06:02:19] <Trisox> ?botsnack
[06:02:20] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[06:02:56] <InDigital> ?botsnack
[06:02:57] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[06:03:00] <InDigital> lol
[06:03:47] <Driekus> Trisox, will have a look at that, thank you :)
[06:04:26] <ck> good mornin'
[06:04:36] <Hooloovoo> mornin
[06:05:05] <InDigital> how do you think all, it is a good idea to use JQuery for a multichannel WebChat client?
[06:06:52] <GuidoBouman> InDigital, perfect actually. Check out websockets, and which browsers support that.
[06:07:11] <InDigital> :)
[06:07:11] <GuidoBouman> InDigital, and actually: a lot of scripts doing that have been written already.
[06:08:22] <Zxurian> is there a way to tell whether an image is being loaded from cache, or pull over the web?
[06:09:28] <randomize> Zxurian: you can force it from the web
[06:09:34] <InDigital> :)
[06:09:36] <randomize> that way you can know
[06:09:49] <ck> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2446740/post-loading-check-if-an-image-is-in-the-browser-cache
[06:09:49] <randomize> send no chache headers
[06:10:33] <Zxurian> ran: I don't want to force reloading it though, I just want to check and see if it's already been cached by the client or not
[06:11:18] <Zxurian> ck: That uses constant timeouts to continuously check to see how fast it's ready, i was hoping there was an actual test method, not just continuously testing to see if it's ready and then act based on the speed of how long that test took
[06:11:57] <randomize> you can also force it to cache
[06:12:06] <randomize> but not if the browser is set not to
[06:12:12] <ck> Yeah, didn't seem very efficient to me either...
[06:13:08] <Zxurian> ... I don't want to force anything. if a client goes to site for first time, then it will of course have to download the image to cache, if the client goes back to the site, then the image will be loaded from cache instead of pulled over net, I just want to check and see which is happening
[06:15:40] <NodeX> Zxurian : the image has an onload attruibute
[06:15:46] <NodeX> method *
[06:16:52] <Zxurian> yea, that will fire based on when it's ready, not whether it's loading from cache or not.
[06:17:28] <Zxurian> although based on searches with a few extra keywords this time, it looks like it may not be possible, since browers don't let web pages look through their cache
[06:19:08] <NodeX> if you load it with ajax then the 304 resp header means it's cached
[06:19:19] <NodeX> becuase it's not been changed which means it wil be loaded from cache
[06:19:35] <ragas> how should i go about shifting the starting point of a UL of children? : get the # of children, and loop through removing the last child and inserting before first child.  ?
[06:19:39] <NodeX> but it's alot of resources on your serverside
[06:20:16] <NodeX> apparently the .complete attrribute tells you whether it's loaded too
[06:20:56] <Zxurian> NodeX: well the image is part of the page either way, so loading it via AJAX vs. inline is just one more browser request (that I can live with, as it's a background image), but regarding the ajax request, if it's a 304 as you said, then that means the client will load the image from the browser cache, and if it's anything other than 304, it'll pull it from the server
[06:21:56] <Zxurian> NodeX: that may work. (reason: i'm expirementing with large size background images, and if the user hasn't bee nto the site before, then I want to wait until after the image loads before fading it in in the background, vs if they have been to it before, just have it display as part of the page since it's loading from cache)
[06:26:25] <michael_mbp> hi anyone here
[06:32:43] <johanhar> I want to make a if-clause on a element wether it's hidden or shown ... any suggestions?
[06:34:28] <johanhar> .is() worked
[06:37:56] <Zxurian> NodeX: thank you for the suggestion, but I may be missing something. Looking through the response headers from the ajax call, I can't see anywhere where it has the actual status code. I assume I'm missing something.
[06:41:50] <NodeX> there is a responseheader somewhere
[06:42:12] <Zxurian> yea, I think I just found it, it's a property of the xhr request, not part of the headers
[06:42:28] <NodeX> The function gets passed two arguments: The jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHTTPRequest) object and a string categorizing the status of the request ("success", "notmodified", "error", "timeout", "abort", or "parsererror").
[06:42:37] <NodeX> do "notmodified"
[06:42:38] <bapi_> Hey, has anyone used any good jquery loading dialog? One of my sites takes 4-8 seconds to load, so it would be nice to have some kind of alert telling them to be patient
[06:42:54] <NodeX> or speed ythe site up :P
[06:43:11] <orolo> bapi_ padolseys loaders are cool: http://padolsey.net/p/Sonic/repo/demo/demo.html
[06:43:23] <Zxurian> i'm using jQuery 1.6.2, so i think it's a little different
[06:43:35] <Zxurian> lol, the site is already optimized, I'm just toying with large background images
[06:43:41] <randomize> you should make a custom one
[06:43:43] <randomize> flame
[06:43:44] <NodeX> I wasn't talking to you
[06:43:48] <Zxurian> lol
[06:43:50] <randomize> yeah well
[06:43:53] <randomize> I wasn't talkin to you either
[06:43:55] <randomize> what a dick.
[06:44:01] <NodeX> ?
[06:44:08] <NodeX> I certainly wasn't talking to you
[06:44:52] <randomize> well then perhaps you should perpend the nickname of the person you're addressing so as to avoid consufion. It's IRC 101.
[06:45:03] <NodeX> really lol
[06:45:15] <randomize> yes, really. Minus the lol.
[06:45:30] <NodeX> How long have you been IRCing ?
[06:45:54] <randomize> I do however think I'm correct in my character assesment of you though. That much is obvious. Have a grand day mate. I've to work.
[06:46:08] <NodeX> I aint your "mate" bad kid
[06:46:17] <randomize> I *was* correct.
[06:46:33] <NodeX> about you being a bad kid yep
[06:49:24] <Zxurian> NodeX: so i've got the ajax hanlder in place, but I'm getting a 200 status no matter what, even when FireBug is recording the ajax call as 304
[06:49:32] <Zxurian> trying to experience with a jsfiddle right now
[06:49:39] <NodeX> that's the status
[06:49:50] <NodeX> not the response Header .. 1 sec
[06:49:57] <Zxurian> well that's what I would be looking for
[06:50:01] <Zxurian> I assumed anyway
[06:50:15] <NodeX> you can view the resp headers iirc
[06:50:21] <Zxurian> since if it's a 304 status, then the browser will load it from cache, since it's not modified
[06:50:46] <Zxurian> yea, when I run an xhr.getAllResponseHeaders() on the ajax, none of the headers have information on response status
[06:50:55] <Zxurian> that's why I was working off of the status instead
[06:50:56] <NodeX> the ajax "status" is 200 because it's "ok" and has an "ok" form the server
[06:51:07] <Zxurian> bah
[06:51:29] <NodeX> gimme a min i'll knock somehting up
[06:51:47] <Zxurian> that'd be pimp
[06:51:51] <Zxurian> i know i'm missing something stupid
[06:52:23] <amdk6> Hi there, I'm having trouble with the .next() function
[06:52:50] <amdk6> I have a jsfiddle that shows what I want to do if anybody's up for some quick help
[06:52:51] <NodeX> Zxurian : you could allways try "ifModified"
[06:53:04] <amdk6> http://jsfiddle.net/XwcFM/
[06:53:47] <Zxurian> hm....
[06:53:51] <Zxurian> that might work
[06:54:39] <amdk6> I don't understand why my .next() doesn't catch some element
[06:55:41] <Zxurian> amdk6: the .next() function is working off of the child class
[06:55:49] <Zxurian> amdk6: http://jsfiddle.net/XwcFM/1/
[06:56:10] <Zxurian> amdk6: it can't go "next" from .selectA because there's nothing to go "next" to,
[06:56:30] <amdk6> thank you
[06:56:41] <Zxurian> NodeX: goign to epxeriement with the :ifModified method, that might do what I'm looking for
[06:57:03] <Zxurian> NodeX: since checking against the last modified header is essentiallly the same as a 304, since that's what triggers it anyway, righT?
[06:57:08] <NodeX> I think it will ...
[06:57:34] <NodeX> In jQuery 1.4 this technique also checks the 'etag' specified by the server to catch unmodified data.
[06:57:47] <NodeX> not good if you strip Etags though
[06:57:49] <amdk6> That's what I did first (what you just modified) but then all the ".myDiv2" were showing exactly like if I used .nextAll(), that's why I tried too be more precise in the selection :/
[06:58:32] <amdk6> hmm, gonna try to add other .myDiv2 in the jsfiddle and see what happens there before annoying you again
[06:58:59] <Zxurian> amdk6: look at .closest(), it may be what your lookign for instead of .next()
[06:59:06] <Zxurian> NodeX: not stripping any etags that I know of
[06:59:37] <NodeX> some dont some do .. I personaly do fore speed
[06:59:37] <Zxurian> NodeX: just trying to do a simple test to see if an image is being loaded from cache or not, (304 or not), if yes, display immediately, if not, wait 'till finished, then fade in
[06:59:39] <amdk6> Ah, yes, that may do the trick, going to try this, thank you again.
[07:01:35] <SnackWhack> How would I assign a click event to any link with the following href: <A HREF="/pls/test/bwskfreg.P_AltPin"> ?
[07:03:02] <NodeX> err add a class
[07:04:37] <SnackWhack> NodeX - can't add a class. I can't mod the baseline code
[07:05:04] <NodeX> ?contains
[07:05:05] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:06:27] <Zxurian> NodeX: hm... so the ifModified setting is either not working on my local server, or something else is up, becuase it's firing success on every refresh
[07:06:30] <NodeX> $("a[href^=pls/test")
[07:06:35] <jodaro> mornin jqueryers
[07:06:36] <NodeX> $("a[href^=/pls/test")
[07:06:37] <Zxurian> Nodex: which if i'm reading the docs right, it shouldn't do
[07:06:51] <NodeX> check in your net panel
[07:07:00] <NodeX> see the status of the image ...
[07:07:21] <SnackWhack> thx
[07:07:48] <Zxurian> resposne code is 304 according to FireBug: http://gyazo.com/3f0a60d51ca415beb7f5dcfa58c8f5e6
[07:08:58] <NodeX> I don't know then sorry
[07:09:43] <orl> Hi!
[07:09:43] <jodaro> i'm trying to work out an issue with a nested slideshow using cycle: https://gist.github.com/1282833
[07:09:53] <orl> Would need some help about this website: http://www.sebkhachott.net/spip
[07:10:01] <jodaro> if anyone has time to tell me what i'm doing wrong i'd appreciate the help
[07:10:08] <Zxurian> NodeX: no problem, you've helped out enough to at least set me on the track, now just to find out why it's not working
[07:10:35] <orl> I'm using jQuery for navigation, with history.js, and it works fine, but it seems not to be able to load new pages when coming from/going to a page with video/audio markups on them.
[07:12:00] <orl> For example, byt getting on this: www.sebkhachott.net/spip/?rubrique41 and clicking on the (+) just after the word 'obscene'
[07:12:01] <NodeX> I have definately read correct heaqder codes in jquery ajax before so I'm sure it's possible
[07:12:30] <amdk6> Zxurian : Tried .closest() but no success, I added some other div's to show you how it reacts (next() acting as nextAll() )  http://jsfiddle.net/XwcFM/7/
[07:14:53] <singingwolfboy1> I'm building a UI widget (using the $.ui.widget framework) that I want to remain active whenever any element in the widget has focus, but to deactivate as soon as the focus is on an element outside of the widget. How do I do that? Is there a way to determine in a blur() event handler which element currently has focus?
[07:16:06] <NodeX> closest() goes up the dom tree
[07:16:15] <NodeX> try sublings()
[07:16:19] <NodeX> ?siblings()
[07:16:19] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:16:47] <ajpiano> m4xx: that's good news :)
[07:18:37] <ajpiano> singingwolfboy1: bascially, you'd bind a focus handler to the document ... $(document).bind("focus.mywidget", $.proxy( function(e) { if ( !$(e.target).closest(this.el).length) { //focus was outside of widget  } }, this) );
[07:20:41] <Zxurian> amdk6: seems to me you want something more proceedural, not conditional. see http://jsfiddle.net/XwcFM/18/
[07:21:03] <m4xx> ajpiano: feel like looking over my widgetfactory version of my context menu? http://jsfiddle.net/akuWn/
[07:21:23] <ajpiano> m4xx: sure
[07:21:30] <ajpiano> m4xx: i could have pointed this out yesterday as well BUT
[07:21:36] <ajpiano> it's a lot better to use jQuery.noop
[07:21:42] <ajpiano> when you have something that is an optional function
[07:21:49] <ajpiano> this way you don't have to $.isFunction it
[07:22:01] <ajpiano> jQuery.noop == function(){}
[07:22:02] <amdk6> NodeX : thanks, did not know about siblings()
[07:22:16] <amdk6> Zxurian : Perfect ! Thank you ;)
[07:22:36] <ajpiano> m4xx: in _setOption, you only need to do one or the other, one is for 1.8, the other is 1.9
[07:22:36] <Zxurian> no problem
[07:22:51] <amdk6> You're right, the conditional part wasn't really needed afterall
[07:22:59] <falieson> can someone tell me why my e.keyCode is killing == 27 is killing accordion while the e.keyCode == 70 works beuatifully? http://pastebin.com/Hy2WHwxK
[07:23:33] <m4xx> falieson: it will be easier for people to help you if you use http://jsfiddle.net
[07:23:34] <ajpiano> m4xx: i'm confused why you're doing this.element.each(function() { /snip/  })
[07:23:40] <ajpiano> inside of the _create?
[07:23:41] <m4xx> OOPS
[07:23:45] <m4xx> i need to take that out
[07:23:54] <m4xx> that was an attempt of me to find the last clicked element
[07:24:06] <ajpiano> m4xx: def do the $.noop thing, it will save you a bunch of lines of code
[07:24:27] <m4xx> ajpiano: i would just define the functions ad default options instead of null?
[07:24:32] <m4xx> *add
[07:24:38] <ajpiano> yeah, like on_click: $.noop
[07:24:55] <ajpiano> and then you can just always do on_click.call(this) cause you know it's a function
[07:25:06] <ajpiano> guarding against your users passing not-a-function isn't worth the LOC imo
[07:25:34] <m4xx> LOC?
[07:26:01] <coreyman> Hi, in CSS I can refrence an element like this, .state .county { background: #000000; } in jquery I need to be able to do the same thing, how can I do that? ex: this .county
[07:26:17] <ajpiano> m4xx: lines of code
[07:26:21] <m4xx> ahh
[07:26:28] <ajpiano> coreyman: $(this).find(".county")
[07:26:37] <coreyman> ajpiano thank you very much
[07:26:51] <m4xx> ajpiano: what if they pass something other than a function?
[07:27:09] <m4xx> i know they're not supposed to.
[07:27:10] <ajpiano> their app will break
[07:27:21] <ajpiano> and they will very shortly discover that they've passed something invalid
[07:27:42] <ajpiano> which is probably better than you not attempting to call it and them wondering "why isn't my thing happening?
[07:28:53] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/cnpEe/ an someone tell me why my e.keyCode is killing == 27 is killing accordion while the e.keyCode == 70 works beuatifully?
[07:29:41] <DarsVaeda> can I place a file upload onto a button with jquery?
[07:31:03] <Zxurian> hm.. so it's not just me, uploaded to another server and ajax.ifModified is still not kicking in
[07:31:12] <m4xx> ajpiano: would it make sense to keep it for the on_click but use the noop for the before and after callbacks?
[07:31:16] <coreyman> ajpiano how can I first go to the parent element of $(this) ?, and then find(".county");
[07:31:37] <m4xx> $(this).parent().find('.county');
[07:31:41] <ajpiano> coreyman: $(this).parent().find(".county")
[07:31:51] <ajpiano> m4xx: i'd default them all to $.noop
[07:32:00] <m4xx> how would i do so?
[07:32:01] <ajpiano> or provide a default impl of on_click
[07:32:03] <coreyman> ajpiano thank you once again
[07:33:11] <m4xx> the only reason i'm thinking it may be valid there is that i'm thinking of adding a separator menu item.
[07:33:28] <m4xx> ah, perhasp then i should check the type of menu item
[07:33:30] <coreyman> ajpiano is double quotes neccessary or can I use single quotes?
[07:33:59] <ajpiano> m4xx: that separator item could still have an empty function instead of you having to check the type
[07:34:20] <mydoghasworms> I have a problem only in IE8that when I try to make a div (for wait indicator) visible right before calling ajax(), it does not show.
[07:34:27] <mydoghasworms> The same happens if trying to use a dialog.
[07:34:30] <keirlav> if i have a select with 6 options, and 6 hidden divs, how would i go about showing the number of divs that they select from the dropdown?
[07:34:31] <mydoghasworms> In FF, it is fine.
[07:34:48] <ajpiano> coreyman: single vs double quotes doesn't matter in JS, just choose one and stick to it
[07:34:53] <mydoghasworms> I have also seen at least one post about this on StackOverflow, so I know it is not isolated.

[07:38:05] <ajpiano> <3
[07:39:31] <m4xx> ajpiano: should i loop through my menu items and validate them in the _setOption method?
[07:39:46] <m4xx> and apply the $.noop there
[07:41:33] <aple> Is there a way to search the current directory you're in with jQuery?
[07:41:39] <aple> For a particular file
[07:41:50] <ajpiano> you probably need to refactor how you're handling that a bit in general
[07:42:03] <aple> ajpiano: Me?
[07:42:11] <ajpiano> no
[07:42:13] <ajpiano> and no
[07:43:08] <aple> Me this time?
[07:43:15] <ajpiano> m4xx: if i were you, i would focus my attentions on seeing if you could avoid creating the entire menu element and binding up all the handlers on every time it's show
[07:43:38] <ajpiano> aple: yes.  i wasn't answering you initially and you can't browse directories using jQuery
[07:44:21] <aple> Can I include PHP in jQuery?
[07:44:28] <NodeX> no
[07:45:10] <tman> hey, i have a situation where i have a mouseenter event which fadesIn another dom element, which it has a mouseleave event that fires when you mouse off it.. problem is there's another div ontop of that which also fades in, on a higher z-index, which is causing the mouseleave event to fire
[07:45:12] <aple> Any suggestions on how to get a file from a directory into a JS var?
[07:45:17] <tman> how can i prevent this from happening?
[07:45:21] <NodeX> echo it
[07:45:29] <orolo> i'm trying to grab the value of a child attr. something like $('#parent').find( child w/ attr="thisAttr")?
[07:45:40] <aple> NodeX: I can echo PHP in JS?
[07:45:48] <NodeX> var bla = '<?php echo('Something'); ?>';
[07:45:50] <NodeX> yup
[07:45:56] <mydoghasworms> Is the hide() method also asynchronous if you don't pass a delay?
[07:46:29] <NodeX> mydoghasworms : everything is async
[07:46:34] <NodeX> unless you tell it not to be
[07:46:45] <mydoghasworms> How can you do that?
[07:46:53] <mydoghasworms> I know for ajax(), but other methods?
[07:46:55] <aple> NodeX: Awesome. Thanks :)
[07:47:12] <NodeX> $(element).fadeOut(200,function(){alert('I am sync and faded out')});
[07:47:20] <NodeX> yw aple
[07:47:40] <NodeX> you dont njeed to quote it aple if it's an integer
[07:47:43] <solidus-river> is there a way to search the Dom tree for the first parent that matches a certain id?
[07:47:43] <NodeX> need *
[07:48:04] <NodeX> solidus-river : ID's are unique
[07:48:09] <mydoghasworms> NodeX: OK yes, if you wrap the next piece you want to execute in a callback. But that leads to recursive code which can be ugly if you want to do a lot in sequence.
[07:48:13] <NodeX> so $("#myid") ..
[07:48:43] <solidus-river> NodeX, right, i meant class
[07:48:54] <NodeX> add to a queue then mydoghasworms ... make an array and push the funcitons to it and loop it
[07:49:02] <NodeX> $(".class").first();
[07:49:17] <NodeX> or $('.class:first') .. iirc
[07:49:45] <mydoghasworms> NodeX: OK, I think I have seen something using when(), is that what you mean? Can you point me to an easy example?
[07:49:59] <NodeX> yer $.when will do it
[07:50:02] <NodeX> ?when
[07:50:04] <bot-t> NodeX, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[07:50:18] <ajpiano> mydoghasworms: hide should be synchronous when there is not a duration
[07:50:27] <ajpiano> NodeX: try to not tell people things if you aren't sure they are true
[07:50:32] <emanuelx> is there a jquery mobile irc channel?
[07:50:41] <NodeX> 15:50:16] <ajpiano> mydoghasworms: hide "should" be synchronous when there is not a duration
[07:50:52] <NodeX> should lol ..... not sure ... wha ? :P
[07:51:47] <ajpiano> ...
[07:52:16] <mydoghasworms> emanuelx: According to the topic, http://jquerymobile.com
[07:52:32] <mydoghasworms> Sorry, that is the site :~)
[07:52:37] <mydoghasworms> Duh
[07:52:40] <emanuelx> hehe yup
[07:53:29] <kborchers> emanuelx: there is a mobile dev channel - #jquerymobile-dev but for support ?'s this is the place
[07:53:30] <falieson> right now i'm using switcher-panel for my navigation and while I like that all the content is included on the first load, it does not allow a user to have a "back" button nor can a url go to a specific panel. Any suggestions for a clean replacement?
[07:53:33] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/raxFZ/
[07:53:55] <emanuelx> kborchers: oh ok, yeah i just had some problems
[07:54:04] <NodeX> there is no real way to tell if it's truly synchronous or not without a duration because it's so fast
[07:55:04] <mydoghasworms> Why would calling ajax() in IE (IE8 in my case) make my show() ineffective?
[07:55:04] <emanuelx> Jquery-mobile is getting a min-Height from my browser that is too big. I need it inside an iframe, so it shows a scrollbar all the time. Any ideas?
[07:56:12] <NodeX> there is nothing in the source to block the UI from what I can tell so hide() is not synchronous
[07:57:14] <kborchers> mydoghasworms: because your doing something wrong ;) see ?demo
[07:57:14] <bot-t> mydoghasworms, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:57:35] <mydoghasworms> kborchers: It's IE-specific though.
[07:57:59] <mydoghasworms> Works fine in FF
[07:58:24] <m4xx> ajpiano: i'm creating my menu in the _create method and you're right, it is firing for every item in my selector. i thought that _create wasn't supposed to have this functionality while _init does
[07:58:28] <kborchers> ok, but without seeing some code we aren't going to be able to help
[07:58:58] <ajpiano> m4xx: _create and _init work the same in terms of they'll be fired for each element in the set you invoke the widget on
[07:59:20] <ajpiano> m4xx: they're both instance methods of the widget
[07:59:29] <ajpiano> a widget doesn't know what other elements have the widget on it
[07:59:51] <ajpiano> m4xx: if you want to keep track of that, you can use some kind of private variable in the closure
[08:00:41] <ajpiano> (function($) { var widgets = $();   $.widget("foo.bar", {_create: function() { widgets = widgets.add( this.el );  }  })    })(jQuery)
[08:01:47] <aple> Is it possible to animate rotation with jQuery??
[08:03:28] <m4xx> ajpiano: was that last line intended for me?
[08:03:34] <ajpiano> yes
[08:03:39] <ajpiano> pseduo code
[08:04:26] <Mariaa> how do we check if a select list option is checked, with JQuery?
[08:04:58] <NodeX> selected you mean ?
[08:05:58] <jonclark> Mariaa: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[08:06:25] <m4xx> $('#myOption').prop('selected') or maybe $('#myOption').is(':selected') ?
[08:06:59] <NodeX> afaik <options> dont carry Id's
[08:07:02] <Mariaa> NodeX yes
[08:07:04] <m4xx> or to get a list i think it's $('#mySelect').find('option:selected');
[08:07:06] <m4xx> oops
[08:07:35] <NodeX> so you would use $("#selectbox").val() and count the length
[08:07:44] <ajpiano> Mariaa: what reference do you have to the current select box?
[08:07:48] <ajpiano> the element itself, or its value?
[08:07:55] <NodeX> or I way confused lol
[08:08:09] <ajpiano> options are allowed to have IDs, they probably just don't
[08:08:32] <NodeX> Learn summit new every day
[08:09:13] <Mariaa> ajpiano its going to be <select id="all-items">
[08:09:38] <ajpiano> right so that is *not* an OPTION
[08:09:47] <ajpiano> you said you wanted to know if a particular option was selector
[08:09:52] <ajpiano> selected*
[08:10:02] <NodeX> [16:04:56] <NodeX> selected you mean ? .... [16:07:00] <Mariaa> NodeX yes
[08:10:24] <m4xx> ajpiano: sorry for my ignorance but i'm not sure what you were implying with your code.
[08:10:25] <Mariaa> ajpiano yes it will be <option id="item1"></option>
[08:10:46] <ajpiano> m4xx: that's so you can track all the current elements that have the widget applie
[08:11:00] <NodeX> $("#item1").is(":selected")
[08:11:24] <NodeX> [16:07:02] <m4xx> or to get a list i think it's $('#mySelect').find('option:selected'); <-- or that with #item1:selected instead
[08:11:55] <ajpiano> but it matters how the thing you're comparing against was obtained initially
[08:12:00] <Mariaa> ok thanks NodeX,m4xx and ajpiano
[08:12:11] <NodeX> :)
[08:12:49] <Mariaa>  $('#mySelect').find('option:selected'); returns the id of the option selected?
[08:13:02] <ajpiano> no, it returns a jquery object of the option element itself
[08:13:06] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to interrupt a form submission, and then resubmit?
[08:13:16] <paul_irish> ya
[08:13:27] <m4xx> you could set a request timeout i think
[08:13:31] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/5tCp3/6/
[08:13:36] <NodeX> if you want it's value Mariaa just add .val()
[08:14:05] <Mariaa> ah ok
[08:14:09] <NodeX> or easier if you just want the current selected element in a selectbox just use $("#my-select-box").val()
[08:14:45] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, thanks. :)
[08:14:49] <m4xx> ajpiano: can you please elaborate as to why i would tracking each element?
[08:14:55] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, will that recurse?
[08:15:10] <ajpiano> m4xx: something you said implied that that's what you were trying to do
[08:15:14] <ajpiano> maybe i was wrong
[08:15:24] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: i don't believe so, ymmv
[08:15:29] <m4xx> sorry for not being clear ;[
[08:15:37] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, is there any way to be sure?
[08:19:40] <mydoghasworms> How do I get the jQuery version from the console?
[08:19:50] <ajpiano> jQuery.fn.jquery
[08:20:08] <mydoghasworms> Super, thanks.
[08:20:11] <aple> What's the best way to make an image scalable and rotate it? SVG + RaphaelJS?
[08:21:30] <chrisr1386> can someone help me with some syntax that works with 1.4 but not with 1.5 or 1.6?
[08:22:53] <janthony> Instead of using radio buttons for yes or no, I was wanting to make a switch or slider display. Anyone have any reccomended links for doing that? I went to the jquery ui site and didn't see anything out of the box for it.
[08:27:31] <khmer> janthony: http://jqueryui.it/demos/slider ?
[08:27:37] <janthony> Looks like this may be the closest to what I want :http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/checkbox/
[08:27:44] <khmer> or uh http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[08:28:20] <gnarf> that jqueryui.it so pisses me off
[08:28:32] <khmer> yeah what's with its google fu
[08:28:36] <janthony> khmer: I'm looking for an out of the box solution to make my radio buttons look fancy. That example has nothing to do with radio buttons. :P
[08:28:39] <khmer> turns out i only thought i was feeling lucky
[08:28:56] <khmer> janthony: oh, i see. i think of it more in terms of making a form control.
[08:29:11] <janthony> khmer: Yeah, the link I pasted is more of what I'm looking for
[08:30:23] <coreyman> When i clone() a table with a form inside it, all of the name attributes stay the same, they need to be unique, how can I get around this?
[08:30:32] <khmer> janthony: that looks nice! but, also, i linked you to the wrong jquery ui extension. you could also use http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/ on a radio button
[08:31:16] <janthony> khmer: True, that's a good alternative as well.
[08:31:34] <janthony> The link I posted looks kinda buggy, so I'm weary of it.
[08:32:09] <khmer> if you don't want to import all the extra ui assets, which i would understand, it's not hard to write this plugin
[08:32:25] <khmer> it's three events and three classes and one stylesheet and one sprite
[08:35:16] <NodeX> https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/slidify <-- will prolly do what you want
[08:40:26] <NodeX> it's a real shame that html() doesn't have a callback once finished
[08:41:02] <khmer> it's...a...synchronous method?
[08:41:33] <NodeX> apparently it isnt... $("#image-container").html(data); ... $("a.gallery-a").first().click(); doesnt work and in data is 4 a.gallery-a's
[08:42:04] <khmer> can you fiddle it? it sounds like your DOM is breaking
[08:42:14] <NodeX> ajax responses..
[08:42:37] <Daiben_> hello
[08:42:40] <NodeX> 1 sec I'll try to gett the content
[08:42:42] <khmer> oh, your "data" variable is an ajax response?
[08:42:42] <NodeX> get *
[08:42:46] <NodeX> yer
[08:42:49] <khmer> you could use .load()
[08:42:52] <khmer> which does have a callback
[08:42:59] <NodeX> good point..
[08:43:00] <Daiben_> hello is there something wrong with $("#grid").find("td:contains(92)").closest(".button-column").html("123");
[08:43:09] * NodeX slaps forehead
[08:43:26] <NodeX> ?load
[08:43:26] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:44:34] <khmer> Daiben_: i think the :contains selector needs quotes. :contains('92')
[08:44:49] <NodeX> ty ty .. my brain is fried at the end of a long day lol
[08:45:35] <Daiben_> khmer: thats not the problem
[08:46:05] <khmer> then by all means, elucidate
[08:46:53] <Daiben_> khmer: the problem something with the closest
[08:47:20] <khmer> Daiben_: without seeing your DOM that's tough to figure out, but it is an odd thing you're trying to do
[08:47:32] <khmer> Daiben_: you're aware that .closest() looks for ancestors, and not for siblings or descendents, right?
[08:47:37] <codecowboy> I;ve got some code within a $(function(){}); in a separate file which will not run but will run from the firebug console once the page is loaded. jquery 1.6.2 in a Wordpress site. No errors in the firebug console - am stumped :(
[08:48:01] <khmer> codecowboy: are you able to jsfiddle it? that's a very generic question, i'm afraid
[08:49:58] <codecowboy> khmer: not really. I am literally doing $('#post_page').text('test'); in a js file. The div exists and if I run it in the console, the div contents are replaced. If I put the same code in an external file inside a document ready or $(function(){}) it doesn't get called)
[08:50:33] <khmer> codecowboy: you set a breakpoint and it never gets called?
[08:51:11] <codecowboy> khmer: correct
[08:51:34] <khmer> is the breakpoint set inside your function, or at the $() call that is supposed to set the document.ready?
[08:53:41] <codecowboy> khmer: inside
[08:53:45] <Daiben_> khmer: how to find the next td its like <td>92</td><td class="button-column">with some crap</td>
[08:54:30] <khmer> ?next Daiben_

[08:54:39] <khmer> uh, derp
[08:54:44] <khmer> i do not apparently know how to use this bot :)
[08:54:46] <codecowboy> khmer: it WILL break on $(function(){
[08:54:52] <khmer> Daiben_: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:55:02] <khmer> codecowboy: ok, so are you able to switch to the dev version of jquery?
[08:55:22] <khmer> codecowboy: cause what i'd do is pause on that line, and then step into jquery and see what jquery is trying to do
[08:55:41] <codecowboy> khmer yeah i can do that
[08:55:44] <khmer> codecowboy: see if for some reason, perhaps a typo or $ being stolen, it's not setting a docready
[08:55:58] <khmer> `next
[08:56:03] <Daiben_> khmer: you are my hero :P
[08:56:06] <khmer> hmm, doesn't work either :)
[08:56:13] <khmer> Daiben_: the docs are your hero
[08:56:27] <Daiben_> :P
[08:58:20] <khmer> ajpiano: were you at html5tx
[09:00:03] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to interrupt a form submission, and then resubmit?
[09:00:19] <khmer> min|dvir|us: yes, but only if you're not doing anything asynchronous during that time.
[09:00:31] <khmer> min|dvir|us: if you are, you need to cancel the event and then run a submit trigger
[09:00:43] <min|dvir|us> I am. Could you explain further please?
[09:00:45] <khmer> min|dvir|us: if you're not doing anything asynchronous, then it's simple as binding a submit event to that form
[09:01:18] <khmer> min|dvir|us: so, events are synchronous. when you listen to an event, your function fires and receives an event object. you can then prevent the default action (in this case, form submission) by running .preventDefault() on that event
[09:01:29] <khmer> or, in jquery idiom, returning false from the function, although you wouldn't want to do that here
[09:01:41] <codecowboy> khmer:  thanks - how would I know if $ was 'being stolen'?
[09:01:44] <min|dvir|us> khmer, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/492049/
[09:01:50] <min|dvir|us> That's what I have right now.
[09:02:13] <min|dvir|us> With an event.preventDefault right above that.
[09:02:46] <min|dvir|us> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/492051/
[09:02:47] <khmer> codecowboy: $ === jQuery
[09:02:53] <min|dvir|us> Would that work?
[09:02:57] <khmer> min|dvir|us: and that means that the form will never submit!
[09:03:11] <min|dvir|us> khmer, there's a .submit() call in the else.
[09:03:29] <khmer> min|dvir|us: yes, which works fine, usually--although it won't submit the parameter that a "submit" button would have contained.
[09:03:53] <khmer> min|dvir|us: you're doing what you have to do, since you're running a getJSON call
[09:04:19] <khmer> min|dvir|us: if you weren't doing ajax, then you could just modify the form as necessary without ever preventing the default action--since your handler will run completely before the default action happens
[09:04:37] <khmer> min|dvir|us: but since you're doing AJAX, your handler will finish executing before you actually want to submit your form
[09:04:44] <khmer> min|dvir|us: so e.preventDefault() is necessary there
[09:04:54] <min|dvir|us> OK, but this should work not including the submit button.
[09:05:04] <khmer> min|dvir|us: it should work.
[09:05:10] <min|dvir|us> Bitchin'. Thanks. :)
[09:05:13] <khmer> min|dvir|us: provided your controller is not expecting a particular button to be pressed.
[09:05:19] <khmer> which, if you're using django, it shouldn't.
[09:05:21] <khmer> you're welcome
[09:05:46] <min|dvir|us> khmer, well, you can jury-rig a form.
[09:05:59] <khmer> yeah, it's a solvable problem
[09:06:01] <khmer> just ugly
[09:09:59] <red> How can I select all #foo's that aren't .processed?
[09:10:13] <ajpiano> red: your first problem is having more than one #Foo
[09:10:22] <red> bare with me
[09:10:33] <khmer> no thanks, i sunburn
[09:10:46] <red> ajpiano: this isn't working: 'select[id*="foo-bar-baz"]:not(.processed)'
[09:10:56] <ajpiano> red: in principle, $(".foo:not(.bar)")
[09:11:00] <red> that id has some identifers before the foo-bar-baz and afterwarsd, so they are all unique
[09:11:14] <ajpiano> or $(".foo").not(".bar")
[09:11:22] <red> ill try .not
[09:11:23] <ajpiano> red: debug the first part, make sure it's selecting the selects
[09:11:26] <ajpiano> and then do the .not after
[09:12:17] <red> yup
[09:12:53] <red> It's selecting them alright, problem is, I have a function that reruns attaching stuff new to DOM after a trigger (new AJAX content) and it's re-attaching to the ones that are supposed to be already processed
[09:13:24] <ajpiano> right, so what happens when you .not(".processed"), they should be filtered out?
[09:14:01] <red> they should, correct
[09:14:20] <red> but console.log(this) in the start of the .each still shows the elements that are marked processed already
[09:16:01] <red> there has to be some mistake somewhere else hrmph
[09:16:04] <red> *digs deeper*
[09:21:31] <CIDIC> what is the best navigation drop down plugin now/
[09:21:32] <CIDIC> ?
[09:21:44] <neurodrone> Has anyone experienced any issues with jquery datepicker/timepicker Hour slider?
[09:21:47] <NodeX> the one that eats the most cookies
[09:21:51] <NodeX> nomnomnomnomnomnom
[09:22:24] <neurodrone> when "ampm" is marked true, and when you slide the slider over 11:00 am there is an instant between 11:00 am and 12:00pm where it shows "12:00am"
[09:22:38] <neurodrone> so the hour gets incremented but the ampm does not change.. for that instant.
[09:22:44] <neurodrone> is this a noted/fixed bug?
[09:23:03] <NodeX> who knows such things, only the oracle can say for sure
[09:23:13] <neurodrone> :(
[09:24:02] <codecowboy> khmer: it seems like the problem may be that i need to run some jquery code in a popup which is not present at document.ready. is there best practice for this? It's a site I have inherited which is using something called prettyphoto to disaply content in a popup. I want to bind to some mouse events in that popup
[09:24:27] <khmer> codecowboy: is the popup at the same domain?
[09:25:22] <codecowboy> khmer: yep
[09:26:28] <tomasm-> does jquery have a way to duplicate a container somewhere else on the screen and keep any changes to the DOM of the original synced with the second?
[09:27:54] <coreyman> I am trying to change the name attribute of a cloned element before appending the cloned element to the DOM. The name attribute is not changing, http://pastebin.com/BH4bJWF3 what am I doing wrong?
[09:30:40] <shardinator> pls can anyone give me a hand with this? i'm calling a function FB.ui to prompt sharing via Facebook. i keep getting the error - 'FB is undefined' even though it is defined. is my problem synchronousity? "FB is not defined @ http://localhost:8888/share.php:100"
[09:30:59] <coreyman> nvm I got it working
[09:31:37] <min|dvir|us> khmer, you around?
[09:36:42] <tomasm-> hi, how can I change the outer tag of an item to something else?
[09:38:11] <krz> $('#now_viewing ul').prepend('<li><a title="'+data.name+'" target="_blank" href="http://www.foobar.com/'+data.name+'"><img src="'+data.image_url+'" alt="profile image"></a></li>').hide().fadeIn(); looks like its hiding the ul and fading it in. instead, i want it to hide and fade the li
[09:38:15] <krz> how do i go about this
[09:39:04] <ajpiano> krz: $("<ul>...</ul>").hide().prependTo("#now_viewing ul").fadeIn()
[09:39:05] <ragas> how should i go about shifting the starting point of a UL of children? : get the # of children, and loop through removing the last child and inserting before first child.  ?
[09:39:22] <krz> ajpiano: i don't want to hide the ul
[09:39:34] <ajpiano> krz: i meant $("<li>...</li>")
[09:39:49] <krz> ok ill give that a go
[09:41:29] <krz> thanks ajpiano
[09:41:59] <thinkclay> anyone know a fix for .click not working on dynamic elements? I have a menu that is created dynamically and I'm taking the href of that menu item on click and using it to trigger a click event on the ID element itself
[09:42:15] <thinkclay> Works in all browsers but IE8 compat mode or native IE7
[09:42:25] <thinkclay> http://jq-map.chosenclients.com
[09:43:08] <thinkclay> click the Grand Playhouse (big barn on the left) and you'll see a bubble menu, those links are what I'm referring to
[09:43:51] <eugeny> after cleaning a <div> with .empty() and populating it using .html() or .append() several times, the whole page goes slow - slower and slower (reacting on hover for example) with each clean/load
[09:44:07] <eugeny> I think I'm missing some point at which I should do something like cleanup
[09:46:50] <thinkclay> So does anyone see anything out of place http://pastebin.com/hWrrNwfQ on line 645 why this would work in every browser but IE7?
[09:47:38] <diane> so when i run this code http://jsfiddle.net/5x3xh/ i generate two check boxes 'foo' and 'bar', however, when I click on them I get no response in the console or alerts, would anyone have any insite as to why?
[09:48:29] <shardinator> Any ideas about why when i do an onclick="FB.ui();" this is not working?     <script>
[09:48:29] <shardinator>       window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
[09:48:29] <shardinator>         FB.init({
[09:48:30] <shardinator>           appId: '<?php echo $facebook->getAppID() ?>',
[09:48:30] <shardinator>           channelURL : '//../src/channel.html', // Channel File
[09:48:31] <shardinator>           cookie: true,
[09:48:32] <shardinator>           xfbml: true,
[09:48:33] <shardinator>           oauth: true
[09:48:33] <shardinator>         });
[09:48:34] <shardinator>         FB.Event.subscribe('auth.login', function(response) {
[09:48:35] <shardinator>           window.location.reload();
[09:48:35] <shardinator>         });
[09:48:36] <shardinator>         FB.Event.subscribe('auth.logout', function(response) {
[09:48:37] <shardinator>           window.location.reload();
[09:48:37] <rhizmoe> good one
[09:48:37] <shardinator>         });};
[09:48:38] <shardinator>       (function() {
[09:48:38] <shardinator>         var e = document.createElement('script'); e.async = true;
[09:48:39] <shardinator>         e.src = document.location.protocol +
[09:48:39] <shardinator>           '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';
[09:48:40] <shardinator>         document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e);
[09:48:40] <shardinator>       }());
[09:48:41] <shardinator>       
[09:48:44] <diane> :(
[09:49:01] <thinkclay> diane: try a .change event instead of click
[09:49:52] <thinkclay> shardinator: you need to use jsfiddle or pastebin for code, not pasted directly in chat
[09:50:00] <shardinator> thanks, will do
[09:50:08] <diane> hmm using .change instead didn't really change anything
[09:50:11] <shardinator> @thinkclay - my first time
[09:50:20] <thinkclay> shardinator: no problem. :)
[09:50:27] <diane> when I tried that snippet of code without the getJSON code snippet above it, it worked though
[09:50:39] <diane> so idk if i did something wrong somewhere, I'm very new to js/jquery
[09:50:47] <diane> like procedurally in setting up js
[09:51:22] <thinkclay> diane: ahh, then you have a bug in your .getJSON and its getting hung up there (therefore not running the rest of your code) do you know how to use firebug / console?
[09:51:31] <diane> yeah i'm using firebug atm
[09:51:39] <diane> the .getJSON code _appears_ to work
[09:51:50] <diane> it reads in the json file, and creates checkboxes based off it
[09:51:50] <thinkclay> not getting any errors thrown?
[09:51:52] <Danielpk> Lastest jQuery support bind event to SVG items?
[09:51:53] <diane> nope
[09:52:30] <diane> i'm going to take that out and put some checkboxes in html and see
[09:52:34] <thinkclay> oh, change jQuery to $
[09:52:51] <eddiemonge> thinkclay: why?
[09:53:07] <thinkclay> because I hate inconsistencies :)
[09:53:30] <thinkclay> diane: best to stick to one or the other in your code throughought
[09:53:34] <shardinator> any idea why FB.ui is not seen as defined here? http://pastebin.com/qJKCzzE3
[09:53:42] <shardinator> thats better than my last paste
[09:55:15] <eddiemonge> shardinator: so you init fb and then get the script for it?
[09:56:03] <diane> so ok I verified, if i add a checkbox in the html then that code works for that checkbox
[09:56:10] <diane> but not for checkboxes created by my js above
[09:56:13] <shardinator> eddiemonge: I init fb, but i don't want the function to launch on page load so i try to call it with an on click event
[09:56:36] <diane> do i need to like refresh the scripts view of the DOM or something after I've added checkboxes to it?
[09:56:55] <thinkclay> diane: if they're dynamically created use .live('click', function()) instead of .click
[09:57:05] <diane> ah ok
[09:57:53] <eddiemonge> the line after the init is the call to facebook
[09:58:41] <kborchers> diane: don't use live ... use delegate instead see ?delegate
[09:58:41] <bot-t> diane, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:58:45] <shardinator> everything above line 30 works like a charm, so calling Facebook works fine on its own
[09:59:24] <diane> so use delegate instead of live? why is that?
[09:59:52] <shardinator> eddiemonge: everything above line 30 works like a charm, so calling Facebook works fine on its own
[09:59:58] <eddiemonge> shardinator: maybe you should ask fb then since this a jquery channel?
[10:00:30] <shardinator> whats the fb channel pls?
[10:00:45] <shardinator> #fb?
[10:00:46] <kborchers> live is icky ... both of them rely on your event bubbling and then fire your handler ... live waits for everything to bubble to the document but with delegate you can specify a much closer container to bind your handlers to
[10:00:50] <kborchers> diane ^
[10:01:08] <diane> i see i see
[10:01:44] <coreyman> http://pastebin.com/jaKAJ8zj after I clone the element once, it exponentially clones more and more of the same thing. How can i stop it from doing that?
[10:01:50] <coreyman> oops
[10:01:51] <shardinator> found the fb channel
[10:02:04] <coreyman> http://pastebin.com/haKAJ8zj
[10:03:11] <eddiemonge> coreyman: last doesnt really take a selector
[10:03:13] <context> coreyman: uhh, not enough context
[10:04:42] <kggle> if i want to anmiate a div that the div shrinks, it always shrinks from right to left. i want thats go from left to right. any ideas?
[10:04:52] <coreyman> eddiemonge -> http://pastebin.com/bHYysjkC still does it.
[10:05:17] <eddiemonge> i effin hate pastebin.
[10:05:20] <eddiemonge> coreyman: http://pastebin.com/qDNzCcBM
[10:05:43] <coreyman> context how much 'context' do you need? That is the entire code. First time it creates 1 element second time it creates 4 third time it creates 8
[10:05:44] <Danielpk> Any know if jquery can handle events at SVG?
[10:05:56] <context> yeah those are different.
[10:06:13] <context> coreyman: well one you are replicating the last #unitContain not .unitInfo
[10:06:42] <gnarf> $("#unitContain").find(".unitInfo").last().clone()
[10:06:46] <context> $('#unitContain .unitInfo').last().clone().appendTo($('#unitContain'));
[10:06:56] <gnarf> i dunno what this .last($()) bs is
[10:06:58] <gnarf> but it doesnt work
[10:07:15] <coreyman> context ohhh... that would be the problem then. I thought last selected the last child within #unitContain
[10:07:52] <context> "Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set."
[10:07:53] <gnarf> coreyman: also... find($()) makes no sense
[10:08:00] <context> of matched, not children of matched
[10:08:07] <velts> anyeone know how i can do some css 3 transfroms with jquere?
[10:08:13] <context> coreyman: yeah, you are using $() a bit too much
[10:08:17] <gnarf> coreyman: .find( ".wellInterest" ) not .find( $( ".wellInterest" ) )
[10:08:38] <coreyman> gnarf find($('.wellInterest')) works
[10:08:49] <context> also 'troubleshooting' its something handy to try and do
[10:09:24] <gnarf> coreyman: it might work, but its WAY wrong
[10:10:10] <coreyman> gnarf I copied it from the documentation :( I will change it.
[10:10:15] <gnarf> coreyman: no you didn't
[10:10:17] <thinkclay> anyone know why IE7 gets the full url when grabbing .attr('href') rather than just string literal from that attr?
[10:10:23] <gnarf> coreyman: and if you did, point me at the docs page
[10:10:31] <gnarf> coreyman: so i can remove this horrible idea from it
[10:10:39] <coreyman> gnarf one second
[10:10:57] <kborchers> i'll be amazed if that's actually in the docs
[10:11:03] <snover> thinkclay: IE normalizes hrefs injected by innerhtml, there is no way to make it not do that
[10:11:07] <gnarf> thinkclay: all browsers should get the full url with .attr('href')
[10:11:22] <snover> no gnarf, all browsers should get the full url with .prop('href')
[10:11:25] <snover> not .attr
[10:11:28] <gnarf> thanks snover
[10:11:44] <snover> you are so welcome
[10:12:02] <thinkclay> snover: damn, good to know
[10:12:38] <thinkclay> snover: do you have / know of a simple fix?
[10:12:44] <coreyman> gnarf - api.jquery.com/closest the second comment.
[10:12:57] <thinkclay> probably just regex the full path out to get the anchor?
[10:12:59] <snover> thinkclay: read the part of that sentence after the comma :)
[10:13:29] <snover> you haven’t said what you are trying to do so I can’t tell you if there is a way to do it :)
[10:13:47] <gnarf> coreyman: um - the comments are NOT the docs
[10:13:48] <gnarf> :)
[10:13:50] <context> coreyman: comments are NOT docs
[10:13:55] <context> heh gnarf beat me
[10:14:00] <gnarf> coreyman: either way thats a REALLY bad idea to be doing
[10:14:06] <gnarf> coreyman: just use .find( selector )
[10:14:11] <gnarf> or $( selector)
[10:14:22] <coreyman> gnarf i will, but I thought the comments were moderated and that they must be legit :)
[10:14:24] <context> coreyman: and if you notice, that comments goes completely against the docs themselves
[10:15:03] <context> not to mention thats the /only/ comment even that shows closest() being used liek that. that and you're code wasn't using closest()
[10:15:12] <thinkclay> snover: well I just need that anchor w/o the url so I'm thinking i'll just regex the url out
[10:15:45] <coreyman> context ok well that is where I got it from, figured all those related functions could be used like that.
[10:16:26] <coreyman> context do you know if the radio input bug still exists where when it is cloned the last radio state gets removed?.. I am changing the name of all cloned radios so I know that isn't the problem.
[10:17:06] <snover> thinkclay: that is probably the best, yes.
[10:17:31] <context> coreyman: i have no clue what bug that is. its generally good to question 'problems' when you actually have them, not before they happen
[10:17:41] <orentanay> what would be the best way to select all TR tags that contain nothing, including not even having a nested TD? thanks.
[10:17:51] <thinkclay> snover or anyone else have a regex snippet handy to match url but not anchor hash?
[10:17:54] <coreyman> context yes i'm having the problem i'll make a test case and show you.
[10:18:06] <snover> thinkclay: you do have to do *some* of the work yourself :)
[10:18:15] <context> so pull out your console and see if its saving said state? change the state ?
[10:18:20] <ajpiano> orentanay: $("tr:empty") ?
[10:18:30] <coreyman> context i see the problem now
[10:18:32] <orentanay> thanks ajpiano
[10:18:37] <context> your debug console works like mine. it will tell you more than i can from a code paste
[10:19:25] <coreyman> context i am changing the name of the radio AFTER the clone is appended to the DOM, I need to do it BEFORE. how can I do that? my previous paste is the same code I am working with.
[10:21:54] <orentanay> ajpiano:  $("tr:empty") worked great for completly empty tr tags, but what about TR tags that don't contain a td, but may contain a space? I'm dealing w/ a 3rd party CMS that is killing me w/ crap table code.
[10:22:15] <coreyman> Hi all, how can I change the radio button in the clone before I append it to the DOM? pastebin.com/LkRmPFCN
[10:26:31] <coreyman> nvm I got it, thanks.
[10:29:09] <rroelofs> Is there a way to use serializeArray() on a group of form elements?  I want to pass a collection of inputs rather than the form.
[10:29:44] <coreyman> $('.states').change should apply to EVERY element with class .states right?
[10:30:07] <rroelofs> all the ones that trigger a change event
[10:31:09] <monk12> hmmm I would like to use the _renderItem in Jquery UI's Autocomplete to format my autocomplete dropdown, but not sure how to use it in this kind of context: http://jsfiddle.net/uQCsF/ I can't just uncomment the code as it'll break the jquery js
[10:31:15] <coreyman> rroelofs even cloned elements that were later added to the dom?
[10:32:44] <rroelofs> coreyman: no.  you have to use live or delegate in that case
[10:32:48] <monk12> whoops meant to put the comment part before the .end().... still doesn't work anyway
[10:33:13] <coreyman> rroelofs oh i just had to pass true to clonee()so that it copied the event handlers
[10:33:27] <rroelofs> that works fine too
[10:33:34] <context> monk12: the autocomplete guide shows you how to customize the render last i thought
[10:33:48] <coreyman> rroelofs thx for your help though :)
[10:34:35] <context> also, why was i selected instead of just asking the whole room
[10:34:48] <context> err nm
[10:34:50] <context> :/
[10:35:10] <coreyman> context probably because you are intelligent
[10:35:19] <monk12> lol context :)
[10:35:32] <monk12> ... context,  yes i can def do it if i def do it exactly like jquery examples do... find the node i want the autocomplete on then adding the render... like so $('#blah')._renderItem = someFunction(){}  ... but i want to add things onto it
[10:36:10] <monk12> so i can't do this basically: $('#blah')._renderItem = someFunction(){} .find().doStuff().end().find().doStuff();
[10:36:30] <context> uhh
[10:36:42] <context> 'renderItem' not 'renderWhateverTheHellYouWant'
[10:37:34] <context> the wording used for the function name im guessing wasn't randomly pulled out of a bingo ball machine im guessing
[10:38:06] <monk12> whoops... forgot to add autocomplete()... this is the jquery ui example... i know. $( "#project" ).autocomplete().data( "autocomplete" )._renderItem = function( ul, item ) {}; will work though since it doesn't need to work off more stuff at the end....
[10:38:37] <monk12> i was wondering if theres a way to hack that so the _renderItem is added in such a way where it adds the fucntion... but still returns the node so other things can work off it.
[10:38:46] <context> monk12: and im sure you CAN do/get data from other parts of the page (should probably be in the data though)
[10:38:58] <context> what
[10:39:31] <context> maybe you should ask what you are actually trying to do. not try to do what you think a proper solution is
[10:42:18] <monk12> Gotcha. well, i create 3 autocompletes on a node i dynamically created.... $('#someCopiedDiv').css('display','block').find('.companies').autocomplete().end().find('.services').autocomplete().end().find('.city').autocomplete();
[10:43:21] <monk12> i want to now customize the drop down themselves... If i wasn't doing it dynamically and only had 1 autocomplete, you can just add the _renderItem at the end of the .autocomplete() part.
[10:44:31] <monk12> i left out the autocomplete options like "source: jsonString, ... etc"  in the code for brevity.
[10:44:52] <mydoghasworms> Oh man, I see now what everyone was on about with that jquery.it! I didn't realize, but it comes out on the top of the Google search!
[10:46:07] <monk12> mydoghasworms, whats jquery.it, some new site that takes up high jquery google ranking but doesn't display anything?
[10:46:30] <mydoghasworms> monk12: Sorry, I mean jqueryui.it
[10:46:51] <ajpiano> it's an illicit site that is trying to scam some jive off jquery by hosting all our content but broken
[10:46:57] <monk12> lol.
[10:47:05] <keirlav> if i have json that reads -  {"message":"Your registration for the Christmas Party on December 11th has been received, we look forward to seeing you at the event, thank you!"}
[10:47:06] <monk12> can they shut it down?
[10:47:26] <keirlav> why wont $('#feedback').text(data.message); work
[10:47:35] <keirlav> div id feedback is present on the page by the way
[10:47:35] <mydoghasworms> ajpiano: What means "scam some jive off"? That must be some colloquial term.
[10:47:55] <keirlav> when i try to log data.message i get undefined
[10:48:02] <monk12> keirlav, is data.message in your getJSON callback function?
[10:48:45] <monk12> keirlav, does Firefox Firebug show that valid JSON def returned (with JSON header and all, should be an extra tab in the Console request saying JSON and show the pair of values)?
[10:49:03] <monk12> whats your basic code look like.
[10:49:13] <monk12> if you can post on jsfiddle.net
[10:49:21] <ajpiano> mydoghasworms: they are trying to make some ad money via SEO and black hat tactics

[10:51:45] <rhizmoe> flood it off the net i say
[10:52:25] <defendguin> where can you find a list of all the classes you can add to inputs to work with the validation plugin?
[10:57:47] <keirlav> sorry found the problem, my php wasn't returning a proper json obj
[10:58:05] <keirlav> had to use parseJSON on what was being returned before i could access it
[10:58:08] <mydoghasworms> Is there a separate channel for jQuery UI?
[10:58:12] <monk12> cool.
[10:58:22] <defendguin> i've got some sort of an issue where the validation is always returning true even though no fields are filled out.  i thought that all i had to do was add the required class to the input tags
[10:58:24] <monk12> yes, but i think its pretty dead #jquery-ui
[10:58:33] <monk12> haven't seen a post in an hour
[10:58:41] <ajpiano> monk12: there isn't
[10:58:44] <ajpiano> this is the channel
[10:59:13] <monk12> i guess there is only 20 peeps there currently. there is a #jquery-ui though. not official?

[11:14:41] <karega|aniasis> using $.tmpl() can it do math operations
[11:20:20] <gnarf> just fyi karega|aniasis - $.tmpl() is End of Life already
[11:21:35] <pvgrif> is there a way to get the DOM element that its at a given coordinate?
[11:23:10] <karega|aniasis> gnarf, why do you say that?
[11:23:37] <gnarf> karega|aniasis: because its not being updated anymore: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[11:23:48] <xr--> ?
[11:24:03] <gnarf> karega|aniasis: feel free to use it, but its not being maintained anymore
[11:25:18] <mydoghasworms> monk12: Thanks. Just been to #jqueryui, and that is NOT happening! :-)
[11:25:30] <eddiemonge> nope its not
[11:25:35] <eddiemonge> ask here
[11:27:06] <mydoghasworms> When I create a dialog from an existing DOM node, does it create a new node in the DOM? Can I specify where in the DOM it gets attached?
[11:27:21] <gnarf> mydoghasworms: there is no #jqueryui - or at least its not "official" :)
[11:27:49] <gnarf> mydoghasworms: have you experienced something regarding this?
[11:27:56] <gnarf> mydoghasworms: cuz that sounds really easily testable
[11:28:22] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure it just puts the div for the dialog in a div attached to the body?
[11:28:44] <mydoghasworms> Well yes, it seems as if it inserts something in the body, because when I switch to another page loaded via ajax, the stupid dialog is still there!
[11:29:01] <mydoghasworms> In fact, let me Firebug that quickly.
[11:30:21] <mydoghasworms> gnarf: Yes, it does in fact create a new DOM node somewhere in the <body>
[11:30:35] <gnarf> mydoghasworms: if you .dialog("destroy") it should clean up
[11:31:27] <mydoghasworms> gnarf: Tried that. But it's still there.
[11:31:50] <ajpiano> close: function() { $(this).dialog("destroy").remove(); }
[11:32:37] <mydoghasworms> ajpiano: Let me try quickly...
[11:34:16] <ViRUS> I'm having some troubles using jquery ui droppable. I've got a target element that needs to grow on hover (it's essentially a shortcut bar that's hidden most the time). Now that bar has elements that are droppables as well. When setting the droppables greedy the outer element doesn't receive the hover class when dragging over an item. When set non-greedy the container and not the contained element receives the drop event. Is there a way to propagate
[11:34:16] <ViRUS>  an drop event to the child element?
[11:35:04] <mydoghasworms> ajpiano: No, that DOM node is still there, and on load of the new page via ajax, it appears again.
[11:35:14] <ajpiano> that doesn't even make sense
[11:35:22] <ajpiano> it doesn't make the div stay in the dom after a new page load
[11:35:34] <ajpiano> unless it's being created again on the next page load
[11:35:36] <mydoghasworms> No, part of the page is reloaded.
[11:35:40] <ProLoser|Work> is $.map() the best way to change every string in an array?
[11:35:42] <mydoghasworms> via xhr
[11:35:52] <ajpiano> why would that get rid of the dialog?
[11:36:58] <mydoghasworms> It's like this: a page is loaded into a div via XHR that generates a dialog. The dialog inserts a node in the DOM outside of that div. When a new page is loaded via xhr, the DOM node for the dialog is still there.
[11:37:12] <mydoghasworms> For some reason, it shows up though (becomes visible).
[11:37:20] <mydoghasworms> If it didn't do that, I wouldn't actually mind
[11:37:42] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question
[11:37:43] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/EhUkF/
[11:37:46] <ProLoser|Work> this doesn't work
[11:37:58] <ProLoser|Work> the array of resourceNames does not have the jv.Resources at the beginning
[11:38:05] <mydoghasworms> I thought I remembered that there was an option to specify where in the DOM the dialog will be placed, but I remember now (I think) that it was for qtip.
[11:38:13] <ProLoser|Work> should i just supplement the resourceNames array with strings, or do i need to actually refer to the objects?
[11:39:00] <ProLoser|Work> arm, i mean… i need help fixing that paste
[11:39:02] <ProLoser|Work> any thoughts
[11:40:25] <mydoghasworms> Even after the new page is loaded and the dialog is still there, I can't even get rid of it.
[11:40:40] <ProLoser|Work> here: http://jsfiddle.net/EhUkF/1/
[11:40:44] <ProLoser|Work> can anyone help me get this to work?
[11:40:54] <ProLoser|Work> the problem is that the methods i need to apply aren't located in the global scope
[11:41:11] <ajpiano> mydoghasworms: if you have a reference to the element... $("#whatever").dialog("destroy").remove() should work from anywhere
[11:42:09] <bluenavajo> hi folks
[11:43:06] <mydoghasworms> I think what I need to do is move the definition of the dialog node out of my loaded pages and into the container page. I wonder whether it attaches some reference to the inserted dialog. Because I am trying what you say from the console (and in the code), and it ain't workin'.
[11:43:11] <mydoghasworms> Going to try that quickly.
[11:52:39] <ProLoser|Work> i can't figure out why this isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/EhUkF/2/
[11:52:50] <mydoghasworms> With regard to my problem earlier with the dialog that wasn't showing with the ajax() request (only in Internet Explorer), I finally found the answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6934736/jqueryui-dialog-does-not-open-until-ajax-call-completes-ie-only
[11:53:34] <ProLoser|Work> you had async = false?
[11:53:56] <ProLoser|Work> that's not an ie bug lol
[11:57:02] <nickadeemus2002> hey, quick question about coding practices...
[11:57:26] <bluenavajo> I have a problem with a little arrow which I need for a top navigation. If you look at http://lens-search.de/ketter/ there is the top navigation. If you click a little white arrow should be right under the menu item. My problem is that I can't get it right, it is never centered under the menu point. For now it's roughly positioned with jquery's offset method. http://jsfiddle.net/CTQLB/ this is
[11:57:27] <bluenavajo> the responsible js code for the current version. Does anyone know an approach to fix this? I would be very glad, because I'm really stuck there.
[11:57:46] <nickadeemus2002> is it a good practice to do this:  $jquerystuff = $('.mySelectorCLass');
[11:58:07] <nickadeemus2002> where $jquerystuff stores a jquery object and has a $ in front.
[11:58:28] <Brodingo> yeah
[11:58:30] <nickadeemus2002> is it a good idea to do this?  do most jquery devs do this?
[11:58:44] <Brodingo> if it helps it helps
[11:59:18] <ajpiano> ?$prefix
[11:59:19] <bot-t> It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[11:59:53] <nickadeemus2002> ok
[11:59:56] <ViRUS> http://jsfiddle.net/PHQHb/3/ -- I want my nested droppable to accept the element and the #container to ignore the droppable when it is dropped on the nested droppable. When using greedy:true this causes the container to close as soon as the nested element receives the hover event.
[12:00:11] <nickadeemus2002> and the problem with Hungarian Notation is ??? : )
[12:01:09] <Brodingo> that was more for typing nickadeemus2002 whereas in js its too loose to be effective
[12:01:14] <ViRUS> nickadeemus2002, I use this sometimes when having two variables: $element stores the jq object and element the plain DOM element.
[12:01:28] <Brodingo> theres a twss in there somewhere
[12:02:28] <nickadeemus2002> ok, sounds good.
[12:02:40] <nickadeemus2002> yeah, the issue i have it using that notation with other libraries
[12:02:54] <nickadeemus2002> that also use $
[12:03:18] <nickadeemus2002> so i'm going through tons of code to determine whether $foo and $bar is a jquery object, or
[12:03:23] <nickadeemus2002> another library variable.
[12:03:35] <nickadeemus2002> thanks for all the information.
[12:06:08] <monk12> is there a way for Jquery UI Autocomplete to show the label and set the value as another? I tried using JSON [{label:"Philadelphia (PHL)", value:"PHL"},"San Francisco (SFO)", value:"SFO"}] but it keeps setting label as the input value.
[12:07:17] <xr--> ?
[12:08:35] <monk12> So the autocomplete drop down shows San Francisco (SFO) but when you click on it it set the text to just the value: SFO
[12:09:12] <cruxst> ajpiano: quick question
[12:09:12] <monk12> guess i need to select event to set it ... let me try it out
[12:09:15] <karega|aniasis> gnarf, I thought tmpl was being rolled into croe
[12:09:17] <karega|aniasis> core
[12:09:35] <ajpiano> cruxst: ok
[12:09:37] <cruxst> ajpiano: i wanna remove jquery completely with noConflict(true)
[12:09:47] <ajpiano> that's not "removing jQuery"
[12:09:54] <cruxst> ajpiano: but there are plugins that have (jQuery) at the end
[12:10:03] <karega|aniasis> ajpiano, is $.tmpl being rolled into core?
[12:10:05] <cruxst> ajpiano: I dont wanna modify them
[12:10:09] <ajpiano> karega|aniasis: no
[12:10:28] <ajpiano> cruxst: you don't want there to be a window.jQuery anymore, but you want scripts to use a window.jQuery?
[12:10:32] <ajpiano> sounds irreconcilable
[12:10:33] <cruxst> ajpiano: its actually var $myjq = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[12:10:45] <cruxst> ajpiano: correct!
[12:10:48] <karega|aniasis> the docs say it is in 1.4 +
[12:10:59] <eddiemonge> karega|aniasis: its not
[12:11:07] <piklu> wazz up guys
[12:11:07] <eddiemonge> which docs are you referring to?
[12:11:32] <cruxst> ajpiano: that's what plugins do by default, right? (Use window.jQuery)
[12:11:54] <ajpiano> cruxst: this caveat is explained in the docs for noconflict(true)
[12:11:59] <karega|aniasis> so $.tmpl() doesn't work in 1.6.x
[12:12:03] <cruxst> ajpiano: right now
[12:12:06] <cruxst> *on
[12:12:10] <ajpiano> If necessary, we can free up the jQuery name as well by passing true as an argument to the method. This is rarely necessary, and if we must do this (for example, if we need to use multiple versions of the jQuery library on the same page), we need to consider that most plug-ins rely on the presence of the jQuery variable and may not operate correctly in this situation.
[12:12:21] <ajpiano> karega|aniasis: that's not true
[12:12:27] <ajpiano> it should probably work
[12:12:32] <mydoghasworms> ajpiano: Well, having moved the dialog <div> out of the xhr-loaded pages and into the container page has made a difference. It seems that it does insert some reference into there which ties it to the new element that is inserted into the DOM. At least now I can get a handle on it.
[12:12:51] <karega|aniasis> should probably is alot if room for error
[12:12:53] <cruxst> ajpiano: thing is that docs dont say what the strategy should be then
[12:12:55] <eddiemonge> kara tmpl is a plugin. itll work if you include it
[12:13:18] <karega|aniasis> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[12:13:27] <mydoghasworms> ajpiano: You seem to be the go-to person for everything here. Are you one of the jQuery developers?
[12:13:29] <cruxst> ajpiano: i have to do this because of a conflict with unremovable previous jquery version
[12:13:33] <karega|aniasis> that says 1.4.3 is that wrong?
[12:13:38] <ajpiano> mydoghasworms: i'm the developer relations lead for the proj
[12:13:53] <ajpiano> karega|aniasis: good lord, that is ... wow
[12:14:18] <karega|aniasis> huh?
[12:14:19] <ajpiano> i'll get that fixed
[12:14:26] <ajpiano> it's wrong, it's not "in 1.4.3"
[12:14:30] <eddiemonge> karega|aniasis: it is. its a plugin that used 1.4.3
[12:14:59] <singingwolfboy1> I'm trying to code an event handler so that the last thing is does is set the focus on a different element, which should call the focus event handlers on that element — but I can't seem to set the focus at all
[12:15:04] <singingwolfboy1> latest jQuery on Chrome
[12:15:10] <singingwolfboy1> is this expected/normal?
[12:16:46] <ajpiano> cruxst: i'm not sure there's anything besides "modify the plugins"
[12:17:09] <ajpiano> cruxst: the idea that somehow there's code that is fundamentally incompatible with newer versions of jquery doesn't jibe
[12:17:47] <ajpiano> jquery hasn't changed *that* much that most apps won't conform to a new version in at most a couple hours of debugging
[12:18:09] <khmer> the last majorly breaking change was what, .prop()? and that wasn't breaking?
[12:18:44] <JesseGreathouse> hi
[12:18:59] <JesseGreathouse> im just going to say my problem if anyone can help thats great
[12:19:13] <ViRUS> Ok, finally got a complete test case for what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/PHQHb/5/ - any ideas anyone?
[12:19:53] <cruxst> ajpiano: it's the platform contrains, cant fix/remove old plugins and jquery but need to use 1.6
[12:20:25] <khmer> JesseGreathouse: that's the way to go about it
[12:20:27] <cruxst> ajpiano: thank you sir
[12:21:30] <JesseGreathouse> Im using the jqueryui tab widget. I am trying to use cookie persistence and loading the tabs with ajax. Both of that works fine when I refresh the browser, however when I the content changes via $.load to reload the tabs, a new cookie is created and the tabs dont stick.
[12:22:02] <JesseGreathouse> Im not using "selected"
[12:22:29] <Spadeski> sup
[12:23:22] <monstaRtruck> sap
[12:23:33] <monstaRtruck> wats new ppl
[12:26:34] <JesseGreathouse> Here is my code if anyone has any ideas. Im reloading this every time with the datepicker and every time its reloaded with .load it creates a new cookie instead of using the original cookie
[12:26:35] <JesseGreathouse> http://pastie.org/2690642
[12:27:58] <khmer> JesseGreathouse: you should destroy the tabs before attempting to create them!
[12:28:03] <khmer> JesseGreathouse: that way, you won't double up on cookies
[12:28:12] <JesseGreathouse> hmm interesting ok
[12:30:21] <ProLoser|Work> could anyone help me get this working?
[12:30:31] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/EhUkF/2/ i'm only passing strings to apply(), i need to be passing function calls
[12:31:22] <ProLoser|Work> or i suppose the promise() respnoses
[12:31:35] <context> wouldn't you want call() ?
[12:32:52] <ProLoser|Work> i don't think that would change it, and no, i want to pass the params as an array
[12:33:43] <context> nm they are pretty much the same
[12:33:51] <mydoghasworms> ajpiano: I managed to resolve my problem with the dialog. It seems that the best thing in the end was to compose a node on the fly each time instead of relying on an existing DOM node. I think the destroy+remove will help in this regards. Thanks!
[12:34:16] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/EhUkF/3/
[12:34:32] <context> proloser|work: Resources is an object. not a Function
[12:34:58] <ajpiano> mydoghasworms: yeah, that's what i discovered as well
[12:35:00] <ProLoser|Work> do objects not have context?
[12:35:03] <ajpiano> that's how i always use it
[12:35:22] <ProLoser|Work> thanks aj
[12:35:43] <context> proloser|work: uhh... except what are calling apply() on.. ?
[12:35:44] <JesseGreathouse> hhmer is this the right way to do it? http://pastie.org/2690701
[12:35:57] <khmer> context: he's calling apply on the .when() method of jquery
[12:36:25] <khmer> it's a neat trick
[12:36:46] <context> oh
[12:36:49] <khmer> JesseGreathouse: perfect! does that clear things up?
[12:37:25] <ClashCityKing> Anyone have issues doing cascading pulldowns with iOS 4 and 5?
[12:37:38] <JesseGreathouse> no its still creating a new cookie when reload the div with .load
[12:38:12] <khmer> JesseGreathouse: hmm, ok. are you running that .tabs('destroy') method on each .load?
[12:38:50] <pvgrif> can i get an element's top pixels if its top property is auto?
[12:41:04] <context> pvgrif: try it ?
[12:41:22] <pvgrif> hmm i did
[12:41:42] <pvgrif> with css("top")
[12:41:45] <pvgrif> that doesnt work
[12:41:50] <pvgrif> i was asking if its possible
[12:42:42] <etcetera> what's a good visual html editor for mac?
[12:43:18] <ClashCityKing> Anyone have issues doing cascading pulldowns with iOS 4 and 5? Specifically the "Next" button
[12:43:19] <etcetera> something that uses webkit and supports javascript editing.
[12:43:34] <xp_prg2> vi
[12:43:43] <xp_prg2> etcetera use vim
[12:43:50] <etcetera> xp_prg2: no.
[12:43:52] <etcetera> next?

[12:46:09] <ProLoser|Work> that shit burns my eyes
[12:47:02] <ProLoser|Work> etcetera: phpedit, bbedit, textmate, aptana, iguana, netbeans
[12:47:03] <pvgrif> context: i get "auto" when i try to get it with css? do you know of anything that could work?
[12:47:48] <ajpiano> pvgrif: use offset().top or position().top
[12:48:03] <ajpiano> depending on if you want relative to document or to its offsetParent
[12:48:49] <pvgrif> ajpiano: thanks, it works perfectly

[12:56:45] <shirmp> the alert is okay if i set the id to for example "test"
[12:57:45] <eddiemonge> youre tr doesnt have an id
[12:57:49] <ClashCityKing> anyone know any work arounds for the "next" button for mobile safari?
[12:57:52] <eddiemonge> your divs do
[12:58:10] <eddiemonge> ClashCityKing: what do you mean?
[12:58:17] <ClashCityKing> i have two pulldowns
[12:58:22] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[12:58:22] <ClashCityKing> changing one changes the other
[12:58:24] <ClashCityKing> normal stuff
[12:58:35] <jiggliemon> Is there a generic animation function in jQuery (that's not tied to any dom elements) ?
[12:58:42] <ClashCityKing> but when the next button is used in mobile safari it acts weird
[12:58:58] <ClashCityKing> it jumps a form element and doesn't correctly fire off the onChange event or doesn't do it in a timely manner
[12:59:18] <ProLoser|Work> is my use of this.deferreds incorrect? http://jsfiddle.net/EhUkF/4/
[12:59:27] <mbtez> how do i find all bindings that are attached to an object?
[12:59:40] <mbtez> i mean 'object in DOM', whatever the word is
[12:59:43] <mbtez> element
[13:00:38] <eddiemonge> jiggliemon: you mean other than see ?.animate()
[13:00:39] <bot-t> jiggliemon, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:01:12] <jiggliemon> eddiemonge: bot-t I want to animate two elements at the same time (with different css properties)
[13:01:28] <jiggliemon> and have them both under the same animation queue
[13:02:02] <jiggliemon> Right now I have them both fighting for place in the event loop, when they should really be under the same function.
[13:02:17] <eddiemonge> mbtez: .data('events')
[13:02:19] <ClashCityKing> eddiemonge: any idea? just looking to see if this is a known issue or if there's a work around
[13:03:15] <mbtez> mmn..fascinating
[13:03:18] <mbtez> thanks you're a lifesaver
[13:03:24] <eddiemonge> jiggliemon: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3642385/how-to-animate-two-things-at-the-same-time-in-jquery
[13:03:30] <mbtez> now to figure out why they're not gettign bound...
[13:04:07] <eddiemonge> ClashCityKing: no idea.
[13:04:16] <ClashCityKing> eddiemonge: okay, thanks
[13:04:23] <jiggliemon> eddiemonge: I read that.  But I'm looking to put two elements into the SAME animation.
[13:04:38] <eddiemonge> ClashCityKing: maybe ask in #jquerymobile or in an ios specific channel?
[13:04:43] <jiggliemon> I'll look some more.
[13:04:52] <eddiemonge> jiggliemon: what do you mean?
[13:05:22] <jiggliemon> let me make a quick example
[13:05:45] <ClashCityKing> eddiemonge: thanks
[13:07:44] <jiggliemon> eddiemonge: something that might resemble this: http://jsfiddle.net/jiggliemon/Sy6Mu/
[13:08:37] <jiggliemon> that's actually a poor example cause it negates any sort of performance enhancements you'd get.  but the idea is there
[13:09:46] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/Sy6Mu/1/ ?
[13:10:37] <jiggliemon> this is more like it: http://jsfiddle.net/jiggliemon/Sy6Mu/2/
[13:10:48] <karega|aniasis> well was Microsoft releasing a templating plugin?
[13:11:15] <jiggliemon> the two elements don't move smoothly (together)
[13:11:22] <jiggliemon> let me get the example
[13:12:25] <Eax> Hey there, I have a div box with some more divs inside it, what I want to do is, in a loop, clone that div, insert some data into the clone and then do that all over again (with the original div, not the new one) - Can someone point me to an example of this please? :)
[13:12:39] <eddiemonge> karega|aniasis: they were the ones doing most of the work on tmpl
[13:12:52] <itanex> hello
[13:13:17] <eddiemonge> Eax: do the work and then clone it
[13:13:37] <Eax> eddiemonge: Wouldn't the next clone take that data with it too?
[13:13:41] <Eax> Oh, it'd overwrite it
[13:13:43] <Eax> How silly of me
[13:13:44] <Eax> Thanks!
[13:14:20] <itanex> can someone point me to the interface details of the jqXHR i am having trouble finding them
[13:14:41] <itanex> something that describes the fields/methods that i can interact with on it
[13:15:17] <eddiemonge> itanex: you mean like ajax stuff? like http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:15:45] <Eax> eddiemonge, Thanks though :)
[13:16:00] <itanex> eddiemonge yes... except i want to know what the jqXHR object that is talked about on that page looks like
[13:16:06] <jiggliemon> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/jiggliemon/P66vW/3/
[13:16:12] <airstrike> hi. is it bad practice to $.ajax({url: document.location ...}); to get additional data?
[13:16:19] <jiggliemon> Look at the borders, and how they're inconsistent.
[13:16:36] <jiggliemon> airstrike: ues.
[13:16:44] <jiggliemon> yes
[13:17:30] <eddiemonge> itanex: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[13:17:53] <eddiemonge> airstrike: how so?
[13:18:30] <eddiemonge> jiggliemon: comma first? really?
[13:18:40] <jiggliemon> :)
[13:19:03] <airstrike> @eddiemonge i'm not sure what you mean by 'how so?'
[13:19:13] <airstrike> i believe it could be bad practice because it effectively breaks the back button
[13:19:21] <airstrike> instead of going back one page, i see the json data
[13:19:32] <CannedCo_> guys, what am i doing wrong here… getting a missing
[13:19:36] <CannedCo_> ":" error, http://jsfiddle.net/Mrgee/
[13:19:40] <CannedCo_> sorry for the extra return there
[13:20:09] <jiggliemon> airstrike: You really don't want to force your javascript to have to rely knowing it's domain.
[13:20:30] <ajpiano> CannedCo_: { code }  is not a function, nor is it an object
[13:20:37] <jiggliemon> You should have some sort of object that handles that for you.
[13:20:43] <eddiemonge> airstrike: i mean explain your question in more detail
[13:21:15] <airstrike> i have a page that needs to load some cpu intensive data, namely computing a lot of values server-side to return a 300x60 table that i dynamically generate
[13:21:25] <eddiemonge> jiggliemon: that example is a bit too complex. im not sure what im looking at in it
[13:21:37] <karega|aniasis> eddiemonge, why did dev stop on the plugin?  There are open issues I see in  GIT
[13:21:51] <eddiemonge> karega|aniasis: who said it stopped?
[13:21:53] <jiggliemon> just check out the result, how when it resizes, the black border isn't a consistent 10px thick.
[13:22:08] <jiggliemon> it juggles @1-2-3px
[13:22:11] <ajpiano> karega|aniasis: read the readme here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[13:22:13] <airstrike> in order to prevent timeouts, i now load an semi-empty page with an $.ajax() call on load, which then fetches data from the very same page.. except when the request has a XHR header, the server knows to return json data instead of regular html
[13:22:30] <jiggliemon> it's a result of having two elements in separate intervals.
[13:22:54] <jiggliemon> I want to put both (or more) elements into the same interval
[13:23:14] <ProLoser|Work_> hallo
[13:23:15] <eddiemonge> airstrike: thats perfectly acceptable, just be sure to let the user know something is happening
[13:23:18] <ProLoser|Work_> anyone use spine or backbone?
[13:23:21] <karega|aniasis> ajpiano, so it is being rolled into jqUI
[13:23:36] <ProLoser|Work_> i want to know how i can have views make use of .load() for most of their content
[13:23:39] <karega|aniasis> Well that is what I mean earlier
[13:23:40] <CannedCo_> ajpiano does it need to be?
[13:23:51] <airstrike> @eddiemonge the user knows that. the problem is that whenever i hit the back button after loading the data with $.ajax(), i don't go back one page, instead I see the json data..
[13:24:18] <airstrike> @eddiemonge or, for example, if i close and reopen firefox, when it reloads the previously used tabs, it reloads the json data instead of the full page
[13:24:34] <airstrike> 'view source' also shows me the json data instead of showing the .html source..
[13:24:45] <airstrike> it's as if firefox believed it was a different page altogether, for some reason
[13:26:28] <airstrike> my ajax call is as simple as this: https://gist.github.com/1285409
[13:28:55] <melkornemesis> hi guys
[13:29:35] <airstrike> any pointers would be *greatly* appreciated
[13:29:58] <eddiemonge> airstrike:  why not use window.location.href
[13:30:03] <melkornemesis> please, how can i get from getJSON callback to element, which triggered this callback?
[13:30:37] <eddiemonge> melkornemesis: elements dont trigger getJSON
[13:31:24] <melkornemesis> eddiemonge: event, sorry
[13:31:25] <melkornemesis> http://kodo.ameoto.com/0164310168 .. at line 4 i need to get the element from line 1
[13:31:30] <melkornemesis> cause i need to work with him
[13:33:02] <melkornemesis> eddiemonge: oh, i get it
[13:34:13] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use spine or backbone?
[13:34:49] <ProLoser|Work> i want this.el to be loaded using $.load()
[13:35:53] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: render: function() { $( this.el ).load("whatever");  return this; }
[13:36:11] <ProLoser|Work> the el element doesn't exist on the page
[13:36:17] <ProLoser|Work> should i change that
[13:36:43] <ProLoser|Work> like, make el the top element that does already exist before .load()
[13:36:59] <defendguin> can someone look at this and tell me why my validations aren't working   http://pastie.org/2691036   in the $('#btnSave').click event $("#aspnetForm").valid() always seems to be true
[13:37:20] <PlzHelp> Hi All
[13:37:29] <Elephant> I like your nick
[13:37:40] <Elephant> but I'm about to leave my desk...
[13:37:42] <Elephant> so torn
[13:37:48] <airstrike> using window.location.href changes nothing
[13:37:53] <eddiemonge> melkornemesis http://jsfiddle.net/dcbtx/
[13:37:56] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: not "make it"
[13:38:07] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: that's how it works... views have a this.el
[13:38:24] <PlzHelp> Can anyone help me get this jquery validate plugin issue working http://jsfiddle.net/ThcS8/1/
[13:38:26] <PlzHelp> ?
[13:38:51] <defendguin> PlzHelp: i'm having issues with the validate plugin as well
[13:38:52] <PlzHelp> My goal is to have the Yes radio required but also to generate an error if the user selects no
[13:39:12] <PlzHelp> Hah that makes two of us
[13:39:15] <eddiemonge> airstrike: do you have a live example? there is other stuff going on in your code that is affecting the history state
[13:39:22] <melkornemesis> eddiemonge: thank you man, you save the day :)
[13:39:35] <eddiemonge> defendguin: thats a lot of code to sift through
[13:40:09] <defendguin> the little bit that matters starts at line 184 eddiemonge
[13:40:21] <dcarper> PlzHelp: you need to use label elements rather than just text after the inputs, and float everything to the left
[13:40:45] <PlzHelp> Hmm ok I can do that
[13:40:53] <PlzHelp> Will that solve my issue?
[13:41:05] <dcarper> PlzHelp: yep :)
[13:41:07] <eddiemonge> PlzHelp: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ThcS8/18/
[13:41:37] <airstrike> i do have an example, but the information is classified, unfortunately..
[13:41:44] <eddiemonge> dcarper: the first part of your statement was correct but the floats arent required
[13:41:47] <CannedCo_> hey guys if you are adding/removing classes on mouse enter and mouse leave and you want it to happen only on the object that triggered the enter/leave, like on a blog that individual post not all the posts, how do you apply add/remove class to the object that triggered the event
[13:41:48] <airstrike> i'm implementing $.pjax() instead of ajax
[13:41:52] <airstrike> and i think that will solve the problem
[13:42:00] <eddiemonge> airstrike: what is that?
[13:42:01] <CannedCo_> can you say this.".text"
[13:42:02] <DualDetroit> OH! OH! OH!!! YEAH, YOU KNOW IT!!!!
[13:42:20] <DualDetroit> Dual Detroit be in da HOOOOOOOOOOOO-WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW-SE.
[13:42:25] <chovy> what happens if the jquery library is not loaded before $ is used?
[13:42:27] <airstrike> @eddiemonge the best thing since sliced bread
[13:42:28] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: $(this).toggleClass('yourclass')
[13:42:28] <airstrike> https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[13:42:50] <eddiemonge> airstrike: thats what you were using or you are going to be using?
[13:42:58] <itanex> eddiemonge thanks for your help... that page wasn't really helpful, in the end i had to create an instance of an erroring ajax just to get the object...
[13:42:59] <airstrike> that's what i'm going to be using now
[13:43:03] <CannedCo_> right but i want the ".post_body_text" class within this
[13:43:10] <airstrike> and on first tests, it's apparently fixing my problem
[13:43:15] <PlzHelp> Thanks Eddie! If I select no and hit submit I still have the same issue in the sense that I do not get the error msg.
[13:43:40] <eddiemonge> airstrike: thats what already seems to be happening, your ajax calls are affecting the history state and thats why back and reload show the data and not the page. when you do the ajax call, does your url change?
[13:44:03] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: you lost me
[13:44:06] <CannedCo_> ahh, you can change the context with a  second parameter
[13:44:15] <CannedCo_> cool
[13:44:22] <airstrike> @eddiemonge no, the url does not change
[13:45:45] <eddiemonge> and is there anything like pushState in your code? if not, then back and reload should not show the data
[13:46:42] <defendguin> gd this should work
[13:47:07] <CannedCo_> is using fadeout better than adding a hidden class?
[13:47:23] <airstrike> there is no pushState in the code, @eddiemonge
[13:47:37] <airstrike> but a simple ctrl+U after the $.ajax call will show the json data instead of the .html code
[13:47:59] <DualDetroit> CannedCo_: Maybe.
[13:50:53] <CannedCo_> can you not use add class with animate
[13:50:54] <CannedCo_> ?
[13:51:04] <CannedCo_> i want to animate and then call add class within it
[13:51:36] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: different sscenarios
[13:51:58] <CannedCo_> how so?
[13:52:04] <CannedCo_> i would like to add a class via animation
[13:52:11] <eddiemonge> airstrike: example code again or can you show a full page without the confid data
[13:52:16] <CannedCo_> am i not thinking of it the right way?
[13:52:23] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: you can do that
[13:52:44] <eddiemonge> i mean you can add the class in the animation callback
[13:53:34] <Thasmo> Anyone here who can help me with -moz-clip-path?
[13:54:55] <albertosh> anyone here using jquery mobile scrollview?
[13:57:12] <CannedCo_> eddiemonge but i'm trying to animate visibility
[13:57:17] <CannedCo_> and it isn't working at all
[13:58:45] <CannedCo_> $(".post_body_text", this).animate({visibility:"visible"}, 500)
[13:59:55] <eddiemonge> Thasmo: is it a jquery question or a css one?
[14:00:16] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: you mean opacity?
[14:00:19] <Thasmo> eddiemonge, CSS actually - probably JS too. :D
[14:00:43] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: that should be a fadeIn
[14:01:50] <CannedCo_> i see
[14:01:52] <CannedCo_> thanks
[14:02:12] <m4xx> i'm making two async .ajax() calls to my server, the first one takes a really long time to complete. the second one doesn't, yet the second request doesn't return until the first one completes. Is behavior due to my browser or server?
[14:02:58] <CannedCo_> eddiemonger thats not what i want
[14:03:13] <CannedCo_> eddiemonge it removes the object from the flow
[14:03:26] <CannedCo_> eddiemonge i want it to stay but just have zero visibility
[14:03:41] <thun> If I load  var whatever = $("#blah").html();    how can I make jquery calls on the var whatever?
[14:03:46] <thun> $(whatever)?
[14:03:56] <thun> becuase $(whatever).html() does not work
[14:05:38] <PlzHelp> eddiemonge - In the example update you posted can you think of a way to show the error message if they select no and click submit?  http://jsfiddle.net/ThcS8/22/
[14:08:54] <eddiemonge> CannedCo_: then animate the opacity
[14:09:04] <CannedCo_> yeah i needed fadeTo
[14:09:48] <eddiemonge> thun: what are you trying to do? .html() returns a string representation of whatever is in #blah
[14:12:01] <Ghoti42> ben_alman: you around? quick question if you are.

[14:18:59] <mbtez> burning in the undertow of god
[14:19:07] <klafka> in jquery is there a way to see how long it has been since a handler has been fired
[14:19:30] <klafka> or to put it another way, if i am checking for clicks on a checkbox, is there a way to see how long it's been since the last checkbox was clicked on
[14:19:45] <eddiemonge> mbtez: huh?
[14:19:51] <khmer> klafka: you could bind an event to all checkboxes that updates a variable with a timestamp in it!
[14:19:58] <mydoghasworms> Does tmpl() (official plugin) also allow a callback function to be passed?
[14:20:11] <klafka> oh khmer sweet
[14:20:14] <klafka> good idea
[14:20:51] <khmer> klafka: something like $(function(){ var ts = new Date(); $(':checkbox').change(function() { alert( new Date() - ts) })});
[14:21:53] <PlzHelp> Thanks eddiemonge - See your PM
[14:24:21] <Snugug> I'm looking to poll to see if an element is visible or not and change something whenever it changes from visible to invisible, how can I do that?
[14:24:28] <Snugug> It's a flyout menu using nice menus
[14:25:08] <eddiemonge> Snugug: you can check visibility with .is(':visible')
[14:25:30] <eddiemonge> but listening for when it changes is harder than just putting that function in when it changes
[14:25:40] <Snugug> eddiemonge: How can I do that then?
[14:25:48] <robacarp> is there a way to stick a wildcard inside a class selector? eg. '.foo6*_bar' to match '.foo65_bar' etc
[14:25:52] <DualDetroit> Snugug: Sounds horrible
[14:26:01] <eddiemonge> Snugug: what are you trying to do?
[14:26:03] <Snugug> DualDetroit: Agreed, but have an annoying client
[14:26:09] <eddiemonge> ?selectors
[14:26:10] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[14:26:23] <DualDetroit> Snugug: I hope your users stab your client with pitchforks then.
[14:26:27] <Snugug> They want border radius on parent drop down menu and flyout menu to change depending on whether or not the flyout menu is visible
[14:27:01] <eddiemonge> robacarp: why do you want to do that? thats not good. use classes or some other targeting
[14:27:45] <robacarp> eddiemonge: thanks, a simple 'no' would have sufficed.
[14:28:24] <kamaji> Is there an easy way to use a selector to move children elements to the same level as their parent?
[14:31:48] <eddiemonge> kamaji: var parent = $(parent); parent.find(children).appendTo( parent.parent() )
[14:31:58] <eddiemonge> or
[14:32:23] <eddiemonge> kamaji: var parent = $(parent); parent.find(children).insertAfter( parent )
[14:32:58] <context> ok im starting to get pissed.
[14:33:41] <context> i have a form (wahoo), and a reset button (amazing i know.) i have a click event handler to clear all input values, BUT if they are display:none it doesn't reset them
[14:33:45] <context> but i need them to be
[14:33:53] <context> it works in console, not in js included in page
[14:33:59] <sphinxxx> what's smoother to animate, margins or absolute position?
[14:34:04] <crash21> hello, i have a problem. i use symfony and jquery load function for ajax. when i load the page first time and delete a record the records deletes and the page returns with on record less but if i press again delete jquery dont work at all like dont having the click event... any ideas?
[14:34:41] <pvgrif> i have a scrollable div, when i do .height() i get the height that is visible, how do i get the real height, including the hidden part?
[14:34:53] <moo-_-> was there jquery API/plug-in to smoothly scroll to the element position on the page?
[14:34:54] <context> BUT it does clear type="hidden"
[14:35:09] <context> so... HOW do i clear form fields that are 'display:none;'
[14:35:26] <sphinxxx> context, try them visibility:hidden;
[14:35:29] <sphinxxx> does it clear them then
[14:35:46] <context> sphinxxx: im not setting the css, jquery-ui autocomplete combobox is
[14:35:49] <sphinxxx> it would help if you made a jsfiddle for it
[14:36:29] <kamaji> eddiemonge: Would I do that per element?
[14:37:42] <context> $('form[id$=_search] :input:not(:submit, :reset)').val('');
[14:37:54] <context> that line WORKS in console, but not when included in page.
[14:37:59] <sherl0ck1> alright, why are there so many template apps, what is a popular robust template system that works with jquery? - i found  all these -http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/37898666/Template
[14:38:09] <pvgrif> nvm i got it DOM property scrollHeight
[14:38:19] <context> why does crap work in console and not normally? :/
[14:38:49] <eddiemonge> kamaji: if you want. or group them in the find
[14:39:19] <eddiemonge> context: $('input').filter(':hidden').val('')
[14:40:12] <kamaji> eddiemonge: sorry, what do you mean by "group them in the find"?
[14:40:46] <eddiemonge> .find( 'element1, element2, element3')
[14:42:03] <context> eddiemonge: will try that again
[14:42:31] <catcher> What's the best way to debug my jquery when I'm getting no warnings/errors? Trying to get jQuery tools /tooltip going - everything is included, just no results.
[14:43:37] <eddiemonge> ?ftj @ catcher
[14:43:38] <bot-t> catcher, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:44:39] <catcher> reading, ty
[14:46:14] <context> still not working
[14:46:48] <eddiemonge> jsfiddle it
[14:46:56] <context> ill try
[14:52:12] <CannedCo_> guys, is there a way to not queue up effects during animation, so like if you have mouseenter/leave it doesn't do it 50 times if you move your mouse in and out but once
[14:52:24] <CannedCo_> i don't know if there is a term for that but i know there is a way to prevent it
[14:53:39] <context> kk first time using jsfiddle
[14:53:40] <ProLoser|Work> in spine/backbone, when is render() called? is it called implicitly upon init? or do i have to call it explicitly?
[14:53:46] <context> cant get it to work with basic example but: http://jsfiddle.net/w99uv/
[14:53:49] <context> something like that
[14:53:58] <CannedCo_> like prevent queuing of animations
[14:54:29] <context> maybe one of you can help me learndedid jsfiddle :/
[14:55:56] <context> ok its working there :/
[14:56:01] <context> but it doesnt work on my app :/
[14:56:04] <context> http://jsfiddle.net/w99uv/1/
[14:56:12] <jrockjiggz> this is why jsfiddle is win
[14:57:20] <context> jrockjiggz: it proves that jquery-ui is a piece of garbage ?
[14:57:41] <context> jrockjiggz: that still does NOT explain why crap works in the console and not when included in the page
[14:58:23] <jrockjiggz> everything happens for a reason.. u have a bug
[14:58:35] <context> sorry, it works when ran directly in console, not when its on an event handler
[14:58:47] <ajpiano> some bugs can be solved by anger alone!!!
[14:59:28] <jrockjiggz> i blame jquery...
[14:59:47] <context> kk. whats the difference between console and an event handler? when i console.dir() the form.find() resilts, the hidden fields ARE in there
[14:59:52] <context> but the values are not getting reset
[15:00:45] <context> ok. maybe not
[15:00:56] <context> /something/ else is resetting that value after i reset it
[15:01:27] <context> its blank at the end of my event handler, but after that its set again
[15:01:52] <ajpiano> context: maybe you have to prevent the default reset behaviour?
[15:02:21] <velts> does anyone have and idea how i could do something like a transform: scale(2) in IE7?
[15:02:52] <context> ahh
[15:03:17] <jrockjiggz> velts: zoom?
[15:03:49] <context> :/ there we go
[15:04:04] <ajpiano> context: so basically you're right, jquery ui sucks and is crap because of that
[15:04:05] <context> ajpiano: so... i unset the value, then it goes back as if it never happened ?
[15:04:06] <ajpiano> :x
[15:04:30] <context> ajpiano: well if this made sense at all i wouldn't be so pissed
[15:04:41] <ajpiano> context: if i were you i would just do a normal input type="button"
[15:04:43] <context> and yes jquery-ui still sucks, but not because of this. ;)
[15:04:46] <ajpiano> if i wanted some special type of handling
[15:04:56] <ajpiano> that wasn't inline with the normal form reset
[15:05:34] <context> and everything else stayed blank, only the hidden fields went back as if they were never touched
[15:05:42] <context> twilight zone anyone ?
[15:06:57] <klafka> how can i set a function to run once say an array foo has a length greater than 0 ? I'm not sure if this is a jquery question or javascript
[15:07:41] <jrockjiggz> if( array > 0){ function(); } ?
[15:08:49] <klafka> the array is changing dynamically, for instance, i have checkboxes, everytime a checkbox is checked the array increase in length
[15:09:07] <klafka> so it's an event driven array
[15:09:49] <ajpiano> you need some kind of "observable" array
[15:09:58] <jrockjiggz> I just add a validate in the submit event that checkes how many checkboxes and returns if valid
[15:10:05] <ajpiano> like the array provided by knockout JS, or Backbone's Collections
[15:10:16] <ajpiano> because normal arrays don't have events
[15:10:42] <ajpiano> http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observableArrays.html
[15:11:41] <donburks> jQueryUI question: Let's say I had an accordion. Each h3 represented a category. Within that category, I have subcategories. Ideally, I would like to accordion those subcategories as well. Is it possible/advisable to nest accordions?
[15:11:51] <donburks> subcategories are designated by h4's
[15:12:15] <ajpiano> it's certainly possible,
[15:12:21] <ajpiano> whether it's advisable is up to you :)
[15:12:37] <donburks> Let's pretend, for the moment, that I have the patience of a saint. Is it advisable now?
[15:13:58] <ajpiano> advisable meaning like "is it hard" or "will it feel like crap in your application because that's a lot of polka"
[15:14:25] <donburks> The latter.
[15:14:53] <jrockjiggz> i never liked accordians.. thats just me
[15:15:17] <ajpiano> donburks: i'd recommend feeling that out
[15:15:23] <ajpiano> i'd *probably* avoid it myself
[15:15:52] <donburks> k. Ty. *rolls up sleeves, sighs*
[15:36:24] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:36:36] <ProLoser|Work> in spine/backbone, how do i call a parent method/super method?
[15:37:19] <ajpiano> you just call it off the prototype :/
[15:37:53] <ajpiano> Backbone.Collection.prototype.initialize.call( this, options );
[15:39:56] <ProLoser|Work> uh… huh?
[15:40:02] <ProLoser|Work> sorry, if i make a view
[15:40:21] <ProLoser|Work> like i did View.create() and then i did a new view from my 'app' view
[15:40:25] <ProLoser|Work> but i want to call app methods
[15:40:42] <ajpiano> huh
[15:40:50] <ajpiano> i don't use spine
[15:40:56] <ajpiano> you have to stop talking about them like they're the same
[15:40:56] <ProLoser|Work> i think it's the same
[15:41:02] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[15:41:07] <ajpiano> it's not View.create() in Backbone...
[15:41:15] <ProLoser|Work> so what is it in backbone?
[15:41:33] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work - I'm blogging soon about making a backbone like framework fast and easy with jquery
[15:41:35] <ajpiano> new View({})
[15:41:36] <Dave_Stein> no underscore required etc
[15:41:45] <ProLoser|Work> Dave_Stein: it's called spine
[15:41:55] <Dave_Stein> i didnt like spine as much
[15:41:59] <Dave_Stein> and still io nly took 4 functions from backbone or so
[15:42:06] <ProLoser|Work> meh
[15:42:10] <Dave_Stein> brb watching a video imsky sent me
[15:42:10] <ProLoser|Work> i wrote my own version of spine
[15:42:21] <Dave_Stein> bet you mine is better :D
[15:42:22] <ProLoser|Work> or more specifically, i only use the spine controller and module class
[15:42:31] <ProLoser|Work> feel free to send it my way if it works
[15:42:34] <Dave_Stein> yeah i took what i need so no extra code lying around
[15:42:37] <ProLoser|Work> problem for me is my whole app isn't on 1 page
[15:42:41] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: dropping by tomorrow right?
[15:43:04] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: im free like 3-5 but i usually aim for coffe around 4
[15:43:09] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: what if i do AppView = new View(); and then i do customView = new AppView();
[15:43:23] <ajpiano> hmmm that's late, i have to leave for the airport at like 5 ://
[15:43:40] <ajpiano> might have to do next week instead?
[15:43:53] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: customView.someMethod(); ?
[15:43:54] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i can do 230 or next week ha
[15:44:08] <Dave_Stein> that looks right
[15:44:31] <ajpiano> lets do next week, i need to get into my pre-air-travel relaxaation state
[15:44:56] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[15:44:59] <Dave_Stein> haha ok
[15:45:52] <Dave_Stein> i know im stresing you with my crushing words skills still
[15:46:13] <Dave_Stein> damn you crockford "$ should be reserved for machines"
[15:46:24] <Dave_Stein> when do i have machines making my code??
[15:46:51] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: uch don't get me started
[15:47:01] <ajpiano> OTOH, i did hit SQUEALERS in a game of scrab today for 101
[15:47:05] <ajpiano> so nothing can bring me down
[15:47:11] <Dave_Stein> haha
[15:47:39] <ajpiano> http://ajpiano.com/cap/641ca7.png
[15:47:45] <coldhead> in that way you are unlike the world trade center
[15:47:46] <ajpiano> -S
[15:48:08] <Dave_Stein> ah thats one of your geek scrabble sites
[15:48:17] <Dave_Stein> i already play on phone and scrabble on facebook
[15:48:17] <Dave_Stein> so
[15:48:19] <Dave_Stein> im at my limit
[15:48:29] <ajpiano> you're missing out, i'll show you
[15:49:37] <ajpiano> one of these days :D
[15:51:02] <Dave_Stein> yeah yeah
[15:51:11] <Dave_Stein> meanwhile i gotta say, working on code that deals with charging people blows
[15:51:13] <Dave_Stein> so stressful
[15:51:14] <Dave_Stein> ughh
[15:51:37] * muzone is now playing: http://www.home.no/dwaynie/mmmmm.mp3
[15:52:37] <muzone> i mean http://soundcloud.com/mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm/mmmmm
[15:53:12] <z1000> for :even and :odd .. what is the best way to do lets say every 4th item ?
[15:53:23] <z1000> not The 4th but every 4th
[15:55:14] <Dave_Stein> ?nth-child-selector @z1000
[15:55:15] <bot-t> z1000, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[15:57:02] <z1000> Dave_Stein, so I have to define every 4th
[15:57:16] <z1000> nth-child(4,8,12,16) .. can it be done like that?
[15:57:46] <Dave_Stein> i thought 4 works fine
[15:57:54] <z1000> ok ill have to try it
[15:58:02] <Dave_Stein> im checking now
[15:58:04] <Dave_Stein> curious
[15:58:11] <z1000> ok cool ty let me know
[15:58:42] <ries> hey guys, I am doing this : var items=jQuery(dat).find('item'); in Safari and firefox it shows I am having 13 items, but in IE I am getting 0
[15:58:54] <ries> what could cause IE not be able to fetch the items?
[15:59:13] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/2NMeJ/
[15:59:20] <Dave_Stein> @z1000 its 4n]
[15:59:42] <imsky> IT IS WHAT IT IS
[15:59:48] <nathanw> hey everyone!!!!!
[15:59:51] <z1000> thanks Dave_Stein
[15:59:52] <Dave_Stein> imsky: im gonna $ all night long
[16:00:01] <Dave_Stein> ries: uhhh is item an HTML tag??
[16:00:13] <imsky> Dave_Stein: you're making crockford cry
[16:00:20] <ries> Dave_Stein: it's a tag of a xml
[16:00:27] <imsky> also $thing smacks of "i don't want to leave php behind"
[16:00:51] <Dave_Stein> imsky: when machines are writing code, and we're in the matrix, i'll follow that convention
[16:00:57] <imsky> machines are writing code
[16:00:58] <Dave_Stein> imsky: but jquery itsself doesn't follow it even
[16:01:07] <imsky> and the crock talked about that
[16:01:11] <Dave_Stein> imsky: you mean the java <-> js stuffs?
[16:01:13] <imsky> that's why there's a fallback to jQuery() btw
[16:01:15] <Dave_Stein> yeah he wasnt too happy
[16:01:23] <imsky> no i mean everything from C to basic code generators
[16:01:47] <Dave_Stein> ries: im not sure you can use jquery on XML im not sure tho
[16:02:04] <Dave_Stein> my $poop var should never interfere with a machine var, unless the machine is using global vars
[16:02:08] <Dave_Stein> and then i would have to kill that machine
[16:02:19] <Dave_Stein> my global vars dont start with $
[16:02:24] <Dave_Stein> so there shouldn't be a conflict
[16:02:31] <imsky> so why would you use $thing then
[16:02:35] <imsky> when thing suffices
[16:02:52] <ries> Dave_Stein: Will check a couple of things
[16:02:57] <Dave_Stein> my globals are Singletons like App or App.Checkout App.Product
[16:03:04] <Dave_Stein> $thing = $('#thing')
[16:03:08] <imsky> :(
[16:03:08] <Dave_Stein> inside a function
[16:03:10] <Dave_Stein> safe from machine
[16:03:13] <imsky> that makes no sense
[16:03:22] <imsky> what's the rationale for doing that
[16:03:25] <Dave_Stein> how often are people confused between a DOM var and a jquery object?
[16:03:30] <imsky> not often
[16:03:39] <Dave_Stein> ehhh if i have a function with 5 vars
[16:03:45] <Dave_Stein> and 2 are DOM and 3 are jquery
[16:03:49] <Dave_Stein> no way to know what you can do right on the spot
[16:04:05] <imsky> wut
[16:04:15] <Dave_Stein> well clearly a dom node and jquery object have different properties
[16:04:24] <Dave_Stein> and if my var is App.Checkout.$submit_button
[16:04:24] <imsky> is this like javascript pandemonium
[16:04:31] <imsky> HERES A FUNCTION, FIGURE IT OUT SOLDIER
[16:04:42] <Dave_Stein> haha
[16:05:01] <imsky> whenever i see $thing, i think "someone isn't getting this"
[16:05:33] <Dave_Stein> its just nice to instantly know if app.thing is a dom node or jquery object without having to scroll away to the definition
[16:05:43] <Dave_Stein> which can easily be outside that function, if the var is a member
[16:06:20] <nick21> hello
[16:06:24] <Dave_Stein> or can be in a diff file if youre extending using mixins
[16:06:54] <Dave_Stein> like App.Item = new View; App.Item.List = App.Item.extend...
[16:07:04] <imsky> i'm gonna just go with ben alman here
[16:07:07] <nick21> when you call load function and the new content have a button with load function doesn't work... know why?
[16:07:07] <Dave_Stein> and then in App.Item.List, if it has $name id know that name is linking to a jquery obj
[16:07:11] <imsky> var elem = $(this);    elem.html(elem.html() + "!!!");
[16:07:24] <imsky> if ben alman doesn't write $elem, and crockford says don't do it
[16:07:31] <imsky> then you're just being a fancypants
[16:07:46] <Dave_Stein> ?jsfiddle @ nick21
[16:07:46] <bot-t> nick21, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[16:08:06] <Dave_Stein> whoever said i didn't like being a fancy pants?
[16:08:14] <imsky> now that i think about it
[16:08:18] <imsky> disregarding convention
[16:08:27] <imsky> you have to type Shift+4 for every variable like that
[16:08:39] <Dave_Stein> oh noes the extra key stroke haha
[16:08:42] <imsky> 2
[16:08:53] <Dave_Stein> eh both fingers hit same time
[16:08:59] <imsky> if you have so much code that you need to know what's a jq object or not, you need to refactor
[16:09:13] <imsky> otherwise i can very easily see $page, $sidebar, $footer, $inner-footer
[16:09:16] <Dave_Stein> but in my mixin example, even one variable would be unclear from the other obj
[16:10:05] <Dave_Stein> and that convention definitely helps noobs catch on faster
[16:10:16] <imsky> i dunno bro, the fact that you tweeted me early in the morning about this means you were thinking about it all night long
[16:10:20] <imsky> clearly you want to be right here
[16:10:21] <klafka> can you use knockout observable arrays in jquery funcitons that expect an array?
[16:10:26] <imsky> so enjoy $footer for all eternity
[16:11:07] <Dave_Stein> oh i will :)
[16:11:15] <imsky> are you still at work
[16:11:22] <Dave_Stein> until machines are writing my code then i will change
[16:11:27] <imsky> they ARE lol
[16:11:28] <Dave_Stein> im done but waiting for some guys
[16:11:35] <Dave_Stein> they arent writing my specific code
[16:11:49] <Dave_Stein> theres a new coworking space and they are streaming behance work on the walls
[16:11:49] <imsky> what do you think the day will be like when machines will write your code
[16:11:52] <Dave_Stein> so theres a party tonight
[16:12:11] <Dave_Stein> "ehhh imsky was right but i probably had to rewrite shit by this piont anyway"
[16:12:38] <imsky> all those Shift+4s and recommendations by crockford
[16:12:39] <imsky> wasted
[16:13:44] <Dave_Stein> you're definitely right when the day comes, but i'll at least be right to me for a few more years
[16:16:07] <Dave_Stein> anyway im gonna go veg while i wait for these guys
[16:16:17] <imsky> you gotta learn what machine generated code is mang
[16:16:20] <Dave_Stein> and i wasnt thinking about it all night - it slipped my mind for a while until i was reminded this monring by coding with $
[16:16:24] <imsky> i think you're envisioning robots and HAL
[16:16:38] <Dave_Stein> well ya know HAL really didn't like Dave
[16:16:43] <Dave_Stein> i'll go read up some more then
[16:16:44] <imsky> you see what i mean
[16:16:47] <imsky> he needs those $$$$
[16:17:02] <Dave_Stein> keep linking and ill keep reading ha
[16:17:03] <Dave_Stein> ttyl
[16:17:25] <imsky> mmmlater
[16:17:35] <imsky> abjorn: the day has come
[16:26:16] <abjorn> imsky: what day
[16:27:54] <imsky> the day to rue
[16:31:51] <abjorn> why should I rue this day
[16:32:38] <coldhead> it's ruination day
[16:32:41] <coldhead> time's the revelator
[16:32:43] <abjorn> Because no one made a fuss over Dennis Ritchie dying even though he's much more of a genius than fucking Steve Jobs ever was and made much more of an impact in the world? Cause that's why I rue this day.
[16:32:54] <abjorn> I rue this day hard.
[16:33:11] <abjorn> brb gonna get food while ruing thing day
[16:33:27] <rgr> dennis ritchie was a competent compiler writer not much more. C was great.
[16:34:23] <rgr> why twits like you want to compare him to jobs is anyones guess. jobs was in the public limielight and was an innovator and created the wolds richest company. if you dont think thats an achievement then I shudder to think how brilliant you must personally be.
[16:34:49] <ries> Any reason why this wouldn't work in firefox? var firstOptionValue = $("#division option:first")[0].innerText;
[16:35:20] <rgr> why the [0]? with first you dont need it.
[16:35:29] <coldhead> IN ANY CASE, they're both dead and we're still here
[16:35:36] <coldhead> let's move on
[16:35:38] <tjholowaychuk> do jquery templates accept dom nodes as values?
[16:35:43] <ProLoser|Work> does $().load() return a deferred object or promise object?
[16:35:50] <ries> rgr: Hmm I thought it returned a list still, let me check
[16:35:55] <ProLoser|Work> aka: can i do $.when($().load)) ????
[16:36:23] <ries> rgr: I have to use [0]
[16:36:32] <rgr> Just a guess on my part but I use e.g parents(".class:first").blah() a lot
[16:38:53] <imsky> abjorn: i commemorated richie's passing
[16:39:04] <imsky> we owe literally everything to him, in this industry
[16:39:11] <imsky> ritchie* dammit
[16:39:33] <coldhead> i mostly liked that he and kernie had each other
[16:39:38] <coldhead> they didn't have to be alone
[16:39:41] <imsky> ?js (function(a,b){return(1e15+a+"").slice(-b)})(64,64)
[16:39:42] <bot-t> imsky: "1000000000000064"
[16:39:45] <coldhead> and they could share a love the world would never understand
[16:39:54] <coldhead> brokeback mountain style
[16:39:59] <coldhead> but now kernie is alone
[16:40:00] <imsky> bet you cried when jobs died coldhead
[16:40:16] <coldhead> i have no apple products
[16:40:23] <coldhead> so it was hard for me, yes
[16:40:25] <imsky> oh so you just like to make fun of people in death
[16:40:31] <imsky> lol niiiice bro
[16:40:40] <coldhead> i make fun of everything all the time
[16:40:46] <coldhead> why is death so fancy and special?
[16:40:49] <imsky> i dunno, dead people are hands off
[16:40:54] <coldhead> not for me
[16:41:02] <coldhead> when i die, please have your way with me
[16:41:35] <imsky> hmmmmmmmm
[16:42:06] <coldhead> you'll see i'm not actually mocking ritchie
[16:42:13] <imsky> http://qdb.us/307171 coldhead
[16:42:14] <imsky> for u bb
[16:42:48] <coldhead> thanks imsky
[16:42:57] <coldhead> please ensure my lawyer sees that when i am gone
[16:43:02] <imsky> i shall
[16:43:02] <dhampton_> underwhat circumstances does $.ajax convert a type:'POST' to a type'GET'?
[16:43:05] <coldhead> he will supply your vaseline
[16:43:11] <dhampton_> Im seeing it convert on me and don't knjow why
[16:43:53] <coldhead> dhampton_: the only reason i can think of is if you're not correctly specifying the type
[16:43:58] <coldhead> so it doesn't know you want POST
[16:44:03] <coldhead> and it's defaulting to GET
[16:44:08] <coldhead> otherwise it should do as you ask
[16:44:09] <dhampton_> $.post('http://dev101.wl.vcslide.net/slide/rpc.html', {a:1}, undefined,'jsonp');
[16:44:19] <dhampton_> thats what im thinking
[16:44:26] <coldhead> oh jsonp, bro
[16:44:32] <coldhead> that's a special case
[16:44:36] <eddiemonge> i like the undefined in there too
[16:44:37] <dhampton_> ah ha
[16:44:44] <coldhead> you can't do post to jsonp
[16:44:45] <dhampton_> well, the undefined works
[16:44:52] <dhampton_> is that a new change?
[16:44:55] <dhampton_> or always been
[16:44:56] <dhampton_> ?
[16:45:01] <nathanw> hey does this work? $(this).closest("li").find("input.addedQty").val($(this).closest("li").find("input.qty").val());    <-- should copy the closest .qty value to .addedQty
[16:45:15] <coldhead> dhampton_: jsonp is a hack
[16:45:23] <coldhead> it's relies on GET
[16:45:36] <coldhead> it literally inserts a script tag
[16:45:43] <coldhead> and you can only use GET there
[16:45:44] <dhampton_> coldhead:  yes, a hack we all use....  ok.  I can convert back to a get and cross my fingers
[16:45:45] <coldhead> no post
[16:45:59] <coldhead> i meant hack in a positive sense
[16:46:01] <dhampton_> thanks a lot coldhead
[16:46:30] <dhampton_> now i know why it broke - and why it worked before.
[16:46:42] <dhampton_> the test code WAS on the same server
[16:46:53] <dhampton_> so the jsonp was "sortof" disregarded
[16:46:56] <dhampton_> now its a different server
[16:46:59] <dhampton_> nice
[16:47:10] <dhampton_> thanks for the quick fix
[16:47:42] <coldhead> thanks for sticking around you big jerk
[16:48:37] <eddiemonge> coldhead: i am not a jerk!
[16:48:41] <eddiemonge> ok maybe i am
[16:48:54] <coldhead> i wasn't talking to you!

[16:51:39] <nathanw> can someone help me ? http://jsfiddle.net/YCUza/
[16:51:46] <nathanw> need to add a simple function
[16:51:54] <coldhead> you're a very polite young man, nathanw
[16:52:04] <nathanw> :)
[16:52:46] <coldhead> what do you need to add nathanw?
[16:52:49] <nathanw> need to copy the value of one input to another
[16:53:07] <rgr> The fanbois are strong today. Amazing what wonder powers people are imbued with when they learn what *d++=*s++ means ;)
[16:53:12] <nathanw> if you look at my code, we're already finding the closest li object to the clicked element
[16:53:50] <nathanw> so i'm not sure where to put this new arguement so it works inside the closest one
[16:54:13] <coldhead> C is hardly a fanboi cult
[16:54:14] <muzone> http://soundcloud.com/mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm/mmmmm
[16:54:24] <nathanw> something like this should work  $("input#shipping-phone").val($("input#phone").val());
[16:54:50] <rgr> no Ive programmed it for 20 years. I didnt say C was, I said certain elements that recently learnt it are. C is a great language.
[16:55:06] <falieson> my keydown script is breakign accordion, can someone take a look?

[16:55:16] <troubleman> snover: this doesnt prove you could kick him in real life though :)
[16:55:28] <falieson> the esc is breaking, the ctrl+f works fine
[16:55:29] <troubleman> snover: only proves you dislike the sorta effect his music has on your girls
[16:55:31] <troubleman> whoops
[16:55:32] <snover> troubleman: who is trying to prove anything? what the fuck does that even mean?
[16:55:34] <troubleman> you aint got no girls
[16:55:36] <rgr> surely geting return to submit a form inside a jquery-ui dialog shouldnt be so heavy..
[16:55:37] <coldhead> that looks good to me, nathanw
[16:55:40] <ries> rgr I had to use .text() instead of [0].innerText(); <= works on safary
[16:55:44] <snover> coldhead can explain to you why I have no girls troubleman
[16:55:49] <snover> it will blow your mind.
[16:55:55] <coldhead> if that doesn't work can you update your code with that and show me where it doesn't work, nathanw
[16:56:38] <coldhead> troubleman: snover is in a wheelchair, and no woman can abide his presence
[16:56:45] <nathanw> coldhead: i tried this but it's not working
[16:56:55] <nathanw>  $(this).closest("li").find("input.qtyAdded").val($(this).closest("li").find("input.qty").val()); 	
[16:57:14] <coldhead> nathanw: don't do it in one like like that, it's hard to read
[16:57:16] <troubleman> coldhead: thats like saying humans cant do nothing
[16:57:18] <eddiemonge> nathanw: that is highly inefficient. cache your jq objects
[16:57:27] <nathanw> pls explain
[16:57:36] <nathanw> http://jsfiddle.net/YCUza/.
[16:57:57] <troubleman> a man in a wheelchair can just as easily produce say a piece of music that will as easily blow the mind off hot chicks worldwide

[16:58:09] <troubleman> as a man whos not in a wheelchair

[17:01:42] <falieson> can someone please help me with this .keydown accordion issue?
[17:01:50] <falieson> I'm not sure why one script works fine and the other is just busted
[17:02:05] <rgr> same as lamers that feel the need to declare they are "stoned" to all and sundry on irc.
[17:02:07] <eddiemonge> nathanw: slightly optimized http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/YCUza/2/
[17:03:20] <eddiemonge> falieson: code is helpful
[17:03:36] <ajpiano> falieson: you shouldn't activate an accordion like this
[17:03:52] <ajpiano> the jquery ui accordion is designed that only one pane is open at a time
[17:04:00] <coldhead> rgr: what's your policy on people declaring their desire but inability to get stoned?
[17:04:06] <nathanw> eddie: that breaks some functionality
[17:04:10] <ajpiano> forcing them open with slideDown isn't going to lead to great happiness
[17:04:13] <nathanw> coldhead: i'm getting no value logged
[17:04:31] <catcher> I inherited an application that uses /#/ in the URL (not an anchor). My jquery function works right when I manually take the /#/ out of the URL, but stops working when it's there. Any ideas?
[17:04:35] <rgr> to discuss  halibut and jehovah. That gets you stoned.
[17:04:37] <eddiemonge> nathanw: i didnt test it, i was just showing you a slightly better way to code, in terms of readability and performance
[17:05:44] <rgr> one mans readability is another mans wasted screen real estate.
[17:05:53] <coldhead> nathanw: my code was just a starting point, you have to make it work
[17:06:01] <nathanw> ok
[17:06:38] <josh99> i print a jquery object and see: 'file://blablbabla.index.html'  how to see more info about this object?
[17:09:11] <nathanw> coldhead: is value the right thing to be getting? needs to get whatever the user has put in
[17:09:22] <eddiemonge> josh99:  what do you mean by "print"?
[17:09:40] <falieson> ajpiano: not true, ctrl+f works just fine, at least in chrome. www.florianmettetal.com
[17:09:46] <falieson> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/U5Tsh/
[17:10:03] <falieson> ajpiano: its the esc that's breaking everythign right
[17:11:05] <rgr> C-f is a poor choice of key
[17:11:24] <eddiemonge> falieson: those second two blocks should be in the doc ready as well
[17:11:25] <falieson> rgr: the whole point is so that it works with a recruiter just ctrl+fing through the resume
[17:11:47] <rgr> C-f is a browser standard pretty much for find. overwriting it wontmake you popular
[17:12:02] <falieson> rgr: i'm not overwriting it, i'm fascilitating my accordions to work well with it
[17:12:08] <rgr> yes you are
[17:12:14] <falieson> take a look
[17:12:32] <falieson> eddiemonge: $resume-trd ist he entire accordion block, not a single part
[17:12:36] <falieson> *is the
[17:13:02] <rgr> oh you want C-f toopen them all up so standard find works or what?
[17:13:38] <falieson> rgr: yeah, I want them all to open on ctrl+f so that someone can search through all the accordions, otherwise the content is hidden
[17:13:40] <ajpiano> you should consider not introducing weird ui conventions into your resume
[17:13:47] <falieson> ctrl+f works fine, its the esc that's breaking everything
[17:13:50] <imsky> ajpiano++
[17:13:55] <ajpiano> it doesn't make people get too excited about you as a ui engineer :x
[17:14:03] <falieson> I'm not a ui engineer...
[17:14:03] <imsky> if you're overriding the browser search function, you're screwing up
[17:14:04] <falieson> lol
[17:14:09] <falieson> its not overriding
[17:14:13] <rgr> well it doesnt as youre still changing how C-f works. And an accordion, isnt only one open at a time?
[17:14:17] <eddiemonge> falieson: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/U5Tsh/1/
[17:14:17] <falieson> you press ctrl+f the finder still opens
[17:14:18] <PrgmrBill> I really like UX people resumes
[17:14:22] <PrgmrBill> they are always pretty/interesting
[17:15:01] <rgr> why not just have an "open all" button if you must. BUt frankly I think youd be better off presenting it in LaTeX ;)
[17:15:15] <coldhead> nathanw: val() will get you whatever a user has entered in an <input>
[17:15:21] <coldhead> i think it's what you want
[17:15:36] <coldhead> nathanw: if you can paste your HTML on jsfiddle we can get a working demo demo
[17:15:42] <falieson> eddiemonge: refresh, esc still breaks everything
[17:15:47] <coldhead> s/demo demo/demo going/
[17:15:51] <coldhead> and fix it forever
[17:16:13] <eddiemonge> falieson: refresh what? i was just rewriting your existing code without making any functional changes
[17:16:32] <Spadeski> Whats up people
[17:16:34] <falieson> yeah, it didn't fix the problem
[17:16:43] <falieson> www.florianmettetal.com
[17:16:48] <eddiemonge> falieson: i dont really know what your actual problem is
[17:17:02] <imsky> oh man
[17:17:05] <falieson> after you press esc the accordions no longer work
[17:17:09] <nathanw> coldhead: ok stand by
[17:17:11] <eddiemonge> oh i see what the commotion is
[17:17:13] <imsky> facebook layout + random weird styling + default jquery ui styling
[17:17:18] <imsky> this is full of win :\
[17:17:21] <falieson> lol
[17:17:26] <falieson> i'm dealing with style after functinoa,ity
[17:17:31] <eddiemonge> you are effin with my search hot key whilst asking for a lawsuit from facebook
[17:17:37] <imsky> oh yeah
[17:17:40] <falieson> yup
[17:17:42] <imsky> didn't even think about IP
[17:17:45] <imsky> it's a .com ffs
[17:17:48] <ajpiano> falieson: you are breaking your contract with the accordion api by manipulating the panels directly with slideUp and slideDown
[17:18:10] <ajpiano> that is why i say the API doesn't support it, and why i'm not surprised that it breaks
[17:18:35] <DualDetroit> OH YEAH YEAH YEAH, YOU KNOW IT!!! DUAL DETROIT BE IN DA HO-WWWWWWWWW-USE, HOMEBOYZ!!!!!
[17:18:52] * DualDetroit dances with gold chains.
[17:18:52] <falieson> ajpiano: your logic doesn't make sense... because i'm not doign wtah they want me to do therefore it breaks?
[17:18:56] <falieson> lol

[17:19:13] <denysonique> ?
[17:19:39] <nathanw> coldhead: http://goo.gl/ZaXdL  <--- I'm trying to fix a bug.  when the user enters a value in the qty field.. the tax, etc is calculated at the bottom. but the problem is, I need the tax at the bottom to be only calculated if they add the item to the order.
[17:20:03] <eddiemonge> denysonique: like an accordian?
[17:20:14] <nathanw> coldhead: so I was thinking create a second input, and have onclick copy the value of the clicked qty to the dummy one, then calculate tax from that one
[17:20:16] <denysonique> eddiemonge:
[17:20:17] <denysonique> yes
[17:20:32] <eddiemonge> ?accordion @ denysonique
[17:20:33] <bot-t> denysonique, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[17:20:51] <Kamakazi> denysonique: Of if you don't want accordion, like want multiple areas expanded at once, I use slideToggle
[17:20:59] <ajpiano> falieson: when you use a component that has an API it's just good to not muck with its DOM internally in a way that forces it to do something it *does not support*
[17:21:04] <ajpiano> which is having multiple panels open at the same time
[17:21:27] <ajpiano> falieson: if you want an accordion that allows multiple panels open at the same time, try the wijmo accordion
[17:21:28] <ajpiano> http://wijmo.com/widgets/wijmo-open/accordion/
[17:21:31] <ajpiano> it's built on top of jquery ui
[17:21:35] <eddiemonge> nathanw: then only calculate after the add to order is clicked
[17:21:41] <denysonique> Kamakazi: cheers
[17:22:01] <falieson> ajpiano: thank you very much for the help, i appreciate someone actually providing constructive help!
[17:22:04] <falieson> rather than falmes...
[17:22:06] <falieson> *flames...
[17:22:09] <falieson> so thank you thank you
[17:22:18] * Kamakazi prepares to provide flames
[17:22:19] <Kamakazi> ;)
[17:22:25] <nathanw> eddie: the same script is calculating the individual equipment totals as well... i just need to try and separate it
[17:22:29] <denysonique> What I am going to do is: I will write some jQuery CoffeeScript, which listens for the data-expands='someClass' attribute
[17:22:32] <ajpiano> falieson: ok, best of luck
[17:22:32] <eddiemonge> falieson: my help wasnt constructive? showing a way to optimize your code isnt helpful? i feel hurt :(
[17:22:59] <falieson> eddiemonge: haha, I guess i'm not good enough at js to understand the improvement?
[17:23:05] <falieson> eddiemonge: but i do appreciate it and am jeeping it
[17:23:05] <falieson> :-)
[17:23:24] <eddiemonge> nathanw: sounds complicated. does it need to be?
[17:23:28] <ProLoser|Work> YOU CANT ALWAYS COMMIT WHAT YOU WANT
[17:23:33] <ProLoser|Work> YOU CANT ALWAYS COMMIT WHAT YOU WANT
[17:23:36] <ProLoser|Work> BUT IF YOU TRY SOMETIMES
[17:23:38] <ProLoser|Work> YOU MIGHT FIND
[17:23:42] <ProLoser|Work> YOU UPDATE WHAT YOU NEEEEEED
[17:23:55] <nathanw> eddie: each product has a rate , quantity and total field... on keyup rate x quantity is calc'd for that line
[17:24:21] <ajpiano> falieson: the reason why you're "violating the contract" is that like, a component like that tracks the state of where things are, both in memory and using classes on the elements
[17:24:22] <nathanw> eddie: problem is atm its calculating the tax of everything onkeyup of any qty field
[17:24:35] <nathanw> eddie: when it needs to be on button click
[17:24:43] <ajpiano> when you just slideUp the element, you're just basically slapping an inline style on there, closing it up, but not changing any of the things that the widget uses to determine the state
[17:24:54] <ajpiano> so that's why it breaks afterward
[17:24:57] <eddiemonge> nathanw: ok then why not switch it to button click then? im confused
[17:25:09] <ajpiano> so that's why you use APIs when things give them to you !
[17:25:16] <ajpiano> and now i'm going to take a shower, goodnight internet
[17:25:24] <falieson> ajpiano: thanks for the expl
[17:25:45] <ajpiano> :)

[17:26:50] <someguy5> and Sat Oct 22 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0400

[17:28:06] <eddiemonge> someguy5: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[17:28:50] <nathanw> eddie: just confused as to how to go about that
[17:29:38] <eddiemonge> nathanw: i dont understand why the tax is being calculated on keyup instead of click so im confused too
[17:31:15] <rgr> Someone got a clean solution for having return key submitting a form inside a jquery-ui dialog?
[17:31:23] <nathanw> eddie: because that's how it came with the plugin. originally it was only rate x qty , but grew from there
[17:32:37] <eddiemonge> nathanw: oh its a plugin. hack the plugin
[17:34:57] <DualDetroit> Can an entire web app be a jquery plugin for whitelabeling purposes?
[17:36:26] <imsky> yeah!
[17:36:26] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to call $.when() inside a $.when()
[17:37:10] <nathanw> eddie: ok i've got it to only calc tax on click
[17:37:28] <nathanw> eddie: but problem is i have a remove / edit order button... when removing / editing i need it to remove it from the calculations
[17:37:58] <eddiemonge> nathanw: fire the calculations on that click too
[17:38:13] <nathanw> I've done that but it calculates from the qty field,
[17:38:27] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/76czy/
[17:38:35] <nathanw> qty field still has a value
[17:38:41] <nathanw> only way is to reset that value
[17:38:46] <nathanw> only simply way anyways
[17:38:47] <ProLoser|Work> for some reason inside includes() when i call resource() on ready it exits the function
[17:39:28] <eddiemonge> nathanw: i think its time to start over and code it correctly from the beginning
[17:42:32] <DualDetroit> WTF is $.when? :<
[17:42:42] <coldhead> ?when
[17:42:43] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[17:43:30] <DualDetroit> That's very odd coldhead.
[17:43:33] <ProLoser|Work> DualDetroit: helps with async code
[17:44:00] <ProLoser|Work> van anyone take a look at my code?
[17:44:06] <DualDetroit> Maybe if I see an example I'll understand what it means by objects.
[17:44:28] <ProLoser|Work> for some reason, when i call jv.Factory.resource('includes', fn); it executes the fn before includes is resolved
[17:44:35] * DualDetroit clycks link.
[17:44:57] <nathanw> haha no
[17:48:58] <porjo> I have a page which reloads every 30secs. Jquery ensures that the server is available (via async GET) before issuing the window.reload. If the network connection drops, the page reload will be postponed. The problem I have is when the PC comes out of suspend this mechanism breaks, and the page is reloaded before the network is ready. How could I work around that?
[17:49:05] <nathanw> how do I clone something and change it's class ?
[17:52:39] <DualDetroit> porjo: You just made me want to smash my laptop against a concrete block repeatedly.
[17:52:44] <eddiemonge> nathanw: $(ele).clone().addClass().removeClass()
[17:53:17] <DualDetroit> porjo: You make me sick :<
[17:53:17] <nathanw> thanks eddie!!!
[17:54:44] <DualDetroit> porjo: You would be better off requesting the page via your ajax $.get() and then doing $(document).html(responsedata) if the HTTP status code was 200 OK
[17:54:46] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[17:54:52] <ProLoser|Work> can anyone take a look at my code?
[17:55:07] <DualDetroit> ProLoser|Work: GUTEN TAG MICH!!!!!!!!!
[17:57:53] <ProLoser|Work> huh?
[17:58:50] <porjo> DualDetroit: do you have a spare laptop? ;)  I'll try using the method you said. My hunch is that won't help, as I suspect the page reload is being triggered at a lower level than the javascript...we'll see :)
[18:01:40] <gnarf> DualDetroit: brave....
[18:02:12] <DualDetroit> porjo: Yeah, but at least you can control it
[18:02:16] <DualDetroit> gnarf: What's brave?
[18:02:32] <DualDetroit> porjo: At least, I think
[18:02:36] <gnarf> DualDetroit: you are....
[18:02:40] <DualDetroit> Why?
[18:04:23] * DualDetroit just likes being roughed up by ops.
[18:07:56] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to auto scale text so it scales down if wrapped and grows in font size until it fits perfectly? sometimes i have a container that is fixed width but the content can vary in length, and id like to scale the font so it fits snug, avoid wrapping
[18:08:38] <aniasis|karega> jQuery.tmpl doesn't work for me when I load the markup from an http request

[18:15:21] <CodeZombie> is anyone aware of a plugin, or maybe have an example of how to deal with placing markers over an image, and being able to keep those markers in thier assigned position through zoom.
[18:15:27] <CodeZombie> I'm having a hell of time with my own code
[18:15:57] <bencahill> hey guys, I can't get jQuery to loop over some table rows, I'm using this: jQuery('tr').each(function(index) { alert(index); });
[18:16:00] <bencahill> any ideas?
[18:16:48] <eddiemonge> bencahill: what does console.log ( jQuery('tr') ) give you?
[18:18:28] <bencahill> eddiemonge: never done this before, but Firebug shows length is 0
[18:18:41] <bencahill> eddiemonge: is that what I should be looking at? it appears as [ ]
[18:19:24] <eddiemonge> that means you dont have any trs on the page
[18:19:47] <bencahill> eddiemonge: oh, there's plenty...is js doing it's thing before the page has completed loading?
[18:20:02] <bencahill> eddiemonge: or perhaps these tr's are generated by other js?
[18:20:55] <bencahill> eddiemonge: the tr's are still there without js enabled, so it can't be that
[18:21:16] <eddiemonge> bencahill: is your code in a .ready() block?
[18:21:24] <bencahill> eddiemonge: no, should it be?
[18:21:35] <tomasm-> is there a way to call a function on a list of elements and return back an array of the results of that function?
[18:22:23] <eddiemonge> bencahill: yes otherwise you are executing code on nothing
[18:22:32] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: yes
[18:22:47] <bencahill> eddiemonge: okay, how do I combine that with selector matching?
[18:23:20] <bencahill> eddiemonge: like jQuery(document).ready(function($) { // stuff as before }); ?
[18:23:24] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, how?
[18:23:59] <eddiemonge> bencahill: yes
[18:24:12] <bencahill> awesome
[18:24:20] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: function () { return [1,2,3,4,5]; }
[18:25:21] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, no i mean take an arbitrary list (ie dom elements) and have a function called on each, and then return the results of that function into an array, similar to how php or perl has a map()
[18:25:39] <bencahill> eddiemonge: that worked, thanks so much! :-)
[18:26:13] <tomasm-> call a function on each item in an array and return the return values in a new array

[18:27:12] <CodeZombie> any help greatly appreciated, I'm about to lose it on this one
[18:27:28] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, does each() return an array? I need the return values of the function call back into a list I can loop over, etc
[18:27:40] <DualDetroit> MY JEANS ARE LOOSE
[18:27:44] <DualDetroit> MY CODE IS TIGHT
[18:27:52] <DualDetroit> BECAUSE I CAN'T RHYME

[18:28:39] <DualDetroit> MY SPEAKERS R LARGE; MY COCAINE IS IN CHARGE
[18:28:48] <eddiemonge> CodeZombie: why do you create the div with style and then immediately add more css?
[18:29:11] <CodeZombie> eddiemonge: that css being added is to position the element
[18:29:17] <CodeZombie> it's just proof of concept code atm
[18:29:22] <eddiemonge> CodeZombie: why not add it all at once?
[18:29:31] <CodeZombie> eddiemonge: irrelevant for the moment
[18:29:49] <DualDetroit> I AM FROM THE 313, THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY PHD!!!!
[18:30:04] * DualDetroit cuts some lines on his screen.
[18:30:14] <CodeZombie> eddiemonge: after I can get through this issue, the element will be a clone of a hidden "placeholder".
[18:30:22] <CodeZombie> the dummy element I'm creating isn't going to be in the final code
[18:30:54] <eddiemonge> is it /ignore to ignore someone here?
[18:31:12] * DualDetroit dances around the room holding his hat in his hand.
[18:31:21] <DualDetroit> eddiemonge: YES SIRRRRRRRRR
[18:31:46] <Spadeski> Sup people I have a simple checbox and it disables onclick now how do i get it to undisable
[18:32:13] <DualDetroit> Spadeski: You undisable it dawg!!!!!!!!!!
[18:32:16] <eddiemonge> you mean you disable the checkbox?
[18:32:18] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, I must be missing something.... I understand how to use each() and having a callback, but does each() itself return the return values? I dont see that documented (ie what each() itself returns when you assign it to something), though I could be missing that... I am not trying to loop through a list as much as I'm trying to translate a list to some other values

[18:34:54] <bencahill> how can I select child elements inside a .each ?

[18:35:25] <De-De-Detroit> bencahill .closest()
[18:35:31] <bencahill> eddiemonge: awesome, thanks again
[18:35:37] <tomasm-> how do I know whether a selector really returned an element versus is just an empty list? $(foo).get(0) ?

[18:38:29] <DualDetroit> De-De-Detroit: sure
[18:38:34] <lifewithryan> okay, has anyone seen an issue where javascript fails without error (just stops running) in IE7 without error, but if you call window.open() first, the js loads just fine
[18:38:52] <eddiemonge> no
[18:39:37] <lifewithryan> its honestly the strangest thing I've ever come across
[18:39:42] <eddiemonge> site?
[18:39:49] <eddiemonge> did you jshint your code?
[18:40:04] <lifewithryan> http://cpd-migration.compcc.com:8000
[18:40:09] <lifewithryan> and what is jshint?
[18:40:14] <eddiemonge> jshint.com
[18:40:21] <lifewithryan> lemme read that
[18:40:50] <lifewithryan> oh, like jslint -- no.  sadly i didn't write the code, one of my devs did
[18:41:08] <denysonique> Thank you guys for the help with hints about expanding a paragraph, I decided to create a simple plugin:
[18:41:08] <denysonique> http://denysonique.github.com/jquery-slidable/
[18:41:08] <denysonique> I hope some of you will find it useful
[18:41:14] <denysonique> the url is a demo
[18:41:29] <denysonique> s/is/contains/
[18:41:29] <eddiemonge> lifewithryan: theres a lot of problems in base.js
[18:41:45] <lifewithryan> k, i'll run it through jshint
[18:42:30] <lifewithryan> does that site take into account any sort of external dependencies, etc?
[18:43:04] <lifewithryan> like DEBUG is actually declared elsewhere in the base template
[18:43:10] <lifewithryan> before that js file loads
[18:43:56] <lifewithryan> and we have a tone of supporting js libraries that get loaded before base
[18:44:14] <gnarf> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/10/13/jquery-1-7-beta-2-released/
[18:44:24] <lifewithryan> so a lot of those undefined issue would go away

[18:51:04] <tomasm-> Math.min() seems to be returning NaN for any numerical lists I have, ie [ 10, 12, 13, 15 ] ... does that need to be converted to something else? or can I get the minimum value in that set?

[19:04:59] <coldhead> hi muzone
[19:06:05] <tomasm-> is there a way in jquery to detect whether a piece of text is wrapping in it's container or is on one line?
[19:09:53] <De-De-Detroit> Is there a way too check if div is empty?
[19:10:03] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: you could check the height
[19:10:28] <eddiemonge> De-De-Detroit: $(div).find('*').length < 1 === empty
[19:10:57] <tomasm-> how would i tell whether something is one line or two? unless i clone it, replace it with one character, and assume that is one line height worth
[19:10:57] <Brodingo> .is(:empty)
[19:11:00] <Brodingo> is that a thing
[19:11:12] <De-De-Detroit> Thanks eddiemonge
[19:11:17] <eddiemonge> ? :empty

[19:11:23] <eddiemonge> oh i guess it is
[19:11:26] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[19:13:58] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, any suggestions how to find out what one line height is (so i know what two, etc are)? i tried cloning the element but it has no height until it gets attached to the dom
[19:21:36] <tomasm->  comparing $(this).height() to $(this).css('line-height') seems to work

[19:40:00] <nathanw> hey can someone help me creating a basic shopping-style cart
[19:40:41] <nathanw> eddie: i realised what i'm trying to do is exactly the same as a shopping cart
[19:42:03] <rgr> is there really still no built in jquery method to zero a form (all edits empty and check unchecked etc)? in google some claim that val() "doe the right thing" but it doesnt.
[19:42:33] <rgr> nathanw: there are oodles of examples out there in google land.
[19:43:07] <Brandonn> nathanw: let's do this!
[19:43:40] <nathanw> rgr: it's val("")
[19:43:52] <rgr> no its not
[19:44:08] <rgr> you need to code specifically for checkboxes and remove the checked atribuite
[19:44:10] <rgr> attribute
[19:44:12] <De-De-Detroit> Sup people
[19:44:16] <nathanw> oh checkboxes
[19:44:27] <Brandonn> De-De-Detroit: hilarious nick
[19:44:30] <rgr> yes, a form with mixed input types
[19:44:32] <De-De-Detroit> rgr (this).attr
[19:44:33] <nathanw> i have a function that does that but toggles disabled
[19:44:40] <nathanw> you could easily change it to checked
[19:44:43] <De-De-Detroit> Brandonn Thank you :D
[19:44:44] <nathanw> Brandon: http://goo.gl/ZaXdL
[19:44:51] <rgr> that not what I am asking
[19:44:56] <rgr> I have a function too.
[19:45:29] <nathanw> Brandon: I've almost got it there... using a calculations jquery plugin.. but I'm not sure if it's going to do the job 100%
[19:46:08] <rgr> you need to sit down and ddefine your requirements and not change them as you currently seem to do based on what new snippet of jquery you have learnt. define the problem domain first.
[19:46:24] <nathanw> Brandon: It needs to add each item to the 'order/cart' and update the calculated %'s at the bottom based on what's added to the order rather than how I have it setup now
[19:46:24] <rgr> ie define "the job".
[19:48:22] <nathanw> Brandon?
[19:50:18] <Spadesky> woh woh

[19:56:46] <Hierofant> haha
[19:57:37] <abjorn> lowest plan is $9 but the uptime is better than most
[19:57:55] <abjorn> and support is awsum

[19:58:07] * abjorn flexes
[19:58:40] <Spadesky> Hierofant if you have an idea I got a host
[20:00:02] <abjorn> If you're looking for a VPS and you're not looking to resell hosting I'd highly recommend Linode though
[20:00:20] <Hierofant> nah, this is for a low-end client... vanity site for her design work
[20:00:31] <Hierofant> small level market
[20:00:42] <Hierofant> Spadesky do tell
[20:01:35] <abjorn> A lot of resellers of companies like HostGator are good choices for small websites like that. The bigger companies tend to have larger plans with "unlimited" everything, so if you don't need that, resellers have limited plans that are super cheap.
[20:03:20] <Spadesky> abjorn is there a free reseller host thats what i need lol

[21:48:39] <pootietang> anyone?
[21:48:51] <pootietang> a url would suffice
[21:56:15] <aka-> pootietang: give me an example of easing on click and I will show you how to do it on document ready ;)
[22:12:47] <pootietang> ok aka thanks

[22:19:06] <smsfail> can anyone tell me how to check if a class exists in any div in markup? i can't seem to find it
[22:20:34] <cbarton> Good evening out there, I have a question if anyone is up for it?
[22:20:55] <luite> smsfail: do you  mean $('div.class').length > 0  ?
[22:22:35] <smsfail> luite: hahahahaha. perfect!
[22:22:42] <smsfail> i knew it had to be simpler than I was making it
[22:22:45] <smsfail> luite: thanks
[22:25:38] <cbarton> I have an iframe to do cross domain POSTing, so I am using the postMessage() to do so… I need an ajax call to be asynchronous via that postMessage, so setting async: false will not work because it has to pass through the postMessage() (which is async natively).  I am using deferreds, however the order of instructions are still async, any suggestions?
[22:27:21] <pootietang> did you have a look aka?
[22:30:49] <ExpFist> Does anyone know if jplayer does seemless loops of audio?

[22:57:35] <smsfail> when I use "$('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 'slow');" it locks the scroll bar to the top for a few seconds :/ any ideas?
[22:58:57] <wib> Why do you apply the selector to both html and body?
[22:59:27] <kenneth> hey, if i have an element $('#whatever'), how can i grab the first child element that matches a selector '<a>
[23:01:06] <wookiehangover> .find('a:first')
[23:01:07] <eddiemonge> .find('a')
[23:01:20] <wookiehangover> eddiemonge wins
[23:01:48] <wookiehangover> actually if you want _just_ the first child a's
[23:01:57] <wookiehangover> .find('> a')
[23:02:11] <wookiehangover> that is, the immediate first child
[23:04:29] <smsfail> wib: not sure really
[23:04:33] <smsfail> should I only use one?
[23:04:39] <kenneth> sweet thanks!
[23:04:48] <kenneth> wookiehangover & eddiemonge :)
[23:06:22] <eddiemonge> .find('a').first() might be better performance wise
[23:06:28] <kenneth> another question, is it possible to modify the event data being passed to the handler, when i call $(something).click()
[23:07:09] <ExpFist> Maybe someone here has some insight for me
[23:07:13] <ExpFist> Safari and HTML5 audio
[23:07:27] <ExpFist> Does anyone have any idea why this listener doesn't fire?

[23:11:46] <poppiez> hi, is there a way for javascript to listen to custom jquery events? if I do $(document).trigger('own'); it doesn't seem like document.addEventListener('own', doStuff); does anything
[23:11:55] <thinkclay1> ya, i know it is.. dot notation still eludes me
[23:11:56] <Eviltwin> thinkclay1: object.x is the same thing as object['x'] or object["x"]
[23:12:05] <thinkclay1> oh really?
[23:12:15] <Eviltwin> thinkclay1: If you want to do object[variable], you can't do that with the dot notation
[23:12:21] <thinkclay1> So key => value arrays are really objects then?
[23:12:23] <kenneth> the chrome dev tools are fucking amazing, by the way. everytime i think they can't discover anything better, they blow my mind again
[23:12:28] <Eviltwin> thinkclay1: Everything's an object
[23:12:49] <ArchAdmin> is anybody here familiar with communitation with external entities in lucid dreams?
[23:12:56] <Eviltwin> poppiez: Not directly, no, there's no way for addEventListener to catch it
[23:13:06] <ArchAdmin> i think i was taken by one, but i didnt know what to do next
[23:13:11] <ArchAdmin> and i didnt know how to ask it about it
[23:13:24] <thinkclay1> hmm interesting. So if i set my var like i was as an settings[key] = value, you're saying i can just access it with settings.key?
[23:13:32] <poppiez> Eviltwin: can you think of an alternative?
[23:13:50] <Eviltwin> thinkclay1: No, but if you did var key = "foobar" and did settings[key] = value then settings.foobar
[23:13:54] <Eviltwin> That would work
[23:14:13] <Eviltwin> poppiez: jQuery's event system is internal to jQuery
[23:14:20] <Eviltwin> poppiez: You really need to use jQuery to interact with it
[23:15:03] <poppiez> Eviltwin: alright, will think of something else then. thank you
[23:15:29] <ArchAdmin> kenneth: chrome has google's backdoors built in however
[23:15:32] <ArchAdmin> don't use it
[23:15:41] <ArchAdmin> only in vm maybe
[23:15:43] <Eviltwin> thinkclay1: Does that make sense?
[23:16:14] <thinkclay1> somewhat. Im going to fiddle with it some more and see if i can figure it out
[23:16:30] <Eviltwin> thinkclay1: http://jsfiddle.net/9YjAb/2/
[23:18:08] <thinkclay1> Eviltwin: yep, i got now, thanks! JS feels so weird to me sometimes
[23:25:47] <ch3mi0n> Yo
[23:40:28] <mike_miller> I have a popover with resizing contents. What's the best way to have the popover animate when it resizes?
[23:40:40] <mike_miller> The popover resizes properly now, it just isn't animated.
[23:42:12] <sonja> is there a jquery add-on to make a SVG scale and be the same size as text, and look pretty no matter how big or small ?
[23:42:31] <sonja> or is that something i can do directly in html nowadays, either with a vector file or a huge png
[23:44:21] <underplay> Hey guys, im updating a site that uses jquery 1.3.2 and easing, does anyone know if i upgrade jquery to 1.8 and easing to 1.4/x will i have to change the functions/scripts i have?
[23:44:42] <underplay> I was hoping it would be backward compatible and im strained for time.
[23:45:24] <ch3mi0n> 1.8? O_O
[23:45:51] <underplay> well, thats what drupal 7 provides by default
[23:45:59] <ch3mi0n> Perhaps you mean jquery 1.6 or 1.7beta or jquery ui 1.8?
[23:46:08] <ch3mi0n> There is no jquery 1.8
[23:46:11] <ch3mi0n> ..yet
[23:46:27] <mydoghasworms> So someone here was saying yesterday that all function in jQuery are async. What about the tmpl plugin?
[23:46:40] <underplay> ah, you are correct
[23:46:52] <mydoghasworms> The tmpl() function causes a problem in IE, but not FF, because a portion of the screen that is rendered from tmpl() is not immediately accessible in IE, while in FF it is no problem.
[23:47:11] <ch3mi0n> I know :)
[23:47:13] <mydoghasworms> Are there some Javascript threading issues in IE's engine?
[23:47:51] <ch3mi0n> mydoghasworms: you might be trying to manipulate the DOM before it's ready (finished loading)
[23:48:45] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: To clarify, the DOM is loaded, but a portion of it is rendered from a template in a <div>. But yes, that appears to be the case only in IE.
[23:49:19] <mydoghasworms> So my next question is: Does tmpl() support some method of deferral or callback? I see no callback option in the docs.
[23:50:39] <ch3mi0n> mydoghasworms: no, and also wouldn't that be the opposite of what you want?
[23:50:48] <mydoghasworms> The irony is that tmpl() was the contribution of Microsoft developers, but this problem appears only in their browser.
[23:51:11] <ch3mi0n> If you defer parsing your template your DOM will be even more out of sync with whatever you're doing to it after it's ready
[23:51:13] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: No, the whole point is that I need to wait until that template has finished rendering, so I can access the elements in it.
[23:51:38] <ch3mi0n> mydoghasworms: yeah, so you don't want to defer the tmpl, you want to defer whatever else it is you're doing
[23:51:49] <ch3mi0n> To give the tmpl time to finish
[23:51:54] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n:  Yes, that is right.
[23:52:11] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: You have a way with words that I obviously lack. But you get me, man.
[23:53:07] <ch3mi0n> :P
[23:53:31] <ch3mi0n> mydoghasworms: I might be able to help if I knew what exactly you're doing or saw an example, or ... something
[23:53:35] <ExpFist> Does anyone have a mac + safari + firebug here? :F
[23:54:16] <ch3mi0n> I have a mac
[23:54:23] <ch3mi0n> I'm on it right now
[23:54:38] <ch3mi0n> ... it's running Linux only, though. lol
[23:54:46] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: I think I can work around this problem. I suppose there is no one supporting tmpl() as it has been in beta so long that I wonder if it's going to make it into the core.
[23:54:52] <ExpFist> :|
[23:55:13] <ch3mi0n> ExpFist: wish I could help
[23:55:28] <ch3mi0n> mydoghasworms: yeah I'm not too fond of tmpl
[23:55:41] <ch3mi0n> I prefer handlebars for templates
[23:55:54] <josh99> i use jcarousel and add items in run time. from some reason the carousel shows them but also shows infinite number of empty elements. any ideas?
[23:56:05] <ch3mi0n> !g handlebars template
[23:56:26] <ch3mi0n> <_<
[23:56:31] <ch3mi0n> >_>

[23:57:40] <predat0r> hi
[23:57:43] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: OK, thanks. I was looking at handlebars and mustache when looking for a template solution, but I decided to go for what looked the most "official", I guess that is not always a good guideline.
[23:57:44] <ch3mi0n> hi
[23:58:04] <ch3mi0n> tmpl always seemed very imcomplete to me
[23:58:07] <ch3mi0n> incomplete*
[23:58:42] <predat0r> guys what is "test" in !/^\d+$/.test(e.val())
