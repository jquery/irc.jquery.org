[00:00:00] <coldhead> why are you sending that stupid data anyway?
[00:00:04] <tilda> as if it doesnt get sent.
[00:00:14] <tilda> :) trying to send a large variable.
[00:00:23] <tilda> I see it fails on long strings.
[00:00:29] <coldhead> i think the variable might not be the problem
[00:00:42] <coldhead> because you can send entire email bodies via post
[00:00:44] <coldhead> with great success
[00:00:53] <ExpFist> Works on IE/Opera/Chrome/Firefox for me
[00:01:03] <raj> tilda, yep
[00:01:03] <tilda> post shouldnt be limited , I know.
[00:01:04] <raj> win7
[00:03:59] <rpk> chrome performs faster over rdp than firefox does live :/
[00:04:16] <tilda> hh, I know what is the bug.
[00:04:45] <tilda> JS trys to typecast it as numeric for some reason.
[00:05:25] <rpk> FF 3.6 is my new IE6
[00:14:39] <Cork> rpk: its ok, it's dead in 2 months
[00:14:51] <rpk> tell that to my employer
[00:16:08] <rpk> doing a select on a field of 10x16 and then changing toggling a style on the row the select finds has a visible delay :/
[00:16:58] <Cork> rpk: https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease
[00:17:04] <Cork> "EOL of Firefox 3.6 is 24th April 2012 (see ESR)."
[00:17:21] <Cork> it won't get security updates after that
[00:17:54] <rpk> hrm, so they're hope
[00:18:01] <Cork> ya
[00:18:09] <Cork> esr is ff10
[00:18:10] <rpk> actually hope enough that the problem will go away before my project even ends
[00:18:17] <Cork> and will stay for a year
[00:18:29] <rpk> dude, you just made my week
[00:18:43] <rpk> I've been fearing for the poor CS reps who are going to use this for the last couple days
[00:18:59] <rpk> (Been deving in chrome / aurora, just tried 3.6 around lunchtime today)
[00:19:22] <Cork> i barly test 3.6 anymore too ya
[00:19:41] <Cork> though 3.6 is still better then ie8
[00:19:50] <Cork> and it will be around for years to come
[00:21:36] <xmem> hi all, I have the following problem with ie7. "page is not responding due to a long-running script". Can someone help me please
[00:23:15] <xmem> without  jquery integration works
[00:26:21] <karega> anyone have a pageflip script that doesn't need HTML 5
[00:31:06] <raj> how do I change the value of an elem I'm cloning?
[00:31:19] <raj> i seem to only affect the original element
[00:31:22] <raj> not the cloned element
[00:31:26] <raj> i mean, not the clone
[00:40:55] <jrockjiggz> Hello
[00:42:18] <jrockjiggz> I have a weird bug on my site, at what seems to me random, i get this old school js dialog (ok/cancel) window pop up.. i've tried pausing scripting in chrome, and step by step, but it doesn't take me to where that window pops up.. any ideas how i can trouble shoot this? I've search the source for the text in the window, but nothing is coming up
[00:49:20] <anli_> Is there something like firebug for ie?
[00:49:34] <tilda> fiddler
[00:50:04] <Cork> anli_: no, you have the console in ie9, but its not even remotly like firebug
[00:50:21] <Cork> anli_: you could give firebug light a try
[00:50:30] <Cork> i've never liked it much my self though
[00:50:38] <anli_> I want to just get some script error messages, but I cannot even find a little yellow triangle anymore
[00:50:40] <tilda> anli : you can try fiddler
[00:50:59] <Cork> tilda: you mean jsfiddler?
[00:51:00] <tilda> anli : IE8 and up, press F12
[00:51:06] <anli_> ok
[00:51:22] <Cork> anli_: alternativly check => http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
[00:51:43] <tilda> Cork : yea, jsfiddler.   good for ie7 and down
[00:51:58] <Cork> tilda: but thats not a debug console
[00:52:06] <anli_> ok
[00:52:30] <tilda> no.. but good it help to see traffic/network headers.
[00:52:50] <anli_> Ah, ie doesnt like arrays having , after the last element
[00:53:05] <Cork> anli_: well its strictly not valid
[00:53:15] <Cork> javascript engins just allow it
[00:53:22] <Cork> (jscript doesn't)
[00:53:59] <anli_> seems that the ie console gives me error messages for the wrong lines
[01:05:36] <Xotix> hi
[01:08:46] <Flo0815> good morning guys
[01:08:51] <raj> goodmorning
[01:10:59] <raj> better Cork?
[01:11:00] <raj> :)
[01:11:08] <Cork> :D
[01:11:11] <Cork> use the delegate syncax and it should work
[01:11:16] <Cork> *syntax
[01:11:33] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/12/
[01:16:02] <raj> Cork, why document?
[01:16:16] <raj> $(.mychoice) doesn't update?
[01:16:18] <Cork> raj: any parent is ok
[01:16:24] <Cork> no it doens't
[01:16:32] <Cork> $() is the element the event is bound to
[01:16:43] <Cork> if you add a new element or similar its not affected
[01:16:55] <raj> interesting
[01:17:15] <Cork> so instead you bind it on a parent, and listen on what child element its comming from
[01:17:24] <karega> is there a solution to use the canvas tag on IE 7?
[01:17:26] <Cork> (its basically checking event.target)
[01:17:46] <raj> interesting
[01:17:48] <raj> thank you Cork
[01:17:50] <Cork> karega: with limitations theres a js fallback
[01:17:51] <raj> i'll try not to forget that
[01:18:17] <Cork> karega: http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/
[01:20:09] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/13/ @ raar
[01:20:12] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/13/@ raj even
[01:20:40] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[01:20:43] <BinaryKitten> my bad
[01:21:40] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/15/ instead
[01:21:47] <raj> am I missing something silly? http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/14/
[01:22:04] <BinaryKitten> raj yes
[01:22:12] <BinaryKitten> what item has a class of menu?
[01:22:14] <krz> I've got <li id="foo" class="bar"> I'm doing $('#foo').removeClass('bar') doesn't work? why?
[01:22:40] <BinaryKitten> krz  pastebin it
[01:22:43] <raj> sob
[01:22:44] <raj> thanks
[01:22:46] <BinaryKitten> might be something else
[01:22:46] <Cork> krz: too little context, that should work
[01:22:57] <BinaryKitten> raj also look at 15
[01:23:05] <BinaryKitten> it's slightly more performant
[01:23:12] <BinaryKitten> but only just
[01:23:38] <BinaryKitten> you might want to put some ids in there raj rather than all classes   ids do work the fastest for searching
[01:24:00] <raj> i wasn't sure of a good way to have an incrementing id in there
[01:24:07] <krz> firebug!
[01:24:21] <krz> $('#post_to_facebook').attr('class') returns nothing
[01:24:25] <krz> so the class doesn't exist
[01:24:31] <Cork> :D
[01:24:34] <krz> but the html tab still says the class is there
[01:24:54] <BinaryKitten> krz  the view source?
[01:24:58] <Cork> kraft: $('[id="post_to_facebook"]').length
[01:25:10] <Cork> if thats > 1 you know why you have problem
[01:25:22] <Cork> *krz
[01:25:39] <BinaryKitten> krz also.. is that in an iFrame?
[01:25:46] <krz> 1
[01:25:50] <raj> so I want an incrementing id attribute for each clone, and I wanna change the name of the <select> for each clone as well. http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/17/
[01:25:50] <BinaryKitten> a lot of FB stuff is done in an iframe
[01:26:02] <raj> I'm not sure how to access the clone though
[01:26:05] <krz> just a standard element BinaryKitten
[01:26:17] <BinaryKitten> raj ew
[01:26:19] <raj> what if I set all of line 2 = to a variable?
[01:26:31] <raj> BinaryKitten, what's eww about that?
[01:26:40] <BinaryKitten> raj why do you need to change ids?
[01:27:01] <raj> yeah, i guess I don't need to
[01:27:04] <BinaryKitten> also if you're cloning the form, you're not going to have 1 submit
[01:27:58] <raj> good point
[01:28:28] <BinaryKitten> also there is no </input> tag
[01:30:29] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/20/
[01:31:15] <BinaryKitten> raj http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/21/
[01:31:32] <BinaryKitten> ah no names on mine
[01:31:39] <BinaryKitten> but no messy dom search either
[01:32:27] <raj> beauty, so I just set it equal to a variable
[01:33:20] <Cork> raj: clone returns a now dom element wrapped in a jquery object
[01:33:35] <Cork> raj: if you want to modify it before you add it to the page, just store it in a variable
[01:34:18] <raj> Cork, very nice, thank you
[01:35:33] <BinaryKitten> raj  http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/22/
[01:36:24] <BinaryKitten> Cork nice work, but you had way way way to many dom searches with no fixed points
[01:36:59] <Cork> BinaryKitten: i didn't sit down and optimized his code, no
[01:37:05] <Cork> thats his job
[01:37:20] <BinaryKitten> no but your code that you added wasn't optimised either
[01:37:34] <BinaryKitten> takes no extra time to write good code
[01:37:39] <Cork> i just modified the code he used
[01:37:55] <Cork> as i don't know where he intend to use it i can't make assumptions
[01:38:47] <BinaryKitten> point. well made.
[01:39:07] <BinaryKitten> still not a big fan of lots of dom searches though :)
[01:39:16] <Cork> me neither
[01:39:33] * BinaryKitten just found e.target.parentElement
[01:39:34] <Cork> and i'm not a big fan of using id's either
[01:39:38] <Cork> but thats just me :)
[01:39:46] <BinaryKitten> why's that?
[01:40:07] <Cork> cause i tend to use a design where i do it in js instead
[01:40:13] <Cork> and just have references
[01:40:20] <Cork> makes for a more dynamic design
[01:40:24] <BinaryKitten> and IDs prevent that how?
[01:40:50] <Cork> if segment is added dynamically you need to increment the ids all over the place
[01:40:58] <BinaryKitten> ah yes
[01:41:10] <BinaryKitten> I would still have an id on the fixed parent though
[01:41:11] <niloy> how can I create a jquery object collection from individual DOM elements ?
[01:41:20] <BinaryKitten> but not in the extended section content
[01:41:38] <BinaryKitten> ?.add @ niloy
[01:41:39] <bot-t> niloy, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[01:41:39] <Cork> BinaryKitten: sure, but thats normally not that many on a page
[01:41:56] <niloy> BinaryKitten, thank you
[01:41:57] <BinaryKitten> Cork hear you on that one
[01:42:13] <BinaryKitten> niloy  you don't need to use the selector, you can pass the dom element directly
[01:42:22] <Cork> niloy: or you can just create an array of dom elements and run $(arr)
[01:42:45] <BinaryKitten> eg $(domelement1).add(domelement2)    or $([domelement1,domelement2])
[01:42:59] <Cork> the first won't do anything though
[01:43:00] <BinaryKitten> depends really on when you're adding an element to that collection
[01:43:03] <niloy> thanks guys
[01:43:17] <Cork> add returns the modification, so remember to reset the varaible
[01:43:25] <Cork> else nothing changes
[01:43:30] <niloy> okay
[01:43:41] <raj> can I select multiple values to remove? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/375508/removing-an-item-from-a-select-box
[01:44:05] <Cork> raj: comma separate the different selectors
[01:44:08] <raj> so option[value='option1', 'somethingelse']
[01:44:14] <BinaryKitten> raj are we going to code the whole thing for you?
[01:44:14] <raj> great :)
[01:44:16] <Cork> no
[01:44:32] <Cork> option[value='option1'], option[value='somethingelse']
[01:44:35] <raj> BinaryKitten, I didn't realize my questions weren't specific enough
[01:44:41] <raj> oh, got it
[01:45:00] <BinaryKitten> raj you're asking lots of specific questions yet
[01:45:02] <BinaryKitten> *yes
[01:45:19] <BinaryKitten> but that's the point you're asking us lots of specific questions in 1 specific area
[01:45:33] <BinaryKitten> which leads me to feel that we're coding this for you
[01:45:56] <Cork> BinaryKitten: the point with a comunity channel is to ask questions when you don't know what to do
[01:46:15] <BinaryKitten> Cork i understand the point of the channel
[01:46:32] <BinaryKitten> but the point is not to do someones's work for them carte blanche
[01:46:50] <raj> so when should a question be asked?
[01:47:27] <BinaryKitten> there is no hard and fast rule for that
[01:47:34] <Cork> BinaryKitten: the questions isn't on every part of the implementation so i don't see what your getting irritated over
[01:48:10] <BinaryKitten> Cork no malice or irritation
[01:48:22] <Cork> aha
[01:48:40] <BinaryKitten> just a small jest and jibe plus a small nudge (hopefully) in the direction of self determination and learning
[01:49:08] <bella> hi
[01:49:11] <BinaryKitten> you can give a man a fish and he'll feed himself for a day... blah blah
[01:49:19] <raj> you have no idea how much self learning I do
[01:49:31] <raj> not everyone went to school for this
[01:49:39] <BinaryKitten> I do not, which is why I've not ranted at you for it
[01:49:58] <Cork> raj: school is mostly a bad place to learn development anyway >_>
[01:50:10] <Cork> tinkering is the best way to rearn
[01:50:18] <BinaryKitten> raj .. but in turn you do not know how much self learning I do and have done or IF i even went to school for this
[01:50:43] <bella> can anyone help me? i know this is just so simple for you. how can i response or return in json data?
[01:50:45] <raj> yeah, but the learning curve was building the foundation...ever since, it's been a lot of fun coding, and learning coding
[01:51:08] <Cork> bella: IN json data??
[01:51:25] <BinaryKitten> raj yep and I'm not trying or wanting to take that away from you.. just trying to see if you're ready for the training wheels to come off
[01:51:58] <Cork> bella: can you explain a bit more what your trying to do?
[01:52:43] <BinaryKitten> anyway... I need to go to work. Catch you all soon
[01:54:02] <bella> i have a form from site 1 wherein they will type username then when they click validate form, the data will be send to Site 2 then it will verify is username exist on that Site 2 then will return true or false.
[01:54:14] <eshlox> hi, i have datetime string in format YYYYMMddHHmmss and i want get seconds from actual time - YYYYMMddHHmmss, how i can do this?
[01:55:18] <BinaryKitten> eshlox Date.parse will take your string
[01:55:39] <BinaryKitten> you should then get a Date object which you should be able to get the seconds from
[01:55:50] <bella> Cork, i has no redirection. when you click validate button it will display true or false right away
[01:55:56] <inc0> hi, I have case, where I'm changing src of a img dynamically, how can I fire up function whenever this img loads?
[01:56:23] <BinaryKitten> inc0 put the .load before the src change
[01:56:32] <BinaryKitten> as soon as you set the src it starts to load
[01:56:52] <Cork> bella: your using ajax or?
[01:57:03] <inc0> BinaryKitten, I'll try, tyvm
[01:57:10] <bella> Cork, im using jquery
[01:57:35] <Cork> uh...
[01:57:53] * Hooloovoo sits back and enjoys
[01:57:54] <Cork> bella: your doing a normal post or an ajax call to the server?
[01:58:06] <BinaryKitten> to site2?
[01:58:09] <BinaryKitten> from site1?
[01:58:17] <BinaryKitten> cross domain issues?
[01:58:38] <Cork> BinaryKitten: canÃ¤t say that until you know what hes doing
[01:58:41] <bella>                     $.post('site2.php'                          ,{                             lname: $('#lname').val()                             , fname: $('#fname').val()                           },                          function(data) { 							 							$('#site2_reply').text(data);                          },                          "json"                     )
[01:58:42] <Cork> *can't
[01:58:51] <Cork> ?p @ bella
[01:58:51] <bot-t> bella, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:59:04] <Cork> never EVER dump it in the channel
[01:59:46] <bella> ohh sorry
[02:00:11] <bella> it has $.post('site2.php'
[02:00:23] <Cork> ok so your using ajax
[02:00:33] <Cork> and site2 is the name of a php file?
[02:00:41] <Cork> or is it a different domain?
[02:01:15] <bella> it will post the data to site2 then site2 will check on their server if the username exist then will answert true or false then site 1 will display if true or false
[02:01:27] <bella> its on different domain
[02:01:43] <Cork> ok your using cors on that server?
[02:02:04] <bella> what do u mean by cors?
[02:02:42] <barnabywalters> bella https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing
[02:03:01] <Cork> bella: if your doing ajax from one domain to another the browser will block you
[02:03:03] <bella> the user could only see the site1 and they will not see site2
[02:03:23] <Cork> bella: cors is a construct to allow the server to allow it to happen anyway
[02:03:29] <Cork> (though ie doens't support it)
[02:04:30] <bella> ok. do you have any suggestion?
[02:05:23] <eshlox> BinaryKitten: ok, but i must convert this string to another format? there is no function that example do stringTodate(string, 'YYYYmmddHHMMss')? ;-)
[02:05:38] <Cork> bella: well if you need it support, your best option is to proxy the connection over your site1 server
[02:05:49] <Cork> *need ie support
[02:06:47] <bella> or can i just post the username in URL like site2.php?name="abc";
[02:07:01] <bella> i mean can i juts use get
[02:07:28] <Cork> bella: you could use a grab script solution and do it through js
[02:07:36] <Cork> (also called jsonp)
[02:07:42] <raj> can I create a jquery object that consists of two elements?
[02:07:51] <Cork> raj: yes
[02:07:55] <raj> a <p> and <select>
[02:08:32] <Cork> either do several selectors in the select string or you can merge objects
[02:08:54] <raj> separated with commas?
[02:08:58] <raj> oh, i just found the page
[02:09:01] <raj> k, cool
[02:09:02] <Cork> raj: or did you mean create the dom elements and wrap them in a jquery object?
[02:09:16] <raj> nono, i meant get ahold of two existing elements and clone them both
[02:09:19] <raj> instead of one at a time
[02:10:47] <bella> cork how can jsonp transfer data?
[02:10:56] <raj> Cork, if I do $clone = $('p', this).clone() , how can I modify just `this` or just `p` within $clone?
[02:11:01] <raj> bella, you transfer with ajax
[02:11:15] <Cork> bella: you do a get call to the sever
[02:11:25] <Cork> raj: no
[02:11:29] <bella> site 1 must send the username to site2 to verify and site1 will display the result to user.
[02:12:18] <Cork> bella: you can use $.getJSON or $.ajax
[02:12:21] <bella> site2 has the database
[02:12:32] <Cork> bella: it will help you create the jsonp javascript tag call
[02:13:01] <Cork> bella: the server then needs to respond with a script file containing a function with the response
[02:13:19] <Cork> jquery will give the server a callback variable, its the name the function should have
[02:13:24] <Cork> ?jsonp

[02:17:48] <Cork> bella: check the link up there
[02:27:24] <raj> Cork, 'no' meaning i'm not able to modify the <p> within $('select p')
[02:27:36] <raj> wait, select p isn't right
[02:27:57] <raj> $('select', 'p')
[02:28:05] <Cork> thats not a valid selector
[02:28:22] <raj> oh
[02:28:25] <Cork> is $('select, p') what your looking for?
[02:28:44] <raj> yes
[02:28:46] <raj> it is

[02:33:07] <JoeyCadle> Anyone familiar w/ jQuery-UI and datepicker() please can you look at http://beta.cityhint.com/files (click a listing, then checkmark any service). When datepicker loads it loads large. Is there a reason it's loading so large?
[02:33:48] <JoeyCadle> I tried modifying the jquery-ui theme's .css to specify even fixed width but it's still huge.
[02:34:30] <JoeyCadle> Fontsize issue maybe?
[02:43:59] <Deiu> Is there a way to pass the contents of an ajax GET to an external callback function (say some PHP code maybe)?
[02:46:38] <Robbington> Hi, have a bug that I am struggling to fix, I have a live() event on a an a tag in a scroller, works fine, but when you us the draggable scroll bar it doesnt work. Any ideas?
[02:49:30] <Spikes> guys, anyone know how to handle element position in webkit browsers WHEN said element has rotate transformation?
[02:51:08] <Spikes> Oh, apparently it's not only webkit. Looks like opera and webkit actually does the right thing and calculate element position based on it's angle. Only firefox shows position as if element has to rotation
[02:54:46] <beasty> just pondering is it me or is regex slow in javascript ?
[02:56:08] <Cork> beasty: depends on your syntax
[02:56:13] <Cork> and on the js engin
[02:56:51] <Cork> beasty: but ya, regex isn't a magic speed bullet :)
[03:00:46] <beasty> Cork: that's just evil
[03:00:56] <beasty> to bad it's only showing the first result :(
[03:01:41] <Cork> beasty: you can compile regex
[03:01:48] <Cork> and then ask it again to get the next value
[03:02:03] <Cork> compiled regex'es are faster too
[03:04:54] <beasty> Cork: compiled regex ?
[03:06:11] <Cork> beasty: var ex = new Regex('/regex/', 'g');
[03:06:15] <JoeyCadle> anyone know how to not highlight the current day in jquery-ui datepicker() inline?
[03:06:28] <Cork> sorry RegExp
[03:07:44] <Cork> beasty: ah :/
[03:07:49] <Cork> .compile is depricated >_>
[03:07:56] <beasty> Cork: well i changed from RegExp.exec() to String.match() :p
[03:08:01] <beasty> lot's faster
[03:08:12] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Deprecated_Features#RegExp_Methods
[03:08:39] <Cork> beasty: well ya, if you don't absolutly need regex, don't use it
[03:08:53] <Cork> pure string compare will always be faster (nomatter what language)
[03:09:27] <gyaresu> I need a bit of direction as to where I'm going wrong. I helped this guy out with the similar problem but I can't fix it myself. Twitter 'share' button in a Google Maps InfoWindow. Appreciate any pointers.

[03:10:21] <gyaresu> Or a shorter url http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9802065/
[03:10:41] <larsemil> is this doable

[03:16:29] <Larholm> coppa, I would expect that "target" is where I insert my data
[03:17:29] <Larholm> <a href="moo.html" ajax-content="#moocontent" ajax-target="#mycurrentpagecontainer"> is how I would probably use it
[03:18:08] <larsemil> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ZvMFn/ thought this would do, but no.
[03:18:09] <hrwath> coppa, is it yours?
[03:20:59] <Cork> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/ZvMFn/1/
[03:21:23] <Cork> you overcomplicated it :D
[03:21:25] <shwaiil> Q: you guys know about using the scroll position as a timeline ? Where can I get more information about this ? Like a tutorial etc. One example but not the best I found ( http://www.inception-explained.com/ ), tks
[03:21:42] <larsemil> Cork: yeah found out. :)
[03:22:10] <coppa> hrwath: yes !
[03:22:24] <hrwath> coppa, I've sent a pull request, check it out
[03:22:32] <coppa> ok
[03:24:11] <coppa> hrwath: done, thanks !
[03:24:59] <hrwath> coppa, you're welcome :)
[03:25:57] <coppa> if you want some example i'm using it there http://marinarossa.useradgents.com/ and there http://www.dixseptieme.fr/?url=home
[03:27:06] <coppa> Larholm: target is where you get your data from the destination page and ajax-referrer where you insert it in the current page
[03:35:54] <Larholm> coppa, it's just a confusing naming scheme that conflicts with your ordinary <a href="moo.html" target="WINDOWORIFRAMENAME">

[03:58:39] <poppiez> hi, $.browser.safari reports true on chrome on mac. why is this?
[04:01:01] <godfreyhk_> the browser plugin does not actually detects the browser being used
[04:01:40] <godfreyhk_> poppiez it detects the rendering engine. $.browser.safari is deprecated, you're supposed to use $.browser.webkit, which would return true for both safari and chrome
[04:01:58] <godfreyhk_> poppiez see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[04:03:03] <beepbeep_> so, I have an iframe which loads a page that has a sort of pop-up script, u know, the ones that gray your screen and show something nice. Okay. Now. It obviously grays out the content inside the iframe, good. Is it possible for me to trigger a script on my current page by clicking on something in the iframe?
[04:05:30] <poppiez> godfreyhk_: why is that deprecated if you need to figure out if you're on safari?
[04:06:17] <Pupeno_W> Is there an event triggered on each character change in an input tetx?
[04:06:58] <godfreyhk_> poppiez: why is it deprecated? I didn't write the plugin, I don't know
[04:07:08] <poppiez> alright. well thx :)
[04:07:43] <godfreyhk_> poppiez: there might be other libraries that does that. but just curious, what is your use case for needing to differentiate different webkit breeds?
[04:07:48] <jsk143> gud eve to every1
[04:07:49] <godfreyhk_> Pupeno_W: keydown?
[04:08:52] <godfreyhk_> beepbeep_: it will be quite difficult, in general it's probably impossible unless you have control over both the iframes. but it'll probably require more work than you might be willing to put in
[04:09:00] <jsk143> http://jsfiddle.net/q5Wqz/3/  can any 1 help me how to do....i have a list of links with next and prev button and want to display currently 3 link at the time.............
[04:09:03] <godfreyhk_> beepbeep_: in general, just avoid iframes
[04:10:36] <godfreyhk_> jsk143 I believe twitter bootstrap's pagination behave exactly the way you described, so you might want to just check how they did it (it's just CSS, no JS required)
[04:10:38] <poppiez> godfreyhk_: I'm doing some animations but chrome is still really buggy so I want to exclude it
[04:11:44] <godfreyhk_> poppiez: interesting... do you mind sharing the kind of bugs you're seeing? (are you doing css transformations or some other fancier animations?)
[04:12:47] <godfreyhk_> poppiez: I always assumed the latest version of all webkit browsers behave similarly enough that I can just treat them as the same thing. so if there are important differences (performance and whatnot) then i'll be sure to watch out for those in the future
[04:12:50] <keber> www.hot.ee/keber/satan.JPG
[04:14:07] <godfreyhk_> jsk143 nvm, I lied
[04:15:04] <jsk143> wt?  @godfreyhk
[04:15:51] <poppiez> godfreyhk_: well, not bugs exactly. performance just isn't great on chrome when hardware acceleration isn't enabled
[04:16:08] <poppiez> so I want to fallback to $.animate on chrome if no hardware acceleration is present
[04:16:39] <godfreyhk_> poppiez: I see. Would you happen to know if that's enabled by default on recent builds?
[04:17:03] <poppiez> godfreyhk_: AFAIK hardware acceleration is still experimental in chrome
[04:17:41] <godfreyhk_> poppiez Thanks!
[04:18:29] <jsk143> @godfreyhk am not askin design....functionality wise whenever click ill show next 3 links ....like that
[04:19:22] <godfreyhk_> jsk143: I know. I recall from memory that they did the exact same thing with pure CSS, but apparently they didn't
[04:19:55] <jsk143> mmmmmmm k
[04:23:09] <godfreyhk_> jsk143 but anyways that wouldn't be difficult at all
[04:23:25] <godfreyhk_> you just add an "active" class to the active link
[04:23:50] <jsk143> k ill try and get back to u
[04:23:53] <jsk143> thankzzzzzzz
[04:24:04] <godfreyhk_> then hide all links, $( active ).show().prev().show().end().next().show()
[04:24:08] <godfreyhk_> something like that
[04:36:46] <Larholm> coppa, I would change ajax-target to ajax-content and change ajax-referrer to ajax-target
[04:39:48] <bizzeh> with jqueryui tabs, if i have more tabs that i can fit on a single row, the tabs begin a new row, is there any way to keep all the tabs on a single row, but have the tabs so that you have to scroll, or have a drop down button at the end in the way that photoshop cs5 does?
[04:40:07] <gsk> i hide() a div and in the same function i show() another one. but the show() starts while the hide() is not finished. so now i want to know a way to start the show() after the hide() is finished.. someone can help me out here?
[04:40:43] <Larholm> gsk, look at animate and its success functions
[04:41:08] <gsk> what you mean with success functions
[04:41:33] <Larholm> http://api.jquery.com/animate/ and complete
[04:41:52] <Larholm> http://api.jquery.com/show/ also has a callback
[04:42:08] <Larholm> $("#moo").show("fast", function(){ alert("finished showing") })
[04:43:30] <DaveJ|UK> How do I get the index of an accordion h3 from the h3's id attribute in order to activate it?
[04:43:43] <pfig> Hi, I'm having an issue with a webserver behind HTTPS, where .load() uses HTTP. Has anyone come across this? I can't seem to find a definitive answer to the problem online.
[04:43:55] <gsk> so i can shufle the callbacks?
[04:44:15] <pfig> Shouldn't load() just use the document's protocol?
[04:44:47] <DaveJ|UK> pfig: If your url uses https: then you need to use https in all images, css, ajax etc. or the user will be warned about insecure el;ements on the page
[04:45:04] <DaveJ|UK> since the callback is hidden from the user, they wont see the warning so they dont even have the choice to accept it
[04:45:28] <pfig> yeah, but all that is relative, and it's coming over HTTPS
[04:45:44] <DaveJ|UK> you're using a relative url for the callback?
[04:45:53] <pfig> load(), however, is using HTTP.
[04:46:05] <DaveJ|UK> try specifying an absolute url that uses https
[04:46:36] <pfig> e.g., if page.html is served over HTTPS and contains a load("/ajax/foo"), shouldn't that load() use HTTPS as well?
[04:46:46] <DaveJ|UK> yes it should
[04:46:56] <DaveJ|UK> try with an absolute url
[04:47:03] <DaveJ|UK> if it works then it sounds like you found a bug
[04:47:50] <pfig> Yeah, I'll need to clear browser data, as load() sent a 301. Brb.
[04:52:39] <dgx> godfreyhk_: Yes, thanks that does the trick.
[05:23:45] <VictorCl> hi
[05:24:18] <VictorCl> if I do this :  $('#origen-calle').val().replace(/ /g,"%20");   I get  "a is undefined"  , but $('#origen-calle').val() works fine
[05:24:23] <VictorCl> why is replace() causing that error?
[05:25:38] <ravenzz> \s
[05:25:40] <ravenzz> for spaces
[05:27:55] <ravenzz> VictorCl anyway you can use escape() if you are dealing with urls
[05:28:06] <ravenzz> ?eval escape("foo bar");
[05:28:09] <bot-t> ravenzz: "foo%20bar"
[05:28:28] <ravenzz> I have to go bye

[05:30:16] <xec_> what up bot-t
[05:30:17] <bot-t> xec_, It is decidedly so.
[05:30:31] <xec_> yay, just a little slow.
[05:30:36] * xec_ hugs bot-t
[05:30:36] <StevenCodes> xec_: boss
[05:30:36] * bot-t hugs xec_ back
[05:31:13] <fRAiLtY-> In Magento how do I perform an AJAX request on the database. I already have the php method used to grab data from the database so basically need to re-run this php method with AJAX
[05:31:25] <xec_> StevenCodes: hugo
[05:31:43] <xec_> fRAiLtY-: what is Magento?
[05:31:50] <VictorCl> cook escape was my solution thanks
[05:32:02] <StevenCodes> xec_:  The movie? lol
[05:34:13] <ShawnRisk> How do I get iPad css hover to work? Â I have read many different ideas on websites, but wanted to know what the exact answer is?
[05:37:35] <D4> How can I easily just allow numeric 0-9 in my inputs and NOTHING else using jQ? I can't use keyCode because it's bugged in devices.
[05:38:02] <D4> Simply regex only allowing [0-9]{2} as in 2 digits 0-9.
[05:38:14] <Zogot> d4 change the input to number, on mobiles it opens a different input
[05:38:15] <Zogot> iirc
[05:38:20] <D4> or, actually I've set the maxlength="2" so simply just 0-9 would do >_<
[05:38:29] <D4> No, input type="tel" does, on iDevices
[05:38:35] <D4> actually, iPhones* iPad does not
[05:39:47] <D4> ShawnRisk » There's no hover for iPads, you don't have a mouse to hover. But you need to add this to your elements be able to use :hover -> ontouchstart=""
[05:40:11] <D4> e.g. <a href="#" ontouchstart="">My Button</a> and then a:hover {} and it'll "work" in devices.
[05:40:50] <ShawnRisk> D4: what is ontouchstart?
[05:41:21] <D4> Google it. Basically the default behavior on iPads etc can't recognize :hover, I had this issue some time ago as well.
[05:41:37] <D4> It's device-specific anyway afaik.
[05:42:36] <D4> Anyway, jQuery related: Allowing numbers only for a input, how does one accomplish this without any plugins and bs? Simply a regex for the input'd do.
[05:43:51] <Cork> D4: listen on keydown and halt the event if you don't want the character
[05:44:01] <D4> Cork what event?
[05:44:13] <Cork> "keydown"
[05:44:29] <D4> Yes but how'd I specify the characters allowed?
[05:44:42] <Cork> event.charCode
[05:44:49] <DaveJ|UK> Is it really an issue? People don't really use iPads, they just pose with them and dick around with the occasional game.
[05:44:50] <D4> As stated using their keyCode/charCode isn't working in devices.
[05:45:33] <Cork> there isn't any other way except type="number"
[05:45:34] <D4> Yes, I wouldn't be asking otherwise - It's a iPad specific version of a page, it needs to function as intended in the pad!
[05:45:41] <Cork> (as far as i know)
[05:46:04] <D4> Hmmph, well.. I tried allowing the keyCodes of 48-57, which should be number sonly
[05:46:43] <D4> !@& and other characters were still available through the pad, so they're somehow also allowed when checking for 48-57 for some odd reason.
[05:46:44] <Cork> you might need to test what the different codes is when you use the input
[05:47:26] <VictorCl> input type="radio" onchange="seleccionaSeleccioCandidat(this)">  how can I pass (this) to the that onchange function . so inside that function I can use it in jquery ?
[05:48:21] <D4> actually Cork, it seems it isn't iPad specific, checking for keyCodes 47-58 generally allows for ! and & and @..
[05:48:25] <Cork> VictorCl: your passing it as the first variable
[05:48:49] <VictorCl> what do yo mean?
[05:49:09] <VictorCl>   onchange="funcionname(this)" is not working :(
[05:49:12] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/ry5a3/ <-- check it out.
[05:49:27] <Cork> VictorCl: function seleccionaSeleccioCandidat(elm) {}
[05:51:21] <ShawnRisk> D4: I shouldn't do this: http://blog.0100.tv/2010/05/fixing-the-hover-event-on-the-ipadiphoneipod/
[05:52:02] <D4> "If you’re having problems getting hovered elements to fire you could also try using touchstart or touchend which is probably a better method depending on what you’re trying to accomplish"
[05:52:20] <D4> Basically what I told you to do ;p ontouchstart=""
[05:53:55] <D4> --- http://jsfiddle.net/ry5a3/1/  <-- what am I doing wrong? Typing an exclamation mark is allowed etc.
[05:54:06] <benoo> hello
[05:55:13] <ShawnRisk> D4: I know what you said, I was just looking at all solutions
[05:56:27] <D4> ShawnRisk » I'd say it depends on how many "hovering" buttons you need functioning, myself only had 1 I needed the 'hover' state on, like.. onClick but in CSS. So I simply put onToushstart="" on the element and :hover worked. If you want to target everything etc do as that says
[05:57:10] <ShawnRisk> D4: okay thanks
[05:58:03] <benoo> i was wondering if there is a possibility to alter the default behavior of the slideToggle() method so that parts of a page slide left or right instead of up or down
[05:58:38] <roel> Hello, I have a bind on document.body to hide an "position:absolute"-div. In this div, i have a datepicker. Now when I select a date (in the datepicker, dialog) my document.body click gets triggerd. Now i'm searching how i can run event.stopPropagation() when selecting a date?
[05:59:06] <melter> does anyone know if the new plugins site will be available soon?
[06:00:08] <VictorCl> how can I replace anything that inside (text)   like    var = "this text (removethis)"
[06:00:32] <DaveJ|UK> grab the text, replace it, then write it back
[06:01:03] <DaveJ|UK> ...
[06:01:08] <DaveJ|UK> str.Replace()
[06:01:51] <VictorCl> will this work   replace(/\(|\)/g, '');
[06:01:56] <VictorCl> I am not very good with regex
[06:02:11] <DaveJ|UK> no shit
[06:03:01] <DaveJ|UK> Do you want to strip everything after and including the first (
[06:03:20] <VictorCl> I want to strip the whole thing   ( text )
[06:03:26] <VictorCl> the parenthesis and the text inside
[06:03:35] <DaveJ|UK> what if there is something after the ()
[06:04:02] <VictorCl> I dont know if there may be stuff ater ... it shouldn be . but  I can't be sure
[06:04:12] <VictorCl> is something that comes from webservices .. you never trust
[06:05:08] <DaveJ|UK> \(.*\)
[06:05:12] <VictorCl>    /\(.*?\)/g
[06:05:35] <VictorCl> ok thanks , will test
[06:06:14] <DaveJ|UK> get yourself a regex reference, it's not hard
[06:06:43] <coppa> Larholm: okay thx I gonna look at that
[06:08:00] <Hawkee> how do I access the options of a widget within a user defined function inside the widget?
[06:08:13] <devmikey> Question: Why does the following not work as I desire:
[06:08:55] <devmikey> $('#Image').attr("src","images/img1.jpg").fadeOut(10000);
[06:09:06] <devmikey> $('#Image').attr("src","images/img2.jpg").fadeIn(10000);
[06:09:30] <devmikey> I want it to display img1, fade it out, then fade the new image in
[06:09:49] <devmikey> Instead it starts with img2, then fades it out and in
[06:12:45] <Cork> devmikey: you need to use the callback
[06:16:25] <devmikey> was just in the middle of trying that, and yep
[06:17:11] <devmikey> Cork: But suppose I want to fade in and out in a loop?
[06:17:22] <devmikey> Recursion?
[06:17:36] <devmikey> Recursion that never ends?
[06:17:42] <devmikey> no base case
[06:24:49] <Cork> devmikey: yes recurtion
[06:25:16] <Cork> devmikey: and if you want to delay each itteration use setTimeout

[06:30:47] <Cork> so not posible
[06:31:10] <fn> realy?
[06:31:11] <fn> oh ):
[06:31:26] <Cork> nateb: href? it should be the htpmelement
[06:31:26] <rroelofs> unless you have some way to insert  script into the iframe
[06:31:31] <Cork> *htmlelement
[06:31:59] <fn> i have full access fo the iframe
[06:32:06] <fn> and the content-code for the main page
[06:33:56] <rroelofs> fn:  in good browsers you may be able to use postMessage
[06:34:12] <Cork> not cross domain
[06:34:26] <rroelofs> here's an article with some info.  it's ugly but possible.  http://softwareas.com/cross-domain-communication-with-iframes
[06:34:39] <joris> Hi. What could be the reason for .focus() not firing on my text input?
[06:34:52] <Flo0815> joris: jquery mobile?
[06:34:55] <joris> No JS errors
[06:34:57] <joris> Flo0815: nope
[06:35:01] <mattyh88> hey, i'd like to bind a change event to an input field, after that input field has been dynamically added to the page with the after() function. I've bound this change event after I did the append like so:  http://pastebin.com/dyYYNbZD but it doesn't work. The logentry isn't added in the console.
[06:35:15] <Flo0815> joris: does it find the desired element via the selector?
[06:35:29] <joris> yep
[06:35:45] <fn> hm okey
[06:35:49] <Flo0815> joris: tried on('focus' ...
[06:35:50] <Flo0815> ?
[06:35:56] <joris> nope, trying
[06:36:19] <joris> nope, doesn't do anything
[06:36:43] <Flo0815> live('focus' ...
[06:36:45] <Flo0815> ?
[06:37:00] <joris> nopes, nussing
[06:37:19] <Flo0815> $('element').length says what?
[06:37:35] <joris> 1
[06:37:42] <Flo0815> what the...
[06:37:58] <nateb> Cork: it's returning the link
[06:38:09] <joris> Flo0815: http://pastie.org/3647896
[06:38:21] <joris> <input type="text" name="Search" id="searchbox" value="Search">
[06:38:31] <Cork> nateb: whats returning the link?
[06:38:39] <Cork> you mean this == a string?
[06:39:12] <nateb> Cork: $('.tierprices a').click(function(e){ ... }  Inside that, this = the href for a
[06:39:19] <devmikey> Cork: Are you sure you didnt mean delay()?
[06:39:29] <Flo0815> joris: what's the 2nd function?
[06:39:36] <joris> unfocus
[06:39:39] <Flo0815> i think focus doesn't have a second function
[06:39:42] <joris> really
[06:39:58] <Flo0815> http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[06:40:00] <Cork> devmikey: delay works on the jquery queue system, and yes i didn't mean delay
[06:40:01] <joris> I assumed it would work like hover()
[06:40:04] <joris> let's see
[06:40:49] <Cork> devmikey: the reason you get the problem is cause attr() doesn't queue
[06:40:50] <mattyh88> hey, i'd like to bind a change event to an input field, after that input field has been dynamically added to the page with the after() function. I've bound this change event after I did the append like so:  http://pastebin.com/dyYYNbZD but it doesn't work. The logentry isn't added in the console.
[06:41:15] <joris> Flo0815: Thanks. I feel dumb now.
[06:41:26] <Flo0815> joris: nvm :)
[06:41:30] <Cork> devmikey: you get fadeOut call > url change > fadein call > fadeout animaton starts
[06:41:39] <Flo0815> mattyh88: use .on('change' ...
[06:41:46] <devmikey> Cork: I have something working for me atm
[06:42:08] <nateb> Cork: did that make sense or am I thinking it should work differently?  I feel like the this keyword should be the element
[06:42:40] <Flo0815> .change() works only for elements which are existent before the eventhandler
[06:42:42] <Cork> nateb: it makes sence, but it leaves things out for enterpritation
[06:42:55] <Cork> nateb: is this a string with the url in or is it something else?
[06:43:10] <nateb> Cork: it's a string with the url
[06:43:15] <Cork> ok
[06:43:20] <kibble> has anyone used xajax?
[06:43:56] <Cork> nateb: and your sure $ is jquery and not another framework?
[06:44:11] <Cork> nateb: try checking $.fn.jQuery
[06:44:16] <beasty> throw your hands up!
[06:44:19] <mattyh88> Flo0815: doesn't it exist when i put that change event after the append of the new input field?
[06:44:47] <mattyh88> Flo0815: the input field is added with ID etc .. and then i bind the change event? :)
[06:44:50] <Flo0815> mattyh88: no,
[06:44:51] <mattyh88> ah
[06:44:54] <devmikey> I cant find setTimeout() in the Jquery api.  I guess you mean the JS function?
[06:45:08] <Cork> ?mdc setTimeout @ devmikey
[06:45:09] <bot-t> devmikey, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[06:45:24] <Cork> devmikey: its a pure js call
[06:45:35] <nateb> Cork: hmm, no other frameworks are loaded, but $.fn.jQuery is undefined, but I'm trying to log in within my click listener
[06:45:42] <nateb> confusing
[06:45:56] <kibble> or I guess better question has anyone tried to marry php and jquery to function the way xajax does?
[06:45:58] <Cork> ok so something is overwriting $
[06:46:07] <salientKnight> hey all
[06:46:07] <beasty> orly ?
[06:46:08] <Cork> nateb: try jQuery(selector)
[06:46:09] <hobs> I will officiate the marriage
[06:46:28] <salientKnight> is there a way to change out an image that has no id or class?
[06:46:43] <kibble> salientKnight: how are you planning to reference it?
[06:46:48] <Cork> salientKnight: as long as you have some way to specify where it is
[06:46:50] <salientKnight> that's what I'm asking :)
[06:47:07] <Cork> if its relative to another element or similar its doable
[06:47:15] <kibble> there are lots of ways to do it but really having an ID is certainly best
[06:47:21] <Cork> he left
[06:47:30] <salientKnight> oops
[06:47:35] <nateb> Cork: -_- jQuery acted normal, then $ started working as well, not sure what the deal was
[06:47:47] <salientKnight> sorry, so there are classes in the div around it
[06:48:07] <Cork> salientKnight: $('.class-around img')
[06:48:13] <kibble> salientKnight: can't you put an ID on the img tag at least?
[06:48:37] <salientKnight> kibble, not easily, I would have to hack the module
[06:49:06] <salientKnight> Cork I tried that, but there is nothing unique
[06:49:23] <erebel55> is there anyway to have this slider change my js variable zoom, instead of an html element like amount? http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/23/
[06:49:24] <Cork> you could select on the href, though that should be a last resort
[06:49:39] <salientKnight> can I select on the src?
[06:49:43] <Cork> yes
[06:49:46] <Cork> sorry src :)
[06:50:02] <salientKnight> how would that look? I tried doing that and think I got the syntax wrong
[06:50:18] <Cork> $('.class-around img[src$="img.png"]')
[06:50:54] <mattyh88> Flo0815: would delegate() be another solution to my problem?
[06:51:12] <salientKnight>        $($(img[src='/images/slide-1-outcomes.jpg'])[0].attr('src','/images/slide-2-benefits.jpg');
[06:51:16] <salientKnight> this is what I tried
[06:51:24] <Flo0815> mattyh88: never worked with delegate  but i think not. That's why .on() was introduced
[06:51:32] <salientKnight> Cork, there is no unique class
[06:51:44] <nateb> so you can't call .attr on htmlelements?
[06:51:50] <mattyh88> ah just looked it up, it's the equivalent of .on :)
[06:52:00] <Cork> nateb: $(this).attr
[06:52:21] <mattyh88> ah no sorry
[06:52:24] <mattyh88> you're right :p
[06:52:25] <mattyh88> hehehe
[06:52:27] <mattyh88> .on is newer
[06:54:16] <nateb> Cork: ohh, I was just doing this.attr, I see now
[06:54:16] <salientKnight> Cork, http://pastebin.com/QzAuscJc here is the code...is there a way to use just the src?
[06:54:36] <Cork> salientKnight: $('img[src$="slide-1-outcomes.jpg']).attr('src','/images/slide-2-benefits.jpg');
[06:55:05] <salientKnight> thank you! Cork++
[06:57:36] <devmikey> Cork: The only thing that doesn't work is the timeout: http://www.pastebin.com/ejhne3ks
[06:58:08] <nFFF> Guys does anyone know a resource of a list of really cool jquery plugins?

[06:59:04] <salientKnight> not working
[06:59:09] <Hawkee> if anybody wants to do @mentions like on Facebook
[06:59:14] <nFFF> Flo0815, no developer has made a list etc
[06:59:19] <nFFF> just been googling for 30 minutes
[06:59:23] <Cork> devmikey: http://www.pastebin.com/eJhne3ks <-- its empty
[06:59:42] <nFFF> my flatmate works at a digital agency, and they know all the cool plugins
[06:59:45] <devmikey> http://pastebin.com/eJhne3ks is not empty for me

[07:00:04] <nFFF> just a resource of popular ones for future projects
[07:00:31] <Flo0815> i don't think there is such list
[07:00:53] <nFFF> No problem, Ill get it off my flatmate when hes back, his company has one in house
[07:01:28] <Cork> devmikey: setTimeout isn't a jquery function
[07:01:42] <Flo0815> nFFF: u could send me it
[07:01:48] <devmikey> I know
[07:01:49] <Cork> devmikey: it takes a function and calls it after x number of miliseconds
[07:01:55] <nFFF> Im thinking of actually making a site for them
[07:01:59] <Flo0815> or publish it, so you'd be the first writing such a list :)
[07:02:02] <Cork> you can't run .fadeIn on it
[07:02:09] <ajpiano> nFFF: http://jquerylist.com/ http://jquerystyle.com/
[07:02:11] <Cork> sorry Out

[07:07:07] <Innocentus> hi
[07:07:07] <nFFF> http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/parallax/ pretty fuarking cool plugin
[07:07:08] <devmikey> But thanks
[07:07:08] <Innocentus> anyone here?
[07:07:22] <Flo0815> Innocentus: no
[07:07:27] <Cork> ?ask
[07:07:27] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:07:48] <Innocentus> OK
[07:07:54] <Innocentus> I wanted to make a semantically nice slideshow
[07:07:54] <aqeel> hi room
[07:07:59] <Innocentus> so I used a list with LI-elements
[07:08:08] <Innocentus> but now the browser downloads all images at the same time
[07:08:12] <Innocentus> this is not so nice
[07:08:18] <Innocentus> how should I make a slideshow then?
[07:08:34] <Flo0815> Innocentus: trigger the download when the next item is clicked
[07:08:48] <Cork> aka, don't add all the images to dom on load
[07:08:50] <Flo0815> so just load the current image, the previous and the next
[07:09:14] <aqeel> trigger the download of all images but keep it hidden and show as required and when needed
[07:09:15] <Flo0815> and if the user clicks to see the next picture, load the nextnext picture via ajax
[07:09:38] <Flo0815> aqeel: that doesn't solve the huge inital download
[07:09:51] <Flo0815> ah sry
[07:09:54] <Flo0815> misunndertsood
[07:10:22] <Cork> Flo0815: no i think you where right on
[07:10:23] <Innocentus> so I can't use the image-elements at all?
[07:10:35] <Innocentus> but this is unsemantic, isn't it?
[07:10:36] <Cork> Innocentus: only for the first element
[07:10:51] <Flo0815> Innocentus: what u mean by semantic?
[07:10:54] <Cork> Innocentus: well when the image is added to the page it triggers a load
[07:10:57] <Flo0815> or unsemantic
[07:11:24] <Innocentus> I want to use an html structure to which then is added functionality by javascript/jquery
[07:11:33] <salientKnight> hey all
[07:11:44] <Innocentus> I can't control the download order of images?
[07:11:50] <Flo0815> sure u can
[07:11:51] <Cork> Innocentus: no
[07:11:54] <Flo0815> ?
[07:11:56] <Innocentus> Can I supress the download of image elements?
[07:12:02] <Cork> only by not adding them do dom
[07:12:28] <Cork> as soon as you attach an img element to dom it tries to download its src url
[07:12:38] <salientKnight> Cork, I got that code to work but the lame backend code is using the same image for the thumb as for the main image, is there a way to specify only the second instance of that image?
[07:13:04] <Cork> salientKnight: second instance?
[07:13:26] <salientKnight> slide-1-outcomes.jpg is being used twice
[07:13:34] <salientKnight> so that code you helped me with changes both
[07:13:39] <Cork> ah
[07:13:51] <salientKnight> I just need to change the second instance
[07:13:56] <Cork> salientKnight: :eq(1)
[07:14:07] <salientKnight> thanks you rock
[07:14:10] <salientKnight> Cork++
[07:14:11] <Cork> np
[07:15:41] <Flo0815> Coark: eq selects the elements in the order in dom?
[07:15:52] <aqeel> ok room if i wrap aound an element why does it loose all its attached property
[07:16:18] <Flo0815> Cork: eq selects the elements in the order they are added in dom?
[07:16:21] <aqeel> after wrapping hover will not act as was when not being wraped
[07:17:04] <aqeel> i thought wrap was container outside and not inside....
[07:17:52] <kryl> hi, I try to enable jscroll-pane in impromptu plugin :-) can u help me please ?
[07:18:10] <Flo0815> kryl: whats ur problem
[07:20:06] <mattyh88> I'm using delegate for the moment because i'm using jquery 1.4.2 (it's an old project) but it's not working. I have it like this atm: $('.new_costitems').delegate(".cost_per_unit", "change", function(){}); This should add the change event for all current and newly added elements right?
[07:20:33] <Flo0815> if u cant use on, use .live()
[07:21:45] <kryl> Flo0815, jscrollpane work on div with class .scroll-pane, and impromptu is an other modal plugin. I try to understand how to enable jscrollpane in impromptu modal ?

[07:45:20] <improwizacja> Deiu
[07:45:22] <RyanD> any help with that?
[07:45:23] <Deiu> Can someone please tell me how I can pass an URI containing the hash sign (#) during an $(element).load() call?
[07:45:31] <RyanD> oh my.
[07:45:32] <RyanD> disregard.
[07:45:44] <Deiu> Damn.
[07:45:59] <improwizacja> ajax
[07:46:08] <Deiu> I tried to encodeURI() but it doesn't work
[07:46:14] <RyanD> http://pastebin.com/q4BrxemV
[07:46:15] <RyanD> ^^
[07:46:54] <improwizacja> Deiu if now whan help you i help you leter
[07:46:55] <RyanD> any help on this, what I'm trying to do is iterate between all of the items with the class lego20_n181_navigation_blocksets_subnavitem_li_a, and if their text is equal to thisPage, change the class.
[07:52:56] <Innocentus> aqeel / DaveJ|UK: and I can use them also in commercial projects?
[07:53:15] <Deiu> improwizacja, any ideas?
[07:54:12] <Deiu> This is what I'm trying to do: $(element).load("script.php?uri="+encodeURI(uri));
[07:54:12] <Flo0815> not really a jquery thing but there is a problem with css selectors: http://jsfiddle.net/yGpJk/6/ why isn't the first textblock displayed like in css given?
[07:54:29] <anli_> Can I cancel form submission in a <button>:s click event handler without accessing the form tag and using onsubmit in that form tag?
[07:54:46] <Deiu> But it won't pass the anchor values (what comes after #)
[07:54:51] <covi> Hi all. I want to make a simple website that contains several "slides", between which the visitor can press '<-' and '->' to navigate. Each slide can has some text and some pics. Can I achieve this by using html+jquery? If so, can you point out some starting points? Thanks.
[07:55:03] <Flo0815> anli_: on('submit', function(){return false;'});
[07:55:22] <anli_> Whats on?
[07:55:31] <Flo0815> anli_: $('form').on('submit', function(){return false;'});
[07:55:36] <the_hack> Can anyone advise why jquery-us sortable is not working for firefox?  http://pastie.org/3648154
[07:55:39] <anli_> Thats accessing the form tag
[07:55:41] <Flo0815> it catches the event "submit"
[07:55:48] <anli_> I want this to operate on button level
[07:56:00] <anli_> Just cancelling a button press
[07:56:12] <anli_> That cant be rocket science, can it :)
[07:56:20] <Flo0815> $('button').on('click', function(){return false;});
[07:56:34] <anli_> I did also guess thats a solution
[07:57:31] <Innocentus> There is a plugin / effect which name I would like to know
[07:57:42] <Innocentus> when you scroll down a page, the images are fading in
[07:57:49] <Innocentus> how is that called?
[07:57:55] <RyanD> alright, got it more figured out
[07:58:00] <RyanD> basically, how do I do an each on a class name?
[07:58:24] <RyanD> IE, if I do $('lego20_n181_navigation_blocksets_subnavitem_li_a').each(function() { it breaks, but if I do $('a').each it works just fine.
[07:58:47] <the_hack> covi: here's one https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js
[07:59:24] <Cork> RyanD: you mean "lego20_n181_navigation_blocksets_subnavitem_li_a" is your class name?
[07:59:30] <RyanD> yes
[07:59:40] <Cork> then you need to add a dot infront of it
[07:59:49] <Cork> ".lego20_n181_navigation_blocksets_subnavitem_li_a"
[07:59:52] <RyanD> done :). thanks.
[07:59:53] <Cork> think css
[08:00:05] <Flo0815> not really a jquery thing but there is a problem with css selectors: http://jsfiddle.net/yGpJk/6/ why isn't the first textblock displayed like in css given?
[08:00:23] <Deiu> Is there no way to have $(element).load("feeds.php?uri=http://localtion.com/#feed1");? (to be able to pass the # sign in the uri)
[08:00:31] <RyanD> thanks a ton!
[08:00:35] <Gaia> <Gaia> Hey guys, anyone ever used caroufredSel ?
[08:02:27] <covi> the_hack: ty, but it is very very slow in my firefox... I don't want any fancy 3D effects, simple 2D will suffice. Any recommendation on what parts of documentation I should start from?
[08:02:49] <Cork> Flo0815: first-child works on elements not classes
[08:03:03] <Flo0815> Cork: :(
[08:03:12] <Flo0815> workaround?
[08:04:25] <infid> they should have called it first-born
[08:05:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/yGpJk/7/
[08:05:49] <the_hack> covi: here's a great one I've used. it's a rubygem
[08:05:55] <the_hack> covi: https://github.com/schacon/showoff
[08:06:21] <Cork> Flo0815: alternativly http://jsfiddle.net/yGpJk/9/
[08:06:51] <Flo0815> Cork: thx alot :)
[08:06:59] <Cork> np
[08:07:38] <covi> the_hack: well. I mean how can I implement a simple one by myself?
[08:11:21] <djQuery> anyone got any tuts on using on inside of a plugin?
[08:11:42] <the_hack> Can anyone advise why jquery-us sortable is not working for firefox?  http://pastie.org/3648154
[08:20:13] <anli_> Seems that solution explorer shows a myriad of "script block" items when I run a script, can I avoid that?
[08:20:31] <Innocentus_> sry
[08:20:36] <Innocentus_> There is a plugin / effect which name I would like to know
[08:20:37] <Innocentus_> when you scroll down a page, the images are fading in
[08:20:41] <Innocentus_> how is that called?
[08:21:47] <faraway> Innocentus: i think lazy loading
[08:22:24] <Innocentus> faraway: what happens if the user has disabled javascript? will he still see the images - or not?
[08:23:56] <anli_> The idea of having solution explorer expand nodes when I am debugging my asp.net project seems corny
[08:23:56] <faraway> Innocentus: i'm not sure the last time i have looked at this was that either the image where not loaded when js was of, or there where "ugly" no script constructs. or the images have still been loaded. but i think the plugins got better, but as i saved, i haves looked at this for a long time
[08:24:27] <djQuery> Innocentus, depends on how they are being hidden, shown. are they truly being lazy loaded? or only initialy hidden andthen shown as you scroll.
[08:24:28] <faraway> Innocentus: .. as i said ...
[08:24:29] <Innocentus> faraway: oh thank you, you just brought me to the noscript tag
[08:24:33] <Innocentus> this will work
[08:24:34] <Innocentus> yes
[08:24:36] <Innocentus> hurra
[08:24:46] <Innocentus> so I just wrap the image tags with noscript tags
[08:25:15] <Innocentus> and a jquery will take the noscript tags (with the containing image tags) out and loads them in correct order (the images are in a ul list)
[08:25:17] <Innocentus> this is great
[08:25:32] <Xotix> hi
[08:25:53] <anli_> I really like <asp:TextBox CssClass="ckeditor" ...
[08:28:20] <faraway> Innocentus: do you know if the content of noscript is always readable by js ?
[08:30:50] <Innocentus> faraway: I think so, or isn't it?
[08:30:52] <Innocentus> faraway: oh
[08:30:56] <ribot> hi
[08:31:12] <Xotix> i got some html. i want to get all src paths and make a json out of it. -> http://pastebin.com/KgP61uhM I'm getting for each img an 404, how can i get rid of this also i get Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
[08:32:13] <faraway> Innocentus: i'm not sure about. that's why i'm asking ;)
[08:32:25] <Innocentus> ok
[08:33:55] <Innocentus> you are right, damn
[08:34:00] <Innocentus> some kind of hack has to be used
[08:35:18] <Innocentus> but wait, this plugin also uses noscript as fallback: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[08:35:37] <Innocentus> the question is, if a browser with javascript enabled will parse noscript-elements
[08:36:31] <ribot> i have a function within a function, and want to access the outer functions variables as shown here: http://pastebin.com/gS6h9Hg2 -- how can i do that?
[08:38:28] <faraway> Innocentus: yeah â€¦ but this is the "ugly" version i also have seen. where you need a noscript for every image
[08:39:08] <anli_> That "script block" spam I get in vs, is it avoidable?
[08:41:04] <Innocentus> faraway: but when it is generated on server-side, this would be ok, right?
[08:42:58] <faraway> Innocentus: sure â€¦ it will work, but i don't like it much :D
[08:43:07] <s34n_> I want to set the focus on a particular control when a dialog opens. I have initialized the dialog with a handler for the open event.
[08:43:24] <s34n_> But focus isn't getting set
[08:43:41] <Innocentus> yes, they should implement some download control
[08:44:50] <s34n_> the handler is getting triggered, but the control isn't actually displayed when the trigger fires.
[08:45:07] <s34n_> does that matter?
[08:46:05] <djQuery> is there a way to use ui-icons-trash for example for the bullet of an li?
[08:46:27] <Zzaichik> autofocus? html5 awesomeness
[08:46:53] <kaolti> hey everyone
[08:47:58] <Innocentus> Please recommend a simple, nice and good, popular, free div-zoom jquery plugin to me
[08:48:02] <the_hack> correction "jquery-ui'
[08:48:05] <Innocentus> there are many zoom plugins
[08:48:14] <kaolti> I have a string and I'm trying to cut from it the part from the start to the penultimate occuring / character
[08:48:18] <kaolti> anyone knows how can I do this?
[08:48:34] <_dave_h_d> does anyone know how to prevent jq touch from crashing web browser with lists with lists bigger than 150
[08:48:40] <_dave_h_d> ours always crashes
[08:48:45] <_dave_h_d> when the list gets big
[08:49:08] <s34n_> Zzaichik: autofocus doesn't work
[08:50:07] <Innocentus> anyone? :(
[08:52:33] <Zzaichik> s34n_:  it should work in everything except IE
[08:52:55] <s34n_> kaolti: regex
[08:53:44] <Zzaichik> you could check if the desired input field has autofocus and if not, apply .focus()
[08:53:53] <Zzaichik> I don't know what's been covered, I just got in here. :)
[08:53:57] <s34n_> Zzaichik: the input is getting added to a div with an ajax load
[08:54:16] <s34n_> that div is already an initialized jqueryui dialog
[08:54:45] <Zzaichik> oh okay, I gotchya. hmmm
[08:54:51] <s34n_> when the dialog is dialog("open")'ed, I want the input to get focus
[08:55:06] <Zzaichik> and .focus() isn't working
[08:55:35] <s34n_> So I apply .focus() to the input during an open event handler for the dialog
[08:55:39] <s34n_> but it doesn't work
[08:55:47] <Zzaichik> so I'm thinking you'd have to .delegate() that event or use .on()
[08:56:21] <s34n_> the even handler fires off just fine
[08:56:34] <s34n_> s/even/event/
[08:56:40] <Zzaichik> but it doesn't actually get applied huh?
[08:56:44] <s34n_> right
[08:57:07] <s34n_> the dialog is not actually displayed on screen at the time the handler fires off
[08:57:09] <anli_> hm, mobiscroll does not understand esc
[08:57:45] <Zzaichik> So by the time the dialog has been displayed, the focus has been turned to something else.
[08:57:46] <s34n_> kaolti: are you familiar with regex?
[08:58:12] <kaolti> s34n_ I know what it is but no idea how to use it :D
[08:58:18] <s34n_> I put the event handler on dialog focus event, but same thing
[08:59:29] <Zzaichik> I still think .delegate() might be the solution. But hard to say. Can you create a working example or something? jsfiddle.com it up
[08:59:43] <s34n_> kaolti: http://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+regex+replace&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[09:00:04] * s34n_ blushes
[09:00:19] <s34n_> sorry about the extra junk on that query string
[09:00:32] <kaolti> s34n_, np, thanks for the link
[09:01:07] <Zzaichik> s34n_:  obviously the problem is, the focus event is firing too early. So by the time the div is shown, the focus is no longer where you want it. It's doing what it's supposed to, just not when you want it to.
[09:01:43] <Zzaichik> But I'd have to see what's going on at this point to offer constructive feedback
[09:02:10] <faraway> Innocentus: div zoom
[09:02:14] <faraway> Innocentus: ?
[09:03:02] <Innocentus> faraway: a div is not visible and then it appear by becoming greater and greater
[09:03:04] <Innocentus> hm
[09:03:28] <Innocentus> And should I encapsulate everything into jquery plugins? What is with the code for using and configuring other plugins?
[09:04:03] <ribot> i have a function within a function, and want to access the outer functions variables as shown here: http://pastebin.com/gS6h9Hg2 -- how can i do that?
[09:05:30] <kibble> ribot: pass them in?
[09:06:24] <ribot> kibble: how?
[09:07:04] <kibble> function(data, email, some_id)?
[09:07:32] <faraway> Innocentus: i think there are some that use css3 for that but for older browsers i don't know if there is something that zooms the content
[09:07:36] <kibble> or you should be, but I've never tested it, declare the variables inside the parent function and be able to access them inside the child
[09:08:09] <Innocentus> faraway: but why is css responsible for animations?
[09:08:59] <kibble> ribot: declaring them outside a function makes them 'global' so in theory "var email = 'foo';" should work in the parent function then you can access them in the child
[09:09:49] <s34n_> Zzaichik: I got it. It was the "show" effect that was killing it
[09:10:09] <Zzaichik> ah - cool. I'm glad you got it.
[09:10:43] <faraway> Innocentus: cause css controls the look of the page ;) if you change font size, color, position, â€¦ with query, it set's the corresponding style attributes. and transforms are features of css3. you could emulate this with chaining the font size will not alway look good
[09:11:06] <ribot> kibble so declaring them with var in the outer function makes them accessible in the inner function?
[09:11:24] <kibble> ribot: it should, would take 2 seconds to test
[09:11:56] <s34n_> it would be nice to have some after-effect event
[09:12:39] <ribot> kibble it works, thanks
[09:12:40] <Innocentus> ok
[09:12:54] <ribot> though "passing" them does not work, as it gives them jquery set values
[09:13:10] <s34n_> When you call effects directly they can have callbacks, which is cool
[09:13:43] <s34n_> when you set an effect for a dialog using the "show" option, how do you set a callback for that effect?
[09:16:32] <faraway> Innocentus: probably this will be sufficient for you http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Scale
[09:16:56] <s34n_> show takes an object, so perhaps that's my answer
[09:20:26] <s34n_> does anybody know that structure of the object for the show option of .dialog()?
[09:20:28] <Innocentus> faraway: ok, now there is an image in its original size - now it should be zoomed
[09:20:42] <Innocentus> faraway: for this there is a version of image with greater resolution
[09:21:03] <Innocentus> faraway: currently I try to download the image with more resolution and lay it over the small image
[09:21:11] <Innocentus> faraway: and then the scale effect is started
[09:21:29] <Innocentus> faraway: is this a good idea? are there already plugins for this?
[09:21:54] <boart> ciao
[09:21:57] <Innocentus> faraway: and another thing - there is jquery-javascript for a page - should all the code be stuffed inside a jquery-plugin or is this nonsense?
[09:22:46] <boart> #FUTURA
[09:22:58] <faraway> Innocentus: about the image, sorry, tats something you need to find out yourself, either finding a plugin, or do it yourself or find someone els that could help you
[09:23:36] <faraway> Innocentus: about code structuring, if you need to apply some behavior on certain elements often it makes sense to create a plugin.
[09:23:56] <tehOPEologist> sup all
[09:24:25] <Innocentus> faraway: where should the page-code go?
[09:25:35] <Deele> I need a little help concerning about creation of html elements in jquery
[09:26:28] <Deele> for example, I want to make a "New row" button, that will add to the end my table a new row, same as last one
[09:26:43] <faraway> Innocentus: in js file that you load in the head ?!
[09:27:14] <Innocentus> faraway: currently I put into a script element in head-element :/
[09:27:18] <tehOPEologist> was wondering if someone knew if i could change text into an image when someone clicks on the text/link, and revert back to the text/link again if they click it again..  anyone know if that's possible with jquery?  or am i thinking of another language that can do that..
[09:28:58] <tehOPEologist> nobody?
[09:29:00] <tehOPEologist> =/
[09:29:27] <Kre10s> I have cloned a table, call it $cloned. if I $table.find('td').each(index){ ... }); can I given index find the corresponding td in $cloned?
[09:29:36] <faraway> Innocentus: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[09:30:06] <Poetro_> tehOPEologist: use toggle and set up two functions. One would save the text to a variable and replace the text with the image
[09:30:24] <Poetro_> tehOPEologist: and the other would restore the text from the variable
[09:30:36] <tehOPEologist> hm, good idea..  don't know why i didn't think of toggle, i've used it before >_<  haha
[09:30:43] <tehOPEologist> fantastic, thanks man :D
[09:30:54] <tehOPEologist> i'll keep you posted as i work on it if i run into any complications
[09:40:21] <pen> I wonder
[09:40:39] <pen> if $.ajax has success callbacks would deferred methods still works on it?
[09:42:42] <Larholm> $.ajax(..).success(…).error(...)
[09:43:16] <pen> Larholm: but I have success in the opts, but I also want to chain other ajax to the same server.
[09:43:31] <pen> the callbacks are in difference context
[09:43:37] <pen> different
[09:44:00] <ajpiano> pen: both callbacks will work
[09:44:13] <pen> so $.ajax(..success: function() {}, ...).done($.ajax(...success: function() {}, ...))
[09:45:18] <ajpiano> .done(function() { $.ajax(options);  });
[09:46:25] <devmikey> Cork: u still here?
[09:46:36] <pen> ajpiano: and seems like done is called before the ajax before is finished
[09:46:52] <ajpiano> pen, if you were using the syntax you pasted above, indeed that would happen
[09:46:59] <andrew9183> hey guys, if i call a refreshIframe function that basically refreshes the same page, how can I attach an event that fires when the iframe has finished loading?  ie $(iframe).load
[09:47:05] <pen> ajpiano: why?
[09:47:07] <ajpiano> because you would be executing the ajax right away
[09:47:26] <ajpiano> pen because you are executing the function right away, passing the return value of $.ajax as the "callback" for .done
[09:47:35] <ajpiano> that's why you need .done(function() { $.ajax(options); })
[09:47:39] <pen> ajpiano: so I should be wrapping with an anonymous function?
[09:47:50] <ajpiano> yes
[09:47:54] <pen> I see
[09:51:36] <smares> cheers
[09:51:47] <smares> can anyone explain to me why the following does not work...
[09:52:04] <smares> setTimeout($('
[09:52:06] <smares> oops
[09:52:21] <tronhammer> setTimeout should receive a function
[09:52:27] <smares> yeah!
[09:52:28] <smares> I said oops!
[09:52:29] <smares> :P
[09:52:30] <pen> ajpiano: thanks. seems like it is working now. And with the magic of coffeescript my code look so cooler than ever
[09:52:40] <smares> setTimeout($('#MyForm').submit, 5000)
[09:52:55] <adac> I do have an action listener defined like: $("#new-property").change(function() { ... now I want this only to fire "on selection" AND "if page is not initially loaded". Is there a way to do that?
[09:52:58] <andrew9183> $("iframe").one($(this).load(), scrollToAttr("[data=\""+data.section+"\"]"));
[09:53:05] <andrew9183> does this make sense? or is it fundamentally flawed
[09:53:19] <tronhammer> try  $("#MyForm").get(0).submit
[09:53:58] <smares> what works however is...
[09:54:22] <smares> setTimeout(function() { $('#MyForm').submit(); }, 5000)
[09:54:29] <smares> or
[09:55:02] <smares> setTimeout("jQuery('#MyForm').submit()", 5000)
[09:56:22] <ajpiano> andrew9183: it's fundamentally flawed
[09:56:31] <andrew9183> oops it was one('load',function())
[09:56:34] <ajpiano> andrew9183: i think you're looking for $("#iframe").one("load", function() {});
[09:56:35] <ajpiano> yep
[09:56:38] <andrew9183> thanks aj
[10:00:26] <tronhammer> smares:  looking at it a bit, it looks like the function $("#MyForm").submit isn't native code, and does evaluations on the parameters.  My best guess is that since setTimeout won't send it the correct parameters, it looks like it won't trigger the expected event.
[10:00:57] <smares> ok, I see
[10:01:09] <smares> what I get is a jQuery exception that this.on is null or something
[10:02:40] <ajpiano> smares: i'm pretty sure that when you do setTimeout( $("foo").submit, 5000 ), the handler doesn't get invoked in the proper scope
[10:02:57] <ajpiano> smares: it's similar to what happens when you do var method = someobj.othermethod;
[10:03:01] <ajpiano> and then method()
[10:03:07] <ajpiano> doesn't get run in the context of someobj
[10:03:30] <smares> apropos, does jQuery have something like prototype's bind?
[10:04:31] <esiegel> Hello everyone, quick question about offsetting things: I'm using .offset().top, but I'd like to go above the top, just 20 or 30 pixels.
[10:04:46] <thang> -20?
[10:05:40] <esiegel> Sure, but how would I format that? .offset(-20).top
[10:07:46] <ajpiano> smares: yes, see ?proxy
[10:07:47] <bot-t> smares, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[10:08:13] <smares> thanks!
[10:08:49] <Poetro> esiegel: offset = $(el).offset; $(el).offset({left: offset.left, top: offset.top - 20});
[10:09:10] <esiegel> So offset it, then offset it again, so to speak?
[10:09:24] <Poetro> esiegel: offset is a getter / setter function
[10:09:35] <Poetro> first we use it as a getter, then as a setter
[10:09:45] <esiegel> Okay, I think I get it.
[10:09:46] <Poetro> u cannot use it in both sense at the same time
[10:09:56] <esiegel> That makes sense. Thanks.
[10:10:23] <Poetro> esiegel: typo offset = $(el).offset();
[10:10:42] <esiegel> Poetro: right, got that. Thanks!
[10:16:53] <andrew9183> i have to admit, i'm still a bad coder, but i am much better than i was 2 months ago !
[10:18:17] <Krinkle-away> andrew9183: Good to hear :) May there be many more moments like that!
[10:20:04] <s34n_> does anybody know how the "show" option of dialog() works when you pass it an object?
[10:20:07] <shawn_dones> Are there any drawbacks to LazyLoading?
[10:21:04] <kibble> andrew9183: I just keep adding brackets and curly braces until firebug stops complaining
[10:21:10] <Poetro> :D
[10:22:14] <jedimind> shawn_dones, only if you dont have a fallback
[10:22:25] <shawn_dones> jedimind: thx
[10:27:26] <pen> is there any event to bind to input elements to know when they are changed?
[10:27:34] <Innocentus> QUESTION: Do I also have to wrap the code of external js for a page in $(document).ready(function(){ }); `?
[10:28:59] <supsup> Innocentus:  depends on where the script tag is at in HTML, and what it targets.
[10:29:24] <stalecache> i'm afraid of browser issues with navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() ... are there any good wrapper libraries for geolocation? Saw jquery-geolocation on google code, but it was created in 2009, not sure if it's any good anymore.
[10:29:27] <kibble> pen: keyup keydown usually are the standard, but it depends upon on what kind of input it is
[10:29:44] <Poetro> stafamus: what are u afraid of?
[10:29:45] <pen> kibble: I'm using .on 'keyup' but it doesn't work
[10:30:08] <Poetro> pen: define doesnt work
[10:30:10] <pen> kibble: for $(':input')
[10:30:25] <stafamus> Poetro: ??
[10:30:33] <pen> Poetro: meaning the callback is not called when I change some input box in the page
[10:30:56] <stalecache> Poetro, me? afraid of the detection support for old browsers... javascript errors rendering my page useless.. etc
[10:31:14] <Poetro> stafamus: just check if the variables do exist
[10:31:34] <pen> Poetro: and how do I know if the callback is not called? because I have a console.log in there
[10:31:48] <Poetro> stalecache: if (navigator.geolocation) {...}
[10:32:21] <stalecache> Poetro, i feel safer when new native javascript functionality is wrapped in a nice comfy graceful degradation wrapper
[10:32:58] <stalecache> Poetro, yea, that's what i would start with
[10:35:17] <devmikey> Please take a look at pastebin.com/43xLGnen
[10:35:36] <devmikey> Why are the images sticky when fading back in
[10:35:42] <stafamus> Poetro: ??
[10:36:18] <devmikey> meaning, why do they not switch *before* fading back in?
[10:36:29] <Poetro> stafamus: sry, it was meant for stalecache
[10:36:38] <Poetro> stupid autocomplet
[10:37:10] <pen> yea, on is messed up. live pwns
[10:37:46] <supsup> devmikey maybe because your times are too close try moving inner timeout to 20000 instead  -- should make jsfiddle prob
[10:42:43] <devmikey> supsup: I don't think so
[10:43:02] <VictorCl> if((temporal_candidats.candidate[object_index].ge.city != undefined))   ==  temporal_candidats.candidate[object_index].ge.city is undefined
[10:43:14] <VictorCl> how can I avoid it giving me an undefined error?
[10:43:16] <supsup> yah don't know gotta roll to meeting maybe i'll try to make jsfiddle afterwards
[10:44:33] <Poetro> VictorCl: check for the existence of the property
[10:44:44] <Innocentus> supsup: the script tags are inside the head-tag
[10:45:15] <Poetro> VictorCl: temporal_candidats && temporal_candidats.candidate && temporal_candidats.candidate[object_index] && temporal_candidats.candidate[object_index].ge.city
[10:45:26] <Innocentus> supsup: do the content of the script-files, the script-tags are referencing to, have to be surrounded by $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[10:45:39] <VictorCl> :/
[10:45:43] <VictorCl> isnt there a shorter way?
[10:45:58] <Poetro> VictorCl: maybe use CoffeeScript if u want to write shorter
[10:46:04] <Poetro> it will de the same for u ;)
[10:46:10] <kibble> Innocentus: usually the best idea because if the script is referencing an html element which isn't in the dom yet it will fail
[10:46:43] <Innocentus> thank you
[10:46:45] <Innocentus> so it is right
[10:47:31] <kibble> Innocentus: for example if I put in var foo = $('#tag').html(); but I don't put in <input id='foo' > until after the script the variable foo would be undefined, inside doc ready it doesn't matter when I put the script
[10:47:48] <Innocentus> [document]->[head]->[script-tag]->[script-file]->$(document).ready(function(){[script-file-contents]
[10:47:50] <Innocentus> is this right?
[10:48:31] <kibble> very few jquery things if any require them to be in the <head>.
[10:48:55] <kibble> Not sure if it's right but I've read convensions that say if you can always load jquery at the bottom of the page
[10:49:05] <safani> how would i delay a function from executing
[10:49:24] <kibble> the one expection of course is loading jquery.min.js before declaring your $( stuff
[10:51:47] <safani> when i try with $.delay there is no delay method
[10:52:00] <safani> is there a function that simply delays time
[10:52:17] <NoiseEee> i could use one for real life, if anyone knows please give me a heads up
[10:52:53] <kibble> safani: Timeout?
[10:53:25] <kibble> or rather settimeout()
[10:53:26] <JonathanNeal> Hello!
[10:54:27] <safani> yes!
[10:54:42] <safani> i found that like 2 sec later...and it worked
[10:55:30] <Innocentus> kibble: but doesn't dictate the html spec that the javascript files are loaded in head?
[10:55:56] <deathguppie> does anyone know how I can use an attibute value as a selector?
[10:56:12] <deathguppie> attribute
[10:57:18] <kibble> Innocentus: meh, if they aren't required until later in the page, IE until after the DOM is populated it doesn't matter when they are loaded.  Convention says, to me at least, the longer you want to load the js file the quicker the page appears to load because a browser does blocking while pulling in a <script> file
[10:57:30] <kibble> s/want/wait/
[10:57:49] <kibble> deathguppie: .attr
[10:57:59] <kibble> err sorry read the question wrong
[10:59:08] <deathguppie> I just want to do $('attribute value').whateverIWant()
[10:59:37] <eddiemonge> ?selectors @ deathguppie
[10:59:38] <bot-t> deathguppie, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/

[11:00:00] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[11:00:08] <deathguppie> or $(a hrefValue).dosomething()
[11:00:13] <deathguppie> that's closer
[11:01:28] <jrockjiggz> $('a[name=something]').
[11:01:56] <smares> new problem folks...
[11:02:08] <deathguppie> ok.. I had actually read that page..
[11:02:26] <smares> $('<form...>').appendTo('#Meh').delay(10000).submit()
[11:03:07] <smares> if I get the docu right, that should create a form element, append it to the element with ID Meh, wait 10 seconds and then submit
[11:03:32] <jrockjiggz> smares: yes, yes, not sure about delay, yes
[11:03:55] <smares> what it actually does is create the element, wait 10 seconds, appends it to the element and submits right away
[11:03:56] <jrockjiggz> looks good to me
[11:04:11] <sphinxxx> n3
[11:04:28] <sphinxxx> how can i prompt a file save from an ajax request?
[11:04:48] <jrockjiggz> file save?
[11:04:58] <sphinxxx> even if i have php return a type 'application/octet-stream'  , it only prompts the download if I go directly to the php page, but not through an ajax request to the php page
[11:05:28] <smares> is that even supposed to work?
[11:05:45] <kibble> sphinxxx: can't send binary data through ajax
[11:05:56] <sphinxxx> its not really binary
[11:06:01] <sphinxxx> its text/csv
[11:06:11] <kibble> it's still a file
[11:06:28] <kibble> the way I fixed that was to post the file to a hidden iframe
[11:06:36] <kibble> or not post, send
[11:07:04] <sphinxxx> this looks interesting: https://github.com/dcneiner/Downloadify
[11:07:20] <kibble> or with some kind of plugin but it likely some something similar
[11:07:26] <sphinxxx> perhaps store the response in a variable, and then use that to download the file?
[11:07:40] <sphinxxx> but won't work without flash, thats kind of bad
[11:08:46] <kibble> sphinxxx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3320609/download-pdf-file-from-a-string-using-jquery basically what I did
[11:09:21] <sphinxxx> will that work for csv files though
[11:09:34] <kibble> whatever type of file
[11:09:37] <jrockjiggz> sphinxxx: i see here a very simple way using window.location.href with preventDefault();  you would just change the location url via script: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1296085/download-file-using-jquery
[11:10:15] <kibble> jrockjiggz: that was my second choice
[11:11:07] <sphinxxx> jrockjiggz: yea, that works too, although in that case i have to store the files on the server
[11:11:11] <deathguppie> no.. read it again.. thats not it..
[11:11:21] <sphinxxx> really what I'm doing is just sending them back on the fly, not storing them
[11:11:37] <nitrospectide> how can I make this only select an "a" if it is a direct descendent? $("nav ul#nice-menu-1 > li.active-trail").find('a')
[11:11:51] <deathguppie> I want the to use the value of one element to use as the selector for another element
[11:11:58] <kibble> sphinxxx: doesn't matter if it's an actual file or a .php file so long as the header is set
[11:11:58] <deathguppie> maybe it's not possible
[11:12:23] <sphinxxx> kibble:  oh i get it now
[11:12:36] <jrockjiggz> smares: $('<form...>').appendTo('#Meh').delay(10000).queue(function(){ $(this).submit(); });
[11:14:26] <jrockjiggz> deathguppie: $('input[name=' + $('#elId').attr('name') + ']')

[11:15:49] <devmikey> Question: WHy is the delay() call here: pastebin.com/vKCZDjpQ an error?
[11:18:05] <Sutffness> devmikey what error do you get in console
[11:18:38] <devmikey> Sutffness: blah.delay( not a function
[11:18:47] <smares> thanks jrockjiggz!
[11:18:51] <Advocated> kibble, you around?
[11:18:56] <kibble> Advocated: nope
[11:19:24] <kibble> this channel is just so interesting I don't think I've got any work finished this entire week
[11:19:26] <devmikey> $(...).blah.delay is not a function
[11:20:04] <kibble> a shame my problem(s) are so inside baseball and not related to jquery
[11:20:04] <Advocated> nor me, i'm still batling with this bloody dialog thing.. you ever heard of this, im showing a div in a certain section as that example did yest, so that shows fine. I've therefore moved my dialog to that div, so it shows. Which it does, but only if duplicated dialogs exist.. ever heard of that>
[11:20:51] <kibble> Advocated: I'm not sure I know what you mean by duplicated dialog(s)
[11:20:52] <sphinxxx> can you make an ajax request target a new window?
[11:20:56] <sphinxxx> like you can on an <a> tag
[11:21:06] <Advocated> kibble, if i make an example would you mind having a look? plz
[11:21:23] <kibble> sphinxxx: that second link you were given said to use window.location.href
[11:22:04] <kibble> sphinxxx: never mind I read that wrong
[11:22:12] <kibble> Advocated: sure, no promises
[11:23:26] <kibble> sphinxxx: I don't think after it's open you can target the new window from within the old one
[11:23:28] <microhxo> For whatever reason if i execute this code: $('.LicenseUploadPopup').data('tWindow').center().open();  on document.ready it says $('.LicenseUploadPopup').data('tWindow') is undefined...  but if i dont execute it and instead click a button that calls a function that has that code, it works fine..... why is this?
[11:25:05] <Advocated> kibble, here is a working example; http://jsfiddle.net/cFUCF/  if you hover over the icons, see how it shows in the divs, thats working correctly.I know its back to front but ignore that, can you see that working firstly?
[11:25:30] <kibble> yup
[11:26:03] <kibble> nice looking dialog btw
[11:26:27] <tehOPEologist> why isn't my link changing its text when i click on it?
[11:26:39] <tehOPEologist> i'm using .text()
[11:26:47] <deathguppie> jrockjiggz: didn't realize how cool that was till I looked closer at it.. it's a nice bit of nesting.. I do like it ;)
[11:26:55] <microhxo> anyone?
[11:26:55] <tehOPEologist> and i have a click function that says when you click the link, the link should change its text...
[11:26:59] <devmikey> I have stumped you all
[11:26:59] <tehOPEologist> but it's not :(
[11:27:43] <Advocated> thanks :) took a while lol, this is the html code thats an exact replication of the jsfiddle: http://pastebin.com/0vZu8Le9  see line 20, thats where my dialogs are created, but if you look at line 134, thats where i want them.. so in theory the dialogs are in the divs.. but if i remove the top ones, the bottom ones don't show. Get me?
[11:27:53] <Advocated> losing my mind with whats going on
[11:28:32] <Sutffness> devmikey
[11:28:36] <Sutffness> I just tried your exact code
[11:28:44] <Sutffness> I only changed the timeout lengths and the image URL
[11:28:47] <Sutffness> No errors
[11:28:49] <Sutffness> http://jsfiddle.net/pvH95/
[11:29:35] <sphinxxx> kibble: that 2nd solution seems to work, although i can't get window.location.href  to accept GET url parameters
[11:29:41] <Sutffness> Is your jQuery at least version 1.4?
[11:30:38] <kibble> sphinxxx: it certainly should, just fiddle with it
[11:31:09] <kibble> Advocated: sorry man that looks like it would take too long to diagnose then I have time for right now because I'm almost done my project
[11:31:24] <Advocated> doh
[11:32:27] * Sutffness prods devmikey
[11:32:32] <kibble> it's taken me almost a week and I'm so close now that I should just finish it before I forget where I left off and have to almost start again tomorrow
[11:33:38] <kibble> I only jump in here once and a while when I need a chance to clear my head from all the variables or the rare question gets asked that I think I have an answer for
[11:34:32] <tehOPEologist> can someone please explain to me why the text of this link isn't changing to what i put in .text() after you click on the link?
[11:34:34] <tehOPEologist> http://www.coolshoesphotography.com/simsol2012/
[11:34:39] <kibble> now if you ask me some php I might have a better chance of helping, or even php+jquery
[11:34:47] <tehOPEologist> the dashboard login link is what i'm trying to change >_<
[11:35:47] <devmikey> Sutffness: hold on
[11:36:00] <devmikey> no
[11:36:03] <devmikey> 1.3.2
[11:37:50] <Munger> Hi. I am creting an item like so .... var p = $("<p/>")      In my css I have a named style .footnote  { ... }      How do I add that style to the item?  $(p).css( "footnote" ); does not seem to work
[11:39:56] <devmikey> that may have been it
[11:41:06] <kibble> tehOPEologist: where is the script code I don't see it in the page
[11:41:18] <tehOPEologist> preloaded.js
[11:41:36] <kibble> if I do $('a.login_register_link').html('bob'); from the console that works
[11:41:51] <tehOPEologist> yeah, i think i'm using the wrong thing
[11:41:55] <tehOPEologist> i'm using text instead of html
[11:41:56] <kibble> but stuff in that inside the click function doesn't work
[11:41:57] <tehOPEologist> i'm an idiot
[11:41:59] <tehOPEologist> i'm fiing it now
[11:41:59] <tehOPEologist> lol
[11:42:06] <kibble> I think text worked also
[11:42:23] <kibble> yeah both work from the console
[11:42:48] <tehOPEologist> hm
[11:42:51] <tehOPEologist> wtfook then?
[11:43:31] <kibble> I think it has something to do with the toggle?
[11:43:49] <kibble> or the slider
[11:44:40] <tehOPEologist> hm
[11:44:59] <tehOPEologist> i basically want to change the text so that when you click on the link toggle, it changes to "cancel login"
[11:45:01] <tehOPEologist> that's all
[11:45:01] <tehOPEologist> lol
[11:45:07] <Advocated> anyone got time to look at a jsfiddle example of something whereby my dialogs are displaying as they should be, but theres duplicate code, if i remove that duplicate code they don't work at all which makes no sense?
[11:45:26] <kibble> sure looks like it should work, when I run into that I start from something simple and build it up until it stops working
[11:45:58] <Advocated> kibble, was that response to me?
[11:46:58] <tehOPEologist> fucking rofl
[11:47:01] <tehOPEologist> it works now
[11:47:16] <tehOPEologist> i had to do the .text() AFTER the toggle class
[11:47:21] <tehOPEologist> SEMANTICS!
[11:47:21] <tehOPEologist> >_<
[11:47:49] <tehOPEologist> SO
[11:48:46] <kibble> tehOPEologist: I tried that too, never worked for me.  But I was doing it through js console so that's possibly not updating things
[11:48:54] <tehOPEologist> yeh
[11:49:17] <tehOPEologist> i need to do a toggle now that changes it back to dashboard login if you click the cancel login link
[11:50:25] <tehOPEologist> can't i just do .toggle.text('cancel login','dashboard login'); ?
[11:50:35] <tehOPEologist> i can chain toggle and text somehow, right?
[11:50:42] <Advocated> hmm ive removed all contents out of the 2 divs, and dialogs are still working, but if i remove the container div <div id="search_pt_dialog_form" title="Create new user" style="border:1px solid #009;"></div> then the dialogs won't load, even though that div is show below.  Does anyone know of a weird sort of process that a dialog must do before loading or something?
[11:54:16] <JoeyCadle> how do you unbind a $.live('click'); event?
[11:54:40] <Rushing> anyone here experienced video or audio elements affecting the $(window).load()?
[11:54:56] <Rushing> seems to only be happening in chrome for me, but it's like it waits for the whole video to load
[11:55:21] <rroelofs> JoeyCadle: .die()
[11:55:31] <rroelofs> or better on() and off()
[11:56:00] <Advocated> tehOPEologist, you should be able todo toggle().text() ?
[11:56:12] <rroelofs> Rushing: That is the behavior I'd expect.  use .ready() if you want your code to run sooner
[11:56:27] <tehOPEologist> Advocated, should that toggle be outside the click function i have?
[11:56:42] <Rushing> actually, looks like it's only when i include the ogg and webm source tags
[11:56:43] <rabbi1> how can i achieve the accordion here http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/gxnp6/ when the element to be hidden is not next to the link (heading) ?
[11:57:11] <Rushing> i get an error in the network tool saying it doesn't know how to parse those
[11:57:27] <Advocated> tehOPEologist, got ur code anywhere?
[11:57:40] <tehOPEologist> si
[11:57:54] <tehOPEologist> right now, this is what i have to make it work
[11:58:07] <rroelofs> ?cik @ Rushing
[11:58:07] <bot-t> Rushing, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[11:58:17] <tehOPEologist> Advocated, http://pastebin.com/g7qeWwwu
[11:58:31] <Rushing> hah, try 200 hours of code...
[11:58:33] <tehOPEologist> http://www.coolshoesphotography.com/simsol2012/
[11:58:37] <tehOPEologist> that's the site i'm working from
[11:58:46] <tehOPEologist> i'm doing the dashboard login container just under the header
[11:59:08] <rroelofs> but creating a test case will often make the problem obvious
[11:59:23] <rabbi1> how can i achieve the accordion here http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/gxnp6/ when the element to be hidden is not next to the link (heading) ?
[11:59:26] <phuff> So, I've been dealing with a bug in some qunit tests for a couple of days now.  and I finally grabbed the jquery source and through some debugging in and used the chrome debugger.
[11:59:39] <phuff> In the middle of an .anmiate() sequence, jquery has two separate copies of the same element
[11:59:52] <Advocated> tehOPEologist, how easy would it be to make a tiny example of what ur trying todo on jsfiddle?  i didn't see what you were previously trying todo, can you explain?
[11:59:54] <phuff> s/anmiate/animate
[11:59:54] <Rushing> indeed, this was just supposed to go live yesterday, so i was hoping for someone who'd dealt with it before.
[12:00:18] <Rushing> now i know it's related to trying to use the <source/> tags for the different formats...
[12:00:19] <Rushing> hm
[12:00:28] <tehOPEologist> i'm just trying to make a toggle that changes the a link text to and from dashboard login, and cancel login when you click on the link
[12:00:46] <tehOPEologist> so when you click on dashboard login, it increases the container's height, and changes the test of the link to cancel login
[12:01:11] <tehOPEologist> and when you click on it again, i want it to go back to dashboard login, but all it's doing right now is staying as cancel login, cuz there's no else conditional for it
[12:01:19] <tehOPEologist> but i'm wondering if it'd be easier to just do a text toggle
[12:01:39] <tehOPEologist> just never really chained 2 functions together like this before
[12:03:44] <Sutffness> devmikey
[12:07:07] <Advocated> tehOPEologist, just looking nw#
[12:09:11] <Rushing> rroelofs: thanks for your interest. FYI, i got it pegged. using alternate video formats (with <source/> tag) makes chrome want to preload all of them, but it can't. setting the video preload attribute to "none" did the trick
[12:12:41] <Advocated> tehOPEologist, maybe you can't then, i just did what you were on about;seperately http://jsfiddle.net/grKUS/
[12:13:02] <tehOPEologist> hm
[12:13:10] <tehOPEologist> one sec, work's making me do something else, then i'll look at the code
[12:13:20] <tehOPEologist> i think i just need to make a conditional statement for each click process
[12:13:32] <Advocated> well, that will toggle, but not in one command
[12:13:51] <rabbi1> how can i achieve the accordion here http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/gxnp6/ when the element to be hidden is not next to the link (heading) ?

[12:15:12] <microhxo> How can i call a function on success of $ajax with the data?   success: myfunction(data) doesn't pass the data to the function?
[12:15:16] <tehOPEologist> Advocated, i got it!
[12:15:18] <tehOPEologist> just used$(this).text(  $(this).text() == 'Dashboard Login' ? 'Cancel Login' : 'Dashboard Login');
[12:15:30] <tehOPEologist> right after my container function inside the click function and it worked!
[12:15:31] <tehOPEologist> ^_^
[12:15:38] <tehOPEologist> thank you so much man, that shit was driving me NUTS >_<
[12:16:06] <eddiemonge> microhxo: yourFunction(data) { //stuff };  $.ajax({ success: yourFunction })
[12:16:28] <microhxo> thanks
[12:17:02] <Advocated> tehOPEologist, no problems :)
[12:19:10] <tehOPEologist> <3333333333333  would get help from again 5/5
[12:19:12] <tehOPEologist> haha :D
[12:19:31] <rabbi1> how can i add accordion for not a next immediate element ?
[12:20:27] <rroelofs> Rushing: Thanks for the info on video loading.

[12:31:13] <Kre10s> how can I combine two cloned elements. that is clone two elements and append them to each other?
[12:31:25] <eddiemonge> append them to each other?
[12:31:46] <eddiemonge> or add them a jquery collection so you can do things to both at once?
[12:33:41] <Kre10s> I want to do foo = "<div>a</div>"+"<div>b</div>"+"<div>c</div>" where a b and c dives are cloned elements. then i want to do foo.appendTo('body');
[12:37:13] <eddiemonge> Kre10s: $('div.a, div.b, div.c').clone().appendTo('body')
[12:37:25] <eddiemonge> or however you are selecting the divs
[12:43:31] <Advocated> ive come to the conclusion that i hate jquery dialogs, more than something i hate a lot. bloody things
[12:43:50] <Advocated> they work fine as standard, but try and position it somewhere specific and bang, you're super fooked
[12:45:59] <LarsD> Heyho
[12:47:46] <LarsD> How to check if a value from a form is smaller or even the value within a <td>-tag? :)
[12:48:04] <LarsD> atm I'm using this: if($(this).children('.search_text')[0].innerHTML.match(re)
[12:48:21] <LarsD> but it only checks if it's there .. not if it's smaller or even a value ..
[12:55:59] <eddiemonge> LarsD: why not get the value with .text() and then compare that to the form field.val()?
[12:57:09] <LarsD> eddimonge: I'm a newbie .. So pls excuse me .. I have to search the .text()-function and study its usement :D
[12:59:09] <LarsD> eddimonge: That wouldn't work .. In the <td> are also things like the euro-sign ..
[12:59:27] <LarsD> eddimonge: The user just type the value, not the sign ..
[13:00:44] <eddiemonge> LarsD: put the value by itself in a span then
[13:02:17] <LarsD> eddimonge: okaaaay .. I'll try it ^^
[13:02:19] <Advocated> can you not remove the non-numeric characters at time of comparing?
[13:02:53] <LarsD> If you tell me how? :P
[13:03:00] <gagarine> hello for jquery 1.7 how can I overwrite attr methode to make it compatible with property like in 1.6.1?
[13:03:32] <NoiseEee> gagarine: ?
[13:04:10] <gagarine> NoiseEee I want to replace the attr() by my function
[13:04:27] <Advocated> LarsD, $('#whatever').val().replace(/[^\d\WHATEVER]/g,""); where WHATEVER would be a decimal place if you wanted to keep that
[13:04:31] <gagarine> because now in 1.7 attr() doesn't support property... we have to use prop()
[13:04:41] <erichynds> gagarine: yes it does
[13:05:11] <LarsD> Advocated, okay, ill try ^^
[13:05:27] <gagarine> erichynds https://drupal.org/node/1448494
[13:05:31] <LarsD> and how may I check several values at the same time?
[13:05:33] <eddiemonge> gagarine: and whats wrong with using .attr for attributes and .prop for properties?
[13:05:55] <Advocated> LarsD, what do you mean?
[13:05:55] <gagarine> eddiemonge nothing wrong.. but I want to do a backward compatible function
[13:06:08] <gagarine> so drupal core and contrib doesn't have to adapt
[13:06:20] <gagarine> ... they will not anyway
[13:06:29] <LarsD> Avocated: if($(this).children('.search_text')[0].innerHTML.match(re))
[13:06:30] <Eviltwin> gagarine: What .attr did before was modify attributes in some cases and properties in others
[13:06:47] <eddiemonge> gagarine: so instead of fixing drupal, you want to hack jquery's core?
[13:06:48] <Eviltwin> gagarine: Which was bad because it meant if you actually wanted to change the other one, you were out of luck within jQuery
[13:06:49] <LarsD> Advocated: This checks one value .. How to change it to check 2?
[13:06:56] <gagarine> eddiemonge exactly
[13:07:10] <erichynds> gagarine: http://jsfiddle.net/B8KTA/
[13:07:13] <eddiemonge> gagarine: that is completely the wrong way to do it
[13:07:18] <Advocated> LarsD, what is it checking? explain what you're trying to do or puit an example on jsfiddle
[13:07:19] <erichynds> gagarine: that change was reverted in 1.6.something
[13:07:28] <eddiemonge> 1.6.1
[13:07:31] <erichynds> boolean attr changes also toggle props
[13:08:27] <eddiemonge> erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/B8KTA/1/ cc gagarine
[13:08:35] <LarsD> Advocated: checking = user types a value into form input field 1, then types another into field 2 and both values have to match into <tr> or the row will be hidden from screen ;)
[13:08:58] <LarsD> Advocated: I have to control 2 and more values if they are matching
[13:09:08] <Advocated> match into <tr> how do you mean? can you put a small example on jsfiddle?
[13:09:21] <LarsD> yeah, wait a moment ..
[13:12:09] <LarsD> Advocated: http://jsfiddle.net/SNwtp/1/
[13:12:46] <Advocated> LarsD, do you have the html to go with it?
[13:13:07] <LarsD> sure .. wait  :D
[13:14:46] <Eviltwin> gagarine: One way to patch .attr to work more like it used to would be to use attrHooks
[13:16:02] <gagarine> Eviltwin this is not a good way? http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1624-Ask-Ben-Overriding-Core-jQuery-Methods.htm
[13:16:48] <LarsD> Advocated: http://jsfiddle.net/SNwtp/2/
[13:17:04] <Eviltwin> Using attrHooks will let you modify the behavior of certain .attr's while leaving the others unaffected
[13:17:13] <Eviltwin> Using that method means you replace it entirely
[13:18:02] <ddilinger> what am i doing wrong with this statement?  $.map(["1", "2", "3"], parseInt);, expected result is [1,2,3], but i get [1, NaN, NaN] from chrome devtools
[13:18:06] <gagarine> Eviltwin ok I will dig into that
[13:18:24] <ddilinger> bah nevermind, $.map is sending too many arguments
[13:18:28] <Advocated> LarsD, // so when the user types in the input field, you want to check all rows with the class offer_item to see if there is a match to that current row, or all rows?
[13:19:15] <Eviltwin> ddilinger: Correct
[13:19:30] <Eviltwin> ddilinger: parseInt takes another arg for the base
[13:19:57] <Eviltwin> You're going to need to do $.map(["1", "2", "3"], function(v) { return parseInt(v); }); I think
[13:21:03] <the_hack> Can anyone advise why jquery-ui sortable is not working for firefox?  http://pastie.org/3648154
[13:21:25] <Eviltwin> the_hack: Can you make this a jsFiddle so we can see it in action instead of as a static paste?
[13:22:16] <the_hack> Eviltwin: yes
[13:22:38] <LarsD> Advocated: I want to show some offers within a table .. and if one <td> doesn't match all user-given values I want to hide it ..
[13:22:58] <LarsD> Advocated: it = the whole table
[13:23:25] <LarsD> therefor I'm using php while-loop ;) so I have an own table for every offer
[13:24:05] <Eviltwin> LarsD: Can you make a small, sample demo at jsFiddle.net?
[13:24:11] <Eviltwin> Include a small version of the table.
[13:24:42] <Advocated> LarsD, surely the each is checking each of the tds, i don't see the problem, may help if you add some test data to the table as we're working blind
[13:25:52] <FunnyLookinHat> What's the default easing on things like fadeIn ?  linear ?
[13:25:59] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:26:02] <LarsD> okay, but this will take several moments ^^
[13:26:05] <FunnyLookinHat> Cool
[13:36:41] <the_hack> Eviltwin: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/YmFga/1/
[13:37:02] <granville> when using parent().siblings('element') is therw a way to traverse down the tree to an element inside the selected sibling?
[13:37:03] <Eviltwin> You can't narrow this down to the specific issue any more?
[13:37:21] <Eviltwin> granville: Meaning what?
[13:38:15] <Eviltwin> the_hack: They slices seem to be dragging for me.
[13:38:18] <Eviltwin> What was the issue?
[13:38:59] <NoiseEee> granville: you mean find() ?
[13:39:01] <eddiemonge> the_hack: you need a space rel="9"alt
[13:39:10] <the_hack> Eviltwin: if you do it in Chrome, you can see how it is supposed to go.
[13:39:27] <granville> I have a fieldset with a legend that has a span with an a element.  a sibling to the legend is a div with a link in it.  I can get the legand with $('div_link).parent().siblings('legend') but I can't seem to dive into the legend to get to the a link.
[13:39:53] <the_hack> eddiemonge: ok i'll fix that.
[13:39:58] <Eviltwin> granville: see ?children or see ?find
[13:40:00] <bot-t> granville, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[13:40:00] <bot-t> granville, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[13:40:40] <eddiemonge> the_hack: also the #bar div above that needs a space as well between id and class
[13:41:47] <the_hack> edditmonge: ok I see one of the image links is broken, too - ill fix
[13:42:14] <granville> thanks very much, got the text I needed
[13:44:36] <the_hack> the white (empty) placeholder space should follow underneath the dragged item, so that when it is dropped, it goes into the spaceholder and the other items don't shift right. That happens in chrome, but not firefox.
[13:45:46] <granville> dang it.  It works in the console, but isn't working when I use $(this) for some reason and I know $(this) is getting the right dom element cause I can get the href from it.
[13:45:57] <the_hack> I've been looking at the code for hours and I don't know what I'm missing. The thing is, the demo on jQuery-ui's site does work correctly, even in firefox, so I _am_ missing something.
[13:46:31] <LarsD> Advocated, EvilTwin?
[13:47:05] <Eviltwin> LarsD: Where's the fiddle?
[13:47:18] <eddiemonge> the_hack: you need to add display: inline-block to those images
[13:47:59] <the_hack> edditmonge: ok
[13:49:35] <LarsD> Eviltwin, my testserver isn't working at the moment .. -.- may I send you a .zip or something like that?
[13:49:42] <Eviltwin> No you may not
[13:50:06] <LarsD> okay, how to show you 6 php/js files? :D
[13:50:20] <Eviltwin> I don't want to see any PHP files
[13:50:26] <Eviltwin> And learn to isolate your issues
[13:50:35] <eddiemonge> LarsD: perhaps if you cant provide a simple example, your "solution" may be overly complicated and perhaps not the best one?
[13:50:59] <the_hack> eddiemonge: that worked, but there's a new problem. when I pick up the image about half the time, it disappears, only to reappear when it's dropped.
[13:51:27] <the_hack> eddiemonge: maybe it's just a jsfiddle redraw issue?
[13:51:33] <LarsD> eddiemonge: I could show it to you, but I don't want to show my idea .. so I have to provide a copy and the ftp isn't working ..
[13:51:54] <the_hack> eddiemonge: I'll have to give it a test and see.
[13:51:56] <eddiemonge> the_hack: can you update your site?
[13:52:07] <eddiemonge> LarsD: you dont want to show your idea? why not?
[13:52:08] <the_hack> eddiemonge: doing it now.
[13:52:21] <Bish> i have written a jquery plugin with "methods", when i call these "methods" inside of the plugin its working fine, but if im using $('#plugindiv').PluginName('method'); it seems like "this" is not the same this as in creation, why?
[13:52:42] <Eviltwin> Bish: How did you implement your plugin?
[13:53:19] <Bish> (function($){methods = {...}; $.fn. = function(method) {...};})(jQuery);
[13:53:31] <LarsD> eddiemonge: anyone will be faster and gets my money .. :D
[13:53:39] <Eviltwin> Bish: How about you link your actual plugin
[13:53:41] <Bish> if(methods[method]) methods[method].apply(this,Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,1));		else methods.init.apply(this,arguments)
[13:53:50] <Eviltwin> Bish: How about you link your actual plugin
[13:53:58] <Bish> what does that mean?
[13:54:06] <Bish> oh, you mean, paste it?
[13:54:12] <Eviltwin> It means provide a URL at which there is the code that is your plugin
[13:54:28] <Bish> the code is preeetttty dirty
[13:54:46] <Eviltwin> Thought you wanted help debugging it
[13:54:48] <Bish> http://pastebin.com/rMf0s0Cu
[13:55:18] <LarsD> eddiemonge: I have to go now anyway .. Maybe you're here tomorrow? so I can show you then?
[13:55:34] <Eviltwin> Okay, do you know what "this" is at lines 93/94?
[13:55:57] <Bish> i GUESS it is the object.. which is selected by the selector
[13:56:14] <jaequery> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs   ,  i need to make it show a tab manually, and on their example they mention $('#myTab').tab('show');  but what does #myTab refer to? is that the id of the link menu or content ?
[13:56:24] <Eviltwin> Bish: When you do $("#foo") do you know what you get back?
[13:56:45] <Bish> well, a jquery object which handles the object with id foo
[13:57:13] <Eviltwin> It constructs a new jQuery object containing the elements that match the selector
[13:57:33] <LarsD> have a nice day! byee :)
[13:57:38] <Bish> yeah i know, and that is not equal to the "plugin" object? i remember that i did it once
[13:57:47] <Eviltwin> This means that if I do var a = $("#foo") and var b = $("#foo")
[13:57:56] <Eviltwin> Those are actually different objects
[13:58:12] <Bish> hm, but i did that once!
[13:59:06] <Eviltwin> Can you show me where you're using this and where it isn't working?
[13:59:55] <the_hack> eddiemonge: woohoo! Thanks! That did the trick beta.kidbuilder.net/puzzles/firefox/show
[13:59:56] <Bish> button.click(function(){$('#goldrechner').Goldrechner('addrow');}); , which wasn't workng
[14:00:10] <Bish> i didnt try to use, "this" yet,.. should be working, but im interested in a solution anyways
[14:00:11] <Eviltwin> And where do you init it?
[14:00:22] <Bish> well, after creation of button
[14:00:25] <Innocentus> How can I find a name for a plugin without conflicting with existing ones?
[14:00:34] <Eviltwin> Bish: You initialized it after the click?
[14:00:35] <Innocentus> I tried to call the plugin position - but this conflicted with jquery
[14:00:43] <Innocentus> so what name can I use safely?
[14:00:59] <ajpiano> Innocentus: position isn't a plugin, it's a method in jquery core
[14:01:01] <Bish> well, i fixed the problem, so there is no need anymore, but my question would still be
[14:01:08] <Bish> how can i call a "method" from outside
[14:01:12] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: Have you used the WebKit Developer Tools before?
[14:01:14] <ajpiano> Innocentus: console.dir(jQuery.fn) and don't pick any of those names
[14:02:35] <Eviltwin> Bish: Call a method from outside...
[14:02:36] <Eviltwin> ?
[14:03:02] <phuff> So, I'm doing an animate on a div
[14:03:14] <Bish> yeah like creation the "plugindiv" with $('selector').plugin();, and later calling something from outisde $('selector').someFunction();
[14:03:30] <Bish> or more like $(selector).plugin('someFunction');
[14:03:37] <Eviltwin> Right, that's how you call it
[14:03:46] <phuff> but during the final step of the animation when it's supposed to be moving to it's ultimate left: value, there are two copies of the element;  one that the animation is operating on that doesn't exist anymore, and the one that's in the dom.
[14:04:11] <Eviltwin> phuff: ...why?
[14:04:12] <phuff> Since the final step of the animation apparently has a copy of the old verison of the div, my animation isn't effectual
[14:04:17] <phuff> I dunno.
[14:04:29] <phuff> the best part is that it only happens intermittently during qunit tests :)
[14:04:32] <Innocentus> ajpiano: can I also use it on firefox console?
[14:04:37] <ajpiano> yep
[14:04:40] <Eviltwin> Are you doing something like .animate(...).remove() ?
[14:04:50] <phuff> Eviltwin: no
[14:04:51] <Innocentus> ajpiano: jQuery is not defined
[14:04:58] <ajpiano> Innocentus: ...
[14:05:00] <Innocentus> ajpiano: but it is on that damn page
[14:05:34] <phuff> Eviltwin: I just do an .animate() on a class
[14:05:36] <ajpiano> i'm not here to debug some random problem like that..... the point is... don't pick a method that's already defined in jquery
[14:05:39] <ajpiano> you can also look at the docs or anything
[14:05:47] <Bish> Eviltwin, also, if I redraw an HtmlElement, events which are connected to that are killed, right? thats awful :D
[14:06:17] <Eviltwin> If you "redraw" it no, if you replace it, yes
[14:06:58] <Bish> well if i have an div, add another div to it, use .click on that "inner" div, remove the html from the "outer" div, and reinsert the inner div, would the click event still be connected to the inner div?
[14:07:25] <Eviltwin> No because you've replaced the contents of the outer div with new elements
[14:07:53] <Bish> so the "inner" div gets deleted, because its not "visible" in DOM anymore?
[14:08:00] <Eviltwin> If you want to preserve it move the elements instead of the HTML
[14:08:20] <Bish> i see, i will have to rewrite that plugin ;)
[14:08:37] <Eviltwin> That's perfectly fine with me
[14:08:59] <Bish> i figured it that way
[14:09:04] <eddiemonge> ?detach @ Bish
[14:09:05] <bot-t> Bish, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[14:09:25] <Bish> eddiemonge, can i reattach them ?
[14:09:29] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:09:35] <Eviltwin> By using the other DOM manipulation commands
[14:09:45] <Bish> so they will completely disappear?
[14:10:14] <eddiemonge> no, they will be removed from the the dom (and view) but not completely disappear. completely disappear is removed
[14:11:02] <Eviltwin> They won't be visible anywhere until you reattach them
[14:11:06] <jaequery> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs   ,  i need to make it show a tab manually, and on their example they mention $('#myTab').tab('show');  but what does #myTab refer to? is that the id of the link menu or content ?
[14:11:45] <Eviltwin> jaequery: Scroll down to the Methods example
[14:11:49] <Eviltwin> It's right there
[14:12:11] <jaequery> its even more confusing , $('.tabs a:last').tab('show')  , what does .tabs refer to?
[14:12:22] <jaequery> on their markup, there is no, tabs class
[14:12:47] <Eviltwin> Well they're clearly selecting an <A> either way
[14:13:38] <jaequery> good point
[14:13:40] <eddiemonge> jaequery: things like that are why i recommend not using twitter's bootstrap
[14:13:40] <jaequery> :)
[14:13:59] <cambazz> hello, i have an error logging function that will post some data on a servlet if some error occurs. so I have to know the query and post it in order to fix the bug. so I have a '?query=' + encodeURIComponent(this.url)
[14:14:05] <jaequery> eddiemonge: what are the alternative?
[14:14:11] <Eviltwin> jaequery: HTML
[14:14:11] <jaequery> i dont really like jqueryui either
[14:14:12] <cambazz> this.url works in some pages and not in other pages.
[14:15:45] <eddiemonge> jaequery: what dont you like about jqueryui?
[14:16:11] <eddiemonge> cambazz: what is this? are you referring to the window?
[14:16:19] <eddiemonge> cambazz: as in window.location?
[14:16:51] <jaequery> eddiemonge: theming it is a bit of a pain
[14:17:08] <cambazz> hmm, no, a it is a $.ajax ... error: myErrorFunctionThatDoesPost
[14:17:26] <jaequery> their themeroller really throws me off
[14:17:29] <jaequery> :/
[14:17:32] <Eviltwin> cambazz: see ?ajax
[14:17:32] <bot-t> cambazz, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:17:37] <cambazz> so this.url should be the query of the parent call
[14:17:54] <eddiemonge> jaequery: whats wrong with the themeroller?
[14:17:59] <Eviltwin> cambazz: Specifically "context"
[14:18:27] <eddiemonge> cambazz: so your ajax error handler .... is another ajax call?
[14:18:29] <jaequery> too many classes
[14:18:30] <Whirl3d> so, being completely brain damaged, I can't figure out the simplest hash-based navigation. I thought I had it worked out, but the wireframe of my page demonstrates clearly that I don't get CSS at all. I have tried a dozen different combinations. What is the problem?   http://127.0.0.1:8080/home/index9.html:
[14:18:41] <cambazz> eddiemonge: yes
[14:18:45] <jaequery> but coming back to the bootstrap problem, still having issues
[14:18:53] <jaequery> let me write a jsfiddle real quick
[14:18:59] <eddiemonge> jaequery: you should ask twitter since its their library
[14:19:04] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Look carefully at the link you just posted
[14:19:08] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: was that supposed to be a link to something
[14:19:15] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:19:17] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: i <3 you sometimes
[14:19:22] <eddiemonge> ok im lying

[14:23:29] <safani> what is the correct syntax or where is a learning resource with that information
[14:23:48] <Whirl3d> at any given moment, there should be 2 (a yellow section box and a pic page box)
[14:23:55] <Eviltwin> safani: Well here's a start see ?object
[14:23:56] <bot-t> safani, object.foo === object["foo"]
[14:24:31] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I see like 4 stacked
[14:24:38] <Bish> Eviltwin, detaching a element which is not in DOM already, will result in an error?
[14:25:29] <eddiemonge> safani: ive always done, if its a variable or a number i use foo[bar] otherwise foo.bar
[14:26:26] <eddiemonge> ? isattached
[14:26:27] <bot-t> eddiemonge, #6487 (Live submit does not work after live click in ie6) – jQuery ... - Opened 14 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6487
[14:26:38] <rroelofs> safani: just keep in mind that foo['me'] means foo is an object
[14:26:44] <Eviltwin> Bish: It shouldn't, I don't think
[14:27:06] <Eviltwin> Bish: Doesn't for me
[14:27:50] <safani> im using $.parseJSON(data) to parse some json sent back
[14:28:04] <safani> and i have this large complicated object that i only want two things out of
[14:28:13] <eddiemonge> safani: sent back from an ajax query?
[14:28:21] <safani> yea through jsonp
[14:28:22] <Eviltwin> safani: Can we see an example of the JSON?
[14:29:26] <rroelofs> safani: this is a handy tool  http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
[14:29:45] <rroelofs> it helps you see the structure of your json
[14:29:53] <safani> http://pastebin.com/LDps5rdd here is the ajax portion
[14:30:15] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[14:30:16] <safani> ohhh you want the json returns
[14:30:17] <Eviltwin> And the JSON?
[14:30:19] <eddiemonge> safani: you dont need to parseJSON then
[14:30:25] <Eviltwin> The JSON
[14:31:09] <eddiemonge> safani: what is displayed in the console? an object looking thing right?
[14:35:55] <d4rklit3> fyi, change only works if you hi
[14:35:58] <d4rklit3> oops
[14:35:58] <d4rklit3> ok
[14:35:59] <d4rklit3> hi
[14:36:05] <d4rklit3> how do i do something like this:  $(this+ " img")
[14:36:12] <d4rklit3> that returns and error
[14:36:15] <Eviltwin> d4rklit3: see ?find
[14:36:16] <bot-t> d4rklit3, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[14:36:40] <Eviltwin> $("table td") and $("table").find("td") produce the same result
[14:36:53] <Eviltwin> $("ul > li") and $("ul").find("> li") produce the same result
[14:37:08] <d4rklit3> thanks
[14:37:37] <safani> eddiemonge yes a object looking thingy
[14:37:53] <Eviltwin> safani: Can we see an example of the actual JSON?
[14:39:43] <safani> http://pastebin.com/Anz4Stnq here you go
[14:40:17] <eddiemonge> safani: so what are you trying to do? whats the problem?
[14:40:22] <Eviltwin> So this object has several keys
[14:40:32] <safani> all i need is the coordinates
[14:40:49] <Eviltwin> "authenticationResultCode", "brandLogoUri", "copyright", "resourceSets", "statusCode", "statusDescription", and "traceId"
[14:40:57] <safani> ok
[14:41:12] <Eviltwin> So the first thing you need to do is something like theObject.resourceSets
[14:41:17] <Eviltwin> Or theObject["resourceSets"]
[14:41:38] <Eviltwin> No other keys have any data at them
[14:42:04] <Eviltwin> Now theObject.resourceSets refers to that array (denoted by []'s)
[14:42:16] <Eviltwin> You access indices here 0, 1, 2, ... etc
[14:42:25] <Eviltwin> Or .length to see how many there are
[14:42:36] <Eviltwin> In this case .length will be 1 and the only data is at [0]
[14:42:58] <Eviltwin> So theObject.resourceSets[0] refers to that object starting at line 6
[14:43:03] <Eviltwin> (Objects denoted by {})
[14:43:19] <Eviltwin> That has the keys "estimatedTotal" and "resources"
[14:43:34] <Eviltwin> Presumably you're interested in stuff inside resources
[14:43:37] <safani> thats where i started but wh4en i print the object.resourceSets it says cannot read property of null
[14:43:40] <Eviltwin> So theObject.resourceSets[0].resources
[14:43:50] <safani> i did that too!
[14:44:00] <Eviltwin> safani: Did you fix what eddiemonge was telling you to?
[14:44:07] <safani> this is after using parsejson tho right? or without it
[14:44:19] <eddiemonge> no, dont use parsejson
[14:44:29] <eddiemonge> that is already happening when dataType is json or jsonp
[14:44:34] <Eviltwin> Because it's JSONP and you declared it waht way, it's already been aprsed
[14:44:36] <Eviltwin> parsed*
[14:44:43] <eddiemonge> that is one long string to get to coordinates data.resourceSets[0].resources[0].geocodePoints[0].coordinates
[14:44:59] <Eviltwin> So you actually want data.resourceSets[0].resources etc
[14:45:11] <safani> oh...cool
[14:45:23] <Eviltwin> And none of the $.parseJSON stuff
[14:45:28] <safani> so i did get it somewhat right. i guess lol thanks so much
[14:45:57] <Eviltwin> JSON is pretty easy to traverse, that's part of the reason it's so popular
[14:46:02] <Eviltwin> It's simple yet flexible
[14:46:27] <Eviltwin> And can be used to represent any non-cyclic data structure
[14:47:42] <safani> well heres my answer thelocation.resourceSets[0].resources[0].point.coordinates[0]
[14:48:30] <tw2113> mmm json
[14:48:41] <safani> oh ..and your answer two
[14:48:44] <safani> too
[14:54:15] <danzik171> Eviltwin: mind spot-checking something for me before i submit a bug for jqui?  doesn't look like the constructor is being set properly when inheriting from widgets:  http://jsfiddle.net/UgNUT/
[14:56:24] <Eviltwin> danzik171: When not inheriting, it appears to be Object as well
[14:57:16] <Eviltwin> I think this is expected behavior
[14:57:36] <Eviltwin> But I could be wrong
[14:57:38] <Eviltwin> I actually have to run
[14:57:48] <Eviltwin> Might be worth asking in the dev channel
[14:57:53] <danzik171> true
[14:58:44] <danzik171> actually ajpiano is here:  is http://jsfiddle.net/UgNUT/ the intended behavior when inheriting from widgets ( with regard to the constructor )
[15:00:00] <ajpiano> danzik171: i'm not entirely sure, but have you checked on 1.9 as well?
[15:01:29] <danzik171> ajpiano: nope, i'll do that....looking for a link to 1.9 now
[15:01:44] <ajpiano> bit.ly/jquigitjs
[15:03:09] <danzik171> ajpiano: yup, good catch - already fixed in 1.9 - constructor is working how i was expected it to
[15:03:15] <ajpiano> ah :)
[15:03:17] <ajpiano> had a feeling
[15:03:22] <ravenzz> ajpiano have you ever used the gnarf newContent plugin?
[15:05:00] <multiHYP> hi all
[15:05:34] <multiHYP> i have a piece of code for infinite scrolling with jquery. it works alright on safari and chrome, but on iOS and desktop firefox it doesn't work at all...
[15:06:44] <multiHYP> i would appreciate it a lot if anybody could help.
[15:07:18] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ multiHYP
[15:07:19] <bot-t> multiHYP, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:07:20] <Innocentus> hi
[15:07:46] <multiHYP> yes, here: http://jsfiddle.net/multiHYP/nrAWz/
[15:08:02] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: Was one key away from sending the exact same thing
[15:09:09] <Innocentus> this works: $('body .image');
[15:09:18] <kibble> first off that's mootools secondly there is no markup
[15:09:18] <multiHYP> with jsfiddle i cannot get anything to scroll, but it works on my html pages: http://jsfiddle.net/multiHYP/nrAWz/1/
[15:09:20] <Innocentus> but this won't, why: $('body').children('.image');
[15:09:24] <Innocentus> please help
[15:09:37] <Eviltwin> You don't act until they're actually at the bottom pixel?
[15:09:39] <multiHYP> oops
[15:09:46] <jedimind> $('body .image)
[15:09:48] <jedimind> '
[15:09:51] <jedimind> somewhere in there
[15:10:00] <eddiemonge> multiHYP: you have to add jquery on the left http://jsfiddle.net/nrAWz/3/
[15:10:05] <multiHYP> http://jsfiddle.net/multiHYP/nrAWz/2/
[15:10:12] <Innocentus> jedimind: and if I get a jquery instance - like myDiv - and I want to get all children with class name of myDiv?
[15:10:29] <Innocentus> $myDiv.children('.image') won't work
[15:10:30] <Innocentus> why
[15:10:34] <Eviltwin> Innocebtus: $("body").find(".image")
[15:10:36] <trentm> The "Bug Tracker" link on http://jquery.com/ is to "http://dev.jquery.com/" which is a 404. Should be to bugs.jquery.com, right? Where's a good place to report that?
[15:10:48] <multiHYP> yes, corrected it. didn't notice that. so why is it a sometimes working solution?
[15:10:51] <Eviltwin> .children is specific to immediate children
[15:11:02] <Eviltwin> .find searches descendants
[15:11:10] <Eviltwin> e.g. grandchildren
[15:11:29] <eddiemonge> danheberden: The "Bug Tracker" link on http://jquery.com/ is to "http://dev.jquery.com/" which is a 404. Should be to bugs.jquery.com, right? Where's a good place to report that?
[15:11:42] <eddiemonge> id fix it myself but i dont have my keys for it
[15:12:28] <Innocentus> ah
[15:14:11] <multiHYP> http://jsfiddle.net/multiHYP/nrAWz/6/ <- not much better really. what is wrong with it?
[15:14:23] <multiHYP> certainly not testable inside jsfiddle's frame
[15:14:47] <Eviltwin> Append show/ to the URL
[15:15:09] <multiHYP> but anyhow, the code i have works on only certain desktop browsers. it fails on firefox and on iOS does not always work. any advice?
[15:15:29] <Eviltwin> I'm on an iPhone right now and it logs just fine
[15:16:00] <eddiemonge> multiHYP: $(document).height() - $(document).height() will always be 0
[15:16:14] <multiHYP> yes i know
[15:16:19] <multiHYP> original example was http://jsfiddle.net/multiHYP/nrAWz/8/
[15:16:25] <Eviltwin> Perhaps you have a CSS issue somewhere
[15:16:29] <multiHYP> but nobody responded so i kept iterating
[15:17:07] <eddiemonge> whats the problem and what are you trying to do?
[15:17:16] <multiHYP> infinite scrolling
[15:17:29] <multiHYP> when it hits the bottom, it should say "hit it"
[15:17:44] <multiHYP> on any browser or device
[15:18:02] <multiHYP> my solution as in .../8/ does not do that conclusively
[15:18:50] <multiHYP> i see
[15:18:58] <multiHYP> thanks
[15:19:45] <dandaman> http://codepad.org/YEIVSNR4
[15:19:55] <dandaman> lines 16 and 18 have different values for toReturn
[15:20:00] <dandaman> i am need help with scoping :\
[15:21:22] <eddiemonge> dandaman: its not scope. its knowing that ajax is asynchronous
[15:21:33] <eddiemonge> meaning your post fires and then the rest keeps going
[15:21:42] <dandaman> eddiemonge: oh wow, forgot about that
[15:21:47] <dandaman> that's obvious
[15:28:37] <trentm> eddiemonge: Would a ticket on bugs.jquery.com for the incorrect dev.jquery.com link be appropriate?
[15:32:57] <chrisl_> Hi all, using jquery UI buttons. If I change the text for a button it reverts back to a normal link.  if I call button() on that element again (after changing the text) the padding is all off
[15:33:19] <chrisl_> it appears to be missing a span with class="ui-button-text"
[15:33:37] <chrisl_> Am I doing this wrong, or is there a way to sort this out?
[15:34:30] <tr3nton> just been researching on how to get event data attached to an element, and anything I find suggests either: $(element).data('events') or $.data(element, 'events').... however this doesn't return anything even though i know there are events attached. Is there a better method? (Even though everything suggests this, i haven't found and docs suggested 'events' is a valid key, so may be there is a better way?
[15:38:56] <cambazz> how can i simulate an error in a .ajaxSubmit
[15:38:57] <Phrogz> 1) I $.ajax load an XML document. 2) $('#contents').append( $(xmlDocument).find('#contents > *') );  Result: all the nodes are imported into my page...yay! Exceptâ€¦what's this? Every node as a computed style of display:inline.
[15:38:58] <Phrogz> WTF?
[15:39:42] <Phrogz> I've also tried   $xml.find('#contents > *').each(function(){  $content.append(document.importNode(this,true));  });   Same result.
[15:41:07] <eddiemonge> trentm: yes. assign it to infrastructure if you can
[15:41:37] <eddiemonge> tr3nton: how are you attaching the event handlers?
[15:41:54] <eddiemonge> cambazz: put in a bad url. or look at see ? mockjax
[15:42:00] <bot-t> cambazz, Integration into Browser Automation Tools - Documentation - jQuery - http://docs.jquery.com/action/render/QUnit?diff=next&oldid=20604&
[15:42:22] <Phrogz> tr3nton: What do you mean by "events attached"? You mean that you have registered event handlers and are trying to enumerate them?
[15:42:56] <tr3nton> eddiemonge: events aren't attached by me.
[15:43:06] <eddiemonge> then how are they attached?
[15:43:56] <tr3nton> eddiemonge: its a web dev framework, and the interface is built for you
[15:44:08] <eddiemonge> tr3nton: that didnt really answer the question
[15:44:32] <trentm> eddiemonge: Done. bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11506   I don't have perms to assign to infrastructure. Cheers.
[15:45:47] <Phrogz> tr3nton: Events do not get 'attached' to things. Event handlers (functions) are registered to handle particular events, or else you are associating the event data with an element.
[15:45:54] <tr3nton> eddiemonge: well somewhere in the code, the tool would be adding the events to elements. I ahven't yet dug down to find out where/how
[15:46:08] <Phrogz> tr3nton: I wouldn't normally be such a stickler for accurate terminology, but I'm trying to ascertain exactly what your problem is.
[15:47:41] <cambazz> ok, well i now simulate a bad request. :) nice
[15:47:42] <tr3nton> well, really want i want to do is replace the keydown event, rather than attach an additional, to provide a bit more customization... probably not necessary to get existing events into a variable, and just replace it... was just doing that as a starting point
[15:47:46] <Phrogz> tr3nton: Please clarify what you mean by "add the events to the elements"
[15:48:07] <Phrogz> tr3nton: So there's an existing keydown handler on an element, and you want to swap it out with your own?
[15:48:28] <tr3nton> yeah
[15:49:00] <cambazz> i rephrase my question, when we have a $(form).ajaxSubmit({success: somefunction, complete: completefunction, error: errorfunction}) <- how can we tell the errorfunction where it has been called from?
[15:50:51] <Phrogz> tr3nton: Can you get a handle to the function that was previously added as an event handler? (Is it within code you control and fully exposed, or is it some closed-over and/or anonymous function in other code?)
[15:51:00] * Phrogz senses that tr3nton may be up to no good. :p
[15:51:30] <Innocentus> I got a funny question
[15:51:38] <Innocentus> How can I construct a parameter name as string?
[15:51:40] <Phrogz> Update on my problem: apparently the XHTML doc I'm importing is missing the namespace declaration, and thus the nodes are coming in with no namespace instead of a proper xhtml namespace. Hence them being treated as semantically void.
[15:51:48] <tr3nton> lol
[15:51:49] <Phrogz> Innocentus: ?
[15:52:01] <Innocentus> I tried with      test[' + testID.toString() +']
[15:52:04] <Innocentus> but it doesn't work
[15:52:05] <ajpiano> Phrogz: you might also want to look into using see ?parseXML
[15:52:06] <bot-t> Phrogz, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[15:52:14] <Phrogz> Innocentus: test[testID]
[15:52:21] <Innocentus> ah
[15:52:23] <Innocentus> uh
[15:52:33] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Is that not used internally by dataType:'xml' ?
[15:52:44] <tr3nton> yeah that may be better then.. jsut override the existing function
[15:52:55] <ajpiano> i think so. but it's not used by $(xmlstring)
[15:52:57] <Phrogz> trentm: You can removeEventListener if you have a reference to the function.
[15:53:16] <Innocentus> I want this: { test[' + testID.toString() +']: testvalue }
[15:53:16] * tr3nton is up to good, just a bug in the framework that im trying to overcome
[15:53:20] <VioByte> any prefered contextmenu plugins?
[15:53:35] <Innocentus> { 'test[' + testID.toString() +']': testvalue }
[15:53:37] <Innocentus> now it is right
[15:53:41] <Innocentus> but it doesn't work
[15:53:48] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Gotcha. With dataType:'xml' I'm getting back an XML document already, that I'm wrapping with $() for selector queries.
[15:54:03] <ajpiano> Innocentus: the *only* way to have a dynamic key name in an object is to use bracket syntax *after* the object is created
[15:54:14] <ajpiano> you can't assign a dynamic key name inside of an object literal
[15:54:17] <Phrogz> Innocentus:     params = {}; params[testID] = testValue;   then use params
[15:54:28] <Innocentus> great
[15:58:32] <RandalSchwartz> does twitter bootstrap dovetail with jquery-ui, or is it meant to replace it?
[16:02:38] <raj> if I do $('.myelem').clone().find('option:selected')..removeAttr('selected')...would this remove it from the original, or the clone?
[16:02:51] <raj> with 1 . before removeAttr
[16:03:10] <ajpiano> the clone
[16:03:29] <raj> geez, that explains a lot
[16:03:32] <raj> thank you
[16:04:26] <Innocentus> ok
[16:05:19] <eddiemonge> RandalSchwartz: its meant to bastardize it and leave the good parts behind
[16:14:28] <deathguppie> so I admit to being new.. but I just can't seem to get a page to wait to display until everything has loaded.. everything pops up.. then the animations start.. makes fadeIn pretty useless
[16:14:28] <BinaryKitten> RandalSchwartz  it's not meant to replace it.. It doesn't offer the same amount of complexity
[16:14:29] <Innocentus> I half-faded an element with fadeTo
[16:14:35] <Innocentus> now I try to fade it in again with fadeIn()
[16:14:40] <Innocentus> but nothing happens
[16:17:54] <Innocentus> I mean, normally fadeIn should fade everything in again, right?
[16:18:10] <Innocentus> but appearently this won't work with elements where fadeTo has been applied on
[16:18:17] <Innocentus> *before
[16:18:36] <Emn1ty> does fadeTo work in reverse?
[16:18:44] <Emn1ty> as in, can you increase opacity with it?
[16:19:45] <Emn1ty> innocentus: why not just use fadeTo and return the opacity back to full?
[16:20:02] <Innocentus> fadeTo in reverse works
[16:20:13] <Innocentus> yes, but wouldn't be fadeIn more inuitive?
[16:21:59] <erebel55> lo
[16:22:13] <Emn1ty> Innocentus: I think fadeTo is exclusive to itself.
[16:22:45] <ColKurtz> fadeIn and fadeOut both animate opacity and then make it display:none; or do the reverse
[16:22:50] <Innocentus> ah
[16:22:50] <ColKurtz> fadeTo is strictly opacity
[16:23:15] <ColKurtz> so for an element to fadeIn, it needs to have display:none; set, or you need to fade it out first
[16:23:22] <ColKurtz> iirc
[16:23:23] <Innocentus> ah
[16:31:49] <Innocentus> A callback function is given to a custom function, how can the custom function call the callback function?
[16:31:53] <Innocentus> Is there a jquery-way?
[16:31:55] <ddilinger> is there any thing besides $.fn.unbind that would cause an element to lose its events?  I'm trying to debug an issue where i bind some events, they are visible with $._data(this.someEl[0]), then later they are not.  To make sure the property isnt being replaced i stored it in window._my_debug, and === claims its still the same object, just no bound events
[16:32:26] <ajpiano> ddilinger: are you calling .remove() on the element?
[16:32:36] <ajpiano> Innocentus: that's a basic javascript thing, there's not a "jquery way"
[16:32:39] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: theres a javascript way
[16:33:01] <Innocentus> what would be recommended and used by jquery itself?
[16:33:07] <ajpiano> function whatever( callback ) { /* do other stuff */ callback(); }     whatever(function() { alert("hi"} );
[16:33:08] <ddilinger> ajpiano: hmm, no but i am bouncing it arround from one place to annother with append, might do it i suppose
[16:33:34] <ajpiano> hmm no i don't believe it should happen in that case
[16:34:04] <Innocentus> oh so easy
[16:34:05] <Innocentus> wow
[16:34:07] <Innocentus> thank you
[16:34:49] <erebel55_> so basically, I'm querying for an svg that contains a <g>. is there anyway to get the <g> from the svg?
[16:35:48] <Innocentus> I often have to switch two different click handlers on and off, I tried it with namespaced click handlers and on() and off(), but off() also deletes the whole click handler
[16:35:55] <Innocentus> I don't want to redefine the click handler again and again
[16:36:14] <Innocentus> elem.off('click.test') will also delete the handler
[16:36:18] <ajpiano> what
[16:36:21] <Innocentus> I cannot simply call elem.on('click.test');
[16:36:29] <Innocentus> I have to redefine the whole handler function
[16:36:31] <ajpiano> you want to toggle between a series of different handlers?
[16:36:47] <Innocentus> yes
[16:36:50] <Innocentus> exactly
[16:36:53] <ajpiano> ?toggle(fn)
[16:36:54] <bot-t> .toggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle2
[16:37:00] <ajpiano> meh, wrong one
[16:37:24] <ajpiano> Innocentus: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[16:37:34] <imanc> how can I get the tag name of the element, when I do â€¦ $(this).parent().parent().next() ?
[16:37:38] <ajpiano> Innocentus: additionally you can use a named function when you don't want to write out the same anonymous function many times
[16:37:40] <imanc> i've tried .tagName, but no dice.
[16:37:45] <ajpiano> imanc: [0].tagName
[16:37:53] <imanc> ajpiano: aha, thanks
[16:37:58] <Innocentus> great
[16:39:21] <Innocentus> ajpiano: great thing, but I want to enable the secondary handler only, if some checks have passed (in the script)
[16:39:32] <ajpiano> mmhmm
[16:39:41] <Innocentus> ajpiano: but toggle would enable the secondary handler directly after the first click
[16:39:42] <ajpiano> ok well in that case named functions are gonna be your love and glory
[16:39:50] <Innocentus> ajpiano: screams
[16:39:58] <ajpiano> Innocentus: cause you can bind and unbind with a function reference
[16:40:04] <Innocentus> ah
[16:40:49] <ajpiano> function foo() {} function bar() {};  $(".stuff").on("click", foo).on("click", bar").off("click", foo);
[16:40:55] <ajpiano> will only leave bar attached, for instance
[16:41:01] <Innocentus> ah yes
[16:41:10] <Innocentus> and the other one is destroyed through off(), right?
[16:41:17] <ajpiano> yep
[16:41:31] <ajpiano> instead of using namespaced functions you're just like
[16:41:34] <ajpiano> literally, use this function
[16:41:44] <ajpiano> and literally detach this function if it's there
[16:41:49] <Innocentus> looks great
[16:41:57] <Innocentus> ok, and there is another thing
[16:42:14] <Innocentus> there are two buttons, only one button should be shown at time, and after some other time, the other button should shown
[16:42:27] <Innocentus> both buttons got different captions which are translated on server-side
[16:43:14] <ajpiano> and
[16:44:17] <eddiemonge> and then
[16:44:51] <Innocentus> then only one button should be shown for each available operation
[16:45:08] <Innocentus> f.ex. first button says 'select', the second one says 'unselect'
[16:45:12] <Innocentus> both should be switched
[16:45:17] <Innocentus> what would be the best way
[16:45:41] <imsky> pew pew
[16:46:10] <ajpiano> Innocentus: add a class to the container based on what type of "operation" is happening
[16:46:32] <ajpiano> then just write some css so that the right button is display: none; when the particular state is on the parent element
[16:46:39] <ajpiano> would be one approach
[16:46:49] <erebel55> gah sorry internet screwing up
[16:46:58] <eddiemonge> or you could have just one button that changes text and actions depending on context
[16:47:26] <Innocentus> ok
[16:47:47] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: would be nice, but the text is translated on server-side and the js is in an external file
[16:49:37] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: you could send the text as a data attribute
[16:50:27] <Innocentus> right
[16:54:47] <eddiemonge> correct
[17:01:37] <Innocentus> where should jquery localized / string be stored? before including the plugin-js?
[17:16:09] <abjorn> imsky you mudda fukka
[17:16:18] <imsky> i'm so throwed
[17:16:27] <imsky> just responded to 3 emails from people about cssfx
[17:17:36] <eddiemonge> damn woot wont let me buy
[17:18:19] <abjorn> niace
[17:18:53] <abjorn> I was busy today making my coworkers javascript at least kind of pass jslint
[17:18:59] <imsky> lol jslint
[17:19:06] <abjorn> only the important shit
[17:19:10] <imsky> that cool
[17:19:18] <abjorn> they were long files, i didn't feel like combing through the important shit
[17:19:19] <abjorn> so i was like
[17:19:21] <imsky> you should convert all trues and falses to !0 and !1
[17:19:23] <abjorn> "jslint, look through this for me"
[17:19:25] <imsky> make em think
[17:19:28] <abjorn> lol
[17:20:15] <abjorn> time to watch top gear all night awww yeeaah
[17:20:20] <imsky> man
[17:20:23] <imsky> you're gonna be an expert
[17:20:36] <abjorn> and play around with ICS :D at&t just put out an update today for my phone
[17:20:49] <imsky> word up
[17:21:19] <Innocentus> How can I copy all css-styles from element A to element B? :)
[17:21:30] <imsky> my phone has been left out of the new updates
[17:22:09] <abnormalex> what if i want to make a desktop app with JS as primary language...
[17:22:15] <abnormalex> preferably without my end user needing WAMP or similar
[17:22:19] <imsky> sir do i have a proposition for you
[17:22:33] <imsky> gluescript, xulrunner, or chromium embedded
[17:22:42] <JoeyCadle> abnormalex, the guys who make Titanium SDK have a framework to do exactly that
[17:22:44] <abnormalex> ill take it
[17:22:46] <abnormalex> twice
[17:22:57] <imsky> steam runs on chromium embedded
[17:23:05] <abnormalex> nice
[17:23:11] <imsky> xulrunner powers a lot of stuff
[17:23:17] <JoeyCadle> abnormalex, http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-desktop-application-development/
[17:23:19] <Innocentus> How can I copy all css-styles from element A to element B? :)
[17:23:19] <imsky> google adwords editor, firefox, thunderbird, etc
[17:23:22] <abnormalex> and gluescript,xulrunner,chromium, and titanium will not require wamp?
[17:23:26] <imsky> no they won't
[17:23:31] <abnormalex> also, i need a db
[17:23:37] <imsky> sqlite
[17:23:38] <abnormalex> was looking at sqlite, mongo
[17:23:49] <imsky> titanium is iffy to me
[17:23:52] <imsky> doesn't seem independent
[17:24:03] <abnormalex> dependant on what?
[17:24:05] <abjorn> also it uses javascriptcore which is totally shit
[17:24:42] <imsky> Innocentus: there isn't an easy way. you have to maintain a map of styles that are to be mapped to element A
[17:25:02] <Innocentus> imsky: really not? damn
[17:25:17] <imsky> i mean..you can just .clone() it or use a class
[17:26:27] <Innocentus> imsky: when I clone it, I also clone the children / content of the element, right?
[17:26:37] <imsky> yep
[17:26:55] <Innocentus> can I prevent this?
[17:27:03] <abnormalex> does anyone recommend luescript/xulrunner/chromium/titanium
[17:27:04] <imsky> write a clone replica that doesn't do children
[17:27:05] <Innocentus> I only want to clone the element, empty, only the con
[17:27:08] <Innocentus> only the container
[17:27:16] <imsky> or just call .empty() on the clone
[17:27:18] <Innocentus> imsky: and in that clone replica they also clone the css?
[17:27:33] <imsky> if the css is set inline sure
[17:27:36] <Innocentus> imsky: what is about performance? when the clone is emptied, there was data allocated before for the contents
[17:27:43] <imsky> yeah that's a tough one
[17:27:56] <imsky> if this is a huge consideration, just write a plugin that does it
[17:28:17] <Innocentus> imsky: ok
[17:28:27] <Innocentus> imsky: how can I swap two elements?
[17:28:43] <imsky> .after and .insert should help you out there
[17:29:04] <Innocentus> imsky: so with after I get the position for the other element
[17:30:12] <imsky> Innocentus: http://jsfiddle.net/FMkDE/
[17:30:15] <imsky> something like this
[17:31:35] <imsky> bot-t am i a dragon?
[17:31:42] <imsky> come on bot
[17:31:54] <imsky> bot-t: you slow piece of crap
[17:31:54] <bot-t> imsky, Is that a question?
[17:31:58] <imsky> there we go
[17:32:03] <imsky> bot-t: am i a dragon?
[17:32:03] <bot-t> imsky, Ask again later.
[17:32:08] <imsky> all righty then
[17:32:15] <coldhead> poor bot-t is doing her best
[17:35:51] <CrazyTux[m]> I'm running into an issue where I am manipulating DOM / HTML, i.e. adding a select box and then immediately making another call in order to populate the select box options, but it appears that I'm running into an issue where there is a race condition it seems and I'm getting an error 'cannot read property options of type null' ?  Any ideas / thoughts?
[17:36:48] <Innocentus> imsky: how can I remove an element from a parent element without destroying it?
[17:37:05] <imsky> without destroying what
[17:37:16] <imsky> removing implies destruction man
[17:37:43] <Innocentus> imsky: it should disappear on the document but it should then reused later
[17:38:23] <Innocentus> imsky: ok, I did it in a different way now

[19:55:30] <Aquilas> hey guys can the map of jQuery.get send out an array?
[19:56:12] <NChief> Eviltwin: thanks! I will try it out :)
[19:56:18] <KwameBoy> Italian_Plumber: Come back, I love you!!!!
[19:56:44] <Eviltwin> Aquilas: You mean the data that goes with it?
[19:56:51] <Eviltwin> It gets passed through $.param
[19:58:02] <Aquilas> for example the map would be "var map = {checkList : array} array would obviously be an array of values
[19:58:22] <KwameBoy> Eviltwin: The POST body should contain a field for each element in the array serialized.
[19:58:23] <Aquilas> and then in the php  I would do $array = $_REQUEST['array']
[19:58:33] <Aquilas> and then $array would have all the values
[19:58:43] <chrisl_> FYI, I was able to sort my issue (i.e. changing UI Button text removes button style or changes it's style drastically)
[19:58:47] <Eviltwin> Aquilas: Look a the examples here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[19:59:03] <Eviltwin> And what it says after "As of jQuery 1.4,"
[19:59:13] <chrisl_> by using $('a.blah').button('option', 'label', 'tyadda yadda')
[19:59:24] <dev2> How can I get all of the html for a given element? (.html() only gives the "inner" html)
[19:59:36] <Aquilas> hmmm
[20:00:08] <Eviltwin> dev2: $("#foo")[0].outerHTML
[20:00:29] <systemfault> Hmm...
[20:00:36] <systemfault> Y U SUGGEST THAT? :(
[20:00:58] <Eviltwin> He wanted the outerHTML
[20:01:47] <fission6> i am trying to show an icon when a user hovers over rows in a table, i show the icon next to the row which is currently being hovered over, how can i avoid rebinding or using live to handle if the use clicks the icon
[20:01:57] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Won't that fail on some browsers?
[20:02:06] <fission6> i bsically dont want to destory the icon and just position in the currently hovered row
[20:02:18] <Aquilas> not doing outerHTML I'm using jQuery.get with a php url and I want an array to go into that url somehow
[20:02:36] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Really, really old Firefox maybe
[20:02:39] <Aquilas> hopefully using map, but I'm not sure if just putting in array will do it
[20:03:19] <Eviltwin> fission6: Position it or actually move it around the DOM?
[20:03:44] <Eviltwin> Aquilas: Not everything I write in here is for you, other people are asking for help too
[20:04:54] <KwameBoy> Dave Bing wants to know how to find $45 million using jQuery.
[20:04:56] <fission6> Eviltwin: how do i remove it from row if i use remove it deletes, there is no other way to remove it
[20:05:12] <Eviltwin> fission6: see ?.detach
[20:05:12] <bot-t> fission6, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[20:06:25] <Aquilas> Ah well I think I got it. Some thing like this $.get("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"]} );
[20:06:33] <fission6> will bound click handlers still exist if i detach and then append somewhere else Eviltwin
[20:07:30] <Eviltwin> fission6: Read the first sentence under the method signature on that page
[20:08:23] <fission6> " keeps all jQuery data associated with the removed elements." does that include event handlers?
[20:10:48] <takkun1946> oh the fun with $.getScript
[20:11:21] <takkun1946> does anyone know if $.getScript is suppose to save the retrieved script in the DOM?
[20:13:18] <takkun1946> sorry, that question is probably terribly worded
[20:13:23] <Eviltwin> fission6: Yes
[20:15:03] <fission6> cool thanks'
[20:15:14] <dwarder> i have a class which is assigned to several div elements, i want to add 'test' class to the clicked,how should i reference the clicked div?
[20:15:49] <Eviltwin> What does your code look like right now?
[20:15:59] <Eviltwin> Have you bound a click listener to the div?
[20:16:41] <dwarder> one moment i'll create jsfiddle
[20:17:09] <KwameBoy> Eviltwin: I wait until I see the man coming with the big stick, then I do leave like a gentlemen if it's not too late.

[20:20:36] <Eviltwin> dwarder: Several problems here
[20:21:07] <Eviltwin> The divs have class loco while the selector is for logo.
[20:21:12] <improwizacja> how to enable support for jquery
[20:21:18] <Eviltwin> So you're not actually binding anything
[20:21:23] <improwizacja> in aptana
[20:21:33] <Eviltwin> Second look at the left hand side of the window, left of the code
[20:21:36] <Eviltwin> Where it says Choose Framework
[20:21:52] <Eviltwin> improwizacja: That's a question for #aptana, not #jquery
[20:21:53] <KwameBoy> Eviltwin: Yes.
[20:22:00] <shadykhan> i have a button that i want to switch text on click and then go back to original when clicked
[20:22:05] <shadykhan> how would i go about doing that?

[20:23:08] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: One solution is: see ? toggle-event
[20:23:08] <bot-t> shadykhan, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[20:23:28] <Eviltwin> improwizacja: We support jQuery, not Aptana
[20:23:49] <shadykhan> thank you
[20:24:05] <improwizacja> ok

[20:26:16] <DaveBing> Aptana looks interesting.
[20:26:19] <shadykhan> thanks Eviltwin
[20:32:08] <Whirl3d> I love Aptana 2
[20:35:08] <DaveBing> Whirl3d: What does it give you that you love?
[20:35:31] <DaveBing> Does it make building large web apps more manageable?
[20:35:39] <Whirl3d> clean interface, non-interruptive error info, outline features,
[20:36:12] <Whirl3d> I would think so, but I only use a small part of it
[20:42:07] <DaveBing> Does Aptana give the app sexiness?
[20:44:03] <dev2> http://jsfiddle.net/5s7UH/2/  when I use outerHTML here, it returns undefined.  Does that make any sense?
[20:44:58] <systemfault> dev2: Doesn't return undefined for me.
[20:45:15] <dev2> when you run that jsfiddle?
[20:45:20] <systemfault> Yeah.
[20:45:25] <dev2> hmmmm
[20:45:32] <systemfault> You're probably using an old version of firefox then :P
[20:46:35] <dev2> firefox 10
[20:47:49] <systemfault> Firefox 11
[20:47:56] <snover> Firefox 92!
[20:48:53] <systemfault> snover: When firefox 92 will be released... chrome will probably be at 500
[20:49:05] <snover> 9001!
[20:49:10] <snover> -i!
[20:51:11] <tash1> if I have 3 text fields, which are actually .datepicker ... but they all have unique id's (datepickerstart, datepickerend, datepickerfinished), isn't there a wildcard that says hook to each ID that starts with datepicker?
[20:51:25] <tash1> that could be a horribly phrased question, and for that, I'm sorry =\
[20:52:36] <Whirl3d> is there jquery method  to combine objects such that the property values of the first object are overwritten by the second, but no new properties are added to the first object (like with .extend)..
[20:52:36] <Hebo> Is it possible to get a list of global fns created by jsonp?
[20:53:07] <Hebo> or some other way to garbage collect them
[20:53:32] <fission6> i am writing a chrome extension for a page which loads content using ajax, how do i keep all my selectors active and "live" for any new content which may get injected
[20:53:54] <tash1> n/m, think I found my answer
[20:54:01] <tash1> that thing they call google, amazing
[20:54:02] <tash1> :)
[20:57:28] <Eviltwin> fission6: Do you know how .live works, I thought you were one of the people I explained it to
[20:59:01] <tw2113> oh shiz.... Eviltwin has an @
[20:59:05] <tw2113> explains so much
[20:59:17] <fission6> i dont know if live will help here
[20:59:38] <fission6> because reallu i am justy modifying some properties on the links when more are inject via ajax
[20:59:38] <Eviltwin> tw2113: No I don't
[20:59:56] <tw2113> clearly you stole the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter
[21:00:18] <Eviltwin> fission6: So make a function that does the modification you want to do
[21:00:27] <Eviltwin> Run it on load or whatever
[21:00:40] <Eviltwin> And with subsequent AJAX loads, apply it to the new data
[21:00:48] <fission6> i can't, this is inside a chrome extension so i dont have acceess to the native js which is causing the ajax laod
[21:01:10] <Eviltwin> How's that?
[21:01:14] <fission6> i guess i could listen to something generic and just run my "update code"
[21:01:18] <fission6> what do you mean?
[21:01:27] <Eviltwin> The extension isn't doing the loading?
[21:01:45] <Eviltwin> And I thought extensions let you do some kind of network interception
[21:02:29] <fission6> you can do the later but there is probably a way ic na listen to some generic event and just rerun my code to format <a> hrefs
[21:02:55] <fission6> ahhh Eviltwin http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844565/is-there-a-jquery-dom-change-listener
[21:05:51] <Eviltwin> You know the danger with that, right?
[21:05:59] <Eviltwin> And why it's deprecated
[21:06:22] <fission6> yes i think i just encountered it
[21:06:24] <fission6> i think
[21:06:27] <Eviltwin> Probably
[21:06:32] <fission6> endless loop
[21:06:34] <fission6> haha
[21:07:20] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:07:35] <Eviltwin> If your DOM mutation event listener mutates the DOM, guess what, new event
[21:07:42] <fission6> right
[21:07:47] <Eviltwin> That probably gets caught by your listener
[21:07:47] <fission6> ok so back to sqr one
[21:08:15] <fission6> is there an ajax complete listener or something i can use?
[21:09:41] <Eviltwin> fission6: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[21:17:30] <fission6> Eviltwin: Eviltwin http://dpaste.org/AhbZM/ ajaxComplete is not happening when an ajax event is occuring on the page
[21:18:30] <Eviltwin> You should know by now that I want you to make a jsFiddle instead
[21:19:09] <fission6> ok just tricky because of the fact its in an extension, but i guess that makes it even harder for you to help, let me think through this
[21:19:13] <fission6> thnaks
[21:20:58] <Eviltwin> Well it should be pretty easy to make a fiddle that has a ajaxComplete and an AJAX request
[21:21:11] <Eviltwin> If the problem is really as generic as you say it is, it shouldn't work.
[21:21:25] <jahrichie> i have an image that when someone hovers over it,  i'd like that div to scroll to the top, any recommendations ?
[21:22:12] <Eviltwin> jahrichie: Be more speficific? Show us what you have so far?
[21:22:26] <jahrichie> Eviltwin:  uploading now
[21:24:00] <jahrichie> Eviltwin: http://chyeaa.com/charlie-bravo/mgmt/  when someone hovers over an image in  Company Directors (#directors-grid) i'd like that div to scroll to the top
[21:24:11] <jahrichie> so the copy under that is above the fold
[21:24:14] <jahrichie> does that make sense?
[21:24:37] <Eviltwin> Do you mean scroll the page (as in the scrollbar changes) or move the div within the page (as in everything else stays where it was)?
[21:25:00] <jahrichie> Eviltwin:  basically, like an internal link would
[21:25:04] <jahrichie> take that div to the top
[21:25:04] <jahrichie> BUT
[21:25:19] <jahrichie> i can't use the # method because of the javascript in there for the slider
[21:25:38] <Eviltwin> jahrichie: And you're sture you want that on hover?
[21:25:52] <jahrichie> Eviltwin: could be click or hover
[21:26:09] <jahrichie> i might not even use it
[21:26:13] <jahrichie> but i'd like to experiment
[21:26:30] <jahrichie> I see people not finding the copy under the pictures in qa
[21:26:39] <Eviltwin> Which div are you speaking of?
[21:26:45] <Eviltwin> The one that says Company Directors at the top?
[21:27:08] <jahrichie> #directors-grid
[21:27:15] <jahrichie> i'd like that to be scrolled to the top
[21:27:49] <jahrichie> jquery stop()?
[21:27:54] <Eviltwin> You can snap with: $("html, body").scrollTop($("#directors-grid").offset().top);
[21:28:19] <jahrichie> Eviltwin: how would that be activated ?
[21:28:21] <Eviltwin> Or animate with $("html, body").animate({scrollTop: $("#directors-grid").offset().top});
[21:28:33] <Eviltwin> When it runs, they get scrolled
[21:28:44] <Eviltwin> So put it in a .click or .mouseover or something
[21:28:50] <Eviltwin> Some kind of event handler
[21:28:51] <jahrichie> roger that
[21:29:01] <jahrichie> i should be able to turn that over no prob
[21:29:02] <jahrichie> you rock
[21:29:12] <jahrichie> this channel is amazing
[21:31:55] <raj> I have a select element `$select`, and I'd like to remove all options within it that have a `value` found in `myarray`
[21:32:33] <raj> not sure the best way to do this without multiple forloops
[21:33:15] <jahrichie> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/Gy5xeVnv
[21:33:21] <jahrichie> no good right?
[21:35:26] <Eviltwin> raj: I would use one for loop to turn [ "abc", "def", ... ] into { "abc": true, "def": true, ...}
[21:35:50] <Eviltwin> Then use a truthy test on the property to see if it should be removed
[21:36:51] <raj> interesting Eviltwin
[21:36:59] <coldhead> interesting and brilliant
[21:37:27] <Eviltwin> It's a pretty common programming technique
[21:37:39] <Eviltwin> Gives you O(1) existence tests instead of O(n)
[21:37:42] <raj> i'm actually not exactly sure what you mean to be honest
[21:38:15] <raj> i can make the array look like that using $.map
[21:38:32] <raj> but not sure how the "truthy test on the property" play sout
[21:38:38] <Eviltwin> var arr = [...]; var obj = {}; for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { obj[arr[i]] = true; } if(obj[valueToCheckFor]) { ... } else { ... }
[21:38:39] <raj> *plays out
[21:38:46] <Eviltwin> Obviously just do that loop once
[21:38:55] <Eviltwin> Check as many times as you want using the obj you produce
[21:39:46] <jahrichie> yeah no good
[21:39:48] <jahrichie> darn
[21:39:52] <jahrichie> i'll try the other wya
[21:40:08] <Eviltwin> jahrichie: I ran the code I sent in the WebKit Dev Tools and it worked
[21:40:47] <jahrichie> Eviltwin: the code i wrote or the code you sent lol!
[21:41:13] <Eviltwin> The code I wrote works fine on its own on your page
[21:41:16] <Eviltwin> I tested it in the browser
[21:41:40] <jahrichie> true
[21:41:52] <jahrichie> i prob wrapped it wrong in that pastbin i shared
[21:46:22] <raj> Eviltwin, I don't see how if(obj[valueToCheckFor]){} is being used to remove <option>s
[21:46:39] <raj> how am I getting the values to check for?
[21:46:47] <raj> another for loops?
[21:46:50] <raj> another for loop
[21:47:03] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:47:03] <tw2113> this is pretty cool http://webdesigntutsplus.s3.amazonaws.com/tuts/313_waypoints/demo/index.html
[21:47:24] <raj> oh, ya, i thought there might be a way with less for loops
[21:47:35] <Eviltwin> So there's one loop to build the object
[21:47:42] <Eviltwin> Then after that loop, one loop for the values in the select
[21:48:03] <Eviltwin> No loops within loops though
[21:48:18] <raj> oh, i was picturing a loop within
[21:48:49] <Eviltwin> Everything before if(obj[valueToCheckFor]) just stays as is
[21:49:03] <Eviltwin> Then if(obj[valueToCheckFor]) and everything after goes in a loop over the options in the select
[21:49:22] <Eviltwin> Where you replace valueToCheckFor with fetching the value from the option
[21:49:26] <Eviltwin> And if the test passes, you remove it
[21:49:37] <raj> k, let me fiddle with this
[21:49:40] <raj> thank you :)
[21:50:26] <woopawoop> hey, how would one get just one img from a page that has a few dozen with no specific classes or ids? .find('#pix img').eq(1); looks for / loads all imgs
[21:51:20] <raj> is it valid to have a method obtain a key?
[21:51:26] <raj> within $.map--> function(e,i){return {$(e).val():'true'}
[21:51:53] <raj> oh wait, that's not what I wanna do
[21:51:57] <raj> nm
[21:52:01] <Eviltwin> woopawoop: If it's a few dozen, it's going to be faster than any other method
[21:52:02] <Eviltwin> The way you've written it
[21:52:26] <Eviltwin> raj: That'll build something like [{"abc": true}, {"def": true}] which is not what you want
[21:52:31] <raj> right
[21:53:02] <raj> map always makes an array
[21:53:05] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:53:37] <Eviltwin> One thing to be aware of is that $.map and $.each are a lot slower than a for or while loop
[21:53:50] <raj> oh really?
[21:53:53] <woopawoop> thanks
[21:54:03] <raj> i thought it was the other way around for $ elements
[21:54:06] <raj> good to know
[21:54:14] <Eviltwin> If you're not taking advantage of the closure properties, I suggest you just use a for loop
[21:54:21] <raj> k
[21:55:48] <Eviltwin> If you wanted to do it with a $.map, you could probably apply to a $.extend
[21:56:03] <raj> that's okay, I'll just use a for loop
[21:56:12] <Eviltwin> But that's complicated and horribly inefficient
[21:56:15] <raj> I must define an empty {} variable though, right?
[21:56:18] <Eviltwin> So, yeah, for loop
[21:56:30] <raj> can't just build the object outta the blue
[21:56:37] <raj> the way I can with an array using map/each
[21:56:44] <Eviltwin> Well the {} produces a new empty object
[21:56:55] <raj> right
[21:56:57] <Eviltwin> And you want to add these things to an empty object
[21:57:07] <raj> k
[21:57:18] <raj> i dunno why i always expect rules to be different for js
[21:57:57] <coldhead> warrant obstreperousness
[22:00:38] <jahrichie> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/TFck1f62 should that work?
[22:01:11] <Eviltwin> Probably, do you know about $(document).ready?
[22:01:22] <jahrichie> yes and no
[22:01:26] <jahrichie> i'm super new to this
[22:01:29] <infid> that means no
[22:01:30] <jahrichie> i've used it before though
[22:01:36] <jahrichie> it mean
[22:01:37] <jahrichie> s
[22:01:38] <jahrichie> i've usd it
[22:01:38] <jahrichie> a
[22:01:46] <jahrichie> nd i dont know it is, lol
[22:01:58] <infid> i've used a plane, it doesn't mean i know how it works
[22:02:08] <jahrichie> touche
[22:02:40] <infid> then again, most programmers who have used things, including entire languages, don't necessarily know how they really work
[22:02:59] <jahrichie> yeah i have no idea what i'm doing in anything really
[22:03:03] <infid> none of us really know much of anything :(
[22:03:05] <jahrichie> but i make a ton of stuff somehow !
[22:03:23] <jahrichie> no body knows anything - some famous producer
[22:04:12] <Whirl3d> nobody knows the trouble I've seen...
[22:04:12] <infid> it's kinda sad. It's mostly because this crap is made too complicated by non-standards and poor design decisions. I mean really, we're writing jquery because we don't wanna know how it all works. our grand kids will either have it worse or laugh at us for doing things so stupidly
[22:04:27] <jahrichie> okay yeah i know what that is now
[22:04:28] <jahrichie> i read
[22:04:31] <jahrichie> not for me
[22:04:46] <jahrichie> i  only want this sroll to occur when the click happens
[22:05:07] <infid> i make a lot of apps without knowing what the hell i'm doing too. i'm kinda like a special-ed kid who made some stuff with crayons
[22:05:18] <infid> and employers pay me and hang it on their corporate fridge
[22:05:36] <ngharo> heh i like that
[22:06:39] <infid> it helps that user's are dumber than programmers and don't know what they really want, so they'll use just about anything we poop out, at least for a while
[22:06:48] <coldhead> users*
[22:07:15] <infid> there was more incorrect punctuation than that, so why focus on that
[22:07:32] <coldhead> the only true knowing is knowing that you know nothing -- socrates, bill & ted's excellent adventure
[22:07:34] <infid> becauwe we only care about spelling any more :(
[22:07:40] <coldhead> all we are is dust in the wind, dude. dust. wind. dude.
[22:07:46] <ngharo> haha
[22:07:49] <infid> but if i know i know nothing then i don't really know it
[22:08:48] <ngharo> i stay up late just to read coldhead chat
[22:09:05] <coldhead> yes it's a powerful paradox, infid
[22:09:15] <infid> i just wanna be remembered. which is why i write comments in every file i write like // NEVER REMOVE. NEEDED. by infid
[22:10:05] <infid> most programmers who see that won't take the time to really be sure if it's needed or not. they'll assume there's some reason it's there and if they take it out they'll break something somewhere and don't wanna mess with that
[22:10:15] <infid> pro tip
[22:10:40] <coldhead> i might not understand the comment but i;d like leave a further comment accusing you of sins against nature
[22:10:47] <coldhead> and perhaps my cell phone number
[22:11:06] <infid> jail cell number?
[22:11:20] <coldhead> maybe later
[22:12:21] <infid> nature sins against us more than we sin against it. I mean boohoo, some smog ain't nothin compared to tsunamis, earfquakes and mosquitos
[22:12:48] <coldhead> yes it's all very frightening and intense
[22:12:51] <infid> we're evolving by going paperless and it still sends tornados to your house
[22:13:28] <infid> one day it will have nothing on us because we're so perfect and then we'll realize that it is evil and destroy it once and for all
[22:15:17] <coldhead> or we may return to a prelapsarian state of grace with a sense that nature and humanity are the same thing
[22:15:18] <coldhead> w/e
[22:16:15] <infid> some guy at work today made fun of me for using irc because his argument was that it was outdated cause it's from 1989. And I said "oh, that's right, the web was developed the other day right" and he said "good point", which is a nicer way of saying "omg you just destroyed me"
[22:25:26] <Guest18804> hello
[22:25:42] <Guest18804> hello
[22:25:55] <windsurf_> should I be able to add/remove elements from my Sortable list? As far as I can tell I'd need to redraw the list and reinitialize it again?
[22:26:10] <Guest18804> yes
[22:26:10] <Guest18804> you can
[22:26:25] <windsurf_> I tried adding an element in the chrome inspector then did .sortable('refresh') but it didn't make my new element draggable.
[22:26:39] <windsurf_> ok, good to know Guest18804  what am I missing?
[22:27:09] <windsurf_> like, should I be doing a jQuery append or some other thing? It's not documented from what I can tell
[22:29:20] <windsurf_> sorry
[22:29:21] <windsurf_> working.
[22:29:25] <windsurf_> :)
[22:29:34] <windsurf_> append is what i needed and i was using coffeescript syntax in my console :S
[22:29:36] <windsurf_> hehe
[22:29:40] <windsurf_> stoopid
[22:30:34] <coldhead> tough break
[22:42:11] <aro> anyone used uniform.js?
[22:42:32] <aro> i am running into a problem in IE9 where submit actions don't bind quite properly in some views
[22:45:58] <Cork> aro: whats "views" ?
[22:46:12] <aro> sorry, just some different html pages
[22:46:17] <Cork> ok
[22:47:17] <Cork> aro: and it doens't register at all or?
[22:47:33] <aro> no, well it renders the buttons, but when i click them - it does nothing
[22:47:52] <aro> however, if i switch it to 'Compatability mode' or 'IE8 document mode' it works fine
[22:48:28] <Cork> ?p @ aro
[22:48:33] <bot-t> aro, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:49:25] <aro> i can give you a login to see it if you want
[22:49:59] <Cork> could give it a try
[22:50:25] <Cork> might be too complext to debug it that way though
[22:50:50] <aro> at least you can see if the issue exists for you
[22:51:38] <coldhead> having to log in takes away our freedoms
[22:52:31] <aro> ?
[22:52:37] <aro> your freedoms?
[22:52:54] <Cork> aro: and wheres the submit button?
[22:53:07] <aro> APPROVE DELETE / DECLINE DELETE
[22:53:10] <aro> they are the buttons
[22:53:38] <aro> make sure you see them styled
[22:53:49] <aro> i just turned the script back on, so make sure its on for you
[23:00:42] <Cork> aro: can't really put my finger on it, but i get a feeling theres a structure error on that page
[23:00:54] <Cork> aro: have you tried running it through w3c validator?
[23:01:07] <aro> i havent yet
[23:01:09] <aro> ill do that
[23:01:51] <windsurf_> Do I have to constrain the height of my Sortable list to get dragging + auto-scrolling to work or can I somehow allow my list to grow the page size and still achieve scrolling?
[23:01:56] <windsurf_> didn't seem to work when I treid it
[23:01:58] <windsurf_> tried*
[23:10:08] <raj> Eviltwin, what are closure properties?
[23:11:05] <Eviltwin> Do you know what global and local variables are?
[23:12:14] <raj> yes
[23:12:36] <Eviltwin> How are they different?
[23:13:29] <raj> local can't be accessed outside the scope
[23:13:47] <Eviltwin> Right, they "go away" when you leave the scope
[23:13:54] <raj> ok
[23:14:05] <Eviltwin> So JavaScript has global variables and local variables
[23:14:11] <raj> indeed
[23:14:15] <Eviltwin> But also has something that most languages call "non-local variables"
[23:14:19] <Eviltwin> Which is in between
[23:14:28] <Eviltwin> JavaScript lets you define function inside other functions
[23:14:36] <raj> right
[23:14:37] <Eviltwin> As I'm sure you've run into
[23:14:56] <Eviltwin> A function has access to all the variables its parent has access to as well as its own variables
[23:15:21] <Eviltwin> The difference between its own variables and its parent's variables
[23:15:29] <Eviltwin> Is that it's parent's variables are persistant
[23:15:36] <Eviltwin> They stay the same between function calls
[23:15:48] <ndss56> Eviltwin: odd
[23:16:15] <raj> if the inner function is called multiple times within the outter function?
[23:16:43] <raj> do you mean function expressions?
[23:16:54] <Cork> actually it doesn't even have to be called from the outer function
[23:17:19] <aro> cork: you were right... <form> was wrapped in a <p>
[23:17:21] <aro> :) thanks!
[23:17:31] <aro> who knew?
[23:17:37] <Eviltwin> raj: Here's an example of it in action: http://jsfiddle.net/ZJtW2/
[23:18:15] <Cork> aro: from a quick eval i got over 600 errors from that page
[23:18:24] <Eviltwin> raj: Take a look at the console
[23:18:35] <aro> Cork: thats because i had a repeating element that had id=""
[23:18:44] <Cork> ya
[23:18:50] <aro> so i removed that, and it got errors down to 2
[23:18:51] <aro> :)
[23:18:57] <Cork> :)
[23:19:11] <aro> one of those errors was a <style> tag in place, and the other was the <p> around the form
[23:19:14] <aro> so all is well :)
[23:19:17] <aro> thanks again!
[23:19:23] <Cork> np
[23:19:31] <raj> how good is this guy
[23:19:32] <raj> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itypdYn77fM
[23:21:24] <raj> Eviltwin, that's a cool example
[23:21:27] <raj> how is that happening?
[23:21:54] <Eviltwin> raj: When I call counter(3), the "var n" is created and set to 3
[23:22:05] <Eviltwin> When I create that function inside, it keeps a reference to that n
[23:22:08] <raj> what the hell
[23:22:12] <raj> it's like some pseudo class
[23:22:17] <Eviltwin> Kinda
[23:22:30] <Eviltwin> When this is done in Java, it's typically done with anonymous classes
[23:23:18] <raj> so you run the function with 3
[23:23:28] <raj> n then = 3
[23:23:41] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:23:46] <Eviltwin> Now that inside function
[23:23:46] <raj> and returning 4
[23:23:57] <Eviltwin> The "n" refers to the "n" in the parent
[23:24:06] <Eviltwin> And that variable doesn't got away
[23:24:08] <raj> right
[23:24:12] <Eviltwin> The child can change its value
[23:24:13] <raj> how does it not go away?
[23:24:35] <Eviltwin> Because JavaScript is a language with garbage collection
[23:24:47] <Eviltwin> And every variable is allocated like with "new" in Java
[23:25:00] <Eviltwin> And when it's no longer in use, it gets garbage collected
[23:25:23] <raj> do you delete variables?
[23:25:35] <raj> or you just trust js will do the right thing?
[23:25:38] <Cork> s/in use/referenced/
[23:25:39] <Eviltwin> JS will do the right thing
[23:26:02] <raj> wait, back to the script, this just blew my mind
[23:26:10] <raj> so...can we continue tracing it?
[23:26:22] <raj> you return a function that increments n
[23:26:37] <DreamStiffler> hi guys...i suck at programming. So i just wanna know how to solve this question. I have a table which generates data in each rows of TR. What i need to do once this datas generated is , for every 10 datas displayed i need to close the table and create another table opening (table,tr,td) and the data continues to display. So how do i do this? Basically im trying to create a paging solution for datas of hundreds.
[23:26:46] <raj> but there's no loop
[23:27:00] <raj> so where is this value for n being stored?
[23:27:03] <raj> there's no global
[23:28:04] <Eviltwin> Right, it's a non-local
[23:28:04] <DreamStiffler> sorry raj like i said my programming sucks
[23:28:10] <DreamStiffler> so i need to read for loop?
[23:28:23] <Eviltwin> So it doesn't go away but it not accessable from global scope
[23:28:31] <DreamStiffler> the dynamic data that is being created in each TR is already a loop
[23:28:33] <raj> DreamStiffler, was talking to Eviltwin
[23:28:39] <DreamStiffler> ok
[23:28:57] <raj> Eviltwin, then how is it accessed?
[23:29:03] <Cork> raj: counter creates n, and an anonymus function it then returns the function to the caller, that stors the function in a variable; THAT variable keeps n alive
[23:29:05] <raj> only when within that fnuction
[23:29:06] <raj> ok
[23:29:09] <raj> that's pretty cool
[23:29:18] <raj> so I can use a function sorta like a class
[23:29:32] <raj> and the method for doing this is a function within a function?
[23:29:43] <raj> any function within a function?
[23:30:06] <Cork> you need to return the function
[23:30:10] <Eviltwin> Every time a function is called, new variables are allocated
[23:30:18] <Eviltwin> All of the variables used inside the function
[23:30:34] <Eviltwin> One copy of them is made per function call
[23:30:40] <Eviltwin> Now counter() is called once for x and once for y
[23:30:52] <Eviltwin> The function inside ends up getting called multiple times
[23:31:34] <Eviltwin> They act on the same n
[23:31:50] <Eviltwin> One n for the call that goes into x and one n for the call that goes into y
[23:32:12] <raj> nice
[23:32:17] <raj> so I just have to return a function
[23:32:21] <Eviltwin> Functions calls are the only thing make new copies of variables
[23:32:26] <raj> cuz then the function gets stored
[23:32:35] <Eviltwin> So if I have a for loop
[23:32:47] <Eviltwin> Like for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }
[23:32:47] <raj> so now x = that function
[23:32:56] <Eviltwin> raj: Exactly
[23:33:03] <Eviltwin> The for loop makes only one "i" there
[23:33:13] <Eviltwin> Which means any references inside refer to the same "i"
[23:33:19] <raj> and everytime x is called, it'll run that function
[23:33:23] <Eviltwin> This is where $.each can come in handy
[23:33:24] <Eviltwin> raj: Yup
[23:33:31] <Eviltwin> raj: Consider this example: http://jsfiddle.net/eRdzM/
[23:33:37] <raj> why doesn't var n = start reset it?
[23:33:47] <Eviltwin> raj: Because that code doesn't run again :D
[23:33:55] <Eviltwin> Only the function I returned that only does n++
[23:34:28] <raj> why doesn't the code run again if a function is called?
[23:34:33] <raj> it fetches it from memory?
[23:34:43] <Eviltwin> Let me rework it real quick here
[23:35:36] <Cork> raj: you have two function, counter creates another function, and returns that; then you have a local variable pointing to the inner function, not the counter one
[23:36:30] <raj> cuz it's like running counter(3)() for the first one
[23:36:38] <Cork> yes
[23:36:41] <raj> nice
[23:36:47] <Cork> its like a reverce callback system
[23:37:01] <raj> u guys rock
[23:37:03] <raj> thank you
[23:37:58] <coldhead> a reverse callback system... mind blown
[23:38:07] <Cork> :)
[23:38:07] <coldhead> callforward?
[23:38:14] <raj> haha
[23:38:16] <raj> +1
[23:38:16] <Cork> ya :)
[23:38:18] <Eviltwin> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/ZJtW2/3/
[23:38:51] <Eviltwin> This is kind of mindblowing
[23:39:11] <Eviltwin> JavaScript's scoping seems a lot like C and Java until you get to stuff like this
[23:39:31] <Eviltwin> Then you realize there's actually a lot more going on
[23:39:49] <raj> i guess in the others you can't return a function
[23:39:53] <raj> i dunno abou javascript
[23:39:56] <raj> i mean java
[23:40:35] <Eviltwin> No but you can accomplish a similar outcome by building an anonymous class inside another method
[23:40:43] <Eviltwin> It's a lot messier in my opinion
[23:40:48] * coldhead throws up in his mouth
[23:40:53] <Eviltwin> But stricter
[23:40:54] <coldhead> first class function ftw
[23:43:17] <raj> what the hell was my original question?
[23:43:22] <raj> ::scrolling up::
[23:43:30] <Cork> lol
[23:43:31] <Eviltwin> What is closure
[23:43:41] <Eviltwin> This behavior is called closure
[23:43:45] <Cork> closure properties
[23:43:59] <raj> aah, yes
[23:44:27] <Eviltwin> So here's an example of closure in action: http://jsfiddle.net/eRdzM/
[23:44:33] <raj> this behavior is called closure, when I keep a non-local variable alive?
[23:44:35] <Eviltwin> Why $.each can be useful
[23:44:59] <Eviltwin> raj: Yes, closure is when the variables from a parent function are preserved in this manner
[23:46:11] <raj> what's this object you're passing $()?
[23:46:24] <Eviltwin> You mean $.each(names, ...) ?
[23:46:51] <raj> {"type":"button","value":names[i]
[23:46:57] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry
[23:47:12] <raj> you mean to say I can just pass an object and it'll add those attributes on?
[23:47:22] <Eviltwin> That's another way of writing $("<input type='button' value='"+names[i]+"'>")
[23:47:25] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:47:32] <raj> i like it
[23:47:42] <Eviltwin> Also say one of the names was "O'Brien'
[23:47:43] <raj> that <input> through me off too
[23:47:57] <Eviltwin> "<input type='button' value='"+names[i]+"'>" would produce "<input type='button' value='O'Brien'>"
[23:48:02] <Eviltwin> Which is an error
[23:48:04] <Eviltwin> Mismatched quotes
[23:48:19] <Eviltwin> Using the object notation prevents that error
[23:48:21] <raj> ya
[23:48:30] <Eviltwin> $("<input>") makes a new input element
[23:48:36] <raj> yeah, anything that'll avoid me using + sign's in the middle of the selector
[23:48:51] <Eviltwin> This notation is specific to constructing new elements
[23:48:56] <raj> ok
[23:49:08] <Eviltwin> It's documented here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery
[23:49:30] <Eviltwin> Under the heading "jQuery( html [, ownerDocument] )"
[23:50:34] <raj> there was somewhere else in my code I was able to pass an object
[23:50:42] <raj> i'm actually curious where I used it now
[23:55:39] <q_a_z_steve> is it possible to use jquery (or should I use something else) to make text rain down the screen of a webpage, SORT OF like the matrix? I don't want a flash app in the middle of an already jquery page...
[23:57:30] <Eviltwin> q_a_z_steve: Depends on what precisely you're looking for
[23:58:27] <q_a_z_steve> I don't like the current things I am finding, a black box which spells something out, I just want 1's and 0's to rain from an image (I'll have to figure out how to keep it under the image no matter the browser size too).
[23:58:58] <raj> aah, to .data()
[23:59:20] <raj> Eviltwin, that's another nice example
[23:59:35] <Eviltwin> raj: Do you understand how/why it works the way it does?
[23:59:44] <raj> so why doesn't `i` increment for the first one?
[23:59:49] <raj> nope
