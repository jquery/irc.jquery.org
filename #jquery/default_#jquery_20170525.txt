[05:11:10] <snfgf> hi
[05:17:25] <Vas232> Hello, need your help.. I would like to know if there a way to replace a word/string inside of element by character index position? (posted also my problem here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44176421/replacing-words-by-index-position)
[08:41:00] <JrWebDev> $(".myClass").hide(); wont work on a div container inside a div child but it works on the container/parent
[08:41:50] <JrWebDev> <div class="container"><div class="inside">hi</div></div> it wont work on .inside but works on .container
[08:42:06] <toomin> Is the child dynamically added?
[08:42:19] <JrWebDev> no its hard coded in html
[08:42:33] <JrWebDev> well its a form and its using laravel helpers but the div is pure html
[08:43:19] <JrWebDev> <div><div> {!! form::label('greeting', "Hi") !!} </div></div>
[08:44:02] <Woet> JrWebDev: www.jsfiddle.net
[08:44:04] <JrWebDev> thats all i know
[08:44:57] <toomin> hm
[08:45:03] <toomin> No class names initially?
[08:45:15] <toomin> Jsfiddle would help
[08:45:37] <toomin> Can you debug at the .hide() line and see what the jquery selector returns?
[08:46:28] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/rwbvdm45/
[08:48:05] <Uhkis> JrWebDev: include jquery and that works just fine
[08:48:20] <JrWebDev> i believe it is included
[08:48:27] <JrWebDev> it works on zip_container class
[08:55:52] <JrWebDev> im dumb
[08:57:06] <JrWebDev> forgot that i had multiple copies of the same form and an if statement selects a form from the multiple that i have...gotta give the form the same class
[08:57:23] <JrWebDev> all forms the same class and now it works
[08:58:39] <JrWebDev> thanks for your help guys Woet toothe  Uhkis
[09:03:48] <snfgf> hello
[09:04:00] <snfgf> can someboyd explain why this doesn't do, what it looks like it should do.
[09:04:01] <snfgf> https://jsfiddle.net/50wL7mdz/35940/
[09:36:21] <lng> Hi! How may I refer 'filter[platform]' from a values object? https://jsfiddle.net/2rgcrguo/
[09:48:23] <alexidoia> hi
[09:48:59] <alexidoia> stupid question but I can't remember, when you are using $(this) how do you target a child element of this.
[09:51:52] <JrWebDev> whats the best way to save the data inputted into input boxes in forms when user post submits. i dont want users having to input the same data again if theirs an error
[09:51:53] <alexidoia> anyone ?
[09:52:40] <alexidoia> JrWebDev: the web server which produce the form at the first place is also responsible to fill it in
[09:53:08] <JrWebDev> yeah
[09:53:11] <JrWebDev> figured too
[09:53:19] <JrWebDev> okay theres no easy way hehe
[09:53:20] <JrWebDev> thanks
[09:53:55] <alexidoia> no safest way
[09:55:43] <Uhkis> alexidoia: .find()
[09:56:06] <alexidoia> Uhkis: thanks
[09:56:38] <JrWebDev> how do i validate an input box using regex
[09:57:28] <Uhkis> JrWebDev: $(elem).val().match() probably
[09:58:24] <JrWebDev> thanks
[10:00:47] <alexidoia> what would be the handler opposite to hover, so when the mouse quits the element ?
[10:02:09] <JrWebDev> how do you add an attribute such as <input class="myBox" disabled>  how would i add disabled
[10:04:19] <localh0st> alexidoia: 'blur' or even 'mouseout'
[10:04:44] <alexidoia> localh0st: thanks
[10:04:58] <localh0st> JrWebDev: $(el).attr("disabled", true);
[10:05:21] <localh0st> or: prop("disabled", true), i dont remeber
[10:07:00] <JrWebDev> thanks man works for me
[10:07:07] <JrWebDev> first one
[10:52:13] <Duikb00t-home> hi
[10:56:06] <JrWebDev> how would you .live or .on all forms input boxes...if all inputs have .error then submit button is btn-danger if all input have no .error btn-success
[11:03:52] <whoisaCe> hey guys, I know how to do this in jquery, but having a bit of issues doing it in javascript, what am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/gmw7yd4x/ - can't ask in javascript, not signed in or w.e
[11:08:30] <whoisaCe> Sorry the issue here is that the headline gets added to the bottom of parent div
[11:08:37] <whoisaCe> instead of before
[11:11:27] <JrWebDev> anyway to document.on('any and all events', function() {} ???
[11:15:20] <whoisaCe> JrWebDev: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5848598/how-can-i-bind-all-events-on-a-dom-element
[11:15:31] <whoisaCe> the second answer looks close to what you're looking for no?
[11:15:55] <whoisaCe> disregard
[11:19:50] <JrWebDev> is there a quick way to .on() on all input boxes within a page?
[11:20:29] <JrWebDev> or must should i put a class on all input forms and then $(".InputBoxes").on()
[11:21:05] <JrWebDev> $(".InputBoxes").on('input', function() { do whatever; })
[11:22:54] <Duikb00t-home> hi
[12:02:16] <phlix> Trying to build something where I can add a field and delete a field. Was using a number to try and keep track of it but it seems I must be doing it wrong or in a bad way. There has to be an easier way to accomplish this. Would anyone mind taking a look at what I have? https://jsfiddle.net/qut2h3tb/
[12:15:55] <taplar> add room doesn't seem to be adding a room, just showing a hidden one
[12:17:07] <taplar> likewise the remove is just hiding rooms
[12:22:49] <phlix> Yea, its just hidding and unhiding.
[12:23:06] <phlix> that is how it needs to be. But if you remove the middle room or the first room instead of the last room it seems to break the flow
[12:23:41] <taplar> instead of showing a particular one, you could try to show the first hidden one
[12:23:59] <phlix> I am not quite sure the best way to do that.
[12:24:43] <taplar> $('.is-hidden').first().removeClass('is-hidden')
[12:24:46] <phlix> just feels that the way I am going about this is wrong.
[12:24:55] <phlix> ohh ic
[12:25:22] <taplar> you really don't need a room count
[12:25:32] <taplar> you can base your logic off of $('.is-hidden').length
[12:25:52] <taplar> if you know there are only three rooms
[12:26:32] <phlix> 3 will be the max possible rooms
[12:26:40] <phlix> and then have to have at least 1
[12:27:04] <phlix> Yea, trying to keep count seems to be really complicated with the different possibilities
[12:27:07] <taplar> so if $('.is-hidden').length == 2, don't hide the last room
[12:31:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qut2h3tb/1/
[12:32:11] <phlix> k let me look.. thanks for your help so far!
[12:58:49] <phlix> taplar: your the man!! thanks so much!
[13:06:11] <taplar> np
[13:18:09] <ezcal> Is there a way to trigger my $(document).ready() function to run again when I add/remove elements on my page?
[13:18:26] <JrWebDev> why does .on('mousemove') always work but .on('load') or $document.ready() never execute
[13:18:46] <taplar> ezcal: put it in a function that is named
[13:19:07] <taplar> $document.ready() looks weird
[13:19:13] <ezcal> Oh, yeah duh.
[13:19:14] <taplar> it should be $(document).ready()
[13:19:14] <ezcal> Thank you!
[13:19:20] <Violinist> is it valid to have try inside a try
[13:19:25] <taplar> and the load event only happen on certain elements
[13:19:31] <taplar> Violinist: sure
[13:19:41] <taplar> syntactically it doesn't care
[13:22:34] <Akuw> i am getting this error   jQuery.Deferred exception: test.size is not a function
[13:23:00] <taplar> what is 'test'?
[13:42:30] <hellyeah> yo
[13:43:21] <taplar> g'day
[13:44:08] <hellyeah> how goes?
[13:44:22] <taplar> it's alright
[13:45:51] <hellyeah> it is decent i have a code which is really long. Just thinking how i can make it better, faster
[13:48:30] <hellyeah> care to look http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/smzz2vvk/ this is really long if you dont have time to spare, i can understand it.
[13:51:17] <hellyeah> when you create datepickers with plus and select a date from "from" and "to". You will see some slow progress. Please select date in wide range like 26 may - 15 june or something. If you have time to look at
[13:53:46] <taplar> yeah, you got issues there.  you killed my chrome
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> trying to figure out why it takes so long?
[13:54:23] <taplar> my cpu was hanging around 13%
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> which function is responsible for that date range stuff?
[13:54:27] <taplar> just for chrome
[13:55:04] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you familiar with your profiler?
[13:55:05] <hellyeah> me
[13:55:14] <hellyeah> i kill your chrome
[13:55:15] <hellyeah> :D
[13:55:30] <hellyeah> what is profiler?
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> you using chrome?
[13:55:41] <hellyeah> yes
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools.
[13:56:02] <robertmaxrees> click "performance"
[13:56:51] <robertmaxrees> hit the red circle on the upper left, do the thing that performs poorly, and when it finishes click "stop"
[13:57:27] <hellyeah> which one should i choose?
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> which one what?
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> also: holy shit your code is working really hard.
[13:58:14] <taplar> lol
[13:58:17] <hellyeah> i click profiles
[13:58:31] <hellyeah> dont have performance tab
[13:58:44] <hellyeah> what do you mean "working really hard" ?
[13:58:45] <robertmaxrees> in your chrome dev tools?
[13:59:00] <hellyeah> ye
[13:59:41] <hellyeah> i have elements, console, sources, network, timeline, profiles, application, secÄ±rity, audits
[13:59:42] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/pReuGEP.png
[13:59:54] <robertmaxrees> erm, how old is your copy?
[14:00:18] <hellyeah> you mean version of chrome?
[14:00:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:00:52] <hellyeah> 57.0.2987..
[14:01:23] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:01:26] <hellyeah> is it old?
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> newp - that should show it.
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://i.imgur.com/z9W4AiF.png
[14:02:37] <robertmaxrees> what does that screenshot tell you?
[14:03:31] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  https://itsosticky.com/1u3sshm
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> weird - yeah, record js cpu profile.
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> or just look at the screenshot i shared.
[14:04:45] <hellyeah> obviously i cannot see imgue link here
[14:04:53] <taplar> shit ton of redraws
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not obvious to me.
[14:05:01] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:05:23] <hellyeah> :D
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> but your code is working real hard.  colorizingCalendar is calling refreshSingleCalendar a few times, each of which does a whole lot of redraws.
[14:05:56] <hellyeah> i got performance chart
[14:06:53] <robertmaxrees> cal.jqxCalendar('addSpecialDate', date, 'special' + specialNum, jsonDataforTooltipofCalendar(jsonArray)); this function is where your slowdown starts.
[14:08:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:08:21] <hellyeah> it is slow because of "redraw" issue?
[14:08:56] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to highlight a range of dates selected?
[14:09:03] <hellyeah> but that line is to key to success the certain task
[14:09:23] <hellyeah> yeah when you select two dates you will see above calendar will be colorized
[14:09:34] <hellyeah> i need to colorize both dates and days between
[14:10:01] <robertmaxrees> they hjave a range selection option you should be using instead.
[14:10:02] <hellyeah> and when you hove the colorized dates you will see related tooltip
[14:10:04] <taplar> datepicker has methods you can give it to do that
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxcalendar/index.htm#demos/jqxcalendar/rangeselection.htm
[14:10:41] <hellyeah> taplar:  what methods btw
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you a link to the docs for it...
[14:10:58] <robertmaxrees> can you not see that either?
[14:11:08] <hellyeah> i see now
[14:11:11] <hellyeah> D
[14:11:15] <robertmaxrees> use that instead.
[14:11:47] <robertmaxrees> i'll be that works better.
[14:12:49] <hellyeah> guess you mean "special dates"
[14:13:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:13:48] <taplar> i see a large performance gain by removing one line
[14:13:53] <taplar> date = new Date(date)
[14:14:04] <hellyeah> which line is that?
[14:14:09] <taplar> i don't eve know what that is doing
[14:14:31] <hellyeah> let me check
[14:14:47] <robertmaxrees> heh, that actually won't resolve his issue fwiw.
[14:15:11] <taplar> right, but it did cut down on my performance time
[14:15:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:15:21] <taplar> and it doesn't really make sense anyway
[14:15:24] <robertmaxrees> didn't have a material impact for me.
[14:15:33] <hellyeah> i guess it is for reinitializing the date with current date
[14:15:37] <robertmaxrees> just as an aside.
[14:15:55] <taplar> that's not what that does man
[14:16:05] <taplar> you are giving it a date object as the input
[14:16:22] <taplar> which you already have a date object
[14:16:25] <taplar> so...
[14:17:26] <hellyeah> hmm i just thouÄ±ght i reinitialized the date object with new date. It is inside while loop so date will be one next day hmm let me check how thing goes here
[14:18:06] <taplar> lol, if it -did- get the current date again, you'd be stuck in an infinite loop
[14:18:10] <robertmaxrees> youi'll notice that the performance graph doesn't show that as being the primaryu culprit.
[14:18:21] <robertmaxrees> *shrug*
[14:18:32] <hellyeah> culprit?
[14:18:57] <taplar> cause of the problem
[14:19:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  did you select the dates after removing that line?
[14:20:34] <hellyeah> because when you remove that line it just colorize the last date that you select from "to". For ex 1 June - 5 June you will see only 5 June is colorized
[14:20:35] <taplar> yep, for me in ff it cut down the time by a lot.  it's still doing a ton of reflows though
[14:21:08] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i concerned i used special dates feature with addspecial date function i will take a close look
[14:21:53] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes it is faster now but the problem is it wont color all dates it just color last date
[14:22:44] <taplar> ok, so regardless of that, take a look at roberts suggestion
[14:23:49] <hellyeah> i try to figure out redrawing issue
[14:24:04] <hellyeah> did you mean redrawing whole calendar again and again?
[14:25:16] <octo8> hello, we set a text like this modal.find('.modal-body .placelink a').text(link); ... how do i change an image ? thanks.
[14:25:51] <taplar> octo8: change how?
[14:26:29] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees, taplar thanks for sparing time with me btw i appreciated
[14:26:34] <octo8> taplar: i mean, in the example above, i changed the text of link, how to change image source ?
[14:27:02] <hellyeah> you want to change image source after clicking something?
[14:27:06] <taplar> the same way
[14:27:12] <taplar> err, sorry, missread
[14:27:25] <taplar> you target the img and then change the prop('src', newValue)
[14:28:33] * octo8 tries
[14:28:42] <hellyeah> is it possible to keep image source in an object like source : image1, source: image2 etc. and then you just look up next index when you do click event or something?
[14:29:31] <taplar> keys have to be unique to an object
[14:29:45] <taplar> it'd have to be an array.
[14:30:38] <hellyeah> oh yeah
[14:30:42] <hellyeah> key must be unique
[14:30:47] <hellyeah> sorry about that
[14:32:23] <octo8> taplar: modal.find('.modal-body .placeimage img').prop('src', image); works .... but
[14:32:40] <hellyeah> octo8:  i would suggest to use jsfiddle
[14:33:20] <octo8> but why when i pass ...... data-image="/images/harley.jpg" .... then image url is  ....... http://localhost/images/harley.jpg
[14:33:47] <taplar> i can't access your localhost bro, :)
[14:34:08] <hellyeah> octo8:
[14:34:09] <hellyeah> :D
[14:34:29] <hellyeah> octo8:  use this https://itsosticky.com/
[14:34:48] <taplar> instead, lets talk about what is going on
[14:34:56] <taplar> you are passing in 'image'.  what is that?
[14:35:08] <octo8> my question is , why when i pass the path /images/harley.jpg it goes to localhost instead of current folder, this is my question !!
[14:35:41] <taplar> put a . in front of the /
[14:35:47] * octo8 tries
[14:36:01] <taplar> you're are doing a relative path.  relative path rules apply
[14:36:57] <octo8> taplar: "./images/harley.jpg" is not working too :(
[14:37:17] <taplar> right click on the broken image, what url is it saying it's trying to go do, and also what is the url in the browsers?
[14:39:06] <taplar> though really this is kinda getting off topic of jquery now
[14:39:10] <octo8> Ø®Ù†
[14:39:12] <octo8> ok
[14:39:15] <octo8> nevermind
[14:39:36] <octo8> but i think it is caused by jquery, as html treats paths as local
[14:39:46] <taplar> which is not javascript
[14:39:52] <taplar> that's how your browser treats urls
[14:40:08] <taplar> it will be relative to the url in your browser
[14:40:27] <hellyeah> octo8:  you should upload an image to web site i gave and you write some simple codes in jsfiddle. People can help you better
[14:40:33] <taplar> so you just need to make sure the base path of the page you are looking at, transforms correctly to the relative path you are giving the image
[14:41:24] <taplar> if you are at http://localhost and looking at a page, such as index, that corresponds to whatever directory index is in
[14:41:31] <taplar> ./whatever would start in that directory
[14:43:37] <taplar> if you are at http://localhost/subdirectory , ./whatever would start in that directory instead.
[15:06:25] <abakedapplepie> hey guys, o hppe this is okay to ask here. I am using a jquery plugin called Chosen, but it doesnt appear to work very well on Safari on iOS. Does anyone have any alternative plugins that accomplish a similar effect? https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/ I am using the "Multiple Select" function
[15:07:25] <taplar> have you looked at Select2?
[15:08:42] <abakedapplepie> i have not, thanks. looks perfect, will test it out
[15:09:40] <abakedapplepie> glorious, it works, thanks taplar
[15:09:50] <taplar> awesome
[15:10:13] <abakedapplepie> somewhat related aside, is there a good resource or repo for finding jquery plugins?
[15:10:32] <abakedapplepie> i always seem to get halfway through something before i realize i am reinventing the wheel
[15:10:44] <taplar> uh, maybe?  usually i just google
[15:11:02] <taplar> http://plugins.jquery.com/
[15:13:38] <octo8> taplar: you were not right, i used these to handle jquery urls , ... var loc = window.location.pathname;var dir = loc.substring(0, loc.lastIndexOf('/')); ...
[15:13:46] <octo8> now works
[15:14:19] <taplar> ok?  none of that is jquery
[15:14:31] <octo8> it's js
[15:14:36] <taplar> right
[15:15:18] <taplar> and that doesn't really negate what i said about how browsers handle relative path urls
[15:17:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://select2.github.io/
[15:17:31] <hellyeah> is that whay you told earlier?
[15:17:58] <taplar> yeah
[15:18:34] <hellyeah> nice !
[15:18:54] <hellyeah> this is in cloudflare
[15:19:13] <hellyeah> we just dont have net on bank but i just force them to open cloudflare
[15:19:19] <hellyeah> i can test it out at work
[15:20:08] <hellyeah> can i use it instead of dropdown?
[15:20:22] <matte0> Hi everyone. What is the best way to find the first multidimensional array key that matches a given date?
[15:20:22] <taplar> it's an alternative, sure
[15:20:40] <hellyeah> placeholder seems handy
[15:20:47] <taplar> matte0: can you give more context?
[15:21:02] <taplar> hellyeah: normal dropdowns have placeholders already, same with inputs
[15:21:56] <hellyeah> matte0:  seems you need iteration?
[15:22:48] <matte0> taplar: I have a multidimenional array of seminars (date, title description), and I want to return the first three that have a date equal to or greater than today's date
[15:23:29] <matte0> hellyeah: yes, I probably do
[15:24:18] <matte0> my thinking is that if I can find the key of the first array element that is >= Date(), then I can simply increment the key for the next two items
[15:24:28] <taplar> so i have more questions
[15:24:38] <taplar> because in js, array keys are integers, not dates
[15:24:52] <taplar> anything else your doing more of an object with keys
[15:24:55] <hellyeah> seems object you need
[15:25:08] <hellyeah> sorry for interference
[15:25:32] <taplar> can you show us in a fiddle or paste or something how your multidimensional array is structured?
[15:26:09] <matte0> hopefully this is legible, but it's the first array element
[15:26:11] <matte0> var seminars = {'row1' : { 'date' : '2017-3-23', 'title' : 'Spring Break', 'description' : 'no seminar scheduled' },
[15:26:22] <taplar> alright!
[15:26:28] <taplar> you got objects, :)  not arrays
[15:26:48] <taplar> [] <-- this is an array
[15:26:50] <matte0> lol, ok...sorry, I know PHP better, but I can't use it for this project/server
[15:27:09] <matte0> is it better for me to work with an array vs an objects?
[15:27:25] <taplar> no, since you have defined keys here, objects are the way to go
[15:27:55] <matte0> in this case, would row1 be equivalent to seminars[0]? or is that only an array thing?
[15:27:57] <taplar> ok, so you are wanting to go through seminars and find the first object that has a date equal to or larger than a given date?
[15:28:05] <taplar> no, that's array notation
[15:28:23] <matte0> yes, that is correct. I have a full list of seminars, but only want to display info from 3 at a time on the page
[15:28:23] <taplar> seminars.row1 would reference the inner object.  or seminars['row1']
[15:28:25] <robertmaxrees> err, [] is object propertyt access notation, of which array indices are as well.  but using a number is for arrays.
[15:29:00] <matte0> but I need to make sure that it only includes seminars that are taking place on the current date, or in the future
[15:29:16] <matte0> thank you all for the clarification on objects vs arrays in js...I feel dumb :)
[15:29:27] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, taplar is right - you'd need to loop through all of 'em and manually compare the keys.
[15:29:39] <hellyeah> matte0:  better to use jsfiddle on that matter
[15:30:10] <hellyeah> i think you can do row[i][date] am i wrong?
[15:30:18] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah he can't do that.
[15:30:20] <hellyeah> or row[i].date
[15:30:25] <robertmaxrees> the key names are the dates.
[15:30:34] <hellyeah> oh sorry my bad
[15:30:34] <taplar> i'm trying to figure out if i want to point him towards Object.keys or $.each
[15:30:35] <robertmaxrees> oh, date is a property.
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[15:30:41] <robertmaxrees> var seminars = {'row1' : { 'date' :
[15:30:41] <robertmaxrees> '2017-3-23', 'title' : 'Spring Break', 'description' : 'no
[15:30:41] <robertmaxrees> seminar scheduled' },
[15:31:07] <robertmaxrees> so your seminars object has a set of properties whose keynames are "row1", "row2", etc?
[15:31:17] <matte0> correct
[15:31:36] <robertmaxrees> heh, so then you're basically trying to use an array.
[15:31:47] <robertmaxrees> why not just an array of seminar objects
[15:31:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:32:06] <hellyeah> array of object
[15:32:14] <hellyeah> instead of object of object
[15:32:17] <hellyeah> ?
[15:32:18] <matte0> I thought I was using a seminar, being the neophyte that I am
[15:32:24] <matte0> *thought I was using arrays
[15:32:52] <robertmaxrees> nah, youi're probably thinmking of associative arrays.
[15:33:01] <robertmaxrees> which JS doesn't really have,.
[15:33:36] <matte0> ok, thank you for the information
[15:33:53] <matte0> so it sounds like I should reformat my seminars object as an array?
[15:34:00] <robertmaxrees> matte0 taplar I'd probably use an array here instead.
[15:34:09] <robertmaxrees> then you get all the array methods that would make this stupid easy.
[15:34:28] <taplar> true
[15:34:49] <robertmaxrees> the keynames for each object really don't have any special meaning other than to denote an index.
[15:34:55] <matte0> correct
[15:35:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so skip the keynames and just use an array instead.
[15:35:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wgxr9hwf/
[15:35:59] <matte0> ok, thank you, I will do that now
[15:36:35] <robertmaxrees> also: I'd HIGHLY suggest using momentjs to handle the date comparisons.
[15:36:47] <hellyeah> momentjs is cool
[15:39:19] <matte0> I will look into it!
[15:44:29] <taplar> my jokes reference past jokes.  i'm like a deferred
[15:48:39] <Akuw> i am getting this error, but only in firefox
[15:48:40] <Akuw> getPreventDefault() está desaprobado
[15:49:03] <taplar> what?
[15:49:52] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19175218/use-of-getpreventdefault-is-deprecated-use-defaultprevented-instead#19175930
[15:50:11] <taplar> didn't even know that was a thing
[15:50:34] <Akuw> El uso de getPreventDefault() está desaprobado. Use en su lugar defaultPrevented.
[15:51:05] <taplar> uh, tu habla engles?
[15:54:16] <Akuw> yes
[15:54:20] <Akuw> and spanish
[15:56:10] <taplar> so according to that stackoverflow page, getPreventDefault() is deprecated in firefox
[16:02:01] <robertmaxrees> Akuw you can safely ignore that iirc.
[16:11:58] <PettanShoutaKun> I have a $('#someElement').on('load', someFunction);
[16:12:17] <PettanShoutaKun> if I want to remove that on unload do I do $('#someElement').off('load', someFunction);
[16:12:18] <taplar> what is the element?
[16:12:25] <PettanShoutaKun> or do I want like $('#someElement').on('unload', someFunction);
[16:12:28] <PettanShoutaKun> it's an iFrame
[16:12:34] <taplar> you can use off(), yes
[16:12:52] <robertmaxrees> PettanShoutaKun you .on('unload' and .off('loadl do two different things.
[16:12:56] <PettanShoutaKun> is the event still 'load' though, or is it 'unload'?
[16:13:04] <robertmaxrees> one removes a handler, the other listens for an event.
[16:13:46] <taplar> you give it the event you want to remove the event handler from
[16:14:09] <PettanShoutaKun> I see... that is interesting....
[16:14:13] <PettanShoutaKun> now I have to think about this
[16:14:53] <PettanShoutaKun> I'm trying to pair that with this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2482059/disable-f5-and-browser-refresh-using-javascript
[16:15:19] <PettanShoutaKun> basically when the frame is loaded I want to create a bind that intercepts the refresh event and causes it to only reload the iframe instead of the greater parent page
[16:15:32] <PettanShoutaKun> when the page is unloaded it should remove this binding
[16:16:37] <PettanShoutaKun> so I probably want an on('load', add key bindings   an on('unload', remove keybindings .... and then a function thhat those functions bind and undbind
[16:16:45] <taplar> if they hit F5 on the outer page, you want it to refresh the iframe only?
[16:17:45] <PettanShoutaKun> yes
[16:18:01] <taplar> and what are you putting the unload binding on?
[16:18:12] <PettanShoutaKun> the same iframe
[16:18:25] <taplar> would you not put it on the outer page?
[16:18:42] <PettanShoutaKun> maybe... I guess it really depends on how the frame is unloaded
[16:18:47] <PettanShoutaKun> if it's unloaded
[16:19:09] <PettanShoutaKun> the problem is we have a horrible ugly behemoth of software that's like angularJS with 3 different iFrames
[16:19:15] <PettanShoutaKun> and then angular2 bootstraped on top of that
[16:20:13] <PettanShoutaKun> when you look at something in one of the iframes and refresh the page right now it refreshes the outer page but the iframe is lost so you end up with a navigation outer page that refreshes to an empty iframe in the middle of the page
[16:23:57] <taplar> i'm doing `window.onbeforeunload = function(e){ return false; };` in the console while on jquery.com and it is still letting me refresh the page, after a confirmation
[16:24:42] <taplar> that S.O. post you linked suggested cancelling the keydown button
[16:26:14] <PettanShoutaKun> isn't onbeforeunload a separate event from keydown?
[16:26:36] <taplar> yeah, but that's what i'm saying.  the users are still able to refresh with that logic, just after a confirmation
[16:29:12] <PettanShoutaKun_> I think that broke my browser....
[16:29:27] <taplar> heh
[16:30:10] <PettanShoutaKun_> jquery.js:3 Uncaught TypeError: ((n.event.special[g.origType] || (intermediate value)).handle || g.handler).apply is not a function     at HTMLIFrameElement.dispatch
[16:30:12] <PettanShoutaKun_> uh.....
[16:30:29] <taplar> no clue there
[16:31:16] <PettanShoutaKun_> it's probably this $(top.window.frames.myframe.contentDocument).on('keyDown', captureRefresh);
[16:31:48] <taplar> where are you doing that from?
[16:32:13] <taplar> the 'myframe' iframe?
[16:32:35] <PettanShoutaKun_> that's in my index file the myframe is the iframe
[16:32:58] <PettanShoutaKun_> I think I should only have to intercept the keypresses in the parent window perhaps?
[16:33:15] <taplar> that's what i'm thinking
[16:33:30] <taplar> i mean, if the iframe has focus and you refresh it, it's not an issue, right?
[16:34:16] <PettanShoutaKun_> I don't think so but one of the guys testing it said he had to do it there
[16:36:56] <mikesrike> Hello everyone. I want to create a function that would add some of the characters of string in an element into span tag. So for example we are looking for "el" into <div>hello world</div>. Expected effect is: <div>h<span>el</span>o world</div>
[16:38:02] <taplar> are you familiar with String.prototype.replace?
[16:38:21] <Velveeta> mikesrike: you'd probably have to regex that out of the div innerhtml, and reinsert it as a new html string
[16:38:22] <PettanShoutaKun_> I've tried overridding it $(document).on('keyDown', captureRefresh); but it actually does still refresh the page suprisingly....
[16:38:53] <taplar> try a small 'd'
[16:39:21] <taplar> that's what i told my girl
[16:39:42] <Velveeta> lol
[16:40:54] <PettanShoutaKun_> I tried but it still no worky q.q
[16:41:19] <Velveeta> mikesrike: const matches = yourHelloWorldDiv.text().match(/(.*)(el)(.*)/); yourHelloWorldDiv.html(`${matches[1]}<span>${matches[2]}</span>${matches[3]}`);
[16:41:21] <Velveeta> something like that
[16:43:15] <mikesrike> return html.replace(/(cow)/g, '<span class="smallcaps">$1</span>'); <---- How can I use some variable instead of word cow in the replace?
[16:44:19] <robertmaxrees> gotta context for us?
[16:45:02] <robertmaxrees> also: does the environment you're using support es6?
[16:45:03] <PettanShoutaKun_> now I'm stuck wondering if A || B && C is the same as AA || (B && C)
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> peter technically they aren't;
[16:47:12] <robertmaxrees> oh, wait...
[16:47:14] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm..
[16:47:24] <taplar> my gut says no, but i'd have to test it
[16:47:26] <robertmaxrees> operator precedence says they should be.
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/X28TWUE.png
[16:48:07] <robertmaxrees> && takes precedence over ||, so that would get evaluated first.
[16:48:23] <taplar> ah
[16:48:44] <PettanShoutaKun_> I'm pretty sure that it's not working :/
[16:48:53] <robertmaxrees> is it unemployed?
[16:48:55] <taplar> wait, but doesn't that mean that A || B would evaluate first?
[16:49:04] <PettanShoutaKun_> $(document).on('keydown', captureRefresh);
[16:49:07] <taplar> because the left of && would evaluate first
[16:49:24] <PettanShoutaKun_> doesn't seem to be canceling or intercepting refresh at all
[16:49:25] <PettanShoutaKun_> :(
[16:49:38] <robertmaxrees> taplar it's in reverse.
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> higher score == first.
[16:50:15] <taplar> k, and since there are no () the left is simply B
[16:50:54] <robertmaxrees> PettanShoutaKun_ so ytou're working with iframes, yeah?  anybody ask the obvious CORS question?
[16:51:00] <Velveeta> also, if you just use a string.replace, does that insert the literal <> tags as &lt; and &gt; or does it insert them as actual element tags?
[16:51:30] <PettanShoutaKun_> it's all on the same site
[16:51:42] <robertmaxrees> same port, protocol, and domain?
[16:51:45] <PettanShoutaKun_> I'm losing my mind though... I can't get refresh to cancel at ALL
[16:53:13] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/d0745tL8/
[16:54:00] <PettanShoutaKun_> okay... I did get it to work BUT he's right
[16:54:12] <PettanShoutaKun_> if you click in the iframe and then hit F5 or CTRL + R
[16:54:19] <PettanShoutaKun_> then it refreshes anyway
[16:54:29] <PettanShoutaKun_> it's like the iframe body also needs to intercept the keys
[16:54:37] <taplar> but that's not a problem, right?
[16:54:59] <taplar> i thought the issue you said was refreshing the top page and the iframes not showing up again
[16:55:07] <PettanShoutaKun_> it is because hitting refresh inside the iframe still refreshes the whole entire page
[16:55:10] <PettanShoutaKun_> iframe included
[16:55:17] <taplar> ah
[16:55:47] <PettanShoutaKun_> HNNNNNG....
[16:56:02] <PettanShoutaKun_> that's so dumb
[16:58:31] <PettanShoutaKun_> I DEED IT
[17:00:54] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[17:01:00] <robertmaxrees> what was the solution?
[17:01:03] <PettanShoutaKun_> you can still refresh if you click off the browser though
[17:01:22] <PettanShoutaKun_> this is so retarded.... not javascript or even the browser...
[17:01:36] <PettanShoutaKun_> the underlying problem and that this happens at all is just absolutely retarded....
[17:02:13] <PettanShoutaKun_> I actually do have to bind to keydown on thhe main page and on the iframe itself too
[17:02:44] <PettanShoutaKun_> I think it's better to store the frames url instead of unload.... and maybe check if it was stored and navigate back to it on reload?
[17:03:10] <taplar> you said you were using angular to build your page?
[17:04:36] <PettanShoutaKun_> it has angularJS in it somewhere
[17:04:44] <PettanShoutaKun_> I don't know much about the legacy pages
[17:04:55] <PettanShoutaKun_> I know a lot more about the newer angular pages
[17:11:14] <PettanShoutaKun_> maybe I should be capturing this in the parent window....
[17:11:24] <PettanShoutaKun_> instead of trying to write down my url onbeforeunload in my iframe
[17:12:33] <matte0> taplar and robertmaxtrees: Many thanks for your help. My page is now working by using moment.js and iterating over the array with $.each. Many thanks!!
[17:18:07] <robertmaxrees> matte0 btw you don't need $.each() for that ;)
[17:21:21] <PettanShoutaKun_> what event do I want to capture if I want it to fire every time the user clicks a link or refreshes or does anything that would leave the current page as of jquery > 1.8
[17:22:09] <taplar> afaik it would be that onbeforeunload or onunload
[17:22:10] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery question heh
[17:23:37] <taplar> i'd really be more interested in investigating why it's not rebuilding correctly though, instead of intercepting the users choice to refresh or leave the page
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:25:57] <PettanShoutaKun_> what do you mean rebuilding correctly?
[17:26:06] <PettanShoutaKun_> also is that on('unload')?
[17:26:23] <PettanShoutaKun_> do I capture that from $(document) or $(window) or something else?
[17:26:32] <taplar> you said hitting f5 causes the iframes to not appear again as they were
[17:26:34] <taplar> right?
[17:27:54] <robertmaxrees> matte0 just repond in the channel instead of trying to notify/pm me ;)
[17:28:21] <matte0> robertmaxrees sorry, sir!
[17:29:39] <PettanShoutaKun_> yeah
[17:30:11] <PettanShoutaKun_> probably because the iframe source is set dynamically at runtime
[17:30:21] <PettanShoutaKun_> and not actually defined on the index page anywhere
[17:30:33] <taplar> so figure out a way to restore that conditionally on page load
[17:31:46] <PettanShoutaKun_> that's what I'm trying
[17:31:53] <PettanShoutaKun_> I figured out why unload doesn't work
[17:32:01] <PettanShoutaKun_> because angularJS doesn't actually refresh a page AT ALL
[17:32:16] <PettanShoutaKun_> technically the user is always on this same page....
[17:32:48] <PettanShoutaKun_> when I hard refresh the browser I hit the unload event
[17:32:56] <taplar> uh, hitting F5 will reload the page, regardless of angular
[17:33:26] <taplar> the important part is if any modal data that angular uses to build the view is restored or not
[17:33:41] <PettanShoutaKun_> yeah
[17:33:48] <PettanShoutaKun_> wait....
[17:33:49] <PettanShoutaKun_> WAIT>
[17:34:06] <PettanShoutaKun_> OOOOOOOOOOH you're right
[17:34:09] <taplar> lol
[17:34:27] <PettanShoutaKun_> I'm thinking like what if I navigate away from the page (click a link etc).... it wont work....
[17:34:35] <PettanShoutaKun_> but that's retarded because that's not the issue
[17:34:40] <PettanShoutaKun_> thank you!
[17:35:12] <taplar> r/modal/model
[17:36:03] <PettanShoutaKun_> so I want to save the current page to local storage
[17:36:09] <PettanShoutaKun_> and just restore it after refresh
[17:36:40] <taplar> it's an option, sure
[18:15:13] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[18:28:30] <PettanShoutaKun_> window.location.href = '/some/relative/path'; actually didn't work.... when my page was loading
[18:28:34] <PettanShoutaKun_> what da heel
[18:39:03] <PettanShoutaKun_> is window.location.assign(); more powerful?
[18:39:19] <taplar> you might ask around ##javascript
