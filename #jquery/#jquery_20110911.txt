[00:00:56] <JesperA> obviously not
[00:01:02] <JesperA> how would that work?
[00:01:29] <JesperA> What if someone failed to write in required fields on 2 tabs, how would that be showned?
[00:01:37] <NielsNL> give me a moment, im prepare an example
[00:02:12] <NielsNL> that is what i hoped to get an answer here :D
[00:03:32] <JesperA> one solution open all tabs if someone fail to enter a required field
[00:04:05] <JesperA> ugly but it works
[00:09:48] <NielsNL> http://jsfiddle.net/P3B6a/
[00:09:57] <NielsNL> How can you do that?
[00:29:36] <emergion> I have a paragraph which is "draggable" and after I drop the paragraph inside a div, which is "droppable", the text from the paragraph just sits there. Any easy way to get tid of it?
[00:29:49] <emergion> *rid
[00:33:29] <airtonix> use .remove() on it
[00:33:51] <airtonix> read the draggable documentation for event callabled you can provide
[00:35:04] <emergion> airtonix, when I use remove on the event, or the paragraph which was dropped, the text stays there but it no longer draggable?
[00:35:20] <airtonix> emergion: you're not using it on the right object then
[00:36:01] <airtonix> and it might not be obvious that you're using the wrong event
[00:50:01] <emergion> airtonix, Hmm how do I find the correct event? Is it the event I need to destroy ?
[01:05:25] <NielsNL> JesperA: are you still here?
[01:05:34] <NielsNL> i found a solution on the net: http://jsfiddle.net/P3B6a/1/
[01:05:37] <shkiper> hey, guys. I have a question. I need to create a component that show a grid (divs) and also div that will be draggable element. One row. Anybody saw the example of it or something like that?
[01:09:04] <airtonix> emergion: no, http://jsfiddle.net/4M2Na/
[01:21:57] <becom33> how can I use Jquery to swap web page another page ?
[01:24:22] <aavikkojootti> what do you mean by swap?
[01:25:56] <donCams> becom33: $('*').html(''); $('*').load('other.html');
[01:26:16] <MoTiOnXml> donCams: nice :)
[01:27:31] <donCams> hehe :P
[01:30:43] <gf3> well
[01:30:56] <gf3> you can just do it from the top most element
[01:31:02] <gf3> you don't need to replace them
[01:31:04] <gf3> ALL
[01:32:42] <donCams> $('body').html; $('body').load('other.html body');
[01:35:13] <becom33> donCams what do u call that ?
[01:37:11] <Whirl3d> How do I select the entire contents of a given text input element on focus?
[01:38:22] <Whirl3d> Or how do I place the cursor at the end of the contents of a text input element on focus?
[01:39:40] <jeremyBass2> hello, anyone got a sec and know off the top why one would repeatedly get "Unable to get value of the property 'guid'" when using the ui tabs.  html validates, no visiable script errors, everything seems very inorder.
[01:41:48] <gf3> Whirl3d: .focus() should put the cursor at the end
[01:41:54] <gf3> .select() will… you know
[01:43:18] <Whirl3d> gf3, I didn't see the trigger part of .select...thanks.
[01:50:25] <jeremyBass2> gosh it's probably to later for anyone that will know..
[01:50:43] <shkiper> gyus, why my div don't drag although coordinates change http://jsfiddle.net/shkiper/9Cusr/3/embedded/result/
[01:55:17] <Onions> How do I check whether a div exists?
[01:55:22] <Onions> (with a specific ID)
[01:56:43] <Whirl3d> $("#"+idvar).length>0
[01:57:55] <Onions> is it .length or .length()?
[01:58:37] <gf3> document.getElementById( idvar )
[01:58:47] <gf3> a bit faster
[01:59:14] <Whirl3d> not very jquery either
[02:01:26] <gf3> jquery is just javascript
[02:02:10] <Whirl3d> gf3, how dare you. Jquery is so much more than just javascript. Ask coldhead...there's magic, and a couple of other things that make it more..
[02:02:23] <Whirl3d> coldhead has the entire list.
[02:02:25] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:02:46] <gf3> Whirl3d: it's coldhead's first day!
[02:03:20] <Whirl3d> and if you listen to him, it often sounds like it's gonna be his last day..
[02:14:09] <troubleman> Hey, that side scroller thing at http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/items.aspx - how do I do that?
[02:14:49] <gf3> scroll event
[02:15:09] <troubleman> no need for external plugin?
[02:19:46] <Onions> what should https://gist.github.com/1209377 be? :o
[02:19:57] <Onions> getting "update undefined" in web console
[03:03:35] <Soothsayer> if I'm using creating a widget which will be hotlinked by thousand's of websites.. and my widget requires some jQuery to be used, does it make more sense for me to just include the jquery code in my js file or should I load it via google cdn?
[03:04:34] <JesperA> google cdn ofcourse
[03:04:52] <ravenzz> or plain js
[03:12:07] <Whirl3d> Why is it that two divs, floated left suddenly mess up if one is holding a form? And can I fix it using jquery?
[03:12:23] <JesperA> hahahaha
[03:12:26] <JesperA> lol
[03:13:28] <Whirl3d> Okay, it's not just a form. I guess I need to go to #css (where no one ever shows up, lol)
[03:13:32] <JesperA> 1) A div doesnt get messed upp just because it is holding a form, something else in your markup code is wrong. 2) jQuery would be a grosely overkill for fixing that
[03:23:22] <justmozzy> hi guys. I am trying to copy jquery events from one object to the other. I found two ways of doing that using .data("events") and .data()[$.expando]["events"] but both return me "undefined". anyone has an idea?
[03:24:01] <justmozzy> I'm using jquery 1.4.3
[03:36:34] <Whirl3d> how does one detatch an element without losing reference to it?
[03:37:25] <Whirl3d> aha, detach, no second t...lol nvm
[03:41:01] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[03:41:34] <Double_Rainbow> on this website: http://www.lematinal.com/, i am trying to do $("#akashsecret").show(); in Chrome console
[03:41:43] <Double_Rainbow> but all i am getting is Type Error
[03:41:46] <Double_Rainbow> what is it?
[03:44:48] <Double_Rainbow> anyone?
[03:46:23] <Double_Rainbow> what i am getting Type error
[03:46:33] <Double_Rainbow> on a simple css: display: block
[03:48:55] <Whirl3d> akashsecret doesn't exist
[03:48:59] <Woet> aargh
[03:49:10] <Woet> i'm still looking for that site with amazing css3/jquery effects :(
[03:51:03] <Double_Rainbow> Whirl3d: of course it exists
[03:51:10] <Double_Rainbow> its in view source
[03:51:24] <Whirl3d> perhaps you are having conflicts with two versions of jquery running?
[03:51:38] <Whirl3d> I can't get $("anything") to work
[03:51:48] <Double_Rainbow> hmmm
[03:53:30] <Double_Rainbow> yeah, apparently, document.getElementById('akashsecret').style.display='block'; works
[03:53:38] <skamikaze> noConflict @ Whirl3d
[03:53:41] <skamikaze> $.noConflict @ Whirl3d
[03:53:57] <skamikaze> Whirl3d: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:54:19] <skamikaze> you try to use prototypejs and jquery
[03:57:57] <Whirl3d> skamikaze, not me my friend. Double_Rainbow
[03:58:26] <Double_Rainbow> wut?
[04:00:27] <juha_> coldhead: http://imgur.com/gallery/9kAJL
[04:01:18] <Double_Rainbow> coldhead: you need to help me crack this easter egg dude
[04:01:41] <Double_Rainbow> there is an easter egg on http://www.lematinal.com/ in div akashsecret
[04:02:15] <Double_Rainbow> i can make it appear document.getElementById('akashsecret').style.display='block'; but i do not know what triggers it
[04:02:23] <Woet> anyone knows a flip animation that works for images and flips vertically?
[04:11:58] <WebHosting> Hi every one , how i can get this with jquery : by clicking on the upload file i will have the path printed into areatext or zone text Thanks
[04:13:01] <Flayks> hi there
[04:13:28] <Double_Rainbow> WebHosting: in php, when you upload a file, the path of the file is an array, you can echo it from there
[04:15:30] <Flayks> do you have an idea why this code doesn't give the same value in firefox like chrome ? http://pastie.org/2517748
[04:16:09] <WebHosting> Double_Rainbow without PHP just with JQUERY
[04:16:14] <WebHosting> i can not?
[04:16:44] <WebHosting> as for example clicking on the bouton and get the value into DIV or text zone

I want those new sites to be availabe from a tree-menu on the samen page, witch will link to the new "invisible" tabset pages inside the tabset-system. But as mentioned, the new pages will NOT
[04:49:15] <pimperle> hi
[04:49:39] <pimperle> is there a way to select a tab to be activated via the url?
[04:51:04] <pimperle> i'm trying to build a simple website and thought of using tabs for the main navigation. however i cannot figure out how to open the site with a specific tab, which means i cannot have bookmarks.
[04:51:22] <donCams> pimperle: you can set a hash in the URL
[04:51:35] <pimperle> and i'm totally unsure what the alternatives are, so i'd be grateful for some kind of documentation for starters.
[04:51:56] <pimperle> donCams: i tried that, but at least it did not work automatically
[04:52:07] <pimperle> will i have to manually parse the url and activate the given tab?
[04:55:08] <donCams> yep
[05:06:06] <aditsu> hi, I'm having a problem with jquery: see http://pastebin.me/954ea079d7c468ade1a7911b6f0346de ; in Firefox it shows the image then an alert with the correct width (275) but in Chromium it shows an alert with 0 and then shows the image
[05:07:28] <aditsu> how can I make it work the same way in Chromium?
[05:10:41] <ravenzz> aditsu http://jsfiddle.net/E9Sv3/
[05:12:01] <aditsu> ravenzz: hm, that works; I found some pages that say I have to load all css first
[05:12:08] <aditsu> testing that...
[05:14:29] <aditsu> doesn't seem to work
[05:19:14] <aditsu> ravenzz: ok how about this: http://aditsu.no-ip.info:8082/ - it has no extra stuff
[05:19:31] <aditsu> still doesn't work correctly in Chromium
[05:19:48] <ravenzz> alert($(&quot;#img&quot;).width()); ?
[05:20:22] <aditsu> huh? escape the quotes? well, I can do that too...
[05:21:03] <aditsu> but I've NEVER seen it done in javascript
[05:21:45] <ravenzz> :?
[05:21:57] <ravenzz> actually that's what you have
[05:22:13] <aditsu> ravenzz: I changed it now; obviously it's a syntax error
[05:22:20] <aditsu> ravenzz: I'll change it back
[05:22:26] <skamikaze> aitsu: document.ready differs on browsers, if you don't set the width by attributes/css, you get a zero width
[05:22:50] <aditsu> ravenzz: back to normal quotes now
[05:22:56] <skamikaze> aditsu: if you want to run your scripts after images are loaded use window.load
[05:23:31] <aditsu> skamikaze: oh really? I'll give it a try
[05:24:06] <skamikaze> aditsu: sry typo
[05:24:32] <skamikaze> window.onload = function () { console.log( $('#img').width() ); };
[05:24:45] <aditsu> skamikaze: I did $(window).load(...)
[05:24:51] <aditsu> seems to work now
[05:25:09] <skamikaze> erm far from what i wanted to tell you ;)
[05:25:24] <mikeuding> hi everyone
[05:25:28] <aditsu> skamikaze: how is it different?
[05:26:03] <skamikaze> now you create a jquery object of window and use $.load
[05:26:07] <skamikaze> use window.onload
[05:26:24] <skamikaze> it fires when any resource was loaded
[05:26:36] <aditsu> skamikaze: but it does the same thing, doesn't it?
[05:26:50] <aditsu> I mean $(window).load sets window.onload
[05:28:32] <aditsu> anyway, I'll check window.onload too
[05:28:38] <skamikaze> na it's ok
[05:29:33] <skamikaze> never used $(window).load as there's window.onload but hell ya don't care bout the mini bloat ;)
[05:29:33] <aditsu> also works
[05:30:13] <aditsu> I might as well go with jquery all the way :)
[05:30:30] <aditsu> since I already use it
[05:32:03] <aditsu> skamikaze: thanks for the help
[05:48:39] <jqueryUser> hi i am using .accordion() and am willing to change height of active accordion is it possible? i can't find any arguements except autoHeight to function so do i need to use CSS height: 240px or smthng?
[06:05:19] <anli__> When I try to hide a div and show another div at the same time, both operations using slide, the result is not what I expect: http://pastebin.com/sBL3u7nT
[06:05:31] <anli__>  The div to be hidden slides, but not the one that is shown
[06:05:39] <anli__> It just pops up
[06:06:19] <jqueryUser> CSS height:100px doesn't work for my issue .. can anybody tell me how to set accordion content heights to fixed value without using autoHeight?
[06:12:23] <imsky> trilla
[06:13:12] <jqueryUser> anli__: i am new to jquery but i think if you use callback it might work?
[06:13:44] <anli__> Aha, not having two effects at the same time?
[06:14:45] <jqueryUser> oh i thought you wanted effect 2 after effect 1 has finished
[06:16:57] <anli__> dunno what I want yet :)
[06:17:16] <anli__> Maybe I should be fine with the already obtained visual behaviour
[06:20:58] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Does anyone here use lesscss?
[06:21:31] <_|Nix|_> I'm trying to assign a variable based on a javascript expression, like so: @var: ~`<expression>` ...
[06:22:14] <_|Nix|_> It works correctly, but when I subsequently try to use @var as part of some other expression, like @var1: @var + @var2;, it gives me NaN for @var1 ...
[06:23:26] <_|Nix|_> So, is there an example of how to correctly place a variable defined as ~`...` on the right-hand-side of a later assignment that is an arithmetic expression?
[06:49:13] <webguynow> Had a ? about why my browser is not caching jQuery served from Google api cdn ?  seems to need to pull this down every time I view the page.  waiting ....
[06:50:35] <pheredhel`> webguynow: what does the header send by google tell about caching jquery?
[06:51:51] <webguynow> not sure, I assumed this was cached automatically
[06:52:08] <webguynow> I reviewed some browser settings  but couldn't find anything specific on it
[06:52:50] <pheredhel`> well, actually the website you are loading something from, does tell your browser if it can be cached and for how long
[06:52:58] <pheredhel`> do you have a url for the jquery?
[06:57:06] <webguynow> using
[06:57:07] <webguynow> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6/jquery.min.js
[06:57:56] <webguynow> but my pages using that are not Live (online) yet
[06:58:20] <webguynow> except for maybe 1 or 2
[06:58:36] <webguynow> how do I specify the cache parameters ?
[06:59:09] <pheredhel`> well the server specifies them, will check
[06:59:44] <jqueryUser> use header() in case of php?
[06:59:55] <pheredhel`> for your own page, yes
[07:00:06] <pheredhel`> for jquery, not sure
[07:00:16] <pheredhel`> eh wrong, for jquery you can'T
[07:00:32] <jqueryUser> for that googleapis.com you can't
[07:00:41] <pheredhel`> correct
[07:00:59] <webguynow> weird,  I thought that was supposed to be the advantage
[07:03:34] <pheredhel`> google is funny: Expires: Sat, 03 Sep 2011 15:10:17 GMT
[07:03:51] <pheredhel`> from the http header when fetching jquery from the url you postet
[07:04:24] <pheredhel`> i.e. they have an expiery date in the past... this prevents most caching
[07:18:48] <pheredhel`> hmm, ok, i get an error from jquery through an animation (only in ie7) , it seems that at one point e.cur() returns 0 (which leads to a division by 0)
[07:19:31] <pheredhel`> but i can't really create a simple testcase yet

[09:15:03] <woopwoop> anyone know how to print out the content of an object?
[09:15:08] <woopwoop> String(Obj) doesn't work
[09:16:28] <Flayks> can you say me why this line give me a different value between firefox and other browsers? http://pastie.org/2518812
[09:20:31] <Kamakazi> woopwoop: Don't you have to reference which piece of the object you want, so something like Obj["info"]
[09:23:14] <woopwoop> i have a list of imgs for this slideshow in a div, only one of them would have display block
[09:23:21] <woopwoop> so i used 		var a = $('.featuredArt').find('img').css('display', 'block');
[09:23:42] <woopwoop> but when I try to use a or print out a I just get htmlelement or object or something
[09:23:56] <woopwoop> i'm not sure whats all in the object or where to start to print out parts of it
[09:24:13] <woopwoop> i pretty much need to get the id of the element it finds
[09:25:05] <woopwoop> in php i can just print out everything in an array with print_r
[09:25:14] <woopwoop> is there something like that for jquery objects?
[09:27:54] <imanc> woopwoop: console.debug() ?
[09:30:05] <woopwoop> doesn't do anything for me
[09:30:22] <woopwoop> 		var a = $('.featuredAr').find('img').css('display', 'block');
[09:30:22] <woopwoop> 		console.debug(a);
[09:30:40] <imanc> sorry .. console.log()  mixing python with jquery
[09:31:04] <imanc> then open yer firebug console or chrome console
[09:34:10] <woopwoop> didn't do shit in ff console but does in chrome
[09:34:14] <woopwoop> damn ff

[09:54:44] <nail_> jimi_hendrix: oh actually removeClass() with no argument will do it aswell
[09:54:56] <jimi_hendrix> nail_, ok
[09:55:21] <booboonathan> Guys does anyone know of a plugin that changes the image when you hover over different sections of an image?
[09:55:29] <booboonathan> it used to be in the iWeb package from apple a while back
[09:57:38] * jedimind blinks
[09:58:20] <booboonathan> haha
[09:58:44] <booboonathan> So there's a Big Image, and then when you hover over different sections of that large image the image changes
[10:01:12] <jedimind> no i get it
[10:01:23] <jedimind> just dont think there is, nor is there a need, for a "plugin" for that
[10:01:31] <jedimind> when you can write it yourself with probably 3 lines of jquery
[10:02:42] <booboonathan> haha, 3 lines?
[10:02:46] <booboonathan> I challenge that! :p
[10:03:04] <booboonathan> intact i'd give you $10 to do it
[10:03:09] <jedimind> lol
[10:03:11] <booboonathan> if you did it right
[10:03:18] <gtklocker> booboonathan: give it to me :P
[10:03:21] <jedimind>  i have better things to do on a sunday
[10:03:31] <booboonathan> sunday == day of rest
[10:03:38] <jimi_hendrix> == watch football day
[10:03:45] <booboonathan> haha, gtklocker if you can do it then yeah sure
[10:03:50] <jimi_hendrix> and do all the homework i am procrastinating
[10:04:02] <booboonathan> fair enough
[10:05:40] <eveningsky> can't figure out how to block css hover state. I tried return false on mouseover, mouseenter, mousemove; none of them will block the effect.
[10:09:40] <booboonathan> Anyone up for the challenge, doesn't need to be in 3 lines!
[10:09:48] <booboonathan> i just need it working :P
[10:20:18] <aditsu> booboonathan: how should it change?
[10:24:15] <aherlambang> can someone help me out with jQuery validation
[10:24:20] <aherlambang> the code is http://jsfiddle.net/WZKuA/
[10:24:36] <aherlambang> I wrote a custom validation so that the two phone numbers aren't the same
[10:24:39] <aherlambang> but it didn't work
[10:24:52] <aherlambang> pretty sure everything is correct, I may just miss something
[10:26:39] <aherlambang> also I need the message to appear below the three text input box, how do I do this?
[10:28:37] <aherlambang> anyone?
[10:35:53] <blup> i'm having trouble with $.getJSON... i keep getting "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://vimeo.c... Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." even though i read JSONP is allowed by the origin policy
[10:37:41] <brixsat> hey any timemce expert?
[10:38:06] <brixsat> *any tinymce expert? i cant put the background100% transparent
[10:38:37] <blup> nevermind, apparently had to add ?callback=? at the end of my request
[10:53:41] <aherlambang> does anyone know how I can change the position of the error message when there is an error
[11:00:32] <woopwoop> what's the correct syntax for this? setTimeout($.nxImg(e, d),3000);
[11:00:56] <woopwoop> or something like it
[11:04:05] <iszak> woopwoop, not without breaking IE
[11:04:14] <woopwoop> haha
[11:04:17] <woopwoop> damn.
[11:04:33] <iszak> woopwoop, it should be setTimeout($.nxImg, 3000, [e,d])
[11:04:34] <sunscreen> /me smashes svg with a hammer

[11:05:09] <woopwoop> thanks
[11:05:19] <iszak> woopwoop, but the thing with that is IE doesn't support the 3rd parameter as the args.
[11:05:52] <woopwoop> i see
[11:06:06] <woopwoop> i'll fix around it, have the setTimeout on a vanilla function without any args

[11:07:21] <sunscreen> any one here ever frgged with svg / foreignObject ?
[11:07:45] <iszak> what are you trying to do sunscreen ?
[11:08:56] <sunscreen> well i found this kinda cool svg example.. then i saw a semi dynamic version that could load a iframe .. so i am trying to make this fully dynamic version do the same
[11:09:04] <sunscreen> http://stream.selectukradio.tk/shoutstats-0.8.4/svgtest.html
[11:12:30] <sunscreen> I am sure there is something weird going on with foreignObject created createElementNS
[11:14:31] <sunscreen> chrome inspector shows it as lower case foreignobject which is a bug in the inspector
[11:14:50] <sunscreen> its supposed to be foreignObject
[11:17:34] <sunscreen> me and phrogz from #svg worked through it the other day and here it is work in static mode:
[11:17:36] <sunscreen>  http://phrogz.net/svg/sunscreamer.svg
[11:32:51] <pl0sh> hey there, when someone clicks on an <a> element I want to attach it a class, so I am doing this: $('a').click(function() { $(this).addClass('active'); });
[11:32:59] <pl0sh> but it's not working, am I doing anything wrong?
[11:33:32] <paul_irish> nope
[11:33:35] <paul_irish> is it in a document ready block?
[11:33:56] <pl0sh> nope
[11:34:15] <asdfqwer> hi
[11:34:27] <asdfqwer> how can one concat selectors with this keyword?
[11:34:43] <paul_irish> better idea. pl0sh
[11:34:50] <paul_irish> $('a').live('click', function.......
[11:34:53] <asdfqwer> i.e. $(this+" > element")
[11:34:58] <mytoz> hmm
[11:35:01] <paul_irish> $(this).find(' > element')
[11:35:05] <asdfqwer> hmm
[11:35:18] <mytoz> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2984345
[11:35:22] <asdfqwer> why won't jquery consume the string?
[11:35:32] <asdfqwer> could i try this.toString()
[11:35:34] <mytoz> sean`: wrote some docs for dquery :)
[11:35:36] <asdfqwer> or some native js function
[11:35:47] <pl0sh> paul_irish: i tried with .live() too but I didn't try the find()
[11:35:47] <paul_irish> asdfqwer: i just told you what to do bro
[11:35:48] <pl0sh> let me see.
[11:35:54] <asdfqwer> just curious, not saying that, .find() is not the solution
[11:35:56] <asdfqwer> i konw
[11:35:58] <paul_irish> pl0sh: the find() was for asdfqwer
[11:36:00] <asdfqwer> >doing
[11:36:16] <asdfqwer> >mah pride
[11:36:18] <pl0sh> paul_irish: oh haha ok
[11:36:23] <asdfqwer> >belongs to ireland
[11:36:27] <paul_irish> o.o
[11:36:46] <paul_irish> so you realllllly want to make that work?
[11:36:49] <Pathos> is that a surname
[11:36:53] <Pathos> or are you irish?
[11:36:57] <paul_irish> surname
[11:36:59] <Pathos> oh wicked.
[11:37:06] <asdfqwer> irish
[11:37:10] <Pathos> But you're not really irish?
[11:37:13] <mytoz> "scottish" is his last name I think
[11:37:13] <asdfqwer> lol
[11:37:15] <asdfqwer> same question
[11:37:16] <Pathos> not that it matters, just curious
[11:37:18] <paul_irish> lets see.. you could set the toString() to somehow set a unique id on the element unless there is already one there.. and then output # + uniqueid
[11:37:33] <asdfqwer> i mean, this is a js object
[11:37:36] <paul_irish> Pathos: i'm 1/16th irish. counts, right?
[11:37:41] <asdfqwer> i just have no clude what jquery is doing to it
[11:37:44] <asdfqwer> nm
[11:37:46] <asdfqwer> >work
[11:37:57] <paul_irish> asdfqwer: `this` is a DOM element, most likely.
[11:38:01] <pl0sh> paul_irish: so I tired the $('a').live('click',function() { $(this).addClass('active'); });
[11:38:05] <pl0sh> but it's still not working..
[11:38:05] <paul_irish> not that overriding toString on a domelement is a good idea
[11:38:10] <pl0sh> s/tired/tried
[11:38:16] <paul_irish> pl0sh: well you must be doin it wrung
[11:38:36] <pl0sh> yeah, that's what I though
[11:38:39] <paul_irish> t
[11:38:52] <mytoz> pl0sh: perhaps some event is cancelling bubbling?
[11:39:14] <pl0sh> don't think so, because everything executes fine
[11:39:22] <mytoz> are you by any chance using "return false;"?
[11:39:23] <DrCode> hi all
[11:39:25] <mytoz> in some event
[11:39:25] <DrCode> whats up
[11:39:32] <DrCode> I need little help
[11:39:56] <paul_irish> you're in the right place, doctor
[11:40:09] <DrCode> I have 1 windows with flash , I want to put some nice chat , I use in jquery
[11:40:37] <DrCode> is there way to put with nice style flash with chat window?
[11:41:43] <pl0sh> paul_irish: now it's working lol
[11:42:13] <ravenzz> your english is worse than mine, I am surprised lol
[11:42:14] <paul_irish> woo
[11:42:15] <mytoz> paul_irish: https://github.com/torholm/dquery
[11:42:24] <asdfqwer> nasty slideshow hack http://malcon.allisonhunt.com/
[11:42:27] <mytoz> paul_irish: a bit weird name
[11:42:41] <paul_irish> datequery was taken/
[11:42:44] <asdfqwer> plugin was not pulling or displaying description from slideshow
[11:43:00] <paul_irish> $.date ?
[11:43:04] <asdfqwer> i.e. that little blue div with white text in it
[11:43:07] <mytoz> we talked about it yesterday
[11:43:14] <mytoz> don't want to pollute the $ namespace :)
[11:43:29] <mytoz> should probably name it something else
[11:43:33] <asdfqwer> wordpress plugins are suffering
[11:43:44] <ravenzz> asdfqwer I can see the captions
[11:44:13] <asdfqwer> oh god ff does not like it
[11:44:22] <asdfqwer> ravenzz, whta browser?
[11:44:23] <asdfqwer> version?
[11:44:28] <ravenzz> ok let me check
[11:44:31] <ravenzz> asdfqwer chrome
[11:44:34] <ravenzz> the last
[11:45:13] <asdfqwer> gimme second, jumped the gun
[11:47:01] <paul_irish> mytoz: cool api
[11:47:32] <mytoz> paul_irish: it's a pretty good idea, I think, since Date is kind of a mammoth
[11:47:57] <paul_irish> yeah native dates are a pita
[11:47:59] <mytoz> yup
[11:48:04] <asdfqwer> ravenzz, looks good in mine
[11:48:05] <asdfqwer> 13.0.782.220 m
[11:48:14] <mytoz> unfortunately, you can't just function f() {}; f.prototype = Date.prototype;
[11:48:16] <paul_irish> ew stable channel
[11:48:17] <asdfqwer> need check ie7 and 8
[11:48:29] <ravenzz> asdfqwer i can see captions on ff as well
[11:48:57] <asdfqwer> this was like an hour hack
[11:49:03] <mytoz> sucks pretty badly. gotta do an extend() each time we need a new instance of dquery.
[11:50:04] <asdfqwer> anyone do a lot of wp development?
[11:50:53] <ravenzz> asdfqwer you can ask on #wordpress
[11:50:56] <mytoz> paul_irish: any thing that seems to suck?
[11:51:30] <asdfqwer> well a slideshow is not that complicated, but intergrating it into wp-admin probably is
[11:52:09] <paul_irish> mytoz: except the name ? nope
[11:52:12] <paul_irish> :)
[11:52:19] <mytoz> paul_irish: cool
[11:52:26] <mytoz> should really find a better name
[11:53:12] <mytoz> or do $.date, but then that makes it require jquery, also pollutes...
[11:53:37] <Sil4nc4_> hi guys, i want the value of a select box, to use it then to set the current value of the select box to it, for example language switcher
[11:54:31] <NielsNL> hello all, i have a problem with jquery.validation, somehow it is not working on my site (html://www.123kalender.nl/test2.html), but when i clean up the code to put it on http://jsfiddle.net/P3B6a/6/ it works fine.
[11:54:31] <NielsNL> can someone please have a look and give me a suggestion how to find the problem?
[11:55:16] <mytoz> "timeywimeywibblywobbly" perhaps. a bit long, but the reference is nice.
[11:57:08] <paul_irish> mytoz: gooddate.js ?
[11:57:10] <paul_irish> OH I GOT IT
[11:57:11] <paul_irish> hotdate.js
[11:57:42] <paul_irish> mmm
[11:58:00] <ajpiano> paul_irish: don't you think it's a bit sexist to suggest that people go on dates
[11:58:08] <imsky> aw shit it's paul
[11:58:18] <paul_irish> ajpiano: good point
[11:59:01] <mytoz> paul_irish: hah
[11:59:11] <mytoz> saddate
[11:59:32] <mytoz> toString: function() { return ":("; }
[12:03:49] <ravenzz> datenator
[12:04:56] <tonyjcamp> paul_irish I think you spelled 'hot' wrong
[12:05:10] <sixohquad> yeah, its hawt
[12:05:11] <paul_irish> HAWTTTT DATE
[12:05:16] <sixohquad> lol
[12:05:17] <paul_irish> MY BAD
[12:05:20] <mytoz> hawtdate.js then
[12:05:20] <woopwoop> is there a way to pause a setTimeout that's already running?
[12:05:23] <tonyjcamp> Yah, 3 ttt's is correct.
[12:05:28] <paul_irish> woopwoop: nope
[12:05:41] <paul_irish> you can set a flag that you check inside your timeout'd function
[12:06:05] <woopwoop> hm. i'm trying to do a carousel, which it goes to the next picture every 5 seconds, but the user can also manually click to the next img
[12:06:24] <woopwoop> but with that every 5 sec time out running and then go and click next img over n over again it goes nuts
[12:06:54] <bot-t> woopwoop, window.clearTimeout - MDN - Clears the delay set by window.setTimeout() . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.clearTimeout
[12:08:46] <uranther> is there a jquery plugin that gives tiling (like xmonad) to div's?
[12:09:03] <woopwoop> guess clearTimeout could work if an extra param was passed to the function if they manually clicked next
[12:09:04] <woopwoop> thanks
[12:19:03] <mytoz> paul_irish: maybe just jdate
[12:19:09] <paul_irish> lol
[12:19:12] <paul_irish> ?g jdate
[12:19:13] <bot-t> paul_irish, JDate.com - The Leading Jewish Singles Network! Explore the ... - http://www.jdate.com/
[12:19:16] <mytoz> :D
[12:19:21] <mytoz> hawt date!
[12:19:51] <mytoz> obviously, I don't have much imagination
[12:20:16] <kitikonti> why $('#exmple').after('</div>'); dont work?
[12:22:15] <mape> Is there any reason I can't do $.ajax({ 'url': 'http://ma-page.com' , 'success': function(html) { console.log($(html).find('link').length;); } }); ?
[12:22:27] <ajpiano> mape: cross domain ajax?
[12:22:37] <ajpiano> oh AND
[12:22:38] <mape> ajpiano: nope
[12:23:04] <mape> and the ; should be there..
[12:23:21] <ajpiano> mape: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784
[12:23:25] <mape> $.ajax({ 'url': '/' , 'success': function(html) { console.log($(html).find('link').length); } }); returns 0
[12:23:42] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc
[12:23:56] <ajpiano> lol mape i had to do the same thing recently, def had to use ben's plugin for it
[12:24:23] <booboonathan> its impossible to fetch cross-domains via ajax, amirite?
[12:24:49] <mape> ajpiano: ah nice, thanks
[12:24:50] <ajpiano> booboonathan: using regular ol' fashioned ajax yes
[12:25:03] <booboonathan> but?
[12:25:24] <booboonathan> i know you can use iframes, but apart from that?
[12:25:30] <ajpiano> there are a variety of workarounds
[12:25:36] <booboonathan> and you could use fget() in php
[12:25:47] <booboonathan> but in javascript its impossible?
[12:25:56] <mape> ajpiano: works like a charm :)
[12:27:54] <ajpiano> woot
[12:28:06] <NielsNL> is for asking again, but does see someone a reason why the validation is not working on html://www.123kalender.nl/test2.html
[12:28:44] <NielsNL> I have been searching the whole day but cant find it :(
[12:33:09] <aherlambang_> can anyone tell me how I can append to an array that is declared like this http://pastie.org/2519610
[12:33:12] <aherlambang_> would append work?
[12:33:32] <ajpiano> that's .... not an array
[12:33:34] <ajpiano> or a string
[12:35:41] <aherlambang_> so how do I append to it
[12:35:44] <haizum> is it true that i can just shorthand my jquery with $(function() { instead of $(document).ready(function() { ?
[12:36:14] <aherlambang_> is that a dicstionary in javascript?
[12:36:42] <ajpiano> aherlambang_: var foo = {bar: "baz"}; foo.bam = "boop";  var something = "wat";  foo[something] = "zoop";
[12:36:46] <ajpiano> yes
[12:36:52] <ajpiano> haizum: yes,
[12:37:37] <aherlambang_> so just do foo[something] = value
[12:38:03] <ajpiano> no, that's for adding a dynamically named key
[12:38:24] <ajpiano> go read about how objects work in javascript
[12:38:56] <aherlambang_> so I can't do dataString['address2'] = address2;
[12:39:06] <ajpiano> yes, you can do that
[12:39:13] <ajpiano> but you can also do dataString.address2
[12:39:17] <ajpiano>  = address 2;
[12:39:28] <ajpiano> having an object named "dataString" is, as we say, asinine
[12:40:49] <muzone> http://vimeo.com/20250134
[12:41:14] <muzone> damn thats pretty
[12:43:18] <muzone> 40000 versions of the same logo holy shit
[12:43:42] <marienz> muzone: could you please avoid amsg? it's making our anti-spambot grumpy.
[12:44:46] <aherlambang_> I have a question about validation in jQuery
[12:44:56] <aherlambang_> I wanted to validate whether two phone number are equal
[12:44:59] <aherlambang_> here's a jsfiddle
[12:45:16] <aherlambang_> I am not sure why the javascript is not working there, I just copied and pasted.. I must be missing something
[12:46:15] <aherlambang_> sorry I am kind of a noob with jsfiddle
[12:46:22] <aherlambang_> can anyone help me out?
[12:46:27] <NielsNL> it helps when you give the url
[12:46:34] <infid> how can i make .css("border", "4px solid blue"); a custom method called .blueBorder() that i can chain to other jquery ?
[12:47:21] <muzone> marienz: i dont give a fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[12:47:27] <muzone> asshole
[12:47:43] <ajpiano> infid: $.fn.blueBorder = function() {  return this.css("border", "4px solid blue"); };
[12:48:08] <aherlambang_> http://jsfiddle.net/tNacL/7/
[12:48:11] <aherlambang_> this one is working
[12:48:22] <marienz> muzone: I'm freenode staff, the bot I'm referring to automatically removes spambots from the network. It is hard for this bot to distinguish you sending the exact same url to several channels at the same time from spam (it arguably *is* spam), and a staffer won't always be around to unset the resulting ban.
[12:48:35] <aherlambang_> here's the URL to the working phone validation that I am trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/tNacL/7/
[12:48:38] <infid> ajpiano: i see, thanks
[12:53:23] <NielsNL> sorry aherlambang_ this is outside my knowledge :(
[12:53:40] <aherlambang_> thanks NielsNL, not a problem
[12:54:04] <NielsNL> i'm also struggling with the validation on my site :(
[12:54:08] <infid> ajpiano: how can i tell if an extension i make is overwriting a built-in jquery function?
[12:54:35] <infid> it'll give an error i guess
[12:55:03] <infid> seems to give a strange error though: Maximum call stack exceeded
[12:55:51] <infid> oh that's because it was recursing
[12:55:57] <ajpiano> yep
[13:05:41] <infid> ajpiano: so it just fails to work rather than giving me an error
[13:05:56] <infid> eg if i do $.fn.find = function () { ... }
[13:06:20] <infid> is there a way to wrap that in a "if function doesn't already exist, then define it"
[13:06:41] <infid> something like if (!$.fn.find) {
[13:09:39] <White--> For jqueryui sortable, in the update event, how can I get the new position of the moved element. I don't need the whole new list (like serialize would give me)
[13:11:54] <White--> got it, ui.item.index()
[13:13:50] <haizum> how would i target all images in a div?
[13:14:03] <haizum> using .each ?
[13:14:15] <ajpiano> $("#somediv img")
[13:15:10] <ajpiano> infid: yes, you can do that
[13:15:20] <haizum> ajpiano thanks
[13:15:22] <ajpiano> infid: but ... there is always going to be a find function
[13:15:25] <haizum> too easy :)
[13:18:16] <haizum> ajpiano that didn't work
[13:18:34] <ajpiano> i don't know what you are trying to do
[13:19:55] <haizum> well i have a div with some buttons in it, and i want to target all the images in the div instead of writing js code for each button's .click events
[13:20:20] <haizum> to slim down my code
[13:30:58] <cccaldas> hi everyone
[13:31:18] <cccaldas> how can i use a blur effect with jquery ?
[13:31:20] <cccaldas> is there a plugin ?
[13:31:27] <haizum> blur? you mean fade?
[13:31:41] <haizum> like lower opacity?
[13:32:24] <cccaldas> haizum: nops, wait a second
[13:32:42] <cccaldas> haizum: something like this, http://www.borisfx.com/images/fx/gaussian_blur.jpg
[13:32:53] <cccaldas> haizum: glaussian blur or motion blur
[13:33:16] <cccaldas> haizum: with flash (actionscript) i can do, but javascript i donw know if is possible
[13:33:22] <cccaldas> *i dont know
[13:40:58] <cccaldas> hello ?
[13:49:18] <bobbobbins> hey, im using $.ajax, to submit a form, but the form has a file in it, and that doesn't transfer, what do i need to do to make that work?

[13:51:40] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge, sweet, thanks
[13:54:16] <DetroitMC> yo
[14:17:09] <haizum> anyone know how to target multiple images in a div for the .click function? i tried $('#div' img).click(function() { and it doesn't seem to work
[14:17:35] <astropirate> haizum:  $('#DIV img').click();
[14:17:43] <astropirate> the 'img' is inside the quote
[14:26:00] <eddiemonge> or $('#div').find('img')
[14:34:32] <abyssal> can anyone see why this isnt working? http://jsfiddle.net/KweMY/1/
[14:36:22] <Accelerator> Is there a jQuery plugin for downloading an image?
[14:36:40] <Accelerator> You click an link, and it prompts the user to download an image.
[14:36:45] <BinaryKitten> abyssal what are you expecting it to do? from where i sit .. it works
[14:36:48] <Accelerator> Without redirecting the page
[14:36:50] <jigz> abyssal: your code works fine http://jsfiddle.net/KweMY/2/
[14:37:01] <dotwired> hi, why can't i combine find and each?
[14:37:38] <BinaryKitten> dotwired depends on how you're doing it.. you should be able to depending on what is returned from the find
[14:38:54] <abyssal> hmm so your seeing data-id get set to 1?
[14:39:32] <BinaryKitten> abyssal it won't get set
[14:39:45] <BinaryKitten> .data maps attributes in but not out
[14:39:57] <BinaryKitten> you need to use .attr('data-id', 1) for that
[14:40:10] <BinaryKitten> it does set id in the data to 1 though
[14:40:17] <Accelerator> Can you use jQuery at all to force a download of a file?
[14:40:34] <Accelerator> Or would I have to do this server side with PHP/headers
[14:40:34] <BinaryKitten> Accelerator you can't use jquery to break web stuff like that..
[14:40:42] <Jon47> lol
[14:40:50] <BinaryKitten> Accelerator yep headers
[14:41:13] <Accelerator> BinaryKitten: Eh..? I'm trying to find the best method for allowing the user to click a link to download an image, without having to redirect the user to another page.
[14:41:15] <BinaryKitten> set the appropriate head to say the content-disposition is attachement
[14:41:31] <Accelerator> BinaryKitten: Will that still allow me to embed images into the page though?
[14:41:39] <BinaryKitten> ??
[14:41:52] <Accelerator> It's an image. Can I still use <img src>?
[14:42:03] <BinaryKitten> if you want hte user to download the image you will have to have a way to serve that up in download format
[14:42:15] <BinaryKitten> so you will need to "redirect" somewhere
[14:42:22] <dotwired> hmm, okay. any idea why this could not work, though? http://pastebin.com/yBft86rA
[14:42:24] <Accelerator> How does Facebook do it then?
[14:42:24] <BinaryKitten> even if it's in a 1 pixel iframe
[14:42:30] <Jon47> Accelerator, are you in control of the server in this case, can you do server side scripting?
[14:42:38] <Accelerator> Yeah, I can
[14:42:47] <Jon47> this isn't really a thing that javascript should be used for
[14:43:01] <Jon47> check out how to do it in the server side language you're using
[14:43:28] <abyssal> BinaryKitten: awesome, thanks so much! that worked..
[14:44:06] <BinaryKitten> abyssal any reason you want to change the attr
[14:44:17] <BinaryKitten> why it's important for it to change i mean@
[14:44:18] <Accelerator> Jon47: Alright, thanks
[14:44:49] <dotwired> so, no idea? ^^
[14:45:23] <BinaryKitten> dotwired give us chance!
[14:45:48] <abyssal> well, the app i am making has a clock in clock out doing ajax calls.. when you clock in it sets the data-id to the timesheet id  on the clock out link
[14:46:08] <abyssal> so that when you clock out it knows what timesheet id your clocking out on..
[14:46:27] <dotwired> BinaryKitten: I did ;) this one isn' working: http://pastebin.com/yBft86rA
[14:46:34] <BinaryKitten> abyssal right.. but why the attribute setting.. .data('id') will give you the id after setting
[14:46:48] <oojacoboo> so, if I am doing soothing like .find("input").eq(2).val().toNumber() and I adjust the value of the input it doesn't update the value represented in the DOM, jquery is pulling the DOM value, not the value overridden in the input.  How can I fix this?
[14:46:59] <BinaryKitten> right dotwired, it's not working ... so what have you done to debug it?
[14:47:02] <dotwired> it should replace some integers in the sortable items after sorting has been done but it doesn't… ^^
[14:47:49] <BinaryKitten> dotwired do you know what ui.item is  or what ui.item.parent() gives you
[14:47:51] <dotwired> i tried to look if it's the wrong elements which i use, if the index is correct..
[14:48:17] <dotwired> yep, ui.item is the dragged item, ui.item.parent() will give me the sortable p
[14:48:23] <dotwired> eh ul
[14:48:53] <BinaryKitten> are you sure on that
[14:48:58] <BinaryKitten> add in a few console.logs
[14:49:01] <BinaryKitten> see what you get
[14:49:11] <dotwired> pretty sure
[14:49:32] <BinaryKitten> if they are both what you're expecting, then move on to the .find('li') to see what you get
[14:49:47] <BinaryKitten> don't just be pretty sure, be certain .. that's why things like console.log exist
[14:50:22] <dotwired> i added alert(index) to see and it output 0-6 when i had 6 elements, and 0-5 when i had 4 elements so i'm sure
[14:51:07] <BinaryKitten> alert is not your friend here
[14:51:27] <BinaryKitten> firebug/chrome dev/dragon fly/F12 tools are your friend
[14:51:37] <BinaryKitten> depending on your browser
[14:51:48] <abyssal> BinaryKitten: to answer your question, I was doing something like this on my clock-in event.. http://jsfiddle.net/xs2fQ/
[14:51:51] <dotwired> it was just testing. i even output the html of the containing li elements and it was correct.
[14:52:06] <abyssal> and then clock out would read the data-id attr..
[14:52:54] <BinaryKitten> ok dotwired so what is the underlying issue then? what, for you, isn't working?
[14:53:09] <dotwired> the replacing.
[14:54:35] <BinaryKitten> dotwired and it's not working at all..
[14:54:41] <BinaryKitten> or not working how you expect
[14:55:04] <BinaryKitten> abyssal ok...
[14:55:32] <abyssal> probably completely wrong way of doing it but still learning = )
[14:55:59] <dotwired> not working at all =(
[14:56:12] <dotwired> i don't get it.
[14:56:14] <BinaryKitten> it's not bad abyssal
[14:56:32] <BinaryKitten> the question though is if you need to set the attribute
[14:56:59] <abyssal> where else would be a good place to store it?
[14:57:02] <BinaryKitten> .data stores it in data but not on the attribute
[14:57:10] <george_> hi all i have a CSS/jQuery question: i have the website www.facesbymelissa.com ........ but when it first enters the site, the navigation item CONTACT is highlighted, when it should be HOME...... anyone can help???????
[14:57:16] <abyssal> oh?
[14:57:29] <snover> no, nobody.
[14:57:34] <BinaryKitten> eg .data('xxx', 'naughty domain name')   and later .data('xxx')  will give you 'naughty domain name'

[14:59:39] <BinaryKitten> george_ have you inspected the link?
[14:59:43] <BinaryKitten> it has "selected"
[14:59:57] <abyssal> so you don't have to associate it with a dom element? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ made me believe that.. possible i read it wrong though
[15:00:05] <BinaryKitten> just need to change that one to the one you want
[15:00:16] <BinaryKitten> abyssal it's associated with a dom element
[15:00:22] <BinaryKitten> but it's not IN the dom element

[15:04:58] <snover> BinaryKitten: the correct answer is ?summon
[15:05:03] <waldmeister> he's back :)
[15:05:20] <abyssal> was starting to think that was some l33t javascript that was above my head = )
[15:05:40] <BinaryKitten> heh
[15:07:58] <abyssal> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/KweMY/8/ <-- not working
[15:08:45] <BinaryKitten> any clue as to which bit isn't working?
[15:10:58] <waldmeister> firebug says: cache[id] is undefined on line 1488 when you try to set the value for timesheet_id
[15:11:49] <abyssal> yeah that's all i am getting also.. so.. $.data('timesheet_id', 1);
[15:11:52] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/KweMY/9/
[15:12:13] <BinaryKitten> i'm not saying switch away from the link
[15:12:28] <BinaryKitten> if you want to use .attr then go for it..
[15:12:32] <waldmeister> I guess it's because you can only set the .data values for elements and not the jquery object itself
[15:12:53] <BinaryKitten> well you can set it on objects as well
[15:13:02] <BinaryKitten> but that gets complicated
[15:13:21] <sphinxxx> anyone know a good plugin for displaying images/div sections in a magazine like format?
[15:13:33] <abyssal> but if you want to call that outside that function would you have to reference it with $('a.test').data('timesheet_id');?
[15:14:16] <BrixSAt> hello
[15:14:22] <abyssal> like my clock-in function will be setting that.. my clockout function will need to be reading it..
[15:14:42] <abyssal> two different links..
[15:14:52] <BinaryKitten> abyssal whatever you set it on
[15:15:04] <BrixSAt> im having kind of a ... maybe problem. i want to play some mp3 files in the browser (about 1 sec each file) trigered by the keypress but they usualy play a little late
[15:15:05] <BinaryKitten> you can store a reference to it as well
[15:15:35] <BinaryKitten> BrixSAt  how are you linking to the files?
[15:16:03] <BrixSAt> BinaryKitten:  im using  soundmanager2
[15:16:20] <abyssal> alright going to code that see if it works..
[15:16:23] <abyssal> brb.. thanks
[15:17:20] <BinaryKitten> never heard of that BrixSAt
[15:17:20] <BrixSAt> BinaryKitten:  i want to make the sound of a type writter everytime a key is pressed but.... some files play a alf a second or one sec later other play alright
[15:17:42] <BrixSAt> BinaryKitten:  it is a flash file that plays mp3 controlled by tons of js :)
[15:18:06] <BinaryKitten> ah right
[15:18:13] <BinaryKitten> can't help then sorry
[15:18:24] <BinaryKitten> need to see if it's the flash file
[15:18:35] <BinaryKitten> probably taking time to actually load the files
[15:18:42] <BinaryKitten> that would be my guess
[15:19:26] <BrixSAt> BinaryKitten:  :) is there a way to analyse performance of flash and js?
[15:20:44] <BinaryKitten> not that i know of
[15:20:50] <BrixSAt> =) thanks
[15:20:54] <BinaryKitten> you could put a console.log
[15:20:59] <BinaryKitten> to see when that happens
[15:21:10] <BinaryKitten> if it happsn at the right time then it's the flash

[16:13:45] <oojacoboo> would I have to call this function in the parent function in order to use that variable, or can that variable simply exist within the script?
[16:15:19] <oojacoboo> I mean, would that variable have to be accessible from the parent function
[16:25:45] <JmZ> hey
[16:25:56] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a way to find out how long text is?
[16:26:03] <waldmeister> strlen($text);
[16:26:14] <waldmeister> ah fuck..wrong channel :D
[16:26:16] <JmZ> lmfao
[16:26:19] <JmZ> .length
[16:26:23] <waldmeister> this is js and not php ^^
[16:26:26] <JohnnyDavidson> In pixels I mean
[16:26:31] <JmZ> oh
[16:26:37] <JohnnyDavidson> Wrapped in say, a span tag
[16:26:43] <JmZ> i guess you'd get the width of it
[16:26:45] <waldmeister> take the parent element and check .width
[16:26:56] <JohnnyDavidson> Does width auto update?
[16:27:04] <JohnnyDavidson> Like if you don't set it
[16:27:08] <JmZ> it is whatever the current width is
[16:27:14] <JmZ> yes if i understood you correctly
[16:27:15] <waldmeister> or calculated withquery probably provides some function to access that value
[16:27:17] <JohnnyDavidson> Alright cool thanks I'll try it out
[16:27:36] <JmZ> now i forgot what i was going to ask
[16:28:06] <JmZ> oh right, is there a way to do something on click of a <tr> but only if you didn't click a certain element in it
[16:28:16] <waldmeister> $('#element').width()
[16:28:25] <JohnnyDavidson> Worked!
[16:28:27] <JohnnyDavidson> Thank you
[16:28:44] <JmZ> e.g. you have a tr containing a couple of tds, some other random elements in those too. i wanna do some action if you click anywhere in the tr, except one of the TDs
[16:28:51] <waldmeister> you could probably use the findElement method of the event
[16:29:03] <waldmeister> and check what element was clicked on
[16:29:08] <JmZ> oh yeah
[16:30:25] <JmZ> ahh
[16:30:30] <JmZ> waldmeister: event.target
[16:30:54] <waldmeister> :)
[16:32:51] <Iszak> coldhead, you awake?
[16:42:42] <coldhead> hi Iszak
[16:43:45] <coldhead> hi seancurtis
[16:43:54] <coldhead> happy monday
[16:44:01] <seancurtis> happy monday to you too coldhead
[16:44:42] <seancurtis> was on the train this morning and there were a bunch of students discussing operating systems - one guy explaining how developing on a mac was easier than on windows
[16:44:46] <seancurtis> others were making fun of him
[16:44:50] <seancurtis> so I backed him up
[16:45:36] <seancurtis> "I'm a developer and I use a mac, so do most people in my company."
[16:45:41] <seancurtis> shut em up real fast
[16:46:16] <neteffect> apple sucks.  they spy on everything we do and have a worker ratio of like 100:1 china:us.  learn about apple and what they do.  don't ever support apple!
[16:46:31] <Iszak> coldhead, pm sexy tiem?
[16:47:23] <snover> neteffect: Was that sarcasm or are you really as nuts as that sounds? :)
[16:47:39] <neteffect> serious as cancer
[16:47:51] <neteffect> iphone spying, type it in
[16:47:58] <seancurtis> lolol
[16:48:00] <snover> Yeah, go ahead and never use any consumer electronics *ever* then, bro.
[16:48:09] <Iszak> /kick neteffect
[16:48:10] <nuba> are they the reptilians overlords, too?
[16:48:11] <seancurtis> neteffect: you know android phones had similar logging
[16:48:20] <neteffect> jus sayin.  i have to use apple stuff sometimes, yeah
[16:48:23] <snover> BUT ANDROID IS FROM GOOGLE AND GOOGLE COULD NEVER DO ANY EVIL
[16:48:27] <snover> IT’S RIGHT IN THEIR MOTTO
[16:48:28] <seancurtis> heh
[16:48:29] <neteffect> hehe
[16:48:38] <snover> YOU APPLE APOLOGIST
[16:48:49] <snover> STEVE JOBS RAPES BABIES PASS IT ON
[16:48:59] <Iszak> God forbid I'm thinking of buying a macbook air/pro.
[16:49:07] <seancurtis> snover: I reckon there's a small asterisk in that motto: "Don't be evil*" ... * to shareholders
[16:49:41] <waldmeister> only cause you find something on google doesn't mean it's true. I'm pretty sure I can search for "horse cocks are sexy" and find somethingand still they are not sexy
[16:49:54] <seancurtis> lol
[16:50:00] <coldhead> all acts are evil in some sense
[16:50:04] <coldhead> also inactivity
[16:50:13] <coldhead> their corporate motto is unpossible!
[16:50:39] <waldmeister> nothing is impossiblegoogle it :)
[16:50:41] <snover> what an interesting choice of things that are not sexy. It seems to imply that you have seen enough horse cocks to make up your mind on their level of sexiness, which makes me wonder…why are you spending all your time looking at horse cocks on the internet?
[16:51:18] <waldmeister> haha, I knew I should have gone with "unicorns are real" instead :D
[16:51:23] <seancurtis> haha
[16:51:42] <seancurtis> someone's gotta bash.org that
[16:51:48] <waldmeister> :D
[16:52:06] <waldmeister> I went with horse cocks because I figured you could relate to that easier than unicorns ;)
[16:52:41] <waldmeister> enough of thatapple rocks :)
[16:54:54] <coldhead> apple takes away your freedoms
[16:55:07] <snover> coldhead takes away your freedoms
[16:55:12] <snover> and replaces them with sweet sweet candy.
[17:21:22] <jacof> $('#small-menu-wrapper', '#logo.bar').wrapAll('<div id="header_bg" />'); <-- possible?
[17:22:59] <coldhead> you more likely want $('#small-menu-wrapper, #logo.bar')
[17:23:33] <jacof> not. $('#small-menu-wrapper').addClass("towrap"); $('#logo-bar').addClass("towrap"); $('.towrap').wrapAll('<div id="header_bg" />');
[17:23:36] <jacof> right ?
[17:24:07] <coldhead> that would work too
[17:24:09] <coldhead> but ew
[17:24:27] <jacof> ew
[17:38:13] <coldhead> oh my buddha
[17:46:30] <seancurtis> $('#small-menu-wrapper, #logo-bar').addClass('towrap).wrapAll('<div id="header_bg" />');
[17:46:44] <seancurtis> missed an '
[17:59:32] <JohnnyDavidson> If you delete a div for example, will all the event handlers also delete?
[18:00:44] <seancurtis> yes
[18:00:54] <seancurtis> I think there's an option not to however
[18:01:23] <pifantastic> ?remove @ JohnnyDavidson
[18:01:23] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[18:01:44] <pifantastic> use detach if you want to remove the element and preserve events
[18:02:31] <JohnnyDavidson> Well
[18:02:47] <JohnnyDavidson> The thing is, I'm trying to remove everything
[18:02:48] <JohnnyDavidson> all elements etc
[18:02:50] <JohnnyDavidson> from a div
[18:02:58] <JohnnyDavidson> Right now I'm just using .html('');
[18:03:22] <JohnnyDavidson> Although it seems kind of lazy, is there any downside to it?
[18:14:51] <eveningsky> I know I can use .done or .success to wait for an ajax call to finished, but how do I tell when the .success function is finished?
[18:16:19] <seancurtis> eveningsky: you read up on promise?
[18:16:24] <seancurtis> ? promise
[18:16:25] <bot-t> seancurtis, .promise() - Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[18:17:50] <eveningsky> seancurtis: I've been reading as much as I can find on them. but the promise returned by an ajax request only shows when the request is finished.
[18:18:25] <seancurtis> even if you put the promise in the .success?
[18:18:56] <seancurtis> I'm not familiar with .promise() or .success - I just know that they exist and it's probably what you're after :)
[18:22:09] <eveningsky> seancurtis: yeah thanks. I'm pretty sure that's what I'm after too, but the documentation is worthless and what I can find about it in google is only a little bit better.
[18:23:02] <seancurtis> eveningsky: do up a proof of concept demo on jsfiddle or jsbin and then ask for advice here :)
[18:24:12] <eveningsky> As a concept deferreds make perfect sense and sound really easy, but when I start trying to actually write the code, the implementation makes my head spin.
[18:26:11] <snover> eveningsky: javascript is single-threaded. after the ajax request, promises are resolved in the order they were attached.
[18:26:24] <snover> there is no “after the success function”…anything
[18:26:41] <snover> if you want to do shit after the success function, call that shit from the success function. or add it to the promise.
[18:27:56] <eveningsky> hmm.
[18:28:32] <javajosh> is there any way for jquery to do a xss https call from a local html document?
[18:29:09] <javajosh> this is perhaps more of a browser question. however i'm using jquery so i thought i'd ask here.
[18:29:21] <seancurtis> javajosh: you mean xhr not xss right?
[18:29:47] <javajosh> kinda - i actually want to hit an amazon server over https from a file:// URL
[18:29:51] <seancurtis> I'd say you can't do an xhr call to a local html document because of xss issues :)
[18:30:20] <seancurtis> javajosh: I'd be scared if my browser let that happen
[18:30:36] <javajosh> my document is loaded locally, the xhr call is remote
[18:30:49] <seancurtis> so I open an html file on my desktop and it calls out to some website and does shit via ajax? no thanks
[18:31:05] <seancurtis> I'd be scared if that was possible
[18:31:27] <seancurtis> I know there were ways to do that with css files as there's no cross domain restrictions on that
[18:31:27] <javajosh> to each his own. but realize that loading a local html file and running it like a progaram is not inherently different than running any other program
[18:31:38] <snover> javajosh: no. you can not perform remote requests like that.
[18:31:44] <seancurtis> people were putting JS in CSS files and parsing them with JS or osmething
[18:32:35] <seancurtis> javajosh: loading a local html file and running it like a program is fine - but I'd expect it to run in a sandbox and not allow outside servers to communicate with it :/
[18:32:52] <seancurtis> but yeah - what snover said - no :)
[18:36:44] <javajosh> @sean: actually, it works
[18:37:08] <javajosh> load this in a local file
[18:37:09] <javajosh> $(function() {
[18:37:09] <javajosh>   var string = $.get("http://jquery.com", function(data){
[18:37:09] <javajosh>     $('body').html(data);
[18:37:09] <javajosh>   }, 'html');
[18:37:10] <javajosh> });
[18:39:30] <snover> ?p @ javajosh
[18:39:30] <coldhead> that sure doesn't work for me
[18:39:30] <bot-t> javajosh, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:40:28] <javajosh> oh, sorry bot
[18:41:03] <javajosh> although
[18:41:20] <javajosh> this particular code cannot be run on the internet
[18:41:30] <javajosh> it is specifically a file:// url question only
[18:41:31] <equinox__> does anyone here know what jQuery function to use if I want to limit a text input so that a user can't type in more than 3 characters?
[18:42:02] <javajosh> return false from change() event
[18:48:16] <eveningsky> @snover. should this work? http://jsfiddle.net/4ZzqC/
[18:51:10] <snover> why are you creating your own deferred? just return the one from the xhr call.
[18:52:30] <snover> also, I don’t know anything about the superfluous aliases to .then that have been introduced so…does promise.done exist? i have no idea.
[18:53:21] <eveningsky> @snover. Because the one returned by the xhr is already resolved, by the time the success function starts
[18:54:02] <snover> you can attach functions to already-resolved promises and they will still execute.
[18:54:06] <snover> they just execute immediately.
[18:54:08] <eveningsky> snover: I'm only interested in the end of the success function because the dom manipulation takes too long.
[18:54:13] <snover> ?!??!?!
[18:54:16] <snover> what are you trying to do.
[18:55:13] <eveningsky> I'm trying to show/hide/move some stuff that is added to the dom by the success function of the xhr.
[18:55:36] <eveningsky> but it isn't there yet, event though the xhr promise has been returned.
[18:57:52] <snover> http://jsfiddle.net/4ZzqC/1/
[19:01:07] <emergion> hey all, if an item is draggable, should it be automatically removed after it is dropped on a "droppable" item?
[19:03:02] <eveningsky> snover: The whole idea is I want to be able to say, "If these dom objects aren't here yet, go call this XHR function. Otherwise start moving 'em"
[19:03:24] <eveningsky> as far as I can tell, that's exactly the idea of promises.
[19:03:43] <Techdeck> anyone knows if it's somehow possible to build a webapp with offline audio playback?
[19:04:06] <snover> um. the idea of promises is that they provide a mechanism for performing asynchronous function calls in a way that is as similar as possible to synchronous function calls
[19:04:31] <snover> if (check()) { callXhr().then(moveSomeBitches); } else { moveSomeBitches(); }
[19:06:37] <eveningsky> snover: yeah, I think that could work.
[19:06:51] <snover> alternatively
[19:07:26] <snover> $.when(checkSomeBitches(), moveSomeBitches); where checkSomeBitches returns either the bitches or the deferred from the XHR
[19:10:04] <eveningsky> snover: yeah, I think that get's back to the original problem that the XHR doesn't ensure the objects are ready to move.
[19:12:10] <eveningsky> and the first suggestion has the same problem too.
[19:12:11] <snover> again, that shit executes in the order functions are attached, so checkSomeBitches() would look like if (thing) return thing; else return $.xhr().then(buildSomeBitches);
[19:12:23] <snover> first buildSomeBitches is called, then moveSomeBitches is called
[19:13:07] <eveningsky> I see what your after
[19:14:26] <eveningsky> but how do I keep buildSomeBitches from being called more than once?
[19:14:58] <snover> why would that happen?
[19:15:22] <eveningsky> cuz this whole thing is happening after an onhashchange event
[19:15:24] <snover> sorry let me fix that for you
[19:15:33] <snover> checkSomeBitches() would look like if (bitches) return bitches; else return $.xhr().then(buildSomeBitches);
[19:16:02] <snover> clearly my bitches metaphor was not being evenly applied
[19:16:09] <snover> and that led to confusion
[19:16:37] <defaultro> good evening folks, I need help on displaying a number rather than displaying it as drop down
[19:16:42] <eveningsky> thanks. confusion lifting slowly....i think
[19:17:28] <defaultro> i have a select option html tag and it contains 3 values, 16, 24 and 30. I want it to look like the number from a digital clock. How do I do it?
[19:19:04] <defaultro> and when I click the number, it will scroll through all those 3 numbers
[19:39:08] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hey
[19:39:10] <Nicolas_Leonida2> http://jsfiddle.net/Aj3mQ/
[19:39:19] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I'm trying to remove the hidden elements with the same name as the checkboxes
[19:39:31] <Nicolas_Leonida2> but it does not iterate through checkbox inputs, what am I doing wrong?
[19:41:47] <echoSMILE> people at work tell me, jquery don't work fine in all browser like prototype does. this is right, not all right, completely wrong?
[19:44:04] <coldhead> Nicolas_Leonida2: http://jsfiddle.net/Aj3mQ/1/
[19:45:50] <coldhead> Nicolas_Leonida2: http://jsfiddle.net/Aj3mQ/3/
[19:45:59] <coldhead> that's much more efficient :D
[19:46:47] <coldhead> echoSMILE: i believe jQUery supports more browsers than prototype, it certainly has more people testing and debugging
[19:47:02] <coldhead> echoSMILE: i suspect people at your work are mouthbreathers
[19:47:16] <Nicolas_Leonida2> coldhead: thank you very much
[19:47:39] <Nicolas_Leonida2> echoSMILE: I've never had a problem like that, those people are haters!
[19:49:04] <echoSMILE> i see.
[19:49:54] <echoSMILE> tks
[20:05:01] <WebDragon> hey folks, anyone around for a quick consult? http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/menus/sunday-brunch-menu/  the script at http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/wp-content/themes/caffegelato/js/menu_collapse.js
[20:05:44] <WebDragon> at line 14 I have > .prepend("<span class='collapsebox'> &#x21f2;</span>")
[20:06:12] <WebDragon> on some browsers, the ⇲ is not being inserted correctly and doesn't become visible until after the user clicks the header
[20:06:28] <WebDragon> however in its absence, the option to click them individually may not be immediately apparent
[20:06:49] <WebDragon> I'm wondering if there's any particular reason for it to fail that I may have overlooked
[20:07:23] <WebDragon> I've about exhausted my albiet limited debugging skills in determining why the other inserts work fine, but this does not
[20:09:48] <WebDragon> any assistance would be much appreciated
[20:10:27] <WebDragon> http://caffegelato.net/html/menu_brunch.html same dang script was working fine previously at the old site (the above is the ongoing makeover)
[20:12:09] <zeta-> I've forgotten if IE6 can use multiple classes. If not does jQuery get round this?
[20:12:27] <donCams> who uses IE6?
[20:12:43] <Techdeck> 70
[20:12:46] <Techdeck> 70+ people*
[20:13:02] <coldhead> 70s people
[20:13:08] <donCams> that's like .0000(n)%
[20:15:16] <zeta-> donCams: writing a module for people to use, who won't use it if it doesn't support ie6
[20:15:53] <WebDragon> both are using the same version of jquery
[20:15:59] <zeta-> WebDragon: nice code folding! but I missed the problem
[20:16:02] <WebDragon> so I have no idea why it would work on one page but not work on another
[20:16:05] <WebDragon> thanks zeta :D
[20:16:15] <WebDragon> sorta proud of that one even if it's a bit inefficient
[20:16:31] <WebDragon> zeta-: lemme pastebin rather than repaste
[20:16:52] <zeta-> 8-)
[20:17:06] <WebDragon> http://fpaste.org/3kd1/raw/  one of the lines is rather long but there's everything
[20:17:37] <cccaldas> guys, i have a javascript OOP question, can i ask here ?
[20:18:09] <cccaldas> ?
[20:18:16] <WebDragon> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference  is a good place to start
[20:18:44] <WebDragon> if it's not specifically jquery related. someone may know the answer here and be feeling generous, so ask away I say
[20:19:28] <WebDragon> there's a ##javascript channel here on freenode for more generic questions regarding js
[20:19:30] <AllStruck> and there is ##javascript
[20:19:42] <donCams> he's gone
[20:19:52] * WebDragon taps his claws on the desktop with some tsk'ing going on verbally
[20:20:03] <WebDragon> yeah I saw
[20:20:07] <WebDragon> oh well
[20:20:09] <WebDragon> ahh
[20:20:13] <donCams> he's back
[20:20:14] <donCams> :)
[20:20:23] <WebDragon> cccaldas: there's a ##javascript channel for more generic js questions though
[20:20:25] <donCams> cccaldas, don't ask to ask. just ask and someone will help
[20:20:40] <donCams> yeah, there's also ##javascript
[20:20:52] <WebDragon> but if they're dead at the moment, we might be able to help or at least point you to the relevant portion of the MDC
[20:21:27] <cccaldas> WebDragon: yeap, i joined :) thkx
[20:21:32] * WebDragon qualifies this statement by noting that he's a programmer by trade but only conversant with the bits of js that I actualy am forced to use when there's not something jquery does for me already =)
[20:21:58] <cccaldas> donCams: well, i prefer ask first, because i already had problems :(
[20:22:06] <cccaldas> donCams: but thkx, im on javascript channel...
[20:22:28] <donCams> np :) odd enough, I learned jQuery first before javascript. haha
[20:23:12] <donCams> that's how jQuery makes js easy -rawr-
[20:24:31] <coldhead> that's a Nice Thing about jQuery
[20:24:44] <coldhead> lowers the cross browser entry barrier
[20:24:52] <donCams> yes yes. i agree
[20:25:02] <WebDragon> donCams: mostly same thing here. I'd dabbled with js before and with prototype a little bit, but jquery made the insane stuff so simple it was astonishing
[20:25:19] <coldhead> well put
[20:25:21] <WebDragon> zeta-: so, any ideas about my problem?
[20:25:44] * WebDragon kickstarts the bottomless coffeepot and awaits enlightenment in one form or another
[20:26:04] <WebDragon> (nominally because my coffee is so good it nearly qualifies as enlightenment on its own)
[20:26:25] <donCams> what 229kb of code can do for your life. awesome
[20:28:23] * WebDragon wonders if his problem put zeta to sleep
[20:28:33] <donCams> WebDragon: what's the problem?
[20:28:38] <zeta-> WebDragon: initially thought some browsers might not display new images -- but they're not images
[20:28:59] <WebDragon> zeta-: no, they're fonts. from the utf8 charset which IS supported by that particular font
[20:29:16] <WebDragon> donCams: http://fpaste.org/3kd1/raw/ pastebin of my question earlier
[20:29:48] <WebDragon> I'm getting similar behaviour in opera/chrome/firefox (all currentrelease) -- jquery is at 163
[20:29:52] <zeta-> WebDragon: similar problem for fonts?
[20:29:59] <WebDragon> not sure what you mean
[20:30:31] <WebDragon> it's a character in the utf8-charset which is present in the font being used (which is easily provable once you click on the header twice and then the char is visible)
[20:30:40] <AllStruck> I think you are getting a cufon conflict
[20:30:52] <WebDragon> initially when the page loads, the span.collapsebox html element is empty
[20:31:48] <WebDragon> if you inspect the element, the &#x21f2; is just not even present
[20:32:39] <WebDragon> it's double-quoted everywhere else, so I know it's not some weird interpretation going on
[20:33:26] <WebDragon> and if you look at the original site, the script works cleanly
[20:33:38] <WebDragon> you may be right, allstruck, that it's a cufon conflict. hm
[20:33:50] <zeta-> WebDragon: you are also adding a class, could you use h2.opened:before{content: '&#x21f2;';}
[20:33:51] <WebDragon> maybe the cufon doesn't have that segment of the charset present
[20:33:54] <AllStruck> not sure...
[20:34:08] <AllStruck> It's the first difference I noticed in the working / non
[20:34:21] <WebDragon> it's quite possible that the original wordpress theme author didn't build the cufons with a full charset
[20:34:38] <AllStruck> it seems like a problem with not waiting for pageload but I'm still not sure
[20:34:42] <WebDragon> which would be irritating beyond belief
[20:34:52] <AllStruck> well it works after clicking
[20:35:05] <WebDragon> yeah because live.click is adding/removing it
[20:35:17] <WebDragon> and it's NOT being intercepted by cufon at that point
[20:35:30] <WebDragon> good catch, is my guess. I'll investigate that avenue
[20:35:38] <AllStruck> right, something to that effect was my thought
[20:35:40] <WebDragon> and hope I don't have to rebuild the damn cufons
[20:35:49] <AllStruck> good luck
[20:36:06] <WebDragon> heh. I need more than luck. this makeover's been one facepalm after another
[20:36:28] <WebDragon> surprised my face hasn't deformed with a facepalm indent at this point
[20:36:50] <WebDragon> zeta-: in the css you mean?
[20:37:00] <zeta-> yes
[20:37:15] <fooquery> Hey people - what is the best way to use jquery to reapply -webkit-mask* properties after updating the .text() content? Right now the mask gets lost - weird?
[20:37:38] <AllStruck> at least you have it working somewhere already, that helps find the problem a lot quicker
[20:37:39] <WebDragon> actually I think I may have tried that or something similar way back when I was first creating that script
[20:37:51] <WebDragon> AllStruck: indeed.
[20:37:56] <ryanseddon> fooquery: you got a testcase that sounds like a rendering bug
[20:38:06] <fooquery> so I have a <span class="I-haz-a-mask">D:</span> and when I change that to <span class="I-haz-a-mask">G:</span> the mask is lost :s
[20:39:15] <zeta-> WebDragon: you are trying to prepend it -- but it's at the end -- then you position it to before with css
[20:39:36] <WebDragon> well .. hmm
[20:39:53] <zeta-> also why has each &#x21f2; got a space in front?
[20:40:12] <WebDragon> that I don't recall LOL
[20:40:29] <fooquery> Sufferin' succotash - well at least there is a work-around.
[20:41:01] <zeta-> maybe they used to be at the end, so needed a space
[20:41:03] <WebDragon> wait
[20:41:25] <WebDragon> it's definitely the cufon -- you can see the ⇲ briefly in the flash of unstyled content before the cufon takes hold
[20:41:28] <WebDragon> and then it's gone
[20:41:32] <fooquery> ⇲ is nice
[20:41:36] <WebDragon> yeah
[20:41:49] <fooquery> WebDragon: what are you working on?
[20:41:51] <WebDragon> ⇱ and ⇲ make a nice indicator
[20:42:07] <fooquery> I arrived after link
[20:42:23] <WebDragon> fooquery: expand/collapse menu script for a restaurant menu to show just the headings of the sections at first, with each being clickable, and an expand-all button at the top
[20:42:33] <WebDragon> http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/menus/sunday-brunch-menu/
[20:42:48] <fooquery> So one question remains -
[20:42:51] <fooquery> are you a real dragon?
[20:42:53] <WebDragon> quite proud of the results. it's reasonably elegant
[20:42:57] <Dollz> F--K fvvK F^^^^^^^^^KKKKKKK !!!!
[20:43:02] <Dollz> Help me GUYYYYS
[20:43:10] <WebDragon> fooquery: I am a Coffee Dragon }B=&]
[20:43:20] <Dollz> js> "HELP MEEEEE"
[20:43:21] <WebDragon> extremely rare breed
[20:43:31] <zeta-> wierdly I'm also making code folding (& accordions & tabs etc) but no js! well just a bit of jQuery to support ie6+
[20:43:36] <WebDragon> Dollz: chill. don't ask to ask, just ask
[20:43:41] <fooquery> I like how you styled the viralcons. The google+ icon looks nice as it colourifies up on mouse over
[20:43:55] <WebDragon> yeah my boss did the artwork for those
[20:44:10] <WebDragon> he does most of the front-end design work. I do the under the hood stuff
[20:44:33] <WebDragon> we're trying to get more makeover work and less 'fix my existing site, I don't want to pay for a modern-looking site right now' client
[20:45:04] <WebDragon> we've got tons of that in the portfolio, and not nearly enough sweet-ass designs to woo new clients with
[20:45:25] <WebDragon> but it pays the bills, and we're good at fixing the 'broeken' stuff
[20:45:29] <WebDragon> *chuckle*
[20:45:51] <Dollz> in a plugin , where I wrote my code inside a form.submit( >> ajax {  >>> success ()  { MY CODE HERE  } }) ... THIS CODE doesn't break from the form.submit() , neither sees any other variables from outside .... I'M GONE NUTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[20:46:16] <WebDragon> <-- is particularly a real pisser about trying to do things _right_ the first time so I don't have to go back and do it again and again later (or worse, can't figure out wtf I did to make it work the last time, 6 months later)
[20:46:32] * WebDragon is only human though
[20:46:35] <WebDragon> mostly
[20:46:36] <Dollz> I face this problem on DAILY BASIS !!!! I MUST SOLVE ITTTTTTTT
[20:46:54] <Dollz> Or I will bomb this room
[20:47:09] * WebDragon passes the Dollz a hefty jigger of whiskey
[20:47:20] <Dollz> WebDragon: whatever
[20:47:34] <WebDragon> seriously man you'll get better responses if you're more chill about it
[20:47:43] <WebDragon> we know how it is when you're at crunch time and shit's not working
[20:47:55] <Dollz> sorry guys , I'm really so mad of this error !!!
[20:48:04] <coldhead> Dollz: you understand that the first A in AJAX is for Asynchronous, meaning it goes off and takes its own damn time, right?
[20:48:04] <WebDragon> and it's 11;47 on sunday night and you're still plugging away at shit
[20:48:11] <coldhead> the rest of your script won't wait
[20:48:32] <Dollz> coldhead: yes , I'm doing the action in $.ajax -> success method
[20:48:50] <coldhead> can you explain the problem better then?
[20:49:02] <coldhead> with a pastebin of your code/
[20:49:06] <coldhead> ?*
[20:49:09] <zeta-> 04:47 here!
[20:49:20] <WebDragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YURj2x0do_M  appropriate mood music for your present situation, Dollz
[20:49:30] <WebDragon> (just came up in my randomizer) xD
[20:50:34] <Dollz> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/MXxeRDGE ,,,,,,  SEE LINE 203
[20:50:47] <Dollz> WebDragon:  :)
[20:51:08] <Dollz> coldhead: this ajax request is inside a from.submit() handler
[20:51:42] <coldhead> and what's not working?
[20:51:43] <Dollz> coldhead: I need this ajax success method to call a callback function instead of doing it's sh!tty stuffs
[20:52:10] <Dollz> coldhead: I can't break from the form.submit() handler even
[20:52:21] <coldhead> this is where i lose you
[20:52:24] <coldhead> "break"?
[20:52:28] <Dollz> coldhead: neither see options variable [that has all options passed to plugin]
[20:52:34] <Dollz> coldhead: sorry, return false;
[20:52:43] <Dollz> it's not a loop
[20:52:46] <Dollz> :)
[20:52:50] <coldhead> do you want to cancel the submit?
[20:52:54] <coldhead> or something?
[20:53:00] <coldhead> I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[20:53:23] <Dollz> coldhead: it's cancelled anyway , I want to cancel the actions of success(), and pass a callback function to be called with the server response
[20:53:49] <Dollz> instead of this method actions , I can not customize it at
[20:54:04] <coldhead> >_>
[20:54:17] <Dollz> coldhead: what this >_> means ?
[20:54:17] <coldhead> NO TIENDE
[20:54:31] <coldhead> i think i am too stupid to help you, Dollz
[20:54:35] <coldhead> i can't understand the problem
[20:54:45] <coldhead> if you want to call another function can't you just call another function?
[20:55:00] <coldhead> maybe add some comments to your code to explain the problem better
[20:55:06] <coldhead> i am still learning english sorry
[20:55:16] <Dollz> coldhead: Ah k ,,
[20:55:59] <WebDragon> Dollz: >_> and similar are anime-ways of expressing smilies
[20:56:04] <WebDragon> ^_^ etc
[20:56:21] <Dollz> WebDragon: Ah , so coldhead is asian ?
[20:56:27] <WebDragon> not necessarily

[20:59:24] <Dollz> Murugaratham: cookies
[20:59:41] <Dollz> guys , you think jquery is a wizard !!! wtffff
[21:00:08] <WebDragon> no, WE are wizards. jquery is the secret sauce
[21:00:14] <WebDragon> =8)
[21:00:51] <Dollz> WebDragon: :)
[21:02:00] <donCams> Resig is god
[21:02:19] <TeddyMurray> hey im trying to use .complete() on a post method but im getting this error:
[21:02:47] <Dollz> donCams: nope, there is only one God .. the one that I worship =))
[21:02:51] <TeddyMurray> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'complete'
[21:03:21] <donCams> no issue there. nwei, lunchtime for me
[21:04:26] <Dollz> donCams: bon apetitte , or what ever it is written
[21:10:30] <heshanh> hey guys when im using the UI datepicker why cant i set a default value. on the text field when i set a value="2011-10-10" it shows nothing
[21:16:01] <WebDragon> yup, if I disable cufon in the theme options interface, I get my doohicky back ⇲
[21:16:26] <WebDragon> I tried creating a new cufon using the original site, and adding the two characters I needed -- apparently they are just not in that font, period
[21:19:47] <snover> it’s 2011, time to dump cufon and use woff
[21:20:23] <Dollz> GUYS !!!! why I lose context with EVERY THING !!!! when I'm inside a $.ajax({})
[21:20:39] <WebDragon> "unicode-range":"U+0020-U+2122" *facepalm*
[21:20:52] <WebDragon> and naturally ⇲ is at 21f2
[21:21:03] <Dollz> I can not read/write/delete  any variable in the global context (window)
[21:21:11] <WebDragon> snover: go go gadget googlefonts
[21:21:29] <snover> WebDragon: wut?
[21:21:42] <Dollz> snover use google fonts better
[21:21:43] <heshanh> gooogle fonts :D
[21:21:43] <WebDragon> snover: vague reference to Inspector Gadget
[21:21:48] <seancurtis> Dollz: you're putting stuff in global variables?
[21:21:50] <WebDragon> those are woff, IIRC
[21:21:51] <snover> google web fonts are woff.
[21:21:53] <WebDragon> aren't they?
[21:21:59] <WebDragon> thought so
[21:22:05] <Dollz> seancurtis: yes, who can stop me !?
[21:22:05] <heshanh> yep
[21:22:17] * WebDragon blinks
[21:22:27] <seancurtis> $.ajax() obviously
[21:22:40] <WebDragon> seancurtis: couldn't have said it better myself
[21:22:40] <Dollz> seancurtis: seems so
[21:22:40] <heshanh> lol
[21:22:41] * WebDragon falls off the floor laughing
[21:22:51] <Dollz> :)
[21:22:58] <WebDragon> and before anyone asks, it's easy: you miss.
[21:23:14] <Dollz> LoL
[21:24:09] <Dollz> I put it on window.VAR to access  it from that ugly 'success' method
[21:24:10] <snover> As I understand it, that is the secret to flying.
[21:24:33] <Dollz> I hate ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
[21:24:45] <snover> learn how closures work.
[21:25:00] <donCams> i love closures
[21:25:09] <Dollz> snover: I read about it 3 years before .. I'm fine with it
[21:25:26] <Dollz> before = ago
[21:25:45] <snover> um…somehow I’m not quite believing that if you are sticking things on the global to access them later
[21:26:14] <Dollz> snover: should I put them on objects instead ?
[21:26:27] <snover> I shouldn’t have said a thing.
[21:26:28] <Dollz> I'm not using OOP
[21:26:34] <snover> sooooo, pretend I didn’t.
[21:26:43] <Dollz> i'm using procedural javascript
[21:26:49] <Dollz> although every thing in js is an object
[21:26:59] <Dollz> I know before anyone says anything
[21:27:33] <Dollz> well, not every thing
[21:27:44] <Dollz> or is it everything ?
[21:27:49] <Dollz> I don't care ...
[21:27:59] <Dollz> I care about this annoyingGGGGG problem ...
[21:28:06] <snover> hey I have an annoying problem too
[21:28:14] <Dollz> snover: I guess it's me
[21:28:20] <snover> YOU GOT IT!
[21:28:26] <Dollz> snover: I'm smart , huh ?
[21:28:30] <seancurtis> snover: thought it was that rash?
[21:29:02] <snover> seancurtis: speak english man.
[21:29:25] <seancurtis> your annoying problem > rash?
[21:29:26] <WebDragon> oh HELL yes. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kin0pLtisbw  was TOTALLY in the mood for this. THANK YOU CLEMENTINE RANDOMIZER
[21:29:38] <Dollz> rash ?
[21:29:42] <Dollz> what rash means ?
[21:29:51] <Dollz> rush maybe ?
[21:29:59] * seancurtis sighs and goes back to his cave
[21:30:04] <cypha> is it secure to logout using ajax?
[21:30:11] <snover> maybe!
[21:30:14] <neteffect> can i make a picture slide to the left and a new one come in and take it's place?
[21:30:24] <Dollz> cypha: NOOOOO THEY WILL HACK THE HELLL OUT OF YOUR WEBSITEEEEEEEE
[21:30:41] <WebDragon> enjoy some blues, people. Warren Mendonsa is a HELL of a player
[21:30:42] <Dollz> neteffect: why not .. do it
[21:30:47] <neteffect> heh
[21:31:12] <cypha> can't tell if you were being sincere
[21:31:17] <tomasm-> is it possible to have an event triggered when any form field on a form changes? is that form.onchange?
[21:31:25] <heshanh> its all good as long as u kill all the sessions
[21:31:25] <Dollz> cypha: hmmm , nope
[21:31:39] <snover> tomasm-: there is no event that fires on the form itself.
[21:31:46] <TeddyMurray> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'complete'
[21:31:53] <TeddyMurray> anyone familiar with this error?
[21:32:00] <Dollz> snover: there is , it's submit
[21:32:07] <TeddyMurray> doing $.post().complete(function() { } );
[21:32:08] <tomasm-> how would i get an event to trigger when arbitrary fields of a form are changed?
[21:32:29] <Dollz> tomasm-: $(field).change(Function(){})
[21:32:42] <Dollz> tomasm-: I guess you want it the jquery way
[21:32:49] <Dollz> becuase you are in #jquery
[21:32:49] <tomasm-> Dollz, yeah of course, but this is 'any field within a form'
[21:32:59] <tomasm-> not just a specific one
[21:33:07] <Dollz> tomasm-: ANY FIELD ?
[21:33:15] <tomasm-> yes
[21:33:19] <Dollz> then use this $(form field).change()
[21:33:35] <Dollz> field = field type
[21:33:54] <Dollz> like $('#form1 input[type="text"]).change()
[21:33:59] <seancurtis> neteffect: you could do it with JS and some css animations, or if you want the effect everywhere you could use pure JS or you could use a JS transition/animation script to use CSS3 or fallback to JS if it doesn't exist
[21:34:01] <WebDragon> god DAMN what a solo.
[21:34:21] <neteffect> oh
[21:34:26] <neteffect> i wanted something simple lol
[21:34:28] <Dollz> tomasm-: SELECTORS !!
[21:34:28] <WebDragon> folks if you like blues, you have GOT to check this guy out. holy shhhhhhnitzel
[21:34:34] <Dollz> tomasm-: ARE THE KEY
[21:34:39] <WebDragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kin0pLtisbw
[21:34:42] <tomasm-> Dollz, you're shouting at me!
[21:34:43] <snover> WebDragon: bro
[21:34:50] <snover> I appreciate how much you love that music
[21:34:53] <snover> but this is not #music
[21:35:01] <WebDragon> this just totally improved my mood while futzing with this code
[21:35:11] <WebDragon> only reason it was relevant at all :)
[21:35:19] <neteffect> what is the simplest way to slide a picture to the left as another one comes in?  maybe jpg animation?
[21:35:30] <WebDragon> neteffect: lots of jquery sliders out there
[21:35:34] <Dollz> I don't know why do you like this kind of music ... nothing better than arabian music , rap & hipHop
[21:35:36] <seancurtis> neteffect: did you see my comment above?
[21:35:44] <snover> neteffect: yes, definitely go and animate a jpg and get back to use when you are done
[21:35:46] <neteffect> sory lemme reread
[21:35:47] <neteffect> heh
[21:35:50] <neteffect> oh hehe
[21:35:54] <Dollz> blues and greens and sh~~t
[21:36:15] <WebDragon> Dollz: I have such varied and eclectic tastes you'd be more amused by what's NOT included in my listening than by what IS. but I digress...
[21:37:22] <Dollz> WebDragon: good , do you listen to oriental music ?
[21:37:30] <Dollz> WebDragon: arabic one ?
[21:37:49] <danheberden> less digressing, moar jqueries
[21:37:52] <WebDragon> Avial is one of my current new favorites to come out of India lately
[21:37:59] <WebDragon> danheberden: agreed.
[21:38:07] * WebDragon moves the music to the back burner
[21:38:35] * WebDragon apologizes for having initiated the digression. wasn't intentional. just had a mood-altering experience while I wrestle with this code is all :)
[21:39:14] <Dollz> indian ?  grrr , don't like it
[21:39:59] <Dollz> I don't know either why ppl tend  think arabians & indians are the same ....
[21:40:07] <Dollz> to*
[21:40:15] <snover> it’s ok webdragon, it allows me to share *my* favourite song of all time, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BI0szjpxJs

[21:40:35] <TeddyMurray> how do you do a callback on a post
[21:40:38] <TeddyMurray> even if it fails
[21:41:54] <WebDragon> http://www.blackstratblues.com/  guy has all his music from two albums available for download in every format imaginable with a paypal button if you enjoy the stuff. this is also the BEST i've seen WRT downloadable/payfor I've seen on the web to date, period.

[21:46:11] * WebDragon shoots cufon in the foot and goes to msg his boss to ask whether he can switch over to use googlefonts at this late stage in the site work
[21:46:29] <WebDragon> makin me look bad like my scripts don't work
[21:47:06] <seancurtis> WebDragon: just make cufon fall back to Comic Sans and tell your boss that's how it'll look if you don't use Google fonts instead :)
[21:47:06] * Dollz has lost 1/3 of his hair ..
[21:48:13] * WebDragon falls off the floor laughing
[21:48:22] <Dollz> how can I access outside variables from $.ajax({}) ???
[21:48:23] <WebDragon> seancurtis++
[21:48:36] <neteffect> :D
[21:48:50] * Dollz can not see what is funny in that
[21:49:07] * Dollz let me know to laugh with you guys
[21:49:09] <WebDragon> Dollz: the humor in that comes with experience
[21:50:01] <Dollz> WebDragon: then , why neteffect laughs then , he was asking 5 minutes back , and seems that he has no experience
[21:50:07] <WebDragon> and the overabundance of comicsans usage around the web for forever until stuff like this started happening: http://sixrevisions.com/graphics-design/comic-sans-the-font-everyone-loves-to-hate/
[21:50:28] <WebDragon> experience with jquery/javascript does not exclude experience elsewhere on the web
[21:50:40] <WebDragon> or preclude, for that matter
[21:50:49] <WebDragon> or the absence thereof
[21:51:03] * WebDragon stops before he gets himself into a recursive timeloop
[21:51:07] <Dollz> WebDragon: I bet neteffect doesn't know anything in anything ......
[21:51:19] <Dollz> neteffect: :p
[21:51:22] * WebDragon has learned the hard way not to make generalizations of that nature
[21:51:36] <WebDragon> there's some frighteningly smart people around here on freenode
[21:51:42] <seancurtis> bet he'd know how to handle data effectively inside a $.ajax() call though
[21:51:51] <Dollz> WebDragon: yes I knoiw , because i'm here
[21:51:51] <WebDragon> ignorance of a subject is not indicative of intelligence
[21:51:51] <seancurtis> :P
[21:52:24] <Dollz> seancurtis: oh , then tell me how , let me go !
[21:52:33] <Dollz> I'll stop bothering you
[21:52:46] <seancurtis> Dollz: use a closure :)
[21:53:21] <Dollz> seancurtis: a closure is a function inside another function ...
[21:53:23] <Dollz> so what ?
[21:55:19] <seancurtis> setup a code sample on jsfiddle or something - then people can explain what you're doing wrong - simply saying "I can't work with blah" means that in order to help you fix it people feel like they have to teach you all about "blah" in order to do so and often "blah" is complex and too time consuming to explain so they just ignore you :)
[21:55:40] <WebDragon> someone add that to bot-t when he gets back
[21:55:45] <WebDragon> that's brilliantly phrased
[21:55:48] <WebDragon> xD
[21:55:50] * WebDragon runs
[21:57:07] <Dollz> seancurtis: oh !
[21:57:23] <bufferxyz> hi query newbie here, I am not even sure how to ask. I am just wondering if there is a way to do DOM insert AFTER DOM replaceWith is done
[21:57:37] <Dollz> seancurtis: you are right !
[21:58:03] <bufferxyz> and the DOM insert will be inserting to the new DOM elements that just got replaced with
[21:58:10] <bufferxyz> I am not sure if I made myself clear..
[22:00:22] <Dollz> bufferxyz: you want to insert data into a replaced element ?
[22:00:36] <bufferxyz> Dollz: yes,
[22:00:49] <Dollz> bufferxyz: what is the problem then /
[22:00:51] <bufferxyz> Dollz: that's why it has to be after replaceWIth is finished
[22:01:13] <bufferxyz> Dollz: So I didn't know if I should use trigger or any other method to do this task
[22:01:22] <Dollz> bufferxyz: hmmm , then put the insert command after the replace one :)
[22:01:25] <heshanh> non JQ question, what irc client do u guys use? mirc fonts are just way toooo chunky
[22:01:37] <Dollz> heshanh: chatzilla
[22:01:38] <WebDragon> heshanh: xchat
[22:01:49] <WebDragon> opera's chat client builtin is also decent
[22:01:52] <WebDragon> no need for a download
[22:02:05] <bufferxyz> Dollz:  oh I forgot to mention that , the replaceWith method is called whenever a radio selector is changed
[22:02:07] <WebDragon> (I still dunno how they manage to keep that browser install so small with all the stuff it comes with)
[22:02:09] <Dollz> any one can look into this code ? http://jsfiddle.net/Me8fs/
[22:02:13] <heshanh> something that runs on windows
[22:02:22] <Dollz> seancurtis: http://jsfiddle.net/Me8fs/
[22:02:23] <bufferxyz> so that means it's not strictly a linear timeline
[22:02:35] <WebDragon> heshanh: xchat's available for windows and opera's client and chatzilla+firefox runs in the browser
[22:02:48] <seancurtis> bufferxyz: can you whip up an example in a jsfiddle of what you're doing? Much easier for people to understand that way
[22:03:00] <Dollz> bufferxyz: then , when a radio is changed , call insert after it
[22:03:01] <heshanh> thanks guys
[22:03:07] <bufferxyz> yes I will type it up
[22:03:26] <bufferxyz> Dollz: oh I see
[22:03:28] <WebDragon> heshanh: or you could ssh into some other server and run irssi from there
[22:03:41] <new2net> some freaky syntax: $exampleImage->addEventHandler("click", "$(function() { $(\"#{$tabs->currentImage()->id()}\").dialog(\"close\"); return false; });");
[22:03:42] <bufferxyz> Dollz:  I will try it out :) Thanks!
[22:03:53] <Dollz> :)
[22:03:56] <WebDragon> and leave it in a screen session so you can always reattach to it later from anywhere else
[22:04:24] <Dollz> seancurtis: hey closures guy
[22:04:27] <seancurtis> bufferxyz: you can also add stuff into a node before it's inserted - eg: var foo = $('<div />'); foo.text('hello');
[22:04:40] <seancurtis> Dollz: that's not a working example :)
[22:04:52] <Dollz> seancurtis: yes , you will make it working :)
[22:05:18] <Dollz> seancurtis: it's not complete I know
[22:05:33] <Dollz> seancurtis: but imagine that it's a working one
[22:05:38] <seancurtis> no markup, I can't run it and generate an error, what's not working?
[22:06:07] <bufferxyz> seancurtis: oh I see
[22:06:11] <Dollz> seancurtis: the thing is , what ever function called from success method , is undefined
[22:06:12] <bufferxyz> seancurtis:  thanks :)
[22:06:34] <Dollz> seancurtis: hold on , I will modify it again
[22:06:40] <Dollz> seancurtis: to make it a bit clearer
[22:08:46] <Dollz> seancurtis: see this http://jsfiddle.net/Me8fs/2/
[22:09:03] <Dollz> seancurtis: while I go for 5 minutes of killer smooking

[22:18:55] <liquidcms> oops.. wrong window.. nvm
[22:19:02] <coldhead> lol
[22:19:03] <seancurtis> liquidcms: both are valid but the later is preferred
[22:19:21] <Dollz> seancurtis: hey , you should be on jsfiddle solving my problem
[22:19:36] <Dollz> seancurtis: instead of answering ppl questions that are not meant to be asked herer
[22:19:44] <Jakey> Dollz
[22:19:52] <Jakey> what izz your problemzz
[22:19:58] <Jakey> lol Dollz`
[22:20:06] <Dollz> Jakey: I'm a bit nuts
[22:20:08] * Jakey slaps Dollz
[22:20:25] <Jakey> no your frustrated
[22:20:37] <Dollz> Jakey: hmm , I prefer nuts
[22:21:23] <Jakey> wel...
[22:21:28] <Jakey> whats the dam probelmzz
[22:22:04] <Dollz> here is the damn problem ( without zz) http://jsfiddle.net/Me8fs/6/
[22:22:24] <Jakey> explain it
[22:22:41] <Dollz> Jakey: call back function is never called !
[22:22:56] <Jakey> -_-
[22:22:57] <Jakey> noob
[22:23:04] <Jakey> typical n00000bs
[22:23:08] <Dollz> lol
[22:23:09] <Jakey> try
[22:23:11] <Jakey> callback()
[22:23:23] <Jakey> dumasssssss
[22:23:23] <Dollz> Jakey: Ahaaaaa , I knew who is the noob now
[22:23:33] <Jakey> okay
[22:23:50] <Jakey> its not called by jquery you meant
[22:23:59] <Jakey> well it means its not sucess
[22:24:04] <ryanseddon> Dollz: 1) you're doing a cross domain call 2) you didnt close the string on the url property
[22:24:31] <Dollz> ryanseddon: when I use it on my website , I don't use x domain calls
[22:24:44] <Dollz> ryanseddon: I only call files on my server
[22:24:56] <ryanseddon> Dollz: cool then your issue is not closing the url strinfg
[22:24:58] <jasonmog> wtf. i have the validate plugin loaded but the function is not found for $, jQuery(), or $('form')
[22:25:00] <ryanseddon> string*
[22:25:01] <Dollz> ryanseddon: and i close strings properly ,, this is an illustration
[22:25:21] <Dollz> ryanseddon: that is not the porbelm either
[22:25:29] <Jakey> Dollz define a function for failure
[22:25:59] <seancurtis> Dollz: this works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/Me8fs/10/
[22:26:03] <Dollz> GUYS !! when I run codes inside success: function () { HERE } , it's run successfully , but when I call other functions , they are never called
[22:26:16] <Dollz> the problem is not in syntax
[22:26:19] <seancurtis> Dollz: all I did was fix up your JS syntax
[22:27:15] <Dollz> seancurtis: Oh , it's working !
[22:27:29] <Dollz> seancurtis: but it doesn't when I use deeper levels
[22:27:38] <seancurtis> cross domain xhr probably
[22:27:45] <Dollz> no way ,
[22:27:53] <Dollz> it's all on mywebsite
[22:27:59] * seancurtis shrugs*
[22:28:06] <Dollz> when I make outside calls , I use a php proxy
[22:28:45] <rosco_y> newbie problem, I'm working through "jQuery Fundamentals" and getting this error:  http://imagebin.org/172103,  why is "myObject undefined" on the line right after I was able to use it?
[22:29:32] <seancurtis> rosco_y: your second call is missing a capital O
[22:29:42] <seancurtis> myObject then myobject
[22:29:45] <seancurtis> JS is case sensitive
[22:29:48] <Dollz> seancurtis: thank you aw
[22:30:02] <rosco_y> Thanks seancurtis, I've done that a million times, I never learn.....
[22:30:08] <seancurtis> :) nps

[22:39:56] <Accelerator> Is there a jQuery code for automatically selecting and highlighting text in a readonly text field?
[22:40:09] <Jakey> yes
[22:42:35] <Accelerator> Any examples, in the documentation maybe?
[22:42:55] <Accelerator> I can't get Google to give me much. Maybe I should actually try and navigate the docs manually before asking
[22:43:39] <Jakey> try looking a selectors
[22:43:42] <Jakey> in the docs Accelerator
[22:44:09] <seancurtis> Accelerator: what're you trying to do?
[22:45:21] <Accelerator> seancurtis: I have a link to a file in a readonly text field. I want users to be able to click the field, and it automatically select and copy it to the users clipboard, then display a notification through another jQuery script I have.
[22:46:04] <ryanseddon> Accelerator: just do $("textarea")[0].select()
[22:46:06] <Accelerator> http://javascript-array.com/scripts/onclick_select_all_text_in_field/ Something like this selects the text, but doesn't copy it to the clipboard.
[22:49:06] <Accelerator> http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/clipboard-copy Got it.
[22:54:42] <rosco_y> what does the "call" function do?  http://paste2.org/p/1645232
[22:55:06] <seancurtis> executes the function in the current scope
[22:55:16] <seancurtis> I think :)
[22:55:21] <seancurtis> ? call
[22:55:22] <bot-t> seancurtis, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:55:28] <seancurtis> ? call()
[22:55:29] <bot-t> seancurtis, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:55:35] <seancurtis> hrm
[22:55:47] <rosco_y> thanks seancurtis, is it the case that all functions have a call() method?
[22:56:06] <seancurtis> rosco_y: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[22:56:20] <rosco_y> seancurtis: Thank you--that's what I was looking for :)
