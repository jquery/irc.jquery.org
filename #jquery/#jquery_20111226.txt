[00:19:29] <peterschmidler> good morning
[00:20:46] <peterschmidler> I'm doing this on click, but i want it to happen only once. Any best practice? $('<div>').attr('class', 'break').appendTo('body');
[00:21:16] <Zogot> can use either once
[00:21:24] <Zogot> or remove the class that initiates the click :p
[00:21:49] <Zogot> sorry, one.
[00:21:52] <Zogot> ?one
[00:21:52] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[00:26:29] <peterschmidler> Zogot: Thanks, but how would I appent .one() to this? $('<div>').attr('class', 'break').appendTo('body');
[00:27:05] <Zogot> In place of the click that you are using to run that
[00:27:20] <peterschmidler> Zogot: Ahh one() is for functions?
[00:27:23] <Zogot> So instead of $('.class').click(function(){//that line})
[00:27:37] <Zogot> Its $('.class').one('click', function(){// that line})
[00:28:09] <peterschmidler> Zogot: Yes, unfortunately there is other stuff in that function, that should be executed every time.
[00:31:32] <Zogot> I'm not sure this is the best way though
[00:31:38] <Zogot> but then attach 2 listeners
[00:31:48] <Zogot> 1 .click(function(){}) for all your stuff that runs all the time
[00:32:02] <Zogot> and anotehr .one('click', function(){}) that runs the line you want only once
[00:32:50] <Zogot> peterschmidler: like so http://jsfiddle.net/dFktL/3/
[00:33:46] <peterschmidler> Zogot: allright thanks
[00:36:48] <woozly> guys, how to make 3 state button? I have one sprite with 3 button positions. But can't understand logic, how to make it work properly.
[00:37:10] <Zogot> Thats css though
[00:38:01] <woozly> but
[00:38:05] <Zogot> If you host your image somewhere, I can show you
[00:38:20] <woozly> 3 state? Default + Hovered + Clicked
[00:38:28] <Zogot> Yeh
[00:38:35] <Zogot> :hover, :active and normal
[00:38:36] <woozly> okay wait please
[00:38:38] <woozly> oh..
[01:09:10] <woozly> just a question: I making 'hover' handler and put some new div with absolute position, on hovered Item (I try to make hover-remove button)
[01:09:33] <woozly> but when it appear, and if I put cursor on it - handler skipped :( and item dissapear
[02:44:10] <globe_tmp> hi guys is it possible tu use jquery to to set all the column of a datbale to a fix width
[02:51:13] <pulse00> globe_tmp: my guess $('#myTable td').width(somewidth);
[02:51:45] <globe_tmp> pulse00: i want to assign a width a specific column
[02:52:34] <pulse00> i'm trying to load a github gist in a div which is loaded via ajax. it's basically the same like this here: http://jsfiddle.net/BrWBu/. when the script tag is not loaded via ajax, everything works fine. as soon as the script tag is loaded via ajax, the gist is not injected into the dom. anyone an idea?
[02:52:59] <pulse00> globe_tmp: $('#myTable td.mySpecificColumn').width(somewidth);
[02:54:41] <ravenzz> pulse00 why are you sending that code to /echo/html/ ?
[02:54:56] <pulse00> because i'm trying to emulate an ajax request
[02:54:58] <globe_tmp> pulse00: thanks
[02:55:10] <ravenzz> can't you sent only the gist url?
[02:55:51] <ravenzz> send*
[02:55:57] <pulse00> ravenzz: the gist is injected via javascript: https://gist.github.com/1062569.js?_=1324895811069
[02:56:53] <ravenzz> uhm so you want to send the code that this script generate
[02:56:59] <ravenzz> to /echo/html/ ?
[02:58:11] <pulse00> ravenzz: i don't know how to properly show in the jsfiddle what's happening on my page. i assumed that using /echo/html would emulate an ajax request that loads some html. that's exactly what's happening in my page. i'm using ui-tabs, where each tab is loaded via ajax. one of the tabs includes this html: https://gist.github.com/1520929
[02:58:38] <pulse00> so nothing fancy at all. simply loading the code from the above gist via ajax, not during the initial request
[03:01:48] <ravenzz> you should use getScript, anyway it won't work because of the cross domain policy restrictions
[03:04:15] <ravenzz> pulse00 you could pass the git url to the /echo/html/[index.php]
[03:04:20] <ravenzz> ? file
[03:04:21] <bot-t> :file: Selects all elements of type file. http://api.jquery.com/file-selector/
[03:05:50] <pulse00> ravenzz: i think i'll simply use the generated html to show the gist, thanks
[03:07:16] <ravenzz> k

[04:58:44] <Zogot> Ah, well its ajaxError :P If I understood your correctly
[04:59:26] <Besogon> ?quit
[05:11:52] <gabriel9> I have AJAX request and all is OK, but when i get response i need to split it in more parts and append it to differnet divs. But i can't use find() to elements in response

[05:15:22] <gabriel9> if anyone knows ping me, i will be here
[05:24:34] <Logikos> I'm new to javascript and i'm trying to get something to work, where i have several quantity spinners in a form to allow single click ++ or -- of the values ... but i'm not sure how to get jquery to asoicate the spinner arrows with the relative input box: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/
[05:26:36] <sp_> hi guys
[05:28:42] <krz> what can i use to convert something like "2011-12-26 13:25:33" to "4 minutes ago"
[05:35:48] <sp_> krz: transform both dates (then and now) to seconds
[05:35:51] <sp_> substract
[05:35:56] <sp_> and transform back to minutes
[05:36:46] <krz> sp_: and will this also show as "2 hours ago" if it was 2 hours ago?
[05:37:06] <sp_> krz: what lang are you using?
[05:37:17] <krz> ruby?
[05:37:47] <krz> http://timeago.yarp.com/ looks like what i need. but is there a way to do this without a plugin?
[05:38:35] <Logikos> I'm new to javascript and i'm trying to get something to work, where i have several quantity spinners in a form to allow single click ++ or -- of the values ... but i'm not sure how to get jquery to asoicate the spinner arrows with the relative input box: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/
[05:38:50] <sp_> I think you should code it yourself krz
[05:38:56] <sp_> it shouldn't take more than 10 lines I think
[05:40:17] <fotoflo> Logikos:  start by making it work with one spinner
[05:40:45] <fotoflo> Logikos: have you checked out the jqueryUI spinners btw?
[05:41:05] <Logikos> fotoflo with one spinner is easy because the input id will be constant .. to have multipal spinners the id isnt constant
[05:41:36] <Logikos> so i dont know how to tell javascript to asoicate the click of the arrows with its asociated input box
[05:41:42] <fotoflo> this
[05:41:48] <fotoflo> use $(this)
[05:41:57] <Logikos> only idea i came up with bu thavent tryed yet is to put the inputbox id as the div's title
[05:42:10] <Logikos> the arrows are just divboxes
[05:42:19] <Logikos> so 'this' wouldnt refer to the inputbox
[05:42:39] <fotoflo> this.parent:nth-child(x) ?
[05:42:49] <Logikos> yes i have looked at jquery's ui spinners ... but thats alot of .js to load just for a lil spinner box
[05:43:25] <Logikos> hmm, that could work ... the parrent would only have one child as an input tag
[05:43:37] <Logikos> i'm very new to javascript so please forgive me
[05:43:51] <fotoflo> no problem
[05:44:12] <Logikos> rather than :nth-child ... can you seach the parents childern by tag name?
[05:44:19] <fotoflo> of course
[05:44:25] <Logikos> how might i do that
[05:44:36] <Logikos> because there will only ever be 1 input tag of the parrent
[05:45:01] <fotoflo> you know how to use the console btw?
[05:45:13] <Logikos> actualy i'd need the parents parent's childern .. because the arrows are childern of a div which is a sibling of the input tag
[05:45:35] <Logikos> no?
[05:45:41] <Logikos> i'm glad to learn though
[05:46:09] <fotoflo> first learn how to use the javascript console. its really helpful when figuring out selectors, regex, etc
[05:46:11] <Logikos> i've coded php etc for a long time but i've always avoided useing javascript untill very recently
[05:46:25] <fotoflo> what browser are you using?
[05:46:35] <Logikos> presently firefox, but i have them all
[05:46:39] <Logikos> chrome, opera etc
[05:46:54] <Logikos> i have firebug
[05:47:16] <fotoflo> i actually prefer chrome's console, so if you don't mind i'll tell you how to  use that
[05:47:26] <Logikos> that'll be fine
[05:47:30] <fotoflo> right click on an element and select "inspect element"
[05:47:36] <fotoflo> and then click console
[05:48:51] <Logikos> ok
[05:49:12] <Logikos> i rclicked one of the up arrows, went to inspect element > console
[05:49:17] <Logikos> now it seems i have a prompt
[05:49:34] <fotoflo> right
[05:49:55] <fotoflo> so if you are trying to find an item, you can do something like $("#ID")
[05:50:57] <fotoflo> or $(".class")
[05:51:00] <fotoflo> for example
[05:51:23] <Logikos> if i just enter that at the prompt it says syntax error ..
[05:51:32] <Logikos> i assume because i'm not telling it what to do with it
[05:51:34] <fotoflo> of course
[05:51:39] <fotoflo> no
[05:51:41] <fotoflo> you don't have any classes
[05:51:52] <fotoflo> sorryu
[05:51:58] <fotoflo> syntax error? it should say null
[05:52:11] <Logikos> well i typed in $(#qty2)
[05:52:27] <Logikos> this is the page im in: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/
[05:52:31] <Logikos> i do have a #qty2
[05:52:37] <Logikos> oh i need '' 's
[05:52:41] <fotoflo> yeah
[05:52:51] <Logikos> k, null
[05:52:56] <fotoflo> im having trouble using the console in jsfiddle
[05:53:57] <fotoflo> I'm not sure why
[05:54:11] <fotoflo> give it a shot in a real envirenment
[05:54:14] <Logikos> if i type this and hit enter it says DOMWindow
[05:54:32] <Logikos> so obviously the consel is not operating from the perspective of the element i right clicked to inspect
[05:54:33] <fotoflo> that's the global this
[05:54:38] <fotoflo> no
[05:54:43] <fotoflo> the console is glbaol
[05:54:49] <fotoflo> global
[05:55:06] <fotoflo> try typing $("#qty1") in your real env (not jsfiddle)
[05:55:44] <Logikos> this page doesnt exist in a real enviroment yet, but i'll create one for it, sec
[05:56:37] <fotoflo> i am guessing jsfiddle abstracts all the classes and id's
[05:56:44] <fotoflo> or rather sandboxes them
[06:02:09] <Logikos> ok fotoflo: http://bg.jerrybeaver.com/test/
[06:04:08] <fotoflo> http://screencast.com/t/sv6hUtBvsWf
[06:06:08] <fotoflo> so you can bind a function to the onClick event and then use $(this) to get the caller element
[06:06:12] <fotoflo> and traverse from there
[06:06:47] <fotoflo> i would put ID's on all your elements so you can see where you are too
[06:07:37] <Logikos> the number of spinners will vary
[06:09:15] <Logikos> $('#cart .cartqty:nth-child(2)')
[06:09:25] <Logikos> i typed that in but it gave me multipal things back
[06:09:34] <Logikos> when it should have only given 1?
[06:09:37] <Logikos> did i do it wrong
[06:10:15] <Logikos> i'm trying to identify just one of the up buttons so that i can figure out how to navigate backwords to get its asoicateing inputbox
[06:11:20] <Logikos> which would be an input tag existing as a sibling of the parent of the element clicked
[06:11:29] <Logikos> this.parrent.what?
[06:13:33] <fotoflo> sorry, clicked a way for a bit
[06:14:02] <fotoflo> if you are just trying to find something, put an id on it and $("#myID") will return it
[06:14:26] <fotoflo> $(".class") will return an array of everything that maches
[06:14:30] <fotoflo> matches
[06:18:33] <Logikos> yes i understand that, however in this application there will be a varable number of spinners, and they cant have the same id
[06:18:46] <Logikos> so  i need to do this.parrent.something
[06:18:49] <Logikos> to navigate to it
[06:20:06] <fotoflo> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[06:20:40] <fotoflo> you can do something like this: $(this).parent().next()
[06:21:44] <fotoflo> http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/8/
[06:21:59] <fotoflo> you want to do this
[06:22:07] <fotoflo> ;-)
[06:22:12] <fotoflo> (i think)
[06:22:40] <jmonreal> Hi all
[06:22:55] <jmonreal> Im working with the autocomplete of jquery-ui
[06:23:09] <jmonreal> I need to make a change on some action
[06:23:27] <jmonreal> when the key ENTER is pressed I need it to act like TAB
[06:23:29] <fotoflo> Logikos: then even if you generate the IDs on the fly you can get the ID's back and work with them
[06:23:35] <jmonreal> how can I do that?
[06:25:14] <Logikos> fotoflo in that example you are geting the id of the element clicked, it needs the id of the input element
[06:25:28] <Logikos> the parents sibling which is an input box
[06:25:42] <Logikos> of the parents parent 's first child
[06:25:50] <Logikos> or ... some other way to refer to it?
[06:32:11] <fotoflo> http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/11/
[06:34:36] <fotoflo> its really painful to do this in jsfiddle. if you use the console and play with those selectors on http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/  you will learn how to traverse
[06:35:32] <fotoflo> jmontreal: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[06:38:46] <Arun_> is there any jQuery function or object to check CSS3 properties such as transform ?
[06:42:57] <dabear> Arun_: yes
[06:43:18] <dabear> Arun_: <div class="showbox" style="border-color: red; -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg); -moz-transform: rotate(30deg); -o-transform: rotate(30deg);">box 2</div>
[06:43:54] <dabear> then $("div.showbox").css("WebkitTransform") will give you the value in a webkit browser
[06:44:11] <fotoflo> Logikos: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/17/
[06:44:32] <Logikos> fotoflo ty for your help, this apears to be working then: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/16/ ... unless you have sugestions as to how to improve it?
[06:45:26] <dabear> Logikos: there is a lot of code repetition there..
[06:45:28] <fotoflo>  http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/17/   Implemented with jQuery instead of straight javascript
[06:46:01] <fotoflo> mine is even uglier though ;-P
[06:46:18] <Logikos> dabear: please advise, i'd like to learn best methods
[06:49:58] <Arun_> hi, if there is any plugin called "Point", then what does "mousemove.Point" refer to ?
[06:50:58] <Arun_> what does "mousemove.Point" refer to in a plugin called "Point" ?
[06:59:20] <Arun_> what does "mousemove.Point" refer to in a plugin called "Point" ?
[07:00:00] <Arun_> can anyone here help me with this question : what does "mousemove.Point" refer to in a plugin called "Point" ?
[07:02:03] <Eviltwin> Are you talking about binding to an event?
[07:02:04] <dabear> Logikos: you can start by avoiding code duplication in the qtychange function, see http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/24/
[07:02:08] <Arun_> yeah
[07:02:18] <Eviltwin> That means the namespace "Point"
[07:02:26] <Eviltwin> http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events
[07:02:35] <Arun_> k thnx
[07:05:14] <dabear> Logikos: then you can combine the two selectors: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/26/
[07:08:21] <iman> I am using jquery and jsp together, I use .load() function to load a page in a div tag like  $("#accordion").load("pages/sth.jsp"); , as far as add a waiting symbol, how can I found that page load complete or not to remove ajax waiting symbol
[07:08:23] <iman> ?
[07:10:24] <dabear> Logikos: you can make it simpler too: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/27/
[07:17:40] <dabear> Logikos: So I would end up with something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/30/
[07:19:22] <dabear> Logikos: ofcourse now you would want to verify that the value is indeed numeric, and that $input has a length of just 1
[07:19:49] <dabear> ( = no other inputs)
[07:29:06] <dabear> Logikos: so this is what I end up with considering those factors as well: http://jsfiddle.net/TvUG2/32/
[07:29:27] <dabear> and please note that many browsers support <input type="number"> now
[07:29:42] <dabear> meaning your code would not be needed in those cases
[07:32:06] <koskoz> hi, I don't know why I don't enter in my submit event when I click on the submit button in my second form: http://jsfiddle.net/RND87/
[07:37:02] <dabear> koskoz: ugh, how am I gonna even bother looking at that fiddle ?
[07:37:39] <dabear> clean it up, remove the rubyparts, and show exactly what is needed for you problem
[07:40:14] <koskoz> dabear: firstly that's not ruby, secondly consider it just has a simple label
[07:40:43] <dabear> thirdly; make it understandable for us (me) to be able to help you
[07:41:13] <dabear> whether or not the code around is ruby is really not something I care about :)

[07:44:36] <Ortund> I'm identifying hyperlinks that trigger my .click events as sh1, sh2, sh3, etc. These links are to show/hide rows in a table that are identified as tr1, tr2, tr3, etc. How can I extract just the number from the clicked element?
[07:45:53] <koskoz> well, it works on jsfiddle but not on local...
[07:46:40] <Ortund> so essentially if I click on the <a id="sh2" class="showhide" href="#">+</a> tag, I need it to do $target = $("#tr" + left($(this).id, 3));
[07:49:24] <Ortund> fuck it, my idea won't work
[07:51:31] <dabear> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/JEncP/
[08:01:56] <Ortund> dabear: here's my html (nested by Chrome, generated by php) >> http://jsfiddle.net/uMy8R/
[08:03:11] <dabear> Ortund: yeah and ?
[08:03:15] <Ortund> the question now becomes how do I jquery this show/hide to target the correct row/s
[08:03:46] <imgrey> good evening #jquery
[08:04:01] <Ortund> idea...
[08:04:04] <imgrey> could somebody plz remind me how to find() all 'td's except the last one ?
[08:04:06] <dabear> Ortund: break it up in to pieces
[08:04:19] <dabear> first select all trs and save them in a variable $trs
[08:04:53] <dabear> then use .filter("#1") to select only the tr with id="1" for example
[08:05:46] <dabear> then hide all $trs, but shoud the filteret element
[08:05:51] <Ortund> dabear: I've had php generate the rows with the hyperlink's id, then "tr" then the row id, so ... "1tr5"
[08:06:06] <Ortund> now I just need to have jquery target each tr tag where it's id starts with 1
[08:06:18] <Ortund> well, with the id of $(this)
[08:07:12] <dabear> Ortund: you shouldn't do that, find another solution. although it is possible with *[id^=1] it will be a VERY slow selector
[08:07:43] <dabear> imgrey: curious, why would you need to do that?
[08:08:26] <Ortund> dabear, there aren't going to be millions of things for it to find, 10 max
[08:09:09] <dabear> Ortund: still slow
[08:09:26] <Ortund> slow being what? 500ms?
[08:09:37] <Ortund> what would you suggest?
[08:09:58] <dabear> Ortund: given the instructions I have given you, you should be able to code that your self now. please don't expect someone to come up with the solution to your entire problem for you
[08:10:12] <Ortund> wtf this again?
[08:10:23] <Ortund> I asked what you suggest I do, not to write the code for me
[08:10:24] <Ortund> jesus
[08:10:38] <dabear> I have give you all my suggestions
[08:10:48] <dabear> and some code examples
[08:10:52] <Ortund> "find another solution" fucking stellar suggestion
[08:12:03] <Ortund> btw "some code examples" ...  1 != some
[08:12:34] <]Darker[> hi ho
[08:12:34] <]Darker[> :D
[08:12:37] <dabear> I have given you a jsfiddle link showing you how to get the numeric part of an id of an anhor, and you have been given instructions and a selector, you should be able to combine them
[08:12:52] <Ortund> but you said it's slow
[08:13:01] <Ortund> so why give me the shit and tell me not to use it
[08:13:32] <dabear> imgrey: you can use .slice(0, -1)
[08:13:54] <]Darker[> hello guys -> http://jsfiddle.net/4Q2sh/17/
[08:14:19] <]Darker[> do you know how can I identify the two variables that are out of scope?
[08:15:40] <imgrey> dabear, thanks
[08:16:11] <dabear> Ortund: there is no other way than doing it slow if you need to do a partial match based on an id. you should find another solution serverside so that you don't have to run a slow selector. for example on the anchor have an attribute data-related-tr="ID-of-that-tr" and then use that to get the tr
[08:16:31] <Ortund> ]Darker[, dabear might know, but he'll tell you how and then he'll tell you not to do it that way
[08:16:35] <dabear> and thanks for being grateful for providing you with the info you need
[08:17:17] <dabear> Ortund: see my clarification above
[08:18:36] <dabear> ]Darker[: not quite sure if I understand you correctly. which variables or what exactly is your problem there? :)
[08:18:49] <]Darker[> dabear, u r right
[08:18:50] <]Darker[> :)
[08:18:54] <]Darker[> bad explatation
[08:19:12] <]Darker[> basically I am trying to do an operation inside the "animate()" function
[08:19:27] <]Darker[> the problem is that my code lose the value of "current" and "start" variables
[08:20:05] <]Darker[> and for every step of the "each" function
[08:20:24] <]Darker[> in that piece of code, current and start have always the same value
[08:20:51] <]Darker[> I though it's caused by the fact that the scope of those variable is different
[08:22:17] <kkuno> hi
[08:22:41] <kkuno> I'm trying to remove an element passing the function to another function:
[08:23:08] <kkuno> like:    function(next){next.apply}                 function(element.remove()}
[08:23:19] <kkuno> sorry
[08:23:24] <kkuno> like:    function(next){next.apply}                 function(element.remove}
[08:23:47] <dabear> ]Darker[: two solutions. 1) attach current and start values directly to each element with .data("start", "val") etc
[08:23:53] <kkuno> but it doesn't work
[08:23:57] <kkuno> someone has suggestions?
[08:24:13] <]Darker[> ah ha
[08:25:33] <dabear> ]Darker[: or 2) create a scope for each iteration. e.g. each element has its own current and start values. that part is harder to show here ,but would involve an immediately invoked function expression
[08:26:14] <]Darker[> uhm
[08:26:27] <]Darker[> sorry, probabibly I missunderstood
[08:26:42] <]Darker[> but I'm not losing the value inside the iteration
[08:26:48] <]Darker[> I am losing it inside the animate
[08:27:01] <]Darker[> how those solution can solve the problem inside that part?
[08:28:10] <dabear> ]Darker[: would be easier to help if you reduced your code example. see ?reduce
[08:29:40] <dabear> the scope isn't lost afaik
[08:29:53] <]Darker[> ah
[08:30:05] <]Darker[> so, why current and start are lost in the animate() ? :(
[08:31:36] <dabear> lost how? the variables are defined before the each loop
[08:31:50] <]Darker[> uh, i change the code
[08:31:54] <]Darker[> so u can see what I mean :)
[08:33:11] <dabear> I think this would solve your problem if I understand correctly: ( function(start,current){   $(elements[current]).animate....     })(start,current)
[08:33:54] <]Darker[> http://jsfiddle.net/4Q2sh/18/
[08:34:08] <]Darker[> if you click on one of the red box on the right
[08:34:18] <dabear> that code preserves the values of the start and current variables before the animation occurs, and gives you access to those values in the end of the animation
[08:34:29] <]Darker[> you can see that current value is always the same
[08:34:34] <]Darker[> ah
[08:34:35] <]Darker[> cool
[08:34:39] <]Darker[> I try :D
[08:35:45] <dabear> the point is that you have multiple animations occuring at the same time, and all those update or use the values of current and start, so you have a so called race-condition
[08:36:03] <dabear> jsfiddle seems to be slow today :(
[08:36:29] <]Darker[> it works :'
[08:36:58] <]Darker[> thank you very much
[08:37:17] <]Darker[> there are 2 days that are banging my head around
[08:37:48] <dabear> now, did you actually see that you have a race-condition? :)
[08:38:48] <]Darker[> eh, no :\
[08:38:55] <Ortund> how can I loop through the rows in my table? I know about .each, but I don't understand how it works
[08:38:55] <]Darker[> that's the problem
[08:39:39] <]Darker[> dabear: but it seems that something is still not ok
[08:39:49] <]Darker[> http://jsfiddle.net/4Q2sh/19/
[08:39:55] <]Darker[> the value are all right
[08:40:04] <]Darker[> but the swap

[08:53:18] <dabear> kkuno: no, try rephrashing your question
[08:54:10] <dabear> function calls need parens
[08:54:41] <dabear> so next.apply(this) if you wanna preserve the current this and pass it on to the next function
[08:54:41] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/uMy8R/1/            <<< no errors, but apparently does nothing, is .text the right attribute to be checking?

[08:55:54] <kkuno> it works usually
[08:56:09] <dabear> kkuno: jsfiddle your problem

[09:05:11] <dabear> kkuno: http://jsfiddle.net/2X7v3/6/

[09:46:02] <surfdue> Hello everyone :)
[09:46:46] <polygon-pusher> trying to use .html("string") to wrap an image with a div  but when I use  $(this).html('<div id=\"fullscale'+i+'\">'+$(this)+"</div>");  the new div gets nested in the img and does not wrap as its parent
[09:46:59] <surfdue> Ok, so I been searching for javascript dynamic variables, cant seem to find an answer. How can I make a variable called notice-1 (1 = fileID). Ex. var 'notice-' + fileID = 'test'; (dosnt work)
[09:47:19] <Rembane> surfdue: Put it in an array or an object?
[09:47:57] <surfdue> Rembane: i dont expect more to be made, but incase they are I just want to have my bases covered. I can't really initated the array/object before this though thats why im trying to just make it a variable
[09:48:11] <Guest41555> need some help with a jquery function, when I try to call the function  to display a message nothing happens. I have followed http://stuntsnippets.com/jquery-message-box/ can someone assist ?
[09:48:16] <Octane> can anyone think of a site that has implemented drag and drop (using jquery) onto svg or canvas elements?
[09:48:21] <surfdue> Rembane: I guess I could check to see if the object is already an object
[09:48:51] <Rembane> surfdue: Yeah, try that.
[09:49:38] <surfdue> Rembane: will this work? if(object !instanceof Object) var object = {};
[09:49:48] <surfdue> i know instanceof works, just not if I can put a ! before
[09:50:22] <Rembane> surfdue: I dunno, I'd done it like this: if(object == undefined) { var object = {} }
[09:50:43] <surfdue> i dont think that will work properly if the object has never been defined :O
[09:52:24] <surfdue> Rembane: hmm I have been doing instanceof and typeof all along.. because in variables if they are not defined I thought I had to do typeof variable != undefined
[09:53:35] <Rembane> surfdue: All variables get the value undefined if they haven't got a proper value.
[09:54:19] <Rembane> surfdue: http://saladwithsteve.com/2008/02/javascript-undefined-vs-null.html
[09:54:26] <surfdue> Rembane: i guess I never though of comparing it just to == undefined, I guess i originally was trying == false or == 'undefined
[09:54:38] <surfdue> :P thus why I googled it and found type of, but thanks for telling me that
[09:55:15] <surfdue> Rembane: I have question for you then however, all in all Im really just trying to have a custom close button insde of a pnotify notice ( http://pinesframework.org/pnotify/ )
[09:55:46] <surfdue> seems like there is a better way to do this then make a a tag inside the notice and watch for clicks on a live function
[09:55:57] <surfdue> or ... should be
[09:57:34] <surfdue> I cant seem to find this availabilty anywhere on their site, documentation, or google. I guess I could customize their jquery to make it listen for a close button :P
[09:58:12] <Rembane> surfdue: Hm... yes... but that seems like a lot of work
[09:58:39] <surfdue> Rembane: am I missing something or did they forget to make this a function? -.-
[09:58:54] <surfdue> There should be the ability to add a link/button/etc with a .close to make it close :/
[10:00:31] <surfdue> Actually they have a pnotify_remove function on the returned object, however I don't think there is a way for me to utilize that from within the notify :/
[10:00:45] <Rembane> surfdue: Oh. :/
[10:00:46] <Rembane> Hm...
[10:02:00] * surfdue thinks of a fork
[10:02:01] <surfdue> lol..
[10:02:11] <Rembane> ^^
[10:02:33] <surfdue> why do I have to pick the worst plugins then have it completely implamented to find out its missing basic functionality
[10:02:45] * surfdue thinks of making a jquery guide with the top rated plugins per use :/
[10:03:58] <Rembane> surfdue: Do it!
[10:09:46] <polygon-pusher> trying to remove the width and height of an image via $img.css({width:'', height:''});  but no luck.... that used to work just fine and I know I'm selecting the img cause I can set its value to say 100 and it will scale it. is there a better way to remove a value from rule?
[10:10:49] <polygon-pusher> maybe that changed with 1.7.1?
[10:12:22] <polygon-pusher> is this place dead today?

[12:55:48] <quizme> merry christmas
[12:56:32] <quizme> what does jquery have the parseJSON function, when there is already the JSON.parse function in javascript?  to support browsers that don't have JSON.parse ?
[12:56:41] <systemfault> Exactly.
[12:56:48] <systemfault> Like older IEs
[12:56:55] <quizme> i see thank you so much
[13:04:17] <muhoo> what? hmm, if chosen doesn't do IE7, does it degrade to regular select?
[13:04:26] <systemfault> Yes
[13:04:31] <systemfault> That's exactly what it does.
[13:04:32] <muhoo> i37 is an abomination before the lord
[13:04:43] <muhoo> ie7 even
[13:04:50] <systemfault> I agree but I need to support it.
[13:04:59] <muhoo> good point. if it degrades i'm ok with that
[13:05:16] <muhoo> but i still don't know why it won't do numeric values. weird.
[13:05:58] <muhoo> is there any way to put up a jsfiddle for something like chosen? i can duplicate the bug very easily with their example code in their github

[13:15:59] <surfdue> when you delete an element the .live events arnt deleted with them?
[13:31:09] <surfdue> hmm I cant seem to figure this out.. My current code works fine but I am now on jq 1.7 $('.editor .files a.file').live('click', function() {}); I want to change it to ON but this appears to not function at all infact, it dosnt register the click $('.editor .files').on('click', 'a.file', function() {});
[13:33:45] <surfdue> oh i believe i fixed it, I guess you have to define the ON after they are loaded, kinda why i liked live, but it works now :)
[13:42:14] <surfdue> hmm so I guess I cant use on for some stuff, because it dosnt constantly check for new elements for example loaded with ajax :/

[14:53:37] <]Darker[> hi
[14:55:44] <quizme> i am loading hashes into memory using the web and localStorage.  So they load at different rates.  Generally stuff from the web is slower than localStorage, but you can imagine a sceanrio when the user's local CPU might be very busy, in which case the stuff from localStorage might load more slowly than the web.  How do you express the notion of "wait until this resource gets loaded" in Javascript?  I don't want to poll.  I guess i could
[14:55:44] <quizme>  register callbacks on the resource, then sequentially call them once it's ready?. what do you think?

[15:11:33] <manuell> wathek: order the functions ?
[15:11:46] <manuell> first f1 then f2
[15:12:15] <manuell> attach the handler in this order

[15:13:34] <wathek> manuell, I'd like that $('myelem').click(function { ...}); to be executed before the $(document).on("click", "myelem", function() { });
[15:13:42] <manuell> and on document).on(... you need the other function ?
[15:13:49] <manuell> oh
[15:13:50] <manuell> hmm
[15:14:21] <wathek> manuell, yes
[15:14:49] <wathek> manuell, cause you see the $('myelem').click sets a new attribute to my elem that's needed in $(document).on ....
[15:15:27] <manuell> okay, and when you click the new attribute, you need to execute the other funktion ?
[15:15:29] <manuell> function
[15:16:12] <wathek> manuell, yes the new attribute is added to myelem and is needed for $(document).on
[15:16:54] <manuell> you can try to proof ('yourElement).attr('yourNewAttr') is empty
[15:17:12] <manuell> and if so, execute your first function, and if not, execute the other
[15:17:13] <wathek> manuell, and ?

[16:10:17] <Mnkras-Laptop> example: http://jsfiddle.net/AqaDh/
[16:10:27] <Mnkras-Laptop> clicking on any of the tabs you will see,
[16:16:58] <Smaug_> thats because you have padding on .ui-accordion .ui-accordion-content div, either remove it OR if you want to have it indented there's couple of ways to do it, one of them is specifying the padding of accordion content and also width of the children (probably using percantage - ie 5% padding, 95% width)

[16:27:38] <kkuno> but it search only in the childrens
[16:27:49] <kkuno> and it skip the main obj
[16:28:00] <kkuno> is it possible to avoid this
[16:28:01] <kkuno> ?
[16:32:50] <fotoflo> is it possible to have an event listener that stays open for a long period of time calls back when the server sends a response? (useful, for example, in realtime chat)
[16:35:38] <Guest40743> hi
[16:36:13] <Guest40743> http://dpaste.com/678094/ how can i fire a link by using buttons with jquery-ui?
[16:37:05] <kkuno> ok solved:    $(obj).find('*').andSelf().filter(selector)
[16:37:06] <kkuno> -.-
[16:38:38] <jstonne> @Guest40743 Since you have the url in a "site" varaible, I suppose you could do document.location.href=site
[16:41:33] <Guest40743> @jstonne sounds good, thank u
[16:42:01] <jstonne> you're welcome.
[17:03:42] <Tyler__> this might be obvious but is there an easy way to calculate or figure out what what the top and left offsets should be to center a div within the current screen view if I know the width/height of the div?
[17:08:03] <jstonne> You can use $(document).width() / $(document).height() to get the width/height of the viewport. offsetLeft = (docWidth - divWidth) / 2; offsetTop = (docHeight - divHeight) / 2;
[17:08:47] <Tyler__> jstonne: thanks a bunch, I was just starting to work my way through that.
[17:10:26] <jstonne> Sorry I made a mistake. $(window).width() / $(window).height()
[17:10:45] <jstonne> returns the width/height of the viewable area.
[17:11:03] <]Darker[> hi guys
[17:11:09] <]Darker[> anyone is able to help me? I am tring to understand why the animate's callback is called before the animation ends
[17:11:12] <]Darker[> that's my example
[17:11:14] <]Darker[> http://jsfiddle.net/4Q2sh/22/
[17:11:19] <Tyler__> ok, thanks
[17:15:20] <jstonne> ]Darker[: which callback?
[17:15:28] <]Darker[> the problem is here $(elements[current]).delay(d).animate({ opacity: 0}, 1000, function (current, start) {
[17:15:37] <]Darker[> for istance
[17:15:43] <]Darker[> if you click on one of those red blocks
[17:15:56] <]Darker[> you can see that the content inside changes
[17:16:12] <]Darker[> but it changes before the end of the opacity: 0
[17:16:50] <]Darker[> i wrote the instruction "$(elements[current]).html($(oldElements[(current - 1)]).html());" in the callback function
[17:17:20] <]Darker[> in the way that this operation is done after the animated() one is completed
[17:17:41] <]Darker[> but, I dunno why, I'm not succeding in that :\
[17:19:22] <]Darker[> if I comment the Current, start in the callback function (and inside the function's return)
[17:19:30] <]Darker[> the transaction works properly
[17:19:41] <]Darker[> but, for the race condition, the data is wrong
[17:22:49] <Guest40743> http://dpaste.com/678100/ can anyone say me why the submit dont fire if i press OK?
[17:32:37] <jstonne> ]Darker[: When you're doing function(current,start){}(current,start), the function gets executed straightaway. When you comment out current/start, the value in "current" gets incremented before the animation ends.
[17:33:38] <jstonne> Umm, I think you'll need to assign the current/start value to another 2 extra variables (yuck i know)
[17:33:48] <jstonne> Hold on.
[17:33:52] <]Darker[> ok
[17:33:56] <]Darker[> tnx for your time

[17:36:06] <]Darker[> you are solved the race condition assigning the variables?
[17:37:32] <]Darker[> I understood
[17:37:35] <]Darker[> :|
[17:38:02] <jstonne> yeah, the callback needs to know the old current/start values. Perhaps you can rework on that.
[17:38:22] <]Darker[> ehhehe
[17:38:29] <]Darker[> thanks very much
[17:38:42] <jstonne> @Guest40743 Perhaps the action="" is missing the url? *wild guess*

[17:39:18] <destryalhmns> hey
[17:39:20] <jstonne> @Darker, you're welcome. :-)
[17:39:40] <destryalhmns> and sorry if i say something that anyone thinks i have mentioned before but was resolved...
[17:39:59] <destryalhmns> does anyone have any idea why the viewport tag wont work for me????
[17:40:13] <user> jstonne: thanks for that jsfiddle thingy
[17:40:45] <destryalhmns> like i follow the apple and android docs.... but cannot ge tthe viewport to work like they say it should
[17:41:04] <destryalhmns> and i have zero clue why, and i have spent like a total of two days of my life on this problem...
[17:42:42] <jstonne> chill dude, what are you trying to achieve with the viewport tag?
[17:44:01] <destryalhmns> i cant get it to do even the most basic stuff
[17:44:25] <destryalhmns> for example, what is the tag? allow the user to zoom?... i cant get that to work or initial scale to work or anything
[17:45:27] <destryalhmns> here is an example to help you understand. this is not what i am trying to do... i just made this to get like a sanity check https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3558031?start=0&tstart=0
[17:47:05] <surfdue> chosen is really nice and all but its not really built for dynamic data it dosnt appear
[17:47:07] <surfdue> aka getting request from ajax
[17:48:53] <jstonne> @surfdue Chosen looks really good.
[17:49:12] <surfdue> jstonne: ya but i dont see a way to make it load results through an ajax call unless i crazy modify it
[17:49:13] <surfdue> :/
[17:49:35] <surfdue> their change callback isnt even working for me except on the first call.. I need it to trigger a change on any typing :/
[17:53:14] <jstonne> @surfdue Yeah looks like its gonna take awhile to dig through their codes.
[18:00:45] <]Darker[> jstonne: do you know if there's a way to disable the "onclick" function when the function is already in progress?
[18:03:18] <kelly1212> hey guys
[18:03:47] <jstonne> I would suggest that you use a boolean flag to check, animating=true before the animation, and animating=false in the callback. The onclick event gets fired but checks for this flag first before doing anything. I would recommend this over binding/unbinding.
[18:04:12] <]Darker[> ah
[18:04:14] <]Darker[> really nice tip
[18:04:16] <]Darker[> thanks :)
[18:05:20] <Tyler__> is it better to do all your jquery in $(document).ready({}) instead of doing it just before the </body>
[18:08:19] <kelly1212> is there any reason why jquery slidedown wouldnt work with Rails?
[18:08:30] <kelly1212> or any situations that would prohibit it?
[18:13:36] <jstonne> @Tyler__ This is a good read. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1438883/jquery-why-use-document-ready-if-external-js-at-bottom-of-page
[18:14:19] <jstonne> @kelly1212 I don't see the relation between slideDown() and rails, unless you're doing something wrong.
[18:18:48] <kelly1212> i dont see the relation either
[18:19:10] <kelly1212> i have a test page that's working fine, but  when i copy and past the same code into my rails app it doesnt work
[18:19:26] <kelly1212> does the jquery function have to run at the bottom of the page?
[18:20:40] <jstonne> If your code is referencing to a DOM element upon execution, it's best to wrap it inside $(document).ready(function(){ // code here }); ... or at the bottom of the page... ;)
[18:23:07] <]Darker[> time to sleep, tnx again jstonne :)
[18:23:18] <jstonne> Nite darker.
[18:31:55] <pyther> Hello
[18:33:29] <pyther> I have a channels dropdown box and files dropdown box that I need to populate (using ajax).
[18:33:43] <pyther> {"files": [], "channels": [[1, "3 - WKYC"], [2, "2 - PBS"], [4, "8 - WJW"]], "type": "ivtv"} <= my json so far
[18:34:34] <pyther> for channels value=1, text=3 - WKYC; value=2, text=2 - PBS
[18:34:43] <pyther> is this possible, I'm I going about this the wrong way?
[18:38:45] <jstonne> @pyther your json looks fine. But code-wise, retrieving your channel data would be more semantic perhaps, if you could do.. "channels": [{ "number": 1, "name": "3 - WYKC"},{},{}]... so assuming in a scenario where you would do $.each(channels, function(i, channel){});  You could totally access the data via.... channel.number channel.name....    your way of doing it.. would be channel[0] and channel[1]...
[18:41:08] <jstonne> $('<option>').attr('value', channel.number).html(channel.text).appendTo('.YourSelectBoxHere');
[18:43:15] <pyther> jstonne: thanks, I'll give that a try, have to figure out how to parse/code the json
[18:44:18] <jstonne> If it's returned by $.ajax.. the JSON string will be automatically parsed if I am not wrong. If not you can do $.parseJSON(str);
[18:44:57] <pyther> err.. what I meant is I have to figure out how to render the proper json data in python
[18:53:54] <Entomo> Does anyone know a way to interrogate a jquery function callback argument to see what's populated?  I'm trying to figure out what, exactly, the UI object is that get's returned from the receive() event on http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#event-receive
[18:55:26] <jstonne> console.log(arguments);
[18:56:27] <Entomo> Thanks jstonne.  I'll give it a shot
[18:56:34] <jstonne> You're welcome.
[18:58:26] <Entomo> oh that's phenomenal jstonne.  Exactly what I needed.
[18:58:46] <jstonne> :)
[19:00:08] <Guest63480> hi, i open a dialog with jquery-ui...i want to access the input-elements in the dialog, if i call alert($('input:first').val()) it gives me the value from the mainsite where i open the dialog
[19:00:39] <Guest63480> how can i get the values from the form in my dialog?
[19:01:10] <jstonne> @Guest63480 You will need to be more specific than $('input:first'). Perhaps the dialog selector $('.myDialog input:first
[19:02:01] <Guest63480> ok thanks
[19:04:47] <Guest63480> i think i have to do something with $this or parent, canÂ´t access another input
[19:04:49] <Guest63480> http://dpaste.com/678114/
[19:04:54] <Guest63480> here is the code
[19:06:40] <jstonne> Can I see your html codes?
[19:06:46] <Guest63480> sure
[19:06:48] <Entomo> I think you need a better selector, Guest63480. Are you trying to pull the names and values for all the <input>s?
[19:07:00] <pyther> jstonne: thanks so much, got the code working
[19:07:53] <jstonne> @pyther: That's great. You're welcome.
[19:08:48] <Guest63480> http://dpaste.com/678116/
[19:09:58] <Guest63480> no i think the problem is not the selector, i think the dialog works like a own site and iÂ´m on the parent-site
[19:10:14] <jstonne> ah you're trying to access the iframe's content?
[19:10:51] <Guest63480> yes
[19:11:00] <Guest63480> :)
[19:12:47] <Guest63480> is there a solution? the problem costs me hours hours of work
[19:13:37] <jstonne> Alright, I do not know what $(this) returns. But if you were to add this... var iframe = $('<iframe src = "'+site+'">').dialog({...  the "var iframe = " part...    then inside the OK: function() {}... you can do iframe.find('#phone').val();
[19:14:10] <jstonne> Let me know if it works.
[19:14:25] <Guest63480> ok :) thank u
[19:15:44] <Guest63480> konsole says iframe is not defined
[19:15:49] <Guest63480> console
[19:16:42] <jstonne> what does console says about "this"... e.g. console.log(this);  is it referring to the iframe object?
[19:17:43] <Guest63480> yes, he got it
[19:20:41] <Guest63480> but when i try console.log($(this).find('#phone').val()); it returnts me undefined
[19:22:01] <jstonne> Try $(this.contentDocument).find('#phone').val()
[19:22:48] <Guest63480> i works:)
[19:22:57] <jstonne> Alright then. :-)
[19:22:59] <Guest63480> u save my night...thanks a lot
[19:23:32] <jstonne> Now you can sleep early hehe :(
[19:23:33] <jstonne> :)

[20:13:23] <surfdue> anyone know the best way to take these '/', '.', '-', '_', ' ' out of a string and replace them with '-'
[20:15:12] <dr0id> .replace()

[20:16:08] <surfdue> its not working properly i suck at reg.. lol
[20:17:26] <dr0id> smth like .replace(/[\s-_.\/]/g, '-')
[20:17:57] <surfdue> dr0id: ah yes actually I think this will do .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/ig, '-')

[20:35:25] <jrm2k6> i don't understand how callback function work : http://pastebin.com/phfxpLm5 for example in this, why return something doesn't work? I don't know where to find some explanation about that
[20:36:42] <krz> i have a list of <li>'s. how do i find the <li> element with the text 'foobar'?
[20:37:00] <krz> is there a way to do this without iterating over an .each loop?
[20:38:11] <Anime> $("li:contains('foobar')")
[20:44:17] <jrm2k6> http://pastebin.com/KcUSsVtS how should I use the return keyword in this case?

[23:08:23] <dexter_e> Would like to create an array of DIVS using a dataset and then run an ajax query for each DIV to update more data..  Is there an easy way to do this with jQ
[23:10:32] <jstonne> Wouldn't it be easier to make a single ajax query to retrieve data for all DIVs?
[23:15:04] <dexter_e> Well its heavily aggregated data for multiple seperate objects
[23:15:51] <dexter_e> basically the original list is a list of domains   and  the secondary request aggregates sales and traffic data
[23:16:41] <dexter_e> If I do that in one request for a list of 10 domains that would be like 21 database queries for one request
[23:17:01] <dexter_e> it would be nice to display the list first and then update the secondary bonus data in the list
[23:41:22] <dogarrhea2> so all my integer items in jquery data are appended with a 'i' character
[23:41:27] <dogarrhea2> why is it doing this? another bug?
