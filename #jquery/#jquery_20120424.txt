[00:00:50] <coldhead> cool
[00:01:38] <jrred> what i'm struggling with is how do I make c look up what is being returned by the function below it.
[00:01:49] <Brammm> I have a checkbox in a li in an ul. I fire an event when the checkbox is changed, but in the executed function, I need the parent ul. Is there a "best approach"? Do I use .closest('ul') or just parent().parent()?
[00:01:51] <jrred> pretty much all the tutorials refer to linking to a php file, which is confusing to me
[00:02:34] <jrred> also, i get the sense that the function below it is too heavily modified for HTML, and #inputname.autocomplete() will fail with it
[00:02:47] <coldhead> jrred: you mean you might have multiple such forms on the page?
[00:02:52] <coldhead> and you want to find the nearest?
[00:03:01] <jrred> oh no, nothing that complicated
[00:03:21] <jrred> i have one form, where you type a string and then it returns a list based on that string from which you can select
[00:03:33] <jrred> one input box, to be more specific
[00:03:34] <coldhead> right
[00:03:47] <coldhead> so the code you have to get the val from c looks right
[00:04:36] <Whirl3d> Brammm, use .closest
[00:04:37] <jrred> right, now ideally i'd transform that form into a drop-down menu, so you type in "coffee" and it returns a bunch of values matching "coffee"
[00:05:06] <swe_ET> jrred : build up a <select>
[00:05:13] <Brammm> thanks Whirl3d
[00:05:14] <coldhead> right on, swe_ET
[00:05:31] <coldhead> jrred: just emit <option>s rather than <li>s
[00:05:41] <Brammm> Further down the function, I want to test all checkboxes of the closest('ul'), just use .find('ul:checked') then?
[00:05:50] <jrred> note that this is like day .5 for me and javascript
[00:05:59] <coldhead> so far so good, jrred
[00:06:12] <jrred> so everything you're saying to me is chinese
[00:06:13] <coldhead> you might wanna indent better but that will come with practice, and lots of people bitching about it
[00:06:22] <jrred> okay
[00:06:50] <coldhead> jrred: http://jsfiddle.net/SNHpc/1/
[00:06:53] <jrred> though to be fair i think that's from the paste :)
[00:06:57] <Whirl3d> Brammm, close....that would give you all checked UL elements (which doesn't make sense). $(this).closest("ul").filter(":checked");
[00:07:10] <Whirl3d> sory
[00:07:14] <Whirl3d> find, not filter
[00:07:15] <Whirl3d> lol
[00:07:17] <coldhead> jrred: there's a Tidy button in jsfiddle that will make you look like a pro
[00:07:30] <Whirl3d> $(this).closest("ul").find(":checked");
[00:07:35] <jrred> look at that
[00:08:07] <jrred> what did <option> do?
[00:09:23] <Brammm> No no, Whirl3d , I mean like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hdFd4/
[00:10:51] <coldhead> jrred: option is how you do a drop down menu entry in HTML
[00:11:50] <jrred> so should i not use jquery's #input.autocomplete()
[00:11:58] <jrred> coldhead^
[00:12:06] <jrred> oops coldhead ^
[00:12:19] <Xotix> hi someone knows jscrollpane and can tell me how i make a gap at the end and beginning of the bar?
[00:13:20] <coldhead> jrred: i'm not sure if you should use it
[00:13:26] <coldhead> i've never tried it
[00:13:31] <coldhead> it looks like you're almost there on your own
[00:13:48] <jrred> :) is that a nice way of saying "figure it out"?
[00:14:20] <Whirl3d> so, were you asking a question, Brammm? Or did you get it all worked out?
[00:14:27] <swe_ET> jrred:  you need to wrap your <options> inside a <select>
[00:14:27] <coldhead> i would never be that nice, jrred
[00:14:44] <coldhead> jrred: what you have here seems most of the way towards what i think you want
[00:15:03] <jrred> i guess i don't understand how that would work swe_ET
[00:15:11] <coldhead> if you want to use autocomplete i think you'd be undoing this
[00:15:16] <coldhead> and redoing it with autocomplete
[00:15:23] <coldhead> but it may be that you want something else entirely
[00:15:32] <coldhead> i would like a donut
[00:15:36] <coldhead> if you're taking orders
[00:15:53] <jrred> where are you?
[00:16:26] <jrred> so should I wrap that entire function in a select?
[00:16:39] <Brammm> Whirl3d: I was just wondering what the best approach was to select the items, everything works, I was just wondering if I'm using the correct approach
[00:16:52] <coldhead> jrred: no no, the <select> replaces the <li> in your code
[00:16:57] <coldhead> you'r edoing the same thing
[00:16:59] <swe_ET> jrred: no the sting with <options>
[00:17:08] <swe_ET> string...
[00:17:10] <coldhead> but you're making an html drop down menu
[00:17:14] <coldhead> instead of an html list
[00:17:21] <Whirl3d> I believe so. You don't need to cache the wrapper every time in your change handler, though
[00:18:15] <jrred> okay so how should I modify the current input i've got to get the data that comes from that function? because right now that function just overrides a div in the html and returns it as html text
[00:18:33] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/hdFd4/7/
[00:19:09] <swe_ET> jrred: do you want to replace your input ? or just show a dropdown below?
[00:19:18] <jrred> replace it
[00:19:22] <jrred> ideally
[00:19:42] <Brammm> Whirl3d: won't that cause problems if I have multiple .LimitOptions lists?
[00:19:48] <swe_ET> jrred: .hide() ?
[00:20:14] <Whirl3d> Ah, yes. Then just do it all in one line...
[00:20:23] <Brammm> okay, thanks for the advice ^^
[00:20:33] <jrred> well i need the user to have a box where they type in the string
[00:20:45] <coldhead> jrred: did you look at the fiddle i saved for you? it has <option> instead of <li>
[00:20:48] <coldhead> it should work
[00:22:44] <jrred> coldhead, that's odd…i don't see how that would change the form
[00:23:47] <Whirl3d> Brammm, http://jsfiddle.net/hdFd4/9/
[00:24:11] <jrred> because that response as it stands only has a connection to a div which contains text to be replaced, it doesn't have any connection to the input that I can see
[00:25:20] <Whirl3d> But if you know that all of the elements have the same parent (which it sounds like yours don't) you could also use $(this).siblings(":checked");  but that only works if they are all on the same heirarchical level
[00:25:34] <swe_ET> jrred: coldhead's jsfiddle should work fine
[00:26:05] <coldhead> jrred: i replaced the <div> it's being saved to with a <select?
[00:26:09] <coldhead> <select>*
[00:26:32] <jrred> ooh okay
[00:26:32] <coldhead> and the input is being used to retrieve the value you send to the server
[00:26:46] <coldhead> if you want to hide it once the data come back use hide() as swe_ET suggested
[00:26:53] <jrred> i missed that, sorry
[00:27:17] <coldhead> no worries!
[00:27:25] <coldhead> we're going to get there
[00:27:47] <jrred> one thing though is that's not really the behavior i'd like :(
[00:27:49] <jrred> it's close
[00:28:26] <jrred> my preference would be for the original box to contain the drop down menu, not create a separate drop-down
[00:28:36] <coldhead> if you want it to behave more like jquery ui's autocomplete, you should probably use that
[00:28:55] <coldhead> you COULD move the dropdown over the input
[00:28:57] <coldhead> with CSS
[00:29:06] <jrred> haha hm
[00:29:09] <coldhead> and it would look pretty close
[00:29:29] <jrred> your capitals make it sound like i shouldn't
[00:30:23] <coldhead> its slightly hacky
[00:30:34] <jrred> sounds it
[00:30:41] <coldhead> it would be hard to do it as seemlessly as autocomplete()
[00:30:53] <jrred> then i might as well go with autocomplete()
[00:34:14] <verdoc> I'm finding myself defining the same $.ajax().fail() callback over and over, what's a good way to define it once instead of over and over?
[00:35:19] <Whirl3d> verdoc, define it and store it in a variable.
[00:35:35] <Cork> ?.ajaxError
[00:35:35] <bot-t> .ajaxError(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete with an error. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[00:36:38] <jrred> thanks for your help coldhead and swe_ET, i'm going to try jquery's autocomplete and hope i can figure it out
[00:37:51] <NodeX> can one pass a context into on() ?
[00:37:54] <NodeX> ?on
[00:37:54] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:38:01] <Whirl3d> so, anybody know how I could include the name of an initiailization function to be applied to a div by storing it in the div's markup?  In other workds <div id='test' data-init='initTest'>some stuff</div>
[00:38:04] <verdoc> Cork - what's the diff between .ajaxError, ajax({error: function() {}} and fail? I saw that jqXHR.error() is being deprecated
[00:41:53] <Slydder> morning all
[00:42:22] <Slydder> can anyone tell me how to access ressortsarray in the replaceWith area on line 5? I am slowly losing my mind here. thanks. http://paste.debian.net/164804/
[00:44:41] <philaneous> hey cutie
[00:47:07] <Whirl3d> Slydder, is your "ressortsarray supposed to be a function that gets evaluated more than once or is it a single time thing?
[00:47:20] <coldhead> jrred: come get whatever help you need, bunch of autocomplete() experts all up in this channel
[00:47:31] <Slydder> ressortsarray is a simple array.
[00:48:11] <Whirl3d> perhaps you have to parseInt($(this).val())
[00:49:47] <Slydder> na. all works as it should. I just can't get the array at line 5. at line 3 (jQuery.get) I use it to pull the refresh data from the server. using an alert I can see the return from the server. However, I need to get the ID name that is in the ressortsarray variable to get the replaceWith working.
[00:50:39] <Slydder> and I am still new to js so I am missing something in the area of variable scope here.
[00:50:44] <Whirl3d> err, wait. $(this).val inside your each is always going to be a 1 or 0, I think since $(this) is the :checked element?
[00:51:52] <Slydder> no. it's the value of the checkbox that is checked. that's why I check for ":checked"
[00:54:33] <Slydder> if I do a alert(ressortsarray(jQuery(this).val()); prior to the jQuery.get I can see each ID in the array
[00:55:41] <Slydder> sorry. should be ressortsarray[]
[00:57:18] <Xotix> does someone know how i can make a sce at the end and start of a jscrollPane scrollbar?
[00:59:19] <xec_> Slydder: i think the problem might be your use of 'this'
[00:59:46] <xec_> Slydder: try caching it in the .each() loop
[01:01:27] <xec_> Slydder: something like this is what i mean: http://paste.debian.net/164809/
[01:01:36] <xec_> dunno if that's really what the problem is, though
[01:02:29] <Slydder> xec: could work. let me look
[01:06:29] <Slydder> xec: perfect guy.
[01:07:37] <Christer> Any recommended timepickers?  im using it for adding timed intervals to workouts. 0:00->1:45 = Warmup 1:46->2:59 = Stage 1
[01:10:49] <pneftali> guys - how to clear forms in chrome ?
[01:11:23] <Cork> form.reset() =
[01:11:24] <Cork> *?
[01:11:32] <pneftali> i already loop through all the form input elements and log their values and it shows its empty. but the form still has values.
[01:11:39] <ProXy> http://www.electrictoolbox.com/jquery-clear-form/ ?
[01:11:48] <pneftali> yeah i already did that
[01:13:29] <MarvinFord> hi hello there, someone arround how can tell me why this is "undefined" ? http://jsfiddle.net/CutC7/
[01:14:32] <ProXy> @MarvinFord that is the right way:  alert(k.position().top);
[01:17:53] <xec_> MarvinFord: what ProXy said. you might also want to put your selectors inside a doc ready http://jsfiddle.net/CutC7/2/
[01:18:48] <xec_> (function(){})(); is a just function expression (will not wait till things are ready)
[01:18:51] <MarvinFord> yay, thanks.
[01:20:39] <koichirose> Hello, I'm looking for a very simple jQuery plugin that allows multiple file selection from an input AND image preview with the FileAPI (I don't care about browsers that don't support it). That's it. No upload, I'm going to manage that myself. Any hints?
[01:22:11] <Cork> koichirose: that sounds way to specific, and i doubt it exists
[01:23:06] <koichirose> I mean something like this: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ but without the upload part. Extracting what I need only requires too much time I suspect...
[01:24:59] <bjensen> Should a $(".foo").on() be wrapped in a document.ready {} ?
[01:25:25] <MarvinFord> @xec_: What if chrome tells me: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[01:25:25] <Cork> if you want it to run when the page is ready
[01:25:40] <xec_> MarvinFord: then you call the cops!
[01:25:50] <ProXy> @bjensen It's a good pracice anytime in jQuery
[01:25:51] <xec_> MarvinFord: or check your syntax
[01:26:07] <MarvinFord> @xec_: haha ^^, yeah checked ;)
[01:26:09] <bjensen> Cork: No, but its not triggering. My concrete problem is that this works: http://jsfiddle.net/ksNHJ/ but not on my page
[01:26:18] <Cork> MarvinFord: sounds like you have none valid characters in your page
[01:26:49] <ProXy> or unclosed bracket
[01:27:19] <Cork> thats normaly not illegal tocken
[01:27:25] <Cork> *token
[01:27:27] <xec_> bjensen: $('.foo') won't work until the element(s) with class "foo" is in the DOM, which means you need doc ready, or include your <script> later (read bottom) on the page
[01:27:50] <bjensen> xec: yeah Ill use the script in the bottom..isnt that also better performance wise?
[01:28:10] <xec_> bjensen: yes, but not really a noticable difference
[01:28:11] <Cork> bjensen: if you check the dropdown on the left, jsfiddle already wrapps the code in onload
[01:28:15] <pneftali> document.getElementById("private-form").reset(); 	doesn't seem to work in chrome
[01:28:31] <bjensen> Cork, xec, ok thanks guys :)
[01:30:29] <xec_> bjensen: i have had people "tidy" my code and moved my script tags to <head> before :P
[01:30:39] <xec_> well, i say people, has happened once ;)
[01:31:14] <Cork> well it is tidier
[01:31:24] <Cork> html should REALLY have an async way to put scripts in the head
[01:31:25] <xec_> yep, but non-working :D
[01:31:30] <xec_> that is true
[01:31:43] <Cork> cause thats really where they belong
[01:32:53] <xec_> in any case, my point was: docready is slightly more robust, while scripts at bottom is slightly quicker
[01:33:29] <Cork> its quicker cause the rendering of the page doesn't wait for the script to be fetched and parsed
[01:33:37] <Cork> nothing else
[01:33:46] <anli_> I am putting a div above a :text, now I want to have the same font on the div, so  I am trying to get the font from the :text by using .css('font'), that will apparently be blank
[01:34:04] <anli_> Whats the procedure of getting the calculated font?
[01:34:11] <Xotix> I'm using show(slide). The div which appears got a border. Is it possible to show the border left while it is sliding?
[01:34:29] <Cork> anli_: create a placeholder element put the text in it and fetch its width/height
[01:34:38] <Cork> anli_: sadly there isn't a fast way
[01:34:39] <Xotix> Can i just give it to ui-effects-wrapper?
[01:34:39] <anli_> I cannot rely on placeholder support here
[01:34:50] <Cork> uh
[01:35:10] <anli_> Seems that ie9 does not support it
[01:35:16] <Cork> $('<span/>').addClass('font-tester').text(my_text).width()
[01:35:19] <Cork> it does
[01:35:26] <anli_> But is there a certain placeholder tag?
[01:35:32] <anli_> I only know it as an attr
[01:36:02] <Cork> uh didn't you ask about calculating the font???
[01:36:15] <Cork> placeholder is an html5 attribute ya
[01:36:23] <Cork> but it has little to do with font
[01:36:30] <anli_> Cork: Yes, and I was suggested using placeholder
[01:36:41] <Cork> todo what?
[01:36:48] <anli_> <Cork> anli_: create a placeholder element put the text in it and fetch its width/height
[01:37:07] <Cork> i didn't litterly mean an element of type placeholder >_<
[01:37:19] <Cork> just a temp element where you put the text and fetch its width
[01:37:24] <anli_> I have already tried to use the attr placeholder, is only blank in ie
[01:37:36] <anli_> ah
[01:37:38] <Cork> ya, ie doesn't support html5 placeholder
[01:37:51] <Cork> (though that has nothing to do with the question)
[01:38:01] <anli_> Now I see what you mean, but what can I do with width and height?
[01:38:15] <anli_> You suggested me to make a dummy div and measure it
[01:38:20] <anli_> right?
[01:38:23] <Cork> yes
[01:38:30] <Cork> but it needs to be inline-block not block
[01:38:34] <anli_> yes
[01:38:50] <anli_> But what can I do with the measurements?
[01:38:51] <Cork> its sadly the only way to calculate dimentions for text in js :/
[01:39:14] <Cork> anli_: uh.. to calculate the font
[01:39:35] <Cork> what other calculation do you want to do?
[01:39:37] <anli_> I have put a div above a :text, and the problem I have is that the font for text I put in the div is not the same as text I would have inputted in the :text
[01:39:49] <Cork> anli_: whats :text ?
[01:39:53] <anli_> Ah, with calculating font, I refer to firebug slang
[01:39:54] <anli_> Sorry
[01:40:01] <anli_> jquery lingo for <input type="text">
[01:40:07] <Cork> ya, an input
[01:40:12] <anli_> Made up by me, so maybe thats why you have not heard about it
[01:40:13] <Cork> *ah
[01:40:23] <Cork> just call it an input
[01:40:27] <anli_> Its hard to communicate with chat :)
[01:40:32] <anli_> ok
[01:40:39] <Cork> not if you use the proper terms :)
[01:40:41] <anli_> Now we are synced however
[01:41:13] <Cork> anli_: are you trying to generate a placeholder?
[01:41:14] <anli_> Maybe I should try to use .css('font' on the parent chain of the text
[01:41:18] <anli_> true
[01:41:33] <anli_> I found a lib that I was not content with
[01:41:50] <anli_> It uses labels and stuff
[01:42:00] <anli_> So I could maybe write a 50 rows lib easily myself
[01:42:24] <anli_> I am almost done with it btw
[01:42:31] <Cork> anli_: http://jsfiddle.net/WUBeU/
[01:42:50] <Cork> wrote that up a few months back
[01:43:28] <anli_> Ah
[01:43:31] <Cork> opps the marker isn't in there
[01:43:44] <anli_> Please, update the script then :)
[01:43:54] <anli_> Ah, you mean that the markup is missing?
[01:44:25] <anli_> hm, window.app.compatibility, strange
[01:45:19] <anli_> I consider putting actual text in the input, that would be so much easier
[01:45:22] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/WUBeU/1/
[01:45:25] <anli_> Instead of having a div above
[01:45:41] <Cork> anli_: doesn't work with input type="password"
[01:45:50] <Cork> thats why i have the overlay
[01:46:10] <anli_> It can be done without overlays if its ok to post the default text, which it actually is
[01:46:12] <eshlox> how run function when user write letter or number in input? i want exclude when user hit space, backspace, key arrows, etc
[01:46:25] <Cork> anli_: no
[01:46:32] <Cork> type password will just show dots
[01:46:42] <Cork> and you can't change type on a password field in ie
[01:46:43] <anli_> It doesnt matter a lot if the string "email" comes with the posting if the user is not inputting an email
[01:46:47] <anli_> true true
[01:46:56] <anli_> Thats a blocker to my solution
[01:47:14] <Cork> i did the inline solution first
[01:47:20] <Cork> before i started using it
[01:47:21] <Cork> :)
[01:47:27] <Cork> it broke on the first form :D
[01:47:42] <anli_> I read the code you have written, seems so complicated compared to the task
[01:47:50] <anli_> lowercasing and stuff
[01:48:05] <anli_> you also use the attr placeholder which will not validate
[01:48:06] <trond-> hi room. I have a bunch of fieldset and checkboxes inside these. When I click submit and I have clicked some boxes in one fieldset and one in another fieldset, I get them both. How can I collect the values from the checkboxes within the fieldset?
[01:48:14] <anli_> Oh, it will
[01:48:19] <Cork> anli_: thats just some extra classes
[01:48:37] <Cork> anli_: as long as your using html5 its valid
[01:48:40] <anli_> attr('placeholder') would maybe be attr('data-placeholder')
[01:48:45] <anli_> true true
[01:48:46] <Cork> and thats the point
[01:49:01] <Cork> this only does anything if the browser doesn't support placehoder
[01:49:05] <anli_> Hm, you put a span above, right
[01:49:11] <Cork> yup
[01:49:13] <Cork> $.support.placeholder = (document.createElement('input').placeholder !== undefined);
[01:49:18] <Cork> thats the magic
[01:49:20] <anli_> yeah
[01:50:08] <anli_> I like the idea of fading up text in placeholders so maybe I should never use internal browser supports for it
[01:50:15] <Cork> this.nodeName.toLowerCase() is just for styling
[01:50:33] <Cork> that sounds like a bad idea
[01:50:34] <anli_> having a class name thats not constant seems strange
[01:50:49] <Cork> anli_: its constant
[01:50:55] <Cork> its input for input fields
[01:51:00] <Cork> and textarea for textareas
[01:51:25] <anli_> Having a placeholder in a textarea is something I will not need
[01:51:40] <Cork> it doens't cust you anything so :)
[01:51:45] <Cork> *cost
[01:51:51] <anli_> produces code
[01:52:05] <Cork> it costs you two selectors
[01:52:11] <Cork> the rest of the code is shared
[01:53:00] <Cork> and its there to provide the equvalent of what html5 browsers support
[01:57:23] <anli_> Its an art to only produce code that solves your problem and nothing else, and textareas are not part of my problem
[02:03:14] <anli_> How do I get the font for inputs?
[02:07:00] <Cork> anli_: you can grab the computedStyle
[02:08:19] <anli_> Seems that there is a font-family on the input
[02:08:36] <Cork> sure
[02:08:53] <Cork> if you've set it in you css
[02:09:16] <anli_> its there anyway
[02:09:35] <anli_> If I click "reset" in jsfiddle, do I create a new fiddle?
[02:11:03] <xec_> fork?
[02:13:17] <anli_> http://jsfiddle.net/34835/3/ <-- my contribution to the placeholder community :)
[02:14:40] <anli_> works in ie and ff, that good enough for me
[02:14:55] <Cork> uh you don't need it for ff
[02:15:53] <anli_> Now I it in both
[02:16:27] <anli_> Then I dont have to use the autodetection code
[02:16:33] <Monkeypaws> heya, any idea why this isn't changing my #controls2 div?  http://pastebin.com/RRjQqR5E
[02:16:48] <nFFF> anli_, usually you'd do that different
[02:16:53] <nFFF> just inline the label text
[02:17:00] <anli_> What do you mean?
[02:18:05] <xec_> anli_: you're missing a focus event too
[02:18:29] <anli_> Ah, true
[02:18:31] <xec_> like, if i use the keyboard to swap fields
[02:18:40] <anli_> Maybe I should use that instead of input.mousedown
[02:19:09] <anli_> I change mousedown to focus
[02:19:34] <Cork> anli_: i don't really get why you did all those changes
[02:20:02] <anli_> Changes? I was writing it from scratch
[02:20:02] <Cork> especially as your code only works once
[02:20:21] <anli_> It only works once you say?
[02:20:35] <Cork> if you append to the page it won't catch it
[02:21:13] <anli_> catch what?
[02:21:22] <Cork> the new input fields
[02:21:28] <nFFF> anli_ http://jsfiddle.net/Yb5Vm/
[02:21:30] <anli_> I am not intending to create more fields
[02:23:57] <nFFF> probably put the input into avariable in my example
[02:24:06] <anli_> Using focus() instead was neat, could also cut down the code
[02:24:07] <nFFF> rather then keep transversing the DOM
[02:24:39] <anli_> Why not go through the DOM?
[02:24:44] <anli_> It costs almost nothing
[02:24:45] <nFFF> its taxing
[02:24:53] <anli_> I have never had a problem with it
[02:25:15] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Yb5Vm/1/
[02:25:21] <nFFF> thats how I'd do your placeholder task
[02:25:26] <nFFF> works in all browsers
[02:25:47] <anli_> Why should I use that?
[02:26:11] <anli_> Why should I use a font thats not appropriate?
[02:26:19] <nFFF> You can change the font
[02:26:29] <anli_> I fetch it from the input
[02:26:41] <nFFF> You said yours only works in FF and IE :S
[02:26:57] <anli_> No, I say it works in IE and FF
[02:27:32] <anli_> My current solution: http://jsfiddle.net/34835/4/
[02:28:19] <anli_> Hm, maybe I should not catch mousedown on the div, will bleed through
[02:28:29] <MikeH> Hrm, am I doing something wrong here? I'm trying to get the value of a select when found using .children(). So I'm doing something like $row.children('select.someclass :selected').val(); however I just get undefined
[02:28:56] <anli_> did not
[02:32:30] <xec_> MikeH: the selector in .children() will filter on children *only* - at the moment you have a space in there which indicates a descendant
[02:33:18] <xec_> MikeH: if you want to search through all descendants you can try .find()
[02:33:59] <xec_> but you don't really need the :selected part
[02:34:21] <MikeH> Yeah, I've just read the docs on val(). I've only just figured that out
[02:34:22] <xec_> i suspect $row.children('select.someclass').val(); will do what you want
[02:34:38] <MikeH> So .children() only works with direct children
[02:34:44] <MikeH> it doesn't transverse other children?
[02:34:46] <Jagan_> Hi, I need Regex for decimal values either positive or negative..can anyone help me?
[02:34:58] <Whirl3d> MikeH you want .find()
[02:35:14] <MikeH> Yes, .find() works. I'm just trying to establish why children does not :)
[02:35:14] <xec_> MikeH: yes, childrens children are "descendants" and not "children"
[02:35:23] <MikeH> Thanks. That clears things up. Thank you.
[02:37:54] <xec_> Jagan_: to find somewhere, or to validate?
[02:39:25] <itatitat> ey guys
[02:39:40] <itatitat> the instruction load() can load as well javascript code?
[02:39:53] <sunbeam> damn i need to use a font which is 11mb and there is no way i can use it apart from with image replacement. what would you guys do? fontsquirrel has 2mb max, font2web has 512kb max
[02:39:57] <itatitat> because In other files Ive code of javascript
[02:40:03] <itatitat> I would like to execute it
[02:40:08] <itatitat> when I load the page
[02:40:14] <Cork> sunbeam: don't dubble post
[02:40:28] <sunbeam> ok
[02:40:33] <Cork> itatitat: if you have a script tag in load it will be parsed
[02:40:41] <Cork> itatitat: it won't be parsed inline thought
[02:41:00] <Cork> itatitat: if you just want to run a script use getScript
[02:41:14] <itatitat> jummm, good answer!
[02:41:21] <Jagan_> xec, i want to validate.
[02:42:12] <peiper> hi does jQuery / jQuery UI have some kind of tooltips?
[02:43:31] <Cork> not yet

[02:45:56] <arepie> Hello, i have a normal page with jquerymobile, what i did is, using jquery function $.post and and append into the page with <a href data-role="button"> and it doesnt show a button, only a normal link
[02:46:00] <xec_> aha!
[02:46:12] <arepie> how can i fix this?
[02:47:11] <dezzz> Hey can someone help me understand the plugin example in the jquery docs? I pasted it here for conveniance: http://pastebin.com/4JY9ENHb
[02:47:26] <dezzz> Line 8 why do we do var $this = $(this),
[02:47:30] <xec_> Jagan_: i missed a slash in there - also, maybe you want a limit on the number of decimals?
[02:47:54] <xec_> ?eval /^-?\d+.?\d*$/.test("1541f23")
[02:47:54] <Cork> dezzz: caching the jquery wrapped dom element
[02:47:55] <bot-t> xec_: true
[02:47:56] <xec_> f LOL
[02:47:57] <dezzz> i thought "This often leads to developers unnecessarily wrapping the this keyword (again) in the jQuery function. "
[02:48:06] <xec_> ?eval /^-?\d+\.?\d*$/.test("1541f23")
[02:48:06] <bot-t> xec_: false
[02:48:29] <Cork> dezzz: its the $(this).something;$(this).something;$(this).something;$(this).something
[02:48:49] <dezzz> Cork> http://pastebin.com/MPnBcA6f
[02:50:34] <dezzz> Cork> so when we do $(this) it wrap the jquery object so we got $($this) no ?
[02:50:53] <Cork> no
[02:51:00] <Cork> $this is just a variable name
[02:51:05] <Cork> it has no special meaning
[02:51:18] <Cork> you do $this instead of $(this)
[02:52:19] <Whirl3d> dezzz, wait... that gets confusing.   $this does nothing unless you use it as a variable name like var $this=$(this); People like to use the $varname to indicated that the varname holds a jquery object
[02:52:30] <Whirl3d> but it's not a functional thing, it's a naming convention thng
[02:52:35] <_bart> Hi, why am I unable to set the value of this slider: http://jsfiddle.net/ADxdX/ ?
[02:52:44] <Xotix> i've an element which has set background-image via css. This element is within an div which has show(slide) applied. The problme now is, that the background image isn't shown. Why? Could it be due to the use of show('slide,..)?
[02:53:24] <anli__> Can I get the position of an element relative it closest nonstatic parent?
[02:53:43] <sonnie> hi there, i have a question about 'sortable' function from jquery-ui. i want to get the sequence number when sorting a list. how?
[02:54:31] <dezzz> Cork> Whirl3d> ah ok think i got it
[02:54:44] <dezzz> http://pastebin.com/4JY9ENHb
[02:54:58] <dezzz> Line 23 what does this do: tooltip : tooltip?
[02:55:53] <xec_> it sets the tooltip to tooltip
[02:55:59] <dezzz> but it's not a string
[02:56:00] <sonnie> here is an example: <ul><li>item1<li>item2<li>item3</ul>. after sorting i got: item3, item1, item2. how to get these numbers?
[02:56:02] <Whirl3d> dezzz, here's the thing. IN the quote you pasted earlier, it says, "in the immediate context of the plugin" once in side the .each command, you are no longer in the immediate context. You're in the context of the .each command.
[02:56:04] <dezzz> or an int
[02:56:26] <dezzz> Whirl3d> right ok
[02:56:47] <dezzz> xec_> it's not a string or an int what is tooltip ?
[02:57:02] <xec_> dezzz: it's a div element, see line 10
[02:57:12] <dezzz> OH!
[02:57:15] <dezzz> right ok thanks a lot
[02:57:39] <dezzz> missed that
[02:58:07] <dezzz> well actually i had modified the example and removed the tooltip = =(
[03:01:34] <peiper> is there an $(selector).onload function?

[03:04:55] <arepie> Hello, i have a normal page with jquerymobile, what i did is, using jquery function $.post and and append into the page with <a href data-role="button"> and it doesnt show a button, only a normal link.. how to fix this?
[03:06:07] <Whirl3d> aerpie, did you check your csss to see if there was UI button appearance class?
[03:07:40] <Whirl3d> did you check to see that jquery mobile was loading? Can you make a fiddle so we can see the rpoblem reproduced?
[03:07:44] <Xotix> .css('height', (height + 55));  means height + 55px, right?
[03:08:30] <Whirl3d> if height is a variable name
[03:08:55] <peiper_> dezzz, kinda tried some methods nothing working for now >_<
[03:08:58] <arepie> http://jsfiddle.net/vRr82/2/ here is an example which i failed to do so
[03:09:00] <Xotix> Whirl3d: yes, somehow it adds me much more then 55, hmm. But thanks
[03:09:43] <azk> I'm trying to find some thing to read regarding async callbacks
[03:09:44] <Whirl3d> arepie, looks like a button to me
[03:09:57] <azk> anyone point me the right direction?
[03:10:20] <peiper_> .on('load' does not work but .live("click" works dafuq?
[03:10:24] <arepie> Whirl3d: when you click the button, a new button will be append below the button, can you see it?
[03:10:39] <NodeX> ?die
[03:10:39] <bot-t> .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[03:11:12] <Whirl3d> aerpie, I don't see where you the new button is appended. It calls alert and that's it

[03:15:05] <arkascha> Hi all, I really could use some help, been puling my hair on this one already:
[03:15:26] <Rahul_> HI all,
[03:15:29] <arkascha> I have two dialogs (form tags), each contain an input field that I activate a datepicker on.
[03:15:33] <Rahul_> is anybody there
[03:15:36] <arkascha> All works fine, except:
[03:15:51] <Rahul_> hello chirs
[03:16:00] <arkascha> In one (!) of the two identical dialogs picking a date via the datepicker does NOT update the chosen date.
[03:16:26] <arkascha> I can change the date manually and all workds fine.
[03:16:28] <arkascha> But the datepicker is useless, only in that dialog.
[03:16:35] <arkascha> I checked the markup, absolutely identical.
[03:16:38] <Rahul_> arkascha
[03:16:45] <Rahul_> i have a question
[03:16:49] <Rahul_> about the jquery
[03:17:02] <Rahul_> ??????
[03:17:28] <Rahul_> i want to get the current row of selected cell
[03:17:31] <arkascha> ?
[03:17:59] <Rahul_> ????\
[03:18:20] <arkascha> Take a look at the documentation for jqueries 'parents' method.
[03:18:27] <Ste_uk> quick question: if i were to make a division which would be used as a wrapper (over flow hidden, position relative), then put another division inside it that was position absolute and has a top of 0px then when an arrow is hovered over it puts a minus on the top it would scroll up in ALL browsers (IE7 and above)?
[03:18:30] <Rahul_> okey
[03:20:35] <Ste_uk> i would use jQuery to do something like $(".arrowUp").hover(function(){ $("#frame").animate({ top : "-=10px" }); }); but need to know if this would work in all browsers if someone knows
[03:20:53] <peiper_> i hate jquery
[03:20:57] <Ste_uk> ?
[03:20:58] <peiper_> and javascript
[03:21:00] <Ste_uk> jQuery is ace
[03:21:01] <Ste_uk> lol
[03:21:01] <peiper_> and all dat shit
[03:21:34] <peiper_> in a document ready i bind a tooltip to an image it wont work if i put an alert above it works
[03:21:43] <peiper_> are u fucking kiding me gaylordscript?
[03:22:44] <_bart> Hi, could somebody please take a look at why the slider isn't updated when I set the value: http://jsfiddle.net/ADxdX/ ?
[03:22:47] <Rahul_> thanks arkascha
[03:23:16] <Rahul_> thanx arkascha... thnx it works.. thanks
[03:24:47] <Rahul_> hi bart
[03:24:53] <Rahul_> what is the issue
[03:25:24] <Rahul_> you can use like this $("#s").val('100').slider();​
[03:25:26] <[1]Bram> hi guys. I want to save a js object using json to a cookie and retrieve it afterwards. Does jquery support this out of the box or should I use some plugin. If I need a plugin do you know a good one?
[03:25:29] <_bart> Rahul_: the slider is not moving, as it should.
[03:25:46] <_bart> Rahul_: only the value of the input has changed. and I tried adding .slider();
[03:26:12] <_bart> Rahul_: the slider should be half-way
[03:26:15] <_bart> (the handle)
[03:26:19] <Sevet> hi, i'm doing "$('#mytable tbody').click(function(e) { console.log($(e.target)); })"... the handler gets called once on the TD clicked on but doesn't bubble up to the TR (where i want to handle it) - does anyone know why?
[03:27:00] <Rahul_> okey wait _bart let me look at you live example
[03:27:34] <Rahul_> _bart wht is your email? we can communicate further through mail or something
[03:27:35] <[1]Bram> @Sevet, sounds you need to use delegates
[03:27:59] <[1]Bram> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:29:16] <Sevet> ok thanks, i'll look at that
[03:29:21] <_bart> Rahul_ received my message?
[03:29:42] <Rahul_> yes i got you message
[03:30:54] <Rahul_> yes i got you message bart. i sent you the gmail invitation.. accept it
[03:33:38] <niels__> I'm populating some dropdowns, that's fetching json from a php script. the first selectlist works fine, but can't for the life of me figure out what's wrong with the next. could anyone have a look? http://pastebin.com/0EtExU5m thanks :)
[03:34:59] <Sevet> bram: thanks - looks like that's working :)
[03:36:41] <_bart> Got the solution: $("#s").val(100).slider('refresh');​​​​​​
[03:38:13] <swe_ET> niels__: tried changing the name :  "type" to something else?
[03:38:32] <[1]Bram> Sevet: nice, it's faster to use delegates a well for what you want.
[03:38:53] <niels__> swe_ET: What do you mean? Which.. one?
[03:39:21] <swe_ET>  $.getJSON("model.php",{fab: fab, type: type},
[03:39:52] <swe_ET> 1:1 , 2:2 ?
[03:39:57] <niels__> swe_ET: when I enter the $_GET['type'] manually in the URL for model.php it works perfectly fine
[03:40:29] <niels__> for example: model.php?fab=braun&type=shave it spits out the json perfectly fine, just as it does with the types.php
[03:41:21] <swe_ET> niels__:  whats the diff between left and right fab according to you in : fab:fab ?
[03:42:14] <niels__> swe_ET: left is ?fab= right is the value
[03:42:46] <niels__> swe_ET: so its {fab: fabvalue, type: typevalue}
[03:43:28] <swe_ET> niels__:  name them that then ..
[03:44:18] <niels__> swe_ET: just did. didn't change a thing.
[03:44:29] <niels__> still no response, and the alert() won't fire
[03:44:50] <swe_ET> niels__:  jsfiddle current state
[03:45:23] <niels__> swe_ET: that would be a bit hard, since the .php's get's the json from a closed navision database
[03:45:56] <swe_ET> ??!..
[03:46:22] <swe_ET> niels__:  update the pastebin / jfiddle
[03:47:50] <niels__> swe_ET: http://pastebin.com/rLYdjp8E
[03:48:26] <swe_ET> niels__:  why are you looping d ?
[03:49:02] <swe_ET> niels__:  for (var i = 0; i < d.length; i++) {  <-- d ?
[03:49:55] <swe_ET> niels__:  I guess you get some warning in the console about undefined d ?
[03:50:31] <niels__> swe_ET: haha thanks :) that was it..
[03:50:56] <swe_ET> niels__: np
[03:53:55] <Gwaihir_> Hi. I'm trying to detect when an ongoing animation has finished. There isn't some sort of flag set & removed, is there?
[03:54:47] <Gwaihir_> Could I query for a style attribute? If so.. which? (I see some overflow-x stuff flash by but haven't found out what exactly yet..)
[03:55:18] <quicksilver> Gwaihir_: use the callback.
[03:55:58] <Gwaihir_> Ah yeah.. unfortunately, my script runs on top of the app (from WebDriver).
[03:56:10] <Gwaihir_> So I can execute stuff, but not modify the scripts themself :(
[03:56:28] <Christer> How can i check if input format is correct for: Hours:minutes:seconds

[04:12:17] <coachz> Anyone know how to get Colorbox to read content from an element in another page?  I'm trying this but it just gets the entire page.   http://pastebin.com/kraKA4NB      http://pastebin.com/DR4ftT5e
[04:20:12] <Christer> coachz: When catching the value, i guess its stored in some variable? $(variable).find('#element').each(function() { alert("This is what i found: " +this); }); -
[04:20:25] <Christer> i could be totally of charts here :P never heard of colorbox
[04:20:46] <coachz> i dont' think so
[04:21:02] <coachz> Colorbox is one of jQuery's most popular plugins
[04:21:12] <coachz> the code i currently have returns the entire page
[04:21:26] <coachz> so if it was getting just the element i specified it would return just that

[04:23:47] <cambazz> so i am using this, and but using user agent switcher i am sending IE6
[04:24:05] <cambazz> but is this done at browser level, or server level
[04:24:12] <xec_> condcoms are client side
[04:24:41] <SavemeWithJquery> can someone help me with the above?
[04:24:43] <SavemeWithJquery> i am stuck
[04:25:11] <xec_> SavemeWithJquery: what do you have so far? what's working and what's not?
[04:25:33] <SavemeWithJquery> well i can take a screenshot from my webcam thanks to a free open source project

[04:25:42] <SavemeWithJquery> i am trying to make the timer
[04:26:04] <xec_> SavemeWithJquery: you can make timers in javascript with setTimeout()
[04:26:16] <SavemeWithJquery> i am using this one
[04:26:17] <SavemeWithJquery> http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2011/04/jquery-webcam-photobooth/
[04:26:28] <SavemeWithJquery> i was trying do it by delay()
[04:26:45] <xec_> .delay() is for jQuery animations (only)
[04:26:46] <nFFF> Any ideas why $(ele).text() returns: CoolMAX® IIIa Bullet Stab & Spike Proof Vest, but $(ele).text().indexOf('CoolMAX®'); is returning -1?
[04:26:51] <SavemeWithJquery> oh i see
[04:26:57] <SavemeWithJquery> let's try with setTimeout
[04:26:59] <nFFF> .text() returns a string right?
[04:27:35] <xec_> nFFF: yes, maybe the ® is throwing it off?
[04:27:46] <nFFF> works with the bots :|
[04:28:08] <nFFF> I have: console.log(that.text(), that.text().indexOf('CoolMAX®'));
[04:28:17] <nFFF> console outputs: CoolMAX® IIIa Bullet Stab & Spike Proof Vest
[04:28:17] <nFFF> 											 -1
[04:29:02] <nFFF> ok yes thanks xec
[04:29:06] <nFFF> was the symbol
[04:30:44] <SavemeWithJquery> shouldn't this work?
[04:30:45] <SavemeWithJquery> setTimeout("HELLO",3000);
[04:31:04] <xec_> SavemeWithJquery: the first parameter should be a function to execute
[04:31:05] <itatitat> guys I've an strange situation
[04:31:36] <coachz> SavemeWithJquery:   "HELLO" should be a function
[04:31:37] <SavemeWithJquery> oh
[04:31:40] <SavemeWithJquery> ok
[04:31:42] <xec_> SavemeWithJquery: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[04:31:47] <coachz> SavemeWithJquery:   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1495903/jquery-settimeout-not-working
[04:32:20] <itatitat> Ive this code
[04:32:21] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/hXXTn/
[04:32:29] <itatitat> in the final of my html
[04:32:31] <nFFF> Fuark waste so much time forgetting .indexOf doesn't return a false value if its not int he string
[04:32:38] <nFFF> why wouldn't they just have it return fuarking false
[04:32:48] <itatitat> the problem is that the trigger run many times, repeeat a lot the execution
[04:32:53] <itatitat> and I want only one
[04:33:23] <johnkpaul> nFFF: because it's what C, C++, Java, and more do
[04:33:39] <johnkpaul> not that I agree with the decision necessarily
[04:34:17] <johnkpaul> you can use regex.test() if you want a boolean
[04:34:38] <nFFF> Ill just compare to !== -1
[04:34:46] <nFFF> just kepe forgetting as I rarely use the method
[04:35:08] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[04:35:16] <SavemeWithJquery> ok now how can i use overlay imageS?
[04:35:46] <xec_> SavemeWithJquery: i don't even know what you mean by that. maybe css?
[04:36:04] <itatitat> ok is working
[04:36:18] <SavemeWithJquery> well i suppose that could be a css and php issue
[04:36:27] <SavemeWithJquery> so no jquery stuff
[04:36:36] <SavemeWithJquery> for now i can't even make the timer work
[04:36:37] <SavemeWithJquery> :S
[04:36:45] <SavemeWithJquery> the set timeout
[04:39:05] <Carlitta87> hey, im using Epoch JavaScript Calendar and i have 2 on one page. wen i change the year for the first calendar the year doesnt change for the second one. can sumone assist me into making it possible for wen i click the calendar the current date always shows up first? PLEASE let me know
[04:39:16] <Carlitta87> i cud really use the assist
[04:39:19] <Carlitta87> im a beginner
[04:39:41] <Carlitta87> n ive been forced to do this for asked to do this
[04:39:52] <Carlitta87> sry
[04:39:56] <Carlitta87> ive been asked to do this
[04:40:11] <xec_> ?demo @ Carlitta87
[04:40:11] <bot-t> Carlitta87, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:42:09] <Carlitta87> its a bit large to add it to jsfiddle...it also has sumthing with XM data...
[04:42:32] <Carlitta87> but it looks like this: http://www.epoch-calendar.com/support/epochprime/setup.html
[04:43:33] <xec_> if it's too large for a jsfiddle, it's probably too complex for an irc question too
[04:44:15] <Carlitta87> sigh
[04:45:48] <Carlitta87> theres nothing really wrong with wat i have
[04:45:49] <Carlitta87> tho
[04:46:17] <Carlitta87> the date just need to be auto set to the current date
[04:46:18] <Carlitta87> thats all
[04:49:40] <NodeX> In  general how do people stop bots from clicking on certain links - i.e rating links and so on
[04:49:55] <NodeX> (and calling the ratings in via Ajax is not an option)
[04:50:16] <DuRa`> is there any known bug with mouseenter and an each loop?
[04:50:20] <Cork> NodeX: nofollow
[04:50:33] <NodeX> nofollow means it doesn't follow page rank
[04:50:34] <NodeX> lol
[04:50:40] <NodeX> it still spiders!
[04:50:46] <Cork> ouch
[04:50:52] <Cork> didn't know that
[04:50:54] <NodeX> I always thought it was no follow
[04:50:59] <NodeX> until I tested it!
[04:51:06] <Cork> rel="nofollow"
[04:51:20] <NodeX> a robots would be the only way then probably (on the end href)
[04:51:32] <Cork> ja
[04:51:33] <NodeX> nofollow*
[04:51:36] <Cork> *ya
[04:52:04] <JA|2> hi
[04:52:10] <Cork> NodeX: js links is normally safe too
[04:52:15] <Cork> that is no hrefs
[04:52:35] <xec_> DuRa`: not that i know of. is your code live somewhere?
[04:52:59] <DuRa`> unfortunately not for public access
[04:53:10] <NodeX> they dont degrade though Cork :/
[04:53:18] <DuRa`> ill try to reproduce it on jsfiddle
[04:53:23] <Cork> NodeX: ya i know
[04:53:27] <Cork> (and i feel you)
[04:53:30] <NodeX> Disallow: /@/f21d2012b88b099cd031a59aa2f869186e1c0b62/
[04:53:35] <NodeX> I fink is da best way
[04:53:45] <Cork> robots.txt is so clonkt too
[04:54:00] <NodeX> I suppose shopping carts have the same problems
[04:54:14] <Cork> no
[04:54:24] <Cork> shopping carts normally don't work without js :/
[04:55:14] <NodeX> From what I read Shopping carts use robots.txt too
[04:55:23] <NodeX> ( the ones that work with no javascript)
[04:55:45] <Cork> ya, prob
[04:55:55] <Cork> most i've seen don't thought >_>
[04:56:36] <mytoz> I don't get it
[04:56:55] <mytoz> I find it easier to add javascript after
[04:57:25] <mytoz> there are edge cases, though
[04:57:27] <NodeX> In general I keep the links inside mt href's and  ajax request where I can
[04:57:46] <NodeX> but it's a problem for bots because they like to follow these links sometimes
[04:57:58] <NodeX> and I dont want bots following my ratings stars!
[04:58:18] <Cork> NodeX: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=93708
[04:58:36] <Cork> so, ya robots.txt looks like the only ay
[04:58:38] <Cork> *way
[04:58:53] <NodeX> yeh, it's a shame really
[04:59:08] <Cork> wish you could set the noindex on the link :)
[04:59:14] <NodeX> yeh me too
[04:59:16] <Cork> that would be cool
[05:00:41] <gabriel9|work> i can't add jQuery to web page, but i need it. So is there any way to use it like in my module. It would be only available to my module
[05:01:15] <Cork> gabriel9|work: not really
[05:01:38] <Cork> you can load it and then release the public variables though
[05:01:49] <Cork> ?.noConflict @ gabriel9|work
[05:01:49] <bot-t> gabriel9|work, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[05:02:08] <gabriel9|work> that is one way
[05:02:21] <gabriel9|work> in fact i need .css() method only
[05:02:31] <Cork> uh... why?
[05:02:42] <Cork> if css is all you need, just use style
[05:02:52] <gabriel9|work> window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('someID')).top
[05:02:56] <Cork> domelm.style.variable = 'value'
[05:03:05] <gabriel9|work> in FF return 233px
[05:03:08] <gabriel9|work> in chrome auto
[05:03:16] <gabriel9|work> so here you see the problem
[05:03:27] <Cork> style ddoesn't use getComputedStyle
[05:03:29] <Cork> sorry
[05:03:32] <Cork> css()
[05:03:55] <gabriel9|work> css() don't use it?
[05:04:00] <Cork> no
[05:04:32] <gabriel9|work> then back to IDE and code it again with that info :)
[05:04:38] <gabriel9|work> thanks Cork
[05:05:03] <Cork> hmm
[05:05:12] <Cork> looks like i remembered wrong
[05:05:20] <Cork> curCSS = getComputedStyle || currentStyle;
[05:05:25] <Cork> so it defenitly uses it
[05:05:33] <gabriel9|work> damnation
[05:06:02] <gabriel9|work> well there is also issue with this stupidity: when in css file you have some top : 0;
[05:06:36] <pachet> gabriel9|work: just take that one portion from the jq source, gutting the rest
[05:06:38] <pachet> not too hard to do
[05:06:49] <pachet> ?g jquery source github @ gabriel9|work
[05:06:50] <bot-t> gabriel9|work, jquery/jquery  GitHub - https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[05:07:38] <gabriel9|work> ok
[05:07:43] <gabriel9|work> i will try
[05:07:48] <Cork> gabriel9|work: ok, so css uses curCSS for everything except a few special cases
[05:07:58] <Cork> ?src function getWH(
[05:07:59] <bot-t> Line#6616 - "function getWH( elem, name, extra ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6616
[05:08:01] <DuRa`> xec_: i cant reproduce it, u mind if i explain my point ?
[05:08:07] <Cork> thats the line your interested in
[05:08:41] <xec_> DuRa`: go for it, maybe pastebin your code too?
[05:08:47] <DuRa`> sure
[05:09:05] <gabriel9|work> ok, i go try now all this
[05:09:10] <gabriel9|work> thanks
[05:09:27] <tocka> Hey, I have a form with 2 submit buttons, how could I make that if you would press on one you would be redirected to 1 url and if on 2nd that to another (Im using this to susbscribe to 2 different things (Using mail chimp))
[05:09:41] <DuRa`> okay the paste first: http://pastebin.com/XXhFs4wY
[05:10:10] <Cork> tocka: bind a click on the submit buttons and change the action attribute on the form
[05:10:43] <anli__> Is there an event for when an element is becoming visible because some of its parent has changed its display style to something else than none?
[05:10:49] <tocka> Cork ok, will try to
[05:10:49] <DuRa`> the problem is i the mouseenter function, it does its job well, passes me the right value of the added width, but if the mouseenter event is triggered the second time, i just get 0
[05:10:50] <anli__> (from none)
[05:11:13] <Cork> anli__: no, not nativly
[05:11:35] <Cork> in other words, no, only faked events
[05:11:57] <xec_> DuRa`: are you nesting lists?
[05:12:35] <NodeX> ?mouseOffset
[05:12:38] <bot-t> NodeX, #3099 (Sortable dragging mouse offset broken)  jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3099
[05:13:00] <DuRa`> sorry, how do u mean "nesting"? like if there are more lists inside this list im tryin to iterate?
[05:13:10] <DuRa`> if so, no
[05:14:00] <xec_> DuRa`: what does your html look like? the reason i ask is i see you're doing $(this).find(".subMenu").children("ul") - and 'this' is a <li>, right?
[05:14:59] <xec_> DuRa`: and the selector $("#topCategories li") is going to select all <li>'s that are descendants of #topCategories (any number of levels down)
[05:15:02] <DuRa`> right
[05:15:17] <DuRa`> ah
[05:15:32] <DuRa`> so also the next ul li's ?
[05:15:36] <xec_> exactly
[05:15:43] <DuRa`> k got that
[05:15:58] <DuRa`> so i just have to be more specific with the selectors ?
[05:16:02] <xec_> yes
[05:16:09] <DuRa`> k thx, ill try that
[05:16:21] <gabriel9|work> Cork: i solve ti with plain old JS :/ i wonder will it break again
[05:16:37] <tocka> Cork, would it be something like this?
[05:17:32] <Cork> tocka: like what?
[05:18:46] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. I am trying to catch a .click() event on a table cell. The table, however, is dynamically loaded using an ajax .load() call. Thus the contained cells' click events aren't being caught. However I found that sticking the click() event handler in the .load() function's callback method solves this. The problem now is that the table gets updated again (due to another event), and after this update, my click event handler no longer wo
[05:18:46] <g[r]eek> rks. Any ideas?
[05:18:54] <tocka> lol
[05:18:55] <tocka> minute
[05:19:05] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/fLBVZ/4/
[05:19:15] <xec_> ?on @ g[r]eek
[05:19:16] <bot-t> g[r]eek, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:19:36] <Cork> g[r]eek: more specifically the delegate secion
[05:20:26] <xec_> g[r]eek: what you do is bind to a parent element (that is always present) and supply the table cell selector as a filter
[05:20:38] <tocka> Cork, nvm it works, thank you
[05:21:32] <xec_> g[r]eek: something like $("permanent parent selector").on("click", "my table cell selector", function(){...});
[05:26:12] <LekeFly> Suggestion on a drill down iphone menu plugin? or what i can use as search termes :p
[05:26:59] <xec_> "drill" sounds a bit suggestive to me
[05:27:14] <xec_> but if i understand you correctly, maybe look at jquery mobile?
[05:28:04] <LekeFly> xec_: Yeah something like that.. but i was hoping i would not need to use jquery mobile
[05:30:01] <xec_> i heard good things about sencha touch too, never tried it though
[05:31:05] <LekeFly> Was hoping to use something more lightweight :)
[05:31:52] <xec_> i can't imagine making big buttons would be too hard to do yourself
[05:32:00] <g[r]eek> xec_++
[05:32:04] <g[r]eek> works like a charm, thanks
[05:32:19] <xec_> yw :)
[05:34:48] <DuRa`> xec_: got the clue. the point was that with the mouseleave function, the ul was hidden again and the function tried to calculate the width of the hidden element. i just moved the each block after the show function and now it works.
[05:35:05] <DuRa`> thanks for your help though.
[05:35:39] <xec_> dammit, i was convinced i was on to something :D
[05:36:26] <xec_> glad you got it sorted :)
[05:36:58] <DuRa`> ye i tried to switch the selectors to match the first child, but i got always the same selector, then i logged the $(this) and saw it was hidden in firebug.
[05:50:01] <BaruchHashem> is there a jquery command that says onclick make sure that this class has this class applied to it.  If it already has the class applied to it then great, work is done etc

[06:24:10] <granden> I found the example about serialize on jquery api webpage
[06:24:17] <granden> but I dont really know how to do a few things
[06:24:26] <granden> how to make a complete url of my form
[06:25:21] <granden> http://pastebin.com/1K6KbZvA
[06:25:24] <granden> Got Like that
[06:25:33] <granden> but I would like to build a complete url with the domain and tld as well.
[06:25:46] <granden> And those with value="" should not show up at all.
[06:27:21] <qvarkk> a
[06:37:45] <granden> When using serialize on a form, can I tell it not to add a certain name and value if the value is ""?
[06:39:04] <Carlitta87_> could i right a query where, an item in a select (drop down) has a value of "other" a text box will appear.....even tho this field is dynamically credited...
[06:39:49] <error4o4> anyone has experience with JqueryUi DatePicker, onSelect event?  the parameter passed thorugh onSelect is in format  dd-mm-yyyy although dateFormat was set to   yyyy-mm-dd
[06:40:24] <Christer> Carlitta87_: yes, but as far as i have understood, you have to attach an event listener since the field is dynamically created and not a part of the orginal DOM.
[06:40:45] <Christer> or delegate or whatever that name of function was.
[06:40:54] <granden> http://agfoto.se/test.html
[06:41:00] <granden> I have done right that
[06:41:17] <granden> about that*
[06:41:27] <granden> but if you try it a bit
[06:41:36] <granden> for some values it becomes type=&
[06:41:42] <granden> if it dont have any values.
[06:44:27] <Christer> And what do you want it to do in that case?
[06:46:37] <Carlitta87_> as a beginner, could any recommend a site i can learn jquery from?....sometimes the internet seems very inconsistent...n its really bugging me -_-
[06:46:43] <qvarkk> I need to change one value in the form inputs ("action"), how can I do this? http://pastebin.com/3rWME8wm
[06:47:06] <Christer> Carlitta87_: http://www.learningjquery.com/category/levels/beginner
[06:48:39] <Christer> qvarkk: The paste is only the jquery script. you can just do .. $('#inputfieldID').val('value goes here');
[06:49:49] <qvarkk> Christer: alright. i can specifyt my question even more: what's the preferred way to replace/delete/update the value returned from $('#myform').serialize() ?
[06:51:05] <qvarkk> Christer: it's only a string i can see now

[06:58:07] <granden> Anyone?
[06:58:09] <JA|2> im trying in all
[06:59:31] <Woet> Carlitta87_: picking jquery instead of mootools on the left would be a good start
[06:59:58] <Woet> granden: what is wrong with empty GET paramaters?
[07:00:00] <Woet> parameters *
[07:00:52] <Carlitta87_> Woet : did that...nothing
[07:01:09] <Woet> Carlitta87_: then give me a link to a jsfiddle with the right framework
[07:01:17] <nFFF> Carlitta87
[07:01:18] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/T3Qyg/2/
[07:02:59] <Carlitta87_> nFFF it worked.... the way i wrote it, was it the old way?
[07:03:11] <nFFF> what?
[07:03:14] <Carlitta87_> Woet: nFFF version worked
[07:03:25] <nFFF> the way you wrote it was incorrect
[07:03:25] <Carlitta87_> nFFF : nvm
[07:03:30] <Carlitta87_> i need to practice more
[07:03:48] <nFFF> I can comment the changes
[07:04:55] <Lurzino> I have a little issue in this piece of code at http://pastebin.com/Zhfu4QJQ where i am trying to use zeroclipboard to copy to clipboard... anyone has a possible suggest since it doesn't work? Thanks...
[07:06:06] <Woet> ?demo @ Lurzino
[07:06:07] <bot-t> Lurzino, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:06:38] <Woet> Lurzino: further more, how exactly is ZeroClipboard related to jQuery?
[07:06:57] <nFFF> Carlitta87, http://jsfiddle.net/T3Qyg/4/
[07:09:11] <BrianH> Hey guys, anyone know of a good "mouse trail sparkle" script using jQuery?  I know it's very retro for the web, but I have a client who wants it.  I found several variations of the same one that puts + signs on the screen, but I'm looking for something with a lot more jazz.
[07:09:56] <foo> I want to have some flash file play in a pop-up lightbox (not in a new window, but lightbox within the page). Anyone know a way to do this with jquery? I am trying to find a code example
[07:11:08] <Horizons> RRRRAAAAAAAAHHHH.. freakin .change for <select> element is not playing fair.
[07:11:12] * Horizons *sigh*
[07:12:31] <Lurzino> (Lurzino) I have a little issue in this piece of code at http://pastebin.com/Zhfu4QJQ where i am trying to use zeroclipboard to copy to clipboard... anyone has a possible suggest since it doesn't work? Thanks...
[07:12:36] <Lurzino> Ops
[07:13:26] <Horizons> ok, if there is a .change linked to a select element and that said select is replaced with a select that has the same id... will that linkage be broken?
[07:13:48] <Lurzino> Woet, i am calling the zeroclipboard function from success function in ajax call which returns some data to paste in clipboard
[07:13:56] <guy> anyone familiar with http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/ ? is there a way to distinguish at_begining callback from what follows?
[07:14:03] <Woet> Lurzino: still missing the part where it's related to jQuery
[07:15:07] <granden> Woet: Want do make a cleaner url.
[07:15:22] <granden> Woet: Any idea on how?
[07:15:35] <gho5t> if the following data key is not set, shouldn't this return true? console.log(typeof el.data("blah") === undefined);
[07:15:41] <Woet> granden: well, you could use $("#form :input[value]").serialize()
[07:16:44] <remek> So I am learning javascript using jquery and ive run into a problem. (http://jsfiddle.net/BsYLJ/ - only part of code nothing close to working) In the code you'll see that I am animating the position of the wordList element, and when it moves I want to change the width of another element. but it needs to happen slightly before and as it is now it only sets the first width and then it does nothing but my console.log(width) tells me tha
[07:16:50] <remek> all the widths just super fast, what can i do?
[07:16:58] <granden> Woet: But wouldnt that just give me the values?
[07:17:02] <Woet> remek: picking jquery instead of mootools on the left of jsfiddle would be a good start
[07:17:05] <Woet> granden: no, try it.
[07:17:27] <gho5t> if the following data key is not set, shouldn't this return true? console.log(typeof el.data("blah") === undefined);
[07:17:39] <Woet> gho5t: asking your question once is more than enough, trust me.
[07:17:40] <remek> woet how would that help? I didnt even post all of my code, and i never posted it so you could run it. I just posted it so you could have an idea of what I was talking about
[07:17:53] <Woet> ?demo @ remek
[07:17:54] <bot-t> remek, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:18:04] <Woet> Lurzino: you should also read the docs of zero clipboard, "This library is fully compatible with Flash Player 10, which requires that the clipboard copy operation be initiated by a user click event inside the Flash movie."
[07:18:12] <Woet> Lurzino: so it requires a click event and will not work without one.
[07:18:44] <Woet> remek: so please post a _working_ demo.
[07:19:03] <guy> How do I call a function and pass "this" reference?
[07:19:23] <granden> Woet: Did try it, nothing at all happens
[07:20:00] <granden> http://agfoto.se/test.html
[07:20:04] <granden> It is like that
[07:20:25] <Woet> granden: you are using #form but there is nothing with the ID "form"
[07:20:34] <Woet> granden: please don't just copy my code but actually change it so it matches your use-case.
[07:20:50] <Horizons> well i guess the .change link to a select is broken when the select is recreated thus does not detect the opion select change.
[07:20:51] <remek> Woet http://jsfiddle.net/Cyh9m/ thats pretty much most of it stripped down to the problem. The problem as you see is that I have clearly now idea of how to change the width of the rotateContainer element so the whole words are shown and not cut off.
[07:20:52] * Horizons *sigh*
[07:21:01] <granden> Woet: Woops, thought it was as in form
[07:21:09] <granden> Then what id is that?
[07:21:12] <granden> id if?
[07:21:14] <granden> of*
[07:21:39] <Woet> granden: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[07:22:00] <Woet> remek: why do you want to set the width? why not just leave it away and let the browser decide?
[07:22:19] <remek> Woet because I was not able to make it do that.
[07:22:41] <naquad> http://jsfiddle.net/XBNAG/ - why isn't this working? docs say i can pass selector to next
[07:22:46] <granden> Woet: I dont get it.
[07:23:01] <Woet> granden: look at your previous code and the docs
[07:23:02] <quicksilver> naquad: you can, yes.
[07:23:05] <Woet> and read the docs *
[07:23:15] <naquad> quicksilver, but result is 0, it doesn't find anything
[07:23:18] <quicksilver> naquad: and the docs also explain that the selector just filters what the next element is.
[07:23:35] <quicksilver> naquad: so if the next element does not match ".info" you wil get zero elements
[07:23:36] <naquad> oh crap :( how do find following element by selector?
[07:23:41] <quicksilver> ?nextAll @ naquad
[07:23:41] <bot-t> naquad, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[07:23:51] <naquad> quicksilver, thank you!
[07:23:52] <remek> woet i cant even imagine how to get the ul container to adjust through css to the width of the a elements contained within when they are are not overflowing the main container
[07:26:35] <gho5t> guy: look into using "call"
[07:26:46] <guy> Found it already.
[07:26:59] <Horizons> lol... had to use <select onchange> attribute since the $(selector).change failed to relink after the select (dropdown) was destroyed and recreated.
[07:27:00] <gho5t> if the following data key is not set, shouldn't this return true? console.log(typeof el.data("blah") === undefined);
[07:27:31] <Tasser> what has been done when #resize fires? has the DOM already been ajusted?
[07:28:08] <quicksilver> Horizons: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_doesn.27t_an_event_work_on_a_new_element_I.27ve_created.3F ?
[07:29:58] <Horizons> quicksilver: the solution i'e done works just fine. but thx anyways, i'll take a look at it.
[07:30:10] <Horizons> quicksilver: the solution i've done works just fine. but thx anyways, i'll take a look at it.
[07:42:28] <Birliban> Hi, can someone help with data tables jquery plugin, i can't find a way to redraw the odd and even row colors after removing one row. fnDraw does not do tje job
[07:44:36] <smykes> anyone want to take a stab as to why this wouldnt work in IE7/IE8
[07:46:25] <xmaddness> absolutly not
[07:46:36] <smykes> lol

[07:56:50] <visof> hello
[07:57:33] <visof> how can i get the two elements after specific link with class="fields"
[07:57:49] <visof> i can get the link as $(link)
[07:58:12] <shoky> .next() ?
[07:58:19] <visof> how can i get the 2 elements after this link that have class="fields"
[07:58:24] <visof> shoky: how?
[07:58:39] <shoky> var n = $(link).next(), n2 = n.next()
[07:58:40] <visof> $(link).next(".fields") ?
[07:59:24] <shoky> the 2 elements need to have class=fields?
[07:59:42] <shoky> then yes.. var n = $(link).next('.fields'), n2 = n.next('.fields')
[08:00:52] <visof> shoky: i can't understand what closest() do
[08:00:58] <visof> can you explain it to me please
[08:01:15] <shoky> it looks at the ancestors of current node
[08:01:27] <shoky> looks at parent, then parent's parent, etc
[08:03:01] <visof> can you give me example please
[08:03:06] <Hypah> is it valid to set a $(div).resize(function () { }); ?
[08:04:22] <moussa> dhdhd
[08:04:26] <moussa> salu
[08:06:01] <shoky> visof: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vWGbG/
[08:06:56] <shoky> Hypah: yes
[08:09:13] <Hypah> the documentation suggests it only works on the window object
[08:11:15] <shoky> mm true
[08:11:38] <shoky> sorry. so no ;P
[08:12:45] <shoky> could swear i used it successfully in the past on a div ;SS

[08:20:14] <snover> 	r0mm23Ez
[08:20:29] <shoky> word
[08:22:49] <NodeX> anyone know if die() can work with namespacing ?
[08:23:33] <NodeX> the docs dont really talk about it
[08:24:21] <Carlitta87_> i have a dynamic form, i wanted to be able to do this. if the field in my form is a select (dropdown list ) oe checkbox list, when the text of the checked field is OTHER then a textbox will appear beside the field and deselect when it is unchecked. i was tols this would be rather different and i admit it is, i would appreciate any ideas u may have as to how to approach this. thanks in advance
[08:24:35] <johnkpaul> NodeX: I think you should try it and see
[08:24:40] <johnkpaul> in 1.7, it just delegates to .off
[08:24:45] <johnkpaul> and die is deprecated
[08:24:59] <johnkpaul> NodeX: it's supposed to take exactly the same parameters as live
[08:25:32] <Carlitta87_> i have a dynamic form, i wanted to be able to do this. if the field in my form is a select (dropdown list ) oe checkbox list, when the text of the checked field is OTHER then a textbox will appear beside the field and deselect when it is unchecked. i was tols this would be rather different and i admit it is, i would appreciate any ideas u may have as to how to approach this. thanks in advance
[08:26:05] <NodeX> my bad I thought die was the new way of doing things
[08:26:08] <NodeX> ?off
[08:26:09] <bot-t> NodeX, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[08:26:21] <mbtez> ?not
[08:26:22] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[08:26:32] <mbtez> hmm
[08:26:36] <NodeX> does off() work with live() ?
[08:26:43] <NodeX> (live in 1.7 is a wrapper proxy)
[08:26:50] <Cork[home]> NodeX: not really, it works like delegate
[08:27:11] <Cork[home]> but delegate can express the same thing as live, but with a different syntax
[08:27:12] <NodeX> dang
[08:27:13] <mbtez> ?selector
[08:27:13] <bot-t> mbtez, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:27:22] <Cork[home]> NodeX: check the delegate section in on
[08:27:43] <Cork[home]> NodeX: delegate tags a selector parameter, and if you bind it on document, it does the exact same thing live does
[08:27:50] <NodeX> live() wraps on and it's a littel better for me because it wraps a context
[08:27:52] <Cork[home]> *takes
[08:28:05] <NodeX> little*
[08:28:14] <Cork[home]> so does delegate
[08:28:25] <Cork[home]> ?.on
[08:28:26] <bot-t> Cork[home], .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:28:36] <Cork[home]> check the delegate section on that page
[08:28:46] <dabear> NodeX: sure it does: http://jsfiddle.net/YHYpb/2/
[08:28:47] <NodeX> they do the same thing lol
[08:28:53] <Dash__> how do i create a wiki account to edit http://docs.jquery.com/Alternative_Resources ?
[08:29:02] <mbtez> look all those selectors
[08:29:04] <NodeX> I dont need to go and change all my old code that uses live to use on
[08:29:14] <Cork[home]> NodeX: you do
[08:29:36] <Cork[home]> NodeX: live does $(selector).live; on does $(document).on('event', selector)
[08:29:39] <NodeX> no I dont lol not in 1.7
[08:29:45] <NodeX> it wraps on()
[08:29:55] <Cork[home]> yes, but it moves the selector input
[08:30:01] <Cork[home]> NodeX: live does $(selector).live; on does $(document).on('event', selector) <--
[08:30:12] <NodeX> exactly so my code is fine if it wraps it.. it's remapping for me
[08:30:43] <Cork[home]> NodeX: you should remove the old syntax anyway its missleading (thats why its depricated)
[08:31:08] <NodeX> No-1 else views my old syntax so I dont care about it
[08:31:33] <Cork[home]> NodeX: and on to of that its waistfull as it does a sizzle search through the dom and then doesn't use the found elements
[08:31:56] <Payton> Hello, I have a question about possibly using jQuery to cross fade text in ASP.Net.  I have a status bar div with an ASP.Net Label control on it that I set during an asynchronous postback.  I want to have the old text fade out and the new text fade in whenever I set the Text property of the label control.
[08:32:22] <NodeX> http://pastebin.com/NjiEu4ad <----- live wrapped
[08:32:32] <Cork[home]> Payton: if you want to crossfade you need too element
[08:32:58] <Payton> Cork[home] OK, that's easy enough to manage with two label controls.
[08:33:04] <NodeX> it re-arranges my live() call for me and calls on()... so it's the same as on() lol
[08:33:08] <Payton> Just toggle between them I would guess.
[08:33:10] <NodeX> (in the latest jquery anyway)
[08:33:31] <Cork[home]> NodeX: theres no need to do that for 1.7
[08:33:43] <Cork[home]> NodeX: live is still supported and its wrapped similarly to what your doing
[08:33:51] <Cork[home]> its 1.8 that dropps support
[08:34:11] <NodeX> 1.8 drops the live() wrapper?
[08:34:19] <Cork[home]> most likly
[08:34:32] <NodeX> not sure about that, it's 3 lines of code
[08:34:37] <Cork[home]> you normaly drop support for a depricated version at the next major version
[08:35:00] <Cork[home]> well its marked depricated
[08:35:08] <Cork[home]> depricated means its about to be removed
[08:36:39] <NodeX> ?on
[08:36:39] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:37:07] <NodeX> this is what is annoying about on()... it's backward to live() with it's layout
[08:37:17] <dabear> Cork[home]: it has happened before that deprecated stuff in jquery has become undeprecated
[08:37:26] <dabear> $.browser is a good example
[08:37:46] <NodeX> or live is backward w/e
[08:37:58] <Cork[home]> true, but browser has a place to fill
[08:38:13] <Cork[home]> when you need to build workarounds for bugs in broken browser versions
[08:38:22] <Cork[home]> live is... just broken
[08:38:26] <ajpiano> dabear: we are removing $.browser...
[08:38:34] <smykes> im still using live
[08:38:39] <smykes> i probably shouldnt be
[08:38:45] <Cork[home]> smykes: true :)
[08:39:14] <NodeX> ?off
[08:39:15] <bot-t> NodeX, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[08:39:28] <dabear> ajpiano: really? maybe you should re-deprecate it then..
[08:39:40] <dabear> "frowned upon" != deprecated
[08:40:01] <shoky> it's deprecated
[08:40:32] <Cork[home]> dabear: "Categories: Deprecated "
[08:40:36] <Payton> Cork[home] How do I go about doing the fade out of the old element and the fade in of the new element?
[08:40:36] <Cork[home]> :x
[08:40:46] <dabear> Cork[home]: nope, not in source
[08:40:49] <smykes> does depreciated mean it will stop working some day
[08:40:55] <Cork[home]> dabear: but in docs
[08:41:01] <dabear> source is king
[08:41:09] <shoky> smykes: it means probably, yes
[08:41:10] <Cork[home]> Payton: do you want the text to cross fade?
[08:41:10] <ajpiano> smykes: it means it will eventually be removed and continuing to use it is not favoured compared to other methods
[08:41:33] <smykes> ajpiano will i still be working for this company when it is removed?
[08:41:48] <Payton> Probably be best if the old text fades out then the new text fades in.
[08:41:49] <tehOPEologist> hey all, i'm trying to change the src of an <img> inside a div when the div is clicked..  anyone have any documentation on how to do that?
[08:42:04] <Cork[home]> Payton: then you don't need two labels
[08:42:22] <smykes> tehOPEologist did you try attr.("src", "/foo");
[08:42:36] <ajpiano> dabear: that's not true that "source is king" for marked as deprecation
[08:42:41] <smykes> err .attr()
[08:42:44] <Cork[home]> Payton: just do elm.fadeOut('slow', function() { elm.html(text):fadeIn('slow') });
[08:42:50] <tehOPEologist> was thinking of that..  do i just need to use ('img').on({
[08:42:50] <tehOPEologist> ?
[08:42:51] <Cork[home]> bah
[08:43:02] <Payton> Cork[home], Thanks, will try that.
[08:43:03] <Cork[home]> Payton: ).fadeIn not :fadeIn
[08:43:04] <dabear> ajpiano: mark it as deprecated in the source at least..
[08:43:08] <ajpiano> file a bug
[08:43:36] <dabear> hah, seriously?
[08:43:45] <ajpiano> if you think it's important :)
[08:44:13] <NodeX> end of a very long day ... am I missing something silly here ? http://jsfiddle.net/JAzVY/
[08:44:23] <NodeX> the unbind never happenes
[08:44:26] <NodeX> happens*
[08:44:52] <Cork[home]> NodeX: you don't need the {}, in there
[08:44:53] <ajpiano> NodeX: is the request successful?
[08:44:59] <NodeX> yes and I know
[08:45:17] <NodeX> Eventualy somehting will be there
[08:45:22] <NodeX> yes to the request
[08:45:29] <Cork[home]> looks fine other then that
[08:45:48] <shoky> isn't it because he's binding on 'body'
[08:45:51] <NodeX> that's what I thought
[08:46:00] <Cork[home]> shoky: nope thats fine
[08:46:32] <NodeX> there is another on() bound .. it's namespaced to hover.ratings
[08:46:39] <NodeX> maybe that is playing with it ?
[08:46:48] <Cork[home]> shouldn't be
[08:47:07] <Cork[home]> wait a min
[08:47:15] <Cork[home]> what are you trying to kill with element.off=
[08:47:17] <Cork[home]> *?
[08:47:26] <NodeX> the on()
[08:47:40] <Cork[home]> then you need to do it in $('body')
[08:47:45] <Cork[home]> not element
[08:47:47] <NodeX> dang
[08:48:01] <ajpiano> NodeX: do you just want to stop *that element* from responding to the body.on chandler?
[08:48:10] <ajpiano> or *every* .rate element to stop responding
[08:48:23] <shoky> see: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JAzVY/1/
[08:48:28] <NodeX> $("body").off('.rate');
[08:48:31] <NodeX> something like that?
[08:48:49] <ajpiano> NodeX: answer th question directly
[08:48:54] <ajpiano> then i can know what has to be done
[08:49:01] <ajpiano> do you want to stop all elements, or just the one that was clicked
[08:49:02] <NodeX> ajpiano : once a rate has taken place I want to unbind hover and click
[08:49:15] <sunbeam> Does anyone know if there are plans for IE to solve the buggy implementation of font-face?
[08:49:15] <NodeX> On the element I set it up on
[08:49:22] <Cork[home]> ok so just that element
[08:49:26] <Cork[home]> not all elements
[08:49:29] <ajpiano> NodeX: you probably have to bind a new handler to $(this)
[08:49:29] <NodeX> no
[08:49:45] <Cork[home]> <_<'
[08:49:51] <NodeX> why does on() have to be so complicated for this
[08:49:58] <NodeX> live does it so easily
[08:50:03] <tehOPEologist> smykes: tried ('img').attr, but it changed all the img's on the page to the one i specified..  any way to segregate just that one img tag in that div i clicked?
[08:50:09] <NodeX> you bind then you die() when you dont want it
[08:50:37] <Cork[home]> NodeX: if you bind multibe live listners it will trigger on all similar elements
[08:50:45] <Cork[home]> NodeX: its the exact same solution
[08:51:08] <Cork[home]> NodeX: the difference is that live has a syntax that lies about what element it works on
[08:51:23] <NodeX> great. so I have to pass a context to the off() ?
[08:51:27] <Cork[home]> NodeX:  $("body").off('click.ratings','.rate') will kill that listner
[08:51:31] <ajpiano> NodeX: with .live and .die, you have the exact same thing... you have to .die on the elem you called .live on... same for .on/.off
[08:51:31] <JA|2> hi
[08:51:36] <shoky> hy
[08:51:37] <ajpiano> anyway i gotta go
[08:51:50] <shoky> byez~
[08:52:23] <NodeX> thanks cork, ajpiano
[08:52:48] <Cork[home]> NodeX: and if you want to kill hover and click on that selector $("body").off('click hover','.rate');
[08:53:17] <Cork[home]> NodeX: thats what live actually does, it never uses the element you provide it
[08:53:20] <NodeX> I found it easier to set a variable in the end but it's good to know how to do it
[08:53:20] <JA|2> off to work
[08:53:21] <JA|2> bye
[08:53:24] <JA|2> :0
[08:53:37] <NodeX> if() { return } ... saves initialising again anyway
[09:00:26] <visof> hello
[09:01:41] <visof> i downloaded jquery.1.7.2 and imported it in html file and i checked that using firebug and try to run some functions at external file.js and imported it and i got $ is undefined
[09:01:54] <visof> and when i try the expression at console it works fine
[09:02:05] <visof> can anyone help me please
[09:03:08] <johnkpaul> switch $ to jQuery, visof and see if you have issues
[09:03:57] <visof> johnkpaul: what do you mean ?
[09:04:43] <smykes> man its only tuesday
[09:05:16] <johnkpaul> replace the character $ jQuery
[09:05:52] <shoky> with*
[09:07:22] <visof> johnkpaul: $("#left").hide(); to jQuery("#left").hide(); ?
[09:07:26] <Payton> Cork[home] Thanks a bunch, got it working the way I want.
[09:07:38] <johnkpaul> visof: yes
[09:08:37] <visof> johnkpaul: i got Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[09:09:22] <johnkpaul> visof: are you sure that the script tag that includes jquery is above the script tag that includes your javascript?
[09:09:40] <shoky> visof, pastebin your html
[09:09:54] <shoky> and the code generating the error
[09:10:03] <shoky> sup johnkpaul
[09:10:28] <johnkpaul> hey shoky, how's it going
[09:10:59] <shoky> oks. stupid country.. soon there will be sirens in the whole country
[09:11:57] <shoky> so we are all forced to remember the fallen, in one concentrated minute
[09:12:24] <shoky> sorry. </rant>
[09:13:13] <sunbeam> Cufon.now() function removed from cufon yui?
[09:14:19] <johnkpaul> shoky: ? what country?
[09:14:25] <shoky> israel
[09:14:37] <shoky> its memorial day tomorrow
[09:14:39] <johnkpaul> holocaust memorial day is today?
[09:14:42] <johnkpaul> I thought it was a week ago?
[09:14:48] <shoky> yeah that was a week ago
[09:14:57] <johnkpaul> oh, memorial day has the same ceremony?
[09:15:01] <johnkpaul> I have a lot of Israeli coworkers
[09:15:10] <shoky> tomorrow's memorial for fallen soldiers etc..
[09:15:19] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[09:15:21] <shoky> last week it was only one siren in the morning
[09:15:29] <shoky> this week its one tonight and one tomorrow morning
[09:15:30] <shoky> feh
[09:15:49] <johnkpaul> I didn't realize it was sirens
[09:15:53] <johnkpaul> I thought it was just a moment of silence
[09:15:55] <shoky> yeah :\
[09:16:04] <shoky> they are fucken scary
[09:16:12] <shoky> never got used to em
[09:16:47] <Whirl3d> good morning all.
[09:16:55] <shoky> 'morn
[09:17:37] <shoky> and then tomorrow evening everyone stops grieving and it's suddenly independence day
[09:17:48] <shoky> absurd stuff
[09:18:44] * Whirl3d is reading back to see what the topic is at hand
[09:18:55] <shoky> me ranting mostly
[09:18:57] <johnkpaul> there really are a lot of country holidays at this time, I hadn't known of holocaust memorial day until last week
[09:19:04] <sunbeam> how come cufon doesn't work on IE6,7 ?
[09:19:20] <sunbeam> it works, but doesn't remove the non cufon font
[09:19:21] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: it should
[09:19:29] <sphinxxx> pretty cool : gzipwtf.com
[09:19:48] <sunbeam> i normally would use font-face, but its rending of IE is too inconsistent to have an exact proper resultr
[09:19:53] <johnkpaul> aw sphinxxx I aree that's cool, but I was hoping for something different
[09:19:55] <sunbeam> rendering*
[09:20:17] <sphinxxx> (checks for gzip and site speed on resources)
[09:20:19] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: have you tried the cufon forums?
[09:20:38] <johnkpaul> yeah, sphinxxx, I want something that will allow you to put in a few differnet hand minified versions of third party scripts
[09:20:50] <johnkpaul> and tells you which one gzipps the smallest
[09:20:57] <sphinxxx> yea that would be nice
[09:21:01] <johnkpaul> I stated working on one
[09:21:08] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/johnkpaul/comparejs
[09:21:12] <sphinxxx> i still find this useful though, compared to checking stuff through an inspector
[09:21:13] <johnkpaul> a few weeks ago
[09:21:24] <johnkpaul> yeah, definitely, I've bookmarked it
[09:21:29] <johnkpaul> but I need to just take the time to build what I want
[09:21:59] <smykes> ajpiano have you ever seen this?  SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.
[09:22:05] <Whirl3d> I have an array of technical terms that I need to replace with links/images--stored in objects like {source:thesourcestring, replace:thereplacementhtml}, the replacement html, however, has img tags in it. So I want to preload the img, on success do the replacement, on fail, skip it. Any suggestions before I get knee deep?
[09:22:40] <johnkpaul> suggestions for what, Whirl3d, how to preload the img?
[09:22:54] <johnkpaul> ?g javascript image constructor preloading
[09:22:56] <bot-t> johnkpaul, browser - How does the javascript preloading work? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/860910/how-does-the-javascript-preloading-work
[09:23:39] <Whirl3d> How to approach the entire thing. I was going to use $.each on the array, search the text for the source, then, if found, preload the image and return a promise that would do the replacement or not..
[09:25:05] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: this is static text, not to be updated at all?
[09:25:39] <Whirl3d> from the user's perspective yes. The client, however, will be adding these technical references as she goes
[09:25:51] <Whirl3d> so, the source orf the replacement data will change over time.
[09:25:54] <shoky> success/fail of what?
[09:25:55] <shoky> ajax?
[09:25:58] <johnkpaul> I think that's a fine approach, it might also be a situation to consider an more modular solution
[09:26:15] <johnkpaul> perhaps looking into one of the million javascript mvwhatever frameworks
[09:26:37] <Whirl3d> success/fail of the image  load. She is not the most technically efficient and I don't wan the links to show up with blank images...
[09:27:02] <shoky> o
[09:27:23] <shoky> so yeah seems like a fine approach
[09:28:23] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, shoky, thanks for the replies. I will spend some time to learn a mvc framework one day, but for now, I feel more comfortable kludging the pieces togther manually. LOL
[09:28:40] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: it's not actually much to "learn"
[09:29:12] <Whirl3d> I figure besides the entire paradigm of mvc, I'd have to learn a new api or two
[09:29:32] <johnkpaul> oh, mvc yes, the api or two will take you half an hour
[09:30:20] <Whirl3d> I've tried the mvc paradigm before and it just seems like such unapologetic bs. I mean, I know it works and it's great, but it just seems like logical beauracracy to me.
[09:30:53] <Whirl3d> So, I know I need to get over that
[09:31:00] <visof> how can i get elements with display:none in div ?
[09:31:54] <shoky> ?hidden @ visof
[09:31:55] <bot-t> visof, :hidden: Selects all elements that are hidden. http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[09:33:17] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: logical beaurocracy?
[09:33:38] <johnkpaul> I definitely don't think it's always a good tool to apply, but I think it's useful for modularity and code reuse
[09:33:43] <johnkpaul> but sometimes it requires more effort than it's worth
[09:33:46] <Carlitta87_> how can i append beside an object?
[09:35:09] <illoomn8> anyone familiar with shadowbox per chance? having trouble reseting form values that are opened in a shadowbox
[09:38:00] <Whirl3d> Yeah, you know. Paperwork....I mean, I understand the concept and I have tried to embrace it with an open mind, but it just seems like a lot of extra work and a ton of extra code for something as simple as a slideshow for example. I see the advantages, but man, it's a lot of work for a simple-basic website that technically could be presented in one html with no javascript
[09:38:13] <Whirl3d> *one html document
[09:38:48] <smykes> I wish IE had better debugging tools
[09:38:49] <smykes> POS
[09:39:41] <panzi> is there a shorter way to write this (maybe as a single expression): var $element = $(element); if (!$element.is(selector)) $element = $element.parents(selector).first();
[09:40:23] <ThiefMaster> yes, remove the $ - it saves you 4 characters :p
[09:40:33] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: do you remember a time when creating a new function was extra work?
[09:40:35] <panzi> smykes: we all wish this or that someone invents a time machine and prevents IE from ever be written
[09:40:47] <johnkpaul> and when it was _so_ much easier just to write all of your code in a gigantic document.ready handler?
[09:40:59] <shoky> Whirl3d what would you base the promise result on?
[09:41:05] <shoky> just curious
[09:41:12] <Whirl3d> trust me. Creating a new function is still extra work. LOL Just kidding.
[09:41:23] <johnkpaul> :) but you know what I mean, right?
[09:41:32] <johnkpaul> looking back, I rememeber that shift requiring thought, and now it does no longer
[09:41:34] <smykes> panzi are you working on said time machine?
[09:42:49] <shoky> oh onload, silly me
[09:43:11] <illoomn8> $("#sb-content :text").val("");   trying to select all input type="text" within #sb-content, can anyone help me?
[09:43:54] <panzi> smykes: I'd need two black holes orbiting each other. and a spaceship to get there. but then if I'd had such a spaceship I'd be just gone, cruising the galaxy
[09:44:19] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I hear ya and I agree. But I have a terrible case of ADHD or whatever they want to call it nowadays and without a lot of constraints or requirements, I spin helpless out of control and never get anything accomplished. LIke this site, for example, I have been working on for months and you could have done it in your sleep last night.
[09:44:58] <JAAulde> Squirrel!
[09:45:10] * JAAulde watches Whirl3d's head spin
[09:45:25] <Whirl3d> But just before I get ready to wrap it up, something new comes along that I just have to try. Next thing you know, I'm back at square one. And though MVC promises to solve that issue, there have been dozens of other paradigms (jquery included) that have offered the same poison apple.
[09:45:50] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: well, that last part might be because you're not getting paid to move on :)
[09:45:53] <Horizons> Shinny Ball!
[09:45:59] <Whirl3d> True there.
[09:46:02] <johnkpaul> I know what you mean, we all have that tendency, it's why we decided to become engineers IMHO
[09:46:25] <johnkpaul> although I don't think that jquery is a paradigm, sometimes I do wish that it gave more guidance as to structure
[09:46:35] <Horizons> Thats why i turned to pot. help with th ADD lol
[09:46:37] <johnkpaul> because of jquery spaghetti hell that we've all dealth with
[09:46:43] <smykes> I AM NOT AN ENGINEER --- I have social skills....
[09:46:44] <johnkpaul> haha
[09:46:45] <Whirl3d> After 3 years of EE with a 3.8 gpa at CSU, the Dean of the College of Engineering told me to get out of engineering. LOL
[09:46:58] <johnkpaul> whatever, programmer, coder, doesn't matter
[09:47:09] <smykes> I AM AN ARTIST ROFL
[09:47:33] <Horizons> build a bridge only to never finish it due to ADD.
[09:47:45] <JAAulde> Whirl3d: I was the exact same way, and still am in a lot of ways--esp my personal work. My current job has been really good at teaching me to work iteratively.  Get SOMETHING done and working and make money on it, and come back to it as many times as _necessary_ to refine or rework. "Necessary" being a key word
[09:47:51] <smykes> get some stimulants they fix my adhd
[09:47:51] <Whirl3d> And you are 100% right. Getting paid to do something or having a job with peers that can help/critique/compete with also helps a lot.
[09:48:13] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so this is something built for recreation?
[09:48:15] <johnkpaul> or pro bono?
[09:48:25] <smykes> you said bono
[09:48:37] <Whirl3d> pro bono. I'm using it as a platform to explore jquery, really.
[09:48:49] <smykes> Whirl3d if you have adhd dexadrine is a wonderful drug
[09:49:18] <Horizons> Yea, it's that pay check that forces you to stay on task. Even if you get bored with the project. Kinda sucks, but its well worth it in the end.
[09:49:22] <Whirl3d> <--adderral, provigil daily
[09:49:39] <smykes> dexadrine is great because its spantial
[09:49:43] <smykes> you only take it once
[09:49:49] <smykes> so you cant forget to take it at lunch
[09:50:18] <Whirl3d> Horizon, I agree.  I've been thiniking about going back to school or something lately.
[09:50:32] <smykes> meh school
[09:50:40] <smykes> who actually does what there degree is in
[09:51:25] <Horizons> Over the 15 years i've been on the internet.. I've learned more then i would EVER learn from a school/collage book
[09:51:33] * JAAulde has no degree
[09:51:44] <smykes> except for spelling college
[09:51:49] <Horizons> Real World Experience is the best
[09:51:51] <shoky> academia has its place
[09:51:55] <shoky> and it should stay there ;D
[09:52:37] <JAAulde> I firmly believe academia has it's place and can be beneficial. What really bothers me is that so many people find academia to be a primary factor.
[09:52:47] <JAAulde> that goes for any field
[09:52:55] <Horizons> its the internet.. proper spelling, grammer are a dying art.
[09:52:58] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: don't go back to school
[09:53:15] <johnkpaul> I have no cs degree, and no one questions it
[09:53:16] <Whirl3d> Not for the degree, for something to do.
[09:53:18] <smykes> I wonder if i can con my company into sending me to Event Apart
[09:53:29] <johnkpaul> oh, if you want something to do, start takig those coursera/stanford online calsses
[09:53:31] <johnkpaul> because they are aweosme
[09:53:37] <johnkpaul> and really interesting ways to spend your down time
[09:53:40] <johnkpaul> IMHO
[09:53:42] <smykes> Whirl3d get a gf all your time will be taken up immediately
[09:53:45] <Whirl3d> I was looking at those recently
[09:53:51] <JAAulde> I've been working on a business degree just to help me understand some things I'd like to know about for being self employed. I don't think I could tolerate working on any sort of technical degree at this point in my life.
[09:53:54] <Horizons> smykes: if its to help better you at your current job then i don't see why not
[09:54:02] <smykes> Whirl3d MIT has them too
[09:54:27] <johnkpaul> yeah, MIT's new ones are good, they have a lot of old stuff that isn't as so thorough
[09:54:27] <smykes> Horizons because they are cheap
[09:54:38] <johnkpaul> so does yale, and there is a whole section on itunes called itunes univerisyt
[09:54:54] <Horizons> smykes: that sucks
[09:55:00] * JAAulde is 33 yrs old, married, 4 kids, 1 foster placement, no degree. Been web developing professionally for ~ 6 years
[09:55:16] <smykes> free lancing is scary
[09:55:32] <Horizons> smykes: not really.. i do it all the tie.
[09:55:35] <Horizons> time*
[09:55:41] <smykes> it is if it's your only source of income
[09:55:45] <johnkpaul> it depends on your temperment
[09:56:08] <johnkpaul> and how risk averse you are
[09:56:25] <Horizons> Yea.. you always have to be polite and listen to the contractee.
[09:56:25] <smykes> ugh $("#criteria" + RuleSequenceNo) no problem in FF or IE 9, IE 7 and IE 8 choke
[09:56:25] <shoky> i just couldn't handle dealing with the clients
[09:56:30] <shoky> new boss every month, yuck
[09:56:53] <Horizons> Any deviation from the plan of the project could cause you to lose that client
[09:57:03] <Horizons> loose*
[09:57:09] * Whirl3d is 42 years old been working with computers since 1980
[09:57:19] <smykes> i was born in 1980 rofl
[09:57:22] <Horizons> <- '96
[09:57:35] <shoky> hm.
[09:57:41] <Whirl3d> you whippersnappers...
[09:57:44] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:57:44] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  What was Dos like, was it dreamy
[09:57:45] <JAAulde> Horizons: I graduated HS in '96
[09:57:46] <smykes> OLD YOU ARE
[09:57:57] <shoky> dos was groovy
[09:58:02] <StevenCodes> hells yeah
[09:58:06] <Whirl3d> Assembly was groovy.
[09:58:08] <smykes> Horizons shouldnt you bein in High School right now?
[09:58:08] <StevenCodes> i can get jiggy with that
[09:58:12] <shoky> assembly still is
[09:58:17] <StevenCodes> NASM <3
[09:58:20] <StevenCodes> tasm
[09:58:21] <Horizons> started on Dos 6.22 :) in 96 building a Dial up BBS
[09:58:25] <Whirl3d> In sixth greade I wrote my first assembly code and sold it to Remax Central for about 25,000
[09:58:27] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:58:27] <Horizons> and learning Basic 4.5
[09:58:36] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  You dawg
[09:58:37] <Horizons> Qbasic that is.
[09:58:47] <shoky> gwbasic ftw
[09:58:58] <smykes> in sixth grade imasturbated at any free moment and didn't sell it to anyone
[09:59:13] <Whirl3d> that was last year, though, right?
[09:59:17] <Horizons> o.O
[09:59:49] <shoky> gah. sirens any second now
[09:59:56] <smykes> but i was an athlete at that age
[10:00:17] <smykes> ok i have to figure out this problem
[10:00:20] <smykes> TOO DISTRACTING
[10:00:43] <Whirl3d> Guess it's inappropriate to turn up Azalia Banks in the 212 during the sirens, huh?
[10:01:29] <shoky> damn that was loud
[10:03:34] <shoky> what's Azalia Banks in the 212 ?
[10:04:05] <JAAulde> brb: $('#JAAulde').find('systems > digestive.lower').empty();
[10:04:22] <Whirl3d> My new favorite performer. She's a rapper from new york and she is really amazing/confrontational/talented.
[10:04:41] <Whirl3d> JAAulde, ewww
[10:04:50] <shoky> ahhh rap
[10:04:59] <shoky> no that would definitely not be appropriate ;)
[10:05:13] <Whirl3d> She's particularly confrontational, that's why I mentioned her
[10:05:18] <shoky> heh
[10:05:29] <mnemoc> nice, finally google drive!
[10:05:36] <Whirl3d> I was trying to match your sentiments from earlier.
[10:06:00] <shoky> much appreciated
[10:07:35] <Whirl3d> mnemoc, hasn't google drive been around forever?
[10:08:34] <Whirl3d> Oh, Google's own Google Drive (I've been using a browser extension called google drive that did the same thing)
[10:10:23] <mnemoc> Whirl3d: and with SDK :)
[10:10:42] <JAAulde> back. my system call returned true.
[10:11:11] <JAAulde> flipin' Google drive. welcome to 2002 Google
[10:11:15] <JAAulde> online storage, WOW!
[10:11:33] <shoky> ;]
[10:11:46] <mnemoc> JAAulde: it's about the $$ :p .... dropbox and box are awfully overpriced
[10:11:49] <JAAulde> of course this is better, it clouds and all
[10:11:51] <Carlitta87_> how can i use eq to get the value of a checkbox?
[10:12:11] <Carlitta87_> ive been researching but too many inconsistencies
[10:12:21] <shoky> what do you mean
[10:12:25] <JAAulde> mnemoc: that's fine, but let's not media blitz it like it's some hot new thing
[10:12:48] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: .eq() doesn't get the value of enayting.  do elaborate...
[10:13:04] <JAAulde> s/enayting/anything/
[10:13:08] <mnemoc> JAAulde: like with G+, they are joining late... but still better late than never
[10:13:22] <JAAulde> omg, G+, another big floppin wow
[10:13:29] <mnemoc> :)
[10:13:32] <JAAulde> :P
[10:14:22] <Carlitta87_> JAAulde: im trying to get value from a checkbox (i.e the text the comes after the box) then if it equals a particular word it wud do sumthing
[10:15:00] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: ok 1) the text which follows a check box is not it's value. 2) eq() will not do compariosons of strings like that
[10:15:07] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: It would help to see your DOM structure
[10:16:29] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I would be glad to investigate an mvc platform based on your suggestion if you know of a good starting point.
[10:17:13] <sunbeam> how come cufon doesn't work properly on IE6,7? the original font is still in the background
[10:18:15] <snover> because welcome to 2012, it’s time to use @font-face
[10:18:17] <tehOPEologist> sup all, i have some code i want to apply to different divs when someone clicks on that specific div..  is there a way to make the code dynamic so i don't have to hard-code it to each div?
[10:18:28] <tehOPEologist> i can post a pastebin or something if you want to see what i'm doing
[10:18:30] <snover> also stop supporting ie6
[10:19:21] <nFFF> http://www.mrporter.com/journal/journal_issue61/3?cm_sp=homepage-_-thelook-_-240412#1
[10:19:27] <nFFF> what fuarking live site uses alerts
[10:19:35] <nFFF> when your suppose to be a 100mil company
[10:19:49] <Carlitta87_> JAAulde : http://jsfiddle.net/mB8mw/1/ it doesnt run but i wanted u to get the idea of it...i hope im not confusing u
[10:21:01] <tehOPEologist> could anyone assist me?
[10:21:31] <JAAulde> tehOPEologist: don's ask to ask.  ask. post your stuff, ask your wuestion
[10:21:37] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: looking...
[10:21:38] <tehOPEologist> i did above ^
[10:22:01] <tehOPEologist> sup all, i have some code i want to apply to different divs when someone clicks on that specific div..  is there a way to make the code dynamic so i don't have to hard-code it to each div?
[10:22:02] <JAAulde> then wait. :)
[10:22:06] <tehOPEologist> mkay, just didn't know :3
[10:22:07] <tehOPEologist> <3
[10:23:19] <Carlitta87_> tehOPEologist: http://www.electrictoolbox.com/jquery-find-index-element-clicked/
[10:24:02] <tehOPEologist> thanks, i'll take a look at that
[10:24:03] <tehOPEologist> :3
[10:24:03] <sunbeam> snover: yea right
[10:24:09] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: ok, it will be tricky because you'll need to use .text() to read the value next to the checkbox, but you aren't encapsulating your input's or the associated text
[10:24:16] <snover> sunbeam: yea right what?
[10:24:23] <sunbeam> snover: you never designed anything?
[10:24:25] <mike817> anyone use the validate plugin? i'm trying to find a a way to make a field required, but not show a message
[10:24:28] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: would be be able to add a LABEL element or a parent wrapper to each input/text?
[10:24:32] <sunbeam> snover: its not that font-face is consistently rendered in IE
[10:24:47] <snover> sunbeam: ???
[10:25:09] <sunbeam> different weight, padding, negative margin etc
[10:25:12] <JAAulde> tehOPEologist: It would def help me to see your code pastebinned if you're still needing help
[10:25:26] <snover> sunbeam: what are you talking about
[10:25:26] <tehOPEologist> sure, one sec
[10:25:39] <sunbeam> snover: do you understand english?
[10:25:47] <sunbeam> snover: if you think conditional IE hacks are nice use, sure
[10:25:50] <snover> sunbeam: I understand english when people are actually being coherent
[10:25:55] <sunbeam> then font-face is the solution
[10:26:01] <tehOPEologist> JAAulde: http://pastebin.com/hqGhCT9V
[10:26:12] <snover> sunbeam: @font-face is supported by every single browser
[10:26:16] <sunbeam> doh
[10:26:20] <snover> supported in IE since 5.5
[10:26:21] <sunbeam> but it's interpreted differently
[10:26:24] <snover> no
[10:26:44] <snover> IE<9 uses EOTs, everyone else uses WOFF, but other than that, there is no difference
[10:26:52] <sunbeam> There is
[10:27:06] <sunbeam> wait, i'll make an example if you like
[10:27:42] <snover> there is a far greater difference in font rendering across operating systems than there is between browsers
[10:27:48] <snover> but i am not going to argue with you
[10:27:56] <Carlitta87_> JAAulde : i actually did....
[10:28:01] <snover> if you want to be stuck in the middle part of last decade, go for it
[10:28:21] <snover> I really have absolutely no stake in your code
[10:28:24] <snover> or the outcome
[10:28:33] <snover> so if you don’t want to listen to my experience that is fine
[10:28:38] <sunbeam> well, i know font face is the best practice
[10:28:49] <sunbeam> but if you need a proper navigation design like it is in a design
[10:28:53] <sunbeam> then it's not the best practice
[10:28:59] <snover> yes it is.
[10:29:02] <sunbeam> because you have to agree with some difference in view
[10:29:11] <shoky> Carlitta87: .val() of the checkbox will get you the 'value' attribute... e.g. 101 or 102
[10:29:23] <snover> sunbeam: http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/
[10:29:50] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: not in the Fiddle you sent me
[10:30:00] <sunbeam> But a negative margin of 30 pixels? No, that's not acceptable in any design
[10:30:13] <sunbeam> But a negative margin of 30 pixels? <- on a font baseline that is
[10:30:54] <Carlitta87_> JAAulde : http://jsfiddle.net/mB8mw/2/
[10:30:57] <Carlitta87_> i updated it
[10:31:06] <snover> sunbeam: I have no idea what you are talking about
[10:31:11] <sunbeam> I'm not going to argue that cufon is an outdated technique, because yes; it is
[10:31:13] <snover> sunbeam: if your font metrics are wrong, fix your font metrics.
[10:31:21] <snover> hell, font squirrel automatically fixes them for you.
[10:31:34] <sunbeam> I always use font squirrel
[10:32:29] <snover> then check the “fix vertical metrics” box
[10:32:37] <sunbeam> ok lets try it
[10:33:41] <shoky> Carlitta87 maybe this helps? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mB8mw/4/
[10:38:05] <tehOPEologist> JAAulde, so i'm trying to apply that concept to my functions i'm trying to run and it's not really working..  i'm thinking i'm not calling the index properly after i established the variable..  any help?  http://pastebin.com/b0du9WTV
[10:39:32] <shoky> tehOPEologist: that var index is only local to the function you declared it in
[10:39:52] <tehOPEologist> so i should put my other functions right after the var, right?
[10:40:16] <shoky> not really sure what you're trying to do
[10:40:18] <shoky> with .index()
[10:40:32] <tehOPEologist> basically segregate these indexes so i can apply different things to them
[10:40:47] <shoky> index is a number, yes?
[10:40:52] <tehOPEologist> like when you click on a div, another static div will change content in it based off the specific div you clicked
[10:40:58] <shoky> $(index).click  doesn't make sense
[10:41:31] <tehOPEologist> well could i do #mtt_content_area index?
[10:41:46] <tehOPEologist> (that id is the main div with all the other divs
[10:41:47] <tehOPEologist> )
[10:41:48] <shoky> still no clue what you're using index for
[10:42:34] <shoky> what do you think an index is..?
[10:42:43] <tehOPEologist> i'm basially trying to not hard code these functions for each div i have on this page.. have about 22 different divs that need to do similiar things, but independently
[10:42:51] <tehOPEologist> no, i understand what it is now
[10:42:59] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: http://jsfiddle.net/mB8mw/5/
[10:43:15] <JAAulde> Carlitta87_: that is not a solution, but shows you how to get the text given your current DOM structure
[10:43:26] <shoky> tehOPEologist you definitely dont need to hard code it for each of the 22 divs
[10:43:57] <tehOPEologist> yeah, i'm just trying to make it dynamic so it does the same stuff for each div you click
[10:44:01] <tehOPEologist> http://dev.simsol.com/wordpress/meet-the-team
[10:44:06] <tehOPEologist> this is the page i'm working on
[10:44:30] <tehOPEologist> when you click on a div for an employee, the bg of the person's avatar changes to green, and the photo changes
[10:44:50] <tehOPEologist> and the big div on the top right will change to text that is a brief description of the employee
[10:45:43] <shoky> something like this? http://pastebin.com/S1frGLiq
[10:46:10] <tehOPEologist> yes
[10:46:18] <tehOPEologist> refresh the page and click on the top left one
[10:46:25] <tehOPEologist> it needs to do that
[10:46:35] <shoky> ;]
[10:46:57] <shoky> so you're set?
[10:46:58] <tehOPEologist> BUT i need to figure out a way to make them independent of one another so i can apply the text divs to them as well
[10:47:09] <shoky> they're already independent
[10:47:15] <tehOPEologist> sort of..  but again, i was hoping i could make the code clean enough so i don't hardcode it all..
[10:47:26] <tehOPEologist> *dynamic enough
[10:47:35] <JAAulde> sorry gang, gotta run.  medical emergency with my kid at school
[10:47:43] <shoky> good luck
[10:47:51] <tehOPEologist> have the code know which div is clicked and run the code for that specific one
[10:48:04] <shoky> tehOPEologist it is already doing that.........
[10:48:48] <shoky> 'this' refers to the div that was clicked on
[10:49:16] <tehOPEologist> i know, but the way i did the css to make it look like that is a mix of id's and classes
[10:49:25] <tehOPEologist> so they're not ALL doing it independently..  just that first one
[10:49:50] <tehOPEologist> wait
[10:49:52] <shoky> huh
[10:49:54] <tehOPEologist> i think i might've thought of it
[10:49:55] <tehOPEologist> sec
[10:50:01] <shoky> did you look at my paste?
[10:50:14] <tehOPEologist> ROFL
[10:50:21] <shoky> o boy
[10:50:22] <tehOPEologist> just realized what you did
[10:50:26] <tehOPEologist> and i thought of it
[10:50:31] <tehOPEologist> hirrarious
[10:50:33] <shoky> keep it simple bro
[10:50:39] <tehOPEologist> yeah i know..  <3
[10:50:51] <tehOPEologist> hm, now i need to apply the other stuffs.  thanks man :3
[10:51:02] <shoky> you should also take a look at binding with .on()
[10:51:07] <shoky> and event delegation
[10:51:18] <tehOPEologist> could you elaborate briefly on what that would do?
[10:51:32] <shoky> instead of with .click() which actually binds the handler to each div
[10:51:49] <shoky> with .on() you can delegate the event handling to a container element
[10:51:57] <shoky> so that you only bind the handler once
[10:52:14] <Xenc> Is it invalid JSON to not have quotes around the object keys?       var json = {hello: 'world'}   vs    {'hello': 'world'}
[10:52:22] <shoky> more efficient, and this also lets you add more divs to the container dynamically without needing to bind the .click() to them after theyre added
[10:52:36] <tehOPEologist> hmm, i'll look into that..
[10:52:38] <tehOPEologist> thanks :)
[10:52:45] <johnkpaul> Xenc: no, it is not valid JSON
[10:52:55] <Xenc> ok thanks !
[10:54:44] <tehOPEologist> shoky
[10:54:51] <shoky> yas
[10:55:10] <tehOPEologist> now i'm thinking of how to make it so that only one div can be "clicked" and have those jquery functions running at one time
[10:55:18] <tehOPEologist> is that just a simple if statement?
[10:55:26] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[10:55:44] <tehOPEologist> like, if one's active and one gets clicked, the first active one goes back to normal, and the new one becomes active
[10:55:51] <shoky> ah
[10:55:59] <johnkpaul> ?toggle @tehOPEologist
[10:56:00] <bot-t> tehOPEologist, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:56:08] <shoky> you can keep track of the last active one
[10:56:13] <tehOPEologist> not exactly like toggle
[10:56:17] <shoky> or just use some "active" class
[10:56:18] <tehOPEologist> that'd just be toggling the function
[10:56:22] <danielfilho> is there any place I can find a list of all common events do use with $.on()? there's nothing at api.jquery.com/on :/ (are the same on http://api.jquery.com/category/events/ ?)
[10:56:26] <shoky> then you can $('.active') to get it
[10:56:55] <tehOPEologist> hm
[10:57:02] <tehOPEologist> trying to think what would be easier..
[10:57:30] <shoky> dont think .toggle would help you if you only want one of the divs to be 'active'
[10:57:35] <tehOPEologist> right
[10:57:38] <shoky> but
[10:57:42] <shoky> all you'd have to do is
[10:57:46] <tehOPEologist> don't think that's somethingto use for this, i understand how toggle works
[10:58:06] <shoky> on click:  $('.active').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active')
[10:58:15] <tehOPEologist> trueeeeee
[10:58:29] <tehOPEologist> that's what i was thinking
[10:58:44] <tehOPEologist> just create a var = active
[10:58:51] <tehOPEologist> well
[10:58:52] <tehOPEologist> no
[10:58:53] <tehOPEologist> -_-;;
[10:59:04] <tehOPEologist> css active, with the green bg
[10:59:08] <shoky> think it through, then go through some trial and error
[10:59:11] <tehOPEologist> yehh
[10:59:14] <tehOPEologist> kk thanks man :D
[10:59:20] <shoky> then get it working, then simplify your code
[10:59:27] <shoky> np
[11:02:59] <tehOPEologist> now i'm confused..
[11:03:14] <tw2113> shoky you on twitter?
[11:03:43] <tehOPEologist> if i make a css class called "active" the only thing that'd help me out with is changing the div bg border to the green..  i don't understand how i can change the img src and the main div to the content that's linked with that employee
[11:06:25] <sunbeam> snover: argh, you were right, sorry
[11:06:25] <shoky> tw2113 i opened an account a few years ago. twitted 'disliking twitter'. a year later 'still disliking twitter'.  those are my only 2 tweets
[11:06:43] <sunbeam> Vertical Metrics wasn't enabled in my settings for some reason
[11:07:23] <sunbeam> font spacing is not so good though
[11:07:28] <tw2113> so you don't tweet often...got it :D
[11:07:45] <shoky> tw2113: https://twitter.com/#!/antishok  :)
[11:07:46] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from antishok: still disliking twitter ★ http://bit.ly/I8QRPO
[11:07:51] <shoky> Wtf
[11:07:55] <shoky> ?!
[11:08:03] <tehOPEologist> rofl
[11:08:11] * shoky kicks socialhapy
[11:08:55] <tehOPEologist> shoky, i'm confusing myself i think..
[11:08:57] <tehOPEologist> -_-;;
[11:09:09] <shoky> yer welcome to share
[11:09:26] <tehOPEologist> if i make a css class called "active" the only thing that'd help me out with is changing the div bg border to the green..  i don't understand how i can change the img src and the main div to the content that's linked with that employee
[11:10:34] <shoky> var oldActive = $('.active');   oldActive.attr(......).css(.........).whatever(............).removeClass('active');   $(this).addClass('active').attr(...).css(...).whatever(....);
[11:11:40] <shoky> $('#mainDiv').text( $(this).find('.hiddenText').text() );
[11:11:50] <shoky> etc.
[11:12:37] <shoky> tw2113 why do you ask, btw ?
[11:13:04] <tw2113> always looking for knowledgeable people to follow
[11:13:19] <jehoshua02> Quick question: I'm loading partials with .each() and .load(), but what if the partial contains a partial?
[11:13:22] <shoky> ;]
[11:13:36] <ManxPower> Does anyone know of a jQuery media plugin which supports any kind of play lists.  It doesn't look like jQuery Media (http://jquery.malsup.com/media/) supports playlists unless I'm missing something.
[11:13:44] <shoky> really you learn stuff on twitter?
[11:14:00] <johnkpaul> shoky: yes, a lot
[11:14:15] <shoky> interesting
[11:14:34] <tw2113> at worst, i get links to pages/posts/resources to learn from
[11:15:43] <shoky> so gimme yer twits i'll start by following you guys ;)
[11:15:46] <jehoshua02> anybody?
[11:16:01] <tw2113> only if you start tweeting too shoky :P
[11:16:08] <tw2113> otherwise i'll just nag you in here
[11:16:08] <shoky> yo dawg we heard you like partials..
[11:16:21] <shoky> tw2113 maybe i'll get inspired to ;p
[11:16:53] <shoky> jehoshua02, what do you mean/
[11:16:54] <shoky> ?
[11:17:01] <tw2113> @tw2113
[11:18:33] <jehoshua02> shoky: https://gist.github.com/2482281
[11:19:12] <jehoshua02> If the any of the partials contain partials, they won't be loaded. Trying to fix that.
[11:19:20] <thang> tw2113: jay-san [think japanese]
[11:19:25] <jehoshua02> Basically, this code only makes one pass at loading partials.
[11:21:35] <shoky> well
[11:21:47] <shoky> you'd need to add a callback handler to .load()
[11:22:13] <shoky> that, on partial load, does the same thing on the partial element
[11:22:17] <shoky> i suppose.
[11:22:33] <jehoshua02> shoky: endless recursion?
[11:22:48] <jehoshua02> I need to select only the new partials and load those ...
[11:22:51] <shoky> why endless? all partials have partials?
[11:23:27] <jehoshua02> shoky: I'll be reusing this piece of code on various projects.
[11:23:36] <shoky> if so that is recursive content ;D
[11:23:38] <shoky> so?
[11:23:53] <shoky> i donno, that's how you'd do what you're asking to do
[11:24:02] <shoky> if i got you right
[11:24:20] <jehoshua02> If I were to put this logic in a function, then call that function, and call the function again in the callback, I would be at risk of endless recursion.
[11:24:51] <shoky> you'd only call it from inside the load callback
[11:25:03] <shoky> and the load wont be called if there are no new partials
[11:25:05] <jehoshua02> I'd have to somehow select the partials inside each partial and only load those. If no partials inside the newly loaded partials, recursion stops.
[11:25:14] <shoky> yes that is what i meant
[11:25:20] <shoky> <shoky> that, on partial load, does the same thing on the partial element
[11:25:26] <shoky> 'on the partial element'
[11:25:40] <shoky> that's easy
[11:25:53] <shoky> $('.partial', element)
[11:26:08] <mh__> hi.. im about to use the jquery-ui buttons, but i want to show one button in one condition.. and another button in another condition.. can i do that somehow dynamic? or do i have to make 2 different dialogs?
[11:26:10] <shoky> or $(element).find('.partial')
[11:26:13] <jehoshua02> so 'element' is the parent?
[11:26:23] <jehoshua02> like $('.partial', this)
[11:27:12] <shoky> jehoshua02: yeah i think. if 'this' is the newly partial loaded, inside the callback
[11:27:28] <shoky> yeah
[11:27:31] <jehoshua02> k
[11:27:48] <jehoshua02> let me try a few things and see what I can come up with then.
[11:27:59] <shoky> k
[11:30:31] <Carlitta87_> sry...my net went
[11:30:57] <Carlitta87_> i get the concept...im just trying to play with it to see if i can make it work
[11:31:09] <Carlitta87_> JAAdule
[11:31:19] <shoky> he had to go
[11:31:26] <shoky> do you still need help?
[11:31:51] <Carlitta87_> yeh :(
[11:32:10] <Carlitta87_> ive been playing with his suggested solution
[11:32:36] <shoky> did you see his last fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/mB8mw/5/
[11:33:33] <shoky> mh__ you can do it pretty simply i think
[11:35:48] <Carlitta87_> shoky : yeh i did...thats the one ive been playing with
[11:36:41] <shoky> k
[11:36:45] <rhino> if I have a div live this:  <div id="med143">
[11:36:46] <rhino> 			<div style="width:260px;height:20px;background-color:red;float:left;">18</div>
[11:36:46] <rhino> 			<div style="width:75px;height:20px;background-color:blue;float:left;">18</div>
[11:36:46] <rhino> 			<div style="width:135px;height:20px;background-color:orange;float:left;">milligrams (mg)</div>
[11:36:46] <rhino> 			<div style="width:240px;height:20px;background-color:purple;float:left;">Twice per day or every 12 hours</div><br><br></div>  how can I change the text  of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th divs?
[11:37:31] <shoky> $('#med143 div') would select them
[11:38:31] <rhino> shoky: that just selects the parent div though.  I just need to access the individual text of the child divs.  How can I do that?
[11:38:47] <shoky> no that would select the child divs
[11:38:56] <amberfly> rhino: $("#med143 div").next() selects the second, etc.
[11:39:04] <shoky> no
[11:39:06] <Remon> is there a easy way to made a div fade in and out over and over again?
[11:39:09] <johnkpaul> $("#media143 > div") would only get direct children
[11:39:10] <amberfly> rhino: $("#med143 div") would select the first child
[11:39:22] <shoky> amberfly it selects all of them
[11:39:40] <johnkpaul> ?fadeout @Remon
[11:39:40] <bot-t> Remon, .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[11:39:56] <amberfly> shoky: Really? Hm, I never realised that
[11:39:56] <johnkpaul> in the callback, fade back in, and have them callback either other
[11:40:16] <rhino> how can I access them individually though?  I have to replace the text of the divs based on which div it's in
[11:40:17] <shoky> rhino: $('#med143 > div').each( function() {  $(this).text( 'blah' ) } )
[11:40:26] <johnkpaul> amberfly: it's called the descendant selector
[11:40:30] <johnkpaul> ?g selectutorial @ amberfly
[11:40:32] <bot-t> amberfly, Selectutorial: CSS selectors - http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/
[11:40:54] <Remon> johnkpaul, i mean that de fade will happen over and over again i cant find that in the link
[11:41:10] <johnkpaul> Remon: that link doesn't have it for you to copy and paste
[11:44:00] <johnkpaul> Remon: http://jsfiddle.net/xT6SD/
[11:44:39] <Remon> thanks alot johnkpaul, this looks usefull now i can actualy understand how it is done hehe :)
[11:46:44] <johnkpaul> no problem
[11:49:47] <shoky> so... coffeescript <-- need i go there?
[11:50:02] <shoky> i like {}
[11:50:11] <shoky> and typing function() is pretty slick
[11:50:34] <shoky> and i dont like forced style
[11:50:47] <shoky> ok thank you.
[11:51:27] <johnkpaul> shoky: was that to someone in particular? :)
[11:51:38] <shoky> to myself of course
[11:51:43] <shoky> ;D
[11:52:15] <shoky> now that i'm a twitter whore, i might as well
[12:00:40] <johnkpaul> haha
[12:00:58] <johnkpaul> I originally felt very similarly shoky, about coffeescript, but I changed my mind
[12:03:32] <aro> can you intercept a form submit with jquery using a dialog box?
[12:03:55] <smykes> So I am appending a bunch of options to a select and only getting the first letter of the first option in IE 7 and IE 8 if I hide the <select> and then show it again, all the options show up has anyone experienced this?
[12:05:18] <shoky> johnkpaul cool. maybe i'll give it a shot
[12:05:35] <aro> the tricky part is, i have two submit buttons - one triggers a delete of the data
[12:05:45] <aro> so i need to intercept ONLY when the delete action is invoked
[12:06:28] <shoky> not sure what you mean with 'using a dialog box'
[12:06:34] <guy> I am a bit lost. The output of the following. console.log( $(this).data('filter_sort'), ay.search.filter_sort, ay.search ); is price-desc price-desc []
[12:06:40] <guy> du fuk?
[12:06:40] <aro> like jquery ui dialog boxes
[12:06:51] <aro> instead of using a stupid confirm() box
[12:07:06] <shoky> smykes can you jsfiddle it
[12:07:52] <shoky> guy we are more lost than you, you've given no context
[12:08:05] <aro> is there a way to determine which submit button was pressed when a form is submitted?
[12:08:11] <guy> is "search" a reserved name in JS?
[12:08:11] <johnkpaul> aro: not OOTB
[12:08:21] <johnkpaul> but, you can add that functionality by adding a click handler
[12:08:25] <johnkpaul> that modifies some shared state
[12:08:29] <johnkpaul> that you check on the form submit handler
[12:08:42] <shoky> guy: no
[12:08:46] <aro> ok
[12:09:22] <guy> johnkpaul: what... ? aro: <input type="submit" name="foo" value="bar" />. If users clicks this button foo=bar will appear in data query.
[12:09:41] <aro> i know how to get it in the data query
[12:09:48] <johnkpaul> guy: that's not what aro asked for
[12:10:06] <aro> i just want to intercept a submit if a certain submit button is clicked, instead of using confirm()
[12:10:15] <guy> I see.
[12:11:05] <johnkpaul> aro: does it make sense what I recommended? that's the only way to get the behavior you're looking for AFAIK
[12:12:12] <aro> johnkpaul: yes it does
[12:17:02] <jehoshua02> shoky: https://gist.github.com/2482281
[12:18:45] <shoky> jehoshua02: looks good
[12:19:00] <jehoshua02> what a brainf
[12:19:20] <shoky> does it work?
[12:19:32] <jehoshua02> Yeah. just call load_partial()
[12:19:58] <shoky> brainfarts \o/
[12:20:00] <jehoshua02> Then it goes through every .partial element, using the id to build the url.
[12:20:07] <shoky> aye
[12:20:26] <jehoshua02> this will be a pretty handy piece of code.
[12:20:28] <jehoshua02> :)
[12:21:10] <shoky> :) btw you dont need the 'null' parameter there
[12:21:19] <shoky> jquery is flexible
[12:23:13] <JAAulde> sup sup?
[12:23:43] <shoky> jehoshua02 also if you want to make it more readable, add params your .each callbacks like: .each( function(index, partial) { load_partial(partial); } )
[12:23:57] <skyer2000> i'm going to use jquery autocomplete for my site, but I want to avoid hitting the database
[12:24:14] <shoky> JAAulde how's the kid
[12:24:19] <skyer2000> is there a way to create a cache file (in my case, 1500 products) that autocomplete can hit? instead of the database?
[12:24:26] <jehoshua02> hitting stuff is usually not the right solution.
[12:24:34] <skyer2000> smacking*
[12:24:45] <jehoshua02> I've heard about memcache
[12:25:02] <jehoshua02> a lot faster because it doesn't involve the disk
[12:25:03] <JAAulde> shoky: He's ok, thanks! Apparently he was jumping from the swings, and somehow landed on his back. He was reportedly unresponsive for a short period, so an ambulance was called.
[12:25:15] <shoky> ouch
[12:25:21] <JAAulde> They checked him out and released him to my wife, so we're now observing for signs of concussion
[12:25:25] <shoky> glad he survived, this time ;P
[12:25:32] <JAAulde> he's scratched and bruised, but seems ok
[12:25:44] <JAAulde> lol, this is the boy that keeps trying to off himself in random ways!
[12:25:51] <skyer2000> i will have to double check if memcache is a possible solution for my server, any other ideas to look into?
[12:26:01] <shoky> most boys do ;>
[12:26:20] <JAAulde> shoky: true, but I have 2 others and they have to show this sort of ingenuity in their attempts :D
[12:26:24] <dwarder> anyone knows how to use watch expression with google chrome? or maybe an example of this expression?
[12:26:27] <shoky> skyer2000 you mean on the serverside or clientside?
[12:26:28] <JAAulde> *have yet to show*
[12:26:42] <dwarder> can't seem to find manuals for this
[12:26:55] <skyer2000> clientside is what I'm most worried about speeding up
[12:27:11] <skyer2000> i'll have the server on a cron job to refresh the cache file or something along those lines
[12:27:50] <aro> okay
[12:28:03] <dwarder> anyone, watch expression? for chrome?
[12:28:18] <aro> johnkpaul: how would i trigger a submit of a form and make it send a specific submit name?
[12:29:39] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know how to do that aro, if using ajax, you can just put whatever data you want to
[12:31:00] <shoky> dwarder: they're just javascript expressions
[12:31:33] <dwarder> shoky: or should i insert something like if(var='somthing'){debugger;} ?
[12:31:45] <aro> im not using ajax, just regular post
[12:31:52] <aro> i think i found a way using trigger and passing extra parameters
[12:32:04] <dwarder> shoky: can you give me a proper example?
[12:32:09] <shoky> dwarder: that's a breakpoint
[12:32:12] <johnkpaul> aro: great
[12:32:42] <dwarder> shoky: in what format should i format my criteria?
[12:32:47] <shoky> dwarder: lets say you have a global 'var x = 5' , you could put a watch expression: x
[12:32:52] <shoky> and it'd show you: 5
[12:33:07] <shoky> dwarder: what criteria?
[12:33:25] <dwarder> shoky: i thought that expression is supposed to stop execution upon a certain criteria is meet
[12:33:32] <dwarder> shoky: like x ==5
[12:33:45] <shoky> no that's breakpoints i believe
[12:34:01] <dwarder> shoky: i can just _set_ the breakpoints
[12:34:10] <dwarder> shoky: without this expressions
[12:34:25] <dwarder> i guess this are smart expression
[12:34:27] <dwarder> s
[12:34:36] <dwarder> shoky: i just don't know how to form it
[12:34:43] <shoky> watch expressions are just for watching, afaik
[12:34:45] <dwarder> shoky: and i can't find any info on that
[12:35:00] <shoky> and i dont know how to set a breakpoint on 'x == 5', there might be a way
[12:36:59] <Whirl3d> what happens when you use css3 transitions and you have display:none in one class, then add the transition class with display:"blocK' (and the transformation animation for height, for example)..how does it handle non-scalar properties?
[12:37:45] <shoky> what's the effect?
[12:38:15] <Whirl3d> animate height from 0 to 100%
[12:38:23] <dwarder> shoky: you are right, watch is for watching complex vars
[12:38:26] <shoky> yeah but thats scalar
[12:38:44] <dwarder> shoky: everytime you step in
[12:38:48] <Whirl3d> sure. But the nonscalar parts? How does it handle them?
[12:39:05] <shoky> Whirl3d that's what i was asking, what are the visible effects of the nonscalar changes?
[12:39:07] <Whirl3d> just switdhes them?
[12:39:19] <Whirl3d> display: none to display:block
[12:39:23] <Whirl3d> for example.
[12:39:32] <Whirl3d> or position:absolute, to position:relative
[12:39:33] <shoky> does it fade? just appear?
[12:40:35] <Whirl3d> I'll setup a fiddle. brb. Thanks for your help.
[12:40:56] <shoky> i was asking because i have no clue
[12:41:35] <Whirl3d> Me neither, that's when a fiddle often helps me articulate what I am asking. 8)
[12:41:58] <zyltoid> when using event delegation on click, how cna i get the element i'm hovering over when i click on the delegatee?
[12:42:41] <shoky> so you're clicking on that element, not on the delegate, no ?
[12:43:03] <shoky> or can you hover over one element and simultaneously click another?

[13:04:33] <imsky> no you're a towel
[13:04:43] <shoky> im soaking with it

[13:23:36] <rhino> is it possible to call a php function using javascript or jquery?
[13:24:32] <JAAulde> rhino: it's possible to request (or cause the browser to request) a URL which executes a PHP script that calls your function
[13:25:45] <Carlitta87> johnkpaul , jrockjiggz both work well...im gonna try them now
[13:25:51] <Carlitta87> thnk u
[13:26:14] <rhino> JAAulde:  is that considered an ajax call?  what would that call look like?
[13:26:16] <aJacom> I want to set a :hover CSS style, if a certain variable is true. How can I do it ?
[13:26:26] <skyer2000> i have to append a bunch of html, how do i do that without having to use a single line?
[13:26:37] <JAAulde> rhino: AJAX is one method, yes. Do you already have jQuery available?
[13:26:49] <silverwind> skyer2000, concatenate?
[13:26:49] <JAAulde> rhino: or are you using JS minus a library?
[13:26:52] <solsTiCe> hi. I am binding 'touchstart' event to a fucntion showing  a qtip tooltip for every area defined on a map. a secondd tap will follow the link if the tooltip is still visible. it works. but now I want that a tap anywhere else to close the tooltip. but I can't bind to touchstart because it will hide the tooltip as soon as it is displayed. how can I do what I want, then ?
[13:27:34] <skyer2000> i want to format the HTML nicely in multiple lines... for example:
[13:27:49] <NoiseEee> skyer2000: stuff = [];  stuff.push('<div>hi</div>');  stuff.push('<div>bye</div>');  $('#elID').update(stuff.join(''))
[13:28:05] <NoiseEee> s/update/html
[13:28:26] <rhino> JAAulde:  I have jquery already installed.  I already call the function w/ staraight php in the page, but need to use it to append data to a div when a user clicks on a certain btn.  how would I accomplish this?
[13:28:33] <rhino> w/ jquery
[13:29:05] <dv310p3r> Using Jquery UI's draggable, I am dragging items from one div to another. The other div they are being dragged into needs to scroll so i can see other items I can drop the selected item into, but I can't get it to scroll. Help?
[13:29:37] <JAAulde> rhino: ok, you need to add a page which does nothing but call that function and output whatever it outputs. call that with $.ajax(), and in the success method read in the given data (which came from your server) and do what you need to do to append it
[13:29:38] <skyer2000> NoiseEee that worked great
[13:30:28] <NoiseEee> skyer2000: always better to push/join an array then concatenate a bunch of strings.
[13:30:40] <skyer2000> ok, thank you
[13:30:44] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[13:30:50] <rhino> JAAulde:  do you know of any good tutorials/examples on how to do this?
[13:31:35] <JAAulde> rhino: have you looked through http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:33:25] <rhino> JAAulde:  where would the php function call go in that statement/how do I pass either the js or php vars for the ajax call??
[13:34:11] <JAAulde> rhino: the php function call doesn't go in the JS.  you call a URL which you have defined on your server to call your PHP function. any data you need to send goes in the data option of the ajax call
[13:34:37] <rhino> ah, tnx
[13:34:49] <rhino> JAAulde:  tnx
[13:35:15] <JAAulde> rhino: no prob. seeing if I can make some sort of simplified example for you
[13:35:45] <rhino> JAAulde:  I'd greatly appreciate it
[13:38:33] <Whirl3d> If my animation function animates the height of an object from 0 to 100 and back over 5 seconds and about halfway through the animation, I stop it and reverse it, how do I adjust the properties of my new animation to account for easing, current state, and time difference?
[13:39:18] <rhino> JAAulde:  any luck w/ the simplified example?
[13:39:28] <JAAulde> rhino: lol, working
[13:39:39] <Whirl3d> I'm afraid it is going to take differential equations....
[13:40:27] <rhino> JAAulde:  your at work right now, or your trying to work on the example, LOL?
[13:40:39] <NoiseEee> rhino: there's about a billion examples on the web of how to use jquery, ajax, and php.
[13:40:42] <JAAulde> rhino: both :)
[13:41:03] <rhino> JAAulde:  either way, tnx for your assistance!!
[13:41:06] <NoiseEee> rhino: can always start with http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[13:45:50] <imsky> man how do you teach jquery to people who don't know javascript
[13:46:19] <markq> you can't
[13:46:23] <BaruchHashem> reverse that
[13:46:41] <imsky> seems to be a common problem in these jquery times
[13:46:46] <markq> well
[13:46:46] <BaruchHashem> how do you teach js to people who know jquery
[13:46:54] <Xenc> how do you teach a cat to sing
[13:47:03] <markq> you give up ^
[13:47:43] <imsky> lol jquery jobs: 800,000% growth since '06
[13:48:07] <ale666> hello
[13:48:11] <imsky> hello there sir
[13:48:16] <ale666> i have a simple jquery question
[13:48:19] <imsky> here it comes
[13:48:34] <ale666> id like to further refine queries
[13:48:37] <markq> what's so difficult about jQuery, the world needs more pure javascript programmers
[13:48:48] <markq> hardcore vanilla javascript
[13:48:56] <imsky> markq, yes i too enjoy writing .appendChild
[13:49:04] <markq> no
[13:49:04] <imsky> because it makes me feel leet in my pants
[13:49:06] <markq> not for dom stuff
[13:49:24] <markq> I mean just have a broader knowledge of how JS actually works in jQuery
[13:49:33] <imsky> you tell em kid
[13:49:40] <markq> and then use that knowledge to build on top of jQuery
[13:49:43] <markq> plugins and stuff
[13:49:48] <markq> and possibly work with node
[13:50:41] <markq> javascript is pretty powerful stuff and jQuery does a spectacular job of working with the crappy dom api in a clean fashion that is nicely abstracted to the developer
[13:53:00] <ale666> ok sorry obviously yes with find
[13:53:10] <JAAulde_> rhino: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8238943/irc_rhino.zip
[13:55:28] <JAAulde_> rhino: the file, myfoo.php, defines the function. index.php includes myfoo.php, calls the function on initial load, and provides a button to call getmyfoo.php via ajax. getmyfoo.php simply includes myfoo.php and calls the function again
[13:55:45] <JAAulde_> rhino: the ajax code receives the response and appends it to an element in the DOM
[14:00:37] <JAAulde_> rhino: got it?
[14:01:39] <saml> hey, how can I set the last .foo  hidden?
[14:01:47] <saml> oh  jq.find('.foo').hide()
[14:01:51] <saml> no.. last .foo
[14:02:32] <JAAulde_> saml $('.foo:last').hide()
[14:03:01] <Carlitta87> how do i give a div multiple attributes?
[14:03:19] <NoiseEee> Carlitta87: what kind of attributes?
[14:03:30] <Carlitta87> just attr("id". ... , "class", ... )
[14:03:35] <Carlitta87> ?
[14:03:57] <NoiseEee> Carlitta87: $('#div').prop({id:'newID','class':'banana'})
[14:04:06] <saml> JAAulde_, you are so smart
[14:04:13] <JAAulde_> saml: lawlz, thanks
[14:04:23] <Carlitta87> :)
[14:04:27] <JAAulde_> ok, rhino, well I hope that helped.  gotta roll
[14:04:29] <JAAulde_> peace all
[14:08:13] <Carlitta87> NoisEee: this is wat i used var newBuilding = $(document.createElement('div')).attr("id", 'buildinginfo' + counter);
[14:08:24] <Carlitta87> shud i just scrap it
[14:08:25] <Carlitta87> ?
[14:14:12] <NoiseEee> Carlitta87: var newBuilding = $('<div>').prop('id','buildinginfo'+counter);
[14:14:29] <mmealling> what is the best event on a .sortable for updating the item's id to match its position?
[14:15:08] <jrockjiggz> offset?
[14:17:01] <jrockjiggz> mmealling: $('li').each( function(e, i){ $(this).prop('id',i); });
[14:17:34] <mmealling> ahhhh... yes, I saw that once. I was wondering how I'd renumber all of them. perfect. Thanks!
[14:17:40] <JAAulde> Ooh, rockin' LimeChat on the iPhone
[14:18:26] <rroelofs> jrockjiggz: I don't hink you can have bare numeric ids
[14:18:49] <Whirl3d> so, on the load success handler for an image element, you are supposed to be able to access it's natural width and height. can someone remind me of how exactly?
[14:19:31] <jrockjiggz> rroelofs: you are right, you would .pro('id','someIdName'+i)
[14:19:45] <jrockjiggz> *prop
[14:19:56] <mmealling> yea, I turned it into .prop('id',"movie" + i)
[14:20:54] <rroelofs> Whirl3d:  create a js image var, set it's source and load event listner, when load fires you can query width and height.  Keep it out of the dom until you have this info.
[14:21:36] <jrockjiggz> var img = $('<img>').load('src.jpg'); img.height(); i believe
[14:21:48] <sunbeam> how can I place (with js, after the closing of class .blabla <span class="blabla">..</span> a <br /> ?
[14:21:48] <Whirl3d> Oh, so you don't have to append it to the dom to load it? Nice.
[14:22:07] <gho5t> can someone take a look at this little snippet and tell me why it's not wrapping correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/Ancc4/4/
[14:22:23] <Whirl3d> $("<img>").load(handler).attr('src',url);
[14:22:33] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[14:24:33] <ak87> Hello.I v got a main image with some thumbnails.On thumb hover main image changes.How can i add a gray overlay to the main image till the new one is loaded?Any guidance?Thanks in advacne
[14:24:55] <shoky> gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Ancc4/5/
[14:25:12] <NoReGreT> can someone help here, http://jsfiddle.net/2xCc8/ the issue is, it works fine on the first click, but not on subsequent ones
[14:25:57] <gho5t> shoky: d'oh. thanks
[14:25:58] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: is it also possible to make a conditional statement with jquery if browser == ie6?
[14:26:15] <shoky> NoReGreT: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2xCc8/1/
[14:26:21] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: the idea behind jquery is to do away with all ie6/etc browser sniffing
[14:26:26] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: why do you want to do that?
[14:26:31] <sayd> i need to essentially recycle an event. the trigger is happening on a dispatcher which im kicking off manually, but i'd like e.target to be the thing that kicked off my manual trigger
[14:27:32] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i got some annoying issue, i have a li with 2 span's inside, they are block and they need to be stacked on each other. the li's are the page main navigation. without setting a width IE6 (as only browser) will use the full width of the page for each li
[14:27:33] <shoky> sayd you can .trigger( eventObj )
[14:28:00] <sayd> ah cool
[14:28:03] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: all other browsers consider the max width the content when i float: left; all the li's
[14:28:08] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: fix your css issues and leave JS / browser sniffing alone
[14:28:14] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: you want a css fix, not a js fix.
[14:28:20] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: so i thought, just place (conditionally) a <br />
[14:28:21] <sayd> so something like { type:'mycustomtype', target:e.target }
[14:28:22] <sunbeam> I don't think there is one
[14:28:30] <sunbeam> (for this issue)
[14:28:37] <sayd> or do I have to new jQuery.Event()
[14:28:50] <shoky> sayd: take the old event object you wanted to recycle, no?
[14:28:54] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: clear:both on the following element?
[14:28:57] <shoky> and change its target
[14:29:01] <sunbeam> tried already NoiseEee
[14:29:37] <aarobc_work1> So I'm trying to use $.getJSON on 'ajax/catchJson.php'
[14:29:37] <aarobc_work1> but in the console for some reason it's trying to send it to localhost/test/localhost/test/ajax/catchJson.php
[14:30:01] <sayd> shoky: the prob is thats just a generic click
[14:30:12] <whoisthis> hello
[14:30:15] <jrockjiggz> aarobc_work1: code?
[14:30:18] <whoisthis> http://jsfiddle.net/TxjQ6/
[14:30:28] <sayd> basically im doing .click(function(e){obj.trigger('fancy')})
[14:30:37] <whoisthis> try to click the button - first time it works all right, second time .pressed class doesn't seem to be removed :(
[14:30:59] <sayd> but where im bound to fancy in another place i want to know what clicked/triggered it
[14:31:03] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: you need to set width on the span's or li's, there is no other way
[14:31:32] <mmealling> hmm.... OK, that $('li').each(function(e,i){...} shoudl work, but isn't. Any idea what I'm doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/wTZHp/
[14:32:05] <mmealling> The working version is here: http://rocketforge.org/topfivelikeme/code/autocomplete.html (just enter the names of movies)
[14:32:20] <shoky> sayd so add parameters to the event obj
[14:33:08] <sayd> will things implode if i change e.target before triggering it?
[14:33:10] <shoky> sayd yeah like you said .trigger({ type:'mycustomtype', target:e.target })
[14:33:16] <jrockjiggz> mmealling: i dont see the code in there
[14:33:28] <shoky> sayd yea dont use the original one, sorry
[14:33:49] <mmealling> doh... forgot to hit update.... look now
[14:34:03] <mmealling> 6th line in the script section
[14:35:12] <jrockjiggz> mmealling: theres no <LI> in your html?
[14:35:35] <mmealling> the autocomplete.click creates tehm
[14:35:55] <jrockjiggz> try just function(i)
[14:36:04] <mmealling> sorry.... autocomplete.select()
[14:37:54] <mmealling> hmm.... no dice... nothing in console so its like the selector is wrong since its not even stepping into that function at all
[14:38:08] <jrockjiggz> mmealling: i'm getting an infite loop on your page
[14:39:04] <mmealling> you are? huh.... on just autocomplete.html?
[14:39:35] <mmealling> what browser?
[14:44:05] <mmealling> can't get it to loop on any browser
[14:44:32] <jrockjiggz> i think its because it was waiting for response but my browser locked because get is not async
[14:45:18] <mmealling> yea, the get for the autocomplete will be changed to caching fucntion instead of the simple get
[14:45:55] <BinaryKitten> jrockjiggz what do you mean that get is not async?
[14:46:50] <jrockjiggz> mmealling: it seems to be working now http://jsfiddle.net/wTZHp/6/
[14:48:13] <jrockjiggz> BinaryKitten: i just assumed that is why.. doesnt make sense
[14:48:55] <mmealling> ah! put it in the autocomplete source: event. I'll need to put it in .sortable's stop: event as well.
[14:49:49] <whoisthis> hmm, how do I simply make something execute on keypress? Documentation seems messy, I don't know why $('#something'). is everywhere before keydown/keyup/keypress
[14:50:34] <whoisthis> should I just use $('body').keypress(...)? ;)
[14:50:45] <amberfly> $(document).keypress()
[14:50:54] <whoisthis> hmm
[14:51:10] <amberfly> No, sorry
[14:51:12] <whoisthis> will that prevent me from using text fields with these characters?
[14:51:21] <amberfly> $(window), not $(document)
[14:51:34] <whoisthis> ok, let me try this :)

[15:00:26] <zim> shoky: Ty will give it a go
[15:00:33] <whoisthis> amberfly: thanks, I made it work all right, with one exception
[15:00:55] <whoisthis> I binded for example "1" and "2" buttons...when I type them inside of any text field, they still "execute"
[15:01:00] <whoisthis> and I don't want this
[15:03:17] <shoky> whoisthis: if ($(event.target).is('input[type="text"]'))          return;
[15:03:38] <shoky> worked for me

[15:05:41] <Tasser> how do I wait for elements to be appended?
[15:05:53] <laken> How can I share variables between scripts running on the same page? I tried this technique (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2866866/jquery-global-variable-best-practice-options#2866920) and declared the namespace and var definitions in file1.js, but file2.js can't access the namespaced vars. Any help?
[15:06:22] <shoky> laken: pastebin would help
[15:07:42] <laken> shoky: coming up…
[15:08:55] <laken> shoky: http://pastebin.com/iL6KvW8m
[15:09:14] <shoky> dude
[15:09:14] <laken> I am getting '$.booths is undefined' in file2.js
[15:09:22] <shoky> avail['choice']
[15:09:29] <shoky> is not $.booths.avail['choice']
[15:09:45] * laken facepalms
[15:09:51] <laken> been a long day :-)
[15:09:52] <shoky> ;P
[15:09:56] <laken> brb
[15:13:32] <laken> shoky: no love, corrected that but still get $.booths is undefined: http://pastebin.com/iL6KvW8m
[15:13:56] <laken> do I need to do anything to import that namespace into the second file?
[15:14:06] <shoky> no
[15:14:12] <shoky> umm and what about your html
[15:15:05] <tw2113> save the htmls!
[15:15:23] <shoky> its all for the htmls
[15:16:30] <laken> shoky: does the order the .js files are included in matter?
[15:16:40] <shoky> very much
[15:16:50] <shoky> just imagine that they are laid out in that same order inside of your html
[15:17:47] <laken> shoky: and should namespace code be inside $(document).ready(function() { block?
[15:18:24] <shoky> mmm the code that declares the namespace?
[15:18:38] <shoky> that shouldn't be in the ready handler
[15:18:47] <laken> cool…
[15:18:54] <shoky> unless all code that references it is also in the ready handler
[15:18:57] <shoky> or run afterwards
[15:19:18] <michaelfavia> inside a plugin $(this).offset.top; works but if i stick that inside of a function i call from the plugin it refers to a DOMWindow instead.
[15:19:46] <michaelfavia> ami missing some context i should be setting for the function? does it need to pbe implemented as an extension of something?
[15:19:47] <shoky> michaelfavia, 'this' is special
[15:20:09] <shoky> dont just stick things into other things
[15:20:14] <shoky> at least not when coding
[15:20:35] <shoky> or you'll impregnate your source with gooey bugs
[15:20:36] <michaelfavia> shoky, im reasonably well versed in OOP but im tryign to operate on the plugin item that was selected via $()
[15:20:43] <michaelfavia> what is the prefered way to do that?
[15:21:14] <BrotherRodriguez> wouldn't want to impregnate the code
[15:21:40] <shoky> michaelfavia then you would have to cache 'this' in a variable
[15:21:44] <shoky> if im getting you right
[15:22:04] <michaelfavia> shoky, trying now.
[15:23:05] <evasivx> Does anyone have /any/ idea on why this slider doesn't work in IE9? http://projectomni.com/norantel/
[15:24:02] <shoky> evasivx: what slider
[15:24:15] <evasivx> shoky, "image rotator"?
[15:26:17] <shoky> works fine..
[15:27:02] <shoky> perfect
[15:27:06] <Single14821> hello all
[15:27:53] <evasivx> shoky, all i see is the loading animated gif...you sure you're using IE9?
[15:28:12] <shoky> yeah
[15:28:24] <shoky> but now i reloaded and i see the loading gif too
[15:29:05] <shoky> now i see it work again
[15:29:06] * xp_prg just understood the power of .click *phew*
[15:29:08] <shoky> relaoded a few times
[15:29:59] <shoky> evasivx want a screenshot? ;p
[15:30:24] <raj> can I bind something to jquery-ui's dialog's closing outside of its instantiation with its options?
[15:30:47] <raj> yo shoky
[15:30:56] <shoky> hey rajy
[15:30:57] <raj> sending people your dirty screen shots again?
[15:31:07] <shoky> ;P so far everyone's loved them
[15:31:09] <aarobc_work> So, is there a way to send the name of the object when sending json?
[15:31:22] <shoky> aarobc_work: what?
[15:32:03] <evasivx> shoky, i believe you. It works for me once i reload a few times or click on other pages...Any idea on whats going on or how to fix it?
[15:32:04] <raj> you're a connoisseur of deviation
[15:32:26] <shoky> heh
[15:32:53] <shoky> evasivx: no idea, besides the fact that the site just generally loads really slowly
[15:34:49] <evasivx> shoky, fixed, it was because that one had window.load instead of document.ready
[15:36:34] <shoky> oh
[15:36:47] <shoky> window.load not reliable?
[15:37:09] <aarobc_work> shoky: so I'm using $.ajax to send an object via json to a php script, but I'm noticing that the actual name of the object isn't sent. Is there any way to do that?
[15:37:25] <evasivx> shoky, no idea. I don't even know how to code in javascript and can only modify jquery scripts to fit my needs. Just tried that and it worked
[15:38:20] <shoky> aarobc_work you can send an object containing the name and the original object..
[15:39:00] <shoky> { name: 'aarobc', obj: originialObj }
[15:39:15] <aarobc_work> Ah, okay, that works
[15:39:23] <sunbeam> is there way in jquery (or css) where you can make sure that a #div has only 1 word per line?
[15:39:29] <aarobc_work> was just curious if there was a more elegant method.
[15:41:56] <shoky> aarobc if you want you can also just attach a name field to the original object
[15:43:25] <shoky> raj: sure
[15:43:32] <shoky> re your dialog question
[15:43:41] <raj> found it on SO

[15:43:51] <shoky> its on the docs
[15:43:55] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close
[15:44:03] <raj> you one upping sob
[15:44:08] <shoky> lolll
[15:44:08] <raj> i like SO
[15:44:25] <shoky> me too but for stuff thats not already properly documented :P
[15:44:35] <shoky> i wrote my first SO answer a few days ago
[15:44:40] <shoky> r u pr0ud.
[15:44:53] <shoky> i think the question was like a month old :
[15:44:54] <shoky> :\
[15:45:08] <shoky> and his code was mostly in spanish :/
[15:47:22] <sunbeam> is there a way that can have max-width with IE6 behave the same as it would with FF etc?
[16:12:10] <o-O-o> http://jsfiddle.net/QwdLs/
[16:13:28] <sayd> surely im not understanding the plugin architecture. this code stinks http://pastebin.com/UiMxibpJ. all the .data('plugin') business
[16:14:42] <sayd> but thats what I got from the plugin architecture doc
[16:17:17] <shoky> sayd how else would you have data that's bound to the selected elements?
[16:23:09] <sayd> i'd think it would be encapsulated by the plugin itself
[16:26:55] <shoky> but you're the one making the plugin
[16:27:22] <shoky> jquery doesn't do anything, there's no plugin factory or smth
[16:28:05] <shoky> a plugin is basically a function/closure
[16:28:10] <shoky> just like any other
[16:39:17] <sayd> shoky yeah im just not sure how i could rewrite that in a sane way
[16:39:52] <sayd> its not doing much right now so im trying to get a good base/foundation built
[16:40:47] <sayd> win b
[16:48:13] <keith_hyfn> just curious, anyone know the reason why the jqXHR success(), error(), and complete() callbacks are getting deprecated in favor of done(), fail(), and always()? No real reason I need to know, I just re-read it in the docs and was curious....
[16:49:06] <shoky> sayd i guess you could do something like: http://pastebin.com/r3dzVqmW
[16:49:07] <keith_hyfn> btw, just to clarify, the deprecation will happen as of jQuery 1.8
[16:49:30] <shoky> keith_hyfn: why have redundant methods?
[16:50:22] <keith_hyfn> shoky: oh i guess i don't know the order in which the methods were first defined. I assumed that success, error, and complete came before done, fail, and always.
[16:50:40] <shoky> keith_hyfn: done(), fail(), and always() are general deferred objects' methods. and the ajax mechanism was rewritten to use deferreds
[16:50:50] <sayd> shoky: thats cool, thanks!
[16:51:00] <shoky> np
[16:51:07] <keith_hyfn> shoky: oh right, i did read that in the documentation, well that actually clarifies it perfectly, thanks
[17:16:10] <Ring0`> Hi. When I add input FILE field using jQuery (.append(field)), it wont be passed to php during submit :(
[17:16:32] <Ring0`> I checked that if I add same file manually it will pass files correctly.
[17:23:31] <tw2113> IE8 can do consoles?
[17:27:39] <xp_prg> how do I send enter in a form text field?
[17:28:08] <xp_prg> $("#formid input[type='text']").enter(); ?
[17:30:29] <sayd> xp_prg: try i
[17:30:34] <sayd> xp_prg: try it
[17:30:46] <xp_prg> I did, object has no method enter
[17:35:32] <sayd> .keypress() maybe?
[17:36:05] <sayd> not sure you need the quotes in type=
[17:36:35] <sayd> $("#formid input[type=text]").enter();
[17:40:02] <thebignoise> xp_prg: its $('#formid input[type=text])
[17:40:07] <thebignoise> oops sorry
[17:40:13] <thebignoise> $('#formid input[type=text])
[17:40:15] <thebignoise> shit
[17:40:15] <thebignoise> lol
[17:40:31] <thebignoise> $('#formid input["type=text"]')

[17:41:56] <shoky> )
[17:42:15] <shoky> xp_prg why are you doing it
[17:42:31] <sayd> thebignoise: thats what he had
[17:43:36] <sayd> i guess slightly different but the inner quotes are not needed i think
[17:43:39] <shoky> oh sorry you have $.ui only with jquery ui
[17:43:54] <sayd> which: 13
[17:43:57] <shoky> xp_prg:  $(...).trigger( $.Event( 'keydown', { which: 13 } ) )
[17:44:32] <thebignoise> xp_prg: $('#form1 input"[type=text]"')
[17:44:41] <shoky> thebignoise: his problem was not the selector

[17:45:26] <xp_prg> jquery dataTable search trying to cause it to execute
[17:45:26] <thebignoise> what is he trying to do?
[17:45:43] <jstout24> So, i have a form that does an ajax call… I want to refresh the page, and contents on a dialog based on given inputs… what's the best way to do this while keeping the dialogs intact and refreshing the titles, and content within it where it's needed
[17:45:50] <shoky> xp_prg sending the enter key to an input is probably not the recommended way to cause it to execute
[17:45:58] <shoky> or is it :S
[17:46:23] <xp_prg> well how do I make it execute?
[17:46:35] <shoky> look in the docs, i dont know it
[17:46:42] <shoky> link me if you want, i can look for you...
[17:46:44] <thebignoise> jstout24: huh?
[17:47:33] <shoky> jstout24: just update the changed fields
[17:47:54] <jstout24> shoky, manually every time?  i have around 50-70 forms
[17:48:03] <shoky> wat
[17:48:14] <shoky> 50-70 forms for which you are getting ajax data at once?
[17:48:41] <sayd> jstout24: templates?
[17:49:26] <shoky> jstout24 i use knockoutjs for that stuff
[17:49:34] <shoky> i recommend
[17:49:45] <sayd> yep, or angularjs
[17:50:24] <jstout24> shoky, nice
[17:51:04] <jstout24> angular is sexy too
[17:52:08] <jstout24> too bad i use twig and they use the same selectors, lol
[17:52:39] <sayd> twig is server side
[17:53:19] <systemfault> sayd: They will still conflict
[17:54:14] <sayd> im using them both
[17:54:26] <o-O-o> can I use/change custom attributes with .attr()  ?
[17:54:30] <jstout24> sayd, if i put {{asdf}} in my view, twig will try to use it first
[17:54:47] <jstout24> hmm, wonder if angular has the ability to hcange the lexer
[17:55:04] <shoky> o-O-o yes
[17:55:24] <shoky> o-O-o but better to use .data() for that stuff
[17:57:59] <jstout24> http://docs-next.angularjs.org/api/angular.module.ng.$interpolateProvider
[17:57:59] <jstout24> :)
[18:03:55] <shoky> ;]
[18:16:56] <shadykhan> how can i make a mini script so that when i click on a day it will switch out the content and add a class to the link?
[18:16:57] <shadykhan> http://jsfiddle.net/YM9Xm/2/
[18:19:28] <xp_prg> I am confused I created a dataTables instance and assigned the variable to window
[18:19:34] <jrockjiggz> shadykhan: http://jsfiddle.net/YM9Xm/3/
[18:19:40] <xp_prg> I try to use it somewhere else and it is supposedly undefined
[18:20:34] <jrockjiggz> oops, http://jsfiddle.net/YM9Xm/4/
[18:20:39] <shadykhan> jrockjiggz, is that really the best way? because im doing it for all  7 days?
[18:21:28] <jrockjiggz> for 7 days it will work fine
[18:21:51] <shadykhan> but im also adding a class to 'monday' 'tuesday'
[18:21:54] <shadykhan> to show that its highlighted
[18:22:03] <xp_prg> anyone have any ideas what I am doing wrong?
[18:26:38] <mike817> anyone use the validate plugin? i'm trying to find a a way to make a field required, but not show a message
[18:31:59] <min|dvir|us> Can someone explain to me why the closure on line 7 (inside the while) is required?
[18:32:00] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/G5FBt/3/
[18:52:49] <ManxPower> I'm using $['img').attr('src', 'http://whatever/image.jpg') to load an image, once the image is finished loading I need to resize it using a plugin or function.  How can I make sure the resizer is called after the image is finished loading?
[18:56:18] <Wilornel> MansxPower: I belive this you could use .done()
[18:56:51] <Wilornel> Maybe .ready();
[19:02:50] <ManxPower> thanks
[19:03:38] <ManxPower> something like $['img').attr('src', 'http://whatever/image.jpg').done(run resizer) ?
[19:05:07] <ManxPower> these are dynamically loaded, of course.
[19:09:13] <ManxPower> apparently .attr does not support a done() method
[19:13:00] <shoky> min|dvir|us:
[19:13:11] <min|dvir|us> shoky: whadup son?
[19:13:36] <min|dvir|us> shoky: Oh, I solved my problem.
[19:13:46] <min|dvir|us> It's because argsComplete is overwritten.
[19:13:49] <shoky> yes
[19:14:07] <shoky> because of the .complete = function() { ....
[19:14:09] <shoky> closure
[19:14:12] <min|dvir|us> Yes.
[19:14:18] <shoky> which references argsComplete
[19:14:29] <shoky> but when its called then it would get the wrong one
[19:14:50] <min|dvir|us> shoky++;
[19:15:05] <shoky> tnx
[19:15:07] <shoky> gnight
[19:37:12] <diegoviola> hi
[19:37:22] <diegoviola> i'm trying to validate some inputs with ajax, etc, any ideas what to use?
[19:37:38] <diegoviola> or where to look at
[19:43:49] <diegoviola> should i just use $.ajax() for that?
[20:00:41] <blendedbychris> is there a selector for visibility?
[20:09:36] <thomasgriffin> How can I make it to where $.each(children) does not fire until the children var is completely populated? https://gist.github.com/b98b848045e7e6b2ef42
[20:10:36] <thomasgriffin> As it stands now, it is looping through children before it is completely populated and I'm not sure how to set it to where I can avoid this race condition
[20:21:30] <jrockjiggz> thomasgriffin: children must complete before the next line.. your problem may lie elsewhere
[20:45:37] <rhino_> what is the best way to use jquery to call a php function that creates the html for a dropdown list?
[20:46:16] <paladinn> best way is /quit
[20:46:42] <rhino_> paladinn:  ??
[20:49:08] <tw2113> wouldn't that be a basic ajax call?
[20:49:24] <tw2113> well, assuming you put the php part in a different file
[20:53:46] <ManxPower> Is there any in jQuery to find out of the browser (or window) is hidden or not?
[20:54:19] <paladinn> any DOM ?
[20:54:26] <Cork> only way is the blur event on the window object
[20:54:42] <Cork> other then that; no
[20:55:09] <ManxPower> blur would tell me if the window no longer has focus?
[20:55:18] <Cork> yes
[20:55:27] <Cork> its not optimal, but...
[20:55:31] <ManxPower> that might be ok for my needs
[21:00:24] <michaelfavia> shoky, thank you that worked earliey shoky++
[21:24:46] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to blur an element that doesn't blur if inside content is clicked
[21:25:35] <jrockjiggz> $('el').blur works if inside content is clicked.. how to avoid?
[21:27:44] <Cork> jrockjiggz: well your moving focus from one element to another, focus doens't really have a child parent relation
[21:28:21] <jrockjiggz> i have a dialogue that i want to close if clicked outside.. something like $(document).not('.bugAlertBox').click()
[21:28:23] <Cork> jrockjiggz: use .focus instead and check if the focused element has the el as parent
[21:28:56] <Cork> you prob want click instead of focus ya
[21:30:55] <Cork> $(document).on('click.dialog', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('.bugAlertBox').length > 0) { return } $(document).off('click.dialog'); });
[21:31:13] <Cork> and do your action after the off command
[21:31:18] <jrockjiggz> thanks i'll try
[21:47:10] <blendedbychris> anyone know a decent way to select all "file" type links?
[21:47:29] <blendedbychris> like a link that is NOT a directory and NOT a .html/.php file maybe?
[21:48:22] <jrockjiggz> $('a').not('[href^="/"')
[21:48:33] <jrockjiggz> just a guess
[21:48:45] <blendedbychris> that would presume all directory links end with /
[21:49:01] <blendedbychris> can you do regex?
[21:49:35] <blendedbychris> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/ << crazy
[21:49:52] <jrockjiggz> thats a extension
[21:50:12] <blendedbychris> right
[21:51:54] <jrockjiggz> $('a').filter( function(){ return this.id.match(regexHere); });
[22:03:09] <jrockjiggz> blendedbychris: made a template.. but i can't get the match to work http://jsfiddle.net/7b8Wz/
[22:03:31] <blendedbychris> jrockjiggz: yea been messing with that extension… doesn't seem to like the $ for "ends width"
[22:03:39] <blendedbychris> was trying something like \..+$
[22:06:11] <goddard> how can i test and make sure this is returning the correct values ?
[22:06:13] <goddard> http://pastebin.com/58DepCuB
[22:06:28] <goddard> i figured the msg value would return the result but it returns nothing
[22:07:08] <blendedbychris> jrockjiggz: how can i do \s{2,4}
[22:07:14] <blendedbychris> where \s is some char
[22:07:20] <jrockjiggz> slice?
[22:07:37] <blendedbychris> oh wait
[22:08:00] <blendedbychris> regex for 2-4 chracters no including punctuation
[22:08:05] <blendedbychris> just crap that might be an extension of a file
[22:08:07] <blendedbychris> (typically)
[22:08:31] <jrockjiggz> goddard: looking at the specs, i think you first need to create a Deferred object before you can use done()
[22:09:07] <jrockjiggz> blendedbychris: my regex foo is lacking
[22:09:23] <jrockjiggz> #regex can help you
[22:10:00] <goddard> jrockjiggz: whats that?
[22:12:19] <goddard> ajax and post whats the difference?
[22:12:28] <goddard> .ajax .post
[22:13:00] <jrockjiggz> post is a shortcut of ajax() that sends as type: "POST"
[22:14:02] <jrockjiggz> goddard: change done() to success()
[22:14:32] <jrockjiggz> you can see an example here http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/Mrqf8/
[22:14:59] <goddard> thanks
[22:15:08] <goddard> gotta love irc
[22:15:14] <jrockjiggz> =D
[22:19:30] <jrockjiggz> some css styles have multiple browser prefixes.. but in jquery.css({ background: '-moz-...', background: '-webkit-...'}); will overwrite the moz property.
[22:19:45] <jrockjiggz> know a way todo this?
[22:21:21] <Cork> jrockjiggz: ya, use classes
[22:21:30] <jrockjiggz> ah good idea
[22:21:34] <Cork> you should be doing it that way anyway
[22:21:50] <Cork> inline css should only be used for as an exception
[22:22:08] <Cork> (or for animation)
[22:22:11] <jrockjiggz> well, i was applying a color based on variable
[22:24:18] <Cork> man i never expected mobile webkit to be so buggy...
[22:24:27] <Cork> this is insain >_<

[22:57:35] <tw2113> single page scrolling
[22:57:43] <tw2113> very popular
[22:57:52] <tw2113> i get to do one soon, once i get a quote done for it
[23:06:29] <rhino_> if I have 3 divs inside of a div like so.  <div id = "test"><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>.  How can I set the value of each individual child div?
[23:07:42] <rhino_> I tried this:  			$('test').next().html(resp[2]);
[23:07:42] <rhino_> 			$('test').next().next().html(resp[3]);
[23:07:42] <rhino_> 			$('test').next().next().next().html(resp[4]);.  but it set all of the child divs to the value of the first statement
[23:08:32] <jrockjiggz> $('#test').each('div', function(){ $(this).html(resp[4]); });
[23:08:43] <jrockjiggz> $('#test').each('div', function(i){ $(this).html(resp[i]); });
[23:10:12] <blendedbychris> jrockjiggz: thanks for your attemp to help… i sorta just gave into a simpler regex
[23:10:23] <blendedbychris> just \.(doc|pdf|zip)$
[23:10:25] <blendedbychris> etc.
[23:10:31] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  tnx, I'll give it a shot
[23:11:49] <Monkeypaws> http://minus.com/mbbAiF3NhP/4f -- anyone wanna give this a look and see if its possible with ajax/jquery?  or am i going about it the wrong way?
[23:14:18] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  do I need to set the value for i?  its not updating the contents, but I'm not getting an error either
[23:15:45] <jrockjiggz> no i is the index value, each interation of element it will increase, started at 0
[23:16:16] <jrockjiggz> inside the each function, add console.log( $(this) ) to see if its selecting anything
[23:16:40] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  where would I be able to see that error?
[23:18:24] <jrockjiggz> rhino_: in console
[23:19:05] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  no errors
[23:21:07] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  when I do the following:  $('med'+ resp[1] + ' div').each('div', function(i){alert(resp[i])});  it doesn't do anything either?
[23:21:16] <jrockjiggz> rhino_: looks like i gave u wrong code, sorry try this http://jsfiddle.net/ZbmFH/
[23:22:57] <Zhy> Is there an easy way (= plugin for firefox or chrome)  to see which js functions are called in a web application, e.g. on ajax load? I don't want to outfit every function with a console log :0 ... oh and it should work on localhost
[23:23:42] <jrockjiggz> Zhy: firebug?
[23:25:23] <Jagan_> hi friends, anyone here?
[23:25:44] <jrockjiggz> hey
[23:26:59] <Zhy> jrockjiggz, where exactly can I see  that in firebug? Under the script tab there are only HTML GET messages
[23:28:53] <jrockjiggz> Zhy: you can see ajax requests in the console if you enable them.. i see you want to trace the javascript from the new data
[23:29:36] <jrockjiggz> what exactly do you want to find out?
[23:30:03] <jrockjiggz> which functions are called? or where the function is?
[23:31:36] <Zhy> which custom functions are called upon the load, for example I see an element is duplicated on ajax load (which shouldn't happen) and I want to see which of my functions are called so that  it narrows down the area I have to search for the unwanted behaviour
[23:31:38] <jael> hmm
[23:32:32] <Zhy> the functions I want to trace aren't necessarily connected to the new data
[23:32:38] <jrockjiggz> you could step through your javascript execution..
[23:32:47] <jrockjiggz> step will still wait for new content
[23:32:59] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  I tried this:  $('#med'+ resp[1] + 'div' > 'div').each( function(i){ $(this).html(resp[i]); });  but still nothing.  I am trying to set the div values to array elements in that order, so...  Any other ideas?
[23:33:18] <rhino_> did I do something wrong?
[23:33:40] <SoulRaven> anyone try to use the new html5 data list with jquery for autocomplete?
[23:34:02] <Zhy> thanks a lot jrockjiggz :)
[23:34:38] <jrockjiggz> rhino_: your selector is selecting each div inside <div id="med1div"></div> to iterate
[23:34:48] <jrockjiggz> Zhy: it worked?
[23:35:42] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  so what does that mean, how do I need to change it?
[23:36:07] <jrockjiggz> rhino: what is your div el like?
[23:36:56] <Zhy> jrockjiggz, if I want to step through I first have to set a breakpoint, right? So I'd have to choose a function that's certainly called in the case I want to examine if I'm not mistaken
[23:37:08] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  here is my div:  <div id = 'med108'>
[23:37:08] <rhino_> 			<div style = 'width:260px;height:20px;background-color:red;float:left;'>1</div>
[23:37:08] <rhino_> 			<div style = 'width:75px;height:20px;background-color:blue;float:left;'>1</div>
[23:37:09] <rhino_> 			<div style = 'width:135px;height:20px;background-color:orange;float:left;'>micrograms (mcg)</div>
[23:37:09] <rhino_> 			<div style = 'width:240px;height:20px;background-color:purple;float:left;'>As needed but not every day</div><br /><br /></div>
[23:37:43] <jrockjiggz> rhino_: don't flood, ?p
[23:37:53] <rhino_> sry
[23:37:55] <jrockjiggz> but your problem lies with$( '#med'+ resp[1] + 'div')
[23:38:02] <jrockjiggz> your last +'div' is incorrect
[23:38:45] <jrockjiggz> with that selector your query is looking for the match: <div id="med108div"> which doesn't exist
[23:39:29] <jrockjiggz> use $('#med'+ resp[1] +' > 'div')
[23:39:39] <jrockjiggz> use $('#med'+ resp[1] +' > div')
[23:41:26] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  one last thing, I need i to start at 1 instead of 0, how can I do that?
[23:42:28] <Jagan_> i need regular expression for "--123" can anyone help me
[23:43:08] <jrockjiggz> add i++ inside the each function before your code
[23:45:15] <rhino_> jrockjiggz:  thank you soo much, you are a lifesaver
[23:45:22] <anli_> Is there a way to make vs not output a thousand of "script block" entries?
[23:45:46] <anli_> Its perhaps a jquery related question, thats why I am asking
[23:45:55] <jrockjiggz> $('#med'+ resp[1] + ' > div').each( function(i){ if(i === 0){ return true } $(this).html(resp[i]); });
[23:47:18] <jrockjiggz> anli_: whatis vs??
[23:47:59] <anli_> visual studio
[23:48:08] <LukeNukem> llOll
[23:48:11] <anli_> Does jquery produce a lot of script blocks?
[23:48:23] <anli_> And what is a script block?
[23:49:09] <Xotix> hi
[23:50:46] <jrockjiggz> anli_: script block would be <script></script>.
[23:51:18] <anli_> jrockjiggz: I agree
[23:51:30] <Xotix> I'm having this: http://screencast.com/t/njkSHDevkbU8 if you hover over it, it slides out. That's done with hide(slide) and show(). the handler is always there, i just added it to the outpopping div so it looks like it is sliding. THe problem is, you notice it, it isn't that smooth. Is it possible to use hide(slide) but show   a part of the div? MAybe i should use animate with position, left?
[23:51:52] <jrockjiggz> anli_: jQuery wouldn't generate script blocks
[23:53:20] <jrockjiggz> Xotix: have you tried hide('slow') ?
[23:53:45] <jrockjiggz> but yea. to show, you would have to use animate
[23:55:14] <Xotix> jrockjiggz: http://tinyw.in/BLrg go there and press show at newsletter 546. The handler is a position: fixed; div. The layer which pops out is a new div with a copy of the handler in it. You'll notice it if you play a bit. So i'd like to remove the handler and don't hide the layer which slides out. i want to slide it until the handler is remaining.
[23:57:53] <jrockjiggz> Xotix: you can unbind a handler
[23:58:11] <jrockjiggz> $('el').unbind('event')
[23:58:38] <Xotix> jrockjiggz: handler was meant in a desining term. If that makes sense.
[23:58:51] <jrockjiggz> hmm, can you make a jsfiddle?
[23:59:02] <jrockjiggz> ?jsfiddle @ Xotix
