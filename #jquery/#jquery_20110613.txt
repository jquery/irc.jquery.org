[00:28:55] <herrherr> hi there
[00:29:43] <herrherr> does anyone know how to make a click event that works both on the iphone and on android? it works with 'tap' (that comes with jquerymobile), but i actually don't need the other 99% of the framework
[00:30:38] <xDROPx> use the source herrherr
[00:31:08] <herrherr> xDROPx I was hoping that there is a faster way than going through the complete source to find the necessary party
[00:31:10] <Cork> herrherr: bind('tap') should work
[00:31:33] <Cork> herrherr: tap is a native event on mobile browsers
[00:32:05] <herrherr> Cork: that's what I tried (http://pastie.org/2059686). This works perfectly fine with jquerymobile, but not without
[00:34:12] <herrherr> touchstart/touchend work without jquerymobile, but they don't have the desired effect
[00:34:15] <Cork> herrherr: interesting (note i've never used jquery on mobile, only pure js)
[00:35:38] <herrherr> Cork: actually I wouldn't mind to leave jquerymobile in there, but there's too much magic happening behind the scenes (ajax for submissions, etc.), and I don't need all that extra functionality
[00:35:58] * Cork nods
[00:36:18] <Cork> should prob sit down add lab a bit with jquery and mobile
[00:36:21] <Cork> haven't had the time yet
[00:41:58] <herrherr> I'm just suprised that nobody ever had the same problems. I've googled all kinds of things and there doesn't seem to be a solution
[00:46:09] <herrherr> the part where 'tap' is added in jquerymobile is pretty easy to find, but it looks quite complicated to rip it out of there
[00:49:48] <v0idless-> is it possible to, some how, dynamically set the css scope of a theme?
[00:56:48] <rguinness> hello, I'm new to jQuery
[00:57:00] <v0idless-> hi rguinness
[00:59:47] <rguinness> I started reading "jQuery in Action". are there any other references that come highly recommended?
[01:03:13] <rguinness> exit
[01:03:48] <patricnordmark> are you new to javascript as well rguinness? In that case I would recommend a book on Javascript as a great complement
[01:04:28] <kmedia> I am new to jquery and trying to create an effect. I want my home page nav to addClass when the page loads and when i click on other navigation buttons, i want the that button to have the new class and remove class from home nav. I have tried to write code but when i the page reloads, it goes back to the home nav. any ideas anyone
[01:05:49] <BlaDe^> How can I check the position of the pages scroll? I want to show a popup but I don't know if to position it above the button, or below
[01:06:04] <BlaDe^>  top: (e.pageY-(20+($('#sharePopup').height()))), <--- that positions it above, always. But I want it to be below if there's no room above
[01:06:51] <Guest66320> Hello, I have a problem with Jquery. I have an $.ajax function and I want to hava a possibility of checking in other (.click function) whether en error occured (I have errors handling in success function). Anyone could help me with that ? :)
[01:07:09] <Predat0r> hi
[01:11:44] <Predat0r> is it possible to save the datepicker state in cookie? i think save the month where I am clicking other pages the month remains the same
[01:13:17] <USvER> Guest
[01:13:39] <USvER> you can write result to a hiden DIV
[01:13:55] <USvER> and on click() show it
[01:15:16] <Guest66320> but I have $.ajax function which checks whether the user has sufficient amount of credits on his account and other click function which makes the button to fadeOut and later fade in with changed content. And I want to make a statement if the user has insufficient amount, than the button does not fadeOut and change content. ...
[01:16:18] <Tallisman> Guest, you do that by using the if statement, you need to check whether he has enough credits or not.
[01:16:39] <USvER> So on ajax succes make all neccesary fadeouts etc....
[01:17:37] <Tallisman> on ajax success and if the user has sufficient credits :)
[01:17:43] <Guest66320> i've tried putting my whole click function inside the success but it doesnt work
[01:17:59] <Tallisman> you can do that.. actually..
[01:18:45] <USvER> you mean qholw body of your click() function?
[01:18:55] <USvER> whole* body
[01:19:16] <Guest66320> yes
[01:19:17] <jayflux> hi all, when using .show() on my P texts it doesnt force the container element down
[01:19:23] <Tallisman> $.ajax(bla, bla, function() { $("the thing you want to be clicked").click(function() { the rest; }); });
[01:20:02] <Tallisman> jayflux, are you sure your css is appropriate?
[01:20:12] <jayflux> yes Tallisman  heres a link
[01:20:16] <jayflux> http://www.eltafans.com/2/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=8&Itemid=112
[01:20:37] <Guest66320> I have $.ajax(blabla,blabla, success function(error){ oh there is an error }else{$('.item').click(function(){blabla })}
[01:20:43] <Guest66320> an it doesnt work :P
[01:20:47] <jayflux> Tallisman: click features benefits and highlight the first picture
[01:21:53] <Tallisman> ah, I see
[01:21:57] <rguinness> sorry, I asked this question earlier, but got knocked off IRC. Are there any other references for jQuery that come highly recommended, besided "jQuery in Action"?
[01:23:03] <BlaDe^> I'm trying to dynamically position my popup depending on scroll position
[01:23:11] <Guest66320> Mabe it does not work because it's whole in function myfunction(datasend){ $.ajax}
[01:23:20] <BlaDe^> I have: var popupHeight = $('#sharePopup').height(); var popupTop = ($(document).scrollTop() >= popupHeight) ? 60 : (e.pageY-(20+popupHeight));
[01:23:34] <BlaDe^> but that doesn't work if the window is scrolled down
[01:23:54] <jayflux> any ideas then Tallisman
[01:23:59] <USvER> Guest read Tallisman tip... his code will lead you to the right solution!
[01:24:27] <Tallisman> i'm looking at the css atm jayflux :)
[01:24:33] <jayflux> ok tar
[01:27:42] <jayflux> Tallisman: I think the parent div is display hidden
[01:28:27] <Tallisman> I don't think so, the problem is that the div shows, but it doesn't influence the page height?
[01:29:52] <Guest66320> but my syntax is the same ...
[01:30:08] <Tallisman> could you post an example guest? :P
[01:30:20] <Tallisman> (jsfiddle, pastebin, etc)
[01:30:24] <USvER> y rly
[01:30:54] <Guest66320> $.ajax({blabla,blabla, success: function(error){ oh there is an error }else{$('.item').click(function(){blabla })})};
[01:32:19] <Tallisman> jayflux, your problem with the page height is caused by the float you use to align it to the right, I think.. floats really float on top of the page, they do not have influence on any part of the page (unless multiple elements are floated)
[01:32:26] <Guest66320> code works because when the click functuion and $.ajax function are separated they work... but I have to "merge" them in order to check the condition I need
[01:33:13] <Tallisman> okey.. moment
[01:34:46] <Briareos1> I have a slideDown() menu which "flickers" in FF 4.0.1  in a way that I cannot reach the sub-menu items. when I run the cursor down to the first sub-item, the whole menu disappears (rolls back up). anybody having the same problem ? (i suppose so)
[01:35:28] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/6eLSe/ : guest
[01:36:37] <Tallisman> probably a problem in your syntax Briareos1?
[01:36:47] <Guest66320> could it be possible that It is not working because It's insife a function ? (button has onclick function which runs a function lets say myfunction inside that there is an $.ajax and this click function
[01:37:57] <USvER> Reassigning onclick function in itself is not a problem.... (right :D?)
[01:39:25] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/6eLSe/3/ <-- inception?
[01:39:38] <USvER> Ah you not assigned any onclcik function that's why it's no t working for you
[01:40:10] <Tallisman> btw, those examples will not work.. this is because $.ajax in jsfiddle is kinda, notreallythere.
[01:41:05] <Guest66320> assigned onclick function ? :O
[01:41:36] <USvER> you tri to assign function to onclick event on some object in DOM tree right?
[01:41:55] <Guest66320> yes
[01:42:02] <USvER> but you doing it in the function itself?
[01:42:16] <Guest66320> yes whole inside this function
[01:42:19] <USvER> then this function will be never executed
[01:42:57] <Guest66320> but the whole code is working. because when I hit the button and refresh the page it says that it worked
[01:43:05] <Guest66320> but the click function does not work
[01:43:17] <USvER> function can't execute itself.....
[01:43:20] <jayflux> Tallisman: a div floating wouldnt affect the content not stretching
[01:43:56] <Guest66320> so this solution wont work I guess :P
[01:43:57] <Tallisman> if the div floating is the content.. it would :P
[01:44:35] <jayflux> no its the overflow:hidden on the parent div causing it, i checked on firebug
[01:45:08] <Tallisman> O.o, Sorry, I did not expect that one.
[01:45:51] <USvER> guest
[01:45:55] <USvER> run this
[01:45:56] <USvER> http://jsfiddle.net/FZgJS/
[01:46:03] <USvER> And click...
[01:46:04] <jayflux> how would you fix the problem you described anyway Tallisman
[01:46:49] <Guest66320> yes it works
[01:47:09] <Guest66320> but I still need this onclick function outside in order to pass additional argument to my url
[01:47:26] <Tallisman> there isn't an easy fix for floating jayflux :P
[01:48:35] <Tallisman> I try to avoid floating as much as possible, as it renders your page much harder to maintain :P
[01:49:54] <USvER> http://jsfiddle.net/FZgJS/2/
[01:51:40] <Tallisman> USvER :P, when my classmates are bored.. they are comparing browsers in speed :P
[01:51:53] <Tallisman> checking what browser is the fastest, want to see? ^^
[01:52:17] <USvER> how?
[01:52:25] <Tallisman> http://iamfromtheinternet.nl/
[01:52:41] <Tallisman> >.<, That is what happens if people are bored XD
[01:53:03] <USvER> xD
[01:53:06] <USvER> No way
[01:53:13] <USvER> IE cant be that fast!
[01:53:15] <Tallisman> pretty much xD
[01:53:42] <Tallisman> IE is an atom if it spins fast :P
[01:54:35] <USvER> Hm.... Chrome is a spider )
[01:54:39] <macheleon> jqueryui datepicker: how to use multiple datepicker fields in one page?
[01:55:02] <macheleon> if I simply switch from id to class selector, it defaults to open
[01:55:16] <Tallisman> hmm
[01:55:27] <USvER> Safari is..... well.... Compass
[01:56:21] <Tallisman> macheleon -
[01:56:39] <Tallisman> Datepicker in jquery ui 1.7.1 does not allow multiple date picking
[01:56:54] <macheleon> that'd be the problem then :)
[01:57:02] <Tallisman> But there is a plugin available that does enable it.
[01:57:04] <macheleon> I have a page with an earlier version, I'll use that
[01:57:07] <donCams> hi there
[01:57:36] <Tallisman> http://dubrox.blogspot.com/2010/09/multiple-dates-picker-for-jquery-ui.html <-- macheleon, I haven't tried it though.
[01:57:56] <Tallisman> hi donCams
[01:58:02] <Briareos1> Tallisman: cannot see any error. this is only the JS part, but maybe you can see if anything is wrong: http://pastebin.com/g2C7rWdT ?
[01:58:31] <macheleon> cool Tallisman, thanks
[01:58:34] <donCams> i need a sort of carousel where I'll put icons in it. but I do not need the arrows, I want it to be like scrollShow but instead of clicking arrows, I will click and drag to scroll
[01:58:39] <donCams> is there such a plugin?
[02:00:50] <Ely^> hi sean`
[02:01:23] <Tallisman> I don't see why you are using the stop(); function actually - Briareos1
[02:01:48] <Tallisman> (or why you are using find(); :P)
[02:02:49] <Tallisman> donCams.. I don't know about such a plugin no..
[02:03:33] <Tallisman> you could create it yourself though, always fun to make that kind of things ^_^, but I'll look around.. moment
[02:03:34] <USvER> donCams look at this http://www.openstudio.fr/jquery/
[02:03:35] <donCams> crap! and I suck at javascript
[02:04:05] <Tallisman> Is that a carrousel :P?
[02:04:53] <USvER> Shity carrousel )
[02:05:05] <donCams> USvER, something like that
[02:05:17] <donCams> but I want the images to snap, like this http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollShow/
[02:05:27] <donCams> then no need for scroll bars
[02:05:46] <donCams> the user just need to click+drag on the carousel
[02:06:06] <BlaDe^> in a click event on a button I want to display a popup above, or below the button depending on the scroll position. What vars should I use to do this? there's lots.. like innerHeight, scrollY, screenY, etc..
[02:06:08] <USvER> Dude... Can't help you with that
[02:06:11] <donCams> just like when you flip on iPhone
[02:06:18] <donCams> figured... T_T
[02:06:21] <USvER> You shuld do it yourself if you desperately nead it
[02:06:43] <Guest66320> USvER as far I have such a code and the click does not work
[02:06:44] <Guest66320> http://jsfiddle.net/FZgJS/3/
[02:07:36] <Tallisman> It kinda does work :P
[02:07:36] <USvER> hm it's actualy working there
[02:08:04] <Tallisman> but I guess your implementation is slightly different?
[02:08:05] <Guest66320> sorry i forgot this <a> is inside "myitem" class
[02:08:13] <Tallisman> aah :)
[02:08:29] <Guest66320> I have this but forgot to put it inside jsfiddle
[02:09:52] <Briareos1> Tallisman: I do not have any ID's to fetch for - the stop is to prevent the animation to complete when the user switches to a different menu item
[02:10:00] <Tallisman> @donCams
[02:10:01] <Tallisman> http://codecanyon.net/item/3d-carousel-advanced-jquery-carousel/full_screen_preview/136996
[02:10:17] <Guest66320> the alert in success function works fine but this click function does not  (no fading etc)
[02:10:26] <Tallisman> http://codecanyon.net/item/3d-carousel-advanced-jquery-carousel/136996)
[02:10:44] <donCams> thanks Tallisman, guess i'll have to code it myself... don't need it to be 3D :)
[02:11:03] <Tallisman> hehehe (I like it though)
[02:11:24] <USvER> Guest
[02:11:26] <donCams> yes, looks cool :P
[02:11:41] <USvER> Cant see what you are talking about
[02:11:47] <Guest66320> :P
[02:11:54] <cos_> hey
[02:11:58] <USvER> Look at the link you provided...
[02:12:03] <cos_> i've got a 2nd question
[02:12:15] <Tallisman> wb cos_ ^^
[02:12:16] <cos_> yo tallisman
[02:12:27] <cos_> do you use ben alman's bbq plugin?
[02:12:32] <cos_> thanks :D
[02:12:33] <Guest66320> http://jsfiddle.net/FZgJS/4/
[02:12:37] <Guest66320> now it's working ? :P
[02:13:04] <Tallisman> I don't really use plugins :P, not that massive at least :)
[02:13:25] <Tallisman> only when I have no clue how to code it hahahaha
[02:13:44] <cos_> well, jquery script
[02:14:02] <USvER> Tallisman look at the Guest's code xD
[02:15:24] <nexera> Guys I need to clone password fields and turn them into text fields. This partially works but errors on IE. $('input[type=password]').clone().attr('type', 'text'). So Im thinking of grabbing the html() and gsubing it, but that'll be ugly. Just wondering if theres a nicer way?
[02:19:38] <Guest66320> why it's so bad ? ;p
[02:20:19] <jayflux> Tallisman: it deffo has nothing to do with floating, if you unfloat everything it still cuts it off
[02:21:37] <yacc> Sigh, any idea what could cause resizable not to work (it does not show the handles either, but the ui-resizable class is set), while draggable has a tendency to get stuck in dragging?
[02:22:05] <cos_> solved my problem
[02:22:11] <Tallisman> :)
[02:22:19] <cos_> cya later . have a nice day all
[02:22:21] <jayflux> Tallisman:  the height was hardcoded into the parent
[02:22:28] <jayflux> which is annoying as i can't adjust that grr]
[02:22:36] <Tallisman> why not :P?
[02:23:26] <Tallisman> remember there is also a property called min-height: ; :P
[02:23:28] <jayflux> im on a cms, the code for that comes from  a module / plugin, i will have to go deep into it to find some source
[02:24:00] <Tallisman> *we have to go deeper* sorry :P
[02:25:11] <jayflux> no problem lol
[02:29:03] <LiYong> hi
[02:35:06] <USvER> Guest66320 here?
[02:35:39] <Guest66320> y
[02:36:02] <USvER> i'm tracked down your issue to: not getting executed onclick
[02:36:08] <USvER> can't say why
[02:36:16] <USvER> it's nead a deeper look
[02:36:57] <Guest66320> why did u hmmm "smiled" when u saw this code ? :P
[02:37:05] <USvER> so when you say onclick="myfunction();" it's not executed onclick
[02:37:30] <USvER> Cos it's bloody messy and too many typos
[02:37:47] <USvER> but i gues you cut it down quickly
[02:37:53] <Guest66320> yep :P
[02:38:12] <Guest66320> I thought mabe about other solution
[02:38:32] <Guest66320> to add waiting instruction inside my .click function
[02:38:48] <Guest66320> and after the "alert" add $('.myitem').stop();
[02:38:48] <USvER> look at this
[02:38:50] <USvER> http://jsfiddle.net/FZgJS/8/
[02:39:22] <USvER> it's not working right?
[02:39:25] <Guest66320> yes
[02:39:47] <USvER> this is the problem you have
[02:40:05] <USvER> it's not jquery related
[02:41:02] <Guest66320> so it's harder than I've expected :P
[02:41:46] <USvER> ok
[02:41:53] <USvER> i found the problem
[02:42:37] <USvER> i will post you answer on pastebin soon
[02:42:52] <Guest66320> pastebin ? :P
[02:43:14] <Guest66320> oh ok :P
[02:43:18] <Guest66320> found it :P
[02:43:57] <Guest66320> sorry USvER can I ask u something on pm ? :P
[02:44:04] <USvER> http://jsfiddle.net/Srp3J/
[02:44:39] <USvER> so basicaly problem was that i tryed to make function in a function

[02:46:23] <senn_> following a guide, I'm trying to check the presence of an existing meta tag using $('meta [property=og:site_name]').length but I keep getting  'uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [property=og:site_name]' in firebug ... how can I check if that meta item is set?
[02:46:25] <USvER> like window.onload=function(){ etc
[02:46:42] <Guest66320> yes
[02:47:10] <Guest66320> and it was the problem ? :O
[02:47:14] <SoulRaven> hi

[03:01:57] <yacc> Ok, got a stupid iquery-ui question => I'm using an <IFRAME> as the background of my app (customer requirement to allow customization), and I've got the impression that resizable is having troubles capturing mouse drag events over the iframe => it resizes smaller fluently, but it resizes bigger only if I drag it really really slow, and with distance 20 it is not growable  at all.
[03:02:05] <dabear> iquery
[03:02:09] <dabear> is that something new?
[03:02:22] <yacc> dabear, ?
[03:02:36] <dabear> Iquery
[03:02:43] <dabear> :)
[03:02:51] <yacc> What's Iquery?
[03:02:55] <markj> your typo
[03:02:56] <markj> ;p
[03:02:57] <dabear> dunno
[03:03:01] <dabear> you wrote it
[03:03:46] <yacc> oops, ;)
[03:04:07] <dabear> ?g jquery resizable

[03:04:30] <yacc> dabear: Does not mention anything about having an iframe as a background?
[03:07:01] <yacc> The only way that I can think off would be having an invisible div below the form div, and make that auto-resize, *scratch-head* (yeah, the user should be able to interact with the background site as well as possible, just putting a fullscreen capturing div is not an option :(
[03:10:01] <daffodil> hi
[03:11:13] <Diverdude> If i have <tr><td>asd</td><td><textarea></textarea></td><td><input type="button".../></td></tr>and a reference to <tr> How can i find the value of the <textarea></textarea> tag?
[03:12:14] <daffodil> I am using jquery tablesorter plug in.By default this table header will move,when you scroll down.How do i make it static?
[03:12:39] <Woet> Diverdude: $("#reference").find("textarea")
[03:13:34] <Diverdude> yep
[03:13:37] <Diverdude> got it
[03:13:39] <Diverdude> thx
[03:14:01] <daffodil> Diverdude:I am using jquery tablesorter plug in.By default this table header will move,when you scroll down.How do i make it static?
[03:14:33] <Woet> daffodil: no need to repeat your question with random nicks in front
[03:14:59] <daffodil> Woet:okay.Give me a answer?
[03:15:23] <daffodil> Woet:No one replied so,i gave a random pick.
[03:16:55] <markj> if no one replies it means no one knows the answer / wants to answer
[03:17:41] <Woet> markj: but he waited a whopping 2 minutes!
[03:17:42] <Woet> unacceptable
[03:17:49] <USvER> dafodil
[03:18:01] <USvER> see the css
[03:18:25] <USvER> there somewhere asignin position absolute to the table header
[03:20:02] <USvER> daffodil: http://htmlbook.ru/css/position
[03:20:49] <Woet> USvER: i don't think someone from india speaks fluent russian
[03:21:23] <USvER> My brain gonna explode =\ ~30 hour awake
[03:21:30] <jayflux> what does eq actually stand for anyway
[03:21:49] <Woet> jayflux: in which context?
[03:22:11] <jayflux> jQuery.eq()
[03:22:22] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:22:31] <Woet> "Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index."
[03:22:39] <Woet> or you mean, what does it stand for? :)
[03:22:47] <jayflux> no
[03:22:47] <jayflux> lol
[03:22:49] <USvER> jayflux mb equal
[03:22:53] <jayflux> i mean what do the letters stand for
[03:22:57] <jayflux> I know what it does
[03:23:01] <USvER> or equvivalet
[03:23:04] <jayflux> ok
[03:23:10] <Woet> equals
[03:23:11] <Woet> yes
[03:24:07] <USvER> Now i nead your help )
[03:24:24] <Woet> USvER: sleeping pills?
[03:24:58] <USvER> i have to iterate over ajax till i will find right answer... how to do it right recursion?
[03:25:35] <Woet> iterate over what from ajax?
[03:25:49] <USvER> iterate over ajax resposes
[03:25:51] <Woet> you mean, have a loop that keeps sending ajax requests until you have the result you want?
[03:25:59] <USvER> y
[03:26:08] <Woet> and what are you trying to achieve?
[03:26:22] <Woet> that sounds like a horrible way to acheive it
[03:26:29] <USvER> there i paginated page
[03:26:54] <USvER> i nead run thru pagination till i find page with neaded content
[03:27:18] <Woet> and why don't you first figure out which page it is, then do 1 ajax request to get it?
[03:27:39] <USvER> there is no way to know it =\
[03:27:49] <USvER> only find
[03:27:55] <Woet> right
[03:28:11] <Woet> so how do you know what to search for?
[03:28:33] <markj> surely you work out what page you need in the server side language
[03:28:38] <USvER> unique ID
[03:28:44] <USvER> somwhere in text
[03:29:09] <Woet> what markj said
[03:29:19] <USvER> i don't have source... it's cross domain requests
[03:29:29] <daffodil> USvER:When i changed it to absolute.Width of header got reduced.
[03:29:29] <USvER> with no api and feed
[03:30:55] <USvER> daffodil play with it... try to set relative...
[03:31:41] <USvER> look in firebug what is exact postion in runtime
[03:32:31] <USvER> So any tips?
[03:32:45] <USvER> On my loop over ajax requests&
[03:34:19] <USvER> too bad =\
[03:34:21] <Woet> you should solve it server side
[03:34:31] <Woet> you do not make the client loop over all kinds of pages
[03:34:35] <Woet> because the backend is badly coded
[03:34:54] <USvER> backend is not mine
[03:35:00] <USvER> and it's shity coded
[03:35:19] <Woet> okay, then tell them to change it or refuse to work with it
[03:35:19] <USvER> but i nead to do my job )
[03:36:01] <USvER> That will never gonna happen ) Both.... i will not give up just cos of some bad designer =\
[03:37:43] <Diverdude> shouldnt this be okay to hook up change event of all textareas in the page: $('textarea').change(function(){console.log("changed")}); ? (located in $(document).ready(function() )
[03:38:22] <Diverdude> hmm okay
[03:38:22] <USvER> As form looks prety normal
[03:38:31] <Diverdude> it works
[03:38:32] <Diverdude> but
[03:38:42] <Diverdude> only when user leaves textarea
[03:38:57] <Diverdude> is it possible to detect as seen as a key is struck in the textarea?
[03:39:13] <Woet> Diverdude: .keyup
[03:39:17] <Woet> instead of .change
[03:39:35] <USvER> look at some event like lostfocus
[03:39:58] <Woet> that would be .blur, but that's not what he wants.
[03:40:25] <Diverdude> it throws a warning: The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless.
[03:40:44] <Diverdude> 		    $('textarea').keyup(function(){console.log("changed")});
[03:41:09] <Woet> 4000 results on google :)
[03:41:18] <USvER> = )
[03:41:25] <Woet> let me see
[03:41:36] <Woet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2639055/getting-the-charcode-property-of-a-keydown-event-should-not-be-used-the-value
[03:42:50] <Diverdude> lo, change charCode -> XcharCode in source jquery-1.X.X.js and everything works OK
[03:42:54] <Diverdude> not very nice
[03:42:56] <Diverdude> lol
[03:43:04] <Woet> true
[03:43:09] <USvER> So my plan is to make recursion of ajax call store the finded result and return. Is this exceptable?
[03:43:26] <Diverdude> i hope it will be corrected in future version
[03:43:26] <Woet> if you mean acceptable, no, USvER, it's not.
[03:43:32] <daffodil> USvER:should,i add any thing else for css to maintain the widht?
[03:43:36] <Woet> Diverdude: i'm not sure whether it's an error on firebug's side or jquery
[03:43:47] <Woet> does it give an error in the console of safari/chrome too?
[03:44:20] <USvER> daffodil: can't tell dude you must figure out by yourself
[03:44:45] <Diverdude> no it does not
[03:44:49] <Diverdude> must be firebug then
[03:44:52] <Woet> yup
[03:44:53] <daffodil> USvER::) thanks for your help
[03:44:58] <Woet> so dont make that change
[03:44:59] <Woet> :P
[03:45:03] <USvER> daffodil: np
[03:46:50] <Lachezar> Hello all. I can't get the Autocomplete to work, and I can't find what I did wrong...
[03:47:55] <Lachezar> I am seeing lots of JS warning about undefined 'searching', 'expando', and similars.
[03:53:58] <Lachezar> Doh! Scratch that! I was using the wrong source...
[03:58:39] <daffodil> USvER:This is the plug in tablesorter.com which i am using.Can you pls take a look a find which code to make it static?
[04:01:02] <USvER> Did you look here?
[04:01:10] <USvER> http://tablesorter.com/docs/#Examples
[04:01:27] <USvER> There is no absolute header positioning at al
[04:01:50] <USvER> So i gues there is some bug in your css
[04:02:03] <USvER> Like not reseted float or somethin
[04:06:09] <pratz_> hey guys i am getting this error var data = [u&#39;prathameshn@leosys.in&#39;]
[04:06:31] <pratz_> u&#39; what are these char's ??
[04:07:07] <daffodil> USvER:in that eg too,they have written css for dynamic header
[04:09:05] <USvER> "in that eg too" what do you mean? you have moving header on examples page?
[04:10:10] <daffodil> USvER:yes.I want header to be static.
[04:10:14] <USvER> pratz_: http://www.degraeve.com/reference/specialcharacters.php
[04:10:34] <USvER> daffodil: but i see all static at examples page
[04:10:56] <USvER> so this is a bug or somethin of that plugin
[04:11:06] <daffodil> USvER:Those tables are with les data
[04:11:38] <daffodil> USvER:Can you take a look at that plug in script and tell me,i can do this or not
[04:12:07] <USvER> they larger than my screen and not "dynamic"
[04:12:28] <USvER> what browser do you use

[04:15:53] <USvER> just tested in firefox...
[04:16:07] <USvER> no absolute positioning
[04:16:43] <USvER> and documentation say nothin about "floating headers"
[04:17:29] <daffodil> USver:waht is the solution?pal
[04:17:32] <USvER> So... i can't help you dude... it's dead end you say you have float and i don't have....
[04:18:03] <USvER> solution is to ask your friends help
[04:18:27] <USvER> or abondon this idea... cos of lack of experiance...
[04:18:57] <USvER> i think this is CSS issue
[04:19:14] <USvER> try to make clean page only with table nad this plugin
[04:19:37] <USvER> without styling etc
[04:19:47] <USvER> only native plugin css's
[04:19:56] <USvER> and js
[04:21:34] <amirite> should i just use jquery ui's dialog widget for a growl-like notification system or is there something better
[04:22:12] <Suhana> amirite: I like purr myself -- http://kitchen.net-perspective.com/open-source/purr/
[04:22:17] <daffodil> USver:I removed postion:absolute.I want to make header static.any other code could help me.
[04:22:44] <amirite> i want something absolutely lightweight
[04:24:02] <USvER> daffodil: dude i can't do it for you... you must figure it out... just track down the issue...
[04:24:23] <daffodil> USver:okay
[04:24:32] <USvER> daffodil: with clean environment you will know is this plugin or your intrusion
[04:24:50] <USvER> daffodil: it will take a couple of minutes to know
[04:25:01] <USvER> and then decide use it or not
[04:26:03] <daffodil> USver:I have implemented many features to it.moving to new plug in will make me rework on every thing
[04:27:17] <USvER> So you know about this floating header...? and you just want to rewrite this in plugin? maybe contact author for that...
[04:27:49] <daffodil> USver:hey i need it now,contacting authour will not help me.

[06:05:54] <tomtomdie> What lightbox plugin do you guys prefer?

[06:08:14] <tomtomdie> thanks markj:  anyone else have any suggestions?
[06:08:20] <markj> success only fires if there is no error, complete fires every time

[06:10:51] <Diverdude> how can i iterate all hidden input fields on the page having id starting with 'vote' ?
[06:13:45] <Diverdude> ??
[06:15:48] <MrNibbles> Diverdude: $("div[id^=vote]")
[06:16:11] <MrNibbles> if you have a common parent i suggest you use that as the base
[06:16:21] <Diverdude> hmm yes ok
[06:16:58] <Diverdude> if the fields have been added dynamically like this: $('#rph').append('<input....      they dont seem to be available. How do i get them=?
[06:17:13] <daffodil> USver:you there?
[06:17:31] <MrNibbles> Diverdude: they will be, ensure your only performing that selector after the dom insertion
[06:17:42] <MrNibbles> Diverdude: refer to this for selector usage: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:17:49] <USvER> daffodil: yes
[06:18:17] <daffodil> USver:I could not find solution for that fixed header.pal
[06:18:30] <USvER> daffodil: sad
[06:19:20] <daffodil> USver:what to do?Have you implemented previous and next for images or files using jquery
[06:20:08] <Diverdude> hmm, they should be available like this: console.log($("#rph").find('input'));   right?
[06:20:15] <USvER> daffodil: what do you mean? for images there is planty of LightBox like plugins...
[06:20:27] <Diverdude> they were added like this: $('#rph').append('<input name="vote'+data.id+'" id="vote'+data.id+'" type="hidden" value="'+data.id+'_'+data.rate+'">');
[06:20:45] <daffodil> USver:I do not want to use any plug ins
[06:20:54] <alket> How to make a variable of div topmargin ?
[06:21:37] <Diverdude> MrNibbles, problem is nothing is returned
[06:21:43] <daffodil> USver:Did you take a look at that tablesorter plug-in.I mean source code of that plug-in.May be you could find it.
[06:21:59] <Diverdude> MrNibbles, But i know the fields are actually added, because they are sent to the server upon submit
[06:22:13] <tumor> Im trying to replace div.table-cell with a td. http://jsfiddle.net/6qWga/ This seems to work elsewhere, but on IE7 the new nodes are inserted into the DOM but are invisible (the whole point of the exercise is to compensate for lack of display: table-cell on IE7). Cany anyone see what the hell is wrong?
[06:22:29] <USvER> daffodil: nope i'm not looket at it....
[06:22:41] <USvER> daffodil: cos it's pointless
[06:22:41] <walid> hey guys
[06:22:48] <daffodil> USver:Do that for me.
[06:22:54] <walid> i'm doing smth wrong using the arrays at some point
[06:23:12] <walid> i want to iterate through the array, can someone help?
[06:23:13] <USvER> daffodil: Sorry dude i'm tired of that
[06:23:28] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/rJgWm/4/
[06:23:45] <walid> either i fill it wrong, or i iterate wrong
[06:24:17] <daffodil> USver:Help me with that prev /next
[06:25:43] <USvER> daffodil: can't understand what you are talking about... that plugin loads data by ajax? and you want him too load it smoothly(by portions)?
[06:26:03] <r3v3rb> afternoon
[06:26:27] <MrNibbles> Diverdude: works fine - http://jsfiddle.net/FT9h2/
[06:26:53] <r3v3rb> is there a way to take a whole div (and its children) and move it into a new div container?
[06:27:22] <r3v3rb> on a click or hover event
[06:27:25] <daffodil> USver:I did not use any plug in for prev/next.i wrote my own script.I ii explain what i am trying to do.I have an img for prev and for next too.if user clicks prev img it takes value and puts in select statement and get me the doc but here when he clicks continously safari is freezing
[06:27:43] <MrNibbles> r3v3rb: http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[06:27:48] <r3v3rb> ;)
[06:27:52] <r3v3rb> i'll take a look
[06:28:29] <Diverdude> MrNibbles, i believe it is my own fault. I apologize
[06:29:05] <MrNibbles> Diverdude: no problem, good luck, check the order that your selectors are being processed
[06:29:50] <daffodil> USver:got my problem.dude
[06:30:08] <r3v3rb> kind of MrNibbles, unfortuantely i need to do this with 9 different divs each swapping in and out based on click
[06:30:14] <USvER> daffodil: hurrey
[06:30:30] <daffodil> USver:s
[06:30:51] <USvER> daffodil: what was that?
[06:31:22] <MrNibbles> r3v3rb: detach is the best option, you can store the returned elements in a variable and place them anywhere in the dom
[06:31:26] <daffodil> USver:i told yes
[06:31:49] <MrNibbles> r3v3rb: you will also need http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/ or append
[06:31:59] <USvER> daffodil: what was the problem dude?
[06:34:10] <daffodil> USver:any idea how to disable that click event until my doc loads
[06:36:26] <USvER> daffodil: you can unbind onclick function
[06:36:47] <USvER> daffodil: and after ajax is done() rebind it
[06:37:03] <alket> How to get the marginTop as variable, something like this: var Top = $("#div").marginTop();
[06:38:54] <USvER> daffodil:$('.nav').unbind('click', handler);$.ajax({blablabla}).done(function(){$('.nav').bind('click', handler);});
[06:41:38] <USvER> alket .css() function shuld work
[06:42:10] <binne> Is there any reason $('#tgt', window.opener).html('...'); would work but not $('#tgt', window.opener).load('...');
[06:43:24] <binne> Sorry - .load won't work if I window.close the current popup thereafter.
[06:47:03] <binne> Like this:

[06:47:33] <r3v3rb> can someone show me the light !
[06:47:34] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/ZaAXu/
[06:48:19] <Diverdude> is there a clever way to check if an array contains a certain value in jquery?
[06:48:40] <Diverdude> if i have a=new Array(3,4,2,5,6); and i want to see if a contains 6
[06:48:59] <r3v3rb> clicking any of the nav menu items at the top should change the visibility of the currently shown div and show the newly clicked one, it works but it pops the new into place before removing the old so i get a botched page
[06:49:18] <markj> ?inArray @ Diverdude
[06:49:40] <markj> as the bot isnt here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[06:50:23] <r3v3rb> the other issue is that the rollover effect in the bottom menu is a bit crazy if one is animating it chains the next so it all goes a bit hairy
[06:50:25] <spiky> r3v3rb you have a css problem
[06:50:50] <r3v3rb> spike_uk ?
[06:51:07] <r3v3rb> spiky whats that ?
[06:51:10] <binne> Can anyone explaint his one?  http://pastebin.com/ubtwT151
[06:52:06] <binne> explain*
[06:52:41] <spiky> i need to position absolute your items which will fade in fade out
[06:52:43] <spiky> you*
[06:52:59] <spiky> and wrap them into a container
[06:54:04] <r3v3rb> ok
[06:57:09] <daffodil> USver:even after this safari is freezing
[06:57:27] <r3v3rb> it seems more likely that the jq is firing across them twice - i think i need to set them to shown/hidden whilst switching
[06:57:38] <r3v3rb> i dont know
[06:58:20] <USvER> daffodil: dude if you can't debug it yourself... how can i help you? you think i will abandone all my work and do it for you from scratch?
[06:59:12] <daffodil> USver:cool. you wrote .done is that a method should i use .add()
[07:01:13] <Deele> is it possible to call focus() without triggering any on.focus events?
[07:01:23] <USvER> daffodil: What? Explain? Done is invoked when ajax(deffered object) is done.... add() is Add elements to the set of matched elements.
[07:01:52] <USvER> daffodil: whole different story
[07:02:54] <Deele> nvm, will workaround...
[07:07:05] <daffodil> USver:okay.dude thanks
[07:07:25] <walid> sorry noob question here... if i want to declare a function, but not call it, how do i do?
[07:07:34] <walid> simply declare it before the onReady?
[07:07:40] <USvER> y
[07:07:55] <walid> but then i won't have access to all the variables that are in there, and that i need.
[07:07:55] <USvER> function blabla(parameter){}
[07:08:06] <USvER> where?
[07:08:09] <walid> hm it seems to call it, though.
[07:08:14] <walid> in the onReady
[07:08:33] <USvER> than define vriables globaly
[07:08:56] <walid> hm no way around this?
[07:09:18] <USvER> you can pass variables to function as parameters
[07:09:38] <walid> (cause i coded everything already, and i just realised i needed to call that function in the callback of another, but i'd rather just call f() in the callback, than copy the whole function's body
[07:10:19] <walid> hm. i guess i'll just copy the whole body of the fct to the callback, i don't to change everthing, add arguments, and all ^^
[07:11:15] <USvER> as you wish... if you can do it without function call... than be it )
[07:12:00] <walid> USvER: thanks!
[07:12:00] <USvER> but if you duplicate the function.... it's a truoble
[07:13:23] <beegees> Hi everybody
[07:13:23] <walid> USvER: so far i don't ;)
[07:14:13] <beegees> I would like to create a new div with and id inside
[07:14:21] <beegees> I'm using this code :
[07:14:24] <beegees> var e = $(document.createElement('div')).attr("id","new_pathologie_"+i);
[07:14:39] <beegees> but, it doesn't work
[07:15:18] <USvER> beegees: read about function .add()
[07:15:34] <ocharles> Anyone know anything about $('select').val('somevalue') not doing what I expect in opera 11?
[07:15:40] <ocharles> Works correctly in Chrome
[07:16:21] <beegees> I have to use .add() to add an id ?
[07:17:13] <walid> i use wrap() to wrap elements from a set, then i would on an other event remove this same wrapping, what's the best way to do it?
[07:17:18] <USvER> beegees: try thi $("p").add("div").attr("id","new_pathologie_"+i);
[07:17:37] <beegees> USvER Thank you, I'm testing
[07:18:12] <compact> hi. http://compactdev.com/?page=server_view&id=9 any idea why if I click on WebFTPs it wont load google? wont lot any other pages for the tab
[07:18:17] <compact> only like #tabs-4
[07:18:49] <walid> (ps: what i do is i have a list of elements, i reorder them, wrap each subgroup. then i want that when i order them differently, i unwrap it before calling the sorting function)
[07:21:54] <vladyn> hello everybody
[07:22:09] <beegees> USvER sorry but your code doesn't work
[07:22:31] <beegees> USvER with your code, I will add in any <p> the div
[07:26:54] <walid> i have some elements that might or might not exist, and i'd like to fade them out BEFORE calling the following function, but i want to call that function anyways. how can i do that
[07:27:15] <walid> or rather, how are instructions executed.
[07:27:17] <walid> f1(); f2();
[07:27:28] <walid> does f2 wait for f1 to be finished to start?
[07:28:06] <systemfault> Depends.
[07:28:16] <walid> systemfault: on?
[07:28:29] <stricjux> Hello.
[07:28:30] <systemfault> walid: Some functions are asynchonous in javascript.
[07:28:42] <systemfault> walid: setTimeout.. setInterval and ajax requests.
[07:29:05] <walid> well i use fadeOut(), then quicksand()
[07:29:22] <systemfault> walid: Then probably that fadeOut uses a timer.
[07:29:31] <systemfault> walid: That would make it asynchronous
[07:29:37] <walid> and i need quicksand to wait for fadeOut to finish before it starts
[07:29:51] <walid> hm a timer, you say.
[07:29:54] <systemfault> walid: I think jQuery has something for that.
[07:30:11] <walid> systemfault: well fadeOut has a callback function
[07:30:43] <walid> problem is, if the DOM calling fadeOut doesn't exist, it doesn't call that function
[07:31:01] <systemfault> The DOM doesn't have fadeOut..
[07:31:07] <walid> and it might be that my DOM element doesn't exist.
[07:31:15] <systemfault> walid: Have your tried chaining the 2 calls?
[07:31:22] <walid> hm sorry, not DOM then, but my div
[07:31:41] <walid> like fadeOut( function(){quicksand()})?
[07:31:54] <stricjux> Could somebody please explain how to properly do: $("child").click(function(){do_something();$("parent").click(function(){do_something_else();})); (example structure: <div id="parent">I'm parent.<div id="child">I'm child</div></div>; Currently both do_something and do_something_else fire if I press on the child.
[07:32:08] <walid> $aDiv.fadeOut( function(){$anotherDiv.quicksand()})?
[07:32:56] <quicksilver> stricjux: you need to return false if you don't want the event to be handled by other handles.
[07:32:58] <walid> stricjux: try:
[07:33:07] <quicksilver> stricjux: A click on the child *is* also a click on the parent.
[07:33:14] <walid> $("child").click(function(){do_something();}); $("parent").click(function(){do_something_else();}));
[07:33:15] <stricjux> I understand
[07:33:35] <USvER> beegees: sorry for so long
[07:33:39] <walid> systemfault: any clue?
[07:33:44] <stricjux> but I want to add the new click handler only after the child function fires.
[07:33:54] <USvER> beegees: try this $("body").append('<div id="cool"></div>');
[07:34:14] <walid> stricjux: then simply bind it to a click? or is it strictly the same? (sry just asking here)
[07:34:53] <systemfault> walid: myElement.fadeOut(the_time, function() { call the second function here}) //I think
[07:35:12] <systemfault> I don't play much with the effects..
[07:35:22] <walid> systemfault: what if myElement doesn't exist? :(
[07:35:43] <systemfault> walid: You're calling a function on a non-existing element?!
[07:35:45] <walid> systemfault: hm ok
[07:35:59] <stricjux> Scenario: I display a popup (parent div) with a button (this is the child div). After pressing the button, I change the text in the popup, but I want the popup to be reactive to any click so I can hide it.
[07:36:02] <systemfault> Why would you fade something you're not even sure it exists?
[07:36:02] <walid> http://vbbros.net/d6/projects
[07:36:12] <stricjux> from that point onwards
[07:36:22] <stricjux> (from the click onwards)
[07:36:36] <walid> systemfault: try program, and such. if i click on program, it groups my elements by type. if i click on a subcategory, it doesnt
[07:36:48] <walid> so the 'group-title' might not exist.
[07:37:35] <walid> and quicksand(my sorting plugin), doesn't work well if the content is in multiple divs. you get it?
[07:38:30] <walid> so basically i need to unwrap my list from the grouping fields, remove the titles, and THEN call quicksand
[07:38:33] <walid> you get it?
[07:39:22] <CrisO> stricjux: Bind on the parent div and look at the ev.currentTarget (http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/) to see if the click came from the button or from anywhere else in the popup
[07:39:24] <systemfault> That code is weird :(
[07:39:29] <systemfault> Not even valid html..
[07:39:50] <walid> html code, you mean?
[07:39:56] <walid> i think it is
[07:40:05] <walid> you mean the data-type= * ?
[07:40:08] <systemfault> When <li>s in <div>s?
[07:40:21] <systemfault> s/When/With
[07:40:46] <systemfault> Perhaps you should try to find someone who knows the quicksand plugin :/
[07:41:11] <walid> hm that's right
[07:41:16] <walid> i'l change that
[07:41:32] <walid> can i have smth lik <ul> <ul> <li>
[07:41:34] <walid> ?
[07:41:57] <walid> cause i do have this ONE list, and in the end i just want to wrap some elements inside of it.
[07:43:30] <stricjux> CrisO, tried, but currentTarget doesn't change if I click in the parent or on the child.
[07:44:37] <stricjux> CrisO, also, I would like to bind the method to <body> or (document) so, that the new click handler is bound everywhere the user clicks.
[07:50:14] <stricjux> CrisO, walid, systemfault : current hack is to wrap the second click() into setTimeout(function(){...click()..},1); but I'd really like to find something cleaner. Also, setting the child .bind() function with false does nothing to prevent the second click from firing.
[07:50:16] <r3v3rb> spike changed the position absolute but still getting a bounce when clicking between menu items
[07:50:17] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/ZaAXu/2/
[07:50:36] <CrisO> stricjux: my bad... event.srcElement works - http://jsfiddle.net/pJgyu/11749/
[07:50:41] <r3v3rb> brain is frazzled
[07:50:46] <r3v3rb> cannot compute
[07:50:57] <r3v3rb> why its looping twice
[07:53:33] <rasmus78> Hi, I am having a problem with clone in combination with find: I am doing     var entry = $("#restaurantMenuDiv").find("#someIdHere")[0];
[07:53:37] <rasmus78> and then entry.clone() - does not work
[07:53:53] <rasmus78> someone knows how to do this correctly?
[07:54:49] <CrisO> stricjux: apparently ev.target is more "browser proof" - same idea though
[07:55:13] <r3v3rb> anyone have two minutes to spare looking at that fiddle?
[07:56:27] <AdvoWork> hi there, im doing:  submitdata : function() { return {foo : 2, bar: "something"};	}  but need the 2 and the something to reference html 5 data-attributes. is this possible? i need to send more than just the name, id, value across to something..
[07:57:47] <Jon47> r3v3rb - your link hrefs are # (which is good, valid html5) but what that means is that when you click those links, and your click event propagates up to the top of the DOM, the hash value "#" gets sets in the URL bar
[07:58:03] <Jon47> since there is no empty hash anchor, it pops you to the top of the viewport
[07:58:22] <Jon47> you can fix this by prevent the default actions of the click event or stopping its propagation
[07:58:28] <NL_Ed> Hi all, can someone give me a hand on the multislect
[07:58:49] <Jon47> i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/ZaAXu/3/
[07:58:58] <r3v3rb> jon will that stop the double fade ?
[07:59:28] <Jon47> no your custom click event handler will still run, it will only prevent the default actions of clicks on an "a" tag that the browser has
[08:00:23] <r3v3rb> sure, i knew i had to add that - the problem I have is that the click event runs and fades the clicked element and the existing element twice
[08:00:53] <r3v3rb> what I am trying for is to get the current shown item to disappear, then the newly clicked item to fade in
[08:04:41] <Jon47> r3v3rb in your example nothing really seems to fade in or out for me..
[08:04:54] <Jon47> i can click on the links in the header but.. nothing much happens..
[08:04:54] <r3v3rb> no, if you got to version 1 it works
[08:04:56] <r3v3rb> ;)
[08:05:06] <Jon47> ah i see
[08:05:28] <AdvoWork> if ive got <input type="text" id="abc" name="abc" data-id="xyz"> how can I use jquery to get data-id?
[08:05:40] <r3v3rb> when going -> safe -> vault - safe the third safe bounces...
[08:06:33] <jrock20041> In jQuery is it possible to get the date of the third wendnesday of the month?
[08:06:41] <NL_Ed> Does anybody know a problem with the UI Multiselect where it posts values twice
[08:07:46] <Jon47> r3v3rb you probably want to pass parameters to the stop method, for one thing
[08:08:01] <r3v3rb> Jon47, such as?
[08:08:04] <Jon47> http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[08:08:13] <Jon47> depends on what effect you're trying to achieve
[08:08:23] <Jon47> but from what I understand, .stop(true) probably would work
[08:08:29] <Jon47> for your case..
[08:10:28] <r3v3rb> Jon47 thats another issue ;) my main one is when clicking an item in the menu at the top...
[08:11:05] <r3v3rb> if you click it a second time the event shows it then fades it out then finally shows it again
[08:11:14] <plug918> hello, what would be the cloeset() method in jquey 1.2 versoin?
[08:14:40] <AdvoWork> this.id  holds the id of my input element, so how come: $(this.id).attr("data-id") is undefined, if ive got: <div class="dblclick" style="display: inline; text-align:center;" id="customers_reference4682" data-id="4682">j3</div> ?
[08:15:33] <AdvoWork> ahh got it
[08:15:39] <AdvoWork> '#'+this.id
[08:16:48] <Jon47> r3v3rb in that case you  need to figure out which header item is currently selected, and then not do the animation stuff in the case the the link they just clicked is already highlighted.. this isn't really a jquery problem, it's just scripting
[08:17:49] <ocf> 'llo all
[08:20:48] <r3v3rb> indeed Jon47
[08:20:49] <necromancer> is there a method i can use to check if an event listener is already bound?
[08:20:55] <r3v3rb> already on it
[08:21:22] <r3v3rb> although isn't this the channel to ask about jquery scripting issues?
[08:21:37] <necromancer> like if i have $('#myElement').click(myFunction); bound already, can I check if a.) there's already a click action on #myElement and b.) that click action is bound to the function myFunction()?
[08:21:39] <shesek> AdvoWork, no, just use $(this)
[08:21:51] <shesek> AdvoWork, no need to find it by ID when you already have the DOM element
[08:22:59] <Jon47> necromancer you'll have to mess w/ jquery internals but oyu can do it
[08:23:27] <Jon47> it might have changed in recent versions but at one point you could do it by accessing ..
[08:23:27] <Jon47> yourElement.data('events') I believe
[08:25:39] <mayersd> Hi I'm wondering whether there is a way, in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/pFDPd/ , where I can keep all the elements in place and when the mouse is over the element with ".container" then ".pContainer" is displayed. However, I want it displayed over ".otherContent". right now it is moving the lements down to display it. ?
[08:30:22] <halcyon1234> I'm having issues with .wrap(). I suspect it's my understanding of the function.  jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/g2aHk/1/
[08:30:23] <halcyon1234> Summary:  D1.wrap(D2); D2.wrap(D3); // D3 does not get entered into DOM, but D2 does
[08:34:53] <nguyendh> how do i count the number of tabs in jquery ui ?
[08:36:20] <halcyon1234> @nguyendh: Can you do $("ul.ui-tabs-nav>li").length ?
[08:37:27] <nguyendh> that works. thx. is it in the jquery ui documentation ?
[08:38:19] <halcyon1234> Nope, that's just jquery. I'm finding the tab, then counting up each li in the element.
[08:38:43] <nguyendh> halcyon1234, is it possible to insert the tab after a specific tab ?
[08:38:51] <quentin> hi folks. I am currently using $("a[rel='archives2']").livequery(function(){ ... for my fancybox call. Can I also base this call on the class tag? It is important to have all the elements with that class showing up in the same fancybox (like the rel does).
[08:38:59] <nguyendh> i have 3 tabs, when i add new tab, i want my new tab behind 1st tab.
[08:41:48] <halcyon1234> Look into .insert or .before, see which one is best for you
[08:42:32] <pattisahusiwa> #php
[08:43:03] <nguyendh> halcyon1234, insert and before as in jquery context ? (not jquery ui, as I am aware there is an 'add' event that will create a tab)
[08:43:27] <necromancer> Jon47: thanks i'll play around with that
[08:43:59] <necromancer> oh sweet it worked :0
[08:44:00] <necromancer> :)*
[08:47:20] <Jon47> necromancer: note that it will only work for event handlers bound by jquery, if you use any other libraries, or are binding them with native js, this method won't work
[08:49:48] <mayersd> I'm wondering whether there is a way, in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/pFDPd/ , where I can keep all the elements in place and when the mouse is over the element with ".container" then ".pContainer" is displayed. However, I want it displayed over ".otherContent". right now it is moving the lements down to display it. ?
[08:52:26] <pattisahusiwa> my some code not work in internet explorer 6, any advice for me?
[08:53:43] <Jon47> pattisahusiwa, i have some advice, describe the specific issue in detail, it's impossible to help you right now given the information you've provided
[08:55:29] <ch3mical> Finally switch from crappy pidgin irc client
[08:55:33] <ch3mical> switched*

[08:55:51] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, i'm using crappy pidgin client at work - what did you switch to?
[08:55:52] <necromancer> Jon47: yeah i figured. that's okay, we use strictly jQuery here :)
[08:55:57] <pattisahusiwa> i have some div in one page that i set hide (display:none), but in internet explorer 6, just first div that i can show with .toggle. another div not work. so?
[08:56:14] <ch3mical> geekbuntu_: I found a port of Xchat (free one, not the "official" shareware one)
[08:56:23] <ch3mical> http://www.silverex.org/download/
[08:57:19] <ch3mical> So far it's definitely better than pidgin
[08:57:55] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, that's what i use at home - it's ok so far (like you say), but i keep holding out for something that isn't so heavy
[08:58:09] <ch3mical> Yeah
[08:58:29] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, i hate to think about a command line client, but i may have too
[08:58:42] <ch3mical> I just wish they would let me install linux over this crap and just run win in a vm when needed ;p
[08:58:53] <geekbuntu_> that's how i'm talking now
[08:59:03] <geekbuntu_> work on ubuntu - rdp into windows box
[08:59:16] <ch3mical> Nice
[08:59:48] <geekbuntu_> mayersd, did you figure it out?
[09:00:21] <ch3mical> Trying to find a font that doesn't suck..
[09:01:02] <ch3mical> ooo comic sans... *barf*
[09:02:01] <captsisko> what's the correct format when using contains?
[09:03:48] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, it's not the most creative way to find a font, but i have been looking at premium css3 templates - view source/follow the trail of any fonts i like to the copyright holder - see if it's ok to use it
[09:03:55] <geekbuntu_> but i have to love the hell out of it to do all that work
[09:04:21] <ch3mical> Yeah lol
[09:04:40] <imanc> hey - if jquery has been set up like this:
[09:04:41] <imanc> var django = {
[09:04:41] <imanc>     "jQuery": jQuery.noConflict(true)
[09:04:41] <imanc> };
[09:04:51] <ch3mical> geekbuntu_: Have you used google fonts before? I use the Ubuntu font from google fonts on one of my projects
[09:05:09] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, yes, i actually like them
[09:05:12] <imanc> How can I access jquery?    django['jQuery'](document).ready( funct.. ?
[09:05:21] <ch3mical> Agreed
[09:05:24] <geekbuntu_> droid rocks
[09:05:33] <ch3mical> I think it's a great idea to CDN fonts
[09:06:17] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, cdn offers a lot more variety... trying to load all the resources from the hosting site would be draining
[09:06:26] <ch3mical> Exactly
[09:06:48] <humbug> hi! i want to get text, which is shown in the browser window. just what human sees
[09:07:02] <ch3mical> see ?.text

[09:07:02] <geekbuntu_> ch3mical, so much on my to-learn list,.... one of them is css3 graphics (graphic like fixtures)
[09:07:16] <geekbuntu_> srpites
[09:07:16] <ch3mical> geekbuntu_: Yeah, same
[09:07:18] <geekbuntu_> sprites
[09:07:24] <geekbuntu_> o.0
[09:07:27] <geekbuntu_> list never ends
[09:07:47] <ch3mical> lol yeah... well it's good job security if there's always something new to learn/apply
[09:08:06] <ch3mical> Are you a developer professionally?
[09:08:14] <falcom> quick question, how can i access current element's anchor? this>a
[09:08:14] <bot-t> (997 hours ago) <coldhead> tell falcom PUNNNNNNNCH
[09:08:15] <bot-t> (300 hours ago) <coldhead> tell falcom PUNNNNCH
[09:08:15] <geekbuntu_> yes, but getting laid off june 30th
[09:08:21] <ch3mical> oh noes!
[09:08:22] <falcom> ouch
[09:08:34] <geekbuntu_> but.... the good news is i got like 4 interviews next week
[09:08:39] <falcom> @ bot-t and geekbuntu
[09:08:41] <geekbuntu_> and i had 2 last week
[09:08:46] <geekbuntu_> 2 the week before that
[09:08:46] <ch3mical> Cool
[09:08:50] <ch3mical> Good luck man
[09:09:04] <ch3mical> What part of the world are you in?
[09:09:06] <geekbuntu_> thanks - i just want to not go back in debt trying to survive
[09:09:10] <geekbuntu_> syracuse ny
[09:09:18] <humbug> no, not .text(). i want to get text which is beeing seen by user "rigth now". i may draw if you want
[09:09:44] <ch3mical> ?p @ humbug
[09:09:44] <bot-t> humbug, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:10:14] <geekbuntu_> yea... from what humbug said - .text() or .html() are the only options
[09:10:27] <moldy> hi
[09:12:41] <falcom> how can i access the anchor in $(this) ?
[09:13:13] <falcom> usually we can access inner with $('#id .someclass element').... however i can't quote this
[09:14:23] <sisko> falon: i think you want $(this).attr('href')

[09:16:53] <ch3mical> lol
[09:17:06] <falcom> sisko: in my case... $this will be referring to <li> .. and i want to access the <a> in it,
[09:17:09] <humbug> >____>
[09:17:18] <falcom> how could i do this?
[09:17:24] <falcom> can*
[09:17:33] <ch3mical> humbug: nice ASCII art
[09:17:40] <humbug> $(this).childs()
[09:17:44] <humbug> .find()
[09:18:01] <geekbuntu_> it was some decent ascii art
[09:18:02] <humbug> ch3mical thx ^___^
[09:18:31] <humbug> thx ^___^
[09:18:56] <falcom> humbug: ok. can i confirm those are the only way? There's no syntax such as $('#someid .someclass') with a "this" equivalent?
[09:20:47] <humbug> falcom, ask the masters, but i would do that like: $(this).children().filter(".class").each(  f )
[09:21:05] <humbug> may be there is syntax like $(selector, parent)
[09:21:21] <humbug> i am jquery newbie
[09:23:50] <falcom> humbug: thanks,
[09:25:38] <sisko> falcon: try $(this).each(
[09:25:40] <sisko> function($stuff){
[09:25:42] <sisko> $($stuff).find('a');
[09:25:44] <sisko> }
[09:25:45] <sisko> );
[09:25:47] <sisko> That's rough and probably buggy but the best I can think of but hambug's solution is probably better
[09:27:18] <skrewt> Is there a common fix to using datepicker in a modal window?
[09:27:31] <humbug> $(this).find() works fine with tree structure, even if selector returns an array of elements
[09:28:19] <humbug> how can i get that text? -> http://jsfiddle.net/dcsLA/
[09:28:19] <sisko> does any one know of the way to use contains?
[09:29:06] <falcom> humbug: dont think there's a way to obtain only text shown in browser
[09:29:12] <falcom> or the iframe
[09:29:41] <humbug> may be a "super" element with absolute positioin?
[09:30:05] <Brodingo> humbug you could try the viewport selector to possibly narrow down which container is visible
[09:30:22] <Brodingo> ?g jquery viewport selectors

[09:30:43] <falcom> Brodingo: wow that's cool
[09:30:53] <skrewt> oh what the heck
[09:31:00] <skrewt> i cant even use an inline datepicker in a popup?
[09:32:14] <humbug> skrewt i don get it...
[09:32:29] <humbug> Brodingo thanks, i ll try
[09:32:39] <skrewt> im trying to use the jquery ui datepicker inside of a lightbox popup
[09:32:51] <skrewt> its actually TinyBox but its the same thing basically
[09:33:13] <Brodingo> skrewt so are you calling .datepicker() or whatever after your model opens?
[09:33:31] <skrewt> its an iframe modal that loads in an external php page
[09:33:42] <skrewt> and inside that page i am calling .datepicker()
[09:35:56] <imanc> is it OK to dump a load of javascript into a templatetag or is that a django faux pau ?
[09:39:46] <skrewt> anyone got any ideas?
[09:41:30] <djQuery> skrewt: create a fiddle
[09:41:37] <humbug> skrewt  does your page contains script jquery ui ? ....
[09:41:44] <skrewt> yea, i am using the script
[09:41:54] <skrewt> i dont think i can make a fiddle for this one djQuery
[09:42:37] <djQuery> skrewt: sure you could. I have created fiddles with 5 plugins before
[09:42:39] <humbug> <skrewt> its an iframe modal that loads in an external php page   |   is that page you are downloading contains the script?
[09:43:11] <skrewt> yes, jquery and jquery ui are loaded
[09:43:38] <skrewt> when i access the page directly in my browser, it works fine
[09:43:47] <humbug> ah, ok
[09:43:47] <skrewt> however its loaded inside of the modal it does not work
[09:44:03] <humbug> what about debugging?
[09:44:11] <skrewt> i get nothing in console
[09:44:15] <djQuery> skrewt: iframes are da devil
[09:44:17] <skrewt> no errors or anything
[09:44:24] <skrewt> i know they are, but its how these popups work
[09:44:30] <skrewt> lightbox,tinybox, etc
[09:44:41] <humbug> css conflict?
[09:45:11] <skrewt> i personally think its a DOM conflict
[09:45:22] <skrewt> the onFocus event does not fire when its loaded in the modal
[09:45:28] <skrewt> from what i can tell
[09:46:22] <humbug> ahm, can you try another example of calling jquery inside your iframe?
[09:47:19] <djQuery> $('<div></div>').load('url', funciton(){  $(this).lightbox();}).delegate('input[type="date"]:not('.ui-datepicker'), 'focus', function(){$(this).datepicker();});
[09:47:25] <djQuery> skrewt: ^^^^
[09:47:48] <falcom> when you click an anchor that links to "#something"... it should show up in your address bar as blablah.com/#something  .. however http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ demo doesnt do that, how did they do this
[09:48:22] <walid> how can i log a var that is not only text?
[09:48:31] <walid> i would need to print it out...
[09:48:45] <djQuery> falcom: carefully.      $('a').click(fucntion(e){ e.preventDefault();});
[09:48:47] <humbug> use debugging tools
[09:48:57] <walid> it's a $myDiv.find('li')
[09:49:00] <skrewt> djQuery, thank you. looks like i need to tweak it a bit but ill give it a whirl
[09:49:01] <humbug> like firebug
[09:49:07] <humbug> or f12 ie ie
[09:49:21] <falcom> djQuery: thanks much
[09:49:40] <walid> humbug: is there not a simple way to console.log it or smth?
[09:50:18] <humbug> you may, but debuggers provide method\attributes inspection
[09:50:52] <humbug> you may set a braekpoint and watch the variable

[09:51:37] <djQuery> walid: read this ^^^^^
[09:54:04] <wolfehr> hi guys, if i am animating a hoverOn/hoverOut, then the user interrupts, what is the best way to keep the animation fluid based on a new hoverOver while the animation is in progress?
[09:54:22] <Brodingo> queue: false
[09:54:55] <Brodingo> so your animations dont stack up
[09:57:05] <walid> djQuery: cheers. i wanted to see the html contained in the object, but i realize now it doesn't make too much sense anyways.
[09:57:13] <wolfehr> Brodingo, I think I'm trying to do the opposite, keep the animation fluid through each point so it doesn't look jerky
[09:58:09] <wolfehr> as an example, an unordered list with some menu items, on hover on an li, a background image moves to site behing the hovered li from a starting position, if you hover on another li while the animation is in progress, I want it to smoothly continue moving to that new hovered on li
[10:00:02] <wolfehr> I think an important thing to determine is movement speed, not animation speed, but I'm not sure how i'd go about that
[10:01:56] <lrvick> So I have a dialog box that plays a youtube video (click on any ov the video icons on the right side here: http://alpha.tawlk.com/#android ). Problem is that the video is still playing after you close the dialog box. the element is never destroyed. (i can still hear audio playing evne though the box is gone). Ideas?
[10:03:00] <wolfehr> irvick, i had this just recently, make sure you empty the new active window, this will kill the video
[10:03:32] <lrvick> empty it before destroying the box?
[10:03:38] <lrvick> im not sure what you mean
[10:03:54] <wolfehr> $('#myvideo').empty() this will remove the iframe from the page
[10:03:58] <lrvick> http://pae.st/spyP/
[10:04:00] <wolfehr> wherever it is in your isntace
[10:04:06] <lrvick> is the function i have donig i
[10:04:08] <z1000> any suggestions on easiest way to add a sort feature like this ? http://folioway.iwakthemes.com/portfolio/#all
[10:04:17] <lrvick> i need to do it dynamically
[10:04:19] <lrvick> somehow
[10:04:52] <lrvick> woops: http://pae.st/50BU/
[10:04:57] <lrvick> so yeah, thats the function
[10:06:19] <humbug> Brodingo thanx, it workds
[10:06:21] <djQuery> z1000: looks like its just doing some hiding and showing of hidden divs with a higher z-index of the image on hover
[10:06:33] <Brodingo> contgrats
[10:06:42] <z1000> what about #hash value storing proper ones to be shown/hidden in the browser?
[10:08:06] <djQuery> z1000: see ?bbq
[10:08:07] <bot-t> z1000, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[10:08:22] <z1000> ya that thing is not easy to work with :(
[10:10:14] <djQuery> z1000: check his blog he has a stripped down version
[10:10:31] <z1000> have u worked with it or only heard of it
[10:11:03] <humbug> djQuery you are awesome!
[10:11:07] <djQuery> z1000: just read the blog. I havent worked with either.
[10:11:17] <blindMoe> z1000: I have worked with it.. it isn't to hard once you get the hang of it
[10:12:10] <djQuery> ?g hashchange
[10:12:11] <bot-t> djQuery, Ben Alman  jQuery hashchange event - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[10:12:20] <nguyendh> sup blindMoe, glad to see u in this channel
[10:12:28] <djQuery> z1000: theres the stripped down one.
[10:12:49] <blindMoe> nguyendh: not much... I am just about always here :)
[10:12:50] <z1000> but again have u worked with it or just sharing the link
[10:13:06] <Jon47> z1000 you can see a list of other hashchange polyfills here: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills
[10:13:23] <blindMoe> z1000: he said he has not worked with it.. but like I said.. I have worked with BBQ and it is fairly simple once you figure out what you are doing
[10:13:26] <Jon47> if you want to try other options besides Ben Almans.. but he's considered a web hero so you might wanna just go with his
[10:13:41] <z1000> ok cool guys ill do some reading later thanks for the info
[10:13:52] <z1000> appreciate it
[10:14:49] <humbug> bb!
[10:15:09] <z1000> so you think whenever anyone uses #hash stuff its bbq plugin?
[10:15:33] <djQuery> z1000: no they could just be using the hashchange themselves
[10:16:26] <halcyon1234> I have two elements, and when I have a reference to one, I want an easy way to reference the other. (link them).  I'm worried about js memory leaks. Is it better to say $("#e1").attr("assoc_id", "d1");  $("#d1").attr("assoc_id", "e1") --OR-- $("#e1", "assoc_elm", $("#d1"))?
[10:17:01] <humbug> i am loading a data uri image. how can i get its width\heigth?
[10:17:30] <Jon47> humbug - plop it on the page and then check its width/height with jquery .width() / .height() ?
[10:17:44] <djQuery> z1000: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/680785/on-window-location-hash-change
[10:18:33] <djQuery> halcyon1234: how about using data instead
[10:18:46] <astropirate> How can I dynamically add page elements to a jquery mobile page after the page has loaded?
[10:19:21] <halcyon1234> @hambug: There might be a plugin for you. It's been a while since I looked it but, but I think this is it: http://www.foliotek.com/devblog/getting-the-width-of-a-hidden-element-with-jquery-using-width/
[10:19:50] <Jon47> astropirate - there's a #jquerymobile channel
[10:19:51] <halcyon1234> djQuery: Ha, I completely forgot about Data. $("#e1").data("assoc", $("#d1")), right?
[10:20:00] <djQuery> y
[10:20:03] <halcyon1234> Thanks.
[10:20:24] <astropirate> Jon47, yes but unfortunately no one is alive in it :(
[10:20:39] <Jon47> aw bummer
[10:21:06] <humbug> Jon47 that was stupid of me, thanks)
[10:21:24] <LearnerJq> what is the best Jquery validation library?
[10:22:10] <djQuery> halcyon1234: the only problem I see with that is that its not scaleable. say you have 1 element that you want to associate 3 other objects
[10:23:21] <koichirose> Hello. What's the best way to show/hide a lot of elements? here's some code: http://jsfiddle.net/2ReB4/1/
[10:24:19] <GoGoGarrett> wanting to show/hide all the div's with a button? or what
[10:24:20] <Jon47> humbug halcyon1234 has a good point though I'm not sure a plugin is really warranted, if you don't want the image to flash on the screen for a second while you get the height/width, you can just move it off the visible page before you make it visible to get the dimensions - perhaps by setting its css position to absolute and then top: 100em
[10:26:29] <koichirose> GoGoGarrett: you're right, I didn't explain very well. I want only one div to be visible. If you click another span, then its next div will be visible, all the others will be hidden
[10:26:34] <koichirose> and so on
[10:26:37] <djQuery> koichirose: $("spanwrpapper").delegate('span','click',(function(e){
[10:27:12] <koichirose> djQuery: could you elaborate/edit my code?
[10:28:01] <djQuery> koichirose: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/2ReB4/4/
[10:28:13] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/2ReB4/5/
[10:28:45] <oal> Is it possible to do something like $('*[data-help="*"]').hover ... to apply hover to all tags with the attribute data-help?
[10:29:08] <djQuery> koichirose: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:29:38] <humbug> koichirose: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[10:29:47] <koichirose> djQuery: yes, that's pretty much the functionality I need.
[10:29:48] <djQuery> oal: in that case you would just do $('[data-help]')
[10:30:09] <oal> djQuery: aha. Let me try
[10:30:25] <djQuery> oal: but that selector is gonna be realy slow
[10:30:41] <oal> Hmm, how should I do it, djQuery ?
[10:30:41] <koichirose> GoGoGarrett: the toggle in your code doesn't work. Also, my question is if with a lot of elements to hide it will have performance issues
[10:31:18] <oal> add a class to all objects with that attribute, and match by .help?
[10:31:26] <koichirose> humbug: I don't see how that helps
[10:31:56] <djQuery> oal: can you give them a css class to select off of instead? are all of them inside another element so that you could limit the selector somemore? are they all the same type of element? are there a whole bunch of them? > try using delegate instead
[10:32:25] <oal> djQuery: I can give them a "help" class and use that to select them
[10:32:34] <djQuery> oal there are a ton of things to consider. its just that [attribname] is one of the slowest selectors
[10:33:00] <oal> djQuery: Class based matching is a good way?
[10:33:10] <humbug> koichirose: are you making tooltips?
[10:33:19] <djQuery> oal: certain faster than [attrib]
[10:33:26] <koichirose> humbug: kind of, yeah.
[10:33:59] <djQuery> better if you could do something like $('a.help').
[10:34:26] <humbug> is it a research or you want to use plugins?
[10:35:01] <e01> how can i perform a ajax query that can handle cookies
[10:35:34] <oal> djQuery: the thing is they are not only a-tags, so I'll have to do a $('.help') I think
[10:35:37] <djQuery> e01: they all handle cookies onless it doesnt floow the sop rules see ?sop
[10:35:38] <bot-t> e01, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[10:37:12] <koichirose> humbug: I'd like to avoid plugins
[10:37:22] <humbug> koichirose:  <a class"help">text</a>;  $("a.help").simpletip( { persistent: true });   http://craigsworks.com/projects/simpletip/
[10:37:37] <koichirose> also, it looks like something easy enough to be done in a few lines...
[10:37:42] <humbug> koichirose:  ah... your choice!
[10:38:34] <e01> djQuery: i have in the php script header that allow it header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
[10:40:02] <djQuery> oal: if you are going to be rolling your own tooltip kinda thing you might want to at least look at see ?ui.position
[10:40:03] <bot-t> oal, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[10:40:36] <djQuery> oal: its realy small and will help u in positionin your tooltip correctly
[10:41:27] <oal> djQuery: Thanks. :)
[10:43:11] <koichirose> Here's my progress...anyone willing to help? http://jsfiddle.net/2ReB4/6/
[10:43:44] <fasdfsadfasdf> anyone knows  a solution for this?  i bind a method to a click event of an  <tr> element.  when the event happens because i clicked on the row (actually on a <td> element) this happens: in my handler, the  evt.target  is NOT the <tr> element but the <tr> element
[10:44:16] <fasdfsadfasdf> sry  > >>the  evt.target  is NOT the <tr> element but the <tD> element
[10:44:33] <bittyx-laptop> is there a reverse selector to the "prev ~ siblings" one? ie. i know one sibling, and i want to get its prev.
[10:45:31] <bittyx-laptop> (that is, i know a specific set of siblings, and i want to get all of their prevs)
[10:45:44] <skamikaze> ?prev @ bittyx-laptop

[10:45:54] <skamikaze> fasdfsadfasdf: what's the problem?
[10:46:26] <koichirose> I made it, here it is for future generations :D http://jsfiddle.net/2ReB4/7/
[10:47:08] <bittyx-laptop> skamikaze: ah, i was looking at selectors, instead of traversing (but traversing does make more sense here). thanks.
[10:48:19] <playr1234>  @skamikaze:  i want to get data from the <tr> element  ..  i wrote here: http://jsfiddle.net/xdXJB/16/
[10:48:40] <playr1234> in this example i have just a div which holds data... and here it works
[10:49:44] <bittyx-laptop> koichirose: why did you complicate it so much? http://jsfiddle.net/2ReB4/8
[10:50:19] <bittyx-laptop> koichirose: no reason to select 400 hundred divs that are already hidden
[10:50:29] <skamikaze> playr1234: I still don't get the problem - sry
[10:50:52] <koichirose> bittyx-laptop: I want it to toggle, too
[10:51:00] <koichirose> if you click the same one it should hide
[10:51:34] <koichirose> I'm eager to see if there's a better solution than mine
[10:52:25] <djQuery> koichirose: sure there is see ?ui.accordion
[10:52:25] <bot-t> koichirose, http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:52:46] <koichirose> djQuery: ok, I wanted to do it myself

[10:53:45] <bittyx-laptop> koichirose: http://jsfiddle.net/2ReB4/10/ <--- the code is not as pretty, but it makes more sense to select just what you need (and with 400 divs, it might be a noticeable performance difference)
[10:53:49] <djQuery> ?p @mhazzard
[10:53:50] <koichirose> djQuery: I did it myself. It is working. bittyx-laptop told me his solution, but that doesn't work for me.
[10:53:50] <bot-t> mhazzard, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[10:54:42] <koichirose> bittyx-laptop: right. ugly code is better than performance issues
[10:54:43] <koichirose> thanks
[10:55:15] <bittyx-laptop> koichirose: it could probably be made a bit prettier if you really need it, but this would work for me, and it's the first thing that popped into mind
[10:55:57] <koichirose> bittyx-laptop: I'll look into it myself :) I like challenges
[10:55:59] <koichirose> thanks a lot
[10:56:02] <djQuery> koichirose: well it would help if they were all inside of somekind of container
[10:56:04] <bittyx-laptop> you're welcome
[10:56:13] <GoGoGarrett> Is adding a class of visible, faster performance wise compared to hide() / .show()
[10:56:27] <koichirose> GoGoGarrett: good question

[10:57:57] <Ely2> hi ... i have an ajax call on an xml document.. i would like to show the amount of items next to each category. The url per category is created with the rel attr as it's id
[10:57:58] <Ely2> http://jsfiddle.net/gPs8C/2/
[10:58:03] <bittyx-laptop> GoGoGarrett: thus the performance increase of selecting just the currently visible div and doing .removeClass vs. selecting 400 of them and doing .removeClass
[10:58:07] <Ely2> but how do i tell that count is for that item only

[10:59:57] <playr1234>  humbug: thx.. i identified the problem.. evt.target is the <td> element.. is it not possible to get the <tr> elem ?
[11:00:33] <humbug> possible. .parent()

[11:02:35] <tantalor> nope, already tried
[11:02:44] <tantalor> fails through 1.6.1
[11:03:22] <rpflo> lame, well, then, I'm pretty sure there's a bug for it, workaround is to just do [attr='']
[11:04:24] <playr1234> humbug:  oh yeah, that's an option.. thx

[11:06:26] <playr1234> djQuery: nice, finally i got my desird object :D
[11:07:28] <tantalor> very odd behavior though. it will work if there is a 2nd <select> in the document

[11:29:13] <salientKnight> I have a what I hope is a crazy simple question... how can I pass an id to the script?
[11:29:21] <GoGoGarrett> rhodee I think it's because you're not escaping your 's and "/s as well as a missing closing brace
[11:30:29] <mhazzard> anyone have experience w/ twitter jsonp feeds ?? mine is erroring out and i cant try{}catch the error :(   http://jsfiddle.net/NBCGf/23/
[11:30:43] <rhodee> GoGoGarrett: thanks for the tip, let me try it and follow up!
[11:30:54] <GoGoGarrett> Hope it helps :]
[11:30:55] <rhodee> I started about an 2hrs ago with jscript
[11:32:26] <salientKnight> to me more clear how can I specify  the id in say $("#block").dosomething()
[11:32:53] <salientKnight> I cannot use this, because the object clicked is not the object I want to toggle
[11:33:37] <mhazzard>            $.getJSON(twitterUrl,
[11:33:37] <mhazzard>         {},
[11:33:37] <mhazzard>         function(data) {
[11:33:37] <mhazzard>  is throwing "illegal character" intermittently :(
[11:33:46] <mhazzard> http://jsfiddle.net/NBCGf/24/
[11:33:57] <odyniec> rhodee: http://jsfiddle.net/swf9G/1/ - is this what you want?
[11:34:29] <Brodingo> salientKnight: to get the id use .attr('id')
[11:35:07] <rhodee> odyniec: yes this is exactly what I was looking for. GoGoGarrett caught an error, but I still don't see it. Where did I mess up?
[11:35:18] <salientKnight> Brodingo, thanks, but how will it know what the id is, if I do not pass it?
[11:35:40] <GoGoGarrett> It was just that you didn't escape, that looks good to me
[11:35:57] <salientKnight> I'm trying to do a drill down, user clicks a tag and div bellow shows up or hids
[11:36:54] <odyniec> rhodee: a couple things, actually :) .click() was not called properly (you chained .fadeOut() to it which is definitely not what you want), and the escaping part as GoGoGarrett pointed out
[11:37:21] <Engina> I'd assume it is safe to rely on the order of elements in serialize() ? i.e. I'll send a bunch of inputs whose name is Foo[] and the order of them will be as they are in the DOM
[11:37:28] <rhodee> GoGoGarrett odyniec can you send beer via irc

[11:42:20] <blueonyx> is there some selector like ~ but "upwards"?
[11:42:22] <Tallisman> :]
[11:42:22] <ryanneufeld> I like beer
[11:42:31] <Tallisman> .parent() <-- blueonyx
[11:42:58] <Ely2> humbug
[11:43:05] <Ely2> that is indeed what i could do
[11:43:09] <Ely2> but i dont need it on a click
[11:43:18] <humbug> Ely2 or you may do .each()
[11:43:32] <humbug> to process them to insert after title name
[11:43:42] <odyniec> salientKnight: you mean in the click event handler you don't know the id of the element that you want to toggle?
[11:43:50] <Ely2> thouhgt about that
[11:43:54] <Ely2> but don't now where to put it

[11:44:00] <Ely2> the result is all 7 now
[11:44:00] <blueonyx> Tallisman: err i meant upwards in the silblings, so for li 1 2 3 4, 'selector' on 3 i want to get 2 and 1
[11:44:07] <salientKnight> odyniec,  right because there are several on the page
[11:44:12] <Tallisman> oh :P
[11:44:27] <salientKnight> odyniec, that are spawned with a php loop

[11:44:42] <humbug> Ely you may learn, or you may buy
[11:44:46] <Tallisman> I don't know about such a functionality in the selector system
[11:44:54] <Ely2> x)
[11:45:09] <salientKnight> odyniec, and the id spawned based on data
[11:45:17] <blueonyx> oh lol there is .prev() and .next() xD
[11:45:21] <odyniec> salientKnight: you can use a method like .next() or .nextSibling() if the div is next to the thing that you're clicking
[11:45:24] <flowlo> hello. I have a div with height: auto; and append spans to it. Those spans do a fadeOut() and remove() themselves when the fadeout is done. The div resizes immediately, but I want it to shrink smoothly. I tried to set height as a transition protperty but with no effect. Could you give me some tips please? thank you.
[11:45:36] <salientKnight> thanks I'll try that :)
[11:45:38] <humbug> Ely2 seriously, this is usless to do stuff for you
[11:45:51] <Tallisman> .prev() only returns one element I think.
[11:45:58] <Ely2> i'll work it out :)
[11:46:52] <blueonyx> Tallisman: thats what i want :)
[11:46:59] <Tallisman> ah :)
[11:51:10] <Wilto> flowlo: You cant transition to height: auto, unfortunately. If youre able to set a static height, the transition should kick in againotherwise, you can emulate it by transitioning max-height.
[11:52:06] <flowlo> Wilto: thank you. i'll switch to a static height.
[11:52:20] <Wilto> flowlo: Its a little hackish, but if you have an element thats likely to be somewhere between 1px and 500px, you can transition from max-height: 1px; to max-height: 800px; or somesuch.
[11:52:50] <humbug> Ely2 http://jsfiddle.net/scngn/10/   xD  thx 4 interesting task, i ve learnt some things
[11:52:51] <Wilto> As long as its transitioning to a value higher than the elements could reasonably get.
[11:53:29] <Ely2> i'll study it and learn too
[11:53:30] <flowlo> Wilto: those spans are added with js. so i think i'll limit the spans to one line (or no wrapping) and save the number of spans in it. so i can set the height with js and it should do the transition

[12:49:50] <mattp_> humbug: im not sure if that is the solution. i think there is something happening with AjaxForm

[12:52:31] <mattp_> humbug: ya, http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[12:52:59] <mattp_> i just noticed it actually does the proper ajaxy submit in chrome, but not in firefox (prompts for download with application/json contenttype)
[12:53:59] <snover> mattp_: the returned content should be json wrapped in html
[12:54:03] <snover> so should be served as text/html
[12:55:21] <mattp_> snover: serverside im using Catalyst::View::JSON , i have to assume if generally JSON is transported that way, then that is happenign
[12:55:43] <snover> mattp_: I have no idea what that means
[12:56:02] <snover> all I can tell you is how the form plugin works and expects the response data
[12:56:41] <mattp_> snover: im using ajaxForm elsewhere with the same style of code server side, and it works
[12:56:50] <quiel> I'm replacing a div with a form using .load(), and after the form is shown, I want to operate on one of its fields (to markItUp) by using it #id. However the selected textfield is not affected by my script (even by something simple as hide())
[12:57:46] <snover> mattp_: then the response from the server is likely different in that other place
[12:58:03] <vacho> guys, is there any code snippet that removes duplicated from a dropdown?
[12:58:20] <quiel> is there a way to operate on new elements loaded using .load()?
[12:58:47] <xsamurai> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/5nQrL/ working on jsfiddle but the alert call shows the value undefined in my script, the html is from my script
[12:59:31] <humbug> mattp_,  https://raw.github.com/malsup/form/master/jquery.form.js
[12:59:40] <humbug> it calls $.ajax(options);
[13:00:04] <humbug> u may try extend it, or setup ajax defaults
[13:00:39] <humbug> but the plugin does not set accepts
[13:00:59] <mattp_> humbug: ah i think i know whats happening. ive got a file input on this form, so its forcing iframe mode
[13:01:17] <mattp_> which may explain the difference between that and my other usages of jquery.ajaxform

[13:09:32] <sahilsk> hi
[13:10:23] <rpflo> Is there a way with jQuery.widget to call the super method in a sub-widget?
[13:10:36] <sahilsk> i'm having a little problem with this code. Problem is i can't see the background of my slides, but can see the text written inside my slide as the slide changes.  http://jsfiddle.net/sahilsk/nYaYz/1/
[13:10:49] <sahilsk> any help would be great. :(
[13:10:57] <z1000> if you hit learn more under #1 the slide is jerky... any ideas / suggestions? http://ogkdev.com/core/are-we-right-for-you
[13:11:11] <Ely2> s there a way to limit the amout of items processed by an xml request?
[13:11:59] <Diverdude> How can i do remove html tags from a string in jquery?
[13:12:08] <humbug> Ely2 =) define your own function for processing
[13:12:36] <Ely2> mmz ok :p
[13:13:03] <Diverdude> ?
[13:13:34] <xsamurai> how come using $("#"+var).val() works fine in jsfiddle yet in my script it shows up as undefined, if i use the value of var as in 3 or whatever it works fine
[13:13:38] <z1000> anyone?
[13:13:57] <humbug> Diverdude what do you mean by html tags?
[13:14:23] <skamikaze> Diverdude: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[13:14:43] <xsamurai> regex or string replacement
[13:15:15] <Diverdude> i want to makesure nohtml code and javascript code from an input field which i submit to the server via ajax, ever enters the database
[13:15:57] <Tallisman> Diverdude, thehandler is php?
[13:16:04] <humbug> Diverdude its a serverside job
[13:16:36] <Tallisman> mysql_real_escape_string();
[13:16:46] <humbug> Diverdude because one may use debugger to turn off your function, and you will fail...
[13:16:48] <arpegius> how can i return the 4th item in a jquery object set?
[13:16:59] <blindMoe> Diverdude: http://www.denhamcoote.com/php-howto-sanitize-database-inputs
[13:17:00] <humbug> [3]
[13:17:46] <Diverdude> ok
[13:17:58] <humbug> i mean arpegius, obj[3]
[13:18:16] <arpegius> humbug: i've got to wrap that in $() right?
[13:18:21] <z1000> figured it out
[13:18:30] <arpegius> if i want to use query on it that is
[13:18:34] <z1000> for the record when slideUp or down is jerky... just throw a width on the element
[13:18:36] <arpegius> $(obj[3]);
[13:20:10] <Woet> arpegius: no, probably not
[13:20:15] <Woet> i'm not sure in which context you are
[13:20:22] <xsamurai> http://jsfiddle.net/5nQrL/2/
[13:20:49] <arpegius> so its $obj (bunch of <li>). i can only act on the 4th li if i do $(obj[3]) Woet
[13:20:58] <Woet> xsamurai: because you didn't put all relevant javascript there
[13:21:03] <arpegius> $obj[3] just returns dom
[13:21:09] <Woet> arpegius: $("li").eq(3)
[13:21:29] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[13:21:31] <arpegius> i already have my $obj its faster to work within its context i think.
[13:21:44] <arpegius> as opposed to traversing the dom again
[13:21:50] <Woet> okay, show your relevant code
[13:21:56] <Woet> obj = $("li")
[13:21:58] <Woet> something like that?
[13:22:07] <humbug> =)
[13:22:10] <arpegius> obj = $('ul')
[13:22:11] <xsamurai> Woet: I would think jquery would be sufficient , i dont see jsfiddle loading something extra that my script isnt
[13:22:23] <arpegius> i need to act on the ul first too
[13:22:31] <Woet> arpegius: obj[3].fadeIn();
[13:22:34] <Woet> should work fine for example
[13:22:43] <Woet> xsamurai: any errors in your console?
[13:22:49] <Woet> got a link by any chance?
[13:22:56] <xsamurai> nope
[13:22:57] <Brodingo> ?eq
[13:22:58] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[13:23:14] <Brodingo> square brackets get the html element
[13:23:17] <xsamurai> Woet: unfortunately no its internal
[13:23:23] <Brodingo> use eq() to get the jquery object
[13:23:46] <xsamurai> if i put the value of the id as "#3" it works fine but "#"+num will not
[13:23:50] <humbug> i luv this channel, i am staying here
[13:23:54] <xsamurai> which is odd
[13:23:56] <Woet> xsamurai: your code looks fine
[13:24:03] <Woet> xsamurai: i can only imagine something overriding the num variable
[13:24:06] <arpegius> Woet: Brodingo eq worked. thanks.
[13:24:11] <arpegius> $lis.eq(4)
[13:24:16] <Woet> :)
[13:24:25] <xsamurai> Woet: k i'll dig around, thanks
[13:24:30] <arpegius> i rarely have to use it, so i forget about it
[13:24:48] <xsamurai> actually its the num variable getting overwritten
[13:24:50] <xsamurai> its not
[13:24:51] <Brodingo> ?g html valid id
[13:24:53] <bot-t> Brodingo, What are valid values for the id attribute in HTML? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/70579/what-are-valid-values-for-the-id-attribute-in-html
[13:25:00] <Brodingo> dont start ids with numbers

[13:26:18] <xsamurai> Brodingo: maybe let me change it

[13:27:32] <Layke> Anyone use Nivo Slider? Is it a common bug that the pictures some times leave the actual slider viewport.

[13:30:59] <xsamurai> that was weird, for example using number only didnt work, using id# didnt work , id_# finally worked
[13:31:02] <humbug> awsome!

[13:34:03] <humbug> sry 4 spamming, bye
[13:37:48] <coleGillespie> anyone know any good "object systems" for javascript?
[13:37:54] <coleGillespie> by that I mean... 3rd party libs that help you define classes/objects... and that help with serializing to/from json and sending to/from server... ideally with object code re-usable in nodejs on the server-side?
[13:40:17] <geekbuntu_> coleGillespie, are you looking for a controlling framework?
[13:40:19] <geekbuntu_> like this? http://qooxdoo.org/
[13:41:42] <geekbuntu_> coleGillespie, i am away a lot so i'll leave these links for you (in case it is what you're looking for) http://dive.dhiti.com/redir/?u=http%3A//blog.dreamcss.com/frameworks/plainajax-lightweight-javascript-framework/%3Fdhiti%3D1&session=dreamcss&widget=3&p=                http://dive.dhiti.com/redir/?u=http%3A//blog.dreamcss.com/frameworks/wink-toolkit-mobile-javascript-framework/%3Fdhiti%3D1&session=dreamcss&widget=3&p=                http://dive.dhit

[13:43:13] <gopus> When you use JQUERY UI's DATEPICKER on an input field, does it nullify whatever value might already be in the field?
[13:43:25] <coleGillespie> geekbuntu_: no more like https://github.com/substack/dnode
[13:43:57] <gopus> I would like for JQUERY UI's datepicker to acknowledge the value I already set, but there doesn't seem to be an option for it.
[13:44:03] <janthony> I noticed that some pages that use ajax to load in content use /#!/ in their url. Any ideas why?
[13:44:43] <mxbtty> janthony: google 'hash bang url' to learn all about it
[13:44:57] <mxbtty> somewhat of a controversial topic
[13:47:24] <gopus> it would appear that datepicker does in fact do that...
[13:47:43] <gopus> is there anyway to have datepicker ACKNOWLEDGE and USE the predetermined date that might be in VALUE?
[13:49:10] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: Is there a way to callSuper in a jQuery.widget method?  When you've set a base arg ofc.
[13:49:59] <janthony> mxbtty: thanks!
[13:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: in 1.9 there is :-)
[13:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> in 1.8, you've just got to know the parent widget
[13:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> you'll see lots of $.Widget.prototype.something.call( this, ... ) in our widgets
[13:51:16] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: cool
[13:51:26] <rpflo> that's what I've been doing didn't know if there was a shortcut
[13:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/962848
[13:51:46] <n2liquid> I want to select free text inside a DOM element using jQuery (i.e.: <a>free text!</a>); is there a way to do that?
[13:54:02] <gopus> n2liquid: wouldn't it just be var poop = $(a).text?
[13:54:47] <Brodingo> $('a').text()
[13:54:50] <n2liquid> gopus, yeah, probably
[13:55:15] <n2liquid> hm.. actually I want to wrap each letter in a span so I can animate the text
[13:55:32] <n2liquid> do you think I should just pick the text, split it, create the elements and remove the original text?
[13:55:43] <n2liquid> or maybe there's a better way to it?
[13:56:03] <jovrtn> animate the text eh
[13:56:15] <n2liquid> jovrtn, it's a smal text, don't worry ;)
[13:56:19] <n2liquid> not a full page, heh
[13:56:29] <n2liquid> small*
[13:56:38] <Brodingo> theres some jquery ui text effects
[13:56:50] <n2liquid> I've only seen plugins
[13:56:54] <n2liquid> are there native ones?
[13:57:49] <Brodingo> http://dev.seankoole.com/jquery/ui-effect/text.html
[13:58:04] <nguyendh> i have <div class="a" style="display: block"></div><div class="a" style="display: none"></div>... and many more. how do I 'show' the hidden div just after the latest 'showed' div ?
[13:58:08] <jovrtn> n2liquid: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2977473/using-jquery-how-do-you-wrap-each-letter-in-a-tag
[13:58:12] <jovrtn> just some quick googlies
[13:58:27] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: cool, I'll check out the 1.9 code, is that on master?
[13:58:58] <n2liquid> jovrtn, thx
[13:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: yeah, and pretty much all of the new features were in before 1.9m5
[13:59:18] <byteme_> currently this newsletter signup on my http://216.119.82.19/  submits fine to the email service but where is the best place to reset it to null after I return back to my site?
[13:59:49] <byteme_> http://jsfiddle.net/arzua/3/
[14:00:23] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: excellent, I'll check it out.  I was about to come up with some suggestions, see if there was any interest.
[14:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?component=ui.widget&resolution=fixed&milestone=1.9
[14:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> that should list out all the new stuff
[14:00:52] <xsamurai> ok this is beyond annoying, i still can figure out why $("#id_"+num) doesnt work in my script when $("#id_3") works fine
[14:01:04] <xsamurai> i hope its not due to the script being in iframe
[14:01:48] <Brodingo> are you sure num is what its supposed to be?
[14:01:51] <erichynds> what does $('#id_'+num).selector return?
[14:01:52] <nguyendh> make sure your 'num' is what you expected
[14:01:58] <xsamurai> Brodingo: yes
[14:03:27] <xsamurai> erichynds: #id_2 or #id_3 depending on which dropdown i select
[14:03:35] <erichynds> o rly
[14:03:51] <xsamurai> is that the expected response ?
[14:03:55] <erichynds> yeah
[14:04:13] <Acorn> Ajax - How do I add a processing step to the data before it gets passed to the success callback?
[14:04:22] <erichynds> can you put a demo up on jsfiddle xsamurai?
[14:05:25] <nguyendh> acom, do it on the server side ?
[14:05:30] <xsamurai> erichynds: already have one up http://jsfiddle.net/5nQrL/2/ , this works fine in jsfiddle but in my script this is inside colorbox
[14:06:21] <byteme_> given my jquery here http://jsfiddle.net/arzua/3/   How could I set my textbox back to empty with the watermark text showing?
[14:06:24] <xsamurai> which apparently doesnt work and shows up undefined
[14:06:35] <byteme_> http://216.119.82.19/  you can see the behavior now on this site
[14:06:53] <byteme_> dont worry the service is in test mode...you wont get subscribed
[14:08:19] <jovrtn> xsamurai: log your var to the console and see if it's within the correct scope
[14:11:25] <janthony> can jquery do anything with urls? i.e. when you have return false on a link, is there a way to still have it append something to the address bar? (w/o using the #)
[14:11:50] <blindMoe> jwuery BBQ may be able to do that
[14:11:55] <blindMoe> err jquery BBQ
[14:12:53] <tbranyen> janthony: without #?
[14:12:58] <tbranyen> you can use the html5 history api
[14:13:05] <tbranyen> but thats not widely supported
[14:14:09] <ioannis> Hi, how can I not display the little x button on the title bar of jquery ui dialog?
[14:14:36] <xsamurai> jovrtn: i've pasted the results in the css box http://jsfiddle.net/5nQrL/3/ , thanks
[14:15:33] <diamonds> how do I get the index of an element relative to it's siblings?
[14:15:38] <janthony> Ok, thanks
[14:15:46] <diamonds> like "1" (second li) etc.
[14:15:48] <erichynds> diamonds: $(elem).index()
[14:15:57] <diamonds> it returned -1 :(
[14:16:34] <diamonds> am I using closure properly in this setTimeout? http://pastie.org/2063096
[14:16:57] <erichynds> diamonds: try $(container).index('selector')
[14:17:59] <diamonds> $that.parent().index($that); still returns -1
[14:18:11] <xsamurai> my guess my issues is due to some strange voodoo having the code in a colorbox popup
[14:18:51] <ryanneufeld> how does one compare objects for equality in JS?
[14:18:54] <diamonds> I don't really need the index, I'm just trying to see what $that is, make sure I'm not closuring the gate after the horse is gone
[14:19:05] <ryanneufeld> in java it's varOne.equals(varTwo)
[14:19:15] <diamonds> ryanneufeld: ==
[14:19:25] <ryanneufeld> I'm passing two elements into a function and I need to see if they are the same element
[14:19:42] <diamonds> if( elem1 == elem2 )
[14:19:48] <ryanneufeld> hrm
[14:19:53] <diamonds> or if you want to see if they are the EXACT same ===
[14:19:57] <ryanneufeld> that's giving me false
[14:20:02] <ryanneufeld> even when it should be true
[14:20:06] <diamonds> perhaps they are not the same element?
[14:20:11] <diamonds> ryanneufeld: bin some code
[14:20:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:20:20] <diamonds> better yet jsfiddle it :)
[14:20:46] <rworth> are they jQuery objects? If so, they might be sep. objects that wrap the same dom element, in which case you need to compare objA[0] === objB[0]
[14:21:10] <ryanneufeld> console.log
[14:21:14] <ryanneufeld> one is undefined
[14:21:15] <ryanneufeld> erff
[14:21:40] <drewby> Events don't work across windows. =/
[14:24:31] <ryanneufeld> wouldn't that be nice
[14:24:40] <ryanneufeld> for spammers and popup writers
[14:24:54] <cpgo> How can I catch a onsubmit event for a form and stop the form from being submitted. I have this now: http://pastebin.com/CsVYHrAi but does not work.
[14:26:24] <ryanneufeld> $(form_selector_goes_here).submit(function(){  return false;});
[14:26:26] <Woet> cpgo: use .submit
[14:26:28] <Woet> damnit
[14:26:40] <Woet> cpgo: you have .onSubmit, it's .submit
[14:26:47] <cpgo> I tried that as well
[14:26:52] <systemfault> Documentation.. it exists.
[14:26:53] <ryanneufeld> ?submit @ cpgo
[14:26:53] <bot-t> cpgo, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[14:27:10] <Woet> cpgo: and that's not how you assign a function to it
[14:27:17] <Woet> please read what systemfault said :)
[14:27:20] <ryanneufeld> bot-t.. the polite way to tell someone to RTFM
[14:27:27] <cpgo> Once again, tried that as well.
[14:27:32] <cpgo> will retry
[14:27:45] <Woet> cpgo: then give us the pastebin without 2 errors
[14:27:48] <Woet> :)
[14:29:05] <ryanneufeld> diamonds: == and === both worked, thx, I had other problems. (scope related)
[14:31:40] <jedimind> is there something that firefox4 does in back/forward behaviour that would prevent document.ready from triggering properly?
[14:32:09] <Woet> ryanneufeld:
[14:32:12] <Woet> ?eval print(String.fromCharCode(82) + String.fromCharCode(84) + String.fromCharCode(70) + String.fromCharCode(77));
[14:32:16] <bot-t> Woet: "RTFM"
[14:32:22] <Woet> yay!
[14:32:42] <cpgo> Woet: http://pastebin.com/8EmN8B4N - I get the alert, once I press ok it gets submitted still.
[14:32:49] <ryanneufeld> RTFM is eval print(String.fromCharCode(82) + String.fromCharCode(84) + String.fromCharCode(70) + String.fromCharCode(77));
[14:32:53] <ryanneufeld> ?RTFM
[14:32:53] <bot-t> http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[14:33:05] <ryanneufeld> lulz
[14:33:07] <jedimind> ha
[14:33:22] <Woet> :P
[14:35:38] <jedimind> so can someone indulge me for a moment... http://42ink.pud.ca/all-about-us/ ; click around on the primary nav items (couple of pages should do it), then use back/forward in firefox
[14:35:46] <jedimind> it doesnt execute my .animate on document.ready
[14:35:55] <jedimind> every other browser (including IE7) does it fine
[14:37:36] <Woet> jedimind: why is there an ugly refresh?
[14:37:53] <jedimind> because the page itself gets refreshed?
[14:37:56] <Woet> well
[14:38:01] <jedimind> im not grabbing the content via an xhr
[14:38:02] <Woet> why don't you make it sexy and don't refresh the page? :)
[14:38:16] <jedimind> that's an eventual possibility, when i have more time :)
[14:39:12] <jedimind> also, once i put this into production mode with the right caching settings for both apache + wordpress, the refresh wont be noticeable at all
[14:39:20] <diamonds> hep me http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/2/
[14:39:23] <Woet> if you say so!
[14:39:29] <Woet> im not sure why firefox is being silly though
[14:39:41] <Woet> diamonds: what?!
[14:39:49] <jedimind> he needs some heps!
[14:39:51] <Woet> <li>zork<a> <li>ah ah</a>
[14:39:53] <Woet> is this a joke?
[14:39:58] * diamonds shrugs
[14:39:59] <jedimind> lol
[14:40:04] <diamonds> I got past foo bar baz
[14:40:20] <diamonds> anyway do you know how to make the persist-hover class be removed reliably?
[14:40:26] <diamonds> check the console, it's doing strange things....
[14:40:36] <xsamurai> how would one take submitted data from a  form inside pop iframe and on submit update the parent page ?
[14:40:52] <bittyx-laptop> if i do element.after(newElement), what does .after() return, element or newElement?
[14:41:02] <Woet> diamonds: strange, invalid, messed up HTML is causing strange, invalid, messed up things
[14:41:04] <Woet> sounds unexpected
[14:41:09] <erichynds> bittyx-laptop: element
[14:41:13] <diamonds> Woet: what is invalid?
[14:41:22] <Woet> [23:39:51] <Woet> <li>zork<a> <li>ah ah</a>
[14:41:23] <Woet> [23:39:53] <Woet> is this a joke?
[14:41:30] <diamonds> ohhhh!!
[14:41:35] <diamonds> sorry I missed that :)
[14:41:37] <bittyx-laptop> erichynds: hmm, how would i go about getting the newElement? have to make a new selector? (the newElement is actually data from a post request)
[14:41:44] <diamonds> I thought you were referring to the names
[14:41:47] <Woet> no
[14:41:47] <bittyx-laptop> erichynds: or is there an easier way?
[14:41:53] <Woet> i'm referring to the <li> and <a> and </a>
[14:41:57] <erichynds> bittyx-laptop: correct. $(newelement).insertAfter(element)
[14:42:21] <diamonds> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/3/
[14:42:24] <Woet> diamonds: there is a reason jsfiddle turns them red
[14:42:27] <bittyx-laptop> erichynds: thanks.
[14:42:33] <Woet> and it's still red
[14:42:41] <diamonds> you are right!
[14:43:00] <csmrfx> Given n input textboxes and an array of n items, how would you set those array items into the textboxes as values
[14:43:22] <csmrfx> $("input")[i].val(arr[i]) does not work
[14:43:40] <Woet> diamonds: and now we can get started: what are you trying to do?
[14:43:44] <diamonds> OK http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/5/
[14:43:49] <diamonds> sorry for the confusion
[14:44:15] <diamonds> hover in, turn red, hover out, wait a second then turn back
[14:44:35] <diamonds> (unless you mouse over another item in which case immediately turn the others off)
[14:44:43] <Woet> okay, 1 min
[14:44:47] <diamonds> it's for a dropdown menu but I didn't want to recreate the whole thing
[14:45:00] <ngharo> diamonds: siblings('persist-hover') should be siblings('.persist-hover')
[14:45:16] <diamonds> ngharo: good call, thank you
[14:45:25] <csmrfx> It seems there is weird behaviouir in jQuery 1.6 http://pastie.org/2063253
[14:45:30] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/6/
[14:46:05] <ngharo> csmrfx: $(foo)[0] returns the first DOM node of the jquery selector
[14:46:09] <diamonds> damnation jsfiddle is not my friend this evening... http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/7/
[14:46:36] <ngharo> csmrfx: you must call .val() on a jquery object, not a dom node
[14:46:46] <csmrfx> hmm....
[14:47:20] <byteme_> given my jquery here http://jsfiddle.net/arzua/4/   How could I set my textbox back to empty with the watermark text showing after clicking "Sign Up"?
[14:47:22] <ngharo> csmrfx: you can loop over jquery objects, see ?each
[14:47:22] <bot-t> csmrfx, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:47:23] <diamonds> anyway if you mouse over the whole thing (top to bottom), it checks in properly (it seems) from hoverIN and hoverOUT but turnLiOff is only from the *last* one you hovered
[14:47:25] <csmrfx> Does that mean one must iterate through all the values returned by the selector?
[14:47:34] <ngharo> ?eq @ csmrfx
[14:47:35] <bot-t> csmrfx, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/

[14:48:06] <merrick> I want to animate a box with rounded corners (div  { width:50px; background:#000000; height:50px; border-radius:25px;   }) so that when its clicked it doubles in size.  The thing is when I click on it.  It flashes the div without rounded corners and then performs the animation correcttly.  Why is it flashing the div first and then doing the animation?
[14:48:33] <ngharo> ?p @ merrick
[14:48:34] <bot-t> merrick, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:49:01] <merrick> http://jsfiddle.net/codingfreak/9LnTE/
[14:49:24] <merrick> oops, ignore that link
[14:49:57] <merrick> http://jsfiddle.net/6YBJX/
[14:49:59] <merrick> that's it
[14:50:46] <diamonds> hot potatoes I may have found it
[14:50:52] <erichynds> merrick: pretty sure you have to specify each corner individually in animate()
[14:51:09] <diamonds> lol I was referring to the same, global "that"
[14:51:19] <jedimind> if i have say 10 LI items, and want to animate all of them to drop down, but in succession not at once; anyone think of a simple way to do this?
[14:51:52] <Tallisman> Euhm, I don't know what I am doing wrong on the following line 'index.php?pid=0&mode=open', I use it in an <a href=""
[14:51:56] * diamonds goes to write "use the keyword var to instantiate variables with local scope" 100 times on the chalk board
[14:52:23] <Tallisman> the validator says general entity 'mode' not defined and no default entity
[14:53:01] <diamonds> Woet: ty
[14:53:19] <Woet> diamonds: one min
[14:53:33] <diamonds> Woet: it's done, thank you
[14:53:40] <Woet> diamonds: i'm improving you code!
[14:53:46] <diamonds> lol oh ok :)
[14:53:57] <Acorn> how do you enable cross domain requests in firefox for local files while developing?
[14:54:19] <diamonds> but at this point it ain't broke... so whether it's advisable to fix it is an unsettled question.
[14:54:30] <ngharo> merrick: erichynds is right -- http://jsfiddle.net/6YBJX/1/
[14:55:07] <odyniec> jedimind: how about something along the lines of: function dropdown($li) { $li.slideDown(500, function () { if ($(this)).nextSibling()) dropdown($(this).nextSibling()); }); }
[14:55:21] <sokie_de> you could just get the content of the remote file by a simple php script to tst locally
[14:55:48] <sokie_de> *test
[14:55:52] <Tallisman> macheleon, do you know what is wrong with '<a href="index.php?pid=0&mode=open">Open..</a>'?
[14:56:20] <diamonds> Woet: tick tock tick tock... :p
[14:56:24] <Woet> diamonds: grr
[14:56:29] <Woet> there must be a better way to do this
[14:56:53] <diamonds> I mean, I'm sure you could tighten it up a bit... http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/8/
[14:57:14] <diamonds> but it's not TOO bad at this point. Gets the job done
[14:57:16] <macheleon> Tallisman: there's no title attribute
[14:57:28] <diamonds> Woet: what have you got so far (may I see?)?
[14:57:29] <Tallisman> except that :P
[14:57:54] <macheleon> :) was joking, um I don't see a problem ... but my disclaimer is that it's early
[14:58:25] <docyes> jquery 1.4.2 quick question with appending a time stamp to all url's, anyone do this before. ajaxSend and updating the options is not working as expected.
[14:59:12] <Tallisman> cannot generate system identifier for general entity "mode" <-- the validator :P
[14:59:43] <byteme_> anyone know how I can reset form values after a click takes users to a different page with a link back to the site?
[15:00:32] <diamonds> byteme_: you mean like, if the "backup" into the form
[15:00:33] <diamonds> ?
[15:00:38] <diamonds> *they
[15:01:02] <Tallisman> ?val byteme
[15:01:04] <harpoon1> Question - I have a select box for employees with about 800 items.  What is the best jquery way of converting my select box into something more user friendly?
[15:01:04] <bot-t> Tallisman, Couldn't find "val byteme" in jQuery Docs.
[15:01:05] <macheleon> Tallisman: google is talking to me about unencoded ampersands in url
[15:01:08] <byteme_> diamonds http://216.119.82.19/  its the newsletter signup
[15:01:17] <Woet> diamonds: http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/9/
[15:01:19] <Woet> but it's not much better
[15:01:23] <byteme_> you can put in a bogus email and see what I mean
[15:01:31] <Woet> i know there is a better way to handle the timeout
[15:01:37] <Woet> its too late to think of it
[15:01:41] <byteme_> submit takes user to the thankyou page of the service with a link back to the site
[15:01:48] <Tallisman> ?val
[15:01:49] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[15:01:53] <Tallisman> that's better.
[15:01:54] <byteme_> need to reset them when they return
[15:01:57] <diamonds> Woet: ahhh use one set timeout
[15:02:01] <diamonds> that is better :)
[15:02:10] <Woet> yes, but it can be better!
[15:02:13] <Woet> grr
[15:02:36] * diamonds waits to see it
[15:02:37] <Tallisman> unencoded ampersants.. hmmpf
[15:02:49] <diamonds> Woet: one more iteration and you've got yourself a blog post! :p
[15:03:39] <diamonds> "First I was like 'addClass('persist-hover')', then I was like 'blur = setTimeout(function()...'
[15:03:45] <diamonds> then I lol'd :D"
[15:03:58] <merrick> erichynds, tried it but still the same issue.  were u able to get it to work without the flash?
[15:04:30] <ShawnRisk> how do I change an unorder list into a select box form?
[15:04:45] <byteme_> well someone tested it... did you submit  diamonds?
[15:05:03] <diamonds> byteme_: can you check the referer and see if they came from http://workstate.createsend.com/ ?
[15:05:24] <byteme_> yes diamonds
[15:05:37] <byteme_> Im logged in to the service now so I can see the emails
[15:05:42] <csmrfx> ngharo: thank you sir
[15:05:57] <merrick> can someone get this animation to work without the box flashing?  http://jsfiddle.net/SWbrC/
[15:07:07] <webPragmatist> i'm wondering if jquery can help me do this basically i have a <ul> with a bunch of horizontal <li> tags that I need to have resized to fit inside of the <li>.  i was thinking .eq() could do this...
[15:07:24] <jedimind> when using .each there's some sort of index there as it's iterating right?
[15:07:24] <webPragmatist> it's basically mimicking display: table-cell;
[15:07:56] <ngharo> ?each
[15:07:57] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:08:03] <ngharo> index is passed to callback
[15:08:29] <jedimind> yeah, i wonder why it just keeps giving me 0
[15:08:51] <jedimind> .each(function(i) {  console.log(i) })
[15:09:24] <[Joose]> Hello, meat_popsicle
[15:09:40] <meat_popsicle> Hola sier
[15:09:42] <meat_popsicle> sir*
[15:09:47] <jedimind> or i guess what im really looking for is a way to let me know when the series of items is completed
[15:09:54] <byteme_> diamonds if you looked at the service page its just doing javascript:history.go(-1)
[15:09:58] <[Joose]> In other languages you can import library (i.e. import * in Java), can you do that with JS?
[15:10:16] <[Joose]> More specifically, can I import the jQuery file into a JS script?
[15:10:17] <byteme_> so I was wrong to say the service linked back to the site
[15:10:26] <ngharo> jedimind: each(function(i, element) { ... })
[15:11:14] <ngharo> ?getscript @ [Joose]
[15:11:15] <bot-t> [Joose], jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[15:11:36] <Woet> diamonds: it seems like it SHOULD be easier, but it cannot
[15:11:49] <Woet> i was thinking something like $(".hover").clearTimeout().removeClass("hover");
[15:11:51] <meat_popsicle> [Joose]: you have to include the <script> tag in your html first
[15:11:58] <merrick> individual corners was the way: http://jsfiddle.net/F2ndh/
[15:12:02] <Woet> and $(this).setTimeout(function(){ ... }, 1000);
[15:12:09] <Woet> but jQuery doesn't have such cool features :(
[15:12:15] <ngharo> >_>
[15:12:21] <byteme_> meat_popsicle 5th element reference?
[15:12:25] <[Joose]> So can I use .hide() in my own JS file?
[15:12:27] <ngharo> Woet: what are you trying to accomplish?
[15:12:46] <Woet> ngharo: trying to make this nicer: http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/9/
[15:12:51] <meat_popsicle> [Joose]: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html
[15:13:02] <meat_popsicle> byteme_: mayhaps, sir
[15:13:12] <ngharo> Woet: define "nicer"
[15:13:16] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can tell me how to do my problem
[15:13:23] <Woet> ngharo: not needing 2 variables, but linking the timer to the element
[15:13:29] <byteme_> Im good at creating problems
[15:13:36] <byteme_> solving them ...meh
[15:14:44] <keyo> Any reason why this would not work: setTimeout(function() {
[15:14:45] <keyo>                 $('input[name=refresh_diagnostic_analysis]').attr('checked','false');
[15:14:45] <keyo>                 }, 10 * 1 * 1000);
[15:16:00] <Brodingo> ?dotimeout
[15:16:00] <bot-t> doTimeout, a jQuery plugin that takes the work out of delayed code execution, including interval and timeout management, polling loops and debouncing. In addition, its fully jQuery chainable - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[15:16:19] <ngharo> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/10/
[15:16:29] <Woet> i knew it!
[15:16:34] <odyniec> keyo: you might be missing quotes around the value in the selector
[15:16:43] <Woet> i knew there was a .timer kind of thing for jquery
[15:16:44] <ngharo> Woet: that depends on jquery ui tho
[15:16:51] <ngharo> delay only works on animations
[15:16:57] <Woet> yea
[15:16:58] <Woet> i thought so
[15:17:15] <ngharo> keyo: try .prop('checked', false)
[15:17:16] <keyo> odyniec: Found it. Apparently it works with .attr('checked', false); Boolean instead of string val
[15:17:19] <Woet> but you could set a 1ms time for the animation
[15:17:33] <Woet> ngharo: it isnt perfect though, if you quickly move over them
[15:17:37] <keyo> ngharo: thanks mate, I'll look that one up
[15:17:48] <ngharo> np
[15:17:52] <Woet> ngharo: does it need .stop().removeClass in the .hover to kill the delay?
[15:19:16] <ngharo> stop will kill any current animations
[15:19:20] <juha____> holy craplamoly
[15:19:31] <jedimind> is there a persistent .hover that doesnt rely on mousein/out?
[15:19:35] <Woet> ngharo: and how would you kill the delay?
[15:19:37] <juha____> i just solved one of the "hardest" puzzle in facebook careers page :D
[15:21:24] <ngharo> Woet: i thought you wanted the delay!?
[15:21:35] <Woet> ngharo: but it should kill the delay when it adds the class
[15:21:38] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/5HbfL/11/
[15:21:41] <Woet> e.g. blur -> hover
[15:21:49] <Woet> no, ngharo :P
[15:21:53] <ngharo> lol
[15:21:55] <Woet> it should remove the class after 1 second
[15:22:02] <Woet> but if you hover over it again within that 1 second
[15:22:05] <Woet> it should kill that delay
[15:22:12] <Woet> so hover -> blur -> hover stays red
[15:22:57] <byteme_> funny the desired functionality only works in IE
[15:24:39] <draginx> Whats the best way to take an HTML object out from another HTML obj? So turning <a><img></a> into just <img> ?
[15:24:55] <muay-guy> hello, I've been asked by a client to create an 'intro' to his website. He wants a flash-like intro, where you get a blank page with the logo for a few seconds before the website loads,... is something like that doable with jQuery?
[15:24:57] <draginx> unwrap nvm :D
[15:25:18] <simenbrekken> draginx: $('a img').unwrap()
[15:25:24] <draginx> yup thanks :)
[15:26:04] <simenbrekken> muay-guy: it's possible (and annoying), you could hide everything else via css classes for a few seconds and then remove that class
[15:26:13] <Pyrodogg> is .slideUp() broken? Not even working for me here http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[15:26:34] <simenbrekken> Pyrodogg: working here chrome
[15:26:40] <draginx> Pyrodogg: works fine for me in mac osx chrome
[15:27:01] <muay-guy> simenbrekken: yeah, it's definitely annoying but I didn't want to hear any crap about not being able to use flash
[15:27:21] <Pyrodogg> weird, I tried Chrome nd ff.  I'll go back to figuring it out later. thnx
[15:28:43] <LakWork> I'm using jQuery.map() to return a modified array of values, but i need to skip certain elements if they meet a given condition. I tried using a continue in the map function, but that was no go. Is there a way to do this?
[15:28:54] <simenbrekken> muay-guy: you could ask him if its a good idea to waste his customers time. And if it was a good idea, why isn't Google/Microsoft/Apple doing it? :)
[15:28:58] <[Joose]> If I import jquery.js and show-pofiles.js into the same HTML file, can I use functions from jquery.js in show-profiles.js?
[15:29:28] <simenbrekken> LakWork: what sort of condition? you could wrap the body of the map function in a simple if?
[15:29:40] <LakWork> it's an if per element
[15:29:43] <Tallisman> hmm, what is supposed to be around a textarea? :P
[15:29:52] <LakWork> so i have 6 elements and 1 doesn't match, i'd return just 5
[15:30:04] <simenbrekken> Tallisman: form?
[15:30:15] <Tallisman> there is a form around it :P
[15:30:18] <djQuery> Tallisman: all that is required to be around it is html
[15:30:22] <muay-guy> simenbrekken: well, I'm hired by someone who's hired by the guy who actually wants this crap... so I guess I better just find a way of doing it, figure out where the guy who's two steps above me lives and kick him in the nuts
[15:30:39] <Tallisman>  Line 99, Column 49: document type does not allow element "textarea" here; missing one of "p", "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "div", "pre", "address", "fieldset", "ins", "del" start-tag
[15:30:52] <LakWork> maybbe i should use a standard loop instead
[15:31:02] <simenbrekken> LakWork: yeah, maybe :) it's not that much slower
[15:31:47] <simenbrekken> muay-guy: you could do something like body.intro not(#intro) { display: none}
[15:32:02] <simenbrekken> muay-guy: and then just remove that intro class from the body when you're done
[15:32:41] <simenbrekken> muay-guy: or just add the crap on top of the pager :P
[15:33:25] <muay-guy> simenbrekken: cool. Where do I set the time though?
[15:34:01] <simenbrekken> muay-guy: $('#intro-covering-page').delay(2000).fadeOut();
[15:34:23] <muay-guy> simenbrekken: thanks, I'm trying it right now
[15:35:45] <simenbrekken> I remember when I was young and we read docs!
[15:37:26] <djQuery> simenbrekken: damn u must be old

[15:40:11] <webPragmatist> thanks
[15:40:20] <webPragmatist> wasn't sure if there was a more magical way of doing it
[15:42:36] <jjb123> Hey everyone! I have a quick question. I'm trying to get jquery-validate to work on my forms and it is working, for the most part. The problem is that when I submit a blank form and jquery-validate catches it and displays the "Please fill this out" message next to the fields, only one of them responds to new input. In this case, I have two fields, a password and email field. When I type a password into the password field the error goes aw
[15:43:03] <webPragmatist> djQuery: if an element has padding: 5px and you call css('padding-right') would it return 5?
[15:43:06] <devth> i assumed it would work to attach multiple $(window).resize listeners, but it appears they are being overridden. am i mistaken?
[15:45:11] <keyo> what is the best practice for ending a click event. I read return false is bad.
[15:45:20] <byteme_> http://jsfiddle.net/arzua/5/
[15:45:29] <byteme_> this doesnt seem to work in firefox
[15:47:13] <byteme_> normal behavior is for button click to go to thankyou page
[15:47:20] <byteme_> does firefox not like prevent default?
[15:47:22] <xsamurai> http://jsfiddle.net/QrtZA/ another weird problem, on submit this loops depending on how many dynamic selects i have on the screen
[15:51:15] <Tallisman> Big note to self.. IF you try to submit something, use type="submit"
[15:51:26] <Tallisman> do not confuse submit with button =_=
[15:51:38] <devinrolsen_> ^^
[15:51:54] <Tallisman> seriously, i have spend hours to find that problem XD
[15:51:56] <imsky> maybe read an html book next time, too
[15:52:01] <Eliasen> Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone could help me, I have a quick question :).
[15:52:03] <devinrolsen_> burn!
[15:52:03] <devth> how do u find where an event listener is getting pwned?
[15:52:13] <Tallisman> agree, Burn! xD
[15:52:29] <Tallisman> Eliasen, fire
[15:52:44] <Tallisman> (No pun intended)
[15:53:53] <Eliasen> Ah thanks, I was wondering, is it possible to "reload" or "refresh" jquery stuff without reloading the page? For example, if I retrieve some information with ajax from a script, is it possible to reload jquery so the jquery stuff will apply to the new content?
[15:53:56] <xsamurai> Tallisman: thanks!
[15:53:56] <Eliasen> I hope I made sense.
[15:54:55] <Tallisman> euhm, you can reset the listeners Eliasen.. Actually never needed anything more
[15:55:27] <Eliasen> Oh, I have no idea what they are, I guess I'll go read up on that :)
[15:55:32] <byteme_> <a href='javascript:history.back(1)   is there a way for the browser to know it was hit using the back button or the last page in history?
[15:55:33] <sodapop> i can't use asynchronous ajax inside e.g. a for loop right?
[15:55:52] <imsky> sure you can
[15:55:55] <xsamurai> i was however using type=submit , unfortunately the problem still persists
[15:56:14] <sodapop> within a for loop i create an element $('#loading_bar'+i).html(gif); the i run an ajax request and on success i do  i try to remove that element
[15:56:17] <Hoe``> what's it called when a function gets called multiple times in a row, but should only be called after no call has been made to it for N units of time?
[15:56:24] <Hoe``> I couldn't think of a better way to explain it :/
[15:56:26] <Tallisman> so you want to send something xsamurai?
[15:56:29] <Eliasen> Tallisman, thanks for the help! Any recommended pages to read about listeners?
[15:56:41] <xsamurai> Tallisman: its working fine , for some odd reason it loops
[15:56:41] <Tallisman> euhm, yea..
[15:56:44] <Tallisman> ?event
[15:56:45] <bot-t> Tallisman, Events - These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[15:56:55] <sodapop> does not work
[15:57:11] <xsamurai> i have dynamic selects and depending on how many i have it will loop that many times in the submit function
[15:57:28] <Eliasen> Tallisman, thanks a lot :) - appreciated!
[15:57:34] <Tallisman> np :P
[15:58:06] <Tallisman> define dynamic selects xsamurai :P
[15:59:06] <xsamurai> nvm go it fixed, misplaced }
[15:59:10] <xsamurai> =P
[15:59:51] <Tallisman> :), shuts mouth* i'd be one to talk after 3 hours of debugging because of a mixup of submit and button
[16:00:33] <byteme_> $('#btnHiddenSubmit').trigger('click');             $('#hidden_button').click(function (e) {                 e.preventDefault();             });
[16:01:09] <byteme_> is there any way to clear form data before the hidden button posts data to the server?
[16:01:36] <xsamurai> well the last 4 hours were spent due to not calculating proper increments for a variable , its been one of those long days of chasing small bugs
[16:01:45] <byteme_> want to clear form after user submits but the service uses the back button to get back to the site
[16:04:47] <SkyFlyer> i have bind a click to a link at the bottom of my page to replace the contents of a div that is located by the link.  I have the link as "<a href="#" id="link">" but when I click on it, it takes the person to the top of the site.
[16:05:04] <Tallisman> seems like your page reloads
[16:05:17] <Tallisman> return false; in the click event.
[16:05:42] <abjorn> day 1 of training at hostgator: complete. god im tired
[16:05:51] <Tallisman> hostgator?
[16:06:07] <Hoe``> SkyFlyer: you need to 'preventDefault'
[16:06:13] <Hoe``> look up event.preventDefault
[16:06:19] <Hoe``> do not return false
[16:06:22] <Tallisman> facepalm, thanks Hoe``
[16:06:33] <Hoe``> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[16:06:34] <Tallisman> damn i'm tired
[16:09:03] <Chilaquiles> Can somebody tell me what is going on with my page? When I open my page it shows the links for 1 second and then it applies jquery. I don't know if Im applying jQuery right or what is the problem
[16:11:28] <madhat> in chrome, loadInterface() of rr.js only executes once, which is how it should behave, but in firefox, it seems to execute in an infinite loop. does anyone know what may be causing this? http://frankgoodman.org/backdatup/
[16:15:35] <abjorn> Tallisman: Yeah, HostGator
[16:15:41] <abjorn> pretty major web hosting company
[16:20:47] <[Joose]> Someone please help me out here, I'm about to go insane. I'm trying to use hide() and show() to hide one div and show another when the user clicks a link. Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/DtzSn/
[16:21:04] <[Joose]> I've been working on this for a couple of hours and I have no idea where I'm going wrong
[16:21:32] <madhat> [Joose]: what link, what div
[16:21:46] <john24> how do I move a draggable div from withing a parent div that is overflow-enabled?
[16:23:22] <[Joose]> madhat: Div classes: twitter-profile, github-profile, linkedin-profile. Link id's: show-twitter-profile, show-github-profile, show-linkedin-profile
[16:27:33] <john24> anyone alive here?
[16:27:40] <[Joose]> I am
[16:27:46] <[Joose]> But I'm close to dieing
[16:27:54] <john24> sorry to hear that
[16:28:02] <madhat> [Joose]: have you tried turning jsfiddle to jquery instead of mootools?
[16:28:30] <[Joose]> madhat: No, I'm not actually testing with jsfiddle. It's just a convenient place to show others my code.
[16:29:25] <madhat> [Joose]: http://jsfiddle.net/DtzSn/1/ what is behaving wrong?
[16:30:20] <[Joose]> madhat: It works on jsfiddle if I change to jQuery ... Why doesn't it work locally?
[16:30:50] <madhat> [Joose]: pastie.org your source of your james brewer page
[16:31:20] <[Joose]> madhat: http://pastie.org/2063655
[16:32:21] <madhat> [Joose]: try http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6/jquery.min.js for your jquery, instead of the one you're using
[16:33:23] <[Joose]> madhat: Nope =\
[16:34:12] <madhat> [Joose]: put your jquery crap inside $(document).ready(function() { STUFF HERE });
[16:35:24] <muay-guy> this jQuery("body:not(#intro)").css("display", "none"); will show nothing, not even #intro, and I would like #intro to be displayed. what am I doing wrong?
[16:36:16] <[Joose]> I'm considering shooting someone -.-
[16:36:48] <madhat> muay-guy: body is set to display: none, so nothing inside it will show, even if #intro isn't set to display: none
[16:37:26] <madhat> [Joose]: did you put your jquery in the ready method?
[16:37:32] <[Joose]> madhat: Yes.
[16:38:09] <madhat> [Joose]: and you're using <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6/jquery.min.js"></script>, right?
[16:38:25] <muay-guy> madhat: so the only way to make this work is for #intro to be outside whatever I'm setting to display: none?
[16:38:33] <[Joose]> madhat: Correct.
[16:39:47] <Chilaquiles> hey guys how can I make this effect http://jqueryui.com/demos/show/ to not show when the page loads
[16:39:56] <madhat> muay-guy: yes, the best way to do this in my opinion would be select all the parents of #intro and set them to display: block, and set everything else to display: none
[16:40:03] <madhat> [Joose]: can you link me to the site?
[16:40:23] <sj> I am just starting out on jQuery.  Local changes work fine.  When using AJAX, the page does not work on my local machine, but it works on my server.
[16:40:28] <[Joose]> madhat: I'm developing it locally =\
[16:40:44] <Chilaquiles> bcause when I open the page it displays the effect and then it hides
[16:41:00] <madhat> Chilaquiles: that sounds like a browser issue, but i'm not sure
[16:41:19] <Chilaquiles> madhat: don't think so I have tried in 3 different ones
[16:43:11] <madhat> [Joose]: hm, i'm trying to think. can you pastie your jquery too?
[16:43:52] <[Joose]> madhat: I'm going to try to hard-code my jquery into index.html, rather than using <script>
[16:44:50] <[Joose]> That didn't work either
[16:45:08] <madhat> [Joose]: can you pastie again with the jquery on the page? i'm going to try it on my machine
[16:45:28] <[Joose]> madhat: Sure thing, just a second.
[16:49:11] <[Joose]> madhat: I don't know what I did, but I got it to work
[16:49:25] <madhat> [Joose]: it's working; that's what matters :)
[16:49:38] <[Joose]> madhat: True that. Time for beer.
[16:51:01] <juha____> holy moley, i just sent my puzzle solution to facebook ZOMG
[16:51:36] <jovrtn> is there an elegant way to use a named function as a callback, but pass additional parameters?
[16:52:10] <jovrtn> something like: $.getJSON(url, args, customCallback(data,myParam));
[16:52:50] <madhat> jovrtn: i'd declare the variables before the getJSON method is called
[16:53:19] <jovrtn> yeah they're all declared
[16:53:27] <jovrtn> I'm sure curious about using a named function as the callback
[16:53:42] <jovrtn> $.getJSON(url, args, customCallback); works, but it just gets passed the default 'data' object
[16:54:04] <madhat> var myParam = whatever; $.getJSON(url, args, customCallback);
[16:54:57] <jovrtn> yeah I have myParam defined, but I'm not sure of the syntax for multiple params
[16:55:19] <jovrtn> $.getJSON(url, args, function(data) {  customCallback(data, myParam) }); would work
[16:55:30] <jovrtn> that's exactly what I want to do
[16:55:40] <jovrtn> except cut out the anonymous function middle-man
[16:56:20] <madhat> jovrtn: i don't think you can pass additional arguments with a named callback function, so declaring all of the arguments before the method that does the callback may be needed
[16:57:14] <jovrtn> lame
[16:57:14] <jovrtn> :S
[16:57:32] <jovrtn> thanks
[16:57:42] <madhat> jovrtn: i ran into this same issue earlier today, and i had to work around it :( maybe it will be supported in the future
[16:58:01] <jovrtn> it's not a huge deal, I was just curious if there was standard syntax for it
[17:00:20] <b0xors> someone one want to help me diagnose an jquery issue in IE? :)
[17:09:19] <Layke> Some plugin that I am running is causing constant fetches to site.com/undefined
[17:09:28] <Layke> How can I figure out what is causing it?
[17:10:08] <ajpiano> Layke: are you using chrome?
[17:11:00] <ajpiano> Layke: if so, you can set an XHR breakpoint in the scripts panel, and then use the stack trace to find where it's being called from: http://ajpiano.com/cap/294e57.png
[17:11:02] <[Joose]> FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[17:11:05] <[Joose]> I broke it again
[17:12:50] <Layke> Yeah I am ajpiano.
[17:12:57] <Layke> Thanks. I will try that now.
[17:18:34] <Layke> Fixed it cheers ajpiano.
[17:18:53] <ajpiano> quite welcome Layke
[17:19:23] <Layke> My drupal installation was sending stray line breaks <br /> which was then trying to be ran by the Nivo image slider as an image..
[17:19:33] <Layke> So src="" attribute was obviously undefined.
[17:28:46] <janthony> $("#main-nav a").click(function(){ - how would I combine this with when the document is loaded as well? I tried $("#main-nav a").bind('click ready', function(){ but had some undesired results. Basically I want to run the function when either an anchor is clicked from #main-nav or the site is loaded.
[17:30:15] <ajpiano> janthony function foo() { //stuff }  $(function() { foo();  $("#bar").click(foo);    });
[17:31:06] <janthony> ajpiano: So basically make it a function then bind the function to whatever I want?
[17:31:12] <ajpiano> yup
[17:31:25] <ajpiano> but you can just execute it as part of doc ready, cause you have to wait for doc ready to bind it to anything else
[17:31:25] <eddiemonge> right
[17:31:33] <janthony> ajpiano: Ahh ok. I hardly ever use that practice. Maybe I need to make it more of a habbit. But then again, most of what I do is single event only.
[17:31:44] <janthony> Thanks!
[17:31:47] <ajpiano> yes
[17:32:01] <ajpiano> if all your functions are anonymous functions then you don't know any of your functions
[17:34:54] <Guest86231> i have a question, say $(this) contains some html like "<div> <ul><li> foo </li> </ul> </div>" can i say var listItem = $(this. " div > ul > li");
[17:35:20] <ajpiano> ?concatobj @ Guest86231
[17:35:21] <bot-t> Guest86231, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[17:35:41] <Primer> Trying to help a co-worker. He has a div, #download, which he then does $('#download').click (function {...});, then its parent is hidden, exposed again, which causes another call to $('#download').click (function {...}), but the second time around, no click event is ever registered. We can see there is no click event registered  in chrome's debugger. Thoughts?
[17:36:00] <Primer> Obviously clicking the div yields no event either
[17:36:17] <ajpiano> are you passing the event arg to the handler
[17:37:35] <Primer> the in-line function is passed nothing
[17:37:58] <Primer> as it just calls the method of another global variable
[17:38:05] <eddiemonge> in-line function?
[17:38:15] <eddiemonge> is the parent hidden or removed?
[17:38:17] <Primer> Anyhow, I didn't code this, but he claims this once worked, and now it doesn't
[17:38:25] <Primer> I'm told it's hidden
[17:38:30] <ajpiano> Primer: it's really bad to strucutre your code around like, triggering anonymous handlers
[17:39:05] <ajpiano> in any event that's just not enough information for someone to really help you on
[17:39:10] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ Primer
[17:39:10] <bot-t> Primer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[17:39:18] <Primer> Again, just relaying info here, he tells me he can go: $('#download') after it's "hidden", and that returns something still
[17:39:27] <Primer> inferring that it's been hidden, and not removed
[17:39:33] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: off topic: no -ot for me?
[17:39:57] <ajpiano> i was unawares, will check
[17:40:08] <Primer> ajpiano: yes, I know this...this is some really bad legacy code that we're touching upon here. I'm going to get him to pastebin it, one sec
[17:40:39] <eddiemonge> Primer: jsfiddle is better
[17:43:26] <Primer> eddiemonge: yes, jsfiddle is amazing, but it's unlikely I'll be able to stage this in a timely manner, although I'll see if I can
[17:49:25] <Primer> yes, all this is buried in a ton of spaghetti code...won't be able to stage an example any time soon, but I'll get back to you if I do. Thanks.
[18:11:05] <tomasm-> this might not be a jquery question, but are there any general libraries for parsing urls of various multimedia sites and being able to get an embeddable url that works similar to how facebook works when pasting urls and it embeds a video from youtube, etc? or is that something I have to homegrow?
[18:15:16] <jovrtn> tomasm-: check out http://api.embed.ly/
[18:15:31] <jovrtn> used to be free, I think they switched to a fee scale now
[18:23:47] <draginx> Why does an object position() match offset() even when it's contained within a <div>?
[18:24:06] <jdp> hey all, does .has() automatically call .selector?
[18:24:54] <jdp> i'm trying to check if a specific jquery element is a child of another, i.e.:
[18:25:23] <jdp> var node = $('.something').get(0); if ($('#item').has($(node)) { ... }
[18:25:53] <draginx> jdp: Couldn't you use contains?
[18:26:02] <K1ng> hi,
[18:26:10] <K1ng> how do i do something like $.each($('#addroleform').serializeArray(), function(i, field) { var field.name = field.value; });
[18:26:14] <draginx> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[18:26:28] <draginx> ^ jdp
[18:26:40] <jdp> draginx: giving it a try, thanks
[18:26:44] <K1ng> if field.name == blah.. blah value will be field.value
[18:26:58] <draginx> jdp: try just doing node too instead of $(node) (ur wrapping an obj within an obj :O INCEPTIONJQUERY)
[18:27:37] <draginx> K1ng: not sur eu got some code i can play with?
[18:28:10] <K1ng> you want me to jsfiddle it?
[18:29:08] <madhat> jovrtn: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works#Callback_with_arguments
[18:29:42] <draginx> K1ng: that wouldbe awesome sure
[18:29:45] <K1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/EkAPm/
[18:29:48] <draginx> i cant gurante i can help
[18:30:12] <draginx> K1ng: whats ur goal here?
[18:30:15] <jovrtn> madhat: ahh thanks
[18:30:17] <draginx> what do u want the console.log() to say?
[18:30:32] <jovrtn> I ended up doing it the 'right' way anyway
[18:31:06] <K1ng> draginx, my goal is i want to make it work like var field name = field value
[18:31:34] <draginx> it already does that.. values.perm_3 = "x"
[18:31:56] <draginx> u just want to perm_3 = "x" ?
[18:32:04] <K1ng> draginx, yes
[18:32:10] <draginx> eh thats a stupid request
[18:32:12] <draginx> but lets play around
[18:32:17] <K1ng> :P
[18:32:20] <tbranyen> yo K1ng wat up
[18:32:21] <draginx> seriously though that shouldnt prevent u from doing what ur trying to do
[18:32:36] <K1ng> tbranyen, not much. whats up
[18:32:44] <tbranyen> stomach ache, been on the t for a whle
[18:33:33] <Guest86231> is there a better way to write $(this).parent().parent().parent().remove();
[18:34:10] <K1ng> Guest86231, nope
[18:34:59] <draginx> K1ng: not sure eval() isn't even working
[18:35:21] <draginx> Guest86231: does the 3rd parent have a special attribute that u can identify it by?
[18:35:55] <K1ng> sorry i didnt pick jquery on fiddle
[18:36:05] <K1ng> reload the fiddle please
[18:36:07] <draginx> K1ng: i did :P
[18:36:11] <draginx> doesnt make a diff
[18:36:15] <draginx> seriously just do values.field_name
[18:36:34] <K1ng> i dont think its should be values.field_name
[18:38:07] <Guest86231> draginx: no it does not
[18:38:33] <draginx> K1ng: then be stuck on ur problem l-o-l
[18:38:50] <draginx> Guest86231: then no
[18:39:06] <draginx> ive done a feature request for .parent(3) to go back 3 parents but i dont think they added it
[18:39:13] <K1ng> oh i am sorry :p
[18:39:39] <Guest86231> draginx: thanks
[18:40:42] <K1ng> draginx, sorry. i was wrong :p
[18:41:02] <tbranyen> draginx: isn't that what parents does?
[18:41:15] <tbranyen> draginx: $(something).parents()[2]
[18:41:24] <draginx> tbranyen: I havent tried since 1.4
[18:41:31] <tbranyen> draginx: parents has been there for a long time
[18:41:33] <draginx> i remember paul irish no'ing it
[18:41:33] <tbranyen> before 1.4
[18:41:36] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/dVnnK/6/ Does this look sensible enough?  How I'm setting these objects, retrieving them, and manipulating them?  It's for something event driven, so I need to be able to select a board when an event happens and manipulate it.
[18:41:41] <innociv> But for some reason rowHTML is null.
[18:41:58] <draginx> tbranyen: ahh i see what u did.. u did the [2] for returned values hmmm interesting way of doing that
[18:42:11] <draginx> personally i say .parents(2) should be sufficient (it's more intuitive)
[18:42:36] <Eightamrock> draginx: I wrote a plugin to help with the parent().parent() issue.... I have to dig it up .. I forget where I used it lol
[18:42:51] <draginx> Eightamrock: Guest86231 was looking for a solution :)
[18:43:10] <draginx> I don't normally use .parent() more than twice (usually have some sort of unique identifier by that time)
[18:43:28] <draginx> Eightamrock: if u find i though would still be intersted in seeing what u did :)
[18:43:38] <draginx> innociv: add some html?
[18:43:47] <Eightamrock> draginx: Yeah, I would even dynamically assign ID's if I was traversing that much...
[18:43:55] <Eightamrock> Ill try to find it
[18:43:57] <innociv> <div...>...</div> is html, I thought.
[18:45:55] <draginx> innociv: board.setActive(); leads to no where..
[18:46:04] <innociv> Oh?
[18:46:26] <Guest86231> draginx: i could set ids on each list item, but they way i am doing it now seems to work
[18:46:30] <draginx> not really sure what ur trying to do  but board isn't even an obj
[18:47:05] <draginx> Guest86231: aye, a working solution is good enough for me :) although if ur using a lot of objects and IE u may need to try to optimize it ;)
[18:47:07] <innociv> It's not? var board = forum.boards[args.id];   What am I doing wrong there?
[18:47:30] <Guest86231> draginx: are you on twitter?
[18:47:59] <draginx> Guest86231: no why? I mean I have an account but dont use it much
[18:48:13] <draginx> innociv: that variable is only identified locally within forum
[18:48:52] <innociv> I know.. and I'm only accessing it locally.
[18:48:57] <draginx> no ur not
[18:48:59] <innociv> It looks within scope to me?
[18:49:24] <innociv> Oh I guess I need something where I can use "this".
[18:49:42] <draginx> oh i see what ur doing now
[18:49:47] <innociv> But that still doesn't help me getting rowHTML is undefined.
[18:50:18] <innociv> I'm trying to set html for each row, and functions for each row, so I can select the row and then call functions on the returned object.
[18:51:15] <innociv> .. LOL
[18:51:19] <innociv> I didn't select jquery
[18:52:01] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/X7BYZ/ Looks like it works.  Does my structuring of functions look right, or is there another way I should do this?
[18:52:33] <b0xors> Anyone want to help me diagnose why jQuery isn't wanting to work in IE?
[18:52:50] <draginx> b0xors: flip that question around and it'll be accurate ;)
[18:52:50] <gnarf> b0xors: my reply is "hell no"
[18:53:06] <b0xors> haha I know
[18:53:21] <gnarf> i already spent 4 hours in ie7 today tracking down a really frickin obscure bug
[18:53:22] <b0xors> works fine in chrome and firefox
[18:53:37] <b0xors> im in ie9, but to no avail
[18:53:41] <gnarf> that turned out being needing to add "width" and "height" to the element that contained my element
[18:53:42] <b0xors> although I guess I need to support ie7+
[18:53:52] <gnarf> b0xors: what version of jquery?
[18:54:20] <b0xors> gnarf: 1.8.13
[18:54:27] <gnarf> thats UI
[18:54:30] <gnarf> what version of jQuery
[18:54:48] <draginx> lmao gnarf hate that =/
[18:54:56] <draginx> really microsoft should be out of business within 15 years or so
[18:55:04] <draginx> or out of the browser industry by then :|
[18:55:10] <b0xors> I guess I don't know :(
[18:55:42] <gnarf> draginx: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/114
[18:56:03] <draginx> cool im gonna gitstalk u <3
[18:56:16] <draginx> how did u come to that fix?
[18:56:48] <gnarf> draginx: omg dude, like alert() city across the entire code base until i figured out that offsetWidth was reporting 40 instead of 140
[18:57:02] <gnarf> through jquery-ui into jquery
[18:57:16] <gnarf> then tried reproducing the .offsetWidth in a fiddle
[18:57:20] <gnarf> (which is in the issue)
[18:57:25] <draginx> gnarf: lol  cant even do console.log xD
[18:57:47] <gnarf> i had to mute my VM
[18:57:55] <gnarf> it was driving me nuts
[18:58:01] <gnarf> alerts for like 2 hours
[18:58:41] <gnarf> so, eventually i figured out that when you position: relative; bottom: ...; right: ...;
[18:58:50] <b0xors> gnarf: what are you looking for when you say version? I'm new to jQuery
[18:58:54] <gnarf> in a -10000px -10000px left/top element
[18:59:01] <draginx> lolololol nice :D
[18:59:02] <gnarf> b0xors: what version of jquery.js do you have
[18:59:16] <gnarf> that doesn't define a width or height
[18:59:21] <b0xors> 1.3.2 I believe
[18:59:33] <gnarf> ie7 will shrink the position:relative version to be smaller than it should be
[18:59:47] <gnarf> but not if the container has enough room to fit it
[19:00:04] <tbranyen> 1.3.2? thank god all these years were just a dream... its really still 2006 :)
[19:00:16] <gnarf> b0xors: upgrade to 1.5.2
[19:00:22] <draginx> 1.6! :P
[19:00:32] <b0xors> :P well I'm not developing this site from scratch, I'm building off someone else's work
[19:00:35] <gnarf> jQuery UI 1.8 is locked on 1.5.2 for now
[19:00:37] <b0xors> ill give it a shot
[19:00:47] <b0xors> thanks gnarf, I'll get back to you in a second
[19:01:00] <eddiemonge> b0xors: have you said what exactly the problem is yet?
[19:01:02] <gnarf> hopefully 1.8.15 will have 1.6 support
[19:01:22] <gnarf> eddiemonge: "doesn't work" in ie9
[19:01:27] <eddiemonge> lol
[19:01:43] <eddiemonge> the web "doesn't work" in ie(X)
[19:08:04] <b0xors> gnarf: updating to 1.5.2 did the trick, works in IE now
[19:08:10] <b0xors> thanks a lot
[19:08:42] <gnarf> b0xors: you better like thank whatever god was looking down on you just now
[19:08:42] <b0xors> the initial error on 1.3.2 was "Object doesn't support property or method 'delegate'"
[19:08:44] <b0xors> if you cared
[19:08:47] <gnarf> that statement is "rare"
[19:09:04] <eddiemonge> because delegate didnt exist in 1.3.2
[19:09:05] <b0xors> lol yeah, works on ie7, 8 and 9 :o
[19:09:08] <gnarf> b0xors: that means you were using code that needed 1.4 something
[19:09:22] <b0xors> like I said, im very new to jquery
[19:09:37] <b0xors> anyways, I appreciate your time
[19:13:04] <eddiemonge> how can i make jquery make me a site?
[19:13:23] <tbranyen> give me $$$
[19:13:28] <draginx> $('body').make('site');
[19:13:29] <tbranyen> and don't quit wwf games
[19:14:22] <nny> any kind sole want to give me some advice on passing variables? pretty please
[19:15:00] <eddiemonge> tbranyen: i dont know wtf happened. wwf broked on me with your game
[19:15:06] <eddiemonge> it always said it was your move
[19:15:16] <eddiemonge> nny:  passing variables where?
[19:15:39] <nny> i'm calling a function like this var marker = createMarker(markers[i].getAttribute("time"), latlng);
[19:15:47] <nny> to create markers on a google map
[19:16:04] <nny> i want to pass another variable "info" to the create marker function
[19:16:14] <eddiemonge> nny wheres the jquery?
[19:16:26] <nny> but cause i'm calling the createMarker function in an unsual way i'm not sure how to
[19:16:34] <nny> i'll put a pastie link up
[19:16:47] <nny> one moment
[19:16:55] <gnarf> how is that an "unusual" way?
[19:17:03] <tbranyen> eddiemonge: suuuureeeee
[19:17:04] <eddiemonge> nny again where is the jquery? and why are you doing it in an unusual way? why cant you use the defined way?
[19:17:05] <gnarf> that seems like a standard function execution to me
[19:17:21] <eddiemonge> tbranyen: even now it just says repairing games
[19:17:23] <tbranyen> :-p
[19:17:35] <gnarf> eddiemonge: android?
[19:17:45] <gnarf> eddiemonge: my WWF like blew up and wouldn't let me play anymore
[19:17:46] <eddiemonge> they updated the game and mothereffin effed it up
[19:17:53] <eddiemonge> ipad
[19:18:04] <eddiemonge> no more android phone for me. im on a pre2 for now
[19:18:27] <nny> http://pastie.org/2064238
[19:22:16] <nny> i'm hacking up some animation with google maps api v3, they kindly decided to remove the map.panTo function from v3
[19:22:31] <tbranyen> nny: heh v3 sucks
[19:22:45] <nny> yeah unfortunately i'm stuck with it
[19:24:49] <jovrtn> is v4 out now?
[19:25:24] <innociv> Whao how could they leave out a panning to function?
[19:25:47] <nny> yeah i dunno why
[19:26:02] <innociv> draginx, IE9 seems like an acceptable browser to me.
[19:26:16] <innociv> And IE10 is coming next year with Windows8.
[19:26:21] <nny> to get around it i used map.setcenter and wrote a function to calculate every point in between the start and end locations
[19:27:09] <gnarf> nny: you could use jQuery animate() and a custom fx step function
[19:28:01] <gnarf> you might even be able to do it with a funky cssHook ;)
[19:28:09] <nny> anywho so if anyone is feeling kind. http://pastie.org/2064238 line 31 i want to pass the info var on line 24 to the createmarker function
[19:28:30] <eddiemonge> innociv: acceptable in what sense? that its better than ie6? then yes i agree. as a modern browser? then no i dont agree
[19:28:48] <gnarf> nny: , info?
[19:29:05] <nny> gnarf: I had a go at that but it was a problem cause i'm using xml data for the latlng, i just got setcenter working first. I can pastie the code if anyone wants it
[19:29:05] <innociv> How is it really worse than chrome or firefox as far as rendering html, css, javascript, and canvas?
[19:29:32] <nny> gnarf: tried that console.log comes back with undefined
[19:29:41] <nny> thats how i thought it would be done
[19:29:59] <gnarf> nny: maybe cuz the param after latlng is "markers" ?
[19:30:03] <gnarf> not "info" ?
[19:30:39] <nny> ?
[19:30:59] <gnarf> nny: on like 59, function createMarker( time, latlng, markers, info )
[19:31:11] <gnarf> if you are passing ( time, latlng, info )
[19:31:15] <nny> ah i have to put them in the correct order?
[19:31:24] <gnarf> ?101
[19:31:25] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[19:31:55] <gnarf> of course, parameters are bound to the order they are passed
[19:33:01] <nny> ok thanks man, i'll have a play with that
[19:34:19] <nny> nice knew it would be something simple like that (i'm still pretty noob and dont know my syntax yet) thanks heaps for the help gnarf
[19:37:03] <ColKurtz> hey guys
[19:37:30] <ColKurtz> for some reason jQuery isn't working on Firefox on a few Mac machines here at work
[19:37:33] <ColKurtz> wtf could be going wrong?
[19:37:45] <ColKurtz> http://gunnjerkens.com/cookie/
[19:38:31] <eddiemonge> if(!window.jquery){ alert('no jQuery :(');
[19:38:46] <Eightamrock> gnarf thats actually a really great resource... I wish I had that when I learned JS.... good read
[19:38:54] <eddiemonge> ColKurtz: fix your typo. js(H||L)int your code
[19:39:33] <ColKurtz> ya i fixed that
[19:40:46] <ColKurtz> okay jQuery is loading
[19:46:19] <draginx> anyway to oget position() from two parents away? O-o
[19:46:50] <gnarf> .parents().eq(1).position()
[19:47:17] <gnarf> or did you mean is there any way to calculate what the position would be without the intermediate relative?
[19:49:29] <gnarf> draginx: ?
[19:49:56] * ColKurtz facepalm
[19:50:15] <draginx> gnarf: "or did you mean is there any way to calculate what the position would be without the intermediate relative?" this
[19:50:17] <ColKurtz> I think I forgot to upload a JS file
[19:50:22] <ColKurtz> i was testing it locally and it was working fine
[19:50:41] <ColKurtz> but testing it on the live server
[19:51:02] <gnarf> var elem = ...., temp = $("<div/>").appendTo( elem.parent().parent() ).offset(function() { return elem.offset(); }).position(); temp.remove();
[19:51:12] <gnarf> ^^^ @draginx
[19:51:23] <draginx> o-o
[19:51:54] <gnarf> create a blank div, position it to be in the same "offset" (relative to document) then read its position and remove it
[19:52:20] <gnarf> prolly need position: absolute; on that div
[19:52:25] <gnarf> but that technique should work
[19:52:35] <gnarf> ?offset @draginx
[19:52:35] <bot-t> draginx, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[19:52:39] <draginx> yeah i dont think i understand it / it may not work O_o
[19:52:51] <draginx> may I PM?
[19:53:02] <gnarf> i suppose, but i don't see why you'd need to
[19:53:03] <gnarf> :)
[19:53:32] <gnarf> offset() gets and sets the position of an element relative to the document
[19:53:55] <gnarf> var elem = your element....
[19:54:02] <jonee> I am seeing two select boxes in my combobox. Anyone who have encountered this previously?
[19:54:06] <gnarf> lets write it out a bit different:
[19:55:30] <gnarf> var elem = $("#theElement"), offset = elem.offset(), theParent = elem.parent().parent(), div = $("<div style='position: absolute; width: 1px; height: 1px;' />").appendTo( theParent ).offset( offset ), thePosition = div.position();  div.remove(); return thePosition
[20:06:11] <kataire`> How can this be the case: $(el).index($(el).parent().children()) === -1
[20:07:01] <Jonz> i believe .index is zero-index..
[20:07:27] <Jonz> and el .parent.children.. what exactly are you trying to do here?
[20:07:46] <kataire`> No, that's not it.
[20:08:07] <kataire`> .index is zero-index, but -1 means "not found"
[20:08:37] <kataire`> I wanted to do something along the lines of $(el).index($(el).parent().children(el.tagName))
[20:08:46] <kataire`> i.e. find the index among the siblings with the same tagName
[20:10:42] <gnarf> kataire`: $(el).siblings( el.tagName )
[20:10:45] <kataire`> My intuitive guess was $(el).index(el.tagName), but turns out that gives the index among all elements with that tag name.
[20:10:53] <kataire`> gnarf: How is that relevant?
[20:11:04] <kataire`> gnarf: That gives me the siblings, not the index.
[20:11:14] <gnarf> kataire`: true, but its a shorter path to your siblings
[20:11:31] <gnarf> can you fiddle somethin?
[20:11:32] <kataire`> gnarf: But by definition it doesn't contain the original element
[20:11:42] <gnarf> oh yeah
[20:11:43] <gnarf> nvm
[20:11:47] <gnarf> thx
[20:11:47] <gnarf> :)
[20:14:34] <gnarf> its collection.index( element )
[20:14:38] <gnarf> not element.index( collection )
[20:14:58] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/Q4SFY/
[20:15:02] <gnarf> @kataire`
[20:15:40] <kataire`> gnarf: One minute. I got it to work on fiddle. Trying to figure out why my local copy behaves differently.
[20:16:56] <kataire`> gnarf: Yepp. You're right. Weird that it sometimes doesn't return -1 for el.index(collection), tho
[20:18:01] <gnarf> kataire`: but
[20:18:21] <kataire`> I guess in those cases both contained exactly one element.
[20:18:36] <gnarf> kataire`: http://jsfiddle.net/WqBrP/
[20:18:58] <gnarf> kataire`: thats probably less searching the dom for the same value
[20:18:59] <gnarf> :)
[20:19:25] <kataire`> Ah, true.
[20:19:43] <gnarf> little easier to read IMO too
[20:20:32] <kataire`> Yeah. Also, probably more efficient.
[20:21:38] <kataire`> Thanks.
[20:32:14] <K1ng> any idea what is wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/HXATX/
[20:33:38] <K1ng> nvm
[20:40:30] <steampunkey> hey peeps. i'm manually triggering a submit method of a form via JS. jquery registers it but fails to override. any idea why?
[20:43:11] <steampunkey> i mean the form gets submitted even though i did return false; and evt.stopPropagation();
[20:44:16] <steampunkey> here's the code: http://paste.debian.net/119758/
[20:44:34] <steampunkey> see lines 93 and 94 first
[20:45:04] <steampunkey> BIG_ONE gets called. but event propagation isn't stopped
[20:45:53] <steampunkey> actually... maybe BIG_ONE isn't called at all
[20:45:59] <steampunkey> so it might be jQuery
[20:46:06] <steampunkey> might be that it doesn't register submit
[20:46:20] <steampunkey> does it?
[20:47:36] <steampunkey> aaaaaaaaaa
[20:47:44] <steampunkey> help me
[20:53:18] <K1ng> strange. css are not working :(
[20:53:21] <K1ng> with .load
[20:53:26] <bubby323> Hey guys you think maybe someone here could help me out for a small donation?
[20:54:51] <K1ng> normal: http://puu.sh/2Bbz ajax load: http://puu.sh/2BbC
[21:01:12] <steampunkey> http://paste.debian.net/119761/ <- how are the first and the other few lines not equivalent if function BIG_ONE does: evt.stopPropagation(); and return false; the reason i'm asking is because the non-jQuery piece of code propagates
[21:04:29] <eddiemonge> steampunkey: what are you asking? how to make the normal js act like the jquery version?
[21:05:15] <steampunkey> eddiemonge: yes
[21:05:28] <eddiemonge> steampunkey: why?
[21:05:36] <eddiemonge> not everything supports addEventListener
[21:05:46] <eddiemonge> ?mdc addeventlistener
[21:05:47] <bot-t> eddiemonge, element.addEventListener - MDC Docs - addEventListener registers a single event listener on a single target. The event target may be a single node in a document, the document itself, a window , or an XMLHttpRequest . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[21:06:12] <steampunkey> eddiemonge: -_- for the factoid
[21:06:19] <steampunkey> the same for the why
[21:06:24] <steampunkey> i've found the solution
[21:06:47] <steampunkey> it's (besides return false; and evt.stopPropagation(); for Chromium: evt.returnValue=false;)
[21:10:14] <mr-black_> hey all, I was wondering if someone could answer a question about sortable for me
[21:10:43] <eddiemonge> not psychically
[21:10:45] <steampunkey> eddiemonge: would you perhaps know how to stop chromium from displaying an image when i drop it onto an input type="file"?
[21:10:47] <mr-black_> haha
[21:11:01] <eddiemonge> steampunkey: no
[21:11:38] <mr-black_> so I have two sortable lists that are connected and when I drag from one list to another I want the sending list to be disabled
[21:12:09] <mr-black_> e.g. the item will either go to the other list or wind up back where it was
[21:12:47] <mr-black_> I've attempted disabling sort in the sending list on the start even (which doesn't work for obvious reasons) so I was wondering what an alternate implementation of this might be
[21:13:43] <djQuery> mr-black_: put together a fiddle and I will try to help
[21:14:09] <mr-black_> djQuery: kk will do
[21:15:52] <eddiemonge> unless you have a live link already
[21:20:00] <janthony> if ($(this).attr('href') !== undefined) { - I'm trying to setup a conditional statement to test to see if $(this) is an anchor or not, but it's giving an error in console on non anchor $(this) objects. Any idea?
[21:21:13] <janthony> The error I'm getting is "a.attributes is undefined"
[21:21:42] <iszak> ?has @ janthony
[21:21:42] <bot-t> janthony, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[21:21:49] <iszak> sorry I meant
[21:21:52] <iszak> ?is @ janthony
[21:21:52] <bot-t> janthony, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[21:22:04] <iszak> e.g. $(this).is('[href'])
[21:22:07] <iszak> damn it
[21:22:10] <iszak> e.g. $(this).is('[href]')
[21:22:18] <mr-black_> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/LvWKL/2/
[21:23:54] <mr-black_> djQuery: that's the basic idea. I've tried many permutations of that concept (register some event on start and disable the sending sortable) and it doesn't seem to work.
[21:25:32] <KWhat4> why does width() always return zero?
[21:26:04] <gnarf> KWhat4: your element is hidden
[21:26:21] <KWhat4> gnarf: no, its def visible
[21:26:24] <janthony> iszak: if ($(this).is('a')) { returned a console error of g.nodeName is undefined
[21:26:27] <wahnf> Hey, I'm getting ready to release a jQuery UI widget for tag input. Would love to get some input on it: http://aehlke.github.com/tag-it/
[21:26:45] <gnarf> KWhat4: in the main dom?
[21:27:08] <iszak> janne, are you sure this is a DOM object?
[21:27:11] <gnarf> KWhat4: otherwise, show an example
[21:27:14] <KWhat4> well i did a $('<div/>') and append it
[21:27:23] <vacho> guys..
[21:27:29] <KWhat4> insertAfter acctually
[21:27:32] <vacho> how do I connect code to both onfocus and blur?
[21:27:35] <KWhat4> im guesing that doesnt do what I think it does
[21:27:47] <vacho> how do I bind multiple triggers to same code?
[21:27:51] <djQuery> wahnf: your ul that is displayed is showing the bullets for the ul
[21:27:57] <Brodingo> .bind('focus blur', fn)
[21:28:04] <Brodingo> or something
[21:28:37] <wahnf> djQuery: thanks - the UL that is part of the widget? that's odd, what browser are you on?
[21:28:42] <KWhat4> how can I tell if its in the dom ?
[21:28:46] <janthony> iszak: No, I don't think it is is. There are 2 events it fires on, one is a non dom object (window) for .ready and the other is a an anchor on click.
[21:28:49] <vacho> Brodingo, thanks
[21:28:49] <djQuery> wahnf: chrome
[21:29:02] <janthony> iszak: the non dom object is causing the issues I think
[21:29:07] <djQuery> the li that is part of the autocompelte on the front page
[21:29:14] <wahnf> ahh, ok
[21:29:46] <janthony> I made a function and I'm trying to run different code based on if the function was called from a .click or from the document loading basically.
[21:31:01] <janthony> Any ideas on how I can test against that?
[21:31:08] <djQuery> wahnf: pretty cool otherwise
[21:31:21] <djQuery> wahnf: gj
[21:31:28] <wahnf> djQuery: thanks :]
[21:32:30] <janthony> So basically I'm trying to run if this function was initiated by a click, do this, if it was initiated by the document being ready, do this.
[21:34:09] <KWhat4> So say I have some object $('#item')  how would i insert that after some other object ?
[21:34:42] <ryanseddon> $('#item').insertAfter(element)
[21:35:32] <janthony> Anyone?
[21:35:34] <mr-black_> djQuery: any advice?
[21:35:48] <KWhat4> ryanseddon: thats what i did but apperently its not 'in the dom'
[21:36:20] <ryanseddon> KWhat4: what's not in the DOM?
[21:36:49] <ThrushAAX> janthony: pass the function a variable or flag stating where its came from?
[21:37:13] <KWhat4> ryanseddon: $('#item').insertAfter(element).width() == -
[21:37:14] <KWhat4> 0
[21:37:25] <djQuery> wahnf: is it necessary to have 2 options for singlefield? couldnt you just have the singleFieldDelimiter default to null?
[21:37:26] <janthony> ThrushAAX: Good idea, just wasn't quite sure how to do that. New to building functions that are not part of a bind. I'll look into that now. Thanks!
[21:37:57] <KWhat4>  ryanseddon: $('#item').after(element).width() returns a correct value for the width but totally skrews the placement
[21:38:19] <ryanseddon> KWhat4: element was a placeholder you need to give it an actual element to insert after e.g. $('#item').insertAfter("#id")
[21:38:47] <KWhat4> ryanseddon: yah i know, i did and it doesnt work
[21:39:17] <KWhat4> http://pastebin.com/eCaJ6AKc
[21:39:31] <djQuery> KWhat4: if you dont want people to see it $('#item').css({position: 'absolute', left: -999}).insertAfter(...........
[21:39:36] <djQuery> then get the width
[21:39:42] <KWhat4> its not hidden
[21:40:42] <wahnf> djQuery: you can instantiate tagit on a UL, and specify singleField:true, and let tagit create the singleFieldNode for you... but you might already have that INPUT field, which you can specify yourself in singleFieldNode
[21:40:50] <wahnf> yeah I don't like having 3 options just for that...
[21:41:05] <ryanseddon> KWhat4: hard to say with little code you pasted, can you get a reduced testcase on jsfiddle.net much easier to help you that way
[21:41:26] <mr-black_> anyone have any ideas as to ow to disable a sending sortable when sorting between two lists? I have the obvious solution (that doesn't work) here: http://jsfiddle.net/LvWKL/4/
[21:41:36] <djQuery> wahnf: thats a little weird wouldnt it just detect if I initiated it against an input?
[21:42:47] <wahnf> djQuery: it does detect that. but it also supports singleField for instantiating on a UL, which is why I need more than 1 option for it
[21:42:59] <wahnf> perhaps I shouldn't allow instantiating on a UL for singleField
[21:43:46] <wahnf> but it seems a little arbitrary to disallow that, too. (and historically this widget has *only* worked on UL, singleField and instantiating on INPUT are new things)
[21:44:14] <djQuery> wahnf and how would it handle this?   <input type="text" list="tags" multiple   value="jquery, javascript" /><datalist id="tags"><option>javascript</option><datalist id="tags"><option>jquery</option><datalist id="tags"><option>etc</option></datalist>
[21:45:55] <KWhat4> So .width() only works if a 'width' is specified?  Cant use min-width?
[21:46:06] <wahnf> djQuery: interesting - I don't have support for the list attribute
[21:46:30] <djQuery> wahnf: yeah its new nobody does yet
[21:48:22] <wahnf> currently you'd have to do: $('input').tagit({tagSource: $('#tags')}) - assuming that jQuery UI's autocomplete understands datalist, which I'm guessing doesn't yet
[21:50:05] <wahnf> djQuery: if the singleField stuff is confusing, do you have an opinion on a better way to do it?
[21:50:40] <janthony> http://www.pastie.org/2064695 - I can't seem to get this to work. Am I passing the parameters incorrectly? I'm new to using functions like this. I typically always use them within an event.
[21:52:49] <KWhat4> ryanseddon: issue is that i have a min-width specified not a width and jquery cant seem to figure it out
[21:53:25] <djQuery> wahnf: no not realy. was just asking to put a spark in you
[21:54:03] <wahnf> djQuery: ah well that's welcome too :p
[21:54:27] <djQuery> wahnf: this is as far as I got in my attempt
[21:54:28] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/
[21:55:23] <janthony> Anyone?
[21:56:50] <djQuery> janthony: $("#main-nav a").click(function(){loadContent({ source: 'clicked' })});
[21:57:03] <wahnf> djQuery: that's a good idea for a jquery.ui.autocomplete patch :)
[21:57:32] <mr-black_> I'm going to go
[21:57:34] <djQuery> wahnf: it gives you all the flexibility for the source built in
[21:57:37] <mr-black_> thank you for the help...
[21:58:02] <Brojo> how can I run a function only once? I want to hide a div element at the very beginning, and not any other times in the future
[21:58:03] <wahnf> djQuery: yes, but this is a feature of HTML, so it would be helpful for it to be aware of it
[21:58:40] <djQuery> Brojo: see ?once
[21:58:41] <bot-t> Brojo, $(...).once(); | jQuery Plugins - Filters out all elements that had the same filter applied on them before. It can be used to ensure that a function is only applied once to an element. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/once
[21:58:45] <wahnf> jquery should enhance what's given in HTML, not disregard it and require a redundant workaround
[21:59:52] <jedimind> anyone wanna comment on some interactions i just worked on?
[22:00:14] <djQuery> wahnf: you mean datalist support or you mean a tag plugin in general
[22:00:16] <Brojo> okay I'll try that
[22:00:17] <jedimind> http://42ink.pud.ca/ - the main page carousel, transition when navigating between pages, thumbnails loading into place, etc
[22:00:22] <jedimind> content is obv all FPO
[22:00:24] <wahnf> djQuery: datalist support
[22:01:11] <djQuery> wahnf: does any browser support it natively yet?
[22:01:25] <wahnf> djQuery: no clue - you introduced it to me just now :)
[22:01:39] <wahnf> doesn't mean jquery shouldn't take advantage of it
[22:01:54] <djQuery> wahnf: and there is a difference between supporting datalist and supportin datalist + the multiple
[22:02:06] <wahnf> "the multiple"?
[22:02:24] <wahnf> ahhh
[22:02:26] <wahnf> ok
[22:02:35] <Brojo> actually... once() won't allow me to use the same filter in the future. I want to be able to use hide() in the future, but don't want a specific function to run more than once
[22:02:50] <Brojo> if that makes sense
[22:03:09] <djQuery> wahnf: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-multiple-attribute
[22:03:17] <wahnf> djQuery: wow so <input list="foo" multiple /> really is the HTML spec's version of a tag input field. fascinating
[22:03:36] <wahnf> thats awesome
[22:03:55] <Brojo> nvrm i got it
[22:04:34] <djQuery> wahnf: I wish they had been a little more flexible on the list though  list="functionName"
[22:05:06] <wahnf> hm
[22:05:19] <wahnf> yea
[22:05:34] <wahnf> it's annoying to have to store data in markup, to be forced to
[22:05:50] <wahnf> data and possibly state
[22:05:54] <djQuery> wahnf: take stack overflow for example. probably too many tags to have them all server side
[22:06:06] <wahnf> client side? yeah
[22:06:09] <djQuery> err rather html side
[22:06:21] <wahnf> hmm
[22:06:36] <wahnf> my widget will need some reworking for this :)
[22:06:48] <djQuery> wahnf: thats always fun
[22:07:10] <djQuery> at least yours looks better than mine
[22:07:44] <wahnf> i'd like to drop support for instantiating on UL. but UL is a good fallback for browsers missing <input multiple>
[22:07:56] <wahnf> you have one too?
[22:08:05] <wahnf> oh the jsfiddle :)
[22:10:20] <mafoo__> anyone know why this isnt working
[22:10:21] <mafoo__> <script>
[22:10:21] <mafoo__>     $("#selectPrductSort").change(function () {
[22:10:21] <mafoo__>          document.location.href = '?website=' + $(this).val();
[22:10:21] <mafoo__>         });
[22:10:22] <mafoo__> </script>
[22:10:38] <djQuery> ?p @mafoo_
[22:10:39] <bot-t> mafoo_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[22:11:22] <djQuery> mafoo__: dont think you need href there just document.location
[22:12:00] <mafoo__> no joy QQ
[22:12:32] <mafoo__> i had it in the onchange="" part of <select id="selectPrductSort" >
[22:12:35] <mafoo__> and it worked
[22:12:51] <mafoo__> but pop it in a script brackets above an its borked
[22:13:14] <mafoo__> ie <select id="selectPrductSort" onchange="document.location.href = '?website=' + $(this).val();">
[22:13:20] <djQuery> mafoo__: is it doing anything?
[22:13:24] <mafoo__> no
[22:13:28] <mafoo__> its very bizzare
[22:13:35] <djQuery> console.log?
[22:14:33] <mafoo__> "The first argument must be a beforeLoad event object."
[22:14:38] <mafoo__> on loading the page
[22:14:46] <mafoo__> but i have a lot of scrops
[22:14:48] <mafoo__> scripts
[22:15:01] <mafoo__> lets try deleting it and see if it gives the same error
[22:15:09] <djQuery> mafoo__: so each of them can have thier own .load
[22:15:31] <djQuery> if your script is runningbefore the element exists it aint gonna do much
[22:15:41] <mafoo__> deleted the bit im trying to fix and same error
[22:16:46] <mafoo__> http://pastebin.com/wm8Pfam5
[22:16:54] <mafoo__> thats how it is in the page
[22:19:44] <mafoo__> lol
[22:19:57] <mafoo__> i put it in a $(document).ready(function() {});
[22:20:01] <mafoo__> and it works!
[22:20:02] <mafoo__> Hahaha
[22:20:13] <mafoo__>  /facepalm
[22:20:29] <mafoo__> djQuery:  thanks for your time anyway
[22:45:03] <lijzz> haai all
[22:46:30] <lijzz> hey any body have the solution for the dropdown expand behaviour in IE?
[22:47:16] <atula> lijzz: please just ask quesiton in here rather than messaging me directly
[22:47:21] <lijzz> hey any body have the solution for the dropdown expand behaviour in IE?
[22:47:25] <lijzz> i already asked
[22:47:34] <lijzz> but no response
[22:47:53] <atula> perhaps you should expand your question with pastie or some sort of example
[22:48:11] <atula> I don't even know the dropdown expand behavior in IE.. I generally don't use IE enough to know its behavior
[22:48:36] <lijzz> see if the items in the dropdownlist is lengthy, then in firefox and chrome the list expands so that the user can still see the iems
[22:48:45] <lijzz> but in IE the items are getting cut
[22:49:02] <lijzz> i also dont use IE
[22:49:19] <lijzz> but still most of the people use IE
[22:50:03] <mafoo__> by dropdown list do you mean a <select>
[22:50:08] <lijzz> yes
[22:50:09] <mafoo__> or a jqueryUI
[22:50:12] <mafoo__> version
[22:50:13] <lijzz> i use asp.net
[22:50:26] <lijzz> so that is why i told dropdownlist
[22:50:56] <lijzz> is there any css available so that the list expands in IE as well
[22:51:05] <mafoo__> why are you in the jquery  thread  if your using asp.net
[22:51:08] <lijzz> or any jquery
[22:51:26] <lijzz> you can use jquery inside asp.net as well
[22:52:30] <lijzz> mafoo any idea
[22:52:41] <lijzz> this browsers are really a headache
[22:52:54] <atula> lijzz: this is IE6 or 7+ ?
[22:53:02] <lijzz> IE 7
[22:53:07] <lijzz> or IE 8
[22:53:14] <Brojo> when I create a ("xxx").hover function to fade in a link, it creates a queue if you go back and forth over the link - any way to prevent this from happening?
[22:53:20] <lijzz> both cuts the list items
[22:54:08] <lijzz> the list items will take the width of the dropdown(<select>)
[22:54:26] <atula> lemme test it real quick
[22:54:34] <mafoo__> are they being cut off vertically or horizontally
[22:54:58] <lijzz> but in chrome the list will take the width of the longest item in the list
[22:55:13] <lijzz> vertically ofcourse
[22:55:18] <atula> Brojo: perhaps you can read more on .stop() and clearQueue... something like that... I haven't looked at it for a while.
[22:55:40] <lijzz> but atula did you see the behaviour
[22:55:49] <lijzz> in IE
[22:55:54] <atula> I'm trying to replicated it right now
[22:56:05] <Brojo> hmm okay thanks
[22:57:59] <lijzz> you give a width to the select tag and put a lengthy item in the list whose width should exceed the width of the select.
[22:58:02] <lijzz> atula
[22:58:47] <lijzz> melcow
[22:59:35] <devians> hey, i've got some html from an ajax request. i push it and grab the dom node from the $('#someelement').before(html); call, and add a class. but this doesn't actually add a class to the html, it just adds it to that var. what am i missing here?
[23:00:54] <lijzz> what syntax you followed?
[23:01:25] <SoulRaven> hi
[23:01:34] <atula> lijzz: http://jsfiddle.net/ScLVQ/1/  the max vertical is working on all browsers (IE, FF, Chrome)
[23:01:51] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to enable or disable all elements in a form?
[23:01:51] <lijzz> lemme have a look
[23:01:56] <atula> lijzz: but it seems like on FF and Chrome, the width set on select and option aren't being respected
[23:02:10] <atula> SoulRaven: yep. it's all in your selector
[23:02:16] <lijzz> that is what i want in IE as well
[23:02:24] <devians> lijzz: dom = $("#filtersapply").before(html); dom.addClass('class');
[23:02:30] <lijzz> coz that is a good option for the user to see the items
[23:02:51] <SoulRaven> the selector of the form, or each element in form?
[23:04:28] <lijzz> atula i want the IE to behave like chrome
[23:05:13] <lijzz> devians you exceute that in chrome and see whether the dom is not null or not
[23:05:37] <atula> SoulRaven: selecting the items you want disabled.. for instance... if you want all input with type text disabled.. .you could do something like $('form input[type="text"]).attr('disabled', true) if you use 1.6+ and then .removeAttr('disabled') to enable again
[23:05:38] <devians> the dom var is not null, its a jquery object like expected.
[23:06:41] <atula> devians: when you say "before" what is it the element that is previous to the selected element ?
[23:06:46] <atula> or the parent element
[23:07:02] <devians> i also tried dom = $(html); dom.addClass('class'); $("#filtersapply").before(dom); which works. just wondering what the difference is
[23:07:27] <devians> both the html var and the #filtersapply are table rows <tr>
[23:07:37] <ryanseddon> devians: if you're passing a html string it's creating documentFragment and not an indivdual element
[23:07:46] <atula> might want to do $(html).insertBefore('#filtersapply').addClass('class') ?
[23:08:18] <lijzz> atula any hope?
[23:08:28] <lijzz> select
[23:08:30] <lijzz> IE
[23:08:43] <ryanseddon> devians if you pass you're html string into a jQuery object you can then do $(html).find(".someclass").addClass(".anotherclass")
[23:08:50] <atula> lijzz: http://css-tricks.com/select-cuts-off-options-in-ie-fix/
[23:08:51] <atula> read
[23:09:08] <devians> thanks guys
[23:11:49] <lijzz> atula thanks
[23:11:56] <lijzz> let me try this
[23:36:24] <fire> hi. i have some setInterval functions which are calling $.ajax. But after 10 minutes autoupdating every 2 seconds (chat) the site runs slow. is there a possibility to optimize the interval handler?
[23:39:34] <innociv> Ehhhh.
[23:40:10] <fire> i cant avoit the ajax post because i need to check if there is a new content
[23:40:13] <innociv> fire, are you sure you're not just filling the dom too much?  How much memory and cpu is it using when it lags?
[23:40:27] <innociv> There are also things out there that'll do long polling tings better
[23:40:31] <innociv> like ajax push engine
[23:40:40] <fire> how can i see if the dom is filled to much
[23:41:03] <innociv> In chrome there is a task manager
[23:41:08] <innociv> showing usage of each tab
[23:42:19] <fire> hmm ok, i think its the firebug
[23:48:03] <na3r_> sorry for my dumb question
[23:48:19] <na3r_> what is the meannig of hardcode?
[23:54:46] <Shoruken> is it possible to have a callback on a .attr using it to call a function after it updates an iframe src?
[23:56:21] <Cork> Shoruken: no you need to bind a onload event
[23:56:26] <Cork> *an
[23:56:48] <Shoruken> so would I just put a .onload at the end of my .attr()?
[23:57:11] <Cork> it needs to be bound before you change the url
[23:57:17] <Cork> else it might miss the event
[23:57:29] <Cork> and no its not onload
[23:57:42] <Cork> its bind('load', function() {});
[23:58:00] <Shoruken> hmm so I should bind it to the iframe and it will be called as soon as it has an updated src attribute?
[23:58:26] <Cork> no i will be called as soon as the page has loaded
[23:58:39] <Cork> the src attr update is instant
[23:58:42] <Cork> no need for a callback
[23:58:55] <Shoruken> oh, i was updating the iframe's src in a click event
[23:59:01] <Shoruken> (someone else's project)
[23:59:28] <Cork> Shoruken: i guess you care about the content of the iframe, and not its src attr
[23:59:43] <Shoruken> so i'm trying to do click link -> update iframe src -> callback function
[23:59:45] <Cork> if you don't care about the contnet just change it
[23:59:50] <Cork> if you care use bind load
