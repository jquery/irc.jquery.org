[00:02:28] <resting> is there a good script that tracks ajax history? pjax aside…we need ie8 support at least
[00:05:52] <coldhead> good luck forever, everyone
[00:06:02] <Cork> resting: tracks history?
[00:06:10] <Cork> you mean a list of old urls?
[00:06:16] <Cork> or what?
[00:09:39] <resting> Cork: thats right…so when user hits the back button, they wouldn't navigate out of our page
[00:09:56] <Cork> ah, thats something compleatly different
[00:10:14] <resting> well…i'm looking into this: https://github.com/balupton/History.js/#readme
[00:10:21] <Cork> yup
[00:10:27] <Cork> thats the most common one
[00:10:31] <resting> not sure if there's a super easy to implement one out there
[00:10:36] <resting> i see..
[00:10:50] <resting> guess that should be the recommended one to use then.
[00:10:53] <Cork> most modern browsers support history.pushState
[00:11:01] <Cork> (except ie of course)
[00:11:17] <resting> yah…how sad...
[00:11:50] <Cork> ie is always the last one to get to the party...
[00:16:04] <azbyin> umm.. ok.. i found something weird happening
[00:17:26] <azbyin> see http://jsfiddle.net/qbJGN/   and   http://jsfiddle.net/qbJGN/1/     in the first one, everything is being dynamically created and inserted into the tree, while in the second one only the change handlers are setup
[00:17:40] <azbyin> the output is different between both!
[00:22:52] <resting> hm…don't spot any difference
[00:24:23] <azbyin> resting, err.. did you select something in the category selector, then select something in the layer selector
[00:24:32] <azbyin> then you will see the difference between the 2 version
[00:25:24] <resting> hm…both shows centroids and polygons
[00:25:27] <azbyin> both versions are creating the same document tree! so, i cannot understand why they render differently.
[00:26:05] <azbyin> see the space between the layer and method dropdowns in the static version (/1/) ? there is no space between the dropdowns in the dynamic version!
[00:26:30] <resting> ah…yup…there's a gap in the second one
[00:28:49] <azbyin> yes, *why* is there a gap in the static one and no gap in the dynamic one?
[00:29:33] <azbyin> i think this is one of the edge cases where enter/return/whitespace in the html actually makes a difference!
[00:29:55] <azbyin> i think this is the issue. i will make another attempt now to determine if this is the case
[00:30:01] <resting> the second version's layer menu is 124x18 vs the first version's of 120x18 hmm...
[00:30:22] <azbyin> yes.. same 4 px extra size in ff and chrome
[00:30:55] <resting> interesting..
[00:31:02] <azbyin> you want to know the weird part? check the size of the layer dropdown/span before making the method dropdown appear
[00:31:09] <azbyin> it will be the right size!
[00:31:37] <azbyin> i.e. 120px, then suddenly the span becomes 124px
[00:32:09] <azbyin> ofcourse the select itself stays at 120px width because that is strictly set as a css property
[00:32:22] <azbyin> i mean in the static version (not the dynamic version)
[00:33:18] <LoneStar99> in the following code I need to declare var tasks twice.... why can't figure out why... http://jsfiddle.net/Tp95Z/25/
[00:35:34] <mazzachre> If I only have a "top" values, should I still try and use "offset" or should I use css('top') ?
[00:38:00] <azbyin> LoneStar99, http://jsfiddle.net/Tp95Z/26/
[00:38:42] <resting> azbyin: is there anyway to see the html generated by the dynamic version?
[00:38:45] <LoneStar99> azby
[00:38:52] <azbyin> resting, sure, use firebug
[00:39:00] <LoneStar99> weird i thouhgt i tried that...
[00:39:07] <azbyin> no you didn;t :D
[00:39:36] <azbyin> firebug shows you the live tree
[00:39:42] <azbyin> i think chrome shows it too
[00:40:14] <azbyin> resting, oh you mean from jsfiddle?
[00:40:24] <resting> azbyin: ya i use chrome…but looking at source might find something new
[00:40:30] <LoneStar99> the thing is bottom textarea is still not displaying even with global
[00:40:43] <azbyin> no way.. you have to save those as 2 files on your machine and then load up the local pages file:///
[00:41:49] <resting> ah…too lazy to do that :D is there any difference between the source? i don't believe 2 same source will have different results
[00:42:03] <azbyin> yeah, i cannot see it if there is a difference
[00:42:13] <azbyin> other than the alignment, etc.
[00:43:21] <zii> Try to feed 'yy-mm' to the datepicker format. It won't pick up the date when reopened, can't I really do without the day proprty?
[00:45:54] <pangelovski> hi guys
[00:47:39] <pangelovski> i have created my own function where i get a json result and then create a list. I then based on that list create a navbar and append it to all footers in all pages. However, when i am no the main page, the styling os good, but when i click on the another link, it loses the styling. anyone else experienced the same issue
[00:54:46] <hooloovoo> pangelovski: does those other sited include the css?
[00:54:55] <hooloovoo> sites*
[00:55:01] <pangelovski> hooloovoo:
[00:55:14] <pangelovski> hooloovoo: its embedded pages so i would think so
[00:55:45] <pangelovski> http://pastebin.com/NPqXmCqe
[00:56:28] <pangelovski> the first each loop creates a list based on the json data.
[00:56:46] <pangelovski> the second loop takes the list and appends it to each footer
[00:56:52] <hooloovoo> pangelovski: and does the list it creates have a styling?
[00:57:28] <pangelovski> the first one has, not the second, the first should have a black background, but when i click on another tab, then the background changes to whit
[00:57:33] <pangelovski> white*
[01:04:15] <pangelovski> hooloovoo: fixend it by adding the data-theme to the li elements
[01:06:01] <hooloovoo> pangelovski: umm... ok good. =)
[01:06:06] <pangelovski> :)
[01:16:09] <LoneStar99> gn all, thanks for all the help
[01:18:11] <jyaprgrmmr> Does $("<body>").append($("<img>").attr("src","arrows/"+somefunctionthatreturnsnames(value)+".png"));  looks ok?
[01:18:21] <Rockj> Q: is "keypress" events with ctrlKey, altKey complicated to work with? I try to do ctrl+alt+f , but I see no event seen when I've attached a listener on 'keypress' for $(document)
[01:19:36] <Rockj> send events for normal letters, but seems to have issues with meta-keys, any tricks for it or just need to choose a "hotkey" that I know will be sent by the browsers?
[01:20:54] <jyaprgrmmr> ah it should be body, not <body>
[01:21:27] <pangelovski> is it possible to have a event listener on all pages?
[01:22:26] <Rockj> pangelovski: all pages? as in all tabs in a browser? then no. (afaik) (would be stupid if a webpage could listen for keypresses on another webpage and ex. steal passwords etc)
[01:23:04] <pangelovski> Rockj: I'm thinking about embedded pages that have a data-role of page?
[01:25:18] <pangelovski> Rockj. i want to "listen" so when the user enters a page, set active navbar button to same as the current page, then remove active navbar button on previous page
[01:26:03] <Rockj> embedded as in iframe I assume, I don't know. Maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1654017/how-to-expose-iframes-dom-using-jquery gives some keypointers?
[01:43:08] <kevwilde> hi i am using fullcalendar on mobile devices, but on some devices (iphone and low end androids) the rendering is not done correctly. when i press a button or a link it correctly renders itself. Anyone familiar with this issue?
[01:49:14] <r500> how can i use mega drop down menu from here , to support  categories till level 4? http://www.designchemical.com/lab/jquery-mega-drop-down-menu-plugin/getting-started/#comment-669
[02:00:46] <samholmes> I know nested forms are invalid, but how come it is that $form.submit() on an inner form submits the outer form?
[02:00:47] <NodeX> anyone know a plugin offhand that detects say IE6/7 and adds something to the page that's annoying enough to make the user upgrade?
[02:01:32] <NodeX> samholmes : because to jQuery the nested submit button submits it
[02:01:48] <|pez|> NodeX: A site saying the user is stupid and denies access? :D
[02:02:08] <samholmes> NodeX: What nested submit button? :|
[02:04:02] <samholmes> NodeX: what if there is no submit button in the inner form?
[02:04:35] <blackspotwiggins> samholmes, nested forms are like duplicate ids
[02:04:43] <blackspotwiggins> unpredictable behaviour
[02:06:37] <sasori> what does TypeError: elem[type] is not a function mean?
[02:06:42] <sasori> i don't even have that in my code
[02:06:58] <sasori> firebug threw it to me
[02:07:00] <NodeX> [10:00:36] <samholmes> I know nested forms are invalid, but how come it is that $form.submit() on an inner form submits the outer form?
[02:07:05] <NodeX> that nested button wtf?
[02:07:58] <samholmes> NodeX: I didn't mention a button. The inner form doesn't have a button.
[02:08:17] <samholmes> It has a input[type=file]
[02:08:23] <samholmes> but no submit button.
[02:08:32] <JelmerD> Hi all, I have a questin for jquery. I am using a .tabs() on a div with id="tabs", but now I want to "extend" the function "change". So when a user clicks on a tab, I want to add extra functionality to do some stuff with ajax.
[02:09:03] <JelmerD> It's not to load the contents, but it's just to store the currently clicked tab in a session variable for later use
[02:12:27] <NodeX> samholmes : same difference
[02:13:28] <samholmes> How does jQuery submit forms exactly?
[02:13:50] <blackspotwiggins> samholmes, wtf do you want. you are nesting forms, its not supposed to work
[02:13:52] <blackspotwiggins> get over it
[02:14:25] <samholmes> blackspotwiggins: I want to know how jQuery submits forms. :\
[02:15:07] <NodeX> by triggering the event which is practicaly the same as clicking a submit button
[02:19:20] <samholmes> NodeX: Ah I see, now. I just needed to prevent bubbling on my inner form to prevent the outer form from receiving the submit event.
[02:23:31] <Already> Hello everyone. :)
[02:23:47] <blackspotwiggins> samholmes, no, you nede to stop using nested forms.
[02:24:18] <samholmes> blackspotwiggins: no I don't
[02:29:01] <erdos> hello ther
[02:33:00] <Already> A grid design which has N Items and arranges them according to the width avaible in its parent elemnt would be an elastic grid layout, right?
[02:34:17] <erdos> i feel dirty declaring a function like this: http://pastebin.com/xc0Hj6at , is this as wrong as it feels?
[02:34:43] <Cork> erdos: you mean the callbacks?
[02:34:58] <Cork> or the updateDates function?
[02:35:11] <erdos> updateDates function
[02:35:41] <erdos> is that ok to just chuck in a little helper function there like that?
[02:35:54] <Cork> you should prob give the #menu-item-2 jquery object as a argument to the function
[02:36:04] <Cork> but other then that, no thats fine
[02:36:15] <Cork> might want to scope your code though
[02:36:27] <erdos> put a closure around it?
[02:36:43] <Cork> (function() { /* your code here */ })()
[02:36:49] <erdos> yah got ya
[02:36:56] <Cork> unless your running it in a ready event
[02:37:10] <erdos> i don't think it pollutes the global
[02:37:45] <erdos> i'm using require.js
[02:37:51] <Cork> yuck...
[02:37:57] <erdos> haha really?
[02:38:01] <Cork> ya
[02:38:14] <erdos> i'm trying to get away from this big pile of spaghetti which is my usual style
[02:38:32] <Cork> your moving the package management over to the browser, that results in lots of small http calls from the browser
[02:38:37] <Cork> and that kills performance
[02:38:56] <erdos> well... the app isn't TOO massive
[02:39:09] <Cork> erdos: thats fine, but preprocess it into one file server side
[02:39:12] <erdos> but big enough that if i don't get some kind of structure i'm going to be in trouble down the track
[02:39:21] <erdos> oh yeah i plan on doing that
[02:39:23] <Cork> erdos: a browser only does a few connections to the server
[02:39:35] <Cork> then it waits for the other to complete before opening another connection
[02:39:42] <ychaouche> Hi
[02:39:51] <ychaouche> does jqueyr have an md5 function ?
[02:39:53] <Cork> erdos: thats why require.js is source a bad idea
[02:39:59] <Cork> ychaouche: no
[02:40:06] <ychaouche> ok thanks
[02:40:36] <ychaouche> do you have any particular opinion on a specific md5 javascript code ?
[02:40:43] <erdos> i'm pretty sure the require.js optimizer puts everything into one minified file
[02:41:03] <Cork> ychaouche: why does it matter md5 is completely cracked
[02:41:12] <Cork> you can just as well send it in plane text
[02:41:38] <ychaouche> the API call I want to do requires md5
[02:41:46] <Cork> erdos: requre.js is only in js last i checked
[02:41:49] <ychaouche> it's the server's requirement.
[02:41:52] <Cork> ah
[02:41:57] <Cork> a checksum?
[02:42:17] <ychaouche> no a password
[02:42:22] <Cork> :s
[02:42:38] <Cork> theres a bunch of md5 libs on the web
[02:42:43] <Cork> just google it :)
[02:43:07] <ychaouche> yeah the problem *is* that there a bunch
[02:43:08] <ychaouche> :)
[02:43:16] <Cork> just grab one
[02:43:17] <ychaouche> that's why I ask about any particular opinion
[02:43:37] <erdos> still sussing it out, pretty sure you optimize once before deploy.. but considering my skills i'm opting for nice structure over client side efficiency at the moment :)
[02:43:37] <Cork> if it works find, if it doesn't test another one
[02:44:00] <koiti> hy out there. i am looking for a event which is fired, when the user change to a other programm or a other tab. where can i get such a event? thanks!
[02:44:09] <Cork> erdos: theres js preprocessors for every webserver language out there
[02:44:14] <ychaouche> hmmm.. I guess that's why software suck so bad nowadays...
[02:44:29] <Cork> erdos: or you can have it in your release cycle (and run cmake on your js library)
[02:45:40] <erdos> any suggestions for modularizing code into a nice logical structure? i'm not too deep yet to change direction for this project
[02:46:39] <Cork> koiti: haven't fiddled with it for ages, but i think its focus/blur on the window object
[02:47:04] <Cork> erdos: make parts of what you do objects
[02:47:16] <Cork> erdos: and then reuse the different objects where you need them
[02:47:30] <Cork> erdos: that makes it much simpler to split things up into files
[02:48:36] <erdos> hmmm
[02:49:47] <erdos> but if i want to use the $ doesn't that mean have to do the standard $(function(){}); ... then isn't everything in there closed off in scope? so i can only access objects from within that file
[02:49:51] <erdos> ugh, my brain
[02:50:52] <erdos> oh wait
[02:50:54] <erdos> err
[02:50:55] <erdos> whoops
[02:51:37] <erdos> hey Cork, you couldn't suggest some resources with examples of good design for jquery app could you?
[02:51:50] <erdos> *apps
[02:52:15] <Connorhd> ychaouche: http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/
[02:52:35] <Cork> erdos: thats a very generic question :)
[02:52:59] <erdos> heheh, ok i basically want the gang of four tailored for web dev, specifically jquery
[02:53:50] <erdos> compacted in pill that delivers knowledge straight to my brain
[02:53:52] <erdos> can you provide that?
[02:54:15] <Cork> heh, not likely :)
[02:54:25] <ychaouche> Connorhd, I like its interface much more than Paj's
[02:54:25] <erdos> rats
[02:55:09] <Cork> erdos: if the app is meant to be big (code wise), build code you use often as plugins for jquery
[02:55:10] <ychaouche> Connorhd, do you know if this script is used anywhere ?
[02:55:42] <Cork> erdos: and try to think about how the code could be reused, that makes it much nicer to reuse the code for other sites
[02:55:48] <ychaouche> Connorhd, Paj's was used by some notorius companies, like yahoo.
[02:55:54] <erdos> hmmm i didn't think of that, that's a good point
[02:56:02] <Connorhd> only where I've used it personally, not sure how I came across it
[02:56:30] <erdos> ok thanks! i'm going to go learn how to make jquery plugins!
[03:00:43] <computer2000> how do i put all divs with class "myclass" into a new div with class"newclass"?
[03:00:59] <markus__> i am looking for a event which tells me, that the user has changed to another programm or an other tab. can someone pls help me?
[03:01:11] <computer2000> need to make a container for all divs with certain class
[03:01:30] <computer2000> got it.. wrap
[03:05:48] <erdos> markus: i wonder if blur on the window object works...
[03:06:58] <erdos> $(document).blur() or $(window).blur()... not that i've tried it or anything
[03:08:54] <pangelovski> how come every time i add elements dynamically, the css gets messed up
[03:12:53] <erdos> pang: you're going to have to be a bit more specific
[03:15:48] <majd> hey #jquery - i have a slider with 2 handles. I have set range: true, but i also want the pieces outside of the range to have different colours. Eg. left side red, middle green, right yellow
[03:15:53] <majd> is there a way to do this?

[03:22:07] <w00tner> greetings
[03:22:16] <w00tner> have a nice day
[03:26:49] <Axsuul> When opening a popup window, I can't seem to trigger events on the opener's $(document). Is it even possible? I'm doing...  window.opener.$(document).trigger("some_event")
[03:27:44] <Solow> Any good resources on prototype?
[03:28:04] <j_wright> in #prototype ?
[03:28:13] <Solow> I'm looking but I can't find anything interesting enough
[03:28:20] <Solow> j_wright: I don't mean the framework
[03:28:41] <Solow> Everything shows you how to set something. But I want the advantages and in-dept explanation
[03:29:27] <Axsuul> Nm I got it
[03:29:40] <Axsuul> window.opener.$(window.opener.document).trigger("event")
[03:37:12] <w00tner> wich is the best practice to send data to a mysql db from a jquery mobile form ?
[03:37:40] <w00tner> from native app submit data to a mysql
[03:44:56] <softmanpetro> there is any posibility to associate el.live("autocomplete" ... ?
[04:00:09] <mbn_18> I wonder what is faster $('table.class_name') OR $('.class_name'). Any idea?
[04:05:33] <criix> hmm... or $("table").find(".classname");
[04:09:28] <kevwilde> hi i am using fullcalendar on mobile devices, but on some devices (iphone and low end androids) the rendering is not done correctly. when i press a button or a link it correctly renders itself. Anyone familiar with this issue?
[04:15:06] <zafu> hi, how can I find an element's position relative to its parent?
[04:15:14] <zafu> in points
[04:18:57] <rgr> hmm, why is my js linter telling me to use [] notation in this line? : var whenLikedFn = new Array();
[04:36:00] <softmanpetro> when I click on a link I use a $('.feature').click(function(){ try  {... return false; but It looks in chrome the original link is followed so that I arrive to a unknown action... but I hoped I will only execute some kind of refresh in html with my jquery code
[04:36:06] <softmanpetro> in FF and IE works fine
[04:36:19] <softmanpetro> any ideea ?
[04:38:48] <PlasmaBunny> hi
[04:38:58] <PlasmaBunny> is it possible to use a value between true and false in jquery?
[04:39:09] <criix> softmanpetro: try adding, e.preventDefault();
[04:40:06] <softmanpetro> let me google where to add that ? :)
[04:40:43] <NodeX> $('.feature').click(function(event)  event.preventDefault();
[04:41:14] <guy> area.on('scroll', [event]) and I also have area.scrollTop([value]) inside the event, how do I tell if it has been triggered using the scrollEvent() or user scroll action?
[04:41:45] <NodeX> event.type iirc
[04:43:31] <softmanpetro> still jumps to the action NodeX
[04:43:54] <softmanpetro> $('.features').click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); ...
[04:44:28] <NodeX> you have 2 choices, one is stopPropagation the other is preventDefault()
[04:44:41] <criix> you add the precentDefault at the end of you're code
[04:44:55] <NodeX> preventDefault() prevents the default action
[04:45:08] <NodeX> stopPropagation() stops the event propagating up the chain
[04:45:13] <NodeX> (bubbling)
[04:46:18] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, you can use both actually :)
[04:49:35] <softmanpetro> NodeX it looks every time I refresh the page with ctrl+F5 or ctrl+shift+R in the Network tab of developer toolbar if I look in the Js I use I do not see the last version
[04:49:51] <softmanpetro> any idee what to set to have a fresh js every time I visit the page ?
[04:49:56] <NodeX> I dont know what "the last version" is
[04:50:11] <NodeX> blackspotwiggins : stopPropagation() prevents default aswel ?
[04:51:20] <softmanpetro> NodeX I mean when I do modify some js and ctrl+F5 I expect to see last saved js file in network tab
[04:51:27] <softmanpetro> but I see some previous version
[04:51:49] <softmanpetro> if I open the link in a new tab and refresh it than chrome is "getting" the last js
[04:51:57] <softmanpetro> so it looks like refresh not ok
[04:52:18] <NodeX> Control shift + R
[04:52:30] <NodeX> Releases the cache (in firefox)
[04:52:31] <softmanpetro> that I've tried already and is the same
[04:52:46] <NodeX> then it's down to your webserver serviung the wrong file
[04:52:55] <softmanpetro> ok
[04:53:10] <softmanpetro> thought there is a setting like in IE saying every time I visit the page
[04:53:52] <NodeX> add a QS to your page...
[04:53:59] <NodeX> foo.com/?a=23049832094823049823423
[04:54:13] <NodeX> might trigger a cache change
[05:00:29] <Chuguniy|2> Hi. Why this won't work $('div#main').animate({height: '200px'}); ?
[05:00:53] <Woet> Chuguniy|2: www.jsfiddle.net please.
[05:00:57] <guy> div + #, seems legit.
[05:01:13] <guy> .animate({height: 200});
[05:01:49] <NodeX> Chuguniy|2 : why use div#main ?
[05:01:54] <NodeX> id'#s are unique
[05:04:01] <Chuguniy|2> http://jsfiddle.net/Chuguniy/cfZgU/
[05:04:49] <erdos> you don't have an element with the id main in there
[05:04:57] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/cfZgU/1/
[05:04:59] <NodeX> LOL
[05:05:08] <criix> 1) there is no element with the ID 'main' in there...
[05:05:47] <NodeX> Chuguniy|2 : [13:04:47] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/cfZgU/1/
[05:05:49] <Chuguniy|2> sorry, my mistake, fixed it
[05:06:19] <Chuguniy|2> I see that it works in fiddle, but inside my code it doesn't
[05:06:34] <NodeX> pastebin your code then
[05:07:30] <softmanpetro> it worked ! thank you NodeX
[05:07:32] <Chuguniy|2> http://pastebin.com/MJ9HNG5K
[05:07:58] <NodeX> No probs softmanpetro
[05:08:10] <Chuguniy|2> if I call this function, everithing is working except the animate
[05:08:27] <NodeX> Chuguniy|2 : is it wrapped in a document.ready()?
[05:08:36] <Chuguniy|2> yes
[05:08:47] <criix> should it be #main or #wrapper...
[05:08:58] <NodeX> and <div id="main"> exists?
[05:09:03] <Chuguniy|2> yes
[05:09:13] <NodeX> div#main is not good practice
[05:09:20] <Chuguniy|2> for example, if I will use css() instead of animate()
[05:09:27] <Chuguniy|2> everithing would work
[05:09:27] <NodeX> id lookups fallback to native dom lookups if available
[05:09:53] <NodeX> you should get out of the habit of giving it a tag name
[05:11:01] <Chuguniy|2> NodeX: yeah, it is a tes code, so I use direct select
[05:12:07] <NodeX> still not efficient
[05:12:15] <NodeX> and it's still bad practie
[05:13:04] <Chuguniy|2> NodeX: Will keep that in mind!
[05:13:28] <Chuguniy|2> So, no idea why .animate() could not work?
[05:13:31] <NodeX> it's ntb on ID lookups because it falls back but when you do more complex the chain goes somehting like this...
[05:13:54] <NodeX> $('div.foo') .... find all .foo's then make sure they're a div = 2 dom lookups
[05:14:28] <Clorith> I'm struggeling ot get my .keypress to respond with a multi select box, is there a known limitation on multi select boxes for keypress triggers?
[05:14:35] <Clorith> I've got a fiddle up at http://jsfiddle.net/CmQGh/ of my problem
[05:14:38] <NodeX> where as $('.foo'); is one ... better still .... $('#id .class') gives some context so it grabs the ID first then checks the children
[05:16:00] <Chuguniy|2> NodeX: That is strange, I was watching tutorial from Jeffrey Way, he told that if you use div before the ID or CLASS you narrow the search.
[05:16:26] <NodeX> it goes right to left
[05:16:34] <NodeX> more specific on the right less on the left
[05:16:45] <Cork> well it narrows what can be matched, not what needs to be done
[05:17:30] <Chuguniy|2> so if you want your code work fater you remove div on the left and keep #main, right?
[05:17:38] <Cork> yes
[05:17:44] <Chuguniy|2> ok!
[05:18:16] <NodeX> Maybe sizzle now optimises, but it certrainly used to be .class was faster than tag.class (in newer browsers at least)
[05:18:56] <Cork> NodeX: it didn't in 1.7 last i checked at least
[05:19:03] <Cork> (haven't checked in 1.8)
[05:19:13] <NodeX> I havnt; checked it in ages
[05:19:13] <Chuguniy|2> I use $('#main').animate({background: 'url(IMAGE)'}); on page load, no result :/
[05:19:22] <greek> heya kborchers,  just checked out the bug we discovered yesterday (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8562) and I see that the issue's been closed since add and select are due for deprecation in 1.9, any insight as to why this is the case (why those methods are being deprecated)?
[05:19:24] <NodeX> I had my info from a resig talk a few yers back
[05:19:35] <NodeX> I am probably out of date
[05:19:42] <Cork> Chuguniy|2: you can't animate background images
[05:19:49] <Cork> Chuguniy|2: you need multible elements
[05:21:11] <criix> if I recall in the most recent versions including tag is is faster, as you're telling it to search only divs, not everything
[05:21:15] <Chuguniy|2> Cork: if I put it inside a .click() it will work.
[05:21:27] <criix> divs (for example)
[05:22:00] <Cork> Chuguniy|2: and it will actually fade from one image to another (or something like that)
[05:22:13] <Chuguniy|2> yes
[05:22:27] <Chuguniy|2> but is there a way to do it on load, not on click?
[05:25:44] <Chuguniy|2> For example why it is working here http://jsfiddle.net/Chuguniy/cfZgU/4/ ???
[05:27:03] <Cork> Chuguniy|2: doesn't work for me http://jsfiddle.net/TqdGd/
[05:27:06] <Chuguniy|2> Nope, background won't work either
[05:27:13] <Cork> Chuguniy|2: cause your only animating the height
[05:27:15] <Chuguniy|2> That's odd
[05:27:17] <Cork> no
[05:27:36] <Cork> you can't tone an image background of an element
[05:27:39] <Cork> so you can't animate it
[05:27:58] <Cork> you need additional elements to hold the new/old image
[05:28:32] <Cork> color, height, width and so on doens't have that problem
[05:29:10] <Chuguniy|2> Hm... ok, will try it in my code
[05:29:25] <nFFF> You might be able to do it with canvas, but probably just put it in a new element and animate opacity
[05:29:41] <Cork> svg would be event simpler then a canvas
[05:30:19] <aram535> How do I write <label for="RG_0"><input type="radio" name="rg" value="e" id="RG_0"/>e</label> as a jquery element?
[05:30:21] <adam_lynch> can I check session variables in my functional tests?
[05:30:25] <adam_lynch> i.e. with the webtestcase
[05:31:13] <nFFF> aram535, you mean how do you select this element using jQuery? :S
[05:31:31] <aram535> nFFF: no I need to dynamically build it
[05:31:36] <nFFF> or you can $('<label for="RG_0"><input type="radio" name="rg" value="e" id="RG_0"/>e</label>') to encapsualte it as a jquery object
[05:32:26] <aram535> nFFF: yeah I was hoping to make it nicer :-)
[05:32:50] <aram535> nFFF: .add() ({ .. }) ... etc
[05:32:59] <ansolas> anyone into iScroll4 ?
[05:33:46] <nFFF> aram535, var html = '<label for="RG_0"><input type="radio" name="rg" value="e" id="RG_0"/>e</label>'; var $j = $(html); ?
[05:34:02] <Cork> aram535: you could do something like var batch = $('<label/>').attr('for', 'RG_0'); batch = batch.add($('<input/>').attr({}));
[05:34:10] <Cork> though i wouldn't recommend it
[05:34:26] <aram535> Cork: how come?
[05:34:44] <nFFF> How is that more readable over just passing a html string lol?
[05:34:44] <Cork> cause your doing the parsing for each time you create an element
[05:35:06] <Cork> creating a long html string and then converting it in one pass is measured to be faster
[05:35:19] <Cork> nFFF: its not really :)
[05:35:38] <Cork> if you have a container and add elements to it (ex with .append) it can be more readable though
[05:35:39] <aram535> nFFF: it isn't a single radio button, it's a 10 group of 8 each so I was thinking of a single function that would just create it
[05:35:57] <Cork> but you sacrifice speed
[05:36:21] <nFFF> aram, you can either copy or paste, or write a small fucntion that duplicates the string?
[05:36:29] <nFFF> :)
[05:36:49] <nFFF> Im not sure how you benefit in terms of readbailtiy or speed, by trying to pragmatically create the html using jQuery
[05:36:50] <aram535> nFFF: yeah I didn't realize that it was that big of a hit
[05:41:35] <Cork> aram535: try a js pref run and you'll be amased :)
[05:42:36] <aram535> Cork: my premise was that I had to do a lot if ... then anyway so I was going to take the hit no matter what, but I guess I was over engineering the rest of it
[05:43:07] <Cork> aram535: simplest is to make an array
[05:43:11] <Cork> push your tags to in
[05:43:14] <Cork> *it
[05:43:28] <Cork> then $(target).html(arr.join(''));
[05:43:41] <Cork> then you get both speed and readability
[05:44:18] <aram535> hmm ok
[05:44:41] <aram535> that maybe a good middle ground
[05:44:48] <Cork> js grids and js template libs is a good example of where this has been found to cause big speed differences
[05:45:09] <Cork> aram535: the array part is actually cause older browsers leak memory if you concat strings
[05:45:15] <Cork> (ie to be precise)
[05:45:37] <adam_lynch> Missed any replies if there was any: Can I access session variables from functional/webtestcase crawler tests?
[05:45:51] <aram535> This is totally internal, and the desktops are managed so I know what browser is going to access my system -- makes it a lot simpler
[05:46:04] <Cork> adam_lynch: if you mean session http cookies, you might and you might not
[05:46:05] <adam_lynch> seems like a security issue if it was allowed but maybe there's some way I can because it's my app
[05:46:30] <Cork> a cookie can be marked as http only, and js can't access it if its true
[05:46:35] <adam_lynch> Cork: I mean a specific variable though, not just the session ID in the cookie
[05:46:45] <Cork> uh...
[05:46:49] <Cork> "a variable"
[05:46:54] <Cork> you mean server script variable??
[05:47:06] <adam_lynch> like if I set $session->set("blah", true)
[05:47:18] <Cork> no that looks like your talking about php
[05:47:25] <adam_lynch> yeah
[05:47:30] <Cork> and the client never get access to php code
[05:47:30] <adam_lynch> I know it's a long shot
[05:47:33] <Cork> only what php output
[05:47:39] <adam_lynch> hmmm
[05:47:51] <adam_lynch> is there any way I can write a test to check for something like that?
[05:47:57] <adam_lynch> (i.e. not using the client crawler)
[05:48:05] <nFFF> You could pass it to the client as a var and jsut json_encode it
[05:48:07] <Cork> only if you make support for it server side
[05:48:11] <aram535> forget that it's php that's a server side ... by the time it gets to the client, it's either POST or GET
[05:48:17] <Cork> a php file that sends the data to the client
[05:48:21] <Cork> for example
[05:48:28] <adam_lynch> ah ok
[05:48:41] <adam_lynch> so I have code that's run on every request
[05:48:44] <adam_lynch> (kernel event)
[05:48:53] <adam_lynch> I want to test that session variables set there, exist
[05:49:13] <adam_lynch> so I'll create a simple page that will check for them and output the result
[05:49:20] <adam_lynch> I can them use the web crawler
[05:49:21] <adam_lynch> right?
[05:49:22] <Cork> adam_lynch: if you want the client to have access to ANYTHING that you have on the server, you need to send it
[05:49:51] <Cork> client can only ask the server to send things, it cant grab it
[05:50:13] <adam_lynch> say if this page outputs 1/0
[05:50:20] <Cork> yup
[05:50:20] <adam_lynch> I can use the crawler to check the result
[05:50:25] <adam_lynch> right?
[05:50:31] <Cork> not sure why you would have to use a crawler though
[05:50:36] <Cork> but ya
[05:50:41] <adam_lynch> what's the alternative?
[05:50:53] <adam_lynch> I know it's awkward but I didn't realise there was an alternative
[05:50:56] <Cork> a crawler searches and detects urls on a page
[05:51:12] <Cork> just a test script that checks the output from the url should be sufficient
[05:51:13] <adam_lynch> hmm not a typical "crawler"
[05:51:18] <adam_lynch> just like the one in the docs
[05:51:31] <Cork> yes a crawler is a bot that "crawls" the web site
[05:51:32] <adam_lynch> http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/testing.html
[05:51:36] <Cork> thats where the name comes from
[05:51:38] <adam_lynch> yes
[05:51:50] <Cork> so it loads the first url, and looks for links
[05:51:58] <adam_lynch> links? why?
[05:52:00] <Cork> then load them and so on
[05:52:05] <Cork> why what?
[05:52:09] <kborchers> greek: it is my understanding that it is to simplify a bloated API, you'll be able to do the same thing in 1.9 by just modifying the underlying html and calling .tabs("refresh") for adding a tab and .("option", "active", true) to set the active tab. like the ticket said, you can submit a fix for 1.8.x if you like though :)
[05:52:10] <Cork> thats what a crawler does
[05:52:11] <adam_lynch> why would it look for links?
[05:52:22] <adam_lynch> If I say go to /login
[05:52:26] <Cork> cause how would it find other pages if it didn't?
[05:52:30] <adam_lynch> it will return the contains of the response
[05:52:37] <adam_lynch> I'm not asking it to find other pages
[05:52:37] <Cork> thats not a crawler
[05:52:46] <adam_lynch> that's the crawler in the docs
[05:52:48] <Cork> thats just a content puller
[05:52:52] <adam_lynch> I know what you're talking about
[05:53:04] <adam_lynch> but in the docs, there's a simple example "The crawler"
[05:53:12] <Cork> ?g wikipedia web crawler @ adam_lynch
[05:53:14] <bot-t> adam_lynch, Web crawler - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler
[05:53:16] <adam_lynch> where they request a page, check the response for the words "hello world"
[05:53:30] <Cork> adam_lynch: read up on the term
[05:53:30] <adam_lynch> I know what a web crawler is
[05:53:38] <adam_lynch> I know how GoogleBot works, etc
[05:53:40] <Cork> apperently not
[05:53:46] <greek> kborchers, ok thanks for clearing that up. I'll consider submitting a fix, although it would be a very similar hack to the timeout solution we discussed yesterday. Any idea on release date of 1.9?
[05:53:47] <adam_lynch> but the documentation calls this a crawler
[05:53:58] <adam_lynch> so in the #symfony channel I'm gonna call it one too
[05:54:40] <adam_lynch> so I take it since you're arguing over sometime we both agree on that you don't even have an alternative, I'll just use "The Crawler"
[05:54:58] <kborchers> greek: very soon! the RC has been out for a while. we're just finishing a few loose ends with our new site and some documentation and it will be ready. you can test it out now though if you want

[06:42:32] <YourA1gebra> morning
[06:45:12] <eip56> morning YourAlgebra
[06:45:23] <YourA1gebra> whenever I run this: http://pastebin.com/E0z460V5 I get the error: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: addTabMethod
[06:45:51] <YourA1gebra> running query 1.8.1 min
[06:46:02] <YourA1gebra> eip56: hows it going
[06:46:18] <Cork> YourA1gebra: your prob starts before that line
[06:46:51] <Cork> YourA1gebra: you have a parsing error the line or a few lines before function addTabMethod(){
[06:47:06] <YourA1gebra> Cork: not sure I follow you. There is nothing else in my js file
[06:47:28] <Cork> YourA1gebra: and the file isn't concated with other files?
[06:47:33] <YourA1gebra> ah
[06:47:45] <YourA1gebra> it's included with several others
[06:48:17] <eip56> Not bad trying to get motivated.. Have to finish up a custom shopping cart or start a mockup
[06:48:29] <eip56> undecided at this point still praying to the coffee gods
[06:50:01] <YourA1gebra> eip56: haha, coffee gods are very unforgiving
[06:50:17] <venus_> hello, how can be assign a class to the image in parallax
[06:50:21] <venus_> how can we*
[06:50:52] <YourA1gebra> Cork: It's saying the error is coming from my jquery.min file on line 2…
[06:50:59] <eip56> I know right I already sacrificed one cup now they want me to do a second.... then I will have to pray to the bathroom gods
[06:51:01] <eip56> lol
[06:51:05] <eip56> its a horrible cycle
[06:51:30] <Cork> YourA1gebra: try an unminimized version
[06:54:01] <YourA1gebra> Cork: http://pastebin.com/y59bRuRh
[06:54:03] <YourA1gebra> I get that
[06:54:40] <Cork> YourA1gebra: that just means that you somewhere sends something into a selector thats not a selector
[06:54:48] <Cork> check your strings to make sure they are
[06:54:58] <Cork> (and not ex. an object instead)
[06:55:19] <Cork> $(selector).show() or similar is the cause
[06:55:33] <YourA1gebra> ?
[06:55:45] <YourA1gebra> not following you
[06:55:46] <Cork> put a break point on the error call
[06:55:57] <Cork> then step backwards until you get to your code
[06:56:02] <Cork> that code sends in wrong data
[06:56:13] <Cork> something thats not a string
[06:56:43] <pHero> hey corky how do i trigger a 'close' event on my datepicker, last time u suggested .show.hide but its slow )
[06:57:01] <Cork> $(target).datepicker('hide')
[06:57:12] <pHero> let me try
[06:57:23] <Cork> i don't think i sugested .show.hide
[06:57:33] <Cork> doesn't ring a bell at least
[06:57:33] <Linoleum> Hi folks ! Look at this : $('#foo').html( $('#foo').html() ); The HTML content "comes back" in place, but it seems to break other jquery functions previously attached to it. Any hints ?
[06:57:52] <Cork> Lindrian: of course it does
[06:58:04] <pHero> it aint working
[06:58:04] <Cork> your first serializing the dom to html
[06:58:10] <pHero> just hide..
[06:58:15] <Cork> then replace the old dom tree with a new generated from the html
[06:58:39] <Cork> pHero: then i'm not sure, haven't digged much in datepickers internals
[06:58:53] <pHero> ok tnx anyway
[06:59:00] <Cork> Lindrian: as your replacing the elmenets you bound the listners to, all those are gone
[06:59:39] <Cork> you never wants to convert to html if you want to keep dom state/event listners
[07:01:05] <YourA1gebra> the frustrating part is that I had it all working with append, but then I found out about clone and now I'd rather use that hahaha
[07:01:13] <YourA1gebra> so it worked at one point… but not so much any more
[07:01:37] <Cork> YourA1gebra: you prob just made a typo somewhere
[07:01:50] <YourA1gebra> I'm just not really sure how to do it exactly
[07:02:00] <Cork> you have a link?
[07:02:06] <Linoleum> I can get this, Cork. Is there another solution ? I basically wanted to implement {{mustache.js}}, that did the same. So I realized the issue. (events atached after also break in a bad way)
[07:02:14] <YourA1gebra> old code:  $('#tabHeaders').append($(tabHeaderStr)); // where the header string was an <li>
[07:02:31] <YourA1gebra> everything has the same name
[07:02:52] <YourA1gebra> Cork: what do you prefer, paste bin, jsfiddle, jsbin
[07:02:53] <Cork> Lindrian: you mean you want a template system?
[07:03:09] <Linoleum> Cork : absolutely !
[07:03:19] <Cork> YourA1gebra: 1. a reimplemenated version of jsfiddle or jsbin that runs (with the namned error)
[07:03:24] <Cork> YourA1gebra: or a live page link
[07:03:31] <YourA1gebra> can't do the second
[07:03:52] <YourA1gebra> I'm using jquery with bootstrap and coldfusion on top of it
[07:04:06] <YourA1gebra> so it's an ugly baby to make work like it should lol
[07:04:08] <Cork> Lindrian: you can't really do that except if you specifically search for the text nodes in the dom
[07:04:31] <Cork> YourA1gebra: good luck then
[07:05:18] <YourA1gebra> Cork: http://pastebin.com/mQNRdkfx
[07:05:26] <Cork> sorry can't do anything with a dead pb
[07:05:32] <YourA1gebra> ah
[07:06:18] <Cork> kinda hard to debug code that doesn't run :)
[07:06:23] <YourA1gebra> understood
[07:06:28] <YourA1gebra> not asking to debug
[07:06:38] <YourA1gebra> but more or less asking what  field should be cloned
[07:06:45] <xec_> YourA1gebra: also, show us the generated html (not cf serverside tags etc)
[07:06:46] <Cork> if the error was visible you would prob see it your self
[07:07:03] <Cork> and what xec said
[07:07:09] <YourA1gebra> xec_:  will do
[07:08:18] <Linoleum> Cork : will the solution be to "swap" content first, then declare all the subsequent jquery functions ?
[07:08:45] <Cork> Lindrian: theres two options, 1. do the templating before the listners are bound
[07:09:05] <Cork> or 2. use delegated event listners (so that no event listners are bound in your template code)
[07:09:28] <Linoleum> I think I have to learn the second way...
[07:09:36] <Cork> ?.delegate
[07:09:37] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:09:45] <Cork> ?.on
[07:09:46] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:09:48] <Cork> ?.on 2
[07:09:49] <bot-t> Cork, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:09:55] <xec_> lol
[07:09:57] <Cork> wtf..
[07:10:13] <Linoleum> Nice shot ! Thanks for the doc
[07:10:21] <xec_> ?on(event, selector, func)
[07:10:22] <bot-t> xec_, .live() - Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:10:25] <xec_> rofl
[07:10:28] <sysRPL> hello
[07:10:37] <sysRPL> i wrote an escape plan for julian assange and your reading pleasure -> http://www.codebot.org/articles/?doc=9586
[07:10:39] <xec_> no snack for you, bot-t!
[07:10:58] <Cork> Lindrian: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[07:11:43] <xec_> Linoleum: refer to that last link from cork. .delegate() is deprecated (afaik)
[07:11:50] <Cork> its not
[07:11:58] <xec_> just superceded?
[07:12:00] <Cork> its super seeded by on
[07:12:02] <Cork> yes
[07:12:05] <xec_> right
[07:12:11] <Linoleum> All I wanted was text strings replacement (translation) from ajax calls, do I really have to delegate ?
[07:12:13] <Cork> delegate just runs on
[07:12:42] <Cork> Lindrian: no just run the template search before you add it to the dom
[07:12:44] <xec_> just slightly more confusing backwards syntax xD
[07:13:01] <Cork> Lindrian: your using .load or what?
[07:13:36] <YourA1gebra> best I could get: http://jsfiddle.net/BWJfg/
[07:13:45] <YourA1gebra> still trying to make the tabs work as they should
[07:13:53] <Linoleum> By now I use $.getJSON
[07:14:34] <Linoleum> It's my first ajax project, still haven't dig very deep into it, sorry
[07:14:36] <Cork> Lindrian: and in its callback your using $(target).html(new_content) ?
[07:15:10] <Linoleum> In short, yes, kind of
[07:15:34] <Cork> Lindrian: then you do something like $(target).html(parse_template(new_content))
[07:15:51] <Cork> that would leave all listners untouched (cause it runs before they'r parsed)
[07:16:27] <Cork> where new_content is the html you sent through your json string
[07:16:40] <Linoleum> I first tried to launch this : $('#wrapTabs').html( Mustache.to_html( $('#wrapTabs').html(), data) );
[07:16:46] <Cork> YourA1gebra: don't forget that you need to reproduce the error too
[07:17:03] <YourA1gebra> ah
[07:17:15] <pangelovski> is it possible to have the navbar even when you are inside a nested list
[07:17:23] <Cork> Lindrian: whats the first argument to to_html?
[07:17:39] <Cork> ah, i think i get what your trying to do
[07:17:56] <Linoleum> Just a basic translation, ow...
[07:18:56] <Linoleum> ("data" variable is my json translation from ajax, pairs of labels and actual text)
[07:19:34] <Cork> Lindrian: you can't have event listners in your template
[07:19:46] <Cork> its just not possible with mustache
[07:19:54] <Linoleum> Well, my template is the whole html content...
[07:20:13] <Cork> ya, so you need to store it separatly
[07:20:45] <Cork> you will have to do that anyway, or you will destroy your template the first time your using it
[07:20:51] <Linoleum> All right, that was my next debuging step !
[07:21:04] <Cork> and with that i'm off o/
[07:21:18] <Linoleum> I already noticed that, and tried to store the initial (mustaed) content in a variable
[07:21:32] <Linoleum> Thanks a lot for your help Cork ^^
[07:22:30] <greek> What would be a clever way to rename all the labels of my tabs? The problem I'm having is that I have a facility to add new tabs as well as remove any of the tabs in any order. Their labels are currently numbers in a range from 1 to 15. So if I remove tab 10, I want to re-number all the tabs' labels from 1 to 14.
[07:24:14] <greek> I need to reset their id values as well
[07:25:54] <greek> Do jquery ui tabs have a certain default class which I could use in a selector to loop through all the tabs?
[07:26:36] <EdwardIII> hey chaps, i've got a dropdown nav, but there's a tiny gap which is proving difficult to fix between the nav element and the dropdown, meaning when you hover your mouse down to the dropdown it makes the nav flash closed then open again
[07:26:54] <EdwardIII> https://gist.github.com/5447df6ac12f6975e29b # tried adding the delays to make it hang around for a bit, but the slideUp doesn't wait for the previous delay to complete
[07:27:19] <EdwardIII> greek: if you inspect element you should see something obviously named - but watch out for order of stuff loading
[07:27:28] <greek> Ah ok I've managed to find the class, ui-tabs-panel
[07:27:34] <EdwardIII> sounds right!
[07:27:48] <greek> EdwardIII, yup thanks that's exactly how I discovered it :) Ok will do, thanks for the warning
[07:28:29] <EdwardIII> usually on the manual they have a tab containing example output for all the elems, but i'd still advocate inspect element heh
[07:32:06] <EdwardIII> any thoughts on my dropdown nav issue?
[07:34:10] <pangelovski> is it possible to get all elements that contains a specific attribute?
[07:36:52] <YourA1gebra> got it working thanks for the help!
[07:37:22] <venus_> hello how can i change the background position on scroll
[07:42:29] <pifantastic> pangelovski: yes
[07:42:49] <pifantastic> $("div[foo]") will match all <div foo="whatever"></div>
[07:42:59] <greek> Is there some risk I'm unaware of when it comes to changing the id values of elements?
[07:43:15] <pifantastic> greek: what do you mean, risk?
[07:43:23] <pifantastic> venus_: use the scroll event
[07:43:25] <greek> I'm looping through a list of tabs in a jquery ui tabs construct and replacing each tab's id value, but things don't work as expected when I try add new tabs
[07:43:33] <pifantastic> ?scroll @ venus_
[07:43:33] <bot-t> venus_, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[07:43:37] <pangelovski> pifantastic: thanks
[07:44:08] <pifantastic> greek: if you add new tabs, you need to make sure that all the events are bound again
[07:44:16] <greek> bound?
[07:44:20] <pifantastic> greek: which may mean calling .tabs() again
[07:44:27] <greek> pifantastic, ah ok
[07:44:33] <greek> let me try that :)
[07:45:12] <greek> nope still breaking
[07:45:16] <greek> I guess it's a bug elsewhere
[07:45:22] <pifantastic> greek: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-add
[07:45:30] <pifantastic> are you using the add method to add new tabs?
[07:46:37] <greek> pifantastic, yup
[07:46:41] <greek> the adding isn't the issue
[07:46:45] <greek> nor is removing
[07:46:49] <greek> everything works fine
[07:47:17] <greek> however when i try rename all the tabs (from 1 to 10) after i removed one of the tabs in the middle (ie: 5) then things break when i start adding again
[07:47:49] <greek> I'm not being very descriptive here. I'll dig a bit deeper before wasting the time of the people here ;)
[07:48:20] <pifantastic> greek: cool ;)
[07:50:57] <greek> pifantastic, fwiw, this is the error I get in firebug when adding a new tab after having removed one of the tabs and renamed them all incrementally: "uncaught exception: jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier."
[07:51:00] <[knight01]> does jQuery UI use the latest HTML5 spc?
[07:51:02] <[knight01]> spec*
[07:51:14] <[knight01]> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[07:52:43] <pifantastic> greek: yeah, looks like you're throwing jquery-ui off
[07:53:34] <pifantastic> greek: instead of manipulating any tabs, it might be better to just always add/remove
[07:53:47] <Shadow> Hi, I have a checkbox dropdown that I have changed from mootools to jquery. Can anyone help me get the jquery one working the same as the mootools dropdown, please. The old one is here: http://213.5.178.201/~fisherie/test.php . New one: http://213.5.178.201/~fisherie/test1.php . This is where I got the jquery dropdown from http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[07:54:09] <EdwardIII> heh why am i struggling so much with something as simple as a drop down menu? it's a nightmare
[07:54:32] <greek> how do I change the href of an anchor?
[07:55:00] <greek> .attr("href")
[07:55:22] <PKKid1> greek, .attr('href', newval)
[07:56:13] <PKKid1> greek, without the second argument, it's a get, with the second argument, its a set.
[07:56:41] <greek> pifantastic, yeah so I basically forgot to reset the href of the tabs ul li navigation links ;)
[07:56:45] <greek> it's working nicely now
[07:57:06] <pifantastic> greek: ah, that would make sense given the error
[07:57:12] <pifantastic> greek: good debugging, sir
[07:57:21] <greek> :) thanks for the assistance
[07:57:29] <greek> time for a break! cheerio
[08:02:43] <Shadow> Can anyone help please
[08:11:31] <kiaux> hi, how can I detect when element class has been changed using jQuery ?
[08:17:57] <scratcha> hi guys, when using .mouseout or .mouseleave , is it possible to get the ID or the element that the mouse has arrived in ?
[08:18:08] <imsky> yes
[08:18:24] <imsky> just bind a mouseenter
[08:18:54] <jbeach> event.relatedTarget? Is that reliable
[08:18:55] <jbeach> ?
[08:19:01] <imsky> yes
[08:20:59] <DobreJoe> Hi, when hovering over an anchor element how can I get the link to expand to the containing element, so when a user clicks he or she doesn't need to precisely click on the link, clicking on the whole <li> would work.
[08:21:01] <scratcha> imsky: i don't follow,,, all i want is to return an attribute of the element that the mouse ends up in once the mouseleave has fired
[08:21:30] <imsky> scratcha: yeah so bind a mouseenter in your mouseleave handler
[08:22:40] <imsky> scratcha: you can use relatedTarget too, depends on how your markup is structured
[08:23:30] <scratcha> i guess i don't follow the 'bind' terminology,, i can nest a mouseenter event handler inside the mouseleave,,, but presumably i need a selector ?
[08:24:17] <rgr> can a script snippet somehow reference the previous element? eg <div>blah</div><script> code here to access the previous div</script>
[08:29:27] <rgr> whats the best/recommended way to select based on user data attributes e.g find the element where data-pkey="value" ?
[08:29:37] <neohunter> Hey, how i can come back to the first selector?
[08:29:54] <neohunter> $(selector).find(smtg).find(something).reset()
[08:29:59] <neohunter> i know reset is not the method
[08:30:06] <neohunter> but there is one method to return the original selector
[08:30:08] <neohunter> anyone?
[08:30:47] <jbeach> .end()
[08:30:51] <jbeach> instead of .reset()
[08:31:43] <neohunter> jbeach: right, thanks
[08:32:55] <jbeach> rgr $('[data-pkey=" + value + "]')
[08:33:08] <rgr> thanks, just found that ;)
[08:38:46] <rmill> $.fn.reset = function() { return this.end() }
[08:38:47] <rmill> :s
[08:45:13] <dabear> rmill: $.fn.reset = $.fn.end
[08:45:21] <dabear> but why would you need that? :p
[08:45:56] <rmill> I know, I was kidding.
[08:46:42] <dogarrhea2> so, what's the difference between jquery long polling and comet plugin?
[08:47:20] <dogarrhea2> http://www.pasteall.org/35152 specifically with this code and some comet like thingy.. is there any difference?
[08:47:41] <the_jeebster> hey guys, I'm trying to pass a header along with data in a jquery .post request. do I throw the header information in the data hash?
[08:50:09] <bjensen> how can I see which event types are supported for on() ?
[08:50:18] <bjensen> Im trying to use on("change") for my select
[08:50:34] <nerk> hello, I am looking for something that can search for defined style declarations based off element IDs/Classes.  eg.. a way to see what .blue has defined in a stylesheet?
[08:51:10] <nerk> I have some methods, plugins that let me kind of do the reverse,  look for style values based on passed style properties.
[08:51:34] <nerk> but I don't want I'd like to be able to retreive the style properties pragmatically.
[08:51:58] <nerk> -"don't want" :)
[08:52:28] <dabear> ?mdc getcomputedstyle @ nerk
[08:52:34] <nerk> nope
[08:52:36] <bot-t> nerk, window.getComputedStyle | MDN - getComputedStyle() gives the final used values of all the CSS properties of an element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.getComputedStyle
[08:52:43] <nerk> it returns all properties
[08:53:00] <nerk> and since most properties are inherited.. doesn't give me what is simply defined in a stylesheet
[08:53:11] <rgr> what are the pros and cons of keeping "data" (could be a json string) in the data object e.g el.data("jsoneevent",jsonvar); as opposed to just storing it in a hidden div?
[08:53:26] <dabear> ?mdc document.stylesheet @ nerk
[08:53:32] <bot-t> nerk, document.styleSheets | MDN - Returns a list of stylesheet objects for stylesheets explicitly linked into or embedded in a document. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.styleSheets
[08:53:53] <nerk> hrrm, that may be a better way.. but I believe there are caveats with document.stylesheet depending on browser and browser version
[08:54:18] <dabear> yep, you gotta use another api for ie :p
[08:54:26] <dabear> old IE atleast
[08:54:27] <faraway> nerk: currently working on exact this ;)
[08:54:30] <soahccc> I hope I didn't get slapped now but how can I visualize protectedSource in ckeditor? The code is only visible in Sourceview but I'd like to indicate this output producing code in the normal view… As I use jQuery overall I see this as on topic ._. Hope someone has an idea
[08:55:16] <nerk> faraway: really
[08:55:18] <nerk> getting close?
[08:55:45] <nerk> old IE might not be a concern.. what would be considered old IE when it comes to document.stylesheets?
[08:55:49] <nerk> ie7 and up is fine
[08:56:17] <faraway> nerk: yes getting clode, give me a sek
[08:56:23] <nerk> sweet
[08:56:56] <nerk> I have a HTML2PDF library.. but it seems to want all styling to be inline
[08:57:12] <nerk> and fuck that.. I would prefer to find a way to pragmatically read the styles from the sheets and set inline styles that way
[08:57:15] <dabear> nerk: anything below ie9 requires special coding
[08:57:22] <nerk> shit
[08:57:23] <rpcesar> does anyone know of a means to force jquery mobile selects to open in a new page?
[08:57:34] <nerk> excuse the language.. twice.
[08:57:44] <rpcesar> im getting inconsistancies in this behavior across chrome and IE, and it impacts visibility of elements and how to remedy them
[08:58:01] <rpcesar> Is there something i can do to force it full page
[08:58:15] <dabear> nerk: compat table here: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_css.html
[08:58:30] <nerk> tx dabear
[09:00:59] <nerk> dabear: seems this may work for IE conditional .. document.styleSheets[1].cssText
[09:01:11] <nerk> it returns the full text and IE's support that
[09:01:29] <nerk> I could parse it and build a hash of the declarations
[09:01:59] <nerk> then look at elements for classes/id's and inject inline styles based off matching rules
[09:02:01] <nerk> something like that
[09:05:37] <Dev27> Hey all.  Newbie here.  I'm having difficulty combining the draggable and selectable behaviors.  I am able to get them to work individually, but combining them breaks selection.  Can anyone enlighten me or point me in the right direction?  I threw together a quick fiddle for it: http://jsfiddle.net/2brJh/
[09:09:15] <Dev27> I've googled every possible combination I can think of and looked at dozens of pages, but I haven't seen anything super helpful.  Any guidance would be much appreciated.
[09:16:05] <Dev27> Hey all.  Newbie here.  I'm having difficulty combining the draggable and selectable interactions.

[09:24:16] <rgr> I have a div with a hover : this pops up a toolbar which can and oftrnd does overlap the next div of the same class. Whats the jquery aproach to stopping the hover on the next element if the hover from the previous hasnt closed?
[09:31:41] <tash> what would the equivalent be of php's strtotime?
[09:32:00] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't have one
[09:32:11] <tash> or, maybe I don't need to go that route. I need to see if a date is older than today
[09:33:05] <faraway> tash: http://momentjs.com/
[09:42:51] <YourA1gebra> how would you set the id of something via jquery…
[09:43:22] <astropirate> YourA1gebra, $(myElement).attr('id', myAwesomeNewId);
[09:44:22] <YourA1gebra> okay
[09:44:37] <YourA1gebra> so how would I set the following's ID… <div class="tab-pane active" data-toggle="tab" id="#x.getAccountID()#">
[09:45:42] <YourA1gebra> I'm adding tabs dynamically and in my javascript I'm setting the href values  to the id
[09:47:31] <YourA1gebra> I'm cloning the tabs initially, then doing an ajax call to get the new tab id (which is working fine), and then now I need to set the id to the tabs
[09:51:47] <s34n> if I pass a settings object to $.ajax with something like {url: 'something', data: {url: 'something else'}}  the data.url is overriding the url.
[09:52:14] <s34n> I thought the data was supposed to be turned into a query string and tacked onto the url
[09:57:00] <s34n> doh! nm. That's not what's happening at all.
[09:59:25] <Dev-Brian> hello
[10:13:38] <nerk> woot, I built something that returns a hash of all defined css declarations available in stylesheets.. then it maps it onto the matching elements into inline styles.  Thanks dabear for that link, aided in building it.
[10:14:17] <starsinmypockets> I'm adding some jquery rules to a fieldset that can be repeated by an ajax call... I'm using document ready... My rules are applied to the first fieldset, but not those loaded by ajax..
[10:22:57] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: What is a jQuery rule?
[10:29:00] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - If i add $('.myselector').action(), how can I insure that action() is applied to myselector when added to the dom via ajax, subsequent to page load?
[10:29:39] <pachet> :[
[10:34:15] <MistuhKurtz> starsinmypockets, are you binding an event?
[10:34:20] <MistuhKurtz> like click
[10:34:29] <dan_> guys i want the textbox.change() to fire without loosing the focus , how to implement that ?
[10:36:53] <MistuhKurtz> dan_, maybe this will work: $('textarea').on('change', function(){ $(this).focus(); });
[10:37:11] <antgel> hi all.  have an issue centering a jquery ui dialog.  after dialog creation (hidden), content is added via ajax. when i call .dialog('open'), the dialog isn't centered (based on the divs i've added). how can i manually get the dialog to center itself without having to recreate it every time (my app just shows and hides dialogs as necessary)
[10:37:27] <dan_> having jquery to loose out the focus for change() is absolutely stupid
[10:37:44] <MistuhKurtz> change might be triggered on blur though (which is the opposite of focus)
[10:39:14] <starsinmypockets> MistuhKurtz = hiding elements pending a button click
[10:39:20] <antgel> dan_: was that for me?
[10:39:33] <phillijw> When I click button A, I want to have jquery trigger the click event on button B. I have this set up but it's not working: $('btnB').click();
[10:39:43] <dan_> no
[10:40:01] <MistuhKurtz> starsinmypockets, in your function bound to the event, if you have a jquery selector it will select whichever DOM nodes are currently present
[10:40:03] <peterschmidler> I got a working image slideshow function which I would like to apply to several slideshows on the same page. When i pass the id of the desired slideshow with the function it doesn't work anymore and I don't know why. http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FCHbn  Who can help?
[10:40:04] <MistuhKurtz> so yes it should work fine
[10:40:41] <antgel> ignore me ^^^, bug - was accidentally adding divs after opening dialog *blush*
[10:41:32] <starsinmypockets> MistuhKurtz - The problem is that the ajax-loaded part of the dom isn't being hidden initially...
[10:42:03] <peterschmidler> ^ Here's the working version: http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/cifkl
[10:42:08] <MistuhKurtz> starsinmypockets, why not hide the container you load the AJAX content into
[10:43:29] <YourA1gebra> I'm cloning this li called "tabHead" <li id="tabHead" class="active"><a href="#1" data-toggle="tab">Customer 1</a></li>  and need to change the a href inside of it… how would I do that with query?
[10:43:52] <YourA1gebra> the new tab is called "addTab"
[10:43:52] <Eviltwin> $("#tabHead a").attr("href", ...)
[10:44:06] <YourA1gebra> thanks!
[10:44:27] <YourA1gebra> even though the new tab that's being cloned is called "addTab"
[10:44:48] <Eviltwin> No then it would be $("#addTab a").attr("href", ...)
[10:44:56] <Eviltwin> Or operate on the clone when you're making it
[10:45:02] <YourA1gebra> ?
[10:45:32] <Eviltwin> $("#tabHead").clone().attr("id", "addTab").find("a").attr("href", ...).end().insertAfter("#tabHead")
[10:46:42] <YourA1gebra> I'll give it a go
[10:47:38] <YourA1gebra> I'll keep playing with it
[10:47:39] <YourA1gebra> thanks!
[10:49:10] <peterschmidler> Who can give me a hint, how I can modify this function, so that I can select, which slideshow on the page plays, passing the id with the function? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/cifkl
[10:53:08] <Eviltwin> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jugLp ?
[10:53:27] <YourA1gebra> Eviltwin: so to change the value and instead of saying "Customer 1"… would it just be $("#addTab a").attr("value", newStr);	
[10:53:36] <YourA1gebra> no?
[10:54:10] <rgr> calling formelement.serializeArray any select objects are not included in the result. Why is that?
[10:54:25] <datarecall> I am doing a ajax request: http://paste2.org/p/2212034 the data is getting returned and info is being set to data but error: is also being thrown any way to figure out what the error is
[10:54:32] <Eviltwin> YourA1gebra: That would be how you could change the value attribute you want .text()
[10:54:40] <YourA1gebra> oh gotcha
[10:55:00] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[10:55:02] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ datarecall
[10:55:03] <bot-t> datarecall, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41

[10:56:58] <Shadow> Hi, I have a checkbox dropdown that I have changed from mootools to jquery. Can anyone help me get the jquery one working the same as the mootools dropdown, please. The old one is here: http://213.5.178.201/~fisherie/test.php . New one: http://213.5.178.201/~fisherie/test1.php . This is where I got the jquery dropdown from http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[10:57:25] <Eviltwin> rgr: http://jsfiddle.net/m8TwZ/
[10:57:48] <datarecall> Eviltwin it is not a crossdomain the error being thrown is a parse error it seems
[10:57:57] <rgr> thanks, but I was too hasty. I found the problem ... I hadnt included the select in the element selector. Minus points for me.
[10:59:48] <jscheel>  hey guys, can anyone tell me how to properly override a jquery ui widget plugin? I know I can override a widget's methods  with $.widget, but I'm not sure if the same applies to $.ui.plugin
[11:00:00] <Eviltwin> rgr: Yes please spend a little more time poking at the code in the future before running in here saying there's a jQuery bug :P
[11:00:29] <Eviltwin> jscheel: Pretty sure you can use $.widget to override UI plugins
[11:00:49] <rgr> heh, it was one of those where Id been looking at it and related issues for so long I was blind .. posting my Q triggered the brain ;)
[11:01:10] <Eviltwin> rgr: Sounds like you need an empty channel to post Qs in then :P
[11:01:22] <Gambit-> IRC is a pretty good rubber duck
[11:01:31] <Gambit-> since almost always everyone is idle
[11:04:44] <jscheel> Eviltwin: hmm, I'm not sure how that would work though. I see the plugin in $.widgetname().plugins.eventmethod[index]
[11:05:04] <Eviltwin> That is not the right way to get to that
[11:05:10] <jscheel> Eviltwin: which I am guessing is how $.ui.add works. I assume $.ui.call looks at a ref hash
[11:05:27] <peterschmidler> How can I stop the slideshow? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/cHlik
[11:05:36] <Eviltwin> jscheel: Page through this: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[11:05:54] <the_jeebster> is it possible to daisy chain ajax calls in jquery? I'm using a post() method and within the anonymous callback funcion, I'm making a get request to another url. this seems to not be working properly but I wanted to check that this is possible in jquery before I diagnose my code
[11:06:38] <ak> the_jeebster: it is possible
[11:07:07] <the_jeebster> ak: cool, I thought so. just wanted to double check since my breakpoints aren't catching
[11:08:12] <ak> the ajax callback is just some function, nothing "special" about it, you can place inthere whatever you want
[11:08:45] <jscheel> Eviltwin: thanks, that's a great resource. I'm still a bit iffy on how to handle ui plugins though. For example, I want to override the scroll plugin that is attached to jquery ui draggable
[11:08:54] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fcnBq
[11:09:24] <Eviltwin> jscheel: It talks about overriding plugins at one point in there
[11:09:25] <jscheel> Eviltwin: I am extending the whole draggable widget the way this slideshow discusses (though I may be misunderstanding how super works)
[11:09:38] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: THANKS, man!
[11:12:22] <YourA1gebra> Another question… if I'm cloning this <div class="tab-content" id="tabContent"><div class="tab-pane" data-toggle="tab" id="1">…..</div></div> and I'm trying to change the id from 1 to another variable… why wouldn't the following work: 	$('.tabContent:last').clone().attr("id", "addContent").find("tab-pane").attr("id", msg.AccountID).end().insertAfter('.tabContent:last');
[11:14:09] <YourA1gebra> or what am I missing / getting confused on
[11:15:23] <jscheel> Eviltwin: I may be blind, but I'm not seeing anything in here about modifying plugins that are attached to widgets
[11:19:09] <YourA1gebra> or would this work? 			$("#addContent tab-pane").attr('id', msg.AccountID);
[11:20:56] <Eviltwin> YourA1gebra: .find("tab-pane") looks for a <tab-pane> element as a child
[11:21:02] <Eviltwin> I imagine you're actually trying to look by class
[11:21:09] <Eviltwin> Which would be .find(".tab-pane")
[11:21:30] <YourA1gebra> yes
[11:21:39] <YourA1gebra> because the ID is already in use
[11:21:51] <jscheel> Eviltwin: interesting, I'm looking through jquery ui's source, any there are some notes that $.ui.plugin is deprecated in 1.9, event though draggable is still using it in 1.9
[11:22:24] <YourA1gebra> Eviltwin: after I clone it… #AddContent should be in the DOM, correct?
[11:22:32] <YourA1gebra> #addContent***
[11:23:07] <Eviltwin> No
[11:23:09] <YourA1gebra> so i should be able to do $("#addContent").find("tab-pane").val(msg.AccountID);
[11:23:11] <Eviltwin> Not until you insert it
[11:23:22] <YourA1gebra> ahhhh
[11:23:32] <YourA1gebra> it's being inserted
[11:23:38] <YourA1gebra> as seen here: 			$('.tabContent:last').clone().attr("id", "addContent").end().insertAfter('.tabContent:last');
[11:25:53] <Eviltwin> YourA1gebra: http://jsfiddle.net/q9whJ/
[11:26:48] <YourA1gebra> Eviltwin: ahhh. that's easier to read
[11:28:51] <SparK_BR> Hello $ World!
[11:30:50] <YourA1gebra> Eviltwin: is it legal to have multiple .find()'s?
[11:31:10] <YourA1gebra> or would i have to delimit each of them with an .end()
[11:31:18] <YourA1gebra> .find().end.find().end
[11:31:27] <Eviltwin> Depends on where you're trying to look from
[11:32:05] <SparK_BR> question: both usage ideas and feature brainstorms discussions are held in this same channel or we have separate channels for it?

[11:38:52] <YourA1gebra> gotcha
[11:41:19] <Eviltwin> YourA1gebra: It goes back to whatever collection you had before your last .find() etc
[11:41:23] <YourA1gebra> ah
[11:41:24] <Eviltwin> Your last traversal
[11:45:24] <YourA1gebra> Eviltwin: okay, I'm trying this again for the sake of learning. Rather than using id's… I'm using classes.
[11:45:42] <YourA1gebra> I would assume it's the same, but using # rather than .'s...
[11:45:52] <Eviltwin> Pretty much
[11:46:07] <Eviltwin> These are the selectors you can use: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:47:08] <YourA1gebra> if that's the case… then I'm doing it backwards
[11:47:19] <YourA1gebra> the link you sent said that classes are .class and id's would be #id
[11:48:44] <YourA1gebra> can't be right… just tried it and it's removing divs
[11:48:45] <YourA1gebra> lol
[11:49:08] <YourA1gebra> not saying it's wrong, but saying something that I"m doing is incorrect

[12:03:56] <bigLanky> thats what i have now... but when i try to select a child item, the menu goes away immediately
[12:03:59] <YourA1gebra> when I do that, it removes a div

[12:13:10] <Zmax> Hi there. Is there anyone who used jqplot plugin?
[12:15:04] <bjensen> can I use .on() with select option change?
[12:16:06] <peterschmidler> I would like my slideshow function to fade back to the first image when it gets stopped. Unfortunately there's some strange behavior fading over white when I stop it now. Who would be so kind and have a look at my script? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/hFHtJ
[12:16:38] <Blaster> Hi guys, I'm  just wondering how come when you click on the red box it says that the function test() is not defined?  http://jsfiddle.net/MN5DY/
[12:17:01] <Blaster> bjensen: $(document).on('change','select',function() { ... });
[12:18:21] <bjensen> Blaster: cool thanks mate
[12:20:17] <stewbydoo> anyone know if there is a jquery plugin that can generate a preview of an image?
[12:22:38] <SparK_BR> stewbydoo, you can use the easyToolTip but it will load the whole image anyway
[12:23:01] <stewbydoo> yea, not really what I'm looking for. I guess I'll roll my own
[12:23:15] <SparK_BR> you don't wanna load the image?
[12:23:33] <SparK_BR> only a "small" version of it?
[12:23:50] <phillijw> how can I simulate a button click? .click and .trigger are not working
[12:23:52] <stewbydoo> I'm more looking to use this for SVG previewing than image previewing
[12:24:19] <SparK_BR> you can use php to generate a thumbnail, because js is client-side you will have to load the full image anyway
[12:24:50] <SparK_BR> if you are worried about performance, of couse
[12:33:00] <peterschmidler> I have this slideshow where I want the user to be able to stop, which should trigger the slideshow to move back to the first image.

Can anyone help? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/hFHtJ
[12:49:14] <the_jeebster> anyone familiar with the change() function? I have it bound to a DOM element but I only want it to kick in when this element has been changed. it seems to be loaded on page load
[12:50:16] <xec> the_jeebster: the change event is for input fields, like when you change text in a textfield
[12:52:49] <the_jeebster> xec: I have this bound to an input field
[12:53:25] <NoiseEee> the_jeebster: and it doesn't fire until it loses focus
[12:53:33] <NoiseEee> (for text inputs anyways)
[12:54:10] <xec> that too, but it shouldnt fire on page load, maybe you have a typo like .change(myHandler())
[12:54:18] <xec> ?demo @ the_jeebster
[12:54:18] <bot-t> the_jeebster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:55:07] <the_jeebster> xec: it's in coffeescript. you want the js output or coffee?
[12:55:17] <xec> plain js please

[12:57:22] <the_jeebster> xec: http://pastebin.com/JYAknkyr
[12:57:57] <the_jeebster> I've set a breakpoint on line 6 and it seems to hit immediately when the page is loaded
[12:58:45] <xec> whats up with the return there
[12:59:07] <the_jeebster> coffeescript compiled to javascript
[12:59:41] <the_jeebster> shouldn't affect the code
[13:01:04] <fusion27> Ok, so we're able to curl a json request from the bash command line, but when we try to make that same request with jQuery, we get an internal server error
[13:01:04] <fusion27> http://pastie.org/4703701
[13:01:25] <fusion27> any ideas?
[13:01:57] <fusion27> the curl is coming from my laptop, the jquery is coming from a mobile phone
[13:02:15] <fusion27> we know it's not cross site scripting
[13:02:36] <fusion27> because we're able to set up a script where we pass no args and it works fine
[13:02:38] <xec> the_jeebster: removed the contents of the change function and pasted into jsfiddle, seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/HbPe8/
[13:02:54] <fusion27> but when we pass args, we die
[13:03:00] <fusion27> Internale Server Error
[13:03:02] <xec> the_jeebster: fires whenever text field loses focus and has changed
[13:04:40] <the_jeebster> xec: strange, I'll do some digging
[13:05:10] <Norbo11> Any easy way to scale an image to fill it's parent, however maintain the aspect ratio (and therefore letterbox)?

[13:23:09] <gwouite> do you use the right version of jquery for the addon jquery.cycle.js ?
[13:24:24] <pedda> this i a cms extension, i will try to debug it on my own..
[13:24:49] <pedda> firebug tells me jquery.min.js causes this
[13:25:15] <pedda> i tried 1.7 and  1.8
[13:25:24] <pedda> i will try lower versions aditionally
[13:26:18] <gwouite> What about the jquery.cycle.js extension ? what is the version ? Is there any comment in the js file about the right jquery version to use ?
[13:26:36] <pedda> i can adjust the path to the cycle script
[13:26:56] <pedda> currently i#m trying the latest from github
[13:27:14] <gwouite> ok
[13:28:36] <pedda> hmm
[13:28:54] <gwouite> hmm ?
[13:29:07] <pedda> got the right combination of jquery and cycle version, but twitter bootstrap broke :-P
[13:29:24] <gwouite> :) side effect :)
[13:29:33] <pedda> yeah nice
[13:30:08] <gwouite> You can have two versions of jquery running ... Quite stupid but if you don't control everything it can be your issue ...
[13:30:40] <starsinmypockets> I have a fieldset - Author - that contains a bunch of disclosure information... Additional Author fieldsets can be loaded via ajax... I want my script to hide some of form elements within the Author fieldset, provide a button, then show the hidden elements when the button is clicked... Is it possible to accomplish this with a single script that targets the first fieldset (which , along with my script, is loaded with the page) 
[13:32:03] <pedda> gwouite: already checked that, the extension comes with 1.7.4 version of jquery
[13:32:48] <gwouite> which extension ? Twitter stuff or Cycle ?
[13:32:57] <pedda> cycle
[13:33:39] <gwouite> OK ... And about your twitter stuff, the problem is linked with jquery version ? Which one was running before 1.7.4 ?
[13:33:44] <pedda> i need a few minutes to figuer out
[13:33:46] <pedda> figure

[13:36:28] <gwouite> starsinmypockets: jquery website is full of examples to use the API ... It's great !
[13:37:39] <starsinmypockets> qwouite - I understand how to show and hide elements, I'm not sure how to target elements that aren't in the dom when my script is loaded (ie - elements loaded asynchronously after the script has run)
[13:38:59] <gwouite> when you load asynchronously elements, you can also make something like $(document).ready(function(){ alert('New elements ready to be targeted'); });
[13:39:15] <gwouite> i mean ... after loading them !
[13:39:17] <randomusername31> Quick question is there any function like serialize but for post requests not get?
[13:39:36] <gwouite> you can use serialize too ...
[13:39:57] <gwouite> randomusername31: you can use serialize too ... no ?
[13:40:39] <supsup> ? .serialize
[13:40:40] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[13:40:49] <randomusername31> serialize produces "a=1&b=2&c=3&d=4&e=5" so I'd have to decode with php
[13:41:08] <randomusername31> is there a quick way of doing that with php?
[13:41:16] <supsup> ? php
[13:41:17] <bot-t> You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[13:41:43] <gwouite> thank you bot-t ... Go back to bed please :)
[13:41:47] <supsup> i'd ask in php channel
[13:42:15] <gwouite> What do you want to do ? an ajax query, posted instead of getted ?
[13:42:38] <gwouite> you have to put datas in a field then say you want to post it ...
[13:43:13] <gwouite> the datas ... can be serialized... Then check the result you have in $_POST ... You'll have what you want ...
[13:43:41] <gwouite> I recommend you that you learn the difference between POST and GET in the details ...
[13:44:13] <gwouite> Learn how to construct an HTTP/1.1 Post request and all will be much more clear in your mind ;)
[13:44:34] <randomusername31> I didnt realise post still worked like a query string
[13:45:32] <Connorhd> it doesn't have to
[13:46:03] <gwouite> different way to POST datas ... but if you don't have too much datas to post, do it like that ;)
[13:48:30] <randomusername31> alright cool, serialize works fine, thanks
[13:48:42] <gwouite> cool, bye !
[13:48:45] <randomusername31> should probably just have tried it in the first place

[13:58:11] <diggitydane2> i would like to have an iFrame with a div in it, and in the main document have an input field.  When I type in the input, it would update the div in the iFrame.  Does anyone know of a good tutorial?
[13:58:32] <diggitydane2> similar to ad builder in google.  as you type, it shows an example of what it will look like on the side
[14:00:38] <gwouite> use the keypress bind for your input field and a settimeout that you cancel when a new key is pressed (to avoid reload of your iframe after each fast typed word)... Then you change the src attribute of your iframe to load the document which will show what you want to show...
[14:01:06] <gwouite> iframe is a way to do it ... But you can also have a simple dic that you fill with the result of an ajax query ...
[14:01:17] <gwouite> a simple "div" not "dic" ... :):)
[14:01:22] <diggitydane2> ha :)
[14:02:00] <diggitydane2> the iframe has the base HTML template in it, then the input will be CSS that the user wants to style it to
[14:02:09] <diggitydane2> so, i'd prefer to keep the iframe
[14:02:25] <gwouite> i understand ok :)
[14:02:52] <diggitydane2> is the javascript in the parent document?  like   iframe.dom_id.innerHTML = 'whatever'
[14:02:57] <diggitydane2> for each key press?
[14:03:10] <gwouite> so ... i produce a small example and send to you in few seconds ;)
[14:03:18] <diggitydane2> wow, awesome thanks
[14:06:39] <gwouite> Something like that ...
[14:06:43] <gwouite> var myTimeout = null;
[14:06:43] <gwouite> 			function change_src() {
[14:06:44] <gwouite> 				var _val = $("textarea[name=myCss]").val();
[14:06:44] <gwouite> 				$("#yourIframe").attr("src", "produce_my_new_iframe.php?val="+encodeURIComponent(_val));
[14:06:44] <gwouite> 			}
[14:06:45] <gwouite> 			$(document).ready(function() {
[14:06:45] <gwouite> 				
[14:06:45] <gwouite> 				$("textarea[name=myCss]").keypress(function (e) {
[14:06:46] <gwouite> 					if (myTimeout) clearTimeout(myTimeout);
[14:06:46] <gwouite> 					myTimeout = setTimeout("change_src()", 2000);
[14:06:46] <gwouite> 				});
[14:06:46] <gwouite> 			});
[14:07:16] <peterschmidler> Who can help me with this image slideshow? I want to fade back to the start image after hitting 'stop'. http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/hFHtJ
[14:07:48] <gwouite> it's maybe full of bug ... but you'll find a way to correct it ;)
[14:08:53] <diggitydane2> awesome thank you
[14:09:27] <gwouite> you're welcome, good night every body ! I need to sleep now ...

[14:16:44] <callumacrae> HAPPYFUNBRO: Why can't you use position: fixed
[14:18:47] <peterschmidler> gwouite: Thanks for the hint, but still no success....
[14:19:25] <HAPPYFUNBRO> callumacrae look at the bar on the following site after you scroll down: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/

[14:44:06] <sjeijk> help … http://jsfiddle.net/kkLDt/1/
[14:44:52] <sjeijk> quiet frustrating knowing that this should be really easy
[14:44:52] <Axsuul> HAPPYFUNBRO: height: 100%; position: fixed; right: 0; width: 200px

[14:46:09] <Eviltwin> HAPPYFUNBRO: I can promise you there's no jQuery in it :P

[15:00:24] <Eviltwin> tash1: I'm trying to give you a few pieces you can use
[15:00:34] <tash1> ah
[15:00:51] <Eviltwin> If you have year1, month1, day1 and year2, month2, day2 as numbers, do you know how to tell if one is before the other?
[15:01:11] <chovy> lol, i just looked at the wikie pedia page for Pastie
[15:01:13] <chovy> nws
[15:01:17] <azbyin> https://gist.github.com/3702433
[15:01:20] <tash1> in php I'd strtotime() but idk how to best accomplish this in js
[15:01:49] <Eviltwin> [2012, 9, 30] vs [2012, 10, 1]
[15:01:49] <azbyin> ok guys, there you have 2 files: static.html and dynamic.html. they are doing the exact same thing except the dom is built using js in the dynamic version
[15:01:54] <Eviltwin> Which one is earlier?
[15:01:57] <azbyin> they render differently in both chrome and ff!
[15:02:22] <tash1> I'd assume the first Eviltwin
[15:02:28] <Eviltwin> tash1: How do you know?
[15:02:30] <tash1> september is earlier than october
[15:02:32] <azbyin> i have no idea why they render differently. i had a look at the live htm tree in firebug for both and they look identical to me!
[15:02:46] <Eviltwin> [2012, 12, 31] vs [2013, 1, 1]
[15:02:49] <Eviltwin> Which one is earlier?
[15:02:59] <tash1> first, 2012 is earlier than 2013
[15:03:11] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:03:26] <Eviltwin> So if I give you [y1, m1, d1] and [y2, m2, d2]
[15:03:35] <Eviltwin> Hwo can you determine if the first one is before the second one?
[15:04:00] <tash1> in code, not entirely sure without bringing them to seconds
[15:04:07] <Eviltwin> ...
[15:04:17] <tash1> some kind of < logic
[15:04:23] <Eviltwin> What kind
[15:04:24] <azbyin> tash, compare each of the fields separately
[15:04:38] <sjeijk> http://jsfiddle.net/kkLDt/8/ is axsuul more what i need. Still acceptable code?
[15:05:08] <Axsuul> sjeijk: yea thats fine
[15:05:10] <tash1> if y1 is less than y2 check if m1 is less than m2 and so on
[15:05:11] <azbyin> by "separately" i don;t mean check if m1 < m2 then date1 is smaller. you need to compare each field remembering that there is a precedence
[15:05:14] <tash1> crap, gotta run :(
[15:05:19] <Axsuul> tash1: Date parsing.. have you looked into moment.js
[15:05:23] <tash1> not yet
[15:05:25] <sjeijk> great thanks
[15:05:25] <tash1> i will when I get back

[15:28:50] <monokrome> I can still do something like jQuery(document).on('dragstart', function () {})
[15:28:52] <monokrome> right?

[16:03:36] <monokrome> Seems like I can't do jQuery('#someelement').on('ondrop', function () { });
[16:06:35] <monokrome> Does jQuery assume that I didn't want the 'on' and remove it for me when I supply it maybe?
[16:24:20] <sjeijk> Is the div shocking also in firefox or chrome with? http://jsfiddle.net/kkLDt/15/ or can I do something about it?
[16:36:34] <rgr> if I have a record of containing rows where the index is a css property name and the value is the value for that css property, whats the best js construct to loop amd apply to an element?

[16:38:50] <odyniec> rgr: you don't need a loop, you can just pass that to the .css() method
[16:41:01] <rgr> hmm yeah. I must have some usual json/array/string error as its not working. debuger time.

[17:06:21] <rmurphey> coldhead: how goes your jquery learning?
[17:06:49] <coldhead> its a struggle, rmurphey. every day, of which this is the first, i struggle

[17:06:58] <coldhead> ah mike <3
[17:07:16] <rmurphey> someday it will get easier coldhead
[17:07:16] <tw2113> happy first day coldhead
[17:07:32] <rmurphey> someday every day won't be your first day
[17:07:37] <coldhead> tomorrow will be easier but man alive is that a long way away
[17:07:45] <coldhead> a: yes
[17:07:47] <abjorn> ohi
[17:07:55] <coldhead> thanks for the jqfundamentals update, rmurphey
[17:08:06] <coldhead> i never saw the old one but apparently it's much nicer now
[17:08:28] <coldhead> and well timed for the start of my adventures in learning
[17:08:49] <tw2113> coldhead, have you figured out how to solve "$ is not a function" yet?
[17:09:06] <abjorn> so one of my coworkers today tried to convince me we should switch from jquery to ext js. When I asked why he said cause it has widgets
[17:09:23] <abjorn> then i asked him what a closure is and he didnt know
[17:09:33] <abjorn> fun day
[17:09:40] <tw2113> so you won the debate abjorn ?
[17:10:04] <abjorn> well, im the one everyone defers to when it comes down to this shit, so yeah i had kind of already won from the start
[17:10:35] <rmurphey> there is a lot to be said for the approach ext takes
[17:10:42] <rmurphey> but there's a lot not to be said for its license :/
[17:11:05] <abjorn> there's also that
[17:11:33] <tw2113> in case anyone was curious, the candy corn oreos featured at Target right now, aren't worth insisting
[17:11:36] <abjorn> i have nothing in particular against ext, but when we have a shit ton of code, and worst of all, legacy code, that depends on jquery...switching to EXT because it has widgets is uh...inadvisable
[17:11:42] <tw2113> but if you pass by them, they won't be a waste of money either
[17:11:51] <phonebook_> widgets are always unsupported. you should avoid them like #politics or #css after a wild night of alcohol and blow
[17:11:55] <abjorn> candy corn oreos, WHAT
[17:12:00] <pouledodue> odyniec: thank you!
[17:12:19] <abjorn> but thats the only time i can tolerate politics, phonebook_
[17:12:40] <tw2113> abjorn, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/07/candy-corn-oreos_n_1865397.html
[17:12:51] <d4sh> hey, i'm trying to use the jqueryui resizeable plugin, but i need to do something like .destroy() it because i ahve other manipulations to do to it
[17:13:05] <d4sh> is there any way to do that?
[17:13:21] <abjorn> .resizable("destroy");
[17:13:43] <abjorn> should be able to do that with any jquery ui widget
[17:13:46] <abjorn> widgetythingy
[17:13:51] <abjorn> god i hate the word widget
[17:13:57] <d4sh> how do you call it?
[17:14:17] <abjorn> call it on the elem you originally called .resizable() on
[17:14:21] <d4sh> so i have somejqueryobject.resizeable({initalconditions}); and then
[17:14:32] <abjorn> so call it on somejqueryobject
[17:14:33] <d4sh> well i dont want to destroy the element itself
[17:14:39] <d4sh> its an image
[17:14:42] <d4sh> and its for editing the iamge
[17:14:46] <abjorn> it won't destroy it
[17:14:46] <d4sh> one of the tooltops is resize
[17:15:06] <d4sh> so i have $('img').resizeable();
[17:15:07] <abjorn> it just returns it to the state it was in before you originally called resizeable
[17:15:23] <d4sh> and i just call $('img').destroy(); ??
[17:15:27] <abjorn> no
[17:15:36] <abjorn> $("img").resizable("destroy");
[17:15:37] <phonebook_> i develop all of my widgets with jquery bridge and i call mine widgey-bridgies... and i make amazing code but i purposely hard code strings so even the most serious companies must call my widgets widgey-bridges
[17:15:39] <d4sh> ohhhhh
[17:15:40] <d4sh> cool
[17:15:43] <d4sh> let me try that
[17:15:45] <abjorn> werd
[17:16:13] <phonebook_> thats how i stick it to the man
[17:16:19] <abjorn> see, if I was going to do that, phonebook_, id call them watgitz
[17:16:46] <tw2113> just call them doohickies and it all makes sense
[17:17:03] <abjorn> or we could just call them "ui components"
[17:17:20] <tw2113> stop making sense
[17:17:25] <abjorn> :(
[17:17:51] <abjorn> wher mah coldheads at
[17:17:58] <tw2113> you'll confuse the rookies
[17:18:17] <ibodi> will this password method more secure, or just worse because it add more complex only:
[17:18:20] <ibodi> login.form.password > md5(pwd) > enc (pwd,server-random-salt, ip, session_id) > server validate password
[17:18:38] <abjorn> >password
[17:18:39] <abjorn> >md5
[17:18:39] <abjorn> >2012
[17:18:39] <abjorn> ishygddt
[17:20:18] <abjorn> sowait, you're storing your password hash as md5(password) + salt + ip + session_id?
[17:21:05] <coldhead> she said i know what it is to be dead
[17:21:39] <abjorn> are we spouting lyrics now?
[17:21:41] <abjorn> is that what time it is?
[17:22:16] <ibodi> abjorn: onclick the "Login" button on the page: jquery start to: md5(pwd)
[17:22:53] <ibodi> abjorn: then encrypt(md5(pwd), time(), random-salt(), ip(), .. etc) and send back to server
[17:23:08] <ibodi> abjorn: server decrypt and validate password.
[17:23:25] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[17:23:44] <abjorn> why not just...use https and send the password over for the server to then hash and check against the db?
[17:24:09] <abjorn> https encryption is likely to be better than whatever encryption function you're using in JS
[17:24:16] <ibodi> abjorn: im talking about non-https alternative
[17:24:36] <abjorn> psh, not using SSL encryption for user auth? What is this, 2009?
[17:24:53] <abjorn> idk, you can do that if you want
[17:25:06] <abjorn> i dont see the point in including ip, time, or any of that there
[17:25:14] <abjorn> anything like that should be handled on the server end
[17:25:27] <abjorn> just encrypt the password and send it over and let the server figure it out
[17:25:40] <abjorn> not that your encryption will make much of a difference but *shrug*
[17:25:50] <ibodi> abjorn: use time() rand() ip() -- only to make a randomed decodable hash.
[17:26:21] <abjorn> if you can guarantee that you're gonna have the same values available on the server then whatevs
[17:26:55] <abjorn> honestly, this isn't really the chan for this, but *shrug*
[17:27:43] <abjorn> btw
[17:27:44] <abjorn> md5 sucks
[17:27:47] <abjorn> jus sayin
[17:28:03] <ibodi> yes. md5() nowadays === plain text
[17:28:25] <abjorn> not quite so much, but it's super easy to generate collisions
[17:28:32] <ibodi> however still better than plain text. as you can easily remember a plain texted pwd
[17:28:35] <abjorn> aes-256 is where it's at
[17:28:39] <ibodi> but not 32-char md5
[17:29:20] <abjorn> this is why no one should use crap like wordpress, all them mofos still use md5, because there's lazy and mysql has an md5 function
[17:29:26] <abjorn> *they're
[17:30:27] <abjorn> did support for a major hosting company for about 7 months, hilarious how much of our compromised sites are wordpress
[17:31:23] <ibodi> was wp originally started by usa kid ?
[17:31:55] <ibodi> the EU kids are usually smarter.
[17:31:57] <phonebook_> ive never used wordpress and that makes me feel stupid. is that ironic?
[17:32:23] <ibodi> yes. better stay away from anything "will make you more stupid" :D
[17:32:41] <abjorn> in some ways wordpress is great, in just as many ways it's bad
[17:32:41] <ibodi> however sometimes better to be stupid
[17:33:07] <abjorn>  and nationality never has anything to do with anything, sir :p
[17:33:07] <ibodi> so there is no pros or cons
[17:33:13] <abjorn> rofl
[17:33:14] <abjorn> basically
[17:33:23] <tw2113> there are pros and cons for everything
[17:33:46] <ibodi> i met many usa guys, they only know that usa on the earth. nothing else.
[17:34:15] <ibodi> made me worried about oz. as oz also a big country on the planet though ?
[17:34:20] <abjorn> probably better not to initiate INCOMING SHITSTORM topics like that
[17:34:40] <ibodi> well. let 's focus on jq topic here.
[17:34:48] <abjorn> hey now i didnt say THAT
[17:59:57] <phonebook_> im trying to get the w3c to support localStorage(key, callback); if anyone is on board
[18:01:13] <ravster> Can I use .remove() to save an element in the dom and then put it in another place?
[18:01:25] <ravster> s/in/from
[18:03:55] <phonebook_> yes
[18:04:06] <phonebook_> var x = n.remove()l
[18:04:13] <phonebook_> y,append(x);
[18:04:39] <phonebook_> will work, though you may lose some event handling or jquery handled data
[18:04:47] <ravster> phonebook_: cool. thanks.
[18:08:21] <phonebook_> message has been submitted
[18:08:50] <phonebook_> when you are all doing localSorage(key, callback) instead of fucking with idb thank ME
[18:32:44] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I am having a problem with a column floating away when a page is zoomed. For example, if you go to the following page, scroll down 800+ px, and then zoom, the right column will float away. What can I do to solve this? http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ relevant code: http://pastebin.com/ur8YxY0F
[18:47:27] <termite> HAPPYFUNBRO: I  that is a tough one.  I disable javascript and see if you get the issue
[18:47:37] <termite> then you know if it's code or display
[18:48:41] <termite> var leftValue = (window.pageXOffset - 45) + 'px';
[18:48:48] <termite> looks like a possible offender
[18:56:03] <HAPPYFUNBRO> termite it is
[18:56:12] <HAPPYFUNBRO> the problem is with the zoom offset
[18:57:48] <termite> you could use the offset of an element that isn't effected and use it as the base for your left value
[18:58:27] <termite> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[20:21:49] <Thorn> hello
[20:23:15] <Thorn> my $.get().error(callback) is never called, I tried creating a "connection refused" and 502 errors

[20:43:49] <mdelcx_> coldhead: keeping tabs on me, huh
[20:44:58] <coldhead> just wondering what that project was :)
[20:45:03] <coldhead> then i found out
[20:45:08] <coldhead> then i got terribly bored
[20:45:10] <coldhead> go in peace
[20:46:29] <mdelcx_> I'll try
[20:49:49] <slick-> hello
[20:49:55] <slick-> im trying to fade in a div using this code:
[20:49:56] <slick-> jQuery(".station").css({"top": e.offsetY + "px","left": e.offsetX + "px"}).fadeIn(75).draggable();
[20:50:01] <slick-> but when i keep the mouse down
[20:50:04] <slick-> the offset moves away
[20:50:06] <slick-> any idea why?
[20:56:44] <coldhead> something to do with draggable probably, slick-
[20:56:56] <slick-> :(
[20:56:59] <coldhead> i would check the UI docs for another way to set the positioning
[20:57:04] <coldhead> using draggable()
[20:57:08] <coldhead> rather than fighting it
[20:57:18] <slick-> ok
[20:57:35] <slick-> thx
[20:57:39] <slick-> appreciate hte help
[20:57:46] <slick-> dont wanna disappoint the boss tomorrow
[20:57:52] <coldhead> good luck!
[21:02:51] <coldhead> AND YOUR BIRD IS GREEN
[21:04:13] <shoky> but you cant see me
[21:04:28] <coldhead> i can't see... YEEEEE
[21:04:46] <shoky> YE
[21:21:14] <tw2113> eww it's the n00b
[21:23:08] <shoky> hueaheuaheuaehuaheuae
[21:24:14] <Eviltwin> Is shoky the n00b?
[21:24:37] <shoky> i won't be offended
[21:24:52] <shoky> hard as you may try
[21:25:01] <Eviltwin> Maybe it's coldhead
[21:25:07] <Eviltwin> I heard it's his first day using jQuery
[21:25:20] <coldhead> i doubt i've been here long enough to have formed that reputation yet
[21:25:21] <shoky> n00b gal0re
[21:25:46] <tw2113> n00bsauce
[21:29:05] <abjorn> who's a coldhead
[21:29:12] <abjorn> headcold?
[21:29:21] <tw2113> i has one
[21:31:18] <coldhead> i am so sorry
[21:31:29] <coldhead> i never suffer from headcolds
[21:31:45] <coldhead> i only suffer from every single other blight and curse and malady
[21:33:51] <abjorn> ironyhead
[21:44:47] <ibodi> is there any js data sent from server to client, only server and client know, and no other middle men ?
[21:45:37] <shoky> coldhead this is for you
[21:46:50] <ibodi> i think it is impossible, but i still ask.
[21:47:12] <shoky> https plz?
[21:47:29] <ibodi> what if there is no https ?
[21:47:53] <shoky> then fear the middlemen
[21:47:59] <bmoyles0117> lol +1
[21:48:58] <ibodi> ASE encrypt, send out public key only to client, and use private key to decode, that's actually a smart idea.
[21:49:14] <ibodi> as private key never transfer on the net
[21:49:38] <mdelcx_>   ill say this - if you are worried about middlemen seeing your js for a reason other than that they might modify it, then you have a bigger problem
[21:50:29] <mdelcx_> for example, if you are storing credentials or something wacky like that in your sauce
[21:51:52] <coldhead> i don't even pretend like security is possible outside of VPNs
[21:51:56] <coldhead> the web is open
[21:52:20] <mdelcx_> assuming you control the VPN and it's connections :)
[21:53:18] <coldhead> well the nice thing about a VPN is you can make it someone else's problem
[21:53:27] <coldhead> "oh well we need to get a contractor to set up the VPN and admin it for us"
[21:53:34] <coldhead> and they take all the blame
[21:53:46] <coldhead> meanwhile, on a grassy knoll somewhere in Texas
[21:53:46] <ibodi> that's move privacy from one pot to another
[21:53:55] <mdelcx_> yes, im a skilled buck-passer myself
[21:54:05] <coldhead> its a vital skill in this age
[21:54:46] <mdelcx_> i pass more bucks than a rapper at a strip club
[21:54:56] <coldhead> heyo
[21:55:03] <mdelcx_> <= this guy
[21:55:24] * mdelcx_ 's got jokes
[22:11:27] <coldhead> another girl another name
[22:13:44] <ibodi> client.form[fieldA,fieldB].submit > client only send fieldA to server > server feedback something > client then send whole form to server, is this possible ?
[22:14:23] <mdelcx_> why would fieldB be sent at all?
[22:14:24] <Cork> ibodi: your using ajax?
[22:14:27] <mdelcx_> the first time
[22:14:32] <ibodi> well. it is possible. simply put fieldB outside form then.
[22:14:51] <mdelcx_> um ?
[22:14:55] <Cork> or first submit through ajax, and send what you want
[22:15:07] <Cork> and then do a full form submission
[22:15:27] <ibodi> Cork: yeah. cool. now solved my problem. thanks.
[22:15:31] <mdelcx_> you can use $.ajax the first pass, no need to bother with the form
[22:15:31] <coldhead> Cork++, do what he says ibodi :)
[22:15:51] <ibodi> coldhead: cool!
[22:33:28] <coldhead> LISTEN TO THIS DUDE, RUFUS. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT

[23:31:43] <ruby_on_tails> you see http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/textarea-expander/index.html, if you type new lines in the second textarea here, the textarea expands, but with a glitch, the scroller appears first(though its hidden), and then the code removes it. how can i remove that glitch ?
[23:32:47] <runvnc> use css to keep the scrollbar hidden all the time?
[23:32:53] <runvnc> overflow: hidden
[23:34:42] <ruby_on_tails> runvnc: thats already there, try typing, the text moves up and then it moves down, there is a glitch
[23:35:34] <ruby_on_tails> as soon as the user goes on to a new line, the height of the textarea still remains old, so the first line moves up, then the js acts and expands the textarea, so the first line moves down, it feels buggy
[23:51:40] <sjeijk> Is the div shocking also in firefox or chrome with? http://jsfiddle.net/kkLDt/15/ or can I do something about it?
[23:52:54] <tw2113> shocking?
[23:53:04] <coldhead> shoky: one for you perhaps?
[23:53:46] <sjeijk> yes in safari for mac the popup div gets distorted sometimes when i move my mouse
[23:53:58] <tw2113> didn't notice anything like that myself
[23:54:39] <coldhead> no one uses safari
[23:54:41] <coldhead> or mac
[23:54:43] <coldhead> don't worry
[23:54:45] <sjeijk> :)
[23:54:56] <sjeijk> in chrome i don't have the problem indeed
[23:55:28] <sjeijk> which is typical cuz it uses the same web engine
[23:55:39] <coldhead> alert('This site works best in Chrome')
