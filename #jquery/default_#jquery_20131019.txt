[00:07:04] <ripthejacker> is there a jquery or js equivalent of python String.format()?
[00:07:23] <LoneSoldier728> what does string.format() do exactly
[00:07:25] <LoneSoldier728> do you mean
[00:07:28] <LoneSoldier728> toString()
[00:07:28] <LoneSoldier728> ?
[00:07:32] <LoneSoldier728> to turn it into a string
[00:07:45] <ripthejacker> like '{0} {1}'.format('hello','world') outputs 'hello world'
[00:07:56] <ripthejacker> it's like printf
[00:08:08] <LoneSoldier728> there is no real print Line
[00:08:10] <ripthejacker> in c , but it builds a string and not just for printing
[00:08:12] <LoneSoldier728> you can either
[00:08:24] <LoneSoldier728> so
[00:08:33] <LoneSoldier728> you want to output two objects together
[00:08:41] <LoneSoldier728> show me an example
[00:08:43] <ripthejacker> yes format
[00:08:45] <ripthejacker> ok
[00:08:46] <LoneSoldier728> of something and what you are trying to do
[00:08:47] <LoneSoldier728> because
[00:08:56] <LoneSoldier728> you can concat()
[00:09:04] <LoneSoldier728> there is a bunch of ways but depends what you are trying to do
[00:09:33] <_rgn> ripthejacker: there's a library for that kind of stuff
[00:09:45] <_rgn> but can't do that with native js or jquery
[00:09:51] <ripthejacker> I want to wrap a text with html
[00:10:22] <LoneSoldier728> '<p></p>'
[00:10:23] <LoneSoldier728> like that?
[00:10:25] <ripthejacker> like if I pass 'hi' and 'em', then it will return '<em>hi</em>'
[00:10:30] <ripthejacker> LoneSoldier728: yes like that
[00:10:57] <LoneSoldier728> so with javascript are you just trying to add " " around it
[00:11:04] <LoneSoldier728> around a statement or?
[00:11:18] <LoneSoldier728> it still is so vague to me
[00:11:30] <ripthejacker> the fucntion will work like this
[00:11:33] <hExDJ> alert('<em>'+some_var+'</em');
[00:11:52] <ripthejacker> wrap('hi','p') gives '<p>hi</p>'
[00:11:57] <hExDJ> if the variable already contains "hi", that's a string
[00:12:24] <ripthejacker> hExDJ: yes both are strings, and the function returns a string
[00:12:40] <LoneSoldier728> ok so yeah u can alert it
[00:12:44] <hExDJ> so you don't need to convert to string
[00:12:45] <LoneSoldier728> or just in another function return it
[00:12:50] <_rgn> > _.template('<<%= tag %>><%= str %></<%= tag %>>')({ tag: 'em', str: 'test' });
[00:12:50] <_rgn> '<em>test</em>'
[00:13:14] <ripthejacker> _rgn:  so I need to use underscore?
[00:13:34] <_rgn> probably not the best idea if you're not using it already
[00:13:40] <LoneSoldier728> ya wasteful
[00:13:46] <ripthejacker> _rgn: I'm not using it
[00:13:48] <LoneSoldier728> if you actually show code that you are
[00:13:55] <LoneSoldier728> trying to work with we can help u otherwise
[00:14:00] <LoneSoldier728> it is hard to tell
[00:14:05] <LoneSoldier728> what u are trying to do exactly
[00:14:17] <LoneSoldier728> from what I understand u want it to be generic enough
[00:14:23] <LoneSoldier728> where u can choose the tag and the
[00:14:25] <LoneSoldier728> text
[00:14:29] <ripthejacker> wrap('hi','p') gives '<p>hi</p>'
[00:14:31] <LoneSoldier728> and for it to build a string based on that
[00:14:35] <ripthejacker> just one level of nesting
[00:14:50] <ripthejacker> like I can do
[00:14:51] <LoneSoldier728> i understand that but is hi and p always going to be hi and p
[00:14:57] <LoneSoldier728> or do you want to say something like
[00:15:10] <LoneSoldier728> var x = '<'
[00:15:14] <ripthejacker> LoneSoldier728: no
[00:15:16] <LoneSoldier728> var b = function()
[00:15:24] <ripthejacker> I can give string
[00:15:29] <ripthejacker> and any tag
[00:15:50] <LoneSoldier728> ya in javascript it isnt going to be as easy as
[00:15:58] <LoneSoldier728> wrap('hi', 'p')
[00:16:27] <LoneSoldier728> you either have to write a function that builds the string up and allow it to take variables or parameters
[00:16:34] <LoneSoldier728> for the tag and the text
[00:16:54] <LoneSoldier728> best bet is
[00:17:06] <ripthejacker> I can do fun wrap (text, tag) { return '<' + tag + '>' +text + '</' + tag  + '>'}
[00:17:42] <LoneSoldier728> function wrapTag(text, tag, cb) { code of building it  cb(result) }
[00:17:52] <LoneSoldier728> or just returning the result
[00:18:02] <LoneSoldier728> if you want to set the function to a variable
[00:18:38] <_rgn> var elem = $('<' + tag + '>').text(str); elem.prop('outerHTML')
[00:20:49] <ripthejacker> _rgn: yes that will do, but I was looking for a function similar to printf
[00:20:58] <ripthejacker> { return '<' + tag + '>' +text + '</' + tag  + '>'}
[00:20:58] <_rgn> my first answer
[00:21:21] <_rgn> 10:09:36 <_rgn> ripthejacker: there's a library for that kind of stuff
[00:21:41] <LoneSoldier728> ripthejacker if you u are trying to do that, why dont u just write a function?
[00:22:05] <ripthejacker> LoneSoldier728, ok
[00:22:17] <LoneSoldier728> var tag = createTag(tag, text);
[00:23:19] <ripthejacker> { return '<' + tag + '>' +text + '</' + tag  + '>'} , this I can do in python as '<{0}>{1}</{0}>'.format(tag,text)
[00:23:53] <ripthejacker> but I'll use _rgn's solution , it is useful
[00:24:07] <ripthejacker> thanks _rgn, LoneSoldier728
[00:24:08] <ripthejacker> :)
[00:24:18] <LoneSoldier728> and that will call createTag(tag, text) { var x,y,z, piece; var x='<'; var y = '>'; var z = '/>'; var piece = x + tag + y + text +x + tag + z; return piece}
[00:24:31] <_rgn> lol ^
[00:25:01] <ripthejacker> :P
[00:25:13] <ripthejacker> yeah that's very elegant
[00:26:58] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/kGXaM/
[00:27:00] <LoneSoldier728> there u go
[00:27:03] <LoneSoldier728> and it is function
[00:27:05] <LoneSoldier728> functional
[00:27:42] <_rgn> don't write that kind of code in a job interview hehe
[00:30:27] <Zarthus> just so you know
[00:30:33] <Zarthus> that prints "<p>hi<p/>"
[00:30:40] <LoneSoldier728> why cuz of all the variables
[00:31:04] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsperf.com/test-variables1w2
[00:31:08] <Zarthus> and yeah the variables are rather unnessecary and make it cloggy if anything if you ask me :P
[00:32:03] <LoneSoldier728> i was thinking it might run faster
[00:32:28] <_rgn> performance is hardly ever an issue
[00:34:09] <LoneSoldier728> oh oops messed up the tag
[00:36:29] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsperf.com/test-variables21331
[00:36:36] <LoneSoldier728> well i guess version 3 is truly the best
[00:38:18] <ripthejacker> LoneSoldier728: what if I want to add a class :P
[00:38:46] <LoneSoldier728> like class name?
[00:39:01] <LoneSoldier728> '<p class="blah">
[00:39:02] <ripthejacker> yes
[00:39:08] <LoneSoldier728> can u throw it in the parameter?
[00:39:13] <LoneSoldier728> or do u want it to be separate too
[00:40:10] <sahbeewah> that is the worst
[00:41:01] <sahbeewah> why are you doing that
[00:41:51] <LoneSoldier728> what is?
[00:42:22] <sahbeewah> writing that function, what's the point
[00:42:36] <LoneSoldier728> he wants to be able to create tags im assuming for a system
[00:42:50] <LoneSoldier728> based on different inputs
[00:42:56] <LoneSoldier728> it should create a tag with the inputs
[00:43:21] <LoneSoldier728> im assuming otherwise he can just write it as a string himself...
[00:44:32] <ripthejacker> sahbeewah: I want to use map on an array of strings
[00:45:01] * _rgn grabs the popcorn
[00:45:17] <sahbeewah> sure
[00:50:25] <sahbeewah> you want to use map on an array of strings, so you decided to write a function which concatenates strings?
[00:51:35] <ripthejacker> no, I want to convert the array of string to array of html elements , where html em is string wrapped by a tag
[00:53:10] <sahbeewah> why don't you just create the element instead of creating a string
[00:54:43] <ripthejacker> because the string comes from http resp and need to use it elsewhere
[00:56:13] <sarvsav> hello everyone, need some help with jQuery
[00:56:47] <sarvsav> i need to run jQuery, when a particular div get loaded on the page.
[00:56:52] <sarvsav> how to achieve that?
[00:57:02] <LoneSoldier728> select it by the id
[00:57:10] <LoneSoldier728> and document.ready?
[00:57:38] <bigbugjava> $.('whatever').on('action',func)
[01:01:18] <sarvsav> Thanks, let me try
[01:02:19] <LoneSoldier728> it wont be able to select it if it does not see it on the page... but u should not have ur script ran
[01:02:27] <LoneSoldier728> until the end of it
[01:02:28] <sarvsav> Well,
[01:02:29] <LoneSoldier728> or
[01:02:38] <LoneSoldier728> u can add a function to the actual
[01:02:39] <sarvsav> i am working on this page
[01:02:40] <sarvsav> http://photografrica.com/portfolio/africa-fish/#!prettyPhoto[pp_gal]/0/
[01:02:41] <LoneSoldier728> element
[01:02:54] <LoneSoldier728> ok what u tring to do
[01:03:02] <sarvsav> and when someone click on image, a new div created
[01:03:23] <sarvsav> i want to change the hyperlink in that new div
[01:04:18] <sarvsav> I tried this, but its not working, http://jsfiddle.net/uvvEL/
[01:04:20] <LoneSoldier728> onclick
[01:04:32] <LoneSoldier728> append('div'
[01:04:47] <LoneSoldier728> do u want it onclick
[01:04:49] <LoneSoldier728> or onload?
[01:05:11] <sarvsav> Well, let me explain the whole scenario.
[01:06:16] <sarvsav> there is a hyperlink on name of all the images in gallery, and when someone click on name of any image, in the subject part of hyperlink, the image name will get append
[01:06:22] <sarvsav> and i am not able to do that
[01:07:48] <sarvsav> its okay, if i am able to do it on hover, click or whatever. I need to append the image name at the end, like mailto:: ?subject=query <image-name>
[01:09:48] <LoneSoldier728> sorry working on something right now... but look into the jquery
[01:09:50] <LoneSoldier728> commands
[01:09:55] <LoneSoldier728> one of them should do it for u
[01:10:12] <sarvsav> okay, thanks.
[01:51:28] <neworder> Hi guys
[01:51:35] <neworder> I'm using json_encode PHP function
[01:51:50] <neworder> and echoing the result like this
[01:52:03] <neworder> <?php echo "var delv = $js_array;"; ?>
[01:52:19] <neworder> In this case, do I need to use json.parse
[01:52:53] <neworder> Do I need to do this? var parsedarray = $.parseJSON(delv);
[01:54:28] <codechewing> neworder: yes, you'll need to echo it with php and then parse it
[01:55:17] <neworder> codechewing: Hmm, when I tired this console.log(delv[0]); without parsing, it works
[01:55:22] <neworder> any idea why?
[01:55:39] <neworder> How come I'm able to access the json data without parsing
[01:56:03] <codechewing> did you already parse it into json using php?
[01:56:58] <neworder> I did this, $js_array=json_encode($fees);
[01:57:15] <neworder> does it mean I already parsed it
[01:57:17] <neworder> haha
[01:57:34] <codechewing> yeah, so it's already been parse withg the php :)
[01:57:52] <neworder> hmm, I see, thanks!
[01:58:03] <neworder> so if I want to loop through my json array
[01:58:36] <neworder> can I use .each(delv){   };
[01:58:43] <neworder> like that
[01:59:40] <codechewing> you can do for(i in delv) { console.log(delv[i]); }
[02:01:39] <codechewing> neworder: does that make sense?
[02:01:59] <neworder> codechewing: thanks! yup! =)
[02:02:32] <codechewing> good good, you're welcome
[02:02:49] <neworder> It should work in IE also right?
[02:02:55] <codechewing> yes
[02:03:01] <neworder> I read somewhere that IE might have problems with json parsing
[02:03:08] <neworder> hmm ok
[02:03:39] <codechewing> only if you're using parseJSON in <= IE7
[02:04:07] <codechewing> but you're not parsing the json with javascript - you're doing it with PHP
[02:04:25] <neworder> Ah I see!
[02:05:31] <neworder> I was doing an jQUery AJAX call that day and I did this json_encode($array) in PHP
[02:05:47] <neworder> Do I need to use json Parse in this case?
[02:06:14] <neworder>  success: function(result) {          	var jsonData = $.parseJSON(result);
[02:08:39] <codechewing> neworder: i wouldn't have thought so, as it's already in json format from the PHP doing json_encode
[02:08:59] <neworder> hmm
[02:09:14] <neworder> I see
[02:09:53] <neworder> Why do we have json Parse then? Since we already have json_encode in PHP
[02:09:55] <neworder> haha
[02:11:40] <codechewing> not everyone is working with php of course ;p
[02:12:03] <codechewing> and sometimes you'll need to make sure it's in json format
[02:17:21] <neworder> Hmm I see
[02:17:31] <neworder> I tried this
[02:17:46] <neworder> console.log(typeof(result))
[02:17:50] <neworder> of an AJAX call
[02:18:11] <neworder> and surprisingly, it shows "string" in the console
[02:18:19] <neworder> instead of "objec"
[02:18:22] <neworder> object*
[02:19:51] <codechewing> but...if you're ultimately going to be working with the JSON in javascript, you should always be safe and parse the json with javascript (even if it's already been parsed with php), as it will eliminate any special characters that javascript may not be able to handle from causing errors
[02:20:28] <codechewing> yeah - the typeof will == string because the json output is probably wrapped in quotes
[02:21:09] <codechewing> it has probably returned something like this; "{key: value, key2: value2}"
[02:23:16] <neworder> Ah I see
[02:23:43] <neworder> the typeof returned an object for the previous example
[02:23:49] <neworder> "object"
[02:24:14] <neworder> console.log(typeof(delv))
[02:24:21] <neworder> returns "object"
[02:24:25] <codechewing> okay - so there are probably no surrounding quotes that time
[02:24:39] <neworder> hmm
[02:24:46] <neworder> I see
[02:24:56] <codechewing> so it's a literal object
[02:50:45] <lordmunka> Heya guys
[02:52:06] <lordmunka> I'd like to set up an animated background for my Joomla 3.1.5 site (http://www.127th.org). Something like what this guys have on the header http://starcitizenbase.com/
[02:52:50] <lordmunka> This is my first time doing a website, or using JQuery, so I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with the scripts I find on the website
[02:54:58] <lordmunka> Is there anyone that can help me, please?
[02:59:59] <lordmunka> Hello? Please
[03:04:08] <lordmunka> I beg you. Someone, please
[03:04:13] <lordmunka> :(
[03:25:00] <shoky> wat
[03:33:23] <kilian123> is onresize performant?
[03:33:37] <kilian123> window onresize
[03:33:47] <kilian123> to check heights of divs in the document
[03:33:51] <kilian123> (and set them)
[03:35:01] <shoky> much more performant to rely on css and let the browser do it for you
[03:35:50] <kilian123> yes, i know, but its difficult to set the heights of some divs in a .wrap using css...
[03:35:51] <shoky> but.. sometimes it can be neccessary, in which case - it depends what you do exactly on resize, and how long that takes.
[03:35:54] <kilian123> (on a clean way)
[03:36:18] <shoky> difficult or not, it's the better approach usually
[03:36:21] <kilian123> look that this: the boxes get the same heights using jquery
[03:36:23] <kilian123> http://www.vegpool.de/intern/rsp.html?style=responsive
[03:36:32] <kilian123> yes, i know.
[03:50:32] <kilian123> anybody want to look?
[03:56:06] <ravenzz> sounds like an odd proposal
[04:26:16] <grafi> boop
[04:35:32] <peter1a> hello
[04:40:41] <peter1a> i have this code http://pastebin.com/cLbEPPwB, what i would like that i can show hide elemenst in differend <ul tags which are definded by id, how can i do that?
[04:52:44] <kilian123> why is $(window).width not the same width that is used in css breakpoints?
[04:53:36] <kilian123> i set a class depending on the windows width... but its different from the width that the browser uses with the css media query
[04:53:53] <kilian123> i read, that browsers calculatetheir widths differently
[04:54:09] <kilian123> but why not also on media queries?
[04:56:07] <peter1a> anyone*
[04:56:09] <peter1a> i have this code http://pastebin.com/cLbEPPwB, what i would like that i can show hide elemenst in differend <ul tags which are definded by id, how can i do that?
[05:08:19] <ph88> peter1a:  use jsfiddle.net
[05:08:28] <peter1a> how?
[05:08:59] <ph88> use your browser
[05:09:11] <ph88> enter adress and hit enter key on keyboard
[05:10:48] <peter1a> okey
[05:10:49] <peter1a> http://jsfiddle.net/Ey7M6/
[05:10:51] <peter1a> here it is
[05:11:15] <peter1a> soo i would like that it works in all <ul> tags where id is diifferent
[05:11:29] <peter1a> i need to implent id as key
[05:12:58] <peter1a> any ideas how to?
[05:14:57] <dabear> peter1a: select all ULs, filter out those without ids or where the same id is seen earlier in the document. then construct a clickable LI for each ul and append
[05:15:33] <peter1a> w00t?
[05:15:52] <peter1a> sorry i am new in jquery like from yesterday and really dont have any ideas yet
[05:16:07] <dabear> that's fine
[05:16:19] <dabear> simplify your question and your code
[05:16:41] <dabear> make it work before adding complexity
[05:17:09] <peter1a> dabear do you understand what i want too do with my code?
[05:17:18] <dabear> not quite
[05:17:34] <peter1a> i have <ul tags> but more than one
[05:17:55] <dabear> yep
[05:17:59] <peter1a> heere i have add two, which have unique id first have id 1,second id 2
[05:18:06] <dabear> ok
[05:18:42] <peter1a> now i need to make my code works when i click in first ul with id 1 it needs to show all elemnts which are childs of this id

[06:13:11] <Armistice> Any ideas how I can do what I want?
[06:19:23] <ph88> Armistice: at the time you are looking for .foo there is no such element on your page
[06:19:31] <blewp> i think the problem is, when you do: var $foo = $(".foo"); you find all the dom elements with the class .foo at the current moment
[06:19:42] <blewp> what he said*
[06:19:45] <Armistice> I am aware of this ph88, is there a way I can sort of do a delegate or something?
[06:20:43] <ph88> you can look for .foo inside a function and then later call this function
[06:21:34] <Armistice> Hmm... removes the need for a variable there but I think I can manage with that.
[06:22:32] <Armistice> It wouldn't really get used much anyway.
[06:22:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Firebug gives warnings about the official jquery library. Can anything be done about this?
[06:23:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Error in parsing value for 'background'. Declaration dropped.
[06:23:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 	
[06:23:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0%, #fafa...
[06:23:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 	
[06:23:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jquery.min.js (line 4, col 16)
[06:23:31] <Armistice> You may be better off surrounding that in quotes. background: "-webkit-gradient....." maybe?
[06:24:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> But it's the official jquery.min.js :(
[06:24:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> don't want to edit that
[06:24:43] <Armistice> Oh... i thought you were assigning that background in your app. What are you doing to trigger that error or does it just happen on it's own?
[06:25:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it happens on its own, just by loading the library... but it only shows when I enable "show javascript warnings" - but client wants it gone :-|
[06:27:50] <Armistice> Well, it's a webkit property and firefox is not webkit. That's probably the main cause of it. If you tried it out in chrome it would probably be fine however I'm not sure what I'd do to solve the issue though. One of the jquery devs may be able to help you... if any are active :P
[06:28:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok, but I get other warnings too, like: Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated. Use defaultPrevented instead.
[06:28:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and that's in the official jquery.js
[06:28:42] <Armistice> What version?
[06:28:53] <Armistice> (of jQuery that is)
[06:29:03] <ph88> latest
[06:29:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 1.9.1
[06:29:08] <ph88> cuz i have those warnings too
[06:29:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and I already tried with 1.10, same thing
[06:29:12] <ph88> on 2.* branch
[06:29:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't really mind them, but the client things I made errors
[06:29:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> thinks*
[06:29:48] <ph88> lol
[06:30:23] <ph88> act like you are a fucking export and inform your client :)
[06:32:09] <Armistice> Submit it as a bug but may not be fixed for a while. The first one I would assume is jQuery not checking if the browser is webkit or not. The second is ... pretty obvious, just a deprecated method but defaultPrevented is standard these days (unless you're using an old browser then it may not work).
[06:32:43] <Armistice> Otherwise, just do what ph88 said unless you're willing to modify the crap out of jQuery (I would advise not unless you knew what you were doing)
[06:33:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> alright
[06:33:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jqueryui has also problems in the css
[06:33:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Error in parsing value for 'filter'. Declaration dropped.
[06:34:27] <ph88> http://vimeo.com/68470326  <-- skip ahead to 30:00  part about clients
[06:34:43] <Armistice> filter I think is for IE8 and earlier, ecky--ptang-zoob so... that's that issue. :P
[06:35:13] <Armistice> Seems like a possible interesting video ph88 :)
[06:35:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I like that bearded guy, he's right!
[06:36:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I AM THE GATEKEEPER!
[06:36:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> he's so dry :DDD
[06:37:10] <ph88> LOL
[06:37:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> He talks about designing as getting raped
[06:38:33] <Armistice> That'd be just his beard talking. ;)
[06:44:01] <sl33k_> I am iterating over a json object using $.each() but the ordering is not guaranteed. Is there any way oredering can remain intact?
[06:44:50] <ph88> sl33k_: what would you like to order by ?
[06:45:52] <sl33k_> ph88: the same as that it was on the server (LinkedHashMap using Java)
[06:47:05] <ph88> so you are sending a json ?
[06:47:30] <sl33k_> yes
[06:47:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you loop over objects or an array?
[06:47:45] <sl33k_> object
[06:48:01] <ph88> is it an object of objects ?
[06:48:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well then you can't sort them, you need a field to sort on
[06:48:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> try this: http://underscorejs.org/
[06:49:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is there a field in each of the objects to sort on?
[06:49:09] <ph88> are you trying to make him addict ?
[06:50:18] <sl33k_> yes the value of each(key,value)
[06:50:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so "value" is not an object?
[06:51:03] <sl33k_> yes not an object
[06:51:24] <sl33k_> {"1":"State"}
[06:51:35] <sl33k_> something like ^
[06:51:40] <ph88> that's gonna be tough ^^
[06:51:47] <ph88> have you run into situations where things are out of order ?
[06:52:16] <sl33k_> pardon me?
[06:53:52] <ph88> sl33k_:  you started with "but the ordering is not guaranteed"
[06:54:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob>  {"1":"State"} is object
[06:54:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> just loop, put them in an array and then sort the array
[06:55:26] <ph88> {"1":"State", "3": "foo", }
[06:55:34] <ph88> {"1":"State", "3": "foo", ""2": "bar"}
[06:55:37] <ph88> like that ?
[06:55:42] <ph88> and now you want to keep 1 3 2 ?
[06:56:12] <sl33k_> will look into converting to array. thanks
[06:56:44] <sl33k_> ph88: value part alphabetically so I need "bar" fiirst
[06:57:04] <ph88> aaahhh
[06:57:13] <ph88> that would be much easier if you would have said that straight away :P
[06:57:45] <ph88> do you need the key though ?
[06:57:53] <ph88> since it's numerical
[06:58:05] <sl33k_> ya i need it
[06:58:08] <ph88> array looks like a nice idea .. unless those keys represent database primary keys or something
[06:58:47] <ph88> i would go for this  [{id: "1", value:"State"},{id: "2", value:"State Nr 2"}]
[06:59:47] <sl33k_> array of object? how would you sort it?
[07:00:57] <ph88> well
[07:01:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sl33k_, why don't you paste your data somewhere, that makes it easier!
[07:01:58] <ph88> ye also why not let the server sort it ?
[07:03:59] <sl33k_> I mentioned the server sorting it
[07:04:30] <ph88> count on the array keeping in the right order
[07:04:41] <sl33k_> and keeping it in LinkedHashMap (you will know if you program in java)
[07:04:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you use underscore, it's extremely eeasy...
[07:05:07] <sl33k_> underscore looks promising.
[07:05:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Look at the sortby function: http://underscorejs.org/
[07:05:17] <ph88> look at this
[07:05:19] <ph88> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[07:05:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It helped me so much with reading json data
[07:05:25] <ph88> scroll down to part:   Objects can be sorted given the value of one of their property.
[07:06:05] <ph88> underscorejs doesn't have sorting for array (because it already exist in javascript). It does have sorting for collections.
[07:06:13] <ph88> Collections are nice to work with, but not always the best choice
[07:08:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I had no idea javascript could sort on objects
[07:33:14] <Armistice> http://jsbin.com/IMUWuna/1/ any reason why close, won't get added to the container?
[07:36:41] <Armistice> Oh could have somethin to do with the fact I ofrgot <a />
[07:37:00] <ph88> missing some html / css  :|
[07:46:05] <Guest1301> Hello - I'm trying to get how async requests work and how I should call them but I think I'm still doing something wrong. My goal is to save the result from $.getJSON in the variable data. (and $.getJSON loads it from an URL) - here's what I got so far code wise http://pastebin.com/BRfnY6t1 - it seems to pass it correctly to the second function (cvp_jsonp) which is how I thought it should be done because it was async and all, but
[07:46:08] <Guest1301> call
[07:48:04] <x-finite> ecky--ptang-zoob, are you logged in from some server?
[07:50:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> qué?
[07:57:23] <Armistice> http://178.78.101.246:6022/ I have a small draggable window here (may take a while to load as it's using sockets and what not) but when you drag it.. it only contains to right and bottom axis of body, left and top isn't contained at all. Any suggestions?
[07:57:43] <x-finite> ecky--ptang-zoob, my mistake :)
[07:59:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> qué?
[08:07:27] <ph88> Armistice: what kind of drag technology do you use ? it feels laggy :|
[08:07:54] <Armistice> ph88: it's jquery.ui draggable.
[08:08:16] <ph88> damn i am gonna use that too
[08:08:19] <ph88> that's unfortunate :|
[08:08:33] <anthonym> Phorex.Drag(c, i);
[08:08:52] <Armistice> Doesn't appear laggy for me though... well, it's definitely not as smooth as like dragging your normal OS window but it's still not too bad.
[08:12:11] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/XJaMH/ seemed to work there. hmm
[08:13:03] <Armistice> thinkit might be my negative margin tops and lefts just to center the window in the first place...
[08:13:50] <Armistice> Damnit yes it is...
[08:15:33] <eliudnir> being new to this, is that as good as draggable gets? I feel like the tracking is spotty
[08:16:54] <Armistice> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6876 basically the containment is effected by the elements margin.
[08:17:03] <Armistice> I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed?
[08:17:14] <Guest1301> Repeating, sorry - I'm trying to get how async requests work and how I should call them but I think I'm still doing something wrong. My goal is to save the result from $.getJSON in the variable data. (and $.getJSON loads it from an URL) - here's what I got so far code wise http://pastebin.com/BRfnY6t1 - it seems to pass it correctly to the second function (cvp_jsonp) which is how I thought it should be done because it was async a
[08:17:37] <Armistice> eliudnir: there are probably other draggable methods which may or may not be better... but that's currently what jquery ui has.
[08:18:17] <eliudnir> ok - seems to me like the tracking "chases" the the mouse, it'll end up where you stop, but the acceleration/easing doesn't track the mouse movements
[08:18:56] <Armistice> Guest1301: You need to return the value from cvp_json on line 3. So... return cvp_json(json);
[08:19:23] <Armistice> Guest1301: basically you're returning out of one function but not the other... so the original call, won't get the return value you are expecting.
[08:19:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Armistice: are you trying to put the url image inside the window?
[08:20:25] <Armistice> Rohan_Bhangui: I'm sorry? I'm just trying to make the draggable window be contained in the body, but the negative margin on the window in the first place (to originally center screen it) is throwing it off course.
[08:20:48] <shoky> Guest1301: returning from the .getJSON callback won't help you either. you can't do a sync return of data that you got from an async callback
[08:21:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh okay i thought that 'chatolia.com' image you wanted inside the draggable window
[08:21:46] <Armistice> Noo Rohan_Bhangui haha :P
[08:22:25] <Guest1301> just tried that shoky - does indeed not work sadly
[08:22:55] <shoky> Guest1301: your functions are not doing anything with the data anyway.. what are they for
[08:23:33] <shoky> var request = $.getJSON(url);   request.done(function(data) { console.log(data) })
[08:24:41] <Guest1301> well it's just as an example, there's nothing there yet... It is for on the page there will be an empty div, and the returned json data must be constructed to form a channel viewer
[08:24:54] <shoky> use callbacks
[08:24:58] <shoky> do whatever you needfunction cvp_jsonp(data) {
[08:24:58] <shoky>         console.log(data); // console.log here does work
[08:24:58] <shoky>         return data;
[08:24:58] <shoky> }
[08:25:00] <shoky> oops
[08:25:36] <shoky> if you want something to happen after the ajax request is finished, it needs to go in a callback
[08:28:31] <Armistice> http://pastebin.com/3KHTwSKD think this is what shoky means by callback?
[08:28:46] <shoky> that's one way
[08:29:11] <Guest1301> yeah lots of stuff need to happen with the data received from that getjson stuff :p I've been trying callbacks but unable to figure out how to use them.. I had something like this before when messing with them...  http://pastebin.com/LpL4FJHr
[08:29:18] <Guest1301> It's probably really wrong though >.<
[08:29:32] <shoky> i prefer something more like:  http://pastebin.com/rVvMQ6rd
[08:34:35] <Guest1301> That's awesome shoky - thanks
[08:41:46] <Armistice> Has anyone ever used .position in jquery ui before?
[08:42:28] <shoky> a while ago, yah
[08:45:28] <Armistice> I can't seem to center a window. I was able to do it in jsfiddle... but ugh
[08:47:12] <shoky> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[08:47:28] <Armistice> http://178.78.101.246:6022/ I'm trying to use position to center it.. I know that it wont' center vertically because body isn't 100% height but horizontally it should... at least it did http://jsfiddle.net/XJaMH/1/ here
[08:48:20] <Armistice> Looks as if position isn't doing anything.
[08:53:21] <Armistice> aaaah. it seems to be new in jquery 2.x
[08:54:44] <shoky> what?
[08:55:24] <Armistice> Nevermind I forgot to add jquery ui. http://jsfiddle.net/XJaMH/3/ it works here.. just doesn't work here: http://178.78.101.246:6022/ it uses the same css for the window generation, same javascript.. just. does. not. work.
[08:55:27] <shoky> you don't have the position included i think
[08:55:40] <Armistice> oh... i should do, draggable depends on it i think
[08:55:41] <Armistice> lemme see.
[08:55:45] <shoky> your jquery-ui isn't full:  * Includes: jquery.ui.core.js, jquery.ui.widget.js, jquery.ui.mouse.js, jquery.ui.draggable.js
[08:56:14] <shoky> no jquery.ui.position.js
[08:56:49] <Armistice> Ah.. shoot. Yeah just looked now. I thought position was one of hte dependencies. damnit.
[08:57:11] <Armistice> Rofl I get so stressed out at times. Would of been nice if javascript shown an error ".position is not defined" or somethign
[08:57:33] <shoky> but it is defined :)
[08:57:39] <shoky> jquery core has .position as well
[08:57:55] <shoky> but yeah, this kind of thing sucks
[08:58:39] <Armistice> Does it? So what does the core .position do?
[08:58:47] <shoky> `api position
[08:58:47] <b-ot> shoky: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[08:59:16] <shoky> jquery-ui overrides it
[09:01:27] <Armistice> oh yeah you said jquery. My minds al over the place today, sorry.
[09:02:08] <shoky> s'all good
[09:04:51] <g33kyboi> Hi
[09:05:19] <Armistice> Ok so using .position, it won't keep the element center when the window is resized. So, I used the .resize event. What happens now is that if someone was to move the div out of center position, and then resized the window.. it would bounce back to center. How would I go about this? I thought about having a boolean which is changed the false when the window was dragged but not sure if .draggable supports that functionality.
[09:05:28] <Armistice> Looked at the api but not sure... was expecting a callback or somethign
[09:06:10] <g33kyboi> I need to dynamically set the css class for an html element using javascript. is this right? document.getElementById("elementId").class = "someClass";
[09:06:40] <Armistice> oh there is a drag callback. I'll try this
[09:09:01] <Leeffen> how come that my varriable "el" does not get updated? http://pastebin.com/W9dqn2g3
[09:10:28] <MariusIT> guys, i'm trying to find the correct target so I can slide only one aside class at a time, any ideea what it might be http://jsfiddle.net/AEAPT/ ?
[09:11:46] <shoky> Leeffen: el is html. $(el) is a new jquery object with the elements from that html. you're modifying these elemetns in the jquery object, not in the original html
[09:12:04] <shoky> Leeffen: just remove the .html() at the end of line 2
[09:12:44] <Leeffen> arh, thanks :)
[09:13:11] <eliudnir> hi guys, i'm using load() when a button is pressed to change the content of a div by loading a html file - is there any way to force the use of separate css file on the html loaded into the div? including it with <link> in the loaded .html doesn't work :( i apologize if that was confusing, i'm new to all this
[09:13:39] <Armistice> Can you show us some code eliudnir ?
[09:13:59] <Armistice> http://jsbin.com/ISARAga/1/ This little window creation process works... however I'm pretty sure it's poor quality. Was wondering if anyone has any tips/advice on how to improve it? :)
[09:16:55] <shoky> Armistice: seems fine to me
[09:23:17] <Armistice> shoky: you think? Hmm.. usually things I do end up with a billion "bad practises".
[09:33:34] <Armistice> shoky: I read that 'class' is a reserved word and should be quoted instead. If I had var obj = { "class" : "foo" }; obj.class is seen as 'invalid' as it's using a reserved word, how would I access it instead?
[09:37:04] <MariusIT> does jquery works with <aside> ?
[09:38:09] <Armistice> I don't see why not.
[09:38:44] <Armistice> Actually if anything jquery will work with any element with any name. As to whether it's valid html, is another question.
[09:45:55] <MariusIT> I'm trying to find the 'target' in the fallowing jquery script http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/ it was working fine before '<aside>' jumped it. It has to toggle only one features-content class at a time. Any help would be appreciated.
[09:47:08] <lin0de> Hi. Suppose I have few buttons with similar actions bound to them. Should I use jQuery triggers or HTML onclick?
[09:47:51] <Cork> lin0de: to trigger them you mean?
[09:48:26] <Armistice> The moments when something that is center, doesn't look center.
[09:48:38] <lin0de> Yes
[09:49:13] <Armistice> I prefer to use jquery.click, cleans up my html a litt.e
[09:49:27] <lin0de> Like $( "#target" ).click(function() {...
[09:49:52] <lin0de> In this case, I want to make POST to abc.php in button 1 and def.php on button 2
[09:50:05] <Cork> MariusIT: var features = $('.features-collapsed'); target = features.eq(features.index(this) + 1);
[09:50:52] <Cork> lin0de: uh, trigger triggers a click, do you want to trigger an existing event listener or add a new one?
[09:51:26] <Armistice> I could be wrong but I think lin0de is asking if it's better to use the onclick attribute in html, or use jquerys .click
[09:51:33] <lin0de> Yes, exactly
[09:51:50] <Cork> MariusIT: next() looks for the next sibling, and aside isn't a sibling to the article
[09:52:21] <MariusIT> target is a variable right? http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/1/
[09:52:23] <Cork> lin0de: js should be in <script> sections or preferably a separate file
[09:52:36] <Cork> lin0de: so yes don't use the old event attributes
[09:52:45] <Cork> use modern event listeners instead
[09:53:01] <Cork> MariusIT: yes
[09:53:02] <Armistice> Somes chrome dev tools will look for a jquery map file, how does it figure out the filename? I downloaded the relevant map file but not sure if it'd be the right file name. The map file is as it was downloaded, but jquery is under jquery.min.js, would I need to rename the map file to jquery.min.map ?
[09:53:22] <Cork> MariusIT: also you could remove that loop, it isn't needed
[09:54:10] <Cork> MariusIT: opps read the original fiddle wrong, give me a min to fix it
[09:54:44] <Cork> MariusIT: hmm
[09:55:01] <Cork> how is the relation between the features-collapsed and content suppose to be?
[09:55:22] <Cork> always <article><div></div></article><aside></aside> ?
[09:55:30] <MariusIT> Cork: yes
[09:56:14] <Cork> MariusIT: http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/2/
[09:56:42] <MariusIT> Cork: I love you! :x
[09:56:54] <MariusIT> Cork: Thank you!
[09:57:08] <Cork> MariusIT: alternatively you can do .closest('.article-list').find('.features-content')
[09:57:25] <MariusIT> Cork: How can I remove that loop? You sayd something about it earlyer.
[09:57:27] <Cork> would be a bit more resistant to breakage
[09:57:44] <MariusIT> ok, will use that instead
[09:58:54] <Cork> MariusIT: http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/3/
[09:59:04] <MariusIT> Cork: no, the alternative dosen't work, it's fine with parent, rly
[10:02:45] <Cork> Armistice: it is specified at the top of the minified file
[10:03:10] <Cork> Armistice: //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map <-- ex.
[10:03:10] <Armistice> Oh yeah I did not notice that Cork thanks :)
[10:03:48] <MariusIT> Cork: thanks for the alternative '.closest('.article-list').find('.features-content')' looks like it's working better on realtime with it
[10:04:14] <Ericx2x> Hey guys, I know this isn't a jQuery question but the CSS channel is dead at the moment so I figured I'd ask it here.
[10:04:15] <Ericx2x> Does anyone know how to move the text in these boxes vertically up? http://jsfiddle.net/QMfd6/1/
[10:04:37] <Cork> MariusIT: it jumps up to the article-list and then searches for the child, so as long as it is anywhere inside the closest article-list it will work
[10:04:42] <Cork> so it should be safer
[10:05:17] <Cork> Ericx2x: what box?
[10:05:31] <Ericx2x> You dont see the four boxes? http://jsfiddle.net/QMfd6/3/
[10:05:43] <Cork> sure, so you mean all of them?
[10:05:46] <Ericx2x> yes
[10:06:03] <Ericx2x> well any of them
[10:08:45] <Cork> Ericx2x: i only did it on the first one as you don't have a shared class http://jsfiddle.net/QMfd6/5/
[10:08:54] <Ericx2x> Cork Thanks
[10:09:30] <Cork> Ericx2x: http://jsfiddle.net/QMfd6/6/
[10:09:34] <Cork> even mer top :)
[10:09:38] <Cork> *more
[10:09:49] <Nebukadneza> heho
[10:10:02] <Cork> Ericx2x: and ya vertical-align on img might be what you want
[10:10:30] <Ericx2x> Okay, I'll try to go from here. Thanks/
[10:10:38] <Cork> np
[10:10:56] <Nebukadneza> i was wondering why ?.get(someUrl, {my: para, me: ters}); encoded those parameters so strangely ... it encodes "this is a test" as "this+is+a+test" instead of "this%20is%20..." Oo? and maybe ... how can i make it encode in the %<hex> way?
[10:11:45] <Cork> Nebukadneza: + instead of %20 is common cause it make the text more readable
[10:12:08] <Nebukadneza> mh yeah, but i don't want a specialcase in my server
[10:12:13] <Nebukadneza> and it makes encoding "+" more complicated ;)
[10:12:29] <Nebukadneza> that said, i'd prefer the standard %<hex> encoding, somehow ;/
[10:12:48] <Cork> Nebukadneza: though that said it should be %20 by default
[10:12:57] <Cork> ?js> print(encodeURIComponent("this is a test"))
[10:13:02] <b-ot> Cork: this%20is%20a%20test
[10:13:13] <Nebukadneza> $.get(httproot+"call", {gid: game_id, uuid: uuid, calltype: command}); is my exact call
[10:14:01] <Cork> ah
[10:14:04] <Cork> s.join( "&" ).replace( r20, "+" )
[10:14:05] <Nebukadneza> if i manually encode "command" (which is the only string that can include spaces or specialcharacters) before using $.get, it gets double-encoded
[10:14:16] <Cork> so ya, jquery replaces %20 with +
[10:14:32] <Cork> and there isn't really a way to prevent that
[10:14:32] <Nebukadneza> at what point? and ... what "s"? :P
[10:14:43] <Cork> that is from $.param
[10:14:53] <Cork> it is what converts your object
[10:15:24] <Nebukadneza> mhh, i can't say i follow
[10:15:24] <Cork> you could do your own paramereize function and give jquery a pure string
[10:15:40] <Cork> Nebukadneza: when you call $.get(url, data)
[10:15:50] <Cork> jquery checks if data is an array or object
[10:15:56] <Nebukadneza> so i don't use the parameter to pass data as a dict, but manually write them into a string and append it to the url?
[10:15:58] <Cork> if it is it calls $.param(data)
[10:16:03] <Cork> that converts data to a string
[10:16:13] <Nebukadneza> so, query = query+s.join... something here; $.get(query);
[10:17:09] <MariusIT> Cork: how can I include toggleClass in this script? $(this).closest('.article-list') dosen't seem to do the job http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/4/
[10:17:24] <Cork> Nebukadneza: 'my=' + encodeURIComponent(para) + '&me=' + encodeURIComponent(ters)
[10:17:37] <Nebukadneza> yeah, something like that ;/
[10:17:46] <Cork> Nebukadneza: or you need to make a function that converts the object to string without the + replacement
[10:17:55] <Nebukadneza> yeah
[10:18:02] <Cork> Nebukadneza: though all normal form parsers should accept + for %20
[10:18:08] <Nebukadneza> okay, will hack something nice-looking together ;)
[10:18:13] <Cork> so it really shouldn't be a problem
[10:18:14] <Nebukadneza> yeah, we have a longpolling python server
[10:18:19] <Nebukadneza> we decode it by hand ;/
[10:18:28] <Cork> so fix the decoder to follow the spec :)
[10:19:47] <Cork> Nebukadneza: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1
[10:20:03] <Cork> "Control names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as described in [RFC1738]"
[10:25:47] <MariusIT> Any ideea how to make toggleClass reset all classes to default except targeted one http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/4/ ?
[10:28:49] <Cork> MariusIT: you shouldn't do that
[10:29:23] <Cork> those scripts can't coexist with other scripts, so you will end up in a modification game where the script has to be modified every time you want to add a feature
[10:29:35] <Cork> instead only touch things you add in the script
[10:29:40] <Cork> and leave everything else as is
[10:30:35] <MariusIT> hmm
[10:30:39] <MariusIT> what's the best approach to add some color to the current toggled class?
[10:31:36] <Cork> MariusIT: have a class for enabled elements or similar
[10:31:40] <Cork> and just toggle that class
[10:32:45] <MariusIT> I did that, but it remains toggled when I click other classes
[10:33:22] <MariusIT> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/4/
[10:33:28] <Cork> so remove all of the classes on each click
[10:33:37] <Cork> and add it to the currently clicked element
[10:33:49] <MariusIT> i don't know how :(
[10:34:39] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/5/
[10:35:13] <MariusIT> no way! it can't be that easy!
[10:35:21] <Cork> :)
[10:35:52] <MariusIT> Cork: thanks!
[10:35:57] <Cork> np
[10:45:48] <Ericx2x> Does anyone know how to validate on localhost without using wc3 validator?
[10:47:18] <Armistice> Cork haha I was close with that: http://jsfiddle.net/PjAZR/6/ I toggled it instead but whatever. :P
[10:47:27] <vydd> hi, did anyone come across a jquery plugin that would let my users change fonts the same way they'd do that in any text editor? so, font-family, font-size, font-weight and font-style selectors, all grouped nicely so I don't have to code that myself :)
[10:47:35] * Armistice was obviously too slow
[10:49:46] <Cork> Ericx2x: there are some extensions for browsers (they don't work very well though)
[10:50:03] <Cork> Ericx2x: or you can download the w3c validator, but it is complicated to get it running
[10:50:28] <Cork> Ericx2x: some ide's has built in support for some of the validators
[10:51:23] <Cork> vydd: don't think there is one, though it shouldn't be too hard making a dropdown like that
[10:54:28] <vydd> Cork: yeah, I did find nice font-family selectors which I'll consider modifying to my needs if I don't find the "perfect" solution which would include other selectors as well...but that part is thankfully covered
[10:58:42] <vydd> http://www.visualmedia.nl/html5/fontpicker/ < that one is closest to what I want, so I'll probably end up decoupling it from google fonts api and including style combo. thanks anyway
[11:07:06] <DarkGhost> Hello, with this code: http://privatepaste.com/1ff26d0435 for some reason I keep getting multiselect is not a function, but if I mvoe the code to the bottom of the page it works.
[11:10:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it possible to overlay position relative divs
[11:10:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> on top of one another withing parent container
[11:19:38] <nezZario> i've had a long day
[11:21:07] <nezZario> i can't think straight.  If I have $x I need it to === false for an if() not to fire
[11:21:42] <nezZario> or hell, i need sleep, i said it wrong
[11:23:44] <nezZario> omg, if($x === false) {
[11:23:48] <nezZario> wow i'm taking a nap...
[11:24:53] <coderfromcincy> can someone tell me why this works in firefox but not IE9 and Chrome? ----> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanj/mDc7p/
[11:27:38] <nezZario> coderfromcincy: for the record, i'm in chrome and some page loaded .. but you're going to get better help in a javascript channel
[11:27:47] <nezZario> you wouldn't ask a plumber how to wire your electric would you?
[11:28:08] <coderfromcincy> figured i would start here since its a jquery plugin
[11:28:15] <nezZario> omg
[11:28:17] <nezZario> OMG
[11:28:26] <nezZario> i'm definately taking that nap
[11:28:38] <nezZario> i'm in the wrong channel.  in sincerely apologize.
[11:28:48] <nezZario> but it did work in chrome here :)
[11:28:52] <coderfromcincy> what version
[11:28:55] <coderfromcincy> you saw the events?
[11:29:11] <nezZario> I seen a page load
[11:29:24] <coderfromcincy> but did it say 'loading events"
[11:29:26] <coderfromcincy> and not ever load
[11:29:47] <nezZario> no, it said "loading events" then a page loaded
[11:29:53] <coderfromcincy> wtf
[11:29:57] <coderfromcincy> chrome version?
[11:30:06] <nezZario> Version 30.0.1599.101 m
[11:30:41] <coderfromcincy> what is the name of the first event you see
[11:32:15] <coderfromcincy> dude there is no way, it doesnt even make any sense that it works
[11:32:37] <coderfromcincy> im using same browser
[11:33:16] <coderfromcincy>  http://jsfiddle.net/ryanj/mDc7p/ does NOT work work in my google chrome
[11:46:24] <kilian123> hi, which way do you use, to fetch  data like forms etc from the server?
[11:46:38] <kilian123> just information about the required fields, or easily as html?
[11:57:22] <DarkGhost> Hello, with this code: http://privatepaste.com/1ff26d0435 for some reason I keep getting multiselect is not a function, but if I mvoe the code to the bottom of the page it works.
[12:00:13] <DarkGhost> ?

[12:12:53] <LoneSoldier728> does that get the value of a field

[12:13:36] <MariusIT> I'm looking for a way to distribute the function(data) {} elements amongst 3 columns evenly. Any toughts?
[12:14:50] <DarkGhost> Hello, with this code: http://privatepaste.com/1ff26d0435 for some reason I keep getting multiselect is not a function, but if I mvoe the code to the bottom of the page it works.
[12:14:50] <orangeP> Hello!
[12:17:09] <orangeP> Does anyone know why this dropdown menu columnizer stops working after I bind it to pageinit? http://jsfiddle.net/orange/QE7qq/1/
[12:17:12] <orangeP> Trying to adhere to http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/ which says: "We recommend binding to pageinit instead of DOM ready() because this will work regardless of whether the page is loaded directly or if the content is pulled into another page as part of the Ajax navigation system."
[12:17:21] <der_On> hi. I need to reload an iframe and it's css files while bypassing the browser cache. is that possible?
[12:20:10] <zandman_26> Hi all, I need some help with file uploading.. backend is RoR
[12:21:30] <zandman_26> and my problem is to actually attach the file loaded in to jquery to the RoR hash parameter for the file
[12:22:10] <DarkGhost> Hello, with this code: http://privatepaste.com/1ff26d0435 for some reason I keep getting multiselect is not a function, but if I mvoe the code to the bottom of the page it works.
[12:25:01] <zandman_26> DarkGhost thats probebly because the if you put it at the bottom the muliselect has actually been assigned
[12:25:25] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here that would know how I can get images to be the same height as flexslider height?
[12:25:40] <DarkGhost> zandman_26 how do  I make it workat top?
[12:26:18] <coderfromcincy> $("#flexslidercontainer > img").height() = $("#flexslidercontainerID").height();
[12:26:48] <coderfromcincy> and make sure you explicitly assign a height to the container of the images
[12:27:29] <zandman_26> wrap the code in $(function($) { // your code goes here });
[12:27:50] <zandman_26> should fix it
[12:30:36] <DarkGhost> zandman_26 thats a document.ready right?
[12:30:42] <zandman_26> yes
[12:31:16] <DarkGhost> zandman_26 yeah thats already around it..
[12:32:15] <Forbidd3n> coderfromcincy: the image is larger than the height I want to flexslider and flexslider is expanding to the largest image size
[12:33:30] <MariusIT> Hey guys, any ideea how to change the output of this http://jsfiddle.net/hfTx3/ from this '[["A"], ["B"], ["C"]]' into this '<ul><li>A</li></ul> <ul><li>B</li></ul> <ul><li>C</li></ul>' ???
[12:33:35] <Forbidd3n> coderfromcincy: I have <div class="slider-wrapper"><div id="slider-home"><ul class="slides"><li...></ul>
[12:34:50] <Forbidd3n> this isn't even valid js
[12:34:50] <Forbidd3n> $("#home-slider > img").height() = $("#home-slider").height();
[12:38:46] <coderfromcincy> as a matter of fact it is
[12:38:54] <coderfromcincy> but go ahead and send mean example forbindden
[12:39:00] <coderfromcincy> JSFIDDLE
[12:41:13] <zandman_26> DarkGhost what I can see you have not called on jquery.js and jquery-ui.min.js, could that be it?
[12:42:01] <Armistice> I have a loop that generates a div, puts in it's data and I want to append it to a jquery object for later use. How can I do this? I tried doing var foo = $(); then later on in the loop... .appendTo(foo) but to no avail.
[12:42:08] <DarkGhost> zandman_26 jquery-ui is in that pastebin. and jquery.js is also being called on just not in that script
[12:45:49] <pixelpimp> Armistice: you have the right method, but are probably doing something wrong in terms of order.  Try putting your code up on jsfiddle so someone can take a look and see
[12:46:51] <Armistice> pixelpimp: I cannot really give a working example but here: http://jsbin.com/uyotOJa/1/
[12:47:49] <pixelpimp> your appendto isn't being called
[12:48:01] <pixelpimp> the letter preceding it is a ;
[12:48:48] <pixelpimp> but otherwise seems okay to me
[12:49:23] <zandman_26> DarkGhost well if it all works well if it's just called at the bottom of the page, it must be that a resource that is required is not loaded at the place where you put it in the head
[12:51:15] <zandman_26> Does someone here work with jquery and RoR? Cause I need help with passing parameters between these languages
[12:51:31] <DarkGhost> zandman_26 well the problem is it doesn't all work well wherever I place it.. if you look at the privatepaste the  $.getJSON("/inc/add_problem_attributes.php", function(data) { } doesn't work when the multiselect function does
[12:52:30] <Armistice> That would of been a typo pixelpimp I was trying otherthings and had to revert and it got accidently left there.
[12:56:07] <tieTYT> I've got a function where $(this) is what I want.  But it's calling another function, and when I do that, $(this) seems to be something different.  Is there any way to set the $(this) of the function I call without passing it in as a parameter?
[12:57:40] <tieTYT> i figured it out, that's what call is for, I guess
[12:58:25] <DarkGhost> pixelpimp any idea for my problem?
[13:07:46] <mehwork> is there a better way of ensuring a .show() will render properly on an ipad than putting in it in a setTimeout to delay it after other stuff has loaded?
[13:12:15] <MariusIT> any ideea how to make this return a valid html result? <ul><li> format? http://jsfiddle.net/hfTx3/
[13:14:07] <grafi> oÃ´
[13:14:20] <grafi> like a simple list MariusIT
[13:14:39] <DarkGhost> with this code: http://privatepaste.com/1ff26d0435 for some reason I keep getting multiselect is not a function, but if I mvoe the code to the bottom of the page it works. but even when I put it to the bottom of the page, the code inside $.getjson doesn't work
[13:15:35] <Eviltwin> DarkGhost: Did you also include jQuery?
[13:15:36] <MariusIT> grafi: I can't replace [] with li since it breaks the count ...
[13:15:46] <DarkGhost> Eviltwin yes of course
[13:15:56] <Eviltwin> Okay, I didn't see it in your paste
[13:16:11] <DarkGhost> Eviltwin yeah its not full code but... important aprt
[13:16:39] <Eviltwin> I suggest downloading jquery.multiselect.js and hosting it on your server
[13:16:48] <DarkGhost> Eviltwin any reason
[13:16:51] <Eviltwin> GitHub doesn't like people trying to use them for hosting
[13:16:57] <grafi> im not sure i understand what you want oÃ´ MariusIT just turn the items from the array into <ul><li></li></ul> ?
[13:17:02] <DarkGhost> thats not going to make it work though
[13:17:08] <Eviltwin> And may be actively preventing that from working
[13:17:30] <MariusIT> grafi: yes
[13:17:50] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/hfTx3/1/
[13:18:28] <MariusIT> grafi: oh, no, they have to be distributed ammongst 3 different columns evenly
[13:18:37] <MariusIT> grafi: that's why I added the math
[13:18:49] <MariusIT> grafi: the math works, but the output ...
[13:18:52] <grafi> i see :)
[13:19:01] <grafi> thats where my confusion came from
[13:19:12] <DarkGhost> Eviltwin I mean I'll do it but any other reasoning?
[13:19:49] <shoky> what better reason do you need
[13:20:02] <grafi> so the columns are then individual lists MariusIT ?
[13:20:14] <Eviltwin> It's the only reason I can think of off hand for it not working
[13:20:28] <MariusIT> grafi: yes, eatch column is defined by one list and one or multiple elements
[13:21:14] <DarkGhost> Eviltwin well the multiselecct works if I put it at the bottom.. the real problem is the options aren't getting added by the getjson thing
[13:24:48] <imperialboozer> when i do an $.ajax all of the data i send just gets turned into a string and appended to the url?
[13:25:00] <shoky> DarkGhost: more info/code needed. when are you calling populateAttributes? "if I put it at the bottom" doesn't help much
[13:25:31] <DarkGhost> okay shoky get ready for a mess... I didn't code all of this but here a go
[13:25:52] <MariusIT> grafi: any toughts?
[13:26:04] <DarkGhost> shoky http://privatepaste.com/0264820143 jquery.min.js is included in one of those includes but theres the whole page really
[13:27:51] <shoky> DarkGhost: and have you tried Eviltwin's suggestion? or alternatively change raw.github.com  to rawgithub.com
[13:28:06] <DarkGhost> shoky ill do that right now.
[13:28:20] <DarkGhost> done
[13:28:48] <DarkGhost> shoky Error: TypeError: jQuery(...).multiselect is not a function
[13:29:14] <grafi> MariusIT http://jsfiddle.net/hfTx3/2/ something like this?
[13:29:14] <shoky> and you can see it loaded the multiselect script ok?
[13:30:53] <MariusIT> grafi: yes, but that looks kinda messy ...
[13:32:57] <shoky> DarkGhost: also.. where did you say jquery is included?
[13:33:08] <DarkGhost> shoky yes.. so if I put the populateattributes at end of script it will load the mutliselect and work, but not load the options
[13:33:14] <DarkGhost> and its in one fo the includes at the top
[13:33:16] <grafi> it probably kinda is, have yet to see a better way though MariusIT :)
[13:33:19] <shoky> DarkGhost: which one?
[13:33:26] <DarkGhost> doctype.php
[13:33:45] <shoky> oh the php includes
[13:34:10] <shoky> pastebin the outputted html
[13:34:12] <shoky> no php plz
[13:34:49] <MariusIT> grafi: i think it can be done in only one loop ...
[13:35:02] <grafi> if you can, do :)
[13:35:19] <grafi> im just here for your inspiration
[13:35:20] <grafi> :p
[13:35:26] <MariusIT> :D
[13:35:32] <DarkGhost> shoky oh. I got it by moving it all to the bottom now it loads too
[13:35:35] <MariusIT> let me see what i can do
[13:35:45] <MariusIT> grafi ty btw
[13:35:50] <grafi> no problem
[13:36:27] <shoky> DarkGhost: so you're satisfied?
[13:36:41] <shoky> (i wouldn't be)
[13:37:02] <DarkGhost> well if I take the multiselect out of the .success() portion
[13:37:05] <DarkGhost> it doesn't load the options
[13:37:06] <DarkGhost> ugh.
[13:40:38] <schoppenhauer> hello. does JQuery have a function to parse the URL (window.location.href) to get the "GET" parameters of the current website?
[13:41:00] <schoppenhauer> there are a lot of code snippets out there claiming to do so, but does jquery have something included?
[13:42:00] <shoky> schoppenhauer: nope
[13:42:24] <schoppenhauer> shoky: meh. is there any "recommended" way to do so then?
[13:42:46] <schoppenhauer> many people use regex
[13:42:49] <schoppenhauer> but I am not sure ...
[13:43:09] <schoppenhauer> do I unescape location.href first, and then use regex? or after regex?
[13:43:25] <schoppenhauer> and then I would still have to replace + by ... something else.
[13:47:57] <shoky> this seems fine to me  http://stackoverflow.com/a/8764051/1098884
[13:53:45] <schoppenhauer> shoky: at least it is a start, yes.
[13:54:03] <schoppenhauer> shoky: it does not handle the case when there are multiple instances of the same argument, I think
[13:56:45] <shoky> oh well
[14:09:28] <LoneSoldier728> is it possible to do a post with a get in the success callback
[14:09:39] <shoky> sure
[14:11:25] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[14:11:26] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19471140/backbone-fetch-right-after-save
[14:11:34] <LoneSoldier728> u might not understand this because it is in backbone
[14:11:37] <LoneSoldier728> but does that make sense
[14:11:44] <LoneSoldier728> fetch is a get supposedly
[14:12:04] <shoky> you got an answer
[14:14:08] <LoneSoldier728> ya it didnt help tho
[14:14:40] <shoky> it's right tho
[14:48:23] <MariusIT> any ideeas? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19471531/javascript-evenly-distribute-data-into-columns
[14:55:57] <BillCriswell> MariusIT: Use .slice.
[15:12:37] <relipse> i have <td><select>...</td><td><input></td>      when the select box changes, I want to change the value of the input in the next td over
[15:13:58] <relipse> $('select').change(function(){ $(this).next('input').val('foobar'); } <---- like this?
[15:14:04] <_rgn> relipse: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1702930/selecting-the-next-sibling-of-this-parent
[15:14:55] <relipse> _rgn honestly i think the whole idea of using .parent() is very screwy and if the html changes slightly it fails
[15:15:03] <relipse> there has got to be a betterw ay
[15:15:15] <_rgn> well find a better way to structure your markup
[15:16:57] <_rgn> one way would be to "connect" select and input with some kind of attribute
[15:17:32] <_rgn> read the attribute from select and find input based on that attribute (id, data-<something>)
[15:18:46] <relipse> i only say that because i've used parent in the past previously and it always gets cruddy issues
[15:18:52] <relipse> yeah i'm just going to use the id, thanks
[15:19:18] <relipse> i think you could traverse the dom though in a non-hackish way
[15:20:10] <_rgn> i don't think it's any more hackish than traversing dom is in general
[15:20:52] <_rgn> and parent() accepts selector too
[15:24:10] <relipse> _rgn, i'm thinking of something like this: findParentUntil('td').next('td').find('input')
[15:24:19] <relipse> that way no matter how deep you are inside the <td>
[15:24:33] <relipse> but yes even that seems hacky
[15:24:39] <relipse> best is probably just id
[15:24:54] <_rgn> .parents('td') is your findParentUntil
[15:25:19] <relipse> and then i need the next td after that
[15:25:27] <relipse> (even if the html is sscrewy)
[15:25:39] <shoky> .closest is usually best
[15:25:42] <MariusIT> any ideea how to make this work if there are less then 3 elements in array http://jsfiddle.net/hfTx3/4/ ?
[15:26:10] <relipse> if my mcdonalds wifi woudl load the thing
[15:30:55] <relipse> What is the best option for a select box that allows inputing your own value?
[15:32:05] <Nebukadneza> re-heho
[15:32:24] <shoky> MariusIT: add an initial value of [] to the reduce:  .reduce(function(a,b){..}, [])
[15:33:19] <Nebukadneza> i have a div-field inside another div that i make resizable with jqueryui $("#...").resizable(). theres a input-field under the div-field. when i resize the resizable container horizontally, the div-field and input inside follow. not so for vertical resize ;/
[15:33:39] <shoky> MariusIT: sorry, i meant empty string not empty array
[15:33:50] <MariusIT> snoky: got it
[15:34:49] <MariusIT> snoky: it's working, thanks!
[15:35:01] <shoky> snoky ;D
[15:36:53] <MariusIT> snoky: noup, got a bug with it, the "," appears between the lines
[15:36:57] <shoky> Nebukadneza: sounds like you want height: 100%  or similar
[15:37:27] <shoky> MariusIT: where?
[15:38:52] <MariusIT> snoky: hold on, i think i messed something up, jsfiddle works fine
[15:39:14] <Nebukadneza> shoky: mh, nope ;( that breaks horribly
[15:39:43] <shoky> Nebukadneza: anyways it's a matter of doing the css right.. can't help without a demo
[15:39:51] <Nebukadneza> hrrr
[15:39:55] <Nebukadneza> demo is hard ;/
[15:41:14] <Nebukadneza> http://dyn.kanojo.de:8080/ -- can you surf here, log in with "aa" and "aa"
[15:41:38] <MariusIT> shoky: got it http://jsfiddle.net/hfTx3/7/
[15:41:40] <Nebukadneza> then join the game 'test'
[15:42:03] <Nebukadneza> if thats not too much to ask
[15:42:21] <shoky> MariusIT: i corrected myself, empty string, not empty array:  .reduce(function(a,b){..}, "")
[15:42:37] <MariusIT> shoky: missed that part :d
[15:42:47] <shoky> cause you're doing string string concatenation, not array concatenation
[15:43:16] <shoky> MariusIT: could not join game
[15:43:33] <MariusIT> shoky: not me, Nebukadneza
[15:43:37] <shoky> oops
[15:43:46] <shoky> i joined anyways ;p
[15:43:47] <MariusIT> shoky: works fine now, thanks
[15:43:52] <shoky> np
[15:44:02] <Nebukadneza> :P
[15:44:28] <Nebukadneza> do you see the chat window now?
[15:44:40] <shoky> ya
[15:45:09] <Nebukadneza> drag it around and try to resize it
[15:45:17] <Nebukadneza> horizontal resize works and vertical resize not ;/
[15:45:38] <shoky> right.. you have height: 160px
[15:45:53] <Nebukadneza> atm yes
[15:45:57] <Nebukadneza> height: 100% is broken too
[15:46:04] <Nebukadneza> can you change it in a debugger or should i change and you reload?
[15:46:16] <shoky> yeah 100% is too much because you've got other stuff in there
[15:46:34] <shoky> don't need you to change it
[15:46:56] <Nebukadneza> anything above around ~50% starts breaking
[15:47:01] <Nebukadneza> below it looks super awkward ;/
[15:47:21] <shoky> the way i'd do it is first of all to have this in the css:  * { box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box }
[15:47:42] <Nebukadneza> lemme read up
[15:47:51] <shoky> if you don't have that already it might make it neccessary to make some small adjustments to other css
[15:48:07] <Nebukadneza> in the inner or outer css?
[15:48:12] <shoky> but it makes working with widths and padding stuff much easier
[15:48:30] <shoky> donno what's inner or outer?
[15:48:49] <Nebukadneza> outer is the whole box to drag around, inner the darker grey box with the chat log
[15:48:59] <shoky> *  means for all elements ;p
[15:49:13] <Nebukadneza> ah
[15:49:15] <Nebukadneza> oops, sorry
[15:49:45] <Nebukadneza> mhh, trying
[15:50:14] <shoky> then i'd give a fixed height to the <h3> and <p> that are above the chatcont div
[15:50:38] <Nebukadneza> mh, ok
[15:52:04] <shoky> then make chatcont div:   position:absolute; left:0; right:0;
[15:53:21] <shoky> give the input a fixed height (or wrap it in a div with fixed height), and set it to: position:absolute; bottom:0; left:0; width:100%;
[15:53:48] <shoky> lastly give chatcont div a top and bottom that are the fixed heights you gave the other elements
[15:54:07] <shoky> can't load your site anymore so i cant check if that works ;p
[15:54:21] <Nebukadneza> i'm just trying to add all of this and test it ;p
[16:01:33] <Nebukadneza> shoky: starting to look better ;)
[16:01:35] <Nebukadneza> thanks!
[16:01:51] <sticky_> i have a problem with magnific popup. In chrome, when i click on an image, the first popup appears without overlay background. the second time i click on this or other image, the overlay appears
[16:02:07] <shoky> Nebukadneza: sweet, yw
[16:02:21] <sticky_> heres the link http://borjaperez.co.nf/
[16:06:06] <KempfCreative> Hello all.
[16:06:40] <sticky_> hi
[16:07:12] <KempfCreative> Would this be an okay place to ask for some help in understanding some code?
[16:08:52] <hugo_moss> hello, i'm having a problem with jquery's offset() method.  I have a navbar thats fixed at the top, and then below that i have content.  when i use the offset and refresh the window, sometimes its 1792 px, which is correct but other times its 795px. whats going on?
[16:08:59] <shoky> KempfCreative: sure, if it's jquery/javascript, and not a ton of code ;p
[16:09:39] <KempfCreative> just a small module :) you can see the gist here: https://gist.github.com/KempfCreative/7062582
[16:09:56] <hugo_moss> im getting two different values for offset when refreshing
[16:09:58] <KempfCreative> I am trying to add a delay to the add/removeClass, but I can't figure it out
[16:10:47] <shoky> KempfCreative: use setTimeout
[16:12:02] <shoky> just be careful about using "this" inside the callback
[16:12:11] <KempfCreative> Not sure where to put it since the .on function contains both the removal and addition of the class
[16:12:24] <shoky> i donno, wherever you want to delay it
[16:13:08] <shoky> var elem = $jQ(...);   setTimeout(function() { elem.removeClass(..) }, 500);
[16:14:33] <KempfCreative> shaky did you check out that gist?
[16:14:48] <Nebukadneza> shoky: "yw"?
[16:14:57] <shoky> KempfCreative yah
[16:15:02] <shoky> Nebukadneza: you're welcome ;p
[16:15:11] <hugo_moss> ok
[16:15:14] <Nebukadneza> ah ;)
[16:15:15] <Nebukadneza> thank you
[16:15:17] <hugo_moss> it must be the images are not loaded
[16:15:19] <Nebukadneza> and on that note, also good nite!
[16:15:29] <shoky> nighty
[16:16:36] <relipse>  how do i do keydown,keyup, change event all in one?
[16:17:06] <shoky> .on('keydown keyup change',   ?
[16:17:38] <shoky> there's also the cool 'input' event in modern browsers
[16:17:57] <relipse> ok so on('input', ...
[16:17:59] <relipse> ok thanks
[16:18:33] <relipse> does comma delimited work too?
[16:18:43] <shoky> no
[16:18:58] <shoky> at least, not documented as such
[16:19:05] <shoky> but i doubt it'd work
[16:19:54] <hugo_moss> is there some kind of jquery function similar to document.ready but instead wait for everything to load?
[16:20:27] <shoky> hugo_moss:  $(window).load
[16:21:16] <relipse> how do i clear all .onchange events if there is any
[16:21:34] <shoky> hm?
[16:21:37] <relipse> same with on('input' ... events
[16:21:59] <relipse> i'm modifying the dom adding more table rows and i need to add .change events to those too
[16:22:11] <shoky> .off is the opposite of .oon
[16:22:13] <shoky> .on
[16:22:16] <relipse> ok thanks
[16:22:17] <hugo_moss> will i be able to add multiple $(window).load, like document.ready by queuing it up
[16:22:28] <shoky> hugo_moss: ya i think so
[16:22:29] <hugo_moss> can i somehow use .on with onload
[16:23:24] <hugo_moss> hmm na it seems its overriding the other one
[16:29:13] <hugo_moss> what about addEventListener
[16:29:14] <hugo_moss> for load
[16:40:20] <relipse> i saw this on stackoverflow, what is the purpose:     document.write("\<script src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js' type='text/javascript'>\<\/script>");
[16:40:31] <relipse> why not just include it with a <script src
[16:43:58] <SDr> relipse, bots without JS capacity will not load that script I guess...
[16:46:58] <relipse2> rgg
[17:21:07] <relipse2> how do i break out of a .each() ?
[17:21:13] <relipse2> and return a value
[17:30:25] <shoky> what do you mean.. return a value?
[17:30:35] <shoky> a loop doesn't have a value
[17:30:51] <shoky> you break by returning false
[17:32:47] <LoneSoldier728> shoky backbone?
[17:32:52] <LoneSoldier728> any clue on it?
[17:34:03] <shoky> LoneSoldier728: not much
[17:34:13] <LoneSoldier728> i am trying to remove a view
[17:34:17] <LoneSoldier728> and bring a new one
[17:34:23] <LoneSoldier728> trying to figure out how to do that exactly
[17:34:32] <LoneSoldier728> like if I can remove the view within the view itself
[17:34:35] <shoky> dunno
[17:34:59] <LoneSoldier728> I am really having a this problem
[17:35:17] <LoneSoldier728> because I cannot call this.remove and I cant do var that = this without an error
[18:11:51] <Rohan_Bhangui>  guys
[18:11:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> when the orientaion of devices changes
[18:12:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> does window.resize get triggereD?
[18:12:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> $(window).on("resize"......
[18:12:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is
[19:02:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> any one know any good media quires for tablets
[19:02:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> and smart phones
[19:03:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> all portrait tablets and all landscape and portrait smart phones
[19:03:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> in 1 query
[19:03:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> and all landscape talbets in another
[19:09:52] <pixelpimp> lol
[19:10:01] <pixelpimp> i think that's a very tall order
[19:10:20] <pixelpimp> you can easily select landscape/portrait
[19:32:05] <Ericx2x> Is there a way you can do something like this
[19:32:05] <Ericx2x> if ($.browser.webkit) {
[19:32:09] <Ericx2x> without it being both Safari CSS and Webkit Google Chrome
[19:32:18] <Ericx2x> a way to only isolate safari?
[19:36:04] <pixelpimp> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5899783/detect-safari-using-jquery
[19:36:30] <Ericx2x> I'm reading that
[19:36:36] <Ericx2x> but it's not working =\
[19:37:03] <pixelpimp> :(
[19:38:48] <Ericx2x> Is the top answer javascript or jquery?
[19:39:11] <Ericx2x> i get the alert working but i cant use css on the top answer
[19:39:56] <systemfault> Ericx2x: What's up with safari?
[19:40:31] <Ericx2x> nice i got it working
[19:40:38] <Ericx2x> i guess you cant put jquery inside javascript
[19:40:51] <jedimind> ....
[19:40:56] <jedimind> what?
[19:41:08] <systemfault> Ericx2x: jQuery _is_ javascript bro...
[19:41:20] <Ericx2x> document.getElementById('element').style.display = 'none';
[19:41:22] <Ericx2x> $("#imgbutton").hide;
[19:41:28] <Ericx2x> i had the above two in the same location
[19:41:32] <Ericx2x> the bottom one didnt work
[19:41:35] <Ericx2x> the above one did
[19:41:39] <pixelpimp> they are very different lines
[19:41:46] <systemfault> hide is a function :/
[19:41:53] <Ericx2x> oh
[19:41:55] <pixelpimp> ^- that, plus the id's don't match
[19:41:58] <Ericx2x> i forgot the ()
[20:20:15] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19472777/clear-localstorage-and-change-the-view-backbone
[20:20:28] <LoneSoldier728> anyone able to answer that, i tried to do a bunch of research but having trouble
[20:20:32] <LoneSoldier728> it does involve backbone
[20:41:10] <erisco> if I have a popup how can I style it like a dialog?
[20:41:57] <erisco> they show such a thing on this page but offer no explanation http://api.jquerymobile.com/popup/
[20:46:43] <erisco> this page says "place standard dialog markup in a popup" ... again does not style when I try it http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/demos/widgets/popup/
[22:07:27] <Mandy_M> can Blob be dangerous?
[22:07:32] <Mandy_M> as long as it doesn't saves on the server?
[22:07:37] <Mandy_M> its just on the user side right?
[22:07:47] <Mandy_M> html5 is dead so I'm asking here
[22:08:47] <abjorn> rip #html5
[22:09:18] <abjorn> Also I don't see why Blob, in and of itself, would be dangerous.
[22:09:56] <abjorn> It's a client side construct, it doesn't save anything, and it's immutable so
[22:11:25] <abjorn> it's kind of a simpler version of Node.js's buffers
[22:12:10] <Mandy_M> mmm so it will be completely safe
[22:14:46] <abjorn> as much as anything is safe, I guess?
[22:17:51] <benkaiser> hey dabear, up for some more Google Play Hacking? I want to scrub around the song by triggering some javascript click event along the track progress slider.
[22:21:42] <benkaiser> anyone else got Google Play Music and know how to trigger a 'click' event at some point along the slider with jQuery or just javascript?
[22:25:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: just saw your reply
[22:26:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: ist here an accurate way to createa media query for all landscape tablets
[22:34:09] <benkaiser> Anyone here have Google Play Music? I am trying to scrub through a song using only a call from javascript (with or without jQuery)

[23:43:21] <tieTYT> I want to make fadetoggle go indefinitely.  What's the best way to do this?
[23:52:51] <kilian123> what is the nicest way to request a form from the server? using just information about the required fields or just html?
[23:54:35] <andryanmiller> Are you sending form data to the server?
[23:54:54] <kilian123> i want to request the form on demand and then send the form data to the server using ajax
[23:55:42] <andryanmiller> Right. So you'll serve the form using standard HTML then either use the standard <form> POST action or submit the details manually using $.ajax.
[23:56:04] <kilian123> yes
[23:56:28] <kilian123> but i ask myself if its better to just request field data like "field[]=textarea&name=textname" or just as html
