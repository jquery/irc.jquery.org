[00:01:02] <rainabba> ross`: Better still, build a validateFields() function, call it from change() event, then inside that, run your logic and set classes accordingly.
[00:01:06] <rainabba> Night all
[00:12:50] <fn> i've got a int value (222.12) and define this (for myself) as seconds. i will format it like this: mm:ss:cc (cc stands for 1/10 second)
[00:13:16] <fn> is it possible now to count from 00:00:00 to 03:42:12 in ~5seconds?
[00:13:36] <fn> may you can take this as an example, but i dont' now how to: http://www.upc-cablecom.ch/de/internet/schnelles-internet/wie-schnell-ist-blitzschnell/
[00:24:39] <Cork> fn: what exactly do you mean by "<fn> is it possible now to count from 00:00:00 to 03:42:12 in ~5seconds?" ?
[00:24:55] <fn> i will count up
[00:25:01] <fn> from 0 seconds to 222seconds
[00:25:22] <Cork> fn: i would suggest basing it on Date
[00:25:23] <fn> but not in 222seconds but in ~5seconds
[00:25:40] <fn> did you saw the link?
[00:25:53] <fn> if you change the file size, watch on the time (right site)
[00:25:58] <Cork> then you just have to do oldDateObject.setSecond(oldDateObject.getSecond() + time different)
[00:26:47] <Cork> fn: the date object doesn't have to mean it is about real time
[00:27:10] <Cork> it is just a convenient way to handle the 60 divition and things like that
[00:28:38] <fn> is there no plugin or anything else?
[00:28:49] <fn> i have no idea how it should work -.-
[00:28:57] <Cork> a plugin for what?
[00:29:13] <Cork> calculating the time is just the date object
[00:29:18] <Cork> you don̈́'t need anything else
[00:29:41] <Cork> to show it is just concuting the string
[00:29:50] <Cork> +s
[00:37:05] <fn> Cork: what i want is to animate/count from 00:00:00 to 03:22:10
[00:37:14] <fn> but not to count each second 1 second more
[00:37:32] <fn> i would like to count each 1/10 second 5/10 second up
[00:37:33] <Cork> fn: then how do you want to "animate" the text?
[00:37:56] <titii> Who have any idea how to solve not displayed characters (Google Fonts )because of roman diacritics characters in mobile devices? Is possible to make that characters Arial, but visible? Windows 7 can display it with the next of font-family, mobile not. How to solve? Any Idea? But no changing font :) Thanks
[00:38:04] <Cork> fn: so have a requestAnimationFrame or setTimeout where you do the loop and change the date value
[00:41:03] <raj> is there a cleaner way to write this? http://paste.ofcode.org/39nymHqmAEbUCEGRAzAVrxx
[00:41:41] <raj> the .replaceWith($new.fadeIn(500)) really bothers me
[00:41:58] <Cork> nope
[00:42:33] <raj> rats
[00:45:13] <fn> Cork: what was the function to put a int value (seconds) to a date format? ^^
[00:45:57] <xec> new Date() ?
[00:47:59] <Cork> fn: what do you mean by int
[00:48:03] <Cork> number?
[00:48:15] <fn> yes
[00:48:17] <Cork> or are you refering to c (int) ?
[00:48:33] <fn> got a value (int) -> 123.45
[00:48:40] <Cork> that's not an int :)
[00:48:45] <Cork> if anything it's a float
[00:49:17] <Cork> but as js only cares about numbers it doesn't matter
[00:49:35] <Cork> (all numbers in js is double floats)
[00:50:03] <Cork> fn: then yes you cant a new date object, and then base it from that
[00:50:44] <fn> ^cant?
[00:51:50] <Cork> uh... lol
[00:51:53] <Cork> *want
[00:52:06] <Cork> not sure where c came from there
[00:53:24] <fn> :D
[00:53:33] <fn> i test it
[00:55:36] <raj> Cork, how do I usee 'effect' to transition things in?
[00:55:43] <raj> it seems to only make things disappear
[00:55:59] <Cork> raj: effect isn't for transition
[00:56:08] <Palanivel> IS any any possible to trigger space bar button without keyboard action. I have tried a-lot but I could not find it. Can you please share if you know
[00:56:14] <raj> what's it for?
[00:56:41] <Cork> raj: doing effect animation on an element, like "wiggle" "bounce" and things like that
[00:56:57] <raj> even still, it makes it disappear
[00:59:32] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to implement a countfdown function with a click function, but it not works. Separatly yes, but joined no. Anyone can help me?
[00:59:54] <raj> Cork, what's wrong with using it to make content disappear?
[01:00:05] <raj> ...thing is, I'd also like to make things reappear
[01:00:41] <Cork> raj: cause as far as i know it is meant to be used for circular animations
[01:01:28] <raj> oh, I see, they have options
[01:01:38] <Palanivel> @Cork can you tell is this possible ?
[01:02:05] <Cork> Palanivel: any any possible?
[01:02:42] <Palanivel> @Cork: Is Possible or not?
[01:02:49] <Cork> Palanivel: don't think you can fake user key inputs
[01:02:49] <abailarri> if anyone can help me, this is the code: http://pastebin.com/LjTJRMbQ
[01:03:07] <Cork> Palanivel: you can fake trigger js key events, but the browser default events won't fire from that
[01:04:09] <Cork> abailarri: try make a working jdfiddle.net about the problem
[01:04:14] <Palanivel> Ok fine How to make trigger fake events
[01:05:00] <Cork> Palanivel: $('target-element').trigger('keyup') for example
[01:05:10] <Cork> or keydown if you want to trigger that event
[01:05:25] <Palanivel> Ok fine I'll try
[01:14:58] <abailarri> Cork: I created it http://jsfiddle.net/abailarri/u3A2E/2/, but I need to load a js file and I don't know how to do
[01:15:16] <Cork> abailarri: resources on the left
[01:15:28] <Cork> you need a link to the js file though
[01:30:35] <beachandbytes> is it normal for .ui-widget-header to be styled but the chrome user style sheet
[01:30:42] <beachandbytes> or am I getting some kind of weirdness
[01:33:48] <abailarri> Cork: finished http://jsfiddle.net/abailarri/u3A2E/3/
[01:34:15] <abailarri> How you can see, the countdown function not works inside the click function
[01:34:30] <abailarri> but it if is separated, yes
[01:36:14] <raj> what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/bjw6P/
[01:38:10] <seutje> raj: you can't animate from position: static to position: absolute
[01:38:59] <seutje> raj: gotta set the position value beforehand: http://jsfiddle.net/bjw6P/2/
[01:49:32] <raj> thank you seutje
[01:49:33] <raj> :)
[01:52:05] <xec> beachandbytes: "but"?
[01:52:47] <xec> beachandbytes: if you meant "by", then i guess it depends on what type of element it is? a h1 is going to have some default styles, for instance
[01:53:16] <xec> (regardless of the class applied to it)
[02:15:01] <fn> Cork: are there any probs with using setInterval during jquery.each() ?
[02:15:48] <Cork> fn: depends on what you want to do
[02:16:17] <Cork> fn: if you set them in the loop and want the delayed from each other then ya that won't work
[02:16:44] <imgrey> hello #jquery
[02:16:53] <imgrey> why bloody IE10 do not perform RPC calls ?
[02:16:58] <fn> Cork: no delay
[02:16:59] <fn> http://pastie.org/private/0u6h2yson9pezuikrxs7fa
[02:17:10] <fn> div.time should be updated every 1ms, but doesn't work
[02:17:29] <beachandbytes> xec , sorry for the slow response, I was specifcally talking about .ui-widget-header class
[02:17:41] <Cork> fn: setInterval doesn't work like that
[02:17:48] <fn> Cork: oh
[02:17:51] <fn> what should i do?
[02:17:54] <Cork> fn: also note setInterval is most likely not what you want
[02:18:03] <Cork> fn: well it expects a function reference
[02:18:04] <beachandbytes> xec, I can't figure out why chrome is styling that class on one of my profiles
[02:18:11] <fn> can you repeat it pls? ):
[02:18:13] <Cork> not the result from the function you want to run
[02:18:48] <Cork> fn: setTimeout takes a reference to a function (without the () after the function name)
[02:18:54] <lundy> could someone point me in the right direction here.. im getting this http://jsfiddle.net/VnZr7/
[02:18:59] <lundy> when trying to l
[02:18:59] <Cork> fn: and when the timer triggers it calls the function
[02:19:07] <lundy> wen trying to use jwplayer
[02:19:27] <lundy> Jplayer* .... dunno where im going wrong
[02:19:46] <fn> Cork: doesn't understand what are you telling me
[02:19:57] <Cork> fn: setInterval is scary casue it can get time skew cause it doens't depend on how long the js takes to run
[02:20:11] <Cork> fn: also you don't know when it will fire, just an aprox value
[02:20:41] <Cork> fn: so you need to use the current time stamp to get a correct reference to how long its been (the count isn't enough)
[02:21:01] <fn> for what does i need the current time stamp?
[02:21:12] <fn> i know how long the duration is (123.45 as example)
[02:21:24] <fn> and then i will count from 0 to 123.45
[02:21:31] <fn> every step in 1ms
[02:21:41] <Cork> you won't ever get one call every 1ms
[02:21:49] <Cork> it will be between 9ms and 500ms
[02:21:58] <Cork> and you don't know witch one it is
[02:22:15] <Cork> THAT is why you need to use the date object to know how much time has elapsed
[02:22:24] <fn> that's not important when it jumps from 1 to 2
[02:22:54] <Cork> so if you for a while counts ~ 150 in a second and the next counts 2 is ok?
[02:23:13] <Cork> that would result in a very jerky animation
[02:23:18] <fn> this is it, what it does, when i use setInterval?
[02:23:40] <Cork> yes and setTimeout too
[02:24:21] <Cork> abailarri: the countdown lib is still missing
[02:24:31] <lundy> anyone able to help? http://jsfiddle.net/VnZr7/
[02:24:31] <abailarri> Cork: I solved it
[02:24:56] <Cork> lundy: so you have't loaded the plugin for jPlayerInspector
[02:25:59] <fn> Cork: is it a possible to use counter = setInterval(timer(obj,duration),1); in .each()?
[02:26:05] <fn> cuz of overwriting'
[02:26:54] <Cork> fn: no
[02:27:06] <Cork> counter would be the handler of the setInterval timer
[02:27:26] <Cork> abailarri: sorry for the delay, got busy
[02:29:22] <lundy> Cork, the thing is iv got jplayer.min.js loaded :/
[02:30:05] <Cork> lundy: so they might have that function split into it's own lib
[02:30:24] <lundy> Cork, im using their example :/
[02:30:41] <Cork> lundy: then you would have to contact them
[02:30:54] <dwt> Hi there, can someone tell me if I'm having a memory leak when I register a handler on some dom node, then remove it with detach() and subsequently loose all references to it?
[02:30:55] <Cork> lundy: the error means the function isn't there so you can't call it
[02:31:35] <imgrey> Anybody knows why this code not get executed in BLOODY IE10:  http://pastie.org/8316374 ?
[02:31:36] <Cork> dwt: to some degree most likely
[02:31:50] <imgrey> works everywhere else, but not in crazy IE
[02:31:59] <Cork> dwt: as jquery won't have any info about remove _data() information for example
[02:32:09] <dwt> Cork: Can you point me to somewhere where I can find more info about this?
[02:32:15] <Cork> no
[02:33:43] <dwt> Hm…. So here's my dilemma
[02:33:54] <dwt> I want to implement a more generic subview handling that does well with the dom
[02:34:11] <dwt> and thus I would like to detach() subview dom nodes from the parent
[02:34:15] <dwt> before rerendering it
[02:34:17] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/?a=register
[02:34:31] <ross`> can someone tell me why .addClass isn't working when you type in the username field
[02:34:32] <Cork> dwt: why detach()?
[02:34:35] <seutje> imgrey: $.browser is deprecated
[02:34:42] <Cork> why not just hide() the section?
[02:34:46] <dwt> So they retain their event handlers and need not rerender themselves
[02:34:57] <dwt> but when I do that, and they are subsequently not needed anymore, the detached dom nodes would go out of scope
[02:35:08] <imgrey> seutje: nevertheless it works
[02:35:16] <imgrey> what doesnt work is ajax call
[02:35:21] <Cork> dwt: so leave them and just hide the section
[02:35:21] <dwt> and thus jquery would not know to delete it's stored data (that presumeably has references to my code objects
[02:35:22] <imgrey> I have IE
[02:35:36] <imgrey> HATE
[02:35:38] <Cork> dwt: display: none; section isn't rendered
[02:36:13] <Cork> imgrey: why you hate a browser is most likely cause you isn't following the standard, and just "it works" things
[02:36:31] <Cork> ie9 has a few quirks, but even that is fairly mild
[02:36:45] <dwt> Cork: That doesn't work for us, because we want to get rid of the whole parent dom node, and recreate it,
[02:36:49] <Cork> ie10 isn't really a problem to support as long as you keep to standards all browsers support
[02:36:49] <imgrey> Cork: All browsers "just work"
[02:36:49] <dwt> but retain some of the subnodes
[02:36:55] <Cork> imgrey: no they don't
[02:36:56] <imgrey> Fuck standards of Microsoft
[02:37:03] <seutje> lol
[02:37:03] <imgrey> they always had their own standards
[02:37:11] <seutje> without them, there would be no ajax
[02:37:13] <Cork> imgrey: not since ie9
[02:37:14] <ross`> can someone help me please :O
[02:37:24] <Cork> or svg
[02:37:25] <Cork> or...
[02:37:29] <imgrey> so what standard I violated ?
[02:37:34] <imgrey> for god sake..
[02:37:44] <Cork> imgrey: you should not go for "this works"
[02:37:55] <Cork> you should go for "does this follow the specs"
[02:38:09] <Cork> and if it breaks, then yes you can complain and bang at the browsers
[02:38:15] <Cork> and yes you might have to add small hacks
[02:38:16] <imgrey> Cork: ok, you are idiot.
[02:38:19] <imgrey> Im leaving
[02:38:21] <seutje> imgrey: should prolly call() on the callback instead of just calling it like that, but I doubt that would cause any problems, as you said the ajax request doesn't even fire
[02:38:24] <seutje> lol
[02:38:25] <Cork> O_o
[02:38:38] <ross`> help me now ^>^
[02:38:38] <seutje> well that takes care of that angry dude
[02:38:55] <ross`> why isn't my .addClass working
[02:39:37] <jallardice> ross`: you mean this one? `$('#register_username_field').addClass('field_valid');`?
[02:39:44] <ross`> ya
[02:40:52] <jallardice> it is working. inspect the element in your browser dev tools.
[02:40:58] <ross`> o.O
[02:40:59] <jonkristian_wrk> This drag thing on the numbers are really cool, do you guys know what it is? http://standtomake.com/
[02:41:03] <ross`> it's not working for me
[02:41:03] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to show a div in a function wth the .show action, but it not works. Anyone can help me? This is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/abailarri/u3A2E/10/
[02:41:13] <ross`> it is changing the color for you?
[02:41:17] <ross`> i'm using firefox by the way
[02:41:27] <jallardice> ross`: it doesn't change the way the field looks because your CSS is wrong. the `.dform input[type="text"]
[02:41:37] <jallardice> rule is overriding the invalid field rule
[02:41:37] <ross`> oh it is working
[02:41:40] <ross`> why is it crossed out though
[02:41:42] <ross`> in firefx
[02:41:50] <ross`> ahhhh
[02:42:13] <ross`> does the field_valid class need to be at the end of my css file
[02:42:20] <ross`> or is it overwriting it because it is more specific?
[02:42:21] <ross`> or what
[02:43:30] <ross`> how do i make field_valid and field_invalid overwrite the other one
[02:43:31] <ross`> :O
[02:43:45] <seutje> ?g css specificity
[02:43:46] <b-ot> seutje: CSS Specificity: Things You Should Know | Smashing Coding → http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/
[02:44:46] <seutje> ross`: read that article and you will be lord of the stylesheets
[02:46:53] <ross`> how do i make it work then
[02:46:56] <bobdobbs`> Hey guys. I just took a stab at concatenating my scripts: In one file I put a minified version of jquery first, followed by a plugin, followed by my own functions wrapped inside a document.ready function. Of course, this didn't work. My functions couldn't access a function offered by a plugin.
[02:46:56] <ross`> this didn't
[02:47:14] <ross`> .field_valid input[type="text"], .field_valid input[type="password"] {
[02:47:32] <bobdobbs`> Can anyone point me to a resource that instructs me on how to do this properly?
[02:47:39] <ross`> how can i be specific both times :(
[02:47:41] <ross`> this is really annoying
[02:47:44] <ross`> i need to be specific the first time
[02:47:45] <ross`> =/
[02:47:46] <seutje> ross`: either you read at light speeds or you didn't bother
[02:47:52] <ross`> i read some of it
[02:48:16] <ross`> i tried to make it at the same level of specificity
[02:48:50] <ross`> this is why i was doing .css instead of .addClass
[02:48:51] <ross`> =/
[02:49:45] <ross`> i don't want the background of [type="submit"] to be grey
[02:50:01] <ross`> shuold i just use a second class to begin with..? hmm
[02:50:48] <seutje> sure, as long as you don't actually read the article explaining it in full detail, you should be good
[02:51:09] <ross`> i read about 60 lines of it
[02:51:49] <seutje> getting dangerously close to a useful portion, be careful now
[02:52:32] <ross`> i don't want to have to add class="grey" to every <input in the html
[02:52:39] <ross`> this is ridiculus
[02:52:45] <seutje> it sure is
[02:53:11] <ross`> can you tell me which part i should read
[02:53:14] <ross`> cause i've scanned it over
[02:53:19] <ross`> and read a good portion
[02:53:35] <seutje> it's like the ostrich, knowing the food is in a bush, yet it buries its head in the ground
[02:55:21] <ross`> i've read this page and i think i'm stupid because i can't figure out how to do this without not putting background color in [type="text"] etc OR using an id
[02:55:31] <ross`> i read about how it weights it in the binary format
[02:55:34] <ross`> can you please give me a hint
[02:55:44] <ross`> what simple point am i missin ghere
[02:56:36] <ross`> what is the best way to have in both cases formatting it to a .class then attribute
[02:56:44] <ross`> without adding a class in the html
[02:56:47] <ross`> which overrides it
[02:57:15] <ross`> please help me
[02:58:48] <jonkristian_wrk> Yay for me! Found it:) http://radagaisus.github.io/verdict/
[02:59:01] <ross`> dform .field_valid input[type="text"], .dform .field_valid input[type="password"] {
[02:59:05] <ross`> this isn't overriding it either
[02:59:22] <ross`> there is a period at the beginning
[02:59:53] <ross`> seutje: do you know how to fix this without doing unnecessary additions to the html
[03:00:28] <softmanpetro> I have a document ready $("textarea.class").live("click", function (){... In IE it works every time I click in the textarea but in Firefox only once ! Any ideea why ?
[03:00:30] <seutje> sure
[03:01:17] <softmanpetro> thx seutje
[03:01:24] <seutje> ross`:  .dform input[type="text"].field_valid, .dform input[type="password"].field_valid
[03:01:36] <seutje> the input has the class, not its parent
[03:01:38] <ross`> thank you, i didn't know you could add classes after attributes
[03:01:51] <seutje> you can put it before, doesn't matter
[03:01:51] <Cork> softmanpetro: .live is depricated move over to one of the replacement functions
[03:02:15] <softmanpetro> ok let me check if is on...
[03:02:15] <seutje> ross`:  .dform input.field_valid[type="text"], .dform input.field_valid[type="password"] works just the same
[03:03:31] <ross`> seutje: and i did read that page and try to figure it out for myself
[03:03:42] <ross`> i was lacking elementary css knowledge that wasn't shown there
[03:03:47] <seutje> ross`: only reason you need the attribute is cause you need to trump the specificity of the other selector, but since attribute selectors are equal to class selectors in specificity, you could just drop the attribute selector and simply make sure this one is last
[03:03:50] <seutje> but
[03:04:03] <seutje> then  you are effectively targetting more elements than you might want to
[03:04:04] <abailarri> Anyone has implemented various jquery countdowns?
[03:04:23] <ross`> seutje: it worked!
[03:04:28] <seutje> although I suppose you could assume the "field_valid" class won't be applied to anything that isn't a field...
[03:05:40] <seutje> ross`: well, most articles regarding specificity fail to address attribute selectors and pseudo classes, and this one does
[03:08:40] <softmanpetro> Cork is same with $(document).on("click", "textarea.class", function() { $("textarea.class").text(''); ... In IE every time I paste something in the TA will erase the previous content, in firefox it happens once... first time
[03:11:11] <jonkristian_wrk> Anyone know if an equivalent to tangle exist for jquery that is more up to date? http://worrydream.com/Tangle/
[03:11:32] <ross`> seutje: dform input[type"text"].block, .dform input[type="password"].block, .dform input[type="submit"].block { display:block;	
[03:11:39] <ross`> }i can't figure out why that isn't working
[03:11:44] <ross`> .dform .block doesn't work either
[03:12:08] <Cork> softmanpetro: use val() for form fields
[03:12:25] <softmanpetro> $(document).on("click", "textarea.class", function() { $("textarea.class").text(''); ... In IE every time I paste something in the textarea will erase the previous content, in firefox it happens once... first time
[03:12:32] <Cork> won't make a problem difference though
[03:12:48] <ross`> seutje: i add it with: $('#register_vemail').addClass('block');
[03:12:48] <softmanpetro> ok Cork let me check
[03:12:52] <ross`> do i need to be more specific in that part
[03:13:00] <Cork> softmanpetro: so you get click on paste or what?
[03:14:18] <softmanpetro> with val() works as expected Cork. Thank you
[03:14:32] <ross`> i tried doing: $('#register_vemail').addClass('.dform input[type="text"].block');
[03:14:35] <ross`> that didn't work eiher
[03:15:01] <xqo> hey, can I store variables inbetween pageloads, somehow? I have a button that links to a python-function, which returns to referer (effectively reloading the page), and I want to store a variable from before the refresh until after. what can I do?
[03:15:08] <Cork> ross`: that is a selector not a class
[03:15:21] <ross`> Cork: ?
[03:15:29] <Cork> 'this is a list of classes'
[03:15:45] <ross`> i want to add .dform input[type"text"].block, .dform input[type="password"].block, .dform input[type="submit"].block { display:block;	
[03:15:50] <ross`> }to it
[03:15:50] <Cork> '[this=is].a.selector:for-something'
[03:15:59] <ross`> how do i add .block then
[03:16:00] <ross`> to this
[03:16:04] <Cork> 'block'
[03:16:20] <ross`> oh wait...
[03:17:21] <Anes> hi friends
[03:17:24] <Anes> 1 doubt
[03:17:44] <Anes> i have a jquery - ajax return data
[03:18:15] <Anes> i need to filter the return data from some HTML tags
[03:18:23] <Anes> any one help pls?
[03:18:34] <Cork> Anes: parse the html, and use jquery to filter it
[03:18:59] <Cork> var dom = $(html); dom.find('.remove-me').remove(); $(target).append(dom);
[03:19:18] <Anes> cork: var url = "http://localhost/wp-oscar/xyz.php"; var html = $.ajax({          url: url,          cache: false,          async: false,          dataType: "html"          }).responseText;
[03:19:27] <bobdobbs`> yikes
[03:19:36] <Cork> Anes: never do sync ajax calls
[03:19:41] <Cork> ever
[03:19:54] <Cork> (well except if you need to call it in unload)
[03:19:58] <Anes> cork;bob:  means?
[03:20:07] <Cork> Anes: use the success callback
[03:20:12] <Anes> ok
[03:20:13] <Cork> and keep ajax async
[03:20:19] <bobdobbs`> Anes: means use a pastebin
[03:20:21] <Cork> meaning you can't return the data
[03:20:31] <Anes> cork : ok dear
[03:20:32] <Cork> and ya, don't paste the code in the channel
[03:20:58] <Cork> Anes: for one sync ajax is for legacy support, it isn't developed
[03:21:10] <Cork> and NONE of the new features that comes to ajax will exist for sync calls
[03:21:23] <Anes> Cork: pls help to how to remove <meta ......>  elements from returned data here?
[03:21:38] <Cork> Anes: and sync has a lot of really bad effects on browsers,  as it actually locks them until a response comes
[03:21:59] <Cork> Anes: meta isn't valid in the content from an ajax call
[03:22:10] <Anes> Cork: ok dear
[03:22:19] <Cork> as the only thing you can have use for in ajax response is inside the body part
[03:22:36] <Anes> Cork: but i need to remove such elements
[03:22:37] <Cork> as to have any use for it it needs to be appended to the page
[03:22:41] <Cork> and that means inside body
[03:22:52] <Cork> var body = $(html).find('body')
[03:23:10] <Cork> actually that won't work either
[03:23:16] <Anes> Cork: then?
[03:23:19] <Cork> var body = $(html).find('body').html()
[03:23:40] <Cork> Anes: but honestly fix your server side
[03:23:52] <Cork> you shouldn't send full html pages to ajax requests
[03:24:04] <Anes> Cork: the data from wordpress dear
[03:24:10] <Cork> Anes: so?
[03:24:19] <Anes> Cork:so cannot remove that
[03:24:24] <Cork> sure you can
[03:25:33] <Anes> Cork: so cannot filter out that from Ajax side?
[03:26:01] <Cork> Anes: you can but it is a waist to send a full page when all you want is a small part of it
[03:26:26] <Cork> var body = $(html).find('body').html() would give you what is inside body
[03:26:39] <Cork> and that would remove everything in head
[03:27:55] <Anes> Cork: Thanks DEAR
[03:34:37] <Cork> WTF...
[03:34:56] <Cork> WHO in there right mind defined 30k local variable names in a function?!?
[03:41:56] <Syrit> Guys, i am adding checkboxes using jQuery, i would like each checkbox to have "contact_ids" as a name, (to be able to parse it from params in my controller) , how can i do that ?
[03:42:58] <Anes> Cork : Still no solution
[03:43:06] <Anes> Cork: $.ajax({          url: url,           dataType: "html",          type: 'POST',           //data: "name="+value,           success: function(data){  		    alert($(data).filter('svg').html());             $("#content").html($(data).filter('svg').html());           }       });		
[03:43:16] <Cork> Anes: please don't dump code in the channel
[03:43:24] <Anes> Cork: ok sorry
[03:43:24] <Cork> Anes: use jsfiddle.net
[03:43:54] <Anes> cork: k
[03:44:06] <Syrit> Cork why not use gist.github?
[03:44:19] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/assets/js/register.js
[03:44:22] <Cork> cause that would not be updatable, or runnable
[03:44:27] <ross`> did i put $.ajaxSetup in the right place
[03:44:31] <Cork> both is possible in jsfiddle.net
[03:44:34] <ross`> or should it go inside $(function()
[03:46:00] <Anes> Cork: for me it's not work, becoz i am working localhost
[03:46:52] <fgfdg> I am unable to submit the form? Execution goes in this function. what could be the issue? http://bpaste.net/show/vVdHHkoTeAS3Zsj792zQ/
[03:47:24] <pepijndevos> How do I get the decoded body of a non-200 json response?
[03:50:58] <Cork> fgfdg: don't use inline event attributes
[03:51:12] <Cork> fgfdg: this doens't exist in the function so you can't reference it
[03:51:18] <pepijndevos> for example, when I get a 404, the success callback is not called, but I still want to get the json object returned
[03:51:48] <Cork> fgfdg: do something like $('#id-of-button').click(newlyAdded); instead
[03:51:58] <mvk> i'm doing a $.ajax() post request to a url, after succes, i do get a 'object' back with what is looking like a json object (what im intending to do)
[03:52:12] <Cork> peper: jquery doesn't parse none 200 responses by default
[03:52:15] <Cork> *pepijndevos:
[03:52:28] <Cork> pepijndevos: so do $.parseJSON(responseText)
[03:52:28] <mvk> i can see keys and value's in this object that is given to succes:function(data)
[03:52:34] <fgfdg> Cork: will use getElementById. and i will keep in mind your the inline event advice
[03:52:44] <pepijndevos> Cork, , ok, will try
[03:52:54] <mvk> when i try to get the value, i use data.myPropertyname in javascript, but thats 'undefined'
[03:53:16] <fgfdg> thanks
[03:53:23] <Cork> myk: is the server setting the correct mimetype?
[03:53:31] <Cork> application/json ?
[03:53:44] <mvk> i dont think so!
[03:53:50] <Cork> there you go
[03:53:58] <Cork> you get a string not json then
[03:54:29] <Cork> ex in php you can do <?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); ?>
[03:55:44] <mvk> Cork: thank you very much
[03:55:49] <mvk> that brought me back in the right direction
[03:59:03] <internetbird> hello everyone. I have a small issue with jquery...
[03:59:18] <internetbird> I am working on the following piece of code:
[03:59:26] <internetbird> for (var i = 1; i <= numOfTicks; i++) {
[03:59:26] <internetbird>             var position = (canvas.width / numOfTicks) * i;
[03:59:26] <internetbird>             var zoomInDivHtml = "<div id='btnZoonIn" + i + "' ";
[03:59:26] <internetbird>             zoomInDivHtml += "class='timelineZoomInButton' ";
[03:59:26] <internetbird>             zoomInDivHtml += "style='left:" + (position + 120) + "px' ></div>";
[03:59:27] <internetbird>             $("#taskTimeLineZoomButtons").append(zoomInDivHtml);
[03:59:27] <internetbird>           
[03:59:28] <internetbird>         }
[03:59:56] <internetbird> sorry for how it was printed...
[04:00:31] <internetbird> I am looking to improve the jquery section. The way I am building the HTML is very ugly
[04:02:37] <Cork> internetbird: don't dump js in the channel
[04:02:43] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
[04:04:08] <_rgn> but don't use fiddle if your code isn't meant to work
[04:04:15] <_rgn> gist.github.com or similar is better
[04:04:42] <internetbird> ok sorry
[04:08:15] <Cork> _rgn: no, gist is if you want to show the code, but not get help with it
[04:08:36] <Cork> if you want to ask for ppl to help fix it use a site that lets you edit it
[04:08:45] <Cork> like jsfiddle.net, jsbin.com or similar
[04:09:39] <internetbird> I'v created a gist : https://gist.github.com/internetbird/6522143
[04:10:10] <internetbird> I will be happy if anyone has something to say about it
[04:10:54] <xec> lol
[04:11:50] <xec> internetbird: you can use .on() to attach event handlers, and .attr() to set attributes
[04:12:19] <xec> internetbird: or, .css() to set styles
[04:14:23] <xec> internetbird: $("<div">).css({ left: position + 120 }).on("click", func...);
[04:14:48] <xec> would create a new div with an inline style and a click handler
[04:15:36] <internetbird> I tried to do it but appearantly I missed something and it didn't work. I will try again . Thanks xec:
[04:17:21] <xec> internetbird: you're gonna have trouble with creating event handlers inside a for loop though - the i var is going to be a reference to the value it'll have when the loop is done
[04:18:35] <xec> internetbird: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide55
[04:21:05] <xec> internetbird: in any case, make a working demo in jsfiddle.net that demonstrates what you're trying to do
[05:17:19] <jop008> : I want it like this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-11_at_2.04.27_PM-luTNlJHd.png but in the tab on the middle there is an ugly white space between tehe elements http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-11_at_2.04.15_PM-ui7UV9ul.png I tried to reproduce with a fiddle but the fiddle looks fine http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/148/
[05:17:19] <jop008> [2:08pm] jop008: So how to debug this?
[05:20:30] <xec> jop008: is it related to the length of the text on the tab/title?
[05:27:22] <jop008> I tought so as well but I shortened the text and stays the same
[05:27:35] <jop008> maybe because it is the middle item?
[05:38:24] <SebastianT> hello
[05:39:49] <SebastianT> i have a performance issue with safari and i think IE. http://jsfiddle.net/V4bzP/6/  does anyone know how to fix this?
[05:40:35] <internetbird> :xec thanks alot for your help!
[06:09:18] <jop008> I have this page http://rental.touchingservices.nl/vw-book.htm?objectID=20025 which works fine in chrome in other browsers the nav tap navigation does nothing http://rental.touchingservices.nl/vw-book.htm?objectID=20025
[06:10:36] <jop008> so how to debug this no error message is thrown
[06:26:44] <jonkristian_wrk> I am trying to search genres but can't seem to return correctly, can anyone see what I am doing wrong? http://pastie.org/pastes/8316886/text
[06:29:30] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: are you sure filter expects return to be used?
[06:30:35] <Christer> Anyone got a clue as to why $('#mySelectElement option).filter(":selected") returns all the options, and not just the selected ones? (multiple select element)
[06:30:46] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, am fumbling around a little bit, I can't seem to find any examples on how to use the filter properly
[06:31:21] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, it's nested so i need to return results.tagmatches
[06:31:50] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/ ?
[06:32:25] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, I know
[06:32:35] <Cork> jonathanochs: no i meant is it that lib?
[06:32:40] <jop008> This code runs fine in Chrome  $('#barcontainer').bind('click', function(ev) {       alert ("test"); but not in other browsers
[06:32:43] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, oh, yeah it is
[06:33:05] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: then yes it expects return
[06:33:22] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: and it expects the same format you get from $.grep (it uses this one by default)
[06:33:59] <Cork> jop008: that line of code on it's own most definitely runs in all browsers
[06:34:07] <Cork> jop008: so you would have to give more context
[06:34:42] <jop008> The alert is in chrome but not in other browsers
[06:35:05] <Cork> jop008: reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[06:35:33] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, I was trying different stuff and now i get some response at least: http://pastie.org/8316909
[06:36:11] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[06:36:17] <jop008> this is the complete code http://pastebin.com/1hbUxnT0
[06:38:31] <Asmooh> isnt there a jqm package for building an ios app?
[06:38:35] <Asmooh> like bb10 has
[06:39:25] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: opps sorry i read the library wrong
[06:39:54] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: grep is something they bind to internal utils.filter not the filter option
[06:41:50] <moura> https://gist.github.com/ricardomoura/6523780
[06:42:01] <moura> that hide() doenst work why?
[06:42:24] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, I wrote my own search thing yesterday which is working, i just need to convert it to typeahead, http://pastie.org/pastes/8316931/text
[06:42:54] <Cork> moura: $(e.currentTarget).closest('ul.select-passangers') most likely doesn't match anything
[06:43:10] <moura> the console log shows the el
[06:43:14] <moura> it's there
[06:43:37] <moura> if i do html('blabla') works fine
[06:44:04] <moura> or other command. except hide and toggle
[06:44:20] <Cork> moura: then you need to make a fiddle with the html and the running js
[06:44:41] <moura> thats hard cause I'm using with backbone
[06:44:44] <moura> :\
[06:47:05] <moura> console.log($.toggle); // undefined
[06:47:06] <jop008> strange the fiddle works http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/8/
[06:47:07] <moura> what
[06:47:17] <jop008> So what can be wrong
[06:47:46] <Krisostoomus> New site up and running, tell me what U think of it(in contact information->comments): http://webchef.netau.net/
[06:48:44] <xec> Krisostoomus: beautiful!
[06:49:39] <Krisostoomus> thanks! :)
[06:50:25] <Christer> Anyone got a clue as to why $('#mySelectElement option').filter(":selected") returns all the options, and not just the selected ones? (multiple select element)
[06:51:30] <Cork> Christer: think selected checks the attribute selected
[06:51:45] <Cork> Christer: and that would mean it isn't usable here
[06:52:25] <xec> Cork, Christer: should work? check the demo at http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[06:52:54] <xec> why .filter() though?
[06:55:34] <Asmooh> interesting
[06:55:42] <Asmooh> i tought jquery mobile was all i need
[06:55:45] <SebastianT> sorry that I have to ask a second time. but it is still a problem :( i have a performance issue with safari and i think IE. http://jsfiddle.net/V4bzP/6/  does anyone know how to fix this?
[06:55:52] <Asmooh> but some things are build in jquery it self
[06:55:54] <Asmooh> others in mobile
[06:56:22] <xec> Christer: http://jsfiddle.net/nNZ2p/ seems to work
[06:56:48] <Cork> xec, Christer: http://jsfiddle.net/b4fSa/ yup works fine
[06:58:39] <Christer> yeah, it does. hmm... Im using the Chosen plugin. but according to the docs and people. That should change the value of the select element as well.
[07:00:04] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, Do you see how I can target a nested json object and return it? I think filter is not what I need, I want to return results.tagmatches.tag.
[07:00:45] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, tried wrapping results.tagmatches.tag in valueKey but that didn't work either
[07:01:01] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: are you targeting json or a javascript object?
[07:01:05] <jonkristian_wrk> json
[07:01:15] <jonkristian_wrk> http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=tag.search&tag=punk&api_key=3718dede7256c5e7b144833adc5a823d&format=json
[07:01:26] <Cork> JSON.parse(json).tagmatches.tag
[07:01:41] <jonkristian_wrk> for instance, the tag is nested in results.tagmatches.tag
[07:01:43] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: no i meant is what your working with json or a javascript object?
[07:02:02] <jop008> So for what reason can this fail   $('#barcontainer').bind('click', function(ev) {      alert ("test");
[07:02:31] <jop008> in the fiddle it goes fine http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/8/ but not in my code
[07:02:51] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: json is a string, if you have an object you can reference it
[07:03:07] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: and normally jquery converts json to js objects for you
[07:03:32] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, sorry for the wrong phrasing
[07:03:36] <Cork> jop008: cause something else in your page is doing something
[07:03:39] <jonkristian_wrk> Pretty new at this
[07:03:42] <Cork> jop008: like ex. the id doesn't exist yet
[07:03:56] <Cork> jop008: or the element is replaced between it was added and you clicked it
[07:04:26] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: if you have it as js object results.tagmatches.tag should work just fine
[07:04:32] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, the dataType is json in typeahead
[07:04:41] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: unless you have an array or something like that in there
[07:04:45] <jop008> thx
[07:05:41] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, yes results.tagmatches.tag works in my custom query, but with typeahead I can't figure out how to target results.tagmatches.tag
[07:06:16] <jonkristian_wrk> Right now it returns the entire results
[07:06:21] <jonkristian_wrk> it seems
[07:06:48] <jop008> hard to debug this one
[07:07:01] <jop008> the barcontainer is present at load
[07:11:03] <jop008> So oel = $('#barcontainer');   alert (oel);   $('#bar').navbar();   $('#barcontainer').bind('click', function(ev) { alert ("test");
[07:11:30] <NoiseEee> jop it works fine
[07:11:30] <jop008> oel is an object but the click is doing nothing in Safari
[07:11:45] <NoiseEee> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/9/
[07:11:59] <NoiseEee> jop008: don't use alert() for debugging.  please give this a read: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[07:16:00] <Christer> Cork, xec: Strange. Works here as well =/ http://jsfiddle.net/vmeS7/
[07:16:06] <Christer> With the chosen plugin.
[07:20:30] <jop008> Now have this debugger;   $('#bar').navbar();  $('#barcontainer').bind('click', function(ev) {
[07:20:39] <jop008> oel is filed but the bind is skipped
[07:20:50] <jop008> debug it step by step
[07:20:56] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, Got it working, I have no idea why it didn't work earlier... http://pastie.org/8317069
[07:21:06] <NoiseEee> jop008: update your fiddle
[07:23:37] <jop008> this is the updated fiddle
[07:23:42] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/10/
[07:24:32] <NoiseEee> jop008: and whats the issue?
[07:24:34] <jop008> but the fiddle does the alert and my code doesn't
[07:24:42] <NoiseEee> then figure out what the difference is.
[07:25:11] <d0den> I just spent *literally* an hour debugging some code because I had accidentally declared a new var instead of updating the old one
[07:25:35] <jop008> my complete code is here http://pastebin.com/1hbUxnT0
[07:25:35] <jop008> I can't see what is different
[07:25:54] <Christer> Cork, xec: got it! Another loop that was checking what the values previously were set to. selected all the values upon opening the window, something chosen didnt see. -.-
[07:26:42] <NoiseEee> well update the fiddle to use that code then jop008
[07:26:45] <jop008> So why is the bind not working in non chrome browsers?
[07:26:54] <NoiseEee> or send us  a link with that code up somewhere
[07:27:14] <jop008> But the complete code touches libraries not that easy
[07:27:29] <NoiseEee> jop008: well maybe its a library conflict.
[07:27:57] <d0den> in webchat, is there a way to turn off connection messages?
[07:27:58] <NoiseEee> use .on() instead of bind by the way
[07:27:58] <NoiseEee> but anyways, you can figure it out if you learn to debug.
[07:28:01] <NoiseEee> read that site.,
[07:28:06] <NoiseEee> d0den: depends on your client
[07:28:18] <jop008> for instance this is not working in th e fiddle   var cpathname =  $(location).attr('pathname') ;
[07:28:41] <d0den> NoiseEee I just meant using the webchat client
[07:28:57] <NoiseEee> i don't know webchat, d0den
[07:29:25] <NoiseEee> jop008: whats the error message?
[07:30:19] <NoiseEee> you can't make window.location a jquery object anyhow
[07:30:31] <NoiseEee> assuming you meant window.location
[07:31:56] <NoiseEee> but you're using your console and seeing the error message anyways, right jop008?
[07:39:23] <jop008> There is no errormessage
[07:39:33] <jop008>  on the console Noise
[07:39:59] <jop008> Otherwise I had a starting point for debugging
[07:42:33] <Bloomberg> hi guys
[07:44:36] <Bloomberg> I'm working with contextMenu and fullcalendar jquery plugin, I need to get the selector in eventClick for the right menu context
[07:44:43] <Bloomberg> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[07:44:45] <Bloomberg> http://medialize.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/
[07:44:47] <NoiseEee> funny, i had one when i entered that message in console, jop008
[07:45:08] <jop008> that message?
[07:45:23] <Bloomberg> These are the links of the plugins
[07:46:42] <NoiseEee> jop008: var cpathname =  $(location).attr('pathname') ;   //TypeError: Cannot call method 'attr' of null
[07:47:32] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/56Paf/
[07:47:37] <Bloomberg> I have this script
[07:47:56] <Bloomberg> in selector option what can I do to put?
[07:48:03] <Bloomberg> for put that event
[07:50:23] <d0den> Can jquery load variables from URL parameters? as in, something equivalent to example.com/?var=foo
[07:50:33] <NoiseEee> sure
[07:51:09] <TheGallery> Hello, can someone suggest an AJAX-PHP chat system?
[07:51:38] <jop008> in what browser was the type error?
[07:55:28] <d0den> NoiseEee, can you point me towards something that explains how to do that?
[07:56:44] <NoiseEee> jop008: chrome.
[07:56:49] <BillCriswell> TheGallery: http://socketo.me/ looks like a good start.
[07:56:52] <NoiseEee> jop you can't make window.location a jquery object anyhow
[07:56:58] <NoiseEee> jop008: you can't make window.location a jquery object anyhow
[07:57:03] <jop008> In chrome the code is working
[07:57:21] <jop008> other browsers won't
[07:57:33] <jop008> I inspected FF console but no type errors
[07:57:42] <NoiseEee> jop008: then set it to break on exceptions
[07:57:53] <NoiseEee> you have an issue with that line, at least.  location is undefined.
[07:57:58] <NoiseEee> jop008: you can't make window.location a jquery object anyhow  (for the last time)
[07:58:04] <jop008> How to do that?
[07:58:16] <jop008> I take a look at window.lo
[07:59:08] <NoiseEee> hmm i suppose you can
[08:00:20] <NoiseEee> jop008: its impossible to help you if you dont have a full fiddle working.  saying it works in the fiddle and not on your site means FIND THE DIFFERENCE or UPDATE THE FIDDLE.   i can't possibly see how line 28 would work anyways, as you don't define 'location'
[08:00:59] <jop008> alert alert (cpathname); gives me the correct value in FF
[08:01:57] <NoiseEee> jop008: whats the issue
[08:02:01] <NoiseEee> what does 'not working; mean
[08:02:19] <NoiseEee> have you gone through the site i linked?
[08:03:06] <NoiseEee> also fwiw creating a website by concat'ing strings is a terrible idea
[08:03:12] <NoiseEee> use templates for goodness sakes
[08:04:03] <d0den> believe I have answered my own question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values
[08:04:23] <jop008> Not working means I can not click on a tab in the navbar clicking doesn't switch from page
[08:04:36] <jop008> the window.location stuf in all browsers are okay
[08:05:19] <NoiseEee> jop008: and what exactly is 'isnull'?
[08:05:35] <TheGallery> BillCriswell, ty :)
[08:05:44] <jop008> Maybe this causes the trouble Ajax setup json error parsererror
[08:05:44] <jop008> Error: SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unrecognized token '<'
[08:05:44] <jop008>  url: ./index.php?-action=vw_get_activity&objectID=20025
[08:06:15] <jop008> Isnull is a small function checking for is null
[08:06:40] <jop008> function isnull (xobject) {   if(typeof(xobject) !== 'undefined' && xobject != null) {     return false;   } else {     return true;
[08:07:26] <NoiseEee> jop008: only you can debug.
[08:07:30] <NoiseEee> learn how to do it.
[08:08:14] <BillCriswell> Unscore just uses: return obj === null;
[08:08:40] <NoiseEee> (i'm a little baffled as to why he's using a function in the first place)
[08:16:24] <jop008> I develop for years and almost 10 months with jqM so I know how to debug
[08:20:55] <Bloomberg> jop008: man, can do you help me with a little thing plz?
[08:23:20] <jop008> my console is clean no error messages in safari
[08:23:33] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/56Paf/
[08:23:47] <Bloomberg> I'm trying to get the selector of that event
[08:23:53] <petey> how would i chain several div's together
[08:23:55] <petey> for example, instead of running $('html').fadeOut(), i'd like to fade out just two elements on the page
[08:23:57] <petey> do I want to do separate div.fadeout's or can i combine them
[08:24:32] <blindMoe> petey: $('#id1, #id2').fadeOut();  or give them both the same class and $('.whatever').fadeOut();
[08:25:09] <NoiseEee> $('.classOfDivsToFadeOut').fadeOut()
[08:29:28] <jop008> I am struggeling for my own thing ;-(
[08:29:49] <petey> blindMoe thankyou that is great
[08:30:37] <blindMoe> np
[08:34:13] <jop008> I do this $('#page').prepend(strVar);
[08:34:23] <jop008> with an html string
[08:34:46] <jop008> then I do a bind on my navbar can it cause timing issues?
[08:35:19] <jop008> How can I check if the bind statement was done properly ?
[08:35:35] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm using jquery.sticky.js (https://github.com/garand/sticky), however I can't get it working right. I'm using jq('.goto-top').sticky({ bottomSpacing: 292 });, but when I scroll '.goto-top' just shoots up to the top. Does anybody know how I can fix this, or can suggest a better tool?
[08:36:59] <rabbi1> hi, is there a way to find the length of a <p> tag and add a link 'read more' and with a click the link points to another page….
[08:37:04] <coldhead> lol jop008
[08:37:32] <rabbi1> similar to jquery.shorten.js but more content is not opened in the same page but different page
[08:37:32] <coldhead> can't you just trigger the event and see if the handler runs?
[08:38:10] <coldhead> rabbi1: http://plugins.learningjquery.com/expander/ etc
[08:38:22] <coldhead> oh different page?
[08:38:26] <coldhead> how's that gonna work
[08:38:34] <coldhead> it would need a different URL
[08:40:32] <rabbi1> coldhead: can load the url dynamically
[08:40:33] <rabbi1> append should do
[08:40:48] <kode101> i have a variable that is an array of 1000 image urls
[08:40:55] <kode101> how do i fade between them randomly
[08:41:06] <kode101> show one image, wait 40 seconds, show another ranomd image
[08:41:13] <kode101> endlessly
[08:41:16] <rabbi1> coldhead: expander is same as the shorten
[08:41:27] <abjorn> coldhead is a jerk
[08:41:30] <coldhead> yes i see that now
[08:41:41] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss
[08:41:54] <rabbi1> coldhead: :) chillax
[08:42:18] <coldhead> never
[08:42:41] <rabbi1> i guess this could good requirement for some one develop a now plugin
[08:42:48] <rabbi1> *new
[08:42:58] <jop008> in the debugger found the element and bind entry but I can't see the code for switching pages (which is missing indeed)
[08:43:57] <jop008> So I think something to do with timing
[08:44:58] <jop008> Is there a way to check if the bind was successful?
[08:45:04] <Bloomberg> How can I set a selector in contextmenu if the element is dynamic like fullcalendar events?
[08:45:54] <abjorn> coldhead is hopped up on all that caffeine

[08:58:42] <coldhead> rabbi1: i don't understand, rabbi1
[08:58:51] <coldhead> it sounds like you want to truncate on the server side
[08:58:58] <coldhead> i don't know, it's my first day using jquery
[08:59:27] <boytoy_> hehe
[08:59:37] <abjorn> ironically it's his first day but it's his second day at jq conf
[08:59:49] <rabbi1> coldhead: o np, thanks
[09:00:02] <coldhead> it's my first day at my second day here
[09:00:06] <boytoy_> rabbi1: what are you trying to do? i just finished my own text truncation project so
[09:00:11] <grafi> looks whos back
[09:00:15] <grafi> back again
[09:00:20] <grafi> coldheads back
[09:00:23] <grafi> x:
[09:00:24] <coldhead> welcome back grafi
[09:00:40] <boytoy_> abjorn: his?
[09:00:48] <boytoy_> rabbi1: uses ellipsis.js: http://jsfiddle.net/Wn4Ym/3/
[09:00:50] <rabbi1> boytoy_: i need to truncate a <div> have more than one <p> tag in it.. and show the "read more" link and make open in new page
[09:00:52] <abjorn> ...yes?
[09:01:07] <boytoy_> rabbi1: then you're gonna wanna check out my fiddle
[09:01:59] <abjorn> boytoy_: were you expecting coldhead to be a woman?
[09:02:02] <BillCriswell> Is there a way to programmatically generate these "numbers"? Started doing them manually cause it was kind of fun then got bored as shit.
[09:02:04] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/oVejaBU/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[09:02:11] <boytoy_> abjorn: yeah i kinda did
[09:02:50] <rabbi1> boytoy_: 'read more' opens the content in the same page ….. 'read more' will more likely to another page <a href="myproject/post/1">
[09:02:51] <abjorn> yes but he identifies as male
[09:02:54] <abjorn> he's pre-op
[09:03:32] <thrillhouse> abjorn: i identify as MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS
[09:03:50] <abjorn> i thought we were friends
[09:04:04] <thrillhouse> with benefits?
[09:04:12] <thrillhouse> I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL
[09:04:15] <boytoy_> lol
[09:04:18] <grafi> mila kunis?
[09:04:21] <grafi> oô
[09:04:23] <abjorn> that's not what i hear
[09:05:15] <boytoy_> rabbi1: so? my fiddle is awesome and u know it
[09:05:56] <coldhead> i am surprised you can hear anything through that thick mane of luxuriant hair, abjorn
[09:06:10] <abjorn> it's a gift
[09:06:29] <rabbi1> boytoy_: that doesn't serve my purpose though it's awesome.. good work :)
[09:06:45] <coldhead> your purpose is crazy, rabbsy
[09:06:47] <abjorn> good work everyone, take five
[09:07:06] <coldhead> literlol, abjsy
[09:07:08] <DeltaHeavy> I have fixed elements on my page, however I don't want them going over top of the header and footer, so I want them to stop 'x' number of pixels below or above those marks. Does anybody know how I can accomplish this? I want it to stay lets say 100px from the top of the screen (fixed position), however I don't want it to go over the header that's 400px tall.
[09:08:25] <coldhead> DeltaHeavy: html, body { overflow: hidden; }
[09:08:27] <abjorn> you'd need to calculate that in a scroll event, though there's probably plugins that do that sort of thing
[09:08:51] <abjorn> don't preempt me coldhead
[09:08:57] <DeltaHeavy> coldhead: I'm pretty sure that's not what I need. I'm thinking I'm just going to find the height of the doc and do it that way. Was hoping a library could just do it for me
[09:08:57] <abjorn> this is unacceptable
[09:09:17] <boytoy_> rabbi1: but you wanted something that checks length, it does that. you wanted something that can deal with multiple p's in a div, it does that.
[09:10:19] <boytoy_> rabbi1: your jquery shorten plugin hasnt been updated in 3 years anyway
[09:10:52] <DeltaHeavy> But how could I enforce this always without having an event almost constantly fireing?
[09:11:04] <rabbi1> boytoy_: yeap it does
[09:11:04] <rabbi1> i already got plugin for that as well.. anyway it serves half of my requirement :) …..
[09:11:04] <rabbi1> my jquery plugin ?
[09:11:08] <boytoy_> my fiddle works equally well with ellipsis.js as it does with jquery-smarttruncation. but avoid trunk8 should you ever come across that.
[09:11:17] <rabbi1> its not mine, just googling around
[09:11:38] <boytoy_> i know its not yours, was just saying
[09:11:41] <rabbi1> did u see jquery.dotdotdot
[09:11:42] <rabbi1> ?
[09:11:59] <boytoy_> nope, interesting
[09:13:18] <kode101> any ideas?
[09:13:37] <kode101> i have 1000 image urls, and want to fade thru them
[09:15:17] <grafi> oO
[09:17:04] <rabbi1> boytoy_: http://dotdotdot.frebsite.nl/ check for the 'after' parameter
[09:17:37] <rabbi1> that's close to what i need and few more additions, should be done…. no plugins available for it ….. :)
[09:21:29] <Manusoftar> i'm having some issues trying to switch between two css classes, its like it just wont aplly neither of em

[11:29:22] <jan0232> in recent query 1.10.x i find that  $(something).parents().find('.item').first()  does something different then on query 1.8.x ... somehow the order will be mixed up...
[11:29:35] <jan0232> is this a bug?
[11:31:12] <blindMoe> jan0232: would recommend showing a jsfiddle of this happening
[11:31:41] <jan0232> blindMoe: yea ok. i need to provide a simple case...it's quite hard to explain ;)
[11:32:00] <blindMoe> nah it is easy to explain but seeing it in action always helps
[11:32:12] <blindMoe> you could jsut create one example and we can switch the jquery ver
[11:32:39] <jan0232> ok cool
[11:32:40] <jan0232> hang on
[11:38:10] <jan0232> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/7GReG/   ... check with jquery 1.10.1 vs 10.83 for example...
[11:38:29] <jan0232> by the way...i know that there would be a better way to do the same thing...this is just to show the different behavior.
[11:39:14] <blindMoe> jan0232: http://jsfiddle.net/7GReG/1/
[11:39:21] <blindMoe> Why did you have .parents() and not .parent() ?
[11:39:48] <blindMoe> did you mean to use .parents() ?
[11:40:19] <jan0232> yea in the original app i'm writing the toggle link might sometimes be deeper in the tree
[11:40:50] <blindMoe> hrmm so maybe .closest() ?
[11:41:56] <jan0232> blindMoe: hard to explain, but closest is not working in my case since sometimes the event happens on the same level as the item...
[11:42:21] <blindMoe> jan0232: no static selector above the element that would contain what you are looking for?
[11:42:21] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/7GReG/2/
[11:42:31] <jan0232> anyway.. i will probably find a solution. but isn't this a bug?? that parents().find(something) does not keep the order right?
[11:42:46] <blindMoe> not sure if it is a bug or a design choice
[11:43:01] <blindMoe> I haven't seen it before and this is the first I have heard of it
[11:43:41] <jan0232> might be a design choice because first() "correctly" returns the first element that is found in the dom...
[11:44:20] <jan0232> one could argue that both cases are correct
[11:44:21] <coldhead> .parents().find() is going to run the find on EACH of the parents
[11:44:34] <coldhead> it's BUSY
[11:45:57] <jan0232> coldhead: yes, but isn't it weird that the order gets mixed up in the end? parents() returns each parent in a certain order...then find does the find on each of those...but somehow... find().first() does not return the first match...rather the first math regarding the dom
[11:46:18] <raj> jqui's .tabs() requries tab links to have href's with anchors, then I can't make the page also work without js. Correct?
[11:46:26] <coldhead> ordering is controversial
[11:46:46] <coldhead> results are supposed to be in DOM order
[11:47:36] <jan0232> coldhead: ok. i guess i built some behavior around a bug in 1.8.x then that got fixed ;)
[11:49:07] <abjorn> you should be able to use .siblings() instead of .parents().find()
[11:49:15] <abjorn> just fyi
[11:49:35] <coldhead> .parents().find() is actually going to be the same as $(), ultimately
[11:49:57] <coldhead> because html and body will be returned by parents
[11:50:05] <abjorn> I figured he was trying to search from the direct parent
[11:50:08] <coldhead> so it will end up searching the entire dom >: |
[11:50:39] <abjorn> TIL don't search the entire DOM or coldhead gets mad
[11:50:54] <coldhead> this isn't me mad, this is me bursting with urine
[11:50:57] <jan0232> basically what i wanted was: go to the parent -> find ... if nothing is found, go to next parent -> find ... etc. until something is found...
[11:51:10] <abjorn> you should probably use the bathroom
[11:51:15] <maxmoore14> anyone know when theme roller will be updated for jqm 1.4 ?
[11:51:18] <coldhead> you can't do that in one line, jan0232 :)
[11:51:21] <abjorn> ah
[11:51:28] <abjorn> yeah
[11:51:35] <abjorn> that's an odd situation
[11:51:41] <jan0232> coldhead: well, in query 1.8.3 it was .parents().find('.bla').first() :D
[11:51:55] <jan0232> probably really inefficient though :D
[11:52:16] <abjorn> I have a hard time believing that would do what you're describing in any version of jQuery
[11:52:28] <coldhead> that's bad because it depends on the order returned
[11:52:46] <coldhead> it's better to be explicit and not rely on something so slippery that can change version to version
[11:52:56] <jan0232> coldhead: ok good to know, thx
[11:53:21] <abjorn> i've been burned by depending on ordering in jquery before :(
[11:54:24] <jan0232> hm, is there something like closest(), but including siblings first?
[11:54:51] <andrew9183> would it be hard to rewrite masonry as a learning experience
[11:55:52] <abjorn> idk try it and let me know
[11:56:09] <abjorn> also i suppose it probably depends on how good you are at math
[11:57:03] <jan0232> oh wait... siblings works pretty well...
[11:57:05] <jan0232> thx
[11:57:06] <fission6> can i detect in a my window when something in a frame has been doubled clicked
[11:57:18] <fission6> i.e and image and then get its src
[11:57:24] <boolieman> so my question is somewhat simple just want to know if something is constructable in this fashion and maybe where to look for an example.  I have a backend load that passes data and depending on the data passed to it parameters deterimed in the call it can return 1 of 2 pages, is there a way to read part of the page data easily in the response call to know where to load the data to determine what page it is?
[11:58:00] <fission6> sounds like rickety archetrure / approach
[11:58:04] <andrew9183> thats a long sentence for something simple
[11:58:05] <andrew9183> lol
[11:58:35] <andrew9183> you should pass a paging parameter
[11:58:40] <boolieman> well if its editable it returns template 1 not editable template 2
[11:58:45] <fission6> boolieman: can you make two distinct services determined on the client side which to call
[11:59:12] <boolieman> i can do the backend work to be honest and dont find it that difficult lol
[11:59:14] <fission6> and why does the client side care about which is returned vs just popping it into the ODM
[12:00:08] <boolieman> both templates are different and it produces a jquery popup so i have to change popup size to keep proper formats and things like that
[12:01:06] <boolieman> so as an example if its editable i have a format to make room for text boxes etc, if its not it just shows you things, no text boxes
[12:01:54] <nhulea> is there a way to combine these into a single .each function http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/AVLgA/ it seems like I could
[12:02:45] <andrew9183> can you show an easier example, its too cluttered
[12:06:23] <raj> jqui's .tabs() requries tab links to have href's with anchors, then I can't make the page also work without js. Correct?
[12:08:39] <andrew9183> use bootstrap tabs, just sayin :)
[12:11:14] <V8Energy> does anybody know how to get which button was click when using jquery's .on('submit'...)?
[12:14:28] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: Check the events target.
[12:15:13] <BillCriswell> You know you how can pass the event object to the listener like: .on('submit', function(e){ ... }); you'd want e.target
[12:15:32] <maxmoore14> anyone know when theme roller will be updated for jqm 1.4 ?
[12:15:35] <silmarils> hello
[12:15:46] <silmarils> did someone has already use isotope filter ?
[12:17:36] <Blaster> hey does anyone know of a good image cropping library?
[12:18:15] <V8Energy> BillCriswell yeah I am looking at it right now. there's so much info there...
[12:19:03] <V8Energy> BillCriswell: event.target returns the form
[12:21:39] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: Hmm
[12:23:35] <V8Energy> i tried to find and return clicked=true element, and all i got is this mess: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d1d2cb68885e04573cd3
[12:26:04] <BillCriswell> That's weird, it seems to only be doable through click.
[12:26:46] <BillCriswell> Wonder why that is.
[12:27:28] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: http://jsbin.com/utAbUJU/1/edit this is about as close as it gets I think.
[12:27:53] <BillCriswell> The events still fire even if the keyboard is used though.
[12:28:12] <Syco54645_work> hello, not exactly jquery but jquery ui. Maybe someone here has an idea. I have this microsite thing that I made for a client. When you click Download Customer Email Template at the bottom it opens a jqueryui dialog window. For what ever reason it is automatically selecting the first link it comes to, which happens to be a button that is really just a styled anchor tag. Does anyone know how to prevent this? The url is http://msa.s
[12:28:12] <Syco54645_work> dev.pipitonegroup.com/new/
[12:28:20] <Syco54645_work> bah, the url is http://msa.sdev.pipitonegroup.com/new/
[12:30:08] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: Did you want it to focus on anything?
[12:30:27] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: nope, just wanted it to open. it looks rather silly with that automatically highlighted
[12:31:31] <Syco54645_work> i tested my theory that it was in fact focusing the first link by putting just a regular link on the main screen of the dialog and it draws the dashed line around it.
[12:31:34] <Syco54645_work> what ever you want to call that
[12:32:46] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: Everything I'm reading is just says to use blur or hide a link or input somewhere before the first one.
[12:32:53] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1202079/prevent-jquery-ui-dialog-from-setting-focus-to-first-textbox Reading here.
[12:34:18] <Corrado_> someone uses jquery plugin file? I have a problem with IE8 / 9
[12:35:26] <petey> So I've got ('html').fadeIn set on my site, but for some reason some pages render this weird white box before it hits full opacity
[12:35:34] <petey> anyone have any idea what it could be?
[12:35:45] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: thanks so much! i spent probably 20 minutes googling and couldnt find this
[12:36:03] <petey> It only happens while the opacity is changing
[12:36:32] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: Yeah. Google sometimes makes me feel like a crazy person as well.
[12:37:08] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: i am going to email that out to the department. good fix. i can say that the bug was not fixed in jquery 1.10.3 unless it is a regression bug
[12:38:03] <V8Energy> BillCriswell: my code looks like this: http://jsbin.com/utAbUJU/2/edit and it doesn't work. the reason i have to listen to $(document)  is because the form is dynamic and retrieved via ajax.
[12:39:00] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/utAbUJU/3/edit do this instead.
[12:39:29] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: I don't really consider it a bug, but that sounds good haha.
[12:40:17] <V8Energy> BillCriswell: but it triggers everytime i click on  anything within a form.. all inputs etc..
[12:41:13] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: Target the form more specifically.
[12:41:37] <BillCriswell> or the parent container of the form assuming that's not dynamically added.
[12:42:28] <BillCriswell> <div class="loads-form-via-ajax"></div> then you can do $('.loads-form-via-ajax').on('click', 'form', foo );
[12:43:21] <V8Energy> BillCriswell: this seems to work: http://jsbin.com/utAbUJU/4/edit
[12:43:30] <BillCriswell> You can also do like $(document).on('click', '#form-add-something', foo );
[12:43:32] <initself> how do i get my returned data out from $.ajax({ success }) ?
[12:43:53] <initself> i understand that the first argument to success is the data returned from the server on success
[12:44:19] <initself> how do i get that out to the routined that called the ajax?
[12:44:30] <initself> can access it from the ajax object itself?
[12:44:52] <BillCriswell> initself: You don't get it out of there really. You can pass it to a function. function( response ){ foo( response ); }  then have foo( response ) { // Do things with response }
[12:45:23] <initself> i see
[12:45:27] <initself> i can do that!
[12:45:50] <BillCriswell> initself: Awesome. A lot of people don't like that answer.
[12:46:21] <BillCriswell> Then just want to be able to do like var ajaxRequestResult = $.ajax(...); but it doesn't work that way.
[12:46:33] <BillCriswell> s/Then/They
[12:48:05] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: Glad you got it working.
[12:50:09] <Christer> Is there anyway to set .data values trough attributes on an element? so i can access them trough $('element').data('key') ?
[12:51:24] <BillCriswell> Christer: Just add a second argument as the value.
[12:51:58] <BillCriswell> $('element').data('key', 'value'); $('element').data('key'); // Returns "value"
[12:52:37] <BillCriswell> This won't add attributes to the element, but it saves data to them. If you _need_ the attributes you can do $('element').attr('data-key', 'value');
[12:52:38] <Christer> BillCriswell, yeah thats fine. but then it has to be added trough jquery as well. I was thinking about passing the elements to the view trough PHP.
[12:53:27] <BillCriswell> Christer: Ah, so you could just do <element data-key="<?php echo $key ?>"></element> then.
[12:53:38] <nhulea> is there a way to access this var springDay = 0; .each funtion outside of the closure http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/AVLgA/5/ I am getting 0 when it isnt 0 inside the .each
[12:53:44] <BillCriswell> You can still read it with .data('key')
[12:53:55] <BillCriswell> Just won't update it... if I'm understanding right.
[12:53:58] <BillCriswell> I think I need a redbull
[12:54:04] <nhulea> me too
[12:54:17] <Christer> im using .data to store information about the elements, and i read them again when saving. but if i add them like <element data-key="myValue"> it seems like i have to use the attr. instead.
[12:54:50] <guideX> is there such a thing as themes for jquery chosen?
[12:54:59] <nhulea> could I do return springDay;
[12:55:33] <Christer> BillCriswell: Will they get updated if i change the value? just not in the source code? or is it not possible to change them with .data when doing it like that?
[12:56:06] <BillCriswell> The attributes won't get updated, but the data will be updated.
[12:56:08] <Christer> guideX - As far as i know, its only .css - I bought a template from themeforest. and they had manipulated the css for it. so should be possible.
[12:56:19] <guideX> oh cool
[12:56:21] <Christer> BillCriswell: Sweet =) Thanks!
[12:56:27] <guideX> thanks for the info
[12:56:27] <nhulea> is there a way to access a var outside of .each
[12:56:37] <guideX> I love this plugin btw :)
[12:56:53] <Christer> nhulea: define the variable before the .each ? :)
[12:57:04] <nhulea> yeah I did that
[12:57:14] <nhulea> var springDay = 0;
[12:58:01] <Christer> nhulea: and it doesnt work ?
[12:58:08] <nhulea> no
[12:58:19] <Christer> could you show in a jsfiddle?
[12:58:20] <nhulea> well it does but it returns 0
[12:58:41] <Christer> guideX: Yeah, its pretty cool :)
[12:58:49] <BillCriswell> Christer: Think I was right. http://jsbin.com/oZoqUCO/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:58:56] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/AVLgA/6/
[12:59:11] <nhulea> see
[12:59:15] <nhulea> it returns 0
[12:59:29] <ftj> Hey y'all. Looking for a simple frontend JS framework that does data binding. I need it only for a single view in the admin panel of a Rails app I'm building, and I'd rather not use something as heavy as Angular, Ember, et al
[13:00:13] <Christer> BillCriswell: Sweet =D
[13:01:06] <ftj> To clarify: I have a view containing an image that users will add "annotations" to (by clicking on the image). The annotations' coordinates/id need to be bound/synced to another view (a text-based view) on the same page.
[13:01:15] <nhulea> I am confused it should work
[13:01:59] <Christer> nhulea: Try removing the var infront of the second springDay
[13:02:11] <nhulea> ok
[13:02:37] <V8Energy> BillCriswell: unfortunately using this method doesn't allow me to use e.preventDefault();, it submits the form. i am trying to make it ajaxified
[13:03:33] <ajpiano> ftj: i think ppl like knockout.js for that usecase
[13:03:46] <ftj> ajpiano: Great. Thanks for the suggestion.
[13:04:16] <nhulea> that kinda of worked now its only reading the last number in the array
[13:05:35] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: http://jsbin.com/utAbUJU/5/edit?html,js,output
[13:06:24] <BillCriswell> Starting escaping the quotes but stopped, they don't need the \.
[13:06:44] <nhulea> the console log inside the .each works but the one outside does not
[13:08:42] <nhulea> outside the .each it only outputs the last number in the array and inside it loops through all 4 numbers in the array I need that behavior on the outside
[13:10:14] <BillCriswell> nhulea: http://jsfiddle.net/AVLgA/7/ Is tht what you're going for?
[13:10:36] <Christer> nhulea: an example of how it works. http://jsfiddle.net/AVLgA/8/
[13:11:21] <nhulea> ok cool  thanks I see the
[13:11:32] <V8Energy> BillCriswell: you are a genius. thank you.
[13:11:35] <nhulea> you guys are awesomw
[13:11:37] <nhulea> ew
[13:11:39] <nhulea> e
[13:11:54] <BillCriswell> You said we were awesome then ewwed us?
[13:12:12] <BillCriswell> V8Energy: Glad I could help.
[13:12:30] <maxmoore14> anyone know when theme roller will be updated for jqm 1.4 ?
[13:12:31] <nhulea> no "e" and "w" are right next too each other and I mis typed
[13:12:34] <nhulea> my bad
[13:12:54] <Z_A_M> Hi. I have a text input and a button that sends an ajax call when the button is click(). How do I register it the call to happen when the user hits enter as well as click the button?
[13:13:01] <BillCriswell> nhulea: LIKELY STORY
[13:13:09] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I wasn't serious.
[13:13:27] <nhulea> but serious I suck at typing
[13:13:29] <nhulea> haha
[13:13:35] <Christer> BillCriswell: LIKELY STORY!
[13:13:37] <Christer> ^^,
[13:13:55] <Christer> U serious as he*l ^^
[13:13:58] <nhulea> I need to take a typing class or something
[13:14:04] <nhulea> haha
[13:14:22] <Christer> nhulea: Just get a custom keyboard where the e and w are more spaced ;)
[13:14:38] <nhulea> yeah sounds like mucho $
[13:15:14] <Christer> nhulea: http://www.chestercreek.com/media/products/visionBoardBlackLG.jpg
[13:15:35] <nhulea> gd whoa !
[13:15:45] <EHLOVader> Is chrome a browser that you would have to keep bug workarounds in your code for? are the browsers not always updated automatically for the user?
[13:15:58] <nhulea> Christer: that is actually kinda cool
[13:16:11] <Christer> Hahaha
[13:16:11] <EHLOVader> I know updating is certainly more of a seamless process than old IEs
[13:16:30] <silmarils> hello, I'm looking for help with isotope filters jquery plugins, can someone help me ?
[13:16:55] <EHLOVader> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=51469 is an issue where the common workarounds seem to be triggered in the case of tab to the next form element
[13:18:44] <EHLOVader> in between one input, to the next the body is the activeelement
[13:19:21] <EHLOVader> oh, the ['HTML', 'BODY'].indexOf(e.target.tagName) == -1 will actually be better than document.activeElement === this.body().get(0) it shouldn't suffer from the same race conditions
[13:19:45] <Z_A_M> never mind i figured it out
[13:20:20] <culh> I'm updating content to a element with fixed height and overflow, and need the scrool bar to page down everytime the content updates. Any clues on how to get this done?
[13:20:52] <Christer> Z_A_M: Sorry, you question disappered in the clutter of the chat. :)
[13:22:28] <Asmooh> i have a issue! http://photorate.appserver.aeglobalresearch.com/ios/login.html  <<<<< well i dont have to see
[13:22:31] <Z_A_M> Christer: No worries. Thanks for the response. I fixed it but it seems kinda like a janky fix cause I used jQuery inline.
[13:23:13] <Asmooh> it takes 2 styles at the same time
[13:23:14] <Asmooh> whyyy
[13:23:47] <Z_A_M> that's a huge sign in button
[13:24:08] <Asmooh> hehe yeah looks smaller on a iphone ofc
[13:24:09] <Asmooh> :P
[13:25:51] <Christer> culh: http://jsfiddle.net/FV2jW/
[13:27:56] <culh> Got it working with something I already had, it was a DOM+CSS bug, thanks
[13:28:18] <fonko> hey guys, im having a big issue... two days now and i can't figure this out
[13:28:23] <fonko> pleaseeee help me
[13:29:26] <fonko> the thing is that i have a "mobile" site... or sort of... i was using bootstrap and jquery, then i thought about jquery mobile but when i link to jquerymobile library i get a blank page in chrome mobile... but its ok in desktop chrome
[13:30:51] <Christer> culh: Good, heres another example with updating :) http://jsfiddle.net/3Wx3U/85/
[13:31:48] <fonko> so when i comment this line... the jquery mobile... i can see the page but with no css
[13:32:14] <alexfu> i've got a strange issue with fadeIn & fadeOut with an image. seems like after i fade an image out and try to fade it back in, it no longer works
[13:32:41] <alexfu> the fadeIn and fadeOut happens inside of a hover callback
[13:34:17] <fonko> lkj
[13:37:50] <BillCriswell> Alexer: .hover() is deprecated I think?
[13:38:39] <saimon69> somebody uses promin here? am trying to make a partial validation using the next button
[13:38:50] <saimon69> and have no clue on how to trigger that
[13:44:37] <Ziber> I'm using the sortable plugin, and I want a way to remove all CSS (specifically a bottom border) from an element while it's being moved. I've attempted that on http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/ but the bottom border is being dragged with it.
[13:45:09] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: it went off to the client so thanks again for the help!
[13:45:19] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: No problem!
[13:48:10] <maxmoore14> anyone know when theme roller will be updated for jqm 1.4 ?
[13:48:58] <duckgoose> :>
[13:52:55] <Z_A_M> Why does my jquery work with I use jQuery but not $?
[13:53:22] <NoiseEee> Z_A_M: have you got another library scoped to $ ?
[13:53:43] <Z_A_M> NoiseEee: Literally no idea.
[13:54:02] <NoiseEee> Z_A_M: well what happens in your console when you type $
[13:54:25] <Kambfhase> Some CMS automatically call jQuery.noConflict()
[13:54:31] <Z_A_M> NoiseEee: function()
[13:55:47] <NoiseEee> well *somethings* doing that.  but what Kambfhase said prolly
[13:56:03] <Ziber> Would anyone mind taking a look at http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/? I'm trying to disable the bottom border while an item in the lists is being dragged. I've attempted with the start, stop events, but that doesn't seem to be doing the trick.
[13:58:00] <silmarils> Ziber, why don't you add .ondamove{border:none}; ?
[13:58:25] <Ziber> Oh, I suppose I could do that. Let's see here.
[13:58:40] <Kambfhase> Ziber: change `.ui-sortable li { ... }` to `.ui-sortable li:not(.ondamove) { ... }`
[13:58:58] <alexfu> does .fadeIn() or .fadeOut() modify the dimensions of the element?
[13:59:19] <Ziber> Ahhh, yeah, that'll work nicely too.
[13:59:58] <chilversc> that or, .ui-sortable li { ... } and .ui-sortable li.ondamove { ... }
[14:00:02] <Ziber> Thank you!
[14:00:22] <chilversc> Ziber: the problem being that ".ui-sortable li" is more specific than ".ondamove"
[14:00:24] <Z_A_M> Kambfhase: I am using the Django web framework
[14:01:15] <Ziber> One other thing, too. And sorry, I guess this is more of a CSS question. Each item has a bottom border, and the entire list has a border. The last item's border overlaps the bottom border, making it appear bigger. Can I solve this somehow?
[14:01:30] <Kambfhase> what chilversc said. try `.ondamove.ondamove.ondamove { border: none }`
[14:01:57] <chilversc> Kambfhase: does that actually work?
[14:02:12] <Kambfhase> TIAS
[14:02:27] <chilversc> Kambfhase: heh, that's such a hack :)
[14:03:00] <Kambfhase> yeah
[14:03:41] <Ziber> Can I do something to signify specific CSS for the last item?
[14:06:11] <Kambfhase> !important
[14:06:12] <b-ot> Kambfhase: for overriding previous css
[14:06:16] <Kambfhase> :S
[14:06:24] <Ziber> ?
[14:06:28] <Kambfhase> b-ot: thanks
[14:06:44] <Kambfhase> b-ot: i love you
[14:08:27] <Kambfhase> aw, man, I liked the old bo-t better.
[14:09:44] <Brodingo> b-ot you are but a shadow of your predecessor
[14:15:17] <Ziber> Well, off to the gym. Bbl.
[14:18:07] <Wanfu> I have a div that has .droppable added to it, which allows me to drop images onto it, etc etc. What I also did was bind the 'drop' event to it, so I could drop images from my desktop. But now this only triggers. and not the .droppable({ }) event
[14:19:07] <Wanfu> dropping an item from within the website, always runs 'drop' event now, not 'droppable'.so I am kind of stuck
[14:24:47] <IO-ERROR-1> Hi. I need to replace URL with user input on submit. How to do it with JQuery ???
[14:27:16] <Christer> IO-ERROR-1 - You cant manipulate the URL shown on the top of the browser. You can redirect the user. But its outside the DOM.
[14:27:51] <Christer> You CAN however manipulate it with .htaccess or routing.
[14:27:56] <talntid> i think he's actually trying to say he wants to do GET
[14:28:00] <talntid> instead of POST
[14:28:19] <talntid> so the user input shows up in the URL
[14:28:23] <ylandsman> Looking for some help with styling a modal dialog.  I want to eliminate the title bar, and have a circle with an X for the close button on the top right hand corner of the dialog.  I have seen this but have no idea about how to go about it.
[14:28:37] <talntid> url.php?key=value&key2=value2
[14:28:41] <Christer> talntid - aha. sorry :)
[14:29:14] <IO-ERROR-1> talntid: yes - GET
[14:29:23] <Christer> ylandsman: Bootstrap?
[14:29:34] <ylandsman> no jqueryui
[14:29:45] <IO-ERROR-1> Christer: ??? I need to redirect to get request
[14:29:53] <IO-ERROR-1> Christer: sorry, I dont understand this
[14:32:29] <Christer> IO-ERROR-1 - my mistake, i misunderstood your question. If you want to do a get request. Just make the user fill in the form and use http://api.jquery.com/submit/ to submit the form trough jquery
[14:33:10] <ylandsman> christer: no jqueryui
[14:34:17] <Christer> ylandsman - Its all done trough .css - Inspect the element you want to change in the dialog. and look up what class you need to manipulate / hide. :)
[14:34:53] <ylandsman> christer: I get that, but how would I create the circular close button?
[14:35:01] <IO-ERROR-1> Christer: Yes your mistake again. You cannot use this form API, because it doesnt support replacing user input into URL. Obviously you don't know anything about this subject
[14:37:14] <Christer> IO-ERROR-1: Excuse me for trying then!
[14:37:27] <talntid> yeah, gotta love the appreciation.
[14:37:45] <silmarils> Ziber, why don't you add .ondamove{border:none}; ?
[14:37:48] <silmarils> hello, I'm looking for help with isotope filters jquery plugins, can someone help me ?
[14:39:22] <Christer> ylandsman: Give me a sec. ill check
[14:39:43] <ylandsman> christer: thank you so much
[14:42:40] <BillCriswell> IO-ERROR-1: Sheesh.
[14:43:31] <Christer> ylandsman: do you have jqueryui.css available?
[14:47:19] <ylandsman> christer: No I don't, where do I get it from?  It isn't part of the standard download
[14:47:33] <Christer> should be.
[14:47:38] <Christer> jquery-ui.css
[14:48:33] <ylandsman> Ah, I found it, it appears that there is a separate one for each theme
[14:48:48] <Christer> true. :)
[14:49:07] <ylandsman> Haven't played with the theming yet
[14:49:16] <ylandsman> what should I look for there?
[14:50:08] <Christer> If its an exact match, you should look at line 853.
[14:50:23] <Christer> Theres a rule like this: .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-titlebar-close span
[14:51:05] <ylandsman> christer:okay, so should I modify that rule? and if so, how?
[14:52:14] <Christer> You can try changing the background image thats listed there (Dont remove the old one, keep it as a backup) - look for an icon online.
[14:52:47] <ylandsman> christer: thanks a million
[14:58:11] <ylandsman> christer: in the copy I have, that rule doesn't exist
[14:59:04] <ylandsman> christer: there is a rule .ul-dialog ui-dialog-titlebar-close   but it doesnt have a background image defined
[14:59:39] <Christer> Just under that.
[14:59:41] <Christer> atleast here
[15:00:06] <ylandsman> christer: looks like we have different copies :(
[15:00:48] <Christer> aha, try inspecting your dialog and see what class is used on the X
[15:01:13] <raj> how do I find out what element types are allowed to be .editable() using jeditable?
[15:01:17] <ylandsman> christer: I will - you have been most helpful  thanks
[15:02:28] <ryanneufeld> raj: you'd have to check with the jeditable maintainers or documentation for that.
[15:02:54] <raj> this documentation seems very flimsy http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[15:03:06] <raj> I was hoping someone had knowledge of something better
[15:04:36] <Christer> raj: check out the demos. http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/custom.html & http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html
[15:07:03] <raj> also, I have a universal Edit button that I want to use to turn 10 fields editable
[15:07:07] <raj> is this possible with jeditable?
[15:08:18] <Christer> raj: yes.
[15:08:47] <raj> only by simulating a click Christer?
[15:17:30] <raj> I am using jeditable. I have a universal Edit button that I want to use to turn 10 fields editable. Can I do this without having a click handler on each <p> element? (since those clicks will never be used, due to the universal Edit button)
[15:23:52] <Christer> raj: What happens if you do $('.myEditableElements').click(); when the button itself is clicked
[15:26:05] <raj> noting
[15:26:07] <raj> nothing
[15:30:43] <Christer> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/Eqt7h/51/
[15:31:03] <Christer> Click the Submit All button.
[15:31:15] <Christer> Dont worry about the name. just forgot to change it.
[15:32:49] <raj> Christer, I don't want the fields click-editable
[15:33:13] <raj> so does it seem ridiculous to base all of this off simulating a click event?
[15:33:32] <Richhh> whats this about ? http://s10.postimg.org/3x0zxxmpl/problem_with_chrome.png
[15:33:48] <Richhh> everyone else got that too?
[15:34:01] <raj> should I just manually move <p>'s text to <input>'s value?
[15:34:43] <Christer> raj. i would. Not a big problem. And "more" control :)
[15:35:18] <obert> a p inside input??
[15:36:05] <Christer> swap the contents of a p inside a input / textarea :) and take the value back to into the p again when done editing :) obert
[15:36:57] <talntid> Richhh, mine does the same.
[15:37:05] <talntid> what's to say it is a problem, though?
[15:37:44] <Richhh> not a major problem
[15:38:08] <Richhh> reassured that its the new chrome version's problem
[15:38:26] <Christer> aaaah, saw it now.
[15:38:30] <Christer> alot of windows there :P
[15:38:36] <Christer> tought it was some sort of popup spam
[15:38:37] <Christer> :P
[15:40:03] <talntid> i guess you can consider a change a problem. guess thats why you still use XP. systems evolve, and that evolution isn't generally a "problem". guess it's all subjective
[15:40:17] <raj> Christer, k, thanks for the talk :)
[15:41:32] <Richhh> talntid im not using xp, that is a friend's laptop in China, notice the start button
[15:42:46] <talntid> i noticed the start button - hence the XP reference.
[15:43:46] <Richhh> i support change that i think is for the better :)
[15:45:36] <obert> Christer: :p
[15:53:11] <silmarils> hello, I'm looking for help with isotope filters jquery plugins, can someone help me ?
[16:00:52] <goddard> can some one take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/9qQX2/
[16:01:33] <goddard> this one sorry http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/9qQX2/1/
[16:05:45] <goddard> this one sorry http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/9qQX2/3/
[16:34:17] <goddard> anyone?
[16:42:29] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/9qQX2/14/
[16:44:04] <talntid> goddard, including a question with your fiddle may help you better
[17:17:11] <goddard> talntid: oh i thought the html and javascript kind of explained it my bad
[17:17:29] <goddard> im trying to figure out how to drop the boxes only on the table cells that are within the date range
[17:17:48] <goddard> i put the values in the div elements and the td elements have their date
[17:49:51] <JimmyXander> small question
[17:50:42] <JimmyXander> How would I go about loading an image using jQuery. Say I click a button then I want a loading gif to appear, then when the image is finished loading I want it to fade in
[17:50:48] <JimmyXander> what functions would I use?
[17:54:14] <Velveeta> You should probably preload an image like that using a css rule, and then apply that to a hidden element and fade it in, so there's no load time involved...
[17:54:39] <JimmyXander> well I want to load in a set of images
[17:54:44] <JimmyXander> like a lightbox
[17:54:53] <JimmyXander> kept on the page
[17:54:56] <Velveeta> Oh ok, gotcha
[17:55:02] <Velveeta> And you want to lazy load those?
[17:55:12] <Velveeta> like thumbnails first, full images lazy-loaded?
[17:56:14] <JimmyXander> No like I click this box and then it expands and loads in a set of related images
[17:56:29] <Velveeta> with spinners in place until each one loads?
[17:56:54] <JimmyXander> nah only need one spinner
[17:56:57] <JimmyXander> I have that gif
[17:57:21] <JimmyXander> I'll make it expand a little, show the gif then expand all the way before fading in the images
[17:58:47] <Velveeta> then what you could do is create a $.Deferred object for each image you're adding to the document, and write the img tags into the document, hidden, with an onload event that resolves each deferred object in that list, and pass that list of deferrers into a $.when call, with one handler for when they're all done, to show the images and hide/remove the spinner
[17:59:15] <JimmyXander> no idea what you just said
[17:59:16] <Velveeta> i've had to do something similar in the past, worked like a charm
[17:59:26] <JimmyXander> <- Noob
[17:59:30] <Velveeta> have you used jquery's deferred objects yet?
[17:59:35] <JimmyXander> Nope
[17:59:52] <JimmyXander> I can make things .fadeIn() though =)
[18:00:00] <Velveeta> ahhh ok, so i would first advise going to read up on them here ( http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ )
[18:00:01] <JimmyXander> I'm a designer
[18:00:07] <JimmyXander> k
[18:00:28] <Velveeta> then, for each image you know you're going to load, create a deferred object and push it onto an array, one to represent each image
[18:00:36] <Velveeta> that way you can track the loaded state of each one separately
[18:00:41] <JimmyXander> what is a callback queue?
[18:01:12] <Velveeta> then write out the image tags like $(myContainer).append('<img src="path/to/image" onload="deferredArray[someIndexNumber].resolve();" />');
[18:01:35] <Velveeta> a callback queue is a list of callbacks to be fired when something is resolved or rejected
[18:01:52] <Velveeta> here, hold on, i actually have a post somewhere about this exact kind of situation :D
[18:02:32] <JimmyXander> =)
[18:05:34] <Velveeta> ok i sent you a link to my post about it, in a private message
[18:19:11] <brcweggs> Does anyone know how to debug a website that's being run via an iOS app's built-in browser? Not mobile Safari, but the "web view" component built into a lot of apps.
[18:21:34] <Velveeta> this looks promising: https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/DebuggingSafarioniPhoneContent/DebuggingSafarioniPhoneContent.html
[18:26:47] <brcweggs> Velveeta, thanks, I tried that method, but it appears that you're only able to debug iOS apps that you own or have developer access to. In my case, I'm just trying to fix my website when it's viewed via Facebook/Twitter's built-in browser, so I believe it's a no-go.
[18:29:16] <Velveeta> Yowza… hmmmmm…… it's been a while since i had to deal with Facebook apps, and never had to do any iOS debugging of them… the only thing that immediately jumps to mind would be pretty horrible :D you could fire an ajax request to a server-side logging function, which could ship data about the app's state, and then load it up on the iPad and see what data you receive in your server logs
[18:31:26] <brcweggs> Velveeta, Interesting! Thanks for the tip, I might have to try that one out.
[18:31:44] <Velveeta> it's ugly, but it just might work
[18:34:54] <brcweggs> Velveeta, maybe just a try/catch statement that fires alerts would do the trick...
[18:35:49] <Velveeta> if you don't mind firing alerts in that Facebook app, that would've been my first suggestion.. i just assumed it was something already out in production that you'd want a more silent method of logging :)
[18:38:21] <brcweggs> I have a handy development copy published too
[18:38:38] <brcweggs> it's just a website that's being viewed via facebook, not necessarily a facebook app
[18:38:43] <brcweggs> thanks for the help!
[18:38:49] <Velveeta> nice, no problem, good luck :)
[18:54:59] <Zak> did jquery.com just die
[18:55:08] <Zak> getting 502
[18:56:47] <pixelpimp> same here
[19:06:03] <dwarder_> is it ok to send  application/json in header for jsonp ?
[19:06:05] <Zak> ah, i think its fixed now
[19:06:35] <Zak> dwarder_: use application/javascript
[19:06:36] <dwarder_> not to send application/javascript
[19:07:08] <dwarder_> Zak: so is it ... ok?
[19:07:14] <dwarder_> not to use application/javascript
[19:07:51] <dwarder_> what are consequences
[19:10:36] <SkiOne> hi, I need a sanity check. I am using an ajaxForm plugin to upload a profile pic and I want to update the pic after it has been uploaded. The file uploads and the json returns the URL to the image and on page refresh it shows. This is the code that does the submit and then attempts to load the image. The alert will pop up with the right image: http://pastebin.com/hSy4TGpe Am I missing something with regards to changing image src?
[19:11:15] <aFeijo> Hey guys, how can I build an zoom effect like this site www.activetv.tv ?
[19:11:27] <Manusoftar> i need to adjust a div size to it's contents, do anyone know a good way to achieve it?
[19:12:11] <pixelpimp> display: inline;
[19:13:26] <Manusoftar> i need it to grow/shrink dynamically both horizontally and vertically, do you think that -> display: inline; will be enough?
[19:13:39] <pixelpimp> no.
[19:17:57] <SkiOne> anyone, updating image src?
[19:18:14] <Manusoftar> also i need to use position:relative; because how my layout is made
[19:18:51] <Manusoftar> SkiOne: you could use attr('src','whathever url of the new image is');
[19:19:17] <SkiOne> yea thats what I am doing and it just silently failed, thanks
[19:19:26] <Manusoftar> o_O
[19:19:46] <SkiOne> I wish there was an error message but none such luck
[19:19:57] <Manusoftar> are you using firebug?
[19:20:03] <SkiOne> chrome
[19:20:14] <Manusoftar> oh, development tools?
[19:20:18] <SkiOne> yes
[19:20:28] <Manusoftar> perhaps you may debug on firefox ???
[19:20:34] <SkiOne> everything works, I see the json return
[19:20:45] <SkiOne> the alert pops up
[19:20:48] <SkiOne> I could try FF
[19:20:54] <Manusoftar> although chrome should show errors if any... o_O
[19:21:19] <SkiOne> I typically found the 2 pretty equal in their dev tools
[19:21:30] <SkiOne> but since I am out of ideas, I will try that
[19:26:51] <SkiOne_> Manusoftar yup silent fail in FF as well
[19:53:31] <Manusoftar> SkiOne_: is there a link where we can see your site?
[19:58:29] <Manusoftar> SkiOne_: perhaps you may try a console.log($('#user-proile-photo-img')) right before trying to update it's src, i'm beginning to think this may be an issue of scopes!

[20:05:42] <pranavrc> Hi. I'm using jStorage to save a json object to local storage, but only an empty object gets stored. The object I want to store is pretty huge and nested, and I realize that the limit is 5 MB, but how do I check if my object exceeds the limit (which is pretty unlikely)? If not, what may be causing an empty dictionary to get stored?
[20:06:14] <pranavrc> I tested it with a simple json object and it seems to work
[20:07:51] <pranavrc> I tried copying the the object from the console and saving it to a file to check the file size, but I ended up crashing a couple of text editors in the process, actually :p
[20:09:56] <aFeijo> how can I scroll the content inside a div by code?

[21:31:34] <El_Caballero> minlenght and delay.
[21:48:48] <doug65536> El_Caballero: where's the jquery?
[21:50:35] <doug65536> El_Caballero: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[21:52:17] <El_Caballero> yes, I tried setting $(this.$el).autocomplete( "option", "delay", 500 ); But It didn't work :(
[21:53:06] <El_Caballero> I tried that after the $(this.$el).autocomplete("refresh");
[21:53:17] <doug65536> El_Caballero: when?
[21:54:12] <doug65536> El_Caballero: during initialization?
[21:54:12] <El_Caballero> http://pastebin.com/86hdGNDW
[21:54:14] <El_Caballero> there
[21:54:18] <El_Caballero> no
[21:54:42] <El_Caballero> not during initialization. It was in the render function
[21:55:01] <El_Caballero> let me try at initialization
[21:56:46] <El_Caballero> one second. My computer is slow :(
[21:58:39] <El_Caballero> no
[21:58:49] <El_Caballero> It doesnt' work
[21:59:01] <El_Caballero> it still autocomplete with the first keystroke
[21:59:48] <doug65536> initialize it in the .autocomplete call
[22:00:16] <doug65536> $(whatever).autocomplete({minLength: 3, delay: 2000});
[22:00:42] <El_Caballero> oh, ok
[22:00:44] <El_Caballero> let me try
[22:00:46] <doug65536> and don't call option or anything
[22:03:44] <El_Caballero> running... loading... one sec
[22:04:15] <Manusoftar> doug65536: have you tried the bootstrap responsive version?
[22:04:30] <doug65536> they're all responsive
[22:04:51] <Manusoftar> but there is a bootstrap-responsive.css?
[22:05:13] <doug65536> don't know what that is or what's in it
[22:05:25] <doug65536> might be a subset of the full bootstrap
[22:10:17] <Manusoftar> perhaps it was an older version the one i've seen on a youtube tutorial, and they probably included everything on bootstrap.css
[22:15:46] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I looked it up. in bootstrap 2, the responsive stuff was separate. in 3 they are all in one

[23:12:46] <El_Caballero> I was locally stored
[23:12:52] <El_Caballero> in the sqlite db
[23:13:11] <El_Caballero> btw, I mean JQuery Mobile.
[23:13:14] <doug65536> El_Caballero: so you use the callback source?
[23:15:19] <El_Caballero> doug65536: well, I am not totally sure
[23:16:10] <El_Caballero> let me try a little more.
[23:17:32] <doug65536> El_Caballero: works with callback http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ZcNtz/4/
[23:18:50] <El_Caballero> doug65536: oh, yes. Exacly.
[23:19:00] <El_Caballero> doug65536: it doesn't have the options hardcoded
[23:19:37] <doug65536> right, I just hard coded them for simplicity - langs could be from a real data source
[23:19:46] <aro> why is it that sometimes $('form').submit(); works, and sometiems it doesnt?
[23:20:07] <doug65536> aro: if there are multiple forms that might malfunction
[23:20:13] <aro> theres only one
[23:20:20] <aro> we are selecting by id
[23:20:48] <aro> im just saying, that for a list of links, it works on the first two, but not the last one
[23:20:49] <doug65536> aro: define "works"
[23:20:59] <aro> uhh.. submits the form?
[23:21:32] <Cork> aro: there is too little context to give an answer to that
[23:21:49] <Cork> aro: most likely it is something about events or similar, but it is impossible to tell from that line
[23:22:14] <aro>     $(document.body).on('click', '.execute-search', function(event) { });
[23:22:30] <aro> the inside of the braces doesnt get run for the last item in the list
[23:22:52] <Cork> aro: too little context
[23:23:29] <Cork> aro: start by trying to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[23:25:23] <sdwrage> Hey all. I have an element selected $(".myelement"); and want to select a childs contents such as <div class="comment"> hey there </div>
[23:25:27] <sdwrage> how would I do this?
[23:25:56] <Cork> sdwrage: $(".myelement").find('comment').html()
[23:25:59] <Cork> opps
[23:26:04] <Cork> * $(".myelement").find('.comment').html()
[23:26:23] <sdwrage> even if I've already stored that element?
[23:26:37] <doug65536> sdwrage: or .text() if you want plaintext
[23:26:43] <sdwrage> var comments = $(".entry .collapsed");
[23:26:49] <Cork> var selection = $(".myelement"); selection.find('.comment')
[23:26:56] <sdwrage> var winner = comments[Math.floor(Math.random()*comments.length)];
[23:26:57] <Cork> so yes you can
[23:27:06] <sdwrage> hrm
[23:27:12] <sdwrage> I tried that didn't work
[23:27:24] <Cork> are you sure it is a child?
[23:27:34] <Cork> (please share the html structure)
[23:28:00] <sdwrage> TypeError: Object [ DIV.collapsed ] has no method 'find'
[23:28:10] <r1card> Are Ui question ok here (jquery UI)?
[23:28:14] <r1card> questionS
[23:28:20] <Cork> sdwrage: then what your running on isn't a jquery objecct
[23:28:21] <doug65536> sdwrage: you have a dom element, wrap it with $()
[23:28:31] <sdwrage> ah okay
[23:28:37] <Cork> doug65536: no it isn't a plain element either
[23:29:16] <doug65536> r1card: yes
[23:29:21] <r1card> doug65536, thanks.
[23:29:35] <r1card> So I'm using theme "smoothness" and instantiating a basic modal dialog. It looks oversized.
[23:29:37] <sdwrage> using it with jsdom and nodejs so not sure if I am hitting the right channel
[23:29:44] <sdwrage> its one of those "in the middle" questions
[23:29:45] <r1card> Is there anything controlling the theme 'scale'
[23:30:11] <Cork> sdwrage: the object you have isn't jquery, that is why you can't run jquery commands
[23:30:44] <sdwrage> Cork, well it seems to fetch it just fine and randomly select just fine as I can console.log it perfectly
[23:31:05] <sdwrage> nvm I got it
[23:31:12] <sdwrage> var winner_name = $(winner).find(".author").text();
[23:31:24] <sdwrage> actually doug65536 was indeed correct
[23:31:26] <sdwrage> ;)
[23:32:13] <doug65536> sdwrage: I'm surprised that worked. I've never seen a tostring that looks like what you posted
[23:32:42] <doug65536> sdwrage: was a guess
[23:32:46] <Cork> it is some other frameworks selection
[23:33:08] <sdwrage> ill show you the code as soon as a push it to github
[23:33:10] <doug65536> maybe they override dom element tostring or something evil like that
[23:33:28] <sdwrage> I just threw together a small node.js script that scrapes a reddit post for a random comment
[23:33:38] <sdwrage> its to be used on the "RandomActsOf" pages
[23:33:47] <doug65536> ah ok, of course. it's not even a browser. makes sense
[23:36:18] <r1card> How does one set the theme 'scale' in jQueryUI?
[23:36:43] <Cork> r1card: there scale?
[23:36:57] <Cork> r1card: the theme is just css + a few images
[23:37:37] <doug65536> r1card: here's a quick hack. probably not advisable http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/t8Hzn/
[23:38:11] <Cork> that would only work in fairly modern browsers
[23:38:24] <doug65536> r1card: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/t8Hzn/1/ <-- better
[23:38:36] <Cork> and it would risk causing rendering to be much slower
[23:38:51] <doug65536> or faster
[23:38:54] <Cork> no
[23:38:59] <doug65536> yes
[23:39:02] <Cork> it won't ever be faster then unscaled
[23:39:12] <doug65536> hardware acceleration would be applied to everything
[23:39:20] <Cork> but if the computer doesn't have gpu acceleration it will be slower
[23:39:25] <doug65536> yes
[23:39:38] <Cork> doug65536: gpu acceleration is normally used for normal layers
[23:39:46] <Cork> but if you don't have gpu possible
[23:39:54] <Cork> the cpu would have to scale it on every rendering
[23:40:36] <Anes> Cork: Hi dear
[23:40:37] <doug65536> it's not like it is scaling a bitmap though.
[23:41:07] <Anes> Cork: I need to make 11 js files to single js file
[23:41:10] <Cork> doug65536: well you will still have to translate everything
[23:41:18] <Cork> doug65536: and you would have to scale images
[23:41:33] <Anes> Cork: any idea pls?
[23:41:39] <Cork> Anes: cat *.js > scripts.js
[23:41:39] <doug65536> bitblt has been done in hardware since win 3.1
[23:41:58] <Cork> doug65536: you can't bitblt scale an image
[23:42:09] <Cork> that would at best give you nerestnabure
[23:42:22] <Anes> Cork: but i have no linux pc dear , just windows 7
[23:42:33] <Cork> Anes: please drop the dear...
[23:42:47] <Anes> ok
[23:42:57] <Cork> Anes: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm
[23:43:17] <doug65536> what?
[23:43:20] <doug65536> use copy
[23:43:29] <doug65536> copy *.js scripts.js
[23:44:21] <doug65536> or at worst del scripts.js && for /F %a in (*.js) do type %a >> scripts.js
[23:52:02] <doug65536> r1card: if you do try the transform method, this fixes the width http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/t8Hzn/2/
[23:54:31] <r1card> doug65536, thank you!
[23:57:20] <sdwrage> doug65536, https://github.com/sdwrage/randomactsofrandom/blob/master/readme.md
[23:57:23] <sdwrage> errr
[23:57:32] <sdwrage> https://github.com/sdwrage/randomactsofrandom
[23:57:33] <sdwrage> lol
[23:58:08] <Cork> ah
[23:58:11] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented various jquery countdowns in my web, but these not works. If I implement only one, works, but with multiple no. Anyone can help me?
[23:58:24] <Cork> sdwrage: line 18 is what makes things break a bit
[23:58:47] <Cork> sdwrage: replace comments[Math.floor(Math.random()*comments.length)] with comments.eq(Math.floor(Math.random()*comments.length))
[23:58:55] <Cork> sdwrage: and you won't need $() later
