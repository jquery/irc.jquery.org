[00:22:31] <felixjet_> can someone help me please?
[00:22:39] <felixjet_> im having a problem with .on
[00:22:44] <felixjet_> i have $('.rating div i').on('click', function() {
[00:22:57] <felixjet_> but when i do: $('.rating').html(data);
[00:23:07] <felixjet_> the trigger doesnt work anymore
[00:23:13] <felixjet_> why? if im using .on() ?
[00:23:45] <ravenzz> because you are attaching an event handler to (.rating) div i
[00:23:47] <felixjet_> oh, i think i know what it is
[00:23:48] <felixjet_> yea..
[00:23:51] <ravenzz> which will be replaced
[00:23:52] <felixjet_> should do$(document).on('click'
[00:23:55] <ravenzz> try with
[00:23:55] <felixjet_> right?
[00:24:12] <ravenzz> $('.rating').on('click', 'div i', function () {})
[00:24:18] <ravenzz> and read the documentation!
[00:24:29] <felixjet_> yea sorry
[00:24:47] <ravenzz> np
[00:38:41] <sahbeewah> that is not the reason why the event handler breaks... that line correctly attaches the event handler to the i node
[00:49:04] <Cork> sahbeewah: ya, but then he replaces the element with the event listener
[00:49:13] <Cork> and that is what ravenzz fixed
[00:49:26] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:54:53] <sahbeewah> yes i'm pointing that out as the parentheses implies the reason was that it was attached to the rating class
[00:55:29] <Cork> uh, no it didn't
[00:56:06] <Cork> $('.rating div i').on('click', function() { });
[01:14:05] <wishypw> hi guys, can someone help me with an .ajax to soap web service response? I can get me code to POST a soap envelope and checking my chrome dev tools, I can see that the reponse has been returned
[01:14:24] <wishypw> I just can't get a function to return the response to the browser
[01:15:05] <wishypw> i'm basically doing something like: function name(responseXML) and alert(responseXML)
[01:15:17] <wishypw> (just something simple)
[01:17:49] <nik> hi
[01:18:12] <Guest63820> ok
[01:18:32] <Guest63820> hh
[01:18:39] <Cork> wishypw: sounds like you might be doing cross domain requests
[01:25:13] <wishypw> @cork thanks, i am dev'ing from my office to a hosted location but do ahve access to the server. I came across something about browsers not being able to transport requests to servers unless some code was added to the service on the server-side... but i (think) have done that. the request is successful.. I just can't seem to handle the reponse correctly.. Or am I missing something else?
[01:27:30] <Cork> wishypw: check the browsers console
[01:27:42] <wishypw> ok thanks
[01:27:43] <Cork> it will show a warning there if the request is blocked cause of xss
[01:29:06] <wishypw> I dont see anything in the console.. my alert is returning '[object Object]' if that helps(?)
[01:29:50] <seutje> alert is a douche like that
[01:30:07] <seutje> console.log/dir is where it's at!
[01:31:10] <wishypw> thanks, I'll take a look
[01:32:58] <seutje> common issue when doing ajaxy stuff is the server providing the wrong MIME type in the header
[01:33:51] <Cork> ya
[01:33:54] <Cork> that's very common
[01:34:41] <Cork> the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is a bit finicky too
[01:35:35] <wishypw> ok.. so console.log/dir returned 'NaN'
[01:35:53] <Cork> from what?
[01:36:01] <Cork> oh wait
[01:36:12] <Cork> did you actually run console.log/dir ?
[01:36:26] <wishypw> ..yeah..
[01:36:28] <Cork> console.log() or console.dir()
[01:36:34] <Cork> not log/dir :)
[01:36:40] <wishypw> oh i see! :)
[02:25:30] <PatBateman> hi
[02:27:24] <PatBateman> how is it possible, if I hide() a specific element on a specific screen size, on desktop the hide works well, but on my tablet's landscape mode these elements are visible?
[02:27:58] <PatBateman> Android browser handles hide() different?
[02:28:09] <Cork> PatBateman: if that happens it sounds like a bug in the browser (and yes there is quite a few of those in mobile browsers)
[02:28:19] <PatBateman> ahh
[02:28:21] <PatBateman> thanks
[02:28:31] <Cork> if it is a bug try resizing the element
[02:28:39] <Cork> that usually triggers a reflow and should fix it
[02:28:46] <PatBateman> fire a resize? ahm
[02:28:54] <PatBateman> i see
[02:29:07] <Cork> no as in set/change the width or height of the element
[02:29:13] <Cork> not an event
[02:30:05] <PatBateman> so add eg. +1 pixel to width ?
[02:30:36] <Cork> as a test yes
[02:30:48] <Cork> "wiggle the element" :)
[02:30:53] <PatBateman> nice, ok
[02:57:04] <PatBateman> solved the other way. they where carousels, and i destroyed the carousel after hiding. replaced the order now works
[03:25:30] <walidvb> hi guys, any one knows of a plugin that emulates g+/linkedIn menu bar? that appears when you scroll uo, and disappears when you scroll down? can't find anything on google, too lazy to code it myself(or actually, not getting paid enough ;D)
[03:29:02] <thinced> walidvb: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default
[03:31:36] <lbracher> Hi there! I'm looking for a way to use jqGrid and Google Maps API together. I have a list of coordinates on a jqGrid and the same list on Google Maps embedded on page. I would like to click on a certain coordinate on a list and have the corresponding balloon highlighted on Google Maps. Can you point me the way to do that? Thanks in advance! :)
[03:36:41] <SillyTalker> i cannto get this demo to work on my server and i have no idea why: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/listview-autocomplete-remote/
[03:36:45] <SillyTalker> any ideas?
[03:37:44] <slax0r> check for errors?
[03:52:00] <fabioportieri> how can i prevent useragent spoofing in this scenario: i made a custom animated accordion that has a weird issue on chrome (animation streches way past the container). now to solve this i put a css workaround (a simple fixed width) that minimizes the issue but sluggish the animation in other browsers like firefox. so what i want is use a media query to target chrome (and firefox) only
[03:52:20] <fabioportieri> is it bad practice?
[03:55:00] <walidvb> thinced: it's not about being responsive, it's about hiding when scrolled. see iOS Safari UI
[04:04:28] <PatBateman> is it easy to write a cookie law script? I mean its only saving a cookie if the user agrees ?
[04:09:22] <seutje> PatBateman: there's plenty of examples out there, like cookiecuttr for example
[04:35:10] <Deepak> hello there
[04:38:46] <Deepak> hello mike
[04:44:56] <Deepak> no one here to help me solve my problem
[04:45:20] <PatBateman> did you ask anything? :)
[05:01:54] <seutje> Deepak: we are not mentalists or whatever, we actually need some information to determine what the problem entails
[05:02:03] <Tekla> geez
[05:02:13] <Tekla> wrong channel i guess :P
[05:03:29] <Deepak> ok boss lemme give u an example of what i need to do acctually
[05:03:37] <Tekla> i have a page with lots of dynamically updated content but i can't seem to figure out how to avoid getting all the jquery functions loaded every time i use an .ajax call
[05:04:26] <Tekla> i tried $("body").off() as first thing in .ajaxcomplete() but no luck
[05:06:43] <seutje> Tekla: not sure what you mean, "jquery function" being methods on the jquery namespace, or just javascript functions?
[05:07:02] <kpl> In $(document).ready I do $('#dialog').dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true });  and when I later in a function do $('#dialog').dialog("open");  the dialog is displayed, and is modal, but code execution continues before the dialog is closed. How do I make code exec stop and wait for my response in the dialog?
[05:07:23] <Deepak> seutje: I have got the Values and key of Length, Breadth, and height in one object i.e "dim". and the 'units' in another object i.e "uni" now i want the output to be like this to be stored in result object.
[05:08:23] <Deepak> result = { "dimensions" : {      "length" :{           value:100,           units:g            }      "breadth" :{           "key":200           "Units":g          }      "height" :{           "key":300,           "Units":g              }      } }
[05:10:34] <etbCitizen> someone has worked with jtable jquery plugin?
[05:12:05] <Deepak> asfasfafa
[05:12:48] <seutje> Deepak: like that? http://jsfiddle.net/tzzSv/
[05:17:06] <kpl> When I call prompt( ), js execution stops and waits for the response in the modal dialog. How do I make jQ UI dialog act the same way?
[05:17:48] <Deepak> thanx seutje
[05:18:46] <Junior> yello ;)
[05:19:53] <dfkn> Does anyone know how i can debug all ajax functions on a website of mine?
[05:19:53] <dfkn> like debug all arguments passed to XMLHttpRequest.
[05:19:53] <dfkn> and their namespaces.
[05:21:08] <Junior> my code works properly, but i need to change something. The cause is : a have a table with data . in that table, a have an icon, on which, if i click , a form is filled with data.. I want to make the table clickable (which i did) , i did a click mimic, data is inserted in the form. But it only works once. if i click on another row,
[05:21:16] <Junior> data is displayed for the first row also.
[05:21:21] <Junior> what can i do ?
[05:21:30] <CaptainHeavy> Hey everyone, I'm attempting to use the jQuery datepicker's "getDate" function to return a date after the user has selected one i.e. on a 'blur' event.  However, the first time this code runs it returns null but a subsequent attempt (after changing the date using the datepicker) returns the date previously selected.  I'm looking to return the date just selected everytime rather than it being one step behind, does anybody k
[05:22:47] <etbCitizen> http://jsfiddle.net/LwAVE/
[05:22:49] <CaptainHeavy> May work better with an example: if I select today's today using the datepicker and console.log the result of "getDate" in the blur function I get null but if I change the date to tomorrow the console.log returns today's date
[05:22:58] <CaptainHeavy> *today's date
[05:22:59] <etbCitizen> Why this doen't show me the according messages
[05:30:23] <hellothere> hey there guys, is there any option for me to do for example $('.show_hide').click(function () {
[05:30:23] <hellothere>         $(".slidingDiv").slideToggle();
[05:30:32] <hellothere> to make it hide after 5 seconds?
[05:31:48] <scrupul0us> i have a data-log attr on an element that has values like "1,2,3,4,5,6"... when I alert that or console.log, it doesnt give me one event, it gives me each value like "1" "1,2" "1,2,3" etc... why would this happen?
[05:33:23] <seutje> scrupul0us: got example markup, can't seem to reproduce
[05:33:32] <scrupul0us> sure one moment
[05:34:30] <shahin8r> can you set a $('.example').toggle function and then "run" this by doing $('.example').trigger('click'); ?
[05:36:21] <dogmatic69> hi all, when using ajaxStart/Stop is it possible to know where the request was started?
[05:36:40] <dogmatic69> eg: add a spinner to the specific text field doing the ajax searching?
[05:39:36] <scrupul0us> hrm... i cant get the jsfiddle to recreate the issue either
[05:39:48] <scrupul0us> ill have to putz and see whats up with further debug in my app
[05:40:05] <shahin8r> nvm worked like a charm
[05:43:22] <Amirh> hi
[05:43:30] <Amirh> somebody please test this link : $(this).parent.fadeout();
[05:43:36] <Amirh> sorry
[05:43:51] <Amirh> http://jsfiddle.net/zpHHK/
[05:44:24] <Amirh> Cork: hi
[05:45:29] <hellothere> ok guys anyone knows how to .hide() something after 10seconds but hide it instantly without any sliding effects?
[05:49:04] <cambazz> hello, i have some li elements, with a href inside. when clicked on ul.li, how do i access the a href inside it?
[05:52:24] <hellothere> anyone here?
[05:53:48] <scrupul0us> ok it must be some kind of loop causing it... if i choose to just log or alert 'hi' it gives me multiple alerts... definitely an app issue
[05:54:34] <Cork> cambazz: by href do you mean an a tag?
[05:58:20] <vladtheodor> hello
[06:01:30] <wa5ted> hopkins83: sry i went to sleep you need something
[06:02:43] <hellothere> i need something
[06:02:52] <hellothere> how can i do .hide() instantly
[06:02:56] <hellothere> without any animation ?
[06:03:17] <hellothere> i mean i wanna pass it like 10secs which is .hide(10000) but i dont want any animation
[06:03:52] <guyz> using jquery.cookie how do i force the cookie/path to be global to the domain rather than specific to the url?
[06:08:30] <scrupul0us> resolved by making a new function to showt eh data outside the .each loop inside document.ready
[06:09:58] <hellothere> anyone here?
[06:11:07] <scrupul0us> @hello there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10386078/jquery-toggle-no-animation-needed
[06:11:13] <seutje> hellothere: so u want it to instantly disappear after 10 seconds?
[06:13:12] <kpl> When I call prompt( ), js execution stops and waits for the response, so I can continue execution and use the info returned from the prompt dialog. How do I make jQ UI dialog act the same way? Do I have to call functions based on button clicks etc in the jQ UI dialog?
[06:14:11] <seutje> kpl: don't think u can
[06:15:55] <kpl> seutje: That is my impression. "open" also does not return anything. So the solution seems to be to let exectuion continue, but set the dialog as modal to block other user interaction, and call different function from inside the jQ UI dialog.
[06:16:54] <seutje> yeah, just setting modal to true prevents the user interacting with the rest of the page iirc
[06:17:28] <seutje> like most jQuery methods, it just returns the collection
[06:39:31] <hellothere> seutje: Yes plz i want to hide it instantly after 10seconds!
[06:39:53] <seutje> hellothere: scrupul0us: @hello there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10386078/jquery-toggle-no-animation-needed
[06:40:34] <hellothere> this happens with slidetoggle as well?
[06:42:02] <hellothere> i just changed $(".slidingDiv").toggle(true);
[06:42:02] <hellothere>         $(".slidingDiv").hide(10000);
[06:42:09] <hellothere> its still hiding out slowly
[06:42:36] <hellothere> seutje any ideas?
[06:42:56] <fabioportieri> you need a setTimeout hellothere
[06:43:02] <seutje> reading the actual page would probably be a start
[06:43:26] <hellothere> w8 copying on fiddle
[06:43:29] <seutje> either settimeout or delay
[06:45:25] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/G26m7/
[06:45:28] <hellothere> that is the actual page
[06:45:44] <hellothere> settimeout on toggle
[06:47:55] <hellothere> .delay fixed it but now it wont popup on the 1st click
[06:52:03] <seutje> hellothere: http://jsfiddle.net/G26m7/1/
[06:54:34] <hellothere> works perfectly thx a lot
[06:54:36] <hellothere> loads of loves
[06:54:38] <hellothere> <3
[06:55:24] <seutje> hellothere: this also works, allows u to retain scope: http://jsfiddle.net/G26m7/2/
[06:56:57] <dogmatic69> I have a jquery UI dialogue that is loaded, but all the button methods are run as the dialogue is created. Any idea why?
[06:57:27] <dogmatic69> its basically a confirm box, with ok / cancel. both methods run when its created on the page
[07:01:55] <seutje> dogmatic69: coads plz
[07:03:26] <dogmatic69> seutje:  http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1635354145
[07:05:25] <seutje> dogmatic69: hmm, don't see anything out of the ordinary
[07:05:34] <dogmatic69> ye
[07:05:39] <seutje> xcept you're  returning false before the function is all done, but that seems unrelated
[07:05:45] <dogmatic69> it is strange
[07:06:10] <dogmatic69> well that code logs both the debug calls when the dialogue opens...
[07:06:14] <dogmatic69> which is the problem
[07:06:23] <dogmatic69> its running both without clicking anything
[07:07:17] <seutje> dogmatic69: I'm a bit confused though, you seem to initialize it on click, but specify autoOpen to false
[07:07:43] <dogmatic69> seutje:  that was just random messing about to see what is going on.
[07:08:46] <seutje> then it's usually better to .dialog with autoOpen to false outside the click handler, and then on the click handler just .dialog('open')
[07:08:55] <seutje> but again, probably unrelated
[07:09:41] <hellothere> seutje: is there any way to make it also when i press the readmore to point me on the new div that opened just now?
[07:09:58] <seutje> hellothere: "point you to"?
[07:10:12] <seutje> if it's tabIndexed, you can .focus()
[07:10:13] <dogmatic69> seutje:  the problem is that it is running all the button callbacks the moment the dialogue is initialised.
[07:10:14] <hellothere> i mean on the explorer, point him down
[07:10:15] <seutje> ... I think
[07:10:29] <seutje> hellothere: you mean scroll down to that bit?
[07:10:40] <seutje> give it an ID and set window.location.hash
[07:10:56] <seutje> dogmatic69: yeah, I understand, just trying to think of reasons
[07:11:24] <hellothere> yes
[07:11:27] <hellothere> i just removed the
[07:11:27] <hellothere>         return false;
[07:11:30] <hellothere> and it works properly
[07:11:33] <seutje> also, this $('#' + $this.attr('id')) seems a lot like just $this
[07:11:45] <hellothere> now the only problem i have is that i got a problem with the hide button
[07:11:49] <seutje> like, u could keep chaining that infinitely :D
[07:12:20] <seutje> $('#' + $('#' + $this.attr('id')).attr('id')) ...
[07:13:34] <hellothere> seutje: can we make on this http://jsfiddle.net/G26m7/1/ the hide button to work ?
[07:14:48] <dogmatic69> seutje:  I changed the code to $(document).on(....) and then it triggers each callback 10+ times when the dialogue opens
[07:19:16] <seutje> hellothere: http://jsfiddle.net/G26m7/4/
[07:19:28] <hellothere> thx very much seutje :)
[07:19:32] <seutje> hellothere: makes both show_hide buttons act as a toggler
[07:19:46] <seutje> whilst also returning to the hidden state after 1 second
[07:20:04] <seutje> the fake prop is just a way to use animate as a scope-aware setTimeout
[07:20:12] <seutje> it's bad, I know :P
[07:21:49] <hellothere> haha nah its all good
[07:21:57] <hellothere> if i didnt had u i would be searching for hours and hours and hours
[07:22:04] <s3shs> Hello, I'm stuck.  I have a $.post() that's not returning anything to always/fail/done after the first time the page loads in a fresh window.  Works fine after a reload and every time after that.  Any ideas what I can start trying?
[07:22:44] <s3shs> And actually, that first time that does not work, it's causing a page refresh.  I'm quite stumped.
[07:24:07] <dogmatic69> seutje:  ok, got some more... if there is X number of buttons with that remove class that matches the dialogue opener it runs the methods X times
[07:24:28] <dogmatic69> seems like some problem with the selector
[07:25:52] <seutje> dogmatic69: hmmmz yeah
[07:27:39] <seutje> dogmatic69: not using bootstrap, are you?
[07:27:46] <dogmatic69> yes
[07:28:00] <dogmatic69> I am :/
[07:29:30] <hellothere> seutje: do u know anything about .cycle ?
[07:29:45] <seutje> dogmatic69: I think they might be conflicting
[07:30:08] <dogmatic69> seutje:  it was working fine this morning.
[07:30:11] <seutje> dogmatic69: could already be fixed in the version ur using, but can't rly make sure https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/6094
[07:30:17] <seutje> oh, might weird
[07:30:26] <seutje> did you timebomb your own app? :P
[07:30:32] <seutje> hellothere: sure
[07:30:43] <seutje> it's probably my go-to slideshow
[07:32:01] <hellothere> well how can i http://jsfiddle.net/G26m7/5/ make this pause on hover ?
[07:33:46] <hellothere> for example pause this carousel for 10seconds on hover and then return
[07:36:02] <scar> im trying to listen for an on CLICK, but  i want to override/stop that click and do something else if they are CTRL-clicking: http://pastebin.com/grQ0qMkj
[07:36:04] <scar> any ideas?
[07:36:27] <amph1bius> hellothere: can you give us a complete example ?
[07:37:48] <manus> Hi, all. I have a quick, hopefully easy question--how is the .has() method supposed to work? I've been using jQuery for quite a while but never really noticed or used .has. Read the API page and did some tests, and it seems possibly broken? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[07:38:04] <manus> Example: $('<a 1></a><a 2><span></span></a><a 3></a>').filter('a').has('span')
[07:39:32] <manus> Whats' the expected result there? I get an empty jQuery object on 1.recent.
[07:39:56] <manus> on the other hand: $('<a 1></a><a 2><span></span></a><a 3></a>').filter('a:has(span)')
[07:40:10] <manus> I get the expected result there
[07:40:46] <manus> i.e., a jQuery object containing the second <a> element
[07:41:12] <manus> Thoughts? Or is this a question for #jquery-dev?
[07:41:18] <hellothere> just added it thx anyways
[07:41:19] <hellothere> :)
[07:45:17] * manus doesn't even hear crickets..
[07:53:01] <seutje> manus: the first will be false, the second will only contain the second <a>
[07:54:07] <seutje> oh no wait, has is like filter, not like is
[07:54:10] <seutje> ma b
[08:04:24] <manus> thanks, seutje, moving this to jquery-dev
[08:04:39] <seutje> manus: I was wrong btw, ignore me :P
[08:05:05] <manus> no worries :]
[08:05:28] <manus> I just meant the fact that you also think it might be a bug means I'll take it up with the devs
[08:05:44] <manus> if it is one, it seems like an oldish bug
[08:06:00] <manus> 1.7.2 also works the same way
[08:06:20] <s3shs> My problem: I didn't have an action on my form.  So for some reason, after the first load, that was triggering a reload.  I removed my event handler from my button and used action="javascript:mySubmit()" instead.  Problem solved.
[08:33:28] <zizzl> Hey guys how can I target an element when it's loaded dynamically?
[08:33:57] <imjacobclark> zizzl: same way you target those loaded on pageload
[08:35:36] <fabioportieri> zizzl: use delegate if you want to attach event to elements not present in the dom yet, or .on() in the delegate form
[08:35:46] <zizzl> well I have this $('.cartodb-popup-header h1').html("Testing"); but that element (.cartodb-popup-header) is loaded during clicks on a js map
[08:37:09] <fabioportieri> $("body").on("load",".carodb-....h1", function(){    $(this).html("Testing");  });   not tested
[08:39:32] <zizzl> fabioportieri hmm didn't take
[08:44:17] <fabioportieri> zizzl: when the click occurs you'll have to .trigger("load") on the element you just created
[08:52:33] <jcooper> hi
[08:52:37] <jcooper> i have a question about defferred
[08:53:06] <jcooper> nevermind
[08:56:06] <fabioportieri> zizzl: see if it helps http://jsfiddle.net/Kx3Aw/
[08:57:40] <jvalentin> Anyone having issues with jsbin.com? no matter which page I go to I only get the default spinning image (http://static.jsbin.com/images/jsbin_static.png)
[08:58:18] <remysharp> jvalentin: can you open the console in your browser (not jsbin's one) and see if there's an error?
[08:59:34] <jvalentin> remysharp: in fact, there is:  SyntaxError: property name isSnippet appears more than once in object literal
[09:00:53] <remysharp> jvalentin: sod, that's a strict error. It got filed this w/e, and we've got a fix in the pipeline to go live either tonight or tomorrow AM (uk time)
[09:01:16] <remysharp> jvalentin: what browser and OS are you running? I've not been able to personally reproduce it yet.
[09:02:12] <jvalentin> remysharp: It fails on my PC on chrome, but works on PC firefox. Fails on both on mac
[09:02:30] <jvalentin> also fails on safari
[09:02:53] <remysharp> Mavericks or a difference OS?
[09:03:24] <BillCriswell> I can't replicate the error if that means anything. Could be a weird DNS issue?
[09:03:27] <jvalentin> OSx 10.8.5
[09:03:44] <jvalentin> but it works on my PC Firefox
[09:03:55] <Uhkis> works fine on windows firefox and chrome
[09:05:13] <remysharp> jvalentin: yeah, Firefox is allowing some strict rules to get through apparently. I'll update my machine (I'm on 10.8.4) - if I can push the fix tonight (UK time) I will do. It's this issue if you want to track it: https://github.com/remy/jsbin/issues/1009
[09:05:14] <jcooper> why isnt this working
[09:05:14] <jcooper> $.when(whenmusic,whenmovies,useridreq).done(function( a1, a2,userid ) { alert(userid); });
[09:06:20] <remysharp> jvalentin: actually, reverting the issue will be quicker. Gimme 10 minutes or so.
[09:08:26] <jcooper> is anyone here
[09:09:00] <shoky> jcooper you'll need to show more code than that
[09:09:22] <jcooper> can .when only be used with functions?
[09:09:33] <shoky> hm?
[09:09:50] <shoky> it can be used with deferreds/promises
[09:09:56] <jvalentin> remysharp: awesome, thanks
[09:10:03] <BillCriswell> jcooper: Seems all right ot me.. What are those functions returning?
[09:10:18] <jcooper> var whenmusic = jQuery.get(appurl+"music.json");
[09:10:21] <jcooper> its a var not a function
[09:10:34] <shoky> right, it's a jqXHR which is a promise
[09:10:52] <jcooper> so i have to make it like function whenmusic(){ return jQuery.get(appurl+"music.json"); } ?
[09:10:54] <jcooper> ok ill try that
[09:10:59] <Guest2597> Hi, my IDE says that $('#navigation button') is inefficient jQuery usage. Anyone know why?
[09:11:25] <jcooper> but then how do i call it normally
[09:11:33] <kinglozzer> whenmusic() ?
[09:11:35] <jcooper> whenmusic().done(function(d){ }) ?
[09:11:37] <BillCriswell> Guest2597: Are you calling it more than once?
[09:11:39] <shoky> jcooper yeah
[09:11:54] <Guest2597> no.. there are 2 buttons inside #navigation div
[09:12:40] <BillCriswell> Right, but are you doing like $('#navigation button').foo(); $('#navigation button').bar(); ?
[09:12:55] <Guest2597> Nope, just like this: $('#navigation').on('click', 'button', function(e) {
[09:12:59] <Guest2597> euh
[09:13:05] <Guest2597> $('#navigation button').on('click', function(e) {
[09:13:07] <Guest2597> like that
[09:13:20] <Guest2597> only event in the code
[09:13:30] <zizzl> fabioportieri still failing
[09:13:36] <Uhkis> Guest2597: what ide is that
[09:13:38] <Guest2597> Same here: var sliderUL = $('#slider ul');
[09:13:42] <Guest2597> PHPStorm
[09:14:03] <BillCriswell> It sounds like it's just being a butt hole.
[09:14:10] <fabioportieri> zizzl: link your attempt to me
[09:14:19] <Guest2597> Maybe it's right
[09:14:58] <Guest2597> I found it: http://24ways.org/2011/your-jquery-now-with-less-suck/
[09:15:07] <Guest2597> $("#id p");
[09:15:07] <Guest2597> $("#id").find("p");
[09:15:07] <Guest2597> Would it surprise you to learn that the second way can be more than twice as fast as the first? Knowing which selectors outperform others (and why) is a pretty key building block in making sure your code runs well and doesn’t frustrate your users waiting for things to happen.
[09:15:10] <BillCriswell> Are there any other buttons on the page besides the ones in #navigation? Not sure if it's smart enough to detect that.
[09:15:28] <jcooper> so you know how $.when fires if all of them are successful
[09:15:32] <zizzl> fabioportieri you don't accept pm huh
[09:15:36] <jcooper> is there any shortcut to fire if any one of them is successful
[09:15:51] <fabioportieri> zizzl: i read your pm but didn't manage to get your issue
[09:15:52] <jcooper> but once they are all done trying
[09:18:09] <shoky> jcooper nope
[09:18:32] <zizzl> fabioportier, so I'm trying to target those pop ups when you click the yellow circles, (all of them are populated by data in a table) some of those "symptoms" are empty so I'd like to find that and replace the text, for now I can just try to target that area regardless of if its empty...
[09:18:58] <zizzl> So basically for testing I'd like to get an alert to pop up when the "popup" loads
[09:19:34] <jcooper> so now i have function userid(){ return jQuery.get(appurl+"get_userid.php?d="+deviceid);   }
[09:19:45] <jcooper> jQuery.when(whenmusic(),whenmovies(),userid()).done(function(a,b,c) { alert(c);
[09:19:58] <jcooper> but i want userid to return the actual data, not an object
[09:20:00] <jcooper> god this is confusing
[09:21:09] <jcooper> is it c.resp i want?
[09:23:28] <amcsi_work> are the contexts retained when using $.Callbacks?
[09:24:54] <jcooper> well i could figure it out myself if there was a way to var_dump the object
[09:25:01] <jcooper> is there any way to do that in javascript
[09:25:07] <jcooper> .toString() doesn tseem to work
[09:25:12] <amcsi_work> I have a large object with a propery of someProperty: reusableCallback, and I want to add custom functionality by someProperty: (new $.Callbacks).add(resusableCallback).add(function () { ... }), and I want to make sure reusableCallback still works with its expected context
[09:25:38] <BillCriswell> jcooper: console.log();
[09:25:46] <BillCriswell> take a look at this though: http://jsfiddle.net/ZDP9R/
[09:26:25] <jcooper> hey thank you
[09:27:58] <syncsys_> hi
[09:28:24] <amcsi_work> oh wait, what I said won't work at all, because $.Callbacks instances aren't invokable
[09:29:00] <amcsi_work> how do I add a function to a function in jquery? (not in the strict js sense of course)
[09:29:22] <syncsys_> I have many forms on a page. I do not want the page to refresh on a submit but do some ajax form submit, show some icon (as processing) untill the reply comes. the reply would create an other icon of success of failure. How can I do that. I just need a strategy?
[09:29:36] <jcooper> bill crisswell
[09:30:05] <jcooper> it looks like c is an array and i can get my data by doing c[0] OR c[2].responseText
[09:30:13] <jcooper> does that seem normal?
[09:30:44] <shoky> jcooper  yes
[09:31:41] <shoky> because $.ajax's success callback has 3 arguments: Type: Function( PlainObject data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR )
[09:32:15] <jcooper> thank you
[09:32:31] <jcooper> ive just never seen data[0] in jquery code before, so it made me think i was doing it wrong
[09:33:00] <syncsys_> am, hello
[09:34:00] <BillCriswell> http://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/EvIDG whenever I see one of her demos I convince myself I need to take a math class.
[09:34:34] <shoky> syncsys_ you just do it.. handle the form submit event, call event.preventDefault() and do an ajax submit. ask a more specific question if you run into a problem
[09:34:55] <kpl> $("#maingroupcontent").on("click", ">div", function () {}   will be activated by click on divs children of maingroupcontent, also when the divs have been appended to maingroupcontent after ".on" was executed, right?
[09:35:01] <syncsys_> shoky,  hm.
[09:35:29] <syncsys_> shoky,  what to write in the <form method="" ?
[09:35:42] <syncsys_> shoky,  and what to write in the <form action="" ?
[09:36:17] <duch_kazatel> kpl - I think you have to supply #maingroupcontent>div in the second arg to .on - i'm not sure that it takes partial selectors like that.
[09:36:22] <duch_kazatel> but I could be mistakenm
[09:36:26] <syncsys_> shoky,  or I think it wont matter, what ever i write in there, as the .ajx call will be separate in jquery method?
[09:36:27] <duch_kazatel> *mistaken
[09:36:33] <BillCriswell> kpl: Sounds right.
[09:37:45] <syncsys_> shoky,  you there?
[09:39:53] <shoky> syncsys_ if you do an ajax submit it doesn't matter (unless you're using ajaxForm plugin for example). you can still put the normal method & action attributes if you want
[09:40:03] <jcooper> the jquery documentation on the best practices for defferred ajax stuff seems incomplete and confusing
[09:40:16] <syncsys_> shoky,  thanks!
[09:40:18] <jcooper> is there a better site for learning jquery, other than stackoverflow
[09:40:31] <Cork> ?g learn jquery
[09:40:33] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Learning Center â†’ http://learn.jquery.com/
[09:40:35] <fyugjyhv> m
[09:40:36] <shoky> jcooper stackoverflow sucks for learning jquery
[09:40:46] <shoky> http://jqfundamentals.com
[09:41:11] <Cork> ya, so has more wrongs then rights
[09:42:19] <BillCriswell> I'm a terrible employee when the task at hand is dull.
[09:42:58] <kpl> In my current case, <div id="maingroupcontent"> is a child of another div I have run .hide() for, so currently style="display: none;", meaning that all of my divs which should be able to activate the click I mentioned about are hidden. Instead I am currently seeing another div, where my maingroupcontent used to be. The surprising thing is that my maingroupcontent on click seems to be...
[09:43:00] <kpl> ...activated by clicking on the other visible div. Is this the way it is meant to be?
[09:43:04] <jcooper> im a terrible employee because they pay me 15/hr
[09:43:33] <duch_kazatel> kpl could you provide a fiddle demonstrating what you're looking at?
[09:44:27] <kpl> Yes, I'll see if I can reproduce the behaviour in a fiddle.
[09:44:36] <duch_kazatel> awesome.
[09:46:00] <kpl> Though my question is really: will divs which are not shown because of parent has style="display: none;" be able to activate on click?
[09:46:17] <BillCriswell> jcooper: If you're not happy with what you're making let them know. Most places won't give you more without a reason.
[09:46:29] <duch_kazatel> kpl if by "activate" you mean "can be shown again", yes.
[09:47:18] <jcooper> i doubt they will give me much more
[09:47:41] <duch_kazatel> jcooper how long have you been a programmer?
[09:47:41] <jcooper> when im ready to quit because my iphone app takes off ill see how much more i can get
[09:48:18] <kpl> duch_kazatel: What I think I'm seeing is that the hidden div is reacting to click and activating an on click which the div is hidden.
[09:48:19] <jcooper> my job is just "web maintenance", not really a programmer
[09:48:49] <duch_kazatel> kpl a fiddle would be very helpful still because your description isn't making much sense.
[09:48:49] <BillCriswell> jcooper: What you're doing doesn't sound like maintenance.
[09:49:31] <jcooper> i think everyone knows javascript nowadays, thats why jobs like mine dont pay well
[09:49:36] <jcooper> damn you jquery!
[09:49:58] <duch_kazatel> jcooper lots of people "kind of know" javascript, but you'd be surprised how many folks don't really understand the language all that well.
[09:50:07] <duch_kazatel> i still hear people refer to "classes" in javascript code all the time.
[09:50:46] <duch_kazatel> javascript and jquery are very quick at giving you feedback and letting you get pretty impressive results with minimal effort.
[09:50:52] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Absolutely.
[09:53:05] <BillCriswell> I think front-end talent is easy to fake.
[09:54:37] <duch_kazatel> very true.
[09:55:21] <duch_kazatel> there aren't very many people who really know what they're doing, so they're not really sure how to gauge quality.  javascript's so misunderstood that a lot of bad code gets let through because people figure "it works"
[09:56:46] <zizzl> is there a way to do a live check on when an element reaches opacity 1?
[09:57:11] <duch_kazatel> zizzl not without big performance penalties.
[09:58:13] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, how about when html changes on an element? or same issue?
[09:58:21] <duch_kazatel> zizzl same issue.
[09:58:51] <cameron262> how can i get individual and surrounding pixel data when the cursor hovers over an image?
[09:59:18] <Velveeta> duch:kazatel: my boss and i submitted a talk proposal for jsconf based around that
[09:59:23] <cameron262> nevermind found the answer when trying to work out how to ask that haha
[09:59:41] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta which one - watching the DOM for changes?
[09:59:51] <Velveeta> building a top notch team of front end engineers
[10:00:01] <Velveeta> and fostering ongoing education efforts to keep them growing
[10:00:06] <duch_kazatel> oooh.  good!
[10:00:15] <duch_kazatel> it's a sorely overlooked concept.
[10:00:20] <Velveeta> yep
[10:00:35] <duch_kazatel> i'm surprised at how little people really know about javascript, css, and html.
[10:00:48] <Velveeta> there's definitely a line between someone that can write javascript and someone that should be considered a front end engineer
[10:00:54] <duch_kazatel> bingo.\
[10:01:11] <Velveeta> that was actually the very first post i put in my blog months ago
[10:01:36] <Velveeta> titled "Javascript Developer or Front-end Engineer?"
[10:04:01] <duch_kazatel> i'm also always really surprised at how afraid of HTML and CSS folks get.  they're reach for javascript first thing and ignore the rest of the tools available to them.
[10:05:01] <maxmoore14> is jsbin.com down?
[10:05:15] <remysharp> maxmoore14: yep - I'm working on it now
[10:05:23] <maxmoore14> ok, cool
[10:05:24] <remysharp> maxmoore14: then I'm going to punch a kitten to unleash my rage
[10:05:33] <maxmoore14> lol
[10:05:54] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: a lot of that may not be fear so much as old habits dying hard, given that html and css have been basic enough for so many years that anything fancy had to be via javascript animations or whatever
[10:06:52] <kpl> duch_kazatel: it turns out to be a bit complicated to set up the fiddle exactly as the production case. I'll see if I ca do it, however, maybe the following will explain what I see: I have two sibling divs which I alternate viewing by hiding one while I show the other. In $(document).ready I have $("#maingroupcontent").on("click", ">div", function () {}, and then I append some html to one of...
[10:06:53] <kpl> ...the alternating viewed divs, and that html contains a div D with a specific id. Later I show the other of the two alternating viewed divs, and it also contains a div D with the same id as the other D. However, unlike the first D the second D is not child of #maingroupcontent. Still the second D seems to trigger the $("#maingroupcontent").on("click", ">div", function () {}. Could it be...
[10:06:55] <kpl> ...that the browser remembers that the id of the first D is a child of #maingroupcontent, and so will trigger the on click also when the second D is clicked, just because the id is the same?
[10:06:56] <b-ot> kpl: isc.li - â˜¹ TAKEN
[10:07:01] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, any ideas then.. I am using cartoDB which is a js map that populates off some table data.. there's a popup that I want to target that if it's h1 is empty I want to fill it with some kind of default title
[10:07:55] <duch_kazatel> kpl there you go - "just because the id is the same" - an ID can only be used once per page.
[10:07:58] <Velveeta> kpl: id attributes are supposed to be unique in the document
[10:08:32] <maxmoore14> any uglifyjs users here? I'm having an issue with the following:
[10:08:35] <maxmoore14> myform.find('input[name="password"]').on('change', function () { myform.find('input[name="confirmPassword"]').attr('pattern', '^' + $(this).val().replace(/\./g, '\.').replace(/-/g, '\-').replace(/!/g, '\!') + '$'); });
[10:09:10] <Velveeta> that code doesn't look uglifiedâ€¦. unless i'm misunderstanding your uglifyjs reference
[10:09:10] <duch_kazatel> zizzl you should modify whatever JS triggers the popup to appear.
[10:09:17] <maxmoore14> the 3 replacement strings '\.' '\-' and '\!' are being changed
[10:09:28] <Velveeta> ahhhh ok, *when* it's uglified
[10:09:28] <maxmoore14> the \ escape is being removed by uglify
[10:09:35] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: yeah
[10:09:51] <zizzl> duch_kazatel have you used cartoDB?
[10:09:56] <Velveeta> you should probably escape those backslashes
[10:10:27] <Velveeta> within strings like your replace string, if you want a literal \. to be the replacement, you need to write it as \\.
[10:11:12] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: the problem is that if I escape the backslash, uglify does nothing to it...
[10:11:20] <remysharp> maxmoore14: it's back
[10:11:34] <Velveeta> uglify shouldn't do anything to it
[10:11:35] <maxmoore14> so '\\.' stays as '\\.' while '\.' becomes '.'
[10:11:42] <Velveeta> right
[10:11:46] <maxmoore14> remysharp: thx!
[10:12:08] <Velveeta> and '\\.' will actually be interpreted by the js engine as a literal '\.' when it comes time to do the replacement
[10:12:20] <duch_kazatel> zizl nope.
[10:12:32] <duch_kazatel> *zizzl
[10:12:37] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: I'm not sure that's right, but I'll test it now
[10:13:06] <maxmoore14> it somehow seems impossible to get my desired output of '\.' in my uglified file
[10:13:23] <Velveeta> from what i can gather of your code snippet, you're trying to make all periods, hyphens, and exclamation marks escaped when you do the string replacement
[10:13:31] <Velveeta> does that sound right?
[10:13:54] <Velveeta> you want to replace a literal period with a literal backslash period
[10:14:04] <kpl> I know I have violated the principle of have the same id twice, which I should not do even if one id hidden. Now, what if I delete one div with an id and create a new one with the same id, but as a child of another div. Will a click on the new one still trigger the on click of the old one, "because the id is the same"?
[10:14:05] <maxmoore14> correct
[10:14:16] <Velveeta> in that case, your replacement string needs to be a double-backslash period
[10:14:41] <Velveeta> because when the javascript interpreter reads a single backslash period, it thinks you mean to escape that period, and an escaped period is nothing, it's just a period
[10:14:52] <Velveeta> if you want it to see a literal backslash period, you need to escape the backslash
[10:15:07] <Velveeta> when it sees a double backslash, it says "oh, this means i should output a literal backslash"
[10:15:18] <maxmoore14> no, I want it to be a litteral period
[10:15:19] <Velveeta> that's why uglify strips a single backslash, because it's useless on a period
[10:15:31] <Velveeta> but it starts out as a literal period
[10:15:46] <Velveeta> your regular expression is finding all literal periods and converting them to a literal period?
[10:16:07] <maxmoore14> I am manually grabbing the pattern attr and creating my own regex for validation
[10:16:27] <maxmoore14> so when I grab the string, if the period is not escaped, it will match any char
[10:16:43] <maxmoore14> if a user types a password like pass.word
[10:17:00] <maxmoore14> then I want the pattern attr on confirmPassword to be pass\.word
[10:17:17] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/DdqF6/
[10:17:22] <Velveeta> then you need a double backslash
[10:17:33] <Velveeta> which makes the replacement string contain a single backslash
[10:18:40] <remysharp> jvalentin: that fix will have to wait - turns out there's a commit somewhere in the version I just pushed that blew jsbin to bits. I'll sort it out tomorrow (literally haven't stopped fire-fighting since I said "10 minutes"!)
[10:19:15] <jvalentin> ah, np, go get some coffee :)
[10:21:08] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: you are right, thanks very much
[10:21:17] <Velveeta> no problemo
[10:21:33] <Velveeta> so uglify should strip a single backslash for efficiency, and leave a double for intent
[10:21:39] <Velveeta> which is why it's behaving the way it is
[10:22:27] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: yeah, that does make sense - just didn't know it was that smart
[10:22:42] <Velveeta> yeah, written by people higher than my paygrade :D
[10:22:52] <maxmoore14> the special chars I'm allowing in passwords are - _ . , !
[10:23:10] <maxmoore14> as long as I escape - . ! I should be ok, right?
[10:23:26] <maxmoore14> _ and , aren't special in a regex

[10:32:01] <xckpd7> sorry... I've tried googling this for quite a while. I'm trying to grab even elements from a div and put them somewhere else
[10:32:10] <xckpd7> but jquery keeps outputting it as [object Object]
[10:33:31] <Velveeta> xckpd7: do you have a fiddle example of your code that we could see?
[10:33:55] <xckpd7> http://jsfiddle.net/7dXVx/10/
[10:33:58] <Velveeta> cameron262: the image of that nebula? or a different image?
[10:34:02] <cameron262> oops i forgotto include jquery, but it's still not working! http://jsfiddle.net/6HBgh/1/
[10:34:14] <cameron262> it should be the same image repeated inthe canvas Velveeta
[10:35:19] <Velveeta> cameron262: ah yes now i see what you're trying to do.. unfortunately, canvases are still on my experiment-to-learn list, so i can't see anything obvious in that code
[10:36:20] <Velveeta> xckpd7: because the way you're trying to add those nodes, you're using string concatenation, which forces them to be implicitly cast to string, and their toString method just returns [object Object]
[10:36:45] <Velveeta> you need to either grab their .html() to inject as a string, or else append them as elements
[10:37:04] <xckpd7> Velveeta: right but the thing is, is that I can easily do multiple append statements
[10:37:09] <xckpd7> but I know multiple appends are expensive
[10:37:29] <xckpd7> so I'm trying to bundle what I want to do up into one "thing" and then append it to the document
[10:38:01] <Velveeta> well if you append to a document fragment, that's nowhere near as expensive as multiple appends to the document itself
[10:38:12] <xckpd7> how do I do that
[10:38:36] <Velveeta> create a document fragment and append to it like this $('<div class="column1 column"></div>').append(first);
[10:38:47] <Velveeta> that div isn't attached to the document, so it's just a fragment
[10:38:58] <Velveeta> when you insert it into the document, that's when it starts getting more expensive
[10:39:38] <Velveeta> alternatively, you can do something like this: $('body').append('<div class="column1 column">' + $('<div></div>').appennd(first).html() + 'the rest of your markup')
[10:39:44] <Velveeta> er, append, not appennd
[10:40:14] <Velveeta> but there, you're still taking the hit of appending to a document fragment, so you might as well do it to your actual .column1.column node
[10:41:48] <xckpd7> Velveeta: the thing is, with that code, it only pastes the inside of it
[10:42:05] <xckpd7> Velveeta: you see how in the fiddle, the elements that I'm trying to copy and append have a purple border?
[10:42:14] <xckpd7> that's not being carried over with that code
[10:42:48] <Velveeta> right, that's why you would need to wrap it in another div and then grab that div's .html()
[10:43:01] <Velveeta> here's a really ugly way of doing what you're wanting to do, i can show you another one also: http://jsfiddle.net/7dXVx/12/
[10:43:53] <xckpd7> yeah that's sort of what I was working towards... you saw the clones in my comments
[10:44:03] <xckpd7> ok I'm going to research this .add business, thanks
[10:44:36] <xckpd7> it's funny though
[10:44:41] <xckpd7> the columns aren't there
[10:45:00] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/7dXVx/14/
[10:45:28] <Velveeta> oh yeah, the columns aren't there because i screwed something up in that first example
[10:46:03] <Velveeta> here's the first one, fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/7dXVx/15/
[10:46:18] <Velveeta> so the point is that in either method, you're going to have to use a document fragment to do an append operation
[10:46:20] <kpl> Is there a function I can call to send some log output to a firebug panel?
[10:46:34] <duch_kazatel> kpl yes - console.log()
[10:46:41] <Velveeta> you might as well save the overhead of doing that and then dumping the html to do a string concatenation, and instead just do an append directly to the nodes in question
[10:46:45] <kpl> thanks
[10:46:56] <xckpd7> Velveeta: thanks
[10:47:08] <Velveeta> no problemo
[10:56:43] <kpl> There may be more than one on click for the same element? E.g. if $("#t").on("click", "div", function () {}   is done twice, then the same function body will be called twice for each click on the div?
[10:57:03] <duch_kazatel> kpl yes.
[10:57:09] <duch_kazatel> kpl you can add multiple event bindings.
[11:06:14] <kpl> I have a situation where on on click is triggered twice for some divs in a table but not for others. I guess this cannot be explained by me having done "..on("click",...  twice. I wonder if it is possible that one click may trigger twice through the same "$("#tablecontent").on("click", ">div>table div:not(.ae-maingroupfield)", function () {". The double trigging happens  when I click inside...
[11:06:16] <kpl> ...a div which is in a table inside a table.
[11:06:39] <duch_kazatel> kpl do you understand what that second syntax is doing?
[11:07:01] <duch_kazatel> rather, what .on('click', 'selector', function(){}); does?
[11:08:12] <kpl> There is a chance I dont really understand the role of the 'selector' there..
[11:08:22] <kpl> Looking up docs..
[11:09:02] <duch_kazatel> kpl that syntax uses something called "event delegation".
[11:09:12] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with the concept?
[11:11:00] <kpl> I though it means that you can set up the handler before you have actually appended the elements triggering the events
[11:11:35] <kpl> So for a table, e.g. you dont need to bind to each element specifically
[11:11:47] <duch_kazatel> kpl correct - that's a side effect of the concept.
[11:12:43] <kpl> Now, when I do $("#tablecontent").on("click", ">div>table div" what does it really mean..
[11:13:29] <duch_kazatel> well, that's where the descendent selector "feels" wrong - that first one should be unnecessary.
[11:13:38] <duch_kazatel> but i could be wrong.
[11:14:12] <duch_kazatel> what you're doing is binding an event listener to #tablecontent that's listening for any clicks on anything that matches that second selector.
[11:14:19] <duch_kazatel> events "bubble" up through the dom.
[11:14:44] <duch_kazatel> so if you then had a child of ">div>table div" that you were clicking on, that'd trigger the same click event.
[11:18:22] <kpl> I thought ">div>table div" would mean any div which is descending from a child table of a child div of #tablecontent.
[11:19:32] <kpl> But what I described is really "#tablecontent>div>table div"
[11:19:40] <BinaryKitten> any div inside a table that is a direct child of a div thats a direct chiled of #tablecontent
[11:20:16] <kpl> That would be "#tablecontent>div>table div", right?
[11:20:23] <BinaryKitten> yep
[11:20:42] <kpl> But I have $("#tablecontent").on("click", ">div>table div". Is that the same?
[11:20:50] <BinaryKitten> pretty much
[11:22:25] <BinaryKitten> only difference is that delegation means that: my filter selector may not actually exist at this moment, but when #tablecontent receives a click event that's passed through my filter selector, trigger
[11:24:22] <kpl> Could that match a table withing a table twice?
[11:24:55] <kpl> Or could a single click never match a single on click twice?
[11:26:29] <kpl> I'm trying to find out why my $("#tablecontent").on("click", ">div>table div:not(.ae-maingroupfield)", function () {  is called twice only from tables within the table
[11:27:28] <kpl> If I mistankenly had created two identical on clicks, then all clicks in the table should result in double calls, right?
[11:29:17] <jedimind> should,yes
[11:31:37] <kpl> When I do this   $("#tablecontent").on("click", ">div>table div:not(.ae-maingroupfield)", function () {  console.log($(this));  });   the log shows the same id for the $(this) div twice
[11:32:33] <kpl> What does that tell us?
[11:34:06] <duch_kazatel> kpl that your second selector is getting matches twice.
[11:34:22] <duch_kazatel> *matched
[11:34:36] <duch_kazatel> kpl add a class to the specific things you want to activate on and use that instead.
[11:34:48] <kpl> Or it could have been caused by me having executed $("#tablecontent").on("click", ">div>table div:not(.ae-maingroupfield)", function () { console.log($(this)); }); twice?
[11:35:14] <duch_kazatel> kpl sure, that could do it, too.  you need to go read up about event delegation.
[11:36:23] <kpl> duch_kazatel: yes, probably the most robust solution: "add a class to the specific things you want to activate on and use that instead"
[11:36:32] <duch_kazatel> eeeexactly.
[11:42:21] <Bloomberg> why when I work with jquery tabs and I have several tabs only show me the according cntent in the first tab.
[11:42:24] <Bloomberg> ?
[11:50:15] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg sounds like you don't have things wired up correctly.
[11:51:58] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel
[11:51:58] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel
[11:51:58] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : thank you so you by attend my question
[11:52:02] <bberry> if i do $.ajax({ // set up this stuff}).then(function(arg){ // then do this stuff }); does the "arg" variable get set to the response from the ajax call?
[11:52:27] <Bloomberg> Yes I have searched and I have checked very good all to be right
[11:52:37] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg you need to supply a code example.
[11:54:14] <codepython777> The load() function loads an html in the current html. Is there an easy way to tell it to recursively do this? (So any html tags that are inside the loaded html - that request a page load - can also be loaded)
[11:58:24] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 you mean so when you click a link it calls load again?
[12:09:32] <JAZ1976> Can someone help me send an array that I create in jquery over to a jsp page so I can process the data in the array?
[12:09:59] <zumba_addict> which is recommended when pulling/sending data, xml or json?
[12:10:15] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict totally depends, but i'd reccommend json these days
[12:10:23] <zumba_addict> got it
[12:10:30] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 not sure what you mean?
[12:10:43] <zumba_addict> the reason I ask is because our api team is planning to make a new version of REST and it will change the json
[12:10:50] <zumba_addict> asked
[12:11:06] <duch_kazatel> "a new version of REST"?  you mean a new, RESTful interface?
[12:11:19] <zumba_addict> new REST api
[12:11:26] <duch_kazatel> aaah, okay.
[12:11:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah, especially if you're interacting with javascript, JSON tends ot be a little easier.
[12:11:46] <zumba_addict> k
[12:11:47] <duch_kazatel> it's generally lighter-weight, too.
[12:12:07] <zumba_addict> but what happens if they change the json the they return to us? our frontend will break right?
[12:12:16] <duch_kazatel> probably.  xml is the same way.
[12:12:21] <zumba_addict> got it
[12:12:39] <duch_kazatel> format rarely matters - you could be parsing CSV and have the same problems.
[12:12:53] <zumba_addict> got it
[12:13:15] <zumba_addict> so should we put like a document/wiki were new json will be laid out?
[12:13:31] <JAZ1976> I have an html page that has dynamically created unordered lists on it that I need to capture in a sql database. I found a way to create an array out of those list in jquery but I don't know how to send it to the database.
[12:13:31] <zumba_addict> this way, backend and frontend team will be in sync'd
[12:14:05] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict not sure i understand the question - if you're asking "should we document this somewhere so people can update their stuff accordingly", the answer is a big "yes, always".
[12:14:11] <duch_kazatel> versioning your APIs is a good idea, too.
[12:14:19] <zumba_addict> yup, that's what I meant
[12:14:38] <zumba_addict> so looks like even if we use different approach, it will break our fe
[12:15:00] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you could always add a version number to the request string and, if not supplied, default to the current one.
[12:15:15] <zumba_addict> that's what we have right now. /v1
[12:15:16] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict then setup documentation that lets people know what's going on.
[12:15:18] <dlam> how do i "sleep for 2 seconds" in a callback function?
[12:15:27] <duch_kazatel> dlam setTimeout()
[12:15:34] <duch_kazatel> dlam but I'd suggest avoiding that if you can.
[12:15:52] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 you'd submit that using a form post or get.
[12:15:54] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[12:16:14] <duch_kazatel> also JAZ1976 you're making a javascript array - not a "jquery" array.
[12:20:01] <zumba_addict> thanks duch_kazatel :)
[12:20:11] <duch_kazatel> of course - it's what i do.
[12:28:45] <JAZ1976> How do I access the array in JSP? I am calling the function that creates the array with onclick of the submit button, but I don't know how to access it.
[12:29:01] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 you have to send that data back to the server somehow.
[12:29:57] * giustoXricordarv giarda dayamon su dmax
[12:29:57] <bberry> if i do $.ajax({ // set up this stuff}).then(function(arg){ // then do this stuff }); does the "arg" variable get set to the response from the ajax call?
[12:30:34] <JAZ1976> duch_kazatel How do I assign it to a variable in jsp?
[12:30:55] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 i have no clue - i don't know JSP at all.
[12:31:27] <duch_kazatel> bberry - http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ - jqXHR.then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {}, function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[12:32:03] <bberry> duch_kazatel: ahhh k
[12:32:09] <bberry> thx
[12:32:12] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: No. In my case, on document ready, i read a certain tag, and read all the html files in which my large html file is split into. I want to now do it with 2 levels of html files.
[12:32:57] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 I'd use $.ajax() instead of load personally, and then use the .success() to do what you want
[12:35:12] <JAZ1976> duch_kazatel Is there a way to put the array into an element in the html?
[12:35:52] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 sure - there are tons of ways to do that.
[12:35:58] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: isnt load an ajax call?
[12:36:43] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 yes, it's syntactic sugar for $.ajax().  i'm not a very big fan of it because it "hides" some of the neat features from you.
[12:37:59] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 .load() may provide callback support, too.  either way, you need to use a success callback to then fire off your subsequent requests.
[12:44:00] <JAZ1976> duch_kazatel I tried placing the array in a hidden input tag with $("#getDoors").val(lists); but will that save it as an array?
[12:44:40] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 that sends it as text back to the server.
[12:47:04] <duch_kazatel> JAZ1976 I think you're confused about how data gets transmitted from server to client back to server.
[12:56:10] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: true

[13:18:32] <eip56> Hello I was hoping to get some help. I have a script that is pulling a simple success or failure json object fron a ajax request. The request is fine however I am having a scope issue trying to set the status variable inside of the .done() It does not see the declaration from the outside.  I havent cleaned up the entire script so it may look a be redundant. http://hastebin.com/geluhoquga.coffee
[13:20:52] <wa5ted> lol
[13:21:36] <peol> eip56: ajax requests are asynchronous by default, so with that code's current state you're basically queueing up an ajax call and then returning whatever loginAuth.status is when your onSumbission-function runs
[13:24:13] <eip56> peol when I do a console.log(status) if comes back true so im trying to set that status to true so i can do some logic on how to proceed
[13:24:28] <eip56> i can set the loginAuth.status to true
[13:24:52] <eip56> but it still sees the outside as false. I should be reassigning that variable correct?
[13:32:16] <reinman> not sure if this irc channel is active or not, but i've got a quick question. on porn websites, when you hover over an image, it starts a slideshow and scrolls through the other images. is there a name for this sort of functionality? my google-fu hasn't turned up any plugins or tutorials to help me out. any suggestions are appreciated!
[13:32:45] <duch_lunch> reinman LOL
[13:32:57] <duch_lunch> reinman the basic idea is called a "carousel"
[13:33:02] <reinman> lol, that's the only way i could figure to describe it
[13:33:06] <eip56> ^^ indeed lol but id lie if i hadnt seen it
[13:33:14] <reinman> one sec, checking if that's it
[13:33:21] <duch_lunch> that's the basic idea.
[13:33:34] <duch_lunch> in your case it'd be with a single image.
[13:33:48] <duch_lunch> i'd really reccommend not using that technique though.
[13:34:19] <eip56> Check source for maybe a plugin name?
[13:34:34] <eip56> might be and probably straight js
[13:35:00] <reinman> carousel looks like what i need. just got to find something super minimalistic. what do you say that you don't recommend that technique?
[13:35:13] <duch_lunch> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[13:35:14] <duch_lunch> that's why.
[13:35:17] <reinman> eip56... prolly could use straight js, but i have piss-poor frontend skills
[13:35:22] <reinman> plugins are good for me
[13:35:23] <duch_lunch> they're a little difficult from a usability standpoint.
[13:36:28] <reinman> duch, i think it's less of a carousel i want, and just some images changing on hover
[13:36:45] <duch_kazatel> reinman that's what that's called.
[13:36:47] <reinman> shouldn't be too bad for usability
[13:37:03] <introspectr5> I'm getting a json list of img strings from an ajax request. instead of iterating through the list and displaying them all, I want to populate a select box with the different images and only show the selected image. How do I store the img strings though?
[13:37:04] <duch_kazatel> reinman eeeh... i'd still avoid it.  are you showcasing products or something?
[13:37:24] <reinman> lol nope, comic books
[13:37:35] <duch_kazatel> reinman for what purpose, though?
[13:37:39] <reinman> thought it'd be a fun way to show off some of the content inside if the user hovers over the title
[13:37:50] <reinman> not title, cover image
[13:38:04] <reinman> hacking out a directory for comics
[13:38:10] <duch_kazatel> timo that's not a good idea - you are then deciding for them when the image should change, forcing them to wait to look at whatever image they wanted.
[13:38:17] <duch_kazatel> err, reinman
[13:38:30] <eip56> dutch_kazatel maybe store them in an object and call the index when the pic is to be displayed ?
[13:38:38] <eip56> and or array
[13:39:09] <duch_kazatel> that part is irrelevant, imo.  the "smart" way would be to have your main image, then a series of smaller images below - let users click thew smaller images to swap out the main one.
[13:39:27] <reinman> duch, im definately doing that on the individual comic book pages
[13:39:32] <duch_kazatel> that way users control when they want the image to change.
[13:39:50] <duch_kazatel> but the automated carousel concept never really works all that well IMO.
[13:40:16] <reinman> on business websites, definately. but wouldn't you agree that carousel effect on porn websites are pretty handy?
[13:40:25] <duch_kazatel> i don't really use porn websites.
[13:40:34] <reinman> lol, fair enough
[13:40:53] <eip56> LIAR!
[13:40:56] <duch_kazatel> but i've never once seen that effect and thought "oh this is really cool"
[13:41:05] <duch_kazatel> eip56 when you're married you don't need porn ;)
[13:41:22] <duch_kazatel> well... depending.
[13:41:28] <eip56> I stick to my previous statement
[13:41:29] <eip56> rofl
[13:41:35] <introspectr5> https://dpaste.de/DY4u Could someone please help me with this? I need to store some data from a .post() and be able to access it, but aren't having any luck
[13:41:38] <reinman> +1 eip56
[13:41:57] <reinman> my guess is that half of americans are guilty
[13:42:07] <duch_kazatel> reinman probably more than that.
[13:42:10] <eip56> more like 90%
[13:42:13] <duch_kazatel> and introspectr5 console.log($($(this).val()).data()); - that?
[13:42:30] <eip56> Ok im going back to my issue
[13:42:34] <eip56> need to figure it out
[13:42:39] <introspectr5> duch_kazatel: that's always null, I need it to be the <img> string
[13:42:42] <reinman> for men, ya. but women i think have more societal pressure to stay away
[13:42:52] <introspectr5> is this a scope issue or am I thinking about it wrong?
[13:42:59] <reinman> kk appreciate the help duch and eip
[13:42:59] <duch_kazatel> introspectr5 - you're getting a text value and then calling .data() on it...
[13:43:02] <duch_kazatel> that's strange.
[13:43:03] <reinman> im out
[13:43:58] <introspectr5> duch_kazatel: my intention was to create a new div element, write the <img> to the .data with $(d).data('<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}'+result[data]["url"]+'" />'); and then access that string outside of the .post()
[13:45:32] <duch_kazatel> introspectr5 $(this).val() gets you a value of a form element.
[13:46:38] <duch_kazatel> introspectr5 .data() is meant to be a key/value pair.
[13:47:04] <introspectr5> duch_kazatel: how can I store data retrieved from inside .post() outside of that function?
[13:47:52] <duch_kazatel> use a success callback.
[13:48:26] <duch_kazatel> and/or assign the returned data to a variabe that's hoisted up to the global scope.
[13:48:45] <duch_kazatel> assuming i understand your question.
[13:50:28] <Laire> Hello, I am new with JS and jQuery. This is my script: http://pastebin.com/8zK0iWcd it execute the checkPwr function but i don't get the alert with 'hallo'
[13:50:37] <zumba_addict> how do you call those small bubble messages that gives instruction when we select an input field
[13:50:43] <duch_kazatel> alert('hallo');
[13:50:53] <duch_kazatel> Laire remove that extra space.
[13:51:11] <zumba_addict> it's like a comic bubble
[13:51:13] <caminante> Howdy.
[13:51:27] <zumba_addict> is it called bubble tip?
[13:51:31] <caminante> How can I delay execution of the rest of a script untill an animation has completed?
[13:51:56] <duch_kazatel> caminante use a callback on the animation completion.
[13:51:57] <Laire> duch_kazatel : dont help
[13:52:16] <caminante> Put the entire rest of the script inside a callback?
[13:52:17] <zumba_addict> or is it called flash boxes?
[13:52:49] <duch_kazatel> Laire your code is very... backwards.  define your function first, then run it.
[13:53:04] <duch_kazatel> caminante your code should be modularized so that shouldn't be difficult to do.
[13:53:56] <caminante> duch_kazatel, I have a function which runs the animation. It wouldn't make sense to use a callback inside this.
[13:54:16] <duch_kazatel> caminante yes it would. you want over things to wait until it completes.
[13:54:19] <duch_kazatel> that makes perfect sense.
[13:54:43] <Laire> duch_kazatel : I put the function bevor of document ready, dont help... http://pastebin.com/UsE3fURF
[13:55:19] <duch_kazatel> Laire why are you passing a function to checkPwr?  what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:55:30] <caminante> Right, but I have a call to hideFunction() which hides the object, I want it to do its thing, then return the rest of the script.
[13:55:52] <Roadmap> hey if I set a url using $.ajaxSetup, how can I use that as a base url when using $.ajax elsewhere?
[13:57:04] <Roadmap> ie $.ajaxSetup({url:"http://baseurl.com/"});, then later $.ajax({url:"rest/of/path/here/"});, with the intent of hitting http://baseurl.com/rest/of/path/here/
[13:58:48] <Roadmap> I guess url:$.ajaxSetup.url+"rest/of/path/here/" works
[14:00:18] <sabotender> can i use jquery to get a PHP variable?
[14:00:41] <sabotender> I need it for checking the condition of something in javascript
[14:00:43] <duch_kazatel> sabotender the data must get rendered to a URL for jquery/javascript to access it.
[14:00:51] <sabotender> hrm
[14:01:11] <duch_kazatel> caminante http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12116505/wait-till-a-function-is-finished-until-running-another-function
[14:01:14] <Laire> duch_kazatel: the function checkPwr get back a 0 1 or 2, depending on the value, it should later do diffrent things (DOM Manipulation)
[14:01:14] <duch_kazatel> see if that helps at all.
[14:02:13] <duch_kazatel> Laire your code still doesn't make much sense - are you trying to call checkPwr and then console.log the data?
[14:02:39] <caminante> duch_kazatel, Thanks!
[14:02:47] <duch_kazatel> caminante not a problem.
[14:04:03] <duch_kazatel> Laire right now checkPwr doesn't take any arguments, so passing another function to it doesn't make very much sense.
[14:06:24] <Laire> check power doesnt need arguments
[14:06:30] <Laire> checkPwr
[14:06:43] <duch_kazatel> Laire then why are you passing a function as an arg when you call it?
[14:08:08] <duch_kazatel> Laire it looks like this is what you want: http://pastebin.com/BxCC6kgn
[14:12:47] <Laire> duch_kazatel: but this also doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/wde1CUta
[14:13:30] <duch_kazatel> Laire what do you get in the console with console.log(checkPwr());?
[14:16:22] <Laire> when i put in in the ready section: undefined, when i put it in the function (console.log(data);): 2
[14:16:47] <derryl> where is the rest of the code for this? i just saw that most recent pastebin
[14:17:10] <duch_kazatel> Laire remove the quoes in your if checks.
[14:17:16] <duch_kazatel> around the numbers.
[14:18:23] <duch_kazatel> actually, try this: http://pastebin.com/aMWquR0e
[14:19:58] <Laire> duch_kazatel : nothing
[14:20:15] <duch_kazatel> Laire please paste all your code.
[14:20:28] <duch_kazatel> into pastebin.
[14:22:11] <Laire> duch_kazatel : this is my whole js file: http://pastebin.com/2duA0L6y
[14:23:02] <duch_kazatel> Laire are yopu getting any console.log()s?
[14:23:14] <duch_kazatel> Laire or are you getting nothing at all?
[14:25:10] <Laire> this is my console output: http://pastebin.com/aQT0UUeq
[14:25:12] <derryl> agh, Laire -- you're dealing with a race condition
[14:25:18] <derryl> sorry, ahh*
[14:25:24] <Laire> ???
[14:25:31] <derryl> you need to put your logic for checking the response into a callback function
[14:25:50] <duch_kazatel> oh, hah, yup.
[14:25:59] <derryl> because it exists immediately after you're calling the $.get, it's being executed before the AJAX request is actually finished
[14:26:01] <duch_kazatel> Laire you're returning from the wrong place.
[14:26:30] <Laire> i hate asyncron ;-=
[14:26:32] <Laire> ;-)
[14:26:38] <duch_kazatel> i don't.
[14:26:43] <duch_kazatel> it's great.
[14:27:00] <Laire> ok now i have to discover what a callback function is...
[14:27:31] <derryl> try something like this
[14:27:31] <derryl> http://pastebin.com/PJm9Mpge
[14:27:36] <duch_kazatel> Laire it's when you "call back" to a function you all ready definined.
[14:27:42] <derryl> jQuery has callback functions built into it's AJAX module
[14:28:02] <derryl> "success" will fire if the request is successful, "end" will fire when it's finished, regardless of the outcome
[14:28:32] <derryl> a callback function is some method you provide to be executed only when a certain action is completed
[14:28:45] <derryl> so it's executed outside of the regular "flow", and bound to some event
[14:30:02] <Laire> ok i will try tomorrow
[14:30:06] <Laire> good night
[14:30:11] <derryl> coo
[14:34:02] <nhulea> hey so lets say I have a $.post and I am getting it to work correct but I have php var that says $passed - true; or false I would I be able to check for that ?
[14:34:32] <derryl> to check for it in Javascript you'll need to send that variable in the response
[14:34:55] <nhulea> derryl: I a sending it in the data I resturn
[14:35:03] <derryl> any data posted by PHP will be accessible in a JSON object
[14:35:28] <derryl> so if you posted a variable called "$passed", it should be accessible in "data.passed" on the JS side of things
[14:35:59] <nhulea> derryl: interesting ok I will try that
[14:36:19] <derryl> $.get( URL ).success( function(data) { ... check to see if 'passed' exists in the data object ... })
[14:37:34] <derryl> you might just "console.log" the data you receive from the response, so you can see exactly what data is being passed back
[14:37:53] <grafi> $.get('wa5ted', wompwomp)
[14:38:46] <nhulea> yeah I just checked my console data is passing just the echo of $passed and my message
[14:38:54] <derryl> 8)
[14:39:35] <nhulea> and since it passed is equal to true I am getting passed 1 from     echo 'passed ' . $passed;
[14:39:54] <derryl> hmm, wut
[14:40:08] <nhulea>   $passed = true;
[14:40:18] <derryl> can you post a Gist or something
[14:40:23] <nhulea> yeah
[14:43:28] <nhulea> derryl: heres my jquery and php
[14:43:29] <nhulea> https://gist.github.com/naeluh/8409545
[14:44:41] <nhulea> derryl: I am pretty sure I just have to check for passed somehow but I need to get the value back to check it
[14:46:12] <derryl> ahh, oops -- you should probably only echo something if they actually passed
[14:46:25] <derryl> that way you can tell, by the empty response, that it wasn't successfully passed
[14:47:16] <nhulea> ok cool but how to check for it cause I want to make sure its true before submit
[14:50:04] <nhulea> are you saying then just check if its empty ?
[14:52:09] <derryl> yeah if you receive a response back from the PHP and it's empty, you know not to allow user to continue
[14:52:23] <derryl> in that case the response data would be "undefined" or something similar
[14:52:24] <Uhkis> nhulea: on the php-side if (check) { echo 'pass' } and nothing else, on the js-side, check if the data back was 'pass'
[14:52:32] <derryl> yeah or that
[14:54:44] <Uhkis> nhulea: and use quotes around those $_POST keys, without them php will throw a notice/warning
[14:55:34] <nhulea> Uhkis: ok cool but I was kinda hoping that I could add my message to the div correct or not correct and pass a true/false var is that not possible ?
[14:56:03] <Uhkis> nhulea: well you can do it easily on the js side
[14:57:05] <Uhkis> like if (data === 'pass') { $('#mydiv').html('Correct!') } else { $('#mydiv').html('not correct!' }
[14:57:24] <nhulea> oh nice
[14:57:27] <nhulea> hell yeah
[14:57:27] <Uhkis> missing one ) there
[15:01:48] <derryl> nhulea sorry i was getting pinged by some ppl. Uhkis is right
[15:02:56] <nhulea> derryl: yeah I got it thanks
[15:15:46] <sabotender> does jquery have built in form validation?
[15:16:06] <sabotender> I want to be absolutely certain before I write this crazy validation on my own
[15:18:34] <beacon> Hi, I am using jQuery accordion, my parent links do not, however children of parent do, any idea what the problem could be?
[15:20:29] <nhulea> Uhkis: hey what if I wanted to check if the function returned true or false could I do something like this ? https://gist.github.com/naeluh/8410018
[15:20:53] <nhulea> then check if (mollomCaptcha() === true) {}
[15:23:38] <sabotender> yay for jquery plugins!
[15:24:32] <Uhkis> nhulea: you'd need to set a variable there and return its value later
[15:29:28] <nhulea> Uhkis: I cant use return true
[15:32:00] <Uhkis> nhulea: on #4 return_value = false; #13 return_value = true, #16 return_value = false, #21 return return_value;
[15:36:25] <nhulea> wow that is awesome
[15:36:31] <nhulea> thanks I totally get tit now
[15:36:38] <nhulea> not tit ...it
[15:42:10] <Uhkis> :)
[15:45:07] <paupl> Hey everyone. I am getting an RSS feed using $.ajax, and all works fine except any elements that contain a url come through blank. I tried surrounding a url with CDATA tags, but it didn't make a difference. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?
[15:46:04] <duch_kazatel> paupl what happens when when a url comes through blank?
[15:46:51] <duch_kazatel> and i assume you mean by "any elements that contain a url come through blank" you mean anchors where href=""
[15:47:33] <paupl> no just an element like <my_link>www.google.com</my_link>
[15:47:59] <duch_kazatel> paupl so you have <my_link></my_link>?  that shouldn't break anything.
[15:48:02] <paupl> so $(this).find("my_link").text() is empty
[15:48:34] <duch_kazatel> what is it breaking?
[15:49:25] <paupl> i don't know, any other text element if i add a url to it, it comes through blank in my response
[15:49:28] <derryl> defining custom tags like <my_link> isn't exactly a web standard, btw
[15:49:53] <duch_kazatel> paupl are you just pushing these elements into the document?
[15:49:59] <duch_kazatel> or are you parsing them out first?
[15:50:14] <duch_kazatel> and then rendering them? - without seeing some code it's hard to understand what your problem is.
[15:50:22] <derryl> yah
[15:50:27] <derryl> paste bin or ban
[15:50:33] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle imo
[15:51:18] <paupl> sorry lads, at work and the damn phone rang
[15:51:41] <duch_kazatel> i remember those days.
[15:51:41] <HowardwLo> Hello everyone! Is there anyone here who is familiar with WookMark?https://github.com/GBKS/Wookmark-jQuery
[15:51:49] <HowardwLo> Damn stuck on one weird problem
[15:51:50] <paupl> yeah, thats fair. I will get some code. I thought it might have been an obvious xml thing
[15:52:10] <duch_kazatel> paupl can you answer the question i asked?
[15:52:19] <duch_kazatel> about injecting vs. parsing?
[15:54:27] <HowardwLo> In the wookmark example, they use json response to populate html http://www.wookmark.com/api/json/popular
[15:54:46] <HowardwLo> problem is, when i copy that json dict and respond through my local host, it doenst work
[15:55:04] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo what error are you getting?
[15:55:15] <HowardwLo> theres no error, thats the weird part.
[15:55:24] <HowardwLo> it just doesn't display the images
[15:55:28] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo are you serving up through a webserver?
[15:55:33] <paupl> oh sorry. I'm not sure I understand the question. I have an RSS feed generated by our cms, i can create the element names and insert values in. I opening that feed with $.ajax, and looping through the result and using $(this).find("fieldName").text() to get the data
[15:55:38] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: i've tried web server
[15:55:40] <HowardwLo> and my own server
[15:55:48] <paupl> *am opening
[15:56:18] <duch_kazatel> paupl so you're not just injecting the xml into the body of the page?
[15:56:28] <paupl> ah i see. no.
[15:56:31] <duch_kazatel> good.
[15:56:40] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo look at the rendered page and see if the image references are valid.
[15:57:30] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: ok wait one sec while i check that,
[15:59:27] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: under inspect element, i don't see any mention of images
[16:02:33] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: if i use the url http://www.wookmark.com/api/json/popular in Wookmark-jQuery-Master/example-api/index.html, it shows images just fine
[16:03:04] <HowardwLo> but when i copy the json response from http://www.wookmark.com/api/json/popular, load it to my localhost, and point the url in index.html to my localhost, it fails to populate the images. However the header is still there.
[16:03:35] <rainabba> Is there a built-in (non plugin) way to reference query string parameters now? How?
[16:04:13] <rainabba> I did find 101-ways here :/   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[16:08:57] <HowardwLo> is there anyone that can help me figure out my wookmark issue?
[16:14:08] <paupl> I know this is pretty weak, but here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/4qvVc/ and here is a copy of my rss feed http://paulparton.com/testfeed.xml
[16:14:30] <paupl> I can't give you access to the actual page or the feed cause its locked up in our intranet
[16:31:41] <derryl> HowardwLo: when you load your page do you see any 404 errors? like is it attempting to load images and failing?
[16:32:01] <HowardwLo> derryl: negative, no attempt to load images
[16:32:12] <HowardwLo> derryl: inspect element does not show any hint of even getting images
[16:33:13] <derryl> hmm, might help if you posted your code
[16:33:28] <derryl> i'm not familiar with wookmarks
[16:37:48] <paupl> btw thanks all. I changes my element from <link> to <e-link> and it works fine
[17:09:21] <HowardwLo> derryl: Hey, sorry for late reply. I'm using this standalone https://github.com/GBKS/Wookmark-jQuery
[17:09:38] <HowardwLo> under examples, theres an index.html. in there I'm changing the apiurl
[17:10:03] <derryl> k
[17:10:06] <HowardwLo> besides that, i just have a local host kicking out a json file that looks exactly like the ones provided by wookmark
[17:10:15] <derryl> 1sec I'm helping someone else at the moment -- i'll holler on private chat in a sec
[17:16:01] <HowardwLo> thanks!
[18:29:30] <k_sze[work]> I just wrote an answer for a jQuery question on StackOverflow. Could somebody check if I'm getting it right? http://stackoverflow.com/a/21104927/432483
[18:29:48] <k_sze[work]> in particular, the way jQuery's .show() function works.
[18:34:57] <jphase> .show doesn't set an animation with setTimeout, it just makes sure it's displayed with display: block
[18:35:17] <jphase> should be as immediate as adding the style yourself from my experience
[18:35:43] <jphase> oh, but you're passing a duration
[18:35:44] <jphase> nvm
[18:36:11] <shoky> k_sze[work] if you call show with no arguments it doesn't queue anything
[18:36:21] <shoky> and you don't need any callback
[18:36:30] <shoky> you just put the code after it
[18:37:10] <k_sze[work]> shoky: that's not what I observe by testing with jsfiddle
[18:37:41] <shoky> well it's still true ;P
[18:37:42] <BillCriswell> shoky: Do you sleep?
[18:38:03] <shoky> BillCriswell sure but not on any set schedule ;p
[18:38:08] <BillCriswell> haha
[18:39:39] <coldhead> he's asleep right now
[18:39:39] <b-ot> coldhead: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[18:39:50] <coldhead> OH FOR GOD'S SAKE B-OT WHAT IS IT NOW
[18:40:26] <shoky> `READ IT
[18:40:43] <coldhead> i don't have to do what you bots say
[18:41:04] <shoky> THIS IS MAKING ME ACT SILLY!@#$%^&
[18:41:37] <coldhead> man if i had ops i would kiq all you dum botz
[18:41:54] <coldhead> i think i have a eggdrop skript for ops
[18:41:57] <coldhead> let me try it
[18:42:17] <shoky> daisyyy
[18:46:03] <k_sze[work]> shoky: How do you explain this: http://jsfiddle.net/k_sze/F8Q44/18/
[18:46:38] <k_sze[work]> Where is the source for the show() function anyway?
[18:46:46] <shoky> explain what?
[18:47:13] <shoky> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=$.fn.show
[18:50:13] <shoky> smth i definitely can't explain is wtf is going on in that gif
[18:50:31] <k_sze[work]> shoky: why the gif doesn't get reset in Chrome
[18:51:17] <shoky> why should it get reset?
[18:51:48] <k_sze[work]> Because setting the 'src' attribute normally resets the GIF to restart from the first frame.
[18:52:13] <k_sze[work]> even if the original and new src are the same thing.
[18:53:15] <kristofers> Hey, i've got a form that redirects to another site
[18:53:38] <kristofers> but i would like to on the same click event, post some data to my server first, and then let the form redirect where's it's intended
[18:55:49] <derryl> window.onbeforeunload
[18:57:27] <kristofers> is this bad ? http://jsfiddle.net/65mg4/
[18:57:34] <k_sze[work]> shoky: Or is it the way Chrome treats CSS changes?
[18:57:43] <shoky> k_sze[work]: calling .show() sets display:block but the image is not actually shown until sometime later when chrome renders,
[18:58:13] <shoky> k_sze[work]: yeah, i suppose it only resets it if the image is actually "visible" for some definition of "visible"
[18:59:48] <shoky> (which is not just based on the css property)
[19:02:12] <k_sze[work]> right
[19:02:34] <k_sze[work]> if I pass a callback to show(), however, the callback *is* queued with a setTimeout, right?
[19:02:53] <shoky> yeah
[19:02:57] <shoky> but that's just confusing
[19:03:26] <shoky> i'd change your answer's code to this  http://jsfiddle.net/F8Q44/19/
[19:09:14] <k_sze[work]> right, that achieves the same effect of providing a gap for Chrome to rerender first.
[19:10:31] <shoky> yea, but without a fake animation ;p
[19:22:09] <T13|sleeps> Does anyone here know how I might force a url into :visited pseudo with js or jQuery?

[19:24:35] <T13|sleeps> I'm wondering if my answer might be in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Web%2FGuide%2FDOM%2FManipulating_the_browser_history someplace
[19:53:17] <kristofers> isn't this supposed to prevent submit ?
[19:53:18] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/6hDWX/
[20:00:48] <scoT_T> kristofers: The button element doesn't have a submit event.
[20:00:54] <kristofers> nevermind
[20:00:57] <kristofers> just too tired
[20:01:04] <kristofers> fixed it, but thanks :)
[20:04:23] <scoT_T> lol
[20:04:25] <scoT_T> :)
[20:04:31] <scoT_T> np
[20:04:50] <Onionnion> Can anyone see why this doesn't work? It's supposed to add more input fields on click of the text and using alert tells me it's finding the object, but append nor prepend are doing as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/44wT6/
[20:06:09] <scoT_T> kristofers: Just an FYI then http://jsfiddle.net/6hDWX/2/
[20:06:22] <scoT_T> first way is most common.
[20:07:13] <kristofers> thanks :)
[20:07:36] <hesco> I have a set of selector input fields, which I want to have revealed one field at a time, as the previous field is completed, with ajax interactions providing the content of the selectors, can anyone please point me at some sample code I might adapt from?
[20:10:13] <derryl> hesco: that's kind of specific, not sure if i could find a sample very easily
[20:10:19] <derryl> sounds like you already know what you need to do?
[20:10:41] <hesco> anything which might point me in the right direction would be appreciated
[20:11:09] <hesco> I'm thinking I can use class selectors to hide and show
[20:11:41] <derryl> yeah classes or ID's
[20:11:55] <hesco> I'm trying to figure out what event I watch for that tells me a choice has been made in the first selector, before I do the ajax query to populate the next selector
[20:11:56] <derryl> i would put them into an array when you load the page
[20:12:07] <derryl> then tick through them
[20:12:24] <hesco> not sure what you are suggesting here
[20:12:30] <derryl> have some function that receives an index (the last completed field) and increments one step through your array of fields (stored via jQuery or something)
[20:12:41] <derryl> k lemme make a jsfiddle for ya
[20:12:55] <hesco> thank you sir, that would be appreciated
[20:12:58] <scoT_T> Onionnion: First of all, you want to be using .after() rather than .append() (http://api.jquery.com/after/). Second, you need to convert the name attribute to an integer.
[20:13:16] <scoT_T> Onionnion: http://jsfiddle.net/44wT6/1/
[20:13:20] <Onionnion> scoT_T, I do convert using +
[20:14:37] <Onionnion> what's the difference between after() and append()?
[20:17:10] <hesco> perhaps .change( function() ) ???
[20:17:30] <scoT_T> Onionnion: Append will try add it within the element(s) <div><span id="newElement"></span></div>, after will add it after it/them <div></div><span id="newElement"></span>
[20:17:50] <ekkis> evening everyone.  I'm having issues with jquery.storelocator.js - has anyone here used it?
[20:19:35] <scoT_T> and also, Onionnion: sorry - didn't see the +, but imo try use parseInt() where you can
[20:20:41] <derryl> hesco: http://jsfiddle.net/ec288/1/
[20:20:53] <derryl> right now the next input appears as soon as the current input's value is modified
[20:21:00] <hesco> thanks derryl, taking a look now
[20:21:06] <derryl> you might want to use some additional logic (like validating the input first, or whatever)
[20:22:47] <scoT_T> Onionnion: Noticed a few slight additional errors... because you are using an id to select, it will only select the first one (as there should only ever be one element per document with a given id)... use the input[type=file] selector instead.
[20:23:07] <scoT_T> Onionnion: http://jsfiddle.net/44wT6/2/
[20:23:45] <hesco> thanks Derryl:  that gets me pretty close.  Next to sort out the ajax stuff.  Thanks for the lead!
[20:23:56] <hesco> let me see what I can do with that.
[20:23:59] <derryl> yeah no prob
[20:27:46] <Onionnion> scoT_T, ok I think I got it all now, thanks
[20:28:07] <scoT_T> np
[20:34:06] <gry> Hi. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_scripts/Guide#Get_the_wikitext_of_a_page mentions 2 ways to do this, but they both involve continuing the flow somewhere different than "on a next line after the query". Is there an idiom to let me continue the flow after the .fail();?
[20:56:43] <kevireilly> gry: you might be looking for promises
[21:44:03] <chanced> anyone happen to know of a quick plugin that can handle custom input masking
[21:44:34] <chanced> specifically, i need to append some text to a textarea and keep it there
[21:46:15] <derryl> you mean insert a value into a text field and then make it non-editable?
[21:46:42] <derryl> or.. wut
[21:46:52] <chanced> basically
[21:47:12] <chanced> i just need to keep a hashtag at the end of a textarea and have like 0 time to spend on it
[21:47:24] <derryl> a hashtag? i'm confused
[21:47:28] <derryl> but you can make it readonly very easily
[21:47:44] <chanced> right, i know that
[21:47:54] <derryl> chanced: $(input).val('My new text').attr('readonly','true')
[21:48:04] <derryl> ohh i see what you mean
[21:48:19] <chanced> derryl: i know that. the textarea itself is editable, there's going to be a string that get's injected and appended to their input
[21:48:37] <chanced> just reading the change event could get messy
[21:48:40] <derryl> so that if I type "foo" or "bar" it'll actually be "foo#" or "bar#"
[21:51:10] <chanced> no, more like
[21:51:28] <chanced> "whatever you type, there it is #hashtagstalker"
[21:51:38] <chanced> wha #hashtagtalker
[21:53:56] <Onionnion> Is there anyway to concatenate a string for the attribute equals selector like here: http://jsfiddle.net/Kb7GX/ (line 15)
[21:54:04] <derryl> chanced: http://jsfiddle.net/derryl/NTk65/1/
[21:54:30] <Onionnion> http://jsfiddle.net/Kb7GX/1/ *
[21:54:37] <derryl> although for what i suspect you're trying to do --- that's probably insufficient
[21:55:05] <derryl> (that was for chanced)
[21:55:15] <jphase> Onionnion: yeah, that should work just fine, but I would suggest just using $('#' + $(this).attr('id'))
[21:55:36] <derryl> because you probably don't want an input field at all.... you probably want some kind of <div> that has contenteditable so you can have multiple hashtag entities inside of it... not just one string
[21:55:40] <Onionnion> jphase, huh actually doesn't work, though, but I'll give that a try
[21:55:56] <chanced> derryl: thanks, it's a bit wonky which is what I was afraid of (ie, select all doesnt work)
[21:55:57] <jphase> I mean it should be the same though
[21:56:21] <jphase> Onionnion: hard for me to test because you don't have that element in this fiddle
[21:56:29] <derryl> yeah, it is wonky
[21:57:11] <Onionnion> jphase, http://jsfiddle.net/Kb7GX/2/
[21:57:20] <derryl> if you hooked to .on('change') you could select all -- but then it wouldn't update until you clicked away from the element
[21:57:36] <jphase> Onionnion: link me to a collaboration fiddle
[21:58:04] <jphase> in a pm if you want, everyone likes to click those hehe
[21:58:10] <derryl> chanced: you probably want to do .on('change') with a setTimeout that's triggered by keyup/keydown, which would perform the update after 500ms or something if the user wasn't currently trying to select text
[21:58:20] <tw2113> jsfiddles are like crack yo
[21:58:41] <chanced> @derryl yea, prob just going to dump it. it was a nice to have from them and it's taken up way more time than it's worth
[21:58:47] <chanced> i appreciate it though :)
[21:58:57] <derryl> yeah sounds like something i'm glad not to be working on
[21:59:02] <derryl> :p
[22:16:48] <gry> kevireilly, is that sarcasm or a term?
[22:28:24] <limpc> i have a list of ul elements which contain an <img> element set to 100% height (auto width). I'm trying to determine the maximum width used by the images, but when i call $(img).width() its always 0. how do I get the width?
[22:28:58] <limpc> (i need its scaled width, not actual image width)
[22:32:29] <jphase> limpc: I think you are probably needing to wait until those images are loaded before you grab .width
[22:32:46] <jphase> instead of doc ready you can use something like $('img').load(function(){
[22:32:52] <limpc> my script is executing on $(window).load() and not $(document).ready()
[22:32:55] <jphase> or even $(window).load(
[22:32:56] <jphase> oh
[22:33:01] <jphase> well then, touchÃ© sir
[22:33:06] <jphase> got a fiddle?
[22:33:38] <jphase> tw2113: you has doppleganger?
[22:33:44] <jphase> ^
[22:34:08] <limpc> hm not yet, was hoping someone knew the answer offhand. ill fiddle with it a bit more and see if i cant solve it
[22:34:51] <jphase> limpc: you're on the right path. that *should* pull back a width if it's loaded. I'd do some vigorous console logging
[22:35:30] <limpc> ya i found the issue.
[22:35:54] <limpc> me durr.  var $img = $(this).find(".groupContainer>img");  == [obj][index], so of course [obj].width() = 0
[22:36:11] <jphase> ahh, word, well done
[22:36:55] <Onionnion> jphase, what was the CSS you added to make the block around the text?
[22:37:11] <jphase> Onionnion: I was just being crackheaded, not important
[22:37:23] <jphase> just wanted to start to make the spans look like buttons
[22:37:28] <Onionnion> jphase, I know it wasn't important but I was just wondering
[22:37:42] <jphase> I suppose you could just turn them into a <button> and then use e.preventDefault() on their click events
[22:37:48] <jphase> but just wanted to make them look clickable is all
[22:37:55] <Onionnion> my frontend experience is very little, all of what I've done before is backend
[22:40:48] <Guest60> asdf
[22:40:58] <Guest60> HI
[22:40:59] <jphase> jkl;
[22:42:39] <Guest60> undefined
[22:42:51] <jphase> Guest60++;
[22:42:55] <Guest60> $(document).ready( function() {} );
[23:00:34] <Onionnion> now to finally get the PHP to line up
[23:12:14] <gry> kevireilly recommended I use 'promises' for waiting for an ajax request to complete before going to a next line in code. It seems a term, with .promise() being a function; however I don't appear to see any AJAX + 'promise()' examples.
[23:17:54] <jphase> gry: http://www.bitstorm.org/weblog/2012-1/Deferred_and_promise_in_jQuery.html
[23:21:05] <Azure> I have a project that I am working on that makes use of multiple linked lightboxed images with overlaid buttons that only appear on hover.
[23:21:14] <Azure> I know that I can use preventDefault (on a mobile device using touch) in order to disable navigation (and therefore preventing Lightbox2 from opening up), however when I go to tap on the document, it doesn't reset the state of the element.
[23:21:18] <Azure> However, when I tap on another element, the previous one's hover state resets. How do I reset on tapping the document?
[23:22:18] <jphase> reset the state of what element?
[23:24:16] <Azure> jphase: the element that would've been just tapped.
[23:24:40] <Azure> By default my overlay is hidden, but on hover it displays.
[23:25:17] <jphase> you probably just need to focus on a different element if I'm understanding you
[23:25:21] <jphase> ?
[23:25:22] <Azure> On mobile, it displays when tapping on the linked image (which takes up most if not all of the entire containing div's width).
[23:25:28] <paulvd> does anyone knows of a carousel similar to this which accepts html as well ? http://www.bkosborne.com/jquery-waterwheel-carousel
[23:26:14] <jphase> paulvd: I've used this in the past:  http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout-shapes/   there may be something better by now
[23:26:26] <Azure> When tapping on the area that the linked image occupies, it obviously starts navigating to that link (or in my case, brings up a lightbox.)
[23:26:46] <amaninacan> OMG
[23:26:49] <jphase> ;]
[23:27:54] <paulvd> jphase: but thats not exactly like the demo i sent
[23:27:56] <jphase> Azure: I can tell you're describing this well, but it's really hard for me to visualize the issue without seeing it :[
[23:28:04] <Azure> hm
[23:28:14] <jphase> paulvd: no you're right, it's that demo with a million other options
[23:29:15] <paulvd> but not how i want it
[23:29:45] <jphase> paulvd: then you need to style it. you linked me to a very basic lazy susan round about. the one I linked you to allows you to do that and a ton more if you know css
[23:30:22] <paulvd> jphase: is there a documentation page for this ? where I can what options they have
[23:31:10] <jphase> paulvd: hmm, I think their docs page is somewhat poor (might be this one since I have it bookmarked), but the rest is css. are you looking for some more api options than this may have?
[23:31:29] <jphase> last time I used this I dug into their sourrce
[23:31:32] <jphase> -r
[23:32:23] <jphase> but again, I used this like a year or more ago so there may be something better out there, but this is pretty vanilla so it gives you the ability to style your ul/li elements as needed without much hassle
[23:32:55] <Junior> yello ;)
[23:33:05] <jphase> "Requires jQuery 1.2â€“1.7.x" sort of speaks to their last update paulvd hehe
[23:33:28] <jphase> hi
[23:35:56] <Junior> I have the following issue (the code is not dry) -> http://pastebin.com/KE8hXg4t function 1 is just a copy of function 2 . If i simulate a "live click" the form fields are not populated
[23:36:43] <Junior> Any ideeas ?
[23:37:24] <Azure> mbp battery went out.
[23:37:45] <Azure> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9143628/normal.png https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9143628/hover.png https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9143628/clicked.png
[23:39:37] <Azure> hover.png == when I tap on the link
[23:39:52] <Azure> clicked.png == what happens after tapping.
[23:42:44] <gry> jphase, that's exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
[23:42:52] <jphase> gry: np
[23:43:40] <jphase> Junior: hmm try using something like $(document).on('click', 'table .mymodal', function(){   perhaps?   hard to tell without seeing the markup
[23:45:29] <Junior> jphase, i have the jQuery("table").on('click','.mymodal',function(){ , and please let me know what do you want to see in order to get a clearer ideea
[23:46:07] <jphase> well it's not that I didn't read your link Junior, I just don't see any of your markup
[23:46:09] <jphase> aka HTML
[23:46:20] <jphase> but that looks fine so long as .mymodal is a child of table I suppose
[23:46:27] <jphase> also
[23:46:31] <jphase> .live is deprecated
[23:46:34] <jphase> don't use it anymore
[23:46:57] <jphase> but perhaps that's what function 1 is for?
[23:47:00] <limpc> jphase: so, that wasnt the problem after all
[23:47:05] <limpc> http://r.profferlabs.com/scroll/ is my example
[23:47:11] <Junior> i'll paste immediatly the thml
[23:47:44] <limpc> jphase: i still get 0 for each element
[23:47:53] <limpc> which is strange, bec if i manually do a jquery test in console, i get a width
[23:47:59] <limpc> so.. im baffled.
[23:48:48] <jphase> limpc: where's the js?
[23:48:52] <jphase> main.js?
[23:48:52] <Junior> jphase -> please take a look at http://pastebin.com/rU8E2LM9
[23:49:01] <limpc> jphase: sgScroller3.js
[23:49:16] <limpc> main.js initiates the scroller
[23:53:12] <Junior> jphase, what i pasted (the scripts work, but in jQuery("table").on('click','.mymodal',function(){ } i have most of the code copied from function 2 , which is not ok.. if i uncomment the trigger , the simulate click works, i can see http requests, but i don't have any data filled up in my input_form
[23:53:51] <jphase> limpc: hmm, things look okay overall - decent plugin wrapper/closure, good events that you call it from, outside of 32 console logs - which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, it looks okay. I'd have to dig pretty deep to find the problem.
[23:53:58] <Junior> somehow data doesn't get updated in the form, although the function 2 updates it. i have tried with .hide() , show , remove etc functions without any luck
[23:54:03] <jphase> well, deeper than just glancing lol
[23:54:29] <limpc> any help is appreciated :) ive been trying to solve it for a while now
[23:55:39] <limpc> the console.logs are printing out widths, which is what the problem is
[23:55:43] <limpc> they're all 0 :(
[23:55:55] <jphase> why are there 32 of them though?
[23:55:59] <limpc> 32 elements
[23:56:03] <jphase> oh
[23:56:10] <jphase> to the naked eye it looks like 4
[23:56:27] <jphase> and to the src it looks like 16
[23:56:42] <limpc> there's 3, but it creates a duplicate of each ul element so it can do a circular carousel kind of thing
[23:56:51] <jphase> ahhh ic
[23:56:56] <limpc> the end result is a parallax style scroller with multiple layers (in this case, 3)
[23:57:33] <jphase> and each one is x2 then I assume?
[23:57:36] <limpc> yes
[23:57:42] <jphase> k, making more sense now
[23:57:57] <limpc> 			this.elem+=this.elem;	// duplicate carousel source
[23:58:44] <jphase> well your _getMaxImageWidth function is definitely being called before the image itself is loaded
[23:58:46] <jphase> that's the problem
[23:59:01] <limpc> but im using $(window).load()
[23:59:05] <jphase> so, on a normal jQuery procedural routine, you'd be like $(window).load(blahblahblah
[23:59:12] <jphase> but, the img itself isn't loaded
[23:59:19] <jphase> you're creating them at the time the window is loaded I think
[23:59:28] <jphase> not sure how this works tbh
[23:59:29] <limpc> bleh. so i have to do an img.loaded ?
[23:59:42] <jphase> but I would guess you'd bind the .load event to the elemnt as it's created
[23:59:50] <jphase> rather than rely on when you call your plugin instance
[23:59:54] <jphase> that make sense?
[23:59:59] <jphase> so $(itm).load(function(){
