[00:08:06] <amirite> i've got a big monitor
[00:08:11] <amirite> it's 23"
[00:08:13] <amirite> LED
[00:08:15] <amirite> 1920x1080
[00:08:18] <amirite> that makes me cool
[00:08:43] <grafi> LED
[00:08:47] <grafi> wow
[00:23:06] <seba4> any guys uses 2500x resolution ?
[00:26:04] <intelligentfool> hey, can anyone help me understand why i'm not getting foo on the console? http://pastebin.com/Fq8VYcCx
[00:27:07] <tw2113> do you have any elements with a class of radio?
[00:27:31] <tw2113> that also have an ID attribute
[00:28:01] <tw2113> eh, guess that part inside isn't as important for getting to the console.log
[00:28:07] <intelligentfool> yea, the first function is working, i'm just just trying to understand the console part
[00:28:25] <myndzi> is there a method akin to filter or map or something that will divide a set into two depending on some condition?
[00:28:27] <intelligentfool> nm that i'm referencing classes with an ID variable :)
[00:33:44] <Cork> intelligentfool: click doesn't take two callback functions
[00:33:54] <Cork> if that is your question
[00:34:10] <intelligentfool> yea, i think so
[00:34:27] <d8bhatta> Hello Guys, I  need jquery plugin for scrolling images on the base of selection of radio button i.e. if Radio button (blue) is clicked, scroll bar images should be replaced with blue images, same thing with other radio buttons. I have successfully implemeted scroll bar with only one kind of images but it looks hard to change the scrolling images on the base of selection of radio button
[00:35:22] <d8bhatta> I tried modifying lib but not success yet...I would appreciate any ideas or link that may help me to come out from this
[00:36:53] <ankr> intelligentfool,  $(document).ready() is equivalent to $(); <<< You use both in your example. (Not the problem though)
[00:38:22] <intelligentfool> ankr, where do i use $()? line 3?
[00:38:34] <intelligentfool> i'm just learning javascript/jquery
[00:38:40] <Cork> intelligentfool: like 2 and line 3 is the same thing
[00:38:40] <ankr> intelligentfool, yes
[00:38:56] <intelligentfool> ah, good to know
[00:38:57] <intelligentfool> thanks
[00:39:21] <ankr> intelligentfool, yw :) - Are you expecting the console.log when you click .radio ?
[00:39:50] <intelligentfool> no, i was trying to find out where to stick other code i want to run when the page loads
[00:39:56] <intelligentfool> got it now though
[00:40:25] <ankr> intelligentfool, good :)
[00:42:19] * O_O slaps O_O around a bit with a large trout
[00:58:45] <tomo> JQM is more likely for smartphones rather than tablet devices, correct?
[01:00:31] <kristofers> Is .live() the best choice in traversing a dynamic tag ?
[01:00:38] <Cork> no
[01:00:53] <Cork> live is the worst option, its deprecated in < 1.9 and remove from there on
[01:00:57] <kristofers> cause my code is not working on dynamic anchor tags added after DOM init
[01:01:01] <Cork> use .delegate or .on
[01:02:13] * tw2113 punches custom permalink rules in the nutsack
[01:10:01] <Trisox> Cork: o/
[01:10:18] <Cork> Trisox: you like doing that every day?
[01:10:33] <Trisox> no wasnt here like a week or more
[01:10:43] <Cork> heh ok
[01:10:44] <Trisox> still find it funny :D
[01:10:55] <Cork> ~~~~~~~\o
[01:11:02] <Trisox> got key to my new house so lot of handy men work to be done
[01:11:50] <Cork> ah, its always a nice feeling to get the keys to the new apartment/house
[01:11:59] <Trisox> yea
[01:12:23] <Trisox> but always so much to be done
[01:12:28] <Cork> ya
[01:13:50] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/yRwfR/1/
[01:15:17] <kristofers> What am i doing wrong ?
[01:16:07] <Clex> kristofers: what are you expecting?
[01:16:31] <Cork> kristofers: one sec let me correct it
[01:17:31] <kristofers> The new row that's added, the + doesn't work
[01:17:55] <Clex> You need to use "live".
[01:17:57] <Cork> kristofers: http://jsfiddle.net/yRwfR/2/
[01:17:59] <Cork> Clex: no
[01:18:03] <Cork> live is deprecated
[01:18:20] <Cork> uh sorry, was deprecated, is removed
[01:18:24] <evilaim> I'mma be a dady!
[01:18:30] <evilaim> congrats to me right meow!
[01:18:40] <Clex> Cork: so it's "on" now?
[01:18:56] <Cork> Clex: its rather delegate
[01:19:04] <kristofers> thanks Cork
[01:19:09] <Cork> on is the combinations of all the selector forms
[01:19:26] <Cork> it can do both bind and delegate
[01:19:43] <Cork> kristofers: np
[01:20:19] <Cork> Clex: simply put, live is an old syntax form that isn't supported at all anymore
[01:20:26] <Cork> (for a good reason)
[01:20:41] <Cork> but delegate can do the same thing
[01:20:45] <kristofers> I'm not asking for the solution, but instead of having this + on each line i was thinking of doing something like if you hover one row
[01:20:56] <kristofers> a + and a - appears
[01:21:06] <kristofers> so the one that you hover if you click on the - it deletes that one
[01:21:39] <Cork> kristofers: what you did was finding all the elements that exist when the page loads, then loop that list, and from that bind an event listener to each new list with the click event listener
[01:21:50] <Cork> and then from there append a new element when its clicked
[01:22:16] <Cork> that means that every element has to have its own listener, and as soon as you add a new element it won't react to that click
[01:22:30] <kristofers> yeah i was reading something about that and found live
[01:22:38] <Cork> ?.delegate
[01:22:39] <kristofers> and they listed on and delegate but then i went to sleep
[01:23:05] <Cork> kristofers: instead you add an event handler to a parent, and ask it to listen for bubbling events from children matching a selector you give it
[01:23:14] <Cork> thats what the code i gave you did
[01:23:57] <Cork> kristofers: just to make one point clear $('selector').each(function() { $(this).click(function() {}); }); is the same thing as doing $('selector').click(function() {})
[01:24:06] <Cork> except its a lot more work for the browser to do
[01:25:09] <kristofers> yeah i just got mixed up
[01:25:18] <kristofers> between the .ready and the .on
[01:25:48] <kristofers> i mean the fact that what's not on dom load can't be reached without .on
[01:25:55] <kristofers> which is why i started mixing .each in this business :P
[01:28:28] <Cork> kristofers: well its doesn't really have anything to do with on
[01:28:42] <Cork> its $() that can't find anything thats no in the dom
[01:37:10] <krz> better to put the dom load stuff first or after?
[01:38:13] <Cork> after what?
[01:38:25] <Cork> *first or after what
[01:50:53] <Guest87937> hi guys I am using the select2 plugin with the multiple property set to true; when i add an item to the list and removed it from the dropdown the item is not been removed from the hidden list. Has anybody experience that before?
[01:51:11] <Guest87937> I am making ajax calls to the server
[02:03:10] <zulu-gula> how to validate input with name: option[something] ?
[02:03:23] <zulu-gula> it works if the name is simple string, but if it's array I have an error
[02:03:44] <zulu-gula> missing : after property id
[02:04:44] <krz> anyoe use jwplayer
[02:04:53] <krz> how does one set the events onTime callback manually?
[02:16:16] <Nachtwind> hi, i am currently trying to get a popover (with bootstrap) to load a file for the content - but it simply wont work. any ideas whats wrong here? http://pastie.org/private/bwp6j59emceaxws231ab7g
[02:23:15] <Stephen> Nachtwind: data attributes don't work like that
[02:23:27] <Nachtwind> yeah.. i found a different solution
[02:23:37] <Nachtwind> $('#deppo').attr('data-content', data);    works fine now
[02:24:01] <Nachtwind> but can i force a refresh of the popover content?
[02:29:40] <Stephen> http://daveyijzermans.nl/jquery/popover/demo.html popover with content update
[02:30:51] <Nachtwind> thanks a million, that page looks great
[02:37:34] <k_89> anyone know if jscrollpane lock scrolling to an area
[02:37:45] <Nachtwind> no idea k_89
[02:38:01] <Stephen> Nope
[02:38:04] <k_89> ie, when mouse is in a specific pane, whole window shouldn't scroll
[02:38:09] <Nachtwind> http://pastie.org/private/va1gcwx9ezyfddxf57dvxq    anyone know why the popover wont show? Error is that Object has no mthod 'ajax'
[02:40:27] <Stephen> What popover lib are you using?
[02:41:06] <Nachtwind> just jquery and bootstrap
[02:42:13] <Stephen> k_89: make that div overflow:auto and put an onscroll event which causes the scrollbar to loop
[02:42:42] <k_89> Stephen, eh .. scrollbar to loop ?
[02:43:02] <k_89> i know a simple solution, when mouse hovers into a content
[02:43:23] <k_89> into an area, turn window.scroll off, and just scroll that area
[02:43:31] <k_89> but i don't want to do the work :P
[02:43:57] <Stephen> Nachtwind: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers
[02:44:05] <Stephen> I see no Ajax
[02:44:35] <Nachtwind> i know.. i thought http://daveyijzermans.nl/jquery/popover/demo.html   was base jquery
[02:44:38] <Nachtwind> got to read into this
[02:45:44] <Stephen> k_89: no lib needed to do something that simple, manage overflow &window.scroll with events
[02:46:10] <Stephen> Policed isn't base jQuery
[02:46:21] <basiclaser> how many active projects do you guys have? I just counted my 'most important' projects and I have 16 :P
[02:46:26] <Stephen> No UI element ever is.
[02:46:42] <k_89> Stephen, yeah .. probably gonna do that only .. but this thing is small part if a very, very big thing, hence don't want a quick fix
[02:46:52] <k_89> eh .. i'll just write a plugin
[02:46:57] <k_89> extending jscrollpane
[02:47:30] <Nachtwind> basiclaser:  and how many of those do you really work on?
[02:47:42] <Nachtwind> i mean, how can one have more than two or three projects at a time?
[02:47:52] <Stephen> k_89: essentially your making a scrolling modal dialog... Dunno if that helps
[02:48:25] <k_89> Stephen, yeah .. sort of , will google those specific terms,  thanks
[02:48:51] <basiclaser> Nachtwind: Im really impulsive, i just work in enthusiastic spurts on this and that, I have maybe 3 projects that are dominating though
[02:49:51] <Nachtwind> thought so... got currently 3 major projects (including my thesis in university) so 2 for programming as of which one is currently dominant.. in the end a day has only 24 hours..
[02:52:44] <basiclaser> tru dat! tru dat...
[03:01:20] <ohcibi> whats the use of an AMD loader when everything is compiled into a single js-file?
[03:02:32] <Phunky> You wouldn't have to care about the order in which you compile the single file
[03:06:20] <ohcibi> Phunky: i see... not much benefit to me 8-)
[03:08:44] <batdorf> cant seem to get lazyload to work, anyone familiar with this script and want to take a look at my development site?
[03:09:16] <Stephen> No
[03:09:32] <Ov3rTaf> lol
[03:09:35] <ohcibi> 8-)
[03:10:04] <Phunky> @ohcibi everything depends on your own requirements :)
[03:12:36] <d8bhatta> Hello Guys, I  need jquery plugin for scrolling images on the base of selection of radio button i.e. if Radio button (blue) is clicked, scroll bar images should be replaced with blue images, same thing with other radio buttons. I have successfully implemeted scroll bar with only one kind of images but it looks hard to change the scrolling images on the base of selection of radio button
[03:12:52] <zulu-gula> I would like to have jquery autocomplete with value > label, and when select item label should be visible in text input and value should go to hidden input
[03:21:27] <Cork> zulu-gula: check the demo pages multiple values example
[03:24:10] <optraz> hi, i have a navigation bar, http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-documentation/documentation/jqxnavigationbar/jquery-navigationbar-styling-and-appearance.htm how do i make it so that it fit entirely veritcally? i tried height 100% but it does not work
[03:25:17] <Cork> optraz: you can't really do that
[03:25:29] <optraz> huh, why is that?
[03:25:40] <Cork> cause you don't have a 100% height in html
[03:25:46] <optraz> yes, i have
[03:26:03] <Cork> i mean there is no souch thing
[03:26:03] <optraz> i declare html , body with height : 100%;
[03:26:58] <optraz> why not?
[03:29:02] <optraz> Cork: can you explain?
[03:29:25] <Cork> ugg missed that the page uses tables for layout
[03:29:36] <Cork> so, scratch the comment, it isn't true there
[03:30:14] <Cork> but basically normal page flow can handle 100% height
[03:30:30] <Cork> but to make a page like that you normally have floats, and THAT can't have 100% height
[03:30:59] <ohcibi> you can trick around by adding top: 0 and bottom: 0... but this had another disadvantage i cant remember right now
[03:31:01] <Cork> (you can still solve it, but it needs to be done in a way that makes it look like it
[03:31:10] <Cork> ohcibi: ya
[03:31:11] <optraz> sorry , i dont understand
[03:31:25] <optraz> Cork: so how do i make the navigationbar fill top to the bottom page?
[03:31:30] <Cork> optraz: it doesn't really matter, your using tables
[03:31:54] <Cork> not sure what you mean fill
[03:32:10] <Gemclip> $(window).height();
[03:32:11] <optraz> i wrap navigatiobar with a jqsplitter
[03:32:50] <batdorf> cant seem to get lazyload to work, anyone familiar with this script and want to take a look at my development site?
[03:33:07] <optraz> maybe i should use the jfiddle
[03:33:09] <Cork> optraz: you mean you want each menu option to adjust its height for it all to be the same height as the content?
[03:33:45] <optraz> Cork: i want the navigatorbar in the splitter left column to fill available height
[03:37:50] <Gemclip> optraz: couldnt you use  $(window).height(); and fitAvailableHeight when setting the nav bar properties?
[03:38:01] <mrHat> ok so i'm doing an ajax request usiong $.post on a php script that takes 60 seconds to process. At some point i want to break this processing by using .abort(). The request is aborted but for some reason i cannot access anything on the server until the 60 second script finishes processing.. I have never encountered this problem.
[03:41:46] <optraz> Gemclip: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-documentation/documentation/jqxnavigationbar/jquery-navigationbar-api.htm
[03:42:21] <optraz> try that... height: $(window).height() do not show the value...when i view source in the browser.
[03:44:28] <zulu-gula> Cork, I'm using autocomplete from jquery ui - there are only 2 simple examples
[03:45:10] <Cork> zulu-gula: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#multiple-remote
[03:48:43] <nFFF> I have one javascript file, but it applies to many pages
[03:48:46] <optraz> Gemclip: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxsplitter/index.htm#demos/jqxsplitter/vertical-splitter.htm  i have this, and on the left splitter panel, i have the navigationbar. i can make the splitter to fill available height but not the navigationbar
[03:48:52] <optraz> Cork: Gemclip can you help?
[03:48:57] <nFFF> Do i break it up, so eachpage loads a specific file
[03:49:17] <nFFF> or how do I handle the var x $('#an-element-that-doesnt-exist-on-this-page');
[03:49:21] <nFFF> or should I not care?
[03:49:44] <Cork> nFFF: the handle is built into jquery
[03:49:58] <Cork> as long as all extensions you load onto jquery is written correctly at least
[03:50:25] <Cork> nFFF: if the id doesn't exist, jquery generates an empty selector, and all calls on it bails out early cause there is nothing to do
[03:50:34] <Cork> so it should be safe
[03:50:51] <SeySayux> With animate(), is there something like the complete() parameter, but which gets only called once, not for every matched element?
[03:51:52] <Cork> SeySayux: no, animate is ran on each match element
[03:51:58] <Cork> so its called multiple times
[03:52:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, is there a way to use keypress(), but only when the first character is typed? Not for the following characters?
[03:52:53] <Cork> uh...
[03:53:07] <Cork> .one('keypress', function() {}) ?
[03:53:20] <Cork> not exactly "when first" but...
[03:53:55] <Cork> alternatively you would have to fiddle with timers and check the length of the length of the input content
[03:54:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh ok, but can that be combined with the on() method? Because it's a dynamically added form
[03:54:17] <Cork> no
[03:54:26] <Cork> one is called just that; one time
[03:54:30] <SeySayux> Cork: You mean 'Yes, you can do that. Use .promise() to return a Promise object, which gets fired once all animations are done. Use the done() method to specify a callback', but thanks anyways.
[03:54:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so will it work on a dynamically added form?
[03:54:54] <Cork> SeySayux: you mean animate supports deferred?
[03:54:57] <Cork> didn't know that
[03:55:12] <Cork> never thought of it at all actually
[03:56:00] <stabb> shit, i didn't even know about promise
[03:56:06] <stabb> that's useful
[03:56:09] <Cork> it is
[03:56:19] <Cork> as long as you have deferred objects :)
[03:56:24] <xec> ecky--ptang-zoob: .one() is the same as .on(), except it unbinds itself on first run
[03:56:26] <optraz> Cork: Gemclip http://pastebin.com/2eMbCCqi can you help?
[03:56:30] <stabb> no problem there
[03:56:39] * stabb defers a llll the objects
[03:56:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ic
[03:57:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Jquery really has a solution for everything
[03:57:04] <derik> how i see in browser a json object ?
[03:57:21] <Cork> derik: either dump it to the console
[03:57:26] <carpii> JSON.stringify(jsonobject)
[03:57:45] <Cork> derik: btw json objects is just a string so it should be just to print it
[03:57:52] <Cork> a javascript object though is that ^
[03:58:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: it's not working, can I paste the code?
[03:59:04] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: if you need delegated events you can't use one
[03:59:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://pastebin.com/8EiGG9B6
[03:59:18] <Cork> ah
[03:59:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so how to do it then?
[03:59:56] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: that should work, though it would trigger on every keypress
[04:00:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah, but it doesn't :(
[04:00:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i click inside the textarea and type something
[04:00:16] <Cork> btw input[id^=description_] is a really slow selector
[04:00:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no alert
[04:00:24] <Cork> uh thats no input
[04:00:29] <Cork> its a textarea
[04:00:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh right
[04:00:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how would I improve the speed of that selector?
[04:00:49] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: though you should not do that to id's
[04:01:03] <Cork> don't use attribute selectors, if you don't have to
[04:01:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the ids are dynamic, I don't know them upfront
[04:01:16] <derik> thanks Cork
[04:01:24] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: then use a class
[04:01:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's like id='description_489987' for example
[04:01:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[04:01:41] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: that selector matches every input in the document
[04:01:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can I use class also with on()?
[04:01:59] <Cork> then it checks for an id ARGUMENT, and then it tests on the value of the attribute
[04:02:08] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: you can use any css selector
[04:02:12] <Cork> you can use #id if you like
[04:07:12] <optraz> ok.. nobody know =(
[04:07:36] <nFFF> Cork, sorry went afk, I assumed jQuery would handle the mpty obejcts
[04:07:48] <nFFF> but in my one js file I have this line: var offsetT = scrollc.offset().top;
[04:07:59] <Cork> ah, ya that will break
[04:08:01] <nFFF> which si throwing an error in console as it non of these variables apply to current page
[04:08:17] <nFFF> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[04:08:28] <nFFF> And then all javascript beneath this line is not firing
[04:08:35] <Cork> the protection ends as soon as you go outside the jquery object
[04:09:01] <nFFF> So should I just do a check
[04:09:02] <Cork> nFFF: (scrollc.offset() || {}).top;
[04:09:15] <Cork> nFFF: or ya, that
[04:09:39] <nFFF> Cork, thanks works now
[04:10:18] <j105rob> will $(':input').mouseenter(function() {}) attach the func to all inputs? still a noob at jQuery....
[04:10:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: with that one() method - will it be triggered only once for the whole page or per textbox??
[04:11:06] <Cork> j105rob: to every :inputs types that exist in the page when that line runs
[04:11:13] <j105rob> thx!
[04:11:24] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: ones for every listener bound
[04:11:51] <Cork> if you bind one listener on each element it will trigger for each element
[04:12:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[04:12:12] <Cork> if you bind it on a parent and then listen for bubbling events it will fire once for all
[04:12:18] <Cork> (delegate)
[04:12:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but what if I use a class
[04:12:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[04:12:35] <Cork> what you use to find the elements doesn't matter
[04:12:55] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: but, lets back up a bit
[04:13:00] <Cork> what is it you need to do?
[04:13:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Got a process page where people can explain step by step how they achieved something... each step has a few input boxes... and a save button below it
[04:13:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so when they save it goes 'changes saved'
[04:14:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but as soon as they start typing again, it should change to "not saved"
[04:14:34] <Cork> why not just listen for keyup instead then?
[04:14:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Because I never heard of keyup :p
[04:15:04] <Cork> it fires when the user releases the button
[04:15:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what button?
[04:15:27] <Cork> keydown > (keypress * repeats) > keyup
[04:15:31] <Cork> the keyboard button
[04:15:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't see a difference with keypressed
[04:15:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> same result in the end, no?
[04:16:18] <Cork> keydown and the first instance of keypress happens when the key is pressed down
[04:16:43] <Cork> keypress repeats with the os interval for key repeat
[04:16:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so I should use on() with keyup?
[04:16:58] <Cork> they trigger before the value is added to the input field
[04:17:08] <p123465> hi, I have a problem with jQuery UI's Tooltip widget
[04:17:09] <Cork> after that keyup is triggered
[04:17:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[04:17:19] <Cork> so input.length == new length in keyup
[04:17:23] <Cork> while its not in keypress
[04:17:46] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: you get a little bit extra latency if you use keyup though
[04:17:56] <Cork> as if the user holds the key nothing happens
[04:18:07] <Cork> there is ways around that, but you might not need it
[04:18:08] <p123465> I can't make it to work with custom message passed via content option i.e. { content: "Hello World!" }
[04:18:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It seems a bit slower yea, but acceptable
[04:18:31] <Cork> p123465: could you create a jsfiddle with you code (and the needed html)
[04:18:41] <p123465> sure, gimme a minute
[04:19:28] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: if you prefer to have it snappier you can do: $().keypress(function() { var self = this; setTimeout(function() { /* your code */ }, 0); })
[04:19:44] <Cork> it a bit hacky but it gives the feel of speed
[04:20:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, tx
[04:21:55] <Cork> or one can use the new modern "input" event, though thats not supported by ie >_>
[04:23:06] <p123465> Cork: here's the snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/bF9Zp/
[04:23:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: I want to simulate a wizard like in windows, without reloading the webpage... is it ethical to hide() the previous form and in the success function generate the form of the next step?
[04:23:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the form ids in the next step depend on the data inputted in the previous one btw
[04:27:14] <p123465> Cork: all the Tooltip demos on the jQuery UI page are using title attribute but I need to pass the message via content
[04:30:23] <Cork> p123465: sorry got a bit busy a bit, looking now
[04:31:32] <p123465> no problem, I'd appreciate help with this cause I've got no clue why it's not working (also I don't have any previous experience with jQuery UI)
[04:35:31] <Cork> p123465: ya, it looks like a bug to me
[04:35:39] <Cork> can't get the content string to work at all
[04:35:51] <Cork> a workaround though http://jsfiddle.net/bF9Zp/1/
[04:38:40] <p123465> Cork: yeah I just tried the workaround and it work on Opera, but not IE9 (damn)
[04:39:01] <sahbeewah_> aint no bug
[04:39:02] <Cork> what would ie have to do with it?!?
[04:39:11] <carpii> have you tried this?  http://jsfiddle.net/bF9Zp/2/
[04:39:12] <p123465> I don't know
[04:39:13] <Cork> p123465: any errors in ie?
[04:39:16] <sahbeewah_> you specified the items option to an empty string, so it'll never match anything
[04:39:20] <p123465> hold on
[04:39:44] <carpii> actually just this… http://jsfiddle.net/bF9Zp/2/
[04:39:53] <carpii> hm same url :/
[04:40:00] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/bF9Zp/3/
[04:40:10] <p123465> no, none
[04:40:11] <Cork> carpii: wtf.. i just tested that
[04:40:20] <Cork> well ya, it works now
[04:40:35] <Cork> p123465: you need to make sure you don't run the tooltip call too early
[04:40:42] <Cork> or you will have problems with it
[04:40:55] <Cork> noticed that when the call was at the bottom of the html section
[04:41:21] <carpii> i stripped it down from the api docs if you want more info… http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[04:41:25] <Cork> carpii: btw $(function() { isn't needed when the section is in domready already
[04:41:35] <carpii> yeah ive since updated that bit Cork :p
[04:41:43] <Cork> and what you have in items is the default
[04:41:47] <Cork> so its not needed either :)
[04:41:59] <carpii> oh, i didnt know that bit :p
[04:42:06] <p123465> carpii: it works if you have title, but I don't have title atribute and don't want it
[04:42:16] <Cork> but it might have actually been the item:'' that i missed broke it all
[04:42:18] <carpii> change your selector
[04:42:45] <Cork> p123465: you can do 'a' if you like
[04:42:49] <carpii> hm i see what you mean p123
[04:42:51] <Cork> tooltip don't care
[04:43:19] <carpii> it seems to Cork
[04:43:29] <carpii> it wants at least title=""
[04:43:39] <Cork> ah
[04:43:46] <carpii> must be internal in the lib
[04:44:00] <carpii> all seems a touch flaky :)
[04:44:22] <Cork> so that was whats why i didn't get it to work at first >_<
[04:44:23] <p123465> carpii: exactly it needs title
[04:44:30] <Cork> that... sucks
[04:44:45] <sahbeewah_> what are you guys smoking
[04:44:59] <p123465> why would it want title if I'm giving it content
[04:45:00] <p123465> ?
[04:45:05] <p123465> it does not make sense, does it?
[04:45:09] <sahbeewah_> the items option defaults to [title], you just change it to the your initial tooltip selector
[04:45:34] <p123465> I don't have any initial tooltip selector
[04:45:45] <p123465> all the tooltip I'll have will be specified via content
[04:46:02] <sahbeewah_> $("#link1").tooltip({ content: "crap", 'items: "#link1" });
[04:46:17] <sahbeewah_> the items option is just a filter on the elements
[04:46:25] <carpii> heh yeah good point
[04:46:33] <carpii> i remvoed mine cos it was set as default
[04:46:49] <p123465> that's what I was thinking, but still does not make 100% sense (however if it will work I'll use that)
[04:47:22] <p123465> guess I'm trying to use it not the way it is supposed to
[04:47:37] <p123465> I mean it's been designed
[04:48:22] <Cork> p123465: the part of progressive enhancement, means there should be at least somewhat of a title attribute there
[04:48:39] <Cork> and thats prob why it behaves like that
[04:49:02] <Cork> and i've had this kind of weird behaviors with jquery ui before
[04:49:31] <p123465> I'm working with Microsoft Dynamics CRM which already is a major pain in the a...
[04:54:38] <p123465> anyway, thanks guys, seems like it works in IE now
[04:55:06] <Cork> p123465: if you used the diffle it was most likely the domready event in jsfiddle
[04:55:13] <Cork> ie don't fire that event
[04:55:36] <Cork> (and is why we have the ready function)
[04:55:48] <Cork> among other reasons
[04:56:16] <p123465> it works in IE with jsfiddle, I'll have to check if it works outsite jsfiddle
[04:57:34] <k_89> anyone got any idea regarding how do i stop window from scrolling when the scroll event has taken place in another scrollable div
[04:58:03] <Cork> k_89: are you handling the scroll event in js you mean?
[04:58:03] <p123465> Cork: you're right, it does not work without jsfiddle
[04:58:14] <Cork> p123465: uh, not that wasn't the point
[04:58:15] <k_89> Cork, i'd do so
[04:58:21] <k_89> i'd be doing so
[04:58:30] <Cork> k_89: are you stopping the event from bubbling?
[04:58:39] <k_89> hmm .. noe :p
[04:58:46] <Cork> event.stopPropagation()
[04:58:50] <k_89> oh
[04:58:55] <k_89> i didn't even know that
[04:59:08] <p123465> Cork: what can I do to make it work without jsfiddle?
[04:59:17] <k_89> was going to write a hack around preventDefault()
[04:59:22] <k_89> Cork, thanks :)
[04:59:29] <Cork> k_89: :)
[04:59:30] <Cork> np
[04:59:46] <Cork> p123465: what was the last jsfiddle link?
[04:59:54] <Cork> s/was/is/
[05:00:02] <p123465> Cork: this is the one that works in IE9: http://jsfiddle.net/QbtCa/1/
[05:00:26] <Cork> p123465: ok, that depends on the onload event
[05:00:49] <Cork> p123465: http://jsfiddle.net/QbtCa/2/
[05:00:53] <Cork> try that
[05:01:40] <p123465> wait, may it be because I don't have $(document).ready ??
[05:02:05] <Cork> exactly :)
[05:02:13] <nFFF> does .on() return a jquery objec?
[05:02:19] <Cork> yes
[05:02:22] <p123465> is your syntax just a shorhand of document.ready ??
[05:02:40] <Cork> $(function() {}) === $(document).readyt(function() {});
[05:02:44] <raj> I have a list of stores that I retrieve from the DB. I want to load them with the page in the html file (since the html file is dynamically rendered from a template). But where do I stash such information?
[05:02:56] <p123465> looool
[05:02:58] <raj> they will be used for an autocomplete field
[05:03:12] <Cork> * $(function() {}); === $(document).ready(function() {});
[05:03:21] <p123465> gotta read a book on jquery
[05:04:08] <Cork> raj: you have more or less only two options, 1. in a form input element, or in a script section
[05:04:32] <Cork> the third option could be an attribute, but if its a lot of data, that would really suck
[05:04:37] <raj> what do you mean in a form input element?
[05:04:55] <Cork> <input id="data" type="hidden" value"<json>">
[05:05:05] <Cork> * <input id="data" type="hidden" value="<json>">
[05:05:23] <Cork> if you go that way don't forget to html escape the json
[05:05:48] <raj> hmm, this seems sloppy, maybe I should just do it with an ajax request
[05:06:12] <Cork> that will add another network delay overhead
[05:06:17] <carpii> raj, why not stream out your data as a javascript variable, which your scripts then pick up?
[05:06:21] <Cork> if you page depends on it, that might suck
[05:06:41] <k_89> Cork, if a scrollbar reaches its end, is the 'scroll' event no longer triggered on it
[05:06:43] <k_89> ?
[05:06:59] <Cork> k_89: yup
[05:07:25] <k_89> hmm .. i need to block that from happening
[05:07:31] <k_89> when mouse is in a certain area
[05:07:43] <k_89> i guess i got the idea how
[05:07:46] <k_89> :)
[05:07:59] <Cork> k_89: you might actually be looking for mousewheel instead of scroll
[05:08:01] <Cork> sounds like it
[05:08:02] <scoobidoo> hop
[05:08:13] <Cork> (or touchstart if for mobile)
[05:08:15] <k_89> Cork, mousewheel keeps triggering
[05:08:31] <k_89> just checked, testing out the scroll event now
[05:08:58] <Cork> opps its apparently called wheel now days
[05:09:09] <Cork> hmm wonder when they renamed that event
[05:09:16] <scoobidoo> a $('myobject').toggle function makes 'myobject' disappear is that normal?
[05:09:29] <Cork> yes
[05:09:39] <scoobidoo> :]
[05:09:50] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[05:09:54] <Cork> "Display or hide the matched elements."
[05:09:57] <scoobidoo> how do i do i do?
[05:10:02] <scoobidoo> thank you very munch
[05:10:06] <scoobidoo> punch
[05:10:13] <scoobidoo> i used it for a click toggle
[05:10:20] <k_89> Cork, yup, thats it
[05:10:32] <Cork> scoobidoo: click toggle, is depricated + removed
[05:10:42] <k_89> i'm gonna block window's scrol event when mouse is in certain areas
[05:11:09] <scoobidoo> ok lol
[05:11:33] <Cork> scoobidoo: version deprecated: 1.8, removed: 1.9
[05:11:34] <scoobidoo> how do i do? $('muboject').hover with 2 fucntions?
[05:11:36] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[05:11:46] <scoobidoo> or click?
[05:11:54] <Cork> click can't have two functions
[05:12:07] <Cork> hover has one for hover and one form blur
[05:12:09] <scoobidoo> what a mistery
[05:12:20] <Cork> scoobidoo: just do the check in the function
[05:12:26] <Cork> its not hard, nor much code
[05:12:29] <scoobidoo> what do you mean? with a var?
[05:12:55] <scoobidoo> to count the click?s
[05:13:43] <scoobidoo> it's horrible
[05:13:55] <scoobidoo> but i am very thankfulling for the precious help
[05:13:57] <Sackyboy> hi! can someone help me with a problem regarding jquery? i guess it's kinda simple, but i can't get it to work. i want my form to "show" diffrent kind of questions depening on which alternative the user have "checked". plz look at my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/yz4mz/2/
[05:14:01] <Cork> var state = $(this).data('state') || 0; if(state > max) { state = -1 }; state++ /* your code */ $(this).data('state', state);
[05:14:05] <Cork> scoobidoo: ^
[05:14:13] <scoobidoo> urmpf
[05:14:22] <Cork> and thats even more reliable then toggle ever was
[05:14:25] <scoobidoo> i note it
[05:14:36] <Cork> toggle was a reliability nightmare
[05:14:40] <scoobidoo> it's very talented
[05:14:44] <scoobidoo> ok
[05:14:55] <scoobidoo> nice to know you
[05:15:08] <Cork> at least that was my experience WAY back
[05:15:27] <Cork> i stopped using it a few weeks after i stated using jquery
[05:15:41] <Cork> found it to do more or less what it felt like
[05:15:44] <scoobidoo> dont state too many things:)
[05:16:16] <Cork> opps started using ;P
[05:16:54] <yogurt_truck> let's get this party stated!
[05:17:11] <Cork> this keyboard starts to be a bit tired, should prob get a new one, some keys is a bit unwilling
[05:17:17] <scoobidoo> jquery is really cool anyway
[05:17:30] <scoobidoo> you enrage to not have it when you just do javacript
[05:17:46] <radiantstatic> Any ideas on where to even remotely start on an image gallery/viewer similar to this - http://www.vitosalvatore.com/#works (click a square).
[05:17:50] <k_89> Cork, http://paste.laravel.com/iQr .. this is not stopping the scrolling, any ideas why ?
[05:18:03] <Cork> scoobidoo: that depends actually, modern js has very much of what jquery gives
[05:18:10] <k_89> even when blockMouseScrolling is true
[05:18:11] <Cork> scoobidoo: so it really depends
[05:18:22] <scoobidoo> yes they try to gain the retard back of course
[05:18:58] <scoobidoo> and do you know how to apply an effect/function to the n-th child of an object?
[05:19:03] <Cork> k_89: its not the real problem, but don't set arbitary values on the dom element
[05:19:15] <Cork> k_89: use $().data('var-name', value)
[05:19:55] <Cork> scoobidoo: mouse out triggers as soon as you don't hover over the element specifically (any child != over)
[05:19:59] <k_89> Cork, ok, whats the problem then ?
[05:20:07] <Cork> scoobidoo: you most likely want mouseenter/mouseleave instead
[05:20:15] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[05:20:18] <Cork> k_89: ^
[05:20:30] <scoobidoo> that's because i have a list of img and i dont want to give them specific ids/etc..
[05:20:46] <Cork> both those was for you k_89
[05:21:21] <Cork> scoobidoo: you mean something like obj.eq(10).animate() ?
[05:21:31] <scoobidoo> eq?
[05:21:37] <scoobidoo> this form anyway
[05:22:01] <Cork> ah you mean you want to do something on ex the 5:th input in a form?
[05:22:13] <scoobidoo> yes something like that
[05:22:27] <k_89> Cork, heh .. k .. still the scrolling happens though
[05:22:35] <Cork> scoobidoo: $('form').find('input').eq(4)
[05:22:45] <k_89> even though i am doing of preventDefault()
[05:22:59] <scoobidoo> ok eq it's cool grat thanks
[05:23:08] <Cork> ah, i don't think you can prevent the scrolling
[05:23:16] <scoobidoo> it's very much happinness
[05:23:31] <Cork> if my memory serves me its seen as too important
[05:23:43] <k_89> Cork, ahh .. okay
[05:23:46] <k_89> but
[05:23:49] <k_89> facebook does it
[05:23:53] <k_89> in its ticker
[05:24:13] <Cork> k_89: are you sure it actually uses the normal scroll?
[05:24:15] <k_89> when your mouse is in its ticker, window doesn't scroll down
[05:24:17] <k_89> nah
[05:24:19] <k_89> not sure :
[05:24:21] <Cork> and doens't just fake it all
[05:24:25] <Sackyboy> never mind, i solved it by myself. thanks anyway
[05:24:32] <scoobidoo> a day to hang above my bed
[05:24:39] <k_89> Cork, there window scroll looks normal
[05:25:01] <xec> their*
[05:25:06] <Cork> k_89: that doesn't mean it is the scrollbar of the element your moving around in :)
[05:25:19] <Cork> thats for example what google docs does
[05:25:25] * xec puts on his grammar nazi cape and hat
[05:25:35] <k_89> oh
[05:25:36] <k_89> hehe
[05:25:38] <Cork> xec: wb :)
[05:25:42] <xec> :D
[05:26:27] <xec> Cork:  you're* moving around in
[05:26:54] <Cork> gah, did i fall into that old one again >_<
[05:27:09] * xec hugs cork
[05:27:14] * Cork hugs back
[05:27:37] <Cork> xec: but i'm trying!
[05:28:00] <Cork> sadly i spell even worse in my mother tong
[05:28:01] <Cork> :/
[05:28:10] <xec> tongue*
[05:28:32] <xec> or did you mean your mothers thong
[05:28:41] <Cork> uh... no...
[05:28:49] <Cork> *shivers*
[05:28:51] <xec> whew :D
[05:28:59] <Cork> lol
[05:29:00] <xec> bullet dodged
[05:35:51] <k_89> Cork, when you scroll fb's ticker, even when you reach the end, window's scroll function doesn't get trigerred
[05:37:13] <raj> carpii, how is that done?
[05:37:54] <carpii> raj, what serverside language are you using ?
[05:37:58] <raj> python
[05:38:31] <carpii> ok well if you write this to the response    <script>var mydata = { hello: 1, goodbye: 2}</script>
[05:38:52] <carpii> then in jQuery you could say things like   $("#mydiv").text(mydata.hello) or whatever
[05:39:03] <carpii> not the best example since i chose to use integers :p
[05:39:33] <carpii> or stream an array of strings etc
[05:45:45] <walidvb> hi guys, i just added this scrollTo behaviour on a site of mine, and i have an issue with it
[05:46:28] <walidvb> basically, sometimes, after scrollTo(#id) has been called, the page gets stuck there. As in, it won't let you scroll anymore
[05:46:38] <walidvb> I really don't know why, anybody would have a clue?
[05:46:50] <walidvb> link is http://www.moijconnais.com
[05:48:43] <walidvb> am i here?
[05:49:39] <carpii> philosphical question?
[05:50:21] <shoky> walidvb: GET http://www.moijconnais.com/sites/default/files/js/js_4c7a5f93e4e28a19fa167fd1da7a97ba.js 404 (Not Found)   and    Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[05:50:47] <walidvb> shoky: sry, again?
[05:51:01] <walidvb> carpii: hehe i wasn't sure if i was online. seems quiet around here today..?
[05:51:02] <shoky> those errors are on your site
[05:51:08] <carpii> hehe :)
[05:51:14] <shoky> your script and jquery are not being loaded
[05:51:22] <shoky> and i don't see scrollTo anywhere either
[05:51:23] <walidvb> shoky: i think i just corrected it, removed js compression
[05:51:34] <walidvb> it's in the load_posts.js
[05:51:40] <walidvb> l. 79
[05:52:03] <scoobidoo> cool i finished jquery!
[05:52:28] <walidvb> it's weird though, sometimes if you force it(insist on scrolling) it will release the "blocking_of_scroll_position"
[05:53:31] <shoky> walidvb:  and how do i trigger the scroll ...
[05:53:51] <walidvb> sorry. if you click any link, basically. on the left, the album list, or a post title
[05:53:54] <walidvb> or the logo
[05:55:32] <sahbeewah> is that javascript file... a html file?
[05:55:41] <walidvb> shoky: see what I mean? it doesn't always do it, sometimes it requires several tries
[05:57:02] <raj> I'm using jquery's autocomplete, but initializing it before the data 'source' has been loaded from ajax
[05:57:17] <raj> because, I initialize it on document ready
[05:57:51] <raj> then, only after the ajax response, do I put .data() on one of the elements
[05:58:00] <raj> which is the source for autocomplete
[06:00:19] <raj> can I make autocomplete check for the source each time it's run?
[06:00:23] <raj> to see if the source has changed
[06:00:33] <raj> or is this sloppy?
[06:01:19] <walidvb> raj: why don't you run autocomplete each time you change the source, rather?
[06:01:34] <walidvb> shoky: any clue?
[06:02:14] <raj> shoky hasn't had a clue since 2002
[06:02:45] <raj> walidvb, so destroy and recreate it?
[06:02:48] <raj> isn't that inefficient?
[06:03:31] <walidvb> i never used autocomplete, so I don't know it. can you have it use a source as a callback function otherwise?
[06:04:31] <raj> oh, yes, it does
[06:04:33] <raj> ok, cool, thank you
[06:04:48] <walidvb> yw
[06:06:29] <raj> if I do $some_element = $('#this-element') ... can I use $some_element.data() in the callback?
[06:06:44] <raj> or will that not show any changed data?
[06:07:02] <walidvb> i think it won't
[06:07:09] <raj> k
[06:07:11] <raj> thanks
[06:07:22] <walidvb> = does a clone, but please correct me if i'm wrong.
[06:07:36] <walidvb> because i'm not sure, just remember this from testiong
[06:08:31] <walidvb> raj: you know about scrollTo? ;)
[06:09:33] <raj> not really, but I'd be happy to take a look
[06:09:36] <raj> what's the issue?
[06:10:39] <walidvb> :)
[06:10:56] <walidvb> it seems it's magically working all of a sudden, but maybe you can confirm
[06:11:04] <raj> sure
[06:11:07] <walidvb> on http://www.moijconnais.com
[06:11:17] <walidvb> basically, sometimes, after scrollTo(#id) has been called, the page gets stuck there. As in, it won't let you scroll anymore
[06:11:45] <walidvb> if you navigate through the site using whatever (album list on the left, menuu, post titles)
[06:12:04] <walidvb> it calls scrollTo
[06:12:51] <walidvb> and I just changed the behaviour to if(scrollPos > #main-content){scrollTo(#main-content)} //syntax is obv wrong here
[06:12:58] <walidvb> which seems to have solved it??
[06:13:24] <raj> I don't seem to have any issue scrolling
[06:13:33] <raj> I click the album covers on the left and I can still scroll
[06:13:36] <raj> I'm using chrome
[06:13:41] <walidvb> great
[06:13:47] <sahbeewah> walidvb, the reason your page gets stuck is because it makes craploads of ajax requests when you click on the album
[06:13:59] <sahbeewah> the ajax requests all of which call scrollto
[06:14:16] <walidvb> i have no idea why it would do that, but it seems it's working now
[06:14:24] <walidvb> hm that's true, i'd forgotten about that
[06:14:37] <walidvb> i don't know why it does multiple ajax requests, though?!
[06:14:54] <walidvb> (i did this a while ago, just came back to it today)
[06:15:54] <sahbeewah> you're also mixing two versions of jquery
[06:16:01] <sahbeewah> one of which is, 1.2.6
[06:16:30] <walidvb> sahbeewah: yes, i had to unfortunately. because drupal 6 runs on 1.2.6
[06:16:53] <walidvb> and i needed 1.6 i think for... let me check.. maybe i don't even need it anymore...
[06:17:05] <walidvb> how would that be the issue, though?
[06:18:15] <sahbeewah> i don't know, but e.g. line 15 of your load_posts.js you're using the 1.2.6 selector engine, and using bind, which has different functionality to the later versions
[06:18:29] <sahbeewah> inside that callback, it calls the loadFrom method, which uses the newer version of jquery
[06:18:34] <walidvb> oh.
[06:18:42] <walidvb> thanks for your eagle eyes
[06:18:52] <sahbeewah> there's probably issues there, but you're probably gonna have to dig deep
[06:19:27] <walidvb> i'll change everything to 1.7=$jq, simply, no?
[06:20:06] <walidvb> and i think i'd prob go faster to update to drupal7+jquery1.7 than fix this buggy website
[06:21:39] <sahbeewah> i dno if that's drupal functionality, but that whole jquery file is actually text/html and gets included as a script
[06:22:11] <sahbeewah> which seems bad since everything that gets included in a script gets executed... which probably means there's lots of xss vulnerabilities
[06:22:51] <raj> does setting .data() on an element convert 'my-list' to 'myList' ??
[06:23:00] <raj> when passing data do .data()
[06:23:42] <walidvb> sahbeewah: hm i definitely include it the drupal way.
[06:23:59] <walidvb> how do can you check that it's included as html
[06:25:38] <sahbeewah> just open that http://www.moijconnais.com/sites/default/files/js/js_4c7a5f93e4e28a19fa167fd1da7a97ba.js in your browser...
[06:25:59] <sahbeewah> raj, no?
[06:26:23] <walidvb> sahbeewah: ... The requested page could not be found.
[06:26:23] <raj> it seems to be
[06:26:35] <walidvb> might have some caching issue, i didn't change all settings
[06:27:54] <raj> sahbeewah, it does!
[06:27:54] <sahbeewah> are you on chrome
[06:28:11] <sahbeewah> raj, elaborate
[06:28:19] <walidvb> sahbeewah: ff atm
[06:28:39] <chase-work> i'm currently checking some input fields for changes via a setInterval. Would it be more appropriate to do .on('change') on the list of input fields?
[06:28:52] <raj> sahbeewah, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L256
[06:29:52] <scoobidoo> how frequently do you use prototyping?
[06:30:06] <raj> i don't
[06:30:09] <raj> often
[06:30:29] <walidvb> raj: that's interesting
[06:30:35] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10722089/997624
[06:30:46] <raj> walidvb, it's annoying
[06:30:49] <raj> i don't want camelcase
[06:30:59] <walidvb> but good to know, though
[06:31:24] <walidvb> sucks if you don't want it, though
[06:31:40] <scoobidoo> where shall i download html5?
[06:31:55] <walidvb> scoobidoo: try internet
[06:32:10] <scoobidoo> i haven't it
[06:32:40] <walidvb> hm. you're connected via telegraph?
[06:33:15] <scoobidoo> some kind of
[06:33:46] <scoobidoo> anyway i search html5 last version
[06:34:10] <scoobidoo> free of course
[06:34:11] <scoobidoo> :)
[06:34:31] <walidvb> hm i'll stop playing cause i solved my thing and i really have to go,
[06:34:39] <sahbeewah> raj, that's a neat feature. but its internal, and doesn't affect anything anyway?
[06:34:42] <walidvb> but scoobidoo: that's not a question, what do you need?
[06:35:08] <scoobidoo> i've alrerady had such an ache to get the explorer
[06:35:21] <chase-work> what would be the best way to monitor a list of inputs for changes (so I can see if they typed in one of my supported command shortcuts)- a setInteveral that reads the value, or a .change(), or a .keyup() , or something else?
[06:35:25] <walidvb> sahbeewah, raj: well, if you need to retrieve that data later on, just camelCase whatever you have as a selector/attribute, no?
[06:35:54] <walidvb> chase-work: i think ajax autocomplete uses keyup, no?
[06:36:18] <raj> walidvb, yes, but that's messy
[06:36:28] <sahbeewah> no you can't do that, it doesn't affect the actual dom element
[06:36:32] <chase-work> walidvb it does, but the commands don't populate like that, they're regular forms as well, i don't want to use that
[06:36:38] <walidvb> hm.. i kind of agree, but i can't see how else
[06:36:41] <sahbeewah> jquery just stores internally a camelcased version of the data
[06:36:48] <sahbeewah> reference to it, rather
[06:37:12] <chase-work> walidvb currently, there's a setInterval every 5 seconds that calls a function, which checks each of the fields to see if the value equals one of the commands in the array
[06:37:19] <walidvb> sahbeewah: still, the data- stored is camelCased, so when you call it you need to camelCase, no?
[06:37:20] <chase-work> walidvb and i think its ugly
[06:37:48] <sahbeewah> no, it creates an alias for it
[06:38:59] <walidvb> sahbeewah: hmm.. so how do you retrieve it from the DOM element? $().data(camel-case) or .data(camelCase) ?
[06:40:47] <sahbeewah> the former, or whatever you stored it as...
[06:40:52] <walidvb> raj: http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ajax_aspphp.asp
[06:41:00] <walidvb> so not camel-cased yet
[06:41:15] <walidvb> so basically the camelCasing is transparent to us. it's internal
[06:41:23] <walidvb> so raj, what's you're problem?
[06:41:37] <walidvb> btw chase-work that was for you: http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ajax_aspphp.asp
[06:41:47] <walidvb> so i guess their method is keyUp
[06:41:50] <walidvb> i need to go
[06:41:58] <walidvb> thx raj, thx sahbeewah!
[06:42:05] <chase-work> walidvb i just decided to use keyup anyway, since no one chimed in
[06:42:07] <chase-work> thanks though!
[06:42:19] <raj> i don't like it
[06:42:42] <walidvb> chase-work: it makes sense, though, cause that's when your string has changed for sure
[06:42:45] <walidvb> bye bye all!
[06:43:40] <desy> hi i have a problem with the $.post function jquery 1.9.1, html response exception "The character encoding of the plain text document was not declared", i declared charset utf-8 in the html header
[06:44:56] <discorpia> desy: maybe you need to decode/escape certain characters
[06:49:19] <desy> discorpia: also the same problem if i return a empty string (content-length:0)
[06:53:20] <endberg> hi
[06:53:46] <hooloovoo> endberg: hello
[06:59:05] <endberg> I'd like to make a jquery selection, but it seems wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/ZAZMA/1/
[06:59:45] <keirlav87> sorry for being OT, I can't find a better room to ask the question in, but can anyone please tell me how to register a font with raphael?
[06:59:52] <desy> same problem with $.get fuction
[07:03:50] <MalMen> with jquery there is any easy way to get the current url with get and transform to get with new values ? for example foo.php?id=22&act=edit to foo.php?id=22&act=success
[07:04:18] <BeTa> hi there
[07:04:46] <BeTa> I've recently upgraded from 1.4 to 1.9 (ok I know I'm pretty late) and I face a strange behaviour :
[07:05:36] <BeTa> when I try some $.ajax('/',function(html){ $(html); }); FF gives me a weird error like : Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <div id="...">(...)
[07:06:24] <BeTa> does it ring you a bell ? anyone's got an idea about that ? (note that if I do html = $('<div></div>').append(html); $(html); it's working as I wanted
[07:07:45] <pachet> MalMen: you dont need jquery
[07:09:00] <didiergm> endberg you have several mistakes : no # to search for an id and .graph_info is not a parent of id 123
[07:09:41] <MalMen> pachet what do i need ?
[07:10:11] <didiergm> endberg, I would correct these and use the chrome console to build up my selector
[07:11:08] <raj> I'm using autocomplete. I want to run a function when an autocomplete option is selected, but the function only runs with the user-inputed value, not the value selected from the autocomplete list
[07:11:42] <pachet> ?eval 1
[07:11:59] <pachet> bleh
[07:12:08] <pachet> MalMen: 'foo.php?id=22&act=death'.replace(/act=.*/, 'act=life')
[07:13:22] <grafi> doesnt work though if act is not the last parameter
[07:13:35] <BeTa> nobody for my curious behaviour using ajax ?
[07:15:41] <pachet> 'foo.php?id=22&act=death&naysayer=grafi'.replace(/(act=)[^\&]+/, 'act=life')
[07:16:41] <grafi> well done
[07:17:58] <pachet> high five
[07:18:39] <BillCriswell> pachet: Why are you capturing act=?
[07:19:57] <pachet> 'foo.php?id=22&act=death&naysayer=grafi&nitpicker=BillCriswell'.replace(/act=[^\&]+/, 'act=life')
[07:20:04] <BillCriswell> =)
[07:21:39] <grafi> BillCriswell made the list ^^
[07:25:46] <serdem> hey guys
[07:26:00] <serdem> would you check my code here please?
[07:26:15] <serdem> i'm having problem with that code.
[07:27:25] <carpii_> just ask your question and nopaste your code
[07:27:26] <jrajav> serdem: You'll have to give me a few hours, I left my crystal ball at home
[07:27:39] <grafi> xP
[07:27:40] <pachet> zing
[07:27:51] <serdem> the problem is; there are there blocks of code. that doesn't work in "order". i mean if any block takes long time  second or third block start to work and it messes up.
[07:27:53] <grafi> oh snap
[07:27:58] <serdem> wait guys. i was writing :)
[07:28:36] <serdem> i think i have to use callbacks or something. but i couldn't make it.
[07:28:39] <jrajav> One's first race condition is always a special experience
[07:28:43] <jrajav> Cherish this moment
[07:29:01] <NoiseEee> serdem: welcome to the world of async programming
[07:29:22] <serdem> NoiseEee, well thanks.
[07:29:24] <jrajav> I would still need a crystal ball to actually help you, unless you paste an example demonstrating your problem
[07:30:41] <endberg> bye
[07:31:05] <serdem> so help please.
[07:31:30] <pachet> serdem: use callbacks prolly?
[07:32:21] <raj> can someone help me with autocomplete? http://jsfiddle.net/dr8dr/
[07:32:31] <serdem> <pachet> how am i supposed to do that? woudl you explain on the code ?
[07:32:35] <raj> it should console.log the whole selected item, not the value the user input
[07:33:29] <pachet> serdem: i'll explain all over the code, if you link it
[07:34:01] <serdem> pachet, ohh sorry :))  http://jsfiddle.net/Zwd67/
[07:34:38] <pachet> what is tsort
[07:35:19] <serdem> pachet, http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/ it sorts elements
[07:36:20] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I'm looking to select a table but it doesn't have an ID or Class
[07:37:06] <ashgotti> any ideas?
[07:38:05] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Does it have a unique parent?
[07:38:12] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/dr8dr/1/
[07:38:20] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Is it the only table on the page?
[07:38:23] <ashgotti> BillCriswell> Unfortunately no to both
[07:38:24] <BillCriswell> Lots of ifs.
[07:38:37] <BillCriswell> Is the index of it consistent?
[07:39:09] <BillCriswell> Like.. if it's always the 3rd table on the page you could do $('table').eq(2)
[07:39:20] <BillCriswell> or $('table:eq(2)')
[07:40:05] <pachet> serdem: i'm too lazy to determine whether these are asynchronous operations that tsort is doing behind the scenes
[07:40:08] <pachet> i'm guessing not
[07:40:15] <raj> shoky, I can't pass any arguments to the function
[07:40:15] <ashgotti> http://www.rgpackman.com/ I'd like the bottom right table
[07:40:25] <pachet> in which case i'm not sure what the issue is
[07:41:00] <shoky> raj: ...
[07:41:00] <ashgotti> It'll always be in the same spot but it has no ID
[07:41:35] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: $('span:content(Premium GIC Rates)').closest('table') might do the trick.
[07:41:39] <serdem> pachet, it is small file http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/src/jquery.tinysort.min.js if you check it..
[07:41:53] <ashgotti> awesome I'll give it a try!
[07:42:31] <serdem> <pachet>i i don't knwo too. i think as you say it is async problem.
[07:42:54] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Sorry, span:contains
[07:42:58] <shoky> raj:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/dr8dr/2/   :P
[07:43:10] <BillCriswell> not span:content
[07:43:30] <shoky> raj:  lemme guess, new rule ?
[07:43:44] <ashgotti> This is my first experience with jquery, do you have another min to help me display it?
[07:43:55] <ashgotti> I'm using wordpress and would like to make that table a widget
[07:44:52] <raj> lovely shoky thank you!
[07:44:58] <shoky> seriously?
[07:45:07] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: O
[07:45:22] <shoky> raj: why can't you pass any arguments to it?
[07:45:25] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: I'm not super familiar with wordpress... your best bet is to ask in wordpress I'd imagine.
[07:45:55] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: thanks. I'm trying to look up some tutorials on how to simply display content now that I can select it
[07:48:12] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: Do you know how I'd implement the selector with something like this: http://frinity.blogspot.ca/2008/06/load-remote-content-into-div-element.html
[07:48:22] <ashgotti> Since it's not a div but a specific table
[07:50:22] <Dirkos> Anyone who could help me get a good plugin to copy data from my client to the users clipboard?
[07:50:51] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: You could load to a table but it would have to be the right kind of HTML. $('span:contains(Premium GIC Rates)').closest('table').load('/path/to/data');
[07:52:33] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: Can I not just take the table and throw it as is in a div? Or do I have to map it to an exact replica table?
[07:53:05] <raj> shoky, cuz it's an independent function that takes arguments unrelated to this dinky little input field
[07:53:15] <raj> but I want that function to run when this field is updated
[07:53:31] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Not sure I'm following.. you could do like $('span:contains(Premium GIC Rates)').closest('table').replaceWith('div').load('/foo')
[07:54:27] <shoky> raj: sounds like a job for some refactoring or someshit ;p
[07:54:36] <ashgotti> Sorry, let me start from the beginning. My client would like the content of that table on their website. I tried first with an iframe but got nowhere. I looked into jquery and it can pull data from an external website. What I'm trying to do now is select that table and put it in a widget on my client's site.
[07:55:16] <Dirkos> Anyone who could help me get a good plugin to copy data from my client to the users clipboard?
[07:58:12] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: The only way I could see you getting the HTML from an external site is with a local php script and file_get_contents().
[07:58:39] <NoiseEee> ashgotti: so you mean, steal someone elses content and throw it in yoursite
[07:58:41] <carpii_> dirkos, not sure but i think it requires flash.  I use ZeroClipboard - https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard
[07:59:01] <shoky> they all require flash
[07:59:06] <shoky> if they work
[07:59:13] <carpii_> right, i thought as much. wasnt sure if HTML5 added anything since
[07:59:16] <Dirkos> yeah not really usable but thnx :)
[07:59:26] <Dirkos> i will just use a window.open for it
[07:59:27] <ashgotti> NoiseEee> Not exactly. Our client is a financial advisor who sells this company's GICs. They would like to tell their clients the GIC rates as the external site is their supplier
[07:59:38] <carpii_> its transparent btw, you dont see a flash applet or anything :)
[07:59:40] <carpii_> but ok
[07:59:56] <NoiseEee> ashgotti: if the external site wants their data to be easily available to others, they'll provide an API
[08:00:04] <NoiseEee> ashgotti: or they'll assist you in some way
[08:00:13] <NoiseEee> ashgotti: otherwise, no not possible at all with javascript.
[08:00:26] <NoiseEee> s/javascript/just javascript
[08:00:27] <ashgotti> NoiseEee> We contacted them, unfortunately they weren't very helpful as they had no idea
[08:00:55] <ashgotti> They update their own site manually daily
[08:01:05] <ashgotti> I'm trying to figure out a way so that our client doesn't have to do that
[08:01:30] <ashgotti> This plugin looks like it can do it, I just have to figure out the selector: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-web-scrapper/other_notes/
[08:01:57] <carpii_> ash, why does this have to be done client side? just write a php script on your server or something
[08:02:48] <ashgotti> carpii_: I'm new to scriping/JS so I don't know all the options. Like I said, I started with what I knew, which was an iFrame but it was difficult showing a specific portion of a page. Then I looked into JQuery which I'm trying now
[08:03:11] <carpii_> i think youre going to struggle, if they dont provide an API
[08:03:17] <carpii_> to do it clientside anyway
[08:03:24] <carpii_> serverside is pretty easy im sure
[08:03:39] <ashgotti> I figure there must be a way to scrape content from their site
[08:03:45] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Look into file_get_contents().
[08:03:55] <mo_roodi> .whoami
[08:04:05] <ashgotti> BilLCriswell: thanks, I'll look into that if this doesn't pan out - http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-web-scrapper/faq/
[08:04:06] <NoiseEee> ashgotti: its not going to be possible with javascript alone.
[08:06:28] <ashgotti> I have it working with that plugin
[08:06:47] <ashgotti> http://baird.grassrootonline.com/?page_id=129 You can see the business hours div I pulled at the bottom
[08:07:02] <_pash> hello, is there something wrong with this function? but the data doesnt get passed on click... without the .click it works
[08:07:04] <_pash> http://paste.pound-python.org/show/30788/
[08:07:23] <ashgotti> Unfortunately, selecting a table without an id or class is not as straight forward. I'm trying BillCriswell's suggestion but it's not working
[08:09:13] <NoiseEee> ashgotti: $('table') = a jquery collection of tables in your document
[08:09:15] <shoky> _pash: looks fine
[08:09:36] <_pash> shoky: if it is run without the .click() it works.. but not with it
[08:09:40] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: http://pastie.org/pastes/6342250/text?key=s7p9pnjkpsobw68f2y1mea is a quick dirty way.
[08:09:41] <shoky> .demo @ pash
[08:09:41] <b-ot> pash: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:09:44] <ashgotti> BillCriswell suggested $('span:contains(Premium GIC Rates)').closest('table')
[08:10:05] <ashgotti> This is the site http://www.rgpackman.com/
[08:10:31] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: amazing, thanks. I'll give this plugin a few more tries and then try your solution
[08:11:05] <ashgotti> the plugin is working, just selecting the table using their markup is confusing me. <?php echo wpws_get_content($url, $selector, $xpath, $wpwsopt)?> - example: <?php echo wpws_get_content('http://google.com','title','','user_agent=Bot+at+mysite.com&on_error=error_show&')?>
[08:11:41] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: The :contains selector is jquery only I believe.
[08:11:53] <BillCriswell> Could you ask them to just ad id="rates" to the table or something?
[08:12:15] <ashgotti> haha, they didn't want to make modifications incase it broke their site. They did not want to play ball at all
[08:12:24] <BillCriswell> Sucks.
[08:12:49] <ashgotti> This small table is taking up a whole day, the rest of the site is easy breezy
[08:13:03] <ashgotti> The plugin's docs has info on selectors, would the second one work? http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-web-scrapper/other_notes/
[08:13:33] <ashgotti> I just have to figure out the table #
[08:16:35] <shoky> ashgotti: when you inspect an element in devtools you can right click it and "Copy XPath". you can probably use that xpath with those plugins
[08:16:59] <BillCriswell> Damn, shoky with the protip.
[08:17:12] <ashgotti> You guys are great
[08:17:16] <ashgotti> I think I got it using the table #
[08:17:56] <BillCriswell> /html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[1]/td/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/table[3]/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody/tr/td/table MMMM xpath.
[08:18:06] <shoky> ;D
[08:18:35] <ashgotti> There it is! http://baird.grassrootonline.com/?page_id=129
[08:19:00] <radiantstatic> Any ideas on where to even remotely start on an image gallery/viewer similar to this - http://www.vitosalvatore.com/#works (click a square).
[08:19:09] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Only thing that sucks is you're at the mercy of their markup.
[08:19:23] <BillCriswell> So just be careful should they add something to the sidebar or whatever.
[08:19:36] <ashgotti> From the looks of it and speaking to them, they rarely update or change their site
[08:19:44] <ashgotti> wouldn't even let me add an id
[08:19:59] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: I hope so, for sanity's sake!
[08:20:06] <ashgotti> haha no sanity when it comes to this stuff
[08:20:10] <ashgotti> Thanks again for all the help
[08:25:50] <desy> problem with jquery 1.8.3 and wsgiserver/0.1 python /2.7.3, post or get request response is allways empty, no exception with live headers or firebug
[08:29:57] <sunbeam> whats the best way to not display the input type="submit" value?
[08:30:46] <discorpia> sunbeam: how do you mean?
[08:34:09] <sunbeam> to hide it
[08:34:10] <sunbeam> the text
[08:35:07] <discorpia> sunbeam: why not set it to empty? or where do you want to hide it?
[08:36:51] <sunbeam> its generated by wordpress i cannot set value=""
[08:37:59] <shoky> css?
[08:38:20] <carpii_> sunbeam youre not making much sense
[08:38:50] <sunbeam> text-indent: -9999 doesn't work in IE7
[08:38:55] <shoky> always looking for the best ways to do weird shit
[08:39:41] <shoky> display:none works in IE7
[08:39:50] <shoky> learning wordpress works in IE7
[08:39:56] <sunbeam> then I am hiding the whole submit button
[08:40:02] <shoky> right
[08:40:07] <sunbeam> that's not what I want
[08:40:48] <shoky> .val('') will empty it at runtime
[08:41:26] <sunbeam> ahh ok
[08:41:33] <sunbeam> but is there no way to do this with CSS
[08:41:37] <sunbeam> and have it working in IE7 ?
[08:41:45] <shoky> :\
[08:41:58] <tw2113> people still care about IE7?
[08:43:22] <desy> :/quit
[08:45:29] <tw2113> see what caring about IE7 does? it makes people quit
[08:50:57] <carpii_> rightly so
[08:54:56] <sunbeam> why not care about IE7 ?
[08:54:59] <sunbeam> just wondering
[08:55:11] <snover> because it’s awful and almost nobody uses it
[08:55:47] <tw2113> it's ready to go the way of the dinosaur
[08:55:55] <tw2113> IE8 is bad enough technically
[08:56:04] <tw2113> IE6 became a running punchline
[08:56:14] <tw2113> and i've heard that more people are on mobile than IE6-7 combined
[08:57:26] <tw2113> plus the sooner we stop catering to legacy, the sooner i hope people upgrade for the better experience
[08:57:30] <carpii_> thers just no reason for anyone to be using IE7 anymore
[08:57:33] <tw2113> if not, then i'm fine with losing fringe viewers
[08:57:40] <carpii_> you could argue IE8 still needs to be supported because of WIndows XP
[08:58:14] <NoiseEee> its true, the userbase of ie7 is super small
[08:58:15] <tw2113> yeah, and MS forced everyone to at least IE8 there
[08:58:24] <FernandoBasso> I have a window.location.reload() that is not working. What is wrong here: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/4504209
[08:58:46] <carpii_> i dont think anything above IE8 is available for XP
[08:58:54] <tw2113> just non IE browsers
[08:59:13] <carpii_> ahh, lovely non-IE browsers :)
[09:00:05] <tw2113> <selfrighteous> if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem!</selfrighteous>
[09:10:36] <raj> if I do a $.post with `'data':{'test':['abc','xyz'],'test2':'thing'}`, `data` looks just like it was sent. But if I do $.get, I get 'test[]' and 'test2[]' serverside
[09:13:49] <raj> actually no, $.post does that too
[09:13:52] <raj> i have no idea why
[09:13:59] <raj> sometimes, I can do an ajax request with this issue
[09:20:53] <didiergm> hi guys; probably dead simple but I am drawing a blank. I have a page with a list (ul li a /li li a /li /ul) of users, each user has an id; I need to load a page with a form on clicking the anchor link, but how do I pass the id along with the url ?
[09:21:22] <carpii_> which element stores the ID you want to pass?
[09:21:43] <didiergm> you're too quick :) the id is stored on a data- attribute
[09:21:59] <didiergm> of the anchor tag
[09:22:39] <carpii_> $("ul li a")click(function() { alert($(this).data("userid"); });
[09:22:50] <carpii_> ).click
[09:23:17] <didiergm> and I would just do a loadPage with the relevant url ?
[09:23:50] <carpii_> yeah
[09:23:51] <didiergm> and the id appended to the url after a ?
[09:23:57] <didiergm> kk thanks
[09:24:06] <carpii_> well not appended as such
[09:24:18] <carpii_> better to use .load(url, data
[09:24:36] <shoky> raj: if you dont set a contentType and just post an object, jquery will post it as a query string
[09:24:47] <didiergm> thanks carpii_, I'll try that
[09:25:13] <raj> shoky, why isn't it able to guess?
[09:25:43] <raj> oh, I'm thinking dataType
[09:26:01] <shoky> it is guessing
[09:26:08] <raj> what should contentType be?
[09:26:13] <shoky> it's guessing you want a normal query string ;p
[09:26:19] <raj> I guess
[09:26:34] <shoky> well, contentType doesn't really matter, if you just send JSON
[09:26:41] <shoky> a JSON string, that is
[09:26:49] <tlkr> Does anyone else ever have an issue where script just doesn't work properly when developing on Firefox until the cache is cleared?
[09:27:22] <shoky> raj: you can also send a JSON string inside the query string. e.g.  data: { myObj: JSON.stringify(someObject) }
[09:27:55] <carpii_> tlkr ive known problem with scripts dealing with cached images
[09:28:00] <carpii_> but not cached scripts themselves
[09:28:10] <raj> shoky, but why can't I just send an object directly?
[09:28:29] <shoky> raj: the internet doesn't know what an object is
[09:28:41] <shoky> you send a stream of data
[09:28:51] <shoky> its either gonna be a query string
[09:28:56] <shoky> or a JSON string
[09:29:04] <shoky> or a query string with JSON embedded inside
[09:29:21] <raj> what's the diff btwn json string and query string?
[09:29:32] <raj> oh, = and stuff
[09:29:34] <shoky> raj:  that's what JSON is for, sending objects from one place to another
[09:29:34] <raj> right
[09:30:22] <tlkr> carpii_, I had the same issue today, except it just fixed itself after going back / forward on the browser tab.
[09:31:07] <shoky> raj: so u good?
[09:32:33] <walidvb> hi all, i once read about a guy who was creating a plugin that would load sharing buttons only once clicked on it, to prevent data mining unless "requested". anyone remembers that? i think the guy posted his github
[09:48:49] <FernandoBasso> How could I turn a number like 411014 to 4.110,14 ?
[09:49:40] <StephenS> You want do that with jquery
[09:49:40] <bil`> If have a click handler bound to a DOM element and the element is destroyed, what happens to the handler?
[09:49:46] <StephenS> wont*
[09:49:55] <StephenS> bil`gone too
[09:49:55] <FernandoBasso> StephenS: Pure javascript?
[09:50:13] <bil`> is that a function of jquery or native js
[09:50:14] <StephenS> Yes
[09:50:20] <StephenS> for FernandoBasso
[09:50:28] <bil`> removing the hanlder that is
[09:50:28] <StephenS> bijquery
[09:52:12] <walidvb> you guys are all making a lot of sense
[09:52:24] <walidvb> :)
[09:52:36] <walidvb> *sorry none of my business*
[09:53:52] <NoiseEee> bil`: jquery does it. if you set the handler via jquery, and remove the element via jquery, it will be taken care of.  in natural JS, you need to remove the event first
[09:54:21] <bil`> cool thanks
[09:56:50] <shoky> hmm
[09:57:27] <shoky> so how come http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VwpPS/3/  sends a GET?  adding a slash to the end of the url fixes it ;S
[09:57:48] <shoky> oh
[09:57:51] <shoky> nevermind :\
[10:01:15] <sha1sum> Hey guys. How can I intentionally trigger a toggle event? I've been trying "trigger" but that's not working, and I also tried "trigger()" (no arguments) and that's not working either.
[10:01:28] <sha1sum> I mean "toggle()" no arguments
[10:01:56] <sha1sum> nevermind.
[10:02:07] <sha1sum> Just found the answer. That always happens. I search, can't find anything, ask, then I find it.
[10:20:33] <mikedoty> I have a table with 100 tr rows.  Every 10th row is a "repeat header" that shows the original headers.  I want to do $(table).find("tr:even").addClass("zebra") to stripe it, except I want to "reset" the even/odd count at the start of each "section," where a section is the group of rows between each header row
[10:20:44] <mikedoty> They're all tr though, so I'm not sure if there is an easy way to do this?
[10:21:29] <djQuery> mikedoty, why not use a fixed header and scrol the tbody?
[10:23:27] <mikedoty> I could give tha ta try djQuery, but not sure that would go over with the boss
[10:23:42] <djQuery> mikedoty, there are tons of examples on it
[10:25:27] <djQuery> mikedoty, put up a demo, I got the code in my head but to long to type here
[10:25:59] <djQuery> mikedoty, for the way that you are doing it now
[10:26:20] <djQuery> `demo
[10:26:22] <b-ot> djQuery: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:29:36] <jeredepp> anybody familiar with the youtube jsapi here?
[10:32:06] <jeredepp> or does anybody know how i add a parameter to a callback like document.addCustomListener('listener','functionname') i need the id of element which called this listener
[10:35:03] <mikedoty> djQuery: This is what I think will work, sorry I wasn't explaining it very well http://jsfiddle.net/Uhk5n/
[10:35:18] <NoiseEee> document.addCustomListener('listener',function() { functionName('param'); }); @ jeredepp
[10:37:47] <djQuery> mikedoty, looks good to me
[10:38:04] <djQuery> mikedoty, had forgotten nextuntil
[10:38:05] <mikedoty> thanks
[10:38:13] <mikedoty> Yeah I hadn't used it before but it seems ok
[10:40:08] <goddard> can some one help?  This doesn't work in IE http://jsfiddle.net/925h2/
[10:41:36] <tw2113> just another in a long list *runs*
[10:42:22] <carpii_> saying it 'doesnt work' doesnt tell us anything
[10:42:37] <goddard> carpii_: did you look at the fiddle?
[10:42:45] <carpii_> yes
[10:42:48] <jeredepp> NoiseEee: i don't get it, this paste works and i get a playerID http://pastebin.com/U3SJBGr9 how would i have to it add the playerId to the callback
[10:42:56] <goddard> carpii_: ok then it doesn't work in ie
[10:43:02] <goddard> carpii_: no errors nothing
[10:43:03] <carpii_> ok then good luck fixing it
[10:43:16] <goddard> carpii_: i cant give you information i dont have bud
[10:44:13] <NoiseEee> jeredepp: as i explained... handler.addEventListener("onStateChange", function() { onPlayerStateChange('someState'); });
[10:44:46] <goddard> carpii_: my function works great when the element is in the page
[10:44:54] <goddard> carpii_: just not when it is inserted with JS
[10:45:06] <goddard> carpii_: even if it is inserted before the function declaration
[10:45:08] <jeredepp> NoiseEee: no i don't get why the parameter newState just magically appears but when i try to call it as function it doesn't even enter the function
[10:46:22] <carpii_> but which aspect of your function is not working? the blur handler? the submit? adding to the dom?
[10:46:35] <NoiseEee> jeredepp: sorry i don't follo
[10:46:37] <NoiseEee> w
[10:46:53] <goddard> carpii_: none of it is working on the inserted input fields
[10:47:16] <jacta> Does anyone know an alternative to Orbit slider that can do thumbnails from the images too
[10:48:00] <jeredepp> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/2cU25G4T
[10:48:07] <jacta> something like this: http://tinyurl.com/bfw8wbe - but this fails in ie8 and down
[10:48:12] <goddard> carpii_: it works on the fields in the page though http://jsfiddle.net/925h2/1/
[10:48:46] <TheSisb> Does anyone know why the results are as they are in this perf? http://jsperf.com/execute-plugin-on-non-existant-element/6
[10:48:46] <jeredepp> NoiseEee: forgot a semicolon in the bin, but same result
[10:49:06] <carpii_> goddard, log to conole to make sure IE is receiving the events
[10:49:27] <carpii_> and try using the "input[type=text] selector instead of :text
[10:49:42] <carpii_> :text is slower and kinda emulated by jQuery rather than native DOM
[10:49:50] <NoiseEee> jeredepp: maybe its expecting the event. why are you passing playerID anyways
[10:50:24] <NoiseEee> jeredepp: function(ev) { onPlayerStateChange(ev) }    again not really sure what you're after
[10:51:07] <jeredepp> NoiseEee: trying to make a webapp in which you can add x videos and control it with a midiboard
[10:52:14] <radiantstatic_> Any ideas on where to even remotely start on an image gallery/viewer similar to this - http://www.vitosalvatore.com/#works (click a square)?
[10:52:49] <goddard> carpii_: I tried what you said and it gives no difference...
[10:53:17] <carpii_> and the console.log ? IE is getting the events ?
[10:53:43] <radiantstatic_> Any ideas?
[10:54:35] <BoF> help me plz
[10:55:36] <BoF> alguien de habla hispana por acá?
[10:56:00] <goddard> carpii_: it appears the events are never triggered
[10:57:29] <goddard> carpii_: actually using input[type=text] messes up the input fields that aren't loaded via javascript
[10:57:53] <carpii_> youd need to use event delegation to handle the dynamically cerated ones
[10:58:28] <carpii_> $("body").on("focus", "input[type=text", function() {
[10:59:02] <carpii_> but in theory yours should work because the elements have been added by the time the events are bound
[10:59:11] <carpii_> so i just dont know. single step through it in IE debugger
[10:59:26] <carpii_> and check active is what you think it is, because maybe its null or something
[10:59:54] <goddard> carpii_: so this? http://lab.distilldesign.com/event-delegation/
[11:00:17] <carpii_> same idea, but thats out of date
[11:00:46] <carpii_> use http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:05:00] <gandolf> can someone reccomend a slider plugin that would allow me to do something like this http://i.imgur.com/4sMSvH2.png
[11:05:13] <gandolf> each model is a seperate slide and you can go from side to side
[11:05:41] <carpii_> seems like itd be a fairly easy thig to write gandalf
[11:05:44] <carpii_> why a plugin?
[11:06:53] <gandolf> It seems like it would be easier to use a jquery plugin
[11:07:37] <TheSisb> .on() is the greatest thing in JS since Arrays
[11:07:56] <goddard> Ω
[11:08:17] <eph3meral> how does jquery know to interpret this ajax response as javascript and run it?
[11:09:20] <eph3meral> like, the backend server renders and returns just plain old javascript
[11:09:29] <eph3meral> I've stepped through the process in the chrome debugger
[11:09:47] <eph3meral> is this a default thing in jquery? and specifically which part of the manual (or ajax page in the manual) has more about this and how it works?
[11:09:54] <carpii_> check the content-type on the http response
[11:10:15] <carpii_> and you can also tell $.ajax the data-type to expect
[11:11:12] <eph3meral> ok so Content-Type is application/javascript, so that means rails knows to deliver that content type for some reason but I don't know how… hmm
[11:11:29] <eph3meral> oh wait, nevermind, I'm an idiot and I totally get it now :)
[11:11:33] <eph3meral> carpii_: thanks XD
[11:11:38] <carpii_> its probably your httpd server rather than rails
[11:11:51] <carpii_> np
[11:12:41] <goddard> damn i wish there was an easier way to do this
[11:15:05] <NoWired> fucking raphael.js..... :S
[11:15:47] <spiffie> quick question: docs say XHR success method is depreated. this only applies to the .success of the jqXHR object, not the success option passsed as init, yes?
[11:18:15] <djQuery> is there a way to bind to a particular page loading in jqm
[11:18:35] <NoiseEee> spiffie: "the success option passsed as init" ?
[11:19:22] <spiffie> NoiseEee: sorry, as an option in ajax settings
[11:21:07] <NoiseEee> spiffie: code sample?  it sounds like you are indeed attaching the 'success' function on the xhr object, you want to use .done
[11:23:31] <spiffie> NoiseEee: I mean as a setting parameter, like: $.ajax({type: "post", success: function() { ... }});
[11:24:04] <BoF> i need to send a result of sql sentence to jquery file, plz i need help ->>http://imageshack.us/f/443/capturadepantalla201302zp.png/

[11:26:34] <spiffie> NoiseEee: okay, thanks. I just wasn't sure since the bloc for success in settings doesn't mention one way or the other on docs: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:26:48] <NoiseEee> spiffie: right, i think the docs need updating there.

[11:30:16] <goddard> anyone got an idea on how to get this working
[11:31:55] <NoiseEee> goddard: whats it supposed to be doing?
[11:35:25] <goddard> NoiseEee: if you have IE you can test it the best there since placeholder doesn't work, but if you don't in Safari for me it displays the text darker then normal
[11:35:30] <jacta> Anyone into carouFredSel
[11:35:36] <goddard> NoiseEee: it is just a placeholder replacement for IE
[11:36:05] <goddard> NoiseEee: i have elements inserted via jquery and its those elements that it doesn't work
[11:36:56] <BoF> i need to send a result of sql sentence to jquery file, plz i need help ->>http://imageshack.us/f/443/capturadepantalla201302zp.png/
[11:37:08] <NoiseEee> well i don't have IE goddard sorry
[11:39:29] <goddard> NoiseEee: you can test it with Safari as well
[11:39:36] <goddard> NoiseEee: the text appears darker
[11:39:48] <BoF> i need to send a result of sql sentence to jquery file, plz i need help ->>http://imageshack.us/f/443/capturadepantalla201302zp.png/
[11:48:47] <sunbeam> I'm creating a responsive version of a site, i have a link, click here to see us on google maps, is it wise to let this open the google maps in a new window?
[11:52:11] <goddard> is there any way to change type in ie?
[11:52:16] <goddard> ie 8 in particular
[11:53:11] <snover> i assume you mean on an input element; no
[11:54:27] <goddard> so how can you simulate a placeholder in IE on a password field?
[11:55:13] <snover> there are so many options.
[11:55:28] <goddard> please enlighten me
[11:57:21] <NoiseEee> var placeholder = 'some text string';   el.on('change', function(ev) { checkForPlaceholder(ev); );  fn checkForPlaceholder(ev) { //discover element by querying ev;  if(element.val()==='') { element.val(placeholder); }    kind of thing
[12:10:18] <xmaddness> How do you deal with a radio button and making it checked? It seems my code is causing both to have the checked="checked" attribute set
[12:10:29] <xmaddness> =\
[12:10:47] <xmaddness> Do I have to spin through the others and remove that attribute manually?
[12:12:10] <NoiseEee> xmaddness: the others should uncheck automatically provided they all share the same name attribute
[12:12:21] <someish> I'm iterating through a set of matched elements with each and I'm trying to create a hash based on some attribute values. The object properties are getting overwritten. How can I avoid that?
[12:12:23] <xmaddness> They do have the same name
[12:12:38] <xmaddness> which is why this is so weird
[12:12:55] <NoiseEee> well you know the next step is asking you to reproduce on jsfiddle or jsbin
[12:12:58] <NoiseEee> ;)
[12:13:02] <xmaddness> yeah I know this
[12:13:03] <xmaddness> :(
[12:16:25] <xmaddness> eh, this is going to be hell to recreate
[12:16:26] <xmaddness> lol
[12:16:27] <sunbeam> I'm creating a responsive version of a site, i have a link, click here to see us on google maps, is it wise to let this open the google maps in a new window?
[12:18:17] <shoky> if that's what you want to happen, it sounds very wise
[12:22:35] <jasper^off> hej guys, I have a question about slideDown with hide
[12:22:36] <jasper^off>  $('#chat_window').hide("slide", { direction: "down" }, 1000);
[12:22:40] <jasper^off> for some reason that line doesn't work for me
[12:22:45] <jasper^off> while only .hide() does...
[12:23:03] <jasper^off> what could be the reason for this?
[12:24:17] <sunbeam> shoky: i don't know where else to display it
[12:24:23] <BoF> i need to send a result of sql sentence to jquery file, plz i need help ->>http://imageshack.us/f/443/capturadepantalla201302zp.png/
[12:25:33] <shoky> sunbeam: wherever you want it displayed?
[12:29:51] <burg> hello. if i load a form with ajax in a modal window, how can i bind submit event to that form?
[12:30:26] <goddard> $('submit').bind
[12:35:20] <goddard> only way to simulate changing type is to clone the object and change its type before inserting it into the DOM
[12:35:22] <burg> goddard, the form must already exist to call bind on it. but the form will be loaded with ajax
[12:35:47] <goddard> that always works for me
[12:36:30] <burg> goddard, i should use something similar to live, but live is now deprecated. the only workaround i found is to also load the js via ajax when i load the form
[12:37:39] <jasper^off> hej guys, I have a question about slideDown with hide.  for some reason this line doesn't work for me
[12:37:43] <jasper^off> $('#chat_window').hide("slide", { direction: "down" }, 1000);
[12:37:48] <jasper^off> while only .hide() does...
[12:37:52] <jasper^off> anyone?
[12:37:57] <goddard> burg: some one just told me about delegate
[12:38:04] <goddard> that will probably work
[12:38:15] <goddard> since it works with newly elements loaded in the DOM
[12:38:50] <goddard> you can do delegate('element', 'click', function()
[12:40:02] <NoiseEee> burg: $(someElementThatIsParentToAllNewThingsYouCareAbout).on('submit','form',function() { alert('wow, a form wants to be submitted!')})
[12:40:13] <goddard> .on and .delegate on the same
[12:41:52] <burg> NoiseEee, that would work. the only problem is that i use some modal to load the form (included in the framework i work with) and the modal content is appended to 'body'. so i should do $('body').on('submit', 'form', function() {})
[12:42:23] <carpii_> i think delegate is likely to be deprecated, but its param order differs from .on too
[12:47:44] <loincloth> hallo
[12:48:30] <Nero_pr> i need to do a image gallery reading the images from a database  any help?
[12:48:34] <loincloth> i am having trouble using jquery.ui.tooltip to trigger open/close behaviors when i want
[12:49:07] <loincloth> i setup the tooltip disabled then later try tooltip('open') and tooltip('close').. it works except that once 'close' is called subsequent 'open' calls do nothing
[12:49:18] <loincloth> i've searched and read docs.. not sure what i'm missing at this point
[12:50:02] <loincloth> any ideas as to my tooltip problem? are there must-see references and examples beyond the docs and surface level google searches?
[12:52:37] <Nero_pr> i need to do a image gallery reading the images from a database  any help?
[12:53:57] <kripster> Could someone tell me why my styling is not being applied for this simple text box? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/73/ thanks
[12:54:03] <loincloth> jquery.ui.tooltip code is pretty small.. so i can see that it seems the close method removes the tooltip instead of just hiding it
[12:54:25] <loincloth> this confuses me.. am i expected to re-setup every time? the names of methods and documentation suggest there is a separate method for this kind of destructive removal
[12:59:13] <kripster> if i select #vdet thats fine but i want to apply this to many textfields so I want to use the class name which from what i understand it is .mandatory, any ideas?? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/73/
[12:59:21] <djQuery>  using jquery mobile I have a <input type="text" css="disply: none"> yet it shows when the page loads
[12:59:38] <say2joe1> kripster: are you aware that extra classes are overriding values on the input? look at the rendered source.
[13:00:30] <say2joe1> kripster: specifically, jquery mobile is overriding the values you set in .mandatory.
[13:01:47] <kripster> say2joe1: ok so what should i do, how do i disable what jquery is overriding?
[13:02:08] <jeffreylevesque> is there a way to remove 'fadeout()' from an element?
[13:02:44] <djQuery> why does this input show up http://jsbin.com/iqunuj/1/edit  it should be hidden
[13:03:19] <jasper^off> hej guys
[13:03:27] <amh345> afternoon all.   how do i get the full path up to filename from an image src?  i figured out how to get the filename, but not the other way around :)
[13:03:30] <jasper^off> is there any way to let elements around a sliding element keep track of it?
[13:04:23] <say2joe1> kripster: you can just add !important to your css… that "should" do the trick.
[13:05:48] <amh345> ah. got it.
[13:06:30] <kripster> say2joe1: like this http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/84/ ???
[13:07:25] <kripster> say2jo1: got it, thanks man
[13:07:46] <xmaddness> I come baring jsfiddles
[13:08:17] <xmaddness> So here is my issue, clicking this click handler works only for the first 2 clicks, then stops afterwards http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/
[13:08:33] <xmaddness> click each link to switch the selected input
[13:08:48] <xmaddness> any help is greatly approcoated, as I am starting to seriously feel nubish
[13:09:33] <xmaddness> (and yes I know delegate is dep'ed, I'm stuck with 1.3.x on this project =\  )
[13:13:07] <suppp> anybody here uses jquery ui ? I have a question. when using the spinner widget, this makes my input boxes have rounded corners. but my normal input boxes that are not spinners don't have rounded corners. this makes the form look weird. i cannot find a "text input widget" that would make my regular text inputs look the same as the spinners. how could i make my normal text inputs look like the spinners ( with rounded corners ) ?
[13:13:21] <djQuery> xmaddness, hmm gave it a shot http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/1/
[13:13:46] <djQuery> xmaddness, http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/2/
[13:14:08] <xmaddness> djQuery: thanks, but it still fails if you keep clicking back and forth between the links
[13:14:16] <Woet> xmaddness: if I get a jQuery version closer to 1.3.x (such as 1.6.4) on jsfiddle, it works.
[13:14:27] <xmaddness> hrmm
[13:14:34] <Woet> xmaddness: http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/3/
[13:14:36] <xmaddness> I am deving with 1.9 in my test harness
[13:14:43] <xmaddness> and I believe the same happens with on
[13:14:56] <Woet> well you mention you're stuck on 1.3.x
[13:15:00] <Woet> so use that in your dev env too
[13:15:01] <djQuery> xmaddness, yeah it works with 1.6.4 http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/4/
[13:15:27] <xmaddness> so it this an issue with 1.9?
[13:15:38] <xmaddness> or am i just failing hard?
[13:15:47] <djQuery> xmaddness, seems it seems like 1.9 delegate is working like .once
[13:15:56] <xmaddness> okay one sec
[13:16:00] <xmaddness> let me try with on
[13:16:39] <xmaddness> http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/6/
[13:16:41] <xmaddness> same with on
[13:17:11] <xmaddness> and 1.9.1
[13:17:56] <xmaddness> the weird part is that the checked does move between the elems
[13:18:00] <plipp> I practicing a bit with genshi and jQuery and I have a question..  What is the/a proper way of getting an updated list (python) and showing it as such (ul, table..)?
[13:18:00] <plipp> I made a simple template with <table id="users"> <tr py:"for user in users"...>, but I don't know how to get that section updated? jQuery(<id>).html/attrs..?
[13:19:07] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/eB59P/7/ @ xmaddness (use prop)
[13:19:57] <xmaddness> okay I thought about that, but was hesitant due to me having to use 1.3.2
[13:20:13] <xmaddness> but I'm glad to see something working, thanks
[13:20:41] <andress_> hello.. can anybody tell me why in the last tab im seeing the map up to half only http://jsfiddle.net/DHZNv/399/
[13:22:39] <loincloth> for anybody who saw my tooltip ramblings.. the issue was that the 'close' method removes the 'title' attribute which prevents the tooltip from working after that.. which is counterintuitive buggy behavior since the API makes no clear requirement to use the title attribute..
[13:22:54] <andress_> for some reason when i select inspect element in firebug it loads completely
[13:22:57] <loincloth> THE MORE YOU KNOW.. AFTER WASTING SEVERAL HOURS ON FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS.. -sparkle and fade-
[13:23:04] <xmaddness> hrmm, seems 1.3.2 doesn't have delegate either, live it is
[13:23:36] <xmaddness> annnnnd it's working now
[13:23:38] <xmaddness> thanks all
[13:24:15] <xmaddness> lesson here, if you are coding a test harness for production code, write against the same version of jQuery as in production
[13:24:21] <xmaddness> =\
[13:25:17] <[E]sc> I'm trying to remove static and dynamically added content, however, my script will only remove static content but not dynamically added ones; can someone point me in the right direction?  i tried using on and bind. http://jsfiddle.net/MnYmb/
[13:25:22] <jeffreylevesque> is there a way to cancel an event that is currently occuring
[13:25:38] <xmaddness> e.preventDefault perhaps?
[13:27:01] <sunbeam> I'm creating a responsive version of a site, i have a link, click here to see us on google maps, is it wise to let this open the google maps in a new window?
[13:36:29] <kripster> could someone tell me how to add a class to the above dropdown so that only top one has styling applied to it? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/113/
[13:36:31] <kripster> thx
[13:39:37] <kripster> in other words say i have 20 dropdowns, instead of applying styling to each dropdown if i assign a class mandatory to 10 of them how can i apply that to only the 10? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/113/
[13:40:51] <neataroni> I am having a problem jquery mobile's inset list view- when i call .listview('refresh'), i see it adds a class to my new li's, but it doesn't add the additional data- attribs, and I also see the added class is missing some things
[13:42:35] <kripster> any ideas say2joe1?
[13:46:26] <goddard> .on doesn't work if you remove and readd an element?
[13:46:37] <goddard> with the same id name
[13:47:35] <NoiseEee> goddard: once you've removed the element, any handler goes away as well
[13:47:43] <NoiseEee> goddard: another argument for using delegation on a parent element
[13:49:04] <goddard> ok i see
[13:49:36] <kripster> say i have 10 dropdowns, i only want to apply styling to 5 of them, instead of applying to each of them how do i add a class to 5 of them , eg http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/113/ i only want styling applied to first one
[13:50:48] <chilversc> goddard: the handler is attached to the object (dom node) if you remove that node, create a new node and add that, then it's a different object
[13:56:12] <kripster> where should i apply my class? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/113/
[13:56:44] <jorn> heyho, uhm, if i use the $.ajax username and password options, does the browser by some account save that information or is it safe to assume it's only set in the http header fields?
[13:56:50] <shoky> kripster here's one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/khtvS/115/
[13:57:45] <NoiseEee> $.ajax username and password options, jorn?
[13:58:16] <jorn> my question is related to this: http://kizzx2.com/blog/index.php/2008/08/25/let-the-web-browser-remember-http-authentication-credentials-using-ajax-the-correct-way-vs-the-wrong-way/ explaining that some forms of XMLHttpRequest save the auth tokens while if it's just set as header the browser doesn't
[13:59:41] <kripster> shoky:thanks again
[13:59:47] <jorn> NoiseEee: yes, you can pass a settings object with values for those keys
[14:00:50] <NoiseEee> jorn: i think thats something you'd have to test yourself.  your reference is 5 years old... just please use SSL.
[14:01:15] <neataroni> im having trouble getting a jquery mobile listview to show backbone views right- does this have something to do with the way backbone updates each view's html? how will jquery know which views to refresh?
[14:01:30] <jorn> NoiseEee: thanks… didn't ask for ssl though, as it's not in my choice
[14:01:31] <Progster> having issues with jQuery 1.7.2 and IE9, CORS AJAX requests coming back with "access is denied." Chrome and Firefox work fine. Already enabled jQuery.support.cors = true. Google doesn't say much else. Anyone else run across this?
[14:01:41] <NoiseEee> jorn: then everyone sees the username and password across the network,
[14:02:08] <jorn> NoiseEee: so?
[14:02:30] <NoiseEee> jorn: yeah, uh security and all that jazz.
[14:02:50] <jorn> NoiseEee: well, believe it or not, there are use cases where it doesn't matter
[14:03:12] <NoiseEee> jorn: in my mind, anything transmitting a username/password over a network must use SSL
[14:03:15] <NoiseEee> otherwise lol
[14:03:22] <NoiseEee> meet you at the public wifi!
[14:09:43] <jorn> NoiseEee: freenode was a helpful network back in the days, but then a lot of people came along who lecture you about stuff assuming they know your own usecase better than you do yourself. i know you're here voluntarily, but think about how often you assume "idiot"
[14:10:23] <NoiseEee> i don't assume idiot, i don't think my tone reflected that
[14:10:36] <NoiseEee> what I *do* see is a lack of concern for security just about everywhere
[14:10:41] <jorn> maybe i read that into it then, sorry
[14:10:50] <NoiseEee> so that was my request ("please") to use SSL
[14:11:01] <NoiseEee> so it was intended as a friendly heads up
[14:11:28] <Progster> having issues with jQuery 1.7.2 and IE9, CORS AJAX requests coming back with "access is denied." Chrome and Firefox work fine. Already enabled jQuery.support.cors = true. Google doesn't say much else. Anyone else run across this?
[14:12:28] <bil`> does .val() do any kind of cross-browser normalization? It seems in most cases pointless as you can do $(selector).value instead
[14:12:32] <jorn> NoiseEee: yupp, i would use ssl if i had the option… problem is that the server side is a REST endpoint with auth, no ssl :(
[14:12:53] <jorn> (and not under my control)
[14:13:37] <NoiseEee> jorn: no worries, good luck :)
[14:14:25] <jorn> NoiseEee: thanks, sorry for my grumpyness

[14:37:35] <BostonMA1776> I have tried every suggestion on google.
[14:37:49] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, move the mouse enter and leave out of the loop
[14:38:30] <BostonMA1776> Okay I will try thank you.
[14:38:51] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, heck it can be completly outside of the dots functin and it would still work

[15:06:39] <viktorminator> hello jquery sirs. anyone can link me to solving next issue: after jQuery animation - animate() - I have style attribute which I want to clear. How can I do it?
[15:07:02] <CrazyZurfer> Hello guys, I'm trying to use autocomplete function from jquery UI, and I cannot make it work. I think it's because I don't understand the way it asks to my script for the results (I'm using JSON from external source). I've trying to get results from autocompletar.php?tipo=colegio&input={Here the input}
[15:07:16] <tw2113> sirs and madams
[15:07:24] <CrazyZurfer> and I'm using this way in Jquery to get results "autocompletar.php?tipo=colegio&input="
[15:07:43] <CrazyZurfer> $("#colegio").autocomplete({             source:"autocompletado.php?tipo=colegio",             minLength:2         });
[15:08:30] <cew821> Hi JQuery! JQUI Autocomplete question here: I have a smallish-list of product categories I would like to use as my source (less than 20 now, eventually may be as many as 200). This is a rails application. Do you think it makes sense to use a helper method to generate a local array of the items, or is it always better to use a remote and do the search server side?
[15:08:53] <viktorminator> madams hello also =)
[15:09:15] <viktorminator> didn't mean to be rude =)
[15:19:18] <ReBa_> viktorminator, http://api.jquery.com/animate/ Look at the complete function
[15:19:38] <sheilablackrose> hi guys, i have an image of a guy holding a tablet as my background. I would like to do some animation where only th eimage in the tablet changes and some text jumps into th ebackground. can someone point me in the directioni should read on.
[15:20:10] <viktorminator> thanks, ReBa_, I'm newbie =) will try to do my own
[15:20:26] <ReBa_> viktorminator, Look at the bottom, you have a nice example there
[15:20:35] <coldhead> oh god, sheilablackrose
[15:21:21] <sheilablackrose> oh no its coldhead
[15:21:29] <ReBa_> I would say flash or the html5 canvas methods sheilablackrose. You are doing something difficult, especially if you want it to be responsive
[15:22:06] <sheilablackrose> something with a jqury timer?
[15:22:15] <sheilablackrose> its like one of th eimage is a slider
[15:22:24] <sheilablackrose> so i could get it to fade in and out right
[15:22:25] <sheilablackrose> ?
[15:23:22] <ReBa_> If you can set the image container of the changing images right on the position where you want the tablet image to be placed, you could do it with like slidejs
[15:23:52] <ReBa_> There you can have slides and fades, it's a quite simple plugin
[15:24:01] <sheilablackrose> ic
[15:24:18] <sheilablackrose> sounds good
[15:24:28] <ReBa_> And it's not that much code: http://slidesjs.com/
[15:24:30] <sheilablackrose> what is that plugin call?
[15:24:36] <sheilablackrose> ok thank you
[15:24:38] <sheilablackrose> ill read on that
[15:25:02] <ReBa_> But you have to keep in mind that it will change it's place once resizing the browser
[15:26:13] <sheilablackrose> oh now that sound even more complicated
[15:26:24] <sheilablackrose> but basically i need a startihng point to research
[15:26:35] <sheilablackrose> that would be the slider plugin right
[15:26:36] <sheilablackrose> ?
[15:28:00] <ReBa_> The problem is you are doing it on a background. A background image will change in size and scale if wanted to be responsive
[15:28:33] <ReBa_> and your point will be static, unless you find a way to keep it triggered to that specific point but I guess you will have a lot of troubles then
[15:28:48] <sheilablackrose> ic
[15:29:01] <sheilablackrose> so even if i have all th eimage at the accurate size
[15:29:03] <sheilablackrose> its still will b a problem
[15:29:04] <sheilablackrose> ?
[15:29:15] <ReBa_> Yes
[15:30:50] <sheilablackrose> http://easyweddings.com.au/shop/
[15:31:15] <sheilablackrose> something like that but only part of th ebackground change
[15:31:34] <sheilablackrose> so do i still use the slider method?
[15:31:49] <sheilablackrose> since the background will b static?
[15:33:45] <ReBa_> Like the part where the woman looks up and the iPad flies away?
[15:35:10] <sheilablackrose> like on the second image there a tablet right
[15:35:16] <sheilablackrose> so basically that will b the static background
[15:35:23] <naeluh> maybe you could do that with css animations
[15:35:25] <sheilablackrose> n the ocntent of the tablet is wat changes over time
[15:36:50] <Stilo> i've a form/submit to post msgs but when I press submit nothing appear on the screen, that problem can be solved with jq?
[15:37:06] <sheilablackrose> *content
[15:37:09] <ReBa_> Looking at it, and naeluh could be right. CSS animation could fit. But to be honest, you are looking at something I think is quite complicated.
[15:37:24] <jeffreylevesque> is there a way to detect if an event is currently executing, for example if you have delay 5000, and while the delay hits the second second you want to to know if the delay() is executing?
[15:37:39] <sheilablackrose> yes i know but i doint have a choice :(
[15:37:42] <sheilablackrose> css animation
[15:37:46] <sheilablackrose> got it ill read on that
[15:37:49] <ReBa_> CSS3 animations
[15:39:39] <naeluh> yeah I remember seeing something in this http://iosscripts.com/iosslider/ if you download the main example there is a little like css anime trick i think he does to get this to work maybe you could expand on it with some of your own code?
[15:40:17] <sheilablackrose> thank so much
[15:41:12] <sheilablackrose> ill read up on css3  thanks again
[15:41:22] <sheilablackrose> at least its a starting point :)
[15:41:24] <ReBa_> Nice naeluh! :) Looks interesting to look at
[15:42:40] <naeluh> sheilablackrose ReBa_  javascript is awesome jquery is awesome
[15:42:41] <naeluh> haha
[15:43:27] <samholmes> How do I check if a keypress/up/down event is on a letter or number key?
[15:46:47] <sheilablackrose> haha
[15:50:01] <basiclaser> if i want to assign the current value of a slider to a variable, what is correct syntax?<input name="slider-12" id="slider-12" data-highlight="true" min="0" max="180" value="50" type="range">
[15:50:08] <basiclaser> <input name="slider-12" id="slider-12" data-highlight="true" min="0" max="180" value="50" type="range">
[15:50:17] <basiclaser> var time = $('input').value();

[15:51:51] <basiclaser> boytoy: have you looked at jquery ui or mobile?
[15:55:48] <capt_blackwood> when I roll my next wordpress theme. I'm using jquery ui from the website
[15:56:21] <basiclaser> :D
[15:56:45] <capt_blackwood> That and the theme's functions.php ain't gonna be as full
[15:57:01] <capt_blackwood> </rant>
[15:57:13] <capt_blackwood> <happy wordpress user>
[15:57:16] <capt_blackwood> ^^^ LOL
[15:57:45] <Zzaichik> I've been trying to use jquery.mobile lately.
[15:57:53] <basiclaser> what's your current site?
[15:58:11] <basiclaser> I'm using mobile as we speak :3
[15:58:22] <capt_blackwood> gimme one second. I'm trying to launch Ultima online
[15:58:33] <Zzaichik> me too!
[15:58:34] <basiclaser> but i am complete noob with it
[15:59:14] <basiclaser> my themes don't change when i change the theme letter :/
[15:59:31] <capt_blackwood> ok.
[15:59:35] <Zzaichik> ]jquery ui sliders don't work on mobile devices. Found that out the waste a couple hours way.
[15:59:39] <capt_blackwood> basiclaser, www.alexandersdesigns.net
[15:59:55] <capt_blackwood> ^^^ Due for yet it's 7th redesign in 4 years O.o
[16:00:29] <capt_blackwood> a much cleaner theme is probably the subsite i just made pegasus.alexandersdesigns.net
[16:01:15] <basiclaser> cool UI :D
[16:01:25] <capt_blackwood> pegasus?
[16:01:30] <basiclaser> my nokia 900 had that theme
[16:01:32] <basiclaser> yeh
[16:01:37] <capt_blackwood> LCARS FTW?
[16:01:39] <capt_blackwood> *!!!!
[16:01:46] <basiclaser> awesome :)
[16:02:02] <capt_blackwood> getting the tabs to match was interestin. It's not accurate but it matches
[16:02:24] <basiclaser> looks legit
[16:02:38] <capt_blackwood> thanks
[16:02:41] <basiclaser> except i can't read the bottom two tabs on the left sidebar
[16:03:00] <capt_blackwood> Yeah. I need to dust some crap off later
[16:03:04] <basiclaser> the blue and black aren't getting on
[16:03:05] <basiclaser> cool
[16:03:09] <basiclaser> :)
[16:04:46] <capt_blackwood> I might redue that for the Star Trek online LCARS seen on the Oddysey bridges. Various shades of golds and yellows

[16:17:52] <basiclaser> hey guys you should check out 'brackets'
[16:18:12] <basiclaser> i just downloaded it, a nice open source htmlcssjavascript editor
[16:19:35] <basiclaser> reminds me of sublime text
[16:21:33] <sebastia_> hi guys, if I use .unbind() in an element should I expect it to unobserve events even if they aren't hooked by jquery code?
[16:28:16] <newcandy> Hi everybody. Is there anyone familiar with Jcrop around? I've never touched javascript/jquery before, and I'm having a hard time sorting out a scaling issue. Case: User uploads a picture (1000px wide, 700px high). The content area of the page where the image (with Jcrop) is shown is only 500px wide. Jcrop has got a boxWidth and boxHeight variable, and those are set to 500px and 400px. Problem:
[16:28:16] <newcandy> When cropping server-side, Jcrop has sent the wrong "x"-"y" coordinates because it based it on the original size, not the new 500px width one.
[16:28:39] <newcandy> So question; could anyone show me how to do some mathematics to make sure the correct X-Y coords are sent? :)
[16:33:29] <boytoy> basiclaser: yep
[16:34:57] <andress_> is it possible to refresh a div with information via ajax?
[16:35:26] <tw2113> isn't that the point of ajax?
[16:35:39] <tw2113> or at least one of many
[16:38:26] <newcandy> Let me rephrase. How can I get the actual width of an imagefile,then divide by boxWidth variable.
[16:43:54] <andress_> actually i need to refresh the content of a div upon submitting a form
[16:44:04] <andress_> im wondering what function i should use
[16:46:27] <tw2113> you replace the div contents inside the ajax success handler
[16:49:28] <chilversc> newcandy: looks like its a html5 thing, naturalHeight and naturalWidth
[16:49:33] <chilversc> newcandy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/HTMLImageElement
[16:49:56] <newcandy> chilversc, thanks!
[16:50:02] <chilversc> newcandy: combined with the actual rendering size width & height calculating the scaling ratio for each would be simple
[16:50:28] <chilversc> newcandy: but you have to account for not all browsers having those attributes, and if the value isn't available on ones that do support it you'll get back 0
[16:50:49] <newcandy> ah
[17:12:12] <andress_> isnt this suppose to bring me the content of #logEmployees...  $container.load("addaddressesController.php #logEmployees");
[17:19:23] <jeffreylevesque> if I save an event ( .bind(click...) ) as a global variable: next.bind('click', function(e) { window.flag = jQuery.Event(e); }, can I unbind flag from another function?
[17:24:37] <say2joe1> jeffreylevesque: remove the function from the bind.
[17:24:58] <say2joe1> use a labeled (non-anonymous) function to bind / unbind.
[17:25:31] <say2joe1> var bindFn = function(e) { window.flag = jQuery.Event(e); };
[17:26:06] <say2joe1> next.bind('click',bindFn); -or- next.unbind('click',bindFn);
[17:27:03] <say2joe1> however, you could always just do window.flag = function(){}; to remove the functionality.
[17:27:24] <jeffreylevesque> Ok, I'll give that a shot
[17:28:22] <say2joe1> or, you can simply do delete window.flag if you don't want flag anymore… but, that would throw an error if another piece of code tries to access window.flag.
[17:28:38] <jeffreylevesque> i created window.flag
[17:28:49] <jeffreylevesque> hoping that I can access that event from another function
[17:29:16] <jeffreylevesque> I'm building my own slideshow rotator
[17:29:20] <jeffreylevesque> but I have a collision
[17:29:37] <aFeijo> hi folks
[17:29:49] <jeffreylevesque> clicking next on slide b, takes you to slide c.. then if you hover over slide b
[17:29:51] <jeffreylevesque> it goes blank
[17:29:54] <jeffreylevesque> if that makes sense
[17:30:02] <jeffreylevesque> just in general
[17:30:12] <aFeijo> I'm using the google geocoder.geocode({}, callback), I need to wait the callback to run to continue my code. How can I do that?
[17:30:22] <jeffreylevesque> if you hover over slide b "thumbnail"
[17:30:29] <say2joe1> oh. well, be careful of namespacing. you may, instead, want to create a jquery plugin and not use window.flag, but rather a scoped variable (flag) within the context and scope of the plugin.
[17:31:04] <say2joe1> in other words, you may not want to extend window (with window.flag)
[17:31:41] <CrazyZurfer> guys, i'm trying to use autocomplete from jquery mobile using external json, I can get the JSON, this way autocomplete.php?tipo=colegios&input={Search Input}, so how can I do to put this in the "Source Argument" I've tried this, but doesn't work: source:"autocompletado.php?tipo=colegio&input=",,
[17:34:28] <jeffreylevesque> say2joe1: is this illegal syntax -- bindFn = function control_next_prev() { next.bind('click', function(e) { window.flag = jQuery.Event(e);  // . . . }); }
[17:37:22] <thirdender1> I'm trying to trigger namespaced custom events (element.trigger("myEvent.myNamespace")). jQuery 1.4.4 catches "myEvent" (.bind("myEvent")), but 1.9.1 fails to catch anything unless I explicitly include the namespace in the event name (.bind("myEvent.myNamespace")). Am I doing anything wrong?
[17:48:12] <say2joe1> jeffreylevesque: its a little odd. you're hoisting control_next_prev function and assigning it to the variable bindFn. You should probably do a jsfiddle or bin.
[17:48:44] <raj> I want to make a new object that isn't pointing to the previous object, how can I do this?

[17:50:12] <say2joe1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7574054/javascript-how-to-pass-object-by-value
[17:50:22] <andress_> is there something wrong with this function.. im trying to load the content after submitting http://jsfiddle.net/gQ7tm/

[17:52:16] <raj> checking, thanks

[17:55:53] <mishugana> hi there
[17:56:29] <mishugana> http://pecalabs.com/experimental/
[17:56:34] <mishugana> strange bug on this site
[17:56:53] <mishugana> an animation's complete seems to be firing too soon
[17:57:27] <coldhead> many men suffer the same problem
[17:57:53] <mishugana> for example, going to the top investors tab and then to insurance reimbursment, the secondary menu that sticks to the top only transitions to market strategy
[17:58:45] <raj> it's the sympathetic excitement coldhead
[17:58:47] <raj> fyi
[17:58:53] <mishugana> that stems fromt he fact that the animation of the page's scroll isnt finished when the function call to change the menu to the correct section happens
[17:58:59] <raj> trying concentrating on your breathing rate
[17:59:02] <raj> *try
[17:59:15] <tw2113> *winces*
[17:59:37] <raj> or rub cocaine on your cock
[17:59:47] <raj> but that will cause erection problems as well
[18:00:09] <mishugana> ughhhh
[18:00:13] <mishugana> i hate numbnesssss
[18:00:30] <coldhead> well that went downhill quickly
[18:00:49] <mishugana> putting cocaine on the penis can cause a priapism
[18:00:53] <mishugana> or whatever they are called
[18:01:08] <coldhead> great to know, thanks #jQuery
[18:01:23] <mishugana> gangreen and falls off, taking you out of the gene pool
[18:01:26] <raj> mishugana, yes it can
[18:01:52] <mishugana> anyway
[18:02:08] <mishugana> any ideas on what im doing wrong
[18:02:16] <mishugana> and i dont mean in bed
[18:07:08] <katsh> if i have a string of html, how do it make it into a jquery object so i can append it to the dom and have events binded to it
[18:07:20] <katsh> without using 'on'
[18:12:31] <jeffreylevesque> how do you 'unbind' a fadeOut() method, is there soemthing equivalent?
[18:14:29] <zubelgenubi> Anyone know if there's a new/better way to do splitviews in jq mobile 3.0?
[18:16:25] <zubelgenubi> The only option Ive found so far is to rev engineer the 2.0 docs
[18:16:45] <zubelgenubi> or use a plugin, which I don't really want to
[18:28:13] <wrapper_> ?
[18:40:16] <wrapper_> how can i avoid loading an entire page inside an element? instead i need to load just part of the page.. i have tried $container.load("editemployeesController.php #logEmployees"); but is not doing it
[18:40:17] <Wolfed> Is there an easy way to dim out a selector with jqueryui? O.o
[18:41:03] <coldhead> wrapper_: that is the correct way to do it
[18:41:07] <coldhead> are you sure that ID is valid?
[18:41:10] <LocalPCGuy> wrapper_ to load part of a page, jQuery still has to request the entire page (it needs the file) and then parse out for just the part you want
[18:41:16] <coldhead> try some other selector to test, like a or p or h1
[18:41:35] <wrapper_> coldhead:  ok
[18:43:29] <wrapper_> coldhead:  no matter what selector i use it always shows the entire page inside the element
[18:45:43] <coldhead> wrapper_: http://jsfiddle.net/gpNeq/
[18:45:43] <wrapper_> what might be causing this
[18:45:46] <coldhead> that's a working example
[18:46:01] <coldhead> i am loading jsfiddle.com and selecting JUST a single link by ID
[18:46:16] <wrapper_> coldhead:  let me edit the jsfiddle to show you
[18:46:59] <coldhead> please
[18:47:47] <wrapper_> coldhead:  this is what i have done so far http://jsfiddle.net/gpNeq/1/
[18:48:39] <coldhead> wrapper_: use a relative path, not absolute URL
[18:48:43] <coldhead> so get rid of the localhost bit
[18:48:53] <coldhead> and you need a space before the selector
[18:49:03] <coldhead> .load('somurl #selector')
[18:49:10] <coldhead> not .load('somurl#selector')
[18:49:20] <wrapper_> coldhead:  you mean id+ "#bla"
[18:49:37] <coldhead> i'm not sure what i mean
[18:49:45] <coldhead> i just know .load() wants a string with two parts
[18:49:52] <coldhead> an url and a selector
[18:49:56] <wrapper_> i see
[18:49:58] <coldhead> separated by a space
[18:50:03] <coldhead> and i don't see yur space
[18:50:05] <coldhead> my code had the space
[18:50:09] <coldhead> and it worekd out great
[18:50:21] <coldhead> we're still talkin about how great it worked out
[18:52:32] <coldhead> yup it sure worked out great
[18:53:15] <wrapper_> damn idk what might be wrong
[18:54:00] <LocalPCGuy> `shakehead
[18:54:59] <coldhead> wrapper_: http://jsfiddle.net/gpNeq/2/
[18:55:06] <coldhead> i would try to write it more like that for readability
[18:55:11] <coldhead> and so you can see what's being logged
[18:55:24] <coldhead> then i'd check that that ID really really truly exists in the page you're loading
[18:55:33] <coldhead> AND that the page is valid html
[18:56:37] <wrapper_> excelentt
[18:56:40] <wrapper_> i did it
[18:56:56] <coldhead> why don't you take all the credit then
[18:57:23] <wrapper_> coldhead: lol yes.. thanks.. the problem was with the string
[18:57:27] <wrapper_> i needed a space
[18:58:06] <tw2113> damn space
[18:58:13] <LocalPCGuy> haha
[18:58:17] <coldhead> i do dimly remember someone saying something about the space
[18:58:30] <coldhead> some bright eyed bushy bearded hero
[18:58:39] <coldhead> in fact i seem to remember he droned on and on about it
[18:58:46] <coldhead> as though he felt that were the entire problem
[18:58:55] <coldhead> i don't know who that hero was but i do know that i love him
[18:59:03] <coldhead> and i want to be more like him
[19:00:12] * coldhead shudders
[19:06:28] <binaryfus10nz_> is there an optimal way to write 		$(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().prev('div.optionWrap').removeClass('active');  that always works?
[19:06:47] <Wolfed> Is there a way to pass an optional variable to a function you create on javascript? O.o
[19:06:57] <Wolfed> I think I found it.
[19:07:22] <RobW> wolfed, just check if the value exists
[19:07:28] <LocalPCGuy> binaryfus10zn_  $(this).parents('.optionWrap').removeClass('active');
[19:07:41] <RobW> function myFunc(myParam) { if(typeof myParam == null) myParam = defaultValue; }
[19:07:44] <RobW> or whatever
[19:08:30] <LocalPCGuy> binaryfus10zn_  if there is ever a chance that ('.optionWrap') could have more than 1 match (parents is greedy and will continue matching up to the body) you can add .eq(0) right before the removeClass()
[19:10:18] <Wolfed> RobW Yeah. Just figured it out :P
[19:12:11] <sheilablackrose> hi how can i animate an image to jump in or roll in?
[19:14:01] <Wolfed> Is there anyway to call parents dynamically.
[19:14:04] <Wolfed> ?
[19:14:12] <Wolfed> Let me rephrase that
[19:14:27] <LocalPCGuy> please
[19:14:29] <Wolfed> Is there anyway to call parent().parent() without typing it twice? like 2*parent()
[19:14:35] <LocalPCGuy> parents
[19:14:44] <LocalPCGuy> ?parents
[19:15:09] <veQue> sheilablackrose i dont know exactly what you want but if you want more that a straight line you will probably need to use something like an equation
[19:15:20] <LocalPCGuy> bo-t ? parents @ Wolfed
[19:15:28] <LocalPCGuy> meh, I give up
[19:15:39] <Wolfed> lol
[19:15:50] <Wolfed> Yeah I read it, but doesnt quiet know the trick
[19:16:07] <Wolfed> As I don't know the selector of the parent I need but I do know its the third for example
[19:16:27] <veQue> sheilablackrose: is there an example on the web you are trying to mimic?
[19:16:31] <LocalPCGuy> parents() will continue up the dom and grab everything that matches the selector you give it
[19:16:48] <LocalPCGuy> closest will find the first parent that matches the selector you give it
[19:17:03] <LocalPCGuy> closest is nice if you only ever want 1 element
[19:17:22] <veQue> btw i just installed sublime text 2, so far it exceeds expectations
[19:17:25] <LocalPCGuy> $(this).closest('.selector')
[19:17:28] <Wolfed> Yeah, but as I mentioned, I don't know the selector I want. I know its the 3rd parent.
[19:17:39] <LocalPCGuy> jsfiddle?
[19:17:43] <Wolfed> Just to say, trying to make a general function
[19:17:47] <LocalPCGuy> is there a class on it?
[19:18:08] <Wolfed> I need to dinamically get the nth parent sort of speaking.
[19:18:13] <LocalPCGuy> you probably shouldn't rely on the DOM to never change (i.e. that it will always be 3 parents up)
[19:18:16] <Wolfed> Not a parent I know the selector or what else
[19:18:35] <LocalPCGuy> you could just do parents().eq(#) :shrug:
[19:18:48] <Wolfed> I have always found it curious.
[19:19:04] <Wolfed> Why shouldnt I rely on the DOM I wrote?
[19:19:43] <LocalPCGuy> just not good practice, what if you start working in a team?  Or don't control the DOM (i.e. CMS output, etc.)
[19:20:00] <renatoROS3> Hi, Guys!
[19:20:06] <Wolfed> So its more as a good practice?
[19:20:24] <Wolfed> I am and will be the solely writer of my webpage :P
[19:20:26] <YourA1gebra> evening
[19:20:32] <RobW> Wolfed: then do as you please
[19:20:52] <LocalPCGuy> just saying it isn't good practice.  I don't really care if you actually follow that advice :P
[19:20:55] <Wolfed> Thought there was a deeper reason
[19:21:03] <LocalPCGuy> not reusable
[19:21:09] <LocalPCGuy> there are lots of reasons
[19:21:27] <YourA1gebra> having an issue accessing data from a select, html: http://pastebin.com/KgPdz8Hg  jquery: http://pastebin.com/S44ZHqKw not sure where it's going wrong
[19:21:30] <LocalPCGuy> have to refactor your JS if you change your dom
[19:21:36] <LocalPCGuy> etc.
[19:22:07] <LocalPCGuy> but .parents().eq(2) should get the 3rd parent
[19:22:18] <RobW> YourA1gebra: use jsfiddle please
[19:22:22] <YourA1gebra> k
[19:23:00] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/qMUNe/1/
[19:24:01] <RobW> YourA1gebra: $(this).find(':selected').data('managerid') is wrong.
[19:24:29] <RobW> wait nvm
[19:24:50] <YourA1gebra> figured it out
[19:24:50] <RobW> use .filter(":selected") :D
[19:24:51] <YourA1gebra> var traineeEmailAddr = $(this).find(':selected').data().traineeemailaddress;
[19:25:02] <YourA1gebra> why?
[19:25:26] <RobW> :selected is a jquery extension and not part of css spec
[19:25:37] <RobW> sooooooooooo, it takes a performance hit
[19:25:45] <YourA1gebra> but it does the same thing though
[19:25:45] <RobW> (native dom querySelectorAll)
[19:26:01] <YourA1gebra> $this.filter(":selected")
[19:26:03] <YourA1gebra> ya?
[19:26:09] <RobW> just replace .find with .filter
[19:26:22] <LocalPCGuy> find and filter do different things, can trip you up
[19:26:30] <RobW> but yes it's the same thing.. here I found source of info..
[19:26:34] <RobW>      Because :selected is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :selected cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method. To achieve the best performance when using :selected to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use .filter(":selected").
[19:26:45] <LocalPCGuy> find will look in the children elements and give you the matches
[19:27:05] <LocalPCGuy> filter gives you the matches from within the jquery collection you run it on
[19:27:14] <YourA1gebra> so filter is preferred
[19:27:31] <renatoROS3> Hey, guys. I'm new to this community. As a request from the teacher of the university I study, me and my colleague need to get involved and contribute fixing code or adding new feature to an open source software. We discussed about the software we would choose, and we decided to choose jQuery. Are there any advices for us? We read that the first thing we need to do is to fill a bug report. But is it also possible that we search fo
[19:27:41] <LocalPCGuy> depends on the situation - filter ONLY works if the element you are looking for is IN the collection already
[19:27:47] <RobW> hm. i don't understand  var traineeEmailAddr = $(this).find(':selected').data().traineeemailaddress;
[19:27:59] <JBlitzen> renatoROS3, your comment was truncated at "possible that we search fo"
[19:28:01] <RobW> why you're not using .data('traineeemailaddress')? looks weird heh
[19:28:24] <RobW> you could always console.log($(this).filter(":selected").data())
[19:28:31] <RobW> maybe the key's get lowercased.. I don't deal with .data much
[19:28:32] <renatoROS3> But is it also possible that we search for a bug and volunteer to take it?
[19:28:38] <LocalPCGuy> so $(':input').filter(':selected') would work (although that isn't very optimal)
[19:28:58] <YourA1gebra> i was using it that way
[19:29:00] <YourA1gebra> but it wasn't working
[19:29:08] <RobW> LocalPCGuy .filter for :selected is more optimal than .find
[19:29:19] <RobW> supposedly
[19:29:22] <LocalPCGuy> No...they are DIFFERENT functions
[19:29:32] <RobW> LocalPCGuy: see additional notes: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[19:29:36] <LocalPCGuy> they should be used in different ways
[19:29:58] <RobW> in a <select>, there will always be a :selected in the collection
[19:30:04] <RobW> if not, 1/0
[19:30:22] <YourA1gebra> so what about if I'm loading the data
[19:30:26] <YourA1gebra> right now, I'm only populating based on chage
[19:30:29] <YourA1gebra> change***
[19:30:44] <YourA1gebra> what if it loads up and I need to get the data after it's loaded
[19:30:49] <YourA1gebra> *newb
[19:30:56] <RobW> huh?
[19:30:59] <JBlitzen> renatoROS3, not sure where to look for stuff like that, I'm not into the whole open source thing
[19:31:06] <RobW> in your example, you're using CF to output the options
[19:31:10] <YourA1gebra> I'm new
[19:31:14] <YourA1gebra> yes
[19:31:22] <RobW> check the actual html source
[19:31:30] <YourA1gebra> i do
[19:31:39] <RobW> it's more helpful if you post the html source to us instead of cf next time
[19:31:40] <YourA1gebra> and i see data-email="myemail@blah.com"
[19:31:44] <YourA1gebra> k
[19:31:45] <renatoROS3> JBlitzen: Ohh, do you know if the development team come here often?
[19:31:48] <RobW> ah ok.. well
[19:31:56] <RobW> YourA1gebra: console.log($elem.data())
[19:31:57] <RobW> :D
[19:32:03] <RobW> and use firebug
[19:32:08] <JBlitzen> renatoROS3, if they do I'm unaware of
[19:32:10] <JBlitzen> it
[19:32:15] <JBlitzen> I'm also unclear on whether jquery is open source
[19:32:21] <JBlitzen> As such
[19:32:23] <LocalPCGuy> jquery is open source
[19:32:24] <dcherman> JBlitzen: its pretty open.
[19:32:39] <JBlitzen> nod, but dunno if they accept third party contributions
[19:32:52] <LocalPCGuy> there is a #jquery-dev (?) channel I believe
[19:33:01] <LocalPCGuy> they do if it adds to the project
[19:33:03] <dcherman> JBlitzen: they absolutely do, assuming the contribution is in line with the goals for jquery core ( and up to par of course )
[19:33:04] <JBlitzen> Ah, yep, good call
[19:33:10] <JBlitzen> renatoROS3 ^
[19:33:30] <RobW> there's also bug triage: v
[19:33:31] <RobW> http://contribute.jquery.org/triage/
[19:33:42] <renatoROS3> In the getting involved document, they say we need to fill a bug report and volunteer to fix it. Do you guys know if this volunteer request is made in the report? Can I search for bugs already reported?
[19:34:15] <renatoROS3> Can I volunteer to fix bugs already reported?*
[19:34:24] <LocalPCGuy> sure
[19:34:28] <JBlitzen> renatoROS3, read what Rob and LocalPCGuy just said
[19:34:37] <LocalPCGuy> I wouldn't voluteer for bugs that are already fixed though :P
[19:34:43] <renatoROS3> oh
[19:34:49] <YourA1gebra> http://jsfiddle.net/nWjr6/
[19:35:42] <YourA1gebra> http://jsfiddle.net/nWjr6/1/
[19:35:43] <YourA1gebra> sorry
[19:36:05] <YourA1gebra> problem I have, is that when they load up the app, there has to be a way to set those fields right out the gate
[19:37:18] <YourA1gebra> also, using filter didn't work for me
[19:40:40] <LocalPCGuy> you have to run the function manually on load once
[19:40:54] <LocalPCGuy> if you want JavaScript to fill them in on load
[19:41:26] <YourA1gebra> is there an on ready for a particular div
[19:41:29] <YourA1gebra> like, when that select loads
[19:41:32] <YourA1gebra> could I then populate
[19:42:49] <LocalPCGuy> RobW - "first select the elements using a pure CSS selector" (from the filter page additional notes)
[19:43:22] <LocalPCGuy> RobW so to USE filter, in the change function for a select element, you would need to do $(this).find('option').filter(':selected')
[19:43:50] <LocalPCGuy> filter works on the options found by the find
[19:44:11] <LocalPCGuy> where find works on children elements of the $(this)
[19:44:57] <LocalPCGuy> and when I say children, I mean the DOM children (in this case, the option tags in a select)
[19:44:58] <RobW> here: http://jsfiddle.net/nWjr6/3/
[19:45:02] <RobW> screw all the filtering/finding
[19:45:12] <RobW> buahah
[19:45:26] <LocalPCGuy> regardless, it is important to understand the difference
[19:45:47] <RobW> oh also, YourA1gebra, you can append .change() to your .on() function to fire the .on('change') :]
[19:45:55] <YourA1gebra> what?!
[19:46:04] <RobW> MIND BLOW
[19:46:06] <RobW> +n
[19:46:50] <YourA1gebra> so, does your fiddle load the fields without having to change it?
[19:47:15] <LocalPCGuy> um...load it and see?
[19:47:15] <RobW> yes
[19:47:19] <RobW> click the link?
[19:47:20] <LocalPCGuy> heh
[19:47:27] <RobW> (sadface.jpg)
[19:47:38] <YourA1gebra> I did
[19:47:43] <YourA1gebra> that's why I'm confused
[19:48:04] <LocalPCGuy> then you should know the answer - but take the .change() off the line 23 and see if it still loads on load
[19:48:54] <YourA1gebra> line 23?
[19:48:58] <RobW> oh jesus
[19:49:24] <YourA1gebra> ooh
[19:49:25] <YourA1gebra> haha
[19:49:25] <YourA1gebra> oof
[19:50:18] <YourA1gebra> it sure doesn't work
[19:50:21] <YourA1gebra> if you remove line 23
[19:50:42] <RobW> you can chain functions on jquery objects
[19:50:53] <YourA1gebra> so it's safe to leave that .onchange
[19:51:12] <RobW> everything you see in the preview window won't work without how it is right now.. which is pretty much the right way
[19:51:22] <RobW> but it will obviously need modification to however you want to use it
[19:51:37] <RobW> this is just for learning.. read the lines, see the ID's, etc. :D
[19:51:38] <YourA1gebra> what other modification would that need?
[19:51:48] <RobW> you'd need to put your hidden fields back in for one.. lol
[19:51:54] <YourA1gebra> well duh hahahaha
[19:52:37] <YourA1gebra> there's a problem with the drop down in that last fiddle
[19:52:39] <YourA1gebra> i can't change it
[20:02:22] <aFeijo> how can I implement in my function my own callback
[20:02:24] <aFeijo> ?
[20:02:36] <axebox> pass it in and reference it
[20:02:55] <axebox> make sure its a function, too. $.isFunction
[20:06:05] <aFeijo> thanks, too bad he left so soon :/
[20:06:19] <coldhead> that is the saddest thing :(
[20:06:23] <aFeijo> heh
[20:13:35] <beachandbytes> hows it
[20:18:36] <coldhead> mild
[20:18:39] <coldhead> bloody mild
[20:22:38] <wrapper_> this corona is not tasting really good
[20:26:00] <coldhead> did you put a lemon wedge in it?
[20:26:19] <danheberden> coldhead, you misspelled lime
[20:26:27] <LocalPCGuy> haha...just thinking that
[20:26:50] <coldhead> listen buddy, citrus is citrus
[20:27:15] <coldhead> apparently if you look at a seed for a citrus plant you CANNOT tell what it will grow into
[20:27:21] <coldhead> AND IN MY CASE I GOT LEMONS
[20:27:25] <coldhead> SO THAT'S WHAT GOES IN MY BEER
[20:27:36] <danheberden> you don't need to be so sour about it
[20:27:38] <coldhead> I'M SORRY IF THAT "OFFENDS" ANY OF YOU "MEXICANS"
[20:27:40] <coldhead> hahahahaha
[20:27:50] <coldhead> god i am going to be beat the shit out of you some day danheberden
[20:27:54] <coldhead> when you aren't so tall and handsome
[20:27:55] <danheberden> i think i'll citris one out
[20:27:59] <coldhead> >: |
[20:28:11] <danheberden> coldhead: i'll let you hold me, if that helps
[20:28:19] <danheberden> coldhead: when do i see you again
[20:28:20] <danheberden> ?
[20:28:28] <danheberden> april 15?
[20:28:29] <coldhead> may?
[20:28:40] <danheberden> going to jsconf?
[20:28:44] <coldhead> yes
[20:28:47] <danheberden> YES!
[20:29:00] <coldhead> how could i not
[20:29:16] <coldhead> i'm just writing it up on my diary
[20:29:24] <coldhead> "beat up on danheberden for citrus puns"
[20:29:33] <coldhead> i can't wait for the reminder
[20:29:51] <coldhead> i've selected "staying alive"
[20:29:54] <coldhead> by the beegees
[20:30:20] <danheberden> that's adorable
[20:30:44] <danheberden> i selected hemorrhage in my hand by fuel
[20:36:18] <tdignan> Can anyone suggest something that works similarly to "jeditable" but allows me to choose 1-3 stars and submit an integer value?
[20:36:39] <tdignan> basically, I'd like to submit as soon as the user selects the rating asynchronously.
[20:43:13] <Foxhoundz> Hello, jQ
[20:43:27] <wrapper_> danheberden: good song.. i would suggest innocent
[20:44:02] <danheberden> the only two songs i have in itunes are that one and "applejack" by dolly parton
[20:44:18] <Foxhoundz> What OS do you guys use to develop?
[20:44:20] <danheberden> and by itunes, i mean winamp
[20:44:39] <coldhead> i use ubuntu 10.04 for a nice vintage feeling
[20:44:53] <coldhead> i remember 2010. we were so carefree then
[20:44:57] <coldhead> those were halcyon days
[20:45:00] <danheberden> i use OSX 9 for a retro feeling
[20:45:08] <coldhead> yeah that's a good choice
[20:45:53] <LocalPCGuy> Win7 @ work; Win 8, Crunchbang Linux at home
[20:46:06] <danheberden> we should make jQuery for windows
[20:46:09] <LocalPCGuy> do a fair amount of .Net stuff
[20:46:31] <danheberden> $(start).programs().applications().games().solitaire('open')
[20:47:03] <LocalPCGuy> haha...I think you might be able to do that in the Win8 apps - developed with JS...why not jQuery?
[20:47:04] <iheartjs> +1 for #!
[20:47:38] <danheberden> oh dear this is going to get out of hand
[20:47:53] <LocalPCGuy> kept running into problems with Ubuntu, #! just seemed...cleaner and plus I needed something that ran good on my 6-7 year old laptop
[20:48:38] <boytoy> hey
[20:48:48] <coldhead> old laptop
[20:49:08] <boytoy> anybody here designing their mobile apps on pc with a js snippet to resize their browser window to 320px? if so care to share?
[20:49:31] <LocalPCGuy> I'm in the market for a new one, just trying to decide what to get
[20:49:44] <danheberden> i bet it looks really good next to his nokia 5160
[20:49:46] <LocalPCGuy> boytoy check out the Firefox command line
[20:50:08] <LocalPCGuy> boytoy and chrome has a nice extension - I think it is just called resize window
[20:50:25] <Zak> yeah, there's good extensions for that
[20:50:31] <boytoy> LocalPCGuy: cool ill check it out thanks
[20:50:32] <LocalPCGuy> boytoy on Firefox cmd line, you can type "resize to X by Y"
[20:50:36] <CodeFriar> I'm struggling to figure out why the bootstrap button groups are failing to group. Here's the fiddle: http://jsbin.com/avazus/1/ -- check the orange box. Any one have any idea ?
[20:50:36] <Zak> i wouldn't bother with a js snippert
[20:50:47] <boytoy> well i was hoping i could just put a snippet in my app.js though
[20:51:04] <boytoy> so every time i run my mobile draft.html it would just happen automatically with no need to install extensions etc.
[20:51:45] <LocalPCGuy> you have a separate page that opens your draft.html page in a popup - and you can control the popup size
[20:51:53] <LocalPCGuy> you "can" have ...
[20:52:02] <boytoy> interesting
[20:52:07] <boytoy> i dunno seems kinda tricky still
[20:52:14] <LocalPCGuy> window.open(....)
[20:52:16] <boytoy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6709408/how-to-resize-a-window-using-jquery is ff only too
[20:52:16] <LocalPCGuy> simple
[20:53:01] <boytoy> yup.. but then id need draft.html and launch_draft.html right?
[20:53:15] <LocalPCGuy> sure?
[20:53:16] <BoF> help me plz, the alex is object object
[20:53:17] <LocalPCGuy> and?
[20:53:18] <BoF> $.ajax({
[20:53:18] <BoF>    url: 'Mostrar.php',
[20:53:19] <BoF>    success: function(data) {
[20:53:20] <BoF>      var prueba=$("#results").html(data);
[20:53:21] <BoF>      alert(prueba);
[20:53:29] <BoF> how fix this plz
[20:53:39] <BoF> msg object object
[20:53:42] <Foxhoundz> console.log(data);
[20:53:45] <boytoy> i dunno
[20:53:57] <boytoy> i always say two is better than one when it comes to women but files, nah-ah
[20:54:02] <boytoy> :P
[20:54:05] <CodeFriar> boytoy: media query?
[20:54:23] <LocalPCGuy> is it just for your testing, or for the end app?
[20:54:38] <LocalPCGuy> not sure why you would want something like that for the app itself, can you explain further?
[20:54:45] <boytoy> just for testing yeah
[20:54:58] <LocalPCGuy> so my "and? so?" still applies
[20:55:03] <BoF> Foxhoundz: where? paste cosole.log(data)?
[20:55:18] <systemfault> boytoy: Once you'll get a woman…. you will definitely not want another one..
[20:55:21] <boytoy> i just want my html files to automatically resize to mobile size whenever i launch them
[20:55:33] <boytoy> id prefer not having to launch one html file in order to launch another
[20:55:39] <boytoy> systemfault: lulz
[20:57:03] <LocalPCGuy> boytoy you wouldn't have to launch the first file, just keep it open.  It can have links to various sizes that you want to launch
[20:57:20] <LocalPCGuy> or is this a mobile app...missed that if so
[20:57:56] <boytoy> yeah its the design draft for a mobile app, prior to phonegap integration or whatever
[20:57:59] <LocalPCGuy> no ... mobile app testing on PC...yah, I didn't miss anything
[20:58:16] <LocalPCGuy> right
[20:59:15] <boytoy> so im not testing an actual app incase theres some confusion there
[20:59:24] <BoF> how change to string mi var prueba
[20:59:25] <BoF> $.ajax({
[20:59:26] <BoF>    url: 'Mostrar.php',
[20:59:27] <BoF>    success: function(data) {
[20:59:28] <BoF>      var prueba=$("#results").html(data);
[20:59:38] <Zak> please don't paste code in here
[20:59:42] <BoF> sorri
[20:59:50] <LocalPCGuy> window.resizeTo(x,y) is the real answer, but doesn't work in most browsers due to security reasons
[21:00:03] <Zak> boytoy: i suggest you go and look into TestSwarm
[21:00:16] <CodeFriar> BoF: I think you probbly want load
[21:00:19] <Zak> set up automated testing on the proper device
[21:00:20] <CodeFriar> bof not ajax
[21:00:30] <BoF> load?
[21:00:33] <Zak> as far as testing in development, use Firefox/Chrome and use an extension
[21:00:41] <CodeFriar> BoF: $.load
[21:00:48] <Zak> even with that method, you should be testing on the device before claiming it works
[21:00:57] <Zak> but yeah, TestSwarm will get you around that problem
[21:01:11] <BoF> CodeFriar: is the same
[21:01:15] <BoF> object object
[21:01:16] <BoF> :(
[21:01:19] <boytoy> Zak: i mean
[21:01:35] <CodeFriar> BoF: Data is an object
[21:01:43] <CodeFriar> you can't dump the whole object there
[21:01:47] <boytoy> this is just a luxury problem on my end, having to save manually resizing the browser window every time i open the html
[21:02:01] <LocalPCGuy> why does the window have to be closed?
[21:02:03] <CodeFriar> BoF: you'll need to identify a property there, and putput that
[21:02:16] <boytoy> testswarm looks awesome though, but more for actual testing kinda like browserstack and them dudes?
[21:02:18] <BoF> teach me plz CodeFriar
[21:02:29] <boytoy> LocalPCGuy: haha good question
[21:02:43] <BoF> CodeFriar: i am send a echo "asd";
[21:02:45] <boytoy> getting quite philosophical too i like that
[21:02:57] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[21:03:28] <CodeFriar> BoF: what's your native tougne ?
[21:04:46] <CodeFriar> BoF: when you make an ajax request, the data object you're passing into the success function will be a javascript object.
[21:05:08] <CodeFriar> bof if you try to output an object by making it the html data
[21:05:17] <CodeFriar> BoF: it will just be [object object]
[21:05:34] <coldhead> [Abject object]
[21:05:44] <CodeFriar> BoF: in your success function, put console.log(data);
[21:05:54] <CodeFriar> BoF: to see what that object holds.
[21:06:05] <BoF> CodeFriar: where put this?
[21:06:13] <CodeFriar> BoF: in your success function
[21:06:21] <BoF> let's me try
[21:07:47] <BoF> CodeFriar: msg Undefinied
[21:08:02] <CodeFriar> BoF: put your code in a jsbin or jsfiddle
[21:10:06] <BoF> CodeFriar: http://pastebin.com/RJ1ppf94
[21:10:15] <CodeFriar> BoF: thats a pastebin
[21:10:25] <CodeFriar> BoF: not a jsfiddle or jsbin
[21:10:52] <radiantstatic> I'm reading an XML document and have an it ordered like <parent><child>1</child><element>value</element></parent> - how can i find the value of child if I search for element with value="value"?
[21:11:03] <CodeFriar> BoF: you put your console.log() call inside an alert which won't work.
[21:11:35] <CodeFriar> BoF: you need to put the console.log(data); on it's own line and you need to look at the javascript console when it runs
[21:13:07] <krz> why does $('.click_here').delay(5000).show() show immediately? shouldn't it wait 5 secs?
[21:13:08] <BoF> CodeFriar: how run the console of javascript?
[21:13:23] <CodeFriar> BoF: what browser are you using >
[21:13:40] <BoF> CodeFriar: safari
[21:13:53] <systemfault> krz: .delay() is for the animation queue, .show() is not one AFAIK
[21:14:19] <krz> so how would i tell it to wait 5 secs before showing?
[21:15:03] <coldhead> setTimeout
[21:15:24] <CodeFriar> BoF: its listed as "error console" in develop
[21:16:33] <BoF> CodeFriar: this is the error
[21:17:23] <BoF> CodeFriar: http://pastebin.com/xfx4ycV1
[21:17:51] <BoF> type Error
[21:18:05] <CodeFriar> BoF: you have an error in your php script
[21:19:24] <BoF> CodeFriar: is for the type
[21:19:38] <BoF> i need to use split but is a object
[21:20:37] <CodeFriar> BoF: the example code you posted isn't posting any data to the php script
[21:21:43] <BoF> CodeFriar: is this http://pastebin.com/RJ1ppf94
[21:22:07] <Foxhoundz> remove alert, open development tools and it should show you the structure of data
[21:22:31] <Foxhoundz> CTRL + SHIFT + J on Chrome
[21:22:41] <CodeFriar> BoF: like I said, you need to take the console.log out of the alert
[21:22:45] <LocalPCGuy> you can always (in current browsers) do JSON.stringify(object)
[21:23:01] <LocalPCGuy> but using the dev tools is preferred
[21:43:03] <sunuslee> hi, i am using jquery mobile 1.3.0's listview with search filter and data-reveal="true", so, how can i show max 10items of a big list(100items)
[21:43:33] <sunuslee> data-reveal="true" will hides all the item and false can not scroll
[21:54:19] <rebel_yell_m> hey guys quick question about ajax and modals. So i have a modal working fine on the initial page load but when the second page is loaded through ajax the modal is no longer being opened
[21:54:22] <rebel_yell_m> any help?
[21:58:05] <sunuslee> any nice scroll for jqm's listview ?
[22:00:54] <samclemens> Got problem with syntaxerror: unexpected token illegal
[22:01:02] <samclemens> http://pastebin.com/HbXVVVtp trying to initialize datepicker
[22:02:01] <LocalPCGuy> try changing out your single quotes to non-pretty versions maybe?
[22:02:36] <LocalPCGuy> and make sure jQuery is loaded and $ == jQuery
[22:05:04] <rebel_yell_m> anybody?
[22:05:54] <LocalPCGuy> rebel_yell_m you should provide a code example in jsfiddle
[22:06:11] <rebel_yell_m> too complicated for a fiddle
[22:06:19] <rebel_yell_m> the problem im having is with modals
[22:06:21] <rebel_yell_m> and ajx
[22:06:22] <LocalPCGuy> rebel_yell_m but make sure your second page isn't overwriting your modal code
[22:06:23] <rebel_yell_m> ajax
[22:06:30] <rebel_yell_m> it shouldnt be
[22:06:47] <rebel_yell_m> im calling it with :toggle modal
[22:06:47] <LocalPCGuy> yah, I understand that, and if it's too complicated for a test case, it's probably too complicated for this channel?
[22:07:52] <zubelgenubi> Thanks LPCG, fixed the error, but didn't fix the behavior :)
[22:11:16] <coldhead> life is very hard
[22:34:24] <raj> shoky, ever since you got me to start using `var` for each consecutive variable, I have discovered various missing commas!
[22:34:44] <raj> thankyup
[22:35:13] <coldhead> aw
[22:35:34] * coldhead np: ohana - rapine
[23:07:13] <jrockjiggz> hi, i'm fairly new to JSON i'm sure i'm making a mistake.. but i am getting 'invalid json'. or rather error: Unexpected token O -- http://jsfiddle.net/Pub9Y/
[23:07:54] <jrockjiggz> even without data, i still get error? http://jsfiddle.net/Pub9Y/1/
[23:10:52] <naeluh> sup errone
[23:12:12] <coldhead> bad tidings
[23:12:49] <tw2113> coldhead, tomorrow i start my path to js ninjahood
[23:13:19] <coldhead> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/Pub9Y/2/
[23:13:30] <coldhead> what you had there was just a plain JS object
[23:13:32] <coldhead> not JSON
[23:13:41] <coldhead> JSON is a string
[23:14:02] <coldhead> parseJSON turns the string into the object, you already had an object
[23:14:10] <coldhead> i don't think i can make that clearer
[23:14:23] <coldhead> tw2113: cracking open Secrets you mean?
[23:14:34] <tw2113> picking it up from the post office
[23:14:44] <tw2113> i would have had it today but i missed the currior person
[23:15:00] <tw2113> found a "we have your package, we want your signature" note in my mailbox
[23:15:15] <coldhead> courier*
[23:15:20] <jrockjiggz> is there a ?postJSON() ?
[23:15:21] <tw2113> yeah that word
[23:15:27] <coldhead> my couriers don't even come to my door
[23:15:31] <coldhead> they get to the driveway
[23:15:33] <coldhead> fill out the card
[23:15:36] <coldhead> leave it in th eletterbox
[23:15:43] <coldhead> bastardes
[23:15:49] <coldhead> i've watched them do it
[23:15:54] <coldhead> and hurled faeces at them
[23:15:56] <coldhead> but it's no use
[23:15:57] <tw2113> i live on 2nd floor, so i never hear them anyway
[23:16:08] <jrockjiggz> nevermind
[23:16:12] <tw2113> it'll be motivation to wake up early tomorrow or something
[23:16:13] <tdignan> same thing happened to me.
[23:16:21] <tdignan> i have to go get my package from ups now.
[23:16:31] <tw2113> any time after 7:30am
[23:16:42] <tw2113> at least the pickup place for me is like 2 minutes away
[23:16:47] <tdignan> once I had to chase a fedex guy down the street for an ibook. I watched him pull up every day, stop in front of my house, and not get out of the truck
[23:16:50] <coldhead> handy
[23:17:08] <tdignan> last day it wasn't happening.
[23:17:14] <tdignan> when i banged on the door, he opened it and a waft of smoke came out
[23:17:27] <tdignan> then I got my mac.
[23:17:48] <tw2113> and yet they're stopping saturday delivery because they can't handle their finances
[23:18:23] <coldhead> the thing to do is never have anything delivered
[23:18:25] <coldhead> go pure digital
[23:18:31] <coldhead> shun the material world
[23:18:37] <aquatix> upload yourself
[23:18:49] <tdignan> that's the post office, the reason it can't handle its finances is because it's received no government funds since before vietnam and has been forced to overpay into the civil service retirement fund. technically, the government is in debt to the post office right now.
[23:18:51] <coldhead> god i am trying
[23:18:57] <coldhead> you have to believe me
[23:19:01] <naeluh> Hey I have a conflict between  http://janne.aukia.com/zoomooz/ and this one http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox but no js error but I know colorbox fails when the plugin gets called twice so I can't really tell what the conflicting script is ? Why would colorbox fail in this situation? here is the link http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site4/
[23:19:46] <tdignan> actually, USPS has the highest success rate by far with my deliveries ;)
[23:19:54] <djQuery> tdignan, WTF? they have recieved a 30% cut in revenue while not cutting expenses
[23:20:22] <naeluh> colorbox is in the media section
[23:20:44] <djQuery> far as I am concerned they could do alternate day service
[23:21:25] <tdignan> It would be nice if the government gave them some money, then they could stop financing themselves by stuffing my mailbox with coupons
[23:21:51] <tdignan> i would care less about the post office, but they're the second largest employer in the united states.
[23:22:50] <tdignan> anyway I'll stop. anyone who wants to talk about postal services can pm me.
[23:23:47] <coldhead> :D
[23:23:54] <coldhead> good to know, thanks tdignan
[23:26:20] <tw2113> my only concern is if the Ninja Secrets book is a bit ahead of my current knowledge
[23:26:25] <tw2113> i can wing it though
[23:27:02] <coldhead> a bit ahead is good, you'll learn more deeply
[23:27:36] <djQuery> tw2113, if you start getting behind read elogquent javascript first
[23:35:35] <motaka2> does anyone knows the answer to this question ?   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15095655/attaching-events-to-repeating-elements-outside-the-the-tag-while-that-event-send
[23:36:56] <veQue> how do i tell----->    $('#Unrelated').bind('input', function(event){ //code goes here });     to do ---> $('.aa').bind('click',function(){$(this).attr("id"); });
[23:37:08] <veQue> my confusion is the $(this)
[23:38:28] <veQue> even though i want .aa to do something on a click (in which a this is used) i also want it to run when #unrelated is inputted
[23:39:49] <veQue> ideally i'd make a function
[23:39:59] <motaka2> veQue: No way to use data-  like wat we do in HTML5 ?
[23:40:01] <tdignan> veQue: the code in the second function: $(this).attr("id") will effectively do nothing.
[23:40:11] <tdignan> you're fetching the id and not storing it
[23:41:06] <veQue> tdignan: yeh i'm sorry nots not my problem though assume it was var id =$(this).attr("id");
[23:41:37] <tdignan> ok
[23:41:42] <veQue> i guess i want to make a function but rigthnow the this is throwing me off
[23:42:16] <motaka2> veQue: Are you chatting about my question ?
[23:42:45] <veQue> motaka2: no.. let me reevaluate to see if i can
[23:42:56] <veQue> use data- that is
[23:43:00] <veQue> to use
[23:43:28] <motaka2> veQue: tdignan here is my question once again does anyone knows the answer to this question ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15095655/attaching-events-to-repeating-elements-outside-the-the-tag-while-that-event-send
[23:43:46] <motaka2> veQue: my doc type is not of HTML5
[23:44:05] <motaka2> veQue: It is HTML 4
[23:44:22] <BkaT> hi. in this code, why does the value not show up in the #return div? http://jsfiddle.net/ktjru/
[23:44:30] <BkaT> the input value, that is.
[23:45:47] <veQue> motaka2: sorry i wish i could help
