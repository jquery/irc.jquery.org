[00:18:11] <alturic> hey guys, is there anyway to modify an attr while keeping some of it intact? so http://blah.com/foo/bar_000.png basically (and this would always remain a constant length) the 000.png while leaving the rest intact?
[00:20:38] <arc_> i mean .. you can concatenate a string
[00:20:57] <arc_> 'http://blah.com/foo/bar_' + numberVariable + '.png'
[00:21:50] <alturic> Yea, I think I need to basically capture the current url and then replace the ending part.
[00:22:03] <arc_> if you have to retreive the base url and parse it, you'll need to use regex
[00:22:21] <arc_> i mean ... technically you could use split() but ... that's not very robust
[00:22:52] <alturic> So there's no built-in way to say "replace the last 7 (length)"
[00:24:42] <arc_> .substring() and .length and math
[00:24:50] <alturic> I basically have a url and if mouseover will be happening I just need to replace the last length with the hover var
[00:24:59] <alturic> gotcha, i'll take a look, thanks.
[00:50:51] <jak2000> hi all, how to store a intial date to a datepicker
[01:58:59] <zagaza-> hi guys, so I have a piece of code that goes like this -> http://pastebin.com/6eqzyDYJ    I am using it to automatically pick a select option. But it doesn't work on mobiles. Anyone got a clue why?
[02:52:12] <kevireilly_> zagaza-: checked to make sure $('.wpcf7-select option').eq(select_num) is what you expect it to be?
[02:54:27] <kevireilly_> zagaza-: try $('.wpcf7-select option').eq(select_num).prop(‚Äòselected', true);
[04:57:19] <djam90> Hey
[04:58:54] <djam90> I have made a page with multiple columns: http://imgur.com/NsghNG2  and I have initialised jQuery UI sortable on the entire container, choosing each of the items with class .step-field-container as the items. When I already have items in each column, I can drag between the columns, but I can't seem to drag onto an empty column
[05:03:25] <DirtyFinn> could you give us your code so we could view the problem?
[05:05:27] <djam90> Never mind I fixed it by making each column the "sortable" and connectsWith column
[05:07:28] <sim642> Is it somehow possible to modify a <select>'s value without triggering its "change" event?
[05:08:34] <jquery517> Hi, Why doesnt my toggleClass work?? http://jsfiddle.net/XBfMV/516/
[05:14:33] <DirtyFinn> sim642, try $('select').attr('value','newValue');
[05:15:03] <jquery517> Hi, Why doesnt my toggleClass work?? http://jsfiddle.net/XBfMV/516/
[05:15:21] <DirtyFinn> because you have $('div').removeClass('active'); there
[05:15:43] <DirtyFinn> toggleClass turns class attribute on AND off
[05:17:11] <jquery517> DirtyFinn, ok , but how to remove the border if I click it again?
[05:17:33] <DirtyFinn> the border gets removed when you click it again
[05:17:55] <DirtyFinn> that's what toggle means. it turns things on and off and on and off and... :)
[05:18:20] <jquery517> yes, but it doesnt work? I click on it but border is still there
[05:19:03] <DirtyFinn> http://jsfiddle.net/XBfMV/517/
[05:19:09] <DirtyFinn> there's the working code
[05:19:48] <jquery517> DirtyFinn: But now I cant jump like before
[05:20:05] <DirtyFinn> jump?
[05:20:24] <jquery517> if I click div1 it turns in border , if I click div2, this div just have border
[05:20:38] <jquery517> now all can have border :S
[05:20:58] <DirtyFinn> do you want to remove the borders from every other div than theo ne you clicked?
[05:21:07] <jquery517> yes =)
[05:21:23] <jquery517> And if I click same border again the border should remove too
[05:21:39] <DirtyFinn> maybe next time try explaining what you're trying to achieve first
[05:21:43] <jquery517> just one DIV can have border, and it should be toggled
[05:22:24] <jquery517> DirtyFinn, it should work like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/XBfMV/516/
[05:22:48] <jquery517> but I want to toggle the border too
[05:23:02] <DirtyFinn> in that case you should not use toggleClass at all. first loop through each div and remove the .active class and then add the active class to the one you jsut clicked
[05:23:09] <DirtyFinn> *just
[05:23:25] <DirtyFinn> then you need a lot mode looping and if clauses
[05:24:20] <jquery517> okey
[05:24:30] <skyFlix> jquery517: http://jsfiddle.net/XBfMV/518/
[05:25:00] <skyFlix> No need to double toggle the current obj
[05:26:45] <jquery517> oh nice =) thax
[05:26:56] <jquery517> that was pretty nice code =)
[05:29:18] <ohcibi> is there an equivalent of `one` that can be passed several event-types but that gets really triggered only once?
[05:30:34] <mcfdez87> Hello. I have a select2 field that gets tags via ajax. I'm trying to set a initial default value, but I not get results. Any suggestion please? https://jsfiddle.net/pc9q9wtw/
[05:32:17] <skyFlix> mcfdez87: why not create a $('<option>', {‚Ä¶}) and append it?
[05:41:04] <skyFlix> @mcfdez87 or would you like to select one of the loaded values?
[05:42:15] <mcfdez87> skyFlix, Solved
[05:42:25] <mcfdez87> I putted the values inside callback
[05:42:29] <mcfdez87> on works well :-)
[05:48:19] <skyFlix> mcfdez87: :-)
[05:49:30] <skyFlix> ohcibi: you could set / check a var 0 / 1 on trigger
[05:49:40] <skyFlix> That would work as "one()"
[05:49:58] <user> How to post variables as form data?
[05:50:15] <ohcibi> skyFlix: the point of `one` is that the callback is being removed after it has triggered
[05:51:18] <skyFlix> ohcibi: true
[05:53:12] <skyFlix> ohcibi: well, just create a multyone function based on my var idea and handle the callback by your self
[05:54:37] <ohcibi> skyFlix: your var idea means that there is still a callback 8-)).. i know that I can just $(this).off("event1 event2", myFunc) or similar in the callback, but I wanted to ask if I am missing some builtin or anything
[05:56:01] <skyFlix> ohcibi: if you $.fn.multyonce = function() { ‚Ä¶ you DO control if there is a callback or not ;-)
[05:57:16] <ohcibi> skyFlix: so your idea is that everytime the callback gets triggered I should check my var if it is set to 1 and if yes don't actually call the provided callback?
[05:58:24] <skyFlix> ohcibi: well, you can check the var ahead of returning a callback function
[05:58:38] <ohcibi> skyFlix: then there is still the callback that checks the var..
[05:58:50] <ohcibi> skyFlix: the point of one is that there is no callback at all.. not even one that checks any var
[05:59:34] <ohcibi> skyFlix: the equivalent of `one` just using `on` is even described in the docs 8-)) thats what i'm doing now for multiple events
[06:04:44] <skyFlix> ohcibi: http://pastebin.com/0rjMScEW
[06:05:24] <ohcibi> skyFlix: thats something different
[06:05:44] <ohcibi> skyFlix: you are limiting the number of times an event can be assigned a handler
[06:06:15] <ohcibi> skyFlix: one limits the amount of times a callback is called once it has been assigned
[06:07:37] <user> How to post variables as form data? Is there a way to do it without creating a form?
[06:08:42] <skyFlix> ohcibi: I am pretty sure you can asign my function as often as you want, since you create a new instance every time where done == 0 initially
[06:08:43] <jsparks> hi I have a function init that triggers an ajax function how can I set deferred here is my example https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d67eb1a12f526fbd8f76 my goal is to wait for ajax call without timeout functions etc
[06:08:43] <ohcibi> user: google mdn FormData
[06:09:21] <skyFlix> Or maybe anyone else in this room can comment ;-)
[06:10:21] <ohcibi> skyFlix: you are right.. your example doesnt even make sense regarding`one`...
[06:10:26] <shoky_> ohcibi: no you're not missing any builtin
[06:10:35] <ohcibi> shoky_: thanks 8-)
[06:10:46] <user> thanks ohcibi
[06:11:35] <skyFlix> jsparks: put your code in between lines 8 & 9
[06:12:15] <ohcibi> skyFlix: and again.... whatever you are trying to do with that callback-proxy-thing... your proxy is still being called to check the var... and thats exactly what I want to turn off completely... just read the docs about `one`
[06:14:22] <skyFlix> ohcibi: you could .unbind() of .off()
[06:14:27] <skyFlix> of = or
[06:15:21] <ohcibi> skyFlix: exactly thats what im doing 8-) thanks for the conversation
[06:15:41] <skyFlix> ohcibi: my pleasure :-*
[06:17:44] <skyFlix> ohcibi: you don't happen to be from germany?
[06:18:09] <jsparks> skyFlix I‚Äôm creating ‚Äúobjects‚Äù out of the Testing() function as you can see I‚Äôm returning a literal structure‚Ä¶ the so init can be public to the new instance the thing is i need to trigger when the ajax function is done inside the init
[06:18:17] <ohcibi> skyFlix: yes, why? 8-)
[06:18:41] <skyFlix> ohcibi: Dein Nachname klingt sehr deutscht ;-)
[06:19:00] <shoky_> jsparks: https://gist.github.com/antishok/2dd30d912547aaac4448  this works
[06:19:19] <ohcibi> skyFlix: lol... thats my google+-name
[06:19:26] <ohcibi> i dont even know why thats in my whois
[06:19:56] <jsparks> shoky_ I know what i‚Äôm doing i want to make private ajax function but thank you
[06:20:55] <ohcibi> jsparks: an ajax promise is an asynchrounous thing.. you cannot return values from it
[06:21:46] <shoky_> jsparks: ok... https://gist.github.com/antishok/2dd30d912547aaac4448
[06:21:56] <jsparks> ohcibi I also get that but I need to track when ajax is done when calling the public method init
[06:22:00] <ohcibi> jsparks: except you are doing what you don't want to do.. have an interval or timeout check for the value being set
[06:22:52] <ohcibi> jsparks: the moment the `then` callback is called is the moment when the ajax is done (successfully)
[06:23:01] <jsparks> shoky_ that might work :D
[06:23:13] <shoky_> jsparks: it does the same as the first, but ok :)
[06:23:42] <ohcibi> i just wanted to ask, where is the difference
[06:24:36] <shoky_> oh it updates the same gist when i update.  different revisions here  https://gist.github.com/antishok/2dd30d912547aaac4448/revisions
[06:24:45] <jsparks> ohcibi I just didn‚Äôt the first shocky gist sorry
[06:24:47] <ohcibi> i know 8-)
[06:24:52] <ohcibi> i meant semantically
[06:25:16] <shoky_> well in the first i'm returning the jqXHR object itself, which i guess jsparks doesn't want
[06:25:29] <ohcibi> no
[06:25:29] <jsparks> *saw
[06:25:34] <ohcibi> the first returns the promise
[06:25:38] <shoky_> in the second i return a new promise
[06:25:39] <ohcibi> $.ajax() returns a promise
[06:25:47] <shoky_> it returns a jqXHR , which is also a promise
[06:26:05] <ohcibi> so?
[06:26:17] <shoky_> but it's got other things, like .abort()
[06:26:26] <ohcibi> so?
[06:26:33] <shoky_> so i guess jsparks doesn't want that?
[06:26:42] <shoky_> the 2nd gist doesn't return the jqXHR
[06:26:42] <ohcibi> jsparks: why do you care?
[06:27:14] <ohcibi> its still a promise..... oO thats what interfaces are for
[06:27:23] <shoky_> it's got other things too
[06:27:23] <ohcibi> ... anyways... lunch
[06:27:25] <shoky_> like .abort()
[06:27:31] <shoky_> and if you don't want the caller to be able to .abort()
[06:27:35] <shoky_> you don't want to return the jqXHR.
[06:27:38] <shoky_> (for example)
[06:27:44] <ohcibi> ok
[06:28:11] <ohcibi> the initial question rather sounded like he doesn't know that a jqxhr is a promise
[06:28:26] <jsparks> shocky_ sorry I was way
[06:28:43] <jsparks> testing right now
[06:37:17] <jsparks> now receiving Action.init().done(function () { ‚Ä¶ is not a function ?
[06:54:41] <shoky_> then you're not returning it
[06:54:58] <shoky_> or, if Action is the name of a function then you need  Action()
[06:55:18] <shoky_> jsparks ^
[06:55:37] <jsparks> shocky_ Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getContext' of undefined
[06:55:39] <jsparks> lol
[06:55:46] <shoky_> donno what you're doing
[06:55:47] <jsparks> I‚Äôm working on it now
[06:55:54] <jsparks> I know‚Ä¶
[06:56:22] <jsparks> wait a bit I‚Äôm trying to expose the init method by not retunring it and make is static
[06:56:25] <jsparks> *it
[06:56:35] <shoky_> ugh
[06:57:00] <jsparks> as it is init method should only be called once
[06:57:05] <jsparks> so why not static
[06:57:23] <jsparks> I mean I only need to load ajax function values once
[06:57:40] <jsparks> and for that I don‚Äôt need a new object
[06:59:01] <shoky_> oks
[06:59:26] <hellyeah> hey anyone know about how to make three argument from content of array https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/15/ i want to construct similar structure like that  pls chec line 13 http://jsfiddle.net/UN5Nv/17/  is there jquery way for doing this?
[07:00:13] <hellyeah> pls some help x
[07:00:14] <hellyeah> :X
[07:00:28] <shoky_> hellyeah: no idea what you're asking, and what your fiddles have to do with it ;)
[07:01:02] <hellyeah> shoky_: i try to disable range of dates as in this example
[07:01:22] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/UN5Nv/17/ lin 13 azand line 15 do the job
[07:02:02] <hellyeah> i have to make something similar i removed character after T including T and replace , instead of -
[07:02:04] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/15/
[07:02:20] <hellyeah> but here i have to give three argument to setFullYear
[07:02:33] <hellyeah> someone said you can use apply function for that
[07:02:46] <hellyeah> do you understand the problem i meantioned?
[07:03:18] <shoky_> why do you need to give it three arguments..?
[07:03:32] <shoky_> oh it takes 3 ok
[07:03:45] <shoky_> why not call it, passing the 3 arguments?
[07:03:46] <hellyeah> yes it takes 3 argument
[07:03:51] <shoky_> no need for apply.
[07:03:55] <hellyeah> how can i call it?
[07:04:01] <shoky_> like you call any function
[07:04:07] <hellyeah> i dont know how to call it?
[07:04:12] <shoky_> how do you call any function?
[07:04:18] <hellyeah> func()
[07:04:23] <shoky_> so you know ;)
[07:04:35] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[07:04:41] <shoky_> what part?
[07:04:44] <hellyeah> call array like a function?
[07:04:47] <shoky_> what?
[07:04:53] <shoky_> call a function, pass it arguments
[07:05:00] <shoky_> func(arg1, arg2, arg3)
[07:05:03] <shoky_> what's the problem?
[07:05:24] <hellyeah> startingDate.setFullYear(element[0]); i think setFullYear is a function tahtr takes three argument
[07:05:36] <shoky_> if you want to pass 3 arguments, then pass 3 arguments
[07:05:41] <shoky_> what's the problem..?
[07:06:08] <shoky_> (setFullYear can take 1 to 3 arguments btw)
[07:06:16] <hellyeah> really
[07:06:42] <shoky_> really?
[07:06:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:06:52] <hellyeah> i got invalid date error
[07:06:54] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/16/
[07:07:38] <shoky_> because you're passing an invalid argument to setFullYear
[07:07:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:08:01] <hellyeah> it should be string
[07:08:09] <hellyeah> what it should be i dont know
[07:08:22] <shoky_> no it should be a number. look at the docs
[07:08:25] <shoky_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/setFullYear
[07:08:40] <hellyeah> so thee numbers?
[07:08:54] <shoky_> 1 to 3 numbers.
[07:09:01] <shoky_> did you even read?
[07:09:21] <hellyeah> 1 to 3 hmm
[07:09:24] <hellyeah> yeah sure
[07:09:25] <hellyeah> :X
[07:09:25] <hellyeah> d
[07:09:37] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:10:02] <hellyeah> someone is clapping here
[07:10:09] <hellyeah> i couldnt concentrate for a shoprt moment
[07:11:08] <hellyeah> understand now
[07:12:06] <hellyeah> i have a string that has year, month, day part
[07:14:14] <shoky_> indeed
[07:14:33] <hellyeah> then i need three integer in same index
[07:14:39] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[07:14:55] <shoky_> in same index?
[07:15:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:15:30] <hellyeah> list of array of array
[07:15:57] <hellyeah> i dont knopw like [[[2016],[07],[02]]]
[07:16:06] <hellyeah> i am confused
[07:16:27] <shoky_> you need 3 numbers to pass to setFullYear
[07:16:35] <hellyeah> yes
[07:16:40] <shoky_> ok
[07:16:41] <shoky_> :)
[07:16:53] <shoky_> what's confusing you?
[07:17:23] <hellyeah> then i have to reach each part of string seperated by , and convert to number?
[07:17:37] <shoky_> sounds about right
[07:18:10] <hellyeah> ah
[07:18:11] <hellyeah> good
[07:18:17] <hellyeah> i was not confused
[07:18:18] <hellyeah> hehehehe
[07:18:22] <shoky_> lol :)
[07:18:29] <hellyeah> element[0]
[07:21:41] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/19/ got the string?
[07:21:48] <hellyeah> i got the string
[07:21:58] <hellyeah> humm
[07:22:21] <hellyeah> can  i do foreach in the string?
[07:22:42] <shoky_> yeah but don't
[07:22:48] <shoky_> hint: you want to split the string
[07:23:30] <hellyeah> yes
[07:23:49] <hellyeah> actually i have an idea that parse the string
[07:23:56] <hellyeah> and when you see ","
[07:23:58] <shoky_> no
[07:24:08] <hellyeah> add the characters to array etc.
[07:24:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:24:10] <shoky_> that's good but you don't need to
[07:24:15] <shoky_> hint2: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#String_instances
[07:25:29] <hellyeah> okey i can split the string thats easy
[07:27:18] <shoky_> also you already split a string in your fiddle, so you should've known about it without my hints :)
[07:27:42] <shoky_> unless someone else wrote that code for you, and you didn't take the time to go through it
[07:29:04] <hellyeah> shoky_:
[07:29:09] <hellyeah> actualy i wrote it
[07:29:27] <hellyeah> hmm but i dont know why it printed empty array https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/20/
[07:29:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:31:34] <shoky_> why  .split(/,/g, "")  ?
[07:31:38] <shoky_> hellyeah ^
[07:31:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:32:03] <shoky_> don't make up arguments
[07:32:03] <hellyeah> to eliminate ,
[07:32:10] <shoky_> why those 2 arguments?
[07:32:18] <shoky_> /,/g   and  ""
[07:32:24] <hellyeah> replace function takes two arguments
[07:32:28] <shoky_> replace?
[07:32:34] <hellyeah> ops
[07:32:39] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:32:43] <hellyeah> it should split
[07:32:44] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:32:55] <hellyeah> it is split
[07:33:01] <hellyeah> ops
[07:33:45] <hellyeah> now it is okey https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/21/
[07:33:46] <shoky_> just stop hurrying. slow down. don't hurry to paste things here when its not working. just read what code you just wrote. make sure everything is correct. every function call, every argument you pass, etc. go to the docs of each function. go slowly
[07:33:54] <shoky_> ^ read that 100 times please.
[07:34:00] <hellyeah> sure
[07:34:18] <hellyeah> but know it works
[07:34:40] <hellyeah> but they are still string
[07:34:47] <hellyeah> at least i have three argument
[07:34:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:35:03] <hellyeah> okey i can use map here may be
[07:35:19] <hellyeah> map the array and convert each index to number and move to another object
[07:35:31] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[07:38:11] <hellyeah> i guess it doesnt make sense
[07:38:15] <shoky_> that's one way, sure..
[07:38:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:38:33] <hellyeah> at least i can find the way
[07:38:40] <hellyeah> i guess there is an easier option
[07:39:11] <hellyeah> i thought map because map can return something
[07:39:25] <hellyeah> so i can return an array which has threew index
[07:39:33] <hellyeah> arr[0] arr[1] arr[2]
[07:39:49] <hellyeah> and i can give three argument to setFullYear
[07:42:50] <shoky_> go for it
[07:46:28] <hellyeah> shoky_: https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/22/
[07:46:46] <hellyeah> i didnt use map but will it work?
[07:47:06] <shoky_> will what work?
[07:47:28] <hellyeah> i mean i didnt use map
[07:47:38] <hellyeah> function is true?
[07:47:42] <shoky_> what?
[07:47:44] <hellyeah> i dont feel secure :XD
[07:47:59] <shoky_> i'm not going to validate every half step you take, man
[07:48:04] <hellyeah> eeheh
[07:48:07] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:48:07] <hellyeah> :p
[07:48:10] <shoky_> np :)
[07:48:33] <shoky_> console.log stuff all the time , to make sure things make sense
[07:48:44] <shoky_> use a step debugger if you need to figure out exacrtly what's going on
[07:49:17] <shoky_> if you don't know how to use a debugger, ask :)
[07:49:43] <hellyeah> i guess something is wrong in my logic
[07:50:04] <hellyeah> i dont know about step debugger
[07:50:35] <shoky_> you should learn about it. but for this task it's not really important
[07:50:49] <hellyeah> damn
[07:50:51] <hellyeah> it worked
[07:50:52] <hellyeah> ahahah
[07:50:58] <shoky_> damnnnnn
[07:51:12] <hellyeah> i will show you sec
[07:51:31] <shoky_> in any case,
[07:51:35] <shoky_> if s is your string
[07:52:13] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/24/ i can parse it into number
[07:52:17] <shoky_> then... var arr = s.split(',');   bla.setFullYear(Number(arr[0]), Number(arr[1]), Number(arr[2]))     should work fine
[07:52:26] <hellyeah> still string but at least i distinguished
[07:52:30] <shoky_> it's really very simple.
[07:52:37] <hellyeah> yes
[07:52:42] <hellyeah> thats what i will do
[07:54:14] <hellyeah> shoky_: nice check this out https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/25/
[07:54:43] <shoky_> hellyeah: no good ;)
[07:54:53] <hellyeah> no good?
[07:54:56] <hellyeah> is that false?
[07:55:27] <hellyeah> dont understand?
[07:55:46] <shoky_> hellyeah:  true/false  has nothing to do with good/bad or correct/incorrect   btw :)
[07:55:54] <hellyeah> forgot )
[07:55:56] <shoky_> hellyeah: line 32 is incorrect
[07:55:57] <shoky_> yeah
[07:56:02] <hellyeah> damn
[07:56:07] <shoky_> and i donno why  you're using that array around it
[07:56:08] <hellyeah> why js didnt warn about this
[07:56:11] <shoky_> why add this array to another array
[07:56:16] <shoky_> and do gross [0][0]
[07:56:17] <shoky_> stuff
[07:56:41] <hellyeah> amateur js programmer
[07:56:42] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:56:58] <hellyeah> if you have better way pls tell me i try to apply to my code
[07:57:13] <shoky_> "lets add this into an array" should never be your default solution for stuff :P
[07:57:21] <shoky_> i told you a better way
[07:57:25] <shoky_> var arr = s.split(',');   bla.setFullYear(Number(arr[0]), Number(arr[1]), Number(arr[2]))
[07:59:35] <hellyeah> shoky_: invalid date https://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/26/
[08:00:12] <shoky_> hellyeah: if it's invalid then you're doing something wrong when creating it. what do you want from me ??
[08:00:29] <shoky_> btw how many times have you read it already?
[08:00:29] <hellyeah> okey i dont want this anything from you
[08:00:32] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[08:00:34] <shoky_> [14:34:27] <shoky_> just stop hurrying. slow down. don't hurry to paste things here when its not working. just read what code you just wrote. make sure everything is correct. every function call, every argument you pass, etc. go to the docs of each function. go slowly
[08:00:34] <shoky_> [14:34:35] <shoky_> ^ read that 100 times please.
[08:00:39] <shoky_> how many times?
[08:00:39] <shoky_> :)
[08:02:56] <hellyeah> i am sorry i got excited
[08:03:04] <shoky_> for example, i've just read it about 5 times
[08:03:28] <shoky_> the 5th time was enlightening, i tell ya.
[08:04:18] <hellyeah> okey i will keep it in my minmd
[08:04:23] <hellyeah> i need to take breate
[08:04:28] <hellyeah> brb thanks for patience
[08:05:37] <decx> hm, wonder if you could use jquerys map as a jerryrigged "template engine"
[08:05:43] <jsparks> shoky_ in order to solve the problem I had to polute the global scope with an array sadly have no more ideias please check my gist https://gist.github.com/anonymous/056362351a523fb1359a
[08:06:47] <taplar> jquery maps
[08:06:55] <taplar> ?
[08:06:58] <jsparks> shocky and the ajax call is now being shoot every page refresh too :( this is really hugly
[08:07:03] <Caz> Hey there, I'm using a lib (x-editable) that allow me in-place edition of a field and I'm facing to a problem when returning html code to the input (the lib handles itself the replacement regarding the data returned by the server callback). What's happens is when I return some html code it prints the html code instead of rendering as html. Any idea
[08:07:03] <Caz> s?
[08:07:21] <LooPVzlA> espaÒol?
[08:07:27] <Caz> I tought doing some jquery tricks to parse but no success
[08:07:45] <Caz> s/tought/thought/g
[08:07:45] <b-ot> Correction, <Caz> I thought doing some jquery tricks to parse but no success
[08:08:13] <decx> gee thanks b-ot
[08:08:19] <decx> feeling lonely?
[08:08:27] <shoky_> jsparks i'm not gonna read that whole gist.. i donno what the problem is or why you need to have globals. you can always put stuff in a function or IIFE.  just keep things simple, return the $.ajax like in the first gist i gave you earlier, don't try to do classical OOP stuff in JS
[08:08:58] <jsparks> I‚Äôm ajava programmer so :D
[08:09:05] <shoky_> yeah :)
[08:11:19] <baako> can you not use jquery and jquery mobile together?
[08:11:44] <shoky_> of course you can
[08:11:44] <baako> i am asking because i am using bootstrap 3 and jquery together
[08:12:14] <baako> but when i just install jquery mobile to use to detect is a device is either on portrait or landscape
[08:12:20] <LooPVzlA> someone have a css
[08:12:32] <jsparks> shocky_ I was calling the ajax function inside the function init method but the thing is I need a first object to fire the init method I thoug I could doit it like so: Action.init if declare init method Action.init = function(){ #calling ajax function here };
[08:12:38] <baako> jquery mobile just messed everything up
[08:12:40] <LooPVzlA> of simple initial page
[08:13:56] <shoky_> jsparks: you can..  you can also just   var init = function() { return $.ajax(...) }
[08:14:03] <taplar> jsparks: 'init' is an object
[08:14:09] <taplar> functions are objects
[08:14:47] <jsparks> yes but I‚Äôm getting a stupid error saying that init is not a function when calling Action.init();
[08:15:05] <taplar> in your github Action is a method
[08:15:08] <jsparks> shoky_ yes but I‚Äôm getting a stupid error saying that init is not a function when calling Action.init();
[08:15:16] <taplar> how are you attaching it to that function?
[08:15:24] <taplar> this.init = function() ... ?
[08:15:26] <shoky_> jsparks: then it's not a function at the time you're calling it.
[08:15:38] <jsparks> even if: var Action = function () { ‚Ä¶ }
[08:15:58] <shoky_> what?
[08:16:27] <taplar> are you trying to use Action just as namespacing?
[08:16:50] <jsparks> instead of function Action () { class code here } var Action = function () { class code here }
[08:16:56] <jsparks> taplar as a class
[08:17:26] <taplar> so at some point your doing new Action() ?
[08:17:43] <jsparks> taplar every time I nedd
[08:17:48] <jsparks> sory
[08:18:06] <shoky_> anyway if you're getting an error, make a small jsfiddle testcase that shows the error, so we dont have to guess
[08:18:10] <jsparks> taplar everytime I need a new object of type Action
[08:18:30] <jsparks> shoky_ you‚Äôre right
[08:18:46] <shoky_> emphasis on small :p
[08:19:06] <taplar> smart car class
[08:19:12] <taplar> small
[08:19:20] <jsparks> yep
[08:20:02] <baako> can you download specific section of jquery mobile please? Because I am only interested in just a small part of it which is http://api.jquerymobile.com/orientationchange/
[08:23:17] <baako> when i use the full script link  <script src="//code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script> this seem to break my responsive
[08:23:49] <baako> i believe it might not be working well with either jquery or the bootstrap 3 jquery
[08:24:32] <taplar> iirc jquery mobile will apply some classes to your body and such by default
[08:26:12] <shoky_> baako: do you need the special stuff jquery-mobile does for browsers that dont support the native "orientationchange" event?
[08:26:27] <baako> taplar, i dont need that :( just spend weeks to get this working and editing the code just to get those 3 js working together going to be a pain. Just like you can choose to download specific module like angular lets you do am sure jquery mobile hould do the same
[08:26:59] <shoky_> baako: otherwise you can just  window.addEventListener('orientationchange', ..
[08:27:21] <shoky_> baako: and if you need everything jqmobile does.. it's just these 3 files really   https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/support/orientation.js  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/throttledresize.js  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/d04308f591d4d0e58443d6a645d0cc1f599888d2/js/events/orientationchange.js
[08:27:31] <baako> shoky_, my site currently is responsive on broswers and mobile in portrait mode but when its landscapes on iphones and android
[08:28:05] <baako> the responsives is abit funny so i need to be able to detect when devices are in landscape so i can add and remove some styling to get it looking good
[08:28:17] <taplar> are you using media queries?
[08:28:40] <baako> taplar, yes
[08:28:50] <baako> i am using bootstrap 3 js
[08:28:59] <baako> which is good at telling you screen sizes
[08:29:13] <taplar> i'm not familiar, so not sure they equate
[08:29:24] <baako> but it cant tell you if its in portraint or landscape
[08:29:36] <baako> taplar, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18575582/how-to-detect-responsive-breakpoints-of-twitter-bootstrap-3-using-javascript
[08:29:53] <taplar> oh, no
[08:30:09] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries
[08:30:34] <shoky_> baako: https://gist.github.com/antishok/4dcf03d8cb69df88bccb
[08:31:29] <baako> thanks will try that now
[08:31:57] <baako> works
[08:32:03] <baako> thanks shoky_
[08:32:10] <baako> thanks taplar
[08:32:40] <jsparks> shoky_ taplar there you go https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f8a32c90648f68a36e1d
[08:33:08] <shoky_> jsparks: line 31 is executed before line  9
[08:33:19] <shoky_> hence, error
[08:33:50] <taplar> what would he need to do?  Car.prototype.init ?
[08:33:57] <taplar> for the assignment
[08:34:07] <jsparks> shoky_ ok how to avoid it?
[08:34:08] <shoky_> no he'd just need to do the assignment before calling it
[08:34:23] <shoky_> Car.init = ...;   Car.init();
[08:34:42] <jsparks> taplar I need to call an ajax function just once for all the instaces and the results need to be available to all the instances as well
[08:35:20] <taplar> never did much class stuff in js, only namespaces, so this is interesting
[08:35:32] <shoky_> this has nothing to do with class stuff
[08:35:36] <shoky_> just a timing issue.
[08:35:47] <shoky_> Car.init();  Car.init = function...;
[08:35:48] <shoky_> vs:
[08:35:54] <shoky_> Car.init = function...;  Car.init();
[08:35:57] <shoky_> very simple.
[08:36:15] <jsparks> shoky_  if Car.init(); but why if it is static ?
[08:36:31] <shoky_> jsparks: stop using that word, it's meaningless in js
[08:36:40] <jsparks> ok
[08:36:47] <shoky_> so i don't know what you're asking :)
[08:36:55] <shoky_> but it's as simple as i wrote
[08:36:56] <jsparks> lol
[08:37:01] <jsparks> nice
[08:38:56] <jsparks> shocky sorry but kind of lost here so I need to assign Car.init();  to some var?
[08:39:13] <jsparks> shoky_ sorry but kind of lost here so I need to assign Car.init();  to some var?
[08:39:27] <taplar> your defining your function, but your not calling it
[08:39:31] <shoky_> jsparks: no. just   Car.init = function() { .. }   like you have currently, just in the wrong place
[08:39:40] <shoky_> he is calling it
[08:39:43] <shoky_> but later :)
[08:39:44] <taplar> afterwards
[08:39:58] <shoky_> that assignment is not supposed to be in the constructor
[08:42:03] <jsparks> shoky_ it makes sense only after having an object instance ‚Ä¶ I can call it!
[08:42:25] <shoky_> jsparks: you wanted it to be "static", no?  so it has nothing to do with instances
[08:42:47] <jsparks> shoky_ right
[08:42:48] <shoky_> jsparks:  function Car() { ... }    Car.init = function() { .... };      Car.init();
[08:42:51] <jsparks> static
[08:42:51] <taplar> i have a question about this.   why do you need an init method?
[08:43:15] <jsparks> taplar to do things before something
[08:43:21] <taplar> it doesn't take parameters though
[08:43:30] <taplar> and i assume your always going to want to call it first
[08:43:36] <taplar> so why not just do the logic?
[08:43:57] <jsparks> taplar is just an example
[08:44:01] <taplar> :)
[08:44:24] <jsparks> the point here is the Action.init = function() {‚Ä¶}
[08:45:15] <shoky_> jsparks if you put that line inside the Action constructor itself.. it will get called each time you create a new instance with `new Action()`.  you don't want that.  that "static" assignment belongs outside the constructor.
[08:45:35] <jsparks> shoky_ so the Action.init = function() { ‚Ä¶ } should stay out of Action class
[08:45:38] <shoky_> jsparks: the constrcuctor is just that, it constructs new instances.  so shouldn't contain anything "static" inside
[08:45:45] <shoky_> jsparks: yes
[08:45:51] <jsparks> shocky I get that
[08:45:54] <shoky_> out of Action constructor/function
[08:46:16] <jsparks> I just miss a bit where the constructor is in javascritpt
[08:46:19] <jsparks> :D
[08:46:21] <shoky_> i'd just use a regular function :)
[08:46:26] <shoky_> var init = function() { ... }
[08:46:28] <shoky_> init();
[08:46:31] <shoky_> ahhh, bliss
[08:47:20] <shoky_> jsparks:  function Action() { .... }    that bit is the "constructor"
[08:47:32] <shoky_> assuming you use it to construct instances with  new Action()
[08:48:02] <jsparks> yeah right I‚Äôve to get really focus in this functional programming is way different from OOP
[08:48:16] <shoky_> that is true but irrelevant,
[08:48:27] <shoky_> JS is very OOP
[08:48:37] <shoky_> it's just not classical/class-based OOP
[08:48:38] <jsparks> I start to realize that
[08:49:06] <shoky_> tons of objects, and functions,  and some of these functions can create objects so we call them constructors
[08:49:18] <shoky_> no classes though
[08:49:23] <jsparks> I just want to avoid prototype things by returning a stuctures
[08:49:49] <shoky_> and functional programming is something else really. it's about using functions and immutable data
[08:49:57] <shoky_> with no mutable state
[08:51:03] <shoky_> or well, less of it, and more control over it
[08:53:01] <jsparks> shocky I‚Äôm starting with it now I mean a couple of days ago
[08:53:43] <jsparks> shoky_  perhaps two weeks
[08:54:00] <jsparks> all by my self
[08:54:16] <taplar> atleast you have a background.  lots of the concepts translate
[08:54:30] <jsparks> yes
[09:10:26] <baako> hi guys, can't you do something like this http://kopy.io/kROWd
[09:11:01] <baako> so when you call orientation it will return evt.orientation
[09:11:16] <taplar> what do you mean call?
[09:11:20] <taplar> it's an event handler
[09:14:43] <baako> taplar, i wanted to add it in a condition something like this http://kopy.io/de9el
[09:14:47] <baako> line 5
[09:15:15] <taplar> your not going to be able to do that
[09:15:27] <taplar> gotta change your through process to be event driven
[09:15:47] <taplar> some time in the future, maybe never, a user may change orientation
[09:15:54] <taplar> in which case that event will fire
[09:15:55] <user> hello taplar
[09:16:10] <taplar> and when it bubbles up to window, window will execute that handler
[09:16:22] <taplar> at that point, your able to do your processing inside that handler
[09:16:31] <taplar> user: yo
[09:16:36] <taplar> lol
[09:18:33] <baako> taplar, alright is they a way to grap the orientation and keep try of it so i can do what i want to so in that kopy link
[09:19:30] <taplar> what are you trying to do?  do want to do something when it changes, or do you want to do something on initial load?  or both?
[09:23:27] <baako> taplar, i want to do something when it changed
[09:23:51] <taplar> so just move your if logic into your handler
[09:24:00] <baako> http://kopy.io/08bNT
[09:24:34] <taplar> pretty much, assuming the variables are correct
[09:24:57] <baako> that doesnt seem to work but if i added alert(evt.orientation) outside the if it seem to alert the different modes
[09:25:52] <taplar> what does console.log(evt.orientation) print?
[09:26:21] <Tennis> when does ES6 become a thing
[09:27:18] <taplar> Tennis: what do you mean?
[09:27:47] <baako> taplar, landscape
[09:28:10] <taplar> baako: so your checking for an uppercase l
[09:28:12] <baako> cap L
[09:28:36] <taplar> hmm
[09:28:46] <Tennis> I got some good answers over at ##javascript
[09:28:52] <taplar> cool
[09:29:00] <Tennis> I just watched some videos about the new features in es6
[09:29:11] <Tennis> wondering when i can implement it in my existing web apps or future apps
[09:29:20] <Tennis> but the browsers wont catch up for 4 or 5 years some say
[09:29:21] <taplar> i found a mdn page on it, just wasn't sure if you were asking if it existed or if you were asking about browser support
[09:29:31] <shoky_> Tennis you can already use some features natively in browsers,
[09:29:33] <Tennis> also ES6 loader or something isnt finished
[09:29:39] <Tennis> yeah
[09:29:43] <shoky_> Tennis and you can use almost all features using something like babeljs
[09:29:44] <taplar> there may be an ES6 shim ?
[09:29:46] <shoky_> which many people do
[09:29:47] * taplar shurgs
[09:29:51] <shoky_> not a shim, a compiler
[09:30:06] <Tennis> interesting
[09:31:00] <shoky_> you can already use arrow functions, in chrome at least, for example
[09:31:08] <shoky_> which i heart
[09:31:33] <baako> taplar, so the orientation only kicks off when the device has been rotated but not when it has been loaded. e.g. if i loaded my site while on landscape it doesnt seem to know yet until i rotated into portrait and then back to landscape
[09:33:01] <profsimm> folks, is it correctly defined that I can't call append() with Node but only string/Element/jQuery collection?
[09:33:57] <shoky_> profsimm: you can call it on jquery objects/collections. not on nodes or elements or strings
[09:34:25] <profsimm> shoky_:  I mean in the TypeScript .d.ts for jQuery append is defined as *taking* string
[09:34:33] <profsimm> shoky_:  I mean string, Element or jQuery
[09:34:43] <profsimm> shoky_: I tested and it takes Text node too
[09:34:47] <shoky_> profsimm: oh the argument. you can see it in the docs
[09:35:27] <profsimm> shoky_: documentation says Element. This means I can't append text nodes, in theory. But when I do it, it works...
[09:35:29] <profsimm> shoky_:  :P
[09:36:06] <shoky_> profsimm: that doesn't mean that you can't. it just means that it's not documented :)
[09:36:47] <shoky_> profsimm: and since it's not documented, your .d.ts shouldn't have it :P
[09:36:51] <profsimm> shoky_: well it's odd there's no documented way to append text node
[09:37:17] <taplar_> baako: yup, that's why i asked earlier if you wanted on load and on change, :)
[09:38:23] <shoky_> profsimm: maybe.. but, they do actually have an example in the docs where they do just that. so... whatever ;p
[09:38:25] <baako> taplar, onload sorry i might have misunderstand what ou said and didnt reply to it
[09:39:01] <taplar> so you'll need a way to get/detect the layout outside of an event, unless it's also attached to other events
[09:39:08] <taplar> i'm not that familiar with it
[09:40:05] <taplar> ohhh, have you tried window.orientation?
[09:42:08] <baako> nope i havent
[09:42:22] <taplar> try console logging that and see what you get
[09:45:45] <taplar> ah, nvm, that's been deprecated
[09:47:44] <baako> taplar, its not valid
[09:54:50] <taplar> looks like jqmobile does a lot of evaluations with innerWidth and innerHeight to figure out if it's landscape or portrait
[09:55:34] <hellyeah> can i ask abnout code review here?
[09:55:46] <taplar> go for it
[09:56:25] <taplar> you don't have to ask to ask a question dude, just do it,
[09:56:28] <taplar> :)
[09:56:31] <hellyeah> i just try too use setFullYear get three arguments http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QymQbm
[09:56:46] <hellyeah> it is not totally related with jquery xD
[09:57:19] <taplar> oh, maybe try #javascript then
[09:57:27] <hellyeah> will you give me an opinion because not related with jquery :p
[09:58:03] <hellyeah> got my answer :)
[09:58:36] <taplar> ?
[09:58:44] <hellyeah> just joking
[09:58:47] <hellyeah> :p
[09:59:05] <hellyeah> you may suggest me jquery way for doing this short
[09:59:10] <hellyeah> thats why i asked
[09:59:17] <hellyeah> i mean if you have time ofc
[09:59:24] <taplar> what's the issue?
[09:59:50] <taplar> have to do standup, brb
[10:00:05] <hellyeah> there is no issue actually i just asked for can you review my code and is there any better way to do it you can suuggest me
[10:02:34] <baako> i dont seem to understand taplar http://postimg.org/image/lwxg4g1br/ and http://kopy.io/mpzPc the "style" in the highlighted image doesnt seem to get removed
[10:03:54] <baako> the if statement definitely works
[10:05:15] <hellyeah> i did it
[10:05:18] <hellyeah> YAY !!!!
[10:10:40] <taplar> cool
[10:11:48] <taplar> baako: looks like a bad selector
[10:12:00] <taplar> your id is inside form, but your doing #id form as your selector
[10:12:53] <hellyeah> taplar: i try to select range of date on jqx calendar can you take a look  http://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/32/
[10:13:00] <taplar> you can always check your selectors by doing console.log($(selector).length) and if it's 0 then there was nothing matched
[10:13:41] <taplar> what's the issue?  and btw, finalArray[0][0][0] is very odd
[10:14:43] <hellyeah> taplar: the structure is like arrays of array of array
[10:14:52] <hellyeah> if you have something better pls lay onto me
[10:14:53] <taplar> i know, but it's very hard to read
[10:15:16] <hellyeah> yes
[10:15:25] <hellyeah> hard to maintain also
[10:15:33] <hellyeah> but at least i can write my own code
[10:15:33] <hellyeah> :Xd
[10:15:36] <taplar> your just trying to get the year month and day of the timestamp?
[10:16:11] <taplar> you should be able to stick those strings in a new Date(string) to get a date object you can work with
[10:16:15] <hellyeah> setFullYear get 3 arguments which are number
[10:16:25] <hellyeah> i try to have those integer at the end
[10:16:44] <hellyeah> setFullYear doesnt get string
[10:16:47] <hellyeah> expect integer
[10:17:19] <taplar> so?
[10:17:55] <hellyeah> original example http://jsfiddle.net/UN5Nv/17/
[10:18:18] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FDate
[10:19:10] <hellyeah> you mean you dont need to use setFullYear ?
[10:19:40] <taplar> i'm saying new Date() should be able to take those strings and convert them into a Date object
[10:19:50] <taplar> and the Date object has lots of getters you can use
[10:20:13] <taplar> instead of going that whole multi dimensional string array
[10:20:19] <taplar> *doing
[10:20:51] <hellyeah> ic
[10:20:58] <hellyeah> i will check if it is possible
[10:22:47] <hellyeah> thanks taplar
[10:22:57] <MACscr|lappy> whats the proper way to hide something by an attribute and class? tryin to do it like so: $(".woocommerce_page_jckwds[href=#tabgeneral]").hide();
[10:23:05] <MACscr|lappy> i know its ot right, but hopefully that makes sense
[10:23:14] <taplar> $(class).filter(attribute).hide()
[10:23:14] <MACscr|lappy> the class is on a parent element
[10:23:33] <MACscr|lappy> sorry, attribute value
[10:23:46] <MACscr|lappy> https://jsfiddle.net/dfd7h0zm/
[10:24:34] <hellyeah> i understand map
[10:24:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dfd7h0zm/1/
[10:24:41] <hellyeah> there is also filter and reduce
[10:24:46] <hellyeah> humm
[10:25:58] <taplar> oh, one small change
[10:26:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dfd7h0zm/2/  you should quote your matching string
[10:27:24] <taplar> makes it 100% explicit to the matcher that the characters should be treated as literals
[10:27:32] <MACscr|lappy> but its not working in that example
[10:27:35] <MACscr|lappy> that you gave me
[10:28:02] <taplar> tab general is a child, not the same element
[10:28:13] <taplar> your matcher before was invalid too
[10:28:21] <baako> taplar, this is another reason http://kopy.io/6B56k line 1 -3 if used by bootstrap 3 js and line 7 - 9 is for jquery
[10:28:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dfd7h0zm/3/
[10:28:39] <baako> if i comment out line 2 line 5 -9 works
[10:29:05] <baako> which is why i was looking for that function
[10:29:29] <baako> will try angular and see if it does that jquery mobile does
[10:29:35] <hellyeah> have a good day,
[10:29:43] <MACscr|lappy> taplar: i see now. been awhile since i did any jquery stuff. thanks!
[10:29:59] <baako> hmmm
[10:30:20] <taplar> MACscr|lappy: just remember, in selectors spaces denote nesting.  no spaces denotes a logical and
[10:30:59] <taplar> that's true also for css, so it's not really jquery specific
[10:43:51] <Duvdevan> I need help with google analytics
[10:43:52] <Duvdevan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35017228/history-state-pushing-and-google-analytics
[11:23:50] <guideX> can I rely on async: false to block in a for loop?
[11:23:58] <guideX> I see it working, but will it always work?
[11:24:09] <guideX> block an $ajax
[11:24:23] <taplar> you should try to avoid async false
[11:24:27] <guideX> hrm ok
[11:24:48] <guideX> sometimes, I am in a situation which benefits greatly from it.. is it ok to use it say, 10% of the time?
[11:24:53] <shoky_> no.
[11:25:08] <guideX> may I ask why?
[11:25:18] <taplar> two points
[11:25:33] <taplar> first being the most important.  your locking up your logic for the duration of a http request
[11:25:33] <shoky_> the only situation that could ever possibly benefit from it is if it's in a window.onbeforeunload event handler
[11:25:49] <guideX> often times, I need to do something AFTER I do an ajax
[11:25:52] <taplar> second being, your going counter to the paradigm
[11:25:54] <guideX> this is where things get hairy
[11:26:01] <shoky_> guideX: then do it in the ajax callback
[11:26:03] <shoky_> success/done
[11:26:13] <shoky_> that's exactly what it's for
[11:26:13] <guideX> shoky_: but, wghat if I want the code to be more flexible?
[11:26:20] <shoky_> guideX: then you can use the promises API
[11:26:23] <guideX> for instance, I don't always want to update a certain panel, etc
[11:26:25] <guideX> hrm ok
[11:26:37] <shoky_> guideX: e.g.   var request = $.ajax(...);        somewhere esle:      request.done(function(data) { ... })
[11:26:59] <guideX> taplar: waiit a second... locking is exactly what I want though
[11:27:06] <shoky_> locking is never what you want
[11:27:17] <taplar> your stopping all javascript processing
[11:27:29] <guideX> at the end, I might want to like redirect to a new page
[11:27:33] <guideX> to me, this is good
[11:27:36] <guideX> no?
[11:27:41] <shoky_> then do it in the handler, no problem
[11:27:47] <shoky_> never use async:false,  forget about it
[11:27:55] <guideX> but what if, I am in a loop, and need to call $ajax several time
[11:27:55] <guideX> s
[11:28:00] <shoky_> there is no "what if"
[11:28:27] <shoky_> then call it several times
[11:28:43] <shoky_> if you want something to happen after a request, it should happen in the callback
[11:30:21] <guideX> ok thanks

[11:32:06] <hlvwrk> Halll0
[11:32:07] <Obamoose> and wolf-kin
[11:32:30] <Obamoose> I googled for 'embed youtube playlist with sidebar'
[11:32:41] <Obamoose> and a bunch of them use jquery
[11:32:59] <Obamoose> and I know jackshit about jquery

[11:33:09] <taplar> try.jquery.com learn.jquery.com

[11:33:19] <Obamoose> I tried copypasting
[11:33:33] <shoky_> worst way to learn
[11:33:44] <Obamoose> Not aiming to learn, just aiming to implement :D
[11:33:52] <shoky_> then look elsewhere :)
[11:34:02] <taplar> hard to fix if you only can implement
[11:34:49] <Obamoose> I'm creating a mock up to show an actual dev.
[11:35:07] <Obamoose> trying to figure out if I should implent it via code or just show a picture.
[11:35:20] <Obamoose> depending on how easy (or hard) it would be to implement.
[11:35:23] <taplar> ime, mockups are pictures
[11:35:31] <shoky_> if you can't code, i think i'd go with a picture.
[11:36:01] <Obamoose> http://road2.pro/

[11:38:19] <shoky_> damn liberals.

[11:47:08] <dimi1947> I am trying to get the data attributes values of checkboxes that are checked...instead I get undefined error message in the console...see this example and open the console to see what heppens when you click the button:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/1ayxvbk5/
[11:48:09] <taplar> where are you trying to get the data attributes?
[11:49:24] <taplar> i don't even see data attributes on the elements
[11:49:54] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/1ayxvbk5/1/
[11:50:27] <taplar> $(this).data('serv_id')
[11:52:22] <decx> you should be aware that - is an operator
[11:52:40] <decx> so this.data-serv_id would be this.data MINUS an undefined serv_id variable
[11:52:57] <decx> regardless of the fact that it's wrong anyway ^^

[11:54:03] <taplar> np
[11:58:16] <alturic> hey guys, I have a group of button that I have a mouseover and mouseleave function. Both "work" but is there a way to delay the mouseleave before firing? I tried doing a setTimeout but I don't think that's doing what I want.
[11:59:23] <alturic> It seems like if I put mouseleave: function() { setTimeout ... it waits that many milliseconds before doing anything... even another mouseover.
[11:59:25] <taplar> your trying to keep the leave from firing in case they go off and back on real quick?
[12:00:16] <alturic> I believe that's exactly it. Basically I want the mouseover to always fire as soon as that happens though.
[12:00:28] <taplar> i did something like that for a guy the other day
[12:00:39] <alturic> But I don't want the mouseleave to fire until Xms after leaving.
[12:00:45] <taplar> essentially what i did was on mouseenter i added a class to the related element like, 'expanded'
[12:00:55] <alturic> I seems like with setTimeout it holds the other function from even firing or something.
[12:00:55] <taplar> and then on mouseout i removed it.
[12:01:12] <taplar> but i didn't do any of the closing logic until like 2 seconds in a setTimeout
[12:01:19] <taplar> which inside checked if that class was on the element
[12:01:41] <taplar> so what that did was if they moused off and then back on within two seconds, the closing logic was ignored
[12:02:37] <alturic> Right, basically I have a <img> that's src gets altered on these two. On the mouseover it alters it from the default. On the mouseleave I have it going back to the original src.
[12:04:02] <alturic> So imagine a bunch of buttons, without a delay on the mouseleave if I "slide" the hover across all the buttons it alters the url great, but on every mouseleave of the button is swaps to the original image. It's an aesthetic thing, but still looks "broken" to the layman.
[12:05:08] <alturic> As for the closing logic... do you mean mouseleave?
[12:06:52] <taplar> ah, mouseleave
[12:11:32] <alturic> http://pastebin.com/raw/YThhh1aS - First snippet it original code, second one is me trying a setTimeout.
[12:12:05] <duch_kazatel> eep.
[12:12:08] <alturic> Both work, and the second one IS exactly what I want to happen, but it seems like the setTimeout actually "waits" 300ms before also listening again for mouseover...
[12:12:11] <duch_kazatel> where's your whitespace?
[12:12:33] <alturic> duch_kazatel Ha, people usually complain of my indentions, so usually when I paste I stripe them all.
[12:12:41] <duch_kazatel> you should leave them in.
[12:12:48] <duch_kazatel> stripping them is worse ;)
[12:12:56] <alturic> I was just sick of people complaining.
[12:13:04] <alturic> But yea, I think it's much easier to read.
[12:13:10] <alturic> obvious
[12:13:34] <duch_kazatel> there's a syntax error in that fiddle.
[12:14:21] <alturic> probably from me stripping my whitespaces, let me paste the literal code
[12:14:30] <duch_kazatel> i figured it out.
[12:15:17] <taplar> altphi: https://jsfiddle.net/d0bb3aqc/
[12:15:19] <taplar> err
[12:15:23] <taplar> alturic: ^
[12:16:57] <alturic> http://pastebin.com/raw/FRKBFV2b I don't get syntax errors duch_kazatel?
[12:17:21] <duch_kazatel> not any more.  the one you shared earlier had an error :)
[12:17:24] <duch_kazatel> nbd.
[12:17:29] <alturic> hmm
[12:18:22] <alturic> anyway, let me see how that works taplar. Does this prevent the (learning jquery) "thread" from firing a mouseenter if it was done under 2000ms?
[12:18:34] <alturic> I don't know if that's what my broken setTimeout did, but it seemed like it.
[12:18:37] <taplar> no it will still fire one
[12:20:21] <taplar> its got a bug though, :/
[12:22:59] <taplar> oh, lol, dang
[12:24:41] <alturic> taplar the bug you're talking about... is that how after 2000ms it fires, even if the mouse stays on the button?
[12:25:09] <taplar> no, it's losing the originalSrc if you hover, leave, and hover before it switches back
[12:25:33] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/d0bb3aqc/1/
[12:25:50] <alturic> I just insert my code for those... but it all seems to work, outside of if the hovering all occurs fast it reverts back to the original after 2000ms
[12:26:02] <alturic> "my code" being the var and the .attr changing.
[12:26:09] <taplar> so adjust your setTimeout time, :)
[12:27:22] <alturic> but maybe i confused you, or maybe I'm misunderstanding what this is doing... if I hover (mouseenter) a button. change the img src. Stay on that image until I leave (mouseleave?) the hovered button, at which point go back to the original.
[12:27:48] <alturic> Let me see if I can get a fiddle working with the buttons and such

[14:03:39] <markh> hi all, are there downsides to loading in two versions of jquery, if one of them is set in no conflict mode?
[14:03:55] <jsparks> hi, need a brief explanation, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b97eab2864ce22572afe I guess someFunc() at the constructor is getting override because of the return statment presence right?
[14:03:56] <duch_kazatel> sure - you're loading it twice when you may not need to.
[14:04:24] <markh> duch_kazatel - that's the only downside i can think of
[14:04:33] <duch_kazatel> i still wouldn't do itl.
[14:04:34] <duch_kazatel> *it
[14:06:00] <markh> yeah. i was thinking of doing something like (typeof(jQuery) == 'undefined'), but in case that failed, i wanted to know my worst-case scenario
[14:06:06] <taplar> jsparks: probably
[14:06:11] <duch_kazatel> jsparks normally for constructors you don't return an object.
[14:06:22] <duch_kazatel> wait sorry
[14:06:23] <duch_kazatel> 1 sec.
[14:06:25] <duch_kazatel> way out of it today.
[14:06:43] <jsparks> shoky_ any idea about it I know you know it :D
[14:07:30] <duch_kazatel> jsparks you're confused about how constructors work.
[14:07:54] <shoky_> jsparks duch knows too :)
[14:08:04] <jsparks> duch_kazatel
[14:08:13] <jsparks> sorry please explain
[14:08:47] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oy815aLs/
[14:08:49] <duch_kazatel> this is what you want.
[14:10:19] <jsparks> duch_kazatel but by doing so would not be better prototype?
[14:10:35] <duch_kazatel> you could also do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oy815aLs/2/, but they wind up effectively being the same thing.
[14:10:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:11:16] <duch_kazatel> are you asking which version is better?
[14:11:45] <jsparks> because every time the new is called a new ‚Äúeach method‚Äù defined inside the ‚Äúclass‚Äù will have to be written
[14:12:05] <jsparks> no just question :)
[14:12:08] <duch_kazatel> are you worrying about performance?
[14:12:10] <duch_kazatel> ooor...?
[14:12:23] <duch_kazatel> just trying to see where your head's at :)
[14:12:29] <jsparks> about knowing everything quickly LOL
[14:12:56] <duch_kazatel> ah - i might hit up ##javascript for some resources on that.
[14:13:00] <jsparks> trying to get the best out of the possible ways of doing it
[14:14:24] <jsparks> anyway, so taking by example my gist why this.someFunc will not be recognised as a function if return structutre is present?
[14:14:52] <jsparks> I know is all about the constructor and I get your example pretty fine
[14:14:56] <taplar> Car would !== return object
[14:15:29] <shoky_> jsparks usually in constructors you DON'T use "return"
[14:15:33] <duch_kazatel> ^\
[14:15:42] <duch_kazatel> you could if you really wanted to, but traditionally you don't.
[14:15:50] <shoky_> jsparks: a constructor used with `new` automatically returns a new object. inside the constructor you can add stuff to that new object via `this`
[14:15:52] <duch_kazatel> constructors are weird.
[14:16:26] <ashka> hi, I think I have a bug with an external library, but before submitting a bug report I'd like to make sure I didn't miss something stupid, can anybody help? here's my code https://jsfiddle.net/40vm5g4z/ , the field will not update when a file is selected but will if I put the code that's in p() in the document.ready
[14:16:48] <shoky_> jsparks: but if you explicitly return something from a constructor, then the new object that's automatically created (that you can access with `this`) is effectively just thrown away
[14:17:03] <jsparks> duch_kazatel: ‚Äúconstructors are weird.‚Äù ->  that is why I‚Äôve asked but if I do var car0 = new Car(); then I would excpect an exception or something?
[14:17:13] <duch_kazatel> jsparks nope.
[14:17:18] <duch_kazatel> that's valid.
[14:17:27] <jsparks> shoky_ exactly what I thought
[14:17:44] <shoky_> doesn't sound like it :)
[14:17:48] <ashka> nevermind
[14:18:33] <jsparks> Yes but you know I‚Äôm a java programmer many things here doesn‚Äôt look like the same! Actually very different¬†:D
[14:18:42] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[14:18:45] <duch_kazatel> entirely different language.
[14:19:17] <jsparks> Another question I have Car.init = (function() {
[14:19:17] <jsparks>     Car.color = 'grey';
[14:19:18] <jsparks> })();
[14:19:23] <jsparks> sorry
[14:19:31] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't do that.
[14:19:32] <shoky_> jsparks that part doesn't make any sense btw
[14:19:58] <jsparks> read line 35 from duch gist
[14:20:01] <jsparks> please
[14:20:05] <shoky_> (you're effectively doing:  Car.init = Car.color = 'grey' )
[14:20:08] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:20:26] <shoky_> if you don't know  what the  (function() { ...  })()   does
[14:20:30] <shoky_> then don't put it there :0
[14:20:34] <jsparks> yes it will be available for all cars
[14:20:44] <duch_kazatel> then set that in the constructor.
[14:20:49] <shoky_> jsparks no. you wanted this init to be "static" remember.
[14:20:55] <shoky_> so it has nothing to do with all cars
[14:20:55] <jsparks> yes
[14:20:57] <shoky_> static = global.
[14:21:04] <duch_kazatel> ah, continuation from something else.  got it.
[14:21:09] <taplar> :)
[14:21:22] <shoky_> sorta, duch, just using terms he used earlier
[14:21:26] <jsparks> exactly is global if static is allmost behaving like a constant
[14:21:34] <jsparks> not sure what does here :)
[14:21:52] <shoky_> if you want  Car.init to be a function
[14:21:53] <shoky_> Car.init = function() { }
[14:21:57] <shoky_> not  Car.init = (function() { ... })()
[14:21:57] <taplar> global does not inforce constant, fwiw
[14:22:05] <jsparks> Ah that 
[14:22:24] <jsparks> is because I whant to avoid colling the function twice
[14:22:32] <jsparks> *want
[14:22:58] <shoky_> why would you need to call it twice
[14:23:00] <jsparks> by wrapping function and call it right after it will be executed
[14:23:41] <taplar> then why have the method at all?
[14:23:45] <jsparks> this way I avoid to do Car.init()
[14:23:51] <jsparks> yes that makes sense
[14:23:57] <shoky_> then why make it at all if you never want to call it ?
[14:24:11] <jsparks> I wan to call it once
[14:24:13] <jsparks> just once
[14:24:19] <shoky_> then just wriet the code, why put it in a function
[14:24:31] <shoky_> Car.init = Car.color = 'grey';
[14:24:34] <shoky_> er
[14:24:36] <shoky_> whatever.
[14:24:46] <shoky_> doesn't make sense either way ;)
[14:25:14] <jsparks> I could do (function(){ Car.color = ‚Äògrey‚Äô })();
[14:25:23] <shoky_> actually sorry that's not the same as what you had
[14:25:30] <taplar> or just Car.color = 'grey';
[14:25:32] <shoky_> you're effectively just doing:   Car.color = 'grey';
[14:25:32] <shoky_> yeah
[14:25:41] <taplar> unneeded function
[14:25:46] <shoky_> you're not putting anything in Car.init
[14:25:54] <duch_kazatel> jsparks you realize init isn't a magical property, right?
[14:26:07] <duch_kazatel> and do you know what (function() {})(); does?
[14:26:08] <jsparks> anyway if i have done it that way probably I have to include Car.color inside then constructor
[14:26:19] <jsparks> yes I start to
[14:26:21] <jsparks> :D
[14:26:22] <shoky_> jsparks constructors are for creating instances
[14:26:34] <shoky_> while you wanted this to be "static"
[14:26:44] <duch_kazatel> jsparks read http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[14:26:49] <jsparks> that is right
[14:26:49] <shoky_> so, no it shouldn't be in the constructor, unless you want it to happen for each new instance
[14:27:14] <jsparks> then is in the right spot :)
[14:27:31] <taplar> correct me if i'm wrong, but can you even do a global constant in js?  i mean, if it's global, you have access to change it.  if you make it 'static' by making it scoped down and only giving access to it through a getter, then it's not global.
[14:27:47] <jsparks> but the if not provideing the scope then Car.color will not take the same effect right?
[14:28:09] <shoky_> jsparks:   Car.init = (function() { Car.color = 'grey'; })()  is exactly like doing:    Car.color = 'grey';  Car.init = undefined;
[14:29:24] <jsparks> Now I‚Äôm confused because I can get color out of any Car instance before calling setColor method
[14:29:53] <jsparks> Ok never mind let me ask this
[14:29:53] <shoky_> taplar: don't think anyone was talking about constants ?
[14:30:21] <taplar> guess not
[14:30:44] <shoky_> you have constants in es6 btw ;p
[14:31:11] <taplar> cool
[14:31:23] <g0v4> hello
[14:31:36] <g0v4> based on this screenshot alone, which site is more efficient, left or right? http://i.imgur.com/G8psCI6.png
[14:31:48] <taplar> heh
[14:32:11] <jsparks> By doing Car.init = function() { Car.color = ‚Äògrey‚Äô; } I‚Äôm addressing grey color to all instances of Car class‚Ä¶ question I need to do Car.init to call the right namespace right ?
[14:32:12] <shoky_> what a pointless question
[14:32:30] <shoky_> jsparks: no that's totally incorrect
[14:32:44] <shoky_> jsparks:  it has NOTHING to do with any instance of Car
[14:32:51] <duch_kazatel> g0v4 that's a loaded question.
[14:33:05] <jsparks> shoky_ explain please
[14:33:27] <g0v4> duch_kazatel: i aim to provoke thought
[14:33:44] <shoky_> jsparks:  you're not adding anything to any instance by doing Car.init = ...;
[14:34:02] <duch_kazatel> g0v4 that's a really terrible way to "provoke thought"
[14:34:03] <shoky_> jsparks: you're just adding a property to the one `Car` function
[14:34:18] <jsparks> ok
[14:34:21] <g0v4> duch_kazatel: just because you don't know how to answer a question doesn't make the question terrible
[14:34:33] <duch_kazatel> g0v4 that's a helluvan assumption.
[14:35:15] <duch_kazatel> and your question is strange - define "efficient"
[14:36:34] <jsparks> ok people thank you so much for all your support you‚Äôre making a better javascript programmer lol sorry for coming here with so much questions I have a lot in mind but tomorrow is another day :)
[14:36:47] <taplar> s'what the room is for
[14:36:49] <duch_kazatel> JSLint it's all good man.
[14:36:52] <duch_kazatel> err, jsparks
[14:46:27] <hellyeah> yo
[14:46:42] <hellyeah> why jquery always return an object?
[14:49:40] <duch_kazatel> because everything in js in an object.
[14:50:10] <aukeroorda> Hey jQuery
[14:51:21] <hellyeah> what if there is no markup in html about spesific element or what is i didnt create any element dynamically. still it returns an object?
[14:51:22] <z1haze> anyone use/used highlightjs here? I am having a slight issue where its not recognizing a variable as a variable, so its not being highlighted properly
[14:51:52] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah that's apart of the library.
[14:51:57] <duch_kazatel> it does that to reduce errors.
[14:52:23] <duch_kazatel> most methods will check for you if the element exists or not.
[14:52:26] <hellyeah> it doesnt throw an exception?
[14:52:40] <duch_kazatel> nope
[14:53:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:53:18] <duch_kazatel> you could check for yourself when relevant.
[14:53:19] <hellyeah> i am confused
[14:54:01] <hellyeah> !$(element).find('.smt') doesnt return falsy when smt does not exist?
[14:54:20] <shoky_> hellyeah: that's what .length is for
[14:54:29] <duch_kazatel> that's always going to be false because you're trying to invert something that's always truthy.
[14:54:38] <duch_kazatel> use .length when you want to know if a selector matched.
[14:55:22] <hellyeah> well thats the issue i dont understaqnd truthy concept i know you check with .length === 0 so object always exist?
[14:55:37] <duch_kazatel> .length tells you how many elements are in the collection.
[14:55:44] <duch_kazatel> but you're confused about how javascript objects work.
[14:56:19] <hellyeah> i think so
[14:56:48] <duch_kazatel> in javascript, everything is truthy except false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, and '' (empty string)
[14:58:59] <duch_kazatel> so even if you have an empty jquery collection, it's truthy.
[15:00:49] <hellyeah> so jquery collection is always there
[15:00:51] <hellyeah> ?
[15:01:00] <duch_kazatel> yes.  it's just a collection of nothing.
[15:01:04] <hellyeah> when you select an element with $
[15:01:13] <shoky_> he just told you
[15:01:13] <hellyeah> you just put something into that collection
[15:01:15] <hellyeah> ?
[15:01:28] <shoky_> jquery puts something in the collection, and returns it
[15:01:31] <duch_kazatel> $() creates a new jquery object, which is usually a collection.
[15:01:32] <shoky_> something, or nothing
[15:01:41] <duch_kazatel> it always returns the collection.  the collection could be 0 or more items.
[15:01:41] <hellyeah> shoky_: it is easier to understand when i made a sentence :p
[15:01:57] <hellyeah> i understand now
[15:02:42] <hellyeah> so var arr = new array[]; or var List = new List<int>() is it similar thing?
[15:02:53] <hellyeah> initializing something
[15:02:55] <shoky_> that's not javascript..?
[15:02:56] <duch_kazatel> err
[15:03:01] <duch_kazatel> ^
[15:03:07] <hellyeah> i know i just try to understand better
[15:03:15] <hellyeah> sorry okey i understood
[15:03:20] <shoky_> <duch_kazatel> in javascript, everything is truthy except false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, and '' (empty string)
[15:03:26] <shoky_> ^ that's really all you need to know here
[15:03:38] <duch_kazatel> $() returns something that isn't one of those 6 things
[15:04:02] <hellyeah> 6 things?
[15:04:12] <shoky_> in what i pasted
[15:04:17] <hellyeah> ic
[15:04:26] <hellyeah> i understood thanks
[15:04:42] <hellyeah> NaN is kinda confusing btw
[15:04:49] <hellyeah> NaN is number itself
[15:04:53] <shoky_> uhm
[15:04:55] <shoky_> it is?
[15:05:16] <shoky_> oh you mean it's "typeof" ?
[15:05:18] <duch_kazatel> NaN is typeof number
[15:05:19] <shoky_> yea.
[15:05:35] <hellyeah> hellyeah
[15:05:35] <hellyeah> >>typeof NaN
[15:05:35] <hellyeah> ecmabot
[15:05:35] <hellyeah> hellyeah: (string) 'number'
[15:05:44] <duch_kazatel> right, but it's "not a number"
[15:06:20] <hellyeah> type of NaN is number bu it is not actual number? i guess this is not jquery isse :)
[15:06:27] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:06:33] <duch_kazatel> NaN is short for "Not a Number"
[15:06:39] <hellyeah> yeah
[15:06:40] <duch_kazatel> it's numeric Not a Number - it's an IEEE thing.
[15:06:51] <hellyeah> hmm IEEE
[15:06:54] <hellyeah> never heard
[15:07:16] <duch_kazatel> WAT
[15:07:42] <hellyeah> bevermind
[15:07:47] <hellyeah> nevermind
[15:07:59] <duch_kazatel> IEEE is one of the largest standards bodies in the world.
[15:08:30] <hellyeah> sorry my english is limited may be i know the turkish word for that
[15:08:44] <duch_kazatel> IEEE is what the group is called :) not sure what they'd call it in turkey.
[15:09:04] <hellyeah> i dont know either
[15:09:07] <hellyeah> :xd
[15:11:52] <Uhkis> probably IEEE ;)
[15:11:58] <duch_kazatel> ^ ;)
[15:12:02] <duch_kazatel> it's an acronym.
[15:15:48] <stmbgr> What's better coding style - assign IDs to every single field you want to modify or just find the elements by traversing DOM tree? Should one assume JS changed along with HTML?
[15:16:12] <duch_kazatel> favor semantic classes and use descriptive names.
[15:16:17] <duch_kazatel> and use .filter()
[15:16:19] <duch_kazatel> really depends though.
[15:47:15] <PCatinean> If I do $('div.smth.active') how do I select the previous sibling without the active?
[15:47:19] <PCatinean> just div.smth?
[15:47:38] <duch_kazatel> .prev() should be.
[15:47:51] <PCatinean> but it finds nothing since I select this one with .active
[15:48:00] <duch_kazatel> shouldn't matter.
[15:48:08] <duch_kazatel> it's the previous siblime.
[15:48:18] <duch_kazatel> *sibling - regardless of what the current selector it.
[15:48:30] <duch_kazatel> do you mean you want the previous div.smth ?
[15:50:00] <PCatinean> It's just a bootstrap carousel and I have to trigger a click when previous is being clicked or next
[15:50:06] <PCatinean> And I have to do the click event manually
[15:50:13] <PCatinean> and the active one has class active on it
[15:50:24] <duch_kazatel> so you want to go back or forward?
[15:50:28] <PCatinean> yep
[15:50:41] <PCatinean> It already does that but I need to move the active class on the elements as well
[15:51:34] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9860436/twitter-bootstrap-carousel-access-current-index
[15:51:44] <PCatinean> unforunately they are not siblings
[15:51:45] <PCatinean> oh
[15:52:06] <duch_kazatel> so .prev() and .next() are for siblings.  that would've been salient info earlier.  but you hook into a different event it looks like.
[15:55:00] <XHFHX> Hi there. can somebody tell me why i can't select $('a').attr('href') from this passage? https://dpaste.de/Cq24
[15:55:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:55:24] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "can't"?
[15:56:04] <XHFHX> well, jquery returns an empty element if I just do $('a') on it and so returns nothing on .attr('href')
[15:56:13] <XHFHX> but I don't get it because it should work
[15:56:52] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajue8qcv/ works here.
[15:57:23] <XHFHX> mh
[15:57:27] <XHFHX> thats not good
[15:57:40] <XHFHX> :D
[15:58:02] <XHFHX> then there must be somewhere else the problem, thanks for the quick response
[15:58:06] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:07:46] <PCatinean> duch_kazatel, how do I say "get the sibling of the parent of the parent and drill down to the div with .class in it?" :)))
[16:08:51] <duch_kazatel> don't.
[16:08:53] <duch_kazatel> use .closest().
[16:08:59] <duch_kazatel> and then .find()
[16:09:17] <PCatinean> but there is one after and one before
[16:09:20] <PCatinean> the same
[16:09:40] <duch_kazatel> you use closes, prev/next, and find.
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[16:17:02] <PCatinean> Hmm not sure which closest() will match
[16:17:08] <PCatinean> ah wait wait go it
[16:19:01] <PCatinean> Damn it's buggy
[16:19:29] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[16:21:18] <PCatinean> When the first element is reached it should go for the last
[16:21:35] <duch_kazatel> still lost.
[16:21:42] <duch_kazatel> you might be confused about what .closest() does.
[16:22:03] <PCatinean> No, that works but when the first element is reached there is no more prev, there is just the last one if you were going in a circle
[16:22:40] <duch_kazatel> so you need to get the first if there is no next one?
[16:22:46] <PCatinean> yeah
[16:22:52] <PCatinean> and last if there's no previous one
[16:23:05] <duch_kazatel> then check .next().length
[16:23:10] <duch_kazatel> if that's 0, grab the first one.
[16:23:17] <PCatinean> ah...ok
[16:23:27] <PCatinean> Thought there was a smoother way or smth
[16:23:52] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:33:44] <meese> Question: I'm trying to display loader bar progress based on backgroundImg instead of demoImgArray but I am unable to plug it into preload(); and work http://codepen.io/meese/pen/jWzeYe
[16:33:54] <meese>  I have a hunch the function is treating arrays differently than individual vars, so that;s probably the issue, but I;m not sure what I need to do specifically
[16:34:02] <meese> (This code is based on http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mVVqQm )
[16:38:53] <PantsOfChocolate> hey guys quick dumb question, whats the best way to select a bunch of buttons with ids like button_id-1, button_id-2,etc. Like on click $('#button_id-*').on('click')
[16:38:58] <PantsOfChocolate> something like that
[16:39:01] <duch_kazatel> give them a class instead.
[16:39:03] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:39:16] <duch_kazatel> the alternative is kind of funky and very sl;ow.
[16:39:24] <duch_kazatel> well, comparitively slow.
[16:40:46] <PantsOfChocolate> alright awesome thats a good choice too thanks!
[16:43:20] <linux_daemon> hey guya
[16:43:25] <linux_daemon> guys*
[16:43:42] <linux_daemon> has anyone worked with c3ja?
[16:43:49] <linux_daemon> c3js*
[16:44:12] <duch_kazatel> not likely to get much assistance here for that ;)_
[16:45:04] <linux_daemon> needed some help on some custom mouseover functions
[16:46:02] <linux_daemon> recommend a channel for help with c3js?
[16:46:15] <duch_kazatel> no idea.
[16:46:38] <linux_daemon> f**k
[16:46:59] <meese> Updated code for my question: http://codepen.io/meese/pen/jWzeYe
[16:47:47] <meese> I want preload() to read progress of loading backgroundImg instead of the demoImgArray
[16:47:56] <meese> thanks in advance!
[16:48:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[16:49:03] <meese> duch_kazatel: Do you need me to clarify something?
[16:49:17] <duch_kazatel> " I want preload() to read progress of loading backgroundImg instead of the demoImgArray" - not sure what you mean by this.
[16:50:09] <duch_kazatel> you want preload to work with a single image instead of an array?
[16:50:20] <meese> yes
[16:50:25] <linux_daemon> crap, no help with c3js
[16:50:29] <meese> do you recommend sticking with an array?
[16:50:40] <duch_kazatel> meese are you going to need both cases?
[16:50:56] <linux_daemon> anyone knows yansanmo?
[16:51:08] <duch_kazatel> meese like, are you trying to support both one image and many images?
[16:51:43] <meese> good question. I need to decide. Can I pull an image from the CSS's background-image and stick it in an array duch_kazatel ?
[16:52:00] <duch_kazatel> meese yep.
[16:52:08] <duch_kazatel> well.
[16:52:10] <duch_kazatel> the lkink yeah
[16:52:13] <duch_kazatel> not the actual image.
[16:52:40] <meese> ok, I'd like to take one or all images in the HTML and CSS and track their progress with the loading bar, then fade into one or the entire site once loaded
[16:52:52] <duch_kazatel> yeesh.
[16:52:57] <duch_kazatel> that's a little heavy handed
[16:53:16] <meese> if I can't do both with one solution, that's fine
[16:53:19] <duch_kazatel> sounds like some really heavy images - any reason you can compress/reduce/etc.?
[16:53:24] <duch_kazatel> and you can handle both cases.
[16:53:34] <duch_kazatel> you just accept that an array of one is a valid thing :)
[16:54:27] <meese> ok, I'll just do an array of one. What should I do to treat a background-image (css) as if it's in the array for the purposes of this script?
[16:54:52] <meese> if you can point me to a function that does that, or something like that, I'd appreciate it
[16:54:54] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be really inefficent.
[16:55:16] <meese> well I'd prefer not to have to manually change the jquery code for every section that needs it
[16:55:23] <meese> on my website
[16:55:31] <duch_kazatel> $('*').map(function() { return $(this).css('background-image') }).get();
[16:55:42] <duch_kazatel> that'll get you your array.
[16:55:53] <meese> thanks
[16:56:15] <meese> would you recommend something that is more efficient but accomplishes the same thing?
[16:56:39] <meese> basically, I want to replace the visual loading of images with a color loading bar
[16:56:57] <meese> that then fades into the loaded image
[16:57:48] <duch_kazatel> why do you think you need that?
[16:58:25] <duch_kazatel> i guess i'm really confused about why you're not addressing the fact that images take forever to load.
[16:59:08] <meese> what do you mean?
[16:59:49] <meese> My purpose: to provide a smoother experience for the user. So that they don't see images until they're fully loaded.
[16:59:50] <duch_kazatel> why do you want a progress bar for all images?
[17:00:09] <meese> http://meesebyte.com/demov1/ <- a prototype of the site I'm making
[17:00:18] <duch_kazatel> why not make the images a smaller filesize?
[17:00:19] <meese> each of those sections will have a cover image
[17:01:29] <meese> I will work on filesize to get it as low as I can without hurting quality too much
[17:01:45] <meese> maybe it's best I do this loaded before the site fades in
[17:01:55] <meese> "do this" -> jquery loader
[17:01:58] <duch_kazatel> you can usually drop quality down to like 70% and then just compress like crazy.
[17:02:09] <duch_kazatel> so over the wire things are a smaller filesize.
[17:02:11] <duch_kazatel> optimize that instead.
[17:02:21] <meese> right, but they'll still visually load for a few seconds
[17:02:28] <duch_kazatel> not if you compress them enough.
[17:02:48] <meese> Do you have an example of what you're talking about?
[17:03:02] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization?hl=en
[17:03:29] <meese> no... I mean a site with cover images that aren't compressed too much, and load instantly.
[17:03:38] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating compression with quality.
[17:03:40] <meese> without a preload animation
[17:04:02] <meese> You don't understand what I'm talking about?
[17:04:20] <duch_kazatel> you're concerned that your cover images will take seconds each to load.
[17:04:30] <meese> Yes.
[17:04:36] <meese> I want a smoother experience for my users.
[17:04:47] <duch_kazatel> and i'm saying that if you drop quality and compress the images enough, that shouldn't be an issue.
[17:05:07] <duch_kazatel> and the user won't notice a difference in how "good" the images look.
[17:05:18] <meese> And I'm saying I'd like to see an example of a site where your point is illustrated.
[17:05:54] <duch_kazatel> i linked a tutorial that explains how.  we're working on image compression and optimization techniques where i work and they've helped quite a bit.  seen it help others, too.
[17:06:01] <duch_kazatel> nothing off the top of my head of your specific use case though.
[17:07:46] <meese> ok, thnaks
[17:07:48] <meese> thanks*
[17:07:52] <duch_kazatel> you could feel free to use that .map() and use the progress loader setup, but I haven't seen many people use that kind of UI very successfully.  i'd love to be proven wrong about it :)
[17:08:25] <meese> I'm a designer, so I will try to pull it off, but if it doesn't work very well I'll abandon the idea.
[17:08:36] <meese> thanks for the thoughtfulness, duch_kazatel :)
[17:08:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah, i'd focus on optimizing everything instead to skirt the issue entirely :D
[17:12:03] <meese> 1:04 PM <duch_kazatel> and i'm saying that if you drop quality and compress the images enough, that shouldn't be an issue.
[17:12:11] <meese> "dropping quality" is what I'm trying yo avoid
[17:12:32] <meese> If the website can load in, say, 4 seconds with a loader, and then all of my high quality images are there, that's ideal, I think.
[17:12:32] <duch_kazatel> so you can usually drop quality far more than you'd expect and your end users won't notice a difference.
[17:12:37] <duch_kazatel> also, compress != drop quality.
[17:12:50] <meese> yeah, but my website's main purpose is to attract design studios
[17:12:58] <meese> secondary purpose is attracting freelance work
[17:13:24] <duch_kazatel> right, but they won't notice the difference in quality.
[17:13:52] <duch_kazatel> have you seen this loader concept before?
[17:14:11] <meese> The one that I'm trying to do? Not exactly
[17:14:42] <meese> But I've seen websites that load before they show anything to the user.
[17:14:51] <meese> And if the loading time is only a few seconds, that seems fine to me
[17:15:07] <duch_kazatel> i guess i'm just so used to ecom where we avoid that as much as possible.
[17:15:11] <duch_kazatel> time == money for us.
[17:15:28] <duch_kazatel> people hate waiting - they click and link and don't see content, they close the browser.
[17:16:18] <meese> that's my main hesitation with what I'm trying to do, that they leave.
[17:16:37] <meese> So I'm keeping that in mind and may look into some research that shows how long people typically wait before closing the window
[17:16:45] <duch_kazatel> a few seconds.
[17:16:55] <duch_kazatel> making them wait 4-5 before they see anything is way too long.
[17:17:58] <meese> That makes sense and is around what I would have estimated. Do you happen to have a source on that?
[17:18:07] <duch_kazatel> our analytics ;)
[17:18:36] <duch_kazatel> search around for information on pageload time and bounce rate
[17:19:51] <meese> ok, I think I might just do a fade-in 0.25s animation for loaded images
[17:19:58] <duch_kazatel> nah, don't even do that.
[17:20:02] <duch_kazatel> if you optimize them, you won't need it.
[17:20:03] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:21:00] <meese> duch_kazatel: how many KB is a JPG that you would say falls into that "you won't need it" category or sufficiently compressed images?
[17:21:16] <meese> a size ceiling in KB, if you will
[17:21:29] <duch_kazatel> that's not the whole story.
[17:21:46] <duch_kazatel> latency is a part of the story as well.
[17:21:46] <meese> What's the whole story?
[17:21:57] <duch_kazatel> location and bandwidth of the box they're being served off of, etc.
[17:22:00] <duch_kazatel> how big are these images?
[17:22:10] <duch_kazatel> and how many total?
[17:22:42] <meese> 5-6, as wide as 1800px+
[17:23:32] <meese> basically, I'll figure out what I size I'll need to do for cover images across the site
[17:23:36] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:23:38] <meese> 5-6 per page, that is.
[17:23:41] <duch_kazatel> why aren't you constraining that width?
[17:23:52] <meese> for the cover images?
[17:23:57] <duch_kazatel> your site can be a particular max with.
[17:23:59] <duch_kazatel> *width
[17:24:02] <duch_kazatel> and not go past that.
[17:24:03] <meese> it's not going to be.
[17:24:10] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[17:24:24] <meese> for an immersive experience
[17:24:26] <meese> have you seen http://meesebyte.com/demov1/
[17:24:47] <duch_kazatel> i looked at it, yeah, but i'm not sure that most people fullscreen their browsers on their desktopp like that.
[17:25:05] <meese> many will full screen
[17:25:06] <meese> many won't
[17:25:35] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[17:25:47] <duch_kazatel> then i dunno what to tell you at this point.
[17:26:20] <duch_kazatel> like, constraining  to a particular max width is not an uncommon thing, and you should be able to get the images small enough for it to not matter.
[17:26:29] <duch_kazatel> but even without the constraint, it should be fine.
[17:27:20] <duch_kazatel> i'd hit up a channel like #web for information on the specifics of optimizing that sort of stuff - there are tons of resources out there to help you learn.
[17:28:13] <meese> I'm confident in the concept of my website that I'm going with
[17:28:25] <meese> It's the execution that I'm trying to figure out.
[17:29:05] <duch_kazatel> then you'll need that .map() thing i showed you earlier and always pass an array to that function.
[17:29:09] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:29:43] <meese> thanks :)
[17:34:44] <meese> duch_kazatel: I just had an idea... I may flip the images' orientation counter-clockwise so that, if there is much visual loading of the images, it's left to right instead of top to bottom, so that they are visible even if part of the masked section is hidden, and they load in the same direction as a loading bar.
[17:35:07] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:35:10] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[17:35:42] <meese> yeah, I know I sound sort of insane...!
[17:35:50] <meese> but it's so crazy it just might be clever!
[17:35:57] <duch_kazatel> heh good luck man.
[17:36:01] <meese> thanks
[17:39:33] <arc_> o_O
[17:40:22] <meese> Don't look at me like that...! I'm...I'm...quite s-s-sane!
[17:40:29] * meese is quite sane.
[18:32:07] <bojanlazic> What
[18:32:20] <bojanlazic> What's wrong here could someone help ? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gPeZxb
[18:33:34] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[18:35:09] <duch_kazatel> tells you exactly what the problem is bojanlazic
[19:02:57] <bttf> I'm trying to handle a binary stream of a pdf file ... I know it won't work with jQuery but don't know a better place to ask ... when using XMLHttpRequest, the xhr object doesn't have a 'response' field, only 'responseText'
[19:03:19] <bttf> I'm wondering why this is - most examples say that it should be 'response' and not 'responseText'
[19:03:34] <bttf> when I manage to save the blob using responseText the pdf is malformed
[19:05:32] <duch_kazatel> i'd try ##javascript.
[19:05:58] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, sounds like a server problem?
[19:07:06] <bttf> I think the server is alright; when I try with postman, it downloads the pdf and it is in good shape
[19:09:34] <bttf> will try #js - thanks
[19:26:34] <shoky_> bttf did you change the responseType?
[19:27:03] <bttf> shoky_:  it was set to blob, and arraybuffer
[19:27:10] <bttf> I think it might be my use of pretender.js though
[19:27:29] <bttf> I'm noticing the response is wrapped in a 'FakeXMLResponse' object :\
[19:27:41] <shoky_> eek.
[19:32:01] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/YXPwbvHp
[19:32:30] <iDentity1337> First question: How can I put this into this html:   <h3 class="white" style="font-size:20px"><?php echo $twitch['channel']['status']; ?></h3><p class="btn btn-csgm btn-csgm-white">Viewers: // HERE \\></p>
[19:33:03] <duch_kazatel> that's PHP, but you'd target $('.btn-csgm').text('Viewers: ' + yourData);
[19:33:09] <iDentity1337> Second question: Why does that setInterval reload the page? Like not completly, but it runs the 'loading' animation.
[19:33:22] <duch_kazatel> becuase you're firing an ajax call.
[19:33:36] <iDentity1337> Is it possible to avoid it ?
[19:34:14] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't worry about it.
[19:34:33] <duch_kazatel> also, you can just do setInterval(twitch, 10000);
[19:34:40] <duch_kazatel> no need for the function dealip.
[19:35:05] <duch_kazatel> *dealio.  also this code assumes the request will always finish in 10 seconds.
[19:35:07] <iDentity1337> but i can't do $('.btn-csgm') since that's not the only thing
[19:35:10] <iDentity1337> on the page that uses this class
[19:35:19] <iDentity1337> can I somehow put it in a div with id #viewers?
[19:35:21] <duch_kazatel> then give it an ID or class.
[19:35:26] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[19:35:40] <duch_kazatel> then do $('#viewers').find('.btn-csgm')
[19:37:20] <iDentity1337> i think i'll just remove this loading
[19:37:21] <iDentity1337> animation
[19:37:37] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[19:37:50] <duch_kazatel> you mean you have a loading animation on the page firing?
[19:38:04] <iDentity1337> i'll send you the link on PM if that's ok
[19:38:08] <duch_kazatel> please don't :)
[19:38:14] <iDentity1337> but yeah
[19:38:18] <duch_kazatel> if you can share with me, you can put it out to the room.
[19:38:23] <iDentity1337> it's my personal ip
[19:38:24] <duch_kazatel> and that means you have a problem.
[19:38:24] <iDentity1337> :4
[19:39:23] <iDentity1337> Well, I guess AJAX doesn't work with loading animations
[19:39:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:39:35] <duch_kazatel> you can use loading animations with ajax.
[19:39:45] <shoky_> (we've already got your IP, btw)
[19:39:52] <duch_kazatel> ^ that, too.
[19:39:53] <iDentity1337> rip.
[19:40:07] <iDentity1337> rigt
[19:40:11] <iDentity1337> on connection
[19:40:36] <iDentity1337> well
[19:40:39] <iDentity1337> i guess i can share it here then
[19:40:58] <iDentity1337> http://93.180.117.159/ - I've set the interval to 10 seconds.
[19:41:06] <iDentity1337> The animation just goes ham after 10 seconds
[19:41:23] <iDentity1337> and no i didn't add the data from AJAX to viewers
[19:41:27] <iDentity1337> that's still echoing from php.
[19:42:12] <duch_kazatel> so what's the issue?
[19:42:19] <duch_kazatel> oh that animation.
[19:42:22] <iDentity1337> yeah.
[19:43:08] <duch_kazatel> \
[19:43:16] <duch_kazatel> something is causing pace.js to trigge.r
[19:43:48] <duch_kazatel> http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/ read these docs.
[19:44:13] <duch_kazatel> you need to tell the library to NOT fire on every ajax call.
[19:46:17] <iDentity1337> yeah it's in paceOptions i think
[19:59:53] <iDentity1337> well i'll figure out the rest tomorrow
[19:59:57] <iDentity1337> thanks duch_kazatel
[20:00:00] <iDentity1337> :)
[20:00:03] <iDentity1337> good night.
[20:31:58] <Anthaas__> Hi guys - a complete noob here. If at the top of a script I put: alert("Done!"); I get an alert on the page, but when I put it inside $('#myThing').submit(function(){ alert("Done!"); }); I dont get anything
[20:48:13] <shoky> Anthaas__:  what is #myThing ?
[20:48:37] <shoky> and why are you expecting that handler to be called
[20:49:55] <Anthaas__> shoky, #myThing is a <button type="submit ...>
[20:50:02] <Anthaas__> And I am clicking the button on the page.
[20:51:01] <Anthaas__> I have also tried: $("#myThing").submit(function(event){
[20:51:01] <Anthaas__>  event.preventDefault();
[20:51:01] <Anthaas__>  alert("Done!");
[20:51:01] <Anthaas__> });
[20:51:03] <shoky> Anthaas__:  buttons don't get a submit event, only <form>'s
[20:51:11] <Anthaas__> Ahh.
[20:51:26] <Anthaas__> Its part of a form.
[20:51:32] <Anthaas__> Signing in form to be specific.
[20:51:34] <shoky> so?
[20:51:51] <Anthaas__> context
[20:52:02] <shoky> kk
[20:52:32] <shoky> Anthaas__: btw don't use alerts, use console.log
[20:52:37] <shoky> and look at your devtools console
[20:52:43] <Anthaas__> Ahh ok
[20:53:04] <Anthaas__> shoky https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d24f948f05f62d1b16c9
[20:53:22] <shoky> Anthaas__: ok, but why are you showing me this?
[20:53:29] <Anthaas__> #myThing in this case is login-form-submit.
[20:53:49] <Anthaas__> Should it be #login-form
[20:53:59] <Anthaas__> (doesnt work either, so evidently not :/)
[20:54:11] <shoky> there's not even a #myThing in that gist
[20:54:19] <Anthaas__> No, I changed it in here for brevity.
[20:54:29] <Anthaas__> (People often dont care about details)
[20:55:35] <shoky> ok, so yes it should be #login-form because that is the <form> , which is the element that gets the submit event
[20:55:44] <Anthaas__> Doesnt work :/
[20:55:51] <shoky> make a jsfiddle showing it not working
[20:56:06] <shoky> or put your code in the gist too
[20:56:23] <shoky> "doesnt work" is useless
[20:58:27] <shoky> Anthaas__: also make sure the form is already in the DOM at the time youre doing this. e.g. include your <script> at the end of <body>
[20:58:33] <shoky> or use $(document).ready
[20:58:49] <Anthaas__> Using codepen.io, it works.
[20:58:52] <shoky> assuming it's in the initial html
[20:59:46] <Anthaas__> Ahhh, adding the <script> at the end of the page makes it work.
[21:00:20] <shoky> groovy
[21:01:15] <Anthaas__> thanks!
[21:49:10] <Bud> What did you use jQuery for today?
[23:16:30] <esstter> hi
[23:17:18] <esstter> i put a small function, but it fires immediately https://jsfiddle.net/Lcv8rzj3/
[23:17:42] <esstter> there is another click bind to the div, could that be the reason?
[23:29:55] <hydraidm801> I am trying to get the value of the input before it is submited how do I do it https://jsfiddle.net/8hz5ft9n/
[23:30:58] <hydraidm801> https://jsfiddle.net/8hz5ft9n/1/
[23:34:59] <hydraidm801> https://jsfiddle.net/8hz5ft9n/3/
[23:36:34] <esstter> isnt there an onDataEntry or something like that
[23:47:44] <hydraidm801> I found the value in normal JS it is this.children.zipsearch.value
[23:47:59] <hydraidm801> Not sure how to do that in jQuery though
[23:54:38] <esstter> .change()
[23:54:42] <esstter> is what you'r elooking for i believe
