[00:01:48] <shoky> np
[00:02:10] <shoky> what do you mean that the events are synchronous?  (i donno socket.io)
[00:07:48] <shellox__> hi
[00:08:17] <shellox__> how can i select the td's in a tr with jquery?
[00:08:19] <te-brian> shoky, synchronous was the wrong word .. linear maybe better
[00:08:29] <shellox__> $('.edit_tr').live('click', function() {   console.log($(this).closest('tr'));  });
[00:08:32] <shellox__> i got this
[00:08:39] <te-brian> shoky, connecting -> connected -> disconnected -> reconnecting -> reconnected
[00:08:42] <shellox__> but how to get the td?
[00:09:09] <shoky> shellox__ which td?
[00:09:30] <shoky> and i'm assuming .edit_tr is a <tr> ?
[00:09:45] <shellox__> shoky: it looks like <tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
[00:09:51] <shellox__> shoky: yep
[00:10:00] <thirdender> anyone around use Flux Slider?
[00:10:03] <shoky> then, what td?
[00:10:03] <shellox__> there is a table row with an edit link
[00:10:10] <shellox__> shoky: all
[00:10:17] <shoky> $(this).find('td')
[00:10:31] <shoky> or $(this).children()
[00:11:07] <shoky> also better to use .on than .live:  $(document).on('click', '.edit_tr', function...)
[00:11:36] <shoky> and better to use some more specific container than document
[00:11:42] <shoky> a static one
[00:12:04] <shoky> but that's an aside
[00:15:05] <shellox__> shoky: thanks
[00:20:10] <mink> Hello. Maybe any one know how i can fix this problem ->  http://jsfiddle.net/heyde/
[00:20:37] <mink> When input type is hidden, jquery change value of that in JS, but not 'put' this to dom element.
[00:21:07] <shellox__> shoky: one last question; how can i get the text of the single tlds in an array back? I use $(this).closest('tr').find("td").text();
[00:21:11] <shellox__> but this returns a string
[00:21:14] <varnie> Hello
[00:21:30] <varnie> what is the proper way of checking whether the object is in array?
[00:22:30] <shellox__> ah have another idea
[00:41:08] <RonWhoCares> shoky: You still here?
[00:42:28] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I am wondering how you correctly update the <option></option> list of a <select>
[00:42:44] <RonWhoCares> - do I use val ? or html?
[00:46:04] <vl1234> hi hi am come back with small doubt
[00:47:40] <vl1234> i have a                 var a = "abc" ;  how to add _1 in end of abc.............the result should be "abc_1"
[00:47:53] <vl1234> any idea
[00:48:21] <vl1234> its simple but am not get a solution
[00:50:50] <coldhead> ?eval a = 'abc'; b = 'abc' + '_1'; b;
[00:50:53] <bot-t> coldhead: "abc_1"
[00:51:14] <coldhead> ?eval a = 'abc'; b = a + '_1'; b; // even
[00:51:15] <bot-t> coldhead: "abc_1"
[00:51:23] <coldhead> bot-t: thank you
[00:51:23] * bot-t sighs
[00:53:24] <vl1234> @coldhead........................ eval  is a 1 function
[00:54:04] <coldhead> don't use eval
[00:54:15] <coldhead> i was just asking bot-t to eval to show you how it works
[00:54:27] <coldhead> you just want b = a + '_1';
[00:54:46] <vl1234> am tried but not getting
[00:55:00] <coldhead> sweet zombie jesus
[00:55:46] <coldhead> vl1234: http://jsfiddle.net/rVZ4a/
[00:55:46] <vl1234> @coldhead........................got it
[00:55:50] <coldhead> oh good
[00:55:52] <coldhead> case closed
[00:56:13] <vl1234> @coldhead........................hahahahahahah..........simple but ???????
[00:58:32] <coldhead> simple but case closed
[00:59:20] <shoky> RonWhoCares: you can detach/remove <option> elements, and add new ones in e.g. $('#theSelect').append( someOption )
[00:59:59] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Is this correct then:   $("#create_month").append("Bible_word_search_generator_update_by_month_select_options.php");
[01:00:20] <RonWhoCares> Shoky the previous line is:     $("#create_month").remove();
[01:00:21] <shoky> uh
[01:00:36] <shoky> dont think so
[01:00:42] <RonWhoCares> What changes need to make?
[01:01:08] <shoky> why $('#create_month').remove() ?
[01:01:34] <RonWhoCares> shoky: That is the empty the current list of <option> 's
[01:01:46] <RonWhoCares> is that much correct?
[01:01:49] <shoky> $('#create_month').empty()
[01:01:53] <shoky> if you wanna remove all options
[01:01:58] <RonWhoCares> ok
[01:02:07] <shoky> and, what options do you want to add?
[01:02:24] <RonWhoCares> the results of Bible_word_search_generator_update_by_month_select_options.php
[01:02:24] <shoky> "Bible_word_search_generator_update_by_month_select_options.php"  is just text
[01:02:29] <shoky> huh
[01:02:34] <shoky> oh
[01:02:39] <shoky> data, you mean?
[01:02:41] <coldhead> so biblical
[01:02:41] <shoky> in the callback?
[01:03:16] <RonWhoCares> yes
[01:03:35] <shoky> it's in the form "<option...>...</option>" ?
[01:03:47] <RonWhoCares> correct
[01:04:00] <shoky> $('#create_month').append(data)
[01:04:03] <shoky> ?
[01:04:34] <guy> What's the easiest way to apply CSS if I have it in a string?
[01:04:36] <guy> like background-image: url('http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg'); width: 520px; height: 2473px;
[01:04:53] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Where do I put the PHP file name
[01:05:12] <shoky> RonWhoCares: in your $.ajax/$.post url ..
[01:06:23] <xec> guy: set it as the style attribute?
[01:06:58] <xec> guy: or, append it to, if you expect there might be some styles there already
[01:07:03] <guy> Can't think of why not.
[01:07:31] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Ok, 1 minute
[01:07:37] <phr> hey guys. how can i scroll to an anchor or an id, after the load(); ?
[01:07:56] <RonWhoCares> $.post("Bible_word_search_generator_update_by_month_select_options.php",function(data) { $("#create_month").html(data); });
[01:07:59] <RonWhoCares> like this then?
[01:07:59] <phr> without clicking any link
[01:08:40] <sente> phr: well, one way would be:
[01:08:49] <sente> phr: window.location="http://docs.python.org/library/queue.html#Queue.Queue.join"
[01:08:50] <shoky> RonWhoCares: seems ok
[01:08:54] <sente> that's probably not the "best" way
[01:08:55] <RonWhoCares> ok
[01:09:13] <sente> but that will scroll to the #Queue.Queue.join id when already on the page
[01:09:31] <phr> hmm
[01:09:40] <phr> i was thinkin about using the scroll and fade function
[01:10:19] <xec> phr: maybe you're looking for this? http://balupton.github.com/jquery-scrollto/demo/
[01:11:02] <RonWhoCares> Great
[01:11:05] <RonWhoCares> Thank you for your help
[01:11:05] <phr> xec exactly, but i'd like it automatically
[01:11:23] <phr> xec i want to go the the id/anchor after load() is finished
[01:11:26] <xec> phr: just slap a call in your load event?
[01:11:31] <guy> ok. What if I need to extract only background URL from this?
[01:11:31] <guy> background-image: url('http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg'); width: 520px; height: 2473px;
[01:11:40] <guy> Do I need to use regex?
[01:11:41] <phr> xec i like to slap, but im too noob in jquery :|
[01:12:11] <phr> oh i see. thanks xec.
[01:13:00] <guy> console.log( $('<div />').attr('style', $(this).attr('style')).css('backgroundImage') );
[01:13:11] <guy> The problem with this approach is that it will load images
[01:13:19] <guy> Which is something I don't want.
[01:13:58] <Cork> Guest24011: regex match?
[01:13:58] * shoky deja-vu
[01:14:02] <Cork> opps
[01:14:05] <Cork> *guy:
[01:14:55] <Cork> ?eval "background-image: url('http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg'); width: 520px; height: 2473px;".match(/url\('([^']+)'\)/)
[01:14:56] <bot-t> Cork: ["url('http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg')", "http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg"]
[01:15:05] <Cork> ?eval "background-image: url('http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg'); width: 520px; height: 2473px;".match(/url\('([^']+)'\)/)[1]
[01:15:06] <bot-t> Cork: "http://anuary.com/public/uploads/tabasco-20111015.jpg"
[01:15:46] <guy> https://gist.github.com/41595842eb5cf801777b
[01:15:50] <guy> Actually this did work.
[01:16:08] <guy> without loading pictures afaik.
[01:16:08] <Cork> that will load the image though
[01:16:19] <guy> Doesn't seem to on Chrome.
[01:16:26] <Cork> or rather it depends on the browser
[01:16:34] <Cork> your parsing it to dom
[01:16:48] <Cork> and that will trigger loads of stuff, and its much slower then needed
[01:17:07] <Cork> wait a min
[01:17:22] <Cork> your doing it on $(this).attr('style') so its already in the dom
[01:17:33] <Cork> why are you adding it to a temp div??
[01:19:06] <guy> because the CSS rule is overwritten background: none
[01:19:30] <guy> Cork: therefore I am reading attr('style'), not css()
[01:19:47] <Cork> ya, but your doing that after
[01:19:58] <Cork> why not just read it first?
[01:20:13] <guy> Meaning what?
[01:21:00] <Cork> $(this).data('picture_css_url', $(this).css('background-image')).css('background-image', 'none');
[01:22:05] <guy> Cork: no, you don't get it. There is CSS rule .gallery > .picture { background: none; }; Thus $(this).css('background-image') will return none;
[01:22:40] <Cork> guy: you mean the picture class has !important?
[01:22:43] <xec> guy: maybe try explaining from scratch what you're really trying to do
[01:22:47] <guy> Cork: Ya.
[01:22:50] <Cork> OUCH
[01:23:01] <Cork> well bad design... results in horrible code
[01:23:16] <guy> Cork: It is intended to prevent loading all images on the page.
[01:23:30] <guy> I want them displayed only when scrolled to a certain point.
[01:24:02] <Cork> i would either do away with the !important flag
[01:24:05] <Cork> or use regex
[01:24:15] <Cork> your waisting a LOT of cpu power there, for no reason
[01:24:28] <guy> even with regex?
[01:25:42] <Cork> no regex is much better then what you had
[01:25:53] <Cork> though i would still recomend to fix the !important instead
[01:30:55] <pandu101> hey all. can the callback function in ajax return values? For ex: fnA calls fnB. fnB has an ajax request in it. Can fnB return the ajax response to fnA? I've tried to do it and it does not work. But maybe there is some jquery magic that allows this?
[01:34:39] <Cork> pandu101: no, the code in fnA has ended before the fnB is called
[01:34:54] <Cork> so it can't return anything there cause theres nothing there to react to it
[01:36:05] <pandu101> Cork: ok. thanks.
[01:36:24] <negev> hi, can anyone tell me why this doesn't work?  http://5.9.12.83/jquery/   i'm trying to use $.extend() to extend a jquery dom object class with an extra method.
[01:36:44] <negev> prolly better to look at view-source:http://5.9.12.83/jquery/
[01:37:04] <Cork> negev: your script tags are in the wrong place
[01:37:14] <Cork> they should either be in the body or in the header
[01:37:17] <negev> yeah i know, its just an example
[01:37:40] <Cork> uh....
[01:37:43] <negev> which is also why its 33 lines and missing anything that would make it useful
[01:37:54] <Cork> your extending the return value from a function, but you never stores it
[01:38:10] <negev> ahhh taht makes sense
[01:38:11] <negev> thanks
[01:38:12] <pandu101> Right now. This is how my code is working fnA calls fnB. fnB makes an ajax request. The ajax response is then directly attached to the DOM. So fnA -> fnB -> Ajax -> HTML. Instead of this I cant do fnA -> fnB -> Ajax ->(return data)-> fnA
[01:38:12] <Cork> so ya, thats understandable
[01:38:28] <Cork> negev: try extending $this
[01:39:08] <negev> if i put the extend call before the $this assignment it still fails
[01:39:31] <negev> what you said doesn't work either
[01:41:11] <Cork> negev: do it on the $this variable
[01:41:15] <negev> i did
[01:41:16] <Cork> not the $(this) function call
[01:41:28] <negev> view-source:http://5.9.12.83/jquery/
[01:41:53] <Cork> $('#submit') <--
[01:41:58] <Cork> thats a new function call
[01:42:04] <Cork> you need to use the variable you extended
[01:42:10] <Cork> or you need to extend the prototype
[01:42:21] <Cork> $.fn.extend(GiiClass);
[01:42:32] <pandu101> Hi Cork: if this works: fnA -> fnB -> Ajax -> HTML. Then why cant the foll work? fnA -> fnB -> Ajax -> fnA. Does that make sense?
[01:42:50] <negev> ahh thanks
[01:43:33] <Cork> pandu101: cause the flow is fnA calls > fnB > fnB calls > AJAX > fnB ends > fnA ends > ajax success callback triggers
[01:44:03] <pandu101> ohhhhh.....
[01:44:11] <Cork> pandu101: ajax is async
[01:44:22] <Cork> so all the calling functions end before its callbacks are triggered
[01:44:32] <pandu101> aaahhhhh....
[01:44:39] <Cork> they are never triggered before, no matter how fast your connection responds
[01:45:01] <pandu101> finally get that async part :)
[01:45:25] <negev> still no joy Cork :( view-source:http://5.9.12.83/jquery/
[01:45:26] <pandu101> Cork: Thanks! Makes lot of sense
[01:45:35] <guy> Will elements with visibility: hidden; display: none; be loaded?
[01:45:51] <guy> uhm. element background pictures
[01:46:25] <Cork> pandu101: uh... wait your calling extraMethod, but not with a selector
[01:46:33] <Cork> oook, backup
[01:46:38] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[01:48:11] <pandu101> Cork: Kinda hard to explain. But here goes. My form does whois look and tells if domain is avail. So my funcA is triggered onload. Then it calls funcB (which is just an ajax check on the whois api).
[01:48:37] <pandu101> the ajax gets the result and displays on the form directly.
[01:48:41] <Cork> opps sorry wrong nick
[01:48:53] <Cork> pandu101: your i know what happens (sorry)
[01:48:59] <pandu101> ohh.. ok...
[01:49:09] <Cork> negev: that was meant for you => "uh... wait your calling extraMethod, but not with a selector"
[01:49:12] <negev> oops sorry im a moron
[01:49:12] <pandu101> was feeling excited for a second. No worries.. :)
[01:49:27] <negev> thanks Cork :)
[01:49:29] <negev> works now
[01:49:51] <Cork> negev: the class should just be converted to an object
[01:50:10] <Cork> var obj ={ }; obj.methods = function() {};
[01:50:17] <Cork> no need for the extra function there
[01:50:28] <Cork> it won't do anything in the prototype anyway
[01:50:58] <Whirl3d> How does one apply the rotateX css transform to an element using jquery?
[01:51:45] <Cork> you would have to reset all the values on transform
[01:52:54] <Cork> so css('transform', '<other transformers>rotate(20deb)');
[01:52:59] <pandu101> Cork: Is it possible to define the ajax callback function outside of the ajax request and then just call it within the ajx request?
[01:53:08] <Cork> yes
[01:53:26] <Cork> $.ajax({ success: my_function_callback
[01:53:31] <pandu101> Great! thanks!
[01:53:35] <Cork> pandu101: or you can return the xhr it creates
[01:53:42] <Cork> i personally like that solution better
[01:54:02] <pandu101> Cork: I thot xhr has only error info. I dont quite follow you.
[01:54:03] <Cork> function create() { return $.ajax(...); }; create().success(function(data) {});
[01:54:18] <pandu101> Yes, tahts the format Im using right now.
[01:54:30] <Cork> function create() { return $.ajax(...); }; create().success(function(data) {}).error().complete;
[01:54:36] <Cork> so that should work just fine
[01:55:11] <pandu101> sorry, i misread the first time. Which is the xhr format?
[01:55:28] <Cork> $.ajax returns an jqXHR object
[01:55:35] <Cork> its a deferred obeject
[01:55:39] <Cork> ?.deferred
[01:55:41] <bot-t> Cork, Deferred Object - jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state o... http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[01:56:14] <Cork> pandu101: so it lets you define error, success and complete through dacy-chaining functions
[01:57:03] <pandu101> So what does that have to do with defining the callback function outside of the ajax request? Appreciate the info tho.
[01:57:18] <Cork> if you return the value $.ajax returns
[01:57:27] <Cork> you can define the callbacks through those functions
[01:57:48] <Cork> $.ajax().success(function(data) {}); === $.ajax({ success: function(data) {} });
[01:58:10] <Cork> and if your function returns the value from $.ajax like create did up there
[01:58:34] <Cork> create().success(function() {}); === $.ajax({ success: function(data) {} });
[01:59:12] <Cork> additionally you can bind multible callback listners without getting conflicts
[01:59:43] <Cork> function do() { return create().success(function()..); }; do().success(function()..);
[01:59:56] <pandu101> Hmmm.... Im going to google some examples. I think this might cut down on the amount of code I have to duplicate.
[02:00:25] <pandu101> Cork: Thanks dude!
[02:00:28] <Cork> np
[02:00:47] <Cork> just remember to make sure you don't try to return things through callbacks cause that won't work :)
[02:02:43] <pandu101> Cork: Thanks to the flow you showed earlier, I finally get it why returning things thru callbacks dont work. I went to the JS room and asked those guys as well. :)
[02:08:37] <guy> I was pretty sure that data-foo="" accepts JSON
[02:08:38] <guy> no?
[02:09:06] <wathek> what wysiwyg do you use for an just one line text editing ?
[02:09:47] <Cork> no
[02:10:04] <Cork> guy: you need to string escape it if you put it in the attribute
[02:10:08] <Cork> .data accepts json though
[02:10:28] <Cork> guy: sorry not string escape, entity encode it
[02:10:51] <Cork> guy: http://htmlentities.net/
[02:11:06] <guy> Got it.
[02:11:35] <shankey> hey every one
[02:11:48] <shankey> is there any way that i can scann a paper document through scanner from browser using jquery, html5, css, javascript
[02:11:52] <shankey> jquery
[02:12:08] <Cork> wathek: ckeditor is fairly nice i think
[02:12:23] <Cork> shankey: no
[02:12:45] <Cork> you would need to have scaner drivers and something that handles the image generation from it
[02:12:46] <wathek> Cork, ok thank you
[02:13:05] <bjensen12> when I do console.log(foo) and it outputs Object { deselected="workshop_131"} how can I find out which methods it supports?
[02:13:16] <Cork> shankey: public code doesn't have that deep access to your hardware
[02:13:34] <Cork> bjensen12: it should be in there too
[02:13:47] <Cork> bjensen12: alternatively try console.log(foo.prototype);
[02:13:52] <bjensen12> ahh thanks cork
[02:14:28] <bjensen12> foo.prototype returns undefined
[02:14:56] <Cork> ok, then it doesn't have any functions
[02:14:59] <PeterB> Hi, I need to remove all items from an object where the value is null or undefined.
[02:15:02] <negev> can i extend $.fn so that a method is called automatically when i instantiate an object using a selector?
[02:15:16] <PeterB> If it was an array I could use .filter(), but for an object I can't find a method. Can anyone help?
[02:15:25] <Cork> ?eval var a = { f: function() { alert('hi!'); } }; console.log(a)
[02:15:25] <bot-t> Cork: {"f": <function () {alert("hi!");}>}
[02:15:58] <bjensen12> cork: I can call foo.deselected on it..
[02:16:14] <Cork> bjensen12: what browser is this in?
[02:16:24] <Cork> might be it doesn't show functions
[02:16:40] <bjensen12> firefox
[02:16:48] <Cork> firefox or firebug?
[02:16:49] <bjensen12> newest version of both firefox and firebug
[02:16:52] <Cork> ok
[02:16:57] <Cork> firebug i know show the functions
[02:17:07] <bjensen12> (just reinstalled everything yesterday)
[02:17:15] <Cork> just inspect the object and you should get a full list
[02:18:07] <Cork> PeterB: you mean a plain object { somekey:value } ?
[02:18:20] <bjensen12> cork: its like a its a hash { selected : "workshop_22"}
[02:18:54] <Cork> bjensen12: javascript doesn't have hash its either an array or an object
[02:19:03] <bjensen12> Cork:
[02:19:04] <Cork> or actually everything is an object
[02:19:12] <guy> Well, what do you guys think?
[02:19:12] <guy> http://anuary.com/1/home/anuary
[02:19:14] <Cork> bjensen12: anyway do you have a link?
[02:19:17] <bjensen12> Cork: right. Thats why I said its like a hash, not a hash :)
[02:19:24] <guy> Still not Google friendly, though.
[02:19:24] <ravenzz> PeterB you can filter objects with the jQuery filter()
[02:19:25] <Cork> bjensen12: k
[02:19:32] <PeterB> Cork: yes, like http://pastebin.com/p16Jr6WG
[02:19:45] <ravenzz> otherwise loop the object with a for or whatever
[02:19:51] <Cork> ?jquery.grep @ PeterB
[02:19:51] <bot-t> PeterB, jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[02:20:04] <PeterB> ravenzz, Cork: What I'm trying to do is encode all set object properties in a URL
[02:20:12] <negev> ok a slightly revised question, is there any way to inject code into the initialisation of a dom object when using a selector?
[02:20:16] <PeterB> and I do'n't want the foo=undefined&bar=null ones
[02:20:19] <Cork> PeterB: filter only works on jquery selectors, not objects
[02:20:47] <Cork> PeterB: $.params(obj) should remove null objects by default
[02:21:25] <Cork> sorry param
[02:21:36] <Cork> and hmm, apparently it doens't >_>
[02:22:03] <PeterB> not in my testing at least :
[02:22:04] <PeterB> :(
[02:22:43] <negev> apparently extending init() causes the selectors to break lol
[02:22:51] <tw2113> ?eval 173 * 5
[02:22:51] <bot-t> tw2113: 865
[02:23:09] <tw2113> good bot-t *pets*
[02:23:12] <negev> i guess there's no super in javascript
[02:23:29] <bjensen12> cork: the object is basically this: var f = {"my_cool_method" : "foo"}. The problem is that the cool method can be named multiple things. Thus I would like to be able to get the name of it
[02:24:34] <rue> negev: No, though you can fake it. And I think CS handles that too
[02:25:02] <negev> fake it how?  essentially i want to add additional code into the init() method of $.fn without breaking what it already does
[02:25:11] <negev> ideally after all the native init stuff has happened
[02:25:18] <Whirl3d> superscript or math function?
[02:25:20] <negev> would be nice if there were hooks fo rthis
[02:25:33] <Cork> bjensen12: you can try Object.keys(obj); though i don't think thats cross browser
[02:25:53] <bjensen12> Cork:
[02:26:04] <bjensen12> Cork: that works..ok Ill go test with the browsers
[02:26:15] <Cork> ?mdc object.keys
[02:26:16] <bot-t> Cork, keys - MDN - Returns an array of all own enumerable properties found upon a given object, in the same order as that provided by a for-in loop (the difference being that a for-in loop enumerates properties in th... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[02:26:41] <Cork> ie9 is prob the biggest obstetrical
[02:26:55] <Cork> ff4 and chrome5 is cool
[02:27:07] <Cork> opera... who cares >_> *wissel*
[02:27:36] <ravenzz> PeterB do you want to filter the object or produce a query string without the null/undefined values?
[02:27:37] <rue> negev: You’d make a function that calls the original function
[02:27:37] <negev> does javascript support getters in the sense of writing a getFoo() method and then using obj.foo as a property?
[02:27:57] <PeterB> ravenzz: a query string without the null/undefined values
[02:28:10] <Cork> negev: yes, but its fairly new
[02:28:17] <Cork> its getters and setters
[02:28:21] <Cork> ?mdc getters
[02:28:25] <bot-t> Cork, Defining Getters and Setters - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Defining_Getters_and_Setters
[02:28:25] <negev> neat
[02:28:31] <Cork> so no ie support
[02:28:42] <negev> hah as if anyone still uses ie
[02:29:00] <Cork> way too many
[02:29:02] <rue> negev: I’m a little hazy on the details. But it’d be better to just use CS and have it handle all those details for you.
[02:29:53] <ravenzz> PeterB http://jsfiddle.net/Jg9Sd/
[02:29:58] <negev> what's CS?
[02:30:29] <rue> CoffeeScript, it’s a Ruby/Python-like language that is compiled to JavaScript
[02:30:35] <ravenzz> PeterB well probably it would be better to join by & and the encode anything later
[02:31:04] <ravenzz> then*
[02:32:45] <bjensen12> so when I get the method by doing for example var method = Object.keys(foo)[0], how do I invoke the method on foo? I would assume it would be foo.call(method), but I get a call is not a function error..
[02:33:00] <rue> negev: http://coffeescript.org — JS is a wonderful language in that you can use the functional thing to actually get very close to classic OO…it’s just that it’s rather cumbersome. Hence, CS.
[02:33:20] <Cork> bjensen12: foo[objname]()
[02:33:30] <bjensen12> ah thanks
[02:34:01] <Cork> rue: not everyone want or can depend on a pre processor
[02:34:02] <negev> im struggling to see how this getters thing works when you're extending an object
[02:34:12] <negev> get something: function()
[02:34:13] <negev> errors
[02:35:23] <Cork> ?eval var obj = { a: 10 }; obj.__defineGetter__("b", function() { return this.a * 2; }); obj.b
[02:35:25] <bot-t> Cork: 20
[02:36:39] <negev> yeah i saw that, but how do you do it in the context of extending?  obj.extend({ <newline> __defineGetter__   etc doesn't work
[02:37:46] <rue> Cork: Sure, but it’s the better solution for 80% of cases
[02:40:23] <Cork> rue: i don't agree at all
[02:40:42] <Cork> i think cs is a bad idea unless you for some reason REALLY need it
[02:40:50] <Cork> your painting your self into a corner
[02:40:57] <negev> Cork is it possible to do the same thing in the context of extending?
[02:41:24] <Cork> negev: extending just sets the values from object 1 on object2
[02:41:30] <Cork> so just set it manually afterwards
[02:42:09] <negev> ok, im trying this now: $.fn.__defineGetter__('element',function() {
[02:42:12] <negev> doesn't seem to work
[02:42:21] <negev> this.element is undefined after using the selector
[02:42:26] <Cork> element isn't an object on prototype
[02:42:29] <Cork> its on the object
[02:42:41] <Cork> uh.. that became strange
[02:43:05] <Cork> element is part of the generated object, not its generic prototype
[02:43:30] <Cork> (the jquery object)
[02:47:06] <negev> so basically i can't do what i wanted to do
[02:47:41] <Cork> what is it you want to do actually?
[02:47:55] <Cork> get your function called each time someone selects something on the page?
[02:50:39] <Cork> negev: (function() { var org_init = $.fn.init; $.fn.init = function() { var response = org_init.apply(this, arguments); /* do your think */ return response; }); })();
[02:50:51] <Cork> s/think/thing/
[02:51:42] <Cork> should prob do that on jQuery instead of $ just to be safe
[02:57:19] <GhostBear> Hello. I have <input> and two <a> links which set predefined values to <input> but when you stop editing input and click somewhere else it supposed to remove input, a's and replace it with text value. What is the best way to implement this? I've tried to use onblur on <input> but it removes <a>'s before their onclick events are fired.
[02:57:35] <GhostBear> Any ideas\suggestions?
[02:59:01] <Cork> GhostBear: only way would be to store that the blur has happend on that element in a global variable and bind a global click event that does the action if that variable is set
[02:59:12] <Cork> GhostBear: and yes blur happens before click
[02:59:22] <Cork> blur > focus > click
[02:59:24] <KingDosser> Can someone please link me to a decent tutorial on using dragging and dropping. I'm having trouble with mine not working
[03:00:31] <GhostBear> Cork, don't you think that global click will fire earlier than <a> click?
[03:00:43] <Cork> nope
[03:00:52] <Cork> it will trigger after that click handler
[03:01:04] <GhostBear> Thanks, i'll try this method then
[03:02:40] <GhostBear> I've tried to read and understand Deffered object, do you think it can be useful for me problem?
[03:23:06] <ullmark> Hello, Anyone have had problems with animations an IE :) Sometimes, it stops in the middle of the animation... (IE9)..
[03:23:12] <ullmark> and*
[04:22:44] <diverdude> Is it possible to act on an event listetning to if an element is visible or not?
[04:23:12] <sente> is it possible to parse that sentence?
[04:23:37] <diverdude> sente: me?
[04:24:22] <sente> yeah, though my lack of sleep ain't helping
[04:25:22] <diverdude> sente: its a pretty simple question
[04:25:29] <diverdude> i dont know if there is a simple solution though
[04:29:41] <kelye> anyone worked with uploadify/swfupload ? how do i get the full server response in case of an error ?
[04:30:35] <diverdude> kelye: use plupload
[04:31:10] <nFFF> Im getting a parse error
[04:38:25] <kelye> diverdude: thanks, looks ok
[04:38:29] <kelye> i will give it a try
[04:38:36] <diverdude> kelye: yw :)
[04:47:40] <Sadale> Why jQury instead of standard Javascript?
[04:47:46] <Sadale> *jQuery
[04:53:43] <diverdude> is it possible to load dependency libs via jquery?
[04:55:34] <pachet> can you qualify that a little more
[04:57:11] <diverdude> pachet: basically i just want to load a .js script from jquery
[04:58:04] <pachet> ? $.getScript() @ diverdude
[04:58:06] <bot-t> diverdude, jQuery.getScript() - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[04:58:57] <diverdude> wonderful :)
[05:00:09] <Whirl3d_> I have a script that cycles through an array of object literals, pulling out a "lookup" value and then trying to find that value in my text and it's only working some of the time. Here is the fiddle (just scroll past all the data-it's really short and the data will be retrieved from mysql in json format.) http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/558uh/7/
[05:07:53] <Whirl3d_> didn't mean to scare everyone off. 8)
[05:08:13] <diverdude> pachet: hmmm it seems that $.getScript is non blocking. is that correct?
[05:08:23] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, define some of the time
[05:08:27] <nFFF> what cases does it not work for
[05:08:46] <Whirl3d_> I can't seem to find a reason or a rule as to when it does or doesnt
[05:08:47] <pachet> diverdude: all $ ajax methods are non-blocking by default
[05:09:00] <diverdude> pachet: is it possible to make it blocking?
[05:09:06] <Whirl3d_> I log the matches/misses and though they are always the same, I can't see a pattern
[05:09:13] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, you have a redundant regex defined is the only thing I get at a first glance
[05:09:20] <nFFF> You can also use $.each to iterate over the object
[05:09:35] <nFFF> but I guess it would be slower
[05:10:06] <nFFF> on that fiddle though, can you give an example of where its failed
[05:10:08] <nFFF> so I can see
[05:10:15] <jsnoob> hey guys, how do I install jquery on osx
[05:10:21] <aaronmcadam> diverdude: if you need that sort of thing, use require or yepnope or something
[05:10:42] <aaronmcadam> jsnoob: jquery is not an app
[05:10:44] <Whirl3d_> wherever you see "unable to find" it's a failure. Now some of those are spelling errors in the source, but some just plain aren't
[05:10:49] <diverdude> aaronmcadam: require? is that a lib or a function?
[05:10:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah require.js
[05:11:12] <aaronmcadam> don't try to use ajax in a synchronous way
[05:12:10] <pachet> that'd be sjax
[05:12:11] <pachet> s for shit
[05:12:14] <jsnoob> aaronmcadam: i found a .exe for it but that won't run on osx
[05:12:16] <Whirl3d_> Like "African Paradise-flycatcher" should show up more than once and it says it can't find it.
[05:12:23] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[05:12:26] <aaronmcadam> you must be trolling
[05:13:29] <jsnoob> im trying to code gta v in javascript
[05:13:41] <jsnoob> someone in #javascript said there is a jquery plugin for it
[05:13:56] <Demonen> $.gtav()
[05:13:58] <Demonen> It's built in
[05:14:05] <MiracleBlue> Nono
[05:14:17] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/558uh/9/     nfff, you can see that it says, "can't find african....." but then I log the index ofit and it's there.
[05:14:24] <MiracleBlue> $.gta("version", "v");
[05:14:24] <jsnoob> where do I run that? in osx terminal?
[05:14:47] <jsnoob> i haven't install jquery yet though so i dont' thinkt it will work
[05:14:47] <Demonen> MiracleBlue: Yeah, $.gtav() is just a front for that, obviously.
[05:15:02] <MiracleBlue> Ah true Demonen ;)
[05:18:17] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!"idiot"

[05:22:25] <Whirl3d_> I hear sarcasm makes you look fat, is that true?
[05:22:27] <diverdude> kelye: i also really like that that plugin :)
[05:23:00] <Demonen> Whirl3d_: Sorry to break it to you, but it's not the sarcasm...
[05:23:26] <diverdude> Whirl3d_: im moderately sarcastic and moderately fat :)
[05:23:31] * Whirl3d_ leans forward to hear the punchline...
[05:24:01] <Whirl3d_> right on diverdude! Own it! Make it yours!
[05:24:11] <Whirl3d_> Me too, I suppose.
[05:24:31] <diverdude> own my fatness? I already do :/
[05:24:38] <Demonen> No, pretty please, with sugar on top, can we get back to the jQuery?
[05:24:51] <diverdude> Whirl3d_: you can have it though if you want it :D
[05:25:07] <Whirl3d_> I'm waiting for someone to answer my question. Demonen, so sure...
[05:25:55] <Demonen> Whirl3d_: I joined after you asked it, I think.
[05:26:01] <Demonen> What was it?
[05:26:12] <Whirl3d_> Demonen, you want help with  your issue, go to jsfiddle.net, post your HTML, CSS, and JS and I'll be glad to help you. Otherwise it's a stab in the dark
[05:26:51] <Demonen> Whirl3d_: I posted a pastebin link with the relevant snippet and the URL of the live page.  You still want it on fiddle?
[05:27:08] <Whirl3d_> We at least need to see your html. And not to pick it out of your site.. something like 80 % (I'm guessing) of people's mistakes are found when they fiddle it.
[05:27:22] <Whirl3d_> lol I totally made up the statistic, but you get my point
[05:27:43] <Demonen> Yeah, something like 74% of all statistics like that are made up on the spot ;-)
[05:27:52] <Demonen> Yeah, I'll do the fiddle and try again :)
[05:27:56] <Whirl3d_> It's having the three pieces together that makes it easier to troubleshoot. Pastebin, pasties, etc. are all so 2d.
[05:28:14] <Demonen> Hence the live site, but point taken.
[05:28:22] <Whirl3d_> and you might want to stay away from naming your class: .hasChildren
[05:28:35] <Whirl3d_> since .hasChildren() is a common method name
[05:29:01] <Demonen> Well, technically, I didn't.  A much more CSS-savvy friend of mine did for me.
[05:29:20] <Demonen> But yeah, I could easily rename it something like .parent, but that's just as bad.
[05:29:26] <Demonen> .isContainer?
[05:29:41] <Whirl3d_> sure....or hasKids
[05:29:42] <xec> `xy @ Demonen
[05:29:45] <xec> ?xy @ Demonen
[05:29:46] <bot-t> Demonen, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[05:30:03] <Whirl3d_> xec, that's cute.
[05:30:09] <xec> Demonen: maybe try to explain what you're really trying to achieve
[05:30:56] <Demonen> xec: Applying the "open" class to all <li>s above $(this) in the tree if they already have the hasChildren class
[05:31:08] <Demonen> Note:  Renaming hasChildren to isFolder, methings.
[05:31:10] <Demonen> ...methinks
[05:31:34] <xec> Demonen: what is "this" in this context. i tried to do $("#menu .current") on your page but got null back
[05:31:36] <Whirl3d_> they have to have the hasChildren class if they are parents, right?
[05:32:32] <Demonen> xec:  That's odd, because in the menu on the left (<ul id="menu">), "Sporks and their use" is <a class="current">
[05:32:32] <xec> Demonen: but what's the overall goal of this? you want to mark someting as opened?
[05:33:02] <xec> Demonen: i also did $ === jQuery and got false ;)
[05:33:02] <Demonen> Yes, the serverside decides what item is "current" and flags it as such in the HTML via the class.
[05:33:50] <Demonen> https://dev.webkonsept.com/etc/js/webkonsept.js
[05:33:51] <xec> Demonen: doing jQuery("#menu .current") gives me a single item - is it always going to be one match?
[05:33:53] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tvr48/
[05:34:11] <Whirl3d_> There's your isolated test case
[05:34:23] <Demonen> xec: Nope, not at all, hence the .each(function(){
[05:34:57] <Demonen> wow Whirl3d_, thanks a bunch.
[05:35:54] <Demonen> On fiddle, how do I "update" the fiddlage.
[05:35:54] <Demonen> ?
[05:36:05] <Demonen> I've changed the javaScript.
[05:36:24] <Whirl3d_> in your function, you have item.parents("li.hasChildren').addClass('open');   perhaps you want item.closest(li.hasChildren....
[05:36:30] <xec> click the button marked "update" :)
[05:36:46] <Whirl3d_> enter your changes, click the update and then share the url back here
[05:36:55] <Demonen> Hello, my name is Demmy, and I am retarded.
[05:36:58] <Demonen> Thanks xec
[05:38:11] <xec> Demonen: could it be that it's just a typo in the classname?
[05:38:27] <xec> "li.hasChildern"...
[05:38:35] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tvr48/2/
[05:38:45] <Demonen> lol xec
[05:38:47] <Demonen> It is
[05:38:50] <Demonen> Hahahaha, dammit
[05:38:57] <Demonen> Thanks a whole bunch
[05:39:04] <Whirl3d_> i said 80%, I meant 90%
[05:39:05] <Whirl3d_> lol
[05:39:15] <Demonen> You too, Whirl3d_, for making me see the Wisdom of Fiddle
[05:39:28] <Whirl3d_> look at the fiddle I posted, I think it does what you want
[05:40:12] <Demonen> It does, but so does mine, once I successfully spell "Children"
[05:42:55] <Whirl3d_> Demonen, set the noneFound option to current and try yours...just curious
[05:44:11] <Demonen> "the noneFound option"?
[05:44:31] <Whirl3d_> under serious
[05:44:39] <Whirl3d_> the only one that is two levels deep
[05:44:49] <Whirl3d_> and remove the sporks current
[05:45:07] <Whirl3d_> I'm curious if yours will get both parents and grandparents to open
[05:46:20] <Demonen> Whirl3d_: Yes, they do open fine.
[05:46:21] <pachet> Whirl3d: are you still working on your issue, or did you fix it?
[05:46:39] <Whirl3d_> Okay, back to work...I have an array of terms  (and extra data) that I load using AJAX in JSON format...no problems. For the fiddle, I just pasted it as an array, so just skip over that...My problem is that it is missing some of the terms...and I can't find a pattern as to why some are missing and some arent'.   http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/558uh/10/
[05:46:53] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/KT3pe/
[05:46:57] <pachet> Whirl3d^
[05:46:58] <Demonen> ".parents()", unlike ".parent()", searches all the way up the DOM tree, IIRC.
[05:47:20] <pachet> Whirl3d: look at the markup, i commented out the offending tags
[05:48:20] <anli_> Can I listen for an img src loaded?
[05:49:01] <pachet> anli_: yes
[05:49:20] <Demonen> Whirl3d_: Could it be that you're sort of assuming "term" is not regex-significant in unexpected ways?
[05:49:41] <pachet> $('<img/>').on('load.mynamespace', function(){alert('done');}).attr('src', 'foo.jpg');
[05:49:44] <pachet> anli_ ^
[05:49:48] <Whirl3d_> pachet, thanks, I just grabbed the pages and pasted them. THe problem is that Abbyssimiam Scintar Bill (or whatever) is not getting replaced, for example.
[05:50:29] <anli_> Dp I need to add .mynamespace?

[05:50:50] <durre> how can I force a redraw of a div? hide().show() works, but makes the screen flicker… is there another way?
[05:50:50] <pachet> Whirl3d_: there's still a couple of mismatches, where the search term has a trailing space, etc
[05:51:08] <pachet> anli_: you dont need to, but i find it makes things more maintainable
[05:51:10] <Whirl3d_> No, and neither is African Paradise Flycatcher....there are multiple instances of them.
[05:51:27] <anli_> pachet: Thanks!
[05:51:37] <Whirl3d_> hmm. maybe that's the problem. I'll keep checking. I really appreciate your help, thanks.
[05:52:02] <pachet> Whirl3d_: how strange

[05:52:23] <pachet> the Long-tailed Paradise Wtfbird is the one with the trailing space
[05:52:47] <Whirl3d_> I know but you see that its' not getting replaced...the WTF bird is no biggy, it's the paradise flytrap or wtf
[05:53:32] <Whirl3d_> Wait it grabbed one of them.
[05:53:51] <Whirl3d_> why not all three of the flycatcher's?

[05:54:26] <arussel> it is probably just one variable, but I can't find it
[05:55:35] <rethus> hoe can i check, if an id exist?
[05:55:41] <rethus> -hoe + how
[05:56:01] <Whirl3d_> aha it's replace (regex, )   not term...
[05:56:12] <pachet> Whirl3d_: heh yeah - was just typing that
[05:56:26] <pachet> Whirl3d_: that should sort it out :D

[05:57:17] <daum_> hey guys- i am doing a $.post and i want to serialize a few inputs which are arrays to include in the post to the server, what is the best way to do this, here is what i think i'm is something like $.post('someurl',{some:'thing',$("input[name='other[]']).serialize()},function().

[05:58:16] <pachet> Whirl3d_: its that original issue again
[05:58:21] <pachet> you close the '.content' div
[05:58:31] <Whirl3d_> how'd that happen?
[05:58:46] <pachet> '</div><div class='pageBody'>'
[05:58:46] <Whirl3d_> I was using your fiddle. Maybe I got an old one.
[05:58:51] <pachet> ah
[05:59:08] <Whirl3d_> I deleted those lines all together...trying it again...
[05:59:44] <daum_> i'm not trying to serialize my entire form and i need to include some extra parameters
[06:00:24] <Whirl3d_> wait, those lines aren't in there....
[06:00:52] <pachet> Ghost Birds

[06:08:41] <rethus> strange that on click on image the checkbox toggle, even if there is no function for that
[06:08:43] <rethus> why
[06:08:44] <b-ot> rethus: david_mark back?
[06:09:34] <thirdender> rethus: because you have the LABEL element wrapped around the IMG
[06:13:02] <rethus> strange, didn't work in my application
[06:13:18] <rethus> in my app i open a ui-dialoge... maybe cause of this`
[06:13:44] <saba> Hi, I have -moz-transition and -webkit-transition on the margin property in a class .ready. When I do $(elm).css('margin-top', '10px').addClass('ready') the margin-top is animated. Any suggestion on how to prevent this, apart from delaying the .addClass()?

[06:20:06] <pSouper> hi all, can i ask about hover / clicks on iPad? I have a situation where I touch the iPad and it registers as a "hover" (to show a tooltip/popup) then touch again to register as a "click" (scroll to div). The problem is that the element is still counted as "clicked" so when i touch it again it triggers the "click" action (scroll page) and not the "hover" action (show tooltip)
[06:20:23] <pSouper> I am lost as how to de-register the "click"
[06:20:47] <pSouper> on the iPad (all works perfect on non-touch devices)
[06:21:00] <rethus> i got : Object #<HTMLSpanElement> has no method 'closest'
[06:21:47] <Demonen> rethus: Wrap your this in $()?
[06:21:51] <pSouper> rethus - your calling an id but should call a class
[06:22:07] <pSouper> $('.list_mail').click(function(){
[06:23:03] <rethus> pSouper: thanks i found this.. and update it... Deamonen: didn't work anyway

[06:26:46] <Demonen> rethus: Explain again why you're not using <label>?
[06:26:57] <rethus> It doesn't work on my livepage
[06:27:26] <rethus> i don't know why.. maybe cause onclick i call a ui-dialoge...
[06:27:43] <rethus> how ever... try to check only closest checkbox... may this work
[06:28:20] <rethus> so may i do   4(this).closest('[name=vvid\[\]');
[06:29:15] <Demonen> I mean...
[06:29:15] <Demonen> http://jsfiddle.net/MAhFg/22/
[06:29:32] <Demonen> <label> requires an id to be for="" on, and that's all.
[06:29:49] <Demonen> It doesn't understand name="", needs id=""
[06:30:07] <Demonen> Why solve with JavaScript what is built-in functionality?
[06:31:33] <Demonen> In short:  Your wheel is looking a little square there, rethus.
[06:32:19] <rethus> can i even set label for="classname" ?
[06:32:27] <rethus> or have it to be id?
[06:32:56] <Demonen> It has to be an ID, but you're already using a name="" on your checkbox, so using the same for id="" should be unique enough, right?
[06:34:09] <Demonen> Also, target="_blanks"?  rel="external" :-P
[06:34:23] <Demonen> But no, I'm _not_ getting up on that perticular soap box today
[06:36:59] <Demonen> Whirl3d_: Sadly unrelated to your problem, but I've verified that .parents() does in deed climb infinitely high in the DOM tree while it still finds matches:
[06:37:06] <Demonen> https://dev.webkonsept.com/
[06:37:58] <Demonen> Now to implement a real menu in the backend, and that's not even related to some distant cousin of jQuery's roommate.
[06:40:47] <xec> Demonen: actually, i heard node.js has been sleeping with jquery
[06:41:05] <Demonen> Let's hope they don't get pregnant is all I say.
[06:41:16] <Demonen> And have a prototype
[06:41:20] <Demonen> [batam-tish]
[06:41:27] <Demonen> My backend is PSGI (perl)
[06:41:50] <xec> oh yeah that's right - you're the perl guy from #css the other day
[06:42:04] <Demonen> Absolutely correct.
[06:42:48] <xec> barely touched the stuff myself
[06:43:10] <xec> heard it gets you hooked though
[06:44:26] <rethus> Demonen: so if i give each checkbox an id like vid_1... vid_2 and write in the lable for="vid_1" it should work?
[06:45:08] <Demonen> rethus: Not "should".  "will"
[06:45:21] <Demonen> Provided there are no ID confusions with multiple items having the same ID
[06:45:27] <Demonen> Then the behaviour is undefined.
[06:46:38] <Whirl3d_> how does the browser tell if you are using a regular expression or a string (that looks like a regular expression). or does it care?
[06:47:09] <Demonen> It does it's best to use it as a regular expression, and if that fails, it just silently matches nothing and moves on.
[06:47:14] <xec> Whirl3d_: the question doesn't make sense really. you either have a regex object or a string
[06:47:23] <Whirl3d_> I would like to store my regexpressions in my database for lookup
[06:47:29] <teewuane> Whirl3d_: is it a string or a regex
[06:47:30] <teewuane> ?
[06:47:36] <xec> Whirl3d_: if the string "looks like a regex" it is still a string
[06:47:54] <Demonen> So yeah, make regex objects (which may fail and give usable error messages!) rather than just a string.
[06:47:59] <Whirl3d_> so no way to coerce it with eval() or some other hackish bs?
[06:48:20] <xec> Whirl3d_: coerce? in what sense?
[06:48:30] <xec> Whirl3d_: to create a regex out of a string?
[06:48:47] <ajpiano> Whirl3d_: you can pass a string to new RegExp()
[06:48:48] <rethus> Demonen: tada, and it wil not
[06:49:14] <Whirl3d_> but I had problems with passing new RegExp("/pattern/gi");
[06:49:17] <Demonen> rethus: parse error.
[06:49:33] <xec> Whirl3d_: flags are the second param, also lose the slashes
[06:49:36] <Whirl3d_> it wanted RegExp("pattern", "gi"); I think.
[06:49:40] <xec> right
[06:49:42] <Demonen> I'm pretty sure I asked you about your regex strings about an hour ago Whirl3d_ ;-)
[06:50:21] <Whirl3d_> right, so that's the issue, I have to strip our my regexp slashes to create a regexp...I was just hoping there was a way to do it all at once....
[06:50:23] <rethus> Demonen:no parse error here
[06:50:40] <Demonen> rethus: What you said produced a parse error in my head.
[06:50:44] <rethus> so back to my question.. how can i activate the checkbox with javascript - maybe the closest() function
[06:50:48] <Demonen> As in "WTF are you talking about?"
[06:51:13] <rethus> i don't know why, but its not working with this label.
[06:51:22] <Demonen> YOU DON'T, now stop inventing square wheels!
[06:51:34] <Demonen> Live example of it not working, please, so I can point out your error.

[06:53:15] <rethus> deamonen: ah, now i see my fault, i encapsulate the checkbox into this label
[06:53:15] <aquatix> ghehe
[06:53:17] <Demonen> Entirely optional unless there are spaces, and if there are, you're doing it wrong.
[06:53:20] <aquatix> <blink />

[06:53:45] <awelch> hey im looking for some help with my datepicker,
[06:54:08] <AL13N_work> does the new jquery have some kind of encodeHTML() function, or do we still have to use the $("<div />") workaround?
[06:54:10] <Demonen> asher^: Thank fuck for that!
[06:54:26] <Whirl3d_> got it: finally....thanks for your help all...  :http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/KT3pe/1/
[06:54:33] <asher^> hehe, <blink /> includes two annoyances in one
[06:54:43] * Demonen does the Whirl3d_ dance
[06:54:45] <asher^> although every time i see blink referenced it reminds me of the good ol days
[06:54:54] <Demonen> Excellent that you got it going.  Good luck on the image viewer.

[06:57:14] <Whirl3d_> African or European?

[06:57:56] <Anticom> hi all
[06:58:24] <awelch> really? i mean i found some UIs online that look like what im trying to do, but im just not sure how to use it with date picker
[06:58:34] <Anticom> what's the difference between $.ajax(...).done(function() {...}); and $.ajax({success: function() {...}}); ??
[06:58:49] <Demonen> Anticom: Even if it fails, it's still done.
[06:58:58] <Anticom> makes sense...
[06:59:03] <Anticom> thank's Demonen
[06:59:11] <Demonen> nemas problemas
[06:59:14] <awelch> http://cssglobe.com/post/4380/easy-tooltip--jquery-plugin
[06:59:47] <Demonen> Also, I must admit that HTML5 and the data="" property is too sexy for my site.
[07:00:00] <Demonen> And jQuery's data="" handling is silky smooth.
[07:00:13] <asher^> jquery ui 1.9 has tooltips natively i think, ive been using the tooltips from jquerytools in the mean time
[07:01:01] <Anticom> Demonen furthermore html5 overall is still not grown up properly
[07:01:27] <asher^> data-*= is amazingly useful
[07:01:30] <awelch> okay, im not gonna lie, im still very new to programming and jQuery
[07:01:35] <Anticom> concerning tooltips: http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/stylish-jquery-tooltip-plugins-webdesign/ here's a collection of some plugins
[07:02:23] <Demonen> Anticom: Close enough for me.  I'm working on stuff that won't be in any kind of real use for -months- yet.
[07:02:46] <Demonen> By then, IE10 might have been released for real, and hardly suck at all.
[07:03:04] <Anticom> Demonen i can't wait for device access on mobile devices in the browser
[07:03:22] <Anticom> specs are still wip afaik :/
[07:03:38] <mbroadst> is there a way for me to dynamically load(..) another page into a jquery dialog while potentially executing javascript that might be included in the page I'm loading in, all without using a predefined div on the page (ie. this stuff is loaded in to a dialog and all of it just goes away when the dialog is closed)?
[07:03:42] <Demonen> Well, I'm solving that by shaking my fist at the mobile browser and writing an app.
[07:04:06] <Demonen> mbroadst: You mean cross-site scripting?
[07:04:49] <Demonen> Or what?
[07:05:01] <mbroadst> Demonen: I've got no idea if that constitutes cross site scripting, we're using this to load dialogs for actions in our web2py app
[07:05:03] <mbroadst> well, we would lie to
[07:05:06] <mbroadst> like*
[07:05:37] <Demonen> Aha, then not xss, good, because that is complicated and sometimes evil.
[07:05:43] <fuchstronaut> is there a reliable way to warn the user before leaving a page (without saving)?
[07:05:44] <mbroadst> currently crud actions in our controller are .load()'ed into a side pane, I just want to display it in a modal dialog
[07:05:53] <Demonen> Well, what do you mean by "go away"?
[07:06:06] <mbroadst> oh, just not remain in the dom
[07:06:36] <Demonen> fuchstronaut: Yes, onunload or onclose or somesuch.  I forget it's name.
[07:07:24] <Demonen> mbroadst: Put it in a <script> tag and drop it shold be dropped from DOM when it's parent is.
[07:07:40] <Demonen> Oh wait, .load() is the one that strips out script, isn't it?
[07:08:07] <mbroadst> Demonen: no, I think its .ajax that does that, .load seems to work, but it requires that I have a predefined element to load into
[07:08:25] <Demonen> mbroadst: Load to body?
[07:08:41] <Demonen> Mind the z-index ;-)
[07:09:28] <Demonen> mbroadst: Surely you have some overall top element, like #content or #stuff, or whatever?
[07:09:39] <Demonen> But urr, .load() replaces that content
[07:09:43] <Demonen> I don't think you want .load
[07:09:52] <Demonen> Try .fetch() or .get()
[07:21:49] <Anticom> is there a way to prevent an event temporarily? i want a prompt to pop up, when the user clicks the submit button of a form, so he still has the option to cancel the submission. Alternativley i could use a way emulate native submission in js... i just don't want to use ajax on that one
[07:23:59] <Demonen> Anticom: use a .click() on the button, and .preventDefault()?
[07:24:34] <xec> Anticom: you could use confirm() which halts execution
[07:24:40] <Anticom> Demonen but if the user decides everything is okay and he relay wants to submit the form, i can't undo the .preventDefault() when he clicks on "ok"
[07:24:43] <Anticom> or can i?
[07:25:00] <Demonen> Then you want confirm(), like xec said.
[07:25:19] <Anticom> is that native js or jquery?
[07:25:24] <xec> native
[07:25:28] <Anticom> k, thx
[07:25:39] <Demonen> np, dolby digital
[07:25:59] <Anticom> xec and that work's with input type="submit" too?
[07:26:48] <xec> Anticom: if you're listening to the submit event, sure. do something like if (!confirm()) e.preventDefault();
[07:26:50] <Anticom> point is i want to send data of the form using POST, so it's hidden at least from the "noobs" :D
[07:27:18] <Anticom> but there's no jquery style solution to that, is there?
[07:27:30] <Anticom> actually i wanted to use the jq-ui dialog
[07:27:31] <Anticom> :/
[07:28:12] <Demonen> There is ALWAYS a jQuery solution to it, but you don't always need one (ref <label> thing discussed earlier)
[07:28:57] <Anticom> Demonen problem is, that my whole app uses the jq-ui stuff with it's nice styling and stuff... and now i'd have to use that ugly prompt supplied by the browser
[07:29:19] <xec> Anticom: you could of course circumvent the entire form submission and replace it with an ajax call relatively easily
[07:30:13] <xec> Anticom: then you have complete freedom in deciding what, how and if you post something
[07:30:54] <Demonen> I send POST requests with jQuery all the time.  No problem.
[07:31:27] <Anticom> xec originaly the response was meant to be a pdf directly and that would cause problems with the headers and stuff send, to indicate to the browser, that a pdf is coming
[07:31:52] <Anticom> Demonen that's what i do too, but in that case it's a little more complicated as u just described
[07:32:45] <Demonen> Yeah, if you're expecting a PDF back, then ajaxifying the submission is probably a very bad idea.
[07:32:47] <xec> you could probably .submit() the form conditionally
[07:33:03] <Anticom> and i don't want to implement like 200 workarounds for that (i know i could let the server send back the location of the pdf and use js to relocate the browser to that adress and so on and so on... but i don't want to)
[07:33:28] <Demonen> Yeah, listen for the submission and intercept, then, if the user wants to and all is well, .submit().  I agree with xec.
[07:33:46] <Anticom> i thought .submit() was ajax too :O
[07:34:01] <Demonen> Doesn't have to be at all, no.
[07:34:32] <Demonen> Just $('#someform').submit(); will simply submit the <form id="someform"> as if the submit button was clicked.
[07:34:34] <Anticom> i know it's bad to ask you for that, but could one of you set up a minimalistic example in jsfiddle?
[07:34:46] <Anticom> haha you were faster than me^^
[07:35:06] <rethus> is there a chance to get status of a input type="email" field with jquery?
[07:35:19] <rethus> i have a dialoge... and only if email is valid, form should be submited.
[07:35:31] <Anticom> so it would be .preventDefault on document ready and $('#form').submit() on button handler of the dialog (?)
[07:36:05] <Anticom> rethus what you mean by "status" ??
[07:36:29] <Anticom> there are a couple of form validation plugins... most of them with build in email validation
[07:36:37] <rethus> Anticom: means if i enter a wrong mail-adress... status may be fault, false or 0
[07:37:09] <rethus> yes, but if not strongly needed, a simple html5 validateion fit my needs
[07:38:25] <Demonen> rethus: So what you're really asking for is a regex that will validate an email address?
[07:39:05] <Demonen> 30 seconds on google will give you about 200 of them, and they all have their drawbacks.  Email addresses are not easily validatable.
[07:39:08] <dilvie> my favorite validation plugin is h5validate - but I'm biassed.
[07:39:11] <dilvie> I wrote it.
[07:39:33] <rethus> i know regex and that kind of validation... i don't mean this... mhh don't know how to ask...
[07:39:33] <Demonen> lol dilvie, you're supposed to love it best when you wrote it.  If not:  Rewrite time!
[07:39:33] <Anticom> Demonen i think he want's to know, how to access, what the browser thinks about the input in terms of validity (i don't even know wether that word exists :D)
[07:40:04] <Demonen> "validity" is a word.
[07:40:09] <rethus> my question is: does those new internal html5 validation function a point where i could catch the state of the validation into my jquery-script
[07:40:30] <Demonen> Se THAT is a real question!
[07:40:35] <xec> rethus: i'm pretty sure there is a shim for making html5 input types work in older browser, but i cant find it at the moment
[07:40:39] <Demonen> My answer:  I have no idea, but probably, yeah.
[07:40:48] <ajpiano> rethus: there is a javascript API for checking the html5 inputs, yes
[07:40:56] <dilvie> rethus: don't use the html5 validation without a polyfill. You'll have serious browser compatibility issues. Do check out h5validate
[07:41:11] <rethus> ajpiano: great, you understand what i try to ask
[07:41:14] <ajpiano> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2421218/do-any-browsers-yet-support-html5s-checkvalidity-method
[07:41:22] <Anticom> rethus http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5272433/html5-form-required-attribute-set-custom-validation-message this is not what yuo want but it still might answer your question
[07:41:30] <Anticom> there seems to be a way in native js
[07:41:51] <Anticom> there seems to be an API for stuff like that
[07:42:11] <dilvie> Anticom: Yes, there is a way, but it sucks for cross browser compatibility. IE, your validations will fail completely on a bunch of browsers.
[07:42:42] <Anticom> dilvie i wasn't judging... just answering his question... i'd do it the good old regex-way too (:
[07:43:02] <awelch> this is driviing me insane
[07:43:27] <dilvie> rethus: http://ericleads.com/h5validate/
[07:43:34] <rethus> dilvie, anticom, ajpiano: thanks for the hint.. i know, its still better not to use only html5 validation... i even ask for further using, if html5 run on each browsers... and cause i'm just curious :D
[07:44:05] <rethus> dilvie: thats also a great link. thanks
[07:44:19] <dilvie> rethus: h5validate is running in production with about 70 million monthly active users and works in IE6
[07:44:42] <dilvie> 70 million just on the projects I've used it in.. not counting the wider community.
[07:45:48] <awelch> can anyone help me?
[07:45:56] <dilvie> and I'm about to incorporate it into another high profile project that will add 20 million more monthly active users. In other words, it's a battle-tested solution for html5 form validation.
[07:46:32] <dilvie> Not bug-free, but fair to say a far cry better than home-grown regex solutions.
[07:48:12] <Whirl3d_> dilvie, what's one of these 50+ million sites you've built?
[07:49:13] <teotwaki> Hi, when using jQuery UI Position, in my testing I've not been able to get the positioning to work unless I set the width and height of the element I wish to position in px. Is there a reason to this? Or am I just doing things wrong.
[07:49:32] <draginx> Any idea why when I do $('..').on('click', ....); it works just fine but when I use google's JS compressor it triggers *twice* instead of just once?
[07:49:59] <dilvie> Whirl3d_: Zumba Fitness shopping cart (the source of the 1,000 user usability survey), BandPage (most popular music app on facebook).. adding soon to Tout (another ~20 million monthly actives)
[07:50:31] <dilvie> Whirl3d_: Conducted the realtime validation best practices study at Zumba Fitness
[07:51:30] <dilvie> we reduced shopping cart abandonment rates by 12 percent after replacing a homegrown regex validation solution with h5Validate at Zumba Fitness -- bottom line impact was worth millions of dollars
[07:57:25] <Alex_> how could i do something, before the default event of an <a> runs?
[07:59:43] <ManT> Hi Everyone
[07:59:59] <gain_> Alex_: I know only that you can bind and unbind functions, but dunno how to order them...
[08:01:11] <silverwind> Alex_, events are like a stack
[08:01:23] <ManT> I'm trying to make ajax, jsonp, get request, but I'm getting errors like: invalid label, parsererror. Whats can be wrong with that? My data is: {"d":"3cd5486-c123-4692-b314-4d4d4d4d4d4d"}
[08:02:00] <silverwind> Alex_, the last binding you added will be executed first.. then if you want to not execute the other events, you can call e.stopPropagation();
[08:02:18] <silverwind> ManT, do you know the JSONP format?
[08:02:34] <silverwind> (hint: it's not JSON)
[08:02:48] <ManT> silverwind, it's default response from the server, I'm not really able to change it.
[08:02:53] <shwaiil> Q: I've got  $('.drag').mousedown(function(e){ ... }); that doesn't work on iPad. Any tips on how to fix it ? Thank you
[08:03:18] <silverwind> ManT, then you're f....d, you need to create a proxy on your own server.
[08:04:03] <silverwind> ?js JSON.parse('{"d":"3cd5486-c123-4692-b314-4d4d4d4d4d4d"}');
[08:04:06] <bot-t> silverwind: {"d": "3cd5486-c123-4692-b314-4d4d4d4d4d4d"}
[08:04:25] <ManT> So, its working?
[08:04:48] <silverwind> ManT, the string you pasted is valid JSON but not JSONP
[08:05:13] <silverwind> A JSONP response would look like:     myCallback({"d": "3cd5486-c123-4692-b314-4d4d4d4d4d4d"});
[08:05:28] <silverwind> myCallback being the name of the callback passed as a get parameter
[08:05:35] <dilvie> ManT: jQuery has built-in support for JSONP -- you just have to tell it that it's JSONP
[08:05:50] <silverwind> dilvie, the server needs to support it...
[08:06:01] <silverwind> JSONP is not a client-side only thing
[08:06:34] <dilvie> ManT: What silverwind said. ^^
[08:07:02] <ManT> Mhmm.
[08:07:04] <dilvie> The server needs to wrap the data with the JSONP callback.
[08:07:08] <ManT> Ok, I will try to change to json.
[08:07:27] <ManT> How can I wrap it? I  need to make cross domain calls, so I need JSONP.
[08:07:37] <ManT> Is it enough to add callback: "something" ?
[08:08:32] <dilvie> straight json won't work cross-origin without proper headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
[08:08:37] <silverwind> ManT, a JSONP call is like that: http://server.com?callback=theCallbackNamehere   then the server returns: theCallbackNamehere(jsonhere);
[08:08:54] <silverwind> Yeah, CORS is another solution.. but doesn't work on older IEs
[08:09:43] <ManT> silverwind, ok thanks. I will try this.
[08:09:44] <dilvie> ManT: there are jsonp libs for a variety of server-side environments, including php, ruby on rails, java
[08:10:25] <dilvie> a lot of mvc frameworks have built-in jsonp views
[08:14:09] <shwaiil> I'm not having mousedown working on the ipad. is there a way to fix it ? tks
[08:14:22] <shwaiil> *using it to drag one element
[08:15:44] <karl_heinz> hi, looking for a way to make an element invisible (not hide) while keeping the place of the element
[08:16:56] <silverwind> karl_heinz, You don't know CSS? :/
[08:16:58] <ajpiano> karl_heinz: #foo { visibility: hidden; }
[08:18:09] <karl_heinz> I should toggle it to a class then? I barely know CSS
[08:19:30] <silverwind> Yeah, you should always toggle classes
[08:19:37] <silverwind> Never add inline css
[08:19:51] <silverwind> (Except for things like animations..)
[08:21:31] <karl_heinz> ok good
[08:21:59] <karl_heinz> I know some CSS, but when it comes to JS and HTML I try to follow the rules and make clean code but I never know for sure the right way
[08:23:28] <Industrial> karl_heinz: luckily these things are very well defined and fast to look up
[08:24:18] <Industrial> autodidacts paradise ;o
[08:26:15] <karl_heinz> Industrial: what things are well defined? I don't think they are, unless you're referring to something else
[08:30:10] <Industrial> karl_heinz: html, css, javascript. What you need for a minimal document
[08:31:39] <Alex_> silverwind: but how could i fire the event from the <a>-tag, after i stopped it with event.preventDefault() ?
[08:32:04] <teotwaki> Hi, when using jQuery UI Position, in my testing I've not been able to get the positioning to work unless I set the width and height of the element I wish to position in px. Is there a reason to this? Or am I just doing things wrong.
[08:32:05] <karl_heinz> Industrial: well the practices aren't well defined; that's what I'm referring to
[08:32:17] <Alex_> silverwind: between this ther should run an animtation
[08:38:52] <alcuadrado> preventing the default behavior in click event handler doesn't let me use wheel click on chrome, but it does on firefox. any ideas?
[08:39:04] <anew_> i cant figure out on success what is happening here, what do i send to this jq with php http://pastebin.com/15uLzgkR
[08:39:23] <Alex_> someone know, why the <a> links aren't working after the animation? http://jsfiddle.net/qLEJu/1/
[08:39:43] <GhostBear> Hello. I'm having a weird problem. I appended checkbox into target element and for some reason checkbox doesn't work. I can't check or uncheck it (if checked specificed in html code).
[08:39:53] <GhostBear> There is no binds on it or anything
[08:42:19] <guy> Anyone here is familiar with http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/methods.html? I have `itemSelector : '.thumbnails > .entry-thumbnail:visible',` option. Then some elements are .hide()[en] dynamically. I try calling `reloadItems` and `reLayout` but none works.
[08:42:42] <guy> The hidden elements (although not visible) are still taking place in the layout
[08:44:39] <[fields]> anybody got experience with jquerymobile?  nobody seems to talk in #jquerymobile
[08:44:43] <[fields]> I'm about to design an app and use jQuery to make a 1 page app that is "many pages", but as I dynamically rewrite the contents of divs to contain new forms and displays I lose all of the natural jquerymobile style (curved inputs and buttons and such) Anyone know what that's about and how to get around the problem?
[08:49:56] <thang> [fields]: hm not sure but when i was writing a mobile site id change the useragent in chrome and poke around with the inspector to see what was going on better
[08:50:51] <[fields]> thang:  I found my answer from someone in #phonegap.   trigger('create') or the old way was using .page();
[08:51:06] <[fields]> thanks for your help tho
[08:57:31] <awelch> why doesnt this work?
[08:57:34] <awelch> selectedGroup=2; 			if (event) { 			switch(selectedGroup){ 			case 1: window.location = "http://www.google.com/"; 			case 2: window.location= "http://www.yahoo.com"; 			case 3: window.location = "htpp://www.reddit.com"; 			case 4: window.location= "http://www.memebase.com"; 			} 				 			}
[08:57:57] <asher^> you need some break;s
[08:58:27] <awelch> what does that mean?
[08:58:38] <asher^> also, thats not a jquery question. also, using switch in js is not advisible
[08:59:18] <awelch> sorry, im using jQuery with it
[09:00:34] <dilvie> I"m excited for the sizzle improvements in jQuery 1.8
[09:00:35] <dilvie> yay!
[09:00:48] <asher^> what are they improving?
[09:01:17] <Whirl3d_> Alex_, did anyone respond to your question yet?
[09:01:44] <[fields]> jquery.com still says current release is v1.7.2
[09:02:29] <NoiseEee> asher^: using switch in Js is not advisable?
[09:03:01] <asher^> NoiseEee according to doug crockford
[09:03:18] <silverwind> switch is rarely a good option in JS..
[09:03:32] <ajpiano> asher^: [fields] http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/04/the-new-sizzle/
[09:03:42] <asher^> thanks
[09:04:04] <silverwind> For 2-3 cases, use "if"s... for more, usually a map is better than a switch
[09:06:42] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to "force" select boxes to open with jQuery? I'm calling some data from the database, and it would be nice to "open" the select box as soon as it is filled with data, so that saves the user one click, and makes them realize they have to chose one.
[09:07:25] <silverwind> :/
[09:07:43] <silverwind> That's a bad idea.. but you could try to call .click() on the select
[09:07:44] <FernandoBasso> I mean, I'm filling select boxes based on what the user has already chosen.
[09:08:07] <silverwind> FernandoBasso, Users have expectations when they use a UI...
[09:08:23] <silverwind> You opening the select box isn't of one of them
[09:08:39] <silverwind> It will be weird.
[09:09:01] <FernandoBasso> silverwind: I understand that's a good point you've made.
[09:09:03] <FernandoBasso> Thanks.
[09:09:52] <silverwind> Like I said, you could try selecting the select box and call .click() on it, not sure if it works though
[09:10:02] <JJMalina> If I want to temporarily bind a click handler using .click() and then unbind it, how do I do that? Should I use .bind() to add it instead?
[09:10:30] <ajpiano> JJMalina: you only want the handler to happen once?
[09:10:56] <Anticom> I'm getting an error when trying to submit an ajax call (and the success handler isn't executed) http://jsfiddle.net/NNZQk/
[09:11:02] <Anticom> any ideas what's going wrong?
[09:11:15] <shoky> FernandoBasso: and anyway, there is no way to force it on a regulat native select-box
[09:11:15] <JJMalina> ajpiano: no, it's based on a toggle state, so when the state is enabled I want to prevent links from working
[09:11:22] <shoky> regular*
[09:11:38] <ajpiano> JJMalina: ah, then you should probably just never unbind the handler and instead have it read the flag
[09:11:51] <ajpiano> and put the logic inside of a block that checks the flag is in the right state
[09:12:08] <ajpiano> JJMalina: in any case, you can unbind events bound with click or bind or on all with .off() or .unbind()
[09:12:49] <JJMalina> ok thanks. I'll try .off
[09:13:05] <ajpiano> JJMalina: like i said, not convinced you ever need to unbind to begin with
[09:15:07] <Anticom> okay sille me solved the problem
[09:15:11] <Anticom> silly*
[09:15:41] <shoky> $.
[09:18:50] <trumpetmic> anyone using <frameset> anymore?
[09:19:18] <silverwind> Not really..deprecated.
[09:19:37] <[fields]> trumpetmic: I haven't in close to a decade... sometimes iframe is a decent solution, but very rarely.
[09:21:20] <trumpetmic> what would you recommend as a better alternative to <frameset>
[09:22:16] <int> what's the best way to redirect a user to a url on button click?
[09:22:24] <sigger> Hi, i've searched the docs and tryed different things, but i'd really appreciate some help of more adanced jquery authors. Certain parts of my web page get reloaded via ajax. All i need to do is to watch for $("input[type=''checkbox]') in the reloaded area and work with it. I'am currently trying .on but i'am not sure what event i should listen on?
[09:22:36] <int> $(location).attr('href',url); is working on document ready but not on button click event for some reason
[09:23:33] <[fields]> int:  strange.  having a background in DOM, I would try the dom equivalent:  window.location.href=url;
[09:23:43] <[fields]> or often just location.href=url; is suffice
[09:24:51] <asher^> int have you confirmed that the on click event is firing correctly?
[09:25:19] * [fields] agrees with asher.  your location jquery code seems fine.
[09:25:29] <ajpiano> there is absolutely no reason to use jquery for that
[09:25:31] <int> asher^: yes I have a alert before the redirection
[09:25:44] <ajpiano> window.location =
[09:25:45] <int> ajpiano: I know, I tried normal location.href too
[09:25:57] <int> the alert fires on btn click event
[09:25:57] <JJMalina> ajpiano do you have an example of binding once and passing a flag? not entirely sure how to make that work
[09:26:00] <ajpiano> $(location).attr(.... is a complete waste of time
[09:26:10] <ajpiano> JJMalina: it's not "passing" anything
[09:26:15] <int> ajpiano: I was trying that because normal code wasn't working
[09:26:19] <karl_heinz> I'm using jQuery-Validation-Engine and I want to remove validation for a select box. I'm not finding any other way to do this except for disabling the element.
[09:26:22] <int> it works on document ready for some reason
[09:26:24] <int> weird
[09:27:18] <int> I have "<button type="submit" class="btn btnUser">Filter by User</button>"
[09:27:38] <int> and " $(".btnUser").click(function() { "
[09:27:44] <ajpiano> JJMalina: var ITS_COOL_TO_LET_IT_THIS_HAPPEN = true; $("#foo").click( function( ) { if (ITS_COOL_TO_LET_THIS_HAPPEN) { /*do stuff*/ });  $("#ThingThatChangesTheState").click(function() { ITS_COOL_TO_LET_IT_THIS_HAPPEN = !ITS_COOL_TO_LET_IT_THIS_HAPPEN; });
[09:27:47] <int> under this I am doing alert and then the redirect
[09:27:52] <int> the alert fires but not the redirect
[09:29:19] <JJMalina> ajpiano: mmk thought I wasn't supposed to use click() twice. thanks
[09:29:38] <ajpiano> JJMalina: i have no idea what your app is doing
[09:29:51] <ajpiano> my sample above assumed there were two different buttons
[09:29:54] <ajpiano> that may or may not be the cas
[09:29:56] <int> nevermind I figured it out, that button was inside a form
[09:29:57] <ajpiano> case*
[09:32:17] <dilvie> Anybody want to give a talk at an SFJS meetup on August 7th?

[09:34:14] <teotwaki> Hi, when using jQuery UI Position, in my testing I've not been able to get the positioning to work unless I set the width and height of the element I wish to position in px. Is there a reason to this? Or am I just doing things wrong.
[09:36:16] <sigger> Is there no default listener for Ajax changes or something? I'am sure this is some kind of common usecase. The only possibilty i see is to listen .on "DOMSubtreeModified"
[09:37:24] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: THE SAVIOR :)
[09:37:51] <RohanBhangui> coldhead: hey
[09:37:55] <RohanBhangui> imsky: hey
[09:38:17] <RohanBhangui> rabbil: i dont think Whirl3d_ is reall god
[09:38:49] <ajpiano> sigger: it's kind of a common anti-pattern
[09:38:55] <hakan> hi there!
[09:39:08] <ajpiano> DOM mutation events have been thrown out in favour of "Mutation Observers"
[09:39:12] <hakan> I have a question about selectors
[09:39:19] <RohanBhangui> ya
[09:39:21] <ajpiano> and in general, listening for events in markup that your own app is injecting is kind of backward.
[09:39:34] <RohanBhangui> hakan: jsut ask
[09:39:40] <RohanBhangui> no need for permission
[09:39:44] <RohanBhangui> well try to help
[09:39:47] <sigger> you are right. But i'am not able to attach something to the callback methods. How should something like watching on changes content be done?
[09:39:49] <hakan> I have part of html dynamically generated. sometimes it is generated as ul and il elements. other times it is generated as table tr td elements.
[09:40:16] <ajpiano> sigger: what type of changes to the content are you trying to watch for
[09:40:20] <RohanBhangui> okay
[09:40:28] <hakan> for ul li I have a function $("#name ul li")... but I would like to make that so, that same function can be used for both types
[09:40:39] <RohanBhangui> um
[09:40:41] <RohanBhangui> okay
[09:40:53] <RohanBhangui> so do the tr and td elements also have #name?
[09:41:03] <sigger> ajpiano: I try to manipulate INPUTs that get loaded via ajax
[09:41:06] <[fields]> should a id of submit (#submit) be avoided ?
[09:41:08] <hakan> all tr and li elements have same id
[09:41:18] <ajpiano> sigger: so, before i put you through the ringer, there are some jquery hack-ish solutions to do what you want
[09:41:19] <RohanBhangui> which is #name?
[09:41:24] <ajpiano> sigger: see ?newContent
[09:41:25] <bot-t> sigger, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[09:41:36] <hakan> I just need to select a specific td (the first in the row)
[09:41:44] <ajpiano> this will give you the type of event you're looking for, assuming the content is inserted using jQuery's manipulation methods
[09:42:00] <RohanBhangui> um i would use just $("#name")
[09:42:06] <RohanBhangui> i would need to see a fiddle
[09:42:09] <RohanBhangui> to tell you for sure
[09:42:14] <hakan> ok: example:
[09:42:17] <RohanBhangui> but based on your description thats what i would do
[09:42:21] <sigger> oh ok thank you ajpiano, i will look into that. I just want to understand what is the best practive for this kind of problem
[09:42:38] <ajpiano> sigger: but the point is, you already have a callback when the data arrives, that is a sufficient time to kick off your manipulation
[09:43:07] <hakan> first case: <div id="output"><ul><li>blah</li><li>next</li>....
[09:43:24] <hakan> so with $("#output ul li") I can put a function on it
[09:43:28] <hakan> in other case:
[09:43:36] <ajpiano> hakan: if you want to write a selector that will work in all situations, use classes on all the elements and don't use elements in the selector
[09:43:53] <ajpiano> $("#output .item")
[09:43:58] <ajpiano> and then put .item on all the trs and all the lis
[09:44:00] <ajpiano> or something like that
[09:44:19] <hakan> <div id="output"><table><tr><td>first</td><td>additional</td></tr><tr><td>next first</td>...
[09:44:36] <hakan> ah ok
[09:44:44] <hakan> I just give the elements a class
[09:44:45] <sigger> ajpiano: ok you are so right, and thank you very much. So the best way would be to use the ajax-callbacks for new manipulation. Thats something I can work with. Now i'am looking for the best work arround, since i can't change the event handlers 8(
[09:44:59] <RohanBhangui> hakan: you should consider using jsfiddle.net instead of apsting code
[09:45:10] <RohanBhangui> that way people can see working examples and hel pyou better
[09:45:13] <ajpiano> sigger: do you have to physically replace the inputs that come in with some like, enhanced control
[09:45:19] <ajpiano> sigger: or do you just need to bind handlers to the inputs
[09:45:22] <hakan> oh I did not of jsfidlle.net
[09:45:29] <hakan> next time I will use. Thank you very much!
[09:45:46] <RohanBhangui> ya it does all your javascript development and jquery development much easier
[09:45:55] <RohanBhangui> and better for those who are trying to help
[09:46:00] <RohanBhangui> good luck
[09:46:04] <hakan> thx! :)
[09:46:21] <sigger> No i'ts really cheap actually. I want to .wrap the input and clone the label. That way i can switch each Checkbox for a iOS like control
[09:46:34] <Patrik2> Hey guys, my code won't work after adding line 2, but I can't seem to find anything wrong with it. http://pastebin.com/S9sCGyEH
[09:47:25] <ajpiano> Patrik2: that's not valid syntax for an object
[09:47:38] <Patrik2> #adleft ?
[09:47:46] <ajpiano> it's either .css("position", "fixed") or .css({"position": "fixed"})
[09:47:53] <Patrik2> Oh...
[09:47:54] <ajpiano> no, the javascript object you are passing as the argument to css
[09:48:00] <ajpiano> is not syntac...ok
[09:48:26] <sigger> so you where right, yes i want to do the first thing. But you question is interesting ajpiano. Why do you ask? Are event handlers "live" even on elements that was loaded with ajax? (sorry for my english)
[09:48:53] <Patrik2> IF I want to add several css attributes, what's the proper way to write it?
[09:49:17] <ajpiano> sigger: if you use event delegation to attach the events, then they will be quote unquote "live"
[09:49:31] <ajpiano> sigger: cause you can handle the events when they bubble up to a container that was in the DOM the whole time

[09:50:10] <sigger> ok good to know. Thank you very much ajpiano
[09:50:23] <ajpiano> Patrik2: .css( {color: "#fff", position: "fixed"} );
[09:50:38] <Patrik2> ajpiano, thx!

[09:51:31] <RohanBhangui> cool
[09:52:51] <Patrik2> Well, now the code gets processed (the alert is showing), but the element isn't receiving the CSS attributes. Can this be caused by the element getting printed after the function is processed?
[09:53:44] <ajpiano> Patrik2: yes
[09:53:58] <ajpiano> Patrik2: $("#foo") says GO GET THE FOO ELEMENT and then modify its CSS properties
[09:54:09] <ajpiano> if there's nothing to get, there's no properties to modify
[09:54:28] <ajpiano> Patrik2: if you need to write styles for all elements on the page, regardless of when they come into the page
[09:54:31] <Patrik2> Okok. So, can I switch "document" for like... The functions name?
[09:54:33] <ajpiano> that's what actual CSS is for :)
[09:54:40] <ajpiano> uh, no
[09:54:54] <Patrik2> ajpiano, haha, okey, sry :(
[09:55:02] <[fields]> http://jsfiddle.net/BAXTC/1/ -  wish this had line numbers.  my loginfrom js var is being written to div just fine.  But: $('#theBody #loginForm #subm').click(function() { alert('test'); });   so I can dynamically create a form, but I'm not sure why I can't validate that form
[09:55:09] <ajpiano> $(document).ready(function() { }); is a way of executing code when the DOM is ready to be manipulated
[09:55:22] <ajpiano> it's not $( readMyMind ).andDoWhatIWant(fn)
[09:55:38] <Patrik2> ajpiano: The CSS attributes are depending on context, that's why I'm using jQuery.
[09:55:51] <ajpiano> huh
[09:55:58] <Patrik2> ajpiano: Hmm, but I might know how to do..
[09:56:04] <ajpiano> Patrik2: you don't have to use JavaScript to inject CSS just because the CSS is context-specific
[09:56:33] <ajpiano> Patrik2: furthermore it is a much better practice to add classes to elements with javascript than call .css() directly
[09:56:46] <Patrik2> Well, I want the "left" attribute to be the elements width
[09:57:03] <ajpiano> ok that's one thing
[09:57:16] <ajpiano> when you have dynamic stuff that you need to measure dynamically, then you can set that on the fly
[09:57:23] <ajpiano> but other things that are static should be encapsulated into a class
[09:57:41] <john_anderson> Folks I have a sortable set that on update calls a function that ajaxly sends a POST, but for some reason the $.ajax hangs really bad. Like 5-6 seconds. Anything I should be careful about regarding sortable events and ajax?
[09:57:45] <ajpiano> and also there still may be ways to position what you want with pure css and not JS but i can't say for certain
[09:58:13] <Patrik2> ajpiano. Okok.. But if I have the name of the function. Can I somehow tell it to if(Function1IsCalled) do this:  ?
[09:58:16] <john_anderson> I have other ajax calls in different places that seem to work fine :/
[09:58:23] <ajpiano> john_anderson: that's not enough information to make a judgment about
[09:59:02] <ajpiano> john_anderson: does it hang up on the client side before the request is made or after
[09:59:18] <john_anderson> it hands on the .ajax call
[09:59:27] <john_anderson> When i profile it or debug it, that call takes 5-6 seconds
[09:59:52] <john_anderson> *hangs
[10:00:36] <ajpiano> so the server takes 5 seconds to respond?
[10:01:02] <john_anderson> no the ui takes 5-6 seconds to run .ajax
[10:01:13] <john_anderson> everything blocks
[10:01:26] <ajpiano> are you using async: false
[10:01:30] <john_anderson> nope
[10:01:59] <ajpiano> john_anderson: so you must be doing some sort of intense processing on the client side to prepare the data that gets sent over ajax?
[10:02:14] <john_anderson> I don't think so
[10:02:22] <john_anderson> I can set a break point before the ajax call is made
[10:02:29] <john_anderson> and each step takes very little time
[10:02:33] <ajpiano> you should probably show some code at this point
[10:02:35] <john_anderson> then I hit jQuery.ajax()
[10:02:39] <john_anderson> and it takes forever
[10:02:58] <ajpiano> cause this isn't alchemy, it's not like you magically mix sortable events with ajax and ajax gets slower
[10:03:46] <ajpiano> ?cik
[10:03:46] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[10:04:07] <john_anderson> ajpiano: I totally agree, but I can't track this issue down :/
[10:04:20] <john_anderson> ajpiano: http://pastium.org/view/2a15cc2d6172d52791a2ac10c135f92f
[10:04:27] <RohanBhangui> ajpiano: where do oyu ge tthe full list of commands for using the bot?
[10:04:57] <ajpiano> RohanBhangui: the full list isn't really anywhere
[10:05:07] <ajpiano> what you do is join the channel 4 years ago before the bot exists and slowly memorise them all
[10:05:09] <ajpiano> :p
[10:05:13] <ajpiano> we are working on a replacement bot :p
[10:05:16] <trumpetmic> what's the best way to display part of an external website inside your web page?
[10:05:19] <RohanBhangui> lol
[10:05:28] <RohanBhangui> ya you should really consider indexing all ocmamnds
[10:05:31] <RohanBhangui> and putting it somewhere?
[10:05:55] <RohanBhangui> trumpetmic: using iframe?
[10:06:02] <RohanBhangui> if you style it properly
[10:06:09] <john_anderson> trumpetmic: or web services :)
[10:06:18] <ajpiano> john_anderson: mymoney is on the loop that is preparing the data
[10:06:40] <john_anderson> those operations take milliseconds when I go step by step in the debugger
[10:07:07] <ajpiano> can you profile the code
[10:07:20] <ajpiano> and see what functions the time is being spent inside of
[10:07:45] <ajpiano> john_anderson: how big does that orders array end up being
[10:07:59] <john_anderson> ajpiano: 3 while I'm testing right now
[10:08:03] <ajpiano> hum
[10:08:04] <RohanBhangui> trumpetmic: use iframes its from old html but it works
[10:08:38] <john_anderson> ajpiano: eh I'm using minified so it's not too helpful
[10:08:47] <ajpiano> john_anderson: too bad it's impossible to change that
[10:09:01] <ajpiano> :p
[10:09:14] <john_anderson> ajpiano: change what?
[10:09:32] <ajpiano> whether or not you're using the minified version when developing :p
[10:09:40] <RohanBhangui> lol
[10:09:43] <john_anderson> heh
[10:10:00] <john_anderson> 58% self cost on f.extend.param.e
[10:10:22] <john_anderson> 26% on (program)
[10:10:31] <john_anderson> 10% on send
[10:10:39] <john_anderson> rest are negligible
[10:10:44] <john_anderson> (< 2%)
[10:11:22] <ajpiano> john_anderson: so it seems like it's getting gummed up serializing the data
[10:11:33] <ajpiano> what does that data structure look like?
[10:11:53] <john_anderson> just an array of ints
[10:11:59] <john_anderson> lemme take it out
[10:14:15] <john_anderson> ajpiano: yeah that's it
[10:14:24] <john_anderson> the data was a bit different than I expected
[10:14:45] <ajpiano> john_anderson: yea... data is pretty much expected to be key value pairs
[10:14:50] <ajpiano> not an array
[10:15:30] <john_anderson> key value pairs in what format?
[10:15:43] <ajpiano> a javascript object
[10:15:47] <ajpiano> {foo: bar}
[10:15:57] <ajpiano> john_anderson: that's why i'd recommend if you have some complex data structure
[10:16:07] <john_anderson> hm - I was doing object[foo] = bar
[10:16:11] <ajpiano> just doing data: {foo: JSON.stringify( structure )}
[10:16:29] <john_anderson> yeah it's not and shouldn't be - I just need a list
[10:16:34] <ajpiano> and then decoding the json on the serverside
[10:16:48] <john_anderson> ajpiano: thanks a ton for the help - what pointed you toward the serialization?
[10:16:49] <ajpiano> john_anderson: are you using an array when you actually want an object :p
[10:16:54] <john_anderson> roger that
[10:17:08] <ajpiano> john_anderson: i think you want var orders = {};
[10:17:19] <ajpiano> john_anderson: the fact that it was spending 58% of the time there :p
[10:17:39] <john_anderson> I guess I just don't understand what f.extend.param.e is :)
[10:17:44] <ajpiano> oh
[10:17:55] <RohanBhangui> ajpiano: initMouseEvent is javascript NOT jquery right?
[10:17:57] <ajpiano> see ?jQuery.param
[10:17:58] <bot-t> jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[10:18:18] <ajpiano> john_anderson: jQuery.param is what jquery uses in ajax for translating the data into strings for sending over ajax :)
[10:18:25] <john_anderson> got it
[10:18:29] <john_anderson> ajpiano: thanks again
[10:18:32] <john_anderson> :)
[10:18:36] <ajpiano> RohanBhangui: to be perfectly technical, it's the DOM API
[10:18:42] <ajpiano> not part of JavaScript The Language
[10:18:45] <ajpiano> but it's not jquery either
[10:18:50] <RohanBhangui> okay
[10:18:54] <RohanBhangui> but it nis ajvascript
[10:19:02] <RohanBhangui> *it is javascript
[10:19:08] <ajpiano> it nis ajvascript indeed
[10:19:56] <RohanBhangui> lol
[10:26:24] <sigger> seems like this channel could need a "Buy ajpiano a pint" possibilty ;)
[10:27:06] <ajpiano> sigger: one guy tried twice to send me local abbey brewed ale from france, but it got rejected by customs both times :(
[10:28:36] <sigger> Rejected or "disappeared"? ;)
[10:28:47] <devkinetic> im having a silly issue, I've followed syntax to the t checked my json for formatting etc but noting is returned. http://jsfiddle.net/zLpd7/ any ideas?
[10:29:42] <ajpiano> sigger: by customs, apparently :(
[10:31:26] <sigger> too bad. But your knowledge to js and jquery is impressive. I'am currently reading into Mutation Events. But it seems they are not ready to use for productive. But nice topic though
[10:31:34] <asher^> devkinetic you are using getjson to get something that isnt json
[10:32:07] <asher^> which the console would have told you :)
[10:32:55] <devkinetic> asher^: how is the data not json? i formatted it as json and sent json headers. the console shows no error. i can see the contents of the remote file in the net panel
[10:33:23] <asher^> Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html
[10:33:46] <asher^> also, the contents are nothing like json
[10:37:27] <devkinetic> asher^: you are correct about the mime, im setting it in the code, but it doesn't seem to be applying... thank you!
[10:37:46] <rabbi1> how can i get the actual content of [object object] ?
[10:38:17] <asher^> devkinetic its not just the mime type, its the content also
[10:38:41] * tw2113 acts like a mime trapped in a box
[10:38:42] <asher^> rabbi1, show some code in jsfiddle :)
[10:38:58] <asher^> if a mime falls over in the forest, does he make a sound?
[10:40:24] <devkinetic> asher^: how is the data printed not json? it is a php array passed through json_encode(). aare you catching something im not?
[10:42:05] * Whirl3d_ acts like tw2113's mirror
[10:42:26] <asher^> devkinetic its different now since the last time i loaded it
[10:42:37] * tw2113 makes Whirl3d_ look good
[10:43:06] <asher^> previously it showed (\u003cdiv class...
[10:43:51] <asher^> youll also need to specify in your code that you want the 'data'
[10:45:21] <Cryp71c> if I do $('#selector').children().on('mouseout', ....);
[10:45:42] <Cryp71c> Is the mouseout event applied only to immediate children of #selector or is it applied to everything contained within #selector) ?
[10:46:33] <asher^> Cryp71c have you tried to find out?
[10:47:03] <Cryp71c> asher^, well, yeah...sort of, I've come here specifically asking because the problem I'm experiencing implies that it is applied to everything contained
[10:47:26] <asher^> well then show us the jsfiddle :)
[10:47:48] <Cryp71c> asher^, http://jsfiddle.net/XgLcY/
[10:48:21] <Cryp71c> TBH I'm not sure that fiddle is 100% correct, because it behaves slightly different than the implementation on a website in question, but the fundamental problem is the same
[10:49:05] <Cryp71c> mouseover "channel partner" to bring up the "dashboard" box. Go down into the dashboard box and over the "dashboard" text, then SLIGHTLY outside the "dashboard" text and the whole div disappears, even though you're still within the div that has the mouseout event tied to it.
[10:50:59] <asher^> Cryp71c can i ask why you are not giving the element you want this functionality on its own id?
[10:52:07] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: support needed, if you not busy
[10:52:54] <asher^> Cryp71c it is unexpected behaviour, but what you are doing seems kind of strange also
[10:53:15] <asher^> its not regular ui to have tooltips require a mouseover before they can dissapear
[10:53:17] <Whirl3d_> swamped my friend, but what's up?
[10:53:33] <Cryp71c> asher^, here: http://jsfiddle.net/XgLcY/2/
[10:53:49] <Cryp71c> I've given the element its own id, but the functionality still exists.
[10:54:01] <Cryp71c> Essentially, although it doesn't look like it now, this is intended to be a navigation pane.
[10:54:06] <jfisk1987> hey guys
[10:54:25] <Cryp71c> asher^, Its just really...lacking, atm...which is why you probably think it is a tooltip
[10:54:44] <jfisk1987> newb question, how could i access the css properties of a particular div class?
[10:54:53] <asher^> Cryp71c if you remove all the stuff before the hide it works, except that it dissapears when you go over the child
[10:55:02] <asher^> so some of the js before that is messing with it
[10:55:20] <Cryp71c> asher^, the js before is what keeps it from hiding when you go over the "dashboard" div
[10:55:33] <Cryp71c> This is necessary because of the way javascript events are bubbling up.
[10:56:08] <Cryp71c> Effectively, when you enter the child (named "child") of a div (named "parent") the onmouseout event is fired for "parent"
[10:56:09] <tw2113> rabbi1 [12:38pm] <asher^> rabbi1, show some code in jsfiddle :)
[10:56:32] <tw2113> about 18 minutes ago
[10:56:51] <rabbi1> tw2113: sure, doing it
[10:57:43] <Chel> question: is there a way to write client javascript jquery code with ttd approach  /
[10:57:52] <Chel> /\//?
[11:00:39] <asher^> Cryp71c have you noticed the errors in console btw?
[11:01:13] <Cryp71c> asher^, yeah its because the script is not iframe safe (essentially, the while loop is "bubbling" out until it gets to "body" but it hits the outer edge of the iframe "document" first)
[11:01:26] <asher^> the nodeName errors?
[11:04:43] <cusco> hi
[11:05:00] <cusco> I'm using .keyup(), and I would like to filter only for ascii values
[11:05:42] <cusco> (its for a search box, and I don't want to trigger in case he presses other keys that are not A..Z, a..z, 0..9
[11:07:17] <asher^> you are after alphanumeric rather than ascii then ;)
[11:07:32] <asher^> have you looked at the html5 pattern attribute?
[11:08:00] <asher^> pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+" as an input attribute
[11:08:02] <RPkS> Having a hell of a time getting a jcarousel image scroller to behave right in IE 8 & 9 ...it works perfectly in IE 7 oddly enough. Can I get some eyes to take a look in IE 8 or 9 and see what might be the culprit?   http://hiddencameragear.com/cellphone-recon-usb-surveillance-tool
[11:14:39] <RPkS> I should mention that the thumbnails are being pulled in using fancybox (which is the default image display for opencart)
[11:15:43] <RPkS> The site displays perfectly in every browser I've tried it in except IE 8 & 9
[11:22:03] <devkinetic> I'm still not retieving any data from my json callback, syntax is correct, data is formatted as json, and json headers set. http://jsfiddle.net/CGLhE/ asher^ : i made the fixes you suggested and still a no-go...
[11:28:35] <Whirl3d_> devkinetic, try this? :http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CGLhE/1/
[11:30:11] <Whirl3d_> I get a result when I manually enter the url...
[11:31:07] <Whirl3d_> if you change jquery version to 1.7 you get an error at least
[11:31:53] <Whirl3d_> which shows statusText="success" and readystate 4
[11:31:56] <Whirl3d_> lol
[11:32:48] <imsky> i come in Ps
[11:33:39] <devkinetic> Whirl3d_: yeah its a wierd one. Im looking at how im implimenting the callback page, i belive the error lies there....
[11:33:43] <Whirl3d_> devkinetic, if you take the ? off the end fo the secondary, you get SOP error
[11:33:49] <asher^> its confusing me
[11:34:10] <asher^> also, why the parens around the json?
[11:34:16] <imsky> lol
[11:34:28] <imsky> reed moar
[11:35:04] <Whirl3d_> asher^, to whom are you speaking?
[11:35:13] <asher^> devkinetic
[11:36:30] <hph> so, I imported blockUI plugin and called it in an inline script, but it still won't work. Am i missing anything?
[11:36:58] <hph> i have an up-to-date version of jQuery
[11:37:00] <aftab> Hello how do I get the index number of the <script> element which has loaded the javascript source on a page ? i tried jQuery(this).index() but it deosn't work
[11:37:15] <devkinetic> asher^: if the parens are removed i recieve a type error in firebug. the parens are required becuase of the callback=?
[11:37:28] <ajpiano> aftab: scripts have no knowledge of their position in the dom
[11:37:39] <Whirl3d_> aren't you going to get the SOP error?
[11:38:21] <asher^> could the problem be that it has a cross site origin?
[11:38:27] <aftab> ajpiano: oh so is there a way to add the unique id to the script as soon as it loads so when the data comes It can be targeted easily ?
[11:39:29] <Whirl3d_> and if you are supplying a callback function, doesn't it have to be jsonp?
[11:39:31] <Scapegoat17_> hello, does anyone have any ideas as to why my javascript does not seem to be firing in their modals?
[11:39:40] <Whirl3d_> nope
[11:39:51] <Whirl3d_> do you know why my car isn't running?
[11:40:05] <Scapegoat17_> yup. you are not in your car
[11:40:14] <Whirl3d_> show us some script and we can prolly help you
[11:40:24] <Whirl3d_> Aha! I have no car...close...
[11:40:30] <Scapegoat17_> darn!
[11:40:42] <Scapegoat17_> let me gather up some code and i will be back
[11:40:45] <Whirl3d_> lemme guess about your problem:   not loaded in document ready wrapper
[11:40:52] <Whirl3d_> post to jsfiddle, please
[11:40:54] <Scapegoat17_> nah it is
[11:41:06] <Whirl3d_> shucks.   8)
[11:41:29] <ajpiano> aftab: i mean, you can put an ID attribute on the script
[11:41:32] <ajpiano> so it can query for itself
[11:41:36] <ajpiano> like any other dom element
[11:41:55] <hph> can anyone tell me how to set up blockUI so that it will fire whenever a link is clicked?
[11:41:57] <aftab> ajpiano: i need to do it dynamically because the script tags have already been placed on lots of websites and I can't change them all
[11:42:18] <ajpiano> so then it's fair to say you're up shit's creek w/o a paddle
[11:42:25] <imsky> damn adam
[11:42:28] <imsky> leave some room for me
[11:42:37] <ajpiano> lol
[11:42:40] * imsky resident trolls
[11:42:44] <asher^> hehe
[11:43:28] <ajpiano> aftab: is this like, a 3rd party script kinda thing
[11:43:44] <devkinetic> asher^: no, that is acually the reason im using jsonp as it allows cross domain 'ajax'.
[11:44:14] <ajpiano> aftab: you could theoretically iterate through the document's scripts and find the one whose url matches like, your app/the script you're looking for
[11:45:08] <Whirl3d_> devkinetic, you have to have a callback function declared for the jsonp results, don't you?
[11:46:29] <Scapegoat17_> whirl3d: let me know how this works out for you http://jsfiddle.net/7mBvR/
[11:47:23] <hph> what's the easiest way to reference the whole page in the DOM?
[11:48:26] <grumpyOldRussian> HTML
[11:50:09] <ajpiano> aftab: if you go to http://jsbin.com and run this code
[11:50:10] <ajpiano> var mine = $("script").filter(function() { return this.src.indexOf("jsbin.js") > -1; }), index = mine.index("script"); index;
[11:50:15] <ajpiano> you will see that it can kinda work
[11:50:26] <Whirl3d_> Scapegoat17, I'd like to say you were close...but your missing some key ideas in the fiddle. First only your body content goes in the html panel. Anything you need to load (extra libraries and all) go under "addResources."
[11:50:30] <ajpiano> assuming the script knows enough about its own filename
[11:50:46] <Whirl3d_> Then your scripts don't need to be wrapped in html <script> tags either...
[11:50:53] <ajpiano> hph: document.documentElement
[11:51:14] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7mBvR/2/ is closer but obviously not right...
[11:52:53] <Whirl3d_> and Scapegoat17_, youdon't need to use document.getElementById when you have jquery loaded. You can just use: $("#id") for example.
[11:53:22] <Whirl3d_> but even then, you don't have any id's numbered "div1" or "div2" so you can't select them.
[11:55:03] <BLeg> Can anyone tell me if there's a way to access properties of a registered event with the on() method? So for example I'm doing $(sel).on('DOMAttrModified', function() {…….}), where DOMAttrModified is supposed to expose some properties… how do I get at them?
[11:55:53] <ajpiano> BLeg: the same way you do with every event... $("foo").on("bar", function(event) { event.watever; });
[11:56:32] <ajpiano> BLeg: but dom mutation events are not like, a good idea
[11:57:00] <ajpiano> http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/05/dom-mutationobserver-reacting-to-dom-changes-without-killing-browser-performance/
[11:57:10] <NoiseEee> BLeg: http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/dom/as/complete/
[11:57:14] <BLeg> That makes sense… I know they're not, but it's a simple GreaseMonkey script that will never see the light of day
[11:57:16] <NoiseEee> herp
[11:57:27] <Scapegoat17_> okay. well that was the code from the master page, i do have ids, but they are on the other page. I guess it would have been somewhat helpful to include that but i did not think that it was needed since that is not where i am having the issue
[11:57:44] <BLeg> and I don't have access to the code that's firing that event or I would (obviously) handle it there
[11:57:45] <decalpha> hi
[11:57:52] <ajpiano> BLeg: then go to town :)
[11:58:00] <BLeg> Way ahead of you ;)
[11:58:05] <decalpha> how come whenever i disable my checkboxes using jquery wehn i read the value its always true
[11:58:07] <ajpiano> BLeg: the jQuery wrapped event is passed in as the first argument to all event handler funtions
[11:58:10] <decalpha> no matter if it is checked or not
[11:58:19] <ajpiano> BLeg: and the original unwrapped browser event is availalbe at event.originalEvent
[11:58:21] <ajpiano> fyi :)
[11:58:27] <decalpha> this doesnt happen when the checkbox is not disabled
[11:58:34] <decalpha> does anyone know bout this bug?
[11:58:50] <BLeg> ajpiano: Perfect… I come from the .NET world where it works the same… still learning js
[11:58:55] <ajpiano> decalpha: because the value of the checkbox doesn't change regardless of whether it's checked
[11:59:34] <decalpha> how come whenever i disable my checkboxes using jquery wehn i read the value its always true
[11:59:37] <ajpiano> ?checkboxes @ decalpha
[11:59:38] <bot-t> decalpha, As of jQuery 1.6, use .prop("checked") to test checked, and .prop("checked", true or false) to change the state. In jQuery 1.5 you could check the box with .attr("checked","checked") and to uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked")
[11:59:48] <decalpha> even thought its not checked
[11:59:50] <ajpiano> because the value of the checkbox doesn't change regardless of whether its disabled, either
[12:00:12] <ajpiano> decalpha: stop trying to read the value if what you actually want to do is find out if it's checked :)
[12:02:27] <decalpha> nayone?
[12:02:58] <ajpiano> decalpha: because the value attribute of a checkbox has nothing to do with whether or not it's checked or disabled
[12:03:10] <ajpiano> it's just whatever is in the value="whatever" in the element
[12:03:16] <[fields]> decalpha:  test for checked, not for its value
[12:05:59] <RudwolfBlack> Could someone tell me if there is a tutorial or plugin to do this effect : http://www.daypilot.org/demo/Scheduler/Default.aspx (when we scoll HORIZONTALLY on the calendar it loads the other parts to the foward or to the back of it...)
[12:08:07] <RudwolfBlack> someone able to gimme just a hint at least? please? pretty please? :(
[12:12:03] <Salt> is there any way to get plugin files while the site is down?
[12:12:24] <decalpha> hello
[12:12:42] <decalpha> how come a disabled checkbox when i read it on the server it is always on
[12:12:47] <decalpha> no matter if it is checked or not
[12:12:49] <decalpha> help me
[12:13:40] <decalpha> how come a disabled checkbox when i read it on the server it is always on
[12:14:06] <RudwolfBlack> Salt: depends... if you blocked access to the files, no, if you just putted the site under manteinance and the files still there, maybe
[12:14:43] <Salt> RudwolfBlack: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jFlick
[12:15:12] <RudwolfBlack> not down for me here
[12:15:35] <Salt> try actually getting the file
[12:15:44] <RudwolfBlack> oh wait... yes
[12:15:46] <RudwolfBlack> =/
[12:15:58] <RudwolfBlack> in case the file was REMOVED.. not the site itself
[12:16:13] <RudwolfBlack> did you tried googling for its file name?
[12:16:23] <Salt> yeap
[12:16:46] <Salt> and the plugin author's site has no leads
[12:17:35] <relipse> i am using jquery auto-complete, how do I close the autocomplete box (i'm hiding the surrounding div, and when reshowing the div, the autocomplete is still there)
[12:19:23] <track0x1> how can i make it so each filter option is controlled individually as opposed to all http://jsfiddle.net/TKEvX/1/
[12:19:51] <Cryp71c> for jquery's .on (http://api.jquery.com/on/) does ommiting [selector] object cause the event to fire on all descendants, or none? The text on the jquery page doesn't seem very clear to me.
[12:20:27] <NoiseEee> Cryp71c: all
[12:21:00] <Cryp71c> NoiseEee, is an empty selector sufficient to have it fire for no descendants?
[12:21:32] <NoiseEee> er then whats the point
[12:22:11] <track0x1> is there a way to do something like $('this:parent li:not(.select)').slideUp();
[12:22:23] <Cryp71c> NoiseEee, to have the event fire on only the event you apply it (so, prevent bubbling)
[12:22:28] <darkfrog> when I use jquery commands why do I never see any errors in the console with Firebug?
[12:24:09] <NoiseEee> Cryp71c: its the way JS works, sorry.
[12:24:29] <Cryp71c> NoiseEee, yeah :( essentially, I want mouseleave to work for all browsers
[12:27:50] <Whirl3d_> any preferences out there for a stylish toolltip plugin?
[12:29:54] <hph> is there an alternate to jQuery.noConflict() that doesn't require you to change the $'s to
[12:30:03] <hph> "jQuery" everywehere?
[12:30:16] <darkfrog> how do I make jQuery output to the console in Firebug when there's an error?
[12:30:53] <hph> because I think that would mess up the app I'm working on beyond repair, but I'm getting the "$(document).ready is not a function" error
[12:31:11] <silverwind> hph, wrap your code in a closure
[12:31:24] <silverwind> (function($) {  yourcodehere })(jQuery);
[12:31:31] <hph> ah, thanks.
[12:34:29] <ryanneufeld> haha, pinterest uses jquery/jqueryui
[12:34:44] <track0x1> anyone have an idea of how to do such?
[12:35:03] <snover> ryanneufeld: why is that funny or noteworthy?
[12:36:37] <ryanneufeld> snover: it's a pretty popular website
[12:36:50] <snover> again
[12:37:10] <track0x1> is there a way in jquery to use $(this li)
[12:37:12] <track0x1> or something similar?
[12:37:28] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: what are you trying to accomplish
[12:37:34] <ryanneufeld> snover: w/e man, you're so negative
[12:37:43] <snover> ryanneufeld: nope
[12:38:11] <track0x1> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/TKEvX/1/ essentially i need to select the filter that has been clicked, not every filter.
[12:38:55] <track0x1> so if i could do something like $('this:parent li:not(.select)').slideUp() would be ideal
[12:39:28] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: $(this).find('li').first() might work for you
[12:39:40] <ryanneufeld> or $('li', this)
[12:39:53] <ryanneufeld> the second one will find li's in the context of this
[12:39:59] <cgardner1> I have a rogue event somewhere.  Is there any way to determine where it's being set?
[12:40:02] <ryanneufeld> not sure if one is faster
[12:41:04] <ryanneufeld> cgardner1: what do you mean by rough event
[12:41:04] <track0x1> hmm let me try
[12:41:15] <devkinetic> asher^: Whirl3d_ : the solution to my issue was my json needed to be prepended with my callback from the url Response.Write(QueryValues.Get("callback") + GetHttpRequest(url)); sources here http://jqueryninja.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/calling-a-net-service-from-jquery/
[12:41:54] <cgardner1> ryanneufeld:  I mean it's firing on an element it shouldn't.
[12:42:18] <track0x1> hmm... ryanneufeld is there a way to do this:parent?
[12:42:20] <ryanneufeld> cgardner1: is it firing on the parent of the element? or a child of the element that should?
[12:42:27] <track0x1> ryanneufeld: something like         $('li:not(.select)', this:parent).slideUp();
[12:42:29] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: $(this).parent()
[12:42:42] <cgardner> ryanneufeld:  neither.  A completely separate element.
[12:42:48] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: you can pass a selector as the second param
[12:42:56] <ryanneufeld> cgardner: code?
[12:47:25] <louism2__> Hey all, I am getting some weird params when I try to make a getscript call using jquery.  Anyone have idea if there is some data getting sent with that request that I am not aware of? https://gist.github.com/3100402
[12:47:55] <ryanneufeld> louism2__: the _ is a cachebuster
[12:48:08] <ryanneufeld> louism2__: see ?ajax
[12:48:10] <bot-t> louism2__, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:49:13] <louism2__> ryanneufeld: ahhhhh, thanks for that
[12:49:26] <louism2__> could that be messing with the id param making it undefined?
[12:49:35] <ryanneufeld> louism2__: yeah, you can safely ignore it on your server send
[12:49:38] <ryanneufeld> *end
[12:50:13] <ryanneufeld> louism2__: remove the spaces between your html attr
[12:52:42] <track0x1> grrr
[12:52:44] <track0x1> i can't get this to work.
[12:53:20] <track0x1> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/TKEvX/4/ that won't select the li's for some reason
[12:53:59] <track0x1> i guess because the li is not a direct child of the main div.... so how do i select something like ul > li
[12:54:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah,
[12:54:37] <louism2__> ryanneufeld: thanks, I appreciate the help
[12:54:48] <ryanneufeld> louism2__: np
[12:55:58] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: http://jsfiddle.net/TKEvX/5/
[12:56:00] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: FIFY
[12:56:40] <track0x1> AH that is perfect! i just added the :not that i had and its A+
[12:56:45] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[12:56:49] <track0x1> thanks ryanneufeld
[12:56:54] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: np
[12:57:01] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: checkout the jquery UI stuff
[12:57:07] <track0x1> i'm taking a look
[12:57:09] <matthewk> i saw someone pasted http://pastebin.com/9izw3LGy , and i'm having the same problem. can someone please help?
[12:57:22] <track0x1> oh wow i think i might just use that!
[12:57:42] <ryanneufeld> track0x1: :)
[12:58:01] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: that pastebin doesn't really ask a question
[12:58:16] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: and it's loading an oooold verison of jquery
[12:58:30] <matthewk> oh ok, i will pastebin my code. one second
[12:59:57] <matthewk> http://pastebin.com/pBzg3geM
[13:01:03] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: that's a link to my current piece of code. it's using the 1.5.1
[13:01:39] <matthewk> probably 1.7.2 works also, but i tested the code with 1.5.1 before making it into a widget
[13:01:52] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: I'm not familiar with that pattern
[13:02:02] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: can you explain what it's doing?
[13:02:21] <matthewk> pattern ?
[13:03:04] <matthewk> the skeleton for the 'checking if jquery is loaded' is from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2170439/how-to-embed-javascript-widget-that-depends-on-jquery-into-an-unknown-environmen
[13:03:40] <matthewk> the body of })(window, document, "1.5.1", function($, jquery_loaded) { // is where i have my widget code
[13:03:58] <ryanneufeld> okay..
[13:04:09] <matthewk> i can paste the errors here or i noted the kooshad.com/crf.php where it is being tested
[13:04:28] <ryanneufeld> note the || callback(j, loaded)
[13:04:42] <ryanneufeld> and that your callback doesn't return anything
[13:04:44] <matthewk> using firebug to see the errors. Jquery seems loaded, b/c the console.log($('#slides')); is executing fine
[13:05:13] <ryanneufeld> yes
[13:05:53] <matthewk> http://sponsor.christianrelieffund.org/storecrf/widget.php has the same onload code to show this library is functioning
[13:06:09] <ryanneufeld> oh, so it's loading jquery, calling no conflict
[13:06:19] <ryanneufeld> and then returning that value to your widget
[13:07:43] <ryanneufeld> where does the slides function come from?
[13:08:30] <Salvager> how can make jquery work on elements that i load with ajax ??
[13:08:47] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: it already does
[13:09:00] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: where does slides() come from?
[13:09:24] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: line 33: http://sponsor.christianrelieffund.org/storecrf/widget/slides.jquery.js
[13:09:56] <ryanneufeld> That file isn't loaded on the example page you sent me
[13:09:59] <matthewk> http://sponsor.christianrelieffund.org/storecrf/widget.php it's also being used here. (which is not testing the widget, but testing the slides class).
[13:10:14] <ryanneufeld> OH
[13:10:19] <ryanneufeld> why are you loading it that way?
[13:10:30] <Salvager> I load some html elements with ajax, but this http://pastebin.com/hAnkh7Jf dosent work on them
[13:10:31] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: in my firebug, it shows that it is loaded for me.
[13:10:44] <ryanneufeld> right, so here's the problem
[13:10:52] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: sorry, is there a better way to load it? i need to insure it is loaded before calling the slides() of course :)
[13:10:53] <Salvager> but it works on elements 100% the same, which aint loaded with ajax
[13:11:25] <ryanneufeld> that plugin is probably looking for $, which isn't in the global scope
[13:11:44] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: i think you're right, but i don't know how to correct it :\
[13:11:49] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: so what that wrapper you're using is doing is making a sandboxed version of jquery for you to play with
[13:12:10] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: asside from rewriting the plugin, I dunno either
[13:12:40] <ryanneufeld> I'm not that familiar withe technique
[13:12:41] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: how can i give access from the sandboxes ver of jquery to class which is being imported ?
[13:13:05] <matthewk> ( give reference to the $ )
[13:13:16] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: not sure, I don't personally do it that way
[13:13:31] <ryanneufeld> looks like you're writing your code to be added to any page
[13:13:39] <matthewk> can you give me an example skeleton for me to use for a widget ?
[13:13:46] <ryanneufeld> no, I don't have one
[13:13:47] <matthewk> ryanneufeld: yes
[13:13:55] <Gho5t> what are you guys using for a free wysiwyg?
[13:14:12] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: for user input, or editing my code?
[13:14:13] <Salvager> anyone?
[13:14:22] <Gho5t> ryanneufeld: user input
[13:14:23] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: your question doesn't make any sense
[13:14:24] <tw2113> who uses wysiwyg's?
[13:14:30] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: I don't use any
[13:14:40] <matthewk> anyone here experience with developing a widget ?
[13:14:49] <Gho5t> you don't give your users a way to enter html?
[13:14:58] <ryanneufeld> matthewk: I was gonna suggest you look at using an iframe
[13:15:26] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: no.
[13:15:42] <Gho5t> I kinda need one
[13:15:44] <Gho5t> it's a cms
[13:15:44] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: our user input doesn't need it. I've used tinymce, it's the best of the worst
[13:15:53] <Gho5t> yeah it's garbage
[13:15:57] <Gho5t> i used to use fckeditor
[13:16:07] <Gho5t> but since it's been 5 years i figured something better has come along
[13:16:11] <Gho5t> but who knows
[13:16:14] <ryanneufeld> tinymce is the best I found
[13:16:23] <Gho5t> ok
[13:16:27] <ryanneufeld> it's a bit of a cludge, but they do have callbacks
[13:16:40] <ryanneufeld> their docs suck, but googling and some persistence
[13:16:40] <ajpiano> Gho5t: CKEditor is pretty good
[13:16:54] <ajpiano> it's the sequel to fckeditor :p
[13:16:56] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano knows his shit, you might like that
[13:16:56] <Gho5t> ajpiano: as opposed to fckeditor?
[13:16:59] <Gho5t> oh haha
[13:17:02] <ajpiano> yeah, it's what superseded it
[13:17:12] <Gho5t> ok that might be what i'm looking for then
[13:17:26] <ryanneufeld> I found it to be limited for my use case, which is probably why I chose tiny
[13:17:38] <ryanneufeld> but check em out, find the one that does what you need. :)
[13:17:40] <Gho5t> here's another one http://jhtmlarea.codeplex.com/
[13:20:07] <Salvager> This dosent work, hope it makes more sense now. http://pastebin.com/dt4kwYn3
[13:20:27] <Salvager> can someone tell me how i can get it to work?
[13:21:25] <track0x1> if you need to make a group of elements easily selectable... is the best route to take just to add some kind of class to that element that should be a part of the group and deal with it like that? or is there a better option?
[13:35:12] <Salvager> think i need to use .live() or .on() anyone know if that is right?
[13:36:51] <nlogax> Salvager: Yeah, if you are inserting new elements later, the code in your paste won't see them, but live() will
[13:37:23] <Salvager> yeah seems like it, though jquery's documentation state that live() is deprecated
[13:37:48] <jSlack> supposed to use on()
[13:37:56] <jSlack> but i'm personally still using live() since on() has never worked properly for me.
[13:38:29] <tamarche> I just use bind() =p
[13:38:33] <danzik17> jSlack: .live just calls.on with a different argument order.  you can do the same thing with $( document ).on( "click", "someselector", fn )
[13:38:58] <Salvager> yeah, so i just use on('click', function) instead of click(function(). am i right?
[13:39:02] <jSlack> danzik17: Tried that on my JQM pages, but some states failed to load
[13:39:21] <Salvager> so be able to make the click function work on new elements too
[13:39:30] <Salvager> or am I wrong?
[13:39:55] <danzik17> jSlack: alright, but the code disagrees with the idea that one would work where the other doesn't.   https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L963
[13:40:14] <warrenparsons> Salvager: Yes, .on('click', function(){… is correct.
[13:40:23] <jSlack> ya, you are definitely right!  I have a feeling it has to do with my hacked mobile pages.
[13:40:53] <warrenparsons> Salvager: If you want to make it work on elements added to the DOM after it fires, use delegation.
[13:40:55] <Salvager> great thanks. and it wont add any other unwanted functionality? all I want is just to make it work on new html element
[13:41:23] <Salvager> .delegate() ?
[13:41:53] <warrenparsons> Salvager: $('body').on('click', '.myNewElement', function(){…}); Will make elements added after firing pick up the event handler.
[13:41:55] <tamarche> I believe bind, live, and delegate all use .on() in some way
[13:41:57] <Salvager> documentation states one should use .on() instead
[13:42:28] <LeroyJEENNKINNSS> hello. I am LERRROOOOYYYYY JEEENNNNNNKKIIIINNNNSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
[13:42:36] <Salvager> lol
[13:42:39] <tamarche> lmao.
[13:42:45] <Salvager> this aint wow
[13:42:48] <warrenparsons> Salvager: But you're usually better off using an element closer to your new one than body. So if you have a div with a class of "parentDiv" into which you're adding the new element, it would be $('.parentDiv').on('click' '.newElement', function(){…});
[13:43:24] <Salvager> this is the current code http://pastebin.com/dt4kwYn3
[13:44:07] <Salvager> 'newElement' what is that?
[13:44:16] <warrenparsons> Salvager: I'm not seeing anything there that would require delegation.
[13:44:36] <warrenparsons> Salvager: Just an example.
[13:45:15] <Salvager> well all the html in that, is loaded with ajax later
[13:48:30] <warrenparsons> Salvager: $('.parentDiv').on('click', '.ajaxContent', function(){ … }); adds a handler to .parentDiv that watches for clicks anywhere inside .parentDiv, if the click happens on an element with a class of .ajaxContent, it fires, regardless of whether the .ajaxContent element existed when the handler was originally added.
[13:49:06] <warrenparsons> Salvager: Make sense?
[13:49:15] <Salvager> thanks alot man, for that great explanation
[13:49:19] <Salvager> makes alot of sense
[13:49:46] <warrenparsons> Salvager: And in rare cases, you want it to happen anywhere in the body, which is where $('body').on('click', '.ajaxElement'…. comes in.
[13:50:06] <tamarche> That's interesting
[13:50:10] <Salvager> yeah I understand the funciton now :)
[13:50:36] <warrenparsons> Salvager: $('element').on('click', function(){…}); works identically to .click. It's only when you add the second parameter to .on() that delegation comes into play.
[13:50:50] <tamarche> So if I append a new element inside $('.parentDiv'), which has the ajaxContent class, it will still fire?
[13:51:07] <LeroyJEENNKINNSS> LLLLEEEERRROOOOOOYYYYYY's GOTTTTAAAA GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[13:51:07] <tamarche> On click of course
[13:51:09] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I am looking for help with actually some of the styling for a jquery slider plugin. I know its not exactly jquery question, but i tried in CSS and got no answer. USUALLY I never have issues with css but theres something strange happening
[13:51:28] <LindsayMac> Basically I have a UL with a list of two links that make up the previous/next buttons for the slider.
[13:51:32] <tamarche> Is that part of the jQuery UI?
[13:51:32] <warrenparsons> tamarche: Yes, a newly added element with a class of "ajaxContent" will trigger the event.
[13:51:50] <warrenparsons> tamarche: No. It's in jQuery core as of 1.7.
[13:52:07] <LindsayMac> Strangely, no matter what I do, the background will NOT show up. I'm working within someone else's code, so i'm hoping to find a new perspective on this issue
[13:52:17] <tamarche> warrenparsons: Good to know, I've been having to do a .unbind().bind(recalledFunction) type thing lol
[13:52:18] <LindsayMac> here's a link to the demo site http://bscdeveloper.com/medteam/
[13:52:27] <warrenparsons> tamarche: Mind you that ajaxContent was just an example. You can use any selector.
[13:52:53] <tamarche> warrenparsons: of course
[13:53:45] <warrenparsons> tamarche: Yeah, delegation has completely changed how I do things in a lot of ways. It existed prior to 1.7, but the .on/.off model makes things much simpler and more consistent.
[13:53:57] <tw2113> LindsayMac your opacity setting
[13:54:17] <tamarche> warrenparsons: Thanks for insight!
[13:54:23] <warrenparsons> Sure thing.
[13:54:29] <LindsayMac> OH.MY.GOD.
[13:54:33] <tamarche> Hahaha.
[13:54:50] <LindsayMac> WOW.. thats what I get for working in someone else's code and not just doing it myself ;?
[13:55:00] <LindsayMac> i feel like an idiot. tw2113 to the rescue.. like always
[13:55:07] <tw2113> my bad
[13:55:23] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  you might as well have smacked me upside the head with a brick with that one.
[13:55:34] <tw2113> but then i'd make you undead
[13:55:35] <LindsayMac> WTF would they put opacity 0?!
[13:55:46] <tamarche> Maybe they wanted clear.... well everything
[13:55:48] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  you KNOW that being undead is not the end of the world for me
[13:56:02] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  and make the background useless? ha
[13:56:11] <LindsayMac> the background being the actual button image!
[13:56:32] <LindsayMac> I swear they did it to mess with me!! Their demo doesnt have it
[13:56:56] <tw2113> they be trollin'
[13:56:58] <tw2113> they hatin'
[13:57:02] <tamarche> trying to catch u
[13:57:03] <tamarche> ridin
[13:57:06] <LindsayMac> hardcore legit
[13:57:25] <chovy> anyone fmailiar with using zClip?
[14:05:42] <Salvager> in $('.parentDiv').on('click' '.newElement', function(){…}); can the '.parentDiv' be a new element also?
[14:09:55] <NoiseEee> Salvager: you're missing the point there
[14:10:20] <NoiseEee> Salvager: whatever element is the parent of dynamic elements and is not itself a dynamic/removable element... THATS what you place '.on()' on
[14:10:20] <Salvager> it was just me being stupid, I understand it now
[14:10:47] <tamarche> So, that means no it looks
[14:14:29] <Salvager> is it better to just include style="display: none;" in the css html from the start? or to use $(".selector").hide();
[14:15:25] <TomWij> Salvager: If you don't plan on showing the element at the start, why are you including the element in the first place?
[14:15:42] <tamarche> I would think using the $(".selector").hide() methodology if there are multiple elements that you need hidden
[14:15:42] <tw2113> valid point
[14:15:58] <Salvager> allright thanks.
[14:16:03] <NoiseEee> and i would use "display:none" to avoid content displaying before JS runs.
[14:16:08] <tamarche> And weren't done so in the first place
[14:17:10] <tamarche> Also if you call .hide() on an element after bad javascript code, that would cause problems too
[14:17:13] <matthewk> $('ul.pagination').width() is reporting the wrong width i think. any idea why ?
[14:17:33] <Salvager> ok
[14:17:44] * tw2113 wonders if width() includes borders/margins/padding
[14:17:53] <tw2113> oh box models
[14:18:11] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/17/ - why won't the last dropdown "right align" like http://i.imgur.com/RQv0i.png?
[14:19:22] * TomWij wonders why tw2113 is wondering about width without having visited its jQuery documentation page which gives you a nice box model picture.
[14:19:40] <tw2113> :D
[14:24:08] <MistuhKurtz> what's the nice little one-liner to check if an obj/var exists, and if not, assign somthing to it?
[14:24:14] <MistuhKurtz> something like this:
[14:24:16] <MistuhKurtz> window.console || console = { log: function(){} };
[14:24:29] <tamarche> mikkelb: in your css, you have .dropdown ul { ... left: 20px; ... } That seems like it's off setting it
[14:24:35] <MistuhKurtz> except that throws a syntax error and I'm not sure what the right way to write it
[14:24:36] <MistuhKurtz> is
[14:24:57] <tamarche> jquery object?
[14:25:10] <tamarche> $('selector').length != 0
[14:25:14] <tamarche> Is what I usually do
[14:26:08] <mikkelb> tamarche: I don't think so, it still won't right align
[14:26:59] <nFFF> jquery object is actually an array of objects
[14:27:01] <tamarche> mikkelb: I removed that line, and it works for me, just the upper background arrow is not at the right place
[14:27:36] <MistuhKurtz> ah figured it out:
[14:27:37] <MistuhKurtz> console = window.console || { log: function(){} };
[14:27:42] <nFFF> length only works on arrays
[14:27:49] <mikkelb> tamarche: oh yeah that's right!
[14:28:06] <tamarche> nFFF, yes I know...
[14:28:09] <mikkelb> cool man
[14:28:30] <nFFF> tamarche, ok so you'll know it wont work on an obj or var :o
[14:29:20] <mikkelb> tamarche: thank you
[14:30:07] <tamarche> nFFF, I specified jQuery object just in case I wasn't sure what var or obj was being referred as
[14:30:19] <tamarche> Web development is not my primary thing =p
[14:30:38] <tamarche> mikkelb: no problem
[14:33:50] <rogo> how do append an element and all it's children right after the existing instance of it?
[14:33:51] <Ricaz> I need some help. If someone could head over to http://rcz.dk/new/ and tell me why the gradient background doesn't fit the white seperators, I would greatly appreciate it.
[14:34:51] <mikkelb> tamarche: can you spot a quick replacement for that left: 20?
[14:35:08] <tamarche> mikkelb: What do you mean?
[14:35:13] <mikkelb> (i.e. for every dropdown except the last one)
[14:35:19] <nFFF> ?demo @ rogo
[14:35:20] <bot-t> rogo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:35:29] <mikkelb> tamarche: well if you look at the first dropdown you can probably see why my friend put that left in there
[14:35:39] <rogo> sure, give me two seconds +bot-t
[14:36:17] <nFFF> Ricaz, #css
[14:36:42] <Ricaz> nFFF thanks
[14:38:01] <nFFF> rogo, do you mean simply duplicate an element and all its children?
[14:38:16] <rogo> nFFF yeah

[14:54:35] <rickibalboa> I'm having a problem trying to determine the position of an element relative to it's parent element, the element inside isn't position absolute or anything, .offset() and .position() both return 0 values for top: and left:
[14:55:24] <LessSeen> make sure the parent is set to position:relative at least
[14:55:36] <nFFF> yes, and its ?position you want
[14:55:36] <rickibalboa> okay
[14:55:46] <nFFF> offset will be relative to document
[14:55:47] <nFFF> ?offset
[14:55:48] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/

[15:06:48] <relipse> how do i dump a whole object with jquery?
[15:06:54] <relipse> like output the whole thing as a string
[15:07:42] <nFFF> relipse, you can log the object to console
[15:07:54] <nFFF> using console.log(jqueryObject)
[15:10:40] <matthewk> does jquery have a destroy method for element?
[15:10:55] <matthewk> i want to delete an element , not just its children
[15:11:16] <SirCmpwn_> matthewk: do you want to delete the element and its children, or delete the element and move its children
[15:11:44] <matthewk> ah, it seems remove() is what i'm looking for
[15:12:18] <SirCmpwn_> so, I'm using jQuery UI and I have some tabs
[15:12:28] <SirCmpwn_> I want one of the tabs to be un-visitable, and I want it to be a link instead
[15:12:29] <SirCmpwn_> halp?
[15:12:40] <SirCmpwn_> I also need to have an event handler for when it's clicked
[15:13:10] <bradmaxs> I need to reset a form: $('.directions_form').on('submit', '#itinerary', function (event) {$('#itinerary').reset();} but I am getting an error - not sure how to reference the form.
[15:14:09] <matthewk> is there another approach to getting the width of an element? i'm using $('ul.pagination').width($('ul.pagination').width()); and, it's setting the width to the width that its container has instead.......
[15:14:23] <matthewk> the width of the ul.pagination is actually much smaller.....
[15:15:28] <nFFF> matthewk look at your code again
[15:15:41] <nFFF> its not actually doing anything
[15:15:50] <nFFF> your setting its width to.... its own width
[15:15:57] <nFFF> inception
[15:16:42] <matthewk> hah.. the width needs to be set b/c i will use margin 0 auto to center it
[15:17:02] <nFFF> that means nothing
[15:17:07] <nFFF> look at your code
[15:17:20] <shaundude> Hey, I'm a query n00b, and I was wondering: how do I set all of my SVGs to use a particular CSS file?  thx
[15:17:29] <nFFF> your setting the objects width, to the width of the same object
[15:17:32] <nFFF> so whats the point
[15:17:34] <nFFF> ?
[15:17:41] <matthewk> nFFF: how can i get the pixels in width that it takes up on the screen? (that's my goal)
[15:18:19] <matthewk> i thought the jquery .width() would determine the above mentioned value i want to determine and then set for the css
[15:18:47] <nFFF> $('ul.pagination').width(); will return the width of the element
[15:18:50] <bradmaxs> anyone know how to reset the form #itinerary within $('.directions_form').on('submit', 'irc://irc.freenode.net/#itinerary', function (event) {}
[15:19:20] <bradmaxs> oops$('.directions_form').on('submit', 'irc://irc.freenode.net/#itinerary', function (event) {}
[15:19:32] <nFFF> which will already be defined by the CSS
[15:19:48] <nFFF> gl bedtime
[15:19:49] <matthewk> nFFF: the css is not defining any width currently :)
[15:19:56] <matthewk> nFFF: thanks
[15:20:00] <bradmaxs> don't know why the irc business is popping up there :)
[15:20:01] <matthewk> gn
[15:20:19] <e-dard> slightly random question. Can anyone recommend something like theme forest, but for really high-end quality designs?
[15:20:48] <tw2113> find a high-end quality designer and get something custom
[15:21:55] <e-dard> tw2113: not quite what i asked :)
[15:23:52] <tw2113> but it has the perk of being a unique design that no one else has
[15:24:03] <tw2113> otherwise, oh yeah
[15:24:07] <tw2113> my bad
[15:24:15] <SirCmpwn_> anyone for turning a jquery ui tab into a regular old link?
[15:35:06] <Snerf_> in using .resizable() with a -webkit-transform and then rotated div , the grab handles are all wrong and I can not properly resize the div, it goes quite whacky
[15:36:49] <Ricaz> I know this is a CSS question, but.. #css seems kinda dead. I need some help. If someone could head over to http://rcz.dk/new/ and tell me why the gradient background doesn't fit the white seperators, I would greatly appreciate it.
[15:42:52] <nicholasschulz> is it possible to use jquery to check if a file exists? i have googled around and it says it is a huge security risk for some reason… i don't get it
[15:43:41] <MistuhKurtz> You can perform a get request to a URL and see what HTTP response code it returns
[15:43:54] <nafg___> nicholasschulz: A local file, or a file on the server?
[15:43:56] <MistuhKurtz> is that what you mean, nicholasschulz ?
[15:44:16] <MistuhKurtz> A local file on the client's computer is impossible, and would be the "huge security risk"
[15:44:18] <nafg___> It's not a limitation of jQuery but of javascript or browsers
[15:44:43] <nicholasschulz> on the server
[15:44:56] <nicholasschulz> on my own server, not client
[15:45:08] <MistuhKurtz> why not use a server-side language then
[15:45:22] <Snerf_> you could do it with an ajax call and call php file or such
[15:45:27] <nafg___> nicholasschulz: your google results were about local files
[15:45:44] <nicholasschulz> nafg__ ok
[15:45:54] <nafg___> What kind of file? A publicly accessible one?
[15:46:12] <nafg___> If so just ajax the file and check the result code, as MistuhKurtz said
[15:46:23] <nafg___> No need for PHP
[15:46:43] <nicholasschulz> Ok, thanks :-)
[15:47:51] <scotdb> If I define a dataTable column to have a class of (say) "mycolumn" and also have a $( "mycolumn").click(function() {alert "I was clicked" });  ..... should any data added to the table acquire the click functionality automatically or would I need to call something else to make it happen ?
[15:47:52] <nafg___> If it's some private file on the server computer you'd use PHP etc.
[15:49:09] <relipse> what tabs are you using
[15:53:34] <relipse> how do i add a class to an element?
[15:53:46] <relipse> and remove a class later on
[15:54:58] <scotdb> relipse $( "myselector").addClass('class_name');
[15:55:03] <michelem> hello folks
[15:55:23] <scotdb> similarly removeClass
[15:58:53] <zalzice> Hi, I have a problem with my jquery, I cant manage to get the value of id of the element. $(document).delegate(".box", "click", function(e){ ... }
[16:00:04] <michelem> I suppose this is a basic question, but I find no answer around:
[16:00:12] <Snerf_> $(this).attr('id')
[16:00:42] <zalzice> Snerf_: doesnt work:( but thanks
[16:00:52] <Snerf_> zalzice, should work
[16:00:57] <Snerf_> I use it all the time like such
[16:01:04] <michelem> I collapse a bunch of elements when loading a page. Clicking on their title expands them again. I now want to keep expanded an element #elemid if the URL is /#elemid
[16:01:45] <Snerf_> zalzice, maybe try .live instead of .delegate
[16:01:58] <michelem> I successfully do this, but the browser brings the user to the wrong offset because the above elements got collapsed. How can I bring the user back to the hash after collapsing?
[16:02:23] <michelem> live example: http://www.buddyns.com/faq/#why-so-fast
[16:03:05] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:07:57] <michelem> http://dpaste.de/SVw14/ <— here's the code I currently use. Line 12 is supposed to bring the user back to the right offset, but it does not.
[16:09:48] <nicholasschulz> I have this scenario (excuse me for being a newbie): var sum = myNumVar+1; where myNumVar=1     … this sum up to 11…. ?
[16:10:17] <Snerf_> in using .resizable() with a .transform and then rotate div , the grab handles are all wrong and I can not properly resize the div, it goes quite whacky
[16:11:28] <LessSeen> nicholasschulz: it is possible that it is just treating myNumVar as a string and concatenating it
[16:11:45] <LessSeen> try using parseInt() on it before you add the 1
[16:11:55] <nicholasschulz> thanks, ill try that :-)
[16:12:54] <nicholasschulz> worked, thanks LessSeen
[16:14:08] <Salvager> how do I use one() with on('click') ??

[16:21:45] <gaspyr> can anyone pm me to help me with a stupid bug in java, ive no idea whats wrong :(
[16:25:52] <io__> Hi need to build recurrently a hyperlink using links from a given list, inside a loop
[16:26:15] <Salvager> how do you use the .one() function with functions like .on() .live() and .delegate() ?? cant seem to find the answer anywhere
[16:27:29] <Salt> Yeah, this is for the logs/anyone who cares: If you are having issues with touchmove not firing, stop using jQuery, instead use getElementById. Hours will be saved.
[16:30:33] <snover> Salt: uh
[16:30:34] <snover> ok
[16:30:39] <snover> that makes no sense but whatever you say
[16:31:12] <nafg___> touchmove?
[16:31:27] <Salt> snover: yeah, I know, but I spent a number of hours today debugging why no console messages were being sent/why it wasn't firing
[16:33:16] <Salt> $("#element").bind("touchmove", function(e) { console.log("touchmove"); }, false); just would not call, switched to using pure js and it worked
[16:33:24] <Sisb> Does anyone know why the border colors aren't animating?  I've listed them seperately: http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/sCDt
[16:35:00] <MistuhKurtz> I've seen a script that would hide everything while a window is being resized, and then on 'mouseup' it would fire another function to resize stuff. How could that be accomplished? a normal jquery $(window).resize(function(){ ... }); doesn't seem like it would be able to do that
[16:35:48] <Sisb> Why doesn't that work MistuhKurtz
[16:36:02] <diverdude> MistuhKurtz: that sounds like a strange idea
[16:36:32] <MistuhKurtz> Because that only executes one callback, and the docs say that it depends on the browser whether the function executes continously as the window is being resized, or on 'mouseup' when it's in its final resting place
[16:37:04] <MistuhKurtz> Ideally I'm thinking of something like $(window).resize(funcDuring, funcAfter);
[16:37:29] <Jyhem> hi, I have a variable from a textarea content which has lines of text. How can i cycle through the lines ?
[16:37:34] <diverdude> why would you want to hide during resize???
[16:38:17] <diverdude> Jyhem: you gotta do a split on the string looking for newline feed and run a $.each
[16:38:43] <Jyhem> got it. thanks diverdude
[16:38:44] <phonebook_> new Regex(/\n/g).match($("textarea").html()); ?
[16:38:57] <nicholasschulz> how do i completely unset an already used variable?
[16:40:15] <phonebook_> = null; ?
[16:40:21] <snover> sigh
[16:40:31] <phonebook_> SIGHS LOUDER
[16:40:34] <phonebook_> what?
[16:41:27] <MistuhKurtz> eh it's a pretty minor thing. The page I saw showed an "resize image" when the browser was being resized and then once it finished sizing it adjusted the page elements accordingly. Because if the resize function is firing continously, it can drag down on resources and not look too great
[16:42:05] <nicholasschulz> phonebook, thanks for answering. i defined the var twice, that was the issue….
[16:52:27] <Salvager> how can I use this jQuery(this).data('clicked', true); inside the success function af an AJAX call ?
[16:52:50] <Salvager> *complete function
[16:54:58] <diverdude> Salvager: ???
[16:55:04] <diverdude> Salvager: you just use it
[16:55:09] <Salvager> it dosent work
[16:55:30] <Salvager> think its because it thinks that data is the data return from the ajax call
[16:55:34] <Salvager> which it isnt
[16:57:06] <diverdude> it thinks what you instructed it to
[16:57:17] <phonebook_> at you accessing it after it is set? also, what about just .attr("data-mything", true); ?
[16:57:23] <MimiEA> hey guys i have a weird idea and i dont know if it makes sense, it is possible using js to grab a mouse and 'control it ' ? not just capture the position
[16:57:38] <phonebook_> no
[16:57:45] <phonebook_> that is impossible
[16:58:22] <Salvager> what do you mean accessing it after it set?
[16:58:42] <Salvager> its used as a flag, to see weather or not the element have been clicked
[16:58:47] <phonebook_> are you trying to read .data("clicked", true) after you know the ajax success has run?
[16:59:07] <shoky> Salvager: what AJAX call?
[16:59:09] <phonebook_> what about .css("border", "5px solid Red;"); on it as a reality check
[16:59:18] <MimiEA> phonebook_ :mmm ( while i understand why.. due to security issue)  what does prevent that ?
[16:59:25] <shoky> the 'this' is probably the problem..
[16:59:33] <Salvager> http://pastebin.com/KDFicaZX
[16:59:36] <Salvager> thats my code
[16:59:44] <phonebook_> yes, you will never get control of a mouse in javascript
[16:59:51] <phonebook_> its hard to do in c#/win32
[16:59:52] <diverdude> MimiEA: you can make a .exe file if you want that :)
[17:00:16] <phonebook_> you can change the cursor in css!
[17:00:32] <MimiEA> diverdude : yes with .exe it's easier
[17:00:47] <phonebook_> maybe hide it and then moving something around - tricking the stupid users into thinking you have control of their mouse
[17:00:47] <Salvager> yeah I guess im going with adding some css, unless one of your have a neat fix
[17:00:58] <diverdude> MimiEA: with .exe its possible :) with .js its not
[17:01:09] <shoky> Salvager: http://pastebin.com/BVh91Ur2
[17:01:15] <phonebook_> a plugin? flash maybe... of java.. maybe
[17:01:25] <phonebook_> or
[17:02:03] <diverdude> MimiEA: yeah...hide to cursor, and then as Salvager says display a moving image of a cursor :)
[17:02:36] <Salvager> dindt fix it shoky, but thanks though
[17:03:00] <Salvager> ohh 2 sec, think i was just a bit to quick there
[17:03:03] <shoky> your use of 'this' was definitely wrong though, so keep my changes..
[17:03:26] <MimiEA> diverdude : Im not try to capture without permission... grab the mouse upon agreement from the otherside ( well some sort of agreement ) - like a remote control over web browser..
[17:03:43] <diverdude> MimiEA: hide curser: cursor: none;
[17:03:43] <Salvager> It works thanks mate!! :)
[17:04:01] <diverdude> MimiEA: and do a fixed div with a cursor image background
[17:04:07] <diverdude> :D
[17:04:19] <phonebook_> java or an active x plugin is your best bet in my opinion, maybe silverlight, flash... or trick them maybe
[17:04:25] <diverdude> haha thats a fun idea...i should try that just fpr the fun of it
[17:04:28] <shoky> ;]
[17:04:33] <MimiEA> lol
[17:04:53] <phonebook_> or ask them nicely for their credit card numbers, you never know
[17:05:14] <phonebook_> *mouse moves towards citibank login
[17:05:16] <phonebook_> oh no, help
[17:05:22] <diverdude> haha
[17:05:30] <Salvager> what does the var self, actually hold now?
[17:05:35] <MimiEA> Ok the reason is that i have many computers and too many mouse... and i dont like those stupid programs to control several mouse
[17:05:44] <diverdude> put random numbers in the input field of citibank login
[17:05:45] <Salvager> is it some unique ID?
[17:05:47] <shoky> Salvager: it holds what you thought that 'this' holds, it just saves it into a variable called 'self'
[17:06:16] <shoky> Salvager: no it's just copying 'this' into 'self', because inside your ajax success callback, 'this' points to something else entirely
[17:06:26] <Salvager> Im thinking that 'this' is a reference to the clicked element, am I wrong?
[17:06:32] <shoky> (namely, the jqXHR object that $.ajax returns)
[17:06:47] <phonebook_> users are so stupid
[17:06:49] <shoky> Salvager: 'this' changes a lot when you move into functions
[17:06:57] <Salvager> allright
[17:07:01] <Salvager> thanks alot for the help
[17:07:12] <shoky> Salvager: so you need to cache it like that into a variable if you want to keep a safe reference to it
[17:07:31] <Salvager> yeah I understand
[17:07:42] <shoky> goody
[17:07:53] <Salvager> it was just that kind of neat fix I was looking for hehe
[17:09:31] <nicholasschulz> I'm using an ajax call to check if a file exists, and if error i edit a variable while I'm in the ajax script. when i test to see if the variable is changed ( alert(myVar); ) it show the new value, but it I do the same test OUTSIDE and AFTER the ajax, the value is the same old?
[17:10:29] <phonebook_> cause its asynchronous
[17:10:30] <phonebook_> ?
[17:11:22] <nicholasschulz> please explain?
[17:11:48] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ nicholasschulz
[17:11:48] <bot-t> nicholasschulz, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:11:51] <phonebook_> instead of executing one line of code right after the other it breaks free, does its thing, and comes back when its done
[17:12:00] <phonebook_> so the code right after is happening before it gets back maybe
[17:12:21] <phonebook_> but i think the default ajax for jquery is synchronous
[17:12:46] <nicholasschulz> got it. thanks. do u know how i can bypass this?
[17:12:48] <shoky> no way
[17:12:53] <shoky> the default is definitely async
[17:13:03] <phonebook_> if it is set to asychronous you can set it to sychnronous
[17:13:11] <shoky> nicholasschulz you don't want to bypass it
[17:13:19] <nicholasschulz> ok shoky
[17:13:37] <shoky> you want to use the callbacks to do whatever is needed to be done _AFTER_ the request is done
[17:13:57] <nicholasschulz> but, then I'm having a hard time updating the value of that specific variable
[17:14:14] <shoky> why
[17:15:00] <nicholasschulz> because the same value sticks to it even if i update it while in the error on ajax
[17:15:22] <phonebook_> code?
[17:15:44] <shoky> if you only update it in the callbacks, then you should only make any dependent changes you need, in the callback
[17:17:08] <shoky> if something needs to happen AFTER the ajax is done, then it needs to happen in the callbacks
[17:17:23] <shoky> remember your callbacks dont have to be anonymous inline functions
[17:18:13] <nicholasschulz> http://tinkerbin.com/t39WC4A3
[17:18:27] <nicholasschulz> line 10
[17:18:58] <nicholasschulz> i want that to stay updated if the error occurs and the variable is set to equal 1
[17:20:16] <shoky> a quick fix is:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Yqg23/
[17:21:17] <shoky> (that's adding another callback to be run on success OR error
[17:21:27] <shoky> but the key point is the code is in a callback
[17:23:32] <shoky> nicholasschulz: and a bit neater like this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Yqg23/1/
[17:25:05] <nicholasschulz> get "unexpected TOKEN error" on .always ?
[17:26:00] <shoky> what jq ver?
[17:26:34] <shoky> actually
[17:26:37] <shoky> paste your code..
[17:26:50] <shoky> unless its exactly my fiddle?
[17:27:01] <nicholasschulz> its exactly your fiddle
[17:27:36] <shoky> what jq ver?
[17:27:40] <shoky> and paste your code :P
[17:27:49] <phonebook_> google says that in 2020 people will think tablets are stupid because we will be controlling things with out brains
[17:28:05] <shoky> ah maybe it's because jsfiddle sometimes adds some lame invisible character ?
[17:28:10] <ScottG489> Holy shit who's brain will we use?
[17:28:20] <nicholasschulz> shaky its on this line:  viewImage_id = viewImage_idAlbum + "_" + viewImage_idNextImg;
[17:28:37] <phonebook_> whoever has the money to buy one and the balls to not fear being turned into a zombie by a computer hacker
[17:28:39] <nicholasschulz> shoky*
[17:29:25] <phonebook_> ^^ i mean  OUR
[17:29:47] <shoky> nicholasschulz oh..
[17:30:22] <shoky> nicholasschulz: what is viewImage_id
[17:30:56] <nicholasschulz> the name of the image file without extension
[17:30:58] <shoky> nicholasschulz: you didn't get that error before when running your code?
[17:31:15] <nicholasschulz> so; abc.jpg   -> viewImage_id=abc
[17:31:17] <nicholasschulz> nope
[17:31:49] <nicholasschulz> but it might be what you said about invisible chars, ill see if i can activate "Show invisible"
[17:33:37] <nicholasschulz> nah, its not that… i rewrote the sentence and now its ILLEGAL……
[17:34:05] <nicholasschulz> http://bannaky.com/blog/ check the console
[17:35:15] <shoky> no error
[17:36:50] <shoky> i see your old code there, not mine tho
[17:38:29] <nicholasschulz> ok, let me update it.
[17:39:01] <nicholasschulz> now its live
[17:39:40] <shoky> that's my first fiddle
[17:40:28] <nicholasschulz> now the last
[17:43:25] <shoky> i get the error on this line  $('#viewImage_btnClose').click(function(){
[17:44:03] <nicholasschulz> if i replace your fiddle with my old, btnClose works…. so thats kinda wierd..
[17:44:40] <nicholasschulz> what line?
[17:44:45] <nicholasschulz> i get line 50
[17:44:57] <shoky> 52
[17:45:34] <shoky> umm
[17:45:41] <shoky> you have a click handler inside a click handler?
[17:45:46] <nicholasschulz> still thats ajaxReq.always in my file… don't get it
[17:45:54] <nicholasschulz> what? where?
[17:45:59] <shoky> $('.postPic_thumb').click(function(){
[17:46:06] <shoky> $('#viewImage_btnNext').click(function() {
[17:46:35] <shoky> you pasted the fiddle in the wrong spot :P
[17:48:36] <shoky> or you just didnt close that first handler, donno
[17:49:26] <nicholasschulz> think i forgot to close it, cause its code underneath your fiddle
[17:51:34] <nicholasschulz> umm,,,, if i close it where its supposed to it doesn't load the next picture……. oh my god…. frustrated
[17:56:02] <nicholasschulz> guess ill have to figure that one out tomorrow… 3AM in norway, later.
[17:56:22] <shoky> 4AM here
[17:56:24] <shoky> laters
[17:56:33] <nicholasschulz> haha
[17:57:52] <jonkersjoe> hi just wondering what the danger with using this.id vs $(this).attr('id', 'abc'); when used in the context of $('input').each(function(){….}); ? I see a lot of places suggesting to use $(this).attr('id', 'abc') instead of directly accessing attribute ?
[17:58:12] <shoky> jonkersjoe: this.id is perfectly fine
[17:58:34] <jonkersjoe> ok great, so there's no browser issues  ?
[17:58:47] <shoky> (and superior in every way to the alternative ;P)
[17:58:50] <shoky> none
[17:58:58] <jonkersjoe> great thanks shoky
[17:59:01] <shoky> ;]
[18:01:05] <tw2113> shoky stop being so helpful to everyone else and help me
[18:01:17] <tw2113> *pulls up a couch* so doc, i has issues
[18:01:22] <tw2113> throbbing mental ones
[18:01:35] <shoky> i suggest LSD
[18:01:44] <shoky> you can chain it
[18:02:13] <tw2113> woo1
[18:02:15] <imsky> yeeeah!
[18:02:16] <tw2113> !
[18:02:26] <RohanBhangui> imsky: hi
[18:02:31] <imsky> hey RohanBhangui
[18:02:38] <shoky> lol
[18:02:48] <RohanBhangui> im still figuring out how the e. stuff works
[18:02:56] <imsky> you've had a whole day buddy
[18:02:59] <RohanBhangui> i know its javascript(not jquery)
[18:03:01] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:03:05] <RohanBhangui> i have been working
[18:03:08] <RohanBhangui> jsut got home
[18:03:11] <RohanBhangui> 1/2 ago
[18:03:13] <ragas> $("#subheader").addClass("selected");  // OK    But,  var selectables=["subheader',"header","content"]; for(S in selectables) { $('#'+selectables[S]).addClass("selected"); } //No Good. ??  console.log(selectables[S]) looks correct.
[18:03:15] <RohanBhangui> *1/2 hour
[18:04:39] <imsky> ragas i doubt your code's wrong, maybe you're screwing up somewhere else
[18:05:43] <shoky> "subheader'
[18:06:29] <ragas> only a mistype in irc
[18:06:29] <imsky> good catch shoky
[18:06:33] <imsky> bad catch shoky
[18:06:44] <shoky> ungh ungh, eurmie
[18:06:45] <imsky> bad shoky bad
[18:06:52] <ragas> it would have broken the script
[18:07:03] <ragas> but thanks for looking.
[18:07:16] <imsky> ragas why are you doing it the stupid way anyway
[18:07:27] <imsky> $("#subheader, #header, #content").addClass("selected");
[18:07:57] <ragas> i have a trigger event mixed in that i didnt show, for brevity
[18:08:41] <ragas> trying to write smaht code, instead of repeating the trigger event for every selectable region
[18:08:54] <imsky> wat
[18:08:54] <b-ot> Hey, there's the word java in javascript, so that should guarantee the performance, right?
[18:09:11] <shoky> damnit
[18:09:28] <shoky> i was gonna submit that to W AT.json
[18:09:51] <shoky> testwat
[18:09:59] <shoky> wat_test
[18:10:00] <RohanBhangui> what is the equivilent of .addClass for ids
[18:10:18] <shoky> RohanBhangui: .attr('id', 'newID')
[18:10:39] <ragas> http://jsfiddle.net/NxWaC/
[18:11:02] <RohanBhangui> shoky: okay
[18:12:13] <shoky> ragas dont loop like that and then expect your inner functions to point to the right S when they are triggered, by then S will already be "content" or smth
[18:12:59] <imsky> $($.map(selectables, function(i){return "#"+i}).join(",")).addClass("selected"); @ ragas
[18:13:08] <imsky> WORKS LIKE A CHORM
[18:13:37] <shoky> ragas, and a more naive fix would look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/NxWaC/1/
[18:13:47] <ragas> ahh, that looks more like the shchtuff randall was tryin to teach me..
[18:14:35] <imsky> actually hang on
[18:14:50] <imsky> $($.map(selectables, function(i){return $("#"+i)})).addClass("selected"); @ ragas
[18:14:55] <imsky> bam, needless bytes shaved
[18:14:58] <shoky> a bit less naive fix would look like: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/NxWaC/2/
[18:15:21] <shoky> and then you get to nicer stuff like imsky's
[18:15:26] <imsky> i do what i can
[18:15:42] <shoky> sorry forgot to close the .each(
[18:16:04] <ragas> thanks; i gotta up my game.
[18:31:26] <ragas> well, you're right, shoky.  they don't create the triggers correctly.  Is this just a poor place to automate, or should i be trying to do this with a closure?  This is a learning project.
[18:40:52] <csantovsky> which one is faster: $('div') or $('<div></div>')?
[18:41:42] <systemfault> lol
[18:42:33] <systemfault> csantovsky: What is faster? An apple or red bull?
[18:43:09] <csantovsky> systemfault: lol the first one should have been $('<div>')
[18:43:20] <systemfault> Ah!
[18:43:44] <mfoxdogg|work> csantovsky: dosn't matter, both end up the same
[18:43:46] <systemfault> Probably the same… as it uses innerHTML internally.
[18:44:22] <mfoxdogg|work> the second one might be nano seconds faster since the interpreter dosn't have to do it
[18:45:15] <systemfault> Browsers are good at parsing/fixing invalid markup :P
[18:46:05] <mfoxdogg|work> yeah but you shouldn't rely on it
[18:46:34] <imsky> csantovsky, those are two different things
[18:47:44] <csantovsky> indeed, that's the kind of thing I'd like to avoid... also, if I have several $('<div>') calls running on, say, an ipod, I wonder if the difference would be noticeable
[18:49:59] <csantovsky> imsky: you mean $('<div>') vs $('<div></div>')? (the original question was wrong, my fault)
[18:50:17] <imsky> caught the difference csantovsky, though the first should be $('<div/>')
[18:51:40] <csantovsky> hmm, it seems I've been doing the wrong thing my whole life. didn't know that / also applies to div tags :)
[18:51:58] <imsky> csantovsky, to answer your speed question, they're the same speed
[18:52:18] <imsky> you'd see a negligible slowdown with the whole <div></div>
[18:53:29] <csantovsky> interesting, thanks for the insight imsky
[18:53:37] <imsky> np
[18:59:08] <Lucky--> what validation plugin/framework/w-e would you guys recommend that works well on all of hte major mobile devices?
[19:02:08] <coldhead> Lucky--: http://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/
[19:03:13] <Lucky--> coldhead: I need custom validation as well
[19:04:28] <coldhead> Lucky--: i would lean as heavily as possible on the HTML5 validation which works well on mobile stuff and do whatever little custom stuff i needed by hand
[19:05:06] <Lucky--> coldhead: I agree 100% with you
[19:06:03] <Lucky--> it just doesnt seem to work correctly for me, im gonna try applying modernizer to it
[19:07:15] <coldhead> Lucky--: there are some decent html5 shims for older browsers if you need them, like https://github.com/dsheiko/HTML5-Form-Shim/
[19:07:35] <coldhead> but mobile stuff has been pretty good with html5 form for me
[19:07:38] <coldhead> forms*
[19:07:38] <Lucky--> coldhead: im trying the html5 boiler plate right now
[19:08:04] <Lucky--> https://mobilepayday.azurewebsites.net/#homeview
[19:08:23] <Lucky--> the validation looks like shit in there and is extremely uncustomizable :-(
[19:09:08] <Lucky--> hmm the form shim looks interesting

[19:59:01] <imsky> so
[19:59:01] <b-ot> imsky, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[19:59:08] <bwq> lmao
[19:59:09] <eternalsword> any reason .append would strip one id attribute.  It's unique. id in question is workflow-step0-substep-name-form0
[19:59:10] <bwq> who's b-ot
[19:59:17] <imsky> damn you're a noob
[19:59:18] <imsky> at life
[19:59:33] <imsky> eternalsword, one id attribute? from several?
[19:59:48] <bwq> some shitty bot you codedn, imsky? :D
[20:00:03] <imsky> bwq lol yeah i coded it in malaysia you skeevy failure
[20:00:07] <bwq> haha
[20:00:13] <bwq> somad
[20:00:23] <imsky> y u think im mad tho?
[20:00:28] <imsky> ur the pathetic virgin ctcping and googling me
[20:00:31] <imsky> I WONDER WHY
[20:00:33] <bwq> hahaha
[20:00:57] <bwq> you linked me to your own stuff when i was asking what's new
[20:01:00] <bwq> remember?
[20:01:03] <imsky> i dunno
[20:01:04] <imsky> maybe
[20:01:10] <eternalsword> imsky, I'm doing an insert of a string of html.  only the one element is losing the attribute.  for example, workflow-step0-substep-name-input0 works on one of its children.  Can't figure out why this particular one is vanishing.
[20:01:35] <imsky> eternalsword, paste your crap somewhere, i dunno what you're saying
[20:01:43] <imsky> sounds like goobledy glop
[20:08:14] <eternalsword> must be an edge case.  minimal test worked fine.  boo.
[20:14:36] <burhan> I'm having a bit of an issue with some simple code that should work, but it always submits the default action of the form. http://jsfiddle.net/HecfR/
[20:15:37] <imsky> burhan, i moved preventDefault to the bottom, everything works fine
[20:16:04] <burhan> ... man ...
[20:16:42] <burhan> that's just .. I guess that's what I get for staying up all night :/
[20:17:30] <burhan> I moved it down and its still giving the same
[20:18:03] <imsky> burhan, shouldn't be
[20:18:46] <burhan> hmm let me try something else
[20:19:25] <imsky> burhan, on last resort, try to do $("form").submit(function(e){e.preventDefault();})
[20:21:45] <burhan> ...
[20:21:50] <burhan> you aren't going to believe this
[20:21:58] <burhan> but jquery url was giving 404 -.-

[21:58:56] <eli_> please help me
[22:00:04] <dr0id> one sec
[22:09:25] <vl1234> @eli.......what u want exactly
[22:11:17] <eli_> wait, i making sample..
[22:15:09] <jonkersjoe> hmmm great trolll
[22:18:42] <eli_> i want this -> http://paste.debian.net/178860/
[22:20:29] <eli_> what can i do for this problem? drOid, vl1234, jonkersjoe.. and another.. Do you have good idea?
[22:25:10] <vl1234> @eli.......u mentioned var i where is i value......where it ill get
[22:28:17] <Cork> eli_: var list = $('#spanID')[0].attributes; for(var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) { alert(list[i].name); }
[22:29:45] <eli_> cork: not run..
[22:30:10] <Cork> not run?
[22:30:19] <Cork> you mean it doesn't run?
[22:30:33] <eli_> $('#spanID') not have 'attributes'
[22:30:54] <Cork> check my code again
[22:31:10] <Cork> try to run exactly what i gave you
[22:31:39] <guy> Say I want to bind the same action to more than one selector: page.sl.thumbnails.on('click', [..]
[22:31:44] <eli_> http://paste.debian.net/178863/
[22:31:56] <jonkersjoe> eli : try this : http://jsfiddle.net/T9LxH/
[22:31:57] <guy> so, I have page.sl.thumbnails. and say foo.bar. Is there a syntax for that?
[22:32:13] <jonkersjoe> run it and open up your console.
[22:32:25] <guy> Like [foo.bar, page.sl.thumbnails].on('click', [..]) or something
[22:32:48] <eli_> my console returned message "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'attributes' of undefined "
[22:32:54] <eli_> in chrome
[22:32:59] <Cork> uh...
[22:33:01] <jonkersjoe> hmmm.. what ?
[22:33:04] <Cork> your selector is wrong
[22:33:09] <jonkersjoe> its working for me ?
[22:33:14] <Cork> your looking for a name, not an id
[22:33:41] <eli_> wow!
[22:33:47] <Cork> eli_: replace $('#spanID') with $('span[name="spanID"]')
[22:34:03] <eli_> so, so thank you very much!!
[22:34:36] <guy> guys?
[22:34:37] <Cork> eli_: btw i'm quite sure your attributes are invalid too
[22:34:51] <Cork> i don't think [] is allowed in attribute names
[22:34:58] <jonkersjoe> guy?
[22:35:10] <Cork> eli_: and prefix your custom attributes with data-
[22:35:14] <guy> jonkersjoe: 12 lines up.
[22:35:22] <david`> is there a name for this: https://www.airbnb.com/
[22:35:23] <eli_> can't I use attribue array?
[22:35:30] <david`> you know, the image slider with a static content
[22:35:30] <Cork> no
[22:36:26] <Cork> guy: are those thinks variables?
[22:36:32] <guy> Ya.
[22:36:33] <Cork> or what?
[22:36:35] <jonkersjoe> guy : $("list of selectors").click(function(){….})…
[22:36:47] <guy> jonkersjoe: the selectors are variables.
[22:36:55] <Cork> ah
[22:37:13] <Cork> $(var1).and(var2).action
[22:37:17] <Cork> gah
[22:37:23] <Cork> sorry s/and/add/
[22:37:42] <guy> Uh. Of course.
[22:37:45] <guy> Thank you.
[22:37:48] <Cork> np
[22:38:10] <Cork> if they'r strings you can concat them though, that would prob be simpler
[22:38:26] <guy> They are jQuery objects.
[22:38:39] <Cork> var1.add(var2).action then
[22:39:02] <guy> Wouldn't that modify var1 by reference?
[22:39:06] <Cork> no
[22:39:10] <Cork> ?add
[22:39:11] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[22:39:20] <guy> Cool
[22:39:23] <Cork> bah its not in the info list :/
[22:39:41] <Cork> it should prob be called and instead
[22:39:51] <Cork> cause thats closer to what it does
[22:40:03] <Cork> (var1 and var2).action
[22:40:08] <Cork> kinda
[22:44:29] <eli_> cork: can't i use attribute array in everyway?
[22:44:43] <Cork> eli_: you would have to fake it
[22:44:53] <Cork> cause no, attributes are names
[22:45:02] <Cork> not variables
[22:45:36] <Cork> eli_: my suggestion is to use json in a single attribute instead
[22:46:45] <Cork> eli_: data-info="{&quot;one&quot;:1, &quot;two&quot;:2}"
[22:47:12] <Cork> and then you access it through $('#id').data('info')['one']
[22:47:23] <Cork> or $('#id').data('info').one if you prefer that
[22:53:12] <eli_> thank you advice.
[22:54:09] <eli_> your advice can use in javascript
[22:54:28] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[22:55:11] <eli_> but i want set in attributes array in tag. but can not use.. right?
[22:55:18] <eli_> like ... customAttr{'tel'} and customAttr['address] and customAttr('contry') .... all can not use array? ;(
[22:55:40] <Cork> like i said, attributes are names
[22:55:44] <Cork> name=value
[22:55:52] <Cork> there is nothingto handle connecting them
[22:55:57] <Cork> *nothing to
[22:56:01] <eli_> thank you
[23:07:16] <Lucky--> http://code.google.com/p/mobiscroll/ <-- i would recommend this
