[00:05:28] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[00:05:38] <Starcraftmazter> is it possible to addClass() in such a way that it overrides all current properties?
[00:06:12] <ElDiabolo> Hi. I want to load jquery by adding a script tag to the DOM. Any hints why this is not working ($ not defined)?
[00:08:16] <beachandbytes> ElDiabolo, is jquery loaded before you script?
[00:10:16] <beachandbytes> Starcraftmazter, the only way I can think to do that is to add the class to a new hidden dom element, enumerate all the attr, and add important to them
[00:10:23] <beachandbytes> on the element you wish to change
[00:11:47] <ElDiabolo> beachandbytes, No, The requirement is to add only one script tag to the page. So I am adding a js src, and from this js source I want to load jQuery. My function to add script tags add the end of the head (via DOM) works, but fails when using it with jQuery.
[00:12:20] <ElDiabolo> (and no we are not carders)
[00:13:16] <Jattenalle> what?
[00:16:02] <beachandbytes> ElDiabolo, i would just look at how $.getscript works
[00:16:03] <beachandbytes> and copy that
[00:18:21] <Tomashe> anyone knows what i do wrong here :
[00:18:32] <Tomashe> profiles = $.parseJSON(profiles);					
[00:18:32] <Tomashe> profiles.unshift($.parseJSON(data));
[00:18:32] <Tomashe> profiles = JSON.stringify(profiles);
[00:18:38] <Tomashe> data is a json string
[00:20:53] <basiclaser> hey guys can anyone see whats wrong with this jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/aa6pn/
[00:21:07] <basiclaser> the text is supposed to expand
[00:21:16] <tw2113> do you have the jquery plugin for that loaded?
[00:21:57] <Starcraftmazter> beachandbytes: found another way, get rid of style attr
[00:22:27] <beachandbytes> that will overload inline styles at least
[00:22:31] <beachandbytes> but not other classes applied
[00:22:43] <beachandbytes> and will change styles not included in the new class
[00:23:11] <basiclaser> ah i forgot to include a link to the actual inflateTextjs file T_T
[00:24:54] <tw2113> if i had a dime for every time someone else forgot to include a resource?.i'd have a nickel!
[00:25:24] <Starcraftmazter> beachandbytes: thats what i want
[00:25:39] <Jattenalle> tw2113, that's just rude! coming in here, bragging about your wealth and riches :'(
[00:26:03] <tw2113> you don't hear me complaing about minimum wages, i'm happy to have at least a nickel!
[00:26:23] <tw2113> complaining*
[00:26:43] <basiclaser> how can i include external resources that aren't hosted in CDN? (inflateTextJS)
[00:26:58] <tw2113> do they have a github page?
[00:27:05] <tw2113> you could link to the raw file there
[00:29:06] <tw2113> anywho, bed time
[00:38:57] <ElDiabolo> Hi. I am having a weird timing issue. I am loading jQuery by inserting a script tag. (See http://pastebin.com/NcgUrwmC).  After doing this the first alert(typeof(window.$)); gives undefined, while the second one gives function. Seems the script is loaded during the first alert. Can I wait for the script to load?
[00:39:47] <ElDiabolo> Sorry, this is rather a javascript question.
[00:45:30] <fabioportieri> ElDiabolo: put your code inside $(document).ready(function() { //here });
[00:47:17] <ElDiabolo> fabioportieri, This gives a $ is not defined, since jQuery is not yet loaded.
[00:49:22] <ElDiabolo> fabioportieri, But actually in my case the simple solution is to use onload = function () {.., at onload time jQuery is loaded and usabl.
[00:50:45] <baedert> hey, what's the most elegant way to dynamically create large new elements(without loads of createEelement, addClass, append, ... calls)?
[00:52:57] <fabioportieri> ElDiabolo: why are you loading jquery dinamically?
[00:59:26] <basiclaser> hey guys, with google embedded videos, does &loop=1 still work ? I can't get a video to repeat
[01:39:55] <foo> I am using http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2010/01/smoothly-scroll-to-an-element-without-a-jquery-plugin/ to scroll to a div, but for some reason it scrolls to the middle of the div. I'm stumped, any tips?
[01:40:28] <cbsw> Why my generated html snippets not rendered with jquery ui ?
[01:44:02] <a_fejer> foo: if you look at the example from your link, there is an anchor defined: "#elementID", the plugin should scroll to the beginning of the element with the id
[01:44:29] <a_fejer> you should also check if you are not using the anchor ID twice on the page.
[01:44:56] <cbsw> for example: $("body").append("<button>Click me</button>")   generates a button,but this button doesn't have jquery ui style
[01:46:10] <fabioportieri> cbsw: you didn't setup a class for it
[01:47:37] <foo> a_fejer: Thank you! I definitely only have it once, and I am pointing to the correct ID. ID is a big div, the strange thing is it goes to the middle of the div.
[01:47:51] <foo> a_fejer: oh wait... this may be because of the floating nav bar on top, that's why it's getting cut off.
[01:48:09] <seutje> so it isn't scrolling to the middle
[01:48:13] <seutje> it's just overlapping?
[01:48:24] <cbsw> fabioportieri: Sorry I forget in this example. But even i set a class for it, it's not rendered either
[01:48:27] <foo> seutje: correct. Hmmm.
[01:48:37] <seutje> I was trying funky shit with negative margins
[01:49:07] <foo> seutje / a_fejer - can't seem to be able to set offset().top + 10px or something, right?
[01:49:30] <seutje> sure, but 10px isn't a numver
[01:49:32] <seutje> number
[01:49:49] <foo> seutje: hm, + 10 :) /me tries
[01:49:49] <fabioportieri> cbsw: weird.. try make a jsfiddle out of it
[01:51:24] <seutje> foo: prolly want minus though
[01:51:26] <seutje> foo: http://jsfiddle.net/QqcW7/
[01:51:34] <foo> seutje: Got it. Thank you. :)
[01:51:54] <seutje> also, might not wanna hardcode that value
[01:52:16] <foo> seutje: ohh, I see what you did
[01:52:51] <seutje> (it only overlaps the 1px red line cause it's a outline, thus not taking up space)
[01:53:12] <seutje> make it a border and it'll respect it
[01:53:56] <foo> seutje: Great! Got it. I see what you did, much better since my previous fix was hardcoded. :) Thank you!
[01:53:59] <foo> seutje++
[02:04:46] <seutje> btw foo: Drupal adds the --2 to the ID for forms when it detects it is rendering the same form multiple times for the same request
[02:04:54] <lemonsparrow> I am starting with sample node.js application with mysql. I wrote a simple query to fetch data from table and display it in page... http://pastebin.com/0gb10TK3 but though the query works fine... I am getting undefined for all the 3 values
[02:05:09] <seutje> but sometimes it'll screw up context and drop duplicate IDs in the page
[02:06:52] <lemonsparrow> seutje: to me ?
[02:07:06] <seutje> nah, foo
[02:08:18] <seutje> lemonsparrow: try logging the entire rows object
[02:09:17] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I am getting the code correct when I run this in node console... the same code when I do node file.js I get undefined :(
[02:09:33] <lemonsparrow> seutje: what different does that makes ? it isnt throwing any connection exception either
[02:09:43] <seutje> u can see what is actually returned
[02:10:02] <lemonsparrow> unreal: how to log ?
[02:10:08] <lemonsparrow> seutje: how to log ?
[02:10:40] <seutje> u can just console.log afaik
[02:10:55] <seutje> but like, are you sure it isn't an array of arrays of objects?
[02:11:03] <seutje> like row[0][0].foo ?
[02:11:08] <lemonsparrow> seutje: it's just 3 variables ryt :)
[02:11:22] <lemonsparrow> seutje: and the same code runs in node console when I just copy paste
[02:11:27] <seutje> I'll take that as a "yes"
[02:12:26] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I think it's a call back issue
[02:12:42] <lemonsparrow> seutje: the console.log executing before mysql part.. something like ajax issue :)
[02:13:18] <lemonsparrow> seutje: connection.query('SELECT * from users', function (err, rows, fields) {     if (err) throw err;     userId = rows[0].user_id;     firstName = rows[0].first_name;     lastName = rows[0].last_name;     console.log("User ID : "+userId+" First Name : "+firstName+" Last Name : "+lastName); });
[02:13:20] <lemonsparrow> worked...
[02:14:13] <seutje> so it's fine now? o.O
[02:15:39] <lemonsparrow> seutje: worked this way.. http://pastebin.com/0gb10TK3 any better way to do this ?
[02:16:29] <PatBatem1n> hi
[02:16:53] <seutje> lemonsparrow: don't see anything significant that changed o.O
[02:17:11] <lemonsparrow> seutje: added a call back function server()
[02:17:45] <PatBatem1n> if I have an jquery ajax script that need to pass data to a php file, that is one level up, how to set the url option?
[02:18:22] <PatBatem1n> so the js is in: jcart/js/x.js  .. php : jcart/
[02:19:04] <seutje> lemonsparrow: huh, and that changed something? o.O
[02:19:27] <lemonsparrow> seutje: yes it worked :)
[02:19:41] <lemonsparrow> seutje: its something like the asynchronous issue....
[02:20:29] <seutje> that's odd, it's the same closure, should't matter when the server is instantiated, as long as the query returns before the first request comes
[02:21:39] <seutje> lemonsparrow: now ur console log at the bottom isn't very accurate anymore, should move it to the end of server()
[02:22:40] <lemonsparrow> seutje: that's just a message :) afterall
[02:24:03] <PatBatem1n> what is it mean ajax status code 0? Am I offline? a script say
[02:24:40] <Cork> PatBatem1n: most of the time it is a sign of script error or parse error
[02:24:44] <Cork> check the message
[02:24:53] <krambiorix> hi, i'm saving some html content to my database via ajax. How can i set the SELECTED attribute on the selected option on all my select boxes?
[02:25:46] <seutje> prolly want to store data, not markup, especially if form elements are involved
[02:27:43] <seutje> if ur dead set on throwing markup around, u can prolly go all $('option:selected').attr('selected', 'thisvaluedoesntevenmatter'), but you'd prolly have to remove it from the one that had it onload
[02:27:48] <PatBatem1n> Cork: best way to set ajax "url" opition? abs. or relative ?
[02:28:19] <Cork> PatBatem1n: doesn't really matter; it's up to you
[02:28:46] <Cork> though absolute without domain is normally the best
[02:29:05] <PatBatem1n> hm
[02:29:35] <PatBatem1n> so leave http://localhost/site and enter the folders after that?
[02:29:48] <Cork> no
[02:29:57] <Cork> $.ajax('/site/...')
[02:30:05] <PatBatem1n> i see
[02:30:06] <PatBatem1n> ty
[02:34:56] <david2309> krambiorix  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-get-selected-value-in-dropdown i think this is what you need
[02:55:26] <softplay> how can i change the dateformat of jqueryui datepicker?
[02:55:32] <softplay> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[02:57:34] <BinaryKitten> softplay have you checked the api docs rather than just the demos?
[02:57:47] <BinaryKitten> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat ---- ?
[02:58:16] <fabioportieri> reading docs is optional in freenode :p
[02:59:35] <softplay> yes i see i haven't read it all..
[02:59:39] <softplay> thanks
[02:59:44] <BinaryKitten> np
[03:00:02] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri yeah the link to the api docs needs to be bigger
[03:00:08] <BinaryKitten> it's easily missed
[03:00:20] <fabioportieri> yes, like all uppercase
[03:00:59] <fabioportieri> ..and jquery docs are very very good
[03:06:28] <krambiorix> seutje, i need to save the entire html... But when i clone() the div, the selected values in my select boxes have been resetted
[03:07:05] <seutje> krambiorix: do I repeat what I said earlier or will scrolling up work for you?
[03:07:57] <krambiorix> seutje, repeat
[03:08:03] <krambiorix> seutje, i don't understand : but you'd prolly have to remove it from the one that had it onload
[03:08:53] <vinex08> anyne her who can give me a link to a good pop-up optin on page load plugin?
[03:09:17] <seutje> krambiorix: one option will have been selected from the get-go, when changing that option, the attribute won't change, only the prop will
[03:09:32] <seutje> :selected selects those that have the prop selected
[03:09:36] <seutje> so u can map them over to attributes
[03:09:47] <seutje> but then there's still the one that had it originally
[03:09:58] <krambiorix> seutje, indeed
[03:10:29] <seutje> so then you'd (first) need to $('[selected]').removeAttr('selected') or something
[03:11:06] <Cork> seutje: prop('selected', false please ;)
[03:11:27] <seutje> nah, the prop shouldn't be changed
[03:11:36] <seutje> ur just trying to have the markup reflect the actual values
[03:11:49] <Cork> ah
[03:12:02] <seutje> he's doing the whole send-markup-to-backend thing again
[03:12:48] <seutje> krambiorix: to grab the markup, u can just parentElement.innerHTML or w/e
[03:13:02] <seutje> sending the clone will get you like [Object object] at the backend
[03:14:58] <bgy> Hi
[03:15:06] <bgy> Is there any tips to do something like var $item = $('#foo-item') || $('#bar-item'); ?
[03:15:17] <bgy> and avoid an if $item.length, etc.
[03:15:25] <Cork> $('#foo-item, #bar-item');
[03:15:33] <Cork> ah
[03:15:37] <Cork> you just want one of them?
[03:17:00] <bgy> Cork, yeah
[03:17:12] <Cork> that makes a bit more complicated...
[03:17:17] <bgy> well I've the code which should execute when either there is one
[03:17:34] <bgy> yep :(
[03:17:41] <Cork> bgy: oh, so both can't be true?
[03:18:11] <ravenzz> if the first doesn't exists, select the second
[03:18:23] <Cork> and can the second exist if the first exist?
[03:18:29] <ravenzz> I guess
[03:18:44] <ravenzz> it is like var foo = foo || {}
[03:18:52] <ravenzz> I mean
[03:18:54] <Cork> i know what you mean
[03:18:55] <ravenzz> var bar = foo || {}
[03:18:57] <bgy> Cork, nope
[03:19:00] <Cork> but you can't do that with jquery
[03:19:04] <ravenzz> I know
[03:19:24] <bgy> that lets me think that $('#foo-item, #bar-item') should work then
[03:19:25] <Cork> bgy: then you can just do $('#foo-item, #bar-item');
[03:19:27] <bgy> yeah
[03:19:28] <Cork> ya
[03:19:29] <bgy> thanks
[03:24:31] <SamuraiDio> Hi, does people uses/recommends some template engine for Javascript? Like Mustache?
[03:24:47] <SamuraiDio> ...as jquery doesn't have one
[03:27:49] <_rgn> SamuraiDio: _.template (from underscore or lodash)
[03:28:37] <SamuraiDio> _rgn, thanks,
[03:32:50] <Cork> SamuraiDio: jqote2 is nice too
[03:34:02] <SamuraiDio> Cork, underscore is already part of the project, so it's just natural to use it.
[03:34:32] <Cork> ah, didn't know you already used underscore
[03:39:08] <krambiorix> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/rQ5vr/
[03:53:42] <Kingsy> if you do something like --> jQuery("#type").change(function() { console.log(this.value); }  how would you grab the object "this" without using the change() function? so just grab the currenct select element? using console.log(jQuery("#type").value); returns undefined, so thats not right.
[03:55:39] <Anand_Sudhanaboi> Use $("#element");
[03:56:17] <Kingsy> Anand_Sudhanaboi: sorry? I am using that.. referencing it using its id
[03:56:45] <Kingsy> Anand_Sudhanaboi: I should have mentioned, I am using noConflict mode because of prototype.. just substitute jQuery with $ in the example
[03:56:58] <Cork> Kingsy: i hink your looking for jQuery('#type')[0]
[03:57:32] <Kingsy> Cork: exactly it man!!! thanks
[03:57:55] <lite_> so im trying to create an array of all elements in the dom with the class widget_list_button
[03:58:13] <Cork> seutje: hmm do i remember correctly and you had a way to access js on github with the correct mime type?
[03:58:16] <lite_> the problem is the dom elements havent been created by the time i call $('.widget_list_button')
[03:58:27] <lite_> how do I know that the page has finished loading ?
[03:58:35] <Cork> lite_: the ready event
[03:58:48] <Cork> or if it's from ajax you need to wait for the callback
[03:58:57] <Cork> (the done/complete callback from the ajax call)
[03:59:06] <Anand_Sudhanaboi> $(document).onready(function() { console.log("Page Loaded");} );
[03:59:12] <Cork> uh, no
[03:59:32] <Cork> $(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {})
[04:05:27] <Cork> scary...
[04:05:34] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/girak/2
[04:05:48] <Cork> you can disable the console in chrome >_>
[04:05:52] <Cork> (from the webpage)
[04:06:47] <Anand_Sudhanaboi> why you need to do it?
[04:07:01] <Cork> Anand_Sudhanaboi: i don't
[04:07:25] <seutje> Cork: replace raw.github.com with rawgithub.com
[04:07:31] <Cork> Anand_Munna: but apparently facebook is doing this
[04:07:33] <Cork> seutje: thx
[04:08:13] <Cork> Anand_Munna: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21692646/how-does-facebook-disable-developer-tools
[04:08:35] <seutje> do note: https://rawgithub.com/#what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole
[04:08:55] <Cork> heh
[04:09:04] <Cork> seutje: i need to fix a broken jsfiddle
[04:09:17] <Cork> seutje: way to many use raw.github.com for js files there
[04:10:09] <seutje> Cork: oh, yeah, and then don't look at the console telling you it's not parsing it
[04:10:24] <Cork> seutje: ya
[04:10:38] <Cork> and the most annoying is that some browser does content sniffing
[04:11:03] <Cork> "hmm this looks like js so i'm going to take this as text/javascript instead"
[04:11:12] <Cork> so they think it work, when it actually doesn't
[04:14:06] <Cork> damn...
[04:14:12] <Cork> a googlecode.com too >_<
[04:14:23] * Cork gives up trying to get the example to work

[04:19:53] <d3m0n> Hey guys, having a bit of touble combing variables, can someone take a look at this: http://pastie.org/8725847 How would I go about combining that cssAnimation variable into the css()?
[04:19:58] <seutje> if ur client doesn't support secure service communication, you can also just /msg nickserv help
[04:20:44] <seutje> d3m0n: clone the object and add the key/value?
[04:20:55] <seutje> or don't clone if u don't care about hosing the original
[04:22:07] <seutje> d3m0n: like this for instance: http://pastie.org/8725856
[04:24:29] <d3m0n> Hrmm okay seutje I see what you did there, although that seem longer than what I have orginally so I dont know if thats worth changing then
[04:24:53] <d3m0n> I figured I was writing/setting up the cssAnimation variable wrong
[04:25:06] <d3m0n> Where I could include additional css styles
[04:25:16] <seutje> oh sure
[04:25:47] <hmmp> how can I check is DOM element data with certain key empty? like $("input").data("key1")
[04:26:15] <seutje> d3m0n: http://pastie.org/8725870
[04:27:24] <Cork> hmmp: == undefined
[04:27:59] <d3m0n> haha yeah thanks seutje but not exactly what I was thinking: My train of thought was dropping the brakets and letting adding it to css() like: css({cssAnimation, 'right': '0px'}) - http://pastie.org/8725876
[04:28:33] <seutje> that's a syntax error
[04:28:33] <d3m0n> I can't add the right style into that because cssAnimation is used more than once and right value is changed
[04:28:37] <d3m0n> yeah
[04:28:42] <seutje> ur first object value has no key
[04:28:56] <seutje> either u merge or extend
[04:29:06] <seutje> can't overload + for it or something
[04:30:04] <hmmp> Cork: thank you :)
[04:30:12] <d3m0n> Ok thanks seutje that's what I was trying to figure out
[04:30:42] <seutje> d3m0n: no shame in chaining though like .css(cssAnimation).css('other', 'prop')
[04:31:01] <seutje> sure, it's an extra function call and all, but the difference will be marginal
[04:31:10] <d3m0n> Just thought there'd be a nice looking/shorter way
[04:31:43] <d3m0n> But that'll have to do then :)
[04:37:14] <lite_> I have this array of elements that have been declared like this : var arr = $('.list_buttons') the problem is that the amount of list_buttons may change at any point. how do I keep my array updated?

[04:47:27] <lite_> i realize this might me a stupid problem - But "how" expensive it is it to create an array of +1000 elements through a rather broad selector like $('.foo') ?
[04:48:18] <krambiorix> seutje, probably notinteresting for you , but i solved it
[04:48:36] <seutje> you'd be surprised how many things I find interesting
[04:53:19] <Cork> CrysAk: you mean you want to create an object with arr[0] as key?
[04:53:54] <CrysAk> Cork, I want to turnt he string 13-2 into an array with key13, vlaue 2
[04:54:13] <Cork> CrysAk: what string?
[04:54:22] <CrysAk> the string "13-2"
[04:54:38] <Cork> so you want { "13": "2" } ?
[04:56:21] <Cork> CrysAk: ?
[04:56:37] <CrysAk> as an array yes cork
[04:56:45] <seutje> wat?
[04:56:50] <Cork> arrays don't have keys
[04:57:24] <Cork> if you mean arr[13] = 2 you will create 13 empty array values
[04:57:30] <Cork> and set the 14'th to 2
[04:57:48] <lite_> so im declaring a document.keydown event listener. How do I delete that listener again ?
[04:57:50] <seutje> js> var foo = '12-3'.split('-'); bar = {}; bar[foo[0]] = foo[1]; print(bar['12']);
[04:57:56] <Cork> js> var a = []; a[13] = 2; print(JSON.stringify(a))
[04:58:10] <seutje> b-ot? :(
[04:58:15] <Cork> :)
[04:58:16] <Cork> dead
[04:58:20] <CrysAk> thanks
[04:58:23] <Cork> apparently
[04:58:36] <Cork> CrysAk: the point is you want an OBJECT not an array
[04:58:38] <CrysAk> do i need to specift "js >"
[04:58:43] <Cork> no
[04:58:46] <seutje> think the service dies
[04:58:48] <seutje> died*
[04:59:03] <Cork> CrysAk: what you want to do is create an empty object and set the result from split to it
[04:59:04] <seutje> oh lol
[04:59:11] <Cork> actually there is another option
[04:59:43] <CrysAk> jsut to make sure, i can then send this object via post as an array right?
[04:59:55] <Cork> hmm opps no that won't work
[05:00:03] <Cork> CrysAk: you can
[05:00:18] <CrysAk> hmm basically i want to get everything witht he same class froma  form , into an array and onto another page using $.post
[05:00:24] <Cork> CrysAk: jquery will convert it to params automatically
[05:00:48] <Cork> CrysAk: the you need to make sure if you want arrays or objects
[05:01:02] <Cork> cause your mixing up the terms right now making it hard to tell what you want
[05:01:03] <CrysAk> ok, so if i run this conversion of a string into an object within an .each, will it override each time or add
[05:01:10] <Cork> [1,2,3,4,5,6] <-- array
[05:01:32] <Cork> {key:1, '12':2} <-- object
[05:01:32] <CrysAk> i thought arrays had keys too?
[05:01:37] <Cork> no
[05:01:47] <Cork> that is just how php calls it
[05:01:53] <CrysAk> oh, misscommunication ebtween jquery and php?
[05:01:56] <CrysAk> ahhh yea
[05:01:58] <CrysAk> gotcha :)
[05:02:01] <Cork> all other languages calls it hash, or objects or maps or...
[05:02:10] <Cork> but not array
[05:02:11] <CrysAk> thanskf or clearing that up
[05:02:14] <Cork> cause it really isn't
[05:02:24] <CrysAk> so if i cast this string to an object within an .each, will it add to the object or replace it?
[05:02:25] <Tekla> associative array? :)
[05:02:38] <Cork> Tekla: a term that doesn't exist
[05:02:44] <Cork> but ya that is what php calls it
[05:02:56] <Cork> an array is a start with offsets for values
[05:03:02] <Cork> you don't have keys in it
[05:03:40] <Tekla> Cork: wiki disagrees
[05:03:51] <Cork> Tekla: what wiki?
[05:04:04] <Tekla> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array
[05:04:17] <seutje> lol
[05:04:25] <Cork> lovely
[05:04:36] <Cork> associative array and there examples are objects...
[05:04:41] <Cork> nice...
[05:05:07] * Tekla crawls back under his rock
[05:05:17] <Cork> Tekla: but the comment stands if you look at how arrays works in most languages
[05:05:28] <d3m0n> Does this not delay the css being added: open.delay(1550).css('opacity','1'); ?
[05:05:36] <Cork> no
[05:05:45] <Cork> delay is only for functions that does animations
[05:05:47] <Tekla> sorry... waiting for system upgrade
[05:05:51] <d3m0n> Ah ok
[05:05:58] <Cork> for all the other you need to use setTimeout
[05:06:02] <seutje> "In JavaScript (see also JSON), all objects behave as associative arrays"
[05:06:04] <d3m0n> Thnx Cork
[05:06:11] <Cork> or if you REALLY want delay you need to use queue()
[05:06:17] <seutje> let's rant about semantics, that's always helpful!
[05:08:27] <CrysAk> Cork, how do i debug this (to check what is in the object i jsut created? alert(object()); ?
[05:08:43] <Cork> console.log()
[05:09:09] <Cork> and if the browsers developer tools can't handle display objects
[05:09:18] <Cork> use console.log(JSON.stringify(object))
[05:09:42] <d3m0n> Cork, can it work for .show() and .hide()?
[05:09:47] <CrysAk> ahh tahnks :) love love
[05:09:59] <Cork> d3m0n: only if you give a duration to show and hide
[05:10:15] <d3m0n> .delay(300).show(1)
[05:10:41] <Cork> ya
[05:10:51] <Cork> though that really is a dirty hack
[05:10:51] <d3m0n> Thnx!
[05:10:55] <d3m0n> LOL
[05:11:08] <Cork> it is cleaner to do setTimeout(function() { $().show() }, 300)
[05:11:21] <Cork> or use callback for another animation if you need that
[05:11:23] <d3m0n> haha ok
[05:22:27] <ankurk> So I am trying to hide a jquery dialog button on a specific condition but after the other button is clicked, it still shows up. Here's my code, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/8955450
[05:23:25] <Cork> ankurk: .dialog('widget').find('#addItemBtn')
[05:23:43] <Cork> the button isn't a child of the original object
[05:23:53] <Cork> it is a child of an element that wraps your original object
[05:24:28] <ankurk> Cork: I essentially want to hide the delete button when this condition is true, $(this_button).closest('td').prev('td').find('input').val() === "1"
[05:24:59] <ankurk> You can ignore the commented code
[05:26:23] <Cork> har to follow what the problem is
[05:26:36] <ankurk> Well, let me explain.
[05:26:49] <Cork> ankurk: alos $('#edit_punch_list_dialog #addItemBtn') is totally pointless
[05:26:57] <Cork> $('#addItemBtn') is just as safe
[05:27:06] <ankurk> When the input val is 1, I want to hide the Delete button
[05:27:07] <Cork> as id's can't exist in more then one place in the dom
[05:27:43] <ankurk> the Delete button I added in Buttons
[05:27:50] <ankurk> you can ignore that
[05:28:54] <ankurk> Issue is even after I am removing the Delete button from DOM, it still pops up
[05:29:10] <ankurk> On that certain condition only
[05:30:37] <Cork> ankurk: also you what is "this button"?
[05:30:43] <seutje> just as a side note: if you do $(something) twice within the same scope and the something is the same, you really should consider caching the return value and not re-querying the DOM for it
[05:31:09] <Cork> ya...
[05:31:27] <ankurk> This_Button is the reference to the current button & here's the updated Gist
[05:31:30] <ankurk> https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/8955450
[05:36:01] <Rhytz> Hi
[05:39:21] <Rhytz> I'm using jQuery and jQuery UI to apply effects to a certain class, using $(this).effect( 'slide') for example. However, this applies the effect to all classes at the same time. I want to iterate through each object with the same, wait for the effect to finish, and apply the effect to the next object with the same class. I've tried each(), but this doesnt wait for the effect to finish, so it still does all the effects at the same time
[05:40:21] <Rhytz> *all objects with the same class
[05:41:41] <Rhytz> tl;dr How can i queue effects on every object with the same class
[05:56:02] <ankurk> Anyone for my issue?
[05:56:57] <airdem> how can i prevent a html form element to send ints value on submit?
[05:57:06] <airdem> without removing the value and or the elment itself
[06:03:58] <fabioportieri> airdem: set it as disabled
[06:04:30] <ankurk> Now I know the cause of the issue
[06:04:57] <ankurk> The condition in the Open event is triggered only for one time
[06:04:58] <ankurk> :(
[06:08:30] <lite_> will $('.foo') select <div class="foo" hidden>bar</div> ?
[06:08:50] <seutje> sure
[06:09:09] <lite_> hm
[06:09:17] <airdem> yes
[06:09:30] <seutje> u know, this isn't like pharmaceuticals or anything, u can actually try it without killing ppl
[06:09:51] <seutje> relatively low-risk when doing it locally or a playground like jsfiddle
[06:09:52] <airdem> "hidden" is valid for <div> ?
[06:10:04] <seutje> don't think so
[06:10:15] <seutje> but is valid really... valid?
[06:10:25] <airdem> :)
[06:10:39] <seutje> oh wait, I guess it is
[06:11:09] <seutje> doesn't rly matter, it's only hidden from the render tree, jquery doesn't care about that unless you specifically tell it to
[06:11:09] <sess> What could possibly cause $.getJSON to call the error event when the response was a 200?
[06:11:19] <seutje> sess: malformed JSON?
[06:11:41] <seutje> bad mimetype?
[06:11:50] <sess> just realized while i wrote the question - I was just returning av string
[06:11:53] <seutje> empty response?
[06:12:00] <sess> changing to $.get solved it
[06:12:05] <seutje> aha, le mimetype it is!
[06:12:08] <seutje> or that
[06:12:14] <ankurk> Can anyone help me in resolving this issue? :(
[06:14:46] <seutje> ankurk: did you try Cork's suggestion?
[06:15:07] <ankurk> I don't have an issue with #addBtnItem
[06:15:28] <seutje> ok
[06:15:33] <ankurk> The issue I found out is the if condition in Open event is triggered only once
[06:15:49] <seutje> once per open, sure
[06:15:52] <seutje> makes sense
[06:16:06] <ankurk> after the subsequent dialog opens the if condition does not get triggered
[06:16:29] <ankurk> I mean if I open the same dialog again, the if condition won't get triggered
[06:17:27] <ankurk> Actually there's a bit of change, when I click on Change and do my stuff
[06:18:14] <ankurk> and Open the dialog again, the open event won't check the condition
[06:19:11] <ankurk> FYI, Change is for edit the form
[06:19:18] <ankurk> *editing
[06:20:16] <ankurk> Seutje: I think you have now understood my issue
[06:20:29] <ankurk> I can give more clarification if you want
[06:23:15] <seutje> ankurk: can't reproduce though, alerts every time for me: http://jsfiddle.net/sLh8U/
[06:23:51] <ankurk> This is fine
[06:24:34] <ankurk> But If I click the Change button to edit my form on the dialog, and open the dialog again, the open event is not triggered
[06:27:13] <seutje> wait, you re-initialize the entire dialog on every click, but you never destroy it?
[06:27:28] <seutje> why don'
[06:27:39] <sess> what's the cleanest way to prevent a global ajax error handler from firing?
[06:27:46] <seutje> why don't you initialize it without autoOpen and then just .dialog('open') on it?
[06:27:53] <sess> preferably from inside a .fail() function on an ajax request
[06:28:06] <seutje> sess: don't throw errors :D
[06:28:13] <sess> why not?
[06:28:21] <seutje> or rather, don't cause them
[06:28:32] <sess> it's about user input
[06:29:04] <sess> throwing errors enables me to reduce error handling code by like 95%
[06:29:07] <ankurk> So I have to destroy the dialog?
[06:29:17] <seutje> I'm confused, you want to throw errors at the user?
[06:29:32] <ankurk> You telling me?
[06:29:41] <seutje> nop
[06:29:47] <ryannielson> I have some code using the keyup event handler: https://gist.github.com/RyanNielson/8956503. It works fine for text inputs that are already on the page, but it doesn't work for input textboxes added to the page later using javascript. Isn't that the problem using on() is supposed to solve?
[06:29:48] <sess> seutje: I want to throw an exception from the server, and handle it with javascript
[06:29:49] <seutje> I already told you, you just ignored it, apparently
[06:30:05] <sess> anyways settings.supressErrors seems to do the trick
[06:30:22] <seutje> sess: u can set handlers for any response type, so u can have the server respond in a manner accordingly
[06:31:15] <sess> thing is I have a general error handler that catches all non-200 responses and handles it in a generic way. I want to handle this specific instance in a non-generic way and disable the global one so both doesn't run
[06:31:55] <seutje> so u wanna have the server return 200 with an error message? o.O
[06:32:28] <ankurk> Trying your suggestion now, Seutje
[06:32:44] <sess> no.. the server gives a 500 response
[06:33:08] <sess> which is normally handled by $(document).ajaxError causing an alert
[06:33:27] <sess> I wanted to do something else and not cause the alert for this specific error
[06:34:56] <seutje> I don't understand the problem, you've set a global handler with ajaxsetup, so if u set a handler in that specific request, it overrides the global, doesn't it?
[06:35:24] <sess> nope
[06:35:27] <sess> the global always runs
[06:35:38] <sess> if i add a .fail(), both runs
[06:36:26] <seutje> is this where I start guessing how you set up the global handler?
[06:37:00] <sess> [15:33] <        sess> | which is normally handled by $(document).ajaxError
[06:37:32] <seutje> oh, "normally" is "shit I've set up myself"
[06:37:33] <sess> anyways I found a way to disable it, and I'll solve this by returning null instead of throwing an error so it works out
[06:38:00] <sess> seutje: I didn't mean normally as in how people do it in general - i meant as in how errors are normally handled by the application
[06:38:16] <seutje> I give up
[06:38:19] <seutje> code or gtfo
[06:38:22] <sess> I thought that was obvious since I pasted code......
[06:38:55] <seutje> moar dots!
[06:39:17] <sess> I give up
[06:40:10] <|RicharD|> How I can know when the scrollbar reach a div ?
[06:40:24] <|RicharD|> I'm trying with .scrollTop etc…but i'm going crazy with the formula
[06:40:26] <seutje> `api offset
[06:40:26] <b-ot> seutje: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[06:40:36] <seutje> `api position
[06:40:36] <b-ot> seutje: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[06:44:58] <BillCriswell> |RicharD|: There's a plugin called "waypoints" that can make that very easy for you (http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/). If you're just doing it for a single div it's $('div').offset().top >= $(window).scrollTop() on a scroll event.
[06:45:16] <|RicharD|> I tried with waypoints
[06:45:26] <|RicharD|> but often not works well when I have multiple div
[06:46:14] <BillCriswell> I imagine you were doing something strange then.
[06:47:27] <|RicharD|> you think it's a my problem ?
[06:48:23] <BillCriswell> Yeah, with the way you were approaching the situation.
[06:48:58] <|RicharD|> I'm creating
[06:49:05] <|RicharD|> multiple .waypoint
[06:49:13] <|RicharD|> for every div
[06:54:33] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to change image in a div when clicking on another image, but i am not getting the desired result. Almost works, but it applies same image to all elements http://jsfiddle.net/vJW4c/4/
[06:56:37] <pingo> What is a good way to select an element which has a div with id="foo" as a child?
[06:57:15] <pingo> And I cannot select the "div#foo" first
[06:57:51] <pingo> Hmm maybe with $.grep
[06:58:03] <BillCriswell> |RicharD|: http://jsbin.com/sugoh/1/edit?html,css,js,output Does this help? The actual JS is at the bottom below the minifeid waypoint source.
[06:58:09] <Cork> pingo: don't use elements infront of id's
[06:58:23] <Cork> you are throwing a way the id's selector speed
[06:58:51] <BillCriswell> pingo: $('#foo').parent()
[06:58:56] <|RicharD|> BillCriswell: not works
[06:59:27] <Cork> uh, why wouldn't that work?
[06:59:52] <pingo> Cork ah, didnt know that, and I even thought I was "helping the engine" :D
[06:59:53] <BillCriswell> |RicharD|: http://jsbin.com/sugoh/3/edit?html,css,js,output It works, here it is a bit more obvious.
[07:00:13] <Cork> pingo: instead of looking in the id has for the element
[07:00:24] <Cork> pingo: you are looping over the doom searching for all divs
[07:00:33] <Cork> and then from that list filters to the one with the id
[07:00:40] <|RicharD|> Ok now yes
[07:01:11] <pingo> Cork are there any good articles on DOs and DONTs for selectors?
[07:01:29] <Cork> pingo: it is the same rules as is correct for css
[07:01:35] <BillCriswell> It was before yes too. :-p
[07:01:43] <Cork> except the jquery :<function> calls is slow
[07:02:04] <Cork> in addition to the normal css rules
[07:02:23] <pingo> will look into that then
[07:02:27] <Cork> pingo: but you want to be as specific as possible on the left, and with as few rules as you can make it on the right
[07:02:41] <pingo> got it
[07:03:08] <pingo> so basically, IDs everywhere is performant ?
[07:03:13] <Cork> so id > class > element > attribute > jquery filter functions (like :contains, :first and so on)
[07:03:30] <Cork> pingo: classes is almost as fast as id's
[07:03:52] <Cork> but ya element names infront of id's is pointless
[07:03:57] <BillCriswell> pingo: You probably really shouldn't be worrying about this till you have to worry about it.
[07:04:15] <Cork> BillCriswell: some part of it is worth thinking about
[07:04:35] <Cork> there are some basic rules that is always good to have as rules for how you write css
[07:04:47] <Cork> but ya, full optimization is something else
[07:06:05] <BillCriswell> Cork: True.
[07:06:20] <krambiorix> i'm using block ui for its overlay: $.blockUI({ overlayCSS: { backgroundColor: 'transparent' },message: '<div><img src="../images/loader.gif"/>', })  ->in firebug i can see that it exists but on screen i can't.... anyone?
[07:06:48] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You should close that <div>
[07:07:19] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, doesn't help :s
[07:08:30] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Is the element just hidden?
[07:09:37] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes, i see display:none
[07:10:07] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, $.blockUI({ overlayCSS: { backgroundColor: 'transparent' },message: '<div><img src="../images/loader.gif"/>', })    should make it show, no?
[07:10:34] <BillCriswell> I have no idea.
[07:10:58] <shoky> you've definitely been here long enough to have been told at least 200 times .. j s f i d d l e
[07:11:16] <krambiorix> you're right shoky
[07:11:35] <krambiorix> sry
[07:12:07] <shoky> it's ok.. just.. would be nice if you remember it
[07:13:15] <BillCriswell> Half the time people figure things out on their own when they make the fiddle first.
[07:14:41] <ElDiabolo> Hi. If I want a single select list without a scrollbar, what is the better option: Modify a jquery-ui selectable to single select or use a  select list bo?
[07:15:11] <ElDiabolo> s/bo/box/
[07:15:38] <krambiorix> shoky, will do
[07:16:01] <airdem> ElDiabolo, why do you have a scrollbar? too many option elements in it?
[07:16:56] <airdem> is the scrollbar vertical or horizontal? please be more specific
[07:16:59] <ElDiabolo> airdem, I want to be sure not to have a scroll bar if there are too many elements. Best would be if the list would resize.
[07:17:16] <airdem> did you set a css height for select?
[07:18:00] <airdem> maybe you should check out the "overflow" css option
[07:18:21] <ElDiabolo> airdem, I did not try a select yet, just found that a jquery-ui selectable is not that easy to handle.
[07:18:30] <BillCriswell> ElDiabolo: So like... you want the text to squeeze into the available height?
[07:18:58] <airdem> ElDiabolo, if you want to do fancy js stuff, google for select2, it's sexy :)
[07:21:26] <ElDiabolo> BillCriswell, No, I would prefer the box to get larger.
[07:22:35] <PatBatem1n> any idea with the error message: Caution provisional headers are shown ?
[07:22:46] <PatBatem1n> I post a form with ajax
[07:43:14] <ankurk> Can I exclude a span from selectors?
[07:43:46] <jedimind> :not()
[07:43:49] <jedimind> :not(span)
[07:47:29] <Marlon_> hi people, don't suppose anyone is up for helping me out of a ie11 issue regarding jquery 1.11 and jquery ui 1.10.4
[07:50:52] <ankurk> jedimind thanks!
[07:51:06] <jedimind> np
[07:52:50] <ankurk> I am trying to get the text from td but not from span, but it's not working, var on_air_critical = $(this_button).closest('tr').find('td:nth-child(7) :not(span)').text();
[07:56:30] <CrysAk> Help! I'm posting an object via jquery $.post, it;s storing the object fine with 2 keys and 2 values, however when it gets to the next php step it's only keeping the last key/value and losing any other key/values it had
[07:56:50] <CrysAk> how do i convert and object to an array for us in a .post?
[07:56:52] <CrysAk> wow...
[07:57:05] <BillCriswell> You scared everyone away
[07:57:15] <CrysAk> not suprised :(
[07:58:21] <jedimind> tsk tsk
[07:58:25] <BillCriswell> ankurk: It's kind of a pain in the ass to do that. I'd change my approach, if you can't you would need to use .contents() and .filter() to check the nodeType. Like... $('td').contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType === 3; }).text()
[07:58:48] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: You'd just have to loop through it.
[07:59:01] <BillCriswell> ankurk: http://jsbin.com/gamid/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:59:11] <CrysAk> BillCriswell, loop through the POST[] ?
[07:59:51] <ankurk> BillCriswell: I am changing the text in td essentially but I don't want to change the span
[08:00:12] <BillCriswell> ankurk: It's alot easier to just wrap the text you actually want to change in a span.
[08:00:52] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: Do you have a jsobject like { name: "Foo", age: "Bar" } and you want that in a format .post can take?
[08:01:35] <CrysAk> BillCriswell,  it;s currently in the format of [0], [1]
[08:01:49] <CrysAk> and i want that to be converted to array key/values
[08:03:23] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: So you have an array of arrays?
[08:04:13] <CrysAk> um.
[08:05:28] <CrysAk> no i have an object in Jquery , for example, 0-12, 13-15, 5-55   and i want that to be converted into an array in php with key 0 - value 12, key 13,... wait this isn;t going to wrok :/
[08:06:09] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: So [ '0-12', '13-15', '5-55' ] ?
[08:06:26] <CrysAk> yea but i might have duplicate keys with differnt values :/
[08:06:34] <CrysAk> for example 0-12, 0-14
[08:07:13] <BillCriswell> So you just want that array passed to PHP basically?
[08:07:24] <CrysAk> yup, but can you have duplicate keys in an array?
[08:07:42] <CrysAk> or an array with 1 keya dn 2 values?
[08:07:52] <jphase> the value would be an array
[08:08:00] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: No. You can have an array without the keys though.
[08:08:04] <CrysAk> so ana rray in an array :/
[08:08:09] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: You can have a key with two values yes.
[08:09:01] <CrysAk> i'l get around it don;t worry
[08:09:10] <CrysAk> but yea,m how to get that object over to php as an array
[08:10:03] <ankurk> BillCriswell: I exactly did that now
[08:10:13] <ankurk> Thanks man!
[08:10:31] <BillCriswell> You'd need the variable you pass to post to look like [ { name: "items[]", value: "12-34" }, { name: "items[]", value: "12-14" } ]
[08:10:44] <CrysAk> BillCriswell, yea that's fine :)
[08:10:49] <CrysAk> then get the info out later in php
[08:10:59] <BillCriswell> Then you could access those in PHP like foreach( $_POST['items'] as $item ){}
[08:11:50] <airdem> CrysAk, you can convert array or objects to json and send them via ajax to php
[08:12:02] <airdem> and php has functions to covnert json back to arrays, etc
[08:12:14] <CrysAk> got a link or somethign that explains this or a temrn to lookupo?
[08:12:23] <airdem> json
[08:12:24] <airdem> :)
[08:12:31] <BillCriswell> json_encode and json_decode
[08:12:34] <CrysAk> oh, ha thanks
[08:12:42] <CrysAk> love love, be back when i havea  headache ^^
[08:13:14] <airdem> CrysAk,  most of the time youll get answers by just asking google like: "how can i sedn data from javascript to php"
[08:13:17] <airdem> just saying.
[08:14:52] <CrysAk> airdem yea i know that's what I;'ve been doing while building the site :P jsut occasionally i misunderstand how something works and end up here where you lovely people set me straight ^^
[08:15:11] <airdem> CrysAk, i do that too. no shame in that :)
[08:15:19] * airdem hopes so
[08:16:35] <BillCriswell> ankurk: No problem!
[08:17:08] <CrysAk> could never of built the site if it wern't for everyone on here and #php ^^
[08:18:00] <airdem> maybe mention "us" on the end of your page. lol
[08:18:00] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: Yeha. I learned a lot on IRC as well.
[08:18:12] <airdem> *at
[08:18:43] <CrysAk> haha, website doesn;t even have my name on it :P want it to be as clean as possible but I;m forever recommending these 2 channles ^^
[08:18:54] <CrysAk> that being said needs some css work atm :S
[08:19:18] <BillCriswell> To move to a standing desk or not... Hmmm
[08:19:42] <CrysAk> ha, met a French guy recently who says he can;t work without a standing desk.. didn;t think it was a common thing!
[08:20:59] <BillCriswell> They're all over the place nowadays. Not sure when they became popular.
[08:22:50] <airdem> wish i had one
[08:23:09] <airdem> even better, a hybrid desk
[08:23:28] <BillCriswell> I need to go all in or I'll bail.
[08:23:34] <airdem> or convertable, whatever its called
[08:23:48] <airdem> good luck BillCriswell

[08:28:19] <|RicharD|> anyway was only on jsfiddle
[08:28:31] <|RicharD|> it isn't the real code html/js
[08:29:30] <airdem> "I tried, but only works with the first div."
[08:29:37] <airdem> it works for the last 2 divs for me
[08:29:54] <airdem> if you mean the alert()
[08:31:30] <|RicharD|> airdem: oh you have right, I don't have simulated

[08:34:27] <|RicharD|> airdem: you
[08:34:30] <|RicharD|> ops
[08:39:27] <mehwork> in jquery mobile if i assign a click handler , it pauses a second on mobile devices but it doesn't pause if i use a tap handler instead. But i need it to work on both mobile and desktop, so do I have to create a conditional that does the tap on mobile, else the click?
[08:40:31] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/2WZhv/1/
[08:41:22] <duch_kazatel> mehwork yes - you need to do feature detection to handle the different events.
[08:42:02] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix - $.blockUI isn't loaded into that fiddle afaik
[08:42:36] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, well i have the same thing here and it doesn't work too
[08:42:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/2WZhv/2/
[08:42:50] <duch_kazatel> if you reference the blockUI plugin, it works fine.
[08:43:15] <krambiorix> hmmm
[08:48:20] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel,  i can't make it work with this setup http://jsfiddle.net/2WZhv/3/
[08:51:41] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix http://jsfiddle.net/2WZhv/4/
[08:51:46] <duch_kazatel> works jkust fine when you include the plugin.
[08:51:58] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix make sure your selectors are working.
[08:52:31] <BillCriswell> jquery-ui !== blockUI
[08:52:32] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, when i remove my function calls it works
[08:52:54] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix clarify
[08:53:08] <duch_kazatel> "when i remove my function calls" - you meant he saveAll and saveOthers?
[08:53:12] <duch_kazatel> s/he/the
[08:53:19] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, yes
[08:54:06] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix any errors in the console
[08:54:06] <duch_kazatel> ?
[08:54:49] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, no errors. When those functions (saveAll, saveOthers) have been executed, the blockui works ... :s
[08:55:01] <duch_kazatel> not following.
[08:55:45] <CrysAk> Hmm.. why is the alert on line.10 working but not on line.12 ? http://paste.ofcode.org/38gfaEaDF66GfMhgksjd4DX
[08:55:47] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, ok so my code is like in the jsfiddle, first i put the blockui and then my function calls
[08:55:52] <CrysAk> says it is undefined on line 12 :/
[08:56:24] <duch_kazatel> CrysAk because make_model_string only exists within that function.  define it in the parent scope first.
[08:56:33] <krambiorix> it works when 1) i remove my function calls after the blockui call    2) when i don't remove the calls the blockui is being executed after the functions are executed...
[08:56:42] <CrysAk> duch_kazatel, thanks, how do i defined it without assigning anything to it?
[08:56:53] <duch_kazatel> var make_model_string;
[08:57:02] <CrysAk> ta
[08:57:09] <duch_kazatel> put that at the top and remove it from within the function.
[08:57:37] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix huh?  you said it wasn't working, now you're saying it's working in a different order?
[08:57:42] <CrysAk> so how would i go about ensureing "," is only placed between values?
[08:57:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:58:32] <CrysAk> i need to append with "," seperating the values
[08:58:45] <CrysAk> but i don;t want to start or end with a "," so i can convert to ana rray easier in php later
[08:58:58] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, now i see that the blockui appears after the functions have been executed
[08:59:03] <krambiorix> it should be before
[08:59:48] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[08:59:50] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:00:29] <CrysAk> nvm, got it ^^
[09:00:30] <cadz> hi anyone here?
[09:00:36] <CrysAk> it;s still undefined but the varable exsists
[09:00:43] <cadz> can somebody read this? i have problem with irc
[09:00:44] <duch_kazatel> back
[09:01:10] <cadz> can somebody read this? i have problem with irc
[09:01:16] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, you understand my problem?
[09:01:18] <duch_kazatel> cadz I can.
[09:01:19] <krambiorix> cadz -> yes
[09:01:21] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix now I do.
[09:01:38] <cadz> thanks guys. Can i post a stackoverflow question of mine here?
[09:01:45] <cadz> i mean give a link
[09:01:45] <duch_kazatel> `ask @ cadz
[09:01:50] <duch_kazatel> `ask
[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> wtf the bot it broken.
[09:01:56] <cadz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21734180/can-i-declare-javascript-repeatedly-in-a-loop
[09:02:28] <cadz> can somebody check that link and see if you can help. I'll really appreaciate it thanks http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21734180/can-i-declare-javascript-repeatedly-in-a-loop
[09:02:29] <foo> screen -x
[09:02:33] <foo> haha, disregard.
[09:03:02] <duch_kazatel> cadz can you post a JSfiddle that demonstrates?
[09:03:10] <motaka2> hello let's say I have $("keyup".".selector" , function(){...}) in a $.fn.SomePlugin  . in keyup event $(this) points to document?
[09:03:17] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, do you have any suggestion?
[09:03:26] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix not sure how to help you at this point.
[09:03:32] <cadz> duch_kazatel: I cant, it's like posting the whole web application
[09:03:48] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 did you try to console.log($(this)); inside that function?
[09:03:54] <cadz> duch_kazatel: How di i even jsfiddle a calling of a template
[09:04:44] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yes and the result is yes
[09:04:59] <duch_kazatel> cadz you jsfiddle the smallest example possible - break the problem down as far as you can.  the issue with your question is it looks like you're declaring vars inside functions and then trying to access them from outside.
[09:04:59] <motaka2> and I wonder why
[09:05:26] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 $("keyup".".selector" , function(){...}) looks wrong to my eyes.  you sure that's the actual coide?
[09:05:29] <duch_kazatel> s/coide/code
[09:06:28] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yes just replace the first. a typo
[09:06:49] <cadz> duch_kazatel: but it's not illegal or does it have no side effect on declaring a javascript (inside a script tag repeatedly)?
[09:07:09] <duch_kazatel> "declaring a javascript" - what does this mean?
[09:07:30] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 that still looks wrong - regular event binding looks more like $(document).on('keyup', '.child', function(){});
[09:08:29] <cadz> duch_kazatel: sorry i'm poor in programming terms. How do you call a $('.clue_tip').cluetip({  splitTitle: '|'}); ?
[09:08:30] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: yes, mine is also the same, you are right I wanted to give a quick example
[09:08:51] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 that would explain it.  you are detecting on the document.
[09:08:53] <cadz> i mean what do you call a $('.clue_tip').cluetip({  splitTitle: '|'}); ? isnt it declaring a javascript?
[09:09:33] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: so how can I access the object over which the event happned $(e.target) ?
[09:09:46] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 can you supply some sample code?
[09:10:07] <duch_kazatel> cadz $('.clue_tip').cluetip({  splitTitle: '|'}); isn't "declaring a javascript".  that sentence has no meaning.  you're making a method call.
[09:10:13] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: wait
[09:10:55] <duch_kazatel> for everybody needing help, make sure you're starting with this guide: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:11:08] <cadz> duch_kazatel: okay thanks mate, so is it wrong to repeatedly call a method through a loop?
[09:11:22] <duch_kazatel> cadz not necessarily.  depends on what it does.
[09:12:09] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: there you go, https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8959964 search for keyup , they way the code is right now works fine.I was just wondering why $(this) didn't work and you explained me the reason
[09:12:14] <decx> fixing 'these' jquery. is that real english or tongue in cheek?
[09:12:26] <decx> hello btw
[09:12:39] <duch_kazatel> decx I think it might be tongue in cheek.  it's a good guide either way.
[09:12:43] <cadz> duch_kazatel: if i put that method inside document.ready function, will it take effect on all the elements inside the page? including pages that is being called through a loop but basically part of the main page?
[09:12:44] <duch_kazatel> and good morning.
[09:13:13] <duch_kazatel> cadz it will only work on whatever is all ready on the page when you run it.
[09:13:39] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 ah.  yeah, it's going to be the document in that case it looks like.
[09:14:30] <cadz> duch_kazatel: will the document.ready function wait for the looping of pages inside the page it is called?
[09:14:36] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: thx, I hope untill finsishing the code you will be here to give me over all comments, now it is full of bugs. thx for you care
[09:14:41] <duch_kazatel> cadz document.ready only waits for the document to be ready.
[09:14:44] <duch_kazatel> that's all it does.
[09:15:03] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 i may not be able to help you very much.  i have a job too ;)
[09:15:40] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: thx anyway. happy developping
[09:15:40] <cadz> duch_kazatel: how to know if the document is ready?
[09:15:57] <duch_kazatel> cadz not sure what you mean.  document ready tells you its ready.
[09:17:10] <cadz> duch_kazatel: i mean, how to test the readyness of the document, because for me, document.ready should wait for my looped pages to finish first to be able to call itself as ready which is why name him document.ready in the first place.
[09:17:43] <duch_kazatel> cadz there should be some kind of success callback you can put your code in.
[09:17:44] <cadz> duch_kazatel: i hope im making sense here. I'm really confused about this document.ready, i thought i know this
[09:17:49] <duch_kazatel> I'm not familiar with any of the libs or frameworks.
[09:18:01] <duch_kazatel> *any of the libs or frameworks you're using, other than jquery, that is.
[09:18:08] <duch_kazatel> but your questions are very... strange.
[09:18:33] <cadz> duch_kazatel: because my problem is very.. strange. sorry
[09:18:33] <duch_kazatel> cadz I'd really suggest checking out the guide I posted earlier.
[09:18:34] <bdoherty> duck_kazatel, do you happen to be at jQuery Con at the moment?
[09:18:49] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty hah, nope.
[09:18:54] <duch_kazatel> wish I was though!
[09:19:06] <duch_kazatel> wait which one?
[09:19:11] <bdoherty> San Diego
[09:19:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah, nope.
[09:19:30] <bdoherty> they are giving the key note now, would of been cool to meet the dude who just hangs out in IRC all day helping people.
[09:19:47] <duch_kazatel> hah.  i'm not the only one that hangs out in here.
[09:19:55] <duch_kazatel> plus I'm just a cranky wiseass ;)
[09:20:02] <bdoherty> well, most visible over the past 2 days to me atleast
[09:20:12] <bdoherty> plus, you helped with my performance question the other day
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> i's a pleasure to help folks in here, tbh.
[09:20:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel is pretty talkative.
[09:20:26] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell is actually smart.
[09:20:50] <duch_kazatel> think of me as your rubber duck for problem solving.
[09:20:57] <mehwork> duch_kazatel: actually, instead of detecting what device i'm on i was able to just do: .on('tap click'
[09:21:06] <duch_kazatel> mehwork that's another way to do it.
[09:21:12] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i have this code on my computer... http://jsfiddle.net/2WZhv/3/           -> the blockui is shown after the functions are called -> any idea?
[09:21:14] <BillCriswell> I think it only seems that way due to the caliber of question typically asked in here duch_kazatel.
[09:22:07] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: I feel like you left out a part of that question.
[09:23:06] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hah.  don't sell yourself short.
[09:23:16] <duch_kazatel> i do need to hit up a conf. at some point though.  any popular ones?
[09:23:23] <duch_kazatel> or good ones?
[09:23:43] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, me too but that's all
[09:24:28] <krambiorix> so when i click my button, my functions (saveAll and saveOthers) are being executed and THEN i see my blockui overlay
[09:25:12] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, any any idea?
[09:25:30] <bdoherty> duch_kazatel, I'm only 20 minutes into this jQuery one, and so far so good.
[09:25:42] <bdoherty> I also enjoyed Future Insights Live in vegas
[09:25:55] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: That's how it should be happening. Look at blockUI for what to do on a confirm or cancel and call it in there.
[09:26:51] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: There's an onUnblock event. That seems like when you want your other functions to be called?
[09:26:52] <GoSox> I'm trying to select a div inside a fieldset when the legend is clicked on, i'm not sure how to do it
[09:26:55] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/DRepD/1/
[09:27:00] <cadz> If i put a document.ready inside my main page, then inside that main page i am looping a template which displays divs, will document.ready wait for that loop to execute all its function inside?
[09:27:23] <duch_kazatel> GoSox https://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[09:27:34] <duch_kazatel> cadz probably not.
[09:27:49] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, how do you mean?
[09:27:58] <BillCriswell> GoSox: $(this).next('div') I think is what you're looking for?
[09:28:55] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:28:59] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/2WZhv/5/ I *think* this is what you need?
[09:29:41] <GoSox> so I tried .siblings( ) but it doesn't seem to be working?
[09:29:42] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/DRepD/3/
[09:30:19] <BillCriswell> GoSox: Didn't include jQuery.
[09:30:26] <GoSox> oh crap
[09:30:41] <GoSox> there we go! thanks
[09:30:48] <BillCriswell> .siblings('div') would select all siblings divs. You may just want $(this).next().slideDown('fast');
[09:31:04] <GoSox> there will only ever be one sibling div
[09:31:11] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[09:31:59] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes almost but the second function isn't executed
[09:32:44] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: There there's something going on in .saveAll()
[09:33:06] <BillCriswell> Are you sure you mean to be called $el.someFunction(), did you create these plugins?
[09:33:14] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes
[09:33:43] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, just to be clear: i want first to show the blockui then call all functions and then hide the blockui
[09:34:41] <GoSox> purrrrrrrrrfect
[09:34:42] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/DRepD/6/
[09:35:37] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Ok.
[09:36:03] <BillCriswell> What does .saveAll() and .saveOthers() return?
[09:39:28] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, nothing
[09:39:45] <BillCriswell> So they're done instantly?
[09:40:35] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yeah
[09:40:48] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, well, in there, there are ajax calls
[09:40:56] <krambiorix> so i guess no on the previous question
[09:41:17] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix there's your problem.  you need to define a success callback mechanism./
[09:43:23] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, hmm with the code that BillCriswell provided, i see no difference. The ajax call in saveAll is not performed
[09:43:53] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix do those functions depends on one another in some way?
[09:43:59] <duch_kazatel> does one need to happen before the other?
[09:44:12] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, nope
[09:46:57] <krambiorix> i think i got it
[09:53:18] <petey> Hey guys, I think I figured out one of my issues, but now I am trying to figure out how to loop through the data
[09:53:19] <petey> http://jsbin.com/wixit/1/edit
[09:54:11] <petey> running a console.log on the json gets me an Object > Object1..99: Object > each attribute
[09:55:49] <MariusIT> how can I get UL height "console.log($( '.ul' ).height());" ? UL is not defined as a class or divID
[09:56:04] <petey> http://imgur.com/h3p5jkj
[09:56:15] <petey> No idea how to loop through that though
[09:56:33] <duch_kazatel> MariusIT .ul is class="ul".  remove the period.
[09:56:38] <ryanneufeld> petey: if you're using ids you don't need to have .popup
[09:56:50] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel: that's an example
[09:57:02] <ryanneufeld> petey: also, what's your HTML look like?
[09:57:10] <GoSox> check out the fieldsets on this page! they came out perfect!
[09:57:11] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/http-headers/
[09:57:11] <petey> ryannuefeld one sec
[09:57:11] <duch_kazatel> $( 'ul' ).height() will get you the height of a UL.
[09:57:18] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @petey
[09:57:41] <Tomashe> Hey guys how can i select item from selectbox?
[09:57:45] <Tomashe> object.find('[name="type"]')....
[09:57:47] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel: returns 30 .... same on li ... o_O
[09:57:58] <ryanneufeld> Tomashe: see ?api :selected
[09:58:01] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel: i need the hight as defined in body
[09:58:09] <ryanneufeld> ?selected
[09:58:11] <Tomashe> selected? i dont want to find selected
[09:58:21] <Tomashe> i want to select an option using jquery
[09:58:33] <duch_kazatel> MariusIT huh?  could you setup a quick fiddle?
[09:58:35] <beachandbytes> petey, http://jsbin.com/wixit/3/edit
[09:58:36] <ryanneufeld> oh, find that item, and set the selected property
[09:58:43] <ryanneufeld> Tomashe: ^^
[09:58:47] <Tomashe> hmm
[09:59:02] <Tomashe> object.find('[name="type"]') ??
[09:59:09] <Tomashe> how do i find an item by its value?
[09:59:09] <petey> http://plnkr.co/edit/5KMVwaLxHfTZLPvcoXuV?p=info
[09:59:21] <petey> ryanneufeld
[09:59:30] <petey> beachandbytes checking it out now! thanks
[09:59:38] <Tomashe> object.find('[name="type"]').find('option[value="x"]) ?
[09:59:39] <Tomashe> like that?
[10:00:02] <petey> beachandbytes my problem was that id = window.location.hash.substring(1) was returning undefined
[10:00:34] <MariusIT> duch_kazatel
[10:00:35] <MariusIT> http://jsfiddle.net/47rma/
[10:00:56] <ryanneufeld> petey: so what is it you're trying to do?
[10:01:05] <beachandbytes> petey, very possible if there is no #something on the end of the url
[10:01:40] <petey> beachandbytes and that is the case
[10:01:53] <petey> ryanneufeld I want to loop through that floor.data.js
[10:02:06] <ryanneufeld> okay, then use a for loop
[10:02:07] <beachandbytes> that, each item I added will do just that
[10:02:23] <beachandbytes> ryanneufeld, its an object not an array
[10:02:27] <ryanneufeld> beachandbytes: yeah
[10:02:30] <ryanneufeld> and that changes nothing
[10:02:35] <ryanneufeld> ?mdn for in
[10:02:42] <beachandbytes> much easier to enumerate the properties of an object with $.each
[10:03:09] <duch_kazatel> beachandbytes each does impart a small performance penalty.
[10:03:10] <ryanneufeld> beachandbytes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in
[10:03:14] <ryanneufeld> petey: ^^
[10:03:30] <ryanneufeld> beachandbytes: all you're doing in that case is letting jquery do the for loop for you
[10:03:55] <ryanneufeld> beachandbytes: if you look at the colored triangle example. The function show_own_props
[10:03:58] <duch_kazatel> a standard for in is a little faster.
[10:04:12] <ryanneufeld> for (var prop in obj) {
[10:04:12] <ryanneufeld>     if( obj.hasOwnProperty( prop ) ) {
[10:04:13] <ryanneufeld>       result += objName + "." + prop + " = " + obj[prop] + "\n";
[10:04:14] <ryanneufeld>     }
[10:04:16] <ryanneufeld>   }
[10:04:18] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[10:04:22] <ryanneufeld> I don't normally do pastes like that
[10:04:27] <ryanneufeld> but that's the answer :p
[10:04:43] <beachandbytes> wow actually, your right, for is much much faster
[10:04:45] <beachandbytes> http://jsperf.com/asdasda223/4
[10:04:47] <ryanneufeld> $.each is a handy shortcut. but it' snot needed
[10:04:49] <beachandbytes> 100x
[10:04:54] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:05:02] <petey> so I tried ddoing that but no luck
[10:05:08] <petey> http://plnkr.co/edit/5KMVwaLxHfTZLPvcoXuV?p=preview
[10:05:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsperf.com/more-specfic-selectors-with-contains/3 for another example.
[10:06:49] <ryanneufeld> duch_kazatel: beachandbytes yeah, but it's still doing 100k in 0.05s
[10:06:54] <ryanneufeld> so very fast either way
[10:07:03] <duch_kazatel> aye.
[10:07:11] <duch_kazatel> $.each() has its uses.
[10:07:22] <ryanneufeld> petey: there is no .popup div
[10:07:33] <ryanneufeld> so where are you expecting the changes to take effect?
[10:18:29] <beachandbytes> peteyg, http://plnkr.co/edit/p72b7yQ0CUsxcbLY5aim?p=preview
[10:19:59] <bumbar> this doesn't work as i've imagined: var el = $(this); $(el + ' a').click(function() {...});
[10:20:04] <bumbar> how should i be doing this?
[10:20:34] <NoiseEee> el.on('click','a',function() { //an <a> element within el was clicked })
[10:22:32] <petey> ryanneufeld sorry I was away, I didn't realize this code was so jacked up. It isn't mine unfortunately
[10:22:34] <petey> well, fortunately it isnt mine
[10:22:36] <petey> but anyway I need to loop through that stuff and perhaps append a new field
[10:22:40] <petey> I need all the results to show up
[10:22:42] <petey> instead of just the last one, like .html does
[10:24:16] <drager> I'm having a problem with caching an event from an anchor tag I'm creating with jQuery. I can add it to the DOM from the html file and it will work but hm well... I want to add it using javascript.
[10:24:20] <drager> Ideas?
[10:24:24] <drager> catching*
[10:24:41] <Tomashe> i found out there is few ways to select a selectbox option , prop('selected', true) and attr('selected',true) which is the rigth way
[10:25:02] <duch_kazatel> drager i'll bet you're doing something like $('a').on('click', function(){}); in your code before you add it, yeah?
[10:25:05] <beachandbytes> drager, make sure your waiting for the dom to become ready before attaching the event
[10:25:09] <logikos> suppose i had a script that was appending some '<script src="/some/src/here.js"></script>'  to <head> ... the browser would go fetch that file of course, but i have another script that depends on the browser haveing that file already, is there a way to know when the file is loaded?
[10:25:19] <drager> duch_kazatel: True
[10:25:26] <drager> but I dont know how to solve that
[10:25:32] <logikos> kinda like $(document).ready() does for the entire document, but in this case for a specific external file that was not there on page load?
[10:25:44] <drager> since I have that onclick in Class
[10:25:50] <duch_kazatel> drager use event delegation instead.  $('parent').on('click', 'a', function(){});
[10:26:04] <duch_kazatel> where parent is a parent element that exists on pageload.
[10:26:58] <beachandbytes> logikos, use getscript and put the rest of your js in the callback
[10:27:42] <drager> duch_kazatel: Will test that. THanks
[10:27:59] <duch_kazatel> drager read up on .on() and events and delegation.  it'll help you out.
[10:28:39] <logikos> beachandbytes: is there a way for getscript() to know if the script file is already loaded? right now i'm doing: if (!$("script[src='" + src + "']").length) {          $('<script src="' + src + '">').appendTo("head");        }
[10:28:49] <logikos> so that way it only adds the scrip tag to the head if its not already there
[10:29:06] <logikos> because its likley that several things will call for the dependency
[10:29:46] <NoiseEee> logikos: you can look into http://requirejs.org/
[10:30:59] <petey> Hi guys, sorry I had to step away for a sec. So now I get the last item in the list to load into floor.data.js
[10:30:59] <petey> http://plnkr.co/edit/5KMVwaLxHfTZLPvcoXuV?p=preview
[10:31:11] <petey> The thing is, I need that whole thing to loop over itself and display all the results
[10:31:31] <bumbar> NoiseEee, thanks
[10:33:02] <logikos> NoiseEee: thats a big file just to check if a js file exists before loading it..
[10:33:14] <NoiseEee> logikos: as a general concept.
[10:33:31] <logikos> http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.10/comments/require.js
[10:34:03] <_pingu> search for a plugin to make a fixed footer bar. it should hold informations about the things the user had last done. for instance: saved object x, deleted object y... . some of the informations should appear at mouseover ... . . ca somebody recommend something?
[10:34:08] <NoiseEee> logikos: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/
[10:42:38] <beachandbytes> petey, http://plnkr.co/edit/p72b7yQ0CUsxcbLY5aim?p=preview
[10:47:06] <petey> Ah yay thanks beachandbytes, thats the solution I came up with too!
[10:52:58] <GoSox> i'm having more selector problems
[10:53:06] <duch_kazatel> shoot
[10:53:13] <Tomashe> Guys it seems that when i serialize the a text it gets "something+something...." there s a way to remove those "+" without removing a real "+" by user?
[10:53:48] <GoSox> I want to select all <input> elements that are contained within $(this) 's parent <div>, but possibly several levels deep, so not necessarily a sibling
[10:54:20] <duch_kazatel> .find() is your friend.
[10:54:21] <Tomashe> so do $(this).parent().parent().parent().find("input") ?
[10:54:33] <Tomashe> go back as much as u want and search
[10:54:36] <duch_kazatel> $(this).parent('div').find('input')
[10:54:53] <duch_kazatel> or use https://api.jquery.com/parents/
[10:55:00] <duch_kazatel> if you have a class or ID.
[10:55:01] <Tomashe> duch , can u help me now
[10:55:02] <Tomashe> ?
[10:55:03] <Tomashe> :)
[10:55:12] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe have a fiddle demonstrating the proble,m?
[10:55:34] <Tomashe> not really
[10:55:51] <duch_kazatel> could you try explaining it then?
[10:55:53] <Tomashe> lets say u got a input and u write some text, then serialize it
[10:56:00] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[10:56:14] <Tomashe> so u got for example name=text+text+text+text if the text contain spaces
[10:56:28] <Tomashe> so i want to remove those "+" and leave them as spaces
[10:56:42] <duch_kazatel> then serialize is not what you want.
[10:56:45] <Tomashe> but what if the user actually input "+"
[10:56:52] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:56:56] <Tomashe> ok , there is another way?
[10:57:12] <duch_kazatel> why are you seralizing the form?
[10:57:16] <duch_kazatel> or the input?
[10:57:16] <GoSox> is there something like a reverse of .find('something') ? something that will search UP the tree, and stop when it finds something
[10:57:31] <Tomashe> yes i am duch
[10:57:32] <beachandbytes> serialize should use & not +
[10:57:34] <duch_kazatel> GoSox yes, I pasted a link to the api docs for .parents()
[10:57:52] <Tomashe> yes using & for the elements , but for the text spaces "+"
[10:57:58] <Tomashe> so what is the suggestion?
[10:58:03] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe what are you serialiuzing the input?
[10:58:07] <duch_kazatel> i didn't ask if you were, but why.
[10:58:11] <Tomashe> yes
[10:58:17] <Tomashe> ohh
[10:58:25] <Tomashe> to send all inputs data to my api
[10:58:43] <Tomashe> i did not do it manualy like var name = input[name="...
[10:58:45] <Tomashe> and so on
[10:58:51] <Tomashe> val()
[10:59:02] <Tomashe> just wanted to catch all and move it to server
[10:59:12] <duch_kazatel> are you using a GET to send that data?
[10:59:18] <Tomashe> post
[11:00:47] <Tomashe> any alternative when im using POST
[11:00:48] <Tomashe> ?
[11:01:01] <beachandbytes> Tomashe, if a user inputs a plus it will be encoded
[11:01:05] <duch_kazatel> not unless you do it by hand.
[11:01:49] <Tomashe> ok
[11:01:50] <duch_kazatel> but the plus symbols should get encoded fine.
[11:02:14] <Tomashe> anyway looks like i got no option buy do it by hand
[11:02:15] <Tomashe> fuck
[11:02:16] <Tomashe> hehe
[11:02:17] <Tomashe> :)
[11:02:54] <duch_kazatel> uh, did you try with a plus symbol?
[11:03:21] <beachandbytes> what is your goal by removing the +'s?
[11:03:50] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe have you tried encoding a string when the user enters a + manually?
[11:04:02] <beachandbytes> serialize will do that for you
[11:04:05] <beachandbytes> automatically
[11:04:10] <Tomashe> hmm
[11:04:15] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe did you try?
[11:04:18] <Tomashe> nop
[11:04:40] <Tomashe> i will try now
[11:04:47] <duch_kazatel> why do people make these assumptions without actually trying?
[11:04:52] <duch_kazatel> what's the danger in trying?
[11:04:58] <duch_kazatel> i will never understand that.
[11:05:09] <Tomashe> i did not know manualy is a good option
[11:05:30] <duch_kazatel> testing things is a good thing.
[11:06:18] <Tomashe> worked like a charm
[11:06:53] <duch_kazatel> good. in the future, try before asking :)
[11:07:02] <Tomashe> no
[11:07:02] <duch_kazatel> don't operate off of assumptions.
[11:07:04] <Tomashe> i wont!
[11:07:07] <Tomashe> hehe j/k
[11:07:08] <Tomashe> :)
[11:07:19] <Tomashe> im always trying but this time i did not think about the possibility
[11:07:32] <Tomashe> thanks guys for help and time
[11:07:36] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[11:07:38] <duch_kazatel> s'what we do.
[11:09:24] <jkyle> I've set a 'hidden' class on a div. But when I toggle it with $("#thedivid").show() or .toggle(), it doesn't show up. I can remove the class and toggle it back and forth with hide/show in my js console.
[11:09:44] <GoSox> i'm trying to use a .change() event on a <select> but, it doens't seem to fire when you change the menu
[11:09:54] <duch_kazatel> jkyle .toggleclass() is a thing iirc.
[11:10:05] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:10:10] <jkyle> let me looki
[11:11:21] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to change an image on click with $('.foo img').attr('src', url); but now i want to do a preloader for the new image, can anyone provide me a link or something? this is what i did http://jsfiddle.net/r69qR/1/
[11:13:02] <duch_kazatel> back
[11:14:30] <drager> I'm trying to update an value in the localStorage but it will be 11 instead of 2... https://dpaste.de/XrDz
[11:20:15] <bakers>  /msg MemoServ READ NEW
[11:23:14] <duch_kazatel> augh IE's caching finally caught up to me.
[11:30:48] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: cachebust ALL the things! :D
[11:31:00] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta seriously
[11:31:38] <jkyle> I may be doing this totally wrong, but it appears in my console like jquery's show/hide and .css("tag", "value") is not modifying state
[11:31:45] <jkyle> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8962811
[11:32:59] <Velveeta> well that's just kinda weird
[11:33:21] <duch_kazatel> jkyle and there's only ONE #first-container ?
[11:33:47] <jkyle> let me verify
[11:33:54] <jkyle> yes
[11:34:28] <duch_kazatel> bbiab lunch
[11:34:42] <jkyle> oddly, I can use document.getElementById to set display and it does change state, but when I set display to block or inline it still doesn't actually show up
[11:35:00] <Velveeta> hahahaha a coworker just showed me this xkcd :D http://xkcd.com/221/
[11:35:30] <Jattenalle> Velveeta, well it's not wrong
[11:35:55] <Velveeta> it made me actually laugh out loud :D
[11:40:46] <BillCriswell> I hope this is the real Snowmageddon.
[11:53:08] <Jattenalle> so, anyone in here mind going over some code of mine and point out potential pitfalls in my jquery usage? the code runs as expected, no problems there... it's also for an ingame UI, so it does not run in a browser.. again just looking for someone to have a look at the code itself and tell me if im doing anything stupid
[11:56:45] <Jattenalle> the code in question for anyone who feels like taking a look http://gaicdn.com/v/
[12:05:16] <bashusr> hi all, i'm trying to find a library... I'm looking for something that implements "toggle panels" on this page http://jsbin.com/eqape but allows me to resize the panels
[12:05:21] <bashusr> any ideas for something like that?
[12:05:28] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Nothing jumping out at me really.
[12:05:48] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, so at least im not butchering the intended way to use jquery horribly?
[12:06:28] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Don't think so.
[12:06:39] <Jattenalle> well thanks for taking a look :)
[12:06:43] <Jattenalle> i appreciate it
[12:07:28] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:08:08] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: You can do $('#someInput').val() over $('#someInput')[0].value, but we're talking very minimal stuff.
[12:08:20] <Jattenalle> oh, i had no idea
[12:08:25] <buddyq> Velveeta: hey there
[12:08:37] <Jattenalle> i've forgotten that [0] so many times, so that'd certainly help
[12:09:44] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Haha.
[12:10:38] <Jattenalle> one thing im a bit confused about is when it's .prop() and when it's .attr()
[12:10:48] <Jattenalle> im sure there's some logical distinction, but i just dont see it :/
[12:11:32] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Yeah, it gets pretty weird to me.

[12:13:29] <Jattenalle> ooh, so basically: Shit's fucked, deal with it?
[12:13:52] <Jattenalle> so glad i dont have to deal with cross-browser support
[12:13:52] <nycjv321> Hi. I am trying to automate some java script actions via jquery. I am interacting with a drop down that triggers an event (I thought was onchange) that opens a window when I do it manually.. programmatically the page registers the change and a text is shown indicating the action was registered. The other event with the window opening does not occur... Any advice?
[12:14:29] <Jattenalle> nycjv321, show code
[12:14:34] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: I just guess normally and if something weird is going on I try the other haha. Rarely run into shit though.
[12:14:52] <BillCriswell> .prop('href') vs .attr('href') on a link with a relative URL bit me in the ass pretty good once.
[12:14:55] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, yeah that's what i've been doing.. i try one, if that gives me garbage, try the other
[12:15:15] <Jattenalle> i dont use it in too many places thankfully
[12:15:24] <Jattenalle> and the "dont care about cross-browser support" is really nice
[12:15:33] <Jattenalle> can just design everything to work in webkit and i'm golden
[12:15:36] <scorpion81> hi, got a problem with jquery 1.8.3... i try to manipulate an element from an ajax response with jquery (calling hasClass() only to check whther a certain class is there) but ODDLY... the done callback pointing to my done() function i am currently IN still hangs around somewhere and so the code being run is aborted and the callback now runs.... I dont know how to get rid of this callback again.... it prevents setting a class to a link a
[12:15:37] <scorpion81> highlighting it with css....
[12:15:52] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: http://jsbin.com/fibuk/1/edit?html,js,output found this one weird.
[12:16:55] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, oh that's just evil
[12:17:03] <scorpion81> so the problem is kind of a minimal one BUT.. still somehow annoying i cannot unbind / clear the "done" callback from within the function it executes...
[12:19:08] <scorpion81> i also can get an jqxhr from "arguments[2]" within the function, and unbind done there, or setting its responsetext to null or so, but it seems not to be the same as being executed... hmmm
[12:19:38] <scorpion81> so this doesnot work as well...
[12:22:39] <BillCriswell> scorpion81: I'd just post some code to show everyone.

[12:26:01] <nycjv321> is it possible to send microsoft js events?
[12:26:17] <duch_kazatel> nycjv321 that question doesn't make sense.
[12:26:20] <duch_kazatel> rephrase :)
[12:27:37] <nycjv321> duch_kazatel: I have a dropdown that isn't responding to my jquery events as well as my events sent through selenium webdriver. I suspect it using nonstandard windows events. I do not know how to reproduce these programmatically..
[12:28:32] <nycjv321> Manually I can select on the drop down and a window popups so there must be js going on somewhere... I have managed to get the page to awknowledge the interaction (in another event) but it does not open the window for the life of me..)
[12:29:01] <duch_kazatel> duch_b0t hello

[12:32:08] <scorpion81> BillCriswell: i am trying to "correct" this behavior by unbinding "myself" again from done() from within the function, but i cannot "reach" the external jqxhr....

[12:33:01] <HassanJ> I use a library to style selectboxes, which just works fine. However though, when I load a form via AJAX, selectboxes are not styled. (probably because it's called dynamically and not in the DOM originally)
[12:33:06] <HassanJ> What should I do?
[12:33:38] <duch_kazatel> HassanJ see if there's a way you can add things to selectboxes after your first init
[12:33:53] <HassanJ> I tried using a second parameter on the .on() function but it didn't work.
[12:33:55] <scorpion81> BillCriswell: i can get an jqxhr from inside the function via arguments[2], but i assume thats not the same instance as the calling jqxhr object...
[12:34:04] <HassanJ> duch_kazatel: ok
[12:34:54] <scorpion81> Or can i somehow get a list of which callbacks are registered where, and find the function there, and remove it ?
[12:34:57] <HassanJ> $('select').selectbox() << That applies it to all selectboxes
[12:37:41] <Asterfield> I have a jquery listener for .on('blur keypress', fn); which seems to be catching `focusout` for some reason. Any ideas?
[12:38:09] <Jattenalle> well focusout is a blur event
[12:38:44] <Asterfield> Ah okay
[12:39:15] <Jattenalle> anytime an element loses focus, regardless of how it happened = a blur
[12:40:26] <Asterfield> Jattenalle: Fair enough :) Thank you
[12:40:35] <Jattenalle> :)

[12:44:06] <duch_kazatel> yes!
[12:44:10] <duch_kazatel> the best thing,.
[12:44:35] <duch_kazatel> we reference that regularly at my job.
[12:44:38] <scorpion81> BillCriswell: How can i get an "overview" of all callback functions being registered to all active Objects ? Any idea ? so i can get rid of the "unwanted" one....
[12:45:32] <BillCriswell> scorpion81: I'm not sure. I'm kind of checked out for the day haha
[12:46:26] <duch_kazatel> "all callback functions being registered to all active objects" that sentence is the stuff nightmares are made of.
[12:47:59] <scorpion81> being inside that callback... firebug shows "this" as XMLHttpRequest Object... but i dont know where this comes from... is it the jqxhr being created on $.ajax() ? can it somehow be manipulated from inside the callback function ? or where are those XMLHttpRequests stored ? At the document ? At the Window ? somewhere they have to be.... hmmm
[12:48:29] <scorpion81> i mean being inside the jquery.js part, being triggered from hasClass()....
[12:49:33] <duch_kazatel> XMLHttpRequest objects are created by the ajax system.  what was your problem?
[12:50:38] <scorpion81>  duch_kazatel: problem was http://pastebin.com/xbhDqPtr, hasClass() there somehow triggers the done() function (a stray callback) which prevents addClass and the rest being executed
[12:51:24] <duch_kazatel> which done function?
[12:52:09] <scorpion81> duch_kazatel: i wanted to unregister the current function from the XMLHttpRequest object from inside that function... i mean the .done(function() {}) thingy after $.ajax
[12:52:38] <duch_kazatel> link.addClass('my_url_selected'); does not trigger the done callback.
[12:53:01] <duch_kazatel> at least, not by itself.
[12:53:40] <naeluh_NSA> hey I am having an issue passing my variable outside of my ajax get call ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/
[12:53:41] <scorpion81> duch_kazatel: yea, thats what i thought too... but its triggered from hasClass() already !!! there are 4 callbacks attached according to firebug, one of that .... the .done() function... So odd...
[12:54:10] <naeluh_NSA> how do I return the value outside the success
[12:54:13] <duch_kazatel> "but its triggered from hasClass() already" that statement makes no sense.  hasclass runs a check for a class.
[12:54:42] <motaka2> do methodes like parents() have a return value ?
[12:54:52] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA hoist the var declaration up to a parent scope.
[12:55:02] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 yes.  go check out the docs :)
[12:55:17] <scorpion81> duch_kazatel: yea, ok, thats the part that puzzles me, whenever i reach that line in firebug... a "sudden" callback call pops up from within jquery.js....
[12:55:31] <naeluh_NSA> I think I am doing that
[12:55:40] <duch_kazatel> scorpion81 without seeing the code, there's no way for me to know what's going on.
[12:55:50] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: I declare it outside the $.ajax
[12:55:56] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA which var?
[12:56:00] <naeluh_NSA> imgur
[12:56:14] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I am checking but when I do $curResWrap = $curInput.parents("." + confsFin.inSearchResWrapClassName); , I get an instance of $curInpute
[12:56:46] <naeluh_NSA> do I have to create a callback function or set async to false ?
[12:57:05] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA oooh you mean in that final line it's not set the way you expect?
[12:57:15] <duch_kazatel> yeah you need to put that in your callback.
[12:57:28] <naeluh_NSA> no I want the url
[12:57:37] <naeluh_NSA> yeah I am not sure how to do that ?
[12:57:46] <duch_kazatel> within the success callback.
[12:58:00] <duch_kazatel> you have to do it there.  AJAX is async - you tell it to do a thing and keep on truckin'.
[12:58:15] <naeluh_NSA> yeah but i need to get that outside too
[12:58:23] <zumba_addict> hey folks, which is better for checking server response, success, complete or done?
[12:58:31] <duch_kazatel> and it will be available outside, but you can't use it until that ajax completes.
[12:58:38] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict depends on what oyu need.
[12:58:42] <duch_kazatel> *you
[12:58:53] <zumba_addict> i did a POST and currenty chekcing 200 before I make another post
[12:59:04] <duch_kazatel> done sounds about right.
[12:59:18] <zumba_addict> ok, I'll try done. Currently it's success
[12:59:19] <zumba_addict> thanks
[12:59:32] <duch_kazatel> success won't help when it errors.
[13:00:13] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA it'll be available outside, but you have to put your code in the callback.
[13:00:20] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you have a race condition.
[13:00:50] <naeluh_NSA> ok I am not sure how to handle adding it to the callback ?
[13:01:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/PKSLj/1/
[13:01:08] <duch_kazatel> done?
[13:01:53] <naeluh_NSA> then how would I get to decalre var imgur outside of that ?
[13:02:03] <duch_kazatel> you can access it after that just fine.
[13:02:07] <duch_kazatel> it exists in the parent scope.
[13:02:22] <duch_kazatel> but it doesn't have a value until the ajax completes.
[13:02:36] <naeluh_NSA> hmm ok
[13:03:07] <duch_kazatel> before, you were dispatching an ajax event, which goes off and does its thing, and while what was running you were then trying to access that var.,
[13:03:19] <duch_kazatel> the var didn't have content because the ajax hand't completed yuet.
[13:03:22] <duch_kazatel> *yet
[13:03:37] <duch_kazatel> the only way to can satisfy that requirement is to use the callbacks.  that's why they're there.
[13:05:40] <zumba_addict> ok
[13:05:52] <naeluh_NSA> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/2/ so then this will always be undefined ?
[13:06:03] <naeluh_NSA> console.log(imgur);
[13:06:11] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:06:19] <duch_kazatel> it will only be undefined before the ajax completes.
[13:08:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/PKSLj/4/ - check out your console.
[13:08:16] <duch_kazatel> it shoes 2: before it shows 1:
[13:08:28] <Velveeta> one of my coworkers just stumbled across this...... this is amazing.. https://github.com/jonathantneal/polyfill
[13:09:11] <duch_kazatel> woah
[13:09:31] <Velveeta> whoa indeed, and look at those transfer sizes! 338 *bytes* for chrome
[13:09:38] <Velveeta> 7.7k for IE6/7
[13:10:14] <BillCriswell> I'm sucha  dumbass.
[13:10:18] <duch_kazatel> that is baller.
[13:10:50] <Bentrand> Hi everyone! I would need a wiki system based on local storage in HTML5 and I want to actually connect that with jIO so that it syncs with a storage off the phone. Has anyone heard about anything like this or could give me tips for building it myself?
[13:10:52] <duch_kazatel> what's up capn' criswell?
[13:12:11] <BillCriswell> Could not figure out why the "sync" in Transmit wasn't lighting up. Googled for like 2 hours with no luck. I needed to have the local view displayed for it to be enabled.
[13:12:31] <duch_kazatel> those are the worst.
[13:12:47] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: This thing seems incredible.
[13:13:48] <naeluh_NSA> so then how can I get to be defined ?http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/5/
[13:14:03] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: I need the value outside of the callback
[13:15:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha I agree. I usually just drag from Finder to Remote.
[13:15:55] <BillCriswell> If this keeps in sync though I'll keep it open.
[13:16:08] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA i don't think you're understanding - it IS available outside of the callback.  it is scoped properly.
[13:16:28] <duch_kazatel> but not until after the event has returned
[13:17:56] <naeluh_NSA> ok so then my call to imgur in the outside $('#img2').text('<img src =' + imgur + '>'); will have a value and not be undefined ?
[13:18:22] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA as long as that call happens after the ajax has completed
[13:18:48] <Velveeta> bentrand: localforage uses websql and indexeddb where it's available, and falls back to localstorage, and works on phones also
[13:19:18] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: ok then I have to find a way to tell my outside version of the variable that ajax has completed is that correct?
[13:19:27] <Bentrand> velvetta: Awesome! Thank you, that might be what I am looking for to help implement.
[13:19:34] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA correct.  this is why you need to use the callbacks of ajax.
[13:19:51] <duch_kazatel> you should be writing functions that you can then call back to when ajax is done.
[13:20:31] <naeluh_NSA> ok
[13:22:59] <guideX> anyone know how to get the count of items in a jquery chosen multiselect list?
[13:23:58] <supsup> is there a way to bind a ready event to the creation of a selector in the dom?  not an event like click etc but it's creation (i've tried 'load')
[13:24:28] <duch_kazatel> supsup err, sort of, but that's ugly and painful.
[13:24:31] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do.
[13:24:49] <guideX> nevermind, figured it out
[13:24:53] <guideX> thanks though
[13:25:00] <guideX> $('#GaugeFilter1_lstGaugeName > option:selected').each(function() { .. etc
[13:25:10] <supsup> there is a video i have to play but it's loaded by ajax into a dialog box.  I want to attach some tracking code to it.
[13:25:19] <supsup> I can't change their ajax call...or i would just add it to the success
[13:25:41] <duch_kazatel> then detect ajax events at a page level.
[13:25:45] <Velveeta> supsup: you can try domcontentloaded, in the browsers that support it, otherwise you're gonna have to use dom polling
[13:26:07] <supsup> Velveeta ok i will google dom polling
[13:26:09] <Velveeta> er that event name was wrong
[13:27:09] <duch_kazatel> read this instead: http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[13:27:12] <duch_kazatel> do not poll the dom.
[13:27:55] <supsup> alright i'll try that first thanks ;-0
[13:33:31] <Bentrand> I think I will try a tiddlywiki on jIO or on localforage
[13:40:30] <LindsayMac> Hello.. I'm looking for a little help working with data.push and the select2 jQuery script. I have a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/TLXuD/
[13:41:05] <LindsayMac> if you start typing in the field you will see a list pop up which you can select from (an autocomplete basically)
[13:41:52] <LindsayMac> I have added the 'tag' option which allows you to save an query that wasn't found essentially adding a new record. All of that works (try typing a word that isn't in that list) and it saves to the field, but I can not figure out how to get that new item to push
[13:43:47] <LindsayMac> I am able to output the new values added in the field to the console, however
[13:43:53] <LindsayMac> so any help is greatly appreciated
[13:57:30] <LindsayMac> wow
[13:57:32] <LindsayMac> dead
[13:57:48] <duch_kazatel> what was the question?
[13:57:54] <duch_kazatel> i was late to the party.
[13:58:14] <LindsayMac> I'm working with data.push and the select2 jQuery script. I have a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/TLXuD/
[13:58:20] <LindsayMac> if you start typing in the field you will see a list pop up which you can select from (an autocomplete basically)
[13:58:29] <LindsayMac> I have added the 'tag' option which allows you to save an query that wasn't found essentially adding a new record. All of that works (try typing a word that isn't in that list) and it saves to the field, but I can not figure out how to get that new item to push
[13:58:52] <LindsayMac> I need the newly added items to end up in my data[]
[13:59:07] <duch_kazatel> oh, a big question.  i'm in a meeting, but I'll try to look when I get out.
[13:59:29] <duch_kazatel> i'd double check the docs, though.
[14:00:04] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i've double, triple, quadruple checked the docs.. that is why i'm here
[14:00:10] <LindsayMac> and yes, its a "big question" i suppose
[14:00:42] <zumba_addict> is ajax done also considered success?
[14:00:48] <zumba_addict> meaning no errors?
[14:00:49] <duch_kazatel> it's going to take somebody reading some documentation to figure out what's going on, which might be part of the problem.
[14:01:04] <zumba_addict> i want to make sure if i should use done or success
[14:01:49] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  what is part of the propblem?
[14:02:04] <LindsayMac> having a complex question in itself is a problem?? ha
[14:02:24] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict - https://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[14:02:33] <zumba_addict> thanks
[14:02:46] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac basically :p  folks will need to read docs and try to figure it out.
[14:03:36] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  Umm... 99% of the people in chatrooms like these have been people who have an inclination to want to debug and test and/or help.. I don't think the complexity of my question would be a problem for most people.
[14:03:38] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict actually, read this: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#callback-functions
[14:03:54] <zumba_addict> ok
[14:04:31] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac not saying it's a big problem, just that somebody will need to spin themselves up to help :)  that's all.
[14:04:34] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:04:53] <zumba_addict> I should use success then
[14:05:15] <zumba_addict> I only want to call it when it's really sure it's successful
[14:29:03] <greengriminal> I have the following gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8965825 and its just raw js and I was wondering if there is an elegent way of doing this using jquery?
[14:29:58] <LindsayMac> greengriminal:  how abotu you just say what it is you are trying to do instead of making people translate your code
[14:31:10] <greengriminal> LindsayMac: Well you can see that I build up a HTML element. Now i was wondering can you do this using jQuery.
[14:32:13] <greengriminal> My gist is fine it works. But i wondered if it is possible to build up a HTML element and get the same output as shown in my gist. That's all
[14:33:00] <NoiseEee> greengriminal: var someNewDiv = $('<div>',{data-something:'1b','class':'ng-scope',id:'someID'});
[14:33:18] <NoiseEee> greengriminal: someNewDiv.appendTo($('someElement'))
[14:33:31] <NoiseEee> greengriminal: but in general, should you be mixing jquery and angular?
[14:33:46] <NoiseEee> shouldn't those be angular template-ish things ?
[14:34:49] <greengriminal> NoiseEee: No but there is a specific reason why I need that output. And you are right about not mixing angular with jQuery. But angular does have jQlite if you've heard of it
[14:35:04] <NoiseEee_> greengriminal: so that's basically how to create an element ^^
[14:35:49] <greengriminal> NoiseEee_: I see
[14:36:48] <rainabba> When I target an element in chrome dev-tools, I can view bound "Event Listeners". When I use jQuery to bind with something like $(selector).click(), I can never tell which event listener is the result and how to inspect source as a result. Anyone know a way to do this? Assume I don't know where to find the JS source for a handler, but I KNOW one I see is mine.
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> the introduction of an SSD to my work laptop means that i can go from cold to fully working in around 3 and a half minutes.  that includes getting vagrant to start up a full centos server system.
[14:57:07] <duch_kazatel> so neat.
[14:59:53] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac looking at your question again, it looks like what you want is data to be var, not a property, yeah?
[15:00:45] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm, reading your code.
[15:00:48] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: well.. i really just want to update the value of the property as things change
[15:02:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/TLXuD/2/
[15:02:12] <duch_kazatel> something like this?
[15:02:39] <duch_kazatel> (that breaks things, but just poking around)
[15:03:42] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i dont see any change
[15:03:45] <LindsayMac> where did you add code?
[15:04:27] <duch_kazatel> I moved your data object up higher and referenced that var instaead of directly.
[15:04:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/TLXuD/2/
[15:05:33] <LindsayMac> I dont see how that changes anything
[15:05:35] <LindsayMac> to be honest.
[15:05:59] <duch_kazatel> the idea is you need to modify a var instead of trying to target the option.
[15:06:38] <LindsayMac> Look at   initSelection : ... that is the area in which it is all working to begin with
[15:06:53] <LindsayMac> Data IS being added to when you add stuff to the field
[15:07:00] <LindsayMac> or recorded
[15:07:35] <LindsayMac> I also would ask if you can comment the areas you tweaked so I can see them easier. Otherwise i'm comparing things side by side to see what you did d
[15:07:39] <LindsayMac> or having to ask
[15:08:07] <duch_kazatel> I reread your problem and I'm still missing something, then, because I can't figure out what you want.
[15:09:23] <duch_kazatel> as far as I can tell, you feed select2 a data object.  you want to add new info to that object.  it looks like this all ready happens as far as I can tell.
[15:09:27] <LindsayMac> Right now the script works FINE and saves the values for items that are added to the field that already exist.
[15:09:37] <LindsayMac> it is NOT saving the values for items that are newly created
[15:09:47] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[15:10:03] <LindsayMac> From what I can see, the reason is because the new data isn't being pushed OR maybe because it doesn't have an ID? not sure
[15:10:04] <duch_kazatel> so when you search for them again they aren't popping up in that box?
[15:10:46] <LindsayMac> No, they are not popping up in the box..
[15:11:01] <LindsayMac> this is also a similified version of what I actually have running that is attached to a DB
[15:11:26] <LindsayMac> the values that already existed are stored in the DB but the new ones are not because they aren't being passed the same as the others
[15:12:09] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18722148/select2-jquery-not-allow-to-add-new-tags does this help at all?
[15:12:20] <duch_kazatel> my guess is that the object isn't getting updated the way you need it to.
[15:15:07] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  not to sound like an ass, but I don't really need someon to google for me. I came here because I have exhausted that
[15:15:32] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac I'm bouncing around ideas because i don't really feel like dumping through all of select2's documentation for you :)
[15:16:27] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i am telling you that the documetation doesn't cover this and it's not really a select2 specific thing
[15:17:03] <LindsayMac> also if you look at my code, you can see I am using CreateSearchChoice to allow the additional of new tags
[15:17:23] <duch_kazatel> sorry for trying to work with you to get through the problem then!
[15:17:47] <duch_kazatel> i'll leave you alone :)
[15:18:07] <LindsayMac> well.. i'm just saying that its a waste of time to just google
[15:18:25] <duch_kazatel> I'm not "just googling".
[15:18:29] <duch_kazatel> I refuse to hand people code.
[15:18:32] <duch_kazatel> that's a personal thing.
[15:18:40] <LindsayMac> lol
[15:18:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm trying to ask questions that'll allow us to problem solve together :)
[15:18:46] <LindsayMac> i most definitely did not ask for that
[15:19:07] <LindsayMac> you posted a link to something that doesn't have anything to add to the problem
[15:19:22] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to add data to an array.
[15:19:44] <LindsayMac> and that link literally was asking "how do I make it not allow people to add new tags"
[15:19:56] <LindsayMac> nevermind
[15:20:02] <LindsayMac> you are wasting my time now
[15:20:15] <duch_kazatel> i literally said i'd stop bugging you.
[15:20:44] <jedimind> you ahve to say it figuratively too
[15:22:11] <duch_kazatel> i guess?
[15:27:13] <jbr> jqueryui slider: Can I call the initializer again to bulk-reset options?
[15:51:57] <motaka2> I want to add click event to some <li>s but whenever I click anywhere the event is triggred:  https://gist.github.com/gists
[15:52:35] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 try saving that first :)
[15:53:03] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8966985
[15:53:13] <motaka2> :)
[15:56:06] <motaka2> I want to add click event to some <li>s but whenever I click anywhere the event is triggred: https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8966985
[15:56:57] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 try to console.log($lis) and see waht that returns.
[15:57:04] <jbr> no thoughts on the slider() call?
[15:57:36] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: iT RETURNS NOTHING
[15:57:47] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 there's your problem :)
[15:58:20] <Lurzino> hello everyone :-) :-) :-) :-)
[15:58:21] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: why? when there is nothing the body will host the events ?
[15:58:30] <Lurzino> anyone could te
[15:58:41] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 dunno.  welcome to event delegation.  might be apart of the way .on() works.
[15:59:30] <Lurzino> could tell me if exists a way to simply play a mp3 file inside a web page while firing an event?
[15:59:52] <Lurzino> like a "bip"
[16:00:38] <duch_kazatel> !xy
[16:00:39] <jbr> Also curious to know how to handle non-200 responses to ajax calls, namely 403
[16:00:52] <duch_kazatel> jbr check out .error (i think it is)
[16:01:01] <duch_kazatel> and Lurzino mind clarifying your question?
[16:01:03] <jbr> ah. What's .fail for?
[16:01:25] <duch_kazatel> there's a .fail?
[16:01:32] <duch_kazatel> oh, those are promise callbacks
[16:01:48] <duch_kazatel> are you using promises, or just straight async?
[16:02:07] <jbr> $.getJSON() - the docs on that page say to stop using .error() as of 1.8
[16:02:42] <jbr> The last time I did heavy jQuery/ajax there were extra parameters to capture success, error, etc...
[16:02:46] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ - looking at this.
[16:02:49] <jbr> it seems like it's been revised a few times.. trying to keep up
[16:03:05] <duch_kazatel> specifically, this https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#callback-functions
[16:04:28] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I have no idea
[16:05:19] <jbr> duch_kazatel: so .error looks like it's still valid? Or should I transition to .complete() and handle both cases within that?
[16:05:38] <duch_kazatel> jbr dunno about $.getJSON(), only about $.ajax()
[16:05:54] <duch_kazatel> i'd say use .error() in there to handle error cases.
[16:05:58] <jbr> I think getJSON is an alias for the type option and some other stuff.
[16:06:04] <jbr> yeah migrate will tell me off if I'm doing it wrong
[16:06:10] <duch_kazatel> it is, but I'm not sure how it handles the extra ideas.
[16:06:16] <duch_kazatel> *extra options.
[16:06:19] <duch_kazatel> today has been long.
[16:06:26] <jbr> it's doing .done() well enough
[16:06:35] <jbr> I think it's even doing .fail, but not for .403
[16:06:53] <jbr> scratch that - I don't think I've confirmed a .fail
[16:07:04] <jbr> I like .always() though - will clean up some code.
[16:09:42] <Lurzino> duch_kazatel: practically i'd like to play a beep sound from a mp3 file without need of external player application but from inside website javascript/jquery code...is there a way to do it?
[16:11:21] <jbr> .error works thanks
[16:11:31] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: What about me ?
[16:12:40] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 hrm?  what else is there to say?
[16:13:11] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: may I have to stop propegation
[16:13:22] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't.  that's not the  issue.
[16:13:32] <duch_kazatel> the issue is you need to see if that element exists first.
[16:13:47] <duch_kazatel> then bind.
[16:13:55] <duch_kazatel> because you're using delegation wrong right now.
[16:14:27] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: but I am sure the element doesnt exist
[16:14:33] <motaka2> it will exist later
[16:14:40] <duch_kazatel> then don't bind a listener for it?
[16:14:47] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to use .on with a null value.
[16:17:48] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I solved it like this: https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8967288
[16:18:15] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[16:18:28] <duch_kazatel> that's a smarter way to handle that, though why are you turning the handler off?
[16:20:24] <pgnd> I've added Modernizr.js to my page; currently using the full/dev version.  After page load, I see the collection of Modernizr classes added to my <html> tag.  I want to redirect to a different URL if a particular feature is NOT supported.  E.g., if there's no "touch" support.
[16:20:28] <pgnd> On page-ready, I can either (1) check for the existence of the modernizr class already added to the tag: if ($("html.no-touch").length === 0){window.location.href = "http://other.domain.com";}, or (2) exec a specific check in js: Modernizr.load({ test: Modernizr.touch, yep : 'window.location.href = "http://other.domain.com";' });.
[16:20:35] <pgnd> Which is the less 'expensive' redirect?  I'm guessing (1), since the checks seem to have already been loaded and the class tags added ...
[16:21:19] <Lurzino> no possible answer to my question?
[16:21:41] <duch_kazatel> Lurzino i'd have to google it.
[16:21:58] <Lurzino> ah
[16:22:01] <duch_kazatel> [2014:02:12:16:20:24] <pgnd> I've added Modernizr.js to my page; currently using the
[16:22:07] <duch_kazatel> woops, bad copy/paste
[16:22:14] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/450033/playing-sound-notifications-using-javascript
[16:22:18] <duch_kazatel> that should answer your question.
[16:22:37] <pgnd> duch_kazatel: that for me?
[16:22:44] <duch_kazatel> no, meant that for Lurzino
[16:22:47] <pgnd> k
[16:25:05] <Lurzino> oh well then i'll google :-)
[16:25:37] <Lurzino> thanks anyway :-)
[16:42:03] <pom_life> Hey all!
[16:42:45] <motaka2> why in this piece of code return false doesnt stop the submission?   https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8967521
[16:43:59] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 do event.preventDefault() at the beginning there, instead.
[16:44:31] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: How are you doing today?
[16:45:35] <motaka2> thx it worked but why reurn false didnt work ?
[16:46:20] <duch_kazatel> pom_life I'm good.  a little tired.
[16:46:37] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 because return false; makes the function return false.  doesn't necessarily cancel the event.
[16:47:51] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I dont from where I remeber that return false will cancel the default action and propegation of event
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 okay.  use preventDefault() instead either way :)
[16:48:58] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I was just wondering, cause I see in stack peole are answering by return false;
[16:49:00] <Trisox> return false cancels all
[16:49:55] <duch_kazatel> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[16:51:27] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1357118/event-preventdefault-vs-return-false for some info.
[16:51:47] <naeluh_NSA> hi
[16:51:59] <pom_life> hello!
[16:53:39] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: check it out I think I have a callback function http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/PKSLj/
[16:53:49] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: In the professional world, do most big projects focus on being 100% OO from your experience?
[16:54:06] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: I can write pure OO code in JS, but I find global functions/variables to be useful sometimes
[17:00:03] <pom_life> naeluh_NSA: What does var varname; do?
[17:00:12] <pom_life> is it the same as var varname = null; ?
[17:01:31] <naeluh_NSA> in my code or your code? I dont think I have that
[17:01:40] <pom_life> in your code you have var imgur;
[17:01:46] <pom_life> is that the same as var imgur = null; ?
[17:01:57] <duch_kazatel> pom_life not at all.  here we have a mix of procedural, functional, and OO styles.  hell, our java backend is aspect oriented.
[17:01:58] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: $("body").off("submit", $forms).on("submit", $forms, function(event) {console.log(this)}  will say it is the body element while I want the form element  as this
[17:02:00] <motaka2> ?
[17:02:10] <duch_kazatel> pom_life it's the same as var imgur = undefined;
[17:02:18] <naeluh_NSA> pom_life: I think its undefined
[17:02:20] <pom_life> just a quicker way. gotcha.
[17:02:41] <naeluh_NSA> yeah what duch_kazatel said
[17:03:06] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 try doing just  $("body").on("submit", $forms, function(event), instead of chaining.
[17:03:09] <duch_kazatel> i'm interested.
[17:03:31] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: you mean to delete off ?
[17:03:46] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 do the off, then the on, without chaining.
[17:03:54] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA does that work?
[17:05:03] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: yes and no it does run and at least released the success function but I still cannot declare the var imgur outside of the success function
[17:05:51] <duch_kazatel> yes you can - you did right there.
[17:06:04] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8967796   still the same
[17:06:17] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 and what's in $forms?
[17:06:30] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: it is a form
[17:06:43] <duch_kazatel> is it a string?
[17:06:44] <duch_kazatel> or an object?
[17:06:57] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: $forms is not empty it really contains a form
[17:07:04] <duch_kazatel> that's wrong.
[17:07:12] <duch_kazatel> it needs to be a string.
[17:07:45] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: How can I select it by a string, I mean how to replace this var $forms = $(this.selector).parents("form");   with a string ?
[17:08:09] <shoky> motaka2: btw watch out..   .children("inputs[type:text]")     2 mistakes there
[17:08:27] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel: but if I call it outside of handleData() it still comes up undefined
[17:08:29] <pom_life> shoky: Hey shoky!
[17:08:39] <shoky> hiya pom_life
[17:08:55] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_NSA... all of your processing logic that requires that var must be called from that callback.
[17:08:57] <duch_kazatel> end of story.
[17:09:16] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 - you're convoluting event delegation.  the entire point it you can bind once and forget.  attach a class or something to the form, then do $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(){});
[17:09:18] <shoky> motaka2:  why not $forms.on("submit", ...
[17:09:31] <naeluh_NSA> all right then I will just reform my other code to get inside that call back thanks for your help much appreciated
[17:09:33] <duch_kazatel> or be more specific with that first selector.
[17:09:33] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: the new code is this:   https://gist.github.com/noondreams/8967829   that one was a previous verion
[17:09:39] <naeluh_NSA> duch_kazatel ^
[17:10:21] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you're turning on and off event handlers when you totally don't need ot.
[17:10:26] <motaka2> shoky: I want them to work correctely when the content is loading via ajax
[17:11:05] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: if I dont turn them off , two times of loading the js file cause double attaching events
[17:11:24] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 don't bind them within other event handlers.
[17:11:30] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 bind once and leave alone.
[17:12:18] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I dont understand you. Would you please give me an example
[17:12:20] <motaka2> ?
[17:12:23] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(){});
[17:12:39] <duch_kazatel> or give your form a class or an ID or something and target that instead.
[17:12:56] <duch_kazatel> but using event delegation and then removing the handlers points to a problem.
[17:14:11] <duch_kazatel> basically, bind to a parent element that exists on pageload and never goes away and have your child selector do the work.
[17:14:12] <duch_kazatel> done.
[17:14:14] <duch_kazatel> ~next
[17:17:57] <duch_kazatel> pom_life did I answer your question earlier?
[17:19:08] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Yeah man.
[17:20:19] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: This is confusing me a tad, though: http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/97D2y/
[17:20:31] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: I'm getting some wird jQuery error in console I haven't seen before.
[17:21:27] <duch_kazatel> pom_life $this.parent probably isn't set right.
[17:21:51] <pom_life> Oh, forgot the param parentheses
[17:21:53] <pom_life> Good catch
[17:22:18] <pom_life> Hey, in CSS when discussing the width and length of a div
[17:22:23] <pom_life> is it width/length? or length/width?
[17:22:30] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?
[17:22:35] <pom_life> like would a 400 x 200 be tall or wide?
[17:22:44] <duch_kazatel> wide imo.
[17:22:46] <duch_kazatel> x and y
[17:23:12] <pom_life> so when writing the css, it's probably good practice to do width: 5, length: 10?
[17:23:14] <pom_life> rather than reverse
[17:23:20] <pom_life> width/height *
[17:23:24] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't think about it nearly that much.
[17:24:22] <duch_kazatel> and when writing css, it's height and width
[17:25:20] <pom_life> all right
[17:29:27] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Is JS like C# where everything is an object of some sort technically?
[17:29:41] <duch_kazatel> yep.  almost everything.
[17:30:21] <duch_kazatel> arrays are objects, too.
[17:36:47] <pom_life> Do you ever use XMLHTTPRequest?
[17:36:55] <duch_kazatel> sure, when doing ajax
[17:37:01] <duch_kazatel> comes with the territory
[17:37:36] <pom_life> I think that's my next step
[17:37:57] <duch_kazatel> that'll also get you to learn a little about CORS.
[17:38:23] <pom_life> CORS?
[17:38:31] <duch_kazatel> cross origin resource sharing.
[17:38:46] <duch_kazatel> it's apart of browser security.
[17:55:27] <lyrae> Is it possible to assign jquery the dom to parse?
[17:55:57] <lyrae> right now when we do $('table'), it parses the current DOM. but i want it to use another dom instead, stored in a string
[17:56:32] <BillCriswell> lyrae: $('<table/>')
[17:56:52] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Evening Bill!
[17:56:56] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Howdy!
[17:57:05] <pom_life> BillCriswell: How was your day?
[17:57:29] <BillCriswell> It was good. Not looking forward to all the snow.
[17:57:45] <pom_life> What's snow? hahaha
[17:57:54] <lyrae> BillCriswell: that was an exable
[17:58:12] <lyrae> by your answer, id have to do $(document.body)
[17:58:28] <lyrae> so then i would have to use .find() from here on to find anything
[17:58:38] <BillCriswell> lyrae: No. That would select the <body> tag.
[17:58:55] <BillCriswell> How was yours pom_life?
[17:59:16] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Well, I just found out my grandfather sold his '55 chevy for 18k a few minutes ago
[17:59:21] <pom_life> BillCriswell: That's quite the relief
[18:00:09] <BillCriswell> lyrae: Are you trying to do like var $someHTML = $('<div><span class="test">I am test</span></div>'); then do $someHTML.find('.test').text('New Text'); $('body').append($someHTML); ?
[18:00:59] <BillCriswell> pom_life: That sounds good.
[18:01:39] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Yeah. They needed some money for some home repairs, and I found a guy willing to buy the car. This'll do them a world of good. As far as me, I'm working on (yet another) little mini game to acquire some new skills!
[18:01:59] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Sounds like a good approach!
[18:02:04] <lyrae> BillCriswell: not sure.  But i think so. (I am making an exntension for Chrome, so it's confuising. It's giving my extension's HTML as a callback in a function.)
[18:02:21] <sx_> Hi,guys, what does $("dt+dd a") means..i d't understand the + operator
[18:02:34] <lyrae> so in the js file, i cant simply $('foo'), becuase the dom isn there. I need to assign jquery to that dom
[18:03:11] <lyrae> right now im doing  `dom = panelWindow.document.body`    and then $(dom).find('foo')
[18:03:34] <lyrae> panelWindow is what the callback fn gives
[18:03:41] <BillCriswell> sx_: It selects ever a inside a dd that's preceded by a dt.
[18:03:53] <BillCriswell> s/ever/every
[18:04:39] <BillCriswell> lyrae: What do you get if you console.log( panelWindow ) ?
[18:05:38] <sx_> @BillCriswell,get it , thanks
[18:06:02] <lyrae> BillCriswell: its an object. I cant output to console because chrome devtools doesnt have a devtools itself
[18:06:21] <lyrae> (its an extension for devtools). I can alert it though, and its an object. i can stringify it to see
[18:07:32] <bleathem> I use $.browser to check if the browser is internet explorer and listen for keydown (to respond to arrow keys)
[18:07:44] <bleathem> How can I adapt this code to work without using $.browser?
[18:08:13] <bleathem> kborchers: are you around?
[18:10:25] <BillCriswell> bleathem: You can test navigator.userAgent
[18:10:53] <bleathem> thanks BillCriswell, but I thought the canonical answer was to use "feature detection"
[18:11:11] <bleathem> I'm having a tough time wrapping my head around that
[18:11:12] <BillCriswell> bleathem: Absolutely, but you're looking for IE.
[18:11:31] <BillCriswell> Why are you targeting just IE to begin with?
[18:12:22] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Check out the bottom function in this code, updateGame. What's wrong with the .element.append I have? >http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/JsTpw/
[18:18:08] <BillCriswell_> Er.
[18:18:24] <BillCriswell> bleathem: Did you say anything?
[18:19:58] <pom_life> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/JsTpw/ ---> The bottom function, updateGame(), has a problem with the .element.append. Think you could take a look?
[18:24:49] <pom_life> Nevermind ^^
[18:27:46] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Ok cool!
[18:27:55] <pom_life> Sometimes answers are so dumb.
[18:27:57] <pom_life> lol~
[18:31:40] <pom_life> BillCriswell: What's the opposite of .append?
[18:31:43] <pom_life> .remove?
[18:32:14] <BillCriswell> pom_life: prepend
[18:32:32] <BillCriswell> .append adds to the end, .prepend adds to the beginning.
[18:33:24] <pom_life> In my code, I append("<div id='Player'></div>") in one section. I need another section to take that away. Would it be remove("<div id='Player'></div>"); ?
[18:34:07] <BillCriswell> pom_life: You would need to do like element.find('#Player').remove()
[18:34:28] <BillCriswell> If there's ever more than one #Player you probably want to use a class.
[18:35:21] <pom_life> BillCriswell: There wouldn't be. Here, take a look at my code. http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/JsTpw/1/
[18:35:57] <pom_life> Update game initially puts the plyaer token at the first open spot. Hovering over another space down there SHOULD remove the old token first, then place a new one where you hovered
[18:39:05] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Do you mean o be recrating the player element all the time?
[18:39:42] <pom_life> Your .element.find('#Player').remove() worked.
[18:41:05] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Ok cool.
[18:42:25] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Simple way to check if a div of a certain ID is in an element?
[18:42:51] <BillCriswell> element.find('#id').length
[18:42:59] <BillCriswell> element.has('#id') should also work.
[18:47:34] <BillCriswell> pom_life: If you're moving around #player a lot you can try this approach. Might be a little easier than creating and removing over and over again: http://jsbin.com/falup/1/edit?js,output
[18:53:28] <pom_life> BillCriswell: I like that, looks more streamlined. You know anything about making the pointer disappear when hovering over certain elements?
[18:54:48] <BillCriswell> That would just be the css cursor propert I Think.
[18:55:11] <BillCriswell> td:hover { cursor: none; } apparently.

[18:57:37] <mfoxdogg|work> hi all i need some help with dates, i have an array of values which are the comonents of a date(["2013", "12", "9", "9", "5", "22", "867"]), but im getting Date {Thu Jan 09 2014 13:54:47 GMT+1100 (AUS Eastern Standard Time)}
[18:58:04] <pom_life> yep. Wow, it's actually possible to create some pretty neat little games with just jQuery/javascript and HTML/CSS. Add in a little AJAX for sound effects, and you've got something
[18:58:42] <doug65536> mfoxdogg|work: months start at 0
[18:58:55] <mfoxdogg|work> oh
[18:59:05] <doug65536> stupid but true
[18:59:22] <mfoxdogg|work> there we go!!!
[18:59:54] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Don't really need ajax for that
[18:59:56] <mfoxdogg|work> thanks doug65536
[19:00:11] <doug65536> mfoxdogg|work: np
[19:00:22] <hd1> http://news.d8u.us/jqueryTest.html why is this not working?

[19:08:40] <hd1> mythril: ok
[19:08:43] <hd1> thank you
[19:28:36] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Any tips on staying focused on a single project? I find myself hopping from project to project a LOT. Or is that normal?
[19:28:36] <therealklanni> Valesk: is load not working for you?
[19:28:57] <Valesk> I may be selecting elements in the DOM incorrectly.
[19:29:00] <Valesk> I'll link you, one sec.
[19:29:03] <therealklanni> k
[19:29:04] <BillCriswell> pom_life: I am definitely the wrong person to ask about that. If it's not a work project I don't finish it. It kind of sucks.
[19:29:38] <therealklanni> pom_life: normal for me :p
[19:30:12] <Valesk> therealklanni here's the page: http://54.84.32.87/ingredients click on the slider select an ingredient and it will reload the page but the post will show up correctly.
[19:30:48] <therealklanni> pom_life: I find I am more motivated to focus on a project when I either have other devs working with me, or end users that are already interested in using whatever it is (or both)
[19:31:56] <Valesk> https://gist.github.com/taylorqj/2bc425351ef436b828ab
[19:32:07] <pom_life> therealklanni: Yeah, I would imagine that would initiate a feedback loop, where you can constantly get feedback on improvements and thus strive to do better
[19:32:19] <therealklanni> Valesk: am I getting a cut of your commission for this? ;p
[19:32:19] <therealklanni> jk
[19:32:20] <Valesk> I'm probably way off but that was my general 'idea' of how it should work.. no?
[19:32:25] <Valesk> Of course you are!
[19:32:27] <Valesk> <3
[19:32:50] <therealklanni> my fee is 1Â¢/hr
[19:32:59] <Valesk> Done.
[19:33:03] <therealklanni> lol
[19:33:05] <Valesk> Paypal.
[19:33:06] <pom_life> he meant 1 martian cent
[19:33:10] <Valesk> Oh no.
[19:33:12] <pom_life> the same as 300 earth usd
[19:33:12] <Valesk> Is that like bitcoin?
[19:33:19] <therealklanni> yep
[19:33:23] <therealklanni> 1 bitcoin
[19:33:24] <Valesk> shieeet.
[19:33:29] <therealklanni> ;p
[19:33:30] <pom_life> Speaking of, I invested $500 in Dogecoin today.
[19:33:34] <therealklanni> nice
[19:33:37] <Valesk> Hey, I'll contribute some cash if you help me understand it better. :D
[19:34:41] <therealklanni> Valesk: ok, so help me understand this.. when you click an ingredient, it goes to a new route server-side... e.g. /ingredients/spinach/
[19:34:50] <Valesk> Correct, this is a wordpress backend.
[19:34:54] <Valesk> So it's loading another post.
[19:34:55] <therealklanni> What is not working about that?
[19:35:16] <Valesk> I'd like to load the content of that particular post in that #real-ingredients container.
[19:35:24] <Valesk> Whenever an ingredient is clicked.
[19:35:41] <therealklanni> You don't want to it go to /ingredients/spinach/ ?
[19:35:51] <therealklanni> Just stay at /ingredients/ ?
[19:36:14] <Valesk> I'd like to grab the #real-ingredients container from whatever post is clicked.
[19:36:20] <Valesk> It can stay at incredients/
[19:36:23] <therealklanni> Also, any way you can push a build with minification off? :P
[19:36:27] <Valesk> but ingredients/#whatever
[19:36:50] <Valesk> eeeeff.. probably not. What do you need to see?
[19:36:56] <therealklanni> Oh, so you want it to be a single page app, with hash routing
[19:37:01] <Valesk> Basically.
[19:37:24] <therealklanni> Just need to see whatever code you're working with so far.. the part that you're trying to use load
[19:37:52] <Valesk> I've basically just started but I can't figure out if I need to go with ajax or just a .load()
[19:37:58] <Valesk> The gist is what I've started.
[19:38:04] <Valesk> To see if I can grab something.
[19:38:20] <therealklanni> Oh I didn't see the gist link, lemme look
[19:38:31] <Valesk> 3 lines :P
[19:39:01] <invinceable> i'm using an ajax post request to register the user, upon successful registration i'm firing a function with the success callback. is it proper practice to then initiate another (GET this time) ajax request to another part of the server?
[19:39:34] <therealklanni> OK, for starters, you want to lose the #real-ingredients part inside the load() call
[19:40:05] <Valesk> I don't want to target that area inside the ingredients/whatever page?
[19:40:05] <invinceable> my contention is that if on the backend after successfully validating/registering the user and i then have a CURL request to hit another endpoint on another server that will ultimately slow down the registration process versus if it just has one call to make on the backend
[19:40:08] <therealklanni> Also, you probably should add `event` parameter to the function, then inside the function do `event.preventDefault()`
[19:40:34] <therealklanni> Valesk: the part before the load() call is the target.. `$('#real-ingredients')`
[19:41:45] <invinceable> then it makes the GET request upon sucessful registration on the front side before redirecting the user (ala not having to wait for the server side code on the second parameter to complete as well the user will just be redirected)
[19:41:48] <Valesk> Right, the target to load the contents inside of.
[19:41:53] <therealklanni> Uhm, but that may pose a problem, because based on what I'm seeing, the path /ingredients/sesame-seeds/ loads the entire site, not just a snippet, so you're going to end up with the site embedded inside itself
[19:42:05] <Valesk> Right.
[19:42:11] <Valesk> So I had to target #real-ingredients of that page.
[19:42:45] <Valesk> $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" );
[19:42:51] <Valesk> is in the load documentation
[19:43:05] <Valesk> loads the #container element of ajax/text.html into #result
[19:43:14] <therealklanni> Oh sorry, when you said target, I thought you were referring to the target where it loads to
[19:43:15] <Valesk> Or it says it does!
[19:43:20] <Valesk> no prob :D
[19:43:27] <therealklanni> So yeah, leave that bit in
[19:43:35] <therealklanni> But do the preventDefault()
[19:43:45] <Valesk> and hypothetically that should do it?
[19:43:57] <Valesk> which makes the default link unclickable and triggers the function?
[19:44:12] <therealklanni> Well, that will prevent the page from nagivating to the href of that anchor
[19:44:29] <therealklanni> So yeah, hypothetically that should do it
[19:45:11] <Valesk> Hmmm! okay.. give me a min
[19:45:34] <therealklanni> nagivating?
[19:45:40] <therealklanni> lol
[19:45:51] <therealklanni> navigating*
[19:46:04] <GoSox> does .serialize( ) not include form elements that are disabled/
[19:46:45] <Valesk> therealklanni you're my man
[19:46:53] <Valesk> therealklanni what's your paypal bro!
[19:47:13] <therealklanni> lol that's not necessary :)
[19:47:30] <therealklanni> My reward is your gratitude :P
[19:47:51] <Valesk> ^_^ thanks again
[19:47:53] <therealklanni> GoSox: does the element have the name attribute?
[19:47:58] <GoSox> yes
[19:48:00] <therealklanni> Valesk: np :)
[19:48:23] <GoSox> but it seems to not be included in the .serialize()'d string, when that element is disabled via .prop()
[19:48:50] <therealklanni> GoSox: sounds like you have your answer, then
[19:49:08] <GoSox> i guess
[19:49:12] <GoSox> yay assumptions
[19:49:42] <therealklanni> Seems counter-intuitive, though
[19:50:03] <GoSox> there is some logic to it but, not a lot
[19:58:32] <pom_life> ahaaaaaaaa
[19:58:35] <pom_life> I have a good idea!
[19:59:07] <AliasThing> Anyone know the node.js irc?
[19:59:40] <pom_life> #node.js
[19:59:41] <pom_life> lol
[20:00:22] <AliasThing> Thanks
[20:00:54] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Still here?
[20:10:07] <BillCriswell> I'm back now.
[20:17:48] <therealklanni> pom_life: idea?
[20:24:40] <pom_life> therealklanni: You ever seen the cube movie series?
[20:24:56] <pom_life> BillCriswell: wb!
[20:29:18] <BillCriswell> Awwww
[20:29:21] <BillCriswell> Ayyy*
[20:29:42] <pom_life> I think I've got a project in mind I'm going to stick with (hopefully).
[20:29:57] <pom_life> Have you ever seen Cube / Cube zero / Hypercube?
[20:32:38] <BillCriswell> I have not.
[20:34:32] <pom_life> I recommend them. They're budget films from canada, but you can hardly tell. Anyway, the premise is that a group of people wake up in a strange cube-like room. There are six exits to the room: above, below, and each wall. Each room looks exactly the same as the one before it, with a different color. Some rooms are trapped, though, and the traps var
[20:34:32] <pom_life> y widely. One trap is a folding-board made of metal that swings down, and rapidly moves from one side of the room to the other, slicing anyone in the room in half.
[20:34:57] <pom_life> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBMnCMtbRkQ
[20:35:14] <pom_life> I'd like to make a game knockoff of cube with some homemade elements thrown in
[20:39:30] <BillCriswell> s
[20:39:34] <BillCriswell> Sounds pretty bad ass.
[20:39:55] <pom_life> Yeah. The traps would be triggered by certain tiles, and all of them would be avoidable. Some more so than others.
[20:48:23] <BillCriswell> Seems like it could be fun.
[20:49:50] <pom_life> I just want something I'll stick with. I do art and I play guitar, and I was wanting to do art and music for a project. I need to maintain that level of interest, though.
[20:50:47] <BillCriswell> Good way to combine them all together.
[20:52:00] <therealklanni> pom_life: cube?
[20:52:08] <therealklanni> pom_life: this the horror one?
[20:52:10] <pom_life> yeah
[20:52:12] <pom_life> you saw it?
[20:52:19] <Andy_G3> hey guys, i've got a hidden div, and with jquery I want it to open slowly once the page loads, but it isnt working, just stays hidden.. heres my code http://pastebin.com/A3j8AWnR
[20:52:31] <therealklanni> I think I've seen one, but it must have been a while ago
[20:52:41] <therealklanni> I'm not even sure I was aware it was a series
[20:53:00] <therealklanni> (reading backlog)
[20:53:06] <pom_life> yeah. it has the main movie, a prequel, and a sequel.
[20:53:25] <therealklanni> Hypercube might be the one I saw
[20:53:34] <pom_life> imo, it wasn't as good
[20:53:43] <pom_life> the traps in cube 1 were brutal
[20:53:47] <therealklanni> Sounds like a fun project
[20:54:13] <pom_life> the thing that's confusing to me is...
[20:54:29] <pom_life> let's say halfway through the project I come up with an idea to streamline the data structures
[20:54:39] <pom_life> by putting some random globals into an object
[20:54:45] <pom_life> isn't that like, mega difficult
[20:55:28] <therealklanni> "random globals into an object"?
[20:55:39] <Andy_G3> anyone know the answer to my problem?
[20:55:53] <pom_life> let's just say I come up with something that needs to be done. so i hack it together. later on, i want to reorganize.
[20:56:10] <pom_life> i get discouraged when that happens, as it requires a lot of tweaking... but i dont want to meticulously plan out every detail ahead of time
[20:56:16] <pom_life> whats a good way to strike a balance?
[20:56:27] <therealklanni> Modules
[20:56:54] <Uhkis> Andy_G3: replace "visibility hidden" with display: none;
[20:57:47] <Andy_G3> Oh perfect" Thankyou so much uhkis!! :D
[20:58:14] <Andy_G3> this was doing my head in for like an hour ^^
[20:58:39] <pom_life> Andy_G#: FWIW, I think all similar functions in jQuery rely on display: none;
[20:58:42] <pom_life> I know fadein/out do
[20:59:04] <Andy_G3> I see, thankyou.  Im new to jquery. still gotta learn the ins and outs
[20:59:13] <pom_life> Did you already do the codecademy course?
[20:59:25] <Andy_G3> nope
[20:59:33] <pom_life> I can't recommend it higher.
[20:59:47] <pom_life> All codecademy courses are great, and the jquery had me making games after only a couple of days.
[20:59:59] <Andy_G3> I code in other languages.. so picking up a new one is pretty do-able. I only started learning jqueryt today
[21:00:15] <pom_life> Yeah, I moved from python to js
[21:00:25] <Andy_G3> hmm, sounds good, i'll take a look, thanks pom
[21:02:17] <Andy_G3> not surprised.. jquery makes thinks a heck of alot easier than straight javascript
[21:02:22] <Andy_G3> *things
[21:02:30] <Andy_G3> never did learn python
[21:02:50] <pom_life> you could have it down in 2 hours
[21:02:50] <pom_life> lol
[21:03:04] <pom_life> im pretty sure it's the easiest language there is
[21:03:46] <pom_life> here's iterating over a 2d array:
[21:03:50] <Andy_G3> lol. It's a pretty old language, my they didnt even talk about it in my CS course
[21:03:55] <pom_life> for row in array:
[21:03:58] <pom_life> for space in row:
[21:04:01] <pom_life> <do this>
[21:04:34] <pom_life> instead of (var i = 0,i < array.length, i++);
[21:04:42] <lemony> ^ Most inefficient way to iterate over a 2d list
[21:04:44] <lemony> just saying
[21:04:57] <pom_life> how is it the most inefficient in python
[21:05:04] <lemony> list comprehension is faster
[21:05:12] <lemony> but then depends on the out put really
[21:05:24] <pom_life> Let's say I have a 10 x 10 table
[21:05:32] <pom_life> and I want to iterate over it and make each space a new object
[21:05:33] <Andy_G3> those types of languages confuse the heck out of me.. I try to stay away from languages that aren't very conventional
[21:05:46] <lemony> [it for row in array for it in row]
[21:05:51] <lemony> ^ that  is the power of python
[21:05:53] <lemony> :P
[21:06:04] <pom_life> OH. That's what you mean by list comprehension.
[21:06:07] <lemony> yep
[21:06:17] <pom_life> Yeah, I knew about that haha. Forgot the name, though.
[21:06:25] <pom_life> also, lambdas
[21:06:28] <lemony> yeah I always though the nested for was good enough
[21:06:28] <pom_life> I like those too
[21:06:37] <lemony> mmm I need to use lambdas properly
[21:06:39] <lemony> and generators
[21:06:48] <obert> ot!
[21:07:12] <pom_life> lemony: You super familiar with canvas?
[21:07:31] <lemony> pom_life: no unfortunately
[21:07:36] <pom_life> :(
[21:07:46] <pom_life> I want to learn, it just seems so... daunting. lol
[21:07:51] <lemony> what is it? html canvas tag?
[21:08:02] <lemony> or some framework
[21:08:21] <pom_life> canvas is just a tag that represents a "screen" that can be drawn onto with vanilla js
[21:08:28] <lemony> ah right
[21:08:31] <lemony> no never used it
[21:08:47] <pom_life> it's super useful for animations and games, but learning how to draw shapes seems ridiculous just looking at it
[21:11:22] <therealklanni> Speaking of canvas...
[21:11:50] <therealklanni> Some app I'm working on, I just noticed a bug with my canvas :(
[21:12:06] <therealklanni> Super strange, since that code hasn't been touched at all
[21:12:08] <obert> therealklanni: just one? lucky u
[21:12:30] <therealklanni> It's not doing anything overtly complicated, but yeah
[21:12:40] <therealklanni> overly*
[21:12:50] <obert> i find thousands of bugs in my code:p
[21:13:10] <therealklanni> heh
[21:13:33] <pom_life> wouldn't overtly be correct there too?
[21:13:58] <pom_life> I think it would :]
[21:14:26] <therealklanni> Hmmm. Seems to be a problem with the library.. or how I'm using it
[21:14:34] <therealklanni> pom_life: I suppose it would
[21:14:46] <therealklanni> pom_life: I'm tired ;P
[21:16:20] <pom_life> What neck of the woods do you live in?
[21:16:39] <therealklanni> Arizona
[21:16:58] <pom_life> Texas here.
[21:17:09] <pom_life> be right back, I've got a bowl of some good with my name on it.
[21:17:49] <tw2113> frosted flakes??
[21:18:17] <pom_life> sure. frosted flakes. from California.
[21:18:49] <lemony> ^ forsties?
[21:18:55] <lemony> frosties*
[21:19:36] <therealklanni> aha, no issues in production, must be the latest version of paper.js
[21:23:48] <therealklanni> yep, just rolled back the version and it's fine now... ugh that's going to be fun later
[21:27:14] <shoky> hmm frosties
[21:40:08] <pom_life> shoky: you on?
[21:43:24] <shoky> pom_life: kinda
[21:52:33] <pom_life> Can javascript do jagged tables?
[21:52:51] <pom_life> arrays*(
[21:55:45] <shoky> what's that?
[21:56:28] <shoky> array of arrays? sure
[21:56:51] <shoky> you can put any javascript value in an array
[21:57:35] <sammych> hay all
[21:57:45] <sammych> easy one for you lot
[21:58:02] <sammych> is it necessary to use !! in an if-statement?
[21:58:12] <shoky> wat
[21:58:21] <shoky> in any if-statement?
[21:58:37] <sammych> not where a === is concerned
[21:59:00] <sammych> some devs here are doing if (!!possibleNullVar) { ... }
[21:59:01] <shoky> no, it's not necessary, in fact you usually don't use it
[21:59:23] <shoky> !! turns something into a boolean value
[21:59:25] <sammych> so before I go off an tell them flatly it's totally redundant
[21:59:35] <sammych> I just want to make sure because I know that's what it does
[21:59:44] <shoky> if you have a special need for a boolean value then you can use it, sure
[21:59:50] <sammych> an if statement evals to a truthy statement
[22:00:05] <sammych> well, probably worded better than that
[22:00:08] <iredmedia> !! === good
[22:00:26] <sammych> !!nullVar == bool
[22:00:30] <sammych> sorry
[22:00:36] <sammych> !!nullVar === bool
[22:00:39] <shoky> !!anything === bool
[22:00:42] <iredmedia> ~~true :O
[22:00:56] <sammych> I mean, where bool is true or false
[22:00:57] <iredmedia> lol
[22:01:01] <sammych> not the type
[22:01:16] <shoky> it's not specific to null
[22:01:26] <sammych> it's an example
[22:01:39] <shoky> !!nullVar === false
[22:01:41] <iredmedia> @shoky what you mean?
[22:01:42] <iredmedia> !!null === false?
[22:01:57] <shoky> what do i mean by what?
[22:02:00] <sammych> nullVar = possible nullVar
[22:02:21] <sammych> I got my answer anyway :) thanks for the validation
[22:02:24] <shoky> !!possibleNullVar === bool   yes
[22:02:27] <iredmedia> :) no worries
[22:02:56] <iredmedia> Yeah  !! is powerful. :) ~~ is too
[22:03:01] <iredmedia> different outcome , different use cases
[22:03:28] <shoky> ~~ is the one that's good for stuff that is -1 or not, right
[22:03:31] <shoky> like indexOf ?
[22:04:11] <sammych> just about to do some reading on the tilde operator
[22:04:16] <shoky> let's see
[22:04:21] <shoky> oh no bot.
[22:04:56] <shoky> ah i'm wrong anyway
[22:05:04] <iredmedia> It returns integers, yes, but ~~-1 === -1
[22:05:06] <shoky> confusing with another trick
[22:05:57] <iredmedia> yeah theres a few bitwise operators. kinda confusing, not readable, but... opinions are opinions, and readability is sujective
[22:06:37] <sammych> some here are definitely advocates of readability
[22:06:47] <sammych> I see this fairly often, and it hurts my brain
[22:06:56] <shoky> ah it's just one ~
[22:07:03] <sammych> if (isBooleanVar == true) { ... }
[22:07:09] <iredmedia> They can like the idea all they want. They can never quantify it
[22:07:14] <shoky> ~(-1) is falsy,  ~(anytinhg else)  is truthy
[22:07:46] <shoky> so you can do  if (~a.indexOf(b)) { ... }
[22:07:58] <iredmedia> Not true, ~(1) === -2?
[22:08:07] <shoky> right, that's truthy
[22:08:49] <iredmedia> i mean, indexOf?
[22:08:51] <iredmedia> is that right?
[22:08:58] <shoky> hm?
[22:09:20] <iredmedia> oh i c
[22:09:37] <sammych> ah, that's sneaky
[22:09:38] <iredmedia> Yes, good usecase.
[22:09:47] <iredmedia> but ~()
[22:10:01] <sammych> I don't know if my fellow coders will like it
[22:10:05] <shoky> not like  !== -1  is more readable :p
[22:10:11] <sammych> i just got them used to the idea of tenery ops
[22:10:12] <iredmedia> wait
[22:10:33] <iredmedia> Lol yeah, its extra code, vs someone knowing a concept.
[22:11:00] <iredmedia> We dont write code saying "Dont understand basic math, and any language specific syntax!"
[22:11:17] <iredmedia> Thats my argument. Lol. As my good friend nick always said "Thats an HR problem" ;) lol
[22:11:18] <sammych> I had to stop with my crusade for code minimalisation
[22:11:57] <iredmedia> Meh, I'm not into minimalisation. Just reasoning. If someone can't open a console and learn a new concept, i dont want them on my team.
[22:13:21] <iredmedia> Anyways i'm out! Till tm!
[22:15:34] <Eddie_> gates
[22:15:49] <shoky> sammych that  if (isBooleanVar == true)  { .. }  reminds me of something horrible i ran into last week
[22:15:57] <shoky> namely:   if ((bPlaylistConverted ? 1:0) + (bLayoutConverted?1:0) + (bScheduleConverted? 1:0) > 1)    paramName = "PlLaConverted";
[22:20:08] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[22:20:25] <Starcraftmazter> proper way to hook onto a select field change event?
[22:29:14] <_pingu> search for a plugin to make a fixed footer bar. it should hold informations about the things the user had last done. for instance: saved object x, deleted object y... . some of the informations should appear at mouseover ... . . can somebody recommend something?
[22:37:39] <mrigali> http://sciactive.com/pnotify/#demos-advanced
[22:38:09] <Tomashe> is there such a thing .naturalHeight() ?
[22:42:37] <_pingu> mrigali: something more like a fix statusbar at the bottom of a page would be nice
[22:53:51] <macma> hi
[23:01:08] <macma> hsa quit
[23:01:14] <macma> has quit
[23:01:19] <macma> quit
[23:01:21] <Tomashe> Guys, there is a way to use the Natuarl device style buttons?
[23:01:22] <macma> exit
[23:01:24] <Tomashe> heheh
[23:14:15] <BrazenBraden> morning all.
[23:14:23] <duch_kazatel> good evening
[23:14:48] <BrazenBraden> i have read that the 'click' event is not valid for select elements.. is there some event that is triggered on click of a select box?
[23:14:56] <BrazenBraden> http://jsfiddle.net/LDdfn/
[23:15:34] <duch_kazatel> change
[23:15:41] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want
[23:15:56] <BrazenBraden> change only gets called after clicking the select and having it drop down... im trying to catch it before it drops down the options
[23:16:14] <duch_kazatel> then click is valid.
[23:16:22] <duch_kazatel> why wouldn't it be?
[23:16:23] <BrazenBraden> in essence, i want to disable="disable" the select without actually disabling it
[23:17:21] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to disable them, then.  i don't know that you can do this any other way.
[23:17:25] <BrazenBraden> on change only fires when you click the select and then choose a different option
[23:17:34] <duch_kazatel> I'm aware of when change fires.
[23:17:42] <duch_kazatel> what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[23:17:53] <BrazenBraden> problem with disabling it is that my form validation no longer considers it an element worth validating
[23:18:16] <duch_kazatel> then reenable it before you run your validation?
[23:18:36] <BrazenBraden> easier said than done
[23:19:04] <duch_kazatel> i'd create a function that calls the re-enabling and validator for you.
[23:19:05] <BrazenBraden> is there a on focus?
[23:19:07] <duch_kazatel> but that's me.
[23:19:21] <BrazenBraden> maybe on hover?
[23:19:34] <duch_kazatel> you can use any event in place of "click"
[23:19:47] <BrazenBraden> but not all events are valid
[23:20:11] <duch_kazatel> there are a specific subset you can use, but your requirements aren't going to work
[23:20:22] <duch_kazatel> you cannot disable the form field without setting it to disabled.
[23:21:07] <BrazenBraden> i might be able to do it with focus... one sec while i puzzle it out (will jsfiddle the solution just now if it works)
[23:22:05] <duch_kazatel> that's terrible.
[23:22:06] <duch_kazatel> it works.
[23:22:26] <duch_kazatel> why would you have an input available to the end user if you don't want them to interact with it?
[23:23:55] <BrazenBraden> the one select box is essentially linked to another one.. you can only change select 2's value AFTER changing select 1
[23:24:32] <duch_kazatel> I personally would've disabled it and then enabled it when it was kosher.
[23:25:36] <BrazenBraden> that is what i had before.. but alas, validation issue.. i know this is hacky.. but lets see
[23:26:00] <duch_kazatel> how were you changing disabled?  .attr('disabled', false)?
[23:27:33] <BrazenBraden> bascially
[23:27:37] <BrazenBraden> (used .prop)
[23:27:52] <duch_kazatel> aaaah, that might have been the isue.
[23:27:56] <duch_kazatel> *issue
[23:28:33] <BrazenBraden> how so? arent they the same thing?
[23:30:02] <duch_kazatel> one gets the attribute value, the other a property value.
[23:30:40] <BrazenBraden> will try with attr and see if that makes any difference
[23:30:44] <duch_kazatel> iirc, changing the attribute value changes the rendered markup, which the validator code may have been looking at instead of the prop.
[23:31:42] <BrazenBraden> nah. same problem with validation
[23:32:22] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/prop/ - I'd read this either way, because there is a distincton between the two.
[23:32:28] <BrazenBraden> okie
[23:33:08] <duch_kazatel> good luck.  i need to head to bed.
[23:33:21] <Cork> 99% of the time when you want to work with the values on an element you want the prop
[23:33:39] <Cork> cause attributes is the static string that was parsed from the html
[23:33:48] <Cork> it for example isn't always live to changes
[23:33:55] <Cork> like checked for example
[23:34:11] <Cork> while properties is what the browser exposes with the current states
[23:34:27] <Cork> one example of where you might want attr is for href
[23:35:00] <BrazenBraden> ahh ok
[23:35:11] <BrazenBraden> that makes sense (more understandable than the api :P)
[23:35:11] <Cork> <a href="#target"> .attr('href') == "#target"; .prop('href') == "http://www.example.com/path/to/file.html#target"
[23:40:11] <BrazenBraden> is there somewhere I can find the order of events that get triggered?
[23:47:14] <BrazenBraden> $('#elem').prop('disabled', false);  removes the disabled status from the select element correct?
[23:53:06] <Cork> BrazenBraden: yes
[23:53:46] <bigbugjava> Hi, I'm using Bootstrap corusal, it works great, the issue is when I try to add dialogs to the page, and it doesn't matter what dialogs, the corusal disappears
[23:53:49] <BrazenBraden> ok just confirming for once I figure out why .mouseleave or .mouseout are not triggering when moving the mouse away from my select element
